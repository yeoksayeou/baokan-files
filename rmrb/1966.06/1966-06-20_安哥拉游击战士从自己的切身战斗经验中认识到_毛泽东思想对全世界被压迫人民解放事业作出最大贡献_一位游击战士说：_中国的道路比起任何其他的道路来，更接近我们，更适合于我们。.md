    Xinhua News Agency, Brazzaville, 18th -- A group of Angolan guerrilla fighters recently told Xinhua reporters that they love and admire Mao Zedong Thought based on their own combat experience.

    An experienced fighter who leads a group of guerrillas in the Cabinda region said that Mao Zedong Thought has made the greatest contribution to the liberation cause of oppressed people and oppressed nations around the world.

    He said: "From the bottom of our hearts, we value Mao Zedong's strategic and tactical thinking on people's war above everything else." "We are very interested in Mao Zedong's guerrilla warfare principles. We try our best to apply these principles to our battles based on the specific conditions of Cabinda. We especially appreciate his policies and methods of mobilizing peasants to participate in the liberation war. I believe that this is very important and very useful for our struggle."

    This fighter for national liberation, full of confidence and enthusiasm, explained to reporters the favorable and unfavorable conditions of their current guerrilla war against Portuguese colonialists in the Cabinda region. Based on these analyses, he believes that the main forms of their national liberation war are currently guerrilla warfare and small-scale annihilation warfare. He expressed that they will accumulate strength and defeat the enemy in the process of a protracted war.

    He said that throughout Angola, the Portuguese colonial authorities have now increased their total number of troops to 60,000 to suppress the national liberation struggle. In the small Cabinda region along the Atlantic coast in northern Angola, a small number of Angolan guerrillas are resisting 5,000 Portuguese colonial troops. These Portuguese troops are equipped with modern weapons and aircraft provided by U.S. imperialism through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said: "We have difficulties, but we also have favorable conditions that the enemy will never have. Our war is a just war, and the enemy's war is an evil and unjust war. We have the support of the people. We have terrain and forests that are conducive to guerrilla warfare. Moreover, the trend of historical development is that decadent colonialism and imperialism are bound to perish, and the national liberation struggles in Africa and the world are bound to win."

    The environment in which the Angolan guerrillas fight in the Cabinda region is harsh. Day and night, they operate in the famous, boundless, and dense Mayombe Forest. Deep in the forest, it drizzles all day long, the sun is not visible, clothes cannot dry for three days, and there are mosquitoes and wild animals everywhere. However, the Angolan guerrilla fighters are full of confidence in their future, operate in small detachments, and have established decentralized small bases. So far, they have persisted in the struggle for several years. By relying on the local residents in the forest, they have overcome various difficulties and achieved a series of victories against the enemy.

    This guerrilla fighter said: "During combat, we conduct political, military, and cultural education for our guerrillas, thereby strengthening our combat effectiveness. We try to apply the strategy of encircling the cities from the countryside." He emphasized: "China started the revolution by mobilizing the peasants and starting from rural base areas. We believe that the Chinese road is closer to us and more suitable for us than any other road."

    Another fighter who has been fighting with the guerrillas in Cabinda since 1964 particularly enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's discussion on the importance of the relationship between the army and the people. He said that without the support of the local people, Angolan fighters would not be able to survive and continue fighting, so they often remember Chairman Mao's words.

    He said: "The people bring us cassava, bananas, drinking water, and intelligence about the enemy to help us fight. We ourselves come from the people."

    He said that the Portuguese colonial troops often hide in bunkers in towns and large villages and dare not go into the forests. But recently, after discovering that the Angolan guerrillas were becoming more and more active with the help of the local people, the Portuguese troops insidiously used force to compel residents to move from villages in the forest to live and cultivate land around their bunkers, forming "strategic villages" like those in South Vietnam. Their attempt was to isolate the guerrilla fighters, "drain" the water, and "sun" the fish to death. This has brought difficulties to the guerrilla fighters. However, Angolan patriotic forces sent fighters into the "strategic villages" and shattered the enemy's conspiracy. They conducted work among the residents and established "action committees" in these villages. Thanks to the cooperation of the residents, they repeatedly lured Portuguese soldiers out of the bunkers and ambushed and annihilated them on the way. Ambush warfare has become their main method of defeating the enemy.

    A fighter in charge of political education in the guerrilla team showed reporters a mimeographed booklet. This was published by them. The booklet contained a chapter of Chairman Mao's work "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," translated into Portuguese. He told reporters that this is the guerrillas' textbook and the fighters like to read it very much.

    He said that, as far as he knows, the Portuguese colonial military headquarters also issued Chairman Mao's military works to every Portuguese senior officer in an attempt to find ways to deal with the Angolan patriotic armed forces. He said with a smile: "We are sure that they can never, never master Chairman Mao's works, because Mao Zedong's works belong only to the oppressed people of the world who are fighting for justice and liberation."

    He pointed out that after suffering a series of defeats, the Portuguese colonialists recently sent another batch of troops called "suicide squads" to Cabinda. He said, however, that they are in fact paper tigers and are most afraid of death. Whenever they fall into a guerrilla ambush, they abandon all their weapons, ammunition, and supplies and flee in panic. He also said: "Only we can master the laws of guerrilla warfare, because we are fighting for justice, and we are not afraid of death."

    The Angolan people and patriotic armed forces are waging a heroic and tenacious struggle against the Portuguese colonialists supported by the United States. Although they face many obstacles created by imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries, they are determined never to lay down their arms and never to stop fighting. Angolan guerrilla fighters emphasized to reporters: "Once we have taken up arms, we will never put them down, because we know: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'"

    安哥拉游击战士从自己的切身战斗经验中认识到
    毛泽东思想对全世界被压迫人民解放事业作出最大贡献
    一位游击战士说：“中国的道路比起任何其他的道路来，更接近我们，更适合于我们。”
    新华社布拉柴维尔十八日电　一批安哥拉游击战士最近在会见新华社记者时表示，他们根据自己的切身战斗经验，热爱和钦佩毛泽东思想。
    一位率领一批游击队员在喀奔达地区作战的有经验的战士说，毛泽东思想对全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放事业作出了最大的贡献。
    他说：“我们从内心深处，把毛泽东关于人民战争的战略战术看得比什么都重要。”“我们对毛泽东的游击战原则很感兴趣。我们尽力根据喀奔达的具体情况，把这些原则运用于我们的战斗。我们特别赞赏他动员农民参加解放战争的方针和方法。我认为，这是对我们的斗争十分重要和十分有用的。”
    这位争取民族解放的战士满怀信心、满腔热情地对记者说明了他们目前在喀奔达地区对葡萄牙殖民主义者进行的游击战争的有利条件和不利条件。根据这些分析，他认为，他们的民族解放战争目前的主要形式是游击战和小规模的歼灭战。他表示将在持久战过程中，积蓄力量，打败敌人。
    他说，在整个安哥拉，葡萄牙殖民当局现在把它的军队总数增加到六万人来镇压民族解放斗争。在安哥拉北部沿大西洋海岸一带的小小的喀奔达地区，人数不多的安哥拉游击队正在抗击五千名葡萄牙殖民军。这些葡萄牙军队配备有美帝国主义通过北大西洋公约组织提供的现代化武器和飞机。他说：“我们有困难，但是也有着敌人决不会有的有利条件。我们的战争是正义的战争，敌人的战争是罪恶的、非正义的战争。我们有人民的支持。我们有着有利于游击战的地形和森林。而且，历史发展的趋势是，腐朽的殖民主义和帝国主义必定灭亡，非洲和世界的民族解放斗争必定胜利。”
    安哥拉游击队在喀奔达地区进行战斗的环境是艰苦的。他们夜以继日，在著名的无边无际的浓密的马约姆贝大森林中活动。在森林深处，整天细雨迷蒙，看不见太阳，衣服三天也晾不干，到处是蚊子和野兽。但是安哥拉游击队战士对自己的未来满怀信心，分成小分队进行作战，并且建立了分散的小基地。到目前为止，他们已经坚持了几年的斗争。他们由于依靠森林中的当地居民，克服了种种困难，对敌人取得了一系列的胜利。
    这位游击战士说：“在战斗期间，我们向我们的游击队员进行政治、军事和文化教育，从而加强我们的战斗力。我们试图运用农村包围城市的战略。”他强调说：“中国通过动员农民，从农村的根据地开始革命，我们认为，中国的道路比起任何其他的道路来，更接近我们，更适合于我们。”
    从一九六四年起在喀奔达同游击队员一起战斗的另一位战士特别热烈赞扬毛主席关于重视军民关系的论述。他说，如果没有当地人民的支持，安哥拉战士是无法生存和继续战斗的，因此他们经常记着毛主席的话。
    他说：“人民给我们带来了木薯、香蕉、饮水和关于敌人的情报，帮助我们作战。我们自己就是来自人民的。”
    他说，葡萄牙殖民军经常躲在城镇和大村庄的碉堡里，不敢到森林里来。但是最近，葡萄牙军队在发现安哥拉游击队在当地人民的协助下越来越活跃之后，阴险地用武力强迫居民从森林里的村庄迁到他们的碉堡周围居住和耕种土地，形成象南越的那种“战略村”。他们的企图是要孤立游击战士，把水“抽干”，把鱼“晒”死。这给游击战士带来了困难。但是，安哥拉爱国力量派战士进入“战略村”，粉碎了敌人的阴谋。他们在居民中间进行工作，在这些村建立了“行动委员会”。由于居民的合作，他们多次把葡萄牙士兵诱出碉堡，在途中伏击歼灭他们。伏击战已成为他们战胜敌人的主要方法。
    在游击队中负责政治教育的一位战士给记者看了一本油印小册子。这是他们出版的，小册子中刊载了译成葡萄牙文的毛主席著作《中国革命战争的战略问题》的一章。他对记者说，这是游击战士的教科书，战士们非常喜欢读。
    他说，据他所知，葡萄牙殖民军司令部也把毛主席军事著作发给每一个葡萄牙高级军官，以图寻找对付安哥拉爱国武装力量的办法。他笑着说：“我们肯定，他们决不能，决不能掌握毛主席著作，因为毛泽东著作只属于世界上为正义和解放而斗争的被压迫人民。”
    他指出，葡萄牙殖民主义者在遭受一系列失败以后，最近又增派一批叫作“敢死队”的军队到喀奔达去。他说，但是，他们事实上是纸老虎，最怕死。每当他们中了游击队的伏击，就扔下全部武器、弹药和给养，狼狈逃命。他又说：“只有我们能掌握游击战的规律，因为我们是为正义而战斗的，我们不怕死。”
    安哥拉人民和爱国武装力量正在为反对得到美国支持的葡萄牙殖民主义者而进行英勇顽强的斗争。虽然他们面临帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和反动派所制造的重重障碍，他们决心绝不放下武器，决不停止战斗。安哥拉游击队战士们向记者强调说：“我们一拿起了武器，就决不会放下，因为我们知道：‘枪杆子里面出政权’。”
