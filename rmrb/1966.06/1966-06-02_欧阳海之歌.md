    The Song of Ouyang Hai
    Jin Jingmai
    (Continued from yesterday)
    The door creaked open. A bunch of landlord's brats swarmed out of the vermilion gate, each one fat-headed and big-eared, wearing leather robes with mandarin jackets over them, jumping and running, looking like several leather balls rolling down the steps. They shouted and laughed:
    "Beat the beggar! Beat this fake girl!"
    "See who hits his head first!"
    Snowballs burst on Xiao Hai's body. Xiao Hai was stunned by this sudden insult and stood there not knowing whether to dodge or run. Then, a snowball hit near Xiao Hai's eye socket, and the brats yelled triumphantly:
    "Well done!"
    "I hit him first, I hit him first!"
    Xiao Hai recognized the voice of Liu Da Dou's tenth young master. He threw down the begging basket and stick, facing the snowballs, and ran towards that tenth young master with the two yellow snot trails, kicking him and knocking the brat to the ground. Xiao Hai climbed on top, using all his strength to smash a snowball hard on the tenth young master's flat face. Just then, a yellow dog rushed out of the gate.
    "'Lai Xi', 'Lai Xi', sic him!" the flat-faced boy lying on the ground yelled.
    The yellow dog "Lai Xi" opened its mouth and lunged at Xiao Hai. Xiao Hai turned to pick up the stick, but the yellow dog had already bitten his left leg. Stumbling, Xiao Hai fell into the snow.
    Ouyang Hai slowly got up from the snow. A large chunk of skin and flesh had been torn from his left calf by the yellow dog, and blood was flowing down his leg. Ignoring the pain, he firmly held two snowballs, preparing to take revenge, cursing in his heart: "You're the beggar! Every year we carry the rent grain to feed you…"
    With a bang, the door slammed shut. Inside, the brats' triumphant laughter could be heard.
    Everyone had run away, and the pair of stone lions in front of the gate still glared at Xiao Hai. Xiao Hai raised his eyebrows, and a burst of anger flashed in his eyes. He smashed the snowballs hard at the snarling lions, saying to himself:
    "You're so arrogant? One day, one day I'll ride on your back! Hmph, just wait and see!"
    Xiao Hai limped towards Lao Ya Wo. Another lonely figure was moving on the mountaintop; a new line of footprints was left on the pure white snow, clearly imprinted. Next to the snow pit left by his left foot, bright red blood seeped clearly into the white snow, also clearly imprinted in Xiao Hai's heart.
    Back at his doorstep, his mother greeted him: "San San, did you get any?"
    Seeing his family, Xiao Hai remembered all the grievances he had suffered, his nose felt sore, and he wanted to hold his mother and cry. But seeing his mother's worried expression, he held back his tears and snapped the dog-beating stick into two.
    "Mom! I won't wear this coat, and I won't beg anymore! I, I'd rather starve than beg!"
    "Ah! Did someone bully you? Child, come here and let me see."
    "Mom, I'll chop firewood, I'll help Dad burn charcoal! Mom, don't think I'm small, I can carry as much as I can... I, I'll never beg again." Xiao Hai finished speaking, took off his sister's worn-out jacket, and turned to run towards the firewood pile.
    His mother picked up the jacket and the broken dog-beating stick, not knowing what had happened. The careful sister saw a patch of bright red blood where Xiao Hai had stood and quickly pushed her mother back into the house.
    In the firewood pile, Xiao Hai, wearing only a thin layer of clothing, picked up a rusty pair of scissors and tore and pulled off his half-grown hair. He had only one thought in his mind: I will never beg again, I will chop firewood! He picked up his dad's machete and was about to run out when his sister stopped him.
    "Sister, I…" Xiao Hai looked at his sister's worried expression and quickly said, "I'm going to chop firewood, I'll never beg again!"
    His sister repeated, "Yes, never… beg again."
    Seeing her little brother's bloody left leg, she hugged Xiao Hai tightly to her chest, two glistening tears hanging on her delicate face, and said haltingly:
    "San San, this begging… it should have been your sister who went…"
    "No, good sister! Don't go begging, and I won't beg either. Even if we run out of food, we won't beg. We'll follow Dad to chop firewood!"
    Yu Ying, his sister, took out a pinch of red sugar mixed with chili peppers that she had just asked for from old Granny Xing next door, and said:
    "San San, bear with it, sister will put some medicine on it for you. I told you not to beg at the wealthy people's houses! ... Was it bitten by a dog again!"
    "Don't let Mom know!" Xiao Hai replied, two bursts of piercing anger flashing in his bright eyes.
    "Does it hurt, San San?" his sister asked, applying the chili peppers to the wound.
    "No!…" Xiao Hai replied, clenching his thick eyebrows, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.
    The heavy snow was still falling silently. The footprints on the road were filled with snow, and the blood stains were also covered by the snow. However, the hatred in Xiao Hai's heart was firmly rooted.

    Three. New Year
    The pine tree in front of the door had grown taller again. Ouyang Hai had been chopping firewood and burning charcoal for a whole year.

    His older brother had been missing for several years with no news. Though he was gone, the debt incurred to avoid being drafted was increasing day by day. The landlord, Liu Manlu, explicitly stated that the interest was "20%," but he measured in with a large bushel and measured out with a small bushel, and all the sweat and labor of Xiao Hai's family for a year was not enough to pay off the interest. As the end of the year approached, the landlord sent word for Ouyang Hengwen to follow them down the mountain "for a trip." The whole family knew that disaster was imminent and cautiously sent their father off at the foot of the mountain.

    Ouyang Hengwen arrived at the Liu family mansion and was led into the main room. Lifting the cotton curtain, Liu Da Dou was half-reclined on a tiger-skin armchair, using a foot warmer to relax. The room was warm, but Hengwen felt a chill all over his body, and after a long time, he uttered a few words:
    "I… I've come."
    "Well, take the money to the accounting room." Liu Da Dou smirked without opening his eyes.
    "I've paid as much as I can. On the fifteenth of August, I sent some interest to your household…"
    "I told you to take the money to the accounting room!" Liu Da Dou opened his swollen eyes and glanced at Ouyang Hengwen before closing them again.
    "This year, this year there's really no way. Please grant me another year."
    The landlord clicked his tongue but didn't say anything.
    "... Your family has a big business and doesn't care about my few pennies," Ouyang Hengwen pleaded. "In a few days, I'll burn two kilns of good charcoal and send them to your household. The weather looks cold!"
    The landlord sat up with a jolt, the black pupils in his swollen eyes bulging out like the eyes of a dead rat. He roared:
    "What? You want to use two kilns of charcoal to get by for another year! My family's business is big, and my expenses are also big. I can't just live by burning fire! I lent you golden grain seeds, and you want to exchange them for pitch-black charcoal? ... Forget it, this year we'll settle both the principal and the interest. Settle the accounts on the thirtieth, next year I want some peace."
    "Sir, Song Ya Zi was taken away by you, and there hasn't been a word for several years. This 'draft donation' that I paid is unfair! Once the borrowed grain passes through my hands, doesn't it end up back in your granary anyway..." Hengwen said, his voice changed in anger.
    "'Suppressing rebellion and building the nation, everyone is responsible,' what does donating a bit count for! Besides, sending away your Song Ya Zi saves you a share of food, I'm doing this for his future." Seeing that Hengwen didn't say anything, the landlord changed his expression and said, "Alas! I've also calculated for you: you can't get cash for a while; that five-fen piece of land on your sunny slope... The geomancer said, the feng shui is still okay..."
    "What!" Ouyang Hengwen's brain buzzed as if it were about to crack open. He thought to himself that the sunny five-fen slope was dug out by hand, and how much sweat had generations of people poured into that land. During the great drought of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, two of Song Ya Zi's younger sons starved to death, but they still didn't sell that five-fen piece of land... No! Absolutely not!
    "This land—" Hengwen just opened his mouth.
    "I have guests." Liu Da Dou stood up and took out a written document from his pocket, "You can carefully consider it again. The land, I'll still lease it to you to farm first, I'm saving it for after the old master passes away." He turned back at the door, "Once you've considered it, as long as you put your fingerprint on it, this year's interest will be settled; otherwise, we'll see you at the county government."
    Ouyang Hengwen understood: this was forcing him to pay the debt and seize the land! ... He quickly grabbed Liu Da Dou's lapel:
    "You, you… you're going to take the lives of our whole family!"
    Outside the door, the walking stick tapped the floor steadily, and Pan Baochang, reeking of alcohol and with a toothpick in his mouth, walked in.
    "Hengwen!" he said, "You black-footed peasants are just stubborn. Why can't you see reason! Once your Song Ya Zi becomes a high-ranking official and comes back, won't you be able to buy houses and land as you please? Listen to me, just put your fingerprint on it!"
    Ouyang Hengwen held his hands tightly to his chest and said repeatedly: "No, no! Baochang, you have to act according to heavenly principles. We mountain people, without land, what are we supposed to rely on? Song Ya Zi was taken away by you…"
    "Then it's up to you." Pan Baochang pushed Hengwen away with his walking stick and said to Liu Da Dou, "Manlu, Secretary-General Hu of the county party headquarters is waiting for you in the hall."
    Hengwen grabbed the document, took a step forward and blocked Liu Da Dou, saying: "Sir, I'll make it clear, I absolutely cannot sell the land; ... The interest, I, I'll sell my sons and daughters, sell this old body of mine to pay you!"
    Liu Da Dou bared his teeth: "Alright! Since Baochang is here, I'll also make it clear: old debts don't carry over to the new year. Today is the eighteenth of the twelfth month, I'll be waiting for your money to use on the thirtieth." He turned his head towards the Baochang, "If the deadline passes, then we'll… huh? Hahahaha." The two laughed and walked away.
    Ouyang Hengwen walked out of the Liu family mansion in a daze. The yellow dog "Lai Xi" was still chasing him and barking a few times. He climbed up the mountain with one foot high and one foot low. The gusts of cold wind couldn't make him clear-headed. With every step he took, he said to himself: "I can't sell the land!" "I can't sell the land!" ... Where could he find the money? He didn't know. In a trance, he came to the sunny slope of land, and looking at this black oily soil, his legs softened and he sat on the edge of the field. He held a handful of black soil in both hands, and the warmth from the soil immediately transmitted to his heart. Hengwen looked fixedly through tears and said, "We dug this out by hand, watered it with sweat! Six or seven generations have worked hard to cultivate this piece of land. If Liu Da Dou seizes it, I... I won't be reconciled!" He turned his head and looked at the Liu family mansion at the foot of the mountain, and said gnashing his teeth, "The Liu family, you are so ruthless! You will have no descendants, struck by heavenly fire!" He kept rubbing the soil in his palm, muttering, "Can't sell it! Can't sell it!" But in his heart, he already vaguely felt: "It's over, it's… over! This family… is ruined in my hands!"
    In the afternoon of the eighteenth of the twelfth month, a wisp of white smoke rose from the north slope of Lao Ya Wo. Ouyang Hengwen was lighting a fire to burn charcoal in the earthen kiln. The whole family went into action. They chopped the wood, carried the wood, and even Mom carried the fourth younger sister up the mountain. From that day on, Dad stayed at the kiln door day and night without returning. Eight-year-old Ouyang Hai could carry thirty jin at a time. As soon as the charcoal came out of the kiln, no matter where the fair was, he would follow Mom and sister to carry the charcoal to sell; the market town was filled with Xiao Hai's clear voice calling out for sales all day long. It was just that the weather was not cooperating, for several days in a row it was sunny, the weather wasn't cold, and the charcoal couldn't sell for a good price; sometimes a load of charcoal was carried out, back and forth for forty or fifty miles, and carried back intact.
    On the evening of the twenty-ninth, Dad turned out the money from the bedside again. Counting it over and over, it was not enough to pay the odd change for Liu Da Dou's interest. The whole family looked at those several flattened golden yuan notes, sighing and not falling asleep. For the past few days, in order to collect the hellish debt, they had not even dared to drink big mouthfuls of sweet potato soup. The deadline was tomorrow, what could they use to save the sunny slope of land?

    The fourth younger sister seemed to be especially good tonight, not crying at all. Mom put the nipple to her mouth several times, but she didn't want to eat much. It was unknown whether she pitied Mom for not having any milk, or whether she herself didn't have the strength to suckle.
    Ouyang Hai curled up in the straw pile to spend the night. In the middle of the night, the wind rose, and the north wind shook the broken door, making creaking sounds. He climbed up, carried a bundle of firewood to block the door, and then grabbed a few more handfuls of thatch to cover himself. ...Drowsily, it seemed that his sister pushed the door open and came in. His sister said, "San San, come on, I'll take you to catch fish, you haven't eaten fish before, have you?" Xiao Hai thought, yes, some time ago, Granny Xing next door said that looking at her expression, the fourth younger sister might not make it, and she told Mom to find a way to get some small fish and simmer them into a soup, saying that fish soup could produce milk... "Yes, Mom doesn't have any milk, no wonder the fourth younger sister cries from hunger all day long, it would be good if I could catch two fish for Mom." Xiao Hai thought, and followed his sister to the side of the paddy field. Heavens, so many fish! Groups of them were swimming on the surface of the water. They reached out to catch them, but the fish swam to the middle of the field. Xiao Hai rolled up his trousers and aimed at a big fish, jumping into the field with a thud. Oh no! He felt a chilling cold under his feet and quickly pulled his legs back, only to hear a cracking sound—the bundle of firewood by the door was knocked over by him. ...Xiao Hai woke up from his dream, and found that snowflakes were passing through the cracks in the door and had thickly covered his feet. Outside the door, it was a silver world.
    "It's snowing!" Xiao Hai jumped up happily, "Mom, look, it's snowing, so much snow!"
    Mom responded, "I know."
    "Tomorrow is the fair in Lianxi again, I'll carry the charcoal to the town to sell, I'll definitely be able to sell it for a good price."
    "Go to sleep, San San."
    Xiao Hai was so excited that he couldn't sleep anymore. He tidied up the carrying pole and bamboo baskets, and said to himself: "Tomorrow, I'll carry forty jin, don't be afraid, I can always make it to the fair if I rest more times." Looking at the sky, it was still very early. He went back to the straw pile and lay down, covering his feet tightly with a large pile of firewood. The cold wind drilled straight into his body through the cracks in the wall, freezing Xiao Hai's upper and lower teeth to knock against each other. He was saying to himself: "Snow, snow! If it doesn't snow a lot, my dad won't be able to pay off the debt! The bigger the snow, the better, the bigger the..." Gradually, he returned to his dream. ...
    At the Lianxi fair, Xiao Hai carried that load of charcoal and called out for sales back and forth a dozen times, but no one responded to him. It was the thirtieth day of the year, and the shops had all boarded up their doors, with door gods riding Qilin and holding swords pasted on them; in the cold wind, several couplets that were not firmly glued on, written with "Business is booming all over the world" and "Financial resources are flourishing to the three rivers", were shaking. In the Liu family mansion's courtyard, the dog sons had already started setting off firecrackers. Xiao Hai felt that the load on his shoulders was getting heavier and heavier, and he was too lazy to even look at the pair of amusing stone lions.
    At the entrance to the street vegetable market, there were still a few old men, holding baking baskets, waiting at their stalls. An old man shouted, and Xiao Hai quickly ran over.
    "Boy, buy two pieces of glutinous rice cake to go home and celebrate the new year."
    When Xiao Hai heard this, he ignored him and turned to leave.
    "Come, come, come, buy a fish, fresh ones!" Another old man shouted.
    "Fish!" Xiao Hai carried the charcoal to the front and looked and looked, he opened his small mouth half-open and reluctantly left.
    Xiao Hai was walking on the street. Suddenly, he thought of the blacksmith master, so he quickened his pace towards the blacksmith's furnace. He thought to himself: "My load of charcoal is good, the master will definitely want it." Just around the corner, he saw from afar that the blacksmith's furnace door was surrounded by people, and a yellow walking stick was waving wildly in the crowd.
    "Go, go! What is there to see? 'Murder must be paid with life, debts must be paid with money', this is the old rule." The Baochang shouted, "Li the blacksmith owes the Liu family money not for a day or two, his grandfather's old debt has not been cleared until now. Today is the thirtieth day of the year, which family is not waiting for money to spend? Master Liu is looking at the face of the neighbors, and only sealed his shop, hmph! Otherwise he would have been sent to the officials long ago!"
    Xiao Hai squeezed into the crowd, and saw a Bao Ding was pasting two seals crosswise on the door, the white paper black words above with two blood red seals. He looked at the seals, not knowing what had happened.
    People were all gone. Xiao Hai found that there was still a person sitting by the door: bent over, lowered head, wearing only a set of single trousers.
    "Master?!..."
    The blacksmith master raised his head and said, "Boy, are you here to warm yourself by the fire? ...You're late! These," he pointed to the back of his body, "these are all other people's! It's the Liu family's!"
    "Master," Xiao Hai seemed to understand, "No. I, I came to give you charcoal..."
    The blacksmith smiled miserably: "I don't have any money, only this set of single trousers left, I don't have anything!"
    Xiao Hai thought of the red furnace fire, thought of the blacksmith master's warm sweet potatoes. How many snowy days, this, was the only place where he could get warmth when he came out. Now, there was not even a place to rest his feet. He said sadly:
    "I, I don't want money. I can chop firewood, I can burn charcoal with my dad."
    "Boy, it's hard for you to have this good heart. Hurry up and sell the charcoal and go home, your dad is waiting for you. Go, huh?"
    Xiao Hai left the blacksmith master, feeling that his legs were heavier, and he finally moved back to the side of the vegetable market. He squatted there alone, the two blood red seals on the seal were always turning in his mind.
    The sky was gradually darkening. From the shops came the shouts of guessing boxing and drinking games, it was time for the family reunion dinner, Xiao Hai was still guarding at the vegetable market eagerly.
    "Boy, you haven't left yet!" The old man selling glutinous rice cakes passed by here and said sympathetically, "Go home and celebrate the New Year. Rich people, they have all bought their New Year goods on the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month; those who don't have money, how can they be in the mood to buy charcoal to heat the fire today!"
    Another person also said: "Come back after the fifth day of the first lunar month, there will be no business these few days."
    Xiao Hai thought: "It's not early, Mom should be getting anxious waiting, let's go back..." He picked up the charcoal, as if he saw Dad's worried face again; the two seals with blood red seals were also turning in front of him.
    "If I don't sell a few coins, how can I go back?" Thinking of this, he stopped the old men and said: "Old men, please do good, buy my load of charcoal back to heat the fire. My dad is waiting for the money to pay the bills."
    The old man smiled bitterly and said: "If I didn't owe bills, I wouldn't be sitting on the cold bench today."
    Xiao Hai begged: "Buy it, I'll make it cheaper."
    The old man selling fish also came over and said: "Do good to the end, you leave half of the charcoal to me, and take two fish back. At least it counts as celebrating the New Year."
    Fish! Last night in his dream he was catching fish. Seeing the fish, Xiao Hai seemed to see Mom's slightly twitching mouth again, and the fourth younger sister's hoarse crying rang in his ears again... He made a cruel decision:
    "Okay, I only want a small fish and a piece of glutinous rice cake. You do good deeds and give me a few coins. My dad he..."
    The old men looked at each other, only sighed and did not say anything, everyone gathered a few coins and gave them to Xiao Hai. The old man selling glutinous rice cakes picked up two pieces of glutinous rice cake and stuffed them into Xiao Hai's hands.
    "Boy, you...go back early!"
    Xiao Hai turned to leave, and another old man stopped him:
    "Wait, boy, you...you pick two more fish to take back!"
    Xiao Hai looked at them gratefully, picked two of the smallest fish with tears in his eyes.
    Xiao Hai said goodbye to the old men and walked back, he was thinking: "Give the fish and glutinous rice cake to Mom, as long as Mom has milk, the fourth younger sister will not cry again. Poor fourth younger sister, she's a full year old, I haven't seen her smile. …" Suddenly, he saw from afar that the pair of stone lions in front of the Liu family mansion were baring their teeth and glaring at him. Xiao Hai screamed: "Oh no, what if I meet Liu Da Dou! He will snatch the fish and glutinous rice cake. No way!" Thinking of this, Xiao Hai quickly turned into a narrow alley, hid everything in his arms, and fastened his belt tightly, then he ran home with peace of mind.
    It was completely dark when Xiao Hai rushed to the mountain. He saw from afar that Yu Ying sister was holding a torch and guarding at the mountain pass, waiting for him to come back.
    The house was quiet, and the lights were not lit. The fourth younger sister was lying in bed, probably asleep; Dad was pinching the few golden yuan notes that he did not know how many times he had counted, sitting woodenly next to the fire pit; Mom was crying sadly. Xiao Hai shouted as soon as he entered the door:
    "Dad, this is the money from selling charcoal."
    Dad took the money and counted it, his eyebrows tightly locked together. He suddenly stood up:
    "Just this few coins?"
    Xiao Hai was stunned when he saw Dad's livid face.
    Dad grabbed Xiao Hai: "Say, what did you buy to eat?"
    Xiao Hai had difficulty defending himself: "I, I..."
    The muscles on Dad's face were twitching terribly: "You don't know that the family is waiting for money to use, you don't know that the family is waiting for money to pay the bills?" He said while stomping his feet, "I, I...I'll beat you to death, you glutton!" He pushed Xiao Hai to the ground and picked up a stick.
    Mom hurried over to protect Xiao Hai: "His dad, the interest is not enough anyway, San San has not eaten a full meal all year round, today is the New Year, you, you just spare him this time!"
    Sister stopped Dad and shouted: "Dad! If you want to hit, you hit me! San San is small, he doesn't understand..."
    "Say! Where did the money go? If you don't tell the truth, see how I will deal with you today!"
    Xiao Hai held back his tears and slowly climbed up from the ground: "No one wanted the charcoal, I saw that the fourth younger sister was hungry and suffering, and Mom had no milk, ... I exchanged the charcoal for a little food." As he spoke, he untied his belt, took out two small fish and glutinous rice cake from his arms, and trembled and put them in front of Dad.
    Seeing the fish in Xiao Hai's hand, the whole family was stunned. Dad seemed unable to stand firmly, swaying backwards a few steps, the stick fell from his hand, and the golden yuan notes were scattered all over the ground. He stood there blankly, after a long while, he rushed forward two steps, and hugged Xiao Hai tightly to his chest, his lips were shaking up and down, and he could not say a word for a long time. Yes, when did Xiao Hai ever crave food, wasn't it for the poor fourth girl!
    "Dad wronged you! Child, I..." Hengwen looked around, as if looking for something. Suddenly, he clenched his fist and hit his chest hard. While he hit, he howled:
    "I'm confused! I'm confused! ..."
    This punch by punch was like hitting the hearts of the whole family.
    "San San, you don't know the difficulties of Dad! The five-fen land on the south slope... is gone!" Hengwen pointed at the glutinous rice cake in Xiao Hai's hand and said, "These things, are not for us to eat!"
    "I know, Dad!" Xiao Hai felt a burst of ice cold on his forehead, Dad's tears were dripping on his face.
    Looking at the glutinous rice cake, looking at the fish, the whole family thought of the five-fen land on the slope. Sister was secretly crying on the side; Mom gasped, and fell to the foot of the bed. ...
    Dad raised his head and said: "The land can't be kept, can't be kept! I only hope that Song Ya Zi will come back early, and our family can live in peace."
    Two pieces of glutinous rice cake, exactly half a piece per person, this is also called a "reunion dinner"; the simmered fish soup, clear and light, was only one bowl, sister held it and sent it to Mom's hand.
    "Mom, you drink it."
    "San San, come here! You drink two sips first." Mom shouted.
    Xiao Hai did not move.
    "Come here!" Mom was still shouting.
    Dad spoke: "I tell you to drink, you drink it while it's hot."
    Mom put the bowl to her mouth several times, opened her mouth and put the bowl down again. How could she swallow this bowl of fish soup! She said while rubbing her heart:
    "Ying girl, take the bowl over, I, I'm choked here."
    "Mom, drink it, the fourth younger sister is waiting to eat milk!" Sister put the fish soup in Mom's hand and turned to pick up the fourth younger sister inside the bed.
    "Yes, it's time to breastfeed." Mom was thinking, "Other children her age could run all over the place, but the fourth younger sister cannot even sit firmly." She mustered up the courage to put the bowl to her mouth again.
    Suddenly, sister screamed:
    "Mom! Look, the fourth younger sister she...she..."
    "Ah!" Mom was shocked, the bowl shattered with a bang. She quickly took the fourth younger sister from Yu Ying's hands...
    The small house was in a flurry. The fourth younger sister, who had lived a whole year, was already cold all over. ...
    Xiao Hai, who had been working hard for a few days, was grabbing half a piece of glutinous rice cake and fell asleep by the fire pit. In his dream, he was catching fish for the fourth younger sister. One lively fish after another was swimming in front of him. He slightly opened his small mouth, revealing a faint smile. He did not know that his poor fourth younger sister no longer needed fish soup forever, no longer needed milk.
    A cry came from the thatched hut, the family was crying for the early death of the fourth younger sister, for the lost five-fen sunny slope, for the countless disasters.
    The snow was falling even heavier. Pieces of goose feather snow, rolling, swirling, silently swooping towards the mountains, swooping towards Lao Ya Wo, swooping towards Ouyang Hai's small thatched hut that could not block the wind and snow. Cold, hunger, death, like a revolving lantern in front of the people in the mountainous area, turned again and again. Year after year, people welcomed the newborn children with tears, and then sent away the early dying infants with tears; one after another, the children came out of their mother's womb with empty stomachs, and then left the world with empty stomachs... When will this murderous old society collapse; when will the suffering Chinese people see the sunny days again!
    The watchman's drum came, it was the jiazi time. Firecrackers sounded in the distance, it was the moment of sending off the old and welcoming the new: the old year passed silently; the new year had begun.
    The pine tree in front of the door quietly added another ring of annual rings. (To be continued) (Attached image)

    欧阳海之歌
    金敬迈
    （续昨）
    门吱的一声大开了。朱漆大门里涌出来一帮地主的小崽子，一个个肥头胖耳，皮袍子外边还套着马褂，又跳又跑，活象几个皮球从台阶上滚了下来。他们笑着喊着：
    “打讨米的叫化子呀！打这个假丫头！”
    “看哪个先打中他的脑壳！”
    一团团的雪球在小海身上开了花。小海被这突如其来的侮辱气傻了，竟站在那里不知道躲也不知道跑。紧接着，一团雪球砸在小海的眼窝旁边，小崽子们得意忘形地叫了起来：
    “打得好！”
    “是我先打中的，是我先打中的！”
    小海听出这是刘大斗十少爷的声音。他扔下讨米篮和棍子，迎着雪球，朝那个拖着两条黄龙鼻涕的十少爷奔过去，飞起一脚，小崽子趴在地上了。小海翻身上去，拼尽全力把一团雪球狠狠地砸在十少爷的扁脸上。就在这个时候，大门里冲出来一条黄狗。
    “‘来喜’‘来喜’，上！”扁脸躺在地上叫着。
    黄狗“来喜”张着大嘴朝小海扑了过来。小海转身想拣棍子，左腿已经被黄狗咬住。一个踉跄，小海跌倒在雪地里。
    欧阳海慢慢地从雪地里爬起来，左腿肚子上连皮带肉被黄狗撕去了一大块，血正顺着腿肚子往下流着。他顾不得腿疼，紧紧捏好两个雪球准备报仇，心里在骂：“你才是讨米的哩！年年都是我们把租谷挑来养活你们……”
    嘭的一声，大门关死了。门里传来小崽子们得意的嘻笑声。
    人都跑光了，门前那一对石头狮子还朝小海瞪着眼睛。小海眉毛一扬，眼里迸出一股怒火，把雪球使劲砸向呲牙咧嘴的狮子，心里说：
    “你也神气？总有一天，总有一天我会骑到你背上来的！哼，看吧！”
    小海一跛一跛地朝老鸦窝走去。山顶上又移动着一个孤孤单单的人影；洁白的雪地上又踏出一行新的足迹，脚印清晰地印在雪地上。在左脚踩出的雪窝旁边，殷红的血清清楚楚地渗在白雪上，也清清楚楚地留在小海心里。
    回到家门口，妈妈迎了出来：“三三，讨着了？”
    见到了亲人，小海想起了一肚子的委屈，鼻子发酸，想抱着妈妈哭一场。可是看见妈妈愁眉苦脸的样子，他又忍住了眼泪，咔的一声把打狗棍折成两截。
    “妈！我不穿这件衣服，我也不讨米了！我，我就是饿死也不讨米了！”
    “啊！有人欺负你了？儿呵，快过来给我看看。”
    “妈，我打柴，我帮爹爹烧炭去！妈，你莫看我小，我能挑多少是多少，……我，我再也不讨米了。”小海说完，脱下了姐姐的那件破夹袄，扭头朝柴草堆跑去。
    妈妈拾起夹袄，拣起折断的打狗棍，不知道发生了什么事情。细心的姐姐看见小海站过的地方，留下了一块鲜红的血迹，急忙把妈妈推回屋里去。
    柴草堆里，小海穿着一身单衣，拿起一把生锈的剪刀，连扯带抓地把半长的头发都剪了下来。心里只有一个念头：我再也不讨米了，我要砍柴去！他拿起爹爹的那把砍刀，正要往外跑，姐姐拦住了他。
    “姐姐，我……”小海看着姐姐担心的样子，连忙说，“我是砍柴去，我再也不讨米了！”
    姐姐重复着：“是呵，再也……不讨米了。”
    看见弟弟血淋淋的左腿，她一把把小海搂在胸前，两颗晶莹的泪珠挂在她清秀的脸上，断断续续地说：
    “三三，这讨米的事……本该是姐姐去的……”
    “不，好姐姐！你莫去讨，我也不讨了，断了粮我们也不讨。我们跟着爹爹砍柴去！”
    玉英姐姐拿出一撮刚从隔壁杏婆婆屋里要来的红糖拌辣椒，说：
    “三三，你忍着点呵，姐姐给你搽点药。叫你莫到大户人家去讨嘛！……又是让狗子咬了吧！”
    “莫让妈妈晓得了！”小海回答着，明亮的眼睛里闪出两股逼人的怒气。
    “疼吗？三三。”姐姐把辣椒抹在伤口上问着。
    “不！……”小海紧锁着两道浓眉回答，额头上憋出了一颗颗豆大的汗珠。
    大雪还在不声不响地飘着。路上的脚印子被雪填平了，血迹也被大雪盖住了。可是，小海心上的仇恨，却牢牢地种下了根。
    三、过年
    门前的松树又长高了一截，欧阳海砍柴烧炭一年整。
    大哥几年来杳无音讯。人不在了，为躲壮丁欠下的债还一天天在往上涨。地主刘满禄言明是“加二”的利，可是他大斗进、小斗出，小海全家一年的汗水所得还交不起利钱。年关将近，地主派人传下话来，叫欧阳恒文跟着到山下“去一趟”。全家知道大祸临头，战战兢兢地把爹爹送出山口。
    欧阳恒文到了刘家大屋，被人领进上房。撩开棉布门帘，刘大斗正踩着烘篮半躺在虎皮太师椅上养神。房里暖烘烘的，恒文却感到浑身发冷，半天才吐出几个字来：
    “我……我来了。”
    “嗯，把钱交到账房柜上去。”刘大斗咧了咧嘴，还没睁开他养神的眼睛。
    “我能交的都交了，八月十五，我就给府上送过些利钱来了……”
    “我叫你把钱交到账房上去！”刘大斗睁开肿眼泡瞟了欧阳恒文一眼，又闭上了。
    “今年，今年实在没得办法，求你再宽一年。”
    地主啧了啧嘴巴没吭声。
    “……你家大业大，不在乎我这几个小钱。”欧阳恒文恳求着说，“过天把，我给府上烧两窑好炭送来。这天气看冷哪！”
    地主一翻身坐了起来，肿眼泡里的黑眼珠就象死耗子的眼珠似的全鼓出来了。他吼着：
    “什么？你又想拿两窑炭来混一年哪！我家大业大，开销也大。我不能光靠烤火过日子！黄灿灿的谷种借给你，你想拿墨黑墨黑的炭来换？……算啦，今年我们本利两清，三十晚上结账，明年我还要图个清闲。”
    “老爷，嵩伢子让你们抓走了，好几年是只字不见，这‘壮丁捐’我出得冤枉呵！借的谷子一倒手，还不是又倒回你老爷的仓里了……”恒文气得声音都变了。
    “‘戡乱建国，人人有责’，上点把捐算什么！再说，送走了你嵩伢子，省了你一份口粮，我这是为了出息他。”看见恒文没作声，地主换了副面孔说，“唉！我也替你盘算过：现钱，你一时也拿不出来；你坡上向阳的那五分地……阴阳先生说，风水嘛，还可以……”
      “什么！”欧阳恒文脑子里轰的一声，象要裂开来似的。他心里在说，那向阳的五分坡地是用手刨出来的，几代人辛辛苦苦往地里甩下了多少汗水呵。民国二十一年大旱，嵩伢子下头的两个儿子活活饿死了，也没舍得卖那五分地……不能！万万不能呵！
    “这地——”恒文刚开口。
    “我还有客。”刘大斗站起身来，从怀里掏出一张写好的文书，“你自己再过细地盘算盘算。地呢，还是佃给你先种着，我是为老太爷百年之后用的。”走到门口他又回转身来，“盘算过来了，只要你打上个手印，今年的利钱就算清了；不然，我们就县政府见。”
    欧阳恒文明白了：这是逼债夺地呀！……他急忙抓住刘大斗的衣襟：
    “你，你……你这是要了我们全家的命罗！”
    门外，文明棍戳得地板笃笃直响，潘保长满脸酒气，嘴里含着根牙签走了进来。
    “恒文哪！”他说，“你们这些黑脚杆子就是死心眼，你怎么想不开呢！等你嵩伢子当了大官回来，要买房子置地还不都随你的便？听我的，打个手印算了！”
    欧阳恒文把双手死死抱在胸前，连声说：“不能，不能呵！保长先生，我们山里人，没有了地还指望什么哟。你保长办事也要凭个天理，嵩伢子被你们……”
    “那就随你的便罗。”潘保长用文明棍推开恒文，对刘大斗说，“满禄，县党部的胡秘书长在厅里等你哩。”
    恒文抓起文书，抢上一步拦住刘大斗说：“老爷，我把话说明了，地我是万万不能卖的；……利钱，我，我卖儿卖女、卖了我这把骨头来还你！”
    刘大斗呲了呲牙：“好嘛！趁保长在场，我也把话说明：旧账不过新岁。今天是腊月十八，三十晚上我等你的钱用。”他把头转向保长，“要是过了期限，那我们就……呵？哈哈哈。”两人笑着走了。
    欧阳恒文昏昏沉沉地走出刘家大屋，黄狗“来喜”还撵着他叫了几声。他一脚高一脚低地爬上山来，一阵阵的北风也没能使他清醒。走一步他心里念一句：“地我是不能卖！”“地我是不能卖呀！”……上哪儿去找钱呢？他不知道。恍恍惚惚地来到那块向阳的坡地旁边，看着这块黑油油的土地，他双腿一软，坐在地头上了。两手捧起一把黑土，土里的热呼气立刻传到他的心上。恒文透过泪水定神看了看说：“这是我们用手刨、用汗水浇出来的哟！六七代人辛辛苦苦开出了这块地，要是让刘大斗夺了去，我……我这心不甘哪！”他回过头去，望着山下的刘家大屋，咬牙切齿地说，“姓刘的，你真下得了狠心！你这个绝子绝孙，遭天火的！”他把土不停地在手心上揉着，嘴里还在念叨，“不能卖呀！不能卖呀！”可是心里边，已经模模糊糊地感觉到：“完啦，完……啦！这个家……败在我手上啦！”
    腊月十八的后半天，老鸦窝北坡上冒起了一股白烟，欧阳恒文在土窑里生火烧炭了。全家上阵呵，砍的砍，挑的挑，连妈妈也背着四妹子上了山。从这一天起，爹爹整日整夜守在窑门口没有回来过。八岁的欧阳海一次能挑三十来斤，炭刚出窑，不管哪里逢墟，他都跟着妈妈、姐姐挑炭去卖；墟镇上整天响着小海清亮的叫卖声。偏偏老天不作美，一连几天都是好太阳，天不冷，炭卖不上价钱；有时一担炭挑出去，来回四五十里地，又原封不动地挑回来。
    二十九的晚上，爹爹把床头的钱又翻出来，数来数去，不够还刘大斗利钱的零头。全家望着那几张压得平平整整的金圆券，唉声叹气地没有睡着。几天来，为了凑够那笔阎王账，连红薯汤也没舍得大口喝过。眼看期限就在明天，拿什么来保住那块向阳坡地呢？
    四妹子今天晚上好象格外乖，一声也没有哭，妈妈几次把奶头塞到她嘴里，也不大肯吃了。不知道她是可怜妈妈没有奶了，还是她自己已经没有吃奶的力气了。
    欧阳海蜷缩在草堆里过夜。半夜里起风了，北风摇撼着破门，发出吱吱呀呀的响声。他爬起身来，扛了一捆柴禾堵在门边，又多搂了几把茅草盖在身上。……迷迷糊糊地，好象是姐姐推门进来了。姐姐说：“三三，走，我带你抓鱼去，你还没有吃过鱼吧。”小海一想，是呵，前些时隔壁杏婆婆就说，看神色，四妹子怕不行了，叫妈妈想法弄点小鱼煨汤吃，说鱼汤能够发奶……“嗯，妈妈没有奶，怪不得四妹子整天饿得哭哩，要能给妈妈抓两条鱼回来就好了。”小海想着，跟着姐姐来到水田旁边。天哪，好多鱼呵！一群一群都在水面上游哩。他们伸手去抓，鱼又游到田中间去了。小海卷起裤腿，对准一条大鱼，扑通一下跳到田里边。哎呀！他觉得脚底下冷得钻心，急忙缩腿回来，只听咔嚓一声——门边上的那捆柴禾让他蹬倒了。……小海从梦里惊醒过来，发现雪花穿过门缝，已经在他的脚上厚厚地落了一层。门外，是一片银色的世界了。
    “下雪了！”小海高兴得跳了起来，“妈，你看罗，下雪了，好大的雪呀！”
    妈妈应了一声：“晓得了。”
    “明天又是莲溪的墟，我挑炭到镇上卖去，一定能卖出个好价钱。”
    “快睡吧，三三。”
    小海兴奋得再也睡不着了。他把扁担、箩筐收拾了一下，对自己说：“明天，我要挑四十斤，不怕，多歇几次总能挑到墟上去的。”看看天色，还早得很哩。他又回到草堆里躺下，搂了一大堆柴草严严实实地把脚盖住。冷风透过墙缝直往身上钻，冻得小海上下牙不停地磕碰着。他心里还在说：“下吧，下吧！不下大点，我爹还不起账呵！下得越大越好，越大越……”渐渐地，他又回到了梦里。……
    莲溪镇上，小海挑着那担炭来回叫了十几趟，没有人应他。年三十了，店铺都上了板，门上贴着些骑着麒麟、拿着宝剑的门神；冷风中，几张没有粘牢的写着“生意兴隆通四海”“财源茂盛达三江”的对联在晃动。刘家大屋院子里，狗崽子们已经开始放鞭炮玩了。小海觉得肩上的担子越来越重，连那一对逗人的石头狮子，他也懒得看了。
    街口菜市上，还有几个老头，提着烘篮在那儿守摊子。一个老头喊了一声，小海飞快地跑过去。
    “伢子，买两块糯米糍粑回去过年罗。”
    小海一听，没有理他，回头就走。
    “来来来，买条鱼吧，新鲜的！”另一个老头喊着。
    “鱼！”小海挑着炭走到跟前看了又看，他半张着小嘴还是恋恋不舍地走了。
    小海在街上走着。忽然，他想起了铁匠师傅，便加快步子朝铁匠炉走去。心想：“我这担炭好，师傅一定会要的。”刚刚拐弯，远远看见铁匠炉门口围满了人，一根黄颜色的文明棍在人群里乱晃。
    “走呵走呵！这有么事好看的？‘杀人抵命，欠债还钱’，这是老规矩。”保长咋呼着说，“他李铁匠欠刘家的钱也不是一天两天，他爷爷的老账到现在都没还清。今天大年三十，哪家不等着钱开销？刘老爷是看在街坊们的面上，只封了他的店，哼！要不然早就送官啦！”
    小海挤进人堆，看见一个保丁正把两张封条十字交叉地贴在门上，白纸黑字上边扣着两个血红的大印。他望着封条，不知道出了什么事。
    人都走了。小海发现门边上还坐着一个人：弯着腰，低着头，身上只穿着一套单褂裤。
    “师傅？！……”
    铁匠师傅抬起头来说：“伢子，你是来烤火的？……来晚了！这些，”他往身背后指了指，“这些都是别个的啦！是他姓刘的啦！”
    “师傅，”小海似乎明白过来了，“不。我，我是给你送炭来的……”
    铁匠惨然一笑：“我没得钱，只剩下这一身单褂裤，任什么都没有了！”
    小海想起了红通通的炉火，想起了铁匠师傅给的热呼呼的红薯。多少个下雪天，这里，曾经是他出门来唯一可得到温暖的地方。如今，连歇脚的地方也没有了。他难过地说：
    “我，我不要钱。我会砍柴，我会跟爹爹烧炭了。”
    “伢子，难为你这片心。快把炭卖了回家去吧，你爹爹在等你。去吧，啊？”
    小海离开了铁匠师傅，觉得两条腿更重了，好不容易才挪回到菜市边上。他一个人蹲在那里，封条上的两颗血红大印总在脑子里打转转。
    天色渐渐地暗下来了。店铺里传来猜拳行令的叫声，是吃团圆饭的时候了，小海眼巴巴地还在菜市上守着。
    “伢子，你还没走！”卖糍粑的老头从这儿路过，同情地说，“回去过年罗。有钱人家，腊月二十四就办齐了年货；没得钱的，今天哪有心思买炭烤火呵！”
    另一个人也说：“过了初五再来，这几天没有买卖。”
    小海想：“不早了，妈妈该等得着急了，回去算啦……”他挑起了炭，仿佛又看见爹爹愁眉苦脸的样子；那两张扣着血红大印的封条也在眼前转动起来。
    “我要不卖几个钱，我怎能回去呢？”想到这个，他拦住了那几个老头说：“老人家，行行好，把我这担炭买回去烤火吧。我爹爹等着钱还账。”
    老头苦笑着说：“我要是不该账，今天也不会出来坐冷板凳呵。”
    小海央求着：“买罗，我便宜点。”
    卖糍粑的老头放下挑子说：“伢子，火我是烤不起，我是看你可怜。唉！你留半边炭给我，换几块糍粑回去。”
    “不，糍粑我们吃不起。”
    卖鱼的也走过来说：“好事做到底，你把那半边炭给我，提两条鱼回去。好歹也算过个年。”
    鱼！昨天晚上梦里边还抓鱼哩。看见鱼，小海好象又看见妈妈微微抽动着的嘴角，耳边又响起了四妹子嘶哑的哭声……他下了个狠心：
    “好，我只要得起一条小鱼、一块糍粑。你们做做好事，给我几个现钱吧。我爹他……”
    老头们相互看了看，光叹气没有说什么，大家凑了几个钱给小海。卖糍粑的老头拿起两块糍粑塞到小海手里。
    “伢子，你……早点回去吧！”
    小海转身要走，另一个老头喊住了他：
    “等等，伢子，你……你再拣两条鱼回去！”
    小海感激地望着他们，含着眼泪拣了两条最小的鱼。
    小海告别了老人们往回走，他在想：“鱼和糍粑都给妈妈吃吧，只要妈妈有了奶，四妹子就不会再哭了。可怜四妹子整一岁了，我就没见她笑过。……”突然，他远远看见刘家大屋门前的那对石头狮子正呲牙咧嘴地瞪着他。小海一声尖叫：“哎呀，该不会碰见刘大斗吧！他会把鱼和糍粑都抢去的。不行！”一想到这，小海急忙拐进了一条窄巷子，把东西都藏在怀里，系好腰带，这才放心地奔回家去。
    天全黑了，小海才赶到山上。远远看见玉英姐姐打着火把守在山口，在等他回来。
    屋里静悄悄的，灯也没有点。四妹子在床上躺着，大概是睡着了；爹爹捏着那几张不知道数过多少遍的金圆券，木呆呆地坐在火塘旁边；妈妈伤心伤意地在掉眼泪。小海进门就喊：
    “爹，这是卖炭的钱。”
    爹爹接过钱去点了点数，两道眉毛紧紧锁在一起。他忽地一下站起身来：
    “就这几个钱？”
    小海看见爹爹铁青的脸，一下竟楞住了。
    爹爹一把揪住小海：“说，你买么事吃了？”
    小海有口难辩：“我，我……”
    爹爹脸上的肌肉可怕地抽搐着：“你不晓得家里等钱用呵，你不晓得家里在等钱还账呵？”他一边说一边跺着脚，“我，我……我打死你这个馋嘴的！”他把小海推倒在地上，顺手抄起一根棍子。
    妈妈赶过来护住小海：“他爹，利钱横竖是凑不齐了，三三一年到头没有吃过一顿饱饭，今天过年，你，你就饶他这一回吧！”
    姐姐拦住爹爹喊着：“爹！要打，你打我吧！三三小，他还不懂事……”
    “说！钱到哪里去了？不说实话，看老子今天怎么收拾你！”
    小海忍住眼泪，慢慢从地上爬起来：“炭没人要，我看四妹子饿得作孽，妈妈又没有奶，……我就拿炭换回来一点吃的。”说着他解开腰带，从怀里掏出两条小鱼和糍粑，战战兢兢地捧到爹爹跟前。
    看见小海手上的鱼，全家都呆住了。爹爹好象站不稳似的，晃晃悠悠朝后退了几步，棍子从他手上掉了下来，金圆券也散落一地。他呆呆痴痴地楞在那里，过了好一会儿，才抢上两步，一把把小海搂在胸前，嘴唇上下乱抖，半天说不出话来。是啊，小海什么时候馋过嘴呀，还不是为了那可怜的四丫头！
    “爹委屈你了！儿呵，我……”恒文东张西望，好象在找什么。忽然，他捏紧了拳头，狠狠地捶打着自己的胸口。他一边打，一边嚎着：
    “我糊涂！我糊涂呵！……”
    这一拳一拳就象打在全家人的心上。
    “三三，你不晓得爹爹的难处呵！南坡上的那五分地……没有啦！”恒文指着小海手上的糍粑说，“这些东西，不是我们吃的！”
    “我晓得，爹爹！”小海额头上一阵冰凉，爹爹的眼泪正一滴滴地掉在他脸上。
    望着糍粑，望着鱼，全家想起了坡上的那五分地。姐姐在一边偷偷地哭着；妈妈倒抽着凉气，扑倒在床脚边。……
    爹爹抬起了头，说：“地是保不住了，保不住了！盼只盼嵩伢子早点回来，我们一家人能平平安安地活着。”
    两块糍粑，正好一人半块，这也叫一顿“团圆饭”；煨好的鱼汤，清清淡淡只有一碗，姐姐端着送到妈妈的手边。
    “妈，你喝了吧。”
    “三三，过来！你先喝两口。”妈妈喊着。
    小海没有动。
    “过来呀！”妈妈还在喊。
    爹爹说话了：“叫你喝，你就趁热喝下去。”
    妈妈几次把碗送到嘴边，张了张嘴又把碗放下来。这碗鱼汤她怎么能咽得下去呵！她一边揉着心口一边说：
    “英妹子，把碗端过去，我，我这里哽得慌。”
    “妈，喝吧，四妹子等着吃奶哩！”姐姐把鱼汤送到妈妈手上，转身抱起床里边的四妹子。
    “是呵，该喂奶了。”妈妈在想，“人家岁把的伢子早就满地乱跑了，可四妹子连坐都还坐不稳。”她鼓起勇气把碗又送到嘴边。
    突然，姐姐一声尖叫：
    “妈！你看，四妹子她……她……”
    “啊！”妈妈一惊，乓的一声碗摔碎了。她连忙从玉英手上接过四妹子……
    小屋里一阵忙乱。活了岁把的四妹子，全身已经冰凉冰凉的了。……
    劳累了几天的小海，抓着半块糍粑靠在火塘边上睡着了。梦里边，他正在为四妹子抓鱼哩。一条条活蹦乱跳的鱼，在他眼前游动着。他微微张开小嘴，流露出一丝淡淡的笑意。他还不知道，他可怜的四妹子，已经永远不需要鱼汤，永远不需要奶了。
    茅屋里传出一片哭声，一家人为早死的四妹子，为失去的那五分向阳坡地，为这数不清的灾难哭泣着。
    雪下得更大了。一片片鹅毛大雪，翻卷着、盘旋着，不声不响地扑向山区，扑向老鸦窝，扑向欧阳海家那间挡不住风雪的小茅屋。寒冷、饥饿、死亡，就象走马灯似的在山区人民面前，转了一遍又一遍。一年又一年呵，人们用眼泪迎接新生的孩子，又用眼泪送走早逝的婴儿；一个又一个呵，孩子们空着肚子从娘胎里出来，又空着肚子离开人间……这杀人的旧社会，什么时候才坍塌崩溃；苦难的中国人民呵，哪一天才能重见晴天！
    更声传来，交子时了。远处响起了鞭炮声，是送故迎新的时刻了：旧的一年不声不响地过去了；新的一岁已经开始。
    门前的松树，悄悄地又增加了一圈年轮。　（未完待续）（附图片）

    小海卖完炭，告别卖鱼和卖糍粑的两位老人往家走。
    小海飞起一脚，把地主小崽子踢倒在地上。
