    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 1st – The Radio of the Voice of Laos has broadcast commentaries and audience reactions for several days, warmly praising the Chinese Yunnan Acrobatic Troupe's visit and performances in the Lao liberated area of Xiangkhouang, bringing Mao Zedong Thought and the profound friendship of 650 million Chinese people to the patriotic military and civilians of the Lao liberated area who are fighting.

    The radio station reported that officers and soldiers of the Lao People's Liberation Army said after watching the performance that every program performed by the Chinese Yunnan Acrobatic Troupe reflected the unparalleled heroism and firm determination of the Chinese people and army, under the teaching of Chairman Mao Zedong, to carry the revolution through to the end, illuminating all of our hearts with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    Cadres and soldiers of the patriotic neutral forces said that just as we are engaged in arduous and fierce struggle with U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, Chinese brothers from afar overcame numerous difficulties and came to our liberated area to perform, making us feel as if 650 million Chinese friends are standing by our side, greatly encouraging and enhancing our confidence in the struggle.

    The report said that after watching the performance of the Yunnan Acrobatic Troupe, the soldiers guarding Phou Khout Mountain were filled with confidence in winning victory for the motherland and the people, firmly grasped the guns in their hands, and guarded the steel positions of self-defense.

    A recent commentary published by the Radio of the Voice of Laos said that at the moment when the Lao military and civilians are engaged in arduous struggle with U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the Chinese Yunnan Acrobatic Troupe's visit and performance in the Xiangkhouang liberated area not only brings the deep friendship of the Chinese people to the Lao people, but also gives the Lao people the opportunity to learn from the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle experience and self-reliance spirit.

    The editorial emphasized that the people of Laos and China sympathize with and support each other in order to oppose U.S. imperialism, further developing the friendship that has existed between our two countries since ancient times. This friendship cannot be destroyed by any enemy.
