Editor's Note: Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out nearly twenty years ago: "The various irreconcilable contradictions at home and abroad are like a volcano, threatening American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on this volcano." Today, this volcano threatens US imperialism a hundred times more seriously. The domestic and foreign contradictions of US imperialism have never been as acute as they are today. Domestically, class contradictions and contradictions within the ruling group are intensifying; abroad, the contradictions between US imperialism and the people of all countries, as well as the contradictions between imperialist countries, are also intensifying. All these contradictions are interconnected and mutually influential. As domestic class contradictions in the United States deepen, US imperialism will intensify its external expansion, thereby deepening its contradictions with the people of all countries and its contradictions with other imperialist countries. US imperialism's external expansion and aggression are bound to be resisted by the people of all countries, and will also arouse resistance from other imperialist countries. Its repeated setbacks will inevitably deepen domestic class contradictions and contradictions within the ruling group in the United States. Currently, US imperialism is in an unprecedentedly difficult situation.

The war of aggression against Vietnam is a major factor causing US imperialism to be beset with internal and external difficulties, and it is accelerating the development of contradictions at home and abroad in US imperialism. US imperialism is in a terrible mess on the South Vietnamese battlefield and has reached a dead end; at home, the movement of the American people against the war of aggression against Vietnam is rising, and there are constant disputes within the US ruling group over the policy of aggression against Vietnam. It is certain that if US imperialism continues to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, its internal and external difficulties will inevitably become more and more serious.

Johnson Administration Besieged Internally and Externally, Isolated and Abandoned
American Magazine Exclaims Heavy Domestic Crisis, "Trouble" Everywhere in the World, Washington Exhausted

(Our Dispatch) Due to the failure of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the deterioration of the domestic economy, and the disintegration of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, the Johnson administration is increasingly trapped in a situation of being abandoned and isolated, reaching a dead end. The "U.S. News & World Report" magazine published on June 6 sketched Johnson's internal and external difficulties and difficult days.

An article published in "U.S. News & World Report" wrote that "Everything is changing for Johnson." Johnson constantly "encounters obstacles, setbacks, and regressions. Mr. Johnson is finding that as soon as trouble occurs, trouble can quickly accumulate." For Johnson, "everywhere are worrying and mind-boggling things, and it seems that few things are going according to plan, and many things have gone wrong."

"U.S. News & World Report" pointed out that the failure of the war of aggression against Vietnam is Johnson's most "distressing" problem, "The war has changed from a minor event to the President's top priority, and the same is true for the government." "Most of the President's distress seems to be due to the war and the frustrations of the war." Although the United States has repeatedly increased its troops in South Vietnam and frantically bombed North Vietnam, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces have "strengthened, and the situation in South Vietnam is even more tense."

Johnson has repeatedly boasted about the "Great Society" at home, and has vigorously promoted the so-called "War on Poverty" program to win people's hearts.

However, this American magazine admitted, "The real war suddenly seems to be more important than the exaggerated 'War on Poverty'." "There is less and less talk about the 'Great Society'." "Inflation, how to control prices and not let them rise too fiercely... has replaced the 'Great Society' as the urgent task of policy planners and speechwriters."

The "U.S. News & World Report" article believes that there is also a touch-and-go situation in the American black people's struggle, "Many black leaders warn that among many blacks who believe that Johnson's plan has not brought them equality and prosperity, there is a mood of riots."

When talking about the international status of the United States, the article said, "In most parts of the world, the United States is encountering widespread trouble." "In Europe, the Western European alliance, which has always seemed very solid, is disintegrating. French General de Gaulle used to seem at most to be an annoying figure. Suddenly, he is seen as a danger."

The article believes that Johnson once thought he "found a magic formula for making the president's job successful." This formula is the so-called "consensus." Now, "this formula is not working at home and abroad," and even the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "which usually gave the President comfort and help when the US government encountered difficulties abroad," "has been busy adding trouble (to Johnson) rather than reducing trouble." Some members of this committee showed "tendencies to be divided."

The article also lamented that Johnson was once considered "a powerful figure in the White House," "but now this image has obviously changed greatly." (with picture)

### 约翰逊政府内外交困众叛亲离  美刊惊呼国内危机重重，世界处处“麻烦”，华盛顿伤透脑筋

专栏：

    编者按：毛泽东同志在将近二十年前就曾经指出：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”今天，这一座火山更是百倍严重地威胁着美帝国主义。美帝国主义国内外的矛盾，从来没有象今天这样尖锐。在国内，阶级矛盾和统治集团内部矛盾日益加剧；在国外，美帝国主义同各国人民的矛盾和帝国主义国家之间的矛盾也是日益加剧。所有这些矛盾都是互相联系、互相影响的。美国国内阶级矛盾加深，美帝国主义就要加紧向外扩张，从而加深它同各国人民之间的矛盾以及它同其他帝国主义国家的矛盾。美帝国主义对外扩张和侵略，必然遭到各国人民的反抗，同时也要引起其他帝国主义国家的抗拒，它到处碰壁，就不能不反过来加深美国国内阶级矛盾和统治集团内部矛盾。目前，美帝国主义正处于空前未有的困难境地。
    侵越战争是造成美帝国主义内外交困的一个主要因素，它在加速着美帝国主义国内外矛盾的发展。美帝国主义在南越战场上弄得焦头烂额，走投无路；在国内美国人民反对侵越战争的运动日益高涨，美国统治集团内部在侵越政策上争吵不断。可以肯定，美帝国主义继续扩大侵越战争，它的内外交困的局面就必然要越来越严重。
    约翰逊政府内外交困众叛亲离
    美刊惊呼国内危机重重，世界处处“麻烦”，华盛顿伤透脑筋
    本报讯　由于侵越战争失利、国内经济恶化、北大西洋侵略集团分崩离析，约翰逊政府日益陷入众叛亲离、走投无路的境地。六月六日出版的《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志勾画了约翰逊的这种内外交困、日子难过的情况。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》刊载的一篇文章写道，“对约翰逊说来，一切都正在发生变化”。约翰逊不断“遇到障碍、挫折和倒退。约翰逊先生正在发现，只要一发生麻烦，麻烦就能够很快地积累起来”，对约翰逊说来，“到处是令人担心和伤脑筋的事，看来很少事情是按照计划进行的，许多事情出了岔子”。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》指出，侵越战争的失利，是约翰逊最为“苦恼”的问题，“战争从一个次要事件变成总统的当务之急，对政府说来也是这样”，“总统的苦恼看来大部分是出于战争和战争的挫折”。尽管美国一再增兵南越和疯狂轰炸越南北方，但是南越人民武装力量却“加强了，南越局面更为紧张”。
    约翰逊曾经在国内一再吹嘘“伟大的社会”，大吹大擂地推行所谓“向贫困宣战”计划，以笼络人心。
    但是，这家美国杂志承认，“真实的战争突然似乎变得比夸张的‘向贫困宣战’重要得多”，“关于‘伟大的社会’的谈论愈来愈少了”。“通货膨胀、如何控制物价不让它涨得太凶……代替了‘伟大的社会’成为政策计划者和演说撰稿人的迫切任务”。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》的文章认为，美国黑人斗争也存在着一触即发的形势，“许多黑人领袖警告说，在认为约翰逊的计划并没有给他们带来平等和繁荣的许多黑人中间，存在着暴乱情绪”。
    文章在谈到美国的国际地位时说，“在世界大部分地区，美国遭到普遍的麻烦”，“在欧洲，一向看来十分巩固的西欧联盟正在瓦解。法国的戴高乐将军过去好象至多不过是一个惹人生气的人物。突然间，他被看成是一种危险了”。
    文章认为，约翰逊曾经以为他“找到了一个使总统工作成功的魔术公式”。这个公式就是所谓“意见一致”。现在，“这个公式在国内外都不灵了”，甚至“在过去当美国政府在国外遭到困难时，通常给总统以慰藉和帮忙的”参议院外交委员会“也一直忙于（给约翰逊）增添麻烦，而不是减少麻烦”。这个委员会的一些委员出现了“四分五裂的倾向”。
    文章还哀叹道，约翰逊曾经被认为“是白宫的一个强有力的人物”，“但是现在这个形象显然已经大大改变了”。（附图片）
