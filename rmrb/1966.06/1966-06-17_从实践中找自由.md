    Seeking Freedom Through Practice
　　Harbin Xinfeng Processing Factory Worker Technician　Shen Guangen
    Since 1956, I have been involved in more than 300 technical innovations, large and small. Previously, because the purpose was not clear and the methods were not right, I succeeded less often and failed more often. Since studying Chairman Mao's works, especially his philosophical works, I have become increasingly clear-headed, more daring, and more resourceful in the practice of technical innovation. Therefore, I have succeeded more often and failed less often than before. Ten years of technical innovation practice have made me deeply realize that to rapidly change our country's poor and blank state, technical innovation is essential; to carry out technical innovation well, communist consciousness and correct thinking methods are essential; to have communist consciousness and correct thinking methods, studying Chairman Mao's works is essential. Mao Zedong Thought is not only a sharp weapon guiding us in class struggle, but also a magic weapon guiding us in transforming nature.
                  Technical Innovation Involves Politics
    Before Liberation, my family was very poor. I entered a factory as an apprentice at the age of fourteen and suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression. At that time, I thought that to keep my job, I had to learn a good skill. If the master didn't teach, I would secretly watch and practice. In this way, I finally learned some skills. Later, I worked independently. To save effort, finish the work faster, and earn more money, I tried to improve a set of welding equipment. The regulation was to weld fifteen phonographs a day, but I could weld more than seventy. I regarded this innovation as my secret weapon and didn't tell anyone. Later, I wanted to improve the universal oil pump operating table again, but I broke two drill bits by accident. The boss beat me so badly that I couldn't even crawl. From then on, I never wanted to think of new ideas again.
    After Liberation, our working class stood up. In 1954, I responded to the Party's call and went to the Northeast to participate in socialist construction. At that time, I was particularly happy to see the newly built factories stretching into a continuous area. I was wholeheartedly thinking of working harder and contributing more to socialist construction. Once, I helped construction workers carry pebbles, and my shoulders became swollen after working for a few days. I thought, not only am I tired, but everyone else is also very tired. Wouldn't it be great if I could think of a way to save effort and produce more? With the support of the Party, I imitated an overhead cableway and created a set of earth-transporting trolleys. As a result, not only were the shoulders of the worker brothers no longer burdened, but also the labor efficiency was greatly improved. Another time, several imported belt conveyors were installed without protective covers. I thought of my father working for capitalists in the old society, who had two fingers cut off by a power saw due to the lack of safety equipment. Now it is a new society, and the workers have become the masters of the country. We have a responsibility to protect our class brothers. I took the initiative to make a few protective covers and installed them. Through these two things, I thought that to build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, we cannot only rely on brute force; we must also rely on using our brains and thinking of tricks. From then on, I was particularly enthusiastic about proposing rationalization suggestions and carried out some technical innovations, which were praised by the leadership several times. At this time, problems began to appear in my thinking. I thought that technical innovation was really beneficial to both the public and the private sectors. I could contribute to the country, get bonuses, and earn a good reputation. Thinking of these things, I felt very happy. From then on, I became a bit picky about technical innovation. I was particularly enthusiastic about projects with big benefits, but I was unwilling to do projects with small benefits. Once, the coal gas generator pulverizer had an accident. I saw many places that could be improved and wanted to help improve them. But I was afraid that if I did it badly, I would lose the team's red flag, so I didn't improve it.
    In 1960, I was hospitalized due to illness. Lying in bed, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and summarized my past technical innovations while studying, which made me think about many issues. At this time, I realized that technical innovation involves politics. Technical innovation is done by people, and people are controlled by ideas. If the political awareness is high, technical achievements can be improved more quickly. Recalling the years I had gone through on the road of technical innovation, I realized that whenever the idea of serving the people prevailed, there were more successes; whenever individualism emerged, there were fewer successes. Thinking of the detours I had taken, I felt very sad. I thought to myself: Norman Bethune was a foreigner who came to China from afar to help the revolution. If he had thought of personal fame and gain, he would not have come. I was doing something for my own country, but I still put personal interests first. I really shouldn't have done that. I also thought that without the leadership of the Party and the help of the masses, what achievements could I, a young worker who had only studied for two years in the old society, have made? I should pursue the fame and interests of the class, the country, and socialism, and should not make petty calculations of individualism. From then on, I made up my mind to strive to be a noble person like Zhang Side and Norman Bethune.
                Both Boldness and Prudence are Necessary
    In the past, when I engaged in technical innovation, I always had to overcome the "fear" hurdle. Things like lack of information, lack of understanding, too complex, and the risk of losing money if it failed. Anyway, there were many things to fear. Some problems were feared before I even started. Once, I was preparing to reform a gas heater. I heard that it could explode if it was not handled properly, so I gave up. After studying Chairman Mao's philosophical works, I realized that the reason why I sometimes didn't dare to do things was mainly because I didn't understand the laws of that thing and had no confidence. But things are inanimate, and people are animate. No matter how complex things are, as long as we respect science, dare to take the lead, and clear the way with action, people will recognize and master their laws sooner or later. Thinking this way, there was nothing I didn't dare to do. In this regard, the thing that has given me the deepest experience is the new technology of oxygen-enriched smelting.
    Last February, the factory director asked us if we could engage in oxygen-enriched smelting? I thought, this is a big project. There has always been an unwritten rule that a technical innovation in mechanical processing can double efficiency. However, due to various limitations, it is not easy to greatly increase efficiency in smelting. If we could find a new way to increase production without increasing investment, how significant that would be! Thinking of this, I felt a surge of energy. I said, "With the leadership of the Party, we dare to do it." However, I didn't know how to do it exactly. I had never seen it in books, nor had I heard that foreigners had done it, so I had no confidence. Therefore, I first went to consult the production workers. Some said, "This is terrible. Too much oxygen could cause an explosion." I also went to consult the technical personnel. They said, "We haven't heard of using oxygen-enriched smelting for this kind of metal!" Hearing these things, I was also shocked. Could this thing be done? First, there was no ready-made information to refer to. Second, there was the danger of explosion. It was really difficult to touch the "tiger's" butt without understanding its temper. Therefore, for two months, I just went around in circles on the design documents and didn't dare to actually do anything.
    Later, I thought carefully about it. The reason why I didn't dare to be bold was that "boxes" had "boxed" me in. Just because others haven't done it doesn't mean we can't do it. Roads are made by people. If we don't go, then we can only follow behind others forever. Old technology must be replaced by new technology. Why can't we find our own way? In addition, I thought that everything has two sides. The statement about explosion only saw one side of the matter, but not the possibility of no explosion. Innovation always carries a certain degree of "risk." Otherwise, how could it be considered a revolution? Since we recognized the possibility of explosion, it would prompt us to actively find ways to prevent explosion. We cannot give up eating for fear of choking. As long as we master the laws, we can prevent it from exploding. If we don't master the laws, it may explode. In this way, we decided to be bold, but we couldn't be reckless. Strategically, we had to "dare" to take the lead, but tactically, we had to act carefully and prudently.
    We organized an experimental group and invited expert welders, production workers, and technical personnel. We held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" to carefully study the experimental plan, list all the worst possibilities, and correspondingly formulate various measures to deal with them. After more than three months of experiments, we finally found the key to this new technology and could control it to prevent explosion. After technical appraisal, compared with the past smelting method, oxygen-enriched smelting had no difference in quality, and the melting efficiency was greatly improved, increasing 1.5 times in small furnace experiments and 27% to 43% in large furnace experiments.
                  Seeking Freedom Through Practice
    The process of technical innovation, from beginning to end, is the process of resolving the contradiction between knowing and not knowing. How can we go from not knowing to knowing? I have learned that one is to learn from the experience of others, including knowledge in books; the other is to practice ourselves, and personal practice is the most important.
    In 1963, the factory director entrusted us with the task of trial-producing a new product. After careful inquiry, I learned that this was a product with which modern revisionism was trying to strangle us. Thinking of the bad things that modern revisionism had done, I was filled with anger. I thought that although I couldn't write articles, I would oppose modern revisionism with the practical action of technological innovation. So, I took on the task.
    However, there were no data, no technology, no special equipment, and the need was very urgent, which was really difficult. I ran around many places to find reference materials, flipped through books, consulted professors and experts, and looked at relevant equipment, trying to collect the experience of others as much as possible, even if it was just a little bit. But after searching around, I couldn't find anything really useful. At this time, someone said: "If you can't do it, suggest buying it from capitalist countries as soon as possible! Don't delay the matter!" I thought that we shouldn't say such discouraging words. It is normal to have no information. If we had everything, what would we do with technical innovation? Changing our country's poor and blank state depends on our own efforts. Things are done by people. Foreign countries didn't have information at the beginning either. If they can do it, we can do it too. Without information, there are no restrictions, and we can do it more freely. Freedom is the recognition of objective laws. To obtain freedom, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and go to practice to find the laws of things. For example, in order to solve a technological data and find the most suitable speed, we experimented for a long time without success. Sometimes we failed more than seventy times in one night. The critical technological data is precisely what the revisionists didn't tell us. I thought, the revisionists can strangle dead data, but they can't strangle the wisdom of the Chinese people. If you don't tell us, we will explore it bit by bit in practice, and we will always uncover this secret. Therefore, we gradually increased the speed from the intermediate speed to the maximum speed. If it didn't work upwards, we would try downwards. We also tried it all the way down to the minimum speed. Finally, we found the most suitable speed.
    After the speed problem was solved, the smoothness of the product still did not meet the requirements. We tried for more than twenty days and couldn't find the reason for the failure. At this time, two views emerged. One view was to look through books and explore the theory to find the ready-made experience of others. The other view was to look at more similar equipment and find solutions in practical work. I thought that we should of course look through the books, and it would be better if we could find them. But since this is a new thing in our country, and foreign countries are blockading us, the books may not have it. But we can find solutions everywhere in practice. After discussion, our understanding was unified, and we went to break through in practice separately. Later, I associated it with the rice mill, which is similar to our working principle. Could we see something from it? I went to the farm to take a look, discovered the problem, and asked the farm workers for advice. I was greatly inspired. When we came back, we researched and improved, and the smoothness completely met the requirements.
    The last step was the heating step. What is the appropriate heating temperature? It is said that there is a foreign data. We built an earthen stove for experiments. After the experiment, this data was not working at all. I thought that the temperature is different in the south and the north, and the temperature in the same place is also very different in winter and summer. The heating temperature must be affected by the climate, so the foreign data may not be applicable here. Chairman Mao formulated a complete set of strategies and tactics for the Chinese revolution based on the special conditions of China, and led the Chinese people to victory. We must also proceed from the time, place, and conditions when we engage in technological innovation. So I advocated changing the temperature. Some people questioned whether this was disrespectful to science? I felt that science should of course be respected, but science is also summed up from practice. The most reliable thing is practice. I believe in practice. No matter how many degrees it is, we'll count it if we make it. After repeated experiments, we finally found the appropriate temperature.
    In this way, we trial-produced this complex product on schedule. Not only did we guarantee the urgent needs, but also designed and manufactured a tens of meters long automated equipment based on a series of data we had mastered. In the past, importing one such product from abroad would cost tens of thousands of yuan, but now we can produce it ourselves.
    After the successful trial production of this product, some comrades felt very strange. After thinking about it carefully, I felt that there was nothing strange about it. The theory in books also comes from practice. Our method also comes from practice. As long as we resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "indigenous methods" can also solve cutting-edge technical problems.
            Failure Often Means Closer to Success
    The most frequent things encountered in technological innovation are difficulties and failures. It can be said that we deal with difficulties and failures from morning to night. For example, the trial production of one product failed 248 times, and another failed 116 times. Before studying Chairman Mao's works, I was always a little afraid of difficulties and failures, and even avoided and bowed down. After studying Chairman Mao's philosophical works, my attitude was very different from before. When I was working on the pipe cutting machine, the main parts such as the cutting disc were successfully tested, and it worked very well when tested manually. At this time, it could be used just by installing a motor. Facing the imminent success, I was very happy. I quickly designed a set of systems driven by belts, thinking that this method was feasible. However, as soon as the experiment was done, there was a problem. The motor vibrated violently when it turned on. Several people went up and held it down with bars, and the other end of the bars was also on the thick heating pipes. After the machine was turned on for a while, people were thrown up as high as if they were riding horses. Finally, it became a complete mess, and everyone in the room was scared. Production workers heard the noise and surrounded the door to watch. Someone said: "We dare not use such a machine. Who dares to get close to it when it is placed on the equipment?" At this time, I thought, I finally passed ninety-nine curves, and only this small ditch was overturned! If this level cannot be passed, the previous efforts will be in vain. I didn't know if I could continue, and I felt really uncomfortable. When I went back at night, I tossed and turned for half the night and couldn't fall asleep. I thought, our revolutionary predecessors made revolution, and they could withstand it in the most difficult times. They struggled, failed, then struggled again, failed again, and struggled again until the final victory. It is the same with us in technological innovation. If there are difficulties, it means that the contradiction has emerged; the greater the difficulty, the closer we are to solving the contradiction. Thinking this way, I felt energized again. I got up and re-studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice." Chairman Mao told us that if the subjective knowledge does not conform to the objective laws, it will fail in practice. After many failures, we can correct the wrong understanding and achieve the unity of the subjective and the objective. These words inspired me greatly. I repeatedly thought about the reasons for the failure. It was because the motor drove the belt, and the belt drove the cutting disc. The belt would slip if it was loose, and it would vibrate if it was tight. The cutting disc had to move back and forth and could not be fixed too tightly. How could it not crash? Thinking about this, we came up with a plan to use a hollow motor to directly drive the movement of the cutting disc. Our experimental group also repeatedly studied and found a waste motor to hollow out for experiments. But as soon as it ran, the motor heated up. Electrician Liu Qiming reminded us that there might be something wrong with the quality of the motor itself. We also used motors of the same type and from the same factory to experiment, and found that it heated up even if it was not hollowed out. This proved that heating up did not necessarily have a necessary connection with hollowing out. Later, we replaced it with a better quality motor, hollowed it out and tried again. As a result, the operation was completely normal, breaking through this difficult pass. Through this incident, I further realized that failure is often the precursor to success. Every failure is a step towards success. Every time we fail, we gain a little knowledge, and the hope of success becomes greater. If a hundred roads are blocked, the remaining one is success. Because people's understanding is constantly improved in repeated failures, the ninety-ninth failure will be very different from the first failure. Therefore, after many failures, it is possible to force out more advanced things. If our belt drive can be used reluctantly, we would not have made the hollow motor, a more advanced thing. In technological innovation, we should try our best to avoid unnecessary failures; but it doesn't matter if we fail. The important thing is not failure, but not letting failure slip away easily. We must examine the "military situation" like grabbing a "prisoner," ask it everything, and draw the necessary conclusions. In this way, we can turn failure into a precursor to success and turn the bad thing of failure into a good thing.

### 从实践中找自由

    从实践中找自由
　　哈尔滨新风加工厂工人技术员　沈关根
    从一九五六年到现在，我搞过三百多项大大小小的技术革新。以前，由于目的性不明确，方法不对头，搞成功的比较少，失败的比较多。自从学习毛主席著作，特别是学习毛主席的哲学著作以来，在技术革新的实践中，心里越来越亮堂，越来越敢干，越来越觉得有办法。因此，搞成功的也就比以前多一些，失败的比以前少一些。十年来的技术革新实践，使我深深体会到：要迅速改变我国一穷二白的面貌，不搞技术革新不行；要很好地搞技术革新，没有共产主义觉悟和正确的思想方法不行；要有共产主义觉悟和正确的思想方法，不学习毛主席著作不行。毛泽东思想不但是指导我们进行阶级斗争的尖锐武器，也是指导我们改造自然的法宝。
                  技术革新里面有政治
    解放前，我家里很穷。十四岁就进工厂学徒，受尽了剥削和压迫。那时我想，要保住饭碗，只有学得一手好手艺才行。师傅不教，就偷着看，偷着练，这样，总算学到了一点技术。以后，自己独立干活。为了省点劲，快一点把活干完，多挣点钱，就想办法改进了一套焊接器。焊电唱机，规定一天焊十五个，我能焊七十多个。我把这项革新当成自己的绝招，谁也不告诉。后来有一次，又想改进万能油泵手术床，不小心打了两根钻头，老板把我揍得爬都爬不起来，从此，我就再也不愿意想新点子了。
    解放后，我们工人阶级翻了身。一九五四年，响应党的号召，我到东北参加了社会主义建设。那时候，我看到新建的工厂连成了片，心里特别高兴，一心想多干活，多为社会主义建设出点力。有一次，我帮助土建工人挑石子，干了几天，肩膀压肿了。我想，不但我一个人累，大家也都很累，要是能想个办法，又省劲、又多出活，该有多好。在党的支持下，我仿照架空索道，搞了一套运土滑车。结果，不但工人弟兄的肩膀不再受累了，还大大提高了劳动效率。又有一次，安装几台国外进口的皮带运输机，没有保护罩。我想到父亲在旧社会给资本家干活，因为没有安全设备，被电锯锯坏了两个手指头。现在是新社会，工人成了国家的主人，有责任爱护自己的阶级弟兄。我就主动地做了几个保护罩安上了。通过这两件事，我想，要多快好省地建设社会主义，不能光靠笨力气，还得靠多动脑筋，多想窍门。从此以后，我提合理化建议的劲头特别足，搞了一些技术革新，受到领导上几次表扬。就在这个时候，我的思想上开始出了毛病。我想，搞技术革新真是公私两利，为国家出了力，还能得奖金，又落个好名声。想到这些，觉得心里美滋滋的。从此以后，再搞技术革新就有点挑挑拣拣，好处大的，劲头特别足；好处小的，就不愿意干了。有一次，煤气发生炉粉碎机出了事故，当时看到很多地方可以改进，想帮助改改。又怕万一弄不好，把小组的红旗弄飞了，就没有去改。
    一九六○年，我因病住了院。躺在病床上，反复学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，一边学习，一边对照总结过去的技术革新，使我想到了很多的问题。这时，我才明白了技术革新里面有政治。技术革新是人去搞的，人是受思想支配的。政治觉悟高，技术成就才能更快地提高。回想自己在技术革新道路上走过的几年，凡是为人民服务的思想占上风的时候，成功的就多；个人主义冒出来的时候，成功的就少。想到自己走过的弯路，感到很难过。自己心里想：白求恩是个外国人，不远万里来到中国帮助革命，他如果想个人的名利，就不会来了。我给自己的国家干点事情，还把个人摆进去，实在不应该。又想到，没有党的领导和群众的帮助，就凭我这个在旧社会只念过两年书的青年工人，能有什么成就？我应当追求阶级的名利、国家的名利和社会主义的名利，而不应当打个人主义的小算盘。从此以后，我就下定决心，要努力做个象张思德和白求恩那样高尚的人。
                既要大胆，又不能冒失
    过去搞技术革新，我都得先过“怕”字关，象没有资料啦，不懂啦，太复杂啦，搞不成要赔账啦，等等，反正怕的东西很多。有一些问题还没有动手就先怕起来了。有一次我准备改革一台煤气加热器，听说弄不好要爆炸，就撂了挑子。学习了毛主席哲学著作以后，我明白了所以有时不敢干，主要是因为对那件事情的规律不了解，没把握。但物是死的，人是活的，不管多么复杂的事物，只要尊重科学，敢字当头，干字开路，它的规律早晚总是会被人们认识和掌握的。这样一想，也就没有什么不敢干的事情了。在这一点上，使我体会最深的，要算是搞富氧熔炼新技术。
    去年二月，厂长问我们能不能搞富氧熔炼？我想，这可是个大项目。自来有个不成文的说法，认为机械加工方面搞一项革新可以成倍提高效率，但熔炼方面受各种条件的限制，大幅度提高效率是不容易的。如果我们找出一条新的道路来，不增加投资，就能多增产，那意义该有多大。想到这里，来了一股劲。我说：“有党的领导，我们就敢干。”但是，究竟怎么干法，书上没见过，也没听说外国搞过，心里没有底。于是我就先去请教生产工人，有的说：“这可了不得，氧气多了，弄不好要爆炸。”又去请教技术人员，他们说：“我们这种金属，用富氧熔炼，还没听说过！”听了这些，我也吓了一跳。这玩艺能搞吗？一来没有现成资料做参考，二来又冒出个爆炸危险，不懂“老虎”的脾气，要去摸“老虎”的屁股，可真是难上加难。因此，有两个月的时间，光在设计资料上打圈子，没敢实际动手。
    后来，我仔细一琢磨，不敢放开胆子干的原因，是“框框”把我“框”住了。别人没干，不等于我们也不能干，路是人走出来的，如果我们不去走，那我们就只能永远跟在人家屁股后头走。旧的技术总得要有新的技术来代替，为什么我们不能走出一条自己的道路呢？另外又想，任何事物都是一分为二的，爆炸的说法，只是看到事物的一面，却没有看到可能不爆炸的一面。革新总带三分“险”，否则怎么算革命呢？既然认识到了可能爆炸，就会促使我们主动地设法防止爆炸，不能因噎废食。只要我们掌握了规律就可以不让它爆炸，不掌握规律它就可能爆炸。这样我们便确定要放开胆子干，但又不能冒失。在战略上要“敢”字当头，在战术上要小心谨慎行事。
    我们组织了试验小组，请来了内行的水电焊工人、生产工人和技术人员，开了“诸葛亮会”，周密地研究了试验方案，摆出了各种最坏的可能性，相应地制定了各种对付它的措施。经过三个多月的试验，终于找出了这项新工艺的门道，可以控制它不爆炸。经过技术鉴定，富氧熔炼和过去的熔炼方法比较，质量没有差别，熔化效率提高很多，小炉试验提高一点五倍，大炉试验提高百分之二十七到百分之四十三。
                  从实践中去找自由
    技术革新的过程，从头到尾都是解决知和不知这个矛盾的过程。怎样才能从不知到知呢？我体会，一是学习别人的经验，包括书本上的知识；一是要自己亲身实践，而亲身实践又是主要的。
    一九六三年，厂长把一种新产品的试制任务交给了我们。我仔细一打听，原来这是现代修正主义掐我们脖子的产品。想到现代修正主义干的坏事，我的气就不打一处来。心想，我虽然不会写文章，但是我要以革新技术的实际行动来反对现代修正主义。所以，就把任务接下来了。
    但是，没有资料，没有工艺，没有专用设备，要的又很急，实在困难。我跑了许多地方找参考资料，翻书，请教教授、专家，看有关的设备，尽量收集别人的经验，那怕一点一滴也不放过。但是找来找去，没有找到真正有用的东西。这时候有人说：“如果不能搞，趁早建议到资本主义国家去买吧！可别误了事！”我想，我们不应当说这种不争气的话。没有资料是正常的，如果什么都有，还用我们搞技术革新干啥？改变我们国家一穷二白的面貌，得靠我们自己动手。事情是人干的，外国开始也没有资料，他们能干，我们也能干。没有资料，也就没有框框，干起来更能放手。自由是对客观规律的认识。要取得自由，就必须按照毛主席的教导，到实践中去摸事物的规律。譬如，为了解决一项工艺数据，找到最合适的转速，我们试验了很长时间，都没有成功。有时一宿就失败了七十多次。修正主义不告诉我们的，正是这些关键性的工艺数据。我想，修正主义可以掐住死的数据，却不可能把我们中国人民的智慧给掐住了，你不告诉我们，我们就在实践中一点一点摸索，总会把这个秘密揭开。因此，我们就从中间转速往上逐渐增加，一直试到最大转速；往上不行，就往下试。又一直试到最小转速。终于找到了一个最合适的转速。
    转速的问题解决了，产品的光洁度还达不到要求。试了二十多天，也找不到失败的原因。这时候就出来两种主张。一种主张是翻书本，从理论上探讨，找找别人的现成经验；另一种主张是多看一些相类似的设备，在实干中找办法。我觉得书本当然应该翻，能找出来更好。但是既然在我们国家是新东西，外国又封锁我们，书本上就不一定有。而从实践中找办法，到处都可能找到。经过讨论，我们的认识统一了，就分头到实践中去闯。后来我联想到碾米用的碾子，和我们的工作原理挺相似，是不是从那上面能看出点门道？我就跑到农场去看，发现了问题就向农场工人请教，果然得到很大启发。回来我们就研究改进，结果光洁度完全达到了要求。
    最后一道是加热关。加热多少度合适呢？据说外国有一个数据。我们盘了一个土炉子试验。经过试验，这个数据根本不行。我想到，南方和北方气温不同，同一地方冬天和夏天气温也差很多，加热温度一定要受气候影响，所以外国的数据在这里就不一定适用。毛主席根据中国的特殊条件，制定了一整套中国革命的战略战术，领导中国人民取得了胜利，我们搞技术革新也得从时间、地点、条件出发。所以我就主张改温度。有人怀疑这样做是不是不尊重科学？我觉得：科学当然要尊重，但是，科学也是从实践中总结出来的。最可靠的还是实践。我相信实践，不管多少度，搞出来算数。又经过反复试验，终于找到了合适的温度。
    就这样，我们按期把这项复杂产品试制出来了。不但保证了紧急需要，还根据掌握的一系列资料，设计制造了一种几十米长的自动化设备。过去从外国进口一个这种产品，要上万元钱，现在我们自己就可以生产了。
    这项产品试制成功以后，有的同志觉得很奇怪。我仔细一想，觉得并没有什么可奇怪的。书本上的理论，也是从实践中来的。我们的办法同样是从实践中来的。只要坚决按照毛主席的教导去做，“土办法”也能解决尖端的技术问题。
            失败，往往是离成功更近了
    搞技术革新，遇到最多的就是困难和失败，可以说一天从早到晚都是同困难和失败打交道。例如有一项产品的试制，失败了二百四十八次，另一项失败了一百一十六次。没学习毛主席著作以前，我对困难和失败总是有些怕，甚至躲避和低头。学习了毛主席的哲学著作以后，我的态度和以前就大不相同了。在搞切管机的时候，切割盘等主要部分都试验成功了，用手动试验，很好使。这时候，只剩下装上马达，就可以用了。面对着即将到来的成功，心里十分高兴。很快设计了用皮带传动的一套系统，原以为这个办法可行。但是，一做试验，就出了漏子。马达转起来，振动得厉害。上去几个人用杠子压住，杠子的另一头还顶在老粗的暖气管子上。机器开动了不一会，人都象骑马一样颠起老高，最后闹了个人仰马翻，满屋子的人都吓得够呛。生产工人听到动静，围在门口看。有人说：“这样的机器我们可不敢用，放在设备上，谁敢靠跟前？”这时我心想，好容易过了九十九道湾，只剩下这道小河沟还翻了船！如果这道关通不过，以前的心血就算白搭了。能不能搞下去，自己也没底，心里那个难过劲实在提不得。晚上回去，折腾了半宿没睡着。我想，我们革命前辈闹革命，在最困难的时候顶得住，斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直到最后胜利。我们搞技术革新也是一样，有了困难，说明矛盾露头了；困难越大，离着解决矛盾也就越近。这样一想，劲头又来了。爬起来重新学习了毛主席的《实践论》。毛主席告诉我们，如果主观认识不符合客观的规律性，在实践中就会失败。经过许多失败，才能纠正错误的认识，达到主观与客观的统一。这些话对我启发很大。我反复想了失败的原因，是因为电动机带动皮带，皮带又带动切割盘，皮带松了要打滑，紧了要振动，而切割盘是要来回运动的，不能固定得太死，这怎能不翻车呢？围绕着这点想来想去，我们想出了用空心马达直接带动切割盘运动的方案。我们试验小组也反复研究，找来一台废马达，自己掏空做试验。但是一运转，马达却发热了。电工刘启明提醒说，可能马达本身质量有毛病。我们又拿同类型号、同一工厂出品的马达做试验，发现不掏空也发热。这证明发热与掏空不一定有必然联系。后来换了一台质量好一点的马达掏空再试，结果运转完全正常，突破了这道难关。通过这件事，使我进一步体会到：失败往往是成功的先导。每一项失败，都是通向成功的一个阶梯，失败一次，增长一点见识，成功的希望越大。一百条道，堵死九十九条，剩下一条就是成功。由于人的认识在反复失败中不断地提高了，第九十九次失败，比第一次失败一定会大不相同。所以经过多次失败以后，也就可能逼出来更高级的东西。我们的皮带传动如果勉强可用，也就不会搞成空心马达这种更高级的东西了。在技术革新中，是要尽力避免不应有的失败；但失败了也不要紧。重要的问题并不在于失败，而是在于不要让失败轻易地溜过去，要象抓住“俘虏”一样，探探“军情”，问它个水落石出，得出来必要的结论。这样就可以把失败变为成功的先导，使失败这个坏事变成好事。
