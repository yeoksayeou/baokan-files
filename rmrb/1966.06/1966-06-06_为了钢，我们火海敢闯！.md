    For Steel, We Dare to Brave the Sea of Fire!
    Worker of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Zhang Shifang
    
    Drums of war thunder, red flags flutter, furnace fires rage, steel flowers bloom.
    In order to support key national construction,
    In order to forge national defense into an iron wall and copper fortress,
    In order to accelerate the pace of our motherland's progress,
    In order to support the liberation of the world's people,
    We steel warriors leap and bound,
    Tens of thousands of troops engage in a great battle beside the steelmaking furnace.
    We deeply understand:
    Farmers need steel to conquer nature.
    We fully understand:
    New construction is eagerly awaiting steel.
    We have not forgotten for a moment:
    Soldiers need steel to eliminate wolves!
    We know the weight of the burden falling on our shoulders!
    For steel, we dare to brave the sea of fire,
    For steel, we dare to climb mountains of knives.
    Our momentum is like a tiger, our determination is like steel,
    We will wage a great battle in the steelmaking campaign!
    We will use all the blood of the working class,
    To build the pillars of the communist mansion!
