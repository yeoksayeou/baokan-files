    All Revolutionary Heroic Achievements Originate from Mao Zedong Thought
    Chen Qingkai Bravely Blocks Train with Severed Hand for the Revolution
    The Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the CCP Ministry of Railways Confer the Honorary Title of "Mai Xiande-Type Railway Worker" on Chen Qingkai
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 24th – The Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the CCP Ministry of Railways recently awarded Chen Qingkai the honorary title of "Mai Xiande-Type Railway Worker" and a Red Star Medal.
    Chen Qingkai is a train conductor of the Nanning Train Section of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau. On the morning of February 15th this year, while performing shunting operations at Shigutang Station, in order to prevent a runaway heavy vehicle from causing a serious collision, after taking a series of emergency measures that proved ineffective, he resolutely took off his clothes, twisted them into a ball, and used it to block the wheels of the runaway vehicle, unfortunately having his right hand severed. Ignoring the intense pain, he continued to use his left hand to block the wheels with his clothes, and finally, with the help of other comrades, he stopped the accident from happening.
    At the naming and award ceremony held in Liuzhou on May 25th, Zhang Yan, Political Commissar of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau, on behalf of the Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the CCP Ministry of Railways, read out the order to confer the glorious title of "Mai Xiande-Type Railway Worker" and the Red Star Medal to Comrade Chen Qingkai, and presented the Red Star Medal to Chen Qingkai. Yang Zhihong, Director of the Political Department of the CCP Liuzhou Railway Bureau, read out the letter of condolence from the Political Department of the CCP Ministry of Railways to Comrade Chen Qingkai.
    Comrade Zhang Yan praised Chen Qingkai's heroic act of blocking the train with his severed hand and his revolutionary spirit of facing danger without fear and sacrificing himself for the revolution. He said that all heroic achievements originate from Mao Zedong Thought, and all advanced figures have grown up under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. Comrade Chen Qingkai's ability to fearlessly and heroically stop the vehicle accident and become a "Mai Xiande-Type Railway Worker" is the result of his studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way and establishing the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly.
    Amidst warm applause, Chen Qingkai, the "Mai Xiande-Type Railway Worker," wearing the glittering Red Star Medal, stepped onto the rostrum. He said: "Thank the Party, thank Chairman Mao! I haven't done enough. In the future, I will learn from heroes like Mai Xiande, study Chairman Mao's works hard, and be a good worker of Chairman Mao." Chen Qingkai also used his personal experience to refute the crimes of the Deng Tuo gang in opposing the Party and socialism. He stated that although his right hand is disabled, he still has his left hand and a red heart that will never be disabled, expressing his determination to use his left hand to pick up the pen and open fire on the Deng Tuo gang, actively participating in the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
    At the meeting, representatives of the five-good workers from the Nanning, Yulin, Liuzhou, and other railway areas and directly subordinate organs of the Railway Bureau congratulated Chen Qingkai and expressed their determination to learn from Chen Qingkai.

    一切革命英雄业绩来源于毛泽东思想
    陈庆铠为革命临危不惧断手堵车
    铁道部和中共铁道部政治部授予陈庆铠“麦贤得式的铁路工人”荣誉称号
    新华社南宁二十四日电　铁道部和中共铁道部政治部最近授予陈庆铠以“麦贤得式的铁路工人”荣誉称号，并且授予他红星奖章一枚。
    陈庆铠是柳州铁路局南宁列车段运转车长。今年二月十五日早晨，陈庆铠在石鼓塘车站进行调车作业时，为了制止一辆重车溜逸、可能造成撞车的严重事故，在采取了一系列紧急措施无效之后，毅然脱下衣服，纽成布团，堵塞溜动车辆的车轮，不幸右手掌被压断。他不顾剧痛，继续用左手拿衣服堵塞车轮，最后在其他同志帮助下，终于制止了事故发生。
    五月二十五日在柳州召开的命名、授奖大会上，柳州铁路局政治委员张炎代表铁道部、中共铁道部政治部，宣读了授予陈庆铠同志以“麦贤得式的铁路工人”光荣称号和红星奖章的命令，并且把红星奖章授给了陈庆铠。中共柳州铁路局政治部主任杨志宏，宣读了中共铁道部政治部写给陈庆铠同志的慰问信。
    张炎同志赞扬了陈庆铠断手堵车的英雄事迹和他临危不惧，为革命不怕牺牲的革命精神。他说，一切英雄业绩来源于毛泽东思想，一切先进人物都是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力。陈庆铠同志能够不怕牺牲，英勇顽强地制止车辆事故，成为“麦贤得式的铁路工人”，正是他活学活用毛主席著作，树立了全心全意为人民服务思想的结果。
    在热烈的掌声中，“麦贤得式的铁路工人”陈庆铠，佩戴着红光闪闪的红星奖章，走上了主席台。他说：“感谢党，感谢毛主席！我做得还不够，今后要向麦贤得等英雄人物学习，努力学习毛主席著作，做毛主席的好工人。”陈庆铠还以自己亲身的体会，驳斥了邓拓黑帮反党反社会主义的罪行。他表示，自己右手虽然残废了，还有左手，还有一颗永不残废的红心，表示要用左手提起笔杆，向邓拓黑帮开火，积极投入无产阶级文化大革命的斗争。
    会上，南宁、玉林、柳州等铁路地区和铁路局直属机关，都派了五好职工代表，向陈庆铠祝贺，并且表示决心向陈庆铠学习。
