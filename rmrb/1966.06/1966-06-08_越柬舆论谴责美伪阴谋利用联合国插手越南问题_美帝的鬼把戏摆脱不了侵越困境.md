    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 6th: The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* commented on June 5th on the US-puppet clique's desire for the UN to send "observers" to "supervise" the so-called "elections" of the puppet regime, saying that the UN is not qualified to interfere in the Vietnam issue.

    The commentary said that this "election" farce of the puppet regime is merely a conspiracy by the United States and its running dogs, aimed at dealing with the surging struggle of the South Vietnamese people and preventing the puppet regime from collapsing completely so that the United States can rely on it to continue its dirty war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The commentary said that the US-puppet clique's allowing the UN to "supervise" the so-called "elections" is also intended to legitimize this farce and pave the way for the UN to interfere in Vietnam so that the United States can invade Vietnam according to its own plans.

    The commentary said that, as the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out, the UN has no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue and has no right to accept the illegal demands of the United States and the Saigon puppet regime. It is not qualified to send "observers" to South Vietnam to "supervise" fake "elections" or take any other action to help the American aggressors in South Vietnam.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, June 6th: The Cambodian National Radio commented on the evening of June 4th on the Saigon authorities' invitation to the UN to send "observers" to "supervise" the so-called "elections" held by the South Vietnamese puppet regime, saying: This "is just a conspiracy orchestrated by the United States to get the UN involved in the Vietnam War."

    The radio pointed out: "The US imperialists and their Saigon servants are once again seeking ways to escape their current predicament. They believe that this election farce and the worthless trick of inviting UN 'observers' are the way out of their predicament. But this conspiracy cannot deceive international public opinion."

    *Cambodge* published an editorial on June 6th saying that this new conspiracy of US imperialism and its Saigon running dogs must be strongly condemned. The editorial said: For several years, the Americans have been cunning and have created numerous traps, attempting to send "UN forces" to intervene in neighboring countries. The UN is not only a "legal cloak" that Washington is satisfied with, but also a blatant accomplice to America's crimes in other countries. The editorial said that the US imperialists must respect the 1954 Geneva Accords, especially by withdrawing all their military materials and military personnel, dismantling their bases, and letting the Vietnamese discuss their own problems.

    越柬舆论谴责美伪阴谋利用联合国插手越南问题
    美帝的鬼把戏摆脱不了侵越困境
    据新华社河内六日电　越南《人民报》五日就美伪集团要联合国派“观察员”“监督”伪政权的所谓“选举”发表评论说，联合国没有资格插手越南问题。
    评论说，伪政权的这次“选举”骗局，只不过是美国及其走狗的一个阴谋，目的在于对付越南南方人民风起云涌的斗争，使傀儡政权免于彻底垮台，这样美国才能依靠它继续进行肮脏的侵越战争。
    评论说，美伪集团让联合国来“监督”所谓的“选举”也是为了要使这场丑剧合法化，为联合国干涉越南铺平道路。以便美国能按照自己的计划来侵略越南。
    评论说，正如越南民主共和国外交部发言人指出，联合国没有权利干涉越南问题，没有权利接受美国和西贡伪政权的非法要求。它没有资格派遣“观察员”到南越去“监督”假“选举”，或者采取其他任何行动帮助在南越的美国侵略者。
    新华社金边六日电　柬埔寨国家电台四日晚上就西贡当局邀请联合国派“观察员”“监督”南越伪政权举行的所谓“选举”一事发表评论说：这“只是美国策划的要使联合国插手越南战争的阴谋”。
    电台指出：“美帝国主义者及其西贡仆从又在寻求摆脱目前困境的办法。他们认为，这一选举丑剧以及玩弄邀请联合国派‘观察员’的不值一文的鬼把戏，就是摆脱困境的办法。但是这种阴谋是骗不了国际舆论的。”
    《柬埔寨电讯报》六日发表社论说，必须强烈谴责美帝国主义及其西贡走狗的这个新阴谋。社论说：几年来，美国人诡计多端，圈套层出不穷，企图派遣“联合国部队”干涉邻国。联合国不仅是华盛顿感到满意的一件“合法的外衣”，而且是美国在其他国家犯罪的赤裸裸的帮凶。社论说，美帝国主义者要尊重一九五四年日内瓦协议，特别是撤出他们的一切军事物资和军事人员，拆除他们的基地，并且让越南人商量自己的问题。
