    Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: The Secretariat of the Asia-Pacific Peace Liaison Committee sent a telegram on June 24th to the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace on the 16th anniversary of the Korean People's Fatherland Liberation War, expressing its highest respect to the Korean people who heroically defeated the U.S. imperialist aggression and made significant contributions to defending peace in Asia and the world.

    The telegram said that U.S. imperialism still occupies South Korea, using it as a military base and tool of aggression in Asia. U.S. imperialism directs the South Korean puppet government to send troops to South Vietnam as cannon fodder, directly participating in U.S. imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam. It concocted the "Japan-ROK Treaty," effectively piecing together a "Northeast Asia Military Alliance," and recently orchestrated the anti-communist "Ministerial Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Region" in Seoul, intensifying its conspiratorial plans to expand the war of aggression in Asia, seriously threatening peace in Asia and the world.

    The telegram said: The Asia-Pacific Peace Liaison Committee reiterates its firm support for the Korean people's just struggle to demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and to achieve the peaceful reunification of their fatherland, firmly supports the Korean people's solemn stance against the "Japan-ROK Treaty" and against the "Ministerial Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Region," and deeply believes that the Korean people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle will surely achieve final victory.

    亚太和联致电朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会
    坚决支持朝鲜人民把美军赶出南朝鲜
    新华社二十五日讯　亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处二十四日就朝鲜人民祖国解放战争十六周年致电朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会，向英勇地打败美帝国主义侵略、对捍卫亚洲与世界的和平作出重大贡献的朝鲜人民致崇高的敬意。
    电报说，美帝国主义至今仍霸占着南朝鲜，把南朝鲜作为它在亚洲的军事基地和侵略工具之一。美帝国主义指使南朝鲜傀儡政府派兵去南越作炮灰，直接参与美帝国主义的侵越战争。它炮制了“韩日条约”，实际上拼凑了“东北亚军事联盟”，最近又一手策划在汉城召开了反共的“亚洲及太平洋地区部长会议”，加紧执行其扩大亚洲侵略战争的阴谋计划，严重地威胁着亚洲和世界的和平。
    电报说：亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会重申它坚决支持朝鲜人民要求美军撤出南朝鲜、争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争，坚决支持朝鲜人民反对“韩日条约”和反对“亚洲及太平洋地区部长会议”的严正立场，并深信朝鲜人民反美爱国的斗争一定会取得最后的胜利。
