    (Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, July 7) People from all walks of life in the Lao liberated area of Xiangkhouang deeply love Chairman Mao's works and infinitely revere the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They say that Chairman Mao's books are truth, and Mao Zedong Thought is a beacon guiding the people of the world forward.
    A leading member of the Lao Patriotic Front's Xiangkhouang Provincial Committee said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the truth for oppressed nations and people to carry out struggle. Reading Chairman Mao's books makes people's hearts burn and their minds clear. Chairman Mao's words shine with the light of truth. The more I read, the more I want to read. I have never read such good books."
    A leader of the Lao People's Liberation Army's Xiangkhouang Regional Headquarters told Xinhua reporters: "I love to read Chairman Mao's 'Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War' and 'Long Live the Victory of People’s War' which is permeated with Mao Zedong Thought. These two articles are of great practical significance for our current Lao revolutionary struggle. Chairman Mao's thought on people's war has greatly encouraged our confidence in defeating U.S. imperialism." He also said: "Chairman Mao's works are so suitable for us. When we have problems that we cannot figure out, we look for answers in Chairman Mao's books. We study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind."
    A commander of a certain unit of the air defense force guarding the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain said when talking about reading Chairman Mao's "Talk with the American Correspondent Anna Louise Strong": "Chairman Mao's wise conclusion twenty years ago that all reactionaries are paper tigers is completely correct." He pointed to Phou Kout Mountain and said to reporters: "Look, on this mountain, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have poured thousands of tons of bombs and shells, shaving off two meters of the soil on the mountain, but it still stands tall and remains under the control of our heroic people. Isn't this just as Chairman Mao said, that the human factor is primary? That it is the people, not weapons, that determine the outcome of war?"
    Song Vang, the Governor of Xiangkhouang Province, who had visited China, recently told reporters: "I was very honored to see with my own eyes the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction under the leadership of Chairman Mao during the Chinese National Day in 1965." "In the sixteen years since liberation, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, new China has undergone earth-shaking changes. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought." When talking about his feelings about visiting Dazhai, he said, "The people of Dazhai were able to split mountains to create fields and change their backward appearance because the people grasped and applied Mao Zedong Thought. If the Lao people can also grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will achieve victories as great as those of the people of Dazhai."
    Bo Bun, the person in charge of the Khang Khay "Liberation Army Daily," recently said after translating Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society": "In the past, our concept of class struggle was not very clear. Reading Chairman Mao's article has opened our eyes. Now we are using Chairman Mao's class analysis method to analyze the class situation in Laos, distinguishing who are our friends and who are our enemies."
    Lao writer Souvanthone said: "I like to read all books about the Chinese revolution, but I like to read Chairman Mao's works the most. Chairman Mao's books force me to finish reading them before I put them down. I have read Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' three times." He said, "Chairman Mao's speech has been a great inspiration to me. Every word he said touched my heart. Chairman Mao taught that literary and art workers should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and should go to the heat of the struggle to create. This is absolutely true."
    The Lao people love Chairman Mao's works and love Chairman Mao. Many Lao People's Liberation Army soldiers, youths, women, and old men said to Chinese reporters with great enthusiasm: "Chairman Mao, we love you!"
    Songsi, a commander of a certain unit on the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain, told Xinhua reporters: "The broad masses of soldiers and civilians on the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain have infinite love for Chairman Mao. Whether it is from the radio or in speeches, whenever they hear 'Mao Zedong,' they can't help but cheer: 'Long live Chairman Mao!'" He added, "The Chinese people should always follow Mao Zedong Thought, and we Lao people should also always follow Mao Zedong Thought."
    A commander also told us a touching story: In a battle, among the belongings of a gloriously sacrificed comrade, a notebook was found with a picture of Chairman Mao cut from a pictorial pasted on the first page. Behind the picture was written: "Chairman Mao, we love you!" (Picture attached)
    The Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe came to Chairman Mao's hometown, Shaoshan, and held a joint celebration with the local masses. They felt infinite glory and pride in being able to sing loudly in Chairman Mao's hometown. Xinhua News Agency

    老挝人民崇敬毛主席热爱毛主席著作
    毛主席的话句句闪烁着真理的光芒
    毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务的教导是完全正确的
    据新华社康开七日电 老挝川圹解放区各界人士非常热爱毛主席著作。无限崇敬中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。他们说，毛主席的书是真理，毛泽东思想是指导全世界人民前进的灯塔。
    老挝爱国战线党川圹省委的一位负责人说：“毛泽东思想是被压迫民族和人民进行斗争的真理。读了毛主席的书使人心里发热，心里亮堂，毛主席的话句句闪烁着真理的光芒，越读越想读，我从来还没有读过这样好的书。”
    老挝人民解放军川圹地区指挥部的领导人对新华社记者说：“我最爱读毛主席写的《抗日游击战争的战略问题》和贯穿着毛泽东思想的《人民战争胜利万岁》这两篇文章，对我们当前老挝革命斗争是很有现实意义的。毛泽东主席的人民战争思想，大大鼓舞了我们战胜美帝国主义的信心。”他还说：“毛主席的著作太适合我们了。我们有什么问题搞不清楚，就从毛主席的书里去找寻解答。我们是带着问题来学习毛主席著作的。”
    守卫在富科特山前线防空部队某部指挥员在谈到他读了毛主席《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》时说：“毛主席在二十年前指出的一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，是完全正确的。”他指着富科特山对记者说：“你看，在这座山上美帝国主义和它的走狗曾倾泻下成千上万吨的炸弹和炮弹，把山上的土层就削去了两米，但是它至今仍然屹立着，始终控制在我们英雄人民的手中。这不正如毛主席说的，人的因素第一吗？决定战争的胜负是人民而不是武器吗？”
    曾经访问过中国的川圹省省长宋旺最近对记者说：“我非常荣幸地能在一九六五年中国国庆节时，亲眼看到了中国人民在毛泽东主席领导下在社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就”，“解放十六年来，在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，新中国发生了翻天覆地的变化，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”他在谈到访问大寨的感受时说，“大寨人民能够劈山造田，改变落后面貌，是因为人民掌握和运用了毛泽东思想。如果老挝人民也能掌握了毛泽东思想，就会取得象大寨人民那样巨大的胜利。”
    康开《解放军报》负责人波贲最近在翻译完毛主席《中国社会各阶级的分析》之后说：“过去我们对阶级斗争的概念不太明确，读了毛主席这篇文章，使我们擦亮了眼睛。现在我们就是运用毛主席的阶级分析法来分析我们老挝的阶级情况，分清谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人。”
    老挝作家苏万吞说：“中国革命的书我都喜欢读，但我最喜爱读的是毛主席著作。毛主席的书，迫使我非把它读完才放手。毛泽东主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，我曾读了三遍。”他说：“毛主席这篇讲话对我的启发太大了。他的话句句都说到了我的心里。毛主席教导文艺工作者应当为工农兵服务，应当到火热的斗争中去创作，这是千真万确的。”
    老挝人民热爱毛主席著作，热爱毛主席。许多老挝人民解放军战士、青年、妇女、老大爷都满怀热情对中国记者说出这样的话：“毛主席，我们热爱您！”
    富科特山前线某部指挥员宋西对新华社记者说：“富科特山前线广大军民对毛泽东主席是无限敬爱的，无论是从广播里还是在讲话中，只要听到‘毛泽东’时，就会情不自禁的欢呼：‘毛主席万岁！’”他又说：“中国人民要永远跟着毛泽东思想走，我们老挝人民也要永远跟着毛泽东思想走。”
    一位指挥员还对我们讲述了这样一件感人的事情：在一次战斗里，从一位光荣牺牲的同志的遗物里，发现他留下来的一个笔记本的里面第一页贴着从画报上剪下来的毛主席象片，在象片后面写着：“毛主席，我们热爱您！”（附图片）
    老挝爱国战线党文工团来到毛主席的故乡——韶山，和当地群众举行联欢。他们为自己能在毛主席的故乡高声歌唱，而感到无限光荣和骄傲。　新华社发
