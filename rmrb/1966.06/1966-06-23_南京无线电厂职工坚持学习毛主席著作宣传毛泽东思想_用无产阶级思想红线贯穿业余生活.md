    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd—Workers at the Nanjing Radio Factory in Jiangsu Province are using the red line of proletarian thought to run through their spare time, resisting the influence of bourgeois ideology, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of all factory workers, as well as promoting production. This fact powerfully refutes the fallacies peddled by Deng Tuo and his anti-Party and anti-socialist clique, who advocated that "spare time is a free world for the extensive pursuit of one's first interests."
    The workers' spare time life in this factory is very rich and colorful. After work, from the factory area to the dormitories, from the club to the spare time school, everywhere is full of vigor, vitality, and a lively scene.
    Studying Chairman Mao's works is one of the most important contents of the workers' lives in this factory. Since 1963, the factory has organized more than 400 study groups on Chairman Mao's works. In addition to allocating a certain amount of production time and working time for study, they also use their spare time to study. The vast majority of workers in the factory have achieved carrying Chairman Mao's quotations with them and studying whenever they have time. Many female workers squeeze out time to read a few paragraphs of Chairman Mao's quotations when feeding milk at the nursery and after putting their children to sleep at night. Many collective dormitories also have tutors for studying Chairman Mao's works, who regularly organize collective study. In the family area, more than 90 percent of the workers' families have also joined the study groups on Chairman Mao's works. They also run blackboard newspapers, often copying Chairman Mao's quotations and praising good people and good deeds. In the workers' spare time cultural school, Chairman Mao's works are the most important teaching material for cultural classes. Many workers reflected that this not only helped them learn culture, but more importantly, helped them learn Mao Zedong Thought. Ji Rongxing, an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works and a "Five-Good" worker, said, "Chairman Mao's books are the books of our working class, the books for us to make revolution. Every day before and after work, I have to study a section of Chairman Mao's works. If I don't study for a day, I can't sleep well. Since 1963, I have basically finished reading Volumes One to Four of the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' I have read many important articles many times." He angrily refuted the sinister scheme of Deng Tuo's gang to make people immerse themselves in ancient books and read black talk in their spare time, saying, "That is to make us take the wrong path, we must not fall for it. Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way is the primary task of our revolutionary youth. Only in this way can we become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and not take the revisionist road."
    The workers of this factory also sing revolutionary songs and perform revolutionary modern operas in their spare time. The factory has established an amateur cultural troupe and a choir, and the workshops have singing teams. Factory-wide entertainment performances are held on major holidays. Each workshop also regularly holds small weekend evening parties. In the summer, they hold cool-off evening parties. In recent years, the factory's cultural troupe has successively rehearsed many revolutionary modern operas and a large-scale song and dance drama "Chairman Mao Comes to Our Factory," which was written and performed by the workers themselves. Ten years ago, Chairman Mao visited this factory and greatly encouraged the workers. Over the past ten years, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers of this factory have continuously improved their class consciousness, and production has greatly developed. In this large-scale song and dance drama, in which more than 150 amateur actors participated, it reflected the care of the Party and Chairman Mao for the workers and praised the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. After watching the performance, many workers were greatly motivated and expressed that they would study Chairman Mao's works even better and climb the peak of radio science faster. They also often sing about the deeds of heroic figures such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Jiao Yulu, and also compile the deeds of advanced figures and good people and good deeds in the factory into programs for widespread publicity, so that advanced ideas can take root in people's hearts.
    The workers' spare time sports activities are also very active. More than 50 percent of the workers in the factory participated in various sports, including radio exercises, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, football, weightlifting, shooting, etc. They proposed to exercise their bodies for the revolution.
    The workers of this factory regard spare time cultural and recreational activities as an important front for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. They said: Literature and art are tools of class struggle. Carrying out proletarian cultural and recreational activities is to carry out the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, and to instill Mao Zedong Thought into the workers. Because in the rich spare time life, the workers used proletarian thought to resist the bourgeois and revisionist ideological toxins that Deng Tuo and others tried their best to sell, and armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, they cultivated the revolutionary interests of the proletariat. They believe that interests have class character, and a person's interests are determined by his class stand. Standing on the bourgeois stand, one can only have bourgeois interests, and standing on the proletarian stand, one can only have proletarian interests. Ji Rongxing, a "Five-Good" worker, said: "The interests promoted by Deng Tuo and his ilk are bourgeois interests, reactionary 'interests.' The interest of our working class is to master Mao Zedong Thought and better serve the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. As for me, since studying Chairman Mao's works, I have understood the truth of serving the people. Therefore, in my spare time, I can do more service work for everyone. When the factory holds evening parties, I help to pull the curtains, fetch washing water for the actors, and clean the stage. When the factory shows movies, I help to collect tickets. These are all things I am happy to do in my spare time." Chen Deli, a "Five-Good" worker and leader of the supply group in the Third Workshop, said: "What Deng Tuo advocated, such as fishing, dancing, and playing cards, is like a dandy, which does not conform to our proletarian thought and is not the interest of our workers. Serving the people is our interest. Most of the comrades in our supply group are old workers in their forties, but we all want to do more for socialist construction. Since last year, the waste and scrap materials recycled by our group of seven in their spare time have been worth more than 20,000 yuan. When we see many wastes being reused in production, we feel very happy in our hearts, which is our greatest interest." Xu Dutai, a red housekeeper and old worker, has spent his spare time almost every day for more than ten years checking more than 30 garbage bins in the factory, not letting any useful materials be mixed in the garbage. He has worked as a handyman, messenger, warehouse keeper, and guard, but he has always regarded checking the garbage bins as something he should do. Although the spare time life contents of these "Five-Good" workers and old workers are different, they all run through the red line of serving the people and shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Their rich spare time life is the best answer to the question of interests.

    南京无线电厂职工坚持学习毛主席著作宣传毛泽东思想
    用无产阶级思想红线贯穿业余生活
    据新华社南京二十二日电　江苏省南京无线电厂职工用无产阶级思想红线贯穿业余生活，抵制资产阶级思想影响，促进了全厂职工的思想革命化，也促进了生产。这一事实有力地批驳了邓拓一伙反党反社会主义分子鼓吹的“业余时间是第一兴趣广泛驰骋的自由天地”的谬论。
    这个厂的职工业余生活非常丰富多采。下班后，从厂区到宿舍，从俱乐部到业余学校，到处是朝气蓬勃，龙腾虎跃，一派生动活泼的景象。
    学习毛主席著作是这个厂职工生活中的一个最重要的内容。从一九六三年以来，全厂就组织了四百多个学习毛主席著作小组。他们除抽出一定的生产时间和工作时间学习外，还利用业余时间学习。全厂绝大部分职工都做到了毛主席语录随身带，有空就学。不少女工上托儿所喂奶时和晚上安排小孩睡觉以后，都挤出时间读几段毛主席语录。许多集体宿舍还设有学习毛主席著作辅导员，经常组织集体学习。在家属区，百分之九十以上的职工家属也都参加了毛主席著作学习小组。他们还办了黑板报，经常抄写毛主席语录，表扬好人好事。在职工业余文化学校里，毛主席著作是文化课的最主要的教材。许多工人反映说，这样不仅学习了文化，更重要的是学习了毛泽东思想。学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好职工季荣兴说：“毛主席的书是我们工人阶级的书，是我们干革命的书。每天上班前下班后，我都要学习一段毛主席著作。一天不学，觉也睡不好。从一九六三年以来，我已经基本上读完了《毛泽东选集》一到四卷。其中许多重要文章，都读了许多遍”。他愤怒驳斥邓拓黑帮要人们在业余时间钻古书、读黑话的恶毒阴谋说，“那是要我们走邪路，我们决不能上他的当。活学活用毛主席著作，是我们革命青年的首要任务，只有这样，才能成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，不走修正主义的道路。”
    这个厂的职工还在业余时间内大唱革命歌曲，演革命现代戏。厂里成立有业余文工团、合唱团，车间有合唱队。每逢重大节日就举行全厂性的文娱演出。各车间还经常举行小型周末晚会。夏天就举行乘凉晚会。厂里的文工团近几年先后排演过不少革命现代戏和自编自演的六场歌舞剧《毛主席来到我们厂》等大型节目。十年前，毛主席曾经到这个厂来视察过，对工人鼓舞很大。十年来，这个厂职工在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，阶级觉悟不断提高，生产有了很大发展。在这个有一百五十多名业余演员参加演出的大型歌舞剧中，反映了党和毛主席对工人的关怀，歌颂毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。许多工人看了演出以后，干劲倍增，表示要更好地学习毛主席著作，更快地攀登无线电科学高峰。他们还经常演唱雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄等英雄人物的事迹，并且把本厂先进人物的事迹和好人好事编成节目，广泛进行宣传，使先进思想深入人心。
    职工业余体育活动也很活跃。全厂百分之五十以上的职工都参加了各种体育运动，有广播操、篮球、排球、乒乓球、足球、举重、射击等。他们提出要为革命锻炼身体。
    这个厂的职工把业余文娱活动当作是宣传毛泽东思想的重要阵地。他们说：文艺是阶级斗争的工具，开展无产阶级的文娱活动，就是进行兴无灭资的斗争，就是把毛泽东思想灌输到工人中去。由于职工在丰富的业余生活中，用无产阶级思想抵制了邓拓等所竭力推销的资产阶级、修正主义的思想毒素，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，培养了无产阶级的革命兴趣。他们认为，兴趣是有阶级性的，一个人的兴趣是由他的阶级立场决定的。站在资产阶级立场上，就只能有资产阶级的兴趣，站在无产阶级立场上，就只能有无产阶级的兴趣。五好职工季荣兴说：“邓拓之流宣扬的兴趣是资产阶级的兴趣，是反动的‘兴趣’。我们工人阶级的兴趣就是要把毛泽东思想学到手，更好地为中国革命和世界革命服务。拿我来说，自从学习了毛主席著作以后，懂得了为人民服务的道理。因此，在业余时间里，能为大家多做
  一些服务工作，厂里开晚会，我就帮助拉幕，为演员打洗脸水，打扫舞台。厂里放电影，就帮助收门票。这些事都是我在业余时间乐意做的事。”五好工人、三车间供应组组长陈德礼说：“邓拓提倡的什么钓鱼呀、跳舞呀、打牌呀，象个花花公子，这不符合我们无产阶级的思想，不是我们工人的兴趣。为人民服务才是我们的兴趣。我们供应组大部分同志都是四十多岁的老工人，但是我们都想为社会主义建设多做点事情。去年以来，我们组七个人，利用业余时间回收的废物废料，价值就达两万多元。当我们看到许多废物又重新用到生产上去，心里就乐滋滋的，这就是我们最大的兴趣。”红色管家人、老工人徐度太，十多年来，几乎每天都要抽出业余时间，查看全厂三十多个垃圾箱，不让一点有用的材料混在垃圾里。他干过勤杂工、传达员、保管员、警卫员等工作，但是始终把查看垃圾箱看作自己应该做的事。这些五好职工和老工人的业余生活内容虽然各有不同，但是都贯穿着为人民服务这根红线，闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉。他们的丰富的业余生活，就是关于兴趣问题的最好答案。
