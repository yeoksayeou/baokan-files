    Editor's note: Education is a tool of class struggle. If education does not serve proletarian politics, it will serve bourgeois politics. Bourgeois education serves bourgeois politics; they want to cultivate their own successors and satisfactory slaves for the bourgeoisie, to serve the bourgeoisie's exploitation and oppression of the working people. Education in our socialist New China must serve proletarian politics to ensure the socialist road. If our education deviates from proletarian politics, it will go astray and become a tool for bourgeois politics.

    The experience of Xingmin Middle School shows that there is a serious class struggle on the ideological front of school education. The debate over whether Xingmin Middle School should adhere to class and class struggle education reflects two classes, two educational ideologies, and two educational lines. Those who adhere to the reactionary bourgeois educational ideology and educational line will do everything possible to instill the decadent bourgeois ideology into the new generation through teaching and other activities, attempting to cultivate them into successors of the bourgeoisie. If our schools do not emphasize proletarian politics, do not use politics to lead teaching, and do not resolutely implement Chairman Mao's educational thought and the Party's educational policy, the educational front of the school will be in danger of being occupied by the bourgeoisie, and it will be impossible to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Xingmin Middle School initially did not emphasize politics, and bourgeois ideology took advantage of the gap to corrupt young students, so that some people yearned to take the road of bourgeois experts. Later, they grasped the prominence of politics, grasped class and class struggle as the key link, and conscientiously educated teachers to take the road of revolutionization and laborization, first transforming the thinking of educators, which grasped the fundamental and grasped the direction. Therefore, fundamental changes have taken place in school education, thereby cultivating a group of laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. This is the result of emphasizing politics in education.

    Facts prove that emphasizing politics is the foundation of all work. Politics must lead teaching. This is the only way to ensure that the school, an important front of class struggle, is firmly in the hands of the proletariat and serves proletarian politics.

    Xingmin Middle School in Xingning County, Guangdong Province, has insisted on emphasizing politics, taking class struggle as the key link, and vigorously grasping the education of class struggle in recent years, ensuring the socialist direction of education and cultivating a group of laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, who have played an active role in the three great revolutionary movements.

    Education is a Tool of Class Struggle

    Xingmin Middle School is a full-time junior middle school founded in 1956. In the process of running the school for several years, school leaders gradually realized that education is a tool of class struggle, and the school is an important front of class struggle. The class struggle and the struggle between two lines in school education are very complex and acute, and it is concentrated in the issue of competing with the bourgeoisie for the younger generation. Those who have bourgeois educational ideas use the reactionary ideas of becoming famous, establishing a career, and pursuing fame and profit to corrupt young people, attempting to cultivate them into successors of the bourgeoisie. The proletariat educates young people with Mao Zedong Thought and cultivates them into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Only by highlighting proletarian politics can we cultivate proletarian successors. Four years ago, because the school leadership did not realize the seriousness of this problem and did not highlight politics, many of the people cultivated were unwilling to be ordinary laborers, but yearned to take the road of bourgeois experts, and some even degenerated into criminals. In 1962, the school organized some teachers to conduct a survey of 200 graduates and found that many graduates were not at ease working in the countryside, believing that participating in agricultural production was not promising. Although some graduates were children of working people, after reading books for several years, their ideological feelings with the working people became more and more distant, and they could not use the abacus, could not repair agricultural tools, and could not even distinguish between barnyard grass and rice seedlings. This situation made school leaders and some teachers realize that school education neglects politics, is divorced from the masses, is divorced from labor, and is divorced from reality, so it cannot cultivate the talents needed for socialist revolution and socialist construction, cannot create a new generation of proletarian revolutionaries, and can only cultivate new bourgeois intellectuals who are divorced from the working people.

    The Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party sounded the alarm for them. Subsequently, the Xingning County Party Committee seriously asked: Who does the school serve? Are the people cultivated building the walls of socialism or digging the foundations of socialism? This awakened the school leaders from the quagmire of bourgeois educational thought of unilaterally pursuing the rate of entering schools, realizing that what kind of people to cultivate is a class struggle. To run a socialist school well, we must highlight politics and grasp the education of class and class struggle.

    However, whether or not to adhere to the education of class and class struggle, there are two different views among the teachers of Xingmin Middle School, and a debate of two different ideas unfolded. Some old teachers were deeply poisoned by bourgeois education before liberation, and bourgeois educational thought was more serious. They regard education as a trans-class thing, so they deny social practice and emphasize "not asking about politics." Some teachers still have the feudalistic thoughts of "only reading is noble" and "those who study well will become officials." Even some young teachers who were cultivated after liberation also have bourgeois educational ideas because they were influenced by bourgeois ideas, such as emphasizing business and neglecting politics, emphasizing intellectual education and neglecting moral education, in a word, emphasizing expertise and neglecting redness. Therefore, when the school emphasizes carrying out class struggle education, some people think that the main task of the school is teaching, and grasping too much class and class struggle education will affect the teaching "quality"; some also think that most of the students in Xingmin Middle School are from poor and lower-middle peasant families, and there is no need to carry out class and class struggle education for them; some say that these young students were born in the new society and grew up under the red flag, white as a piece of paper, why bother to use class struggle education to frustrate their young minds. These arguments are actually advocating the cancellation of class struggle education. If a serious struggle is not launched among teachers, and proletarian educational thought does not occupy the position, then bourgeois educational thought will run rampant, the leadership of education will be grasped by bourgeois intellectuals, the education revolution cannot be deepened, and ultimately revisionism will be produced. School leaders realized the seriousness of the problem, so they launched a debate among teachers about two educational ideas and two roads: for whom to run the school, and what kind of talents can be considered qualified. By studying Mao Zedong's educational thought and the Party's educational policy, criticizing bourgeois educational thought, especially criticizing the idea of unilaterally pursuing the rate of entering schools, they adhered to taking class struggle education as the key link to ensure that school education takes the socialist road.

    The Key Lies in the Ideological Remolding of Teachers

    To run a socialist school well, the key lies in the ideological remolding of teachers. Because teachers are educators, the Party's education policy is realized through the teaching activities of teachers. However, the ideological remolding of teachers is a fundamental change of world outlook, which cannot be solved through several debates and criticisms. The leaders of Xingmin Middle School believe that the fundamental way to transform teachers' thinking is to take the road of revolutionization and laborization. Only in this way can teachers' old ideas and old concepts be gradually changed, and the realization of education serving proletarian politics and the combination of teaching and production labor can be achieved. They organized teachers to go to the countryside to eat, live, and work with poor and lower-middle peasants, gradually changing teachers' contempt for labor, the exploiting class ideology of despising working people, and establishing labor viewpoints and mass viewpoints. They organized teachers to participate in the socialist education movement and undergo the tempering of class struggle. They also often organized teachers to conduct social class investigations, which is also a profound class education for teachers. In 1963 and 1964, the school, led by the principal, sent teachers to the countryside, factories, and streets four times to conduct class investigations. Before the investigation, they organized teachers to study Mao Zedong's works such as "How to Analyze Rural Classes" and "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," and studied the spirit of the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, requiring them to use Mao Zedong's viewpoint of class and class struggle to conduct investigations. Through in-depth visits to the poor and inquiring about suffering, teachers investigated the "Four Histories" (village history, factory history, family history, street history); investigated the atrocities of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Xingning; investigated the history of how landlords, tyrants, and capitalists made their fortunes; investigated the history of the struggle of Red Guards during the Great Revolution, the history of blood and tears of dockworkers, and the deeds of revolutionary heroes, as well as the current situation of class enemies competing for the younger generation; and investigated the opium dens, casinos, brothels, temples, ancestral halls, and other materials in the old society, and visited all kinds of people. During the investigation, teachers heard many blood and tearful accusations from poor and lower-middle peasants; collected many pieces of evidence of the crimes of the exploiting classes; compiled and drew more than 100,000 words and dozens of sets of class struggle historical materials and pictures.

    These class investigations were very profound for the teachers' education. Some teachers reflected: The class investigation is unforgettable for life. A young teacher visited an 81-year-old overseas Chinese worker. This old overseas Chinese worker was sold to Indonesia as a "piglet" when he was more than ten years old, worked for the colonialists for more than 30 years, and was forced to return to his hometown after losing his labor force, penniless, begging for a living. Only after liberation did he turn over, and now he is a "five-guarantee" household. When the old overseas Chinese worker complained to the point of suffering, he hugged the teacher and cried, "You must tell my suffering to the students and let them remember this class hatred." The teacher was deeply moved and said in tears, "I will definitely remember the bitterness of the class and the hatred of the nation, and educate the students well." Through class investigation, teachers have a deeper understanding of class and exploitation, and understand what is class bitterness and class hatred, so they realize that only with a class viewpoint can they distinguish between right and wrong, love and hate clearly; teachers also see more clearly that class and class struggle still exist in society, and socialist society is by no means calm. Class enemies are trying every means to restore capitalism. If they think that school work can ignore politics and only manage teaching, or emphasize business and neglect politics, then they will give up the school position to the bourgeoisie. Through class investigation, teachers have a deeper understanding of Mao Zedong's saying: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all ideas are branded with class." They exposed and criticized their own bourgeois educational thoughts. They further criticized the one-sided pursuit of the rate of entering schools, criticized the bourgeois "trans-class" viewpoint and the tendency of teaching without teaching people, criticized the phenomenon of teaching being divorced from labor, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses, clarified the direction of running the school, and realized that they must use Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything, and must follow Chairman Mao's instructions on class, class contradictions, and class struggle, and use class education as the main subject.

    Class Struggle is a Main Subject

    After class education was determined as the main subject, the school talked about it every day, every month, every year, and everyone talked about it. It talked about the class struggle in the past, and also talked about the class struggle in real life; it talked about the domestic class struggle, and also talked about the international class struggle. In short, it is necessary to give teachers and students a strong class and class struggle viewpoint, and deeply engrave several large characters in their minds: Never forget class struggle.

    Every year, the first political lesson for new students is to visit the class education exhibition hall. The materials displayed in the exhibition hall are all investigated, collected, and compiled by the teachers and students of the school in recent years, and are living textbooks of class education. Teachers are educators and also educated.

    The school's political class teaching is closely combined with class education, using the exhibition hall as a classroom, and the teacher lectures on the spot, targeting the students' active thoughts. For example, when teaching the class struggle textbook in the socialist society period, guide students to study Mao Zedong's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," visit the exhibition, and use class meetings and group activities to take students to nearby rural areas to investigate, and let students discuss "landlords have no land, rich peasants are not rich, and there is no class struggle," and help students improve their understanding. The political class has become a combat class to transform people.

    The school combines class struggle education with real struggle, so that class education is combined with domestic and international class struggle, the three major revolutionary movements, and labor education. For example, let teachers lead students to participate in some activities of the rural socialist education movement, invite leaders of rural areas and factories to the school to talk about the situation of the three major revolutionary struggles in urban and rural areas, and invite graduates from the front lines of the three major revolutionary struggles to introduce the actual struggle situation. During busy farming holidays, teachers and students are organized to go to the countryside to combine labor with visiting the poor and inquiring about suffering, cultivating class feelings for poor and lower-middle peasants. At the same time, combined with major class struggle events in the international arena, combined with the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, teachers and students are often educated to remember that there are still millions of people in the world who have not been liberated, and teaching and learning are not only for the Chinese revolution, but also for the world revolution.

    In order to make class education more detailed and vivid, Xingmin Middle School also selected more than a dozen brigades and factories as off-campus education bases, and hired more than 70 old poor peasants, old workers, and old revolutionary fighters as a team to conduct class education for teachers and students regularly. The school took students to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasant students to hold recollection meetings, hold theme class meetings with different contents, and hold recollection and sweet education meetings combining parents, teachers, and students. This education is very targeted. For example, student Guo Zhuzhen forgot the bitterness of the class, performed poorly, and did not study hard. The head teacher took him to visit the school exhibition hall to see the history and pictures of his family, and took him home to hold a family recollection meeting. When his father talked about the freezing and starvation of fifteen people in his family and the killing of ten people by the enemy before liberation, the whole family wept bitterly. His father said: "I suffered so much in the old society. I didn't expect you to go to my opposite side today." Guo Zhuzhen was deeply moved and expressed to the head teacher and his parents: "I will never be a spendthrift, always remember class hatred, and be a successor to the revolution!" Later, he made great progress, joined the Communist Youth League, and was elected as a class cadre.

    Xingmin Middle School grasps class struggle education, requires it to go deep into the hearts of the people, firmly root the ideas of class and class struggle, so that they do not forget the past, do not forget class struggle, do not forget the bloodshed and sacrifice of revolutionary martyrs, do not forget the world revolution, and do not forget the kindness of Chairman Mao; requires them to establish the lofty aspirations of the proletariat, not be afraid of hardship, not be afraid of death, teach for the people, teach for the revolution, learn for the people, and learn for the revolution.

    Achievements of Emphasizing Politics in Education

    Class struggle is effective once grasped. Xingmin Middle School highlights politics, vigorously grasps the education of class and class struggle, initially transforms the thinking of teachers, improves the class consciousness of students, and cultivates a group of laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

    In the past few years, more than 700 students have graduated from this school. In addition to more than 200 people who have been promoted to higher-level schools, the vast majority of the rest have returned to the countryside. Some have been sent to the army. Those who are sent to higher-level schools are praised by higher-level schools; those who are sent to the army generally perform well, and many have become "five-good" soldiers and joined the Party; many of those who are sent to the agricultural front have become the backbone of building a new socialist countryside. Zhang Ziyan, who graduated in 1961 and returned to his hometown, has now joined the Party and is working as the deputy director of the commune. Rao Zhenlin, who graduated in 1962 and returned to his hometown, has also joined the Party. He is an activist in studying Mao Zedong's works and is now the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the commune. Huang Juying, who graduated the year before last, "carries a hoe to make revolution." In order to transform low-yielding fields, she and six classmates led the youth of the team to dig dung pits, dig pond mud, accumulate fertilizer to improve the soil, and transport water to fight drought, so that 12 mu of low-yielding fields achieved a yield of more than 700 catties per mu. Now she is an activist in studying Mao Zedong's works in Xingning County and a "five-good" Communist Youth League cadre in the commune. There are many such examples. Students who join the army, such as Huang Zhenhua, who graduated in 1963, study and apply Mao Zedong's works creatively after joining the army, work hard to practice hard skills, and have become a "five-good" soldier and an excellent member of the Communist Youth League. The instructor of the company where Huang Zhenhua is located said: This is because the school has cultivated good seedlings. A middle school Party branch secretary once said after listening to the introduction of Huang Zhenhua's deeds: What kind of successors the school is cultivating can be found from Huang Zhenhua. This is a question that deserves the deep thought of our educators.

    Because of the correct leadership of the county Party committee, the school has a good leadership core, resolutely implements the Party's education policy, so it can bring up the teaching staff and run the school well. However, the current victory is only the beginning. The transformation of the teaching staff is still an arduous problem. The struggle between two educational ideas and two roads needs to be further implemented into teaching activities. We must firmly grasp this socialist ideological position of the school in the hands of the proletariat.

    广东兴民中学突出政治展开教育思想的两条道路的斗争
    抓阶级斗争这条纲　用阶级教育作主课
    编者按：教育是阶级斗争的工具。教育不为无产阶级政治服务，就为资产阶级政治服务。资产阶级的教育是为资产阶级政治服务的，他们是要为资产阶级培养自己的接班人以及称心如意的奴才，为资产阶级剥削和压迫劳动人民效劳。我们社会主义新中国的教育，一定要为无产阶级政治服务，保证走社会主义的道路。我们的教育事业，如果脱离无产阶级的政治，那就会走到邪路上去，变成为资产阶级政治服务的工具。
    兴民中学的办学经验表明，在学校教育这个思想阵地里，是有严重的阶级斗争的。兴民中学要不要坚持阶级和阶级斗争教育的争论，正是两个阶级、两种教育思想、两条教育路线的反映。坚持资产阶级反动的教育思想和教育路线的人，一定会千方百计地通过教学等活动，把腐朽没落的资产阶级思想灌输给新的一代，力图把他们培养成资产阶级的接班人。我们的学校，如果不突出无产阶级政治，不用政治统帅教学，不坚决贯彻执行毛主席的教育思想和党的教育方针，学校的教育阵地就有被资产阶级占领的危险，也就不可能培养出无产阶级革命事业的接班人。兴民中学开始没有突出政治，资产阶级思想就乘虚而入，去腐蚀青少年学生，以至有些人向往走资产阶级专家的道路。后来，他们抓了突出政治，抓了阶级和阶级斗争这条纲，认真教育教师们走革命化、劳动化的道路，首先改造教育者的思想，这就抓住了根本，抓住了方向。因此，学校教育就发生了根本变化，从而培养出了一批具有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。这是突出政治办教育所取得的成果。
    事实证明，突出政治是一切工作的根本。政治必须统帅教学。这样才能保证学校这个阶级斗争的重要阵地，牢固地掌握在无产阶级手里，为无产阶级的政治服务。
    广东省兴宁县兴民中学，几年来坚持突出政治，以阶级斗争为纲，狠抓阶级斗争的教育，保证了社会主义教育方向，培养出一批有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，在三大革命运动中起了积极作用。
    教育是阶级斗争的工具
    兴民中学是一九五六年创办的一所全日制初级中学。在几年办学过程中，学校领导干部逐步认识到，教育是阶级斗争的工具，学校是阶级斗争的重要阵地。学校教育中的阶级斗争、两条道路的斗争是非常复杂、尖锐的，它集中表现在跟资产阶级争夺青少年一代的问题上。具有资产阶级教育思想的人，以成名成家、为名为利的一套反动思想去腐蚀青少年，企图把他们培养成资产阶级的接班人。无产阶级以毛泽东思想去教育青少年，把他们培养成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。只有突出无产阶级的政治，才能培养出无产阶级的接班人。四年以前，由于学校领导上没有认识到这个问题的严重性，没有突出政治，结果培养出来的人很多不愿做一个普通劳动者，而向往走资产阶级专家的道路，个别的甚至堕落成犯罪分子。一九六二年，学校组织一部分教师对两百名毕业生进行了调查，发现许多毕业生不安心在农村工作，认为参加农业生产没出息。有些毕业生虽然是劳动人民的子弟，读了几年书以后，同劳动人民的思想感情反而越离越远，而且拿起算盘不会打，农具坏了不会修，甚至连稗草和秧苗都分辨不清。这种情况使学校领导干部和一部分教师认识到，学校教育忽视政治，脱离群众，脱离劳动，脱离实际，就不能培养出社会主义革命和社会主义建设所需要的人材，就不能造就无产阶级的革命的新一代，只能培养成脱离劳动人民的新的资产阶级知识分子。
    党的八届十中全会给他们敲了警钟。接着，兴宁县委严肃地提出：学校到底是为谁服务？培养出来的人是给社会主义筑墙，还是挖社会主义的墙脚？这一下才把学校领导干部从片面追求升学率的资产阶级教育思想的泥坑中惊醒过来，认识到培养什么样的人是一场阶级斗争。要办好社会主义的学校，就必须突出政治，抓阶级和阶级斗争的教育。
    但是，要不要坚持阶级和阶级斗争的教育，兴民中学的教师中有着两种不同的看法，展开了两种不同思想的争论。有一些老教师，在解放前受资产阶级教育思想的毒害比较深，资产阶级的教育思想比较严重。他们把教育说成是超阶级的东西，因此否认社会实践，强调“不问政治”。有一部分教师还残存着“唯有读书高”、“学而优则仕”的封建主义思想。就是解放后培养出来的一些年轻教师，也因为受了资产阶级思想的影响，存在着资产阶级教育思想，如重业务、轻政治，重智育、轻德育，一句话，重专轻红。因此，当学校强调进行阶级斗争教育的时候，就有人认为，学校的主要任务是教学，阶级和阶级斗争教育抓多了，会影响教学“质量”；有的还认为，兴民中学学生大部分出身于贫下中农家庭，对他们用不着进行阶级和阶级斗争的教育；有的说，这些青少年学生生在新社会，长在红旗下，白似一张纸，何必要用阶级斗争的教育去挫伤他们幼小的心灵。这些论调，实际上都是主张取消阶级斗争的教育。如果不在教师中开展一场严重的斗争，无产阶级教育思想不去占领阵地，那末资产阶级教育思想就会泛滥起来，教育的领导权，就会掌握到资产阶级知识分子的手里去，教育革命就不能深入，最终将会产生修正主义。学校领导干部意识到了问题的严重性，于是在教师中开展了为谁办学，培养的人材怎样才算合格的两种教育思想、两条道路的争论。通过学习毛主席的教育思想和党的教育方针，批判了资产阶级教育思想，特别是批判了片面追求升学率的思想，坚持了以阶级斗争教育为纲，保证学校教育走社会主义的道路。
    关键在于教师的思想改造
    要办好社会主义学校，关键在于教师的思想改造。因为教师是教育者，党的教育方针是通过教师的教学活动去实现的。但是，教师的思想改造是一个世界观的根本改变问题，决不是通过几次争论和批判就能解决的。兴民中学的领导干部认为，改造教师思想的根本途径，是走革命化、劳动化的道路，只有这样，才能逐步改变教师的旧思想旧观念，实现教育为无产阶级政治服务，教学与生产劳动相结合。他们组织教师到农村去跟贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，逐步改变教师轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民的剥削阶级思想，树立劳动观点，群众观点。他们组织教师参加社会主义教育运动，经受阶级斗争的锻炼。他们还经常组织教师进行社会阶级调查，这对教师也是一种深刻的阶级教育。学校在一九六三、一九六四两年内，由校长带领教师，四次下乡、下厂、下街道进行阶级调查。调查以前，组织教师学习了毛主席的《怎样分析农村阶级》、《中国社会各阶级的分析》等著作，学习了党的八届十中全会的精神，要求用毛主席的阶级和阶级斗争观点下去作调查。教师们通过深入访贫问苦，调查了“四史”（村史、厂史、家史、街史）；调查了美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮在兴宁的暴行；调查了地主、恶霸、资本家的发家史；调查了大革命时期赤卫队员的斗争史，搬运工人的血泪史和革命英雄人物的斗争事迹，以及当前阶级敌人争夺青少年一代的情况；还调查了旧社会的烟馆、赌场、妓院和神庙、祠堂等等材料，访问了各种各样的人物。调查中，教师们听到贫下中农许许多多的血泪控诉；搜集了剥削阶级的许多罪证；编绘了包括十多万字和几十套的阶级斗争史料和图片。
    这些阶级调查对教师的教育非常深刻。一些教师反映：阶级调查，毕生难忘。有一位青年教师访问了一位八十一岁的老侨工。这位老侨工十多岁时曾被当作“猪仔”卖到印度尼西亚，为殖民主义者干了三十多年，失却劳力后，被迫回到家乡，一无所有，讨饭度日，解放后才翻了身，如今是五保户。老侨工诉到苦处时，抱住这位教师大哭说：“你一定要把我的苦告诉学生，让他们记住这种阶级仇恨。”这位教师深受感动，也声泪俱下地说：“我一定牢记阶级苦，民族恨，教育好学生。”通过阶级调查，教师们对阶级和剥削有了较深的理解，懂得了什么是阶级苦、阶级恨，从而认识到，有了阶级观点，才能明辨是非，爱憎分明；教师们也更加清楚地看到了社会上还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，社会主义社会决不是风平浪静的，阶级敌人正千方百计企图复辟，如果认为学校工作可以不问政治而只管教学，或者重业务轻政治，那就会把学校这个阵地让给资产阶级。通过阶级调查，教师们对毛主席所说的：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”这句话体会得比过去深了，对自己的资产阶级教育思想作了揭露和批判。他们进一步批判了片面追求升学率，批判了资产阶级的“超阶级”观点和教书不教人的倾向，批判了教学脱离劳动，脱离实际，脱离群众的现象，明确了办学方向，认识到必须用毛泽东思想统帅一切，要遵照毛主席关于阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的指示，用阶级教育作主课。
    阶级斗争是门主课
    以阶级教育为主课确定下来以后，学校便天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，人人讲。既讲过去的阶级斗争，也讲现实生活中的阶级斗争；既讲国内的阶级斗争，也讲国际上的阶级斗争。总之，要使教师和学生有强烈的阶级和阶级斗争观点，在头脑中深深刻上几个大字：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。
    每年，新生入学的第一堂政治课，就是参观阶级教育展览馆。展览馆内陈列的材料都是几年来全校师生自己调查搜集和编绘的，是阶级教育的活教材。教师是教育者，也是受教育者。
    学校的政治课教学与阶级教育紧密结合起来，利用展览馆作为课堂，老师讲课时，针对学生的活思想，进行现场讲学。如讲社会主义社会时期的阶级斗争课文时，引导学生学习毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，参观展览会，又利用班会和团的活动，带学生到附近农村调查，让学生自己讨论“地主没地，富农不富，没有阶级斗争了”这种说法对不对，帮助学生提高认识。政治课成了改造人的战斗课。
    学校把阶级斗争教育与现实斗争联系起来，使阶级教育同国内外阶级斗争、三大革命运动和劳动教育相结合。如让教师带领学生参加农村社会主义教育运动的一些活动，请农村和工厂的领导人来校讲城乡三大革命斗争形势，请来自三大革命斗争第一线的毕业生介绍实际斗争情况等。农忙假期，组织教师和学生下乡，结合劳动访贫问苦，培养对贫下中农的阶级感情。同时，结合国际范围重大的阶级斗争事件，结合反帝反修斗争，经常地对教师和学生进行教育，使教师和学生经常记住世界上还有千千万万的人民没有解放，教书和学习，不仅是为了中国革命，而且也是为了世界革命。
    为了使阶级教育抓得更细，更活，兴民中学还选择了十多个大队和工厂作为校外的教育基地，并聘请了老贫农、老工人、老革命战士七十多人，作为经常对教师和学生进行阶级教育的队伍。学校把学生带到贫下中农学生家中去开忆苦会，开不同内容的主题班会，以及开家长、教师、学生三结合的忆苦思甜教育会等。这种教育，针对性强。如学生郭主镇，忘了阶级苦，表现不好，不认真学习。班主任一面带他参观学校展览馆展出的他的家史和图片，一面带他回家开家庭忆苦会，当他父亲讲到解放前家里十五口人冻死饿死和被敌人杀死十口人时，全家痛哭流涕。他父亲说：“我在旧社会受那么深的苦，想不到你今天要走到我的反面去了。”郭主镇深受感动，便在班主任和自己的家长面前表示：“决不作败家子，永记阶级仇，做革命接班人！”后来他进步很大，加入了共青团，被选为班干部。
    兴民中学抓阶级斗争教育，要求深入人心，牢牢地扎下阶级和阶级斗争的思想根子，做到不忘过去，不忘阶级斗争，不忘革命先烈流血牺牲，不忘世界革命，不忘毛主席恩情；要求立下无产阶级的雄心壮志，不怕苦，不怕死，为人民而教，为革命而教，为人民而学，为革命而学。
    突出政治办教育的成果
    阶级斗争，一抓就灵。兴民中学突出政治，狠抓阶级和阶级斗争的教育，初步改造了教师的思想，提高了学生们的阶级觉悟，培养出一批具有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    几年来，这个学校已经有七百多名学生毕业，除二百多人升入高一级学校学习以外，其余绝大多数回到了农村。有的输送到了部队。输送到高一级学校的，得到了高一级学校的赞许；输送到部队的，一般表现也很好，不少人成了五好战士，并入了党；输送到农业战线的，很多人成了建设社会主义新农村的骨干。一九六一年毕业回乡的张子炎，现在已经入党，担任了公社副社长的工作。一九六二年毕业回乡的饶振粦，也入了党，是学习毛主席著作积极分子，现在已是公社的团委副书记。前年毕业的黄菊英，“扛起锄头闹革命”，为了改造低产田，她同六个同学一起，带领队里的青年掏粪坑，挖塘泥，积肥改土，车水抗旱，使十二亩低产田获得亩产七百多斤的丰收。现在她是兴宁县学习毛主席著作积极分子，公社五好团干部。象这样的例子很多。参加部队的学生，如一九六三年毕业的黄振华，参军后活学活用毛主席著作，苦练过硬本领，已成为五好战士，优秀的共青团员。黄振华所在的连队指导员说：这是学校育苗育得好。有个中学党支部书记一次听了黄振华的事迹介绍后说：学校培养什么样的接班人，从黄振华身上找到了答案，这是值得我们教育工作者深思的一个问题。
    兴民中学由于县委的正确领导，学校有一个好的领导核心，坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针，因此能把教师队伍带起来，办好学校。但是，目前的胜利还仅仅是个开端，教师队伍的改造还是个艰巨的问题，两种教育思想、两条道路的斗争还需要进一步贯彻到教学活动中去，一定要把学校这一社会主义思想阵地牢牢地掌握在无产阶级的手里。
