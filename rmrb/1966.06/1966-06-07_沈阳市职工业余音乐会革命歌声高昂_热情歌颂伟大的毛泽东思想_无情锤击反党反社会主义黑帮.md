    Shenyang, June 5 (Xinhua) – The amateur singers on the industrial front in Shenyang City recently held a "Workers' Amateur Concert to Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution." With soaring revolutionary songs, they sang out their determination to resolutely defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution, and fight the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang to the end.
    More than 280 workers participated in the concert. Many of them are activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, "Five-Good" workers, and advanced producers, and some of them were performing on stage for the first time.
    The concert began with songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao. The large choir of 120 workers from the Shenyang Blower Factory sang "The East is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China." After each song, the audience erupted in thunderous applause, fully expressing the workers' boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao.
    Enthusiastically praising Mao Zedong Thought, the summit of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, was the theme of the concert. Wang Ying, a female worker from the Shenyang Cement Machinery Factory, sang "Workers Love to Read Chairman Mao's Books." With boundless love for Chairman Mao, she sang: "Workers love to read Chairman Mao's books, their hearts are red and their eyes are bright, and they do not lose their way. They have the motherland in their hearts and a global perspective, and they are confident in thorough revolution. They want to teach mankind to be completely liberated, and sing a song to welcome the rising sun." This song is one of many songs praising Chairman Mao's works created by workers in Shenyang City, and it has been widely circulated among the workers in the city.
    The amateur singers also enthusiastically praised the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune at the concert. Programs such as the female chorus "Long Live the Three Red Banners," the male solo "Striving for Progress" and "I Dedicate Petroleum to the Motherland," and the female solo "The People's Commune is a Golden Bridge" and "Dare to Make the Sun and Moon Shine With New Light" all sang about the great achievements of socialist construction and the unparalleled confidence of the people in the country in adhering to the implementation of the General Line and continuing the Great Leap Forward with full political enthusiasm.
    Songs praising Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Jiao Yulu, as well as songs praising the advanced deeds of Wei Fengying, an advanced female turner in Shenyang City, and Li Suwen, an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, and other worker-peasant-soldier heroes, were also warmly welcomed at the concert.
    The broad masses of workers in factories and enterprises in Shenyang City have enthusiastically responded to the great call of the Party and Chairman Mao and actively participated in the Socialist Cultural Revolution. Recently, in addition to holding rallies to denounce the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang, they have also actively written critical articles, composed poems and paintings, and written songs. According to incomplete statistics, workers have created dozens of songs singing about the Socialist Cultural Revolution. This concert was the first performance of amateur singers actively participating in the Cultural Revolution. They will also hold larger-scale performances.

    参加这次音乐会的有二百八十多名职工。其中很多都是学习毛主席著作的积极分子、五好职工、先进生产者，有些人是第一次登台演唱。
    音乐会在歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌声中开始。沈阳鼓风机厂一百二十名职工组成的大型合唱队演唱了《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和《没有共产党就没有新中国》，每唱完一首，全场就响起暴风雨般的掌声，充分表达了广大工人对党和毛主席的无限热爱。
    热烈歌颂当代马克思列宁主义顶峰的毛泽东思想，是这次音乐会的主题。沈阳水泥机械厂女工王英演唱了《工人爱读毛主席的书》。她怀着对毛主席无限热爱的感情唱道：“工人爱读毛主席的书，心红眼亮不迷路，胸怀祖国放眼全球，彻底革命信心足，要教人类全解放，高歌迎接太阳出”。这首歌是沈阳市工人创作的许多首歌颂毛主席著作的歌曲之一，已经在全市广大工人群众中广泛流传。
    业余歌手们在音乐会上还热烈地歌颂总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗。女声小合唱《三面红旗万万岁》，男声独唱《奋发图强》、《我为祖国献石油》，女声独唱《人民公社是金桥》、《敢教日月换新天》等节目，都以饱满的政治热情，歌颂了社会主义建设的伟大成就以及全国人民坚持贯彻执行总路线，继续大跃进的无比信心。
