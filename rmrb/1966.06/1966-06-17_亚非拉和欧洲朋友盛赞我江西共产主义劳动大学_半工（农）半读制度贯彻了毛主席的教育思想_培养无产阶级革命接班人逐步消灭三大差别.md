　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 15th -- In recent years, many foreign friends have come to Jiangxi Communist Labor University, which practices half-work (farm) half-study, to visit and they have enthusiastically praised the tremendous achievements made by the Communist Labor University as a brilliant victory of Mao Zedong's educational thought.
　　Jiangxi Communist Labor University was founded in 1958 according to Mao Zedong's educational thought. It is a new type of school born in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction in our country, in the midst of the educational revolution. Now, the entire school has one main campus and one hundred and twelve branch campuses, with more than 31,000 students. Since its founding, this school has attracted the interest of many foreign friends. From last year to the present alone, the school has received more than 500 friends from more than 70 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe.
　　After visiting, these foreign friends warmly praised China's half-work half-study education system. Hashimoto Morimasa of the Japan Peace and Friendship Delegation said, "This half-work half-study school is a school that combines theory and practice, learning and labor very well." Arata Natsuko of the Japan Democratic Youth League delegation was delighted when she heard that the students of this school had made great achievements in production practice, saying, "The half-farm half-study education system is good. The close combination of theory and practice can achieve such good results in learning and labor."
　　Many foreign friends believe that the half-work half-study education system of the Communist Labor University is not only useful for China, but also useful for the whole world. An African friend said, "Chinese comrades have found a way to train new-type intellectuals who can engage in both mental and physical labor based on Mao Zedong's educational thought. This path is not only useful for China, but also useful for the world." A Colombian friend said, "Your university is not only an example for China, but also an example for the whole world. It implements Mao Zedong's educational thought."
　　During their visits, when foreign friends heard that the graduates of this school listened to the Party and were able to engage in both mental and physical labor, they praised one after another: With such successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause in China, they can effectively oppose imperialism and modern revisionism, and ensure that the country will never change its color. A friend from Chile said, "I have visited many universities in capitalist and socialist countries, and this is the first time I have seen a new type of university like yours. Your school has implemented Mao Zedong Thought very well. By doing this, you can avoid the emergence of revisionism." A friend from the All-Japan Dormitory Self-Government Association said, "China's half-farm half-study education system promotes the laborization and revolutionization of educated youth, accelerates the elimination of the differences between workers and peasants, the differences between urban and rural areas, and the differences between mental and physical labor, and is a revolutionary measure to ensure that the country will never change its nature. This kind of school is the embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought." Mahabouthi Soryasack of the Lao Trade Union Delegation said, "This kind of half-work half-study school in China is the best school for training and transforming young people, and can cultivate true successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause." Foreign friends also mentioned that this half-work half-study education system, in terms of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, is not only of great significance to China, but also of great significance to the whole world.
　　When introducing the situation to foreign guests, the Communist Labor University said that the school implements the class line in running the school, and more than 80% of the students are children of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres. The school implements diligence and thrift in running the school, and practices half-farm half-study. Students can attend school without spending money, and the school also provides students with a portion of living allowance each month. Foreign friends were very touched after hearing these introductions. A French friend named Raymond who is engaged in education said, "Your school truly serves the majority of people. The children of the broad masses of toiling people in France cannot afford to go to school, and only 3% to 4% of the children of workers and peasants can enroll." Friends from the All-Japan Dormitory Self-Government Association delegation said, "More than 80% of the students at the Communist Labor University are children of workers and peasants, which can only be done in socialist countries. In Japan, due to the control of American imperialism and the oppression of domestic reactionaries, the children of the broad working people cannot get the opportunity to go to school."
　　Many foreign young friends who have not come to Jiangxi to visit have also sent letters praising the introduction of the Communist Labor University from Chinese magazines. Since last year alone, the school has received letters from young friends from more than a dozen countries and regions including Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria, Zanzibar, Japan, and the United Kingdom. A young friend from Nigeria, J. Jiba, wrote in his letter, "I am an ordinary young man from Nigeria. I am very envious of your school and very interested in your half-farm half-study school. Because only your school can train young people to become true revolutionaries."
　　Many foreign friends who have visited the Communist Labor University and have seen the great achievements made here in cultivating proletarian successors have praised it as the result of implementing Mao Zedong's educational thought and the brilliant victory of great Mao Zedong Thought.

    亚非拉和欧洲朋友盛赞我江西共产主义劳动大学
    半工（农）半读制度贯彻了毛主席的教育思想  培养无产阶级革命接班人逐步消灭三大差别
    新华社南昌十五日电　近年来，许多外国朋友来到江西半工（农）半读的共产主义劳动大学参观访问，他们热情地赞扬说，共产主义劳动大学所取得的巨大成就，是毛泽东教育思想的辉煌胜利。
    江西共产主义劳动大学是根据毛泽东教育思想在一九五八年创办的。它是在我国社会主义建设大跃进的形势下，在教育革命中诞生的一所新型学校。现在，全校有总校一所，分校一百一十二所，学生三万一千多人。这所学校创办以来，引起了许多外国朋友的兴趣。仅从去年到现在，这所学校就接待了来自亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和欧洲的七十多个国家五百多位朋友来访。
    这些外国朋友参观访问后，都热烈赞扬中国这种半工半读的教育制度。日本和平友好代表团桥注守正说：“这种半工半读学校是把理论与实践，学习和劳动很好地结合起来的学校。”日本民主青年同盟代表团荒田夏子听到这个学校的学生在生产实践中取得巨大成就时，高兴地说：“半农半读的教育制度就是好，理论与实践紧密结合，才能在学习和劳动上获得这样良好的效果。”
    许多外国朋友认为，共产主义劳动大学这种半工半读的教育制度不仅对中国有用，而且对全世界有用。非洲的一位朋友说：“中国同志根据毛泽东教育思想找到了一条培养既能脑力劳动又能体力劳动的新型知识分子的道路。这条道路不仅对中国有用，对世界也同样有用。”哥伦比亚的一位朋友说：“你们的大学，不仅是中国的一个榜样，也是全世界的一个榜样，它贯彻执行了毛泽东的教育思想。”
    外国朋友在参观访问中，听到这所学校的毕业生听党的话、既能从事脑力劳动又能从事体力劳动时，都纷纷赞扬说：中国有了这样的无产阶级革命事业接班人，就能有力地反对帝国主义和现代修正主义，就能保证国家永远不会变颜色。智利的一位朋友说：“我参观过很多资本主义国家和社会主义国家的大学，我第一次看到你们这样的新型大学。你们这个学校很好地贯彻了毛泽东思想。你们这样做，可以避免产生修正主义。”全日本寮自治会联合会的一位朋友说：“中国的半农半读教育制度促使知识青年劳动化、革命化，加速消灭工农差别、城乡差别、体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，是保证国家永不变质的革命措施。这种学校是毛泽东思想的体现。”老挝工会代表团的马哈布迪·索里亚沙说：“中国这种半工半读的学校是锻炼和改造青年的最好学校，能培养出真正的无产阶级革命事业接班人。”外国朋友们还谈到这种半工半读教育制度，在反修、防修方面，不仅对中国有重大意义，而且对全世界也有重要意义。
    共产主义劳动大学在向外宾介绍情况时说，这个学校贯彻了办学的阶级路线，在校学生百分之八十以上是工人、贫农下中农和革命干部的子女。学校实行勤工俭学、半农半读。学生可以不花钱上学，学校每月还发给学生一部分生活津贴费。外国朋友听了这些介绍后很感动。一位法国从事教育工作的朋友雷蒙说：“你们的学校确实是为大多数人服务的。法国广大劳苦群众的子女是上不起学的，只有百分之三到四的工农子女能入学。”全日本寮自治会联合会代表团的朋友说：“共产主义劳动大学的学生百分之八十以上是工农子女，这只有社会主义国家才能办到。在日本，由于受着美帝国主义的控制和国内反动派的欺压，广大劳动人民的子女是得不到上学机会的。”
    许多没有来江西参观的外国青年朋友，从中国杂志上看到有关共产主义劳动大学的介绍，也纷纷来信赞扬。仅去年以来，这所学校就收到了加纳、坦桑尼亚、尼日利亚、桑给巴尔、日本、英国等十几个国家和地区青年朋友的来信。尼日利亚一位青年朋友J·继巴在信里写道：“我是尼日利亚的一个普通青年，我很羡慕你们的学校，对你们这种半农半读的学校非常感兴趣。因为只有你们这种学校才能把青年培养成为一个真正的革命者。”
    许多到共产主义劳动大学参观和访问过的外国朋友，看到这里在培养无产阶级接班人方面取得的重大成就，都称赞说，这是贯彻执行毛泽东教育思想的结果，是伟大的毛泽东思想的辉煌胜利。
