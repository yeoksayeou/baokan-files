    Resolutely Run Socialist Enterprises According to Mao Zedong Thought
    A New Leap Forward Emerges in China's Steel Industry
    In the first five months of this year, the output of steel, steel products, and pig iron increased substantially compared with the same period last year; more than 250 new varieties of steel products were successfully trial-produced, smashing the blockade of imperialism and revisionism.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 15th) Since the beginning of this year, China's steel industry has resolutely run socialist enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, and has achieved a new leap forward in terms of output, quality, and variety, developing more, faster, better, and more economically.
    Since the beginning of this year, the broad masses of workers and staff in steel enterprises across the country have continued to take class struggle as the key link and have conducted in-depth great debates on giving prominence to politics. Through debate, the broad masses of workers and staff have further understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's teachings that politics is the commander, the soul, and that "political work is the lifeblood of all economic work," and their mental outlook has been completely renewed. They said that to run socialist enterprises well and to develop the metallurgical industry more, faster, better, and more economically, there is ultimately one thing: Chairman Mao's works are the highest instructions for all work, and Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all work. A new upsurge in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works has been set off in steel enterprises across the country. Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the masses, becomes an incomparably powerful material force. Refining iron for the revolution, making steel for the revolution, and making new contributions to the Third Five-Year Plan have become the common determination of steel workers across the country and a powerful driving force for promoting the rapid development of production. The output of steel, steel products, and pig iron produced in the first five months of this year has increased substantially compared with the same period last year, and this year's steel production has been better month by month, showing a sustained increase.
    With the start of the Third Five-Year Plan, the state has put forward many new requirements for the steel industry. The broad masses of steel workers deeply feel their heavy responsibility, and thus invigorate their revolutionary spirit, strive for self-improvement, break through all kinds of old frameworks, boldly innovate, and successfully trial-produce more than 250 new varieties of steel products, further improving China's ability to supply its own steel products and smashing the blockade of imperialism and revisionism against China.
    According to Chairman Mao's instructions to break down superstitions and liberate the mind, China's steel industry is carrying out a product revolution of great significance and far-reaching impact. The new steel grades that have been developed in recent years and can fully utilize China's rich and diverse mineral resources—ordinary low-alloy steel—had an output in the first five months of this year equivalent to seven times the output of the entire last year, and the varieties of steel products made of ordinary low-alloy steel have also greatly increased.
    In the past two years, employees in the national steel industry have greatly focused on mine construction work, providing a material basis for the development of steel industry production this year and the continued leap forward of the steel industry in the future. This year, they have also carried out a series of revolutions in mining and ore dressing methods, accelerating mine construction.
    Mao Zedong Thought is not only the most powerful ideological weapon for the proletariat to conduct class struggle, but also the most powerful ideological weapon to guide the struggle for production and scientific experiments. In recent years, the broad masses of steel workers in China have used Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as weapons, greatly destroyed metaphysics, greatly destroyed the "authority" of bourgeois technology, and created many major technological revolution achievements, such as vacuum smelting, new high-furnace pulverized coal injection technology, new steel rolling technology, comprehensive utilization of symbiotic iron ore, etc., making the technology of China's steel industry production move a big step towards the world's advanced level.
    The practice of technological revolution in the steel industry powerfully proves that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for defeating imperialism, and also a powerful ideological weapon for defeating revisionism and bourgeois "authority." The Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will surely be able to climb the peaks of technology and become the masters in the field of science and technology.

    坚决按照毛泽东思想办社会主义企业
    我国钢铁工业出现新跃进局面
    今年头五个月，钢、钢材、生铁比去年同期大幅度增长；试制成功二百五十多个钢材新品种，粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义的封锁。
    据新华社十五日讯　我国钢铁工业坚决按照毛泽东思想办社会主义企业，今年以来，不论是产量、质量、品种，都获得了多快好省的新跃进。
    全国广大钢铁企业今年以来继续以阶级斗争为纲，深入地进行了突出政治的大辩论。通过辩论，广大职工群众进一步领会了毛主席教导的政治是统帅、是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大意义，精神面貌为之一新。他们说，要办好社会主义企业，要多快好省地发展冶金工业，千条万条，归根到底是一条：毛主席著作是一切工作的最高指示，毛泽东思想是一切工作胜利的根本保证。各地钢铁企业掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。毛泽东思想掌握了群众，就变成了无比强大的物质力量。为革命炼铁，为革命炼钢，为第三个五年计划作出新的贡献，已经成为全国钢铁工人共同的决心，成为推动生产飞快发展的强大动力。今年头五个月生产出的钢、钢材、生铁，都比去年同期有了大幅度的增长，而且，今年的钢铁生产一个月比一个月好，是一个持续增产的形势。
    第三个五年建设计划开始，国家各方面对钢铁工业提出了许多新要求。广大钢铁工人深感自己的责任重大，从而振奋革命精神，奋发图强，破除种种旧框框，大胆创新，试制成功了二百五十多个钢材新品种，进一步提高了我国钢材自给的能力，粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义对我国的封锁。
    根据毛主席破除迷信解放思想的指示，我国钢铁工业正在开展一场意义重大、影响深远的产品革命。近几年发展起来的、能充分利用我国丰富多样矿产资源的新钢种——普通低合金钢，今年头五个月的产量相当于去年全年产量的七倍，普通低合金钢的钢材品种也大大增加。
    全国钢铁工业部门职工近两年来大抓矿山建设工作，为今年钢铁工业生产发展和今后钢铁工业的继续跃进提供了物质基础。今年他们又在采矿选矿方法方面进行了一系列革命，加速了矿山建设。
    毛泽东思想不仅是无产阶级进行阶级斗争的最强大的思想武器，也是指导生产斗争和科学实验的最强大的思想武器。近几年来，我国广大钢铁职工以毛主席的《实践论》和《矛盾论》为武器，大破形而上学，大破资产阶级技术“权威”，创造出许多项重大的技术革命成果，诸如真空冶炼、高炉煤粉喷吹新技术、轧钢新工艺、共生铁矿的综合利用，等等，使我国钢铁工业生产的技术向世界先进水平迈进了一大步。
    钢铁工业技术革命的实践有力地证明：毛泽东思想是战胜帝国主义的强大思想武器，也是战胜修正主义和资产阶级“权威”的强大思想武器。被毛泽东思想武装起来的我国工人阶级，一定能够攀登技术高峰，成为科学技术领域里的主人。
