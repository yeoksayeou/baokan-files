"Voice of the Thai People" Radio Supports Emergency Meeting of Asian-African Writers
Condemns Soviet Revisionists for Sabotaging Asian-African Writers' Movement and Serving U.S. Imperialism

New China News Agency, June 28th: Bangkok News: "Voice of the Thai People" Radio broadcasted a commentary on the 25th, fully supporting the emergency meeting of Asian-African writers held in Beijing on the 27th, and condemning the Soviet revisionists' sabotage activities that split the Asian-African writers' movement.

The commentary pointed out that the purpose of this emergency meeting is to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, to study the tasks of Asian-African writers in opposing imperialism and neo-colonialism's cultural aggression, and to develop the national cultures of Asian-African countries. Progressive and revolutionary writers in Asia and Africa will further unite through this meeting and strengthen their fighting power on the cultural front against imperialism and neo-colonialism.

The commentary said that for this reason, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices are very afraid of this meeting and are doing everything they can to obstruct and sabotage it. The Soviet revisionists, who have already betrayed the Asian-African people's revolution, not only refused to participate in this meeting but also held a split "permanent bureau meeting of Asian-African writers" in Cairo on June 19th, attempting to weaken the fighting power of Asian-African writers united against imperialism and colonialism and sabotage the emergency meeting of Asian-African writers in Beijing. The Soviet revisionists' actions more clearly exposed their ugly face. The commentary expressed resolute opposition to the Cairo meeting planned by the Soviet revisionists, pointing out that it is a split meeting and is completely serving U.S. imperialism.

The commentary said that Thai patriotic and just writers fully support the emergency meeting of Asian-African writers held in Beijing and sincerely wish this meeting a complete success.

    “泰国人民之声”电台支持亚非作家紧急会议
    谴责苏修破坏亚非作家运动为美帝效劳
    新华社二十八日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台二十五日发表评论，全力支持二十七日在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，并谴责苏联修正主义者破坏亚非作家运动的分裂活动。
    评论指出，这次紧急会议的目的是支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，研究亚非作家在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的文化侵略中应负的任务和发展亚非各国的民族文化。亚非进步的、革命的作家将通过这一次会议进一步联合起来，并加强他们在文化战线上反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的战斗力。
    评论说，正因为这样，美帝国主义和它的同伙对这次会议十分害怕，千方百计地加以阻挠和破坏。已经背叛亚非人民革命的苏联修正主义者除了拒绝参加这次会议外，还于六月十九日在开罗召开了分裂的伪“亚非作家常设局会议”，企图削弱亚非作家联合反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的战斗力，破坏在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议。苏联修正主义者这种行径更清楚地暴露了它的丑恶面目。评论表示坚决反对苏联修正主义者策划的开罗会议，指出这是一个分裂的会议，它完全是为美帝国主义效劳的。
    评论说，泰国的爱国、爱正义的作家全力支持在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，并衷心祝贺这次会议获得圆满成功。
