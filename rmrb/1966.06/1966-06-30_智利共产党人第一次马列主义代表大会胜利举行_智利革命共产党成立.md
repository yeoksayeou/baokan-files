	To make a revolution, one must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and revolutionary style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its lackeys. _All Revolutionary Forces of the World, Unite to Oppose Imperialist Aggression!_
