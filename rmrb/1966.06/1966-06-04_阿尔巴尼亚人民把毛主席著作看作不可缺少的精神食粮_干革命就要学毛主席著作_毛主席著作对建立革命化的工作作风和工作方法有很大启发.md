    Currently, in Albania, one can see Chairman Mao's writings everywhere, in bookstores, in libraries, or in offices. The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," along with the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, are prominently displayed on bookshelves, in display windows, or on desks. The vast number of Albanian readers read the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" with reverence. Chairman Mao's writings such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and books such as "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art," have received an extremely warm welcome. Some writers and artists read "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" before going to factories and rural areas in order to better go deep into reality, connect with the masses, and better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Not long ago, the Vlora District made a report to cadres, soldiers, and youth introducing the main content of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to help everyone study Chairman Mao's writings. Guro Zeneli, First Secretary of the Vlora District Committee of the Labor Youth League, underlined the main points and aphorisms of Chairman Mao when studying the book "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art" in order to use Chairman Mao's words to educate young people. He told reporters: "Mao Zedong is not only Chinese, he also belongs to all mankind. We make revolution for all mankind, so of course we must study Chairman Mao's writings." On the bookshelf in the office of Petro Çiruna, Secretary of the Propaganda and Education Department of the Vlora District Committee, there is a complete set of the Albanian version of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Çiruna told reporters that when we study Chairman Mao's articles such as "Methods of Work of Party Committees" and "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," we read, think, discuss, and check at the same time. Chairman Mao's instructions in these articles are of great inspiration and help to us in establishing a revolutionary style of work and working methods.
