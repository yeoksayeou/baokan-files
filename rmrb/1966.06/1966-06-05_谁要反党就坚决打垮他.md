    Our faculty and students resolutely support Comrade Nie Yuanzi and others' revolutionary actions in daring to despise all bourgeois "authorities" and exposing their attempts to lead the life-and-death class struggle into a debate of "pure academics" and "pure theory." We are determined to unite with you, rally around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and drag out all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. No matter what banner they fly, no matter how high their position or how old their qualifications, as long as they oppose the Party and socialism, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely, thoroughly, and completely crush them.

    谁要反党就坚决打垮他
    我院师生坚决支持聂元梓等同志敢于藐视一切资产阶级“权威”和揭破他们妄图把你死我活的阶级斗争，引向“纯学术”、“纯理论”之争的革命行动。我们坚决同你们一道，团结在党中央、毛主席的周围，把一切反党反社会主义分子，统统抓出来，不论他们打着什么旗号，不管他们职位多高，资格多老，只要他们反党反社会主义，反对毛泽东思想，我们就坚决、彻底、全部地打垮他们。
