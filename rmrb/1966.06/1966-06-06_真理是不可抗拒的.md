    Truth is Irresistible
    Xiang Donghui

    Human beings live on Earth. Is the Earth flat or round, stationary or rotating? In ancient and medieval times, people's understanding of this question was very naive and laughable. The Greeks said that the Earth was held on the shoulders of the god Atlas. The Egyptians said that the Earth was placed on the backs of four elephants, the elephants stood on turtles, and the turtles floated on the sea. The Bible told people: "God created everything," which is "eternal truth," and no one is allowed to doubt it.

    More than four hundred years ago, the outstanding Polish scientist Copernicus raised the banner of modern science and challenged the theology that had ruled Europe for more than a thousand years. His work, "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres," explained the principle that the Earth revolves around the sun. Copernicus' theory brought about a revolution in astronomy, and it also encountered the fanatical attacks and opposition of the church. Subsequently, Italian astronomers Bruno and Galileo were, because they spread the teachings of Copernicus, one was burned alive on the cross by the Roman Pope, and one was imprisoned. "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres" was listed as a banned book.

    However, the truth cannot be strangled by shackles, butcher knives, or a piece of paper. Science finally defeated theology with its incomparable power. Today, who still believes that the Earth is not rotating?

    Truth has class character. What the reactionary class regards as truth, the revolutionary class considers fallacy. What the revolutionary class considers truth, the reactionary class regards as heresy. Lenin once said: "If geometric theorems were to contradict the interests of people, then people would certainly try to refute them." Major inventions or discoveries in the field of natural science are used by the reactionary ruling class if they are beneficial to them; if they are detrimental to the reactionary ruling class, they are destroyed. As for the field of social science, the struggle is even more acute and intense. The maintainers of the old system always regard revolutionary theories that reflect the objective laws of social development and guide people's struggles as monstrous floods and beasts, and try every means to contain and extinguish them. This is the fate of Marxism.

    Marx first put forward his theory in 1844. Four years later, in the book "The Communist Manifesto," co-authored with Engels, it began like this: "A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police." With the development of the international communist movement, the reactionary forces did not merely "exorcise" but used bloody violence to deal with the revolutionary struggle. In 1871, the French bourgeoisie suppressed the uprising of the Paris Commune with unparalleled brutal massacres. At that time, the anti-revolutionary chieftain Thiers wrote such a proclamation in a bloodthirsty tone: "Paris is covered with corpses. It should be believed that this terrible sight will serve as a lesson to those insurgents who dare to proclaim their support for the Commune." Although this revolutionary movement failed, the theory of scientific socialism was not strangled by the executioners. In less than fifty years, the October Revolution achieved a glorious victory under the guidance of this revolutionary theory. Today, this revolutionary theory of Marxism has been regarded by the revolutionary people of the world as an ideological weapon for seeking their own complete liberation.

    For more than a hundred years, Marxism has not only struggled against the persecution of reactionary forces, but also against all kinds of opportunist and revisionist trends of thought. When the "Communist Manifesto" was published, Marxism did not occupy a dominant position in the workers' movement. At that time, it was only one of countless socialist factions or trends of thought. Marx and Engels engaged in fierce debates with feudal, bourgeois, and petty-bourgeois "socialist" factions, finally defeating those heterodox ways and constantly enriching and perfecting their own theories. Lenin inherited the fighting tradition of Marx and Engels, carried out resolute struggles against the Second International revisionism represented by Bernstein and Kautsky, and all kinds of opportunism, and advanced Marxism to a new stage, namely the stage of Leninism.

    The spread of Marxism-Leninism in China and the emergence and victory of Mao Zedong Thought have also gone through tortuous and complex struggles. For nearly a hundred years, China's advanced figures once went to the Western bourgeoisie to find the truth, but the things they learned failed one after another. The salvo of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism, which changed the face of China. However, for Marxism-Leninism to truly achieve victory in China, it had to go through a process of combining with China's specific reality. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the product of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific reality of China. The emergence of Mao Zedong Thought in China truly provided the compass and guarantee for leading the Chinese revolution to victory. However, this truth of Mao Zedong Thought was not recognized and accepted by all comrades in the Party and the people of the whole country from the very beginning. Before the Zunyi Conference in 1935, the Party's leading organs, opposing the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, committed right-leaning opportunist errors and "left"-leaning opportunist errors, which brought great losses to the Chinese revolution. The whole Party drew the conclusion from practice: violating Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution would suffer setbacks; acting in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution would achieve victory after victory. After establishing Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership position in the Party, the Chinese revolution moved from one victory to another.

    Mao Zedong Thought is not only the most precious spiritual wealth of the Chinese people, but also the common spiritual wealth of the revolutionary people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and the highest and most vital Marxism-Leninism. It is the most powerful weapon against imperialism, the most powerful weapon against all reactionaries, and also the most powerful weapon against modern revisionism. The influence of Mao Zedong Thought has long exceeded China's borders. The broad masses of oppressed nations and oppressed people in the world, the broad masses of revolutionaries and advanced figures, all regard Mao Zedong Thought as the beacon guiding them to victory.

    Just as the reactionary forces in Europe more than a hundred years ago formed a "holy alliance" to "exorcise" the "specter" of communism, now, imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries have formed a new "holy alliance," attempting to "exorcise" the "specter" of great Mao Zedong Thought. The reactionary bourgeois representatives and all the ghosts and monsters in China have also colluded to slander and attack Mao Zedong Thought in every possible way. However, in front of Mao Zedong Thought, in front of the hundreds of millions of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, these heroes who oppose Mao Zedong Thought have been battered and bruised one after another, and have fallen one after another. No matter in the past, present, or future, no matter at home or abroad, no matter who it is, anyone who wants to be an enemy of Mao Zedong Thought can only suffer a shameful defeat. Mao Zedong Thought has such great power because it is an unshakeable truth, it is a truth grasped by hundreds of millions of people. Truth is irresistible. Mao Zedong Thought is irresistible. No force can stop Mao Zedong Thought from moving from victory to victory, just as it is impossible to stop the Earth's rotation, just as it is impossible to stop the sun from rising in the east!

    真理是不可抗拒的
    向东辉
    人类生活在地球上。地球，究竟是扁的还是圆的，是静止的还是旋转的？在古代以至中世纪，人们对这个问题的认识是十分幼稚和可笑的。希腊人说，地球负在阿特拉斯神的肩头上。埃及人说，地球放在四只象背上，象立在龟上，龟浮在海上。《圣经》则告诉人们：“上帝创造一切”，这是“永恒的真理”，不容任何人怀疑。
    四百多年前，杰出的波兰科学家哥白尼首举近代科学的旗帜，向统治欧洲一千多年的神学挑战。他的著作《天体运行》，阐述了地球围绕太阳旋转的原理。哥白尼的学说，带来了天文学上的革命，同时也遭到了教会的狂热的攻击和反对。随后，意大利天文学家白鲁诺和伽利略，因为传播哥白尼学说，一个被罗马教皇活活烧死在十字架上，一个被幽禁。《天体运行》则被列为禁书。
    然而，真理是不可能用镣铐、屠刀或一纸禁令来加以扼杀的。科学终于以它无可比拟的力量，战胜了神学。今天，有谁还相信地球不是在转动的呢？
    真理是有阶级性的。反动阶级奉为真理，革命阶级认为是谬论。革命阶级认为是真理，反动阶级看作是邪说。列宁曾经说过：“如果几何学定理触犯了人们的利益，那末人们也一定要把它推翻的。”自然科学领域内的重大发明或发现，要是对反动的统治阶级有利，它们就予以利用；要是对反动的统治阶级不利，它们就加以摧残。至于在社会科学领域内，那么，斗争更是无比地尖锐和剧烈。旧制度的维护者，总是把反映社会发展客观规律、并指导人们进行斗争的革命学说，视如洪水猛兽，千方百计地要把它遏制和扑灭。马克思主义的遭遇，就是如此。
    马克思最初提出自己的学说，是在一八四四年。四年之后，在他和恩格斯合著的《共产党宣言》一书中，一开始便是这样写的：“一个幽灵，共产主义的幽灵，在欧洲徘徊。旧欧洲的一切势力，教皇和沙皇、梅特涅和基佐、法国的激进党人和德国的警察，都为驱除这个幽灵而结成了神圣同盟。”随着国际共产主义运动的发展，反动势力就不仅是“驱除”，而是以血淋淋的暴力手段来对付革命斗争了。一八七一年，法国资产阶级以无比残暴的屠杀，镇压巴黎公社的起义群众。当时的反革命头目梯也尔，以嗜血成性的口吻写下了这样的文告：“巴黎遍地堆满了尸体。应当相信，这种可怕的景象将成为胆敢宣称拥护公社的起义者们的教训”。这一革命运动虽然失败了。但是，科学社会主义学说，并没有被刽子手扼杀。不到五十年，十月革命就在这一革命学说的指导下，取得了光辉的胜利。今天，马克思主义这一革命学说，已被全世界革命人民看作是谋求自身彻底解放的思想武器。
    一百多年来，马克思主义不仅同反动势力的迫害作斗争，并且同形形色色的机会主义和修正主义思潮作斗争。在《共产党宣言》发表时，马克思主义并没有在工人运动中占有统治地位。它在当时只不过是无数社会主义派别或思潮之一而已。马克思和恩格斯同封建的、资产阶级的和小资产阶级的“社会主义”流派展开了激烈的论战，终于击败了那些旁门邪道，并使自己的学说不断地丰富和充实起来。列宁继承了马克思和恩格斯的战斗传统，同伯恩施坦、考茨基等为代表的第二国际修正主义和形形色色的机会主义进行了坚决的斗争，把马克思主义推进到一个新的阶段，即列宁主义的阶段。
    马克思列宁主义在中国的传播，毛泽东思想的产生和胜利，同样是经过曲折复杂的斗争的。近百年来，中国的先进人物曾经向西方资产阶级去寻找真理，但是他们学到的东西，都一个又一个地失败了。十月革命一声炮响，送来了马克思列宁主义，才使中国的面貌起了变化。但是，马克思列宁主义要真正在中国取得胜利，还必须经过一个同中国的具体实际相结合的过程。伟大的毛泽东思想，就是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国的具体实际相结合的产物。中国产生了毛泽东思想，才真正有了把中国革命引向胜利的指针和保证。但是，毛泽东思想这个真理，也不是一开始就为全党同志和全国人民所认识、所接受的。在一九三五年遵义会议以前，党的领导机构，反对以毛泽东同志为代表的正确路线，犯过右倾机会主义的错误，也犯过“左”倾机会主义错误，给中国革命带来了极大的损失。全党从实践中得出了这样的结论：违背毛泽东思想，革命就要遭到失败；按照毛泽东思想办事，革命就会节节胜利。在确立了毛泽东同志在党内的领导地位之后，中国革命就从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民最宝贵的精神财富，也是全世界革命人民的共同的精神财富。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。它是反对帝国主义的最强大武器，是反对一切反动派的最强大武器，也是反对现代修正主义的最强大武器。毛泽东思想的影响，早已超出中国的国界。世界上广大的被压迫民族和被压迫人民，广大的革命者和先进人物，都把毛泽东思想看作是他们走向胜利的灯塔。
    正同一百多年前欧洲反动势力为“驱逐”共产主义的“幽灵”而结成“神圣同盟”一样，现在，帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派结成了一个新的“神圣同盟”，妄想“驱逐”伟大的毛泽东思想的“幽灵”。中国国内的反动资产阶级代表人物和一切牛鬼蛇神也勾结起来，千方百计地诽谤和攻击毛泽东思想。但是，在毛泽东思想面前，在由毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万人民面前，这些反对毛泽东思想的好汉们一个又一个地碰得头破血流，一个又一个倒了下去。不论过去、现在和将来，不论国内和国外，不论是什么人，凡是要同毛泽东思想为敌的，都只能遭到可耻的惨败。毛泽东思想所以具有这么大的威力，就是因为它是颠扑不破的真理，它是为亿万人民所掌握的真理。真理是不可抗拒的。毛泽东思想是不可抗拒的。任何力量都不可能阻挡毛泽东思想从胜利走向胜利，正同不可能阻挡地球的自转，不可能阻挡太阳从东方升起一样！
