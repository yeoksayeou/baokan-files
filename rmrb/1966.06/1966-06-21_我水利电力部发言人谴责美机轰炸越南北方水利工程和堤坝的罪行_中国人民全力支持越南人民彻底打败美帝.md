    Xinhua News Agency, June 20th – The spokesperson of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on the 20th, strongly condemning the towering crime of US imperialism in dispatching aircraft to attack water conservancy projects and dams in North Vietnam, and expressing resolute support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against US aggression and for national salvation, and full support for the Vietnamese people in thoroughly defeating the US aggressors. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    US imperialism is frantically increasing its dispatch of aircraft to attack water conservancy projects and dams in North Vietnam. From February to May this year alone, US aircraft have bombed various water conservancy projects in North Vietnam more than 500 times, including 49 times on dams. Especially recently, US imperialism has continued to expand its bombing of various dams in North Vietnam. We, all Chinese water conservancy workers, severely condemn and resolutely protest this towering crime of US imperialism.
    The heroic people of South Vietnam have highly developed the power of people's war, defeating the US aggressor troops and winning one glorious victory after another. The soldiers and civilians of North Vietnam have also achieved brilliant results in the battle to fiercely annihilate US air bandits. The victory of the Vietnamese people has boosted the morale of revolutionary people all over the world, and greatly deflated the arrogance of the US imperialist paper tiger.
    Faced with this helpless defeat, US imperialism is doing its utmost to employ its counter-revolutionary dual tactics, on the one hand using the blackmail of expanding the war to promote its conspiracy of "peace talks," and on the other hand using the smoke screen of "peace talks" to cover up the crime of expanding the war. The US aggressors' frantic bombing of water conservancy projects in North Vietnam, besides demonstrating its weakness and dead end, is an attempt to intimidate the Vietnamese people in order to realize its insidious schemes. But US imperialism's wishful thinking is always bound to fail, and this fascist towering crime will absolutely not scare the heroic Vietnamese people. On the contrary, it can only further arouse the strong hatred and more resolute resistance of the Vietnamese people, further arouse the unparalleled anger of the people of the world, thoroughly expose its conspiracy of false peace talks and real war expansion, and accelerate the fate of the aggressors' defeat.
    Chinese water conservancy workers, together with the entire Chinese people, steadfastly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against US imperialist aggression, to defend the North, liberate the South, and reunify the motherland, and fully support the Vietnamese people in thoroughly defeating the US aggressors.
    The Vietnamese people will surely win!
    US imperialism is bound to be defeated!

    我水利电力部发言人谴责美机轰炸越南北方水利工程和堤坝的罪行
    中国人民全力支持越南人民彻底打败美帝
    新华社二十日讯　中华人民共和国水利电力部发言人二十日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义派遣飞机袭击越南北方水利工程和堤坝的滔天罪行，并且表示坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国正义斗争，全力支持越南人民彻底打败美国侵略者。声明全文如下：
    美帝国主义正在疯狂地增派飞机袭击越南北方水利工程和堤坝。仅从今年二月到五月，美国飞机对越南北方各个水利工程的轰炸就达五百次以上，其中轰炸堤坝达四十九次。特别是在最近，美帝国主义还在不断扩大对越南北方的各个堤坝的轰炸。我们全中国水利工作者严厉谴责和坚决抗议美帝国主义的这一滔天罪行。
    英雄的越南南方人民高度发挥了人民战争的威力，把美国侵略军打得落花流水，取得了一个又一个的光辉胜利。越南北方军民在痛歼美国空中强盗的战斗中也取得了辉煌的战果。越南人民的胜利长了全世界革命人民的志气，大大地灭了美帝国主义纸老虎的威风。
    美帝国主义在这无可奈何的败局面前，正在极力施展其反革命的两手策略，一面用扩大战争的讹诈来推行其“和平谈判”的阴谋，一面又用“和平谈判”的烟幕来掩盖扩大战争的罪行。美国侵略者疯狂地轰炸越南北方水利工程，除了表现它的虚弱和穷途末路以外，就是企图恫吓越南人民，以实现其阴谋诡计。但是美帝国主义的如意算盘，总是要落空的，它的这种法西斯滔天罪行，绝对吓不倒英雄的越南人民。恰恰相反，只能更加激起越南人民的强烈仇恨和更坚决的反击，更加激起全世界人民的无比愤怒，彻底地戳穿它假和谈真扩大战争的阴谋，加速侵略者失败的命运。
    中国水利工作者和全中国人民一道，坚定不移地支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫北方、解放南方和统一祖国的正义斗争，全力支持越南人民彻底打败美国侵略者。
    越南人民必胜！
    美帝国主义必败！
