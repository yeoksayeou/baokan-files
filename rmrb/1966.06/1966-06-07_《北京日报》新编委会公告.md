    Announcement of the New Editorial Board of "Beijing Daily"
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th—"Beijing Daily" published the "Announcement of the New Editorial Board of 'Beijing Daily'" today. The full text of the announcement is as follows:
    After the CCP Central Committee wisely reorganized the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee immediately made a decision to establish a new editorial board for "Beijing Daily" and "Beijing Evening News." We announce with boundless excitement: "Beijing Daily" and "Beijing Evening News" are reborn! This is yet another new victory for the great Mao Zedong Thought.
    "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" formerly degenerated into tools for the former key leaders of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee to promote a revisionist line and carry out capitalist restoration, becoming tools of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party, anti-socialist counter-revolutionary clique. These three newspapers and periodicals once spread a large amount of poison, frantically attacking our Party and the socialist system, shielding bourgeois rightists, and attacking proletarian leftists; deceiving the people and suppressing the criticisms of the broad masses of readers. This small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements blatantly resisted the Party Central Committee's line and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, vainly attempting to bring this great revolutionary movement into the orbit of revisionism. After their conspiracy was exposed, they fabricated a great deception and conspiracy on April 16th, a fake criticism and real cover-up, a fake struggle and real protection, a "sacrifice the pawn to save the general" scheme. They opposed Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought while waving the red flag against the red flag, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought.
    The worker-peasant-soldier masses and other revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have sharp eyes and have long been aware of and resisted the conspiracies and tricks of this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist guys. Since May 8th, when our Party and the people publicly exposed their conspiracy, brother newspapers and periodicals across the country, the worker-peasant-soldier masses, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and the majority of the employees of this newspaper who were willing to make revolution, launched a fierce attack with the force of a thunderbolt and the momentum of a commanding height, everywhere condemning in speech and writing, angrily denouncing, and quickly exposed this gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to the full light of day.
    In the past two or three days, encouraged by the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution, Beijing has presented a scene of jubilation. Many factories, suburban rural areas, organs, schools, troops, and shops have held meetings to celebrate the victory. This has greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and greatly diminished the prestige of the bourgeoisie and all ghosts and monsters. Facts have once again proven that in front of the people led by the great Communist Party of China, no matter who dares to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, they will inevitably be badly battered.
    When the newborn "Beijing Daily" and "Beijing Evening News" meet the readers today, we solemnly declare:
    We will certainly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instruction for all our work, and also as the supreme instruction for running the newspaper, resolutely run these two newspapers as the proletarian fighting Party newspaper, and forever struggle to promote Mao Zedong Thought and defend Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the worker-peasant-soldier masses and the broad masses of the people to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and make greater contributions in socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    We will certainly hold high the great banner of the proletarian Cultural Revolution, stand closely with the people of the city and the country, stand closely with brother newspapers and periodicals across the country, actively participate in this great revolutionary movement, thoroughly expose the ugly faces of bourgeois representatives who oppose the Party and oppose socialism, thoroughly smash the attacks of bourgeois black gangs, use the great Mao Zedong Thought and the great communist spirit to inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and carry this Cultural Revolution, which is related to the fate and future of the Party and the country, through to the end.
    We will certainly resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instruction of running the newspaper by the whole Party, rely on the broad masses of worker-peasant-soldiers and all revolutionary cadres and revolutionary intellectuals, resolutely face the worker-peasant-soldiers, serve the worker-peasant-soldiers wholeheartedly, run "Beijing Daily" and "Beijing Evening News" well, make it full of the fighting voices of the worker-peasant-soldier masses, and always be full of vitality.
    Dear readers, the people of this city and the country, under the leadership of the Party, have already achieved new victories in the great proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, this is only the first step we have taken in the struggle. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, fully recognize the long-term, acute, and complex nature of class struggle, resolutely advance victoriously, and sweep away all ghosts and monsters. The tasks of struggle before us are still glorious and arduous. "The majestic pass is really like iron, but now we are stepping forward from the beginning." We are full of confidence that with the wise leadership of the great Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the correct guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the supervision and enthusiastic support of the people of the city and the country, we will certainly be able to stand at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and resolutely charge forward!
    Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever and ever fly on the position of "Beijing Daily" and "Beijing Evening News"!
                          June 6, 1966

    《北京日报》新编委会公告
    新华社六日讯　《北京日报》今天刊登了《北京日报新编委会公告》。公告全文如下：
    在中共中央英明地改组了北京市委之后，新的北京市委立即作出决定，成立《北京日报》《北京晚报》新编委会。我们怀着无限兴奋的心情宣告：《北京日报》《北京晚报》新生了！这是伟大的毛泽东思想的又一个新胜利。
    《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》，过去堕落成为前北京市委一些主要负责人推行修正主义路线、进行资本主义复辟的工具，成为“三家村”反党反社会主义的反革命集团的工具。这三个报刊曾经散布大量的毒素，疯狂地攻击我们的党和社会主义制度，包庇资产阶级右派，打击无产阶级左派；蒙蔽人民群众，压制广大读者的批评。这一小撮反党反社会主义分子明目张胆地抗拒党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的路线和方针，妄图把这一场伟大的革命运动纳入修正主义的轨道。当他们的阴谋败露之后，又在四月十六日，制造了一个假批判、真掩护，假斗争、真包庇，“舍车保帅”的大骗局、大阴谋。他们打着红旗反红旗，披着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的外衣反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众和其他革命人民的眼睛是雪亮的，对这一小撮反党反社会主义家伙的阴谋诡计，本来早有觉察和抵制。自五月八日起，当我们党和人民群众，公开揭露了他们的阴谋之后，全国各兄弟报刊，各地的工农兵群众、革命干部、革命知识分子，以及本报大多数愿意革命的职工，以雷霆万钧之力，高屋建瓴之势，展开猛烈进攻，到处口诛笔伐，愤怒声讨，很快地就把这一伙反党反社会主义分子暴露在光天化日之下。
    近两三天，在文化革命大好形势鼓舞下，北京市呈现一片欢腾景象。许多工厂、郊区农村、机关、学校、部队、商店，纷纷集会，庆祝胜利。这就大大长了无产阶级志气，大大灭了资产阶级以及一切牛鬼蛇神的威风。事实再次证明，在伟大的中国共产党领导的人民面前，不管什么人，如敢反党反社会主义，必将碰得头破血流。
    当新生的《北京日报》《北京晚报》今天和读者见面的时候，我们郑重宣告：
    我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛主席的书当作我们各项工作的最高指示，也当作办报的最高指示，坚决把这两个报纸办成无产阶级的战斗的党报，永远为宣传毛泽东思想、捍卫毛泽东思想而斗争，推动工农兵群众和广大人民，用毛泽东思想武装自己，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，做出更大的贡献。
    我们一定高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，同全市和全国人民紧紧站在一起，和全国各兄弟报刊紧紧站在一起，积极参加这场伟大的革命运动，彻底揭露资产阶级代表人物的反党反社会主义的丑恶面目，彻底粉碎资产阶级黑帮的进攻，用伟大的毛泽东思想、伟大的共产主义精神，激发劳动人民的革命热情，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把这场关系到党和国家命运和前途的文化大革命进行到底。
    我们一定坚决贯彻执行毛主席指示的全党办报的方针，依靠广大工农兵群众和一切革命干部、革命的知识分子，坚决面向工农兵，全心全意地为工农兵服务，把《北京日报》《北京晚报》办好，使它充满工农兵群众的战斗声音，永远生气勃勃。
    亲爱的读者们，本市和全国人民，在党的领导下，已经在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，取得了新的胜利。但是，这还只是我们在斗争中迈出的第一步。我们要牢记毛主席的教导，充分认识阶级斗争的长期性、尖锐性、复杂性，坚决乘胜前进，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。我们面前的斗争任务，仍然是光荣的艰巨的。“雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越”。我们满怀信心地认为，有伟大的党中央、毛主席的英明领导，有毛泽东思想的正确指引，有全市人民和全国人民对我们的监督和热情支持，我们一定能够站到无产阶级文化大革命的最前列，坚决地冲锋陷阵！
    让毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远地、永远地飘扬在《北京日报》《北京晚报》这个阵地上！
                          一九六六年六月六日
