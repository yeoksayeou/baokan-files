    According to Xinhua News Agency, Kabul: Mrs. Bahija Masoud of the Afghan Women's Association, who recently visited China, said that the Chinese people love Chairman Mao, listen to Chairman Mao, and take Chairman Mao's words as their code of conduct. She said that the Chinese people are very hardworking, brave, consciously laboring, sincere, and simple.
    China's cultivation and education of children is excellent, and they are growing up well. They all love Chairman Mao and listen to Chairman Mao.
    Mrs. Saliha Farouk Etemadi, President of the Afghan Women's Association, said at the banquet: The Chinese people are hardworking and upright. Everyone works actively, and everyone has food and clothing.
    Mrs. Hafiza Hassan, editor of the Afghan Women's Magazine, said that we were very surprised to see the 12,000-ton hydraulic press made in China during our visit to Shanghai. When Chinese workers were building the hydraulic press, they studied Chairman Mao's article "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and finally overcame difficulties to successfully manufacture it.
    Mrs. Hassan said that the path China is taking is a path of genuine development.
