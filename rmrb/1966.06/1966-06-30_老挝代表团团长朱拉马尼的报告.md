	Old Challenging American Imperialism’s Aggression in Laos, Vietnam, and Other Countries in Indochina

	UPI June 29th - Today, at the emergency meeting of the Asian-African Writers' Association, Udom Khattigna, head of the Lao delegation, strongly condemned American imperialism for expanding its aggression in Laos, Vietnam, and other countries in Indochina. He said that the Lao people, who are currently fighting, firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Supporting Vietnam is supporting our own struggle.

	Udom Khattigna said that American imperialism has trampled on the 1954 Geneva Agreement regarding the Vietnam issue and committed countless barbaric and inhumane crimes in Vietnam. However, the heroic and indomitable Vietnamese people have dealt devastating blows to the American bandits and their lackeys, achieving glorious victories. The victory of the Vietnamese people shows the world that the American aggressors, who appear strong on the surface, are actually weak in reality.

	When discussing the situation of the Lao people's anti-American struggle, Udom Khattigna said that under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao patriotic military and people have dealt heavy blows to American imperialism both politically and militarily. However, American imperialism will not abandon their aggressive ambitions. In the past two years, American imperialists have pushed their war of aggression in Laos further. While using mercenaries and Thai troops, they have also sent the U.S. Air Force to continuously intensify the bombing of Lao liberated areas. He said that American imperialism wants to use these unforgivable brutal methods to conquer the Lao people. But they are greatly mistaken. The more vicious the enemy, the deeper the hatred of the Lao people, and the more determined the people are to make the enemy pay in blood.

	He said that the desperate American imperialists are plotting new, extremely dangerous military adventures. They are intensifying and expanding "special warfare" in Laos and plan to send ground troops to directly occupy central and southern Laos, inciting their lackeys in Thailand and South Vietnam to intensify provocations against the Kingdom of Cambodia. These actions and plots of American imperialism are part of their plan to expand the war of aggression in Indochina and to try to extricate themselves from their irredeemable predicament in this region of the world.

	He said that in the face of the new dangerous plots of American imperialism, the Lao people have never been as determined as they are now. They are resolved to fight to the end until they thoroughly frustrate the aggressive plots of American imperialism. The Lao people's determined stance is reflected in the declaration of the 1965 Lao National Political Consultative Conference, which determined the four-point stance and five solutions for resolving the Lao issue. He expressed his belief that with the unity of the Lao nation, with the close cooperation of the peoples of Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia in their struggle against the common enemy, and with the enthusiastic support of the people of the world, the Lao people's struggle against American imperialist aggression will surely achieve final victory and will realize a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos.

### 老挝代表团团长朱拉马尼的报告

    老挝代表团团长朱拉马尼的报告
    新华社二十九日讯　老挝代表团团长乌达马·朱拉马尼今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上，强烈谴责美帝国主义扩大侵略老挝、越南和印度支那其他国家。他说，正在战斗的老挝人民坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争；支持越南也就是支持了自己的斗争。
    朱拉马尼说，美帝国主义践踏一九五四年有关越南问题的日内瓦协议，在越南犯下了无数的最野蛮的和最不人道的罪行。但是，英雄的不屈不挠的越南人民给予美国强盗及其仆从以毁灭性的打击，取得了辉煌的胜利。越南人民的胜利向全世界表明，美国侵略者表面上强大，而实际是虚弱的。
    乌达马·朱拉马尼谈到老挝人民反美斗争的情况时说，在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，老挝爱国军民在政治上和军事上给了美帝国主义以沉重打击，但是美帝国主义不会放弃他们的侵略野心。近两年来，美帝国主义者又把他们侵略老挝的战争向前推进一步。他们在使用雇佣军和泰国军队的同时，派遣了美国空军，不断加紧轰炸老挝的解放区。他说，美帝国主义想用这些不可饶恕的残暴手段来征服老挝人民。但是他们大错特错了。敌人越凶残，老挝人民的仇恨就越深，人民就越坚决地要敌人偿还血债。
    他说，走投无路的美帝国主义，正阴谋进行新的极端危险的军事冒险。他们在老挝加紧并扩大“特种战争”，还要派地面部队直接占领中下寮，唆使其泰国和南越的仆从加紧对柬埔寨王国进行挑衅。美帝国主义的这些行动和阴谋活动，是扩大侵略印度支那战争和妄图摆脱它在世界这个地区不可挽回的困境的计划的一部分。
    他说，面临着美帝国主义新的危险的阴谋活动，老挝人民从来没有象现在这样坚决，他们决心要把斗争进行到底，直到彻底挫败美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。老挝人民这种坚决的立场反映在一九六五年老挝全国政治协商会议的宣言里，宣言确定了关于解决老挝问题的四点立场和五项解决办法。他表示相信，有了老挝民族的团结，有了老挝、越南和柬埔寨三国人民在反对共同敌人斗争中的密切配合，在世界人民的热情支持下，老挝人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争必将取得最后胜利，必将会实现一个和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和富强的老挝。
