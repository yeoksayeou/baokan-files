    Using Mao Zedong Thought to Arm Our Minds, Serving as Propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought
    A Soldiers' Amateur Performing Arts Troupe Continues to Advance in Class Struggle Over Fourteen Years
    Resolutely Implementing Chairman Mao's Literary and Art Direction
    On the coast of the Yellow Sea, there is a literary and artistic mobile team, praised by soldiers as a "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team." This is the soldiers' amateur performing arts troupe of a certain regiment of the Jinan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This troupe, composed of twelve soldiers, was established based on the great Mao Zedong Thought. For fourteen years, they have unswervingly implemented Chairman Mao's literary and art direction, firmly occupying the proletarian cultural front. In the struggle of the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution, they reviewed the path they have traversed over the past fourteen years and resolved to hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sweeping away all monsters and demons in the literary and art circles, and occupying all cultural fronts.

    Occupying the Proletarian Cultural Front with Mao Zedong Thought
    In 1952, this regiment was stationed on the coast. Due to inconvenient transportation, the soldiers rarely saw movies or dramas. Occasionally, when a professional troupe came, they mostly performed plays about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. The soldiers said, "This is not what we need. What we need are plays that can inspire revolutionary fighting spirit." The regimental Party committee believed that revolutionary soldiers should receive revolutionary education of proletarian ideology at all times and in all places, and that capitalist and feudalist ideologies must not be allowed to erode our minds and wear down our revolutionary will. They decided to establish their own literary and artistic team.

    Thus, the soldiers' amateur performing arts troupe of this regiment was born. Some people, seeing these soldiers with rifles on their backs and musical instruments in their hands, said, "They are so unsophisticated, what can they accomplish?" Their derision could not shake the soldiers' determination. They said, "The land was cultivated by us, the factories were built by us, and culture is also created by us. It is precisely us, these unsophisticated people, who overthrew the three great mountains and established the people's regime. We can be the masters of the country, so why can't we be the masters of culture!" Based on the situation and tasks at the time, they created and performed programs such as "Settling Down on the Coastal Defense Line" and "I Defend the Coastal Defense for the Motherland." After the performances in the companies, they were welcomed by the soldiers, who said, "It sings what is in our hearts! It will definitely work if we continue to perform like this!" The soldiers' encouragement further strengthened their confidence and boosted their courage.

    Through studying Chairman Mao's works, they further realized that in order to make literature and art a better weapon for serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for serving proletarian politics, they must produce their own works, promote Mao Zedong Thought, and use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the proletarian cultural front. Therefore, these soldiers, who had never composed music or written plays, broke the view of the mystery of creation and bravely created their own works. Meng Xianzhang, who had no knowledge of music composition, studied diligently and mastered some composition knowledge in a short period of time. He composed "Bayonet Song," which reflected the soldiers' hatred condensed on the tips of their bayonets and their courage to fight to the death. It was widely circulated in the army. Meng Xianzhang's composing skills also continuously improved in creative practice. From 1963 to the present, he has created more than ten revolutionary musical pieces that praise Mao Zedong Thought and reflect the fiery struggle life of the company. Huang Zhenkang, who had never touched a musical instrument, has mastered the skill of playing the sheng through hard practice in recent years. When he started learning the sheng, some people heard that he had no musical foundation and said, "It's difficult to learn the sheng without a musical foundation, it will take at least two years!" Huang Zhenkang thought to himself, I am learning the sheng not for fun, but to use it to serve the class struggle. No matter how difficult it is, I must learn it and master it as soon as possible. He only took two weeks to play four songs, including "Socialism is Good," for the soldiers.

    Now, most of the members of this performing arts troupe can create programs and can skillfully master two to four musical instruments. In the past fourteen years, they have performed more than 300 programs, of which 197 were created by themselves.

    Relying on Mao Zedong Thought to Defend the Proletarian Cultural Front
    After the establishment of this small performing arts troupe, relying on the great Mao Zedong Thought, it resolutely withstood the erosion of various bourgeois ideologies and defended the proletarian cultural front.

    Two years ago, some people said that the problem of the literary and art direction of the army has been solved, and now the main thing is to improve artistic level and skills, vainly attempting to oppose Mao Zedong's literary and art thought with this. This fallacy once had some influence on them. In order to pursue the so-called artistic effect, they forcibly added some jokes with no political significance to the programs. When the leading cadres of the army discovered this trend, they believed that although these problems were manifested in form, they were essentially a struggle between two literary and art ideologies and two literary and art lines. They organized everyone to restudy Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and examined and criticized these problems in the spirit of rectification. This made everyone realize that our army does not live in a vacuum, and the bourgeois literary and art ideology in society will inevitably be reflected in the army. As long as there is class struggle, the literary and art direction will always need to be rectified. Otherwise, literature and art will deviate from the direction of serving proletarian politics and deviate from the track of Mao Zedong Thought. They further cleaned up some old frameworks, old habits, and old styles in previous performances. They believed that without thoroughly breaking these old things, the new literature and art of the proletariat could not be established. They broke the old frameworks and changed the old habits, creating and performing some new programs that were both highly ideological and had the atmosphere of army life. When they participated in a large-scale literary and art performance with their newly created performance singing "The More We Sing, the Happier We Are," which reflected the growth of soldiers under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, and the percussion quick-rhyme "On the Winter Training Ground," which reflected the revolutionary spirit of soldiers who were not afraid of hardship and death, some so-called art experts whispered behind their backs: "Soldiers performing soldiers is very ordinary," "No voice, just shouting." Some even viciously summarized their performance in one sentence: "Bayonets, drums, and yelling." Hearing these cold criticisms, some team members were shaken. But the vast majority of people said: "Take the program to the companies and listen to the soldiers' reactions before drawing a conclusion." When they performed in the companies, each program was warmly welcomed. The soldiers said: "The performance is good, fighting must have this kind of tigerish strength!" The masses in the驻地驻地 said: "Such an army, how can it not win battles!" The same program had two completely different reactions, which opinion was correct? They studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" again with this question. Chairman Mao said: "Our literature and art are all for the masses of the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's teachings made them more clearly discern the direction; the soldiers' reaction made them more firmly believe in literature and art serving proletarian politics and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They said: With Chairman Mao's teachings pointing the way, and the soldiers' reaction as the standard, we will never lose our way! This performing arts troupe is like this, relying on Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon, repelling the erosion of bourgeois literary and art ideology time and time again. With each struggle, everyone's thinking has also improved.

    Relying on Mao Zedong Thought to Consolidate and Develop the Proletarian Cultural Front
    In their performance practice, they deeply realized that as proletarian literature and art, it must highlight politics and promote Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can the literary and artistic weapon truly play the role of "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy"; only in this way can the proletarian cultural front be fundamentally consolidated and developed.

    The members of this performing arts troupe are mostly children of poor and lower-middle peasants. They love the Party the most, love Chairman Mao the most, love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, and regard promoting and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their fighting task. They carry rifles on their shoulders, backpacks on their backs, and regardless of wind and rain, without fear of severe cold, they traverse every position and every beachhead in the defense area, promoting and praising Mao Zedong Thought with fiery class feelings. They have successively created a large number of programs such as "The Great Helmsman," "Chairman Mao's Works are Treasures among Treasures," and "Soldiers Love to Read Chairman Mao's Books." They enthusiastically sang: "Chairman Mao's works are the sun, shining brightly in the hearts of soldiers, holding the gun tightly in our hands, there is no obstacle on the revolutionary road." They adapted the deeds of activists in the whole regiment studying Mao Zedong Thought into programs and performed them in the whole regiment. Whatever the army does, they perform it, so that literary and artistic performances closely cooperate with the central work of the army. In the movement to create four-good companies, they created and performed "Holding High the Red Banner to Create Four-Good," "Singing Praises of the Four-Good Cooking Squad," "Comparing, Learning, Catching Up, Helping, and Matching Pairs Red," etc.; when the army conducts class education, they adapted "A Soldier's Family History" based on the family history of the company's soldiers and "Crows All Over the World are Black" exposing the crimes of the landlord, etc. These programs, which were written based on real people and real events in the company and reflected the fiery struggle life of the company, were deeply welcomed by the vast number of cadres and soldiers. The soldiers praised the performing arts troupe as the "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team" and the performing members as "Mao Zedong Thought Propagandists."

    用毛泽东思想武装头脑  当毛泽东思想的宣传员
    一支战士业余演出队十四年来在阶级斗争中不断前进
    坚定不移地贯彻毛主席的文艺方向
    在黄海边，有一支被战士誉为“毛泽东思想宣传队”的文艺轻骑兵，这就是中国人民解放军济南部队某团战士业余演出队。这支由十二名战士组成的演出队，是靠伟大的毛泽东思想建立起来的。十四年来，他们坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的文艺方向，巩固地占领了无产阶级的文化阵地。在社会主义文化大革命的斗争中，他们回顾了十四年走过的道路，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，横扫文艺界一切牛鬼蛇神，占领所有的文化阵地。
    靠毛泽东思想占领无产阶级文化阵地
    一九五二年，这个团驻防到海边，由于交通不便，战士很少看到电影、戏剧，有时偶而去个专业剧团，演出的也大都是帝王将相、才子佳人的戏。战士们说：“这不是我们需要的，我们需要的是能够鼓舞革命斗志的戏。”团党委认为：革命战士应该时时处处受到无产阶级思想的革命教育，决不能让资本主义、封建主义思想侵蚀我们的头脑，消磨我们的革命意志。他们决定建立自己的文艺队伍。
    这个团的战士业余演出队就这样诞生了。有的人看到这些肩背步枪，手拿乐器的战士，说：“土里土气的，能搞出个啥名堂？”讥笑动摇不了战士们的决心，他们说：“土地是我们开出来的，工厂是我们建起来的，文化也是我们创造的，就是我们这些土里土气的人，推翻了三座大山，打下了人民江山，国家的主人我们都能做，难道就不能做文化的主人！”他们根据当时的形势、任务，编演了《海防线上把家安》、《我为祖国守海防》等节目，在连队演出以后，受到战士的欢迎，都说：“唱出了我们的心里话！照这样演下去准行！”战士们的鼓励，更加坚定了他们的信心，鼓足了勇气。
    他们又通过大学毛主席著作，进一步认识到，要使文艺这个武器更好地为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，就必须搞出自己的作品来，宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想去占领无产阶级文化阵地。于是，这些从来没有作过曲，写过剧的战士，打破创作神秘的观点，勇敢地创作自己的作品。一无作曲知识的孟宪章，苦学钻研，在很短时间里就掌握了一些作曲知识，创作出了一支反映战士把仇恨凝结在刺刀尖上，敢于刺刀见红的《刺刀歌》，在部队中广泛流传。孟宪章的作曲水平，也在创作实践中不断提高，从一九六三年到现在，先后创作了十多支歌颂毛泽东思想、反映连队火热斗争生活的革命乐曲。从来没有摸过乐器的黄振康，近年来经过一番苦练，熟练地掌握了吹笙技巧。当他开始学笙时，有人听说他没有一点音乐基础，就说：“没有音乐基础，想学笙难呀，起码得花上两年！”黄振康心想，我学笙不是为了玩玩，而是拿它来为阶级斗争服务，不管有多大的困难，也要尽快地学会它、掌握它。他仅仅用了两个星期，就给战士们演奏《社会主义好》等四支乐曲。
    现在这个演出队的大部分队员都能创作节目，并能熟练地掌握二至四种乐器。十四年来，他们演出了三百多个节目，其中自己创作的就有一百九十七个。
    靠毛泽东思想坚守无产阶级文化阵地
    这支小小的演出队成立后，依靠伟大的毛泽东思想，坚决顶住了各种资产阶级思想侵蚀，守住了无产阶级文化阵地。
    前两年有人说，军队的文艺方向问题已经解决，现在主要是提高艺术水平和技巧了，妄想以此来反对毛泽东文艺思想。这种谬论，一度对他们也有所影响。为了追求所谓艺术效果，在节目中，生拉硬凑地加上了一些毫无政治意义的笑料。部队领导干部发现了这个苗头，认为这些问题虽然表现在形式上，但实质上是两种文艺思想、两条文艺路线的斗争，就组织大家重新学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，以整风的精神检查批判这些问题。使大家认识到，我们军队并不是生活在真空里，社会上的资产阶级文艺思想必然要反映到军队内部来，只要有阶级斗争存在，文艺方向就永远需要端正。不然，文艺就会脱离为无产阶级政治服务的方向，脱离毛泽东思想的轨道。他们又进一步清理了以往演出中的一些旧框框、旧习惯、旧作风。认为不彻底破除这些旧的东西，无产阶级的新文艺就树立不起来。他们就大破旧框框，大改旧习气，编演了一些既有高度思想性，又有部队生活气息的新节目。当他们带着新创作的反映战士在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的表演唱《越唱越高兴》，反映战士一不怕苦二不怕死革命精神的锣鼓快板《冬训场上》等节目，参加一次规模较大的文艺会演时，一些所谓懂得艺术的人就在背后议论：“兵演兵，很稀松”，“没嗓子，干喊”。有的还恶毒地把他们的演出概括为一句话：“刺刀、锣鼓、加咋呼。”听了这些冷讽热嘲，个别队员有些动摇了。但绝大多数人说：“把节目拿到连队中去，听听战士们的反映，再做结论。”当他们在连队演出时，每个节目都受到热烈欢迎。战士们说：“演得好，打仗就得有这种虎劲！”驻地群众也说：“这样的军队，那能不打胜仗！”同样的节目，有着两种截然不同的反映，哪种意见对？他们带着这个问题，又学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。毛主席说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”毛主席的教导，使他们更加明辨了方向；战士们的反映，使他们更加坚定了文艺为无产阶级政治服务为工农兵服务的信心。他们说：有毛主席的教导指路，有战士们的反映做标准，我们就永远不会迷失方向！这个演出队就是这样，靠毛泽东思想这个强大的武器，一次又一次地打退了资产阶级文艺思想的侵蚀，每经过一次斗争，大家的思想也随着提高一步。
    靠毛泽东思想巩固、发展无产阶级文化阵地
    在演出实践中，他们深刻认识到，作为无产阶级的文艺，必须突出政治，宣传毛泽东思想，只有这样，文艺武器才能真正起到“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的作用；也只有这样，无产阶级的文化阵地，才能从根本上得到巩固和发展。
    这个演出队的队员，大都是贫下中农子弟。他们最热爱党，最热爱毛主席，最爱读毛主席的书，又把宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想，当作自己的战斗任务。他们肩扛步枪，身背背包，不畏风雨，不惧严寒，踏遍防区的每块阵地，每个滩头，以火热的阶级感情，宣传毛泽东思想，歌颂毛泽东思想。他们先后编出了《伟大的舵手》、《毛主席著作是宝中宝》、《战士爱读毛主席的书》等大批节目。他们热情地唱道：“毛主席著作是太阳，照得战士心里亮，紧紧握住手中枪，革命路上无阻挡。”他们把全团学习毛主席著作积极分子的事迹编成节目，在全团演出。部队干什么，他们就演什么，使文艺演出紧密配合部队的中心工作。在创造四好连队运动中，他们编演了《高举红旗创四好》、《歌唱四好炊事班》、《比学赶帮对对红》等；部队进行阶级教育时，他们又根据连队战士的家史编演了《一个战士的家史》和揭露地主罪恶的《天下乌鸦一般黑》等节目。这些根据连队真人真事编写的、反映连队火热斗争生活的节目，深受广大干部、战士们的欢迎，战士称赞这个演出队是“毛泽东思想的宣传队”，称演出队员是“毛泽东思想的宣传员”。
