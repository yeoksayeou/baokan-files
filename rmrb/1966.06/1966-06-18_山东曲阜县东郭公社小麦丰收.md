    The cadres and members of the Dongguo Commune in Qufu County, Shandong Province, have firmly grasped Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon and waged a tenacious struggle against severe drought, resulting in a bumper wheat harvest. All of the commune's more than 8,800 mu of wheat have been harvested, and trial threshing indicates that the average yield per mu for the commune will increase by 50 to 60 percent compared to last year.
    The cadres and members of the Dongguo Commune all said: This year's general wheat harvest is the result of studying Chairman Mao's writings. Studying Chairman Mao's books has given people revolutionary thoughts and actions, enabling them to overcome difficulties one by one in the face of severe drought and achieve high yields. They do not forget the country, the Party, and Chairman Mao in their harvest. Based on the principle of "first the country, then the collective, then the individual," the production teams correctly handle the relationship between the three and, after reserving enough seeds and rations for the commune members, are preparing to overfulfill this year's annual grain sales task in one go during the wheat season.

    山东曲阜县东郭公社小麦丰收
    山东省曲阜县东郭公社的干部和社员，紧紧掌握毛泽东思想这一强大武器，同严重的干旱进行顽强的斗争，使小麦获得丰收。全公社的八千八百多亩小麦已经全部收割完毕，试打的情况表明，这个公社的小麦平均亩产量将比去年增长百分之五六十。
    东郭公社的干部和社员都说：今年小麦的普告丰收，是学习毛主席著作的结果。学了毛主席的书，才使人们有了革命化的思想和行动，才能在严重干旱情况下，克服一个个困难，夺得了高产量。他们丰收不忘国家、不忘党和毛主席，各生产队本着先国家后集体、再个人的原则，正确处理三者关系，在留足种子和社员口粮之后，准备在麦季一次超额完成今年全年的粮食交售任务。　（据新华社）
