    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. Amidst the vigorous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Shenyang are displaying an extraordinary surge of revolutionary spirit. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they are simultaneously engaging in verbal and written attacks, vehemently criticizing and repudiating the anti-Party, anti-socialist black gangs; and exerting their utmost revolutionary drive and intelligence, actively taking on heavy burdens, and striving to fulfill the production tasks assigned to them by the state.

    People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest and most intelligent. The workers of Shenyang said: "As long as we have Mao Zedong Thought, any miracle on earth can be created." Numerous facts prove that they are neither speaking empty words nor boasting. The 220,000 kVA giant transformers that China could not produce in the past are now being produced; the precision rotor pumps needed by the chemical industry, the infinitely variable speed motors needed by the textile and paper industries, and the oil gauging and gas measuring instruments needed by the petroleum industry are now being manufactured; the high-vacuum Roots pumps and first-class precision balances urgently needed by scientific research departments are now also being successfully trial-produced.

    According to statistics from relevant departments, the number of new products successfully trial-produced by workers throughout the city from January to May this year is more than the total for the entire year of last year. At the same time, the quality of the products they produced this year has improved significantly, and output and labor productivity have increased substantially.

    The excellent production situation that has emerged on the industrial front in Shenyang this year has been driven by the upsurge of workers throughout the city eagerly studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of workers study and apply what they learn in the struggle, learning a little and applying a little, and the more they learn, the greater their enthusiasm. They have turned the activity of uncovering the lid of backward production into a movement of refusing to lag behind, catching up quickly, and striving to catch up with and surpass advanced levels at home and abroad.

    Shenyang City is shouldering very heavy production tasks this year. Many factories, on the one hand, have to substantially increase output and variety, improve labor productivity, and reduce costs; on the other hand, they have to transfer equipment and technical backbone personnel to support the construction of fraternal cities. Faced with such arduous tasks, the workers of Shenyang did not flinch and bravely took on the heavy burden. They said heroically: Production requires conditions, but conditions are dead, and people are alive. As long as we have Mao Zedong Thought, bad conditions can be turned into good conditions, and if there are no conditions, they can be created. In the great discussion on the relationship between politics and professional work, the broad masses of workers used many vivid facts to criticize various erroneous ideas and practices that emphasized professional work while slighting politics and saw things but not people. Everyone realized that Shenyang, as an old industrial base, had much better conditions than fraternal cities, but the better the conditions, the more dependent they were on ideas, and they could not see the subjective initiative of people. Through the vigorous study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, the leaders of many factories highlighted politics, achieved ideological revolutionization, actively mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, organized the masses, and waged struggles against various difficulties, resulting in a thriving scene in production.

    This year, the state required the Shenyang Water Pump Factory to increase production tasks by 20% and double the variety. At first, some leading cadres sat in the office and calculated everything to a dead end, and no matter how they calculated, the tasks could not be arranged. The more they calculated, the more difficult it became. Later, they submitted a plan to the leadership department to invest in purchasing equipment. After they used Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and truly mobilized the masses, the workers manufactured twenty-two sets of high-efficiency special-purpose equipment and two production linkage lines on their own, which not only doubled production efficiency but also saved manpower and a large amount of metal materials. In this way, not only did they not ask the state for equipment, but they also extracted some precision equipment and technical strength to support fraternal factories.

    In the past, the copper electrolysis workshop of the Shenyang Smelting Plant always believed that the quality of its products could not keep up with Shanghai, mainly because its equipment was not as good as others. It went to Shanghai to study seven times, but gained nothing. This year, through uncovering the lid of backward production and launching a major debate on the relationship between politics and professional work, this workshop found that the fundamental reason for its past backwardness was the failure to highlight politics and the failure to see people. Later, it resolutely took the mass line, believing in the masses and relying on the masses. As a result, the electrolytic cells that were previously considered unable to be repaired and unusable became electrolytic cells that could be repaired and used, and the experiences that were previously considered impossible to promote became good experiences. The equipment was still the same equipment, but once people's thinking changed, the quality of products improved significantly, greatly narrowing the gap with advanced units.

    Facts once again eloquently prove the great truth that "spirit can be transformed into matter." People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the decisive factor in developing production. In the first five months of this year, Shenyang City achieved a total of more than 15,000 major technical innovations, manufactured more than 1,400 sets of various special-purpose equipment, and reformed more than 200 kinds of old equipment. From January to April alone, more than 300 new products were successfully trial-produced, with an average of three new products born every day.

    Another manifestation of the great upsurge of revolutionary spirit among the broad masses of workers in Shenyang City is: they have discarded the word "fear" and established the word "dare," dare to surpass and create, dare to compete with bourgeois technical "authorities," and dare to blaze their own path in technology. Some technical personnel, management personnel, and enterprise leading cadres who have been bound by foreign frameworks for a long time have deeply realized that if they do not break foreign dogmas and foreign frameworks, if they do not put the word "dare" first, and if they do not base themselves on "surpassing," they will always crawl behind others. Since the beginning of this year, many factories have successively implemented the three-in-one combination of workers, technicians, and cadres, on the one hand, vigorously carrying out design reforms of old products and thoroughly transforming the structure of old products, making many products that were copied from foreign designs undergo a complete transformation; on the other hand, vigorously carrying out experimental research and creating many new products with Chinese characteristics.

    Recently, the person in charge of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in analyzing the excellent situation on the industrial production front, pointed out that Shenyang's industrial production this year is better than any previous year, but this is only a good start. Compared with fraternal cities and compared with the needs of the country, we are still backward and must continue to rise up and catch up.

    活学活用毛主席著作热潮推动生产高潮
    沈阳市工业战线产量和品种大幅度增加
    新华社沈阳十六日电　在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，沈阳工业战线广大职工的革命斗志异常昂扬。他们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，一面口诛笔伐，痛击反党反社会主义黑帮；一面发挥自己最大的革命干劲和聪明才智，积极挑重担，努力完成国家交给自己的生产任务。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最勇敢、最聪明的人。沈阳职工们说：“只要有了毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。”许许多多的事实证明，他们既不是说空话，也不是吹大牛。过去我国不能生产的二十二万千伏安的巨型变压器，现在他们生产出来了；化学工业需要的精密罗杆泵，纺织、造纸等工业需要的无级变速电机，石油工业需要的量油测气仪，现在他们制造出来了；科学研究部门急需的高真空罗茨泵、一级精密天平等等，现在他们也都试制成功了。
    据有关方面统计，今年全市职工在一至五月份试制成功的新产品，比去年全年的总和还多；同时，他们今年生产的产品，质量显著提高，产量和劳动生产率大幅度增长。
    今年沈阳工业战线上出现的生产大好形势，是全市职工如饥如渴地活学活用毛主席著作的热潮推动起来的。广大职工带着问题，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，学一点用一点，越学干劲越大。他们把揭生产落后盖子的活动变成了一个不甘落后，急起直追，迎头赶上和超过国内外先进水平的运动。
    沈阳市今年担负的生产任务很繁重。许多工厂一方面要大幅度增加产量、品种，提高劳动生产率和降低成本，另方面还要抽调设备和技术骨干支援兄弟城市建设。在这样繁重的任务面前，沈阳市职工毫不畏缩，勇敢地挑起了重担。他们豪迈地说：生产是要条件的，但是条件是死的，人是活的，只要有了毛泽东思想，不好的条件可以变好，没有条件可以创造。广大职工在政治与业务关系的大讨论中，用许多活生生的事实，批判了过去那种轻政治重业务，见物不见人的各种错误思想和作法。大家认识到沈阳这个老工业基地，论条件比兄弟城市好得多，可是条件越好越有依赖思想，看不见人的主观能动作用。通过活学活用毛主席著作，许多工厂领导突出了政治，做到了思想革命化，他们积极发动群众，依靠群众，组织群众，向各种困难进行了斗争，使生产出现了一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    今年国家要求沈阳水泵厂增加生产任务百分之二十，品种增加一倍。开始，有的领导干部坐在办公室里算死账，怎么算任务也安排不下去，越算越困难，后来向领导部门提出了一个要投资购置设备的计划。当他们用毛泽东思想挂了帅，把群众真正发动起来之后，工人们自己动手制造了二十二台高效率的专用设备和两条生产联动线，既成倍地提高了生产效率，又节约了人力和大量的金属材料。这样不仅没有向国家要设备，反而还抽出了一部分精密设备和技术力量支援了兄弟工厂。
    沈阳冶炼厂铜电解车间过去一直认为产品质量赶不上上海，主要原因是设备不如人家，曾七次赴上海学习，一无所得。今年，这个车间通过揭生产落后盖子，开展政治与业务关系大辩论，找到过去落后的根本原因是没有突出政治，见物不见人。后来，坚决地走群众路线，相信群众，依靠群众，结果过去被认为不能修、不能用的电解槽，变成了既能修又能用的电解槽，把过去认为不能推广的经验变成了好经验。设备还是这些设备，人的思想一变，产品质量就有了显著提高，大大缩小了同先进单位的差距。
    事实再一次雄辩地证明，“精神变物质”这一伟大的真理。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是发展生产的决定性因素。今年头五个月，沈阳市共实现了一万五千多项重大的技术革新，制造了一千四百多台各种专用设备，改革了二百多种老设备。仅一到四月份，就试制成功了三百多种新产品，平均每一天就有三种新产品诞生。
    沈阳市广大职工革命精神大振的另一个表现是：打掉了“怕”字，树立了“敢”字，敢超敢创，敢于和资产阶级技术“权威”较量，敢于在技术上闯自己的路。一些受洋框框束缚较久的技术人员、管理人员和企业领导干部深深体会到：不打破洋教条、洋框框，不是“敢”字当头，不立足于“超”，就要永远跟着人家后边爬行。今年以来，许多工厂纷纷实行工人、技术人员和干部三结合，一面大搞老产品设计改革，彻底改造老产品的结构，使得许多仿照外国设计的产品脱胎换骨，一面大搞试验研究，创造了许多具有中国风格的新产品。
    最近，中共沈阳市委负责人在分析工业生产战线上的大好形势时指出，沈阳市今年工业生产比过去任何一年都好，但是这仅仅是一个良好的开端，同兄弟城市比、同国家的需要比，我们还是落后的，还要继续奋起直追。
