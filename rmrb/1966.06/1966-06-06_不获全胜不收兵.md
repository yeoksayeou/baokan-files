    No Victory, No Retreat
    Dai Liren, Baishui Commune, Pingliang County, Gansu

Us poor and lower-middle peasants regard the people's property as our home,
We keep Chairman Mao's words in our hearts.
We must firmly hold the knife handle,
We will never let go of the seal handle,
And we must also grasp the pen handle.
Conquering mountains and battling waters, fighting heaven and earth,
Subduing dragons and tigers, fighting jackals and wolves,
We will fight all reactionaries.
Prepare for struggle, have no illusions,
Dedicate our lives to revolution and fighting.
We must listen to the Party,
And arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought.
Unfazed by storms and waves,
We must defend the truth, defend the Party,
And not allow the enemy to run wild.
We must strike down the enemy with guns,
And we won't let go of the enemy without guns.
We must eliminate imperialism,
We must bury revisionism,
And sweep away all monsters and demons.
We must resolutely fight, fight fiercely,
Fight until the enemy surrenders their guns.
We must resolutely fight, fight fiercely,
Fight until the enemy capitulates.
We will not retreat without complete victory.

    不获全胜不收兵
    甘肃平凉县白水公社　戴立人咱贫下中农把家当，毛主席的话儿记心上，刀把子我们要握紧，印把子我们决不放，笔杆子我们也要掌。征山战水斗天地，降龙伏虎打豺狼，凡是反动的我们就打，准备斗争不幻想，干一辈子革命打一辈子
  仗。我们要听党的话，用毛泽东思想来武装，惊涛骇浪不动摇，要捍卫真理捍卫党，不允许敌人逞疯狂。带枪的敌人要把他打倒，不带枪的敌人咱也不放，帝国主义我们要消灭，修正主义我们要埋葬，要把牛鬼蛇神一扫光。要坚决地打，狠狠地打，打到敌人交了枪，要坚决地打，狠狠地打，打到敌人投了降，不获全胜我们不收场。
