    Recently, the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of the Huangshandong Brigade, Shiba Commune, Boluo County, Guangdong Province, an advanced unit in studying Chairman Mao's works, held multiple forums. With boundless love for Chairman Mao and unparalleled indignation towards anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, they powerfully refuted the "Three-Family Village" black gang's attacks on Mao Zedong Thought and vehemently denounced the fallacies of so-called "authorities" who slanderously claimed that workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works was "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism."

    Without Studying Chairman Mao's Works, One Doesn't Understand Revolution

    Poor peasant female commune member Zhang Laijiao said: That bunch of villains like Deng Tuo and those bourgeois "authorities" viciously attacked Mao Zedong Thought and opposed us listening to Chairman Mao's words and reading Chairman Mao's books. They are truly wolves in sheep's clothing! Chairman Mao's words speak to our hearts, every sentence of them, we love listening to Chairman Mao's words the most. Chairman Mao said that without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. I understand that if the poor and lower-middle peasants don't study Chairman Mao's works, they won't understand revolution. Before liberation, we poor peasants suffered miserably. My grandfather and father begged for three generations. My grandfather had his eyes gouged out by the landlord and was fed to the dogs on the spot. I was sold to a landlord as a servant girl at the age of six, and then sold to Huangshandong at the age of twenty. All day long, I carried loads and burned charcoal, eating hard rice heads (tuber fleeceflower) and monkey brother ferns (wild plants) year-round, so hungry that I was sallow and weak. When my husband died of illness, there was no coffin; he was buried wrapped in a tattered mat. After my husband died, I was left with six children, without support, lacking food and clothing, and had to sell my children. In the old society, seven layers of stone slabs and seven layers of bricks pressed down on us; we couldn't turn ourselves around. Thanks to Chairman Mao for leading us to turn over, dividing the land, dividing the houses, and our lives are getting better day by day. Our present lives are like white sugar mixed with honey, sweeter and sweeter. How can I not listen to Chairman Mao's words! To listen to Chairman Mao's words, you have to read Chairman Mao's books. Thinking about the past, comparing it to the present, the more I study Chairman Mao's books, the more I love studying them. Deng Tuo and those "authorities" attack Mao Zedong Thought, telling us poor peasants not to listen to Chairman Mao's words, not to read Chairman Mao's books, I will resolutely fight them to the end.

    Old guerrilla fighter and militia platoon leader of the forest farm, Tian Jinmin, said: In the past, we didn't have our own guns and suffered the oppression and exploitation of the reactionaries. Thanks to Chairman Mao for leading us, establishing the country, grasping political power, and having our own armed forces. I will diligently study Chairman Mao's works, hold the gun in my hand tightly, defend the three red banners, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

    Poor peasant female commune member Qiu Zhuying said: Chairman Mao is our great savior, always thinking of us poor peasants. Chairman Mao's words are true, every word is sweet. I am old, have a bad memory, and am illiterate. When I first started learning, I had many difficulties. The tutor taught me "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." After listening to Chairman Mao's words, I made up my mind, overcame all difficulties, studied diligently, and firmly remembered Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao said: The enemy with guns has been eliminated, but there are still enemies without guns. If we don't fight them, the Kuomintang will come back, and we will be trampled under the feet of these bad guys again, and suffer exploitation and oppression.

    Forest farm director Gu Shijin said: Chairman Mao's works are the highest instructions for all our work. We cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought for a moment. If we are separated, we will make mistakes. When we were engaged in land reform, cooperation, and communization, we all listened to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely relied on the poor peasants. However, in 1963, some of our cadres forgot Chairman Mao's words, forgot the class line, and their class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants weakened. In production, they did not rely on them but relied on the upper-middle peasants, so production was not done well. Later, we studied Chairman Mao's works and realized the importance of what Chairman Mao said, "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution." We relied closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and production was done well. In 1964 and 1965, the output increased greatly. This made us realize that only by always listening to Chairman Mao's words, not forgetting the poor and lower-middle peasants, and not forgetting class struggle, can we guarantee that we will not make mistakes at any time and in any place.

    Party branch secretary Tian Huagui said: We poor peasants, to completely turn ourselves around, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words and read Chairman Mao's books. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for us to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction. Before 1962, our brigade suffered from natural disasters. At this time, the landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to sabotage, saying: "Huangshandong has high mountains and cold water, barren land and poor people, there is no way to change it." The commune members were very uneasy. Later, our cadres and commune members studied Chairman Mao's theory on class struggle and articles such as "Serve the People." Chairman Mao's teachings enhanced our confidence and courage, and everyone was determined to change Huangshandong into a "Golden Cave." According to Chairman Mao's instructions, we grasped class struggle, exposed and criticized the sabotage behavior of landlords and rich peasants, and helped some cadres correct their capitalist thinking, and carried out remembering the bitterness and thinking about the sweetness. Finally, we overcame the difficulties and achieved great success. We poor and lower-middle peasants, to make revolution, we must study Chairman Mao's works, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

    Ideology Changes, Customs and Habits Change

    Production team leader Li Shijin said: There is a middle peasant in our team, Ma Guanmei, who is the mother of six children. She understands that in the past poor women were bound by thousands of ropes and shackles, and it was Chairman Mao who liberated them. She has always insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works. She often says: "Studying Chairman Mao's works is to transform oneself. If you study without transforming your ideology, it's still a waste of time!" After studying the viewpoint of "utter devotion to others without any thought of self," she examined and corrected the shortcomings of her past attendance, such as being picky about easy tasks and fearing hard work, and not handing over good fertilizer to the production team. Opening holes in the mountains to plant tung trees is the hardest work, and she rushes to do it, sometimes going to work even when she is sick. Old commune member Li Hanqing has no one to fetch water, and she helps him fetch it. She used to quarrel with others often, causing disunity. After studying Chairman Mao's works, she realized that she should be extremely enthusiastic towards her class sisters and corrected this shortcoming. After studying Chairman Mao's works, she has completely changed. Those bourgeois "authorities" nonsense that our study of Chairman Mao's works is "simplification." These gentlemen deliberately make revolutionary theory so mysterious to scare us and prevent us from studying, so that their reactionary junk can be sold. This is a dream!

    Qiu Zhuying said: We poor and lower-middle peasants study Chairman Mao's works not like you "authorities" who do it to put on a show and do bad things; but to act and behave according to Chairman Mao's words. In the past, I was unwilling to do things that didn't give me any advantage. When the production team dried grain in front of my house, I wouldn't collect it when it rained because I thought I wouldn't get work points. I ignored comrades who came to find cadres, because I thought cold water had to be carried, firewood had to be burned for hot water, there are thousands of people who come and go, I can't manage that much. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," my thinking changed, and I felt that it was meaningless to live in this world just for eating and wearing. Chairman Mao said that we should be people who are beneficial to the people. I will do as Chairman Mao said. I do whatever I see on ordinary days. When I see it raining, I will rush back to help collect the grain no matter how far away I am; when comrades come to find cadres, I will help them find them, and also boil water for them to drink. I think they are doing it for the revolution, and I am also doing it for the revolution when I help them.

    Poor peasant commune member Tian Jin said: We poor peasants suffered a lot under the rule of the landlord class in the past. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I understood that it is meaningful to be like Bethune and Zhang Side. I used to be a warehouse keeper. When the warehouse leaked and the grain seeds sprouted, I was criticized by the team leader, and I wanted to quit. Only after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" did I feel that it was not right. We must learn from Comrade Bethune's "extreme responsibility for work, and extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people." After harvesting the rice and distributing rations, the commune members were busy with work and had no time to carry the grain, so I carried the grain to the commune members' homes and helped them hang it upstairs, house by house. One night the weather was very cold. I thought that the sows in the team were about to give birth to piglets, and if no one took care of them, the piglets would surely freeze to death. So I took a quilt to the pigsty to sleep and took care of the piglets. I did it according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

    Tian Huagui said: Bourgeois "authorities" say that workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works is "simplification" and "pragmatism." This is a slander against our workers, peasants, and soldiers. We workers, peasants, and soldiers of the Mao Zedong era are fully capable of studying Chairman Mao's works and studying well and applying them well. Although the time we have spent in our brigade studying and applying Chairman Mao's works flexibly is very short, the changes are quite big. In the past, the team leader had to shout with a megaphone to get people to work. In the past two years, the megaphone is no longer needed. Without broadcasting or whistling, people are already in the fields working when the time comes. In the past, people who plowed the fields would rush to save time, and when they encountered a stone, they would step on it and leave it at the bottom of the field. Now they move the stones up.

    Old poor peasant commune member Huang Kuixian said: I used to put collective affairs behind me and put my own affairs first. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," my thinking changed. Chairman Mao said that Bethune is utterly devoted to others without any thought of self. Looking at Bethune and comparing myself, I feel very wrong. I made up my mind to transform my thinking, concentrate my energy on doing a good job in collective production, support national construction, support the Vietnamese people, and oppose U.S. imperialism. I will always listen to Chairman Mao's words and read Chairman Mao's books. (He shouted excitedly): Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party!

    Party branch deputy secretary and militia battalion commander Li Qing said: After studying Chairman Mao's works, the old customs and habits of the entire brigade have changed. There are no more feudal clan conflicts, no more superstitions about feng shui, gods, and ghosts, and there are more and more good people and good deeds that help others, unite and help each other, and pick up lost money. In the past two years, more than 300 people have done good deeds and been praised. Young militiamen are competing to fetch water and chop firewood for military families and the elderly. When the militiamen and young people from Futian Team pass through other villages while holding meetings, they bring firewood to the military families in other villages along the way. There are many such things. The more those bourgeois "authorities" scold us, the more we must study Chairman Mao's works well, improve our ideological consciousness, and we must make a clean break with the ghost logic of "Man is for himself, heaven and earth will destroy him" spoken by the exploiting class.

    Being in Huangshandong, Seeing the Whole World

    Study tutor and poor peasant Li Xinhua said: Mao Zedong Thought is the magic weapon of the Chinese people's revolution, and it is also the magic weapon of the world's people's revolution. Studying, publicizing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought is the most glorious thing. When I think that two-thirds of the people in the world are still suffering, I will work harder to study Chairman Mao's works, publicize Mao Zedong Thought, and participate more actively in production. My education level is low, and there are many difficulties in studying well, applying well, and publicizing well, but we want to make revolution, we love Chairman Mao's works, and we are not afraid of any difficulties.

    Qiu Zhuying said: I have three sons, two older ones are working outside, and I wanted to keep the youngest one by my side. Last year, I studied a Chairman Mao quote: "Without a people's army, the people have nothing." One sentence enlightened my heart. In the past, we poor people had no guns, but the landlords and the Kuomintang had guns. They could beat us if they wanted to, kill us if they wanted to, and we couldn't protect a grain of rice or a piece of torn clothing. Once, my husband was dying of illness, and the Kuomintang bandit army even beat him with gun butts and burned all his torn clothes and broken quilts. In the cold winter months, I hugged my sons and warmed ourselves by the fire until dawn. Today, U.S. imperialism is killing and setting fires in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese people are suffering as we did before liberation. U.S. imperialism has come to our door and wants to put a knife back on our necks. Thinking of these things, I resolutely sent my youngest son to join the army. I often write to him to study Chairman Mao's works well, defend our country, and support the world's people's revolution.

    Zhang Laijiao said: Studying Chairman Mao's works made me understand that farming is for the revolution, and herding cattle is also for the revolution. I injured my waist two years ago, and herding a cow for the production team also felt hard. After understanding this principle, I asked to herd another cow. I take good care of the cattle, accumulate more fertilizer, and free up a strong labor force, which can do more heavy farm work, produce more grain, support national construction, support the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism, and support the world's people in making revolution.

    Li Qing said: Last year, the militiamen of our brigade repeatedly studied the article "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," which tells the story of the farmer and the viper, which has educated us the most. The more we study, the clearer our hearts become, and the brighter our eyes become. We will never pity evil people like vipers. We always think of imperialism abroad, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists at home, as well as ghosts and monsters like the "Three-Family Village" black gang and bourgeois "authorities," and the people who are suffering in the world. Thinking of these things, we have more energy to produce and higher enthusiasm for military training. The militiamen who were afraid of hardship when they were on guard at night in the past are no longer afraid; those who were not serious about military training have become serious. They practice shooting and throwing grenades whenever they have free time. Last year's shooting assessment showed that the average score reached excellence, and there were also six top marksmen. Now, as soon as we give an order, we can gather and go into battle in a few minutes. If U.S. imperialism dares to invade us, we will make sure that they come and never leave. The "Three-Family Village" black gang wants to be an internal应援 for imperialism, which is even more of a daydream. Whether it is an enemy with a gun or an enemy without a gun, we are not afraid. We must work hard to study Chairman Mao's works, hold the gun tightly, actively participate in the Great Cultural Revolution, and resolutely carry the revolution through to the end.

### 我们最爱毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话——黄山洞大队贫下中农举行座谈，痛斥资产阶级“权威”

    我们最爱毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话
    ——黄山洞大队贫下中农举行座谈，痛斥资产阶级“权威”
    最近，广东省学习毛主席著作先进单位、博罗县石坝公社黄山洞大队的贫下中农和干部进行了多次座谈。他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱，对反党反社会主义分子无比愤慨的心情，用本大队的事实和自己的切身体会，有力地反击了“三家村”黑帮对毛泽东思想的攻击，痛斥了所谓“权威”诬蔑工农兵学习毛主席著作是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”的谬论。
    不学毛主席著作，就不懂得革命
    贫农女社员张来娇说：邓拓那帮坏蛋和那些资产阶级“权威”，恶毒攻击毛泽东思想，反对我们听毛主席的话、读毛主席的书，真是狼心狗肺！毛主席的话，句句都说到我们贫下中农心里，我们最爱听毛主席的话。毛主席讲，没有贫农就没有革命，我体会到：贫下中农不学毛主席著作，就不懂得革命。解放前，我们贫农受苦受难。我祖父、阿爸三代讨饭。祖父被地主挖掉眼睛，当场喂了狗。我六岁就卖给地主做使妹（婢女），二十岁又卖到黄山洞。一天到晚，挑担烧炭，长年吃硬饭头（土茯苓）、猴哥蕨（野生植物），饿得黄皮瘦弱。我丈夫病死的时候，没有棺材，用一条烂席裹着就埋了。丈夫死后，我带着六个孩子，没依没靠，少吃缺穿，只好把孩子卖掉。旧社会，七重石板七重砖压在我们头上，翻不了身。感谢毛主席领导我们翻了身，分了田，分了屋，日子一日好过一日，现在的日子，好比白糖加蜜糖，甜上加甜。这叫我怎能不听毛主席的话呢！要听毛主席的话，就要读毛主席的书。想想过去，比比现在，毛主席的书，我越学越爱学。邓拓和那些“权威”攻击毛泽东思想，叫我们贫农莫听毛主席的话，莫读毛主席的书，我坚决同他们斗到底。
    老游击队员、林场民兵排长田进民说：过去我们自己没有枪，受尽反动派的压迫剥削，感谢毛主席领导我们，打下了江山，掌握了政权，有了自己的武装。我要努力学习毛主席著作，紧握手中的枪，保卫三面红旗，保卫毛泽东思想。
    贫农女社员邱祝英说：毛主席是我们的大救星，处处为我们贫农着想，毛主席的话句句真，句句甜。我岁数大，记性不好，又不识字，初学时，好多困难，辅导员教我学了《愚公移山》，听了毛主席的话，我就下定决心，排除万难，努力学习，牢牢记住毛主席的话。毛主席说过：拿枪的敌人被消灭了，还有不拿枪的敌人。如果不同他们斗，国民党就会回来，我们就要重新被这些坏家伙踏在脚底下，受剥削，受压迫。
    林场场长古石金说：毛主席著作是我们各项工作的最高指示，我们一时一刻都离不开毛泽东思想，一离开就会犯错误。搞土改、合作化、公社化时，我们都听毛主席的话，坚决依靠贫农。但是，一九六三年，我们有些干部，忘记了毛主席的话，忘记了阶级路线，对贫下中农的阶级感情淡薄了，在生产上，不依靠他们，而依靠上中农，因此生产搞不好。后来，我们学习了毛主席著作，知道了毛主席说的“没有贫农，便没有革命”这句话的重要性。我们紧紧依靠贫下中农，生产就搞好了。一九六四年和一九六五年，产量都有了很大的增加。这使我们认识到，只有永远听毛主席的话，不忘记贫下中农，不忘记阶级斗争，才能保证时时、处处不犯错误。
    党支部书记田华贵说：我们贫农，要彻底翻身，就要听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书。毛泽东思想，是我们进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指路明灯。一九六二年以前，我们大队遭受了自然灾害。这时，地主富农乘机破坏，说什么：“黄山洞山高水冷，地瘦人穷，没办法改变”，社员思想很不安。后来，我们干部、社员学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争的理论和《为人民服务》等文章。毛主席的教导，提高了我们的信心和勇气，大家决心把黄山洞改变成为“黄金洞”。我们根据毛主席的指示，抓了阶级斗争，揭露和批判了地主富农的破坏行为，又帮助一些干部纠正了资本主义思想，进行了忆苦思甜。终于克服了困难，取得了很大的成绩。我们贫下中农，要革命，就要学习毛主席著作，就要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    思想变、风俗人情都在变
    生产队长李石金说：我们队有个中农马观妹，是六个孩子的母亲，她懂得过去穷人妇女身上捆着千条绳万条索，是毛主席解放了她们。她就一直坚持学习毛主席著作。她常说：“学毛主席著作，就是为了改造自己。学了不改造思想，还是白学！”她学习了“毫不利己专门利人”的观点，就检查、改正了过去出勤拈轻怕重，好肥料不交给生产队的缺点。在山上开穴种桐树，是最重的工作，她就抢着去做，有时带病也出勤。老社员李汉清家没人挑水，她就帮他挑。她过去经常和别人吵架，闹不团结。学了毛主席著作，认识到对待自己的阶级姊妹要极端热忱，就改正了这个缺点。学了毛主席著作，她完全变了样。那些资产阶级“权威”，胡说我们学习毛主席著作是“简单化”。这些老爷们，故意把革命理论说得那么玄虚吓唬我们，不让我们去学习，这样他们的反动货色就可以拿出来贩卖了。这是梦想！
    邱祝英说：我们贫下中农学习毛主席著作，不象你们“权威”那样为了装门面、干坏事；而是为了按毛主席的话办事、做人。过去碰到占不到什么便宜的事情，我就不愿意去做。生产队在我门前晒谷，下雨了我也不去收，认为得不到工分。外面同志来找干部，我是不理睬的，认为冷水要肩挑，开水要柴烧，来者千千，去者万万，管不了那么多。学了《纪念白求恩》，我的思想变了，觉得人生在世光为食着（吃穿）没意思。毛主席讲，要做一个有益于人民的人。我就照毛主席的话去做。平常见了什么就做什么，看到下雨，再远也会赶回来帮助收谷；外面同志来找干部，我就帮他们找，还烧开水给他们喝。我想，人家是为了革命，我帮助人家，也是为了革命。
    贫农社员田金说：我们贫农，过去受地主阶级统治，吃了多少苦头。学了毛主席著作，懂得了要象白求恩、张思德那样做人才有意义。我过去当保管员，仓库漏了水，谷种生了芽，受到队长批评，就想不干；学了《纪念白求恩》，才感到不对。要学白求恩同志那样“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”。割禾后分口粮，社员们劳动忙，没空来挑，我就把谷子挑到社员家里去，一家一家帮着他们吊到楼上去。有一晚天气很冷，我想到队里母猪要生小猪，如果没有人料理，小猪一定会冻死。我就抱了棉被到猪栏去睡，料理好小猪。我就是按照毛主席的指示去做的。
    田华贵说：资产阶级“权威”，说什么工农兵学习毛主席著作是“简单化”、“实用主义”，这是对我们工农兵的污蔑。我们毛泽东时代的工农兵，完全能够学习毛主席著作，而且学得好，用得好。我们大队活学活用毛主席著作的时间虽然很短，变化可不小。过去出勤，队长要用广播筒喊，这两年，广播筒用不着了。不广播，不吹哨，到时候人都在田里劳动了。过去耙田的人赶时间，碰到石头，把石头踩到田底去就算了，现在都把石头搬上来。
    老贫农社员黄奎先说：我过去把集体的事放在后面，自己的事摆在前头。学了《纪念白求恩》，我的思想就变了。毛主席讲，白求恩毫不利己、专门利人。看看白求恩，比比自己，觉得很不对。我下了决心，改造思想，集中精力搞好集体生产，支援国家建设，支援越南人民，反对美帝国主义。我要永远听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书。（他激动地高呼）：毛主席万万岁！共产党万万年！
    党支部副书记、民兵营长李清说：学习毛主席著作以后，全大队旧的风俗人情都有了改变。闹封建宗族矛盾的没有了，迷信风水、神鬼的也没有了，助人为乐、团结互助、拾金不昧的好人好事，一天比一天多了。这两年，做了好事、受到表扬的就有三百多人。青年民兵，争着替军属、老人挑水砍柴。福田队的民兵、青年开会时路过别村，顺路就给别村的军属带柴火。这类事情多得很。那些资产阶级“权威”越是骂我们，我们越是要好好学习毛主席著作，提高思想觉悟，一定要和剥削阶级说的“人不为己、天诛地灭”的鬼道理一刀两断。
    身在黄山洞，眼看全世界
    学习辅导员、贫农李新华说：毛泽东思想是中国人民革命的法宝，也是全世界人民革命的法宝。学习、宣传毛泽东思想，是最光荣的事情。一想到世界上还有三分之二的人民还在受苦受难，我就更努力学习毛主席著作，宣传毛泽东思想，更积极参加生产。我的文化低，要学好用好宣传好，有很多困难，但是我们要革命，我们热爱毛主席著作，什么困难也不怕。
    邱祝英说：我有三个儿子，两个大的都在外面工作，最小的儿子，我一心想把他留在身边。去年，我学习了一条毛主席语录：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”一句话就点通了我的心。过去我们穷人没有枪，地主、国民党有枪，他们要打就打，要杀就杀，一粒谷、一件烂衫也保不住。有一次我的丈夫病得要死了，国民党匪军还拿枪托乱打他，破衫烂被也给烧光了。寒冬腊月，晚上抱着几个儿子烤火到天亮。今天，美帝国主义在南越杀人放火，南越人民正和我们解放前一样受苦受难，美帝国主义打到我们的门口来了，想重新把刀架在我们脖子上。想到这些，我就坚决送我的小儿子去参军。我常写信给他，要他学好毛主席著作，保卫我们的江山，支援世界人民革命。
    张来娇说：学了毛主席著作，使我懂得耕田是为了革命，看牛也是为了革命。我前年跌伤了腰骨，替生产队看一条牛也觉得辛苦。懂得了这个道理后，我就要求多看一条牛。我把牛看好，多积肥料，又腾出了一个强劳动力，可以多做粗重的农活，多打粮食，支援国家建设，支援越南人民反对美帝国主义，支援世界人民闹革命。
    李清说：我们大队的民兵，前年反复学习了《将革命进行到底》那篇文章，里面讲到农夫和毒蛇的故事，使我们受教育最深，越学心里越明，眼睛越亮。我们决不怜惜毒蛇一样的恶人。我们时刻都想到国外有帝国主义，国内还有地富反坏右，还有象“三家村”黑帮、象资产阶级“权威”那样的牛鬼蛇神，想到世界上还有受苦受难的人民。想到这些我们生产的劲头就更大，练兵的积极性就更高。民兵们过去晚上放哨怕辛苦的不怕了；练兵不认真的认真了。他们一有空闲就练射击、练投弹。去年射击考核，平均成绩达到优秀，还出现了六个特等射手。现在，我们只要一声号令，几分钟内就能集合起来投入战斗。美帝国主义胆敢侵犯我们，管叫他们有来无去。“三家村”黑帮想作帝国主义的内应，更是白日作梦。不管是拿枪的敌人，不拿枪的敌人，通通不在话下。我们要努力学习毛主席著作，紧握枪杆，积极参加文化大革命，坚决把革命进行到底。
