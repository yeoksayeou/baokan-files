    Good Reorganization, Correct Reorganization
    We are filled with excitement and warmly cheer the CCP Central Committee's decision to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. As everyone knows, under the control of bourgeois representatives, the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee had become a bourgeois stronghold for opposing the Party and socialism.
    Under these circumstances, our Party Central Committee's decision to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee is completely correct and wise. This decision fundamentally deprived the bourgeois representatives of their hegemony in the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. This decision represents the wishes of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We shout: Good reorganization! Correct reorganization! The wise decision of the Party Central Committee to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee once again proves that the dictatorship of the proletariat is absolutely inviolable. Whoever dares to touch a hair of the dictatorship of the proletariat, we will block his path, exercise our dictatorship over him, seize his power, and resolutely, thoroughly, and completely crush them. Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!

    改组得好　改组得对
    我们怀着万分激动的心情，热烈欢呼中共中央改组北京市委的决定。大家知道，前北京市委在资产阶级代表人物的把持下，已经成为资产阶级分子反党反社会主义的阵地。
    在这种情况下，我们党中央作出改组北京市委的决定完全是正确的、英明的。这个决定从根本上剥夺了资产阶级代表人物在北京市委的霸权，巩固了无产阶级专政。这个决定代表了亿万工农兵群众的心愿。我们高呼：改组得好！改组得对！党中央改组北京市委的英明决定，再一次证明了无产阶级专政是绝对不许侵犯的，谁要胆敢动无产阶级专政的一根毫毛，我们就要霸他的道，专他的政，夺他的权，把他们坚决、彻底、全部粉碎。中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
