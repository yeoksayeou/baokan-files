    To Be a Vanguard in the Great Cultural Revolution
    We, the coal mine workers, warmly support the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's decision to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. This wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao fully expresses the greatest aspirations of our working class. This is a major victory for the socialist Cultural Revolution and a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought.
    The countless facts of the current Great Cultural Revolution prove that the bourgeoisie is always attempting to undermine the dictatorship of the proletariat and seize our political power through class struggle in the ideological field. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, fiercely strike at these class enemies, and sweep away all monsters and demons.
    We coal mine workers are poor people who were rescued from the abyss of suffering by the Party and Chairman Mao. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie, countless class brothers died unjustly in the mines. Now, the revisionists want to revive their dead souls and once again lord it over us; we resolutely refuse to allow it. We are the vanguards of socialist construction, and we must also be the vanguards of the socialist Cultural Revolution. We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be thorough revolutionaries, and carry the Great Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    要做文化大革命的尖兵
    我们煤矿职工热烈拥护中共中央关于改组北京市委的决定。党中央和毛主席的这一英明的决定，充分表达了我们工人阶级的最大意愿。这是社会主义文化大革命的重大胜利，是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    当前文化大革命的无数事实证明，资产阶级始终妄图通过意识形态领域里的阶级斗争来瓦解无产阶级专政，夺取我们的政权。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，狠狠打击这些阶级敌人，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
    我们煤矿职工是党和毛主席从万丈苦井里救出来的穷苦人。过去，在资产阶级的反动统治下，不知有多少阶级兄弟冤死在井下。现在，修正主义者又想借尸还魂，重新作威作福，我们坚决不答应。我们是社会主义建设的尖兵，也一定要当社会主义文化大革命的尖兵。我们要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，当彻底的革命派，把文化大革命进行到底！
