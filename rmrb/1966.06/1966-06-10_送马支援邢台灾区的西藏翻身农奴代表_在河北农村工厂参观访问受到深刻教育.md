    Xinhua News Agency, Xingtai, 9th dispatch: Representatives of the million emancipated serfs from Tibet, who traveled from afar to send horses to support the earthquake-stricken area of Xingtai in Hebei Province, have visited rural areas and factories in Hebei Province and received a profound socialist education. During their visits, the Tibetan emancipated serfs witnessed the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes and the tremendous achievements of the motherland's industrial construction. They expressed their even greater love for the great leader of all ethnic groups in the country, Chairman Mao, and their love for the increasingly powerful socialist motherland. At the same time, wherever they went, they were warmly welcomed and cordially received by local cadres, commune members, or factory workers, which made them deeply feel the warmth of the motherland's big family.
    On May 19th, the Tibetan emancipated serfs visited the Xipu Brigade of the Jianming Commune in Zunhua County, which insisted on running a "poor stick society" with "three donkey legs." In the village history museum of Xipu Brigade, Wang Guofan, the head of Jianming Commune and the Party Branch Secretary of Xipu Brigade, introduced the earth-shaking changes that have taken place in Xipu Brigade from the initial 23 poor peasant households to the present, using the pictures and objects on display in the museum. The Tibetan compatriots listened attentively, and some carefully recorded these exciting changes in their notebooks.
    Then, the Tibetan compatriots came to the Shashi峪 Brigade of the Yuegezhuang Commune in Zunhua County for a visit. Zhang Guishun, the Party Branch Secretary of the brigade, accompanied the Tibetan brothers to Beishan to visit the terraced fields built with loads of soil. Zhang Guishun pointed to a large well and introduced that this well originally had no water, but now the well behind the mountain is completed, and this is water pumped from behind the mountain, so there is no need to worry about water here anymore. After hearing this, the Tibetan brothers cheered "Long live the people's commune" again and again.
    On May 31st, the Tibetan compatriots visited the Nan Gunlonggou Brigade of the Zhaibei Commune in Pingshan County. They walked into the entrance of Nan Gunlonggou Village, and nodded happily as they looked at the golden wheat waves. In particular, after the Tibetan brothers saw the high-standard terraced fields and the single-hole large stone bridge built by the people of Nan Gunlonggou, they were all moved by the revolutionary spirit of the people of Nan Gunlonggou in starting their businesses arduously. Some Tibetan brothers said that this is the magnificent stone bridge created by the members of the Nan Gunlonggou with their own hands, which is the victory of the three red banners, the great wisdom of the working people, and the incomparable power of Mao Zedong Thought. The Tibetan compatriots expressed: We must use the spirit of Nan Gunlonggou to build the Dazhai of Tibet and spread the revolutionary seeds of Nan Gunlonggou throughout Tibet.
    In addition to visiting the rural people's communes, the Tibetan compatriots also visited factories in Tianjin, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang and other places, such as metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, and textiles. In the factories, they personally saw the new look of the motherland's industrial construction, and the revolutionary spirit of the working class working selflessly for socialism, and were all profoundly educated. The Tibetan worker Gongka said that in the factory, we not only saw the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of the working class, but also saw the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.
    On June 7th, the Tibetan compatriots visited the Qianhuying Brigade of the Qianhuying Commune in the earthquake-stricken area. In order to help the class brothers in the disaster area to rebuild their homes as soon as possible, they participated in the labor of building houses and threshing fields, and worked with the local Han commune members to deliver materials, build walls, and mix mud.
    At noon on this day, the Tibetan brothers went to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasant commune members in Qianhuying to have lunch. Qi Wanying, an 80-year-old poor peasant commune member, specially steamed a pot of steamed buns for the Tibetan brothers to entertain the class brothers from thousands of miles away. Qi Wanying's old partner Wang Xiangyue said to everyone, the poor all over the world are one family, let's have a reunion dinner today. Chilie, a Tibetan compatriot who had been a serf for 24 years, continued, we were very sad to hear that you were hit by a disaster. We don’t have anything good to give you, so we sent a few horses to express the feelings of our million emancipated serfs to our class brothers. In the home of poor peasant commune member Qi Shuxin, under the image of Chairman Mao, sat Qi Shuxin's family and Tibetan brothers. The Tibetan woman Sandan Wangma and Qi Shuxin's old partner snuggled together tightly, and Sandan Wangma kept asking about the injuries of Aunt Qi. After Aunt Qi told how she was cured in the hospital, everyone turned their faces to the image of Chairman Mao. Dunzhu looked at the image of Chairman Mao and said excitedly, Chairman Mao brought happiness to our poor people. After I go back, I must read Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and build a new Tibet.
    During the days of the Tibetan compatriots' visit to Hebei Province, they deeply felt the glory and greatness of the motherland, and expressed that they would join hands with the Han people under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. A song composed by Suolang and sung by Ale fully expresses the feelings of the Tibetan brothers. The song sings: "The ethnic policy formulated by Chairman Mao radiates brilliant golden light, thank the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, thank the people of Hebei Province, here we have seen the huge factory built by the class brothers with both hands, and the infinitely superior people's commune, we feel the infinite greatness of the motherland, and the pride of being a Chinese people who have stood up, let us join hands and advance forever under the red banner of the great Mao Zedong Thought!"

    送马支援邢台灾区的西藏翻身农奴代表
    在河北农村工厂参观访问受到深刻教育
    据新华社邢台九日电　不远万里为河北省邢台地震灾区送马的西藏百万翻身农奴的代表，先后在河北省农村、工厂进行了参观访问，受到一次深刻的社会主义教育。在参观访问中，藏族翻身农奴亲眼看到了人民公社的无比优越性，看到了祖国工业建设的巨大成就，他们表示更加热爱全国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席，热爱日益强大的社会主义祖国。同时，他们每到一地，都受到当地干部、社员或工厂职工的热烈欢迎和亲切接待，使他们深深体会到祖国大家庭的温暖。
    五月十九日，藏族翻身农奴参观了遵化县坚持“三条驴腿”办“穷棒子社”的建明公社西铺大队。在西铺大队的村史馆里，建明公社社长、西铺大队党支部书记王国藩，就馆内展出的图片和实物，向藏族兄弟介绍了他们从二十三户贫农办社起，一直到现在西铺大队发生的翻天覆地变化。藏族同胞都认真地听着，有的用心地在笔记本上记下这些激动人心的变化。
    接着，藏族同胞又来到遵化县岳各庄公社沙石峪大队参观访问。大队党支部书记张贵顺陪着藏族兄弟到北山，参观这里用一担担土垫起来的梯田。张贵顺指着一眼大口井向人们介绍说，这眼井原本没有水，现在山后的井竣工了，这是抽水机从山后抽过来的水，从此这里再也不愁没水了。藏族兄弟听了后，一再欢呼“人民公社万岁”。
    五月三十一日，藏族同胞又参观了平山县宅北公社的南滚龙沟大队。他们走进南滚龙沟村口，望着金色的麦浪，高兴得连连点头。特别是藏族兄弟看了南滚龙沟人修建的高标准梯田和独孔大石桥后，都为南滚龙沟人艰苦创业的革命精神所感动。有的藏胞兄弟说，这是南滚龙沟社员用自己的双手创造的顶天立地的大石桥，是三面红旗的胜利，是劳动人民的伟大智慧，是毛泽东思想的无比威力。藏胞们表示：一定要以南滚龙沟的精神，建设西藏的大寨，把南滚龙沟的革命种子，撒遍全西藏。
    藏族同胞除参观了农村人民公社外，还在天津、唐山、石家庄等地参观了冶金、机械制造、纺织等工厂。在工厂里，他们亲眼看到了祖国工业建设的新貌，看到了工人阶级为社会主义忘我劳动的革命精神，无不受到深刻的教育。藏族工人公卡说，在工厂里，我们不仅看到了工人阶级冲天的革命干劲，同时看到了毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    六月七日，藏族同胞访问了地震灾区的千户营公社千户营大队。为了帮助灾区阶级兄弟尽快恢复家园，他们便参加了建屋和打场的劳动，和当地汉族社员一道送料，砌墙、和泥。
    这天中午，藏族兄弟到千户营贫农下中农社员家里吃午饭。八十岁的贫农社员齐万营特地为藏族兄弟蒸了一锅馒头，招待万里之外的阶级兄弟。齐万营的老伴王香月对大家说，天下穷人是一家，今天咱们吃一顿团圆饭吧。当了二十四年农奴的藏胞赤列接着说，我们听说你们受了灾，心里很难过，我们没有什么好东西送给你们，送来几匹马，表表我们百万翻身农奴对阶级兄弟的心意。在贫农社员齐树信的家里，在毛主席的象下，坐着齐树信一家人和藏族兄弟，藏族妇女三丹王玛和齐树信的老伴紧紧地依偎在一起，三丹王玛不时地询问齐大娘被砸伤的情况。当齐大娘讲了她怎样在医院把伤治好后，大家一齐把脸转向毛主席象，顿珠望着毛主席象激动地说，毛主席给咱穷人带来了幸福。我回去后，一定要很好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，建设新西藏。
    藏族同胞在河北省参观访问的日子里，深深感到祖国的光荣伟大，表示要在毛泽东思想红旗下和汉族人民携手并进。由索朗编词，阿勒演唱的一首歌充分表达了藏胞兄弟的心情，歌中唱到：“毛主席制定的民族政策放出了光辉灿烂的金光，感谢河北省委、感谢河北省的人民，在这里我们见到了阶级兄弟双手建立的巨大工厂，见到了无比优越的人民公社，我们感到祖国无限伟大，感到作为一个站起来的中国人民的自豪，让我们携起手来在伟大的毛泽东思想红旗下前进，永远前进！”
