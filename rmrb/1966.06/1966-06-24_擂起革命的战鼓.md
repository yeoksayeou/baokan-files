    "The CCP Central Committee and the State Council have decided to reform the college entrance examination system..." Before the words from the loudspeaker were finished, applause and cheers erupted, merging into a single sound.
    Classrooms boiled!
    The whole school boiled!
    Tears welled in our eyes as we rushed to tell each other! Shouting, jumping! Announcing it once! Twice! A thousand, ten thousand times! But how could we fully express the excitement in our hearts! How could we express our deep love for Chairman Mao and the Party!
    Dear Party, dear Chairman Mao! It is precisely in the storm of this Great Cultural Revolution, precisely in today's vigorous east wind, that you have spoken the words in our hearts and made this great and wise decision. The old college entrance examination system was a cultural yoke around the necks of the working people. Today, we will smash it completely! A new road leading to communism will be paved by our hands! This revolutionary burden is about to be shouldered by us. How can we not be excited, and how can we not love the Party and Chairman Mao even more!
    To report the good news to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is our common wish. Everyone is preparing intensely.
    In the classroom of Senior Third (1) class, students are writing slogans in groups of three and five, small colorful flags bearing the words from their hearts. "Make revolution together with workers, peasants, and soldiers!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party!" These are not just simple words, but fiery hearts of thousands of young people loyal to the Party and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought!
    Senior Third (2) class presents another scene: they are earnestly posting portraits of Chairman Mao. Students cannot help but hum "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Advance" and "Unleash a High Tide of the Great Cultural Revolution." The powerful singing echoes throughout the classroom.
    The sound of drums comes again from the campus. These are the Young Pioneer drummers practicing. They brave the scorching sun, sweat profusely, and practice again and again. They want to express their love for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao with loud, unified drumming.
    All the students in the school are actively preparing to report the good news to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Each class has selected the students with the best handwriting to copy letters to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Letters filled with revolutionary fervor have been written. The Young Pioneers of Junior First (2) class wrote in their letter: "...Future schools will be true revolutionary furnaces. Thousands upon thousands of children of workers, peasants, and soldiers will be able to enter this red furnace. We will become true Marxist-Leninists, and we will become true successors to the revolution." These are the heroic words of revolutionary successors, the revolutionary third and fourth generations beating the drums of war. It will reach Tiananmen, spread throughout China, and spread throughout the world! It shatters the revisionist dream of restoring capitalism and expresses the determination of revolutionary youth to be successors to the proletarian revolution!
    Dear Party, dear Chairman Mao, you must have heard our voices, you must have seen our young and vigorous force. We must take over the great Mao

    擂起革命的战鼓
    北京市第二女子中学  全体革命同学
    “中共中央和国务院决定改革高等学校招考办法……”扩音器里的话还没说完，掌声、欢呼声就冲天而起，响成一片。
    各教室沸腾了！
    全校沸腾了！
    我们热泪盈眶，奔走相告！说呀，跳呀！一遍！二遍！千遍万遍地传告着！可是，又怎能说得完我们内心的激动！又怎能表达出我们热爱毛主席，热爱党的深情！
    亲爱的党，亲爱的毛主席！正是在这文化大革命的风暴中，正是在这东风劲吹的今天，是您，说出了我们的心里话，做出了伟大英明的决定。旧的高考制度是套在劳动人民脖子上的文化桎梏，今天，我们要把它彻底砸烂！一条通向共产主义的新路要在我们手中铺就！这一革命重担即将由我们挑起，我们怎能不激动，又怎能不更热爱党，热爱毛主席！
    向党中央、毛主席去报喜，这是我们共同的心愿。人人都在紧张地准备着。
    高三（一）班教室里，同学们三个一伙、五个一堆地在写标语，一面面的小彩旗，写上了一句句的心里话。“和工农兵一起干革命！”“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”这不是几个简单的字句，而是寄托着我们千万个青年忠于党、忠于毛泽东思想的一颗颗火热的心！
    高三（二）班又一番气象：她们在认真地张贴毛主席象。同学们情不自禁地哼着《工农兵向前进》、《掀起文化大革命高潮》，有力的歌声，响彻了整个教室。
    校园里又传来阵阵鼓声，这是少先队的鼓手们在练习。他们冒烈日，挥热汗，练了一遍又一遍，他们要以响亮整齐的鼓声来表达对党中央、毛主席的热爱。
    全校同学都在为向党中央、毛主席报喜而积极准备着，各个班都推出写字最好的同学，抄写给党中央、毛主席的信。一封封洋溢着革命豪情的信写就了，初一（二）班少先队员在信中写道：“……以后的学校，将是真正的革命熔炉，千千万万的工农兵子弟都能投入这个红色的熔炉，我们将成为真正的马克思列宁主义者，将成为真正的革命接班人。”这是革命接班人的豪言壮语，是革命的第三代、第四代擂起的战鼓。它传到天安门，传遍全中国，传遍全世界！它敲碎了修正主义阴谋复辟的美梦，表达了革命青年誓做无产阶级革命接班人的决心！
    亲爱的党，亲爱的毛主席，您一定听到了我们的声音，您一定看到了我们这支年青的生力军。我们一定要把伟大的毛泽东思想接过来，传下去！我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底！
