    *People's Liberation Army Daily* Editor's Note: Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most selfless, the most courageous, the most steadfast, and possess the greatest combat effectiveness.
    In our era, the growth of all heroic model figures is invariably the result of the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and invariably the result of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect. This is true of Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande, and it is also true of Zhang Chunyu.
    Comrade Zhang Chunyu, like thousands upon thousands of workers, peasants, and soldiers, loves the Party, loves Chairman Mao, and regards Mao Zedong Thought as the red sun in his heart. Those bourgeois "authorities," attempting to realize the shameful conspiracy of capitalist restoration, extremely hate Mao Zedong Thought, using "vulgarization" on one hand and "simplification" on the other, doing everything possible to obstruct and viciously oppose the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works by the worker-peasant-soldier masses. They are wasting their efforts. The actions of Zhang Chunyu and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works have given them the most powerful counterattack.
    Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become an infinitely powerful spiritual atomic bomb. Zhang Chunyu, this ordinary young soldier, underwent a tremendous change in his spiritual world after studying Chairman Mao's works. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, he transformed his worldview and resolved to serve the Chinese people and the world's people completely and thoroughly for life. He vowed: In this life, I am willing to be a handful of earth, a piece of stone, a sleeper, laid on the road to communism, allowing the revolutionary train to pass over me, advancing at full speed. Wherever Chairman Mao speaks, he resolutely acts. He is happy to endure the greatest hardships for the people, constantly transforming himself in labor. Precisely because of this, he was able to complete his tasks excellently in normal times and, in times of crisis, bravely rescue his comrades, performing heroic actions worthy of a good soldier of Chairman Mao.
    Comrade Zhang Chunyu said, do not forget class struggle, stand at the forefront of class struggle, and dare to compete with the enemy in various forms of class struggle. This is his profound understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions on class and class struggle, and it is also his clear stance in class struggle. Currently, the socialist cultural revolution being carried out in our country is a life-and-death class struggle. We should have the clear attitude of Comrade Zhang Chunyu, actively participate in this struggle, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, thoroughly smash those anti-Party and anti-socialist gangs, and at the same time transform our subjective world.
    Comrade Zhang Chunyu has written many心得体会 (understandings and experiences) from studying Chairman Mao's works and diaries in his years of hard work. Here is an excerpt of some of them. To facilitate everyone's reading, we have made some deletions, classified them, and added subheadings.

    With a Red Sun in the Heart, No Obstacles on the Road Ahead

    July 1, 1963
    Today is the birthday of the great Communist Party of China. Back in 1921, our Party was founded today, leading the people of the whole country, overthrowing the enemy, seizing victory, and establishing today's happy life.
    Living in such happiness, I am extremely grateful to the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao. I am now a glorious People's soldier and must make achievements in defending the motherland, striving to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. I must resolutely:
    1. Maintain a firm class stand, clear love and hatred, never forget our roots, and be loyal to the Party and Chairman Mao, and loyal to the cause of human liberation.
    2. Always put the interests of the Party first, always proceed from the needs of the revolution, and be determined to be a "never-rusting screw," establishing the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people.
    3. Establish the noble communist virtues of hard work and plain living, diligence and thrift, utter devotion to others without any thought of self.
    4. Strive to study Chairman Mao's works, consciously accept the Party's education, strictly demand of myself, conscientiously transform myself, and establish the idea of being eager to learn and make progress.

     December 7, 1963
    Crops need sunshine to grow, and revolutionary soldiers without the arming of Mao Zedong Thought will lose their way. (Learning experience of the Good Eighth Company)
    This is a truth. As long as we work hard to do this, then we will advance courageously. As long as we arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, then we will do everything well for the Party and the people. I must remember this truth.

    April 3, 1964
    When we study Chairman Mao's works, we must study them regularly and repeatedly, like the ceaseless river water, flowing from spring to summer, from autumn to winter, never stopping for a moment.

    July ×, 1964
    I enlisted in the army last March. But at that time, the purpose of serving was not clear enough. Why be a soldier? What kind of soldier should I be? I was not clear in my heart. Later, I studied Lei Feng's deeds, which greatly encouraged me. I thought: Why can Lei Feng do so well? I have also encountered some things in normal times! Why can't I do it? I thought deeply again and again, and the reason was found. The most fundamental thing is that (Lei Feng) listens to the Party and Chairman Mao and armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought. From then on, I loved Chairman Mao's works even more.
    Only by studying Chairman Mao's works well can we stand firm in the face of great storms, can we distinguish right from wrong, not lose our direction, stand firm on the proletarian position, can we grasp our weapons tightly, can we defend our regime, can we carry the revolution through to the end.

    January 9, 1965
    Chairman Mao's works are the indispensable spiritual food for every soldier. Only by conscientiously studying Chairman Mao's works and arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought can we talk about being "red." I think that in work, the tighter the time, the busier the work, the heavier the burden, the more important it is to put "red" first and let ideology lead. Only with a red ideology can we overcome difficulties and achieve victory.

     January 15, 1965
    Chairman Mao taught us: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are stamped with the brand of class."
    What kind of person says what kind of words, and what kind of thoughts will lead to what kind of things. We must constantly carry out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought.

     February 10, 1966
     You ask why I'm optimistic and cheerful?
     It's just because I have a red sun in my heart.
     Shining brightly before, behind, left, and right,
     No obstacles on the road ahead.

    Never Forget Class Struggle, Stand at the Forefront of Class Struggle

     March 29, 1963
    When I was reading every real and painful story in the book *Blood and Tears*, tears couldn't help but fall on the book. I am a proletarian revolutionary soldier, how can I not be saddened by the suffering of my class brothers? How can I not hate the three major enemies who oppress my class brothers? I shouted: "Avenge the martyred heroes!" "Liberate the suffering compatriots in Taiwan!"

    May 12, 1963
    Dealing with the invisible enemies in the realm of political thought requires a higher degree of revolutionary vigilance than dealing with tangible enemies. The ideological erosion and influence of the bourgeoisie is subtle. If we do not highly raise our vigilance and consciously resist it, we will unconsciously be infected with bourgeois ideology, erode our revolutionary will, and even become corrupt, degenerate, and qualitatively change.
                                            (*Reading Newspaper* Excerpt)

    January 22, 1964
    I am a child who grew up in a poor family. The reason why I can grow up so much, go to school for so many years (eleven years), and get such happiness is given by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. I must firmly remember it in my heart, listen to Chairman Mao, firmly believe in the leadership of the Party, stand firm on the proletarian position, resolutely take the proletarian road, remember the painful life of the past, remember class hatred, class hatred, and not forget our roots. We must firmly remember class struggle, enhance the concept of class struggle, and fight against all monsters and demons.

    September 22, 1964
    Chairman Mao said: "It is a good thing, not a bad thing, to be opposed by the enemy." This is a scientific conclusion drawn by Chairman Mao using the method of class analysis, and it is also a truth that has been proven thousands of times in revolutionary struggle. When we study Chairman Mao's article, we must learn the firm proletarian stand and the fearless revolutionary spirit and revolutionary courage reflected in the article, so that we can see clearly, stand firm, and withstand the current domestic and international class struggles.
    The world today is full of class struggle. Imperialism opposes us, the domestic class enemies who have been overthrown oppose us, and modern revisionists are increasingly openly colluding with imperialists and reactionary nationalists, desperately opposing us. Faced with this situation, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and clearly recognize that being opposed by them is a good thing, not a bad thing. The more vigorously they oppose us, the more they criticize us as being worthless, the more precisely it proves that our socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved great success.
    We must neither forget class struggle nor fear class struggle, and we must dare to compete with the enemy in various forms of class struggle.

    November 9, 1964
    "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until their extinction—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the cause of the people, and they will never violate this logic. This is a Marxist law." The other is: "Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory—this is the logic of the people, and they will never violate this logic either."
    With these two Marxist-Leninist laws, we have a more thorough understanding of imperialism and all reactionaries. Whether it appears as a ferocious tiger or in the guise of a sheep, their nature is always the same.
    With these two laws, our understanding of the power of the people's revolution is clearer, and we will be full of confidence in the strength of the people and the future of the struggle. In the end, we will overthrow the ruling class and defeat imperialism.

     April 1 to 3, 1965
    (US) Imperialism suffered a defeat in the Korean War, and now it is launching a new war in Vietnam. Its launching of a war does not mean that it is strong, but precisely shows its weakness, is making a dying struggle, and is ultimately doomed to failure. It will not shed tears until it sees the coffin. The aggressive nature of imperialism cannot be changed. (It) is now launching a war of aggression in Vietnam, and we as revolutionary soldiers cannot ignore it. We have a responsibility to help them (Vietnam) fight for liberation, eliminate imperialism, and defend world peace. I am now fully prepared. As long as the motherland and the Vietnamese people need it, I will pick up my gun and step forward to eliminate US imperialism and defend Vietnam and world peace.

     January 5, 1966
    Our young people do not have a deep understanding of class oppression, which requires us to study hard Chairman Mao's theory on class struggle. Socialist education is the best classroom for our young people to learn about class struggle. We must immerse ourselves in this hot struggle and temper ourselves to be stronger.

    May 11, 1966
    The movie *The Besieged City* is a bad film that glorifies the enemy. Would Minister Jiang befriend the enemy and the enemy would revolt? This is impossible. The whole stage is full of enemies, and we cannot see our people. Without our heavy troops besieging the city, would the enemy revolt? That is absolutely impossible. The enemy robs the people, and the officials still call for it to be sent back. Is there such a thing? Treating the enemy as good people means not distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy. The film does not distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, saying that the enemy is very good, but not mentioning us at all. Chairman Mao taught us that the enemy cannot lay down the butcher knife, let alone become a Buddha on the spot. The film opposes Mao Zedong Thought, saying that the enemy can lay down the butcher knife and can become a Buddha on the spot. We resolutely pull out this poisonous weed and will never be fooled by them!

    May 22, 1966
    I was lying in a hospital bed recovering from injuries. From the newspapers and radio, I learned about the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the Deng Tuo gang. Especially when I heard them most frantically and viciously attacking our great Party and instigating our young people not to read Chairman Mao's books or listen to Chairman Mao's words, I was so angry that I couldn't lie still or sleep peacefully, and I had to pick up my pen to fight them.
    Deng Tuo, a traitor wearing the signboard of a Communist Party member, dared to openly oppose our young people reading Chairman Mao's books, arrogantly attempting to take off our "microscopes" and let us wear bourgeois black glasses, unable to distinguish between right and wrong, unable to distinguish between enemies and friends, to prepare spiritual conditions for capitalist restoration. We are the youth of the Mao Zedong era and will never be fooled by you guys.
    We revolutionary youth have always had infinite trust in the great Mao Zedong Thought. We have deeply realized from revolutionary practice that listening to Chairman Mao's words and believing in Mao Zedong Thought is trusting the revolution and believing in the truth. No matter when, we firmly believe, unswervingly, and resolutely act in accordance with the highest instructions. We do not rely on heaven or earth, but on Mao Zedong Thought. How Chairman Mao said it, we will do it. We revolutionary youth can give up our lives, shed our blood, but we must listen to Chairman Mao's words. If Chairman Mao says a little, I will do a little, and wherever Chairman Mao speaks, I will resolutely act.
    I was born into a poor peasant family and lived a life worse than cattle and horses in the old society. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who rescued me from the sea of ​​misery. After I joined the army, I became a glorious Communist Party member under the nurturing of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought. After being injured, the Party arranged the best medical conditions for me, and my injury quickly improved. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who gave me a second life. I love the Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart. The Deng Tuo gang attacked our great Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao, viciously attacking Mao Zedong Thought. This is a life-and-death class struggle. I must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stand at the forefront of the struggle, and, together with the workers and peasants of the whole country, fiercely fire at the "Sanjiacun" gang, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate this anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend the proletarian seal!

    Serve the Chinese People and the World's People "Completely" and "Thoroughly" for Life

    May 18, 1963
    A revolutionary soldier must always remember that he is here to make revolution and serve the people. Regardless of whether the leader is in sight or not, regardless of whether there is anyone supervising, we must work actively, study hard, abide by discipline, and safeguard revolutionary interests....

    February 23, 1964
    A person's life should be to do more work for mankind, and it is shameful to only plan for oneself.

    May 1, 1964
    Without people walking, roads will not become roads. Without people doing, wood will not become tables. Good environments and conditions need people to create. Without road builders, trains and cars will not run on them. I am willing to be a railway soldier for the rest of my life, paving the way for the people.

    June 2, 1964
    Every living person should think of others everywhere. If you are like this, he is like this, and I am like this, then we can embody the close relationship of everyone for me and I for everyone.

    September 26, 1964
    When the people need us to sacrifice ourselves, we should consciously and happily dedicate everything we have and our precious lives. This is the most fundamental condition and the noblest quality that our revolutionary soldiers must possess.

    November 29, 1964
    Correct criticism must be accepted unconditionally. We cannot think it is not good-looking, nor can we be afraid of losing face. If you are afraid of losing face, you are not a good revolutionary. Let us remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "As long as we persist in what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our team will surely prosper."

    January 19, 1965
    I have repeatedly studied the article *Serve the People* many times and have been greatly educated. Today, I reread it carefully and still feel very kind.
    I feel that the issue of serving the people is of paramount importance to us revolutionary soldiers at all times. Is it to serve the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants? Or is it to serve the few landlords and rich peasants in the world? This is the first question that our revolutionary soldiers must clarify.
    Chairman Mao especially pointed out that serving the people must be done "completely" and "thoroughly." The "completely" and "thoroughly" here means serving the people wholeheartedly, not half-heartedly. I must not only be a domestic revolutionary, but also an international revolutionary, like Bethune, taking (supporting) the liberation cause of other countries as my own responsibility. I must always care about the revolutionary struggles of all revolutionary people in the world and dedicate my life to the liberation cause of the people of the world.
    The length of a lifetime cannot explain the value of a person's life. As long as you serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly" for life, it is a shining life.
    Zhang Side, Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, etc., all spent a short and shining life, a great life. They truly put their limited lives into the unlimited cause of serving the people. I want to be a revolutionary for the rest of my life.

    February 3, 1965
    I repeatedly studied the article *Serve the People* and understood the issue of the communist worldview, understood what people live for and who they should serve.
      Chairman Mao also taught us that when dealing with all issues of right and wrong, we must proceed from the interests of the people and take the interests of the people (as) the standard for judging right and wrong. We must insist on doing whatever is beneficial to the people, and we must oppose whatever is detrimental to the people. I think that whether a person can put the interests of the people first when dealing with issues of right and wrong is an important sign of whether a person serves the people wholeheartedly. We should use Chairman Mao's teachings as the criterion for checking our own thoughts and actions.

    February 21, 1965
    I am a People's soldier, defending the sacred territory of the motherland and participating in national defense construction is glorious. More importantly, we are railway soldiers, traveling all over the inland and border areas of the motherland. We should take the company as our home and do our work well. I want to establish the idea that wherever I go, that is my home, and ask myself to be like Bethune, to be a domestic and international revolutionary, and to dedicate my life to the people.

    December 8, 1965
    Today, I studied the article *In Memory of Bethune* and felt particularly kind and received a profound education. Through comparison before and after and repeated checks, I realized that I had produced a sense of self-pity, which is a bad idea and must be corrected immediately. At the same time, it also increased my strong will and confidence to overcome injuries and illnesses. I want to be a revolutionary soldier who is disabled but not discouraged.
    When I was injured, the doctor told me that I would be well in more than two months, and I still had the confidence to overcome my injuries and illnesses. However, after two treatments with no effect, I developed a sense of self-pity. I thought that I was young and would be finished like this. How would I work and live in the future? Others are enthusiastically participating in socialist construction. Am I just going to lie down like this? At this time, I relived the article *In Memory of Bethune*. When I read: "We must all learn his spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self. Starting from this point, we can become a person who is greatly beneficial to the people. A person's ability is large or small...", at this time, my heart suddenly opened up and I felt that self-pity was too terrible. It is not something that a revolutionary soldier should have, let alone a Communist Party member. A Communist Party member should have the spirit of revolutionary optimism. Although my leg is broken, I still have two hands! With two hands, I can still work for the Party and the people. If I can't do heavy work, I can do light work. As long as I have a spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self, as long as I wholeheartedly do "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, what does it matter if I am disabled? As long as my ambition is not broken, I can still be "a person who is beneficial to the people."

    Happy to Endure the Greatest Hardships for the People, Promoting Ideological Revolutionization Through Labor

    March 11, 1963
    Whether a person can endure hardship, whether he can do what he says, whether he sincerely listens to the Party and Chairman Mao, needs to be tested in the most difficult and arduous environment and conditions. Being able to withstand it is a true, strong, brave, and fearless person.

    March 12, 1963
    We work for socialism, making people feel infinite happiness and joy. Our motherland's resources are endless, and the future of our country's construction is infinitely beautiful. Our work is very meaningful. Any emotions that are afraid of hardship, despise labor, express pessimism, and cannot see the bright future of socialism are essentially a reflection of the decadent bourgeois ideology.

    February 13, 1964
    Today is the first day of the lunar new year, which is the first year (Spring Festival) I have spent since joining the army. It was spent in the forest area. What we are comparing now is not who eats well or wears well, but who can endure hardship and who is the most hardworking and simple. We also yearn for a better life, which requires us to endure some hardship now so that the people of the motherland can live a good and happy life, which is our greatest happiness and greatest joy.
    We are a little bitter now. There are high mountains and dense forests everywhere, and the snow is more than two feet deep. The temperature reaches below forty-three degrees Celsius or even below fifty-two degrees at some times. What is even more difficult is that this place is not our destination. We also have to walk thirteen kilometers through the snowy mountains. Everything has to be carried by people. It really hurts our waists and legs, and we are very tired! This is the difficulty in front of us, which we can overcome. We must think of the scene of the railway being opened and we must think of the future!

     February 25, 1964
    "Whoever only sees the bright side and does not see the difficult side will not be able to fight well for the realization of the Party's tasks."
    Chairman Mao's words are of profound significance to us young people. We live in a happy era, and our lives are beautiful and happy. We do not understand the past bitter days. Therefore, our understanding of life is often not comprehensive. Today, studying Chairman Mao's words made me clear in my heart and bright in my eyes. It made me understand that we must not only see the bright side of anything, but also see its difficult side. Only in this way can we fight well for the realization of the Party's tasks.
    Studying Chairman Mao's words also made me understand that we must not only see the difficult side of anything, but also see its bright side. Combining the two well can we fight for the realization of the Party's tasks.

    December 31, 1964
    Labor, especially physical labor, is the best way for us young people to revolutionize. It can transform non-proletarian ideology and enhance proletarian ideology. The more we participate in labor, the more we can promote the revolutionary spirit of hard work and plain living, enduring great hardships and hard work, self-reliance, and striving for progress. The more we participate in labor, the more we will establish deep feelings for the working people. Our thinking is easy to transform, and maintaining the health of our thinking can better be revolutionized through labor.

    March 1, 1965
    Difficulty is also a paper tiger. I just participated in construction and felt nervous, but I gritted my teeth and continued to work. Labor did not exhaust me. On the contrary, it strengthened my will and trained me to have the courage to overcome difficulties.
    Chairman Mao taught us: Strategically, we must despise the enemy, and tactically, we must value the enemy. It is the same with hard work. Whenever arduous tasks come, we are determined to complete it! Having such a mental will is not enough. We must also have relatively mature preparations and measures in each specific task. Only in this way can we complete the task more smoothly.
    I want to use all my strength to work, and I want to go to the most difficult places. I want to dare to fight against difficulties.
    For (going to) difficult places, I want to sign up first, putting myself in those conditions, so that I can train myself to be a strong revolutionary soldier.

    January 5, 1966
    Chairman Mao taught us: "The establishment of the socialist system has opened up a road to the ideal realm for us, and the realization of the ideal realm still depends on our hard work." Yes, we are happy and proud to grow up in the Mao Zedong era. But can we stand still on the happy road? No, absolutely not! We must work hard on the happy road to create a happier life and make our country more prosperous and beautiful. (Attached picture)

    Comrade Zhang Chunyu (left), during his hospitalization, always insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works, promoting Mao Zedong Thought, and also wrote many experiences with strong perseverance. This is him studying Chairman Mao's works with medical staff after his condition improved.

### 毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳——铁道兵某部副班长张春玉同志日记摘抄

    毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳
    ——铁道兵某部副班长张春玉同志日记摘抄
    《解放军报》编者按：用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，最无私，最勇敢，最坚强，是最大的战斗力。
    在我们这个时代，一切英雄模范人物的成长，无一不是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的结果，无一不是活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫的结果。雷锋、王杰、麦贤得是这样，张春玉也是这样。
    张春玉同志和千千万万工农兵群众一样，热爱党，热爱毛主席，把毛泽东思想比作心中的红太阳。那些资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，妄图实现资本主义复辟的可耻阴谋，他们极端仇视毛泽东思想，左一个“庸俗化”，右一个“简单化”，千方百计地阻挠和恶毒地反对工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作。他们这是枉费心机。张春玉和广大工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作的行动，给了他们最有力的回击。
    毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会成为威力无穷的精神原子弹。张春玉这个普普通通的青年战士，学习了毛主席著作，精神世界立刻发生了巨大的变化。他按照毛主席的教导，改造自己的世界观，决心完全彻底地为中国人民和世界人民服务一生。他立下誓言：我这一辈子，愿作一把泥土、一块石子、一根枕木，铺在通往共产主义的大道上，让革命的列车从我身上通过，全速前进。毛主席说到哪里，他就坚决做到哪里。他乐于为人民吃最大的苦，不断在劳动中改造自己。正因为这样，他才能够在平时出色地完成任务，在危急的时刻，奋不顾身，英勇抢救战友，做出了不愧为毛主席的好战士的英雄行为。
    张春玉同志说，不要忘记阶级斗争，要站在阶级斗争的最前列，敢于在各种形式的阶级斗争中与敌人较量。这是他学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争指示的深刻体会，也是他在阶级斗争中的鲜明立场。当前，我国正在进行的社会主义文化大革命，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。我们应当有张春玉同志这样的鲜明的态度，积极参加这个斗争，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，彻底粉碎那些反党反社会主义的黑帮，同时改造自己的主观世界。
    张春玉同志在几年来的刻苦锻炼中，写下了不少的学习毛主席著作的心得体会和日记。这里摘录的是其中的一部分。为了便于大家阅读，我们作了一些删节，分了类，加了小标题。
    心中有颗红太阳前进路上无阻挡
    一九六三年七月一日
    今天是伟大的中国共产党的生日。远在一九二一年的今天，我们的党成立了，领导全国人民，打倒了敌人，夺取了胜利，建立了今天的幸福生活。
    我生活在这样幸福中，万分地感谢党和伟大的领袖毛主席。我现在是一个光荣的人民战士，要在保卫祖国的岗位上做出成绩来，争当毛主席的好战士。我要坚决做到：
    1、阶级立场坚定，爱憎分明，永不忘本，忠于党和毛主席，忠于人类解放事业。
    2、处处以党的利益为重，处处从革命需要出发，决心做个“永不生锈的螺丝钉”，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。
    3、树立艰苦朴素，克勤克俭，毫不利己，专门利人的共产主义高尚品德。
    4、努力学习毛主席著作，自觉接受党的教育，严格要求自己，认真自我改造，树立好学上进的思想。
     一九六三年十二月七日
    庄稼生长要有阳光，革命战士没有毛泽东思想武装，就会迷失方向。（好八连战士学习心得）
    这是一条真理。只要努力去这样做，那么，我们会勇往直前。只要用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑，那么，我们会为党、为人民做好每一件事。我要牢记这个真理。
    一九六四年四月三日
    我们学习毛主席著作，要经常反复地学习，要象奔流不息的江水一样，春流到夏，秋流到冬，从不停一时。
    一九六四年七月×日
    去年三月份，我应征入伍了。但当时服役的目的不够明确，为啥当兵呢？当个什么样的兵呢？心里不清楚。后来我学习了雷锋的事迹，对我的鼓舞很大。我想：人家雷锋为什么能做得这样好呢？一些事，平时我也碰到过呀！为啥自己就做不到呢？我深思再深思，原因找到了，最根本的是（雷锋）听党和毛主席的话，用毛泽东思想武装了头脑。从此，我就更加热爱毛主席著作了。
    只有把毛主席著作学习好，才能在大风大浪里站得稳，才能辨明是非，不失方向，站稳无产阶级立场，才能握紧我们手中的武器，才能捍卫我们的政权，才能将革命进行到底。
    一九六五年一月九日
    毛主席著作是我们每一个战士不可缺少的精神食粮。只有认真地学习了毛主席著作，用毛主席的思想武装了头脑，才能谈得上“红”。我认为在工作中，时间越紧，工作越忙，担子越重，越是要“红”字当头，思想领先。只有思想红，才能战胜困难，取得胜利。
     一九六五年一月十五日
    毛主席教导我们说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”
    什么人说什么话，有什么思想就会做出什么事情。我们要不断进行兴无灭资的斗争，认真学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。
     一九六六年二月十日
     你问为啥乐观、欢畅？
     只因我心中有一颗红太阳。
     照得我前后左右亮堂堂，
     前进路上无阻挡。永远不忘阶级斗争站在阶级斗争前列
     一九六三年三月二十九日
    当我在看《血泪》这本书里每一个真实而又悲痛的故事的时候，眼泪情不自禁掉在书上。我是一个无产阶级的革命战士，怎不为阶级兄弟所受的苦而悲痛呢？怎不憎恨压迫阶级兄弟的三大敌人呢？我高呼：“为死难的烈士们报仇！”“解放台湾受苦受难的同胞们！”
    一九六三年五月十二日
    对付无形的政治思想上的敌人，比对付有形的敌人，需要更高的革命警惕性。资产阶级的思想侵蚀、影响是潜移默化的，如不高度地提高警惕性，自觉地加以抵制，就会使人不知不觉地沾染上资产阶级思想，消蚀革命意志，严重的甚至腐化堕落，蜕化变质。
                                            （读书报摘记）
    一九六四年一月二十二日
    我是穷人家生长大的孩子，我之所以能长这么大，上这么多年的学（十一年），得到这样的幸福，那是毛主席和共产党给的。我一定要牢牢地记在心里，听毛主席的话，坚信党的领导，站稳无产阶级立场，坚决地走无产阶级道路，牢记过去的痛苦生活，牢记阶级仇，阶级恨，不忘本。要牢记阶级斗争，增强阶级斗争观念，向一切牛鬼蛇神作斗争。
    一九六四年九月二十二日
    毛主席说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。这是毛主席用阶级分析的方法得出的科学结论，也是在革命斗争中被千百次实践所证明了的真理。我们学习主席这篇文章，就要学习文章中所体现的坚定的无产阶级立场和大无畏的革命精神、革命胆略，使我们在当前的国内外阶级斗争中看得清，站得稳，顶得住。
    现在世界上充满阶级斗争。帝国主义反对我们，国内被打倒的阶级敌人在反对我们，而现代修正主义者则越来越露骨地与帝国主义和反动的民族主义者勾结在一起，拚命地反对我们。面对这种形势，我们要牢记毛主席的教导，清楚地认识到被它们反对是好事，而不是坏事。他们越是起劲地反对我们，越是把我们骂得一无是处，这恰恰是证明了我们社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业办得很有成绩。
    我们既不要忘记阶级斗争，也不要怕阶级斗争，要敢于在各种形式的阶级斗争中与敌人较量。
    一九六四年十一月九日
    “捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。”另一条是：“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    有了这两条马列主义的定律，我们对帝国主义和一切反动派了解的更彻底。不论它以张牙舞爪的老虎面目出现，还是以披着羊皮的伪装出现，他们的本性是始终如一的。
    有了这两条定律，我们对人民革命的力量认识更清楚，就会对人民的力量和斗争前途充满信心，最后总会推翻统治阶级，战胜帝国主义。
     一九六五年四月一日至三日
    （美）帝国主义在朝鲜战争吃了败仗，现在又在越南发动新战争。它发动战争并不说明它强大，而正说明了它的虚弱，是在作临死的挣扎，最终是要失败的。它是不见棺材不落泪的。帝国主义的侵略本性是改变不了的。（它）现在在越南发动侵略战争，我们作为革命战士是不能不管的，我们有责任帮助他们（越南）争取解放，消灭帝国主义，保卫世界和平。我现在做好了一切准备，只要祖国和越南人民需要，我就拿起枪杆，挺身而出，消灭美帝国主义，保卫越南和世界和平。
     一九六六年一月五日
    我们青年人对于阶级压迫认识不深，这就要我们努力学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的学说。社会主义教育就是我们青年人学习阶级斗争的最好课堂，我们要置身于这火热的斗争之中，把自己锻炼的更坚强。
    一九六六年五月十一日
    电影《兵临城下》是一部美化敌人的坏影片。凭姜部长和敌人称兄道弟，敌人就会起义吗？这是不可能的。整个舞台上都是敌人，看不见我们的人。没有我们的重兵围城，敌人能起义吗？那是绝不可能的。敌人抢老百姓的东西，当官的还叫送回去，那有这样的事？把敌人当成好人，那就是没有分清敌我。影片是没有分清敌我的，把敌人说得很美，而对我们只字不提。毛主席教导我们说，敌人不能放下屠刀，更不能立地成佛。而影片反对毛泽东思想，说敌人可以放下屠刀，可以立地成佛。我们坚决拔掉这棵毒草，决不上他们的当！
    一九六六年五月二十二日
    我躺在病床养伤，从报纸上、广播里知道了邓拓一伙反党反社会主义的罪行，特别是听到了他们最猖狂、最恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党，煽动我们青年不要读毛主席的书、听毛主席的话的时候，气得我躺不住，卧不安，非拿起笔来同他们干不行。
    邓拓这个挂着共产党员招牌的叛徒，竟敢明目张胆地反对我们青年读毛主席的书，狂妄地企图摘掉我们的“显微镜”，让我们戴上资产阶级的黑色眼镜，分不清是非，辨不清敌友，为资本主义复辟准备精神条件。我们是毛泽东时代的青年，决不会上你们这些家伙的当。
    我们革命青年，对伟大的毛泽东思想从来就是无限的信赖。我们从革命实践中深刻地体会到，听毛主席的话，信仰毛泽东思想，就是信赖革命，信仰真理。不管在任何时候都坚信不疑，坚定不移，坚决按最高指示办事。我们不靠天，不靠地，靠的就是毛泽东思想。毛主席怎样说的，我们就怎么做。我们革命青年，命可舍，血可流，毛主席的话一定要听，毛主席说一点，我就照着做一点，毛主席说到哪里，我就坚决做到哪里。
    我出身在一个贫苦的农民家庭，在旧社会过着牛马不如的生活，是党和毛主席把我从苦海中解救出来的。我参军以后，在党和毛主席思想的哺育下，成了一个光荣的共产党员。负伤以后，党给我安排了最好的医疗条件，我的伤迅速好转，是党和毛主席给了我第二次生命，我从心眼里热爱党，热爱毛主席。邓拓黑帮攻击我们伟大的党和我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，恶毒攻击毛泽东思想，这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。我一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，站在斗争的最前列，和全国工农群众一道，向“三家村”黑帮猛烈开火，坚决彻底地搞掉这条反党反社会主义的黑线，捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫无产阶级的印把子！
    “完全”“彻底”地为中国人民和世界人民服务一生
    一九六三年五月十八日
    一个革命战士，要时刻记住自己是来革命的，是为人民服务的。不管领导在不在眼前，不管有没有人监督，都要积极工作，努力学习，遵守纪律，维护革命利益……。
    一九六四年二月二十三日
    人的一生应是为人类多做一些工作，光为个人打算那是可耻的。
    一九六四年五月一日
    没有人走，道不会成路。没有人做，木头不会成桌子。好的环境和条件需要人去创造。没有筑路的人，火车、汽车不会在上面奔跑，我愿干一辈子铁道兵，为人（民）铺路。
    一九六四年六月二日
    每一个活着的人，应做到处处为别人着想。你是这样，他是这样，我也这样，这样才能体现我为人人的亲切关系。
    一九六四年九月二十六日
    当人民需要我们自我牺牲时，我们应自觉的、愉快的献出个人的一切及宝贵的生命，这是我们革命战士必须具备的最根本的条件，也是最高尚的品质。
    一九六四年十一月二十九日
    正确的批评，一定要无条件的接受，不能认为是一种不好看，不能怕丢脸。怕丢脸，就不是一个好的革命者。让我们牢记毛主席教导吧：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”
    一九六五年一月十九日
    我曾多次反复学习了《为人民服务》这篇文章，受到了巨大的教益。今天我又重新认真地学习，仍然感到十分亲切。
    我觉得为人民服务的问题，对我们革命战士来说，到何时都有头等重要的意义。是为工人阶级和贫下中农服务呢？还是为世界上少数的地主富农服务呢？这是我们革命战士首先要明确的问题。
    毛主席特别提出，为人民服务要做到“完全”和“彻底”，这里的“完全”和“彻底”，就是要全心全意为人民服务，而不是半心半意。我不仅要做国内革命派，而且要做国际革命派，象白求恩那样，把（支援）别国的解放事业当作自己的责任。我要时刻关心世界一切革命人民的革命斗争，把自己的一生贡献给世界人民的解放事业。
    一生的长短，不能说明一个人生命的价值。只要是“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务一生，就是闪闪发光的一生。
    张思德、董存瑞、黄继光、雷锋等都度过了短短的闪闪发光的一生，是伟大的一生，他们真正做到了把有限的生命投入到无限的为人民服务的事业中。我要干一辈子革命。
    一九六五年二月三日
    我反复地学习了《为人民服务》这篇文章，明白了共产主义世界观这个问题，明白了人活着究竟为了什么，应该为谁服务。
      毛主席还教导我们，对待一切是非问题，都要从人民的利益出发，以人民利益（作为）判断是非的标准。凡是对人民有
  利的事，我们一定要坚持去做，凡是对人民不利的事，一定反
  对。我看，一个人对待是非问题，是否能以人民的利益为重，是衡量一个人是否全心全意为人民服务的一个重要标志。我们应以毛主席的教导，作为检查自己思想和行动的准则。
    一九六五年二月二十一日
    我是一个人民战士，保卫祖国神圣领土，参加国防建设，是光荣的。更主要的我们是铁道兵，走遍祖国的内地、边疆，我们应以连队为家，干好工作。我要树立走到那里，那里就是我的家的思想，要求自己象白求恩那样，做一个国内和国际的革命派，把自己的一生贡献给人民。
    一九六五年十二月八日
    今天，我学习了《纪念白求恩》这篇文章，感到特别亲切，受到了一次深刻的教育。通过前后对照，反复检查，使我认识到我产生了自悲感，这是一种坏的思想，必须马上改正。同时也使我增加了战胜伤病的坚强意志和信心。我要做个身残志不残的革命战士。
    当我受伤之后，医生告诉我两个多月就可以好时，我还有信心战胜伤病。但是，经过两次治疗毫无效果时，我曾产生了自悲感。认为自己年轻轻的就这样完了，将来怎么工作、生活呢？别人都轰轰烈烈地参加社会主义建设，难道我就这样躺下去吗？就在这时，我重温了《纪念白求恩》这篇文章，当我读到：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小……”这时，我的心豁然开阔了，感到自悲感太可怕了。不是一个革命战士应有的，更不是一个共产党员应有的。一个共产党员应具有革命的乐观主义的精神，我的腿虽说坏了，但我还有两只手啊！两只手，还可以为党为人民工作。不能做重的，可以做轻的。只要有毫无自私自利的精神，只要一心一意做到“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，身残那有什么呢？只要我的志不残，仍然可以做“一个有益于人民的人”。
    乐于为人民吃最大的苦通过劳动促进思想革命化
    一九六三年三月十一日
    一个人是不是能吃苦，是不是说到那里做到那里，是不是真心的听党和毛主席的话，需要在最艰苦、最困难的环境和条件下来考验自己。经得住，才是一个真正的、坚强的、勇敢的、大无畏的人。
    一九六三年三月十二日
    我们为社会主义劳动，使人们感到无限幸福、愉快。我们祖国的资源是无穷无尽的，我们国家的建设前途是无限美丽的。我们的工作是非常有意义的。任何害怕艰苦，轻视劳动，表示悲观，看不到社会主义光明前途的情绪，本质上都是没落的资产阶级思想意识的反映。
    一九六四年二月十三日
    今天是阴历大年初一，这是我参军后过的第一个年（春节）。是在林区度过的。我们现在比的不是谁吃得好、穿得好，而是要看谁能吃苦，谁最艰苦朴素。我们也向往更美好的生活，那就要我们现在吃点苦，使祖国人民过上美好幸福的日子，那才是我们最大的幸福，最大的快乐。
    我们现在是苦些，到处是高山、密林，积雪足有二尺多深，气温达零下四十三度以上，有一时期达零下五十二度。更困难的是，这地方不是我们的目的地，我们还要步行十三公里的雪山，东西都要人背，走一趟真是腰疼腿痠，累得很啊！这是眼前的困难，我们是能克服的，我们要想到铁路修通的情景，我们要想到未来！
     一九六四年二月二十五日
    “谁要是只看见光明一面，不看见困难一面，谁就会不能很好地为实现党的任务而斗争。”
    毛主席的这句话对我们青年人来说意义深重，我们生活在幸福的时代，我们的生活是美好的、幸福的。我们对过去的苦日子是不懂得的。所以，我们对生活的认识往往是不全面的。今天，学习了毛主席的话，使我心里明、眼里亮。使我懂得了，对任何事物不只要看到光明的一面，而且也要看到它困难的一面。只有这样，才能很好地为实现党的任务而斗争。
    学习毛主席的这句话，我也懂得了，对任何事物，不光要看到困难的一面，而且也要看到它光明的一面。二者结合好，才能为实现党的任务而斗争。
    一九六四年十二月三十一日
    劳动，特别是体力劳动，是我们青年革命化的最好途径。能改造非无产阶级思想，增强无产阶级思想。我们越是参加劳动，越能发扬艰苦朴素，吃大苦耐大劳，自力更生，奋发图强的革命精神。越是参加劳动，就会对劳动人民建立浓厚的感情。我们的思想就易改造，保持思想的健康，就能更好地通过劳动化而革命化。
    一九六五年三月一日
    困难也是一只纸老虎。我才参加施工，感到是紧张的，但硬着头皮干下去，劳动并没有把我累垮，相反，却使我锻炼的意志坚强，练出了克服困难的勇气。
    毛主席教导我们：战略上要藐视敌人，战术上要重视敌人。对待艰苦的劳动也是一样，每当艰巨的任务来了之后，我们就下决心，一定要完成它！有了这样的思想意志还不行，还要在每一项具体工作上有比较成熟的准备和措施。这样才能比较顺利地完成任务。
    我要拿出所有的力量去工作，越是艰苦的地方越是要去，我要敢于向困难作斗争。
    对于（去）艰苦的地方要报第一名，把自己放在那样的条件下，才能把自己锻炼成为一个坚强的革命战士。
    一九六六年一月五日
    毛主席教导我们说：“社会主义制度的建立给我们开辟了一条到达理想境界的道路，而理想境界的实现还要靠我们的辛勤劳动。”是的，我们生长在毛泽东时代是幸福的，自豪的。但是我们能站在幸福的道路上不动吗？不能，决不能！我们要在幸福的道路上辛勤劳动，创造更幸福的生活，使我们的国家更富强、更美丽。（附图片）
