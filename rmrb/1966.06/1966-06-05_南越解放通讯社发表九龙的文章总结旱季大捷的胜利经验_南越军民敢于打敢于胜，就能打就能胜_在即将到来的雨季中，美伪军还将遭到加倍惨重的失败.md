    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd—The South Vietnam Liberation News Agency published a commentary on May 28th, signed by Jiulong, titled "The Flames of People's War Burn Down the Enemy's Dry Season Offensive," pointing out that the American aggressors' most disastrous failure in the dry season is primarily the failure of their aggressive war strategy.

    The commentary pointed out that, in the past, imperialists consistently believed that the United States, relying on the world's most powerful air and naval forces, had sufficient capacity to overwhelm the South Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. However, facts have proven that the American weapon of a paper tiger has lost its effectiveness.

    The commentary also pointed out that, in the world, many people believe that the American army, with its powerful mechanized equipment, is bound to greatly surpass the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces in terms of mobility. But the truth is: those with fast weapons and equipment are slow, while those who seem slow are exceptionally agile and clever. The Liberation Army has created magical mobility with its own feet. There is nothing mysterious about this; it ultimately comes down to the human spirit. Because they dare to fight, they will find good ways to fight and will fight brilliantly.

    In this dry season battle, the Liberation Army is like a veteran chess player, with only pawns and knights in hand, while the enemy has rooks and cannons. Yet we are still able to lead the opponent into our carefully arranged layout, forcing the enemy to send cannons into the mouths of our pawns and push rooks under the feet of our knights. Everything the American army fears (such as fearing forests, fearing night battles, fearing close combat), the Liberation Army has ways to make them die from these things. The traditional tactics of people's war, such as raids, ambushes, mobile warfare, and positional attacks, have been actively developed and continuously innovated by the people and the Liberation Army of the South, giving them Vietnamese characteristics.

    The commentary said that the dry season is a huge test for us. Through the practice of the dry season, we are clearer than ever about the prospects of our cause of resisting aggression and saving the nation.

    The commentary said that in the dry season, some people were anxious about too many American troops coming in. They worried, how can we fight with so many American troops and weapons? Now it is even clearer, we are determined to fight and create conditions to defeat the American army under any circumstances. We have clearly seen that the progress of the war is: after the end of this dry season, our revolutionary forces will be stronger and our experience in fighting the Americans will be richer. Thus, only one thing can happen: the American and accomplice troops will be annihilated more and more, the puppet troops will collapse and disintegrate in larger chunks, and the enemy's rear will be attacked even more severely, making it difficult for the enemy to survive between defense and offense.

    The commentary said that our people have been tested by war for a long time and are very eager for peace, but we have been fighting for more than twenty years and are now prepared to fight for another twenty years to defend the country's independence and sovereignty, and then unify the motherland. The enemy's ranks are becoming increasingly chaotic in political and economic terms; the movement supporting us in the world is rising and becoming stronger, and we have an inexhaustible source of strength. In this way, we will further defeat the enemy's lackey forces, shatter the enemy's aggressive ambitions, and steadily and confidently move towards complete victory. The enemy is issuing desperate wails and struggling frantically, but they themselves are panicked and have lost confidence.

    The commentary said that the 1965-1966 dry season is an important milestone for us, a step towards achieving brilliant victory. The 1965-1966 dry season is the season for burying the American "special war" strategy, the season for the extreme corruption and disintegration of the traitorous Vietnamese group, the season for our defeat of the first stage of the American local war, giving the American expeditionary force an extremely heavy blow. This is the season of the most brilliant victory we have achieved since resisting America, the season of the leapfrog growth of the liberation armed forces and the people's combat forces, the season of mobilizing the national strength to form a combat fortress, for a common purpose—liberating the South, defending the North, and then unifying the motherland, the people of the whole country are more closely united than ever.

    The commentary said that our dry season victory also has extremely great international significance. The people of the world enthusiastically support our people's great war of resistance against the American aggressors and their lackeys. However, in the face of the deceptive rhetoric of the absolute superiority of American air power and weapons touted by American imperialism, many of our friends and brothers also worry: how can we avoid the American's fierce bombs and shells, and how can we deal with more than 200,000 American troops armed to the teeth?

    In fact, we did not start fighting the Americans in 1965. The "man-eating" nature of the American tiger has never changed. The only difference is that in the dying struggle of the United States and its lackeys, the cruelty of the war is becoming more and more intense than in the past. However, in the past period, due to our promotion of the glorious tradition of our nation in resisting foreign aggression, and after twelve years of personal experience, especially after the practice of the recent dry season, the people of our country have sufficient facts to report to our brothers, friends, and the people of the world: "We can fight, we have ways to fight the American aggressors, and we will definitely be able to defeat the American aggressors."

    The commentary said that the dry season has provided us with many valuable experiences. The most important experience that should be mentioned first is the determination of all the people and the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam to dare to fight and dare to win against the American aggressive bandits. While greatly increasing its troops, American imperialism used a huge modern propaganda machine to tout the power of the American army to the people of the world and talk extravagantly about "peace," attempting to deceive world public opinion, intimidate the timid, create chaos among our people, and blur our thinking. Faced with the magic of the fierce god, the Vietnamese people are more calm than ever, hold the weapons in their hands more tightly, and continue to attack the enemy with the momentum of a victor.

    The commentary said that a few years ago, American imperialism, relying on its strong material strength, attempted to extinguish the Southern revolution within eighteen months. But now, eighty months have passed, and the situation in the South has put American imperialism in a situation ten times more difficult than in the past. It has exhausted all its efforts to carry out the "dry season counter-offensive," attempting to salvage the critical situation, but ferocity and madness cannot make it strong, but only weaken it further.

    On our side, we have justice, revolutionary determination, confidence in victory, and we are also strongly supported and encouraged by the people of the world. Therefore, although we still had some weaknesses at the beginning, our position is favorable, so we can continuously achieve one victory after another.

    The commentary said that in the high tide of resisting America and saving the nation, we are more convinced of our own justice and strengthened our determination to win victory. The determination of our people is the invincible power of the majestic Changshan Mountains. We will definitely be able to defeat the American imperialists' local war and "escalation" war. No matter what the situation, no matter how many years we have to fight, we are determined to defeat the American aggressive bandits.

    The commentary said that in the future, on the basis of the dry season victory, the Southern people and the Southern Liberation Army will certainly continue to fight hard, fight small battles, fight medium-sized battles, and fight large battles, annihilating more puppet troops and American aggressors. Steel encirclements will appear in all places where American troops are stationed. Guerrilla warfare will be further developed. We will attack even with one person, with one group, with one team. Only by attacking, resolutely attacking, can we make the American aggressors and puppet troops fall into passivity and bleed wherever they go. Their water and land transportation lines will be divided into pieces. Their rear bases will be frequently shaken by the artillery fire of the Southern Liberation Armed Forces. Armed struggle, political struggle, and troop movement work will be better coordinated and developed more vigorously, jointly submerging the American aggressors and their lackeys in the sea of fire. The commentary concluded by saying that the Southern people and the Southern Liberation Army do not distinguish between seasons when fighting the Americans and fighting the puppet troops. They fight in the rainy season, and they fight in the dry season; they fight in any season, and they achieve victory in any season. In the coming rainy season and dry season, we will resolutely, fiercely, and continuously fight, so that the American aggressors and puppet troops will suffer defeats that are twice as severe and shameful as in the previous rainy season and the previous dry season.

    南越解放通讯社发表九龙的文章总结旱季大捷的胜利经验
    南越军民敢于打敢于胜，就能打就能胜
    在即将到来的雨季中，美伪军还将遭到加倍惨重的失败
    据新华社河内二日电　越南南方解放通讯社五月二十八日发表署名九龙的一篇题为《人民战争的烈火烧毁了敌人的旱季攻势》的评论指出，美国侵略者在旱季中最惨重的失败首先是它的侵略战争战略的失败。
    评论指出，过去，帝国主义一贯相信美国依靠世界上最强大的空军和海军力量，有足够的能力压倒越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争。但是事实证明美国武器纸老虎已经失灵了。
    评论还指出，在世界上，许多人认为，美军以强大的机械化装备，必定在机动性方面大大胜过越南南方解放武装力量。但是事实是：有速度快的武器装备的人，却很慢，看来缓慢的人却异常敏捷和精灵。解放军以自己的双脚造成了神奇的机动性。这并没有什么神秘，归根结底是人的精神因素。因为他们敢打，所以就会找到好的打法，就会打得出色。
    在这次旱季战斗中，解放军象老练的棋手，手中只有卒和马，而敌人有车和炮，然而我们仍然能把对方引入自己安排好的布局，迫使敌人把炮送到我们的卒子的口中，把车推到马的脚下。美军害怕的一切东西（如怕森林，怕打夜战，怕打近战），解放军就有办法使它们死于这些东西。人民战争的传统战术如袭击、伏击、运动战和攻坚战，得到南方人民和解放军积极发展、不断创新，使之带有越南的特点。
    评论说，旱季对我们是一个巨大考验。通过旱季的实践，我们比任何时候都更加清楚地认识到我们抗战救国事业的前途。
    评论说，在旱季中，有些人为美军进来太多而焦虑不安，他们担心，美军人数和武器这么多我们怎能打呢？现在更加“水落石出”了，我们决心要打，并且创造条件要在任何情况下战胜美军。我们已经清楚地看到战争的进展是：在这旱季结束之后，我们的革命力量将更加强大，打美国佬的经验更加丰富。这样就只能发生一种情况：美军和帮凶军越来越被歼得更多，伪军将更大块地崩溃和瓦解，敌人的后方将被袭击得更加严重，使得敌人在防御和进攻的矛盾中难以死里求生。
    评论说，我国人民久经战争的考验，非常殷切希望和平，但我们曾经进行了二十多年的战斗，现在准备再战斗二十年，一定要保卫住国家的独立、主权，进而统一祖国。敌人的队伍在政治和经济方面越来越混乱；世界上支持我们的运动日益高涨和强大，我们有着无穷无尽的力量源泉。就这样，我们将进而击溃敌人的走狗力量，粉碎敌人的侵略野心，稳步和充满信心地走向完全胜利。敌人正在发出绝望的哀叹，疯狂地进行挣扎，但它们本身惊惶失措，失去信心。
    评论说，一九六五——一九六六年旱季是我们的一个重要里程碑，是取得辉煌胜利的一步。一九六五——一九六六年旱季是埋葬美国的“特种战争”战略的季节，是卖国越奸集团极度腐朽、瓦解的季节，是我们击败美国局部战争的第一个阶段的季节，给予了美国远征军一个极其沉重的打击。这是我们从抗美以来取得最辉煌胜利的季节，是解放武装力量和人民战斗力量飞跃成长的季节，是动员全国力量，形成战斗堡垒的季节，为了一个共同目的——解放南方、保卫北方、进而统一祖国，全国人民比任何时候都更加紧密地团结。
    评论说，我们的旱季胜利还有极其巨大的国际意义。世界人民非常热情支持我国人民进行反对美国侵略者及其走狗的伟大的抗战。但是在美帝国主义所吹嘘的美国空军和武器的绝对优势的欺骗论调面前，我们的许多朋友和兄弟也担心：我们怎么能够避免美国猛烈的炸弹和炮弹，怎么能够对付武装到牙齿的二十多万美军呢？
    其实，我们并不是到一九六五年才同美国佬打仗，美国老虎的“吃人”本质从来就没有变过。不同的是，在美国及其走狗作垂死挣扎的今天，战争的残酷程度比过去越来越加深罢了。但是，在过去的一段时间里，由于我们发扬了我们民族抗击外侮的光荣传统，又经过十二年的亲身体验，尤其是经过最近旱季的实践，我国人民已有充分的事实向我们的兄弟、朋友和世界人民汇报说：“我们能够打，我们有办法打美国侵略者，并且一定能够打败美国侵略者。”
    评论说，旱季给我们提供了许多宝贵的经验，首先应该谈到的最重要的一条经验是，越南南方全体人民和解放武装力量对美国侵略强盗的敢于战斗、敢于胜利的决心。美帝国主义一面大举增兵，一面用庞大的现代化宣传机构，向世界人民吹嘘美国军队的威力和侈谈“和平”，妄图欺骗世界舆论，恫吓胆怯的人，在我国人民当中制造混乱，使我们的思想模糊。面对着凶神的妖法，越南人民比过去任何时候都更加沉着，更加握紧手中的武器，继续以胜利者的气势进攻敌人。
    评论说，几年前，美帝国主义依着自己的强大物质力量，妄图在十八个月内扑灭南方革命。但是到现在，时间已经过去八十个月，南方的形势却使美帝国主义处在比过去困难十倍的境况中。它倾尽全力进行“旱季反攻”，妄图挽救危局，可是凶狠和疯狂不能使它强大，而只有使它更加削弱。
    在我们这方面，我们有正义，有革命决心，有胜利的信心，又得到世界人民的大力支持和鼓舞。因此，我们开头虽然还有一些弱点，但我们所处的地位有利，所以能够接连不断地取得一个又一个胜利。
    评论说，在抗美救国高潮中，使我们更加相信自己的正义性，并且加强了夺取胜利的决心。我们全国人民的决心是雄伟的长山的无敌力量，我们一定能够打败美帝国主义的局部战争和“升级”战争，无论是在什么情况下，无论要打多少年，我们也一心坚决战胜美国侵略强盗。
    评论说，今后，在旱季胜利的基础上，南方人民和南方解放军一定将继续狠狠地打，打小仗，打中等规模的仗，打大仗，歼灭更多的伪军和美国侵略军。钢铁包围圈将在驻扎有美军的所有各个地方出现。游击战争将进一步发展。一个人，我们也进攻，一个组，也进攻，一队，也进攻。只有进攻，坚决地进攻，使美国侵略军和伪军走到哪里都陷于被动，都要流血。它们的水陆交通线将被分割得支离破碎。它们的后方基地将为南方解放武装力量的炮火经常动摇。武装斗争、政治斗争和兵运工作将更好地配合，更大力地发展，共同把美国侵略者及其走狗淹没在火海之中。评论最后说，南方人民和南方解放军打美国佬和打伪军是不分季节的。雨季打，旱季也打；什么季节都打，什么季节都取得胜利。在即将到来的雨季和旱季中，我们将坚决狠狠地、连续地打，使美国侵略军和伪军遭到比前一个雨季和前一个旱季加倍惨重和可耻的失败。（附图片）
