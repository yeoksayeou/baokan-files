    Dominican People's Movement Organ Praises the CCP for Holding High the Banner of Anti-Revisionism
    CCP Headed by Mao Zedong is the Vanguard of the International Communist Movement
    Modern Revisionists Attempt to Replace the Proletarian Revolutionary Line with the Bourgeois Line
    Xinhua News Agency, June 6th—The Dominican People's Movement's theoretical organ, "Red Flag," published an article pointing out that the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, is the vanguard of the international communist movement, while the leading group of the CPSU is the vanguard of international modern revisionism.
    The article, titled "Leninism and Revisionism," was published in the first issue of "Red Flag" magazine this February. The article stated that Lenin, the first Marxist in the era of imperialism, had theoretically and in practical struggles exposed and defeated the revisionists. "Today, as in the era of the great Lenin, it is up to us to deliver a decisive blow to modern revisionism."
    The article said that Leninism is Marxism that entered the stage of imperialism of capitalism, "therefore, modern revisionists aim all their fire at Leninism."
    The article said that the current struggle against modern revisionism is due to the "rampancy of revisionism in the Soviet Union." The leading group of the CPSU "is the vanguard of international revisionism." Today, the Chinese Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong "has become the vanguard of the international communist movement."
    The article went on to say that the basic tenets of class struggle have now been tampered with by revisionists. "They attempt to replace the party, which Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin discussed as the vanguard of the working class, with bourgeois organizations. To this end, they put forward the argument of the 'party of the whole people'."
    The article condemned modern revisionists for attempting to replace the proletarian revolutionary line with the bourgeois line. The article said, "They desperately deny that violence is a universal law of proletarian revolution," "They forget that the exploiting classes and their systems are the root cause of revolutionary violence, and that revolutionary violence is a response to exploitation and reactionary violence."
    The article pointed out that in foreign policy, modern revisionists are opposed to Leninism's proletarian internationalism, taking "peaceful coexistence" as the basic principle of foreign policy. In terms of the concept of the state, they strongly oppose the proletarian concept of the state, namely, the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and uphold the "supra-class" concept of the state, serving the interests of the bourgeoisie.
    The article emphasized: "The Soviet revisionists promote the argument of the 'state of the whole people' in order to disarm the Soviet proletariat of Marxist-Leninist viewpoints, so as to facilitate their task of reverting to capitalism. In addition, they talk a lot about people's power on this issue, but do not talk about which class is leading, which is precisely the decisive factor. They distort Mao Zedong's argument about the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the proletariat."
    The article pointed out: "Revisionism is not a national phenomenon, but an international phenomenon, a socio-historical phenomenon. It is the bourgeois ideology that has infiltrated the workers' movement." The article pointed out that the "domestic root cause of revisionism is the influence of the bourgeoisie, and the external root cause is imperialism."
    The article concluded by saying that now, "a relentless struggle is unfolding in the world against those who desperately distort and revise the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, and history has predetermined that these people are doomed to perish."

    多米尼加人民运动机关刊称赞中共高举反修大旗
    以毛泽东为首的中共是国际共运先锋
    现代修正主义者企图用资产阶级路线代替无产阶级革命路线
    新华社六日讯　多米尼加人民运动机关理论刊物《红旗》发表文章指出，以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党是国际共产主义运动的先锋，而苏共领导集团是国际现代修正主义的先锋。
    这篇题为《列宁主义和修正主义》的文章刊登在今年二月份《红旗》杂志第一期上。文章说，帝国主义时代的第一个马克思主义者列宁曾经在理论上和实际斗争中揭露和击败了修正主义者。“今天，与伟大列宁时代相同，应由我们给予现代修正主义以决定性打击。”
    文章说，列宁主义是资本主义进入帝国主义阶段的马克思主义，“所以，现代修正主义者把所有的炮火都对准列宁主义。”
    文章说，目前反对现代修正主义的斗争是由于修正主义在“苏联的泛滥而引起的。”苏共领导集团“是国际修正主义的先锋”。今天，以毛泽东为首的中国共产党“成了国际共产主义运动的先锋”。
    文章接着说，阶级斗争的基本论点现在被修正主义者篡改了。“他们企图用资产阶级的组织来代替马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林所论述的作为工人阶级先锋队的党，为此，他们提出了‘全民党’的论点”。
    文章谴责现代修正主义者企图用资产阶级的路线代替无产阶级的革命路线。文章说，“他们极力否认暴力是无产阶级革命的普遍规律”，“他们忘记了剥削阶级及其制度是造成革命暴力的根源，革命暴力是对剥削和反动暴力的一种回答”。
    文章指出，现代修正主义者在对外政策上，同列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义相对立，把“和平共处”作为对外政策的基本原则；在国家观念上，他们极力反对无产阶级关于国家的概念，即无产阶级专政的学说，维护“超阶级的”国家观念，为资产阶级的利益服务。
    文章强调说：“苏联修正主义者宣扬‘全民国家’的论点，是为了解除苏联无产阶级的马克思列宁主义论点的武装，以便于他们完成倒退到资本主义的任务。另外，他们在这个问题上还大谈人民政权，而不谈由什么阶级领导，而这恰恰是决定性的。他们歪曲毛泽东关于无产阶级领导下的人民民主专政的论点。”
    文章指出：“修正主义不是一国的现象，而是国际现象，是社会历史现象。是渗入工人运动的资产阶级观念。”文章指出，产生修正主义的“国内根源是资产阶级的影响，国外根源是帝国主义。”
    文章最后说，现在，“世界上正展开着一场反对那些极力歪曲和修改马克思列宁主义基本原则的人的不屈不挠的斗争，历史已事先注定这些人必将灭亡。”
