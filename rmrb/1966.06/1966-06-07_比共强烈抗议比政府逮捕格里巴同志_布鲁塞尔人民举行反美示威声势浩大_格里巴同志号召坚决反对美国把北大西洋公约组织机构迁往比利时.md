    Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, June 6th. The Political Bureau of the Belgian Communist Party issued a communiqué on the 5th, strongly condemning the Belgian government, which caters to the wishes of the United States, for suppressing the Belgian people's demonstrations against the American plot to move NATO institutions from Paris to Brussels. The communiqué strongly protested the police authorities' arrest of Comrade Grippa, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, and others, and expressed the Belgian Communist Party's determination to fight to the end against the aggressive policies of the United States.

    The communiqué stated: On June 5th, on the eve of the NATO Ministerial Council meeting, more than 1,500 Belgians held a massive and determined demonstration, issuing a resounding call from the vast majority of the Belgian people against the establishment of NATO institutions in Belgium.

    The communiqué said that the Belgian "capital is virtually under martial law, completely guarded by police and gendarmerie forces. Hundreds of police and gendarmerie, as well as armored vehicles of the police force, heavily guarded the U.S. Embassy. No demonstrations are allowed around the U.S. Embassy, which is responsible for conveying Johnson's orders to the 'Belgian' government, disregarding the most basic rights stipulated in the constitution. This shows that (U.S. Secretary of State) Rusk, protected by hundreds of mercenaries ordered to isolate the access to the U.S. Embassy, is actually a prisoner of the citizens of Brussels surrounding him.

      "Before the start of the demonstration, Baron Alla and Briesch of the Belgian 'Action for Peace and Independence of Peoples,' as well as Arnold Horvart, member of the Political Bureau of the Belgian Communist Party and editor of the weekly *People's Voice*, delivered speeches, powerfully expressing the demonstrators' determination to truly engage in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, against NATO as the war machine of U.S. imperialism, against the establishment of foreign bases on Belgian soil, especially against the establishment of atomic bases, against new occupiers, and against the traitorous government that sells Belgium's independence to the American Yankees—the successors of Hitler.

      "In the aforementioned speeches, the Khrushchevites' proposal to conclude a so-called 'European security' treaty was exposed, a proposal that is the concretization of the policy of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world in a kind of military alliance.

    "This long demonstration marched along the boulevards of the capital, receiving encouragement, sympathy, and applause from the general public on the sidewalks in various forms.

    "Many placards and banners bore prominent slogans stating the aims of the demonstration: 'NATO Get Out!' 'Yankees Go Home!' 'Remove Foreign Bases from This Country!' 'National Independence!' 'Down with U.S. Imperialism!' 'No NATO Headquarters in Belgium!' 'Let Us Withdraw from NATO!' 'Expel NATO!'. The demonstrators shouted these slogans, and they also shouted: 'Johnson is a Murderer!' 'Yankees are Nazis!' 'We Want Vietnam, Not Yankees!' 'We Want Congo, Not Yankees!'"

    The communiqué said that subsequently, thousands of people gathered at the Rogier Square for a rally. Speakers at the rally successively emphasized that this demonstration was an extremely important first step for the Belgian people to take further actions, and that the fighters for peace and the independence of peoples, especially the fighters for Belgian independence, were determined to carry this action to final victory. Young people sang anti-imperialist songs and burned an effigy of Johnson, protesting the aggression of U.S. imperialism.

    The communiqué said, "At this time, when the demonstrators were preparing to disperse in an orderly manner, the police of Saint-Josse carried out brutal suppression. Police wielding batons charged at the demonstrators, especially women, injuring many, including Horvart, who was hospitalized due to injuries. This deliberate act of violence aroused the hatred of the demonstrators, who angrily shouted: 'Gestapo, Gestapo!' 'Fascists will never succeed!', 'Murderers!', 'Yankees Go Home!', 'Expel NATO!', while the public gathered on the sidewalks angrily denounced the police brutality."

    The communiqué said: "After the demonstrators were dispersed by the police, they surged onto the streets of Brussels in batches, continuing to powerfully shout: 'Withdraw from NATO!' 'Yankees Go Home!' Short and forceful demonstrations took place on the Grand Place until nearly 7 p.m. Dozens of Brussels police, armed with batons, rushed to the Grand Place again, carrying out the orders of the Yankees in Brussels. However, this could not prevent demonstrations from resuming in other parts of the capital. The Brussels police then carried out arbitrary and brutal arrests. Comrade Ja. Grippa, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, has now been arrested. Also arrested were: Michel Grandorge, member of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party and National Secretary of the Communist Youth Movement, Jeanne Vervoot, leader of the Youth Action Committee, and François Platte, former commander of the armed guerrillas, as well as many other young demonstrators."

    The communiqué said, "This brutal arrest and suppression by the police is a sign of the increasingly fascist nature of the traitorous government, in order to forcibly implement its anti-people policies." The communiqué said, "But, just as in Alabama, Saigon, Leopoldville, and everywhere the masses are shouting for independence, the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices and mercenaries cannot suppress the voice of the people."

    The communiqué concluded, "In the days to come, the increasingly powerful Belgian people are determined to demand the restoration of national independence and the expulsion of this war machine of U.S. imperialism used against the peoples of the world—NATO. No force can stop the victory of the just cause of the peoples of the world!"

    Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, June 5th. The latest issue of the Belgian Communist Party's organ, the weekly *People's Voice*, published an editorial written by Grippa, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, calling on the Belgian people to oppose the American plot to move NATO institutions from Paris to Brussels. The editorial also condemned modern revisionists for intensifying their cooperation with U.S. imperialism to oppose the peoples of all countries.

    The editorial, titled "Expel NATO! National Independence!", stated, "NATO being in Belgium is a foreign military occupation of Belgium." "It is the American army that is aggressing against the peoples of all countries from Santo Domingo to the China Sea. It is proving with iron and fire that U.S. imperialism has inherited Hitler's mantle, committing crimes more numerous and terrible than Hitler's. It is this American army that is engaged in looting, raping, torturing, using poison gas, arson, and massacring, as well as barbarically bombing schools, hospitals, cities, and villages in South Vietnam."

    The editorial also pointed out that NATO being in Belgium means further incorporating Belgium into the U.S. imperialists' global strategy to attempt to dominate the world, and it is a military demonstration of the American colonization of Belgium, and it is a fascistization of the Belgian government. This is the inevitable result of the betrayal of the country by the ruling class of financial capital, successive governments, the Belgian Socialist Party and its Khrushchevite followers, the Catholic Social Party, and the Belgian Liberal Progressive Party.

    The editorial pointed out that the Khrushchev revisionists are cooperating with the United States, "they hope to 'reform' and 'renovate' it by expanding and reorganizing NATO around the Washington-Moscow axis." The editorial emphasized that the so-called "European security" treaty is actually a "plan to further organize U.S.-Soviet cooperation in implementing long-term military coordination in order to dominate the world and oppose the peoples of all countries." The editorial said, "In fact, between NATO, the tool of U.S. imperialism (the main force of aggression and war in the world), and the Warsaw Pact, the tool by which Soviet revisionists are promoting their policies today, who will this treaty be directed against? Asking this question also answers it: against the peoples of all countries, against the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and also against the peoples of European countries."

    The editorial pointed out, however, that NATO is in a state of comprehensive crisis. The editorial said, "U.S. imperialism has suffered successive defeats. The defeats inflicted on it by the heroic Vietnamese people have promoted its great defeats worldwide. The nature of U.S. imperialism impels it to increasingly expand the scope of its aggression against the peoples of all countries, and therefore it is rapidly moving towards its final defeat. U.S. imperialism continues to fanatically implement its policy of dominating the world, and its demands, control, and greed are also making its allies, servants, and satellites increasingly bankrupt... The imperialist jackals are biting each other. Discord prevails in the imperialist camp, and the wind of defeat is blowing. U.S. imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated." The editorial pointed out that therefore, the current situation is very favorable for opposing the policies of the United States and its servants.

### 比共强烈抗议比政府逮捕格里巴同志  布鲁塞尔人民举行反美示威声势浩大  格里巴同志号召坚决反对美国把北大西洋公约组织机构迁往比利时

    比共强烈抗议比政府逮捕格里巴同志
    布鲁塞尔人民举行反美示威声势浩大
    格里巴同志号召坚决反对美国把北大西洋公约组织机构迁往比利时
    新华社布鲁塞尔六日电　比利时共产党政治局五日发表公报，强烈谴责奉承美国意旨的比利时政府镇压比利时人民反对美国阴谋把北大西洋公约组织机构从巴黎迁到布鲁塞尔的示威。公报强烈抗议警察当局逮捕比利时共产党中央委员会书记格里巴等人，并且表示比利时共产党决心为反对美国的侵略政策斗争到底。
    公报说：六月五日，即北大西洋公约组织举行部长理事会会议的前夕，比利时一千五百多人举行了声势浩大和坚决的示威游行，发出了比利时绝大多数人民反对北大西洋公约组织机构设在比利时的响亮呼声。
    公报说，比利时“首都实际上处于戒严状态，完全由警察和宪兵部队分兵把守着。几百名警察和宪兵以及警察部队的装甲车层层警卫着美国大使馆。负责向‘比利时’政府传达约翰逊命令的美国大使馆的周围不准举行任何示威游行，无视宪法规定的最起码的权利。这表明，受到奉命隔绝通向美国大使馆的通道的几百名雇佣军保护的（美国国务卿）腊斯克，实际上成了包围他的布鲁塞尔市民的俘虏。
      “在示威游行开始之前，比利时‘争取和平与各国人民独立行动’的阿拉男爵和勃里肖以及比利时共产党政治局委员兼《人民之声》周刊编辑阿诺尔德·霍瓦尔特都发表了讲话，有力地表示了示威者用行动真正投入斗争的决心，反对美帝国主义，反对作为美帝国主义的战争机器的北大西洋公约组织，反对在比利时国土上设立外国基地，特别是反对设立原子基地，反对新的占领者，反对把比利时的独立出卖给美国佬——希特勒的继承者——的卖国政府。
      “在上述讲话中，赫鲁晓夫分子提出的缔结所谓‘欧洲安全’条约的建议遭到揭露，这项建议是美苏合作主宰世界的政策在一种军事联盟中的具体化。
    “这支长长的示威队伍在首都的林荫大道上行进，沿途受到人行道上的广大公众以各种形式表示的鼓励、同情和鼓掌欢迎。
    “许多标语牌和横幅上用醒目的大字表明了这次示威的目标：‘北大西洋公约组织滚出去！’‘美国佬滚出去！’‘撤除在这个国家的外国基地！’‘民族独立！’‘打倒美帝国主义！’‘不准北大西洋公约组织总部设在比利时！’‘让我们退出北大西洋公约组织！’‘赶走北大西洋公约组织！’。示威者高呼这些口号，他们还高呼：‘约翰逊是杀人犯！’‘美国佬是纳粹分子！’‘要越南，不要美国佬！’‘要刚果，不要美国佬！’。”
    公报说，接着，数以千计的人们聚集在罗吉埃广场举行集会。在会上发言的人先后强调指出，这个示威行动是比利时人民将再接再厉采取行动的极其重要的第一步，争取和平与各国人民独立的战士，特别是争取比利时独立的战士，决心要把这个行动进行到最后胜利。青年们高唱反帝歌曲，并烧毁了约翰逊的模拟象，表示抗议美帝国主义的侵略。
    公报说，“这时，当示威者准备井井有序地散开的时候，圣约瑟的警察就进行残暴的镇压。警察手执警棍冲向示威者，特别是妇女，打伤好多人，其中有霍瓦尔特，霍瓦尔特因受伤被送往医院。这种蓄意的暴行激起示威群众的痛恨，他们愤怒地高呼：‘盖世太保，盖世太保！’‘法西斯决不可能得逞！’，‘杀人犯！’，‘美国佬滚出去！’，‘把北大西洋公约组织赶出去！’，同时，聚集在人行道上的公众愤怒地大声斥责警察的暴行。”
    公报说：“示威者被警察驱散后，又一批一批地涌向布鲁塞尔的大街上，继续有力地高呼：‘退出北大西洋公约组织！’‘美国佬滚回去！’简短而有力的示威游行在大广场上进行到近十九点钟。好几十名布鲁塞尔警察手里拿着警棍又赶到大广场上，在布鲁塞尔执行美国佬的命令。然而这并不能阻止首都其它地方重新举行示威游行。布鲁塞尔警察于是就蛮横残暴地进行逮捕。比利时共产党中央委员会书记雅·格里巴目前已经遭到了逮捕。遭到逮捕的还有：比利时共产党中央委员会委员兼共产主义青年运动全国书记米歇尔·格兰多尔热，青年行动委员会领导人让娜·韦尔沃特和前武装游击队队长弗朗索瓦·普拉特以及许多其他示威青年。”
    公报说，“警察的这种残暴的逮捕和镇压是卖国政府越来越法西斯化的一个标志，以便强制推行它的反人民的政策”。公报说，“但是，就象在亚拉巴马、西贡、利奥波德维尔和在人民群众高呼要求独立的各地一样，美帝国主义者及其帮凶和雇佣军是压不倒人民的呼声的。”
    公报最后说，“在今后的日子里，日益强大的比利时人民决心要求重新取得国家独立、赶走美帝国主义用于反对世界各国人民的这一战争机器——北大西洋公约组织。任何势力都阻挡不了世界各国人民的正义事业的胜利！”
    新华社布鲁塞尔五日电　最近一期的比利时共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊刊载了比利时共产党中央委员会书记格里巴写的一篇社论，号召比利时人民反对美国把北大西洋公约组织机构从巴黎迁到布鲁塞尔的阴谋。社论还谴责现代修正主义者加紧同美帝国主义合作来反对各国人民。
    这篇以《驱逐北大西洋公约组织！民族独立！》为题的社论说，“北大西洋公约组织设在比利时，就是外国军事占领比利时。”“正是美国军队在从圣多明各到中国海的世界各地侵略各国人民，正是它用铁和火来证明，美帝国主义已继承了希特勒的衣钵，所犯罪行的次数和可怕程度比希特勒有过之无不及。正是这支美国军队在南越进行抢劫、奸淫、拷打、施放毒气、纵火、屠杀以及野蛮轰炸学校、医院、城市和乡村。”
    社论还指出，北大西洋公约组织设在比利时，就是把比利时进一步纳入美帝国主义千方百计企图统治世界的全球战略中，就是在军事上表明美国使比利时殖民化，就是使比利时政府法西斯化。这是财政资本统治阶层、历届政府、比利时社会党及其赫鲁晓夫附庸、天主教社会党和比利时自由进步党背叛国家的当然结果。
    社论指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在同美国搞合作，“他们希望以围绕华盛顿—莫斯科轴心扩大和整顿北大西洋公约组织的办法来把它‘改革’和‘革新’”。社论强调，所谓“欧洲安全”条约实际上是一个“在实行长期军事配合方面进一步组织美苏合作以统治世界和反对各国人民的计划。”社论说，“实际上，在北大西洋公约组织这个美帝国主义（世界上的主要侵略和战争力量）的工具同华沙条约这个苏联修正主义者今天推行政策的工具之间，这个公约的矛头将反对谁呢？提出这个问题也就得到了回答：反对各国人民，反对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民，也反对欧洲各国人民。”
    社论指出，然而，北大西洋公约组织已处在全面的危机中。社论说，“美帝国主义已连续遭到失败。英雄的越南人民使它遭到的失败，促进了它在世界范围的大失败。美帝国主义的本性促使它日益扩大它对各国人民的侵略范围，因此，它就迅速走向它的最后失败。美帝国主义狂热地继续执行它的统治世界的方针，它的要求、控制和贪婪，也把它的盟国、仆从和卫星弄得日益破产……帝国主义豺狼正在狼咬狼。帝国主义阵营中呈一片不和，刮起了失败之风。美帝国主义正在越来越孤立。”社论指出，因此，目前形势对于反对美国及其仆从的政策是大为有利的。
