    Based on the victory of the socialist education movement, Xujiayuan Brigade of Luowenzao Commune in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, learned from the People's Liberation Army (PLA), greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of its members and cadres.
    The basic experience of this brigade in learning from the PLA, emphasizing politics, is: learning from the PLA's loyalty to the Party and Mao Zedong Thought, treating Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives for all tasks, adhering to the "four firsts" like the PLA, focusing on living ideas, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of members; firmly grasping the cultivation of a leadership core, and establishing in cadres and members the thinking of not seeking fame or profit, but serving the revolution wholeheartedly.
    Learning from the PLA, Emphasizing Politics, and Using Politics to Command Everything
    The PLA is a model and example of emphasizing politics and creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. To learn from the PLA's experience of emphasizing politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works was a long-held desire of the masses of Xujiayuan.
    In 1964, the Party Central Committee issued the call to "Learn from the People's Liberation Army throughout the country." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xujiayuan Brigade were extremely excited and responded actively. However, at that time, the work of this brigade was still relatively backward, and the momentum of learning from the PLA was not great.
    In 1965, after the socialist education movement, the political consciousness of cadres and members of this brigade was greatly improved, and in April, the Party branch made a decision to learn from the People's Liberation Army.
    The process of learning from the PLA is a process of struggling against all kinds of non-proletarian ideas. After the decision to learn from the PLA was publicized and implemented among the cadres and the masses, some people expressed opposition. Their reasons were threefold: First, they believed that farmers did not need to learn from the PLA's experience, saying: "The PLA carries guns and fights battles, so they should emphasize politics and study Chairman Mao's works vigorously; we farmers till the land, so it's enough to produce more grain. We don't need to emphasize politics, nor do we need to study Chairman Mao's works." Second, they believed that the PLA's experience could not be learned, saying: "The PLA has organization and discipline, and they don't have to worry about anything while eating the government's rice, so anything they say is easy to do. We have a large family of wives and children, busy with eating and dressing, so how can we compare with them, how can we learn from them?" Third, they believed that the army is the army, and the locality is the locality, so the PLA's experience is not applicable to the locality.
    After discussion, the Party branch pointed out sharply: These problems are essentially using special conditions as an excuse, not emphasizing politics, and denying the universal significance of the PLA's experience. To solve these problems, it is necessary to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, use the revolutionary spirit, thoroughly destroy the local special arguments, and thoroughly destroy metaphysical viewpoints.
    The Party branch invited leaders of the PLA stationed in the area to give a report on "Why is it necessary to emphasize politics?" Then, it organized cadres and members to launch a great debate on whether farming should emphasize politics and whether to learn from the PLA. Through this debate, everyone deeply realized: It is very dangerous to bury oneself in production without emphasizing politics, without arming one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought, and without engaging in the ideological revolutionization of people.
    The Party branch also organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant works and the People's Daily editorials "The Whole Country Should Learn from the People's Liberation Army" and "Spread the 'Three-Eight Work Style' to the Whole Country," so that everyone realized: First, the PLA does a good job in emphasizing politics and studies Chairman Mao's works well, and the advanced experience it has created and summarized is the most abundant. If it is advanced experience, then it should be learned well; second, the human factor is primary. Whether or not one can learn from the PLA does not depend on the objective conditions, but on whether people have revolutionary ambition; as long as they have revolutionary ambition, they will surely be able to learn the PLA's good ideas, good experiences, good work style, good traditions, and good methods; third, the reason why they did not learn well from the PLA in the past was not that the PLA's experience was not applicable to the locality, but that they did not learn and use it well. From then on, learning from the PLA became a conscious requirement and conscious action of the masses.
    Learning from the PLA's Loyalty to the Party and Mao Zedong Thought, Treating Chairman Mao's Books as the Highest Directives, and Letting Mao Zedong Thought Take Root Among the Masses
    In the practice of leading members to learn from the PLA, the Party branch of Xujiayuan Brigade deeply realized: The reason why the PLA stands high and sees far, and can withstand any test in the revolutionary storm, is because it treats Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives for all tasks, and never forgets the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao at all times, in all matters, and in all places. To learn from the PLA, one must first learn from the PLA's red heart of loyalty to the Party and Mao Zedong Thought.
    If you forget the bitterness of class, you will not learn consciously. After Party Branch Secretary Xue Kui went to the PLA units to learn from their experience, he understood such a principle: Learning depends on consciousness; to solve the problem of consciousness, it is necessary to raise the class consciousness of the broad masses of members and learn with deep class feelings. They immediately launched a vigorous class education campaign among the masses. They invited old poor peasants, old Party members, and old cadres to recall the history of the village, the history of the commune, and the history of their families, and to speak out about the bitterness of class oppression, the bitterness of national oppression, and the bitterness of capitalist restoration.
    Class education is the key to enlightening class consciousness. Through class education, the members realized: Overthrowing the three great mountains depended on Chairman Mao's books, building socialism depends on Chairman Mao's books, and realizing communism still depends on Chairman Mao's books. What Chairman Mao says is what the poor and lower-middle peasants have in their hearts, and Chairman Mao's books are the books for the poor to make revolution and seek liberation. To make revolution, one must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.
    Militiaman Xi Zhicheng was deeply shaken by the stories of blood and tears told by his elders. He thought of how his father was tortured to death when he was three years old, his mother was forced to remarry, and how he and his grandmother lived a life of begging, and he cried with shame. He said: "I am a poor and lower-middle peasant, and not studying Chairman Mao's books is forgetting my roots." Xi Zhicheng quickly became an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works. Such examples are numerous.
    With deep class feelings, Chairman Mao's works have become an indispensable spiritual food for everyone in their daily lives. They said: "Every sentence in Chairman Mao's books is the truth, and every word is worth a thousand gold pieces. Reading Chairman Mao's books, you won't go the wrong way. Reading Chairman Mao's books, you have strength all over your body. Reading Chairman Mao's books, your revolutionary will surpasses Vajra." They study on the streets, in the fields, and in their homes. Mao Zedong Thought has taken deep root among the masses.
    Learning from the PLA, Creatively Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works to Transform Worldview, and Promoting the Ideological Revolutionization of Members
    Chairman Mao said: "The change in worldview is a fundamental change." In the process of learning from the PLA, the cadres and members of Xujiayuan Brigade deeply realized: To learn from the PLA's experience, the most important and fundamental thing is to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works like the PLA, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's worldview, and cultivate farmers into a new type of farmer with a heart for the motherland and a view of the world.
    In the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, they took detours. At first, many people only sought quick progress and studied many articles, but did not put in hard work on the word "use." They studied it again and again, but every time it was like water passing over the skin of the earth, not linking up with their own thoughts and work. Comrade Xue Kui took this problem and went to the army for experience a second time.
    After Comrade Xue Kui returned to the village, he immediately convened an enlarged meeting of the branch committee. Based on the experience of the army, they found three gaps: ① They did not use it on the fundamental issue of transforming the worldview like the PLA; ② They did not grasp the main problems and study and apply it creatively with problems in mind like the PLA; ③ They did not adhere to the learning method of being few but精 (精, jīng means refined, of high quality) like the PLA. They comprehensively analyzed and studied the problems existing in the brigade: The main thing was that the idea of farming for the revolution had not yet been established, and the position of "public" and "private" was not right. Some people regarded "work points" as "lifeblood." From these problems, everyone realized: Without eliminating private thoughts and establishing the idea of serving the public, the socialist cause would not prosper.
    The Party branch, with this problem in mind, organized members to study articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Get Organized!" and "Combat Liberalism." They combined the study of Chairman Mao's works with the study of heroic figures, with the study of the Party's policies and principles, with the study of major domestic and international current events, and with watching revolutionary movies. Through study, the broad masses of members received a lively, specific, and practical education in collectivism, patriotism, and internationalism. They understood that without collective prosperity, there would be no individual happiness; without the country, there would be no self; without the liberation of the class, there would be no individual liberation. They said with emotion: "We live in Xujiayuan, but we must see the whole of China and the whole world. We can't just care about our own little lives in the future."
    In this profound ideological transformation process, the most prominent change was in young member Xue Gang. Although Xue Gang came from a poor peasant family, his thinking was relatively backward and he was very particular about work points. The Party and Youth League branches helped him study Chairman Mao's works. The more he studied, the more he felt that his words and deeds were contrary to Chairman Mao's teachings. He examined himself and said: "The PLA thinks of the people and the revolution at all times, while I think of myself and work points at all times. Bethune, Zhang Side, Wang Jie, and Jiao Yulu can sacrifice themselves for the revolutionary cause, so what personal interests can't I sacrifice?" From then on, Xue Gang changed. During the drought, he got up early every day to carry ice for the collective. Seeing that the manure in the team had not been sent to the fields, he took advantage of his lunch break to carry it to the fields. When the team leader proposed to record work points for him, he said angrily: "Don't look at people with old eyes. I'm doing this to build socialism." Soon, Xue Gang was rated as a "Five-Good" member.
    People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power. When opening up a canal to divert water, they encountered a reclining bull stone weighing three thousand kilograms blocking the way. Twelve young people formed a shock team to overcome the difficulties, saying: "Even if it's Mount Tai, we'll move it away." They finally moved the big stone and opened up a channel five thousand meters long. Many facts made the Party branch deeply realize: Mao Zedong Thought armed the PLA, and they could win every battle and overcome every obstacle; Mao Zedong Thought armed the members, and they could transform the sky and transform the earth.
    Learning from the PLA, Adhering to the "Four Firsts," Focusing on Living Ideas, Commending Good People and Good Deeds, and Establishing New Morality and New Customs
    "Adhering to the 'Four Firsts' and grasping living ideas well" is an important experience of the PLA's political and ideological work. The Party branch of Xujiayuan Brigade used the PLA's experience to carry out lively and active education activities among the masses.
    In the past, this brigade was not good at grasping living ideas. Last year, they invited a leading comrade of the PLA to the village and introduced the experience of grasping living ideas, so that all the cadres realized: To emphasize politics, it is necessary to grasp living ideas well, and use the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot the "target" of ideological problems in this brigade.
    Based on the PLA's experience in grasping living ideas, they, with Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, grasped the two ends: One end was to publicize the Party's various policies and principles to make them deeply rooted in the hearts of the people; the other end was to grasp the ideological dynamics of the members and solve the constantly emerging ideological and practical problems. In grasping the two ends, they also paid special attention to grasping the sprouts, grasping the timing, and grasping the opportunities. For example, among the fifty-four returned educated youth, a few were not at ease with agricultural production, thinking that after studying, it was useless and hopeless to till the land again. The Party branch seized this problem and organized them to study "The Orientation of the Youth Movement" and "Serve the People," and discussed special topics such as what is called promising and what is called the future. Through discussion, they realized that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, everything is revolution and everything has a future, and they expressed their determination to devote their lives to farming in the countryside and to making revolution for a lifetime. In the activity of learning from and catching up with Ping Shan, some people thought that Ping Shan was just "planting a few poplar trees" on the mountain and that there was nothing to learn. The Party branch seized this living idea and repeatedly educated the members by adopting the method of looking at oneself and comparing with others. The members' awareness was raised, and they examined themselves and said: "In the past few years, we have suffered losses here. We listened to other people's experiences but didn't believe them, we looked at them but didn't accept them, and we didn't do anything when we came back, and we tied our own hands and feet." From then on, the activity of learning from and catching up with Ping Shan was carried out in depth. Recently, they heard on the radio and read in the newspapers about the exposure of the "Three-Family Village's" anti-Party and anti-socialist counter-revolutionary black words, and organized members to rise up to refute them and resolutely defend the Party, defend socialism, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.
    The Party branch has always insisted on grasping regular political education and daily ideological work like the PLA. The main thing is to commend good people and good deeds and mobilize all positive factors. They realized that commending good people and good deeds is to support the young shoots of communism. Every time they commend, they instill the ideas of socialism, collectivism, and patriotism into the hearts of the members; at the same time, they also remove some of the dust of capitalism and individualism.
    The Party branch often used the PLA's noble qualities to educate members to establish new customs. Last winter, a member lost his cotton-padded jacket in the field. After a PLA comrade picked it up, he sent it back to the owner that night. The Party branch seized this incident and launched a discussion among the members, calling on everyone to learn from the PLA. Through continuous education, the PLA's noble virtues took root in the minds of the members.
    Learning from the PLA, Cultivating a Leadership Core, and Promoting Ideological Revolutionization. Not for Fame, Not for Profit, Serving the Revolution Wholeheartedly
    Over the past year, the Party branch of Xujiayuan Brigade deeply realized: To learn from the PLA's experience, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and the key is the ideological revolutionization of the leadership core.
    For a period of time, some cadres dealt with their work passively; some new cadres were hesitant to work, afraid of difficulties, afraid of offending people, and afraid of not completing their tasks. They said that being a cadre was troublesome, and it was better to be a member and save trouble. Through learning from the PLA and participating in the training of grassroots cadres in the county, the Party branch realized: To manage people, one must first manage oneself. To revolutionize the ideology of members, it is necessary to first revolutionize the ideology of the leadership core. Every Party member and cadre should put themselves in the position with an honest attitude, reveal their thoughts, and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their own thinking.
    Party Branch Secretary Xue Kui took the lead in starting with himself. He separately convened a branch committee meeting and a meeting of all cadres, and sincerely examined his own individualistic thoughts of fearing hardship and fatigue and being concerned about personal gains and losses. He asked Party members, Youth League members, and cadres to fire at their own individualism. He took the initiative to go deep into the masses, making self-criticism to the masses on the one hand and soliciting the opinions of the masses on the other.
    At this time, a member named Zhang Wanyun, because he had made some excessive suggestions to Xue Kui in the past, took the initiative to apologize to Comrade Xue Kui. Xue Kui immediately thought: The member apologized to the cadre, indicating that they had concerns about the cadre and were afraid of retaliation from the cadre. He explained to Zhang Wanyun: "What you did was completely right. My working methods in the past were simple, I didn't care enough about the masses, and I had many mistakes. The masses should criticize me. Chairman Mao said: 'We have the weapon of Marxism-Leninism of criticism and self-criticism. We can get rid of bad work styles and maintain good work styles.'"
    Comrade Xue Kui reported this matter to all members of the Party branch. He pointed out: There must be more than one person with Zhang Wanyun's thinking, and he hoped that everyone would pay attention to this situation. After democratic discussion, the branch made three resolutions: First, cadres must show their attitude to the masses and are not allowed to retaliate against the masses on any pretext; second, widely make friends with the masses and be the confidants of the masses; third, care about the suffering of the masses.
    Comrade Xue Kui set an example for everyone. As a result, everyone revealed their thoughts and laid out their problems, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fire at all selfish thoughts. Communist Party member and third production team leader Xiong Wei slackened off in his work because he made some mistakes and was criticized, and he repeatedly asked not to be the team leader. Some comrades in the Party branch also lost confidence in him. After Comrade Xue Kui returned from learning from the PLA for the third time, he organized all Party members and cadres to study "Rectify the Party's Style of Work" with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao said: "Anyone who makes mistakes, as long as he does not conceal his illness, does not stubbornly cling to his mistakes to the point of being incurable, but is honest, truly willing to be treated, and willing to correct them, we should welcome him, cure his problems, and turn him into a good comrade." Everyone was greatly inspired by studying this passage from Chairman Mao. Xiong Wei was very excited and immediately made a self-criticism, expressing his determination to resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, throw off his burdens, and correct his mistakes. After that, he took the initiative to change, and everyone helped him enthusiastically. Sure enough, he became a good Party member and a good cadre.
    Chairman Mao pointed out that whether a person is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary depends on whether he serves the people wholeheartedly. The Party branch took Chairman Mao's teachings as the highest directive and constantly educated cadres and cultivated and improved cadres. Deputy brigade leader Xu Shicheng was active and responsible in his work and took the lead in doing practical work. His shortcoming was that his work style was simple and crude, and he often glared and got angry. Once, when members gave him some suggestions, he flew into a rage: "I, Xu Shicheng, have a clear conscience towards the Party. I have not done anything to betray the Party or the people. If they are good, let them do it!" Following the experience introduced by the PLA, the Party branch organized everyone to study "Serve the People." Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our army is entirely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people." "As long as we persist in what is good for the interests of the people and correct what is wrong for the interests of the people, our army will surely prosper." Every word and sentence of Chairman Mao touched everyone's hearts. Many people said: "Glaring at the masses is the style of an overlord. People with this style cannot be said to serve the people 'completely' and 'thoroughly.'" "Shicheng is active and responsible in his work and takes the lead in doing practical work, which is an advantage and should continue to be carried forward; but he cannot stop the masses from criticizing his shortcomings because he has advantages, and he cannot make efforts to correct his shortcomings. This is not the attitude that our Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres should have." Chairman Mao's instructions and the help of comrades made Xu Shicheng realize his mistakes. He expressed his desire to be a servant of the masses, not an "official master" of the masses.
    The revolutionary spirit of the cadres, who did not care about personal gains and losses and were wholeheartedly for the revolution and wholeheartedly for the people, was a profound education for the broad masses of members and was the most powerful call. The masses praised the cadres happily, saying that "they stand tall and walk upright." They unanimously said: "Shake our hands and lift our legs. Wherever the cadres go, we will go."
    From Xu Shicheng's incident, the Party branch further realized that the reason why some cadres made mistakes in the past was that they did not study Chairman Mao's works enough, there was not enough criticism and self-criticism, and there was not enough contact with the masses. In response to this situation, the Party branch strengthened the learning system, the Party life system, and the system of contact with the masses. It required every Party member and cadre to resolutely achieve: not being special, not taking advantage of the collective, taking the lead in participating in labor, treating people with an equal attitude, consulting with the masses in case of trouble, and accepting the supervision of the masses.
    After a year of learning from the PLA, focusing on the ideological revolutionization of the leadership core, every Party member and cadre of Xujiayuan Brigade has initially established the thinking of not seeking fame or profit, not fearing hardship or death, serving the people wholeheartedly, and serving the revolution wholeheartedly.
    Over the past year, Xujiayuan Brigade has made remarkable achievements in learning from the PLA and emphasizing politics. The good ideas, good work style, good traditions, and good methods of the PLA have taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit here. In order to carry out the activity of learning from the PLA in depth and truly learn the valuable experience of the PLA, the Party branch recently organized members and cadres to fully summarize the experience of learning from the PLA over the past year with the viewpoint of dividing one into two, affirming achievements, identifying problems, and further strengthening leadership. They firmly believe that as long as they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance bravely along the road taken by the PLA, they will surely educate the broad masses of members into a team that is very proletarianized and very combative like the PLA.

    读了毛主席的书，革命意志赛金刚
    山西阳高县许家园大队大学解放军活学活用毛主席著作的根本经验
    山西阳高县罗文皂公社许家园大队，在社会主义教育运动取得胜利的基础上，大学解放军，大大地促进了社员的思想革命化，促进了干部思想革命化。
    这个大队大学解放军突出政治的基本经验是：学习解放军忠于党，忠于毛泽东思想，把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，象解放军那样坚持四个第一，大抓活思想，促进社员思想革命化；狠抓培养领导核心，在干部、社员中树立不为名、不为利、全心全意为革命的思想。
    学习解放军，突出政治，用政治统帅一切
    突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，解放军是典范，是榜样。把解放军突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的经验学到手，这是许家园群众老早就有的愿望。
    一九六四年，党中央发出“全国都要学习解放军”的号召。许家园大队的贫下中农无比兴奋，积极响应。但是，当时这个队的工作还比较落后，学习解放军的声势不大。
    一九六五年，这个大队经过社会主义教育运动，干部和社员的政治觉悟大大提高，四月间党支部作出了向解放军学习的决定。
    学习解放军的过程是与形形色色非无产阶级思想作斗争的过程。向解放军学习的决定在干部、群众中宣传贯彻以后，有些人表示反对。他们的理由有三：一，认为解放军的经验农民不需要学，他们说：“解放军是扛枪打仗的，应当突出政治，大学毛主席著作；咱农民是种田的，多打粮食就行了，用不着突出政治，也不需要学习毛主席著作。二，认为解放军的经验不能学，他们说：“解放军有组织，有纪律，吃官饭不操闲心，说啥也好办。咱们老婆孩子一大串，忙吃又忙穿，咋能和人家比，咋能向人家学。”三，认为军队是军队，地方是地方，解放军的经验地方用不上。
    党支部经过讨论，一针见血地指出：这些问题实质上是以条件特殊作借口，不要突出政治，否认解放军经验的普遍意义。要解决这些问题，必须以毛泽东思想为武器，用革命的精神，大破地方特殊的论调，大破形而上学观点。
    党支部邀请驻军首长作了“为什么要突出政治”的报告。接着组织干部、社员开展了一场种田要不要突出政治、要不要学习解放军的大辩论。通过这场辩论，大家深刻地认识到：不突出政治，不用毛泽东思想武装头脑，不搞人的思想革命化，埋头去抓生产，是很危险的。
    党支部还组织大家学习了毛主席的有关著作和人民日报的《全国都要学习解放军》、《把三八作风传播到全国去》两篇社论，使大家认识到：第一，解放军突出政治好，对毛主席著作学得好，创造和总结的先进经验最丰富。既是先进经验，就要好好的学习；第二，人的因素第一，能不能学习解放军，不在于客观条件如何，关键在于人有没有革命的雄心壮志；只要有了革命的雄心壮志，就一定能把解放军的好思想、好经验、好作风、好传统、好方法学到手；第三，过去学习解放军没学好，不是解放军的经验地方用不上，而是没有很好学、很好用。从此以后，向解放军学习就变成了群众的自觉要求和自觉行动。
    学习解放军忠于党、忠于毛泽东思想，把毛主席的书当作最高指示，让毛泽东思想在群众中扎根
    许家园大队党支部，在领导社员学习解放军的实践中，深刻地认识到：解放军所以站得高，看得远，在革命的风浪中能经受住任何考验，就是因为把毛主席的书当作一切工作的最高指示，时时、事事、处处不忘党和毛主席的教导。学习解放军，要首先学习解放军忠于党、忠于毛泽东思想的这颗红心。
    忘记了阶级苦，学习就不会自觉。党支部书记薛奎同志到驻军部队取经以后，懂得了这样一个道理：学习靠的是自觉；要解决自觉这个问题，必须提高广大社员的阶级觉悟，带着深厚的阶级感情去学。他们立即在群众中开展了大张旗鼓的阶级教育活动。请老贫农、老党员、老干部回忆村史、社史、家史，大诉阶级压迫苦、民族压迫苦、资本主义复辟苦。
    阶级教育，是启发阶级觉悟的钥匙。通过阶级教育，社员们认识到：推翻三座大山靠的是毛主席的书，建设社会主义靠的是毛主席的书，实现共产主义还要靠毛主席的书。毛主席说的话是贫下中农心里话，毛主席的书是穷人闹革命求解放的书。要革命，就要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    民兵席志成，听了长辈们诉的血泪史，思想上发生了强烈的震动。他想到三岁时父亲被人家活活折磨死，母亲被逼改嫁，他和老奶奶讨饭苦度日月的生活，惭愧地失声痛哭。他说：“我是贫下中农，不念毛主席的书，就是忘本。”席志成很快变成一个学习毛主席著作的积极分子。这样的事例不胜枚举。
    有了深厚的阶级感情，毛主席著作就成了每个人日常生活中不可缺少的精神食粮。他们说：“毛主席的书句句是真理，字字值千金。读了毛主席的书，路子走不错。读了毛主席的书，浑身有力量。读了毛主席的书，革命意志赛金刚。”他们学在街头，学在地头，学在炕头。毛泽东思想在群众中深深地扎下了根。
    学习解放军，要活学活用毛主席著作改造世界观，促进社员思想革命化
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。许家园大队干部社员在学习解放军过程中，切身体会到：要把解放军经验学到手，最主要、最根本的是象解放军那样活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想去改造人们的世界观，把农民培养成具有胸怀祖国，放眼世界的新型农民。
    在学习毛主席著作运动中，他们走过弯路。起初，不少人只求进度快，学的篇数多，不求在“用”字上狠下功夫。学了一遍又一遍，遍遍都是水过地皮湿，与自己的思想、工作挂不上钩。薛奎同志带着这个问题，二次到部队取经。
    薛奎同志返村后，连夜召开支部委员扩大会议。他们根据部队的经验，找出三条差距：①没有象解放军那样用在改造世界观这个根本问题上；②没有象解放军那样抓住主要问题，带着问题活学活用；③没有象解放军那样坚持少而精的学习方法。他们全面分析研究了大队存在的问题：主要是为革命种田的思想还没有确立，“公”与“私”的位置没有摆对。一些人把“工分”看成“命根”。从这些问题，大家认识到：不破除私人杂念，不树立为公的思想，社会主义事业就兴旺不起来。
    党支部带着这个问题组织社员学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《放下包袱，开动机器》和《反对自由主义》等文章。并把学习毛主席著作与学习英雄人物相结合，与学习党的方针政策相结合，与学习国内外重大时事相结合，与看革命的电影相结合。通过学习，广大社员受到一次活的、具体的、实际的集体主义、爱国主义、国际主义的教育。他们懂得了没有集体的富裕，就没有个人的幸福；没有国家，就没有自己；没有阶级的解放，就没有个人的解放的道理。他们感慨地说：“我们身居许家园，眼要看到全中国、全世界，以后可不能只顾自己的小日子。”
    在这场深刻的思想改造过程中，变化最突出的是青年社员薛刚。薛刚虽然出身贫农家庭，可是思想比较落后，对工分斤斤计较。党、团支部帮助他学习了毛主席的著作。他越学越觉得自己的言行与毛主席的教导相反。他检查说：“解放军时时刻刻想的是人民，想的是革命，而我时时刻刻想的是自己，想的是工分。白求恩、张思德、王杰、焦裕禄能为革命事业牺牲自己，我还有什么个人利益不能牺牲的呢？”从此，薛刚变了，抗旱中他每天早起给集体背冰，他见队里的粪没有送到地里，利用中午休息时间往地里担。队长提出给他记工分，他还生气地说：“你们不要拿老眼光看人啦，我这为的是建设社会主义。”不久，薛刚被评为五好社员。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力。在开渠引水中，遇到三千斤重的一块卧牛石挡了道，十二个青年组成包打难关的突击队，说：“就是一座泰山也要把它搬走。”他们终于搬走了大石头，开通了五千米长的一条渠道。许许多多事实使党支部深刻地认识到：毛泽东思想武装了解放军，他们就能战无不胜，攻无不克；毛泽东思想武装了社员，他们就能斗天天变，斗地地变。
    学习解放军，坚持四个第一，大抓活思想，表扬好人好事，树立新道德、新风尚
    “坚持四个第一，抓好活思想”是解放军政治思想工作的一条重要经验。许家园大队党支部运用解放军的这条经验，对群众开展了生动活泼的教育活动。
    过去这个大队，不善于抓活思想。去年他们把解放军的一位领导同志请进村，介绍了抓活思想的经验，使全体干部认识到：要突出政治就要抓好活思想，就要用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射本大队思想之“的”。
    他们根据解放军抓活思想的经验，以毛泽东思想为指针，大抓两头：一头是抓宣传党的各项方针、政策，使之深入人心；另一头是抓社员的思想动态，解决不断出现的思想问题和现实问题。在抓两头中，还特别注意了抓苗头、抓火候、抓时机。如返乡的五十四名知识青年中，有少数人不安心农业生产，认为念了书，再种地，没出息，没前途。党支部抓住这个问题，组织他们学习了《青年运动的方向》和《为人民服务》，并讨论了啥叫有出息、啥叫前途等专题。通过讨论，他们认识到，在党和毛主席的领导下，哪儿都是革命，哪儿都有前途，表示立志在农村种一辈子田，干一辈子革命。在学赶平山的活动中，有的人认为平山只不过是在山头上“栽活了几棵白杨树”，没什么学头。党支部又抓住这一活思想，采取看看自己，比比人家的方法，对社员反复进行教育。社员们觉悟提高了，检查说：“几年来咱吃亏就吃在这里，对人家的经验听了不信，看了不服，回来不干，自己把自己的手脚捆住了。”从此，学赶平山的活动深入地开展起来了。最近他们从广播中听到、在报纸上看到揭露“三家村”反党、反社会主义的反革命黑话，组织社员奋起反驳，坚决保卫党、保卫社会主义、保卫毛泽东思想。
    党支部一直象解放军那样，坚持了抓经常性的政治教育和日常的思想工作。主要是表扬好人好事，调动一切积极因素。他们认识到：表扬好人好事就是扶持共产主义的幼芽。每表扬一次，就给社员的心里灌输了社会主义、集体主义、爱国主义的思想；同时也就去掉了一些资本主义、个人主义的灰尘。
    党支部经常用解放军的高贵品质来教育社员树立新风尚。去年冬季，有个社员把棉袄丢在地里，一位解放军同志拾到以后，当天晚上就送到失主手里。党支部抓住这件事，在社员中开展讨论，号召大家向解放军学习。通过不断的教育，解放军的高贵品德，在社员的头脑中扎下了根。
    学习解放军，培养领导核心，促进思想革命化。不为名，不为利，全心全意为革命
    一年来，许家园大队党支部深刻地体会到：要把解放军经验学到手，高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，领导核心思想革命化是关键。
    有一个时期，有的干部工作消极应付；有些新干部工作束手束脚，害怕困难，害怕得罪人，害怕完不成任务。他们说，当干部麻烦，不如当社员省心。通过学习解放军和参加县里基层干部训练，党支部认识到：管人先管己。要社员思想革命化，必须首先使领导核心思想革命化。每个党员干部都应当以老老实实的态度，把自己摆进去，把思想亮出来，用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想。
    党支部书记薛奎同志，首先从自己开刀。他分别召开了支委会、全体干部会，诚恳检查了自己怕苦怕累、患得患失的个人主义思想。他要求党员、团员、干部向自己的个人主义开火。他主动深入群众，一面对群众作检查，一面征求群众的意见。
    正在这个时候，有个叫张万云的社员，因过去给薛奎提的意见有些过火，主动找薛奎同志道歉。薛奎当即想到：社员找干部道歉，说明对干部有顾虑，怕干部打击报复。他向张万云解释说：“你做的完全对。我过去工作方法简单，关心群众不够，又有不少错误，群众应该批评。毛主席说：‘我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风’。” 
    薛奎同志把这件事向党支部全体委员作了汇报。他提出：有张万云这种思想的决非一人，希望大家注意这个情况。经过民主讨论，支部作出了三条决议：第一，干部必须向群众表明态度，不准以任何借口打击报复群众；第二，广泛同群众交朋友，做群众的知心人；第三，要关心群众疾苦。
    薛奎同志为大家树立了榜样。于是人人亮思想，摆问题，以毛泽东思想为武器，向一切私心杂念开火。共产党员、第三生产队长熊维，因犯了一些错误受了批评，工作松劲，多次要求不作队长。党支部有些同志也对他失去了信心。薛奎同志第三次从解放军取经回来以后，带着这个问题，组织全体党员、干部学习《整顿党的作风》。毛主席说：“任何犯错误的人，只要他不讳疾忌医，不固执错误，以至于达到不可救药的地步，而是老老实实，真正愿意医治，愿意改正，我们就要欢迎他，把他的毛病治好，使他变为一个好同志。”学习了毛主席的这段话，大家大受启发。熊维非常激动，当即作了检查，表示要坚决听毛主席的话，甩掉包袱，改正错误。此后，他主动改，大家热情帮，果然变成了一个好党员、好干部。
    毛主席指出，一个人是真革命还是假革命，要看是不是全心全意为人民服务。党支部以毛主席的教导为最高指示，不断教育干部，培养提高干部。副大队长许世成工作积极负责，带头实干，缺点是工作作风简单粗暴，常常吹胡子瞪眼睛。有一次，社员给他提了一些意见，他就大发雷霆：“我许世成对党问心无愧，我没有办对不起党、对不起人民的事，他们好，让他们干吧！”党支部照着解放军介绍的经验，组织大家学习《为人民服务》。毛主席指出：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”毛主席说的句句字字打动每个人的心。不少人说：“对群众吹胡子瞪眼睛是老爷式的作风，有这种作风的人，就谈不上‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民服务。”“世成工作积极负责，带头实干是优点，应该继续发扬；可不能因为有了优点就不让群众批评自己的缺点，不努力改正缺点，这不是我们共产党员、革命干部应有的态度。”毛主席的指示和同志的帮助，使许世成认识了错误。他表示要做群众的勤务员，不做群众的“官老爷”。
    干部们这样不计较个人得失，一心为革命、一心为人民的革命精神，对广大社员是一个深刻的教育，是一种最有力量的号召。群众高兴地称赞干部“腰杆挺得硬，脚步走得正”。一致表示：甩起手，抬起腿，干部咋走咱咋走。
    从许世成这件事，党支部进一步认识到：过去有的干部所以犯错误，原因就是学习毛主席著作不够，批评与自我批评不够，联系群众不够。针对这种情况，党支部加强了学习制度、党的生活制度、联系群众制度。要求每个党员、干部坚决做到：不特殊化，不占集体便宜，带头参加劳动，以平等态度待人，遇事同群众商量，接受群众监督。
    经过一年来的学习解放军，大抓领导核心思想革命化，许家园大队每个党员、干部初步树立了不为名、不为利、不怕苦、不怕死、全心全意为人民、全心全意为革命的思想。
    一年来，许家园大队大学解放军，突出政治，成绩是显著的。解放军的好思想、好作风、好传统、好方法已经和正在这里扎根，开花，结果。为了把学习解放军活动深入地开展起来，把解放军的宝贵经验真正学到手，党支部最近组织社员、干部以一分为二的观点，全面总结了一年来学习解放军的经验，肯定成绩，找出问题，进一步加强了领导。他们深信：只要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着解放军所走的道路奋勇前进，一定会把广大社员教育成为象解放军那样非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的队伍。
