    巴勒斯坦人民用毛泽东思想进行反帝斗争
    新华社上海六日电　巴勒斯坦举重队队长、巴勒斯坦举重协会主席阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·沙瓦离开上海回国前对新华社记者说：“毛主席是一位伟大的天才的领袖，他把中国从黑暗带向光明。”他还说，世界人民在反帝斗争中是互相支持的，一切反帝的人民也会掌握毛泽东思想。
    沙瓦说：“巴勒斯坦人民正在用毛泽东思想进行反帝斗争。”他说：“我衷心地向毛主席致以崇高的敬意，我们巴勒斯坦人民向毛主席致以崇高的敬意，希望毛泽东思想在全世界得到广泛的传播”。
    这个举重队应邀来中国参加新兴力量举重邀请赛后，在北京、上海、杭州进行了参观访问。沙瓦在向记者畅谈访华观感时说：“中国人民是战斗的人民，是善于斗争的人民，因为他们有毛泽东思想”。
    他说：“毛主席缔造了伟大的中国，他把中国从黑暗带向了光明，毛主席是一位伟大的天才的领袖，今天中国人民正按照毛主席的指示，全心全意地建设自己的国家”。他认为，无论在工厂、商店还是在农村，中国人民正在忘我地努力工作，不仅是为了自己的国家，而且是为了世界其他各国人民。沙瓦高度赞扬了中国运动员高尚的体育道德和中国人民的道德风貌。他说，中国运动员的体育道德是他生平没有看到过的；中国人民的道德风貌也是很多国家所没有的，这使他感到骄傲。
    沙瓦还谴责了美帝国主义。他说：“美帝国主义是世界人民的头号敌人，也是美国人民的头号敌人。美帝国主义完蛋的时候，就是世界各国人民获得解放的时候。”
