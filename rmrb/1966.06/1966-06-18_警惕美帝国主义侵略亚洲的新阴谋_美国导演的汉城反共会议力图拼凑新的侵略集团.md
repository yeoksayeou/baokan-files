    Be Vigilant Against the New Conspiracy of U.S. Imperialism to Invade Asia
    The Anti-Communist Conference in Seoul, Directed by the United States, Seeks to Piece Together a New Aggression Bloc
    Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Seoul Dispatch: The farce of the "Ministerial Conference" of anti-communist countries and puppet groups in the Asian and Pacific region, directed by the United States, concluded in Seoul on the 16th.
    The conference issued a joint communique, emphasizing the need to strengthen cooperation against communism and decided to establish a "Standing Committee" in Bangkok. In this way, U.S. imperialism has further gathered and controlled the anti-communist countries and puppet groups in the region, and has taken a step towards establishing an "Asian Anti-Communist League" with Japan as its core, implementing the policy of "containing China."
    The joint communique repeatedly touted "strengthening cooperation and unity among free countries in the Asian and Pacific region" against so-called "any communist aggression or infiltration from outside." The communique announced that the second so-called "Ministerial Conference of the Asian and Pacific Council" will be held in Thailand next year, and it wants to bring more so-called "free countries" in this region into the water, "encouraging" them to participate in future "consultations."
    When discussing the Vietnam issue, the communique completely parrots the tone and language of the U.S. aggressors, reversing black and white to describe the U.S. aggression against Vietnam as preventing "external aggression and subversion," and openly cooperates with the U.S.'s two-pronged strategy of intensifying the war of aggression and promoting "peace talks," supporting the South Vietnamese puppet group on the one hand, and touting a "peaceful solution" to the Vietnam issue on the other.
    The communique also strongly supports some illegal resolutions of the United Nations on the Korean issue, clamoring for the establishment of a so-called "unified, independent, and democratic Korea" based on these resolutions, which is to extend U.S. imperialism's colonial rule over South Korea to the entire Korean peninsula. The vast majority of participants in this conference are members of the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," the "ANZUS Security Treaty," or the "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" that has already been formed in practice.

### 警惕美帝国主义侵略亚洲的新阴谋  美国导演的汉城反共会议力图拼凑新的侵略集团

    警惕美帝国主义侵略亚洲的新阴谋
    美国导演的汉城反共会议力图拼凑新的侵略集团
    新华社十七日讯　汉城消息：由美国导演的亚洲和太平洋地区反共国家和傀儡集团“部长会议”丑剧，十六日在汉城收场。
    会议发表了一个联合公报，强调要加强合作反共，并且决定在曼谷成立一个“常务委员会”。这样，美帝国主义就把这个地区的反共国家和傀儡集团进一步纠集和控制起来，朝着建立一个以日本为核心、执行“遏制中国”政策的“亚洲反共联盟”的方向，跨进了一步。
    联合公报一再鼓吹“亚洲和太平洋地区自由国家加强合作和团结”，反对所谓“来自外部的任何共产党的侵略或渗透”。公报宣布明年将在泰国举行第二次所谓“亚洲和太平洋理事会的部长会议”，并且想在这个地区拉更多的所谓“自由国家”下海，“鼓励”它们参加未来的“磋商”。
    公报在谈到越南问题时，完全套用美国侵略者的腔调和语言，颠倒黑白地把美国对越南的侵略说成是防止“外部侵略和颠覆”，并且公然配合美国的加强侵略战争和推行“和谈”阴谋的两手策略，一面对南越傀儡集团表示支持，同时又鼓吹什么“和平解决”越南问题。
    公报还大力支持联合国关于朝鲜问题的一些非法决议，叫嚷要根据这些决议来建立一个所谓“统一的、独立的和民主的朝鲜”，也就是要把美帝国主义对南朝鲜的殖民统治推广到整个朝鲜。参加这次会议的绝大多数是“东南亚条约组织”、“美澳新安全公约”或实际上已经形成的“东北亚军事联盟”的成员。
