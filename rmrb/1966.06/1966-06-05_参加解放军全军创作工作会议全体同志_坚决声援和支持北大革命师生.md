    To Comrades Nie Yuanzi, Song Yixiu, Xia Jianzhi, Yang Keming, Zhao Zhengyi, Gao Yunpeng, Li Xingchen, and revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University:
    The 268 comrades who have come to the capital from all over the country to attend the Chinese People's Liberation Army's National Creative Work Conference extend to you our lofty revolutionary greetings!
    The Revolutionary "Monkey King" Raises Havoc in the Bourgeois "Heavenly Palace"
    The big-character poster by Comrade Nie Yuanzi and six other comrades, "What Exactly Are Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun Doing in the Cultural Revolution?" is a thunderclap in the Socialist Cultural Revolution at Peking University, a spiritual cannonball against the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang! You have resolutely implemented the supreme instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, discerning with keen eyes another trick of the "Three-Family Village" black gang; with dauntless revolutionary spirit, you launched a courageous offensive against the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line positions. You are revolutionary "Monkey Kings," daring to raise havoc in the bourgeois "Heavenly Palace"! All comrades attending the National Creative Work Conference cheer for another victory of the proletarian revolutionaries! We cheer "It's Fine!"
    At the same time, we angrily denounce the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Song Shuo, Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and others! This gang of clownish figures from the "Three-Family Village" black gang, attempting to stop the surging torrent of the Socialist Cultural Revolution, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames that have become a prairie fire, refusing to surrender and stubbornly resisting, fully proves that they are the most loyal running dogs of the bourgeoisie, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, the echoers of the Khrushchev revisionist clique and American imperialism, and the deadly enemies of the revolutionary people of China and the revolutionary people of the world!
    The Socialist Cultural Revolution is a Life-or-Death Struggle for Power
    Dear revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University: The Socialist Cultural Revolution under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao is a battle between the antagonistic world views of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a great revolution that touches people's souls, and a life-or-death struggle for power between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie! Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries are not reconciled to their defeat, and they will make a final struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disturbance in various ways, and they will attempt to restore [their power] in China every day and every hour." All the reactionary propaganda of the bourgeoisie in the ideological field is a prelude to this restoration dream. They wield pens to seize the guns and seals of the proletariat, in order to throw the worker-peasant-soldier masses into hell one day! The pens in their hands are bloodless knives and spears, weapons for rebellion!
    This is a matter of paramount importance concerning the future of our country's revolution, and it is also a matter of paramount importance concerning the world revolution!
    In this critical period, every revolutionary Chinese youth faces a historical test. Failure to resolutely open fire on the counter-revolutionary black gang inevitably means surrendering to the counter-revolutionary black gang! There is no room for the slightest ambiguity. There is no middle road. Comrade Nie Yuanzi and six other comrades have withstood this test, and their heroic revolutionary actions have set an example for us.
    The Remnants of the "Three-Family Village" Must Be Pursued to the End, and Neither "Generals" nor "Pawns" Should Be Allowed to Escape.
    Dear revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University: The revolution is deepening, and the struggle is becoming more intense. Although the enemy has fallen into the vast ocean of the worker-peasant-soldier Cultural Revolution, they are still frantically "strengthening" their reactionary "leadership" and "holding" their reactionary "posts." Their tricks will be more hidden, more sinister, and more cunning. Their favorite trick is to pretend to be revolutionaries and wave the red flag to oppose the red flag. But a fox is a fox after all, and its tail is hard to hide; a devil is a devil after all, and its ugly face cannot be covered up. As long as we are vigilant, we will not be fooled. We must not only overthrow those who are fighting bare-chested, but also ferret out those "mysterious figures" who are waving feather fans. They are afraid of big-character posters, but we will post big-character posters! They are afraid of holding mass rallies to denounce them, but we will hold mass rallies to denounce them! The remnants of these "Three-Family Village" and "Four-Family Village" members must be pursued to the end, and neither "generals" nor "pawns" should be allowed to escape justice.
    Dear revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University: All the comrades attending the National Creative Work Conference unanimously stated: We must learn from your firm proletarian stand, learn from your daring to think, dare to break through, and dare to make revolution, and resolutely support your revolutionary actions! We will resolutely stand with you, stand with the revolutionary people of all of China, and completely and thoroughly achieve:

    参加解放军全军创作工作会议全体同志
    坚决声援和支持北大革命师生
    聂元梓、宋一秀、夏剑豸、杨克明、赵正义、高云鹏、李醒尘及北京大学革命师生同志们：
    从祖国各地前来首都参加中国人民解放军全军创作工作会议的二百六十八名同志，向你们致以崇高的革命敬礼！
    革命的“孙悟空”大闹资产阶级的“天宫”
    聂元梓等七位同志贴出的《宋硕、陆平、彭珮云在文化革命中究竟干些什么？》的大字报，是社会主义文化大革命在北京大学响起的一声霹雳，是反击反党反社会主义黑帮的一颗精神炮弹！你们坚决执行了伟大领袖毛主席的最高指示，以锐利的眼光，识破了“三家村”黑帮的又一个诡计；以大无畏的革命气概，向反党反社会主义的黑线阵地展开了勇猛的进攻。你们是革命的“孙悟空”，敢于大闹资产阶级的“天宫”！参加全军创作工作会议的全体同志们，欢呼无产阶级革命派的又一个胜利！欢呼“好得很”！
    同时，我们愤怒声讨宋硕、陆平、彭珮云等人的反党反社会主义的罪行！这一伙“三家村”黑帮的跳梁小丑，妄想阻止社会主义文化大革命的滚滚洪流，妄想扑灭已成燎原之势的革命火焰，死不缴械，负隅顽抗，完全证明他们是资产阶级、地富反坏右最忠实走狗，是赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团和美帝国主义的应声虫，是全中国革命人民、全世界革命人民的死敌！
    社会主义文化大革命是你死我活的夺印之战
    亲爱的北京大学革命的师生同志们：在伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导下的社会主义文化大革命，是无产阶级和资产阶级的敌对世界观的搏斗，是触及人们灵魂深处的大革命，是无产阶级和资产阶级进行的一场你死我活的夺印之战！毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”资产阶级在意识形态领域里的一切反动宣传，正是这种复辟梦的前奏。他们舞文弄墨，是为了夺取无产阶级的枪杆子和印把子，是为了有一天把工农兵群众打入地狱！他们手里的笔杆子，是杀人不见血的刀枪，是造反的凶器！
    这是关系到我国革命前途的头等大事，也是关系到世界革命的头等大事！
    在这个非常时期里，每一个革命的中国青年，都面临着历史的考验，不坚决向反革命黑帮开火，就必然向反革命黑帮投降！容不得一丝一毫的含糊。中间道路是没有的。聂元梓等七位同志，经受住了这一场考验，他们英勇的革命行动，为我们做出了榜样。
    对“三家村”的穷寇们一定要追歼到底，不管是“将帅”还是“车马”一个也不准漏网
    亲爱的北京大学革命师生同志们：革命正在深入，斗争越趋激烈。敌人虽已陷入工农兵文化大革命的汪洋大海之中，但他们仍在疯狂地“加强”他们的反动“领导”，“坚守”他们的反动“岗位”。他们的花招，会更隐蔽，更阴险，更狡猾。他们善使的诡计是混充革命派，打着红旗反红旗。但狐狸究竟是狐狸，尾巴难藏；魔鬼究竟是魔鬼，鬼脸遮不住。只要我们提高警惕，就不会上当。我们既要打倒那些赤膊上阵的家伙，也要揪出那些摇羽毛扇的“神秘人物”，他们害怕大字报，我们偏要贴大字报！他们害怕开大会声讨，我们偏要开大会声讨！对这些“三家村”、“四家村”的穷寇们一定要追歼到底，不管是“将帅”，不管是“车马”，一个也不准逍遥法外，一个也不准漏网。
    亲爱的北京大学革命师生同志们：参加全军创作工作会议的全体同志们一致表示：要学习你们坚定的无产阶级立场，学习你们敢想敢闯敢革命的气概，坚决声援和支持你们的革命行动！坚决和你们站在一起，和全中国革命的人民站在一起，完全彻底地做到：
    “念念不忘阶级斗争，
    念念不忘无产阶级专政，
    念念不忘突出政治，
    念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。”
    保卫伟大的毛主席！保卫伟大的毛泽东思想！坚决把社会主义文化大革命进行到底！
    社会主义文化大革命万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
          出席中国人民解放军全军创作
                      工作会议全体同志
                      一九六六年六月二日
