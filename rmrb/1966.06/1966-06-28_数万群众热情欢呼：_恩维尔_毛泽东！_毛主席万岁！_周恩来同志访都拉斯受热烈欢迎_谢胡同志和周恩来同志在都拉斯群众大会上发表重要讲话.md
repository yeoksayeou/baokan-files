According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Tirana on the 26th, at 10 a.m. on the 26th, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, accompanied by Comrade Muçair Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Comrades Alush Charçani, Haki Toska, and Ramiz Alia of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, arrived in Durres, the largest port in Albania, by car to conduct a visit. He was warmly welcomed by more than 60,000 people from Durres City and the surrounding areas.

Today, the entire city of Durres was immersed in a joyous and friendly atmosphere. Comrade Riçard Marko, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania and First Secretary of the Durres District Committee, and Comrade Todi Jakova, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Durres District People's Assembly, welcomed the Chinese guests at the district boundary. Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai changed to an open-top car and entered the city. A group of young women presented flowers to Premier Zhou Enlai. Dense crowds of welcoming people lined both sides of the streets, waving colorful bouquets and the national flags of both countries, warmly welcoming the distinguished Chinese guests. The people shouted slogans such as "Enver—Mao Zedong," "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the unity and friendship between the peoples of Albania and China!" "Glory to the Vietnamese people who resolutely oppose American imperialism!" "Without thoroughly opposing revisionism, it is impossible to defeat imperialism!" and so on. Groups of cultural workers sang and danced, some singing the Chinese song "The East Is Red," and others performing dances such as "One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, One Hand Holding a Gun" and "Vietnam Will Surely Win." Teams of sports enthusiasts performed graceful gymnastics.

Premier Zhou Enlai repeatedly waved to the welcoming crowds.

Today, the entire city of Durres was adorned with flags. The national flags of both countries and red flags flew in the sky above the city. Tall buildings and streets were decorated with countless large banners. The banners read: "Long Live Comrade Mao Zedong!" "Long Live the Communist Party of China with Comrade Mao Zedong at its helm!" "Long Live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long Live the Party of Labor of Albania with Comrade Enver Hoxha at its helm!" "Long Live the indestructible fighting unity between the two parties of Albania and China!" Some banners were written in Chinese: "Welcome Premier Zhou Enlai!" "Welcome Chinese Guests!"

Along the road from Tirana to the city of Durres, workers from state farms and members of agricultural cooperatives along the route, hearing that the Chinese guests would pass by, rushed to welcome them enthusiastically. They wore national costumes, held flags and bouquets, and enthusiastically shouted "Long live the friendship between Albania and China!"

After resting briefly at the building of the Executive Committee of the Durres City People's Assembly, Premier Zhou Enlai and other Chinese guests went to participate in the Durres City mass rally held at Stalin Square. When Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Comrade Shehu and others, ascended the platform, the crowd erupted in thunderous cheers and applause that echoed across the Adriatic coast.

Today, the square was adorned with the national flags of both countries and red flags. Portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Comrade Hoxha hung high on tall buildings. Comrade Riçard Marko, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania and First Secretary of the Durres District Committee, first addressed the rally. He, on behalf of the people of Durres, extended a warm welcome to the great envoy from the fraternal country of China.

Subsequently, Comrade Shehu and Premier Zhou Enlai delivered important speeches at the rally (full text see this page). Their speeches repeatedly sparked stormy applause and cheers.

After the speeches, Premier Zhou Enlai and Comrade Shehu embraced warmly. Then, the Durres City Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania and the Executive Committee of the People's Assembly presented a scroll and other gifts to the Chinese guests. The scroll, written in gold, read: "The great friendship between the peoples and parties of Albania and China, built on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, will last forever." Premier Zhou Enlai presented a pair of porcelain vases with mountain construction scenes to the people of Durres.

The rally was conducted in an atmosphere filled with friendship and unity between Albania and China.

After the mass rally, Premier Zhou Enlai visited the Durres port. When Premier Zhou Enlai entered the port, the ships moored there blew their whistles in salute to the Chinese guest. Employees of the Sino-Albanian Shipping Company and sailors from China and Albania lined the route to warmly welcome Premier Zhou Enlai. On his way back to Tirana, Premier Zhou Enlai also visited the Sukses State Farm. Comrade Shehu personally introduced the agricultural tools used by the farm to Premier Zhou Enlai. Premier Zhou Enlai also listened to the farm director's report on production.

    大会是在充满中阿友谊和团结的气氛中进行的。
