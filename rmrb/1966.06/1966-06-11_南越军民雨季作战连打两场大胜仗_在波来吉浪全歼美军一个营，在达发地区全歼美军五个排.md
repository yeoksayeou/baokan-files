    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th – According to supplementary reports from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Gia Lai Province army and people of South Vietnam annihilated a large number of enemy troops in the offensive against enemy forces in the Bo Lai Gilang area from May 23rd to 30th, including the complete annihilation of one U.S. battalion and two puppet army companies.
    This annihilated battalion is the eleventh U.S. invading army battalion to be completely annihilated by the Liberation Army in South Vietnam since the beginning of this year, and is the first battalion of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division to be annihilated on the South Vietnamese battlefield. In this battle, the Gia Lai Province army and people also shot down six enemy planes and captured a large number of enemy weapons and military equipment.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th – The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Army Daily* published a commentary on the 9th regarding the victory of the South Vietnam Kon Tum Province Liberation Army in completely annihilating five U.S. platoons, two puppet army companies, and two puppet platoons in the Da Fa area in early June, pointing out that this is a new victory achieved by the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces after entering the rainy season operations.
    The commentary said that after suffering heavy defeats in Bo Lai Mei, Zhu Bang, Anxi, and other places, the American bandits strengthened their forces in the Western Highlands, consolidated their defense system, and carried out multiple "mopping-up" operations. The great victories achieved by the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces in the Bo Lai Gilang and Da Fa areas dealt unexpected and heavy blows to the American bandits and their running dogs, making the already passive American invaders even more passive.
    The commentary pointed out that Liberation Army soldiers continuously and fiercely attacked the enemy day and night, rain or shine, in the plains and mountains, and defeated the enemy. This once again shows that the army and people of South Vietnam have sufficient strength to eliminate the enemy, whether in the dry season or the rainy season. No matter how many troops and weapons the enemy has, and no matter how strong their fortifications are or how mobile their war tools are, they will be severely attacked by the Liberation Armed Forces. The commentary concluded that the great victory of the Liberation Armed Forces in Da Fa and the recent series of victories in attacking enemy airfields and strongholds have greatly promoted the brilliant victories achieved in the dry season, forcing the American bandits and their running dogs to sink deeper into the quagmire of passivity and embarrassment.

    南越军民雨季作战连打两场大胜仗
    在波来吉浪全歼美军一个营，在达发地区全歼美军五个排
    新华社河内九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，越南南方嘉莱省军民在五月二十三日至三十日对波来吉浪地区敌军发动的进攻中歼灭了大批敌人，其中全歼美军一个营和伪军两个连。
    这个被歼灭的营是今年年初以来美国侵略军在越南南方被解放军全歼的第十一个营，是美国第二十五步兵师在越南南方战场上第一个遭到歼灭的营。在这次战斗中，嘉莱省军民还击落敌机六架，并且缴获了敌人大量武器和军事装备。
    新华社河内十日电　越南《人民军队报》九日就越南南方昆嵩省解放军六月初在达发地区全歼美军五个排、伪军两个连和两个排的战绩发表评论指出，这是越南南方解放武装力量进入雨季作战后取得的一个新胜利。
    评论说，美国强盗在波来梅、朱邦、安溪等地遭到惨重失败之后，在西原地区增强了兵力，巩固了防御体系，并多次进行“扫荡”活动。南方解放武装力量在波来吉浪和达发地区取得的大捷，给美国强盗及其走狗以出其不意的沉重打击，使已经陷于被动的美国侵略者更加被动。
    评论指出，解放军战士在平原和山区，不分昼夜，不分天气好坏，连续猛烈地进攻敌人，战胜敌人。这一点再一次说明了越南南方军民不管是在旱季还是在雨季，都是有足够的力量消灭敌人。不论敌人有多少军队，多少武器，也不论他们的工事多么坚固，战争工具多么机动，都要遭到解放武装力量的痛击。评论最后说，解放武装力量的达发大捷和最近袭击敌人机场和据点等一连串的胜利，大大地发扬了在旱季中取得的辉煌胜利，迫使美国强盗及其走狗更深地陷入被动和困窘的泥坑中。
