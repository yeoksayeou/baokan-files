    Xinhua News Agency, Xingtai, 9th -- More than 10,000 cadres and commune members from the earthquake-stricken area of Xingtai held a rally in the Niujiaqiao Commune of the earthquake-stricken area on the 8th, warmly welcoming the Tibetan Autonomous Region慰问团 who traveled thousands of miles to send "Happiness Horses" to the people in the disaster area. The cadres and commune members participating in the welcome rally expressed the gratitude of the broad masses in the disaster area and the people of Hebei Province to their Tibetan brothers with great enthusiasm.
    After the earthquake disaster in Xingtai area, the emancipated farmers and herdsmen of the Tibetan Autonomous Region were extremely concerned. They selected 240 strong and gentle Tibetan horses to support the people in the disaster area in restoring and developing production, and also sent special personnel to escort the horses and express their sympathy.
    The慰问团 overcame various difficulties during the long journey of thousands of miles and personally delivered the horses to the earthquake-stricken area of Xingtai. This deep friendship deeply moved the people in the earthquake-stricken area. On June 8th, as soon as it dawned, the masses from the disaster area participating in the welcome meeting rushed to the venue from all directions. Niujiaqiao, which had suffered severe earthquake disasters, presented a festive scene. Colorful flags fluttered around the venue, and in front of the rostrum hung a huge banner written in both Han and Tibetan languages: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry the socialist revolution through to the end; people of all ethnic groups throughout the country unite closely and strive to build our great motherland." When the Tibetan慰问团 arrived at the venue, applause, cheers, slogans, and the sound of drums and music resounded throughout the countryside in the welcoming crowd.
    Guo Fang, member of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Governor of Hebei Province, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said that the慰问团, entrusted by the Party Committee and People's Committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Region and millions of emancipated serfs, traveled thousands of miles to bring horses to the earthquake-stricken area. This is not only a strong material support for the people in the disaster area to overcome the disaster, but more importantly, it brings great spiritual encouragement to the people in the disaster area. What the Tibetan brothers sent is not just horses, but even more valuable is the communist spirit, the deep class feelings of millions of emancipated serfs in Tibet towards the people in the disaster area of Xingtai. Such a touching thing can only happen in the era of Mao Zedong, in the socialist family under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He said that this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the ethnic policies formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Guo Fang expressed that the people of Hebei must use the material and spiritual strength sent by millions of emancipated serf brothers in the struggle to change the world and in the current struggle of the Great Cultural Revolution.
    Feng Shiying, Deputy Secretary of the Xingtai Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and Commissioner of the Xingtai Administrative Office, also spoke at the meeting. He called on the masses in the disaster area to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the emancipated farmers and herdsmen of Tibet in reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions; to learn from their deep class feelings, noble communist style, and strong revolutionary will to endure great hardship and hard work. He said that we must turn this valuable revolutionary spirit brought by Tibetan compatriots into a material force for self-reliance, hard work, development of production, and reconstruction of our homes.
    Zhang Ying, head of the Tibetan慰问团, then spoke. He said that the working people of Tibet selected a part of the horses from all parts of Tibet and sent us to express our condolences to the class brothers in the disaster area. Although there are not many horses, they represent the wishes of millions of emancipated serfs in Tibet. He said that Tibet used to be a society with the most reactionary, darkest, most barbaric, and most cruel feudal serf system, where millions of serfs lived a miserable life worse than cattle and horses. Thanks to the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the strong support of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of all ethnic groups across the country, the Tibetan people completely destroyed the evil serf system and gained emancipation and became masters of their own affairs. Zhang Ying said that after the慰问团 returns to Tibet, it must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and together with all fraternal nationalities across the country, strive to build the motherland into a great socialist power.
    Si Pingzhen, a poor peasant female commune member from the Meizhuang Brigade of the Niujiaqiao Commune and a representative of the commune members in the disaster area, said in her speech that the revolutionary spirit and noble style of the Tibetan people have set a glorious example for the people in the disaster area. She said: The poor and lower-middle peasants in the disaster area must learn from the Tibetan people in the face of the arduous task of developing production and rebuilding their homes, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, take Chairman Mao's books as the highest instruction for disaster relief and all work, and use practical actions to repay the kind concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as well as the enthusiastic support of Tibet and the people of all parts of the country.
    When the Tibetan慰问团 and the representatives of the commune members in the disaster area held the horse donation and reception ceremony, people's emotions reached a climax. The Tibetan brothers led the strong horses to the venue and handed them over to the representatives of the commune members in the disaster area. Emancipated serf Chi Lie and the representatives of the commune members in the disaster area held the same rein and sent the horse out of the venue.
    Then, Guo Fang, Vice Governor of Hebei Province, on behalf of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, presented a brocade banner to the Tibetan慰问团. On the brocade banner were written in large golden characters "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance together on the road of socialist revolution and socialist construction." At this time, prolonged applause resounded throughout the venue, filled with a warm and jubilant atmosphere.
    After the慰问团 of the Tibetan Autonomous Region arrived in Hebei Province, Liu Zihou, Second Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Hebei Province, Yan Dakai and Zhang Chengxian, Secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee, Zhao Wucheng, Secretary of the Secretariat and Second Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee, and Yang Yichen, Standing Committee member and Vice Governor of the Provincial Party Committee, met with all members of the慰问团. Chi Naiwangdui, a Communist Youth League member and mutual aid group leader from a serf background, presented a Hada to Liu Zihou. Liu Zihou also presented a Hada to the Tibetan brothers. Liu Zihou, on behalf of the people of the entire province, expressed his most sincere gratitude to the Tibetan millions of emancipated serfs for their concern and strong support for the people in the earthquake-stricken area.

    表达了百万翻身农奴的深厚阶级感情
    西藏农牧民万里送马支援邢台灾区弟兄
    邢台灾区干部社员集会热烈欢迎西藏慰问团
    新华社邢台九日电　来自邢台地震灾区的一万多干部和社员，八日在地震灾区的牛家桥公社举行集会，热烈欢迎不远万里为灾区人民送来“幸福马”的西藏自治区慰问团。参加欢迎集会的干部、社员以巨大的热情，表达灾区广大群众和河北省人民对藏族兄弟的感谢之情。
    邢台地区发生地震灾害后，西藏自治区的翻身农牧民极为关切。他们挑选了二百四十匹膘肥口轻的西藏马来支援灾区人民恢复和发展生产，又选派专人护送马匹并进行慰问。
    慰问团克服了万里长途中的种种困难，亲自将马送到邢台地震灾区。这种深情厚谊，使地震灾区的人民十分感动。六月八日天刚亮，参加欢迎大会的灾区群众从四面八方赶到会场。遭受过严重地震灾害的牛家桥，呈现出一派节日的景象。会场周围彩旗飘扬，主席台前挂着用汉藏两种文字写的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决把社会主义革命进行到底；全国各族人民紧密团结起来，为建设好伟大祖国奋勇前进”的巨幅标语。当西藏慰问团到达会场的时候，欢迎的人群中掌声、欢呼声、口号声、鼓乐声响彻村野。
    中共河北省委委员、河北省副省长郭芳在大会上致词。他说，慰问团受西藏自治区党委、人民委员会和百万翻身农奴的委托，万里迢迢，为地震灾区送来了马，这不仅对灾区人民战胜灾害是有力的物质支援，更重要的是给灾区人民带来了极大的精神鼓舞力量。藏族兄弟送来的不仅是马，更可贵的是送来了共产主义风格，送来了西藏百万翻身农奴对邢台灾区人民深厚的阶级感情。这样令人感动的事情，只有在毛泽东时代，在共产党、毛主席领导下的社会主义大家庭里才能出现。他说，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是党中央、毛主席所制订的民族政策的伟大胜利。郭芳表示，河北人民一定要把百万翻身农奴兄弟送来的物质力量和精神力量，用到改天换地的斗争中去，用到当前正在进行着的文化大革命斗争中去。
    中共邢台地委副书记、邢台专署专员冯世英也在会上讲话，他号召灾区群众学习西藏翻身农牧民读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席指示办事的革命精神；学习他们深厚的阶级感情、高尚的共产主义风格和吃大苦、耐大劳的坚强革命意志。他说，我们要把藏族同胞带来的这种可贵的革命精神，变成自力更生、奋发图强、发展生产、重建家园的物质力量。
    西藏慰问团团长张英接着讲话。他说，西藏劳动人民从西藏各地挑选了一部分马匹，派我们送来并委托我们向受灾的阶级兄弟表示慰问。马虽然不多，但是它代表了西藏百万翻身农奴的心意。他说，西藏过去是一个最反动、最黑暗、最野蛮、最残酷的封建农奴制度的社会，百万农奴过着牛马不如的悲惨生活。由于党中央、毛主席英明正确的领导，中国人民解放军和全国各民族人民的大力支援，西藏人民才彻底摧毁了万恶的农奴制度，获得了翻身解放，当家作了主人。张英表示，慰问团回到西藏后，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同全国各兄弟民族一起，为把祖国建设成伟大的社会主义强国而奋勇前进。
    灾区社员代表、牛家桥公社梅庄大队贫农女社员四平珍在讲话中说，西藏人民的革命精神和高尚风格，为灾区人民树立了光辉的榜样。她说：灾区的贫农下中农在发展生产、重建家园的艰巨任务面前，一定要向西藏人民学习，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，把毛主席的书作为抗灾斗争和一切工作的最高指示，用实际行动来报答党中央、毛主席的亲切关怀以及西藏和全国各地人民的热情支援。
    当西藏慰问团和灾区社员代表举行赠马和接马仪式的时候，人们的激情达到了高潮。藏族兄弟把健壮的马匹牵到会场，交到灾区社员代表的手里。翻身农奴赤列同灾区社员代表同牵一条缰绳，一直把马送出会场。
    接着，河北省副省长郭芳代表中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会，把一面锦旗献给西藏慰问团。锦旗上用金色大字写着“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的道路上共同前进”。这时会场上响起了经久不息的掌声，充满了热烈欢腾的气氛。
    西藏自治区慰问团到达河北省后，中共河北省委第二书记、河北省省长刘子厚，省委书记处书记阎达开、张承先，书记处书记、天津市委第二书记赵武成，省委常委、副省长杨一辰等，接见了慰问团全体成员。农奴出身的共青团员、互助组长赤乃旺堆向刘子厚献了哈达。刘子厚也向藏族兄弟献了哈达。刘子厚代表全省人民向西藏百万翻身农奴对地震灾区人民的关怀和大力支援，表示最诚挚的感谢。
