    Absolutely No Intervention by the United Nations in the Vietnam Question
    By Our Commentator
    The US imperialists, bogged down and at their wit's end in the war of aggression against Vietnam, are playing a new political trick. They are attempting to use the United Nations to "supervise" the sham "elections" of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, to "legitimize" this election farce staged under American bayonets, and to pave the way for UN intervention in the Vietnam question.
    The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on June 4, resolutely opposing the United Nations sending "observers" to "supervise" the sham "elections" in South Vietnam and opposing UN intervention in the Vietnam question, pointing out that all UN decisions related to the Vietnam question are completely invalid. The spokesman of the External Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, in a statement on June 4, also sternly condemned this deceptive act by the United States and opposed any UN interference in the internal affairs of the people of South Vietnam. The Chinese people fully support the solemn position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on this issue.
    The US-puppet clique's plan to hold so-called "elections" in September is an attempt to quell the infighting within the puppet group, ease the struggle of the South Vietnamese people, and deceive the people of the world. Anyone can see that under the circumstances of the United States dispatching 260,000 invading troops to occupy South Vietnam and wage a war of aggression, there can be no "elections" that reflect the will of the South Vietnamese people. This is a complete and utter deception. The Johnson administration is doing its utmost to hoist the banner of the United Nations in order to cover up the ugly face of the United States occupying South Vietnam and manipulating the sham "elections" in South Vietnam, and to spruce up the stinking puppet regime in order to confuse public opinion.
    Another important purpose of the US imperialists in plotting this conspiracy is to draw the United Nations into the Vietnam situation. US Representative to the United Nations Goldberg admitted that the South Vietnamese puppet's request for the United Nations to send "observers" to South Vietnam "fully reflects" the policy pursued by the United States toward South Vietnam since 1954. In that year, the United States "expressed welcome to the United Nations' participation in the Southeast Asian problem." He also said that the United States supports the proposal "to send a United Nations peacekeeping force to Vietnam." This is tantamount to admitting that the so-called UN "supervision" of the sham elections in South Vietnam is also paving the way for the United States to drag more countries into the war of aggression against Vietnam under the banner of the United Nations.
    For many years, US imperialism has been plotting to cram the United Nations, which it controls, into Vietnamese affairs. Johnson and his ilk have tirelessly touted that, on the Vietnam issue, "all the methods, capabilities, and great prestige of the United Nations" should be used. Over the past year or more, people have seen that the rostrum and corridors of the United Nations have been repeatedly used to peddle the US imperialists' "peace talks" swindle. Whenever the Johnson administration expands the war of aggression against Vietnam and massively increases troops to South Vietnam, the US representative invariably releases a "peace" smokescreen at the United Nations to cover up America's bloody hands. The United Nations has already been used by the United States as a tool to peddle "peace talks" conspiracies, cover up aggression, and deceive world public opinion. This time, the Johnson administration's plan to send "observers" to South Vietnam to "supervise" the sham elections is just another new trick by US imperialism to manipulate the United Nations in a vain attempt to interfere in Vietnamese affairs.
    The United Nations has nothing to do with the Vietnam issue. The United Nations has no right to interfere in Vietnamese affairs at all. The Vietnamese people, the people of the world, and all countries upholding justice have already seen clearly that the United Nations has long degenerated into a tool in the hands of US imperialism. Therefore, even if the arch-criminal of aggression against Vietnam, US imperialism, waves the banner of the United Nations, it cannot cover up its aggressive face and criminal acts, nor can it stop the revolutionary torrent of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation, and even less can it save US imperialism from its complete destruction in South Vietnam.

    决不容许联合国插手越南问题
    本报评论员
    在侵越战争中焦头烂额、走投无路的美帝国主义，正在玩弄一个新的政治阴谋。它企图利用联合国“监督”南越傀儡政权的伪“选举”，使这一在美国刺刀下导演的“选举”骗局“合法”化，并为联合国干涉越南问题开辟道路。
    越南民主共和国外交部发言人，六月四日就美国利用联合国“监督”南越伪“选举”的阴谋发表声明，坚决反对联合国派“观察员”“监督”南越伪“选举”，反对联合国干涉越南问题，指出联合国有关越南问题的一切决定都是完全无效的。越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会发言人，在六月四日的声明中，也严厉谴责美国的这一欺骗行径，反对联合国对越南南方人民内政进行任何干涉。中国人民完全支持越南民主共和国政府和越南南方民族解放阵线在这个问题上的严正立场。
    美伪集团策划在九月举行所谓“选举”，是企图平息傀儡集团的内讧、缓和南越人民的斗争和蒙蔽世人耳目。谁都可以看到，在美国派遣二十六万侵略军占领越南南方、进行一场侵略战争的情况下，根本不可能有反映越南南方人民意志的“选举”。这是一个彻头彻尾的骗局。约翰逊政府所以竭力要打起联合国的招牌，是要掩盖美国占领南越、操纵南越伪“选举”的丑恶面目，并把臭不可闻的傀儡政权梳妆打扮一番，借以混淆视听。
    美帝国主义策划这个阴谋，另外一个重要的目的，是要把联合国引到越南局势中去。美国驻联合国代表戈德堡承认：南越傀儡要求联合国派“观察员”到南越去，“完全反映了”美国从一九五四年以来对南越奉行的政策。在那一年美国就“表示欢迎联合国参加东南亚问题”。他还说，美国支持这样的主张：“由联合国派一支和平部队到越南”。这就不打自招地承认，所谓联合国“监督”南越伪选，也是为美国在联合国的旗号下，拖更多国家参加侵越战争铺平道路。
    多年以来，美帝国主义一直蓄谋把它控制的联合国塞进越南事务。约翰逊之流不厌其烦地鼓吹，在越南问题上，要“运用联合国的一切办法、能力和巨大威信”。最近一年多来，人们看到，联合国的讲坛和走廊，一再被用来推销美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局。每当约翰逊政府扩大侵越战火、向越南南方大举增兵之际，美国代表照例要在联合国放“和平”烟幕，掩盖美国的血手。联合国已经被美国当作推销“和谈”阴谋、掩盖侵略和欺骗世界舆论的工具。这一次约翰逊政府策划的派“观察员”到南越“监督”伪选，只是美帝国主义操纵联合国妄图插手越南事务的又一新花样而已。
    联合国同越南问题没有任何关系。联合国根本无权干涉越南事务。越南人民、全世界人民以及一切主持正义的国家，都已经看清，联合国早已堕落成为美帝国主义手中的工具。因此，侵略越南的元凶美帝国主义即使打着联合国的招牌，既掩盖不了自己的侵略面目和罪恶行径，也无法阻挡越南南方人民抗美救国斗争的革命洪流，更无法挽救美帝国主义在越南南方彻底覆灭的命运。
