    Albanian "Unity" Newspaper Exposes Soviet Leaders' Collusion with U.S. Imperialism Against People of All Countries
    Soviet Leaders are Birds of a Feather with Imperialists and Reactionaries
    They Say They are Friends of the Vietnamese People but are Actually Supporters of U.S. Aggression

    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 2nd -- The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an article on the 2nd exposing how the Khrushchev revisionists use double-dealing tactics and collude with U.S. imperialism to oppose the people of all countries.
    The article, entitled "The Words and Deeds of the Khrushchev Revisionists," stated that the Khrushchev revisionists "verbally adorn themselves as 'anti-imperialist,' but in action they cooperate with imperialists on all important international issues. They support oppression and exploitation, and cooperate with the most疯狂反革命 forces [frenzied counter-revolutionary forces]."
    The article pointed out that when the U.S. imperialists are frantically preparing to expand the entire Southeast Asian war, "the Khrushchev revisionists not only do not oppose them in the slightest, but instead help the U.S. imperialists. Since last October, representatives of the Soviet revisionist leaders have sat side-by-side with representatives of the United States and its servants, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, South Vietnam, and South Korea, participating in seven conferences related to Southeast Asian and Far Eastern issues; at the same time, they are doing everything possible to get closer to the Indonesian right-wing military fascist regime, which has massacred hundreds of thousands of Indonesian patriots and communists. Is this not helping the Indonesian reactionaries?"
    The article said, "Not only that, but the Soviet revisionist leaders continue to provide large amounts of comprehensive assistance to the Indian reactionaries, who serve U.S. imperialism in Asia as provocateurs. The people of Asian countries are angered to learn that recently, five Soviet ships fully loaded with weapons, aircraft, tanks, and munitions were unloading in Calcutta. Ironically, when Soviet weapons were being transported to India, a Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation headed by Soviet First Deputy Premier Mazurov was in Pakistan, and Mazurov hypocritically talked to the Pakistanis about friendship and peace."
    The article pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leaders' provision of weapons to India through the Indian Ocean exposes their two-faced policy on the Vietnam issue in broad daylight. In order to defend their insufficient assistance to the struggle of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam against the American bandit invasion in front of public opinion, the Soviet revisionist leaders claimed that the obstacle was that they did not share a common border with Vietnam. But people will rightfully ask: "The Soviet Union does not share a common border with India, but aid to the Indian reactionaries is transported by sea. Why can't this be done for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam?" The answer is simple: the Soviet revisionist leaders verbally portray themselves as friends of the Vietnamese people, and even clamor about their insignificant aid to Vietnam, while in reality they support the U.S. aggressors, attempting to reach an agreement with the U.S. aggressors as soon as possible to jointly dominate the world.
    The article concluded, "The people of all countries know how to evaluate people from their actions rather than their words, and they regard the Khrushchev revisionists as birds of a feather with imperialists, reactionaries, and all puppets."

    阿《团结报》揭露苏联领导勾结美帝反对各国人民
    苏联领导同帝国主义和反动派是一丘之貉
    他们口头上说是越南人民的朋友实际上是美国侵略的支持者
    新华社地拉那二日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二日发表一篇文章，揭露赫鲁晓夫修正主义者玩弄两面手法，同美帝国主义进行勾结，反对各国人民。
    这篇题为《赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的言论和行动》的文章说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者“在口头上把自己打扮成是‘反帝的’，而在行动上则在所有重要国际问题上与帝国主义者合作。他们支持压迫与剥削，和最疯狂的反革命势力合作”。
    文章指出，当美帝国主义者正在疯狂准备扩大整个东南亚战争时，“赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不仅丝毫不反对他们，反而给美帝国主义者帮忙。从去年十月份以来，苏联修正主义领导人的代表就与美国及其仆从台湾蒋介石集团、南越、南朝鲜的代表肩并肩地坐在一起，参加了与东南亚和远东问题有关的七个会议；同时，他们还千方百计地与屠杀了几十万印度尼西亚爱国者和共产党人的印度尼西亚右派军事法西斯政权靠拢。这难道不是对印度尼西亚反动集团的帮助吗？”
    文章说，“不仅如此，苏联修正主义领导人还继续给予在亚洲为美帝国主义效劳的挑衅者印度反动派以大量和全面的援助。亚洲各国人民愤怒地获悉，最近，满载着武器、飞机、坦克和军火的五艘苏联船只正在加尔各答卸货。具有讽刺意味的是，当苏联武器运到印度时，以苏联部长会议第一副主席马祖罗夫为首的苏联最高苏维埃代表团正在巴基斯坦，马祖罗夫还虚伪透顶地对巴基斯坦人谈论什么友谊与和平”。
    文章指出，苏联修正主义领导人通过印度洋向印度提供武器，把他们在越南问题上奉行的两面政策暴露于光天化日之下。苏联修正主义领导人为了在公众舆论面前替自己对越南民主共和国反对美国强盗进攻的斗争所给予的很不够的帮助辩解，声称障碍是来自他们同越南没有共同边界。但是人们会理所当然地问：“苏联同印度没有共同边界，但是对印度反动派的援助却从海上运去了。为什么不能对越南民主共和国也这样做呢？”回答是简单的：苏联修正主义领导人在口头上把自己说成是越南人民的朋友，甚至还为他们对越南微不足道的援助大叫大嚷，而实际上他们支持美国侵略者，企图与美国侵略者尽快地达成一项共同主宰世界的协议。
    文章最后说，“各国人民懂得从行动上而不是从言论上来评价人，他们把赫鲁晓夫修正主义者同帝国主义者、反动派以及所有傀儡看作一丘之貉。”
