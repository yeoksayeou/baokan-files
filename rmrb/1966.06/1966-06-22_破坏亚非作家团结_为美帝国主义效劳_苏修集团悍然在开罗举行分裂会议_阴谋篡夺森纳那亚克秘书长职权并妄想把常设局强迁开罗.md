    Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: Our reporter reports: The Soviet revisionist clique, using the name of the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau, held a split meeting in Cairo on the 19th and 20th. The result of this illegal meeting thoroughly exposed the heinous face of the Soviet revisionist group brazenly and openly splitting and destroying the anti-imperialist movement of Asian-African people and Asian-African writers' solidarity.
    The Soviet revisionist clique hastily gathered a small group of revisionists, rightists, and splitters to hold this split meeting on the eve of the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau's meeting scheduled to begin in Beijing on the 23rd. This split meeting passed a "resolution" clamoring to "request the organization of the Arab Republic of Egypt to recommend a person to assume the post of Secretary-General [of the Permanent Bureau], replacing the current incumbent," which, in the words of the Middle East News Agency of the Arab Republic of Egypt, is called "dismissing" the legitimate Secretary-General of the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau, Senanayake. The "resolution" also clamored to move the Permanent Bureau from Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, to Cairo, the capital of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and to illegally convene an Asian-African Writers' Conference in Baku, Soviet Union, in August this year.
    Secretary-General Senanayake of the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau was legitimately produced by the Asian-African Writers' Conference. Only he has the power to convene a meeting of the Permanent Bureau. The upcoming Permanent Bureau meeting and the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing were decided by the Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau after full consultation with the member states. So why do the Soviet revisionists want to use an illegally convened meeting to "dismiss" a legitimately produced Secretary-General?
    A message from the Cairo newspaper Al-Gomhouria revealed the truth. This newspaper reported on the 20th that representatives of the Soviet Union and others at the Cairo split meeting "accused Senanayake of refusing to receive a famous Soviet writer when Soviet writers went to Ceylon and demanded his dismissal." This reveals that the Soviet revisionist clique hates Senanayake mainly because it wants to force Senanayake to follow its baton, sabotage the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting, and force the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau to become a tool for implementing its policy of "US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world." Its conspiracy failed, and it became enraged and had to get rid of him.
    The split meeting's attempt to forcibly abduct the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau to Cairo completely exposed the conspiracy of some people to turn the Asian-African writers' movement into an organization subordinate to the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo.
    The Cairo split meeting passed a "resolution" to "hold a meeting attended by writers from Asian-African countries in Baku, Azerbaijan [of the Soviet Union] in August this year to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people" (Middle East News Agency), which also contains extremely malicious conspiracies. As everyone knows, the Soviet revisionist clique is pursuing a sinister policy of false support and real betrayal on the Vietnam issue. This time, it is desperately obstructing and undermining the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau's convening of the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing because this meeting is to resolutely support the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression. The split meeting held by the Soviet revisionist clique in Cairo, in order to conceal its traitorous face, also hypocritically expressed "condemnation" of American aggression against Vietnam. However, a "resolution" it passed does not mention the basic demands of the Vietnamese people, the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, nor does it mention the demand for the immediate withdrawal of American aggressor troops from South Vietnam, but intentionally raises the so-called "another world disaster," which is actually a foreshadowing of cooperating with American imperialism to extinguish the national liberation war of the South Vietnamese people. This "resolution" also once again brought out the so-called "preconditions" for solving the Vietnam issue, which had been exposed and criticized by representatives of China and Albania at the Geneva World Peace Council, serving Johnson's "peace talks" conspiracy.
    The Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau held an emergency meeting in Beijing on the 20th, at which a statement was unanimously adopted, denouncing the Soviet splitters for holding a split meeting in Cairo, sabotaging the cause of Asian-African people's solidarity against imperialism, and announced that "the Permanent Bureau meeting will be held in Beijing as scheduled from June 23 to 24, 1966, and the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting will be held in Beijing from June 27 to July 6, 1966." This is a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist clique. The Soviet revisionist clique's conspiracy to usurp the Permanent Bureau has failed, and it has once again nakedly exposed its true face as an accomplice of American imperialism in front of Asian-African writers, Asian-African people, and the people of the world.

### 破坏亚非作家团结　为美帝国主义效劳  苏修集团悍然在开罗举行分裂会议  阴谋篡夺森纳那亚克秘书长职权并妄想把常设局强迁开罗

    破坏亚非作家团结　为美帝国主义效劳
    苏修集团悍然在开罗举行分裂会议
    阴谋篡夺森纳那亚克秘书长职权并妄想把常设局强迁开罗
    新华社二十一日讯　本社记者报道：苏联修正主义集团盗用亚非作家常设局的名义，于十九日和二十日在开罗召开了分裂会议。这次非法会议的结果，彻底暴露了苏联修正主义某团悍然公开分裂和破坏亚非人民和亚非作家团结反帝运动的罪恶面目。
    苏联修正主义集团选择在亚非作家常设局即将于二十三日开始在北京举行会议的前夕匆匆忙忙地纠集了一小撮修正主义者、右派和分裂分子，召开这个分裂会议。这个分裂会议通过“决议”，叫嚷“要求阿联本国的组织推荐一个人担任（常设局）秘书长的职务，取代目前的在职者”，用阿联中东通讯社的说法，叫做“开除”合法的亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克的职务。“决议”还叫嚷要把常设局从锡兰首都科伦坡迁到阿联首都开罗去，今年八月间在苏联的巴库非法召开亚非作家会议。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克是由亚非作家会议合法产生的。只有他，才有权力召开常设局会议。即将在北京举行的常设局会议和亚非作家紧急会议，就是由常设局秘书长在同各成员国充分协商后做出的决定。那么苏联修正主义者究竟为什么想用一个非法召开的会议来“开除”一个合法产生的秘书长呢？
    开罗《共和国报》的一条消息露出了马脚。这家报纸二十日报道，苏联等代表在开罗分裂会议上“指责森纳那亚克在苏联作家去锡兰时曾拒绝接待一个著名的苏联作家，并要求解除他的职务”。这就暴露了：苏联修正主义集团痛恨森纳那亚克，主要是因为它要强迫森纳那亚克跟它的指挥棒转，破坏亚非作家紧急会议，并迫使亚非作家常设局成为它执行“美苏合作主宰世界”政策的工具的阴谋没有得逞，因而恼羞成怒，非要把他搞掉不可。
    分裂会议企图把亚非作家常设局强行劫夺到开罗去，完全暴露了有些人企图把亚非作家运动变成从属于开罗的亚非人民团结组织书记处的机构的阴谋。
    开罗分裂会议通过“决议”要“在今年八月在（苏联）阿塞拜疆的巴库举行有亚非国家作家参加的会议，以支持越南人民的斗争”（中东通讯社），这也包含着极端恶毒的阴谋。大家知道，苏联修正主义集团在越南问题上，执行着阴险的假支持真出卖的政策。它这一次拼命阻挠和破坏亚非作家常设局在北京召开亚非作家紧急会议，就是因为这个会议是为了坚决支持越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争。苏联修正主义集团在开罗搞的分裂会议，为了掩饰其叛徒面目，也假惺惺地表示“谴责”美国侵略越南。但是它通过的一个“决议”，通篇只字不提越南人民的基本要求：越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明和越南民主共和国政府的四项主张，只字不提要求美国侵略军立即撤出南越，却别有用心地提出所谓“另一次世界性灾难”，这实际上是作为同美帝国主义合作扑灭南越人民民族解放战争的一个伏笔。这个“决议”还又一次端出了在日内瓦世界和平理事会上被中国和阿尔巴尼亚代表所揭露批判过的所谓解决越南问题的“前提”，为约翰逊的“和谈”阴谋效劳。
    亚非作家常设局二十日在北京召开紧急会议，会上一致通过一项声明，痛斥苏联分裂主义者在开罗召开分裂会议，破坏亚非人民团结反帝的事业，并且宣布，“一九六六年六月二十三日至二十四日将如期在北京召开常设局会议，并将于一九六六年六月二十七日至七月六日在北京召开亚非作家紧急会议。”这是对苏联修正主义集团的沉重打击。苏联修正主义集团篡夺常设局的阴谋失败了，而且它在亚非作家以及亚非人民和全世界人民面前，又一次赤裸裸地暴露了它作为美帝国主义帮凶的真面目。
