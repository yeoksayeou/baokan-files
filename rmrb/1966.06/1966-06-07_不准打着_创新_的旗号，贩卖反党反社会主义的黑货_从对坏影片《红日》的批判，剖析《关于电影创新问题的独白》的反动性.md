    It is Forbidden to Sell Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Goods Under the Guise of "Innovation"
    --An Analysis of the Reactionary Nature of "Monologue on the Issue of Film Innovation" from the Criticism of the Bad Film "Red Sun"
    Hong Jian
    The Film "Red Sun" is Diametrically Opposed to Mao Zedong Thought
    The film "Red Sun" is a major poisonous weed meticulously produced under the guidance of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, and is a representative work of modern revisionist literature and art.
    It obliterates the fundamental distinction between just and unjust wars.
    Chairman Mao said: "Historically, there are only two kinds of wars, just and unjust. We support just wars and oppose unjust wars. All counter-revolutionary wars are unjust, and all revolutionary wars are just." The Chinese People's War of Liberation was a revolutionary and just war under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, while the war waged by the Kuomintang reactionaries was an anti-communist and anti-people unjust war. However, in the film "Red Sun," only the confrontation between the enemy and our army is seen, but the political purpose of the military struggle is not visible. The support of the people is absent, and the unique strengths of our army and the enemy's fatal weaknesses are also missing. The contention between the two armies becomes a contention between two super-class military groups; the war activities of the two armies become simple military activities of you eliminating me and me eliminating you; the comparison of the strength of the two armies becomes a simple comparison of military strength; the victory or defeat of the two armies becomes an accidental outcome. This is an arbitrary distortion of the history of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, applying rouge and powder to the unjust counter-revolutionary war, and smearing the just revolutionary war. The film, from beginning to end, praises and establishes monuments for Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army, and comprehensively vilifies the people's army and people's war led by the Party and Chairman Mao, precisely starting from the fundamental point of confusing the just and unjust nature of war.
    It obliterates the fundamental distinction between the people's army and the counter-revolutionary army.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. "To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." However, in the film "Red Sun," the essential characteristics that distinguish our army from all reactionary armies are absent. Our army has neither unity between officers and soldiers, unity between the army and the people, unity between the army and the government, nor a high degree of class consciousness, strict discipline, and heroic spirit that overwhelms all enemies. On the contrary, all the base and filthy things inherent in the reactionary army are imposed on our army. The victorious people's army led by the Party and Chairman Mao is丑化de beyond recognition: political corruption, disunity, lax discipline, complacency, rudeness, rampant individualism, prevalence of warlordism... and so on, and so forth. However, Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary army, which is decadent, declining, and thoroughly reactionary, is portrayed as being mighty, heroic, indomitable, resourceful, and heroically unparalleled! The screenwriters have stolen the sky and changed the day, reversed black and white, and confused right and wrong to the extreme.
    It also obliterates the fundamental distinction between the proletarian military line and the bourgeois military line.
    Politics is the commander, is the soul. Political work is the lifeline of our army. The core of Chairman Mao's military thinking is that the people's army must highlight politics and build the army politically. The film "Red Sun" not only fails to show this fundamental symbol that distinguishes the proletarian military line from the bourgeois military line, but also strives to eliminate the Party's absolute leadership over our army, vilifies our army's political work,丑化s political work cadres, and degrades the power of political work; it desperately promotes the bourgeois purely military viewpoint, peddles the "one-chief system," and advocates that it is possible to defeat the enemy without proletarian politics, attempting to guide our army onto the wrong path!
    Confusing the nature of the two wars, opposing the people's war; confusing the nature of the two armies, attacking the people's army; confusing the nature of the two military lines, abolishing the proletarian military line; this is the maliciousness of the film "Red Sun"! The screenwriters openly sang a tune diametrically opposed to Mao Zedong Thought.
    "Monologue on the Issue of Film Innovation" is a Modern Revisionist Film Program
    The film "Red Sun" is a work of "creating a new generation," which was heavily touted by its editor, Qu Baiyin, and is an artistic practice of his reactionary literary and artistic views.
    Qu Baiyin's reactionary literary and artistic views have formed a complete set of theories, which is the "Monologue on the Issue of Film Innovation" thrown out in "Film Art" in June 1962. He "vociferously" called out the slogan of "innovation," openly clamoring: "Works that create a new generation' must have three elements: new ideas - the writer's unique insights into life; new images - personalities that are budding and growing in life, or that the writer has uniquely discovered and created; new artistic conceptions - new situations that the writer has discovered and created using imagination."
    "Red Sun" is a film produced under the guidance of this set of theories and fully embodies this set of theories.
    Through the analysis of this film, we can clearly see what kind of goods this set of theories is peddling!
      "New ideas - the writer's unique insights into life" is the soul of Qu Baiyin's theory. He lists "removing clichés in thought" as "the first element of works that create a new generation.'" He emphasizes that one must "see what others have not seen and say what others have not said." "Red Sun" does indeed express a very blatant "unique insight" that is different from others. That is to obliterate the fundamental differences between just and unjust wars, revolutionary armies and reactionary armies, and proletarian military lines and bourgeois military lines; to丑化the people's army and attack the people's war in every possible way; to beautify the counter-revolutionary army and praise the unjust war against communism and the people in every possible way. The screenwriters are truly "seeing what others have not seen and saying what others have not said," openly singing a different tune with the universally applicable truth - Mao Zedong Thought. From this, we can clearly see what kind of goods Qu Baiyin's "removal of clichés in thought" and "unique insights into life" are. He maliciously attacked our revolutionary literature and art as being "filled with clichés," "repeating in works the instructions of documents and what has been said thousands of times in classic works," and "repeating or illustrating well-known ideas." He gnashed his teeth and cursed that "all kinds of clichés have theoretical basis, are clichés, but are very correct, so they are sometimes considered 'absolute truth' and have the protection of gods." He frantically slandered us for "scattering all kinds of talismans and incantations about what should and should not be done all over the sky," and arrogantly clamored to "remove these excessive frames that bind us." This is a blatant spearhead directly aimed at the great Mao Zedong Thought, opposing the use of Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, promote everything, and transform everything, and fundamentally eliminating the great Mao Zedong Thought as the supreme instruction in the literary and artistic field. Qu Baiyin hates Mao Zedong Thought to the bone, like a mad dog barking at the sun, baring his fangs and claws, revealing a hideous anti-Party and anti-socialist face. In fact, his "insights" are not "unique" at all. This is no different from the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng cursing Chairman Mao's works as "totems." We have long heard this kind of hateful voice from a small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. Qu Baiyin is just repeating the old tune!
    According to Qu Baiyin's theory, "the second element of works that create a new generation'" is "shaping new images." He made a special explanation for this kind of image: "Heroic figures are not always standing tall with chests puffed out and eyes glaring; evil villains are not all shifty-eyed and grimacing." The characters that appear in "Red Sun" are precisely copied according to this "prescription": revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only "shifty-eyed and grimacing," but also crude, barbaric, stupid, and crestfallen; counter-revolutionary elements are not only "standing tall with chests puffed out and eyes glaring," but also refined, firm, wise, and heroic. Revolutionary fighters who unite and fight for the interests of the broad masses of people have become "cowards," and the executioners who are anti-communist and anti-people have become "heroes." The people's army that serves the people wholeheartedly has become a "motley crowd"; the reactionary army that rapes, loots, burns, and kills the people has become a "benevolent army." The people's army, from the army commander to the soldiers, from political struggle to military struggle, is丑化de and vilified to the extreme; while the reactionary officers who are condemned by thousands of people are beautified and praised to the extreme, from their inner world to their external physique, from the trivialities of life to the moment of life and death. Reversing right and wrong, confusing black and white, completely reversing the revolutionary fighters and counter-revolutionary elements, and turning the reactionary bandits into positive characters, this is the "new image" created and promoted by Qu Baiyin! It is not difficult for us to discover that the "personality" that he advocates "is budding and growing in life" is the anti-Party and anti-socialist personality; the personality that he advocates "has not been discovered by anyone, or has been discovered but has not been expressed" is the reactionary personality of the class enemies who have been overthrown, or the newly emerging bourgeois elements. What is new about these images? They are nothing more than variations of the old images of landlords, bourgeois masters, ladies, and young masters who have ruled the literary and artistic field for thousands of years. And the theory of promoting this kind of "new image" is the theory that Chairman Mao severely criticized twenty-four years ago, the theory of bourgeois writers who "write the revolutionary masses as rioters and write themselves as sacred"!
    "New artistic conceptions" are listed by Qu Baiyin as the third element of works that create a "new generation." And "imagination" is designated by him as "the primary condition for artistic conception." He repeatedly advocates that writers should have "the wings of imagination" and be able to "fly," so that "new situations are inexhaustible." The artistic practice of "Red Sun" has indeed proved this point. The anti-Party and anti-socialist Qu Baiyin opened his "wings of imagination" and "flew." The original active transfer of our army, which was based on Chairman Mao's strategic thinking, with the purpose, plan, and organization to lure the enemy deep and annihilate the enemy, became a rout and escape in a sorry state! The enemy, who was originally at the end of his rope, collapsing, pessimistic, desperate, and waiting to be captured, became flexible, calm, calm, and fearless in the face of danger! What should have been praised has become exposed! What should have been exposed has become praised! What a pair of "wings of imagination," what a peculiar "flight"! Flying, flying, flying to the clouds, completely separated from the only source of literature and art, the people's life, fundamentally opposing the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary reality is distorted, revolutionary history is arbitrarily fabricated, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can be ignored, relying on his bourgeois reactionary nature, he can deceive people as he pleases, scold whoever he wants, and do everything as he pleases. This is the wonderful use of the "wings of imagination," this is the purpose of the "new situation." This is exactly the same as the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng's "self-embracing," "self-expansion," and "subjective fighting spirit." From here, we also see through the "secret" of Qu Baiyin's advocacy of "new artistic conceptions." It turns out that what he said about "Are the wings of imagination bound? Are they hurt? Are they broken? Have they not grown yet? Do they not exist at all? Those that are bound must be liberated, those that are hurt must be healed; those that are broken must be grafted, those that have not grown must be nurtured, those that do not exist at all... would it be more suitable to do work that does not require imagination?" is to fan the flames and call on those demons and monsters in the literary and artistic circles who are "bound," "hurt," and "broken" to come out quickly, is to drive the revolutionary literary and artistic workers who adhere to Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line out of the literary and artistic positions, and is to usurp the proletariat's leadership in the literary and artistic field! Is this some new theory? No! This is the counter-revolutionary restoration dream that bourgeois writers have always been making.
    Looking at Qu Baiyin's artistic practice from his literary and artistic views, the "innovation" slogan and the "three elements" of "works that create a new generation'" put forward in "Monologue on the Issue of Film Innovation" systematically and completely demonstrate the reactionary nature of Qu Baiyin's theory. That is: using anti-Party and anti-socialist "new ideas" to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, using the "new images" of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to squeeze out the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and using the bourgeois "new artistic conceptions" to allow demons and monsters to occupy the proletariat's literary and artistic positions and carry out the bourgeois counter-revolutionary restoration. His theory, "Monologue on the Issue of Film Innovation," is an out-and-out modern revisionist film program; and his creation, "Red Sun," is an artistic specimen of modern revisionist film!
    Qu Baiyin shot two poisonous arrows from a black string
    The emergence of Qu Baiyin's creation and theory is not an accidental and isolated phenomenon. It is a hybrid of modern revisionist literature and art and the so-called literature and art of the 1930s, and a manifestation of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two ideologies of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the literary and artistic field.
    Qu Baiyin's creation and theory are a replica of modern revisionist literature and art.
    Around 1962, just as Qu Baiyin was carrying out his creative practice and theoretical exploration, the international trend of modern revisionism was rampant. Modern revisionist film "masters" such as Chukhrai, Gerasimov, and Rom repeatedly declared: "Resolutely oppose all explicitly stipulated and unchangeable artistic positions," "What creates literature is talented people, not 'ists' and 'isms.'" Poisonous weeds of modern revisionist films, such as "The Fate of a Man," "Ballad of a Soldier," and "Ivan's Childhood," emerged in large numbers. This evil wind made Qu Baiyin, who insisted on the anti-Party and anti-socialist stand, very fascinated. He felt: "The evening breeze of early spring, although still chilly, feels very comfortable on the face. It also brings all kinds of thoughts." He questioned: "A wave of film art innovation is sweeping the world, why don't we need innovation? Can't we innovate?" Isn't his reactionary creation and theory the "ghost fetus" that he received from the trend of modern revisionism very clear?
    Qu Baiyin's creation and theory are also products of the so-called literature and art of the 1930s.
    Also around 1962, a small group of bourgeois representatives in the domestic literary and artistic circles vigorously advocated the revival of the so-called literature and art of the 1930s, and the sharp voices were rampant for a while. Xia Yan, one of the active advocates of the "literature and art of the 1930s," raised the black flag of "leaving the revolutionary scriptures and rebelling against the path of war" in the film industry in 1959, and Qu Baiyin also praised vociferously that "the 1930s was an era of vigorous innovation," boasting that in the so-called 1930s, "works with new ideas, new images, and new artistic conceptions surged onto the screen like a surging spring tide," emphasizing the need to "inherit" the "tradition" of the so-called films of the 1930s. His creation and theory are precisely in the same vein as the literature and art of the so-called 1930s!
    It was precisely at the time when the modern revisionist literary and artistic thought and the so-called literary and artistic thought of the 1930s were making waves, when the international anti-China chorus was at its highest pitch, and Chiang Kai-shek was also clamoring arrogantly to窜犯 the mainland, that Qu Baiyin impatiently presented "Red Sun" and threw out "Monologue," shooting two poisonous arrows from a black string.
    Is Qu Baiyin's set of black theories innovation? Not at all. It is nothing more than picking up the teeth of modern revisionist literature and art and following the old ways of the so-called literature and art of the 1930s! This is a historical reaction!
    Proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic workers never oppose innovation. We have always advocated "originality." However, contrary to Qu Baiyin and his ilk, what we mark is the newness of socialism, and what we establish is the difference of the proletariat. We vigorously promote proletarian ideology and vigorously eliminate bourgeois ideology. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, meticulously shape the glorious images of worker-peasant-soldier hero characters, and strive to create revolutionary literary and artistic works that reflect the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian era. This kind of proletarian innovative work is the newest, most beautiful, and most brilliant revolutionary literature and art that completely breaks with the ideology of all exploiting classes and creates a new era in human history. Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, our revolutionary literary and artistic workers and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have already created many excellent works. They have delineated a completely new era in both content and form. Revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Raid on the White Tiger Regiment," ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," "The White-Haired Girl," symphonic music "Shajiabang," clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard," novel "Ouyang Hai's Song," etc., are some of the innovative achievements of proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic workers. Qu Baiyin and his ilk, under the banner of "innovation," are attempting to sell anti-Party and anti-socialist black goods, which will never succeed!
    Under the traction of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, the film "Red Sun" once won the applause of a small group of people, and "Monologue on the Issue of Film Innovation" was also praised by a small group of people. Qu Baiyin then ambitiously encouraged himself to be "persevering" and "unyielding"; shouted aggressively that "innovation is for struggle. Only innovation can win the victory in this struggle"; and barked and insulted us as "ants" and "lame donkeys," saying that "ants complain that flying dragons do not follow the steps to climb up, and that they fly straight up to the sky; lame donkeys complain that fine horses do not walk step by step, and that they take a thousand miles in one step." Challenging us!
    Now, it is time to ban black goods and eradicate poisonous weeds. We unambiguously accept the challenges of Qu Baiyin and all the "heroes" of the black line. Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we have the courage, confidence, and strength to thoroughly oppose the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line and resolutely carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end! History has already and will continue to prove that the real flying dragons and fine horses are the proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic workers! And Qu Baiyin and his ilk are the real ants and lame donkeys!

    不准打着“创新”的旗号，贩卖反党反社会主义的黑货
    ——从对坏影片《红日》的批判，剖析《关于电影创新问题的独白》的反动性
    洪剑
    影片《红日》同毛泽东思想大唱反调
    影片《红日》，是在反党反社会主义黑线指导下精心制作出来的一株大毒草，是现代修正主义文艺的一部代表作。
    它抹煞了正义战争和非正义战争的根本区别。
    毛主席说：“历史上的战争，只有正义的和非正义的两类。我们是拥护正义战争反对非正义战争的。一切反革命战争都是非正义的，一切革命战争都是正义的。”中国人民解放战争是在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的革命的正义的战争，国民党反动派所进行的战争是反共反人民的非正义的战争。而在影片《红日》里，只见敌我两军对垒，却看不出军事斗争的政治目的，人心的向背不见了，我军所独有的长处和敌人的致命弱点也不见了。两军之争，成了两个超阶级的军事集团之争；两军的战争活动，成了你消灭我、我消灭你的单纯军事活动；两军的力量对比，成了单纯军事力量的对比；两军的胜负，成了偶然的结局。这是任意歪曲第三次国内革命战争的历史，为非正义的反革命战争涂脂抹粉，给正义的革命战争涂灰抹黑。影片自始至终为蒋介石的反动军队歌功颂德、立传树碑，全面诋毁党和毛主席所领导的人民军队人民战争，正是从混淆战争的正义性和非正义性这一根本点出发的。
    它抹煞了人民军队和反革命军队的根本区别。
    中国人民解放军是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民子弟兵。“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”但是，在影片《红日》里，我军区别于一切反动军队的本质特点都不见了。我军既没有官兵一致、军民一致、军政一致，也没有高度的阶级觉悟、严明的纪律、压倒一切敌人的英雄气概。相反，一切为反动军队所固有的卑污恶浊，都横加在我军身上。党和毛主席所领导的胜利了的人民军队被丑化得面目全非：政治腐败，团结涣散，纪律松弛，居功骄傲，粗鲁横蛮，个人主义泛滥，军阀作风盛行……如此等等，不一而足。可是，腐朽没落反动透顶的蒋介石的反革命军队，却被描绘得威武雄壮，顽强不屈，足智多谋，英雄盖世！编导者偷天换日，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，以至于极。
    它还抹煞了无产阶级军事路线和资产阶级军事路线的根本区别。
    政治是统帅，是灵魂。政治工作是我军的生命线。毛主席建军思想的核心就是人民军队一定要突出政治，从政治上建军。影片《红日》，不仅没有表现无产阶级军事路线区别于资产阶级军事路线的这一根本标志，而且竭力取消党对我军的绝对领导，诋毁我军的政治工作，丑化政治工作干部，贬低政治工作的威力；拼命宣扬资产阶级的单纯军事观点，兜售“一长制”，鼓吹离开无产阶级政治一样能够克敌制胜，妄图把我军引导到邪路上去！
    混淆两种战争的性质，反对人民战争；混淆两种军队的性质，攻击人民军队；混淆两条军事路线的性质，取消无产阶级军事路线；这就是影片《红日》的恶毒所在！编导者明目张胆地和毛泽东思想大唱反调。
    《关于电影创新问题的独白》是现代修正主义的电影纲领
    影片《红日》是它的编者瞿白音所大肆吹嘘的“创‘一代之新’”的作品，是他的反动文艺主张在艺术上的实践。
    瞿白音的反动文艺主张，已经形成一整套理论，那就是一九六二年六月在《电影艺术》上抛出的《关于电影创新问题的独白》。他“大声疾呼”
  “创新”的口号，公然叫嚷：“创‘一代之新’的作品似乎必须具备三个要素：新的思想——作家对生活的独特见解；新的形象——生活中正在萌芽滋长，或作家独具慧眼发现和创造了的性格；新的艺术构思——作家运用想象发现和创造了的新的情境。”
    《红日》就是在这套理论指导下产生的、全面体现了这套理论的影片。
    通过对于这部影片的剖析，我们就能够清楚地看到这套理论贩卖的是一些什么样的货色！
      “新的思想——作家对生活的独特见解”，是瞿白音的理论的灵魂。他把“去除思想上的陈言”列为“创‘一代之新’的作品的第一个要素”。他强调，要“见人之所未见，言人之所未言”。《红日》的确是十分露骨地表达了一种与众不同的“独特的见解”。那就是一笔抹煞正义战争与非正义战争、革命军队与反动军队、无产阶级军事路线与资产阶级军事路线的根本区别；无孔不入地丑化人民军队，攻击人民战争；无微不至地美化反革命军队，歌颂反共反人民的不义战争。编导者果真是“见人之所未见，言人之所未言”，公然与众不同地和放之四海而皆准的普遍真理——毛泽东思想大唱反调。由此，我们就清楚地看到，瞿白音要“去除思想上的陈言”和“对生活的独特见解”到底是什么货色了。他恶毒地攻击我们革命的文艺是“陈言充斥”，“在作品中复述文件指示、经典著作中讲过千百次的话”，“复述或图解众所周知的思想”。他咬牙切齿咒骂“各类陈言都有理论根据，是陈言，但是很正确，所以它有时被认为‘绝对真理’有了神灵的呵护”。他疯狂诬蔑我们“满天撒下应该怎样、不应该怎样的各种符录和咒语”，狂妄叫嚣“驱除这些束缚我们的过多的框框”。这是锋芒毕露地把矛头直接指向伟大的毛泽东思想，针锋相对地反对用毛泽东思想去统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切，要在文艺领域中从根本上取消以伟大的毛泽东思想为最高指示。瞿白音对毛泽东思想恨之入骨，象一头疯狗，对着太阳狂吠，他剑拔弩张，张牙舞爪，露出一副反党反社会主义的狰狞面目。其实，他的
  “见解”也并不“独特”。这和反革命分子胡风把毛主席著作骂作“图腾”，并无二致。我们早从一小撮反党反社会主义分子那里，听到过这种仇恨的声音。瞿白音不过旧调重弹而已！
    按照瞿白音的理论，“创‘一代之新’的作品的第二个要素”，是“塑造新的形象”。对于这种形象，他特别作了交代：“英雄人物并非随时随地挺胸凸肚、怒目圆睁；奸恶之徒也并非都鼠目獐头、呲牙咧嘴”。《红日》中所出现的人物，正是按照这张“单方”如法炮制出来的：革命工农兵，不仅“鼠目獐头、呲牙咧嘴”，而且粗野、蛮横、愚蠢、灰溜溜；反革命分子，不仅“挺胸凸肚、怒目圆睁”，而且斯文、坚定、明智、雄赳赳。为着广大人民群众的利益而结合而战斗的革命战士，成了“熊包”，反共反人民的刽子手，成了“英雄”。全心全意为人民服务的人民军队，成了“乌合之众”；奸淫烧杀残害人民的反动军队成了“仁义之师”。对人民军队，从军长到战士，从政治斗争到军事斗争，丑化和诬蔑得无所不用其极；而对千夫所指万恶不赦的反动军官，则从内心世界到外表体型，从生活小节到生死关头，都美化和赞扬得无以复加。正反颠倒，黑白混淆，把革命战士与反革命分子完全翻了个个儿，把反动匪徒当成正面人物，这就是瞿白音所创造并鼓吹的“新的形象”！我们由此不难发现，他提倡的“生活中正在萌芽、滋长”的“性格”，就是反党反社会主义的性格；他鼓吹的“还没有人发现，或发现了还没有人表现”的性格，就是被打倒了的阶级敌人，或新生的资产阶级分子的反动性格。这些形象，何新之有？他们不过是千百年来统治着文艺领域的地主阶级资产阶级老爷太太公子小姐的旧形象的变种罢了。而提倡这种“新的形象”的理论，则是毛主席二十四年前就已经严厉批判过的，资产阶级文艺家的“把革命群众写成暴徒，把他们自己写成神圣”的理论！
    “新的艺术构思”被瞿白音列为创“一代之新”的作品的第三个要素。而“想象”，则被他指定为“艺术构思的首要条件”。他一再鼓吹作家要有“想象的翅膀”，要会“飞翔”，这样，“新的情境，是取之不尽的”。《红日》的艺术实践，果然证明了这一点。反党反社会主义的瞿白音张开他那“想象的翅膀”一“飞翔”，本来是我军根据毛主席的战略思想，有目的、有计划、有组织地诱敌深入、聚歼敌人的主动转移，就变成了溃败而走，狼狈而逃！本来是敌人已经山穷水尽、土崩瓦解、悲观绝望、束手待擒，却变成了机动灵活、坚定沉着、泰然自若、临危不惧！本来是该歌颂的，倒变成了被暴露的！本来是该暴露的，竟变成了被歌颂的！好一双“想象的翅膀”，好一阵奇特的“飞翔”！飞呀，飞呀，飞到了九霄云外，完全脱离人民生活这个文学艺术的唯一源泉，根本反对文艺为工农兵服务的方向。革命的现实被歪曲了，革命的历史任意伪造，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想可以不算数，凭着他资产阶级的反动本性，爱怎么骗人就怎么骗人，爱骂谁就骂谁，一切随心所欲，这就是“想象的翅膀”的妙用，这就是“新的情境”的目的。这和反革命分子胡风的“自我拥抱”、“自我扩张”、“主观战斗精神”一模一样。从这里，我们也看穿了瞿白音提倡“新的艺术构思”的“秘密”。原来他说什么“想象的翅膀被束缚了吗？被挫伤了吗？被折断了吗？还没有长出来吗？根本没有吗？束缚了的要解放，挫伤了的要医治；折断了的要接肢，没长出来的养之育之，根本没有的……，干不需要想象的工作是否会适合些呢？”就是在煽风点火，呼唤文艺界里那些“被束缚了”的、“被挫伤了”的、“被折断了”的牛鬼蛇神魑魅魍魉赶快出笼，就是要把坚持毛泽东文艺路线的革命文艺工作者，赶出文艺阵地，就是要篡夺无产阶级在文艺领域内的领导权！这难道是什么新的理论吗？不！这是资产阶级文艺家一直就在做着的反革命复辟的迷梦。
    透过瞿白音的艺术实践来看他的文艺主张，《关于电影创新问题的独白》提出的“创新”口号和“创‘一代之新’的作品”的“三要素”，系统而完整地表明了瞿白音的理论的反动性。那就是：用反党反社会主义的“新的思想”来反对毛泽东思想，用地富反坏右的“新的形象”来排挤工农兵的形象，用资产阶级的“新的艺术构思”让牛鬼蛇神魑魅魍魉来占领无产阶级的文艺阵地，进行资产阶级的反革命的复辟。他的理论《关于电影创新问题的独白》，是不折不扣的现代修正主义的电影纲领；而他的创作《红日》，则是现代修正主义电影的一个艺术标本！
    瞿白音从一股黑弦上射出了两支毒箭
    瞿白音的创作和理论的产生，不是偶然的和孤立的现象，是现代修正主义文艺和所谓三十年代文艺相结合的混血儿，是资产阶级和无产阶级两个阶级、两条道路、两种思想的斗争在文艺领域中的表现。
    瞿白音的创作和理论，是现代修正主义文艺的翻版。
    一九六二年前后，正当瞿白音进行他的创作实践和理论探索的时候，国际现代修正主义的思潮正在泛滥。丘赫莱依、格拉西莫夫、罗姆之流的现代修正主义电影“大师”，一再宣扬：“坚决反对一切明文规定的不可更改的艺术立场”，“创造文学的是才华横溢的人，而不是什么‘主义者’和‘主义’”。现代修正主义电影的毒草，诸如：《一个人的命运》、《士兵之歌》、《伊凡的童年》等等，大批出笼。这股妖风，使坚持反党反社会主义立场的瞿白音十分醉心。他感到：“初春的晚风，虽然还有寒意，吹在脸上却很舒服。也吹来了万端思绪。”他质问道：“现在世界范围内正在掀起一个电影艺术创新的热潮，为什么我们就不需要创新？不能创新？”他的反动的创作和理论，是受之于现代修正主义思潮的“鬼胎”，不是很明白的吗？
    瞿白音的创作和理论，还是所谓三十年代文艺的产物。
    也正在一九六二年前后，国内文艺界一小撮资产阶级的代表人物大力鼓吹复活所谓三十年代文艺，尖厉的呼声一时甚嚣尘上。“三十年代文艺”的积极鼓吹者之一的夏衍，一九五九年就在电影界打起了“离革命经、叛战争道”的黑旗，瞿白音也声嘶力竭地称颂“三十年代是蓬勃创新的时代”，吹嘘在所谓三十年代，“具有新的思想，新的形象和新的艺术构思的作品，象澎湃春潮，涌到银幕上”，强调要“继承”所谓三十年代电影的“传统”。他的创作和理论，正是和所谓三十年代的文艺一脉相承！
    正是在现代修正主义文艺思想和所谓三十年代文艺思想兴风作浪的时候，国际上反华大合唱调门最高，蒋介石也狂妄叫嚣窜犯大陆，瞿白音迫不及待捧出了《红日》，抛出了“独白”，从一股黑弦上射出了两支毒箭。
    瞿白音的那一套黑理论是什么创新吗？根本不是。那不过是拾现代修正主义文艺的牙慧，袭所谓三十年代文艺之旧罢了！这是历史的一种反动！
    无产阶级的革命文艺工作者，决不反对创新。我们从来就提倡“标新立异”。但是，和瞿白音之流相反，我们标的是社会主义之新，立的是无产阶级之异。我们是大兴无产阶级思想，大灭资产阶级思想。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，精心地塑造工农兵英雄人物的光辉形象，努力地创作反映无产阶级革命时代精神的革命文艺作品。这种无产阶级的创新的作品，是和一切剥削阶级的意识形态彻底决裂的、开创人类历史新纪元的、最新最美最灿烂的革命文艺。在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，我们革命的文艺工作者和广大的工农兵，已经创造出不少优秀的作品。它们无论是在内容上和形式上，都划出了一个完全崭新的时代。革命现代京剧《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《智取威虎山》、《奇袭白虎团》，芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，交响音乐《沙家浜》，泥塑《收租院》，小说《欧阳海之歌》等，就是无产阶级革命文艺工作者的一部分创新的成果。瞿白音之流，打着“创新”的旗号，妄图贩卖反党反社会主义的黑货，那是决不能得逞的！
    在反党反社会主义的黑线的牵引下，影片《红日》曾经博得了一小撮人的喝采，《关于电影创新问题的独白》也曾经受到了一小撮人的吹捧。瞿白音便野心勃勃自勖“锲而不舍”、“百折不挠”；气势汹汹叫喊“创新是为了斗争。只有创新才能赢得这一场斗争的胜利”；狂吠汪汪辱骂我们是“蚂蚁”、“跛驴”，说什么“蚂蚁怪怨飞龙不循台阶往上爬，一抬身便直上云霄；跛驴怪骏马不步步走，一抬腿便迈出千里。”向我们提出了挑战！
    现在，已经是到了取缔黑货，铲除毒草的时候了，我们毫不含糊地接受瞿白音和一切黑线“英雄”们的挑战。我们在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，完全有勇气，有信心，有力量彻底反掉反党反社会主义的黑线，坚决把社会主义文化大革命进行到底！历史已经并将一定会继续证明：真正的飞龙骏马，是无产阶级的革命文艺工作者！而瞿白音之流，才是真正的蚂蚁和跛驴！
