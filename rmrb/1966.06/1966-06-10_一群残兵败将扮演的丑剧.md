    A Farce Performed by a Band of Remnants and Defeated Generals
    By our commentator
    Recently, under the planning of the United States, the six countries of the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand carried out a so-called "Sea Imp" military exercise in the South China Sea. This large-scale military exercise, which lasted for nineteen days, is a blatant war threat to the people of Southeast Asian countries and a blatant challenge to the people of Vietnam and China. At the same time, it is also a farce performed by a band of remnants and defeated generals.
    The Johnson government's large-scale military exercise in the South China Sea is a step in its accelerating preparations for further expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. Recently, the United States' situation in South Vietnam has deteriorated and become extremely embarrassing. Whether it is the military situation or the political situation, it is a mess. Now that the rainy season has arrived, the Johnson government is terrified in the face of more intense attacks by the Vietnamese people. Under these circumstances, US imperialism hurriedly gathered the armies of the accomplice countries in the aggression against Vietnam to conduct what it called "realistic exercises" of "sea air strikes," "surface attacks," and long-distance "sea escorts." This is clearly an aggressive "exercise" by the United States to expand the flames of the war of aggression against Vietnam and throw more cannon fodder from accomplice countries into the South Vietnamese battlefield. By doing so, the United States and its accomplices will more seriously threaten the security of the people of Asian and Pacific countries, thereby arousing strong opposition from the people of all countries and causing the already fierce anti-American anger to burn even higher and stronger.
    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's six-nation military exercise is also aimed at China, constituting a naked threat to the Chinese people. American warships not only held this exercise in the South China Sea but also openly entered Hong Kong to provoke the Chinese people.
    US imperialism and its lackeys, you a bunch of jumping clowns, are overestimating yourselves. The aggressive military bloc controlled by the United States has long been fragmented, deserted, and opposed and surrounded by the people of Asian and countries around the world. If you continue to act unjustly, you will surely destroy yourselves.
    British imperialism, acting as a watchdog for US imperialism, blatantly colludes with US imperialism in provocative military exercises and allows American exercise ships to enter Hong Kong waters. This is an act of hostility towards the Chinese people. The British Labour government's behavior of following in the footsteps of US imperialists further exposes its wolfish ambitions. But those who play with fire will burn themselves, and the same dead end awaits British imperialists.

    一群残兵败将扮演的丑剧
    本报评论员
    最近，在美国策划下，美、英、澳、新、菲、泰六国在南中国海搞了一次所谓“海上顽童”军事演习。这次为期十九天的大规模军事演习，是对东南亚各国人民的露骨的战争威胁，是针对越南人民和中国人民的一次明目张胆的挑战，同时也是一出由残兵败将扮演的丑剧。
    约翰逊政府兴师动众，在南中国海组织军事演习，是它加紧准备进一步扩大侵越战争的一个步骤。最近一段时期，美国在越南南方的处境每况愈下、狼狈透顶。不论是军事形势，还是政治局面，都是一团糟。现在，雨季已经来临，约翰逊政府面对着越南人民更为猛烈的打击，惊恐万分。在这种情况下，美帝国主义急急忙忙纠合侵越帮凶国家的军队，搞什么“海上空袭”、“海面攻击”和长距离“海上护航”的“逼真的演习”，显然是美国扩大侵越战火、把更多帮凶国家的炮灰投入南越战场的一次侵略“演习”。美国和它的帮凶这样做，必将更加严重威胁亚洲及太平洋地区各国人民的安全，从而激起各国人民的强烈反对，并使得已经很猛烈的反美怒火烧得更高更旺。
    东南亚条约组织的六国军事演习，它的矛头也是针对中国的，是对中国人民进行赤裸裸的威胁。美国军舰不仅在南中国海举行这次演习，而且公然开进香港，对中国人民进行挑衅。
    美帝国主义及其帮凶娄罗们，你们这一群跳梁小丑，未免太不自量力了。美国控制下的侵略军事集团早已支离破碎，众叛亲离，并且遭到亚洲和世界各国人民的反对和包围。你们多行不义，必然自取灭亡。
    英帝国主义充当美帝国主义的警犬，明目张胆地伙同美帝国主义进行挑衅性军事演习，并且允许美国的演习舰只开进香港海面。这是敌视中国人民的行为。英国工党政府亦步亦趋地追随着美帝国主义者的行为，进一步暴露了它的豺狼野心，但玩火者必自焚，等待着英帝国主义者的同样是死路一条。
