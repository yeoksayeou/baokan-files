Vice Premier Chen Yi addressed the opening ceremony of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. He stated that the Asian and African peoples have entered a great era of cultural revival. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great practice of Mao Zedong Thought.

The so-called civilization and way of life promoted by American imperialism are opium that corrupts the national consciousness of the peoples of various countries and enslaves their thoughts. Modern revisionist literature has degenerated into a parrot of Western bourgeois literature, serving imperialism and the reactionary forces of various countries.

To oppose imperialism led by the United States, to strive for and safeguard national independence, and to carry the national revolution to the end is the most urgent and primary historical task of the Asian and African peoples at present. China is determined to bear the greatest national sacrifices to support the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples and the people of the world.

New China News Agency, June 27th: The full text of Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech at the opening ceremony of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers is as follows:

Chairman, distinguished representatives, friends, comrades:

The Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers opens today in Beijing. China is honored to be the host and serve your conference. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to the Asian and African writers attending the conference and express my heartfelt congratulations to the conference.

Today, representatives and observers from 47 countries and regions in Asia and Africa, as well as three international organizations, totaling 152 writers, are participating in the conference. You come from the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles in Asia and Africa and from various positions. You are a glorious and important force in the cultural army of the Asian and African peoples. For a long time, you have used your pens as weapons to fight for the cause of anti-imperialist and revolutionary unity of the Asian and African peoples. You have always used revolutionary literature and art as a weapon of criticism; in Vietnam, Congo (Leopoldville), and other regions, it has now developed into a weapon of criticism. Your names and works are not only respected by your own peoples but also by the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia and Africa.

You have come here to hold this conference despite the obstruction and sabotage by imperialism and its followers. You have brought the good news of the awakening, unity, struggle, and victory of the 2 billion people of Asia and Africa. This is a manifestation of the great unity of Asian and African writers in the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. This conference not only marks a new stage in the movement of Asian and African writers but also provides great support and encouragement to the struggling peoples of Asia and Africa and the world.

Friends, comrades! The current international situation is favorable to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world, and unfavorable to imperialism and old and new colonialism. The peoples of Asia and Africa want to be anti-imperialist, independent, and free. The peoples of Asia and Africa have awakened more than ever before, their strength is growing, and their struggles are deepening. This is the mainstream of the situation in Asia and Africa. Imperialism led by the United States and a handful of reactionaries, using direct aggression, brutal interference, political subversion, and other means, are launching a counter-revolutionary tide to frenziedly counterattack the revolutionary forces. However, this will not stop the victorious advance of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa.

American imperialism is becoming more aggressive in its control, interference, subversion, and aggression in the Asia and Africa regions. It persists in pursuing a policy of aggression and war worldwide. It is the most arrogant invader in history, the main pillar of all reactionary forces in the world, and the most vicious enemy of all the peoples of the world. In the struggle for independence and progress, the peoples of Asia and Africa must engage in life-and-death, head-on struggles with American imperialism at every step forward.

The Soviet revisionists, seeking to dominate the world through US-Soviet cooperation, help American imperialism and its running dogs maintain reactionary rule, suppress national liberation movements, and disintegrate and sabotage the united front of Asian and African anti-imperialist forces. They have degenerated into accomplices of American imperialism. While opposing imperialism led by the United States, the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa cannot but also oppose modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership.

To oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, to strive for and safeguard national independence, and to carry the national revolution to the end is the most urgent and primary historical task of the Asian and African peoples at present.

The peoples of the not-yet-independent countries in Asia and Africa are taking various forms of struggle, including armed struggle, to strive for independence and liberation.

The peoples of the already-independent countries in Asia and Africa, to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty, to develop national economies and national cultures, and to continue to struggle against the control, interference, subversion, and aggression of imperialism and old and new colonialism.

The Chinese people share the same breath and fate with the peoples of various countries in Asia and Africa. We will always stand with our anti-imperialist revolutionary brothers in Asia and Africa.

We firmly support the just struggles of the peoples of Vietnam, Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaya, the Philippines, North Kalimantan, Indonesia, Japan, and other countries; we firmly support the struggles of the peoples of Asia to oppose imperialist aggression and strive for and safeguard national independence.

We firmly support the just struggles of the peoples of South Yemen, Oman, and Palestine; we firmly support the struggles of the Arab peoples to strive for and safeguard national independence and oppose imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel.

We firmly support the just struggles of the peoples of Congo (Leopoldville), Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Bechuanaland, Basutoland, Swaziland, South West Africa, French Somaliland, the Comoros Islands, and the Canary Islands; we firmly support the struggles of the peoples of Africa to oppose old and new colonialism and strive for and safeguard national independence.

We firmly support the efforts of the newly independent countries in Asia and Africa to develop national economies and build their countries, and we will, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, do our utmost to help them achieve economic self-reliance and break free from imperialist control.

We are determined to bear the greatest national sacrifices to support the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world. No matter what pressure the imperialism led by the United States exerts on us to force us to change our policies, we will adhere to our stance of opposing imperialism and supporting the anti-imperialist revolution of all peoples, and we will not waver or change.

The Vietnamese issue is the current focus of the international anti-American struggle. The American aggressors are carrying out a policy of total annihilation in South Vietnam with unprecedented barbaric and inhuman methods, and they are bombing North Vietnam indiscriminately. However, all this cannot change the inevitable fate of the failure of American imperialism. To save the situation, it is using the threat of escalating the war to push for peace talks, while at the same time using the smoke screen of peace talks to cover up the crime of escalating the war, in an attempt to achieve the goal of permanently occupying South Vietnam and permanently dividing Vietnam.

The heroic Vietnamese people have fully demonstrated the power of people's war and achieved brilliant victories in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. The Vietnamese people have long been determined to defend the north, liberate the south, and reunify the country, driving out the American aggressors. The Vietnamese issue can only be resolved according to the will of the Vietnamese people. The United States must stop its aggression against the entire Vietnam and withdraw all its armed forces from South Vietnam, allowing the Vietnamese people to solve their own problems. Otherwise, all talk about a peaceful solution to the Vietnamese issue will be nothing but a fraud.

The Soviet leadership is advocating that the United States also has the intention to peacefully resolve the Vietnamese issue, attempting to lower the just demands of the Vietnamese people and to betray the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people, making the just struggle of the Vietnamese people half-hearted. This is unacceptable. Unprincipled compromise will only give American imperialism a chance to breathe, while bringing greater disasters to the Vietnamese people. Under such circumstances, how can we talk about carrying out any "joint actions" with it?

The Vietnamese people are at the forefront of the struggle of all the peoples of the world against American imperialism. Every drop of blood shed by the Vietnamese people is for the struggle for their own national independence and for the common cause of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism of the Asian and African peoples. To the greatest extent possible, support the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation, and to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors, is the common internationalist duty of the Asian and African peoples.

We, the Chinese people, no matter what tricks the American imperialists play, no matter how high they escalate the war, and no matter what risks we have to take and what sacrifices we have to make, we will fully support the Vietnamese people until their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation achieves final victory.

To the greatest extent possible, isolate and strike at American imperialism, the peoples of Asia and Africa and all the peoples of the world must further expand and strengthen the international united front against American imperialism and its running dogs. This united front should adhere to the truly revolutionary line that reflects the wishes of all the peoples of the world. This united front should be based on the great unity of all the revolutionary peoples of the world. This united front should include all the countries and peoples who are subjected to aggression, interference, control, and bullying by American imperialism, but it must not include the running dogs, accomplices, and co-conspirators of American imperialism.

In our era, it is not the strength of imperialism that is great, but the strength of the revolutionary peoples that is great; it is not the revolutionary peoples who fear imperialism, but imperialism that fears the revolutionary peoples. The peoples of Asia and Africa are not afraid of imperialism and old and new colonialism. Relying on armed struggle and the anti-American united front, they will surely be able to defeat American imperialism and achieve victory in the cause of national liberation. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "All the peoples of the world must have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, fear no difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All demons will be exterminated."

Friends, comrades! With the continuous development and victory of the national liberation movement, the peoples of Asia and Africa have entered a great era of cultural revival. To establish a new culture and literature of the anti-imperialist revolution, the people, and the nation in each country of Asia and Africa, and to build Asia and Africa into a new Asia and a new Africa with modern science and culture, is the historical mission of the peoples of each country in Asia and Africa in the cultural field.

To accomplish this historical mission, the peoples of Asia and Africa are making tremendous efforts to completely eliminate all cultural and literary influences of imperialism and old and new colonialism. This influence mainly comes from American imperialism.

Since the end of the Second World War, American imperialism has spent hundreds of millions of dollars and mobilized all its propaganda machines to promote so-called American civilization and way of life through various channels and in various forms of literature and art. American literature and art are extremely reactionary, decadent, and doomed, and are also a manifestation of despair. They are opium that corrupts the national consciousness of the peoples of various countries and enslaves their thoughts. Their purpose is to use cultural infiltration to supplement their political subversion, economic plunder, and military aggression. In the United States, any progressive literature and art cannot emerge and are suppressed.

Modern revisionist literature has degenerated into a parrot of Western bourgeois literature, serving imperialism and the reactionary forces of various countries.

The new culture and literature of the peoples of Asia and Africa have developed in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. This new culture and literature are the most progressive, most full of vitality, and most in line with the urgent needs of the peoples of Asia and Africa and the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle.

The new culture and literature of the peoples of Asia and Africa strongly reflect the great spirit of the current anti-imperialist revolutionary era, clearly establish national characteristics, and are closely connected with the masses of the people. Therefore, our new culture and literature are an integral part of the entire anti-imperialist revolutionary machine, a powerful weapon for uniting and educating the people and striking and eliminating the forces of imperialism, and for striving for independence and liberation.

The peoples of Asia and Africa have created brilliant and splendid ancient cultures and made great contributions to human history. Now, the peoples of Asia and Africa are re-emerging on the stage of world history with a revolutionary and advanced attitude as masters. The era in which the peoples of Asia and Africa were looked down upon, and our Asian and African cultures were looked down upon in modern world history, should be over. With the victory and development of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa, the great new culture of the peoples of Asia and Africa is rising. In terms of ideological content, this new culture has already far surpassed the entire old culture of imperialism and colonialism.

When Western imperialist culture is increasingly decadent and desperate, and modern revisionist culture is increasingly degenerate, the hardworking, brave, wise, and highly nationalistic and self-confident peoples of Asia and Africa will surely be able to make greater contributions to human civilization than in the past.

Friends, comrades! Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are firmly adhering to the general line of building socialism with great, daring, and pioneering spirit, leaping forward in all aspects, and making rapid progress. Our industrial production has not only increased in quantity but, more importantly, has made new leaps in variety, quality, and technology. The scale, speed, and quality of our basic construction have far surpassed the previous few years. Agriculture has had good harvests for four consecutive years. The entire national economy has presented an unprecedented and comprehensive upsurge.

In the past few months, our people have launched an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. This is a great revolutionary movement to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and advance the cause of socialism in our country. This great revolution is the inevitable result of the development of our country's history.

The task of this proletarian cultural revolution is to thoroughly eliminate all the poisonous influences of the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits created by all exploiting classes over thousands of years, and to create and form new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat among the broad masses of the people. It is to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the great waves of class struggle, to popularize Mao Zedong Thought, and to closely combine Mao Zedong Thought with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The target of this proletarian cultural revolution is to concentrate our forces to strike at those few percent of the population who are die-hard counter-revolutionaries opposing the Communist Party and socialism. For the vast majority, we have been, are, and will continue to adhere to the policy of unity-criticism-unity. For the broad masses of intellectuals from the old society, we continue to adhere to the policy of unity, education, and transformation, and this policy is unshakable. Some domestic and foreign reactionaries slander us for directing the struggle at all intellectuals, which is purely malicious nonsense.

In this proletarian cultural revolution, we rely on the resolute revolutionary cadres, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, and the broad masses of revolutionary intellectuals. The hundreds of millions of broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country, through studying Chairman Mao's works, have opened the door to Marxism-Leninism theory, and the era in which a few intellectuals monopolized theory and knowledge has gone forever. The new era of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasping theory and knowledge has arrived! Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, a large number of literary and art workers from among workers, peasants, and soldiers have emerged. They have completely freed themselves from the shackles of old exploitative class literary and art thought and created a large number of literary and art works with a revolutionary spirit of the socialist era. The facts vividly prove that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, it will turn into a great material force.

A few imperialist elements and their followers, seeing us launching a great cultural revolution, think that there is something wrong with our country and government, as if they can gain something from it. They want to take advantage of the situation. These gentlemen are more stupid than pigs. The Communist Party of China dares to mobilize the masses to launch a great cultural revolution, which precisely shows that our country is strong, our government is stable, and our people are united. Isn't that clear?

More importantly, this cultural revolution is precisely to uproot the social base of imperialism and modern revisionism, to prevent revisionism from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state, and to prevent the restoration of capitalism. This is Comrade Mao Zedong's great development of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, we can confidently tell our friends that this unprecedented cultural revolution of ours is indeed a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary forces of various countries. Apart from disappointment, they will not be able to obtain anything else. Let us ask, do American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism dare to launch a cultural revolution like China's at home? I can confidently say that they dare not!

The victory of this cultural revolution will further consolidate our proletarian dictatorship, ensure that the Chinese people carry the socialist revolution to the end, ensure that our socialist construction can proceed smoothly, and prepare the conditions for the future realization of communism. In this way, the one-fourth of the world's population in China will be able to make greater and more internationalist contributions to the progressive cause of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world.

Friends, comrades!

The cultural revolution currently being carried out by our people is a great practice of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the compass that guides this cultural revolution.

Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism creatively developed in the long-term practice of the Chinese revolution; it is Marxism-Leninism creatively developed in the great struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary forces of various countries. Mao Zedong Thought is the sole guide for the Chinese people to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it is also a powerful weapon for the Chinese people to defeat imperialism and modern revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism.

Friends, comrades, you must understand that the Chinese people, who have suffered deep disasters, have achieved today's victory after a hundred and nine years of struggle. To achieve today's victory, we have gone through a tortuous, complex, and arduous process of struggle, failure, struggle again, failure again, struggle again, until victory. To remove the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism that have been pressing down on the Chinese people, many people have sought various kinds of thoughts, sought various kinds of methods, and walked various kinds of roads. We have traveled all over the world, seeking a way to relieve our suffering, but no thought worked, and no road was passable. The facts have educated the Chinese people that, apart from believing in Mao Zedong Thought, there is nothing else to believe in. Summarizing the experience of our country's several decades of revolutionary struggle, especially the long-term experience of bloodshed and failure, it comes down to this: only Mao Zedong Thought can save China, and without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no new China. We have believed in various thoughts and tried various systems, but all have failed. We believed in Marxism-Leninism combined with Chinese revolutionary practice, Mao Zedong Thought, and we won. The Chinese people have deeply understood from their own experience that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, and Chairman Mao's words are the highest directive for all our work.

Now, with the deepening development of the struggle against American imperialism and old and new colonialism, more and more people around the world, especially in the Asia, Africa, and Latin America regions, want to study Mao Zedong Thought. Friends who want to learn, we welcome this with great enthusiasm and regard this desire as encouragement and inspiration to the Chinese people.

The Chinese people will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, learn more humbly from the revolutionary peoples of the world, especially learn from the fighting and heroic peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Chinese people thank the peoples of various countries in Asia and Africa for their support and assistance. The revolutionary peoples of the world who are on the front lines of the struggle are all our teachers, and we are willing to be their students. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people will, together with the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world, contribute their greatest strength to opposing imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary forces of various countries, and to supporting the just struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples.

Friends, comrades! Imperialism and its followers are unhappy about this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers and hate anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist literature and art in Asia and Africa. Your holding this conference here is a great victory for the friendly unity of Asian and African writers. Through your efforts, this conference will definitely make new contributions to promoting the revolutionary unity of Asian and African writers. At the same time, I believe that through everyone's efforts, the revolutionary literature and art of Asia and Africa against imperialism and colonialism will definitely have new developments and play a greater role in the sublime cause of the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa against imperialism. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I wish this conference a complete success!

Long live the great unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa!
Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!
The peoples of Asia and Africa will surely win!
Imperialism and old and new colonialism will surely fail!

    陈毅副总理在亚非作家紧急会议开幕式上致词
    亚非人民已经进入了文化复兴伟大时代
    中国文化大革命是毛泽东思想伟大实践
    美帝国主义所宣扬的文明和生活方式，是腐蚀各国人民的民族意识、奴化各国人民思想的鸦片；现代修正主义文艺堕落成了西方资产阶级文艺的应声虫，为帝国主义和各国反动派效劳。
    反对以美国为首的帝国主义，争取和维护民族独立，把民族革命进行到底，是亚非人民当前最迫切最主要的历史任务，中国决心为支持亚非人民和世界人民反帝革命事业而承担最大的民族牺牲。
    新华社二十七日讯　陈毅副总理在亚非作家紧急会议开幕式上的致词。全文如下：主席，各位代表先生，朋友们，同志们：
    亚非作家紧急会议今天在北京开幕了。中国能够作为东道主，为你们的会议服务，感到十分荣幸。我代表中国政府和中国人民，向出席会议的亚非作家们表示热烈的欢迎，向会议表示衷心的祝贺。
    今天，参加会议的有亚非四十七个国家和地区以及三个国际组织的一百五十二位作家代表和观察员。你们来自亚非反帝反殖斗争的最前线和各个不同的岗位。你们是亚非人民文化大军中的一支光荣的、重要的队伍。长期以来，你们用自己的笔杆子作为武器，为亚非人民反帝革命团结的事业而战斗。你们一向用反帝的、革命的文艺作为批判的武器；在越南、刚果（利）等地区，现在已经发展为武器的批判。你们的名字和作品不仅受到你们本国人民的尊敬，而且受到中国人民和亚非人民的尊敬。
    你们这次不顾帝国主义及其追随者的阻挠和破坏，来到这里开会。你们带来了亚非二十亿人民觉醒、团结、战斗、胜利的新喜讯。这是亚非作家反帝革命大团结的表现。这次会议不仅标志着亚非作家运动的一个崭新阶段，而且对于战斗中的亚非人民和世界人民也是极大的支持和鼓舞。
    朋友们，同志们！目前的国际形势，有利于亚非和世界人民，而不利于帝国主义和新老殖民主义。亚非人民要反帝，要独立，要自由。亚非人民空前觉醒，力量日益壮大，斗争更加深入。这是亚非形势的主流。以美国为首的帝国主义和一小撮反动派，使用直接侵略、横暴干涉和政治颠覆等等手段，向革命力量疯狂反扑，掀起一股反革命逆流。但是，这决不能阻挡亚非革命人民的胜利前进。
    美帝国主义在亚非地区变本加厉地进行控制、干涉、颠覆和侵略，在全世界坚持推行侵略政策和战争政策。它是有史以来最狂妄的侵略者，是世界上一切反动势力的最主要的支柱，是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。亚非人民在争取独立和进步的道路上，每前进一步都不能不同美帝国主义进行殊死的、针锋相对的斗争。
    苏联修正主义者一心谋求美苏合作主宰世界，帮助美帝国主义及其走狗维持反动统治，镇压民族解放运动，瓦解和破坏亚非团结反帝的队伍。他们已经堕落成为美帝国主义的帮凶。亚非革命人民在反对以美国为首的帝国主义的同时，不能不反对以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。
    反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立，把民族革命进行到底，是亚非人民当前最迫切、最主要的历史任务。
    未独立的亚非国家的人民正在采取各种斗争方式，包括武装斗争方式在内，争取独立和解放。
    已经独立的亚非国家的人民为了维护民族独立和国家主权，发展民族经济和民族文化，继续进行着反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的控制、干涉、颠覆和侵略。
    中国人民同亚非各国人民是同呼吸共命运的。我们永远同反帝革命的亚非兄弟们站在一起。
    我们坚决支持越南、朝鲜、柬埔寨、老挝、泰国、马来亚、菲律宾、北加里曼丹、印度尼西亚、日本等国人民的正义斗争；坚决支持亚洲各国人民反对帝国主义侵略、争取和维护民族独立的斗争。
    我们坚决支持南也门、阿曼、巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的正义斗争；坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争。
    我们坚决支持刚果（利）、安哥拉、莫三鼻给、葡属几内亚、津巴布韦、南非、贝专纳、巴苏陀兰、斯威士兰、西南非洲、法属索马里、科摩罗群岛和加那利群岛等国人民的正义斗争；坚决支持非洲各国人民反对新老殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争。
    我们坚决支持亚非新兴独立国家发展民族经济、建设国家的努力，并且在平等互利的基础上，尽我们最大的能力，帮助它们在经济上自力更生，摆脱帝国主义的控制。
    我们有决心为支持亚非人民和世界人民的反帝革命事业，而承担最大的民族牺牲。不管以美国为首的帝国主义对我们施加什么压力来迫使我们改变政策，我们都将坚持自己反对帝国主义，支持各国人民反帝革命的立场，决不动摇，决不改变。
    越南问题是当前国际反美斗争的焦点。美国侵略者以空前野蛮的血腥手段，在越南南方推行灭绝人性的烧光、杀光、毁光的三光政策，在越南北方进行狂轰滥炸。但是，这一切都不能改变美帝国主义必然失败的命运。它为了挽救败局，一面用扩大战争的讹诈来推行和谈阴谋，一面又用和谈烟幕来掩盖扩大战争的罪行，妄图达到永远霸占南越、永久分裂越南的目的。
    英雄的越南人民高度发挥了人民战争的威力，在抗美救国斗争中取得了辉煌胜利。越南人民早已下定决心，保卫北方，解放南方，统一祖国，彻底赶走美国强盗。越南问题只能按照越南人民的意志解决。美国必须停止对整个越南的侵略，从南越撤出它的一切武装力量，让越南人民自己解决自己的问题。否则，一切关于和平解决越南问题的空谈，都只能是一个骗局。
    苏联领导集团鼓吹什么美国也有和平解决越南问题的诚意，力图降低越南人民的正义要求，妄图出卖越南人民的根本利益，使越南人民的正义斗争半途而废。这是决不能允许的。无原则的妥协，只能给美帝国主义以喘息的机会，而给越南人民带来更大的灾难。在这种情况之下，怎么谈得上同它搞什么“联合行动”呢？
    越南人民站在全世界人民反对美帝国主义斗争的最前线。越南人民的每一滴鲜血都是为着争取自己的民族独立，为着亚非人民反帝反殖的共同事业而流的。尽一切可能支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，彻底打败美国侵略者，是亚非人民的共同的国际主义义务。
    我们中国人民，不管美帝国主义耍什么花招，把战争升到哪一级，也不管要冒多大的风险，付出多大的代价，都将全力支持越南人民，直到他们的抗美救国斗争取得最后胜利。
    为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，亚非人民和全世界人民必须进一步扩大和加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线。这个统一战线应当坚持反映全世界人民愿望的真正革命的方针。这个统一战线应当以全世界革命人民的大团结为基础。这个统一战线应当包括一切受到美帝国主义侵略、干涉、控制和欺负的国家和人民，但是绝不能包括美帝国主义的走狗、帮凶和同谋者。
    在我们这个时代，不是帝国主义的力量强大，而是革命人民的力量强大；不是革命人民害怕帝国主义，而是帝国主义害怕革命人民。亚非人民，不怕帝国主义和新老殖民主义，依靠武装斗争和反美统一战线，就一定能够打败美帝国主义，赢得民族解放事业的胜利。正如毛泽东同志指出的：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    朋友们，同志们！随着民族解放运动的不断发展和胜利，亚非人民已经进入了文化复兴的伟大时代。建立亚非各国的反帝革命的、人民大众的、民族的新文化，把亚洲和非洲建设成为具有现代科学文化的新亚洲和新非洲，这是亚非各国人民在文化方面的历史使命。
    为了完成这个历史使命，亚非人民正在进行巨大的努力，要把帝国主义和新老殖民主义的一切文化和文艺影响铲除干净。这种影响主要来自美帝国主义。
    自从第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义耗费了亿万美元，开动了全部宣传机器，通过各种途径，利用各种文艺形式，宣扬所谓美国文明和生活方式。美国的这种文学艺术是极端反动的、腐朽的、没落的，也是绝望的表现。它是腐蚀各国人民的民族意识、奴化各国人民思想的鸦片。它的目的是要用文化渗透来补充它的政治颠覆、经济掠夺和军事侵略。在美国国内任何进步的文艺都不能冒头，都遭到镇压。
    现代修正主义文艺堕落成了西方资产阶级文艺的应声虫，为帝国主义和各国反动派效劳。
    亚非人民的新文化和新文艺是在反帝革命斗争中发展起来的，是在同帝国主义和新老殖民主义的反动文化和反动文艺的斗争中发展起来的。这种新文化和新文艺是最进步的，最富有生命力的、最符合亚非人民的利益和反帝革命斗争的迫切需要的。
    亚非人民的新文化和新文艺强烈地反映了当前伟大的反帝革命的时代精神，鲜明地树立了民族特色，并且密切地同人民大众相结合。因此，我们的这种新文化和新文艺是整个反帝革命机器的一部分，是团结和教育人民、打击和消灭帝国主义势力、争取独立和解放的有力武器。
    亚非人民曾经创造过辉煌灿烂的古老文化，对人类的历史作出过伟大的贡献。现在，亚非人民正以革命的、先进的主人翁的身份，重新出现在世界历史的舞台上。近代世界历史上那种看不起我们亚非人民，看不起我们亚非文化的时代，应当完结了。随着亚非人民的反帝革命斗争的胜利发展，伟大的亚非人民的新文化正在兴起。这种新文化，就其思想内容来说，已经远远超过了整个帝国主义和殖民主义的旧文化。
    当西方帝国主义文化日益腐朽、绝望，修正主义文化日益堕落的时候，勤劳、勇敢、智慧的、具有高度民族自尊和民族自信的亚非人民，一定能够对全人类的文明作出比过去更加伟大的贡献。
    朋友们，同志们！中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，坚持鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，正在社会主义的道路上大踏步地向前迈进。我国的工业生产不仅在数量上，更重要的是在品种上、质量上和技术上有了新的跃进。基本建设的规模、速度和质量都大大超过了前几年。农业连续四年获得了好的收成。整个国民经济出现了一个空前未有的全面高涨的局面。
    最近几个月来，我国人民开展了一个史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动。这是我国巩固无产阶级专政、推进社会主义事业的一个伟大的革命运动。这场大革命是我国历史发展的必然结果。
    我们这场无产阶级文化大革命的任务，就是要彻底破除几千年来一切剥削阶级所造成的毒害人民的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，在广大人民群众中，创造和形成崭新的无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。就是要在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，活学活用毛泽东思想，普及毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想同广大工农兵群众密切地结合起来。
    我们这场无产阶级文化大革命的斗争矛头，就是要集中力量，打击那些只占全人口百分之几的一小撮死心塌地反对共产党、反对社会主义的反革命分子。对绝大多数人，我们过去是、现在是、将来也仍然是采取团结——批评——团结的政策。对于从旧社会来的广大知识分子，我们继续采取团结、教育、改造的方针，这个方针是坚定不移的。国内外的一些反动派诬蔑我们把斗争矛头“针对所有知识分子”，这纯属别有用心的胡说八道。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们依靠坚定的无产阶级革命派，依靠广大工农兵群众、广大的革命干部和广大的革命知识分子。我国亿万的广大工农兵群众，由于大学毛主席著作，闯开了马克思列宁主义理论的大门，少数知识分子垄断理论和知识的时代将一去不复返了，工农兵群众直接掌握理论和知识的新的历史时代已经来到！在毛泽东思想的指引下，工农兵文艺工作者大量涌现。他们从旧的剥削阶级的文艺思想的束缚下，彻底解放出来，创造出大量的具有社会主义时代的革命气息的文艺作品。事实生动地证明，毛泽东思想一经被广大工农兵所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。
    一小撮帝国主义分子及其追随者，看到我们大搞文化革命，就以为我们的国家和政权出了什么问题，似乎可以从中捞到什么好处，他们企图从中捞一把。这些老爷们比猪还要愚蠢。中国共产党敢于放手发动群众，大搞文化革命，这恰恰是表明：我们的国家是强大的，我们的政权是巩固的，我们全国人民是团结的。这难道还不清楚吗？
    更重要的是，这场文化大革命，正是要挖掉帝国主义和现代修正主义的社会基础，防止修正主义篡夺党和国家的领导，防止资本主义复辟。这是毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展。因此，可以肯定地告诉朋友们，我们这场前所未有的文化大革命，对于帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，确实是一个极其沉重的打击。除了失望之外，他们决不可能得到其他的任何东西。我们问一问，美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义，敢不敢象中国这样在国内搞一场文化大革命呢？我可以肯定地说，他们不敢！
    这场文化大革命的胜利，将进一步巩固我国的无产阶级专政，保证中国人民把社会主义革命进行到底，保证我国的社会主义建设能够顺利进行，并且为将来实现共产主义准备条件。这样，占世界人口四分之一的中国人民，对亚非人民和世界人民的进步事业，也就可能作出更多、更大的国际主义的支援和贡献。
    朋友们，同志们！
    我国人民目前正在进行着的文化大革命，是毛泽东思想的伟大实践。毛泽东思想是指导这场文化大革命的方向盘。
    毛泽东思想是在中国革命的长期实践中创造性地发展了的马克思列宁主义；是在中国人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的伟大斗争中，创造性地发展了的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是中国人民进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的唯一指针，也是中国人民战胜帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大武器。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。
    朋友们，同志们，你们一定理解，灾难深重的中国人民取得今天的胜利，是经过一百零九年的斗争的。能取得今天的胜利是经过斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利这样曲折、复杂和艰苦的历程的。为了搬掉压在中国人民头上的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山，不少人曾经寻找过各种各样的思想，寻找各种各样的办法，走过各种各样的道路。我们曾经走遍全世界，寻找一个解除苦难的方法，但是，什么思想都不灵，什么道路都不通。事实教育了中国人民，除了相信毛泽东思想外，再也不能相信别的什么思想。总结我国几十年来的革命斗争经验，特别是长期流血，遭致失败的经验，集中到一点就是，只有毛泽东思想才能救中国，没有毛泽东思想，就没有新中国。我们相信过各种思想，试验过各种制度，都失败了，我们相信了马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想，我们就胜利了。中国人民从切身的经验中深深地懂得，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，毛主席的话是我们一切工作的最高指示。
    现在，随着反对美帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义的斗争的深入发展，在世界各地，特别是在亚非拉地区，越来越多的人们要研究毛泽东思想。朋友们愿意学习，我们对此表示热烈欢迎，并且把这种愿望看作是对于中国人民的鼓舞和鞭策。
    中国人民一定要遵循毛主席的教导，更加虚心地向全世界革命人民学习，特别是要向战斗的、英雄的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民学习。中国人民感谢亚非各国人民对我们的支持和援助。站在斗争前线的全世界革命的人民，都是我们的老师，我们愿意做他们的学生。中国人民在毛泽东思想的指引下，将同亚非人民和全世界人民一道，为反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，为支援一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的正义斗争，贡献出自己最大的力量。
    朋友们，同志们！帝国主义及其追随者对于这次亚非作家紧急会议是不高兴的，对于亚非反帝反殖的文艺是痛恨的。你们在这里开会，这就是亚非作家友好团结的一个重大胜利。通过你们的努力，这次会议一定能够在促进亚非作家的革命团结方面作出新的贡献。同时，我相信，经过大家的努力，亚非反帝反殖的革命文艺一定会有一个新的发展，在亚非人民团结反帝的崇高事业中，发挥更大的战斗作用。我代表中国政府和中国人民祝这次会议的圆满成功！
    亚非人民大团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    亚非人民必胜！
    帝国主义和新老殖民主义必败！
