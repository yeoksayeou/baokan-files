    I was extremely happy and excited when I heard on the radio the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on reforming the college entrance examination system. I resolutely support this brilliant decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and under the guidance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, I will contribute all my strength to thoroughly carry out the Cultural Revolution and thoroughly reform the education system.
    The old bourgeois education system, including the enrollment examination system, must be thoroughly reformed. Because the old enrollment examination system does not put proletarian politics in command, does not serve proletarian politics, but puts bourgeois politics in command and serves bourgeois politics. This system has greatly hindered the ideological revolutionization of young people. It encourages young people to take the bourgeois path of individual struggle, pursuing personal fame and gain, and becoming "white experts". This system is a tool for a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated our education circles to implement bourgeois dictatorship over the children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. For a long time, they have used this as a weapon to fight against the proletariat, compete with the proletariat for the younger generation, and cultivate successors for the bourgeoisie.
    In the course of several years of study, I have suffered greatly from this kind of bourgeois dictatorship. I was originally a young man with revolutionary ideals. However, under this education system, my aspiration to learn more skills to serve the people and to work better for the Party in the future has been seriously hindered. I had to give up or reduce some of my work in the Youth League, had to give up studying Chairman Mao's works, and give up ideological remoulding, and instead devote all my energy and time to mechanically memorizing the dead dogma admired by those bourgeois scholars and professors. In this way, although I was admitted to Peking University, my revolutionary will suffered a serious setback.
    After being admitted to the Department of Philosophy at Peking University, I wanted to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's philosophical works and become a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, serving the people wholeheartedly. However, because Peking University, under the control of the Lu Ping anti-Party black gang, stubbornly implemented the bourgeois revisionist education line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, it did not allow us to study Chairman Mao's works at all. The curriculum did not include the course "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Under the pressure of the revolutionary masses, they sometimes talked a little about Chairman Mao's works, but the anti-Party black gang members tried every means to castrate the essence of Mao Zedong Thought, wantonly distort and attack Mao Zedong Thought, and forcibly stuff their erroneous and reactionary views into us; during the examination, they used their erroneous views as the grading standard. For example, a black gang member who taught us philosophy openly threatened us on the eve of the examination: "No matter how correct your views are, you must first answer what I taught, and then answer yours. Otherwise, you will not get a grade of 5." This is how they blatantly suppressed our study of Mao Zedong Thought. In the first two years of my study in the Department of Philosophy at Peking University, I did not truly study Chairman Mao's works, but spent most of my time studying psychology full of revisionist toxins, and those stinky and lengthy logic, as well as foreign languages, mathematics, biology, physics, Chinese, and so on. Because I failed the exams in foreign languages, psychology, and mathematics, I spent three entire vacations catching up and could not participate in other revolutionary activities.
    Under the rule of this cruel bourgeois dictatorship, under the high pressure of grades being in command, I suffered a lot of mental torment, and my body also broke down. This reactionary system must be thoroughly reformed!

### 彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度

    彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度
    我从广播里听到党中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招考办法的决定，感到万分的高兴和激动。我坚决拥护党中央和国务院这一英明决定，并在党中央和毛主席的教导下，为彻底搞好文化革命，彻底改革教育制度贡献自己的一切力量。
    旧的资产阶级教育制度包括招生考试制度，必须彻底改革。因为旧的招生考试制度不是无产阶级政治挂帅，不是为无产阶级政治服务，而是资产阶级政治挂帅，为资产阶级政治服务的。这个制度大大阻碍了青年的思想革命化。它鼓励青年走资产阶级个人奋斗，追求个人名利地位的白专道路。这个制度，是钻进我们教育界的一小撮反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物对工人、贫下中农子女实行资产阶级专政的工具。长期以来，他们以此为武器同无产阶级进行斗争，同无产阶级争夺青年一代，培养资产阶级的接班人。
    在几年的学习过程中，我吃尽了这种资产阶级专政的苦头。我本是一个有革命理想的青年。但在这种教育制度下，多学一些为人民服务的本领，将来更好地为党工作的志愿，受到严重阻碍，我不得不放弃或少做一些团的工作，不得不放弃学习毛主席著作，放弃思想改造，而把全部精力和时间都用来死背那些资产阶级学者、教授所欣赏的死教条。这样，我虽然考上了北京大学，但是我的革命意志却遭到了严重的挫折。
    考上了北大哲学系后，我本想好好学习马列主义、毛主席哲学著作，做一个毛泽东思想的宣传员，全心全意为人民服务。但是，由于北大在陆平反党黑帮的把持下，顽固地执行前北京市委的资产阶级修正主义的教育路线，根本不让我们学习毛主席著作，课程表上根本不排《毛泽东选集》这门课。在革命群众的压力下，他们有时也讲一点毛主席著作，但反党黑帮分子却千方百计地阉割毛主席思想的实质，肆意歪曲和攻击毛主席思想，硬把他们错误的、反动的观点塞给我们；考试时，又以他们的错误观点为评分标准。例如教过我们哲学课的黑帮分子曾公开在考试前夕威胁我们说：“不管你的观点多么正确，你得先把我讲的答上，然后再答你的。不这样就不能得五分。”他们就是这样明目张胆地压制我们学习毛主席思想。我在北大哲学系的头两年里，没有真正学习毛主席著作，而把绝大部分时间都用来学习那些充满修正主义毒素的心理学，和那些又臭又长的逻辑学，以及外语、数学、生物学、物理学、汉语，等等。我因外语、心理学、数学考试不及格，整整三个假期都用来补考，而不能参加其它有革命意义的活动。
    在这种残酷的资产阶级专政的统治下，在这种分数挂帅的高压下，我在精神上受到了很大的折磨，身体也垮下来了。这种反动的制度必须彻底改革！
