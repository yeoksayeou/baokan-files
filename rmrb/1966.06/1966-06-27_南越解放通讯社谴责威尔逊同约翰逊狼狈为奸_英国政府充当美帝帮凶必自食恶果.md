The South Vietnam Liberation News Agency denounces Wilson and Johnson's collaboration
British Government's Role as U.S. Imperialism's Accomplice Will Backfire

New China News Agency, Hanoi, June 26th - The South Vietnam Liberation News Agency published a commentary on the 24th, denouncing the British Labour Party government's collusion with the Johnson administration and its service to U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

The commentary pointed out that the British government has consistently served the U.S.'s dirty war of aggression. The British government sent so-called "counter-insurgency advisors" to South Vietnam to act as the U.S. military's henchmen. The British government also trained police for the Saigon puppet regime to suppress the people of South Vietnam. British Prime Minister Wilson willingly became a follower of Johnson's "unconditional discussion" deception. According to a Reuters report on June 22nd, the British government had even suggested selling bombs and rockets to the U.S., without stipulating that these bombs could not be used in Vietnam. This is yet another piece of evidence of the British Labour Party government's role as an accomplice in the U.S.'s war of aggression in Vietnam.

The commentary pointed out that it is clear that the British government's actions are a serious provocation against the Vietnamese people, the British people, and the progressive people of the world. The Vietnamese people will remember this debt, and the British people will not forgive the British Labour Party government's inhuman actions.

The commentary pointed out that the British authorities' despicable actions have been condemned by the British people and have further sharpened the contradictions within the British ruling class. If the British Labour Party government continues down this path of evil, it will eventually be tried in an international court for war crimes.

    南越解放通讯社谴责威尔逊同约翰逊狼狈为奸
    英国政府充当美帝帮凶必自食恶果
    新华社河内二十六日电  越南南方解放通讯社二十四日发表评论，谴责英国工党政府同约翰逊政府狼狈为奸，为美帝国主义侵越战争效劳。
    评论指出，英国政府一贯为美国肮脏的侵略战争效劳，英国政府把所谓反游击战“顾问”派到南越充当美军帮凶，英国政府还为西贡伪政权训练警察来镇压越南南方人民。英国首相威尔逊则甘愿充当约翰逊的“无条件讨论”骗局的追随者。据路透社六月二十二日报道，英国政府还曾建议把炸弹和火箭卖给美国，并且没有规定美国不能在越南使用这些炸弹的附带条件。这是英国工党政府在美国侵越战争中充当帮凶的又一罪证。
    评论指出，很明显，英国政府的这种行径是对越南人民、英国人民和世界进步人类的严重挑衅。越南人民将记住这笔账，英国人民将不会宽恕英国工党政府的这种丧尽天良的行动。
    评论指出，英国当局的卑鄙行径已经遭到英国人民的唾弃，并使英国统治集团内部矛盾进一步尖锐化。如果英国工党政府不顾一切地在罪恶的道路上走下去，它迟早将会在审判战争罪犯的国际法庭上受到审判。
