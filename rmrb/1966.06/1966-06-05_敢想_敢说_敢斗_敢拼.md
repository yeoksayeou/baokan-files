    Dare to Think, Dare to Speak, Dare to Struggle, Dare to Fight
    After hearing the news that seven comrades, including Nie Yuanzi from Peking University, wrote a big-character poster, we resolutely support the proletarian revolutionaries of Peking University with incomparable excitement, and support their heroic struggle against the "Three-Family Village" black gang elements Song Shuo, Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and their ilk! In the current Great Cultural Revolution, we must learn from the firm and correct proletarian stand of the seven comrades including Nie Yuanzi, and their fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to struggle, and daring to fight. Be promoters of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We must unite with the proletarian revolutionaries of Peking University and fight side by side to completely defeat the counter-revolutionary activities of the representatives of the bourgeoisie.

    敢想  敢说  敢斗  敢拼
    听到北大聂元梓等七同志写了大字报的消息以后，我们以无比激动的心情坚决支持北大的无产阶级革命派，支持他们对“三家村”黑帮分子宋硕、陆平、彭珮云之流的英勇斗争！在当前的文化大革命中，我们一定要学习聂元梓七同志坚定正确的无产阶级立场，敢想敢说敢斗敢拼的大无畏革命精神。做无产阶级文化大革命的促进派！我们一定要和北大无产阶级革命派团结一致并肩作战，彻底打败资产阶级的代表人物的反革命活动。
