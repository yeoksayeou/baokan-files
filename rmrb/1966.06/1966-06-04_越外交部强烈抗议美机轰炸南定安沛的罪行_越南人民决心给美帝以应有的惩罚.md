    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd. The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 2nd, strongly protesting the bloody crimes of American bandit aircraft in bombing Nam Dinh City and Yen Bai City again on May 31st. The scale of this attack was larger than any previous one. Various residential areas, schools, sanatoriums and some economic facilities in the city were bombed very barbarously, causing many innocent people to be injured or killed, and many houses were destroyed.
    The statement pointed out that this is a new and crazy war action by American imperialism against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. American imperialism vainly attempts to salvage their military and political failures in South Vietnam by bombing residential and economic areas in North Vietnam. However, the more they pursue their war of aggression against the Vietnamese people, the more the Vietnamese people will hate them and be more determined to defeat them. The statement severely condemned the extremely barbaric bombing crimes of American imperialism in Nam Dinh City and Yen Bai City. It also stated that the entire Vietnamese people are united as one and are determined to give the American aggressors the punishment they deserve. American imperialism is bound to suffer a shameful defeat in North and South Vietnam.

    越外交部强烈抗议美机轰炸南定安沛的罪行
    越南人民决心给美帝以应有的惩罚
    新华社河内三日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人二日发表声明，强烈抗议美国强盗飞机五月三十一日再次轰炸南定市和安沛市的血腥罪行。这次袭击的规模比以往任何一次都大。市内的各个居民区、学校、疗养院和一些经济设施遭到了非常野蛮的轰炸，使许多无辜人民伤亡、许多房屋被炸毁。
    声明指出，这是美帝国主义对越南民主共和国的新的、疯狂的战争行动。美帝国主义妄图以轰炸越南北方的居民区和经济区，来挽救他们在越南南方的军事和政治上的失败。但是，他们越是推行反对越南人民的侵略战争，越南人民也就越加仇恨他们，更加决心打败他们。声明严厉谴责美帝国主义对南定市和安沛市的极其野蛮的轰炸罪行。并表示全体越南人民万众一心，坚决给美国侵略者以应有的惩罚。美帝国主义在越南北方和南方一定要遭到可耻的失败。
