    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 22nd – The Chinese Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai visited the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bucharest Oblast on the afternoon of the 22nd, and was warmly and solemnly welcomed by all members.
    The Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative is located in Monteni-Buzău Commune, more than 80 kilometers northeast of Bucharest. In September 1952, the Monteni-Buzău Commune established an agricultural production cooperative. In October 1964, at the cooperative members' congress, it was unanimously approved to be named the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative. Since its naming, it has established friendly ties with the Sino-Romanian Friendship People's Commune in Lugouqiao, Beijing, and has made positive contributions to promoting Sino-Romanian friendship.
    Monteni-Buzău Commune was like a festival today, cleaned everywhere. From the entrance of the village to the agricultural cooperative's office, the national flags of China and Romania were hung, and arches were built with green branches and flowers, with the slogans "Welcome Distinguished Guests" and "Long Live Romanian-Chinese Friendship!" written in Romanian and Chinese.
    The members, upon hearing that Comrade Zhou Enlai was coming to visit, were all beaming with joy. They put on their most beautiful national costumes, picked the most colorful flowers, and arrived several hours early, young and old, to prepare to welcome the Chinese guests along both sides of the road. Many members said: We should do a good job in production to welcome Comrade Zhou Enlai. We want to use new production achievements to make our cooperative worthy of the name of Romanian-Chinese friendship. One member said that as soon as we heard on the radio that Comrade Zhou Enlai was coming to visit Romania, we prepared to welcome Comrade Zhou Enlai to visit us. Joe Giţă, the chairman of the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, whose father is over eighty years old, said: "Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit is a great happy event, making every one of our members feel very happy."
    At about 4 p.m., when Comrade Zhou Enlai and other comrades of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, accompanied by E. Bodnăraş, member of the Executive Committee of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee, member of the Standing Presidium of the Council of Ministers, and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and G. Niculescu, member of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee and First Secretary of the Bucharest Oblast Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, entered the village entrance, the masses of members lined up on both sides of the road immediately erupted into thunderous applause and roaring cheers, enthusiastically shouting "Long live the friendship between the Romanian and Chinese people!"
    After getting out of the car, Comrade Zhou Enlai warmly shook hands and embraced Comrade Joe Giţă, the chairman of the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, who came forward to greet him. Comrade Zhou Enlai and others also warmly shook hands with V. Mateescu, alternate member of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Bucharest Oblast People's Council, M. Argint, Chairman of the Bucharest Oblast Agricultural Cooperative Federation, and A. Voilanu, First Secretary of the Slobozia County Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. A group of girls in brightly colored national costumes ran up to present bouquets of flowers to the Chinese guests. An old member with graying temples presented Comrade Zhou Enlai with bread and salt, welcoming Comrade Zhou Enlai and other Chinese guests with the most solemn national welcoming ceremony.
    Comrade Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Comrade Joe Giţă, chairman of the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, and Comrade Con. Dănăse, secretary of the agricultural cooperative's Party committee, went to the agricultural cooperative's office and listened to Comrade Joe Giţă's introduction to the cooperative's development history and its achievements in agricultural and animal husbandry production after collectivization. Subsequently, Comrade Zhou Enlai and others visited the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative's cattle farm and the thriving wheat, corn, and sunflowers, as well as the experimental fields planted with corn seeds donated by the Sino-Romanian Friendship People's Commune in Lugouqiao, Beijing.
    Then, a grand and solemn welcoming rally with nearly 10,000 people from agricultural cooperative members from nearby communes was held at the stadium of the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative. Joe Giţă, chairman of the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, female member Yan Maria, and Comrade Zhou Enlai spoke at the meeting one after another.
    Chairman Joe Giţă first expressed a warm welcome to Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit on behalf of all members at the meeting. He said, "We have been following your visit to our country with great interest from radio, television and newspapers. These days, we have also felt the same friendship that the Romanian people expressed when you arrived in Bucharest. We know that the Chinese people also have the same enthusiasm and deep friendship towards the Romanian people."
    Chairman Giţă also described in detail the close ties between the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Sino-Romanian Friendship People's Commune in Lugouqiao, Beijing, and asked Comrade Zhou Enlai to convey their sincere fraternal friendship to the Chinese people.
    Female member Yan Maria said at the meeting, "Our entire commune is immersed in a happy atmosphere today. The residents of our commune are welcoming the distinguished guests, the envoys of the great Chinese people, with enthusiasm." She said that they were closely watching the victorious struggle of the Chinese people for building socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party. She also especially asked Comrade Zhou Enlai to convey the greetings of the women of the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative to the Chinese women.
    Comrade Zhou Enlai first thanked the members of the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative for their warm welcome and cordial reception in his speech, and conveyed the fraternal greetings of all members of the Sino-Romanian Friendship People's Commune in Lugouqiao, Beijing.
    Comrade Zhou Enlai praised the Romanian people for rapidly improving the level of agricultural production after realizing the national agricultural collectivization, relying on the superiority of the collective economy and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. Comrade Zhou Enlai said, today, we are very pleased to see the prosperous collective economy of your cooperative. We sincerely wish you continuous new and greater achievements.
    Comrade Zhou Enlai then said that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong have always attached importance to agriculture and regarded it as the foundation of the national economy. Relying on the superiority of the people's communes and with the strong support of industry, the broad masses of farmers in our country are rapidly improving agricultural production. At present, we are launching a mass movement across the country to learn from Dazhai, catch up with Dazhai, and surpass Dazhai. Now, many advanced units in the style of Dazhai have emerged across the country, which has strongly promoted the further development of agriculture in our country.
    Comrade Zhou Enlai also said: "The people of China and Romania have established a close friendship in the long-term revolutionary struggle. The friendly ties between your agricultural production cooperative and the Sino-Romanian Friendship People's Commune in Lugouqiao, Beijing, are a vivid example of this friendship between our two peoples. I believe that through our visit, the friendship between us will be further consolidated and developed." Their speeches repeatedly won warm applause and cheers from the audience.
    After the speech, G. Niculescu, member of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee and First Secretary of the Bucharest Oblast Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, presented Comrade Zhou Enlai with a picture album introducing the industrial and agricultural production and construction of the oblast. Joe Giţă, chairman of the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, also presented Comrade Zhou Enlai with gifts on behalf of all members. Comrade Zhou Enlai presented the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative with a movie projector on behalf of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation.
    On the round trip from Bucharest to the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, the Chinese Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai was warmly welcomed by tens of thousands of members and residents from dozens of villages and towns, who lined up on both sides of the road, waving the national flags of China and Romania, and saluting the Chinese guests with enthusiastic applause and cheers.

    周恩来同志率代表团访问罗中友好农业社
    罗中友好农业社社员和附近农业社社员近万人举行集会热烈欢迎中国贵宾
    在往返罗中友好农业社途中受到村镇成千上万社员和居民的夹道热烈欢迎
    新华社布加勒斯特二十二日电　由周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团，二十二日下午访问了布加勒斯特州罗中友好农业生产合作社，受到全体社员热烈隆重的欢迎。
    罗中友好农业生产合作社位于布加勒斯特东北八十余公里的蒙特尼——布泽乌乡。一九五二年九月，蒙特尼——布泽乌乡成立了农业生产合作社，一九六四年十月，在这个社的社员大会上，全体一致通过命名为罗中友好农业生产合作社。命名以来，它与北京市芦沟桥中罗友好人民公社建立了友好的联系，对促进中罗友谊作出了积极的贡献。
    蒙特尼——布泽乌乡今天象过节一样，到处都打扫得干干净净，从村口到农业社办公室的路上，悬挂着中罗两国国旗，还用绿树枝和鲜花搭成牌坊，上面用罗、中两国文字写着“欢迎贵宾”和“罗中友谊万岁！”的标语。
    社员们听说周恩来同志要前来访问，个个喜气洋洋，他们穿上自己最漂亮的民族服装，摘下最鲜艳的花朵，提前好几个小时就扶老携幼到大路两旁准备迎接中国客人。不少社员说：我们应该搞好生产来欢迎周恩来同志，我们要用新的生产成绩，使我们的合作社无愧于罗中友好的名字。一位社员说，我们从广播中一听到周恩来同志要来罗马尼亚访问的消息时，就准备欢迎周恩来同志到我们这里来作客。罗中友好农业生产合作社主席乔·吉察的年逾八旬的父亲说：“周恩来同志的访问是件大喜事，使我们每一名社员都感到非常高兴。”
    下午四时许，当周恩来同志以及中国党政代表团的其他同志在罗共中央执委、中央常设主席团委员、部长会议第一副主席埃·波德纳拉希和罗共中央委员、罗共布加勒斯特州委员会第一书记格·尼古拉等同志的陪同下进入村口时，排列在道路两旁的社员群众，立即爆发出暴风雨般的掌声和雷鸣般的欢呼声，热情高呼“罗中两国人民友谊万岁！”
    周恩来同志下车后和迎上前来的罗中友好农业生产合作社主席乔·吉察同志热烈握手和拥抱。周恩来同志等还和罗共中央候补委员、布加勒斯特州人民会议执行委员会主席瓦·马特耶斯库、布加勒斯特州农业合作社联合会主席马·阿尔金特、罗共斯洛博济亚县委第一书记安·沃伊利亚努等一一热烈握手。一群穿着鲜艳民族服装的姑娘跑上前去把一束束鲜花献给中国客人，一位双鬓斑白的老社员向周恩来同志献了面包和盐，用最隆重的民族迎宾仪式欢迎了周恩来同志和其他中国客人。
    周恩来同志在罗中友好农业生产合作社主席乔·吉察和农业社党委书记康·德纳塞同志陪同下到农业社办公室，并听取了乔·吉察同志关于这个社的发展历史和在合作化后农牧业生产成就的介绍。随后，周恩来同志等参观了罗中友好农业生产合作社的养牛场和生长茁壮的小麦、玉米和向日葵，以及用北京芦沟桥中罗友好人民公社赠送的玉米种籽种植的试验田。
    接着，在罗中友好农业生产合作社的体育场上，举行了有附近各乡农业社员参加的近万人的盛大隆重的欢迎集会。罗中友好农业生产合作社主席乔·吉察、女社员扬·玛丽亚和周恩来同志先后在大会上讲了话。
    乔·吉察主席在集会上首先代表全体社员对周恩来同志来访表示热烈欢迎。他说，“我们怀着极大兴趣从广播、电视和报刊上注视着你们访问我国的情况。这些天来，我们也怀着当你们到达布加勒斯特时，罗马尼亚人民迎接你们时所表示出的那种友好情谊。我们知道中国人民对罗马尼亚人民也怀有同样热忱和深厚的友情”。
    吉察主席还详细叙述了罗中友好农业生产合作社和北京芦沟桥中罗友好人民公社的密切联系，并请周恩来同志转达他们全体社员对中国人民诚挚的兄弟般的友情。
    女社员扬·玛丽亚在集会上说，“我们整个乡今天都沉浸在愉快的气氛中。我们乡的居民满怀热忱迎接贵宾，迎接伟大中国人民的使者。”她说，我们十分密切地注视着中国人民在共产党领导下为建设社会主义所进行的胜利斗争。她还特别请周恩来同志转达罗中友好农业生产合作社的妇女对中国妇女的问候。
    周恩来同志在讲话时首先感谢罗中友好农业生产合作社社员们的热烈欢迎和亲切接待，并向他们转达了北京市芦沟桥中罗友好人民公社全体社员的兄弟般的问候。
    周恩来同志赞扬罗马尼亚人民在实现全国农业合作化以后，依靠集体经济的优越性和广大农民的积极性，迅速地提高了农业生产水平。周恩来同志说，今天，我们很高兴地看到，你们合作社的集体经济的一片繁荣景象。我们衷心祝愿你们不断取得新的更大的成就。
    周恩来同志接着说，中国共产党中央委员会和毛泽东主席一向重视农业，把它看作是国民经济的基础。我国广大农民依靠人民公社的优越性，在工业的大力支援下，正在迅速地提高农业生产。目前，我们全国正在开展一个学大寨、赶大寨、超大寨的群众运动。现在，全国已经出现了许多大寨式的先进单位，有力地推动我国农业的进一步发展。
    周恩来同志还说：“中罗两国人民在长期的革命斗争中，建立了亲密的友谊。你们农业生产合作社和北京芦沟桥中罗友好人民公社之间的友好联系就是我们两国人民这种友谊的一个生动例子。我相信，通过我们的这次访问，我们之间的友谊将进一步巩固和发展。”他们的讲话一再博得全场的热烈掌声和欢呼声。
    讲话结束后，罗共中央委员、罗共布加勒斯特州委第一书记格·尼古拉同志赠送给周恩来同志一部介绍该州工农业生产建设情况的画册，罗中友好农业生产合作社主席乔·吉察也代表全体社员向周恩来同志赠送了礼品。周恩来同志代表中国党政代表团赠送给罗中友好农业生产合作社一部电影放映机。
    周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团从布加勒斯特到罗中友好农业生产合作社的往返途中，受到了数十个村镇成千上万的社员和居民的热情欢迎，他们排在公路两旁，挥动着中罗两国国旗，用热烈的掌声和欢呼声向中国客人致意。
