    Our Heartfelt Voice
    Class One, Grade Five, Department of Political Education, Beijing Normal University
    Tai Yishun, Li Shumin, Pang Tianmin
    Beneath the loudspeaker, a sea of people surges,
    We listen to Chairman Mao's voice,
    Reforming the college entrance examination system,
    Like a spring thunder shaking the blue sky.
    We spread the news to each other,
    The entire school boils over in an instant,
    We shout "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    We sing and dance, rushing towards Tiananmen Square.
    Chairman Mao! You are incomparably wise and great,
    Guiding us to advance victoriously.
    We are graduating college students,
    About to embark on the revolutionary journey,
    We will certainly act according to your instructions,
    And become outstanding successors to the revolution.
    There will still be wind and rain ahead,
    The revolutionary road is full of struggle,
    But we firmly believe that as long as we have Mao Zedong Thought,
    The proletariat will surely remain red for generations.

    我们的心声
    北京师范大学政教系五年级（一）班
    太乙顺　李树民　庞天敏
    广播筒下一片人山人海，
    我们倾听毛主席的声音，
    改革高等学校招考办法，
    象一声春雷震动碧空。
    我们奔走相告，
    霎时全校沸腾，
    我们高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    我们载歌载舞涌向天安门。
    毛主席！您无比英明伟大，
    指引着我们胜利前进。
    我们是应届大学毕业生，
    即将奔赴革命的前程，
    我们一定照您的指示办事，
    做一个出色的革命接班人。
    前面还会有风雨，
    革命的道路充满着斗争，
    但我们坚信，只要有了毛泽东思想，
    定保无产阶级代代红。
