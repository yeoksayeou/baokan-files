　　Xinhua News Agency, June 6th. In recent days, people of all ethnic groups and the vast number of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have held meetings, posted big-character posters, and written to newspapers in various regions, warmly supporting the Party Central Committee's wise decision to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and angrily denouncing the anti-Party, anti-socialist crimes of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee's revisionist clique. They expressed common sentiments in different languages: to forever follow the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, resolutely defend the socialist nation of all ethnic groups, thoroughly smash all monsters and demons, and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end.

　　In their telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, more than 800 teachers, students, and staff members of 24 ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Yi, and Miao, at the Southwest Nationalities College said: "Most of us are emancipated slaves and serfs under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. We understand best that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are the great saviors of our working people of all ethnic groups, the socialist system is the source of our happiness, and the three red banners are our glorious banners. Like lotus leaves connected by their roots and fingers connected to the heart, Chairman Mao is flesh and blood with our people of all ethnic groups, and Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun and lifeline in the hearts of our people of all ethnic groups. We have only one goal: to always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and forever follow Chairman Mao."

　　Wang Suyin, a Uygur commune member from the Dadiwobao Brigade of the Jinxing Commune in the suburbs of Urumqi, Xinjiang, whose family had been hired laborers for landlords for three generations, excitedly said: "There are many bitter things in the world, but the bitterest is the old society; there are many sweet things in the world, but the sweetest is the socialism led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party; there are many poisonous things in the world, but the most poisonous are the anti-Party, anti-socialist monsters and demons. No matter how many anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds there are, we will pull them out; no matter how deep the roots of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line are, we will dig them up. We will forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the Communist Party, and resolutely carry the socialist revolution through to the end."

　　Delegates of all ethnic groups attending the Tibet Regional Conference of Activists in Studying Chairman Mao's Works in Lhasa said: We love Chairman Mao the most. The more the enemy opposes the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the more we must love the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of any "authority" or "expert." No matter what they pretend to be, we can see through them and defeat them.

　　Yingba, the Tibetan deputy secretary of the Longzang Township Party Committee in Xinghai County, Qinghai Province, said: "If wolves are not eliminated, sheep are not safe; if poisonous weeds are not removed, the grasslands will not flourish. Only by strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat and thoroughly overthrowing revisionism can we defend Mao Zedong Thought and prevent capitalist restoration."

　　Pagba, the Party branch secretary of a pastoral area in Inner Mongolia, said: "The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have seized the seal of power from the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee and firmly grasped it in the hands of our proletariat, demonstrating the immense power of our proletarian dictatorship. We, the people of the pastoral areas, will certainly listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and ferret out all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, big and small, and overthrow them all without exception."

　　In recent days, the vast number of commanders and fighters of the troops in Beijing, Shenyang, Jinan, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Kunming and other places, as well as the Navy and Air Force, have expressed their firmest and warmest support for these two decisions by putting out blackboard newspapers and big-character posters, holding discussions, and writing letters to newspapers. The students currently studying in the Engineering Corps Mao Zedong Thought Reading Class said that these two decisions powerfully struck the "Three-Family Village" black gang members hidden in the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Peking University Party Committee, removed them from office, and seized back the power of the proletariat, preventing them from using the name of the great Chinese Communist Party again, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, and engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal activities.

　　Many comrades of the guard troops stationed in the capital pointed out that the shocking fact that the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee had become a den of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements once again proves that Chairman Mao's theory on classes and class struggle in socialist society is entirely correct. Ma Yongxin, the political commissar of a certain regiment of the Beijing Military Region, said that the Party Central Committee's decision dug out the time bomb buried in our Party, seized back the people's seal of power, and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. It powerfully proves that as long as there is the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the worker-peasant-soldier masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, all monsters and demons will not escape the people's net. Liu Renfu, the former instructor of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" and political commissar of a certain regiment, said: "To eradicate weeds, we must remove the roots and thoroughly smash the 'Three-Family Village' by digging out the roots. Our People's Liberation Army is the Party's docile tool and the reliable pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. We must firmly grasp the proletarian gun and, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, firmly grasp the seal of power."

　　The vast number of commanders and fighters unanimously expressed: Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is our mortal enemy. No matter who they are, we must fight them resolutely, like bayoneting the enemy on the battlefield, and completely defeat them. Although this struggle has achieved a great victory, we must raise even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, pursue the victory, ferret out all anti-Party and anti-socialist monsters and demons, thoroughly expose them, thoroughly criticize them, and thoroughly discredit them.

    各族人民和解放军热烈拥护党中央改组北京市委的决定
    牢牢掌握印把子彻底打垮一切牛鬼蛇神
    新华社六日讯　我国各族人民和中国人民解放军广大指战员，近日来纷纷举行集会，贴出大字报，投书各地报社，热烈拥护党中央改组北京市委的英明决定，愤怒声讨前北京市委一伙修正主义分子的反党反社会主义罪行。他们用不同的语言，说出共同的话：要永远跟着各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席走，坚决保卫各族人民的社会主义江山，要彻底打垮一切牛鬼蛇神，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底。
    西南民族学院藏、彝、苗等二十四个民族的八百多名师生员工给党中央、毛主席的电报中说：“我们大部分是在党和毛主席领导下翻身的奴隶、农奴。我们最懂得毛主席、共产党是我们各族劳动人民的大救星，社会主义制度是我们幸福的源泉，三面红旗是我们光辉的旗帜。藕叶连根，十指连心，毛主席和我们各族人民骨肉相连，毛泽东思想是我们各族人民心中的红太阳、命根子。我们只有一个心眼，就是要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，永远跟着毛主席走。”
    新疆乌鲁木齐郊区金星公社大地窝堡大队祖孙三代给地主当过长工的维吾尔族社员王素音激动地说：“世界上有很多东西是苦的，最苦的是旧社会；世界上有很多东西是甜的，最甜的是毛主席和共产党领导的社会主义；世界上有很多东西是有毒的，最毒的是反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神。反党反社会主义的毒草有多少我们就拔多少，反党反社会主义黑线的根有多深我们就挖多深。我们要永远听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，坚决把社会主义革命进行到底。”
    正在拉萨出席西藏全区干部学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议的各族代表们说：我们最热爱毛主席，敌人越是反对党中央、反对毛主席，我们就越要热爱党中央，热爱毛主席。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大工农兵群众是不怕任何“权威”和“专家”的，不管他们装成什么，我们都能看得出来，也都能把他们打垮。
    青海省兴海县龙藏乡党委藏族副书记英巴说：“狼不消灭，羊不安全；毒草不除，草原不兴旺，只有加强无产阶级专政彻底打倒修正主义，才能捍卫毛泽东思想，防止资本主义复辟。”
    内蒙古牧区的党支部书记帕格巴说：“党中央和毛主席把印把子从前北京市委手里夺回来，牢牢地掌握在我们无产阶级手里，显示了我们无产阶级专政的强大威力，我们牧区人民一定听毛主席的话，坚决把社会主义革命进行到底，把大大小小的反党反社会主义分子全揪出来，一个不留地把他们全部打倒。”
    连日来，北京、沈阳、济南、南京、福州、广州、武汉、昆明等地部队和海军、空军等广大指战员出黑板报、大字报，举行座谈和给报社写信，对这两个决定表示最坚决、最热烈的拥护。正在工程兵毛主席著作读书班学习的学员们说，这两个决定，有力地打击了隐藏在前北京市委和北大党委的“三家村”黑帮分子，罢了他们的官，夺回了无产阶级的权，使他们再也不能盗用伟大的中国共产党的名义，打着“红旗”反红旗，进行反党反社会主义的罪恶勾当。
    驻首都的警卫部队许多同志指出，前北京市委成为反党反社会主义的老窝这一触目惊心的事实，又一次证明了毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级和阶级斗争的理论完全正确。北京部队某部团政委马永信说，党中央的决定，挖出了埋藏在我们党内的定时炸弹，夺回了人民的印把子，巩固了无产阶级专政。它有力地证明只要有党中央和毛主席的英明领导，有用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，一切牛鬼蛇神，都逃不出人民的罗网。“南京路上好八连”前任指导员、某团政治委员刘仁福说：“铲草要除根，要彻底捣毁‘三家村’，把根子挖出来。我们人民解放军是党的驯服工具，是无产阶级专政的可靠支柱，我们要牢牢掌握住无产阶级枪杆子，并且同广大工农群众、革命知识分子一道，牢牢掌握印把子。”
    广大指战员一致表示：谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是我们的死敌。不管他是什么人，我们都要象在战场上跟敌人拼刺刀那样，坚决跟他拼，把他彻底打倒。这场斗争虽然取得了伟大胜利，但是还必须更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜追击，把一切反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神揪出来，彻底揭发，彻底批判，彻底斗垮。
