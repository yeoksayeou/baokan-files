    In the first four months of this year, Guangdong Province planted 1,009,000 mu of bamboo, approaching the total bamboo planting area in the province from 1949 to 1964 (15 years).
    Guangdong has a mild climate and abundant rainfall, which is very conducive to bamboo growth. In the past, because people did not pay enough attention to the development of bamboo production, bamboo developed slowly and unevenly before 1963. The province had a total of about one million mu of bamboo, mostly concentrated in a few remote mountainous areas. Since 1964, after Guangdong Province has focused on developing bamboo as a key sideline project, bamboo planting activities have flourished. In the two years up to 1965, the province planted a total of 1.19 million mu of various bamboos.

    广东省种竹面积迅速增加
    今年头四个月，广东省种竹一百万零九千多亩，接近一九四九年到一九六四年十五年间全省种竹面积的总和。
    广东气候温和，雨量充沛，对竹子的生长十分有利。过去因为人们对发展竹子生产不够重视，在一九六三年以前竹子发展得又慢又不平衡，全省总共约有一百万亩竹子，大部分集中在少数偏僻的山区。从一九六四年起，广东省把发展竹子作为重点的副业项目抓起来之后，种竹活动就蓬勃开展起来，到一九六五年的两年中，全省共种各种竹子一百一十九万亩。
