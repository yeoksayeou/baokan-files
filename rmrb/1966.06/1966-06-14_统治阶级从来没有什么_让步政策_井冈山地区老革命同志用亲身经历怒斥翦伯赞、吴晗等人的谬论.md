    The Ruling Class Has Never Had a “Policy of Concessions”
    ——Old Revolutionary Comrades in the Jinggangshan Area Use Their Personal Experiences to Denounce the Fallacies of Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and Others
    Jiangxi Provincial and Ji'an Prefectural Federation of Philosophy and Social Sciences Investigation Team
    Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Philosophy and Social Sciences and the Ji'an Prefectural Federation of Philosophy and Social Sciences invited some old revolutionary comrades in the old revolutionary base areas of Jinggangshan and Ji'an to a forum. With a large number of facts from their personal experiences, they forcefully refuted the “policy of concessions” propagated by Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others. Jian Bozan and Wu Han said that after every major peasant war, the landlord class would adopt some “policy of concessions” to ease contradictions, thereby promoting production. The comrades who participated in the forum pointed out that the landlord class has never had a “policy of concessions” toward the peasants. Taking the old revolutionary base area of Jiangxi as an example, after the Red Army withdrew, Chiang Kai-shek did not adopt any "policy of concessions," but organized the landlord home-returning corps to implement the "three alls policy" of kill all, burn all, and loot all. Facts show that the class struggle between the exploiting class and the exploited class is a life-and-death struggle. The landlord class always implements the most brutal rule over the peasants. Modern history is like this, and so is past history. The old revolutionary comrades said with deep class feelings, enthusiastically and tearfully: Jian Bozan and Wu Han and others publicize the "policy of concessions," which is to promote the theory of class reconciliation, and write the history of class struggle, stained with blood and tears, as a "peace sutra"; to dress up the man-eating landlord robbers as "good people." This fallacy must be thoroughly refuted!
    The "Policy of Concessions" Theory Depicts a History of Class Struggle Stained with Blood and Tears as a "Peace Sutra"
    Ouyang Guishan (Long March cadre, retired old cadre in Ji'an area, branch secretary) said: Jian Bozan and Wu Han put forward that after the failure of the peasant revolutionary uprising, the new feudal ruling class would make concessions to the people, which is all deceptive nonsense. There has never been a concession from the exploiting class to the exploited class; the exploiting class always tries its best to attack the exploited class by various means. The nature of the reactionaries will not change. Chairman Mao taught us that the enemy will not "lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." The reactionaries will only cruelly suppress peasant revolutionary uprisings, and they will not make concessions to the people. According to Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others, after the failure of the Great Revolution, Chiang Kai-shek had just come to power, and the reactionaries should have "made concessions," right? However, Chiang Kai-shek organized the landlord home-returning corps to carry out a frenzied massacre of the revolutionary people.
    Xie Huaifu (old Red Guard member, Chairman Mao's old landlord) said: The landlord class is very vicious, using whips and butcher knives to exploit and oppress the people. Because they are reactionaries, they always want to eat people. In 1929, after the Red Army temporarily transferred, the reactionaries burned and killed in Maoping for forty days. Their slogan was "The thatch-roofed houses should be burned to ashes, the stones should be knifed, and the people should be changed." In those forty days, the reactionaries burned down 104 houses and more than 890 rooms. All the villages such as Cangbian, Mayuan Pit, and Bashang were burned down. More than 40 cadres and more than 200 revolutionary people were killed. Six families were exterminated, creating a horrific white terror. Li Mingfa, a member of the Niuyapi Village Riot, and his family of five were killed, even the seventy-year-old grandmother and paralyzed patients were killed. Some were disemboweled and their hearts were dug out, and some were cut in half. The reactionaries used various tortures to persecute revolutionary masses, such as pouring chili water, pressing bars, and lighting sky lanterns. The reactionaries are so vicious. Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others repeatedly publicized the so-called "policy of concessions," which is to cover up these bloody facts. Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others described a bloody history of class struggle as a "peace sutra" of the reactionaries, which is really vicious and sinister.
    Luo Dongxiang (served as secretary of the Xin Sui Border Special Zone during the Land Revolution, now in the Jinggangshan Home of Honored Elders) said: The nature of the reactionaries cannot be changed. They always want to exploit and oppress the people, and they will never make concessions to the people. Wu Han once praised the Kuomintang for doing some good things and making concessions to the people. This is a big lie. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, after the Red Army left Jinggangshan, the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented the "three alls policy"—kill all, burn all, and loot all. As soon as they entered the sentry post, regardless of men, women, old, or young, they killed anyone they saw. More than 30 people were killed in Dajing, and six families were exterminated. Xiaojing used to be a street, with 33 households, and only 6 households remained. Xiao Jiabi, the commander of the township security force, nicknamed "Butcher Xiao," was a ruthless executioner. He killed people as soon as he came, "the knife must see blood." Tell Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others that we have seen through your "policy of concessions." Its practical significance is to cover up Chiang Kai-shek's "three alls policy" and cover up the bloody massacre of feudal landlords.
    Luo Jiusheng (Long March cadre, retired) said with tears of indignation: The "policy of concessions" of the exploiting class simply does not exist. There are more than 30 households in Shangnanshan Village, Longzhou Commune, Jishui County, my hometown. In the old society, generations were exploited and oppressed by the landlord class. After a year of hard work, the landlords took two-thirds of the rice harvested. Poor and lower-middle peasants were in a state of "sickles hung on the wall, no food at home," relying on chaff and vegetables for a living. In 1929, the Red Army arrived in my hometown, beat local tyrants, and distributed land, and the peasants turned over. But in 1930, when the counter-revolutionary encirclement and suppression came, the landlords robbed all the land and grain we had divided. My elder brother, Luo Liujin, was the chairman of the peasant association. He was arrested by the landlord's armed forces and killed in Futian. His body was thrown into the river. At that time, I was a Young Pioneer. I couldn't stand in my hometown, so I joined the Red Army. After I left, the landlord did not allow my mother to live in my hometown and drove her to a nunnery in Shuidong, Ji'an to eat fast. Comrade Liu Dehua, who left with me, his wife suffered all kinds of persecution from the landlord class at home, smashed her pot, destroyed her begging basket, scolded her, beat her, and tortured her, forcing this female comrade to go crazy. The landlord class took away our fruits of labor, killed our heads, occupied our wives and daughters, and burned our houses. They only squeezed and massacred the peasants, so where is the "concession"? However, Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others did their best to distort history and vigorously promoted the "policy of concessions," beautifying the criminal history of the reactionary ruling class. They are serving the landlord and bourgeois conspiracy to restore.
    Liu Ailian (military family member) also tearfully accused: The reactionaries are extremely evil and wolf-hearted, and they will never make concessions to the people. In 1929, Chairman Mao came to our Yongxin and established the Workers' and Peasants' Government, and the land returned to the old home. After the Red Army's Long March in 1934, the landlord's armed forces wanted to kill all, burn all, and loot all of us. My father and brother were severely tortured, and my younger brother Erjie (only a teenager) was brutally killed by the enemy with a knife. They scolded us as "bandits' children and bandits' women," forcing us to be separated from our wives and children, and our families were destroyed. Wang Qikai, who lived next door to me, and his two brothers joined the army. Qikai's wife took a four or five-year-old child and hid under the bed, but was also killed by the reactionaries, who said they wanted to cut the grass and eradicate the roots. Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others said that after every peasant war, the reactionaries would make concessions to the revolutionary people. This is the biggest political deception.
    Zou Guanggui (poor peasant, production team leader) used bloody historical facts to refute the "policy of concessions" promoted by Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others. He said: One day in 1929 when there was a heavy fog, the reactionaries sneaked into the mountains from below Huangyangjie. My father and uncles were all members of the riot team. They were unable to retreat in time and were killed by the reactionaries. From that day on, blood flowed in the large and small Wujing for more than forty days. Inside and outside the houses, under the bridges, and on the roads were all corpses. Everywhere only crows were seen, but no people. A few days later, the landlord's armed township security force came again and killed my grandfather, grandmother, and other four people. Of our family of twenty-eight, six were killed, and twelve died of starvation and cold, a total of eighteen sacrifices. Thinking of the bloody history of the past, my heart is really burning with anger. Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others still want to talk about the landlord's "policy of concessions" to the peasants. They are really lying with their eyes open.
    The "Policy of Concessions" Theory Dresses Up the Man-Eating Landlord Robbers as "Good People"
    Luo Dongxiang said: Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others vigorously promoted that the ruling class would implement a "policy of concessions" to the peasants, reduce the oppression and exploitation of the people, and promote production and development, and so on. This is the greatest distortion of history and a big lie. The exploiting class always oppresses and exploits the people, and will never make concessions to the people and do good things. Landlords have always been greedy. If they lose a liter here, they will take back a picul there. When will they reduce exploitation? Peasant uprisings infringe on their interests, and they will increase oppression and exploitation. This has been the case throughout history, both at home and abroad. In 1928, the Red Army distributed land and grain to us in Jinggangshan. That year, the autumn harvest was abundant, and every household was full of grain. After the Red Army left in 1929, the reactionaries came and robbed all our fruits of struggle, further increasing exploitation. What head tax, household tax, monthly tax, what county granary grain, township granary grain, security granary grain, staff grain, horse feed grain, what straw sandal fees, school fees, and so on, as well as conscription, apportionment of funds, apportionment of grain, killing, arson, really no profit is not taken, no evil is not done. It made it so that no one dared to live in the five major sentry posts. Production was abandoned, and life was even more difficult. Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others said that the landlords made concessions to the peasants and reduced the burden, which is the same tune as Mu Renzhi robbing Xi'er to Huang Shiren's house, and saying that he was letting Xi'er enjoy happiness. It is really the logic of robbers.
    Xie Huaifu said: After the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army withdrew from the Jiangxi base area, the landlord class did not reduce the exploitation of the peasants at all, but intensified it and increased exploitation. As soon as the reactionaries came in 1929, the landlords not only took away the land, but also forced the peasants to pay two years' rent. The debts that the Red Army had announced to be abolished were forced to be repaid double. At that time, my family borrowed a picul of grain from the landlord, which was only worth two silver dollars at the current price. When the price of grain rose, the grain was converted into silver dollars; when the price of grain fell, the silver dollars were converted into grain. After three years of conversion, plus interest compounded, the landlord finally took away my two acres of land worth sixty yuan. Is this reducing exploitation?
    Zheng Shanzhi (served as a Red Army soldier during the Land Revolution, now at Huangyangjie) said: I don't believe that after peasant uprisings in history, the landlord class would reduce the exploitation of the peasants. I can prove it with my own experience that even when the people's revolutionary struggle was developing fiercely, the landlord class would not reduce the exploitation of the peasants. In 1934, I worked as a long-term laborer for a landlord surnamed Zheng in Hunan. At the beginning, it was said to be three baskets of grain a month, but after five months, I didn't get a penny, and I worked for nothing, and I couldn't even get enough to eat. Isn't this cruel exploitation? However, Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others said that after the revolution, the landlords would reduce exploitation, which is completely deceptive. You gang of black gangs are really black-hearted. We peasants worked hard to grow grain to feed you, and you still speak for the landlord class and deceive us peasants. You are really full of sores from head to toe, and you are extremely bad.
    Liang Bishan (chairman of the Ji'an City Federation of Trade Unions) said: The so-called "policy of concessions" is the smiling tiger policy of the landlord and bourgeoisie. In 1927, the workers' and peasants' movement developed, and Ji'an City organized a trade union, which had a great influence. The bourgeoisie pretended to be very honest on the surface, maybe it was the "policy of concessions" that Wu Han and others said! I remember that at that time, there were two big capitalists in Ji'an, Kang Wenqing and Liu Zhiyi. Due to the momentum of the workers' and peasants' movement, they seemed to "make concessions" on the surface, with sweet words, bowing and scraping, and talking about improving the lives of employees and increasing wages. In fact, they were hypocritical and extremely hated the workers' movement. After the failure of the Great Revolution, they conspired to kill my father—then the chairman of the Ji'an Trade Union, and also arrested my mother, my lover, and my whole family and put them in jail. When liberation was approaching, they put on smiling faces again. My mother suffered torture in prison and suffered from a serious illness, so they pretended to send a bowl of ginseng soup. My mother simply ignored them. We have seen through them. Their so-called "policy of concessions" is just a painted skin on the body of an evil ghost. Jian Bozan and Wu Han still want to apply rouge and powder to the painted skin of the evil ghost, which is a waste of effort.
    The "Policy of Concessions" Theory Wants Us to Withdraw from the Position of the Proletarian Dictatorship and Give Way to Demons and Monsters
    Ouyang Guishan said: Modern revisionism promotes that imperialism will compromise with the people, but in fact, it wants the people to compromise with imperialism, in order to cover up the revisionist line of surrendering to imperialism. Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others vigorously promoted the "policy of concessions" of the landlord class, but in fact, they wanted the peasants to make concessions to the landlord class. They talked about "using the past to serve the present." How to use it? Today, our country does not have any "new feudal ruling class." The landlord class has been overthrown. Today, the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants are the masters of the country. Who do we make concessions to? How to make concessions? Obviously, their promotion of the "policy of concessions" is to ask us, the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, to make concessions to all the demons and monsters such as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, withdraw from the position of the proletarian revolution, hand over the seal of the proletarian dictatorship, and hand over our guns, so that capitalism can be restored and demons and monsters can run rampant freely. This is their intention!
    Jian Bozan, Wu Han, you gang of demons and monsters have done enough evil, and you have done enough damage to the Party and the cause of socialist revolution. Your arrogance has come to an end. We must not make concessions to you! If we make concessions to you, that is to betray the revolution; that is to let imperialism, feudal forces, and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries ride on the heads of the Chinese people again; that is to make the Chinese people return to the miserable life of being oppressed, exploited, and treated as beasts of burden before liberation. Concessions to you are cruelty to the people! The people in our old revolutionary base areas will not agree, and the workers, peasants, and all revolutionary people across the country will not agree. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our revolutionary people have gone through untold hardships, sacrificed the lives of many comrades, and built the country with guns, and we must not let it to you gang of black gangs! We have no concessions to make to you. We can only fight you to the end, thoroughly eliminate the demons and monsters, and use a sentence from our old revolutionary base area: "Not to leave one alive!"
    Luo Jiusheng said: Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others' "policy of concessions" theory is in line with the offensive launched by the landlords and bourgeoisie in the country against the Party and socialism a few years ago. From 1959 to 1962, our country encountered temporary difficulties, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists thought the time had come and launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, shouting that the people's commune was "messed up," demanding "three freedoms and one guarantee," and blowing the "go-it-alone wind," attempting to counterattack and settle accounts and conspiring to restore. At this time, Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others desperately shouted that feudal landlords were making "concessions" to the people, giving the people "good days." Are you just talking about ancient times? Are you just doing it for the sake of the past? No, you are opposing the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front and the economic front, trying to force us to make concessions to the landlord bourgeoisie, let the demons and monsters come to power, "exercise" our dictatorship, and "revolutionize" our lives, riding on our heads again, making a show of power. "Policy of concessions" is a trick to clear the way for demons and monsters. Tell you, those who hunt tigers know the nature of tigers, and we know how to deal with landlords and reactionaries. It is wishful thinking to make concessions to you in the face of your large-scale offensive and not give you a fatal blow.
    Wang Tianshen (Long March cadre, retired) said: Jian Bozan and Wu Han's "policy of concessions" echoes the international class struggle and meets the needs of the enemy internationally. Just when the world revolution is surging, the East wind prevails over the West wind, and imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries are launching a counterattack, jointly opposing communism, opposing China, and opposing the world people's revolution, they are promoting that the reactionaries are "wise," have "rationality," and can "coexist peacefully" by making a little concession to them. At this time, Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others desperately promoted the "policy of concessions," which is in the same tune as revisionism and is the same kind of stuff.
    Liang Bishan said: I feel very angry when I hear about the "policy of concessions." The "policy of concessions" touted by Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others is to ask the revolutionary people to surrender to the landlord class and the bourgeoisie. Isn't this clearly opposing the proletarian revolution and the proletarian dictatorship, and letting the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists take power? Our dispute with Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others is not an academic issue, but a political issue, a life-and-death struggle. This struggle is seriously related to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We must resolutely and thoroughly defeat the frenzied attack of Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others against the Party and socialism.
    Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Open Fire on the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Gang, and Carry the Revolution Through to the End
    Luo Dongxiang said: Only by overthrowing the landlord class can the peasants have a good life. Before the Land Revolution, the peasants in our Jinggangshan suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression, living a life worse than cattle and horses. We were not even allowed to pass by the doorsteps of the landlords' houses. In 1927, Chairman Mao went to Jinggangshan and led us peasants to rise up in revolution, beat local tyrants, distribute land, abolish rent and debt, and whoever planted it would harvest it. The peasants' enthusiasm for production rose unprecedentedly, and many lands that had been barren for many years were reclaimed. That year, a bumper harvest was achieved, and the yield per mu increased from 200 to 300 jin to 500 to 600 jin. The selling price of salt per jin fell from more than one yuan to 30 to 40 cents, and the peasants turned over. At that time, it was a war environment, and life was relatively difficult, but the spirit was very happy. After the Red Army went north, the reactionaries implemented the "three alls policy" in Jinggangshan. The people of Jinggangshan did not succumb. They buried the remains of their companions, wiped the blood from their bodies, stood up and continued to fight. After liberation, the people of Jinggangshan saw the light of day again, and now the face of the mountainous area has been completely renewed. The peasants' revolution is the driving force of social development! The landlord class never makes concessions to us, and we will never make any concessions to the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. We will follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and continue the revolution and the revolution to the end! Let Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others' "policy of concessions" go to hell!
    Zou Guanggui said: After liberation, the peasants turned over greatly. The landlord class and all reactionaries are still unwilling to die. Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and others' promotion of the "policy of concessions" is a manifestation of the lingering souls of the landlord class. The people of Jinggangshan were personally cultivated by Chairman Mao. We farm for the revolution and add bricks and tiles for the construction of socialism. We will never allow Jian Bozan, Wu Han, and other demons and monsters to dig the foundations of socialism. In order to defend the fruits of our revolutionary victory, defend the Party, and defend socialism, we will resolutely open fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs! We will never stop fighting until we win a complete victory! We must strive to study Chairman Mao's works, study and apply them in a living way, work hard on the application of Mao Zedong Thought, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end!

    统治阶级从来没有什么“让步政策”
    ——井冈山地区老革命同志用亲身经历怒斥翦伯赞、吴晗等人的谬论
    江西省和吉安专区哲学社会科学联合会调查组
    最近，江西省哲学社会科学联合会和吉安专区哲学社会科学联合会，在井冈山、吉安老革命根据地，邀请一些老革命同志座谈。他们以大量亲身经历的事实，对翦伯赞、吴晗等人宣传的“让步政策”，进行了有力的驳斥。翦伯赞、吴晗说，每次大的农民战争以后，地主阶级都会采取一些“让步政策”，以缓和矛盾，从而促进了生产。参加座谈会的同志们指出，地主阶级对农民从来就没有什么“让步政策”，以江西老革命根据地为例，当年红军撤离之后，蒋介石就没有采取什么“让步政策”，而是组织地主还乡团，实行杀光、烧光、抢光的“三光政策”。事实说明：剥削阶级和被剥削阶级之间的阶级斗争，是你死我活的斗争。地主阶级对于农民，任何时候都是实行最残酷的统治的。现代的历史是这样，过去的历史也是这样。老革命同志怀着深厚的阶级感情，慷慨激昂，声泪俱下地说道：翦伯赞和吴晗等人宣扬“让步政策”，就是宣传阶级调和论，把血泪斑斑的阶级斗争史写成是一部“和平经”；把吃人的地主强盗打扮成为“好人”。这种谬论必须彻底驳倒！
    “让步政策”论把一部血泪斑斑的阶级斗争史描绘成“和平经”
    欧阳贵山（长征干部，吉安地区退休老干部，支部书记）说：翦伯赞、吴晗提出在农民革命起义失败后，新的封建统治阶级会对人民让步，这全是骗人的鬼话。剥削阶级对被剥削阶级的让步，从来是没有的；剥削阶级总是采取各种手法竭力向被剥削阶级进攻。反动派的本性是不会改变的。毛主席教导我们，敌人是不会“放下屠刀，立地成佛”的。反动派对待农民革命起义，只会残酷地镇压，他们是不会向人民让步的。按照翦伯赞、吴晗等人的说法，大革命失败，蒋介石刚刚上台，反动派总该“让步”了吧。可是蒋介石却组织地主还乡团，对革命人民进行疯狂的大屠杀。
    谢槐福（老赤卫队员，毛主席的老房东）说：地主阶级是十分恶毒的，是拿着鞭子和屠刀，剥削压迫人民的。因为他们是反动派，总是要吃人的。一九二九年红军暂时转移以后，反动派在茅坪烧杀四十天之久。他们的口号是“茅房过火，石头过刀，人要换种”。在那四十多天中，反动派烧毁房屋一百零四幢，八百九十多间仓边、马园坑、霸上等村庄全部被烧光。杀害干部四十多人，革命群众二百多人，被杀绝的有六户，造成了惨绝人寰的白色恐怖。牛哑陂村暴动队员李明发一家五口被杀绝，连七十多岁的老太婆和瘫痪病人也被杀害了。有的被剖腹挖心，有的被腰斩三截。反动派残害革命群众，使用了各种酷刑，如灌辣椒水，压杠子，点天灯等等。反动派就是这样的狠毒。翦伯赞、吴晗一再宣扬什么“让步政策”，就是要把这些血淋淋的事实掩盖起来。翦伯赞、吴晗等人把一部血淋淋的阶级斗争历史，说成是反动派的“和平经”，真够毒辣阴险。
    罗冬祥（土地革命时曾任新遂边防特区秘书，现在井冈山光荣敬老院）说：反动派的本性是改变不了的。他们总是要剥削压迫人民，决不会向人民让步。吴晗曾经吹捧国民党会做些好事，会向人民让步。这是弥天大谎。在第二次国内革命战争时期，红军离开井冈山后，国民党反动派实行“三光政策”——杀光、烧光、抢光。他们一进哨口，不问男女老幼，见人就杀。大井被杀三十多人，六户灭种。小井原来是一条街，三十三户，只剩下了六户。挨户团总指挥萧家壁，外号“萧屠夫”，是一个杀人不眨眼的刽子手。他一来就是杀人，“刀必见血”。告诉翦伯赞、吴晗等人，你们的“让步政策”，我们已经看透了，它的现实意义就是掩护蒋介石的“三光政策”，掩护封建地主的血腥屠杀。
    罗久生（长征干部，已退休）含着热泪愤慨地说：剥削阶级的“让步政策”是根本不存在的。我的家乡吉水县陇洲公社上南山村，有三十几户人家。在旧社会里，世世代代受地主阶级的剥削和压迫，一年辛苦到头，收的谷子地主要拿去三分之二。贫下中农是“镰刀挂上壁，家里没饭吃”，靠糠菜为生。一九二九年，红军到了我的家乡，打土豪，分田地，农民翻了身。可是到一九三○年，反革命围剿一来，地主把我们分得的土地、粮食都抢走了。我的哥哥罗六斤是农会主席，被地主武装抓到富田杀害了，尸首抛在河里。我那时是少先队员，在家乡站不住脚，参加了红军。我走后，地主不准我母亲在家乡居住，把她撵到吉安水东的一个尼姑庵里吃长斋。和我一同走的柳德华同志，他爱人在家受尽了地主阶级的迫害，打碎她的锅，毁掉她的讨饭篮，骂她打她摧残她，活活地把这个女同志逼疯了。地主阶级夺去我们的劳动果实，杀我们的头，霸占我们的妻女，烧我们的房屋，他们对农民只有压榨、屠杀，那有“让步”？而翦伯赞、吴晗等人极尽歪曲历史之能事，大肆宣扬“让步政策”，美化反动统治阶级的罪恶历史。他们是在为地主、资产阶级阴谋复辟效劳。
    刘爱莲（军属）也含着眼泪控诉说：反动派是万恶滔天、狼心狗肺的，它根本不会向人民让步。一九二九年，毛主席到我们永新，成立工农政府，土地回老家。一九三四年红军长征后，地主武装要把我们杀光、烧光、抢光。我的父亲、哥哥遭到严刑拷打，弟弟二街（才十几岁）被敌人用刀活活杀死。骂我们是“土匪子女土匪婆”，逼得我们妻离子散，家破人亡。住在我隔壁的王其开两兄弟参军去了，其开的老婆带着一个四、五岁的小孩躲在床底下，也被反动派杀害了，他们说是要斩草除根。翦伯赞、吴晗等人说每次农民战争以后，反动派会向革命人民让步，这是最大的政治欺骗。
    邹官桂（贫农，生产队长）用血泪斑斑的历史事实，驳斥了翦伯赞、吴晗等人宣扬的“让步政策”。他说：一九二九年下大雾的一天，反动派从黄洋界下面摸进山来，我的父亲、叔伯都是暴动队员，来不及撤退，被反动派杀害了。从那天起，大小五井流了四十多天血，屋里屋外，桥下路上都是尸体，到处只见老鸦不见人。过了几天，地主武装挨户团又来了，又把我的祖父、祖母等四人杀害了。我们全家二十八人，被杀害了六口，饿死冻死十二口，一共牺牲十八口。想起过去的血泪史，心里真是怒火燃烧。翦伯赞、吴晗等人还要讲什么地主会对农民实行“让步政策”，真是睁着眼睛说瞎话。
    “让步政策”论把吃人的地主强盗打扮成为“好人”
    罗冬祥说：翦伯赞、吴晗大肆宣扬统治阶级会对农民实行“让步政策”，减轻对人民的压迫与剥削，推动生产发展，等等。这是对历史的最大歪曲，是弥天大谎。剥削阶级对人民总是压迫、剥削的，决不会给人民让步，做好事。从来地主都是财迷，他们在这里丢了一升，就要在那里收回一担。什么时候他们会减轻剥削？农民起义触犯了他们的利益，他们就要加重压迫和剥削，古今中外都是这样的。一九二八年红军在井冈山给我们分田分谷，那年秋后丰收，家家谷满仓。一九二九年红军走后，反动派来了，把我们的斗争果实抢光，更加加重剥削，什么人头捐、门户捐、月月捐，什么县仓谷、乡仓谷、保仓谷、员工谷、马料谷，什么草鞋费、学堂费，等等，还有抓丁、派款、派粮，杀人、放火，真是无利不取，无恶不作。搞得五大哨口，没有人敢居住。生产荒废，生活更苦。翦伯赞、吴晗等人说，地主对农民让步，减轻负担，这和穆仁智把喜儿抢到黄世仁家里去，还说是让喜儿享福，是一个腔调，真是强盗的逻辑。
    谢槐福说：工农红军撤离江西根据地以后，地主阶级一点也没减轻对农民的剥削，而是变本加厉，加重剥削。一九二九年反动派一来，地主不但夺去了土地，还强迫农民要交二年的租，红军宣布废了的债，要强迫农民加倍偿还，欠一担的要还二担。那时我家里借了地主一石谷，按时价只合银洋两元，到谷子涨价时，又把谷子折成银元；到谷子跌价时，又把银元折成谷子。折来折去，折了三年，加上利滚利，地主终于把我价值六十元的两亩地夺去了。这是减轻剥削吗？
    郑善致（土地革命时当过红军，现在黄洋界）说：我不相信历史上农民起义之后，地主阶级会减轻对农民的剥削。我用自己的经验可以证明，就在人民革命斗争激烈发展的时候，地主阶级也不会减轻对农民的剥削。一九三四年，我给湖南一个姓郑的地主打长工，开头说得好，三箩谷一个月，可是做了五个月，一个钱也没得到，白白劳动，连饭也吃不饱。这不是残酷剥削吗？而翦伯赞、吴晗等人说，革命后地主会减轻剥削，完全是骗人的。你们这班黑帮真是黑心肠，我们农民自己辛苦种出来的粮食养肥了你们，你们还替地主阶级说话，欺骗我们农民。你们真是头顶生疮，脚板流脓，坏透顶了。
    梁必善（吉安市工会主席）说：所谓“让步政策”，就是地主资产阶级的笑面虎的政策。一九二七年工农运动发展，吉安市组织了工会，影响很大。资产阶级表面装得很老实了，也许是吴晗等说的“让步政策”吧！记得当时吉安有两个大资本家，康文卿、刘志益，由于工农运动的声势，表面上好象“让步”了，甜言蜜语，点头哈腰，大谈改善职工生活，增加工资，其实呢，口蜜腹剑，对工人运动极端仇恨。大革命失败以后，他们阴谋杀害了我的父亲——当时吉安工会主席，还把我和我的母亲，我的爱人，全家都抓去坐牢。快到解放时，他们又装起笑脸来了。我的母亲在牢房里受折磨患了重病，他们就假意送一碗参汤来。我的母亲根本不理他们，我们已经看透了他们。他们所谓的“让步政策”，不过是恶鬼身上的一张画皮，翦伯赞、吴晗现在还想在恶鬼的画皮上搽脂抹粉，是枉费心机的。
    “让步政策”论是要我们撤出无产阶级专政的阵地，给牛鬼蛇神让路
    欧阳贵山说：现代修正主义宣传帝国主义会向人民妥协，实际上是要人民向帝国主义妥协，以掩饰修正主义对帝国主义的投降路线。翦伯赞、吴晗等人大吹地主阶级的“让步政策”，实际上是要农民对地主阶级让步。他们口口声声讲要“古为今用”，怎么用？今天我国没有什么“新的封建统治阶级”，地主阶级已经被打倒了，今天当家作主的是工人和贫下中农，我们向谁让步？怎么让？很明显，他们宣扬“让步政策”，就是要我们工人阶级、贫下中农向地富反坏右等一切牛鬼蛇神让步，撤出无产阶级革命的阵地，交出无产阶级专政的印把子，缴掉我们的枪杆子，使资本主义复辟，使牛鬼蛇神无法无天地自由泛滥起来。这就是他们的用意所在！
    翦伯赞、吴晗，你们这批牛鬼蛇神作恶已经够多了，你们对党对社会主义革命事业的破坏已经够毒了，你们的猖狂也已经到头了。我们决不能向你们让步！要是向你们让步，那就是背叛革命；那就是让帝国主义、封建势力、蒋介石反动派重新骑到中国人民头上；那就是使中国人民回到解放前受压迫、受剥削、做牛做马的悲惨生活中去。对你们的让步就是对人民的残忍！我们老革命根据地的人民决不会答应，全国的工人、贫下中农和一切革命的人民都不会答应。我们革命人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，经历了千辛万苦，牺牲了许多同志的生命，用枪杆子打出来的江山，决不能让给你们这班黑帮！我们对你们毫无让步可言，只有跟你们斗争到底，把牛鬼蛇神彻底铲除，用我们老革命根据地的一句话来说：就是要“一个不留情”！
    罗久生说：翦伯赞、吴晗等人的“让步政策”论，是和头几年国内地主、资产阶级向党向社会主义的进攻相策应的。一九五九年至一九六二年，我国遇到了暂时困难，地富反坏右以为时机到了，向党向社会主义发动了猖狂进攻，叫喊人民公社“搞糟了”，要“三自一包”，刮“单干风”，企图反攻倒算，阴谋复辟。这时，翦伯赞、吴晗等人拼命大喊大叫封建地主向人民“让步”，给人民“好日子过”。你们难道只是讲古代，难道是为古而古吗？不，你们是在反对政治思想战线上和经济战线上的社会主义革命，企图迫使我们向地主资产阶级让步，让牛鬼蛇神上台，“专”我们的政，“革”我们的命，重新骑在我们头上，作威作福。“让步政策”就是为牛鬼蛇神鸣锣开道的花招。告诉你们，打虎的人是知道虎的本性的，我们是晓得怎样对付地主、反动派的。要想在你们大举进攻面前，向你们让步，不给你们以致命打击，那是痴心妄想。
    王天申（长征干部，已退休）说：翦伯赞、吴晗的“让步政策”，是与国际上的阶级斗争相呼应的，是适应国际上敌人的需要的。正当世界革命风起云涌，东风压倒西风，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派进行反扑，联合反共反华反对世界人民革命的时候，他们宣扬什么反动派“明智”了，有“理性”了，对他们让一点步，就可以“和平共处”了。在这种时候，翦伯赞、吴晗等人拼命宣扬什么“让步政策”，是和修正主义一鼻孔出气，是一路货。
    梁必善说：我听到什么“让步政策”，非常愤慨。翦伯赞、吴晗等人吹捧的“让步政策”，就是要革命的人民群众向地主阶级、资产阶级缴械投降。这不是明明白白反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，让地富反坏右执政吗？我们与翦伯赞、吴晗等人的争论，不是什么学术问题，而是政治问题，是一场你死我活的斗争。这一场斗争，是严重地关系到中国革命、关系到世界革命的大事，必须坚决彻底打垮翦伯赞、吴晗等人向党向社会主义的猖狂进攻。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向反党反社会主义的黑帮开火，将革命进行到底
    罗冬祥说：只有打倒地主阶级，农民才有好日子过。在土地革命以前，我们井冈山的农民受尽了剥削和压迫，过着不如牛马的生活，地主的家门口都不许我们过路。一九二七年毛主席上了井冈山，领导我们农民起来革命，打土豪，分田地，废租废债，谁种谁收，农民生产的劲头空前高涨起来，荒了许多年的土地都开垦出来了；当年就取得了生产大丰收，亩产由二、三百斤提高到五、六百斤，食盐每斤卖价由一块多钱跌到三、四角钱，农民翻了身。那时是战争环境，生活比较艰苦，但是精神非常愉快。红军北上以后，反动派在井冈山实行“三光政策”，井冈山的人民并没有屈服，他们掩埋好同伴的遗体，擦干身上的血迹，站起来继续战斗。解放以后，井冈山的人民重见天日，现在山区的面貌已经焕然一新。农民的革命是社会发展的动力！地主阶级从来不向我们让步，我们也决不会向地富反坏右让一点步，我们要跟着共产党、毛主席，不断革命、革命到底！叫翦伯赞、吴晗等人的“让步政策”见鬼去吧！
    邹官桂说：解放以后，农民大翻身，地主阶级和一切反动派还不甘心死亡。翦伯赞、吴晗等人宣扬“让步政策”，就是地主阶级阴魂不散的表现。我们井冈山人民是毛主席亲手培养起来的，我们为革命种田，为建设社会主义添砖添瓦，决不容许翦伯赞、吴晗等牛鬼蛇神来挖社会主义的墙脚。为了保卫我们革命胜利的果实，保卫党、保卫社会主义，我们坚决向反党反社会主义的黑帮开火！不获全胜，决不收兵！我们一定要努力学习毛主席著作，活学活用，在用字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，高高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，将社会主义革命进行到底！
