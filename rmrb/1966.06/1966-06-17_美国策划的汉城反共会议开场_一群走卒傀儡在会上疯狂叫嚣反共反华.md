    According to Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, June 15th: The "Ministerial Meeting" of anti-communist nations and puppet groups in Asia and the Pacific region, orchestrated by the United States, opened in Seoul on the 14th. This is an important step taken by the United States after shifting its strategic focus to the East, to step up the effort to piece together a "anti-communist alliance in Asia" with Japan as its core, and to implement a policy of "containment" against China. At the same time, it is also a component of the intensified collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the joint anti-China conspiracy.
    The conference was prepared and hosted by the Park Chung-hee group in South Korea. Representatives from Japan, the South Korean puppet group, the South Vietnamese puppet group, the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, "Malaysia," Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand attended the meeting. The Vientiane authorities in Laos also sent observers to participate.
    All indications show that the United States is attempting to bring them together politically, economically, and militarily through this conference, forming an anti-communist military alliance aimed at China, and using this conference to serve the American war of aggression in Vietnam.
    At the meeting on the 14th, some participating "representatives" issued frantic anti-communist and anti-China howls. Park Chung-hee clamored in the opening ceremony that "in the showdown with international communism, the use of force is necessary and inevitable." Lee Dong-won, who served as the "chairman" of the meeting, advocated that participants fight against the so-called "communist threat." South Korean "representative" Park Chung-hoon advocated at the meeting the establishment of an "effective regional organization" for "comprehensive cooperation," for more frequent contact and consultation on "all issues of common concern," and blatantly called for Asian countries to participate in the American war of aggression in Vietnam. Wei Dao-ming, a representative of the Chiang gang, also clamored against communism at the meeting.

    美国策划的汉城反共会议开场
    一群走卒傀儡在会上疯狂叫嚣反共反华
    据新华社十五日讯　汉城消息：由美国策划的亚洲和太平洋地区反共国家和傀儡集团“部长会议”十四日在汉城开场。这是美国在战略重点东移以后，为了加紧拼凑以日本为核心的“亚洲反共联盟”，执行“遏制”中国政策的一个重要步骤；同时，这也是苏美加紧勾结、联合反华阴谋的一个组成部分。
    这个会议是由南朝鲜朴正熙集团出面筹备和主持的。日本、南朝鲜傀儡集团、南越傀儡集团、台湾蒋介石集团、“马来西亚”、泰国、菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰的代表出席了会议。老挝万象当局也派观察员参加。
    种种迹象表明，美国企图通过这次会议在政治、经济、军事上把它们纠集在一起，结成一个矛头指向中国的反共军事联盟，并利用这次会议来为美国在越南的侵略战争服务。
    在十四日的会议上，一些与会“代表”发出了狂热的反共反华叫嚣。朴正熙在开幕式上大叫什么“在同国际共产主义摊牌中，使用武力是必要的和不可避免的”。担任会议“主席”的李东元鼓吹会议参加者为反对所谓“共产党威胁而斗争”。南朝鲜“代表”朴忠勋在会上鼓吹成立“有效的地区性组织”以进行“全面合作”，就“一切共同关心的问题”进行更经常的接触和协商，并且露骨地要亚洲国家参加美国侵略越南的战争。蒋帮的代表魏道明也在会上叫嚷反共。
