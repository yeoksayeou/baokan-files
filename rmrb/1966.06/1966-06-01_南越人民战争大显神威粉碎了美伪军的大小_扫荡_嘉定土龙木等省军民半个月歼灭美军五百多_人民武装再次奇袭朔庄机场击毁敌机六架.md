    On May 17th, the Bac Lieu Provincial Liberation Armed Forces attacked a company of puppet troops "sweeping" Khanh Hoa Commune, Vinh Chau District, while simultaneously intercepting enemy reinforcements, annihilating over 230 enemies and shooting down one enemy helicopter.
    The news agency also reported that on May 21st, the Ca Mau Provincial Liberation Armed Forces razed the enemy district Cai garrison, completely annihilating the puppet troops stationed there, and seizing all weapons and military supplies.
