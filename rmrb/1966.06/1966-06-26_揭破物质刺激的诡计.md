    Exposing the Tricks of Material Incentives
    In the three years that Kuang Yaming was at Nanjing University, he did his utmost to promote the revisionist line of material incentives, expand the three major differences, compete with the proletariat for the younger generation, and prepare conditions for the restoration of capitalism.
    Three years ago, Kuang Yaming's first report at Nanjing University was a manifesto for material incentives. As soon as he talked about Nanjing University, he expressed great dissatisfaction with the existing teaching and living conditions. Therefore, he immediately applied to the central government for funds to demolish all the original thatched houses, carry out large-scale construction, build teaching buildings, dormitory buildings, pave asphalt roads, and also vigorously promoted the construction of beautiful gymnasiums, reading rooms, swimming pools, and so on. He also readily complied with the material demands of professors and lecturers. While newspapers and periodicals across the country were reducing royalties, Kuang Yaming increased the royalties for the "Nanjing University Journal" by twenty percent. When engaging in the socialist education movement in Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province, Kuang Yaming did not educate the commune members to work hard, build the commune diligently and thriftily, and run the household diligently and thriftily, but instead spoke at length about "When there is a good harvest, we can build new thatched houses this year and next year, and new tiled houses the year after, and buy bicycles and radios." It is very clear that Kuang Yaming was using the name of "improving" educational and production conditions to actually instill the revisionist ideology of material incentives into the vast number of teachers, students, and commune members.
    In February of this year, teachers and students from the Political, Chinese, and History departments of Nanjing University actively responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, determined to go to Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, to engage in part-farming and part-study, and take the revolutionary road of integrating with the vast number of workers and peasants. At the mobilization meeting for the participation of liberal arts teachers and students in part-farming and part-study, Kuang Yaming said that Liyang's "orchard scenery is good, it is truly an idyllic paradise, the air is fresh, and there are peaches, pears, and apples, eating them will guarantee that each of you will live twenty years longer." Obviously, Kuang Yaming did not want us to truly take the road of labor and revolution, and become successors to the proletarian revolution, but used "idyllic paradise" and "prolonging life" as bait to make us become leisurely and content, "enjoying ourselves" feudal scholar-bureaucrats.
    The liberal arts teachers and students, with revolutionary determination, firmly stated that they would walk two hundred li to the Liyang branch school, without making any personal demands. However, Kuang Yaming was very "generous," giving each person a pair of "Liberation shoes" and a food allowance of as much as 1.65 yuan per person per day during the journey. The students believed that this was not in line with the spirit of hard work, plain living, and thrift and economy taught to us by Chairman Mao, and unanimously requested a reduction in the food standards during the journey. After repeated requests from the students, the food allowance during the journey was still as high as one yuan per person per day. After arriving in Liyang, Kuang Yaming, in order to "care" about the lives of the masses, extracted a portion of funds from the construction costs without obtaining the approval of the higher-level leadership, and implemented a policy of "uniformly" eating without paying, and increased the monthly food standard per person from the original 13.5 yuan to 15.5 yuan. In the orchard, some teachers received more comfortable and spacious rooms than in Nanjing. Even more blatant was that Kuang Yaming asked the students several times what requirements they had in terms of living (such as accommodation, etc.), and encouraged the students to make excessive demands on the higher-level leaders. He said, "If I were a student, I would definitely make many demands on the school leaders." See! This is how Kuang Yaming attempted to open a gap in life, corrode and win over revolutionary youth, and undermine the Party's part-work and part-study, part-farming and part-study education system.
    These facts show that Kuang Yaming's set of material incentives is entirely of the same ilk as Khrushchev's revisionism. He attempted to corrupt the revolutionary will of the youth through material incentives, oppose Mao Zedong Thought taking command, and make us successors to the bourgeoisie. In the face of the vast number of revolutionary teachers and students armed with Mao Zedong Thought, Kuang Yaming's counter-revolutionary tricks were exposed without reservation, and he ended up in a shameful end!

    揭破物质刺激的诡计
    匡亚明到南京大学三年来，竭力推行物质刺激的修正主义路线，扩大三大差别，跟无产阶级争夺青年一代，为资本主义复辟准备条件。
    三年前，匡亚明在南京大学作的第一次报告，就是一篇物质刺激的宣言书。他一谈南大，就对现有的教学条件和生活条件大为不满。因此，他马上向中央申请拨款，将原有草房全部拆除，大兴土木，盖教学大楼、宿舍大楼，铺柏油马路，还大肆宣扬要盖漂亮的体育馆、阅览室、游泳池，等等。对于教授、讲师提出的物质享受也是有求必应。在全国各报刊降低稿费的情况下，匡亚明却将《南京大学学报》的稿费提高百分之二十。在江苏海安县搞社会主义教育运动的时候，匡亚明不是向社员进行艰苦奋斗、勤俭办社、勤俭持家的教育，而是大讲特讲什么“丰收了，今年明年可盖新草房，后年盖新瓦房，买自行车、收音机了。”很清楚，匡亚明是借“改善”教育条件和生产条件之名，行向广大师生和社员群众灌输物质刺激的修正主义思想之实。
    今年二月，南京大学政治、中文、历史三系师生积极响应党和毛主席的号召，决心到江苏溧阳县搞半农半读，走与广大工农群众相结合的革命道路。在文科师生参加半农半读的动员大会上，匡亚明说什么溧阳“果园风景好，真是个世外桃源，空气新鲜，又有桃子、梨子、苹果，吃下去后，保证你们每人多活二十年”。显而易见，匡亚明不是要我们真正走劳动化革命化的道路，成为无产阶级革命接班人，而是用“世外桃源”和“延年益寿”作为诱饵，要我们成为悠然自得，“乐在其中”的封建士大夫式的文人。
    文科师生怀着革命化的决心，坚决表示，要步行二百里到溧阳分校，没有提出什么个人要求。可是，匡亚明非常“慷慨”，每人发一双“解放鞋”，每人每天途中伙食费补助高达一元六角五分。同学们认为这不符合毛主席教导我们的艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的精神，一致要求降低途中伙食标准。在同学们的再三要求下，途中伙食费还高达每人每天一元。到溧阳后，匡亚明为了“关心”群众生活，没有征得上级领导同意，擅自从基建费中抽出一部分资金，实行“一律”吃饭不要钱，并把每人每月伙食标准从原来的十三元五角提高到十五元五角。在果园，有些教师得到了比在南京更舒适更宽敞的房间。更露骨的是，匡亚明好几次问同学在生活上有什么要求（如住宿等），怂恿同学们向上级领导提出过高的要求。他说：“如果我是学生，我一定要向学校领导提出很多要求。”看！匡亚明就是这样企图从生活上打开缺口，腐蚀拉拢革命青年，破坏党的半工半读、半农半读教育制度。
    这些事实，表明了匡亚明所搞的物质刺激的一套和赫鲁晓夫修正主义完全是一路货色。他企图通过物质刺激，腐蚀青年的革命意志，反对毛泽东思想挂帅，使我们成为资产阶级的接班人。在用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命师生面前，匡亚明的反革命诡计暴露无遗，落得了可耻的下场！
