    Look, this is the "hero" praised by the poisonous weed film "Sailing Against the Wind for Thousands of Miles"!
    This photo was taken in Linjiang in November 1946. The four guys sitting in the photo are the captured Kuomintang officers of the 25th Division of the Chiang bandit army, who were annihilated by our Northeast Democratic Allied Army's Fourth Column in the Xin'kailing area. They are also the "heroes" of the Chiang bandit army praised in the poisonous weed film "Sailing Against the Wind for Thousands of Miles." Look at these prisoners, where is the "majesty" shown in the film! The one marked with "×" in the photo is Li Zhengyi, the commander of the enemy's 25th Division.

    看，这就是《逆风千里》吹捧的“英雄”！
    这张照片是一九四六年十一月间在临江拍摄的。照片中坐着的那四个家伙，就是被我东北民主联军第四纵队在新开岭地区歼灭的蒋匪军二十五师的俘虏军官，也就是毒草影片《逆风千里》中所吹捧的蒋匪军的“英雄”。请看这些俘虏，哪里有影片中所表现的那种“威风”呢！照片中画“×”的，即敌二十五师师长李正谊。
