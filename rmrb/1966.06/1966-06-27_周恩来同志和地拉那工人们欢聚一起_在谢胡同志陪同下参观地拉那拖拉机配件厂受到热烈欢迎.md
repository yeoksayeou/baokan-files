Premier Zhou Enlai and the Workers of Tirana Gather Together
Accompanied by Comrade Shehu, Premier Zhou Enlai Visits the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory and is Warmly Welcomed

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 25th - The leader of the Chinese Party and Government delegation, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mu. Shehu, visited the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory in the afternoon of the 25th and was warmly welcomed by all the workers of the factory.

Premier Zhou Enlai was warmly welcomed by the director of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory, Candidate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania Pi. Piristri, and the responsible persons of the Party, administration, trade union, youth league, women's federation, and other organizations of the factory, as well as the representative of the Chinese experts. Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands with them warmly. Young female workers presented flowers to Premier Zhou Enlai.

When Premier Zhou Enlai entered the workshop, the workers and cadres who were working enthusiastically applauded and cheered for him.

Premier Zhou Enlai listened to the introduction of the factory director and the heads of various workshops about the factory's production situation and watched the workers' operations. In the workshop, he also had cordial conversations and handshakes with some veteran workers and young male and female workers, praising their good work.

This modern factory is one of the projects assisted by China in the construction of Albania. Construction began in July 1963, and through the joint efforts of experts from both China and Albania and the Albanian workers, it has now been basically completed and has begun partial trial production. After the factory is fully completed, it will be able to produce 416 kinds of products, which will play a significant role in promoting the mechanization of Albania's agriculture.

At the end of the visit, Director Piristri expressed his gratitude for China's assistance in building this factory and praised the work of the Chinese experts.

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "Assistance is mutual; you have also assisted us." He also said, "Nothing can be said to be perfect; there will always be shortcomings and mistakes. We must analyze them dialectically, find the shortcomings and mistakes, and correct them, so that we can make progress. He said that Albanian comrades should not only praise the equipment provided by China and the work of Chinese experts but also criticize them. This is the revolutionary friendship, this is the real unity based on Marxism-Leninism." Premier Zhou Enlai also encouraged the Chinese experts to work better with the Albanian comrades.

Later, Director Piristri, on behalf of all the workers of the factory, presented the products they produced to Premier Zhou Enlai as a souvenir, and Premier Zhou Enlai also presented gifts to the factory.

Premier Zhou Enlai's visit brought joy and encouragement to the workers of this factory. The head of the mechanical processing workshop, Perpanim, said: "This is Premier Zhou's third visit to Albania. His visit will further strengthen the fraternal friendship between the peoples of Albania and China and will be another heavy blow to imperialism and revisionism. This time he came to visit our factory, which is a great honor and great encouragement for all the workers of our factory. We will respond to his warm concern with better production results."

Today, the factory inside and outside presented a festive atmosphere. Countless flags of the two countries and red flags were hung on the streets leading to the factory and inside the factory. Many banners and slogans read: "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong," "Long live Marxism-Leninism," "Long live the fighting unity of the two parties of Albania and China," and so on. On the main building of the factory, there were large portraits of the great leaders of the peoples of the two countries, Mao Zedong and Comrade Hoxha, and on both sides of the portraits, there were prominent slogans reading: "Long live the Communist Party of China with Comrade Mao Zedong as its leader," "Long live the Party of Labour of Albania with Comrade Enver Hoxha as its leader." In the workshops of the factory, each machine was decorated with the flags of the two countries.

When Premier Zhou Enlai left the factory, all the workers came out of the workshops and offices to warmly and reluctantly see off the Chinese guests. People kept waving bouquets and the flags of the two countries, enthusiastically shouting: "Enver Hoxha—Mao Zedong."

Members of the Chinese Party and Government delegation Zhao Yimin and Qiao Guanhua, as well as other members of the delegation, also visited the factory.

Those who accompanied the Chinese guests on the visit included: Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania S. Kolega, Candidate Member of the Political Bureau, Minister of Industry and Mines K. Theodhori, Chairman of the Albania-China Friendship Association, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the People's Assembly of Tirana A. Kellezi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Albania N.

    周恩来同志和地拉那工人们欢聚一起
    在谢胡同志陪同下参观地拉那拖拉机配件厂受到热烈欢迎
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　中国党政代表团团长、中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来同志，二十五日下午在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议主席穆·谢胡同志陪同下，参观了地拉那拖拉机配件厂，受到全厂职工极热烈欢迎。
    周恩来同志在工厂门前受到拖拉机配件厂厂长、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局候补委员皮·皮里斯特里和工厂的党、行政、工会、青年联盟、妇女联合会等组织的负责人以及中国专家代表的热烈欢迎。周恩来同志同他们亲切握手。青年女工向周恩来同志献了花。
    周恩来同志走进厂房时，正在生产的工人和干部向他热烈鼓掌和欢呼。
    周恩来同志听取了工厂厂长、各车间主任关于工厂生产情况的介绍，观看了工人们的操作。他在车间里还同一些老工人和青年男女工人亲切交谈、握手，赞扬他们工作得好。
    这个现代化的工厂是中国援助阿尔巴尼亚建设的项目之一，从一九六三年七月开始动工，经过中阿两国专家和阿尔巴尼亚工人共同的努力，现在已经基本建成，并且开始部分试生产。工厂在全部建成后，将可以生产四百一十六种产品，对促进阿尔巴尼亚的农业机械化将起重大的作用。
    参观结束时，皮里斯特里厂长对中国援助阿尔巴尼亚建筑这个工厂表示感谢，并赞扬中国专家的工作。
    周恩来同志说，援助是相互的，你们也援助了我们。他还说，任何事情都不能说十全十美，总会有缺点和错误。我们要一分为二，有缺点和错误，要检查改正，这样才能进步。他说，阿尔巴尼亚同志对中国提供的设备和中国专家的工作不能只表扬，也要批评，这才是革命的友谊，这才是在马克思列宁主义基础上的真正团结。周恩来同志并勉励中国专家同阿尔巴尼亚同志一起更好地工作。
    随后，皮里斯特里厂长代表全厂职工把他们生产的产品送给周恩来同志留念，周恩来同志也向工厂赠送了礼物。
    周恩来同志的参观，给这个工厂的职工带来了欢乐和鼓舞。机械加工车间主任佩尔帕尼姆说：“这是周总理第三次访问阿尔巴尼亚，他的访问必将更加加强阿中两国人民亲如骨肉的友谊，对帝国主义和修正主义是又一次沉重的打击。这次他来参观我们工厂，对我们全厂职工是莫大的荣幸和巨大的鼓舞。我们将以更好的生产成绩回答他的亲切的关怀。”
    今天，工厂内外呈现出一派热烈的节日景象。在通往工厂的街道上和工厂里挂起了无数面中阿两国国旗和红旗，许多标语牌和横幅上面写着：“毛泽东同志万岁”、“马克思列宁主义万岁”、“阿中两党的战斗团结万岁”等口号。在工厂主要厂房上悬挂着中阿两国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和霍查同志的巨幅画象，在画象的两旁还悬挂着写有“以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党万岁”、“以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁”的醒目的标语牌。在工厂的车间里，每台机器都插上了中阿两国的国旗。
    周恩来同志离开工厂时，全厂职工走出车间和办公室，热烈地、依依不舍地欢送中国贵宾。人们不断地挥舞花束和中阿两国国旗，热情高呼：“恩维尔·霍查—毛泽东”。
    中国党政代表团团员赵毅敏和乔冠华以及代表团的其他同志也到工厂参观。
    陪同中国贵宾参观的还有：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员斯·科列加，政治局候补委员、工业和矿业部长科·蒂奥多西，阿中友协主席、地拉那市人民会议执行委员会主席阿·凯莱齐，阿尔巴尼亚外交部长奈·纳赛，阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦·纳塔奈利，以及其他有关部门的负责人。
    中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办王锦川和其他外交官员也陪同前往参观。（附图片）
