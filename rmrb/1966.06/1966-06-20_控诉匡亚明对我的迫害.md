    Accusation Against Kuang Yaming's Persecution of Me
    Hu Caiji, Fifth-Grade Student of the Chinese Department, Nanjing University Liyang Branch
    I want to accuse Kuang Yaming of his counter-revolutionary crimes of cruelly persecuting us.
    I am a graduating student in the fifth grade of the Chinese Department. During this Great Cultural Revolution, I and my classmates rose up to expose problems concerning a certain editor's note. This editor's note was a revisionist program concocted single-handedly by Kuang Yaming to resist the Great Cultural Revolution. Our exposure struck at his vital point and touched his sore spot. With his extremely reactionary political sensitivity, he sensed that a breach had been opened, that the anti-Party capital he had painstakingly built up over many years could not be preserved, and so he frantically counterattacked, attempting to strangle the revolutionary forces in the Liyang orchard.
    On June 2nd, when we wrote the first letter of opinion and posted the first batch of big-character posters, Kuang Yaming, this bourgeois "authority," flew into a rage, his manner fierce and murderous, wishing he could swallow us whole. Less than two hours after our big-character posters were put up, he convened a meeting to plot counter-revolutionary conspiracies, adopting the tactics of utilizing one group, luring another, and deceiving yet another, clamoring to unify understanding, strengthen unity, and jointly confront the enemy. After they had plotted, they convened a Party member meeting that evening, further conducting counter-revolutionary mobilization. He used his confidants as megaphones, praising him as a "great proletarian revolutionary," claiming that his editor's note was Marxist-Leninist, completely correct, and slandering our big-character posters as "having ulterior motives," "creating chaos," and "diverting the goals of the Great Cultural Revolution." Kuang Yaming also reversed black and white, fearing nothing more than that the world would not be in chaos, fearing nothing more than failing to strike hard enough at the revolutionary teachers and students. After a series of ideological and organizational plottings, he stirred up trouble everywhere, wantonly slandering comrades who wrote big-character posters. This anti-Party schemer, who had a habit of "going to bed early," at this time, stayed up late, pacing back and forth in front of the big-character posters, falsely accusing our big-character posters as "poison arrows" and "poisonous weeds," and slandering us as "counter-revolutionaries," "chief culprits," and "not even as good as reactionaries." He also tried his best to incite students, asking them to "sharpen their eyes," rise up to "defend Principal Kuang," "defend the political office," and rise up to counterattack "anti-Party and anti-socialist elements."
    On the morning of June 3rd, the meeting to struggle against us had already been planned, but he was still not reassured and personally directed it. When he rushed to participate in the struggle meeting against me, before anyone else had spoken, he said to me viciously: "Hu Caiji, you have played the role of a negative example well, you are very clever." He also said to the students: "Hu Caiji is the boss of the 'Three-Family Village' black shop, his counter-revolutionary stand is as firm as Deng Tuo's, you must not underestimate him!" He did not allow other students to debate, but turned to me with extremely hostile eyes, and said fiercely: "You yourself must not underestimate yourself either." Under his instigation, some people who did not know the truth besieged me, shouting the slogan "Open fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist element Hu Caiji!" In the short two days from the 3rd to the 4th, they conducted four cruel struggles against me. They started up the propaganda machine, broadcasting articles slandering me all day long, wrote hundreds of big-character posters slandering me, and put various big hats on me, such as "anti-Party and anti-socialist commander and mastermind," "consistently anti-Party," and "insidious and vicious." They sent people to monitor me, depriving me of my freedom of speech and action, slandering the group I was in as a "black group" and a "revisionist clique," forcing me to confess "anti-Party and anti-socialist" black words year by year and month by month. They also subjected me to crude personal insults, conducted "attitude rectification," and clamored to take me to a school-wide meeting to be struggled against.
    Kuang Yaming thought it was not enough to put the hat of an anti-Party and anti-socialist element on me, but also fabricated rumors and slanders, politically framing me. The first big-character poster against me was personally dictated by Kuang Yaming. This big-character poster slandered me as a Kuomintang member, a Three Youth League member, and a class alien. I used to be the chairman of the Nanjing University Student Union, and Kuang Yaming was familiar with me. Just a few days before he struggled against me, he personally went to our dormitory and shook hands with me. However, just a few days later, he slandered me as a Kuomintang member, a Three Youth League member, and a class alien. Why is this? Now I understand. In the past, because I did not recognize his reactionary face, he fantasized that I would be his accomplice and pawn in his anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Now, his fantasy about me has been shattered, and I am going to expose his problems, so he is conducting frantic political persecution and ruthless retaliation against me.
    Kuang Yaming not only cruelly persecuted me, but he also clamored that any Communist Party member who had written big-character posters would be expelled from the Party, and the older the Party member, the more they should be held onto and not let go. Kuang Yaming, why do you hate Communist Party members so much?
    Kuang Yaming wanted to struggle us to death and drag us out of the orchard like wild dogs. How firm his counter-revolutionary stand is, and how stubborn his attitude of attacking revolutionaries and framing comrades! However, Kuang Yaming's counter-revolutionary atrocities were quickly exposed by the Provincial Party Committee. The Party rescued me from Kuang Yaming's clutches, the Party supported us, and the Party's brilliance illuminated the Liyang branch, making me feel from personal experience the greatness, glory, and correctness of our Party.
    Our struggle against Kuang Yaming is a life-and-death class struggle! With the support of the Party and with the great Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, where can Kuang Yaming and all the monsters and demons escape! Under the correct leadership of the Party, and under the illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, all of us teachers and students who are willing to make revolution unite, and we will never stop until Kuang Yaming is overthrown and discredited! We will never stop until all the monsters and demons in Nanjing University are dragged out! We will never stop until the Cultural Revolution is carried through to the end!

### 控诉匡亚明对我的迫害

    控诉匡亚明对我的迫害
    南京大学溧阳分校中文系五年级学生　胡才基
    我要控诉匡亚明残酷迫害我们的反革命罪行。
    我是中文系五年级毕业班的学生。在这次文化大革命中，我和班上同学起来揭发关于一个按语中的问题。这个按语是匡亚明一手炮制的一个对抗文化大革命的修正主义纲领。我们的揭发，打中了他的要害，触到他的痛处。他以他极端反动的政治敏感感到缺口被打开了，多年苦心经营的反党资本保不住了，于是便疯狂地进行反扑，企图把革命力量扼杀在溧阳果园。
    六月二日，当我们写了第一封意见书，贴出了第一批大字报时，匡亚明这个资产阶级“权威”就暴跳如雷，气势汹汹，杀气腾腾，恨不得把我们一口吞下肚去。我们的大字报贴出后还不到两小时，他就召开了策划反革命阴谋的会议，采取利用一批人，拉拢一批人，欺骗一批人的手法，扬言要统一认识，加强团结，共同对敌。他们策划好了，在当晚又召开党员大会，进一步进行反革命动员。他利用他的心腹做传声筒，吹捧他是“伟大的无产阶级革命家”，他所写的按语是马列主义的，是完全正确的，诬蔑我们写大字报是“别有用心”、“制造混乱”、“转移文化大革命的目标”。匡亚明还颠倒黑白，唯恐天下不乱，唯恐对革命师生打击不力，在经过一系列的思想上、组织上的策划以后，又四处煽风点火，肆意诬蔑写大字报的同志。这个有“早睡”习惯的反党阴谋家，此时，深夜不睡，在大字报跟前转来转去，诬指我们的大字报是“毒箭”“毒草”，诬蔑我们是“反革命”，是“罪魁祸首”，“连反动派都不如”。他还竭力煽动同学，要他们“擦亮眼睛”，起来“保卫匡校长”“保卫政治处”，起来向“反党反社会主义分子”回击。
    六月三日早晨，斗争我们的会已事先策划好了，他还不放心，还亲自动手指挥。他赶来参加对我的斗争会时，其他人还没有发言，他先恶狠狠地对我说：“胡才基，你这个反面教员充当得好啊，你很高明。”他又对同学说：“胡才基是‘三家村’黑店的老板，他的反革命立场象邓拓一样坚定，你们千万不要轻估他啊！”他不容其他同学辩论，又转过头来以极端仇视的目光对着我，凶狠地说：“你自己也不要轻估了自己。”在他的煽动下，一些不明真相的人便群起对我围攻，高呼“向反党反社会主义分子胡才基开火”的口号。从三日到四日的短短两天中，他们对我进行了四次残酷的斗争。他们开动宣传机器，整天广播诬蔑我的稿件，写了上百张诬蔑我的大字报，给我戴上“反党反社会主义主帅、主谋”、“一贯反党”“阴险毒辣”等各种各样的大帽子。他们派人对我进行监视，剥夺我的言论和行动自由，诬蔑我所在的小组是“黑组”，是“修正主义集团”，逼我按年按月交代“反党反社会主义”黑话。他们还对我进行粗暴的人身侮辱，进行“整态度”，扬言要拿到全校大会上去斗。
    匡亚明给我戴上反党反社会主义分子的帽子还不够，还要造谣中伤，从政治上对我进行陷害。贴我的第一张大字报，是匡亚明亲自口授的，这张大字报诬蔑我是国民党员、三青团员、是阶级异己分子。我过去是南京大学学生会主席，匡亚明对我是熟悉的，就在他斗我的前几天，他还亲自到我们寝室去过，还跟我握手。可是，就在几天以后，他诬蔑我是国民党员、三青团员、是阶级异己分子，这是为什么？现在我清楚了，以前因为我没认清他的反动面目，他幻想我会做他的反党反社会主义的帮凶和爪牙。现在，他对我的幻想破灭了，我要揭发他的问题了，所以便对我进行疯狂的政治迫害，和无情的打击报复。
    匡亚明不仅对我残酷迫害，他还扬言，共产党员凡是写过大字报的，一律开除党籍，越是老的党员，越要扭住不放。匡亚明，你为什么对共产党员这样仇视？
    匡亚明要把我们斗死，象野狗一样拖出果园。他的反革命的立场是多么坚定，他打击革命、陷害同志的态度，多么顽强！但是，匡亚明的反革命暴行很快就被省委所揭穿。党把我从匡亚明的魔爪下拯救出来，党给我们撑了腰，党的光辉照亮了溧阳分校，使我从亲身体会中感到我们党的伟大、光荣、正确。
    我们对匡亚明的斗争，是你死我活的阶级斗争！我们有党的支持，有伟大的毛泽东思想作武器，匡亚明和一切牛鬼蛇神，你们往那里逃！在党的正确领导下，在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，我们全体愿意革命的师生团结起来，不斗倒、斗臭匡亚明决不收兵！不把南京大学的一切牛鬼蛇神全部揪出来决不收兵！不把文化大革命进行到底决不收兵！
