    After seeing the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," I thought about the past and understood today's happiness even more. My enthusiasm for production is even greater, and I must use practical actions to build and defend the new society. Therefore, I think such good shows should be written and performed more often. It can remind us not to forget the deep hatred of the past, so that we can see further, see that we still have the responsibility to build socialism and carry out the socialist revolution on a large scale, and the obligation to help class brothers all over the world achieve liberation.

    I can understand the large-scale revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl," and I love to watch it. Xi'er's suffering is my suffering, and Xi'er's joy is my joy. I have also become one of the people on the stage. It makes me remember the suffering of the old society and love today's happiness even more. The song in the seventh scene, "The sun is out... the sun is Mao Zedong, the sun is the Communist Party," is exactly the song I want to sing in my heart.

    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" expresses the tragic experiences of our working people in the old society and their tenacious struggle against the landlord class. The actors perform vividly and are full of class feelings, which greatly enhances the revolutionary spirit of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

    Some people say that ballet cannot express the revolutionary struggle of the working people. The performance of "The White-Haired Girl" proves that this statement is wrong. After seeing the play, I deeply realized that this is the victory of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art. I hope that comrades engaged in ballet will make greater achievements under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought!

    While watching the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," I thought: The teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School have studied Chairman Mao's works well. Their adaptation and performance of this play has no rigid copying or imitation at all, but is full of creation and innovation. Mao Zedong Thought works wonders wherever it is applied. Performing plays and engaging in music and dance must also be done in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. Anything that is adapted, rehearsed, and performed in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions will be applauded and welcomed by the audience, because the play is performed for us workers, peasants, and soldiers, and we workers, peasants, and soldiers love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao the most.

    Now the ballet is making revolution, performing about us workers, peasants, and soldiers, and there are people singing along below. We can understand it, so we love to watch it and think it's meaningful. We hope to see more of such good ballets. Such plays are educational for everyone and can boost morale. It also educates us not to forget the past, educates us to honestly listen to Chairman Mao, wholeheartedly serve the people, and let the revolutionary red flag in our hands be raised higher and higher and never change color.

    The ballets of the past were all about foreign young masters and young ladies talking about love, which we workers hated completely. The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is different. It tells the story of our class sisters, the daughters of poor peasants, suffering oppression and exploitation in the old society, and sings the joyous mood of the Party and Chairman Mao calling on us poor people to stand up and be masters of our own affairs. Therefore, it feels particularly intimate and particularly exciting.

    The reason why the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers is because they have spoken for the workers, peasants, and soldiers from the standpoint of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and expressed the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    工农兵谈芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》
    看了芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，我想起了过去，也更懂得了今天的幸福，在生产上干劲就更足，更要用实际行动来建设新社会，保卫新社会。所以，我觉得这样的好戏，应该多编多演。它能叫我们不忘记过去的深仇大恨。好叫自己眼光看得更远，看到自己还有建设社会主义、大搞社会主义革命的责任，还有帮助全世界阶级弟兄取得解放的义务。上海国棉七厂老工人许小妹

    大型革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，我看得懂，我很爱看。喜儿的苦就是我的苦，喜儿的乐就是我的乐，我也成了舞台上的人了。它使我重新记起了旧社会的苦难，更热爱幸福的今天。第七场的那首歌“太阳出来了，……太阳就是毛泽东，太阳就是共产党”，正是我心里所要唱的歌。解放军某部班长安郁渠

    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，表现了我们劳动人民在旧社会里的悲惨遭遇和对地主阶级进行的顽强斗争，演员们演得又生动，又充满阶级感情，大长了我们贫下中农的革命志气。
    有人说，芭蕾舞不能表现劳动人民的革命斗争，《白毛女》的演出证明这种说法是错误的。看过戏以后，我深深体会到：这是毛泽东文艺思想的胜利。希望从事芭蕾舞的同志们，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，作出更大的成绩！　上海青浦县徐泾公社社员　裘云龙

    我一边看芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，一边在想：上海市舞蹈学校的师生，学习毛主席著作学得好。他们编演这出戏，没有一点硬搬和模仿，有的是创造和革新。毛泽东思想用到哪里哪里灵。演戏，搞音乐舞蹈也要按毛主席的指示办事。凡是按毛主席的指示去编戏、排戏、演戏，观众就会鼓掌欢迎。因为戏是演给我们工农兵看的，而我们工农兵最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。

    现在芭蕾舞闹革命了，演的是我们工农兵，又有人在下面唱，我们看得懂，就爱看，觉得它有意思。希望多演这样的好舞剧。这样的戏，对大家有教育作用，能鼓干劲。它还教育我们千万不能忘记过去，教育我们老老实实听毛主席的话，一心一意为人民服务，让我们手中的革命红旗越举越高，永不变色。

    过去的芭蕾舞尽演洋少爷、洋小姐谈情说爱，我们工人压根儿讨厌。芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》就不同，它演的是咱们的阶级姐妹、贫农的女儿喜儿在旧社会受压迫、受剥削的血泪仇，唱出了党和毛主席叫咱们穷人翻身、当家作主的喜悦心情，所以感到特别亲切，特别激动。

    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》所以受工农兵的欢迎，就是因为他们站在工农兵的立场上为工农兵说了话，抒发了工农兵的思想感情。　		解放军某部战士　方熊
