    Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau meeting opened in Beijing this afternoon. The meeting's agenda is to discuss the preparatory work for the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting scheduled to be held in Beijing on June 27th of this year.

    Representatives from the Permanent Bureau member countries, including Cameroon, Ceylon, China, Ghana, Indonesia, Japan, and Sudan, attended today's meeting.

    The meeting was presided over by Mr. Mannikkuwela, the representative from Ceylon, representing the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, Mr. Senanayake.

    In his speech, Mr. Mannikkuwela warmly welcomed the representatives from various countries attending this Permanent Bureau meeting. He pointed out that the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting is being convened to discuss issues such as the Afro-Asian writers' support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression. The Vietnamese people's struggle proves that there is no force in the world that can defeat people who are fighting for independence and freedom. The Vietnamese people's struggle also clearly shows that those who do not support, but actually undermine this struggle, are fake revolutionaries. They have betrayed the revolutionary people. Mr. Mannikkuwela said that the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting will be conducted in the most democratic manner and will surely be a complete success.

    Chinese representative Yang Shuo reported at the meeting on the preparatory work done by China, as the host of the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting. He emphasized that the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting is being convened at a time when China is in the high tide of the Great Cultural Revolution. In this vigorous revolutionary movement, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are sweeping away all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and creating new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, some of the plays, music, fine arts, films, and other works created by Chinese literary and art workers will be shown to the representatives for viewing and appreciation, and it is hoped that the representatives from various countries will provide their opinions.

    The representatives from various countries attending the meeting then engaged in discussions. Representatives from seven countries unanimously agreed that the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting should be held in Beijing as scheduled, expressed satisfaction with the preparatory work, and wished the meeting a complete success.

    Sudanese representative Osman Hassan Ahmed pointed out in his speech that the current world situation is favorable to the revolutionary people. U.S. imperialism and those so-called "revolutionaries" are doing everything possible to suppress and oppose the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries. They are using decadent works to poison the people of various countries on the cultural front. We Afro-Asian writers must be vigilant, take a clear stand, and smash all the conspiracies of imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries. We must actively support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and the people of all countries.

    Indonesian representative Agam Wispi stated in his speech that the convening of the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting is not only a strong support for the Vietnamese people's struggle but also a great support for the revolutionary people of Indonesia. He expressed that the Indonesian delegation will do its utmost to contribute to the success of this meeting.

    The Ghanaian representative said in his speech that we support the convening of the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting one hundred percent. The people of Ghana need this meeting more than many other countries. He said that the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting will certainly be a success.

    Japanese representative Yoshikata Yoda pointed out in his speech that Japan is still in a subordinate position to the United States today, and there are many U.S. imperialist invasion bases established on Japanese territory. In Japan, not only is U.S. imperialism carrying out cultural aggression, but modern revisionism is also actively carrying out cultural aggression. Japanese writers have a responsibility to fight against the cultural aggression of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism.

    Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, held a banquet this evening to welcome the representatives from various countries who came to Beijing to attend the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau meeting.

    Liao Chengzhi and Mr. Mannikkuwela (Ceylon), representative of Mr. Senanayake, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, spoke at the banquet.

    On behalf of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Liao Chengzhi warmly welcomed friends from Afro-Asian countries to Beijing to attend the Permanent Bureau meeting. He wished the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau meeting and the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting success and proposed a toast to the unity and friendship of the people and writers of Afro-Asian countries.

    In his speech, Mannikkuwela expressed his deep belief that the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting will be a success. He said that more than forty countries have been invited to participate in the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting to be held in Beijing soon. This clearly demonstrates the support and sympathy of Afro-Asian writers for the Vietnamese people's struggle. No one, no force, can stop us from moving forward, neither U.S. imperialism and its pawns nor those hypocritical fake revolutionaries can stop us from moving forward.

    Also invited to attend the banquet were the representatives from Cameroon, Ghana, Indonesia, Japan, and Sudan who participated in the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau meeting, as well as some foreign representatives who had already arrived in Beijing to prepare for the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting.

    Also invited to attend the banquet were Djawoto, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, Tran Van Thanh, head of the Permanent Mission of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front to China, and foreign friends in Beijing, including Anna Louise Strong, Kinkazu Saionji, Prasong Chulanond, Sharma, Garbu, and Willie Hariandja.

    Also attending today's banquet were responsible persons from various Chinese people's organizations and figures from literary and art circles, including Chu Tunan, Li Qi, Qian Liren, Wang Chuanbin, Wang Yunsheng, Ba Jin, Liu Baiyu, Yang Shuo, Zhu Ziqi, Yan Wenjing, Yu Ji, Lin Lin, Du Xuan, Hu Wanchun, and Han Beiping. After the banquet, the representatives from various countries attended a literary and art soiree and watched song and dance programs performed by the Chinese Folk Song and Dance Troupe reflecting the anti-imperialist struggles of the Afro-Asian people.

    亚非作家常设局会议在北京开幕
    各国代表强调支持越南人民反对美帝侵略的斗争
    廖承志举行宴会热烈欢迎参加会议的各国朋友们
    新华社九日讯　亚非作家常设局会议今天下午在北京开幕。会议议程是讨论定于今年六月二十七日在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议的筹备工作。
    来自喀麦隆、锡兰、中国、加纳、印度尼西亚、日本、苏丹等常设局成员国的代表，出席了今天的会议。
    会议由亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克的代表、锡兰代表曼努维拉主持。
    曼努维拉在讲话中对出席这次常设局会议的各国代表表示热烈欢迎。他指出，亚非作家紧急会议的召开，是为了讨论亚非作家支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争等问题。越南人民的斗争证明，世界上没有任何力量能战胜为独立和自由而斗争的人民。越南人民的斗争还清楚表明，那些不支持、而实际上是破坏这一斗争的人，是假革命者。他们已背叛了革命的人民。曼努维拉说，亚非作家紧急会议将采取最民主的方式进行，它定将获得圆满成功。
    中国代表杨朔在会上报告了作为亚非作家紧急会议东道主的中国为会议所作的筹备工作。他着重指出，亚非作家紧急会议的召开，正值中国处于文化大革命的高潮，在这场轰轰烈烈的大革命运动中，广大工农兵群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，扫除一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，创造新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。中国的文学艺术工作者在毛泽东文艺思想的指导下，所创作的一部分戏剧、音乐、美术、电影等作品，将请代表们观看和欣赏，希望听取各国代表的意见。
    出席会议的各国代表接着进行了讨论。七个国家的代表一致同意亚非作家紧急会议如期在北京召开，对筹备工作表示满意，并预祝会议取得圆满成功。
    苏丹代表奥斯曼·哈桑·阿赫迈德在发言中指出，目前世界形势有利于革命人民。美帝国主义和那些所谓的“革命者”千方百计镇压和反对各国人民的革命斗争，他们在文化战线上用腐朽的作品毒化各国人民。我们亚非作家必须提高警惕，采取鲜明的立场，粉碎帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的种种阴谋。积极支持越南人民和各国人民的正义斗争。
    印度尼西亚代表阿甘姆·维斯比在发言中指出，亚非作家紧急会议的召开，不仅对越南人民的斗争是强有力的支持，而且对印度尼西亚的革命人民也是极大的支持。他表示印度尼西亚代表团将为这次会议的成功竭尽全力，作出贡献。
    加纳代表在发言中说，我们百分之百地支持召开亚非作家紧急会议。加纳人民比许多国家更为需要这个会议。他说，亚非作家紧急会议一定会取得成功。
    日本代表依田义贤在发言中指出，日本今天还处在从属于美国的地位，在日本国土上建立有许多美帝国主义的侵略基地。在日本，不仅美帝国主义正在进行文化侵略，现代修正主义也在积极进行文化侵略。日本作家有责任同美帝国主义和现代修正主义的文化侵略进行斗争。
    新华社九日讯　中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志今晚举行宴会，欢迎来北京参加亚非作家常设局会议的各国代表。
    廖承志和亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克的代表曼努维拉（锡兰）在宴会上讲话。
    廖承志代表中国亚非团结委员会热烈欢迎亚非的各国朋友来北京参加常设局会议。他预祝亚非作家常设局会议和亚非作家紧急会议获得成功，并提议为亚非各国人民和作家的团结和友谊干杯。
    曼努维拉在讲话中表示深信亚非作家紧急会议一定会成功。他说，现在已经有四十多个国家应邀参加即将在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议。这清楚地表明了亚非作家对越南人民斗争的支持和同情。没有任何人没有任何力量能阻挡我们前进，不管是美帝国主义及其爪牙和那些伪善的假革命者都不能阻挡我们前进。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有参加亚非作家常设局会议的喀麦隆、加纳、印度尼西亚、日本、苏丹的代表，以及已经到北京准备参加亚非作家紧急会议的一些外国代表。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多、越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成，在北京的外国朋友斯特朗、西园寺公一、帕荣·朱拉暖、沙尔玛、加尔布、威利·哈利安查等。
    出席今天宴会的，还有我国各人民团体的负责人和文艺界人士楚图南、李琦、钱李仁、王传斌、王芸生、巴金、刘白羽、杨朔、朱子奇、严文井、虞棘、林林、杜宣、胡万春、韩北屏等。宴会以后，各国代表出席了文艺晚会，观看了中国民间歌舞团演出的反映亚非人民反帝斗争的歌舞节目。
