    Revolutionary Teachers and Students from Universities and Middle Schools in the Capital Stream Ceaselessly to the Locations of the Party Central Committee and the State Council
    Joyfully Sending Congratulatory Letters and Expressing Determination to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao
    Revolutionary Teachers and Students Express: Resolutely Listen to the Words of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Through to the End, Completely Eradicate the Bourgeois and Revisionist Education Line, Let the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought Forever Fly in the Proletarian Education Front, and Pass on Mao Zedong Thought from Generation to Generation.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th—The decision of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on reforming the college entrance examination method has received the most sincere and enthusiastic support from revolutionary teachers and students in universities and middle schools in the capital. Thousands of teachers and students are hailing another new victory for Mao Zedong Thought with extremely high revolutionary passion.
    From last night until today, batches of revolutionary teachers and students have come to the gate of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, gathering at Tiananmen Square. Here, they sent congratulatory letters and expressed their determination to the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, held celebration rallies, and delivered enthusiastic speeches full of boundless revolutionary fervor. The broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students expressed that they must resolutely listen to the words of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, completely eliminate the bourgeois and revisionist education line, let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly in the proletarian education front, and pass on Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation.
    Many students jumped up with joy after hearing the broadcast last night, clapping their hands and cheering, spreading the word: "Chairman Mao spoke the words in our hearts," "The Party Central Committee and the State Council expressed our determination to thoroughly make revolution and our common desire." That night, revolutionary teachers and students from many schools posted big-character posters supporting the reform of the college entrance examination method. Some ran from suburban areas dozens of miles away from the city to the gate of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council late at night, sending congratulatory letters and letters of determination to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Today, from morning to night, tens of thousands more revolutionary teachers and students, filled with joy, carried portraits of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, carried huge banners such as "Resolutely Be Successors to the Proletarian Revolutionary Cause," beat gongs and drums, and streamed in batches to the gate of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, and to Tiananmen Square.
    Many revolutionary teachers and students at Peking University, where the Cultural Revolution has already achieved significant victories, wrote letters to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao overnight and ran into the city to deliver them that night. The entire student body of the paleontology major in the second year of the Department of Geology and Geography at this school wrote in their letter: "Respected Party Central Committee, our most respected leader Chairman Mao: Tonight we heard the revolutionary proposal of the students of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School and Beijing No. 4 Middle School on the radio, and we express our firm support. Since the high school students want to cut off the roots of revisionism in the knowledge world, then we must completely smash all existing bourgeois educational systems and replace them with proletarian educational systems." The letter said: "In the short two years of university life, we have deeply realized that bourgeois ideology is eroding us through various channels. If we do not block these channels, the bourgeoisie may still be restored, and our country may still change color. Only by eradicating these old systems can we thoroughly transform bourgeois intellectuals, eliminate the emergence of new bourgeois spiritual aristocrats, and ensure that our party and our country will never change color. This is a century-long plan, a millennium-long plan, a ten-thousand-year plan." The students said with great excitement in the letter: "Respected Party Central Committee, our most respected leader Chairman Mao, please rest assured! The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will never be lost in our generation. We will pass it on forever from generation to generation. The bourgeois restoration conspiracy will never succeed in our generation, and they will never succeed. In our hearts, the greatest authority is you—our most great, most brilliant, and most respected leader Chairman Mao, and that is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."
    Today, many graduating senior and junior high school students and the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students from middle schools throughout the city also came in groups, singing revolutionary songs such as "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "Being Successors to the Proletarian Revolutionary Cause," to the gate of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, and to Tiananmen Square, expressing their incomparably joyful and enthusiastic revolutionary passion, and expressing their boundless love, faith, and worship for the great leader Chairman Mao. A group of students from Class 6, Grade 3 of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School wrote in a letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: We are the descendants of revolutionaries, the successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. We should be the revolutionary vanguards of the world's youth, and we should and must take the lead in smashing the old education system. Revolutionary students from Class 2, Grade 3 of Tongxian No. 1 Middle School in the suburbs said in their letter that when we heard the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on the radio, our hearts flew to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We express to the Party and Chairman Mao that we will resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, sweep away all monsters and demons, and smash the old imperial examination system. Even if it means climbing mountains of knives or plunging into seas of fire, we will forever follow the Party and Chairman Mao in making revolution, making revolution for the rest of our lives in China, and making revolution for the rest of our lives in the world.
    A person in charge of the State Council warmly received batches of revolutionary teachers and students in front of the gate of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, and told the students that he would definitely report the students' warm congratulations and determination to Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, and Premier Zhou, and encouraged them to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The students were extremely excited upon hearing this, and shouted in unison: "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Thoroughly reform the education system!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"
    Today, Tiananmen Square was filled with jubilation. Revolutionary teachers and students from many schools gathered here from all directions to hold celebration rallies. The vast square was filled with red flags, a sea of people, and singing and dancing everywhere. Teachers and students from Beijing No. 4 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, No. 6 Middle School, No. 28 Middle School, No. 41 Middle School, No. 8 Girls' Middle School, and No. 6 Girls' Middle School were among the first to arrive here in the morning. Students from Beijing No. 4 Middle School, who put forward a revolutionary proposal to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, brought a propaganda painting expressing Chairman Mao's infinite concern for the youth, "Hope is Placed on You," to participate in the celebration. Many students from Beijing No. 6 Girls' Middle School held portraits of Chairman Mao draped with red silk and large red "double happiness" characters, celebrating this great happy event. Many classes of students from Beijing No. 41 Middle School brought congratulatory messages to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to Tiananmen Square. Students from Class 3, Grade 3 of this school said in the congratulatory message: We most warmly hail the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We resolutely listen to the words of the Party and the words of Chairman Mao, brave the storms and see the world in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and grow up in the storms, vowing to be the strong descendants of the proletariat and vowing to be a new generation for the cause of communism. For the sake of our motherland's eternal immutability and for the infinitely bright future of the people of our motherland and the people of the world, we vow to carry the revolution through to the end. When more than 1,000 students from No. 28 Middle School held a celebration rally at Tiananmen Square, more than ten students competed to give speeches. The student representative from Class 9, Grade 3 said excitedly: Respected leader Chairman Mao, we are the revolutionary descendants cultivated by you. We must protect the country that the revolutionary predecessors exchanged with blood and life with our blood and life. In order to take over the revolutionary baton and pass on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we must throw ourselves into the great storms of revolution to be tempered, and we will not hesitate to be crushed to pieces. Many students from worker-peasant families shed tears, recalling the bitterness of the past and thinking about the sweetness of the present, and at Tiananmen Square, they accused the old society of depriving the laboring people of the right to master culture, and accused the bourgeois "authorities" of implementing the bourgeois education line and carrying out bourgeois dictatorship against the children of workers and peasants. They warmly hailed the wise decision of the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and expressed that they must carry the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to the end.
    Today, big-character posters celebrating the wise decision of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council were posted everywhere in many universities and middle schools in Beijing, and the revolutionary proposal of the students of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School and No. 4 Boys' Middle School was being spread and discussed everywhere. After reading the decision and the editorial of the *People's Daily*, the students of Grade 3 of Beijing No. 8 Girls' Middle School immediately boiled over, excitedly saying: "The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are supporting us, making our children of workers, peasants, and soldiers hold our heads high," "We listen to Chairman Mao's words ten thousand times, and we will fight wherever Chairman Mao points."
    Many revolutionary students from institutions of higher learning also used their own personal experiences to put up tens of thousands of big-character posters and held rallies to expose the poison of the old bourgeois education system. They expressed that they must carry out a thorough reform of the education system in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and truly transform the universities and colleges in the capital into solid positions for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    从昨夜到今天，一批又一批的革命师生来到中共中央和国务院所在地的门前，汇集到天安门广场，他们在这里向党中央、毛主席和国务院送贺信，表决心，举行庆祝集会，发表充满无限革命豪情的热情演说。广大革命师生纷纷表示：一定要坚决听党中央和毛主席的话，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底搞掉资产阶级、修正主义的教育路线，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在无产阶级教育阵地上永远飘扬，世世代代把毛泽东思想传下去。
    许多学生昨天晚上听到广播后，都欢喜得跳了起来，拍手欢呼，奔走传告：“毛主席说出了我们心里的话”，“党中央和国务院表达了我们彻底闹革命的决心和共同心愿”。当夜，许多学校的革命师生纷纷贴出拥护改革高考办法的大字报，有的深夜从离城几十里的郊区跑步来到中共中央和国务院所在地的门前，给党中央和毛主席送庆贺信和决心书。今天，从早到晚，又有成千上万的革命师生，欢欣鼓舞地抬着我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的画象，抬着“坚决做无产阶级革命事业接班人”等巨幅标语，敲锣打鼓，一批又一批川流不息地涌向中共中央和国务院所在地门前，涌向天安门广场。
    在文化大革命已经取得重大胜利的北京大学的许多革命师生，昨天连夜给党中央和毛主席写信，并且当夜跑步送进城里。这个学校地质地理系二年级古生物专业全体同学在他们的信上写道：“敬爱的党中央、我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席：今天晚上我们从广播里听到北京女一中和北京四中同学的革命倡议，我们表示坚决的支持。高中的同学既然要拦腰斩断知识界产生修正主义的根源，那我们就要把现存的一切资产阶级教育制度彻底粉碎，换上无产阶级的教育制度。”信中说：“在大学生活的短短二年里，我们深深体会到资产阶级思想通过各种渠道在腐蚀着我们，如果不堵死这些渠道，资产阶级仍有可能复辟，我们的国家仍有可能改变颜色，只有铲除这些旧制度，才能彻底改造资产阶级知识分子，才能杜绝新的资产阶级精神贵族的产生，才能保证我们党、我们国家永不改变颜色，这是百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。”同学们怀着万分激动的心情在信中说：“敬爱的党中央，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，你们放心吧！毛泽东思想的伟大红旗决不会在我们这一代失传，我们要世世代代把它永远传下去，资产阶级复辟的阴谋决不能在我们这一代得逞，他们永远也不会得逞。在我们的心目中，最大的权威那就是您——我们的最伟大、最英明、最敬爱的领袖毛主席，那就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”
    全市许多中学的应届高、初中毕业生和广大革命师生，今天也成群结队，唱着《大海航行靠舵手》、《做无产阶级革命事业的接班人》等革命歌曲，来到中共中央和国务院所在地门前，来到天安门广场，表达他们无比欢欣鼓舞的革命热情，表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰和无限崇拜。北京女一中初三（六）班的一群学生在写给党中央和毛主席的信上说：我们是革命的后代，是无产阶级革命事业的接班人，我们应该是世界青年的革命先锋，我们应该也必须带头砸烂旧的教育制度。郊区通县一中高三（二）班的革命学生在信里说，当我们从广播中听到党中央和毛主席的英明决定，我们的心飞向了党中央和毛主席。我们向党和毛主席表示，坚决把文化大革命进行到底，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，砸烂旧的科举制度，就是上刀山，下火海，粉身碎骨，也永远跟着党和毛主席干革命，干一辈子中国革命，干一辈子世界革命。
    国务院的一位负责人，在中共中央和国务院所在地门前，热情地接待一批又一批的革命师生，并且对学生们表示，一定把同学们的热烈祝贺和决心报告给毛主席、刘主席、周总理，勉励他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。学生们听了都异常激动，同声振臂高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“彻底改革教育制度！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
    今天，天安门广场一片欢腾，许多学校的革命师生从四面八方汇集到这里举行庆祝集会。宽阔的广场上，红旗林立，人山人海，到处载歌载舞。北京四中、三中、六中、二十八中、四十一中、女八中、女六中等学校的师生，是上午最先赶到这里的。向党中央和毛主席提出革命倡议的北京四中学生，抬着一幅表达毛主席对青年无限关怀的宣传画《希望寄托在你们身上》，赶来参加庆祝会。北京女六中许多学生双手捧着披挂着红绸的毛主席象和大红喜字，庆贺这一大喜事。北京第四十一中许多班的学生都带着给党中央和毛主席的喜报来到天安门广场。这个学校的高三（三）班学生在喜报里说：我们最热烈地欢呼党中央、毛主席的英明决定。我们坚决听党的话听毛主席的话，在无产阶级文化大革命中，经风雨、见世面，在暴风雨中锻炼成长，誓做无产阶级的坚强后代，誓做共产主义事业的一代新人。为了我们祖国千秋万代永不变色，为祖国人民和世界人民无限美好的未来，我们誓将革命进行到底。二十八中一千多学生在天安门广场举行庆祝集会时，十多个学生争相演说。初三（九）班的学生代表激动地说：敬爱的领袖毛主席，我们是您一手培养起来的革命后代。革命前辈用鲜血、用生命换来的江山，我们要用鲜血、用生命保住它。为了接好革命的班，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想接过来，传下去，我们就一定要投身于革命的大风大浪中经受锻炼，粉身碎骨在所不惜。许多工农家庭出身的学生热泪盈眶，忆苦思甜，在天安门前纷纷控诉旧社会剥夺劳动人民掌握文化的权利，控诉资产阶级“权威”推行资产阶级教育路线，对工农子女实行资产阶级专政的罪行。他们热烈欢呼中共中央和毛主席的英明决定，表示一定要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗扛到底。
    今天，北京许多大中学校到处贴出了庆贺中共中央和国务院英明决定的大字报，到处在传告北京女一中、男四中学生的革命倡议，到处在座谈讨论。北京女八中高中三年级的学生们在宣读了决定和《人民日报》的社论之后，大家立刻沸腾起来，纷纷激动地说：“党中央、毛主席给我们撑了腰，使我们工农兵子女扬眉吐气”，“我们一万个听毛主席的话，毛主席指到哪里，就打到哪里”。
    许多高等学校的革命学生还用自己的亲身体会，贴出成千上万张大字报，纷纷举行集会，揭露资产阶级旧教育制度的毒害。他们纷纷表示，一定要在这场无产阶级文化大革命中对教育制度来一次彻底的大改革，把首都的高等学校真正变成培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的巩固阵地。
