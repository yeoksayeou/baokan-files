    Castor silkworm cultivation has begun on a large scale in various parts of Hubei.
    Hubei Province had not cultivated castor silkworms in the past. Last year, 26 counties including Hanyang and Huanggang introduced 1,300 boxes of castor silkworm eggs from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region for trial cultivation, which was generally successful. This year, more than 50 counties across the province have formulated plans to develop castor silkworm production. In order to provide sufficient feed for castor silkworms, many communes and teams have made full use of scattered and idle land to plant large quantities of castor plants. The province's castor planting area has more than doubled compared to last year.

    湖北各地大量饲养蓖麻蚕
    湖北各地开始大量饲养蓖麻蚕。
    湖北省过去没有饲养过蓖麻蚕。去年，汉阳、黄冈等二十六个县从广西壮族自治区引进一千三百盒蓖麻蚕种试养，普遍获得成功。今年全省有五十多个县制定了发展蓖麻蚕生产的规划。为了给蓖麻蚕提供充足的饲料，许多社、队充分利用零星土地和闲散土地种植大批蓖麻。全省蓖麻种植面积比去年扩大了一倍多。
