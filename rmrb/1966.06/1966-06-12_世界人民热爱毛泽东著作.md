    People of the World Love Mao Zedong's Works
    Mao Zedong's works are the best. I have never seen such good books in my life. Long live Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong!
       ——Jean Frederick, Canada
    The great Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" have never left my side. I believe they are theoretical weapons of extremely great significance to us Japanese people.
               ——Yoshida Matsuo, Japan
    Previously, I did not understand why the broad masses of the Chinese people praised Mao Zedong Thought every day. After I read Chairman Mao's works, such as "On New Democracy," "On Protracted War," and Chairman Mao's poems, I truly realized that Mao Zedong Thought is great and worthy of praise by the people of the world.
                 ——Gu Weixing, Malaya
    I don't know how to describe the inspirational power of Mao Zedong's works to me. I have read "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." A few years ago, I also read "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" I deeply know the profundity of the great Chairman Mao Zedong's analysis of problems.　——Agbojean, Togo
    Chairman Mao has such a famous scientific conclusion: Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. It seems that the reactionaries look terrible, but in reality, they don't have any great power. They are just paper tigers. Chairman Mao also said: Dust never disappears automatically without sweeping. Dear Chairman Mao made all the exploited and oppressed people understand that they should despise all tyrants, because they can defeat those who have oppressed them for a long time. He thoroughly dispelled illusions for the people and called on all the people to arm themselves and eradicate the oppressive system with various resolute actions instead of empty ideals or words.　——Saif, Tanzania
    I am very willing to study the thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, because he is a great man, a truly faithful person to the anti-imperialist struggle. His great thoughts have shaken the capitalist world, especially American imperialism.
            ——Marie-Josée, France

    世界人民热爱毛泽东著作
    毛泽东的著作是最好的，我一生未见过这样的好书。列宁、斯大林、毛泽东万岁！
       ——加拿大让·弗莱德里克
    伟大毛泽东的《实践论》、《矛盾论》一刻也没有离开我的身边，我相信它对我们日本人民是有极其重大意义的理论武器。
               ——日本吉田松雄
    先前，我不理解广大的中国人民为什么天天赞扬毛泽东思想，当我读了毛主席的作品，如《新民主主义论》、《论持久战》及毛主席的诗词后，才真正知道毛泽东思想是伟大的，值得世界人民赞扬的。
                 ——马来亚　顾伟兴
    我不知道如何叙述毛泽东著作给我的鼓舞力量。我已读过《毛泽东选集》。几年前，我又读了《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》，我深知伟大的毛泽东主席对问题分析的深刻性。　——多哥阿格保让
    毛主席有这样著名的科学论断：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量，只不过是一只纸老虎。毛主席还说：从来没有不经打扫而自动去掉的灰尘。亲爱的毛主席使所有受到剥削和压迫的人民懂得要蔑视一切暴君，因为他们能够战胜长期压迫他们的人。他为人民彻底驱掉了幻想，号召全体人民武装起来，以各种坚决的行动而不是空洞的理想或语言来铲除压迫制度。　——坦桑尼亚赛义夫
    我很愿意学习毛泽东同志的思想，因为他是一个伟大的人，一个真正忠实于反帝斗争的人。他的伟大思想震撼了资本主义世界，特别是美帝国主义。
            ——法国玛丽·约瑟
