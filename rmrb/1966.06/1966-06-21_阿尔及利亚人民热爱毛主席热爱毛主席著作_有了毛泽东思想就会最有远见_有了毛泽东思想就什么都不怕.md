    (Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 19th) This reporter reports: During the recent performance tour of the China Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe in 27 cities and towns in Algeria, people from all walks of life in Algeria expressed their love for Chairman Mao, his writings, and Mao Zedong Thought in various ways.
    After the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe performed in Bougie, a famous port in eastern Algeria, they went to the beach for sightseeing. An Algerian sailor asked an acrobat from the troupe, "Were you sent by Mao Zedong?" The acrobat replied, "Yes." The sailor immediately grasped the Chinese actor's hand tightly and said excitedly, "I feel strength as soon as I hear the three words 'Mao Zedong.' With Mao Zedong Thought, people have the greatest foresight."
    In Jijel, another port in eastern Algeria, two Algerian tax officials asked the Chinese actors for Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao's poems, and Chairman Mao's writings on literature and art after watching the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe's performance. One of them said, "Mao Zedong is a great statesman, military strategist, writer, and poet."
    The Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe visited and performed in Algeria for nearly two months, traveling almost all over Algeria and conducting extensive friendly contacts with people from all walks of life in Algeria. Algerian workers, peasants, soldiers, and others always expressed their love and deep feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in various ways when meeting with the Chinese acrobats.
    In Algiers, the capital, at a reception held by Zeng Tao, the Chinese Ambassador to Algeria, for the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe's visit and performance, a student from an Algerian dance school told a member of the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe's orchestra with joy that he had portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Mao Zedong hanging in his home. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is good. I am against the Soviet Union's line of peaceful coexistence. There are still many people in the world suffering, and the Vietnamese people are still fighting. How can there be any peaceful coexistence?!" Another student said to an acrobat from the troupe: China is a revolutionary country and a model for people of all countries in the world.
    An Algerian soldier said, "I realized that with Mao Zedong Thought, you fear nothing." An Algerian artist also said to a Chinese actor, "I often read the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' The principles Mao Zedong speaks of are the most thorough, and Mao Zedong Thought is great." Many people at the reception also toasted to the health of Chairman Mao!
    An Algerian car driver once invited the acrobatic troupe actors to his home as guests. He pointed to the Mao Zedong's work in his hand and told his family, "Mao Zedong is a great figure, and we should study his works well."
    In the city of Touggourt in the Sahara, two Algerian primary school teachers twice asked the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe actors for separate editions of Chairman Mao's works and other Chinese books and periodicals. They said that they not only wanted to read these books themselves, but also wanted to introduce Mao Zedong's works to their friends and students so that it could play a greater role.
    Many Algerian friends who directly or indirectly participated in Algeria's seven-and-a-half-year national liberation war always unforgettably thanked Chairman Mao for sending them spiritual and material assistance in their most difficult times when talking with the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe actors about the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people. In the western city of Sidi Bel Abbès, when the acrobatic troupe actors were dining at the military club, an officer from the Oran Military Region told them, "During the war of resistance against the French, we ate Chinese rice and drank Chinese tea. We knew Mao Zedong very early on. My home still preserves Mao Zedong's works and Mao Zedong's portrait."
    In a store in Constantine, an Algerian friend said that Mao Zedong was a great figure and a friend of Algeria. In the theater in Souk Ahras, when the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe sang the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," a spectator couldn't help but shout "Long live Mao Zedong!"
    Wherever the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe actors went, many Algerian friends asked for Chairman Mao badges. They considered this the most precious souvenir. Whether men or women, adults or children, they all longed to have a Chairman Mao badge hanging on their chests.

    阿尔及利亚人民热爱毛主席热爱毛主席著作
    有了毛泽东思想就会最有远见
    有了毛泽东思想就什么都不怕
    据新华社阿尔及尔十九日电　本社记者报道：在中国太原杂技团最近在阿尔及利亚二十七个城镇访问演出过程中，阿尔及利亚各阶层人民用各种方式表示了他们热爱毛泽东主席，热爱毛主席的著作，热爱毛泽东思想。
    太原杂技团演员们在阿尔及利亚东部著名港口布日伊演出后，到海边去游览，一位阿尔及利亚海员问杂技团一位演员说：“你是毛泽东派来的吗？”这个演员回答说：“是”。这位海员马上紧紧地握着中国演员的手，激动地说：“我一听到毛泽东这三个字就有了力量。有了毛泽东思想，人们就最有远见。”
    在阿尔及利亚东部的另一个港口吉杰利，两位阿尔及利亚的税务工作者在看完太原杂技团的演出后，找中国演员要毛主席的著作、毛主席的诗词和毛主席关于文艺问题的著作。他们之中的一位说：“毛泽东是伟大的政治家、军事家、作家和诗人。”
    太原杂技团在阿尔及利亚访问演出将近两个月，几乎走遍了整个阿尔及利亚，同阿尔及利亚各阶层人士进行了广泛的友好接触。阿尔及利亚工人、农民、士兵和其他人士在会见中国杂技团演员时，总是通过各种方式表达他们对毛主席和毛泽东思想的热爱和深厚的感情。
    在首都阿尔及尔，在中国驻阿尔及利亚大使曾涛为太原杂技团访问演出而举行的招待会上，有一位阿尔及利亚舞蹈学校的学生满怀喜悦的心情告诉太原杂技团乐队一个队员说，他家中挂有马克思、恩格斯、列宁和毛泽东的像。他说：“毛泽东思想就是好。我就是反对苏联的和平共处路线。世界上现在还有许多人在受苦受难，越南人民还在打仗。这那里能有什么和平共处呢？！”另一位学生对杂技团一个演员说：中国是一个革命的国家，是全世界各国人民的榜样。
    一位阿尔及利亚军人说：“我体会到，有了毛泽东思想就什么都不怕。”一位阿尔及利亚美术工作者也对中国演员说：“我经常读《毛泽东选集》。毛泽东讲的道理最透彻，毛泽东思想就是伟大。”许多人在招待会上还为毛泽东主席的健康干杯！
    一位阿尔及利亚汽车司机有一次邀请杂技团演员到他家里作客。他指着他手里拿着的毛泽东著作告诉他家里的人说：“毛泽东是伟大的人物，我们应该好好地学习他的著作。”
    在撒哈拉的图古尔特城，有两个阿尔及利亚小学教师两次向太原杂技团演员索取毛主席著作的单行本和其他中国书刊。他们说，他们不但自己要读这些书，而且一定要把毛泽东的著作介绍给他们的朋友和学生，让它发挥更大的作用。
    许多直接或间接地参加过阿尔及利亚七年半民族解放战争的阿尔及利亚朋友在同太原杂技团演员畅谈中阿两国人民的战斗友谊时，总是念念不忘地感谢毛泽东主席在他们最困难的时候给他们送来了精神的和物质的援助。在西部西迪贝莱贝斯市，当杂技团演员在军人俱乐部用餐时，一位奥兰军区的军官告诉他们说：“在抗法战争时，我们吃的是中国大米，喝的是中国茶，我们很早就知道毛泽东。我的家中至今还保存着毛泽东的著作和毛泽东的像。”
    在君士坦丁的一家商店里，一位阿尔及利亚朋友说，毛泽东是一位伟大的人物，是阿尔及利亚的朋友。在苏卡赫拉斯的剧场里，当太原杂技团演唱《大海航行靠舵手》的歌曲时，有个观众情不自禁地高呼“毛泽东万岁！”
    太原杂技团演员所到之处，都有许多阿尔及利亚朋友索取毛主席纪念章。他们认为这是最珍贵的纪念品。不论是男人或女人，大人或小孩，他们都渴望有一个毛主席纪念章挂在胸前。
