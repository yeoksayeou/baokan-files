    The Lu Ping gang harbored a deep-seated hatred for the Party's education policy, consistently resorting to double-dealing and deceiving superiors while undermining subordinates, opposing the Party's education policy, and vigorously promoting the bourgeois revisionist education line.

    Before 1958, children of workers and peasants generally accounted for about 90 percent of the total number of students admitted to Peking University each year. After 1961, the proportion of worker-peasant children declined year by year, reaching only 52.8 percent in 1963. The Lu Ping anti-Party gang made things difficult for the worker-peasant children who had already been admitted, subjecting them to ridicule, suppression, and attacks, slandering them as having "well-developed limbs but underdeveloped brains," and saying they were "not material for studying," and so on. However, they treated the children of non-worker-peasant families differently, saying they were from "scholarly families" and were "material for studying." In order to achieve the goal of excluding worker-peasant children, the Lu Ping gang, under the guise of guaranteeing "quality," got rid of a large number of worker-peasant children, some even being expelled from the school. For example, among the students who repeated grades in the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics in the class of 1960, worker-peasant children accounted for more than 80 percent. Only one of ten Party members was promoted to the next grade. However, students from non-worker-peasant backgrounds were given preferential treatment, strengthened tutoring, and cultivated into "top students," and after graduation, they were assigned to important national positions. When the students raised objections to the Party committee, the Lu Ping gang gave big talks at the general meeting about "attaching importance to performance," saying things like "If we expel these more than 40 percent of students with bad backgrounds from the school, we will not be able to run Peking University." Attempting to use "attaching importance to performance" to oppose the Party's class line and cultivate the bourgeois and revisionist successors they needed.

    The Party's education policy clearly points out: education must serve proletarian politics, and education must be combined with productive labor. However, the likes of Lu Ping resolutely opposed us going out of the school and combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Labor courses in the Chinese Department and the Western Languages Department were removed from the curriculum. Many factories run by students were closed down. When we raised objections to the Party committee, the Lu Ping gang hypocritically asked us to "study hard," saying things like "the school has unified arrangements," "the steps should be steady," and so on. Some departments, after struggle, only managed to win the right to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, but the time was severely restricted, generally not exceeding three to five days, and if the time limit was exceeded, they were ordered to return.

    The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao instructed us to implement the principle of "less but better," so that we can develop actively and vividly in all aspects of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. However, the Lu Ping gang resolutely opposed doing so. At a teachers and students meeting, Lu Ping said venomously that "teaching reform has not brought us any benefits, on the contrary, it has brought us great losses." Although Peking University shouted loudly for teaching reform, it only shouted and did not reform. Not only that, but they also viciously arranged the weekly courses and meetings so fully that students had very little time for physical activities. In every higher education sports competition and hygiene evaluation, our school's ranking was among the last few.

    From the above facts, it can be seen that the Lu Ping gang's words are extremely sweet, but their hearts are extremely poisonous. Their criminal activities are ironclad evidence and cannot be denied no matter how hard they try. We must take back this cultural position of Peking University from the hands of the Lu Ping gang and truly grasp it in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries.

### 北大黑帮反对党的教育方针的罪行

    北大黑帮反对党的教育方针的罪行
    陆平黑帮对党的教育方针恨之入骨，一向采取阳奉阴违，瞒上欺下的伎俩，反对党的教育方针，大力推行资产阶级修正主义的教育路线。
    一九五八年以前，北大每年招生总数中，工农子弟一般占百分之九十左右。一九六一年以后，工农子弟的比例逐年下降，到一九六三年，工农子弟只占百分之五十二点八。对已经入学的工农子弟，陆平反党黑帮百般刁难，冷嘲热讽，压抑打击，污蔑他们“四肢发达头脑笨”，“不是读书的材料”，等等。他们对非工农子弟却另眼看待，说他们是“书香门第”，是“读书的材料”。陆平黑帮为了达到排斥工农子弟的目的，在所谓保证“质量”的幌子下，把大批工农子弟搞下去，有的甚至被赶出校门。如六零级数力系的留级生中，工农子弟就占了百分之八十以上。十名党员只有一名升级。对非工农子弟出身的学生，却给他们“吃偏饭”，加强辅导，培养成“尖子”，毕业后，分配他们到国家重要岗位上去。当同学们向党委提出意见时，陆平黑帮却在大会上大讲“重在表现”，说什么“如果把这百分之四十多的出身不好的学生赶出校门，我们北大就办不成了”。妄图以“重在表现”，来反对党的阶级路线，培养他们所需要的资产阶级、修正主义的接班人。
    党的教育方针明确地指出：教育要为无产阶级政治服务，教育要与生产劳动相结合。可是，陆平之流坚决反对我们走出校门，和工农兵结合。中文系、西语系的劳动课从课程表上被删掉了。许多学生办的工厂被关门了。我们向党委提出意见时，陆平黑帮假惺惺地要我们“好好学习”，说什么“学校有统一安排”，“步子要稳”，等等。有些系经过斗争，才争到与工农兵结合的权利，但时间限制很严，一般不得超过三至五天，如果超过期限，就勒令召回。
    党中央和毛主席指示我们实行半工半读、半农半读。全国各地学校纷纷响应党中央和毛主席的这一号召，办起了许多半工（农）半读的新型学校。然而，北大却按兵不动，同学们的申请书被打入“冷宫”，杳无音讯。后来，在全国形势的压力下，陆平黑帮才被迫于一九六五年下半年在哲学系和历史系搞试点。在历史系半工半读开学典礼会上，陆平请来了宋硕、邓拓等黑帮头子，组成了牛鬼蛇神的“大合唱”，大肆攻击党的半工（农）半读方针。陆平更明目张胆地污蔑半工（农）半读是“肉包子打狗，有去无回”。
    党中央和毛主席教导我们要贯彻“少而精”的原则，使我们在德智体诸方面生动活泼地主动地得到发展。可是，陆平黑帮坚决反对这样做。在一次师生大会上，陆平恶毒地说什么“教学改革并没有给我们带来任何好处，相反给我们带来了很大的损失”。北大虽然高喊教改、教改，可是光喊不改。不仅如此，他们还狠毒地把每周的课程、会议，安排得满满的，学生很少有时间进行体育活动。在每次高等院校体育比赛和卫生评比中，我校的名次都是后几名。
    从上面的事实可以看出，陆平黑帮其言极甜，其心极毒。他们的罪恶勾当，铁证如山，想抵赖是抵赖不了的。我们一定要把北大这个文化阵地从陆平这伙黑帮手里夺回来，真正掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。
