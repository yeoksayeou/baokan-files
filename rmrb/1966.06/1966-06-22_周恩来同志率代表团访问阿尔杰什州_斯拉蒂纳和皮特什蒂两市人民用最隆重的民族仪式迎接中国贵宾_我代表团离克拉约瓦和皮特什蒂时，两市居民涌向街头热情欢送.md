    Xinhua News Agency, Pitești, June 21st—The Chinese Party and Government Delegation headed by Comrade Zhou Enlai arrived in Slatina City and Pitești, the capital of Argeș County, from Oltenia County, Romania, by car this morning to conduct a tour and visit.

    Accompanying Comrade Zhou Enlai were Ion Gheorghe Maurer, Member of the Executive Committee of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee, Member of the Standing Presidium of the Central Committee, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Emil Bodnăraș, Member of the Executive Committee of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee, Member of the Standing Presidium of the Central Committee, and First Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, among others.

    At nine o'clock in the morning, when the motorcade of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation arrived at the county border of Argeș County, the Party and government leaders of the county made a special trip to the border to greet them. When the motorcade arrived in the suburbs of Slatina City, a respected elder, on behalf of the people of the city, presented Comrade Zhou Enlai with bread and salt. A group of young men and women dressed in gorgeous Romanian national costumes toasted the Chinese guests and presented bouquets, using the most grand national rituals to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests.

    When the Chinese Party and Government Delegation drove into the urban area of Slatina, the streets of this emerging city were lined with welcoming crowds. They used flowers and warm applause to escort the distinguished Chinese guests all the way to the Slatina Aluminum Plant. The plant director, Ion Filip, and other responsible persons of the plant, as well as the plant's workers, warmly welcomed Comrade Zhou Enlai and other members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation.

    The Slatina Aluminum Plant went into production in June 1965 and is Romania's first aluminum plant. This plant, which has modern equipment, is expected to have an annual aluminum production capacity of 50,000 tons by the end of this year. Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Ion Gheorghe Maurer, and Comrade Emil Bodnăraș, as well as members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, accompanied by Director Filip, toured the plant and greeted the welcoming crowd before visiting the various workshops. During the tour, Comrade Zhou Enlai warmly shook hands with the workers and talked cordially with them. In the casting workshop, Comrade Zhou Enlai took the hand of a seventeen-year-old young worker, V. Stroica, and cordially inquired about his family situation and work, and wished him better results in his work. At the end of the tour, Comrade Zhou Enlai inscribed in the guestbook: "The friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people will last forever." Comrades Zhao Yimin, Qiao Guanhua, and Zeng Yongquan also signed their names on it. Director Ion Filip, on behalf of the plant, presented a sample of the first furnace of pure aluminum from the plant to the Chinese guests as a souvenir, and Comrade Zhou Enlai also presented gifts to the plant.

    After concluding the visit to the Slatina Aluminum Plant, the Chinese Party and Government Delegation immediately drove to Pitești. On the approximately 70-kilometer journey, every time the motorcade of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation passed through a town or village, large crowds waved Chinese and Romanian national flags, cheering and saluting the distinguished Chinese guests with sincere feelings. When the members of the agricultural cooperative working in the fields saw the motorcade arrive, they put down their farm tools and rushed to the side of the road to wave to the Chinese guests. In the town of Siliștea Dealului, more than 2,000 people lined the streets to welcome them. According to Romanian national custom, many households along the road placed tables at their doors, covered with exquisite tapestries, placed potted flowers, and some even put up Chinese national flags to express the most solemn welcome to the distinguished Chinese guests.

    When the Chinese Party and Government Delegation arrived at the Pitești Timber Industry Processing United Factory, the workers standing in front of the factory to welcome them enthusiastically cheered the Chinese guests. General Director V. Celu introduced the situation of the United Factory to the Chinese guests. He said that the United Factory began construction in 1961, and now eight branch factories have been put into production. At present, the United Factory can process 300,000 cubic meters of logs annually, produce 15,000 sets of furniture, and 250,000 square meters of flooring, etc. Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Ion Gheorghe Maurer, Comrade Emil Bodnăraș listened with great interest to the introduction by the General Director, and under the guidance of the General Director, visited the various branch factories. Comrade Zhou Enlai inquired about the production situation of the factory and viewed the products of the various branch factories. Finally, Head Zhou Enlai and members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation inscribed souvenirs in the guestbook. The hosts and guests also exchanged gifts.

    When the Chinese Party and Government Delegation left the United Factory, a young female Young Pioneer ran out of the cheering crowd, rushed to the delegation's car, and gave a bouquet of flowers and a red scarf just taken off her neck to the Chinese comrades in the car. At this time, there was even more enthusiastic applause from the crowd.

    After the tour, the Argeș County Committee of the Romanian Communist Party and the Executive Committee of the County People's Council hosted a luncheon in Pitești to entertain Comrade Zhou Enlai.

    Comrade Ion Gheorghe Maurer and Comrade Emil Bodnăraș, as well as the Party and government leaders of the county, attended the banquet. Members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation Zhao Yimin, Qiao Guanhua, and Zeng Yongquan also attended the banquet.

He said that the working people of Argeș County, together with the people of Romania, are pleased with the achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people in socialist construction and pay tribute to the heroic Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude and deep respect to the people of Pitești and the entire Argeș County on behalf of the Chinese people.

    周恩来同志率代表团访问阿尔杰什州
    斯拉蒂纳和皮特什蒂两市人民用最隆重的民族仪式迎接中国贵宾
    我代表团离克拉约瓦和皮特什蒂时，两市居民涌向街头热情欢送
    新华社皮特什蒂二十一日电　以周恩来同志为首的中国党政代表团二十一日上午乘汽车从罗马尼亚奥尔登尼亚州到达阿尔杰什州的斯拉蒂纳市和这个州的首府皮特什蒂进行参观访问。
    陪同周恩来同志访问的有罗共中央执委、中央常设主席团委员、部长会议主席扬·格·毛雷尔和罗共中央执委、中央常设主席团委员、部长会议第一副主席埃·波德纳拉希等。
    上午九时，当中国党政代表团的车队到达阿尔杰什州的州界时，这个州的党政领导人专程赶到州界迎接。车队到达斯拉蒂纳市郊，一位德高望重的老人代表这个城市的人民向周恩来同志献了面包和盐，穿着华丽的罗马尼亚民族服装的一群男女青年，向中国客人敬了酒并献了花束，以最隆重的民族仪式来迎接中国贵宾。
    中国党政代表团驱车进入斯拉蒂纳市区时，这个新兴城市的街道上，排满了欢迎的人群。他们用鲜花和热烈的掌声一直把中国贵宾送到斯拉蒂纳炼铝厂。这个工厂厂长扬·菲利普和工厂的其他负责人，以及工厂的职工们热情地欢迎周恩来同志和中国党政代表团的其他成员。
    斯拉蒂纳炼铝厂于一九六五年六月投入生产，是罗马尼亚的第一座炼铝厂。这个有着现代化设备的工厂，预计到今年年底，铝的年产量可达到五万吨。周恩来同志、扬·格·毛雷尔同志和埃·波德纳拉希同志以及中国党政代表团的成员，在菲利普厂长的陪同下，绕厂一周，向欢迎的人群致意后，参观了各个车间。周恩来同志在参观过程中，同工人们热烈握手并亲切谈话。在铸造车间，周恩来同志拉着十七岁的年轻工人维·斯特罗伊卡的手，亲切地询问他的家庭状况和工作情况，并祝他在工作上取得更好成绩。参观结束时，周恩来同志在贵宾留言簿上题词：“中罗两国人民友谊万古长青。”赵毅敏、乔冠华、曾涌泉等同志也在上面签了名。扬·菲利普厂长代表工厂把这个工厂第一炉纯铝的样品给中国客人留念，周恩来同志也向工厂赠送了礼物。
    中国党政代表团结束了斯拉蒂纳炼铝厂的访问后，立即驱车赴皮特什蒂。在约七十公里的路程中，中国党政代表团的车队每经过一个市镇或乡村，都有大批群众挥动中罗两国国旗，以真挚的感情向中国贵宾欢呼致意。在田间劳动的农业合作社社员们，看到车队到达时，便放下手中农具，赶到公路旁边来向中国客人招手致意。在离皮特什蒂二十多公里的西利斯德斯德尼镇，两千多人夹道欢迎，按照罗马尼亚的民族习惯，沿公路两旁的许多住户都把桌子摆到门口，桌子上面铺着精美的壁毯，放着盆花，有的还插上中国国旗，以表示对中国贵宾的最隆重欢迎。
    当中国党政代表团抵达皮特什蒂木材工业处理联合工厂时，站在工厂门前欢迎的职工们热情地向中国客人欢呼。总厂长维·切卢向中国客人介绍了这个联合工厂的情况。他说，联合工厂于一九六一年开始建设，现在已有八个分厂投入生产。目前，联合工厂每年能加工三十万立方米原木，年产一万五千套家具，二十五万平方米地板等。周恩来同志和扬·格·毛雷尔同志、埃·波德纳拉希同志兴致勃勃地听完总厂长的介绍后，在总厂长的引导下，参观了各个分厂。周恩来同志询问了工厂的生产情况，并观看了各个分厂的产品。最后，周恩来团长和中国党政代表团团员们在贵宾留言簿上题词留念。宾主双方还互赠了礼品。
    当中国党政代表团离开联合工厂时，一个女少先队员从欢送的人群中跑出来，奔向代表团的汽车，把一束鲜花和刚从她的脖子上解下来的一条红领巾送给汽车里的中国同志。这时，人群中爆发出更加热烈的掌声。
    参观以后，罗共阿尔杰什州委员会和州人民会议执行委员会在皮特什蒂设午宴招待周恩来同志。
    扬·格·毛雷尔同志和埃·波德纳拉希同志以及这个州的党政负责人出席了宴会。中国党政代表团团员赵毅敏、乔冠华和曾涌泉也出席了宴会。
    罗共阿尔杰什州委第一书记彼得·杜米尼加同志在宴会上致词，代表州委会、州人民会议执委会和这个州的全体劳动人民，热烈欢迎由周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团到这个州来访问。他说，阿尔杰什州的劳动人民同罗马尼亚全国人民一起，为兄弟的中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的成就感到高兴，并向英雄的中国人民和中国共产党致敬。
    周恩来同志在致祝酒词时说：“在参观访问过程中，我们受到了你们热烈的欢迎和隆重的接待。你们人民用各种各样的方式，表达对中国人民的友好感情。我愿意利用这个机会，代表中国人民，向皮特什蒂市和阿尔杰什州全体人民，致以衷心的感谢和深切的敬意。我们祝你们州的人民和全体罗马尼亚人民在今后的社会主义建设中取得新的更大的成就。”
    宴会是在热烈友好的气氛中进行的，宾主不断为中罗两国人民的兄弟友谊和合作而干杯。
    彼得·杜米尼加同志向周恩来同志和中国党政代表团全体团员赠送礼物留念，周恩来同志也向主人赠送了礼物。
    宴会后，中国党政代表团乘车返回布加勒斯特。当周恩来同志到达和离开皮特什蒂市时，全市的男女老少都拥挤在街道两旁和广场上热烈欢呼，向中国人民的使者致敬。

    当周恩来同志在罗马尼亚党政领导人扬·格·毛雷尔和埃·波德纳拉希等同志陪同下，离开这个州的首府克拉约瓦时，这个城市的居民倾城出动，涌到街头，热烈欢送中国贵宾。
