    (Xinhua News Agency, Dakar) Patriotic armed forces in "Portuguese" Guinea continue to strike in the northern region of "Portuguese" Guinea. From May 28 to June 5, they killed or wounded 90 Portuguese colonial soldiers.
    A communique issued here on the 10th by the African Independence Party of Guinea and Cape Verde stated that from June 3 to 5, patriotic fighters in "Portuguese" Guinea launched multiple attacks on enemy forces in Ngole and Coutia between Mansaba and Manzoe, and in Guayamaia in the Bijambi region, killing approximately 20 enemy soldiers and wounding over 30. Patriotic fighters also attacked the enemy stronghold in Bedanda in the south, killing or wounding 40 Portuguese colonial soldiers. From May 28 to June 3, armed patriots successively attacked enemy strongholds in Olossato, Mansaba, and Manzoe, destroying many enemy facilities and causing significant losses to the enemy.
  (Xinhua News Agency, Dakar) According to a recent communique issued here by the African Independence Party of Guinea and Cape Verde, in battles in the southern and northern regions of "Portuguese" Guinea in April, patriotic armed forces killed a total of 139 Portuguese colonial soldiers and mercenaries, and wounded over 200.
    The communique stated that patriotic armed forces also destroyed 22 enemy military vehicles and seized 107 weapons.
    The communique pointed out, "April 1966 was one of the months in which the colonial army suffered the most severe losses in personnel and materiel."
    (Xinhua News Agency, Algiers) Almeida, the permanent representative of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola in Algeria, said at a press conference here on the 10th that "In order to cut off the important transportation lines of the Portuguese colonial army, the armed forces of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola recently completely destroyed a large bridge connecting the (southern) Luso military highway with the central region."
    Almeida also told the press that the city of Luso is 300 kilometers from the Angola-Zambia border. Near the city of Luso, commandos of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ambushed a Portuguese military convoy, killing 17 enemy soldiers.
    Prior to this, Almeida had already announced to reporters that the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola had opened a new front in southern Angola, a region where old and new colonialism, led by the United States, has significant interests.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam) A communique recently issued here by the Mozambique Liberation Front stated that from April 1 to 27, Mozambican freedom fighters eliminated more than 50 Portuguese colonial soldiers in the Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces of Mozambique, and destroyed four Portuguese military vehicles.
