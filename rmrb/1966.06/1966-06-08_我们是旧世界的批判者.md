    The rapid development of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has caused a worldwide sensation.
    Some say, "All seven hundred million Chinese people are critics."
    Regardless of who said this, and whether they are happy or unhappy about it, this statement reflects a fact: the vast masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in our country, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a critique of the old world, old things, and old ideas on an unprecedentedly broad scale.
    We criticize the system of exploitation, the exploiting classes, imperialism, modern revisionism, all reactionaries, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.
    We criticize bourgeois representatives and bourgeois "academic authorities."
    We criticize the bourgeois view of history, various bourgeois academic theories, bourgeois pedagogy, journalism, bourgeois literary and artistic thought, and all bad plays, bad movies, and bad works.
    In short, we criticize the old world, the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits used by imperialism and all exploiting classes to poison the working people, all non-proletarian ideas, and all reactionary ideas that oppose Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    Why do we carry out all these criticisms?
    Because it is absolutely necessary for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, for building socialism and communism, and it is in accordance with the laws of historical development. Lenin once believed that after the bourgeoisie is overthrown, its strength will exceed that of the proletariat for a long time, especially in the ideological field, where it will still be dominant and very stubborn for a long time. They will do everything possible to use this to prepare spiritually and in terms of public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. The long and fierce struggle between the two classes and the two roads on the ideological and cultural front in our country over the past seventeen years since liberation, especially the recent struggle between the bourgeois conspiracy for restoration and the proletarian anti-restoration, fully illustrates this problem.
    Chairman Mao said long ago that anything reactionary will not fall unless you strike it down. This is the same as sweeping the floor; dust will not disappear on its own unless the broom reaches it. That is how things are in the world. If we want to build a new world, we must destroy the old world; if we want to build new socialist and communist ideas and culture, we must thoroughly criticize and eliminate the old bourgeois ideas, old culture and their influence.
    The essence of Marxism-Leninism is critical and revolutionary. Its basic point is to criticize, to struggle, and to make revolution. What we practice is militant dialectical materialism. Struggle is life. The further we advance on the correct path of struggle, the more combat-effective we will be, and the more we will be able to advance our great cause.
    Chairman Mao often emphasized: "There is no construction without destruction, no flow without blockage, and no progress without stopping." The "destruction" mentioned here is criticism, is revolution. To destroy, one must reason; to reason is to construct; when destruction is put first, construction is included. Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, were established and developed in the struggle of constantly destroying the bourgeois ideological system. Chairman Mao said: "Correct things always develop in the process of struggling against wrong things. True, good, and beautiful things always exist in comparison with false, evil, and ugly things, and develop through struggle."
    Who do we rely on to criticize? Rely on the broadest masses of the people, rely on workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. The people used weapons to criticize the old world in the revolutionary war and seize political power; after victory, they used the weapon of criticism to criticize all the bad things left over by imperialism, landlords, and the bourgeoisie. Only when seven hundred million people take up Mao Zedong Thought, the sharpest weapon, to criticize, can we sweep away the dust hidden in every corner by the bourgeoisie to the greatest extent, and can we eradicate the ideology of the exploiting classes, which has been monopolizing and dominating for thousands of years, to the greatest depth. Only when the broadest masses of the people grasp the proletarian world view, criticize the bourgeois world view, grasp Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and criticize revisionist thought, can we ensure that our country carries the socialist revolution through to the end, and can we ensure that our country gradually transitions from socialism to communism.
    "Seven hundred million people are critics," this is a great and epoch-making thing. This in itself shows that seven hundred million people have liberated their minds, have completely stood up, and are no longer slaves of the old culture and old ideas of imperialism and the exploiting classes. That seven hundred million people are critics is not accidental. This is a new thing that has emerged under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a new thing that has emerged under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a new atmosphere that must inevitably arise after Mao Zedong Thought is combined with the vast masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the great awakening of the people of our country.
    The emergence and in-depth development of any great revolutionary movement must be preceded by a great struggle in the ideological field, and must be led by a great ideological revolution. In the history of the proletarian revolution, every great debate is a prelude and signal to a revolutionary leap forward. The many great ideological debates that our country has experienced in the seventeen years since liberation have each time opened up the road for the locomotive of revolution to move forward. The current unprecedentedly large-scale Cultural Revolution will inevitably herald the leaping development of our country's socialist revolution and a new great leap forward in socialist construction.
    When the people rise up, the enemy will fall. When the vast masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in our country rise up, the bourgeois representatives and bourgeois "academic authorities" will fall. In the unprecedentedly broad critical movement of the Cultural Revolution, a great new era in which seven hundred million people are all sages and heroes is appearing on the horizon.
    Let us raise our hands and welcome this great new era.

### 我们是旧世界的批判者

    我们是旧世界的批判者
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的迅猛发展，引起了世界的震动。
    有人说，“中国七亿人都是批评家。”
    不管说这句话的是什么人，不管他们对这件事是高兴还是不高兴，这句话是反映了一个事实：我国广大的工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，以毛泽东思想为武器，在空前未有的广阔规模上发动了对旧世界、旧事物、旧思想的批判。
    我们批判剥削制度，批判剥削阶级，批判帝国主义，批判现代修正主义，批判一切反动派，批判地、富、反、坏、右。
    我们批判资产阶级代表人物，批判资产阶级“学者权威”。
    我们批判资产阶级的历史观，批判资产阶级的各种学术理论，批判资产阶级的教育学、新闻学，批判资产阶级的文艺思想，批判一切坏戏、坏电影、坏作品。
    总之，我们批判旧世界，批判帝国主义和一切剥削阶级用来毒害劳动人民的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，批判一切非无产阶级思想，批判一切同马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想相对抗的反动思想。
    我们为什么要进行这一切的批判呢？
    因为这是巩固无产阶级专政所绝对必需的，是建设社会主义和共产主义所绝对必需的，是合乎历史发展规律的。列宁曾经认为，资产阶级被打倒之后，它的力量长期超过无产阶级，特别是在意识形态领域方面，它在长时间里，还占有优势，还很顽强。他们千方百计地利用这一点为资本主义复辟做精神上和舆论上的准备。我国解放十七年来，在思想文化战线上两个阶级、两条道路长期激烈的斗争，特别是最近一个时期突出出来的资产阶级阴谋复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争，充分说明了这个问题。
    毛主席早就说过，凡是反动的东西，你不打，它就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。世界上的事情都是这样。我们要建设新世界，就必须破坏旧世界，我们要建设社会主义和共产主义的新思想、新文化，就必须彻底批判和肃清资产阶级的旧思想、旧文化及其影响。
    马克思列宁主义的本质是批判的、革命的。它的基本点是要批判，要斗争，要革命。我们实行的就是战斗的辩证唯物论哲学。斗争就是生活。我们在正确的斗争轨道上前进，就越有战斗力，就越能推进我们的伟大事业。
    毛主席经常强调：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。”这里讲的破，就是批判，就是革命。破就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，就是在不断地破资产阶级思想体系的斗争中建立和发展起来的。毛主席说：“正确的东西总是在同错误的东西作斗争的过程中发展起来的。真的、善的、美的东西总是在同假的、恶的、丑的东西相比较而存在，相斗争而发展的。”
    依靠谁来批判呢？依靠最广大的人民群众，依靠工农兵、革命干部和革命的知识分子。人民群众在革命战争中用武器批判了旧世界，夺取了政权；胜利以后，又用批判的武器，批判帝国主义和地主、资产阶级遗留下来的一切坏东西。只有七亿人民都拿起毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器进行批判，才能在最大的广度上把资产阶级留藏在每个角落的灰尘打扫干净，才能在最大的深度上把几千年来居于垄断和统治地位的剥削阶级意识形态连根拔除。只有最广大的人民群众掌握无产阶级世界观，批判资产阶级世界观，掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，批判修正主义思想，才能够保证我国把社会主义革命进行到底，才能够保证我国由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义。
      “七亿人都是批评家”，这是一件了不起的大事情，是一件划时代的大事情。这本身就说明，七亿人思想解放了，完全站起来了，不再是帝国主义和剥削阶级的旧文化、旧思想的奴隶了。七亿人都做批评家，不是偶然的。这是在无产阶级专政的条件下出现的新事物。这是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下出现的新事物。这是毛泽东思想同广大工农兵相结合以后必然要产生的新气象。这是我国人民群众的伟大觉醒。
    任何一次伟大革命运动的产生和深入发展，都必然有一个意识形态领域内的大斗争作它的先行，必然有一个伟大的思想革命作它的前导。在无产阶级革命的历史上，每一次大论战，都是一次革命跃进的序幕和信号。我国解放十七年来所经历的多次思想大论战，每一次都为革命的火车头开辟了前进的道路。当前这场空前规模的文化大革命，必然预示着我国社会主义革命的飞跃发展和社会主义建设的新的大跃进。
    人民起来了，敌人就会倒下了。我国广大的工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子都起来了，资产阶级代表人物、资产阶级“学者权威”就会倒下了。在文化大革命空前广大的批判运动中，一个七亿人民尽舜尧的伟大新时代出现在地平线上了。
    让我们举起双手，欢迎这个伟大的新时代。
