    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 17th – The World Peace Council meeting closed here on the evening of the 16th. The manipulators of the meeting, without allowing the plenary session to conduct discussions, started the voting machine and forcibly passed a series of meeting documents. The Chinese delegation, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried out a tit-for-tat struggle with the Soviet representatives and their followers, thoroughly exposing their ugly face of surrendering to imperialism.
    Before the voting on the meeting documents, Li Chuwen, head of the Chinese delegation, read the general statement of the Chinese delegation on voting on the conference documents, pointing out that this was a meeting where the Soviet leaders, in coordination with US imperialism, betrayed the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people and opposed China. Li Chuwen pointed out that at this meeting, the Soviet representatives used the method of false democracy and real control to peddle and implement the general line of "Soviet-US cooperation" in foreign policy on a series of major international issues. This is another powerful proof that the Soviet leadership group is using the World Peace Council as a diplomatic tool of a foreign country, thereby serving US imperialism. Within the short few minutes that the head of the Chinese delegation read the statement, the executive chairman of the meeting repeatedly tried to interrupt and prevent him from continuing to read. Some people on the rostrum kept waving their hands and shouting, and at the same time, there was booing and table-knocking noise in the venue. The Soviet revisionists, playing with false democracy, once again staged a disgraceful farce, further exposing their barbaric and despicable face of using any means to impose their opinions on others.
    Ignoring all the disruption, Li Chuwen insisted on finishing the statement. He then sternly condemned, saying, this is the democracy under the baton of the Soviet Union! Soviet revisionists, listen: you, like US imperialism, have torn off the last piece of fig leaf. What you are practicing is not democracy, but fascism!
    When voting on the meeting documents, the Chinese and Albanian delegations voted against the general document of the meeting, as well as documents on European security issues, the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting issues, institutional issues, etc., and did not participate in the voting on the Vietnam issue, the Cuba issue, and some other documents.
    The delegations of South Vietnam, Japan, and North Korea also made statements explaining their reasons for voting on the relevant documents. When the South Vietnamese representative explained their reason for abstaining from the general resolution on national independence, they said that the South Vietnam Peace Committee has always firmly supported the fighters of Asian, African, and Latin American countries in their struggle for national independence and liberation. The South Vietnamese delegation believes that the meeting's resolution on this issue does not correctly reflect the situation and does not clearly condemn US imperialism. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also abstained from the general resolution on national independence.
    Japanese representative Masaharu Hatanaka explained their reason for abstaining from the European security memorandum, saying that according to the documents distributed at the meeting, the Japanese delegation found that their very important amendments to the European security memorandum were not accepted, so they abstained.
    The Korean representative, in explaining their reason for voting against the meeting's letter to the United Nations Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee, pointed out that we have already opposed writing this letter at the Presidium meeting, and our opinions have not been considered at all. We believe that this letter will cause misunderstanding among peace-loving people in the world, because US imperialism is not prepared to accept disarmament, but is stepping up arms expansion and war preparation. While talking about "peace" and "disarmament," US imperialism is intensifying its war of aggression in South Vietnam, and is also carrying out provocations in Cuba and many other parts of the world. The Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee was established by the United Nations, and the United Nations is a tool for the United States to invade other countries. The United States is also an aggressor against the Korean people, and even at this moment is still occupying South Korea under the protection of the United Nations. We cannot agree to write this letter in front of the Korean people and the people of the world.
    At the closing meeting, it was announced that the newly "elected" Presidium of the World Peace Council had held a meeting on the evening of the 16th and appointed the Indian Chandra as Secretary-General. Li Chuwen, head of the Chinese delegation, stated that the Chinese delegation opposed Chandra's appointment as Secretary-General.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗揭穿苏联代表投降面目
    我代表团谴责世界和理会会议强行通过一堆坏文件
    中阿代表团投票反对总文件等，并且没有参加其它一些文件的投票
    新华社日内瓦十七日电　世界和平理事会会议十六日晚上在这里闭幕。会议操纵者不准全体会议进行讨论，就开动表决机器，强行通过一系列会议文件。中国代表团高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同苏联代表及其追随者进行了针锋相对的斗争，彻底揭穿了他们投降帝国主义的丑恶面目。
    在表决会议文件以前，中国代表团团长李储文宣读了中国代表团关于大会文件投票的总声明，指出这是一次苏联领导配合美帝国主义，出卖越南人民根本利益，反对中国的会议。李储文指出，在这次会议上，苏联代表用假民主、真控制的办法，在一系列重大国际问题上，兜售并贯彻“苏美合作”的对外政策总路线，这是苏联领导集团把世界和平理事会作为一国外交工具，从而替美帝国主义服务的又一有力证明。在中国代表团团长宣读声明的短短几分钟内，会议执行主席一再试图打断和阻止他读下去，主席台上还有人不断挥舞手势，乱喊乱叫，会场内同时发出嘘叫和敲桌子的骚乱声。玩弄假民主的苏联修正主义者就这样又一次导演了一场可耻的丑剧，进一步暴露出他们为了把自己的意见强加于人而不择手段的蛮横、卑劣面目。
    李储文不顾一切捣乱，坚持把声明读完。他接着严厉谴责说，这就是在苏联指挥棒下的民主！苏联修正主义者听着：你们同美帝国主义一样，把最后的一块遮羞布都撕光了。你们实行的不是民主，是法西斯！
    在表决会议文件时，中国和阿尔巴尼亚代表团投票反对会议总文件以及关于欧洲安全问题、十八国裁军委员会会议问题、机构问题等文件，并且没有参加关于越南问题、古巴问题以及其他一些文件的投票。
    越南南方、日本和朝鲜等代表团也分别就有关文件的投票声明理由。越南南方代表阐述他们对民族独立总决议弃权的理由时说，越南南方和平委员会一贯坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国为争取民族独立和解放而斗争的战士。越南南方代表团认为，会议关于这个问题的决议没有正确反映局势，没有明确谴责美帝国主义。越南民主共和国代表团对民族独立总决议也弃权。
    日本代表畑中政春解释他们对欧洲安全备忘录弃权的理由说，根据会上散发的文件，日本代表团发现他们对欧洲安全备忘录提出的很重要的修改意见未被接受，所以弃权。
    朝鲜代表阐述他们对会议给联合国十八国裁军委员会的信投反对票的理由时指出，我们已经在主席团会上反对写这封信，我们的意见根本未被考虑。我们认为，这封信会使世界爱好和平的人士发生误解，因为美帝国主义并不准备接受裁军，而是在加紧扩军备战。美帝国主义在谈论“和平”、“裁军”的同时，正在加紧在南越的侵略战争，还在古巴和世界其他许多地方进行挑衅。十八国裁军委员会是联合国成立的，联合国是美国侵略别国的工具。美国对朝鲜人民也是侵略者，甚至就在此刻还在联合国保护下占领着南朝鲜。在朝鲜人民和世界人民面前我们不能同意写这封信。
    在闭幕会议上，宣布新“当选”的世界和平理事会主席团已在十六日晚上开会，任命印度人钱德拉为总书记。中国代表团团长李储文声明中国代表团反对钱德拉任总书记。
