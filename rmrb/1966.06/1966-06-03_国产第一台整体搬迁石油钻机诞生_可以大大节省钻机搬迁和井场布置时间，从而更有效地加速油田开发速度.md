    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 2nd – China's first oil drilling rig capable of integrated relocation has been born in the Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Plant.
    This drilling rig has a nominal lifting weight of 75 tons and can drill to depths of 1,800 to 2,200 meters. It was designed by Chinese workers and engineers under the guidance of the Party's policy of self-reliance and striving for progress, and manufactured entirely using domestic materials. After industrial trials, it has been proven to have the characteristics of strong mobility, flexible and convenient operation, reliable braking, high degree of mechanization, fast lifting speed, light weight, and simple maintenance. Its comprehensive technical indicators have reached the advanced level of similar products, and it is particularly suitable for use in China's vast plains oil-producing areas.
    A drilling rig generally weighs one to two hundred tons, and the derrick is dozens of meters high. In the past, after drilling a well, the drilling rig had to be divided into units according to machine groups, disassembled into small pieces, transported to the new site by truck, and then reassembled and the derrick erected. In this way, the relocation time was often longer than the time it took to drill a well.
    The newly manufactured drilling rig itself is equipped with four crawler-type trailers. Under normal circumstances, only two tractors are needed to tow the drilling rig as a whole from one site to another. This greatly saves the time for drilling rig relocation and well site arrangement, thus more effectively accelerating the development speed of oilfields.

    国产第一台整体搬迁石油钻机诞生
    可以大大节省钻机搬迁和井场布置时间，从而更有效地加速油田开发速度
    新华社兰州二日电　国产第一台能够整体搬迁的石油钻机已在兰州石油化工机器厂诞生。
    这台钻机的公称起重量是七十五吨，能钻深一千八百米到两千二百米。它是我国工人和工程技术人员在党的自力更生、奋发图强的方针指引下，自行设计、并且完全使用国产材料制造成的。经过工业性试验证明，它具有移运性强、操纵灵活方便、制动可靠、机械化程度高、提开速度快、重量轻、维护保养简单等特点，它的综合技术指标已经达到同类产品的先进水平，特别适合我国广大平原石油矿区使用。
    一台钻机一般重一两百吨，井架高达数十米。过去，每钻完一口井之后，要把钻机按机组分成单元，拆成小块，用汽车搬迁到新工地，然后再重新组装和立起井架。这样，往往搬迁时间比钻一口井的时间还要长。
    新制成的钻机本身配有四台履带式拖车，在一般情况下，只要两台拖拉机牵引就可以把钻机从一个工地整体搬迁到另一个工地。这就大大地节省了钻机搬迁和井场布置的时间，从而可以更有效地加速油田的开发速度。
