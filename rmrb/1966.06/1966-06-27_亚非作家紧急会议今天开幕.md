The preparatory work for the emergency conference of Asian and African writers has been completed today. During the preparation process for the emergency conference, a significant victory was achieved by resolutely smashing the disruptive and divisive activities planned by Soviet revisionist writers, creating a very favorable situation for the Asian and African writers' movement. An unprecedented gathering of Asian and African writers will be held as scheduled tomorrow.

The heads of delegations from various countries (regions) attending the emergency conference of Asian and African writers held a meeting this afternoon. Through democratic consultation, they unanimously adopted the rules of procedure and agenda for the emergency conference of Asian and African writers, and elected Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation, as the chairman of the emergency conference of Asian and African writers, and elected the representative of the permanent bureau secretary, Manuwila, as the secretary-general of the emergency conference.

During the preparation for the emergency conference, the permanent bureau, in response to the divisive activities planned by Soviet revisionist writers in Cairo, gave a resolute counterattack. At the meeting of the permanent bureau held on June 23, a statement was unanimously adopted. The statement emphasized: "Soviet writers engaged in divisive activities, due to their deliberate sabotage of the Asian and African writers' movement, have fundamentally severed themselves from the ranks of Asian and African writers and have forever lost all rights and positions in the permanent bureau of Asian and African writers."

The facts show that the conspiracy of Soviet revisionist writers to sabotage the emergency conference of Asian and African writers has completely failed. Now, representatives of Asian and African writers have gathered in Beijing, and Soviet revisionists have been more isolated than ever. By tonight, writers' representatives from 47 countries and regions have arrived in Beijing. This is an unprecedented conference in the history of the Asian and African writers' movement.

At the meeting of the heads of delegations held this afternoon, the representative of the permanent bureau secretary, Manuwila, who presided over the meeting, reported on the arrival of representatives from various countries and regions and observers from international organizations in the Asian and African regions.

The meeting discussed and adopted the rules of procedure for the emergency conference of Asian and African writers. The rules of procedure stipulate that discussions at the conference should fully uphold democracy and make decisions in accordance with the principle of democratic consultation; if there are differing opinions, efforts should be made to reach a consensus through consultation, and if a consensus cannot be reached, the differing opinions can be reserved and recorded.

The rules of procedure stipulate that the conference will be chaired by the heads of delegations from various countries (regions). The conference will have one chairman, elected by the meeting of the heads of delegations; the chairman of the conference is also the chairman of the presidium. The conference will have one secretary-general, elected by the meeting of the heads of delegations. The conference will be chaired by the members of the presidium in turn.

The rules of procedure stipulate that the conference will establish the following four groups to conduct discussions: (1) Drafting group for the conference communiqué; (2) Group on supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese and Asian and African peoples against imperialism; (3) Group on literature serving the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle; (4) Group on strengthening the Asian and African writers' movement.

The meeting discussed and adopted the agenda for the emergency conference of Asian and African writers: (1) Supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people against the aggression of American imperialism, to liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the country; (2) The tasks of writers in the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism led by the United States to achieve and maintain national independence; (3) Opposing cultural aggression by imperialism and old and new colonialism, and developing the national culture of the peoples of various Asian and African countries.

The preparatory work for the emergency conference of Asian and African writers has been completed. Representatives from various countries are eagerly awaiting the opening of the conference tomorrow.
