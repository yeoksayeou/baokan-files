    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, June 12th – Leading cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops are going deep into companies to study Chairman Mao's works with the vast number of soldiers, participating in the Socialist Cultural Revolution, and promoting the revolutionary torrent to surge forward.
    The Fujian Front Troops Party Committee regards actively leading commanders and fighters to participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution as the top priority in highlighting politics, implementing the "Four Goods," and strengthening combat readiness. Many leading cadres personally lead working groups deep into companies. They first focus on organizing soldiers to study Chairman Mao's works, especially repeatedly reading Chairman Mao's writings on the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle, and literature and art. At the same time, they hold discussions with soldiers, write articles, and vehemently denounce the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line, using Mao Zedong Thought better in the struggle.
    A working group composed of cadres from the Propaganda Department and the Cultural Department of a certain unit of the Front Troops traveled over mountains and rivers to a remote radar station to tell the soldiers about the current situation of the Socialist Cultural Revolution and analyzed this class struggle with the soldiers using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. At the artillery positions facing the Taiwan Strait, responsible cadres of a certain artillery regiment discussed with the soldiers the questions of "How does the black gang without guns attack the Party and Socialism?" "Can literary rebels not achieve anything?" "Do soldiers with guns need to master pens?" "Who are the true masters of culture?" This enabled the soldiers to have a deeper understanding of the new situation and new characteristics of the current class struggle and the great significance of the Socialist Cultural Revolution, and their eyes became brighter. The soldiers said that although this gang of black elements does not hold knives or guns, they are more insidious and vicious than enemies holding guns and knives. They sneak into our bellies, wave "red flags" to oppose the red flag, and wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, corroding our souls with the reactionary ideas of capitalism and revisionism, and attempting to restore capitalism in China. We, the people's soldiers, must not only hold our guns tightly, ready to annihilate any enemy who dares to invade, but also be vigilant against enemies who do not hold guns and crush their great conspiracy to restore capitalism in China. After many leading cadres went deep into the companies, they also compared the black talk and black writings of the black gang elements one by one with the reactionary propaganda of the enemy Chiang Kai-shek gang in front of them and used Chairman Mao's teachings as weapons to analyze and criticize them. At the study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works, the soldiers pointed out that the black gang and the Chiang gang sing the same tune. The Chiang gang shoots openly at us from the front, and the black gang shoots arrows in the dark from behind. The master and the servant breathe through the same nostril. They are all representatives of the landlord and bourgeois classes, all妄想to overthrow socialism and once again ride on the backs of the people to act mighty and make blessings. The commanders and fighters deeply realized that studying Chairman Mao's works in the waves of class struggle is the most thorough, the most flexible, the deepest, and the most rewarding, thus pushing the upsurge of studying Chairman Mao's works in the troops to a new peak.
    Many leading cadres of the Fujian Front Troops went deep into the companies, promoting the torrent of the Socialist Cultural Revolution in the troops to move forward. Now, every sentry post, trench, and island on the southeastern coastal defense line of the motherland, every warship, and every airport is not only a position for fighting against the enemy with guns but also a battlefield for the Cultural Revolution. Every poem, every song, and every sound from here is a shell and bomb to destroy the reactionary fortresses of the black line and the black gang. At the criticism meetings held in many forward positions, cadres and soldiers shouted together, "Fire on the anti-Party, anti-socialist black gang! Fire on the monsters and demons!" Cadres and soldiers picked up their pens together, wrote articles, angrily denounced the crimes of the black line and the black gang, counterattacked the bourgeois "authorities'" attacks and slanders against workers, peasants, and soldiers' creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and criticized bad novels, bad movies, and bad plays. In the past month, the commanders and fighters have written more than 10,000 articles. These articles from the forward positions have a firm stand, clear love and hatred, sharp and pungent, and strong combat effectiveness. Like bayonets and bullets, they are fiercely aimed at the anti-Party, anti-socialist black gang, becoming a strong assault force in the Cultural Revolution. Many cadres and soldiers have also formed combat writing groups, writing many good articles with the level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. A brand-new proletarian theoretical team is being tempered and growing in this class struggle. Many leading cadres who went deep into the companies also wrote many poems, dances, scripts, and novels together with members of the cultural troupe and active members of the company's entertainment activities, praising Chairman Mao, praising the Cultural Revolution, and reflecting the struggle life of workers, peasants, and soldiers. After the leading cadres of a certain unit's political department went deep into the companies, they also performed on the same stage with the soldiers of the company, singing poetic recitations such as "The Red Sun in Our Hearts" and crosstalk such as "Hold the Fighting Pen and Gun." In the Socialist Cultural Revolution, the soldiers performed revolutionary plays and sang revolutionary songs, and the revolutionary spirit was further promoted.
    Recently, the leading organs above the division and regiment of the Fujian Front Troops have specially studied and discussed major issues such as strengthening the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology in the ideological field, realizing ideological revolutionization, and better implementing the principle of politics commanding military affairs and politics commanding everything, so that the five principles of highlighting politics are more implemented. The rolling tide of the Socialist Cultural Revolution has promoted the Fujian Front Troops to advance more rapidly along the road of extraordinary proletarianization and extraordinary combat effectiveness. The vast number of commanders and fighters are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and be the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat forever in the battles with real guns and ammunition and on the battlefield of the Cultural Revolution without gunfire.

    在阶级斗争的风浪中学习毛主席著作学得最透用得最活领会最深收获最大
    福建前线部队领导干部深入连队积极领导文化大革命
    新华社福建前线十二日电　中国人民解放军福建前线部队领导干部，纷纷深入连队，和广大战士一起学习毛主席著作，投入社会主义文化大革命，推动革命洪流滚滚向前发展。
    福建前线部队党委，把积极领导指战员参加社会主义文化大革命，作为当前部队突出政治，落实四好，加强战备的头等大事。许多领导干部亲自带领工作组，深入连队，他们首先狠抓组织战士学习毛主席著作，特别是反复阅读毛主席关于无产阶级专政、阶级斗争和文学艺术等方面的论著，同时又和战士们一起举行座谈，写文章，口诛笔伐，向反党反社会主义黑线猛烈开火，在斗争中更好地运用毛泽东思想。
    前线部队某部由宣传部、文化部干部组成的工作组，跋山涉水，深入偏远山区某雷达站，向战士们讲述当前社会主义文化大革命的形势，与战士们一起用毛泽东思想为武器，分析这场阶级斗争。在面对台湾海峡的炮兵阵地上，某炮兵团负责干部，和战士们一起着重讨论了“不拿枪的黑帮是怎样向党向社会主义进攻的？”“文人造反是不是成不了气候？”“拿枪杆子的战士，要不要掌握笔杆子？”“谁是文化的真正主人？”等问题，使战士们对当前阶级斗争的新形势、新特点和社会主义文化大革命的重大意义，有了更深刻的认识，眼睛更加明亮。战士们说，这伙黑帮虽然手里不拿刀，不拿枪，但比拿枪、拿刀的敌人更阴险、更毒辣，他们钻到我们肚子里，打着“红旗”反红旗，披着马列主义、毛泽东思想外衣，反对马列主义、毛泽东思想，用资本主义、修正主义的反动思想腐蚀我们的灵魂，想在中国复辟资本主义。我们人民战士，不仅要紧握枪杆，随时准备歼灭胆敢来犯的任何敌人，而且要时刻警惕不拿枪的敌人，粉碎他们在中国复辟资本主义的大阴谋。许多部队领导干部深入连队以后，还和战士们一起，把黑帮分子的黑话、黑文，同面前的敌人蒋匪帮的反动宣传一一对照，又用毛主席的教导作武器，分析批判。在学习毛主席著作讲用会上，战士们纷纷指出：黑帮和蒋帮，唱的是一个曲调。蒋匪帮在我们前面打明枪，黑帮在我们背后放暗箭，主子和奴才，一个鼻孔出气，都是地主资产阶级的代表，都是妄想推翻社会主义，重新骑到人民头上来作威作福。指战员们深刻体会到，在阶级斗争的风浪中学习毛主席著作，学得最透，用得最活，领会最深，收获最大，从而把部队学习毛主席著作的热潮，推向了一个新的高峰。
    福建前线部队许多领导干部深入连队，推动了部队社会主义文化大革命的洪流向前发展。现在，祖国东南海防线上的每一个哨所、战壕、海岛，每一艘舰艇和每一个机场，不仅是和拿枪的敌人作斗争的阵地，同时也都是文化大革命的战场。从这里发出的每一首诗，每一支歌，每一个声音，都是摧毁黑线、黑帮反动堡垒的炮弹和炸弹。在许多前沿阵地举行的批判大会上，干部战士一起振臂高呼：“向反党反社会主义黑帮开炮！向牛鬼蛇神开炮！”干部战士一同拿起笔杆，写文章，怒斥黑线、黑帮的罪行，反击资产阶级“权威”对工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的攻击和污蔑，批判坏小说、坏电影、坏戏，近一个月来，指战员们就写出了一万多篇文章。这些来自前沿阵地的文章，立场坚定，爱憎分明，尖锐泼辣，战斗性强，象刺刀、子弹，猛烈射向反党反社会主义黑帮，成为文化大革命中一支强大的突击力量。许多干部、战士还组成了战斗写作小组，写出了不少有马列主义、毛泽东思想水平的好文章，一支崭新的无产阶级理论队伍，正在这场阶级斗争中锤炼和成长。许多深入连队的领导干部，还和文工团员、连队文娱活动积极分子，一同挥笔编写了许多歌颂毛主席、赞扬文化大革命、反映工农兵斗争生活的诗歌、舞蹈、剧本、小说。某部政治部领导干部深入连队以后，还和连队战士同台演出自己编写的诗歌联唱《我们心中的红太阳》，对口词《紧握战斗的笔和枪》等节目。在社会主义文化大革命中，战士们大演革命戏，大唱革命歌，革命精神进一步大发扬。
    最近，福建前线部队师、团以上领导机关，专门研究讨论了加强意识形态领域中的兴无灭资斗争，实现思想革命化，和更好地贯彻政治统帅军事、政治统帅一切等重大问题，使突出五项原则更加落实。社会主义文化大革命的滚滚浪潮，推动了福建前线部队更加迅速地沿着非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路前进。广大指战员决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在真枪实弹的战斗中，在没有枪声、炮声的文化大革命战场上，永远做无产阶级的革命先锋。（附图片）
