　　Eliminating the Gap Between Cadres and the Masses
    Liujia Village Implements Grievance Airing to Fill the Void
    [Our newspaper, Pingshun News] Cadres and masses in Liujia Village, District One of this county, are strengthening unity and carrying out a "cutting off the tail and filling the hole" movement. At the beginning of this month, base point cadres from various districts were divided into groups to investigate various small villages and mountain settlements. They discovered that 47 peasant households in the entire village, especially in small mountain villages, had not yet turned over (i.e., had not had their land redistributed), and several landlords had not been thoroughly struggled against. Due to unfair distribution of fruits of struggle in the past and cadres protecting landlords, disunity formed between cadres and the masses, and between large and small villages, leaving many problems unresolved. Based on the above situation, the leadership first enlightened the cadre class to make them self-consciously examine themselves before the masses. Political Director Niu Luyou said: "During the mass movement in 1944, I protected the landlord Qin Laize and did not let the masses struggle against him." Farmers' Association Chairman Zhang Maohai said: "I also protected landlords in the past, hiding two large bundles for ××; I'm really sorry to everyone!" Old Village Chief Li Liexi said: "During the struggle in 1942, I privately bought seven more mu of land and more than a dozen sheep." Public Security Chief He Genhai said: "I forgot the masses after I myself turned over; I will return the two mu of land I bought in the past!" After the cadres made their self-criticisms, the leadership immediately asked the masses: "Are the cadres and us one family?" "Have the cadres contributed to us?" "Do the cadres have any merits?" After discussion, everyone recognized that cadres and the masses were one family, and in the past, all were oppressed and exploited. Some protected landlords because they were fooled by the landlords. As a result, the gap between cadres and the masses was eliminated, and a grievance airing movement was immediately launched. Liu Zhangshui said: "In the past, because I borrowed money from the landlord, I worked as a laborer for more than ten years and couldn't pay back the debt. As a result, I sold my son, and I still haven't turned over to this day..." He burst into tears before he could finish speaking. Liu Guoxing said: "In the past, I borrowed 20 yuan from landlord Cao Panren, and it impoverished me in three years. This time, I must thoroughly turn over and cut off the landlord's feudal tail!" Zhang Genze, an old hired laborer in his sixties, also painfully recounted his past exploitation and was determined to fill all the holes that hadn't been filled in the past. Currently, the grievance airing and void-filling movement is in full swing in the village. (Jiang Qunyou)

　　消除干部与群众隔阂
    刘家村实行诉苦填补
    【本报平顺讯】本县一区刘家村干部群众加强团结，正开展“割尾巴填窟窿”运动。本月初旬，各区基点干部分成小组分别到各小村与山庄调查，发现全村特别是山沟小庄尚有四十七户农民没有翻身，亦有几户地主没斗倒。由于过去果实分配不公，及干部包庇地主，形成干部与群众及大小村间的不团结现象，遗留问题甚多。根据以上情况，领导上首先启发干部阶级自觉，使之向群众自我检讨，政治主任牛路有说：“在四四年群运时我包庇了地主秦来则，没让群众斗争他。”农会主席张毛亥说：“我过去也包庇地主，给××藏了两个大包袱；真对不起大家！”旧村长李列喜说：“四二年斗争时，我私自多买了七亩地，十几只羊。”公安主任何根亥说：“我自己翻身忘了群众，过去多买的二亩地我退出来！”干部检讨后？领导上即向群众提出：“干部和咱是不是一家人？”“干部给咱出过力没有？”“干部有优点没有？”经过讨论，大家认识了干部群众是一家，过去都是受压迫剥削的，有的包庇地主是上了地主的当。结果干部群众隔阂消除，当即展开诉苦运动。刘张水说：“过去我因了借地主的钱，当了十几年工人还不了账，结果把儿子卖了，到如今我还没翻转身………”话语未完即痛哭失声。刘过兴说：“过去借地主曹畔仁二十元钱，三年就把我背穷了，这回一定要彻底翻身，把地主的封建尾巴割掉！”六十多岁的老雇工张根则亦痛诉过去受剥削的痛苦，决心把过去没填平的窟窿都填平。现该村诉苦填补运动正热烈进行中。（蒋群有）
