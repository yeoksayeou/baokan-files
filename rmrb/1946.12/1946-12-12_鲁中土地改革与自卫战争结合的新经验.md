New Experiences in Combining Land Reform and Self-Defense War in Central Shandong
    I. In the central area, only by carrying out land reform can we effectively support the front lines of the self-defense war. For example, in Yiyuan, it was difficult to mobilize laborers before the land reform, and those who were hired were not very active; however, after the land reform was completed, the masses volunteered to participate, and some hired laborers voluntarily returned their wages. X County also adopted a system of standing laborers, selecting one or two cadres from each district and one or two laborers from each village to form a stretcher transportation brigade, which was uniformly mobilized by the administrative office, serving in rotation for three months each term. This method not only meets the needs of the front line but also allows more than 90 percent of the farmers to carry out land reform with peace of mind. At the same time, it takes better care of the families of farmers who are serving, and frequently writes letters to the laborers to inform them of the land they have received, in order to enhance the laborers' enthusiasm. This system has been universally implemented in the central area of ​​central Shandong at the county level.
    II. In the border areas, we must do our best to repel attacks and harassment by Chiang's troops and secret agents, protect the interests of all strata, and carry out land reform. After the fruits are uniformly distributed, we must quickly expand the militia and unite to fight against the enemy. For general small and medium landlords, arbitration should be adopted, and some landlords voluntarily contribute land. A village in Anqiu repelled many attacks by Chiang's troops and secret agents, and all strata benefited from it. The landlords were also very grateful. In addition to contributing land, they also helped the militia buy guns, repair blockhouses, and dig fortifications, thereby strengthening the unity of all strata.
    III. In the Chiang-occupied areas or guerrilla areas where Chiang's troops have the upper hand, we should first use armed work teams to defeat their secret agent activities, destroy their regime, and arrest the most heinous tyrants by the democratic regime, pursue the fruits seized from the masses and return them to the masses, and then carry out land reform. For example, the land reform movement in a village in Boshan was carried out only after the armed work team defeated the secret agent activities.

    鲁中土地改革与自卫战争结合的新经验
    一、在中心区，只有进行土地改革才能有力的支持自卫战的前线。如沂源在土地改革之前，动员民夫甚感困难，雇佣的也多不积极；但在土地改革完成后，群众即自告奋勇参加，有些雇佣的民夫自动将工资退回。×县并采用民夫常备制，在每区抽调一、二干部，每村抽调一、二名民夫，组成担架运输大队，由行署统一调动，每期三月，轮流服务。此种办法既能满足前线需要，又能使百分之九十以上的农民安心进行土地改革，同时在工作中更加照顾出夫的农民家庭，经常把他家里收到土地的情形写信告诉民夫，以提高民夫的积极性。此种制度已在鲁中中心区以县为单位普遍实行。
    二、在边沿区必须一面全力打退蒋军及特务袭扰，保卫各阶层利益，一面进行土地改革，而果实统一分配后，须迅速扩大民兵，团结一致，对敌斗争。对一般中小地主宜采用仲裁方式，有些地主自愿献地。安邱某村曾将多次袭扰该村的蒋军特务打退，各阶层均蒙其利，地主们也很感谢，除献出田地外，还帮助民兵买枪修炮楼挖工事，因而加强了各阶层的团结。
    三、在蒋占区或蒋军占优势的游击区，应先以武工队打垮其特务活动，摧毁其政权，由民主政权将罪大恶极的奸霸加以逮捕，将其夺取的群众果实追出，退给群众以后，再进行土地改革。如博山某村土地改革运动由武工队打垮特务活动后才进行。
