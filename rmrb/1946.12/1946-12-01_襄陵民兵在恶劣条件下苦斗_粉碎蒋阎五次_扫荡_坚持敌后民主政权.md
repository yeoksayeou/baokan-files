　　Xiangling Militia Fight Bitterly in Harsh Conditions
  　Crushing Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's Five "Sweeps" and Persisting in the Democratic Regime Behind Enemy Lines
    [Report from Taiyue on the 28th] The Xiangling Guerrilla Force and militia, persisting in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, in close combination with the local people, have been fighting Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops on a land of more than 20 kilometers in length and width since September. They have continuously crushed Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's five "sweeps" and "encirclements," creating a model of persisting in guerrilla warfare and maintaining the democratic regime under harsh conditions. The Xiangling liberated area behind enemy lines is located within the layers of encirclement by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops from Zhoushan via Mengcheng, Shicun, Zhaoqu, to Fushan. On September 8, a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's troops from Shicun launched a "sweep," attempting to drive away our democratic regime in one fell swoop. They advanced no more than ten miles, and were repelled by the guerrillas and militia at Lizhuang. On September 14 and the morning of October 18, Chiang Kai-shek's troops transferred two regiments from Linfen, relying on their strong artillery fire, and advanced towards our Zhangzhai and other places in two routes. They were constantly subjected to ambushes and harassment by our guerrillas and militia along the way, and only reached Zhangzhai after noon, and then fled in panic. We then took advantage of the victory to pursue them to the vicinity of Shicun, killing and wounding more than ten enemies. On the 21st of last month, the enemy again transferred the Fourth Regiment of the 167th Brigade from Linfen to conduct zonal "sweeps" on our Xiangling guerrilla base area behind enemy lines. More than 200 members of Yan's puppet "Love the Country Corps" and "Comfort Group" in Zhangli, Zhaoqu and other strongholds also actively cooperated in the operation. The militia guerrillas ambushed the enemy everywhere. On the morning of the 23rd, more than 20 militiamen in Nanliang, District 1, ambushed a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's troops at Dadengzhuang, fighting for as long as six hours, killing and wounding nine enemies. This created a situation of "our army everywhere" and "gunfire everywhere." On the 28th, when the enemy was forced to retreat, our militia rushed to Chenzhuang and launched a surprise attack on a company of Yan's puppet "Comfort Group" that was retreating. The enemy was extremely panicked and abandoned the plundered property and fled. So far, Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's fourth sweep has failed again. On the 31st, the enemy's 167th Brigade and 67th Brigade attacked south from Xiangling in two routes, attempting to scare away our guerrilla forces, but were also completely crushed. In the past two months, the Xiangling guerrilla militia has fought a total of 97 battles, ensuring that the Xiangling Liberated Area has not lost an inch of land. Seven enemy personnel were captured alive including a Chiang Kai-shek army company political instructor and a Yan Xishan army lieutenant observer, fifty-one Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan army personnel were killed including a company commander, and fourteen rifles, three pistols, and countless other ammunition items were seized.

　　襄陵民兵在恶劣条件下苦斗
  　粉碎蒋阎五次“扫荡”坚持敌后民主政权
    【本报太岳二十八日电】我在敌后坚持游击战争的襄陵游击队与民兵，在当地人民密切结合下。自九月以来一直与蒋阎军转战于纵横二十余公里的土地上，连续粉碎了蒋阎军五次的“扫荡”与“清剿”，创造了在恶劣条件下，坚持游击战争，坚持民主政权的范例。襄陵敌后解放区，处于蒋阎军自舟山经蒙城、史村、赵曲、至浮山的层层包围圈内。九月八日，史村蒋军一个营出动“扫荡”，企图一举赶走我民主政权，前进不过十余里，至李庄即被游击队、民兵击退。九月十四日，及十月十八日晨，蒋军自临汾增调两团人，凭其强烈炮火，分两路向我张寨等地进犯，沿途不断受我游击队与民兵阻击袭扰，过午始抵张寨，旋即仓惶撤退。我则乘胜追至史村附近，毙伤敌十余名。上月二十一日敌又自临汾调来一六七旅第四团，再度向我襄陵敌后游击根据地进行分区“扫荡”，张礼、赵曲等据点阎伪“爱乡团”、“慰问组”二百余人，亦积极配合行动，民兵游击队，到处阻击敌人，一区南梁二十余民兵，二十三日晨于大邓庄，阻击蒋军一营之众，战斗达六小时之久，毙伤敌九名。形成“无处无我军”，“无处无枪声”之势，二十八日，敌无奈撤退时，我民兵其排奔赴陈庄，对后撤之阎伪“慰问组”一个连进行奇袭，敌极度慌乱，丢弃所掳掠财物逃窜。至此，蒋阎第四次扫荡又告失败。三十一日，敌一六七旅、六十七旅分两路由襄陵南犯，妄图吓退我游击部队，亦被彻底粉碎。总计两月来，我襄陵游击队民兵共作战九十七次，使襄陵解放区，未失寸土。生俘蒋军连指导员，阎军上尉观察员以下七名，击毙蒋阎军连长以下五十一名，缴获长枪十四支，短枪三支，其他弹药物品无算。
