　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 5th: Following the annihilation of more than 4,000 Chiang troops in Wangdu, north of the Pinghan Railway, another 2,500 Chiang troops were annihilated in the narrow area between Shenshui and Yi County from the 12th to the 17th of last month. On the day following Chiang Kai-shek's "Ceasefire Order" on November 11th, two regiments of the 121st Division of the 94th Army, besieged in Shenshui City, coordinated with the entire 5th Division of the 94th Army, the 116th Division of the 53rd Army, and two regiments of the 130th Division from the Pinghan and PingSui Railways, totaling about ten regiments. Under the cover of American-made airplanes and artillery, they once again launched a fierce attack on Yi County City along a sixty-mile-wide front. On the 15th, the Chiang army's American-equipped 5th Division, which was responsible for the main attack, invaded the area of the East Gate Dunzi Mountain in Yi County and was met with a strong counterattack by the Eighth Route Army stationed there. Its regimental headquarters reconnaissance company and the 13th Regiment's search platoon were annihilated within ten minutes. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the division suffered heavy casualties. By the 17th, the Chiang army urgently dispatched its left-wing 130th Division to reinforce it, and then seized the opportunity to flee back to Shenshui City in a panic. The Chiang army that invaded Yi County also collapsed and retreated in separate routes. In this battle, a total of more than 2,000 Chiang troops were killed or wounded, more than 500 were captured alive, and the battle results are still being verified.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 5th: Military News: Two battalions of Fu Zuoyi's Provisional 11th Division in Gui Sui, in coordination with a cavalry regiment, launched an attack on the Eighth Route Army's garrison in Dong-Xi-Men Ge Temple, southwest of Taolin, via Qixiaying on the 30th of last month. After a day of fierce fighting, one battalion of Fu Zuoyi's infantry and one machine gun company, totaling four companies, were annihilated. More than 350 enemies were captured, more than 50 Fu Zuoyi troops were killed or wounded, and four mortars, six small cannons, eight heavy machine guns, and many other military supplies were seized.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: The Chiang army, which violated the agreement and occupied Yangdachengzi, southwest of Nong'an, has recently been constantly encroaching. A certain unit of the Liaoji Second Military Sub-district of the Liberated Area rose up in counterattack on the 29th of last month and recovered the area. The Chiang and puppet troops fled to the northeast upon hearing the news. A unit of the local armed forces of the Liaoji 15th Military Sub-district annihilated more than 100 members of the Chiang-backed bandit Zhang Nianzu's unit, who were committing crimes in Zhalanyingzi, west of Kailu, north of Rehe, on the 19th of last month, and seized one small cannon and more than 30 rifles.
