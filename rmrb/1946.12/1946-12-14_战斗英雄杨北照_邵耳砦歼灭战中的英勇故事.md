    Battle Hero Yang Beizhao
    ——The Heroic Story of the Annihilation Battle of Shaoerzhai
    Hu Qi
    The enemies in Shaoerzhai were sleeping soundly, and our troops quietly arrived. When the people saw it was their own, they gently clapped their hands and said, "Oh my dear! We've been waiting for you!" Then they poured out endless grievances. Even the girls with braids, in their soft, hoarse voices, recounted how Chiang Kai-shek's troops colluded with the local despotic landlords to bury the Women's Federation Chairman alive! And how they hung and beat the Children's Corps members! ... As they spoke and listened, everyone quietly shed tears.

    Yang Beizhao, the third platoon leader of the tenth company of a certain unit, was from Lin County. He used to be a poor man in the old society. He had been hung and beaten by the 40th Army, and he had also suffered the meanness of the despotic landlord Jia Zhenjin. Tonight, seeing the people tell so many sad things, he felt bitter. He couldn't help but think of the sins his family suffered when they fled to Shanxi when he was a child. In the end, his mother didn't even get to see her home, and died on the way! Yang Beizhao was a simple and honest man. He didn't like to shed tears, and tonight was no exception. Some people said he was hard-hearted, but he shook his head and said, "It's better to be hard-hearted. Crying won't kill the enemy." As dawn approached, the troops began to attack the enemy in Shaoerzhai. The tenth company was the reserve force and stayed behind to rest. From the first shot, Yang Beizhao pricked up his ears to listen to the artillery fire in front. The people invited him to drink water, but he had no heart to drink. Several times he was eager to try and clamored to go to the front, but since he didn't receive an order from his superiors, he could only wait and hope, until it was almost dark, the tenth company then went up. Yang Beizhao was waiting for the attack order, but the company commander only ordered the first and second platoons to make the main attack. The enemy had built very strong fortifications in Shaoerzhai. Just the machine gun firepower network alone was like a venomous snake winding and dancing, making it difficult to approach. The first and second platoons charged up, losing two squads. Company Commander Yang Jincai was still commanding in the fierce artillery fire. The soldiers set up planks to continue the attack, but when the soldiers walked to the middle of the planks, the planks broke, and some more people were injured. Company Commander Yang didn't lose heart, he ordered Yang Beizhao: "We've sacrificed twenty-six comrades, you must complete this task no matter what." Yang Beizhao nodded and replied: "Don't worry, leave it to me. I won't come back if I don't complete the task." After he finished speaking, he took six grenades and walked in front, and soldier Liu Xinfu followed with a basket of grenades. Then seven soldiers with guns, and four soldiers carrying machine gun ammunition boxes also ran up. The tighter the enemy's firepower, the steadier Yang Beizhao's courage. Just as they reached the side of the deep ditch, the firepower of five machine guns on the city wall secretly blocked his path. Yang Beizhao didn't panic and threw the grenades one by one. Firelight rose everywhere on the city wall, gradually spreading into a sheet. When the enemy's firepower stopped, Yang Beizhao's grenades were also used up. Before long, the enemy's firepower was even fiercer than before. Just as it was extremely urgent, soldier Liu Xinfu rushed up with another basket of grenades. Yang Beizhao forced his way forward while throwing grenades. With great difficulty, he approached the base of the city wall when the enemy threw a Molotov cocktail. Yang Beizhao was instantly covered in flames and rolled around on the ground. Soldier Liu Xinfu had no experience and thought Yang Beizhao was finished. He turned around to call the seventh squad leader, but Yang Beizhao said: "It's okay, I'm still fine." After the fire was put out, Liu Xinfu alone set up a ladder, and Yang Beizhao, still smoldering, climbed up the city wall. Machine gunner Dong Fusheng also climbed the city wall, and he opened fire to cover Yang Beizhao's advance. Yang Beizhao was moving forward with all his might, when he saw a figure flash in front of him and disappear. He ran over but encountered a hidden bunker. Yang Beizhao didn't hesitate and jumped in. He dragged a enemy out of the bunker, the enemy kowtowing like pounding garlic, and handed over a Type 79 machine gun. Before long, the soldiers rushed up like a tide. The enemies in every hidden bunker and every house couldn't withstand our powerful attack and surrendered their guns. When Yang Beizhao walked alone into a dark room to capture prisoners, he was hugged tightly by a group of people. Yang Beizhao vigilantly pulled the firing pin on the grenade, and the group of people cried out in trembling voices, "Good people, good people, if you hadn't come, we would have all been harmed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops!" When Yang Beizhao heard this miserable voice, he knew that they were the people who had suffered torture. This honest man couldn't help but shed tears again.

    战斗英雄杨北照
    ——邵耳砦歼灭战中的英勇故事
    胡奇
    邵耳砦的敌人正在睡觉，队伍就悄悄开到了。老百姓一看见是自己人，就轻轻的拍着手道：“我的亲娘呀！可等上你们了。”接着就是连连诉说不完的怨屈。连拖着辫子的闺女们，也用细哑的声音，诉说着蒋介石队伍如何跟恶霸地主串通起来，活埋了妇救主席！吊打了儿童团员！……说着，听着，大家都悄悄的流下眼泪。
    某部十连三排长杨北照，是林县人，过去在旧社会里也是穷光蛋，他受过四十军的吊打，也受过恶霸地主贾真金的刻薄。今夜，他见到老百姓说了这么多伤心的事，他也苦辣辣的，不由的想起小时候一家人逃到山西遭受的那些罪来。末了，他娘连家门也没看上，就在半路上死了！杨北照是个憨直人，他不大愿意流眼泪，今夜晚他也没有例外。有人说他心肠硬，他却摆摆头说：“还是心肠硬些好，哭也要不了敌人的命。”天快黎明的时候，队伍开始向邵耳砦的敌人攻击。十连是预备队，留在后边休息着。从第一枪起，杨北照就竖起耳朵听着前面的炮火声，老百姓招呼他喝水，他也无心喝，有几次他跃跃欲试吵着到前边去，可是上级没有命令，他只好等着盼着，直盼到天擦黑，十连才开了上去。杨北照正等着攻击命令，连长偏偏只叫一二排主攻。敌人在邵耳砦筑了非常坚固的工事，单说那机枪火力网就像一条条的毒蛇般的绕着舞着，使人难以接近，一二排冲锋上去，损伤了两个班，连长杨金才还是在猛烈的炮火中指挥着。战士搭好跳板，继续攻上去，可是战士走到跳板中间，跳板折断了，一下子又损伤了一些人，杨连长不灰心，他就命令杨北照道：“咱牺牲二十六个同志了，无论如何你要完成这个任务。”杨北照点点头，答道：“放心吧，包在我身上了，不完成任务我就不回来。”他说完话，就拿了六个手榴弹走在前面，战士刘新福又提着一篮子手榴弹跟了上去。接着七个持枪的战士，四个拿机枪扛子弹匣的战士也跑着上去，敌人火力越紧，杨北照的胆子越稳。刚走到深沟旁边，城墙上五挺机枪的火力，把他的进路秘密封锁住了，杨北照不慌不忙，把手榴弹一个一个地摔上去。城墙上火光四起，渐渐蔓延成一片，等敌人火力停了下来，杨北照的手榴弹也摔光了，不一会敌人火力比以前更猛烈了，正当万分紧急，战士刘新福又提了一篮子手榴弹冲上来，杨北照就且扔且进的逼上去，好容易才逼近城墙根时，敌人投下一个燃烧弹，杨北照登时满身着火，躺在地上乱滚。战士刘新福没经验过，以为杨北照这下可完了，他回过头正叫七班长，杨北照说：“不要紧，我还好好的哩。”火扑灭了，刘新福一个人早架起梯子，杨北照满身还冒着青烟，就攀登上城墙，机枪射手董富升也登上城墙，他展开火力掩护着杨北照前进。杨北照正一股劲前进，看见前面人影一幌就不见了，奔过去却碰到一座暗堡，杨北照毫不犹豫地纵身跳进去，一个敌人被他死拉活拉的，提了出来，敌人叩头如捣蒜，交出一挺七九式机枪。一会战士们一个个都如潮水般的涌上来了，每座暗堡每座房屋里的敌人，都吃不住我们的有力的攻击，统统的缴了枪。当杨北照一个人走进一座黑洞洞的屋子里去抓俘虏时，他被一群人紧紧地搂住了，杨北照机警的拉着手榴弹上的拉火线，那群人抖着声音哭诉说：“好人啦，好人啦，你们再不来我们统统都要给蒋介石的队伍坑害死了！”杨北照听了这个凄惨的声音，知道是受尽折磨的老百姓，这个耿直人由不得又濮滴濮滴的流下眼泪来。
