　　Gao Ping Strives to Complete Investigation and Reduction of Rent by the End of the Old Lunar Year; Formulates Measures to Care for Farmers Who Fled Disaster and Have Not Returned
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated the 16th] After more than two months of the rent reduction movement, Gao Ping, based on the situation in the entire county, plans to complete the land reform entirely by the end of the old lunar year. The handling methods for filling in and supplementing several special issues are introduced below: 1. For households who fled due to famine, even if they did not participate in the struggle, each village should take care of them, allocate land to them, and the government will manage it on their behalf, to be cultivated after they return to their hometowns. 2. For retired soldiers, military dependents, and families of martyrs who are poor, they should receive twice as much as middle peasants when dividing the fruits of labor. Those belonging to the landlord class should be left with land for living exceeding that of middle peasants by one to two times. 3. Small and medium landlords should retain land, draught animals, and farm tools equivalent to those of middle peasants. 4. Extremely poor peasants who have engaged in tyrannical behavior in the past should also be allocated land, temporarily managed by the government on their behalf, and given to them for cultivation after they change. 5. Petty puppet army personnel who have repented and joined our army should also be allocated land to encourage them to become rich through hard work. 6. Families of stubborn KMT soldiers must also be allocated land to encourage their family members to return home.

　　高平争取
    旧历年底完成查减
    订出办法照顾逃灾未返农民
    【本报太岳十六日电】高平经过两月余查减运动，根据全县情况，计划旧历年底全部完成土地改革。兹将填平补齐几个特殊问题的处理办法介绍于下：一、因灾荒而逃亡户，虽未参加斗争，各村亦应照顾，分配给土地，由政府代管，待其返乡后耕种。二、对于荣退军人、军属、烈属如系贫苦者，在分果实时应比中农多一倍，属于地主成份者，应留给生活土地超过中农一倍至二倍。三、对中小地主应留相当于中农的土地与耕牛及农具。四、对过去曾有恶霸行为的赤贫农，亦应分得土地，暂由政府代管，待其转变后再给耕种。五、对小伪匪人员，已反悔参加我军者，同样应分得土地，促其勤劳致富。六、对于顽军家属，亦须分得土地，争取其家人返乡。
