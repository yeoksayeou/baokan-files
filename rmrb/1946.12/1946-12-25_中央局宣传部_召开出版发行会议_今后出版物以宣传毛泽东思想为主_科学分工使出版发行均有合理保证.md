　　[This Newspaper Reports] In order to understand the publishing and distribution situation in the border area, exchange publishing and distribution opinions, and promptly solve difficulties in publishing and distribution work, the Propaganda Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau convened a meeting of publishing and distribution departments at the border area level again on the 22nd (the first meeting was held on the 23rd of last month). More than ten representatives from Xinhua Bookstore, People's Daily, Yongxing Printing Company, Border Government Printing Plant, Border Region Government, Military Region Political Department, Headquarters, and Post Office attended. Extensive and in-depth discussions were conducted on future publishing and distribution work in the border area. Regarding the publishing policy, the focus was on reviewing the past problem of producing many things without a clear direction and with generally ordinary content. The proposed future policy is to prioritize quality, producing less but producing well. All books and periodicals should have rich content and their own characteristics. Every book and periodical published must clearly promote Mao Zedong Thought. Under this policy, some publications should be streamlined in order to concentrate efforts on running several publications with a large readership and correspondents. The publishing departments, especially the Xinhua Bookstore, should primarily supply various reading materials to improve cadres. Popular reading materials should only be a part of the publications, and the main supply of popular reading materials should be resolved by the propaganda departments of each district according to the needs of the local masses. Second, there is the issue of ensuring the timely publication of newspapers and periodicals. In the past, the publishing and printing strength of various departments in the border area was not well organized, resulting in chaotic publishing and difficulty in guaranteeing the printing time of books and periodicals. Therefore, this meeting made precise calculations of the typesetting capacity of each printing plant and carried out scientific division of labor, so that the printing of publications of various departments in the future can be reasonably guaranteed on time. Third, after various reading materials are printed, how to quickly deliver them to the vast number of readers is the issue of distribution. At this meeting, a detailed discussion was also held on the postal distribution issue in the border area. Due to the transportation difficulties in the border area and the insufficient transportation capacity of the post office, many practical difficulties existed in the postal distribution work in the past. These difficulties are currently being studied and resolved by the leadership with the post office to ensure that the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in the future is done better. Finally, everyone felt that this kind of meeting for jointly studying problems and solving problems is of great help to the publishing and distribution work in the border area. Therefore, it was decided to hold one every month in the future, so that the publishing and distribution work in the border area can be done better.

　　中央局宣传部
    召开出版发行会议
    今后出版物以宣传毛泽东思想为主
    科学分工使出版发行均有合理保证
    【本报讯】为了解边区出版发行状况，交换出版发行意见，并及时解决出版发行工作中的困难，晋冀鲁豫中央局宣传部，特于廿二日，再次召开边区一级的出版发行部门会议（第一次会议在上月廿三日举行）到新华书店、人民日报、永兴印刷公司、边府印刷厂、边区政府、军区政治部、司令部、邮政局等代表十余人。对于今后边区出版发行工作，进行了广泛深入的讨论。关于出版方针方面，着重检讨了过去无明确方向东西出得多，内容一般化的毛病，并提出了今后的方针主要是求精，是出得少出得好，各种书刊都要有丰富内容并具有自己的特点。出版的每种书刊，必须明确的去宣传毛泽东思想，在这样的方针下，有些刊物就应当精简，以便集中力量，去办好几种拥有广大读者和通讯员的刊物。出版的各部门，特别是新华书店，应主要是供给提高干部的各种读物，通俗读物只是出版物的一部分，通俗读物主要的供给应由各区宣传部门根据当地群众的需要去解决。其次是保证书报按时出版问题，过去边区各部的出版印刷力量，由于未能很好的组织，致出版紊乱，书刊印刷时间，很难保证，因此这次会议，对各印刷厂排印能力都作了精确的计算，科学进行了分工，使今后各部出版物的印刷，得到了合理的按期出版的保证。第三、各种读物印出后，怎样迅速的把它送到广大读者的手里，那就是发行的问题了。此次会议，对边区邮政发行问题，也作了详尽的讨论，由于边区交通的困难，邮局运输力的不足，因此过去邮递发行工作中，存在着许多实际的困难，这些困难，现正由领导方面向邮局进行研究解决，以保证今后书报发行的工作，做得更好。最后，大家感到，这样共同研究问题，解决问题的会议，对于边区出版发行工作，有极大的帮助，因此决定今后每月举行一次，以便使今后边区的出版发行工作，搞得更好。
