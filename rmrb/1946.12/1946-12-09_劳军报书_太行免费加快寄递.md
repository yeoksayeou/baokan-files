　　Comforting the Troops with Books
    Taihang Offers Free and Expedited Delivery
    [This Newspaper reports] In response to the book and newspaper campaign to comfort the troops, the Taihang Postal Administration has decided: 1. All books and newspapers, whether self-collected or collected by others, will be delivered free of charge as long as they are marked "Comfort Goods" on the cover; 2. All bureaus and stations must give priority to the transportation of "Comfort Goods" and must not allow them to be backlogged. (Taihang Post)
    [This Newspaper, Weixian, 7th dispatch] The Julu County Committee, the Transportation Bureau, the district committees, and the heads of the National Salvation Association held a meeting to study how to improve the distribution of the Jinnan Daily. In the past, villages often did not see the newspaper, and subscriptions to the newspaper from the Transportation Bureau decreased, greatly affecting the Jinnan Daily's propaganda and education role among the masses. After examining the reasons, it was found that the Transportation Bureau did not distribute the newspaper in a timely manner, the districts did not have dedicated personnel responsible, and the postal agencies did not deliver the newspaper to the villages. Therefore, it was decided to divide each district into a dozen or so small areas and appoint dedicated personnel to uniformly distribute the newspaper, with the Transportation Bureau paying the dedicated personnel 10% of the distribution profits as remuneration.

　　劳军报书
    太行免费加快寄递
    【本报讯】太行各地邮政管理局响应书报劳军运动，总局决定：一、无论自募或别人募的书报，只要封面上写明“慰劳品”，一律免费寄递；二、各局站必须尽先运送“慰劳品”，不得积压。（太行邮报）
    【本报威县七日电】巨鹿县委会、交通局、各区委及救国会主任集会，研究改善冀南日报发行工作。过去各村往往看不到报纸，向交通局订报的日益减少，大大影响冀报对群众宣传教育作用。检查原因，系交通局分报不及时，区里没有专人负责，邮政代办所没有把报送到各村。于是决定各区划为十几个小区，设专人统一发报，交通局将发行红利百分之十酬予专人。
