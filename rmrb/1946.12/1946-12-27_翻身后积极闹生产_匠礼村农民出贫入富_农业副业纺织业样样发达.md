　　After Turning Over, Actively Engage in Production
    Jiangli Village Peasants Escape Poverty and Become Prosperous
    Agriculture, Sideline Occupations, and the Textile Industry Are All Well-Developed
    [Report from our newspaper in Taiyue on the 23rd] The peasants of Jiangli Village in the third district of Yangcheng, with high morale after liberation, have achieved self-sufficiency in food and clothing through one year of production. In the past, Jiangli Village suffered from the relentless destruction of the Kuomintang and Japanese invaders, plunging it into a bottomless pit of poverty. Before the war, all twelve brick kilns, five coal kilns, four flour mills, three steamed bun shops, two general stores, as well as the dyeing workshops, sugar mills, iron forges, and mills in the village were destroyed. Until 1942, when the Eighth Route Army arrived, two-tenths of the village's land remained barren. Out of 469 households, poor peasants and poverty-stricken peasants accounted for 215 households, nearly half of the total population. The number of livestock decreased from 373 to 93, a loss of three-quarters. After liberation, the village was swept up in the movement to denounce grievances and seek revenge, carrying out land reform. By April of this year, the principle of "land to the tiller" had been basically realized. Among the 215 poor peasant and poverty-stricken households, poverty has been completely eliminated, with only 14 poor peasant households remaining. Middle and rich peasants have increased to 95 percent. With land in their hands, the peasants' production enthusiasm soared, integrating agricultural, sideline, and even industrial and commercial production. The ten-person production mutual aid team organized by Yang Chuntian has now grown to 38 mutual aid teams. Among the 1,080 able-bodied men and women, 784 have been organized, accounting for 74 percent of the total labor force, and they are committed to long-term mutual assistance. Under the leadership of the district's militia hero, Ye Mingzhu, the village has become a model village for supporting the front lines. In July of this year, when Chiang's army invaded Yicheng, the entire district launched a campaign of 100,000 people to rush military supplies. Of the 521 able-bodied men in Jiangli Village, 379 participated in the rush transport. At that time, it was the height of the autumn harvest, so the mutual aid teams organized semi-able-bodied laborers and completed the harvest of more than 5,000 mu of crops in just four days. In addition, over a hundred people enthusiastically joined the Eighth Route Army to defend the fruits of their liberation. Now, in addition to completely eliminating the barren land of the past, the entire village has reclaimed another 143 mu of wasteland. After the autumn harvest this year, the average grain yield per person is three big dan (approximately 300 liters). The average cotton harvest per person this year is four jin (approximately 2 kilograms), plus the 360,000 yuan profit earned from transportation from February to June, and the cooperative's dividend of over 500,000 yuan after the autumn harvest, each person can receive another 500 yuan. In the winter, all the women in the village have organized 20 textile groups, with 440 people engaged in textile work, earning a profit of 230,000 yuan. In addition, there are various sideline production profits led by the cooperative, including two general stores, two medicine shops, two iron forges, one rope shop, three coal kilns, and one each of earthenware kiln, bowl kiln, and landmine kiln, one dyeing workshop, one cotton ginning workshop, one knitting machine, and one each of flour mill and tofu workshop, with a capital of over one million yuan. Now, through the implementation of "land to the tiller" and large-scale production, the village has achieved self-sufficiency in food and clothing.
