　　Taihang First Prefectural Committee Directs:
    Strengthening Militia Education in Winter Studies
    [This newspaper’s Changzhi dispatch] The CCP Taihang First Prefectural Committee recently instructed all county committees to strengthen militia education in this year's winter studies. The instruction stated: Old area militia have developed thoughts of underestimating the enemy and complacency due to the victory in the eight-year arduous War of Resistance; the new area militia have poorer awareness, and although greatly reformed, individual areas are still controlled by feudal landlords, treacherous bullies, and special agents. To ensure the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, it is necessary to consolidate the militia ideologically and organizationally. Therefore, "Strengthening the political education of the militia and improving combat skills should be the central task of this winter's patriotic self-defense education for the militia." In the old areas, the militia should be further reformed in the production movement, and in the new areas, the militia should be reformed in the land reform review, organizing the militia to reflect on themselves and closely connect with the masses, so that they truly become the peasants' own armed forces for liberation. Militia instructors should personally participate in the leadership of winter studies to ensure the completion of this task. (Zhang Guohua)

　　太行一地委指示
    冬学中加强民兵教育
    【本报长治电】中共太行一地委顷指示各县委在今年冬学中加强民兵教育。指示称：老区民兵由于八年艰苦抗战已获胜利，产生了轻敌麻痹思想；新区民兵觉悟较差，虽有极大改造，但个别地区仍有为封建地主、奸霸特务掌握的现象。为确保爱国自卫战的胜利，必须从思想上组织上巩固民兵。因此，“加强民兵政治教育，提高作战技术，应为今冬民兵爱国自卫教育的中心课题。”老区在生产运动中、新区在翻身检查中都应进一步的改造民兵，组织民兵反省，密切与群众的连系，以期真正成为农民群众自己的翻身武装。民兵指导员应亲自参加冬学领导，以确切保证这一任务的完成。（张国华）
