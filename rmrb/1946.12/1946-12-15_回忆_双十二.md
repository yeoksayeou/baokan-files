    Remembering the "Double Twelve"
    Shen Bochun
    Editor's Note: The author, Mr. Shen Bochun, was the Director of the Political Department of the 17th Route Army under the command of General Yang Hucheng during the "Double Twelve" Incident. After the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the Secretary-General of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters and the Speaker of the Shanxi-Hebei-Henan Border Region Provisional Assembly and the Assembly.

    I personally participated in the "Double Twelve" Incident. Now I will roughly talk about some of the real situation of Chiang Kai-shek at that time based on my recollections.

  I. Forced to the Edge.

    How did the "Double Twelve" Incident break out? It's very simple; Chiang Kai-shek forced it. Since the "September 18th" Incident, because Japan was advancing step by step, trying to destroy all of China, Chiang Kai-shek retreated externally and refused to resist, but internally carried out large-scale "Communist suppression" civil war, massacring the people. The people of the whole country really couldn't bear it anymore. By 1935 and 1936, the slogan of "Stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan" had become a universal demand of the broad masses of the people. This view also influenced the army at that time. Generals Zhang and Yang accepted this view and, in the spring of 1936, successively reached a truce with the Red Army in northern Shaanxi, secretly signing a non-aggression and anti-Japanese friendship agreement. At the same time, they conducted in-depth anti-Japanese education in the Northeast Army and the 17th Route Army. In the summer of that year, the Guangdong Incident broke out. Chiang Kai-shek then mobilized the country's troops to fight Guangdong. Hu Zongnan's troops in the Northwest were also transferred. At that time, Generals Zhang and Yang attempted to jointly organize a Northwest Anti-Japanese Allied Army with the Red Army and march east to resist Japan. Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek quickly destroyed the Guangdong Incident by using divisive tactics. After the Guangdong Incident ended, Chiang Kai-shek believed that anti-Japanese sentiment was brewing in the Northwest and that the situation was serious. So he personally led two or three hundred thousand troops to Shaanxi. Chiang Kai-shek stopped his troops on the Pinghan and Longhai lines and went to Xi'an first, announcing that anti-Japanese activities were not allowed and that the plan to thoroughly "suppress the Communists" would continue. He also pressured Zhang and Yang, presenting them with two options: First, obey the "Communist suppression" order and send the entire Northeast Army and the 17th Route Army to the front line in northern Shaanxi to attack the Red Army, with the Central Army providing support and supervision from behind. Second, if Zhang and Yang were unwilling to fight a civil war, the Northeast Army would be transferred to Fujian, and the 17th Route Army to Anhui, ceding the two provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu to the Central Army for their own "Communist suppression." Both of these options were absolutely unacceptable to Zhang and Yang. According to the first option, not only were Zhang and Yang unwilling to fight, but the troops below were also unwilling to fight, because long-term friendly contact with the Red Army and internal anti-Japanese education had made the Northeast Army and the 17th Route Army unable to fight a civil war. According to the second option, Zhang and Yang knew very well that leaving the Northwest and leaving the Red Army would mean the departure of the Zhang and Yang's forces as well, which was tantamount to throwing themselves into a trap and courting their own destruction, inevitably becoming the second Nineteenth Route Army and Fang Zhenwu. However, Chiang Kai-shek gave Zhang and Yang only these two options, with no other room for compromise. At this time, the Central Army was pressing the border, entering Shaanxi one after another. Chiang Kai-shek lived in Huaqing Pool, arrogant and menacing, forcing Zhang and Yang to make a final decision. Forced to the end, they were forced to Liangshan, capturing Chiang Kai-shek alive and triggering the "Double Twelve" Incident.

  II. "Even if you shoot me dead with a pistol now, my Communist suppression policy cannot be changed!"

    On December 7th, under the aforementioned circumstances, Generals Zhang and Yang were forced by Chiang Kai-shek to the point of having no choice. Finally, General Zhang Xueliang had a "weeping remonstrance" idea, wanting to use the principle of "stopping the civil war and uniting to resist Japan" to "weeping remonstrance" to Chiang Kai-shek with a do-or-die attitude, hoping to move him and persuade him. That afternoon, Zhang personally went to Huaqing Pool to see Chiang, dismissing his attendants and painfully stating that the Communist Party's current policy was to prioritize national resistance against Japan and that the Red Army issue could be resolved through political methods. He also strongly argued that the troops' anti-Japanese sentiment was high and could not be suppressed, etc. Chiang Kai-shek was furious upon hearing this, scolding Zhang for being young and ignorant and being misled by the Communist Party. Zhang repeatedly "bitterly remonstrated," followed by tearful "weeping remonstrances." The two fiercely argued for three hours. Finally, Chiang Kai-shek slammed the table and loudly said, "Even if you shoot me dead with a pistol now, my Communist suppression policy cannot be changed!" Zhang, hearing this, knew that this last resort was also futile. That night, he returned to Xi'an and said to Yang in his first sentence, "Failed." So the two secretly plotted to detain Chiang first and then demand an end to the civil war and a united resistance against Japan. On the 8th, Xi'an students marched in formation towards Huaqing Pool to petition Chiang. Chiang learned of this news and immediately personally called Zhang Xueliang, ordering him to stop them and forbidding the students from coming to Huaqing Pool. If the students refused to be stopped, he ordered the troops to suppress them, repeatedly saying to "kill without mercy." General Zhang Xueliang, after receiving the call, personally drove to chase the students, chasing them to Gouqiao. Zhang persuaded the students to return, but the students refused. Zhang said indignantly, "Go back! Within three days, I will have facts for you to see!" The students then returned in formation.

  III. Falling into a mountain hollow.

    At 5:00 AM on December 12th, gunshots rang out at the gate of Huaqing Pool. Dozens of "Imperial Guards" that Chiang Kai-shek brought with him hurriedly got up to resist, and a fierce battle unfolded in the Huaqing Pool courtyard. Chiang Kai-shek woke up from his sleep in shock and hurriedly got out of bed, not even having time to put on his clothes and shoes. He fled from the back door of Huaqing Pool in his pajamas and bare feet. Emerging from the back door, in the dim light, he stumbled and ran towards Phoenix Mountain, running for about half a mile. He lost his footing and fell into a mountain hollow with vertical walls about seven or eight feet deep. His spine was injured, and his face was scratched. The mountain hollow was covered with weeds, so Chiang Kai-shek took the opportunity to dive into the grass, like a pheasant, paying attention to his head but not his rear. The Northeast Army soldiers who were capturing Chiang Kai-shek searched for him everywhere in Huaqing Pool. A battalion commander, very carefully, went to Chiang Kai-shek's residence and felt that the quilt Chiang had covered was still warm, and Chiang Kai-shek's dentures were on the table, knowing that Chiang Kai-shek could not have run far. So he searched the small mountain and suddenly saw someone crouching in the weeds in the mountain hollow. He shouted, "Who's there!" Chiang Kai-shek had no choice at this time and tremblingly crawled out of the grass, repeatedly asking, "What army are you? What army are you?" When he realized it was the Northeast Army, he pretended to sit down and stubbornly refused to come up on his own. The officers and soldiers of the Northeast Army saw that it was Chiang Kai-shek and went down to drag him up, carried him to a car, and escorted him to the Xincheng Building in Xi'an.

  IV. Although wearing the adjutant's clothes, the adjutant still refused to hand over the list.

    At 8:00 AM, Chiang Kai-shek was escorted to the Xincheng Building, still wearing his pajamas and bare feet. Although Bai Fengxiang, the regimental commander, kindly took off his leather coat and gave it to Chiang Kai-shek to wear along the way. The guards of the Xincheng Building that night were the Gendarmerie Battalion of the Sui Jinggong Office, and the ones serving Chiang Kai-shek were several trusted adjutants of General Yang Hucheng. The first thing the adjutants did was to find a complete set of new clothes, shoes, and socks to give to Chiang Kai-shek to wear. The adjutants said, "This is what Director Yang sent to the Chairman, please change your clothes!" Chiang Kai-shek, upon hearing this, repeatedly said, "I won't wear it, I won't wear the clothes Director Yang sent me." The adjutants had no choice and guessed Chiang Kai-shek's psychology. So they took the clothes out and immediately brought them back, saying to Chiang Kai-shek, "This is what we bought for the Chairman with our own money, please wear it!" Chiang Kai-shek immediately said upon hearing this, "Ah! You bought it for me, I'll wear it, I'll wear it!" After putting on his clothes, Chiang Kai-shek pretended to be very amiable and said to the adjutants, "We are now friends in adversity. What are your names? Give me a list, and I will carry it with me. I will never forget your kindness to me in the future." Chiang Kai-shek's goal was to buy off these adjutants, but these adjutants never gave him the list.

  V. Misunderstanding the kindness of moving, shivering under the covers.

    After staying for about two or three days, Generals Zhang and Yang thought that it was a bit inconvenient for Chiang Kai-shek to live in the Xincheng Building, so they specially cleaned up the residence of Gao Guizi, opposite the Deputy Commander's residence, as Chiang Kai-shek's residence. That night at 11:00 PM, General Zhang Xueliang sent Sun Mingjiu, the battalion commander of his guard, to pick up Chiang Kai-shek. Battalion Commander Sun had a revolver stuck in his belt on his chest. He entered the Xincheng Building and said to Chiang Kai-shek, "Reporting to the Chairman! It's not convenient to live here. The Deputy Commander has prepared a good place for the Chairman. Please move there with me immediately!" Chiang Kai-shek saw the pistol stuck in Sun Mingjiu's chest, and it was late at night. Also, he was told to leave immediately with him. He mistakenly thought they were going to execute him. His face changed, and he trembled all over. The dentures in his mouth clattered up and down. So he staggered a few steps, swayed, and fell on the bed, covering his head with the quilt, and said, "This is a public place. I won't go anywhere else. Let me die here!" Battalion Commander Sun repeatedly explained to him, but he kept shivering under the covers.

  VI. Watching "a play within a play," crying with a twisted face.

    After the Xi'an Incident broke out, there were two factions within the Nanjing Kuomintang government: One faction, headed by He Yingqin, advocated ignoring Chiang Kai-shek's life or death and issuing a clear order to suppress Zhang and Yang, first bombing Xi'an flat with airplanes. This was because He wanted to take this opportunity to kill Chiang Kai-shek and replace him. The other faction, headed by Soong Mei-ling, advocated not issuing a punitive order first, nor bombing Xi'an with airplanes, but trying to send someone to Xi'an first to see the specific situation and find a way to rescue Chiang Kai-shek. The struggle between these two views was very intense. He Yingqin did not listen to Soong Mei-ling's proposal and immediately issued a punitive order, sending a large number of airplanes to Xi'an to demonstrate. Soong Mei-ling then gathered the Huangpu military officers and air force personnel for a meeting, tearfully pleading with them not to listen to He Yingqin's orders. The two sometimes quarreled face-to-face. He Yingqin also became tough, scolding Soong Mei-ling, "What does a woman know about national affairs? I won't let you interfere!" Soong Mei-ling cried loudly and said, "You are doing too much to let Mr. Chiang down!" Soong Mei-ling then begged the Englishman Donald to fly to Xi'an and personally wrote a letter to Chiang Kai-shek. In the letter, she blamed Chiang Kai-shek for refusing his subordinates' demands to resist Japan and comforted him with various words. The last sentence of the letter was "Nanjing is a play within a play." When Chiang Kai-shek saw the sentence "a play within a play," he cried with a twisted face in front of Donald and General Zhang Xueliang.

  VII. Negotiations without showing his face or signing his name.

    After Donald returned, Soong Mei-ling's brother, Soong Tzu-wen, also flew to Xi'an. After the Red Army delegation and Generals Zhang and Yang agreed to adopt a policy of uniting with Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan and releasing Chiang Kai-shek, negotiations began based on Zhang and Yang's eight demands. At the beginning of the negotiations, Chiang Kai-shek put forward two principles: first, he would not come forward to talk but would let the Soong siblings represent him; second, he would guarantee the agreed conditions with the "leader's personality" and would not make any written signatures.

  VIII. Fearing the crowd's difficulties, he reiterated four promises at the airport.

    On December 25th, Zhang and Yang secretly sent Chiang Kai-shek to the airport because at that time many people did not want us to let him go like that. As soon as the car entered the airport, they saw one or two thousand students and the masses lined up waiting there. Chiang Kai-shek saw this, fearing that the crowd would not let him go. He hurriedly said to General Yang Hucheng, "I promise you the conditions, and I guarantee their implementation with the leader's personality. If they cannot be implemented in the future, you can deny that I am your leader. I promise you the conditions, I'll say it again. (Promise telegraphic code omitted)."

    This reiteration of the four promises, guaranteed with the leader's personality, was published in the Liberation Daily published in Xi'an on December 26th.

  IX. Where did the lecture to Zhang and Yang come from?

    After Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Nanjing, he quickly published a long and stinky lecture to Zhang and Yang. The content of that lecture said that Chiang Kai-shek had moved Zhang and Yang with his great and noble personality and they sent him back, and that Chiang had dictated it and Soong Mei-ling had taken notes. In fact, there was no such thing at all. It was entirely fabricated by Chen Bulei to deceive the people of the country. I remember that later Chen Guofu of the Ministry of Education even issued a notice to the whole country to make that long and stinky Jiang Bagu a compulsory course in Chinese for middle school students, and every student had to memorize it thoroughly. I really admire Chiang Kai-shek's thick skin!

  X. "My prestige is swept away, and what I say is no longer effective!"

    Later, after General Zhang Xueliang accompanied Chiang to Nanjing, he was detained and a military trial was organized. The conditions that Chiang Kai-shek had promised were never mentioned after Chiang returned. General Yang Hucheng sent Li Zhigang, a representative who was close to Chiang, to Hangzhou to see Chiang Kai-shek, wanting to bring up the promises Chiang Kai-shek had made. Representative Li politely expressed his intentions. Chiang Kai-shek got up from the bed, his face darkened, and said, "The Xi'an Incident swept away my prestige. Now in Nanjing, what I say is no longer effective!" How vividly this majestic tone is!

    回忆“双十二”
    申伯纯
    编者按：作者申伯纯先生，在“双十二”时任杨虎城将军指挥的十七路军的政治处长，抗战后历任八路军总部秘书长，晋冀鲁豫边区临参会及参议会议长。
    我曾亲身参加“双十二”事变，兹就回忆所得拉杂的说一点关于当时蒋介石的真实情形。
  一、逼上梁山。
    “双十二”事变是怎样爆发的呢？很简单，是蒋介石逼出来的。自“九一八”以后，因为日本步步进逼，要灭亡全中国，而蒋介石对外节节后退，死不抵抗，对内却进行大规模的“剿共”内战，屠杀人民。全国人民实在不能忍受了，到了廿四、五年的时候，“停止内战一致抗日”的主张，已成为广大人民普遍的要求。这种主张又影响了当时的军队，张杨两将军接受了这种主张，在十五年春先后与陕北红军进行停战，密订互不侵犯抗日友好协定。同时在东北军及十七路军部队中深入的进行抗日教育。到该年夏季，广东事变爆发，蒋介石当时调集全国的军队去打广东，在西北胡宗南的部队也调走了，那时张杨两将军曾企图与红军共同组织西北抗日联军，东出抗日，不料广东事变被蒋介石用分化瓦解的办法很快就给搞垮了。广东事变结束，蒋介石认为西北酝酿抗日，形势严重，于是亲率二三十万大军杀奔陕西来。蒋介石把军队停在平汉线和陇海线上，自己先到了西安，宣布不准抗日与继续彻底“剿共”计划，并压迫张杨，向张杨提出两个办法：一、服从“剿共”命令，将东北军及十七路军全部开向陕北前线，向陕北红军进剿，中央大军在后面接应督战。二、如张杨不愿打内战，则将东北军调到福建，十七路军调到安徽，将陕甘两省让给中央军自己“剿共”。这两个办法都为张杨所绝对不能接受的。照第一个办法，不但张杨不愿打，就是下边的军队也不愿打，因为同红军长期友好的接触及内部的抗日教育已经使东北军及十七路军不能打内战了；照第二个办法，张杨深知离开西北，离开红军，张杨两部也离开，那是自投陷阱，自取灭亡，必做十九路军和方振武第二。但是蒋介石给张杨的只有两个办法，毫无其他通融的余地。这时中央大军压境，纷纷开入陕西，蒋介石住在华清池气势汹汹，逼着张杨作最后决定，逼到最后，逼上了梁山，活捉了蒋介石，爆发了“双十二”事变。
  二、“你现在用手枪打死我，我的剿共政策也不能变！”
    在十二月七日那天，张杨两将军在前述情形下被蒋介石逼得没有办法，最后张学良将军有了一个“哭谏”的办法，想把“停止内战一致抗日”的道理破釜沉舟的向蒋介石“哭谏”一番，想用此办法感动他，说服他。那天下午张亲自到了华清池见蒋，于屏失了左右，痛切的陈述共产党现在的政策是民族抗日第一，红军的问题可用政治方法解决；并力陈部队抗日情绪高涨，不可压抑等等。蒋介石听了勃然大怒，骂张是年青无知，受了共产党的迷惑。张再三“苦谏”，继之以痛哭流涕的“哭谏”，两人激烈的争辩达三小时之久，最后蒋介石把桌子一拍，大声的说：“你现在就是拿手枪把我打死了，我的剿共政策也不能变！”张听了这话，知道这最后一着也无济于事，当晚回到西安，见了杨第一句就说：“失败了”。于是他两人才密谋把蒋先扣起来再要求停止内战，一致抗日。八日，西安学生列队向华清池进发，去向蒋请愿。蒋知道了这个消息，立刻亲自打电话给张学良，要他制止，不准学生到华清池来，如果学生不服制止，要派军队镇压，并连说要“格杀勿论”。张学良将军接电话后，亲自驾汽车追赶学生，追到沟桥，张劝学生回去，学生不肯，张愤慨的说，“你们回去吧！三天之内我有事实叫你们看！”学生于是才整队而归。
  三、跌倒在山凹凹里边。
    十二月十二日晨五时，华清池门前枪声大作，蒋介石随身带的几十名“御林军”慌忙起来抵抗，于是华清池院内演了一场激战。蒋介石从睡梦中惊醒，赶紧从床上爬起来，也不及穿衣穿鞋。就披着睡衣光着袜底从华清池后门逃跑。出了后门，在天色蒙胧中深一脚浅一脚的向凰山上奔命，跑了大概有将近半里路，一失足跌到有七八尺深壁立的一个山凹凹里边去了。脊骨跌坏了，脸也擦破了，山凹凹里长的有荒草，蒋介石就乘势向草里一钻，像野鸡一样，顾脑袋不顾屁股的钻到草里边。捉蒋介石的东北军在华清池遍寻他不着，有一位营长很细心跑到蒋介石的住屋中，摸摸蒋盖的被子还有温暖，桌上还放着蒋介石的假牙，知道蒋介石不会跑远，于是到小山上搜来搜去，一下看见山凹凹里的荒草当中钻着一个人，于是大喊一声：“什么人出来！”蒋介石这时没有办法，才战战兢兢的从草中钻出，连问“你们是什么军队，你们是什么军队”？及至知道是东北军，他却又装模作样坐下，抵死不肯自己上来，东北军的官兵看是蒋介石，就下去把他拖上来，架到汽车上，押送到西安新城大楼。
  四、虽然穿上副官的衣服，但副官仍不肯交出名单。
    上午八时，蒋介石被押送到了新城大楼，蒋介石这时还是披着睡衣，光着袜底，虽然一路之上有白凤祥团长的好心，把他的皮大衣脱给蒋介石披上。当晚守卫新城大楼的是绥署宪兵营，伺候蒋介石的是杨虎城将军的几个亲信副官。副官们第一件事就是找了一全套新的衣服、鞋袜送给蒋介石穿。副官们说：“这是杨主任给委员长送的，请委员长更衣吧！”蒋介石一听连说“我不穿，我不穿杨主任送我的衣服”。副官们没办法，同时也猜透蒋介石的心理，于是将衣服拿出去，马上又拿回来向蒋介石说：“这是我们几个人出钱给委员长买的，请穿上吧！”蒋介石听了马上就说：“啊！你们给我买的，我穿我穿！”穿上衣裳以后，蒋介石就装作很和气的口气对几位副官说：“我们现在是共患难的朋友，你们叫什么名字，给我一个名单来，我带在身上，将来是不忘你们对我的好处。”蒋介石这一套是想收买这几位副官，但是这几位副官却始终没有交给他名单。
        五、误会了搬家的好意，蒙着被子打哆嗦。
    大概是住了二三天以后，张、杨两将军认为蒋介石在新城大楼住着有些不方便，特意把副司令公馆对门的高桂滋公馆打扫好，作为蒋介石的住处。那天夜晚十一点钟，张学良将军派他的卫队营长孙铭九去接蒋介石，孙营长胸前皮带上插着一支左轮手枪，进了新城大楼，见了蒋介石说：“报告委员长！这里住着不方便，副司令给委员长预备一个好地方，请委员长马上同我搬去！”蒋介石一看孙铭九胸前插着的手枪，天又晚了，并且叫他马上同他一起走，他误会是要枪毙他，他颜色变了，浑身发抖，嘴里的假牙上下打的格格响，他于是迤里歪斜的连走几步，一歪身倒在床上，用被子把头一蒙，就说：“这是公家的地方，我不到旁的地方去，让我死在这里吧！”孙营长再三向他解释，他总是蒙在被子里打哆嗦。
  六、看了“戏中有戏”裂着嘴哭了。
    西安事变爆发后，在南京国民党内部的主张为两派：一派以何应钦为首，主张不管蒋介石死活，明令讨伐张、杨，用飞机先把西安炸平。这是因为何想趁此机会把蒋介石搞死，自己取而代之。另一派是以宋美龄为首，主张先不要颁发讨伐令，也不要用飞机轰炸西安，设法派人先到西安看一看具体情况，设法营救蒋介石。这两种主张斗争的非常激烈，何应钦不听宋美龄的主张，立即颁布讨伐令，并派大队飞机到西安上空示威，而宋美龄则召集黄埔军官和空军人员开会，一把鼻涕一把泪的让他们不要听何应钦的命令。两人有时当面争吵，何应钦也硬起来了，骂宋美龄说：“你妇人家懂得什么国家的事，不许你管！”宋美龄大哭着说：“你这样做太辜负蒋先生了！”宋美龄于是央请英国人端纳乘飞机到了西安，并亲笔给蒋介石写了一封信，信中一面责备蒋介石不该拒绝部下抗日的要求，一面就用种种的话安慰他。信的最后有一句是“南京是戏中有戏”。蒋介石看到了“戏中有戏”一句，就当着端纳和张学良将军裂着嘴哭了。
        七、不出头不签字的谈判。
    端纳回去以后，宋美龄的弟宋子文接着亦飞到西安。经红军代表团与张、杨两将军商定，采取与蒋介石团结抗日及释放蒋介石的方针后，于是就以张、杨的八项主张为根据而开始谈判。在谈判开始的时候，蒋介石提出了两个原则，一是他不出头谈而由宋氏姐弟代表他谈；二是商定的条件他以“领袖的人格”作保证，不作任何书面签字。
        八、恐怕群众留难，他在飞机场重申四项诺言。
    十二月二十五日，张、杨两人秘密送蒋介石到飞机场，因为那时有许多人不愿我们那样放他走。汽车刚一进飞机场，就看见有一二千学生和群众在那里列队等候，蒋介石一看，恐群众不让他走，他急忙对杨虎城将军说：“我答应你们的条件，我以领袖的人格保证实现，假若以后不能实现，你们可以不承认我是你们的领袖。我答应你们的条件，我再说一遍。（诺言电码脱漏）
    这个重申以领袖人格保证实现的四项诺言，曾刊于十二月二十六日在西安出版的解放日报上。
        九、那里来的对张杨训话？
    蒋介石到南京后，很快的就发表一篇又臭又长的对张杨训话，那个训话的内容是说蒋介石以他伟大崇高人格的意见感动得张杨把他送回去，并且说是临走时蒋口说宋美龄笔记的。其实根本没有那么一回事，完全是陈布雷杜撰以欺骗国人的一篇鬼话。记得以后教育部的陈果夫还通令全国把那篇又长又臭的蒋八股作为中学学生的国文必修课，每个学生都必须把它背诵得烂熟。我真佩服蒋介石的脸皮真厚！
        十、“我的威信扫地了，我说的话不能发生效力！”
    后来张学良将军陪蒋到南京后，被扣起来，还组织军法会审。蒋介石所答应的条件自从蒋回来后就一字不提了。杨虎城将军曾派亲蒋的代表李志刚到杭州去看蒋介石，想提一提蒋介石所作的诺言。李代表委婉的说出来意，蒋介石从床上起来，把脸一沉说：“西安事变你们使我威信扫地了，现在南京我说的话都不能发生效力”！这威严的口吻多么活现！
