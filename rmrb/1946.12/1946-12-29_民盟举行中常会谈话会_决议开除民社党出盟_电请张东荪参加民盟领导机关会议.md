　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th -- Shanghai dispatch: The China Democratic League's Standing Committee Meeting has resolved to expel the Social Democratic Party from the League for undermining the Political Consultative Conference, violating the League's charter, and participating in the one-party splinter "National Assembly." The letter demanding the party's withdrawal from the League was sent out on the 24th. After receiving the notice, the Social Democratic Party issued a statement the following day announcing its withdrawal. Since the Social Democratic Party, under the leadership of Zhang Junmai, participated in the "National Assembly," public opinion in Nanjing and Shanghai believes that the party has become politically bankrupt and is unworthy of the democratic community. One newspaper said: Zhang Junmai's "Mao" (劢) sounds the same as "Mai" (卖), meaning "sell." One evening newspaper claimed: Zhang Junmai and his group have completely "fallen into the water" from head to toe. While the Social Democratic Party withdrew from the League, the China Democratic League noted that Zhang Dongsun, a true democrat within the Social Democratic Party, adhered to the Political Consultative Conference's position, firmly refused to participate in the "National Assembly," and won social praise for his noble character. He has been telegraphed to Shanghai to attend the meeting of the League's leadership organs. Mr. Zhang Dongsun received the telegram and took off from Beiping on the 25th.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th -- According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Shanghai: After holding a Standing Committee Meeting from the 22nd to the 24th, the China Democratic League held the first preparatory meeting for the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic League at 2:00 PM on the 25th, chaired by Shen Junru. The meeting discussed how to expand and strengthen the organization of the China Democratic League and elected Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhou Xinmin to be responsible for researching specific plans. Mr. Zhang Dongsun flew from Ping to Shanghai at noon on the 25th to attend the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic League. Due to bad weather, he diverted and landed in Qingdao and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.

　　民盟举行中常会谈话会
    决议开除民社党出盟
    电请张东荪参加民盟领导机关会议
    【新华社延安二十六日电】沪讯：民盟中常会谈话会已决议开除破坏政协违反盟约参加一党分裂“国大”之民社党出盟。要求该党退盟之函件，已于二十四日送出。民社党于接到通知后，即于翌日发表声明退盟。盖自民社党在张君劢主持之下参加“国大”后，京沪舆论界认为该党在政治上业已破产，不齿于民主社会之林。某报谓：张君劢的“劢”字与“卖”字同音。某晚报称：张君劢及其一群已从头到脚全部“落水”。民盟中常会于民社党退盟同时，以民社党中的真正民主人士张东荪坚持政协立场，力拒参加“国大”，高风亮节，获得社会舆论嘉许，已电请其到沪参加民盟领导机关会议。张东荪氏接电，已于二十五日自北平起飞。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据中央社沪电：民盟在二十二日至二十四日举行中常会谈话会之后，于二十五日午后二时举行民盟二中全会第一次预备会，由沈钧儒主席，讨论如何扩大与加强民盟组织问题，并推选黄炎培、沈钧儒、章伯钧、罗隆基、周新民五人负责研究具体计划。张东荪氏已于二十五日午由平飞沪，赶来出席民盟二中全会。因气候恶劣，中途改在青岛降落，预定本日可抵沪。
