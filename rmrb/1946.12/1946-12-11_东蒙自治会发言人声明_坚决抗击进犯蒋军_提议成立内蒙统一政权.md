Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 6th. A spokesperson for the East Mongolia Branch of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Association stated: Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding the repeated protests of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement United Association, continues to attack Inner Mongolia, declaring the elimination of the autonomous governments in Wangyemiao, Hailar, Tongliao, Chifeng, Lindong and other places, falsely accusing the Inner Mongolian national autonomy demands of "sabotaging unification" and falsely accusing the people's government of being a "puppet organization." If Chiang Kai-shek dares to attack East Mongolia, the people of Inner Mongolia will rise up in self-defense. He continued: Chiang Kai-shek's unauthorized convocation of the "National Assembly," with no truly Mongolian representatives, is a conspiracy to "legalize" the attack on Inner Mongolia with Han chauvinism. Therefore, he proposes convening an Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference to establish a unified Inner Mongolia government to liberate the Inner Mongolian people.

    东蒙自治会发言人声明
    坚决抗击进犯蒋军
    提议成立内蒙统一政权
    【新华社齐齐哈尔六日电】内蒙自治运动协会东蒙总分会发言人声明称：蒋介石不顾内蒙自治运动联合会的屡次抗议，继续进攻内蒙，声言消灭王爷庙、海拉尔、通辽、赤峰、林东各地自治政权，将内蒙民族自治要求诬为“破坏统一”，诬人民政权为“伪组织”。蒋介石如胆敢进攻东蒙，内蒙人民将起而自卫。他继称：蒋介石擅自召开无一真正蒙民代表之“国大”，是阴谋将进攻内蒙与大汉族主义“合法化”，因此他提议召开内蒙人民代表会议，成立内蒙统一政权，来解救内蒙民族。
