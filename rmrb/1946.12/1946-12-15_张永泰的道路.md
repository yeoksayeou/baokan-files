Zhang Yongtai's Path
*Liberation Daily*

In northern Shaanxi, there was a man named Zhang Yongtai. He used to be a large landlord with 3,000 mu of land. After the land reform, his land was distributed, and he kept 50 mu for himself. At the time, he hated the Communist Party. Later, he gradually saw that the Communist Party and the democratic government were doing good things, promoting production, and running hospitals, always thinking of the people. He was deeply moved and then said, "I didn't know before that everyone should have food to eat, but now I see it clearly." What did he see clearly? He saw that it was most shameful for a person to gain without labor, that it was a crime to exploit and oppress people by relying on money and power, and that it was only right and natural for land to belong to the laboring peasants. Therefore, when someone asked him if he would want the land returned to him if others still offered it, he firmly shook his head and replied that he would not. He said, "I work for myself now and don't lack food or clothing. I don't want to be a wealthy man charging high interest and being cursed by the poor. Now everyone has land, everyone labors, and everyone lives a good life. Why not?" He now farms more than 30 mu of land himself, has orchards and vegetable gardens. This year's income is 8 million Border Region currency. After deducting the family's expenses, he can still save 2 to 3 million. He also runs a small shop in Yan'an City. This year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, he met Chairman Mao and said, "Now I feel that it is most dignified and happiest to live by my own labor." Chairman Mao told him, "Now you and Wu Manyou are living a good life, but the paths you two have taken are different. You went from not working to working."

Zhang Yongtai went from not working to working, from a feudal exploiter cursed by others to a most dignified and happy person who is well-fed and clothed by his own labor. This is a typical example of the thousands of people in the liberated areas who have transformed from former landlords and is the glorious path that landlords should take.

The purpose of the land reform implemented by the democratic government in the liberated areas is to liberate the peasants from feudal land relations, enable them to freely develop productive forces, improve agriculture, and thereby raise the level of industry and universally improve the lives of all the people. It aims to resolutely eliminate feudal oppression and feudal exploitation in order to remove the major obstacles on the road to our agricultural and industrial development, but it does not seek to eliminate individual landlords. Therefore, in addition to confirming that "the tiller owns his land" is an inalienable basic right of the people and using the law to guarantee that all peasants who cultivate the land with their own labor obtain a certain amount of land, the government of the liberated areas also guarantees that all landlords can retain enough land to maintain their lives, that is, equivalent to or slightly more than that of a middle peasant. The democratic government must also allow landlords who served in the anti-Japanese army and the anti-Japanese democratic government during the War of Resistance and actively assisted the anti-Japanese democratic government to retain one to two times more land than middle peasants. For the excess land of landlords, in addition to the peasants obtaining land ownership by clearing up debts in accordance with the laws of the democratic government or the landlords voluntarily donating it, some areas (such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region) have begun to have the government issue land bonds to purchase it at the market price and then redistribute it to landless or land-poor peasants.

The government guarantees that the industrial and commercial enterprises of landlords other than land shall not be violated in any way and will also help landlords to develop industry and commerce. The land retained by landlords, like the land distributed to peasants, is protected by government laws, and no one may infringe upon it. Landlords have the right to cultivate, freely rent out, or sell the land they retain. Landlords in the liberated areas, like everyone else, enjoy civil rights except for those who have been deprived of their civil rights by a court decision for committing crimes. The government guarantees their freedom of person, residence, speech, assembly, movement, and belief. Landlords who implement and actively support land reform in accordance with the law are also rewarded by the government. In this way, all landlords in the liberated areas can participate in production, engage in industry and commerce, achieve economic prosperity and cooperation with peasants in politics, and become active participants in the new democratic construction, following Zhang Yongtai's path. There are already many such people in the liberated areas today. Dadian Town in Juxian County, Shandong Province, is the location of the famous Zhuang family of landlords. After the land reform, 57 landlord families in the town participated in production, engaged in commerce, and industries such as spinning, weaving, and cigarette rolling. For example, Mr. Zhuang Hualou's family participated in spinning, weaving, and making cigarettes, earning more than 400,000 yuan in half a year. He happily said, "My whole family is self-sufficient in production, and life is very comfortable. I can still drink two liang of wine with every meal." They actively support various constructions of the democratic government.

The world is progressing, and China is also progressing day by day. The direction of this progress is firmly established. Feudal oppression and exploitation have no place in the new China. The democratic government in the liberated areas destroyed the feudal exploitation system but adopted a benevolent approach to each individual landlord, helping them to get rid of that parasitic, shameful, and inevitably declining social foundation, turn to labor, turn to production, and obtain true vitality from labor and production as a member of the new democratic society, living a prosperous, glorious, and happy life together with all sectors of society. Landlords in the liberated areas after the land reform can live and work in peace today, and the peasants are also united and cooperate with them. Chen Qingfang and Cheng Fengzu, landlords in Lianshui, actively participated in production after the land reform. Cui Dianyang, their former tenant, helped them cultivate the land and taught them how to plow. Chen Shu, the mutual aid team leader, cultivated five mu of land for them in their place. This is the new relationship between people in the liberated areas. It is not a master-slave relationship, not a relationship between feudal oppressors and the oppressed, but an equal and mutually supportive brotherly relationship. Through the land reform, the liberated areas have become a vibrant and more united society.

The transformation of landlords in the liberated areas and their current situation stand in stark contrast to the landlords in the KMT-controlled areas. Chiang Kai-shek represents the four feudal bureaucrat-comprador monopoly families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen to rule and exploit all Chinese people. He not only oppresses workers, peasants, and the petty bourgeoisie but also oppresses capitalists and landlords. He desperately conscripts grain, recruits soldiers, and seizes laborers. Landlords cannot escape his clutches either. Some landlords were arrested for failing to pay military grain, some were killed for fleeing conscription, and some had to post their field tax on the door and flee because they could not afford the land tax and conscription. Most pitifully, some landlords in the newly liberated areas were deceived into joining the "Homecoming Corps" or other activities against the liberated areas. As a result, their fields and houses were robbed and confiscated by their secret agents. Some of their wives and daughters were still raped, and sometimes they even lost their lives. In short, under the rule of this "General Disaster Chiang," the people all suffer without exception. The Chiang family reactionaries insist on saying that the Communist Party kills, sets fires, and eliminates landlords, but they are not talking about others. They are precisely talking about Chiang Kai-shek himself. Recently, landlords on the border of the liberated areas put forward the slogan "Support the Eighth Route Army's liquidation and do not let the Central Army stay." In areas temporarily occupied by the KMT army, many landlords resisted the "counter-liquidation movement" forcibly implemented by the KMT army, implementing a policy of ostensibly retreating but actually not retreating. Many landlords also helped the militia buy guns, repair blockhouses, and dig fortifications to jointly resist the attacking KMT army. All of this shows that Chiang Kai-shek's rule is extremely autocratic and extremely isolated, while the democratic government of the liberated areas is a symbol of national democratic unity. Today, the military and civilians in the liberated areas are carrying out a victorious war of self-defense and implementing land reform. They will do their best to take care of and protect the interests of all sectors of society and consolidate the unity of all sectors of society in order to resist Chiang Kai-shek's plague and quickly crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive.

    张永泰的道路
    解放日报
    陕北有个张永泰，他从前是大地主，有地三千亩，实行土地改革后，他的地被分配了，自己留下了五十亩，当时他恨死了共产党，后来他逐渐看到共产党和民主政府办事好，搞生产，办医院，处处为老百姓着想，他深深地感动了，随后便说：“我先前不知道要大家有饭吃，以后我可看清了”。他看清了些什么呢？他看见了做一个人不劳而获是最可耻的，仗着有钱有势来剥削人、压迫人是犯罪的，土地归给劳动农民是天公地道的。因此，有人问他如果别人仍把土地归还给他，他愿不愿意？他坚决摇着头回答不愿意，他说：“我现在自己劳动，不缺吃穿，再要让我当一个富豪放高利被穷人咒骂，我不愿意。现在人人有土地，人人劳动，大家都过好光景，为啥不好”。他现在自己种地三十多亩，有果园，有菜地，今年收入边币八百万元，除开全家吃用还可剩余二三百万元。他在延安市上还开一个小铺子。今年八月中秋，他曾见毛主席时说：“我现在觉得靠自己劳动过活是最体面最快乐的”。毛主席告他道：“现在你和吴满有一样过着好光景，不过你们两人经过的道路不同，你是从不劳动到劳动”。
    张永泰从不劳动到劳动，从一个被人咒骂的封建剥削者变为一个最体面最快乐的靠自己劳动丰衣足食的人，这是今天解放区成千从旧日地主转变过来的人的典型，也是地主们应走的光荣道路。
    解放区民主政府实行土地改革的目的，在于使农民从封建的土地关系中解放出来，使他们能够自由地发展生产力提高农业，从而提高工业的水平，普遍改善全体人民的生活。它要坚决地取消封建压迫与封建剥削，以便去掉我们农业和工业发展道路上的大障碍，但决不是要求消灭地主个人。因此解放区政府除了确认“耕者有其田”是人民不可剥夺的基本权利，要用法律来保障一切用自己劳力耕种土地的农民获得一定数量的土地以外，同时还保证一切地主得以保留足够维持其生活的一份土地，即当于中农或稍多于中农的土地。民主政府对于那些在抗战期间曾在抗日军队和抗日民主政府中服务，及积极协助抗日民主政府的地主，还须给他们保留超过中农一倍到两倍的土地。对于地主的超额土地，除农民根据民主政府法令清算积欠取得地权或者由地主自动捐献外，有些区（如陕甘宁边区），已着手由政府执行土地公债照价征购再分配给无地或少地的农民。
    地主除土地以外的工商业企业，政府保证一律不得侵犯，并且还要帮助地主转而发展工商业。地主所保留的土地和农民分得的土地一样，其地权受政府法律的保障，任何人不得侵犯。地主有自耕、自由出租或出卖其所保留土地之权，地主在解放区和一切人一样，除因犯罪被法庭依法判决剥夺公民权的以外，都享有公民权、政府保障其人身、居住、言论、集会、行动、信仰之自由。凡依法实行并积极赞助土地改革的地主，还受到政府的奖励。这样解放区一切地主都能照着张永泰的道路参加生产，经营工商业，在经济上走上丰衣足食，政治上与农民合作，作为新民主主义建设的积极参加者。这样的人，在今天解放区已经是不少了。山东莒县的大店镇是著名大地主庄姓家族的所在地，经土地改革后，该镇有五十七家地主参加生产，经营商业和纺线织布卷烟等业。如庄画楼先生全家参加纺线织布并制卷烟，半年获利四十余万元，他高兴地说：“我全家生产自给，生活很舒服，每顿饭还可喝二两酒”。他们积极支持着民主政府的各种建设。
    世界是在进步中，中国也日在进步中，这个进步的方向是确定不移的了。封建的压迫和剥削，在新的中国是一定没有地位的了。解放区民主政府对于封建剥削制度加以摧毁，而对于每个地主个人则采取了与人为善的方针，帮助他们摆脱那种寄生的可耻的必然要没落的社会根基，转向劳动、转向生产，并从劳动和生产中取得真正的生命力，作为新民主主义社会的一员，与各阶层一齐过丰衣足食光荣快乐的生活。经过土地改革以后的解放区地主，今天都能安居乐业了，农民也和他们团结合作了。涟水的地主陈清舫和程凤祖在土地改革后积极参加生产，他们以前的佃户崔殿扬帮助他们耕田，教他们掌犁，互助小组长陈书替他们代耕了五亩地，这是解放区人与人间的新关系，不是主奴关系，不是封建压迫者和被压迫者的关系，而是平等互助的兄弟关系。经过土地改革，解放区就这样成为一个生气蓬勃更加团结的社会了。
    解放区地主的转变和他们今天的处境，和蒋管区的地主恰恰成为显明的对照。蒋介石代表了蒋、宋、孔、陈四个封建买办垄断大家族来统治和压榨一切中国人，他不仅压迫工人农民和中小资产阶级，而且压迫资本家和地主，他拚命征粮征兵抓丁，地主也逃不出他的虎口。地主们有的因缴不出军粮而被捕，有的因逃丁而被杀，有的因负担不起田赋征兵把田税贴在门上而逃亡，最可怜的有些新解放区的地主一时受骗参加了“还乡队”或其他反对解放区的活动，结果他的田地房屋反被其特务抢劫没收个精光，有的妻女仍被奸淫，有时连命也不保。总之在这个“蒋总灾”的统治下面，人民一概受难，无可幸免。蒋家反动派硬要说共产党杀人放火消灭地主，这不是说的别人，恰巧是说的蒋介石自己。最近解放区边境地主提出“拥护八路军清算，不让中央军住下”的口号，在暂被蒋军侵占地区，很多地主抵抗蒋军强迫实行的“倒清算运动”，实行明退暗不退；还有很多地主帮助民兵买枪修炮楼挖工事，共同抗击进攻的蒋军。所有这一切，都说明了蒋介石的统治是极端专制与极端孤立的，而解放区民主政府则是全民民主团结的象征。今天解放区军民在进行胜利的自卫战争与贯彻土地改革，他们将尽力照顾与保护各阶层的利益，巩固各阶层的团结，以抵制蒋介石的瘟疫，迅速粉碎蒋介石的进攻。
