　　【Report from Our Newspaper in Weixian, 24th】 Southern Hebei is a nationally renowned cotton producing area and textile region. During the Kuomintang rule, large landlords monopolized cotton fields, and imported goods overwhelmed national industries, causing the rural economy to become increasingly bankrupt. After the Incident, Japanese imperialism frantically plundered cotton and destroyed textile tools, causing the textile industry to suffer severe damage. Since the War of Resistance, our democratic government has vigorously supported the rural textile industry. During the disaster relief production in 1943, the government provided large loans to buy tools, promoted textile production, and guaranteed a minimum profit of one jin of rice per person per day. The Fourth District alone organized 22,652 women and loaned a total of 600,000 jin of grain at one time. On the other hand, it prohibited the entry of Japanese goods and encouraged tax-free exports of textiles. The domestic cloth market expanded to major cities such as Tianjin, Jinan, and Beiping.

    The most developed counties in the southern Hebei textile industry are Weixian, Nangong, Quxian, Guangping, Pingxiang, Guantao, Guanxian, Jize, Yongnian, Qiuxian, Linqing, and Yuanchao. The total annual output of domestic cloth in the region can reach 30 million bolts. The towel weaving industry is now booming. Initially, only Yuan Jinlan, who sold groceries in Guandi Village, the Eighth District of Weixian, knew this craft. In 1931 of the Republic of China, there were only about a dozen families involved. Now, an average of 3,000 dozen towels are available on the market in Shaogu at one fair (reaching up to 10,000 dozen at peak times), generating an income of 4.5 million yuan. The best quality towels are produced by Shaogu's "Moonlight" and "Brother" brands. To greatly develop the textile industry, the government has established a textile industrial cooperative in Linqing City, specializing in researching textile machinery. In addition to meeting local needs, southern Hebei textiles are currently sold in liberated areas such as Taihang, central Hebei, northern Jiangsu, and Hebei-Shanxi-Henan. There are domestic cloth markets in Jinan, Tianjin, and Beiping, and they can even reach areas such as Zhangjiakou in Inner Mongolia. As for textile profits, they are more than six times higher than agricultural production. With the development of the textile industry, domestic cloth merchants also make substantial profits. In 1943, 15 chi of cloth could be exchanged for one dou of grain, while this year, 3 chi of cloth can be exchanged for one dou of grain; in 1943, one dozen towels was worth 180 yuan, which could earn 1.2 dou of grain, while this year, one dozen towels sells for 3,000 yuan, which can buy 8 dou of grain.

　　冀南纺织业大踏步前进
    全区年产布约三千余万匹
    行销各解放区及平津等地
    国民党统治时代横遭摧残
    民主政府扶植下逐步复兴
    【本报威县二十四日电】冀南是全国著名的产棉区和纺织区。国民党统治时代，大地主垄断棉田，舶来品压倒了民族工业，使农村经济日趋破产。事变后日帝国主义疯狂掠夺棉花，破坏纺织工具，致使纺织业受到严重摧残。抗战以来我民主政府对农村纺织业就大力扶植。在四三年生产救灾时，政府更以大力贷款买工具，提倡纺织，保证每人每天最低一斤米的利润，只四分区就组织了两万二千六百五十二名妇女，一次贷组织粮六十万斤。另一面则禁止日货侵入，奖励纺织品免税出口，土布市场扩展至天津、济南、北平等大都市。
    冀南纺织业最发达的是威县、南宫、曲周、广平、平乡、馆陶、冠县、鸡泽、永年、邱县、临清、元朝等县，全区全年可产土布三千万匹。毛巾纺织业，现在是风起云涌，初只威县八区官地村卖杂货的袁金兰会这一手艺，民国三十一年也只十来家，现在邵固一集平均就有三千打毛巾上市（多时可到万打），收入四百五十万元。织得最好的是邵固的月光牌、兄弟牌，政府为了大量发展纺织，特在临清市设立纺织实业社一处，专门研究纺织机器。冀南纺织品除自给外，现行销于太行、冀中、北海、冀晋豫等解放区。济南、天津、北平都有土布市场，并能达到蒙疆张家口一带。至于纺织利润，则超过农业生产六倍，随着纺织业的发展，土布贩获利也很大。四三年十五尺布能换一斗谷子，今年三尺布换一斗谷子；四三年一打毛巾值一百八十元，可赚一斗二升谷子，今年一打毛巾卖三千元，能买八斗谷子。
