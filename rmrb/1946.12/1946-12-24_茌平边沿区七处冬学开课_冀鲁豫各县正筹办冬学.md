　　[This Dispatch from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Correspondent on the 20th] Winter schools are being widely opened throughout the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region. Counties and districts are enthusiastically holding joint political and civilian meetings and symposiums of village cadres and educators to study how to develop winter schools and strengthen the political education of the masses. In the seven border districts of Chiping County alone, seven schools have opened. Organizationally, the winter schools in this district are managed by a winter school committee consisting of teachers, village chiefs, self-defense captains, and heads of farmers' associations. Each school has one political instructor and one cultural instructor. To resolve the conflict between attending winter school and standing guard or night watch, a system of alternate nights for schooling has been adopted. One class attends school tonight, and another class attends school tomorrow night, and the number of students is increasing daily.
