[This report from Changzhi on the 10th] JiaoZuo city recently convened a city-wide cadre meeting. It reviewed the guerrilla warfare of the past month, acknowledging brilliant achievements but also the existence of a tendency towards purely military activities. It put forward the slogan "Closely integrate political offensives and launch a propaganda war against the enemy." Each militia team, every time they went into action, was required to form a propaganda group of three to five people to go behind enemy lines to post our propaganda materials and proclamations, paint slogans, and conduct oral propaganda to the masses. There were also people specifically responsible for collecting enemy puppet documents, newspapers, and propaganda materials to expose the enemy's puppet deception, rumors, and intimidation. The political offensive has now been launched, and the masses who had been scared away by Chiang's special agents and local bullies have also returned home. As soon as the masses saw our militia and government workers, they said, "If we had known you were still here, we would never have left." The returned masses are in a stable mood and have gradually participated in our front-line guerrilla activities. Under the influence of our political offensive, anti-war sentiment among Chiang's puppets is burning fiercely. Soldiers of the 38th Division of Chiang's army stationed in JiaoZuo Li Feng have also surrendered to us one after another. From the night of the 7th of last month, when the army was deployed for defense, until the 1st of this month, ten soldiers had surrendered within eighteen days, bringing with them one machine gun, one grenade launcher, six Arisaka rifles, more than 700 rounds of American-made ammunition, seven hand grenades, three artillery shells, and six bayonets. They have now arrived at a certain place in our rear and have been warmly received by our government and the masses along the way. A surrendered soldier named Chen said to the masses at the welcome meeting: "Seeing the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, it's like seeing my own parents. Seeing the militia and the common people is like seeing my own brothers. Coming to the liberated area, taking off the traitor's hat, changing the traitor's clothes, changing the stubborn name, I am happy to be an Eighth Route Army soldier and fight the old Chiang to the end!"

　　克服单纯军事活动偏向
    焦作普遍开展政攻
    组织宣传小组深入敌后揭发蒋伪
    群众纷纷返家蒋军反战情绪日炽
    【本报长治十日电】焦作市近日召开全市干部会议，检讨月来游击战争，虽获辉煌战绩，但尚存在单纯军事活动的偏向，提出“密切结合政攻，向敌展开宣传战”口号。各队民兵每次出击必以三至五人组成宣传小组，到敌后张贴我宣传品、布告，涂写标语口号，向群众进行口头宣传。另有专人负责搜集敌伪文件书报宣传品等，针对敌伪欺骗、造谣、恐吓，给以揭发。现政攻已经展开，被蒋特恶霸造谣吓走之群众亦都返家。群众一见我民兵及政府工作人员就说：“要知道你们还在，俺可早就不走了。”返家群众情绪安定，已逐渐参加我前方游击活动。在我政攻影响下，蒋伪反战情绪炽燃。驻焦作李封之蒋军卅八师士兵，亦纷纷向我投诚。从上月七日夜该军按防时至本月一日十八天内投诚士兵已达十人，并带出机枪一挺，掷弹筒一个，三八式步枪六枝，美造子弹七百余发，手榴弹七个、炮弹三个、刺刀六把。现彼等已到达我后方某地，沿途备受我政府群众热情招待。一个姓陈的投诚士兵在欢迎会上曾向群众说：“一见到毛主席、朱总司令的像，就像见了我亲爹娘，见了民兵老百姓就像见了亲兄弟一样。来到解放区，脱了卖国帽，换了卖国衣，改了顽固名，高兴的当个八路军和老蒋拚到底！”
