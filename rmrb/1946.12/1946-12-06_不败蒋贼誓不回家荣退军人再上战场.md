　　【Report from People's Daily, Licheng】Retired veterans in Licheng, Taihang, are eagerly heading to the front lines to participate in the war under the slogan "Defend Yan'an, Defend Chairman Mao!" Cai Zhengqian, a well-known honored veteran and hero in killing enemies, had already sharpened his bayonet, ready to go to the front again and fight Chiang Kai-shek, upon hearing that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking Yan'an. On the 19th of last month, all the honored veterans in the Fifth District automatically gathered to mobilize for participation in the war. They challenged the retired veterans in various districts: to maintain the glorious tradition of honored veterans and to support the patriotic self-defense war to defend Yan'an with action. At the meeting, many comrades examined their ideas of complacency, enjoyment, and complacency since peace, and thought of the revolutionary fruits they had exchanged for blood and sacrifice, which were being robbed by the US-Chiang reactionaries! The fire of patriotism and revenge ignited in their hearts, and more than 50 people immediately signed up to participate in the war. Zhang Shou, a retired veteran from Canhou Village, formulated a ten-point work plan to lead the masses to participate in the war, proposing that those honored veterans who can participate in the war should do so, leaving the masses behind to produce; those who are disabled and cannot participate in the war should help the families of soldiers and militiamen participating in the war by chopping firewood, carrying water, eliminating traitors and opposing special agents, and consolidating the rear. The challenge issued by the Fifth District has been responded to by the retired veterans in the Sixth District, who proposed to lead the masses to participate in the war and protect the good times. Furthermore, the emancipated peasants of Chengjiashan in the Second District discussed the Central Bureau's call to defend Yan'an in winter school, which aroused the anger of the entire village against American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. Everyone said: We, all the peasants, must unite as one to defend Yan'an and defend Chairman Mao. The village is conducting a check-up and mobilizing for participation in the war, determined to cut off the feudal tails completely. Zhang Bensheng, an old man who was once a cowherd and had turned himself around, said: "Those who love the people are loved by all. In order to defend Chairman Mao, I, an old man, will fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end!" (Xin Wen, Yan Liang, Zong Dai, Lü Duan)
