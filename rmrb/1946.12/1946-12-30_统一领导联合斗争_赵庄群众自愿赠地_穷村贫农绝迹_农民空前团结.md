　　【Benbao Weixian Twenty-sixth Electric】Xin County Zhao Village successfully resolved the land problem of the poor village through joint struggle. This village is a large wealthy village. There are 190 households in the whole village, including 29 landlords and 12 rich peasants. The small poor villages nearby are directly exploited by the high interest rates of the landlords and rich peasants of Zhao Village. The landlords suppressed the nearby small villages with their "wealth and power". The landlords of Zhao Village grazed sheep in the fields of Xiaowanglou, causing the peasants to harvest more than 5,000 jin of grain less each year. Beatings and scolding were even more common. Therefore, the small villages had a very deep hatred for the landlords of Zhao Village and demanded to settle accounts with and struggle against the landlords of Zhao Village. Based on the above conditions, the peasants of Zhao Village were first allowed to struggle against a few households to solve the land problem. In the distribution of the fruits [of struggle], class education of "poor people all over the world are one family, unity is strength" was repeatedly carried out. Then more than ten surrounding small villages were allowed to take the initiative to find the masses of Zhao Village to discuss the issue of joint struggle. With the consent of the masses of Zhao Village, a leading organization for joint struggle was first established—the Grievance Committee. The small villages were allowed to listen to the opinions of the masses of Zhao Village as much as possible, with the active elements of Zhao Village as the main force, to discuss how to get through the masses' thinking, to prevent opinions among the masses from arising in the struggle. After the above-mentioned brewing, the masses of Zhao Village took the initiative to propose that the remaining land be given to the nearby small villages. Thus, the land problems of both large and small villages were solved. A total of 12 lawless landlords were struggled against, 570 mu of land and 4 million yuan were recovered, and the remaining houses and property were worth 4.9 million yuan. After the struggle, all 15 poor peasant households in Qiansunzhuang rose to become middle peasants, with each person averaging 3 mu of good land. Wang Village and Xiaowanglou, with nine households each, eliminated poor peasants throughout the village. After the victory of the struggle, the Zhao Village Neighborhood Farmers' Representative Association was immediately established with the Grievance Committee as the main body. The masses of Zhao Village and the surrounding villages were unprecedentedly united.

    穷村贫农绝迹
    农民空前团结
    【本报威县廿六日电】莘县赵庄以联合斗争顺利解决了贫村土地问题。该村是个大富村，全村一百九十户，有地主二十九户，富农十二户，附近小穷村直接受到赵庄地主富农高利盘剥，地主们以“财大气粗”压制附近小村。赵庄地主往小王楼地里放羊吃庄稼，致使农民每年少收五千余斤粮食，打骂更不说了。因此小村对赵庄地主仇恨非常深，要求与赵庄地主进行清算斗争。根据以上条件，先让赵庄农民斗了几户，解决了土地问题，并在分果实中，反复的进行了“天下穷人是一家、联合起来力量大”的阶级教育，然后让周围十余小村，主动找赵庄群众，共商联合斗争问题。在获得赵庄群众同意之下，首先建立了联合斗争的领导机构——诉苦委员会，让小村多听取赵庄群众意见，以赵庄积极分子为主，讨论怎样打通群众的思想，以防止在斗争中引起群众之间的意见。该村经过上述酝酿后，赵庄群众即自动提出，将剩余土地让与附近小村，于是大小村的土地问题，均得到解决了。共斗不法地主十二户，追出土地五顷七十亩，款四百万元，其余房宅资财共值洋四百九十万元。前孙庄十五户贫农，斗争后全部上升为中农，每人平均得好地三亩。九户人家的王村和小王楼，全村消灭了贫农。斗争胜利后，立即以诉苦委员会为主，建立了赵庄小区农民代表会，赵庄和周围村群众空前地团结起来了。
