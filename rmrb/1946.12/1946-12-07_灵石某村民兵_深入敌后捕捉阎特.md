　　Lingshi County Militia
　　Penetrates Enemy Lines to Capture Yan's Special Agent
　　[This Newspaper's Report] The militia from ×× Village in Lingshi County penetrated deep into Yan's puppet stronghold and captured Wu Daolong, the head of Yan Xishan's "Revenge Corps" and a major Chinese traitor. Wu was a traitor who served as a puppet village chief. When the mass movement was launched in February of this year, he fled into the city and became the head of Yan Xishan's "Revenge Corps," killing nineteen people. On the 29th of last month, Wu led his men to Xiyuan Village and captured our Farmers' Association secretary, which aroused great anger among the masses. They chased him for several villages but failed to catch him. That night, the armed village government and militia rotation team of ××× Village, with more than ten people, determined to fight to the death and penetrated deep into Yan's puppet stronghold of Yucheng Village. They ambushed in the fort in the center of the village and waited all night. Finally, on the morning of the next day, when Wu appeared, they captured him. Yan's puppets discovered this and chased and fired at them, but it was too late. After the militia brought Wu back to the village, the masses were very happy and said, "The militia are truly the saviors who protect the people!"
　　　　　　
　　Note: This village militia had already been active on both sides of the Fen River during our army's last recapture of Lingshi City, capturing more than forty Yan soldiers and seizing forty-two rifles and one pistol. Recently, the campaign to protect the home and love the country has achieved considerable results. Their main experiences are: (1) Penetrate deep into enemy strongholds, understand the enemy's situation in detail, discover the enemy's weaknesses and patterns of action, and strike whenever there is an opportunity. (2) The government and the militia are integrated. While one side carries out armed struggle, the other side expands the scope of our government's activities. (3) The organization is small, lean, and efficient, overcoming the weaknesses of the large rotation teams, enabling it to carry out armed activities covertly and making it difficult to expose. (4) Being able to combine with the interests of the people, doing whatever the masses ask, so it has great power.

　　灵石某村民兵
    深入敌后捕捉阎特
    【本报讯】灵石县××村民兵深入阎伪据点，活捉阎锡山的“复仇团”团长大汉奸吴道隆；吴逆曾投敌充当伪村长；今年二月群运掀起时逃往城内，当了阎锡山的“复仇团”团长，杀害十九个群众，上月二十九日，吴逆带人到西原村捕走我农会秘书，激起群众剧烈愤怒，追了好几个村没有追上。当晚×××村武装村公所与民兵轮战队十余人，抱定你死我活的决心，深入阎伪据点玉成村内，埋伏在当中的堡子里，整等了一夜，终于在第二天清晨吴逆出现时将其捕获。阎伪发觉后，追踪射击，但已无济于事。民兵带吴逆回村后，群众非常高兴，都说：“民兵真正是保护老百姓的恩人！”
　　　          
    按：该村民兵在我军上次收复灵石城时，即曾到汾河两岸活动，俘阎军四十余人，得步枪四十二支、手枪一支。最近的保家爱国运动，又已获得不少成绩。其主要经验是：（一）深入敌据点，细密了解敌人情况，发现敌之弱点与行动规律，一有机会就打。（二）政权与民兵结成一体，一方进行武装斗争，一方即推广我政权活动范围。（三）组织短小精干，克服了大轮战队的弱点，能够隐蔽进行武装活动，不易暴露。（四）能与人民利益结合，群众要求干什么，就干什么，所以它有很大的力量。
