　　Experience in Checking Emancipation in the First District of Licheng
    Ren Qing, Dong Sheng
    I. Self-criticism by cadres to strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses is the primary issue in carrying out emancipation checks in old liberated areas. In the old liberated areas, many village cadres have been somewhat alienated from the masses over the years. If cadres cannot recognize this point and make self-criticisms to the masses in order to enlighten them and strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses, it will be difficult to carry out the emancipation check well. For example, the cadres of Shang Guihua Village were almost all bought off by landlords, and factional struggles among the landlords led to disunity among the cadres, and work has always been backward. At the beginning of this movement, we first started by raising the cadres' class consciousness and removing the estrangement between the cadres and the masses. After reflecting and becoming aware, the cadres unanimously proposed: "Don't eat a bowl of rice from the landlord, don't smoke a bag of cigarettes from the landlord." Li Changming, the public security officer, was the first to hand over the property he had hidden for the landlord Li Kuifang, which influenced other cadres to report theirs one after another, and they all made self-criticisms at the mass meeting. The broad masses of people joined the cadres in launching a thorough liquidation against the landlords.
    II. Use the method of sharing grievances to mobilize backward peasants. In this emancipation check, several villages first had cadres share their grievances (because most of the cadres were poor), to inspire a high degree of awareness among the cadres, and then the cadres went to find the most oppressed peasants. After these peasants became aware, they were allowed to use the same method to mobilize more people. For particularly honest peasants (especially old men and women), more efforts were made to enlighten them. Liu Rensuo, a hired worker in Xiwu, was the most backward peasant. This time, the village cadres first mobilized the hired worker Zhang Shiqin, and then let Zhang Shiqin enlighten him.
    III. Strengthen the education that middle and poor peasants are one family and eliminate the "cutting韭菜" (chives) mentality. For example, after liquidating the landlords in Kengxi Village, some middle peasants became uneasy and said, "The rich people in our village have all been struggled against. If we continue to struggle, I'm afraid it will be our turn." The village cadres quickly convened a forum for middle and poor peasants, explaining that middle and poor peasants are one family and cannot struggle against each other. The masses proposed to cut off the feudal tails of eleven households, two of which were middle peasants. A solution was reached on the spot through mediation, thus eliminating the middle peasants' "cutting韭菜" mentality.
    IV. Raise the class consciousness of peasants and break the "benevolent rich" (landlord usurer) mentality. For example, when Xiwu Village began to deliberate, it was found that the peasants had the idea of "opposing only those who had directly exploited them." The landlord Wang Bingsheng had exploited the peasants with high rents, but on the surface, he was very good to people, so everyone said he was a "good rich man" and felt embarrassed to liquidate him. The cadres asked, "Is there such a thing as a good rich man?" and let everyone discuss it. The mother of Liu Rengui, a hired worker, said, "People often say: All crows are black, and which rich man doesn't rely on exploiting the poor?" After discussion, everyone's class consciousness was raised, and a liquidation was launched against Wang Bingsheng, the so-called "benevolent rich man."

　　黎城一区翻身检查经验
    任卿　东生
    一、干部进行自我检讨，密切干部与群众关系，是开展老区翻身检查的首要问题。老区许多村干部几年来与群众是有一些隔阂的，如不能使干部认识这一点，对群众作自我检讨，以启发群众觉悟，密切干部与群众关系，翻身检查就很难搞好。如上桂花村干部差不多都被地主收买，随着地主的派别斗争，而形成干部间的互不团结，工作一贯落后，这次运动开始，即先从提高干部阶级觉悟，解除干部与群众的隔阂做起。干部经过反省自觉，一致提出：“不吃地主一碗饭，不吸地主一袋烟”。公安员李长命首先把替地主李魁芳隐藏的财物提出：影响其他干部也纷纷报出，并一齐在群众会上作了反省，广大群众都随着干部齐心合力向地主展开了彻底清算。
    二、用苦连苦的办法，发动落后农民。这次翻身检查，好几个村是先在干部中诉苦（因干部多系穷人），启发干部的高度自觉，然后干部再分头去找最受压迫的农民，待这些农民觉悟起来，再让他们用同样的办法去发动更多的群众，对于特别老实的农民（尤其是老汉老婆）则更多的去启发。西仵雇工刘仁锁是最落后的农民，这次村干部先把雇工张石琴发动起来，又让张石琴启发了他。
    三、加强中贫农是一家的教育，解除“割韭菜”思想。如坑西村在清算地主后，一些中农即发生不安，并说：“咱村老财都斗啦，再斗恐怕就该咱了。”村干部很快的便召开了中贫农座谈会，说明中贫农是一家，自家不能斗自家。群众提出要割十一户封建尾巴，其中有两户是中农，当场即用调解的办法取得解决，这样中农的“割韭菜”思想便解除了。
    四、提高农民阶级觉悟，打破“善老财”（地主高利贷者）思想。如西仵村在开始酝酿时，发现农民有“受过谁直接剥削，只反对谁”的思想，地主王炳生曾高租剥削农民，但表面上很会待人，大家便说他是个“好老财”，不好意思清算他。干部提出：“是否有好老财”让大家讨论，雇工刘仁贵的母亲说：“人常说：天下老鸦一般黑，那个老财不是靠剥削穷人的”。经过讨论，大家的阶级觉悟提高了，对所谓“善老财”的王炳生也展开了清算。
