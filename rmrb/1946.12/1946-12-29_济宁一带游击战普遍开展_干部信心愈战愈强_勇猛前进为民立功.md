　　[Report from this newspaper in the冀鲁豫 (Ji-Lu-Yu) area, dated 25th] In the Jining, Jiaxiang, Nanwang, and other Chiang-occupied areas of the Seventh Sub-district, since our army has universally launched guerrilla warfare, it has achieved considerable success and gained some experience: (1) Due to the Chiang army's lack of manpower, we have consistently been victorious in the Chiang-occupied areas. The cadres' confidence increases with each battle, demonstrating that past overestimation of the Chiang-occupied areas was unfounded. As long as we advance boldly and courageously, we can hold our ground and launch guerrilla warfare. (2) Because the Chiang army recruits soldiers in large numbers wherever it goes and imposes unlimited extortion, the people's lives are miserable, which causes widespread discontent and resentment among the masses, even among ordinary landlords. As long as we unite all classes effectively, cherish the masses, protect their interests, and establish a united front of patriotism and democracy, and everyone unites to defend themselves, we can create base areas behind enemy lines. (3) Our armed activities are flexible; we fight when we can, and retreat when we cannot, always proactively striking the enemy. (4) Leadership plays a leading role, overcoming the tendency of troops and cadres to retreat during the transition from peace to war. Practical actions have improved morale and strengthened confidence. Regarding future guerrilla warfare, there are a few suggestions: (1) Vigorously launch a campaign to earn merits and serve the people. When the masses are suffering unprecedented disasters, we should courageously step forward and use guerrilla warfare activities to protect the people's interests. This is a time when the people urgently need us to save them from disaster, which also means we need to contribute even more to the people and earn merits. (2) We must further strengthen the concept of relying on the masses, pay attention to benefiting the people and eliminating their problems at all times, care about the masses' big and small troubles, go to every village to discuss and find ways to alleviate their suffering with the people, and strictly enforce discipline and correctly implement policies to win the people's hearts. (3) Constantly educate everyone to understand the nature of the war and improve the people's political awareness. (4) Cadres should pay special attention to caring for the soldiers, leading by example, caring for everyone's lives and political progress, explaining, encouraging, and educating more, so as to consolidate the soldiers' morale and unite the entire army, which is the guarantee of victory.

　　济宁一带游击战普遍开展
    干部信心愈战愈强
    勇猛前进为民立功
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】七分区济宁、嘉祥、南旺等蒋占区，在我军普遍开展游击战争以来，已获得不少成绩，并得到了一些经验：（一）由于蒋军兵力的不足，我们在蒋占区一直是胜利的，干部信心愈战愈高，说明过去对蒋占区过高估计，没有根据；只要我们大胆勇猛前进，是能够坚持阵地，展开游击战争的。（二）因为蒋军所到之地大量抓兵和无限制的敲诈勒索，人民生活痛苦不堪，于是引起广大群众的不满与愤恨，就是一般地主也是不满的，只要我们很好的团结各阶层，爱护群众，保护群众利益，建立爱国民主的统一战线，大家一致起来自卫，是能够在敌后创造根据地的。（三）我们武装活动灵活，能打即打，不能打即走，要随时主动的打击敌人。（四）领导上带头作用，克服部队与干部由和平到战争的转变中的退却倾向，由实际行动中提高了斗争情绪和加强信心。关于今后的游击战争有几点意见：（一）大力开展立功运动，为人民立功。当群众正受着从来没有的灾难，我们应当勇猛向前，以游击战争的活动，去保卫人民利益，这是人民空前需要我们挽救其灾难的时候，也即需要我们更加给人民出力立功的时候。（二）必须更进一步的加强依靠群众的观念，注意时时刻刻为老百姓兴利除弊，关心群众的大小痛苦，到每一村与老百姓商量讨论解除痛苦的办法，并且严格纪律，正确执行政策，以争取人心向我。（三）随时教育大家认识战争性质，提高群众政治认识。（四）干部特别注意爱护战士同志，以身作则，带领大家，关心大家生活及政治进步，多解释、鼓励、教育，使战士情绪巩固，全军团结，是胜利的保证。
