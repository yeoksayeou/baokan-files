(Delayed Telegram from Taiyue, December 23rd, This Newspaper) Xia County launched a vigorous psychological warfare campaign against the Chiang army on the 16th and 19th of last month. During the offensive, they went deep near Chiang's strongholds to write slogans, distribute propaganda, conduct loudspeaker appeals, lay mines, and take potshots, using various methods to get close to the masses, convene mass grievance meetings and forums, and practice stone mine explosions. According to reports from refugees fleeing from Chiang-controlled areas, the offensive's impact has led to a growing number of deserters from the Chiang side. It is known that four people from Fujiazhuang, two from Guo Po, three from Xijin, four from Cuijiahe, three from Shayuan, and some have also returned from Zhouchen Village. Some are secretly looking for connections to protect their future. Some told our personnel: "Don't worry, I won't leave unless I take ten guns with me." Some landlords who fled and were subject to struggle sessions and who engaged in counter-settlements have also changed their attitude. A certain target of struggle in Guodao Village carried grain on his back and returned fruits to the masses. Targets of struggle who fled to the city are planning to run back. Cui Yishou, a landlord in Xiyin Village, has already run back. Those who have not run away feel they have no way out, no way to make a living, and weep bitterly. Gu XX of ×× Village also asked someone to inform the masses, saying he wanted to come back. The practical effect of the propaganda on the masses is mainly reflected in exposing the enemy's deceptive smokescreen and shattering the masses' thoughts of peace. After our propaganda and explanation, the masses, based on their own experiences, recognized the Chiang reactionaries' peace offensive as a trick with just one point. The masses said: "The ceasefire order has been issued, and they say there is peace! But why are they still conscripting soldiers?" The masses in Guoli Village put it well: "Chiang Kai-shek's 'peace' is like shifting a load from one shoulder to another. It's still hard work and we must prepare for a major battle!" These propaganda contents, using specific local examples to expose the Chiang army's atrocities, aroused the masses to pour out their grievances, and they treated us as confidants. An old man in Miaozhuang said: "The first time they asked my village for three people, it cost 2.4 million to hire substitutes. The second time they asked for nine, causing a large number of young people to flee." Of the more than two hundred households in Xialiu Village, two hundred have fled. Those who are at home dare not sleep at home. Young people in Meiling carry hand grenades and hide in the fields all day long. Another old man said: "Each mu of land is assessed a fee of 5,000 yuan. If you don't have the money, they'll ransack your house!"

    夏县开展攻心战
    许多逃亡地主返回解放区
    【本报太岳二十三日电】（迟到）夏县于上月十六日、十九日先后对蒋军展开有力的攻心战，在攻势中，深入蒋据点附近写标语，散宣传品、进行喊话、埋雷、打冷枪，运用各种方法接近群众，召开群众诉苦会、座谈会，演习石雷爆炸。由蒋区逃来难民报告，攻势影响所及，蒋方逃亡人员日渐增多，据知者有傅家庄四人，埚坡二人，西晋三人，崔家河四人，沙源三人，周陈村也有回来的，也有暗下找关系防后路的，有的向我们人员说：“你放心，我不拿走十支枪不过去。”还有一些逃亡的斗争对象和进行倒算的地主，态度也转变了。郭道村某斗争对象，背上粮食向群众退果实。逃在城里的斗争对象，打算往回跑，西阴村地主崔一寿已跑回来。未跑出来者感到没路走，对生活没有办法，痛哭流涕。××村谷××也央人向群众通气，说要回来。对群众宣传的实际效果，主要表现在揭破敌顽欺骗烟幕，打破群众和平思想上面，经过我们的宣传解释，群众由其切身经验，只用一点，就识破了蒋顽和平攻势的骗局，群众说：“下停战令了，说和平哩！可是为什么还在抓兵抽丁？”郭里村群众说的好：“蒋介石的‘和平’是担挑子换肩哩，还一下劲，要准备大干呀！”这些宣传内容，拿上当地的具体事例，揭露蒋军的暴行，引起群众倾倒自己的冤苦，把我们当作了知心人。苗庄一个老汉说：“第一次向我村要三人，雇人掏了二百四十万，二次要了九人，闹的年青人大批逃亡。”下流村二百余户，逃跑的就有二百人，在家的不敢在家睡，眉岭年青人带上手榴弹，整天躲在地里。另一老汉说：“每亩地派款五千元，没有钱到家翻箱倒柜哩！”
