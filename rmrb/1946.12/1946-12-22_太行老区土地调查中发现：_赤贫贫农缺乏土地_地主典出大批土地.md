　　Land Survey in the Taihang Old Liberated Area Reveals:
    Extreme Poor Peasants Lack Land
    Landlords Lease Out Large Amounts of Land
    Land Leases are Variable
    Middle Peasants are Uneasy About Production

    [This Newspaper Reports] In order to implement "Land to the Tiller" this winter, the Taihang Second Military Subdistrict conducted surveys in old liberated areas such as Yushe and Wuxiang regarding the history from rent and interest reduction to land reform. The surveys revealed that although land relations in the old liberated areas have undergone fundamental changes after several years of rent and interest reduction, many problems remain. Most villages still have extreme poverty, and landlords and feudal rich peasants still retain feudal exploitation. For example, in Dongyadijie Village, Licheng County, poor peasants, farm laborers, and the extremely poor account for 35% of the village population, but they only own a little over 11% of the land. Many of these people lack land and still need a thorough transformation. In Piyancun Village, Wuxiang County, during the debt settlement in 1942, landlords managed to transfer a large amount of land, with one family leasing out 206 mu (of which 185 mu was rented land). Very few of these were converted into outright sales, and many of the original tenants became leaseholders, rising to become new middle peasants. Everyone thought there were no landlords in the village anymore, but these people who cultivated leased land could not focus on production. They said, "Our liberation will only last three years, and if they take back the land, we will fall back down again." These people also have demands to stabilize their self-cultivation of leased land. In addition, in past mass movements, it was mostly the victims who gained benefits, and when landlords sold land, poor peasants lacked the ability to buy it, so cadres and middle peasants bought more. For example, in Piyancun Village, middle peasants bought 243 mu of land in recent years, while poor peasants only bought 74 mu. Some who were considered "poor to the bone" had no basis for struggle and no ability to buy land, so they remained unliberated for seven or eight years. In this spring's mass movement, there was insufficient understanding of these complex situations. Many people had the idea that "the landlords have fallen, but the poor have not been liberated." Some masses reflected that "the wealthy have been overthrown, but the cadres have become rich," and "to be liberated, we must struggle against the cadres." At that time, the leadership did not understand these underlying problems and lacked clear thinking, believing that the cadre problem had become an obstacle to the liberation of the masses. After investigation, it was recognized that although some cadres had obtained more benefits in the past, they were not the "obstacle" to the thorough liberation of the masses. The main problem was that the remnants of feudalism had not been completely eliminated. The Wuxiang County Party Committee raised the questions "Have the landlords and feudalism been completely eliminated?" and "Have the poor been thoroughly liberated?" in training classes. Everyone engaged in heated discussions, and many villages discovered various ways in which landlords were secretly hoarding land. Yongquan Village did an accounting and found that out of the village's 38 qing of land, landlords held 10 qing in variable lease contracts. Only then did they clarify the goal of thoroughly eliminating feudalism. From the discovery of these problems, further investigation of the root causes led many cadres to reflect on their own shortcomings and simplistic work styles, arousing historical consciousness. Some said, "The land problem is truly not simple. Our work style is good at creating a whirlwind but bad at making it rain." They resolved to lead their poor brothers to a thorough liberation.

### 太行老区土地调查中发现：  赤贫贫农缺乏土地  地主典出大批土地

　　太行老区土地调查中发现：
    赤贫贫农缺乏土地
    地主典出大批土地
    土地是活契
    中农生产不安心
    【本报讯】太行二分区为在今冬贯彻耕者有其田，在老区榆社、武乡等地进行了群众减租减息到实行土地改革的历史的调查，提出老区经过几年来减租减息，土地关系虽有了基本的变化，但还遗留不少问题，多数村留有赤贫，地主封建富农也还保留封建剥削。如黎城东崖底村贫农雇农赤贫共占全村人口百分之三十五，而所有土地则仅占全村土地百分之十一强，这许多人缺乏土地，还要求翻透身。武乡皮烟村四二年清债时，地主将大批土地设法转移，有一家即典出二百零六亩（其中租地占一八五亩），很少变死契的，原佃户不少变为承典人，上升为新中农。大家以为本村没地主了，但这些种活契地的人都不能安心生产，他们说：“咱这翻身只翻三年，人家一抽地咱就又倒了。”这些人也有解决典地稳定自耕的要求。另外在过去群运中多是苦主得果实，地主卖地贫农又缺乏购买力，干部及中农买得的多些。如皮烟数年来中农买得地二百四十三亩，贫农只买得七十四亩；有些所谓“穷断了根”的，既没斗争题目也无力买地，七八年来始终没翻身。今春群运中，对这些复杂的情况认识不够，不少人都存在“地主已倒了，穷人没翻身”的观念，有些群众反映“倒了老财，翻了干部”，“要翻身就得斗干部”，当时领导上不了解这些潜在问题，思想不明确，认为干部问题成了群众翻身的一堵墙。经过调查认识到过去干部虽有些多得了果实，但并不是群众没翻透身的“一堵墙”，主要还是封建残余没彻底消灭。武乡县委在训练班提出“地主封建彻底消灭没有？”“穷人身翻透了没有？”大家展开热烈讨论，不少村发现地主各种各样的稳藏土地。涌泉算个账，全村三十八顷地，地主的活契典地就有十顷，这才明确了彻底消灭封建的斗争目标。从这些问题的发现里，进一步追老根，许多干部回顾到自己的毛病和简单作风，引起了历史自觉，有的说：“土地问题真不简单，咱这作风是刮风容易，下雨难。”决心领导穷苦弟兄翻透身。
