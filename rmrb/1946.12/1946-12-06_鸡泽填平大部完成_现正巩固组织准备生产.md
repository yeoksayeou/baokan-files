[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 1st dispatch] The mass movement in Jize, except for a dozen or so villages (mostly those with complex problems) which are still in the struggle phase, has victoriously concluded in the remaining 130 villages. In the nine villages of the Beifengzheng sub-district, farmers have recovered 2,080 mu of land, and livestock and vehicles worth a total of 15 million yuan. Each person has leveled three to four and a half mu of land, and all the impoverished peasants have risen to the status of middle peasants. Farmers' organizations have been formally established. The former Workers and Peasants Association has been changed to the Farmers' Association, with membership increasing from 547 to 1,595. Now that the struggle has ended, the villages are both distributing the fruits [of their victory] and consolidating their organizations. Some villages are actively preparing for winter production. Beifengzheng plans to open a lumber mill and an oil press, and also to establish a cooperative. Yingguanying has already begun to leach salt, having organized 19 salt ponds. Labor Hero Ye Wenzhang's mutual aid team plans to buy an ox, use a large cart to haul salt soil, and is also planning to open a tofu workshop.

　　鸡泽填平大部完成
    现正巩固组织准备生产
    【本报威县一日电】鸡泽群运除有十余个村庄（大多是问题复杂的村庄）尚在斗争阶段外，其余一百三十个村庄已胜利结束。北风正小区九个村农民即收回土地二○八○亩，牲口车辆共值一千五百万元。每人填平三亩到四亩半地，赤贫农全部上升为中农。农民组织正式建立，过去工农联合会改为农会，会员由五百四十七人增到一千五百九十五人。现在斗争结束，各村一面分配果实，一面巩固组织，有些村庄正积极准备冬季生产。北风正计划开木料厂一处、油坊一座，并要成立合作社；英官营已开始淋盐，整理好盐池子十九个；劳动英雄叶文章互助组计划买牛一头，用大车拉盐土，并筹开豆腐坊。
