　　After ideological awakening,
    Ji'nan's liberated peasants
    compete to give preferential treatment to military families
    [Our newspaper Weixian 22nd dispatch] Ji'nan has strengthened ideological education among the masses and conducted a major inspection of preferential treatment for military families. At a joint meeting of village cadres and military family members in the sixth district of Wuxun, after mutual reflection, the idea that village cadres found it troublesome was overcome, and a competition to provide preferential treatment to military families was launched in every village. Villages with fewer military families in the fifth district of Julu automatically helped villages with more military families, solving the difficulty of having many military families but few livestock. The village cadres' meeting in the first district of Pingxiang, consisting of sixty-four villages, decided that military families should not have any difficulties. Chen Hualiang, the director of the Chen Si Yuan Farmers' Association in Wuyi, personally led the masses to build houses for military families. Many people voluntarily donated surplus bricks, tiles, and wood, solving the housing problems of poor military families. In Fengzhuang Village, Guanxian, during the rent reduction campaign, the land of poor peasant military families was all supplemented to the level of middle peasants. In Dongwang Township, Ningnan, each military family member was given three acres of land and a glorious plaque was hung. Cadres and masses in Daning Village, Weixian, ideologically recognized that preferential treatment for military families is a regular task, not a crash assignment. The masses in the whole village specifically divided the work: the militia cultivated the land and repaired houses, the women's federation sewed and mended, and the children's corps carried water and picked up firewood. Fixed groups were responsible. The steamed bun shops, oil presses, hosiery makers, and small traders in the village unanimously offered significant discounts to military families. All students at Shenjia Village Elementary School in Xinhe helped military families collect firewood. After the slogan "Cultivate for military families first" was put forward in Houzhai, Wuyi, the masses scrambled to plow the land for military families, plowing more than 400 mu of land in three days. After the difficulties of military families were resolved in Baiguosi, Jize, thirty-seven military families wrote to their sons and brothers, telling them about the happy life at home and asking them to fight Lao Jiang with peace of mind and not to miss home. Renming Elementary School in Shenxian launched industrial production, solving the difficulty for children of poor revolutionary martyrs and military families to attend school. Merchants in Yingjie, Linqing City, actively donated money to military families and decided that the lunar New Year would be Military Support Day, and universal military support would be carried out.
