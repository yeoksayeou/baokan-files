Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 23rd—Popular uprisings have erupted in Wuchuan, Guisui, Baotou and other places in Suiyuan, threatening Fu Zuoyi's rear. Mutinous armed forces in Wuchuan are active in the vast areas from Wuchuan to Bailing, and from Wuchuan to Wulanhua. Other groups are active in the Sulaqi and four rural districts of Guisui. The popular uprising was triggered by Fu's conscription of soldiers and looting of grain. Wen Wendong, the Baotou garrison commander, led a team to pursue and suppress them, but to no avail.
