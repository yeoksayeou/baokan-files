　　Hurry Up and Check the Emancipation
    Landlord High Rent Exploitation Found in Xiangyuan Chengguan
    [This newspaper's Changzhi news] In Xiangyuan Chengguan, it was discovered that landlords are still exploiting peasants with high rents, and some bankrupt landlords are pretending to be activists, swindling the fruits of the struggle. At the beginning of the month, more than 90 cadres and activists in Chengguan County gathered to check the emancipation movement household by household, and found that 40 feudal landlords had not yet cut off their tails. Qin Futang, a landlord in Xiguan, rented eight mu of land to peasant Zhang Xuzhou, receiving five shi of rent every year, and this year he still rented it out as usual without liquidation. There are still 62 poor peasants who have not been thoroughly emancipated, such as Li Jinsuo in Nanguan, who still rents 25 mu. There are still 82 mu of land, six head of livestock, 45 shi of grain, more than 280 rooms, more than 125,000 yuan in silver dollars, and many clothes in the city that have not been distributed. Many of the distributed ones are also unfair. Three bankrupt landlords pretended to be activists and swindled the fruits of the masses. After inspection, many village cadres said: "In the past, we thought that we were emancipated and felt that the masses were almost the same, but we didn't expect that the peasants were not completely emancipated." Finally, the leadership resoundingly proposed: to conduct a household-by-household inspection, the fruits should be distributed quickly, and those that should not be divided should be returned. This winter, we must thoroughly complete the emancipation. Everyone was in high spirits and said: "Make another effort to completely emancipate ourselves."

　　快快检查翻身
    襄垣城关查出地主高租剥削
    【本报长治讯】襄垣城关发现地主仍旧高租剥削农民，若干破产地主呈伪装积极分子，骗取斗争果实。月初，该县城关干部积极分子九十余人，集会逐户检查翻身运动，发现四十户封建地主，尾巴仍未割掉；西关地主秦富堂，租给农民张许州八亩地，每年得租五石，今年还照旧出租，未经清算。贫苦农民尚有六十二户未翻透身，如南关李金锁还租种二十五亩。全城还有斗争果实八十二亩土地、六头牲口，四十五石粮食，二百八十余间房，大洋十二万五千余元，及许多衣物均未分配，已分配的亦有很多不公，三户破产地主竟假装积极分子骗取了群众果实，经检查后，许多村干部都说：“过去认为自己翻了身啦就觉得群众也差不多啦，不想到农民还没彻底翻身”。最后领导上即响亮的提出：要进行一次挨户检查，果实要迅速分配，不应该分的要退还，今冬一定要把翻身搞彻底，大家情绪很高，都说：“再努一把劲，把身翻个透。”
