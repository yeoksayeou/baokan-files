　　[Report from our newspaper in Wei County, 23rd] Since late October, Ren County's land reform and examination movement has thoroughly eliminated the feudal exploitation of landlords in two-thirds of the county's 144 villages, achieving "land to the tiller." The masses recovered 40,895 mu of land and turned in 180 concealed firearms from landlords. Mass organizations have also developed unprecedentedly. Out of the county's 144,406 people, 65,321 have joined women's associations and militia organizations, accounting for over 90% of the county's 25,925 households. The review of this movement revealed that some areas mechanically transplanted the experiences of the new districts, the formulation of policies was not thorough and meticulous enough, the implementation of the middle peasant policy was not firm enough, and some villages misunderstood the meaning of leveling and making up deficiencies, harming the middle peasants; some villages' farmers' associations were afraid that they would have less to distribute after absorbing middle peasants, and remained closed off. Secondly, it was discovered that village cadres in Dongxuzhuang, Xietun, and other villages were afraid of "changes in the political climate," deceived the masses, and conducted sham struggles against landlords, but these have all been promptly corrected. On November 27th, in order to deepen the land reform, a joint conference of county, district, and village cadres was held, attended by 1,400 cadres and activists, including 350 women activists. The conference reflected on and examined issues such as the cadres' stand, the middle peasant policy, and the mass line, and clearly proposed that the losses suffered by middle peasants who were struggled against must be compensated when distributing the fruits of the struggle. Currently, 49 villages in the county are continuing to deepen the land reform, and 93 villages are carrying out consolidation work in a thorough and meticulous spirit, conducting widespread ideological education, reorganizing the militia, and resolving outstanding issues.

　　任县完成查减地区
    立即进行思想教育
    其余四十九村继续深入清算
    【本报威县廿三日电】任县翻身检查运动，自十月下旬至十一月底，全县一百四十四村中有三分之二村庄，已彻底消灭了地主的封建剥削，达到“耕者有其田”。群众追回土地四万零八百九十五亩，并交出地主隐蔽枪支一百八十支。群众组织亦空前发展，全县十四万四千四百零六人中，参加农妇会民兵组织的达六万五千三百二十一人，按户数统计占全县两万五千九百二十五户的百分之九十以上。检查这次运动，发现部分地区机械搬运新区大动经验，酝酿政策不够深入细致，执行中农政策不够坚决，部分村庄误解了填平补齐意义，伤害了中农；部分村庄农会怕吸收中农后自己少分果实，仍旧关门。其次发现东许庄、谢屯等村干部怕“变天”，欺骗群众，对地主进行了假斗争，但都已得到及时纠正。十一月二十七日，为深入查减，召开了县区村干部联席会，到会干部及积极分子一千四百人，并有妇女积极分子三百五十人，会上反省检查了干部立场，中农政策，群众路线等问题，明确提出在分果实时必需弥补被斗中农所受损失。目前全县四十九村继续深入查减，九十三村在深入细致的精神下，开展巩固工作，普遍进行思想教育，整理民兵，解决遗留题问。
