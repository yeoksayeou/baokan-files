Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. Yesterday at 5 PM, the CCP Northwest Bureau, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, the Joint Defense Headquarters, and the Border Assembly held a birthday celebration for Commander-in-Chief Zhu in the reception hall. At the celebration, Chairman Lin Boqu stated: "The celebration for Commander-in-Chief Zhu by all sectors of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia is the happiest festival for the people of the Border Region. Commander-in-Chief's sixty years of struggle are inseparable from the creation of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and various liberated areas. Now, the 1.6 million people of the entire Border Region have armed themselves to defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Yan'an. The people of the entire region have full confidence in crushing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." Then, Commander-in-Chief Zhu was invited to speak. He said: "People say I am old, but I am not reconciled. I believe that with the efforts of the liberated areas and the people of the whole country, and with the efforts of our two million party members and several million troops, we will certainly be able to defeat the dictatorial traitors. The emergence of a New China is something I will definitely be able to see." All sectors of Qiqihar City in the Northeast also held birthday celebrations for Commander-in-Chief Zhu's sixtieth birthday from the 1st to the 3rd of this month.
