　　Using the Masses' Own Experience
    To Raise the Masses' Awareness
    ——Experience in Propaganda and Mobilization Work in Wuan New District
    Wu Yun
    I. Establish the Idea of Uniting with the Backward

    In some places, after activists emerge, they demand immediate struggle, are not good at waiting and mobilizing the broad masses of intermediate and backward people, and even have the idea of looking down on backward farmers, saying that they "don't raise issues when they have them, and don't want their blood and sweat." "They're afraid to speak up, only wanting to reap the benefits." "They doze off in meetings and are afraid of taking responsibility, just following the crowd." "Whether they participate or not, it doesn't take much effort." "Backward elements have many lackeys, they ruin things more than they help." To break through these thoughts among the masses, we must first use the method of tracing the root of backwardness to discuss: "Backwardness is not innate, it is the influence of the landlords in the old society, we also came from backwardness." Then we can use the method of comparing strength with the landlords to further discuss: "If the backward are not mobilized, the landlords will use them." "Helping the backward is helping ourselves." Recognizing that "mobilizing the backward is fighting with the landlords for the masses," this fundamentally solves the contradiction between the advanced and the backward in terms of fundamental ideology, inspires the sense of responsibility of the activists, and tells the activists: "We are the locomotive, and the masses are the train cars." "The backward are exploited by the landlords, it's our fault for not educating them." And put forward the slogan: "The advanced and the backward are one family, unity makes the struggle for liberation stronger." "There are no backward people, only backward work." Activists in the Third District put forward: "No backward villages, no backward people." "Give the backward a hand, if they can't stand up, help them." "Mobilize the backward, unite for struggle." Activists use the method of untying knots to dispel various ideological concerns of the backward, and put forward: "Don't put things in the landlord's house, don't conceal or harbor them for the landlord, the poor are one family, don't be fooled by the landlord." "Settle accounts early, strike while the iron is hot, if you let this opportunity pass, you'll regret it for life." This has played a very good role in mobilizing backward masses to participate in the movement.

    II. "Hired poor and middle peasants are one family, we'll never ride horses or sit in sedans."

    Some people treat middle peasants as outsiders, saying: "Middle peasants are two-faced." "Grass on the wall sways both ways." Some say: "Middle peasants are snobbish, they only look up and want to climb up, they are not wholeheartedly with the poor." Others say: "Middle peasants have enough to get by, they are not active in struggle." In short, they only see the shortcomings of the middle peasants without analyzing the source of the shortcomings. To solve these thoughts in each village, we must first start from understanding the middle peasants, analyzing whether the middle peasants belong to the exploiting class or the exploited class? The masses in Tonghui Village discussed from the oppression and exploitation suffered by the middle peasants from the enemy puppets, traitors, bullies, rent, interest, burdens and corvée labor: "If the Eighth Route Army hadn't come to our village, those lands would have become the property of the Yang and Song landlord families, the middle and poor peasants are on the same path." "Middle peasants have hatred with the landlords, poor peasants and middle peasants are connected by fate." And analyzed: "Middle peasants have shortcomings, it's the fault of the old society, who wasn't afraid of the rich in the past?" "Middle peasants are not active because they can't get anything, middle peasants listen to the landlords, afraid of having their chives cut." The masses in Beishangshi said: "Hired poor and middle peasants are one family, we'll never ride horses or sit in sedans." Recognizing that the middle peasants are also exploited and suffering people. Then further compare strength with the landlords, calculate the strength of the middle peasants, the masses in Tonghui said: "If we don't want the middle peasants, they'll go with the landlords." "Middle peasants account for the majority of the population, if we lose the middle peasants, we'll lose more than half of the force." Recognizing the significance of uniting with the middle peasants, this gradually established the conscious leadership of the hired poor peasants. The masses in the Third District explained the policies to the middle peasants, proposing: "Filling in the gaps is not cutting chives, it is eliminating feudal forces; struggle is not fighting time, it is struggling against the landlords' harshness to the poor." "If the middle peasants have problems, we'll discuss them later, we're all one family, how can we not handle it well?" "We don't struggle against our own people, we don't stab ourselves in the leg." Tenants in Tonghui proposed to the middle peasants: "Those who are not in the peasant association can also share the fruits of this struggle, after filling the gaps, we'll pave it flat again (meaning to pave another layer)." The slogan "Welcome middle peasants to join the peasant association." Shangtuancheng specifically convened middle peasant forums to discuss their thoughts, dispel their concerns, and mobilize middle peasants to complain about their sufferings, thus attracting a large number of middle peasants to join the movement.

    III. "The poorer the past, the more you get, the deeper the hole, the more you fill."

    In discussing the distribution of fruits, the masses first discussed whose fruits they were? The masses in Tonghui said: "The fruits are the blood and sweat of the poor exploited by the landlords." An old man said: "Getting these things back is like getting back what I lost in the past." Recognizing the rationality, legality, and conscience of "land returning home" and "fruits returning home," then they discussed how the fruits were obtained? The masses said: "It was given by the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party." "It was obtained through everyone's struggle, without everyone's complaints, raising issues, and struggling to demand debts, we wouldn't be able to get these things back." Therefore, the masses immediately proposed the slogan: "Turning over to become prosperous, don't forget the Communist Party, all the people follow Chairman Mao." "Everyone struggles, everyone makes the decision to distribute the fruits, everyone turns over." Then discuss how to distribute the fruits, and what should be done with the fruits? The narrow selfishness of the peasants is an obstacle to the rational distribution of the fruits. Some people are willing to divide equally according to the population, which is a reflection of the middle peasant thought. Some advocate dividing according to the size of the position and the merit, which is the opinion of the cadres and militiamen. Others propose to divide as soon as they arrive, divide by household, whoever wants what takes what, the level of division is less or more... These are all representatives of the demands of a portion of the masses. We must not only take good care of the principle of uniting the majority of peasants, but also resolutely implement the policy of eliminating extreme poverty. The masses in each village fully promoted the peasant class's mutual aid and the active thought of class liberation, and created many ways to fill in the gaps. The masses said: "The poor are one family, don't compete for profit, the struggle is all for filling the gaps." "Everyone struggles, everyone turns over." "The bigger the landlord, the more poor people he exploits, the poorer the peasant, the more blood and sweat he gives." "The five fingers are not the same length, the poor's past is not the same." "The poorer the past, the more you get, the deeper the hole, the more you fill." "If one person is poor, the whole village suffers." "If there's a hump, it will trip you, if there's a hole, it will block you, helping the poorest to turn over is also for the sake of our whole village." "Everyone turns over, unites with one heart, the landlord can't use the backward poor anymore." Cadres also proposed: "Everyone's things belong to everyone, no one will gossip, and the landlord can't sabotage us." "In the past, we all got more, this time we should let others get more." "Cadres have great merit, they sweat and work hard, but the one who has more merit than us is Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao doesn't give everyone a little bit, we shouldn't get more than everyone either." After distributing the fruits, the masses proposed: "The fruits are blood and sweat, don't sit and eat them, don't sit and wear them, use them as a capital for production." In many villages, the masses also launched production and wealth plans, encouraging each other to use the fruits of the struggle to buy livestock, farm tools, and small sheep. This is the result of good propaganda and mobilization, which has raised the class consciousness of the masses.

    提高群众觉悟
    ——武安新区宣传鼓动工作经验

    一、树立团结落后思想
    有些地方积极分子起来以后，要求马上就斗，不善于等待和发动广大中间落后群众，甚至还有看不起落后农民的思想，说他们“有问题不提，有血汗不要。”“吃油怕腥嘴，光吃现成饭。”“开会打盹睡觉，遇事怕拉膀随众。”有没有他们参加，不吃多大劲。”“落后分子狗腿多，不成事还坏事。”群众打通这些忠想，要首先用追落后根的办法，讨论出：“落后不是生来就落后，是旧社会地主的影响，咱们也是从落后变来的。”然后可用和地主比力量的办法进一步讨论出：“落后不发动，老财要利用。”“帮助落后就是帮助自己。”认识到：“发动落后是和地主争群众。”这样就从根本思想上解决了先进与落后的矛盾，启发了积极分子的责任感，同会积极分子说：“咱们是火车头，群众是火车箱。”“落后受老财利用，怨咱们没有教育过来。”并提出：“先进落后是一家，团结翻身力量大。”“没有落后人，只有落后工作。”“开展劝说运动”的口号。三区积极分子则提出：“不留落后村，不留落后人。”“落后分子搀一把，站不起来扶扶他。”“发动落后层，联合起斗争。”积极分子用解疙瘩的办法给落后分子解除各种思想顾虑，并提出：“不给地主放东西，不替地主隐瞒包庇，穷人是一家，不上地主的当。”“算账要趁早，打铁要趁热，放过这一回，误了这一辈。”的口号。这对发动落后群众参加运动都起了很好的鼓动作用。
    二、“雇贫中农是一家，骑马坐轿没有咱。”
    有的人把中农当外人，说：“中农是二胰子（中间派）。”“墙上草两边倒。”有的说：“中农嫌贫爱富，眼睛朝上，光想往上爬，给穷人不一心。”还有人说：“中农时光够过了，斗争不积极。”总之，只看见中农的缺点而不分析缺点来源。各村解决这些思想，首先就从认识中农开始，分析中农到底是属于剥削阶级的还是被剥削阶级的人？同会村群众从中农所受敌伪、奸霸、租息、负担和支差等压迫剥削中讨论出：“俺村的地要不是八路军过来，那块不成了杨、宋几家老财的，中农、贫农走的是一条路。”“中农和老财有仇冤，贫农和中农命相连。”并分析出：“中农有缺点，怨旧社会的过，过去时候谁不害有钱的怕？”“中农不积极，因为分不到东西，中农听了老财话，害怕割他韭菜。”北上石群众说：“雇贫中农是一家，骑马坐轿没有咱。”认识了中农也是被剥削的受苦人。然后进一步和地主比力量，计算中农力量，同会群众说：“中农咱不要，就跟地主走了。”“中农占老多的人口，去了中农咱就少了多半的人马。”认识了团结中农的意义，这样就逐渐树立起雇贫农的领导自觉。三区群众向中农解释政策提出：“填平不是割韭菜，是消灭封建势力；斗争不是斗时光，是斗争地主刻薄穷人。”“中农有问题，随后再商议，都是一家人，怎也好处理。”“自己人不斗争自己人，刀子不往自己腿上插。”同会佃户向中农提出：“这次斗争不在农会的也能分果实，填平以后还要铺平（再铺一层的意思）。”“欢迎中农入农会”的口号。上团城则专门召集中农座谈心思，去心病，发动中农诉苦，这样就吸引了广大中农卷入这次运动。
    三、“时光越穷越多分，圪道越深越多填。”
    群众在讨论果实分配中，首先讨论果实是谁的？同会群众说：“果实是老财剥削的穷人血汗。”一个老汉说：“要回这些东西，都是我过去丢了的。”认识了“土地回家”，“果实回家”的合理合法合良心，然后又讨论果实怎样得来的？群众说：“是八路军共产党给的。”“是大家斗争得来的，没有大家诉苦提问题斗争要账，就要不出这些东西。”因此群众即提出：“翻身发时光，不忘共产党，所有老百姓都随毛主席。”“大家斗争，大家作主分果实，大家翻身”的口号。然后讨论果实怎样分，分到果实应该怎样？农民的狭隘自私是合理分配果实的障碍，有的人愿意按人口平均分，这是中农思想的反映。有的人主张按职务大小功劳厚薄分，这是干部民兵的意见。还有的人提议随到随分，按户分，谁想要啥拿啥，等级分的少些或多些……这都是各代表各的一部分群众要求，我们既要很好照顾团结多数农民的原则，又要坚决贯彻消灭赤贫的方针，各村群众充分发扬了农民阶级互助和阶级翻身的积极思想，创造了许多填平的办法。群众说：“穷人一家不争利，斗争为的都填平。”“大家斗争，大家翻身。”“越大的地主剥削的穷人越多，越穷的农民出的血汗越多。”“五个指头不一般长，穷人时光不一样。”“时光越穷越多分，圪道越深越多填。”“一人受穷，全村受累。”“有圪台要绊脚，有圪道要拦腿，帮助最穷的翻身也是为了咱全村。”“大家翻了身，联合一条心，地主就不能再利用落后穷人。干部也提出：“大家东西归大家，没有人家说闲话，地主也没法破坏咱。”“过去都是咱们分的多，这回也该让人家多分了。”“干部功劳大，出汗又出力，功劳比咱更大的是毛主席，毛主席不分大家一点，咱也不该多分大家的。”分了果实群众提出：“果实是血汗，不坐吃、不坐穿，用作生产大本钱。”有许多村群众还发动订生产发家计划，互相鼓励把斗争果实用来买牲口、买农具和小份羊，这就是经过很好的宣传鼓动，提高了群众阶级觉悟的结果。
