　　Attention! Influenza
    [This newspaper's report] According to Director Zhu of the Health Bureau, many people in Party, government, and military organizations, as well as residents, have been falling ill since the beginning of winter. Initially, the temperature may be high or low, but in the following days, it remains stagnant. Some believe it to be malaria, others believe it to be typhoid fever, but after treating it as influenza, they gradually recover. This type of illness has both major and minor epidemics. The current situation is still a minor epidemic. People who work hard and have weak resistance are easily infected. After infection, people experience extreme weakness and cannot recover in the short term. The illness is divided into respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous system types, depending on which system the bacteria invades. Simple ways to prevent this disease include regularly gargling with boric acid water or salt water, frequently exercising outdoors to get fresh air, aiding digestion, enhancing resistance, and wearing a mask when in contact with patients.

　　注意！流行性感冒
    【本报讯】据卫生局朱局长告记者：入冬以来，党政军各机关及居民患病者甚多，开始温度或高或低，而后几日则停留不降，有以为是虐疾症、有以为是伤寒，结果按流行性感冒对症治疗，则逐渐恢复痊愈，该种病症，有大流行与小流行，现在情况还是小流行，工作劳苦抵抗力弱的人容易感染，感染后，人有显极度衰弱，非短期可以恢复的。该症分呼吸系、胃肠系、与神经系，视病菌侵入何种系统而称。预防这种病的简易方法：就是常用硼酸水或盐水漱口，常去室外运动换取新鲜空气，帮助消化，增强抵抗力，接触病人时要带口罩。
