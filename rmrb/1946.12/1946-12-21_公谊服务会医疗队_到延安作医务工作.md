American Friends Service Committee Medical Team Arrives in Yan'an for Medical Work

	Dr. Ge Yefu said: "In the KMT areas, only patients with money can receive medical treatment; doctors watch those without money die."

	[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] The American Friends Service Committee (formerly the Friends Ambulance Unit) medical team, consisting of six members, arrived in Yan'an two weeks ago. They were accompanied by Mr. Viring, the director of the organization in China, on the 2nd, flying from Zhengzhou to Yan'an. A week ago, they joined the medical work at the International Peace Hospital main hospital. The team leader is Dr. Peterj, a British physician specializing in internal medicine. The team includes one doctor, two technicians, and two nurses. They brought with them three tons of medicine, equipment, and books, half of which were donated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Welfare Fund Committee and the Red Cross Societies of the United Kingdom and the United States. After arriving in Yan'an, they were hosted at a banquet by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and others. Dr. Ge Yefu (Dr. De ebeirtoyx) recounted the team's work in the KMT-controlled areas of northern Henan to reporters, saying, "In the Kuomintang areas, only patients with money can receive medical treatment; doctors watch those without money die. The Guangsheng Hospital in Anyang has ninety beds, but it cannot admit patients for this reason. Doctors who graduate from medical schools run by the Kuomintang government mostly make money in big cities and do not go to the countryside to treat patients." Captain Ye expressed his willingness to serve in Yan'an for one year or more.

　　公谊服务会医疗队
    到延安作医务工作
    葛叶馥大夫说：“在蒋区有钱的病人才能就医，没钱的病人医生眼看着他病死。”
    【新华社延安十八日电】来延已两周余之公谊服务会（原名公谊救护队）医疗队一行六人，自二日由该会驻华主任维林氏（Mr·Viring）陪同自郑州飞抵延安后，周前即已参加国际和平医院总院医务工作。该队队长为英籍内科医生叶彼得大夫（Dr·Peterj），其队员中有医生一人，技师二人，及护士二人。来延时随带药品器材书籍三吨，半为联总中国福利基金委员会及英美各国红十字会捐赠。来延后，曾受朱总司令等欢宴。该队葛叶馥大夫（Dr·De ebeirtoyx）对记者叙述该队在豫北蒋管区工作情形以后，他说：“在国民党地区有钱的病人才能就医，没有钱的病人医生眼看着他病死。安阳的光生医院有九十个床位，即因此不能收容病人。国民党政府举办的医科学校，毕业的医生大都在大城市里赚钱，而不到乡村里治病。”叶队长表示在延志愿服务一年或一年以上。
