　　Gongguang and Guhaojing Villages
    Landmines Repel an Enemy Battalion
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] In Anyang, Gongguang and Guhaojing villages have been highly effective in deploying explosives, repelling an enemy battalion and killing or wounding 13 enemy soldiers. On the 9th of this month, an enemy battalion advanced towards Gongguang and Guhaojing villages. The explosion squads of both villages had laid minefields in advance, waiting for the enemy. When the enemy reached midway to Guhaojing village, they immediately detonated three landmines in succession, killing three enemies. However, the enemy stubbornly continued to advance. As they approached the village edge, they detonated two more mines, killing one and wounding another. They dared not take the main road and detoured to another road. However, this road was exactly where the Gongguang village explosion squad had laid a minefield. As they approached the edge of Gongguang village, they detonated four more mines, killing and wounding four people. The enemy panicked and took a small path. The two landmines buried in the small path exploded again, and four more enemies lay in pools of blood. During the enemy's confusion, our ambushing militiamen opened fire on the enemy, driving away the entire enemy battalion.

　　公光和古好井两村
    地雷炸退一营敌人
    【本报特讯】安阳公光和古好井二村，爆炸开展的好，爆炸击退敌一营之众，共毙伤敌十三名。本月九日敌一个营向公光村和古好井村进犯，该两村爆炸队预先布好雷阵，等候敌人。当敌走到古好井村中途时，即一连踏响三个地雷，三个敌人也同归于尽，但敌人执迷不悟，继向前进，刚一接近村边时，又踏响了两颗，死伤各一，乃不敢走正路，绕至另一条路前进，但这条路正是公光村爆炸队所布置的一个雷阵，刚接近公光村边又踏响四颗，毙伤四人，敌人惊慌走小路，埋在小路的两颗地雷又爆炸了，敌人为躲避已响的地雷，又踏响了两颗，敌人四名又卧在血泊里了。在敌人慌乱的时候，我埋伏的民兵向敌展开射击，将一营之众的敌人赶跑了。
