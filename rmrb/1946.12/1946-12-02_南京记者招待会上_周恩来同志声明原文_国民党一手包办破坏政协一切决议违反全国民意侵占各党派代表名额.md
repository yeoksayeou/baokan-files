Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th (Delayed Dispatch): General Zhou Enlai of the CPC Delegation in Nanjing held press conferences at 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM today, respectively, and issued the following statement:

　　The "National Assembly" unilaterally organized by the Kuomintang government opened yesterday. This "National Assembly" was convened solely by a one-party government in violation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) and national public opinion, and the Chinese Communist Party resolutely opposes it. Not only was the date of this "National Assembly" not agreed upon by the PCC, but more importantly, it is a "National Assembly" convened by one party and is divisive, rather than a united National Assembly attended by all parties. The National Assembly agreed upon by the PCC, in accordance with the PCC resolutions and its procedures and spirit, must be convened after the PCC resolutions are implemented step by step and under the leadership of the reorganized government.

　　The various resolutions of the PCC are the temporary great charter agreed upon by all parties and are an indivisible whole. In the past ten months, not only have the PCC resolutions not been implemented in the slightest, but they have also been completely sabotaged by the Kuomintang authorities. The truce agreement was approved by the PCC resolutions, but the civil war has raged from outside the Great Wall to inside the Great Wall. The government authorities have thoroughly destroyed the truce order issued in January. The four promises announced by the government authorities at the opening of the PCC, from the bloody incident at Jiaochangkou to the assassinations of Li and Wen, have been completely destroyed by the Kuomintang secret service rule. The government reorganization has failed to achieve agreement, and the Program for Peaceful National Construction has therefore been impossible to implement. As for the local governments in many liberated areas, the Kuomintang authorities not only do not allow them to maintain the status quo as stipulated in the program but also want to implement "takeover," resorting to armed occupation if they refuse. The basic spirit of the military resolution is the separation of military and civilian affairs, but now almost all the chairmen of the Kuomintang government's provinces are serving military officers. The review of the draft constitution was not completed in Chongqing, and the CPC representatives immediately made a statement of complete reservation. After arriving in Nanjing, the Kuomintang authorities shelved it until now and have never discussed it again. The agreement on the National Assembly issue was the last compromise during the PCC meeting. The Kuomintang authorities guaranteed that they would not convene a one-party-dominated, divisive National Assembly and guaranteed that the draft constitution reviewed and completed by the PCC would be passed. Only then would other parties allow the representatives monopolized by one party ten years ago to retain their seats in regional and occupational quotas, but it must include representatives of all parties and representatives of the liberated areas, and the PCC resolutions must be fully implemented, the people's freedom rights must be guaranteed, and the government must be reorganized before such a National Assembly can be convened to be considered a united National Assembly attended by all parties. The so-called "National Assembly" that has now opened not only violates the above resolutions and their spirit but even the date of the meeting or its postponement is determined by the one-party government. According to the government's announcement on the morning of November 15, the number of representatives has reached 1,580, encroaching on 410 representative seats of other parties in the original agreement of 2,050, especially encroaching on as many as 140 of the 200 representative seats in the liberated areas. It can be seen that this "National Assembly" is a completely one-party-dominated, divisive "National Assembly." The so-called vacant seats waiting for the CPC to participate are both a sabotage of the PCC and a complete deception. In reality, it is just an attempt to deceive other parties besides the CPC to participate in order to whitewash the personal dictatorship of the Kuomintang authorities.

　　In the past month, through the hard work of third-party figures in the Nanjing negotiations, the CPC has continuously proposed that the form of negotiations can be flexible, but they must be conducted in accordance with the resolutions and their procedures, which has been rejected by the government authorities. The closer the date of the one-party "National Assembly" gets, the more we advocate stopping the one-party "National Assembly" in order to facilitate the simultaneous meetings of the Military Mediation Team, the PCC Comprehensive Group, and the Constitutional Drafting Committee to resolve the current military and political issues based on the truce agreement, troop reorganization plan, and PCC resolutions, and implement them immediately. Only then can a united National Assembly attended by all parties be convened in a peaceful environment. However, the government authorities, eager to whitewash their dictatorship, have completely disregarded this.

　　The one-party "National Assembly" that has now opened not only renders the CPC's and the third party's recent proposals in the negotiations [three characters unclear], but also ultimately destroys all resolutions since the PCC, as well as the truce agreement and troop reorganization plan, cutting off the path of peaceful negotiations since the PCC; at the same time, it quickly and thoroughly exposes the deceptive nature of the government authorities' "truce order" of November 8.

　　This one-party "National Assembly" also wants to pass a so-called "constitution" to "legalize" dictatorship, "legalize" civil war, "legalize" division, and "legalize" the betrayal of the interests of the country and the people. If this continues, the Chinese people will surely fall into an abyss of suffering. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party firmly does not recognize this "National Assembly." The door to peace has been closed by the Kuomintang government authorities. We have no need to consider the tricks to be played in the one-party "National Assembly," or even the "reorganization of the government." Participating in this "National Assembly" and acknowledging these tricks would inevitably overturn the PCC resolutions and undermine the path of peace, democracy, unity, and unification since the PCC. There is no middle ground.

　　The bloody battles to attack the liberated areas are raging, and the US government's policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war remains unchanged. False peace and false democracy can absolutely deceive no one. We, the Chinese Communist Party, are willing to fight to the end with the Chinese people and all parties that are truly working for peace and democracy for true peace and true democracy!

　　南京记者招待会上
  　周恩来同志声明原文
  　国民党一手包办破坏政协一切决议违反全国民意侵占各党派代表名额
    【新华社南京十六日电】（迟到）中共驻京代表团周恩来将军，于今日下午二时及五时分别举行记者招待会，发表声明如次：
    国民党政府一手包办的“国民大会”，已于昨天开幕了，这一“国大”是违背政协决议与全国民意，而由一党政府单独召开的，中国共产党坚决反对。不但这一“国大”的开会日期未经政协协议，更重要的它是一党召开的、分裂的“国大”，而不是各党派参加的、团结的国大。政协协议的国大，照政协决议及其程序与精神，必须政协决议次第付诸实施之后，在改组后的政府领导之下，始能召开。
    政协各项决议，是各党派协议的临时大宪章，是一个整体而不可分割的。十个月来，政协决议不但未曾丝毫付诸实施，而且已被国民党当局破坏无遗。停战协定是经过政协决议批准的，但内战从关外大打到关内，政府当局已彻底破坏了一月间停战令的位置，政府当局在政协开幕时所宣布的四项诺言，从较场口大打直到李、闻暗杀案，已被国民党特务统治破坏得一干二净。政府改组迄夫协议成功，和平建国纲领遂亦无从实行；而对许多解放区的地方政府，国民党当局不仅不许其依照纲领规定维持现状，且欲实行“接收”，不允则实行武力占领。军事决议的基本精神是军民分治，但现在国民党政府的各省主席，几无不以现役军人充当。宪草审议在重庆既未完工，中共代表当即有全部保留之声明。到南京后，国民党当局更将其一搁至今，从未再议。国大问题的协议，是政协开会期中最后一个妥协，国民党当局保证不开一党包办的、分裂的国大，并保证通过政协审议完成的宪草，其他党派方允许十年前一党包办的代表得保留在区域与职业的名额之中，但必须包括各党派并代表与解放区代表在内，应完全将政协决议付诸实施，人民自由权利得以保障及政府改组之后才能够召开这样的国大，方能算是各党。派参加的团结的国大。现在开幕的所谓“国大”，不只违背上述决议及其精神，便连开会日期或延期，也均由一党政府决定。代表名额，据十一月十五日上午政府已公布者，竟达一、五八○人，在原协议二、○五○人中，已侵占其他党派代表名额四一○人，尤其是已侵占解放区二百人代表名额至一四○人之多，可见这一“国大”是彻头彻尾一党包办的分裂的“国大”。所谓空出名额，等待中共参加，既系破坏政协，又系完全骗局，实际上只是想骗取中共以外的其他党派参加，以粉饰国民党当局个人独裁的面目而已。
    一月来，南京商谈经第三方面人士的辛勤努力，中共方面曾不断提议商谈形式可以不拘，但必须依照决议及其程序办事，均被政府当局拒绝。一党“国大”的会期愈近，我们愈主张停开一党“国大”，方有利于使军事三人会议、政协综合小组及宪草审议委员会得以同时开会，根据停战协定、整军方案与政协决议，解决当前的军事、政治问题，并立付实施，然后方能在和平的环境中，从容召开各党派参加的团结的国大。但急于粉饰独裁的政府当局，对此根本不予考虑。
    现在开幕的一党“国大”，不但使中共及第三方面最近在商谈中的主张成为（三字不明），并且最后破坏了政协以来的一切决议及停战协定与整军方案，隔断了政协以来和平商谈的道路；同时也很快的彻底揭穿了政府当局十一月八日“停战令”的欺骗性。
    这一党“国大”还要通过一个所谓“宪法”，把独裁“合法”化，把内战“合法”化，把分裂“合法”化，把出卖国家与人民的利益“合法”化。这样下去，中国人民一定陷入苦痛的深渊，因此，中国共产党坚决不承认这个“国大”。和平之门已为国民党政府当局一手关闭了，一党“国大”中将要玩的把戏，乃至“改组政府”，我们决无一顾之必要。参加了这一“国大”，承认了这些把戏，必然推翻了政协决议和破坏了政协以来和平、民主、团结、统一的轨道。中间的道路是没有的。
    进攻解放区之血战方殷，美国政府援蒋内战的政策依然未变，假和平、假民主，绝对欺骗不了人，我们中国共产党愿同中国人民及一切真正为和平民主而努力的党派，为真和平、真民主奋斗到底！
