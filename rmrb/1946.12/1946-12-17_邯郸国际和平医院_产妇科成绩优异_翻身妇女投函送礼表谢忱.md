Handan International Peace Hospital
    Obstetrics Department Achieves Excellent Results
    Liberated Women Send Letters and Gifts to Express Gratitude
    [This newspaper reports] Comrade Zhu Lian, director of Handan International Peace Hospital (formerly the Border Region Health Bureau), is enthusiastically concerned about women's suffering. From the very beginning of the bureau's establishment, despite extreme difficulties, she gathered some imperfect obstetrics and gynecology equipment. A gynecology and obstetrics department was specially set up in the mobile clinic directly under the Health Bureau, and female medical assistants Liu Hanxing, and female nurses Zhu Guizhen, Pei Mei, Zhou Jingjie, and others were given midwifery training. In more than half a year of work, significant results have been achieved. In terms of medical services, specifically gynecology and obstetrics, statistics from mid-March to early December show: gynecology treated a total of 1,459 times, including 414 initial diagnoses and 1,045 follow-up visits, with 254 cases definitely registered as cured. Obstetrics examined fetal positions 189 times, including 91 initial diagnoses and 98 follow-up visits; 63 deliveries were performed, including 11 cases of difficult labor. None of the women who were assisted in childbirth developed puerperal fever, and none of the newborns developed tetanus (commonly known as umbilical cord wind or four-six wind). The hospital, in treating gynecological diseases, helped women who had been infertile for many years to become pregnant, breaking the superstition of burning incense and kowtowing to gods for sons and daughters. After the hospital moved to the countryside, many liberated women from villages 10 to 50 li away rushed to the outpatient department for examinations. In six outpatient visits, 24 women who had been infertile for six to fifteen years sought treatment. The following is a letter from women in Niutou Village after receiving treatment: We are deeply grateful for your hospital's special diagnosis and treatment, from which we have benefited greatly. With utmost sincerity, we offer six chickens to express our gratitude. Respectfully, Wang Guie, Wang Guixiang, Jing Ming, Jiang Zhongqing, Wang Chunying, Fengzi, Niutou Village.

　　邯郸国际和平医院
    产妇科成绩优异
    翻身妇女投函送礼表谢忱
    【本报讯】邯郸国际和平医院（前身是边区卫生局）局长朱琏同志，热心关切妇女痛苦。该局初创伊始，即在极度困难下凑合了一些不完善的妇产科器械，在卫生局直属流动诊疗所中特设妇产科一门，将女医助刘寒星及女护士中朱贵珍、裴梅、周静洁等同志给以助产训练。半年多来的工作中，已获显著成绩，在医务方面，就妇科产科一项，从三月中旬到十二月上旬统计：妇科共诊一千四百五十九次，内初诊四百十四名，复诊一千零四十五次，确实登记的治愈数二百五十四名。产科检查胎位的一百八十九次，其中初诊九十一名，复诊九十八次；接产六十三名，其中难产十一名。所有被接产者，产妇未发生产褥热，初生儿未发生破伤风（俗称脐带风或四六风）。该院在诊妇科病中，使多年不孕症的妇女怀了孕，破除了烧香磕头求儿求女的迷信。当该院移驻农村后，附近十里至五十里村庄许多翻了身的妇女，都赶去门诊部检查，在六次的门诊，就有二十四名六年到中十五年不孕育妇女求治。下面是牛头村妇女经诊治后写来的信：敝等蒙贵院破格施诊，获益良多，不胜铭感，谨以至诚，奉上鸡六只，聊表寸忱，敬祈哂纳。牛头村王规娥、王规香、荆明、姜中清、王春英、疯子、敬启。
