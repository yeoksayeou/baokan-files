　　Life, Thrift, Donations
　　Taihang Supports the Front Lines
　　[This newspaper's Changzhi 7th dispatch] The movement to "Support the front lines with practical actions, defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend Chairman Mao" has penetrated deeply into the organs, rural areas, factories, and schools of Taihang. The Third Prefectural Committee recently called on the military and civilians of the entire region to launch a "Celebrate Victory, Support the Front Lines, Defend the Party Central Committee Movement" with three major practical actions: combat, work, and thrift. The comrades of the Prefectural Committee organs took the lead in responding by donating 4,000 yuan, and other comrades also actively donated money. The comrades of the Third Military Subdistrict's Military Committee responded to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's call for "heroic struggle and arduous struggle," launched a campaign to examine work style, and took out daily necessities to慰劳 the front lines. The Bo'ai County government decided to save manpower amidst the tense war, overcome difficulties, chop firewood and cut grass, and solve the problem of firewood themselves. Sun Baoyuan, the director of the joint branch of the Wuxiang Baihe Coal Mine workers, led the increase production and self-defense movement, donating more than 16,000 yuan to慰劳 the army, and the workers organized a backbone team to prepare for self-defense. The postal workers of seven counties and cities including Bo'ai, Qinyang, Wenxian, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Lingchuan, and Jiaozuo, and four postal stations in the Fourth Military Subdistrict, persevered in protecting the postal routes under the arduous cannon fire, and saved and donated more than 21,000 yuan and more than 230 jin of millet to support the front lines. The teachers and students of Taihang No. 2 Middle School previously organized turn-over teams to go to various counties to help the masses turn over; recently, they launched a donation movement, donating more than 22,000 yuan in one week. In addition to rectifying affairs and practicing thrift, the Third Middle School also launched a creation movement, with all teachers and students participating in writing scripts and folk songs, preparing to go deep into the countryside to carry out current affairs propaganda for the patriotic self-defense war. The Xiama Juntou Village in Pindin launched a one-liang-of-rice movement, with each person saving one liang of rice per day. Yin Shuishan, a liberated peasant in Zuoquan City, discussed with his wife and planned to sell the pig to buy guns for the militia. His wife said generously, "Give it to them, what is a pig? If the Eighth Route Army hadn't come, there wouldn't be this pig. As long as there are good times, it won't be difficult to raise another one." So he sold the pig for 15,000 yuan and gave it all to the militia.
