Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 22nd. From December 12th to 20th, according to incomplete statistics, the Lunan New Fourth Army has killed or captured over a thousand invading Chiang troops, shot down one American-made Chiang aircraft, and destroyed seven tanks. From the 13th to the 17th, the 44th Brigade of the 26th Division, the 80th Brigade of the 28th Division, and units of the 77th Division of the Chiang army, with 24 tanks, dozens of armored vehicles, and under the cover of three aircraft, fiercely attacked places like Waicheng and Bianzhuang, 70 li southwest of Linyi, several times. On the 13th, the New Fourth Army shot down one Chiang aircraft in the Da Xiao Qingshan area, killing or wounding over 200 Chiang soldiers. On the 17th, near Daicun, southwest of Bianzhuang, they used hand grenades combined with artillery fire to destroy seven Chiang army tanks, killing or capturing over 300 Chiang soldiers. The fighting is now expanding. In addition, the 108th Brigade and other units of the Chiang army, advancing from Tai'erzhuang, were intercepted by the New Fourth Army near Chahe, 30 li east of Tai'erzhuang, and made no progress.
Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 22nd. Reporter Liu Liang from the Subei front reports on the victorious scene at Xiaodianzi (20 li north of Suqian) after the annihilation of Chiang's 3rd Provisional Brigade (formerly a division): When the reporter, following the victorious New Fourth Army "Qingdao" unit, entered the recently recovered Xiaodianzi market street at 1200 hours on the 17th, raging fires illuminated the streets, and Chiang army corpses were scattered everywhere. A New Fourth Army soldier told the reporter that when our army charged to the front of the enemy position, the Chiang soldiers immediately raised their hands in surrender. Many enemies were captured by us. On the street, I saw jubilant New Fourth Army soldiers, each carrying several rifles on their backs, enthusiastically discussing the situation of the battle just now. At this time, large numbers of prisoners crowded the streets, many of whom volunteered to help the New Fourth Army carry the spoils of war. The captured mountain guns were still being pulled by the original Chiang army horses outside the village. The reporter strolled along the main street, which was over 700 meters long and wide, and saw piles of spoils of war. I inquired of an officer of the 3rd Provisional Brigade, wearing a lieutenant's uniform, in a group of prisoners, and he said: "For two days, under the infantry encirclement and artillery threat of the New Fourth Army, I was really on tenterhooks, thinking this was the last moment of my life, but now, after being captured, I am being treated so well that I feel happy."

　　鲁南战事扩展
    歼敌已达千余
    【新华社山东二十二日电】鲁南新四军自十二日迄廿日，据不完全统计，已毙俘进犯蒋军千余人，击落美制蒋机一架，击毁坦克七辆。十三日至十七日内，蒋军二十六师之四十四旅、二十八师之八十旅及七十七师等部，附坦克廿四辆，装甲车数十辆，在飞机三架掩护下，数度猛攻临沂西南七十里之外城、卞庄等地。新四军于十三日在大小青山一带击落蒋机一架，毙伤蒋军二百余，复于十七日在卞庄附近之戴村西南以手榴弹配合炮火击毁蒋军坦克七辆，毙俘蒋军三百余人。现战事正在扩展中。另有台儿庄出犯之蒋军一○八旅等部，在台儿庄东三十里岔河附近遭新四军阻击，无何进展。
    【新华社山东二十二日电】据苏北前线记者刘亮报导蒋军预三旅（原师）被歼后小店子（宿迁北二十里）胜利景象称：当记者随着胜利的新四军“青岛”部队，于十七日十二时进入刚被收复的小店子市街时，熊熊的大火，正照得大街通红，街上蒋军尸体狼藉。新四军一战士告记者，当我军冲至阵前时，蒋军即举手投降，敌被我俘虏甚多。在街上，我看见欢欣鼓舞的新四军战士们，每个人都背数支步枪，纵情地谈论着刚才战斗的情形。此时大批的俘虏拥挤街头，他们中有许多人自动帮助新四军搬运胜利品。缴获的山炮仍用蒋军原来的马匹和村外拉运。记者缓步于纵横七百多公尺的大街上，见到满堆积着的战利品。我顺便在一群俘虏中询问了一位着尉级军服的预三旅的军官，他说：“两天来在新四军步兵包围与炮兵威胁下，真是提心吊胆，以为这是自己生命的最后一刻，可是现在被俘以后，受到如此优待，倒觉得愉快”。
