Friends of War Criminals
*Liberation Daily* Seventh Commentary

　　Japanese war criminals are the sworn enemies of the Chinese people, but Chiang Kai-shek treats Japanese war criminals as good friends. This fact has been proven by Chiang Kai-shek's preferential treatment of Okamura Neiji, the number one Japanese fascist war criminal who invaded China. Peng Xuepei, Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of Propaganda, further nakedly exposed this fact in a press conference on the 5th. When a reporter asked, "Where is Okamura Neiji now?" Peng replied, "Okamura Neiji is still assisting in the repatriation of un-repatriated Japanese residents and prisoners of war in the capacity of liaison officer."

　　Okamura Neiji was the executioner who implemented the "kill all, burn all, loot all" Three Alls Policy against the people of North China. Precisely because he was most effective at slaughtering the Chinese people, Okamura Neiji was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army's China Expeditionary Force, becoming the number one war criminal directly responsible for the invasion of China. Chiang Kai-shek actually hired such a heinous criminal as a "liaison officer" for the repatriation of prisoners of war. What shred of national conscience is left in such an action! This shameless behavior is rare throughout history! According to this approach, the Allied countries should also hire Göring, Keitel and others as "liaison officers," rather than imposing the death penalty on these fascist murderers.

　　In order to cover up this behavior, Chiang Kai-shek, devoid of conscience, slanderously claimed: "The Chinese Communists are retaining Japanese people and Japanese prisoners of war." This is truly a daytime hallucination and not worth refuting. Everyone knows that all Japanese prisoners of war in the Liberated Areas were repatriated long ago without the help of Okamura's "assistance." In the Liberated Areas, Japanese war criminals not only do not have the right to be "liaison officers," but none can escape the people's righteous and severe punishment.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's crime of using the remnants of Japanese fascists to slaughter the Chinese people cannot be concealed. Peng Xuepei said: "At present, there are still some Japanese residents and retained Japanese technical personnel within China who have not been completely repatriated." These so-called "un-repatriated" Japanese are the Japanese soldiers and technicians used in Chiang's army (such as those in Yan Xishan's army). Chiang Kai-shek's plan to use the remnants of Japanese fascists as tools for civil war has been approved and supported by his master - American imperialism. According to reliable sources, Chiang has already agreed to use Japanese soldiers as instructors for Chiang's army. Therefore, the "retention" and the role of "liaison officer" of Okamura Neiji, a leader of Japanese fascist officers, are by no means accidental. Okamura Neiji's "rich experience" in slaughtering the Chinese people is certainly highly valued by Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism.

　　In the face of the Chinese people's powerful democratic movement, Chiang Kai-shek, in addition to relying on the aid of American imperialism, has to beg for mercy from the remnants of Japanese fascists. This shows how fragile Chiang Kai-shek's foundation of rule is! Okamura Neiji and other Japanese war criminals are defeated generals at the hands of the Chinese anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians, especially the soldiers and civilians of the North China Liberated Areas. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to "retain" these fellows to deal with the People's Liberation Army, which is even stronger than during the Anti-Japanese War, is doomed to fail. And this measure, which lacks national consciousness and undermines world peace, will inevitably be resolutely opposed by all Chinese compatriots and the world's righteous public opinion.

　　The blood debt of the Japanese fascist warlords who slaughtered the Chinese people must be repaid. Notorious war criminals such as Okamura Neiji must be publicly executed like Göring and others, and traitors and imperialist elements who willingly join the ranks of these war criminals will surely face the judgment of the people one day.

### 战犯的朋友　解放日报七日时评

　　战犯的朋友
  　解放日报七日时评
    日本战犯是中国人民不共戴天的仇敌，但是蒋介石却把日本战犯当作好朋友，这一事实已被蒋介石对日本法西斯侵华第一等战犯冈村宁次的优待所证明。而五日蒋介石的宣传部长彭学沛在记者招待会上的谈话更赤裸裸地暴露这一事实。当记者质问“冈村宁次现在何处”时，彭氏答称：“冈村宁次现仍以联络官资格协助遣送未遣完之日侨日俘”。
    冈村宁次是对华北人民实行杀光烧光抢光三光政策的刽子手，正因为他屠杀中国人民最有办法，冈村宁次才被擢升为日寇的中国派遣军总司令，成为直接侵略中国的第一号战犯。对于这样一个罪大恶极的罪犯，蒋介石竟聘请他做遣送俘虏的“联络官”，这种做法还有什么丝毫民族天良可言！这种无耻的行径也是古今中外所稀有的！照这种做法，同盟各国也应聘请戈林季德尔等人做“联络官”，而不应该对这些法西斯凶手施以绞刑了。
    为了掩饰这种行为，蒋介石丧尽天良的诬称：“中共留用日人日俘”。这真是，白昼见鬼的梦呓，是不值得一驳的。谁都知道，解放区内所有日俘从未借助于冈村的“协助”，而早就遣送完毕。在解放区里面，日本战犯不仅没有当“联络官”的权利，而且一个也逃不了人民的正义的严惩。
    蒋介石利用日本法西斯残余屠杀中国人民的罪行是无法掩盖的。彭学沛说：“目前中国境内尚有一部分日侨及留用日本技术人员未曾遣完。”这些所谓“未曾遣完”的日人，就是蒋军（如阎锡山军里面所用之日本军人和技术人员）。蒋介石使用日本法西斯残余作为内战工具之计划，是得到他的主子——美帝国主义的批准和支援的。据可靠消息，蒋已经商定以日本军人为蒋军的教练官。因此日本法西斯军官的一个头子——冈村宁次的“留用”和充当“联络官”决不是偶然的。冈村宁次屠杀中国人民的“丰富经验”当然为蒋介石和美帝国主义所十分珍视。
    蒋介石在中国人民的强大民主运动前面，除了依靠美帝国主义的援助以外，还不得不乞怜于日本法西斯残余。这说明蒋介石的统治基础是如何脆弱！冈村宁次等日本战犯是中国抗日军民特别是华北解放区军民手中败军之将，蒋介石企图“留用”这些家伙来对付比较抗日战争时更为强大的人民解放军，决然是无济于事的。而这种毫无民族意识破坏世界和平之措施，必然遭到全中国同胞与全世界正义舆论的一致坚决反对。
    日本法西斯军阀屠杀中国人民的血债必须清偿，著名战犯如冈村宁次之流必须像戈林等一样明正典型，而甘与这些战犯队伍之卖国贼和帝国主义分子，亦必定会有遭到人民裁判之一日。
