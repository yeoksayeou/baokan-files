Our Local Troops Attack the Fengpei Highway
	Annihilating Over 700 Enemy Security Regiment Soldiers
	Jining Local Troops Annihilate Two Companies of Chiang's Army from Northern Jiangsu

[This newspaper's report from the Jilu Yu Front on the 27th] Our local troops on the 24th on the Feng (County) Shan (County) highway annihilated over 700 men, including the commander of the Chiang-controlled Feng County Security Regiment, Liu Wanjun. This is a major victory for the local troops behind enemy lines in the Jilu Yu area, once again proving that Chiang's army reserves are empty and have fallen into a passive, beaten position. On the morning of the 24th, Liu Wanjun led his troops from Daliu Village (40 li west of Cao County) to invade westward. Our local troops met them head-on and blocked them. At the same time, the main force detoured to the rear of the enemy to attack from both sides. After three hours of fierce fighting, they were completely annihilated. It is estimated that over 100 people including commander Liu Wanjun were killed, over 500 were captured including battalion commanders, three mortars, five heavy machine guns, 35 American-made light machine guns, over 400 rifles, and one radio station were seized. Liu Wanjun formerly served as the Deputy Commander of the 40th Division of the 25th Army of the Sichuan Army, and is now the commander of the Chiang-controlled Feng County Security Regiment. The regiment is equipped by the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, and its weapons are very complete, and it also has some American equipment, and its combat effectiveness is quite strong, but under the attack of our powerful people's armed forces, it finally perished. Now in the vast area between Yutai, Jinxiang, Chengwu, Shanxian, Dangshan, Fengxian, and Peixian on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong, our people's armed forces are developing rapidly and will gradually recover all lost territories from the hands of the Chiang and puppet forces.

[This newspaper's report from the Jilu Yu Front on the 27th] Following the victory of our local troops annihilating more than 200 enemies at Dawangji between the Ding (Tao) and Cao (County) highways on the 21st, on the 22nd, our local troops also annihilated one puppet district office at Zhongxingji (40 li west of Fengxian), and another unit annihilated two puppet district offices at Zhengqiao on the Shan (County) and Cheng (Wu) highways and at a certain place on the Yu (Tai) and Shan (County) highways, capturing more than 100 people and weapons.

[This newspaper's report] The Jinji Luyu Military Region recently issued a circular commending the local troops and units behind enemy lines in the Jinji Luyu area. (1) On the 11th, the Jining local troops and the "Yu Jin" detachment annihilated two companies of Chiang's local troops from northern Jiangsu at Xingfuji north of Jinxiang County, capturing more than 100 enemies and seizing more than 100 rifles. The platoon leader Li Xiu refused to leave the line of fire despite minor injuries, and captured more than 30 enemies alone. The health squad leader XX, while rescuing on the front line, also killed three enemies. (2) The Puyang Second District District Cadre Team, under the leadership of District Party Secretary Xu Zhiyao, killed the puppet Self-Defense Regiment Commander Su Qiwu and captured 19 people, seizing 18 rifles at Qiliuzhai, Puyang on the evening of the 10th. (3) On the 10th and 11th evenings, a unit of the Puyang Brigade defeated the enemy conscription team, capturing three people and three weapons each. On the 11th, another unit of the brigade intercepted the puppet district team grabbing conscripts, capturing two people including the district captain, and seizing two rifles. (4) The local troops of the Fourth Military District cut the wires between Liangmen and Dasangshu in Puyang on the 13th. The next morning, more than 400 enemies attacked from Liangmen and were defeated by us at Baiqiu, killing and wounding more than 130 enemies. The above-mentioned local troops behind enemy lines actively attacked the enemy and achieved brilliant victories at a small cost. The military region specially issued a circular to commend them.
