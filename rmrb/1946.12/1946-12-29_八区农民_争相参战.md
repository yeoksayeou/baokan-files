　　Farmers in the Eighth District
    Compete to Enlist
    [Further News] More than 400 liberated masses from the Eighth District of the county, along with more than 50 stretchers, are vying to go to the front lines to join the war. Two old men, because of their older age, were not called upon. They immediately questioned, saying, "Why aren't the two of us being called? No, we are determined to go to the front lines. If we don't repay the Communist Party's kindness now, when will we ever?" Everyone was deeply moved upon hearing this and unanimously swore, "We will repay the kindness without fear of death, resolutely go to the front lines, and carry back the wounded brothers." After eating, they immediately rushed to the Jilu豫 front lines for days. When they returned, they traveled for a day and a half, eating only two meals, and their feet were covered in blisters, but everyone's morale was high. They said, "When our feet are better, we will go again. We will cooperate with our troops and defeat old Chiang in one go!"

　　八区农民
    争相参战
    【又讯】该县八区翻身群众四百余人，五十余付担架，争着上前线参战。二位老汉因年岁稍大未叫去，他俩当场提出质问说：“为什么不叫俺二人去，不行，我们坚决上前线，这时不报共产党的恩，啥时候才报呀！”大家听了，深受感动，一致宣誓说：“咱们要报恩不怕死，坚决上火线，把负伤的弟兄们抬回来。”饭后即连日奔赴冀鲁豫前线。回来时走了一天半，吃了两顿饭，脚上全打了泡，但大家情绪很高涨，他们说：“脚好了还得去，咱们配合咱的队伍，一股劲将老蒋干下去！”
