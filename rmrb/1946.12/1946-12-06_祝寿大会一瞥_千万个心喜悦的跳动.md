　　A Glimpse of the Birthday Celebration
  　Millions of Hearts Beat with Joy
    Tang Ximin
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After breakfast on November 3rd, with a joyful mood, I took the birthday gift from our newspaper and headed towards the celebration venue over the mountain.

    I climbed the hilltop, and streams of people coming to offer birthday wishes poured in from all directions. In the gullies, on the slopes, by the streams, and on the dry riverbeds, drums were beating bright and joyous melodies, and the bright red flags shone with the golden characters "Celebrating Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Sixtieth Birthday."  The crowd constantly burst into soaring songs.

    I caught up and, along with a group of people celebrating the birthday, entered the venue. At the front of this group, under the red flag, was a huge colorful portrait of Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Behind it, they carried the birthday gift they were presenting.  The streets were lined with people. As we passed by, a child in new clothes was playing at the door with his head down. He suddenly stood up, grabbed the sleeve of a middle-aged woman standing next to him, and pointed at the portrait of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, exclaiming happily, "Mom! Look, isn't that Commander-in-Chief Zhu?"  From the joy shining in his eyes, I saw his respect and affection for Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

    Many women came from more than ten miles away to participate, dressed neatly as if for a festive occasion, with snow-white towels covering their heads. Several women hurried past me, holding red paper flags with slogans like "Having Overturned Our Lives, Uprooted Poverty, Commander-in-Chief Zhu is Our Great Benefactor," and "Celebrating Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Birthday, We Must Follow Him Forever." They were whispering happily, "Who are you bringing to pay respects to Commander-in-Chief Zhu?" "I made a pair of cotton shoes for our comrades," a young girl replied with a smile. She paused slightly and then asked the young woman who had asked the question, "What about you?" "This morning, I asked someone to write a letter to my child's father, telling him not to worry about home and to fight well!"

    On the edge of the field east of the venue, rows of militiamen were seated. Six years ago, when I celebrated Commander-in-Chief Zhu's birthday on the banks of the Qingzhang River, I also saw such ranks; however, at that time, most of the militiamen were carrying broadswords and red-tasseled spears. Now, most of those heroes have joined the People's Liberation Army and become steel-like, strong warriors. And these new militiamen have become even stronger through training. The weapons they hold are no longer the crude, primitive weapons of the past, but have been completely replaced with brand-new rifles, including Type 38 rifles and grenade launchers seized from the Japanese invaders, but more often, Czech-style light machine guns and rifles and small cannons made by the Kuomintang military factories, sent by Chiang Kai-shek.

    The 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army also came from afar to offer birthday wishes. These heroes marched into the venue, carrying the weapons that Chiang Kai-shek had given them in the past to attack the liberated areas, now to celebrate the birthday of Zhu, Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army. General Kong Congzhou said, "We cannot use Chiang Kai-shek's tools of civil war to slaughter our own compatriots. We must, under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, fight alongside the Eighth Route Army and strive for the complete realization of China's democratic peace." His words represent not only the will of every soldier in the 38th Army, but also the belief of every officer and soldier in Chiang Kai-shek's army who opposes selling out the country and opposing civil war.

    This is not an ordinary gathering; it is a sign of the determination of the soldiers and civilians of the entire liberated area to fight to the end following Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and it is a demonstration against the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. When the birthday gifts were presented in front of the portrait of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, magnificent shouts erupted from every corner of the venue. The peasants who had been liberated shouted: "Celebrating Commander-in-Chief Zhu's sixtieth birthday, we must do all war support work and support the front lines." The militiamen shouted: "Intensify military training, consolidate the rear, and actively cooperate with the army in combat." In the ranks of the soldiers, they shouted: "Annihilate seventeen more brigades of the Chiang army, and completely smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." As people left the venue, I heard soaring songs from the magnificent ranks: "General Zhu De is good at using troops,...loves the people like children, loves the Party like parents, everyone says he is a towering hero."

    Millions of hearts are beating with joy!

　　祝寿大会一瞥
  　千万个心喜悦的跳动
    唐西民
    【本报特写】十一月三日早饭后，我怀着愉悦的心情，带着本社敬送的寿礼，向山那边祝寿的会场走去。
    我爬上了山头，一队队祝寿的人群从四面八方涌来，山沟里、山坡上、小河边和干涸的河滩上，到处是锣鼓敲打着嘹亮而欢乐的曲调，鲜红的旗帜上闪耀着“庆祝朱总司令六秩大寿”的金黄大字。人群里不断的传来高昂的歌声。
    我赶了上去，随着一队祝寿的群众，走进了会场。在这队人群的前边，红旗下面是一帧朱总司令的巨幅五彩画像，后面抬着的是他们送的寿礼。街道两侧挤满了人，当我们走过的时候，一个穿新衣裳的孩子，正低着头在门口玩耍，他突然站了起来，一手扯着站在他旁边的一个中年妇女的衣襟，一手指着朱总司令的画像，高兴地嚷叫起来：“妈！你看，这不是朱总司令么？”从他闪烁着喜悦的眼神里，我看出了他对朱总司令是充满了尊敬和亲热。
    许多妇女从十多里地以外赶来参加，他们象过喜事一样，穿的整整齐齐，头上罩着雪白的毛巾。有几个妇女从我的身边匆匆地走过，她们手里拿着红色的纸旗，上面写着“翻了身，拔穷根，朱总司令是咱大恩人”“给朱总司令祝寿，要永远跟着他走”等字样。她们在愉快地低语：“你拿谁来给朱总司令拜寿呢？”“我给咱同志们做了一双棉鞋”一个年青的姑娘微笑地回答说。她稍停了一停，就向那个发问的年青媳妇反问了一句：“你呢？”“我今早请人给孩子他爹写了一封信，叫他不要挂念家里，好好的打仗哩！”
    在会场东边的地畔上，坐满了一排一排的民兵，六年前，在清漳河畔给朱总司令祝寿时，我也曾看见过这样的行列；但是，那时候民兵们大半是扛着大刀和红缨枪。现在，当年的这批英雄们多已参加了解放军，变成了钢铁般坚强的战士。而这些新生的民兵们，也锻炼的愈加强大，他们手拿的已不是当年拙劣的原始武器，完全换成了崭新的步枪，有从日寇手里缴来了三八式步枪和掷弹筒，但更多的是蒋军送来的捷克式轻机枪和军委会兵工厂所造的长枪和小炮。
    西北民主联军三十八军也从远道赶来祝寿，他们雄纠纠地跑步进入会场。这些英雄们携带着蒋介石过去的发给他们进攻解放区的武器，来给人民解放军领袖朱总司令祝寿了。孔从周将军说：“我们不能用蒋介石的内战工具来残杀自己的同胞。我们要在朱总司令的领导下，和八路军并肩作战，争取全中国民主和平的彻底实现。”他的话不仅代表了三十八军每一个战士的意志，也是蒋介石军队里每一个反对卖国、反对内战的官兵的信念。
    这不是平凡的集会，这是全解放区军民决心跟着毛主席朱总司令战斗到底的标记，是对蒋介石反动派的示威。当寿礼捧到朱总司令画像前面时，会场每个角落都发出雄壮的叫声，翻身农民们喊：“庆祝朱总司令六十大寿，要做好一切战勤工作，支援前线。”民兵们嚷：“加紧练武，巩固后方，积极配合军队作战。”在战士群里则高呼：“再消灭蒋军十七个旅，彻底粉碎蒋介石的进攻。”在人们离开会场时，我听见雄壮的行列里传出嘹亮的歌声：“朱德将军善用兵，……爱民如子女、爱党如爹娘，那一个不说他是顶天立地的英雄将。”
    千万颗心喜悦的在跳动！
