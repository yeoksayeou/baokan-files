[This newspaper] reports: In Guanzhuang, Fourth District of Shahe, a Guomintang special agent "Love the Village Corps" organization was smashed. The feudal forces in this village have always been stubbornly entrenched, thus providing convenient opportunities for the "Love the Village Corps" to operate. After two comrades from a land reform work team of the Military and Political University arrived in the village, they discovered the Jiang special agent organization. The special agents spread rumors saying: The land reform team will take away the good things from the fruits of the masses' struggle, taking thirty percent; the land reform team is a special agent team, and they threatened the masses not to speak out about their grievances. After careful investigation and research, on November 11th, the special agent organization was smashed, and all the key members, including Zhang Xingwu and more than ten others, were arrested. The case is currently being processed. Since the "Love the Village Corps" special agent organization was smashed, the mass movement in the village has greatly accelerated. The masses have been discussing: "No wonder we couldn't turn things around; it turns out the special agents were sabotaging us!" (Zhang Junru, Ren Wenshan)

[This newspaper] reports: On the 21st of last month, more than two thousand citizens of Handan gathered at the Public Sports Field for a public trial of Guomintang special agent Han Jingming and others. Special Agent Han is 31 years old, from Daming, and has been raised by the Guomintang special agent agency for many years. In July of this year, after being appointed as the head of a branch of the "Iron-Blood National Salvation Corps" by the Guomintang special agent agency in Shijiazhuang, he successively sneaked into Handan and other areas to establish "Iron-Blood" organizations, specifically recruiting landlords who had been liquidated, hooligans, local bullies, and individual bad cadres to participate. Their specific tasks were: to deceive the people in our area, to flee to the Guomintang area, to create rumors and cause trouble, to undermine the mass movement, to organize assassinations, and to disrupt public security, in order to cooperate with the Guomintang army's offensive against our Ping-Han Railway line. In Handan alone, Special Agent Han used fellow villagers from Daming who had fled to Handan due to the famine to organize dozens of people into the "Iron-Blood Corps," trying every possible means to gather intelligence about our side. Li Enbo (from Daming), the former deputy director of the farmers' association in Jiaoyao Street, joined the "Iron-Blood Corps" after being exposed. In his confession, Li said: "Han Jingming's task for me was to spread rumors, scout out military intelligence, and assassinate militia cadres in peacetime. When the die-hard bandits came, we would rise up as internal responders and run over there (referring to the Guomintang side). Han reported to Shijiazhuang on several occasions and received special agent funds of 32,000 Jichaos and 44,000 in legal currency." All of the above has been fully confessed by the Jiang special agent. The masses, considering Han Jingming's unwavering commitment to being an enemy of the people, demanded that he be executed with the utmost severity. The government accepted the demands of the masses and executed the traitor Han by firing squad on the spot. (Cui Biyun)
