　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 16th dispatch】 "Night Pearl," a famous militia combat hero from Southern Shanxi, and others eliminated 400 enemies in a week, achieving one-half of the total task of eliminating 800 enemies in the whole region proposed by the Taiyue Military Commission General Association for "Defending Yan'an and Defending Chairman Mao," exceeding the Fourth Military Sub-district's task of killing enemies by more than double. At the beginning of this month, during the battle in Southern Shanxi where our army liberated Yuanqu City, "Night Pearl" Comrade Li Yinbao and more than 1,000 militiamen from the six counties of Yangcheng, Jincheng, Yuanqu, Wangwu, Gaoping, and Shimin in the Fourth Military Sub-district cooperated with the main force in the battle. The "Night Pearl" guerrilla team and a certain unit first besieged the enemy stronghold of Songjiazhuang. After threatening them with firepower and appealing to them verbally, a platoon of more than 40 men from the invading army's 163rd Regiment collectively surrendered, bringing with them one American-made machine gun and five rifles. The 2nd Company of the militia rotation team captured three enemies below the district chief level in the battle of besieging Dashan Temple. The Yuanqu militia captured all 367 people, including the battalion commander of the Chiang army's 163rd Regiment, Wu Yuquan, and the deputy head of the "Love the Homeland Corps," Du Zaigong. The Wangwu militia captured more than 10 enemies below the level of quartermaster and more than 100 members of the "Land Reform Revenge Squad." The Jiyuan militia eliminated more than 10 enemies in this battle and captured and won over seven enemies. On the 6th, more than 100 Chiang soldiers who broke through and fled from Yuanqu tried to escape across the river by boat, but were severely attacked by a squad of river defense militiamen from Wangwu, sinking one enemy boat and burying more than 60 Chiang soldiers in the belly of the fish. In total, within a week, the "Night Pearl" and other militia guerrilla teams independently killed and captured 500 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet soldiers, seized three American-made machine guns, 41 rifles, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 50 coats and cotton-padded clothes, and more than 10 cattle and mules, greatly exceeding the original task of killing 200 enemies assigned to the entire Fourth Military Sub-district.
