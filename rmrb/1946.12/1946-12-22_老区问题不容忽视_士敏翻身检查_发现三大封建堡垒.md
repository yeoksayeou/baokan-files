　　The Old Liberated Areas' Problems Cannot Be Ignored
    Shi Min's Review of Land Reform
    Uncovers Three Major Feudal Fortresses
    [This newspaper's Taiyue 20th dispatch] In Shi Min County's comprehensive review of land reform, three major feudal fortresses were discovered. Although four years of land reform struggles had passed, feudal forces still held a dominant position in the three villages of Guo Bi, Dou Zhuang, and Duan Shi. Wang Yuan of Guo Bi, Jia Lude of Duan Shi, and Zhang Xichang of Dou Zhuang had faced joint struggles from various villages several times, but their feudal exploitation was never eliminated. This time, in the comprehensive review of land reform to realize "land to the tiller," the masses' concepts of "conscience," "fate," and "sentiment" were finally broken, and new struggles have begun. Liu Guifu of Dou Zhuang revealed a grievance hidden in his heart for several years, telling everyone, "I borrowed twelve yuan from Jurunyuan. Unable to pay the interest, they seized my good acre of land, and it has been six years now. I have been ruled by 'conscience' and haven't spoken out. Now, seeing others eating well and becoming fat, while my family still suffers from hunger and cold, what good is 'conscience'?" Liang Lulu of Duan Shi worked as a servant for Jia Lude his whole life, suffering exploitation and oppression. Last year, he proposed settling accounts several times, but the farmers' association believed that there were no documents and no basis for calculation, so he has not yet been liberated.

　　老区问题不容忽视
    士敏翻身检查
    发现三大封建堡垒
    【本报太岳廿日电】士敏全县翻身大检查中，发现了三个封建大堡垒，虽然经过四年的翻身斗争，但郭必、窦庄、端氏三个村子封建势力仍占统治地位。郭必的王元、端氏的贾路德、窦庄的张喜昌，曾经各村联合斗争数次，但始终未消灭其封建剥削，此次在实现耕者有其田的翻身大检查中，终于打破了群众“良心”、“命运”、“情面”等观念，又开始了新的斗争。窦庄的刘贵富，掏出了藏在心里几年的苦事向大家说：“我借了聚润元十二元钱，无力上利，将我一亩好地夺去，至今已经六年了，一直被‘良心’统治着没有说出，现在看见人家吃的肥胖，我一家仍然受饥寒，‘良心’顶什么用？端氏梁陆陆给贾路德当了一辈用人，备受剥削欺压，去年数次提出算账，农会认为没有文书，无根据不能算，直至现在仍未翻身。
