　　Wallace Praises Disarmament Proposal
    Advocates Handing Atomic Bombs to International Court
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 20th: According to a United Press dispatch from New York on December 18th: "The New Republic" magazine published an editorial written by Wallace stating, "The Soviet Union is tough in negotiations, but she often makes concessions. Since the Soviet Union compromises with us, why can't we do more than compromise? Therefore, we should stop manufacturing atomic bombs and hand the already manufactured atomic bombs over to the International Court. Thus, atomic bombs should not appear on American soil before the disarmament resolution becomes practically effective. The United Nations' resolution on disarmament is one of the most important pieces of legislation in all of history."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 20th: According to Moscow Radio: American journalist Shou Song issued a statement severely criticizing the United States for conducting the "Iron Curtain" propaganda fabricated by Churchill. Shou Song stated: American journalists have requested to travel to the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, and permission has been granted each time. He has traveled to the Soviet-occupied zone five times and enjoyed all rights of freedom of movement.

　　华莱士赞扬裁军案
    主张把原子弹交给国际法庭
    【新华社延安二十日电】据合众社纽约十八日电：《新共和》周刊发表华莱士写的社论称：“苏联对谈判是强硬的，但她经常让步，苏联既和我们妥协，我们为何不能做得比妥协更多些呢？因此我们应该不再制造原子弹，并把已经造好的原子弹交给国际法庭，这样在裁军决议发生实际效力之前，原子弹在美国领土上不应该出现。联合国对裁减军备的决议，是全部历史上最主要的法案之一。”
    【新华社延安二十日电】据莫斯科广播：美记者寿松发表声明，严厉指责美国进行邱吉尔所捏造之“铁幕”宣传。寿松称：美记者要求游历德境苏占领区，每次均获允准，他曾五次游历苏占领区，享有一切来往自由之权利。
