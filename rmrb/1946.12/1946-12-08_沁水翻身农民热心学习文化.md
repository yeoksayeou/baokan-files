　　Taiyue News Agency, 6th. After the rent reduction and interest rate reduction in the second district of Qinshui, the policy of "land to the tillers" was thoroughly realized. People's lives improved, and there was an urgent need for cultural learning. They not only sent their children to school, but every young adult and even older people hoped to learn to read. Xiwa, a cattle-herding child from Shangwoquan Village, asked the village school teacher to spare time in the evenings to teach him a few characters. In response to the people's requests, the district office specially sent someone to transport a large number of books from the city to the countryside (such as the "Turning Over" Four-Character Classic, etc.). Whenever they arrived in a village, the people rushed to buy them. Fourty thousand copies were sold in just three days. Based on the people's enthusiasm for learning, the district office has set a plan to eliminate illiteracy this winter, with full illiterates learning 100 to 300 characters, and semi-illiterates learning more than 400 characters, so that they can generally understand newspapers and write simple letters.
    【Taiyue News Agency, 4th.】Since this spring, primary school education in various parts of the district has gradually shifted from public to private management. At the beginning, there were no funds for office expenses, so the schools engaged in production to solve the problem. The second-level primary schools in Jincheng County have already achieved self-sufficiency in expenses through production in the past ten months. In the ten months, the total income from agricultural and sideline production of all teachers and students was more than 180,000 yuan, and the schools and students shared the profits in a ratio of 70% public and 30% private. The schools can be self-sufficient, and a few students can also be partially self-sufficient. For example, Li Wenbin, a production model, can use his dividends to cover his vegetable expenses.

　　沁水翻身农民热心学习文化
    【本报太岳六日电】沁水二区查减后，彻底实现了“耕者有其田”，群众生活上升，迫切需要文化学习。他们不仅送子女入学，而且每个青壮年或老年亦希望认字。上沃泉村放牛孩喜娃，请求村里小学教员晚上抽暇教他几个字。区署应群众之请，特抽一人从城里担贩大批书籍下乡（如翻身四字经等），每到一村，群众争先恐后的购买。三天即出售四万本。区署根据群众学习的情绪，订出今冬消灭文盲的计划，全文盲认字一百到三百，半文盲认字四百以上，使其普遍能看懂报，写简单的信。
    【本报太岳四日电】今春以来，全区各地小学教育，陆续由公办转入民办，开始办公费无着，学校便从事生产解决。晋城县第二两级小学，已在今年十个月的生产中，达到了费用的自给。十个月中全体师生的农业与副业生产，共收入洋十八万余元，学校与学生按公七私三分红，学校可以自给，少数学生亦能部份自给。如生产模范李文斌，分红可自给菜金。
