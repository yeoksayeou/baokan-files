　　Taiyue, December 25th (From Our Newspaper) Jiexiu Shangliang Village began investigation and rent reduction in November of last year. Now, it has thoroughly realized "land to the tiller," and feudal forces have been completely eliminated economically and politically. Before the 34th year of the Republic of China, the villagers had implemented several rent and interest reduction movements. However, because the village administration was still controlled by feudal forces, many landlords and feudal rich peasants were still secretly not reducing rent, despite outwardly doing so. The secret societies and secret religions organized by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents were still wantonly active, hindering the mass movement for liberation. After a year of careful investigation and eradication, more than 20 landlords, local tyrants, and feudal rich peasants were re-struggled against and purged. The secret societies were also overthrown, and more than 1,000 mu of land, more than 100 houses, 5 donkeys, and more than 500 shi of grain were recovered. Currently, each person in the village owns an average of 2 to 3 mu of land.

　　介休上梁村完成土地改革
    【本报太岳二十五日电】介休上梁村，自去年十一月开始查减，现已彻底实现了耕者有其田，封建势力已从经济上与政治上完全消灭。该村民国三十四年以前，已实行过数次减租减息运动，但因村政权仍被封建势力掌握，很多地主及封建富农仍是明减暗不减，蒋特所组织的会门与秘密教，则依然肆意活动，阻碍了群众的翻身运动，经一年的细密查灭后，重新斗争清算了二十余家地主恶霸与封建富农，并将会门斗垮，收回土地一千余亩，房屋一百余间，驴五头，粮食五百余石，现全村每人平均土地二亩至三亩。
