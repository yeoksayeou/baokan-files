　　Unleash a New Upsurge of National Salvation Movement
　　Guang Weiran
　　December 9th is the great festival of China's youth patriotic movement. It feels incredibly exciting to be able to spend this festival in the liberated areas, where the patriotic movement of the masses is surging.
　　In every revolutionary event of the past century, China's young intellectuals have played a significant role. This role of enlightening the early adopters reached a brilliant expression in the December 9th Movement ten years ago. The more progressive aspect of the December 9th Movement compared to the May Fourth Movement lies in the fact that the young intellectuals of the December 9th era already understood how to combine their movement with the people, especially with the workers and peasants; they understood how to mobilize and organize the masses. This grasped the key to victory, igniting a prairie fire of this great patriotic movement throughout the country and defining the historical situation of the subsequent eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan.
　　Progressive and enlightened young intellectuals remain a force to be proud of in the Chinese revolutionary movement today. However, the strength of intellectuals, only when combined with the strength of the people, is substantial, infinite, and can achieve inevitable victory. This is a lesson we have thoroughly learned from the December 9th Movement.
　　Today, coming from the KMT-controlled areas, which sell out the country and oppress the people, to the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area, which belongs to the patriotic people, I have an even deeper understanding of the historical impact of the December 9th Movement. This is not only because the patriotism of that time and the line of combining with the masses have been highly developed in the liberated areas, but also because many of the heroes of the December 9th era have supported and led the eight-year anti-Japanese guerrilla war in this region, created the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area that includes 30 million people, and ensured the victory of today's patriotic self-defense war. As far as I know, our border region's glorious leader, Comrade Yang Xiufeng, was an important organizer and leader in the December 9th Movement ten years ago. The spirit of the December 9th Movement is best embodied and brought to light in them.
　　From the two major events of the December 9th Movement and the Xi'an Incident, the Chinese people have long seen clearly the true face of Chiang Kai-shek, the enemy of the people. Even ten years ago, during the period of severe national crisis, Chiang Kai-shek was willing to sell out the country and unwilling to resist Japan, so that the young students in Beiping who called for resistance against the enemy and national salvation suffered the abuse of broadswords and water cannons. Later, he was forced by the people to declare resistance, but in reality, he still pursued a line of compromise and defeat, continued to collude with the enemy, continued to abuse the people, and lightly pushed the heavy burden of resisting the enemy and puppets onto the shoulders of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, attempting to crush them. When Japan surrendered, he shamelessly wanted to monopolize the fruits of the War of Resistance and intensified the implementation of the policy of betraying the country and oppressing the people, even daring to carry out an open large-scale civil war, intending to push the suffering people into the eighteenth level of hell. Therefore, now that a new and more serious national crisis is at hand, and a new period of national salvation movement has arrived, the patriotic spirit of December 9th must be developed to a higher degree. The kind and brave Chinese people, workers, peasants, and soldiers, and intellectuals across the country must not allow the traitor, the country-selling bandit, and the butcher Chiang Kai-shek and his followers to continue to slaughter the fate of 450 million people. The goal of the December 9th struggle is still the goal of today's struggle, and the unfinished task of the December 9th must be completed in this new national salvation movement of ours!

　　掀起新的救亡运动的高潮
    光未然
    一二、九是我国青年爱国运动的伟大节日。想到今年竟能在群众的爱国运动汹涌澎湃的解放区来度过这个节日，真感觉无比的兴奋。
    我国的青年知识分子们，在近百年来的每一次革命事变中，都起着相当重要的作用。这种先觉的启迪的作用，在十年前的运动的一九二、中，尤其达到辉煌的表现。一二、九运动比五四运动更进步的地方，就在于一二、九时代的知识青年们，已经懂得了如何把自己的运动和人民结合，尤其和工农群众结合，懂得了如何去鼓动群众和组织群众；这就掌握了胜利的锁钥，而使这个爱国的大运动在全国范围内烧起了燎原之火，规定了以后八年抗日战争的历史形势。
    进步的，先觉的青年知识分子们，直到今天，还是中国革命运动中值得夸耀的力量。但是，知识分子的力量，只有和人民的力量结合起来以后，才是雄厚的，无穷的，才能取得必然的胜利。这是我们从一二、九运动中切实领会的教训。
    今天，我从卖国虐民的蒋管区来到爱国的人民自己的晋冀鲁豫解放区，对于一二、九运动的历史影响，领会得更加深切。这不仅由于当年的爱国主义以及和群众结合的路线，在解放区得到高度的发扬，且因为一二、九时代的健儿们，有许许多多都在这个区域中支持了和领导了八年的抗日游击战争，创造了包括三千万人民的晋冀鲁豫解放区，并保证了今天的爱国自卫战争的胜利。就我所知，我们边区的光荣领袖如杨秀峰同志，便是十年前的一二、九运动中的重要组织者和领导者，在他们的身上，一二、九的精神得到最高的体现和发扬光大。
    从一二、九运动和西安事变这两件大事中，中国老百姓早已清清楚楚看出了人民公敌蒋介石的真面目。这在十年前国难严重的时期，蒋介石就甘心卖国，不愿抗战，以致呼吁抗敌救亡的北平青年学生饱受大刀和水龙头的虐杀。后来总算是被人民强迫着宣布抗战了，实际上还是执行着妥协的败北的路线，继续和敌人勾搭，继续虐杀人民，把抗击敌伪的重担轻轻了了地推到共产党和八路军的肩头，企图借此把他们压死。等到日本投降了，他却要无耻地独占抗战的果实，并且变本加厉地执行卖国虐民的政策，甚至敢于进行公开的大规模的内战，打算把苦难深重的老百姓推到十八层地狱中去。所以，事到如今，又是新的更严重的国难当前了，又临到一个新的救亡运动的时期了，一二、九的爱国精神必定要得到更高度的发扬，善良而勇敢的中国老百姓，工农和士兵们，全国的知识分子们，一定不能再让那个汉奸卖国贼流氓刽子手蒋介石及其党羽继续宰割着四万万五千万人的命运。一二、九斗争的目标仍然是今天斗争的目标，一二、九未完成的任务，一定要在我们这一次新的救亡运动得到完成！
