　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 5th: Today is the tenth anniversary of the Stalin Constitution. Moscow Radio broadcast an article by the famous political commentator Zaslavsky, which stated: "Ten years ago, when Stalin made a report on the draft of the new constitution at the Eighth Congress of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, he talked about several criticisms of the new Soviet constitution by the bourgeoisie: The first type was the bourgeois reactionaries, who feigned deafness and deliberately despised the Soviet Union and its new constitution. These governments included Switzerland and several countries in South America. At that time, Stalin said that this method of criticism was stupid and ridiculous. Now, what is left of this kind of criticism? Nothing at all. Not long ago, we saw many people vying to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The second type of critic was the German fascists, who said at the time that the Soviet constitution had no meaning because the Soviet Union was not a country, but a geographical concept. These critics even surveyed the geography of the Soviet Union, from the Dnieper River to Stalingrad, but many people did not survive from there. These critics were crushed like fascist Germany. The third type of critic was the bourgeois skeptics, who predicted that the Soviet socialist constitution would fail, and during the war, they also doubted that the Soviet Union would fail. What is left of these criticisms? The Soviet Union has given Hitler's Germany a crushing blow, and the Soviet Union itself has become stronger after World War II. Nothing is left of this kind of criticism. The fourth type of critic believed that the new Soviet constitution represented a rightward shift in the Soviet Union. Facts have proved how naive and ridiculous this criticism is. Stalin ridiculed these people at the time for not even being able to distinguish between left and right. The fifth type of critic attacked the new Soviet constitution as undemocratic, accusing the constitution of preserving the leading role of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union. Stalin replied to this criticism at the time that there was no basis for more than two parties to exist in our Soviet Union because there were no mutually hostile classes in the Soviet Union. These critics are still saying that the Soviet Union is undemocratic because the Soviet Union is still a one-party system, namely the Communist Party. But what has the history of the past ten years proven? When the Stalin Constitution was passed ten years ago, there were many different kinds of political parties in capitalist countries. Before the war, the Conservative Party was in power in Britain, the Laval and Daladier parties were in power in France, and the Democratic Party led by Roosevelt was in power in the United States. What happened after the war? Chamberlain and Churchill's Conservative Party suffered a shameful downfall; in France, the people strangled Laval after the war and cursed his party as utterly bad; in the United States, the Democratic Party suffered a defeat after Roosevelt's death. In these ten years, almost no bourgeois country has retained a political party that held a leading position before the war, only the Soviet Union still has the same party, namely the Communist Party, in a leading position. During the post-war elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the people, as before the war, unanimously voted in favor of the Communist Party. What value is there in the reactionary critics shouting that the Soviet Union is undemocratic? There is no value at all. Ten years ago, Comrade Stalin said that the Soviet Constitution is the only thoroughly democratic constitution in the world. Historical facts have proved this point and proved that it is the cornerstone of world peace and democracy."

　　世界和平民主的柱石
  　苏政论家论斯大林宪法
    【新华社延安五日电】今日是斯大林宪法十周年纪念日，莫斯科广播发表名政论家萨斯拉夫斯基一文，略称：“十年以前，斯大林在苏联全区最高苏维埃第八次代表大会上作关于新宪法草案的报告时，谈到资产阶级对苏联新宪法的几种批评：第一种是资产阶级反动派，他们装聋作哑故意蔑视苏联及其新宪法。这些政府如瑞士及南美的几个国家。当时斯大林说，这种批评方式是愚蠢可笑的，现在这种批评还剩下些什么呢，什么也未剩下。我们不久前还看到许多人争先恐后地请求与苏联建立邦交。第二种批评家是德国法西斯，他们当时说苏联宪法没有任何意义，因为苏联似乎不是一个国家，而是一个地理概念。这种批评家甚至勘察了苏联的地理，从德涅泊河到斯大林格勒，可是许多人从那里未得生还。这种批评家和法西斯德国一样被粉碎了。第三种批评家是资产阶级的怀疑派，他们预言苏联社会主义宪法会失败，战争时期也曾怀疑苏联要失败。这些批评剩下什么呢，苏联已给希特勒德国以粉碎的打击，苏联自己经过二次大战则更加强固了。这类批评什么也未剩下。第四种批评家认为苏联新宪法表示苏联向右转，事实已证明了这种批评是如何幼稚可笑。斯大林当时即嘲笑这些人连左右都分不清楚。第五种批评家攻击苏联新宪法似乎是不民主的，责备宪法保存共产党在苏联的领导作用。斯大林当时回答这种批评说，在我们苏联没有两个党以上存在的基础，因为苏联没有彼此敌对的阶级。这种批评家现在还在继续说苏联不民主，因为苏联至今还是一个党即共产党。可是十年来的历史证明了什么呢，当十年前斯大林宪法通过时，资本主义国家里存在着许多各种各样的政党，战前在英国是保守党当政，法国是赖伐尔、达拉第的党当政，美国是罗斯福为首的民主党当政。经过战争后怎样呢，张伯伦邱吉尔的保守党遭到可耻的下台；在法国，战后人民绞杀了赖伐尔，骂他的党是坏透了的党；在美国罗斯福死后民主党遭到失败。这十年内无论那个资产阶级国家差不多没剩下一个在战前占领导地位的政党，只有苏联还是那一个党即共产党占领导地位。战后苏最高苏维埃选举时，人民与战前一样，一致投票赞成共产党。反动派批评家叫喊苏联不民主有什么价值呢，什么价值也没有。十年前斯大林同志说，苏联宪法是世界上唯一彻底民主的宪法。历史事实证明了这一点，并且证明它是世界和平民主的柱石。
