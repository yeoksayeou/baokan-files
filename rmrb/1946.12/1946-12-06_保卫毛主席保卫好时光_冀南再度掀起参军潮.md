　　Defend Chairman Mao, Defend the Good Times
    A New Wave of Joining the Army Sweeps Through Southern Hebei
    [Reported by this newspaper] Upon hearing that Chiang Kai-shek's troops were attempting to attack Yan'an, the masses in the Third District of Southern Hebei experienced another surge of enthusiasm for joining the army. In mid-November, Yongnian, Handan, and Cheng'an counties alone saw 1,140 heroes and good men gather in the district within fifteen days. Many villages sent entire rows and platoons of recruits. In Shizhuang, Yongnian, where the land issue had only just been resolved, as soon as people heard about defending Yan'an, 31 young men immediately joined the army with the militia captain, Shan Benyi. Before leaving, Captain Shan's mother instructed him, "Do a good job at the front. Our few acres of land were given to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We can't eat steadily if we don't beat back Old Chiang." Li Guangrong, the militia captain of Yanzhuang, also led twelve militiamen to join the army. At the farewell meeting with the masses, he said, "Only by driving away Chiang Kai-shek can we truly turn ourselves over." The village's farmers' association director, in his forties, insisted on joining the army. The district authorities thought he was too old and wouldn't let him go, so he gave his leather jacket, cotton trousers, and a woolen sweater he had knitted himself to the new soldiers. Hei Ni, an activist in the Shibeikou militia, bravely joined the army, moving his wife to put a red flower on him and send him outside the village. She personally poured him three cups of wine and instructed him, "Don't think about coming home until you've beaten back Old Chiang." His father-in-law also led a horse for several miles. Wang Qin'ai, a retired soldier from Xixiangzi, said upon returning to the battlefield, "I came home before because they said there was peace. Now Old Chiang is rebelling again, so I must go back to the battlefield and give him a good beating." Ma Shichang, the director of the Dingsitou Farmers' Association in Handan, signed up his son for the army at the sub-district representative meeting and then went home and called on eight more young men to join the army. Feng Xiu, a sub-district representative in the Sixth District of Chengci, took the lead, sparking a wave of enlistment throughout the district. When his mother sent him to the district, she told the masses, "Feng Xiu is my only child. But fighting Old Chiang is an important matter, and I am very willing to let him go." (Lu Feng)

    【本报讯】冀南三分区群众听到蒋介石军队企图进攻延安，参军热潮再起。十一月中旬，永年、邯郸、成安三县在十五天中，即有一千一百四十名英雄好汉集中到分区。许多村庄都是整排整班的入伍。永年施庄才初步解决土地问题，一听说保卫延安，立刻有三十一名青年随民兵队长单本意一起参军。单队长临走时，他母亲嘱咐说：“你到前线好好干，咱几亩地是共产党毛主席给的，不打退老蒋咱吃不稳”。燕庄民兵队长李光荣也带领了十二个民兵参军，在群众的欢送会上说：“只有打走蒋介石才能翻透身”。该村农会主任四十几岁了，非要求参军不可，区上嫌他年岁大不让去，他只好把身上穿的皮袄、棉裤和一件自己织成的毛衣都送给了新战士。石北口的民兵积极分子黑尼因奋勇参军，感动得他的老婆给披红戴花，送到村外，还亲自给斟了三盅酒，嘱咐说：“打不退老蒋别想家”。他岳父亦牵着马送了好几里路。西巷子荣退军人王琴爱重上战场时说：“以前说和平了，回了家，现在老蒋又造反了，一定再上战场打他个痛快”。邯郸丁寺头农会主任马世昌，在小区代表会上替儿子报名参军后，回家又号召了八个青年参军。成磁六区小区代表冯秀积极带头，掀起全区参军热潮。他母亲送他到区时，对群众说：“俺就只冯秀一人。可是打老蒋是要紧事，我很愿叫他去”。（路枫）
