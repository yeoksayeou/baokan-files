　　Thriving Market, Developed Financial Business:
    Private Banks in Xingtai City Earn High Profits
    [Report from this newspaper] The market in the liberated areas is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the financial business is developing rapidly. Under the policy of our democratic government to develop private capital and welcome private operation of financial businesses, three new private banks, including Fusun and Yuhua, have been established in Xingtai City. These three banks are all operated by merchants with pooled shares. One is operated jointly by 50 large general merchandise stores in Xingtai City, one is established by the city's top ten paint stores with pooled shares, and the other is jointly established by eight mountain goods stores; each bank has a capital of 2 million Jichaos. With the rapid development of industry and commerce in the liberated areas, the deposit, loan, inland remittance, warehouse operation, and discount businesses of these banks are very developed. According to preliminary statistics from March to July this year, in just five months, the three banks received deposits of 222,167,500 yuan and issued loans of 302,226,700 yuan. Among the loans, 8,085,000 yuan were industrial loans, and the rest were commercial loans. According to preliminary and imprecise calculations, the total net profit for the five months was more than 2,333,300 yuan. The average profit is 38.8% of the capital, with the highest reaching 60.5%. The actual profit is likely even higher. This stands in stark contrast to the financial depression and the closure of private banks in the Jiang-occupied areas. (Pimin)

　　市场繁荣金融业务发达
    邢市民营银号获厚利
    【本报讯】解放区市场日趋繁荣，金融业务发达，邢台市三家民营银号获致厚利。在我民主政府发展私人资本，欢迎私人经营金融业务的政策下，邢台市先后新成立了福顺、裕华等三家银号。这三家银号都是全由商人集股经营的，其中一家是由邢台市五十家大杂货行合股经营，一家由该市十大颜料行集股开办，另一家则由八家山货行合资成立；每个银号各有资本冀钞二百万元。解放区工商业飞跃发展，各该银号的存款、放款、内地汇兑、仓库经营，以及贴现等业务非常发达。仅据今年三月到七月五个月的初步统计：三家银号即收到存款二万万二千一百六十七万五千元；放款三万万零二百二十六万七千元。款中除工业贷款八百零八万五千元外，其余都是商业贷款。五个月的收益，据不精确的初步结算，共获纯利二百三十三万三千余元。平均利润为资金的百分之三八·八，最多的一家更达百分之六十·五，实际利润当更不止此，这与蒋占区金融萧条，民营银行纷纷倒闭，适成一明显的对比。        （匹民）
