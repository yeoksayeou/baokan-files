　　Wives and Mothers Cry Across the Fields
    Chiang's Occupied Xinxiang and Hui County Forcibly Enlist Recruits
    Young Men Secretly Organize Armed Resistance Against Chiang's Atrocities
    [Report from this newspaper in Huixian] Traitor Chiang Kai-shek, in order to save his dwindling sources of soldiers and continue to expand the civil war, is now rampantly conscripting soldiers in his occupied areas of Xinxiang, Hui County, and Huojia. He employs various deceptive schemes: in the name of inspection, he gathers young men together and captures them on the spot. In Wuguanying alone, twelve young men were captured in this way and taken to the puppet township office, where they were imprisoned like criminals, with Chiang's soldiers guarding them even when they ate or relieved themselves. Others were captured under the guise of "meetings." Cao Zengshan, the head of Taocun village, used a "meeting" to capture six people, including middle peasant Cao Songniu and poor peasants Cao Keniu and Wang Hieniu, causing widespread panic and cries of grief. After Fan Xiqing from Wangguanying was captured, his entire family of seven cried for three days, and his sixty-year-old mother nearly died twice from grief. After Ding Li Fengming was captured, his nine-year-old orphan was left behind, crying all day long. Therefore, the young men in Chiang's occupied areas are secretly organizing armed resistance to fight against Chiang's atrocities. (Xu Yun)

    【本报辉县讯】卖国贼蒋介石，为挽救其兵源的枯竭，继续扩大内战，现正在其新（乡）辉（县）获（嘉）侵占区大肆抓丁。施用各种欺骗阴谋：有借检阅为名，将青壮年集合一起，当场捕捉的。五官营即借此抓去壮丁十二名，把他们带到伪乡公所像犯人一样禁闭起来，吃饭、大小便都有蒋军看守。有利用“开会”捕捉的，陶村保长曹增山即借“开会”抓走了中农曹松妞，贫农曹科妞、王恨妞等六人，闹的人心恐惶，哭声遍野。王官营樊希清被抓走后，全家七口，哭了三天，六十多岁的老娘气绝两次。壮丁李凤明被抓后，家里留下一九岁孤儿，成天哭号。因此，蒋占区之青壮年秘密组织武装，开展游击战争，抗拒蒋贼暴行。（徐云）
