    Two or Three Things About Turning Over in Linzhang
    ·Xu Chang·
        Worker
    “Director Jin, you've come all this way, it's really hard on you. You're helping us, the common people, to turn over. We can live a good life from now on! The landlords are willing to voluntarily hand over their land to the masses. Look, this way, without struggle, it's both easier and the people get land. Isn't that great! Also, as the masses are turning over, you should also turn over! When you go home in the future, the travel expenses... hehe... the landlord... a hundred or two hundred thousand for travel expenses won't be a problem, and we'll also give you a plaque..." A poor peasant who used to be a yamen runner said furtively to worker Lao Jin, trying to get close to him.
    Lao Jin turned around and stared at him.
    "Which landlord told you to say this?"
    The man lowered his head and didn't say a word.
    "Don't forget your roots, don't forget you're a poor peasant. Listen to me..." Lao Jin said sternly to him, helping him dig up his roots of poverty.
    The struggle in the village started.
            Liaison Defense Area Captain
    Now, Lao Wang has returned from Handan, his eye disease has been cured. The curses against Lao Wang in Xiaopingying Village have also disappeared.
    A month ago, the village started to struggle. The farmhand Lao Wang took the lead boldly. He worked day and night, his sturdy body getting thinner and thinner, his eyes were red and swollen, and it was difficult to open them.
    "Look, that Wang guy's face has become a line, and his eyes are blind. He really doesn't look like a human anymore!"
    "Whoever kills that Wang kid will get one hundred thousand."
    The landlords and their lackeys were biting everywhere with bared teeth.
    However, the struggle continued more heatedly and developed. The traitor was shot, and the landlord and local tyrant were overthrown and defeated. The people vented their anger and turned over.
    Today, the hero's turban on Lao Wang's head is washed clean, his eyes are bright, his beard is shaved, and a smile appears on his healthy face. He was elected as the Liaison Defense Area Captain at the district liaison defense meeting.
    Whenever he has time, he learns to write his name - Wang Shucheng.
            The "Unmovable" Vat
    The masses stood chaotically in the courtyard and house of the landlord Wu Xinhua, shouting and preparing to move the number one large vat out of the house and carry it to the street to pay off his debts.
    "It can't be moved out, it was built into the house when the house was built!" someone shouted urgently.
    "Try it and see if it can be moved out, measure it with a rope," the worker said suspiciously.
    Everyone in the house was watching the comparison of a wheat stalk.
    "Just right, it can be carried out."
    The landlord's lackeys had already run away and disappeared.
            District Chief Meng
    District Chief Meng promised the masses to shoot the traitor and local tyrant Guo Fengtong.
    On October 29th, Lao Meng, wearing a holster and riding his bicycle, came to Yanwotai on the bank of the Zhang River. A man in plain clothes came towards him.
    "What are you doing?" Lao Meng asked. The two faced each other.
    "Going to the field."
    Lao Meng was about to leave when the man in plain clothes pointed to a village behind Lao Meng and said, "Why are the landlords in that village running away?"
    Lao Meng turned around to look.
    "Don't move!" The man in plain clothes pointed the muzzle of his gun at Lao Meng's back.
    Lao Meng didn't move. Smiling, he said, "Hey, what's this for? Take whatever you want."
    After saying that, Lao Meng suddenly turned his arm and knocked the man in plain clothes' holster off. Several bullets were fired in a row. But they all missed. The two wrestled together in the field.
    Finally, Lao Meng got the chance to draw his own holster and shot the man in plain clothes.
    (Note) The place names in the article are all in the third district of Linzhang County, on the border area.

　　临漳翻身二三事
    ·徐厂·
        工作员
    “靳主任，您大老远来这儿，真辛苦，叫咱老百姓翻身，咱从今能过好时光啦！老财他们愿意自动把地拿出来给群众分。您看，这样，不斗争，既省事，老百姓又有了地，多好！还有，群众翻身，您也该翻个身哪！您将来回家；路费…………嘿嘿…………老财………路费一二十万不成问题，咱还给您送一个匾。………”一向当衙役的一个贫农，鬼鬼祟祟地对工作员老靳说着，想挨近他。
    老靳回过头来瞧定他。
    “那个老财叫你来说的？”
    那人低下头，不啃声。
    “你别忘了本，忘了自己是贫农。你听我和你说…………”老靳厉声对他说；帮他刨起穷根来。
    村里的斗争闹了起来。
            联防区队长
    现在，老王从邯郸回来，眼病已治好。小平营村中，咒老王的话也不知去向了。
    月前，村里开始闹斗争，长工老王首先领头大胆干，他废寝忘餐，结实的身体一天天瘦下来，眼睛红肿，睁开费劲。
    “你看，那姓王的，脸成了条线，眼也瞎了。真脱了人像啦！”
    “谁杀了那姓王的小子，给十万。”
    老财和他们的腿子们，到处翅着牙乱咬。
    但是，斗争更火热地进行下去，发展开。汉奸被枪毙，老财恶霸被斗倒、斗垮。老百姓出了气，翻了身。
    今天，老王头上的英雄巾洗得白净，眼睛发亮，胡子刮光，健康的面孔上露出笑容。他在区联防会议上被选为联防区队长。
    他一有空就学着写自己的姓名——王树成。
            “搬不出”的大缸
    群众乱站在老财吴新花的院里屋里，嚷叫着，准备把头号大缸搬出屋，抬到街上，清偿他的债务。
    “搬不出去，那是盖房时盖到屋里面的！”一个人急促地喊。
    “试试，看出的去不，拿根绳子量量。”工作员怀疑地说。
    屋里的人都在注视着一根麦秆的比试。
    “刚刚好，抬的出去。”
    老财的腿子早已跑开，不知藏到那里去了。
            孟区长
    孟区长答应群众枪毙了汉奸恶霸郭凤桐。
    十月二十九日，老孟挂着盒子，骑着车子，来到漳河岸上燕窝台。对面来了个穿便衣的。
    “你是作啥的？”老孟问。二人面对面。
    “下地去。”
    老孟要走，穿便衣的指着老孟背后一个村子说：“怎的，那村老财都往外跑？”
    老孟转身看。
    “不许动！”穿便衣的将手枪口抵着老孟的背。
    老孟不动。笑着说：“唉，这是作啥，你要啥就拿啥吧。”
    话说完，老孟猛然回过胳膊，一下子打落了穿便衣的盒子。子弹连着射出好几颗。可都落了空。在地里，二人扭作一团。
    终于老孟得机抽出自己的盒子，一枪打中那个便衣。
    （注）文中各地名均在边沿区临漳县三区。
