　　[Report from our newspaper in the Jilu Yu region, 12th] After Chiang's puppet troops occupied Jining, American goods poured in, and Jining's national handicraft industry successively closed down, with general commerce greatly declining. In the past, under the support of our democratic government, there were a total of seventeen steel machine cigarette factories and more than a dozen hand-rolled cigarette factories such as the Yumin Cooperative. Now, Chiang's puppets have imposed a heavy tax of 50% on these cigarette factories. With the large-scale arrival of American cigarettes, each pack of 20 cigarettes comes with 20 matches, costing only 50 yuan in resistance currency. As a result, the cigarette factories have all closed down. After foreign matches arrived in Jining at 45 yuan a box, flint, tinder, and paper had to be taken out of the city. After American shoes arrived in Jining, leather-soled shoes cost less than 500 yuan a pair, and Jining's shoe shops also had to close down. With the arrival of American cloth, native cloth became unpopular. Now, Mobil oil lamps are lit everywhere, and the sales of local oils have also greatly decreased. The majority of handicraftsmen and workers have lost their jobs and are starving. Only the hairdressing salons for perming hair are relatively prosperous. Brothels have greatly increased, with 270 now openly operating. In short, the industrialists and businessmen of Jining have fully tasted the "flavor of the National Army" in the two months since Chiang's army arrived. They have clearly seen how Chiang Kai-shek is acting as a running dog for the United States to destroy China. Whenever they see the Eighth Route Army, they always ask, "When will you come to Jining?"

　　美货随蒋军滚滚来
    济宁工商业转趋萧条
    商民体验了蒋贼卖国待盼我军到来
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】蒋伪军进占济宁后，美货即源源而来，济宁的民族手工业相继倒闭，一般商业大为凋零。过去在我民主政府扶植下，共有十七家钢机烟厂和裕民合作社等十几家手卷烟厂，现蒋伪对这些烟厂加上了百分之五十的重税，美国烟大批到济，每包廿支还带二十支火柴，才合抗钞五十元，卷烟厂于是都倒闭了。洋火到济后，四十五元一盒，火石火镰火纸不得不拉出了城。美国鞋到了济＠后，皮底鞋还不到五百元一双，济宁的鞋铺也只得关门。美国布来了，土布即不行了。现在都点起了美孚洋油，本地油类的销售，也大大的减少。大多数手工业者和工人都失业挨了饿。只有烫发的大理发馆，比较发财。妓院大为增加，现已公开的就有二百七十家。总之蒋军到后两个月的济宁工商业家，已饱尝到了“国军的滋味，他们已清楚看到了蒋介石怎样的当美国的走狗灭亡中国，他们见到了八路军，总是问“你们什么时候来济宁”？
