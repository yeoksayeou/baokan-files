Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 9th: According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 8th, twelve hundred farmers in Nanhui City, southeast of Shanghai, demonstrated against conscription, set fire to the city's south gate, clashed with the garrison troops, and attempted to attack the county government. It is understood that Nanhui needs to conscript 430 soldiers. After the initial conscription of 180 people, the farmers rose up in demonstration, clashing with the army armed with hoes and bamboo poles. The Kuomintang authorities carried out barbaric suppression of the demonstrating masses, opening fire on the crowd and arresting eleven young people.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 9th: According to news from various newspapers, the flames of the Guangdong uprising have spread to twenty-seven counties, with approximately 6,400 people and weapons. In the Dongjiang River basin, there are more than 1,500 (Chief of Staff Li of Chiang Kai-shek's Guangzhou Headquarters also admitted at a symposium of commissioners and county chiefs that there were more than 1,200 people) active in the Ren Mountain of Huiyang, Dongyangye, the highway of Boluo, the ports of Haifeng and Lufeng, Lantang and Yuzhu of Zijin, and the counties upstream of the Dongjiang River, such as Heyuan and Heping. The rebels in the Hengli and Guanyinge areas have established their own regimes. According to a Hong Kong dispatch in a certain Shanghai private newspaper, many of these rebels could not endure the oppression of the Chiang government and killed village chiefs or government personnel before launching armed uprisings. One group of over a hundred people, carrying several machine guns and rifles, once stormed into Duozhu Township in Huiyang County on November 5th, engaging in fierce fighting with the police for three hours before safely withdrawing. Another group of two hundred advanced to the outskirts of Heyuan City on the night of October 21st and moved towards the plains.

In the Pearl River Delta region, there are more than 2,000 rebels with weapons (the Chief of Staff of the Guangzhou Headquarters only admitted to over 500), led by Chen Zhongque, Zheng Heng, Lin Bosheng, Rong Zikuang, etc., with activity areas reaching seven or eight counties, including Panyu, Nanhai, Shunde, Zhongshan, Jiangmen (Xinhui), etc. Their strongholds are in more than ten places such as Mangzhou and Muzhou, possessing a large number of Thompson submachine guns and some mortars. They once captured the Kuomintang and Navy's Haixing warship and the Guangzhou Provincial Government's Meilun Haitong. One group between Nanhai and Shunde recently intercepted the New Jinshan Wheel, seizing a large amount of guns and ammunition from the Kuomintang police force.

The rebel armed forces in the southern route (the Chief of Staff of the Guangzhou Headquarters also admitted to 1,400 people) are active in the Shiwan Mountains along the Guangdong-Guangxi border, possessing weapons such as small cannons and machine guns. This is a force combining guerrillas, local farmers, and original rebels from the Anti-Japanese War period. In the Moyang River area in Yangchun County, east of the Leizhou Peninsula, and in the Yunfu County area on the south bank of the West River, there are also peasant armed forces resisting the oppression of the Chiang government.

According to the Chief of Staff of the Guangzhou Headquarters, the rebel armed forces in the Han River basin, where Guangdong and Fujian adjoin, in the counties of Jiaoling, Dabu, and Zhape, total over a thousand people. In the Nanshan area southwest of this region, there are several small people's teams that frequently attack conscription and grain collection personnel. Along the Beijiang River, about 500 people often eliminate scattered troops coming and going from Guangzhou and attack military vehicles. In the Jiulian Mountains near Lianping County, on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi, there are also large numbers of rebel armed forces active.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 9th: Chongqing News: The people of Jiangbei County, across the river from Chongqing City, have collectively resisted conscription. Most of the residents in the Muer Township area of the county who are unwilling to be conscripted have gathered on a mountain near the county. In bunkers, they prepared a lot of lime. When the village chiefs chased them, they threw lime at the heads and faces of the village chiefs. One village chief's eyes were blinded by the lime. Afterwards, they fled back into the mountains.
