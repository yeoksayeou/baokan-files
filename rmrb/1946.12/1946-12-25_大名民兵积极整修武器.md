　　[Reported from Weixian on the 21st of this month] The Daming explosion and shooting training class is training intensely, and the villagers' militia are actively preparing for combat to meet the Jiang army's attack. A village in the Second District checked guns and hand grenades that would not fire and sent them to the ordnance repair shop for repair. The militia were busy sewing bullet pouches, grenade packs, wiping guns, and loading bullets. The self-defense force actively prepared stretchers. The village militia held a meeting and swore an oath. Ye Jingkui, a hired laborer and militiaman from × village, said, "We will launch sparrow warfare and mine warfare to fight the old Chiang to the end." Liang Jinrong, the village militia instructor, said, "Anyone who surrenders to the enemy and hands over their gun is not human!" After everyone successively swore an oath, Liang Jinrong added, "As long as everyone is determined, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will definitely defeat the old Chiang and live a peaceful life." The Daming city militia and the masses also swore an oath to fight the old Chiang to the end. The work of clearing the fields and emptying the houses in Daming City has been largely completed.
