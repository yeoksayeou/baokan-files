    East and West Victories Echo Each Other
    Our Army Recaptures Yuanqu and Puyang Counties
    Killing, Wounding, and Capturing Over 1,000 Chiang Troops, Including a Deputy Regiment Commander.
    The Democratic Order North of the Heze-Jining Highway Remains as Stable as Ever
    [This dispatch was] transmitted by the Jilu Yu Frontline of this newspaper on the 7th. After Chiang’s Fifth Army occupied Puyang County, it was met with successive counterattacks from our army and people. On the 6th, part of our army, in coordination with local armed forces, attacked the Chiang troops entrenched in Puyang County. The Chiang troops fled from Puyang County in a panic that evening, and Puyang County was recaptured by our army. The seized materials are currently being inventoried. Furthermore, on the eastern front, after our army recovered Yuncheng on the morning of the 3rd, our local corps and militia actively mopped up Chiang Kai-shek's local special service armed forces, destroying the Chiang regime's illegal political power composed of the "Returning Home Corps" and its puppet organization personnel. At this moment, the democratic order north of the Heze-Jining Highway is as stable as ever. The Chiang troops on the Heze-Jining Highway and those trapped in isolated cities such as Heze, Juye, Jiaxiang, and Jining are all facing the crisis of being annihilated.
    [This dispatch was] transmitted by the Jilu Yu Frontline of this newspaper on the 7th. During the battle to recover Puyang County, the Chiang American-equipped Fifth Army's 45th Division was annihilated in Xiaozhai, Maogang, Mazhai, Lizhuang and other places north of the city, suffering over 130 casualties. Two platoons of the 288th Regiment of its 96th Division, guarding the northwest corner of the city, were also completely disarmed by our troops, and 16 people, including platoon leader Su Bin, were captured. We seized one American-made submachine gun, twelve American-made rifles, and a quantity of ammunition.

    [This dispatch was] transmitted by the Southern Jin Frontline of this newspaper on the 7th. Our Taiyue Eighth Route Army has begun a partial counteroffensive. On the 5th, a powerful offensive was launched on the Jiang(xian)-Yuan(qu) Highway, annihilating most of the 163rd Regiment of the 85th Brigade of the 38th Division of the Chiang Army stationed in Yuanqu. Yuanqu County, which had been occupied by the Chiang Army for more than three months, was recaptured by our army on the 6th. For the past month, the Chiang army in Yuanqu has been conscripting laborers and building fortifications day and night. Our army's path forward was covered with the Chiang army's field fortifications and bunkers. The offensive began here at 11:00 PM on the 5th. The infantry advanced under the cover of artillery fire. At 4:00 AM on the 6th, a unit of our army, after five minutes of fierce fighting, first climbed the city walls of Yuanqu. One hour later, the entire city of Yuanqu was liberated. Our army continued to expand this breach, making the Chiang army's counterattack impossible. In 24 hours, in an area of 500 square *hua li*, 25 important strongholds of the Chiang army were cleared, including Zaili, Wangmao, Hongqingguan (ie. South Gate), Jilong Mountain, Xiaozhao, and Zhao Jia Ling, along with 80 bunkers. Over 720 officers and soldiers of the Chiang army's 163rd Regiment were captured alive, and over 400 were killed or wounded, including a deputy regimental commander. We seized four mortars, nine heavy machine guns, twenty light machine guns, over 300 rifles, over ten pistols, one radio station, eight telephones, over a hundred head of livestock, 5,000 *shi* of grain, and a quantity of ammunition. We controlled 30 *li* of the Jiang-Yuan Highway and the two ferry crossings on the Yellow River at Dongtan and Wanli. Detailed battle results are currently being inventoried. This major victory directly affected the entire war situation in southern Shanxi, linking the previously divided third and fourth sub-districts into one. In this battle, over 300 traitors and local tyrants who had committed crimes in Yuanqu City and formed the "Revenge Team," "Love Hometown Team," and "Counter-Settlement Team" were all captured. The people were overjoyed and celebrated seeing the light of day again.

    [This dispatch was] transmitted by the Southern Jin Frontline of this newspaper on the 7th. In order to cooperate with the main force, our Yuanqu Third District Armed Work Team, in conjunction with the militia, ambushed scattered soldiers of the Chiang army's 163rd Regiment near Liuzhuang, eight *li* east of Wangmao Town, on the evening of the 6th, capturing seven enemies and killing or wounding one. We suffered no casualties. We seized one light machine gun, eight rifles, and one pistol.
