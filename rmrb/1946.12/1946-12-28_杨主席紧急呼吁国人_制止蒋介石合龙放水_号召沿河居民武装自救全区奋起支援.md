　　【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper】Chairman Yang Xiufeng of the Border Region Government, on the 24th of this month, made the following statement to our reporter on the Yellow River issue: In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique collapsed without a fight. In order to avoid enemy pursuit, they did not hesitate to sacrifice the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of people in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and breached the dikes to release the water. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, which does not care about the people, again used the assistance of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to propose the Yellow River returning to its old course. Their conspiracy lies in dividing our liberated areas and submerging our seven million residents along the river. Our side originally could not agree, especially the residents of the old course of the Yellow River and both sides of the river channel resolutely opposed it; but in order to take the overall situation into consideration and sympathize with the people in the new river course of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, we painfully synchronized and successively signed four agreements with the Kuomintang. The spirit of these agreements was to first repair the dikes and dredge the river, organize dangerous works, and relocate the residents of the river course, and then block the breach and release the water. However, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique violated the previous agreements, disregarded the progress of the downstream project, and openly and actively blocked the breach. After the unanimous opposition of our entire region's military, government, and people, as well as the pressure of fair public opinion at home and abroad, they finally agreed to allocate a part of the project funds, materials, and relocation and relief expenses for the residents of the river course. This was originally a small amount, insufficient for the needs of the project, and what UNRRA and the Kuomintang financial authorities have transported to our area so far is only a part of the flour, the project funds allocated are less than a quarter, and the materials are almost zero. Our side has always adhered to the spirit of the agreement. Before the materials arrived, we had already mobilized 230,000 people to actively start work, but the Kuomintang did not repair the upstream dikes on the north bank of Dongming, but actively built the south bank, in an attempt to flood the north. By August, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique launched a large-scale military offensive against our Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, seizing and destroying most of our repaired materials, bombing and strafing our dike-repairing workers, and destroying our repaired river dikes in Juye, Puyang and other places. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique has done everything possible to sabotage, and the delay in relief expenses has led to the fact that our downstream project has not been completed so far, and the residents of the river course have not been relocated. The Chiang Kai-shek clique, in order to save the military failures of the past few months, is now urgently planning to release water to create disaster and submerge our area. Our side sent a telegram to UNRRA and the Executive Yuan on the 2nd of this month, putting forward four demands in order to save this critical situation, but the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique delayed answering. Looking at the attitude of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique towards the Yellow River issue, it is consistent with their political deception of the people and breach of faith. Now that a great disaster is imminent and a critical moment has arrived, I, on behalf of the seven million residents along the river, urgently appeal to UNRRA and democratic people across the country: Now that the severe winter has arrived, if the Yellow River overflows, the residents of the river course will either be drowned by the Yellow River or be displaced, and transportation will be blocked as a result, and assistance from outside the area will become difficult. Most residents will be put to death. It is hoped that the people of the whole country and righteous people will immediately rise up to stop the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique's poisonous plot to close the breach and release the water, and save these suffering people who have suffered from eight years of enemy disaster and one year of Chiang's disaster. We warn the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique: If you do not immediately stop closing the breach and releasing the water, and quickly allocate all project funds, materials, relocation and relief expenses, then those who play with fire will be burned, and those who play with water will drown, and you will surely eat your own serious consequences. We call on the seven million residents along the river: Rather than die from a great flood and be buried in the belly of fish, it is better to arm yourselves and fight to the death with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique in order to protect your lives and property and save yourselves. In order to facilitate the emergency needs of residents on both sides of the river, we must step up the construction of boats; in order to prevent the sudden arrival of floods and the drifting of our lives and property, we must quickly organize the relocation of residents in the river course to prevent disaster. The 30 million people in our entire border area should immediately mobilize and use all their strength to support the serious struggle of the people on both sides of the river.

　　杨主席紧急呼吁国人
    制止蒋介石合龙放水
    号召沿河居民武装自救全区奋起支援
    【本报特讯】边区政府杨主席秀峰特于本月二十四日就黄河问题对本社记者发表谈话如下：民国二十六年，蒋介石反动集团不战而溃，为避免敌人追击，竟不惜牺牲豫皖苏数十万人民生命财产，掘堤放水。抗战胜利后，不要人民的蒋介石反动集团，又借联总救济物资之助，提出黄河归故，其阴谋乃在于分割我解放区，淹没我沿河七百万居民。我方原实无法同意，特别是黄河故道以及河漕两岸居民更坚决反对；但我为顾全大体，轸念豫皖苏新道人民，乃忍痛同步，先后与国民党签订四次协议。其精神均为先修堤浚河，整理险工，迁移河道居民，然后堵口放水。乃蒋介石反动集团，违背历次协议，不顾下游工程进度，公然积极堵口，后经我全区军政民之一致反对，以及国内外公正舆论之压迫，始允拨付一部工款、工料及河道居民迁移救济费。此本微末，不足工程之需用，而联总及国民党财政当局至今运来我区者，亦只面粉一部，工款所拨则不足四分之一，而工料几等于零。我方则一直遵守协议精神，在物资未到前，即已动员二十三万人民，积极动工，而国民党却未动修东明北岸上游堤坝，反积极修筑南岸，以图北淹。殆至八月，蒋介石反动集团又对我冀鲁豫区发动大规模军事进攻，抢走毁坏我大部修工物资，轰炸扫射我修堤员工，并在鄄城、濮阳等地破坏我整修之河堤。蒋介石反动集团如此百般破坏，与救济费用之拖延，致我区下游工程，至今未能完工，河道居民亦未能迁移。蒋介石集团为挽救数月来之军事败绩，乃急谋放水造灾，淹没我区，我方乃于本月二日致电联总、行总提出四项要求，以挽此危局，讵料蒋介石反动集团拖延不答。综观蒋介石反动集团对黄河问题之态度，一若其政治上之一贯欺骗民众背信弃义。现在大祸将临，紧急关头已到，我谨代表沿河七百万居民，向联总及全国民主人士紧急呼吁：今严冬已届，倘黄水漫流，河道居民均将被黄水淹毙或流离失所，且交通将因此而阻隔，外区援助亦成困难，多数居民必将被置于死地，切望全国人民及正义人士，立即起而制止蒋介石反动集团合龙放水之毒谋，拯救此饱受八年敌灾一年蒋灾之苦难人民。我们警告蒋介石反动集团：如不立即停止合龙放水，迅速全部拨发工款工料迁移救济费等，则玩火者自焚，玩水者自没其顶，必自食其严重恶果。我们号召沿河七百万居民：与其死于洪水大患，葬身鱼腹，毋宁武装起来，为保卫生命财产与蒋介石反动集团拼死以自救。为便利两岸居民之紧急需用，加紧赶造船只；为防大水突临，漂浮我生命财产，迅速组织河道居民迁移，以防大难。我全边区三千万人民应即动员起来，用一切力量，以支援两岸人民之严重斗争。
