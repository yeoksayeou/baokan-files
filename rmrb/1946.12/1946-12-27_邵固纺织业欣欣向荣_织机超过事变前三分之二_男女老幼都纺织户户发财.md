[Our Newspaper Wei County Dispatch, 24th] The textile industry in the Shaogu area of Wei County is thriving under the support of the democratic government. In this town, four market days occur every ten days. On each market day, farmers gather from all directions, carrying various colored cloths, towels, and threads. Merchants from Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi travel constantly along the roads in rickshaws, ox carts, and bicycles. Currently, over ten thousand dozens of towels are exported, more than five thousand bolts of cloth, and around twenty thousand catties of thread are imported. An elderly weaver said, "Weaving is a great skill. Our town is truly making money faster than digging for gold. Every family lives a happy life, and I can earn three thousand yuan per market day." Even before the incident [likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War], this area was famous throughout major cities, but under the oppressive policies of the old government, weavers suffered from high-interest exploitation, and their lives were extremely miserable. As Zheng Mingqi recalled, "Poor weaving room, guarding the cloth, bare-assed." After the establishment of the democratic government following the Second Sino-Japanese War, the textile industry initially recovered, but due to the destruction by the enemy and puppet regime, it quickly declined again. The folk song "Every household has no rice, no firewood, and the village is deserted; the Japanese devils set fire to houses and looms, raising smoke" described the tragic situation at that time. After the victory against Japan, through land reform and the support of the democratic government, the sound of looms quickly revived, exceeding two-thirds of the pre-incident level. Zhao Chong and his mother returned from another village, redeemed the eight mu of land they had sold, and the government loaned them one thousand yuan as capital. They picked up the old craft again and earned over ten thousand yuan this year. Now, the mother and son eat well and wear warm clothes. Guan Di's Xu Baohe rebuilt two new houses and said proudly, "When the Japanese devils were here, the whole family was starving, skin and bones. Now we can eat pure rice, pure flour, and dry food." He pointed to a chubby child beside him and said, "When the Japanese devils were here, he was only five years old, so hungry that he crawled around picking up small bricks to eat. Now he has steamed buns to eat and also goes to school." Although Granny Chen is over fifty years old, she is still energetic. Wearing reading glasses, she treads on the loom every day. She now has savings of fifty thousand yuan. She said, "When my daughter grows up in two years and learns to weave, our life will be even better!" The weavers who have escaped from the sea of suffering are weaving day and night. "If you have a loom, you have food to eat" has become a common saying. Moreover, people's great wisdom has been fully developed. The Shaogu weavers invented the "lebu" loom, which can weave three bolts of cloth per day, two-thirds faster than the old looms. Fang Qingchen of Ding Village invented the "Eight Treasures Loom," which produces cloth that is both beautiful and durable, and is very popular among the masses. People say it is even better than foreign cloth. According to statistics from ten villages around Shaogu, there are more than two thousand boys and girls who can weave and spin. The social status of children has greatly improved. Everywhere you can hear elders praising children. The girls at the Guan Di Girls' School are in the open courtyard, winding threads and singing loudly, "Horses run fast, birds fly, my thread winds so fast." Teacher Wang Guilian said, "This is both a weaving room and a school." Since the implementation of the half-day system, learning in the morning and weaving in the afternoon, the number of students has increased from five or six to thirty-six. Teacher Wang Guilian weaves towels at night and teaches during the day, which is greatly loved by the masses.

　　邵固纺织业欣欣向荣
    织机超过事变前三分之二
    男女老幼都纺织户户发财
    【本报威县二十四日电】威县邵固集一带纺织业在民主政府扶植下欣欣向荣。该镇十天内四个集，每逢遇集的那天，农民们扛着各色花布、毛巾、线子，从四面八方聚集而来。河北、河南、山东、山西商旅们，驾驶着人力车、牛拉车、自行车，络绎于途。现在每条毛巾输出万打，花布在五千匹以上，线子的输入约两万斤左右。一位年迈的织民说：“纺织可是个好手艺，俺镇上真能胜过日进斗金，家家过着美满生活，我一集还能赚三千元。”远在事变前，这一带组织就驰名通都大邑，但织民们在旧政府的恶政下，受着高利盘剥，生活极度可怜，正如郑明旗追想过去所说：“穷机房，守着布，光屁股”。事变后，民主政府建立，纺织业曾一度恢复，但因敌伪的摧毁，很快的又冷落下去。“户户没来没柴断人烟，鬼子点房烧机起狼烟”的歌谣，就是记述当时的凄惨情况。抗战胜利后，经过土地改革和民主政府的扶植，机声又很快的复活了，并超过事变前三分之二。赵重母子从异乡逃回，赎回卖出的八亩地，政府又贷给他一千元作资本，旧手艺重拾，今年赚了十万多元，如今母子饱食暖穿。官地徐保和重新盖起两座新屋，得意的说：“鬼子在，是全家饿得皮包着骨头，现在能吃净米净面干粮了，”随手指着身旁的一个胖孩子说：“有鬼子时他才五岁，饿的爬着拾小砖吃，现在有馍头吃，也有学校上啦。”陈老太婆虽已年逾半百，而老当益壮，戴着老花眼镜，天天踏动着织布机，现拥有五万元的积蓄，她说：“待二年俺妮长大了，学会了织布，俺生活更好啦！”从苦海里跳出来的织民们，日夜不停息的纺织着，“有机子就有饭吃”，已成了普遍的通行语。不仅如此，人民高度的智慧，更得到充分发挥，邵固织民发明的勒布机，每天能织三匹布，较旧织布机快三分之二。丁寨房清臣发明的“八宝机”，出的布又美观又耐用，颇受群众欢迎，人们都说比洋布还好。据邵固周围十个村的统计，会织会纺的男女儿童有两千余名，儿童的社会地位大大提高，随处可以听到长辈们对儿童的夸耀。官地女校里的女孩子们，在露天的大院子里，绕着线子高唱着：“马儿快，鸟儿飞，我的线子绕的飞。”教员王贵栾说：“这里又是织房，又是学校。”自从实行了半日制，早晨上午学习，下午纺织，学生由五、六人增到卅六人。教员王贵栾夜里织毛巾，白天里去教书，很受群众爱戴。
