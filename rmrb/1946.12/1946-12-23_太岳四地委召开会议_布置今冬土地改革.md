　　Taiyue Fourth District Committee Holds Meeting
    Deploys Land Reform for This Winter
    [Taiyue 19th Dispatch] The Taiyue Fourth District Committee convened a mass work conference for the entire sub-region last month. Based on the District Committee's "July Meeting" policy of realizing "land to the tillers," the conference specifically deployed mass movement work for the entire sub-region. In order to accelerate the realization of "land to the tillers," the conference called for eliminating ideological obstacles among certain cadres, concentrating efforts to strive for the universal realization of "land to the tillers" throughout the sub-region by the end of January (or at the latest by the end of February). It also put forward different methods for different regions. In regions where the large-scale movement has already passed and "land to the tillers" has been basically realized, one-time leveling and replenishment should be implemented. In incomplete regions, the anti-traitor liquidation and rent and interest reduction should be further deepened. In terms of struggle methods, it was proposed that the new creations of the masses should be promoted, and a general liquidation and collective liberation movement should be launched. To this end, a thorough propaganda mobilization should first be carried out to further clarify the policy of realizing "land to the tillers" so as to mobilize the entire masses (including middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants) to carry out a general liquidation against traitorous despots and landlords. Everyone should pour out their grievances, everyone should liquidate, fight together, and liberate themselves together. This is to break the restrictions of "problems" so that all farmers in the district who have no land or little land have land to cultivate. Regarding the method of distributing the fruits of victory, it was called for planned distribution under unified leadership, adopting fair methods, and striving to achieve universality, evenness, and rationality.

　　太岳四地委召开会议
    布置今冬土地改革
    【太岳十九日电】太岳四地委于上月召开全分区的群众工作会议，根据区党委“七月会议”实现耕者有其田的方针，具体布置全分区的群运工作。为加紧实现耕者有其田，大会号召扫除某些干部的思想障碍，集中力量争取元月底（至迟至二月底）全分区普遍实现耕者有其田，并对不同地区提出了不同方法，除在大运动已过基本上已实现耕者有其田地区，应实行一次填平补齐外，在不彻底的地区，应进一步深入反奸清算减退租息，并在斗争方式上提出应发扬群众新的创造，展开一个总清算齐翻身运动。为此应首先进行一次深入的宣传动员，使大家进一步明了实现耕者有其田的政策，以便动员全体群众（包括中农及富裕中农在内），向奸霸地主来一次总清算，大家诉苦，大家清算，一块斗争，一齐翻身，这样来打破“问题”的限制，使全区无地或少地的农民都有地可种。在分配果实的办法上，号召在统一领导下有计划的分配，采取公平的办法，力求作到普遍、均匀、合理。
