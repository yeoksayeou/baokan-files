　　Please Provide Detailed Instructions for Making a Wooden Flour Mill
    Mr. Xu Bowen of Lifeng Village, Jiaozuo: We received a reader's letter stating that, in order to increase production, he would like to imitate the "wooden flour mill" you invented. However, the manufacturing method published in the previous issue of this newspaper was too simple. We hope you can provide a more detailed explanation, preferably with accompanying drawings, and send it to this newspaper as soon as possible so that we can inform the readers! We also hope that comrades from the Taihang Branch will urge the correspondent to complete this task.
                                              Editor
    Greetings!                  Attached letter: To the responsible comrades of the People's Daily:
    In the second section of the October 13th issue, you published a section called "People's Creations," primarily the first section on the "wooden flour mill" invented by Xu Bowen, a villager in Lifeng Village, Jiaozuo. In order to greatly increase production, I would very much like to imitate this flour mill, but the information published is not detailed enough, and I am not very skilled. I have been unable to successfully imitate it, so I am writing to request that the responsible comrades of the Editorial Department forward this letter to Comrade Xu Bowen. Please ask him to take the time to draw the wooden flour mill (first, a general diagram of the machine, and second, detailed diagrams of each part of the machine, drawing each part separately). Ideally, the dimensions, sizes, and shapes of each part of the machine should be drawn clearly and distinctly – this is my main request. Or, it would be even better if a more detailed explanation of the manufacturing method of the machine could be provided. Therefore, I earnestly request that you forward the diagrams as quickly as possible so that I can quickly and successfully imitate it. I especially request your great effort in forwarding this matter quickly.
        Sincerely,
                          Zheng Guihua, Qicun Village, Pingxiang, Hebei, November 11th (lunar calendar)

    焦作李封村许伯温先生：接读者来函，为了增产，很想仿造你发明的“木制磨面机”，但前次本报所登制造办法太简单，希望你能加以详细的说明，能附绘图更好，速寄本报，以便转告读者！更希望太行分社同志责成通讯员完成这一工作。

    敬礼！                  附来函：人民日报社负责同志：
    你们在十月十三日第二版上，登载“人民的创造”一段，主要是第一节登载焦作的李封村村民许伯温发明的“木制磨面机”，为了大量增加生产，我很想仿造一个这种磨面机，但登载的还不很详细，我又很笨，始终仿造不成功，所以去函恳请贵社编辑部负责同志转给许伯温同志，请他多费些精神将木制磨面机绘出（一是该机器的总图，二是该机每一部分一件的详图，一件一件分别绘出），最好将该机每一件的尺、寸、大小形像，都分别画的清清楚楚是我主要的要求，或者再将该机制造法能加一详细说明是更好了，为此恳请将图样快快转来，以便我能很快的仿造成功，特请多多费神快转是荷        此致
    敬礼
