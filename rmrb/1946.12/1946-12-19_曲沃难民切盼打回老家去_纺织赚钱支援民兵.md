(This dispatch from Taiyue) Refugees from Quwo, who have relocated to the Yicheng Liberated Area, are actively engaged in production. Besides providing themselves with food and clothing, they are also using materials to support the militia fighting on the front lines. Li Meila, a woman from Xiacun Village, bought two sheep with her weaving savings and also sewed ten pieces of clothing and twenty-five pairs of socks to comfort the home-guarding militia. Yue Guangdao, the chairman of the Lixiang Village Farmers' Association, makes a living by selling steamed buns. In addition to providing for his family of five, he often sends cigarettes, socks, and pocket money to his own militia. Dong Yaoxi from Beidong Village earned 10,000 yuan from spinning cotton and also used it to comfort the militia with a pair of pants and 300 yuan. They are doing everything they can to encourage their children and husbands to bravely kill the enemy and fight back to their hometowns.
