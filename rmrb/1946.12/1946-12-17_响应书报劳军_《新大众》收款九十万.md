　　Responding to Book and Newspaper Support for the Troops
    "New Masses" Collects 900,000
    [Our Newspaper] The book and newspaper support the troops movement initiated by the New Masses Society has spread to factories, government offices, schools, shops, and villages. Those who purchase books and newspapers to support the troops include commissioners, county heads, managers, district and village cadres, primary school teachers, cooks, barbers, orderlies... from seventy-year-old grandmothers to twelve and thirteen-year-old children, all are donating money and books, concerned about the cultural nourishment of the frontline soldiers. All the workers of the Handan Taichang Flour Company extracted 50,000 yuan from the fruits of the anti-traitor and debt-clearing struggle to be used for purchasing books to support the troops. Comrade Zhu Ruixi, a technician at the company, because he was liberated only after the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, voluntarily took out 5,000 yuan to buy books for the front line. The Limin Trade Union (including Limin Coal Mine and Linshui Power Plant), hearing that the front line needed books and newspapers, has already donated more than 220,000 yuan from all employees. When a factory in Zanhuang enthusiastically donated money to support the troops, the old lady of the factory manager Wang, after listening to it, also took out 100 yuan to buy books to support the troops. Cheng Qiyin, the director of the Yucheng County warehouse, hearing the news of book and newspaper support for the troops, said, "This is to hit Chiang Kai-shek's dog head, I would rather smoke a few fewer packs of cigarettes and donate money to buy books for the soldiers to read." Students from various high and primary schools in Tangyin, Zuoquan, Wu'an, and Shexian counties donated the money they earned from picking flowers, spinning thread, and chopping firewood. The New Masses Society has now received more than 900,000 yuan in donations from readers from various places. In addition to sending more than 30 kinds of books and magazines, more than 5,000 copies, to the front line, it is planned to send 5,000 copies of new books to the front lines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Taiyue, and Northern Henan during the New Year as New Year's gifts from the rear masses to the frontline soldiers.
    In addition, Yongxing and Xiecheng Printing Plants are rushing to print books and magazines for frontline cadres and soldiers. All employees of Xiecheng Printing Plant are preparing to bind 15 kinds of new books on the 15th to supply to the front line. A comrade from the engineering department of Yongxing Printing Plant said: "Our cultural support for the troops is to quickly typeset, quickly print, and quickly bind."
    In addition, the North China Xinhua Bookstore, in addition to editing and supplying books such as "The Hero of the Soviet Red Army," "The Only Son," "Marshal Suvorov," and "One Hundred Heroes" for frontline soldiers to read, also sent special personnel to the front line to interview whether the books and periodicals sent to the front line in the past were suitable for the tastes of the soldiers, and what kind of books and magazines the frontline soldiers needed, so as to facilitate future editing and distribution.
