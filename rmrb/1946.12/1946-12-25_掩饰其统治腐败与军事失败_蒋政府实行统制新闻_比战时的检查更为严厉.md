Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: To cover up its corrupt rule and military failures, the Chiang government has recently implemented news control in various regions. According to reports from Ta Kung Pao, Shanghai Wenhui Daily, and other sources: In Zhejiang, public employees of various provincial-level government agencies opposed the Chiang government's failure to implement its promise to adjust salaries every three months. Last month, they launched a collective petition movement and organized the "Hangzhou Public Employees' Committee for Demanding Improved Treatment," contemplating a work slowdown. Hangzhou newspapers published articles "speaking out for public employees." When the "Southeast News Agency" leaked news of the government misappropriating public employees' salaries, Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie immediately closed the news agency and prohibited all news agencies "not approved by the Central Government" from issuing稿件 (稿件 means contributions but in this case articles or submissions). It was also stipulated that all provincial government news would be uniformly issued by the Provincial Government Information Office, and reporters from various newspaper and news agencies were prohibited from interviewing about provincial government news. The Hangzhou Foreign Correspondents Association has held an emergency meeting to protest. In provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, the Chiang Kai-shek Wuhan Headquarters, in order to prevent the leakage of military "secrets" and unfavorable news, decided at the end of last month to establish a news team under the General Staff Office of the Headquarters to "centrally control" the release of news. News stations were set up in Hankou, Laohekou, Xinyang, Changsha, Hengyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang, and other places, stipulating that military news independently gathered by each newspaper and news agency must be approved by the news team before it can be released. Ta Kung Pao stated: "Various parties believe that this type of control seems even more severe than wartime censorship." The newspaper's headline also asked "Where is freedom of the press?". It is reported that Chiang government agencies in other regions are also implementing so-called "unified news release," refusing journalist interviews, and even the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has implemented it.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Beiping News: In order to further destroy freedom of speech, the Kuomintang has recently promulgated a method for newspaper and magazine publishers to renew registration certificates. According to the 14th Yishibao, "The Ministry of the Interior has recently issued an order to all provincial and municipal governments nationwide, stipulating that all newspapers and magazines that were approved for registration before July 35 and continue to be published must uniformly renew their registration certificates. At the time of renewal, in addition to the original registration certificate, a copy of the most recently published magazine or newspaper shall be submitted to the local competent authority for submission to the Ministry of the Interior for verification and issuance." According to insiders, the purpose of this measure by the Chiang government is to revoke the registration certificates of certain already registered private newspapers and periodicals, and force them to cease publication.

　　掩饰其统治腐败与军事失败
    蒋政府实行统制新闻
    比战时的检查更为严厉
    【新华社延安二十一日电】蒋政府近在各地实行统制新闻，企图掩饰其统治腐败与军事失败。据大公报、沪文汇报等消息：浙江因省级各机关公教人员反对蒋政府不实行三个月调整薪金一次诺言。上月曾发动集体请愿运动，组织“杭州公务人员要求提高待遇委员会”，酝酿怠工，杭州各报纸载“为公教人员请命”的文字。“东南通讯社”并泄露政府挪用公教人员薪金的消息，省主席沈鸿烈即封闭了该通讯社，并禁止所有“未经中央核准”的通讯社发稿，且规定一切省政府新闻概由省政府新闻处统一发稿，各报馆通讯社记者不得采访省政府新闻。杭州外勤记者协会已召开紧急会议，提出抗议。湘、鄂、赣等省则因蒋介石武汉行辕为防止泄露军事上的“机密”与不利等消息，上月底决定由行辕参谋处设新闻组，“集中控制”发布新闻，并于汉口、老河口、信阳、长沙、衡阳、九江、南昌等处设新闻站，规定各报社、各通讯社自行采访之军事消息，须经新闻组核准后方得发布。大公报称：“各方认为此种管制似较战时之检查更为严厉”。该报标题并谓“新闻自由从何说起”。据悉：其他各地蒋政府机关亦实行所谓“统一发新闻”，拒绝记者采访，甚至上海敌伪物产处理局亦已实行。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】北平讯：国民党为进一步摧残言论自由近又颁布一报纸杂志社换领登记证办法，据十四日益世报称：“内政部顷通令全国各省市政府，凡三十五年七月以前经核准登记迄今继续发行之报纸杂志，应一律换领新登记证。换领时，除原登记证外，并将最近发行之杂志或报纸一份，交由地方主管机关呈内政部核发。”据熟悉内幕人士透露，蒋政府此种措施之目的，在于取消某些业经登记的民间报刊的登记证，而迫其停刊。
