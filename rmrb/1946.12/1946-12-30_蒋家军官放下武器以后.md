　　Chiang Kai-shek's Military Officers After Laying Down Their Arms
　　Li Pu

　　The reporter visited the Jilu Yu Education Regiment in a certain place the day before yesterday. This place houses Chiang's army officers of school and lieutenant ranks who laid down their weapons on the Jilu Yu battlefield in the past four months. In addition to those released successively, there are still more than 1,600 people. First of all, I asked about their lives. Lei Yingxiu, the deputy battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 58th Regiment of the 25th Brigade and a graduate of the Chengdu Military Branch School, a Major, said to me: "I have been here for more than three months. The Eighth Route Army's respect for our personality really makes us grateful, and the preferential treatment in material life is secondary. This time on the battlefield, I ran away three times in a row. When I was caught the fourth time, I smiled and said, I will never run away again."

　　When they were first captured, they were all worried that they would not survive. Military school graduates were especially afraid of being buried alive, because Chiang Kai-shek had promoted that idea to them. But the fact is that everyone was given shoes, towels, toothbrushes, and soap. The school officer team received 80 yuan per person per day for food and 20 cigarettes. The lieutenant officer team received 50 yuan per person per day for food and five cigarettes. The Eighth Route Army cadres who managed them had only 20 yuan per person per day for food. They were divided into many economic committees for management, and each detachment held a life discussion meeting every week in the evening, where everyone offered their opinions. Their pens, watches, and so on were not missing at all, and the legal currency they brought could be exchanged for the local currency of the Liberated Area. I specifically looked at their savings, the most of which was one hundred and fifty-three ten thousand legal currency.

　　Now, their life experience has allowed them to understand the Liberated Area. An army captain from the 74th Brigade of the 55th Division told me: "We are living in a 'social university' here." These four words are very appropriate. They are receiving education from all the facts of Chinese society, including both the Liberated Area and the Kuomintang area.

　　Lieutenant Zhang Jingmin, adjutant of the 1st Battalion of the 220th Regiment of the 74th Brigade of the 55th Division, told me: "We have not seen any beggars or idlers since we came to the Liberated Area. Now we know that the Communist Party is a good political party."

　　The education regiment has moved to many places, and the guards are all militiamen from local villages. Once, someone said to a militiaman: "There are so many of us, what's the use of your broken gun?" The militiaman replied: "Then you can try." When they arrived at another village, this person said to a militiaman again: "You hear the cannons over there, the Central Army is about to hit here. What good will you get from following the Eighth Route Army?" The answer was very straightforward: "Come on! Killing one is enough, killing two is a profit."

　　They are now all wearing Eighth Route Army cotton-padded clothes. The Eighth Route Army cadres have not yet put on cotton-padded shoes themselves, but they first distributed them to them. Some of the newly captured came wearing cotton-padded clothes, and asked for more, because the cotton-padded clothes on the Kuomintang side were short and thin, and even the cotton seeds had not been removed. The most interesting thing is that some individual quartermasters refused to tell their true positions after being captured, for fear that others would want to settle accounts with them.

　　Only here did they see the full text of the Political Consultative Conference's ceasefire agreement, which surprised and angered them very much. The recent convocation of the one-party "National Assembly" and the signing of the so-called Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty caused their faith in their leader to collapse at once.

　　After they initially recognized Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship and the Communist Party's essence of serving the country and the people, some people suddenly realized the "integrity" issue that they had once worried about, and discussed it in groups. Lieutenant Shen Fan, secretary of the regimental headquarters of the 9th Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the 3rd Division, told me: "Now we have realized that if we are not on the side of the people, there is no integrity to speak of. Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei are the most unprincipled. We will not be slaves of traitors, and this is the people's integrity."

　　蒋家军官放下武器以后
    李普
    记者前天到某地参观冀鲁豫教导团，这里收容着四个月来在冀鲁豫战场上放下武器的蒋军校尉两级军官。除陆续释放者以外，现在还有一千六百多人。首先，我问起他们的生活。二十五旅五十八团三营副营长、成都军分校毕业的雷英修少校向我说：“我来了三个多月，八路军对我们的人格尊重真使我们感激，物质生活的优待还在其次。这回在战场上我连续跑了三次，第四次把我捉住的时候，我笑了，我说，我再也不跑了”。
    刚刚被俘时，他们都耽心不会有活命，军校毕业生尤怕被活埋，因为蒋介石是这样向他们宣传的。但事实是，每人发了鞋子、毛巾、牙刷、肥皂，校官队每天每人八十元菜金、二十枝纸烟。尉官队每人每天五十元菜金，五枝纸烟。而管理他们的八路军干部，每人每天的菜金不过是二十元。他们分组许多经济委员会管理，每星期晚上各分队开生活讨论会，大家提意见。他们身上的钢笔手表等等一无缺少，带来之法币可以兑换解放区之本币使用。我特地去看了他们之存款，最多的一个他有一百五十三万法币。
    现在生活体验使他们认识了解放区。五十五师七十四旅一个上尉对我说：“我们是在这里住‘社会大学’。”这四个字说得很恰切，他们是在受着全中国社会一切事实的教育，解放区和国民党地区两方面都包括在内。
    五十五师七十四旅二二○团一营副官张敬民中尉对我说：“我们到解放区来没有见过乞丐和闲人，现在我们知道了共产党是一个好的政党。”
    教导团迁移过许多地方，担任警戒的都是当地村子里的民兵有一次有一个人向一个民兵说：“我们有许多人，你一支破枪有啥用？”那个民兵回答说：“那么你们就试试。”到了另一个村子，这个人又对一个民兵说：“你们听那边炮响，中央军就要打到这里来了，你眼着八路军有什么好处”？回答是很干脆的：“来吧！打死一个够本，打死两个赚一个。”
    他们现在都穿上了八路军棉衣，八路军的干部们自己还没有穿上棉鞋，却先给他们发了。有些新近被俘的已经穿了棉衣来，又要求再发，因为国民党那边棉衣又短又薄，甚至于棉籽都没有打掉。最有趣的是有些个别军需官被俘以后，不肯说出自己的真实职份，为的是怕别人会要找他算帐。
    他们在这里才看到了政治协商会议停战协定的全部文献，这使他们十分惊异而且愤怒。最近一党“国大”的召集，和所谓中美商约的签订，使他们对他们这位领袖的信仰一下子崩溃下来。
    当他们初步认识了蒋介石的卖国独裁和共产党的为国为民的本质以后，有些人忽然觉悟到被他们所曾经顾虑的“气节”问题了，并且分组讨论过。三师七旅九团团部秘书沈泛中尉对我说：“现在我们已经认识出如果不是站在人民方面，便没有气节可言。蒋介石同汪精卫是最没有气节的了，我们不做卖国贼的奴隶，这正是人民气节。”
