　　Defend Our Homeland, Defend Our Fruits
    Over Two Thousand Young Men from Hengshui Join the Army
    [This newspaper, Weixian, 29th dispatch] After the news of Chiang's troops invading Southern Hebei reached Hengshui, two thousand eight hundred young men rushed to the self-defense front to defend their homeland and protect their gains. After discussing the current situation, the emancipated farmers of the Second District strengthened their determination to kill the enemy ideologically. Then, taking the sub-district as a unit, they launched a campaign to challenge each other between sub-districts and villages to join the army. The entire district guaranteed that seven hundred and sixty young people would enlist. On the morning of the fifth day of the Third District's mobilization rally, under the leadership of Comrade Yang Shangqing, a leader loved by the people, the militia collectively joined the army. They swore to the people who were sending them off, "Rest assured, we will not return home until we drive back Old Chiang, even if it means death." Shi Jinfan, an assistant public security officer, and Comrade Wang Fan, director of the Third District's Military Affairs Committee, raised their fists and swore: "We will not return home until we defeat Old Chiang's offensive." That day, two hundred and seventy young people went to the front line. The enthusiasm of the masses in the entire district to fight Old Chiang was unprecedentedly high. Young people generally believed that "Without eliminating Chiang's troops, we will have no peace." On the fourth day of the district's mobilization rally, five hundred and forty young people had already signed up to join the army, all showing unparalleled enthusiasm for killing the enemy. Army heroes wearing glorious flowers sat on both sides of the reviewing stand, surrounded by thousands of people. Comrade Hu Tiewei spoke on behalf of one hundred and thirty army heroes, "We guarantee that we will not desert. If we desert, we are not Chinese!"... By the fifth day, six hundred and thirty young people had signed up. Village cadres throughout the district made guarantees of preferential treatment for military families. The Sixth District saw a surge of four hundred and thirty new soldiers. On the tenth of this month, new soldiers from twelve villages gathered. After lunch that day, the sound of gongs and drums reverberated. Lions from Nandujia Village, stilt walkers from Lijia Village, and Yangko dancers from Wuhua Village all came to see them off. Representatives from various villages and family members of the soldiers repeatedly urged the army heroes: "Kill more Chiang soldiers and dedicate yourselves to the foremost front of the country." Comrade Wei Zhenshan jumped out of the ranks of the new soldiers and shouted, "Joining the army is the most glorious thing! We will never desert. We swear not to return home until we drive back Old Chiang!" Then, the long snake-like line densely moved forward, and the masses along the way cheered and offered wine and food.
