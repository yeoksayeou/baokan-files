(This newspaper's) Report from the border region of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, November 11th: Since August 26th to December 3rd, within one hundred days, the Gaoling militia heroically repelled the Chiang's puppets' invasion, fighting 54 battles and killing or wounding over 160 Chiang's puppets, and capturing 6 people. County and district cadres personally led every battle. Comrade Chen Piyu of the Fourth District Military Committee, gloriously sacrificed his life in the counter-grain-grabbing struggle in Zuitou. The county recently reviewed the shortcomings of fighting passive battles in the past 100 days. In the future, they should rely on the border areas and carry out active, decentralized, concealed, and flexible guerrilla warfare in the guerrilla areas and Chiang-occupied areas. County and district cadres should combine with the militia guerrillas to carry out surprise attacks against the enemy, counter-"encirclement and suppression," eliminate traitors, and conduct mass work.

    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】自八月二十六日到十二月三日一百天内，高陵民兵英勇的击退蒋伪进犯，共作战五十四次，毙伤蒋伪一百六十余人，俘六名。每次战斗县区干部都亲自带领。四区武委会陈丕玉同志，在嘴头反抢粮斗争中，光荣殉国。该县最近检讨了过去一百天中，曾有打被动战的缺点，今后应以边沿区作依托，在游击区与蒋占区中，开展主动、分散、隐蔽、灵活的游击战，县区干部与民兵游击队结合进行袭敌反攻“清剿”除奸及群众工作。
