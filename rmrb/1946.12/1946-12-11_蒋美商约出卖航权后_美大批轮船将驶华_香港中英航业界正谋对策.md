Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: According to a Hong Kong dispatch in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily of the 21st, after the signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, a major American shipping company, in order to cooperate with the implementation of the treaty, has formulated a plan to dispatch more than 30 ships on a regular basis to ports in North China, Central China, South China, and Southeast Asia (including the Philippines, Hong Kong, Australia, Siam, etc.) by the end of this year. The Hong Kong office of the shipping company has been greatly expanded, preparing to "make great strides" in the Far East. Since the release of this news, not only the overseas Chinese shipping industry but also the British shipping industry have been greatly alarmed. Several British shipping companies in Hong Kong (such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson) and several Chinese-operated shipping companies immediately held informal meetings to discuss countermeasures. The British shipping industry is particularly anxious because it has fewer ships than the United States, and British exports cannot compete with those of the United States. However, the meetings have not yet yielded any results.

    蒋美商约出卖航权后
    美大批轮船将驶华
    香港中英航业界正谋对策
    【新华社延安八日电】据二十一日沪文汇报载香港通讯称：中美商约签订后，据此间某报披露美某大轮船公司，为配合中美商约的实施，则已拟定计划，预定于今年底派遣三十多艘轮船经常航行华北、华中、华南、以及南洋各埠（包括菲律滨、香港、澳州、暹罗等地）。该轮船公司香港办事处已大事扩充，准备在远东“大展鸿图”。自该消息发表后，不仅华侨航界而且英商航界也大感惊慌，香港若干英商轮船公司（太古、渣甸等）与若干华商经营的轮船公司，立即召开非正式会议，共谋对策，尤以英国航界为着急，因为它的轮船不及美国多，英国的出口货亦不能与美国抗衡，但会议尚无结果。
