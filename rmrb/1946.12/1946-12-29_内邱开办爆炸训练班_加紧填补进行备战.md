　　Neiqiu Opens Explosives Training Class
    Speeding Up Preparation for War
    [This newspaper, Neiqiu News] The Neiqiu County Headquarters ordered the entire county to accelerate war preparations. Once the Chiang troops arrive, immediately and universally launch guerrilla and explosives warfare behind enemy lines. First, completely destroy all remaining enemy and puppet bunkers and fortifications from the past, and fill in blockade ditches and walls. Second, thoroughly implement the "empty village" policy. In villages within ten li of the Pinghan Railway, in addition to urgently needed grain and utensils, all other grain, utensils, clothing, bedding, cotton, cloth, farm tools, etc., must be dispersed and buried. The western half of the first and second districts (beyond ten li) and the eastern half of the third district must intensify war preparations to avoid being destroyed. Third, establish a mass intelligence network at the district and village levels. Each district and village must have reliable personnel responsible for intelligence work, and districts and villages must maintain close contact with each other. If war comes, supply each other with intelligence to avoid being caught off guard. Fourth, take air defense measures. When enemy planes come, immediately take cover. Air raid posts will also be set up in the urban area of the county seat. Fifth, strengthen guard posts. Set up guard posts in all villages in the new areas; establish key guard posts on main traffic routes to prevent Chiang Kai-shek's special agents from operating. The County Armed Forces have also decided to open an explosives training class for over a hundred people to specifically learn various explosives methods. The entire county is seizing the gaps to "fill and make up," thoroughly realizing "land to the tiller." The movement to turn over (get land) combined with defending the fruits (war preparation) is vigorously developing. Once war comes, the masses of the entire county can immediately launch guerrilla and explosives warfare throughout the county, eliminating the enemy in the invasion area.
