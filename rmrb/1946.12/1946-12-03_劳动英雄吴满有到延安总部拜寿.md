　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Wu Manyou, a labor hero from the Border Region, representing the villagers of Wu Family Date Orchard, visited the Yan'an Headquarters at 2:00 PM today to offer birthday greetings to Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The village held a defense of Yan'an work inspection meeting on the 28th, where they also discussed how to celebrate Commander-in-Chief Zhu's birthday. Some suggested sending chickens, others suggested sending noodles, but in the end, everyone agreed that intensifying the self-defense war effort would be the best birthday gift and appointed Wu Manyou to deliver the congratulatory letter. The letter stated: "You and Chairman Mao have only been in the Border Region for ten years, and the people are already well-fed and clothed. Our village's autumn fields can yield 200 shi of grain, averaging more than one shi of surplus per mu. This is all the result of Chairman Mao and your concern and leadership. But Chiang Kai-shek is not happy and wants to attack, so we are intensifying preparations for the self-defense war to wish you a happy birthday." Zhang Yongtai, a former landlord from Yan'an, also brought a personally written birthday poem, two bottles of homemade wine, twenty birthday peaches, and birthday noodles with meat at 3:00 PM this afternoon to offer birthday greetings.

During the conversation, Yang Buhao said that the more than 50 mu of crops he planted this year yielded more than 60 shi of grain, averaging more than one shi per mu. He also said that when his township heard that Zongnan was going to attack the Border Region, the entire township was filled with righteous indignation. All the young people voluntarily requested to join the militia and guerrilla队. The public grain that was due has been sent to the government. The young children were pasting soles, the girls were twisting hemp rope, and the women were sewing shoes. The entire township completed the military shoes in just four days.
