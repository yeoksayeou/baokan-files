　　[This article was] transmitted by [our] correspondent in Changzhi on the 7th: Yuanshi Xitongxia Village has organized a powerful local rifle team, frequently striking at harassing enemies and protecting the villagers' safe emancipation. In August and September of this year, Xitongxia Village launched an emancipation movement and achieved great success. In two months, farmers obtained more than 100 mu of land and a great deal of housing and supplies. In late September, after the stubborn puppet army invaded and occupied Nanzuo Town (eight li from Xitongxia), they frequently harassed [the area]. The movement in Xitongxia gradually declined. Village Chief Chen Shuanghe, Armed Director Kang Hongdan, and Li Xueqin then called on the villagers to protect their fields and defend themselves. More than 60 young people formed a powerful militia force, and Li Qin Xue led more than 30 capable young people to form a militia local rifle team, setting up sentry posts and burying mines day and night to protect the masses' emancipation. The movement then continued in early November, with more than 1,700 farmers participating and achieving even greater victories. Since the appearance of this people's armed force in Xitongxia Village, the stubborn puppets in Nanzuo Town have dared not easily [engage in military] activities again. In early November, when more than 30 members of the Home Returning Corps came out to seize grain, the local rifle team heard about it and circled behind them to attack, causing them to scurry back to Nanzuo without reaching their destination. The local rifle team also often went to neighboring villages to publicize our army's victories, strengthening the masses' confidence in victory. Influenced by Xitongxia, nearby villages such as Huquan have also formed self-defense armed forces. Li Qin Xue's local rifle team has become a powerful barrier for the masses' emancipation in the Xitongxia area.
    [This article was] transmitted by Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 4th: After the self-defense captain of a certain village behind enemy lines in Wenshui, Li San'er, was allotted four and a half mu of land, he proposed to the masses to establish a guerrilla team to protect their rice bowls, which was immediately met with enthusiastic response from the masses. The militia captain, who had just returned from another village, led the entire militia to join the army, and five old women also sent their sons to join the army. Within three days, more than 40 young people were gathered. On the 6th of last month, the villagers led cattle and carried wine to celebrate the establishment of the guerrilla team with grand folk rituals, elected Li San'er as the captain, and named it "Li San'er Guerrilla Team."

　　元氏西同下村
  　组织土枪队保卫翻身
  　晋绥文水敌后某村成立游击队
    【本报长治七日电】元氏西同下村组织强大的土枪队，经常打击出扰之敌，保护全村群众安然翻身。今年八、九月间，西同下村一度开展翻身运动，获得很大成绩，两个月中，农民取得土地百余亩及房屋用品甚多。九月下旬顽伪军侵陷我南佐镇（距西同下八里）后，经常出扰，西同下运动渐显消沉，村长陈双合、武装主任康红旦、李学琴乃号召村人保田自卫，当有青年六十余人，组成强大的民兵武装，并由李琴学领导三十余精干青年成立了民兵土枪队，日夜放哨埋雷，保护群众翻身，运动遂于上月初旬继续展开，参加运动的农民有一千七百余人，获得更大的战绩。自西同下村出现了这支人民武装，南佐镇的顽伪就再不敢经易活动。上月初旬还乡团卅余人出来抢粮时，该土枪队闻悉，绕到其背后夹击，使其未达目的地即慌忙窜回南佐。土枪队并常到邻村宣传我军胜利，坚定群众胜利信心，附近胡泉等村在西同下的影响下亦组成自卫武装。李琴学的土枪队，已成为西同下一带群众翻身的有力屏障。
    【新华社晋绥四日电】文水敌后某村自卫队长李三儿分得四亩半土地后，乃向群众提出成立游击队，保卫饭碗，当即得到群众热烈响应。刚从外村赶回来的民兵队长带领全体民兵参军，五个老太婆亦送子前来参军，三日内集中起四十余青年。上月六日，全村群众牵牛提酒、以隆重民间礼乐庆祝游击队的成立，选举李三儿为队长，并定名为“李三儿游击队”。
