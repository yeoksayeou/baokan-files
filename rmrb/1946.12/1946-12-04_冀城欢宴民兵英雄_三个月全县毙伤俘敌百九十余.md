　　【This dispatch from Taiyue on the 2nd】 Jicheng County rewarded and celebrated sixty-six militia combat heroes from the county's patriotic self-defense war on the 20th. Among them were the well-known county-wide explosion hero Zhang Baozhi, Shen Qingxi, who combined the struggle against counter-settlements and land protection, and the model retired soldier Qiu Dingyuan. At the meeting, the heroes reported on their typical battles. The most vivid was Zhang Baozhi's Zhainan explosion. Before the Zhainan explosion, he had planted mines three times, but they were all taken away by the enemy's "Advance Team." After research, he found that he was not well integrated with the local people, and he could not effectively protect the masses or find out the "Advance Team's" movement patterns. After removing this shortcoming, the fourth time he planted a mine, he wounded the "Advance Team's" Captain Zhu. Zhang Baozhi said at the meeting: "As long as we unite with the local people, the explosion will definitely be successful." Since September, the county's militia has fought 55 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 194 enemies below the battalion commander level, and forcing the enemy to retreat from the Liangbi, Shangshi, Fengkan, Xiaoshi, Xizhang, and Xiangyangpo strongholds. Two-thirds of the county's villages are still completely controlled by us, and the village government is working as usual.

　　冀城欢宴民兵英雄
    三个月全县毙伤俘敌百九十余
    【本报太岳二日电】翼城县于二十日奖励与欢宴全县爱国自卫战争中的六十六个民兵战斗英雄。其中有闻名全县的爆炸英雄张保芝、结合反倒算保地斗争的申清溪及模范荣退军人邱定园。在会上众英雄报告自己的典型战斗。以张保芝治南爆炸为最生动。他在治南爆炸以前，曾埋过三次雷，均被敌“挺进队”起走，经研究后，发现与当地老百姓结合不够，一不能很好掩护群众、二不能找出“挺进队”的行动规律。去掉这个缺点之后，到第四次埋雷，就把“挺进队”的朱队长炸伤了。张保芝在会上说：“只要与当地老百姓结合起来，爆炸一定成功。”全县民兵自九月以来，共作战五十五次，毙伤俘营长以下一百九十四名，逼退了梁壁、上石、冯侃、小史，西张、向阳坡三个据点的敌人。全县现有三分之二的村子仍被我完全控制，村政权照常进行工作。
