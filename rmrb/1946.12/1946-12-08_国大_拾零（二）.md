Gleanings from the "National Assembly" (II)

	Organizing "Friendship Associations" to Compete for Chairman Position

	Before the election of the presidium, two types of people appeared in Nanjing: those who "carried the sedan chair" and those who "held the lantern," helping their masters vote. The former were delegates, and the latter were non-delegates. Delegates from each province organized "friendship associations" to "fight" for this goal. One delegate stood on a chair and shouted, "I'll exchange my forty-six votes with you!" Another delegate pointed to a number and loudly replied, "We have fifty-two votes, willing to exchange!" When a deal was made, everyone roared with laughter. A reporter from a certain newspaper said they were a "stock exchange."

	Announcing the List for Half an Hour, Delegates Half Asleep

	During the preparatory meeting for the election of the presidium, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou read the list of presidium candidates for half an hour. Most of the delegates fell asleep, even some of the most active photographers were dozing off. During the formal election, most delegates received a list of thirty-five people. This was a list circled by the Kuomintang authorities for everyone to "refer to." Pan Changshi, the general manager of Chongqing Bank and a delegate from Sichuan, said to his neighbor from time to time during the election, "Just choose anyone. If I were to choose seriously, I would definitely choose Mei Lanfang."

	Like Someone Protesting Too Much, Chen Lifu Outsmarts Himself

	After the so-called presidium was elected on the 22nd, Chen Lifu and others resigned, and Shao Lizi and others were appointed as replacements. Shao seemed uninterested in this "honor," and immediately declared that he would not accept it, citing poor health. As for Chen Lifu's resignation from the chairmanship, people said it was to avoid criticism that the "National Assembly" was controlled by the "CC Clique," like someone protesting too much.

	"Opening Soda" His Sing Sounded, "Prosperity" Presented on the Conference

	Sometimes a kind of "prosperity" also appeared in the meeting, that is, when the delegates did not want to listen to someone speak, they would make a loud "hissing" sound to show their opposition. It is said that this happened seven or eight times at each meeting. Bao Deming was the first female delegate to speak, but she was booed off the stage as soon as she went on. The specific term for this booing on the conference is "opening soda."

	Ma Weng, a delegate from Xikang, said at the "assembly" that Sun Yat-sen was a compassionate Bodhisattva who advocated helping small and weak nations, but these weak nations were being ignored at the meeting.

	Editor of a Newspaper in Beiping Criticized the National Assembly and Was Invited to a Long Conversation

	According to a report in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on the 23rd, an editor of a newspaper in Beiping was "invited" by the authorities to a "conversation" because he published a frank criticism of the "National Assembly" from an American newspaper. Ah! It was not a "conversation," it was a "long conversation." Someone said: This is a good symbol of "returning power to the people."

　　“国大”拾零（二）
    组织“联谊会”争夺主席位
    在选举主席团以前，南京市上出现了“抬轿子的”与“提灯笼的”两种人，帮主子投票。前者是代表，后者是非代表，各省代表都组织了“联谊会”来为此一目标“奋斗”。一个代表站在椅子上大声叫喊我以四十六票和你们交换，另一代表用手指着数目大声回答：“我们是五十二票，愿意交换”。一桩生意成功了，大家哄笑。某报记者说他们是“交易所”。
    宣布名单半点钟代表半入睡眠中
    选举主席团的预备会议中，秘书长洪兰友宣读主席团候选名单达半小时，代表们大部入睡眠状态，连最活跃的摄影记者，也有几个在打盹。正式选举时，大多数代表都接到一张三十五人的名单。这是国民党当局圈定的要大家“参照”。重庆银行总经理四川代表潘昌氏，在选举时，不时对邻座说：“随便选了就是，若要认真选，我一定选梅兰芳”。
    此地无银三十两陈立夫弄巧反拙
    二十二日“国大”所谓主席团选出后，陈立夫等请辞，而以邵力子等递补。邵氏对此“荣誉”似不感兴趣，当即声明不应命而以身体不好为辞。至于陈立夫之辞当主席，人云是为避免批评“国大”由“ＣＣ”操纵，此地无银三十两。
  　“开汽水”嘘嘘声响会场上呈现“繁荣”
    会场上有时也呈现一种“繁荣”，即当代表们不愿听人发言时，就大发“嘘嘘”之声，以示反对。据说每次会议，都发生七八次之多。包德明乃女代表中第一个发言者，但刚上台就被嘘下台了。会场上对这种嘘声的专用名词是“开汽水”。
    西康代表麻翁在“大会”发言称：孙中山为大慈大悲的大菩萨，提倡扶助弱小民族，但弱小民族却在会上被人忽视云。
  　北平某报批评国大编辑被请长期谈话
    据沪文汇报二十三日透露：北平某报编辑，因为刊载了美报对“国大”的直率批评，竟被当局请去“谈话”，啊！不是“谈话”，是“长期谈话”，有人说：这就是“还政于民”的很好象征。
