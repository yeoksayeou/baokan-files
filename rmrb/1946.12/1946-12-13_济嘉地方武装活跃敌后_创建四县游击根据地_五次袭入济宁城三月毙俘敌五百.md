    [This Dispatch from Our JiluYu Office on the 10th] Since the fall of Jining in the Seventh District, our district, county and district armed work teams, militia, and other local armed forces have continued their struggle around Jining, raiding the north and south gates of Jining city five times. In the past three months, they have engaged in more than 30 battles of various sizes, killing and wounding over 200 enemies and capturing over 300 alive. After the enemy occupied Jiaxiang, they divided their forces to occupy Changgou. Jiang's puppet forces, including Yan Xian Shu's troops, took the opportunity to rampantly conscripted men, seize grain, and murder village cadres and masses south of the Ji (Ning) Jia (Xiang) Road. In Jianan alone, more than 40 people were killed. Our Ji-Jia local armed forces, to resolutely protect the interests of the masses, resolutely penetrated the junction area of Jining, Jiaxiang, Jinxiang, and Yutai. After a month of arduous struggle, they have achieved significant victories, striking at the local Jiang special armed "Self-Defense Corps" and "Returning Home Corps," suppressing two of the worst local tyrants. From then on, treacherous bullies and landlords no longer dared to "fall to the ground" or "fall to the grain." The masses deeply recognized their own armed forces, and actively helped with reconnaissance and guidance. Even a small number of landlords who previously opposed us, after suffering the ravages of Jiang's puppets, also requested that the people's armed forces not leave. The Ji (Ning) Jia (Xiang) Jin (Xiang) Yu (Tai) guerrilla base area behind enemy lines, directly threatening the enemy and puppets in Jining, is growing stronger day by day in the struggle.

    济嘉地方武装活跃敌后
    创建四县游击根据地
    五次袭入济宁城三月毙俘敌五百
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】七分区自济宁失守后，我分区及县区武工队民兵等地方武装，在济宁周围继续坚持斗争，五次袭入济宁城南北关，三月来大小战斗三十余次，毙伤敌二百余，生俘三百余人。敌占嘉祥后，即分兵进占长沟，蒋伪阎先树等部，乘机在济（宁）嘉（祥）路南大肆抓丁、抢粮、杀害村干及群众。仅嘉南被杀者即达四十多人。我济嘉地方武装，为坚决保护群众利益，毅然挺入济宁、嘉祥、金乡、鱼台接合地带，经一月之苦斗，已获重大胜利。打击了当地的蒋特武装“自卫团”、“还乡团”，镇压了两个最坏的恶霸，从此奸霸地主再也不敢“倒地”“倒粮”了。群众深刻的认识了自己的武装力量，主动帮助带路侦察，连过去少数反对我们的地主，在遭受蒋伪的蹂躏后，也要求人民武装不要走。直接威胁济宁敌伪的济（宁）嘉（祥）金（乡）鱼（台）敌后游击根据地，在斗争中一天天的壮大起来了。
