    [Report from our newspaper in Wei County, 22nd] The army and people of Southern Hebei have entered the war with passionate emotions. The wartime service command headquarters, with Wang Guanghua, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, as Commander, and Wang Renzhong, Deputy Director of the Administrative Office, as Political Commissar, was established a few days ago. The command headquarters of various counties in Western Fuyang have all begun work. All commanders and fighters of the × Regiment of the Ninth Military Sub-district swore to Chairman Mao: "Resolutely defend Southern Hebei and share life and death with the people of Southern Hebei." In order to repel the invasion of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the masses in the third and fourth districts of Jize, village cadres worked day and night, going deep into each household to carry out war mobilization. In the fourth district, all forty-four villages are prepared for war, every family is storing grain, and the war preparation task has been completed within ten days. The war preparation work in Liu Shuangta, the third district, has been completed. Now the militia is stepping up military training, learning how to throw grenades and shoot, and the self-defense team is on guard and patrol, strictly preventing special agents from infiltrating. The Qinghe militia has eliminated the invading troops and has rushed to the front line to participate in war service work. After receiving the war preparation instructions from the Military Committee of the sub-district, the Guangzong militia immediately assembled two backbone companies to maintain rear area security and stand by for departure. The Party School of the Southern Hebei District Party Committee is learning and working hard in a combat posture. The whole school guarantees that each person saves one or two liang of rice and one yuan every day. The comrades of the guard and communication class donated all forty kilograms of hemp and 1,700 yuan of Hebei currency they produced to the front line. They do not receive heating expenses and collect firewood themselves. Now the whole school is fully preparing for combat in order to meet the combat situation.
