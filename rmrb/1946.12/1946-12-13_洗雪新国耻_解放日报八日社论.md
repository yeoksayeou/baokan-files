The Yan'an community's commemoration of the "December 9th" and "December 21st" congresses passed resolutions of historical significance, designating the day the US-Chiang Commercial Treaty was signed, November 4th, as National Humiliation Day, demanding severe punishment for the masterminds behind the signing of the traitorous treaty, and calling on the nation's youth and compatriots to fight to wash away this new national humiliation. It is very necessary and timely that the "December 21st" congress, which commemorates the great festival of the Chinese youth patriotic movement "December 9th" and inherits the "December 9th" spirit, passed such a resolution. We believe that this resolution will be enthusiastically supported by the vast number of young people and patriotic compatriots across the country.

The basic task of the "December 9th" movement was to unite the strength of the entire nation to resist Japan and strive for the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation. The War of Resistance that was promoted by the "December 9th" movement, after eight years of bloodshed and sacrifice by the Chinese people, finally achieved final victory. Japanese imperialism was defeated! The marks of shame that Japanese imperialism and internal national scum had inflicted on the Chinese nation—the Twenty-One Demands, the Shanghai Truce Agreement, the Tanggu Truce Agreement, etc.—were all washed away! However, not long after the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people discovered that the task of striving for China's independence and freedom, which was put forward by the young students in the "December 9th" movement, had not yet been completed. Because Chiang Kai-shek was willing to be an imperial son of American imperialism, and did not hesitate to sell out his country in exchange for the US reactionaries' assistance to his dictatorial civil war, China is now facing a new disaster of becoming an American colony. The US-Chiang Commercial Treaty is an important symbol of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous behavior. Through this commercial treaty, Chiang Kai-shek auctioned off all of China's territorial sovereignty and the Chinese nation's right to survival, the scope of which is broad and the conditions harsh, exceeding the Twenty-One Demands; and this commercial treaty is only part of the publicly announced content of the US-Chiang secret agreements. For example, as stated in the notice of the Yan'an community's memorial meeting: if the US-Chiang Commercial Treaty "is allowed to be implemented, our country will inevitably face national subjugation and genocide." But the great Chinese nation is determined to fight to the end for its survival and independence and freedom, just as the "December 9th" movement demonstrated the Chinese nation's determination to die rather than be slaves of the Japanese. Today, the nation's patriotic youth and compatriots will commemorate "December 9th" with a pledge to die rather than be American slaves, to resolutely oppose the US-Chiang Commercial Treaty that will lead to national subjugation and genocide, and to resolutely wash away the new national humiliation.

Can the Chinese people wash away the new national humiliation? Our answer is absolutely affirmative. The glorious deeds of the "December 9th" movement tell us that the great strength of the Chinese people is irresistible. Looking back eleven years ago, when the Chiang Kai-shek government was humiliatingly retreating step by step in the face of the Japanese invaders, it used all its strength to suppress and eliminate the people's anti-Japanese army and the anti-Japanese movement. However, when the people could no longer tolerate the reactionary authorities' traitorous behavior, thousands of students in Peiping rushed to the streets, running around and calling for help, and the national salvation movement immediately spread throughout the country, finally breaking through the Chiang government's heavy oppression and realizing the sacred War of Resistance, and achieving the victory of the War of Resistance. Today, the strength of the Chinese people is several times greater than it was eleven years ago. Eleven years ago, the people in only one corner of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia had established their own new democratic political power, and the people's army led by the Communist Party was only tens of thousands of people; but today's liberated areas are all over North China, Central China, and the Northeast, with a population of 140 million, and the regular People's Liberation Army has 1.5 million. In terms of the whole country, the patriotic united front that opposes American imperialism's interference, opposes Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war, and strives for independence, democracy, and peace, its scope is broad and its level of awareness is high, exceeding the anti-Japanese united front of eleven years ago. The military, economic, and political crises facing Chiang Kai-shek's rule are even deeper than they were eleven years ago. In fact, Chiang Kai-shek's supporter, American imperialism, is in unprecedented isolation, and internal economic panic will soon arrive, while the world's democratic forces are unprecedentedly high. Therefore, the Chinese people have full confidence to shatter the US-China reactionaries' plan to turn China into an American colony. In the past, the Chinese people washed away the national humiliation caused by the Twenty-One Demands, the Shanghai Truce Agreement, the Tanggu Truce Agreement, and the He-Umezu Agreement with their heroic struggle. In the future, the Chinese people must continue their efforts to wash away the new national humiliation caused by the US-Chiang Commercial Treaty, punish the masterminds behind the signing of the traitorous treaty, and realize the unfinished task of the "December 9th" movement—to establish an independent, free, and peaceful New China.

    洗雪新国耻
    解放日报八日社论
    延安各界纪念“一二九”“一二一”大会通过了一个个历史意义的决议，规定十一月四日蒋美商约签订的日子为国耻日，要求严惩签订卖国条约的罪魁，并号召全国青年和同胞为洗雪这一新国耻而奋斗。为了纪念中国青年爱国运动的伟大节日“一二九”，和继承“一二九”精神的“一二一”大会通过这样一个决议是非常必要和切合时宜的，我们相信这一决议一定会得到全国广大青年和爱国同胞的热烈拥护。
    “一二九”运动的基本任务就是团结全民族的力量一致抗日，争取中华民族的独立自由。“一二九”所推动起来的抗战，经过中国人民的八年流血牺牲，终于取得了最后的胜利。日本帝国主义被打倒了！日本帝国主义和中国内部民族败类加在中华民族身上的耻辱烙印——二十一条、淞沪协定、塘沽协定等都被洗雪掉了！但是中国人民在抗战胜利不久以前，就发现了在“一二九”运动中青年学生所提出来的争取中国独立自由的任务还没有完成。由于蒋介石甘愿做美国帝国的儿皇帝，不惜出卖祖国以换取美国反动派对他独裁内战的援助，今天中国正面临着变成美国殖民地的新灾难，美蒋商约正是蒋介石这种卖国行为的重要标志。蒋介石经过这个商约拍卖了全中国的领土主权和中华民族的生存权利，其范围之广，条件之苛，超过了二十一条；而这个商约还仅仅是蒋美密约中公开宣布的一部分。例如延安各界纪念大会通知所说：如果蒋美商约“任其实施，则我国非至亡国灭种不可”。但是伟大的中华民族是要坚决为自己的生存和独立自由奋斗到底的，正如“一二九”运动表现了中华民族誓死不当日本亡国奴的决心，今天全国爱国青年和同胞将以誓死不做美国亡国奴，誓死反对亡国灭种的蒋美商约，誓死洗雪新国耻来纪念“一二九”。
    中国人民能不能洗雪新国耻，我们的回答是绝对肯定的。“一二九”运动的光荣事迹告诉我们中国人民的伟大力量是不可抗拒的。回想十一年前蒋介石政府在对日寇侵略节节屈辱步步退让之际，把它的全部力量用来镇压和消灭人民的抗日军队和抗日运动。然而当人民对反动当局的卖国行为忍无可忍的时候，北平数千学生冲到街上，奔走呼号，救亡运动立即弥漫全国，终于冲破了蒋政府的重重压迫而实现了神圣的抗日战争，并取得了抗战的胜利。今天中国人民的力量较诸十一年前不知道要大好几倍，在十一年前仅有陕甘宁一隅之地的人民建立了自己的新民主主义政权，而共产党领导的人民军队还不过数万人；而今天的解放区遍于华北、华中、东北，拥有一万万四千万的人口，正规军的人民解放军则有一百五十万，就全国来说，反对美帝国主义干涉，反对蒋介石独裁内战，争取独立民主和平的爱国主义的统一战线，其范围之广，其觉悟程度之高，亦超过十一年前的抗日统一战线。蒋介石统治所面临的军事上、经济上、和政治上的危机，更较十一年前为深。就实际上说，蒋介石的支持者美国帝国主义陷于空前孤立，加以内部经济恐慌不久就会到来，而世界民主势力则空前高涨。因此中国人民有充分的信心来粉碎中美反动派把中国变成美国的殖民地的计划。中国人民在过去曾以自己的英勇奋斗洗雪了二十一条、淞沪协定、塘沽协定、何梅协定所造成的国耻。今后中国人民一定要再接再厉洗雪蒋美商约所造成的新国耻，征办签订卖国条约的罪魁，实现“一二九”的未竟任务——建立独立自由与和平的新中国。
