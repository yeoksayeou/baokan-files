Write Songs That Soldiers Love to Sing!
    Everyone Discusses
    Having returned from the front, I feel that the lack of good songs for soldiers to sing is a very important problem in the life of the troops, and it's a common reflection. I'm bringing it up in the hope that comrades who care about life on the front lines will work together to solve it.
    But, "What kind of songs do soldiers love to sing?" is a question worth studying. According to my understanding, the songs that soldiers love to sing, in terms of content (that is, the lyrics), should be specific, vivid, and easy to understand. They want to sing about what they do, such as descriptions of their daily life, which they find particularly relatable. The reason why "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" is so popular among soldiers and never gets old is that it has specific and clear content. Today, they demand and love to link songs to the patriotic self-defense war, singing about battles, singing about heroes, singing about the victory of the self-defense war, and even cursing the enemy heartily. They demand to sing these magnificent songs that can inspire patriotic sentiments.
    In terms of melody (melody and rhythm), it should be simple, bright, light, and lively, easy to sing and pleasant to listen to, and also suitable for singing while marching. Because singing in coordination with footsteps makes it particularly energetic. This point needs special attention when writing songs for soldiers.
    Currently, "cultural activities to comfort the troops" are being carried out. Whether my small suggestion is right or not, I hope everyone will criticize it. I hope that comrades engaged in musical work will create more to meet the requirements of the vast number of soldiers!

　　写战士们爱唱的歌子！
    大家谈
    我从前方回来，感到战士们没有好歌子唱，这是部队生活中一个很重要的问题，也是普遍的反映，我提出来，希望关心前线生活的同志们，大家一起来解决。
    但是，“战士们爱唱些什么歌子？”这个问题是值得研究的，据我的了解，战士们爱唱的歌子，在内容方面（也就是歌词），要具体，生动，通俗易懂，他们要求做什么，唱什么，如描写他们日常生活的，唱起来就感到特别亲切。“三大纪律，八项注意”之所以能受到战士们的欢迎，而且百唱不厌，就在于它有具体明确的内容。在今天，他们更要求和爱国自卫战争连系起来，歌唱战斗，歌唱英雄，歌唱自卫战争的胜利，甚至要痛快地骂骂敌人。他们要求唱这些能激发爱国情绪的雄壮的歌子。
    在曲调方面（旋律和节奏），要简单，明快，轻松，活泼，唱起来顺口、好听，而且还要适合在行进中歌唱。因为一面唱，一面和步伐相配合，唱起来就格外起劲。给战士们作歌，这一点须特别照顾到。
    目前“文化劳军”正在开展，我的这个小小意见对与不对，希望大家批评。更希望从事音乐工作的同志们多多创作，来满足广大战士们的要求！
