Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 7th. More than 400 Yan's soldiers liberated by the Eighth Route Army have formed a "Liberation Battalion" and are about to go to the self-defense battlefield to resist the Yan army's invasion. In the liberation battles of Pucheng and Xi County, more than 80% of the 2,500 Yan's soldiers captured were "National Soldiers" conscripted under the "soldier-peasant unity" tyranny. According to Wu Zhentu, a soldier of the 25th Security Regiment, "All the proceeds from labor at home have been plundered by Yan Xishan, and my old mother and wife are crying from hunger and cold, so as soon as I met the Eighth Route Army, I surrendered my gun." On the 21st of last month, during the battle in the suburbs of Daning, Zhang Wanlin, the Yan's company commander guarding the bunker, did not fire a single shot when the Eighth Route Army arrived, and surrendered all his rifles and machine guns.

　　蒲隰罢战阎军掉转枪口抗阎
    【新华社晋绥七日电】四百余八路军解放之阎军士兵，已组成“解放营”即将奔赴自卫战场，抗击阎军的进犯。蒲城隰县解放战中被俘之两千五百阎军士兵百分之八十以上，为“兵农合一”暴政下被抓来之“国民兵”，据保安二十五团士兵武振图称：“家中劳动所得，全被阎锡山掠夺净尽，老母妻子啼饥号寒，故一遇八路军即缴枪”。上月二十一日大宁城郊战斗时，守碉堡之阎军连长张万林，在八路军到来时，一枪未发，即缴出全部步机枪。
