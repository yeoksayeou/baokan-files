  　Seven Battles, Seven Victories Against Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Troops
  　Advanced into Yucheng, Southern Henan, and Annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek Fifth Special Commissioner's Office Training Team
    [Report from our Jilu Yu Frontline Reporters Group on the 5th] From the 27th of last month to the 2nd of this month, our local corps in the Yu Su Wan area achieved seven victories in seven battles, annihilating a platoon of the Chiang Kai-shek security regiment in Fuyang (northern Anhui), most of the Third Security Brigade of the Fifth Special Commissioner's Office, and a squad of local bully Zhang Shengtai. We destroyed one reactionary town and one township public office. In total, we killed over 20 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers below the rank of platoon leader and captured over 170 enemy soldiers, including a deputy company commander and squad leaders. We seized 98 long and short guns, over 2,000 rounds of ammunition, one telephone, and one bicycle. We suffered no casualties.
    Our guerrilla corps in the Yu Su Wan area, deep behind Chiang Kai-shek's troops south of the Longhai Railway, has been even more actively attacking. On the 19th of last month, we captured Zaoziji, 40 li west of Hao County, in one fell swoop, completely annihilating the reactionary armed forces such as the Fifth Company of the Chiang Kai-shek Hao County Security Brigade stationed there. We captured over 400 enemy soldiers below the rank of captain and seized over 300 rifles, over 20 pistols, and over 10,000 rounds of ammunition. We only suffered three minor injuries.
    On the 1st of this month, one of our guerrilla corps advanced to Baima Temple, more than ten li east of Yucheng County in southern Henan, and ambushed the Second Company of the First Detachment of the Training Corps of the Fifth Special Commissioner's Office of the Chiang Kai-shek army, killing one enemy platoon leader and one squad leader, and capturing 52 people below the rank of company commander.
    [Another dispatch] On the 1st of this month, at Yuseji, 40 li west of Jinxiang, we annihilated the second district office, town office, and township office of the reactionary district in Chengwu, killing and wounding over 40 Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers and capturing over 90, seizing over 150 rifles, three light machine guns, and many other military supplies. On the morning of the 29th of last month, one of our units annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek "Homecoming Corps" stationed in Yiqi, 15 li east of Dongming, capturing 24 Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers and seizing seven long and short guns and two warhorses.
