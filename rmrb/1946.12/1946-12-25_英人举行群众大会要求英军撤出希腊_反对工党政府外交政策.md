    Demanding British Troops Withdraw from Greece
    Opposing the Labour Government's Foreign Policy
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 22nd: According to a TASS dispatch from London, a mass meeting was held in Bagshot Dahl, South London on December 16th, which passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of British troops from Greece. Babbage, a member of the Central Standing Committee of the Trades Union Congress, Lord Strabolgi, a Labour peer, and Dodds, a Labour MP, all delivered speeches at the meeting. Babbage declared: "I see no difference between the foreign policy of the Labour government and that of the Churchill government. We (referring to the Labour government) are implementing the policies formulated by the Conservatives and the Conservative diplomats in the Foreign Office." Dodds declared: "We are responsible for everything that is happening in Greece. I am convinced that our foreign policy is completely wrong." Dodds believes that Bevin is influenced by such figures in the Foreign Office, who not only hate the Soviet Union but also hate the Labour Party. Dodds declared that a situation is also forming in opposition to such people.

　　英人举行群众大会
    要求英军撤出希腊
    反对工党政府外交政策
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据塔斯社伦敦电，十二月十六日南伦敦之巴格士汤达尔举行群众大会，通过决议，要求英军自希腊撤退。职工大会中央常务委员会委员巴布华斯、工党上院议员斯特拉波勋爵、工党下院议员多兹，俱会上发表演说。巴布华斯宣称：“在工党政府与邱吉尔政府的外交政策之间，我看不到任何差异。我们（指工党政府）正在执行保守党人及外交部中保守党外交家所制定之政策。”多兹宣称：“我们对在希腊所发生的一切，均负有责任。我深信我们的外交政策完全错误。”多兹认为：贝文为外交部中的此种人物所影响，此种人不仅憎恨苏联，而且憎恨工党。多兹宣告，反对此种人的情势也正在形成中。
