(Xinhua News Agency, Central China, December 12th) Last month, Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division, during its invasion of Lianshui, actually used American-made chemical rifle grenades. The burn wounds glowed with phosphorus and were clearly visible in the dark, and the flames could continue for two or three days. After research, the following effective treatment method has been developed: The wounded should be treated urgently. First, disinfect the wound; then apply gauze soaked in a 2% copper sulfate solution to neutralize the phosphorus fire; then apply a 2% gentian violet solution. If on the battlefield, gauze soaked in ordinary disinfectant or boiled water can be temporarily used to cover the wound, so that the phosphorus fire is isolated from the air and cannot burn. After the wounded are transported to the dressing station or rear hospital, they can be treated according to the above method. However, it should be noted that oil-based ointments should not be used, as phosphorus can dissolve oil and promote damage to the skin and body tissues, resulting in greater injury.

    蒋贼使用美造化学枪榴弹
    华中创造弹伤疗法
    【新华社华中十二日电】上月蒋军七十四师于进犯涟水之战中，竟使用美造化学枪榴弹，弹伤处即现磷光，黑暗中清晰可辨，燃火可继续两三天之久。经研究治疗良法如下：伤员应予急治。先将伤口清毒；然后敷以醮有百分之二硫酸铜溶夜之纱布，即可将磷火中和；再后搽以百分之二的龙胆糊溶液。若在战场上，临时可用纱布醮普通消毒药水或开水敷盖伤口，使磷火隔绝空气不能燃烧，待伤员运至包扎所或后方医院，即可照上法疗治。但需注意，不能用油膏料，因磷能溶解油膏，助长侵害皮肤及人体组织，招致更大损伤。
