    Trusteeship Council Decides to
    Convene People's Representative Conference in Trust Territories
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 12th】Chenggong Lake News: The work of the United Nations General Assembly Trusteeship Council has recently made new progress. On the 9th, it decided to convene regional representative conferences of local people in non-self-governing territories under trusteeship, so that the local people have the opportunity to express their wishes. This motion was originally proposed by the Philippine representative, and later amended and passed by the Soviet representative. The amendment stipulates that this meeting should be convened by the Economic and Social Council, not initiated by the trustee state as proposed by the Indian side. All trustee states opposed this proposal, but ultimately failed to prevent its passage. Some observers believe this is the first defeat of the trustee countries in the committee. Previously, the work of the committee was repeatedly hindered by trustee countries, who demanded the right to establish military bases in various trust territories without the approval of the Security Council, and strongly opposed the formulation of any mandatory decisions to modify the trusteeship agreements they had signed. The Soviet representative criticized this colonial policy at the meeting and was supported by South Africa, India, Iraq, and other countries, but it was passed due to the joint vote of the trustees and their followers. The request by South Africa to merge the mandated territory of Southwest Africa was severely attacked by the Indian representative and others, who demanded a resolution to prevent South Africa from merging and to place the territory under international trusteeship. Ultimately, due to the compromise of the US representative, it was only stated that a merger was temporarily inappropriate, effectively delaying a decision. It is expected that the various decisions passed in the committee will be debated again at the General Assembly.

    托管委员会决定
    召开托管区人民代表会
    【新华社延安十二日电】成功湖讯：联合国大会托管委员会工作近有新进展。于九日决定在被托管的非自治区域召开当地人民的区域代表会议，俾当地人民有表达其意愿的机会。此议案原为菲律滨代表所提，后经苏联代表加以修正通过。修正者为此项会非如印方所提由托管国家发起，而是经由经济社会理事会召集，所有托管国家均反对此提案，惟终未得逞。若干观察家认为此为委员会中各托管国之首次挫败，前此该委员会工作屡受托管国家诸多阻碍，他们曾要求有权在各托管地区建立军事基地，而无须经安理会批准。并极力反对制定任何修改他们所订之托管协定的强制性决定。苏联代表曾在会上抨击此种殖民地政策，并受南、印、伊拉克等国支持，然因托管员及其追随者联合投票竟被通过。南非所提合并西南非洲委任统治地之要求，受印代表等严厉攻击，要求决议不准南非合并，并将该地置于国际托管之下。卒因美代表折衷而仅称暂不宜合并，实则拖延不决。委员会中所通过之各项决定，预期将在大会上再展开辩论。
