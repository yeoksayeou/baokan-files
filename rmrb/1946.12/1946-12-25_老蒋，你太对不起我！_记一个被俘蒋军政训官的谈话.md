　　"Old Chiang, You Have Failed Me!"
    A Conversation with a Captured KMT Political Training Officer
    Cai Gongdi
    Major Zhang, a political training officer in the Kuomintang army captured during the Ping-Han Campaign, had a frank conversation with me the other night. He said, "Old Cai, to be honest, when I was captured, I made up my mind not to let the Communist Party 'redden' me. No matter how good the Communist Party says they are, it's all snake oil; no matter how well they do, it's all tricks. I am a loyal believer in Chairman Chiang, and I absolutely cannot let the Communist Party 'redden' me. But now, after more than a year, from many facts, I have indeed seen that the Communist Party does better than the Kuomintang, and does it right. Therefore, I have come to believe in the Communist Party, but I don't know if I have been 'reddened' myself! As the saying goes, 'Don't be afraid of not knowing the goods, just be afraid of comparing goods.' Let's take fighting as an example. In the past, over there, when we heard about fighting, we secretly rejoiced and said, 'When the cannons fire, gold is abundant, let's fight! Let's fight!' In the fighting, we could take the opportunity to loot the property of the common people. Other than that, everything else was nonsense. Here, when I was captured, I saw with my own eyes a soldier of the Eighth Route Army charging towards our camp, shouting to his comrades, 'Don't be afraid to die, if we don't capture the machine gun, if we don't complete the Party's mission, we will not return even in death!' As a result, the machine gun of our camp was captured. After the battle, I saw many officers and soldiers coming down from the front line. Besides being loaded with spoils of war like guns and ammunition, I couldn't see a single soldier with captured gold rings or watches. What good discipline, what a good army!

    "Over there, the issue of women was terrible. As long as there were four hours of rest during encampment, incidents of messing with women were bound to happen. The officers did it and then pretended to be saints to reprimand their subordinates. Who would dare to say anything? Here, not to mention the Eighth Route Army, even our group of captured officers and soldiers are being educated to have morals. Once, a backward guy visited someone else's room, and the Eighth Route Army gave him a good education.

    "Over there, two sentences were popular: 'If you don't embezzle, you're not an official, no official doesn't embezzle,' the more corrupt the official, the faster they were promoted. Coming here, everything I see is clean and honest. To give a simple example, there was a director who, when distributing allowances, could afford to smoke cigarettes for the first ten days, then only could afford to smoke pipe tobacco for the middle ten days, and then wouldn't smoke at all for the last ten days, sometimes even borrowing money from the 'young devils.' The Eighth Route Army's hard work and integrity for the sake of the people has greatly moved me, who has always been accustomed to corruption. I have also turned over a new leaf.

    "Over there, eating, drinking, gambling, whoring, boasting, hanging pictures of beautiful women in the room, carrying erotic pictures in the pocket, writing love letters with fountain pens, copying 'Eighteen Touches,'... this is the typical life of a general officer. Here, we live every day studying, reading newspapers, talking, attending meetings, and looking at war maps, playing poker and other pastimes. In the room are written slogans such as 'Be a model in work,' 'Study hard,' 'Love the masses, love the soldiers,' which are the direction of everyone's actions. Every day we work, getting up before dawn and going to bed late at night. I affirm that this spirit of hard work for the cause of the people's liberation will surely be victorious.

    "In the past, when Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government passed away, the superiors ordered us to 'mourn and grieve to show solemnity.' Zhang, the battalion commander of my camp, did the best and was praised by the brigade commander, but heaven knows that although his tears flowed a lot, it was the result of wiping off half a box of Golden Oil. Because what did Lin Sen's death have to do with them! But when we recently held a memorial service for the 'April 8th' martyrs here, I saw with my own eyes in the venue that the entire audience of soldiers and civilians cried bitterly. Old revolutionaries cried more tears than new revolutionaries, and their eyes were more red and swollen. Why did they cry like that? Because they knew why they were crying, just like what they wrote on the elegiac couplets: 'Crying for the loss of a genius leader for the entire Party and the entire country,' 'Crying for the disaster-ridden Chinese people,' 'Crying for the misfortune in the middle of building a new China.' I am the most unsentimental person with a heart of stone, but on that day I couldn't help but shed tears.

    "Over there, when they heard the name 'Chairman Chiang,' they would stand at attention. In fact, we often discussed: President Chiang is 'Chiang Zhongcai (zhongcai means to win the lottery and get rich), Chairman Chiang thinks of 'Chiang Weirenzhuang' (can become an official), Chairman Chiang thinks of 'Chiang Chuxi' (eating and drinking heartily), Chiang Chung-cheng thinks of 'Chiang Zhongchen' (following Old Chiang has no way out, he is bound to sink); here the respect for Chairman Mao, don't talk about the Party, government, and army. Let's just talk about the peasants, I have walked through many rural areas and seen that many farmhouses hang portraits of the leader, next to the portraits are also pasted couplets: 'Eating rice, don't forget Chairman Mao, to turn over, rely on Commander-in-Chief.' From this, it can be seen their sincere support for the people's leader.

    "Over there, when the common people saw soldiers, it was like sheep seeing wolves, being beaten a few times and scolded was still considered a great blessing. Over there, the common people also provide meals, it looks like they prepare a few dishes and are very respectful, but in fact, the common people hate us to the core. Once, I was eating a meal provided in a family in Xinzhuang, and I smelled a strong urine smell in the food. Over there, the common people don't dare to openly resist, they will secretly resist. Here, I once went with a cadre named Zhang to eat a meal provided in Li Jiabao, the old man asked us how many miles we had walked today, we answered that we had walked ninety miles, the old man said: Comrades, you have worked too hard, are you hungry, rest, I am afraid that cooking will not be on time, after saying that he left. Not long after, he brought back a basket of fried dough sticks, noodles, and lamb buns and told us to eat, we refused again and again, the old man was anxious, and asked repeatedly: 'Are the Eighth Route Army and the common people a family? If you don't eat, you are not a family?' We ate with full of gratitude, but we didn't finish eating, the old man insisted on letting us pack it up, forcefully stuffing it into our pockets with his hands. At that time, I was very moved, in ancient and modern times, there is no example of the common people having such a relationship with the army.

    "Recently, I often think: 'Have I been reddened?' Once, I asked a captured colleague, he said: 'Probably we seem to be reddened!' After hearing this, I thought to myself, if I have really been reddened, then let it be reddened! 'Chairman Chiang'! Don't blame me for failing you, I, who was once your loyal believer, have to blame you for failing me and countless kind people!"

　　“老蒋，你太对不起我！”
    记一个被俘蒋军政训官的谈话
    蔡公狄
    张少校，是平汉战役俘过来的一个国民党军中的政训官，前天晚上他和我作了一次畅谈，他说：“老蔡呀，老实说当我被俘的时候，我就下了决心，不让共产党赤化。不管共产党说得怎样好，都是卖狗皮膏药；不管做得怎样好，都是耍手段，我是蒋委员长的忠实信徒，反正我不能让共产党赤化。但到现在已有一年多，从许多事实中确实看到共产党做得比国民党好、做得对，因此我也就相信了共产党，但不知道自己究竟赤化了没有！？俗话说：“不怕不识货，只怕货比货，”先拿打仗来说吧，我们过去在那边一听打仗就暗自高兴说：“大炮一响，黄金万两，打吧！打吧！在打仗中，可乘机大搜大抢老百姓的财物，除此以外，别的都扯蛋。在这里我被俘时，亲眼看到一位八路军的士兵向我营冲来，口里向他们同志喊道：“不要怕死，夺不下机枪，完不成党的任务，死也不回去”，这样的结果，我营的机枪都被夺了。战斗下来，我看了许多从火线下来的官兵，身上除载满胜利品枪械弹药外，再也看不到那一个兵有俘虏的金戒指或手表的，真是好纪律，好队伍！
    “在那边对女人问题可就坏透啦，只要有四个钟头休息宿营，那就非发生搞女人的事件不成。长官搞了，还装圣人来训斥部下，谁敢吭呢？在这里不要说八路军，就是我们这一群俘虏官兵，都被管教得有道德了，有一次一个落后家伙，串了一次门子，八路军对他好好教育了一番。
    “在那边，流行两句话：‘不贪不算官，当官无不贪’，越贪的官越升得快。到这里来，所见的都是清廉的，随便举一件事来说，有一个主任，发津贴的时候，头十天可以抽纸烟，中十天那就只能抽旱烟了，到下十天那就不抽烟了，有时还向“小鬼”借钱。八路军这样为了人民艰苦清廉，使向来贪污成习的我，感动很大，我也浪子回头了。
    “在那边吃、喝、赌、嫖、吹、房里挂美人画，口袋里装春宫图，自来水笔写情书，抄‘十八摸’，……这就是一般军官的生活写照。这里每天生活读书、看报、谈话、开会看战图，打扑克等消遣。房里写着，‘工作中做模范’，‘努力学习’，‘爱护群众，爱护士兵’等标语口号，就是大家行动的方向，每天工作，起五更睡半夜，这样为人民解放事业苦干的精神，我肯定的说，一定会胜利。
    “过去，国民政府，林森主席逝世的时候，上边命令我们都要‘哭丧痛悼，以示隆重’，我营张营长做得最好，受到旅长口奖，可是天知道，他的泪虽流得多，是抹掉半盒万金油的结果。因为林森死了与他们有什么屁相干呢！但当这里前些时追悼‘四八’烈士时，我在会场上亲眼看到，全场军民大哭，老革命比新革命哭得泪更多，眼睛更红肿，他们为什么哭成那样呢？因为他们知道为什么要哭，就像他们挽词上所写的：‘为全党全国失去天才领袖而哭’，‘为多灾多难的中国人民而哭’，‘为建立新中国中途的不幸而哭’，我是个最不会哭的铁石心肠的人，但在那天也不自禁的涕泪纵横了。
    “在那里听到‘蒋委员长’名字，都立正，其实我们常议论着：蒋总裁是‘蒋中彩，（中彩要发大财），蒋委员长认为‘蒋委任状’（可以做官），蒋主席认为‘蒋除夕’（大吃大喝）蒋中正认为‘蒋终沉’（跟老蒋没有出路，非沉不成）；在这里对毛主席的尊敬，党、政、军就不要谈了。光农民来说吧，我走过不少农村，看到农家多挂着领袖像，像旁还贴有对子：‘吃饭不忘毛主席，翻身要靠总司令’。从这可见他们对人民领袖的诚心拥戴了。
    “在那边老百姓见了兵就像羊见了狼，被打两下，骂一顿还算是万福。在那边老百姓也派饭，看起来弄几个菜，很尊敬，其实老百姓对我们恨透了，有一次我在辛庄一家吃派饭，闻到饭菜里有一股强烈的尿臊味。在那边老百姓不敢明反抗，就会暗反抗的。在这里，我曾跟一个张干事到李家堡派饭吃，那老乡问我们今天走了多少路，我们答走了九十里，那老乡说：同志们呀，你们太辛苦了，肚饥了吧，歇歇吧，我现在做饭恐赶不上，说完就走了。不多一刻，就提回一筐油条、面饼，还有羊肉包子叫我们吃，我们再三推却，那老乡倒急了，连问：‘八路军与老百姓是不是一家人？你不吃就不是一家人了？’我们以满腔感谢的心情吃了，但没吃完，那老乡还非让我们装上不成，用手强塞在我们口袋里。当时我很感动，古今中外没有看见老百姓对军队有这样的关系。
    “近来我时常想：‘我赤化了没有呢？’一次，我问过被俘同事，他说：‘大概我们好像是赤化了吧！’我听了后，心想如果真的赤化了，那就让他赤化吧！‘蒋委员长’！不要怪我对不起你，曾经是你的忠实信徒的我，却要怪你太对不起我和无数善良的人民了！”
