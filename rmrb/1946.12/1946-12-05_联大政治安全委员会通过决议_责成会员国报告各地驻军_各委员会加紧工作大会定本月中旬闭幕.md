　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 2nd: According to the Associated Press, the United Nations General Assembly Political and Security Committee concluded its discussion on the Soviet proposal to report on troops stationed in various countries on the 28th. The committee passed a decision recommending that the UN General Assembly instruct member states to report on the status of their troops and military installations worldwide, including not only troops stationed abroad, but also domestic troops. The Soviet Union has agreed to the British proposal for an international inspection system, which was strongly opposed by the United States.
    [Another Dispatch] Currently, the committees of the United Nations General Assembly are intensifying their work in order to complete the preliminary plans for discussion of various proposals by the 5th of this month. This session of the General Assembly is scheduled to close in mid-month.
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] Compiling reports from various sources: During the United Nations General Assembly Political and Security Committee's discussion of the Soviet proposal to investigate troops stationed abroad, British representative Bevin withdrew his original proposal (to merge the investigation of stationed troops with the general disarmament issue) at the meeting on the 25th, and proposed several amendments to the Soviet proposal. One was that the scope of the report should include all domestic and foreign troops; the second was to establish an inspection system to check the authenticity of the reports submitted by various countries; and the third was that countries should submit troop reports before January 1st of next year. The British representative's new proposal came after the Czech representative called for endorsement of the Soviet proposal. When US representative Connally spoke, he strongly opposed the establishment of an inspection system proposed by Bevin, believing that this system should be attached to the general disarmament plan to be discussed in the future.
    Molotov, at the meeting on the 26th, agreed to the date for reporting troops proposed by the British side. At the same time, Molotov reiterated the original Soviet proposal, that the Soviet Union agreed to provide information on domestic troops, but only when discussing the entire disarmament plan. Molotov continued that when the Security Council reviews the issue of universal disarmament in the future, member states should provide information on all types of weapons, including jet-propelled aircraft, rockets, and atomic weapons. US representative Connally still insisted that the scope of the report should include domestic troops, and reiterated the US opposition to the inspection system. Regarding atomic weapons, Connally said that the US attitude has been shown in the Baruch Plan (note: this plan actually guarantees the US monopoly of the atomic bomb). British representative Bevin then reiterated the necessity of establishing an inspection system to assess the authenticity of the information on domestic and foreign troops submitted by various countries. Regarding Molotov's suggestion that countries should provide information on various weapons, Bevin said: "After the progress of the disarmament agreement is sufficient to guarantee security, Britain will, like the Soviet Union, be willing to report on this special event." French representative Parodi, in his speech, reiterated his support for the Soviet proposal, believing that "if the original Soviet proposal is adopted, it will definitely achieve some practical results."

　　联大政治安全委员会通过决议
  　责成会员国报告各地驻军
  　各委员会加紧工作大会定本月中旬闭幕
    【新华社延安二日电】据美联社讯：联合国大会政治安全委员会关于苏联所提报告各国军队建议的讨论，已于二十八日结束。委员会通过决定，建议联合国大会责成各会员国报告其在全世界各地驻军及军事设备的情况，不仅国外驻军，而且国内军队亦在报告之列。苏联已同意英国所提之国际检查制度的建议，此建议曾为美方竭力反对。
    【又讯】目前联合国大会各委员会正加紧工作，以便在本月五日前完成对各项提案之讨论案预定计划。本届大会将在本月中旬闭幕。
    【新华社讯】综合各方报导：联合国大会政治安全委员会对苏联所提调查驻外军队的讨论时，英代表贝克尔曾于二十五日会议上收回其原来的建议（即将调查驻军问题与一般裁军问题合并一起），而对苏方建议提出若干修改。其一为报告范围包括各国内外军队；其二为建立一检查制度，检查各国所提报告的真实性；其三为各国在明年一月一日以前提出军队报告。英代表这一新建议，是在捷克代表号召赞同苏联提案之后。美代表康纳利发言时，强烈反对贝克尔所提建立检查制度，认为此种制度应附属于将来讨论的普遍裁军计划内。
    莫洛托夫于二十六日会议上，同意英方所提报告军队的日期，同时莫氏又重申苏联的原议，即苏联同意提供国内军队的情报，但仅应在讨论整个裁军计划时提出，苏联调查军队的提议，只包括国外驻军。莫洛托夫继称，在安全理事会将来审议普遍裁军问题时，各会员国应提供各种型式武器的情报，连喷汽推进式飞机、火箭弹及原子武器在内。美代表康纳利仍主报告范围应包括国内军队，并重申美国反对检查制度。至于原子武器，康氏谓美国态度已见诸于巴鲁区所提计划中（按该计划实际是保证美国垄断原子弹）。英代表贝克尔继之重申建立检查制度，以考核各国所提国内外军队情报之必要。对于莫洛托夫所提各国应提供各种武器情报的建议，贝氏说：“在裁军协定之进展足以保障安全后，英国将一如苏联愿将此种专门事件提出报告。”法国代表巴洛第于发言时，重申支持苏联建议，认为“苏方之原议案若经通过，则必可获得若干实际成果”。
