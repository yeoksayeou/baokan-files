　　Xing City Prepares for War Combined with Emancipation
　　[Report from this newspaper, Xingtai] Xingtai City, while preparing for war, is also examining the emancipation of the masses. It has discovered that feudal forces are still strong, and many exploited workers, peasants, and impoverished citizens have not yet been emancipated. Furthermore, many traitors, puppets, and special agents are still operating in the shadows. The main reason for this is the bureaucratic approach of taking everything into one's own hands, failing to let go and mobilize the masses. After self-criticism, a campaign of speaking out about grievances and settling scores was launched. The masses arrested some local tyrants and bullies, and morale soared. Even churchgoers and fortune-tellers were swept up in the movement. A Christian from a Jesus Church on Malu Street said, "I've been chanting scriptures and believing in the Lord for many years, but I've always been poor. I joined the Farmers' Association just a few days ago, and I have a house and land! Believing in the Lord doesn't help; you still have to believe in Chairman Mao!" During a meeting of the masses in the business district, a fortune-teller named Mr. Cui said, "After I am emancipated and have capital, I will change professions and no longer do this fortune-telling business of deceiving people!"

　　邢市备战结合翻身
    【本报邢台讯】邢台市在备战中结合检查群众翻身，发现封建势力仍然强大，被剥削的工农及贫苦市民多未翻身，不少奸伪特务尚暗中活动。主要是因为作风上的包办代替，未能放手发动，经检讨后展开诉苦清算，群众当把一些奸霸分子拘捕，情绪顿形高涨，连教徒算命的都卷入了运动。马路街一个耶稣堂的教徒说：“我念经信主好多年，总是个穷；参加了农会不几天，有了房子有了地！信主顶不了事，还是得信毛主席！”商场群众开会时，一个算命的崔先生说：“翻了身，有了资本我就改行，再不做这行子骗人买卖了！”（刘正一）
