　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: The United Nations General Assembly has begun to accelerate its work. The committees will hold seventy meetings this week, and the plenary session will also be held every night, in order to adjourn in time so that representatives from various countries can return home for Christmas. The General Assembly has now announced that it will adjourn on the 13th.

　　The Political and Security Committee continues to discuss the disarmament issue. The US delegation submitted a disarmament proposal on the 1st. According to the spokesperson of the US delegation, the meaning of this proposal is to abolish the Security Council's control over the entire disarmament plan and make it impossible for the major powers to use the veto power. At the meeting on the 2nd, the US representative said: The United States spent a lot of money in the war and should have a greater say in disarmament. He also emphasized that the control should not be limited to atomic weapons, but should include all destructive weapons. Vyshinsky said in his speech: The huge expenditure of military materials certainly warrants a say, but the loss of millions of people's lives should warrant a greater say. Vyshinsky also said: The purpose of the Soviet and American plans is, first, to ban atomic bombs, and the Soviet plan also stipulates universal disarmament. The committee passed Vyshinsky's proposal to postpone the discussion of the US proposal. The British representative intends to propose the establishment of a small subcommittee to combine the disarmament proposals from all parties into a single plan as much as possible. According to a TASS reporter, some representatives at the meeting attempted to confuse the disarmament issue with the veto issue in order to prevent the resolution of the disarmament issue. According to reports, the five powers did not make any decision on the veto issue after several days of meetings and returned it to the committee. The committee will discuss the veto issue after the disarmament issue.

　　联合国大会加紧进行
    继续讨论裁军问题
  　美代表节外生枝提出新建议
    【新华社延安三日电】成功湖讯：联合国大会已开始加紧工作，本周内各委员会蒋举行七十次会议，全体大会亦于每日夜间举行，以期及时休会，俾各国代表得返国度圣诞节。大会现宣布将于十三日休会。
    政治安全委员会仍继续讨论裁军问题，美代表团于一日提出的裁军建议。据美代表团发言人称：这一建议含意是取消安理会控制整个裁军计划及使各强国使用否决权成为不可能。二日会上，美代表发言时说：美国在战争花了许多钱，应对裁军有更大的发言权，并强调应管制者不以原子武器为限，应包括一切毁灭性的武器。维辛斯基发言时说：军事物资的重大耗费，固然可有发言权，但数百万人民生命之丧失，应有更大的发言权。维氏又称：苏美两国计划的目的，首先，为禁止原子弹，且苏方计划亦规定普遍裁减军备。委员会通过维氏提议，即暂缓讨论美方建议。英代表拟提议成立一小组委员会，尽可能将各方裁军建议合成一单一计划。据塔斯社记者称：会议上有若干代表企图使裁军问题与否决权问题混淆在一起，以阻止裁军问题的解决。按否决权问题五强于数日会议后未作任何决定，即交回该委员会，委员会将于裁军问题之后讨论否决权问题。
