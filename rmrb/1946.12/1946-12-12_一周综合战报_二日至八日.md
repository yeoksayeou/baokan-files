    Weekly Comprehensive War Report
    December 2nd to 8th

    In the Suwan area, the New Fourth Army conducted a brilliant campaign of annihilation south of Yancheng. This campaign is still in progress. In the Jinji-Luyu battlefield, from November 29th to December 6th, although the enemy occupied two of our cities, we recovered three. The enemy's initiative has turned into passivity. On the southern front of Suwan, the Chiang army, which attacked Yancheng from Dongtai, lost 1,000 men on November 30th. From December 6th to 8th, another 3,000+ men were annihilated, and two of their divisions have been surrounded and divided. As the enemy's main force concentrated on the Dongtai line, the New Fourth Army took the opportunity to recover the Hai'an Dong area. People's militia in the Fangong Dyke area of central Jiangsu have eliminated more than 600 Chiang soldiers and recovered seven villages and towns, including Chuan Port (northeast of Haimen) in the past month.

    In the Jinji-Luyu area, although the Chiang army occupied Puyang (November 30th) and Puyang County (December 4th), the Eighth Route Army recovered Puyang County on the 6th and Yuncheng on the 3rd, posing a serious threat to the eastern side of the Chiang army occupying Puyang. The Eighth Route Army also successively recovered Jiyuan (November 29th) and Wen County (December 2nd), as well as many important villages and towns between Qinyang and Wuzhi in northern Henan. These places are the rear of the invading enemy forces, separated from the Chiang side's important garrison points of Zhengzhou and Luoyang by only the Yellow River.

    In Suiyuan, after Fu Zuoyi transferred his main force to the Chahar province for the civil war front, his rear became increasingly empty. After the Eighth Route Army recovered the key town of Datan on the northeast highway of Guihua on November 30th, more than 600 square li in the area have been completely recovered. The Baoziwan Station south of Fengzhen on the Ping-Sui Railway was also raided by the militia. In the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, Chiang's army under Hu Zongnan invaded the Guanzhong sub-district and occupied Liulin Town and other places on the 8th. The Eighth Route Army is resisting. The second district of Yanchi, which was occupied by Ma Hongkui's troops of the Chiang army, has been recovered by the Eighth Route Army.

    一周综合战报
    二日至八日
    苏皖新四军在盐城以南进行了一个光辉的歼灭战役，这个战役尚在进行中，而在晋冀鲁豫战场中，自上月廿九日至本月六日敌占我二城我收复三城，敌之主动已转为被动。在苏皖南线由东台北犯盐城的蒋军，上月三十日一千人就歼之后，本月六日至八日又被消灭三千余人，其两个师已被包围分割，且因当敌人主力集结东台线之际，新四军即乘虚收复海安东××至××一线。苏中范公堤一带民兵，最近一个月内消灭了蒋军六百余人，收复川港（海门东北）等村镇七处。
    晋冀鲁豫方面蒋军虽侵占了濮阳（上月三十日），濮县（四日），但六日八路军即收复了濮县，三日收复了郓城，给予侵占濮阳蒋军的东侧严重的威胁。八路军并接连收复了济源（十一月二十九日）、温县（二日）两城及豫北沁阳、武陟之间的重要村镇多处。这些地方乃进犯敌军的后方，与蒋方重要屯兵点郑州、洛阳仅有黄河一水之隔。
    在绥远傅作义将其主力调往察省内战前线后，其后方益形空虚，八路军于上月三十日收复归绥东北公路上的要镇大滩后，该地区六百多方里已全被收复。平绥路上丰镇以南堡子湾车站也一度被民兵袭入。在陕甘宁边区方面，蒋军胡宗南部进犯关中分区，于八日侵占柳林镇等地，八路军正在阻击中，蒋军马鸿逵部所侵占的盐池二区，已为八路军收复。
