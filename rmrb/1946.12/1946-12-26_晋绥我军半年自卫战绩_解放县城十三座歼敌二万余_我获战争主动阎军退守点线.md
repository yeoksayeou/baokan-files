　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinsui, 23rd—The Jinsui Military Region Headquarters recently announced the Jinsui Eighth Route Army's and local corps' self-defense counterattack achievements in six and a half months (June to mid-December), stating: Yan Xishan continuously invaded our Jin Northwest and Jinzhong Liberated Areas, and the Eighth Route Army was forced to counterattack in self-defense. With the support of the local people, it achieved brilliant results, liberating thirteen county towns including Shuoxian, Huairen, Ningwu, Guoxian, Daixian, Fanshi, Yonghe, Puxian, Daning, Shilou, Xixian, Fenxi, and Zhongyang, as well as over fifty key towns such as Daiyue, Yuanping, Xuangang, Qicun, Yangmingbao, Duijiuyu, Shuitou, and Shikou, linking the Jin Northwest area with the Ji-Jin area and the Jin Northwest area with the Jin Southwest area. The main forces of Yan's army, the 68th Division, 37th Division, 38th Division, 39th Division, 40th Division, and 45th Division, were mostly annihilated or dispersed. When recovering the counties, Yan Xishan's "Security Regiments" and "Love-the-Homeland Regiments" were all disarmed. After losing a large amount of its active forces, Yan's army has shifted from active to passive, and can only be confined to isolated strongholds in the Jinzhong area and along the Tongpu and Zhengtai railway lines; while the Eighth Route Army has become stronger and stronger and has entered into active operations. During this period, the Eighth Route Army's field corps and local corps fought more than 540 times, killing or wounding over 9,900 of Yan's troops, capturing over 12,000 alive, 509 horses, seizing 92 various cannons, 554 light and heavy machine guns, over 7,800 rifles and carbines, over 120 grenade launchers, 8 rifle grenade launchers, over 1 million rounds of ammunition, over 2,000 rounds of artillery shells, over 1,000 rounds of grenade launcher shells, over 17,000 hand grenades, 9 locomotives, and over 30 carriages; and shot down 4 airplanes.
