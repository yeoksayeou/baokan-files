(Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 27th dispatch) Our army launched a widespread guerrilla war in the Jiang-occupied areas to protect the interests of people of all classes; the Jiang army committed acts of rape, plunder, and slaughter on a large scale. The people in the Jiang-occupied areas distinguished between the enemy and ourselves through their own experiences. Many landlords fled to our area with their families and belongings in carts, both large and small. Landlord ×× from Dashe Village in the Eighth District of Changyuan, initially felt that there would be no problem because his relatives were in the "Homecoming Corps." Unexpectedly, his third daughter (seventeen years old) was gang-raped by He Guansan's troops. The whole family was extremely frightened and fled to Puyang. Landlord Zong Bingzhi also abandoned his home and fled because he could not bear the exploitation of the Jiang army. He said, "All my people have moved out, let them have the things and the house." The famous "Dashe Family" She Lanting also abandoned his home and fled to Qingfeng. When someone asked him why he was running to the Liberated Area, he said, "If I don't run here, where else can I run?" Li Xikui, a well-known landlord in Xililou, Juancheng, was robbed clean by the Jiang army, and his son was also conscripted into the army. He fled to Liaoqiao overnight. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the landlords had a deep understanding of the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party. They knew that although the Jiang army had temporarily occupied a few empty cities, they had already lost seventy or eighty thousand people. The Eighth Route Army was getting stronger and stronger and would eventually win. Therefore, although the "Homecoming Corps" repeatedly incited them to take back land from the masses, most landlords were unwilling to be easily fooled. The landlords in Wujie, Sixth District, Yancheng, were wary of each other, saying, "Let's not mess around!" The son of Landlord ×× from Juzhuang, Second District, did not understand the overall situation. Seeing that we had temporarily withdrawn and being instigated by bad elements, he thought he could demand things back from the people. So he pushed the farmer association member ×× to the threshing ground and opened the bean stall to beat him. His elderly father found out, tremblingly ran to the threshing ground, slapped him twice severely, and scolded him, "Are you crazy? Short-sighted, courting death!" He apologized to the family members of the farmer association member, saying, "The child doesn't know anything, don't hold it against him." There were also a few who did not understand the greater good and demanded land and grain from the farmers' association, but they felt panic and unease after our guerrilla team arrived. In ×× districts of Yancheng, some landlords initially took back land from the farmers' association, but soon after seeing the activities of our guerrilla team, they immediately secretly returned the contracts and admitted their mistakes. Our guerrilla warfare has been carried out more widely in Qibin, Heze and other counties, and the militia is strong. Landlords who had served as Jiang-puppet Bao heads and Jia heads surrendered to us one after another. Landlords in Dongming still implemented government decrees, helping the families of soldiers with the autumn harvest and cultivating land on behalf of militiamen who were away from home. Many landlords in Qingfeng expressed to activists, "When the Central Army comes, we will run ahead of you." Many landlords in Shou Zhang held unity meetings with the farmers' association, publicly expressing to the farmers' association that they would not work for the Jiang army and would not sabotage the farmers' association. They said, "Enmities can be resolved, not knotted. We have lived together for generations, we are still close."

　　长垣蒋占区地主不堪压榨
    扶老携幼逃来解放区
  　我游击队深入敌后不法地主不敢倒算
    【本报冀鲁豫二十七日电】我军在蒋占区发动广泛游击战争，保卫各阶层人民利益；蒋军则奸淫抢掠，大肆虐杀，蒋占区人民从切身体验中辨清了敌我，许多地主扶老携幼，大车小辆，逃向我区。长垣八区大舍庄地主××，因其亲戚在“还乡团”，最初觉得没有问题，不料他的三闺女（十七岁）却遭到何冠三部轮奸，全家慌惧异常，逃到濮阳。地主宗秉芝也因不堪蒋军压榨，弃家逃走，他说：“我的人全搬出来了，东西房子任他吧”。有名的“大舍家”舍蓝亭也弃家逃往清丰，有人问他为什么往解放区跑，他说：“不往咱这里跑，往那里跑呢？”鄄城西李楼有名的大地主李西奎，被蒋军抢劫一空，他的儿子也被抓去当兵，他即连夜逃到辽桥。地主们在八年抗战中对八路军共产党有了深刻的认识，他们知道蒋军虽暂时侵占几座空城，但已损失了七八万人。八路军越打越强，终将胜利。因此“还乡团”虽然一再鼓动向群众夺回土地，但大部地主不愿轻易上当。郓城六区五界地主们互相警惕说：“咱可别胡乱闹啊！”二区居庄××地主的儿子不识大体，见我暂时退出，又经坏蛋鼓动，以为可以向人民倒东西了，于是便把农会员××推到场里的豆子摊开就要打，被他老年的父亲知道了，战战兢兢的跑到场里，狠狠的打了他两个耳光，训斥他说：“你疯了？目光如豆，找死！”并向该会员家属致歉说：“孩子家不懂什么，不要给他一般见识”。也有少数不明大义者向农会要土地、要粮食，但在我游击队到达后，他们便感到恐慌不安。郓城××两区，最初部分地主向农会倒地，不久看见我游击队的活动，立即偷偷将文约退还，并承认错误。齐滨、荷泽等县我游击战开展比较普遍，民兵坚强，当过蒋伪保甲长的地主纷纷向我自首。东明地主仍然执行政府法令，帮助军属秋收，给出外民兵代耕。清丰有不少地主向积极分子表示：“中央军来了，俺要跑在你们前边”。寿张许多地主和农会开团结会，公开向农会表示不给蒋军做事，不破坏农会。他们说：“冤仇可解不可结，老辈子就住在一块，还是咱们近”。
