The Mass Movement in Southern Hebei in November

Southern Hebei Branch

The old liberated areas of Southern Hebei—Yuan Dynasty, Jize, Daming, Guangping, Qizhi, Guantao, Qiu County, Guan County, Qinghe, Longping, and Ren County—have successively launched rent reduction movements to realize "land to the tiller." Yuan, Ji, Da, Guang, Qing, Long, and Ren counties have all achieved complete victory, thoroughly overthrowing feudal rule and feudal exploitation, and realizing "land to the tiller." This movement has further enabled cadres and peasants to recognize the insidious plots of the feudal landlords in concealing land, sowing discord among the masses, exploiting loopholes, and launching counterattacks, realizing that peasants cannot truly liberate themselves without completely smashing the feudal system. This movement has also resolved the remaining contradictions and unresolved cases between village cadres, between village cadres and the masses, reformed unqualified old village cadres, absorbed new activists to participate in village-level leadership, united more than 90% of the peasants, and consolidated the peasants' advantage.

The Guan County Party Committee emphasized in this movement the clear division of class status, enabling the masses to recognize class status and grasp policies. After the peasant groups determined the targets for rent reduction, the village cadres had to carefully study them. To prevent a few village cadres and activists from substituting their opinions for those of the masses, the masses were encouraged to thoroughly deliberate and discuss in depth. Qiu County adopted different methods based on different villages when arranging inspections. In villages where feudal forces still held a dominant position, a thorough struggle was to be waged; in villages where landlords had been crushed but the peasants' land problems had not been completely resolved, arbitration was to be used.

This inspection thoroughly implemented the Central Bureau's instruction to "pay special attention to the interests of the middle peasants in this movement." Some counties (such as Guan County) conducted sufficient deliberations among the masses, enabling them to thoroughly understand that "middle and poor peasants are one family" and that class status must be divided by production relations. It was particularly important to distinguish between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, clarifying that not only should middle peasants not be struggled against, but they should be actively united and attracted to participate in the struggle, so that middle peasants could obtain actual benefits. In Qizhi, when Liu Manzhai struggled against illegal landlords, the middle peasants were not very enthusiastic. The village cadres educated the middle peasants based on the specific facts of how the despotic landlords had embezzled, evaded corvée labor, and concealed land to shift burdens onto the middle peasants when they controlled village affairs, and how the middle peasants had no status and were oppressed in the village. The middle peasants' fighting spirit immediately surged. However, there were also a few counties that were eager for quick success and did not conduct good discussions and deliberations on policies. In addition, some leading cadres had a vague understanding of the middle peasant policy, which led to damage to the middle peasants in the movement, causing many middle peasants to "offer up land," such as in Qinghe's Second District, where more than 100 middle peasants offered up land. However, after the leading organs discovered this, they immediately studied it, repeatedly issued instructions, mobilized the poor peasants to return the land and property of the middle peasants, and publicly admitted their mistakes to the masses. The deviation was quickly corrected.

Secondly, in this movement, the Central Bureau's instructions were carried out, patiently and kindly persuading cadres, militiamen, and activists to consciously and voluntarily return the excess land they had acquired to the masses. Qinghe's Wang Guanzhuang promoted democracy to "untie knots" and resolved the peasants' unresolved cases. Experience has proven that county and district cadres must admit their past practice of taking over and substituting for others and the lack of education for village cadres, and affirm their past contributions and achievements, in order to make the village cadres sincerely convinced and correct their mistakes. It is necessary to persuade village cadres to honestly confess their mistakes to the masses and appropriately return the embezzled funds and the excessively distributed fruits in order to obtain the masses' forgiveness. It is also necessary to persuade the masses to recognize the past contributions of the village cadres and to forgive them as long as they correct their mistakes.

The stage of mass mobilization in the new areas has come to an end, and many areas have entered the stage of consolidation. After the thorough examination of emancipation, it has been proven that even in areas with relatively good mass movements, there are still many problems, such as the existence of conspiracies by landlords and special agents to counterattack, and the waste of struggle fruits by village cadres and militiamen. If these problems are not resolved, the masses will not be thoroughly mobilized. After the thorough examination, "thinking meetings" and reflection meetings were generally held in various places to reflect on the past, compare it with the present, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and improve the masses' awareness. Following the Communist Party and following Chairman Mao has become the heartfelt aspiration of the broad masses. In the Dongwangdong Township of Ningnan, 560 out of 800 male and female members conducted deep self-reflection. In the process of reorganizing the Yongzhi Tianzhuang, each person reviewed their attitude toward the landlords during the review and reflection of their suffering, thereby drawing a clear class boundary and consolidating unity.

The Xia Ensha District specifically carried out the reorganization of the armed forces, "washed the faces" of the bad elements, strengthened the peasants' advantage, and universally launched a campaign to have the landlords who had been struggled against sign guarantees and find guarantors, further reducing the conspiracies of illegal landlords to counterattack and carry out sabotage activities, and facilitating the peasants' control over the landlords. At the same time, it proved that once the peasants gained emancipation, their demand for arms was very urgent. Mass leader Gao Fengkui said, "Guns are life, without guns, there is no life." Some militiamen in En County happily wiped their guns every day after buying them. After the struggle for emancipation in Xiajin's Ni Village, in order to suppress armed special agents, 40 out of 242 peasant members joined the militia, strengthening patrols and guarding posts day and night, protecting the village like an iron barrel.

The mass movement in the border areas is combined with armed struggle and has been widely carried out. Experience has proven that if cadres organize armed work teams in the plains to go deep into areas where pseudo-bandits are active, fighting the enemy on the one hand and leading the masses in the struggle for emancipation on the other hand, it is a good way to carry out the struggle in the border areas. Currently, the anti-traitor and grievance-telling movement in the fourth and fifth districts of the county is being widely carried out. The Linzhang Liberation Team concentrated its efforts and entered 53 villages in the pseudo-bandit Guo Qing's ruling area, igniting the flames of grievance-telling, laying the foundation for carrying out guerrilla warfare in the border areas.

However, according to recent reports, the areas carrying out thorough examinations of emancipation and consolidation work are not yet widespread, and some areas have not yet carried it out seriously. This is because some areas' leaders are ideologically satisfied with the mass mobilization. We must clearly recognize that after the mass mobilization, thoroughly defeating the landlord class's rule politically, establishing the peasants' consolidated advantage, eliminating the landlords' conspiracies to counterattack, consolidating the masses ideologically, and resolutely carrying out armed struggle against the enemy are arduous, complex, and more detailed tasks. If the idea of merely being satisfied with mass mobilization continues to exist, the masses' achieved victory will not be consolidated. We must raise our vigilance and earnestly overcome it.

　　冀南十一月群运
    冀南分社
    冀南老区元朝、鸡泽、大名、广平、企之、馆陶、邱县、冠县、清河、隆平、任县相继开展了查减运动，以实现耕者有其田。元、鸡、大、广、清、隆、任七县已全部胜利，彻底打垮了封建统治，与封建剥削，实现了耕者有其田。经过这次运动，使干部与农民进一步认识了封建地主隐蔽土地，挑拨群众关系、钻空子、打反攻的恶毒阴谋，不彻底打碎封建制度，农民是翻不了身的。经过这次运动后也解决了过去残存的村干与村干、村干与群众之间的矛盾与悬案，改造了不称职的旧村干，吸收了新的积极分子参加村级领导，团结了百分之九十以上的农民，巩固了农民的优势。
    冠县县委在这次运动中强调明确划分阶层，使群众认清阶层，掌握政策，由农民小组决定查减对象后，村干还要仔细研究。为防止少数村干、积极分子代替群众意见，并启发群众作彻底酝酿，深入讨论。邱县在布置检查时，根据不同村庄，采取不同方式。在封建势力仍占统治地位的村庄，要彻底斗争；在地主已经被摧垮，农民土地问题解决不够彻底的村子，采取仲裁方式解决。
    这次检查彻底实现了中央局“在这一运动中应特别注意照顾中农群众”的指示。有些县（如冠县）在群众中进行充分的酝酿，使群众彻底认识“中贫农是一家”，必须以生产关系来划分阶层，特别要分清富农与富裕中农的界限，明确了不但不应斗中农而应积极的团结中农，并吸引中农参加斗争，使中农得到实际利益。企之刘满寨斗争不法地主时，中农劲头不大。村干根据恶霸地主掌握村政时，贪污、不出夫、黑瞒地以转嫁负担于中农，及中农在村中没地位受压迫的具体事实，对中农作了教育，中农斗争情绪顿形高涨。但也有少数县份因为急于求功，对政策未做很好的讨论与酝酿，加以有的领导干部对中农政策认识模糊，以致在运动中损伤了中农，使许多中农“献田”，如清河二区有一百多中农献田；但领导机关发现后，马上加以研究，再三发出指示，动员贫苦群众退回中农土地和财物，并公开向群众承认了错误，偏向很快得到纠正。
    其次，在此次运动中，执行了中央局的指示，耐心的善意的说服干部民兵和积极分子，自觉自愿的拿出多要的土地交还群众。清河王官庄发扬民主“解圪瘩”，解决了农民悬案。经验证明：县区干部必须承认过去自己包办代替的作风与对村干教育的不够，肯定他们过去的功劳和成绩，才能使村干心悦诚服，改正错误。必须说服村干部要很好的向群众坦白错误，适当的退出贪污的款子和多分的果实，才能得到群众的原谅。还必须说服群众，认识村干过去是有功劳的，只要他们改正错误，就可原谅。
    新区群众大动阶段已告结束，不少地区已进入巩固阶段。经过翻身大检查，证明即便群众运动比较好的地区，也还存在着许多问题，如地主特务的阴谋反攻，村干民兵的浪费斗争果实等现象的存在，如得不到解决，群众不会彻底发动起来。大检查之后各地普遍的召开了“想想会”，反省会，回忆过去，比比现在，划清敌我界限，提高了群众觉悟，跟共产党走，跟毛主席走，已成为广大群众的心声。宁南东汪东镇男女会员八百人中就有五百六十人进行了深刻反省。永智田庄在整理组织过程中，检讨与反省诉苦中每人对地主的态度，从而划清阶级界限，巩固了团结。
    夏恩沙区特别进行了整理武装，给坏人洗脸，加强了农民的优势，普遍的发动被斗地主具结找保，进一步减少了不法地主阴谋反攻与破坏活动，便利了农民对地主的控制。同时证明了农民一日获得翻身，对武装的要求非常迫切，群众领袖高风魁说：“枪就是命，没有枪就没有命”。恩县有些村民兵买到枪后，欢喜的每天擦一遍。夏津倪庄经过翻身斗争后，为镇压武装特务活动，二四二名农会员就有四十名参加民兵，白天夜里加强岗哨巡逻，把村庄保卫的铁桶一般。
    边沿区群众运动结合武装斗争，已普遍的开展。经验证明：如平原以干部组织武装工作队，深入伪匪活动地区，一面打击敌人，一面领导群众翻身斗争，是开展边地斗争很好的办法。现该县四、五区反奸诉苦运动，正普遍开展。临漳翻身队集中全力，进入伪匪郭清统治区五十三村，燃起诉苦烈火，为开展边沿地区游击战争打下了基础。
    但据最近报导，进行翻身大检查和巩固工作的地区还不普遍，有的地区还没有认真的进行，这是由于某些地区领导思想上满足于群众大动。我们必须清楚的认识，群众大动后，彻底在政治上打垮地主阶级的统治，树立农民巩固的优势，根绝地主阴谋反攻，在思想上巩固群众，坚决和敌人作武装斗争，则是艰苦复杂与更细致的工作。如仅满足于群众大动的思想继续存在，群众已得的胜利是不巩固的，我们必须提高警惕，认真的克服。
