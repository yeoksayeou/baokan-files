　　Militia Martyr Liu Lasuo
    One Life for Six Enemies
    [This dispatch from Changzhi] Liu Lasuo, a militia member from Duiyu Village, Seventh District of Pingding, led seven militiamen to operate deep behind enemy lines on October 3rd. They were surrounded by a regiment of the Yan-puppet army in Yangquan. Lasuo and others resisted bravely, but were eventually captured by the enemy due to being outnumbered. Under severe torture, they were forced to reveal who was in charge. Lasuo readily admitted, "It was me!" The enemy then forced him to remove landmines. Lasuo thought quickly, "Even if I die, I will take a few with me!" He immediately led a group of enemies to the landmines, rushed forward and stepped on the landmine, killing three and wounding three Yan-puppet soldiers. Comrade Lasuo also gloriously sacrificed his life. Comrade Lasuo was a poor peasant and joined the militia in 1943. He has consistently been enthusiastic and dedicated to his work. The militia in the district have unanimously shouted: Learn from Comrade Lasuo's spirit of heroic sacrifice and avenge him!

　　民兵英烈刘拉锁
    一命换六敌
    【本报长治讯】平定七区对峪村民兵刘拉锁，于十月三日带领七个民兵深入敌后活动，被阳泉阎伪一个团包围，拉锁等奋勇抵抗，卒因我寡敌众，被敌所俘。严刑拷打，逼问是谁负责，拉锁即慨然承认：“是我！”敌人即逼其起卸地雷，拉锁心头一旋，“死也要拚几个！”当即带领一群敌人，走到地雷跟前，猛地上前将地雷踏响，六个阎伪军三死三伤，拉锁同志亦光荣牺牲。拉锁同志是贫农，一九四三年即参加民兵，一贯工作积极热心。该区民兵已一致喊出：学习拉锁同志的英勇牺牲精神，为他报仇。
