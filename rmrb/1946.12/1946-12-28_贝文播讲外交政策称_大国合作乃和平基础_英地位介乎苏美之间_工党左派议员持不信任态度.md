Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 25th: According to a United Press report: British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a fifteen-minute radio address on the 22nd, outlining the British government's relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union and its policies. Prior to this, more than a hundred Labour MPs had criticized Bevin's policies on this extremely important issue. Bevin stated: Gentlemen, you have been discussing that our policies are too close to the United States and not close enough to the Soviet Union, and that this situation is detrimental to world peace and will lead to another war. My first response to this kind of argument is that Britain believes that any noble ideal must be based on its own value. Unless it involves the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter, Britain does not want to have a binding relationship with any country. My second answer is that we extend the hand of friendship and cooperation to all countries. We always believe that friendship and cooperation between the major powers is the sure foundation for building lasting peace. When discussing Britain's position between the United States and the Soviet Union, Bevin pointed out that "the war created two major powers—the United States and the Soviet Union, and Britain is geographically and in its way of life between the two." Bevin continued: "If the five powers live together in coordination and harmony, and with the contribution of the capabilities of the smaller countries to assist them, who would dare believe that the hope of a Third World War would become possible?" Regarding the Soviet Union, Bevin stated: "Countries around the world are preparing to cooperate with the Soviet Union and recognize that other countries have the equal right to develop their own way of life, and therefore are willing to see the development of the Soviet Union's own system." Regarding the two major conferences in New York, Bevin believed that "universal disarmament throughout the world in the future will increase the efficiency of the United Nations organization." "The lengthy meeting in New York was an extremely dangerous period, but patience finally prevailed, and I am fully convinced that understanding will be created." Regarding the German issue, Bevin believed that "economic cooperation in the British and American occupation zones has made a practical start to the solution of this problem." He also believed that "it will take at least thirty years to completely resolve the German issue."
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 25th: United Press, London: Labour opposition party members generally welcome Bevin's foreign policy speech, but will not give full support until further evidence confirms that the British government is indeed taking a compromise attitude between the United States and the Soviet Union. They believe that Bevin's speech is an attempt to seek a compromise with those Labour Party members who previously criticized Bevin's policies for being too close to the United States. Critics say that Bevin's definition of foreign policy is to seek "the convergence of ideas between great powers and to establish harmony between these countries," which is precisely what they have always advocated. Zilliacus, one of the most left-wing Labour MPs in the House of Commons, said: "As long as these guidelines are followed, we will of course support the government, but we will not take words as actions."

　　贝文播讲外交政策称
    大国合作乃和平基础
    英地位介乎苏美之间
    工党左派议员持不信任态度
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据合众社报导：英外相贝文于二十二日发表十五分钟的广播演说，概述英政府与美苏之关系及其政策。前此，百余名工党议员曾在这一极其重要的问题上批评了贝文的政策。贝文称：诸君曾经纷纷议论，说我们的政策与美国过分密切，与苏联的关系未能达到应有的密切，且谓此种情形有碍世界和平，并将引向另一战争。我对此种议论的首一答复：是英国认为任何高尚之理想，必须根据其本身之价值而来，除非涉及联合国宪章所规定之义务，英国不欲与任何国家发生约束关系。我的第二个答复：是我们向所有国家伸出友谊与合作之手，我们永远相信各大国之间的友谊与合作是建筑永久和平的确实基础。贝文谈及英国在美苏之间的地位时，指出“战争造成了两大强国——美国与苏联，而英国在地理上及生活方式上均介乎两者之间”。贝文继称：“如五强共处于协调与和谐之中，且得各小国贡献能力为其协助，则谁人敢信第三次大战的希望成为可能？”关于苏联，贝文称：“世界各国在准备与苏联合作，并承认其他国家有发展其本身生活方式之同等权利，因而愿见苏联本国制度之发展。”谈及纽约的两大会议时，贝文认为“来日全世界之普遍裁军，将增加联合国组织之效率”。“纽约冗长之会议，乃极为危险之时期，然忍耐终告胜利，余日全心深信谅解将可造成”。关于德国问题，贝文认为“英美占领区经济上的合作，已使此一问题之解决，获得实际上的开始”。彼又认为“欲使德国问题完全解决，至少须时三十年”。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】合众社伦敦讯：工党反对派党员，一般欢迎贝文的外交政策演说，但在未有进一步的证明证实英政府确实是在美国与苏联之间采取折衷态度之前，暂不予以全面的支持。他们认为贝文的演说，是企图与以前批评贝文的政策太过于亲近美国的那些工党党员谋取妥协。批评者称：贝文对外交政策之定义，为寻求“大国之间观念的接近，并建立这些国家之间的和谐”，这正是他们的一贯主张。下院中最左工党议员之一的齐里亚库兰称：“只要遵行这些方针当然支持政府，但我们不会把言词看作行动”。
