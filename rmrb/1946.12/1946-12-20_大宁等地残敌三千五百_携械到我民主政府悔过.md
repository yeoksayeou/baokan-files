Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 16th: The remnants of the Yan Xishan troops who roamed the mountains and fields of Daning, Shilou, and Xi counties have been suppressed by the local troops and militia of the Eighth Route Army and persuaded by the local people. Already 3,500 people have brought their weapons to the democratic government to confess their crimes. The Yan Xishan county magistrate of Daning led more than 500 remnants from Daning to Linfen. A large number of soldiers deserted on the way, and only more than 40 people remained when they arrived in Linfen. When He Zhengze, the Yan Xishan county magistrate of Shilou, led his remnants to the border between Lingshi and Xiaoyi, they were intercepted by guerrillas, who seized 16 rifles, 1 machine gun, 2 grenade launchers, and 2 submachine guns. More than 1,000 "National Soldiers" of Shilou who had been forcibly conscripted by the Yan Xishan army, under the influence of fathers teaching sons and wives persuading husbands, have successively surrendered to the Eighth Route Army. In the first ten days of this month alone, there were 12 people, including Ren Decai of the Yan Xishan "Public Security Bureau" of Shilou. A platoon leader of the machine gun company of the 26th Regiment of the Yan Xishan "Security Brigade" of Daning led a unit of soldiers with three machine guns, 31 rifles, and 2 submachine guns to surrender to the Eighth Route Army.
Taiyue, 17th: Yan Xishan's 49th Division deserter Pang Yueyou said, "Fighting the Eighth Route Army will not win." This is a truth deeply experienced by many lower-level officers and soldiers of the Chiang-Yan army in the months of civil war. Pang Yueyou said that last month, the 49th Division was transferred north from Taiyuan, and in their company alone, more than 20 platoon leaders and soldiers deserted together. Last month, a company instructor of Yan's puppet Li Yangtang's unit stationed in Chengjing Village, Jiang County, took three brothers and planned to escape. The plainclothes captain ordered them to rob things in the village together. They immediately beat the plainclothes captain and his guards to death and fled with their weapons. On the 10th, the same thing happened in Jiang County. A team member killed a squad leader and ran out with three rifles. Pang Yueyou said, "Even the Japanese were afraid to fight the Eighth Route Army." He was a poor peasant from Fenxi County. In 1943, he was "organized" by Yan Xishan and drafted into the army. This time, he took advantage of the 49th Division's northward transfer to escape and was stopped by the militia of the Fourth District of Huo County. The militiamen asked him what he wanted to do. He said he wanted to go home to farm, so they sent him home.

　　大宁等地残敌三千五百  携械到我民主政府悔过
    【新华社晋绥十六日电】窜扰于大宁、石楼、隰县等县山野间之阎军残部，遭八路军地方兵团民兵剿除与当地人民之劝导，已有三千五百人携械到民主政府悔了过。大宁阎军县长率残部五百余由大宁赴临汾，中途士兵大批逃亡，至临汾时仅余四十余人。石楼阎县长贺正泽率残部窜抵灵石孝义边境时，即遭到游击队截击，计缴获步枪十六支，机枪一挺、掷弹筒两个、冲锋枪二挺。被阎军强抓之石楼千余“国民兵”，在父教子、妇劝夫的影响下，均已陆续向八路军投诚。仅本月上旬，即有石楼阎“公安局”任德才等十二人。大宁阎军“保安队二十六团机枪连排长，率士兵一部携机枪三挺、步枪三十一支，冲锋枪二挺，向八路军投诚”。
    【本报太岳十七日电】阎军四十九师逃兵庞月有说：“打八路军是胜不了的”，这是蒋阎军许多下级官兵在几个月的内战中，深切体验到的一个真理。庞月说，上月四十九师自太原北调，光他们一个连，就有排长士兵二十多个人结伙逃跑。上月驻绛县程景村的阎伪李仰唐部一个连指导员，带了三个弟兄计划逃跑，便衣队长却让他们一起到村里抢东西，他们即将该便衣队长及他的护兵打死，携械潜逃。十日，绛县城内也发生同样的事情，一个队员打死了一个班长，带了三条步枪跑出来。庞月有说：“连日本人也怕和八路军打仗哩”。他是汾西县的贫农，三十二年被阎锡山“编组”编出来当兵的，这次趁四十九师北调逃出来，被我霍县四区民兵盘查住，民兵们问他愿意干啥，他说愿意回家种地，便送他回家去了。
