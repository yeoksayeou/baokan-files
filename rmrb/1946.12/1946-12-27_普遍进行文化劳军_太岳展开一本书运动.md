　　[This newspaper Taiyue 25th dispatch] The "One Book" campaign of cultural support for the troops is now being enthusiastically launched in our district. Since the Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore began its cultural support for the troops, it has been overcrowded every day. Most of the books sold are "Soldiers," "Party Membership Certificates," "Documents," "People's Poems," etc. Comrade Guards from the District Party Committee organs, after donating seven or eight books themselves, some transportation comrades and guard comrades, who are familiar with what kind of books the soldiers like, such as "The Story of Zhu De," etc., but because the bookstore did not sell them, they donated their beloved books to the front. Kong Lufu, the postman leader of the Yangcheng Post Office, repaired his own worn-out shoes and saved enough money for a pair of shoes to buy books for the front. Cook Xing Weihe saved money on cigarettes to buy books, saying, "People are shedding blood at the front, I can't smoke less." The reception room of the Administrative Office is full of guests coming and going, but after receiving the news of cultural support for the troops, they have donated their favorite books. A comrade who had no books and no money wrote a letter of condolence to express his thoughts. Many people at the Xinhua Daily and the Xinhua Branch inscribed their donated books with "Dedicated to my most beloved combatant comrades," etc. The teachers and students of Yangcheng No. 3 High School, who had just returned from serving in the front-line hospital, donated all 1,370 yuan of their labor income to buy books, and also donated 102 books and wrote 30 letters of condolence after learning about the cultural support campaign. According to the Political Department of the Military Region, the first batch of 2,332 books has been received and will be shipped to the front. Various agencies are still sending books one after another.

　　普遍进行文化劳军  太岳展开一本书运动
    【本报太岳二十五日电】文化劳军的“一本书运动”现已在本区热烈展开，太岳新华书店从文化劳军开始以来，日日拥挤不堪，售出的书大部分是“兵”、“党费证”、“文件”、“人民诗歌”等，区党委机关的卫士同志等，首先自己捐出七八本书以后，有些交通员同志，警卫员同志，他们熟悉战士欢喜什么样的书，象朱德二三事等，但因为书店没卖的，就将自己心爱的书捐给前方。阳城邮局邮工班长孔禄福，把自己的烂鞋修理一下，节省出一双鞋钱，买书送给前方。炊事员邢未和，节省烟钱买书，他说：“人家在前方流血，我不能少吸点烟。”行署招待室里都是些来来往往的客人，但得到文化劳军的消息后，纷纷捐出自己心爱的书来，有个同志没有书也没钱，他写封信慰问，表示自己的心思。新华日报与新华分社，不少人在自己赠送的书本上题上“赠送给我所最敬爱的战斗员同志”等。阳城三高师生刚从前方医院服务回来，得到文化劳军消息，除将自己劳动所得的一千三百七十元全部购书外，又捐出书一百零二本，写慰问信三十封。据军区政治部谈，现已收到第一批书二千三百三十二本，将运往前方，现各机关仍在纷纷送书。
