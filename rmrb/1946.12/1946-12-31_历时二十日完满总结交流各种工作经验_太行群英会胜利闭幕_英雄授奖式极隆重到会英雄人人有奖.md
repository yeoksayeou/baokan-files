After Director Li Yiqing of the Administrative Office announced to the heroes the plan to improve technology, combine sideline occupations, and universally achieve "cultivating three days, saving one" for next year's great production, the Taihang Second Heroes' Congress, lasting twenty days, victoriously closed on the 21st. The closing ceremony was still held at the Lotus Pond Grand Parade Ground in Changzhi City, and awards were presented simultaneously. In addition to all the heroes, the mayor and more than 7,000 people from the nearby suburbs also came to celebrate. Before the meeting, the venue was filled with flags and the sound of drums and gongs filled the air. The prizes were lined up in front of the rostrum: colorful banners were dazzling, including oxen and fine donkeys awarded to agricultural labor heroes, brand-new rifles, small cannons, and hand grenades awarded to militiamen, cotton gins awarded to cooperation heroes, hand-pulled shuttle looms and copper-lead awarded to textile heroes, as well as plows, seed drills, hoes, shovels, silver shields, silver medals, and certificates from the Administrative Office. The crowd crowded around, watching and praising.

At 2:00 PM, the ceremony began with music and cannons. Director Li Yiqing delivered the closing speech, followed by the award presentation. Awards were divided into individual and collective awards. Whether elected as heroes of the entire region or not, every hero, model worker, and representative who attended received an award. The order of awards was agricultural mutual aid heroes, cooperation heroes, textile heroes, emancipated heroes, enemy-killing heroes, model workers, skilled workers, and finally various non-elected heroes and representatives. During the award ceremony, Secretary-General of the Congress Wu Guangtang called out the names, and the heroes stepped forward to the rostrum, where Director Li shook hands with them one by one as a salute, announced the prizes, and then music was played, awards were presented, and photos were taken. The ceremony was extremely solemn.

When Shi Cunjin, Li Shunda, Zhang Laotai, and other eight newly and formerly liberated area first-class agricultural mutual aid heroes appeared on the rostrum, the audience burst into thunderous applause. The seated masses stood up to get a better look at the heroes, and the people in the back shouted, "Those in front, sit down!" Amidst the best efforts of the traditional instrumental ensemble, the award-giving comrades were busy awarding the eight heroes medals, flags, and certificates, distributing a bolt of cloth, two books, leather gloves, and a bonus of 2,000 yuan to each. The eight banners fluttered on their bodies, shining even more brilliantly in the setting sun. The crowd whispered to each other. Zhao Tinggui, a merchant from South Street, said: "This is even more impressive than winning the imperial examination in the past. It is truly a world for the working people!" Shen Xi from Jingjia Village said: "With increased production and government rewards like this, I can finally have a solid foundation." A sixty-year-old labor hero from Wuma Village in Changzhi, who did not attend, said confidently in a letter: "I missed it this year, but I'll try again next year." When the cooperation heroes were awarded, Ma Dachou, a Hui from Changzhi City and a leader of a fur cooperative, said: "Our cooperative has just been organized. If we work hard, we will be heroes next year too!" In particular, the seventeen-year-old militia hero Zhang Fubao aroused the admiration of the entire audience. He was small and thin, still just a child. Who would have thought that he could create earth-shattering heroic deeds in killing the enemy and be elected as a hero of the entire region? There were too many prizes and the award flag was too long, and he could not hold the flag well with both hands. The comrade giving the award helped him hold it properly, and the photographer took a separate photo of him. The award ceremony ended at 4:30 PM, and a celebration parade was held immediately. All the gongs, drums, and traditional instrumental ensembles started playing. The heroes' procession, surrounded by the crowd, walked out of the square. Sixteen brightly decorated and red-draped cars were lined up to wait for them. The parade passed through Weiqian Street, Shizi Street... The crowd escorted the heroes all the way to the Heroes' Congress venue (the Normal School site) before dispersing. (Jia Jun)

　　历时二十日完满总结交流各种工作经验
    太行群英会胜利闭幕
    英雄授奖式极隆重到会英雄人人有奖
    【本报太行二十九日电】在行署李主任一清同志向众英雄宣布提高技术，结合副业，普遍做到耕三余一的明年大生产计划后，历时二十天的太行二届群英大会已于二十一日胜利闭幕。闭幕典礼仍在长治市莲花池大操场举行，同时并进行发奖。参加者除全体英雄外，市长及近郊群众七千余人亦赶来庆祝。开会前会场旗帜如林，锣鼓喧天。主席台前奖品罗列：各色锦旗花艳夺目，有奖给农业劳动英雄的黄牛和骏驴，奖给民兵的崭新的步枪、小炮和手榴弹，奖合作英雄的轧花机，奖纺织英雄的手拉梭织布机和铜铅，及犁、耧、锄、锹、银盾、银质奖章、行署奖状等。群众拥挤围观，啧啧称赞。
    下午二时，奏乐鸣炮，典礼开始，由李主任一清致闭幕词后，开始授奖。分个人奖与集体奖。无论当选为全区的英雄或未当选的英雄、模范、代表，凡到会的，人人有奖，授奖次序为农业互助英雄、合作英雄、纺织英雄、翻身英雄、杀敌英雄、模范、能手、最后为未当选的各种英雄、代表。授奖时，首由大会秘书长武光汤唱名，英雄即出列至主席台前，由李主任与之一一握手为礼，宣布奖品后，即奏乐、授奖、摄影，仪式极为庄重。
    当选太行新老区一等农业互助英雄的石寸金、李顺达、张老太等八位出现在主席台前时，全场掌声雷动，坐着的群众为了瞻仰英雄，都站了起来，后面的群众瞧不见就一片呼喝“前面的坐下”。在八音会尽力吹打中，发奖同志忙着为八位英雄佩带奖章、授旗、授奖状，每人散发布一匹、书两册、皮手套及奖金二千元。八面锦旗飘在他们的身上，在西斜的阳光辉照下，更觉辉煌。群众相互低语着，南街商人赵廷桂说：这比从前中状元还排场，真正是劳苦人的世道！景家庄申喜的说：生产发了家，政府这样奖励，这我可算有个底了。长治五马村一位没有出席的六十岁的老劳动英雄有信心的说：今年误了，明年再说。合作英雄授奖时，长市回民马大丑、一位皮毛合作社的领导者，他说：咱的合作社刚组织起来，好好干，下年也要当个英雄呢！特别是十七岁的民兵小英雄张福保，更引起全场敬佩，他身体瘦小，还完全是一个小孩，谁想得到他就能创造了惊天动地的英勇杀敌事迹，当选为全区的英雄呢？奖品太多，奖旗太长，他两手张罗都把奖旗拿不好。发奖的同志帮助拿好了，摄影记者特为他单独拍了一张。授奖完毕已至下午四时半，即举行庆祝游行，所有的锣鼓、八音会都吹打起来。英雄的行列在群众簇拥下走出广场，十六辆结彩披红的大汽车，一字儿排开等待着他们。游行经卫前街，十字大街………。群众直把英雄送到群英会场（师范校址）始散。（家军）
