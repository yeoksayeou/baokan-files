　　Another Traitorous Treaty!
  　Chiang and the U.S. Establish Aviation Agreement
  　U.S. Obtains Important Tool for Aggression Against Asia and the World

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: The Chiang government has concluded yet another sell-out contract with the United States – the "Sino-American Aviation Agreement Draft." Since August, Chiang Kai-shek's representatives have been conducting secret negotiations with U.S. government representative Powell. On the afternoon of the 30th, the draft agreement was officially "agreed upon," after which the Central News Agency began to publicize it. The draft stipulates "the establishment and development of regular air transport flights between the territories of China and the United States," and that "airlines of China and the United States shall have the right to load and unload international passengers, cargo, and mail at designated locations within the territories of both countries. The designated locations in China are Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and the designated locations in the United States are San Francisco, Honolulu, and New York. This draft agreement stipulates three routes: the first is the North Pacific route, passing through Canada, Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, the Kuril Islands, Japan, and Korea; the second is the Central Pacific route, passing through Hawaii, Wake Island, Guam, and the Philippines; and the third is the Atlantic route, passing through Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, India, Burma, and Vietnam. The U.S. designates Northwest Airlines, Pan American Airlines, and Trans World Airlines, and China designates China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, to fly the above routes."
    
Xinhua News Agency Note: This is a complete sell-out of China's sovereign rights over its airspace by Chiang Kai-shek. Prior to this, on August 30th, Chiang Kai-shek signed a contract with American Chennault, allowing Chennault to organize an air transport brigade to fly throughout China. On September 2nd, he signed an agreement with the U.S.-controlled Philippine government regarding aircraft landings between Shanghai and Manila. Our country's public opinion has long exposed that Chiang Kai-shek has allowed the sale of all airspace rights as one of the exchange conditions for the U.S. to provide 800 million yuan in surplus materials to assist Chiang in the civil war. Chiang Kai-shek loudly proclaims: "Rather give to foreign friends than to family slaves," and this is further proof. The "mutual equality" facade of the draft agreement is utterly false. The "China" and "Central" companies, run by the Chiang family, only have a few broken airplanes, while the three U.S. aviation trusts, Northwest, Pan American, and Trans World, are incredibly large in scale. Therefore, in addition to China losing its air sovereignty, American goods will further flood the Chinese market, destroying China's national economy. On the American side, the Chiang-U.S. aviation agreement is not only a tool for colonizing China but also an important tool for American aggression against the entire Asian and the world's countries. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 21st: "The United States is now rapidly promoting its 'reciprocal aviation agreement program' in an attempt to open up avenues for expanding international transportation. The resumption of Eastern aviation business by the United States, the agreement with China is an important factor, which can extend the U.S. air route to the world. The United States' aviation agreements with India and the Philippines have been completed in the past few days, and the same agreement with Siam can be settled soon."

### 又一卖国契约！　蒋美成立航空协定　美获得侵略亚洲与世界的重要工具

　　又一卖国契约！
  　蒋美成立航空协定
  　美获得侵略亚洲与世界的重要工具
    【新华社延安一日电】蒋政府又与美国成立另一卖身契——“中美航空协定草案”。是项协定自八月起，蒋介石代表即与美政府代表鲍威尔进行秘密谈判，直至卅日午后，该协定草案正式“议妥”后，中央社始予公布。草案规定“设立并发展中美两国领土间定期空运飞航”，“中美两国航空公司，可在两国领土内并指定地点有装卸国际客货邮件之权利，中国指定地点为天津、上海、广州三处，美国指定地点为旧金山、檀香山、纽约三处。此项协定草案规定航线三条，第一条为北太平洋航线，经过加拿大、阿拉斯加、阿留申、千岛、日本、朝鲜诸地；第二条为中太平洋航线，经过夏威夷、威克岛、关岛、菲律滨诸地；第三条为大西洋航线，经过欧洲、北非、中东、印度、缅甸、越南诸地。美方指定西北航空公司、泛美航空公司、环球航空公司，中国指定中国航空公司，中央航空公司，飞行上述诸航线”。
    新华社按：此为蒋介石对中国领空主权的全面出卖，在此前，八月三十日蒋介石即曾与美人陈纳德签订准许陈纳德组织空运大队在中国各地飞行的合同；九月二日，复曾与美国控制的菲律滨政府签订上海马尼剌间的飞机降落协定。我国舆论界早已揭露蒋介石曾允许以出卖全部领空权作为美国以八亿元剩余物资助蒋内战的交换条件之一。蒋介石大唱：“勿予家奴，宁赠友帮”，从此又得一明证。协定草案的“相互平等”的形式，是绝端虚伪的。蒋家官营的“中国”“中央”两公司只有几架破飞机，而美国的西北、泛美、环球三家航空托辣斯，规模雄大无比，故除中国丧失空中主权外，美货将越加淹没中国市场，摧毁中国的民族经济。在美国方面，蒋美航空协定，不仅为其殖民地化中国的工具，而且是美国侵略整个亚洲及全世界各国的重要工具。据美联社廿一日华盛顿电称：“美国现正迅速推行其‘互惠航空协定程序’，企图为扩展国际交通开辟途径。美国恢复东方航空业务，对华协定实为重要的因素，可使美国航空线扩展至全球。美国对印度与菲律滨之航空协定，已于前数日完成，对暹罗之同样协定不久亦可商妥。
