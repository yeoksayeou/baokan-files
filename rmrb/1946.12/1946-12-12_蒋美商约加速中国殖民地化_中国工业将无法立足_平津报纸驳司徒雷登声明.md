    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 9th: Beijing News: On November 25th, the American Ambassador to China, Stuart, issued a statement in Shanghai defending the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, saying, "It is not an unequal treaty." Newspapers in Tianjin and Beijing have published many articles refuting this. The Tianjin Minsheng Guide newspaper stated on the 26th: "Ambassador Stuart's statement is clearly insufficient to dispel our doubts. It is undeniable that the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, in its essence, accelerates China's path towards becoming a colony. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty adds a layer of legal protection to the influx of American goods into China and allows the United States to export large amounts of capital to directly establish factories in China. Our dying national industry will collapse entirely due to its inability to compete. Even if Stuart defends it eloquently, the United States will selfishly gain practical benefits." The Beijing Yi Shi Bao newspaper stated on the 28th: "Ambassador Stuart said that China has not lost its tariff autonomy or the right to control shipping and foreign trade, but because the commercial treaty stipulates that Americans have the freedom to reside in the interior, the protection of tariffs and trade is 'diluted'." The newspaper cited a report from the Associated Press: "Twenty ready-made American factories have already set off to move east and will soon arrive in China. These factories include flour mills, automobile assembly plants, yarn mills, hydroelectric plants, and warehouses." It emphatically stated, "This report proves that Chinese industry will be unable to stand its ground."

    蒋美商约加速中国殖民地化
    中国工业将无法立足
    平津报纸驳司徒雷登声明
    【新华社延安九日电】北平讯：上月二十五日，美驻华大使司徒雷登曾在沪发表声明，辩护中美商约谓：“并非不平等的条约”。平津报纸对此多著论予以驳斥。天津民生导报二十六日称：“司徒大使的声明，显不足以化除我们的疑团，中美商约的骨子里使我国加速度地走向殖民地道路，这是无可否认的。中美商约给美货之源源来华加上一层合法的保障，并使美国输出大量资本，直接在华建立工厂，我们奄奄一息的民族工业将因无法竞争而全部倒闭。司徒纵使振振有辞地作辩护，但美国却从心所欲地得到实惠。”北平益世报二十八日称：“司徒大使说中国并未丧失关税自主或控制航运及国外贸易的权限，但由于商约上规定美人有内地杂居自由，故关税贸易上的保护是被‘冲淡了’。”该报列举合众社的报导，“美国二十家现成工厂已起程东迁，即将到达中国，这些工厂包括面粉厂汽车装配厂纱厂水电厂以及仓库。力称“这一报导证明中国工业将无法立足”。
