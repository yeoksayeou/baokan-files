　　[This report from the Taiyue region on the 5th] The × village in Fushan is located 15 li from the city, on a high ground protruding beside the ×× highway. When Chiang's troops attacked Fushan, the villagers once withdrew into the mountains. Later, because Chiang's troops were engaged in frenzied burning and looting, they could not bear to see their painstakingly built homes destroyed by the enemy and shouted, "We want to fight back home!" So, on the 29th of last month, they organized a Home Guard, led personally by Comrade Qin Tingming, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, and returned to their village. First, they completed the autumn harvest and planting. At this time, the 81st Regiment of Chiang's troops began to attack ×× village. On the 31st, they first sent three plainclothes spies to the village to reconnoiter, but they were captured by our Home Guard, who then turned ×× village into a terrifying minefield. On the 3rd of this month, more than a hundred Chiang's troops from the city advanced on the village. The three plainclothes spies in front entered the minefield and two were killed by the explosion. The main force of Chiang's troops fled in disarray. On the 6th, more than a hundred Chiang's troops, in coordination with the "Love the Homeland Corps" and "Revenge Squad," bypassed the village and went to Xiyang Village to loot grain. The Home Guard ambushed them on the roadside, killing two enemies. The rest retreated in panic. On the 11th, more than fifty Chiang's troops, carrying four heavy machine guns, advanced towards the Lijiashan area four li south of the village. The Home Guard, in conjunction with the rotational warfare team, blocked them midway, killing or wounding three enemies. The Chiang's troops returned in frustration; that night they retaliated with a sneak attack, but when they advanced to the Boshu minefield in the village, they stepped on stone mines, and a series of explosions erupted. The enemy was forced to carry away several corpses and retreat. At present, a paving the ground movement is being carried out inside and outside the village, burying countless stone mines.

　　组织保家队打回家浮山某村四败蒋军
    【本报太岳五日电】浮山×村离城十五里，为一突出于××公路旁之高地。该村群众在蒋军进攻浮山时，曾一度撤入山地，后因蒋军疯狂烧抢，他们不忍自己心血经营的家园被敌摧毁，高喊：“我们要打回家去”。遂于上月二十九日组织保家队，由武委会主任秦挺明同志亲自带领群众，回到本村，首先完成秋收秋种，此时蒋军八一团开始向××村进攻。三十一日先派三个便衣到该村侦察，被我保家队捕获，保家队又把××村造成恐怖的雷区。本月三日城内蒋军百余，向该村进犯，前面三个便衣进至雷区，被炸死两人，大队蒋军狼狈窜去。六日，蒋军百余人配合“爱乡团”“复仇队”绕过该村，到西杨村抢粮，保家队又在路边伏击，毙敌两名，其余仓惶而退。十一日蒋军五十余人携重机枪四挺向该村南四里之李家山一带进犯，保家队又结合轮战队于中途阻击，毙伤敌三人，蒋军沮丧而回；当夜即报复偷袭，但进至该村柏树填雷区，又踏响石雷，一时爆炸声大作，敌被迫抬上死尸数具而回。现该村内外正实行铺地运动，埋藏下无数石雷。
