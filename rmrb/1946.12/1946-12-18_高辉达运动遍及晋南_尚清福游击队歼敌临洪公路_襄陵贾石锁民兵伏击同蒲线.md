[This dispatch from our paper, Taiyue, dated the 16th] Since the famous cold-gun combat hero Gao Huida and explosion hero Shang Qingfu on the Tongpu Railway launched a competition to defend their homes and kill the enemy, Shang Qingfu has been active day and night on both sides of the Lin (Fen) - Hong (Dong) and Hong (Dong) - Tun (Liu) highways. On November 29th, they destroyed a Chiang army vehicle on the Lin-Hong Highway. When Chiang's army from Linfen came to reinforce, Shang Qingfu's guerrilla unit immediately adopted dispersed cold-gun tactics, killing five Chiang soldiers and wounding fifteen on the spot. This movement is now spreading to counties such as Xiangling. Jia Shisuo, the instructor of a certain village, led the village militia to ambush a large truck of the 30th Division of the Chiang army at Jingcunwan on the Tongpu Railway on the 3rd of this month, capturing a lieutenant quartermaster alive, seizing 30 sets of military uniforms, and two mules. The local people celebrated and said, "We also have a Gao Huida." The Quwo militia has now gone down the mountains and is actively operating in the plains. The Fushan militia has adopted night-raid tactics, sneaking into the Zhangdian District Office on the 1st of this month and capturing a Gao. The Linfen militia has also proposed a "competition for meritorious service," their slogan being: "Not only kill, but also capture alive." They have also put forward a specific plan to eliminate 150 enemies within the month of December.
