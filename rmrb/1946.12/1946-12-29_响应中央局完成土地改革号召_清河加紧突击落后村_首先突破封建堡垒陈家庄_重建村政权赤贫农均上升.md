[This dispatch from our newspaper in Weixian on the 27th] Responding to the Central Bureau's call to complete land reform before the spring plowing next year, Qinghe is intensifying its efforts to conquer backward villages. Chen Family Village in the fourth district of the county has always had its village political power controlled by feudal forces, who ruled the masses. The Chen surname was a large household, oppressing the Jiao, Wang, Li, and other mixed surnames. Later, the Chen surname broke down internally due to ancestral property disputes, resulting in the Eastern Chen and Western Chen factions, whose representatives were both feudal forces. During the mass movement last year, Eastern Chen, which controlled the village administration, defeated Western Chen. During this thorough review for turning over a new leaf, both sides felt that they could not escape the masses' reckoning of their crimes, so the two Chens sent representatives to negotiate and agreed that neither would struggle against the other. Village cadres controlled by feudal forces, after returning to the village from a district meeting, said to the masses at a general meeting: "The district says that this struggle is to fight against the local bullies and landlords, and there are no local bullies and landlords in our village, so don't struggle too soon." The Chen surname actively controlled the farmers' association, and they participated in the small group meetings, so the masses in each group were afraid to raise any objections. When district cadres discovered this problem, they went deep into the lower levels, talked to the masses, and asked Chen Yutong, a victim of oppression: "Who in your village is being bullied, and who is the local bully?" His reply was: "What's the point of talking about that? It won't get done, and if people find out, it won't work. Even if I say it, those people (referring to the current village cadres) won't lead us to do it." The district cadres immediately stated their position to them: "The government will definitely help you turn over a new leaf." Their determination to fight was heightened, and they immediately got together to discuss turning over a new leaf, and decided to unite more people. They quickly colluded with more than a dozen people and formed a new farmers' association. After discussion, they collected materials and identified the targets of struggle. When the original village cadres heard about this, they became furious. Chen Zhenfang even proposed in front of the masses: "Oppose arranged marriages, oppose undemocratic practices," and also said: "We are not afraid of the people in the district." When the masses saw this situation, some of them said at the time: "How can we do it? The people in the district are also in trouble." The nascent force was once again suppressed by feudal forces. However, the majority of the masses were not discouraged and were determined to fight. Finally, with the support of the district cadres, they convened a mass meeting, exposed the conspiracy of the feudal landlords, and declared the dissolution of the old farmers' association. They called on the masses to join the new farmers' association, and after three days of work, they united 320 people. The first shot was fired against the local bully Chen Qingnian, and then the backstage landlord of the Eastern Chen faction, Chen Dianling, the pen-pusher Chen Heyu, and his son Chen Zhenfang were also fought. At this time, the masses said: "The more we fight, the more energetic we become. Those who stand up straight are honest people, and those who lack energy are bad guys." The broad masses of working people have since become masters of their own affairs, elected village-level cadres, and distributed land. Nineteen extremely poor households and seventeen poor peasant households have all been promoted to middle-lower and middle peasants, and the feudal rulers of thousands of years have collapsed.

　　响应中央局完成土地改革号召
    清河加紧突击落后村
    首先突破封建堡垒陈家庄
    重建村政权赤贫农均上升
    【本报威县二十七日电】响应中央局争取明年春耕前完成土地改革的号召，清河加紧突击落后村。该县四区陈家庄历来是封建势力掌握村政大权，统治群众。陈姓是大户，压迫着焦、王、李等杂姓。后来陈姓为祖业纠纷，内部破裂，产生了东陈西陈两派，代表人物都是封建势力。去年群运时，东陈掌握着村政，斗败了西陈。这次翻身大检查中，双方都感到自己罪恶脱不了群众清算，两陈互派代表，商定了谁也不斗谁。为封建势力掌握的村干部，从区开会回村后，在大会上向群众说：“区里说啦，这次斗争是斗恶霸地主，咱村里没有恶霸地主，趁早不要斗”。陈姓积极掌握农会，开小组会他们分别参加进去，各组里群众有意见也不敢提。区干部发现这一问题，便深入下层，找群众谈话，向苦主陈玉同问道：“你村谁受气，谁是恶霸？”他的答复是：“说那个干啥，又弄不起来，人家知道了准不行。即使说了，人家（指现有村干部）也不领着干。”区干部即向他们表明态度：“政府一定帮助你们翻身。”他们的斗争决心提高了，随即到一块商量翻身的事，决定团结更多的人。很快就串连了十几个，组成新农会，经过讨论，搜集好材料，找出了斗争对象。原来的村干部听说后起了火，陈振芳在群众面前竟提出：“反对包办，反对不民主，”又说：“区里的人咱也不怕。”群众看到这个情形，当时有的就说：“咱怎么能行，区里的还落了难哩。”新生的力量又被封建势力压了一下。但多数群众毫不灰心，坚决要斗争，终于在区干部撑腰下，召开了群众大会，揭破封建地主的阴谋，并声明解散旧农会。号召群众参加新农会，经过三天的功夫，团结起三百二十个人。第一炮斗了恶霸陈庆年，接着又斗了东陈派后台地主陈奠岭、刀笔陈河雨和他儿子陈振芳。这时群众说：“越斗越有劲，挺起身来的是老实人，没精神的是坏蛋们。”广大劳苦群众从此当了家，选出村级干部，分得了土地，十九户赤贫，十七户贫农，全上升为贫中农与中农，几千年来的封建统治者垮了台。
