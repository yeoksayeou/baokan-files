Xinhua News Agency, Rehe, 16th -- Frontline troops in western and central Rehe penetrated deep behind enemy lines, launching ambushes and attacks. On the 23rd of last month, a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army in western Rehe encountered the Second Company of the 11th Regiment of a certain division of Chiang Kai-shek's 15th Army in a village southeast of Yanqing, Chahar Province. After a fierce battle, the entire company was annihilated. Six American-made machine guns, sixteen submachine guns, two 60mm mortars, and more than thirty rifles were seized. Over seventy Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, including the company commander, were killed or captured. Furthermore, on the 12th of last month, a certain local armed force in western Rehe killed or wounded ×× bandits and their captain at Huangtuliangzi, fifty miles north of Pingquan. After a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army recovered Xinleng and Sanwang, important towns ninety miles north of Weichang, on the 17th of last month, they took advantage of their victory to occupy Qipan Mountain (over ten miles north of Weichang) on the 20th. The people in that area regained their freedom and have been actively denouncing the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's army. On the 25th, a unit of the 22nd Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army, numbering over two hundred men, advanced towards Qiaotou, forty miles north of Chifeng. After a heroic resistance by the Eighth Route Army stationed there, they were defeated and fled back to Chifeng. Over ten enemies were killed, and one submachine gun and two rifles were captured.
