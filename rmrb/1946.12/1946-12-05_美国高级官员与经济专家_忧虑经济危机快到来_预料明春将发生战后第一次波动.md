Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: US senior officials and economic experts are worried about the arrival of an economic crisis. According to a United Press report from Washington on November 13th: "Newly appointed Secretary of Commerce Harriman and other senior officials are studying inflationary trends. Many economic experts predict that the current US prosperity will end in the near future due to the arrival of a recession, as early as six months or as late as a year and a half." Furthermore, according to a Reuters report from Washington on November 17th: "American domestic experts, after studying the national purchasing and production situation, predict that the first post-war economic fluctuation in the United States will occur next spring. The United States has reached a prosperous period, but fluctuations are inevitable sooner or later.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Famous reporter Stein recently wrote: "Diplomatic envoys stationed in Washington have gradually noticed the rapidly complex US economic problems. Their foreign ministries have instructed them to investigate whether the United States is heading towards an economic crisis." Stein pointed out that the recent plunge in New York stocks was a signal of the arrival of an economic crisis. Stein concluded: "Those capitalist countries naturally have absolute reason to fear the arrival of an American economic crisis." Moreover, according to an Associated Press report on November 10th: "Britain today began tightening its economy to prevent shocks from the world economic decline, and the impact on trade after the Republican victory in the United States." The London "Observer" reported: One of the reasons why Labor Party Members of Parliament oppose Bevin's policies is "they believe that Britain's economic connection with the United States will make it difficult for the United States to escape the inevitable trend of capitalism from prosperity to decline."

    【新华社延安一日电】美国高级官员与经济专家正忧虑经济危机之到来。据合众社华府十一月十三日电称：“新任商务部长哈立曼与其他高级官员正研究通货膨胀之趋势，许多经济专家预测目前美国之繁荣在最近期内将因不景气之到来而结束，早则不出六个月，迟则不出一年半。”又据路透社华府十一月十七日电称：“美国国内专家于研究全国之购买及生产情况后，预料明春将发生美国战后之第一次经济波动，目前美国已达蓬勃时期，但波动迟早不免。
    【新华社延安一日电】名记者斯坦因最近著文称：“驻华府的外交使节们，已逐渐注意到急趋复杂的美国经济问题。他们的外交部已训令他们调查美国正走向经济危机的道路吗？”史坦因指出，不久前纽约股票的暴跌，是经济危机到来的信号。史氏结语称：“那些资本主义国家自然有绝对理由为美国的经济危机之到来而恐惧。”又据美联社十一月十日电称：“英国今日开始紧缩经济，以防世界经济衰落之震动，及美国共和党胜利后对于贸易之影响。”伦敦“观察家”报称：英工党下院议员之反对贝文政策的原因之一，为“他们认为英国经济与美国联系，将使美国难逃资本主义之必然趋势由繁荣而至衰落”。
