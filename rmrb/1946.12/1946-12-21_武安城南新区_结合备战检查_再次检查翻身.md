　　Wuan City Southern New District
    Combining War Preparation Inspection
    Re-Inspect the Overturn
    Eliminating Landlords Not Thorough Enough
    The Masses' Bitter Water Has Not Been Poured Out
    [This Newspaper, Wuan News] After initially completing war preparations, each district in the southern new district of this county successively convened meetings of village cadres and Party activist elements. Combining the inspection of war preparations, they conducted a second major inspection of the overturn. Two major problems were discovered in this inspection. First, the elimination of feudalism was not thorough enough, leaving remnants such as: 1. Some reactionary landlord-special agent elements attempted to expand reactionary armed forces and secretly engaged in deceptive activities. 2. Some feudal reactionary elements, in order to escape struggle, infiltrated our production, cultural, educational, financial, and grain departments with false positive appearances. (For example, in the Eighth District, more than 20 struggle targets infiltrated the county government as organ production, and many workers in the ×× cigarette factory were struggle targets.) Some infiltrated the army to intimidate people with "military dependents," or used the army to attack the masses. Because these elements were "engaged in official business," the struggle was often not thorough. 3. Some landlords used false enlightenment or manufactured struggles to deceive the masses. Some retained most of their property by offering trivial items, some landlords encouraged cadres to falsely struggle and protect them in joint struggles based on village localism, and some landlords delayed giving fruits to the masses, etc. 4. A small number of backward cadres and masses protected landlords or preserved things for landlords. For example, a farmers' association cadre in Xidahe protected a landlord surnamed Liu, and a cadre in Dongdahe unconsciously protected a landlord because he had farmed the landlord's land, suffered great exploitation, and took small advantages. Still others relaxed the struggle against some political rulers who were not economically strong because ideological mobilization was insufficient, the masses did not complain, and the bad elements remained active. 5. Big villages were mobilized but natural village small villages were missed, big feudal elements were struggled against but small feudal elements were missed, class boundaries were not distinguished, and the elimination of feudalism was relaxed. These problems have also aroused the vigilance and attention of the masses in some villages. For example, in war preparations, many militiamen put forward slogans such as "Eliminate the 'Homecoming Corps' and capture Yang Si alive." Some exposed the false enlightenment of landlords, saying that they "exploited all the houses and land, and pretended to be good people by giving away clothes and food," and "Even if you are enlightened again and again, I still can't overturn myself." These problems must be given practical attention and continued investigation in the future.
    Insufficient Ideological Mobilization
    Lack of Armed Awareness
    Secondly, the masses' overturn was not thorough enough, leaving loopholes: 1. Some villages still have struggle fruits that have not been distributed, or are wasted randomly as public expenses. For example, the fruits of the struggle in Huyü in August have not been distributed to this day. Some villages divide most of the fruits into three shares: farmers' association, government, and militia, as production funds. Some put the fruits into cooperatives and call it "the farmers' association's share," etc. After inspection, everyone realized that "leaving a pit reduces strength," and proposed "fill the big pit and fill the small pit, it doesn't count as fair if one household is missed," quickly distributed them, and re-supplied those who were not taken care of enough, etc. 2. Times have overturned, but thoughts have not overturned. In some places, ideological mobilization is insufficient, fearing that the landlords will retaliate in the future, wasting the fruits of struggle without knowing that it is their own blood and sweat, and being a militiaman is just for showing off, lacking the awareness of armed overturn. 3. In many villages, cadres still do everything for them, and the masses are not mobilized enough. The landlords are hated only by a few people, the masses have no energy, and the cadres have no roots. Completing work relies mostly on orders, the masses are dissatisfied, and special agents take advantage of the loopholes. 4. Strengthening our own organization is not enough. In the farmers' association and militia during war preparations, a small number of bad elements were purged and a group of good elements were developed, but it is still very poor. Many mass leaders have not yet been promoted to leadership positions, and the women's own organization is still very weak. During the inspection, it was recognized that having a strong organization can consolidate the overturn. After the inspection, it was decided to seize the gaps in the war, completely eliminate feudalism, and complete land reform. Now, more than 100 villages in the southern city have started a "cutting off tails and patching loopholes" Laba Festival movement in tense war preparations. It is proposed that revolution must have a beginning and an end, and the overturn must be thorough. (Wang Tingdong)

　　武安城南新区
    结合备战检查
    再次检查翻身
    消灭地主不够彻底
    群众苦水还没倒完
    【本报武安讯】本县城南新区在初步完成备战之后，各区先后召开村干部与党员活动分子会议，结合检查备战，进行第二次翻身大检查，这次检查中发现两大问题，首先是消灭封建不彻底，还留有尾巴如一、部分反动地主奸特分子企图扩大反动武装，暗中进行欺骗活动。二、一部封建反动分子，为逃避斗争，以假积极面目混入我生产、文教、财粮等部门。（如八区有二十多个斗争对象混入县府作机关生产，××烟厂不少工人为斗争对象。）有些则混入军队以“军属”吓人，或利用军队打击群众。这些分子因“干上公事”，所以斗争多不彻底。三、部分地主以假开明或制造斗争以蒙混群众。有些以拿出点滴东西换得大部财产的保留，有些在联合斗争中，地主以村本位鼓励干部假斗包庇，有些地主拖欠果实不给群众等。四、少数落后干部群众，包庇地主或替地主保存东西。如西大河一个农会干部包庇刘姓地主，东大河一干部因给地主种过地，受了大剥削，占过小便宜，而不自觉就包庇地主。还有些因思想发动不够，对一些经济上虽不雄厚，但政治上是统治人物的斗争对象放松过去，群众没诉苦没出了气，坏分子依然活动。五、发动了大村漏下自然村小庄，斗了大封建漏下小封建，分不清阶级界线，放松了封建的消灭。这些问题在部分村庄也引起群众的警惕和注意，如备战中不少村民兵提出“消灭‘还乡团’、活捉杨四”的口号。有些对假开明地主进行揭露，说他们“房子土地剥削尽、舍衣舍饭装好人”，“你虽一再开明，我却翻不了身”等，这些问题在今后还须切实注意继续清查。
    思想发动不够
    缺乏武装自觉
    其次是群众翻身不彻底，还留着窟窿：一、部分村尚留着斗争果实没分配，或作为公共开支胡乱浪费。如胡峪八月的斗争果实至今没分，有些村把大部果实按农会、政权、民兵三股分作生产基金，有些把果实入合作社叫“农会的股”等，经检查大家认识到“留一个圪道、少一分力量”，提出“填了大坑填小坑，漏下一户不算平”，迅速分配，对照顾不够的重新补给等。二、时光翻了身思想没翻身，有些地方思想发动不够，怕惹下地主将来人家反攻，浪费果实不知是自己的血汗，当民兵只是为出风头，缺乏翻身武装的自觉。三、不少村仍是干部包办代替，群众发动不够，地主被斗只恨少数人，群众没劲干部没根，完成工作多靠命令，群众不满，特务钻空。四、壮大自己的组织不够，备战中农会民兵中清洗了少数坏分子，发展了一批好成份，但还很差。不少群众领袖还没提到领导岗位，妇女本身组织还很薄弱。检查中，认识到有了强大的组织才能巩固翻身时光。经检查后决定抓紧战争空隙，彻底消灭封建，完成土地改革。现城南百余村在紧张备战中又开始了“割尾巴补窟窿”的腊月运动。提出革命要有头有尾，翻身一定要彻底。（王庭栋）
