　　The Battle of Fengshan Xiaodianzi in Northern Jiangsu
    The Annihilation of the Nationalist Army's Pre-3rd Brigade
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 20th] Frontline reporter Liu Liang of Northern Jiangsu reports on the complete annihilation of the invading Nationalist Army's 57th Division's Pre-3rd Brigade (formerly the Pre-3rd Division of the 98th Army) by the New Fourth Army's "Qingdao" unit. The report states: From the night of the 15th to the morning of the 16th, after a night of counterattacks, the New Fourth Army's "Qingdao" unit recovered Fengshan (25 miles north of Suqian) in one battle, completely annihilating a battalion of the 9th Regiment of the Nationalist Army's 57th Division's Pre-3rd Brigade that had occupied the area. Then, taking advantage of the victory, they surrounded Xiaodianzi (5 miles south of Fengshan), where the brigade headquarters and its 7th Regiment were entrenched. By noon on the 17th, the "Qingdao" unit launched a general assault, with mountain guns simultaneously bombarding and hitting their targets. Under the cover and encouragement of the artillery, the infantry bravely charged towards the Nationalist Army, and courageous demolition men continuously blasted through several layers of the Nationalist Army's obstacles, such as deer fences and barbed wire. At this time, the commando team leaped over the trenches amidst the smoke and dust, using hand grenades and bayonets to eliminate the Nationalist Army in the fortifications. Subsequently, a strong force rushed into the breach and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Nationalist Army. The "Qingdao" unit advanced step by step, quickly surrounding the Nationalist Army's Pre-3rd Brigade headquarters located at the southern end of the street. At this point, the Nationalist Army lost all will to fight, and when the "Qingdao" unit approached, they raised their hands to surrender. The battle ended at 11 pm. The soldiers excitedly carried the spoils of war, which were piled up like mountains on the 700-meter-long street. According to preliminary statistics, the Battle of Xiaodianzi resulted in the capture of seven mountain guns, one mortar, two flat trajectory guns, two anti-tank guns, nearly a hundred light and heavy machine guns, and countless rifles. In addition to those killed and wounded, over 2,000 Nationalist soldiers were captured. This is only a part of the results of this large-scale annihilation battle in Northern Jiangsu.

　　苏北峰山晓店子战斗
    预三旅覆灭经过
    【新华社华中二十日电】苏北前线记者刘亮报导新四军“青岛”部队歼灭进犯蒋军五十七师预三旅（原九十八军预三师）全部之经过称：十五日夜至十六日晨，新四军“青岛”部队经一夜反击，收复峰山（宿迁北二十五里）一战，将侵踞该地之蒋军五十七师预三旅九团一个营全部歼灭后，即乘胜包围困守晓店子（峰山南五里）之该旅旅部及所属七团。至十七日中午，“青岛”部队向其发动总攻，成队山炮同时轰击，一一命中目标。在炮兵掩护与鼓舞下，步兵奋勇扑向蒋军，神勇爆破手连续三次爆破蒋军数道鹿寨、铁丝网等障碍。此时突击队即于烟尘弥漫中飞越壕沟，以手榴弹和刺刀将蒋军消灭在工事里。随后，强大部队冲进突破口，与蒋军展开激烈巷战。“青岛”部队逐步前进，迅即包围街南端蒋军预三旅旅部驻屋。蒋军至此士无斗志，当“青岛”部队冲到其近旁时，即纷纷举手缴械。至晚十一时，结束战斗。战士们兴奋的搬运着战利品，在七百多公尺的大街上，堆积如山。据初步统计：晓店子之战，缴获山炮七门，迫击炮一门，平射炮两门，战车防御炮二门，轻重机枪近百挺，步枪无算。除毙伤外，俘蒋军两千余人。这只是此次苏北大歼灭战战果的一部分。
