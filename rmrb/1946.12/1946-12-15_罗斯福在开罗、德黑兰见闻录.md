Roosevelt's Memoirs of Cairo and Tehran
Translated by Yu Caijie
After Talking with Stalin

    That afternoon, Stalin and Molotov came to see Father. Although I had heard that Stalin was shorter than average, I was surprised to learn about some other things about him. Beyond his short stature and calm, profound voice, he had a very charismatic essence; within him was stored immense patience and conviction. Beside him, Molotov was silent.

    In forty-five minutes, Father discussed the Far East and China with him, matters Father had already discussed with Chiang. Father explained Chiang's desire for the Soviet Union to respect the Manchurian border. Stalin said that the world respected the Soviet Union's sovereign integrity, and in turn, he would respect the sovereign integrity of all countries, large and small.

    That evening, Father said he was tired.

    "Want a drink to perk up?" I asked.

    "No, thank you. Stalin is hosting tonight; that means a Russian-style dinner. If our State Department experts don't make any more mistakes, there will be many toasts." He sighed.

    "That man, he gets things done well. It's a pleasure to work with him. No beating around the bush. He outlines the topics he wants to discuss and follows them closely," he said.

    "Is it the crossing of the Strait to attack Europe?" I asked.

    "That's what he's talking about, and what we're talking about."

    "Are the British still raising issues?"

    "Well… now Winston (i.e., Churchill—Editor) is talking about launching two simultaneous actions," Father said, smiling.

    "What does Churchill mean, what are two simultaneous offensives? Dad!"

    "One in the West, and one in a location you know."

    "The Balkans?"

    "Of course!" He laughed heavily. "You know, at the conference, whenever the Prime Minister argues for an offensive in the Balkans, everyone in the room knows what he means. He's anxious to pierce into Central Europe to isolate the Red Army from entering Austria and Romania, and possibly Hungary. And Uncle Joe, when he discusses the military convenience of an offensive on the Western Front and the inadvisability of dispersing forces, he's always aware of the political implications. But he never mentions them."

    "Elliot, our chiefs of staff believe that the way to kill the most Germans with the least loss of American lives is to launch a massive offensive. Then use everything we have to defeat them. That makes sense to me. It makes sense to Uncle Joe too. That's the fastest way to win the war."

    "The difficulty is," he continued, "that the Prime Minister is thinking too much about the post-war period, thinking too much about Britain's future position. He doesn't want the Russians to be too strong. Or that the Russians will be very strong in Europe. Whether that's bad depends on many factors. What I'm grasping at is a way to reduce American deaths, and the fastest way to end the war is to attack from the West, and only from the West, and that's the only way." He grinned and added, "I don't see any reason to put American soldiers in harm's way to defend all of Britain's real or imagined interests in Europe."

At a Russian-style Banquet

    The rumors about Russian banquets are true. Of course, there's "Vodka" first, and if you're lucky, there's also a good white wine. I say lucky because it only comes halfway through the banquet. In that case, "Vodka" is your terrible companion. (Translator's note: because the alcohol content is too strong.) But I noticed that Stalin was drinking "Vodka" from beginning to end.

    Towards the end of the banquet, Stalin stood up to propose the tenth toast. I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was roughly these words:

    "I propose a toast to the possibility of the fairest and quickest trial of all German war criminals—trying them in front of a firing squad—I propose a toast to our unity in arresting them, executing them, all of them, at least 50,000 people."

    Quick as a flash, Churchill stood up. He had been drinking his beloved brandy, so his tongue seemed even thicker.

    "Any such attitude," the Prime Minister shouted, "is completely contrary to our British sense of fairness! The British people will never condone such mass slaughter! I take this opportunity to say that I strongly feel that no one, Nazi or otherwise, should be summarily executed in front of a firing squad without a proper tribunal!"

    I looked at Stalin. He seemed offended, but his expression remained solemn. Only his eyes were flashing as he accepted the Prime Minister's challenge, coaxing him to continue, gently piercing his arguments, seemingly unconcerned that Churchill was already desperately throwing a tantrum.

    Finally, Father said, "Clearly, there must be a compromise here." He suppressed a laugh. "Or, we shall say, if we are not summarily executing 50,000 war criminals, we will agree to a smaller number. Can we say 49,400?"

    The Americans and Russians laughed loudly. And the British, given the Prime Minister's fury, could only sit quietly with long faces. I thought Stalin would be satisfied and change the subject. But he insisted on continuing, he asked for my opinion.

    "Well," I said, "isn't the whole thing rather academic? Russian, American and British soldiers will decide the fate of most of these 50,000 during the war. And I hope that not only these 50,000 war criminals will be noticed, but also the hundreds of thousands of Nazis should be noticed." I began to sit down.

    But suddenly, an angry finger was wagging over my head.

    "Are you interested in destroying relations between the Allies? Do you know what you are saying? How dare you say such a thing?" It was Churchill, he was so furious that he made no secret of it. We sat in shocked silence. Fortunately, the dinner ended quickly, and I ran to Father's room to ask for forgiveness.

    He roared with laughter: "Don't think about him anymore. Winston lost his head, no one takes that question seriously. Uncle Joe needled him, and he had to take the offensive against someone else. Don't worry, Winston will forget about it when he wakes up." However, I now think he did not forget. Clearly Mr. Churchill never forgets! (To be continued)

    罗斯福在开罗、德黑兰见闻录
    余才节译
    和斯大林对谈之后
    这个下午，斯大林和莫洛托夫来看父亲。虽然听说斯大林比常人矮，我惊异地了解到关于他的别一些情形。在他矮的身材和沉着深刻的声音之外，他有一种非常有魄力的本质；在他内部蕴蓄着巨大的忍耐力和确信。在他旁边，莫洛托夫是沉默的。
    四十五分钟内，父亲和他讨论到远东、中国，那些事父亲已和蒋讨论过的。父亲解释蒋的渴望苏联尊重满洲边界。斯大林说世界尊重苏联的主权完整，反过来看，他也将尊重大小各国的主权完整。
    这晚上，父亲诉说他是疲倦了。
    “喝酒振作一下吗？”我问。
    “不要，谢谢。斯大林今晚做东道主；意思是俄式晚餐。如果我们国务院的专家们不再犯错误，那么，会有许多道举杯祝饮的。”他叹了一口气。
    “那个人，他把事情做得好哩。和他一同工作是一种愉快。一点不绕弯子。他把想讨论的主题排清了大纲，紧跟着走。”他说。
    “渡峡攻欧吗？”我问。
    “这是他在谈论着，也是我们谈论着的事”。
    “英国人还在提出问题来吗？”
    “这……现在文斯登（即邱吉尔——编者）又正在说两个动作同时发动的事。”父亲笑着说。
    “邱吉尔是什么意思，什么是两个进攻同时发动？爸爸！”
    “一个在西方，一个在你知道的地点。”
    “巴尔干吗？”
    “当然啦！”他笑得很沉重，“你知道在大会上，不论何时首相论争着在巴尔干进攻，那么房间内不论那个人都很明白他的意思是什么。这是说，他焦急的穿刺进中欧，以求隔绝红军进入奥地利和罗马尼亚，可能时还有匈牙利。而约瑟叔叔呢，当他讨论到西线进攻的军事便利，及分散兵力的不足为训时，他也是常意识到政治意义的。但，从不提到。”
    “伊利奥特，我们的参谋首长坚信：用最少美国兵员的损失，去杀伤最多的德国人的方法，便是去发动一个巨大的大攻势。然后用我们所能有的去杀败他们。这对我是有意义的。对约瑟叔叔也有意义。这是赢取战争的最快的一条路。”
    “困难的是，”他继续说：“这首相在想着战后的事太多，在想着将来英国的处境太多。他不愿让俄国人太强。或者，俄国人将在欧洲很强。是否这是坏的，要看许多因素。我所把握的一件事是求减少美国死亡的方法，也是求最快的结束战争的方法，便是从西方进攻，而且单从西方进攻，而且这是唯一条路。”他露齿地笑着再说：“我看不到有什么理由置美国兵士于险地，以求保卫英国在欧洲所有真实的或幻想中的利益。”
  俄国式的宴会上
    关于俄国宴会的传闻，真不虚传。当然先是“伏特加”，幸运时还有一种好的白酒。我说幸运地，是因为只在宴会半中间才有。在这种情况下，“伏特加”便是你糟透的伴侣。（译注：因为酒性太猛烈。）但我注意到斯大林是自始至终喝着“伏特加”。
    到宴会将终，斯大林站起作第十几次的举杯祝饮。我不记他是怎样说的，大致是这些话：
    “我提议祝饮为了可能最快地公平审判所有德国战争罪犯——在执行枪决的队伍面前审判他们——我祝饮为了我们团结，以求逮捕他们，处决他们，他们全体，至少将有五万个人。”
    快到像闪光一样，邱吉尔站了起来。他本来一直在喝着他心爱的白兰地酒，所以舌头似乎更厚了一些。
    “任何这种态度”，首相喊道：“是完全和我们不列颠公平意义相违反的！不列颠人民从不赞成这种成群屠杀！我趁这机会说，我强烈地感觉到，没有一个人，纳粹或否，将被概括地在执行枪决的队伍面前处决，而不经过适当的法庭审询！”
    我看看斯大林。他似乎被人触犯了，但脸色仍然庄严地。只有眼睛闪着光，他接受了首相的挑战，逗他讲下去，和蔼地穿刺进他的议论，似乎毫不在乎邱吉尔已绝望地在发脾气。
    最后父亲说：“显然啊，这儿必定有个折衷之道。”他忍住了笑，“或者，我们将说，如果不是概括地处决五万个战犯，我们将同意一个较小的数目。我们能否说是五万九千四百个呢？”
    美国人和俄国人都大笑。而英国人，有鉴于首相的盛怒，只得静静地坐着，拉长了脸。我想斯大林会满意而换题目了。但他坚持下去，他问我的意见。
    “好，”我说：“全部事情是否很学术性呢？俄国、美国和英国的兵士们将在战争中决定这五万人中大部分的结局。而我希望不只是这些五万个战犯将被注意到，那成百成千纳粹们也该注意到。”我开始坐下。
    但突然地，一个怒意的手指在我头上摇动。
    “你是有兴趣于毁坏盟国间的关系吗？你知道你在说了些什么？你怎么敢这样呢？”这是邱吉尔，他盛怒已极，所以毫不掩饰了。我们惊骇地静坐着。幸而，这晚餐很快完了，我跑到父亲房间中请求宽恕。
    他大声吼笑起来：“不再想到他。文斯登失去了头脑，谁也不把那问题认真的看。约瑟叔叔针刺了他，他只得对别的人采取攻势。不要在意，文斯登睡醒后便会忘记的。”然而我现在想他并未忘记。显然邱吉尔先生永不忘记！（续完）
