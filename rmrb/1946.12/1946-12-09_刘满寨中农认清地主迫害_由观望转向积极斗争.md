　　【Benbao Weixian Seventh Dispatch】 Having realized that middle peasants suffered greatly under landlord rule, the middle peasants of Liu Manzhai have changed from observing the mass movement to actively struggling. During the struggle against unlawful landlords Hu Menglin and Li Cuiwu in the second district of Qi, most of the middle peasants were watching, and the middle peasants participating in the farmers' association were not very enthusiastic. Some middle peasants joined the farmers' association to avoid struggle. Later, during the struggle against the local tyrant landlord Li Youshan, when they traced back to 1940 when they organized aid to the enemy, the middle peasants provided the most labor while the landlords provided none at all. This greatly angered the middle peasants. Some said, "We middle peasants have suffered such great losses, how can we not be poor?" The village cadres seized the opportunity to educate all the middle peasants, pointing out that when the landlords are in power, the middle peasants suffer losses everywhere. If the Communist Party had not come, the middle peasants' property would have been exploited by the landlords long ago. Only when the Communist Party comes can the middle peasants become cadres and have status. The fair burden sharing method greatly benefited the middle peasants. It was also pointed out that the middle and poor peasants are one family, and only by uniting can they defeat the local tyrant landlords. The middle peasants all have land now, but they can still be given property. As a result, the thinking of the middle peasants was cleared. Some said, "I used to think we were just fighting anyone who had land, but now I know that fighting sinful landlords is not unjust at all." Some said, "I used to be afraid of struggle, but what am I afraid of now? Let's do it!" Currently, middle peasants are joining the farmers' association one after another and are struggling against the local tyrant landlords.

　　刘满寨中农认清地主迫害
    由观望转向积极斗争
    【本报威县七日电】认识了地主统治时中农大受迫害，刘满寨中农对群运由观望变积极斗争。企之二区刘满寨在斗争不法地主胡梦林、李萃五时，大部中农观望，参加农会的中农劲头也不大，有的中农参加农会是为了避免斗争。后来斗争恶霸地主李有善时，追到一九四○年他们组织资敌时，中农出夫最多，地主根本不出，这大大激愤了中农，有的说：“咱中农吃了这么大的亏，还怎能不穷？”村干部抓紧机会教育全体中农，指出：地主掌权，中农处处吃亏，不是共产党来，中农的东西早被地主剥削干净了。共产党来了，中农才能当干部，才有了地位。公平负担办法，中农沾了大光。又指出：中贫农是一家，只有团结起来，才能打垮恶霸地主。中农都有地了，但可以分得资财。结果打通了中农思想。有的说：“以前我当是谁有地斗谁，现在才知道斗有罪恶的地主，那一点也不冤”。有的说：“俺以前光害怕斗争，现在还害啥怕呢？干吧！”目前中农纷纷参加农会，向恶霸地主进行斗争。
