Southern Hebei Winter Study About to Unfold
    [This newspaper's Weixian 16th dispatch] To seize the time and raise the awareness of the peasants, the winter study movement in various parts of southern Hebei is about to unfold. The Pingxiang Propaganda and Education Joint Conference determined that it is necessary to enlighten and educate the masses through winter study, and strive to promote the masses and war preparation work with winter study. The county has now gathered more than 300 people who are undergoing training. Jize has gathered 400 people for training, and determined that this year's winter study will focus on improving the political awareness of the masses. Yongzhi will establish mass blackboards and literacy cards in the winter study movement. The Fifth Prefectural Committee's winter study movement instructions emphasized: (1) Winter study is a school run by the peasant association itself, and its teaching content, time, and organization should all start from the needs of the peasants. (2) The qualifications of winter study teachers should be based on political quality. The first phase of winter training in Julu County has been completed, and 151 winter study teachers have gone down to promote it, and launched a discussion among the students on how to divide the class, in coordination with the investigation and rent reduction movement.
