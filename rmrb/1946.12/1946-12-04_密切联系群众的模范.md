　　Model of Close Ties with the Masses
    Today's newspaper reports how the comrades of the Fifth Company, First Platoon of Unit 6047, pay attention to implementing mass discipline and how they conduct mass work in an area unfamiliar to us. Their excellent work style of highly valuing the mass viewpoint and proceeding from reality, as well as earnestly implementing the spirit of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, is worthy of praise and learning!
    They found ways to explain two problems to us: First, regarding the masses, especially the peasant masses, we must always pay attention to enlightening them with practical actions. The masses in the area where the First Platoon arrived had never seen our army before. Although they had heard that our army was good, they had not seen it or experienced it, and they did not know enough about us. In response to this situation, the First Platoon first paid attention to the smallest issues, such as sweeping the floor, cleaning the courtyard, washing pots, and carrying water after meals, so that the masses knew that we were indeed good and dared to approach us, and then carried out propaganda and achieved significant results. Second, what issues to talk about. The comrades of the First Platoon carried out propaganda based on what they understood. This not only avoids the problem of being formulaic but also makes the talks more vivid and profound because they are based on what each person is familiar with, and it also easily meets the needs of the masses.
    Paying attention to mass work is the fine tradition of our People's Army and the key to strengthening our ties with the masses. In the self-defense war, many models of discipline have continuously emerged in various units. They have been praised by their leaders and loved by the broad masses. However, we must continue to promote this glorious tradition, always pay attention to implementing the teachings of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, strictly abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention for the people, and closely integrate with the masses at all times and in all places, in order to strive for an early victory in the patriotic self-defense war.

　　密切联系群众的模范
    今天报载六○四七部队五连一排的同志们，如何注意执行群众纪律及如何在一个不熟悉我们的地区进行群众工作。他们这种高度群众观点从实际出发的优良作风，及切实实行三大纪律八项注意的精神，是值得表扬与学习的！
    他们想办法给我们说明两个问题：第一是对于群众，尤其是农民群众，必须时刻注意用实际行动去启发他们。一排同志们所到地区的群众，从来没见过我们的军队，虽然他们听说过我们军队好，但他们没有看见到没有体验到，对我们还不够了解。一排同志针对这种情况，首先注意最微小的问题，比如扫地清院，饭后洗锅挑水等等，让群众知道我们确实是好，敢于接近我们，然后进行宣传而得到显著效果。第二是谈些什么问题。一排同志们，是根据各人所了解的东西进行宣传，这不仅可免掉千篇一律的毛病，而且按各人所熟悉的去谈，谈起来会更生动深刻，同时也容易满足群众的要求。
    注意群众工作，是我们人民军队的优良传统，是我们加强与群众联系的关键。在自卫战争中，各个部队已不断涌现许多守纪模范，他们受到首长的表扬和广大群众的爱戴。但是我们还要继续发扬这个光荣传统，时刻注意实行毛主席、朱总司令对我们的教训，对于人民严守三大纪律八项注意，不论任何地方任何时候，都紧密结合群众，以争取爱国自卫战争早日胜利。
