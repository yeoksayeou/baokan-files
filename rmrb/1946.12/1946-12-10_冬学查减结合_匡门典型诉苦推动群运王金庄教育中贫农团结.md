    Winter School Combines Investigation and Rent Reduction
　　Kuangmen Typical Grievance Meeting Promotes Mass Movement; Wangjinzhuang Educates and Unites Poor Peasants
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi 7th Dispatch] In She County's Kuangmen, the typical grievance meeting in the winter school enlightened the masses, influenced the confession of deceived "lackeys," and vigorously promoted investigation and rent reduction. Wang Tongshun recounted in the winter school how his father and sons had suffered under landlords Wang Xushun and others for more than fifty years, and were still poor. Because they revealed two strings of cash, they couldn't afford the interest, and his mother worked as a cook for others for six years. In the famine of 1920, they sold his own brother for five strings of cash, and the whole family relied on a barren hillside land, which was also seized by Wang Xushun. The typical grievance meeting enlightened many people, and they all wanted to complain in the winter school. Yang Fengxing and Shen Lintai, who were deceived into informing the landlord and secretly stealing things, were enlightened by listening to the grievance meeting and voluntarily confessed in the winter school. Their confession influenced eighteen deceived "lackeys" to confess and change, strengthening the unity of the peasants. A fierce struggle of reasoning with the landlords was launched, and after six or seven days of reckoning, the landlords were at a loss for words, and the peasants finally recovered the fruits of their blood and sweat. In the movement, lessons were learned from last year, the policy of uniting the middle peasants was earnestly implemented, the peasant association organization was rectified through an activists' meeting, more than 150 middle peasant households participated in the movement, and attention was paid to mobilizing women, with a total of 234 women joining the peasant association.

    [Another Dispatch] After returning from the county cadre expansion meeting in November, the cadres of Wangjinzhuang conducted an in-depth investigation and found that the feudal remnants of landlords Liu Shuxiang and Wang Zenshou, two old rich peasants, had not been cut off. The masses unanimously demanded a mass meeting and a struggle and reckoning with the landlords. It was convenient to carry out the grievance meeting on November 8th. Before the lights were turned on, the masses crowded at the entrance of the winter school, and the masses themselves selected volunteer teachers, and the grievance meeting began. In the first three days, poor peasants eagerly requested enrollment because they had a belly full of grievances to pour out. The poor peasants then brought up the blood and sweat accounts of being exploited and oppressed by the landlords. But at this time, some middle peasants were terrified, and some stopped production, waiting to be struggled against by the masses. Comrade Fu Zhou, the director of the peasant association, saw this problem and immediately conducted policy education in the winter school, dividing the classes and allowing the masses to boldly expose their confused thoughts. At this time, the middle peasants expressed their fears, and after the class division, the middle peasants clarified their class and became active in attending winter school. At this time, the more people attended winter school, the more volunteer teacher Liu Lanfang, with the consent of the masses, divided the winter school into several places to attend. All 721 people in the village attended winter school and discussed how to combine cultural learning. In addition, in order to absorb the experience of this year's production movement, discover typical examples, cultivate models, and promote the general, the movement was promoted. It was decided to start with the third street of labor hero Cao Shankui first. Specific steps: first investigate illiteracy, and then organize into four groups to carry out the work. Students who know less than fifty characters mainly learn characters, and use new characters learned at the center of the task. For example, to complain, learn the two characters "suku" (诉苦, complain). Production learns the names of agricultural tools. Those who know more than fifty characters learn and use at the same time, such as taking notes on matters discussed every day. Third grade students in elementary school go to winter school as little teachers. Finally, they also decided to conduct a summary every ten days and select model figures for winter school.

    冬学查减结合
　　匡门典型诉苦推动群运王金庄教育中贫农团结
    【本报长治七日电】涉县匡门经过冬学典型诉苦，启发了群众觉悟，影响被骗“狗腿”坦白，查减猛烈开展。王同顺在冬学诉说他父子三人给地主王序顺等受了五十多年苦，还是穷人。因为揭下两串钱，出不起利，其母给人家做了六年饭。民国九年闹灾荒，把亲哥卖了五串钱，全家靠着生活的一处荒坡地，也被王序顺夺了。典型诉苦启发了很多人，都要到冬学诉苦，杨凤行、申林太因受欺骗给地主报信偷捣东西，听诉苦受到启发，自动到冬学里坦白了。他俩的坦白影响十八个被骗的“狗腿”都跟着坦白转变了，农民的团结加强了。猛烈的向地主展开说理斗争，经过六七天的清算，地主理屈，农民终于收回了自己的血汗果实。运动中接受去年教训，认真的执行团结中农政策，经过积极分子会议整顿了农会组织，有一百五十余户中农参加了运动，并注意发动妇女群众，共有二百三十四个妇女加入农会。（正巡、全勋、如香）
    【又讯】王金庄干部从十一月参加县扩干会回来深入进行了调查，发现地主刘书详、王增寿两户老富农等封建尾巴还没割掉。群众一致要求开大会和地主斗争清算，便于十一月八日进行诉苦，未点上灯，群众就挤到冬学门口等着，群众自己选出了义务教员，诉苦就开始了。在头三天贫农入学要求迫切，因为他们装着一肚冤枉要倒，贫农便将受地主剥削压迫的血汗账提出来。但这时一部分中农吓的不得了，有的停住了生产，等着叫群众斗。农会主任傅周同志看到这问题，就马上在冬学里进行政策教育，划分阶层，让群众大胆的暴露糊涂思想。这时中农便把自己怕的思想说出，经过划分阶层，中农明确了自己的阶层，对上冬学便积极了。这时上冬学的人越多，义务教员刘兰芳，得到了群众的同意，便把冬学分成数处来上，全村七百二十一人上冬学，并讨论了如何结合文化学习。此外为了吸收今年生产运动中的经验，发现典型，培养模范推动一般，推动运动。大家决定先从劳动英雄曹善魁的第三街着手搞。具体步骤：先调查文盲，在组织上分四组进行，识五十字以下的主要学生字，以中心工作拟定生字学，如诉苦，就学“诉苦”二字。生产学农具名称。识五十字以上的，一面学一面用，如每天讨论的事记笔记。小学里的三年级学生，到冬学里当小先生。最后他们还决定，每十天头上进行一次总结，选拔冬学模范人物。（郭忠、芬廷）
