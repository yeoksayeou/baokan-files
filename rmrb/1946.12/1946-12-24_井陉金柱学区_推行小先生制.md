　　Jingxing Jinzhu School District
    Promotes the "Little Teacher" System

    [Our Newspaper] In order to carry out winter elementary education, the Jinzhu School District of Jingxing convened a teacher's meeting in the middle of last month and decided to use the "Little Teacher" system to solve the problem of the district's eight teachers teaching more than 1,000 school-age children. Three outstanding students were selected from every 100 children to serve as "Little Teachers," totaling 34. To improve the teaching ability of the "Little Teachers," the school district held a five-day training session for them. Now, the "Little Teachers" have returned to their respective villages to begin their work.
