　　Compensation for Losses, Rejecting Land Donation
    The United and Prosperous Middle Peasants of Wu Song Village
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 7th dispatch] During the rent reduction campaign in Wu Song Village, Qinghe District, one rich middle peasant household was struggled against and fined two mu of land. As a result, three rich middle peasant households offered to "donate land." Just at this time, a village cadre joint meeting was held, conveying and discussing the issue that those who harmed the interests of middle peasants must be compensated, and the issue of stopping land donations from middle peasants. The village cadres resolved their thinking, and immediately convened a village peasant association member meeting. After the Peasant Association Director Wu Biao Duo delivered an enlightening speech, all members immediately launched a heated discussion. As a result, they all agreed to compensate the rich middle peasant for the two mu of land that had been penalized, and explained the situation to them. At the same time, it was decided that the land donations from the three rich middle peasant households would not be accepted, and they would be absorbed into the association to participate in the struggle. As a result, all the rich middle peasants in the village became happy and actively participated in the peasant association.
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 5th dispatch] After a earth-shaking mass movement in Cheng Village, Third District of Jincheng, the peasants have recovered their land from the hands of feudal forces, and completely completed the land reform. The village has a total of 2,138 mu of land, of which middle and poor peasants already own 2,013 mu, averaging 3 to 5 mu per person. The original 74 middle peasant households have now increased to 122 households, and all 48 poor peasant households have risen to become middle peasants. The peasants have obtained land, and their production enthusiasm is very high. Zhang Mingsuo's family of eight used to harvest three shi of grain each year, but this year they harvested thirty shi, averaging three shi seven dou and five sheng per person, and their lives are gradually becoming prosperous.

　　补偿损失拒受献田
    武宋庄团结富裕中农
    【本报威县七日电】清河一区武宋庄查减时，斗争了一户富裕中农，并罚地二亩。结果三户富裕中农提出“献田”。恰好这时开村干联席会，传达与讨论了损害中农利益者必须补救，和停止中农献田问题。该村干部打通了思想，随即召开本村农会员大会，检讨斗争偏向，农会主任武杓铎启发发言后，全体会员当即展开热烈讨论，结果都同意将处罚富中农的二亩地，予以补偿，并向其解释。同时决定三户富中农的献田一概不要，并吸收他们入会，参加斗争。这样一来，全村富中农都高兴起来，踊跃参加农会。
    【本报太岳五日电】晋城三区成庄经过一次翻天覆地的群众运动，农民已从封建势力手中收回自己土地，彻底完成了土地改革。该村共有土地二千一百三十八亩，中贫农已占有二千零一十三亩，每人平均三亩至五亩。原有中农七十四户，现增至一百二十二户，贫农四十八户则全部上升为中农。农民得到了土地，生产情绪很高，张明锁八口人过去每年打粮三石，今年打了三十石，每人平均三石七斗五升，生活逐渐富裕。
