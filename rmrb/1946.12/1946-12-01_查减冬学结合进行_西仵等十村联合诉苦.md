　　Combine Investigation and Rent Reduction with Winter Study
    Ten Villages Including Xi Wu Jointly Complain of Suffering
    [Report from this newspaper] In mid-last month, Si Wu Village, First District of Licheng County, launched a general liquidation movement during the investigation and rent reduction. Although the village had undergone rent reduction and interest rate lowering, anti-local tyrant struggles, and other movements in recent years, the evil, illegal landlords were still secretly ruling and exploiting the masses, and many peasants had not completely turned over. On the 14th of last month, old hired laborer Zhang Shiqin tearfully recounted his decades of suffering in the winter school. He was already over fifty years old and had been a hired laborer for thirty years, yet he still hadn't turned over. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, he borrowed twelve yuan from the landlord Hua Lao Zhen, and the principal and interest snowballed to one hundred and twenty yuan in one year. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, he couldn't cope with the landlord's debt-collecting, so he fled to Weizi Town in Lucheng, changed his name, and became a tile maker. He earned ninety yuan in three years and returned it to Hua Lao Zhen, but it wasn't enough, so he worked as a hired laborer for Hua for another year for free. In the end, the landlord owed Zhang two yuan, but the principal and interest have not been paid to this day. After Zhang Shiqin's tearful complaints, many people were inspired to come to the winter school to complain, all clamoring to "pour out all the bitterness and thoroughly turn over." On the 20th, the oppressed and exploited masses from twelve villages near Xi Wu Village gathered in Xi Wu Village to launch a general liquidation struggle against the evil landlords Hua Lao Zhen, Hua Lan Tai, the KMT special agent landlord Liu Guang Han, and four other households. Many peasants and women poured out the bitterness they hadn't poured out during the rent reduction and interest rate lowering movement over the years, accusing the evil landlords of their crimes. Hua Lan Tai's sister-in-law, encouraged by the masses' determination to thoroughly turn over, recounted the heartbreaking matter of being raped by Hua Lan Tai, which she had never dared to tell anyone. The young man Sun Xiting cried bitterly, accusing the KMT special agent landlord Liu Guang Han of deceiving him into joining the Kuomintang secret service organization. He said, "Liu Guang Han told me: 'The Communist Party does not protect human rights,' but my father was forced to death by him." He raised his fist and cried out in pain, "I became a secret agent and let down the masses. It's all Liu Guang Han's fault. I want to avenge myself and my father!" The masses in the entire venue vied to accuse Hua, Liu, and others of their crimes, raising a total of one hundred and eight issues related to tenancy, debt, local tyranny, etc. Hua and others were at a loss for words and had to admit to compensating the masses for their losses.

　　查减冬学结合进行
    西仵等十村联合诉苦
    【本报讯】上月中旬黎城一区四仵村在查减中展开总清算运动。该村虽经过几年来减租增资、反恶霸斗争等运动，但恶霸不法地主仍在暗中统治剥削群众，许多农民亦并未彻底翻身。上月十四日老雇工张石琴在冬学里哭诉他几十年来的痛苦。他已经五十多岁，整整当了三十年雇工，到现在还没有翻身。民国八年他揭地主花老振十二元钱，一年本利就滚成百二十元，腊月三十因地主逼帐无法应付，乃逃到潞城微子镇改名换姓当了瓦匠，三年赚回九十元还了花老振，不够，又给他白当了一年雇工，最后地主倒欠张两元却至今本利未给。张石琴涕泪交流的诉苦后，启发了许多人到冬学诉苦，都嚷着要“倒尽苦水翻透身”。二十日，西仵村附近十二村受压迫剥削的群众齐集西仵村，展开了对恶霸地主花老振、花兰台、蒋特地主刘光汉等四户的总清算斗争。许多农民和妇女在会上倒出了几年来在减租减息运动中没有倒出的苦水，控诉恶霸罪恶，花兰台的小姨子为群众彻底翻身情绪所鼓舞，诉出了从来不肯对人言的被花兰台强奸的痛心事，青年孙喜廷嚎啕大哭，控诉蒋特地主刘光汉欺骗他参加了国民党特务组织的罪恶，他说：“刘光汉对我说：‘共产党不保障人权’，可是俺爹倒被他逼死了。”他举拳痛呼：“我当了特务对不起群众，都是刘光汉害的，我要给俺自己和俺爹报仇！”全场群众争相控诉花、刘等人罪恶，共提出租佃、债务、恶霸等问题一百零八件，花等理屈词穷，只得承认赔偿群众损失。
