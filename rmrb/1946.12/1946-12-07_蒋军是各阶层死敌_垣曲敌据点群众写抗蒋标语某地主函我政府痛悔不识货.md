[This dispatch from our newspaper] Taiyue, 2nd [of the month]. The Chiang Kai-shek troops’ exorbitant taxes and levies on the people in the occupied areas of Yuanqu have caused unbearable suffering to people of all classes. A small mountain village in Beigou, with only a few households, was burdened with 500,000 [yuan] in taxes in just two installments, along with 200 jin of cotton, 26.2 shi of grain, and 55 pairs each of shoes and socks. As the common people have no legal tender, the Chiang Kai-shek troops stipulated that one shi of wheat could be exchanged for 3,000 yuan in legal tender (the market price is 16,000 yuan). This cruel exploitation has pushed the people of Yuanqu to the end of their rope. On the walls of the Chiang Kai-shek strongholds and bunkers in Tumacun, Beiyang, and other places, slogans such as "Life was most bitter under the Japanese in the past, today Chiang Kai-shek's troops bring even deeper pain," and "We will not rest until we exterminate Chiang Kai-shek's troops" are constantly appearing. The common people in the Xixingma Village area pray to the gods every day, hoping for "the return of the Eighth Route Army." A landlord named Li ×× from a certain town who was lured back recently wrote to the Third District Office of our government to appeal for justice, saying, "It's not that I didn't know the goods, but I was afraid to compare the goods; I really suffered from fantasizing about them (referring to the Central Army)." Landlords in the area, unable to bear the exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, are fleeing to the liberated areas one after another.

　　蒋军是各阶层死敌
    垣曲敌据点群众写抗蒋标语某地主函我政府痛悔不识货
    【本报太岳二日电】蒋军对垣曲侵占区人民横征暴敛，各阶层人民痛苦不堪。北沟一闾人家的小山村，仅两次负担即达五十万元，棉花二百斤，粮食二十六石二斗，鞋袜各五十五双。老百姓没有法币，蒋军即规定一石麦顶法币三千元（市价一万六千元）。这种残酷的压榨，已使垣曲人民山穷水尽。土马村、北杨等蒋军据点和碉堡的墙壁不断发现：“昔年日本在命最苦，今日蒋军来痛更深”，“不灭蒋军誓不休”等标语。西型马村一带老百姓每天求神问卦的盼望“八路军回来”。被诱回去的某镇地主李××最近给我三区区公所来信申冤，并说：“不怕不识货，但怕货比货，我真吃了幻想他们（指中央军）的亏。”该地地主因不堪蒋军的压榨，纷纷向解放区逃来。
