The entrance to Ziliqian Street at the venue was a towering Hero Gate. Four tall yellow cement pillars stood in a row, soaring into the sky. The two middle pillars were spaced two zhang apart, connected by the bright red characters "Hero Gate" as a lintel. Below the characters was a two-zhang-wide eagle with outstretched wings, symbolizing the heroic posture of the masses. Above the rostrum hung portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as portraits of border region leaders Liu, Deng, Yang, and Rong. Two red silk banners above and below the stage read "Opening Ceremony of the Second Heroes' Congress of the Taihang District" and "Ceremony Celebrating the Sixtieth Birthday of Commander-in-Chief Zhu." The venue was surrounded by large red slogans such as "Heroic Undertakings, Mass Style" and "Intensify Preparations for a Counter-Offensive and Smash the Attack of the Traitor Chiang Kai-shek." Directly facing the rostrum was a large portrait of Chairman Mao, with a flagpole and flag-raising platform in front of the portrait. At 3:00 PM, after more than 30,000 people marched into the venue in formation, Chairman Yang, Director Li, Comrade Li Xuefeng, and others also accompanied Commander Chen and other guests into the venue. All the heroes and models, wearing bright red flowers and conference badges, marched in three columns under the guidance of the conference staff. At this time, the band and bayin ensemble played welcome music, the whole audience stood up, applause roared, and the forest of flags was raised high, with cheers shaking the earth. Chairman Yang, the region's party, government, and military leaders, and guests stood in front of the rostrum to pay tribute and welcome the heroes. At this time, the camera was also clicking, and the photographers were busy capturing the grand scene of the heroes' entrance.

At 4:00 PM, the grand ceremony began with salutes and music. After the flag was raised, the congress passed a resolution to form a presidium composed of Chairman Yang, Director Li Yiqing, Commander Qin, Comrade Li Xuefeng, Deputy Political Commissar Wang Weigang, Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Comrade Leng Chu, Director Yang of the Military Affairs Committee, Councilor Wang Lianghong, Mayor Huo of Changshi, County Magistrate Hou of Changzhi County, Comrade Wu Lizhen, and several heroes. Director Li delivered the opening speech, stating briefly: After the first Heroes' Congress, our heroic cause has achieved a counter-offensive victory. After the second congress, we must make greater efforts and carry out a counter-offensive against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek with greater heroic undertakings, and strive for greater victories! Director Li firmly said: "Past victories are ours, and future victories will also be ours." Director Li then announced that November 29th was Commander-in-Chief Zhu's sixtieth birthday, and we want to celebrate the boundless longevity of the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, the Democratic Allied Army, the militia, and all the people's armed forces in the liberated areas, who leads us to defeat Chiang Kai-shek. At this point, the congress held a birthday celebration ceremony. A giant portrait of Commander-in-Chief Zhu appeared on the rostrum, and the whole audience stood in solemn silence, firing salutes and playing music. The Peking University Art Troupe also specially sang a birthday song. After the ceremony, Deputy Political Commissar Wang reported on Commander-in-Chief Zhu's history of fighting for the liberation of the Chinese people for sixty years, and the poet Gang Fulang recited a birthday poem. The heroes proposed sending a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Zhu to express their respect and wish him boundless longevity, which was passed by the whole audience. The birthday celebration ended, and the congress speech was concluded. Next, flags and gifts were presented to the heroes. After the presidium representatives accepted the gifts on behalf of the heroes, Director Li accompanied the labor emancipation heroes and Director Yang Diankui accompanied the enemy-killing heroes to lead the masses on a parade, and then went to the production and militia exhibition halls for ribbon-cutting ceremonies.
