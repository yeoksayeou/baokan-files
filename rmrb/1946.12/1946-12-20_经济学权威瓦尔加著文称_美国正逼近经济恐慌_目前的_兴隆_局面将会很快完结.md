Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 17th: Soviet Academy of Sciences researcher Varga wrote in "Pravda" on November 27th:

At a time when the United States is experiencing something it has never experienced before, perhaps the greatest "boom" ever, fear of an approaching new economic panic is rapidly growing in the capitalist world.

This fear is entirely justified. All capitalist countries that fought in the war, except for the United States and Canada, which profited from the war, are much poorer than before the war. Britain has lost about 25 percent of its national wealth at home and abroad, and Germany has lost about half of its wealth. In European countries, production is only equivalent to 10 to 80 percent of pre-war levels. The high or low percentage depends on the degree of war damage. Therefore, production is much less than during the worst periods of panic.

The United States stands in stark contrast to the ravaged European continent. It emerged from the war with increased wealth.

In 1946, U.S. industrial production exceeded that of 1938 by more than 50 percent, thus reaching a "boom" level. During the war, U.S. production more than doubled compared to 1939. This increase in production enabled the United States not only to meet the demands of the war, but also to meet the needs of the people. In addition, the United States has accumulated considerable wealth, investing in newly created factories and ships. The United States entered the war later than other countries. Before 1944, it did not commit any large forces to combat. The fact that U.S. territory suffered no losses during the war is also of great importance.

Due to the impact of the war on the United States and Canada, which is completely different from the impact of the war on European and Far Eastern capitalist countries, the current situation is just like the period after World War I. Capitalism is not experiencing a uniform economic situation. In the United States, we see a "boom," while in other countries that have fought, economic improvements are very slow, and production continues to be at the low levels characteristic of panic periods.

However, even the "boom" in the United States is not normal. Despite the "boom," there are still 2.5 million unemployed workers, and 1.5 million demobilized soldiers still rely on government subsidies to live. This year's industrial production is more than one-third lower than in 1943. Due to soaring prices, the real wages of workers are decreasing day by day. The abolition of all price controls will inevitably lead to a further surge in prices and cause a relative reduction in the purchasing power of workers, office workers, and government employees, who constitute the majority of consumers. This will accelerate the end of the current "boom" and accelerate the arrival of a new economic panic.

Three facts indicate that such a panic is approaching in the United States: First, commodity inventories are increasing. According to statistics from the Department of Commerce, the value of commodity inventories in industry and wholesale and retail sectors has increased by $10 billion. The Department of Commerce stated that such an increase in inventories "is undoubtedly full of threats to future economic development."

Second, spot exchange prices of raw materials fell significantly in October. The raw material price index showed an unprecedented plunge in a week since 1933.

Third, industrial stock prices fell rapidly from mid-May to mid-September this year. The total value of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange has fallen from $84 billion to $65 billion. Experience tells us that such a sharp drop in prices often begins about 12 to 18 months before the arrival of an economic panic, because the well-informed tycoons of financial oligarchy begin to dump industrial stocks.

All of this proves that it is expected that the United States will experience an economic panic in the near future, probably no later than 1948, perhaps even earlier.

This economic panic will arrive with extremely profound and widespread consequences. Not only will the U.S. economy suffer a serious blow, but also the post-war reconstruction work heavily burdened by various capitalist countries in the world that have been destroyed by the war will suffer a significant blow. The devastating impact of the panic will probably not allow these countries to achieve economic prosperity.

　　经济学权威瓦尔加著文称
    美国正逼近经济恐慌
    目前的“兴隆”局面将会很快完结
    【新华社延安十七日电】十一月二十七日，苏联科学院研究员瓦尔加在“真理报”著文说：
    当美国从来不曾经历过的事，或许是最大的“兴隆”正盛的时候，对于新的经济恐慌正在逼迫的畏惧，在资本主义世界中迅速地增长着。
    这种畏惧，是完全有理由。曾在战争中作战过的一切资本主义国家，除了美国和加拿大从战争中获得利润外，都比在战前贫穷得多了。英国已丧失了在国内和国外的国民财富的约百分之二十五，德国已丧失了他的约二分之一的财富。在欧洲各国中，生产量只相当于战前水准的百分之十到百分之八十。这种百分数的高低，视战争破坏的程度而定，因此生产量比最严重的恐慌期间更少得多。
    美国和被蹂躏过的欧洲大陆适成对照，她从战争中脱颖而出时，财富增加了。
    一九四六年，美国的工业生产比一九三八年超过百分之五十，因此已达到“兴隆”的水准。战时美国生产，比一九三九年增加一倍以上。生产方面这样的增加，使美国不仅能够适应战争的要求，而且也够满足民众的需要。另外，美国还蓄积了颇大的财富，投资在新创的工厂与船舶方面。美国进入战争比别的国家迟些，在一九四四年以前，她没有把任何大的兵力投入战斗。美国领土在战争期间，没有受到任何损失，这一事实也是具有极大重要性的。
    由于战争对美国及加拿大的影响，跟战争对欧洲及远东各资本主义国家的影响，是完全两样的。现在就正像第一次世界大战后的时期，资本主义不是经历着整齐划一的经济情况。在美国看到“兴隆”，而在曾经打过仗的别的国家中，经济情况的改善却十分缓慢，生产继续处于恐慌时期所特有的低度水准上。
    但是，就连美国的“兴隆”也不是正常的，美国尽管“兴隆”，还有二百五十万失业工人，和一百五十万复员士兵依然依靠政府给他们的津贴费生活。而今年工业生产，比一九四三年减少三分之一以上。由于物价飞涨，工人的实际工资日益减少，取消一切物价的管制，势必引起物价更进一步的飞涨，并且引起形成消费者大多数的工人、职员和政府公务员购买力的相对的减少，这就要加速目前“兴隆”局面的完结，并加速新经济恐慌的到来。
    三件事实指示出，在美国这种恐慌正在逼近：第一、商品的存货正在增加着。据商务部统计资料，工业方面以及批发和零售商方面的商品存货的价值，已增加十亿美元，商业部声明存货这样增加，“对于今后经济的发展，充满了确实无疑的威胁”。
    第二、原料的现货交换价格，十月份减低了许多。原料价格指数，在一周内表现着自一九三三年以来空前的惨跌。
    第三、工业股票的行情，在今年五月半到九月半的期间迅速低落，纽约证券交易所登记的股票总值，已从八百四十亿跌落到六百五十亿美元。经验告诉我们，行情的这样的暴跌，往往开始于经济恐慌到来之前约十二个月到十八个月的时候，因为金融寡头政治的消息灵通的大享们，开始抛出工业股票了。
    所有这一切证明，预料美国在最近的将来，大概不会迟于一九四八年，也许还要早些，就会发生经济恐慌。
    这种经济恐慌将以极深刻的广泛的姿态到来，不仅美国经济将遭受严重的打击，且使曾经被战争破坏的世界各资本主义国家所沉重负担的战后复兴工作，受到一种显著的打击，恐慌造成的破坏性的影响，大概不会容许这些国家达成经济的繁荣的。
