How to Learn in a Decentralized Work Environment?
Reader Consultant
Consult for the readers, please consult the readers; everyone has questions, please ask them, if you don't understand, ask everyone again.

Please ask those with learning experience to offer their experience as consultants

Question:
Dear Editor:

I am a district cadre and I am very willing to study and improve myself, but because the work environment is too decentralized and I often have to go to the countryside, I cannot participate in collective study in the commune. I am very distressed. I was very happy to see that your newspaper has a "Reader Consultant" section the other day. I think you will definitely be able to tell me how to learn in a decentralized work environment.

Sincerely! Reader Wang Fengzhu

Answer: Comrade Fengzhu:

The problem of how to learn in a decentralized work environment is probably not just yours. Many cadres in the same situation as you may encounter it. We don't know much about how to learn in a decentralized work environment, and we can't give you a very satisfactory answer. We can only offer some past experiences:

First of all, the leadership must pay attention to this issue universally and adopt a unified leadership and decentralized learning approach. For example, a district commune should establish a learning committee jointly by the Party, government, people's organizations to be responsible for leading the learning work: before you are decentralized to the countryside, you should assign certain learning tasks (such as studying a certain document in current political affairs learning, or learning a certain job in business, etc.). Regularly check the learning situation of each cadre who goes to the countryside, understand and solve their learning difficulties. At a certain time, such as when a central task is completed and you return to the district to report and summarize the work, you should also squeeze time to organize cadres to study collectively and conduct learning summaries.

For yourself, it is best to make a personal study plan at the beginning of going to the countryside, based on your situation. When you arrive at the place where you are working—the base village or natural village—in addition to your work, you can study in conjunction with the local village cadres. For example, in current affairs learning, you can organize everyone to read the newspaper together and raise questions about current affairs in the newspaper for discussion. This will not only allow you to learn, but also organize the village cadres to learn, so that they can truly understand the current situation from the discussion, which is much better than a generalized political situation report. If there are problems in the discussion that everyone can't figure out, you can write them down and raise them when you return to the district to report your work. The district cadres can then discuss them collectively to find a conclusion. This can promote and enrich the district's learning and content, and allow the higher authorities to understand the ideological situation of ordinary cadres and the masses, which is of great benefit to the work. As for cultural learning, if your cultural level is low, you can find a teacher from the joint primary school or village primary school where you work to be your teacher, and often ask him to teach you to recognize characters, write letters, or explain books and newspapers that you don't understand. If you have a secondary education, you can study on your own, bring one or two books you like to read at a time, read them often, and practice writing diaries, articles, work reports, and submitting articles to newspapers. Over time, your cultural level can be improved. As for business learning, you should learn from the masses and village cadres at any time in your work, and constantly summarize the successful experiences and lessons of failure. After returning to the district, exchange experiences with other district cadres to continuously familiarize yourself with the business and improve your work ability.

What to learn in each period can be carried out according to the needs of the work. For example, when learning current affairs, you can investigate what confused ideas village cadres and the masses have about current affairs, and consider it as achieving the purpose of learning current affairs if you clarify them with the village cadres. The same is true for business learning. If you are engaged in mass movement, and the issue of the mass line is raised, you must explore from your work what the mass line is, and summarize your work experience in order to mobilize the masses well. In short, you must learn purposefully and not blindly.

In a decentralized work environment, regularization and regularity of learning are very difficult to maintain compared with the normal learning of the organization. This requires you to rely on your own learning enthusiasm and perseverance to persist in it. First, you must be good at squeezing time out of decentralized and fragmented work. Second, you must have perseverance and overcome difficulties resolutely. Don't give up easily. Don't just study enthusiastically for a while and then stop. In a decentralized environment, self-study is the main thing. On the basis of self-study (self-study, personal learning), collective learning is then carried out (collective discussions in the district at certain periods, etc.), so that self-study and collective learning can be well combined.

Learning in a decentralized work environment is a common and important issue. Our general cadres may have the idea that there is no need to study when working in the countryside in a decentralized manner, which is wrong. We must know that learning is especially important in a decentralized work environment. If you don't study hard, your progress will definitely be slow, and you will feel that many difficulties in your work cannot be overcome. For example, if you are engaged in mass work, if you do not study, you will not be able to clarify the mass work policy, and of course you will not be able to do your work well. Therefore, we hope that the leadership in all districts and regions will pay great attention to this issue and often lead and help cadres who are decentralized to the countryside to study. As mentioned above, we do not have much specific experience in this area, and we hope that comrades with experience in learning in a decentralized work environment will write down their learning experiences. We are happy to publish them in the newspaper in order to answer you and other comrades in the same situation more fully.

This concludes, and we hope you will often inform us of your learning situation and experience. Wish you progress! ——Editor

    怎样在分散工作环境中学习？
    读者顾问
    为读者作顾问，请读者作顾问；大家有问尽管问，不懂再向大家问。
    转请学有心得者提出经验作顾问
    问：
    编辑同志：
    我是一个区干部，自己很愿学习求进步，但由于工作环境太分散，经常要下乡，不能在公所里集体学习，苦闷得很，前天看到贵报有了“读者顾问”，非常高兴，我想你们一定能够告诉我怎样在分散工作环境中进行学习的方法。
    敬礼！              读者王凤翥启
    答：凤翥同志：
    在分散工作环境中如何学习这个问题，恐怕不只是你一人有，和你处于同样环境的许多干部同志，可能都要遇到的。在分散工作环境中进行学习的方法，我们知道的不很多，不能很圆满的答复你，只能提供一点过去的经验：
    首先是要领导上普遍注意起这个问题来，采取统一领导分散学习的办法。如一个区公所，就应党政民团体统一成立一个学习委员会，负责进行领导学习的工作：在你们分散下乡之前，就要布置一定的学习任务（如在时事政治学习上，要研讨某一文件，或在业务上学会某一工作等）。经常检查每个下乡干部的学习情况，了解与解决其学习困难。到一定时间，如完成了一个中心工作回区汇报总结工作时，亦应抽挤时间组织干部集体学习，并进行学习总结。
    在你自己，最好在下乡之初，根据你的情况订出个人学习计划，到了你进行工作的地点——基点村或自然村——除了工作外，就可结合当地的村干部进行学习。如时事学习，你可以组织大家一块读报，就报纸上的时事提出问题来拉谈，这样不仅你自己学习了，同时也组织了村干部的学习，使他们真正能从讨论中认清时局，比一般化的政治形势报告强得多。假如讨论中有问题大家都闹不通，可记下来，待你回区上汇报工作时提出，区干部再集体讨论以求得结论，这样既可推动与充实区上的学习与内容，又可使上级了解一般干部群众的思想情况，对工作是有很大好处的。再如文化学习，如果你的文化程度较低，可找工作所在的联合小学或村小学的教员当教师，经常请他教你识字、写信或讲解看不懂的书报。你如有了中等文化程度，就可自修，一次带上一两本喜欢看的书，经常看看，并可练习写日记、作文章、写工作汇报、给报纸投稿等，日子久了，文化程度就可以提高了。至于业务学习，那是应当在工作中随时向群众、村干部学习的，随时总结工作成功的经验和失败的教训，回到区上后，和其他区干部交换经验，不断熟习业务与提高工作能力。
    每一个时期学些什么，可以根据工作中的需要去进行。如学时事，你可调查村干部和群众中对时事有那些糊涂观念，提出和村干部弄清了就算是达到了学时事的目的。学业务亦然，你如搞群众运动，提出群众路线的问题，你就要从工作中摸索什么是群众路线，把工作经验总结起来，以便很好的发动群众。总之，一定要有目的的学，不要盲目的乱学。
    在分散工作环境中，学习的正规化与经常性，和机关的正常学习比起来，是很不容易坚持的，这就要靠你自己的学习热忱与毅力来坚持它。第一必须善于在分散、零碎的工作中挤出时间来，第二要有毅力，遇到困难，要坚韧的克服它，不要一曝十寒，一鼓劲过去就不学了。在分散环境中，主要是自学，在自学（自修、个人学习）的基础上，再进行集体的学习（到一定时期回区上集体讨论等），这样才能使自学与集体学习很好的结合起来。
    在分散工作环境中进行学习，这是一个普遍而重要的问题，我们一般干部，可能存在有分散下乡工作就不必学习的思想，这是不对的。要知道在分散工作环境中学习就特别重要，如不好好学习，自己进步就一定慢，且工作是会感到很多困难无法克服。如你搞群运工作，要是不学习，就不可能明确群运方针，当然就无法作好工作。所以我们希望全区各地领导方面，要很好重视这一个问题，经常领导帮助分散下乡工作的干部学习。上面说过，我们对这方面的具体经验不多，尚望在分散工作环境中学习有经验的同志，把自己学习的心得写出来，我们乐于在报上刊登，以便更圆满地答复你及与你处境相同的其他同志。
    就此结束，望你经常告知学习情况与经验。祝你进步！      ——编者
