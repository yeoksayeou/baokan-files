Xia En Group Movement Experience, Part Three
    Leadership Issues in the Great Movement in the New District
    Dong Ning
        I. Deep into Base Points, Establish Direction.
    Every movement requires leaders to take the lead in creating models to enrich leadership, and at the same time educate cadres and the masses with vivid facts. When En County's Sixth District mobilized the masses, Gaozhuang and Maguantun fired the first shots. When Gaozhuang held struggle sessions to pour out grievances, five or six surrounding villages came to observe, and then the Sanjiao Church rose up, affecting more than twenty surrounding villages. Later, this experience was developed. When creating experience at the base point, cadres and activists from other places were also absorbed into the work at the base point. As a result, these cadres and activists gained methods from the experience at the base point, and the movement quickly developed comprehensively. The result of this approach was not only the smooth guidance of the work, but also the cultivation of a large number of leaders. For example, the election movement in the Sixth District first took the Gaozhuang sub-district as a base point, absorbing one or two cadres and mass leaders from each sub-district. Once everyone had a method, the election movement quickly spread throughout the district, and Gao Fengkui's direction was also established from this. Establishing direction also requires grasping the key points. The masses must have leaders, and an egalitarian leadership style is not good.
            II. Grasp Transformations, Grasp Trends.
    Before a large-scale campaign, there must be base points. During the large-scale campaign, leaders must grasp even tighter, grasp transformations, and grasp trends, otherwise things will still go wrong. We deeply experienced that it is impossible for cadres to comprehend all policies at once. Approval and care cannot be mentioned at the same time. The completion of the overall task must be divided into several specific steps, and principles must be pushed down one by one. For example, after entering the new district and understanding the situation, the biggest problem was "the masses rising up." The leaders grasped this point and, based on the cadres' thinking, put forward "a hundred不怕" ("one hundred not afraid" - a phrase indicating fearlessness). When the great movement started, they promptly emphasized grasping the policy on middle peasants. The First District immediately proposed "not struggling against a single middle peasant," resulting in fewer deviations. The Sixth District proposed it later, resulting in more deviations. Later, they emphasized that "without policy, there will be no final victory of the movement," and then they turned the corner. It is particularly noteworthy that the duration of the great movement must not be too long, otherwise in the later stage of the movement, it will precisely hit the middle peasants. Also, because mass leaders only rely on extremely high enthusiasm after the great movement, they may go in the wrong direction. For example, the haircutting in the Gaozhuang sub-district did not initially grasp the principle of voluntariness, and as a result, some village cadres issued compulsory orders. This phenomenon became widespread throughout the district within a few days. Leaders who cannot grasp trends can only be the tail of the masses, causing losses to the work. The basic problem of grasping transformations and grasping trends is the foresight of the leaders. Without foresight, there is no leadership. For this reason, in addition to creating experience at the base point in a timely manner, leaders must also identify new trends from complex phenomena. This requires finding new experiences from good and bad typical events outside the base point.
            III. Concentrate Mass Opinion, Insist on Leadership.
    Facts have proven that whoever can get close to the masses, whoever is good at concentrating mass opinion, can mobilize the masses. A work style of close contact with the masses should be the beginning of all work. Concentrating mass opinion was a good experience in the consolidation work in the First District. After the great movement, the masses generally brewed the fact that the landlords would counterattack, and proposed how to "prevent the landlord's counterattack" and "seize the landlord's knife." The masses proposed the method of the "removal of traitor hats" movement. At the meeting to remove traitor hats in Dazhuang, not only peasant women, but even many men, women, and children used their rights to put forward specific facts such as "he led the mule" and "he came when our village was attacked" as reasons for disagreeing with him "taking it off," and they were as responsible as if they were their own business. However, because the thinking of a few individuals is to some extent distant from the organizational resolutions, and sometimes the thinking of the peasants may be somewhat distant from the thinking of the leaders, without the unity under centralized guidance, democracy will not be guaranteed. For example, in dealing with some traitors and landlords who can be leniently treated, if a small number of people's thinking is not clear, they must be educated and persevere with all effective methods. This is not paternalism, but a necessary measure.
            IV. Adhere to Principles, Promote Creation.
    The experience of several months has proven that the clearer the principles, the more creations there are. For example, from beginning to end, we insisted on uniting more than 90% of the masses. The Sixth District created the example of distributing fruits equally inside and outside the meeting very early on. The Eighth District's membership development was not widespread enough during the great movement, so it specifically carried out large-scale development. For this reason, leaders must adhere to ideological education. I remember that in mid-August, the most difficult thing to change was the issue of struggling against middle peasants who had committed crimes. Although the leadership had raised it very early on, emphasizing uniting with middle peasants and not generally struggling against middle peasants, some cadres initially resisted, saying that "the masses' thinking is not clear." After ideological review and education on the lessons of struggling against middle peasants in Muwangzhuang, they turned the corner, but even in the process of transformation, the interests of individual middle peasants were still damaged. In short, without leadership, policies cannot be implemented; similarly, without policies, there will be no complete victory in mobilizing the masses. In the past few months, we have generally achieved the elimination of illegal landlord and feudal rule. In addition, it is particularly noteworthy that in some villages in various districts, the interests of middle peasants have been excessively harmed, and this has not been completely corrected. Compensation for the middle peasants who were struggled against should be implemented in the current general inspection movement, and this part of the masses should be united.

　　夏恩群运经验之三
    新区大动中的领导问题
    东宁
        一、深入基点，树立方向。
    每一个运动必须领导者带头创出范例，以丰富领导，同时以活的事实教育干部和群众。恩县六区发动群众，首先是高庄、马官屯响了第一炮，高庄斗争诉苦时，周围五六个村子来参观，接着三教堂起来，周围二十多村受了影响。以后又发展了这一经验，在基点创造经验时，将其他地方的干部和积极分子也都吸收到基点工作，结果这些干部和积极分子从基点体验中有了办法，运动就很快发展到全面。这样作的结果，不只顺利指导了工作，还培养了大批领袖。如六区的选举运动，首先以高庄小区为基点，吸收了每个小区一二个干部和群众领袖，大家有了办法，就很快展开全区的选举运动，高凤魁的方向，也从中树立起来。树立方向，还必须掌握重点，群众必须有领袖，平均主义的领导作风是不好的。
            二、掌握转变、掌握动向。
    大搞之前，要有基点，大搞中领导者还必须抓得更紧，掌握转变，掌握动向，不然一样会出乱子。我们深刻体验到，全部政策不可能一下为干部所领会，批准与照顾不能并提，总任务的完成，必分为若干具体步骤，原则必须一件件往下推。比如进入新区，经过了解情况后，最大问题是“群众起来”，领导者掌握了这点，根据干部思想，提出了“一百个不怕”；在大动起来时，又及时强调了掌握中农政策。一区紧接着大动就提出“不斗一个中农”，结果偏差较少。六区提的较晚，偏差较多，以后又强调了“没有政策，就没有运动的最后胜利”，才转过弯来。特别值得注意的是大动时间，万不能拖得太长，不然犬动后期，就恰恰打到中农身上；又因群众领袖在大动之后，只凭极高的热情办事，说不定出什么偏向。如高庄小区的剪发，开始未掌握自愿原则，影响所及，发生一些村干部的强迫命令，这种现象几天内就普遍全区。不会掌握动向的领导，就只能做群众的尾巴，使工作受到损失。掌握转变，掌握动向的基本问题，是领导者的预见，没有预见就没有领导，为此领导者除及时的在基点创造经验之外，还必须从复杂的现象中，识别新的动态，这就须从基点之外的好的坏的典型事件中找出新经验。
            三、集中群众意见，坚持领导。
    事实证明了，谁能接近群众，谁就善于集中群众意见，便能把群众发动起来，密切联系群众的作风，应是一切工作的开始。一区巩固工作中，集中群众意见是个好经验。大动之后，群众普遍酝酿地主反攻的事实，即提出如何设法“防备地主反攻”和“夺过地主的刀来”。群众提出了摘汉奸帽运动的办法。大庄摘汉奸帽会上，不只农民妇女，连很多男女儿童，都运用自己的权利，提出“骡子是他牵的”，“打咱村时他来了”等具体事实，作为不同意他“摘下来”的理由，把事看成自己事那样负责。但由于个别人的思想，与组织决议有某种程度的距离，有时农民思想可能与领导思想有某些距离，没有集中指导下的统一，同样会使民主无所保证，比如在处理一些可以宽大的汉奸地主，少数人思想不通，就必须经过教育，用一切有效办法坚持下去，这不是包办，而是必要的措施。
            四、坚持原则，发扬创造。
    几个月的经验证明，原则愈明确，创造愈多。比如自始至终，我们即坚持团结百分之九十以上的群众，六区很早就创造了会内会外一样分果实的例子。八区在大动中，会员的发展不够普遍，又专门进行了大发展。为此领导者必须坚持思想教育。记得八月中，最难转变的是斗有罪恶的中农问题，虽然领导上很早提出来，强调团结中农，不能一般的斗争中农，但开始有的干部说：“群众思想不通”来抵抗，经过思想检查，并进行了牟王庄斗中农教训的教育之后，才转过弯来，转变中依然还是损害了个别中农利益。总之，没有领导，就不能实现政策；同样没有政策，就没有发动群众的全部胜利。几个月中，我们一般达到了消灭非法地主封建统治。另外特别值得注意的，各区有些村子损害中农利益过重的，尚未完全纠正，应在目前大检查运动中贯彻对被斗中农的补偿，将这部分群众团结起来。（新华社冀南分社）
