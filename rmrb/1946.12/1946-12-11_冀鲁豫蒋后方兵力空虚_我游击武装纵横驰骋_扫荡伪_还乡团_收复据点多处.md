[Our Dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu Front, 7th] The invading army's insufficient strength and extended front lines have created an unprecedentedly favorable opportunity for our guerrilla activities behind enemy lines. On November 15th, our Second Military Sub-district's Yun-Ju Guerrilla Brigade ambushed the enemy on the side of Hongchuankou, killing on the spot Chiang's secret agent leader Zhang Zhilai and six others, and capturing alive Chiang's township head and more than ten others. On the same day, the enemy originally stationed in Yuncheng jointly attacked our Yunbei Guerrilla Force. We immediately maneuvered to the outskirts of the city, and taking the enemy by surprise, burned down four enemy bunkers. On the 16th, our Juye Brigade raided Tianhutun, ten miles north of Juye city. Chiang's Ninth and Tenth District Headquarters and "Homecoming Corps" and other armed forces were completely annihilated, killing and wounding over thirty Chiang puppet district chiefs and others, and capturing ninety-six alive, seizing more than fifty long and short guns. On the 17th, a part of our local military corps captured Yuzhouzhen on the Heze-Dongming line, and a part of Chiang's 181st Brigade was annihilated by us, capturing more than sixty enemies and seizing more than twenty rifles. On the 23rd, a certain guerrilla team of our Seventh Military Sub-district recovered Zhifangzhen, west of Jiaxiang city, capturing eleven Chiang stubborn elements and seizing three rifles. The next day, more than 600 Chiang special reactionary armed personnel attempted to retaliate against us. After an hour of fierce fighting, we suffered no casualties, while the enemy suffered more than forty casualties and fled in panic. On the 26th, a certain guerrilla unit of our Fifth Military Sub-district annihilated more than fifty Chiang local team members between Weiwan and Lvyuanzi, northwest of Caoxian County, with no casualties on our side. On the 30th, a certain unit of our guerrilla force raided the West Gate of Chengwu, and both of Chiang's district public offices were completely resolved by us. On the same day, a certain guerrilla corps of ours ambushed the Hu Family Shop (south of Zhangfengji) in Juye, completely annihilating a part of the puppet Zhang Lanfeng's unit, killing and wounding 250 enemies, and seizing six light and heavy machine guns, one mortar, and more than fifty rifles. According to preliminary statistics, from the 15th of last month to the 1st of this month, in half a month, the Ji-Lu-Yu rear area guerrilla militia fought the enemy forty-one times, destroyed two Chiang district public offices, six township public offices, recovered four important Chiang strongholds, killed and wounded five hundred and fifty-four enemy puppets, captured nine hundred and twenty-seven alive, and seized sixteen light and heavy machine guns, seven hundred and fifty-two long and short guns, two American-style automatic rifles, and eleven mortars, small cannons, and grenade launchers.
