(From our correspondent in Changzhi)
　　In Taiyuan city, under the rule of the puppet Yan regime, prices have skyrocketed since the beginning of winter. Not only are the lives of ordinary citizens miserable, but even minor clerks employed by the puppet Yan authorities are constantly complaining. According to an article titled "Prices Gallop Like Wild Horses, Small Civil Servants Suffer, Family of Three Weeps Together," published on page three of the Taiyuan Minzhong Daily on November 25th: "Since being laid off after the reorganization of the military, I have been borrowing from east to west, seeking rice and searching for flour, barely surviving for two months. Finally, through a friend's introduction, I took a position as a minor clerk in a certain government office. At the beginning of my tenure, my monthly salary was more than 60,000 yuan, and each bag of flour cost around 20,000 yuan, which was just enough for my family of three to get by." "Recently, each bag of flour costs more than 40,000 yuan, more than double the previous price. A salary of more than 60,000 yuan is only enough to buy one and a half bags of flour." "Moreover, the weather is freezing cold, and we have no cotton clothes or coal. My family of three will soon freeze and starve to death. Every time I think of this, I want to drown myself." "The other day, my wife cried and said to me, "Let's go home! Even begging from door to door at home is better than staying in Taiyuan." Speaking of this, the whole family of three couldn't help but cry together." "Our superiors in the office always postpone adjusting our salaries, saying it will be issued tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. Seeing that November is over, there is still no news. What kind of medicine the high-ranking officials are taking, I dare not say." From this, it can be seen that even low-level civil servants in Taiyuan under Yan Xishan's rule are in such a state. How difficult must the lives of ordinary citizens be? The fact that high-ranking officials exploit low-ranking officials, withholding salaries, and the internal corruption further demonstrates that the reactionary rulers are bound to die quickly.

　　太原物价高涨公务员将饿毙
    【本报长治讯】阎伪统治下的太原城，入冬以来，物价飞涨，不仅市民生活困苦，即供职于阎伪机关之小职员，亦无不叫苦连天。据十一月二十五日太原民众日报第三版刊载，题为“物价野马驰奔，苦了小公务员，一家三口抱头痛哭”一文内称：“我自从整军被裁后，每日东借西贷，寻米找面，苟延残喘，维持了两月，始由友人介绍××机关担任小职员。任职之初，月支薪饷六万余元，白面每袋二万元上下，一家三口尚能对付糊口。”“迩来白面每袋四万余元，较前超过一倍有余，六万余元之薪饷，仅买白面袋余”。“更加天寒地冻，棉衣煤炭无着，举家三口眼见即要冻饿而死，每念及此，即欲投水自尽”。“日前内人曾哭着向我说：“咱归家吧！归家即沿门乞食也比太原强的多，”言及此，举家三口不禁相对大哭”。“我们机关的主官，对于调整待遇，总是今日不发推明日，明日不发推后日，眼见十一月份已完了，还是杳无信息，官大爵高的老爷们，瓶里装的什么药，我更不敢明言。”从此可以看出阎锡山统治下的太原下级公务员尚且如此，市民生活又当如何困难。其大官吃小官，扣薪不发，内部之腐臭情况，更说明反动统治者必然迅速死亡。
