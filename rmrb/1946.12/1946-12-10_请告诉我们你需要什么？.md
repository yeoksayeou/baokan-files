　　Please tell us what you need?
    We also have a few questions, please help us answer them:
    1. Of the one or two dozen issues of the supplement that have already been published, which articles do you like to read, and which do you dislike?
    2. What kind of articles do you think should be added, and what new columns should be opened?
    3. Which do you need more: articles that are practically helpful or articles that you find interesting?
    4. Do you think the language we use is too deep or too shallow?
    5. Do you think the layout of the supplement is clear? How should it be changed?
    6. Apart from "Reader's Advisor," what other services do you want us to provide to satisfy you?
    Please write to us quickly so that we can make corrections by the beginning of next year. Please also indicate your age, gender, job position, and education level in your letter for our reference when compiling the results. We eagerly look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely!

第3版()
专栏：

　　请告诉我们你需要什么？
    我们也有几个问题，请诸位帮忙答复一下：
    一、副刊已出的一、二十期中，你爱读那些文章，不爱读那些文章？
    二、你觉得还应增添什么种类的文章，辟什么新栏？
    三、对你有切实帮助和使你感到有趣的文章，两者中那一种你更需要？
    四、我们所用的语文，你觉得太深还是太浅？
    五、对副刊的版面，你觉得清楚么，应如何改变
    六、除“读者顾问”等外，你更有什么事情要我们服务？才使你满意？
    请迅速写信给我们，以便明年初就可改正。信中并请说明你的年龄、姓别、工作岗位、文化程度，作我们集纳时的参考。我们热切地盼望着。敬礼！
