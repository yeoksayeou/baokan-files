　　Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek
  　Selected Poems from the Streets of Yan'an, Part 3
    Ge Bizhou
    Wang Jingwei, a lapdog,
    Following the devils every step of the way,
    Wagging his tail, nodding his head,
    When the devils' platform collapses, he'll be done for too!
    Chiang Kai-shek, a sneaky biting dog,
    Led around by his American master,
    Drinking human blood, eating human flesh,
    I reckon you'll be like a mosquito in September when the time comes!

　　汪精卫和蒋介石
  　延安街头诗选之三
    戈壁舟
    汪精卫，哈巴狗，
    步步跟着鬼子走，
    摇摇尾，摆摆头，
    鬼子台垮他也球！
    蒋介石，偷咬狗，
    美国老爷牵着走，
    喝人血，吃人肉，
    我看你九月的蚊子到时候！
