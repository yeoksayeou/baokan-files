Xinhua News Agency, Central China, November 11th: In the Yeting City (Yancheng) front, the New Fourth Army, from the 26th of last month to the morning of the 9th of this month (approximately half a month), has killed or wounded more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops, captured more than 2,000 alive, and sunk more than ten armored motorboats. The 83rd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which launched a frontal attack on Yeting City, suffered the heaviest casualties and was utterly defeated. The remnants of this division and the 65th Division have retreated to Xicaoyan, Baiju, Liuzhuang and other places north of Dongtai. After recovering towns such as Biancang south of Yancheng, the New Fourth Army is pursuing the victory. The 108th Brigade of the 25th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which invaded from the west, had more than ten armored motorboats it carried sunk by the New Fourth Army, and forcibly commandeered hundreds of civilian boats to flee back to Xinghua. The New Fourth Army has recovered Qin Juncang and other places more than 20 kilometers southwest of Yancheng. The 67th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which originally planned to participate in the frontal invasion, upon hearing of the great defeat at the front, also retreated in panic to Dongtai.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, November 11th: A part of the 52nd Brigade of the 28th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which occupied Qingong Town and other places east of Lianghuai, under the cover of two American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft on the 7th and 8th, launched attacks on Jiajiazhuang in the northeast and Shunheji in the southeast, respectively, but were repelled by the New Fourth Army, with a total of more than 400 casualties. On the morning of the 9th, they attacked Shunheji again, and in the afternoon, they attacked Henggou Temple to the north, but both failed.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, November 8th: The Bao'ying local armed forces achieved two victories in one month. On the 30th of last month, they repelled the Chiang Kai-shek army's 40th Brigade of the 25th Division, which invaded the area south of Caodian from Wangzhigang in the east of Bao'ying, and two battles in which Chiang Kai-shek troops fled from Wangzhigang to Lucun and other areas in the southeast, killing and capturing a total of 52 Chiang Kai-shek troops, seizing more than 20 rifles and machine guns, and more than 30 grain boats. On the 12th of the same month, the Xinghua local armed forces sank four Chiang Kai-shek vessels and killed 70 of their personnel near Xiejiazhuang in eastern Xinghua.
