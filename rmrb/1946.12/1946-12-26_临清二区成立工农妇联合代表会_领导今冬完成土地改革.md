【This newspaper, Weixian, 22nd dispatch】 Linqing strives to complete land reform this winter. On November 30th, the Second District of Linqing convened a forum with over 200 cadres and activists from the entire district to conduct an in-depth review of the past emancipation movement. In the 63 villages of the district, ten villages, including Shiliwu, Wulimiao, and Xingyuan, had not mobilized the masses and had not overthrown feudal rule, with a total of 15 stubborn landlords. Twenty-seven villages, including Fang Village Field, Hou Fan Township, and Zao Village, had insufficient mass mobilization and had not thoroughly eliminated feudal forces, with 52 landlords remaining. Among them, 16 villages, including Zaolin, Fan Township, and Li Tang, had fruit case issues pending resolution. Eleven villages, including Dong Maliu, were experiencing sectarian disputes. Twenty-one villages, including Nanguan, Tuqiao, and Jia Village, had unresolved problems of poor villagers. In total, the land issues of the extremely poor in 58 villages had largely not been resolved. Therefore, it was determined that the Second District should continue to conduct anti-traitor liquidation and anti-despot struggles, thoroughly eliminate feudal rule and feudal exploitation, completely resolve the land issues of the extremely poor, realize "land to the tiller," and combine the clearing of fruit to resolve pending cases, consolidate and expand the organization. After intense debate during the meeting, it was decided not to struggle against middle peasants, but to unite with them and jointly oppose feudalism. Finally, at the activist conference, Shi Bingjun, Rong Zhenhe, Li Sisao, Zhao Yuzhi, and 11 others were elected as representatives to establish a temporary joint representative assembly of district workers, peasants, and women, leading 20,000 people in the district to carry out the investigation and rent reduction movement.

　　临清二区成立工农妇联合代表会
    领导今冬完成土地改革
    【本报威县二十二日电】临清争取今冬完成土地改革。临清二区于十一月三十日召开全区二百余人的干部积极分子座谈会，对过去翻身运动作了深入的检查。在全区六十三村中，群众未发动，封建统治未打垮者有十里屋、五里庙、杏园等十个村，共有封顽地主十五家。群众发动不充分，封建势力消灭不彻底者有房村场、后范町、枣村等二十七个村，尚有地主五十二家，其中枣林、范町、李堂等十六个村，有果实悬案。东马榴等十一村闹宗派纠纷。小穷村问题未解决者有南关、土桥、贾庄等二十一村。总计共五十八个村的赤贫土地问题大部未得到解决。因此确定二区今后应继续进行反奸清算，反恶霸斗争，彻底消灭封建统治与封建剥削，全部解决赤贫土地问题，实现“耕者有其田”，并结合清理果实解决悬案，巩固与扩大组织。会议中经过激烈的辩论，决定不斗中农，并团结中农，一致反封建。最后在积极分子大会上，选举了施炳均、荣振和、李四嫂、赵玉之等十五人为代表，成立区工、农、妇，临时联合代表会，领导全区二万群众进行查减运动。
