[Reported from Weixian on the 2nd] The Seventh District of Yuan Dynasty has victoriously completed land reform. During the movement, the district and village Farmers' Representative Congresses became genuine leading organs, leading the farmers' struggle. All departments acted in a unified manner under the leadership of the Farmers' Representative Congress. For example, if the village chief and the director of the Armed Forces Committee are village representatives, they participate in the representative meetings; if they are members, they are assigned to groups to play a key role. County and district cadres, in order to establish the prestige of the Farmers' Representative Congress, do not appear as county and district leading cadres, but act as advisors to the representative congress and as members of the masses. During the movement, they seized the opportunity to develop mass organizations, the militia, and Party members at several key junctures: in the period of brewing struggle, they fully developed mass organizations, absorbed a large number of middle peasants and activists who emerged after the winter movement, and strengthened the lineup for struggle; in the tense atmosphere of victory after striking at the arrogance of stubborn feudal landlords, they grasped the masses' demand to arm themselves and developed the militia on a large scale; when the movement entered the consolidation stage, activists who had been tested were admitted as Party members after certain procedures. During the consolidation stage, in order to rationally distribute the fruits of victory, the district universally carried out the work of dividing class status in each village. There were three ways to divide class status: the first was for village cadres to evaluate who belonged to which class status and then announce it at a general meeting. This easily aroused the masses' resentment towards the village cadres, and the village cadres felt distressed. The second was to find a "standard person" and have them stand on one side, and then the masses would decide where to stand in relation to the "standard person." If someone was not suitable, the masses of other classes would push them out, while the masses of the class they were trying to join would pull them in. Although this was fast, pushing and pulling was very stimulating and affected unity, which deserves attention. The third method was to have group discussions, followed by a review by a joint meeting of group leaders. If someone was not suitable, the group leader would educate them before provisional registration and approval at a general meeting, and the person could still raise their own opinion. This method was better. During the distribution of fruits, appropriate care was given to military dependents, cadre dependents, and honored veterans. Military dependents received one more share than their class status warranted and had priority in the distribution of fruits. Honored veterans were treated on a household basis. For example, Yang Chunshan, a demobilized soldier from Zhangluji, received a portion of housing in Zhangluji during this distribution of fruits. However, because there were too few fruits in that village, he went to Beixiaozhang Village to receive another portion of fruits. When land was distributed to the old, weak, orphaned, and widowed, good land was given. For example, one family in Beixiaozhang Village was only a single person and was treated as three extremely poor people. Those who were forced to flee due to famine were also given land according to the principle of "filling in the gaps" so that they would have land to cultivate and food to eat when they returned home in the future; however, those who had been gone for too long without any news were not compensated.

　　元朝七区抓紧运动环节
    发展农会民兵党员
  　斗争中农代会统一领导各组织行动
  　为使果实分配合理民主方式划分阶层
    【本报威县二日电】元朝七区胜利完成土地改革，运动中区村农代会成为名符其实的领导机关，领导农民斗争，各部门都在农代会的领导下，统一行动。如村长和武委会主任是村代表的则参加代表会，是会员的则划入小组起骨干作用。县区干部为了树立农代会的威信，都不以县区领导干部出现，而给代表会作参谋，作为群众的一员。运动中抓紧了发展群众组织，发展民兵，发展党的几个时机：在酝酿斗争时期，充分的发展了群众组织，大量的吸收了中农和去冬运动以后产生的积极分子参加农会，壮大了斗争的阵容；在打击封建顽固地主的凶焰以后的紧张胜利空气中，掌握了群众武装自己的要求，大量发展了民兵；运动进入巩固阶段，积极分子都经过了考验则经过一定手续吸收党员。在巩固阶段中，该区为了合理分配果实，各村普遍进行了划分阶层的工作。划分的办法有三种：第一种是村干部评议谁是什么成份，然后大会公布，这很容易引起群众对村干的反感，村干感觉苦恼。第二种是找出标准人站在一旁，群众自己看着标准人站，如有不合适的，别阶层群众向外推，本阶层向里拉，如下中农跑到贫农阶层，贫农往外推中农往里拉。这样虽快，但一推一拉很刺激人，影响团结，值得注意。第三种是经过小组讨论，再经小组长联席会审查，不合适的，经小组长向其本人进行教育后，暂行登记等大会通过，最后自己还可提出意见，这样方式比较好。分果实中对军属、干属、荣誉军人等进行了适当照顾。军属比本阶层多分一份，并且在分果实中有优先权。对荣誉军人进行了按家，如张鲁集退伍军人杨春山，在这次分果实中，在张鲁集分了一部分屋宅，但因那村果实太少，又到北小丈村分了一部分果实。对老弱孤寡分地时给了好地，如北小丈一家只孤身一人，是按三个赤贫分的。对灾荒年被生活所迫逃荒出外的，也是按照填平补齐的原则，补给他们，以便今后回家时有地种有饭吃；但年月过久无音信者就不补了。
