    (From our newspaper in Wu'an) Serious waste has been discovered in some areas of Wu'an, and this should be corrected quickly. In the Dongguan area of the city, the family of three of ××× eats meat three meals a day and have almost eaten through the fruits of their struggle in just one month, but the weather is already very cold and they still haven't put on cotton clothes. Militiamen from the Second District are receiving training in the city. In addition to the food provided by the county, each person reports more than 3,000 yuan in expenses when returning home within ten days. One militiaman from a certain village spent 5,000 yuan on a single restaurant meal. When village cadres from the Tenth District hold meetings, they don't eat millet but ask the villages to send rice, white flour, and pork. This kind of waste has attracted the attention of the county's leadership organs, and they are calling on all cadres and the masses to plan for the long term, recognize the long-term nature of the war, practice strict economy, stop waste, and support the war.

    浪费果实严重
    领导上号召节约生产
    【本报武安讯】武安部分地区发现严重的浪费现象，应该很快纠正。城内东关×××一家三人，每日三顿肉，一月来已快将斗争果实吃光，天已很冷，棉衣还未穿上。二区民兵在城内受训，县里供给伙食外，十天内每人回去都报三千元以上的开支。某村民兵下一次饭馆花五千元。十区村干部开会，不吃小米，叫村中送大米、白面、猪肉。此种浪费现象，已引起该县领导机关注意，并号召全体干部群众一切从长期打算，认识战争之长期性，厉行节约，制止浪费，支持战争。
