Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 14th: According to a Changshu dispatch in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily of November 26th, the county government of this county recently, under the slogan of "Nothing is more urgent than military grain," mobilized all the officials and soldiers of the entire organization, including secretaries, section chiefs, and directors, to go to various districts by car to collect 20,000 shi of field tax for the 35th year. They carried a secret order from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which stated, "No matter what method is used, achieving the task is the sole objective." When the peasants saw the grain officials coming to the countryside, the elderly shook their heads and wept, and the young people had no choice but to slip away. Many peasants really could not produce half a jin of rice and had to resist the armed grain collection with their lives. Many landlords were also taken to jail by the officers and soldiers. In some places, a policy of dumping rice was implemented. Grain officials led armed squads to guard the back doors of the peasants' houses. Regardless of the situation, they dumped all the rice they found in the peasants' homes. The women pleaded with them, "Thank you, grandpas, leave us enough to eat for one day!" They kicked them and said, "Damn it, this is an order from above, and we can't help it!" Thus, the grain was seized. A young peasant said, "The grain is being collected to fight the Communists. We have no hatred for the Communists. Why are you forcing us to give up our grain to fight them?"

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 14th: According to the Dagong Bao, Hunan is urging the collection of grain with extreme urgency. Chiang Kai-shek and Grain Minister Gu Zhenglun telegraphed the Hunan Provincial Government, ordering them to collect 80% by the end of November and to deliver the full amount by December. In addition to actual grain collection and borrowing, Hunan Province has an endless stream of other grain levies, such as the so-called "He Bao Hospital" grain levy, the prison construction grain levy, and the construction of rural primary school buildings, teacher salaries, and grain storage in Linxiang County, northern Hunan, totaling more than ten kinds. Each county sends teams to supervise the collection, forcing the countryside into chaos, and many people abandon their homes and flee.

    蒋政府勒索军粮急  农民被逼弃家潜逃
    【新华社延安十四日电】据十一月二十六日渝新华日报载常熟通讯称：本县县政府最近在“万事莫如军粮急”的口号下，整个机关的官吏、兵丁包括秘书、科长、主任全体动员，乘车分赴各区征三十五年度二万石的田赋。身上带着江苏省府密令，上面写着“无论用任何方法，总以达到任务为唯一目的”。农民们看见粮官下乡，老年人摇头流泪，年青人只好溜走。许多农民实在拿不出半斤米，只好用生命来抵抗征粮的武装。许多地主也被官兵押到牢里，有些地方实行倒米政策，粮官带着武装大队把农民的后门把守着，不管青红皂白，见着农民家里有米就全部倒去。妇女们向他们要求：“谢谢爷爷，留给我们吃一天吧”！他们用脚一踢：“奶奶的，这是上峰命令，俺也没法”！就这样把粮抢走了。一个青年农民说：“征粮为了打共产党，我们和共产党没有仇恨，为什么逼我们的粮去打呢”？
    【新华社延安十四日电】据大公报载称：湖南催粮，急如星火。蒋介石及粮食部长谷正伦，分别电饬湘省府，限十一月底征足八成，十二月全数交清。湘省征粮除征实征借外，其他派粮名目复层出不穷，如湘北临湘县即有所谓兴修“和保医院”之派谷，兴修监狱之派谷，各乡兴修小学校舍以及教职员薪给与积谷等等共十余种之多。各县派队坐催，迫得农村鸡犬不宁，老百姓多弃家潜逃。
