　　Taihang Second Administrative District Issues Order Prohibiting the Killing of Fetal Lambs and Small Lambs

　　[This newspaper's Changzhi Dispatch] The Taihang Second Administrative Office recently issued a proclamation strictly prohibiting the slaughter of fetal lambs and small lambs. The proclamation stated: "Since the beginning of winter, the phenomenon of slaughtering ewes and lambs has been continuously discovered in various places (especially in towns). For example, a certain store in Shixia Town, Zuoquan, slaughtered a ewe that was still carrying a lamb in its womb. There are even cases of slaughtering fetal lambs and small lambs specifically for the sale of two-lamb pelts and unborn lamb skins. This is extremely harmful to the growth and expansion of sheep flocks and the accumulation of fertilizer for increased production in the liberated areas." It continued: "In order to develop sheep flocks, greatly increase production, ensure military and civilian food supplies, and support the long-term war, the slaughter of fetal lambs and small lambs is strictly prohibited. Anyone who slaughters must first register with the district office for inspection before slaughtering is permitted, and it is hoped that governments at all levels will educate merchants and civilians to consciously abide by this."

　　太行二专署通令不准杀胎羊小羊
    【本报长治讯】太行第二专署顷颁发布告严禁宰杀胎羊和小羊。该布告首称：“入冬以来，各地不断发现宰杀母羊与小羊的现象（特别是城镇），如左权石匣镇×商店，杀了母羊之后肚里还有小羊。甚至还有为了出售二羔与肚剥羔皮，专门宰杀胎羊和小羊。这对解放区羊群滋长壮大和积肥增产危害很大。”继称：“为了发展羊群，大量增产，保证军需民食，支持长期战争起见，严禁宰杀胎羊和小羊。凡杀者事前一律到区公所登记查验后方准宰杀，并希各级政府教育商民自觉遵守。”（申法彰）
