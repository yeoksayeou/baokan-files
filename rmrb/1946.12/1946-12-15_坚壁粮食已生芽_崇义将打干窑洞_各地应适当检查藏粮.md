    [This Newspaper, Wu'an News] In Wu'an's Eighth District, preparations for war and production are being actively carried out. During a war preparedness inspection in Chongyi Village, it was discovered that the grain buried in several cellars had sprouted. The village leadership then called on everyone to dig dry cellars, proposing that "not a single grain of food should be taken by Chiang's army, nor should a single grain be allowed to rot." The village's children's corps has already made fifty-two stone landmines. Old people Sun Yongyi and his wife, both over sixty years old, have made two themselves. The whole village has already made six hundred and twenty-five, and is still actively continuing. Ten villages including Baiguan, Shi'erzhuang, and Wan'an have completed war preparation work and have already moved into winter production. Eighty percent of the women have joined textile organizations, with each woman guaranteeing to spin at least ten catties of cotton per month. The men are rushing to gather firewood, preparing for the relocation of the masses in the new area to burn. Small cooperatives in each village are ginning cotton, batting cotton, and spinning cotton. The sound of looms can be heard everywhere. This winter, the small cooperative in Dongwan'an has already earned over ten thousand yuan in ocean currency (yuan of foreign exchange).

    【本报武安讯】武安八区一面积极备战，一面积极生产。崇义村在备战检查中发现几个窑洞埋的粮食都生了芽，该村领导上乃号召大家打干窑洞，提出“粮食不让蒋军抢走一颗，也不让烂掉一颗。”该村儿童团现已打好石雷五十二个，孙永义老俩口都已六十余岁了，还打了两个，全村已打好六百二十五个，现仍在积极进行中。百官、史二庄、万安等十村备战工作完成，并已转入冬季生产。百分之八十妇女已参加纺织组织，每一个妇女一月最低保证纺十斤花。男人们突击打柴，准备新区群众转移时烧用。各庄小型合作社都在轧花，弹花，纺花，到处可闻机杼之声。东万安小型合作社今冬生产已赚洋万余元。
