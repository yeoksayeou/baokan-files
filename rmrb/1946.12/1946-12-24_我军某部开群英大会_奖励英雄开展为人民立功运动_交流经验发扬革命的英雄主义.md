　　Our Army Holds a Gathering of Heroes
    Rewards Heroes, Launches a Campaign to Perform Meritorious Service for the People
    Exchanges Experiences, and Promotes Revolutionary Heroism
    [Report from the Jilu Yu Frontline Reporter Corps, 20th] This month on the 15th, a certain unit of our army held a gathering of heroes in its stationed area. A Jiang army truck driver, just liberated from the battle of Hua County, drove an American-made "Jemson" ten-wheeled truck and a jeep to welcome the heroes to the meeting. In the afternoon, the highest commander of the unit hosted a banquet for 322 heroes and models. In the evening, a soiree was held. On the 16th, a grand opening ceremony was held. Political Commissar × delivered a speech, saying: The spirit of this conference is to reward heroes and launch a campaign to perform meritorious service; through the leading role of the heroes, we must cultivate more heroes, exchange experiences, promote work, and promote revolutionary heroism. A certain commissioner, on behalf of two million people, paid tribute to the heroes. Hero models then delivered speeches in succession. Zhang Jintang, a hero who killed the enemy, said, "We have fought many beautiful battles, but we must continue to work hard until all of Chiang Kai-shek's troops are driven out of the liberated areas!" Xue Yuxiang, a hero who killed the enemy and was liberated in the battle of Juancheng, said, "I participated for one day and became an old Eighth Route Army soldier. In the attack on Shao Erzhai, I captured a machine gun." Wang Xian, a hero who killed the enemy and was liberated in the battle of Dingtao, said, "Chiang Kai-shek taught me how to use weapons and be cannon fodder in the civil war. Today, I will turn my gun around and fight him, this bastard, and turn my hometown into a liberated area too." On the evening of the 16th, group discussions were held to exchange experiences. All participants passed a letter of condolence to the wounded and sick heroes and the families of martyrs who sacrificed blood for the motherland and the people. The conference closed victoriously on the 17th. Hero models rode on fine horses and returned to their original units in the fading twilight. Before departing, leader × delivered a brief speech, requesting each hero "to combine courage with technique and always maintain the honor given to us by the people." Along the way, the masses lined the streets to welcome them, shouting "Long live the heroes!" (Fang De)
