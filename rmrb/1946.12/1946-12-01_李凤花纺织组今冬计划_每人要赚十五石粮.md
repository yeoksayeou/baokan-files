　　Li Fenghua Textile Group's Winter Plan:
    Each Person to Earn Fifteen *Shi* of Grain

    [This newspaper's Taiyue Electric Dispatch] The Li Fenghua Textile Group of the Zhao Meiying Mutual Aid Team in Fushan's Fan Village plans this winter for each person to earn fifteen *shi* of jade millet, equivalent to the total value of a year's agricultural production, through textile production. The group consists of six elderly women, all over fifty years old. In their youth, they suffered greatly from landlord exploitation. Now that they have turned over, their enthusiasm for production to get rich is very high. Liu Shanben's 62-year-old mother is so anxious that she cannot sleep at night, getting up in the middle of the night to spin until dawn. They plan to start on the sixteenth day of the tenth lunar month, with each person providing one *jin* of cotton as capital, spinning and weaving themselves. It is estimated that it will take thirty workdays to weave nine *zhang* of cloth, worth 5,200 yuan, which can buy back twenty-two *jin* of cotton. After three such cycles, by the second month of the lunar calendar next year, they will be able to weave 169.5 *zhang* of cloth, worth 100,140 yuan, which can buy ninety-two *shi* and one *dou* and eight *sheng* of corn. After deducting the six *jin* of capital cotton, each person will net a profit of fifteen *shi* and one *dou* and three *sheng*. Currently in the second cycle, the warp threads have been set up, and it is estimated that the plan will be completed soon. (Lang Qiao)

　　李凤花纺织组今冬计划
    每人要赚十五石粮
    【本报太岳电】浮山范村赵美英互助大队之李凤花纺织小组，今冬计划每人以纺织生产赚回玉菱十五石，即等于全年农业生产的总值。该组共六个人，均为五十以上的老年妇女，她们年青时代备受地主剥削，如今翻过身来，发财致富的生产情绪非常高涨。六十二岁的刘善本母亲心急得晚上睡不着觉，半夜起来纺到五更。她们计划从阴历十月十六日起，每人自备棉花一斤作为资本，自弹自织，预计共需三十个工，织布九丈，价值五千二百元，可买回棉花二十二斤。如此周转三次，至明年阴历二月初即可织布一百六十九丈五尺，价值十万零一千四百元，可买玉茭九十二石一斗八升，除去六斤资本棉花的，石八斗外，每人便净赚十五石一斗三升。现第二次周转，经线已按上，占计计划会早日完成。（朗樵）
