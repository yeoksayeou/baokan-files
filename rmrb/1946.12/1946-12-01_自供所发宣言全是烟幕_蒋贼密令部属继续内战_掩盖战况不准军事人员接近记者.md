　　Self-Declared Declarations Are All Smoke Screens
　　Chiang Kai-shek Secretly Ordered Subordinates to Continue the Civil War
　　Concealing the War Situation and Prohibiting Military Personnel from Approaching Reporters

　　[This newspaper's report from the Jin-Lu-Yu Front, 28th] Documents captured from the Eighth Route Army that were labeled "Top Secret" prove that Chiang Kai-shek's ceasefire order issued on November 11th was actually an attack order with the determination to fight a major war. The only difference was the strict prohibition of publishing news. A unit under General Liu Bocheng, upon recovering Shangguan Village, 30 li southeast of Hua County in northern Henan on November 19th, and annihilating the headquarters of the 104th Brigade of the Kuomintang army's reorganized 41st Division, obtained a "Top Secret" document titled "Propaganda Guidance and Control Plan After the Issuance of the Ceasefire Order." The "Guidance Essentials" stated: "From the 11th of this month onwards, no new strongholds occupied by our army should be announced. If our army is attacked, it should be quickly publicized and the propaganda should be expanded accordingly." The "Implementation Measures" stated: "All military actions must be well concealed." The "Reporting Control" stated: "All pacification zones and command headquarters at all levels should strictly keep secret any war information that is inconsistent with our propaganda policy or unfavorable to our side, and must not allow reporters to find out. Except for senior military and political leaders or designated personnel who need to meet with reporters when necessary, all other personnel must be absolutely prohibited from approaching reporters to prevent leakage of secrets. Or use written methods to restrict reporters from automatically approaching our military and political personnel for interviews, and should politely refuse reporters to approach our troops." "The highest military organs in various regions should secretly dispatch special personnel to secretly contact the telegraph offices to secretly inspect the news telegrams sent by reporters, and if necessary, publish them or delay them on purpose." "The purpose of this guidance and control policy is to effectively control military news reports after the ceasefire. Guide the release of war reports related to news reporters and our spokespersons in various regions to prevent misreporting, so as to prevent the reactionaries from using it to create rumors, disturb hearing, and incite people's hearts." "In order to maintain extreme secrecy, a special communication method is formulated: (1) Officers of this department will travel by plane or train to transfer the documents. (2) When the responsible chiefs in various regions instruct their subordinates, they should also send special personnel to avoid leaking the news, and avoid using text, and do not use radio transmission. (3) When transferring the contents of the plan to relevant parties, do not explain the source." Note: The document captured this time is a mimeographed telegram from the headquarters of the 41st Division, No. 681 of the Reference Office, issued on November 14, 35th year of the Republic. The article stated: "I have just received a confidential document from the concurrent director Gu." When General Liu Bocheng commented on this document to reporters, he said: "For Chiang Kai-shek, you must learn from Lu Xun's saying, 'Think of the Tui Bei Tu in reverse.' The more he talks about peace and ceasefire, the more you should be careful that he will eat you!" (Li Pu)

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, November 28th. The Eighth Route Army of Ji-Lu-Yu, in the battle of annihilating the Chiang army's 104th Brigade of the 41st Division in Shangguan Village, Hua County, captured a secret order issued by Chiang Kai-shek on October 17th, which stated: "Chairman Chiang You (October) @ (17th) re-issued a handwritten order. Regarding the bandit issue, the government may soon issue a declaration, which is entirely for political purposes and will not have any impact on our district's suppression plan. It is hoped that you will concentrate on supervising and ordering, and not be misled by any propaganda or rumors, which will hinder the main purpose of our army's suppression of bandits."

　　自供所发宣言全是烟幕
  　蒋贼密令部属继续内战
  　掩盖战况不准军事人员接近记者
    【本报冀鲁豫前线廿八日电】从八路军缴获之“极机密”文件中，证明蒋介石颁发之自十一月十一日起的停战令，正是决心大打的攻击令。唯一的区别，仅在严禁发表新闻而已。刘伯承将军所属某部，于十一月十九日收复豫北滑县东南卅华里之上官村，歼灭国民党军整编第四十一师一○四旅旅部时，获得一题为“停战令颁发后宣传指导及控制计划”的“极机密”文件。在“指导要领”中称：“自本（十一）月十一日后，我军如有新占领之据点，不得发表。如我军被攻袭时，则应迅速发布，并相机扩大宣传。”其“实施办法”中称：“一切军事行动均须善为掩护。”其“报导控制”中称：“各绥靖区、各级司令部对战讯中与我宣传方针不符或不利于我方者，应严守秘密，切勿为记者探知。除各军政高级首长或经指定人员于必要时须接见记者外，其余人员须绝对禁止与记者接近，以防泄露机密。或用书面方法限制记者自动与我方军政人员接近或采访，并应婉拒记者接近我方各部队。”“各地军事最高机关应密派专人与各电报局密取联系，暗中检查记者所拍发之新闻电报，必要时或酌情发表或借故缓发。”“此种指导及控制之方针，以确实控制停战后军事新闻报导为目的。对各地新闻记者及我方发言人有关战报之发布，加以指导而杜绝乱报，以免反动派借以制造流言驱诼，扰乱听闻，煽惑人心。”“为保持极席机密起见，并特别制定传达法：（一）本部军官分乘飞机火车转送。（二）各地主管长官分饬所属时，亦应派遗专人，不得走露消息，并应避免使用文字，又不可用无线电传达。（三）计划内容各项转致各有关方面时，不可说明来源。”按：此次缴获之文件，系四十一师司令部之油印代电，参作字第六八一号，三十五年十一月十四日发出。文中谓：“顷奉兼主任顾机密件”。刘伯承将军对记者评论此项文件时说：“对蒋介石，你要学鲁迅说的‘推背图往反面想’，他越是说和平停战，你越是要当心他吃你！”（李普）
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十一月廿八日电】冀鲁豫八路军，于此次滑县上官村歼灭蒋军四十一师一零四旅战斗中，缴获蒋介石十月十七日发出之机密令一件，内称：“主席蒋酉（十月）＠（十七日）重发手令，对于匪部问题，政府不久或有宣言发表，此乃全为政治作用，而于我各区进剿计划，并不能发生任何影响，务希专心督令，不得受任何宣传与谣言之误解，妨碍我军剿匪之主旨。”
