    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 7th: In the self-defense war from November 13th to the end of the same month, the soldiers of the Guanzhong Sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, in coordination with the militia, killed or wounded 47 Chiang's soldiers, captured 316 alive, seized 8 machine guns, 151 rifles, and over 3,900 rounds of ammunition, and destroyed over a hundred bunkers and four earth forts. On the 17th of last month, when they recovered the fourteen villages including Beimou in western Yijun occupied by Chiang's troops, the local people offered local products such as walnuts, persimmons, and cigarettes to comfort the soldiers, and eagerly volunteered to stand guard for the soldiers. Old Man Gan brought two dou of corn flour and said, "It's better than anything that you've returned. Chiang's troops are unspeakably bad, truly utterly bad!"

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 7th: Part of Chiang's troops invaded Gao Yatou Village and other places on the Chishui border of the Guanzhong Sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia on the evening of the 2nd and 3rd. The local soldiers and civilians fought bravely in self-defense, killing or wounding 11 of them, capturing 110 Chiang's soldiers (self-defense force) including a company commander, seizing 52 machine guns and rifles, and over 7,000 rounds of ammunition. Only two of our defending soldiers were injured.
