　　Record of Meritorious Deeds of People's Heroes
    Yong Jin
    Defend the motherland! Defend the people! Defend the liberated areas! Defend our Chairman Mao! The heroes of the People's Army are being entered into the book of meritorious deeds one by one. On the morning of December 1st, I stepped into the residence of the Third Company of a certain field army unit. Amidst the heated sounds of "sharpening knives" (i.e., training), the cadres and soldiers enthusiastically discussed the call for "everyone to perform meritorious service." All the cadres and soldiers of the entire regiment should become heroes and establish meritorious service for the people. At the regimental headquarters, I saw a record of meritorious deeds of the People's Army, a 24-page book with a red silk cover, with the words "Record of Meritorious Deeds" written on it. I eagerly flipped through it. The first page was inscribed by a certain general: "Everyone strives to perform meritorious service, and everyone becomes a hero, in order to win the victory in the patriotic self-defense war." This further aroused my enthusiasm for reading it. Below were the brilliant achievements of the heroes. The first was Fan Chengzhou, the political instructor of the first battalion, followed closely by Zhao Jiqing, a new soldier who was actually an old hero. Before the war, Zhao Jiqing pushed a water cart in Beiping. After the Japanese occupied Beiping, he drifted to Shanxi and joined the artillery regiment of the Eighth Route Army as a gunner. He was wounded during the Hundred Regiments Offensive and was transferred to the 359th Brigade to participate in the production movement in Nanniwan, where he was selected as a labor hero. Later, he was transferred to the Northeast to participate in the defense of Siping. This autumn, he was wounded and returned home from Zhangjiakou. Two months ago, he took the lead in joining the army again, saying, "Although I am sick, Lao Jiang has betrayed the country. I must join the army to save the country and the people." He had just come from the turn-over team and participated in the Wutang battle, hitting two enemies with three shots and carrying back four guns. The third person was Liu Duande, a small artillery gunner from the Second Battalion. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was captured by the Japanese and forced to work as a coolie in the Northeast. After being liberated by the Soviet Red Army, he resolutely requested to join the Eighth Route Army. In the Huaiyang battle, he killed or wounded nineteen enemies. In the recent Wutang battle, he killed three enemies with one shot. As I flipped through the "Record of Meritorious Deeds" page by page, I saw a soldier named Zhang Qinggui, who had been liberated in the Jixian battle and was now an exemplary Communist Party member. He was always at the forefront in every battle. In the battle against the 181st Division, he captured a mortar and a heavy machine gun. During the battle of Huaiyang, his leg was hit by six shrapnel wounds, but he still insisted on leading the assault team to charge forward, killing two enemies. In the battle against He Guansan, he wounded three enemies with one shot. ... Encouraged by these brilliant heroic achievements, I continued to read. I was also surprised to be attracted by the name of "Little Eighth Route" Lei Yulin. He was only seventeen years old this year. He joined the army at the age of thirteen and became a communication orderly in the regimental headquarters. During the Hancun battle, Deputy Political Commissar × wanted him to transmit an order to Regiment Commander Wang in Zhangzhai. In a hundred-meter distance, enemy and our mountain artillery fiercely intertwined, and three comrades had already sacrificed in front. "Little Eighth Route" ignored everything and quickly and nimbly dashed over. When he ran to Regiment Commander Wang, his face had turned earthy. He reported to Regiment Commander Wang, "Deputy Political Commissar × said that when the bugle is blown, you should attack." After saying these words, he could no longer hold on and quietly lay down, saying, "I'm wounded in the waist!" This little hero's great behavior moved everyone who read the "Record of Meritorious Deeds." Let us wish him a speedy recovery. When I went out, I heard several soldiers talking enthusiastically. They said, "It would be a loss for an Eighth Route Army soldier not to be on the record of meritorious service!" I deeply felt that this red-glowing "Record of Meritorious Deeds" had two different symbols, that is, it symbolized the victory of the People's Army, and also symbolized the final destruction of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek.

　　人民英雄的功劳簿
    勇进
    保卫祖国！保卫人民！保卫解放区！保卫我们的毛主席！人民军队英雄们一个个刊入功劳簿。十二月一日的早晨，我踏进了野战军某部三中队的驻地，干部和战士们在火热的“磨刀”（即练兵）声中，热烈的谈论着“人人立功”的号召，全团的干部战士都要成为英雄，为人民建立功劳。在团部我看到一本人民军队的功劳簿，一个二十四开的红绸封面本子，写着：“功劳簿”三个字。我怀着高度的热忱去翻阅它。第一页是某某将军的题字：“人人争立功，个个成英雄，才能争取爱国自卫战争的胜利，”这更加引起我翻阅的热情。下面便是英雄们辉煌灿烂的业绩了。头一个是一营教导员范承周，和他紧挨着是赵吉庆，这是个新战士，实际上是个老英雄。赵吉庆战前在北平推水车，日本占北平后，他流落到山西，参加了八路军炮兵团当炮手，百团大战时，他负伤了，被调到三五九旅，参加了南泥湾的生产运动，被选为劳动英雄，后来又被调到东北，参加了四平街保卫战，今秋他从张家口负伤回家，两个月前他又带头参军，他说：“我虽然有病，但是老蒋卖国了，我一定得参加军队救国救民，”他刚从翻身团来，便参加了吴堂战斗，三枪打着了两个敌人，还背了四支枪回来。第三名是二营小炮射手刘端得，抗日战争中，他被日本抓到东北做苦工，被苏联红军解放回家后，他坚决要求参加八路军，在淮阳战斗中，他毙伤敌人十九个，在最近的吴堂战斗中，他又一炮打死了三个敌人。我一页一页地翻着“功劳簿”，看到一个叫张清贵的战士，是汲县战斗中解放过来的，现在已是一个模范的共产党员了，他每次作战都在最前面，打一八一师，他得了一门迫击炮，一挺重机枪。打淮阳时，他腿上被炸弹打了六个窟窿，仍坚持着率领突击队冲上去，打死两个敌人。打何冠三时，他一枪打伤了三个敌人。……我为这灿烂的英雄伟绩鼓舞着看下去，我又惊奇的为“小八路”雷玉林的名字所吸引，他今年才十七岁，十三岁参军就当团部的通讯员，这次韩村战斗，×副政委要他传一个命令到张砦王团长那里，在一个百米的距离的地带，敌我山炮猛烈地交织着，前面已经有三个同志牺牲了，“小八路”却不顾一切，迅速敏捷地飞奔过去，当他跑到王团长的面前，他的脸已经变成土色了，他向王团长报告说：“×副政委说什么时候吹号，你们就攻。”说完了这句话，他已经支持不住了，才安静地躺下来说：“我腰上负伤了！”这个小英雄伟大行为，感动每个看“功劳簿”的人，让我们祝福他早日恢复健康吧。我出门时，听到几个战士热烈地谈论着，他们说：“当一个八路军，不上功劳薄才亏呢！”我深深感到这个闪耀着红光的“功劳簿”，有着两个不同的象征，那就是象征人民军队的胜利，也象征着卖国贼蒋介石的最后毁灭。
