　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th -- According to reports from the Peiping Xin Sheng Bao and Shanghai Wen Hui Bao: The people's armed uprising in Jiangxi has spread throughout the vast areas of the south, north, and west. Several detachments of the people's armed uprising along the Nanchang-Jiujiang railway in the north had, by November, grown into large teams of several hundred people. In addition to rifles, their weapons mostly include recoilless guns and machine guns. Their composition includes farmers and refugees from the Anti-Japanese War, with the most numerous being soldiers from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangxi provinces who have become displaced. They were either forced by heavy taxes or denied the opportunity to return home and find employment by the Chiang government, leading them to take desperate risks. Their activities have reached two or three li outside Jiujiang City. In the past month, the weapons of the guard soldiers at the Kuomintang airfield north of the Jiujiang estuary were also seized by the rebels. When Chiang Kai-shek stayed in Mount Lu during August and September, the Jiangxi military and political authorities dispatched heavy troops to guard the southern line and the surrounding areas of Mount Lu. However, according to Xin Sheng Bao, at that time, the rebels in the area were still operating in small groups. The momentum of the people's armed uprising on the eastern shore of Poyang Lake is also very strong, and they have raised a white flag with the slogan "Officials force the people to rebel." In the south, in Ji'an and Yu counties and the border area of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan, there are several detachments of people's armed uprising. One detachment led by Zeng Ying resisted the "encirclement and suppression" by the Chiang army in October. In October, the people's armed uprising in the west temporarily entered Hunan Province. According to Xin Sheng Bao, the detachment may retreat back.
