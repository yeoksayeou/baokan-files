　　Highly Develop Consciousness to Help Poor Brothers Overturn Their Lives
　　Village Cadres in Pingshun and Other Counties Withdraw Excess Fruit
　　[This newspaper Pingshun news] In order to thoroughly implement "land to the tiller" by leveling the gaps and making up the deficiencies, the land reform check and training class here recently, after introspection, cadres developed a high degree of class consciousness and successively withdrew excess land, houses, and cheaply bought fruits of struggle to help poor brothers overturn their lives. ×× village cadre Ma Qunlong said: "I didn't have an acre of land in the past, but now there are still many people in the village who haven't overturned their lives, but I was the first to be allocated more than nine acres of good land. I voluntarily withdraw three acres of good land for the masses." Wang Shuangkou, political director of Wangqu, said: "I have bought a lot of land in the past few years, and I bought another five acres in this year's mass movement. Now my family has an average of four acres of good land per person, but there are still many people in the village who have not overturned their lives. I originally wanted to give some to the masses, but I was afraid of looking bad; later, I thought of the situation when the creditors surrounded the door on the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, forcing me to pay the bills, and I realized that giving back to the masses is not a shameful thing, the masses are our own family." Now he is determined to allocate a part to the masses who have not yet overturned their lives. (Wang Julin)
　　[This newspaper Changzhi first day electricity] In order to obtain a thorough turnaround for all peasants, Yushe Chengguan is checking the peasant turnaround movement in recent years. It was discovered that because the fruits of struggle in the past were obtained by whoever calculated them, as a result, there are still fourteen extremely poor households that have not been able to overturn their lives to this day. After in-depth inspection and reflection, the village chief, Zhang Bingzhi, voluntarily gave up 11 mu of land and distributed it to class brothers who had not overturned their lives, and made a self-criticism at the mass meeting. Under his influence, the former village chief, Wang Shouyi, also returned all the fruits of the struggle he had bought cheaply and distributed them to the extremely poor who had not overturned their lives. The peasants who obtained the fruits all said: "It is true that peasants all over the world are one family, we can turn over even if we haven't done the calculations." (Tong Long, You Zhang, Fu Sheng)
　　[Another telegram] After cadres in Heshun Songyan Village reviewed their thinking, they automatically returned the excess gains to the masses, greatly improving the relationship between cadres and the masses. When the village discussed the issues of implementing "leveling and replenishment" and uniting the vast number of peasants at a meeting of cadres and activists, political director Zhang Xuecheng reviewed and said: "In the past, I thought that the mistakes were all made by the masses. I only thought that we were working day and night to help everyone turn over, but they still didn't support us. After the district meeting for review, I realized that only when everyone turns over and everyone benefits can we unite. I will first withdraw one mu of Dongping land." The director of the cooperative said: "I bought the fruits of struggle cheaply, which is wrong. I am willing to withdraw three mu of land and five houses so that everyone can turn over completely." But there are still a few individuals who have reviewed, but dare not withdraw, fearing that the masses will say they are not good. After continuing in-depth review, they all realized that correcting mistakes will gain more support from the masses. Others also successively returned things, a total of fifteen houses and ten mu of land were returned. (Li Fuchang)

　　高度发扬自觉性帮助穷兄弟翻身
    平顺等县村干退出多分果实
    【本报平顺讯】为填平补齐彻底实行耕者有其田，此间翻身检查训练班，最近经过反省，干部发扬高度阶级自觉，纷纷退出多分土地、房屋及贱买斗争果实，帮助贫苦兄弟翻身。××村干部马群龙说：“我过去一亩地也没有，现在村里还有许多群众没翻身，自己却先分了九亩多好地，我自愿退出三亩好地给群众。”王曲政治主任王双科说：“我这几年买地已不少了，在今年群运中又买了五亩，现在我家每口平均四亩好地，可是村里还有许多群众没翻身，本想分出一些给群众，但又怕丑看；后来想起过去腊月三十日债主把门子围了，逼着讨账的情形，才觉得退给群众并不是丑事，群众是咱的自家人。”现在他已决心分出一部给尚未翻身的群众。（王巨林）
    【本报长治一日电】为求得全体农民彻底翻身，榆社城关正检查数年来农民翻身运动。发现由于过去斗争果实是谁算下谁得，结果还有十四户赤贫至今未能翻身。经过深入的检查与反省，村长张炳志，自动让出土地十一亩，分给没翻身的阶级弟兄，并在群众大会上作了自我批评。在他的影响下，前任村长王守义，亦将自己贱买的斗争果实，全部退出，分给未翻身的赤贫。得到果实的农民都说：“果真天下农民是一家，咱没有算账也能翻身”。（通隆、友章、福生）
    【又电】和顺松烟村干部检讨思想后，自动将多得果实退回群众，大大改善了干部与群众关系。该村在干部与积极分子会议上讨论实行“填平补齐”及团结广大农民问题时，政治主任张学成检讨说：“我过去认为错误都是群众的，只想咱们没明没夜为大家翻身，还不拥护咱，这回区上开会检讨后才想通了，只有都翻身，都有利，才能团结起来，我先退出东平地一亩”。合作社主任说：“我贱买了斗争果实，这是不对的，我愿退出三亩地、五间房叫大家都翻透身。”但还有个别人，检讨是检讨了，就是不敢退，怕群众说自己不好，经继续深入检讨，都认识了纠正错误，会取得群众更加拥护。其他人也纷纷退东西，总共退出房十五间、地十亩。（李福昌）
