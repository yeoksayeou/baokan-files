　　Oppose Chiang Kai-shek Troops Seizing Grain
    Launch Empty House Movement
    People in Dinghe Invaded Area Launch Anti-Exploitation
    [This newspaper's report from Jiluyu, 19th] The people in the Chiang-occupied areas of Dingtao and Heze are launching resistance movements against the brutal exploitation by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. After Chiang's troops occupied Dingtao and Heze, they frantically demanded grain and money. In the Huangdian area of ​​Dingtao, each mu of land was required to provide ten catties of wheat, six catties of sorghum, and 130 yuan at a time. In the Wanghaotun area of ​​Heze, they came to demand several times a day, and in the past month, each mu of land has already yielded more than 5,000 yuan. The "Homecoming Legion" local bullies and landlords also came to "settle old scores." Landlords in Dazhangji demanded 40,000 yuan per mu from farmers who had reduced rents, and landlords in Zhangdazhuang demanded 400 catties of wheat and 250 catties of rice per mu. This endless exploitation is forcing the peasants to fight the enemy in various ways. A peasant association chairman in a village south of Heze city joined the guerrillas, and the masses hid his old mother and dispersed and preserved the belongings in his home overnight. The people in the Dingtao area implemented the empty house movement. Once, when the enemy came to seize grain with carts, they only managed to get 100 catties of grain after half a day. Huang Rulin, the village chief of a certain concentrated village, did not support Chiang Kai-shek's troops. The enemy's lackey, Cui Ziting, told Chiang Kai-shek's troops, "Old man Huang only supports the Eighth Route Army, not you." A grain collection squad leader slapped old man Huang twice. Old man Huang was furious and kicked the Chiang Kai-shek squad leader, sending him tumbling. He said, "Anyway, you can't survive under old Chiang here, let's fight him!" Whenever our comrades came, old man Huang would always kindly pull us to a secluded place and ask if there were any supplies to eat. Under the active activities of our army's guerrillas in conjunction with the masses, Chiang Kai-shek's troops and their henchmen were forced to gradually retreat into the city.

    定荷侵陷区人民开展反压榨
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】定陶荷泽蒋占区人民，正对蒋军的残酷压榨展开抵抗运动。蒋军侵占定陶、荷泽后，疯狂要粮、要款，定陶黄店一带，一次每亩地就要十斤麦，六斤高粱，一百三十块钱。荷泽王浩屯一带，一天就来要好几次，一月以来每亩地已出五千元之多，“还乡团”恶霸地主也来“倒算账”，大张集的地主向减了租的农民每亩地要赔偿费四万元，张大庄的地主，每亩地要四百斤麦，二百五十斤米。这种无止境的榨取，逼使着农民用种种的办法，在和敌人搏斗着。荷泽城南某村农会长参加游击队去，群众就把他的老母隐蔽起来，把家里的东西连夜分散保存。定陶××一带的人民实行了空舍运动，一次敌人拉着大车来抢粮，半天只弄了一百斤粮食。某集村长黄如林不支应蒋军，敌人狗腿子崔志亭告诉了蒋军说：“黄老汉只支应八路，不支应你们。”一个催粮班长向黄老汉打了两个耳光，黄老汉怒火冲天，朝着蒋军班长一脚下去踢了个鹞子翻身。他说：“老蒋在这里反正是不能活，给他拚了吧！”每逢我们的同志去了，黄老汉总是亲切的把我们拉到一僻静的地方，问还有给养吃没有。在我军的游击队结合群众积极活动下，迫使蒋军和它的爪牙逐步向城里收缩。
