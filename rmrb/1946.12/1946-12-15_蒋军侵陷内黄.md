    Chi Lu Yu Frontline Report, December 12th: On the 8th, a local armed force of our Yu Su Anhui region severely damaged the Chiang Kai-shek security force's 2nd regiment, which was advancing south along the Qi (County) Tai (Kang) highway towards Longqu Town (approximately 50 li north of Taikang). We captured more than 300 of these enemy troops alive, and seized two light and heavy machine guns, and 150 rifles. After completing the task of annihilating the enemy, our army took the initiative to move to the outskirts of Longqu Town. When the enemy ventured out the next day, we struck them again, seizing one light machine gun, 17 rifles, and more than 10 pistols.
