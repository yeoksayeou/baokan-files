How to Unite Ninety Percent of the Masses: One of the Experiences in Mass Mobilization in the Enxia Region

The new district masses most hate treacherous landlords and despotic landlords because they endanger the interests of all classes. When we shouted "Avenge hatred, redress grievances," all classes acted in unison. For example, when Gao Zhuang struggled against the traitorous landlord Li Maozhu, even his uncle and sister-in-law participated in reasoning. In the struggle in Sanchang Village, 35 out of 58 households in the entire village complained. Not only were middle peasants absorbed into the movement, but middle peasants were also made to participate in leadership. Of the 345 mass leaders in the entire district, 160 were middle peasants. However, some villages still clung to the circle of "laborers, tenants, and poor peasants," excluding middle peasants from the struggle. We emphasized the slogan "More people, more power, middle and poor peasants are one family" and emphasized to the cadres to "break the circle of households" (referring to one person per household), "everyone, men, women, old, and young, work together," thus forming a broad mass movement, even women were brought along. For example, Beiyan Village was a feudal fortress. With the consent of the masses in the village, a joint struggle of more than a dozen villages was launched. The daughters and daughters-in-law of the surrounding villages also lined up to participate in the village, with gongs and drums, the masses competing to talk about the victory of the struggle, the distribution of land, and the distribution of money, very affectionately. The masses in this area were united, and in this way, the situation in the entire first district was opened in a few days. Facts have proved that in villages where the interests of middle peasants are not harmed, the whole village is very united, and the organization is strong and consolidated (such as Gao Zhuang and Men Wangzhuang). Organized masses account for 40% to 70%, and households account for more than 90%. On the contrary, in Yu Wangzhuang, because the interests of the middle peasants were harmed, the masses said, "Those with more than three mu are landlords, and they should not be given a share of the fruits." As a result, many middle peasants panicked, giving the landlords the opportunity to deceive the struggled households into establishing a secret society to carry out a "counter-offensive."

Regarding the distribution of fruits, we adopted two basic principles: from bottom to top and the same distribution inside and outside the association. Only in this way can we eliminate the extremely poor peasants, realize the principle of "land to the tiller," and unite all the unorganized masses to establish the superiority of the masses. These two principles have been adhered to from the beginning in the Enxia area. At the beginning, some middle peasants in Zhu Zhuang and Gao Zhuang, especially middle peasant activists, could not understand this. It was only after everyone's discussion, brewing, and debate that the problem was solved. After having the example of advanced villages, it was easy to implement the above principles. Land is divided according to class differences, and floating wealth is divided according to rank differences, and all classes are very satisfied. In addition, it should be noted that wealthy middle peasants must also get a little bit, even if it is very little. For example, the masses in Wen Xin Zhuang proposed, "Everyone should get a little bit, it's a relief. Those who have been struggled and those who have hired labor should not be given a share." As a result, out of 304 households in the entire village, only 14 households did not get a share, including 4 landlord families and 10 rich peasant families. In this way, the masses who were given a share of the fruits naturally became one family, and the wealthy middle peasants were also united. The same distribution inside and outside the association can satisfy the vast number of unorganized masses, eliminate the gaps provoked by the despotic landlords, and enable the mass organization to develop greatly. For example, after Wen Xin Zhuang distributed the fruits, ideological education was carried out. The Farmers' Association expanded from 104 people to 255 people, and the Women's Association expanded from 70 people to 180 people. The poor peasant Feng Xiaoruo usually liked to argue and was not satisfied with the Farmers' Association. During the famine, all four mu of land were used up. This spring, he did not redeem the land when he redeemed it. This time, he was given three mu of land, and he automatically joined the Farmers' Association and ran to the Farmers' Association every day to ask if there was anything to do before going out. An old man in Liu Xian Zhuang also firmly refused the fruits at first, thinking that "if you divide things, you still have to be in the group, and this old age can't run." After the explanation, he understood and became active.

    怎样团结百分之九十群众
    恩夏地区群运经验之一
    新区群众最痛恨的是奸性地主与恶霸地主。因为他们危害着各阶层的利益。在我们喊出了“有仇报仇，有冤报冤”时，各阶层就一致行动起来。如高庄斗争汉奸地主李茂竹时，连他的叔叔，弟媳都参加了说理。三教堂村斗争中，全村五十八户，诉苦的就有三十五户。不仅吸收了中农参加运动，而且使中农参加领导。全区三百四十五个群众领袖，中农即占一六○人。但有些村子还固守着“雇佃贫”的圈子，把中农关在斗争之外。我们则强调“人多力量大，中贫农是一家”的口号，并向干部强调“踢破户”（指一户一人而言）的圈子“男女老幼大家一齐干”，这样就形成一个广泛的群众运动，连妇女也都一同带起来了。如北沿村是一个封建堡垒，在该村群众同意下，展开了十几个村的联合斗争，周围村的闺女媳妇也列队到该村参加，锣鼓喧天，群众与群众之间争着谈论斗争胜利、分地、分钱的情形，非常亲热，这一片村的群众，都团结起来，这样几天就打开全一区的局面。事实证明：凡不损害中农利益的村庄，全村就很团结，组织也强大巩固（如高庄、门王庄），有组织的群众就达到百分之四十到七十，以户计算则占百分之九十以上；相反的，于王庄因损害了中农利益，群众都说：“三亩以上的是地主，分果实不应分给他们。”结果不少中农恐慌，给了地主以诱骗被斗户成立会门，进行“反攻”的机会。
    关于果实分配，我们采取从下往上与会内外一样分的两个基本原则。如此才能消灭赤贫农，实现耕者有其田，也才能将全部无组织的群众团结起来，建立群众的优势。这两个原则在恩夏地区是从开始就坚持了的。开始时，朱庄、高庄有些中农，特别是中农积极分子是想不通的，经过大家讨论、酝酿与争论才解决了。有了先进村的榜样以后，就很容易进行贯彻上述原则了。分土地按级数差别，分浮财按等数差别，各阶层都很满意。此外还须注意的是富裕中农，也必须分到一点，即使很少都是好的。如温辛庄群众提出：“大家都分点，总算出了气了。被斗户和有雇工的不能分。”结果全村三○四户，只十四户没分到，其中地主四家，富农十家。这样很自然的分到果实的群众都成了一家人，富裕中农也被团结起来。会内会外一样分，能得到广大无组织的群众满意，便消灭了恶霸地主挑拨的空隙，使群众组织得到大量的发展。如温辛庄分果实后，又进行了思想教育，农会由一○四人扩大到二五五人，妇会由七○人扩大到一八○人。贫农冯小弱平日爱讲个死理，不满意农会，灾荒时，四亩地都弄光了，今春赎地时没有赎回；这次分给他三亩地，他就自动入了农会，并每天跑到农会里问问有事没有，然后再出门。刘贤庄一个老头，开始也是坚决不要果实，认为“分了东西还得在组，这大年纪又跑不动。”经过解释才明白了，也积极起来。
