Suppressing Evil
One of the Experiences of the Ningnan Mass Movement

    At the beginning of the mass movement in Ningnan, the militia captain of Gao Village had just been assassinated by special agents, and the masses were in a state of panic and uncertainty. The First District convened a district-wide meeting of militia village cadres, held a memorial service and public burial, and proposed: "Avenge the dead!" The special agents who committed the murder were also executed, but the masses still dared not act. The county party committee then decided to use armed forces to cooperate in breaking the deadlock. The First and Second Districts each concentrated a militia backbone company, and another company was drawn from the Third District, stationed in complex villages in the First District. The Public Security Bureau organized an armed work team to launch surprise attacks to solve cases. More than 100 suspected elements from the First and Second Districts were gathered for education. After the work team cooperated with the militia company to go to the villages, some first checked household registrations, investigated bad people, and convened meetings of those who had served as puppet soldiers, ordering them to go through self-confession procedures and take an oath to perform meritorious service. Some first detained traitors, evil landlords, and special agents, and then mobilized the masses. Some first exposed the "capitulationists" in the farmers' association, and then prepared for secret meetings to air grievances. Cadres expressed their determination to the masses: "We will not leave until we succeed, we will not leave until we do well." They adopted an attitude of responding to every request, doing whatever the masses asked, and handling things according to their wishes, resolutely emboldening activists and supporting the masses. This struck a blow at the arrogance of special agents and landlords, suppressed evil, broke through the atmosphere of terror and depression, and excited the broad masses. Facts have proven that this was absolutely necessary in areas where feudal die-hard puppet forces were rampant at the beginning of the movement.

    镇压邪气
    宁南群运经验之一
    宁南群众运动开始时，高庄民兵队长刚刚被特务暗杀，群众情绪恐慌不定。一区即召开了全区民兵村干部大会，进行追悼公葬，提出：“为死者报仇！”又把行凶特务枪决了，群众还是不敢动。县委于是决定武装配合打开局面。一、二区各集中一个民兵基干连，又从三区抽调一个连，住在一区复杂的村庄，公安局组织武工队突击破案。并把一、二区一百多嫌疑分子集中起来教育。工作组配合民兵连到村后，有的先清查户口，调查坏人，召集当过伪军的开会，令其办理自新手续，宣誓立功。有的先扣押汉奸、恶霸地主、特务，再发动群众。有的先检举农会里的“走里分子”，再酝酿串连诉苦开会。干部向群众表示领导决心：“弄不开不走，作不好不离。”抱定有求必应的态度，群众要求啥干啥，说怎办就怎办，坚决给积极分子壮胆，给群众撑腰。这样一来，打击了特务地主的凶焰，镇压了邪气，冲破了恐怖消沉局面，兴奋了广大群众。事实证明了在封建顽伪势力猖獗的地区，运动初期这样做是完全必要的。
