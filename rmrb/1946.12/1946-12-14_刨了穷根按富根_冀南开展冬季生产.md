Southern Hebei (Jinan) peasants who have been emancipated are launching winter sideline production with fervent enthusiasm, their slogan being "Uprooting the roots of poverty and planting the seeds of wealth." In Huang Gou Village, Jize Third District, under the leadership of district labor hero Cui Laocheng, forty-eight mutual aid teams were organized to engage in production such as lumber mills, grain transportation, cotton ginning, and the establishment of cooperatives. His wife (the director of the Women's Association) led the women of the village to organize more than fifty weaving groups, which have already woven fourteen bolts of cloth, earning 28,000 yuan. Fudong Village organized forty-three weaving groups, producing twenty bolts of white cloth per day, earning over 50,000 yuan. The whole village proposed the slogan: "Weaving models are the most glorious" to develop weaving. In Beifengzheng Village, Second District, the masses collectively invested 72,000 yuan to open a lumber mill and an oil press. The village cooperative has organized a transportation team, Dong You's team pulled a load of mats from Xingtai, earning 15,000 yuan. Twenty weaving groups were organized, and no woman was idle. In various villages in Yaolu Fourth District, a weaving craze has been set off. Labor hero Zhang Linsen of Guanzhai organized more than forty weaving groups and dug nineteen underground kilns, each capable of accommodating more than twenty spinning wheels and several looms. Weaving has now begun. The masses say, "If you want to enjoy happiness, the kiln is a money tree." Xu Gen and his wife, who had just returned from fleeing famine in Changjiaying Village, spin and knead a catty of thread every day, earning a dividend of 1,000 yuan. They have now bought two shi and six dou of red grain, eight jin of raw cotton, and made four new cotton-padded clothes. The masses in Longtangpu Village, Feixiang Fifth District, used the cotton bows and a donkey compensated by the landlords as winter production tools. After more than a month of work, the poorest peasants have already received 2,500 yuan.
