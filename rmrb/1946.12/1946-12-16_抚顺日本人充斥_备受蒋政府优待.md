　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 12th: According to a report in the Tianjin Yishi Daily on the 5th, Japanese reside in Fushun in great numbers and enjoy preferential treatment. The Chiang government is doing everything it can to show "friendliness" towards them. According to the newspaper, "Currently, there are 1,454 Japanese households in Fushun, consisting of 2,997 men and 3,134 women. Among them, over 1,900 are so-called 'retained technical personnel.' These individuals even form a special class, possessing considerable wealth and associating with high-ranking officials. Because the government's receiving officials are only capable of seizing assets but are not good at management, they have to treat these Japanese as honored guests. These Japanese travel in cars, spend lavishly at banquets, and lead extremely luxurious lives. Furthermore, most of the Fushun coal mine and its affiliated businesses are still occupied by Japanese in high positions. The authorities are now planning to establish a middle school for the children of Japanese employees. It is heard that the school site has been found and the teachers who have been hired are all Japanese. Upon hearing this news, our miners are extremely indignant, and there is a public outcry. A miner told a reporter: 'Many of our workers' children are deprived of education due to poverty, but the Japanese receive special treatment. They regard our Chinese workers as mere weeds.' They are now brewing a labor strike to protest against those in charge of establishing the Japanese middle school. The Fushun Coal Mine Hospital is large in scale, and the majority of doctors and nurses are still Japanese. They are often arrogant, causing many of our own people to hold back." It is precisely because Chiang Kai-shek is implementing a policy of "loving the enemy" that the remnants of Japanese fascist bandits can continue their secret activities. According to the newspaper, "A few days ago, Japanese in Fushun organized the Black Dragon Society, possessing weapons and shortwave radios."

　　抚顺日本人充斥  备受蒋政府优待
    【新华社延安十二日电】据天津益世报五日透露，抚顺日侨充斥，享受优待，蒋政府对他们极尽“友善”之能事。据该报称：“现抚顺尚有日侨一、四五四户，男子二、九九七口，女子三、一三四口，其中有一千九百余名系所谓‘留用技术人员’，这些人中并有一种特殊阶级，手中甚为富足，结交达官贵人。因政府接收大员只能劫收，不善经营，故不得不待之如上宾。彼等出入乘坐汽车每赴宴会一掷千金，生活极尽奢侈。又抚顺煤矿及附属事业大部仍被日人窃据上位，当局现正为日侨员工子弟筹设中学校，校址已觅妥，教师已聘定者闻均为日人。我矿工闻讯后群情愤激，舆论哗然。矿工某君向记者称：‘我工人子弟多因困于生活而失学，唯待日人特殊。视我国工人如草芥。’现渠等正酝酿工潮，向主持建立日人中学校者抗议。抚顺煤矿医院规模宏大，医生看护什九仍为日人。彼等多盛气凌人，以致自己人多裹足不前。”正由于蒋介石推行“要爱敌人”之政策，使日寇法西斯残余得以继续其秘密活动。据该报称：“数日前即有日人在抚顺组织黑龙会，持有武器及短波无线电。”
