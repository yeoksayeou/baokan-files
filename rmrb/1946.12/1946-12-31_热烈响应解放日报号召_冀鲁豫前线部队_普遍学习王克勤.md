　　Enthusiastically Respond to the Call of *Liberation Daily*:
    Frontline Troops in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
    Universally Study Wang Keqin
    [Dispatch from our reporting team on the 29th] The *Liberation Daily*'s editorial calling for the "Launch of the Wang Keqin Movement" has sparked enthusiastic responses among frontline troops in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. After reading the editorial, all commanders, fighters, and political workers in a certain field army where Wang Keqin is stationed regarded it as the highest honor. They actively studied and discussed the editorial. The Party Committee immediately decided to make the Wang Keqin Movement the direction of future work in the company. Comrade Wang Keqin recently caught a severe cold due to checking shelters and sentry posts at night. Upon hearing this, Chief Zhu of the Health Department went early in the morning to personally provide treatment. Each squad of the 226 Unit also sent representatives to offer congratulations. When the representatives shouted slogans and rushed to the door of Wang Keqin's squad, handing the congratulatory letter to Wang Keqin, he was too moved to speak. A forum was held during the congratulations, and everyone unanimously expressed that this was the glory of the entire unit. They must not be complacent and must cultivate and create more Wang Keqin squads to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee. Squad Leader Li Zhuangk of the representative squad said, "Our squad has discussed the Wang Keqin squad two or three times and is determined to learn from the Wang Keqin squad. We hope that Comrade Wang Keqin will create more new experiences and help everyone progress." The current squad leader of the Wang Keqin squad, Comrade Zhang Taiping, said, "My ability is very poor, not as good as the platoon leader (Wang Keqin has been promoted to platoon leader). I am determined to do a good job with the squad and always maintain the glorious tradition of the Wang Keqin squad." Deputy Squad Leader Li Tieru said, "It's glorious to be in this squad! Even Chairman Mao knows about it." Although Comrade Wang Keqin is sick, he expressed his determination to lead the entire platoon into a model platoon. Next time there is a mission, he will go to the battlefield even if he is sick and will definitely make the entire platoon famous.

　　热烈响应解放日报号召
    冀鲁豫前线部队
    普遍学习王克勤
    【本报记者团二十九日电】解放日报号召“展开王克勤运动”的社论，在冀鲁豫前线部队中已掀起热烈响应，王克勤所在的某野战兵团读到该社论后，全体指战员及政工人员均引为无上光荣，纷纷研究讨论这一社论，党委曾立即决定把王克勤运动作为今后的连队工作方向。王克勤同志最近因晚间查棚、查哨得重感冒，卫生处朱处长闻讯，一早就去亲为治疗。二二六部队各小队并推派代表去祝贺，当代表们高呼口号涌到王克勤班门口，把祝贺信递到王克勤手中时，他感动的说不出话来。在祝贺中并举行座谈会，大家一致表示这是全部队的光荣，决不能自满，一定要培养和创造更多的王克勤班，来回答党中央的号召。代表李壮克班长说：“我们班已把王克勤班讨论了两三次，决心要向王克勤班看齐，并希望王克勤同志多创造新的经验多帮助大家进步。”现任王克勤班班长张太平同志说：“我能力很差，不及排长（王克勤已升为排长），我有决心把班弄好，永远保持王克勤班的光荣传统。”副班长李铁茹同志表示：“在这个班可光荣哩！连毛主席都知道。”王克勤同志虽在病中，但他表示决心要把全排带成模范排，下次有任务，带病也要上战场，一定把全排打出名来。
