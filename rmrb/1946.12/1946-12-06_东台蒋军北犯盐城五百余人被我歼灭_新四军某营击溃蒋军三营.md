Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd. The New Fourth Army on the southern front of Jiangsu and Anhui annihilated 500 invading Chiang troops and destroyed two armored speedboats. Chiang's troops occupying the Dongtai-Xinghua line, in order to salvage their defeat on the northern front, extracted all of their only mobile forces, the 83rd Division (formerly the 100th Army) and the 67th Division (formerly the Honorary 2nd Division), and advanced north from Dongtai towards Yancheng. From the 26th to the 29th of last month, their vanguard, carrying river crossing equipment and accompanied by more than 20 artillery pieces, attacked Dingxi Town, more than 10 miles northeast of Dongtai, along the Fan Gong Embankment in three routes, by land and water. The New Fourth Army waited until a battalion-sized regiment on the eastern route risked crossing the Dahe River several miles south of Dingxi before launching a combined attack from the east, north, and west. Most of the Chiang troops in that battalion were annihilated, and the scattered remnants are currently being pursued. On the same day, the Chiang troops on the central route were also repelled, while three armored speedboats of the Chiang troops invading via waterways on the western route were sunk by the New Fourth Army. The remaining speedboat fled in panic.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd. A certain battalion of the New Fourth Army created an example of defeating the many with the few. On the morning of the 19th, three battalions of the 513th Regiment of the 171st Division of the Chiang Army's 7th Army, carrying 20 large and small artillery pieces, and under the cover of American-made Chiang planes, advanced north from Huaiyin, fiercely attacking Quzhuang, northeast of Dingji and Tangfang. Chen Duanzhang, the deputy company commander of the 9th Company of a certain battalion of the New Fourth Army, waited for the Chiang troops to approach before shouting an order to fire, and grenades flew like rain, knocking down more than 20 Chiang soldiers. Han Hongshui, a soldier in the 2nd Squad of the 8th Company, repelled more than 10 Chiang soldiers with two grenades. Soldier Lu Daheng shot and killed three Chiang soldiers with three shots. Shen Xiangzhu, a new soldier who was liberated from Chaoyangji, knocked down two Chiang soldiers before being wounded himself, but he continued to fight. Under the heroic command of all the officers and soldiers of the battalion, the Chiang troops were finally repelled, with more than a hundred of them killed or wounded.

    【新华社华中三日电】苏皖南线新四军歼灭进犯蒋军五百余，击毁装甲汽艇两艘。侵占东台兴化一线之蒋军，为挽救其北线的败局，乃抽出其仅有的机动兵力八十三师（原一百军）及六十七师（原荣誉二师）两个师全部，自东台北犯盐城，上月二十六日至二十九日，其先头部队携带渡河器材，附炮二十余门，沿范公堤分水陆三路进攻东台北十余里丁溪镇。新四军待其东路一团营冒险渡过丁溪南数里之大河后，即于东南北三面合击，该营蒋军大部被歼，现正在追歼其零星残部中。同日中路蒋军亦被击退，而西路由水道进犯之蒋军装甲汽艇三艘，被新四军击沉二艘，余一艘则仓惶窜回。
    【新华社华中二日电】新四军某营创造以少胜多的范例。十九日上午，蒋军第七军一七一师五一三团三个营，携大小炮二十门，在美制蒋机掩护下，由淮阴北犯，猛攻丁集、糖坊东北方之屈庄。新四军某营九连连副陈端章，待蒋军接近时，一声喊打，手榴弹如雨般飞过去，二十多个蒋军躺倒了。八连二班战士韩洪水，以两个手榴弹打退十多个蒋军，战士陆大衡，三枪击毙三个蒋军。朝阳集解放过来的新战士沈向柱，击倒两个蒋军后，自己负伤，但仍坚持战斗，在全营指战员英勇指挥下终于击退蒋军，共毙伤其百余人。
