Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 9th: Hong Kong dispatch: The Hong Kong and Kowloon All Circles Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance issued a statement on November 18th, opposing the illegal "National Assembly" convened by the Kuomintang party alone, stating: "The National Assembly now being held in Nanjing is convened by the Kuomintang government in violation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and monopolized by one party, just like Cao Kun's bribery election in the 12th year of the Republic of China. It is a historical farce." Subsequently, on the 20th, the Alliance invited more than 80 representatives from people's organizations in Hong Kong and Kowloon to hold a current affairs symposium at the Grand Hall of the Six Nations Hotel. Professor Xiao Junying and writer Huang Yaomian, who had just arrived from Chongqing, were invited to speak first. Mr. Xiao said: The convening of the "National Assembly" is because the four families of Chiang, Kong, Song, and Chen have a huge property of 200 million US dollars, and they want to use this puppet "National Assembly" to legalize their illegal property. Mr. Huang pointed out that the Kuomintang authorities claimed to invite democrats to participate in the "National Assembly," but true democrats would never be fooled into making up his dictatorial constitution. Writer Wu Huaxu then spoke, saying: The "National Assembly" is like a garbage truck, carrying away all the garbage, which purifies the democratic camp.

The symposium then entered another discussion center, "The Comparison of Two Forces." Professor Xiao Junying said: The CCP has abandoned some cities, but has thus gained the initiative in the war. It has stretched the Kuomintang army's front, revealing its lack of troops. Looking at the overall strength, the Kuomintang government's politics are corrupt and decadent, its economy is on the verge of collapse, and its military is lacking in morale and unable to replenish its troops. All of this is accelerating the decline of its strength and it will not be able to maintain its power. On the other hand, the CCP army, due to the political clarity and economic stability of the liberated areas, and its vigorous morale, will make its military strength stronger day by day. In addition, the growth of democratic forces in the Kuomintang areas, converging into a huge democratic torrent, can defeat the dictator's army. Mr. Huang Yaomian added that the Kuomintang army can only continue to fight with the help of the United States. American equipment will be largely given to the people's army. When the United States can no longer provide a continuous supply, that is when the Kuomintang will taste the bitterness. A Jiang army political worker who had just fled from Quzhou, Zhejiang, spoke at the meeting, saying that many political workers, who were considered the soul of the troops by the Kuomintang authorities, in the Quzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office jurisdiction, voluntarily ran to join the people's armed forces or fled back to their hometowns. This can be said to be a sign of the disintegration of the Kuomintang army. Finally, Liang Fangchen, the host of the symposium, summarized everyone's speeches and called on the people of the country to transform the conditions favorable to democracy into strength in order to achieve democratic victory.

    港九各界反内战大同盟
    发表声明反对伪“国大”
    人民团体代表座谈时事确信蒋军必败
    【新华社延安九日电】香港讯：此间港九各界反内战大同盟，曾于十一月十八日发表声明，反对国民党一党召开的非法“国民大会”，略称：“现在在南京召开的国民大会，是国民党政府违反政协决议而由一党包办召开的，正与民国十二年曹锟时代贿选总统一样，是历史上的一个丑剧。”接着二十日该同盟复邀集香港九龙各人民团体代表八十余人，假座六个饭店大礼堂举行时事座谈会。首请新自重庆抵此的萧隽英教授和作家黄药眠氏发言。萧氏称：“国大”的召开，是由于蒋孔宋陈四大家族有了二百万万美金的庞大财产，他们要用这个傀儡“国大”来使其不法的财产合法化。黄氏指出国民党当局声言邀请民主人士参加“国大”，但真正的民主人士决不会上当，凑成他的独裁宪法。作家吴华胥继起发言谓：“国大”好比是一辆垃圾车，载去所有的垃圾，倒是使民主阵营净化了。
    座谈会随即进入另一讨论中心“两种力量的对比”萧隽英教授说：中共放弃了一些城市，但由此却取得了战争的主动，它使国民党军的战线拉长了，显出其兵力不足。再从总的力量看，国民党政府政治贪污腐败，经济频于崩溃，军事上士无斗志，兵源无法补充，这一切使它的力量加速消减，而决不能保持其力量。另方面，中共军由于解放区的政治清明，经济稳定，士气旺盛，会使军力一天天强大，加上在国民党区的民主力量的成长，汇成民主的巨流，就可把独裁者的军队击溃。黄药眠氏补充说：国民党军队只有依靠美国帮助继续打下去，美式装备将大量丢给人民军队，到美国不能源源接济的时候，就是国民党尝到苦头的时候了。一位新从浙江衢州跑出来的蒋军政工人员在会上发言，他说：被国民党当局认为部队灵魂的政工人员，在衢州绥署辖区内，许多自动的跑去参加人民武装或逃回家乡。这可以说是国民党军队瓦解的征兆。最后由座谈会主持人梁芳尘氏总结大家的发言，号召国人把有利民主方面的条件转化为力量，以获得民主的胜利。
