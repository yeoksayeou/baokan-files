[This article describes the actions of Langzhai in taking care of the poor.]

(Our newspaper, Weixian, 13th) Langzhai in the Fifth District of En County, recognized the truth that all farmers are one family during the liberation movement, and took care of twenty-one hired laborers during the distribution of fruits of victory. The method was: if the hired laborer's family had already been allocated land, and they could maintain their livelihood without being a hired laborer, then they would no longer be allocated land, only movable property; if they lived in a poor village and could not solve the land problem, those who could settle in this village would be allocated land the same as the villagers according to the population; if they could not come to this village, they would be allocated four mu of land per person. After this method was announced, the hired laborers were all extremely happy. Four extremely poor hired laborers settled down in Langzhai, and the masses not only gave them land but also houses to live in. Two hired laborers whose families could not solve the land problem and who were unwilling to settle down were each given four mu of land. The hired laborers said gratefully: "Originally, I was embarrassed to ask for land, fearing that it would displease the villagers. Now everyone cares about me and solves my difficulties for me. I am truly grateful." The members of the farmers' association all said in unison: "All farmers are one family, there should be no distinction between this village and that village. We are all brothers through thick and thin. We welcome you to settle down here."

　　郎寨照顾贫村雇工  分给土地欢迎落户
    【本报威县十三日电】恩县五区郎寨，在翻身运动中认识了天下农民是一家的真理，分果实时对二十一名雇工都作了照顾。办法是如雇工家里已分到土地，不当雇工能维持生活者，即不再分给土地，只分浮财；如家住穷村不能解决土地问题，能来本村落户者与本村人一样的按人口分得土地，如不能来本村者，即按一人计算，分给四亩地。此办法发表后，雇工们无不高兴异常，有四个赤贫雇工，在郎寨落了户，群众不仅给土地，还分给房住，两个雇工家中不能解决土地问题，又不愿落户，每人分四亩地，雇工感激的说：“原来我不好意思说要地，恐惹村人不满意，现在大家关心我，给我解决困难，真感激不尽。”农会员都异口同声的说：“天下农民是一家，不应分本村外村，咱们都是生死弟兄，你们在这里按家落户，我们都很欢迎。”
