Xinhua News Agency, Central China, December 23rd: In the Huai'an-Baoying county area, surrounded by enemies, the armed cadres persisted in guerrilla warfare in the canal area and between Hongze and Baoying Lakes. In the past two months, they eliminated and captured 1,103 Chiang Kai-shek troops, security force, township team leaders, company commanders, township chiefs, and lower ranks. They themselves suffered only 12 casualties and successively captured strongholds such as Chahai, Huangji, Fanji, Huaji, and Luji. The Chiang troops are extremely panicked. The Huangji Chiang Brigade headquarters originally had 30 men, but all the members have deserted. The brigade commander, Chen Xiangsan, has been dismissed. The "Homecoming Corps" of Chiang's township offices in Nanwu, Baoji, and other places have all fled.

　　淮宝地区地方武装坚持游击
    两月来歼敌千余人
    攻克黄集岔海等据点多处
    【新华社华中二十三日电】四面受敌的淮（安）宝（应）县境运河及洪泽宝应两湖之间，干部武装坚持原地游击，两个月来共毙俘蒋军及保安区乡队连长中队长乡长以下一千一百零三人。自己仅伤亡十二人，并先后攻克岔海、黄集、范集、花集、陆集等据点，蒋军极度恐慌。黄集蒋大队部原有三十人，队员已全部开小差，大队长陈祥三被撤职，南武包集等蒋记乡公所“还乡团”均逃散一空。
