　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: During the battle to defend Ye Ting City, in the Biancang position, the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the New Fourth Army repelled eight assaults from two regiments of the 65th Division of the Chiang army with only one company. Initially, the Chiang army, relying on its American ammunition, bombarded our position indiscriminately with artillery fire. Our army adopted a tactic of "one shot, one kill," repelling them. At the Biancanggang River, one Chiang army squad charged to the bridgehead. Zhou Wen, the deputy squad leader of our Fourth Squad, shot two of them with two shots, driving the rest back. Later, the Chiang army attempted a sneak attack, but under the might of our machine guns, they didn't dare to even stick their heads out. Finally, driven by the Chiang army's督战队 (supervisory/motivational team), they launched another desperate charge. At that time, our various light and heavy weapons were already aimed, and a series of earth-shattering sounds annihilated the Chiang army one by one in the kill zone. In this battle, a total of 200 Chiang soldiers were killed, with each soldier in our company averaging two kills.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: During the battle to defend Ye Ting City (Yancheng), more than 40 militiamen from the Yandong District of the county cooperated with the main force near Biancang on the 8th, capturing more than 200 Chiang soldiers alive and seizing one Czech-style machine gun and more than ten rifles. In the battle of Dahezhuang, the local militia intercepted more than 80 Chiang army grain boats and killed four Chiang soldiers, including a deputy company commander. On the 9th, militiamen from the urban area seized one Canadian-style and one Thompson submachine gun each, ten Zhongzheng rifles, and six steel helmets near Biancang. The militiamen stroked the Thompson submachine guns excitedly and said, "The American arms factories are really good, and Chiang Kai-shek's transportation team isn't bad either!"

　　叶挺城保卫战中
    我军一连退敌两团
    民兵四十人擒蒋军二百余
    【新华社华中十六日电】蒋军进犯叶挺城途中，新四军某部九连在卞仓阵地曾以一个连击退蒋军六十五师两个团的八次冲锋。起先蒋军自恃有美国弹药，以炮火乱轰我阵地，我军即采取一枪打一个的办法，将其击退。在卞仓港河边，一次蒋军一个班已冲到桥边，我四班副周文两枪中两个，又把他们打回去。后来，蒋军偷偷摸来，但在我机枪威力下，连头也不敢伸出。最后由蒋军督战队逼着再一次拚命的冲锋，那时我各种轻重武器早已瞄准，一阵阵震天的响，把蒋军一一消灭在火力圈中。此次战斗共击毙蒋军二百，全连平均每人打死蒋军两名。
    【新华社华中十六日电】叶挺城（盐城）保卫战中，该县岩东区民兵四十余人，于八日协同主力在卞仓附近作战，活捉蒋军二百余，缴获捷克式机枪一挺，步枪十余支。在大荷庄战斗中，当地民兵截获蒋军粮船八十余只，击毙蒋军连副以下四名。城区民兵于九日在卞仓附近缴获蒋军加拿大式及汤姆式机枪各一挺，中正式步枪十支，钢盔六顶。民兵们抚摸着汤姆机枪兴奋的说：“美国兵工厂真顶好，蒋介石运输队也不坏！”
