　　A Tour of Shangguan Village
    Li Pu
    On the night of November 21st, a jeep sped us towards the front lines. The first thing we encountered was nearly two hundred Chiang Kai-shek army officers and non-commissioned officers, escorted by the world-renowned militia of the Liberated Areas. Most touching was the line of farmers carrying stretchers. The winter night in North China was particularly cold, and their heavy cotton-padded clothes made them appear especially strong.

    十一月二十一号的深夜，一辆小吉普车载着我们向战地急驰。最先遇到的是将近两百个蒋军中下级军官，押送他们的是举世闻名的解放区民兵。最动人的是抬担架的农民行列，华北的冬夜特别寒冷，厚重的棉衣把他们装扮得格外强劲。
