　　Junan Guerrilla Forces
    Help Peasants Fight Back Against Reversal of Land Reform
    [Report from this newspaper in the Ji-Lu-Yu region on the 29th] The Junan guerrilla forces, in conjunction with liberated peasants, are carrying out a movement against the reversal of land reform. The county's guerrilla forces recently arrived in Baolou and discovered that the village's Children's Corps leader had been buried alive by Chiang's troops. This was instigated by Chiang's agents, who stipulated that a denunciation by ten people was sufficient grounds for execution. A local despotic landlord colluded with ten people to tie him up and send him to the Chiang-controlled county government, where he was starved for seven days before being buried alive. From then on, the despotic landlord began to "reverse the land reform" in the village, taking back all the fruits of past struggles. In response to this situation, the guerrilla forces arrested these ten people and executed the two principal offenders who incited the "reversal" and were responsible for the murder. The remaining eight people were released on bail and made to agree to the following conditions with the masses: (1) All eight people must be responsible for the well-being of the murdered Children's Corps leader's mother, ensuring that nothing untoward happens to her. (2) Grain seized during the "reversal" must be returned in full. (3) Compensation must be paid to the families of the victims. When the guerrilla forces returned to the village a second time, all the grain seized during the "reversal" had been returned, the compensation grain had been paid, and the landlord had hosted the peasants as guests, leading to unity between the two sides. The children were once again singing songs in the streets in twos and threes. Villages within a radius of seven or eight *li* were afraid to "reverse the land reform." When the landlord of Niufanglou attempted to "reverse the land reform," the masses said "the peasant association is holding a meeting," which frightened the landlords so much that they dared not demand anything back, and the 1,000 *jin* of cotton seized during the reversal was also returned to the masses. After the "reversal" in Tanglou, district cadre Huang Keqin went back to find the landlord in the evening, and the ox that had been taken away during the "reversal" was immediately returned. The atmosphere of "reversal" in this area has been suppressed.

　　巨南游击队
    帮助农民反倒算
    【本报冀鲁豫廿九日电】巨南游击队结合翻身农民，开展反倒算运动。该县游击队于日前到鲍楼，发现该村儿童团长被蒋军活埋，此事系由蒋特发动，只要有十个人告就可杀头，该村某恶霸地主就一面联合十个人把他捆送到蒋记县府，饿了七天，最后活埋。从此恶霸地主在村里开始了“倒算”，把以前斗争的果实都夺回了。游击队据此种情形，就将这十个人逮捕起来，把两个杀害人命鼓动“倒算”的主犯枪毙，其余八个人取保释放，并由他们与群众订了条件：（１）对被害儿童团长母亲，八个人都得负责，不能发生意外。（２）“倒算”粮食一律退回。（３）抚恤被难家属。当游击队第二次到该村时，“倒算”粮食都退还了，抚恤粮也给了，地主请了农民的客，双方都团结了。儿童们在街里三三两两又唱起歌来。周围七八里地以内的村庄，都不敢“倒算”了。牛坊楼地主企图“倒算”，群众说“农会开会，”吓得地主们都不敢要了，倒算出的一千斤棉花也退给群众。汤楼“倒算”之后，区干部黄克钦晚上回去找地主，被“倒算”走的牛，立刻退了回来。这一带“倒算”空气被压下去了。
