    Frontline Soldiers Send Letters of Thanks for慰问, Determined to Report Victory to the Elders of Their Hometowns
    [Our Frontline Reporters' Corps Dispatch from the 11th] After receiving慰问品 from millions of people, commanders and soldiers of a certain unit on the frontlines have been sending letters of thanks and excitedly reporting news of their victories to the elders of their hometowns. The reporter saw no fewer than 109 letters in one place alone. The unit's leader wrote a letter of over three thousand words to the people in the rear and all the military dependents, recounting the glorious achievements of the unit in various battles and the firm belief of all officers and soldiers in annihilating the Chiang bandits and defending peace and democracy. Shi Yaojun, a 17-year-old communications soldier in a certain battalion, was wounded in the Battle of Huaxian. Before his wounds had healed, he volunteered, along with Deputy Company Commander Zhang Cunli and 23 others, to capture alive 12 American-equipped Chiang soldiers in Xiong Village, Puyang County. His father wrote to him, asking him to return home to get married, and he wrote back, saying, "It's not that I don't want to go back to get married now, it's that the traitor Chiang Kai-shek won't let me go back to get married." Soldier Wu Fushen wrote to his uncle, saying, "I have learned to be brave in battle. I have participated in two assault groups and achieved very good results, and I have been praised by the leader." Xu Baozhen's son wrote to the village cadre of his village, saying, "You work hard and lead the masses well at home; I will win more battles at the front." Xiao, a cadre in the regimental political department, wrote to his mother, saying, "During the mass movement, I heard that you automatically donated more than ten mu of land to the poor masses, and I was very happy to hear that. I hope to always stand with the masses." Soldier Song Ruling was slashed on the neck by a Japanese devil during the War of Resistance, and still bears the scar. When he saw the慰问團 representative—his fellow villager Song Huailing—he said, "The leader saw that my wound hasn't healed and asked me to go to the rear for recuperation, but I firmly refuse to go. I will definitely recuperate after I beat back the Chiang bandits' offensive." He asked Song Huailing to bring a message to his family. The soldiers discussed among themselves, "Everything at home is taken care of by the people in the rear, so we should just concentrate on doing our job at the front." (Ding Man)
