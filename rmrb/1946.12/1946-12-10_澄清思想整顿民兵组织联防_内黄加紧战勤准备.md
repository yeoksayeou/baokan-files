　　【This dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, dated the 8th】Neihuang is urgently preparing for war, reorganizing war support work, purging confused thinking among cadres and the masses, reorganizing and reviewing the militia, and preparing to launch guerrilla warfare. Large meetings are being held everywhere in districts and villages, along with parades and demonstrations. At a mass meeting in Weiliuhe on the 22nd of last month, the current situation was explained. When it was mentioned that Chiang Kai-shek wanted to attack Neihuang, it aroused the anger of the entire audience. Wu Laobao, who is sixty years old, said, "Don't think I'm old, I'll fight Chiang Kai-shek even if it costs me my life. Killing one is enough, killing two is a bonus." Lian Anjiao, who had just returned from a business trip from the front, happily talked about the victory news, and said, "I'll polish my red-tasseled spear when I get home, it's Chiang's army's nemesis." The vice-chairman of the Women's Federation said, "When the time comes, we women will guarantee to cook and boil water for our soldiers." Finally, it was decided to strengthen sentry duty and vigilance, prevent sabotage by special agents, and implement a scorched earth policy so that the enemy could not find anything when they came. The Fifth District has already organized joint defense, and the self-defense teams in villages such as Chaizhuang and Weiliuhe in the Second District sleep together at night and study military affairs. Recently, more than a thousand young people in the county have joined the regular army, and now young people are enthusiastically joining the district teams.

　　澄清思想整顿民兵组织联防
    内黄加紧战勤准备
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】内黄紧急备战，整理战勤工作，清洗干部及群众中的混乱思想，整理审查民兵，准备开展游击战争，各区村到处开大会，游行示威。上月二十二日魏流河的群众大会上，讲解目前时局，当谈到老蒋想进攻内黄时，激起全场群众的愤怒，六十岁的武老包说：“别看我老了，老蒋来了也得给他拚。打死一个够本，打死两个赚一个”。连安焦刚从前方出差回来很高兴的谈着胜利消息，并说：“回家把我的红缨枪擦亮，就是蒋军的对头兵”。妇女副会长说：“到时候俺妇女保证给咱们战士做饭烧水。”最后决定加强站岗放哨，防止特务破坏，实行空舍清野，使敌人来了找不到一点东西。五区已组织了联防，二区柴庄魏流河等村自卫队晚上集体睡觉，并学习军事。日前全县已有千余青壮年参加正规军，现青壮年又踊跃参加区队。
