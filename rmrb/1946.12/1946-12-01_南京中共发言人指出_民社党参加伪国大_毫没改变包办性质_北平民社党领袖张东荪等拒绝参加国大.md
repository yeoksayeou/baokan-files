　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 28th: Nanjing dispatch: On the 25th, the CCP spokesperson commented on the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly, stating: "Regarding the Democratic Socialist Party submitting a list to the 'National Assembly', we believe that no matter how they say in their exchange of documents with the government that they want to thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, in reality, they are helping the Kuomintang authorities to whitewash their actions of thoroughly undermining the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Their participation in the 'National Assembly' does not change the nature of the Kuomintang's one-party monopoly of the 'National Assembly' in the slightest."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 28th: Beiping dispatch: Zhang Dongsun, Hu Haimen, and Liang Qiushui, important leaders of the Democratic Socialist Party in Beiping, have all refused to participate in the split "National Assembly." Sun Baogang, a standing committee member of the party dispatched by Zhang Junmai to Beiping to discuss the issue of "participating in the National Assembly," left Beiping for Nanjing on the 24th, and he also expressed his refusal to participate in the "National Assembly." Zhang Dongsun also refused Chiang Kai-shek's invitation to attend the "National Assembly." Furthermore, according to various newspapers, Tang Xiangming and others who supported participation in the "National Assembly" within the Democratic Socialist Party contributed a lot of effort. Tang served as the director of the "North China Cooperation General Society" and other puppet positions during the enemy and puppet era.

　　南京中共发言人指出
  　民社党参加伪国大
    毫没改变包办性质
  　北平民社党领袖张东荪等拒绝参加国大
    【新华社延安十一月廿八日电】南京讯：廿五日中共发言人评民主社会党参加国大称：“关于民社党提交‘国大’名单一事，我们认为不管他们在与政府交换文件中怎样说要彻底实现政协决议，实际上却是帮助国民党当局对其彻底破坏政协决议之行为加以粉饰，他们之参加‘国大’，丝毫没有改变国民党一党包办‘国大’的性质”。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】北平讯：民社党北平方面重要负责人张东荪、胡海门、梁秋水均拒绝参加分裂的“国人”，由张君劢派遣赴平磋商“参加国大”问题之该党常委孙宝刚已于二十四日离平返京，渠亦表示不参加“国大”。张东荪对蒋介石之邀请出席“国大”亦予拒绝。又据各报透露，此次民社党中支持参加“国大”者汤芗铭等出力甚多，汤在敌伪时代曾任“华北合作总社”理事长及其他伪职。
