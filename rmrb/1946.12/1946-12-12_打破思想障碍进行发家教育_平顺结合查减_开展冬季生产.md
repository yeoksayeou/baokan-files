(Reported by this newspaper) Ping順 (Ping Shun County) has decided to combine rent reduction with a winter production campaign surpassing any previous year. Focusing on textiles and transportation, and based on the specific conditions of each locality, we will do what we can do best and whatever is profitable, ensuring that every village, household, and individual participates in winter production to lay the material foundation for the counter-offensive in the war of self-defense. It is required that at least one-half of the county's existing 22,000 female textile workers learn to weave this winter, and that two-thirds of the remaining 10,000 semi-able-bodied women learn to spin cotton. In this way, each person spinning two liang (approx. 71 grams) of cotton per day, and each loom weaving four chi (approx. 1.3 meters) of cloth per day, we can weave 100,500 zhang (approx. 33,500 meters) of cloth in three months, which is enough for the entire county to change into winter clothing. In addition to the general requirement that all villages universally develop textiles, villages with a foundation should pay attention to improving technology, improving tools, and developing Wang Sijie-style textile small-scale cooperatives (capital and labor are both contributed, and profits are distributed according to work points based on skill level, quality, speed). In terms of transportation, due to the war, the main transportation line relies on the Handan-Changzhi road, so it is especially important to grasp economic information to ensure that transportation does not lose money. One-third of the county's 21,000 able-bodied men should participate in transportation, and all 6,500 livestock should also participate, with each person earning a minimum of 5,000 yuan and each livestock earning 8,000 yuan. Transportation should be closely linked to textiles, buying back cotton and selling cloth; and it should be linked to other sideline occupations, purchasing tools and promoting finished products, etc. For other sideline production, each administrative village should have a sound cooperative, with a plan to organize carpenters and blacksmiths to manufacture cloth looms, spinning wheels, steel, iron chisels, etc., to develop small-scale handicrafts and gradually move towards industrialization. To increase fertilizer, the county currently has 1,200 pigs, and this number should be doubled during winter production. It is forbidden to kill ewes and lambs, and it must be guaranteed that sheep are not exported. In addition, each district should organize various small workshops according to specific conditions. In terms of agriculture, the main task in winter is to accumulate fertilizer and collect manure, requiring more manure collection, more bedding of livestock pens, roadside manure, and rice bran manure, etc., with both quality and quantity needing to be improved, laying the foundation for next year's large-scale production campaign. To ensure the completion of the above plan, it is necessary to first conduct education on wealth creation to break down various ideological obstacles to winter production. For example, some people passively wait to have deficiencies made up for them, some people become complacent after having land and houses as a result of "filling the holes," some people think that farmers should rest in the winter, some women think that their hands are cold in the winter and cannot spin cotton, etc., all of which should be addressed through education and overcome. In the investigation and rent reduction, we should organize the fruits of victory to be invested in production, paying special attention to supporting poor peasants who have turned over a new leaf to create wealth.

    打破思想障碍进行发家教育
    平顺结合查减
    开展冬季生产
    【本报讯】平顺决定结合查减开展超过以往任何一年的冬季生产运动。以纺织、运输为主，并根据各地具体条件，本能干啥干啥，啥有利益干啥的原则，作到村村、户户、人人都参加冬季生产，以奠定自卫战争反攻的物质基础，要求全县现有的二万二千纺妇中至少有二分之一在今冬学会织布，其余一万个半劳力妇女要有三分之二学会纺花。如此，则每人每天以纺花二两，每架机每天织四尺布计，三月内可织成十万零五千丈布，即足够全县换季。除一般村要求普遍开展纺织外，有基础的村子要注意提高技术，改良工具，发展王四姐纺织小型合作社（资本劳力都加入，按好、坏、快、慢把式折工分红）。运输方面，因战争关系主要运输线靠邯长路，因而特别要掌握经济情报，使运输不致赔钱。全县二万一千多个男全劳力要有三分之一参加运输，六千五百头牲口亦需全部参加，每人最低要赚洋五千元，每头牲口要赚洋八千元。运输要密切结合纺织，买回棉花，推销布匹；并要结合其他副业，购置工具及推销成品等。其他副业生产，每个行政村需有一健全的合作社，有计划的组织木、铁匠，制造布机、纺车、钢、铁铮等，开展小手工业并逐渐走向工业化，为增加肥料全县现有千二百只猪，冬季生产中要增加二倍。禁杀母羊、羊羔，并需保证羊不出口。此外，各区根据具体条件组织各种小型作坊。农业方面，冬季主要是积肥拾粪，要求多拾粪，多垫圈，造路粪及油糠粪等，质、量均需提高，为明年大生产运动打下基础。为保证上述计划完成，需首先进行发家教育，以打破冬季生产的各种思想障碍。如有的人消极等待填平补齐，有的人因“填窟窿”后有了地和房发生自满，有的人以为庄稼人到冬天就该休息，有的妇女以为冬天手冷不能纺花等等，都应注意教育克服。在查减中，应组织果实投入生产，特别注意扶助翻身贫苦农民生产发家。
