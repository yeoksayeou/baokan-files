[This report from our Taiyue Office on the 12th] The winter textile movement has been widely launched throughout the region. Farmers are well-fed and clothed. Especially in areas with a solid foundation in textiles, such as Shimin and Yangcheng, in addition to providing clothing for themselves, they are also exporting to other areas. The Huojia Mountain Cooperative in Shimin led the women of the entire village in textile production during the famine years, overcoming the famine and laying the foundation for textile production. This year, the entire village planted 465 mu of cotton, harvesting 7,000 jin of raw cotton. Two hundred and eighty-three textile women have woven 680 bolts of cloth from autumn to the present. Every family has new cotton clothes, and they plan to export the cloth woven in the future. According to the women leading textile production in the village, it is estimated that 2,000 bolts of cloth can be sold by the end of the year. The second district of Qinshui is a mountainous area with a cold climate, unsuitable for planting cotton. Farmers have enough food, but the problem of clothing cannot be solved. The masses in Beizhuang Village are fully organized in winter. Men transport coal to other places to buy back cotton, and women weave at home. From November 11th to the 29th, in one month, they transported and exchanged 1,242 jin of cotton. Based on the entire village of 489 people, large and small, each person can weave cloth with 2.9 jin of cotton, which can be used for the seasonal change next summer. The textile movement in Yangcheng is even more enthusiastic because they have greatly benefited from textile production. For example, Huo Qiuping, a woman from Beiliu Village, was poor and her clothes were tattered. She was determined to rely on textile production for clothing. After autumn, she went to the textile factory to learn with two liang of cotton. In three months of revolving textile production, she wove four bolts of cloth. Both husband and wife put on brand new cotton clothes, both inside and out, and a quilt. They also purchased a weaving machine to continue textile production.

　　自种自纺结果
    士敏阳城土布输出
    【本报太岳十二日电】全区冬季纺织运动业己普遍展开，农民食饱衣暖，尤其在纺织有基础地区，如士敏，阳城等地，除均给穿衣外，并向外输出。士敏霍家山合作社，在灾荒年间，领导全村妇女纺织，渡过饥荒，打下了纺织基础。今年全村又种棉四百六十五亩，收净花七千斤，二百八十三个纺织妇女，秋后至现在已织成布六百八十匹，家家换上新棉衣，现计划将今后纺织的布向外输出。据该村领导纺织的妇女估计，年底可出售二千匹布。沁水二区为山岳地区，气候寒冷，不宜植棉，农民粮食足够食用，但穿衣问题无法解决，北庄村群众冬季全部组织起来，男人向外运煤购回棉花，妇女在家纺织，自十一月三日至二十九日一月内，往返运输换回棉花一千二百四十二斤，按全村大小四百八十九人，每人以二斤九两棉花织成布，可供明夏换季之用。阳城纺织运动更加热烈，因为在纺织中得到大利。如北留村妇女霍秋平，家境贫寒，衣被破烂不堪，决心靠纺织穿衣，秋后以二两棉花到纺织厂学习，三个月中周转纺织，织成四匹布，夫妇都换上表里崭新的棉衣与一条被子，又购买了一架织布机，继续纺织。
