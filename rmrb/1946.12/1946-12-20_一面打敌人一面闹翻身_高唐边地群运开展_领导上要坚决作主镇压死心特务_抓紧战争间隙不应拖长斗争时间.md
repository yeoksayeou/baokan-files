(Our newspaper's telegram from Weixian, 17th) The masses in the border areas of Gaotang, under the slogan of "Take up guns to fight the enemy and carry out emancipation," have launched an emancipation movement. Xixu Guantun took the lead in establishing a joint defense team, repelling an enemy attack, and making the masses realize that only by first organizing armed struggle can they protect the emancipation movement. In the struggle, they adopted the organizational form of armed work teams, with cadres being armed and lightly equipped, fighting the enemy with guns while leading the masses in emancipation. Leading the militia to fight guerrilla warfare and organizing the masses to transfer, Xixu Guantun did the best in this regard. The organized masses not only suffered less losses, but also trained the militia and activists in guerrilla warfare, and enhanced their fighting spirit. However, Dongtun did not pay enough attention to this issue, resulting in two militiamen being disarmed and activists being arrested, and the work not recovering for a long time. Recently, they seized the opportunity of the war gap, quickly concentrated cadres, seized the base points, and boldly mobilized the masses; at the same time, they must also raise their vigilance and be ready to crush the attacks of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet bandits. Experience has proved that once the masses are mobilized, the fight should be quick and decisive, and the struggle time should not be prolonged. In Nitang Village, the struggle against Chen Jifen (a lackey of the traitorous Pang Changshen) was dragged on for too long, and the enthusiasm of the masses cooled down. During the anti-Pang meeting, when dividing Pang Changshen's land, some villages were vying for it, but the cadres did not seize the opportunity to distribute the land, and after the environment became tense, the masses dared not take the land. After Zhifangtou distributed the fruits of the struggle, the masses said: "As long as the government makes the decision for us, we dare to fight." Experience has proved that hardcore spies must be resolutely suppressed to clear the obstacles to mobilizing the masses, and the sabotage conspiracies of special agents must be exposed everywhere, and patriotic education must be widely carried out among the masses, and the slogan of "Cannot be intimidated, cannot be bought" must be put forward to strengthen the will of the masses. Experience has proved that the encroachment of small groups of enemies is a characteristic of the border areas. Cadres must adopt an alert and proactive offensive spirit, live with the militia, be brave and decisive, protect the masses' emancipation, and ensure that the front fights, the rear mobilizes the masses, fights the enemy at night, and carries out emancipation during the day. (Note that Gaotang's Fourth District is often harassed by Chiang Kai-shek puppet bandit gangs).

　　一面打敌人一面闹翻身
    高唐边地群运开展
    领导上要坚决作主镇压死心特务
    抓紧战争间隙不应拖长斗争时间
    【本报威县十七日电】高唐边沿区群众，在“拿起枪来打敌人闹翻身”的口号下，掀起了翻身运动。西徐官屯首先建立了联防队，打退了敌人的一次袭击，使群众认清了只有首先组织武装斗争，才能保卫翻身运动。在斗争中，他们采用了武工队的组织形式，干部武装化、轻装化，一面拿枪打敌人，一面领导群众闹翻身。带领民兵打游击，组织群众转移，西徐官屯在这点上作的最好。有组织的群众不但受的损失小，在游击中还锻炼了民兵与积极分子，提高了斗志。但东屯对这个问题注意的不够，以致两个民兵被缴械，积极分子被逮捕，工作很长时间没恢复起来。最近他们抓紧战争空隙时机，迅速集中干部，抓住基点，大胆放手发动群众；同时又须要提高警惕性，随时准备粉碎蒋伪匪进攻。经验证明，群众发动起来，应速战速决，不要使斗争时间拖长。倪堂村斗争陈继芬（庞逆长申之狗腿）拖的时间太长，群众热气凉下去。反庞大会，分庞长申的土地时，有的村争着要，但干部未抓紧分配土地，环境紧张后。群众便不敢要地了。纸坊头分配了斗争果实，群众说：“只要政府给咱做主，咱就敢斗”。经验证明，对死心特务要坚决镇压，以扫清发动群众的障碍，并到处揭发特务分子的破坏阴谋，在群众中广泛进行气节教育，并提出“吓不倒、买不动”的口号，以坚定群众意志。经验证明，小股敌人的蚕食是边沿区的特点，干部必须采取机警主动进攻精神，与民兵生活在一起，英勇果敢，保卫群众翻身，作到前方战斗，后方发动群众，晚上打敌人，白天闹翻身。（按高唐四区经常受蒋伪匪团的袭扰）。
