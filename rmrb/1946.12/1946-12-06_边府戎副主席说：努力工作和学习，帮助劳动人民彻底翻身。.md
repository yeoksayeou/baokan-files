　　Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Government Says:
　　Work and study hard to help the laboring people thoroughly liberate themselves.
　　Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Government called on everyone to do two things to celebrate Commander-in-Chief Zhu's birthday: work hard and study hard. In working hard, the first thing to do is to thoroughly implement "land to the tiller" and implement filling in gaps and leveling differences. He said, "Commander-in-Chief Zhu is the leader of the Chinese laboring people. Only when we help the laboring people to liberate themselves will the Commander-in-Chief feel most happy." Secondly, Vice Chairman Rong pointed out: it is necessary to launch autumn production and prepare for next year's great production campaign, and fully support the front lines in order to win the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. When talking about studying, he said, "We must learn from Commander-in-Chief Zhu's heroic struggle, hard struggle, and spirit of unity and love."
　　Vice Chairman Xing of the Border Region Assembly said, "Commander-in-Chief Zhu is the leader of the Chinese revolution and the savior of the Chinese people. Without him, there would be no liberated areas, no Eighth Route Army, and no New Fourth Army. We relied on him, defeated Japanese imperialism, resisted Chiang Kai-shek's attacks, and defended our peaceful and happy life. The liberation of the Chinese nation will surely be victorious under the leadership of Chairman Mao and him. I wish Commander-in-Chief a long life."
　　Kong Congzhou, Commander of the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, personally led a regiment of soldiers from afar today to celebrate the Commander-in-Chief's birthday. He asked everyone, "Today, the people in the liberated areas are all getting fat and warm. Who gave this to us?" He said, "This was all given to us by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Now Chiang Kai-shek is here to overturn our rice bowls. He wants us to freeze to death and starve to death. We can only fight him to the end under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. We will definitely be able to eat our fill and keep warm forever." Finally, Commander Kong condemned the "National Assembly" single-handedly organized by Chiang Kai-shek, saying, "The illegal National Assembly convened by Chiang Kai-shek has become his own memorial service. All his ugly tricks have long been exposed by the people at home and abroad, but Chiang Kai-shek still doesn't know that his grave is waiting for him?"
　　Finally, People's Representative Sun, the district head, and Hao Wuzi, the militia representative, both spoke, expressing that all liberated peasants are determined to thoroughly liberate themselves under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, actively support the front lines, and strive for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. The meeting adjourned at 4 p.m.

　　边府戎副主席说：
  　努力工作和学习，帮助劳动人民彻底翻身。
    边府戎副主席，号召大家作好两件事情，给朱总司令祝寿，这就是努力工作与努力学习。在努力工作中，首先要彻底贯彻耕者有其田，实行填平补齐。他说：“朱总司令是中国劳动人民的领袖，我们只有帮助劳动人民翻了身，总司令才会感到是最欢喜的”。其次戎副主席指出：要展开秋季生产与准备明年大生产运动，全力支援前线，以争取爱国自卫战争的胜利。讲到学习时他说：“我们要学习朱总司令的英勇奋斗、艰苦奋斗、团结爱人的作风。”
    边区参议会邢副议长说：“朱总司令是中国革命的领袖，是中国人民的救星，没有他，就没有解放区、没有八路军、新四军。我们依靠了他，打败了日本帝国主义，抵抗了蒋介石的进攻，保卫了和平幸福的生活，中华民族的解放在毛主席和他的领导下一定会胜利的，祝总司令万寿无疆。”
    西北民主联军三十八军孔从周军长，今天亲率一团士兵从远道赶来给总司令祝寿，他向大家发问道：“今天解放区人民，都吃胖了，穿暖了，这是谁给的？”他说：“这都是毛主席朱总司令给的，现在蒋介石来倒我们的饭碗，他要我们冻死饿死，我们只有在毛主席朱总司令的领导下，同他拚到底，我们一定能够永远的吃得饱，穿得暖”。最后孔军长谴责蒋介石一手包办的“国大”说：“蒋介石召开的非法国大，已经成了他自己的追悼大会，他的一切丑把戏早为国内外人民揭穿了，可是蒋介石却还不知道他的坟墓正等待着他呢？”
    最后，人民代表孙区长，民兵代表郝武子，都讲了话，表示全体翻身农民，誓在毛主席朱总司令领导下，翻身到底，踊跃支援前线，争取爱国自卫战争的胜利，大会至下午四时始散。
