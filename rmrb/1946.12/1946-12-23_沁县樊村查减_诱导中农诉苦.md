[Reported from Taiyue on the 19th of this month] Qin County's Fancun discovered during land investigation and rent reduction that middle peasants were still outside the struggle. Although a large number of middle peasants participated in the anti-traitor liquidation meeting, most were completely perfunctory and observing. When someone asked what problems the middle peasants had, they replied, "We are here to help others!" In fact, Fancun has experienced brutal levies by the enemy and puppets, and the vast majority of middle peasants have suffered disasters and have many grievances. Later, under the ideological guidance of cadres, the middle peasants of the whole village poured out their grievances, forming a middle peasant grievance meeting. For example, Shi Erhe said, "I heard people say that accounting should be done nine times, and I thought it would be our turn after only three times, so why would I want to participate in the struggle? Now, in retrospect, it is really suspicious." Shi Eryou said, "In the past, I opposed the exploitation of feudal landlords just like poor peasants, but my mind was not clear. This delayed my liberation in the Great Liquidation Movement, and now I can't hesitate any longer. I have rented landlord Wu Gui's land for twenty years, paying four dou of rent per mu. This year, I still have to carry water and haul coal for him. Wu Gui has to pay ten workdays at the Wu family ancestral hall for his birthday. I work hard all year and cannot eat enough or wear warm clothes." Wang Penglai recalled that his father was forced to death by the landlord for grain. Now is the time to turn over and take revenge. Why am I still hesitating? He burst into tears in anger. Then dozens of middle peasants, including Wen Shuihe, Wen Laixing, Wen Fuhe, Wen Shuizhi, and Wen Shuisheng, demanded to turn over. The whole village is now brewing to organize all the peasants to hold a large-scale grievance, revenge, and liberation conference.

　　沁县樊村查减
    诱导中农诉苦
    【本报太岳十九日电】沁县樊村在查减中发现中农还在斗争圈外。反奸清算大会上虽有大部中农参加，但多系完全是应付与观望，有人问到中农有什么问题，答：“咱是帮助别人来了！”实际上樊村历经敌伪横征暴敛，绝大部分中农遭受浩劫他们也有许多苦。后在干部思想诱导下，全村中农倾倒苦水，形成一个中农诉苦会议，如史二和说：“咱听人说算账要算九次，想着用不着三次就轮到咱中农头上了，因此咱想参加斗争干什么？现在检讨起来，实在是多疑。”史二有说：“咱过去与贫农一样的反对封建地主的剥削，只是脑筋未通，这在大清算运动中误了翻身，现在再不能犹豫了。我租种地主吴贵二十年的地，每亩出过四斗租子，今年还给人家担水、拉煤，吴贵过生日还得在吴家祠堂支十个工，劳动一年吃不饱、穿不暖。”王蓬来想起父亲曾被地主要粮逼死，现在正是翻身复仇的机会，为什么自己还犹豫不决呢？激愤中落下泪来。接着便有温水和、温来兴、温富和、温水志、温水生等数十个中农要求翻身，现全村正酝酿组织全体农民，开大规模的诉苦复仇翻身大会。
