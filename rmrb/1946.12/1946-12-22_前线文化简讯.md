　　Frontline Culture Briefs
　　The Performing Arts Troupe is Busy Rehearsing Plays
　　The Art Group's Pens Never Stop

　　The Military Region Performing Arts Troupe recently joined forces with the × Department Performing Arts Team to create scripts and compose music. Rehearsals are extremely intense. The writing team is often modifying drafts late into the night, and the actors are reciting lines even in their sleep. Despite the freezing weather, the art group refuses to put down their numb painting brushes. According to the comrade in charge of the troupe: "All personnel consider it an unparalleled honor to serve the front lines. Our current work is more difficult and demanding than ever before, and our morale is also higher than ever before."

　　All the plays are based on the heroic and moving deeds from various battles, and have undergone thorough investigation, collective discussion, and repeated revisions. Plays that have already been successfully rehearsed include a "Song and Dance Drama," "Digging Fortifications," "Ode to the Hero Lü Dengke," the spoken drama "Zhangfeng Village," "Defending Dragon Village," the opera "Yu Xinke's Grievances," and "Drive Away the Red-Haired Devils." It is expected that all will be completed by the end of the year and will be performed for the various troops during the New Year. At that time, there will be more than 180 large and small cloth paintings, which will be exhibited in rotation.

　　The play "Digging Fortifications" is short and vivid, emphasizing that valor must be combined with skill; the solidity of fortifications has a significant impact on victory. When rehearsed, the officers and soldiers of the directly subordinate units competed to visit and observe, unanimously agreeing that the content was vivid and the educational significance was great.

　　"Fear and Bravery"
　　Deeply Welcomed by the Front Lines

　　"Fear and Bravery," a recently published Soviet literary masterpiece transported from the rear to the front lines, is deeply welcomed by the frontline cadres. A certain unit's commander said, "I finished reading it in one go, it's really good! Every cadre above platoon level should read it once. It is truly the best reference book for studying combat regulations." During morning exercises, he also gave a special introduction to it. When the leader of a certain unit heard about this book, he called the political department, urging them to send it. Because there were not enough copies of the book to distribute, Director Zhao of a certain unit specifically gathered cadres above platoon level to explain the stories in the book.

　　A Certain Unit's Commander
　　Often Takes Pictures of Soldiers

　　Comrade Ma, a commander of a certain unit, has a keen interest in photography and often takes pictures of soldiers on the battlefield. He said with a smile: "What a pity! What a pity! I didn't capture the moment of the charge! At that time, I was busy fighting, and I forgot to take pictures. By the time I remembered, it was too late!"

　　前线文化简讯
    文工团忙于排剧
    美术组笔不停挥
    军区文工团近与×部文工队联合创作剧本，配制歌谱，排演工作至为紧张，创作组常常深夜还在修改底稿，演员们梦呓中还在背诵台词。天寒结冰，美术组仍不肯放下冻僵了的画笔。据该团负责同志谈：“全体人员都以服务前线为无上光荣。目前工作比任何时期都艰苦繁重，而情绪也比任何时期高涨。”
    所有剧本均取材于各次战役中可歌可泣的英雄事迹，并经过深入调查、集体讨论、反复修改，现已排演成功者有“歌舞剧”，“挖工事”，“吕登科英雄颂”，话剧“张凤集”，“保卫龙＠集”，歌剧“于新科诉苦”及“赶走红毛鬼子”等。预计年底即可全部完成，将于新年分赴各部队献演，届时，将有大小布画一百八十余幅，轮回展览。
    “挖工事”一剧简短生动，强调英勇必须与技术结合；工事坚固与否，对胜利有重大影响。排演时，直属队指战员争往参观，一致认为内容生动，教育意义很大。
    “恐惧与无畏”
    深受前线的欢迎
    刚由后方运到前线最近出版的苏联文学名著“恐惧与无畏”，深受前线干部欢迎。某部指挥员同志说：“我一口气把他读完了，真好！排以上干部都要看一遍。真是学战斗条令最好的参考书。”早操讲话时，他还专门作了一次介绍，某部首长听说此书，打电话向政治部催着要。某部赵主任因为这书不敷分配，专门集合排以上干部，讲解这书里的故事。
    某部指挥员同志
    常给战士们照像
    某部指挥员马同志，对摄影兴趣甚浓，常在战地为战士摄影，他笑着说：“可惜！可惜！冲锋那一阵没有拍下来！那时候忙着打仗，忘了摄影，等到想起来又来不及了！”
