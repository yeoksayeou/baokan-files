　　[From our Jilu Yu Correspondent Group, 12th] Zhu Xiaochen, a local tyrant and landlord of Zhu Lou Village, Fifth District, Fan County, secretly colluded with the enemy and puppets to harm the people. He was sentenced to death by public trial by the masses. At the beginning of this month, comrades from the Military Region Civil Affairs Department noticed that the relationship between the masses in the village and the army was abnormal. After investigation, they discovered that although the village was an old liberated area where a democratic government was established at the beginning of the war against Japan, the despotic landlord Zhu Xiaochen was still oppressing the masses, and even rent and interest reductions had not been implemented. Therefore, it was decided to personally help the masses of the village to turn themselves over. After individual interviews and patient explanations, the poor masses began to pour out their grievances, revealing that Zhu Xiaochen had colluded with the traitor Xu Jixiang in 1932 to arrest the democratically elected village chief, sell public guns to the traitor, rob the military region's salt transport vehicles, forge tickets, and dig up public grain. During the Japanese "mopping-up" operations, he impersonated a puppet soldier and raped women. However, they still did not dare to struggle because they had sent the despot to the district and county six times in the past, and he was released every time. In response to this situation, comrades from the Civil Affairs Department continued to persuade and explain, expressing that the democratic government and the Eighth Route Army would definitely support the masses. At the same time, they went to discuss solutions with the district cadres. As a result, the courage and enthusiasm of the masses were finally mobilized. They automatically arrested Zhu Xiaochen in the dark of night, demanding an immediate struggle session, and said to the comrades of the Civil Affairs Department: "If Zhu Xiaochen is not overthrown, we will never be able to turn ourselves over. If Zhu Xiaochen is released again, we will not be able to live." Thus, a struggle meeting was convened. At the meeting, the director of the district federation first reviewed the past work as not being thorough enough, being blinded by the despot, not understanding the suffering of the masses, and not actively supporting the masses, and expressed his determination to correct past mistakes, even if Chiang's troops came, he would never leave everyone. At this point, the masses who filled the meeting hall spoke up one after another. Zhu Xiaoying's mother, with tears streaming down her face, pointed at Zhu Xiaochen and cursed: "My good family was ruined by you. You seized my daughter-in-law and kept her in your house for eighteen days. My son was angered and ran away. My daughter-in-law was in pain and anger when she came out, and finally died of illness! The old man is sick and unable to move, leaving only me, an old woman, unable to die and unable to live. You have harmed me so much!" As she spoke, she sobbed uncontrollably, and everyone in the audience was moved to tears. Mr. Wang, a seventy-year-old man with a white beard, was hemiplegic. He walked to the chairman's table with a cane, step by step, and said with tears in his eyes: "Zhu Xiaochen killed my son-in-law and oppressed me so that I cannot live. I want everyone to decide for me." Then a woman in her thirties walked out and said: "Because my man didn't sell you a rickshaw, you killed him, leaving behind a son and two daughters, making it impossible for us to live. Zhu Xiaochen, do you have any conscience?" As she spoke, tears streamed down her face. Almost all the women in Zhu Lou were raped by Zhu Xiaochen, and even his second aunt was not spared. The masses unanimously demanded that Zhu Xiaochen be shot immediately. Secretary Shi of the county government and a special officer of the Judicial Section came to conduct a public trial. According to the opinions of the masses, Zhu Xiaochen was executed by firing squad.

　　老区朱楼至今未减租
    军区民运部协同地方，发动群众铲除奸霸朱孝臣。
    【本报冀鲁豫记者团十二日电】范县五区朱楼村恶霸地主朱孝臣，私通敌伪残害人民，经群众公审处死刑。本月初，军区民运部同志见该村群众对军队关系不正常，经调查结果，发现该村虽系抗战开始即建立了民主政权的老解放区，而恶霸地主朱孝臣仍在欺压群众，甚至减租减息均未实行。因此决定亲自帮助该村群众翻身。经个别访问及耐心解释后，贫苦群众始倾吐苦水，揭发朱孝臣在三十二年，勾结汉奸徐纪祥，抓走民选村长，把公枪卖给汉奸，劫军区的运盐车辆、架票、刨公粮，日本“扫荡”时冒充皇协军强奸妇女等罪行。但仍不敢斗争，因过去曾六次把该恶霸送区送县，每次都放回来了。针对此种情况，民运部同志，一面继续说服解释，表示民主政府和八路军一定要为群众撑腰；一面去与区干部共同研究办法。结果群众的勇气与热情终于发动起来了，他们自动在黑夜里把朱孝臣逮捕起来，要求立即开斗争会，并向民运部同志说：“斗不倒朱孝臣永远翻不了身，再放走朱孝臣咱们活不成。”于是就召开了斗争大会，会上区联合会主任，首先检讨过去工作不深入，受恶霸蒙蔽，不了解群众痛苦，没有积极为群众撑腰，并表示决心改正过去错误，即使蒋军过来，也决不离开大家。至此挤满会场的群众，乃纷纷争先发言。朱孝英母亲老泪横流，指着朱孝臣骂道：“我好好的一家，被你霸了我媳妇，窝在你家里十八天，把我儿子气跑了，媳妇出来又痛苦又气愤，终于病死了！老汉病到现在不能动，只剩我一个干老婆子，死不能死，活不能活，你害的我好苦啊！”说着泣不成声，全场闻之，潜然下泪。七十余岁的白胡子王老先生，半身不遂了，手扶拐杖，一步一拐的走到主席案子跟前，流着泪说：“朱孝臣害死我女婿，压迫的我不能活，要大家作主。”接着走出一个三十余岁的女人说：“我男人因一辆洋车子没卖给你，你就害死了我男人，丢下一个小子两个闺女，使我们没法活，朱孝臣你还有良心吗？”说着泪如雨下。朱楼妇女被朱孝臣奸污殆尽，甚至其二婶子亦未幸免。群众一致要求马上枪决朱孝臣，县府石秘书及司法科特来公审，按照群众意见，将朱孝臣执行枪决。
