　　Ningnan Dongwang Town
    Winter School Opens
    [This newspaper's Weixian dispatch, 1st] After the masses in Ningnan Dongwang Town achieved liberation and turned themselves around, they established a winter school to enhance their understanding and manage their own civil affairs. The peasants of this village said at the reflection meeting after their liberation and victory: "In the past, schools were run for the landlords, and the poor couldn't afford to attend, so we became blind men with open eyes; now that we are in charge, we must also establish schools to improve our abilities." So everyone decided to establish a winter school. The Farmers' Association, Women's Association, and Militia were formed into five large groups, and classes were held in the evenings and afternoons. The teachers of each group were active members with correct ideology and enthusiastic service to the masses. At the same time, a one-month curriculum was stipulated: 1. What is a special agent? How to prevent them? Recognize and defeat their sabotage activities; 2. Farmers' Association members swear an oath; 3. Support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers and martyrs; 4. Poor and middle peasants are one family; 5. Compare (Chairman Mao compares to Chiang Kai-shek, the Communist Party compares to the Kuomintang, the Eighth Route Army compares to the Central Army, the democratic government compares to the autocratic government). 6. The three towns of Dongwang are one family, and the poor people of the world are of one heart. 7. How do we implement democracy? 8. How can individuals serve the masses? 9. Oppose extravagant eating and drinking, actively engage in production, and become prosperous; 10. How to defend the fruits of victory? Each of the above items is studied for three days, and the learning method is democratic discussion, followed by a conclusion by the teacher. After the establishment of the winter school, the enthusiasm of the masses was extremely high. In three days, illiterate women were able to recognize and write their own names, the name of the village, and "Chairman Mao." Li Zhuanzi, who was over forty years old, carried a small slate with him and wrote wherever he went.

　　宁南东汪镇
    冬学开课
    【本报威县一日电】宁南东汪镇群众于翻身胜利后，为增强认识，治理自己民政，建立了冬学。该村农民在翻身胜利的反省会上说：“以前学校是给地主们办的，穷人上不起，咱们都成了睁眼的瞎子；这时咱们当了家，也要设立学校，提高咱们的能力。”于是大家决定建立冬学。农会、妇会、民兵编为五个大组，分别在晚上下午上课，各组教员由思想正确、热心为群众服务的积极分子担任。同时又规定了一个月的课程：一，什么是特务？怎样防止？认识与打垮他们的破坏活动；二，农会员宣誓；三，拥军优抗；四，贫中农是一家；五，比一比（毛主席比蒋介石，共产党比国民党，八路军比中央军，民主政府比专制政府。）六，东汪三镇是一家，天下穷人一条心。七，大家如何实行民主？八，个人怎样给群众服务？九，反对大吃大喝，要积极生产，发家致富；十，如何保卫胜利果实？以上每一项都学习三天，学习方式采用民主讨论，然后再由教员作结论。冬学成立后，群众热情极高。三天的工夫，不认字的妇女们，都能认写自己的姓名、村名、和“毛主席”，四十多岁的李转子身带小石板，走到那里写到那里。
