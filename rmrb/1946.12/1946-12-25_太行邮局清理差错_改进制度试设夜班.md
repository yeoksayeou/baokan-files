　　Taihang Post Office Cleans Up Errors
    Improves System, and Tries Night Shifts
    [Another Dispatch] The Taihang Postal Administration has recently been adjusting its trunk lines to increase delivery speed. It is also piloting night shifts on the Suobao to Shexian section, which has sped up delivery by one day compared to before. Currently, there are plans to add night shifts to certain trunk lines to further accelerate mail delivery. In addition, to rectify past errors and ensure rapid and accurate postal delivery in the future, as well as to address the current chaotic postal situation, a decision has been made to enforce strict discipline, strengthen employee education, and implement a reward and punishment system. Inspectors from the Bureau are now separately investigating postal errors in various locations to rectify them. The Postal Affairs Section is improving technical systems based on the causes of errors. To prevent mail from being rubbed and lost, all mail will be sealed in mailbags for transport in the future. The Accounting and Statistics Section is currently rushing to make mail packages, adjust mailbags, and purchase relevant postal tools to ensure the implementation of this system.
