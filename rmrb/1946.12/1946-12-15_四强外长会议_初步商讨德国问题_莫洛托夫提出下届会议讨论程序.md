Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 11th: New York – After the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference concluded discussions on the five-nation peace treaties, it began discussing the German question. At the meeting on the 7th, Molotov suggested that the current meeting should consider the agenda for the next Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the German question, and that the next meeting should be dedicated to discussing the German question and preparing the peace treaty with Austria. Molotov then proposed the agenda for discussing the German question. Bevin also proposed the agenda for the next meeting in his speech, but Bevin also suggested that the Foreign Ministers Conference immediately appoint special assistants to study the German question, listen to the opinions of smaller countries, and demand that the current meeting immediately discuss the reduction of Allied troops stationed in Germany and other European countries. Molotov criticized Bevin's suggestion, saying that it was putting the cart before the horse to have assistants study the German question before the Foreign Ministers Conference had even discussed it, as the assistants would not know what to do. As for the reduction of troops, special military representatives would need to participate in the discussion, but there were no such representatives present. The meeting ended without a result. The meeting was adjourned on the 8th because Bevin went to Washington to meet with Truman. On the morning of the 9th, Bevin met with Byrnes, followed by Molotov's visit to Byrnes. At the afternoon meeting, it was decided that the next Foreign Ministers Conference would be held in Moscow on March 10th next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 10th: According to news from New York: While the British, American, and Soviet powers were concluding discussions on the five-nation peace treaties at the Foreign Ministers Conference, they exchanged opinions separately. On the 9th, Molotov visited Byrnes for talks lasting an hour. The previous day (the 8th), Bevin arrived in Washington from New York and met with US President Truman. According to a British spokesperson: Bevin and Truman met in the White House for fifty minutes, covering a wide range of topics, and reached a general agreement on various broad issues. The spokesperson did not announce the content of the talks, but some observers in Washington estimated that the Palestine issue was one of them. Byrnes recently announced that the United States and Britain would discuss this issue.

    四强外长会议
    初步商讨德国问题
    莫洛托夫提出下届会议讨论程序
    【新华社延安十一日电】纽约讯：四强外长会议在五国和约讨论完毕后，已开始讨论德国问题。七日会议上，莫洛托夫认为目前会议应考虑下届外长会议讨论德国问题的程序，而下届会议则应专门讨论德国问题及准备对奥地利和约。莫氏继乃提出讨论德国问题的程序。贝纳斯发言时亦提出下届会议之程序，但贝氏又建议外长会议立即任命特别助理研究德国问题，并听取各小国意见，并要求本届会议立即讨论裁减盟国驻德及其他欧洲国家的军队。莫洛托夫批评贝氏建议称：外长会议还没有讨论德国问题便要助理来研究，实是始末颠倒，助理将不知道他们要做什么，至于裁减驻军须有特别军事代表参加才能讨论，目前则无此种代表。是日会议未有结果。八日因贝文赴华府与杜鲁门会谈而休会。九日上午，贝文与贝纳斯会谈，继之莫洛托夫亦访贝纳斯。下午会议时，决定下届外长会议在明年三月十日在莫斯科举行。
    【新华社延安十日电】据纽约讯：华府英美苏三强于外长会议结束对五国和约的讨论之余，分别交换意见。九日莫洛托夫往访贝纳斯会谈，达一小时。在此前一日（八日），贝文自纽约抵华府与美总统杜鲁门会谈。据英方发言人称：杜贝在白宫会谈五十分钟，范围无所不包，对各广泛问题已获一般协议。该发言人未宣布会谈内容，据华府若干观察家估计，巴勒斯坦问题成为其中之一，贝纳斯最近曾宣布英美将会谈此一问题。
