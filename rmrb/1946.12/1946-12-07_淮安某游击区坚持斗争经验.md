　　Experiences in Persistent Struggle in a Guerrilla Area of Huai'an
    Ju Min
    After the Chiang troops occupied Huai'an city, a certain district of Huai'an temporarily became a guerrilla area. The preliminary experiences of this district in persisting in struggle for the past half month are reported as follows:
    (1) It is necessary to dispel the doubts and concerns of cadres and the masses, and to inspire the people's morale in order to effectively transition to persistent struggle.
    When the district initially changed into a severe and difficult situation, some cadres and the masses lacked confidence in their thinking, but the cadres who had fought guerrillas during the Anti-Japanese War said: "We fought guerrillas everywhere in the past with strongholds everywhere, what are we afraid of! All we need is a gun." At that time, the masses urgently needed to know "Why did Lianghuai retreat?" "Will the New Fourth Army leave?" "What about the land?" "Is the government here?" "What should be done about bad people?" and other questions.
    At this time, the cadres used the spirit of gathering as many people as possible for meetings, large or small, going deep into the vicinity of strongholds at night, and holding meetings by village. When the environment permitted, larger meetings were held as much as possible. The township people's association in ×× townships was notified very late, but the gatherings were early, and some villages were not notified, but they were more organized than usual meetings. The meetings brought them the firm belief that "the New Fourth Army will definitely come back." The experience of mobilizing meetings in these two townships is: cadres go all out to mobilize separately, and responsible comrades from the county and district participate personally, explaining the reasons for the transfer of Lianghuai. They reiterate our army's operational policy, the conditions and methods for persisting in the struggle, and clearly put forward the slogans of defending land reform and armed mobilization. At the meeting, encouraged by the determination to defend themselves, the masses automatically went underground, killed chickens as a pledge, and the county and district cadres also participated in the oath of integrity. The district and township cadres expressed their determination to "live and die together," "never lose a gun even if we die," not to leave the district, not to leave the township, and to support the peasants' demands for "wanting and protecting land." Wartime covenants were drawn up and posted for public announcement. After several meetings, the masses excitedly said: "They are not leaving!" "There is hope!" Chen ××, a peasant who got land, gave no opportunity for the "village head" and landlords to be proud, expressing that "the Central Army" is standing on your land, only then does the land belong to you, otherwise, don't even think about it.
    (2) In the guerrilla environment, armed struggle should be combined with land re-investigation in order to implement and consolidate land reform. Only through this struggle can the superiority of the masses be truly established.
    Land reform in the district has undergone great changes in the changing situation, manifested in: (1) feudal despots attempting to restore power, and a small number of tenant farmers being threatened and not daring to take the land. (2) Some entering and exiting households "leave a way out," so some land yields are harvested together, and some are harvested by mutual concession, saying: "We'll talk about it later"; "If the New Fourth Army comes, it's mine, if the Central Army comes, it's yours"; "Whether the Central Army comes or not, the land is wanted, and the crops must be harvested," the village heads secretly maneuvering to collect rent. Therefore, the entire district began preparations and ideological brewing for reinvestigating the land, and the methods of carrying it out are:
    (1) The government issued orders and notices, announcing that "land has been distributed, and no secret rent is allowed to be paid to landlords, and no land is allowed to be returned or divided secretly," and mobilized through meetings.
    (2) Stabilize the thinking of the land-entering households in current affairs education, persuade the land-exiting households to look further ahead, and call on the land-exiting households who are enclosing land or privately cutting crops to "return grain and land," and convene another meeting of land-entering households to discuss how to implement land reform.
    (3) After the cadres' thinking is cleared, they first "self-investigate themselves" and then extend it to others, continuing the masses' struggle against those who undermine land reform.
    (4) Each township cultivates strong mass leaders to become the banner for leading the persistent struggle and the executive backbone for implementing land reform, while reforming cadres.
    (3) In all areas that may become marginal areas, long-term persistence should be planned early, and appropriate cadres should be re-equipped and armed forces established.
    This experience is very important. When a large number of outside cadres were temporarily evacuated from the district, the village cadres and masses should have been fully educated and mobilized ideologically in advance. Before the change of situation and after the conscription movement, district teams should have been established in a timely manner so that there would be a backbone organization for the armed forces of the entire district after the situation changed.

### 淮安某游击区坚持斗争经验

　　淮安某游击区坚持斗争经验
    居敏
    蒋军侵占淮安城后，淮安某区暂时成为游击区，兹将半个月来该区坚持斗争的初步经验报导如下：
    （一）必须解除干部群众的怀疑顾虑，要激励民气，才能有效的转入坚持斗争。
    该区刚开始改变为严重艰苦情况时，有些干部和群众思想上缺乏信心，但抗战中打过游击的干部则说：“过去到处是据点还打游击，怕什么！只要一支枪就行”。而当时群众又迫切需要知道“两淮为什么撤退”？“新四军走不走”？“田地怎么办”？“政府是不是在此地”？“对坏人怎么办”？等问题。
    这时干部用来多少人开多大会，到多少是多少，到了就开会的精神，夜晚深入据点附近，按庄按村开会。环境许可时，尽量开较大会议。××两乡的乡民会通知很迟，但集会很早，有些庄子不通知，反比平时的开会整齐，从会议中带给他们“新四军一定还要回来”的坚定信心。这两乡开会动员的经验是：干部全力分头动员，县区负责同志亲自参加，说明两淮转移原因。再度申述我军作战方针，坚持斗争的条件与办法，并明确提出保卫土地改革与武装动员的口号，会上群众在自卫决心鼓舞之下，自动退到地下杀鸡为盟，县区干部也参加进行气节宣誓，区乡干部表示决心“生死与共”“人不死枪不丢”，不离区，不离乡，支持农民“要田保田”的要求，订出战时公约，并予以张贴公布。经过几次会议以后，群众兴奋地说：“是不走了”！“有希望的”！得田的农民陈××不给“庄头”与地主骄傲的表示“中央军”站在你田上，田才算你的，否则休想。
    （二）在游击环境中武装斗争应与土地复查相结合，以贯彻与巩固土地改革，只有经历这一斗争，群众优势才能真正确立。
    该区土地改革在情况变动中起了很大变化，表现在：（一）封建恶霸企图复辟，少数种田的农民被威胁，不敢要田。（二）有些进出田户“留后步”，于是田里收成有的收割一起，有的互让收割说：“日后再说”；“新四军来是我的，中央军来是你的”；“不论中央来不来田是要的，庄稼非收不可”，庄头暗地活动要租。于是全区着手复查土地的准备与思想酝酿，其进行的方式是：
    （一）政府发布命令布告，宣布“田地分好不准暗地送租交地主，不准拿田回头或明分暗不分”，并通过会议动员。
    （二）在时事教育中稳定进田户思想，说服出田的把眼光看远些，号召括田或私割庄稼的出田户“退粮退田”，再度召开进田户会议，商讨怎么贯彻土地改革。
    （三）干部经思想打通后，首先“自查自”，再推己及人，继续群众对破坏土地改革者的斗争。
    （四）每乡培养坚强的群众领袖，成为领导坚持斗争的旗帜与贯彻土地改革的执行骨干，同时改造干部。
    （三）在一切可能成为边缘区的地区，应早作长期坚持打算，同时重新配备适当干部，建立武装。
    这经验是很重要的，该区大批外来干部临时撤走，事先在乡村干部群众思想上应该作充分教育动员，在情况变化前及参军运动之后，应及时建立区队，使情况变化后有全区武装的骨干组织。
