　　Chiang's Soldiers' Road
    He Wei
    [Taiyue Dispatch, December 10th] Hundreds of Chiang's army officers and soldiers, innocently sacrificed for Chiang Kai-shek, lie with their blood and flesh mingled, abandoned among the destroyed bunkers and fortifications by the Eighth Route Army. Our democratic government is now mobilizing local people to bury them. In the battle of Zhuangyuan Village in Yuanqu three days ago, more than ten Chiang's soldiers' corpses have been properly buried. The masses unanimously believe that this kind of sacrifice is worthless. However, a platoon of Chiang's soldiers from Shenjia Village surrendered with their weapons and their lives were guaranteed and their living conditions were well-treated. The people of Yuanqu, witnessing these two distinct judgments, immediately sang a politically meaningful folk song: "Follow Chiang Kai-shek, you're doomed to be unlucky, forced to fight the civil war, no one will bury you when you die! Quickly find a way, come over here as soon as possible, when you get to the Eighth Route Army, they won't kill you and will treat you well!"

    【本报太岳十日电】为蒋贼个人而无辜牺牲之垣曲蒋军官兵尸体数百具，血肉模糊遗弃于被八路军毁灭之碉堡工事间，现我民主政府正动员当地人民加以掩埋。三日垣曲幢原村战斗，蒋军十余具尸体业经妥善掩埋，群众咸认为此种牺牲毫无价值。而申家庄一排蒋军，携械投诚，生命得到保障，生活也受优待。垣曲人民目睹此两种严明裁判，立刻唱起一个富有政治意义的歌谣：“跟上蒋总裁，倒霉你活该，逼你打内战，死了没人埋！赶快想办法，趁早跑过来，到了八路军，不杀还优待！”
