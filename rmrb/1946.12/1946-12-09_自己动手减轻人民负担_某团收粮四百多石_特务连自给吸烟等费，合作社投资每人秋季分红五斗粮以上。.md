　　Lightening the People's Burden Through Self-Reliance
    A Certain Regiment Harvests Over 400 Shi of Grain
  　Special Service Company Self-Sufficient in Smoking and Other Expenses; Cooperative Investment Yields Autumn Dividends of More Than Five Dou of Grain Per Person.
    [Report from this newspaper] The × Regiment of the Ninth Sub-district of Ji'nan has completed its production tasks amidst war. Over the past year, the regiment has persisted in fighting along the eastern area of the Pinghan Railway. In addition to fulfilling the combat missions assigned by higher authorities, they have also engaged in large-scale agricultural production during the intervals between fighting and training. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 463 shi and one dou of grain was harvested. The vegetable garden cultivated by the Third Company of the First Battalion guaranteed their own vegetable supply and also sold 20,000 yuan worth. The Special Service Company not only covered the expenses for the soldiers' smoking, study, and other needs but also invested 300,000 yuan in the cooperative. According to recent settlements, they have already earned 600,000 to 700,000 yuan, and the minimum autumn dividend for each soldier is five dou of grain. These production achievements were all earned through the soldiers' labor. In the spring, the soldiers of the Third Company started plowing and planting as soon as they finished fighting. Their slogan is: "Lighten the burden on the people; feed ourselves with our own hands."

    【本报特讯】冀南九分区×团在战争中完成了生产任务。该团一年来坚持平汉路东边沿区的斗争，除完成上级给予的战斗任务外，并在战斗、练兵的空隙中进行了大规模的农业生产，据不完全统计，共收粮四百六十三石一斗。一营三连种的菜园子，保证了自己吃菜，还卖了两万元。特务连解决了战士吸烟、学习等费用外，还投入合作社三十万元，据最近结算已赚到六、七十万元，仅秋季分红每个战士最少也分到五斗粮食。这些生产成果都是靠战士们的劳力换来的。春天三连战士刚打完仗，就拉耧、种地，他们的口号是：“减轻老百姓负担，用自己的手，饱自己的口。”
