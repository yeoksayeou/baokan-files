  　New and old Chiang soldiers who quit fighting celebrate escaping the sea of suffering of the civil war
    [Our newspaper's special dispatch from the front lines of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region] The emotions of Chiang Army officers and soldiers who are weary of war, anti-Chiang, and homesick are becoming increasingly widespread. According to Li Zhiqiang, a captain and secretary in the 32nd Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the Chiang Army's 11th Division: "Chiang Kai-shek is the second Wang Jingwei, we all understand this in our hearts, but we don't dare to say it out loud." The Chiang Army that invaded our Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area this time is mostly composed of southerners, who are unwilling to leave their hometowns and go north to die. The saying "Rather go South a thousand *li* than North one brick" is widely circulated in the army. Desertion is increasing. When the × Regiment of the 11th Division began its northward deployment, more than a hundred soldiers ran away in two days. Due to the cold weather and unfamiliar climate, Chiang Army soldiers are getting sick abnormally. Dozens of people in the engineering company of the 11th Brigade alone have become ill.
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from the front lines of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 5th] Our army captured a batch of documents in an ambush on the 21st of last month, including a letter from Xiang Ronghuan, the regimental commander of the 286th Regiment of the 96th Division of Chiang's direct line Fifth Army, to his wife, You Liangqiu. It fully reveals the Chiang Army's weariness of war, homesickness, and extreme fear of the brave self-defense of the military and civilians in the liberated areas. It states: "Yesterday I was particularly uneasy. This uneasiness and annoyance are nothing more than being caused by worrying about my wife and children and having no prospect of meeting them! War is truly an extremely cruel thing. Based on this, who among the millions of people participating in the war needs war? I'm afraid it's just one or two people! Those who initiate and promote war should be condemned by heaven... I heard that some impatient wives are thinking of coming here, which is too risky! Maybe you think we have so many troops stationed here, what are we afraid of? But you don't know that the local people here are militiamen, so no matter how anxious you are, don't ever have the idea of 'coming' here."
    We are leaving again, heading to cross the Yellow River. Although no one wants to "cross the Yellow River," what can we do? If we cross the Yellow River, everyone will have a second hope, hoping not to enter the Taihang Mountains...
    [Our newspaper's reporter team dispatch on the 4th] Gou Zaihua, the regimental commander of the 312th Regiment of the 04th Brigade of the 49th Division, and Chen Xiaowen, the regimental commander of the 374th Regiment of the 125th Brigade of the 47th Division, and 550 other field officers and their 24 family members, who laid down their weapons in the Hua County campaign, arrived at the regimental headquarters of the military region's training corps on the 27th and 28th of last month. Political Commissar Zhang and others offered their condolences and hospitality. Brothers from the 41st and 47th Divisions who were liberated in the Taoyuan campaign and are now working in the training corps, saw their former superiors and colleagues and explained the Eighth Route Army's policy of treating prisoners favorably. Zhang Lisheng, a subordinate of Regimental Commander Gou, said: "I have made much progress since I came here. Over there, I was serving the traitorous reactionaries, but now, joining the Eighth Route Army is truly serving the people!" Regimental Commander Gou was all smiles, happy for himself and his colleagues for escaping the civil war. The training corps is currently busy preparing welcome parties and dinners, and preparing various daily necessities. The number of trainees in the training corps has increased from 950 to 1,500, and another 200 field officers will arrive soon. The training corps has expanded from three battalions to five battalions, and is poised to establish a training division. (By Lì Yǐ)

　　“愿南走一千不愿北行一砖”
    蒋军官兵厌战思乡
  　新旧罢战蒋军互庆摆脱内战苦海
    【本报冀鲁豫前线特讯】蒋军官兵厌战反蒋思乡的情绪日益弥漫。据蒋军十一师十一旅卅二团上尉书记长李志强说：“蒋介石是第二个汪精卫，我们心里都明白，就是嘴里不敢说”。此次进犯我冀鲁豫解放区的蒋军，大都是南方人，匀不愿离开家乡，到北方送死，部队中普遍流传着：“愿南走一千，不愿北走一砖”。逃亡现象日益增多，十一师×团在开始北调时，两天即跑掉百余士兵。缘因天气寒冷，水土不服，蒋军士兵生病的异常多，仅十一旅工兵连得病的即达数十人。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线五日电】我军某部于上月二十一日伏击中缴获文件一部，内有蒋嫡系第五军九十六师二八六团团长项荣还寄给其妻游辆秋家书一封，充分显露出蒋军厌战思乡及对解放区军民英勇自卫极端恐惧的情绪。内称：昨天我特别情绪不宁，这种不宁与烦恼，不外是因为挂念自己的妻儿而又见面无期惹起的！战争真是残酷到极点的事，以此推测，千百万参加战争的人们究竟谁需要战争？恐怕也不过是一二人吧！那发动战争的及鼓吹战争的应遭天谴……听说有些性急的太太们想到这里来，真是太冒险了！也许你以为我们驻了这么多军队，还怕什么？殊不知这些地方老百姓就是民兵，所以你再怎样着急，千万存不得“来”的念头。
    我们又要走了，走的方向是要过黄河，虽然谁也不愿“过黄河”，但那有什么办法？黄河过成了，大家又来第二个希望，希望不要入太行山。……
    【本报记者团四日电】滑县战役放下武器之蒋军四九师○四旅三一二团团长苟在华、四十七师一二五旅三七四团团长陈筱文等校尉军官五百五十人，暨眷属二十四人，于上月二十七、八两日抵军区教导团团部，张政委等亲予慰问招待，在桃园战役获得解放，现已参加教导团工作的四一、四七两师的弟兄，看见他们旧的长官和同事，分头解说八路军优待俘虏政策，苟团长的部下张励生说：“我过来进步多啦。在那边是给卖国反动派服务，现在参加八路军才真正是给人民办事呢！”苟团长满面笑容，为自己及同事们摆脱内战而欣喜，现教导团正忙于筹备欢迎会、聚餐会，准备各种日用品，教导团的学员已由九百五十人增至一千五百人，尚有校尉军官二百人不久即可到达，现教导团已由三个大队增至五个大队，势将成立教导师团。（力以）
