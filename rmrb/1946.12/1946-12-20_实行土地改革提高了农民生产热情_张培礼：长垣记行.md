Implementing Land Reform Increased Peasants' Production Enthusiasm
    Zhang Peili's Travelogue of Changyuan

　　On the 20th of last month, the weather was clear, and I arrived in Changyuan, Licheng, and even participated in the mass meeting to struggle against the local tyrant landlord Ma Chou Dan. In the village, I saw the people standing on the winter production front, and their emotions were so incredibly high. I heard the shouts of the oil pressing workers in East Changyuan; as the sun set in the west, the oil hammer was still continuously "Dong! Dong!" This oil mill was jointly established by the masses of East Changyuan, and the oil pressing workers were the villagers themselves. Why was the production enthusiasm of the masses so high during the struggle against Ma Chou Dan? I asked myself. At the same time, however, I heard the rhythmic sound of looms and the tense whirring of spinning wheels. These sounds, which expressed the diligent labor of the people of Changyuan, were directly teaching me to correct an unnecessary conjecture.

    "Could it be that the struggle against Ma Chou Dan has no impact on mass production at all?" I bluntly asked Director Zhang, who was working in Changyuan.

    "It has an impact!" Director Zhang answered me vaguely. I asked myself again, "Could it be that my conjecture is correct?!" But Director Zhang talked to me at length:

    "In the previous period, there was a fluctuation. That was before the masses clearly recognized the targets of the struggle. Rumors spread from the local tyrant landlords, saying that 'the government will struggle against families who can live well,' trying every means to fabricate things out of thin air to undermine the filling movement and winter production, attempting to alleviate the masses' resentment towards them, divert the target, and blame the government. At that time, a small number of confused villagers were fooled and adopted a negative attitude towards production."

    But what about now? Ma Laohan, who had once been negative about production, is now smiling and stroking his white beard, saying to me, "Now I have identified the red beans and white sesame seeds!" The reason is: "In a meeting, Director Zhang told the villagers: 'Not local tyrant landlords, not those who act tyrannically, oppress others by relying on money and power, and have not illegally seized other people's houses and land in the past, the government protects all the interests of every good citizen.' I feel completely relaxed." Now, he is planning: after the struggle against Ma Chou Dan, he will let his eldest son go to Xingtai to do transportation, and he himself is preparing to dig medicinal herbs. When I said goodbye to him, his wrinkled old face showed a firm expression, saying: "The Communist Party is very willing for everyone to get rich!"

    Thus, my incorrect conjecture was also shattered in the face of reality.

　　实行土地改革提高了农民生产热情
    张培礼：长垣记行
    上月二十日，天气晴朗，我到了黎城的长垣，而且参加了斗争恶霸地主马臭旦的群众大会。在村里，我看见了站在冬季大生产战线上的人民，他们的情绪是那样的无比高涨。我听到了东长垣榨油工人的吆喝声，在夕阳西下时，打油锤还在连续的“咚！咚！”着。这座油房是东长垣群众合伙开办的，榨油工人就是本村的老乡，在斗争马臭旦的当儿，群众的生产情绪为什么这样高涨呢？我自己问着自己。可是，我同时又听到了有节拍的织布机声和紧张的纺车声。这些表现长垣人民勤恳劳动的声音，都在直接地教训我改正一种不必要的猜想。
    “难道斗争马臭旦对群众生产毫无一点影响吗”？我率直地问那在长垣工作的张区长。
    “有影响！”张区长笼统地回答我。我又问起我自己：“难道我的猜想是正确的吗？！”但，张区长却滔滔地给我畅谈了：
    “在前些时期，曾经有一个波动，那还是在群众未认识清斗争对象之前，谣言从恶霸地主那里传出来，说什么‘能过光景的人家政府都要斗争’，费尽心机，无中生有地来破坏填补运动和冬季生产，企图达到减轻群众对他们的愤恨，转移目标，嫁祸给政府。当时曾有一少部分思想糊涂的老乡上了当，对生产就抱下了消极的态度。”
    然而现在怎样呢？曾经一度生产消极的马老汉，他现在欢笑的摸着白胡向我说：“现在红小豆、白芝麻，我都认清了！”理由是：“在一个大会上，张区长告诉老乡们说：‘不是恶霸地主，不是横行霸道、依钱仗势压迫别人的，过去没有非法强占过别人的房产土地的，每一个好公民，政府都保护他的一切利益。’心情完全轻松起来了。”现在，他正在计划着：在斗争了马臭旦之后，让大儿子到邢台搞运输，自己准备刨药材，我和他告别时，他那多纹的老脸上，显着坚信的表情说：“共产党很愿意每个人都发财！”
    于是我那不正确的猜想，也就在现实的面前打破了。
