[Report from our Frontline Correspondent Group on the 11th] When reporters arrived at a certain unit on the front lines, they heard the sound of gunfire from target practice and training along the way. Squads of soldiers were conducting field exercises under trees or in cemeteries. West of × Village, there were models of deer fences and walls made of small branches and sorghum stalks, with several piles of unused firewood placed there for nighttime attack exercises. The company published blackboard newspapers with news and experiences from training. At night, squads of soldiers often “disappeared,” only to be found conducting exercises near the defense perimeter. New soldiers who automatically joined the army after emancipation are even more actively studying in order to better fulfill their purpose of joining the army to eliminate Chiang's troops. Their slogan is "Seize the time to train amidst battles, and accelerate climbing over the mountaintop!" (Nai Yi)

[Report from our Weixian Office on the 9th] The First Military Sub-district Bomb Factory convened a factory-wide workers' meeting to review its work in order to guarantee the supply of grenades to the front lines. Instructor Zhao called on every comrade to thoroughly correct the tendency to only seek quantity and not quality, and all the workers then engaged in a heated discussion. Chen Pengzhou said, "I guarantee that every one we make in our group will explode and there won't be a single problem." In the end, the workers discussed and came up with the following methods: 1. After each group makes bombs, they will be handed over to a technical instructor for personal testing, and then the methods will be exchanged with each other, and those who make good ones will be commended and rewarded. 2. Guarantee that there is not a single faulty bomb. If one has a problem, they are willing to accept everyone's criticism, return it for remaking, and will not receive manual labor fees. 3. Do not be conservative, but study each other, exchange experiences, improve technology, and create more styles of bombs.

    深夜犹闻操练声
    前线某部热烈练兵
    冀南炸弹厂具体研究提高质量
    【本报前线记者团十一日电】记者到前线某部时，沿途都听到打靶的枪声和操练声，成班的战士在树下或坟地上进行野战演习。在×村村西有用小树枝和高粱杆插成的鹿寨和围墙模型，并置有数堆未用的柴杆，作夜间攻击演习之用。连队里出版黑板报，登载着练兵的消息和经验。夜间常发现成班的战士“失踪”，原来是自动在防地附近进行演习。翻身后自动参军的新战士，更积极学习，以便更好的完成其参军消灭蒋军的目的。他们的口号是“在战斗中间抓紧时间练兵，加紧爬过山顶！”（乃一）
    【本报威县九日电】一分区分区武委会炸弹工厂，为保证前方手榴弹的供给，特召开全厂工人大会，检讨工作。赵教员号召每个同志要彻底纠正光求数量不求质量的偏向，全体工人相继展开热烈讨论。陈朋周说：“我保证俺这一组造一个响一个，不出一点毛病”。最后工人讨论出以下的办法：一、各组造出炸弹后，交技术教员亲手试验，然后再互相交换办法，造的好的表扬奖励。二、保证没一个有毛病的炸弹，如有一个出了毛病，愿受大家批评，退回另造，不发手工费。三、不保守，互相研究，交流经验，提高技术，创造更多样式的炸弹。
