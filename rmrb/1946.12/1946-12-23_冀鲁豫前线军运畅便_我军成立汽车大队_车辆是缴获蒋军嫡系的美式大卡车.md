　　Smooth Military Transport on the Jilu Yu Front
    Our Army Establishes Motor Vehicle Brigade
    Vehicles are American Trucks Captured from Chiang's Elite Troops
    [Report from Jilu Yu Front by Our Newspaper, 17th] Our reporter Wu Xiang reports: The troops under General Liu Bocheng have established a motor vehicle brigade using automobiles captured from Chiang's army during the Patriotic Self-Defense War, and they are running on the vast Jilu Yu plains. Among them, the heavy-duty trucks and sophisticated and sturdy jeeps manufactured by the American Gemson Company are the most eye-catching. Although these vehicles are very good, they were previously in the hands of the reactionaries. Due to the corruption of Chiang's army, the lack of a just cause, and the soldiers' aversion to war, they could not发挥充分的效能, but now they have been captured by our People's Army and have become a useful means of transportation for the front line of the Self-Defense War. These vehicles were all captured from the American-equipped 11th Division, the 5th Army, and the 10th Artillery Regiment directly under the Military and Political Department. Ordinary Chiang's troops, even the elite 3rd Division, do not have such good cars. However, the five Japanese trucks captured from the 125th Brigade in the Hua County campaign had peeling paint, were dilapidated, and had洋鐵片镶着破玻璃窗上, even more miserable and pathetic than their owners (miscellaneous troops), and even the drivers lost interest in driving them. They excitedly told reporters, "The cars in the past often made the drivers angry, but now these American-equipped cars are fast and don't break down. I really have to thank the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek." Liu Zhao, who had worked in the India-Burma Highway Bureau, the Northwest Highway Bureau, and the Kunming Repair Factory of the Military Commission, said with a smile, "I drove cars for Chiang Kai-shek for eight years, and I never drove such good American cars. I never thought I would be driving them after joining the Eighth Route Army!" He led me to see an engineering vehicle with a large吊钩, took out a pile of big and small老虎钳,套管,油嘴,灭火机..., and explained that these tools and parts for repairing cars were all the latest American products. Last month, these American trucks pulled the American榴弹炮 we captured to the liberated areas, and the masses along the way were overjoyed. Every time they passed a village, they gathered at the entrance of the village, clapping and cheering. After dark, the motors roared, and the electric lights shone for a dozen miles, and the masses in nearby villages came out to watch. The section of road from ×× to ×× was difficult to travel, and countless women and children automatically helped dig mud and push cars, cheering and雷动, more lively than赶会. A certain unit recently held a hero meeting. The combat heroes all sat on hero cars decorated with big red characters. When the hero car passed through the ranks of soldiers and civilians welcoming it into the venue, the heroes, dressed in full American equipment, stood up happily on the American trucks and shouted, "We have won! We have won!"

　　冀鲁豫前线军运畅便
    我军成立汽车大队
    车辆是缴获蒋军嫡系的美式大卡车
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十七日电】本报记者吴象报导称：刘伯承将军所部在爱国自卫战争中，缴获蒋军的汽车，已成立汽车大队，奔驰于冀鲁豫大平原上。其中以美国杰姆生公司制造的载重大卡车及精巧坚固的吉普车，最引人注意。这些车辆虽然很好，可是过去掌握在反动派手里，由于蒋军的腐败，师出无名，兵心厌战，并不能发挥充分的效能，现在被我人民军队缴获，便成为自卫战争前线的有利交通工具。这些车均缴自嫡系美械整十一师、第五军及军政部直属炮兵第十团。一般蒋军，甚至嫡系整三师都没有这样好的汽车。而滑县战役缴获一二五旅的五辆日本卡车，则油漆剥落，破旧不堪，破玻璃窗上镶着洋铁片，比他的主人（杂牌军）还要狼狈可怜，连司机都失去了驾驶的兴趣。他们兴奋地告诉记者说：“过去的汽车常常和司机生气，而现在这些美械化的汽车又迅速、又不出毛病，真要谢谢美国人和蒋介石。”曾经在印缅公路局、西北公路局、军委会昆明修理厂工作过的刘昭笑着说：“我在蒋介石那边开了八年汽车，没有开过这样好的美国汽车，想不到参加八路军后倒开上了！”他领我去看一辆有着大吊钩的工程车，拿出一堆大大小小的老虎钳，套管、油嘴、灭火机……，说明这些修理汽车的工具和零件，都是美国最新的出品。上月，这些美国大卡车拉着我们缴获的美国榴弹炮到解放区，沿途群众都兴奋若狂，每过一村，都群集村头鼓掌叫好。夜深之后，马达隆隆，电光照耀十数里，附近村庄群众纷纷出来看。自××至××一段路不好走，无数妇女儿童自动帮助挖泥推车，欢呼雷动，比赶会还热闹。某部日前召开英雄大会，战斗英雄们都坐在装饰着大红字的英雄车上、当这英雄车通过军民欢迎的行列进入会场时，换上全副美械装备的英雄们，都兴高彩烈地在美国大卡车上站起来，高喊：“我们胜利了！我们胜利了！”
