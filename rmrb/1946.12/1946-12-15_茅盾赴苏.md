    Mao Dun Visits the Soviet Union
    The famous writer Mao Dun, at the invitation of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, has departed for the Soviet Union for a visit. He and his wife set off from Shanghai on November 28th. Before his departure, various circles in Shanghai gave him a warm send-off. On the 24th, ten organizations including the Shanghai Literary Association, the Woodcut Association, the Drama Association, and the Music Association jointly held a farewell gathering. Ye Shengtao presided over the event, and Guo Moruo, Xu Guangping, Hu Feng, and others delivered farewell speeches on behalf of various organizations. A representative of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Mr. Latkin, delivered a speech, hoping that Mao Dun's visit to the Soviet Union would only be a beginning, and that there could be frequent exchanges of cultural envoys between China and the Soviet Union in the future. Various organizations presented representative works to Mao Dun to take to the Soviet Union. Mao Dun himself also collected a large number of representative works from China's literary and art circles, amounting to as many as six boxes. In his speech at the farewell gathering, Mao Dun expressed his willingness to do his best so as not to disappoint the expectations of his friends.

After they returned to their companies, they ran company art training classes; as a result, art training work was greatly expanded in each company.
