    Women Participating in Textile Production
    Transforming Themselves and Improving Their Status
    [This Newspaper's Report] Recently, many women in various places have been transformed through the textile movement, and their family and social status has also greatly improved. In Chihu Village, Xingtai, under the leadership of Yao Dezeng and Guo Aini's textile movement, thirty-eight women have been transformed. This includes three types: The first type is women who lacked the ability to endure oppression from their parents-in-law and husbands at home, such as Dong Qiuren, etc. Because they learned to weave, they improved their status at home. The second type is women who had disagreements with their parents-in-law, such as Meng Xiuying, etc. By taking the money earned from weaving home, they strengthened their relationship with their parents-in-law. The third type is women who were lazy and gluttonous. The method of having others compete with her was used to increase her enthusiasm for weaving. Now, the textile movement led by Yao Dezeng and Guo Aini in Chihu Village has become the direction of textile work in Xingtai. They also assist other villages in developing textiles, absorbing eight women from villages such as Huazi to learn textiles in Chihu. After learning, they return to their villages to teach others. In addition, they sent five people to teach textiles in eight villages such as Taoshu, teaching 200 people in one month, earning only a small salary in the process. Wang Taomei, a first-class textile hero in Wuxiang, was originally a female loafer and looked down upon. She found five women like herself and formed a group to start weaving. As a result, she earned money and bought land. Everyone changed their attitude towards her because of her actual transformation, and she became even more motivated. Now her group has grown to forty-two people, led by her, and operates in three groups. She personally can weave more than two and a half zhang of cloth a day, can dye eighty chi of cloth, can spin sixteen liang of cotton, and can also weave thirteen kinds of patterned cloth such as willow twig patterns. She was selected by the county as a first-class textile hero this time.

    妇女参加纺织生产
    改造自己提高地位
    【本报讯】最近各地在纺织运动中改造了不少妇女，家庭社会地位也大提高。邢台拆虎村在姚德增、郭爱妮领导的纺织运动中，已有三十八个妇女得到改造。其中包括三种型：第一种是没能耐在家中受公婆及丈夫压迫的妇女，如董秋仁等，因学会了纺织，提高了在家中的地位。第二种是和公婆不和睦的妇女，如孟秀英等，纺织赚的钱拿回家去，密切了和公婆的关系。第三种是好吃懒做的妇女，用别人和她竞赛办法，提高了她的纺织积极性。现在姚德增、郭爱妮领导拆虎村的纺织运动已成了邢台的纺织方向。她俩并协助外村开展纺织，吸收滑子等村八个妇女到拆虎学纺织，学会后回村教别人。另外并曾派出五人到桃树等八个村子去教纺织，一个月教会了二百人，在教中只赚很少工资。武乡一等纺织英雄王桃梅，原来是个女二流子，被人看不起，她便找了五个和自己一样的妇女组成了一个组，开始纺织，结果赚了钱买了地。大家都因为她的实际转变而改变了对她的态度，她也就干得更带劲了。现在她的组已发展到四十二人，由她领导，分三组活动。她个人每天能织二丈二尺多布，能刷八十尺布，纺花能纺十六两，还能织柳条花等十三种花布。这次被县里选为一等纺织英雄。
