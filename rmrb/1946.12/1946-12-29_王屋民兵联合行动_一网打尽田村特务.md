　　Wangwu Militia Joint Action
　　Rounding Up Tiancun Secret Agents
　　[Our newspaper, Taiyue, 26th dispatch] Border villages such as Wangwu Beiyang in northern Henan, smashed the reactionary landlord's and Chiang's secret agents' secretly organized "Revenge Squad" at the end of last month. Gao Lingyun, the biggest special agent leader in Wangwu, fled to Yuncheng out of fear of crime during the mass movement. After the Chiang army occupied Yuanqu, he sneaked into Yuanqu city. In August this autumn, he organized the "Return Home Corps," attempting to suppress the mass movement with terrorist means and steal the fruits of the mass struggle. This was smashed by us. This winter, he instigated his brother-in-law Wang Honglei, a special agent hiding in Tiancun, to secretly organize the "Revenge Squad," which had more than 30 henchmen such as Shang Hengde, Wu Dianxiang, Liu Zhenlu, Wang Xiujiang, and Shang Xiaoxue. They conspired to use armed force to suppress the masses' struggle to turn themselves over, first using Shang Zhongjie, a farmer who had turned himself over but had ideological concerns, to influence his cousin, militia cadre Li ××, attempting to disintegrate the militia armed forces and kill the masses who had turned themselves over. However, Li ×× was a firm and brave model cadre. He told the farmers' association cadres everything his cousin had told him and deployed the militia to defend closely. The cadres of the armed forces committee said: "The special agents are dancing in our palms, it is ready when we want their lives." Then they found Shang Zhongjie to educate him, raised his class consciousness, made him realize the insidious behavior of reactionary landlords and special agents, and he finally confessed and resolutely expressed that he would follow the farmers who had turned themselves over, exposing all the deployments of Chiang's special agents. As a result, the masses and militia in villages such as Beiyang and Tiancun jointly rounded up all the special agents such as Wang Honglei and Shang Hengde. According to Wang Honglei's confession, their plan was to first kill Wang Xiusheng, chairman of the district farmers' association, Meng Guangli, standing committee member of the armed forces committee, Zhang Kaixiang, village militia instructor, and Cui Shixiang, chairman of the village armed forces committee, and then reverse the gains of the struggle. On the 25th of last month, hundreds of people from Beiyang and other villages gathered to publicly try these special agents. In the trial by the masses, who was light and who was heavy was clearly distinguished. Except for Wang Honglei, Shang Hengde, Wu Dianxiang, and other "thick roots" who were sentenced to death, Shang Xiaoxue and Shang Lide were new roots and should be won over and sent to the educational institution for education, while Shang Zhongjie, Shang Liuhaideng, were released on the spot. From then on, the area north of Wangwu Highway was as stable as ever, and the masses' struggle to turn themselves over continued.

　　王屋民兵联合行动
    一网打尽田村特务
    【本报太岳二十六日电】豫北王屋北阳等边沿村，于上月底破获反动地主与蒋特秘密组织的“复仇队”。王屋最大特务头子高凌云，在群众运动中畏罪逃往运城，在蒋军侵占垣曲后窜至垣曲城内，今秋八月曾组织“返乡团”，企图以恐怖手段镇压群众运动，盗取群众斗争果实，被我破获，冬季又唆使其暗藏在田村的妹夫特务王鸿雷，秘密组织“复仇队”，有爪牙尚恒德、吴殿祥、刘振陆、王秀江、尚小学等三十余人，阴谋利用武装镇压群众翻身斗争，首先利用了思想上有顾虑的翻身农民尚中介，活动其表兄民兵干部李××，企图瓦解掌握民兵武装，杀害翻身群众，但李××是坚定勇敢的模范干部，他将其表弟给他所谈的，一五一十的告诉了农会干部，并布置民兵严密防卫，武委会的干部说：“特务在我们手掌上跳舞，什么时候要他们的命是现成的”，随即将尚中介找来进行教育，提高了他的阶级觉悟，使其认识反动地主与特务的毒辣行为，他终于坦白了，并坚决表示跟翻身农民走，暴露了蒋特所有的布置。于是北阳、田村等村群众民兵大联合，将王鸿雷、尚恒德等特务全部捕获。据王鸿雷自供，他们的计划是首先杀死区农会主席王秀生，武委会常委孟光里，村民兵指导员张开祥，村武委会主席崔世祥，然后再倒算斗争果实。上月二十五日北阳等村数百群众集会，公审这批特务，在群众的审判中，谁轻谁重，分别得很清楚，除王鸿雷、尚恒德、吴殿祥等“粗根”处以极刑外，尚小学、尚立德是新根，应争取，送进教育所进行教育，而尚中介、尚六海等，则当场释放，从此王屋公路以北安定如昔，群众翻身斗争继续进行。
