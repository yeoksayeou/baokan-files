    Border Region Government Issues Order
    Protect the Property of the Liberated Masses
    Those Who Collude with Chiang Kai-shek's Agents to Conduct Illegal Reversals of Verdicts Will Be Punished According to Law
    [Our Special Dispatch] Recently, it has been reported from various border areas that a small number of local bullies and landlords who do not understand righteousness, under the instigation of enemy agents and in coordination with Chiang Kai-shek's troops, are carrying out reactionary "reversals of verdicts." The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government has issued a public notice a few days ago, pointing out: 1. All land, houses and other properties recovered by peasants in the movement to oppose traitors, settle accounts, and reduce rent and interest to realize "land to the tillers" are legal properties, and no one may deprive or infringe upon them. 2. Landlords who abide by government laws and regulations, refuse to "reverse verdicts" and voluntarily hide or avoid "reversals of verdicts," or who are forced to reverse verdicts under the threat of enemy agents and Chiang Kai-shek's troops but voluntarily return the property to the peasants after the announcement of this notice, the government will protect their lives and property. 3. For those traitors and local bullies who have been accused and settled accounts by the people, if they are law-abiding and no longer used by enemy agents to oppress the people, the government will not hold them accountable for the past and will protect their human rights, land rights, and property rights according to law. 4. Those who are die-hard, collude with enemy agents, rely on the temporary power of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and organize "Love the Village Corps," "Revenge Squads," "Returning Home Corps," "Reversal of Verdicts Squads," etc. to resist the government, kill the people, and rob the land, houses, and other properties legally obtained by the people, in addition to mobilizing the people to settle accounts again, they will be severely punished according to law.

    【本报特讯】近据各地边沿区反映，有一小部分恶霸及不明大义之地主，在奸特唆使、蒋军配合之下，进行反动“倒算”。晋冀鲁豫边区政府特于日前颁发布告指出：一、凡农民在反奸、清算、减租减息实现“耕者有其田”运动中所收回之土地、房屋及其他财产，均为合法财产，任何人不得剥夺或侵犯。二、凡地主恪守政府法令，拒绝“倒算”及自动隐藏、躲避“倒算”，或慑于奸特、蒋军威胁被迫倒算而在布告后自动退回农民者，政府当对其生命、财产予以保障。三、凡被人民控诉、清算过之汉奸、恶霸、安分守己，不再受奸特利用，欺压人民者，政府当不咎既往，依法保障其人权、地权、财权。四、凡死心塌地，勾结奸特，依仗蒋军一时之势力，组织“爱乡团”“复仇队”“还乡团”“倒算队”等反抗政府、杀害人民、抢夺人民依法取得之土地、房屋及其他财产者，除发动人民再行清算外，并依法予以严厉制裁。（秀山）
