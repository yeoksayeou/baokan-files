Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 26th: According to reports from various sources, the war between France and Vietnam, which restarted with the Haiphong-Hanoi incident as its starting point, has spread to various places along the coast of the Gulf of Tonkin, and may expand to the entire northern Vietnam. Fierce fighting is taking place in the Ba Ninh and Lang Son line northeast of Hanoi and near Nam Dinh in the southeast. Due to the French army's attacks, the Viet Minh army, after inflicting over 200 casualties on the French army, has withdrawn from Hanoi and controls the four suburbs with 30,000 troops. The Vietnamese people are extremely indignant at the French army for launching a war in violation of the agreement. Emergency mobilizations have been carried out in various places to conduct widespread anti-French movements; workers at the Hong Gai coal mine have begun work slowdowns. The Vietnamese delegation in Paris declared on the 23rd: "If the French side insists on negotiating with the Vietnamese people by force, it will encounter the resistance of 20 million Vietnamese men and women determined to defend the freedom of their fatherland." French de Gaulle elements are plotting to expand the military solution. A cruiser left Algiers on the 23rd, carrying the first regiment of French paratroopers to Vietnam. Fulerke may be appointed as the supreme commander of the French army in Vietnam. LeClerc has commanded the French African colonial army for many years. French Overseas Minister Moutet and French Commissioner to Vietnam D'Argenlieu flew from Paris to Saigon on the 23rd.
