　　The enemy's plan to cut off contact between Jiangsu-Anhui and Shandong has failed miserably.
    The Northern Jiangsu encirclement campaign concludes victoriously.
    Over 22,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops were annihilated, with the 69th Division Commander Dai Zhiqi killed in action, and Deputy Division Commander Yao Shaowei and 60th Brigade Commander Huang Baode captured; captured 134 various artillery pieces and countless other weapons.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 24th dispatch] The unprecedented large-scale encirclement battle in Suqian and Shuyang concluded victoriously on the 19th after five consecutive days and nights of fierce fighting. A total of three brigades of invading Chiang Kai-shek troops were annihilated: the Pre-3rd Brigade (formerly a division) of the 57th Division (formerly the 98th Army), the 41st Brigade (division) of the 26th Division (Army), and the 60th Brigade (division) of the 69th Division (formerly the 99th Army). Also, parts of the 92nd Brigade, the 276th Division, the 18th Brigade of the 11th Division, and the 11th Brigade, as well as the entire 5th Engineer Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's Army Headquarters (previously misreported as one battalion of the 15th Engineer Regiment). Chiang Kai-shek commander, 69th Division Commander (formerly 99th Army Commander) Dai Zhiqi, was killed, with over 6,000 officers and soldiers killed or wounded. Over 16,000 Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers were captured, including 69th Division Deputy Commander Yao Shaowei and 60th Brigade Commander Huang Baode. Seized: 12 field guns, 30 mountain guns, 8 anti-tank guns, 2 Type 92 infantry guns, over 50 mortars, 29 60mm mortars, 3 rocket launchers, over 75 heavy machine guns, over 500 light machine guns, over 200 small cannons and grenade launchers, 19 vehicles, 11 radio stations, hundreds of mules and horses, over 500,000 rounds of various ammunition, countless rifles and other military supplies, and one airplane was shot down. This is one of the times the Jiangsu-Anhui People's Liberation Army has inflicted annihilating blows on Chiang's army with minimal cost and maximum results. Chiang Kai-shek's arrogant plan to eliminate the Jiangsu-Anhui people's armed forces or compress the main force of the New Fourth Army to southern Shandong by mobilizing heavy troops from Henan-Shandong-Hebei and southern Shandong in an attempt to cut off the connection between the two major liberated areas of Jiangsu-Anhui and Shandong has already suffered a disastrous defeat.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 24th dispatch] Frontline reporter Zhang Jinghua reported on the New Fourth Army's provisional burial of Chiang Kai-shek's fallen 69th Division Commander (formerly 99th Army Commander) Dai Zhiqi, stating: After the Renheji battle, when the New Fourth Army discovered Dai's body among the Chiang Kai-shek corpses, they immediately ordered troops to guard it, prepare a coffin, and carefully bury it in the center of a temple site, risking bombing by Chiang's planes, and erected a tombstone with the inscription: "The Tomb of Dai Zhiqi, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Reorganized 69th Division, who died executing reactionary military orders." The New Fourth Army's military and political authorities have now issued an order to all sectors to protect the tomb and have agreed to do their best to protect and assist his family in coming to transport the body back.

　　敌图截断苏皖山东联系已惨败
    苏北大围歼战胜利结束
    计歼蒋军两万二千余人，六十九师师长戴之奇被击毙，副师长姚少伟及六十旅旅长黄保德被俘；缴获各种炮一百三十四门及其他武器无算。
    【新华社华中二十四日电】宿（迁）沭（阳）空前之大围歼战，经连续五昼夜激战，已于十九日胜利结束。计歼灭进犯蒋军五十七师（原九十八军）之预三旅（原师）、二十六师（军）之四十一旅（师）、六十九师（原九十九军）之六十旅（师）三个旅全部，九十二旅、二七六师、十一师之十八旅和十一旅各一部，及蒋介石陆军总部工兵第五团全部（前误为工兵第十五团一个营），击毙蒋军指挥官六十九师师长（原九十九军军长）戴之奇，毙伤官兵六千余人，俘获蒋军六十九师副师长姚少伟、六十旅旅长黄保德等官兵一万六千余人，缴获野炮十二门、山门三十门、战车防御炮八门、九二式步兵炮二门，迫击炮五十余门、六○炮二十九门，火箭炮三门、重机枪七十五挺、轻机枪五百余挺、小炮及掷弹筒二百余个、汽车十九辆、电台十一架，骡马数百匹、各种弹药五十余万发、步枪与其他军用品无算，击落飞机一架。这是苏皖人民解放军屡予蒋军歼灭打击中付代价极小获得战果最大之一次。蒋介石此次由冀鲁豫及鲁南等地调集重兵，企图消灭苏皖人民武装力量或压缩新四军主力至鲁南，以截断苏皖与山东两大解放区联系之狂妄计划，业已遭到惨败。
    【新华社华中二十四日电】前线记者张景华报导新四军代葬蒋军阵亡六十九师师长（原九十九军军长）戴之奇情形略称：当人和集战斗结束后，新四军从蒋军遗尸中发现戴氏尸体时，即饬令派兵守护，备棺装殓，冒蒋机轰炸危险，妥为安葬于一庙地中心，并为之建立墓碑，上书“为执行反动军令而死的整编第六十九师中将师长戴之奇之墓”。现新四军军政当局通令各界保护该墓，并允尽力保护与协助其家属来此运回。
