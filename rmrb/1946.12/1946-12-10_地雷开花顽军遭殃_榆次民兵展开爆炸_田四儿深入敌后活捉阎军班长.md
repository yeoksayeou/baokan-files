　　Mines Bloom, Stubborn Troops Suffer
　　Yuci Militia Launch Explosions
　　Tian Si'er Penetrates Enemy Lines and Captures Yan Army Squad Leader
　　[Changzhi, 7th dispatch] The Yuci border area militia's mine explosions continue to be successful, killing 14 Yan puppet troops in half a month. In order to make explosions a truly mass movement, the county recently put forward the slogan "Mines bloom everywhere, stubborn troops suffer everywhere," and specially hired more than 100 explosive experts from the Zuoquan Support Company to go to the second and third districts to train explosions in various villages. The initial training content is divided into five types: step-on mines, stone-hanging mines, bow mines, door-hanging mines, and pull mines. The training method focuses on combining with actual struggles. On the 6th of last month, when the enemy came to犯 Dongqi Village, the militia of Zhuang'er Village rushed to support and wounded two enemies. The enemy fled back to the city. On the same day, the militia of Nanbeitian, Zhanghu and other villages, led by explosion hero Tian Si'er, advanced to Weiyue Village on the enemy's rear transportation line and captured one Yan army self-defense team squad leader and one member. On the 12th, the militia youth company of our first district killed and wounded one enemy each in Shangge Village and repelled them without any losses on our side. Afterwards, the militia immediately reviewed and said, "Strike first to gain the upper hand, strike later to suffer."

  　田四儿深入敌后活捉阎军班长
    【长治七日电】榆次边地民兵地雷爆炸继续获胜，半月内炸死阎伪十四名。该县为使爆炸真正成为群众性的运动，最近特提出“地雷到处开花，顽军到处遭殃”的口号，专聘左权支援连百余名爆炸手，前赴二、三两区各村训练爆炸，初期训练内容分踏起雷、石吊雷、弓雷、门挂雷、拉雷等五种。其训练方式，着重与实际斗争相结合。上月六日，敌来犯东祁村，我庄儿村民兵赶来支援，打伤敌人两名，敌逃跑回城，同日夜，南北田、张胡等村民兵，在爆炸英雄田四儿领导下挺进到敌后交通线的魏岳村，活捉阎军自卫大队班长、队员各一人。十二日我一区民兵青年连在上戈村毙伤敌各一，将其击退，我无损失。事后民兵马上检讨说：“先下手为强，后下手遭殃”。
