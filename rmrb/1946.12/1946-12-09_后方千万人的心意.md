　　The Hearts of Millions in the Rear

　　Ding Man

　　In the courtyard of the Political Department office of the frontline field army, a large number of comfort goods are piled up, sent by five counties including Nangong in Southern Hebei. On the morning of the 28th of last month, although the weather was very cold, the people visiting the comfort items were extremely crowded, everyone praising the ingenious creations of the thousands of women, the various styles of comfort bags, with striped flowers, square flowers, red and green flowers embroidered with more flowers. The flower-woven comfort bags were filled with towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste, pipes, dry tobacco, needles and thread, pencils, diaries, grenade bags, shoes and socks, sock bottoms, pen bags... all the soldiers' daily necessities, and pears, dates, peanuts, pomegranates and other foods.

　　The comfort bag from the parishioners of the Nangong Catholic Church contained masks, pencils, pencil sharpeners, bandages, diaries, soap, safety pins, tobacco pouches, matches and five lunch packages... as well as two copies of "Meng Xiangying and Guo Fanzi." Written on the comfort bag were the words of Mr. Lu Xun: "Fiercely browed, I coolly face the pointing fingers of a thousand; Head bowed, like a willing ox I serve the children."

　　Women also universally embroidered verses on the comfort bags. Zhao Shuqin, a member of the Women's Rescue Association of Dujiazhuang Village, Gaotang County, embroidered on her comfort bag: "Fight the Chiang troops in the front, don't worry about family matters." The comfort bag of the Women's Rescue Association of Fangjiazhuang Village, Nangong, was embroidered with: "Bravely kill the enemy without change, leave a good name for eternity." Wang Xiuying, a member of the Women's Association of Zhoujiazhuang Village, Gaotang County, neatly embroidered on a silk handkerchief: "Wishing you a hundred battles, a hundred victories, not returning home until the Chiang bandits are defeated!"

　　More than a hundred letters were written by military dependents, village cadres, business circles, factories, and parishioners to comfort the frontline soldiers. The mother of × Xi of Yiheju, East Street, Nangong City, wrote to him: "I hope my son resolutely completes the tasks assigned by his superiors at the front, aspires to meritorious service, defeats the Chiang bandits, so that mother and son can reunite and live a good life." He Chun of Sujiatun wrote to her younger brother He Yingshou: "While you are fighting the enemy in the front, we in the rear are also mobilized, making shoes, socks, and comfort bags for the army, and have also mobilized a large number of young and strong men to join the army, who will soon join you and fight side by side." Zhen Ying's wife wrote to Zhen Ying: "The traitor Chiang Kai-shek has dispatched a large army to attack our liberated areas. You, my husband, have joined the revolution and followed the army to the front, and have a deeper understanding of Chiang's treacherous dictatorship. You should cheer up and defend the people and the liberated areas. Your wife is at home awaiting your news of victory." The entire village men and women and village cadres of Xidi Village, Nangong, wrote to Chen Wei Yue: "Your child is very strong, and your family planted ten mu of wheat this year. Now our village has organized a preferential treatment committee, and each department has taken responsibility to ensure that military dependents have food to eat, a place to live, and all difficulties at home are promptly resolved." The parishioners of the Nangong Catholic Church wrote: "Dear comrades: You are shedding blood and fighting, sacrificing yourselves without hesitation, for our liberation, peace, and democracy. We admire and appreciate this spirit of serving the people! We pray for you comrades and wish you all the best. We now present a small comfort bag, please accept it, comrades. As the saying goes, "The melon seeds are small, but they represent the people's hearts," the comfort bag is small, but it is the heart of the people in the rear."

　　后方千万人的心意
    丁曼
    前线野战兵团政治部办公室的院里。堆积起大批的慰劳品，这是冀南南宫等五个县送来的。上月二十八号的早晨，天气虽然很冷，参观慰劳品的人却拥挤不堪，人人在称赞这千万个妇女们天才创造的各种样式的慰劳袋，有条子花，方块花，红红绿绿的花上又绣着花。织着花的慰问袋里，装满手巾、牙刷、牙粉、烟斗、旱烟、针线、铅笔、日记本、手榴弹袋、鞋袜、袜底、钢笔袋……一切战士们的日常用品，和梨、枣、花生、石榴等食品。
    南宫天主教总堂教民的慰问袋内，装着口罩、铅笔、铅笔刀、绷带、日记本、肥皂、别针、烟袋、洋火和五个饭包……还有两本《孟祥英和郭凡子》。慰问袋上写着鲁迅先生的话：“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛！”
    妇女们在慰问袋上还普遍的绣着诗句。高唐县杜家庄妇救会员赵叔琴的慰问袋上绣着：“前方杀敌打蒋军，家庭事情你放心。”南宫房家庄妇救会的慰问袋上绣着：“英勇杀敌世无变，留得美名万古扬。”高唐县周家庄妇会员王秀英在花绸子手绢上工整地绣着：“祝百战百胜，不打退蒋贼不回家！”
    军属、村干部、商界、工厂、教民等写信百余封，慰问前方将士。南宫城内东街义和居×玺的母亲给他写信说：“望吾儿在前方对上级任务坚决完成，立志立功劳，把蒋贼打走，母子团圆，过好日子。”苏家屯何春给她弟弟何英守写信说：“你们在前方打敌人，我们在后方也都动员起来了，给军队做鞋子、做袜子、做慰劳袋等，还发动了广大的青壮年去参军，他们不久就会跟你们会合，并肩作战。”侦英的妻子写给侦英的信说：“国贼蒋介石，派遣大军进攻咱解放区。夫投身革命，随军前方，对蒋贼之卖国独裁，更了解深刻，你当振作精神，为人民自卫、保卫解放区。妻在家等候你的胜利捷音。”南宫西底村，全村男女及村干部写信给陈维岳说：“你家的小孩体格非常结实，今年你家种上了十亩麦子。现在咱村组织了优抗委员会，各部门负起了责任，今后保证抗属有饭吃，有房住，家中一切困难保证及时解决。”南宫天主教总堂教民写信说：“诸位同志们：你们为了我们的解放、和平与民主，流血奋斗，不惜牺牲，这种为人民服务的精神，我们万分钦佩与感激！我们为诸位同志们祈祷，祝同志们一切顺利。今奉上小小的慰问袋，祈同志收下吧。常言说：“瓜子不大是人心”，慰问袋不大，是后方人民的心意。”
