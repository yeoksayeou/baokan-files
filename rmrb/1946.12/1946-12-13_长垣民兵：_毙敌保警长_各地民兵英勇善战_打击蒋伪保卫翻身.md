    [This Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 11th] "One person dies, ten thousand are happy" - this is how the masses reacted to the killing of Chen Wenyan, the first squad leader of the Chiang-controlled Dongming Security Police. On the evening of the 10th of last month, dozens of our Changyuan 9th District militiamen were operating in the northern part of the district when they encountered patrolling officers and soldiers of the 1st team of the Dongming Chiang Security Police. After a five-minute battle, they captured Chen Wenyan, the Chiang special agent, first squad leader of the Dongming Security Police, and deputy leader of the Wuqiu Township puppet "People's Self-Defense Force", and wounded one of his followers. Chen Wenyan was from Chenzhai Village in the district, an opium addict and habitual bandit. In October 1944, he joined the Dongming traitor Du Shu's unit. When we recovered Dongming this spring, he fled to Changyuan city. On October 30th, he was appointed as the first squad leader of the Chiang-controlled Dongming Security Police and other positions, and actively cooperated with the Chiang army to harass the people, forcing the masses in various villages to return the fruits of struggle that had been legally reclaimed, hand over the government's production loans, and stipulated the vicious method of "make one pay for three." The masses hated him to the core. Therefore, when the good news of Chen Wenyan's killing by our militia spread, the masses all said: "This has eliminated a great scourge for us. It is truly a case of one person's death bringing happiness to ten thousand."

    长垣民兵：
    毙敌保警长
    各地民兵英勇善战
    打击蒋伪保卫翻身
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】“一人丧命，万人高兴”，这是蒋记东明保警第一分队长陈文彦被击毙后，群众的反映。上月十日晚，我长垣九区民兵数十人，活动于该区北部，当即与东明蒋保警第一队之巡哨官兵遭遇，激战五分钟，即将蒋特东明保警第一分队长、武邱乡伪“民众自卫队”队副陈文彦擒获，击伤其随从一人。陈文彦系该区陈寨村人，大烟鬼惯匪，三十三年十月投奔东明汉奸杜淑部，今春我收复东明时，他又逃至长垣城内。十月三十日受委为蒋记东明保警一分队长等职，即积极配合蒋军出来骚扰，强迫各村群众倒出合法要回的斗争果实，交出我政府之生产贷款，并规定“使一个交三个”的狠毒办法，群众恨之入骨。故当陈文彦被我民兵击毙的捷报传出后，群众都说：“这可是给咱除了大害，真是一人丧命，万人高兴”。
