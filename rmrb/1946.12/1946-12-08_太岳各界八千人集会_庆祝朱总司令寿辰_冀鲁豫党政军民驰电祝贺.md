　　[Report from Taiyue, December 6th] Representatives from all walks of life in our region held a grand meeting in Yangcheng on the 3rd to celebrate Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's birthday, with over 8,000 people attending. At five in the morning, stores in the city swept the streets in the freezing weather, and men and women dressed in bright colors, each person filled with joy. At noon, many ordinary people carried their own longevity peaches and various birthday gifts in an endless stream. A couplet sent by the people of Nanguan read: "Commander-in-Chief's longevity is like the ever-young pine of the Southern Mountain, the blessings of the common people are as long as the flowing waters of the Eastern Sea." After the meeting began, Comrade Li Zheren gave a report on Commander-in-Chief Zhu's chronology, each word and sentence inspiring the people, and called for learning from Commander-in-Chief's spirit of serving the people. The people of Yangcheng said, "Commander-in-Chief has been here, at first no one knew he was the Commander-in-Chief, he really endured hardship and worked hard." The soldiers of the guard company said: "We must study hard from the Commander-in-Chief." Liu Zhiyuan, the adjutant of the 1st Regiment of the 1st Brigade of Hu Zongnan, who laid down his arms on the Tongpu front, said with emotion: "Commander-in-Chief Zhu is truly the people's Commander-in-Chief, who has dedicated his life to the people,不怕困难，不怕挫折，四十年如一日, not fearing difficulties, not fearing setbacks, for forty years as if it were a single day, worthy of revolutionary soldiers to learn from." When presenting birthday gifts, Bi Jinchuan, the representative of the people, said: "Today everyone comes to hold this 'joyful meeting' to celebrate the 60th birthday of the Commander-in-Chief, why are we all here to celebrate? Like me, who suffered the most in the past, it was as if twelve mules were pulling a large millstone that couldn't turn a full circle in three days, pressing down on me. Commander-in-Chief Zhu brought the Eighth Route Army to uncover this big stone slab for me, and I was liberated." Then Jiao Qingliang, a major who laid down his arms on the Tongpu front, delivered a speech, expressing his joy at being able to participate in Commander-in-Chief Zhu's birthday celebration, and then said passionately: "Commander-in-Chief Zhu's birthday is connected with the history of the Chinese nation, Commander-in-Chief Zhu's health is combined with the health of the Chinese nation, if he is healthy, the Chinese nation will be healthy; Chiang Kai-shek is the opposite of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, he is a disaster for the Chinese people." The whole audience shouted, "Commander-in-Chief Zhu is the lucky star of the people! Chiang Kai-shek is the scourge of the people!" Finally, the conference passed a congratulatory telegram to actually celebrate the birthday by winning more battles and paid tribute to Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
    [Report from Hebei-Shandong-Henan] The Party, government, military, and civilians of our region jointly sent a telegram to congratulate Commander-in-Chief Zhu on his 60th birthday. The original telegram read: Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    We congratulate you on your 60th birthday with utmost love and striving. You have fought bravely throughout your life, are a model for the entire Party and army, and a banner for the people of the entire liberated area. Today, Chiang Kai-shek is determined to sell out the country to the end, and be a dictator to the end, launching a full-scale civil war with the help of American imperialism. In the months of fighting in which we have annihilated a large number of Chiang's troops, we have realized the correctness and greatness of your instructions, and will continue to annihilate all invading Chiang's troops, defend the liberated areas, defend the democratic holy land - Yan'an, defend Chairman Mao, until the victory of China's independence, peace, and democracy. We wish you good health! Hebei-Shandong-Henan Regional Party Committee, Military Region, Administrative Office, Federation, Military Committee.
