　　Shexian, Changzhi Experience:
    Unite with Middle Peasants Even More During Investigation and Reduction
    [Report from this newspaper] In Shexian, 76 villages have been stirred up within half a month of investigation and rent reduction. The intensity, speed, and breadth of the movement are unprecedented. According to preliminary summaries, the following experiences have been gained: (1) Break the self-satisfied thinking of cadres. Many cadres believe, "This is an old liberated area for us, and after several years of investigation and rent reduction, the work has been done well!" Therefore, at the beginning of the movement, an activist training class was held, using concrete examples of peasants who have not thoroughly turned over to correct the self-satisfied thinking of cadres. (2) Distinguish the peasant line, affirm that middle and poor peasants are one family, and strive to win the sympathy and support of more than 90% of the people. Landlord feudal forces, seeing the vigorous development of the peasant movement, try every means to sabotage it, bribe cadres, feign "enlightenment," disperse materials; on the other hand, they threaten and lure basic masses, provoke disputes between middle and poor peasants, and attempt to undermine the movement. At this time, it is very important to conduct class education among all peasants, to specifically classify middle peasants as part of the peasant side, to distinguish camps, and to absorb them into the struggle, thoroughly correcting the thinking of some masses that middle peasants have some extra wealth (especially those who became rich through production), and it would be okay to struggle against them, so that the landlords are completely isolated. For example, in Shangqingliang Temple in the ninth district, after clarifying the targets of struggle, the broad masses of middle peasants poured into the peasant association, and the peasant association surged from more than 60 people to more than 140 people. In Kuangmen in the sixth district, during the accusations of suffering, 18 running dogs completely repented and confessed, and offered up the things hidden by the landlord. (3) Inspire accusations of suffering and clearing of accounts, so that the masses move spontaneously. Some villages, due to the simplified methods of cadres, did not mobilize the masses ideologically, to accuse landlords of their wrongdoings and reason with them, and only simply wanted things, the result was that the cadres were only dancing nakedly, the landlords were not overthrown, and the masses did not recognize that the struggle against the landlords was reasonable and legal, and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. On the contrary, in Shimen in the second district, ideological education was carried out in the winter school, and as a result, the masses spontaneously began to pour out their grievances, pouring out the bitterness that had not been poured out for many years. In Tanli Village, when the men were away on business trips, the women carried out the struggle themselves at home. In Xigang Village in the ninth district, due to the good ideological mobilization, the men and women of the whole village moved greatly and overthrew the local tyrant. Later, the whole district adopted this experience and achieved great results. In the accusations of suffering, special attention should be paid to inspiring the backward masses, those who do not speak, and women to accuse of their suffering, so that the real problems can be discovered. Accounts that can be calculated must be calculated, and problems that can be solved must be solved. Clearing accounts and taking care of people must never be carried out at the same time, thorough clearing of accounts should be carried out first, and then care should be taken, otherwise it will restrain the masses and fail to achieve the goal of "leveling and making up the difference."
    [Report from Changzhi] In the second district of Changzhi, the investigation and rent reduction movement once caused panic among some middle peasants. Some old middle peasants were affected by the rumors of traitors and thought that when the landlords in the village were overthrown, leveling and making up the difference would be "leveling the middle peasants and making up the poor peasants." Many middle peasants closed their workshops, stopped production, and prepared to donate land. The district leadership clearly proposed that the direction of investigation and rent reduction was to eliminate feudal landlord exploitation, and instructed village cadres to go to the masses to patiently explain, eliminate the doubts in the minds of middle peasants, expose feudal landlords who concealed more than 30 acres of land by means of false separation of families, false gifting of land, false struggles, and joint business ventures, and conduct education among poor peasants on the great power of unity. After the ideological problems of the middle peasants were resolved, everyone clarified that leveling mainly meant cutting off the feudal tails. All the peasants immediately launched a new struggle. 200 new middle and poor peasant households and 110 old middle peasant households in Zhongcun were all involved in the movement.

　　涉县、长治经验：
    查减中更要团结中农
    【本报讯】涉县在半月查减中，已有七十六个村轰动起来。运动之猛烈、迅速、广泛，为已往所未有，据初步总结，获得经验如下：（一）打破干部自满思想。许多干部都认为：“咱们这是老区，经过几年查减，工作早搞好了！”因此在运动初，召开了积极分子训练班，用农民未彻底翻身的具体事例，纠正了干部自满思想。（二）划清农民阵线，肯定中贫农是一家人，争取百分之九十以上人的同情与拥护。地主封建势力，看到农民运动的蓬勃，即想尽各种办法来破坏，收买干部，假“开明”，疏散物资；另一方面威胁利诱基本群众，挑拨中贫农纠纷，企图破坏运动。此时在全体农民中进行阶级教育，十分重要，要具体的把中农划到农民方面来分清阵营，吸收其参加斗争，彻底纠正部分群众认为中农有些浮财（特别是生产发家的），不妨斗一下的思想，使地主完全孤立。如九区上清凉寺在明确了斗争对象后，广大中农拥入农会，由六十多人的农会，激增至一百四十多人。六区匡门在诉苦中十八个狗腿完全悔过坦白，并献出地主隐藏的东西。（三）启发诉苦清算，使群众自发的大动。有些村由于干部方式简单化，不从思想上发动群众，向地主诉苦说理，光单纯的要东西，结果只是干部裸体跳舞，地主也没斗倒，群众没认清向地主斗争是合理合法的，而采取袖手旁观的态度。反之二区石门在冬学中进行了思想教育，结果群众自发的诉起苦来，倒出了多年未倒的苦水。滩里村男人出差了，妇女在家自己进行斗争。九区西岗村由于在思想上发动的好，结果全村男女大动，把恶霸斗倒，后来全区都采用此经验，获得很大成绩。在诉苦中，应特别着重启发落后群众不吭气的人和妇女诉苦，如此才能真正发现问题所在。能算的账，一定要算，能解决的问题，一定要解决。清算照顾绝不能同时并进，应先彻底清算，然后照顾，否则会使群众束手束脚，达不到“填平补齐”的目的。
    【本报长治讯】长治二区在查减运动中，曾引起一部分中农恐慌，一部分旧中农受到奸特造谣影响，以为村里地主斗垮了，填平补齐，就是“平中农，补贫农”。许多中农把作坊歇业，不闹生产，准备献田。该区领导上明确提出查减方向是要消灭封建地主剥削，启发村干部到群众中去耐心解释，消除中农思想上的怀疑，揭露封建地主以假分家、假赠地假斗争，伙做买卖等方式，隐蔽土地三十多亩，并在贫农中进行团结力量大的教育。中农思想解决后，大家明确了填平主要是割掉封建尾巴。全体农民当即重新掀起斗争，中村二百户新中贫农和一百一十户老中农，全部卷入运动。（刘强、林堂、桑二则）
