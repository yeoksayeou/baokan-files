　　China and the Far East Conference Issues Letter to the Chinese People
    They will use all their strength
    To force the US government to stop aiding Chiang
    Friends of the liberated areas are expanding at home and abroad
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] Nanjing, 23rd dispatch: The "Letter to the Chinese People" passed by the China and Far East Conference, initiated by 198 US civic organizations and held in San Francisco from October 18th to 20th, was recently brought to Shanghai by an American expatriate and published in Chinese newspapers. The letter first stated: They will use all their strength to force the U.S. government to adjust its policy towards China. Regarding the domestic situation in China, the letter stated: "Many of you are living under the tyranny of the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, suffering a fate of hardship and sorrow. More and more American citizens are becoming aware of this situation. The situation in the CCP areas is vastly different. There, many of you are living under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the protection of brave people's armies; there, political, social, and economic democracy has been established, and the strength of a brand-new and powerful people's republic is growing, with friends expanding at home and abroad. All of this is becoming clearer and clearer to American citizens." The letter continued: The conference is taking the following four-point action program: (1) withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China; (2) stop military and economic aid to Chiang; (3) demand the earnest implementation of Truman's statement last December; (4) after implementing points one and two, the U.S. and the Soviet Union should conclude an agreement of non-interference in China's internal affairs. It also stated that the conference will take various steps to achieve the above goals. Important among these are: (1) sending the conference's resolutions to the leaders of various Chinese political groups; (2) urging churches and missionary organizations to assist the conference in achieving its goals; (3) organizing mass petition rallies, telegrams, and letter-writing campaigns; (4) requesting the 18th Congress to investigate the events of giving surplus materials and credit loans to Chiang Kai-shek; (5) requesting an immediate on-the-spot investigation of the current situation of the Chinese labor movement in order to provide assistance; (6) using the experiences of Chinese and Pacific veterans as educational materials and lecture scripts; (7) establishing a "speakers bureau" to convey the information obtained to American impartial organizations, which can all obtain services from the bureau; (8) sending the conference's resolutions to Truman, Byrnes, the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress, and other relevant agencies.
