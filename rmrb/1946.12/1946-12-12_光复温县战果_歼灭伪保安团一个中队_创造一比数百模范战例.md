    [This dispatch from our Changzhi office on the 6th] When our Daoqing Army Corps liberated Wen County on the 2nd, they annihilated a squadron of the Chiang Kai-shek's Wen County Security Regiment, capturing over a hundred enemy soldiers, seizing over forty rifles and pistols, and three small cannons. They also liberated over thirty of our active mass members from prison. Our side only suffered one injury. This created a model battle with a ratio of hundreds to one. Currently, there are no enemy traces east of the Qin (Yang) Meng (County) highway within the entire Wen County territory.
    Since the Qin River basin fell, the people on both sides of the Qin River have been living inhuman lives under the bloody rule of the Chiang army. Chiang Kai-shek's henchmen have implemented their so-called "uprooting" policy in the vast countryside, carrying out beastly massacres. In each village, at least five or six people were killed; the phenomenon of twenty or thirty people being killed in one village, or entire families being wiped out, was extremely common. According to incomplete statistics, the number of people killed in the area has reached four or five thousand. In Wen County alone, more than twenty outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation died under the butcher knife of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek every night. The corpses from the massacres were either thrown into the Qin River or abandoned in the wild. Now, corpses are strewn across both banks of the Qin River. During the day, crows gather to peck at the corpses, and at night, packs of dogs and wolves compete for food. Whenever the sun sets, no one can be seen on the road, and the scene is unspeakably tragic.
    In order to consolidate the city's defenses, more than 3,000 men and women were driven to repair the city walls every day. All materials were extorted from the people, the trees around the city were cut down, and many houses were demolished. Prices soared, and the masses complained incessantly. When our army entered the city this time, men, women, old and young were filled with a mixture of sorrow and joy, welcoming us on both sides of the road. The democratic government has now entered the city to work and is actively carrying out resettlement work.

    光复温县战果
    歼灭伪保安团一个中队
    创造一比数百模范战例
    【本报长治六日电】我道清兵团二日解放温县城时，歼灭蒋记温县保安团一个中队，计俘敌百余人，缴长短枪四十余支，小炮三门，并从狱中解放我群众积极分子三十余人，我仅负伤一人。创造一比数百战例。刻温县全境沁（阳）孟（县）公路以东已无敌踪。
    自沁河流域沦陷后，沁河两岸人民在蒋军血腥统治下，过着非人生活，蒋介石的爪牙们并在广大农村实行其所谓“斩草除根”政策，大肆兽性的屠杀，每村被杀者至少为五六人，一村被杀二、三十人及全家杀光的现象极为普遍。据不完全统计，该地被杀者已达四五千人，仅温县城内每夜必有廿余中华民族优秀的儿女死于卖国贼蒋介石的屠刀之下。惨杀之尸首或投入沁河或弃于野外，现沁河两岸横尸遍野，白昼乌鸦群集啄食，夜间犬狼结队夺食，每当夕阳西斜，路不见人，凄惨之情，不堪言状。
    为巩固城防每日驱策，三千余男女赶修城墙，一切材料均向人民勒索，城周树木砍光，民房多被拆毁，物价高涨，群众叫苦连天。此次我军进入该城时，男女老少悲喜交集，夹道欢迎。现该民主政府已入城办公，正积极进行安排善后工作。
