Combining Rectification and Organization to Develop the Militia
	Yaoshan Instructions on Inspection, Verification, and Reduction
[Report from our newspaper in Wei County on the 2nd] The old liberated area of Southern Hebei is conducting an in-depth inspection of the extent of land reform. The verification and reduction movement in most villages in Yaoshan is nearing its end; some villages are discussing the distribution of the fruits of the struggle, while others have already completed the distribution. In order to more fully mobilize the masses and thoroughly realize "land to the tiller," the County Committee recently issued instructions to each district, calling for a thorough check on the emancipation process: First, it must be clearly recognized in the cadres' minds that the work is not complete with the struggle against feudal landlords and local bullies. Was the struggle thorough? Were the masses mobilized sufficiently? Why, when the land problem is solved, are the masses not mobilized? Have more than 90% of the masses been united? Are there still undistributed fruits? All of these must be thoroughly inspected. The inspection must be combined with strengthening education, unfolding women's work, rectifying organizations, and developing the militia, so that peasants dare to engage in armed struggle against Chiang Kai-shek under any circumstances to defend the fruits of victory. The verification and reduction movement in the entire county of Jize is nearing its end. County cadres gathered to discuss conducting an in-depth inspection. The County Committee pointed out: First, in order to unite the majority, the land and property of the middle peasants that were struggled against during the struggle, or that the middle peasants "voluntarily" gave up, must be completely returned, explaining that middle peasants have no feudal exploitation and that poor and lower-middle peasants are one family, mobilizing the masses to discuss and clarify their thinking, paying attention to overcoming private feelings and sectarian struggles within the masses. Second, county and district cadres must conduct in-depth research and effectively lead the distribution of the fruits of the struggle, opposing the tendency to start strong and finish weak. Third, actively cultivate and absorb progressive elements with good backgrounds who emerged in the struggle to participate in village organizations, establish branches, village governments, farmers' associations, and militias. The methods are: 1. For old village cadres who have become detached from the masses in the past, education must be strengthened; those who do not change after education should be democratically re-elected according to the opinions of the masses. 2. The main village cadres (such as the village head and deputy head, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Farmers' Association, the militia captain, and the director of the Armed Forces Committee) must be held by honest, reliable, and well-respected good peasants.

　　结合整顿组织发展民兵
    尧山指示检查查减
    【本报威县二日电】冀南老区深入检查土地改革程度。尧山大部村庄的查减运动已近结束，有的村正在讨论分配果实，有的已经分配完毕。为更充分的发动群众，彻底实现耕者有其田，县委会顷向各区发出指示，号召进行翻身大检查：首先指出干部要在思想上明确认识，斗争了封建地主恶霸不算是工作完了，斗争的是否彻底？群众发动的是否充分；为什么土地问题解决了，群众发动不起来？是否团结了百分之九十以上群众？是否还有果实未分？都须要深入检查。并要结合检查，加强教育，展开妇女工作，整理组织，发展民兵，使农民在任何情况下敢于为保卫胜利果实和蒋介石作武装斗争。鸡泽全县查减运动接近结束，全县干部集会讨论进行深入检查，县委会指出：第一、为了团结多数，在斗争中把富中农斗争了的或是中农“自动”的土地和财物，一定要完全退回，说明中农没有封建剥削，中贫农是一家，发动群众讨论，打通思想，注意克服群众内部的私情与宗派斗争。第二、县区干部要深入研究，切实领导分配果实，反对虎头蛇尾的作风。第三、大量培养与吸收斗争中成份好的积极分子参加村组织，建立支部、村政权、农会和民兵。其办法：一、对过去脱离群众的老村干，要加强教育；教育不改者，依照群众意见，予以民主改选。二、主要村干部（如村长村副、农会正副主任、民兵队长、武委会主任），必须由老实可靠为群众拥护的好农民担任。
