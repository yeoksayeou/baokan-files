　　Model Bank Clerk
    Gao Qunxiao
    Li Lianqin
    Qunxiao is a burly, tall, dark, and stout young man with a strong Zanhuang accent. Judging by his appearance, one might think he is a rough and ready Zhang Fei, and that he would do things simply and crudely. In fact, it is not like that at all. He is a clerk in our Zanhuang branch, and a very careful and conscientious good comrade!
    As soon as he heard about going to the countryside to issue loans in conjunction with the emancipation movement, he packed his luggage and left. That evening, Zanhuang city was about to put on a show, and those who often go to the countryside would inevitably want to stay for the night to watch the performance, as this was a rare opportunity. Some clerks had already insisted on staying, but he saw that the needs of the masses for production were more important than his watching the show. Therefore, he did not even think about the show in his mind, but only thought: "I attended the branch manager's meeting, how can I implement that pile of policies for serving the masses? How can I get the loans into the hands of the basic masses and used for production? How can I promote the branch's policies to the village cadres and the masses?" These thoughts were swirling in his mind.
    Qunxiao issued loans alone in the Third District. He had never been a cashier and was not proficient at counting money. He thought: "Counting slowly will delay the masses' time, and counting quickly will cause mistakes, which would be bad." This made him feel difficult at once, because he started from being responsible to the masses and responsible to his work, so he finally created a good method: "He ran from the east village to the west village, from the south village to the north village, running tirelessly, and learned how much loan each village should get. At night, with the lights on, he counted each pile of money over and over again to make sure, and then wrote the village name and amount on each pile... Finally, he added up the piles and compared them with the amount he received from the branch before going to sleep. When the masses came to collect the money the next day, you see: "It's very fast, and there are no mistakes." Do you think this method is ordinary? I think it is very valuable. Without a heart for the people, there would be no creation.
    Once, it rained, not only was the road muddy, but there was also the danger of being soaked to the skin. However, the branch had an urgent matter to send someone to the sub-branch to deliver a letter. The sub-branch was stationed in Xingtai City, which was a full 140 li away from Zanhuang City. Many comrades said, "I can't go." You look at me, I look at you, no one dared to play a model role. Comrade Qunxiao thought this way: "Whether I can go or not does not depend on the weather, it depends on the work! Usually, everyone wants to go to Xingtai City, because there is a theater there, but it's not my turn, Qunxiao. This time I want to go." He carried his luggage and left.
    He trudged through the mud all the way to the sub-branch, and after delivering the letter, he still felt that a hope had not been fulfilled, and he was a little unhappy. His hope was not to watch a show, nor to take a bath, let alone that the reception was not warm. He said: "It's not easy for me to get to the sub-branch, the manager might want to talk to me, but unfortunately he went to the district branch for a meeting. I lost a hope, and the other comrades were very polite in letting me rest and drink water, but no one asked me how the work was going below? I don't hope for politeness, but I hope to talk about work and give me some ideas."

　　模范银行业务员
    高群小
    李连勤
    群小是一个外貌魁武，身材高大，黑而且胖的小伙子，满口赞皇腔，若从外貌看，一定是个活张飞，办事一定会简单粗糙，其实完全不是这样，他是我们赞皇支行的业务员，而且是一个很细心踏实的好同志啊！
    他一听说要结合翻身运动下乡贷款，打起行李就走，当晚赞皇城正要演戏，经常下乡的，免不了会留恋一晚上的看戏，因这是难得的机会，有的业务员已坚持留下来，但他看到群众生产的需要比他看戏更需要，所以他心里对戏连盘算都不盘算，只是想：“支行经理会议我参加了，那一堆为群众办事的方针，我如何去实现啊！款怎样放到基本群众手里和生产上呢？我怎样给村干部和群众宣传分行的方针？……”这些在他脑袋里旋转不休。
    群小一个人在三区放款，他没当过出纳员，对点票子不熟练，他想：“点慢了耽误群众时间，点快了出了岔子就不好了。”这一下子心里作难了，因他从对群众负责，对工作负责出发，所以终于创造了好办法：“他东村跑西村，南村跑北村，跑了个不休，各村应贷多少款都了解啦，晚上点着了灯，他一把一把地数了一遍又一遍，保险了，就在这一把上写个村名数目，在那一把上写个村名数目……最后将一把一把加起来和从支行领来的款对了，才睡了觉。到第二天群众领款时，你看：“快的很，又不错”，你说这个办法平凡吗？我觉得很可贵，没有为人民的心，就不会有创造。
    有一次下了雨，不仅路上泥滑，还有淋成水母鸡的危险。可是支行的紧急事要派人到分行送信，分行在邢台市驻，离赞皇城足有一百四十里路，不少同志说：“不能去。”你看我，我瞧你，谁也不敢来个模范作用。群小同志这样想：“能去不能去不决定于天，决定于工作呀！平时大都愿到邢台市去，因那里有戏园，轮不着我群小，这次我要去。”他背着行李就走了。
    他一路泥泞跋涉到了分行，交了信件后还有一个希望感觉没有达到，心里有些不高兴，他的希望不是看戏也不是洗澡，更不是招待不亲热，他说：“好容易我到了分行，经理可能找我谈谈，不巧他到区行开会了，失了一个望，其他各位同志们让休息喝水，倒很客气，但没一个人问问我在下边工作如何？我不是希望客气，而是希望谈谈工作，给我些办法。”
