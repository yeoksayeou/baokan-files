Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 8th: New York dispatch: The Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has completed discussions on the Five-Nation Treaty. During the meetings of the four foreign ministers on the 5th, 6th, and 7th, the Trieste issue and the freedom of navigation on the Danube River reached final agreement, and the proposals submitted by experts regarding the management of railway transportation and the freedom of civil aviation within the Free Territory of Trieste were accepted. All previously unresolved issues in the Five-Nation Treaty have been resolved, and the four foreign ministers have ordered their assistants to begin drafting the final text of the Five-Nation Treaty based on the agreement. Byrnes had suggested signing the treaty in New York before Christmas, but due to some technical issues that still need to be resolved, it was decided to formally sign the treaty between February 1st and 15th next year. After their intensive work, the four foreign ministers are taking a day off today and are scheduled to begin preliminary discussions on the German treaty issue on the 9th.
