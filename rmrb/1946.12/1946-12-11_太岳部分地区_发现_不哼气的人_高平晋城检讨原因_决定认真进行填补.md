    Gaoping and Jincheng Review Causes
    Decide to Seriously Rectify
    [This newspaper’s Taiyue dispatch, 9th] During the mass movement this winter in the entire region, many areas have discovered "people who don't make a sound." These people aren't necessarily without suffering or unable to speak, but are mostly worried ideologically, or become depressed due to unfair distribution of fruits of labor. According to the investigations in Gaoping and Jincheng, there are three reasons: (1) Shackled by ideas of a change of regime. Han Lixing of Xianjing Village, Gaoping, was oppressed by a major tyrant and exploited by usurious lending, leading to his ruin, but he has yet to propose interest reduction. He is scared by rumors from special agent Qin Dexian and others, fearing future retribution. (2) The leadership does not show enough concern for the suffering of every member of the masses, and even fails to resolve problems, limiting the thorough airing of grievances and digging up the roots of poverty by the masses. Han Xueyu's wife from Donggou Village, Jincheng, was forcibly taken by Xu Liugou, a puppet village policeman during the Japanese occupation, who also seized most of their grain and cloth. Han had raised the issue several times, but the cadres treated it as an individual matter and did not resolve it. "Little Black Dog" from Xianjing Village, Gaoping, borrowed a dou of rice from a landlord during a famine year, resulting in two buildings being seized. He brought it up for resolution, but the cadres said it couldn't be counted because there were no written documents. He was so angry that he cried, and stopped speaking at meetings. (3) Unfair distribution of the fruits of labor. When distributing the fruits of labor in Xianjing Village, Gaoping, cadres, activists, military dependents, and poor peasants were divided into four classes. Some people met all four conditions, so they received four shares of the fruits of labor, causing much dissatisfaction among the masses, who said: "Now it is capable people who are turning over, not poor people." Currently, various places are planning to eliminate the phenomenon of "people who don't make a sound," mobilizing the entire masses to truly level up and fill in the gaps, and realize land to the tillers.

    太岳部分地区
    发现“不哼气的人”
    高平晋城检讨原因
    决定认真进行填补
    【本报太岳九日电】在冬季全区群众运动中，不少地区发现“不哼气的人”，他们并非无苦或不会说话，乃多系思想有顾虑，或因果实分配不公趋于消沉。据高平、晋城的检查，原因有三种：（一）被变天思想束缚。高平仙井村韩利星被大恶霸压迫，受高利盘剥，弄得倾家荡产，但至今尚未提出减息。他被特务秦德先等谣言吓住，恐怕将来倒算。（二）领导上关心每个群众的痛苦不够，甚至有问题不予解决，限制了群众的彻底诉苦挖穷根。晋城东沟村韩学愈老婆，日本人在时被伪村警徐六狗强霸去，并攫去大部粮食与布匹，韩曾几次提出，干部当作个别问题未予解决。高平仙井村“小黑狗”，灾荒年间借了地主一斗米，结果两座楼房被霸去，他提出来要解决，干部认为没有文据不能算，他气的大哭，开会时不再说话了。（三）分配果实不公。高平仙井村分果实时划分干部、积极分子、军属、贫农四等，某些人四个条件都够，便分得四份果实，引起很多群众不满，说：“现在是能人翻身，不是穷人翻身”。现各地正计划消灭不哼气的现象，发动全体群众真正填平补齐，实现耕者有其田。
