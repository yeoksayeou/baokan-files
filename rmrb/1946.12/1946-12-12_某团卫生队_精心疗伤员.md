[Our Newspaper's Frontline Reporters in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Area, 9th] The medical team of a certain regiment has excellent work order and takes very good care of the wounded. After each number is called, the first group consists of two small caregivers: one holding a basin and the other wiping faces. Based on the severity of the injuries, doctors or head nurses provide care. Then the water feeding team feeds rice soup. After these few procedures are completed, they register the patient and then stretcher bearers carry them away. Whether it is crowded or leisurely, this process is always orderly, as nimble and accurate as a machine. Comrades Wu Zhigao, the head of the medical team, personally treats the particularly seriously wounded. The reporter personally witnessed him carefully examining the body of a martyred comrade, hoping to find a glimmer of hope. He looked again and again but did not find any fatal wounds; however, the injured person had indeed been dead for about ten minutes. He finally made a diagnosis, and then this young body was carried into the house, covered with a quilt, and a fire was lit to keep it warm. Before long, the "body" he had painstakingly tried to save spoke, speaking very vaguely, like a dream, and its hand was also moving. "How dangerous! It was almost over!" Captain Wu said to himself. This was indeed his victory and glory. If it weren't for his love for the wounded and his careful diagnosis, what would we have thought the outcome would be?

    某团卫生队
    精心疗伤员
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团九日电】某团卫生队，工作秩序良好，看护伤员十分周到，每一个彩号下来之后，第一组两个小看护；一个端盆，一个擦脸；按轻重决定，由医生或看护班长分别救护。接着喂水组喂米汤。几个手续作完后，就登记，再由担架抬走。无论拥挤或松闲，这个步骤始终不乱，活像一部机器似的敏捷而准确。特重彩号由卫生队长吴志高同志亲自动手救治。记者亲自看他在慎重的检查一个牺牲同志的遗体，以冀发现一线的希望。他看了又看，没发现致死的创伤；但伤者又确是死了十来分钟的样子，他最后下了诊断，于是这个年青的遗体被抬进房子，盖上被子，烧起火来取暖。不一会，他所精心挽救的“遗体”说话了，说得很含糊，像梦呓一样，手也在动弹。“好危险！差一点就完了！”吴队长自言自语的说着，这确是他的胜利和光荣。倘若不是他对伤员的热爱和精心的诊断，我们会想到一个什么结果呢？
