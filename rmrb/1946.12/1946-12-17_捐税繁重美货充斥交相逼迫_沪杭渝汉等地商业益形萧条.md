Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 13th: According to news reports from various places in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, commerce in various regions is becoming increasingly depressed. Bankruptcies of shops in Shanghai continue incessantly. At the beginning of this month, a relatively large company declared liquidation due to losses of 300 million yuan. It is generally expected that three to four thousand factories and shops in Shanghai will close down by the end of the year. The situation in Suzhou and Hangzhou, known as "paradise on earth," is even more miserable. In Suzhou, businesses are closing their doors and nine out of ten houses are empty. Newspapers are filled with liquidation advertisements. In a little over a month, more than 110 shops have closed down. In Hangzhou, since the implementation of goods taxation in October, 28 tea shops alone have closed down in just over a month. In addition, the number of bankruptcies in industries such as cloth, silk, and grain in October, already registered with the municipal government, has reached 24. Yanling Road in Hangzhou, famous as a "world of food," now sees large and small restaurants with few customers. Cooks and waiters stand at the door chatting, and sometimes even the fire in the stove is extinguished. In the Sanyuanfang area, silk shops fly banners advertising big sales and price reductions all day long, and radios emit tempting sounds, but no one enters. As for Hankou, a major town connecting Western China and the coast, it is showing signs of collapse. The wave of bankruptcies in export commerce this summer averaged one every two days, but by October the situation was far worse. From October 15th to 20th, 117 companies and shops closed down in just five days, an average of 23 closures per day. From the 20th to the 25th, more than 30 more followed suit. Chongqing, the economic center of Southwest China, has been hit even harder by the commercial panic. Since the beginning of autumn, more than 3,000 large businesses and over 4,000 small shops have closed down. The owner of Sutaiji and Lao Daoxiangcun, confectionery businesses, compared a box of Chinese fruit canned goods and a box of American canned goods, telling reporters: "One price is 3,200 yuan, and the other is 3,500 yuan, but the American one has twice the quantity and the quality is of course much better. What can we do?" The owner of Likehao, a department store, said: "Business is very sluggish. We used to sell more than one million yuan every day, but now it's hard to sell even ten or twenty thousand yuan. There is no business, but we still have to pay income tax, business tax, goods tax, house donations, and expenses for the National Guard. How can we maintain this?" The owner of a silver furnace shop on Minzu Road said: "Now everyone doesn't even have food to eat, who will sell gold? In the past two months, more than 20 of our colleagues have closed down." The owner of Juliheng, a native cloth business, told reporters: "Our native cloth is the worst. We used to sell ten or twenty thousand yuan every day, but now two or three thousand yuan is good, or sometimes we don't even sell ten thousand yuan a day. It's really infuriating!"

　　捐税繁重美货充斥交相逼迫  沪杭渝汉等地商业益形萧条
    【新华社延安十三日电】据各地报纸电讯消息：近来蒋区各地商业益形萧条。上海商店倒号事件继续不断，本月初即为数较大公司亏累三亿元而宣告清理。一般预料年终时沪市有三四千家工厂商店倒闭。号称天堂的苏杭两地景况更为惨凉。苏州百业闭门，十室九空，各报上充满清理广告，一月多来商店倒闭已达一百一十余家。杭州自从十月间实行货物征税后，一月多光景单茶行倒闭者就有二十八家。此外如布、绸、粮食等各业，十月份倒闭数经已在市政府备案者已达二十四家。杭市以“吃的世界”闻名的延龄路，现在大酒与小菜店都是门可罗雀。厨子、堂倌都站在门口聊天，有时灶下连火星都熄灭了。三元坊一带的绸缎店成天吹吹打打大减价的旗帜满街飘，无线电也放出诱人的音波，却无人进门。至于联络华西与沿海的重镇——汉口，已呈现溃灭征候。今夏出口商业的一度倒风不过平均每两天倒一家，到十月份已远非昔比，十月十五日到二十日五天中，全已倒闭。公司行店即达一百一十七家，平均每天倒闭二十三家，以上从二十到二十五日还有三十多家跟着倒闭。西南经济中心的重庆所受商业恐慌之袭击，尤为惨重。自入秋以来共倒闭了大型商号三千余家。小型商店四千余家，糖果业苏泰记老稻香村的老板，拿了一盒中国水果罐头和一盒美国罐头相比对记者说：“一个价钱是三千二，一个价钱是三千五，但美国的要比中国的量多一倍，质当然也好的多，你看如何得了！”百货业利可号的老板说：“生意清淡的很，以前每天卖百多万元，现在每天卖十来万都吃力，没得生意，但还得出所利得税、营业税、货物税、房捐，出国民兵警备队的费用，这样怎样维持呢？”民族路一家银炉业老板说：“现在大家饭都没得吃，谁来卖金子呢？最近两月，我们同业就倒闭了二十多家。”土布业聚利恒老板告诉记者：“我们土布最惨，以前每天卖十来万的，现在每天两三万就不错了，或者一天卖不到一万块钱，说起来硬是气呵！”
