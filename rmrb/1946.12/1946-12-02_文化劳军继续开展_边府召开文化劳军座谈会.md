　　Cultural Support for the Army Continues
    Border Region Government Holds Symposium on Cultural Support for the Army
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The cultural support for the army movement in the Border Region has been widely launched in various cultural departments. The book and newspaper donation movement initiated by the New Masses Press has now increased from 170,000 yuan (as reported in this newspaper on the 24th) to over 200,000 yuan. The bookstore has distributed over 2,000 books and newspapers. They presented the newly purchased deluxe edition of "History of the Russian Civil War" from Shandong to Commander Liu at the front. In addition to soliciting donations for books and newspapers from students' parents, teachers at Yangyi Elementary School also conducted propaganda at lively markets, creating a surge of enthusiasm for supporting the army. Liberated peasants enthusiastically donated money to purchase books and newspapers to donate to the front.
    Furthermore, the Education Department of the Border Region Government, in order to expand the scope of book and newspaper support for the army and mobilize cultural figures throughout the region to serve the front lines, held a symposium on cultural support for the army on the 28th. They called on all sectors to widely carry out book and newspaper support for the army and to create works needed by the soldiers at the front. At the meeting, Comrade Ren Baige of the Political Department of the Military Region explained that frontline soldiers and wounded personnel urgently need cultural nourishment during every lull in the war. In addition to mobilizing the propaganda and education departments of the troops to publish books and newspapers to solve part of the problem, it is necessary to expand the scope of publicity and condolences and mobilize a large number of cultural figures and drama workers to go to the front. Comrade Ai Yan reflected that frontline soldiers welcomed the people's painters, drama workers, and journalists to the patriotic war front with the greatest enthusiasm. He cited many people's heroes on the front line who gave all their money to the public and bravely charged forward with the portraits given to them by war correspondents. At the meeting, everyone unanimously suggested that the government organize folk troupes and folk artists to conduct support performances in rear hospitals and mobilize a large number of cultural figures to serve the front from Northern University and various cultural institutions and organizations. The Border Region Government's Cultural Award Review Committee will also treat realistic works praising the patriotic war as one of the evaluation criteria.
