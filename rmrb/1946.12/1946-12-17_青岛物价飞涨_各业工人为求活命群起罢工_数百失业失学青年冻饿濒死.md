Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 13th: Soaring prices have forced workers in all trades in Qingdao to strike. According to the Nanjing Dagang Daily: All 700-plus male and female workers of the Qingdao Dongya Tobacco Company, under the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Chiang government, have been on strike since the 14th of last month. Many workers told reporters: "Our only demand is to have enough to eat and survive." All the workers of the Sixth Factory of the Song Ziwen bureaucratic-capitalist China Textile Corporation also issued a letter to compatriots from all walks of life for the sake of workers being able to eat their fill. They said: "We are unwilling to starve ourselves while watching the rich live in extravagance." All printing workers in Qingdao went on strike on the 14th of last month due to unsuccessful demands for wage increases. From the 15th, all barbershops in the city were closed all day. The barbers unanimously refused to work. On that day, the United Barbers Union held its first representative conference in the Citizen's Auditorium, resolving to demand improved treatment and that working hours should not exceed ten hours per day.

According to a Central News Agency report: Approximately 8,000 impoverished students who fled to Qingdao and are now out of school and unemployed have requested relief from the Chiang government, but have not received any results. Now that the severe winter has arrived, they have no food, clothing, or shelter. On the night of the 8th, a cold wave struck, and the temperature dropped sharply to minus eight degrees. More than two hundred of them were lying unconscious on the streets due to freezing and starvation. Their condition was extremely tragic, but the Kuomintang authorities turned a deaf ear.

    数百失业失学青年冻饿濒死
    【新华社延安十三日电】物价飞涨，已迫使青岛各业工人起而罢工。据南京大刚报载：蒋政府经济部所属青岛东亚烟草公司全体七百余男女工人，已自上月十四日起罢工。很多工友对记者说：“我们唯一的要求，是吃得饱活下去。”宋子文官僚资本的中纺公司第六厂全体工人，也为了工人要吃饱饭而发表告各界同胞书，他们说：“我们不愿意自己饿了肚皮，却看着有钱人穷奢极侈。”青市全市印刷工人因要求增资不遂，已自上月十四日起罢工。十五日起全市理发店门扉整日关闭，理发工人一致拒绝上工，是日理发业联工会在市民礼堂召开第一次代表大会，决议要求提高待遇，并要求每天工作不超过十小时。
    【本报讯】据中央社讯：各地流亡青岛失学失业之贫苦学生约八千余人，曾请求蒋政府予以救济，迄未获结果。目前严冬届临，渠等衣、食、住均无着路。八日夜晚，寒流侵袭，温度骤降至零下八度，渠等露宿街头因冻饿而失去知觉者达二百余人，其状甚惨，但国民党当局置若惘闻。
