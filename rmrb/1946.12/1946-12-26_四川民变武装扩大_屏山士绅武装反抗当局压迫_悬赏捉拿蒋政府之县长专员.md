Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 23rd: According to news from local newspapers in Chengdu and Chongqing, peasant uprising forces in various parts of Sichuan Province have been growing stronger throughout November. Local gentry have also organized armed resistance. Some local grassroots military and political cadres of the Chiang government are reportedly colluding with the rebels.

The Pingshan County peasant uprising force led by Hu Guoguang in southwestern Sichuan has expanded to over 3,000 people. They have joined forces with the local farmer-organized armed religious group, the "Big Sword Society," creating a powerful movement. Hu is a local gentry member from Pingshan. Years ago, after his father was murdered, he and his two brothers organized an armed group to avenge his father's death. They had nicknames such as "Big Chili" (a type of Sichuan pepper), "Small Chili," and "July Chili." Later, they disarmed and returned home, where Hu became a Pingshan County Councilor. Recently, the government accused him and his brothers of communicating with rebels in the Jinsha River and Min River areas and sent a team to arrest them. Hu Guoguang fled upon hearing the news, and his brother "Small Chili" was stabbed to death with knives at his home in Longhua Township. Hu Guoguang continues to gather people to resist and has offered a reward of two million to capture the special commissioner of the region and one million to capture the county magistrate. The force initially had only a few hundred people but has now grown to over three thousand. Last month, the Chiang government dispatched a battalion of troops from Yibin County to "suppress" them, but failed.

Peasant uprising forces in Yibin County are also very active, often operating in the suburbs and urban areas. One group of several dozen people, led by Zhao Zizhang, is entirely composed of plainclothes men with short guns. On the 10th of last month, over a hundred rebels engaged in a fierce battle with the "Joint Defense Team" in Wujianfang of the county for several hours, killing and wounding many government soldiers.

To the south of Yibin, the peasant uprising force led by Yin Lucai in Qi County has reached 400 men with guns. On October 29th, they engaged in a fierce battle with over 500 members of the Qi County team led by Qi County Magistrate Wang Pengshan in Fuxing Township of the county, as well as a company of Chiang's army sent from Yunnan. The Qi County team alone suffered 11 dead and wounded. Yin's force has now moved to the Daxue Mountain area on the Yunnan border.

According to the *West China Daily*, "local township government personnel in Yibin, Nanxi, and Qingfu counties are colluding with bandits." As a result, the "Joint Defense Office of the Three Counties" strangled Li Chipin, an associate from Zhonglu Township in Nanxi, and forced Zhou Laichuan, the township head of Maxiang, to flee.

The rebels in the Jialing River area are gradually consolidating their position. One group of over 200 men with guns in the Zhaohua County area has already established a tax checkpoint on the river last month. Vessels that refuse to pay are only detained.

The leader of the rebels in Wuxi and Yunyang areas of eastern Sichuan is Xiao Minghuang. As of last month, his force has grown to several hundred people, operating in Liuye Township, which belongs to Fengjie County, and using Dazhaizi, located between Yunyang and Fengjie, as their base.

    【新华社延安二十三日电】据蓉渝地方报消息：四川各地民变武装势力，十一月愈益增长，地方士绅亦组织武装反抗。蒋政府地方基层军政干部，颇有与变民互通声气者。川西南屏山县民变胡国光部已发展至三千余人，与当地农民组成的武装宗教团体，大刀队联合，声势日震。胡为屏山地方士绅，早年因父亲被人杀害，兄弟三人曾组织武装，图报父仇。有“大海椒”（四川辣椒之一种）、“小海椒”、“七月椒”之绰号，后解甲回家担任屏山县参议员。近因政府谓渠兄弟与金沙江、岷江一带变民往来，派队缉捕，胡国光闻讯出走，其弟“小海椒”于其龙华市家中被乱刀刺死。胡国光仍聚众反抗，并悬赏二百万捕拿该区专员，一百万捕拿该县县长。该部初仅数百人，目前增至三千余。上月蒋政府由宜宾县派兵一营，前往“镇剿”，未能得逞。宜宾县民变武装亦极活跃，常活动于城郊与城区，其中有赵子章率领之一部数十人，全系便衣短枪。上月十日有变民百余，在该县五间坊与“联防队”激战数小时，毙伤城兵多名。宜宾以南琪县之变民殷禄才部，人枪已达四百，十月二十九日，曾于该县复兴乡之王朋山琪县县长率领之团队五百余，及云南派来之蒋军一个连一度激战，仅琪县团队即被毙伤十一名，现殷部转移滇境大雪山一带活动。据华西日报称：宜宾、南溪、庆符三县“各地乡政人员有与匪勾结情事”，“三县联防处”曾因此而将南溪众卢乡附李池品勒死，逼走马乡乡长周赉川。嘉陵江一带的变民，地位渐趋稳固，其中昭化县境一部人枪二百余，上月已在江上设立税卡，往来船只抗不缴费者，仅予扣留处分。川东巫溪、云阳一带之变民领袖为萧鸣凰，截至上月，已发展至数百人，活动于奉节县属六也乡，以云阳奉节间之大寨子地方为根据地。
