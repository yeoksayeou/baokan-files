　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th. According to news agency reports, battles occurred in two locations in Vietnam on the 17th. One was near the Hanoi power plant, provoked by French tanks. The Vietnamese army used fierce firepower to prevent the French army from advancing. Afterwards, the battle temporarily ceased due to negotiations between the two sides. However, fighting resumed at night and did not stop until the morning of the 18th. The other was in the Cu Chi district, 30 kilometers northwest of Saigon in Cochinchina, where four companies of the French army launched an attack under the guise of "patrols," engaging in fierce fighting with 300 Vietnamese soldiers. The French army retreated after suffering seven casualties.

　　越南法军挑衅
    【新华社延安十九日电】据各通讯社报导：十七日越南两地发生战事。其一在河内电力厂附近，由法方战车挑衅引起，越军以猛烈的火力阻止法军前进，其后因双方谈判，战事暂止，惟夜间战事又起，迄十八日晨未停。另一在交趾支那西贡西北三十公里的古奇区，法军四个连以“巡查”名义出击，与三百越军发生激战，法军于阵亡七名后撤退。
