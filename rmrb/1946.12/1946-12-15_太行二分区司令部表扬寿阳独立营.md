    Taihang Second Military Subdistrict Headquarters Commends Shouyang Independent Battalion
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch of the 10th] The Taihang Second Military Subdistrict Headquarters recently issued a circular commending the Shouyang Independent Battalion for annihilating the Sixth Company of the Yan pseudo-security 24th Regiment on the 29th of last month with a brilliant record of zero casualties versus seventy (the previous telegraphic draft mistakenly stated ninety), praising them as the "banner of guerrilla warfare in central Shanxi," and awarding them 10,000 yuan and rewarding the participating troops. The circular stated: "This time, the Shouyang Independent Battalion created a brilliant battle example of zero casualties versus seventy at an extremely small cost, which is the result of the commanders and fighters' devotion to serving the people and their high degree of political tenacity. It is hoped that all our troops will work hard to learn from them, grasp the enemy's weaknesses, and make persistent efforts to achieve more and greater victories."
