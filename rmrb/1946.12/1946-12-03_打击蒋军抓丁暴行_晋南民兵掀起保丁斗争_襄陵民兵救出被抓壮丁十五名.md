Fighting Chiang Kai-shek's Army's Atrocious Conscription Practices
　　The Jinnan Militia Launch a Struggle to Protect Conscripts
　　Xiangling Militia Rescue Fifteen Conscripts
[This newspaper's Taiyue 22nd dispatch] Since the Chiang Kai-shek army invaded our area in early July, after five months of our self-defense counterattack, Chiang Kai-shek himself lost a huge amount of his own vital strength, and recently transferred troops to attack Yan'an. The Chiang Kai-shek army in southern Shanxi was therefore not strong enough, and followed the old tricks of the Japanese invaders of "using war to support war," and massively captured men in southern Shanxi and northern Henan. In the five counties of Quwo, Xiangling, Hongdong, Fushan, and Jiangxian alone, more than 1,600 people have been captured. People everywhere have brought their sons and daughters to the liberated areas to seek assistance. The militias in the border areas immediately launched attacks to combat the Chiang Kai-shek army's conscription conspiracy, and launched a struggle to protect conscripts. At the beginning of last month, the Xiangling militia twice defeated the Chiang Kai-shek army that was capturing conscripts in Hou Village, rescuing fifteen conscripts. Significant results were also achieved in other areas, and Chiang Kai-shek's conscription plan was defeated. From the 20th onwards, the Chiang Kai-shek army held "peace conferences" in various villages, spreading a "peaceful" atmosphere to lure the masses back home in order to capture them in large numbers, but this conspiracy was immediately seen through by the local masses, who took the opportunity to flee to the liberated areas in large numbers, and the democratic governments in various places gave them enthusiastic condolences and resettlement respectively.

    【本报太岳二十二日电】蒋军自七月初进犯我区，经我五个月的自卫反击，蒋自己丧失巨大有生力量，近又抽调兵力进攻延安，晋南蒋军兵力因而不够分配，效法日寇“以战养战”故技，在晋南及豫北各地，大肆捕捉壮丁。仅曲、襄、洪、浮、绛五县已被捕捉去一千六百余人，各地群众纷纷扶儿携女，逃来解放区，请求援助。边沿区民兵当即分别出击，打击蒋军捕丁阴谋，掀起保丁斗争。上月初襄陵民兵在侯村两次击溃捕丁蒋军，救出壮丁十五名，其他各地亦获得重大效果，蒋军捕丁计划遂告失败。从二十日起蒋军又在各村召开“和平会议”，散布“和平”空气，引诱群众回家，以便大量捕捉，但这一阴谋立被当地群众识破，并乘机大批逃来解放区，各地民主政府即分别给予热情慰问与安置。
