Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 17th: According to incomplete statistics, the recent self-defense achievements of the local armed forces and militia guerrillas in the Jinji Luyu Border Region are as follows: In the Jilu Yu area, from the 15th of last month to the 1st of this month, 41 attacks were launched within half a month. In Taihang, from late October to the end of November, there were over 300 battles in 40 days. In Taiyue, there were over 20 battles on November 1st. In total, 5,456 Chiang troops were killed or wounded, 2,490 were captured alive, and 41 artillery pieces and grenade launchers of various calibers, 86 light and heavy machine guns, and 345 long and short rifles and automatic rifles were seized. The area of activity of the Jilu Yu guerrillas extends all the way to the far rear of the Chiang army. On the 19th of last month, Zaoziji in Boxian County, Suluwan, was recovered. Another guerrilla unit advanced into Baima Village east of Huangchuan City in southern Henan, ambushing the 1st General Team of the 5th Special District of Chiang Kai-shek, killing one Chiang army platoon leader and one squad leader, and capturing 52 people including the company commander and below.

This newspaper, Changzhi, 15th: According to preliminary statistics, the local regiments, guerrillas, and militia in various parts of Taihang have launched more than 10 active attacks in the ten days from the 1st to the 10th of this month, killing more than 110 enemy soldiers below the company commander level, capturing 56 enemy soldiers, and seizing 2 machine guns and 84 rifles. It seriously struck the Chiang's puppet troops who were nibbling and grabbing recruits, and defended the interests of the masses. In northern Henan, a certain unit of ours fiercely attacked the Chiang army entrenched in Zhanggongyuan, Tangyin on the night of the 3rd, killing or wounding 10 enemies and capturing 7 enemy puppets (including the secret service chief Sun Shouli), seizing 2 enemy rifles, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and a part of supplies. That night, Li, the district chief of Tangyin District, also led an armed work team to cooperate with the army to capture secret service "homecoming corps", launching a political offensive in the Chiang-occupied area, which greatly excited the masses. On the 4th, a certain unit of ours intercepted the invading enemy in Shangnanwang Town, west of Wen County, killing more than 10 enemies, capturing 2 people, and seizing 4 rifles and more than 300 rounds of ammunition. On the evening of the 6th, a certain unit of ours captured Majie Town, north of Xiuwu City, killing or wounding more than 30 Chiang's puppet troops, capturing 37 alive, and seizing 1 light machine gun and more than 50 rifles. On the 9th, our army in Anyang ambushed the invading enemy at Xiapo, southwest of Shuiye, killing more than 20 enemies. On the Zhengtai front, on the 2nd, a certain unit of ours ambushed in Yunyan, killing 2 enemies who invaded from Duanting Railway Station and capturing 13 alive. On the 4th, our × unit, in conjunction with the militia, killed 25 enemy soldiers below the company commander level in Donghui Village, Pingding, captured 3 alive, and seized 4 rifles and 1 light machine gun. The 18 head of livestock, more than 60 stones of grain and clothing, etc., that were robbed from the masses were all intercepted and returned to the masses.

This newspaper, Changzhi, 16th: The militia of Pingding County in Taihang fought 270 battles with the enemy in three months (from September to November), killing 167 enemies and wounding 172 enemies (mine warfare results not included), seizing 6 rifles, 6,264 rounds of ammunition, 118 grenades, and more than 900 jin of wire. In the three months of self-defense operations, militia heroes emerged in large numbers. For example, when Shi Liuhai, a militiaman from Jiangjunya, was surrounded by the enemy, he bravely rolled to the landmine and triggered it with his body, killing four enemies, and he also gloriously sacrificed himself. Guo Fuchang, the director of the Armed Forces Committee of Guojiakou Village, failed to break through, killed two enemies with a bayonet, and then used grenades to kill or wound eleven enemies. Finally, he was outnumbered and heroically sacrificed.
