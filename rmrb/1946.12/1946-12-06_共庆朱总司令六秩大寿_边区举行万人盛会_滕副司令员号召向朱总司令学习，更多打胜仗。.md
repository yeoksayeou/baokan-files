　　Celebrating Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Sixtieth Birthday
  　Border Region Holds Mass Rally of Ten Thousand People
  　Deputy Commander Teng Calls for Learning from Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Winning More Battles.
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] On December 3rd, cadres from various directly affiliated organs in the border region and masses from nearby villages held a grand gathering of ten thousand people at their respective locations to celebrate Commander-in-Chief Zhu's sixtieth birthday. The venue was filled with congratulatory poems and telegrams. The large red banners from the military region headquarters and political department read, "Destroy ten more brigades of Chiang's troops as a birthday gift to Commander-in-Chief Zhu." The border region government's congratulatory message read, "Work hard, support the front lines, and celebrate your sixtieth birthday." The platform was laden with longevity peaches and noodles presented by liberated peasants, and fat pigs and sheep sent by various organs. On the horizontal banner adorned with gold stars, Commander-in-Chief's portrait appeared even more amiable today. His gaze, which warmed everyone, was smilingly reviewing the entire audience.
    At noon, the vast venue was already packed with masses who had come from afar to offer congratulations. The conference opened amidst melodious music. Deputy Commander Teng of the military region walked towards the platform amidst thunderous applause. He represented all the Eighth Route Army troops in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area in congratulating the Commander-in-Chief with the glorious achievements of the patriotic self-defense war over the past four and a half months. He said, "In the past four and a half months, our Eighth Route Army in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area has eliminated seventeen brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's regular army in twenty-three major self-defense battles (loud applause), killing and wounding more than 28,000 Chiang's troops, capturing a Chiang's division commander, five brigade commanders, fifteen regimental commanders, and over 50,000 officers and soldiers. In the recent self-defense operations in southwestern Shanxi, we also captured Yan's army commander-in-chief, Yang Chengyuan. We have successively seized eighteen tanks, twenty-one mountain guns, eight American-style howitzers, fifteen anti-tank guns, eight rocket launchers, five Type 92 guns, seven hundred and eighty-four other light and heavy mortars and small guns, more than two thousand five hundred light and heavy machine guns, and nearly 30,000 rifles. Although Chiang's troops have occupied twenty-nine of our county towns, because Chiang's troops' strength has been annihilated, we have recently recovered several county towns. As long as we eliminate a few more of his brigades, we can stop his offensive and launch a counter-offensive to recover all lost territories." Before he could finish speaking, the slogans "Celebrate Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Sixtieth Birthday" and "Destroy Seventeen More Brigades of Chiang's Troops" resounded again. Finally, Deputy Commander Teng called on everyone to learn from Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The regular army should win more battles, eliminate the enemy, and widely develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines to cooperate with the main forces. The rear should conduct large-scale military training, thoroughly implement land reform, and fully support the front lines. During the New Year this year, we will eliminate three or four more brigades of Chiang's troops to welcome 1947." (The audience applauded and cheered).

　　共庆朱总司令六秩大寿
  　边区举行万人盛会
  　滕副司令员号召向朱总司令学习，更多打胜仗。
    【本报特讯】十二月三日，边区直属各机关干部，附近各村庄群众，在其驻地，举行盛大的万人集会，庆祝朱总司令六十寿辰。会场四周满布着祝祠贺电。军区司令部，政治部的大红幛上写着“再消灭蒋军十个旅献给朱总司令作为祝寿的礼物”。边区政府的贺祠写着“努力工作，支援前线，来庆祝您的六十大寿”。主席台上摆满了翻身农民献来的寿桃、寿面，各机关送来的肥猪肥羊。在缀着金星的寿字横帐上，总司令肖像今天显得更加慈祥了。他那任何人都感到温暖的目光，在微笑着检阅着全场。
    正午，广大的会场，已为远道赶来祝贺的群众挤满了。大会在悠扬的乐声中揭幕。军区滕副司令员在雷动的掌声中走向主席台，他代表晋冀鲁豫全体八路军，以四个半月来的爱国自卫战争的辉煌战绩来给总司令祝寿。他说：“四个半月来，我们晋冀鲁豫区的八路军，在二十三次主要的自卫战斗中，已消灭蒋介石正规军十七个旅（大鼓掌），毙伤蒋军两万八千余人，生俘蒋军一个师长，五个旅长，十五个团长，及以下官兵五万余人。最近晋西南自卫作战中，又将阎军一位总司令杨澄源捉住了。先后共缴坦克十八辆，山炮二十一门，美式榴弹炮八门，战防炮十五门，火箭炮八门，九二式炮五门，其他轻重迫击炮小炮七百八十四门，轻重机枪两千五百三十余挺，步枪近三万支。蒋军虽然占领了我们二十九个县城，但由于蒋军有生力量被歼灭，最近我们已收复了的座县城，只要我们再消灭他几个旅，我们就可以停止他的进攻，并实行反攻，收复一切失地”。他的话还未讲完，“庆祝朱总司令六十大寿”，“再消灭蒋军十七个旅”的口号又轰动起来。最后，滕副司令员号召大家向朱总司令学习，正规军要更多的打胜仗，消灭敌人，广泛开展敌后游击战争，配合主力军队作战。后方要进行大练兵，彻底贯彻土地改革，全力支援前线，在今年新年的时候，我们再消灭蒋军三四个旅，来迎接一九四七年”。（全场鼓掌欢呼）
