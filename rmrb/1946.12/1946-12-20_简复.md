　　Brief Reply
　　Question: We are preparing to adapt "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" into a play for performance, but we have a few questions and would like your guidance: (1) Is Sanbian a region or a village? In which direction is it from Yan'an? How far away is it? (2) Since Wang Gui joined the guerrillas, why didn't Li Xiangxiang prepare for war and relocate? (3) What happened to Li Derui? In the play, we plan to have Second Master Cui shoot him in the back. Is that appropriate? (4) Li Xiangxiang's father died, why isn't she at all sad? (5) What does "tie up an old man to watch the melon" mean? What is the ending for Second Master Cui?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Democratic Theater, Bi Fu

　　Answer: It's very gratifying that you're preparing to perform "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang." We wish you a successful performance! Please let us know how the performance goes. The answers to your questions are as follows:
　　(1) Sanbian is the collective name for the three counties of Dingbian, Anbian, and Jingbian, and is now an administrative division on the border of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, abbreviated as Sanbian. It is about three or four hundred li northwest of Yan'an. (2) At that time, the Shaanxi-North Shaanxi Red Army mainly engaged in guerrilla warfare, unlike today when there are vast liberated areas. Therefore, although Wang Gui joined the guerrillas, Li Xiangxiang had to stay in the village. This is the most important thing to pay attention to when writing the script! (3) According to the original poem, Li Derui was sent out by Second Master Cui to be killed. But Li Xiangxiang probably didn't know about this, so that also answers the fourth question. It's okay to have Second Master Cui shoot Li Derui in the back in the play. (5) "Tying up an old man to watch the melon" is a method of tying someone up, which means tying the head in the crotch. Second Master Cui will undoubtedly be executed after being tied up, but you can consider whether to have a "summary execution on the spot" on stage!

　　Thank you for sending us the sheet music for "Shuntian You." As far as we know, this score has been revised after research by the Yan'an Lu Xun Academy of Arts, and the "bian gong hao" (changing work is good) is based on this score. The one we published last time, however, was recorded based on the singing of someone who had been to northern Shaanxi. So there are some discrepancies in the rhythm. Fortunately, the singing of folk songs is relatively free, and as long as you grasp the emotion, slight changes in the rhythm are not a problem.

　　Before this, we also received two sheet music pieces from Comrade Shi Yan of the Pioneer Theater. Because the melodies are largely similar, there is no need to publish them again. We would like to express our thanks here as well.

　　Question: In the full text of "Comrade Lu Dingyi's Speech" published in your newspaper on October 14th, it said that our regular army and local corps totaled 3.5 million, but the Xinhua Daily said it was 1.5 million. Which one is correct? (Yin Ruxiu asks)

　　Answer: The latter is correct.

　　简复
    问：我们准备把“王贵与李香香”编成剧本上演，但有几个疑问请来信指示：（一）三边是地区还是村子？在延安那个方向？有多远？（二）王贵既然参加了游击队，李香香为什么不备战转移？（三）李德瑞下落如何？在剧本上，我们打算叫崔二爷打了他的黑枪，合适吗？（四）李香香的父亲死了，为什么她毫不悲哀？（五）“捆一个老头来看瓜”是什么意思？崔二爷结局怎样？
                                            民主剧团璧夫问
    答：你们准备上演“王贵与李香香”，这是很可喜的，祝你们演出成功！并请把出演的效果告诉我们。所提的疑问答复如下：
    （一）三边即定边、安边、靖边三个县的合称，现为陕甘宁边的行政分区，简称三边。在延安的西北约三四百里。（二）当时陕北红军进行的主要是游击战，不像今天有广大的解放区，所以王贵虽然参加了游击队，而李香香还只好蹬在村里，这一点编剧时最要注意！（三）李德瑞据原诗是被崔二爷派出去害死了。但这种情形李香香恐怕不知道，所以也就连带解答了第四个疑问。剧中让崔二爷打了李德瑞的黑枪，是可以的。（五）老头看瓜是一种捆人的方法，就是把头捆在裤当里。崔二爷捆起来以后处死是无疑的，但在舞台上是不是要来一个“当场枪毙”，你们自己去考虑吧！
    谢谢你们给我们寄来“顺天游”的歌谱。据我们所知道，这个谱是经过延安鲁艺学院研究以后修改过的，“变工好”就是用的这个谱子。而上次我们发表的，却是根据一位到过陕北者的口唱记下来的。所以拍节上有些出入。好在民歌的唱法比较自由，只要把握住感情，节拍略有变更也不要紧。
    在这以前，我们还收到先锋剧团石岩同志寄来的两份曲谱，因为旋律大体类同，没有再登一次的必要，在此一并致谢。
    问：十月十四号贵报所载“陆定一同志在延讲话全文”中，说我们的正规军与地方兵团共三百五十万，但新华日报上却是一百五十万，那一个正确？（尹如修问）
    答：后者正确。
                                                      ——编者
