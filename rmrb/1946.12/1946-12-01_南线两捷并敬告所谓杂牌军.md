Two Victories on the Southern Front and a Warning to the So-Called "Miscellaneous Troops"
    *Liberation Daily*

    While issuing a hypocritical "cease-fire order," Chiang Kai-shek simultaneously ordered his troops to intensify their attacks on the liberated areas. His deceptive tricks have been seen through by the Chinese people, and his invading forces have been either thoroughly annihilated or resolutely repelled by the People's Liberation Army. The large-scale annihilation battle near Hua County in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region and the strong self-defense in the northwest of Huaiyin are powerful responses from the Chinese people to Chiang Kai-shek's vicious conspiracy.

    In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, after issuing the "cease-fire order," Chiang Kai-shek immediately ordered the occupation of Puyang to open up the Pinghan Railway. Upon receiving the order, Sun Zhen actively advanced with the remnants of his 41st and 47th Divisions. On the 19th, our troops under Liu Bocheng engaged them in the Hua County area, and by the 24th, delivered a crushing blow. On our army’s left flank, the entire 12th Security Brigade of Hebei, reorganized from puppet troops, was annihilated, and its commander, He Guan’san, was captured alive. On our army’s right flank, the 104th Brigade was annihilated, and its commander, Yang Xianming, and deputy commander, Li Keyuan, were captured. In the center, our army annihilated the headquarters and two regiments of the 125th Brigade, capturing its commander, Chen Xiaowen, and killing, wounding, and capturing 11,800 Chiang troops, achieving a tremendous victory in self-defense. This victory will impact the overall situation in the country.

    In the Northern Jiangsu region, two brigades of Chiang's troops advanced, with two regiments of the 7th Army as the main attacking force, and part of the 74th Division feigning movement to coordinate with the invasion of the Lian-Shu area. Our troops under General Su Yu engaged them in the northwest of Huaiyin. From the fierce fighting that began on the 17th and lasted until the 22nd, Chiang's troops suffered thousands of casualties, and two battalions of the 7th Army were completely wiped out, with their battalion commander captured. In addition, two American-made Chiang planes were shot down, and Chiang's offensive was repelled.

    Chiang's offensive completely exposes Chiang Kai-shek's shameless deception, truly showing his "cruel conspiracy." The Chinese people remember that Chiang Kai-shek even issued secret orders in addition to the public orders during the cease-fire order in January of this year. The public order limited the cease-fire to the 13th, while the secret order was to continue fighting until the 16th, and to occupy strategic locations in the liberated areas as much as possible within this period. As for the Northeast cease-fire agreement of March 25th, Chiang Kai-shek sent representatives to sign it, but it became Chiang Kai-shek's operational order for a large-scale offensive in the Northeast. The so-called temporary cease-fire that began on June 7th was actually Chiang Kai-shek's operational order for a large-scale offensive within the country. The Chinese people see these facts very clearly. This time, Chiang Kai-shek issues another "cease-fire order," followed by a major offensive, truly showing that he has no credibility and no sense of shame, which is the fundamental reason for his defeats.

    The Sun Zhen troops of the Sichuan Army, who attacked Puyang this time, and the 7th Army of the Guangxi Army, which formed the main force attacking Lian-Shu, while Chiang Kai-shek's own direct line troops remained inactive, watching without offering help, at most only playing supporting roles, in order to avoid sacrifices.

    The fate of the Sichuan Army is very miserable. During the War of Resistance against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek transferred a total of six army groups, more than eleven armies (according to 1940 statistics) out of Sichuan. Li Jiaoyu of the 36th Army Group died in battle during the War of Resistance, and the 47th Army under his command suffered heavy casualties. Not only was it not replenished, but its designation was cancelled. Tang Shizun of the 23rd Army Group originally commanded three armies: the 50th, 21st, and 88th Armies. Due to casualties and lack of replenishment, it was eventually merged into the 21st and 88th Armies. Fan Shaozeng, commander of the 88th Army, was nominally promoted but actually demoted by Chiang Kai-shek, who handed the army over to Fang Xianjue, a pro-Chiang surrendered-Japanese general, to command, thus usurping the army. Wang Zuanxu of the 29th Army Group originally commanded two armies: the 44th and 67th Armies, which were eventually merged into a single 44th Army. Wang Lingji of the 30th Army Group originally commanded two armies: the 72nd and 78th Armies, which were merged into a single 72nd Army, and its commander was dismissed by Chiang. Only the 22nd Army Group under Sun Zhen, which originally had two armies, the 41st and 45th Armies (now the 47th Division), and the 27th Army Group under Yang Sen, which commanded the 20th Army, remained unchanged. Therefore, although the Sichuan Army contributed more to the War of Resistance than Chiang's direct line, the result of the war was that five armies were cancelled or usurped, almost half of them gone. In addition, in the Sichuan rear, after Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Chongqing, he actively divided eastern and western Sichuan. Pan Wenhua's 56th Army was transferred to Qianjiang, and the New 25th Division was downgraded to a police column. The strength of the Sichuan Army was weakened both at the front and in the rear.

    After the War of Resistance, Chiang Kai-shek launched a civil war. Two of the three brigades of the 21st Division of the Sichuan Army were annihilated in Nantong, and two of the three brigades of the 41st Division were annihilated. All two brigades of the 47th Division have been annihilated. These three divisions of the Sichuan Army, which Chiang Kai-shek placed on the front line, originally had eight brigades, leaving only two brigades, which is only one-quarter.

    The situation of the Guangxi Army is similar. During the War of Resistance against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek transferred two army groups, five armies, and fourteen divisions out of Guangxi (according to statistics from 1940). Xia Wei of the 16th Army Group originally commanded the 31st and 46th Armies. The 31st Army suffered heavy casualties in the Xiang-Gui Campaign and was not replenished, its designation cancelled (now this designation has become Chiang Kai-shek's "Youth Army"), and merged into the 46th Army. Li Pinxian of the 21st Army Group originally commanded three armies: the 7th, 48th, and 84th Armies. As a result, the 84th Army was cancelled and merged into the 48th Army. Therefore, the Guangxi Army suffered heavy casualties in the War of Resistance because it did not learn from many Chiang's troops to flee at the first sign of trouble or "save the nation through a circuitous route." It fought even more valiantly in the Shanghai-Nanjing area, and its war achievements were much greater than those of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the number of troops was only three armies and eight divisions, meaning that almost half were lost.

    In this civil war, Chiang Kai-shek again put two armies, two-thirds, of the Guangxi Army on the front line. The 7th Army has lost more than 5,000 men, or one-quarter.

    The officers and soldiers of the Sichuan and Guangxi Armies should think about it. You all made contributions during the War of Resistance, but is the reward you are getting supposed to be the same fate as the Northeast Army? You are fighting a civil war for Chiang Kai-shek. Besides the tragic future like the Northeast Army, what other future will you have? Why don't you think about the Chinese nation, why don't you think about yourselves?

    Not only that, Chiang Kai-shek is using all his savings from the past three or four years, plus the massive help from American imperialism and a large amount of Japanese military supplies, betting everything in an attempt to make a name for himself before the so-called "National Assembly." Now he is losing battles everywhere, and forty brigades have been annihilated, which means that one-fifth of the troops that Chiang Kai-shek is using to attack the liberated areas have been annihilated. Isn't Chiang Kai-shek's military decline obvious? Chiang Kai-shek's "National Assembly" is being denounced by everyone with insight at home and abroad, and Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous crimes are hated by the people across the country. Isn't his political failure obvious? The "miscellaneous troops" who are being annexed, usurped, weakened, and sacrificed by Chiang Kai-shek, shouldn't those with a sense of the times think about how to handle themselves?

    We sincerely warn all the so-called "miscellaneous troops," including the Northwest Army, the Northeast Army, the Sichuan Army, the Yunnan Army, the Guangxi Army, the Guangdong Army, the Shaanxi Army, the Hunan Army, the Zhili-Shanxi Army, the Shanxi-Suiyuan Army, the Ningxia Army, the Qinghai Army, and the Zhen Song Army. The enemies of the military and civilians in the liberated areas are only the American imperialists and their lackey Chiang Kai-shek. Because the American imperialists, like the Japanese imperialists, want to destroy China, and Chiang Kai-shek, like Wang Jingwei, is acting as a traitor for the American imperialists, betraying the Chinese nation. We have no irreconcilable hatred with you. On the contrary, we sympathize with all those who made contributions in the War of Resistance but are being discriminated against by Chiang Kai-shek. The Chinese nation is facing a new national crisis. National salvation is the responsibility of every citizen. We sincerely hope that you will maintain the glorious title of national heroes from the War of Resistance and not fight for the American imperialists and traitor Chiang Kai-shek against the Chinese people. Before you, there is a glorious path of national heroes, and a path of becoming pitiful sacrifices and running dogs of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, leaving a bad name for ten thousand years. We hope that you will wake up and make a decisive decision to stand on the new front for the struggle for national liberation, like Generals Gao Shuxun, Cao Yousan, Hao Pengju, Kong Congzhou, Pan Shuoduan, and Hu Jingduo have done.

　　南线两捷并敬告所谓杂牌军
    解放日报
    蒋介石一面发出虚伪透顶的“停战令”，另一方面令其军队加紧进攻解放区，他的骗人的把戏被中国人民识破，他的进犯军也被人民解放军痛快消灭，或者坚决打退了。冀鲁豫地区滑县附近的大歼灭战和淮阴西北的坚强自卫，就是中国人民给蒋介石恶毒阴谋的有力答复。
    冀鲁豫地区，蒋介石于发出“停战令”后，立即下令进占濮阳，以便打通平汉路。孙震奉令后，即以其四十一师、四十七师残部积极推进。十九日，我刘伯承蒋军所部迎击之于滑县地区，至二十四日止，给以粉碎的打击。计我军左翼歼灭由伪军所改编之河北保安第十二总队全部，生擒其总队长何冠三；我军右翼歼其一零四旅，擒该旅旅长杨显明及副旅长李克源；我军中路歼其一二五旅旅部及两个团，生擒其团长陈晓文，毙伤俘蒋军一万一千八百人，获得巨大的自卫战果。这一胜利将要影响全国的战局。
    苏北地区，蒋军两旅进犯，在第七军两个团为主攻，其七十四师一部佯动，配合淮犯涟沭地区。我粟裕将军所部迎击之于淮阴西北。自十七日激战至二十二日，蒋军伤亡千数百人，第七军之两个营被我全部消灭，并俘其营长，此外并击落美造蒋机两架，蒋军攻势被我打退。
    蒋军的进攻，完全揭穿了蒋介石的无耻欺骗，真正是“阴谋残忍”。中国人民记得，蒋介石甚至在今年一月停战令时公开的命令之外，还发了秘密的命令，公开的命令限十三日停战，秘密的命令是继续打到十六日，而且在此期限内尽量进占解放区战略要地。至于三月二十五日的东北停战协定，蒋介石派代表签了字，但成了蒋介石东北大打的作战令。六月七日起的所谓暂时停战，实际上是蒋介石关内大打的作战令。这些事实，中国人民看的清清楚楚。这一次蒋介石又来一个“停战令”，接着又来一个大进攻，真正是毫无信义不知廉耻，这是他打败仗的根本原因。
    蒋介石此次进攻濮阳的孙震部是川军，进攻涟沭的主力第七军是桂军，蒋介石自己的嫡系则按兵不动，坐视不救，至多也只当当配角，以避免牺牲。
    川军的命运是很惨的，在抗战期间被蒋介石调出四川来的共计六个集团军，十一个军之多（民国二十九年统计），三十六集团军李家钰抗战阵亡，该集团军所辖一个军即四十七军作战牺牲重大，不但毫无补充，且被取消番号。二十三集团军唐式遵，原辖五十军、二十一军、八十八军第三个军，作战伤亡毫无补充，结果并为二十一军与八十八军两个军，八十八军军长范绍曾被蒋介石明升暗降，将该军交给蒋的亲信降日将军方先觉指挥，这样该军被蒋篡夺。二十九集团军王缵绪，原辖四十四军、六十七军两个军，结果合并为四十四军一个军。三十集团军王陵基，原辖七十二军、七十八军两个军，合并为七十二军一个军，其军长又被蒋撤职。只有二十二集团军孙震原辖两个军，即四十一军四十五军（即现在的四十七师）与二十七集团军杨森所辖的二十军没有变动。所以川军虽然对抗战贡献超过蒋的嫡系，抗战的结果，却是五个军被取消或被篡夺，几乎去掉一半。此外在四川后方，蒋介石到重庆之后，川东川西积极分化，潘文华的五十六军被调到黔江，新二十五师降为警察纵队。川军力量不论在前方后方都遭削弱。
    抗战以后，蒋介石发动内战，川军二十一师三个旅在南通被歼两个旅，四十一师三个旅被歼两个旅，四十七师两个旅已全部被歼，这被蒋介石放到前线上的川军三个师，原有八个旅，只剩了两个旅，即四分之一了。
    桂军的情形也相差不多，抗战期间被蒋介石调出广西的，据民国二十九年的统计，有两个集团军，五个军，十四个师。十六集团军夏威原辖三十一军与四十六军，三十一军在湘桂战争中牺牲重大，不予补充，取消番号（现在这个番号成了蒋介石的“青年军”），并人四十六军。二十一集团军李品仙原辖七军、四十八军、八十四军，共三个军，结果八十四军被取消，并入四十八军。所以桂军在抗战中因为没有学许多蒋军那样望风而逃或“曲线救国”以致牺牲重大。沪宁一带的战争中更为壮烈，其战功比之蒋介石嫡系大得多。然而抗战胜利后，数量只剩下三个军，八个师，即是丧掉了几乎一半。
    此次内战中，蒋介石又把桂军两个军即三分之二放到前线上，其第七军前后已损失五千人以上，即四分之一。
    川军和桂军的将士们应当想想，你们在抗战中都是有功的，但是你们所得的酬报，难道应该是东北军第二的下场么？你们替蒋介石打内战，你们除了东北军那样的悲惨前途之外，还会有什么别的前途？你们为什么不为中华民族着想，为什么不为自己着想？
    不但如此，蒋介石用尽其三四年来的一切积蓄，加上美国帝国主义的大量帮助和日本的大量军用物资，孤注一掷，想在所谓“国大”以前打出一个名堂，现在到处打的是败仗，四十个旅已被歼灭，这就是说蒋介石进攻解放区的军队五分之一已被歼灭了。蒋介石军事上的颓势难道还不明显么？蒋介石的“国大”被国内国外一切有眼光的人所痛骂，蒋介石的卖国罪行已被全国人民所痛恨，政治上的失败难道还不明白么？在蒋介石并吞篡夺削弱牺牲之下的杂牌军，如果有识时务的俊杰，难道不该想想何以自处了么？
    我们诚恳的敬告一切所谓杂牌军，敬告西北军、东北军、川军、滇军、桂军、粤军、陕军、湘军、直晋军、晋绥军、宁夏军、青海军、镇嵩军，解放区军民的敌人，只有美国的帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石。因为美国的帝国主义者像日本帝国主义一样要灭亡中国，蒋介石像汪精卫一样，当美国帝国主义的汉奸，出卖中华民族，我们同你们并无不可解的仇恨，恰恰相反，凡是抗战有功而被蒋介石岐视的，我们都抱同情。中华民族面临着新的民族危机，国家兴亡，匹夫有责，我们十分希望你们保持抗战中民族英雄的光荣称号，不要去替美国的帝国主义者及汉奸蒋介石打中国人民。摆在你们面前的，一条是民族英雄的光荣道路，一条是当卖国贼蒋介石的可怜的牺牲品和走狗、遗臭万年的道路。我们希望你们翻然猛省当机立断，站到新的为民族解放而斗争的阵营中来，像高树勋、曹又参、郝鹏举、孔从周、潘朔端、胡景铎将军等所做的一样。
