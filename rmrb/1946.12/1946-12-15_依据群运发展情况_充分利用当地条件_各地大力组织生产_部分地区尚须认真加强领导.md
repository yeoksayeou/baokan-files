[This newspaper's composite report] Various regions in the Border Area are vigorously launching winter production campaigns on a large scale, in various forms combined with the self-defense war. The main contents of these campaigns in places like Licheng, Wuxiang, Yushe, Pingshun, Heshun, and Shexian in Taihang are developing textiles, transportation, and various workshops. Drawing on last winter's experiences, and based on the principles of "relying on the mountains for what the mountains offer, and relying on the water for what the water offers" and "doing whatever one can do," a large number of small cooperatives have been developed.

In old liberated areas, such as Heshun, the tendency of "emphasizing land redistribution over production" has been overcome. Based on the county's coal production, four transportation lines have been opened, and 3,902 full laborers and 2,344 half laborers have been organized to engage in transportation. The county government is planning to set up coal stations and increase the number of inns to facilitate export organization. At the same time, efforts are being made to organize return trips in conjunction with grain transportation. The county's joint cooperative and stores are using 4 million yuan of capital to purchase return goods, striving to avoid empty return trips during grain transportation.

In addition to stepping up the boiling of saltpeter, Licheng is also paying attention to breaking through the masses' complacency and "winter idleness" mentality, strengthening leadership, and overcoming purely profit-driven behavior and blindness in production. The Gonghe Township in Shexian and the Matian Town in Zuoquan are even organizing credit cooperatives to absorb idle capital and invest it in production. In Yushe, each of the 24 joint defense units is buying a hand-operated shuttle loom to promote textile technology.

In terms of textiles, Xingtai aims to achieve self-sufficiency in planting, spinning, weaving, and wearing. It also put forward the slogan "Good cadres should go to cooperatives" to improve cooperatives. Wangjinzhuang in Shexian is paying attention to agricultural activities such as preparing fuel, accumulating fertilizer, and repairing land in preparation for next year's large-scale production, setting a good example of taking into account both agriculture and sideline production. Pingshun has decided to launch a winter production campaign surpassing any previous year in conjunction with rent reduction and anti-usury. It is paying attention to grasping family education during rent reduction and anti-usury, breaking the mindset of "waiting for subsidies" or complacency after gaining land, and organizing the fruits of labor into production in a timely manner.

In border areas constantly threatened by war, such as Xiyang, it has been decided to vigorously develop textiles and transportation around the self-defense war. It is also proposed that each person should store two jin of sea salt, and each spinning woman should store two jin of cotton, in preparation for wartime needs. Cooperatives should grasp the items needed by the masses during the war and be prepared to supply the masses at any time. Mobilize the masses to transport coal to avoid a shortage of coal during the war. During grain transportation, more attention should be paid to finding ways to solve the difficulties of the masses in voluntary transportation, and finding relationships to transport coal in exchange for public grain.

In addition, in order to ensure the completion of war support tasks without hindering the completion of production plans, many regions are unifying the use of labor and reasonably solving the production difficulties of participating militias, self-defense teams, and military families. Shexian has organized a "War Participation Production Labor Adjustment Committee." Wangjinzhuang in the county has also established a labor cooperative to implement a unified method of calculating and converting work points. Dagang Village has elected captains and vice-captains to be responsible for labor allocation, errands, transportation, and production. Zhengshi Village in Licheng has implemented a method of having one team engaged in transportation and another team pushing millstones while waiting for errands.

Zhang Chunzhi, a model family member of a revolutionary soldier in Dongbei Village, Licheng, has organized the production of women from military families. Wang Dazhuang, a special-class labor hero in Hulei Mountain, Wu'an, has organized the production of disabled people. Anyang, Tangyin, and Bo'ai have organized refugees to engage in production. Refugees in the first, fourth, and fifth districts of Bo'ai have solved the problem of cotton clothing, and in addition to consumption, have earned a dividend of more than 139,000 yuan in each district.

Jinan, such as Jize, Yuanchao, Weixian, Yongzhi, and Guangzong counties, has completed land reform, and each village is starting to shift to winter production in the spirit of "striking while the iron is hot." Many villages in Jize are rectifying organizations while actively preparing for winter production. Each village in Gaotang, after the end of the struggle, immediately began to set up cooperatives. The towel industry in Xujiazhuang, Shaogu, and other villages in Weixian is developing rapidly due to the peasants' acquisition of land and capital. Xujiazhuang has achieved "weaving one and having one left over," exceeding agricultural income by six times.

Although Taiyue and Jiluyu are in a very tense war environment, they are still seizing the gaps in the war to carry out production. The Taiyue Xinhua Daily published an editorial last month calling on the entire region to "seize the gaps in the war to launch a winter textile campaign." The Taiyue Administrative Office has provided 10 million yuan in loans to support the development of this campaign. The Fifth District of Shimin has achieved self-sufficiency in planting, spinning, weaving, and wearing. Wacao Village in Gaoping has achieved household textile production. The Beiliu Village Textile School in Yangcheng, with the help of the masses to solve the difficulties of tools, has become a good way to promote the textile movement in the new district. In addition to developing textiles from points to areas, Jincheng is also combining it with transportation. Five administrative villages such as Tuling in Fushan have formed a textile team of more than 400 women, determined to make up for this autumn's poor harvest with spindles and shuttles.

Yangguai Village in Qingfeng, Jiluyu, has organized four mutual aid teams to boil salt, push flowers, and do carpentry. They do whatever they can, often working from the fifth watch (3-5 am), completing war support tasks and still earning money through production. The teams also hold a meeting every ten days to check on each other's diligence and laziness. Qinmiao in Nanfeng has also organized many mutual aid teams to go on errands and do business, uniformly allocate labor, and share profits from business. As a result, they can go on errands and do business without delaying business.
