According to the Ta Kung Pao, since the opening of the "National Assembly," the Shanghai financial market has been uneasy. Stock prices have plummeted, while the U.S. dollar has soared.

From the opening day of the "National Assembly," the police in Nanjing were dispatched to stop residents in the vicinity from cooking, saying they were afraid of causing a fire that would disturb the Assembly. Residents angrily said, "We'd rather not have any constitution; eating is more important."

According to Zhang Li-sheng's estimate, the cost of this conference will be at least two million yuan or more.

According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on November 28th: Recently, the price of gold in major cities is highest in Nanjing. The market price the day before yesterday was 294,000, which is 25,000 higher than Shanghai. It is said that the "National Assembly" representatives are buying gold in large quantities in Nanjing, so the capital's gold price has taken the lead and led the whole country.

According to the Nanjing Xinmin Daily News: Since the opening of the "National Assembly," the number of car accidents in Nanjing has increased significantly, almost every day. According to the Social Bureau, this is because the city has added more than 200 "representative" cars.

A "National Assembly" representative from Chongqing took an airplane, and when he was weighed at the airport, the representative seemed to think it was insulting to his status, so he ordered his servant to be weighed instead. He immediately had a dispute with the China National Aviation Corporation staff. The representative said, "National affairs are handled carelessly, so why be serious about such a small matter?"

On the 18th, the method of electing the "National Assembly" presidium was discussed for a whole day without any results. Most of the representatives had lost patience, and those who went on stage to express their opinions on the 19th were booed off.

During the chaotic speeches at the meeting on the 19th, the order of the meeting was extremely chaotic. A "representative" made the following brilliant statement: "If it's chaotic, it's chaotic. If it's not chaotic, it's not chaotic. Since it's already chaotic, let's all be chaotic. Why correct it when it's just starting to be chaotic?"

During the refreshment break on the 19th, there were not enough refreshments, and there was a scramble. Moreover, the refreshments were all made with lard, which made the Muslim representatives very dissatisfied.

At the meeting on the 25th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Kong Geng went on stage and said, "Today's chairman is the head of state, and we cannot let him work too hard." But the debate was still fierce at the meeting. Chiang asked everyone for their opinions on the rules of procedure, and some people shouted, "Vote!" The order of the meeting fell into chaos. Chiang slammed the table, and the noise and disorder increased greatly. Chiang Kai-shek then stood up and said, "Everyone should abide by the order and maintain the dignity of the representatives." All the representatives applauded.

On the 29th, the meeting continued until 12 o'clock, and the chairman announced an extension of five minutes. The representatives were going to eat, so they dispersed in a rush. On that day, a representative named Huang Shaomei went on stage to speak, instructing everyone to be humble, to consult, and not to boo. As soon as he said this, boos rose immediately. People shouted from the stage, "Who do you represent?" "Who are you teaching?" "Get down!" As a result, Huang had no choice but to roll off the stage.

During the meeting on the 4th, two female representatives were attentively counting banknotes one by one.

On the 4th, more than 500 "National Assembly" representatives elected a female reporter as the "flower of the National Assembly" reporters, and reporters from the venue rushed forward to inquire.

The third meeting was held on the 5th. Because the representatives were no longer interested in speaking, the vote to end the discussion passed, and the representatives applauded and cheered.

　　“国大”花絮
    据大公报消息：“国大”开幕后，沪金融市场人心忧戚不安，华股大跌，美钞则急升直涨。
    “国大”开幕那天起，京市警察出动制止附近居民炊事，说是怕引起火灾，惊了大会。居民愤恨的说：“我们宁可不要什么宪法，吃饭要紧”。
    据张厉生估计，此次大会经费至少在二百万万元以上。
    据天津大公报十一月二十八日载：近日各大都市之金价以南京为最高。前日市价二十九万四，较沪昂二万五。听说“国大”代表在京大买黄金，所以首都的金价竟一马当先，领导全国了。
    南京新民报息：“国大”开幕后，京市汽车伤人事件大增，几乎无日无之。据社会局解释，这是因为市上增加二百多辆“代表”汽车的原故。
    重庆某“国大”代表趁飞机时，机场过磅量体重，代表似乎以过磅有辱身份，乃命其听差代过，当即与中航公司人员发生争执，该代表称：“国家大事都马马虎虎，这点小事又何必认真？”
    十八日“国大”主席团选举办法讨论一天，毫无结果。多数代表已失去耐心，十九日登台陈述意见者多被嘘声赶下。
    十九日大会中在乱纷纷发言的情况下，会场秩序异常凌乱，一位“代表”先生发表如下之妙论：“要凌乱就凌乱，不凌乱就不凌乱，已经凌乱了，就大家凌乱，为什么要在刚刚凌乱时予以纠正？”
    十九日会中用点心时，点心少，发生抢风。且点心均为猪油所制，回教代表大为不满。
    二十五日大会中蒋介石主席，孔庚登台说：“今天的主席是国家元首，我们不能让他太劳苦了。”但会上还是争得厉害。蒋向大家征询议事规章案讨论办法，还有人吼叫：“表决子！”会场秩序陷于混乱，蒋拍起桌子，人声嘈嘈秩序大乱。蒋介石乃起立谓：“大家应遵守秩序，并维持代表尊严。”言毕各代表鼓掌。
    二十九日会中议事进至十二时，主席宣布延长五分钟，各代表要去吃饭了，便一哄而散。该日会中有代表名黄绍美者，登台讲话，嘱大家要虚心、要协商，不要嘘嘘，此言一出，嘘嘘之声顿时四起。台下大呼：“你代表谁？”“你教训谁？”“下去！”结果黄只好滚下台。
    四日开会时，有两女代表聚精会神的，一五一十数钞票。
    四日“国大”代表五百余人，选某女记者为“国大”记者之花，会场各记者群趋前询问。
    五日开第三次会，因各代表对发言已不感兴趣，结果表决停止讨论结束，代表们鼓掌欢呼。
