　　Visiting Brigade Commander Yang and Deputy Brigade Commander Li
　　Zhou Ziqin
　　On November 26th, this reporter interviewed Yang Xianming, brigade commander, and Li Keyuan, deputy brigade commander, of the Kuomintang army's 104th Brigade, who laid down their weapons in the recent Huaxian campaign, at a certain location on the front lines. Brigade Commander Yang is from Qionglai County, Sichuan Province, 52 years old, a graduate of the Army University and the Emei Military Training Corps. Deputy Brigade Commander Li is from Pujiang, Sichuan Province, and is the nephew of the late General Commander Li Jiayu of the 36th Group Army of the Sichuan Army. Both gentlemen spoke readily. When the reporter visited, Deputy Brigade Commander Li said, "Now, linking theory with practice has become like 'fish boiling in a pot!' Chiang Kai-shek wants to use the Sichuan Army to fight the civil war. Once their strength is exhausted, they will either be dismissed or forced into retirement. This is our future." Regarding being sent deep into the Liberated Areas under Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war policy, Brigade Commander Yang said, "The task given to us by our superiors was to occupy Shangguan and Liugu villages in Huaxian County, and then cooperate with the 124th Brigade in Daokou to directly attack Puyang. We adopted the 'holding points' tactic of steady and cautious advance, step by step. According to military requirements, 'holding points' must have strong forces and reserve firepower. We were not like the direct lineage 5th Army. We had neither enough heavy firepower such as large cannons, nor reserve forces, and our garrison locations were strictly limited by Gu Zhurong and Sun Zhen. Before the battle began, the 370th Regiment in Daokou was withdrawn to Huaxian County, and our troops in Liugu Village should have also been withdrawn to Shangguan Village to strengthen defense. However, our superiors did not allow it, resulting in dispersed forces and a weak rear. As soon as we made contact, the entire reconnaissance platoon was captured alive by the Eighth Route Army. Later, the Eighth Route Army was already close, but the sentries still thought 'the reconnaissance platoon is back.' By the time they realized it, it was already too late." At this point, Brigade Commander Yang and others laughed and said, "We really didn't expect the Eighth Route Army to have so many heavy weapons. From the beginning, the cannons were firing non-stop. A single building in front of us was hit by fifteen shells. The machine gun fire was particularly fierce, never letting up from beginning to end. And the Eighth Route Army soldiers' brave and tenacious attacking spirit was rarely seen in my more than twenty years of leading troops. They are truly China's first-class army! On the 19th, a gap was opened in the regimental fortress northeast of the village, and we couldn't plug it with two companies. On the 20th, there was a half-day of street fighting in Shangguan Village. The 124th Brigade in Daokou didn't come to reinforce us. Later, a plane came, but it strafed its own troops. Eighth Route Army soldiers had already climbed onto the roofs shouting for surrender. Seeing that there was no hope, we laid down our weapons." Deputy Brigade Commander Li Keyuan added, "The main reason for their failure this time was the loss of popular support. He said, "Our officers and soldiers who tried to break through were all captured by the common people, and none escaped. This time, laying down our weapons and leaving the civil war vortex to stand on the side of the people can be considered a great stroke of luck in misfortune."

　　访杨李正副旅长
    周子芹
    十一月二十六日，记者于前线某地访晤此次滑县战役放下武器之蒋军一○四旅旅长杨显明、副旅长李克源。杨旅长四川邛崃县人，五十二岁，陆军大学及峨嵋军训团毕业生。李副旅长四川蒲江人，系故川军三十六集团军李家钰总司令之亲侄。两氏谈锋甚健。记者往访时，李副旅长说：“现在联系实际已成‘釜底游魂！’蒋介石为了打内战还要利用川军，一旦力量消耗尽了，不是遣散，便是强令退役，这就是我们的前途。”谈及此次在蒋介石卖国内战政策下，孤军深入解放区时，杨旅长说：“上峰给我们的任务是占领滑县上官、留固等村后，配合道口一二四旅等直取濮阳。所采取的是稳扎稳打、步步为营的‘守点’战术。按军事要求来说，‘守点’必须有强大的兵力和后备火力，我们不像嫡系第五军那样，既无足够的大炮等重火器，又无后备兵力，而且驻地全是由雇祝同、孙震限定得死死的。这次战斗开始前道口的三七○团撤回滑县，我们在留固村的部队也应撤到上官村，加强守备，上峰却不准，致使兵力分散，后卫空虚，刚一接触，整个搜索排全被八路军活捉了。后来八路军已到跟前，步哨仍以为‘搜索排回来了’，待发觉时已经晚了。”谈至此，杨旅长等大笑不止说：“我们真没有想到八路军有这样多的重武器，一开始大炮就轰个不停，单我们前面的一座楼就中了十五发炮弹。机关枪的火力特别猛烈，从开始至结尾一直没松过劲。而八路军战士英勇顽强的攻击精神，是我带兵二十多年来所少见的，真是中国第一流的军队！十九号那天村东北团砦被打开一个缺口，我们用两个连都没有堵住。二十号在上官村巷战半天，道口的一二四旅，不来增援，后来来了一架飞机，却向自己部队扫射。八路军战士已爬上屋顶叫缴枪，我们看到已无希望，便放下了武器。”李克源副旅长紧接着说：这次他们失败的原因主要在于失民心，他说：“我们突围的官兵都被老百姓捉回来，一个也没有跑掉。这次放下武器离开内战漩涡站到人民方面来，可谓不幸中之大幸。”
