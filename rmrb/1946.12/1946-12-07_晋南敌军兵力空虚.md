Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Lüliang, 3rd: The Chiang-Yan forces in Southern Shanxi are weak and empty, and extremely panicked. According to a private letter seized by the Eighth Route Army from Yong Long, the Xiangling County person in charge for Yan's side, to his uncle on November 5th, "Hu Zongnan's troops have recently mostly moved to Shaanxi to attack Yan'an. Only one division is stationed in the Linfen area. Hongdong, Zhaocheng and other places are guarded by local armed forces, and fortifications are being built."

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 4th: The Eighth Route Army's mobile warfare has frightened Yan Xishan. In the secret publication "Instructions to the Iron Army Troops" seized from him, it stated: "The Eighth Route Army's mobile warfare is a strategic policy of growing stronger every day, advancing in big strides and retreating in big strides. We (Yan Xishan referring to himself) cannot hit him, so he (referring to the Eighth Route Army) suffers very few losses, and we leave gaps, which are resolved by him. This tactic of the Communist army makes us feel extremely difficult." The strong combat effectiveness of the Eighth Route Army has also shocked Yan Xishan. The instruction on September 27th pointed out that the Eighth Route Army's "first is that it becomes fiercer the more you attack, and second, there are many methods of attacking bunkers." Therefore, Yan Xishan has lost confidence in the "impregnable bunkers" he thought were in the past. "High bunkers are easily destroyed by enemy artillery (referring to the Eighth Route Army), and low bunkers cannot resist the enemy's wave-like charges."

　　晋南敌军兵力空虚
    【新华社吕梁前线三日电】晋南蒋阎军兵力空虚，异常恐慌。据八路军由大宁战斗中缴获之阎方襄陵县负责人永隆于上月五日给其叔父之私人信中称：“胡宗南部近日大部开赴陕西，进攻延安，临汾一带仅驻一个师，洪洞、赵城等地均由地方武装守备，现正加紧构筑碉堡。”
    【新华社晋绥四日电】我八路军的运动战已使阎锡山胆惊心寒。在其被我缴获之秘密刊物“铁军军队中指示称：“八路军运动战是天天壮大的战略方针，大踏步的前进和大踏步后退，我们（阎锡山自称）打他打不上，所以他（指八路军）很少损失，而我们漏下空子，被他解决。共产党军这一战法使我们极感困难。”八路军坚强战斗力亦震慑阎锡山，九月二十七日指示中指出：八路军“第一是愈扑愈猛，第二是攻碉方法很多。”因此使阎锡山对其过去认为“不可攻克的碉堡”亦失去信心，“高堡易被敌炮（指八路军）摧毁，低碉堡亦不能抵抗敌人的波浪冲锋”。
