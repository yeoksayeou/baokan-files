Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 29th—The "Anqing" unit of the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu is enthusiastically carrying out a campaign to establish combat heroes and merit. During a pursuit battle on the Su(qian)-Shu(yang) highway, Hua Guoyou's squad served as the vanguard. When they were 50 meters away from the fleeing Chiang troops, the platoon deputy shouted, "There's a machine gun ahead!" Hua Guoyou immediately lunged forward and seized the machine gun. Then, he led the entire squad straight ahead, frightening three Chiang soldiers into surrendering. When Deputy Squad Leader Wu Defu was wounded while seizing the machine gun, he immediately went to rescue him. Chiang's soldiers fired two shots at him, but both missed. Hua Guoyou bravely chased after them and grabbed two Chiang soldiers. In the ten-minute battle, Hua Guoyou's squad captured a total of 42 Chiang soldiers alive, killed 10, and seized 4 light and heavy machine guns and 21 rifles, creating a brilliant example of defeating the many with the few. Hero Squad Leader Hua Guoyou is a young model party member, not only brave and skilled in battle, but also honest and amiable. He always endures hardship first and never cares about personal gains or losses. He is deeply loved by all the soldiers in the squad, and therefore, was elected as the first combat hero by all the commanders and fighters of the "Truth" unit of the "Anqing" department, and became a role model for everyone in the "Anqing" department to learn from.
