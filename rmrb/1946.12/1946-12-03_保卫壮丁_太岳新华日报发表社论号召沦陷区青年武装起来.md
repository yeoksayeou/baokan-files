　　“Protect the Draftees”
　　Taiyue Xinhua Daily Publishes Editorial Calling on Youth in Occupied Areas to Arm Themselves
　　[Report from this newspaper in Taiyue, December 2nd] The Xinhua Daily here published an editorial entitled "Protect the Draftees," calling on the military and civilians of the entire region, especially the masses in the occupied areas, to rise up and launch a struggle against Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan to protect draftees. Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy is to overcome the contradiction of his insurmountable lack of troops, so he is learning from his Japanese father's method of "using war to support war," attempting to make the people in the occupied areas forever fall into the hell of deep water and scorching fire. The editorial also pointed out that the various methods used by Chiang's army along the Tongpu Railway to capture draftees are nothing more than forced conscription, encirclement and search, group arrest of draftees, roadside kidnapping of draftees, and deception and sale. Therefore, first: the young and middle-aged people in the temporarily occupied areas should be organized and armed to cooperate with guerrillas and militia to carry out guerrilla warfare to protect draftees. Second: If captured by the enemy, they should carry out disintegration work within the enemy, use every opportunity to organize battlefield uprisings, escape with weapons, and at the same time, seize the opportunity to expose Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy and methods to the deceived masses, and create various ways to protect draftees. Third: If people from the border areas flee to the Liberated Areas due to the oppression of the enemy, they should be verified and allowed to pass, and given comfort and resettlement. Finally, it calls on the military and civilians of the entire region to combine with the actual situation of the local enemy-us struggle, make arrangements quickly, and prevent and overcome the phenomenon of indifference and neglect.

　　“保卫壮丁”
  　太岳新华日报发表社论号召沦陷区青年武装起来
    【本报太岳二日电】此间新华日报以“保卫壮侗为题，发表社论，号召全区军民，特别是沦陷区的群众，起来与蒋阎展开保丁斗争。蒋介石这一阴谋是为了克服他不可克服的兵力不足的矛盾，所以学习他日本爸爸的“以战养战”的方法，企图使被占区的人民永远陷于水深火热的地狱中。该社论又指出蒋军在同蒲沿线采用的各种捕丁办法，不外强迫征兵，包围搜捕、编组抓丁、路上劫丁、欺骗贩卖。因此，第一：应把暂时沦陷区的青壮年组织起来，武装起来，配合游击队民兵，开展保丁斗争的游击战争。第二：万一被敌捕捉，应在敌顽内部进行瓦解工作，利用一切机会，组织战场起义，携械逃跑，同时利用时机，向被骗群众揭露蒋介石的这一阴谋与办法，创造各种办法保卫壮丁。第三：边沿区群众如有因敌顽压迫逃来解放区者，应验明放行，并给以安慰安家。最后号召全区军民结合当地敌我斗争的实情，速作布置，防止与克服漠视不管的现象。
