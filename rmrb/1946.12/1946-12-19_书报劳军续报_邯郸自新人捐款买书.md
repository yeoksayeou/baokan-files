　　Handan Newcomers Donate Money to Buy Books

　　[Our Newspaper] The book and newspaper donation campaign is continuing enthusiastically across various regions. From the 1st to the 9th of this month, within ten days, according to incomplete statistics from correspondents in Shahe, Handan, Chengci, Changzhi, and Licheng counties: there were 4,320 books, periodicals, and picture albums, 366,925 yuan in book donations, over 270 letters of sympathy, and countless other items such as soap, towels, shoes, and socks. Among them, the teachers and students of the elementary schools in the third and fourth districts of Shahe were most concerned about the frontline Eighth Route Army soldiers. They donated 200,000 yuan in book and newspaper funds and received over 70 letters of sympathy within a week. An eleven-year-old girl from Baicuo Elementary School also donated 50 yuan, which she earned from spinning during her spare time while studying. Wang Zhanji, a cook at the Second High School, insisted on donating his 200 yuan allowance to buy books and wrote a letter to the frontline Eighth Route Army, saying, "I have not forgotten you." The newcomers at the Handan City Detention Center also donated 1,300 yuan they earned from production, requesting that it be used to buy books and newspapers to send to the front. After donating books to support the army himself, Principal Jin of the Second Complete Primary School in Chengci also called on everyone to save one yuan or one tael of rice to buy books to support the army. After seeing Comrade Lu Zhimo's letter published in this newspaper, people from all walks of life in Changzhi voluntarily requested to donate books and funds. The Fourth Middle School in the city donated 6,000 yuan in silver dollars in one day to buy books and send them to the front. After donating book funds, teachers and students of the First High School in Licheng also organized four propaganda teams, beating gongs and drums, singing and dancing to solicit book funds in villages such as Xiaguihua and Tuling, raising 16 books and 21,000 yuan in book funds in three days.
