　　The Deeply Tragic Years of the People of Northeast China
    Drafts Everywhere Inside and Outside Changchun
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd] Special correspondent Liu Baiyu reports that he went deep into the Chiang-occupied area and witnessed the people enduring the tragic years of "Manchukuo." Drafts were being conducted everywhere inside and outside Changchun. All those aged eighteen to forty-five could not escape. According to a Jilin Provincial Government document recently captured by the Democratic Allied Army, "More than 2,000 young men were forcibly conscripted in Nong'an County alone." The document specifically pointed out that draftees must carry a five-household joint guarantee booklet and a household booklet. "The tragedy of farmers in Nong'an cutting off their fingers with kitchen knives to escape conscription has been discovered." The things that the common people in the Chiang-controlled areas hate the most are drafting, grain requisitioning, and the creation of bandits and looting. In the area north of Changtu, bandits were found to be grabbing pedestrians, training them for a month, and then incorporating them into the "Central Army." After the reporter entered this area, compatriots indignantly told him, "We have stood up, but the Chiang army wants to turn us back."

　　东北人民重度悲惨岁月
    长春内外处处抓丁
    【新华社东北二日电】本社特派记者刘白羽报导，他深入蒋占区，目睹人民正重度其“满洲国”悲惨的岁月，长春内外，处处抓丁，凡十八岁到四十五岁者，均无法幸免。据民主联军最近缴获之吉林省政府文件中称：农安一县，即强征壮丁二千余名，文件中特别指出，壮丁得携带五家联保手册及户闾手册。“农安已发现农民用菜刀砍断手指，以逃避抽丁的惨剧”。蒋管区老百姓最痛恨者一为抓丁，二为征粮，三为制造土匪抢劫。在昌图以北地区，发现土匪抢拉行人，训练一个月后，即编入“中央军”。记者进入这一地区后，同胞愤然告以“我们翻了身，蒋军竟要把我们翻回去”。
