　　Winter Schools Begin in Various Parts of Taihang
    Administrative Office Guidance Teams Go to the Countryside
    [Our newspaper’s Changzhi report] Winter schools in various parts of Taihang began one after another in mid-November. In order to exchange experiences in a timely manner and to promote the widespread and in-depth development of the winter school movement, the Education Department of the Administrative Office organized three guidance teams, which departed on December 11th to provide guidance in various regions. Before their departure, detailed discussions were held, mainly focusing on: This time, we must organize forces as much as possible to conduct a general inspection and individual guidance. During the inspection and guidance, we should commend models, gather experience, exchange information in a timely manner, and overcome the past bad tendencies of only paying attention to large villages, not paying attention to small mountain villages, only guiding the good, and not guiding the bad. Only through universal promotion can we achieve comprehensive results. Guiding the bad well can create more valuable experience, be more instructive, and enhance everyone's confidence and enthusiasm in striving for balanced development. It was particularly emphasized that in the guidance, we must humbly learn from the masses, discover problems, and voluntarily help solve practical problems according to the needs of the masses, so that winter schools truly become the locomotive of central work.

　　太行各地冬学开始
    行署辅导组下乡
    【本报长治讯】太行各地冬学已于十一月中旬先后开学。行署教育处为及时交流经验，并使冬学运动普遍深入的开展，特组织三个辅导组，于十二月十一日出发，分到各地进行辅导。临行前作了详细的讨论，主要是：这次下去要尽可能组织力量，进行普遍的检查，与个别的辅导。并在检查辅导中，表扬模范、汇集经验、及时交流、克服已往只注意大村、不注意小山庄、只辅导好的、不辅导坏的不良倾向。只有普遍的推动，才会有全面的收获。把坏的辅导好，才能创造更宝贵的经验，才更富于指导性，才能提高大家的信心和热情，来争取平衡发展。特别提出在辅导中要虚心向群众学习，发现问题，根据群众需要自愿，帮助解决实际问题，使冬学真正成为中心工作的火车头。（常江河）
