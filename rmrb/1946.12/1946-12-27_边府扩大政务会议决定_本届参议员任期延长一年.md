　　Border Region Government Expanded Government Affairs Meeting Decides:
    Term of Office for Current Senators Extended by One Year
    [This Newspaper's News] Border Region Correspondent Xiu Shan reports: The Border Region Government held an expanded government affairs meeting on the 20th. Border Region Government department heads, committee members remaining in the government, and bureau chiefs all participated. Mr. Lü Shouyuan, a senator residing at the Senate, attended as an observer. The meeting mainly discussed the issue of the term of office for Border Region senators. In view of the current situation in the Border Region, which is in the midst of an intense patriotic self-defense war, both the front and rear battle service work are very busy, the widespread rural emancipation movement is still awaiting full implementation, and preparations are being made for large-scale production next year, it is quite difficult to hold elections. According to Article 6 of the Border Region Senate Organization Regulations, under the above special circumstances, the term of office of the current senators may be extended by one year, and the election work for the second session of senators has been decided to be postponed until next year.

　　边府扩大政务会议决定
    本届参议员任期延长一年
    【本报消息】边府通讯员秀山报导：边区政府于二十日上午举行扩大政务会议，边府各厅长及留府各委员各局长等均参加，参议会驻会参议员吕守元先生列席。会议主要讨论边区参议员任期问题。鉴于目前边区处在紧张的爱国自卫战争中，前后方战斗勤务工作均甚繁忙，广大农村翻身运动，尚待全力贯彻，并准备明年大生产，办理选举，困难颇多。根据边区参议会组织条例第六条之规定，在上述特殊情况下，本届参议员之任期可延长一年，第二届参议员之选举工作决定推迟于明年举行。
