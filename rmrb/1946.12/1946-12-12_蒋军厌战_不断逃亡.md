    Chiang Troops War-Weary
    Constantly Deserting
    [This newspaper's front-line reporter team, 8th dispatch] Desertion incidents among Chiang's troops are increasing daily. Su Bin, deputy platoon leader of the 6th Company, 288th Regiment, 5th Army (an American-equipped Chiang unit), who laid down his arms in Puyang County, told reporters: Of the 140 men in the 6th Company, only a little over 40 remained after the battle of Xiliu Temple (west of Longguji) in September. After the Longguji battle, 110 men were replenished, two-thirds of whom were new recruits drawn from places like Anhui, and the other part were civilians seized along the way. Among our twelve men, one was from the Dingtao Liberated Area. Desertion is very serious; on average, three to five men run away from a company every day. The northern invading officers and soldiers are extremely afraid. The troops stop after marching only one or two li, and people are sent ahead to scout. They walk and stop, stop and walk. On the 2nd, they only marched six li in one night. They dare not march at night at all. Once, during a night march, a shot was heard in front, and everyone ran away. A platoon leader with a platoon has not returned to the team until now. When they arrive in a village, they lock up all the civilians together, fearing that the civilians are all militia. Therefore, even though we have American weapons, we cannot avoid becoming a transportation team for the Eighth Route Army. (Ding Man)

    蒋军厌战
    不断逃亡
    【本报前线记者团八日电】蒋军厌战逃亡事件日益增多。在濮县城放下武器之美械蒋军第五军二八八团六连副排长苏斌告记者说：六连有一百四十个人，九月西柳庙（龙ｇù＠①集西）一仗下来，只剩了四十多个。龙ｇù＠①集战斗后又补充到一百一十人，三分之二是安徽等地抽来的新兵，另一部分是随路抓的老百姓，我们十二个人中就有一个是定陶解放区的，逃亡现象非常严重，一个连平均每天要跑三个到五个。北犯官兵害怕的不得了，走一二里地队伍即停止，派人向前搜索，走走停停，停停走走，二号那天，一夜只走了六里地。晚上根本不敢行军，有一次晚上行军听得前面打了一枪，大家都跑乱了，一个排长带着一个排，到现在还没有归队。到村里就把所有的老百姓赶到一块关起来，怕老百姓都是民兵。所以我们虽有美国武器，也免不了给八路军当运输队。（丁曼）
