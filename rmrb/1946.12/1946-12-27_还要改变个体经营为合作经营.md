　　The current Shaogu towel industry still has the following problems: 1. Middle peasant and above households have misconceptions about mass movements, which affect production morale. 2. Specific organizational leadership is still very insufficient. To date, each household still operates individually. Every market day, each family goes to buy thread and sell towels, wasting a lot of manpower and time. If there are organizations such as cooperatives and mutual aid groups to collectively manage the purchase of thread and sale of towels, time and manpower will be saved, and quality will definitely be improved. 3. Leaders do not pay enough attention to the management, improvement, and enhancement of this mass operation. There are no rewards for inventors and labor heroes who are actively involved in promoting their labor enthusiasm and improving their creative spirit, in order to seek a wider range of development. 4. All production profits go to the family. The enthusiasm of some women or the passion for production improvement cannot be fully utilized. If there is an appropriate reward and family dividend system, labor efficiency and product quality will be improved. 5. If the government pays more attention to opening up towel sales channels, mass sideline production will be more widespread. These points are issues that leadership should urgently pay attention to and solve.

　　还要改变个体经营为合作经营
    目前邵固的毛巾业还存在以下的问题：一、中农以上户，对群运有错觉，影响生产情绪。二、具体的组织领导还十分不够，至今各户仍是个体经营，逢集各家都去买子卖毛巾，人力时间很多浪费。如有合作社、互助组等组织，代买线子卖毛巾集体经营，时间人力节省，质量定可提高。三、领导上对这种群众的经营，提高改进注意都不够，没有奖励创造发明者和劳动英雄积极分子，以发扬其劳动热忱，提高其改进创造精神，以求更广泛的开展。四、生产获利全归家庭，有些妇女积极性或生产改进热情就不能高度发挥，如有适当的奖励和家庭分红制度，劳动效率、产品质量，都会提高。五、政府对组织毛巾销路上，如再加以注意开辟，群众性的副业生产，将会得到更普遍的开展。这几点，是领导上亟应注意解决的问题。
