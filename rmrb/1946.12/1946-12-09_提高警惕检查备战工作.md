　　Heighten Vigilance and Inspect War Preparations

　　Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries have mobilized a large army, attempting a pincer movement from the north and south to converge on Handan and Xingtai. Our areas along the Pinghan Railway are once again under serious threat of attack by Chiang's troops.

　　To meet the new war situation and smash Chiang's offensive, we must urgently mobilize and thoroughly inspect our war preparations.

　　Chiang's troops' arrogant attempt to open up the Pinghan Line this time comes after he has begun to turn to the defensive in the overall national war situation, and after suffering two disastrous defeats in Juancheng and Hua County in our border region. Our army's continuous victories, the repeated annihilation of Chiang's troops, the emptiness of his reserves, the dispersion of his forces, and the extension of his lines of communication, all greatly encourage our confidence in victory, but these should not give rise to any ideas of underestimating the enemy or complacency. Although Chiang's troops have many difficulties, in local areas he is still capable of attacking us. Only by fighting a few more victories and annihilating more of his vital forces can we stop his offensive. We must heighten our vigilance and not be negligent in the slightest.

　　We must inspect the work of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, training the militia, and preparing to launch guerrilla warfare. We have a lot of experience in sparrow warfare, landmine warfare, sniper warfare, etc., and we can completely ensure that when Chiang's troops arrive, they will not get a single thing, not a grain of food, and will be restricted, depleted, and attacked everywhere. The key is to seriously prepare before Chiang's troops arrive. We should not only call for war preparations, but also earnestly inspect the effectiveness of war preparations. Those who have done well in war preparations must not be complacent and should do even better. Those who have not yet done well in war preparations must quickly catch up. All localities must improve war preparations through inspection.

　　We have the ability to eliminate the invading Chiang's troops, who are obviously in a desperate state of robbing Peter to pay Paul. General Liu Bocheng's victorious army is laying new traps for him. Strengthening war preparations in various places is to cooperate with the main force and create opportunities to annihilate the enemy. The better this coordination is, the better we can smash Chiang's offensive on the Pinghan Line and create conditions for further large-scale annihilation of Chiang's troops.

### 提高警惕检查备战工作

　　提高警惕检查备战工作
    蒋介石反动派调集大军，妄图南北合击，会师邯郸、邢台；我平汉沿线各地，又处在蒋军进攻的严重威胁之下了。
    为了迎接新的战争形势，粉碎蒋军的进攻，我们必须紧急动员，切实检查备战工作。
    蒋军这次打通平汉线的狂妄企图，是在全国战局中他已开始转入被动并在本边区鄄城和滑县两次惨败之后进行的。我军的不断胜利，蒋军的屡被歼灭，后备空虚，兵力分散，交通延长，这一切大大鼓舞了我们的胜利信心，但这些却不应使我们产生任何轻敌麻痹的思想。蒋军困难虽多，在局部地区他还是有能力向我进攻的。只有再打几个胜仗，再消灭他一些有生力量，才能停止他的进攻。我们必须提高警惕，不能有一点疏忽。
    必须检查坚壁清野，训练民兵，准备发动游击战争的工作。我们对于麻雀战，地雷战，冷枪战等等是很有经验的，完全可以做到让蒋军来到之后，得不到一点东西一颗粮食，到处遭受牵制、消耗和打击。关键就在于蒋军未来之前要认真进行准备。我们应当不仅进行备战的号召，而要切实检查备战工作的效果。凡备战工作做得较好的，切不能自满，应做的更好一些。备战工作还未做好的，要迅速努力赶上。一切地方都要在检查中把备战工作提高一步。
    挖肉补疮，窘态毕露的进犯蒋军，我们是有能力把他消灭的。刘伯承将军的常胜军，正在为他布置着新的陷阱。各地加强备战工作，就是要配合主力，创造歼敌的机会。这种配合做的愈好，就愈能粉碎蒋军对平汉线的进攻，并造成进一步大量歼灭蒋军的条件。
