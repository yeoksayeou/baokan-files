　　A Pilgrimage to Yan'an
    Lin Jian
    On November 19th, I made a pilgrimage to Yan'an. This city, representing the hopes of all the Chinese people, appears wholly unsubduable. Early in the morning, as the admirable buglers sounded the dawn, I began to cross the Yan River. In the square outside the South Gate, I saw groups of Self-Defense Forces, armed with rifles and red-tasseled spears, engaged in intense training. In 1935, it was these very masses who established a solid base here. Today, they have once again taken up arms, preparing to strike back against Chiang's invading troops. A merchant named Xu Xingzhai told me that he wanted to join the regular army, considering it a glorious page in his life to be able to defend his freedom and happiness with weapons.
    I proceeded down the street, flanked by rows of shops. Don't be fooled by the low houses; eight years ago, this was nothing but barren fields. Now, everything has been built up by the people's own hands. Among these shops, the two-story "Tongsheng Lou" stands out. Its owner, Wen Tongsheng, originally from Henan, came to Yan'an in 1933, and business was terrible. But after the establishment of the people's own government, business rapidly expanded. In the first half of this year alone, he has already made a profit of thirty to forty million. Because of this wealth, he says he will do his best to defend the border region. I passed through the old city, recalling how Chairman Mao led the Central Red Army to settle here in November 1936. The heroic figures in modern Chinese history, as described by American journalist Edgar Snow in "Red Star Over China," all gathered here. Now, ten years have passed. The Japanese used bombs to destroy the city's buildings, but they could not destroy the will of the people. Starting from this heroic city, they have developed to possess hundreds of people's cities and a population of 140 million people. I encountered a large group of children playing a game. They were digging earth to build fortifications and burying potato “landmines”. When I asked them if they were afraid of airplanes bombing them, one of the children said, "We have the Eighth Route Army here!"
    I visited many organizations and schools, where everyone is armed, waiting to strike back at the enemy. Take the art world, for example. The poet Ke Zhongping showed me his satchel. He took out a brush made of dragon's beard grass, ready to write poetry slogans on the walls and rocks of the battlefield mountains and fields at any time, serving the war effort. His beard is already gray, but his spirit is as vigorous as a young man's. In a cave dwelling in Lanjia坪, I saw Su Kaiguan, Director of the General Health Department of the Eighteenth Group Army. He told me many heroic combat rescue stories. In a recent self-defense battle, an Eighth Route Army soldier was wounded and fell under the enemy's machine-gun fire. A medic picked up a grenade, climbed the fire line, killed the Chiang army's machine gunner, and rescued the wounded soldier.
    I walked past the outskirts of the airport and visited Mr. Zhang Yongtai. He used to be a landlord, but now he works for a living himself. I asked him, "What will you do if Chiang Kai-shek attacks the border region?" He said, "What can I do? If he comes by road, I will hit him with a stone too. Although Chiang Kai-shek has airplanes and cannons, he will always have a place he can't hit. The people's power is greater than his." He has already delivered four dan of public grain to the government. From the lively and attractive eyes of his teenage granddaughter beside him, I saw the old man's love and hope. He said he hopes for victory, and he believes in victory. Standing on the earthen terrace in front of his cave door, we could see Zhang Yongtai's deciduous orchard. Next year, with the arrival of spring, we will still joyfully admire the green buds on these fruit trees.
    I walked back to my dormitory, and Yan'an was already in the night. This city, covered with cave dwellings all over the mountains, emits flickering lights from every cave dwelling, like countless stars guiding China forward in the dark night!

　　延安巡礼
    林间
    十一月十九日，我对延安作了一番巡礼。这代表着全中国人民希望的城市，一切都显得是不可被屈服的。早晨，当可敬的号兵们吹奏出黎明时，我开始越过延河前进，在南门外的广场上，我看到成群结队的自卫军背着步枪和红缨枪在紧张的操练。一九三五年就是这样一些群众在这儿建立了坚固的根据地，今天他们又重新拿起武器准备打击蒋军的进犯。一个商人徐兴斋告诉我说，他要参加正规军，他以能用武器保卫自己的自由幸福为他生命史上是光辉的一页。
    我在马路上前进，两侧是毗接着的商号，别瞧房屋低矮，八年前这儿还是一片荒芜的田野，现在一切都经过人们的两手建立起来了。在这些商号中，“铜生楼”的两层楼房耸立着，它的主人叫温铜生，他原是河南人，民国二十二年来到延安，生意很坏，但人民自己的政府建立后，营业就迅速发展起来，今年上半年他已盈利三四千万。为了这些财富，他说他要尽力来保卫边区。我穿过旧城，想起一九三六年十一月毛主席率领下的中央红军开始定居这里，美国名记者史诺在“西行漫记”中描写过的中国近代史上的英雄人物，都曾聚集这里。现在十年过去了，日本人用炸弹毁坏了这城市的建筑物，但不能毁灭人民的意志。以这个英雄城为起点，发展到拥有几百个人民城市和一万万四千万人民的局面。我遇到一大堆的孩子们在作游戏，他们用手挖土做工事，用山药蛋埋着地雷，当我问他们怕不怕飞机来轰炸时，一个小孩子说：“这里有八路军哩！”
    我参观了许多机关和学校，每个人都武装起来等待回击敌人。拿艺术界说吧，诗人柯仲平将他挂包拿给我看，他取出一支用龙须草扎成的笔刷，准备到战地山野的墙壁和岩石上随时写下诗标语，为战争服务。他的胡须已斑白了，但精神健旺有如青年人。蓝家坪的一孔窑洞里，我看见了十八集团军总卫生部部长苏开观，他告诉我许多英勇的战斗救护故事。在最近一次自卫战斗中，八路军一个战士负伤倒在敌人的机关枪火线下，卫生员就提了一颗手榴弹爬上火线，击毙蒋军的机枪射手后，把负伤的战士救回来。
    我走过飞机场的郊外，访问张永泰先生，他以前是位地主，现在自己劳动过日子，我问他“蒋介石打边区你怎么办”？他说：“怎样办，他从路上过来，我也要打他一石头；蒋介石虽有飞机大炮，但他总有个打不到处，百姓力量比他大”。现在他已经将四石公粮送到政府。我从他身旁十多岁的孙女儿的活泼诱人的眼睛里，看出这老年人的爱和希望，他说他希望胜利，他相信胜利。站在他的窑门前的土坪上，我们望得见张永泰的落叶的果树园，明年随着春的降临，我们仍会愉悦的欣赏着这些果树上的青绿的蓓蕾。
    我走回我的宿舍，延安已经是夜了。这遍山布满着窑洞的城市，从每一孔窑洞中都发射出闪烁的灯光，像无数的星星在黑暗的长夜中引导着中国前进！
