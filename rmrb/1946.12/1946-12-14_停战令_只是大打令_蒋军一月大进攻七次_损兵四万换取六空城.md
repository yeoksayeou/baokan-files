Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 12th: Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "Ceasefire Order," which took effect at noon on November 11th, is just as his simultaneously issued secret order stated: "It will not have any impact on our suppression plans in various areas." In total, from November 11th to December 10th, within a month, according to incomplete statistics, there were as many as seven large-scale offensives against the Liberated Areas. Namely: (1) On the morning of November 11th, Chiang's army's 26th Division, 59th Division, 77th Division, and other units in Southern Shandong, attached with dozens of armored vehicles and dozens of artillery pieces, under the cover of 24 American-made Chiang's aircraft, fiercely attacked the New Fourth Army positions north of Taierzhuang, south of Yixian, and on the Jinpu Railway branch line at Zhuluo, Quangou, etc. On the same afternoon, Chiang's army's 8th Army in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, in coordination with four American-made Chiang's aircraft and four American "gifted" warships, invaded Yexian City. (2) On November 11th, Chiang's army's 7th Division of the 3rd Army in Dingxian, joined forces with the Hebei Security Column to advance north along the Pinghan Railway towards Wangdu. The next day, Chiang's army's 94th Army and 53rd Army, totaling ten regiments from Laishui, fiercely attacked Yixian. (3) On November 11th, one regiment of Yan Xishan's Provisional 38th Division in Datong attacked Yungang in the northwest; on the same day, Yan Xishan's Engineering Regiment in Yangqu attacked Gujiao north of Jiaocheng. The next day, the 2nd Regiment of Yan Xishan's Provisional 38th Division, which had invaded Huairen, advanced south towards Daiyue. (4) Starting on November 17th, Chiang's army's 7th Army's 171st and 172nd Divisions and part of the 74th Division on the northern front of Jiangsu and Anhui, under the cover of four American-made Chiang's aircraft, launched an offensive from Lianghuai, attempting to capture Lianshui; starting on the 26th of the same month, Chiang's army's 25th Division, 65th Division, 67th Division, 83rd Division, and other units, totaling twelve regiments on the southern front of Jiangsu and Anhui, advanced north from Dongtai, Xinghua, and other places towards Yancheng. (5) Starting on November 19th, Chiang's army's 41st Division, 47th Division, and the 12th Column of the Hebei Security Column, etc., in Northern Henan, advanced northeast towards Puyang from Hua County and Changyuan; later, the 5th Army and the 32nd Division, 75th Division, 85th Division, etc., also invaded Puyang, Qingfeng, and Neihuang areas from Dongming and Anyang on the Pinghan Railway. Chiang's army's 3rd Army in Shijiazhuang and the ×× Regiment of the 53rd Division, newly transferred from the PingSui Railway, are also preparing to advance south, planning to join forces at Daming from both the north and south. (6) Starting on November 26th, Chiang's army's 38th Division and 50th Division of the New 1st Army, the 12th Division of the New 6th Army, the 21st Division of the 60th Army, and the 88th Division and 91st Division of the 71st Army, totaling six divisions in the Liaoning-Jilin area, launched a large-scale offensive north and northwest towards the Liaoji area from Huaide, Nongan, and other places in three routes. (7) On December 8th, Chiang's army's Hu Zongnan's troops, with five regiments, launched a large-scale offensive against the Guanzhong sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, invading more than 30 *li* into the Border Region, while last month on the 17th, Ma Hongkui's cavalry regiment on the western front had already invaded 30 *li* into the Border Region while advancing on the Sanbian area.

In the above offensives, Chiang's army has occupied six cities in the Liberated Areas, namely Yexian in Shandong (November 11th), Wangdu on the Pinghan Railway (5 pm, November 11th), Changkui in northern Liaoning (November 26th), Puyang in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area (November 30th), Qingfeng (December 7th), and Jiyuan in northern Henan (December 3rd), and had once occupied Huairen in northern Shanxi (November 12th) and Puyang County in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area (December 4th). As for small-scale offensives on various fronts, they are even more difficult to count. Facing Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous attacks, the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas rose up in self-defense with greater indignation, exchanging six empty cities for the annihilation of more than 40,000 of Chiang's army's living forces in one month. The civil war of the past month has shown that Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "Ceasefire Order" is just a combat order for him to fight freely, and at the same time proves that any of Chiang Kai-shek's thoroughly insidious trickery is worthless in the eyes of the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas.

    “停战令”只是大打令
    蒋军一月大进攻七次
    损兵四万换取六空城
    【新华社延安十二日电】蒋介石公布于十一月十一日正午时生效之所谓“停战令”，正如其同时颁发的密令中所称：“于我各区进剿计划，并不能发生任何影响”。总计自十一月十一日至十二月十日一个月内，据不完全统计，其对解放区较大规模之进攻，即有七次之多。即：（一）十一月十一日晨鲁南蒋军二十六师五十九师、七十七师等部，附装甲车数十辆，炮数十门，在美制蒋机二十四架掩护下，猛犯台儿庄以北、峄县以南、津浦支线之竹罗、圈沟等新四军阵地，同日下午胶济中段蒋军第八军在美制蒋机四架及美国“赠送”的军舰四艘配合下，侵入掖县城。（二）十一月十一日定县蒋军第三军第七师，纠合河北保安纵队沿平汉路北犯望都，次日涞水蒋军九十四军及五十三军共十个团猛犯易县。（三）十一月十一日大同阎军暂三十八师一团，向西北进攻云岗；同日阳曲阎军工兵团进攻交城北之古交，次日侵占怀仁之阎军暂三八师二团南犯岱岳。（四）十一月十七日开始苏皖北线蒋军第七军一七一及一七二两师及七十四师一部在美制蒋机四架掩护下，由两淮出犯，企图攻占涟水；同月廿六日开始，苏皖南线蒋军廿五师、六十五师、六十七师、八十三师等部共十二个团，由东台兴化等地北犯盐城。（五）十一月十九日起，豫北蒋军四十一师、四十七师、及河北保安十二纵队等部，分由滑县及长垣等地，向东北进攻濮阳；其后第五军及三十二师、七十五师、八十五师等部，亦由东明及平汉路之安阳等地窜犯濮阳、清丰与内黄地区。而石家庄蒋军第三军及新由平绥调至该地的五十三师××团亦正准备向南进犯，计划南北两路会师大名。（六）十一月二十六日开始辽（宁）吉（林）区蒋军新一军之卅八师五十师、新六军之十二师、六十军之二十一师、七十一军之八十八师、九十一师，共六个师由怀德农安等地分三路大举向北及西北进攻辽吉地区。（七）十二月八日，蒋军胡宗南部以五个团兵力向陕甘宁边区之关中分区大举进攻，侵入边区三十余华里，而上月十七日西线马鸿逵部骑兵团于进犯三边地区中已侵入边区三十华里。
    在上述各地进攻中，蒋军共侵占解放区城市六座，即山东之掖县（十一月十一日），平汉线上之望都（十一月十一日下午五时），辽北之长奎（十一月二十六日），冀鲁豫之濮阳（十一月三十日），清丰（十二月七日），及豫北之济源（十二月三日），并曾一度侵占晋北之怀仁（十一月十二日），及冀鲁豫之濮县（十二月四日）。至于各线小规模之进攻，更难于计数，面对蒋介石毫无信义的进攻，解放区军民以更大的义愤奋起自卫，在一个月内以六座空城换取蒋军四万余人有生力量的消灭。一月来的内战说明蒋介石的所谓“停战令”，只是他放手大打的作战令，同时又证明蒋介石任何阴谋透顶的耍花枪，在解放区军民眼里实在一文不值。
