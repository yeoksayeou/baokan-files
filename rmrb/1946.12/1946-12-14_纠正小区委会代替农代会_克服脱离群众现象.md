    【Report from this newspaper, Weixian, 11th】During the land reform in the Fourth District of Daming, it was discovered that the leadership did not have close enough contact with the masses, and the mobilization of the masses was not sufficient. The revolutionary sub-district committee replaced the Farmers' Representative Congress. Every village had cadres, and all work (reporting, deployment, summarizing) was carried out by the sub-district committee, forming a situation where cadres were stuck in the village, and the leadership was extremely busy. Cadres only approached a few activists and rarely approached the masses. The leadership of the activists was mostly from above them. During meetings, they first put forward their own opinions for the activists to discuss; or the activists would raise questions for discussion, and the cadres would speak last, which would then be taken as a resolution. This also led to the activists taking over everything. Everything was enforced without going through mass discussion, and the masses did not dare to express their opinions for fear of offending them. Once the cadres left the area, the work would collapse. The leadership, after examining the undemocratic work style mentioned above, emphasized the need to quickly establish a sub-district farmers' association preparatory committee, cultivate mass leaders, and ensure that the movement takes root. Based on the preparatory committee, the formal election of a sub-district farmers' representative congress should occur. Before the election of the sub-district farmers' representative congress, each village must universally elect a village farmers' representative congress. The masses must discuss it themselves, and the village cadres and activists must be taught to obey the opinions of the masses and establish a democratic work style.

    【Report from this newspaper, Weixian, 11th】At the beginning of the review of land reform in the First District of Wuxun, a conference of two hundred male and female activists from the entire district was convened. First, they reviewed the anti-traitor and liquidation movement of the past two months and unanimously believed that the shortcomings of the leadership in the past movement were still substitution and monopolization. In the early stage of the movement, they did not dare to let the masses handle things freely, and the work was fragmented, and a broad mass movement was not formed. In the final stage of the movement, although it appeared that they boldly let go, they still did not jump out of the circle of monopolization, but simply let go to the activists. During the movement, there was also the phenomenon of advanced villages taking over backward villages. The masses in backward villages were not mobilized, and it even created antagonism between the masses in different villages, giving saboteurs a lot of room to escape and hide. The conference finally resolved that everything should be boldly handed over to the masses to do themselves, and cadres and activists should only guide, inspect, and help the masses to advance the movement.

    纠正小区委会代替农代会
    克服脱离群众现象
    【本报威县十一日电】大名四区在查减中，发现由于领导与群众的联系不够密切，群众发动不够充分。该区翻身小区委员会代替了农民代表会，村村有干部，一切工作（汇报、布置、总结），均由小区委员会执行，形成干部死坐村，领导上非常繁忙，那村有事都得干部解决。干部只接近几个积极分子，很少接近群众。而对积极分子的领导，多是站在他们之上，开会时，先拿出自己的主张，让积极分子讨论；或由积极分子提出问题讨论，干部最后发言，即作为决议。因而也造成了积极分子包办，凡事不经过群众讨论，便强制执行，群众有意见不敢提，怕得罪了他们。一旦干部离开此地，工作就会垮台。领导上检查出以上不民主作风，强调提出要以小区为单位，迅速成立小区农会筹备会，培养群众领袖，使运动扎根，在筹备会基上正式选举小区农代会。小区农代会选举前，各村要普遍选举村农代会，必须由群众自己讨论，并教导村干积极分子，要服从群众意见，树立民主作风。
    【本报威县十一日电】武训一区在翻身大检查开始，召开全区二百男女积极分子大会。首先检讨了两个月来的反奸清算运动，一致认为在过去运动中，领导上的缺点仍是包办代替。在运动初期不敢放手让群众去搞，零敲碎打，没形成广大群众的运动；在运动末期形式上是大胆放手了，实际上仍没有跳出包办的思想圈子，只是放给了积极分子。在运动中还有先进村包办落后村的现象，落后村群众没发动起来，甚至造成村与村群众之间的对立，给予破坏分子很多破坏活动逃脱隐藏的空间。大会最后决议：一切事情大胆放手，交给群众自己干，干部积极分子只可引导检查，帮助群众推进运动。
