　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 4th: Washington dispatch: The great strike of 400,000 coal miners continues. If the capitalists continue to reject the reasonable demands of the workers, and this strike lasts for 60 days, according to official estimates from the Department of Commerce, more than five million workers will be unemployed, and industrial production will be reduced by 25 percent. If it lasts for 30 days, the coal shortage will cause 80 percent of railway services to be suspended, and steel mills to reduce production by 30 percent; other public utilities such as electricity will also be largely shut down, and national income will be reduced from 170 billion yuan to 150 billion yuan. Government authorities are planning to put pressure on the miners' leader, Lewis, and attempt to suppress the entire American labor movement. The Secretary of the Interior and other senior officials appeared in court to accuse Lewis of violating the law. Some observers believe that if this becomes a reality, it will fully expose the Truman government's complete alignment with monopoly capital, thereby arousing fierce opposition from various trade unions and liberals, just like the opposition to Truman's anti-strike emergency law this summer.

    继续罢工
    【新华社延安四日电】华盛顿讯：四十万煤矿工人大罢工仍在继续中，如资方仍拒绝劳方合理要求，此项罢工，如持续六十天，据商务部官方估计，将有五百万以上工人失业，工业生产将减少百分之二十五。如持续三十天，则煤荒将使铁路班次停开百分之八十，炼钢厂减缩生产百分之三十；其他电力等公用事业亦大部停顿，并将使全国收入从一千七百亿元减至一千五百亿元。政府当局正拟对矿工领袖路易斯施以压力，并图打击整个美国工人运动。内政部长等高级官员出庭控诉路氏违法。若干观察家认为此举倘成为事实，则充分暴露杜鲁门政府完全站在独占资本方面，从而引起各职工会与自由主义派方面之猛烈反对，正如今夏反对杜鲁门的反罢工紧急法一样。
