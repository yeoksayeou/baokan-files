Chenji is Revived!
Random Notes from Behind Enemy Lines

I followed the army into the rear of the Chiang army. The He(ze) Ju(ye) Highway – this important artery of the enemy – was surprisingly empty and unguarded. All that remained were the remnants of the Chiang army's disarray. Comrades discussed among themselves, saying, "Chiang Kai-shek's troops are insufficient. Such an isolated incursion will surely hasten his demise."

Arriving in Chenji street in Dingtao, it was silent, without even a shadow of a local. It was truly "ten houses, ten empty," with doors lying scattered haphazardly in the street. The Chiang army had trashed the place, turning it into something resembling a pigsty or dog kennel. When the locals who had fled to the countryside learned that it was their own Eighth Route Army who had arrived, they were happier than if they were getting married. Carrying on their shoulders, with ox carts, and wheelbarrows... they rushed back home. Before long, there were vendors selling sesame cakes, cigarettes, salt, cabbage, towels, socks... and the "dead street" was immediately transformed into a bustling market. The soldiers chatted warmly with the locals. Not only was the market lively and jubilant, but the surrounding fields also seemed to "come back to life." Women and children were in the fields, picking cowpeas, pulling scallions, and digging vegetables, to feed their own army. They happily sang songs of resistance against Japan. Chenji was revived.

At Shatu market in Yunju county, the Chiang army had only passed through briefly, but they had robbed the common people of everything. After the Chiang army left, the locals returned and used bundles of sorghum stalks to completely block their doors. The locals said, "This way, the Chiang army won't know where the doors are and won't be able to find anything." As the troops marched at night, when they arrived at Gaoyoufang, the locals automatically opened their doors, lit lamps, and stood at the door calling out, "Eighth Route Army comrades, come in and rest!" An old gentleman in his fifties said to me, "As soon as I heard the voices, and knew they weren't those brute grandsons (referring to the Chiang army), I guessed that it was our army coming. I hurried out to open the door and see. If it were the calamity army coming, I would have bolted the door tight and run away from the back wall."

Living in Shatu market, the landlady, old Mrs. Wang, said, "That day, I went out to visit relatives. As soon as I left the village, I saw troops coming from the southeast. I trembled all over, afraid it was the Central Army. Someone told me that it was our own Eighth Route Army, and then I was at ease. I happily turned back, gave up visiting my relatives, and came to greet our Eighth Route Army."

On October 24th, we arrived at Jianghai village. This was a village where the Chiang army had been stationed. Let alone planting wheat, the land was still bare and unplowed. The locals said, "In previous years, the wheat would have been planted a month or two ago. When the Chiang army came, they took all the strong livestock and even shot down three of our farmers with machine guns!" The Eighth Route Army stationed in Shatu market busied themselves helping the locals deliver manure, thresh grain, and lend livestock to the locals to plow their land and plant wheat. One local family, hearing that the Eighth Route Army was about to move out, ran to the team headquarters and pleaded, "Comrades, stay for three more days, and you'll help us finish planting the wheat. You can't leave yet."

As I walked back from Anxing market, I was with a group of locals pushing carts. When they talked about the Chiang army, they gnashed their teeth and cursed, "Chiang Kai-shek, that traitor, has made us suffer terribly. 'The hatred of killing one's father and seizing one's wife' cannot go unavenged." (Chao)

    陈集复活了！
    敌后散记
    我随军转入蒋军后方，经荷（泽）巨（野）公路——这条敌人重要的血管，竟然空空的没人防守，留下的只有蒋军狼狈的遗迹，同志们都纷纷议论说：“蒋介石兵力不足，这样孤军深入，它的死期一定快了。”
    到定陶陈集街里，鸦雀无声，连一个老乡影子也没有，真是“十室十空”，门板横七竖八的在街里倒着，这里被驻过的蒋军糟塌的像猪圈狗窝。逃到野外的老乡们，问清了是自家的八路军来了之后，喜的比娶媳妇还高兴，肩挑、牛驮、车推………纷纷回家，不大一会，街里便有卖烧饼、纸烟、盐、白菜、手巾、袜子………的了，马上由“死街”变成熙熙攘攘的闹市。战士们亲热的和老乡谈话。不单是集上热闹欢腾，连四周田野里也“回生”了，女人孩子在地里摘豆角、拔葱、刨菜，给自己军队吃。她们高兴的唱着抗战的歌子，陈集复活了。
    到郓钜县沙土集，蒋军只从这里路过了一下，便把老百姓抢光了，蒋军走了，老乡回来用成捆的高粱杆子，把门全遮着堵上，老乡说：“这样使蒋军不知道那里是门，啥也找不到了。”队伍夜行军，走到高油坊，老百姓自动开开门点着灯，站在门口叫：“八路军同志进家歇歇吧！”一个五十多岁的老先生对我说：“我一听说话，不是那些蛮龟孙（指蒋军），便猜到是咱军队来了，赶紧出来开门看看，要是糟殃军来了，我把门顶紧，从后墙就跑了。”
    住在沙土集，房东王老太太说：“那天我出门探亲戚，刚出村，见东南上来队伍了，我浑身发抖，怕是中央军，旁人告诉我，说是咱的队伍八路军，我心才定了，我高兴的转回来，亲戚不探了，招呼咱的八路军。”
    十月二十四日到蒋海村，这是蒋军曾驻过的村子，别说种麦，地还是光光的没有耕，老乡说：“往年麦子早种完个把月了，蒋军来了，牲口壮了全拉走了，还用机关枪打倒咱三个种庄稼人呢！”在沙土集驻的八路军，忙着帮老乡送粪，打场，借牲口给老乡耕地种麦，有一家老乡听说八路军要移防，便跑到队部里去请求说：“同志们再驻三天，就帮咱把麦子种完了，你们可走不得。”
    我从安兴集往回走，相跟一伙推着车子的老乡，一谈到蒋军，他们便咬牙切齿的骂“蒋介石这个卖国贼，可把咱遭塌苦了。‘杀父之仇，夺妻之恨’，不能不报。”（潮）
