    Taihang Third Special District Military Commission Announces
    Reward Measures for the Explosives Campaign
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch of the 11th] The Taihang Third Special District and District Military Commission, in order to launch a large-scale explosives campaign, have jointly issued reward measures regarding the explosives campaign: 1. For landmines and stone mines that are buried and stepped on by the enemy during an enemy attack, a reward of 200 yuan will be given for each detonation. 2. Those who go deep behind enemy lines and bury landmines on enemy transportation lines or near enemy bunkers will be rewarded 400 yuan for each detonation. 3. Those who, in a planned manner combined with sniper warfare, set up landmine positions and landmine networks, causing the enemy to fall into the trap and detonate them, will be rewarded 300 yuan for each detonation. 4. If a village has an explosives group or explosives team that continuously causes enemy detonations, in addition to a reward of 300 yuan per detonation, special awards will be given according to the circumstances. 5. Those who are creative in the manufacture and installation of landmines will be given rewards according to the size of their effectiveness. These measures have been implemented since the first day of this month. The bonus for items 1, 2, and 3 will be borrowed from the county government by the County Military Commission and reported to the county government for unified reimbursement at the end of the month. For the special awards in items 4 and 5, the County Military must first report the details of the process and then receive and issue them after approval by the District Military.
