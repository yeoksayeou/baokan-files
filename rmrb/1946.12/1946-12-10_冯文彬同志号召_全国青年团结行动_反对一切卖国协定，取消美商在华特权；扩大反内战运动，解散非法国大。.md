Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 7th: Feng Wenbin, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Youth Federation in the Liberated Areas, delivered a speech at the Yan'an commemoration of the "December 9th" and "December 1st" Movements. He first, on behalf of the youth of the Chinese Liberated Areas, paid tribute to the leaders of the "December 9th" Movement, Guo Qing, Ji Yuxiu, Huang Cheng, and Yang Xuecheng, and to the comrades who were massacred by Chiang Kai-shek's military police in the "December 1st" tragedy, Pan Qingchun, and the soldiers who died for the cause of democracy. (The entire audience stood in silent tribute.) He pointed out the persecution and massacres of the broad masses of youth in the KMT-controlled areas, and after citing the heroic struggle of the youth, he said: "The situation now is even more serious than the "December 9th" eleven years ago and the "December 1st" a year ago, but the strength of the Chinese people is also greater." He called on the youth of the whole country to inherit the glorious traditions of the past, unite closely and act urgently to carry out the following tasks.

    First: Oppose the Chiang-American commercial treaty and all traitorous agreements that sell out China, abolish all U.S. privileges in China, vow to wipe out the new national humiliation, and demand that the U.S. military and military advisory group immediately withdraw from China and stop all arms and material aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government!

    Second: Expand the anti-civil war movement, widely publicize the harm of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy, expose Chiang Kai-shek's false peace deception, and launch an anti-civil war movement of strikes, escapes, and uprisings within the Chiang army.

    Third: Oppose dictatorship, dissolve the illegal pseudo-National Assembly, restore the Political Consultative Conference line, implement political, economic, and cultural reforms, save the education crisis, and protect the youth's study, work, and life.

    Fourth: Go to the countryside to carry out peasant work and help peasants carry out various struggles for survival.

    Fifth: Youths should strengthen unity and mutual assistance in life and study to resist the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents.

    Sixth: Appeal to the youth of the world, especially the American youth, to demand that the United States withdraw its troops by all means and practical actions, and not give any assistance to the dictatorial, civil war-mongering Chiang Kai-shek government, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.

    Finally, he called on the youth of the Liberated Areas to actively join the army, actively engage in production, participate in various revolutionary work, smash Chiang's army's offensive, and use all their strength to support the heroic struggle of the youth in the KMT-controlled areas.
