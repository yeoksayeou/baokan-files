[This article was transmitted by our newspaper from the Taiyue region on the 16th] In the Taiyue and northern Henan regions, the masses' struggle against the reversal of settlements has achieved universal victory, and the people's armed forces are becoming stronger with each battle. In Meng County, in order to protect their homes and land, young and middle-aged people have joined the militia, actively attacking the enemy everywhere, and threatening the "reversal of settlements teams." A certain village militia assault group bypassed the Meng (County) Qin (Yang) highway at night and surrounded the "revenge team" in Beidong Village near the Jiang army stronghold in the northern section, capturing alive the "reversal of settlements team" members Zhang Fengtong, Hanqing, and others. On the night of the 4th, a unit of the militia even crossed the Ma River and raided Yusi Town, approaching the enemy blockhouse in groups, throwing 21 grenades in succession to demonstrate against the "revenge team" and "reversal of settlements team" stationed there. The "revenge team" hid in the blockhouse and dared not come out, causing the "reversal of settlements teams" in Hongdao and Luozhuang to move to the southern township. The "reversal of settlements teams" in Meng County and Houchun dared not come out to carry out "reversal of settlements" for a long time. Nanyao Village in Jiyuan County is the hometown of the great traitor Wang Tangyu. Village Public Office Secretary Wang Jingan, fearing the "revenge team," proposed to the masses: "To have peace, we must maintain both sides, otherwise I will not do it!" The militiaman Wang Xiaoshuang patted his chest and said, "I will be the village chief. Give me a few guns, and I will fight the 'reversal of settlements team' if they come!" The people's armed forces in Nanyao Village and other places have become more developed and strengthened. Wang Xiaoshuang often leads the militia to attack the enemy, shaking the four villages. The local bullies and landlords who were hiding in the village and trying to reverse the settlements all bowed their heads to them. A certain reactionary landlord even smiled and asked the village chief for forgiveness. Xiaoshuang humorously replied: "Don't call me village chief, please reverse the settlements!" Since then, more than 600 households in Nanyao Village have enjoyed a peaceful life. The "revenge team" and "reversal of settlements team" have not stepped into the village once.

    反倒算斗争普遍获胜
    孟县民兵到处主动打击“倒算队”
    济源王小双率领民兵迫使恶霸低头
    【本报太岳十六日电】太岳豫北地区群众反倒算斗争普遍获得胜利，群众武装愈战愈强。孟县群众为了保家保地，青壮年都参加民兵，到处主动出击敌人，威胁“倒算队”。某村民兵突击组深夜绕过孟（县）沁（阳）公路，包围北段蒋军据点附近之北董村“复仇队”，活捉“倒算队”张凤桐、汉卿等。四日夜，一部民兵更渡过马河袭入禹寺镇，分组逼近敌炮楼，连续投弹二十一枚，向驻该处之“复仇队”、“倒算队”示威，该“复仇队”钻进炮楼不敢出来，使洪道、罗庄之“倒算队”移住南乡，孟县城内及猴村之“倒算队”好久不敢出来进行“倒算”。济源县南姚村，是大汉奸王唐玉之老家，村公所书记王景安因惧怕“复仇队”，向群众提出：“要安宁须得两面维持，否则我不干了！”民兵王小双听了拍拍胸膛说：“我当村长，大家给我几枝枪，‘倒算队’来了跟他干！”南北姚村等地人民武装更加发展和壮大起来了，王小双经常带领着民兵，出击敌人，威震四乡，隐藏在村中企图倒算的恶霸地主都向他们低头，某反动地主并陪着笑脸请村长饶恕，小双幽默地回答道：“别叫我村长，请你倒算吧！”从此南北姚村六百余户群众，获得安宁的生活。“复仇队”、“倒算队”至今未曾进过该村一步。
