Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 12th: Chairman Yu Yifu of Nenjiang Province wrote an article commemorating the "Double Twelve" Incident. The article stated: "During the 'Xi'an Incident,' Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng proposed eight proposals for national salvation through resistance against Japan. The people of the whole country judged General Zhang Xueliang to be a loyal and heroic Yue Fei. Chiang Kai-shek's detention of General Zhang Xueliang for ten years was a breach of faith and righteousness." The article continued: "Ten years after the 'Xi'an Incident,' although Japanese imperialism has been defeated, American imperialism has come to make China its colony. Chiang Kai-shek has signed the traitorous Chiang-American Commercial Treaty and is acting as a new Qin Hui. This conspiracy has long been seen through by the Chinese people. His acts of selling out the country, dictatorial rule, and civil war will be smashed by the iron fists of the people across the country." The author also called for the release of Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng.

    呼吁释放张杨
    【新华社东北十二日电】嫩江省于毅夫主席撰文纪念“双十二”该文称：“西安事变”张学良、杨虎城两将军提出八项抗日救国主张，全国人民判明了张学良将军乃是忠贞英雄岳飞，蒋介石扣押张学良将军达十年之久，实属背信弃义。该文继称：“西安事变后十年的今日，日本帝国主义虽被打倒，但美帝国主义却又来使中国为它的殖民地，蒋介石订了卖国的蒋美商约，正在作着新的秦桧。这种阴谋，早被中国人民识破。他的卖国独裁内战的行为，必被全国人民的铁拳所打破”。作者并呼吁释放张学良杨虎城两将军。
