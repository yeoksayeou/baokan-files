Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. According to various news agencies, Soviet scientists and engineers have recently achieved many new successes. The scientific exploration team dispatched by the Ministry of Industry completed its lakebed mineral exploration work earlier this month, enabling the rational utilization of underwater mineral resources. In the industrial sector, Soviet scientists have invented a method to simplify the complex process of traditional steelmaking. Railway engineers have designed a 1,200-horsepower high-speed train that can travel 160 kilometers per hour and travel over 2,000 kilometers without adding water or coal, with manufacturing costs two times cheaper than ordinary trains. Naval engineers have recently used reinforced concrete to build barges, oil tankers, and floating vessels with a displacement of up to 6,000 cubic meters, and the cost is much cheaper than metal-made ones.

    【新华社延安十七日电】据各通讯社报导：苏科学家及工程界近又获许多新成就。工业部派出的科学探察队，已于本月初完成湖底矿苗探察工作，使水底矿源的利用臻于合理。工业部门方面，苏科学家已发明一种方法可简化老法炼钢的曲折过程。铁路工程师已设计一种一千二百匹马力的高速火车，每小时可驶行一百六十公里，行驶二千余公里无需加水加煤，其制造成本则较普通火车便宜两倍。船业工程师近用钢骨水泥建造驳船、油船及浮动船，其排水量可达六千立方公尺，且成本远较金属制成者便宜。
