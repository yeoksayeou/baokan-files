    【Changzhi 27th Dispatch】 Riverhead Village, Second District of Gaoyi, created an epic of heroism and tenacity in resisting Chiang Kai-shek's puppets. On the 12th, Chiang's army stationed in Beitian Kou Village, Zhao County, gathered more than 200 local secret agents and "Homecoming Corps" members and launched a surprise attack on our Riverhead Village at 9 p.m. They tightly surrounded the village headquarters and bombarded it with dense firepower, attempting to intimidate our village cadres and militia into surrendering their guns. However, our cadres and militia steadfastly and calmly climbed onto the roof of the headquarters, defended their fortifications, and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy. With two inferior rifles and dozens of hand grenades, they resisted an enemy ten times their size, repelling several enemy assaults. Our Village Chief Li Mengzhou, Militia Committee Director Li Sanquan, Land Reform Team member Li Chouzi, and other six comrades were all wounded. After being wounded, Li Chouzi continued to block the enemy's attempt to climb the roof, and was eventually injured again by a hand grenade explosion. After the six reinforcements from our Second Squad went to the roof, the enemy resumed their fierce artillery fire to cover their attack, and all of our rooftop fortifications were destroyed and all hand grenades were used up. However, the heroes who persisted in the bitter struggle still used the only remaining landmines, pulling the wires with one hand and bombing the enemy with the other. After running out of ammunition, they used bricks to smash the enemy. Liu Gongxue, an old farmer in his fifties who had been emancipated, saw that most of the comrades on the roof were injured and the situation was critical. With a shout, he led several young men to climb onto the roof, using bricks to knock down the secret agents who were climbing up. The old hero cursed as he fought: "Damn you, even if there are no bullets, bricks will kill a few of you." They persisted in this way for a long time, but eventually retreated into the room due to running out of ammunition and being injured. However, the wounded comrades still vowed to never surrender and prepared sticks to fight the enemy. The village chief, seriously wounded, handed over his gun to the women's team leader after firing his last bullet, instructing her to hide it quickly, and repeatedly encouraged everyone: "Resolutely do not yield to the enemy." Militia Committee Director Li Sanquan, before his death, praised the militia member Zhang Moli for his heroic sacrifice and good fighting, saying: "We are dying for the people, this is glory." Deputy Village Chief Liu Genxiang, although covered in wounds and unable to move an inch, refused to be captured even to his death. After the enemy rushed into the headquarters, they repeatedly intimidated and lured the comrades who were holding on to the room to come out and surrender their guns. Comrade Gao Yunxing, a Communist Party member of our Land Reform Team, led everyone to continue to persevere. The brutal enemy had no choice but to resort to arson, and all the comrades in the room were martyred. Afterwards, the masses of the village unanimously expressed their indignation and denounced the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's puppets to the entire county, vowing to avenge the dead. The Gaoyi Democratic Government also called on the militia masses of the entire county to swear to avenge the Riverhead martyrs and demand a blood debt from Chiang Kai-shek's puppets!

　　英勇顽强抗击蒋伪
    河头村干民兵至死不屈
  　高邑县府号召全县向蒋伪讨还血债
    【长治廿七日电】高邑二区河头村，创造英勇顽强抗击蒋伪的英雄史诗。十二日驻赵县北田寇村之蒋军，纠集地方特务及“还乡团”二百余人，于夜九时奔袭我河头村，当将村指挥部严密包围，以密集火力轰击，企图威吓我村干部民兵缴枪投降，但我干部民兵坚定沉着爬上指挥部之屋顶，据守工事，与敌展开激战。以劣等步枪二支，手掷弹数十颗，抗击十倍于我之敌，先后击退敌数次冲锋。我村长李孟周，武委会主任李三全，翻身队李丑子等六同志，全部负伤。李丑子负伤后仍坚持阻击企图爬房之敌，最后又被手榴弹炸伤。我第二班增援之六人上房后，敌复以猛烈炮火掩护，向我猛攻，我房顶之工事，全部被毁，所有手榴弹也已用尽，但坚持苦斗之英雄们，仍以仅存之地雷，一手拉线，一手炸敌人，弹尽后又用砖头砸击敌人。五十多岁的翻身老农民刘公学看见房上大部同志负伤，形势危急，一声呐喊，带着几个小伙子爬上屋顶，以砖头将向上爬的特务打了下去。老英雄边打边骂：“狗日的，没有子弹，砖头也打死你几个。”这样坚持了好久，终因弹尽伤多，逐步退集房内。但负伤同志仍誓死不屈，纷纷准备棍棒与敌抗击。村长负重伤，打完最后一颗子弹，即把枪缴给妇女队长，嘱她赶快掩藏好，并一再鼓舞大家：“坚决不向敌人屈服”；武委会主任李三全，临死前还表扬民兵张墨里英勇牺牲打的好，说：“我们是为人民而死、这是光荣的”。副村长刘根祥虽满身伤口，寸步难行，亦至死不当俘虏，敌人冲进指挥部后，一再威吓利诱坚守房内的同志出来缴枪，我翻身队共产党员高云兴同志领导大家继续坚持，残暴的敌人无可奈何，改用火攻，房内同志遂全部殉难。事后该村群众一致愤慨，向全县控诉蒋伪罪行，宣誓为死者复仇。高邑民主政府亦号召全县民兵群众，誓为河头死难同胞复仇，向蒋伪讨还血债！
