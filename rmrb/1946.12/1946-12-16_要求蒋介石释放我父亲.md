　　Demanding Chiang Kai-shek Release My Father
    Yang Zhengmin
    Editor's Note: The author of this article is the eldest son of General Yang Hucheng, and currently serves as the Deputy Commander of the Yanshu District.
    It has been exactly ten years since the Xi'an Incident, and General Zhang Xueliang and my father are still imprisoned. After the peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident, Chiang Kai-shek made a lot of promises such as "those who participated in the Xi'an Incident will not be held responsible," and "from now on, I will be fully responsible if there is another civil war in China," etc. Not one of these promises has been fulfilled. Taking General Zhang Xueliang and my father as examples, they have been imprisoned for ten and nine years respectively, and Chiang Kai-shek still has no intention of releasing them. There is no doubt that Chiang Kai-shek is a shameless and untrustworthy scoundrel.
    According to people who have seen my father in recent years, nine years of losing freedom have turned his hair white. My stepmother has a severe mental illness, and one of my younger brothers—Zhengzhong, who is now seventeen years old, has spent ten years of his schooling in prison with his father. From 1937 until now, Chiang Kai-shek has not allowed my father and his family to exchange a single letter. Three years ago, my grandmother passed away, and the family telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek asking him to allow my father to come home once to bury his mother, but he was also rejected.
    Chiang Kai-shek imprisoned General Zhang and my father, initially in Zhejiang, then moved them to Jiangxi, then Hunan, then Sichuan, then Guizhou, and recently to Taiwan. If Chiang Kai-shek still had a bit of humanity, or at least the basic personality of being a Chinese person, he should have released them long ago.
    Releasing General Zhang Xueliang and my father is not only my own wish, not only the demand of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army and the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, but also the demand of the officers and soldiers of the old Northeast Army and the old Seventeenth Route Army, as well as the people of the entire Northeast, the people of the Northwest, and patriotic democrats across the country. Ten years of experience have proven that the people's demands cannot be hoped for from the dictator's grace, but can only be won through the people's efforts. The demand to release General Zhang and my father is also the same. As far as the Northwest is concerned, all capable people in Shaanxi and the old colleagues of the Seventeenth Route Army must unite closely, take action, inherit the revolutionary tradition of the National Salvation Army, carry forward the spirit of the "Double Twelfth," rely on the strength of the vast army and people in the liberated areas and the national democratic movement, resolutely smash Chiang Hu's offensive, so that the entire Northwest people can see the light of day, and resolutely fight for the release of General Zhang Xueliang and my father, and the release of all patriotic people.

　　要求蒋介石释放我父亲
    杨拯民
    编者按：本文作者为杨虎城将军长公子，现任延属分区副司令员。
    西安事变到现在整整十年了，张学良将军与我父亲仍被囚禁。西安事变和平解决后，蒋介石满口承应“对参加西安事变之人员，一概不究责任”。“从今以后中国再有内战我负全责”，等等这些诺言，没有一条兑现。单就张学良将军和我父亲来说，他们已经先后被囚禁了十年九载，蒋介石仍然没有释放之意，蒋介石是个寡廉鲜耻不知信义为何物的小人，这是毫无疑问的了。
    据近年来见过我父的人说，九年来失去自由的生活，已使得他老人家须发皆白，我的继母已患很重的精神病，我的一个弟弟———拯中今年已经十七岁，他为了随侍父亲在牢狱中消磨了十年的入学时光，从一九三七年到现在蒋介石不许我父亲和家人通一字信，三年前我祖母逝世，家人电请蒋介石允我父亲回家一次，以便安葬祖母，亦被蒋拒绝。
    蒋介石囚禁张将军与我父，初在浙江，继而迁江西、而湖南、而四川、而贵州，最近又送到台湾，蒋介石若果还有一点人性，或者还有一些做一个中国人的起码人格，即就早应该释放他们了。
    释放张学良将军和我父亲，这不仅是我自己的愿望，不仅是东北民主联军西北民主联军的要求，亦是旧东北军与旧十七路军官兵以及全东北人民西北人民和全国爱国民主人士的要求。十年来的经验证明，人民的要求不能希望独裁者恩赐，而只能有由人民的努力来争取，释放张将军和我父的要求也是如此。就西北来说，全陕西有为之士，十七路的旧同僚，必须亲密团结起来，行动起来，继承靖国军的革命传统发扬“双十二”的精神，依靠解放区广大军民和全国民主运动的力量，坚决粉碎蒋胡的进攻，使整个西北人民得见天日，并坚决释放张学良将军和我的父亲，释放一切爱国志士而奋斗。
