    To Smash Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to attack and open up the Ping-Han Railway, Southern Hebei strengthens ideological mobilization. The Southern Hebei District Party Committee specifically notified party committees and study committees at all levels to organize all party, government, military, and civilian cadres to deeply study "On the Current Situation" and the report by Liu and Peng at the Yan'an cadre mobilization meeting, earnestly reflect, and truly infuse this fighting spirit into all work. The Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee has printed a large number of single copies of the aforementioned documents and distributed them to counties and regiments to assist cadres in their studies. When the Third Prefectural Committee studied "On the Current Situation," it felt that production personnel who had been scattered outside for a long time had a "it doesn't matter" peaceful illusion in their thinking because they often did not see newspapers. Therefore, the prefectural committee specifically decided to gather all the organ personnel for a short-term rectification. The rectification plan: (1) The leadership should first carry out ideological mobilization, and cadres should conduct a self-reflection; (2) Make reports on the current situation and ideological examination based on "On the Current Situation"; (3) After each report, focus on promoting democracy, free discussion, everyone raises questions, everyone solves them, and then the leadership will analyze and summarize based on the discussion until the thinking is straightened out; (4) After the thinking is straightened out, the whole will take an oath. In order to deeply recognize Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous crimes and the poisonous schemes of American imperialism, villages and towns everywhere are universally writing Chiang Kai-shek's twelve major traitorous crimes.
    [This newspaper, Taihang News] The Vanguard Theater Troupe of the Taihang Military Region departed in September to provide support to the troops on the front lines of northern Henan. After more than two months, it returned victoriously. In addition to the marching time, the troupe organized 16 evening gatherings for cadres, soldiers, the wounded and sick, miners, and the masses, with more than 30,000 viewers. In a certain brigade, five evening gatherings were organized in seven days. A certain company-level cadre in a certain regiment did not have a sufficient understanding of the self-defense war and was not in a very good mood, but when he watched the play "Comrade, You Have Taken the Wrong Path" at a cadre evening gathering, he burst into tears on the spot and shouted the slogan "Down with the reactionaries." The next day, he tearfully expressed to his superiors: "In the past, my understanding of the reactionaries was not sufficient. In the future, I will definitely be determined to sacrifice and fight to the end."

    粉碎蒋贼打通平汉企图
    冀南加强思想动员
    三地委机关人员集体整训
    【本报威县九日电】为粉碎蒋军进攻平汉企图，冀南加强思想动员。冀南区党委特通知各级党委、学委会，组织所有党政军民干部深入学习“论战局”及延安干部动员会上刘彭报告，认真反省，把这一战斗精神切实贯注到各个工作中去。区党委宣传部已将上述文件，印成大批单篇发到县团，以助干部学习。三地委机关研究“论战局”时，感到长期分散在外的生产人员，因经常看不到报纸，思想上存在着“不要紧”的和平幻想，为此地委特决定集合所有机关人员，进行短期整训。整训计划：（一）领导上先进行思想动员，干部都进行一次思想反省；（二）根据“论战局”作时事和思想检查报告；（三）每一个报告过后，着重发扬民主，自由讨论，大家提出问题，大家解决，然后领导上再根据讨论分析总结，一直到打通思想为止；（四）打通思想后，全体进行宣誓。各地群众为了深刻认识蒋介石的卖国罪恶及美帝国主义的毒谋，各村镇普遍书写蒋介石卖国十二大罪状。
    【本报太行讯】太行军区政治部先锋剧团于九月间出发至豫北前线劳军，历时两月余，胜利归来。该团除行军时间外，在前方月余，共组织干部、战士、伤病员、矿工、群众等晚会十六次，观众三万余人，在××旅七天内即组织五个晚会。某团一个连级干部对自卫战争认识不够，情绪不很好，但在某次干部晚会上看《同志你走错了路》一剧时，当场痛哭流涕，高呼：“打倒反动派”口号，次日即哭着向上级表示：“过去对反动派认识不够，今后一定抱定牺牲决心奋斗到底。”
