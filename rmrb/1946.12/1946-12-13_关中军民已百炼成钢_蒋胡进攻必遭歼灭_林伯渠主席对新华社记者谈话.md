    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 10th: Chairman Lin Boqu of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, in response to the large-scale offensive by Chiang and Hu's troops in the Guanzhong Sub-region, made a statement to reporters, saying that Hu Zongnan's large-scale offensive in Guanzhong is the beginning of Chiang and Hu's long-planned offensive against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Chairman Lin called on all military and civilians in the Border Region to immediately shift from war preparation mobilization to combat mobilization, unite to resist the enemy, implement the spirit of everything for the front line and for victory, launch a campaign of meritorious service, and fight to eliminate Hu Zongnan. Chairman Lin praised the self-defense capabilities of the Border Region's military and civilians, stating: Chiang and Hu have amassed more than 100,000 troops, actively deploying for an offensive against the Border Region. For over a month, they have only launched tentative skirmishes in our Border Region, reaching over sixty times, all of which have been bravely repelled by our Border Region's military and civilians, killing and capturing nearly a thousand Chiang troops, and arousing great anger among the military and civilians in the Border Region. The competition among troops to perform meritorious service and kill the enemy, as well as the mass participation of people from all walks of life in joining the army, participating in the war, contributing grain, eliminating traitors, explosions, and the scorched earth policy, are surging in every region; In a certain battle in @ County, soldiers of a certain unit repelled an attack by more than sixty Chiang troops with nine bullets and two hand grenades. In the mass participation campaign, several thousand farmers joined the army in half a month. The militia of @ County alone repelled seventeen attacks by Chiang troops in a month. In the battle of Liangzhang in Xinning County (new county, formerly the eastern county seat of Ning County) in the Guanzhong Sub-region, a model of our national self-defense war was demonstrated. In this battle, more than 200 Chiang troops were killed or captured. Hundreds of militiamen and regular troops fought side by side, and ×1,400 people rushed to the battlefield to guide the troops, transport supplies, carry the wounded, dig fortifications, deliver water and food, provide comfort and rescue, do laundry, and so on. Two hundred stretchers braved gunfire to rescue the wounded, and a transportation team of eight hundred animals shuttled between the front and rear. The self-defense army set up a dense network of sentry posts, and the broad masses set up a minefield like a starry sky. All this fully demonstrates that the military and civilians of our Border Region have the great power to defend the Border Region. The Border Region Government has decided to reward wartime heroes and models in various posts. Chairman Lin concluded by saying: Chiang and Hu dare to attack our Guanzhong, which has been tempered thousands of times, and they will inevitably be annihilated.
