[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taihang, dated the 8th] From the fall of Jiaozuo to the beginning of this month, in forty days, the Taihang region's army fought the enemy 323 times, eliminating over 5,900 enemy troops. This included 4,776 enemy killed or wounded, 1,253 captured, and the seizure of 19 artillery pieces of various sizes, 44 light and heavy machine guns, 751 rifles and pistols, and 91 animals. General Qin Jiwei, commander of the Taihang Military Region, who had just returned from inspecting the front lines, stated: These victories were all achieved at a small cost. For example, on November 4th, a unit of our army in northern Henan attacked Gaozhuang, Huixian County, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet Li Ying's troops, killing or wounding over 200 enemies, capturing 40 alive, seizing two mortars, over 50 rifles, and 23 animals, with only 30 of our soldiers wounded. The ratio of enemy to our casualties was eight to one. On the same day, another unit of our army pursued retreating enemies from the front villages of Qixian County, killing over 20 enemies and capturing 21 alive, with only three of our soldiers slightly wounded, the enemy-to-our casualty ratio being twelve to one. On the 15th, a unit of our army annihilated all the defending enemies, over 20 men, at Nanzhaotun, Huixian County, seizing one machine gun, three rifles, and three animals, with no casualties on our side. On the 12th, we attacked Beizhu Village, Boai County, wiping out all the defending "Home Returning Corps" of over 60 men, with no casualties on our side. On the northern front, our Shouyang local corps even created an exemplary battle case of zero to ninety. General Qin continued: From the surface, it seems that the enemy has occupied five of our county towns in the past forty days. However, if we carefully calculate, the enemy has paid the price of over four thousand casualties to gain these few empty cities, further forcing it to disperse more than four brigades of troops to garrison them. These Chiang Kai-shek troops hiding in their tortoise shells are passing a long and painful winter night in terror. Any slight movement of their main force doubles the risk of being annihilated. For example, when Chiang's 85th Division was transferred north last month, our Daoging troops took advantage of the enemy's emptiness, first annihilating over 500 men of the 529th Regiment of Chiang's 177th Brigade in the Wanshan area north of Qinyang, and then attacked Mucheng Muliandian in Wuzhi County, killing and capturing over 200 enemies. At the same time, another route of our army once occupied Luwangfen between Jixian and Xinxiang, directly threatening the heart of the Chiang Kai-shek army in northern Henan—Xinxiang. General Qin finally pointed out: Under the guise of the so-called ceasefire order, Chiang Kai-shek has once again launched a large-scale invasion of our northern Henan and southern Hebei regions, making its rear increasingly empty. The entire region's military and civilians must extensively launch guerrilla warfare, conduct achievement competitions, win more battles, and cooperate with the main force to annihilate the enemy.

    四十天内作战三百余次
    太行我军歼敌近六千
    以少胜多寿阳创零比九十范例
    秦基伟将军号召再接再厉
    【本报太行八日电】自焦作陷落至本月初，四十天内，太行我军对敌作战达三百廿三次，歼敌五千九百余人，计毙伤敌四千七百七十六人，俘一千二百五十三人，缴获大小炮十九门，轻重机枪四十四挺，长短枪七百五十一枝，牲口九十一匹。甫自前线视察归来之太行军区司令员秦基伟将军称：这些胜利，都是以小的代价获得的。举如：豫北我军某部，十一月四日袭击辉县高庄蒋伪李英部，毙伤敌二百余名，生俘四十名，缴获迫击炮二门，步枪五十余枝，牲口二十三头，我三十人负伤，敌我伤亡比例为八与一之比。同日，另一部我军追击淇县正面村落退窜之敌，毙敌二十余名，生俘廿一名，我仅轻伤三人，敌我伤亡比例为十二比一；十五日我某部于辉县南赵屯，歼灭全部守敌二十余名，缴获机枪一挺，步枪三枝，牲口三头，我无伤亡；十二日我袭博爱北朱村，守敌“还乡团”六十余人全部就歼，我无伤亡。在北线我寿阳地方兵团更创零比九十之模范战例。秦将军继称：四十天来的战局从表面看来，敌人占了我们五座县城，但仔细算算敌人前后用了四千余人的伤亡代价才换得这几座空城，更迫使它分散了四个旅以上的兵力担任守备，这些钻在乌龟壳里的蒋军，正恐怖痛苦渡着漫长的冬夜，其主力稍有调动，则被歼的危险性倍增，举如上月蒋八十五师北调时，我道清部队即乘敌空虚，先在沁阳以北万善地区，歼蒋一七七旅五二九团五百余人，继袭武陟县新城木栾店，毙俘敌人二百余，同时，另一路我军一度攻占汲县新乡间之潞王坟，直接威胁豫北蒋军心脏——新乡。秦将军最后指出：蒋介石在所谓停战令掩盖下，再度大举进犯我豫北冀南地区，其后卫益形空虚，全区军民要广泛的展开游击战，进行成绩比赛，多多打胜仗，配合主力歼灭敌人。
