[This report from the Ji-Lu-Yu Bureau on the 25th] Huang Commission Director Wang Huayun of our liberated area made the following statement after the Zhangqiu meeting: The Kuomintang side's key members of the Flood Control Bureau, including Deputy Director Qi, Chief of Engineering Department Yan, and Advisor Tadder, attended this Zhangqiu meeting. After seven hours of discussion, no results were achieved. The fundamental reason is that the gang of autocratic demon Chiang Kai-shek does not want to cure the Yellow River and save the people of Ji-Lu-Yu from disaster, but instead uses the Yellow River as their second major army for attacking the liberated areas. Therefore, although our side has repeatedly made concessions and tried to accommodate, on the issue of blocking the breach, we only asked for time to restore the embankments and postpone the blocking of the breach until June of next year. On the issue of embankment restoration, we only asked for a reasonable allocation of funds for embankment restoration, and that the funds for our embankment restoration this summer and the second batch of funds for embankment restoration should be paid in full by January of next year so that our side can rush to repair the embankments and save the people in the middle and lower reaches from drowning. However, this minimum demand was ultimately rejected by the Kuomintang side, and they did not propose any solutions to the problem. At this point, we can assert that they did not come here to inspect the Yellow River and solve any problems for the people, but rather to further paralyze the people, and, when they are caught off guard, to release the Yellow River water; their conspiracy is now clearly revealed. The people along the river in our Ji-Lu-Yu region must be highly aware, strengthen the self-defense and self-rescue movement, in order to crush Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy. Here, we warn Chiang Kai-shek's gang: the people's blood debts must be repaid with blood. Those who play with fire will burn themselves.

　　黄委会王主任发表谈话：蒋介石无意治好黄河
    此次“视察”乃欲麻痹我区沿河人民
    我们要提高觉悟加强自卫自救运动
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】张秋会议后，我解放区黄委会王主任化云发表谈话如下：此次张秋会议，国方堵复局要员齐副局长、阎工务处长、塔德顾问等出席，会议经过七小时之讨论，没有得到任何结果。其基本原因，就是专制魔王蒋介石的一群不是要治好黄河，使冀鲁豫人民免于灾难，而是把黄河作为他们进攻解放区的第二大军。故我方虽一再让步，委曲求全，在堵口问题上我仅要求给我们以复堤的时间，把堵口推迟到明年六月。在复堤问题上，我仅要求合理的分配复堤工款，今年夏季我复堤工款及第二批复堤工款，统于明年一月付清，以便我方赶修堤工，使中下游人民免于淹死。可是，这一最低限度的要求，终为国方所拒绝，而他们也未提出解决问题的意见。至此我们可以断言，他们这一次来不是要视察黄河，给人民解决什么问题，而是想进一步的麻痹人民，在猝不及防之下，把黄水放过来；其阴谋毒计已显然若揭。我冀鲁豫沿河的人民要高度的觉悟，加强自卫自救的运动，以粉碎蒋介石的阴谋。在此，我们警告蒋介石的一群：人民的血债是要用血来还的，玩火者必自焚其身。
