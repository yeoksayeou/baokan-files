　　Vigilance!
　　Chiang Kai-shek’s Planes Drop Delayed-Action Bombs Near Liaocheng
　　[Report from our Jilu Yu Branch, 2nd] American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes are constantly supplying the besieged puppet troops inside Liaocheng with ammunition. On November 30th, several Chiang Kai-shek planes flew over Liaocheng and dropped ammunition, totaling nineteen long boxes. All of them landed outside the city. Half an hour later, seventeen long boxes exploded one after another. The two unexploded boxes were found to be two ineffective delayed-action bombs after research. This matter should be taken seriously by all regions!

  　聊城附近蒋机投延性弹
    【本报冀鲁豫分社二日电】美制蒋机不断以械弹接济被围于聊城城内之伪军。上月三十日又有蒋机数架飞聊城投掷弹药，共投掷十九个长箱，全部落在城外，半小时后十七个长箱先后爆炸，未爆炸的两个长箱，经研究是两枚失却作用的延性弹，此事深值各地警惕！
