　　[Reported by this newspaper from Weixian on the 2nd] After Guantou Village in the Yuan Dynasty realized "land to the tiller," all the farmers in the village immediately held an ideological meeting. Yin Yuxing said, "In the past, I suffered from cold and hunger, and only had enough to eat in the autumn. It was really painful to think about it. Now I have become a middle peasant, with enough food and clothing. All of this was given to me by Chairman Mao. I will follow Chairman Mao forever, generation after generation." An Enxin said, "I used to be a poor laborer, less valuable than a dog in the hands of the landlord. Now I have turned over and become the village chief. Chiang Kai-shek is fighting a civil war and wants to attack the place where Chairman Mao lives. We must take up our homemade guns and cannons and wait for the dogs." Yin Xinliang said, "I was angry with An Zhigu. If it weren't for the democratic government telling the truth, my family would have been scattered long ago, and my flesh would have rotted long ago. If Chiang Kai-shek dares to attack our land, we must fight him to the death." A woman said, "Now that I have turned over, if Chiang's army comes, I will stab them with scissors." Finally, An Jingchao, the director of the Farmers' Representative Conference, jumped out of the crowd and said, "When Chiang Kai-shek's government was in power, the poor suffered. The Communist Party led us to turn over and have enough food and clothing. Now that we have turned over, we cannot be paralyzed and lazy. From now on, we must vigorously produce and save, set household plans, practice martial arts with the militia, support the front line, defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, and defend ourselves and Chairman Mao."

　　[Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue] The broad masses in the Yan Zhan area of ​​Huoxian County have experienced the truth that Chiang will be defeated and we will win from their own personal experience. Knowing that Chiang Kai-shek occupied a place but did not have the strength to defend it, they loved their troops—the Eighth Route Army—even more. During the autumn storage season, more than ten villages near Chengguan, under extremely dangerous conditions, tried to escape the surveillance of the Yan puppet troops, actively paid public grain to the democratic government, and overpaid more than fifty stones. They said, "This is a little bit of thought, considered as comfort to the troops." A certain village was discovered by the Yan puppet army, and the grain transporter was tied up and beaten severely, but he said, "Want to beat me into opposing the Eighth Route Army, that is harder than ascending to heaven!"

　　管头村农民饮水思源誓败蒋贼保卫毛主席
    【本报威县二日电】元朝管头村实现了耕者有其田后，全村农民随即召开思想会。尹玉兴说：“从前我受冻挨饿，每年只一个秋饱，想起来真难受；现在我上升成中农了，有吃有穿，这都是毛主席给的，我今后子子孙孙跟着毛主席走”。安恩信说：“我以前是个穷扛活的，在地主手里不如个狗；现下翻了身，也当了村长。蒋介石打内战，还要进攻毛主席住的地方，我们要拿起土枪土炮，等着狗儿的”。尹新亮说：“我与安之谷生气，如不是民主政府讲真理，我家早已失散了，我的肉也早沤烂了，蒋贼要进攻咱这块土，非和他拚个死活不可”。一个妇女说：“现在我翻了身，如蒋军来了，用剪子也得刺他几个”。最后农代会主任安景朝从人群中跳出来说：“蒋介石的政府在时，穷人活受罪；共产党领导咱翻了身，有吃有穿，现在我们翻了身，不能麻痹偷懒，今后要大力生产节约，订按家计划，民兵练武，支援前线，打退蒋介石的进攻，保卫咱们自己和毛主席”。
    【本报太岳讯】霍县阎占区广大群众，已从自己亲身经验中，体验到蒋必败，我必胜的道理。知道蒋介石占领了地方，没力量守下来，他们更热爱自己的部队——八路军。秋屯时城关附近十余村，在极端危险的情况下，设法逃过阎伪军的监视，踊跃向民主政府交纳公粮，并多交五十余石。他们说：“这是一点小心思，算慰劳部队的”。某村曾被阎伪军发觉，运粮人被捆去毒打一顿，但他说：“想打的让我反八路，那是比登天还难！”
