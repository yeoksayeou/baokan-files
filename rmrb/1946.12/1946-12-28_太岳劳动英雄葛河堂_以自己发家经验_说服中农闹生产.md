　　【This Newspaper, Taiyue, 25th Dispatch】Some middle peasants in the Sixth District of Tunliu, misled by the special agents' rumors that "after landlords are struggled against, middle peasants will be struggled against," were not in high spirits for production. Labor hero Ge Hetang, seeing that further delay would hinder next year's large-scale production, immediately propagandized to the masses: "You are not afraid, look at how I have made a fortune under the leadership of the Communist Party!" He introduced the situation of his family's prosperity through production this year: "My family, a total of ten people, hired three long-term workers, and the whole family worked together. Forty mu of land yielded more than thirty shi of wheat, and one hundred and sixty mu of autumn land yielded more than sixty shi of grain, more than ten shi of corn, twenty shi of beans, and more than twenty shi of miscellaneous grains, as well as more than one hundred and twenty jin of flax seeds and tobacco leaves. My family spun one hundred and fifty jin of cotton and wove more than one hundred and twenty zhang of cloth this year. The whole family has two sets of new clothes, and five quilts have been sewn. In sideline occupations, we raised ten cows, four donkeys, five sheep, and more than sixty chickens, a flour mill that grinds five dou a day, and raised nine large pigs, which were exchanged for fifty-two shi and five dou of wheat. We slaughtered a pig during the Mid-Autumn Festival and gave it to the families of revolutionary soldiers. Now there are still forty-eight pigs, large and small, and we still have more than forty shi of corn and fifteen shi of beans from last year, and forty shi of wheat. We haven't touched this year's grain yet, and we are living a good life, eating white flour every other day." After hearing his words, the middle peasants' concerns gradually disappeared, and they began to prepare for production.

    以自己发家经验
    说服中农闹生产
    【本报太岳二十五日电】屯留六区有些中农误信特务“斗了地主斗中农”的谣言，生产情绪不高。劳动英雄葛河堂，看到再不准备就要耽误明年的大生产，即向群众宣传：“你们不怕，你看我不是在共产党领导下发的财吗？”他介绍了今年一年生产发财的情形：“我家大小共十口人，雇了三个长工，全家动弹，四十亩地打了三十多石麦子，一百六十亩秋地，打了六十多石谷子，十多石玉茭，二十石豆子，还有杂粮二十多石，大麻子、烟叶一百二十多斤。家里人今年纺花一百五十斤，织了一百二十多丈布，全家大小都穿了两套新衣，还缝了五条被子，在副业上喂了十头牛，四个驴，五个羊，六十多只鸡，粉房一座，每天磨五斗，养九个大猪，换回了五十二石五斗麦子。中秋节杀猪一头，送给抗属，现在还有大小猪四十八个，还存去年的玉茭四十多石，豆子十五石，麦子四十石，今年粮食还未动，过着好时光，隔两天吃一顿白面。”中农听了他的话，顾虑逐渐消失，开始准备生产。
