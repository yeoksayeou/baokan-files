　　How to Carry Stretchers?
　　A Talk by District Chief Cui of Fan County · Geng Wu's Record
　　In the first two mobilizations in the Fifth District of Fan County, the stretcher-bearers would run away in panic at the sound of gunfire and bombing by airplanes. At that time, the cadres were very annoyed, thinking, "The soldiers are sacrificing their lives and shedding blood on the front lines to defend our border region, yet the masses run away when asked to carry stretchers. They are truly backward." As a result, there was coercion and commandism, but the masses became even more dissatisfied, and sometimes it would take half a day to gather them. After careful review, it was clear that we couldn't blame the masses for being "backward"; the problem was entirely that we weren't following the mass line. Originally, when mobilizing stretchers to the front, we would simply issue orders, wait for the stretchers to be assembled, the cadres would give a brief talk, and then set off, without the masses knowing where they were going, how far the road was, or what tasks they were accepting. Without ideological mobilization, the masses were not voluntarily supporting the front lines, so how could they not run away? We had to change this approach. So, we gathered twenty or thirty village cadres, organized them, and launched a propaganda blitz. According to the current war situation in the border region, we explained the importance of war support tasks, and also explained the problems with the previous mobilization methods. As a result, the mood of the masses stabilized. Originally, we couldn't even gather thirty stretchers in one sub-district, but after this propaganda and explanation work, we could gather fifty stretchers in half a day. Later, until the Battle of Juancheng, not a single person ran away each time. To carry stretchers well, we also had to seize the time for education on the way to the front, especially the cadres had to lead by example and play a exemplary role. For example, if you walk at night to where, to what place to stay, and what is the situation ahead, must be promptly told to everyone. If there are sick people in the stretcher team, they should be comforted and cared for. If the sick are well cared for, they will be happy and feel that being away from home and sick is better than being cared for at home. In addition, when camping, we should first find good houses for the stretcher-bearers to live in, and then find houses for ourselves. After all the houses are arranged, we should go to each house to see if they are sleeping well and if they are covered properly. If our cadres take care of the masses in this way, endure hardships and act as role models everywhere, the stretcher-bearers will be enthusiastic and energetic. The fact that our stretchers were carried relatively well later was due to a lot of organizational work. Each stretcher had at least one active person inside playing an exemplary role. When walking, the cadres should be well-equipped. For example, in a company, the company commander is in the front and the deputy company commander is in the rear; in a squad, the squad leader is in the front and the deputy squad leader is in the rear. In this way, the cadres are not far apart, and they can hear each other when walking and talking. If there is anything in front, it can be quickly transmitted to the back, and if there is anything in the back, it can be quickly transmitted to the front. The whole team is closely connected and does not fall behind. If we walk in the first half of the night, we should arrive at our destination before the people go to sleep, so it is easy to knock on doors and boil water for cooking. If we arrive at our destination at dawn, the people will have already eaten breakfast after the houses are allocated. At this time, we continue to cook, staggering the time with the people's cooking, which makes it convenient to use pots, bowls, and furniture. After eating, everyone sleeps, so they can rest quickly and the masses are in a good mood.

　　怎样带担架？ 
    范县崔区长谈·耕武记
    范县五区在头两次动员的担架，一听枪炮响，飞机一轰炸，胆小的乱跑。当时干部很恼火，认为“战士在火线上牺牲流血，拚着命保卫咱们边区，群众抬抬担架还向回跑，真是落后”。于是发生强迫命令现象，但群众也越不满意，有时半天也集合不起来。认真检讨，这不怨群众“落后”，毛病全在我们不走群众路线。原来在动员担架上前方时，都是下命令，等着担架集合起来，干部来谈一谈之后，带起就走，向那里去，路有多远，接受的啥任务，群众都不知道。没有思想动员，群众不是自愿的支援前线，怎样能不跑呢？我们必须改变这种方式。于是召集了二三十个村干部，组织起来，进行宣传突击。按照当前边区的战争形势，说明战勤任务的重要，并且解释过去动员方式上有毛病。这样一来，群众情绪稳定了，原来在一个小区动员三十付担架都集合不起来，经过这样宣传解释工作后，动员五十付担架一晌时间就集合起来了。后来直到鄄城战役时，每次没有一个跑的。要把担架带好，还得在往前方的路上抓紧教育，尤其是干部要以身作则，起模范作用。比如晚上走路走到了啥地方，要到什么地方住下，前面有些什么情况，都要及时告诉大家。担架队中有了病号，要很好的安慰他，照顾他。病号照顾周到了心里也高兴，觉得出门在外，生了病比在家照顾还好。另外宿营要先给担架队员找好房子住下，然后自己再住房子，房子都安排好了，自己再到各房子去走一趟，看看他们睡好了没有，被子盖好了没有，我们干部这样照顾群众，处处吃苦作模范，担架员也就热心有劲。我们后来担架带的比较好，费了一番组织工作，也有关系。每付担架上顶少有一个积极分子在里面起模范作用。在走路的时候，干部配备好，比如一个中队，中队长在前，中队副在后，一个分队，分队长在前，分队副在后。这样干部离的不远，走路传话都可听见。前面有啥事情很快就可传到后面来，后面有啥事情也很快传到前面去，全队联系的紧，不掉队。如果是上半夜走路，要在老百姓没有睡觉以前走到目的地，这样好叫门，也好烧汤做饭，黎明时走到目的地，分配好房子老百姓就吃过早饭了，这时我们接着做饭，正和老百姓做饭错开，使用锅碗家具都方便，吃罢饭大家睡觉，这样歇过来的快，群众情绪也很好。
