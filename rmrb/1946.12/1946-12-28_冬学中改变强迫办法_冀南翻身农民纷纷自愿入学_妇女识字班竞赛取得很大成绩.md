　　Changing the Coercive Methods in Winter School
    Jinnan's Emancipated Peasants Voluntarily Enroll
    Women's Literacy Class Competitions Achieve Great Results
    [Our Newspaper Weixian 26th Dispatch] After being emancipated, the masses in various places have flocked to winter schools. Cadres in Liulin Village, Qinghe, discussed their experiences from last year's winter school and determined a plan for running this year's winter school: organize a village winter school committee, conduct timely supervision and inspection, avoid coercion and commandism, and ensure it is voluntary. Winter school should be combined with production, conduct in-depth political education, and raise the awareness of the masses. After the masses deliberated and discussed this plan, a mass meeting was held on the 14th, and Yang Changtai took the lead by enrolling eighteen people on the spot, and thirty-five women also signed up to participate. In just one night, the organized masses of the entire village flocked to the winter school. Li Ruhai and Yang Jingxiang, old men in their sixties, also requested to participate in the winter school. The village's winter school officially started on the 15th of last month. The first lesson was about how people can achieve emancipation. Yang Changtai immediately led his group to start a discussion. Dazhuang Village adopted the method of persuasion to organize young women into the winter school to study how to engage in winter sideline occupations. After being emancipated, the women of Dongwang Township in Ningnan launched a learning competition. In addition to two hours of learning each day, the women also took time out from their busy schedules to practice writing new characters. Some used chopsticks as pens and rice soup as ink on the table while eating to practice. Others used needles as pens and scratched on the heated brick bed while doing chores. Liu Dianfeng, a women's representative from Dongzhen, brought back a few new characters every night after meetings and studied them with her daughter-in-law. Before, no one in her family was literate. Now, both she and her daughter-in-law can not only recognize and write more than fifty characters, but even her seventy-year-old parents-in-law have learned to write their names and the characters "Chairman Mao" and "Communist Party." In order to stimulate the women's spirit of competition, the leadership specially convened a women's (aged 16 to 35) literacy competition at Nan Township Elementary School on November 25th, and invited the principal of the senior elementary school and teachers from various villages to visit in order to promote and influence the entire county. A total of 669 young women attended on that day. The test time was six minutes, and the average result was that each person could write eighteen characters from memory. The highest was Lu Guizhen, who could write 118 characters from memory. The experience of Dongwang Township in Ningnan in carrying out the women's winter school literacy movement is: (1) Use reflections on the harm of illiteracy to enlighten thinking. Li Zhuanzi from Dongzhen said: "I used to be illiterate, and I spent a hundred-yuan bill as ten yuan. Having eyes was like being blind. Now that I have the opportunity to learn characters, why shouldn't I learn well?" Now she carries chalk with her every day and writes wherever she goes. Her writings can be seen everywhere on the walls of Dongzhen. (2) Appropriately put forward slogans: "Live one day, understand one day." "Being literate makes you a complete person." "Good members must attend winter school every day." "Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it." "Learn until you are old, even if you're not skilled, you're not clumsy." Popularize these slogans among the masses and turn them into practical actions. (3) Regular tests. After the literacy competition in the three towns, it was stipulated that the 10th of each month would be the competition period to prevent relaxation in learning.
    [Our Newspaper Weixian 26th Dispatch] Winter school teachers from thirteen villages in the east of Feixiang City gathered to discuss and found that winter school was out of touch with the mass movement, emphasizing literacy classes and neglecting political and current affairs classes. At the symposium, everyone unanimously agreed that winter school should be closely integrated with the mass movement, conduct enlightening education from the masses' own interests, so that they truly feel the benefits of winter school, pointing out that the masses are now being emancipated, and winter school should solve the ideological problems of the masses in the emancipation movement; the masses are now distributing the fruits of victory, so students should discuss how to distribute the fruits of victory; who should be taken care of, and how to consolidate the results of the struggle. It was also pointed out that the masses near Feixiang City have confused thoughts, cannot understand the future of the current situation, have low fighting spirit, and are willing to distribute money but not things when distributing the fruits of victory. Winter school should seize these specific issues to conduct education and break the masses' "change of dynasty" thinking. When women in Dongmapo started attending winter school, they were very interested; but because the winter school teachers themselves had feudal ideas and did not approve of women's liberation, they only taught a few new characters every day to get by, and the women felt that winter school could not meet their needs, so their enthusiasm cooled down. After the village cadres examined themselves, they listened deeply to the women's reflections, collected materials on women's labor, production, and improving women's status, and carried out education in conjunction with current affairs, and the women's learning enthusiasm turned to be high. Dongwang Township in Ningnan paid attention to combining with practical work from the beginning of winter school. Because the county was engaged in conscription work, the first lesson learned was supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. After explanation and reflection and discussion, everyone realized that their emancipation was exchanged for the blood and sweat of the soldiers on the front line, and they should treat the families of soldiers well, so that the soldiers at the front can fight against Old Chiang with peace of mind. Everyone unanimously passed a resolution to make up three mu of land for each family of soldiers, and everyone would do all the work. Agricultural member Jiang Baoxing said: "I am a plasterer. If the house of any family of soldiers is broken, I will repair it."

　　冬学中改变强迫办法
    冀南翻身农民纷纷自愿入学
    妇女识字班竞赛取得很大成绩
    【本报威县二十六日电】各地群众翻身后，纷纷拥入冬学。清河柳林村干部座谈去年冬学经验，确定今年办冬学的方案：组织村冬学委员会，及时进行督促检查、避免强迫命令，作到自觉自愿。冬学要结合生产、深入政治教育，提高群众觉悟。群众酝酿讨论了这个方案，十四日召开群众大会，杨长泰当场带领着十八人报名入学，妇女亦有三十五人报名参加，一夜的时间，全村有组织的群众一齐涌到冬学里来，六十多岁的老头子李汝海、杨京香亦要求参加冬学。该村冬学已于上月十五日正式开课，第一课讲的是人怎样才能翻身。杨长泰随即领导本组展开讨论。大柳庄采用了串连说服的方式，把青年妇女组织到冬学里来，研究怎样搞冬季副业。宁南东汪三镇妇女翻身后，展开了学习竞赛，妇女们每天除两点钟的学习外，并于百忙中抽暇练习写生字，有的在吃饭时用筷子当笔，饭汤作墨，在桌子上练习。有的在做活时用针当笔，在坑上划。东镇妇女代表刘殿凤每晚开会回去，还带几个生字走，和他的儿媳一同学习，以前他家本没有识字的人，现在他和儿媳不但能认写五十多个字，连七十岁的老公婆也学会了写自己的姓名和“毛主席”“共产党”等字。领导上为激发妇女们的竞赛精神，特于十一月廿五日，在南镇小学召开妇女（十六岁至卅五岁）识字竞赛大会，并邀请高小校长及各村教员前来参观，以便推动与影响全县。是日到场的青年妇女共六百六十九人，测验时间为六分钟，结果平均每人默写十八个字强，其中最多的是鲁桂珍，能默写一百一十八个字。东汪三镇开展妇女冬学识字运动的经验是：（一）以反省不识字的害处打通思想，东镇李转子说：“我以前不识字，拿着百元的票子当十元花，睁着两眼是瞎子，现在有了学字的机会，为啥不好好学呢？”现在她身上每天带着粉笔，走到那里写到那里。东镇的墙壁上，到处可以看到她涂写的字。（二）恰当的提出口号，“活一天，明白一天。”“识了字才是个完全人。”“好会员要天天上冬学。”“天下无难事，只怕心不专。”“作到老，学到老，一样不会不算巧。”把这些口号在群众间普遍酝酿，变成实际行动。（三）定期测验。三镇识字竞赛后，又规定每月十号为竞赛期，以防学习中途松懈。
    【本报威县二十六日电】肥乡城东十三个村的冬学教员集合座谈，检查出冬学与群众运动脱节，偏重识字课，忽视了政治课与时事课。座谈会上大家一致认为，冬学应密切结合群众运动，从群众切身利益上进行启发教育，使其真正感觉到冬学的好处，指出群众正在翻身，冬学应给群众解决翻身运动中的思想问题；群众正在分果实，就应叫学员讨论如何分果实；应照顾那些人，及如何巩固斗争成果。又指出肥乡城附近群众思想混乱，弄不清时局前途，斗争情绪不高，分果实愿分钱不愿意分东西，冬学应抓紧这些具体问题进行教育，打破群众的“变天”思想。东马坡妇女开始上冬学时，很感兴趣；但因冬学教员本身存有封建思想，不赞成妇女解放事业，每天只教几个生字应付过去，妇女们感到冬学不能满足自己要求有热情便冷落下来；经村干检讨后，深入听取妇女的反映，搜集妇女劳动、生产、和提高妇女地位等材料，配合时事进行教育，妇女们的学习情绪转趋高涨。宁南东汪镇的冬学，开始就注意到与实际工作结合，因为本县正搞参军工作，第一课就学的拥军优抗，经过讲解和反省讨论，大家都认识到自己的翻身是前线战士用血汗换来的，应该好好优待抗属，使前方战士安心打老蒋，大家一致通过给抗属每人补齐三亩地，一切劳动由大家去做，农会员江保兴说：“我是个泥水匠，那家抗属的房子坏了，我管修理。”
