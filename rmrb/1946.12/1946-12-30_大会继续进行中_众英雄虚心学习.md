    【This is reported from Taihang on the 25th by our newspaper】(Late Dispatch) The Second Taihang Heroes Congress is continuing. The exhibition halls for Land Reform, Production, Militia, and Current Events have been officially open to visitors since the 3rd, and the number of visitors is very high, reaching 10,000 every day. General Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army, visited the Congress and spoke to all the heroes, encouraging them to lead the people of the Liberated Areas to do a good job in all kinds of work and defeat the attacks of the reactionaries. Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government pointed out in his speech that although this Congress is for the Taihang area, it has a whole border region character, and the experience of the Taihang area can promote the whole border region. Comrade Li Xuefeng of the Taihang District Party Committee made a political report to the Congress. After analyzing the current situation and the historical situation of the past two years, he pointed out: "Today is precisely the stage of arduous defensive warfare. With one more effort, we can climb over the hilltop and reach the stage of counter-offensive and achieve victory." Therefore, it is necessary to launch guerrilla warfare, adhere to this year's participation in the war, killing the enemy, land reform, and production, and prepare for the victory of the counter-offensive. This requires the leadership of heroes, the help of model workers, the leadership of cadres in the whole region, the implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders, the unity of the army and the people, and the launching of a new hero movement to overcome today's difficulties and move towards our goals. Guard against arrogance and rashness, be careful and prudent, and we will surely win! We must win!
