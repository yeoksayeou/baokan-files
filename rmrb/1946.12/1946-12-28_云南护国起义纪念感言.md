Reflections on the Anniversary of the Yunnan National Protection Uprising
　　Pan Shoduan

　　Thirty-one years ago today—December 25th—was the day when Cai E, Tang Jiyao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and others launched the uprising in Yunnan, supporting the Republic and opposing autocracy and dictatorship. At that time, China had a national thief, Yuan Shikai, who wanted to restore the autocratic system and become a dictatorial emperor. He did not hesitate to sell out national sovereignty and the interests of the people, signing the traitorous Twenty-One Demands with Japanese imperialism, changing the Republic to the Hongxian Empire, and using feudal titles and all kinds of vile means to lure a group of shameless warlords to "defend the Hongxian Empire." Because Yuan Shikai's actions violated the interests of the people, no one in China, except for a few unconscionable warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians, did not hate him. Cai E, Tang Jiyao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and others, with deep revolutionary ideas, responded to the people's call and launched an uprising in Yunnan on December 25th, in the fourth year of the Republic. They sent troops to Sichuan and Guizhou to fight against Yuan Shikai and his dog-leg warlords. In this military action, the people of Yunnan provided all possible human and material assistance. Because this uprising and expedition conformed to the demands of the Chinese people, the Yunnan army, though small, was able to defeat several of Yuan Shikai's dog-leg warlords in less than a year, and Yuan Shikai's imperial dream ended, and he died! The Republic of China was saved from becoming an autocratic "Hongxian Empire," thanks to the Yunnan National Protection Uprising led by Cai E and others to fight against Yuan. Therefore, some people call the Yunnan National Protection Memorial Day the "Republic Restoration Memorial Day."

　　Yuan Shikai has been overthrown for thirty years, and now China has a second national thief like Yuan Shikai, Chiang Kai-shek. For his personal interests and the interests of their Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen fascist clique, Chiang Kai-shek does not hesitate to betray the country, dictatorship, and civil war. The Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, which he signed with American imperialists, is an unprecedented traitorous treaty in China, selling out national sovereignty and national interests ten times and a hundred times more than Yuan Shikai's Twenty-One Demands. Chiang Kai-shek also knows that the Chinese people need democracy and peace, and that dictatorship and civil war are not liked by the people, so he plays tricks, using a group of bureaucratic politicians and lackeys bought with benefits to convene the so-called Chiang-style National Assembly, wanting to use this "National Assembly" to disguise his dictatorship as democracy and his reactionary, anti-people civil war as a legitimate supreme charter. He is clearly betraying the country, clearly engaging in dictatorship and civil war, but he insists on saying that he is "patriotic," that he is for "democracy" and "peace." Isn't this a genuine, veritable, and absolutely certain national thief and robber?

　　The Chinese people are not so stupid as to be deceived by Chiang Kai-shek. The Chinese people already know that Chiang Kai-shek is a national thief and robber, the second Yuan Shikai. Therefore, as we commemorate the 31st anniversary of the Yunnan National Protection Uprising today, we should inherit the spirit of the Yunnan Uprising led by Cai E and others, resolutely oppose the disguised public opinion of the Chiang-style "National Assembly," and resolutely oppose the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, which sells out national sovereignty and national interests. We want to strive for our country's independence, democracy, and peace, and seek the liberation of all Chinese people. Therefore, we should use the spirit of overthrowing Yuan Shikai and recreating the Republic to oppose the fascist regime headed by Chiang Kai-shek and establish a new Republic of China that is independent, democratic, and peaceful, as needed by all the people of the country.

### 云南护国起义纪念感言

　　云南护国起义纪念感言
    潘朔端
    三十一年前的今天——十二月二十五日，是蔡锷、唐继尧、朱总司令等在云南起义，拥护共和，反对专制独裁的一天。当时中国出了个窃国大盗袁世凯，他想恢复专制制度，作独裁皇帝，不惜出卖国家主权及全国人民利益，与日本帝国主义者订立卖国条约二十一条，并改共和为洪宪，用封侯封王及一切卑劣的利禄引诱手段来笼络一群无耻军阀们替他们“保卫洪宪江山”。袁世凯这一行动，因为是违反人民利益的，所以全中国人民除少数丧尽天良的军阀官僚政客外，无一人不痛恨。当时深具革命思想的蔡锷、唐继尧、朱德总司令等，遂应人民之请，于民国四年的十二月二十五日在云南起义，并分别出兵四川、贵州两地讨伐袁世凯及其狗腿军阀们。在这一讨伐的军事行动中，云南的人民是尽了一切人力物力之帮助的。因这次起义出师讨伐，是合乎中国人民要求的，所以云南军队虽少，而能在不到一年间，即将若干袁世凯的狗腿军阀们击溃，而袁世凯的皇帝迷梦亦就此结束，并且一命呜呼！中华民国之所以不再沦为专制的“洪宪帝国”，实有赖于蔡锷等所领导的云南护国起义出师讨袁，所以有人又将云南护国纪念日叫做“再造共和纪念日”。
    袁世凯被打倒已经三十年了，现在中国又出了第二个像袁世凯一样窃国卖国的蒋介石。蒋介石为了他个人的利益，为了他们蒋宋孔陈少数法西斯集团的利益，不惜卖国，不惜独裁与内战，他与美帝国主义者所订立的通商条约，是中国空前的卖国条约，比袁世凯的二十一条还要十倍百倍的出卖国家主权与民族利益的。蒋介石也知道中国人民需要民主与和平，独裁和内战是人民所不喜欢的，所以他就玩弄把戏，利用一群官僚政客及用利禄买来的走狗们，大开起所谓蒋记国民大会，想利用这个“国民大会”将他的独裁粉饰成为民主，将他那反动的反人民的内战粉饰为合法的最高宪章。明明是卖国，明明是独裁与内战，而他偏偏要说是“爱国”，他是“民主”与“和平”，这样还不算货真价实千真万确的卖国窃国的大强盗吗？
    中国人民不是那么蠢，不会受蒋介石的骗。中国人民已经知道蒋介石是卖国窃国的大强盗，是袁世凯第二了。所以我们今天纪念云南护国起义三十一周年，应继承蔡锷等云南起义的精神，应坚决反对伪装民意的蒋记“国大”，坚决反对出卖国家主权民族利益的中美通商条约。我们要争取我们国家的独立民主与和平，要谋全中国人民的解放，所以我们应以打倒袁世凯再造共和的精神，来反对以蒋介石为首的法西斯政权，建立全国人民需要的独立民主和平的新中华民国。
