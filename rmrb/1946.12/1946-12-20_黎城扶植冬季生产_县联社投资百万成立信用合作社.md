　　Licheng Supports Winter Production
    County Cooperative Invests One Million to Establish Credit Cooperative
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] In order to support the masses' winter production and prepare for a larger-scale production movement next year, the Licheng County Government has approved the county cooperative to establish a credit cooperative with one million yuan of capital. On the one hand, it absorbs idle funds from individuals or organizations, and on the other hand, it provides low-interest loans to groups or individuals in agriculture, industry, and commerce. When the cooperative opened for business on the 9th of this month, it announced the deposit and loan methods as follows: (1) Deposits held for ten days will accrue interest at a rate of 2%; those held for twenty days will accrue interest at a rate of 2.5%; those held for one month will accrue interest at a rate of 3%; those held for three months will accrue interest at a rate of 4%; and those held for more than three months will accrue interest at a rate of 4.5%. (2) Loans generally should not exceed one month. Interest is calculated on a daily basis. The interest rate depends on the purpose of the loan. For example, textile loans will accrue interest at a rate of 3% per month; agricultural production loans will accrue interest at a rate of 3.5% per month; cooperative loans will accrue interest at a rate of 4%; and commercial loans will accrue interest at a minimum rate of 5%. If loans are used for speculative trading, they will be recalled at any time upon discovery. (Licheng United Office)
