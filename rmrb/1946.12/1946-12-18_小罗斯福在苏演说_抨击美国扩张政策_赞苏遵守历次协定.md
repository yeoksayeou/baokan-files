　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: A delayed dispatch from New York: At a banquet held in the American Embassy in Moscow at the end of last month, Elliot Roosevelt, son of the late US President Franklin Roosevelt, delivered a speech criticizing the current US foreign policy. In his speech, Roosevelt Jr. asked the audience: "Can anyone here cite an example that shows the United States' actions are promoting peace?" After a moment of silence, an American reporter said: "Isn't the United States doing everything it can to strengthen the power of the United Nations?" Roosevelt Jr. immediately replied: "You are as aware of this issue as I am, that American support for the United Nations is purely for selfish and imperialistic reasons." Roosevelt Jr. also said: "The Soviet Union has never broken its promises, while the United States and Britain have repeatedly violated the solemn oaths of the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam agreements they signed, in stark contrast to the Soviet Union's faithful adherence. The Soviet Union should establish friendly regimes in its neighboring countries to counter the expansionist policies of the United States and Britain." He added: "The United States has no need to meddle in the Danube region, and the Soviet Union should have significant control over the Black Sea Straits. It would be foolish for the Soviets to agree to the internationalization of the aforementioned two locations unless the United States also agrees to the internationalization of the Panama Canal, and Britain agrees to the internationalization of the Suez Canal and Gibraltar." It is reported that Roosevelt Jr. arrived in the Soviet Union on the 12th of last month.

　　小罗斯福在苏演说
    抨击美国扩张政策
    赞苏遵守历次协定
    【新华社延安十五日电】纽约迟到消息：上月底，美故总统罗斯福之子伊里奥特·罗斯福，曾在莫斯科美驻苏大使馆内一次宴会中发表抨击美国现行外交政策之演说。小罗斯福于演说中对听众发问：“在场各位中，能否有人举出一例，可以指出美国之行动乃为增进和平者”？在片刻静默后，一美国记者说：“美国不是在尽一切力量增强联合国之权力么”？小罗斯福立即答称：“君清楚此一问题，正不下于我美国之拥护联合国纯为自私与帝国主义之理由”。小罗斯福又说：“苏联从未毁其诺言，而美英却一再违反其签订之德黑兰、雅尔塔及波茨顿协定之信誓，与苏联之忠实遵守适成对照。苏联自应在其邻近各国建立友好政权，以便对抗美英扩张势力政策”。并称：“美国在多瑙河区域无多管闲事之必要，苏联在黑海峡应有一大量控制权，如苏人同意上述两地国际化，即属愚不可及。除非美国亦同意巴拿马运河，英国亦同意苏伊士运河及直布罗陀之国际化”。按小罗斯福系于上月十二日抵苏。
