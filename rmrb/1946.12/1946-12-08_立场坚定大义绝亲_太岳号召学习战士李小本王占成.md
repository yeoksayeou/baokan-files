　　Firm Stance, Righteousness Prevails Over Family Ties
    Taiyue Calls for Learning from Soldiers Li Xiaoben and Wang Zhancheng
    [Report from this newspaper] The 21st Sub-district of Taiyue launched the Li Xiaoben and Wang Zhancheng movement to uphold righteousness and incorruptibility. Comrade Li Xiaoben's mother, deceived by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents' propaganda, went to the army twice to call Li Xiaoben home. Comrade Li Xiaoben sternly refused and exposed them, expressing his determination to carry the revolution through to the end. Comrade Wang Zhancheng, a bugler, had a father who was a puppet village chief for Yan Xishan's regime. Wang Zhancheng stated that his father "betrayed the people" and "should be sent to the government for execution according to the law," and "declared the severance of the father-son relationship." When the 21st Sub-district launched the Li Xiaoben and Wang Zhancheng movement, it pointed out: the environment will become more complex and the struggle will become more acute. All comrades in our military sub-district should learn from Comrades Li Xiaoben and Wang Zhancheng, learn their firm stance, high level of class consciousness, and high level of political vigilance, thoroughly crush Yan Xishan's vile and shameless methods, and strive for the victory of the overall resistance.

　　立场坚定大义绝亲
    太岳号召学习战士李小本王占成
    【本报讯】太岳二十一分区展开守正不阿的李小本王占成运动。战士李小本同志的母亲受了蒋特的欺骗宣传，接连两次去部队叫小本回家，小本同志严词拒绝，并予以揭破，表示坚决革命到底。司号员王占成同志的父亲是阎伪村长，王占成因他“背叛了人民”，表示“应该送到政府依法令执行。”并“声明脱离父子关系”。二十一分区号召开展李小本王占成运动时指出：今后环境将更复杂，斗争将更尖锐，我全军分区同志应向李小本王占成同志学习，学习他们那种坚定立场，高度的阶级觉悟和高度的政治警觉性，彻底粉碎阎伪卑鄙无耻手段，争取全面抵抗的胜利。
