　　Experiences in Fruit Distribution Across Various Regions
    Need-Based Supplementation is the Best Method
    [This Newspaper Report] A compilation of reports from various regions carried in this newspaper in November concerning methods for distributing the fruits of struggle reveals that the practice of "leveling" and "supplementing" according to need has won widespread support from the masses. The experience of the Linqi Land Reform Team in northern Henan is to first propagate the ideas of "leveling" and "supplementing" to the masses, defining the principles as "leveling the destitute, supplementing the poor peasants, and taking care of the middle peasants." Then, integrate bottom-up democratic discussions with top-down evaluations to determine which households should be leveled. As for how much should be leveled, it should depend on the amount of fruits of struggle. However, in general, it should first be leveled according to the average number of mu of land per person in the entire village, and then gradually increased according to rank. Gaoping had taken many detours in the past half-year before gradually finding the method of leveling and supplementing that was unanimously supported by the masses. Their development process was as follows: First, distribution was based on participation in struggle sessions and the degree of activeness, resulting in the majority of the masses not being emancipated. Second, the method of returning all confiscated property to its original owners was adopted, resulting in wealthy farmers who had gone bankrupt during the War of Resistance receiving more fruits from anti-traitor confiscations than their pre-war assets, while the majority of destitute peasants remained the same. Third, rent reduction and debt liquidation fruits were given to individuals, while anti-traitor and anti-hegemon fruits were given to the public, resulting in some not being enthusiastic about anti-traitor struggles and others not being interested in rent reduction and debt liquidation. Fourth, fruits were given to the charity granary for the purpose of providing relief to the poor, preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers, and buying guns for the militia, resulting in poor peasants not being emancipated and individual cadres having the opportunity to abuse funds. Fifth, after the fruits were returned to their original owners, those with more land lent a portion to poor peasants at half the prevailing interest rate, resulting in the formation of new debt relationships. Sixth, the method of everyone being emancipated through leveling and supplementing: distribution based on need, divided into five classes and ten grades, starting from the destitute and families of military personnel, with households receiving fruits accounting for more than 70% of the total number of households, which the masses were very satisfied with. Jincheng also went through three stages, ultimately proving that the method of leveling and supplementing according to need was the best. As for how to carry out the distribution, generally a evaluation committee is organized, with small groups discussing and electing impartial individuals to serve as evaluation committee members, assessing the quality of the land and the prices of movable property, and then finalized through mass discussion. The way of dividing classes and grades varies according to the actual situation in each region. The method of Zhizhong Village in Quzhou is: land is leveled according to the number of people, and items are divided into three classes and nine grades. For example, families of poor revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are in the first class, poor peasants are in the second class, and middle peasants are in the third class. Within each class, further divisions are made into three grades based on the actual living conditions, wealth status, performance in the struggle, and the number of people participating in the struggle. In other parts of southern Hebei, the general standard is based on the average amount of land per person in the whole family, plus factors such as whether life is difficult, the quality of the land, the availability of labor, and the existence of sideline production. Each class is further divided into three grades. In addition, after mass discussion, families of martyrs, soldiers and veterans are taken care of, and a little more is distributed to them, but not too much. Regarding the issue of victims and activists in the struggle: generally, a caring approach is adopted. Activists in places such as Quzhou are elected by the masses and given honorary or material rewards. In Xitao, Wuzhi, to reward those who spoke out about their grievances, each was given an extra two dou of grain during the distribution of fruits according to the agreed-upon grade. In this way, the problem of how to satisfy the victims and activists participating in the struggle has also been well resolved. In addition, Neiqiu distributes land to farmers who have no land or little land according to the amount and quality of land each household currently has, and implements "giving good land to those who have bad land, giving bad land to those who have good land, giving distant land to those who have near land, and giving near land to those who have distant land." In this way, the distribution is fair, and everyone gets land.

　　各地分果实经验
    按需填补办法最好
    【本报讯】综合十一月份本报所载各地分配斗争果实的办法，均系采用按照需要实行填平补齐，博得群众普遍拥护。豫北联系临淇翻身队的经验是：先向群众宣传“填平”、“补齐”的思想，确定“填平赤贫，补足贫农，照顾中农”。然后把自下而上的民主讨论，与自上而下的评议结合进行，看那些户应该填平。至于该填多少，应看斗争果实多少而定。不过一般应先按全村每人平均土地亩数填平，以后再按等往上加。高平半年来曾走过不少弯路，才逐渐找到了为群众一致拥护的填平补齐的办法。他们的发展过程是：第一、按参加斗争会与积极程度分配，结果多数群众均未翻身。第二、采用清算所得各归原主的办法，结果抗战期间破产的富农经反奸清算，所得果实比战前财产还多，而大部分赤贫农依然如故。第三、减租清债果实归私人，反奸霸果实归公，结果有的对反奸不积极，有的对减租清债没兴趣。第四、果实归义仓，作救济贫苦、优抗及民兵买枪用，结果贫苦农民未翻身，反予个别干部以滥支滥用的机会。第五、果实各归原主后，让地多的按地价贷给贫苦农民一部分，按分半行息，结果形成新的债务关系。第六、大家翻身填平补齐办法：按需要分配，分五等十级，从赤贫、军属往下推，分得果实户占总户数百分之七十以上，群众都很满意。晋城也经过三个阶段，最后同样证明按需要进行填平补齐的办法最好。至于如何进行分配，一般都是组织评议委员会，由小组讨论，选举公正人充任评议委员，评定土地的好坏，浮财的价格，由群众讨论最后确定。关于如何分等分级，则按各地实际情形而有不同。曲周致中寨的办法是：土地按人填，物品分三等九级。如贫苦烈抗军干属为头等，贫苦农民为二等，中农为三等。各等里面再按家庭实际生活，财富状况，并视其在斗争中之表现及参加斗争人数等再各分为三级。冀南其他地方一般的标准是以全家每口人平均多少地为主，再加以生活是否困难，土地好坏，有无劳动力，有无副业生产等条件，每等再分三级。另外，再经群众讨论，照顾烈荣军干属及在会群众，多分一点，但不可过多。关于斗争中的苦主及积极分子问题：一般都是采取照顾的办法。曲周等地的积极分子经群众选举，予以名誉或物质奖励。武陟西陶为奖励诉苦人，分果实时各按议定等级增加二斗粮。这样，如何使参加斗争的苦主与积极分子满意的问题，也得到了很好的解决。另外，内邱依照各户现有土地的多少与优劣，先分给没地或少地的农民，并实行“有好地的分坏地，有坏地的分好地，有远地的分近地，有近地的分远地”。这样，分配公平，人人获得土地。
