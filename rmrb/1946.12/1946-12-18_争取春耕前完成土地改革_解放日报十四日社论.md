Strive to Complete Land Reform Before Spring Plowing
*Liberation Daily* Editorial, 14th

For the past six months, a massive land reform movement to realize "land to the tiller" has been carried out in the liberated areas. This is a major event of unprecedented historical significance. Land reform is the most important content of China's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution. Truly implementing "land to the tiller" liberates more than 80 percent of the country's population from the bloody exploitation of foreign imperialism and domestic feudal forces, and transfers land from the hands of feudal exploiters back to the hands of peasants, making it the private property of peasants. This will "enable agriculture to advance from a backward level to a modern level, thereby providing a market for industry and creating the possibility of transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country" (Mao Zedong). The experience of land reform in the liberated areas fully proves that as long as the land "returns home" and the peasants obtain their "lifeline" and "food bowl," the peasants' enthusiasm for production will be unprecedentedly high, and the production volume will be greatly increased. Some places have already achieved a surplus after tilling three parts of the land, and some have even achieved a surplus after tilling only one part. Rural poverty is eliminated, begging and theft disappear, and a large number of hired and poor peasants are promoted to middle and rich peasants. The market is thriving, and small industries are booming. This prosperous scene in the liberated areas is an indicator of an independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong New China.

At the same time, implementing land reform in the liberated areas today is also a major key to crushing the Chiang Kai-shek troops' offensive and winning a comprehensive victory in the resistance. The experience of more than five months of self-defense war has proved that the better the land reform is done, the more resolute the masses participate in the patriotic self-defense war, and the more victories are won. For example, after the peasants in Jiangsu and Anhui were emancipated, their enthusiasm for participating in the war was very high. In the Xin Jie area of Taixing, more than 5,000 hired and poor peasant households each received more than three mu of land, and then 940 people automatically joined the army, and another 800 people poured into the militia. In the Beixuanjiabao battle in Taixing, 12,000 peasants participated in stretcher transportation, almost all the able-bodied men participated in the war. In Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, more than 10 million peasants obtained land, and the militia developed to more than 2 million. Thousands upon thousands of emancipated peasants poured into the main force, and each county established emancipated battalions and emancipated regiments as a powerful local armed force to participate in the battle. As General Liu Bocheng said: "The main factor in our army's victory lies in the vigorous morale of our army. This is because we are waging a just war of self-defense. The soldiers are all emancipated peasants, and they are fighting to defend their emancipation achievements, so they all bravely move forward in battle, with one acting as ten!"

Taking Jidong as an example, the guerrilla warfare in the region has been very successful in the self-defense war, and the reason lies in the thorough land reform. In the 24 counties of the region, 3 million people have obtained land, and the masses are very enthusiastic about joining the army. The militia has fought at least 1,500 times in each military sub-district in the past three months. The militia in Zunhua county fought 112 times in one month, killing, wounding, and capturing 88 enemies. Especially in covering the transfer of the masses, monitoring special agents, and preventing defection to the enemy, the role is extremely important. So far, the enemy in Zunhua can only be trapped in isolated cities, and few people in the villages have defected to the enemy.

The experience of the past six months has proved that a certain concept is incorrect. That concept believes that it is impossible to carry out land reform movement at the same time in the self-defense war; to carry out the self-defense war, one must relax the land reform, and that the self-defense war and the land reform are two stages of work, etc. What is the fact? The fact shows that the self-defense war urgently requires vigorous revolutionary energy, and land reform is precisely the source of providing this energy. In the central area of Qinyuan County, Shanxi, it was originally difficult to mobilize porters, but later, after the land reform was implemented, the peasants were all assigned land, and they all automatically and enthusiastically participated. Even the wages they originally received had to be returned to the public, which is a very good proof. On the other hand, the self-defense war, to a certain extent, can further encourage the peasants to emancipate themselves and protect the land reform. The better the land reform is combined with the self-defense war, the more successful the land reform and the self-defense war will be. The peasants in Jiangsu and Anhui, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, Shandong, and Jidong have made many new creations in this regard. They implement the policy of holding a gun in one hand and dividing the fields in the other in the border areas, while adhering to the policy of guerrilla warfare and land reform. For example, the peasants in a certain township in Nantong, Jiangsu, resolutely attacked the "home-returning corps" who went to the countryside to plunder with weapons, and at the same time launched a thirteen-night liquidation movement, and all the peasants got land. When the peasants in a certain county in the first district of Jiangsu were holding a meeting to liquidate the land of the local bullies, they were suddenly attacked by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. They immediately used a part of the people to cooperate with the famous Guo Haibo guerrilla team to launch a battle against Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and the others insisted on holding a meeting and completed the liquidation work. They created a method of fighting guerrillas on one side and settling accounts in the sorghum fields on the other side; fighting guerrillas during the day and settling accounts at night; taking turns to perform war duties and taking turns to settle accounts; men participating in the war and women settling accounts, and so on. The peasants in Dongtanshan Village, Zanhuang County, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, were guarded by the emancipation team and the militia at night, while carrying out land reform. The masses in a certain urban area of Gaomi County, Shandong, first moved their old, young, and family members to the homes of relatives and friends in the rear, and they carried out liquidation struggles in the midst of artillery fire. In areas temporarily occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops or in guerrilla areas, they organized armed work teams or emancipation groups to advance forward, destroy Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organizations and reactionary regimes, establish democratic regimes, arrest the most heinous traitors and bullies, and recover the fruits they had seized from the masses and distribute them to the masses, and then carry out land reform, and appropriately take care of the landlords. In the central area, they used all their strength to carry out land reform, and adopted a system of rotation for the supply of porters. For example, Shandong adopted a standing system for porters to ensure that a large part of the peasants stayed at home and could concentrate on their emancipation work. All these experiences are very good and can be referred to and promoted everywhere.

In the past six months, the land reform movement in various liberated areas has been uneven. Some areas have almost been completed, some areas have just started, and some areas seem to be "basically completed" at first glance, but after careful inspection, the peasants are still "empty-handed" or "half-emancipated." The creation of this situation is due, on the one hand, to some different objective situations in various places, but the main decision depends on whether the leading organs and responsible cadres in various places earnestly implement the land policy of "land to the tiller," and whether they adopt the mass line in implementing this policy. In order to quickly smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and enable our army to switch to the counter-offensive earlier, and in order to establish the foundation for democratic construction in the liberated areas, we must resolutely implement land reform. In places where work has just begun, in particular, we should concentrate a large number of cadres and do our best to do it. In places where there have already been achievements, do not be complacent, but conduct in-depth and practical inspections, eliminate blank villages and the phenomenon of clear division but dark non-division, and strive to basically complete the arduous task of land reform in the liberated areas before spring plowing, and on this basis prepare for the large-scale production movement next spring.

　　争取春耕前完成土地改革
    解放日报十四日社论
    半年以来，解放区普遍地轰轰烈烈地进行了实现“耕者有其田”的土地改革运动，这是一件有空前伟大历史意义的大事。土地改革是我国反帝反封建的民主革命的最主要的内容，真正实行了“耕者有其田”，将占全国人口百分之八十以上的农民从外国帝国主义与本国封建势力的血腥剥削中解放出来，将土地从封建剥削者手中转回到农民的手里，变为农民的私有财产，这样便能“使农业从落后的水平进到近代化的水平，从而使工业获得市场，造成了将农业国转变为工业国的可能性”（毛泽东）。解放区实行土地改革的经验，完全证明只要当土地“回了老家”，农民取得了“命根子”、“饭碗根”，农民的生产积极性便空前的提高了，生产量就大大提高，有的地方已做到耕三余一，个别的甚至做到耕一余三。农村赤贫消灭，乞丐偷盗绝迹，雇贫农大批升为中农、富农，市场欣欣向荣，小工业蓬勃发展。解放区的这种兴旺气象，正是独立民主富强的新中国的指标。
    在今天的解放区贯彻土地改革，同时又是粉碎蒋军进攻，争取全面抵抗胜利主要关键。五个多月来自卫战的经验，证明了那里的土地改革做的好，那里的群众参加爱国自卫战争便越加坚决，胜仗也打的越多。如苏皖农民翻身以后，参战情绪十分高涨，泰兴新街区五千余户雇农、贫农，平均每户得地三亩余，接着便有九百四十人自动参军，另有八百人涌入民兵。在泰兴北宣家堡战斗中，参加担架运输的农民就有一万二千人，几乎全部壮丁都参战。晋冀鲁豫有一千余万农民获得土地，民兵发展到二百多万，成千成万的翻身农民涌入主力军，各县成立了翻身营、翻身团，作为有力的地方武装参加战斗。正如刘伯承将军所说：“我军胜利的主要因素，在于我军士气旺盛，这是因为我们正义自卫的战争。士兵都是翻了身的农民，他们为保卫自己的翻身果实而战斗，因此在战斗中莫不奋勇向前，以一当十”！
    再以冀东为例，该区在自卫战争中游击战打得很好，其原因也在于彻底进行了土地改革。该区二十四县中，有三百万人得到了土地，群众参军非常踊跃，民兵的作战三个月来每个分区至少一千五百次。遵化一县的民兵，一个月作战一百十二次，毙伤俘敌八十八人，尤其是掩护群众转移，监视特务分子，防止投敌，作用极大，至今遵化敌人只能困守孤城，乡村中投敌的没有几个。
    半年来的经验证明了有一种观念是不正确的，那种观念认为在自卫战争中，不可能同时进行土地改革运动；要进行自卫战，便不能不放松土地改革，自卫战与土地改革是两个阶段的工作等。事实究竟怎样呢？事实正表现出自卫战急切的要求旺盛的革命精力，而土地改革恰恰是提供这种精力的源泉。山西沁源县中心区，原先动员民夫很困难，后来实行了土地改革，农民都分到了地，他们便都自动踊跃参加。连原来领到的工钱，也要退回给公家，这就是一个很好的证据。另一面，自卫战在一定程度上，又能进一步鼓舞农民翻身与保护土地改革。那里的土地改革与自卫战结合得越好，那里的土地改革与自卫战便越有成绩。苏皖、晋冀鲁豫、山东和冀东的农民，在这方面有很多新创造，他们在边沿区实行一手拿枪，一手分田，同时坚持游击战争与土地改革的方针。如苏中南通某乡农民，手执武器坚决打击下乡抢掠的“还乡团”，同时掀起了十三夜的清算运动，全部农民得到了土地。苏中一分区某县农民开会清算恶霸土地时，突遭蒋军袭击，他们即以一部分人配合有名的郭海波游击队，对蒋军展开战斗，另外的人仍坚持开会，完成了清算的工作。他们创造了一面打游击，一面在高粱地里算账；白天打游击，夜里算账，轮流担任战争勤务，轮流算账；男人参战，女人算账等等办法。晋冀鲁豫赞皇县东坛山村的农民，入夜由翻身队和民兵担任警戒，同时展开土地改革。山东高密县某城区的群众，先把老小家属搬往后方的亲友家里，自己则在炮声隆隆中进行清算斗争。在暂被蒋军侵占的地区或游击区，他们就组织武工队或翻身团向前挺进，摧毁蒋方特务组织、反动政权，建立起民主政权，逮捕罪大恶极的奸霸，追还其从群众手中夺去的果实分给群众，然后进行土地改革，并适当照顾地主。他们在中心区则用全力进行土地改革，对供应民夫采取轮流担任的制度。例如在山东采取民夫常备制，保证经常有大部分农民留在家中可以安心进行翻身工作。所有这些经验都是很好的，各地都可以参考推行。
    大半年来，各个解放区的土地改革运动是不平衡的，有的地区已接近完成，有的地区还开首不久，还有的粗看是“基本上完成”了，但过细检查，农民还是“翻了个空身”，或者“翻了半个身”。这种情况之造成，一方面因为各地方存在着一些不同的客观情况，而主要的决定于各地领导机关与负责干部的是否认真执行“耕者有其田”的土地政策，以及在执行这个政策中是否采取群众路线。为了迅速粉碎蒋介石的进攻，并使我军更早的转入反攻，为了确立解放区民主建设的基础，我们必须坚决地贯彻土地改革。在工作方才开始的地方，尤其应该尽可能集中大批干部，用全力去做。在已经有成绩的地方，切勿自满，要深入切实的检查，消灭空白村和明分暗不分的现象，务求做到在春耕以前基本上完成解放区土地改革的艰巨任务，并在这个基础上准备来春的大生产运动。
