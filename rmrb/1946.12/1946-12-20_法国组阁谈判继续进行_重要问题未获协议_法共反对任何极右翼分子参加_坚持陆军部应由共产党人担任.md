　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 17th: Paris - French political parties' cabinet negotiations had not reached an agreement as of the morning of the 16th. On the morning of the 15th, interim Prime Minister Blum met twice with Communist leaders Thorez and Duclos. Upon leaving Blum's office, Thorez told the swarm of reporters, "Everything is fine, negotiations are still ongoing." Subsequently, representatives from the Popular Republican Movement and the "Left Group" (which is essentially a right-wing group) met with Blum successively. According to a United Press reporter, the parties have reached an agreement in principle, but disagreements remain on two major issues in the Political Consultative Conference (whether to significantly reduce government spending and policy towards Vietnam) and the allocation of seats. It is understood that the French Communist Party insists on opposing any far-right participation and insists that the Ministry of the Army should be held by a Communist. According to a Reuters reporter, if the parties fail to reach an agreement by the 16th, Blum may form a temporary Socialist one-party cabinet to tide over the next four or five weeks until the official election of the president and the formation of a permanent government in January next year. According to the National Assembly's regulations, the list of the new cabinet should be submitted to the parliament for approval on the 17th, and the 16th is the last day of negotiations.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 15th: Paris - A French Communist Party spokesperson, commenting on Blum's election as prime minister, said: "We do not want to reject anyone, but we must know where he will lead our country!" Blum's election was due to the support of the French Communist Party, receiving 575 votes out of 590. It is reported that Blum's health has been poor recently, but he can still勉力support [can still strive to support] until the permanent government is formed in January next year.
　　[Also reported] The French National Assembly passed the list of 50 seats to be submitted to the Senate on the 13th as follows: Communist Party 12 seats, Socialist Party 7 seats, Social Democratic Resistance League 2 seats, Radical Party 3 seats, non-party affiliated 2 seats (above belong to the left wing), Popular Republican Movement 12 seats, Republican Liberty Party 3 seats, Independent Muslim Alliance 1 seat (above belong to the right wing). In addition, there are three seats for French people living in Morocco, two seats for French people living in Tunisia, and three seats for French people living in other overseas locations.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 12th: The French Senate re-election was held on the 8th. The 89,000 electors elected on the 24th of last month gathered in Paris and capitals overseas on that day to vote for the re-election of 265 of the 315 senators. The other 50 are nominated by the National Assembly (i.e., the House of Representatives). As a result of the election of electors last month, the Communist Party of France and Corsica had 24,788 people, and the Popular Republican Movement had 24,755 people.
