　　Land-Reformed Peasants' Patriotic and Self-Defense Enthusiasm Soars
    Military Region's New Recruit Regiment Intensifies Training
  　Deputy Commander Teng Gives Special Encouragement, Praise, and Calls on All New Recruit Regiments to Strive to Learn
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 2nd Dispatch] The continuous encouragement from the victories of self-defense on the front lines has further heightened the spirit of intense study among the soldiers of the new recruit regiments. On November 25th, Regiment Commander Ren of the Military Region's New Recruit Supplement × Regiment said in his report to the Military Region leaders: Eighty percent of this regiment are land-reformed peasants who voluntarily joined the army after the implementation of "land to the tiller." Therefore, from the first day they joined the new recruit regiment, everyone devoted their full enthusiasm to intense study and training. The thousands of new soldiers uniformly expressed only one hope: to complete their studies as soon as possible and go to the front lines to kill the enemy. After listening to these reports, Deputy Commander Teng Daiyuan of the Military Region, in addition to giving encouragement and praise to the officers and soldiers of the regiment and giving specific instructions for their work, also called on the commanders and fighters of all new recruit regiments in the Military Region to intensify their military training and complete all studies in the shortest possible time to meet the glorious battles. In their studies, each new soldier must master the three major techniques of shooting, bayonet fighting, and grenade throwing, learn night combat, and develop the strengths of our army's close combat, oppose formalism, reduce standardized drills, and strive to adapt everything to combat. In political training, every new soldier must understand the nature of the People's Army, promote new heroism, and fight to defend their hometowns and consolidate their land-reformed interests.
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 29th Dispatch] The × Regiment of the 7th Sub-district of Southern Hebei utilized the intervals between battles to obstruct and trap enemy and puppet forces to conduct large-scale military training. A representative meeting of learning from a company was recently held to summarize experiences. More than 30 representatives of learning in bayonet fighting, grenade throwing, and other areas attended. Zhao Haiyou, a learning representative from the 6th Company, excitedly introduced his class's experience in practicing bayonet fighting. He said: "When we first started training, we could only thrust more than 50 times. Later, when I heard that someone in the 5th Company could thrust 2,000 times, I tried my best, and as a result, I thrust more than 1,000 times. My confidence increased, and I felt that if I continued to train hard, I would definitely be able to thrust even more. Later, my shoulders ached from training, but I resolutely continued to train until I passed the pain stage. Now I have thrust 13,600 times." Talking about his experience in leading all the comrades in his class in military training, he said that he must take the lead in everything and talk to everyone individually to encourage their confidence. Under Zhao Haiyou's leadership, now everyone in the class, except for two sick people, can thrust more than 10,000 times. (Ze Ran)
