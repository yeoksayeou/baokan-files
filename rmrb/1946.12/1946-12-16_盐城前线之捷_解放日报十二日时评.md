　　Victory on the Yancheng Front
    *Liberation Daily* Commentary on the 12th

    From November 26th to December 9th, the New Fourth Army fiercely attacked the invading Chiang troops on the Yancheng front, killing and wounding more than 3,000 and capturing over 2,000 alive. This is the eleventh major victory of General Su Yu's troops in the past five months. These eleven major victories have eliminated a total of 90,000 Chiang troops. The glorious self-defense achievements of the military and civilians of Jiangsu and Anhui most vividly demonstrate the inevitable defeat of the Chiang army.

    Among all the liberated areas, the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated area is closest to Nanjing, the capital of the Chiang government. The superior achievements of democratic construction and people's well-being in the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated area stand in stark contrast to the autocratic corruption and people's misery under the rule of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Therefore, the achievements of the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated area are particularly well-known and envied by millions of working people, national capitalists, and all patriots within the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Precisely because of this, Chiang Kai-shek is particularly afraid and resentful of it. At the beginning of launching the all-out civil war, he had to concentrate a large force to attack it. Before the heroic resistance of the military and civilians of Jiangsu and Anhui, he repeatedly lost troops and generals, but still pieced together his forces and launched repeated frantic attacks. Thus, the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated area became the forefront and one of the most important fronts of the entire self-defense war.

    As long as people recall the boasts of the warmongers not long ago, the great significance of the ten consecutive victories won by the military and civilians of Jiangsu and Anhui becomes even more evident. In early July, wasn't Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of National Defense Chen Cheng boasting that the People's Liberation Army in northern Jiangsu could be "resolved" in two weeks? But twenty-three weeks have passed, and it is not the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu that has been wiped out, but precisely 90,000 of Chiang's troops. At the beginning of the all-out civil war, when the military and civilians of the entire liberated area had not yet been fully mobilized and had not yet escaped passivity, the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated area was already able to inflict annihilating blows on the enemy. Today, as far as the overall war situation is concerned, the military and civilians of the liberated area have begun to turn to the initiative. Then, in the future, the military and civilians of the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated area will have even better conditions to annihilate the enemy and cooperate with various fronts to gradually launch a counter-offensive and recover lost territory. This can be predicted. The Jiangsu-Anhui battlefield is a place where Chiang's troops are concentrated in greater numbers and supplies are relatively convenient. However, even on this battlefield, Chiang Kai-shek still cannot complete his strategic intentions despite paying a heavy price. Chiang Kai-shek's defeat is already certain and beyond doubt!

    From the Battle of Yancheng, it can be seen that the combat effectiveness of our army has been further improved. After suffering disastrous defeats on the LianShui front and the Baojia River bank, the Chiang army妄想 to pull a "lose in the east, make up in the west" trick, and in the southern line gathered two brigades of the 83rd Division, two brigades of the 66th Division, and one brigade of the 25th Division, a total of eleven regiments, under the cover of aircraft, attacked Yancheng from four routes: Dongtai, Xinghua, Linze, and ×zhen, attempting to cut off the connection between the Suzhong and Su-Wan liberated areas of the fifth and sixth districts, so as to close the door on Suzhong and carry out a mop-up operation, and at the same time cooperate with the Yunhe northern section forces to "resolve" the main force of the New Fourth Army. However, this wishful thinking was quickly seen through by the heroic and good-fighting New Fourth Army, who set up a net on the FanGong embankment leading to Yancheng and invited them into the urn. Sure enough, as expected, the Chiang troops, who began to invade from the 26th of last month, were met head-on by the New Fourth Army as soon as they entered the Kacang Wuyou area south of Yancheng. In less than fifteen days, the Chiang troops were killed, wounded, and captured more than 5,000 people, and the defeated troops retreated in a panic to the Dongtai area.

    We extend our highest respect to the heroic military and civilians of Jiangsu and Anhui. After establishing battle merits in eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, you have also undergone the test of the patriotic self-defense war. Especially in the cruel war of the past five months, you have continuously achieved victories and tempered yourselves to be stronger.

    The current self-defense war is a war of decisive significance for the future of the Chinese people, and the military and civilians of Jiangsu and Anhui are standing on the front line of this war. Today, every achievement of the military and civilians of Jiangsu and Anhui is watched by compatriots across the country and people of the world, and will be recorded in the most important page of Chinese history, forever immortal.

    Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis has arrived. In order to save this crisis, Chiang Kai-shek will continue to struggle desperately and launch another frenzied attack on the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated area. We believe that the ever-victorious New Fourth Army and the people of Jiangsu and Anhui will certainly continue to work hard, unite as one, and, as in the past, smash the invaders and finally achieve the goal of restoring all lost territory.

　　盐城前线之捷
    解放日报十二日时评
    自上月廿六日至本月九日，新四军在盐城前线痛击进犯蒋军，毙伤其三千余人，生俘二千余人，这是五个月来粟裕将军所部的第十一次大胜仗。这十一次大胜仗歼灭的蒋军足足有九万人，苏皖军民的光辉自卫战绩，最生动地证明了蒋军的必败。
    在各解放区中，苏皖解放区离蒋政府的首都南京最近。苏皖解放区民主建设、民生幸福的优越建树和蒋管区统治的专制腐败、民不聊生的黑暗情况的对照，特别明显。因此，苏皖解放区的业绩，特别为蒋管区内千百万劳动人民和民族资本家及一切爱国人士所熟知和羡慕。也正因为如此，蒋介石特别惧怕和痛恨它。他在发动全面内战之始，就不得不集中很大的兵力来进攻它，他在苏皖军民英勇抵抗之前，屡次损兵折将，但仍然拚凑兵力，再三向它疯狂进攻，于是苏皖解放区就成为整个自卫战争的最前线和最重要前线之一。
    只要人们回忆一下不久以前好战派的大言，就越发可以看出苏皖军民连获十一次大捷的伟大意义。在七月初，蒋介石的国防部长陈诚不是吹过两个星期就可以解决苏北的人民解放军吗？但是二十三个星期过去了，被消灭的不是苏北新四军而恰恰是蒋军的九万有生力量。在全面内战初期，整个解放区军民尚未充分动员，尚未摆脱被动的时候，苏皖解放区就已经能给敌人以歼灭性的打击，今天就整个战局而言，解放区军民已开始转入主动，那末今后苏皖解放区军民就将有更好的条件来歼灭敌人，并配合各战线逐步进行反攻，收复失地，这是可以预言的。苏皖战场是蒋军兵力集中较多，供应比较方便的地方，然而就在这个战场上蒋介石虽然付了重大代价，仍无法完成其战略意图。蒋介石的败局已定，是无可置疑的了！
    从盐城之役，可以看出我军的战斗力更加提高了。蒋军在涟水前线和包家河岸遭受惨败后，妄想来一个“失之东隅收之桑榆”的把戏，在南线集结了八十三师的两个旅、六十六师的两个旅、和二十五师的一旅共十一个团的兵力，在飞机掩护下，由东台、兴化、临泽、×镇四路进攻盐城，企图借此切断苏中与苏皖解放区五六分区的联系，以便一面对苏中关起门来，实行清剿，另一面配合运河北段兵力“解决”新四军主力。可是这一如意算盘早被英勇善战的新四军识破，他们就在通往盐城的范公堤上张好罗网请其入瓮。果然不出所料，从上月二十六日开始进犯的蒋军，一进到盐城以南的卡仓伍佑地区，即遭新四军健儿的迎头痛击，不到十五天，蒋军就被毙伤俘五千余人，败军狼狈退至东台一带。
    我们仅向苏皖英勇军民致崇高敬意，你们在八年艰苦抗战建立战勋之后，又经过了爱国自卫战争的考验，特别在五个月来的残酷战争中，你们不断获得胜利，把自己锻炼得更坚强了。
    目前的自卫战争是对中国人民前途有决定意义的战争，而苏皖军民是站在这个战争的最前线上，今天苏皖军民的每一业迹，为全国同胞和全世界士民所瞩目，并将载入中国历史上最重要的一页，永垂不朽。
    蒋介石的军事危机已经到来了，为了挽救这个危机，蒋介石还将拚命挣扎，对苏皖解放区，再次疯狂进攻，我们相信常胜的新四军和苏皖人民一定能继续努力团结一致，像过去一样，粉碎进犯者，并最后达到恢复一切失地之目的。
