Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 10th: According to the "Yenching News" in Peiping on the 25th, when the US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, arrived in Peiping recently, five academic organizations of Yenching University, namely the North Star Society, the Free Forum Society, the Yenching Digest Society, the Yenching Life Society, and the Spark Society, sent a letter to Stuart requesting the United States to stop interfering in China's internal affairs. The letter began by stating that "the raging civil war and difficult living conditions have made it impossible for students to concentrate on their studies," and continued, "The reason why the civil war cannot be stopped is partly because the warmongers in China stubbornly refuse to give the people peace, and also because the United States has transferred more than four billion US dollars worth of 'surplus materials' to the Chinese government, fueling the Chinese civil war. Therefore, in the future, although we still welcome people from other countries to mediate fairly, we firmly demand that all foreign military and economic forces in China that hinder China's development withdraw. If they do not leave, they will become enemies of the Chinese people." Finally, the letter said: "As Stuart said, 'Chinese students need a new May Fourth Movement.' The anti-civil war movements in Kunming, Chengdu, and Shanghai over the past year are a continuation of the spirit of the May Fourth Movement. We demand the basic conditions for freedom of speech and a peaceful environment. We will resolutely oppose the civil war and strive to build an independent, free, and happy New China to the end."

    美应停止干涉我内政
    燕大五学术团体致函司徒雷登
    【新华社延安十日电】据北平“燕京新闻”二十五日称：当美驻华大使司徒于日前抵平时，燕京大学北极星社、自由论坛社、燕京文摘社、燕京生活社及星火社等五学术团体，曾致函司徒要求美国停止干涉中国内政。该函首述“内战炽烈与生活困难已使学生无法安心读书”，继称：“内战所以不能停止，一方面是由于中国的好战派坚不愿给人民以和平，同时由于美国以超过四十亿美元的‘剩余物资’转让给中国政府，助长中国内战。因此，在今后我们虽仍欢迎他国人能作公平调停，但对一切外国在中国的军事的经济的阻碍中国发展的势力，我们坚决的要他们退出去，他们不走就会变成中国人民的敌人”。末了该函说：诚如司徒所说：“中国学生需要一个新的五四运动”。一年来昆明、成都、上海的反内战运动，就是继续五四运动的精神。“我们要求给我们言论自由起码的生存条件，我们需要一个和平的环境。并在坚决反对内战中，为建立一个独立、自由、幸福的新中国而奋斗到底”。
