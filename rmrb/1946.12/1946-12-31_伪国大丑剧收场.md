Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 28th: The Kuomintang's illegal convocation of a one-party "National Assembly" concluded on December 25th. The meeting was postponed three times, lasting a total of forty-one days. The entire content of the forty-one-day meeting was a farce of "constitutionalizing and creating a constitution" personally led by Chiang Kai-shek and his party members and other servants. Chiang Kai-shek submitted the so-called "Draft Constitution of the Republic of China" formulated by the Kuomintang's one-party government to the assembly for "three readings" and passed it, and decided that January 1st of the following year would be the date of promulgation of the "Constitution" and December 25th would be the date of implementation. Even Wu Jingxiong, a Kuomintang legislator who participated in this performance of Chiang Kai-shek's "constitutional draft," could not deny that many important provisions in it "are actually the same old soup with new medicine" as the "May 5th Constitution Draft," and are "based on the presidential system (i.e., personal dictatorship)." However, Chiang Kai-shek still said that this was not completely in line with his "ideal" of the "Five-Power Constitution," and he reserved the right to fully realize this "ideal" in the future (i.e., after dreaming of "crushing the Communist Party in five months") (i.e., to realize a more "totalitarian" "totalitarian politics"). At the meeting, Chiang Kai-shek deliberately instigated his loyal party members to be "dissatisfied" with this "constitutional draft" and demanded more open dictatorship, and then personally came forward and led the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party "representatives" to oppose it on the grounds of maintaining the original "constitutional draft," pretending to be "democratic" and expressing "tolerance" to the "minority" (i.e., his servants the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party), making the "constitutional draft" appear to be some kind of "democratic constitution."

More than 1,600 "representatives" who participated in the "National Assembly," 85 percent were Kuomintang members (according to the British Royal Institute of International Affairs magazine "Today's World"), of which 900 were old "representatives" of the infamous "elections" ten years ago, the others were "representatives" "selected" by the Kuomintang government, and the others were "two small parties attached to the Kuomintang" (that is, the Youth Party that sold themselves) and the Socialist Party and a few fallen so-called "social elites"; these people were the supporting roles in this play. Among the "representatives" were openly well-known major traitors Wu Kaixian, Zeng Qi, and Niu Jingting, corruption offenders Li Runshen, Zhang Legu, Du Xiusheng, and Qiu Youzhen who had been reported, and Liu Yeqiao, a thug from the Jiaochangkou incident, who had been dismissed from the "National Assembly Representative" by the Chongqing Municipal Council. However, despite the unified direction of Chiang Kai-shek, this play was full of ugly appearances. Factions within the Kuomintang fought for power and profit, and quarreled over the seats of the presidium. The "Fuxing" faction cursed "Chen's running dogs should be killed and cooked," while the CC clique retorted and cursed them for "farting." Shouting and "boo" sounds became a characteristic of almost every meeting, and sometimes even brawls occurred. Chiang Kai-shek was so angry that he slammed the table and cursed several times, but still could not calm the meeting, and even had to use armed police to maintain order. Even at the "solemn closing," "representatives" Ni Bi and others engaged in verbal altercations. Reuters described the situation on the day as: Chiang Kai-shek pressed the table hard with both hands, glared at Ni Bi, and threatened him to be responsible for the meeting rules.

Chiang Kai-shek's farce has been despised by the people of the whole country from the day it opened. The Chongqing Democratic Daily said: "This one-man show will be the ugliest and most evil chapter in the history of the Kuomintang." Whether to participate in the "National Assembly" or not was considered by public opinion as a test for any party or individual. Those who participated in the "National Assembly" were called "fallen," called falling into a brothel's fire pit. Even the Fourth Middle School in Beiping, which was considered by the authorities to be the most successful in party-oriented education, when answering the question "What are your thoughts on the National Assembly?", the students' answers were: "This is playing tricks," "No different from Cao Kun's piglet parliament," "What is the difference from the Wang Jingwei regime in the enemy era?"... The international perception is equally bad. The New York Times, which has always been a supporter of Chiang Kai-shek, said: "The National Assembly closed in a dark and disappointing atmosphere, because the National Assembly is only a disguised unity." The Republican newspaper the New York Herald Tribune said: "The National Assembly attempts to whitewash the Kuomintang's rule, but this kind of disguise will not help."

　　伪国大丑剧收场
    【新华社延安二十八日电】蒋介石非法召开的一党“国大”已于二十五日宣布闭幕。该会前后延期三次，共经四十一天；四十一天会的全部内容，就是蒋介石亲自领导其党徒及其他仆从们一幕“制宪创宪”丑剧。蒋氏将国民党一党政府制定的所谓“中华民国宪法草案”提交大会以“三读通过”了事，并决定明年一月一日为该“宪法”颁布日期，十二月二十五日为实行日期。蒋介石的“宪草”，甚至参加这一串演的国民党立法委员吴经熊，亦不能否认其中许多重要规定“其实与五五宪草是换汤不换药”，是“总统制（即个人独裁）为本”的东西。但蒋介石尚说这还不完全合于他“五权宪法”的“理想”，他预约将来（即梦想“五个月粉碎中共”以后），完全实现这个“理想”（即实现更“极权”的“极权政治”）。会议上蒋介石故意唆使他的忠实党徒“不满意”这个“宪草”，要求更公开的独裁，然后又亲自出面并率领青年党、民社党“代表”，在维持原“宪草”的立场上，对此加以预定的反对，以假装“民主”，并表示“对少数”（即对其仆从青年党民社党）的“容忍”精神，使该“宪草”显得似乎是一部什么“民主宪法”。
    参加“国大”的一千六百多个“代表”，百分之八十五是国民党员（据英国皇家国际问题学会杂志《今日世界》载），其中九百个是声名狼籍的十年前“选举”的旧“代表”，其他是国民党政府“遴选”的“代表”，另外就是“附庸于国民党的两个小党派”（即卖身投靠的青年党）和社会党及几名落水的所谓“社会贤达”；这些人就是这幕戏的配角。“代表”中有公开知名的大汉奸吴开先、曾琦、牛敬亭，已经人检举的贪污犯李润绅、张乐古、杜修声、邱有珍，已被渝市参议会罢免“国代”资格的较场口打手刘野樵之类人物。但是，这幕戏尽管在蒋介石的统一导演下，仍然是丑态百出。国民党内派别争权夺利，为主席团的席位大吵大闹，“复兴”骂“陈家的走狗该杀该烹”，而ＣＣ则反唇相讥，骂他们“放屁”。叫骂和“嘘嘘”声几成每会必具的特点，有时甚至发生扭殴。蒋介石气得数次出面拍桌子大骂，仍不能使会场平静，以至要武装警察维持秩序。即在“庄严闭幕”时，“代表”倪弼等又演成口角。路透社描写当日情形称：蒋介石两手用力按着桌子，眼睛瞪着倪弼，并威胁倪，要他对会场规则负责任。
    蒋介石这幕丑剧，从开幕一天起就遭到全国人民的鄙弃。重庆民主报称：“这幕独脚戏将是国民党最丑最恶的一幕历史。”参加“国大”与否，被舆论界认为是任何党派及个人的考试。参加“国大的，就被人民叫做“落水”，叫做堕入妓院的火坑。就连被当局认为是党化教育最成功的北平第四中学，在其回答“你对国大有何感想的测验时，学生们的答案却是：“这是耍把戏”、“与曹锟的猪仔国会无异”、“与敌人时代汪记政权有何不同？”………在国际上的观感是同样糟糕。一向为蒋介石捧场的纽约时报说：“国大在阴暗而失望的空气中闭幕，盖国大仅为一伪装之团结也。”共和党的报纸纽约先锋论坛报说：“国大企图为保持国民党的统治粉饰，此种伪装将无济于事。”
