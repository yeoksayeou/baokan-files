　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 25th: Last month, on the 22nd, the United General Association for National Construction and Hometown Salvation of Overseas Chinese in Siam and 70 other organizations jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, expressing their opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's one-party "National Assembly" and their determination to support the CCP's proposals to adhere to peace and unity and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Chairman Mao sent a special reply of encouragement. The original telegram is as follows:

　　To the United General Association for National Construction and Hometown Salvation of Overseas Chinese in Siam, the Siam Federation of Trade Unions, the Siam Overseas Chinese Youth Association, the Siam Overseas Chinese Education Association, the Siam Qiongya Fellow-Villagers Association, and 66 other organizations; and please forward to all overseas Chinese in Siam:

　　Your telegram of November 22nd has been received. Your words are righteous and deeply admired. The Kuomintang authorities first rejected the suggestion to suspend the illegal National Assembly and then rejected the demand to dissolve the illegal National Assembly. This is tantamount to closing the door to negotiations. The people of the entire nation will never recognize this illegal, divisive, one-party National Assembly and the so-called constitution it has passed. From now on, our party is determined to fight to the end to restore the CPPCC line and to restore the military positions of January 13th. We hope that overseas compatriots will work together to realize the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland.

　　Mao Zedong, Hai, Yang.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 25th: Nanjing dispatch: Overseas Chinese in Siam are deeply dissatisfied with the Kuomintang's convening of a one-party National Assembly, which has caused division within the country. On November 22nd, 71 mass organizations, including the United General Association for National Construction and Hometown Salvation of Overseas Chinese in Siam, the Siam Federation of Trade Unions, the Siam Overseas Chinese Youth Association, the Siam Overseas Chinese Education Association, and the Qiongya Fellow-Villagers Association in Siam, representing 80,000 organized overseas Chinese, jointly sent a circular telegram to Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, Communist Party leader Mao Zedong, Democratic League leader Zhang Lan, and compatriots across the country, stating their views on the National Assembly issue.

　　The telegram to Chiang Kai-shek stated: "The government has actually sold out sovereignty, flattered foreign countries, and plunged our country into a semi-colonial state. Now it is forcibly violating public opinion, monopolizing the 'National Assembly,' and is determined to wage civil war, leading to the tragic disaster of national division. This is not only resolutely opposed by our overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam, but also completely violates the Three People's Principles and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of 'peaceful struggle to save China.'" The telegram demanded that Chiang Kai-shek immediately suspend the illegal "National Assembly," stop the civil war, and make a fresh start with the people. It also stated: "If the government disregards public opinion and continues to hold the 'National Assembly' and accelerate the civil war, then we (including 71 units, representing 80,000 organized overseas Chinese) will never recognize any resolutions of the one-party 'National Assembly' and will be united with our compatriots at home to fight to the end for genuine peace and democracy!"

　　The telegram to Chairman Mao and Mr. Zhang Lan stated: "Our overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam resolutely oppose this disastrous one-party 'National Assembly' and fully support your proposals to adhere to peace and unity and implement the resolutions of the CPPCC, and will strive unremittingly to achieve a new China of peace, independence, democracy, and unity!"

　　The telegram to compatriots across the country and various organizations and associations called on the people of the entire nation to rise up and fight together against the Kuomintang's one-party "National Assembly" and its policies of national betrayal, dictatorship, division, and civil war.

    【新华社延安二十五日电】上月二十二日暹罗华侨建国救乡联合总会等七十一团体曾联名致电中共中央主席毛泽东，表示反对蒋记一党“国大”，决心拥护中共坚持和平团结，实行政协决议的主张，毛主席特复电共勉，原电如下：
    暹罗华侨建国救乡联合总会、暹罗职工总会、暹罗华侨青年会、暹罗华侨教育协会、暹罗琼崖同乡会等七十一团体，并请转全暹华侨公鉴：
    十一月二十二日电悉，义正词严，至深钦佩。国民党当局既拒停开非法国大之建议于先，又拒解散非法国大之要求于后，实为自闭谈判之门，全国人民对该非法的分裂的一党国大与其所通过之所谓宪法决不承认。今后本党决为恢复政协路线与恢复一月十三日军事位置而奋斗到底，尚望海外同胞一致努力，以实现祖国之独立和平民主。
    毛泽东，亥、养。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】南京航讯：暹侨对于国民党召开一党国大造成国内分裂深感不满，十一月二十二日，包括八万有组织的华侨的暹罗华侨建国救乡联合总会、暹罗职工总会、暹罗华侨青年会、暹罗华侨教育协会、旅暹琼崖同乡会等七十一个群众团体，联名向国民党领袖蒋介石、共产党领袖毛泽东、民主同盟领袖张澜及全国同胞发出通电，申述对国大问题意见。
    致蒋介石之电文称：“政府竟出卖主权，献媚外国，陷我国于半殖民地。兹又强奸民意，包办‘国大’，决心内战，招致全国分裂之惨祸，此不仅我旅暹侨胞所坚决反对，抑且完全违背三民主义及国父‘和平奋斗救中国’之遗训。”电文要求蒋介石立即停开违法“国大”，停止内战与民更始。并称：“若政府不顾民情舆论，继续举行‘国大’，加速内战，则吾人（包括七十一个单位、代表八万有组织的侨胞）决不承认一党‘国大’之任何决议，誓必与国内同胞团结一致，为真正之和平民主奋斗到底！”
    致毛主席及张澜先生电文称：“我旅暹侨胞决然反对此祸国殃民之一党‘国大’，而全力拥护先生等坚持和平团结实行政协决议之主张，为争取实现和平独立民主统一之新中国而奋斗不懈！”
    致全国同胞暨各机关社团电中，呼吁全国人民为反对国民党一党“国大”及其卖国独裁分裂内战的政策共起奋斗。
