Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th: The New Fourth Army in Central China has created a new method of combat review. In the LianShui campaign at the end of October, the New Fourth Army in Central China annihilated 7,000 invading Chiang Kai-shek troops. After the victory, a certain unit reviewed the battle of attacking Jiaoling and annihilating one battalion in November. The review began with a specific study by a certain unit on how to reduce unnecessary losses, breaking the old set of "running account" style review methods and launching a surge of research into learning tactics. For example, a squad leader of a certain company said: "A certain soldier in my squad bravely advanced during the attack and was unfortunately injured, which was unavoidable. However, after being injured, he shouted angrily. At night, sound is most likely to indicate a target, so the enemy fired two artillery shells and injured another comrade. This comrade could have been completely avoided." Another example is a soldier from the fourth squad of a certain company who said: "The company commander ordered us to advance in the direction of the sixth company. The squad leader accepted the task very resolutely, but he did not observe the direction clearly, nor did he make good use of the terrain, but just rushed forward bravely. As soon as he went out, he rushed into the enemy's firepower circle, and one soldier was injured by the enemy's grenade. This was completely avoidable." The deputy of the sixth squad of the same company said: "The company commander also ordered us to go to the direction of the sixth company. The squad leader at that time very mobile took us from the side, the enemy fired five grenades, and we did not have a single casualty." A soldier named Wang Guangdong from another unit said: "That night, we were about to reach the enemy's bunker when the enemy fired two shots. Our machine gunner was not calm and fired too early, firing two bursts of machine gun fire, which attracted two artillery shells in return." This method of review opened a new path for reviewing combat actions. So learning became exceptionally enthusiastic. Especially when it was summed up, after seeing that 70% of the few casualties in this battle could have been avoided, everyone agreed that research and learning were very important. All the soldiers of a certain unit held a special meeting to discuss twelve ways to deal with 60mm mortars. Under this enthusiastic wave of tactical review, the cadres at the company and platoon levels were also inspired, and they all reviewed their own consciousness of command. After the review, the morale of the entire unit was even higher and their confidence was stronger. Then, two field exercises were conducted, seriously and with interest. Everyone believes that this review is a movement for soldiers to educate themselves, which will improve the consciousness, initiative and creativity of cadres and soldiers in combat. (Xu Xin)

　　掀起研究学习战术热潮！
    华中新四军某部
    创造战斗检讨新方法
    从战士每一个切身有关的实际问题出发，检讨与改进思想和行动；采取群众路线的学习方法，不用注入与刻板的方式。
    【新华社华中十八日电】华中新四军创造战斗检讨新方法。十月底涟水战役，华中新四军歼灭进犯蒋军七千；于胜利结束后，某部于十一月间检讨攻击茭菱歼敌一营之战。检讨中首由某单位具体研究如何减少不必要的损失开始，打破旧的一套流水账式的检讨法，掀起研究学习战术热潮。如某连的班长发言说：“我班某战士在攻击时勇猛前进，不幸受了伤，这是不可避免的。但他受伤后愤怒的叫喊起来，在夜间声音最容易指示目标，于是敌人打来了两个炮弹，又伤了一位同志；这个同志是完全可以避免的。”又如某连四班一个战士说：“连长命令我们进到六连方向，班长接受任务是很坚决的，但他未观察清楚方向，没好好利用地形，只是勇敢猛冲，出门就冲入敌人火力圈内，有一个战士被敌人手榴弹打伤了。这是完全可以避免的。”该连六班副说：“连长也命令我们到六连方向，班长当时很机动的带着我们从侧面过去，敌人打了五个手榴弹，我们一个也没伤亡。”另一单位的战士王广东说：“当夜我们快摸到敌人碉堡附近，敌人打了两枪。我们机枪手不沉着，过早开火，开了两梭机枪，反引来两个炮弹。”这样检讨的方法，打开了战斗动作检讨的新门径。于是学习异常踊跃。特别在总结时，看出在这次战役很少的伤亡中有百分之七十是可以避免的之后，大家更一致认为研究与学习十分重要。某单位全体战士专门开了个会，讨论出了十二个办法来对付六零炮。在此热烈检讨战术热潮下，也启发了连排各级干部，他们纷纷检讨自己指挥的自觉性。检讨后，整个部队情绪更高，信心更强。接着做了两次实地演习，认真而有兴趣。大家都认为这次检讨是战士教育自己的运动，将会提高干部战士在作战中的自觉性、积极性和创造性。（徐忻）
