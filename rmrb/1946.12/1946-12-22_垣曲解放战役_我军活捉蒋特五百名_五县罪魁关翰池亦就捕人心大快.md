[This news is] transmitted from Taiyue on the 20th of this month by our newspaper: During the recent battle to liberate Yuanqu, we captured a total of 510 Chiang Kai-shek special agents from the "Reverse Calculation Team," the "Revenge Struggle Corps," and other groups. Following the established lenient policy of the democratic government, after educating the captured agents, except for the Chiang Kai-shek special agent leaders and traitorous despots, such as Guan Hanchi, Wang Peiju, and Bi Yuhua, numbering over 80, who are still in custody, the remaining 420-plus people were released in succession on the 7th. Guan Hanchi, currently 44 years old and from Guanjia Village, Yuanqu, is one of the important heads of Chiang Kai-shek’s special service in southern Shanxi. He studied at the Shanxi Educational Institute and later entered the Shanxi Military and Political Fast Training Class. He joined the Kuomintang in 1927 and successively served as a staff member of the Shanxi Provincial Party Department, a party affairs commissioner in the 19th District of Shanxi, and is currently a staff member of the Yuanqu branch of the Youth League, authorized as the head of Chiang Kai-shek’s special agents in the five counties of Jiangxian, Yicheng, Yuanqu, Quwo, and Wenxi. He participated in and masterminded the famous December coup in Shanxi, the Wufujian massacre in Yuanqu, and the massacre during the Chiang army’s invasion of Yuanqu. The public security organs are currently investigating a large number of important documents obtained. According to Guan Hanchi's own statement, the central task of the Youth League after its establishment in Yuanqu was: 1. Assist the military (referring to the Chiang army) and government (referring to the Chiang government) in suppressing lurking Communist Party members. 2. Develop a large number of league members. During the three months that the Chiang army invaded Yuanqu, they massacred over 200 farmers. Upon hearing the news of Guan's arrest, the people of southern Shanxi were overjoyed. With the Chiang Kai-shek special agents and their armed forces wiped out in one fell swoop by our public security organs, the Chiang army has lost its claws and ears for controlling the people. Now, the Chiang army is suffering blows everywhere from our local corps, guerrillas, and militia, and cannot gain a foothold.

　　垣曲解放战役
    我军活捉蒋特五百名
    五县罪魁关翰池亦就捕人心大快
    【本报太岳二十日电】上次解放垣曲战役时，捕获蒋特“倒算队”、“复仇奋斗团”等共计五百一十人，除罪大恶极之蒋特首领、汉奸恶霸分子关翰池、王培榘、毕裕华等八十余人仍在监押外，其余四百二十余人，民主政府本既定之宽大政策，经过教育于七日即陆续释放。按关翰池为晋南蒋记特务重要负责人之一，现年四十四岁，垣曲关家村人，肄业于山西教育学院，后入山西军政速成班，民国十六年即加入国民党，历任山西省党部干事，山西十九区党务专员，现任青年团垣曲分团干事，授为绛县、翼城、垣曲、曲沃、闻喜五县蒋特之负责人。山西著名之十二月政变，垣曲五福涧惨案，此次蒋军侵占垣曲之大屠杀，他都参与主谋，现正由公安机关研究获得之大批重要文件加以侦察中。据关翰池自称：青年团在垣曲成立后之中心工作，即是一、协助军（指蒋军）政（指蒋政府）剿灭潜伏之共党分子。二、大量发展团员。按蒋军在侵入垣曲之三个月中，屠杀之农民即达二百余人。晋南人民闻讯关已被捕，无不称快，此次蒋特及其武装，为我公安机关一举扑灭，蒋军即失去统治人民之爪牙与耳目，现蒋军处处遭受我地方兵团、游击队、民兵之打击，无法立足。
