　　Zhang Chengke, Model of Emancipation
    Liu Jiang
    I am fifty-six years old this year. Since I was nine years old, I have been herding sheep and working as a farmhand. It was not until the liberation of Heshun County last year, when I met the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, that I began to live like a human being. As far as I can remember, my grandfather was a farmhand, and my father and I continued to work for landlords for three generations, like donkeys without tails.

    If we talk about suffering, my family has been good at suffering for three or four generations. My grandmother and mother spent years making soles for shoes and twisting ropes under the moonlight at night and sewing soles during the day. Alas, even with all this hard work, we never became rich. One year, I herded sheep and gathered two dou of corn, hoping to have a good year for the whole family, but the landlord, like a "Yama who doesn't mind skinny ghosts," scraped it all away. In that society, we poor people were like scallions, with the landlord cutting off a piece whenever we grew a little. How could we possibly have a good life!

    During the famine in the twenty-ninth year, I was working for Zhao Sihai. My father ate bran for ten days and was forced to death! I kowtowed to the landlords Lü Ershu and Bi Linquan, begging them to help me buy a coffin for my father. After all, my parents had given birth to me and raised me with great effort. Even if I didn't eat or wear anything, I wouldn't shortchange them. But Bi Linquan glared at me and said, "What kind of brain do you have?" I knelt on the ground, but he never looked at me again. (At this point, Chengke was choked with sobs.) Later, the manager Zhao Sihai, remembering that I was his farmhand, gave me seven mao of wages to buy a mat and wrap my father! Including the six mao I had on me, it cost a total of one yuan and three mao to take care of the funeral. I was both the filial son and the coffin bearer, too busy crying to walk properly. Thinking about the past society and those landlord bastards, my heart aches!

    That year, I sharecropped land with Sun Yuanzhou in Qicun. After a whole year of hard work, I didn't get any grain and even had to contribute a dou of rice. Alas! There was no other way, so my wife had to wean our newborn child and become a wet nurse for someone else. That's how the whole family "picked up scraps," and we only "picked up scraps" of one jin of buckwheat to celebrate the new year for the whole family of five. Comrades, do you think that if this world doesn't change, the poor will have a chance to live?

    In the past, I didn't have a single tile over my head or a clod of earth under my feet (meaning I had no house or land). My father died without wearing a pair of shoes, I never wore socks, and the whole family never had a quilt. Last year, when the anti-Japanese government came back, they gave me six dou of relief grain, which was the first happy event in my life. Then I discussed it with my fellow poor lads (referring to hired laborers), and I said, "No one used to stand up for us, but what are we afraid of now? Let's unite and fight those bastards!" In less than two days, we launched a wage increase movement, and my fellow poor lads insisted on electing me as the vice chairman of the labor union. Hey, I couldn't be happier.

    We are people who are afraid of living in poverty. Last summer, the relief grain given to me, plus the wages I recovered, I didn't spend a penny of it. I bought three mu of land. In three generations, I'm acquiring property and buying land for the first time. In the winter, my wife earned some money as a wet nurse, and I borrowed some more and bought a donkey. Holding my own donkey reins, this is also the first time.

    Last winter, when the emancipation movement started, some of our farmhands were unwilling to participate, like Guan Yinshuo and Wang Minghui, about seven or eight of them. They said that after emancipation, they would only get two mu of land, which was not as worry-free as being a farmhand. Later, I slowly worked to get through to them, saying that we could never be worry-free while holding someone else's bowl. Li Fuxing on our street suffered for a landlord his whole life and ended up hanging himself, and Ma Shichang suffered his whole life and died in the San Guan Temple, eaten by wolves. If we don't struggle for emancipation, we can never expect to live a worry-free life. I took the time to chat with them, and now aren't they all activists?!

    This time, in the struggle against the local tyrant Bi Linquan, some people were still not very aware. I went to their homes one by one to chat with them, going for meals and at night, but I couldn't move everyone's hearts. I thought to myself that if everyone didn't rise up to fight, we wouldn't be able to defeat Bi Linquan, the "Lone Tiger." Later, I thought that the most heartbreaking things would move people's hearts the most. Once they were moved, everyone would definitely rise up and fight him. Having made up my mind, I went to mobilize them again. I asked those who had relatives who starved to death in the twenty-ninth year, "When did your mother die? Who forced your brother to death?" After such a pursuit and recollection, it all led back to the local tyrant Bi Linquan. Ha, at this time, it was like loading a ready-made cannon, and it ignited with a single spark. Bi Linquan was quickly defeated by us.

    A few days ago, the cooperative awarded me a pig. I said that our mutual aid team doesn't have a pig, so let's make it for everyone. The veterans get half, and our four households get half. As long as I fatten the pig, regardless of eating meat or sharing dividends, the masses will remember me.

    Last year, I was still working as a farmhand. Later, I united with my fellow poor lads and launched the emancipation movement. They were emancipated, and I wasn't left out either. Now I live in a brick house, have seventeen mu of good land, and my children have entered school. I cannot forget Chairman Mao and the Communist Party after being emancipated, so I must work hard in production. This year, when weeding, my group was full of children and old men. I pushed them to produce every day, finished weeding my own seedlings early, and earned more than one shi of rice in other groups. Everyone elected me as the brigade leader again and also published reports on the street. I am even happier. I get up to ring the bell every day without understanding why, and if they don't get up, I go to the street to mobilize them. This year, the crops there are all good, and I have also been promoted to a middle peasant.

    Why wouldn't I be happy and like this time? If the reactionaries come to attack the liberated areas, my whole family will come out! Landlords and spies spread rumors that "the world is going to change." If you ask me, Chiang Kai-shek is a crow turning into a pig, getting blacker and blacker. After three months of transformation, he lost 200,000 of his dog-day troops. If he transforms again, even his head will be transformed.

　　翻身模范张成科
    刘江
    我今年五十六岁，从九岁起就放羊住长工，自去年和顺县解放，我和共产党八路军会了面，才开头当了个人。从我记得事以来俺爷爷就是住长工，到俺爹和我手里，整整端人家地主的碗当了三辈没尾巴驴。
    要说受苦，俺家三四辈都是好受家，俺奶和俺妈长年是给人家纳底，黑夜月亮地搓绳，白天纳。唉，就这么受死受活再也没发了财。那年我放羊拾下二斗来玉茭，可打算全家过个好年，就这地主也“阎王不嫌鬼瘦”的给刮走了。过去那社会里，咱穷人真好比大葱，长一节地主切你一节，你怎么能够过得好日子呢！
    廿九年遭年馑那年，我正给赵四孩住的，俺爹吃了十天糠到了给逼死了！我给人家地主吕二树、毕林全都磕过头，我说你们帮我好歹给俺爹买个棺材，父母爹娘总算是开肠剥肚养了我一回的，我就是不吃不穿，受死受活也短不下你们的；嘿嗨，人家毕林全把眼一瞪，“你长的是什么脑袋”，我在地下跪，人家就再也没看我一眼。（谈到这里，成科哭不成声）后来掌柜赵四孩念起我是他的长工，才给支了七毛工钱买了一领席，把俺爹卷了！连上我身上的六毛钱，共花了块三钱打发了一顶丧。我是连当孝子带抬丧，顾了哭顾不了走。想起过去那社会和那些地主杂种们呀，我的心把都是疼哩！
    那年我在祁村和孙元周半种地，整整受了一年，没分下粮食，还贴了一斗米，唉！没办法，才让俺老婆把自己一生日的孩从奶头上摘下来，去给人家奶孩。就这么全家“拾砍”，赶年才“拾砍”了一斤荞面，全家五口人过了个大年。同志，你说这世道不变变，穷人还有一天活头？
    我从前是头上没顶一片瓦圪瘩，脚下没踩一块土圪垃（无房无地的意思），俺爹临死都没穿上一双鞋，我没有穿过袜，全家没盖过被，去年抗日政府一回来，一下就给我发了六斗救济粮，这是我一辈的头一桩喜事。跟着我就和俺们那伙穷小子（指雇工）商量了商量，我说过去没人给咱做主，现在这还怕啥，团结起来和狗日们干吧，不两天就展开增资运动，俺们那伙穷小子硬选我当了工会副主席。嘿，我该不是高兴哩。
    咱是过穷光景过怕的人，去年夏天发给我的救济粮，算回的工钱，我一个也没舍得花，买了三亩地。我三辈啦，置庄买地，我这是头一回。到冬天俺老婆赚回些奶孩工钱，我又挑借了些，买下个驴，捉自己的驴缰绳，这也是头一回。
    去年冬天闹开翻身运动，俺们那伙住长工的，有些就不愿意参加，像观音锁、王明会们，有这么七八长工，他们都说是翻了身闹上二亩地，还不如住长工息心。后来我就慢慢的去打通他们的思想，我说端人家的碗，多会也不能息心了。咱街上李福兴给地主受了一辈，临死落了个吊死鬼，马世昌受了一辈，死在三官庙里，落了个狼吃鬼；咱要不斗争翻身，永远不用想望过一天息心光景。我抽空就去和他们闲扯，现在这伙人那个不是积极分子？！
    这一次斗争恶霸毕林全，有些人还不很觉悟，我就一家一家的去和他们闲扯，吃饭也去，黑夜也去，怎也没有把大家的心说动。我思谋了一下，要是大家不起来斗，“一只虎”毕林全就是怕斗不倒。后来我想，最伤心事就最能动人心，一动心，大家一定起来和他干。拿定了主意，就又去向他们动员，我见了在二十九年饿死过自己亲人的就问他们：“你妈是那年死来呀，你哥哥是谁逼死来呀……”这么一追一回想，都追到恶霸毕林全头上了。哈，到这时候，真如同装现成的炮，一点就着，毕林全很快就让俺们打垮了。
    前两天合作社奖给我一口猪，我说俺这个互助组没猪，咱算成大伙的吧，荣退军人顶一半，俺四户顶一半，只要我把猪喂胖，不管吃肉分红，群众都会结记我哩。
    去年我还是给人家住长工的，赶到后来和俺那伙穷小子团结起来搞开了翻身运动，他们翻身了，我也没漏下，我现在住的是砖瓦房，有了十七亩好地，孩也进了学堂。我翻了身不能忘毛主席共产党，就得好好生产，今年锄苗时，我那组还尽是孩孩老汉，我每天拉拔他们生产，早早锄完自己的苗，还又在外组赚下一石多米。大家又把我选成大队长，还在街上出报。我越高兴啦，天天不明就起来打钟，他们起不来，我还去街头上动员他们。今年他那里的庄稼都好，我也升成中农了。
    你说这时光我为啥不高兴不喜欢？要是反动派来进攻解放区，我是全家出马！地主和特务造谣说是要“变天”，要让我说，蒋介石是老鸦变猪，越变越黑，变了三个月，就变掉了他狗日的二十万人马，再变变，连他的脑袋也要变掉哩。
