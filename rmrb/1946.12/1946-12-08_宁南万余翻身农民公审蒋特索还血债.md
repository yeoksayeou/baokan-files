　　[This article is from Weixian on the 6th] Ningnan, over ten thousand emancipated peasants publicly tried Chiang Kai-shek's special agents Tian Gongyao, Li Zemin, Wang Zangzhen, etc., to settle the blood debts for more than seventy lives. Li Zemin was a local tyrant and landlord. After the incident, he organized the "Lian Zhuang Hui" (a local militia) and committed all kinds of evil deeds, including murder and robbery. He once led bandits to attack Dongwang, using a铡刀 (a type of guillotine) to cut nine people to death and砍 (chop/hack) more than twenty people to death, killing a total of forty-five people. During the speak bitterness meetings, the old mother of Zhao Naishu from Dongwang Xizhen, led her widowed daughter-in-law and orphaned granddaughter, pointed at Li Zemin and said, "You chopped my son Zhao Naishu into three pieces, and you made my old man angry and died. What kind of hatred do I have with you?" Her widowed daughter-in-law beat Li Zemin while wailing loudly. The little granddaughter covered her eyes with both hands, sobbing incessantly. Finally, the old lady raised her hands and shouted, "You spies were all sent by Chiang Kai-shek; you little Chiang Kai-sheks kill people, and the big Chiang Kai-shek supports you, Chiang Kai-shek, give me back my son!" Tian Gongyao was a local big bully, who had been carrying out special agent activities such as spreading rumors, sabotage, disintegration, and assassination in the villages near Dongwang for many years. He was responsible for the deaths of nine people, and he single-handedly created the Nandincao massacre, killing seven people including the director of the Farmers' Association, Hou Fuqing. Fuqing's mother said during the speak bitterness meeting, "You killed my eldest son, leaving only a child and an old man, making it impossible for my whole family to live!" Wang Zangzhen colluded with the Kuomintang bandit Zhang Wendou and organized the Second Government in Ningnan in 1928 of the Republic of China, and set up a tax card at Shijiazui Village to privately collect heavy taxes, causing the deaths of eleven people, including two families that were wiped out. Finally, the masses unanimously agreed to send them to the government for legal processing.

　　宁南万余翻身农民公审蒋特索还血债
    【本报威县六日电】宁南万余翻身农民公审蒋特田恭尧、李泽民、王臧珍等，清算七十多条人命的血债。李泽民系恶霸地主，事变后曾组织联庄会，杀人抢掠，无恶不作。曾带领土匪打进东汪，用铡刀铡死九人，砍死二十余人，共计害死人命四十五条。诉苦时，东汪西镇赵乃戍的老娘，带领着寡媳及孤苦的小孙女，指着李泽民说：“你把俺儿赵乃戍给铡了三截，又气死俺老头子，俺与你到底有什么仇啊？”她寡媳一面打着李泽民，一面嚎啕大哭。小孙女两手抚着眼睛，不住的抽咽。最后老太太举着手喊道：“你们这些特务，都是蒋介石派来的；你们小老蒋杀人，大老蒋给你们撑腰，蒋介石还我的儿来！”田恭尧是当地大恶霸，历年在东汪附近村庄进行造谣、破坏、瓦解、暗杀的特务活动，由他手中杀死的人命九条，一手制造了南丁曹大血案，杀死农会主任侯福庆等七人。福庆娘在诉苦时说：“你把俺大儿子杀死，只剩下一个小孩和老爹，害得俺一家老小没法过日子！”王臧珍曾勾结国特匪徒张文斗，于民国二十八年在宁南组织第二政府，在史家嘴村设立税卡，私抽重税，前后被其害死人命十一条，内有两户被杀光。最后群众一致通过送政府依法处理。
