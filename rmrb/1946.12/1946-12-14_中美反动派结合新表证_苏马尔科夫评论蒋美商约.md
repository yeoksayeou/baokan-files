Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Moscow Radio on the 10th broadcast commentator Markov's commentary on the Sino-American Commercial Navigation Friendship Treaty, saying: "This treaty is a new manifestation of the collusion between Chinese reactionaries and American monopoly capital; the purpose of this collusion is to strengthen anti-democratic dictatorship at the expense of the survival interests of the Chinese people." Markov also said: "The treaty has further colonized China. Never in Chinese history has a treaty been more deprived of China's national sovereignty than this one. What is the meaning of the treaty's so-called equality and friendship? China does not have the necessary merchant fleet to exercise such 'rights,' and Chinese investment in the United States is even more empty talk. While the United States trumpets equality on the one hand, it is unwilling to abolish the immigration laws restricting Chinese entry on the other. The Sino-American Commercial Navigation Friendship Treaty actually only guarantees the United States unrestricted destruction of China's national industry and commerce. The so-called 'equal opportunity' and 'open door' are just cunning tricks used by American speculators to consolidate their overseas markets and cannot deceive the eyes of the Chinese people."

    中美反动派结合新表证
    苏马尔科夫评论蒋美商约
    【新华社延安十一日电】莫斯科十日广播苏评论员马尔科夫评中美商业通航友好条约说：“此约是中国反动分子与美国垄断资本结合的新表证；这种结合目的是用中国人民生存利益的代价，加强反民主的独裁。”马尔科夫又说：“条约已使中国更加殖民地化，中国历史上从未有一条约比此更剥夺了中国民族的主权，条约的所谓平等友好，有何意义？中国并无实行此种‘权利’的必须的商船队，中国向美投资更是空话。美国方面一方面标榜平等，一方面却甚至不愿废除限制华人入境的移民法，中美商业通航友好条约实际上只是保证美国在华无限制地摧残中国民族工商业。所谓‘机会均等’‘门户开放’等花言巧语，只是美国投机家用来巩固其国外市场的奸猾手法，不能欺骗中国人民的眼睛。”
