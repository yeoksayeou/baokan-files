　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th (Delayed Dispatch): Paris dispatch: After the breakdown of cabinet formation negotiations among French parties, Blum formed an all-Socialist provisional cabinet on the afternoon of the 16th. Blum serves as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, with Gouin serving as Minister of State, Duguay as Minister of Defense, Philip as Minister of Economy and Finance, former Prime Minister Gouin as Minister of Economic Planning, Mabu as Minister of the Interior, and Lamadi as Minister of Justice. The cabinet eliminated the Minister of Propaganda and Information. This Socialist cabinet will be short-lived. Once the official president is elected in mid-January next year, a new prime minister will be appointed to form a permanent cabinet. One of the important reasons for the breakdown of cabinet formation negotiations among the parties is that the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) and the Radical Party stubbornly opposed the appointment of a Communist as Minister of Defense. The French Communist Party (PCF) firmly demanded the position of Minister of Defense and was willing to have its three departments of the army, navy, and air force be headed by members of the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Radical Party, respectively. Another important reason is that extreme right-wing elements are trying to participate in the cabinet. The PCF's newspaper, L'Humanité, commented on the matter, criticizing the Popular Republican Movement, right-wing parties, and the Radical Party for opposing the appointment of a Communist as Minister of Defense, calling it "an insult to the general election and the behavior of the PCF." The left-wing newspaper Franc-Tireur said: "The right-wing is hindering the emergence of the democratic government that the French people expect. Their sole purpose is to delay the continued chaos of the crisis and sow the seeds of a major disaster in order to profit from it."

　　法国组阁谈判破裂
    勃伦姆组清一色临时政府
    【新华社延安十八日电】（迟到）巴黎讯：在法国各党派组阁谈判破裂之后，勃伦姆于十六日下午组织清一色的社会党的临时内阁，勃伦姆任总理兼外长，国务员为毛莱，杜盖克任国防部长，菲利浦任经济财政部长，前总理古恩任经济计划部长，麦布任内政部长，拉玛迪任司法部长。部阁中取消了宣传与情报部长。此一社会党内阁将是短命内阁，一俟明年一月中旬正式总统选出后，将任命新总理组织永久内阁。各党组阁谈判破裂的重要原因之一，为人民共和运动党及急进党固执反对共产党人任国防部长，法共坚决要求国防部长职位，并愿将其下陆海空三处由社会党、人民共和运动党、急进党分别担任。另一重要原因，为极右派分子力图参加内阁。法共机关报人道报于评论此事时，抨击人民共和运动党、右翼政党及急进党反对共产党人出任国防部长的要求，称之为“侮辱大选与法共的行为”。左翼义勇军报称：“右派阻碍法国人民所期待的民主政府之产生，其唯一目的是拖延危机的继续混乱，散播大灾难的种籽，以便从中取利”。
