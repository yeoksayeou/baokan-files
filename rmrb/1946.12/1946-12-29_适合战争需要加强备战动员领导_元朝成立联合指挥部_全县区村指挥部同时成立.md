　　[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 25th dispatch] To adapt to the needs of the war, Yuan Dynasty has established a joint command of the Party, government, military, people and armed forces, with County Chief Zhu and Wu Committee Director Ma serving as commander and deputy commander, respectively. County Party Secretary Comrade Zhang Xincun serves as political commissar, and Anti-Japanese Alliance Director Sun serves as political director. The command has a military section, responsible for leading the militia in combat, guarding, and intelligence work; a war support section, responsible for civilian porters, stretchers, and vehicles; a supply section, responsible for the supply of military materials; and a liaison section, responsible for contacting local troops and rear institutions to resolve other difficulties. The command has now begun collective office work and has issued a notice to all district chiefs, Wu Committee directors, and grain and forage assistants, to detach from the office work for district command personnel. District and village commands have now been established. Militia and self-defense forces practice martial arts during the day and stand guard at night to prevent armed special agents from operating. In addition, forty strong and able militia members have been transferred from the Fifth District, led by the District Wu Committee director, to operate in the enemy-contact area to protect the masses and prepare for war safely.
