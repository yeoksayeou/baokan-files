(Taiyue News, December 9th) The fruit distribution in Xigao Village, Jincheng County, is relatively reasonable. As a result, the village has rapidly achieved the initial realization of "land to the tiller". Their distribution method, from beginning to end, whether the fruit belongs to the whole village or to individuals, is not primarily based on "struggle" but on "family circumstances" and needs, and is unified through democratic discussion. During the first struggle last winter, when eight shi of grain were calculated, apart from leaving two dou for each of the ten-odd people who participated in the struggle, the rest was distributed to eighty poor farmers according to their "circumstances." After this distribution, the number of participants in the struggle immediately expanded to one hundred and twenty households. During the second fruit distribution, they were divided into three classes according to class background: the poorest were in the first class, poor peasants in the second class, and middle peasants in the third class. By April of this year, when the rent reduction movement was popularized throughout the village, their method of distributing fruit became even more detailed and complete. First, they calculated that each person in the village had an average of more than four mu of land. Taking this "circumstance" as the main basis, those close to four mu received less, and those far from four mu received more. At the same time, everyone's level of activity and the amount of "struggle" were also used as supplementary conditions, and the number of shares was adjusted accordingly. After everyone discussed and divided into three classes in this way, the most were designated as twenty-five shares, the next most as eighteen shares, and the least as ten shares, to fill the needs. Everyone was satisfied with this method of distribution mainly based on "circumstances" and needs. In addition, in order to make the distribution more even and reasonable, they also determined several supplementary measures: First, to take care of the large gap caused by too many or too few people in a household, it was decided to give special consideration to households with one person, adding five shares to ensure that they could also turn over. For households with too many people, it was decided to use three people as the standard, and four, five... were all calculated as three. Second, to take care of those who did not get land or houses, they could also share other items of fruit. Their method was to take out a portion of furniture and farm tools, and distribute them separately to those who did not get land or houses, so that the distribution of fruit was wider and everyone was satisfied. As a result of implementing the above methods in Xigao, landlords and the poorest have been eliminated. There are four rich peasant households, with an average of 6.5 mu of land per person; thirteen well-to-do middle peasant households, with an average of slightly less than six mu of land per person; two hundred and thirteen middle peasant households, with an average of 4.2 mu per person; and thirty-seven poor peasant households (some of which were descended from despots and others who were purged), with an average of 2.4 mu of land per person.

    西郜村分果实办法公平合理
    按需分配人人满意
    【本报太岳九日电】晋城西郜村，分配果实较为合理。该村因此得以迅速初步实现耕者有其田。其分配办法，自始至终无论属于全村的或属于个人的果实，都不是以问题为主，而是根据“家庭情况”与需要，经过民主讨论统一的分配。当去冬第一次斗争，算出八石粮食时，除参加斗争的十余人每人留下二斗外，其余即按“情况”分给八十户贫苦农民。经过这样分配，参加斗争的马上扩大至一百二十户。第二次分配果实时，即按成份分成三等：赤贫第一等，贫农第二等，中农第三等。至今年四月，减租运动普及全村，他们分配果实的办法也就更加细密与完整，即首先算出全村每人平均四亩多土地，以此种“情况”为主要依据，距四亩近的少分，距四亩远的多分，同时将大家积极程度，问题多少等亦作为附带条件，斟酌加减份数。这样经大家讨论分成三等，最多的划为二十五份，次多的十八份，最少的十份，按需要填平。这种主要按“情况”与需要分配的办法，大家都满意。另外他们为了分得更加均匀合理，还确定了几个补充办法：一，是照顾因人口太多太少而形成的较大差额，决定一户一人的特别照顾，另加五份，保证他也能翻身。对一户人口过多的决定以三口为准，四口、五口……都以三口计算。二、是照顾没得地房的人，也能分到其他物品果实。他们的办法是，将一部家具农具等抽出，另外分给没得地房的，这样使果实的分配面更宽广了，大家都满意。西郜实行上述办法的结果，地主、赤贫都已消灭，计有富农四户，每人平均六亩五分地；富裕中农十三户，每人平均土地六亩弱；中农二百一十三户，每人平均四亩二分；贫农三十七户（其中有的户为恶霸等被清算下降者），每人平均二亩四分地。
