What are Their Intentions?
    Dongfang Man

　　The "Sino-American Agricultural Survey Mission" has been wandering around China for five or six months. According to the New York Times of the United States, these foreign dignitaries have reached an important conclusion:

    "The basic problem facing China today is overpopulation and insufficient arable land... The mission suggests that the Chinese government seriously consider various measures to deal with the population problem. The only way is to control reproduction, otherwise China will continue to have hardship crises and rebellions of desperate people." (American News Service in Peiping, November 26th, quoting the New York Times' commentary on the 23rd, as published in the "Min Qiang Daily.")

    Wonderful! Our liberated areas are distributing pamphlets in rural areas on "How to Raise a Baby," advocating "prosperity for both people and wealth," while these Americans want us to "reduce the population"! No wonder the American puppet emperor "Chiang Kai-shek" has solemnly adopted various measures and implemented them, such as: using American planes and cannons to kill, using the Yellow River to flood, using grain requisitions to starve, using conscription laws to pull people in... countless examples, all with "remarkable results." The American foreign dignitaries can rest assured and work with Chinese traitors to jointly create an "agricultural China," without worrying about rebellions of "desperate people"!

    The Shanghai English-language "China Weekly Review" published two articles last month by a foreigner (mostly likely an American) self-identified as a "Former Friend of China," along with commentary, saying that there should be a "Better to Go to Hell than Stay in China Movement":

    "...They (referring to all Chinese people - editor) have no sense of collective responsibility, caring only about their own families and nothing else. They have no compassion, no sense of moral justice, no honesty, loyalty, dignity, or any other symbol that would show them to be superior to beasts—those beasts they mistreat to the extreme. Having so many inherent flaws as mentioned above, they still shout and scream like a dog biting the hand that feeds it: 'Please, all you foreigners, get out of China together.'"

    Therefore, I now suggest to all foreigners in China a "Better to Go to Hell than Stay in China Movement," and every country should withdraw any donations to China. We should immediately stop all loans and aid to China..." (This article was published in the "Reader's Words" column of the "Wenhui Daily" on November 16th).

    This vividly depicts the psychology of American imperialists insulting the Chinese people. Does he really want to "not stay in China"? No, he wants to force the Chinese people to be slaves forever. May I ask who is it that truly signs agreements and doesn't take responsibility, manipulates civil war and slaughters Chinese people, has no sense of morality, justice, honesty, loyalty, or dignity, and only knows how to control China and dominate the world? Isn't it precisely the American "special envoys," "ambassadors," and their pack of wolves and dogs?

    Get out! Since your year-plus of stationing troops, loans, and mediation has turned most of China into something worse than hell, you should all go to hell as soon as possible!

　　是何居心？
    东方漫
    “中美农业考察团”到中国来逛荡了五六个月。据美国的纽约时报告诉我们，这些洋大人已经得到一个重要结论了，那结论是：
    “中国目前面临之基本问题为人口过多，而可耕之田不足……。该使团建议中国政府郑重考虑各种措施，借以对付人口问题，唯一办法为管制生殖，否则中国将继续有困苦危机及亡命之徒之叛乱。”（北平美新闻处十一月二十六日电引纽约时报二十三日评论，载《民强报》。）
    妙哉！我们解放区在农村散发“怎样养娃娃”，提倡“人财两旺”，而这些美国人却要我们“减少人口”！怪不得美国的儿皇帝“蒋该死”，郑重采取了各种措施，实行在案，像：用美国飞机、大炮来杀，用黄河堵口来淹，用粮食征实来饿，用征兵法令来拉，……不胜枚举，莫不“卓著成效”。美国洋大人可以安心和中国卖国贼来共同制造“农业中国”，不必担心“亡命之徒”的叛乱了！

    上海英文大美晚报上个月曾两次刊登一位自署“前任中国之友”的外国人（多半是美国人）的文章，并加以评论，说是要来一个“宁入地狱，勿留中国运动”：
    “……他们（按指一切中国人——编者）没有团体责任心，除了对自己的家外，对什么都不关心。没有恻隐心，没有道德正义观念，没有诚实、忠信、尊严或其他一切足以表现他们是高出于禽兽——那些被他们虐待得无微不至的禽兽——一等的象征。他们既有了如上所说的许多劣根性，还要像一只狗咬着喂他东西吃的手的那样大呼大嚷：“请你们外侨一起滚出中国”。
    所以我现在对全中国的外侨建议一个“宁入地狱，弗留中国”运动，并且每一个国家收回任何对于中国的捐助，我们应该立刻停止对华的一切借款及教济……”（该文载“文汇报十一月十六日《读者的话》栏”）。
    这再清楚也没有地活画出美国帝国主义分子侮辱中国人的心理。他真的要“勿留中国”么？不，他是要迫使中国人永作奴隶。试问真正签了字不负责，操纵内战屠杀中国人，毫无道德、正义、诚实、忠义尊严之感，只知控制中国、独霸世界的是谁呢？不正是美国的什么“特使”、“大使”狼群走狗之流么？
    滚吧，你们一年多来的驻军、贷款、调停既然把大部分中国搞得连地狱也不如，你们还是早点滚进地狱的好！
