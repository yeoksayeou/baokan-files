　　Overturned Peasants Dedicate Weapons to Arm Themselves:
    Chen Village Establishes Liberation Brigade
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] After the peasants of Chen Village, Zanhuang, were emancipated, they automatically dedicated weapons to establish people's armed forces in order to protect the benefits of their emancipation. Some special agents, landlords, local bullies and other feudal leaders in the village, after being purged by the masses, secretly colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops in Yuanshi City, attempting to "restore the old order." After Liu Lu, director of the village's Armed Forces Committee, and Tian Huaizhi, principal of the People's School, discovered this, they immediately led the masses in discussions. As a result, the masses' awareness was greatly enhanced. Tian Huaizhi then called for the establishment of a Liberation Brigade, which was unanimously supported by the masses. In addition to the existing militia, twenty-one new members joined the brigade within five days, and many peasants automatically dedicated the earthen cannons they had preserved for many years. Currently, the brigade has eleven usable earthen cannons, and four more will be repaired soon. Everyone is in high spirits and is now stepping up military training and actively preparing for war.

　　翻身农民献出武器武装自己
    陈村成立解放大队
    【本报长治讯】赞皇陈村农民翻身后，为了保卫翻身利益，自动献出武器，成立人民武装。该村某些特务、地主、恶霸等封建头子，被群众清算后，竟不断与元氏城内之蒋伪军暗中勾结，企图“复辟”。村武委会主任刘禄与民校校长田怀志发觉后，即领导群众进行讨论，结果群众觉悟大大提高。田怀志即号召成立解放大队，群众一致拥护，纷纷自动参加该队，除原有民兵外，五天内新参加者，即有二十一人，许多农民并将多年保存的土炮自动献出。现该队能用的土炮已有十一门，还有四门不久即可修好。大家情绪极高，现正抓紧进行练武，积极备战。
