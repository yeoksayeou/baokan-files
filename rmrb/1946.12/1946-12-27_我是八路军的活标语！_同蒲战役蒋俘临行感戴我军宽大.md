　　“I am a living slogan of the Eighth Route Army!”
     Chiang Kai-shek prisoners of war in the Tongpu Campaign express gratitude for our army’s leniency before departing
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 23rd dispatch] The Taiyue Military Region sent back 34 Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons during the Tongpu Campaign on the 11th, including Captain Bin of the 206th Regiment of the 69th Division, and Lieutenant and Deputy Company Commander Wan Shiming of the Machine Gun Company of the 78th Brigade, to their hometowns. Before their departure, the military region held a farewell banquet and issued each person between 1,500 and 3,000 legal tender, 0.6 kg of provisions per day, and a release certificate. In addition to this, they also received 24 yuan for vegetables and 30 yuan for preferential treatment each day. During the temporary forum, most people were moved to tears. Sergeant Qin Xianjian of the 47th Division said: “The Eighth Route Army’s lenient policy is not fake. They do what they say. Today’s release home proves that the Eighth Route Army does not speak empty words. Some time ago, the weather was cold, and the cadres hadn’t even put on cotton-padded clothes yet, but they issued them to us first. They treat us like their own brothers. I will never forget this even in death.” Zhou Bin, a captain serving in the 206th Regiment of the 69th Division, said: “After I go home, I will greatly publicize the Eighth Route Army’s propositions. I want to become a flesh and blood slogan of the Eighth Route Army. I am a living slogan of the Eighth Route Army, and even as a ghost, I will still be a slogan for the Eighth Route Army.” Chen Qinghua, a soldier of the New First Brigade, said: “Chiang Kai-shek dragged me into the fire pit, and the Eighth Route Army pulled me out of the fire pit. Chiang Kai-shek is a living King Yama, and the Eighth Route Army is my savior.” Before leaving, they were all tearful, reluctant to leave, and said in unison: “Rest assured! We will never forget you.”

　　“我是八路军的活标语！”
     同蒲战役蒋俘临行感戴我军宽大
    【本报太岳二十三日电】太岳军区于十一日遣送同蒲战役放下武器之蒋阎军官兵，六十九师二○六团上尉彬，七十八旅机枪连中尉副连长万氏民等三十四人回籍。临行前军区特设宴饯行，并发给每人法币一千五百元到三千元，给养每天斤六，释放证一张，除此而外，每天又发给菜金二十四元，优待费三十元。在临时座谈会上，大多数人感激得流下泪来。四十七师上士秦先俭说：“八路军宽大政策不是假的，说什是什，今日释放回家，证明八路军不说一句空话，前些时天气冷，干部都还没有穿棉衣，先给我们发下来，对我们真如亲兄弟一样，我死也不能忘记。”六九师二○六团上尉服务员周彬说：“我回家后一定把八路军的主张大大宣传，我要变成八路军的肉标语，我活是八路军的一张肉标语，我死也是八路军的一条鬼。”新一旅士兵陈青华说：“蒋介石拉我到火坑里，八路军把我从火坑里拉出来，蒋介石是活阎王，八路军是救命恩人。”临行时都含着热泪，恋恋不舍，异口同声语：“放心吧！我们永不会忘记你们的。”
