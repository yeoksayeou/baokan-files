　　New Methods for Soldiers' Learning
    Recently, a certain unit of the New Fourth Army in Central China created an outstanding experience in conducting combat reviews and learning combat techniques using new methods, highly promoting the initiative and creativity of soldiers and cadres. After inflicting annihilating blows on the enemy and achieving brilliant victories, they were not complacent. They immediately utilized the short combat intervals to seriously study, starting from a single action or the loss of a single person, how to annihilate more enemies, how to reduce unnecessary losses, and how to better complete the sacred task of the patriotic self-defense war. The main characteristic of this experience is that it starts from the actual problems closely related to each soldier, reviewing and improving their own thoughts and actions; at the same time, it adopts the mass line learning method, without using injection or rigid methods. Because the soldiers' learning enthusiasm is high, it has achieved great practical results. This review will play a great role in improving the combat effectiveness of the troops and is one of the new signs of the rising new heroism in the troops. It further combines our army's tradition of serving the people without fear of sacrifice, its vigorous attacking spirit, and its style of unity from top to bottom in overcoming all difficulties with modern technology, so as to more effectively annihilate the enemy and preserve ourselves. Today, when the entire army is learning to fight better mobile warfare and positional warfare, the learning of combat techniques and tactical actions is very important. The Central China troops have already set a very good example in this regard. The entire People's Liberation Army should learn from their experience well and create a universal learning upsurge to rapidly improve its combat effectiveness and defeat Chiang Kai-shek's invading army.

　　战士学习的新方法
    最近华中新四军某部创造了以新方法进行战斗检讨，学习战斗技术，高度发扬战士和干部积极性创造性的出色经验。他们在给敌人以歼灭打击取得辉煌胜利之后，毫不自满，立即利用短暂的战斗间隙，认真的从一个动作或一个人员的损失出发，具体研究如何能更多的歼灭敌人，如何减少不必要的损失，更好的完成爱国自卫战争的神圣任务。这一经验的主要特点，是从战士每一个切身有关的实际问题出发，检讨与改进自己的思想和行动；同时采取群众路线的学习方法，不用注入与刻板的方式。因为战士学习情绪高涨，收到很大的实际效果。这种检讨，对提高部队的战斗力将起很大作用，是部队中新英雄主义高涨的新标志之一。它是使我们部队为人民服务不畏牺牲的传统旺盛的攻击精神与上下团结克服一切困难的作风，进一步和近代技术相结合，更有效的歼灭敌人，保存自己。在今天，全军学习更好的打运动战打据点的时候，战斗技术与战术动作的学习是十分重要的。华中部队在这方面已经作出了很好的榜样，全体人民解放军应该很好的学习他们的经验，并造成一个普遍的学习热潮，以迅速提高自己的战斗力，打垮蒋介石的进犯军。（十二月十八日）
