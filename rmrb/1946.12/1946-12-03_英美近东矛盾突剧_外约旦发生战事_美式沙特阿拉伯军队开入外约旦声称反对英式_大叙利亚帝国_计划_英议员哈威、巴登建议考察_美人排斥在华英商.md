Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 30th: War has broken out in the Middle East. According to reports from various news agencies in Ankara on the 28th, Saudi Arabian troops equipped by the United States have entered the border area of Transjordan, and fighting has already occurred. The Saudi Arabian side announced that the reason for the advance was to oppose the ambition of the newly enthroned King Abdullah of Transjordan. It is claimed that Abdullah, with British support, plans to connect Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq to form a "Syrian Empire" and seize oil rights between the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. This sudden war has heightened tensions in the Middle East. On the 28th, the Greek Deputy Foreign Minister, with a British background, made a special trip to Transjordan to express support for Abdullah. This incident shows that the Anglo-American struggle in the Near East has escalated into military action. Observers point out that the recent visit of American warships to the southwestern coast of Turkey (the American warships have not yet left) and the White House's announcement on the 23rd to upgrade the American legation in Iraq to an embassy are not unrelated to the current situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 28th: London dispatch: During a meeting of the British House of Commons on the afternoon of the 25th, Conservative MP Harvey and Labour MP Baden suggested that the government send a delegation to China to investigate the difficulties faced by British businessmen in China and the situation of Americans excluding British people in China. The British Under-Secretary of State replied that the time was not yet ripe, but it could be realized when necessary.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 28th: According to Reuters Shanghai, the British Trade Mission to China, after touring North and Central China for six weeks, is scheduled to fly to Taiwan and Southern China on the 30th for visits, and then return home. On the 27th, Mr. Coates, the head of the delegation, gave a radio broadcast in Shanghai, emphasizing that restoring export trade is one of the first and most pressing conditions for China's construction. He said: "Chinese exports are more adaptable to China's needs than before the war. The problem lies in actually being able to transport the exports and sell them to us at a price that is about the same as selling to those 'who dominate the international market.'"

  　美式沙特阿拉伯军队开入外约旦声称反对英式“大叙利亚帝国”计划
  　英议员哈威、巴登建议考察
  　美人排斥在华英商
    【新华社延安十一月三十日电】中东爆发战事。据各通讯社安哥拉二十八日消息：美国装备的沙特阿拉伯军队开入外约旦边境地带，已发生战事。沙特阿拉伯方面宣布，进军理由为反对新近登基的外约旦国王阿布拉杜的野心。据称，阿布拉杜在英国支持下，计划联接巴勒斯坦、叙利亚、黎巴嫩及伊拉克，组成“叙利亚帝国”，夺取地中海及波斯湾间的石油权。此突然的战事，已使中东局势为之紧张。二十八日，英背景的希腊外交部秘书长特赴外约旦，表示予阿布拉杜以支持。此一事件，显示美英在近东的斗争已演成武力行动。观察家指出：最近美舰访问土耳其西南海岸（按美舰迄未离去）及白宫二十三日公布将美国驻伊拉克公使馆升为大使馆，与目前发生的情势不无关系。
    【新华社延安十一月二十八日电】伦敦讯：英下院二十五日下午开会时，保守党议员哈威与工党议员巴登，建议政府派代表团来华，考察英商人在华所遭困难及美国人在华排斥英人之情况。英外次答辩时，表示目前时机未成熟，必要时可予实现。
    【新华社延安十一月二十八日电】据路透社上海讯：英国商务访华团在周游华北华中六周后，定于三十日飞台湾华南一带访问，随即返国。二十七日，该团团长柯埃斯在沪发表广播，强调恢复出口贸易是中国建设首先迫需的条件之一。渠称：“中国出口品适应中国需要者较战前范围更大，问题是在于真正能够把出口品运出来，并且卖给我们时，价钱要同卖给那些‘在国际市场上称霸的人们’差不多。”
