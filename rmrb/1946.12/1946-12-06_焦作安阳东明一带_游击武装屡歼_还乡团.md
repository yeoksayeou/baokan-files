　　Jiaozuo, Anyang, and Dongming area
  　Guerrilla forces repeatedly annihilate the "Homecoming Corps"
    [This newspaper, Anyang News] (Delayed) On November 22nd, the Anyang People's Revenge Detachment, in conjunction with the militia of Lin County and a unit of the 53rd Regiment, under the leadership of Directors Xu and Liu of the Military Affairs Committee, directly attacked the "Homecoming Corps" stronghold at Zidan, Shijian, on the Shuiye-Guantai highway, completely destroying the surrounding walls of the village and burning down the eight watchtowers. The flames were visible from dozens of miles away. The enemy was terrified, and the people's morale was greatly boosted. The detachment is now approaching the outskirts of Shuiye. (Shi Hong)
    [This newspaper] Comrade Ren Xiuhe of the Jiaozuo First District led twelve militiamen from the district to Yanhe on the morning of the 18th of last month to scout the enemy situation and prepare to capture Chiang's special agents in the village at night. Unexpectedly, they encountered more than eighty grain-grabbing enemies returning to Yanhe just as they reached Honghe Ridge. Ren Xiuhe was alert and decisive, quickly arranged the battle, occupied the hilltop, and fired at the enemy. Militiamen Ge Quanxing and two others took advantage of the enemy's confusion to rush down the hill and wound the enemy sentry. Lian Qiyi and Jin Liucai killed one enemy soldier each, and Ren Xiuhe also killed one enemy soldier, wounding a total of eleven enemies. We suffered no casualties. Ten minutes later, the enemy from Yanhe rushed to reinforce, but our militiamen had already safely withdrawn. In this battle, Ren and others also recovered all the grain and property looted by the enemy and returned it to the masses. (Dong, Zhen)
    [This newspaper, Jilu Yu, 4th] Local corps, guerrilla teams, and militia active behind enemy lines in southwestern Shandong, under the slogan of "Protecting the Home and Defending the People," have been fighting bravely and winning successive battles. On the morning of November 10th, the First Battalion of the Dongming County Militia ambushed the Chiang Kai-shek's "Homecoming Corps" harassing from Yuzhou Village, killing and wounding twelve Chiang agents; on the 16th, a unit of our guerrilla corps raided the stubborn puppet district government offices in Diaotun and Lizhuang at night, killing more than ten enemies, capturing four alive, and seizing six rifles; in the middle of the night on the 17th, our guerrilla forces, with swift action, fiercely attacked the Chiang special agent Chi Wei's unit of the "Homecoming Corps" in Yuzhou Village, twelve miles east of Dongming city. When our troops stormed into the village from the northeast corner of the stockade, the enemy sentries were still warming themselves by the fire. Our heroic "divine soldiers" ended the battle in just over ten minutes, capturing more than fifty enemies alive, killing more than ten, and seizing one light machine gun, more than fifty long and short guns, and a portion of military supplies. The news of the elimination of the Homecoming Corps in Yuzhou Village spread throughout the villages for dozens of miles. An old lady from Dongbei City said, "Oh my God, this is great! This bunch of bad eggs robbed our village of several thousand catties of wheat as soon as they arrived! All the chickens were taken away! This time we've got our revenge!" As these prisoners walked through Liubei Village with their heads down, the masses crowded the streets, excitedly and angrily cursing, "I told you to bully us again? You've only been mixed up for two days, and the Eighth Route Army has arrested you!"
