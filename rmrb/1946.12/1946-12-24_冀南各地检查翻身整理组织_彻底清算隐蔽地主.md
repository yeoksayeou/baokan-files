Southern Hebei Areas Inspect and Reorganize Turnaround Organizations
	Thoroughly Liquidate Hidden Landlords
[Our newspaper, Weixian, 22nd dispatch] In the past mass movements in Southern Hebei, evil landlords used conspiracies and tricks to evade struggle and continue to exploit the masses. In this turnaround general inspection movement, they have been thoroughly liquidated. In Lujiazhuang, Fourth District of Qiu County, evil landlord Lu Fengzhou fled to Yichang Flower Shop in Weixian to work as an accountant. When the masses in the village wanted to settle accounts with him, he immediately returned with a fake letter, scaring the masses by saying: "I have a letter from the higher-ups, asking me to voluntarily 'dedicate land.' Whoever struggles against me, I will go to Weixian to file a lawsuit." At the same time, he tried to bribe the Women's Association director with 3,000 yuan but was refused. During this inspection and rent reduction movement, after discussion, the masses in the village saw through his conspiracy and immediately took an oath, reorganized the organization, and launched a resolute struggle against him. In Haoduanzhai, Second District, lawless landlord Hao Mengyue secretly assumed the position of Farmers' Association director before the rent reduction, continuing to rule the masses. This time, he participated in the district-wide arrangement meeting for rent reduction. After returning to the village, he colluded with evil landlord Hao Mengyi, temporarily appointed a few bad elements as group leaders, manipulated and forced the masses, detained four middle peasants and one rich peasant for struggle. After being discovered by the sub-district representatives, they immediately united the farmers of the entire sub-district to help the masses of Haoduanzhai, and overthrew Hao Mengyue and Hao Mengyi. In Beiniu Village, Second District of Yaoshan, evil landlord Kong Qinglin, at the beginning of last year's mass movement, pretended to be benevolent and righteous by helping the masses buy cattle and rolling carts, and treating village cadres to food and drink, thus evading struggle. During the second struggle, he again bribed the village cadres to quickly distribute the "struggle grain" to the masses, thus getting rid of the struggle. In the third mass movement, he first divided his family, bribed the village cadres, and while promoting that he was poor, detained himself for a fake struggle, only fined 700 yuan and five trees. During this inspection and rent reduction, after in-depth investigation, he was thoroughly exposed, the masses united, overthrew Kong Qinglin, and replaced the running-dog village cadres. In Daijiatun, Second District of Qinghe, evil landlord Dai Yichen, last year, because individual village cadres sheltered him during the struggle, not only did he not bow his head to the masses, but he ran to Tianjin to spread rumors. During this inspection and rent reduction, the masses again thoroughly settled accounts with him. Landlord Duan Futing of Huajianacun, nicknamed "Eastern Despot," speculatively "dedicated land" during this inspection and rent reduction. After research, the masses saw through his conspiracy to exploit loopholes, and immediately launched a rational struggle against him. His cunning tricks ultimately did not succeed.
[Our newspaper, Taiyue, 20th dispatch] When clearing the feudal remnants in Tunliu County, it was discovered that one of the reasons why many villages had not realized "land to the tiller" was that many landlords and despots had not been liquidated, but were hiding in mountain villages and shacks, or hiding far away. For example, the original big landlord of the village, Yan Junkong, his entire family of five completely hid to avoid struggle, and the peasants could not settle accounts with them. Jiao Cunbao's family in Gelugou hid four evil landlords, and even shared the fruits of the masses' struggle in the name of refugees. After inspection and rent reduction, the peasants in each village looked for them to go home and settle accounts. Four landlord despots in Gelugou have been re-liquidated by the peasants. At the same time, each village has become vigilant about this phenomenon and is checking whether there are landlords and despots from other villages hiding in their own villages.

　　冀南各地检查翻身整理组织
    彻底清算隐蔽地主
    【本报威县二十二日电】冀南过去群运中，恶霸地主利用阴谋诡计逃避斗争，继续压榨群众，在此次翻身大检查运动中，已得到彻底的清算。邱县四区路家庄恶霸地主路凤洲逃往威县义昌花店任会计，该村群众要向他清算时，他即返回，手持假信，吓唬群众说：“我有上级的信，叫我自动‘献田’，谁斗，我到威县打官司。”同时以三千元收买妇会主任遭到拒绝。这次查减运动中，该村群众经过讨论，识破他的阴谋，随即进行宣誓，整理组织，对他开展了坚决斗争。二区郝段寨，不法地主郝梦月，查减前窃任农会主任，继续统治群众；这次他参加全区布置查减会议，回村后与恶霸地主郝梦义同谋，临时指定几个坏蛋当小组长，操纵强迫群众，扣起四个中农，一个富农，进行斗争，经过小区代表发现后，马上联合全小区农民，帮助郝段寨群众，斗倒了郝梦月、郝梦义。尧山二区北牛村恶霸地主孔庆林，去年群运开始，假仁假义的帮群众买牛买轧车，请村干部吃喝，逃避了斗争。第二次斗争时，又收买村干将“斗争粮食”迅速分给群众，摆脱了斗争。第三次群运中，他首先分家，收买村干，一面宣传他穷了，一面扣起他来假斗争，只罚了七百元，五棵树。这次查减中经深入调查，彻底揭露，群众团结起来，斗垮了孔庆林，撤换了狗腿村干。清河二区代家屯，恶霸地主戴一臣，去年因斗争中，个别村干走里庇护他，不但未向群众低头，反而跑到天津，大肆造谣。这次查减中，群众又对他进行了彻底清算。华家那村地主段福庭，外号东霸天，这次查减中投机“献田”，群众经过研究，识破他这钻空子的阴谋，随即对他展开说理斗争，其狡猾奸计终未得逞。
    【本报太岳二十日电】屯留全县在清算封建尾巴时，发现很多村子未实现耕者有其田的原因之一，系许多地主恶霸未被清算，而隐蔽在山庄窝铺，或远出躲藏，如原村大地主阎俊孔，全家五个人完全隐蔽起来躲避斗争，农民无法与其清算，圪芦沟焦存宝家就隐藏着四个恶霸地主，还以难民为名分得群众斗争果实。经查减后，各村农民纷纷找寻他们回家算账，圪芦沟四户地主恶霸，已被农民重新清算，同时各村已警惕这种现象，正检查本村有无隐藏他村地主恶霸。
