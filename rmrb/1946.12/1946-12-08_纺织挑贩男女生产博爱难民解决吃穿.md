　　[Bo'ai News from this Newspaper] More than two thousand refugees (mostly village cadres and militia family members) who were transferred from this county a few days ago have now been settled and are actively engaged in production to solve the problem of food and clothing. The government loan of 1.53 million yuan and the fruits of struggle brought by the refugees themselves have solved the difficulty of production funds. The refugees voluntarily form production groups based on natural villages. The group leader leads the discussion and plans for production, with a division of labor and cooperation so that everyone is busy. Able-bodied people carry goods for sale, the elderly and weak grind flour and set up stalls, women weave, and women who are semi-sick or have children cook. In addition to a 10% bonus for production personnel, the production dividends are bought into grain by group and distributed every three days. The refugees in each district, in addition to their own consumption, have already earned a profit of more than 139,000 yuan. Districts 1, 4, and 5 have also solved the problem of cotton clothing. Before receiving the loan, District 4 went down the mountain and seized four shi of grain from the hands of Chiang Kai-shek's puppets as capital. In more than 20 days of production, in addition to living expenses, they earned a net profit of four shi of millet, enabling 107 people to wear upper body cotton clothing. In District 1, three production groups earned a net profit of more than 20,000 yuan in just over ten days. With the help of the cooperative, most women participated in weaving, earning one dou and six sheng of millet for every jin of first-class thread, one dou and four sheng of millet for every jin of second-class thread, and one dou of millet for every jin of third-class thread. There are also rewards for particularly good factories. Relying solely on weaving can solve the livelihood problem of women. (Wang Jinwen)

　　纺织挑贩男女生产博爱难民解决吃穿
    【本报博爱讯】本县日前转移出来的两千多难民（大部是村干部和民兵家属），现已安置就绪，并在积极生产中解决了穿吃问题。政府贷款百五十三万元及难民自带的斗争果实，解决了生产资金的困难。难民以自然村为单位，自愿结成生产小组，组长领导讨论计划生产，分工合作，人人不闲。全劳力肩挑贩卖，老弱磨面摆摊，妇女纺织，半病及有小孩的妇女作饭。生产红利除提百分之十奖励生产人员外，以组为单位买成粮食，每三日分发一次。各区难民除消耗外，已赚红利十三万九千余元，一、四、五区还解决了棉衣问题。四区在未贷款前，下山从蒋伪手中夺回四石粮食作资金，二十多天生产，除生活消耗外，净赚了四石小米，使一百零七人穿上了上身棉衣。一区三个生产小组，十多天中净赚二万余元。在合作社帮助下，大部妇女参加了纺织，交一等线一斤赚小米一斗六升，二等线一斤一斗四升，三等线一斤一斗。特别好的工厂还有奖励。单靠纺织即可解决了妇女的生活问题。（王进文）
