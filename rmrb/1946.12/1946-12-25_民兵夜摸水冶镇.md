　　Militia Sneak Attack on Shuiye Town
    Shi Hong
    On the night of November 28th, Political Commissar Dong of the × District led several militiamen to post government notices in the North Gate of Shuiye and capture the reactionary landlord Yang Chunfang. With lightning speed, they bypassed the dense bunkers and guard posts on the Shui-Guan Highway and reached the east bank of the Zhushui River, just north of the North Gate.

    The sentries on the distant mountain road across the Zhushui River, the lights on the edge of the North Gate village, and the electric lights flashing on the city wall made them hesitate for a moment. Political Commissar Dong finally made up his mind, knowing the old saying, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger's cubs?" Deputy Brigade Commander Lü Bingquan also waved his hand and said, "Since we're here, we must complete the task." Quartermaster Yang Yuzhi and Song Chun'er echoed, "That's right, let's go!" They took off their cotton trousers, rolled up their shirts, and waded through the swift-flowing Zhushui River.

    The icy water and the relentless wind turned their legs to stone. However, time did not allow them to hesitate any longer, so they quickly crossed the river, put on their trousers, shouldered their guns, and advanced while searching.

    When they reached Dead Child Gully, the enemy soldiers on the city wall seemed to have spotted them and kept shining electric lights on them, so they left the highway, climbed to higher ground, and continued to advance. Approaching the city, they saw that there was no one on the highway, so they bent over and dashed to the base of the west wall of the North Gate. The Deputy Brigade Commander held a gun in one hand and the notices and leaflets in the other, pressing and scattering them along the way, pasting them on the walls they encountered. They walked along the base of the wall all the way to the edge of the North Gate entrance, where they stopped. The Deputy Brigade Commander walked ahead alone, looked up at the gate tower, and peeked into the street. The earth was asleep, and he was secretly pleased. He gestured to his comrades behind him, and a gust of wind swept into the southern alley where Yang Chunfang lived.

    The quartermaster and Chun'er guarded the intersection, one watching the east street and outside the entrance, and the other watching the west street. The Deputy Brigade Commander quietly approached Yang Chunfang's door, his ear pressed against the gate, hearing snores inside. He reported the situation to them, and they decided to climb over the wall. You support me, I pull you, and they quickly climbed over.

    This was a small courtyard. Yang Chunfang lived in the front yard, and to get to the front yard, they had to cross a pile of firewood. They thought: Should we cross? It will make noise. Should we move it? It will make even more noise. Since there will be noise anyway, the die is cast, so what is there to hesitate about? So the Deputy Brigade Commander decided to go first. Yang Yuzhi and Chun'er rested their guns on the firewood. If any enemies came to resist, they would cover their retreat. Who knew, the dog started barking as soon as he stepped on the firewood, scaring them so much that their hair stood on end and their hearts pounded wildly. The Deputy Brigade Commander suddenly remembered that he had two steamed buns in his pocket, so he took out the buns and fed them to the dog piece by piece. The dog not only stopped barking after eating but also followed the Deputy Brigade Commander to open the gate. He slowly pulled open the latch and carefully opened the gate. At this time, there was still no movement in the courtyard. The two of them quickly walked to the front of Yang Chunfang's bedroom. The quartermaster, with his gun on his back and a grenade in his hand, stood on one side of the door, and Chun'er, with a gun in one hand, patted on the window, "Who is it?" Yang Chunfang woke up from his dream and shouted loudly. Chun'er leaned against the window and said in a very low voice, "It's me," and then said, "Xu San is back, he has something to tell you." Xu San was the guy he sent to infiltrate our militia work and who was arrested by us. When Yang Chunfang heard that Xu San was back, he couldn't wait to fly out. He put on his clothes, dragged his shoes, and hurriedly came to open the door. The quartermaster grabbed his lapel, Chun'er put the bayonet against his heart, and the Deputy Brigade Commander pointed his pistol at the back of his head, "Go!" Yang Chunfang couldn't figure out how many people there were, so he had to follow them like a gust of wind to the × District.

    After this incident spread, cadres, militiamen, and the common people enthusiastically praised their heroic act. The Anyang County Command not only ordered commendations and rewards but also called on all militiamen to learn from these few individuals.

　　民兵夜摸水冶镇
    史洪
    十一月廿八日夜，×区董政委率领着几个民兵，要把政府布告张贴在水冶北关，并把反动地主杨春芳捉拿回来。他们以神速的动作，通过水观公路上密布的碉堡和岗楼，一直达到北关正北桥东的珠水边。
    珠水彼岸，远远山路上的哨兵，北关村边的灯火，闪耀在城头上的电光，使他们犹豫了一会。董政委最后终于下了决心，他知道一句老话，“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”。大队副吕炳全，也把手一挥说：“今天我们来看，总得完成任务”。火头军杨玉之和宋春儿也跟着说：“对，咱们走”，他们脱了棉裤卷起上衣，涉渡急流的珠水。
    冰冷的水，无情的风，使他们的腿变成坚硬。但是，时间不允许他们再有迟疑，只得很快地渡过河水穿起裤子，端起了枪，边走边搜索前进。
    当走到死孩沟时，城头上的敌兵像发现了他们似的，一直用电光向他们照射，他们便离开公路爬上高地继续前进。快到城边了，他们看了看公路上没有人，便弯着腰，一股劲冲到北关西墙根，大队副一手拿枪，一手拿着布告和传单，沿路压，沿路撒，碰到墙壁就粘贴，他们踏着墙根一直走到北关圈门边，住下脚。大队副独自走在前面，抬头瞧了瞧门楼，又伸头望了望大街。大地熟睡了，他心里窃喜着，他向后面同志打了个手势，一陈风窜进杨春芳住的南面胡同。
    火头军和春儿把着路口，一人监视东街和圈外，一人监视西面大街。大队副放轻脚步走近杨春芳门边，他的耳朵贴着大门，听到里面有鼾声，他向他们报告了情况，决定越墙而过。你扶我，我拉你，很快就爬了过去。
    这是个小院，杨春芳住在前院，想到前院，得越过一堆花柴。他们想：过吧，有响声，搬吧，声音更大，既然都有响声，生米已做成熟饭，还犹豫什么？于是大队副决定先过，杨玉之和春儿把枪架在花柴上，如有敌人来对抗，他们就掩护打退却。那知，一上花柴狗便叫起来，吓得他们头发都乍起来了，心＠＠直跳。大队副忽然想起自己口袋里还装着两个馒头，便取出馒头一块块的喂狗，狗得食不但停止叫声，还跟着大队副去开大门。他徐徐拉开门闩，慢慢的把门打开。这时院里还没有任何动静，他俩很快走到杨春芳寝室前，火头军背着枪，拿着手榴弹，站在门的一边，春儿一手拿枪，一手拍窗，“是谁”？杨春芳从梦中惊醒高声地喊着。春儿伏着窗子，用非常低微的声音说：“我”，接着说：“许三回来啦，他有话跟你说”。许三是被他派出来打入我民兵工作，而被我逮捕的家伙，杨春芳听说许三回来了，恨不得一下飞出来，他披上衣服，拖拉着鞋，连忙来开门。火头军见了他一把抓住他的衣裳襟，春儿把刺刀对在他的心口上，大队副的手枪对准他后脑勺，“走！”杨春芳摸不清人马有多少，只得跟着他们一阵风似的来到×区。
    这件事情传出后，干部、民兵、老百姓热烈的传颂着他们这一英勇的举动。安阳县指挥部除下令表扬奖励，并号召全体民兵向他们几位学习。
