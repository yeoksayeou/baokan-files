　　The Second Experience of Land Reform in Enxia:
　　Winning Over Everyone Who Can Be Won Over
　　Dong Ning
　　In the mass movement, some people were bought by the landlords and became the landlords' henchmen. Most of these people were basic members of the masses and were the landlords' "puppets" in ruling the masses. The masses hated them very much, but they often did not understand that they were also forced by poverty. Therefore, the leadership should grasp the spirit of fighting less, or using struggle to win over unity. The heads of the farmers' associations in Xiaoliguantun and Muwangzhuang in the Fifth District, and the village head of Menwangzhuang in the Sixth District, were all won over after struggle and unity.

　　There are two links to winning over these people: one is to isolate them in the masses for a short period of time to reduce their prestige; the other is to distribute the fruits of the struggle to achieve true unity. After discussion by the masses in the Sixth District, they generally gave them a "probationary period" for joining the farmers' association, first giving them half of the fruits of their labor, and the remaining half would be given to them when they became better, or when their children who had been bandits returned. The village cadres also constantly talked to them to achieve the goal of transformation. The disadvantage of this method is that the mass activities are less than those of the village cadres. The First District overcame this shortcoming and launched a "removing the traitor's hat" movement, "removing the hat" for the puppet soldiers, and "washing the face" for the lackeys. After prior deliberation by the masses, their shortcomings were found, and they were asked to confess at a general meeting. After approval by the mass group meeting, it would not count if one group did not pass it. Experience has shown that those who have been "de-hatted" have performed very well, and some have even turned in buried firearms. However, the deliberation must be mature, and the group discussion must be implemented, otherwise, if the hat is removed immediately, it will still not reduce their ferocity, and they will still help the landlords do evil, and the goal of completely destroying the landlords' rule cannot be achieved.

　　In order to more effectively isolate the stubborn landlords, the First District launched a movement for stubborn landlords to sign guarantees. At a mass meeting, the landlords stated that they would never "counterattack." After discussion by everyone, the whole family pressed their fingerprints on the spot and signed a written statement. Finally, the masses proposed: If they lived honestly, they would never be struggled against again, in order to stabilize their emotions. The Sixth District launched a citizen review movement, also reviewing everyone's civil rights through mass group meetings. As a result, honest landlords who had been struggled against were also given civil rights, leaving only a few major traitors and bullies. For example, in Xuzhuang, initially eleven people had no civil rights, but after another review, only three remained. These people without civil rights were monitored by everyone, had no freedom to go out, and had to report even if relatives came to visit. In fact, this won over the small and medium landlords and isolated the stubborn elements. It is a pity that these two methods were not combined. If a guarantee movement had been carried out for those without civil rights after the citizen review, the effect would have been greater. (Jinan Branch)

　　恩夏土地改革经验之二
    争取一切可争取的人
    东宁
    在群众运动中，有些人被地主收买，成了地主的爪牙，这些人大部是基本群众，又是地主统治群众的“傀儡”。群众对他们很痛恨，但往往不了解他们也是为穷所迫。因此，领导上应掌握少斗，或以斗争来争取团结的精神。五区小李官屯、牟王庄的农会主任，六区门王庄的村长，都是经过斗争又团结争取过来的。
    争取这些人的两个环节：一是使他们在群众中有一个短时期的孤立，以减其威风；另外必须分给果实，以达到真正的团结。六区经群众讨论，普遍给他们以入农会的“候补期”，先交给他一半果实，余一半等他变好了，或其干伪匪的子弟回来再给。村干部并不断与其谈话，以达到改造的目的。这办法的缺点是群众活动比村干少，一区克服了这一缺点，展开一个“摘汉奸帽”运动，对伪匪“摘帽”，对狗腿“洗脸”。事先经群众酝酿，找到他的毛病，开大会由他坦白，经群众小组会批准，有一个小组通不过也不算摘掉。经验证明：凡经过“摘帽”的，表现都很好，有人把埋藏的枪支也缴出来。但酝酿必须成熟，小组讨论要贯彻，不然马上摘了帽仍不能减其凶焰，仍会帮助地主为非作歹，而不能达成彻底摧垮地主统治的目的。
    为了更有效的孤立顽固地主，在一区展开了顽固地主具结运动，在群众会上，由地主表明永不“反攻”，再经大家讨论后，当场全家按手印，立字据，最后由群众提出：如老老实实过日子，决不再斗，以安定他的情绪。六区则展开一个公民审查运动，也是经群众小组会审查每个人的公民权，结果凡被斗后的老实地主也给了公民权，留下的只是个别的大汉奸大恶霸了。如徐庄开始十一个人无公民权，以后经再次审查，只剩三人，这些无公民权的，大家监视他，无出门自由，有亲家来也要报告。这样事实上就争取了中小地主而孤立了顽固分子。可惜这两种办法未结合采用，如先经过公民审查，对无公民权的来一个具结运动，收效当然会更大。（冀南分社）
