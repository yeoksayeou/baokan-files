　　Commend the Meritorious Servants of the People and Promote New Heroism
    Heroic Gathering of the Junan Campaign
  　Freely Discussing Model Deeds and Exchanging Combat Experience
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] On October 5th, the First Brigade of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region held a victory celebration for heroes of the Junan Campaign at its station. The venue was filled with colorful slogans and cartoons. Over two hundred heroes and model workers attended. An old villager pointed at a cartoon depicting retreating Kuomintang soldiers and said, "Comrades! Kill these Chiang Kai-shek pups, don't let them harm people anymore!" After the meeting began, Director Yao said: "Today's meeting is for everyone to speak, leaders to listen, models to speak, and comrades to listen, to widely disseminate and exchange your experiences and model deeds, and prepare for everyone to learn, so that we can kill and wound even more enemies next time..." Deputy Political Commissar Cui emphasized: "Cherish these experiences, spread these experiences." Then they broke into groups for discussions, and the heroes spoke endlessly about their experiences. Han Wensheng, a soldier from the Second Squad of the Ninth Company, was seventeen years old. When attacking Dongfuchun, he grappled with a Kuomintang soldier, seized a gun, and when another enemy offered him his backpack, he said, "I don't want it, quickly surrender your gun." He captured four or five rifles in total. Comrade Yan Erwa was liberated from the Ping-Han Campaign last year. On the battlefield, he strictly adhered to the policy on prisoners of war and persuaded dozens of enemies to lay down their weapons. He said, "We are the Eighth Route Army, we only want weapons on the battlefield, we never search the prisoners' pockets." He also captured many machine guns, rifles, and ammunition. Comrade Yu Jingxin said: "Our squad leader was wounded, and ordered me to obey the command of the third squad leader. Right! However he told me to move, I moved, if he told me to charge, I charged." Endless bravery, countless heroes, continued for three hours. At this time, amidst the deafening sound of gongs and drums, cadres from the × District led representatives of the masses to present flowers to the heroes. He said: "You have victoriously defended the people, your elders and siblings should care about you!" "To your families, rest assured, we will definitely take care of them, so you can confidently fight more beautiful battles!" The earth-shattering shouts resounded: "Resolutely fight on!" The warriors toasted, and glorious red flowers were pinned on the chests of the heroes.
