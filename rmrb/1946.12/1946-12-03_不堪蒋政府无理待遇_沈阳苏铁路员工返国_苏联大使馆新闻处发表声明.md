Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. The Soviet side has withdrawn the Soviet employees of the China Changchun Railway in Shenyang and they have returned home. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing: The press office of the Soviet Embassy in China issued a statement on the 28th stating: "In fact, the employees in that area are unable to perform their duties. Over the past few months, the Chinese authorities (referring to the Chiang government) have made it impossible for these employees to perform their duties or even reside in Shenyang, creating an intolerable situation. The Embassy has ample material to prove that not only have the local civil and military authorities failed to provide appropriate protection to the Soviet railway employees, but on the contrary, many Soviet employees have become victims of beatings and other illegal acts. Chinese troops (referring to Chiang's troops) have even participated in these acts. A considerable number of Soviet employees are experiencing extremely difficult material conditions because private property has been taken away by local officials or looted by Chinese troops (referring to Chiang's troops)." The statement also refutes the Central News Agency's distorted reports that the withdrawal of these railway employees was due to illness and poverty, and denies the Central News Agency's claim that there are still 200 Soviet employees remaining in Shenyang. (Note: Recent reports from the Central News Agency stated that those being recalled to the Soviet Union were some of the Soviet employees in Shenyang who were ill, experiencing difficult living conditions, and had less work.)

　　不堪蒋政府无理待遇
  　沈阳苏铁路员工返国
  　苏联大使馆新闻处发表声明
    【新华社延安三十日电】苏方已撤退沈阳中长路苏联员工返国。据路透社南京讯：苏联驻华大使馆新闻处二十八日发表声明称：“事实上该地员工等无法在其职务上实施其职务，过去数月来，中国当局（指蒋政府）使这些员工不能执行职务甚至居留沈阳均处于无可忍受的情况。大使馆有很多材料足以证明不仅地方民政及军事当局未予苏联铁路员工以适当的保护，反之，许多苏联员工成为殴打及其他非法行为的牺牲者。而此种行为竟有中国军队（指蒋军）参加。有相当一部分苏联员工物质条件甚为困难，因为私人财产已被地方官员取去，或被中国军队（指蒋军）人员所劫掠。”该声明并驳斥中央社歪曲报导该铁路员工等之撤退系由于患病及贫穷，并否认中央社所传尚有二百苏联职工留在沈阳之说。（按中央社近报导调回苏联者系在沈阳患病生活困难与工作较少之部分苏联员工。）
