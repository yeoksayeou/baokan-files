　　The Teacher of the Weaving Women
    Li Old Lady
    Wu Yinglin
    The weavers in Shaogu District of Wei County all like to say, "Weaving floral cloth and towels, it all started with Old Lady Li." People cherish her as they cherish their own machines.

    Old Lady Li is fifty years old, but still very strong. Every day she accompanies the machines, weaving herself and teaching others to weave. She has personally trained a hundred teachers, and now the entire district has three thousand looms. She was originally the wife of Yuan Jinchao, but unexpectedly, Yuan died in middle age, so she remarried Yuan Jinlan, and often received Jinlan's contempt and abuse, feeling that there was no way out. Under Yuan Jinlan's various abuses, she spent a long and difficult time, and in this situation, she learned skillful weaving techniques. With the land reform movement, women were liberated, and Old Lady Li was liberated. From then on, she promoted her methods of weaving floral cloth and towels. She said, "I want everyone to have food to eat and work to do." In addition to actively weaving herself, she also encouraged other women to weave.

    Now Old Lady Li has three new houses, savings of 100,000 yuan, and ten bags of grain. When the reporter interviewed her, she happily said, "Without the Communist Party, I wouldn't have the good life I have today. If Old Jiang wants to invade southern Hebei, I will risk my old life to fight." She also said that she is willing to work hard with the 30,000 weavers in Shaogu District of Wei County to produce and defend Chairman Mao, and defend our good life.

　　纺妇们的老师
    李老太太
    武英林
    威县邵固区的织民们都爱这样说：“织花布织毛巾，都是李老太太兴的头。”人们爱护她，像爱护自己的机器一样。
    李老太太五十岁了，但仍很健壮，每天伴随着机器，自己织，教别人织，她亲手培养了百十个老师，现全区拥有织机三千架。她原是元金朝的老婆，不料元中年丧命，便改嫁于元金兰，常常受到金兰的白眼辱骂，感到没有出路。在元金兰的百般虐待下，渡过了很长的艰难日子，就在这种情况下，她学会了纯熟的纺织技艺，随着土地改革运动，妇女翻了身，李老太太才得到了解放。从此她便推广她织花布和毛巾的方法。她说：“我愿大家都有饭吃，都有活做。”她除个人积极纺织外，还推动其他的妇女纺织。
    现在李老太太有新房三间，积蓄十万元，十布袋粮食。当记者访问她时，她高兴的说：“没有共产党，就没有我今天的好日子。假若老蒋要进犯冀南，我拚上老命也得干”。她并说她愿和威县邵固区三万织民们，共同努力生产，保卫毛主席，保卫好日子。
