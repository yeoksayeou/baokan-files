　　Deeply Mobilizing Backward Peasants to Speak Out in Shangbailin
    Carrying Out Anti-Special Agent Struggle During Checking Reduction
    People Who Never Said a Word Before All Rose Up to Speak Out
    The Conspiracy of the Special Agents Was Finally Completely Smashed
    Pouring Out Years of Bitterness
    Unprecedented Unity of Peasants
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In Wu'an Seventh District, Shangbailin Village, during the movement to check land and reduce rents, deeply mobilized backward peasants to speak out about their grievances, giving the landlord bullies and special agents an even more forceful blow politically, completely isolating them. Before this checking reduction, although the village had undergone several years of mass movement, and the masses had been considerably mobilized, and the landlords had been greatly weakened, there were still many backward peasants bound by ideas of "changing heaven" and fate, who had not fully expressed their grievances, nor had they truly turned themselves around. Of the village's two hundred-plus households, thirty-five had an average of just over one mu of land per person, and sixty-two had no housing. Landlord bullies headed by Guo Liantang, however, in addition to retaining a considerable amount of land (such as the Wang Zhongtang family, which had an average of twelve mu of land per person), further exploited the backward elements among the peasants. After the tense situation in northern Henan in July, they restored special agent organizations such as the "Common Progress Society" and "Family Rituals," extensively spreading propaganda about "changing heaven," seizing upon certain shortcomings in our work, such as the past struggle targets not being clear, middle peasants and turned-over peasants fearing struggle against themselves; formalism existing in mutual aid teams, and some peasants not having turned themselves around, etc. They deceived some people into joining, actively sabotaging our participation in the war, military service, voluntary transport, and mutual aid cooperation, etc.

    At the beginning of the checking reduction last month, the District Committee conducted an in-depth investigation, studied these situations, and resolved to carry out three tasks during the checking reduction: (1) Mobilize the backward elements to speak out about their grievances and settle accounts with the landlord bullies. (2) Combine speaking out and settling accounts to expose the crimes of the special agents and eliminate them. (3) Leveling up and making up the difference.

    In order to break the masses' mentality of fearing "a wasted struggle that cannot turn them around," the village cadres were first organized to reflect on their actions, clarifying that the cadres' responsibility was to lead the masses' struggle so that everyone could completely turn themselves around. Then, at a general meeting, they guaranteed to the masses that they would no longer want the fruits, and that all the returns from the settlement would be distributed to the poor peasants.

    Secondly, the masses were organized to discuss and deliberate: Who oppressed us and exploited us in the past, why haven't we turned ourselves around, and how can we turn ourselves around. Cadres and activists went deep among the masses, guiding them to talk to each other, to talk about their past lives and sufferings, and naturally they talked about the many grievances of being oppressed and exploited by landlords Guo Liantang, Li Zhe, Wang Zhongtang, Zhu Guinan, etc. Guo Liwang recounted that his brother had worked at Wang Zhongtang's brick kiln, was forced to work close to the kiln opening and burned to death, but not only did they not provide compensation or a coffin, but they also scolded his brother for "not being material." He cried and said: "It's been twenty or thirty years, I don't know if I can still talk about it?" The masses angrily replied in unison: "Yes!" The wife of poor peasant Fu Dan was seduced by Guo Liantang's wife to mess around with Hu of the Central Army, forcing Fu Dan to finally hang himself, and this was also angrily accused by the masses. Guo Jingyu recounted that he used to run a small restaurant, and Guo Liantang took counterfeit tickets and insisted that he had found them, and sent him to the Central Army to be hanged and beaten several times, and finally he was forced to pay money and entertain guests, and the small restaurant could no longer be run. He said: "If I can avenge this, I would be happy to die!" Dozens of other crimes that had never been mentioned before, such as being hanged and extorted by Guo Liantang in collusion with the Central Army, being forced to pay rent and loans and running away in famine years, and landlords relying on the "Central Army" to shift burdens and corvée labor, were all accused by many backward peasants who had never spoken before in their indignation. Those who used to be afraid of "changing heaven" were no longer afraid when they saw the large crowds. At the meeting to struggle against Guo Liantang on the 7th and 8th of last month, almost all those who spoke out about their grievances were people who had never spoken before. They shouted that Guo Liantang should compensate for the losses.

    After the struggle, the leadership further guided the masses to discuss the recent sabotage activities of Guo Liantang and others, making it clear to everyone that the purpose of their activities was to seize the fruits of the peasants' turning over, and to suck the peasants' blood and sweat again. By mid-last month, when the deliberation was relatively mature, an anti-special agent meeting was held. The crimes of Guo Liantang, using his own wife to collude with bachelor Guo Weixiang (head of the fourth neighborhood) to disintegrate the mutual aid team of the fourth neighborhood, deliberately leaving the land of the family members of soldiers participating in the war and resisting the war uncultivated in order to sabotage participation in the war and military service; instigating Guo Zhenjiang's wife, a family member of a soldier resisting the war, to borrow more than thirty kilograms of cotton from the cooperative and sell it for money to eat (saying that they would not have to pay it back once the Central Army came), in order to sabotage the cooperative; deliberately making noise and creating dissatisfaction during the mass movement, and colluding with special agent Song Binglin, who was sent from outside, in an attempt to poison the textile hero Guo Heng and the village and district cadres, etc., were thoroughly exposed. The masses deepened their hatred for the landlord bullies during the anti-special agent campaign.

    Those who had been fooled, such as Li Youcai, were guided to win them over through education, to confess thoroughly, and to not pursue the past at all. In this way, the special agent landlords were completely isolated, and the masses showed unprecedented unity.

    At the beginning of this month, the masses continued to carry out the liquidation struggle, thoroughly liquidating and exposing all the crimes of more than ten landlord bullies and special agents such as Wang Zhongtang, Li Zhe, and Zhu Guinan. All the former backward peasants poured out their years of grievances, showing an unprecedented consistency in their thinking and feelings with the advanced peasants. In the pursuit of land, houses, grain, and money from the villainous bullies and landlords, the former backward peasants all stepped to the front. Wen Shunian never said a word in the past, but now he takes off his clothes, sticks out his chest, and demonstrates as soon as he goes to the landlord's house or enters the meeting place, showing unprecedented courage. He said: "I want to overthrow feudalism!" Now they are conducting a detailed leveling-up and making-up with the land and houses that have been liquidated. (East)

### 上柏林深入发动落后农民诉苦  查减中开展反特斗争

　　上柏林深入发动落后农民诉苦
    查减中开展反特斗争
    从不吭气的人都奋起诉苦
    特务的阴谋终于全部粉碎
    倒尽多年苦水
    农民空前团结
    【本报特讯】武安七区上柏林村在查减运动中，深入发动落后层农民诉苦申冤，使奸霸特务地主在政治上受到更有力的打击，完全陷于孤立。此次查减以前，该村虽经过数年群运，群众有了相当发动，地主也受到很大削弱，但仍有好些落后农民受变天思想与命运观念束缚，没有把冤苦诉尽，也没有翻身。全村二百多户中，有三十五户每人只平均一亩多地，有六十二户没房住。以郭连堂为首的地主恶霸们则除保有相当多的土地（如王忠堂家每人平均有地十二亩）外，更利用农民中的落后层，于七月份豫北形势紧张后，恢复“共进会”、“在家礼”等特务组织，大肆宣传变天，抓住我工作中某些缺点，如过去斗争对象不明确，中农与翻身农民怕斗争自己；互助组存在着形式主义，部分农民没翻身等，骗得一部分人上钩，积极破坏我参战参军，义运与互助合作等。
    上月发动查减之初，该区分委深入调查，研究了这些情况，决心在查减中进行三件工作：（一）发动落后层申冤诉苦，向地主恶霸拉破脸算账。（二）结合诉苦清算，揭发特务罪恶，肃清特务。（三）填平补齐。
    为打破群众怕“白斗一场、翻不了身”的心理，首先组织村干部反省，明确了干部的责任是领导群众斗争，使大家都彻底翻身。然后在大会上向群众保证自己不再要果实，清算回来一律分给贫苦农民。
    其次就组织群众酝酿讨论：过去谁压迫过咱，剥削过咱，为啥咱没翻身，怎样才能翻身。干部积极分子深入到群众中，引导群众互相谈心，谈过去的生活与痛苦，很自然的就谈到地主郭连堂、李哲、王忠堂、朱桂南，等过去压迫剥削自己的许多冤事。郭立旺诉说他哥哥在王忠堂家砖窑上做工，被迫接近窑口而烧死，人家不仅不抚恤，不给棺材，还骂哥哥“没材料”，他哭着说：“二、三十年的事了，不知道还能说不能？”群众愤激的齐答：“能！”贫民福旦的女人被郭连堂女人勾去与中央军胡搞，逼得福旦最后吊死，也被愤激的群众控诉出来。郭景玉诉说他以前开一小饭铺，郭连堂拿假票硬说是他找的，抓送到中央军里吊打几次，最后被迫包了钱、请了客，小铺也不能干了。他说：“要能报了这仇，死也痛快！”许多过去被郭连堂勾结中央军吊打讹诈过的，灾荒年被逼租逼款逼跑的，因欠地主几元洋钱弄得倾家荡产的，以及地主们倚仗“中央军”，转嫁负担与差役等，好几十条过去没提到过的罪恶，都在激愤中被许多从来不吭气的落后农民控诉出来。以前怕变天的，看见人多势众，都不怕了。上月七、八号斗争郭连堂的大会上，诉苦申冤的几乎全是以前没说过话的人。他们高喊着要叫郭连堂包赔损失。
    斗争后领导上进一步引导群众谈论最近时期郭连堂等的特务破坏活动，使大家明确了他们这种活动的目的，是要夺取农民翻身果实，重吸农民血汗。到上月中旬酝酿较为成熟时，即召开反特务大会。把郭连堂以自己女人勾结光棍汉郭维祥（四闾闾长），来瓦解四闾互助组，故意把参战民兵与抗属的地代耕荒了，以破坏参战参军；唆使抗属郭振江女人到合作社贷三十多斤棉花卖钱吃掉（说是中央一来就不用还了），以破坏合作社；群运中故意嚷闹，制造不满，与外面派来特务宋丙林合谋，企图毒死纺织英雄郭恒的与村区干部等罪恶，做了彻底揭发。群众在反特中更加深了对恶霸地主的憎恨。
    上当分子李有才等，则引导群众争取教育他们彻底坦白，完全不究既往。这样，特务地主完全被孤立，群众表现了空前的团结。
    本月初，群众继续开展清算斗争，将王忠堂、李哲、朱桂南等十来户恶霸特务地主前前后后的罪恶全部作了清算与揭发，所有从前的落后农民，每个人都把自己多年的冤苦倒了出来，与先进农民在思想感情上表现了空前的一致。在向奸霸地主们追讨应赔退之土地房产粮款中，从前的落后农民都走到前面。温书年过去从来不吭气，现在是一上地主家，一进会场就脱了衣服，挺胸示威，显出从来未有的勇敢。他说：“我要打倒封建！”现在他们正以清算出来的土地房产细密进行填平补齐。（东）
