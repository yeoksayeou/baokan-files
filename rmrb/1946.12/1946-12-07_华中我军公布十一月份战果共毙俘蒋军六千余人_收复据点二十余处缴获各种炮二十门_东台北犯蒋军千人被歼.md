Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th: The New Fourth Army Central China Field Army Headquarters recently released a November self-defense war communique as follows: 34 battles of varying sizes; the removal of more than 20 strong and fortified strongholds such as Songji, Qingong, Shitang, Cheqiao, Jingkou, Shunheji, Liuqiao, Choujiaqiao, Libao, and Jiaoxie; and the recovery of a large area sixty li east of Huai'an and thirty li south of the Yu-Huang River. Over 6,000 Chiang troops were killed, wounded, or captured; 10 American-made 60mm mortars, 10 various caliber mortars, over ten light and heavy machine guns, 798 various rifles and carbines, over 2,400 various caliber artillery shells, and 100,000 rounds of various bullets were seized. One "B24" bomber and one "P51" fighter plane were shot down, and two armored speedboats were sunk.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th: The New Fourth Army on the southern front of Jiangsu and Anhui, since the 26th of last month, has annihilated 1,000 men of the 83rd and 67th Divisions of the Chiang army who invaded Yancheng from East Tai in five days and nights. After completing the task of annihilating the enemy's active forces, the New Fourth Army actively withdrew from Dingxi (16 li northeast of East Tai) and Caoyan (20 li northeast of East Tai) on the night of the 30th of last month, and transferred to a new position to resist. Currently, the Chiang army is concentrating its 67th and 65th Divisions, etc., in Dongtai to strengthen its invading forces, but the Libao, Jiaoxie, and ＠cha line east of Hai'an, controlled by a regiment of its 67th Division, has been recovered by a unit of the New Fourth Army, which shows that the Chiang army lacks sufficient troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd: Hu Chengqian, a major battalion commander, and Tan Yanhong, a captain and deputy battalion commander, of the First Battalion, 512th Regiment, 177th Division, 7th Army of the Guixi [Guangxi Clique] Chiang Army, who laid down their weapons in Songji, northwest of Huaiyin, on the evening of the 22nd of last month, bitterly recounted how Chiang Kai-shek eliminated dissidents and weakened the Guixi army. They claimed that at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the Guixi army had two army groups, the 11th and 12th, totaling 400,000 men. During the Anti-Japanese War, they were repeatedly reorganized and reduced by Chiang Kai-shek, and now only the 7th and 48th armies remain, totaling about 40,000 to 50,000 men. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they surrendered in Bengbu, Anhui, and all the weapons they obtained were taken away by Chiang Kai-shek's Military Affairs Commission. When Hu spoke about the Guixi soldiers' war-weariness and desertion, he said: In May, when they were stationed in Chuxian, a training captain led all the team members and surplus officers, fifty or sixty people, to desert collectively. During the Songji battle, more than 400 soldiers from Hu's battalion scattered and fled after destroying their fortifications.

　　华中我军公布十一月份战果共毙俘蒋军六千余人
  　收复据点二十余处缴获各种炮二十门
  　东台北犯蒋军千人被歼
    【新华社华中四日电】新四军华中野战军司令部顷发布十一月份自卫战公报如下：大小战斗三十四次，拔除宋集、钦工、石塘、车桥、径口、顺河集、刘桥、仇家桥、李堡、角斜等二十余强固据点，及收复淮安以东淤黄河以南六十里横三十里之大块地区。毙伤俘蒋军六千余人，缴护美制六零小炮十门，各种口径迫击炮十门，轻重机枪十余挺、各式长短枪七百九十八支，各式口径炮弹二千四百余发，各种子弹十万发。击毁“Ｂ２４”型轰炸机及“Ｐ５１”型战斗机各一架，击沉装甲汽艇两艘。
    【新华社华中四日电】苏皖南线新四军，自上月二十六日起，五昼夜间共歼灭由东台北犯盐城之蒋军八十三师及六十七师所部一千人。在完成歼敌有生力量目的后，新四军已于上月三十日夜主动撤出丁溪（东台北十六里）及草堰（东台北二十里），转移新阵地抗击。现蒋军正将其六十七及六十五师等部集结东台，以加强北犯兵力，但其六十七师一个团所控制的海安以东李堡、角斜、＠茶一线，已为新四军某部收复，由此可见蒋军兵力不足。
    【新华社华中三日电】上月二十二日晚，于淮阴西北宋集放下武器之桂系蒋军第七军一七七师五一二团一营少校营长胡承乾及上尉副营长谭彦鸿二氏，痛述蒋介石排除异已削弱桂军，据称，抗战初期桂军有第十一及第十二两个集团军，共四十万人，在抗战中屡被蒋介石改编缩编，现仅剩有第七及第四十八两个军，约四五万人。抗战胜利后，在安徽蚌埠受降，所得武器又全被蒋介石之军委会收去。胡氏于谈及桂系士兵厌战逃亡时称：五月间，当其驻守滁县时，有一教导队长率领全体队员与编余军官五六十人集体逃跑，此次宋集战斗中胡营四百余士兵于毁坏工事后，即四散逃跑。
