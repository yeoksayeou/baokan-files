Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: A dispatch from Beiping on the 14th reports: Since the signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, American goods have been flooding into China in even greater quantities. According to aggregated news reports: of the 87 American ships recently sailing from America to China, fully loaded with goods, 20 have already arrived at Wusong Port on the 11th. Another 600 American ships are expected to arrive in China successively within the year, each carrying an average of 8,000 tons of cargo. Due to the large-scale dumping of American goods in China, Shanghai alone has concentrated circulating capital of 120 billion to compete for the purchase of American goods. Consequently, remittance rates from Beiping and Tianjin to Shanghai have soared to 700,000 yuan per 10 million yuan. The black market exchange rate for US dollars is also rising daily, increasing from over 4,700 yuan to 6,000 yuan in Beiping in the week leading up to the 13th. It is reported that the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai are extremely panicked and anxious, and many will inevitably close down at the end of the year. Due to the recent dumping of American nylon stockings, more than a dozen Shanghai knitting factories, including China Felt Company, have formally announced their closure. Knitting factories that are still operating are in a state of near-bankruptcy, working only two or three hours a day, or operating for three days and then stopping for two days. It is generally predicted that the 1,500 large and small factories in Tianjin will also have difficulty surviving the end of the year, and many will likely close down at the end of the year.

　　不尽美货滚滚来华
    津沪工业难渡年关
    【新华社延安十八日电】北平十四日电：自蒋美商约签订后，美货更加大量倾入中国。综合各报消息：最近由美驶华满载货物之美轮八十七艘，已有二十艘于十一日抵达吴淞口。另有美轮六百艘，将于年内陆续驶华，每艘平均装货达八千吨之巨，由于美货大量倾销中国，上海一地，集中流资达一千二百亿竞购美货。而自平、津至上海汇水高达每千万元需洋七十万。美金黑市亦一日三涨，北平一周来迄十三日止，美金已由四千七百余元涨至六千元。据闻现沪市工商界恐慌焦急万分，年关时难免整批关门，因为近日美玻璃袜的倾销，上海针织厂中国毡记等十余家，已正式宣告停业。而目前尚在开工的针织厂均陷入每日开工二三小时，或开三日停二日的破产现象。一般预料天津方面一千五百余家大小工厂，亦难渡过年关，年终时恐也有不少要关门。
