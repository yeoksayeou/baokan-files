    Taihang No. 2 Middle School Correspondents
    Spinning Wool and Knitting Vests

    [This newspaper's Changzhi News] Taihang No. 2 Middle School is actively engaged in production. Four correspondents produced finished products worth more than five thousand yuan in half a month and were praised by the school. Principal Su called on all students to learn from them. The school prepared twenty spinning wheels to organize wool spinning. The correspondents responded to the call and decided that each of the four people should wear a woolen sweater. The four people bought a total of eight catties of wool. At first, they used a "ba diaozi" (不知道如何翻译) to pluck it, and could only produce half an ounce of yarn per day. Later, Comrade Wang Zengming borrowed a spinning wheel from the General Affairs Section to learn to spin, and achieved great results. Everyone came to learn. Some spun, some knitted. As a result, in less than eleven days, they turned eight catties of wool into yarn, and knitted three woolen vests. The more they worked, the more skilled they became, and the results doubled. Correspondent Mao Tong also proposed a challenge competition with the students.

　　太行二中通讯员
    纺毛织背心
    【本报长治讯】太行二中正积极进行生产，四个通讯员半个月生产成品价值五千余元，受到校方表扬，苏校长号召全校同学向他们学习。学校为组织纺毛线，准备了纺车二十架。通讯员响应号召，决定四个人每人要穿身毛衣。四个人一共买了八斤羊毛，先是用拔吊子拔，每天只能出半两线，后来王增明同志才到总务科借上纺车学纺，成绩很大，大家都来学，纺的纺，打的打，结果不到十一天，就把八斤羊毛变成了线，而且打成了三个毛背心。越闹越熟练，成绩倍增。通讯员茂同并提出与同学们挑战竞赛。（芝文）
