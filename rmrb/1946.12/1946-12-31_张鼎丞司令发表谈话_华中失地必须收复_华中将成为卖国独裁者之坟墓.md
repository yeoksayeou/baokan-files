　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 29th: Commander Zhang Dingcheng of the Central China Military Region recently issued a statement on the situation of the self-defense war in Central China, reiterating the determination to recover the lost territory in the Central China Liberated Area. Commander Zhang stated: As long as Chiang Kai-shek has a shred of strength to use, he will bring it to the Central China battlefield. When the Central China battlefield has been fought to the point where Chiang Kai-shek can no longer fight, then he will inevitably have been unable to fight on other battlefields long ago. Central China will be the most frequent and severe battlefield in the patriotic self-defense war, and also the battlefield with decisive significance in finally defeating Chiang Kai-shek. Central China will become the graveyard of traitorous dictators. Commander Zhang pointed out: Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to resolve the Central China battlefield will inevitably fail. This is due to: First, the strength of Chiang's army is limited. In central Jiangsu alone (excluding northern Jiangsu, Huainan, and Huaibei), thirteen brigades have already been annihilated. In Huaibei, the 11th Division's three brigades were recently transferred from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front, but in the recent Battle of Su-Shu, three and a half brigades were annihilated. Second, if Chiang Kai-shek draws troops from other battlefields, it will inevitably create conditions on other battlefields that are more favorable for our counter-offensive. Third, the more concentrated his forces are, the easier it will be to carry out guerrilla warfare in the Chiang-occupied areas. Every time he occupies an empty city, we can recover a large piece of our homeland. Commander Zhang finally emphasized: Central China must persevere, and it will definitely be able to persevere.

　　张鼎丞司令发表谈话
    华中失地必须收复
    华中将成为卖国独裁者之坟墓
    【新华社华中二十九日电】华中军区张司令鼎丞，顷就华中自卫战形势发表谈话，重申华中解放区失地必复的决心。张司令称：只要蒋介石还有一分力量能使用，它都会拿到华中战场上来的，华中战场打到蒋介石不能再打时，则它对其他各战场就必然早已不能再打了。华中将是爱国自卫战中战斗最频繁最严重的战场，也是最后击败蒋介石具有决定意义的战场。华中将成为卖国独裁者之坟墓。张司令指出：蒋介石要解决华中战场必然失败，这由于：第一、蒋军的兵力有限，仅在苏中（不包括苏北及淮南、淮北）早已被歼灭十三个旅；在淮北，新近由冀鲁豫前线调来了整十一师三个旅，但此次宿沭一战，却被歼灭了三个半旅。第二、蒋介石如从其他战场抽调兵力，就必然造成其他战场更利于我的反攻条件。第三、他的兵力愈集中，蒋占区的游击战就更易开展，它每侵占一座空城，我们即可恢复一大块乡土。张司令最后强调指出：华中必须坚持，也一定能够坚持的。
