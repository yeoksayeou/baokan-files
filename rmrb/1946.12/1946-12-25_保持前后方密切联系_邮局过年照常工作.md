　　Maintain Close Contact Between the Front and Rear
    Post Offices Work as Usual During the New Year
    [Our Newspaper] In order to rapidly forward books, newspapers, and letters from various locations to the front lines and maintain close contact between the front and rear, the Border Region Postal Service Bureau recently issued a circular to all local bureaus and stations, stating that there would be no holidays during both the New Year and the Lunar New Year, and work would continue as usual. After receiving the Border Region Government's notice regarding the New Year's Day (Gregorian calendar) holiday, all postal workers immediately stated: "Although the Border Government has announced a holiday, we will continue to work as usual, setting a good example for all local bureaus and stations."
