    Plot to Rob Bank and Seize Machine Guns
    Chiang Kai-shek's Special Agent Wang Jinquan Executed by Firing Squad
    [Our newspaper, Wei County, 11th dispatch] In order to coordinate with its military offensive, the Kuomintang has widely dispersed special agents in villages and towns along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to carry out assassinations, robberies, and sabotage activities. Wang Jinquan of Fucheng, under the instructions of Fan Zhenhe, a Kuomintang special agent leader in Tianjin, colluded with reactionary landlords Wang Juru and Shi Yuren, and hooligans Li Xiqin, Wang Junzhang, Wu Bingsen, Liu Fuyi and other saboteurs in the Fucheng and Jiaohe areas to organize an "assassination squad." They plotted to rob our individual dispatched personnel of their firearms in the outskirts of Fucheng. That night, their plot was thwarted due to rain and our vigilance. This traitor had previously bought off hooligans and local bullies to rob a shop in Xindian, Jiaohe, of 200,000 yuan in legal tender and 13,000 yuan in Jicha banknotes, and beat the shopkeeper three times. Not long after, Wang Jinquan carried the large sum of money to Tianjin to contact Fan Zhenhe. Upon returning on October 15th, he colluded with an insider at the repair shop in Xianjiao County (newly established county), preparing to use a grenade explosion as a signal at night to rob the Fudong branch of the Jinan Bank and the machine guns of the Military Affairs Committee. After this conspiracy was discovered by the masses and the Public Security Bureau, before they could act, they gathered militiamen and arrested all the criminals in one fell swoop, seizing a pistol and a broken pistol. With irrefutable evidence, Wang Jinquan could not deny it and was immediately handed over to the masses for public trial and execution by firing squad. The other misguided followers, after confessing and repenting to the masses, have been released.
