　　UNRRA Taiyuan Office
    Illegally Deducts My Relief Supplies
    [This newspaper reports] The UNRRA Taiyuan office, on the one hand, allows Yan Xishan to fraudulently obtain relief supplies to support the civil war; on the other hand, it discriminates against the Liberated Areas in various ways, resulting in unfair distribution. According to the Taiyuan office's statistics on November 15th, 27,550 large bags of flour had been distributed to the Yan-controlled areas, and 307 large bags to the Liberated Areas, only about one percent of the amount given to the Yan-controlled areas. Furthermore, 77,592 small bags were distributed to the Yan-controlled areas, and 2,307 small bags to the Liberated Areas, less than three percent of the amount given to the Yan-controlled areas. Even this small amount, the Liberated Areas did not receive in full. For example, the quantity of relief supplies allocated to our Changzhi area was: according to the Taiyuan office's statistics on November 15th, it was 221 small bags of flour, 5,384 cases of milk, 148 barrels of milk powder, 1,000 packages of old clothes, 500 packages of old shoes, and 80 boxes of medicine. However, the actual amount received by our area was: 196 small bags of flour, 5,216 cases of milk, 148 barrels of milk powder, 848 packages of old clothes, 489 packages of old shoes, and 52 boxes of medicine. The office should be fully responsible for the whereabouts of these missing supplies.

　　行总太原分署
    无理扣我救济物资
    【本报讯】行总太原分署，一方面容许阎锡山骗取救济物资，支持内战；另方面对解放区多方歧视，分配不公。据太原分署十一月十五日统计，面粉已分配给阎管区二七、五五○大袋，解放区三○七大袋，仅及阎管区的百分之一。又分配给阎管区七七、五九二小袋，解放区二、三○七小袋，不及阎管区的百分之三。即此微小数量，解放区亦未如数收到，例如分配给我长治地区救济物资数量：太原分署十一月十五日统计是面粉二二一小袋，牛奶五、三八四箱，奶粉一四八桶，旧衣一、○○○包，旧鞋五○○包，医药品八○箱。而我区实际收到的却是：面粉一九六小袋，牛奶五、二一六箱，奶粉一四八桶，旧衣八四八包，旧鞋四八九包，医药品五二箱。此种少收物资究竟下落如何，该署应负完全责任。
