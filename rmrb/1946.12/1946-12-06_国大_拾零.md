　　"National Assembly" Preparations Cost Over 10 Billion
　　According to official announcements, the preparatory expenses for this "National Assembly" were 10 billion yuan, but in reality, it far exceeded this. Even taking 10 billion as the figure, if used to relieve famine victims, it could feed 500,000 people for a month; if used for education, it could accommodate all the out-of-school children in Nanjing. A reporter from a private newspaper in Shanghai visited Zhang Jiaxuan on Tianzhu Road on the 18th but did not find him. Zhang's gatekeeper told the reporter about the "National Assembly," saying, "What good does holding the National Assembly do for the common people? It would be more practical to give this money to the people."
  　
　　American-Style Military Police Guarding, People Frequently Disturbed
　　The National Assembly Hall was surrounded by fully American-equipped military police, with extremely strict security. Wherever the representatives went, police were densely deployed. All cars and other means of transportation were prohibited from passing on Guofu Road, except for the cars delivering banquets from large restaurants (these large restaurants were all booked to entertain the "representatives"). Before the opening of the "National Assembly," a major household census was conducted three times in the nearby streets. After the meeting, many common people were still subjected to unexpected disturbances, and the loud reprimands of the military police became commonplace.
  　
　　Newspaper Vendors Shout Themselves Hoarse, No One Buys Extras
　　When the news of the "National Assembly" opening reached Chongqing, the official newspapers, as usual, issued extras in the evening. The newspaper vendors shouted themselves hoarse on the streets, but no one looked, and no one bought them. This was completely different from the enthusiastic rush to buy extras just after the "victory."
  　
　　Youth Party Suddenly Seems Affluent, Clothing Stores Overwhelmed
　　After the Youth Party "representatives" arrived in Nanjing, they suddenly seemed affluent. Men and women rushed to have new clothes made, overwhelming the clothing stores. At the same time, the Youth Party's office was guarded by Chiang Kai-shek's military police. On the 21st, when Hong Lanyou reported the list of presidium candidates, he omitted a Youth Party "representative," which alarmed Lei Zhen, who quickly handed him a note asking him to add it.
  　
　　After Much Entreaty, She Finally Appears, Still Holding a Pipa, Half-Concealed
　　The Democratic Socialist Party participated in the "National Assembly," but Zhang Junmai, who advocated participation, pretended not to attend. A Shanghai evening newspaper reported on this matter with the headline "After Much Entreaty, She Finally Appears, Still Holding a Pipa, Half-Concealed." A certain newspaper said: We feel sorry for Mr. Zhang Junmai because that is too lacking in political morality. It also said: This struggle over the "National Assembly" issue is truly the most wonderful play in Chinese political history. It is like a searchlight, illuminating all political figures, whether they are righteous or evil, true or false, exposing them completely, with no place to hide.

### “国大”拾零

　　“国大”拾零
    国大筹备费超过一百亿
    据官方发表，此次“国大”筹备费为一百亿元，其实远不止此。即以一百亿计算，如用以救济饥民，即可使五十万人饱食一月；如用以办学，可收容南京全市失学儿童。沪一民间报纸记者十八日往天竺路访张嘉璇未遇，张之守门工友对该记者谈及“国大”说：“开国民大会到底对老百姓有什么好处？还不如把这笔钱送给老百姓来得实惠呢”。
  　美式宪兵警卫百姓频受惊扰
    国民大会堂周围，由全付美式装备的宪兵警卫，戒备极其森严，凡是代表足迹到处均密布警察，国府路一切汽车及其他交通工具，均禁止通行，只大餐馆送酒席的汽车例外（这些大餐馆均被包订招待“代表”）。“国大”开幕前，附近街道举行了三次户口大检查，开会后许多老百姓仍受意外惊扰，宪警的高声斥骂，已成家常便饭。
  　报贩叫破喉号外没人买
    “国大”开幕消息到了重庆，晚上各官报照例发号外，街上报贩叫破喉咙，也没有人看，也没有人买，比刚刚“战胜”时抢买号外的热烈，是完全两样了。
  　青年党忽形阔绰服装店手忙脚乱
    青年党“代表”到京后，忽形阔绰。男男女女赶缝新衣，弄得服装店，手忙脚乱。同时青年党办事处已由蒋家宪兵加以守卫。二十一日洪兰友报告主席团候选名单时漏了青年党“代表”，急坏了雷震，忙递了一个条子叫他补上。
  　千呼万唤始出来犹抱琵琶半遮面
    民社党参加“国大”，主张参加的张君劢，自己却装模作样的不出席。上海某晚报报导此事之标题为“千呼万喊始出来，犹抱琵琶半遮面”。某报说：我们很替张君劢先生惜，因为那太缺乏政治道德。又称：这次“国大”问题的斗争，在中国政治史上，真是一幕再精彩也没有的把戏，它简直像一座探照灯一样，一切政党人物是正是邪、是真是假，被照得毫毛毕现，无所遁其形。（新华社延安三十日电）
