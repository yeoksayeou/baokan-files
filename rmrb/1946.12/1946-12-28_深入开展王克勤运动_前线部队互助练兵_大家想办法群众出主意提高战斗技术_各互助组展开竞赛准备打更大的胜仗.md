　　[This dispatch from our JiluYu Front on the 25th] Since the Puyang and Huaxian battles, a certain unit on the front line has seized the gaps in the war to deeply develop Wang Keqin's military training and mutual assistance movement, preparing to fight even greater victories and perform meritorious service for the people.
　　At the merit awarding meeting of the 2314 unit, Zhang Sizi, a well-known hero in killing the enemy, said: "I have made some contributions in the past, but I know that making contributions alone is not enough. We must help each other well to strengthen our techniques."
　　The 233rd unit widely launched a merit competition. Each mutual aid group wanted to compete with the Fan Zhouqin group, which seized anti-tank guns in the Shangguan Village battle. Zheng Guitang, a first-class hero in killing the enemy, said: "Our mutual aid group has been formed, and everyone is energetic in training and sharpening their swords. Please give me assault missions during battles." The slogan put forward by a certain unit was: "Without a sharp knife, you can't eat fat meat; without skills, you can't win battles." Comrade Wang Jinkun, the squad leader of this unit, led his entire squad to throw grenades outside the village before dawn. Comrade Bai Wenbing was afraid of waking everyone up, so he pretended to urinate and ran outside the village to throw grenades by himself. The instructor went out to urinate and heard voices. He ran over to take a look and found that comrades from a certain platoon were automatically operating. He was so moved that he immediately joined the ranks. New recruit Zhu Qiu Jiu was panting with exhaustion. The group leader asked him to take a break, but he pretended to urinate and ran to the side to throw grenades again.
　　After the start of the military training, a certain unit, based on the experiences reported by various units, came to the conclusion that mutual assistance in military training is the best basic organizational form. It also convened two squads to help each other in military training. The better group leaders held symposiums for everyone to exchange experiences. At the meeting, Li Qijun said: "Mutual assistance in military training is the best. Currently, six of the fourteen people in our squad are technically weak. If we only rely on the squad leader and deputy squad leader to teach, it would be too much to handle. This time, the exercises are all learned through mutual aid groups. The group leader is chosen by ourselves, and no one wants to fall behind, so the learning is very enthusiastic. Five soldiers in the squad could not aim and disassemble guns, but they all learned it in half a day; six comrades could not dig fortifications, but they learned it in one day. Wang Lilin and Shen Linzhi only threw grenades 16 or 17 meters. The group leader taught them the essentials of throwing grenades, and it increased to 27 or 28 meters in a week. Because of the mutual aid group, a week's worth of lessons was learned very proficiently in four days." Li Shaojun thought that he was an infantry squad and would be responsible for assaults, but the new comrades did not know how to fight with bayonets, so he automatically taught everyone how to stab.
　　In the military training, everyone personally experienced the benefits of mutual aid groups and felt the role of mutual aid groups in combat, which is: organized action, no dispersion, a few people together can be brave, concentrated firepower, easy to suppress the enemy, and easy to control during night operations. This deepened their understanding of what Comrade Wang Keqin said: "At home, you rely on your parents, but when you come out to revolution, you rely on mutual assistance."

　　[Dispatch from the JiluYu Front Reporter Group on the 24th] In order to perform greater meritorious service for the people, a certain unit on our JiluYu Front launched a movement for everyone to think of ways, the masses to offer ideas, and to improve tactics and techniques. The unit recently convened "one-stop meetings" and "Zhuge Liang symposiums" with cadres at all levels, combat heroes, and newly liberated soldiers. Combat heroes introduced their combat experience and proposed methods for future combat. The newly liberated soldiers described their combat experiences in the Kuomintang army and provided opinions for future combat. These meetings were of great help to the leadership. After the meetings, soldiers of various squads and platoons held meetings to study how to improve grenade throwing, shooting, attacking, night combat, and other techniques, and conducted field exercises, launching various technical competitions. The combat will and confidence in victory of the troops have been further enhanced.

　　深入开展王克勤运动
    前线部队互助练兵
    大家想办法群众出主意提高战斗技术
    各互助组展开竞赛准备打更大的胜仗
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十五日电】自濮、滑战役后，前线某部即抓紧战争间隙，深入开展王克勤的练兵互助运动，准备打更大的胜仗，为人民立功。
    二三一四部立功会上，有名的杀敌英雄张四子说：“我过去立了一点功，但是我知道要立功，单人独马是不顶事的，我们要很好的互助起来加强技术。”
    二三三部队广泛展开立功竞赛，各互助组都要和上官村战斗缴获战防炮的樊周钦组比赛。甲等杀敌英雄郑桂堂说：“我们互助组都编好了，大家练兵磨刀满有劲，打仗时请上级一定给我突击任务。”某部提出的口号是：“没有快刀就吃不成肥肉，没有本领就打不了胜仗。”该部一班长王金坤同志，带领全班天不明就到村外投炸弹。白文冰同志怕惊醒大家睡觉，自己装作小便独自跑到村外去投炸弹。指导员出外小便，听到人声，跑去一看，原来是某排的同志自动在操作，他感动得也立即加入了行列。新战士朱秋九累得喘不过气来，组长拉他歇歇，他装拉尿跑到一边又投起炸弹来。
    某部队在练兵开始后，根据各部汇报的经验，得到了互助起来练兵是最好的基本组织形式的结论，并且召集了两个班互助练兵。较好的组长给大家开座谈会，交换经验。会上李其俊说：“互助练兵是最好的，我们班里现下十四人有六人技术不行，如果只靠班长副班长来教，就简直忙不过来，这次操课都是通过互助组来学习，组长是自己选的，各组比赛，谁也不愿落后，所以学习很起劲。班内有五个战士不会瞄准和拆卸枪枝，只半天就全部学会了；有六个同志不会挖工事，一天就学会了。王立林、申林志投弹只十六七米达，组长教给他投弹要领，一礼拜就增加到二十七、八米达。因为有了互助组，一礼拜的课目四天就学得十分熟练。”李少俊想到自己是步兵班，要担任突击，新同志却不会拼刺刀，于是就自动教大家学会了刺杀。
    在练兵中大家切身的体会到互助组的好处，感到在战斗中互助组的作用，在于：行动有组织，不分散，几个人在一起能壮胆，火力集中，容易压住敌人，夜间行动便于掌握。这样更加深切的懂得了王克勤同志说的：“在家靠父母，出来革命靠互助。”

    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团二十四日电】我冀鲁豫前线某部为了给人民立更大的功劳，展开一个大家想办法，群众出主意，提高战术技术的运动。该部最近分别召集各级干部、战斗英雄及被解放的新战士举行“一揽子会”、“诸葛亮座谈会”；战斗英雄介绍自己的作战经验，提出对今后作战的办法。被解放的新战士叙述自己在蒋军中作战的情形，并提供今后作战的意见。此种会议对领导上帮助很大。会后各班排战士纷纷召开会议，研究如何提高投弹、射击、攻击、夜战等技术，并作实地演习，发起各种技术竞赛。部队战斗意志与胜利信心更加提高。
