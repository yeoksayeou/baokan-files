    [This Newspaper, Taiyue, 9th Dispatch] (Delayed) The local armed forces of Xinjiang staged a surprise attack on Peicun, creating a record of annihilating an enemy platoon in five minutes. On the 15th of last month, a small detachment of our Xinjiang Independent Battalion raided the KMT-puppet 38th Division's 3rd Battalion in Peicun. The enemy attempted to use the crowd attending the market to resist, but Captain Zhu Dengdi of our side saw through this and called out to the masses, saying, "Good people, step aside to both sides of the street, we are the Eighth Route Army." Upon hearing the words "Eighth Route Army," the masses immediately cleared a path, and the brave soldiers charged forward. Just as the enemy turned to flee, one of our sharpshooters hit four enemies with four shots. Two enemies attempted to escape over the wall, one of whom was shot down by our reconnaissance member Comrade Zhao Fugen. The other was so frightened that he knelt down and begged for mercy, saying, "Spare my life, I won't run." At the same time, another detachment of ours had already attacked the blockhouse in the west of the village, and all the dozen or so enemy soldiers guarding it were captured. This battle lasted only five minutes, killing and wounding 36 enemies and capturing 14. Our army suffered no casualties. None of the market-goers were injured, and they all applauded and cheered.

    [This Newspaper, Taiyue, 12th Dispatch] The KMT troops, awed by the might of our army's offensive in Yuanqu, one company of KMT troops stationed on the Jiangyuan Highway at Shitougeda (40 li northwest of the city) surrendered with their weapons. At 4 PM on the 6th, the 2nd Company of the × Battalion of the 163rd Regiment of the KMT army, which was surrounded in Shitougeda, only fired a few shots when our army began the general attack. The 110 men of the company, led by the company commander, crossed the outer moat and surrendered to us, bringing with them one mortar, one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, over 30 rifles, three pistols, over 20 rounds of ammunition, and one telephone. This is the second time the KMT army has surrendered without resistance. The first time was on the 4th in Shenjiazhuang, eight li north of Yuanqu city, when a KMT platoon surrendered on the battlefield with one heavy machine gun, one light machine gun, and 13 rifles.

    新绛地方武装奇袭裴村
    五分钟内解决战斗
    守敌五十人全部就歼
    石头疙瘩蒋军一连毫无抵抗自动投降
    【本报太岳九日电】（迟到）新绛地方武装袭击裴村，创造五分钟歼敌一排的纪录。上月十五日我新绛独立营一小部，奇袭裴村之蒋伪三八部三大队，该敌企图利用赶集群众抵抗，被我朱登弟队长识破，向群众打招呼说：“好老百姓都闪到街道两旁，我们是八路军”。群众听见“八路军”三字，马上让开一条道来，勇士们一股劲打过去，正当敌人回头逃窜时，我某神枪手四枪连中四敌，有两个敌人企图越墙逃跑，其中一个被我侦察员赵福根同志一枪打倒了。另一个吓得跪下求饶说：“枪口留情，我不跑了。”同时，我另一部已攻入村西碉堡内，守敌十余人全部就擒。这一战斗前后仅五分钟，共毙伤敌三十六名，生俘十四名，我军毫无伤亡。赶集群众无一伤亡，莫不鼓掌称快。
    【本报太岳十二日电】蒋军慑于我军垣曲攻势神威，驻绛垣公路上之石头疙瘩（城西北四十里）蒋军一连携机投诚。六日下午四时被包围于石头疙瘩之蒋军一六三团×营二连，待我军开始总攻击时，仅发炮数响，该连一百一十人在连长率领下，即越过外壕，向我投诚，携带迫击炮一门，重机枪一挺，轻机枪四挺，步枪三十余支，手枪三支，炮弹二十余发，电话机一部。蒋军毫无抵抗之投诚此为第二次，第一次在四日距垣曲城北八里之申家庄，蒋军一排携重机枪一挺，轻机枪一挺，步枪十三支，在战场上投降。（何微）
