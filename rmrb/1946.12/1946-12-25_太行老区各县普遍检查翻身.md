	Thorough Land Reform Inspection in Old Taihang Revolutionary Base Areas

	[This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Changzhi on the 22nd] Land reform inspection is now being carried out extensively in the old Taihang Revolutionary Base Areas. This includes 19 counties: Xingtai, Shahe, Neiqiu, Zanhuang, and Lincheng in the Third Sub-district; Pingshun, Huguan, Licheng, Lucheng, Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, Zuoquan, Yushe, Xiyang, Heshun, and Shouyang in the Second Sub-district; Wu'an and Shexian in the Third Sub-district; and Lingchuan in the Fourth Sub-district.

	Licheng mobilized earliest. It made a breakthrough in the Dongyadie and Dongyangguan key villages in October, gained preliminary experience, and then launched it extensively throughout the county in mid-November. Pingshun, Yushe, Wuxiang, Xiangyuan, Shexian, and other counties also launched it extensively in late November. In early December, Wu'an, Xingtai, Neiqiu, Shahe, Lincheng, Zanhuang, and other counties also universally entered the inspection phase.

	At the beginning of this movement, each county first conducted investigations and research to correctly assess the rent reduction and investigation efforts since 1942. Then, based on the degree of land reform and mass mobilization, they specifically divided the villages into several categories and determined specific plans. For example, Shexian divided villages into three categories: First, villages where farmers were still subjected to feudal exploitation and where despotic landlords had not been thoroughly liquidated, with land reform inspection as the main focus. Second, villages where farmers had gained political status, but feudal exploitation had not been completely eliminated, with winter production as the central task, and land reform inspection carried out during production. Third, villages where feudal exploitation had been eliminated and where the principle of "land to the tiller" had been basically implemented, with production as the main focus.

	Yushe also divided villages into three categories: First, villages where the land issue had been basically resolved, landlords had been defeated, and the masses had been relatively fully mobilized, with winter production as the center, and "cutting off the tails and filling the holes" during production. Second, villages that had initially implemented "land to the tiller" but had not defeated the feudal forces, with land reform inspection as the main task. Third, villages where the land issue had not been resolved thoroughly, requiring in-depth inspection and bold mobilization of the masses to implement land reform.

	This time, because the various localities had adopted the experience of mass movements in the new areas, the cadres clearly defined the following issues from the beginning: First, the goal of the inspection was to completely eliminate feudalism and implement "land to the tiller." For example, the counties in the Second Sub-district proposed "cutting off the tails and filling the holes," and Shexian proposed "filling the gaps and completely achieving liberation." Second, unite with the middle peasants and never infringe upon the interests of the middle peasants and emerging rich peasants. Third, be bold and let go, follow the mass line, start with ideological mobilization, and oppose paternalistic practices. As a result, this movement developed rapidly. For example, Aozhi in Pingshun, Beiguan and Wangjinzhuang in Shexian, and Zhangjiagou in Wuxiang completed the "filling the gaps" in just one month.

	The land reform inspection movement of the past month has proven that: First, there are indeed many villages in the old areas where feudal forces have not yet been eliminated, and many honest farmers have not yet been liberated. Statistics from Tan Village, Haobi, Bai Village, and Beijia in Yushe show that landlords and rich peasants still rent out and pawned more than 350 mu of land. If the land rented and pawned by farmers from landlords in other villages is included, the total is more than 900 mu (a small portion of which belongs to the peasants). The poorest and poor peasants still account for 15% of the population. In Macun, Wu'an, as many as 27 honest farmer households still live in extreme poverty. More than 30 households of migrant workers in Dongbaiyu, Licheng, still live in extremely poor and difficult conditions. Therefore, Xiangyuan's proposal to "inspect every household and fill every gap" is indeed very necessary.

	Second, it is necessary to use democratic methods to enlighten cadres to reflect and become aware of their own shortcomings in order to adjust the relationship between cadres and the masses. Otherwise, not only will the cadres not be reformed, but the land reform inspection movement will also be impossible to implement thoroughly. For example, in Dongbaiyu, Licheng, the village cadres were bought off by landlords. From the beginning of this inspection, the masses had no confidence. The honest farmer Xing'an said: "We won't be liberated even in three generations." Later, after the village cadres reflected and made self-criticism to the masses, and proposed: "Cadres and masses work together to thoroughly carry out land reform," the movement quickly developed. The honest farmer Xing'an said again: "This way, I can be liberated this year." In Lujin Village, the village cadres protected the landlords and their style was not democratic, losing the trust of the masses. At the beginning of this inspection, everyone always lowered their heads and did not speak at several meetings of activists. After the meeting, they discussed: "It doesn't count. The poor people in our village will never be liberated." Later, with the help of district cadres, the political director, village head, and public security officer made self-criticisms to the masses and used the method of "untangling knots" to break the separation between cadres and the masses. The cadres and masses united and crushed the sabotage of special agents and landlords, and launched a struggle against the landlords.

	Third, the investigation and rent reduction must be combined with production. In addition to proper arrangement of time (such as engaging in production during the day, brewing problems, and solving them in winter night schools), the most important thing is to further stimulate the production enthusiasm of the masses through inspection. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the ideological education of "getting rich through production" and never infringing upon the interests of the middle peasants and new rich peasants. For example, in the later period of the inspection movement in Wangjinzhuang, Shexian, it was found that some poor peasants had the idea of "living by eating the fruits of struggle" and despised production, and the middle peasants had a "fear of struggle" and did not want to produce either. After enlightenment and education, it was clarified that "middle and poor peasants are one family, and getting rich still depends on production," and the enthusiasm for production was higher than before.

### 太行老区各县普遍检查翻身

　　太行老区各县
    普遍检查翻身
    【本报长治二十二日电】太行老区翻身检查，现正普遍进行。计有三分区之邢（台）沙（河）内（邱）赞（皇）临（城）；二分区之平（顺）壶（关）黎（城）潞（城）襄（垣）武（乡）左（权）榆（社）昔（阳）和（顺）寿（阳）；三分区之武（安）涉（县）；四分区之陵（川）等十九县。黎城发动最早，十月间在东崖底、东阳关两基点村突开，取得初步经验，十一月中，即在全县普遍展开。平（顺）榆（社）武（乡）襄（垣）涉（县）等县，亦于十一月下旬，普遍展开。十二月初，武（安）邢（台）内（邱）沙（河）临（城）赞（皇）等县也普遍进入检查。这次运动开始，各县均先进行了调查研究，对四二年以来减租，查减作了正确的估价，然后根据土地改革与群众发动程度的不同，具体划分几类村庄，确定了具体方针。如涉县即分三类村进行：一、农民仍受封建剥削，恶霸地主还未经大清算的村，以检查翻身为主。二、农民在政治上有了地位，但封建剥削还未彻底消灭者，中心工作是冬季生产，在生产中进行翻身检查。三、封建剥削已经消灭，基本上实行了耕者有其田的村，则以生产为主。榆社亦分三类村：一、土地问题已基本解决，地主已被打垮，群众发动较充分的村，以冬季生产为中心，在生产中进行“割尾巴、填窟窿”，二、初步实现耕者有其田，但封建势力未打垮的村，要以翻身检查为主。三、土地问题解决的还很不彻底的村，应是深入检查，放手发动群众贯彻土地改革。这次各地由于接受了新区群运的经验，干部一开始便明确了以下几个问题：一、检查的目标是彻底消灭封建，实现耕者有其田，如二分区各县提出：“割尾巴、填窟窿”，涉县提出“填平补齐，彻底翻身”。二、团结中农，决不侵犯中农与新兴富农的利益。三、大胆放手，走群众路线，从思想上发动，反对包办代替。因之，这次运动开展很快。如平顺奥治，涉县北关、王金庄，武乡张家沟等村，短短一月，便完成了“填平补齐”。一月来的翻身检查运动证明了：一、老区确有许多村庄封建势力仍未消灭，不少老实农民仍未翻身。知榆社潭村、郝璧、白村、北家四个村的统计：地主、富农出租与出典的土地还有三百五十余亩，如连农民租种与典种外村地主土地计算，则在九百亩以上（其中少部是农民的）。赤贫与贫农仍占人口百分之十五。武安马村，至今尚有廿七户老实农民仍过着赤贫生活。黎城东柏峪三十余户客民，也仍然过着极其贫困艰难的生活，所以襄垣提出：“挨户检查，户户填平”，实非常必要。二、必须用民主的方式，启发干部反省自觉，来调整干部与群众的关系，否则，不仅干部不能改造，检查翻身运动也将无法贯彻。如黎城东柏峪，村干部被地主收买，这次从检查开始，群众都没信心，老实农民兴安便说：“三辈也翻不了身”。后经村干部经反省，向群众作了自我批评，提出：“干部群众齐努力，要把翻身闹彻底”，运动就很快开展起来，老实农民兴安又说：“这样，我今年就能翻身”。路仅村干部包庇地主，作风不民主，失掉群众信任，这次检查开始，一连几次积极分子会上，大家总是低着头不说话，会后却纷纷议论：“不算话，咱村穷人永翻不了身”，后经区干部帮助，政治主任、村长、公安员，向群众作了反省，用“解圪瘩”的办法把干部与群众隔阂打破，干部与群众就团结一致，粉碎了特务、地主的挑拨离间。对地主便展开了斗争。三、查减必须与生产结合，除了时间要适当安排（如白天搞生产，酝酿问题，黑夜冬学解决）外，最主要的是经过检查，更加激励群众的生产情绪，因此就必须强调“生产发家”的思想教育与决不侵犯中农与新富农的利益。如涉县王金庄检查运动后期，曾发现贫农有“靠吃斗争果实过活”轻视生产的思想，中农有“怕斗”思想，也不想生产。经启发教育，明确了：“中贫农是一家，发家还得靠生产”后，生产情绪便较前更加高涨。（太行分社）
