[Reported by our correspondent group on the front lines of Ji-Lu-Yu on the 13th] The mobile propaganda teams selected from the soldiers of each company of a certain regiment of ours have been working extremely actively since the Patriotic Self-Defense War and have become a major feature of the regiment's political work. The propaganda team preserves the propaganda materials distributed by the higher authorities very well. Often, even when their backpacks are soaked by rain, the propaganda materials are always dry. They say, "Propaganda materials are bombs, and we can't lose them." Li Zhiyin, the leader of the propaganda team of the 3rd company, had no paste to paste leaflets during the Junan blocking battle, so he chewed up dry rice in his mouth to replace it. Dai Decheng of the 7th company calmly used soil to press the propaganda materials on the road while retreating. Wang Xianwen, a correspondent of the 11th company, tied the propaganda materials to sorghum stalks with string. During the famous Zhang Fengji battle, nine Chiang soldiers shrank into a room and refused to surrender. Chang Zhongtang of the 2nd company tied propaganda materials and soil together and threw them in through the gun holes, and as a result, the Chiang soldiers opened the door and surrendered. These methods have been universally adopted by every company after being praised and introduced by the regiment's "Combat News" and the propaganda team leaders' meetings regularly held by the political department.

The work of writing slogans is also very enthusiastic. As of the beginning of November, the entire regiment had written 1,768 slogans, and even the hygiene team had written more than 250. Wang Changcun of the 5th company has cherished a pen for writing slogans since April. He said, "This is also my weapon. It's not easy to get a pen!" He wrote 69 slogans by himself, and the more he wrote, the better his handwriting became, and the more he wanted to write. The clerk of the 9th company wrote a lot himself and also taught three apprentices.

Under the supervision and influence of the propaganda team, the oral propaganda of the entire regiment's soldiers to the masses has almost become a system. Many soldiers report to the squad leader at night, starting with: "I have propagandized to the landlord several times today." The discipline towards the masses has also greatly improved. For example, the 3rd battalion has not requested a single civilian laborer from the Dingcao battle to the present. The political office often gathers people from the propaganda teams of each company who can sing to collectively learn songs, and after learning them, they go back to the company to teach them, which makes the combat morale of the troops even higher.

The leaders of the regiment attach great importance to the propaganda team, constantly improving the organization and continuously educating and training them, so that the work will not be interrupted due to battle casualties. The political instructors of each company believe that the propaganda team has been of great help to them, and the comrades who participate in the propaganda team also believe that participating in propaganda can improve their cultural and working abilities.

　　我某团战士用笔如用枪
    流动宣传组工作活跃
    创造许多散发宣传品的好办法
    向群众口头宣传成为日常工作
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十三日电】我某团各连战士中选拔的流动宣传组，自爱国自卫战争以来，工作异常活跃，已成为该团政治工作一大特色。宣传组对上级发下的宣传品保存的很好，常常下雨浸湿了背包，宣传品常是干干的，他们说：“宣传品就是炸弹，可不能丢了。”三连宣传组长李志银，在巨南阻击战中，没有浆糊贴传单，把干饭放进嘴里嚼烂了来代替。七连戴德成在退却时，不慌不忙地用土块把宣传品压在路上。十一连通讯员王鲜文，用线把宣传品捆在高梁杆上。著名的张凤集战斗中，有九个蒋军缩进一间房子不肯缴枪，二连常忠堂把宣传品和土块捆在一起，从枪眼中投进去，结果蒋军开门交枪了。以上这些办法，经过该团“战斗报”及政治部经常召开的宣传组长会议表扬介绍，已普遍到每一连队。
    涂写标语的工作也很起劲。至十一月初为止，全团已写了一七六八条，连卫生队都写了二百五十多条。五连王长存一支写标语的笔，从四月到现在，每次行军作战都舍不得丢。他说：“这也是我的武器，搞支笔可不容易哩！”他一个人写了六十九条，越写字越好，越写越想写。九连文书自己写得多，又教会了三个徒弟。
    在宣传组的督促与影响之下，全团战士向群众进行口头宣传，几乎已成了一种制度。许多战士晚上向班长汇报，开口就是：“我今天向房东宣传了几次。”群众纪律也大大进步，如三营从定曹战役后到现在，没有要过一个民夫。政治处常常集合各连宣传组会唱歌的人，集体学歌，学会了再回连去教，使部队战斗情绪更加高涨。
    该团领导上对宣传组甚为重视，不断健全组织，不断教育培养，使之不致因战斗伤亡而工作中断。各连政指均认为宣传组对自己帮助很大，参加宣传组的同志也认为参加宣传能提高文化与工作能力。（吴象、虎田）
