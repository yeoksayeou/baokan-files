Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: Large quantities of new grain have been harvested in rural areas of Northern and Western Manchuria. In order to stimulate the sales of agricultural products and adjust the price scissors between agricultural and industrial products, the democratic government is now actively encouraging private grain transportation, enabling them to absorb grain from rural areas, which the government purchases at high prices for transfer to grain-deficient areas. According to statistics from Songjiang Province last month, over 200,000 *shi* of grain have been transferred. In addition, efforts are being made to transport and sell large quantities of edible salt and stabilize cloth prices, so that farmers can purchase sufficient cloth, salt, and daily necessities after selling their grain. Recently, new grain has been continuously transported from Shuangcheng, Bin County, and other places to Harbin, with 800 carts carrying 1,000 tons of grain arriving daily, creating a prosperity unseen in over a decade. To meet the needs of farmers, the Harbin Public-Operated People's Livelihood Company is selling large quantities of weeding machines, hoes, and other farm tools at low prices, leading to farmers eagerly purchasing them.

    农民争购锄草机
    【新华社东北十三日电】北满、西满各地农村已收起大批新粮。民主政府为刺激农产品畅销，调剂农产品与工业品之剪刀差。现正积极奖励私营粮食运输，使其吸收农村中粮食，由政府高价收买，转运缺粮地区。据松江省上月统计，转运粮食已达二十余万石。此外并设法大量运销食盐，平抑布价，使农民于卖出粮食后能买得足够之布匹食盐及日用品。近日双城、宾县各地，新粮已源源不断运往哈市，每日有八百大车一千吨粮食登场，形成十余年来未有之盛况。哈市公营民生公司为适应农民需要，特将大批锄草机、锄头等农具廉价出售，农民纷往争购。
