    Anglo-Indian Negotiations Break Down
    Nehru and Others Fly Back to New Delhi
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th] According to news from various news agencies: The Anglo-Indian talks in London have broken down. Indian National Congress leader Nehru and Sikh representative Singh flew from England to India on the morning of the 7th. Nehru and others, along with Muslim League leader Jinnah and others, arrived in London on the 1st at the invitation of British Prime Minister Attlee to discuss the Indian constitutional issue. Because the Indian Constituent Assembly was scheduled to be held on the 9th, irreconcilable differences still existed between the Congress and the Muslim League on the constitutional issue. The Congress Party insisted on a unified India, while the Muslim League insisted on a divided India, and declared that the provincial constitution issue must be determined before the Constituent Assembly is convened. The Muslim League refused to participate in the Constituent Assembly. The Congress Party, disregarding the Muslim League's refusal, still decided to convene the Constituent Assembly as scheduled and requested the Indian Governor-General to exclude the Muslim League from the interim government if it did not participate in the Constituent Assembly. The British Secretary of State for India, Cripps, and Alexander, who will be the Secretary of State, held multiple meetings with Nehru, Jinnah, and others, attempting to ease the Indian situation, but to no avail. The atmosphere in London was extremely tense. Coinciding with the Anglo-Indian talks, the US Deputy Secretary of State issued a statement on the evening of the 3rd, stating that the United States was very concerned about the situation in India. According to Agence France-Presse and Associated Press reporters, this statement made the tense situation in London even more tense. The US government also announced at the beginning of this month a reduction in import taxes on Indian linen and other products to the United States. Some observers in London believe that this measure by the US is also related to the London talks. When the final meeting on the evening of the 6th yielded no results, Attlee issued a statement saying: "Britain does not recognize the procedure of any constitutional conference in which a large portion of the Indian people are not represented (meaning that it does not recognize the Constituent Assembly to be unilaterally convened by the Congress Party on the 9th)." Nehru and others flew back to New Delhi on the morning of the 7th. Before leaving, Nehru refused to make any comment on this Anglo-Indian conference. According to Agence France-Presse: British Lord President of the Council, Morrison, announced: The British House of Commons will discuss the Indian issue next Thursday or Friday.

    英印谈判破裂
    尼赫鲁等飞返新德里
    【新华社延安八日电】据各通讯社消息：伦敦英印商谈已告破裂。印国大党领袖尼赫鲁与锡克族代表辛格已于七日晨由英飞印。尼赫鲁等与回盟领袖金纳等近应英首相艾德礼之邀于一日抵达伦敦，商讨印度制宪问题，因印制宪议会将于九日举行，而国回间对制宪问题仍存在不可调和之分歧。国大方面坚持统一的印度，回盟则坚持分治的印度，并声明须在召开制宪议会前先确定省宪问题。回盟拒绝参加制宪议会，国大方面不顾回盟之拒绝，仍决定按期召开制宪议会下，要求印督加回盟不参加制宪议会，则排除回盟出临时政府。印度事务大臣克利浦斯及将任国务聊的亚历山大等，曾与尼赫鲁金纳等举行多次会谈，图缓和印局，惟无结果，伦敦空气极为紧张。恰与英印会谈之同时，美副国务卿三日晚发表声明谓美国非常关怀印度局势。据法新闻处及美联社记者称：此声明使得伦敦紧张之局势愈加紧张。美政府并于本月初宣布减低印度亚麻等输美的进口税。伦敦若干观察家认为美方此项措施亦与伦敦会谈不无关系。在六日晚间最后一次会议上无任何成果时，艾德礼发表一声明说：“英国不承认印度大部分人民无代表参加的任何制宪会议的程序（意即不承认九日国大将单方面召开的制宪议会）。尼赫鲁等于七日晨乘机飞返新德里，行前尼赫鲁对此次英印会议拒绝发表任何谈话。据法新闻处讯：英枢密大臣摩利逊宣布：英下院将于下星期四或星期五讨论印度问题。
