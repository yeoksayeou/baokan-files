Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 12th: Chenggong Lake News: The Franco issue was submitted by the subcommittee to the Political and Security Committee for discussion on the 9th. On that day, the committee passed a resolution requesting member states that still maintain diplomatic relations with Spain to recall their ambassadors and other representatives stationed in Spain. The committee passed a recommendation that all UN member states sever diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain. Twenty-seven countries, including Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, voted in favor, while the United States and other countries abstained. The case has been submitted to the UN General Assembly for final vote. Before the vote on this case, France proposed imposing an economic blockade on Spain in the committee, but it was unfortunately not passed.

[Another News] Under the auspices of the Committee to Win the Peace, American war veteran held a demonstration at the New York residence of US representative Connally on the 10th, opposing Connally's harsh measures against the Committee to Win the Peace, and decided to hold similar demonstrations in front of the UN temporary venue from the 10th to the 13th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 11th: Chenggong Lake News: A UN subcommittee passed a resolution on the 8th recommending that UN member states sever diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain. In addition to the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Cuba, and Colombia, the Chiang government representative also opposed the proposal. Although China has long had no diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain, the Chiang government representative, who blindly followed the United States, opposed severing ties with Franco, as if the Chiang government still wanted to re-establish diplomatic relations with Franco. The subcommittee that passed this proposal was entrusted by the Political and Security Committee to handle proposals from all parties related to Franco's Spain. Since the 5th, it has met to discuss three proposals: Poland's "recommendation to sever diplomatic and economic relations," the United States' "recommendation of non-interference," and Colombia's "recommendation for discussion next year." After four days of debate, the Polish proposal, amended by five Latin American countries (i.e., only severing diplomatic relations), was passed.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 11th: Chenggong Lake News: The UN Disarmament Subcommittee passed an important resolution on the 9th, which stipulates: (1) The UN General Assembly should recommend that member states gradually and evenly withdraw their troops stationed abroad. (2) Troops stationed within the territory of other UN members without consent should be withdrawn quickly. (3) National troops should be demobilized. The subcommittee was entrusted by the Political and Security Committee to discuss proposals from all parties on the issue of disarmament starting from the 5th. In addition to the above proposal, the following have also been passed: (1) Recommend that the General Assembly declare the necessity of disarmament. (2) The Atomic Energy Commission should complete its task in the shortest possible time, and the Security Council should expedite the review of the report to be submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission, and expedite the drafting of an international convention banning atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The focus of the unresolved dispute is the relationship between the two disarmament control committees established by the Soviet Union and the Security Council. The Soviet Union advocates that its work should be supervised by the Security Council because the UN Charter grants the Security Council this power, while the United States advocates complete separation from the Security Council.

    联大政治安全委员会通过决议
    建议各国与佛朗哥绝交
    蒋家代表唯美是从投反对票
    裁军问题获重要协议
    【新华社延安十二日电】成功湖讯：佛朗哥问题已于九日由小组委员会提交政治安全委员会讨论。是日，该委员会通过要求现仍与西班牙保持外交关系之会员国召回其驻西班牙外使及其他代表。该委员会所通过之建议，即联合国各会员国与佛朗哥西班牙断绝外交关系。投赞成票者有英法苏等二十七国，而美国等国则弃权。该案已提交联合国大会作最后表决。法国于此案表决之前，在委员会上提议实施对西经济封锁，惜未获通过。
    【又讯】在争取和平委员会主持下，美参战退伍军人于十日在美代表康纳利之纽约邸宅举行示威，反对康氏以严厉手段对付争取和平委员会，并决定自十日至十三日在联合国临时会场门前举行同样的示威。
    【新华社延安十一日电】成功湖讯：联合国一小组委员会已于八日通过建议联合国各会员国与佛朗哥西班牙断绝外交关系。反对该案者除美英荷古巴及哥伦比亚外，尚有蒋政府代表。虽然中国许久以来即与佛朗哥西班牙无外交关系，但一味唯美国马首是瞻的蒋政府代表却反对与佛朗哥绝交，似乎蒋政府还想和佛朗哥重建外交关系。通过此提案之小组委员会为受政治安全委员会之托而处理有关佛朗哥西班牙问题之各方提案者，自五日以来即集会讨论波兰“建议断绝外交及经济关系”，美国“建议不干涉”与哥伦比亚“建议明年讨论”三个提案。四天的辩论，结果乃通过经五个拉丁美洲国家修正（即仅断绝外交关系）的波兰建议。
    【新华社延安十一日电】成功湖讯：联合国裁军问题小组委员会于九日通过重要决议，其中规定：（一）联合国大会应建议各会员国将驻外军队作逐渐而均衡的撤退。（二）未经同意而驻在其他联合国境内之军队，应迅速撤退。（三）各国国内军队应复员。该小组委员会乃受政治安全委员会之托于五日起讨论各方关于裁军问题的建议。除上述议案外，已通过者尚有：（一）建议联大宣布裁军之必要。（二）原子能委员会应在最短期间完成任务，安理会应加速审查原子能委员会行将提交之报告，并加速拟定禁用原子武器及其他大量毁灭性武器之国际公约草案。迄未解决之争论焦点为苏方建议建立之两队裁军管制委员会与安理会之关系，苏方主张其工作受安理会监督，因联合国宪章赋予安理会此职权，美方则主张完全脱离安理会。
