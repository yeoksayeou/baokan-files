　　Taihang Third Administrative Office
    Allocates Grain to Console Basic Armed Forces
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Taihang Third Administrative Office allocated 40,000 catties of grain to console the basic force corps and local armed forces in the area. Commissioner Li and Deputy Commissioner Liu sent a letter of condolence, which stated: Our division's basic force corps and local armed forces have repeatedly defeated the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in the patriotic self-defense war, ensuring the safe transfer of materials from the border areas of our district. Now they have moved into the vast enemy-occupied areas to carry out guerrilla warfare. Their bravery and hardship are deeply admired and remembered by the people of the division. We specially represent the people of the district in consoling them with 40,000 catties of grain, so that our wounded soldiers can increase their nutrition, recover their health as soon as possible, and return to the battlefield.
