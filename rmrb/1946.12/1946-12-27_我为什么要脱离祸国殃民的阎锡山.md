　　I Am Breaking Away From the Calamitous and Corrupt阎锡山 (Yan Xishan)
    Zhang Rongfan
    (The author was the division commander of Yan Xishan's Police 3rd Division and one of the founders of Yan's special agent organization, the "Enemy Work Group." After being captured in the Hongzhao Campaign following the Shangdang Campaign last year, he was deeply moved by seeing the construction in the liberated areas and the various policies of the Communist Party, all of which were for the benefit of the people, in comparison to the situation in Yan's controlled area. Therefore, he wrote this article to denounce Yan Xishan.)
　　I am a stubborn old soldier. Since childhood, I studied books such as military regulations and received fascist education. At that time, I only thought that whoever was my superior, I would obey his orders. Whoever was the ruler of the authorities, he was the representative of the country and the nation. In this way, I stepped into the reactionary group under Yan Xishan's dark rule.

　　After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yan Xishan personally created a large set of organizations. He hoped that people would all enter this trap so that he could intensify his intensified special agent rule. Therefore, he said: "Organization is a paradise, and you don't know its beauty until you enter it." At the same time, he put forward deceptive slogans such as "revolution" and "progress." I was deceived by these slogans and participated in political training. At that time, I thought that I had taken a step forward in my political level, and my interest in doing things was greatly aroused. I gathered a group of young people and started an enemy work organization, becoming Yan Xishan's most reactionary special agent group! Yan Xishan also introduced me to the extremely feudal "Iron Army" organization and appointed me as the head of various organizations for many times. He trusted me extraordinarily. At the age of twenty-four, I was appointed as the Education Director of the Camp School, and at the age of thirty, I was transferred to the position of Major General Division Commander of the Political Security Third Division. I thought that Yan Xishan claimed to "control the globe," and I could at least control any part of the globe.

　　Since I had entered the trap, my whole body was covered with the chains of discipline. Yan Xishan said: "You only recognize me, Yan, in your eyes. Even the words of Deputy Commander Yang (Aiyuan) must be considered enough to be loyal." Zhao Daiwen, who called himself Yan Xishan's prime minister, said: "Our Chairman (Yan Xishan) is truly a modern saint!" "I don't even dare to sit on the chair that the Chairman sits on." It was in such an environment of self-singing and self-praising, or co-performing a duet, that my thoughts were stuffed into his magic box, and I unconsciously became a loyal and docile slave. At that time, I thought that Yan Xishan was more intelligent and great than any political figure. Even Yan Xishan's collection of speeches was regarded as a religious classic and believed in.

　　During the Hongzhao Campaign last year, I was stationed in Zhaocheng. In just two days, Zhaocheng was captured by General Chen Geng's troops. At that time, the order had been disrupted, but I still ordered to hold on to the courtyard. A soldier trembled and said to me incoherently: "Division Commander, the enemy is very powerful, I dare not fight anymore!" I said: "If you retreat without authorization, I will cut off your head." The soldier replied: "I would rather have the Division Commander kill me, I will not fight anymore!" I knew that the morale was already low. But in order to be loyal to Yan Xishan, I still implemented the determination to hold on. At this time, my headquarters had been heavily surrounded. I once ordered the troops to redeploy, but the troops had already fled in all directions. My subordinates pushed me out and became a prisoner. This is the best end for me to be a "loyal minister"! At that time, although I hated the Eighth Route Army very much, I had to praise them inwardly for several strengths in combat: 1. Strong attacking spirit and not afraid of sacrifice. 2. The speed of attack is so fast that even the best commander can only use the reserve team once. 3. Spirit overwhelms everything and robs the morale of the defenders. 4. Concentrate firepower to control one point. How were these advantages created? At that time, it was considered a mystery that was difficult to understand.

　　When I arrived in the Taiyue Military Region, I asked the people on the road: "What benefits does the Eighth Route Army bring to you?" The people replied: "Since the Eighth Route Army came, we have turned over!" I asked again: "How did you turn over?" The people replied: "In the past, we suffered all kinds of oppression from Yan Xishan. Today, we are not oppressed, and we have clothes to wear and food to eat." Also, during the break, I saw a twelve or thirteen-year-old child reasoning with a soldier, and the soldier immediately accepted his opinion. Things that had never been seen in thousands of years of history are now appearing in the liberated areas, which made me realize the benefits of democracy...….

　　After arriving at the military region, the first shocking thing was the convening of a conference to accuse Yan Xishan. Middle and lower-ranking officers and soldiers poured out like pouring out bitter water. I still adhered to the way of "loyal ministers" and did not say a word, but secretly lamented for Yan Xishan! No wonder the battles in various places were defeated again and again. The troops cultivated by Yan Xishan were most dissatisfied with the "integration of soldiers and farmers" and the constraints and surveillance in the system. The pain they suffered was deeper than mine. This bomb that Yan Xishan was holding would be a fatal gift to him.

　　I asked a militiaman on the road: "What kind of work do you do?" The militiaman replied: "No matter what kind of work, just do some responsibilities for the people!" Even a militiaman knows that their political goal is to serve the people; therefore, they are full of vigor! And Yan Xishan's soldiers are only forced to serve Yan Xishan; therefore, they are discouraged and timid!

　　After reading the People's Leader Mao Zedong's "On Coalition Government," "On New Democracy," and other propositions, as well as the American's "Northwest Journey," I understood that the Communist Party is not for party struggles, let alone for seizing territory, but for the vast number of Chinese people to fight for freedom and oppose the traitorous acts manufactured by the dictatorial government headed by Chiang Kai-shek! The Communist Party's propositions are exactly what the Chinese people want today. And the likes of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, for their own private interests, are doing their best to oppose democracy and are determined to fight the civil war that the people oppose. Since then, I realized a serious problem: I was not made a prisoner by the Eighth Route Army, but had already been made a prisoner by Yan Xishan! A Chinese person does not even understand the actual situation in China, and only listens to Yan Xishan's nonsense. I am really ashamed to be a Chinese citizen; therefore, my environment determined myself. Only by being captured by the Eighth Route Army is the only bridge for me to move from the counter-revolutionary side to the revolutionary side!

　　Yan Xishan is politically opportunistic, feudal, conservative, and isolated. On the one hand, he suppressed the people, and on the other hand, in the midst of doubting people, he created a native-made trickster's ruling method. The form that it takes is the various organizations based on feudalism, such as the "National Revolutionary Comrades Association," the "Iron Army Regiment," the "Enemy Work Group," and the Basic Work Committee. These organizations take the National Revolutionary Comrades Association as the highest leading center. Yan Xishan himself became the president of the Comrades Association, and he himself stipulated that people should call him "Leader" and give him the most respectful ninety-degree bow. When they saw the chairman, they shouted slogans such as "Long live the chairman" and "Good health to the chairman." In terms of the system, he himself stipulated the implementation of so-called "surprise attacks," "secret reports," "denunciations," and other special agent ruling methods. As long as any "surprise attack" or similar note is found, regardless of the truth of the matter, it is first detained and then investigated; Yan Xishan named it "treating the sick if there is a disease, and preventing the disease if there is no disease." At that time, the general public's response to this system was the spread of "If you have a jade box at home, you don't dare to fart"; another person wrote to Yan Xishan: "I only have one request, that is, if someone makes a surprise attack on me, please investigate before handling it." Under Yan Xishan's rule, even the freedom of one's own body must be requested! It cannot be denied that it still played a role in making people afraid to speak. The most important thing is that Yan Xishan himself formulated many organizational disciplines: such as "Those who slander the chairman's remarks will be sanctioned." and dozens of other disciplines. Those who joined the organization knelt on both knees in front of Yan Xishan and swore loudly: "I vow to support the chairman for life, implement the principle of distributing property and securities according to work, ... if there is any violation, I am willing to accept organizational sanctions, and the introducer shall be subject to joint punishment." Division commanders Liu Yongzhi and Zhong Youde died unjustly under such cruel and dark organizational disciplines. Liu Yongzhi was sanctioned because he once said to his subordinates: "The chairman taught us to make finance public, why is his finance not public? He receives more and distributes less, what is the surplus for?..." He was attacked by his subordinates to Yan Xishan. These few words are enough to meet the sanction of the "slander the chairman" discipline, so Yan Xishan approved "permission to sanction." The "sanctions" personally ordered by Yan Xishan are divided into: poisoning, hanging, suicide (gun, knife, rope killing), etc. There are two types of sanctions: 1. Self-disposal. 2. Forced sanctions. He often educated his subordinates by saying: "If you consider whether my words are right or wrong; you are suspected of being a traitor."

　　Yan Xishan also played a farce of "democratic" elections within the "organization." In order to cater to people's psychology, Yan Xishan convened a so-called "Respect and Struggle Conference" and, for the first time, wanted to use elections to produce high-ranking cadres in charge of the Comrades Association's decision-making. Beforehand, Yan Xishan spent a lot of effort talking about "the overall organization," "being capable of organizational tasks," and "not allowing small circles to be drawn." After carrying out these preparatory work, he thought that this group of people would definitely follow the established big circle that he had drawn, so he announced the first-ever election method of "single-named, not anonymous" voting. As a result of the election, Li Jiangfu was elected as the Director of the Basic Work Committee (the Basic Work Committee is the leading center of the Comrades Association), and Liang Huazhi, who was liked by Yan Xishan, actually failed, which completely violated Yan Xishan's system of distribution according to Yan. Well, this election caused a great disaster!? Yan Xishan, on the spot, angrily scolded, stuttering and furious. Yan Xishan decided that each group would produce a representative to meet at Yan Xishan's private residence and temporarily revise the "organizational discipline." Yan Xishan personally said: "What is your intention to elect Liang Huazhi as a high-ranking cadre stationed abroad?! You should beat to death on the spot as a butcher who destroys the organization?!..." After the representatives went out, they looked at each other, staring and sticking out their tongues. They held another meeting, and Yan Xishan announced: "I have the power of concentration, and I should overturn the previous election case and hold another election. I think everyone must think it is fair and reasonable?" The electors were afraid of committing the crime of being beaten to death on the spot by the butcher, so they followed the order and copied from their notebooks. When it was almost time to collect the votes, Yan Xishan declared: "What I told you representatives is just my introduction, you don't have to stick to it!?" This election was a complete victory. Out of more than 500 people in the audience, except for one vote that Liang Huazhi had arranged in advance not to vote for Liang as a foil, and another vote that Liang himself voted for someone else, the rest were completely elected Liang Huazhi. This election was even more different from the previous one. Before the election, special attention was paid to the procedures, such as first electing the teller, the ballot checker, the supervisor, the announcer, and the recorder, and these people had to be approved one by one by the whole body. After the election, Yan Xishan was still angry and refused to meet; the high-ranking cadres elected Wang Jingguo and other representatives to meet on behalf of all the high-ranking cadres. Yan Xishan cried with his head in his arms, and said while crying: "You are not of one mind with me!?" "I will take 10,000 people to fight guerrilla warfare!?" The participating high-ranking cadres could not step down, so they had to kneel on both knees and shed tears with him, until Yan Xishan spoke before leaving! Wang Jingguo said as he walked: "Fifteen minutes of tears, and the organization becomes a whole!?"

　　In short, these reactionary, feudal, stubborn, and backward monsters of Yan Xishan are being placed in front of the Chinese people's revolution, and the revolution must first eliminate these obstacles. No matter how he disguises his face with new tricks, as long as you compare it with the facts, it is not difficult to see through the essence of his deception. Yan Xishan calls himself "a military governor who has not fallen for one or two decades," and considers it a glorious page in his history; in my opinion, he is an antique that should have been displayed in the museum long ago. But he shamelessly decorated the old antique with some deceptive patterns, thus deceiving some pure young people. Yan Xishan, on the one hand, grasped the policy of not leaving Shanxi and made full use of this feudal and stubborn group as a basis; on the other hand, he used the patterns of this newly decorated old antique as a cover and a sign, and fortunately lingered for thirty years.

　　This native-made political monster Yan Xishan and the Japanese-made and American-made political monster Chiang Kai-shek are basically from the same hill. If Chiang Kai-shek is compared to a lonely tiger, Yan Xishan is naturally an empty frame. Yan Xishan and Chiang Kai-shek are both traitors and national traitors, this kind of rare national scum in history, is still using force and creating disasters, it is really full of evil, forcing the people to liquidate their crimes. I am ashamed to be with these stupid thieves, oppose their traitorous and rebellious acts, I want to leave them, jump out of that sinful abyss, and resolutely fight to the end for peace, independence, and democracy!

　　我为什么要脱离祸国殃民的阎锡山
    张荣泛
    作者是阎锡山警三师师长，阎特务组织“敌工团”创始人之一，去年上党战役后之洪赵战役被俘，看到解放区各种建设，共产党各种政策，都全为老百姓，与阎统治区情况对比，很受感动，于是写此文控诉阎锡山。
                                                    ——编者
    我是一个顽固的旧军人；自幼攻读典范令等书，接受法西斯教育，那时只认为谁是我的上级，我就服从谁的命令。谁是当局的统治者，谁就是国家民族的代表人，就这样步入了阎锡山黑暗统制的反动集团。
    抗战开始后，阎锡山亲手搞了一大套组织，他希望人们一齐钻入这个圈套，好厉行其变本加厉的特务统治；所以他说：“组织是世外桃园，不入其内，不知其美。”同时提出“革命”、“进步”等等欺骗口号。我受了这些口号的欺骗，参加了政治训练。当时自认为在政治水准上提高了一步，勃然兴起干的兴趣，我纠合了一批青年搞起敌工组织。成为阎锡山御用的最反动的特务团体！阎锡山又介绍我加入了极封建的“铁军”组织，历次指定为各个组织负责人，对我异常信任，我二十四岁派任随营总校教育长，三十岁调任政卫第三师少将师长。自以为阎锡山自称“统制全球”，我至少也可以统制全球任何一部。
    我既钻入了圈套，浑身带满了纪律锁练，阎锡山讲：“你们眼里只认我阎某人，连杨副长官（爱源）的话也必须加以考虑才够忠贞。”自称为阎锡山宰相的赵戴文说：“我们会长（阎锡山）真正是现代圣人啊！”“会长坐的椅子，我也不敢坐一下。”就在这样的自拉自唱，或合演双簧的环境下，把我的思想装进了他那魔术箱，我不自觉的作了忠心耿耿的驯良奴隶。当时我认为阎锡山比任何政治人物高明与伟大，连阎锡山的言论集，我都奉为宗教经典式的那样信仰。
    去年洪赵战役时，我驻守赵城，仅二天，赵城即被陈赓将军所部攻破。当时，秩序已乱，我仍下令坚守院落。一个士兵颤栗着语不成声的向我说：“师长，敌人厉害的很，我不敢打了！”我说：“你擅自退却，我要砍你的脑袋。”士兵答：“宁教师长杀了我，我也不再打了！”我深知士气已馁。但为了尽忠于阎锡山，仍贯彻坚守决心，此时我的司令部已被重重包围，曾命令部队重新布防，但部队早已四散奔命了，部属们把我拥出来，当了俘虏，这就是我当“忠臣”最好的下场！当时我对八路军虽仇恨万分，但内心不得不赞许他们作战的几点长处：一、攻击精神旺盛不怕牺牲。二、进攻速度的迅速，最好指挥能力者亦仅能使用预备队一次。三、精神压倒一切，夺尽守军士气。四、集中火力控制一点。这些优点究竟怎样造成的，那时认为是自难理解的谜。
    到太岳军区时，我在路上问老百姓：“八路军对你们有什么好处？”老百姓答：“自从八路军来，我们才翻了身！”我又问：“你们怎样翻了身？”老百姓答：“过去受尽阎锡山的压迫，今天不受压迫，也有衣穿，也有饭吃了。”又在休息的时候，看见一个十二三岁的儿童，向一个士兵讲道理，士兵马上接受他的意见。几千年历史上从未见到的事，今天出现在解放区，由此使我意味到了民主的好处………。
    到达军区后，第一件惊心触目的事，就是召开控诉阎锡山大会。中下级军官士兵，如倒苦水般的倾盆而出，我仍守“忠臣”之道，不发一言，但暗暗替阎锡山悲叹！无怪乎各地战役一败再败，阎锡山一手扶植的部队，他们最不满意的是“兵农合一”和制度上的牵制监视；他们受到的痛苦，比我更深，阎锡山怀抱的这颗炸弹，将是他致命的礼物。
    我在路上曾问一个民兵：“你干什么工作？”民兵答：“不管什么工作，只给人民尽些责任！”连一个民兵也知道他们的政治目标是为人民服务；因而气壮山河！而阎锡山的士兵只是被逼为阎锡山服务；因而气丧胆怯！
    我看了人民领袖毛泽东著的《论联合政府》《新民主主义论》等等主张，及美国人著的《西北漫行记》之后，了解了共产党不是为了党派斗争，更不是争夺地盘，而是为中国广大人民争自由，反对蒋介石为首的独裁政府一手制造的卖国行为！共产党的主张正是今天中国人民的要求。而蒋介石阎锡山之流，为了私利，竭力反对民主，决心打人民所反对的内战。自此我认识了一个严重问题，我不是做了八路军的俘虏，而是早已做了阎锡山的俘虏！一个中国人连中国的实际情形还不了解，只听的是阎锡山的胡说八道，我真惭愧为中国国民；因而我的环境就决定了我自己，只有被八路军俘虏，才是我由反革命方面走到革命方面的唯一桥梁！
    阎锡山在政治方面，投机取巧，封建守旧，孤立割据。一面镇压人民，一面自疑疑人中，产生了土造骗子手的统治办法。表现在形态上的就是他以封建为基础的各个组织，有所谓“民族革命同志会”，“铁军团”，“敌工团”，基干工作委员会。这些组织，以民族革命同志会，最高领导中枢。阎锡山自己做了同志会会长，自己规定人们称他“领袖”，对他行最恭敬的九十度鞠躬礼，见了会长高呼“会长万岁”、“会长健康”等口号。在制度上，自己又规定了实行所谓“突击”、“密报”、“检举”等等特务统治办法。只要发现任何一片“突击”一类的纸条，不论事实真象如何，先扣押后调查；阎锡山定名为“有病治病，无病防病。”当时一般人对这个制度的反映，有“家有玉匣记，不敢放个屁”的流传；又有一个人上书阎锡山；“我只有一个要求，就是如有人突击下我时，请调查后再行处理。”阎锡山统治下，连自己身体的自由也须经过要求！不能否认的，还是起了些使钳口不敢说话的作用。最重要的是阎锡山自己，拟订了组织纪律多条：如“污蔑会长言论者制裁。”等等纪律数十条。参加组织者，双膝跪在阎锡山面前高声宣誓：“我誓愿终生拥护会长，实行物产证券按劳分配主义，……如有违犯，甘受组织制裁，介绍人应受连带处分。”师长刘墉之、钟有德，就在这样残酷、黑暗的组织纪律下，当了屈死鬼。刘墉之所以被制裁，因为他曾对他的部下说：“会长教我们财政公开，为什么他的财政不公开呢？领的多，发的少，余款干什么了？……”被部下突击至阎锡山处，就这几句话，已够上“污蔑会长”纪律的制裁，于是阎锡山批“准予制裁”。阎锡山自己手订的“制裁”，分：服毒、悬梁、自杀（枪、刀、绳杀）等项。制裁种类有二：一、是自裁。二、是强迫制裁。经常教育他的部下说：“如果你们考虑我的话对不对；就有叛徒嫌疑。”
    阎锡山“组织”内，也曾玩过一次“民主”选举的活剧。阎锡山为要迎合人们的心理，召开所谓“尊敬奋斗会议”中，破天荒的想用选举方式，产生同志会决策的负责高干。阎锡山事前费力的讲什么“组织整体呀”，“堪任组织任务呀”，“不准划小圈呀”，进行了这些准备工作之后，自以为这群人，一定能跟着他划的这个既定的大圈走，于是宣布了，第一次采用“单记名，不记名”投票的选举法。进行选举的结果，李江富选为基工会主任委员（基工会为同志会领导中枢），而阎锡山所喜欢的梁化之居然落选，完全违反了阎锡山的按阎分配制。好，这一场选举可惹下大祸了！？阎锡当场指鸡比狗的拍案大骂，声颤口吃气愤而去。阎锡山决定每小组产生一个代表，到阎锡山私邸开会，临时重订“组织纪律”，阎锡山面谕：“你们把梁化之选为驻外高干是何居心？！就应按破坏组织的刽子手当场打死？！………”代表们出门后，面面相觑，瞠目吐舌，再次开会，阎锡山宣布：“我有集中权，应推翻上次选举案另行选举，我想大家一定认为公道合理？”选举人怕干犯刽子手当场打死的罪名，遵照命令照笔记簿誊写，快到收票的时候，阎锡山声明：“我告诉你们代表们的话，只是我的介绍，不必拘泥！？”这一次选举圆满胜利，全场五百余人，除一票系梁化之事先布置的不选梁作点缀，及另一票系梁本人投选他人外，其余完全选的是梁化之。这次选举更有异于上次者，选举前特别讲求手续，象煞有介事的先推举出开票人，检票人，监票人，唱票人，记票人，而这些人都要一个个全体通过。选举毕，阎锡山仍在生气拒绝会见；高干们推选王靖国等代表全体高干参见，阎锡山抱头大哭，且哭且说：“你们和我不一条心啦！？”“我带一万人去打游击啦！？”使参见高干无法下台，只得双膝跪地，陪着流泪，直待阎锡山放话才离去！王靖国边走边说：“十五分钟的眼泪，组织就变成整体了！？”
    总之，阎锡山这些反动、封建、顽固、落后的怪物，正摆在了中国人民革命的面前，革命首先就必须扫除这些障碍。不论他怎样花样翻新的掩饰他那付面孔，只要拿事实略加对照，自不难看穿他那欺骗的实质。阎锡山自称：“一二十年不倒的一个督军”，自认为是其历史光荣一页；在我看来，他是博物院早该陈列的古董。但他竟厚颜无耻的把旧古董上，装置了一些欺骗的花纹，因而欺骗了一些纯洁青年。阎锡山一面掌握了不离山西的政策，充分利用这个封建顽固的集团为基础；一面利用了这个旧古董新装的花纹，做封面，作招牌，侥幸的苟延了三十年。
    阎锡山这个土造的政治怪物，和蒋介石这个日造美造的政治怪物，基本上同出一丘，如果将蒋介石比做孤老虎，阎锡山自然是个空架子。阎锡山蒋介石都是一样的汉奸卖国贼，这种在历史上罕有的民族败类，还在穷兵黩武，散灾造孽，诚是恶贯满盈，逼使人民不得不清算他们的罪恶。我羞于与这些蠢贼为伍、反对他们的卖国汉奸叛逆行为，我要离开他们，跳出那罪恶的渊数，坚决为和平独立民主奋斗到底！
