Commenting on Chiang Kai-shek's "Draft Constitution" Speech
*Liberation Daily* Editorial, December 2nd

Democracy cannot be manufactured by a dictator, unity cannot be manufactured by a splitter, and a constitution cannot be manufactured by a law-breaker. The "National Assembly" and "Constitution" forged by Chiang Kai-shek, the law-breaker, splitter, and dictator, are merely reactionary tools, and the people absolutely do not recognize them, neither in the past, the present, nor the future. We will have further commentary on Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "Draft Constitution" presented to the so-called "National Assembly" on November 28th. Here, we will only discuss the speech he delivered at that time. This speech is a comical mixture of a true villain and a hypocrite, and even those who support him would find it difficult to deny that it is neither fish nor fowl, full of contradictions. First, regarding the so-called "National Assembly," Chiang Kai-shek announced that "the people of the whole country" were gathered in the "National Assembly" hall in Nanjing, and that he was presenting the "Draft Constitution" in the hall, easily declaring that "the government has already handed over the responsibility of the country to the people of the whole country. From today onwards, the people of the whole country must begin to shoulder this important responsibility." Although the people in the hall did not number 450 million, they were said to be "entrusted by the people of the whole country." The people had already "elected" those who would "create the constitution" ten years ago, showing that the people had already fully developed the "ability and habit of exercising political power." But the same Chiang Kai-shek immediately said, "So today I would like to ask everyone to consider the ability and habit of our general compatriots to exercise political power? If we were to implement the Five-Power Constitution today, would the people be able to grasp political power without being infringed upon by the power of governance? I can say that the majority of the people in our country do not yet have this ability and habit." He told the "people of the whole country" in the National Assembly to "not ignore the needs of the people." In this way, Chiang Kai-shek personally confessed that these "representatives" were not "elected" by the "general compatriots" and "majority of the people" to exercise political power, that they still needed to be instructed even on "the needs of the people," and that their "National Assembly" and "Constitution" were, of course, merely forged by a "very small number of special compatriots" under the "infringement of the power of governance."

Second, regarding the so-called "Constitution." Chiang Kai-shek announced that "the Five-Power Constitution is the newest and most progressive constitution in the world." Why? He only cited one mystery, saying that this constitution could only be exercised by one and a half people in the world: "The Five-Power Constitution is best exercised by the Father of the Nation himself," and besides that, only Chiang Kai-shek before the age of sixty was barely qualified when he had "desire and interest." "I believe that if I were to exercise the Five-Power Constitution myself, I would definitely have the Father of the Nation's heart as my heart... But... I personally have no political desire or interest, and I am already sixty years old this year, and I can no longer shoulder the heavy responsibility like I did in the past twenty years, so (alas!) I must entrust the responsibility of the country to my compatriots throughout the country." Otherwise? "Then the president's power will be excessively concentrated, which will inevitably lead to totalitarian politics. This kind of politics is not in line with the current era, and it is harmful to China, harmful to the Chinese nation," "harming the country and the nation," "and is not suitable for today." Therefore, he can only retreat and implement the "newest and most progressive constitution in the world," "handing over the important responsibility of the country to his compatriots throughout the country." But "the majority of the people do not yet have this ability and habit," so what can be done? Fortunately, Chiang Kai-shek revealed a glimmer of hope: the "constitutionalism" in the Nanjing hall would still continue to "political tutelage," continue to "protect political power with the power of governance, cultivate political power, and develop the people's ability and habit of exercising political power," "and by that time, I believe that our Father of the Nation's Five-Power Constitution will definitely be fully realized." Therefore, retreating is for the sake of advancing, temporarily abandoning the "May Fifth Draft Constitution" is for the sake of "definitely being able to fully realize" the "May Fifth Charter." "Today," "currently," "the current era" are all for the sake of "by that time." "Currently," "today," "the current era," Chiang Kai-shek is sixty years old (damn it!). "By that time": Chiang Kai-shek will be sixty and a half years old, and the dream of "crushing the CCP within five months" will be realized; within six months, a "next National Assembly will be produced," and "if there are any opinions on amending the constitution, they can still be proposed for amendment according to the law"; then he can no longer perfunctorily deal with all parties, and then he can "definitely fully realize" his "May Fifth Draft Constitution" and the "most progressive" "totalitarian politics" of the "country and nation." Like the past twenty years, this is the entire "secret" of Chiang Kai-shek's "constitutional" magic.

Third, regarding Chiang Kai-shek himself. Chiang Kai-shek announced that he "originally had no political desires or interests." Fortunately, in the past twenty years, "only because the foundation of the country was not solid and constitutionalism was not implemented, the revolutionary duty could not be abandoned, and there was no room for refusal regarding national affairs," and he was not yet sixty years old, so the Chinese people obtained this unique figure "with the Father of the Nation's heart as his heart," "so that civil rights could be fully developed." The vast majority of these twenty years were the period of "political tutelage," which was even more totalitarian than the totalitarian "constitutionalism," and what were the results? Chiang Kai-shek replied: "I can say that the majority of the people in our country do not yet have this ability and habit. If we were to implement the Five-Power Constitution without any guarantees, I personally believe it would be very dangerous." Chiang Kai-shek has a famous saying: "If you don't succeed, you die trying." Since he has not succeeded in twenty years, making China's democracy "unprotected" and "very dangerous," why doesn't he commit suicide immediately, and why does he still shamelessly boast?

The two components of Chiang Kai-shek's speech are now clear. He says he doesn't want totalitarian politics, he says he has no political desires, he says he wants to hand over power to the people - this is his mask. He says the constitution of totalitarian politics is the newest and most progressive, and it will definitely be fully realized soon, and he automatically nominates himself, saying that only he can be this dictatorial leader - this is his true intention. History often coincides. Yuan Shikai said when he was sixty years old: "This President is old, what more can a sixty-year-old man ask for... I hope to work hard with my fellow countrymen and friends, take risks and overcome difficulties to establish this national foundation, and in the future, as a fortunate citizen of the republic, support myself with a cane in the mountains and valleys to observe governance, so that I can fulfill my original aspirations." At the same time, he was attacking Sun Yat-sen, and later became emperor. Yuan Shikai died not long after he turned sixty. Now, Chiang Kai-shek, who is similarly selling out the country for personal glory, similarly acting against the tide of history, and similarly abandoned by the masses, will not last long either. There is only one difference: the people who oppose selling out the country and oppose dictatorship will definitely achieve a true and complete victory this time, bringing an end to a tragic and filthy period in modern Chinese history forever.

　　评蒋介石“宪草”演说
  　解放日报二日社论
    民主不能由独裁者制造，统一不能由分裂者制造，宪法不能由毁法者制造。毁法者分裂者与独裁者蒋介石所伪造的“国大”和“宪法”，只是反动的工具，人民在过去现在未来，都是绝对不承认的。关于蒋介石在十一月二十八日向所谓“国大”提出的所谓“宪草”，我们将另有评论，这里只说他那时所发表的演说。这个演说是真小人与伪君子的滑稽混合物，甚至支持他的人，也很难否认其非驴非马，矛盾百出。第一、关于所谓“国大”，将介石宣布在南京“国大”礼堂中集合了“全国人民”，并且在礼堂中提出“宪草”，轻而易举的宣布“政府已经将国家的责任交给全国人民了。从今天起，全国人民就要开始担负这个重大的责任。”礼堂里的人虽然没有四万万五千万，但是据说他们是“受全国人民的重托”。全国人民在十年前就“选举”了“创制宪法”的人，可见人民是已经充分养成了“行使政权的能力和习惯”。但是同一个蒋介石，马上又说“所以我今天要请大家估量我们一般同胞行使政权的能力和习惯？我们如果在今天实现五权宪法，人民是否能掌握政权而不受治权的侵犯呢？我可以说，目前我国大多数的人民还没有这种能力和习惯。”他告诉国大中的“全国人民”“不能忽略民众的需要”，这样蒋介石就亲自招认了这些“代表”完全不是“一般同胞”和“大多数人民”行使政权“选举”出来的，他们连“民众的需要”都还待耳提面命，他们的“国大”和“宪法”，当然都只是在“治权侵犯”下“极少数特殊同胞”的伪造。
    第二、关于所谓“宪法”。蒋介石宣布“五权宪法是世界上最新最进步的宪法”。为什么呢？他只举出一种奥妙说这个宪法世界上只能由一个半人来行使：“五权宪法最好是国父本人来行使”，此外就只有六十岁以前的蒋介石在有“欲望和兴趣”的时候勉强够格。“我相信假如我自己来行使五权宪法，我一定能以国父之心为心……但是……我个人本来没有政治的欲望和兴趣，而且我今年已经六十岁，再不能像过去二十年一样担负繁重的责任，所以（呜呼痛哉！）必须将国家的责任交托于全国的同胞”。要不然呢？“则总统权力过分集中，必致形成极权政治，这种政治是不合于现在时代，而且有害于中国，有害于中华民族”“贻害于国家民族”，“在今天是不适用的”。因此只有退而实行“世界上最新最进步的宪法”，“将国家的重要责任交给全国同胞”了。但“目前多数人民还没有这种能力和习惯”，这又如何是好呢？好在蒋介石泄漏了一线天机，原来南京礼堂里的“宪政”还是要继续“训政”，继续“以治权保护政权，培育政权，养成人民行使政权的能力和习惯”，“到了这个时候，我相信我们国父的五权宪法一定能完全实现”。因此退还是为着进，暂时放弃五五宪草，还是为着“一定能完全实现”五五宪章。“今天”“目前”“现在时代”，还是为着“到了这个时候”。“目前”“今天”“现在时代”，蒋介石六十岁（该死！）“到了这个时候”：蒋介石六十岁半了，“五个月内粉碎中共”的梦想实现了；六个月内又“产生下届国大”，“对于宪法如有修改意见仍可依法提出修正”了；于是就可以不再敷衍各方，于是“一定能完全实现”他的“五五宪草”和“最进步”的“国家民族”的“极权政治”。像过去二十年一样，这就是蒋介石“宪法”魔术的全部“秘密”。
    第三、关于蒋介石本人。蒋介石宣布他“本来没有政治欲望和兴趣”。幸而过去二十年中，“只因国基未固宪政未行，革命天职不容放弃，对于国事义无容辞”，而且他还没有六十岁，中国人民这才得到这位“以国父之心为心”的唯一人物，“使民权充分发展”。这二十年绝大部分是比极权的“宪政”还更极权的“训政”时期，而其成绩如何呢？蒋介石答道：“我可以说：我国大多数的人民还没有这种能力和习惯，如果这样毫无保障就实行五权宪法，我个人认为非常危险”。蒋介石有句名言，叫做“不成功便成仁”，他既然二十年都不成功，把中国的民主弄得“毫无保障”，“非常危险”，为什么还不立即自杀，还要大言不惭地大吹其牛呢？
    蒋介石演说中两种成分现在是明明白白了。他说他不要极权政治，说他没有政治欲望，说他要把权力交给人民，这是他的假面具，他说极权政治的宪法最新最进步，不久仍然一定能完全实现，并且自动报名说只有他才可以当这个独裁首领，这是他的真意图。历史常常巧合，袁世凯在六十岁的时候说过：“本大总统老矣，六十老翁复何所求……冀与邦人诸友含辛茹苦冒险犯难立此国基，他日作共和幸民，扶杖山谷，以观治化，庶遂初志。”而就在同时，他就在讨伐孙中山，随后还做了皇帝，袁世凯过了六十岁不久就灭亡了。现在同样卖国求荣，同样倒行逆施，同样众叛亲离的蒋介石，也不会维持很久。只有一点不同，反对卖国反对独裁的人民，在这一回一定会得到真正的彻底的胜利，使近代中国的一段悲惨污秽历史永远结束。
