Ningnan Mass Movement Experience, Part Two
　　Implementing Ideological Mobilization
　　Feng Ji, Yu Lin, Lu Kun, Xiao Han
　　Grasp Every Link of the Movement, Constantly Raise the Consciousness of the Masses
　　[Our Newspaper Weixian Dispatch, 26th] In the Ningnan land reform movement, attention was paid to discovering the ideological patterns of the masses. Appropriate slogans were put forward in each link. Mobilizing the masses for deliberation and conducting ideological education played a great role in the movement.

　　Consolidation Stage: Conduct Large-Scale Recollection of Emancipation
　　Before the struggle, due to the "fate," "conscience," and "sentiment" thinking left over from the old society, and the impact of some cadres' coercive orders and unfair distribution of fruits in past movements, some masses in various villages reflected: "It's useless to talk, we can't do it." "After the change of dynasty, be careful of the landlords' revenge." "The masses offend people, and the cadres benefit." Based on these ideas, the leadership clearly put forward that the heaven belongs to us, everyone unites is the heaven, big and small matters are decided by everyone, and it's time for us to stand up. As the situation opened up, the masses were guided to pour out their grievances. Accusation of suffering is practical material for educating the masses and educating cadres. Experience has proven that the more thoroughly the suffering is recounted, the more thoroughly the exploitation of the landlords will be fought, and the higher the awareness of the peasants will be raised. At the beginning of the mass movement, the masses had many ideological concerns and did not recount their suffering thoroughly. The leadership then proposed to the masses: "Pour out the suffering cleanly, settle the accounts thoroughly," "Turn over completely," ensuring the cleanliness of the accusation. After recounting their suffering, the masses' awareness improved, and they demanded to fight the landlords. But this time, many onlookers still watched, so they proposed: "The more people, the greater the strength," "Unite as one," "Landlord exploitation is the root of poverty," "Middle and poor peasants are one family," "Link up and everyone will be liberated," so that the accusers and activists consciously linked up and organized the majority of the masses, clearly drawing the line between landlords and peasants, and educating peasants "not to be the landlords' lackeys." The Dongwang masses used the education of "open your minds, don't be fooled by the landlords" to win over more than 20 collaborators. After the education was carried out in Dananli, the masses agreed on six major guarantees, including not being a running dog, not collaborating with the enemy, thus consolidating the internal. When resolving the breaking of affection and sectarianism, they proposed "Do it to the end," "Don't be afraid of being slapped in the face," "Regardless of the east or west end, no matter the north or south street, the landlords of the world are all black," "Peasants are one family." After the struggle was won, in order to expand the masses' excitement, various villages paraded and demonstrated their strength. The Zhangzhuang masses removing the landlords' plaques was the most painful thing for the landlords, and at the same time greatly encouraged the masses' emotions. When distributing the fruits, they proposed "Everyone manages the fruits, it must be fair and reasonable." Breaking the masses' concerns, they proposed that everyone be liberated, distribute what is lacking, don't quarrel, arguing won't fill your stomach, giving in will not let you go hungry, we are all one family, don't make a scene at home and let outsiders laugh, don't just think about yourself, think about everyone.

　　Hold "Inspection Meetings," Cadres Make Self-Criticism
　　In the consolidation stage, in order to make the peasants implement ideological revolution, sweep away the peasants' feudal backward superstitious ideas, and establish new ideas, we can use "thinking meetings," "family meetings," positive guidance, reverse questioning, and mutual question-and-answer methods to make each peasant conduct a large-scale recollection of emancipation. At the "thinking meeting" in Dongwangdong Town, the masses collectively composed a song, singing: "Before the Dongwang mass movement, the landlords were in power and it was dark, the poor could not eat enough and were not warmly dressed, suffering was difficult. Not eating enough and not being warmly dressed is not the end, we have been oppressed for thousands of years and cannot turn ourselves over. Now we are very happy, everyone turns over, you complain of suffering, I extend grievances, it is really happy to settle old debts, pull out the root of poverty, plant rich seedlings, and the days are rising higher than the sky. Don't smoke, don't drink, don't waste money." The Daningcao masses proposed "Think again meeting," "Think at any time," some masses answered each other at the "thinking meeting," one asked "How to follow Chairman Mao?" one answered "Following Chairman Mao is listening to him, responding to Chairman Mao's call, and defending the fruits of victory." Another asked, "How to protect it?" answered "Joining the Eighth Route Army can block the Chiang Kai-shek army's attack." "Who will block it?" At this time, the issue of joining the army was discussed, and it was understood that to strengthen the Eighth Route Army, one must participate personally or send one's children to participate. In Dongwangxi Town, immediately after the "thinking meeting," 170 young people joined the militia. In Zhangzhuang, after the "thinking meeting," five members of the Farmers' Association joined the Communist Party.

　　In order to strengthen democratic education, establish the democratic style of cadres, and at the same time solve internal problems of the masses, various villages carried out "inspection meetings" of self-criticism and mutual criticism. Some villages also called them "bathing meetings." The Nandingcao Village cadre inspection meeting lasted a day and a night. Every cadre made a review, reflecting on the merits of resolutely fighting the landlords, not sleeping day and night, not being afraid of tiredness, and past more or less corruption, favoritism, etc. shortcomings, and formulated a democratic system, no matter how big or small, can not be alone, and report to the masses every day. And guide the masses to see the merits of the cadres, do not only see the shortcomings. After Nandingcao established a democratic system, members felt very happy. In the inspection, various villages also resolved many problems among the masses, making "the working people are one family."

　　Establish New Ideas, Sing Praises of the New Society
　　Regarding establishing new ideas and clarifying the direction of the peasants in the future, Ningnan adopted a vigorous election of models and criticized backward movements. The Zhaozhuang Farmers' Association collectively discussed the ten major rules, Nandingcao formulated membership certificates and member covenants. The covenants were discussed by everyone in groups and passed by the general assembly, solemnly sworn, and the masses attached great importance to it as a guide for future actions.

　　After the peasants have undergone the above ideological education combined with action, they feel unparalleled joy after turning over, and naturally demand to carry out entertainment activities in their villages. In large-scale cultural and entertainment activities, the masses excitedly sing praises of emancipation and sing praises of the new society.

　　宁南群运经验之二
    贯彻思想发动
    冯骥　玉林　陆昆　萧寒
    抓紧运动每一环节  不断提高群众觉悟
    【本报威县二十六日电】宁南土地革改运动中，注意发现群众的思想规律，在每个环节中提出适当口号。发动群众酝酿，进行思想教育，对运动起了很大作用。
        巩固阶段进行翻身大回忆
    在斗争前，由于旧社会遗留的“命运”、“良心”、“情面”思想，及过去运动中有些干部强迫命令，果实处理不公等影响，各村有的群众便反映：“咱说了白说，不能干”。“变了天，小心地主的回头食”，“得罪人的是群众，得利的是干部”。领导上根据这些思想，明确提出天是我们的天，大家团结起来就是天，大小事由大家做主，到我们出头的时候了。局面打开，即引导群众倒苦水。诉苦是教育群众，教育干部的实际材料。经验证明，苦诉的净，对地主剥削才会打得彻底，农民觉悟才会提高。群运开始，群众多有思想顾虑，苦诉的不净，领导上便向群众提出“苦水倒净，帐要算彻底”，“翻身要翻透”，保证了苦诉的干净。经过诉苦，群众觉悟提高了，要求和地主干，但这回观望的群众还很多，就提出：“人多力量大”，“团结一条心”，“地主剥削是穷根”，“中贫农是一家”，“串连大家都翻身”，使诉苦者及积极分子，自觉串连组织多数群众，划清了地主与农民的界限，并教育农民“不当地主的腿子”。东汪群众以“打开脑筋，别上地主的当”的教育，争取了二十多个走里分子。大南里在进行教育后，群众议定六大保证，包括不当狗腿，不走里，这样便巩固了内部。在解决打破情面和宗派思想时，提出“干就干到底”，“打破头不怕扇子扇”，“不分东西头，不论南北街，天下地主一样黑”，“农民是一家”。斗争胜利后，为扩大群众的兴奋情绪，各村游行示威，显示力量。张庄群众摘地主的匾，地主感到最痛，同时大大鼓舞了群众情绪。分果实时，提出“果实大家管，既要公平，又要合理”。打破群众的顾虑，提出大家都翻身，缺啥分啥不吵架，争争吵吵吃不饱，尽尽让让吃不了，都是自己一家人，不闹家务叫外人看笑话，别光想自己好，得想大家。
  召开“检查会”  干部自我检讨
    巩固阶段，为使农民实行思想上的革命，扫清农民封建落后迷信思想，树立起新思想，可以通过“想想会”、“家庭会”，正面引导，反面质问，彼此问答等方式，使每个农民进行了翻身大回忆。东汪东镇在“想想会”上，群众集体编了个歌，歌唱“东汪群运前，地主当道多黑暗，穷人们吃不饱穿不暖，困苦多艰难。吃不饱穿不暖，这还不算完，千百年来受压迫不能把身翻。现在大高兴，人人把身翻，你诉苦，我伸冤，清算旧债真喜欢，拔穷根，栽富苗，日子上升比天高。不吸烟，不喝酒，有钱不乱用。”南丁曹群众提出“再想会”，“随时想”，有的群众在“想想会”上互相回答，一个问“怎样跟着毛主席走？”一个答“跟着毛主席走就是听他的话，响应毛主席的号召，保卫胜利果实。”又问“怎样保护？”答“参加八路军才能挡住蒋军进攻。”“谁去挡？”这时便讨论起参军问题，明白了要想壮大八路军，必须亲自参加，或送自己的子弟参加。东汪西镇在“想想会”后，立时有一百七十个青年参加民兵。张庄在“想想会”后，有五个农会员参加了共产党。
    为加强民主教育，树立干部的民主作风，同时解决群众内部问题，各村开展了自我批评、互相批评的“检查会”，也有的村庄叫“洗澡会”，南丁曹村干检查会开了一天一夜，每个干部都作了检查，反省出坚决斗争地主，日夜不睡不怕累等优点，及过去或多或少有些贪污、腐化、包办、命令、情面等缺点，并制定了民主制度，无论大小事不能一人当家，每日向群众报告工作。并引导群众要看到干部的功劳，不要单看到缺点。南丁曹建立了民主制度后，会员感觉到很痛快。各村在检查上，也解决了不少群众间的疙瘩，作到了“劳动人民是一家”。
  树立新思想  歌唱新社会
    关于树立新思想，明确农民今后的方向，宁南采取了轰轰烈烈的选举模范，批评落后运动。赵庄农会集体讨论了十大守则，南丁曹制定了会员证，和会员公约，公约是大家由小组酝酿讨论出来的，并经大会通过，郑重宣誓，群众非常重视，作为以后行动的指针。
    农民经过了以上与行动相结合的思想教育，感到翻身后无比的喜悦，很自然就要求开展本村娱乐活动。在大规模开展文化娱乐活动中，群众兴奋的歌唱着翻身，歌唱着新社会。
