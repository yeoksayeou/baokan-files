　　Italian Six Major City Elections
    Communists Win
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] Reuters reports: In the recent municipal elections in Rome and five other major Italian cities (Genoa, Turin, Naples, Florence, Palermo), the Italian Communist Party has overwhelmed the Christian Democratic Party (headed by the current Prime Minister Gasperi) and become the victor in the election. The Christian Democratic Party, which won the general election in June, is now facing considerable doubt as to whether it can compete with the Communist Party after suffering a series of setbacks. The municipal elections in the six major cities indicate the following trends: (1) The strength of the People's Bloc (i.e., the alliance of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and two other small left-wing parties) is showing an upward trend everywhere; (2) The Christian Democratic Party has lost a large number of masses, even losing the reactionaries who voted for the party in the general election; (3) Many of the votes of the aforementioned reactionaries have been transferred to the Monarchist Party and the Common Man's Movement Party of the Fascists; (4) In the historically conservative southern Italy, there are clear signs that the "Italian People's United Movement" led by the People's Bloc is developing. A Reuters reporter pointed out that all neutral observers in Rome agree that the Communist Party is currently the most powerful single party in Italy.

　　意国六大都市选举
    共产党获胜
    【新华社延安二十四日电】路透社报导：在最近，罗马及其他意大利五大都市（热那亚、都灵、那不勒斯、佛朗伦萨、巴勒摩）的市选中，意大利共产党已压倒了基督教民主党（以现任总理加斯贝利为首），而成为选举的胜利者。六月大选获胜的首席——基督教民主党，在受到纷纷打击后，现在感到能否与共产党抗衡颇成问题了。六大都市的市选，表明了下列的倾向：（一）人民集团（即共产党、社会党与其他两个左翼小党派的联盟）的力量各处都显示在上涨；（二）基督教民主党已失去大批群众，甚至失去了在大选中投票拥护该党的反动分子。（三）上述反动分子的票好多都转移到保皇党与法西斯的平民运动党方面去了。（四）在向来保守的南部意大利，呈现人民集团所领导的“意大利人民统一运动”在开展中的明确征象。路透社记者指出：罗马全部的中立观察家都同意，目前意大利最有力量的单一政党是共产党。
