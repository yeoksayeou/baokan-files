Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 26th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented: On December 20th, Chiang Kai-shek's government signed the "Sino-American Aviation Agreement" with the United States, which is another traitorous treaty by Chiang Kai-shek after the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty." In the commercial treaty, Chiang Kai-shek had already sold China's entire territory and sovereignty over its coastal inland rivers to American imperialism. Therefore, as a "necessary" supplement, his signing of this aviation agreement is the final and complete sale of China's airspace.

According to telegraphs, the main contents of the "Sino-American Aviation Agreement" are twofold: First, it stipulates that American aircraft may load, unload, and transfer passengers and goods in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and "locations to be agreed upon at any time in the future"; second, it stipulates that American aircraft shall also have the right to "non-traffic stopovers" within Chinese territory. According to the first item, American aircraft will be able to fly, load, unload, and transfer everywhere in China in the future, completely controlling China's air transport business. Within the scope of ordinary commercial transportation, it further facilitates American goods' monopoly of the Chinese market. According to the second item, in addition to ordinary transportation, American aircraft shall also have military landing rights. The "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" stipulated that American warships "may enter any port, place, or territorial waters in China due to inclement weather and other dangers." Now, with the addition of this "non-traffic stopover" right for aircraft, all of China will become a military base for American imperialism.

Establishing military bases in China is an important part of American imperialism's world expansion policy. As early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States, under the guise of aiding the war against Japan, established a dense network of air force base clusters in Southwest China. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, it also accepted a large number of Japanese airfields in China. In the negotiations on the transfer of surplus materials from March to August this year, Chiang Kai-shek shamelessly allowed the exchange of all aviation rights as part of the consideration in order to obtain a large amount of civil war materials. In May, a secret agreement was concluded between the US and Chiang, in which the United States obtained the right to conduct military aerial photography in China's internal provinces, the Northeast, and Taiwan. On August 30th, Chiang Kai-shek signed a contract with the American Chennault Air Transport Company, allowing the company's aircraft to operate air transport business in China. On September 2nd, the Chiang government signed the "Shanghai-Manila Aircraft Landing Rights Agreement" with the Philippines, which is controlled by American imperialism. With the formal signing of the "Aviation Agreement" this time, Chiang Kai-shek's "legal procedures" for selling all aviation rights are considered complete.

In his recent statement on China policy, Truman repeatedly defended that the US policy toward China is based on "full respect for Chinese sovereignty." However, the "Sino-American Aviation Agreement," which infringes upon China's entire airspace, was signed exactly three days after his statement was issued. This is a cruel irony to Truman's statement and the best annotation to his so-called "full respect for Chinese sovereignty." And just as the traitor Chiang Kai-shek was signing this new traitorous treaty, he shamelessly talked about "abolishing unequal treaties" in his pseudo-National Assembly's "draft constitution" speech. This once again proves that Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "abolishing unequal treaties" is no different from Wang Jingwei's "abolishing unequal treaties" in both spirit and form.

### 记者评“中美航空协定”称：  它更便利美国独占中国市场  并将全中国变为美军事基地  对杜鲁门最近对华政策声明是个残酷的讽刺

　　新华社记者评“中美航空协定”称：
    它更便利美国独占中国市场  并将全中国变为美军事基地
    对杜鲁门最近对华政策声明是个残酷的讽刺
    【新华社延安二十六日电】新华社记者评称：十二月二十日蒋介石政府与美国签订了“中美航空协定”，这是蒋介石继“中美商约”之后又一卖国条约。蒋介石在商约中就已经将中国全部领土和沿海内河的主权卖给美帝国主义，那么，做为“必要的”补充，他此次签订航空协定是最后和全部地将中国的领空权拍卖干净了。
    根据电讯，“中美航空协定”的主要内容有二：第一、规定美国飞机得在上海、天津、广州及“以后随时同意之地点”装卸和转运乘客货物；第二、规定美国飞机得在中国领土内亦有“非交通之停靠”权。按照第一项，今后美国飞机在中国将到处可以飞行、装卸和转运，完全控制中国的空运事业。在普通商运范围内，更便利了美货的独占中国市场。按照第二项内容，除通常交通外，美国飞机还得有军事性的降落权。“中美商约”中曾规定美国军舰“可因气候恶劣及其他危难进入中国任何口岸地方或领海”，现在再加上这种飞机“非交通停靠”权，这样全中国就将变成美帝国主义的军事基地。
    在中国建立军事基地，乃是美帝国主义世界扩张政策的一个重要部分。远在抗战期间，美国以援助对日作战名义，在中国大西南建立密布的空军基地群；日寇投降后，它又接受了大批日军在华的飞机场。在今年三月到八月的转让剩余物资谈判中，蒋介石为了取得大量内战物资，无耻地允许以全部航空权作为交换品的一部分。五月间，美蒋成立密约，美国取得在中国内部各省及东北、台湾进行军事性的空中摄影之权。八月三十日，蒋介石与美人陈纳德空运公司签订合同，允许该公司飞机在中国经营空运事业。九月二日，蒋政府又与美帝国主义控制下的菲律滨签订“上海马尼拉飞机降落权协定”，此次正式签订“航空协定”，蒋介石出卖全部航空权的“合法手续”就算完成了。
    杜鲁门最近对华政策声明中，还一再辩白美国对华政策系以“充分尊重中国主权”为依据。而侵夺中国全部领空权的“中美航空协定”，恰恰在他的声明发表后的第三日签订，这对杜鲁门的声明是一个残酷讽刺，也是对他的所谓“充分尊重中国主权”下了最好的注解。而卖国贼蒋介石正当其签订这一卖国新约之时，还在其伪“国大”的“宪草”演说中厚颜无耻地大讲其“废除不平等条约”。这再一次地证明了：蒋介石的所谓“废除不平等条约”，和以前汪精卫的“废除不平等条约”，无论在精神上与形式上都毫无二致。
