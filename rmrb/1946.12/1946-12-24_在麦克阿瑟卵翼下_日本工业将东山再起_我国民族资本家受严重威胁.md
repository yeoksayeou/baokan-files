　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Shanghai dispatch: Since MacArthur announced the news that Japanese wool fabrics would be allowed to be resold to the Far East, it has caused great agitation in Chinese national industrial circles here, who believe that this is a warning sign for China's rigid national industry, especially the wool textile industry. MacArthur's headquarters ordered the Japanese Trade Agency in early November to produce 2.6 million yards of woolen fabrics for export to the Far Eastern market. At the same time, the Economic and Scientific Group of MacArthur's headquarters stated that this woolen fabric will be the lowest-priced export product produced by Japan after the war. It is generally expected that Japanese industrial products, with the support of MacArthur, will flow to China in a continuous stream in the future, and the types and quantities will inevitably increase. According to Shanghai wool textile industrialists, China's wool textile industry is still in its infancy, and the number of wool spindles is pitifully small. Even the China Textile Company, which monopolizes most of the industry through bureaucratic capital, has only 200,000 spindles, and most of them are damaged and still in the repair stage. In contrast, Japan had a total of 1.38 million wool spindles before the war, and still retains 480,000 spindles, of which 320,000 spindles can be fully operational immediately. Moreover, the Japanese wool textile industry can obtain a continuous supply of raw materials. The US military is providing Japan with military supplies, and MacArthur has approved the import of 350,000 bales of wool. Under these circumstances, it will be difficult for China's wool textile industry to gain a foothold.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, a French news agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 1st: Japanese "influential figures" expressed satisfaction with the Pauley reparations plan announced on the 29th of last month, because the strength that the plan allows Japan to retain is still sufficient to dominate the Far East. These people said that although the plan caused Japan to lose three-quarters of its steel, iron, and machine tools, and eliminated its merchant ships, Japan's potential for trade in the Far East remained almost unchanged. They revealed the bold statement that Japan will rise again, saying that Japan's future lies in Far Eastern trade. Japan's remaining industry not only guarantees its people an adequate standard of living, but can also supply finished products to other Asian countries that cannot afford to buy American goods. Japan will especially maintain the textile industry and will continue to export cotton goods to the entire Far East. The "correct" provision in the reparations plan for the tonnage of Japanese merchant ships (a total of 1.5 million tons, of which 250,000 tons are specifically for trade with China and the Philippines) will allow Japan to conduct its Far Eastern trade. They also said that the Japanese are not sorry for the industrial equipment being paid as reparations to China and the Philippines. Because, first, even if China uses Japanese equipment, it will be difficult to compete with Japan because China's situation is unstable, which is not conducive to investment; second, Japan's equipment is already outdated and mostly damaged, so it is happy to give it away and hopes to import new equipment from the United States. They believe that the reparations are only a minor surgery for Japan, and the "success" of the surgery will ensure the future revival of the Japanese economy.

### 在麦克阿瑟卵翼下  日本工业将东山再起  我国民族资本家受严重威胁

　　在麦克阿瑟卵翼下
    日本工业将东山再起
    我国民族资本家受严重威胁
    【新华社延安二十一日电】沪讯：自麦克阿瑟宣布准许日本毛织物重销远东之消息发表后，曾引起此间中国民族工业界极大激动，咸认此为我国僵直之民族工业首先是毛纺织业的警号。麦克阿瑟总部系于上月初命令日本贸易厅生产呢绒毛织品二百六十万码，以备输出远东市场。同时，麦氏总部经济科学组声明，此项呢绒将属日本战后最低之出口用制品。一般预料，日本工业品由于麦克阿瑟的支持，今后势将源源倾至中国，且其种类与数量必将与日俱增。据沪上毛纺织业家称：中国毛纺织业尚在草创时代，毛纺丝为数少得可怜。即就垄断该业大部之官僚资本的中纺公司而言，亦仅有二十万锭，且多破坏，尚在修理阶段。反观日本，则战前共拥有一百三十八万毛纺锭子，现仍保有四十八万锭，其中三十二万锭立刻可以全部转动，并且日本毛纺织业可源源获原料供应，美军以军甲物资接济日本，而麦克阿瑟则已批准输入羊毛三十五万包。在此情形下，中国毛纺织业决难立足。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据天津大公报载法国新闻处东京一日讯：日本“有地位人士”对上月二十九日公布之鲍莱赔偿计划表示满意，因该计划所准许日本保留之力量仍足制霸远东。这些人士说该计划虽使日本丧失其钢、铁及机械工具四分之三，且消灭其商船数目，但日本对远东贸易之潜力几乎保持不动。他们透露日本将东山再起之豪语，说日本之前途系于远东贸易。日本之剩余工业不仅保证其人民之适当生活水准，且可以制成品供给亚洲其他无力购买美货之国家。日本将特别保持纺织业，并将继续向整个远东输出棉货。赔偿计划中“正确”规定日本商船之吨位（共一百五十万吨，其中二十五万吨专供对中国及菲律滨贸易租用），以便日本进行其远东贸易。他们又说：日本人对于赔偿中菲等国的工业设备，亦不以为憾。因为，第一，中国即使利用日本设备，亦难与日本竞争。因中国局势不安定，不利于投资；第二，日本之设备早嫌陈旧，多已损蚀，自乐于出让而希望自美国输入新设备。他们认为，赔偿对于日本不过略施小小手术，手术之“成功”，将确保日本经济未来之复兴。
