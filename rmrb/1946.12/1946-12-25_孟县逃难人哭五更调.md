　　The Lament of Refugees from Meng County
    A Five Watch Tune
    Lu Guangji

    This piece was created by a group of new soldiers from the Meng County Independent Battalion last winter, each contributing a line, singing about the experiences of the people of Meng County after Zhang Bohua's "new-old collaboration" with the Japanese and the occupation by the Chiang's army. When refugees sang it on the stages in the city, and in the villages of Guo and Wei, many in the audience wept. It's now widely circulated. I recorded it when a child named Xing Baisan sang it in Hanzhuang.

    When Zhang Bohua and the "Army of National Subjugation" (a modified pronunciation of "stubborn army" by the masses) wearing American hats and wielding American weapons came to wreak havoc on Meng County again, look at this piece, and you'll understand how indignant the people of Meng County are now. This sings of Meng County, but it might as well sing of the suffering of peasants throughout the Chiang-controlled areas.
    
    First watch sounds, refugees cry in the streets,
    No food in their bellies, no clothes on their backs,
    Alas, my family! Truly suffering,
    Ah, hey yo, truly suffering,
    Walk past Wulicun, and on to Shilipu,
    The whole family walks all day, less than thirty li,
    My legs ache, my back is sore, and all they do is weep.
    Ah, hey yo, (repeat)
    The sun sets in the west, walking all day long,
    A thousand days are good at home, but it's always hard to be away,
    No food, no drink, who cares about my plight, it's truly pitiful,
    Ah, hey yo, (repeat)

    Second watch opens, the whole family flees away,
    Alas, Zhang Bohua, he has betrayed his conscience,
    Levying grain and imposing taxes, only to kill the people.
    Ah, hey yo (repeat) (Note)
    The more I think, the more sorrowful I become, Zhang Xunming is also wicked,
    Looting things, burning houses, killing people like cutting vegetables,
    Merchants and traders! Strangled and even buried alive.
    Ah, hey yo, (repeat)
    Father thinks of son who doesn't return, wife waits for husband who doesn't come,
    Selling property, a few coins, asking him to run a business,
    Passing through his third district territory! He's intercepted and returns empty-handed.
    Ah, hey yo, (repeat)
    (Note: Zhang Bohua was the stubborn county magistrate, Zhang Xunming was the stubborn third district head)
    
    Third watch drums, the whole family's eyes are filled with tears,
    How hateful are those Baojia chiefs, acting so poorly,
    Demanding ten for every one assigned! Only to force the people to ruin.
    Ah, hey yo, (repeat)
    Meng County suffers drought and famine, no grain has been harvested for three years,
    Plagued by insects, plagued by drought, the common people suffer from hunger,
    You don't think of ways to provide relief! And still go to the countryside to seize grain.
    Ah, hey yo, (repeat)
    You plunder Gou Village, you plunder temple lands,
    West Guo Village, Yeshu Street, all the grain is plundered,
    Business is impossible! So we close our doors.
    Ah, hey yo (repeat)

    Fourth watch rings, the whole family is half asleep,
    How hateful are those who act as traitors, not born of human parents,
    The common people provide them with food and clothing! Yet they still go to the countryside to commit violence.
    Ah, hey yo (repeat)
    The western villages suffer drought, the eastern villages are flooded,
    Suffering drought, being flooded, every family is afflicted,
    The officials don't provide relief! And still send people to press for grain every day...
    Grass roots are all eaten, wheat seedlings must also be tasted.
    Wild rice stems, goose droppings, tree bark are all eaten,
    The hungry are eating people! Young girls flee to other villages.
    Ah, hey yo (repeat)
    
    Fifth watch sounds, the whole family wakes up,
    Japanese devils, defeated in battle, withdraw from Chinese territory,
    The "Army of National Subjugation" doesn't resist the war, and comes to seize the county seat again.
    Ah, hey yo (repeat)
    The Political Consultative Conference has a decision, the whole country must have peace,
    Chiang Kai-shek doesn't implement it, there are gunshots and cannon fire everywhere,
    Causing our China, no one can have peace.
    Ah, hey yo (repeat)
    People say the Eighth Route Army, respects the common people,
    Reducing rent and interest, helping to turn the tables, the poor can make a living.
    I am determined to enter the border region! To see the new scenery.
    Ah, hey yo (repeat)

　　孟县逃难人
    哭五更调
    路光辑
    这篇东西，是孟县独立营一群新战士，在去冬开始学习时，你一句我一句凑成的，唱的是张伯华与日本实行“新老合作”及蒋军占领后孟县人民的遭遇。当逃难人在城里，虢村、尉氏各村戏台上唱出时，观众们为之啼哭者很多。现在到处流传，我就是在韩庄一个小孩行百三唱时记录的。
    当着张伯华与“亡国军”（群众对顽固军的改音）戴着美国帽子，拿着美国武器又来糟踏孟县时，看看这篇东西，你就会想到孟县人民现在是怎样愤慨了。这唱的是孟县，但也无妨说唱出了整个蒋管区农民的痛苦。
    一更鼓儿初，逃难人大街哭，
    肚里头，没有食，身上没有衣服，
    可怜我一家人呀！实在真是受苦，
    哪哼嗳哟，实在真受苦，
    走过五里屯，又到十里铺，
    全家人走一天，不到三十里路，
    腿疼我腰又酸呀，大小只是啼哭。
    哪哼嗳哟，（重句）
    太阳落西山，行走整一天，
    在家里千日好，出门时时难，
    没吃没喝呀，谁问我真是可怜，
    哪哼嗳哟，（重句）
　
    二更豉儿开，全家人逃在外，
    可怜那张伯华他把良心坏，
    派粮又派款呀，才把人民杀害。
    哪哼嗳哟（重句）（注）
    越想越悲哀，张洵明也很坏，
    抢东西，烧房屋，杀如人刀切菜，
    买卖客商人呀！勒死还有活埋。
    哪哼嗳哟，（重句）
    父想子不归，妻盼夫不来，
    卖房产，几个钱，叫他去跑买卖，
    路过他三区地呀！被截他空身回来。
    哪哼嗳哟，（重句）
    （注：张伯华是顽县长，张洵明是顽三区区长）
　
    三更鼓儿响，全家人泪汪汪，
    可恨那保甲长，办事太不良，
    派一个要十个呀！才把那人民逼光。
    哪哼嗳哟，（重句）
    孟县遭旱荒，三年没收粮，
    遭虫灾、遭旱灾，老百姓闹饥荒。
    你不想法来救济呀！还要下乡抢粮。
    哪哼嗳哟，（重句）
    缑村你也抢，庙地你也抢，
    西虢村、冶戍街，粮食都抢光，
    生意没法办呀！才把门来关上。
    哪哼嗳哟（重句）
　
    四更鼓儿铮，全家人睡朦胧，
    可恨那当汉奸，不是他爹娘生，
    老百姓供吃穿呀！他还要下乡行凶。
    哪哼嗳哟（重句）
    西乡遭旱荒，东乡水淹光，
    遭旱荒，水淹光，家家遭灾殃，
    当官的不救济呀！还天天派人催粮……。
    草根都吃光，麦苗也得尝。
    茭茭心，大雁屎，树皮都吃光，
    饿的人吃人呀！大闺女逃到外乡。
    哪哼嗳哟（重句）
　
    五更鼓儿鸣，全家人都睡醒，
    日本鬼，吃败仗，退出我中国境，
    “亡国军”不抗战呀，又来抢夺县城。
    哪哼嗳哟（重句）
    政协会有决定，全国都要和平，
    蒋介石不执行，到处是枪炮声，
    搞得咱中国呀，谁也不能太平。
    哪哼嗳哟（重句）
    人家说八路军，敬的是老百姓，
    减租减息，助翻身，穷苦人活得成。
    我下决心进边区呀！看看那新光景。
    哪哼嗳哟（重句）
