(Taiyue, 10th dispatch) Liberated peasants from seven counties, including Yangcheng, Gaoping, Qinshui, Wangwu, Wenxi, Xiaxian, and Yuanqu, participated in the counter-offensive battle for Yuanqu city with unparalleled excitement. Gaoping is 360 li away from Yuanqu and requires traversing several mountains. They enthusiastically rushed to Wangwu ahead of schedule. The stretcher team from Zhao Village, led by Zhao Shenglian, the head of the militia, rushed to the front line on the night of the 4th after receiving the notice. When the stretcher team from the village set off, Wang Youning, a tenant farmer who had just been liberated and received fifteen acres of land, had sores on his leg, but insisted on joining the stretcher team. He said, "These sores don't matter. If we don't beat Chiang Kai-shek back, I won't be able to take care of my sores in peace." The stretcher team from Yangcheng carried lanterns on each stretcher to facilitate traversing the mountains at night. One squad (composed of four stretchers) carried a rifle to cover the wounded through dangerous areas or to rescue the wounded on the front lines. The entire battalion was also equipped with some armed personnel to facilitate independent operations on the front lines. When the first cannon fire sounded, seven hundred stretchers had arrived on the front line on time. In addition, three militia long-distance transport teams participated in front-line activities. The 40,000 liberated peasants in Yuanqu were even more excited. In addition to the entire militia force rushing to the front lines, they organized semi-able-bodied women and children into temporary mutual aid groups to support the front lines, carrying out work such as grinding flour, milling rice, and chopping firewood. The forty-five semi-able-bodied people in Luotuo Kiln formed five groups. Due to their high level of enthusiasm after liberation, they completed ten days of work in five days, milling over a thousand catties of rice and grinding over a thousand catties of flour each. More than thirty refugees living in Dongzan Village and Shangmao Village also actively participated in supporting the front lines. Nine women ground a thousand catties of flour in twenty-four hours. On the 2nd, Deng Kunyu, director of the Armed Forces Committee of Xia Mao Village, and seven other village cadres coordinated with the troops to approach Yuanqu to scout out the enemy situation. Liu Kerang, an old farmer from Jin Sheng Village, was sixty years old. In principle, he could only participate in the elderly group, but he objected, saying, "I'm not old, I can do anything, count me among the young people." When the war was raging in the suburbs of Yuanqu city and in Zhaili, the people of Yuanqu, fearing that the soldiers would go hungry, steamed 37,000 catties of steamed buns and delivered them to the front lines, braving the artillery fire.

    垣曲光复之役
    数万农民热烈参战
    【太岳十日电】阳城、高平、沁水、王屋、闻喜、夏县，垣曲等七县翻身农民，以无比的兴奋参加反攻垣曲城战役。高平距垣曲三百六十里，又须翻越几座大山。他们热情的提前赶至王屋。赵寨村的担架队由自卫队长赵盛连率领，接到通知后于四日深夜即赶到前线。该村担架队出发时，刚刚翻身分得十五亩土地的佃户王有宁，腿上生疮，仍非参加担架队不行。他说：“这点疮不碍事，不把蒋介石打回去，咱养疮也不得安心”。阳城的担架队为便利黑夜翻山架岭，每个担架带有灯笼。一个班（四付担架编成）带有一支步枪，以便掩护伤员通过危险地带，或到火线上抢救伤员。全大队又配备一部分武装，便于在前线上单独活动。前线响起第一炮时，七百付担架已经准时到达前线。另有三个民兵远行队，参加前线活动。垣曲四万翻身农民更是兴奋，除民兵全劳力奔赴前线外，将半劳力妇女儿童组织成临时支援前线的互助小组，进行磨面、碾米，砍柴等工作。骆驼窑四十五个半劳力，组成的五个小组，由于翻身后高度热情，五天即完成了十天的任务，碾米磨面各一千多斤，住在东赞村、上亳村的三十余难民，亦积极参加支援前线，九个妇女二十四个钟头磨面一千斤。二日下亳村武委会主任邓昆玉等七个村干部协同部队，接近垣曲侦察敌情。近圣村老农刘克让年高六十，照理只能参加老年组，但他提出反对意见说：“我不算老，甚都能干，我算在青年人的数”。当战争在垣曲城郊、寨里激烈进行时，垣曲人民唯恐战士受饿，蒸好三万七千斤馍，冒着炮火送到火线上。
