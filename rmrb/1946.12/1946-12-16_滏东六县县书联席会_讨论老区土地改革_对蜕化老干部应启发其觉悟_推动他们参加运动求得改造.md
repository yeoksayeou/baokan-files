[This dispatch from Weixian, December 14th] The Handan Prefecture Fourth District Party Committee convened a joint meeting of the Party Secretaries of the six counties of Handan Eastern - Nangong, Weixian, Pingxiang, Xinhe, Julu, and Guangzong - in late November to study the mass movement issue. All six counties are old liberated areas (the areas around the cities are newly liberated areas). After two previous movements, the masses were still not fully mobilized, and land reform was not thoroughly implemented. After four or five days of discussion, it was decided to immediately launch a large-scale review and rectification movement to thoroughly mobilize the masses and realize "land to the tiller." Based on the actual situation, the areas are broadly divided into three types: (1) In some poor villages, although feudal exploitation has been eliminated, the land problems of poor peasants have not been completely resolved. If these problems can be solved through joint struggle or from public temple lands, they should continue to be resolved. If there are no such conditions, the focus should shift to production. (2) In areas around cities such as Nangong, it was decided to proceed according to the methods used in newly liberated areas. (3) In general old liberated areas, it is necessary to re-mobilize the masses to thoroughly resolve the land issue. During the meeting, there was a heated debate about the old organizations. Some advocated taking care of their past contributions through the old organizations, while others listed facts of the old organizations hindering mass mobilization and advocated not working through them. After repeated study, everyone reached a unified understanding: the essence of the problem is the failure to truly follow the mass line, not a question of whether or not to work through them. The correct approach to the old organizations, old activists, village cadres, militia, and party members should be based on a perspective of care and protection. It should not be an attitude of hatred and detestation, nor can it solely rely on persuasion and education from the leadership. Instead, it should be to inspire them to consciously participate in the mass movement and serve the masses in the movement, so that they can be transformed and educated under the promotion of mass awareness. The core leadership in the villages should be generated in the movement, and a Turn-Over Committee can be organized to lead the land reform movement. At the same time, it is necessary to seize the opportunity of everyone becoming aware and thoroughly resolve the long-standing internal factional struggles that have not been resolved for several years. This will enable the masses to not only thoroughly liberate themselves economically and politically, but also to thoroughly liberate themselves ideologically, and the cadres will also be ideologically transformed. In order to avoid detours in this movement, the leadership further emphasized the need to deeply study policies, especially the policies towards the middle peasants, and to adopt a thorough and meticulous work style.

　　滏东六县县书联席会
    讨论老区土地改革
    对蜕化老干部应启发其觉悟
    推动他们参加运动求得改造
    【本报威县十四日电】冀南四分区于上月下旬，地委召开滏东南宫、威县、平乡、新河、巨鹿、广宗六县县书联席会，研究群众运动问题。六县全系老区（城周为新区），经过二次运动，群众仍未充分发动起来，土地改革亦未彻底实现，经过四五天讨论，决议马上进行翻身大检查运动，彻底发动群众，实现“耕者有其田”。根据实际情况，大体分为三种类型的地区：一、某些贫村封建剥削虽已消灭，但贫农土地问题尚未完全解决，能从联合斗争或公庙地中解决者继续解决之，无此条件者即转入生产。（二）南宫等城周决定按新区办法搞。（三）一般老区则须重新发动群众，彻底解决土地问题。会上对于老组织问题，发生了热烈的争论，有的主张通过老组织照顾他们的功劳，有的列举老组织阻碍发动群众的事实，主张不通过。大家反复研究以后统一了认识：问题的本质是没有真正走群众路线，不是通过不通过的问题；对老组织，老积极分子，村干部、民兵、党员的正确方法，应从爱护观点出发，既不是憎恶痛绝的态度，也不能单靠从领导上说服教育，而是启发他们自觉参加群众运动，在运动中为群众服务，以便在群众觉悟的推动下，得到改造和教育。村里的领导核心，应在运动中产生，可组织翻身委员会领导土地改革运动。同时要抓紧大家觉悟起来的时机，把几年来没有解决了的内部宗派斗争等悬案，彻底解决。使群众不但从经济上、政治上翻透身，而且要从思想上翻透身，干部也要从思想上得到改造。为了此次运动中不再走湾路，领导上更强调提出要深刻研究政策，特别中农政策，作风要深入细致。
