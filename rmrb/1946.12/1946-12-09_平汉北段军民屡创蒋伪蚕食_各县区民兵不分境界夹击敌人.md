Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 6th. The soldiers and civilians on the front line of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway have repeatedly frustrated the "nibbling" incursions of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops. More than a hundred Chiang's troops from the Hebei Security Column and the Ling壽 Zhengding puppet "Homecoming Corps" invaded and occupied our Han Jialou and Wang Jia Zhuang on the 11th of last month. That night, they were fiercely besieged and annihilated by a certain unit of the local Eighth Route Army. Occupying Han Jialou, the Chiang's puppet troops tried to break through several times without success. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 13th, all the Chiang's troops were wiped out. A total of more than 500 people, including the captain of the "Homecoming Corps," were killed, and more than 50 Chiang's county magistrates of Ling壽, etc., were captured alive, and two light machine guns, more than 100 rifles, and 12 short guns were seized. The Chiang's puppet troops occupying other villages and towns and stationed at the Zhou Jiazhuang stronghold fled one after another. At this moment, a large area of the west bank of the 嵯沱 River has been liberated again. In the middle of last month, the militia of Zhengding, Pingshan, and Xingtang counties launched 39 fierce battles with the "nibbling" Chiang's puppet troops, annihilating 147 of them, blowing up a military vehicle, and seizing a large number of supplies. In the battle, the militia in various places broke through the boundaries of counties and districts and supported each other, making it impossible for the invading Chiang's troops to escape the encirclement and attack. On the 7th of last month, 2,000 Chiang's troops from Zhengding surrounded Zili Village in Xinle. After the village militia fought bravely for a day and night, the Xingtang militia rushed to the scene and launched a joint attack from inside and outside. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and fled in defeat. In this battle, more than 30 Chiang's troops were killed and wounded.
