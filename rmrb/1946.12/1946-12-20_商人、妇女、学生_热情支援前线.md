　　Merchants, Women, and Students
    Enthusiastically Support the Front Lines

    Students from Liyi No. 1 High School previously donated money and books to comfort the front lines. Recently, to celebrate Commander-in-Chief Zhu's birthday, they organized four propaganda teams to solicit donations in Chengguan, Xia Guihua, Tu Ling, and other villages. In three days, they raised more than 20,000 yuan and sixteen books. The masses happily said: "Buying books and newspapers for our troops is celebrating Commander-in-Chief Zhu's birthday!"
    After discussing and urgently mobilizing to defend the border area, women in Lijia Gou, Wuxiang, actively donated money to buy weapons for the militia. Wang Molan and Wang Ruxiang each donated 800 yuan, and 63 women in the village donated 9,700 yuan and six kilograms of millet.
    The militiamen in Yuzhou Village, Pingshun, are actively studying and progressing rapidly. Team member Wang Fazhe, in addition to production, carries a homemade gun and hunts pigeons and other wild birds every day to practice shooting. On the morning of the 18th of last month, he shot and killed eight pigeons with one shot. Under his influence, a self-study competition is sweeping the village.
    Under the leadership of the democratic government, the reformed prisoners in Changzhi Detention Center actively participate in production. Since July, they have achieved self-sufficiency in production. Recently, when studying current affairs, everyone deeply hated Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Yan'an and unanimously agreed to save on production and donate more than 700 kilograms of millet to support the front lines.
    Chairman Zhang of the Changzhi Taihang Chamber of Commerce recently called on merchants throughout the region to resolutely not sell foreign goods, promote the use of local goods, prosper the market, consolidate finance, and serve rural production in their operations. In addition, he urged them to emulate the wartime lifestyle of the military and civilians in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, endure hardships, change from eating white flour once a day to every other day, and switch from smoking cigarettes to smoking water pipes, saving on food and clothing for the victory of the self-defense war.
    The masses in Tongtan, Zuoquan County, enthusiastically treated the wounded and sick soldiers. On the 20th of last month, when more than 200 wounded and sick soldiers transferred from Matian passed through Tongtan Town, Mayor Shen Wenkui immediately mobilized merchants, the masses, and women throughout the town to offer condolences. The teachers and students of San Gao donated more than 1,800 Jichaos, bought cigarettes and matches to send to the wounded and sick soldiers, and more than 30 students cooperated with more than 70 women to serve soup and water to the wounded and sick soldiers, and offered cordial condolences. Women Li Gaichi, Xu Lianmei, Jin Wuhao, and Liu Fuqiao ignored their meals to serve water to the wounded and sick soldiers, helped carry stretchers, and solved the food problems of the laborers. Li Lianlin of the United Cooperative boiled two large pots of noodle soup, and Shang Beifang boiled two pots of mutton soup. Noodle soup, sesame cakes, sesame candy, cigarettes, and other items were constantly stuffed into the hands of the wounded and sick soldiers. The wounded and sick soldiers gratefully said: There were receptions along the villages from Shexian, and Tongtan Town gave the best reception.

　　商人、妇女、学生
    热情支援前线
    黎城一高学生前曾献金捐书慰劳前线，近为给朱总司令祝寿又组织四个宣传队于城关、下桂花、土苓等村进行劝募，三天内募洋两万余元，书籍十六册。群众们高兴的说：“给咱队伍买书报就是给咱朱总司令祝寿哩！”
    武乡栗家沟妇女经讨论紧急动员起来保卫边区后，纷纷自动捐洋给民兵买武器。王磨兰、王如香各捐洋八百元，全村妇女六十三人捐了九千七百元及小米六斤。
    平顺峪村民兵积极自学进步甚快，队员王发则每天除生产外，背着土枪天天打鸽子等野禽，练习射击。上月十八日晨一枪即打死八个鸽子，在他影响下，全村正掀起自学竞赛。
    长治看守所自新人在民主政府领导下，积极参加生产，从七月份起已做到生产自给，日前学习时事对蒋介石进攻延安大家非常痛恨，一致通过生产节约，捐出七百余斤小米，全部支援前线。
    长治太行商联总会张主席，顷号召全区商人除在经营上坚决不卖外货、倡用土货、繁荣市场、巩固金融、服务于农村生产外，效法陕甘宁边区军民生活战时化，吃苦耐劳，把每日吃白面一顿，改为隔日一顿，吸纸烟改为吸水烟，节衣缩食，为着自卫战争的胜利。
    左权县桐滩群众热情招待伤病员。上月二十日由麻田转送之伤病员二百余人，路过桐滩镇时，镇长申文魁立即发动全镇商人、群众、妇女进行慰问。三高师生献出冀钞千八百余元，买成纸烟火柴送给伤病员，三十多个学生配合七十余个妇女给伤病员端汤送水，并亲切慰问。妇女李改池、许连梅、靳五好、刘福巧等不顾吃饭招呼伤病员喝水，帮助抬担架，给民夫解决饮食困难。联合社李连林烧了两大锅面条汤，商北方熬了两锅羊汤，面汤、烧饼、麻糖、烟卷等不断地塞到伤病员手里。伤病员同志们都感激的说：从涉县来沿村都有招待，桐滩镇招待得最好。
