　　[Our Dispatch from Changzhi, 5th] In order to strike at Chiang's troops' new offensives, our Daokou-Qinghua Railway main force corps, at the end of last month, with the speed of a thunderbolt, crossed the Daokou-Qinghua Railway and advanced to the banks of the Yellow River. On the 29th and 30th, they successively recovered important strongholds of Chiang's troops between Qin (yang), Wen (xian), and Wu (zhi), such as Mulou, Yanglei, Shangxiang, Taocun, Dasima, and Dahongqiao. On the 2nd, at dawn, they recovered the county seat of Wenxian, seriously threatening the rear of Chiang's troops advancing north in Puyang. The offensive is now expanding.

　　[Our Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Frontline, 4th] Following the recovery of Juancheng, Yuncheng was also recovered by our Songjiang Detachment local corps and militia at 2 PM on the 3rd. Thus, there are no traces of the enemy north of the He (ze)-Ju (ye) highway, making the Chiang Fifth Army and other troops invading Puyang even more isolated. Our democratic government personnel entered the city with the army and immediately went to comfort the families of citizens killed by Chiang's troops and implement emergency relief. Since the city was occupied by Chiang's troops on October 14th, our army and civilians have been besieging it, constantly killing and wounding the enemy. This time, in the victory at Hua County, Chiang's army's predicament of insufficient forces was fully exposed. The 75th Division, entrenched in the city, fled back to Juye in a panic, leaving only the puppet security regiment and special agent forces such as the Home Return Corps still trying to hold on. They were finally annihilated under the active attacks of our army and civilians, and Yuncheng was liberated again. The results of the battle are being verified.

　　孤立濮阳北犯蒋军我军光复温县郓城
    【本报长治五日电】为打击蒋军新的进犯，我道清主力兵团，于上月底以迅雷不及掩耳之势，横跨道清路，挺进黄河岸，二十九、三十日先后收复沁（阳）温（县）武（陟）间木楼、杨垒、上香、陶村、大司马、大虹桥等蒋军重要据点后，二日拂晓光复温县县城，严重威胁濮阳北犯蒋军后方，现攻势正在扩展中。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线四日电】继鄄城光复之后，三日午后二时郓城又为我宋江支队地方兵团及民兵所恢复，至此，荷（泽）巨（野）公路以北已无敌踪，使进犯濮阳蒋第五军等益形孤立。我民主政府工作人员随军入城，当即分头慰问被蒋军杀害之市民家属，施行紧急救济。该城自十月十四日为蒋军侵占后，我军民即进行围困，不断杀伤敌人。此次滑县大捷，蒋军兵力不足的窘态毕露，盘据城内之七十五师仓惶窜回巨野，仅余伪保安团及还乡团等特务武装犹图固守，终在我军民积极打击下，宣告溃灭，郓城遂重获解放。战果正清查中。
