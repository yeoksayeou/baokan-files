　　【This newspaper's correspondent group on the JiluYu Front, 17th dispatch】A certain company of a certain unit is very good at combining current affairs education with ideological education. Once, they discussed the issue of the civil war and individual future, and the debate was extremely heated. During mealtime, an old man, a military dependent who had fled from Cao County, also participated in the discussion. He pushed a small cart with a child lying on it. He recounted the atrocities committed by Chiang's army and the "Returning Home Corps" against the common people, and sighed repeatedly: "Where can we go?!" This gave everyone a great revelation. At this time, the propaganda team clerk returned from Xiaotunji, bringing back a message saying: "There are many refugees from Dingtao and Cao County in the market. According to them: the 'Returning Home Corps' is the most hateful, demanding forty catties of wheat per mu, forcing many young people to flee, most of whom joined the People's Liberation Army." The leadership then consciously allowed the soldiers and masses to discuss these two matters, and everyone's thinking quickly became consistent, reaching a common conclusion: only by resolutely struggling and completely defeating Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy can we protect our homes and obtain a bright future for ourselves. In the struggle, only by not fearing death can everyone live. Without the determination to die, no one can live, and the individual cannot live either.
　　【This newspaper's correspondent group on the JiluYu Front, 14th dispatch】Our frontline troops are seizing all available time to study the Liberation Daily editorial "The War Situation is Beginning to Change." When the JiluYu Daily, which published the editorial, arrived at a certain unit of our frontline troops, the main cadres of the unit were holding a meeting. The editorial was immediately included in the meeting agenda and read aloud by a comrade. After reading it, everyone said that since the Longhai Campaign, under the correct leadership of leaders Liu and Deng, we have more than once made large strides in advance and retreat, "concentrating our forces and annihilating the enemy by means of continuous day and night tenacious fighting." In the future, we must greatly promote this spirit of hard work and tenacity. As the editorial pointed out: "Strive to switch to a counter-offensive." The newspaper carrying the editorial was quickly forwarded to various units, along with a notice from the superior political organs, stipulating that all units should seize all available time to organize discussions and raise questions for study, especially in connection with their own thoughts and work. The unit's directly subordinate teams began collective study on the morning of the 11th. (Ding Man)

　　前线我某连进行时事学习
    战士认清不怕死才能活
    将更发扬艰苦顽强精神争取反攻
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十七日电】某部一连，很善于时事教育与思想教育结合进行。有一次他们讨论内战与个人前途问题，争论极为热烈，吃饭时，连从曹县逃出的一位军属老汉，也参加讨论了。他推着一辆小车，上面躺着一个小孩，他叙述起蒋军和“还乡队”糟害老百姓的事，连连叹息说：“这该走到那里去？！”给大家很大的启示。这时政工队文书从小屯集回来，带回一个消息说：“集上许多定陶曹县的难民。据他们说：‘还乡队’最可恶，每亩地要四十斤麦子，逼跑了很多青年，大多参加了人民解放军。”领导上便有意识地把这两件事，让战士群众讨论，大家思想很快一致起来，得出一个共同的结论说：只有坚决斗争，彻底打垮蒋介石的内战政策，才能保家和获得个人的光明前途。在斗争中，个人不怕死，才能使大家都能活。没有死的决心，大家都不能活下去，个人也就活不了。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十四日电】前线我军抓紧一切时间学习解放日报社论《战局在开始转变》。当刊载该社论的冀鲁豫日报到达前线我军某部时，该部所属单位主要干部正开会，即将社论列入会议程序内，并由某同志朗读。当读罢时，大家都说自陇海战役以来，我们在刘邓首长正确的领导下，曾不止一次地大踏步进退，“集中兵力，以连续数昼夜顽强战斗的方法，歼灭敌人。”今后还要大大的发扬这种艰苦顽强的战斗精神。如社论中所指出的：“尽力转入反攻”。刊登该社论之报纸，迅速地被转送到各单位去。并附有上级政治机关的通知，规定各单位抓紧一切时间，组织讨论，提出问题研究。特别要联系到自己的思想和工作，该部直属队并于十一日晨开始集体学习。（丁曼）
