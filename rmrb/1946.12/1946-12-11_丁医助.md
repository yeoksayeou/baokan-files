    Medical Assistant Ding
    Yong Jin
    At the age of twelve, Ding Yousan joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. He has the characteristics of the Red Army. After becoming a medical assistant, no matter what battle it was, he would always follow the assault team to the front lines to rescue the wounded. During the Huiming campaign this year, he suffered two serious injuries to his arm and became a second-class disabled person. In the Hua County campaign, he again went with the assault team into the wooden fort at Lao'an, despite his injuries. With enemy and our artillery fire crisscrossing, he rescued the wounded from under the trajectory of the bullets. He nervously bandaged the wounded, and when he bandaged the fourth one, his hand was cut by a piece of shrapnel. He ignored his own bleeding and continued to rescue the wounded warriors. When his first aid kit was used up, he took off his own bandages, and also took off the bandages of other comrades. All the wounded inside the wooden fort were bandaged one by one before he took a deep breath. The artillery fire was so fierce that it deafened his ears, but he led several slightly wounded comrades and safely retreated to the ditch of our army's position.

    丁医助
    勇进
    二十五年，丁友三才十二岁，就参加了中国工农红军。他有着红军的特色。他当医助以后，不管那次战斗，总要跟着突击队到最前面去，抢救伤员。今年惠明战役时，他的膀子两处重伤，成了二等残废。滑县战役，他又带着伤和突击队突到老岸的木砦里边去。敌我的炮火交炽着，他从弹道下边去抢救伤员，他紧张的给伤员绑着绷带，绑到第四个时，他的手被一个炸弹皮割破了，他仍不管自己流血，继续抢救着负伤的勇士们。他的救急包用完了，就把自己的绑带解下来，把其他同志的绑带也解下来，所有木砦里面的伤员，一个个都绑好了，他才深深喘了口气。炮火是那样的激烈，把他的耳朵震聋了，但他领着几个轻伤同志，安全地撤到我军阵地的水沟里。
