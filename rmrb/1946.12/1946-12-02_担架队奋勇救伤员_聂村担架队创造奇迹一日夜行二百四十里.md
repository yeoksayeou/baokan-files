　　After a night of fierce fighting, the general attack on the invading army that had penetrated into Shangguan Village, Hua County, began. Section Chief Ma of the × unit brought new information: "The task is heavy, and there are not enough stretchers!" So the members of the Puyang stretcher team busily disassembled two stretchers (a total of twelve people) into three. Some team members went to the village to find door panels, and more than a dozen other stretchers scrambled to the front lines. Bomb fragments fell all around them, and bullets whistled overhead, making the stretchers seem particularly cumbersome. Section Chief Ma carefully directed them to avoid the enemy's firing points. They suddenly squatted by the base of the wall outside the village, then abruptly crossed the street, advancing along both sides of the street in Taocun (a small village east of Shangguan Village) towards Shangguan Village. The enemy's machine guns frantically swept the street. When they turned and walked to the hidden first-aid station at the south end of the street, the eagerness to rescue the wounded overcame the fear in their hearts, and they rushed non-stop towards the village wall. Zhang Sanling and his second brother, Shuling; Yin Tianhai and old Zhang; Cao Wuni and Guan Jin'e, two people carried each wounded soldier. The shooting was intense, and armed comrades waved their hands and shouted, "Comrades, take a break before going on." But they insisted on completing their task. Yin Tianhai and Cao Wuni rushed back to the front line to rescue their second and third wounded soldiers. "We've broken into the village!" The news of victory was like adding fuel to the fire, and the stretcher team members were even more excited and forgot the danger of the battlefield, following the combat troops and running straight into the village. The eighteen-year-old stretcher team members Du Youyuan and Du Xiaoyuan, winding their way through one gap after another, approached the large blockhouse finally occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and carried a wounded soldier down from the gate tower, which was still smoldering. Du Youyuan was carrying the wounded soldier in front, and Du Xiaoyuan was looking after him from the side. In the darkness, a brick almost tripped Du Youyuan. Fearing that the wounded soldier would fall on the brick, he simply lay flat on the ground and then slowly got up. From the blockhouse in the center of the village to the × unit's first-aid station was at least three li. Qi Huaiyu, Qi Huaihe, and Hu Shiquan from Qizhuang had already made fourteen round trips, panting and sitting on the ground to rest. They casually chatted, "We don't really count for much. Look at those Eighth Route Army soldiers, their bodies are covered in mud, and their faces are blackened by the artillery fire. Who are they doing it for?!" At this moment, someone shouted, "There are wounded soldiers." They rushed back to the front line. Yin Tianhai, who had been to the front line six times, was walking when a bullet flew and broke the pole on his shoulder. Old Yin's close-fitting jacket was already soaked with sweat, but he did not hesitate and continued to approach the large blockhouse in the center of the village. The wounded soldier he rescued this time was Comrade Li of the × regiment's third company. Just as they walked out of the east end of Taocun, a gust of northwest wind blew, and he softly asked, "Comrade Li, are you uncomfortable anywhere? Are you a little cold?" Putting down the stretcher, Old Yin carefully smoothed the package under Comrade Li's head, and then put his own cotton coat over Comrade Li. "Uncle, you're so kind, I'm not uncomfortable anywhere!" Comrade Li murmured. The stretcher team members were so focused that they forgot to rest. Yin Tianhai and several other stretchers sent the wounded soldiers to the first-aid station. The medics hurried to change the dressing. Before they could be transferred further back, their stretchers arrived again. The wounded comrades excitedly said, "You are really fast!" Old Yin solemnly told everyone, "We walk in small steps, run with our heads swaying, and small steps are steady." The stretcher teams of the first and second platoons encouraged each other, saying, "The third and fourth platoons are so brave on the front line, we must work harder on the transport!" From the front-line surgical team to the rear-area aid station, a long journey of twenty li, each stretcher in the first and second platoons carried three times in one day and night. The stretchers of Nie Village in the second platoon even sent four times. Their shoulders were worn out, and their feet were blistered. The miracle of carrying wounded soldiers 240 li on foot in 24 hours was created by them. A certain unit specially awarded them the title of "Model Stretcher Platoon" and gave them a bonus of 20,000 yuan and two cartons of Victory cigarettes. The letter of commendation stated: "The gifts are few, just a small expression of the respect of all comrades for the heroic participants in the war."

　　担架队奋勇救伤员
    聂村担架队创造奇迹一日夜行二百四十里
    力文
    一夜鏖战之后，对深入我滑县上官村进犯军的总攻击开始了。×部马股长传来了新的情况：“任务繁重，担架不够用！”于是濮阳担架队的队员们忙着将两付担架（共十二人）拆成三付，有的队员到村里去找门板，另外十几付担架都争着上火线，走在最前面的一个是张营村担架队班长雇工主任殷田海。炸弹片纷纷落在身边，子弹叫啸着从头上掠过，担架显得格外的笨重。马股长关心的指挥着他们躲避开敌人的火力点，他们突然蹲在村外的墙根，又猛然跨过街口，顺着陶村（上官村东的小村）街道的两侧，向上官村前进。敌人的机枪向着大街疯狂的扫射着，当他们转身走到街南头隐蔽的火线绷带所时，抢救伤员的热情抵消了心坎的恐惧，他们不停息的冲向寨墙。张三岭和二弟水岭、殷田海和老张、曹五妮和管金娥，两个人背一个彩号。枪打得正紧，武装同志摆着手喊：“老乡们稍停再走。”他们却坚持完成了任务。殷田海曹五妮又重跑上火线，抢背下第二、第三个彩号。“打进围寨啦！”胜利的消息像火上加油，担架队员们更兴奋得忘记了战场上的危险，随着战斗部队，一直跑向寨里去了。十八岁的担架队员杜又元和杜小元，拐湾抹角地穿过一道一道的缺口，接近了蒋军最后占据的大炮楼从烟火未熄的门楼下，背运一位彩号下来。前面背着彩号的是杜又元，杜小元从旁招呼着彩号，黑暗中砖块几乎把杜又元拌了一交，他担心把彩号摔在砖块上，索性平伏在地上，然后慢慢的爬起来。从寨中心炮楼到×部绷带所，至少有三里路，齐庄的齐怀雨、齐怀河、胡世全，已往返了十四趟，气喘喘的坐在地上歇腿，他们随便地闲撩着：“咱这真不算话，看人家八路军混身滚得像个泥人，脸都被炮火熏黑了，人家是为了谁？！”这时不知谁传了声“有伤员。”他们又飞奔上了火线。六次上火线的殷田海正走着，一颗子弹飞来打折了他肩上的杠子，老殷贴身的褂子已是汗淋淋了，他却没有犹豫，继续走近寨中心的大炮楼。这一次抢救的彩号，是×团三连的李同志，刚走出陶村东头，一阵西北风刮过来，他轻声的问：“李同志，你那里不得劲？你有点冷吧？”放下担架，老殷把李同志头底下的包裹仔细的褶平，然后又把自己身上的大袄盖在李同志身上。“老大爷这样好，我没有什么不得劲的地方！”李同志喃喃地说。担架队员们紧张的忘记了休息，殷田海等几付担架把彩号送到绷带组，卫生员赶忙换药，还没有转运下去，他们的担架又来了。伤员同志们兴奋的说：“你们走的真快啊！”老殷一本正经地告诉大家说：“我们是碎步走，快步跑头荡，碎步稳当。”一二中队的担架队见了互相勉励着说：“人家三、四中队上火线那样勇，咱们转运可得多用力啦！”从前方手术组到后方救护站共满二十里的长途，一、二中队一昼夜每付担架都运了三次，二中队聂村的担架更连送四次，他们的肩膀压破了，脚上起了泡，二十四小时内抬着伤员步行二百四十里的奇迹，也正是他们创造出来的。某部特赠给他们以“担架模范连”的称号，并给奖金二万元、胜利纸烟两条。慰问信上写着：“礼物很少，略表全体同志对参战英雄们的敬意。”（记者团二十八日电）
