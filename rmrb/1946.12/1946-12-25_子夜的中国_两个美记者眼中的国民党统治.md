　　China at Midnight
    The Kuomintang Rule in the Eyes of Two American Journalists
    By Theodore H. White and Annalee Jacoby
    Editor's Note: Theodore H. White and Annalee Jacoby are two relatively fair American journalists. The former once visited Yan'an. Here is an excerpt from a chapter in their book "Thunder Out of China." Although still too mild, it illustrates how unsightly Chiang Kai-shek's rule had become in the eyes of foreigners. More excerpts are planned for future publication.
    The internal struggle in China is too often viewed as a simple conflict between two power-hungry parties—the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. But the most basic—and truest—statement about Chinese politics today is that the Chinese people desire a government that will bring them change. Revolution is meant to agitate every province, every county, every village. It makes its demands harshly and directly, encroaching upon everyone's private life. Revolution unfolds among famine-stricken refugees, in every army encampment, in the memories of every soldier trekking across desolate fields towards disaster.
    In the changes that history demands of China, a vast group must lose its privileges, so that another—much larger—group can gain. For centuries, the peasants of China have served as serfs to those who control the land and the government, depleting themselves to a state of despair. For centuries, the cruel and elegant figures who ruled Chinese society have had all the morality, law, and power on their side. The struggle between landowners and the landless, between the well-fed and the starving, is as old as Chinese history. But now, with the injection of new technologies, new doctrines, and new needs, the control of the gentry is threatened for the first time.
    Today, China stands at a critical juncture in history, with its dangers sharp and clear. The first danger is that those who rule the Kuomintang, with their feudal minds, attempt to transfer the rights they have held since ancient times into the new world of tomorrow, just as their old partners in Japan did a century ago. The second danger arising from the Kuomintang's blind resistance to change is that their political enemies may so cleverly cultivate a revulsion against this accumulated sin that the people are willing to reject the freedom that is almost within reach, seeking only to rectify the ancient injustices...
    The greatest danger to peace in China comes from the ruling structure composed of the Kuomintang's right-wing. This structure is a political manifestation of Kuomintang military leaders, feudal landlords, and wartime bureaucrats. These groups have extracted great benefits from the old way of life; for peace to be effective, these people must be forced to make the greatest sacrifices. They control the Kuomintang and the "legitimate" government, recognized solely by the United States. If Chairman Chiang were to suffer any misfortune, they would appoint his successor.
    These groups of the Kuomintang right-wing hold the magic weapon in their hands; the local regulations used in Chinese villages were written by their ancestors, and everything right and wrong is judged by the figures they appoint. In a sense, these people are pitiable, because they guard the splendid relics of Chinese culture, philosophy, and tradition, yet do not understand how to integrate them into the modern world. Under their guardianship, China's political thought has lost all rich content, becoming lifeless and dull. Their record of commanding the war is a series of failures... They cannot provide the social impetus to rally people to struggle forward, because they do not treat people as human beings, but as servile peasants. Their wisdom is devalued into market trickery, and their strength degenerates into the stubbornness of common men.
    The greatest sin of these figures lies not in their corruption, petty tyranny, or cunning, but in their utter incompetence in governance and leadership. After defeating Japan, when the Kuomintang army returned to the coastal areas, this old government group was given one last chance to cleanse and purify itself. The advance units of the Kuomintang army and government were greeted with fluttering flags and parades of citizens in Shanghai and Guangzhou, in a carnival-like atmosphere. But within six months, they not only alienated themselves from the vast masses who were malnourished and powerless, but also from the solid industrial and commercial groups, which had been a huge reservoir of their strength ten years ago.
    It is a rule that the final attribute manifested in the decline of a ruling group is its ability to plunder, oppress, and misgovern. The Kuomintang's return to the coastal areas precisely confirmed this rule. In an atmosphere of rampant inflation and utter moral bankruptcy, these avaricious members from Chongqing returned to loot the liberated cities and provinces. The embezzlement and bribery that had always been tolerated by the morals of the Chinese government became rampant without limit. The people of Shanghai watched with dismay as the government they had welcomed back sold licenses, sold privileges, rotted foreign surplus goods, and condoned hoarding and speculation. They watched as the printing presses churned out rolls of worthless banknotes, while prices soared, and officials danced in nightclubs and drank in luxurious hotels. Shanghai labor groups watched as the Kuomintang convened their first labor group conference in a dance hall. The old black market industry reappeared under the guidance of some of the most powerful figures in the Kuomintang! The people of Shanghai had seen the government's retreat in 1937, bleeding but wearing glory, and it was replaced by the Japanese and puppet traitors, and now this government had returned, but had embraced some of the most hated traitors.
    On the surface, it seems difficult to reconcile the luxury and indulgence of the Kuomintang apparatus with Chairman Chiang's strict, puritanical qualities. But the authority of this apparatus over ordinary party members was approved by Chiang himself at the 1945 Party Congress. The tangible bureaucracy, the tyranny and extortion in the coastal areas, were merely a microcosm of the tyranny and extortion that had existed in the inland rural areas for generations. The old system in the countryside was condoned by traditional practices and concealed by endless years; the local tyrants and evil gentry who formed the largest foundation supporting the Kuomintang, first represented by Chairman Chiang himself, accepted their support, and also covered themselves with their morality. Chiang had to almost go against his intentions (here the two reporters were deceived by Chiang's pretentiousness, Chiang, this rogue's intention is to drink blood, there is no violation. - editor), and work hand in hand with their urban partners - the party hacks, and these people undermined his reliance in the big cities. A wise American politician once made a comment on Chiang, which was also a comment on the entire Kuomintang apparatus. He said: "Chairman Chiang is trying to fight ideas with force; he neither understands ideas nor knows how to use force."
    Therefore, it is simply a historical fallacy to say that the greatest single figure in the equation of peace and war in China today is Chairman Chiang. The right-wing of the Kuomintang trusts no leader other than Chiang Kai-shek; if they need to be persuaded, restrained, or forced to take progressive measures, only Chairman Chiang himself can do it. Only he can assure his feudal followers that they will not be completely eradicated in a new country, and only he can guarantee that a small portion of their former power can be retained.

　　子夜的中国
    两个美记者眼中的国民党统治
    白修德  贾安娜合著
    编者按：白修德和贾安娜（Theodore H·White and Annalee Jacoby）是两位美国较公正的记者，前者曾访问过延安。这里摘录他们合著《中国的暴风雨》中一章的一段，虽然还太温和，但也说明了蒋家统治在外国人士眼中已是如何难看了。以后打算还摘载两段。
    中国内部的斗争太惯常被视为是两个争权政党——国民党和共产党——间的简单冲突。但对今天中国政治之最原始——也最真实——的说法却是中国人民企求的是一个将给予他们以变革的政府。革命是要激荡国内每一省，每一县，每一村落，它以严酷，直接地侵犯每一个人的私生活而提出它的要求。革命在饥馑的难民群中，在每一兵团的宿营地中，在每一个跨越荒山田野而直趋灾难的士兵的记忆中，展开着它的工作。
    在历史所要求于中国的变革中，一个庞大的集团必得丧失它的特权。为了另一个——更庞大得多的——集团能有所得。几世纪以来，中国的农民为那些控制着土地和政府的人们充当农奴，已经把自己消蚀到绝望的境地。几世纪以来，统治中国社会的残酷而文雅的人士在他们这一方有着一切道德，法律和权力的凭依。在拥有田产和贫无立锥者间，在脑满肠肥和忍饥受饿者间的斗争也正像中国历史那样古老。但现在由于新的技术，新的学说，新的需要的注入，豪绅的控制却第一次遭受到威胁。
    今天的中国是站在历史危机的关口，其危险是犀利而明晰的。第一个危险是：那些统治着国民党，头脑封建的人物企图把他们旷古以来便已握有的权利，转入到明日的新世界里去，一如他们在日本的老搭挡在一世纪以前所曾做过的那样。从国民党的盲目抗拒变革中所产生的第二种危险是：他们的政敌，可以这样乖巧地，对这种岁积垒的罪恶培植起一种反感，致使人民竟甘愿把几已伸手可得的自由唾弃，但求古老的不义得予纠正。……
    中国和平最大危险来自国民党的右派所构成的统治机构。这一机构是国民党军事领袖，封建地主，和战争中坐着官僚的政治表现。这些集团曾从陈旧的生活中汲取大的利益；为使和平有效，这些人必须被迫作最大的捐弃。他们控制着国民党和“合法的”、为美国唯一承认的政府。如果蒋主席有个三长两短，他们便将任命他的后继人。
    国民党右派的这些集团，把法宝握在自己手中；通用于中国乡村的地方法规是他们的祖先写下来的，一切的是非也由他们所任命的人物来判断。就某一意义言，这些人是值得怜惜的，因为他们监护着中国文化、哲学和传统的辉煌遗迹，然而并不能了解应如何在那里把这些弄得能编插到现代的世界中去。在他们的监护下，中国的政治思想失去了一切丰富的内容，变为死气沉沉和索然无味。他们指挥战争的成绩是一连串的北……他们不能提供社会的动力，把人集合起来向前奋斗，因为他们把人不当做人，而当做是奴颜婢膝的农民。他们的智慧贬值为市场上的诡谲，他们的坚强沦降为匹夫的执拗。
    这些人物的最大罪恶还不在于他们的贪污，小事情上的暴虐、狡诈，而在于他们对统治和领导的全然无能。在战胜日本，国民党军返沿海一带之后，这旧的政府集团又得到一个洗涤和清除自己的最后机会。国民党军队和政府的前进单位在上海和广州曾受到旌旗飞扬，市民结队的欢迎，这是狂欢节般的盛况。但在六个月间他们不但终于自绝于营养不良，无权无势的广大群众，并且还自绝于坚实的工商业集团，这一集团在十年前原曾是他们力量的巨大贮蓄池。
    这是一种规律，即表现在一统治集团没落的最后属性便是他的抢掠，高压和治国无方的能力。国民党之回到沿海一带恰恰证实了这一规律。在通货高度膨胀，道德全然破产的风气下，重庆的这般贪财无厌的会员们又回来洗劫被解放的城市和省份。为中国政府道德所一向容许的中饱和贿赂，便猖獗到漫无边际了。上海的人民们以难堪的感觉，坐视他们所迎迓回来的政府出售执照，出售特权，霉烂国外的剩余物资，宽宥囤积居奇等事实。他们坐视印刷机滚出一卷卷毫无价值的纸币，而物价却攀腾直上，官僚们在夜总会里跳舞，在华贵的旅馆里饮酒。上海职工团体眼看着国民党在跳舞场里召开他们的第一届职工团体大会。旧有的黑货业，在国民党某些最有权势的人士指导下又抛头露面！上海的人民曾见到一九三七年政府的撤退，流着血但佩着光荣，这政府遂为日本人和伪军汉奸所接替，而现在这个一政府又回来了，但却把某些最令人憎恨的汉奸纳入怀中。
    表面上好像难于把国民党机构的奢侈，放纵和蒋主席的严悛，清教徒式的素质结合起来。但这一机构的权力之凌逾于普通党员却是蒋自己在一九四五年党大会上所批准的。有形的官僚制度，在沿岸一带的暴虐和勒索，原只是多少代以来，便在内地农村中所存在的暴虐和勒索的缩影。农村的旧有制度是传统做法所原宥的，并有无穷的岁月来予以掩饰；形成支撑国民党的最大基础的土豪劣绅们，首先以蒋主席自己为代表，接受了他们的支持，而且自己也罩上了他们的道德观，蒋便必须几乎违反本意的（这里两位记者被蒋的装模作样哄住了，蒋这位流氓的本意就是喝血，并没什么违反。——编者），和他们城市的搭挡们——党棍们携手并进，而这些人便破坏了他在大城市里的依靠。一个贤明的美国政治家，对蒋曾做过的评语也正是对国民党整个机构所做的评语。他说：“蒋主席企图用武力来和思想格斗，他既不懂得思想又不知如何使用武力。”
    因此，说现在中国和平与战争的方程式中，最伟大的单一人物是蒋主席，这简直是历史的谬论。国民党的右派除蒋介石以外，对任何领导都不信任；如果需要规劝，约束或强迫他们采取进步措施的话，这只有蒋主席自己才可以做到。唯有他可以向他的封建扈从们保证，在一个新的国家中，他们不会被完全铲除，只有他可以保证他们以前的权势能保留一小部分。
