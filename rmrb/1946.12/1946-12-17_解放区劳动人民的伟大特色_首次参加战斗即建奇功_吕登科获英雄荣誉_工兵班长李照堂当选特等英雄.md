The Great Characteristics of the Laboring People in the Liberated Areas
	First Time Participating in Battle, Achieve Outstanding Merit
	Lü Dengke Wins the Title of Hero
	Combat Engineer Squad Leader Li Zhaotang Elected Special-Class Hero
[This newspaper's correspondent group on the front lines of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, 15th dispatch] Lü Dengke, one of the 180 heroes led by Regiment Commander Wu Zhong, won the honor of hero in his first battle. This is a great characteristic of the awakened laboring people in the liberated areas. He fought in Zhangfengji (30 li southwest of Juye), fighting across the wall against Chiang Kai-shek's direct line, American-equipped 11th Division, charging repeatedly. When he threw his first grenade at the Chiang army's position, and it didn't explode, he became anxious. Deputy Platoon Leader Zhu Yinshi came over and asked him, "Have you ever thrown one before?" Dengke said, "The squad leader thinks I'm too young and won't let me." Yinshi taught him to pull the fuse first and then throw it. He threw three grenades at the Chiang army position in one go, and they all exploded, driving back the Chiang army's charge. The Chiang army hid behind the position and shouted, "Surrender, little Eighth Router." Dengke was furious, cursing and shouting, "There are no surrendering soldiers in the Eighth Route Army!" When he ran out of grenades and wanted to use his rifle, Dengke fired the shot but forgot to eject the cartridge, and couldn't pull the bolt, becoming anxious and crying. Dengke went to the battalion headquarters to find the battalion commander, who gave him half a steamed bun, and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhu gave him the rifle that the martyr Liu Qin had carried. Little Dengke hadn't even put the bun in his mouth when he picked up his gun and went back into his own fortifications. As soon as he squatted down, a machine gun shot off his hat. Then, three bombs landed near him, one of which blew him up and buried him in the soil. Little Dengke was very clear-headed, however, thinking that the enemy would definitely charge after the shelling, so he quickly climbed out of the soil, aimed his gun at the attacking Chiang army, drove back the Chiang army that was moving forward, and found his hat and put it back on. Then, an American-made Chiang Kai-shek plane flew overhead, and Little Dengke calmly squatted in the position, squinting his eyes to shoot at the plane. An old soldier told him, "Don't expose your target, if you shoot again, I'll beat you!" Lü Dengke grinned and said, "Comrade, you beat the enemy, why are you beating me?"
	After this battle, many cultural workers visited him, wanting to find the "secret of why a new soldier who had only joined the army for a short time became a hero." He replied very cheerfully, "I'm eighteen years old, but I'm short. They said I was too young to join the army! I'm small because my family was poor and I was starved. In the past, when I borrowed one, I had to repay two, and I still had to kowtow to the lender! Only those who lend money hope that the big bad guy Chiang Kai-shek will come. If he comes, I will starve to death. I heard that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking the liberated areas, so I resolutely wanted to join the main force (regular army) to fight this big bad guy. When my mother found out, she also thought I was too young and worried about me joining the main force, so she asked my brother to stop me halfway and take me back. I said, do the brothers, mothers and children want to starve to death or want to live? If you want to live, let me go fight Chiang Kai-shek! My brother had no choice but to cry and go back, and I joined the Eighth Route Army."
[This newspaper's correspondent group on the front lines of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, 14th dispatch] In our siege operations, the role played by combat engineers' explosions is very great. Among the special-class combat heroes recently elected by the × unit, there is a very brave combat engineer squad leader, Li Zhaotang. During the Juan'nan Campaign, the 86th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the Chiang army was entrenched in Renzhuang. Squad Leader Li was assigned the task of blowing open a solid brick wall to open a road for the attacking troops. The explosives were set, but they didn't detonate. The fuse, which was fifty or sixty meters long, was broken, leaving only a very small end. At this time, the Chiang army's bullets became even tighter and denser, but Squad Leader Li rushed up regardless, using dry grass to burn the explosives. The distance was too close, and the explosion was too fast. Li Zhaotang didn't have time to get away and was crushed by the suddenly collapsed wall. But he was clear-headed. He saw his comrades pouring in through the breach, knew that he had completed his task, and struggled to slowly push away the bricks and soil on his body and got up. Regardless of whether he had been injured, he rushed in through the breach and captured a rifle. (Wu Xiang)

　　解放区劳动人民的伟大特色
    首次参加战斗即建奇功 
    吕登科获英雄荣誉
    工兵班长李照堂当选特等英雄
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十五日电】以吴忠团长为首的一百八十名英雄之一的吕登科，首次参加战斗就获得英雄荣誉。这是解放区觉悟的劳动人民的伟大特色。他打进张凤集（巨野西南三十里），与蒋家嫡系美械十一师隔墙对战，反复冲锋，当他向蒋军阵地甩出第一颗手榴弹，未炸而着急的时候，一排副朱吟世赶来问他：“打过没有？”登科说：“班长嫌我年纪太小，不叫打。”吟世就教他先拉火线后摔，他就一气向蒋军阵地投了三颗，都爆炸了，把冲锋的蒋军打了回去。蒋军藏在阵地后叫喊：“缴枪吧，小八路。”登科气极了，骂着叫着说：“八路军里没有缴枪的！”等到手榴弹打完要使步枪时，登科放罢枪却忘了退子弹壳，拉不下拴，急的哭了。登科到营指挥部去找营长，营长给他半个馍、朱排副把烈士刘勤带的枪给他。小登科还没有把馍塞进嘴里就又提着枪钻进自己的工事里。刚蹲下来，机枪就把他帽子打掉了。接着，三颗炸弹落在他身边，其中一颗把他掀起来埋在土里。小登科却很清醒地想到敌人打炮过后，一定要冲锋，他赶快从土里爬出来，用枪瞄准进攻的蒋军，把正向前运动的蒋军打退了，把帽子找回来戴上。接着，美制蒋机飞临头上，小登科不慌不忙地蹲在阵地里，眯着眼睛打飞机，老战士关照他说：“不要暴露目标，你再打，我就揍你！”吕登科嘻着嘴说：“同志，你揍敌人，你揍我干吗？”
    在这次战斗结束之后，许多文化工作者都去访问他，想从那里找到“为什么一个参军不久的新战士就成为英雄”的秘密，他很爽朗地回答说：“我十八岁，个子低，参军嫌小，不要！我小是因家穷饿坏了，过去借一还二，还要给人家磕头！放帐的人才希望老蒋这大坏蛋来，他来了我就要饿死。我听说老蒋进攻解放区，就坚决要来干大队（正规军），来打这个大坏蛋。母亲知道了，也嫌我小，参加大队不放心，叫哥哥半路拦我回去，我说，弟兄娘儿们都想饿死还是想活？想活就让我去打老蒋！哥哥没办法，哭着回去了，我就参加了八路军。”
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十四日电】在我攻坚作战中，工兵爆炸所起的作用甚多，最近×部选举之特等战斗英雄中，有一好勇敢的工兵班长李照堂。鄄南战役时，蒋军一一九旅八十六团盘据在任庄，李班长受领任务去炸开一道坚固的砖墙，为进攻部队开辟道路。炸药按好了，但是没有拉响，长达五六十米的拉火线断了，只剩下很小的一个头，这时蒋军的枪弹更紧更密了，李班长却不顾一切冲上去，用干草去燃烧炸药，距离太近了，爆炸太快了，李照堂没有走得及，就被猛然塌倒的墙压住了。但他心里是清醒的，他看见同志们从缺口中涌进去，知道自己完成任务了，于是挣扎着慢慢的推开身上的砖土，爬了起来。他不管自己是否已经负伤，也就从缺口中冲进去，缴了一枝步枪。（吴象）
