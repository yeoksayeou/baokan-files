(This dispatch from our Taiyue Bureau on the 23rd)

Following the Shimin County Farmers' Association's call to "Further, More Boldly and Unreservedly Carry Out Investigation and Rent Reduction," the entire county has once again launched a struggle against feudal forces. The feudal demon, Wang Yuyuan, had already undergone three rent reductions and debt settlements by the masses, but the struggle was not thorough. This time, the peasants in the surrounding villages are once again carrying out a large-scale joint struggle, relitigating grievances and settling accounts.

	The masses in Zhangzhuang, Second District, have been mobilized for five years, but the feudal forces have still not been eliminated. Therefore, the peasants are not interested in any work. This inspection revealed that the 18 landlord households in the village originally owned 760 mu of land. After five years of rent and interest reduction, they still own 694 mu. The seven extremely poor households with no land to cultivate are still only planting a few mu of barren hillside land, unable to produce enough to eat. There are still 64 poor peasant households who cannot eat their fill. The most notorious tyrant in the village, Hou Shoulu, still lives in a tall building, keeps two concubines, eats thin porridge during the day and white flour at night, wears rags outside and leather clothes inside. The other 17 households only "scratched the surface," calculating three mu of land, three dou of rice, or five sheng of corn and three sheep, failing to shake his feudal roots at all.

The reasons for this phenomenon are: 1. Obstruction due to sentimentality. They are all neighbors, so they are embarrassed to act. Therefore, the peasants only get trivial benefits. The extremely poor Ma Xiaotu said in this re-litigation of grievances: "I have rented land for three generations, and all I have is a tattered cotton coat. I carry water and haul coal for others, and I even have to sew the landlord's wife's trousers. Why haven't I been able to turn over? Because the law can't reach me!" 2. Pity for the landlords, fearing that they will not be able to live, so they try to leave them more good land and nearby land, believing that the poor cannot "rise to heaven in one step" and can only turn over slowly. Therefore, Guo Renshun, an extremely poor peasant who has not been able to turn over after several account settlements, simply quit the Farmers' Association and went to Doujiaoling to sell food. 3. The majority of the masses were not mobilized. Only a few activists and cadres came forward, lacking strength. It was believed that those who did not speak up were not promising and could not be mobilized. After receiving instructions from the County Farmers' Association this time, the cadres and masses in each village held three days of deliberations, which the masses called "training" to finally eliminate feudal forces.

	Langbi Village in the Fifth District has also undergone four years of rent reduction and debt settlement, but because the village government is still controlled by feudal forces, the landlords have not been harmed. At each rent reduction meeting, everyone is harmonious and polite, as if inviting guests to dinner, yielding to each other. One of the big landlords, Tian Liqin, is still as wealthy as before. Now, when settling accounts with Tian Liqin, more than 1,000 shi of grain were calculated, but the evaluation committee was full of feudal lackeys. As a result, Tian Liqin only took out more than 70 pieces of miscellaneous items to cover the amount, and the five tenants who were allocated three dilapidated houses even had to pay money to buy them. Now, the peasants of Langbi are launching an earth-shaking struggle for a real turnaround, to completely destroy the feudal forces.

　　历次查减均不彻底
    士敏展开最后总清算
    【本报太岳二十三日电】士敏县农会发出“更进一步大胆放手进行查减”的号召后，全县重新向封建势力掀起斗争。封建魔王王玉元曾经群众三次减租清债，但斗争不彻底，此次周围村庄农民再次实行大联合斗争，重新诉苦清算。二区漳庄发动群众已五年，但封建势力依然没有消灭，因此农民对什么工作都没兴趣，此次检查发现全村十八户地主，原有土地七百六十亩，经五年减租减息，现仍有土地六百九十四亩，无地耕种的赤贫七户，至今只种着数亩荒坡地，无法生产，不能饱食的贫农，仍有六十四户，而全村首户的恶霸侯受禄，仍居住高楼大厦，养着两个小老婆，白天喝稀饭，黑夜吃白面，外面穿破衣，里面穿皮衣，其余的十七户，如“隔靴搔痒”似的算出了三亩地三斗米或五升玉茭、三只羊，根本未摇动他的封建老根。产生此种现象的原因：一、情面阻碍，都是邻居璧舍，不好意思，所以农民得到的只是鸡毛蒜皮，赤贫马小土，在此次重新诉苦中说：“租种三辈子地，落了个破棉衣，担水挑煤给人家干，还得给地主老婆扎裤腿没有翻身为什么？因为法令探不着！”二、怜惜地主，怕其无法生活，尽量多留好地与近地，认为穷人不能“一步登天”，只能慢慢翻身，因此曾经算过数次账，仍未翻身的赤贫郭仁顺，干脆退出农会，跑到豆角岭上去卖饭。三、没有动员起大多数群众，只几个积极分子和干部出头露面，没有力量，并认为不吭气的人没出息，无法发动。此次接到县农会指示后，各村干部群众进行了三天酝酿，群众叫作“练兵”以最后消灭封建势力。五区朗壁村，亦经四年的减租清债，但因村政权仍被封建势力把持，所以未曾伤害地主，每次减租会议上，大家和和气气好似请客吃饭，互相恭让，大地主之一田礼钦，依然豪富如昔，如今清算田礼钦时，算出粮食一千余石，但评议委员会中，全是封建狗腿，结果田礼钦仅拿出七十余件杂物便顶够数了，而五个佃户分得三间破房子还得出钱买。现在朗璧农民正展开一翻天覆地真正翻身的斗争，以彻底摧毁封建势力。
