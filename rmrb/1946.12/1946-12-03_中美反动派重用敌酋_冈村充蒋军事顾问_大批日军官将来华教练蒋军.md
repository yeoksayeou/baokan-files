Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th—The reactionary elements in China and the United States, in order to oppose the Chinese people, do not hesitate to re-employ Japanese fascist warlords. Former Japanese invading chieftain, General Yasuji Okamura, is still in Nanjing. Not only has he not been tried as a war criminal, but Chiang Kai-shek respects him as an honored guest, enjoying an extremely luxurious life, as Chiang Kai-shek's military advisor against the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This matter was previously secret, but recently Chiang Kai-shek actually gave Okamura the title of "liaison officer." Chiang Kai-shek does not hesitate to commit this treacherous and humiliating act, because the Japanese fascist warlord Okamura has rich experience in opposing the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The American imperialists not only do not oppose this humiliating act of Chiang Kai-shek, but also support it. It is reported that MacArthur, Marshall, and Chiang Kai-shek have agreed to hire a large number of Japanese officers as military instructors for Chiang's army. These Japanese officers will come to China soon.

　　中美反动派重用敌酋
  　冈村充蒋军事顾问
  　大批日军官将来华教练蒋军
    【新华社延安二十八日电】中国与美国的反动派，为了反对中国人民，竟不惜把日本法西斯军阀重新起用。前日本侵华寇酋冈村宁次大将，现在仍在南京，不但没有被当作战犯审判，而且被蒋介石尊如上宾，享受着极其优裕的生活，作为蒋介石反对中国人民解放军的军事顾问。这件事以前还是秘密的，最近蒋介石居然给了冈村以一个名义叫做“联络官”。蒋介石不惜做这种媚敌辱国的行为，其原因是因为日本法西斯军阀冈村有反对中国人民解放军的丰富经验。蒋介石的此种辱国行为，美国帝国主义者不但不反对，而且予以赞助。据悉麦克阿瑟、马歇尔与蒋介石已经商定聘请大批日本军官做蒋军的军事教练，这批日本军官不日即将来华。
