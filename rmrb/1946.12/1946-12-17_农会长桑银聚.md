Peasant Association Chairman Sang Yinju

Sang Yinju, the chairman of the peasant association of Weiliuhe Village, Erqu District, Neihuang, is 51 years old this year. After the land reform, he now owns 10.7 mu of land, and his active and responsible work is praised by the masses. His parents died early, and he grew up under his sister-in-law's care. At the age of seventeen, he worked as a hired laborer for Wu Tingliu in his village. At nineteen, he became a soldier for Yuan Shikai, but due to severe eye problems, he lost sight in one eye. He returned home in 1926 at the age of thirty-one, and everyone called him "Blind Man Sang." Unable to find work at home, he idled around all day, constantly stealing things from others to sell for opium. Everyone looked down on him, saying that "Blind Man Sang" was finished for life, which angered his wife, who remarried. Last winter, comrades from the district came to his village. By this time, he already knew that the Eighth Route Army could teach people to be good, allowing poor people to have food and turn their lives around. He was determined to learn to be good, so he took the initiative to talk to the comrades, seeking a way out. However, the masses refused to let him join the peasant association because of his opium addiction. He couldn't sleep at night, always trying to find a way to join the peasant association. He made up his mind to quit smoking and confessed and repented at the general meeting, saying: "I have done a lot of bad things in the past because I was forced by poverty. Now I have quit smoking and want to make progress and learn to be a good person. I am willing to join the peasant association." After joining the peasant association, he worked very actively, actively participating in the struggle against the local landlords and despots Wei Zilong, Wei Hualong, and Wei Delong. Later, after the corrupt chairman Ma Xiufeng was removed, he was elected. Immediately afterwards, he cooperated with other villages and jointly fought against the despotic landlords of Liuzhuang and Siyangzhuang. During the joint defense struggle, he also worked very actively, serving everyone wholeheartedly. Therefore, he was also elected as the joint defense instructor. Recently, he led the villagers in a successful turnaround, with each person receiving three mu of standard land, organizing 70 percent of the masses, and mobilizing 13 young adults to join the army. A few days ago, after the wartime service tasks were assigned, he led eight stretchers from the entire joint defense team, gloriously completing the task of carrying the wounded three times. He personally carried the wounded each time and led everyone to help the masses with production. When staying at Xujiazhuang in the southeast of Puyang, he personally led eight stretcher bearers to dig radishes, build radish cellars, fetch water, and cut reeds for the landlord. Just returning from the front lines carrying stretchers, he led the entire joint defense militia to the west of the river to strike the enemy. The masses happily talked about him, saying: "The current Sang Yinju is like a different person from the past. Now he can endure hardships and always works for everyone, becoming our good peasant association chairman!" (JiluYu South Branch)
