　　Helping the Masses Overturn Their Lives
    Ping Shun Cadres Voluntarily Donate Land
    [Our Dispatch] During the rent reduction movement in Ping Shun, cadres consciously donated land to help the masses overturn their lives. On the 24th of last month, Political Commissar Zhang Ping reported on the land policy at an enlarged meeting of county and district cadres. After three days of deliberation and discussion, cadres from landlord backgrounds took the lead in voluntarily donating land. Comrade Shen Gang, the Civil Affairs Section Chief of the county government, said, "My family has a landlord background. I am willing to donate six mu of good land, ten good houses, one cow, and some farm tools." Comrade Yue Yunbi, Director of the Armed Forces Committee, voluntarily donated fifteen mu of good land, a good house with a courtyard, and one mule. He said, "These things were all obtained by my father exploiting the poor as a landlord, and they should be returned to the poor." Comrade Yang Fusheng of the Public Security Bureau also donated two mu of land. (Wang Julin)

　　帮助群众翻身
    平顺干部自动献田
    【本报讯】平顺干部在查减运动中自觉献田，帮助群众翻身。上月二十四日，政委张平同志在县、区扩大干部会上报告了土地政策，又经过三天的酝酿讨论，地主出身的干部即以身作则，自觉的首起献田。县府民政科长申刚同志说：“我家庭是地主成份，愿献出六亩好地、十间好房、一头牛和一部分农具。”武委会主任岳蕴壁同志自动献出十五亩好地、一院好房和一头骡子，他说：“这些东西都是我父亲当地主剥削穷人的，应该归还穷人。”公安局杨富生同志亦献地二亩。　　　（王巨林）
