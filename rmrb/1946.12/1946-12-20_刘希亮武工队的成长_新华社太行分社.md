　　The Growth of Liu Xiliang's Armed Work Team
    Xinhua News Agency Taihang Branch
        I. Starting from Scratch
    Liu Xiliang is from Shangzhuang Village, Bo'ai Sixth District. He is twenty-seven years old this year. Before Bo'ai was liberated, local landlords and bullies forced Xiliang to sell his only two mu of land at a low price, and he drifted to Shanxi to beg for a living. After the liberation of Bo'ai, Xiliang returned to his hometown to participate in the great turnaround movement, leading the masses to overthrow the big bully Guo Baotai and eliminate special agent black gunners such as Sang Shixue and He Langui. He won the support of the villagers, who elected him as the director of the village armed committee. In August of this year, he became a district cadre. From his own personal experience, Xiliang realized that the poor must master armed forces in order to turn themselves around. Therefore, he actively led the masses to seize several rifles from the local tyrants and landlords and armed themselves. After the Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops occupied Bo'ai, Liu Xiliang led the militia of his village and the surrounding villages to transfer out, and soon organized an armed work team, going deep behind enemy lines and frequently operating near the highway and the Chiang Kai-shek puppet strongholds. On the 4th of last month, they cooperated with the troops to burn down six newly built pillboxes of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Xuliang, crushing the conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops to occupy Xuliang. On the same day, they operated independently in Xuliang, defeated the Chiang Kai-shek's army who were looting, and recovered all the bamboo goods looted from the villagers; on the 15th, they cooperated with a part of our main force to rush into the west and north gates of Bo'ai City twice in a row, killing four enemy sentries. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet returned-home corps only dared to shrink in the city and did not dare to live outside the city; on the 20th, Liu Xiliang led 20 team members to bravely block more than 100 Chiang Kai-shek troops who came to Jiu Jiafen to grab food. Relying on favorable terrain, they fired fiercely at the enemy, forcing the passive Chiang Kai-shek troops to shrink from the enclosure wall to the roof, and from the roof to the courtyard, and finally they fled. Not a single grain was snatched away, and a vehicle was abandoned.
            II. Development and Growth in Struggle
    Liu Xiliang's armed work team initially had only a few people, but now it has several dozen people, an increase of almost seven times. Liu Xiliang's armed work team, like other mass armed forces, has developed and grown in continuous struggle. As he himself said: "Although they are all peasants who have turned themselves around, there are still places where their thinking is not clear." Therefore, constantly fighting against the incorrect thoughts of the team members and making them stand on the correct side has become one of the decisive factors for the development and growth of this armed work team. Because everyone was initially unprepared, could not endure hardship, was unwilling to carry grain, and was unwilling to grind flour, Liu Xiliang discussed with everyone to find a solution, proposing: "Let's go down the mountain and carry the grain up the mountain. This will not only improve our lives, but also prevent the enemy from robbing it. If the Chiang Kai-shek army has no grain, they will not be able to occupy Qinghua (Bo'ai) for a long time, and we will be able to return home sooner." After clarifying everyone's thinking in this way, he and the district cadres took the lead in carrying grain, influencing the few inactive team members to become active, and their enthusiasm for fighting the enemy became even greater. A few days later, several ideas emerged among the team members, such as saying, "If the enemy occupies the city, won't we be finished?" Liu Xiliang and the district cadres conducted collective and individual current affairs and political education for the team members, using the recent actual examples of the armed work team to illustrate that "the Chiang Kai-shek army only occupies an empty city, and the vast countryside is still ours." He more clearly stated: "Our armed work team is the team to protect our hometown. When we eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, the bully, we are still ordinary people." This made everyone's morale even higher. Due to the Chiang Kai-shek puppet's deceptive propaganda, and using various relationships to coax the team members, saying: "You will not be killed if you return home. If you do not return, your family members will be treated badly." Therefore, some team members who did not have a clear understanding became uneasy again. Liu Xiliang proposed to let everyone "find the root of the disaster, find a way out, find a backer, and find a benefactor." After mass deliberation, a "heart-to-heart talk meeting" was held. Team member Wang Qingguang said: "If we don't turn ourselves around, Chiang Kai-shek will come to fight us anyway, because we are poor and fundamentally not of one mind with him. What is the root of the disaster? Old Chiang and the United States are the big root of the disaster, special agents, traitors, and bullies are the second root of the disaster, and not fighting and being a weakling and waiting to enjoy happiness is the third root of the disaster. Fighting to the end is the way out." Team member Chen Fuping said: "Before the Eighth Route Army came, I didn't have a single penny. Now I have three mu of land and a bamboo garden. This is all given to me by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are my old backer and my benefactor!" When everyone found their backer and benefactor, they unanimously said: "We must unite closely and fight Chiang Kai-shek, both big and small, to the end!" They also discussed issues such as production for self-salvation, and everyone's fighting spirit was even higher.
        III. Two Specific Experiences
    (1) Liu Xiliang said: "Every time he leads the team down the mountain for activities and returns, he must go through rectification and strengthen the team members' current affairs and political education. He often says: Every time we return from an activity, everyone's thinking will change more or less, and we must educate them according to their different thoughts so that each team member can have a clear understanding of the current situation or a problem. Several practical experiences have proven that simply solving the problem of life without solving the problem of thought is by no means a way to consolidate and strengthen the troops. (2) It is necessary to grasp the backbone and active members of the armed work team. With them taking the lead, better results can be achieved. At the same time, leaders must also be one with the team members in order to understand everyone's thoughts in a timely manner and give them education in a timely manner."

　　刘希亮武工队的成长
    新华社太行分社
        一、白手起家
    刘希亮是博爱六区上庄村人，今年二十七岁，博爱未解放前，村里地主恶霸逼迫希亮把仅有的二亩地贱价出卖，流落到山西求乞渡日。博爱解放后，希亮回到故乡参加大翻身运动，领导群众斗倒大恶霸郭保太，铲除了特务黑枪手桑士学、何兰贵等，博得了全村群众的拥护，群众选他为村武委会主任。今年八月更当了区干部。希亮从自己切身体验中，认识到穷人要翻身，一定得掌握武装，因此他便积极领导群众夺取了恶霸地主×枝步枪，武装了自己。蒋伪侵占博爱后，刘希亮即带领他村和周围各村的民兵转移出来，不久便组织了一个武工队，深入敌后，经常的活跃于公路和蒋伪据点附近。上月四日，他们配合部队烧毁了许良蒋军新修的六个炮楼，粉碎了蒋伪盘据许良的阴谋。同日在许良单独活动，击溃抢劫之蒋军，夺回该村群众被抢之全部竹货；十五日配合我主力一部接连两次扑入博爱城西、北二关，打死敌哨兵四名，蒋伪还乡团只敢缩居城内，不敢在城外住；二十日刘希亮又带领队员二十个，奋勇阻击到九家坟抢粮之百余蒋军，依据有利地形，向敌猛烈射击，使被动之蒋军，由围墙口缩到房顶，由房顶缩到院内，终于逃窜了。一粒粮也没有抢去，还遗弃车辆一部。
            二、斗争中发展壮大
    刘希亮武工队最初只有×人，现在已有××人，差不多发展了七倍。刘希亮武工队也和其他群众武装一样，是在不断的斗争中发展壮大起来的，正如他自己说：“虽说都是翻了身的农民，思想上还有认识不清的地方。”因此不断的和队员中不正确的思想作斗争，使其站到正确方面来，便成为这支武工队发展壮大的决定因素之一。因为大家最初准备不够，吃不了苦，不愿背粮，又不愿磨面，刘希亮即和大家一块讨论，想办法，提出：“咱们下山把粮食背上山来，既可改善生活，敌人又抢不走，蒋军没有粮食，不能在清化（博爱）久占，咱们便能早一天回家。”这样打通了大家思想后，他和区干部又带头背粮，影响少数不积极的队员，也积极起来，和敌人斗争的劲头就更大了。过了几天，队员中又产生了几种思想：如说“敌人占了城咱不就完了吗？”刘希亮便和区干部对队员进行集体与个别的时事政治教育，拿最近几天该武工队的实际例子，说明“蒋军只占一个空城，广大的乡村还都是咱们的。”他更明确的提出：“咱们武工队就是保护咱老家的队伍，把蒋介石恶霸消灭了，我们还是老百姓。”这使得大家情绪更高涨了。由于蒋伪的欺骗宣传，并利用种种关系哄骗队员说：“回家不杀，如不回来对家里人不客气。”因此，一部认识不清的队员又不安起来，刘希亮提出，叫大家“找祸根，找出路，找靠山，找恩人”，经过群众酝酿，召开了个“谈心事会”，队员王清光说：“咱不翻身，蒋介石也要来打咱，因为咱是穷人，根本不和他是一条心。啥是祸根呢？老蒋和美国是大祸根，特务、汉奸、恶霸是二祸根，不斗争当软蛋，等待享福是三祸根，干到底才是出路。”队员陈福平说：“八路军没来我分文钱没有，现在有三亩地，还有竹竿园，这都是毛主席共产党给我的。共产党八路军就是我的老靠山，就是我的恩人！”当大家找见靠山和恩人时，一致的说：“我们要团结得紧紧的和大小蒋介石干到底！”并讨论生产自救等问题，大家斗争情绪更高了。
        三、两点具体经验
    （一）刘希亮说：“他每次带队伍下山活动回来，必须经过整顿，加强队员的时事政治教育。他常说：每次活动回来，大家思想上或多或少要发生一些变化，一定要根据不同的思想，加以教育，使每个队员对目前形势或一个问题能有清楚的认识。几次实际证明，单纯的解决生活问题不解决思想问题，绝不是巩固壮大部队的办法。（二）要掌握武工队的骨干与积极分子，有了他们来带头，才能作出更好的成绩，同时领导人也要和队员们打成一片，才能及时了解大家的思想，及时给以教育。”
