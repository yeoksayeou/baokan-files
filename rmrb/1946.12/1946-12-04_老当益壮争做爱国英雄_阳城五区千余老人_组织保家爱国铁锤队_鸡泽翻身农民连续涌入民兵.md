　　Old and Strong, Striving to Be Patriotic Heroes
    Over a Thousand Elderly in the Fifth District of Yangcheng
    Organize the Home-Defense Patriotic Iron Hammer Team
  　Liberated Peasants in Jize Continuously Enlist in the Militia
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue 2nd Dispatch] Comrade Wang Yuan, deputy district chief of the fifth district of Yangcheng, at the mobilization meeting on November 15th to defend Yan'an and defend Chairman Mao, called on young people to go out and join the army to defend Yan'an; the elderly at home should organize a home-defense patriotic iron hammer team to cooperate with the army in guerrilla warfare when the enemy comes: when there is no fighting they should help the families of soldiers to produce, striving to become heroes. All the elderly at the scene considered it an honor to strive for the title of "Patriotic Hero" and actively responded to this call. The liberated hero Shi Xingtai volunteered to organize an iron hammer company; the grain transportation hero Duan Zhongyuan was willing to organize two iron hammer platoons. They clearly recognize that defending Yan'an and defending Chairman Mao is to defend their own fruits of liberation. Even landlords who had been liquidated, such as Shi Congde and Shi Youshi, also requested to join the iron hammer team, saying: "Chiang Kai-shek is selling out the country, and the people are against it, count me in." Xiao Mao, an old Hui Muslim aged fifty-three, Shi Bingsheng, an old doctor, and Pei Lan, an old cook at the district office, also actively participated in the iron hammer team. Xiao Mao, the old Hui Muslim, said: "Only with a democratic government can the Hui people have a status, and the Hui people must coexist with the democratic government." On the spot, a total of one thousand and eight elderly people from thirty-five villages participated in the home-defense patriotic iron hammer team, and were immediately organized into eighty-eight squads. At the end of the meeting, one thousand and eight iron hammers were raised high in the air, chanting in unison: "Chiang Kai-shek is a big stone slab, we will smash it with iron hammers!"
    [Our Newspaper Weixian 2nd Dispatch] The liberated peasants of Jize have extremely high patriotic enthusiasm for protecting their land. When the bandit Chiang entered the border area, the militiamen went to the front line in groups. A total of more than 300 people from the county participated in the people's army. As the number of militiamen in the rear decreased, a large number of young peasants joined the militia one after another during the mass movement to protect their fruits of liberation. In Baizhi Temple in the third district, the number of militiamen increased from 30 to 70. Each small village has at least one squad, and the weapons and equipment include pistols, grenades, rifles, machine guns, and grenade launchers, all of which are kept clean. Each district has established a backbone company and an ordinary company. The rapid development of the militia in both quantity and quality is due to the fact that the peasants' association changed the previous method of individual recruitment by the militia organization alone. When the masses were mobilized, it was proposed that "without armed forces, the despotic landlords cannot be suppressed," and after the fruits were distributed, it was proposed that "the armed forces should be strengthened to protect the fruits." In this way, combined with the needs of the masses, the militia developed greatly.
    [Another Dispatch] In order to carry out the winter military training movement, the Military Committee of Jize County, from the 14th to the 20th of last month, concentrated two hundred and ten militia captains and instructors from one hundred and thirty villages for a seven-day training. After thinking meetings and group discussions, everyone eliminated peaceful illusions and realized that if Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is not repelled, liberation cannot be guaranteed. In military studies, everyone was even more active. Classrooms and dormitories became training grounds, and those who had just received guns were reluctant to put them down, saying: "If we can't learn it, how can we teach others when we go back?" At the end of the training, all the trained cadres held an oath-taking ceremony, and everyone shouted in unison: "Resolutely fight Chiang Kai-shek, and never surrender." The militiamen who remained in the villages carried out military training preparations, preparing training grounds and hand grenades for training. The training time for the whole county is one and a half months. Political classes will be held at winter schools, and three hours are set for each day.

　　老当益壮争做爱国英雄
    阳城五区千余老人
    组织保家爱国铁锤队
  　鸡泽翻身农民连续涌入民兵
    【本报太岳二日电】阳城五区副区长王源老同志，在十一月十五日的保卫延安、保卫毛主席动员大会上，号召青年人出外参军，保卫延安；老年人在家组织保家爱国铁锤队，敌人来了，配合军队打游击：没事帮助抗属生产，争取英雄。全场老人听了，都以争取“爱国英雄”的称号为荣，积极响应这个号召。翻身英雄史兴太自报奋勇，组织一个铁锤连；运粮英雄段中元愿意组织两个铁锤排。他们明确认识保卫延安，保卫毛主席就是保卫自己翻身果实。连被清算过的地主史从得、史有士等也要求参加铁锤队，他们说：“蒋介石卖国，人民都反对，有我的一份”。五十三岁的老回民小毛、老医生史炳生、区公所的老火夫培兰等，也争相踊跃参加铁锤队，老回民小毛说：“有民主政府才有回民的地位，回民要和民主政府共存亡”。当场共有三十五个村一千零八个老人，参加了保家爱国铁锤队，当即编为八十八个班。散会时一千零八个铁锤高举空中齐呼：“蒋介石是块大石板，咱们要用铁锤打碎它”！
    【本报威县二日电】鸡泽翻身农民，爱国保土热情极高，当蒋贼进入边区的时候，民兵们即成群结队奔上前线，全县共三百余人参加了子弟兵。后方民兵数量减少，在群运中，大批青年农民，又纷纷参加民兵，保卫自己的翻身果实。三区柏枝寺即由卅人发展到七十人，每个小村至少有一个班，武器装备有短枪、手榴弹、步枪和机枪、掷弹筒等，都擦的净光。各区都建立起基干中队与普通中队。民兵能够质量并进的发展是由于通过农会，改变了单由民兵组织，个别吸收的方式，群众开始发动时，提出“没有武装镇压不住恶霸地主”，果实分配后，又提出“壮大武装保卫果实”，这样与群众需要结合，民兵即大发展。
    【又讯】鸡泽县武委会为开展冬季练武运动，在上月十四至二十日七天中，集训百三十村的民兵队长、指导员等二百一十人，大家在想想会与小组讨论后，扫除了和平幻想，认识到打不退蒋介石进攻，翻身还不算有保证。在军事学习上，大家更为积极，课堂、宿舍变成了练操场，新领枪的一会儿也舍不得放下，都说：“咱学不会，回去怎么教人家呀”。训练结束时，全体受训干部，举行宣誓，大家同声高呼：“坚决和老蒋干，决不投降”。留在村里的民兵，都进行练武酝酿，准备操场和训练用的手榴弹。全县练兵时间为一个半月，政治课到冬学去上，每天定为三个钟头。
