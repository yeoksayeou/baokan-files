　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Shanghai dispatch: A major tragedy of the Kuomintang authorities' massacre of peddlers has occurred here. Since August, the Kuomintang authorities in Shanghai have prohibited small peddlers from operating in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts, making it impossible for them to make a living. By late November, as many as six or seven hundred peddlers who continued to set up stalls were arrested, which aroused the public anger of the families of those arrested and other peddlers. On the morning of the 30th, thousands of people marched to the Shanghai Municipal Council to petition, followed by demonstrations. In the afternoon, the masses gathered in front of the Huangpu Police Station, protesting its unreasonable expulsion and arrest of peddlers and demanding the immediate release of those arrested. The Kuomintang authorities then ordered the police to spray the crowd with water cannons and ordered them to open fire, "instantly killing seven peddlers" and injuring many others. (Associated Press) Despite the Chiang side's bloody suppression, the masses continued to resist the Chiang government. Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen has ordered a city-wide curfew in Shanghai starting from the 1st.

    【新华社延安一日电】沪讯：此间发生国民党当局惨杀摊贩之大惨案，沪市国民党当局，自八月起禁止黄浦、老闸两区之小摊贩营业，使其无法为生。至十一月下旬，竟逮捕继续摆摊之小贩达六七百名，致激起被捕者家属及其他摊贩之公愤。三十日上午，数千群众结队至沪市参议会请愿，继即游行示威，至下午，群众齐集黄浦警察分局前，抗议其无理驱逐及逮捕摊贩，要求立刻释放被捕者。国民党当局即命令警察以水龙头向群众喷射，并下令开枪，当即有小贩“七名中弹毙命”，受伤者甚众。（美联社讯）群众不顾蒋方之血腥镇压，仍继续反抗蒋政府。沪市长吴国桢已下令自一日起上海全市实行戒严。
