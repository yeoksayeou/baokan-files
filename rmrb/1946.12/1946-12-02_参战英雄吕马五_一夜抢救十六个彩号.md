War Hero Lü Mawu
　　Rescued Sixteen Wounded Soldiers in One Night

[Reported by this newspaper] At the recent Hero Conference held in Shexian County, there was a first-class war hero named Lü Mawu, who had created the heroic feat of rescuing sixteen wounded soldiers in one night. Lü Mawu is a young militiaman from Baiquanshui Village in Shexian County. He only gained his freedom after the War of Resistance Against Japan. He often said to people, "Without the Communist Party, I would not have had my chance to turn over a new leaf." During the Pinghan Campaign last year, Mawu went to participate in the war and rescued wounded soldiers on the battlefield, braving bullets and showing great bravery. For example, when the troops attacked Yucao Village, Mawu said to the comrades in the army, "Wherever you fight, we will follow." When the troops began to attack, Mawu closely followed the troops forward. That night, it was pitch dark, and it was impossible to distinguish between the enemy and our wounded soldiers. He came up with the method of touching the collar badges and armbands. If there was a collar badge, it was a KMT soldier; if there was an armband but no collar badge, it was a Eighth Route Army soldier, and he would quickly rescue them. When he touched the first wounded soldier, he slowly pulled him out from a hole in the wall. After pulling out two in a row, he carried one on his back and supported the other, vigilantly sending them to the stretcher bearers of the rear company, rescuing the wounded soldiers. During the attack on Yucao Village, our army suffered a total of thirty-five casualties, and Mawu rescued sixteen of them. After the Pinghan Campaign, at the summary conference for war participation, he was selected as a first-class war hero of the county.

　　参战英雄吕马五
    一夜抢救十六个彩号
    【本报讯】涉县最近召开的群英大会上，有一个一等参战英雄吕马五，他曾创出一夜抢救十六个彩号的英勇事迹。吕马五是涉县白泉水村一个青年民兵，抗战以来才翻了身，他常好对人说：“没有共产党，就没有我的翻身时光。”去年平汉战役时，马五去参战，在战场上冒着枪林弹雨抢救彩号，表现十分英勇。如部队攻打玉草村时，马五向部队同志们说：“你们杀到那里，我们跟到那里。”当部队开始攻击时，马五紧紧跟随着部队前进。那天夜里天黑漆漆的，敌人和我们的彩号辨别不出来，他便想出摸领章与臂章的办法，摸着有领章就是顽军，若有臂章没领章便是八路军，就赶快抢救。当他摸好第一个彩号时，他慢慢地从墙孔接出来，一连接出两个后，他背着一个，扶着一个，很机警的送给后连的担架，把彩号抢救出来。在攻打玉草村中，我军共挂彩三十五个，马五就抢救了十六个。平汉战役后，在总结参战大会上，被选为全县一等参战英雄。
