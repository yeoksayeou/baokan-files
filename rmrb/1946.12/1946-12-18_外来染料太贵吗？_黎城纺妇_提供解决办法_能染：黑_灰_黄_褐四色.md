Are Imported Dyes Too Expensive?
　　
Licheng Weavers Provide Solutions
    Can Dye: Black, Gray, Yellow, Brown Four Colors

[Our newspaper Licheng dispatch] To promote local products and overcome dye difficulties, women in Licheng collectively researched the following indigenous dyeing methods during their winter study class on November 24th: A. Two methods for dyeing black cloth: (1) Take the stamen hearts from the top of hemp seeds (hemp seed fibers), put them in a pot and boil for twenty minutes, then remove the stamens, add two liang of green vitriol to melt it, then put the white cloth that has been soaked in warm water into the pot and boil for one hour. After removing and drying, it becomes black cloth. Using this method, one bamboo basket of hemp stamens can dye seven chi of white cloth. (2) Put four liang of dried Dichondra repens into water and boil briefly, then remove it and add one liang of green vitriol to dye one chi of cloth black. B. Method for boiling persimmon yellow cloth: Mash the leaves of fruit trees from June and July into a thin paste, mix with the cloth, rub evenly, and then spread it out to dry with the front side facing down. When it is almost dry, slightly dampen the blemishes on the surface with water, and then dry it to create a beautiful persimmon yellow color. C. Method for boiling camel color: (1) Pound apricot tree roots into small pieces, boil them in a pot for one hour, remove them, put in the white cloth, boil and then dry to make camel color. (2) Put green walnut husks in a pot and boil for two hours, remove them, and then boil the white cloth in the resulting liquid to achieve the color. D. Method for dyeing gray: (1) Boil black bean water together with white cloth for a while to achieve the color. One sheng of black bean water can dye six chi of gray cloth. (2) Use boiling water to steep small hemp seed ash, and put the cloth into the ash water and rub it for a while to achieve the color. (3) Burn sesame seeds until they are half-charred, then crush them, steep them with boiling water, then put the wet white cloth in and rub it, and then take it out and dry it to achieve the color.

    外来染料太贵吗？　　
    黎城纺妇提供解决办法
    能染：黑·灰·黄·褐四色
    【本报黎城讯】黎城城内妇女，为提倡土货，克服染料困难，于十一月二十四日上冬学课时，集体研究出以下几种土染办法：甲、染黑布法两种：（一）将大麻籽顶上的花蕊心）麻籽索儿取下来，放进锅内煮二十分钟，然后捞出花蕊，加二两绿叶使熔化，再将用温水浸过的白布放进去煮，一点钟后，捞出晒干即成黑布。此法一竹篮大麻蕊可染七尺白布。（二）将四两锄儿草（干的）放进水里煮一下，捞出去，又放进一两绿叶，即可把一尺布染黑。乙、煮柿黄布办法：将六、七月间的果树叶捣成稀糊后，和布放在一起，搓揉匀后，正面向下晒开，到快干时，可用水把上面的疤块稍微湿一下，再晒干即成很好看的柿黄色。丙、煮驼色办法：（一）把杏树根捣成碎块，在锅内煮一小时捞出，将白布放进去，煮后取出晾干即成。（二）用绿核桃皮放进锅里煮两小时取出，将白布放进一煮就成。丁、染灰色办法：（一）煮黑豆水和白布一起煮一阵即成。一升黑豆水可煮灰布六尺。（二）用开水冲小麻籽灰，将布放进灰水内搓揉一会儿即成。（三）用芝麻烧成半焦后捣碎，开水冲过，然后把浸湿过的白布放进搓揉，取出晾干即成。（杨平意、范蔚鑫）
