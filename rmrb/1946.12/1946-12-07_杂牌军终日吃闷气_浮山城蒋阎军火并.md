　　Ragtag Troops Endure Constant Humiliation
    Chiang and Yan Armies Clash in Fushan City
    [Our Taiyue Dispatch, 3rd] The Chiang and Yan troops trapped inside and outside Fushan City have recently engaged in infighting due to the looting of grain and clothing. The Chiang army, relying on its superior strength and numbers, directed the Yan army's "Love the Homeland Corps" to defend outside the city. Because the Eighth Route Army and the masses have been besieging the enemy day and night, cutting off their supply lines, the Yan army is suffering from hunger and cold. On November 7th, the "Love the Homeland Corps" stole a few pieces of clothing in Hanjia Geda, and the Chiang army in the city forcibly demanded them. On the 14th, the "Love the Homeland Corps" stole sesame oil, cloth, and felt from Hama River, and the Chiang army in the city suddenly moved out to surround them and took all the goods away. Once, the "Love the Homeland Corps" stole four sheep, which were also taken away by the Chiang army. The contradictions between the Chiang army and the "Love the Homeland Corps" intensified, and finally on the 27th, they cursed each other and opened fire for an hour, resulting in many casualties on both sides.

　　杂牌军终日吃闷气
    浮山城蒋阎军火并
    【本报太岳三日电】困居浮山城内外的蒋阎军，近因抢夺粮食衣服，发生自相火并情事。蒋军依仗势大人众，指使阎军“爱乡团”在城外防守。由于八路军于群众日夜武装围困，将敌补给线切断，阎军饥寒交迫。上月七日“爱乡团”到韩家圪瘩抢到几件衣服，城内蒋军便武力索取。十四日“爱乡团”又到蛤蟆河抢得香油、布匹、毡布回来，城内蒋军突然出动包围，把东西全部夺走。一次“爱乡团”抢到四只羊，又被蒋军夺去。蒋军与“爱乡团”矛盾日益加深，终于二十七日互相辱骂开火达一小时，双方伤亡甚多。
