　　Grasp Armament Tightly and Thoroughly Eliminate Feudalism
    Taigu Launches Overturning and Inspection
    [Our newspaper Changzhi dispatch] Taigu County, located on the border, has victoriously carried out land reform amidst intense struggle against the enemy. Most villages have initially realized "land to the tiller," with each poor peasant having at least three mu of land. This county extensively and rapidly launched the movement to oppose traitors and settle accounts this spring. After the beginning of summer, the Yan-puppet regime concentrated its forces to seize wheat and occupied most villages in our plains area. Our all-out effort was focused on fighting the enemy to defend the wheat harvest. At the same time, due to a lack of experience in carrying out land reform during wartime, the mass movement once declined. In late July, after driving the enemy away, the occupied villages were liberated again, and the mass emancipation movement was revived. The county leadership then clearly pointed out: "Without the mobilization of the masses, the struggle against the enemy will have no pillar; without the victory of the struggle against the enemy, the mass movement will lose its guarantee. The two must be closely integrated." And called on all cadres to boldly let go and create experience in combining war and mass movement in actual practice, and loudly put forward the slogan "Thoroughly eliminate feudalism and realize land to the tiller." After clarifying their thinking, all the cadres and comrades of the emancipation teams went deep into the countryside, and the liquidation movement was launched again universally and fiercely. During the movement, the Yan-puppet troops constantly raided, but because our villages were prepared for war, they transferred when the enemy came and carried out emancipation when they seized the war gap. By the beginning of the autumn harvest, most villages had gone through a climax and were moving towards depth, initially realizing "land to the tiller." According to statistics from thirteen administrative villages and forty-nine natural villages: more than 220 traitors and bullies were overthrown, and the fruits of the peasants' blood and sweat recovered included: more than 10,000 mu of land, more than 3,200 rooms, more than 2,500 shi of grain, 114 head of livestock, and many assets and clothing. Among 2,871 households, 2,225 households received fruits, and 422 extremely poor households were completely eliminated, with each person having at least 3.3 mu of land on average. More than 7,100 people were involved in the movement, accounting for more than 65% of the population in the areas where the movement was carried out. The number of members of the peasant association has developed to 1,465, and there are already 541 militiamen, with organized masses accounting for more than 60% of the population. As the winter emancipation and inspection began, the leadership emphasized: "The elimination of feudalism is not yet thorough. The in-depth movement in half of the county's villages is only the beginning. A few backward villages have not yet been greatly mobilized, and the mass organizations are still very weak. According to county-wide statistics, the members of the peasant association only account for 13% of the population, and the ideological awareness of the masses is still very poor. This winter, we must thoroughly implement it and seek the complete realization of 'land to the tiller.'" The county's emancipation and inspection are now underway. (Joint Office)

　　抓紧武装彻底消灭封建
    太谷展开翻身大检查
    【本报长治讯】地处边沿的太谷县，在紧张的对敌斗争中，胜利的进行土地改革，大部村庄初步实现了耕者有其田，每个贫苦农民均已有三亩以上的土地。该县于今春在广大农村普遍迅速的开展了反奸清算。入夏后阎伪集中兵力抢麦，侵占我平川地区大部村庄，我全力因集中对敌斗争，保卫麦收，同时也因缺乏在战争中进行土地改革的经验，群运曾一度消沉。七月下旬，将敌赶走，被占村庄重获解放，群众翻身运动随即再起。县领导上遂即明确指出：“没有群众的发动，对敌斗争就没有支柱；没有对敌斗争的胜利，群众运动就失去保障，两者必须紧密结合起来。”并号召所有干部，都要大胆放手，在实际运动中创造战争与群运结合的经验，响亮提出“彻底消灭封建，实现耕者有其田”的口号。思想明确后，全县干部与翻身队同志即深入乡村，清算运动即又普遍猛烈的开展起来。运动中，阎伪军曾不断奔袭，但我各村因均有了战争准备，敌来即转移，抓住战争空隙即进行翻身。截至秋收开始时，大部村庄均经过高潮走向深入，初步实现了耕者有其田。据十三个行政村、四十九个自然村统计：共打垮奸霸二百二十余个，农民收回的血汗果实有：土地一万余亩、房三千二百余间、粮食二千五百余石、牲口一百一十四头及许多资财衣物等。二千八百七十一户中，即有二千二百二十五户分得果实，四百二十二户赤贫全部消灭，计每人平均有土地最少亦在三亩三分以上。卷入运动的群众达七千一百余人，占开展运动地区人口百分之六十五以上。农会会员发展至一千四百六十五人，民兵已有五百四十一人，有组织群众已占人口百分之六十以上。冬季翻身大检查开始，领导上强调提出：“封建消灭的还不很彻底，全县半数村庄深入运动仅是开始，少数落后村还未大动，群众组织还很薄弱，按全县统计，农会会员仅占人口百分之十三，群众思想觉悟还很差，今冬必须深入贯彻，求得全部的彻底实现耕者有其田”。现该县翻身大检查正在普遍进行中。（联合办公室）
