　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Belgrade dispatch: The Slavic Congress, which opened on the 8th, conducted heated discussions on continuing to carry out the anti-fascist struggle and developing cooperation between the Slavic nations to consolidate world peace and democracy. It announced its closing on the 13th after passing detailed resolutions on relevant issues. During the meeting, representatives from Southern, Czech, Bulgarian, Soviet, and Polish countries spoke successively. The speech by Southern representative Kilaki on the 12th received extremely warm applause. He refuted the fallacy of the so-called Eastern European "Iron Curtain," stating, "The struggle for democracy and peace is also taking place in the West. What reason do the Slavic peoples have to separate from these friends? The Slavs do not need any 'Iron Curtain'; this is precisely what Churchill and the new warmongers want to establish. They want to separate and isolate the West from the East, and to create opposition between the West and the East, thereby saving their imperialist positions in the West that have already been shaken."

　　斯拉夫大会圆满闭幕
    对加强合作继续反法西斯有详细决议
    南代表讲演驳斥东欧“铁幕”谬论
    【新华社延安十六日电】贝尔格莱德讯：斯拉夫大会于八日开幕后，即就继续展开反法西斯斗争及发展各斯拉夫民族间的合作，以巩固世界和平民主等问题进行热烈讨论。并于十三日通过有关问题的详细决议后，宣告闭幕。会议期间，南、捷、保、苏、波等国代表曾相继发言，南代表基拉基十二日的演讲获得了极热烈的鼓掌。他驳斥所谓东欧“铁幕”的谬论称：“争取民主和平的斗争，在西方亦同样在进行。对于这些朋友，斯拉夫民族有什么理由和他们分开呢？斯拉夫人不须要什么“铁幕”，这正是邱吉尔及新战争挑拨者想要建立的。他们想使西方脱离东方而孤立，使西方与东方对立，从而挽救他们在西方已经动摇了的帝国主义阵地。”
