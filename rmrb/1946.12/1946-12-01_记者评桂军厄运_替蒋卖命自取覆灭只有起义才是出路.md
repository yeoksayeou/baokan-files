　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on the Misfortune of the Guangxi Army
  　Serving Jiang's Interests Leads to Self-Destruction; Only Uprising is the Way Out
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, November 28th] Our agency's special correspondent, Si Ma Long, commented on the annihilation of the Gui系 (Guangxi Clique) Jiang's 7th Army in the offensive against Dingji Sugar Mill and other places northwest of Huaiyin, stating: "This is further proof that Chiang Kai-shek is using a borrowed knife to kill people and deliberately eliminate dissidents. When the 7th Army first came out of Guangxi, it had three divisions (171st, 172nd, and 138th) with thirteen regiments and thirty-nine battalions. However, Chiang Kai-shek drove them to the front lines of the anti-Communist civil war to be consumed daily. Before this offensive, they had been reduced to less than sixteen battalions, and Chiang Kai-shek has not provided them with a single soldier or bullet as replenishment (except for those forcibly recruited), leaving them to perish on their own. After the LianShui battle, under Chiang Kai-shek's repeated coercion, they grudgingly, with a belly full of resentment, steeled themselves and attacked the New Fourth Army's positions, resulting only in defeat. It is quite clear that steeling oneself is not the solution; only by emulating the righteous actions of Generals Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, Kong Congzhou, and others is there a way out. Under the erroneous policy of the Bai Chongxi clique, who only sought personal promotion and wealth, the Guangxi Army donned mourning for Chiang Kai-shek and marched onto the civil war battlefield. The result, in addition to losing troops and dwindling strength, is a thoroughly bad reputation. This should serve as a profound lesson for all non-Chiang Kai-shek direct line troops."

　　新华社记者评桂军厄运
  　替蒋卖命自取覆灭只有起义才是出路
    【新华社华中十一月廿八日电】本社特派记者司马龙评桂系蒋军第七军在进攻淮阴西北丁集糖坊等地遭歼灭性打击事称：“这是蒋介石借刀杀人蓄意排除异己之又一证明。第七军出广西之初，原有三个师（一七一、一七二、一三八）十三个团三十九个营，但被蒋介石驱至反共内战最前线逐日消耗，至此次进攻前，已不足十六个营，蒋介石迄未予以一兵一卒之补充（自行拉丁者除外），听其自灭。涟水战役后，在蒋介石一再迫促下，蹩的满肚子怨气，硬着头皮向新四军阵地进攻，结果只有溃败一途。十分明白，硬着头皮不是办法，只有效法高树勋、潘朔端、孔从周等将军之正义举动才是出路。桂军在白崇禧辈只图个人升官发财之错误政策下替蒋介石披麻带孝，走上内战战场，结果除损兵折将消磨渐尽外，还落的一身臭，实可为一切非蒋嫡系部队之殷鉴。
