　　Jilu Yu Hui Muslim Association
    Sends Letter to Muslim Brothers of Ma Hongkui's Department: Do Not Die for Chiang's Dictatorial Civil War
    [Reported from Jilu Yu on the 29th of this month] The Muslims here are extremely indignant upon hearing that Ma Hongkui of Ningxia is leading his troops to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The Jilu Yu Hui Muslim Association, representing 500,000 Muslims, sends a special letter to all the Muslim brothers of Ma Hongkui's department, urging them not to be cannon fodder for the Sino-American reactionaries. The letter states in brief: Most of the officers and soldiers of your department are outstanding sons of our Northwest Muslims. They have achieved remarkable results in guarding the frontier and defending the motherland. Now, Chiang Kai-shek has given you American weapons and ordered you to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. But you must know that the American weapons given to you were exchanged for the sale of national sovereignty. The area you are ordered to attack is a liberated area that has implemented peace and democracy for many years, where everyone is well-fed and clothed and lives in peace and contentment. You are ordered to kill your own compatriots. If you are used by them to carry out a civil war that betrays the country, you will be hated by the people and there will be dire consequences. The letter continues: The Muslims in Jilu Yu and other liberated areas, under the policy of the democratic government to support the development of minority nationalities, have organized their own armed forces and stand on the front line of the patriotic self-defense war to defend peace and democracy. This is the glory of our Muslims. It is hoped that you will rein in at the edge of the precipice, refuse to follow the chaotic orders, immediately stop attacking the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and learn from the patriotic and righteous actions of Generals Gao Shuxun, Hao Pengju, Hu Jingduo, Wei Fenglou, and others in the Northwest Army, withdraw from the civil war, and stage a glorious uprising. Even if you are forced to go to the front line, you can simply lay down your weapons in front of the people to show that you will not be used by Chiang the thief, which is also a glory.

　　冀鲁豫回民联合会
    函告马鸿逵部回民弟兄
    勿为蒋家独裁内战送死
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】此间回民闻悉宁夏回胞马鸿逵率部进攻陕甘宁边区，愤慨至极。冀鲁豫回民联合会代表五十万回民，特函告马鸿逵部全部回军弟兄，勿为中美反动派当炮灰。该函略称：贵部将士多系我西北回民优秀子弟，镇守边陲，保卫祖国，成绩卓著，而今蒋介石竟发给你们美式武器，令你们向陕甘宁边区进攻，但要知道发给你们的美式武器，是他出卖国家主权换来的，令你们进攻的地区，是已实行了和平民主多年，人人丰衣足食，安居乐业的解放区，令你们残杀的是自己的同胞；若你们被他们利用，进行卖国内战，是为人民所痛恨，将会有恶果。该函继称：冀鲁豫和各解放区的回民，在民主政府扶植少数民族发展的政策下，都纷纷的组织了自己的武装，为保卫和平民主，站在了爱国自卫战争的最前线，这是我回民的光荣。希望你们悬崖勒马，拒绝乱命，立刻停止进攻陕甘宁边区，学西北军高树勋、郝鹏举、胡景铎、魏风楼等将军的爱国义举，退出内战，光荣起义。即迫不得已到前线者，可在人民面前，干脆的放下武器，表示不为蒋贼利用，亦属光荣。
