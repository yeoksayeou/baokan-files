    Thorough Liquidation in the Seventh District of Wu'an
    Investigation and Rent Reduction Combined with Anti-Espionage Achieves Victory
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The combination of investigation and rent reduction with anti-espionage work has led to new progress in the mass movement in the Seventh District of Wu'an (an old revolutionary base area). After several years of rent reduction and investigation movements, most farmers in the district have achieved liberation. However, some landlords still retain feudal vestiges, and a small number of poor farmers have very little land (for example, in Dongbailin Village, with 370 households, 77 households lack land and housing, and more than 40 households have an average of only one mu of land per person); a considerable number of backward masses have not been well mobilized; middle peasants are afraid of “cutting the leeks” (exploitation). In the first half of the year, cadres hoped for peace and relaxed their work, and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents took the opportunity to operate secretly. With the large-scale outbreak of the civil war in July, the secret agents intensified their efforts to restore and develop their organizations, attempting to restore their rule. However, due to urgent tasks such as participating in the war, joining the army, and the autumn harvest, we had not yet launched a mass anti-espionage campaign, except for cracking individual espionage cases. In October, the district preliminarily studied the class relations and mass movement situation in various villages and began to launch the investigation of rent reduction. In the villages of Wangucheng, Longwu, and Bailin, nine villages successively discovered Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent organizations such as the "Common Progress Society," with local bullies and landlords as their backbone, and various sabotage activities. They exploited the fear of “cutting the leeks” to win over middle peasants, deceived poor peasants with the idea that “they cannot turn over a new leaf by relying on farmers' associations and the Eighth Route Army,” enticed vagrants with promises of promotion and wealth, intimidated ordinary backward masses with talk of "changing the sky," and used "revenge" to reunite dissatisfied elements who had been struggled against or criticized. They spread rumors to sabotage participation in the war and joining the army, disintegrate mutual aid groups, attack the prestige of cadres and labor heroes, sent female secret agents to poison and assassinate, made friends, formed sworn brotherhoods, and were very active in their activities. The village head of Wangucheng, the director of the general anti-movement in Bailin, the education committee member, and the volunteer teacher were all secret agent elements who had infiltrated. Based on this situation, the district decided to combine investigation and rent reduction with anti-espionage work, to thoroughly eliminate feudal forces politically and economically. At the beginning of last month, Wangucheng Village, a feudal fortress, was first broken through: The crimes of the secret agent landlord Kang Qingzhang, who paralyzed the leadership with a progressive facade, infiltrated the party, seized the position of village head, attacked good cadres, and suppressed the mass movement, were exposed and liquidated by the masses. The situation in the village completely changed, and the masses are now continuing to investigate the secret agent organization with great enthusiasm, while implementing land redistribution. The masses in Longwu Village launched a liquidation against the secret agent landlords Guo Yingxiu and Guo Dian, and at the same time exposed their conspiracy to launch a riot in October. The crime of the secret agent landlord Feng Yucai in Xinghua Village, who had lent water to militiamen to clean their guns in the past, causing the gun barrels to rust and explode in their hands, was also uncovered. In Shangbailin, a dozen secret agent landlords headed by the big local bully Guo Liantang were successively liquidated by the masses; their past and recent crimes were exposed more thoroughly than ever before; the masses' emotions were also higher than at any previous time: many backward masses and women who “didn't utter a sound” during the last movement this time universally poured out years of grievances and sufferings. According to the reports from various villages at the beginning of this month, Dong, Xibailin, Xiabailin, Yangyi, Dongshan, Chanfang, Liuqu, Xinghua, Maluo and other villages have all achieved considerable success in both liquidation and anti-espionage work. On the one hand, the masses reclaimed a lot of land and property (Shangbailin Village alone calculated over 7 million yuan) and implemented land redistribution; on the other hand, they tracked down and dealt with many espionage cases. They demanded that the government punish the major secret agents according to law, released the duped elements on bail separately, without touching their property, thus winning over many duped people to confess voluntarily. In order to prevent the "expansion" tendency in anti-espionage, the arrest of duped elements has generally been stopped (many have been supplied), and political education and anti-espionage education have been strengthened to eradicate espionage activities in the long term.

    武安七区追根清算
    查减反特同获胜利
    【本报特讯】查减结合反特，武安七区（老区）群运获新进展。该区经过数年减租与查减运动，大部农民均已翻身。但仍有若干地主残留着封建尾巴，一小部分贫苦农民土地很少（如三百七十户的东柏林村，即有七十七户缺地缺房，其中有四十多户，每人只平均一亩多地）；有相当数量的落后层群众尚未很好发动；中农存在着怕“割韭菜”思想。前半年干部奢望和平，工作放松，蒋特乘机暗中活动。七月大规模内战爆发，特务更加紧恢复与发展组织，企图复辟。而我因参战参军、秋收秋耕等任务迫切，除个别破获某些特务案件外，迄未发动群众反特。十月份区里初步研究各村阶级关系与群运情况，开始发动查减时，万谷城、龙务、柏林等九村均先后发现以恶霸地主为骨干的“共进会”等蒋特组织与各种破坏活动。他们利用怕“割韭菜”心理，拉拢中农，以“靠农会、靠八路军翻不了身”，欺骗贫农，以升官发财引诱流氓，以“变天”威吓一般落后群众，以“复仇”团聚被斗争或被批评过的不满分子，造谣破坏参战参军，瓦解互助组，打击干部与劳动英雄的威信，派女特务下毒暗杀，拜朋友，结弟兄，活动甚为积极。万谷城村长、柏林总抗动、教育委员、义务教员，均是打入之特务分子。区里根据此种情况，决定查减与反特结合进行，从政治上、经济上彻底扫清封建势力。上月初，封建堡垒万谷城村首先被突破：以进步面貌麻痹领导，打入党内，窍据村长职位，打击好干部，压制群众运动的特务地主康清章等的罪行被群众揭发与清算了，该村局面完全改观，群众现正以高度热情继续清查特务组织，同时实行填平补齐。龙务村群众向特务地主郭英秀、郭殿等展开清算，同时揭发彼等拟于十月暴动的阴谋计划。杏花村特务地主冯玉才过去以水借给民兵擦枪，致使枪筒生锈，打炸了手的罪行，亦被追出。上柏林以大恶霸郭连堂为首的十来个特务地主，先后被群众清算；其过去与最近的种种罪恶，被揭发得较以往任何一次为彻底；群众情绪亦较以往任何时期为高：上次运动时“不哼气”的许多落后群众与妇女，这次普遍把多年冤气与苦事倾吐出来。根据本月初各村汇报，东、西柏林、下柏林、阳邑、东山、禅房、六渠、杏花、马洛等村，都已在清算与反特两方面获得相当成绩。群众一方面索还了许多土地房产（上柏林一村即算出七百来万元），实行填平补齐；另方面，追出并处理许多特务案件。对大特务要求政府依法惩办，上当分子分别取保释放，并不动其财产，这样争取了许多上当者自动坦白。为防止反特中“扩大化”的偏向，一般已停止逮捕上当分子（被供出来的很多），而加强时事教育与反特防特教育，在长期工作中根绝特务活动。
