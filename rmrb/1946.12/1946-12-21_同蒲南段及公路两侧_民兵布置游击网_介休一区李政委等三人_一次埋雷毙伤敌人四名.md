　　The Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway and Roadsides
    Militia Deploys Guerrilla Networks
    Li, Political Commissar of the First District of Jiexiu, and Two Others
    Kill or Wound Four Enemies in a Single Mine-laying Operation
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 17th] Along the southern section of the Tongpu Railway and the roadsides, our militia guerrilla teams have deployed a guerrilla network spanning hundreds of miles, causing the Chiang, Yan, and puppet troops to sigh that "it's difficult to move an inch." On the 7th, more than 30 Chiang-puppet soldiers escorted two carts from Linfen to Fushan. As soon as they reached Xizuoling, they were ambushed by our militia Home Guard team, who captured two carts and captured three enemies alive. On the same day, Chiang's troops from Linfen raided Yangcun but were ambushed by Zhang Sanhu's militia team, killing 13 enemies, including a company commander, and seizing one rifle, one pistol, and more than 500 rounds of ammunition. On the 9th, more than 300 men from the 89th Regiment of the 30th Brigade of Chiang's army in Hongdong detoured northwest along the Fen River but were still ambushed by us, with five killed and one captured. On the 12th, Chiang's troops in Huoxian came out specifically for revenge, but as soon as they reached Wangcun, they fell into our militia's minefield, killing and wounding several.
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 17th] In the struggle to protect grain by the militia in the first and second districts of Jiexiu, 19 enemies were killed or captured within ten days (from the 23rd of last month to the 3rd of this month). On the 29th of last month, Li, the political commissar of the first district, led the sharpshooters Li Yingkui and Zhang Sanhu to set up an ambush in Xialiang Village. Because the enemy was late in starting, Political Commissar Li proposed a mine-laying competition. He himself laid a mine at the intersection, and Li Yingkui and Zhang Sanhu each laid a mine at the sentry positions where the enemy was expected to arrive. Until the 3rd of this month, more than 50 members of Zhang Lanzhi's Yan puppet-organized "Struggle Corps" went to Xialiang to seize grain. Three landmines exploded in succession, killing two enemies, wounding two, and destroying one machine gun and one rifle each. The masses in the village were very surprised and said, "When did you bury these mines? We didn't even know. Landmines are really 'powerful' (dangerous)! Quickly bury some in our grain jars so they can come and eat them!" For this, the Jiexiu County Headquarters specially awarded Political Commissar Li, Li Yingkui, Zhang Sanhu, and others with a fountain pen each and called on all county cadres and militia to learn from them.

　　同蒲南段及公路两侧
    民兵布置游击网
    介休一区李政委等三人
    一次埋雷毙伤敌人四名
    【本报太岳十七日电】同蒲路南段及公路两侧，我民兵游击队布置纵横百里的游击网，蒋阎伪军大有“寸步难行”之叹。七日，蒋伪三十余人，自临汾押大车二辆至浮山，刚到西佐岭即遭我民兵保家队伏击，缴获大车两辆，活捉敌三人。同日，临汾蒋军出扰阳村，又遭张三虎民兵队伏击，歼敌连长以下十三名，缴获步枪一支、手枪一支、子弹五百余发；九日，洪洞蒋军三十旅八九团三百余人，特绕道汾河西北上，然仍不免遭我伏击，被击毙五名，一人就擒。霍县蒋军十二日专意出来报复，刚走到王村，又陷入我民兵地雷网中，毙伤数名。
    【本报太岳十七日电】介休一、二区护粮保丁斗争，十天内（自上月二十三至本月三日）毙俘敌十九名。上月二十九日，一区李政委带领神枪手李应奎、张三虎至下梁村设伏，因敌迟迟未出发，李政委便提出埋雷竞赛，他自己在路口埋雷一颗，李应奎和张三虎在敌人每到时的哨兵位置上各埋雷一颗，直至本月三日，张兰之阎伪编村“奋斗团”五十余人至下梁枪粮，三颗地雷接连爆发，炸死敌二名，炸伤二名，炸毁机步枪各一支，该村群众非常惊奇的说：“你们什么时候埋下雷？我们都不知道，地雷就是“家伙”（利害），赶快在我们粮食瓮里埋上些，叫他们来吃吧！”介休县指挥部为此，特奖李政委、李应奎、张三虎等水笔各一支，并号召全县干部民兵向他们学习。
