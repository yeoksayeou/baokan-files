[Reported by this newspaper] The Jinnan First Prefectural Committee's Civil Affairs Department recently issued a circular stating: If the land problem has been resolved in some areas, but the masses have not been ideologically mobilized, then that is a major defect. The experiences of Dashengzhuang Village in Qiu County and Matou Village are good illustrations. In Dashengzhuang, over 90% of the farmers were organized through connection. The village cadres were eager to carry out struggle sessions, but the leadership knew that this was only the demand of a few advanced elements. After discussion, the village cadres also felt the importance of brewing bitterness, so they encouraged the farmers to pour out their grievances in group meetings. As a result of speaking bitterness, the hatred of one person turned into group hatred, and group hatred turned into the common hatred of all farmers, so the masses were extremely enthusiastic in the struggle. In Matou Village, after the landlords were detained, the method of dealing with them was discussed before the struggle, so the masses' emotions were not enthusiastic when they spoke bitterness during the initial struggle session. The landlords' evil deeds were not exposed, and the masses' awareness was not fully raised.

[Another report] Mobilizing the masses to speak bitterness has become an important part of the Kou County rent investigation and reduction movement. Each village uses "bitterness to attract bitterness," from individual bitterness to collective bitterness. Village cadres, representatives, and activists vigorously encourage those who have suffered to speak out, and some use their own bitterness to inspire others. Kangdisi Village held a meeting of the most victimized people before the general meeting, allowing those who suffered the most to speak first, in order to motivate others. During the mass mobilization last spring, the leadership's policy of ideological enlightenment was not clearly defined. In addition, because the enemy was still entrenched in the city at that time, some of the masses were afraid that the targets of the struggle would surrender to the enemy and retaliate, and they dared not speak out. In the areas bordering the enemy, such as the first and seventh districts, and parts of the second, third, and fifth districts, mass mobilization was very poor due to environmental constraints. Therefore, the county party committee proposed organizing the speaking of bitterness at the beginning of the rent reduction investigation.

　　冀南一地委发出通报
    对比两种查减方法
    比比串连诉苦于不注意诉苦那种好？
    【本报讯】冀南一地委民运部顷发出通报称：如果有的地区土地问题虽已解决，而群众并未从思想上发动起来，那就是极大缺陷。如邱县大省庄与马头村的经验是很好的说明。大省庄经过串连，组织起百分之九十以上的农民。村干部便急于要斗，但领导上深知这只是少数先进分子的要求。经过商量，村干也感到诉苦酝酿的重要，便在农民小组会上启发倒苦水。诉苦的结果，由一人的仇恨变为组仇、由组仇变为全部农民的同仇共恨，故在斗争中群众情绪极高。而马头村则是将地主扣起来后，未斗先讨论了处理办法，致初次斗争时，群众诉苦情绪不热烈，地主的恶迹未揭露，未能充分提高群众觉悟。
    【又讯】发动群众诉苦，成为寇县查减运动的重要环节。各村用“苦水引苦水”，由个别诉苦到集体诉苦。而村干部、代表、积极分子则大力启发有苦的人诉苦，有的则以自己的苦水启发别人。康地寺村于开会前召集苦主会议，让受苦最深的人先诉，以推动别人。该县在去春群众大动中，领导上对思想启发的方针提得不明确，加以当时敌人还盘据城内，一部分群众怕斗争对象投敌报复，不敢诉苦。而接敌区的一、七两区及二、三、五区的部分村庄则因环境所限，群众发动很差。故县委在查减之初即提出组织诉苦。
