　　[This paper, Taiyue, 16th] The Taiyue Military Region commended the local troops of the First Military Sub-district and the guerrilla forces in Linfen, Huoxian, and southern Shanxi for their meritorious service in annihilating the enemy, stating: Our local troops of the First Military Sub-district and the Huoxian guerrilla force, in order to coordinate with the Lüliang operations, successively captured strongholds such as Nanguan, Yangjiashan, and Dingjia Yuan last month, attacked the stubborn puppet troops in Yaowa, and frequently operated deep in the traffic lines between Fenxi and Lingshi and Huoxian, guaranteeing the connection between the Taiyue and Lüliang liberated areas, striking at the stubborn puppet troops' transportation and forced conscription and grain grabbing, and capturing stubborn puppet personnel, all with significant achievements. Our Linfen guerrilla force, since November, has responded to the call of higher authorities, coordinating with the detachment of local troops to go deep behind the enemy, repeatedly annihilating stubborn puppet troops, accumulating small victories into large ones, and exceeding the task of annihilating one platoon of the enemy. The guerrilla forces in various places in southern Shanxi have also been actively operating around the enemy's points and lines recently. In the week from the 1st to the 7th of this month, they fought seven times, annihilating more than fifty enemies. The above-mentioned troops have made meritorious service in annihilating the enemy, and are hereby commended in a circular. All local armed forces in the region should learn and promote this.
    [This paper, Taiyue, 17th] The Tunliu militia rotation team, led by Comrade Ma Fenglu, marched to the rear of the Yan puppet troops in Pingyao. In forty days, they fought more than twenty battles, large and small, killing or wounding more than thirty enemies, capturing one machine gun and several rifles, and protecting the local masses in their autumn harvest and autumn plowing. They returned victoriously on the 25th of last month, and the district office held a banquet to entertain them. Mass cadres from Queshao Village, Shangcun, and others rushed to greet them upon hearing the news, and brought peanuts, sesame candy, and other gifts to express their condolences to the heroes on the expedition. Wang Haiyu, a peasant who had been emancipated, said, "We were emancipated thanks to the Eighth Route Army, the Communist Party, and you heroes." Comrade Ma Fenglu, representing the militia expedition team, said, "It is our responsibility to protect our homes and drive away the reactionaries. It is not hard work, not hard work." Wang Zhenshan further introduced his blasting experience to everyone, saying, "Landmines are good weapons for killing enemies, and we must learn and practice blasting well in the future."
