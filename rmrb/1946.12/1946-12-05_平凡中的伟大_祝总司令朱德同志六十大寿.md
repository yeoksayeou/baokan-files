Greatness in the Ordinary
  Celebrating Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's Sixtieth Birthday
    Moye

    In the autumn of 1931, I took the Jinpu train for the first time and stopped at Taian Station. I asked a vendor at the station, "Where is Mount Tai?" He pointed to a mountain in front of me and said, "Isn't that Mount Tai!" I felt a strange astonishment at the time—why is Mount Tai so ordinary? It didn't seem particularly tall or majestic. After a while, the train started moving, and I looked out the window, gazing at the mountain, seeing it as taller and more majestic the more I looked. Focusing my attention, I began to understand the principle of finding greatness in the ordinary.

    Our Commander-in-Chief Zhu De is such an ordinary yet great figure. He is the Mount Tai of the Chinese revolutionary ranks.

    The Commander-in-Chief is very kind and generous to people. Although he is the commander of a revolutionary army, the entire army regards him as a loving mother. Once, I followed him to a cadre training team to give a report. My task was to write the outline of his report on the blackboard and categorize the many questions temporarily raised by the team members, so that he could answer them after the report. The cadre training team was about twenty li from headquarters. We went on four horses. I was walking last, and when I was about to reach my destination, I fell off because the horse was running too fast. The horse turned its head and ran back. I chased it all the way home, exhausted and unable to cry or laugh. If I went again, it would be too late; if I didn't go, the task would not be completed. In the end, I didn't go. When I saw the Commander-in-Chief the next day, I was very uneasy. He casually asked me: Why did you fall behind yesterday? I told him the details. He laughed and not only did not blame me in the slightest, but patiently told me some riding tips.

    He is "amiable" to the people, his comrades, soldiers, and cadres, but he is very "ruthless" to the counter-revolutionary enemy. At that time, there were anti-communist friction experts in North China behind enemy lines such as Zhu Huaibing and Zhang Yinwu, who colluded with the enemy and puppets. Whenever they were mentioned, the Commander-in-Chief would gnash his teeth. In this regard of "clear love and hatred," he and another national giant, Lu Xun, had similarities.

    The Commander-in-Chief liked to play basketball and would go to the sports field every day after dinner, unless there were special circumstances. On the basketball court, officers and soldiers were one. Cadres, soldiers, messengers, youngsters... all crowded onto the court. When there were too many people, they had to line up and count off, taking turns playing in batches. The Commander-in-Chief did the same. Once, the position he was standing in happened to be eleventh, and he didn't get to call out his number. The youngsters laughed, and he laughed too, quietly stepping out of line and waiting for the second time to line up. His concept of equality and spirit of abiding by discipline were naturally manifested at any time and place.

    The Commander-in-Chief sometimes played chess with guests. When the situation on his side was critical, we were a little worried when we saw it, but he was not flustered, calmly fighting, and finally turned the danger into safety, turning defeat into victory. A revolutionary military commander who had tasted hardships, endured storms, and spent his life on the battlefield, revealing a bit of "commanding calmly" demeanor between chess games, what's so strange about that!

    He was very concerned about the sufferings of the masses. Whether in the garrison or on the march, whenever he met the common people, he would kindly ask questions: Have the devils been here? If they came, were there any losses? How many people are in your family? How many acres of land do you have? How is the harvest this year? Is it enough to eat? … He often said that a good military cadre must always care about the lives of the soldiers. In the winter of 1940, he wrote a poem, preparing to have Comrade Chen Boer of the Women and Children's Comfort Group take it to the newspapers in the Great Rear Area, hoping to raise some medicine and supplies for the troops. I still remember this poem:

    Riding along the side of Taihang,
    Snow flies white in October.
    Soldiers are afraid of thin clothes,
    Killing Japanese bandits every night.

    This poem is not only old in style, even more powerful than "Heavy snow fills the drawn bow," but what is especially valuable is the great and warm revolutionary love revealed between the lines.

    Although the Commander-in-Chief is old, his spirit of learning is even better than that of the young comrades. He often carried four things with him: a pair of reading glasses, a fountain pen, a notebook, and a book. Once, a bundle of pamphlets came from outside—Lenin's "What is Marxism?" After he finished reading it, he immediately told me: "This book is very good, hurry up and distribute it to all units, every cadre must have a copy in their bag, and study it well." I did as he ordered, and a few days later he said to me again: "To arouse everyone's enthusiasm for learning, hold a large discussion meeting every week, and cadres from all units must participate." He personally directed every discussion meeting. During a period of time, cadres of the direct units studied "Imperialism," and the teacher who lectured once a week was the Commander-in-Chief. The Commander-in-Chief is worthy of the words "tireless in learning, tireless in teaching."

    The time I followed the Commander-in-Chief was very short. On the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, recalling some of the bits and pieces of his life is just a slight expression of admiration and remembrance. The things are all very ordinary, but the greatness of the Commander-in-Chief lies precisely in these ordinary places!

### 平凡中的伟大　祝总司令朱德同志六十大寿

　　平凡中的伟大
  　祝总司令朱德同志六十大寿
    漠野
    三一年秋，第一次乘津浦车，停泰安站。我问站上的一个小贩：“泰山在那里？”他指着前面的一座山告我：“那不就是泰山吗！”我当时感到一种莫名的惊异——泰山为什么如此平凡呢？既不见得高大，也似乎并不雄伟。一会见，车开动了，我凭窗远眺，望着那座山，愈看愈显得高大，愈看愈显得雄伟，瞩目凝神，我开始领悟了平凡中见伟大的道理。
    我们的总司令朱德同志，就是这么一位最平凡也最伟大的人物，他是中国革命队伍中的泰山。
    总司令对人非常和蔼而宽大，他虽然是一个革命军队的统帅，但全军都把他看作慈爱的母亲。有一次，我跟随他到一个干训队去作报告，我的任务是替他老人家将报告提纲写在黑板上，并类别队员们临时提出的许多问题，以便他报告后予以解答。干训队离总部约二十里，我们是骑着四匹马去的，我走在最后，快达目的地时，因为马跑得太快，我摔下来了，马一股劲回头跑，我一直追到了家里，精疲力尽，啼哭皆非。再去吧，时间已经晚了，不去吧，任务没有完成，结果还是没去。第二天见到总司令时，我心中非常不安。他随便的问了我一句：昨天怎么掉了队？我告以详情，他老人家笑了，不但未加丝毫责难，反而耐心地给我讲了一些骑马的要诀。
    他对人民、自己的同志、战士与干部是“和”的，但对于反革命的敌人却是非常之“狠”。当时华北敌后有朱怀冰、张荫梧那些勾结敌伪的反共摩擦专家，一提起他们来，总司令就咬牙切齿。“爱憎分明”这一点，他与另一位民族巨人鲁迅是有其相似之处的。
    总司令喜欢打篮球，每天晚饭后都要上运动场，除非是有特殊事故。篮球场上是官兵一体的，干部、战士、通讯员、小鬼……济济一场。人一多了，就要站队报数，分批轮流打。总司令也一样站队报数。有一次他站的地位恰恰是个第十一名，没有报上，小鬼们笑了，他老人家自己也笑了，静悄悄地走出线外等待着第二次站队。他的平等观念与遵守纪律的精神，就是这样随时随地自自然然表现出来的。
    总司令有时同客人下棋，当自己这方面局势危急的时候，我们在旁边看到都有点耽心，但他老人家却不慌不忙，沉着应战，终于转危为安，转败为胜，一个备尝艰险，饱经风浪，戎马一生的革命军事统帅，棋局之间显露出一点“指挥若定”的风度来，又有什么奇怪呢！
    他非常关心群众疾苦，无论在驻地或行军途中，一遇到老百姓，就亲切地问长问短：鬼子来过没有，来了损失没有，家里几口人，几亩地，今年收成怎样，够吃不够吃？……他常常说，一个好的军事干部必须时刻关心战士们的生活。四○年冬天，他写了一首诗，准备交由妇女儿童慰劳团的陈波儿同志带到大后方的报纸上去发表，希望替部队募捐一些医药、物品。这首诗我至今还记得：
    走马太行侧　　    十月雪飞白
    战士怯衣单　　    夜夜杀倭贼
    这一首诗不仅风格苍老，较“大雪满弓刀”更为沉雄，而尤其可贵的，是那流露于字里行间的伟大热烈的革命友爱的温暖。
    总司令虽然上了年纪，但其学习精神却较之青年同志，有过之而无不及。他老人家身边经常带着四件东西：一付老花眼镜，一枝自来水笔，一个笔记本，一本书。有一次，外边来了一捆小册子——列宁著的“什么是马克斯主义？”他看完了马上告诉我：“这本书非常好，赶快分发给各单位，每个干部的包包里都要揣一本，好好学习。”我遵嘱办了，过了几天又对我讲：“要引起大家学习的热情，以后每星期开一次大讨论会，各单位干部都要参加”。每次讨论会他老人家都亲临指导。有一个时期，直属队干部学习“帝国主义论”，每周授课一次的教师，就是总司令。“学而不厌，诲人不倦”这八个字总司令足以当之。
    我追随总司令的时日很短，当他老人家六十寿辰，追述他生活中的一些点滴，不过是略表一点敬佩怀慕之忱而已。事情都是很平凡的，但总司令的伟大处，却正在这些平凡的地方啊！
