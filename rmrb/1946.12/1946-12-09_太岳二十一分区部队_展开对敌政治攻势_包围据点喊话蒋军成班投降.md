　　Taiyue 21st Military Sub-district Troops
  　Launch Political Offensive Against the Enemy
  　Surround Strongholds, Persuading Chiang's Soldiers to Surrender by Squad
    [Our Newspaper News] In the self-defense war, the Taiyue 21st Military Sub-district troops carried out political offensives, frequently conducting propaganda, writing slogans, and shouting at the enemy, achieving significant results. The 3rd Regiment troops shouted across the river, and the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment also continuously surrounded strongholds and shouted, deeply moving the Chiang soldiers entrenched on the border of Ji and Meng, who then defected to our Liberated Area by squads. In order to further promote the movement of propaganda, writing slogans, and shouting, the sub-district issued instructions emphasizing that it is necessary to clearly recognize that politically disarming the enemy is of equal importance to militarily repelling and annihilating them through self-defense counterattacks. A powerful political offensive will enable a more victorious military annihilation of the enemy. Four specific suggestions were put forward: (1) All commanders, fighters, and political workers must clearly understand the importance and necessity of the propaganda offensive. (2) Organize forces effectively. (3) Conduct timely supervision, inspection, and summarize experiences. (4) Study in detail the Military Region's instructions on shouting at the enemy's positions and writing slogans, combined with the issues raised by the sub-district. Finally, the comrades are called upon to write slogans wherever they go, deliver the propaganda materials undamaged into the hands of the invading soldiers, and not to let go of any opportunity to shout, hold meetings, and use the justice of our self-defense counterattacks and the truth of defending peace and democracy to break through all the deceptions and lies that Chiang Kai-shek uses on his soldiers.

　　太岳二十一分区部队
  　展开对敌政治攻势
  　包围据点喊话蒋军成班投降
    【本报讯】太岳二十一分区部队在自卫战争中进行政治攻势，经常对敌宣传、写标语、喊话，获得很大成绩。三团部队曾隔河喊话，二团一营亦不断包围据点喊话，盘据济孟边境的蒋军深受感动，成班逃来我解放区。该分区为更进一步开展宣传、写标语、喊话运动，特发出指示强调指出：必须明确认识从政治上解除敌人武装与军事上的自卫反击歼灭敌人，具有同等重要意义，有力的政治攻势，会使军事上更加胜利的歼灭敌人。并提出四个具体意见：（一）要使全体指战员、政工人员明确的认识宣传攻势的重要与必需。（二）很好的组织力量。（三）按时的进行督促检查与总结经验。（四）把军区关于对进犯军阵地喊话和写标语工作的指示，结合分区所提的问题详细研究。最后号召同志们走到那里把标语写到那里，把宣传品毫不损坏的送到进犯军的手中，不放松一点时机进行喊话、开会，用我们自卫反击的正义性与保卫和平民主的真理来打破蒋介石对其士兵的一切蒙蔽和欺骗。
