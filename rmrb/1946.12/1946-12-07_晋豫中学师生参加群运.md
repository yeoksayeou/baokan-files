　　Jin-Yu Middle School Teachers and Students
    Participate in Mass Movement
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd dispatch] In order to help the farmers of Jincheng quickly realize "land to the tiller," and to train themselves in the mass movement to integrate teaching with practice, Jin-Yu Middle School convened a school affairs meeting on the 16th of last month to specifically discuss the school's attitude and relationship to the mass movement. On the 18th, they invited Zheng, the political commissar of Jincheng, to report on the situation of the mass movement work and the guidelines for the mass movement. Then, they divided into groups and classes to展开热烈讨论，automatically sign up to participate in the mass movement. More than 100 students, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of comrades in the school, decided to stay in school to study due to their young age or illness. These students, led by the principal and the heads of the four districts, have gone to the first, third, and fifth districts of Jincheng to start work.
