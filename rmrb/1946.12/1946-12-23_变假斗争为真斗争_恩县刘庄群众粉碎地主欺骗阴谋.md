　　Turning False Struggle into Real Struggle
    Liu Zhuang Masses in Enxian County Smash Landlord's Conspiracy of Deception
    [Report from our newspaper in Weixian, 19th] The masses of Liu Zhuang in the Fourth District of Enxian County, after smashing the landlord's conspiracy of false struggle, have achieved victory in their liberation. The feudal ruling power in this village was strong, and it had long been a "blank" village. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the landlord Liu Enpei colluded with puppet bandits to manipulate village administration, embezzle and extort, and cruelly oppress the masses. His land increased from 60 mu to more than 300 mu. Surrounding villages suffered from his bloody rule. Before our cadres arrived in the village, Liu Enpei had his henchman (a poor man) appointed as village head and bought off the poor peasant Liu En to serve as director of the peasant association. He also established six fake militia members, and then organized a fake struggle, claiming to the masses that he had been detained by the peasant association. He took out 800 jin of grain, 700 jin of cotton, and 30 mu of land, and quickly distributed the grain and cotton to the poor, while the land was kept by the peasant association and not distributed. After the cadres arrived in the village, some people said, "Our village has already carried out the struggle." After further investigation, some poor people reported, "The landlord said that if there is another struggle, firstly, the Eighth Route Army will want the fruits of the struggle, and secondly, outsiders will come to divide the things of our Liu Zhuang." The cadres immediately convened a mass meeting, exposing the landlord's conspiracy, and discovered that the director of the peasant association was constantly obstructing, both openly and secretly. That evening, Liu Enpei again manipulated his henchmen to secretly detain the masses who had the most grievances. Discovering this problem, the cadres immediately cooperated with the masses to detain the fake director of the peasant association, and convened a meeting of poor peasants, victims, and hired laborers to mobilize them. A certain retired soldier who had fought for eight years during the War of Resistance Against Japan was elected as the director of the peasant association. Immediately afterwards, the internal affairs of the peasant association were reorganized, doglegs and feudal rich peasants were purged, and an oath was taken. Over two days, 108 male and female members were developed. Then, a grievance-airing struggle was launched against the landlord, with people from nine nearby villages participating, and the struggle achieved victory. A total of more than 340 mu of land were struggled out. Influenced by this victory, the mass movement is unfolding in Class I villages, which were previously active in espionage and were subject to the strict rule of landlords.

　　变假斗争为真斗争
    恩县刘庄群众粉碎地主欺骗阴谋
    【本报威县十九日电】恩县四区刘庄群众，粉碎地主假斗争阴谋后，获得翻身的胜利。该村封建统治力量强大，长期是空白村，抗战中地主刘恩沛勾结伪匪，操纵村政，贪污讹诈，残害群众，其土地由六十亩增到三百余亩，周围村庄都受他的血腥统治，我们的干部未到该村前，刘恩沛即叫他的一个腿子（穷人）当村长，收买贫农刘恩担任农会主任，还成立了六个假民兵，然后组织假斗争，自向群众扬言自己被农会扣起来，拿出谷子八百斤、棉花七百斤、地三十亩，把棉粮很快分给穷人，土地叫农会保存，不叫分。干部到该村后，有些人就说：“俺村斗争过了。”后经深入调查，听到有些穷人反映：“地主说如再斗争，一是八路军要斗争果实，二是外村也来分咱刘庄的东西”。干部随即召开群众大会，揭露地主阴谋，发现农会主任不断明暗拦阻。当日晚上刘恩沛又操纵他暗中将诉苦最多的群众扣起来了。干部发现这个问题，即协同群众，将假农会主任扣押起来，并召开贫农、苦主、雇工会议，进行动员，选了抗战八年的退伍军人某某当农会主任，紧接着整理了农会内部，清洗了狗腿和带封建性的富农，进行了宣誓。经过两天时间，发展了男女会员一百零八名，又对地主展开诉苦斗争，附近九个村的群众都来参加，斗争乃获得胜利。共斗出土地三百四十多亩。在这次胜利影响下，以前特务活跃，地主统治极严的一类村庄，群众运动局面正在开展。
