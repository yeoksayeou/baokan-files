　　Central Bureau Cables Congratulations on the Subei Victory
    Praising it as a Model Battle for Large-Scale Annihilation of Chiang's Elite Troops
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Central Bureau of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region cabled congratulations to the New Fourth Army on the great victory on the Subei front. The original cable stated: Comrade Chen Yi, and please forward to all commanders and fighters on the Subei front:
    In this great battle on the northern Jiangsu-Anhui front, you annihilated as many as four brigades of invading Chiang's troops. This brilliant victory not only shattered Chiang's troops' arrogant attempt to occupy our Subei Liberated Area, and encouraged the people of Huaihai to stand up and defend land reform, but also created a battle model for large-scale annihilation of Chiang's elite troops. It fully proves the military and political bankruptcy crisis of the Chiang bandits, and marks that the strategic situation of our people's self-defense war's comprehensive counter-offensive is even closer. The good news has arrived, and the soldiers and civilians of our entire region are extremely excited. A special cable is sent to express our congratulations!

　　中央局电贺苏北大捷
    誉为大规模歼灭蒋军嫡系的战役范例
    【本报讯】中共晋冀鲁豫中央局电贺苏北前线新四军大捷，原电称：陈毅同志并请转苏北前线全体指战员同志们：
    你们在这次苏皖北线大战中，歼灭进犯蒋军达四个旅之众，这一辉煌胜利，不仅粉碎了蒋军侵占我苏北解放区的狂妄企图，鼓舞了淮海人民翻身与保卫着土地改革，而且创造了大规模歼灭蒋军嫡系部队的战役范例，完全证明蒋贼军事与政治的破产危机，并标志着我人民自卫战全面反攻的战略形势已更加接近。捷报传来，我全区军民，振奋莫名，特电驰贺！
          （十二月二十日）
