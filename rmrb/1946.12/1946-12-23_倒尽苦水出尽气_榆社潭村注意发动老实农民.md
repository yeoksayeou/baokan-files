　　"Pour Out All Bitterness and Vent All Anger"
    Yushe Tancun Pays Attention to Mobilizing Honest Farmers
    [Report from Changzhi by our newspaper] Tancun Village, Yishe District, underwent a major transformation in the first half of this year, but after this inspection, it was found that the feudal clique had not yet been defeated, and more than ten households of farmers who had not yet been liberated had not been mobilized. Based on these circumstances, the leadership conducted a detailed study and decided to start with poor and honest farmers to inspire their self-awareness. Therefore, individual visits were conducted to inquire about their suffering, using bitterness to attract bitterness, from small groups to large meetings. The slogan was: "Pour out all bitterness and vent all anger, thoroughly defeat feudalism, even if the sky falls, the farmers will hold it up, recognize the feudal forces, and fight to the death." After five or six days of visiting and recounting grievances, mass meetings were held successively around the sixth and seventh days. More than a dozen old men in their sixties were all weeping sadly. Ninety percent of the farmers were involved in this movement and launched a struggle to denounce the feudal landlords. Lu Sizhu recounted that before the war, Qiao Wanhhu falsely accused him of being a thief, not only sending him to the district detention center but also making him compensate the person with one and a half dou of wheat. Qiao Buxian recounted that Qiao Wanhu extinguished his family and seized his property. Gong San'gang recounted that Qiao Wanhu and Wang Xiaowen colluded with the enemy and had the enemy kill more than thirty people, creating the Huanglongjiaopo incident, and threatened the masses to maintain the enemy and kill two cadres. At this point, the masses in the audience were extremely indignant and unanimously proposed that blood debts must be paid with blood, and that the evil blood-sucking demon kings must be overthrown. Under the angry roars of the masses, the wicked feudal leaders Qiao Wanhhu and Wang Xiaowen bowed their heads to the masses. The masses then proposed to liquidate the ten ruling sheshou (feudal clique), and the movement is now surging to a climax.

　　“倒尽苦水出尽气”
    榆社潭村注意发动老实农民
    【本报长治讯】榆社一区潭村今年前半年进行了一次大翻身，但经这次检查，发现封建集团尚未打垮，未翻身的农民尚有十余户没有发动，领导上根据这些情况，作了详细研究，决定首先从贫苦老实农民着手，启发其自觉。因之进行了个别访苦，以苦引苦，由小组到大会。提出口号是：“倒尽苦水出尽气，彻底打垮封建，天塌下来有农民顶，认清封建势力，拚个你死我活”。经过了五六天的访苦诉苦，在六、七日左右相继召开了群众大会，有十几个六十来岁的老汉都是诉的伤心掉泪，百分之九十的农民都卷入了这一运动，向封建地主展开了诉苦斗争。鹿四珠诉出战前乔万虎诬良为盗，把他送到区上坐看守所不说，还得赔人家一斗半麦子。乔步献诉出乔万虎灭门霸产。巩三岗诉出乔万虎、王效文勾结敌人叫敌人杀了三十多人，造成黄龙角坡事件，并威胁群众维持敌人，杀死干部二人。诉到这里，全场群众愤恨已极，一致提出血债要用血来还，打倒恶毒吃人血的魔王。在群众的怒吼下，万恶的封建头子乔万虎、王效文向群众低了头。群众又提出清算十家统治社首（封建集团），运动现正涌向高潮。
