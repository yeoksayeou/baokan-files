　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Late news from Rome: Italy held local elections on the 12th of this month, and the left-wing parties won in the Senate. In the Rome Provincial Council elections, the "People's Group" composed of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and two other left-wing parties took the lead. In Florence, the Communist Party received more than 64,000 votes, ranking first. The red flag has been raised high above the Palazzo Vecchio. An American news agency reporter called the election results "a failure of Western democracy," saying that it was of equal importance to the victory of the French Communist Party in the French general election.

    Another news item: The Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party have formed an electoral alliance at the beginning of this month to prepare for the spring parliamentary elections, putting forward a common program, which includes eliminating the remnants of fascism, consolidating the democratic republic, nationalizing large enterprises, implementing land reform, and establishing a collective security foreign policy.

　　意共与社会党联盟准备明春国会选举
    【新华社延安二十九日电】罗马迟到消息：本月十二日，意大利举行地方选举，左派各党在参议会中获胜。在罗马州议会选举中，共产党、社会党及其他两个左派政党组成之“人民集团”占头位。在翡冷翠城，共产党得六万四千余票，高居首位。红旗已高悬于维凯奥古宫上。美新闻处记者称此次选举结果为“西方民主的失败”，并谓其与法国大选中法共获胜有同等重要意义。
    另讯：意共与社会党为准备明春国会选举，已于本月初结成选举联盟，提出共同纲领，其中有肃清法西斯残余巩固民主共合国，大企业国有化，实行土地改革，确立集体安全外交政策等等。
