　　Grasp Ideological Education, Overcome "Get Rich Quick" Tendencies
    East Wa Successfully Completes Filling
    [Our newspaper Changzhi dispatch] The land investigation and rent reduction movement in Dongwa Village, Licheng, has been successfully concluded. All 44 poor peasant households in the village who lacked land and housing have been filled in. Not only did more than 90% of the villagers share the fruits of the struggle, but also villagers from other villages were taken care of. During the movement, ideological education was firmly grasped, dispelling the masses' muddled thinking of "getting rich quick" and strengthening the unity of the peasants. At the beginning of the land investigation and rent reduction in the village, the leadership proposed to "cut off" the tails and fill the holes, thoroughly eliminate feudalism, and realize "land to the tiller." The enthusiasm of the masses was extremely high, and they spontaneously colluded and brewed. However, at the same time, the muddled thinking of "getting rich quick" arose. Many peasants believed that all those who were wealthy and leased land and lent money were feudal forces and should be eliminated. This caused anxiety among emerging rich peasants and middle peasants. After the village cadres discovered this, they immediately convened a meeting of members of the Peasant Association to discuss what feudal forces were and whose tails should be cut off. One member said: "I think landlord Guo Chengzhen is a feudal force. He served as the village head for 19 years and exploited 13 peasant households in our village with high rents and heavy interest. He should be thoroughly liquidated. People like Guo Tufeng have been hired laborers all their lives, accumulated nine yuan and lent it out; Guo Futian and his mother are both old and weak and unable to farm the land, so they rent out four mu of thin land to others to farm. They are all poor people. It is completely different from landlord Guo Chengzhen, who relies on lending money and leasing land to exploit others for enjoyment, and they should not be liquidated." In this way, everyone clarified that "cutting off the tail" mainly meant cutting off those who relied on exploiting others for enjoyment. Those who became rich through labor should not be liquidated. After the goal was clarified, a public accusation and liquidation was launched against the big landlord Guo Chengzhen. A symposium and arbitration approach was adopted to resolve the feudal exploitation issues of five old rich peasant households. The issues of tenancy and debt of individual middle and poor peasants were resolved by the Peasant Association through clear explanations. In this way, the broad masses of peasants were very happy, and the five old rich peasants also said: "What is there to fear about getting rich as long as you don't exploit others?" In total, the peasants recovered blood and sweat fruits of: 120 mu of land, one house, nine cave dwellings, and clothing worth 1.8 million yuan. When distributing the fruits, all the peasants expressed their opinions and unanimously agreed to first distribute items worth 200,000 yuan to poor brothers in other villages. The villagers were divided according to the principle of "filling in what is lacking." As a result, 91 out of 96 households in the village received fruits. Nineteen households without houses had houses to live in, and 25 households without land had enough land to maintain their lives. Everyone was overjoyed and is now actively engaged in winter production.

　　抓紧思想教育  克服“斗富”偏向
    东洼胜利完成填补
    【本报长治讯】黎城东洼村查减运动已胜利结束，全村四十四户缺地没房的贫农均已填平，不仅本村百分之九十以上群众分得果实，且照顾了外村群众。运动中抓紧了思想教育，解除了群众“斗富”的糊涂思想，加强了农民的团结。该村查减开始时，领导上提出“割”尾巴，填窟窿，彻底消灭封建，实现耕者有其田，群众情绪极高，自动串通酝酿，但同时即产生了“斗富”的糊涂思想，许多农民认为凡是富有者与出租土地放账者，都是封建势力，均应当消灭。因此引起新兴富农与中农的不安。村干部发觉后，即召开农会会员大会，讨论什么是封建势力，应当割那些人的尾巴等问题。一个会员说：“我认为地主郭成珍就是封建势力，他当过十九年村长，高租重利剥削穷咱村十三户农民，应当彻底清算他。像郭土逢一辈当长工，积下九块钱放出去；郭付田母子两人，老小无力种地，把四亩薄地租给别人种，他们都是些穷人，和地主郭成珍长靠放账出租土地剥削别人来享福是完全不一样的，不能清算他们。”这一来大家明确了“割尾巴”主要是割靠剥削人来享受的人。劳动发家的人不应当清算。目标明确后，即对大地主郭成珍展开诉苦清算，对五户旧富农则采取座谈仲裁的方式，解决其封建剥削部分的问题。个别中贫农的租佃、债务问题，在农会把话说明白解决。这样广大农民都很高兴，五户老富农也说：“只要不剥削人，发财怕什么。”总计这次最后清算，农民共收回血汗果实有：地一百二十亩，房子一间，窑九孔，衣物等价一百八十万元。在分配果实时，全体农民都发表了意见，一致赞成先以二十万元的东西分给外村穷兄弟。本村群众则按缺什分什的原则，实行“填补”，结果全村九十六户，即有九十一户分得果实。十九户没房的有了房住，二十五户没地的有了足以维持生活的土地。人人大喜  ，现正积极进行冬季生产。
