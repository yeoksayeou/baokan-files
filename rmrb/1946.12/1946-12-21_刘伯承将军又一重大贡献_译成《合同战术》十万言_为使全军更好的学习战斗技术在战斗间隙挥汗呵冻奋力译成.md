　　General Liu Bocheng's Another Significant Contribution
    Translated "Combined Tactics" with 100,000 Words
    To Enable the Entire Army to Better Learn Combat Techniques, He Diligently Translated It Amidst Battles, Sweating and Huddling Against the Cold
    [This newspaper's front-line dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu, 16th] Authoritative military strategist General Liu Bocheng has recently completed the translation of the second half of the book "Combined Tactics" amidst his busy military schedule, totaling 100,000 words. This is another significant contribution by General Liu in the last hundred days, in addition to annihilating eleven brigades of the Chiang army. This book specifically discusses the performance and usage of weapons and how to counter them. It is an authoritative Soviet work, published in 1942. General Liu originally intended to wait for the latest version, hoping to include more up-to-date materials, so he delayed starting the translation. Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas in July with a large number of American weapons. General Liu began the translation immediately, during the extremely busy self-defense war. General Liu said, "We originally didn't have new weapons, so we couldn't talk about using them. But we should know how to counter them; this is most important to us." In the past hundred days, General Liu has been campaigning on the Ji-Lu-Yu plains, winning all five battles, averaging one battle every twenty days. In addition, he injured his left eye on the battlefield during the campaign against Yuan Shikai twenty years ago, making writing very inconvenient. However, General Liu deeply felt his glorious responsibility to the Chinese people, which he could not shirk. So, in his spare time from planning, from the heat of summer to the severe winter, he sweated and huddled against the cold, diligently translating this book. This kind of great spirit and courage is enough to make Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk shudder; and it can make the people of the whole country deeply grateful and quickly learn. (Li Pu)

　　刘伯承将军又一重大贡献
    译成《合同战术》十万言
    为使全军更好的学习战斗技术在战斗间隙挥汗呵冻奋力译成
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十六日电】权威军事学家刘伯承将军顷在戎马倥惚之中完成《合同战术》一书下半部之翻译，计十万字。此为一百天来刘将军歼灭蒋军十一个旅之外又一重大贡献。这部书专论兵器之性能与使用法及如何对抗它。是苏联的权威著作，一九四二年出版，刘将军原拟等待最近的版本，希望能收容更多更新的材料，所以迟迟没有动笔。不料蒋介石于七月间以大量的美国武器开始大举进攻解放区，刘蒋军在极度繁忙的自卫战争中，稍有空隙立即开始译作。刘将军说：“我们原本没有新式武器，谈不上使用。但应该知道如何对抗它的方法；这一点对我们最重要。”一百天来，刘将军驰聘于冀鲁豫大平原上，五战五捷，平均每二十天作战一次，加之二十年前讨袁之役在战场上伤其左目，写作甚感不便。但刘将军深深感到他自己对中国人民的光荣责任，无所旁贷，就在运筹之暇，自炎夏以至隆冬，挥汗呵冻，把这部书奋力译成。此种伟大的精神与魄力，实足令蒋介石之辈不寒而栗；更可使全国人民深深感激而急起学习。（李普）
