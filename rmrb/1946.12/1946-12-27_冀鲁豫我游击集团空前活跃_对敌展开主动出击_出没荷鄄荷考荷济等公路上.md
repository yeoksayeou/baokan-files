[Reported by our correspondent in JiluYu on the 24th] One of the characteristics of the current JiluYu battlefield is the unprecedented activity of our guerrilla groups, attacking and ambushing the enemy to achieve results. The enemy and puppets are being beaten everywhere, exhausted and scurrying about.

On the 2nd, our Yuncheng and Juye guerrilla teams fiercely attacked the bandit Xue Laibin's unit in Xiaoguantun, capturing 44 alive, killing 2, and seizing 38 rifles, 1 small cannon, and 3 warhorses. On the same day, the Caoxian guerrilla team of our Fifth Sub-district suddenly attacked the puppet Third District headquarters in Cuizhongji north of the city, killing 10 enemies and seizing 11 long and short guns. On the 3rd, a regiment of Jiang’s Sixty-eighth Army in Heze, in coordination with more than 2,000 puppet troops, advanced on us in two routes. Part of our local armed forces counterattacked with mobility. One enemy route retreated southeast from Gehezhuang, and the other fled northeast to Guaizi Lin. Our certain work team pursued the victory, killing more than 30 enemies, wounding more than 10, and capturing 3 alive. On the 5th, the guerrillas of the Fourth Sub-district attacked the stubborn puppet Wang Sanzhu's unit in Shiyuan, 40 li north of Changyuan, killing and wounding 20 enemies and capturing 9.

Puyang area: At noon on the 10th, more than 10 members of our guerrilla team encountered more than 30 members of the puppet Fourth District Self-Defense Regiment in Qigongzhai, Puyang. They immediately killed the head of the Self-Defense Regiment, Su Quanzeng, captured more than 20 enemies, and seized 20 guns. On the 11th, more than 10 members of the puppet district headquarters held a conscription meeting in Malengping. A platoon of our certain guerrilla detachment ambushed in Donglengping, capturing the enemy company commander Li Zhenkai and seizing two people and two guns. On the evening of the same day, the guerrilla detachment also defeated Sun Yude and Liu Chen's conscription team of the enemy in Dongxingong, capturing two people and two guns. On the morning of the 14th, our guerrilla corps fiercely attacked more than 400 enemy troops who were advancing on us, killing and wounding more than 30 enemies, with no casualties on our side.

Southwestern Shandong area: Our guerrilla corps, active in the Jining, Jiaxiang, Yutai, Jinxiang, and Caoxian areas, annihilated two companies of stubborn puppets at Xingfuji (40 li north of Jinxiang) at dawn on the 11th, capturing more than 100 enemies and seizing more than 100 rifles, with only 7 of our men slightly wounded. More than 2,000 enemy security brigades and puppet district armed forces from Caoxian attacked the Weiwanzhuanmiao area of Caoxian in three routes on the 15th. Our local Eighth Route Army and militia guerrillas rose up to meet the attack, killing and wounding more than 30 enemies, and the enemy fled back to Caoxian city in a panic.

On both sides of the Hekao and Hejuan highways and in the central area of ​​western Shandong, our guerrilla groups launched proactive attacks against the enemy, achieving 11 victories in a row from November 16th to 21st. On the 16th, a company of the Changyuan puppet security police brigade, in coordination with the Dongming puppet brigade and the "Homecoming Corps," totaling more than 600 people, launched a joint attack on a certain unit of our troops stationed in Yaozhuang. They made contact with our scouts in Liulou. From 6:00 am to dark, we launched four consecutive counterattacks, completely defeating the enemy. The enemy dragged 22 banners and fled in panic. At 11:00 am on the 17th, more than 300 troops of the local tyrant Guo Qiyun in Caoxian attacked our troops stationed in Weiwan. More than 30 of our cavalrymen counterattacked, seizing 8 rifles and more than 200 bullets, capturing 2 enemies, and killing more than 10 enemies. The Heze militia ambushed more than 200 troops of a certain regiment of Jiang’s Fifth Army in Juanpengmiao on the 21st. On the 20th, our militia guerrillas attacked the Gaoguyun stronghold, capturing 34 members of the Homecoming Corps. On the same day, our Qibin guerrilla team annihilated 18 members of the Homecoming Corps, seizing more than 10 guns. The Nanhua local armed forces intercepted the Third Battalion of a certain regiment of Jiang’s Fifth Army advancing westward near Jieyuanji on the afternoon of the 20th, capturing 9 enemies. On the 21st, the stubborn security brigade from Caoxian reinforced westward and was intercepted by a certain unit of our Caoxian, killing more than 130 enemies, with only 2 of our men injured and 1 killed. In the vast central area of ​​southwestern Shandong, under the combined attacks of our army and people, the puppet stubborn elements fled one after another, and vast areas were re-liberated.
