	The Border Region Government Education Department Continues to Solicit Works; Award Ceremony Postponed

	[Our Newspaper] The Border Region Government Education Department's solicitation of cultural and educational works has yielded significant results. Over the past six months, it has successively received over a hundred submissions (novels, poems, dramas, quick talks, cartoons, woodcuts, primary and secondary school textbooks, stories of the people's liberation, and heroic battle deeds, etc.). Submissions continue to arrive. The award ceremony was originally scheduled for the end of December, but the Self-Defense War and the emancipation movement of the past six months have been magnificent and unprecedented. New creations are sure to be numerous. To make the awards more comprehensive and enable writers depicting the war and mass movements to participate, the deadline has been extended. Letters have been sent to the education departments of various administrative regions and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to widely solicit submissions. (Min)

　　边府教厅继续征集作品
    评奖延期
    【本报讯】边府教育厅征集文教作品，已获重要成绩。半年来陆续收到应征作品（小说、诗歌、戏剧、快板、漫画、木刻、中小学教材、人民的翻身故事及英勇的战斗事迹等）一百余件，现仍不断的寄来。评奖工作原定于十二月底揭晓，但半年来自卫战争与翻身运动，雄伟壮烈，史无前例，新的创作当不在少数，为使评奖普遍，使描写战争及群运的作家能参加评奖，特将时间延长。并已分函各行政区教育处及文联广为征集。（民）
