    Visiting Chongqing's "Demobilization Station"
    By the beginning of last month, over ten thousand disabled soldiers, demobilized by the Kuomintang from the civil war front lines, had already arrived in Chongqing. Subsequently, several thousand more arrived. The Chiang government established five "demobilization stations" in Sichuan: Chongqing, Wanxian, Luzhou, Huayang, and Guangyuan. The "demobilization station" here was ordered to quickly send the disabled soldiers out of the area. The "demobilization station" entrance was crowded with soldiers demanding their pay, some of whom had not received it for three months.
    The Chongqing "demobilization station" is located in Haitangxi, a suburb. The reporter visited disabled soldiers for three days, interviewing over a hundred. Once, in a teahouse, Squad Leader Chen, a sergeant from the 146th Brigade, spoke about the fighting power of the People's Liberation Army, saying, "The Communist army is very good at fighting. Last year in Anhui, when our three regiments advanced to not far from Lingbi and attacked, the New Fourth Army disappeared. In the middle of the night, the New Fourth Army started fighting behind us. We quickly retreated to the woods. There was gunfire everywhere. The two regiments in front ran away, and our 437th Regiment was completely surrounded and defeated." Private Yang, a first-class soldier from the 19th Regiment of the New 7th Brigade, said, "The New Fourth Army is really good at fighting. This August, near Jiangyin, one battle finished our brigade in half an hour. Deputy Brigade Commander Tian Congyun committed suicide." (Note: Brigade Commander Tian was captured by the New Fourth Army during a forced battle in Nantong and now resides peacefully in a certain area of the Jiangsu-Anhui border region.) "Regiment Commander Xie of the 20th Regiment was taken prisoner."
    A tea-drinking customer asked, "Do they kill the prisoners they capture?" They all responded with a chorus of "No, no." Soldier Zhang of the 19th Regiment said, "After Regiment Commander Xie was captured, the New Fourth Army even gave him money to return." Soldier Zhao of the 99th Division chimed in, "The Communist army doesn't kill people. When we were on the front lines in Taixing, northern Jiangsu, the New Fourth Army even invited us to cross their lines to play. The brave ones went over, and they welcomed us to eat. Many people went over in the evening, and they were all very polite and smiling." Someone in the teahouse asked, "Is the New Fourth Army good to the common people?" Squad Leader Li of the 55th Regiment said, "You can't tell the Communist soldiers apart from the common people. Once, a squad of us was resting on the road, and an old man invited us to smoke and chat. Someone behind him shouted, 'Don't move!' He also drew his gun and pointed it at us, saying, 'Quickly surrender your guns, everyone behind us is our people.' We obediently surrendered our guns, and upon looking around, there were only four people, all commoners."
    Zhang from the New 7th Brigade, who fought around Jiangyin, said, "When the Communist army didn't arrive, some landlords fled. Who knew that the landlords escaping was no big deal, I even saw landlords who hadn't fled standing by the fields, nothing happened to them. Those who fled were detained by our army." Of the hundred or so soldiers the reporter contacted, most knew that the Communist Party could not be eliminated. A soldier from Gaoliang said, "Every time we fight the Communists, there's no good 'cheap stuff' (Sichuan dialect meaning 'advantage'). Many people didn't die fighting external wars, but many people die fighting internal wars. The Communist army seized many guns from the Japanese and also seized many guns from us. They have become big, with more guns, more people, and the common people are all theirs." They generally do not want civil war. They came back from the Wuhu area, saw the common people there being drafted, and thinking of their own drafting experiences in the past, expressed boundless sympathy in their words. A soldier from the 21st Army said, "Who wants to fight then? We're the ones who die, and the high officials are the ones who get promoted." He held up his injured right hand and raised it to everyone, saying, "Only those who want to extinguish their family line would want to fight a civil war."

    访问重庆的“复员站”
    国民党从内战前线遣散下来的残废士兵，上月初仅已到重庆的即达万余人，以后续又到数千人，蒋政府在四川设立重庆、万县、泸州、华阳、广元等五个“复员站”。此间“复员站”奉命迅速遣送残废兵出境，“复员站”门前拥挤着要薪饷的士兵，有的三个月未领饷了。
    重庆“复员站”设市郊海棠溪，记者前往访问残废士兵三天，接谈的在百人以上。一次在一个茶馆里，一四六旅的中士班长陈某谈到人民解放军的战斗力，他说：“共产党的军队很能打，去年在安徽，我们三个团开到灵璧不远的地方一打，新四军就不见了，半夜新四军在我们后面打起来，我们赶快退至树林里，到处枪响了，前面两团跑掉了，我们四三七团完全被包围打垮了。”新七旅一九团的一等兵杨某说：“新四军真能打，今年八月在江阴附近一仗，我们一个旅打半个钟头就完了，副旅长田从云自杀了，（按田旅长在南通被迫战斗中为新四军所俘获，现安居苏皖边区某地。）二○团谢团长当了俘虏。”
    一个吃茶的客人问“捉到俘虏杀不杀呢？”他们一齐发出不不的声音。一九团士兵张某说：“谢团长被俘去，新四军还拿钱给他回来。”九九师士兵赵某抢着说：“共产党军队是不杀人的，我们在苏北泰兴前线，新四军还叫我们过他们阵地去玩，胆大的过去，他们还欢迎吃饭，晚上很多人过去，他们都很客气，笑嘻嘻的。”茶馆里有人问“新四军对老百姓好不好？”五五团姓李的班长说：“共军和老百姓分不出来，有一回我们一个班在路上休息，一个老百姓招待我们吃烟，摆龙门阵，他后面有人喊‘不准动’。他也把枪抽出来对着我们说：‘快缴枪，后面都是我们的人’。我们乖乖的缴了枪，到处一看只有四个人，都是老百姓。”
    在江阴一带打过仗的新七旅的张某说：“共军没有到，有的地主们逃了，那晓得地主们逃屁事都没得，我还看见没逃的地主站在田边，啥事也没有，逃了的倒被我们的军队扣起来。”和记者接触过的百多个士兵，一般都知道共产党是消灭不了的。一个高梁的士兵说：“每次打共产党都没得好欺头（川语‘便宜’之意），打外战好多人还没有死，打内战死的人很多。共军缴了日本人很多枪，又缴了我们很多枪，他们打大了，枪多了，人多了，老百姓都是他们的。”他们一般都是不愿内战的，他们从芜湖一带回来，看见那里的老百姓被抽丁，想着自己过去被抽的情形，言语间表示无限同情。二十一军一个士兵说：“那情愿打仗么？人是我们死，高官是人家做。”他伸出受伤的右手举向大家说：“绝子灭孙的才愿打内战。”
