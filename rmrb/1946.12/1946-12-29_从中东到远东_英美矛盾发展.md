　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 25th: Comprehensive reports indicate that Anglo-American relations east of the Suez Canal are undergoing increasingly evident new developments.

　　On the Palestine issue, although Bevin visited Truman in the United States to discuss the matter and consulted with Byrnes multiple times, Anglo-American opinions remain far apart. Bevin stated on the 6th that if both Jewish and Arab representatives attend the Palestine conference to be held in London in January next year, the United States will also send representatives to participate. However, the spokesperson of the Arab Higher Committee stationed in London announced on the 7th that they "expressed regret" over the U.S. decision to send personnel to attend the London conference, believing that this move was detrimental to the Arabs "and endangers a reasonable solution to the Palestine issue," and declared that they would refuse to participate in the London conference. Furthermore, the Palestinian Jewish underground army, on the 19th, warned the Jewish leadership group through U.S. spokespersons that "if they continue to cooperate with the British government or accept the British partition plan, it will trigger a civil war."

　　On the Burma issue, following Attlee's announcement that he would invite Burmese leaders to Britain for negotiations in the near future, the U.S. State Department stated on the 21st that the United States also "cares" about this matter, and stated that "the United States has many friends in Burma, including those who provided great assistance to the U.S. forces stationed in Burma during the war against Japan." The implication behind the words is quite thought-provoking.

　　Regarding the entire Far East shipping industry, according to Hong Kong transportation circles on the 18th, Britain and the United States are engaging in competition centered on Hong Kong. American shipping companies are establishing offices in Hong Kong one after another, planning to increase the number of ships between the West Coast and Hong Kong, as a prelude to developing shipping to China. British shipping merchants are also preparing to unite and increase the number of merchant ships weighing over 8,000 tons traveling in Europe to the Far East and the Chinese coast, in order to demonstrate resistance.

### 从中东到远东  英美矛盾发展

　　从中东到远东
    英美矛盾发展
    【新华社延安二十五日电】综合各方报导：英美在苏伊士河以东的关系，有日益明显的新发展。
    在巴勒斯坦问题上，虽然贝文于留美时访杜鲁门商谈此事，并与贝纳斯会商多次，英美意见仍相距甚远。贝约斯曾于六日表示，倘犹太及阿拉伯代表皆出席明年一月间在伦敦举行之巴勒斯坦会议，则美国亦将派代表参加。而阿拉伯高级委员会驻伦敦发言人则于七日宣布对美国决派员列席伦敦会议“表示遗憾”，认为此举实使阿拉伯不利，“且危及巴勒斯坦问题之合理解决”，并声言将拒绝参加伦敦会议。而巴勒斯坦犹太地下军于十九日经由美方发言机关警告犹太领导集团称：“如继续与英政府合作，或接受英方的分割计划，则将引起内战”。
    在缅甸问题上，继艾德礼宣布将于短期内邀请缅甸各领袖赴英谈判之后，美国务院于二十一日声明美国亦“关心”此事，并谓“美国在缅甸有不少好友，包括在对日战争中予美驻缅军队以极大帮助之人在内”。弦外之音，颇堪玩味。
    在整个远东航业上、据香港交通界十八日息：英美正以香港为中心展开竞争。美航业正纷纷在港设办事处，拟加增其西海岸与香港之间轮船，并为发展对华航业之先声。英航商亦准备联合一致将行走欧洲一带之商轮载重超过八千吨者，增航远东及中国沿岸，以示对抗。
