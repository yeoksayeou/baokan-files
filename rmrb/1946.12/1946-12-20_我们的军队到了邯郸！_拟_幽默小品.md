　　"Our Troops Have Reached Handan!"
    A "Humorous Skit"
    ·Siji·
    It is said that Chen Cheng, the Chief of Staff of Chiang Kai-shek's army, arrived in Nanjing from Beiping (Peiping) on an American plane. Overwhelmed with mixed feelings, he went straight to the "National Government" to see "Chairman" Chiang.

    "Report!" he shouted as soon as he saw Chiang Kai-shek: "Our troops have reached Handan!"

    Chiang Kai-shek, who was then holding an American cigarette between his fingers, became tense all over when he heard the news.

    "Good!" he exclaimed, handing his Chief of Staff an American cigarette. "Well done! Have a 'Motherland Brand' cigarette! Let us celebrate the annihilation of the Communists!"

    "Yes," Chen Cheng replied, taking the cigarette, without saying another word.

    "How many of our troops have reached Handan?" Chiang Kai-shek asked anxiously.

    "Seventy thousand."

    "Good, that's quite a few. Who was the first to break in?"

    "The 3rd Division, Commander Zhao Xitian."

    "And behind him?"

    "104th Brigade Commander Liu Guangxin, 119th Brigade Commander Yang Xianming; He Guansan, the commander of the Hebei Security General Corps, also arrived."

    "Then, I believe: they must have captured a lot of things from the Communist army."

    "I heard quite a lot, they got a lot of consolation and freedom."

    "What, the people welcomed them?"

    "No, Liu Bocheng prepared it for them."

    "Damn it! What nonsense are you talking about! How did Liu Bocheng comfort them?"

    "Yes, Chairman, really." Chen Cheng lowered his head in frustration and reported at attention: "Because on their way to Handan, they all surrendered their guns."

　　“我们的军队到了邯郸！”
    拟“幽默小品”
    ·思基·
    话说蒋家的陆军参谋总长陈诚从北平乘美机到了南京。悲喜莫明，直奔“国民政府”去见蒋“主席”。
    “报告！”他一见蒋介石就叫道：“我们的军队到了邯郸！”
    蒋介石这时手指间正夹着一支美国烟在吸，听得这消息一，全身就紧张起来。
    “好呵！”他叫着随手递了一支美国烟给他的参谋总长：“有劳了！吸支“祖国牌香烟”吧！让我们庆祝共党的灭亡！”
    “是的。”陈诚接过了烟，没有说第二句话。
    “我们的军队到了邯郸多少？”蒋介石急着问。
    “七万。”
    “好的，不在少数。谁最先冲进去的？”
    “整三师，赵锡田师长。”
    “后面呢？”
    “一○四旅旅长刘广信，一一九旅旅长杨显明；河北保安总队司令何冠三也到了。”
    “那末，我相信：他们一定掳获了共军很多东西。”
    “听说不少，他们得到了很多慰问和自由的。”
    “怎么，老百姓都很欢迎他们？”
    “不，刘伯承给他们预备下的。”
    “混蛋！你说得多荒唐！刘伯承怎么慰问他们？”
    “是的，委座，实在是的。”陈诚沮丧的低着头，立正报告说：“因为他们在去到邯郸的路上，就全都把枪缴了。”
