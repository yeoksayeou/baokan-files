Hero Wang Zhongxuan, Killer of Enemies
	Lian Qun

	On October 12th, the bandit Chiang brought darkness and disaster to the people of Jiaozuo. Wang Zhongxuan's family of three also fled into the deep mountains. More than ten shi of grain at home, and the livestock that had just been bought, were all looted by Chiang's army "Homecoming Corps." Doors, windows, pots, bowls, basins, jars, and all utensils were smashed. Hatred and the flames of struggle burned in Wang Zhongxuan's heart, and he vowed to defend the fruits of the struggle and his good times. So, that night he joined the Jiaozuo Militia Guerrilla Team × Detachment.

	"Twenty-five rifles have been moved back!"

	In a secret kiln in E Lao Ci Yan, twenty-five rifles were hidden, only one or two li away from the enemy's stronghold. It was impossible to take them back without surrounding the enemy's stronghold. But Wang Zhongxuan came up with a clever plan. He first found two old people who were most familiar with the secret kiln to guide him, and took a total of five people in a commando team. One night they sneaked there and carried out twenty-five rifles. As they were carrying the guns up the mountain from the bottom of the ditch, the enemy discovered them and chased from behind. He threw a grenade behind him. The enemy couldn't figure out what was going on and didn't dare to move forward. All twenty-five rifles were moved back.

	Capture special agents and get to the bottom of it!

	On the night the enemy attacked Jiaozuo, a special agent from Dongjiaozuo Village led a child in his teens, pretending to be fleeing, trying to spy on the transfer of our troops and civilians. Wang Zhongxuan, with three or four militiamen, patrolled the mountains and stopped the spy, questioning him thoroughly. It turned out that he was a former pseudo-baozhang who had been struggled against. Once, his group infiltrated the enemy area for activities, and a female special agent said to Wang Zhongxuan: "I have been looking forward to your arrival for a long time. The Eighth Route Army holds meetings here all day long, and I can't live!" "Then come with us!" Wang Zhongxuan replied and grabbed her. It turned out that she was sent by Zhang ×× of the "Homecoming Corps" to disintegrate the militia in the mountains. In just over ten days, Wang Zhongxuan's group captured three special agents alive.

	Go wherever it's dangerous!

	In early November, when the enemy was frantically "sweeping," cadres were needed in a certain place to carry out guerrilla warfare. It was impossible to reach the destination without passing through the enemy's Seven Star Blockhouse. It was necessary to have someone escort them, but Wang Zhongxuan volunteered and went with two partners. When they passed the blockhouse, the enemy was lighting bright lights and smoking, … They put their palms in front of their feet, crawled past on all fours. This deed won a bonus of six hundred yuan from the headquarters.

	Thunder seals the blockhouse, fire burns the blockhouse!

	Wang Zhongxuan successfully escorted the cadres and discovered that the enemy was "numb." The × detachment decided to bury mines to block the Seven Star Blockhouse. Wang Zhongxuan led the combat squad, himself walking in the front, and he and his partner Ma Zhenyun and three or four others sneaked into the seventh blockhouse. Throwing stones didn't make any noise, crawling and throwing didn't make any noise. It turned out that there was no one inside, so the warriors went in. Mine sealing turned into fire attack, and the seventh blockhouse caught fire, and the sixth blockhouse also caught fire. On the second night, the enemy's fifth and fourth blockhouses also caught fire at the same time.

	One is worth five, grain is the lifeline.

	On November 15th, Wang Zhongxuan and his heroes went to Maocha to seize grain and encountered the enemy. Only dozens of steps away from the enemy, he automatically took four militiamen and first occupied the high ground with machine guns, repelling more than twenty enemies, chasing the enemy all the way to Xuhe. When they came out, everyone's bags were filled with grain.

	One shot kills one enemy.

	The "Homecoming Corps" was not convinced after being chased last time. On November 18th, they increased their strength to more than seventy people and came to Maocha to retaliate and grab grain. Wang Zhongxuan and his warriors, under the command of District Cadre Ren as the captain, had already ambushed in the area to wait. When the enemy entered the narrow ditch, a volley of shots rang out. The enemy desperately fought for the high ground. Wang Zhongxuan calmly sniped at the enemy, fired a shot, and an enemy on the hillside rolled down. He encouraged them and said: "I killed one with one shot. Aim carefully and shoot well." They used all their strength to block the enemy. After a fierce battle for more than an hour, the enemy was routed. Two enemy corpses were abandoned on the road, and seven or eight were wounded. The enemy's conspiracy to grab grain was crushed.

	On November 21st, at the Jiaozuo City-Wide Enemy-Killing Hero Election Conference, Comrade Wang Zhongxuan was elected as the "City's Top Enemy-Killing Hero."

　　杀敌英雄王仲轩
    联群
    十月十二日蒋贼给焦作人民带来了黑暗和灾难，王仲轩家里的三口人也逃到深山里了。家里的十余石粮食，和刚买回的牲口，都被蒋军“还乡团”抢光了。门窗、锅碗、盆罐、水缸，一切用具被捣碎了。王仲轩内心燃烧起仇恨与斗争的烈火，立誓保卫斗争果实，保卫自己的好时光。于是就在这天晚上他参加了焦作民兵武工队×支队。
    “二十五枝步枪搬回来了！”
    在峨老词严的一个秘密窑洞里，藏着廿五枝步枪，距敌人据点仅一、二里远，不包围敌人的据点是不能拿回的。可是王仲轩想出一个巧计，他先找到最熟习那个秘密窑洞的两个老百姓作引导，带着一共五人组成的突击小组，在一个晚间偷偷摸到那里，扛出二十五枝步枪。当他们正从沟底扛着枪往山上爬时，敌人发觉，从后边追上来了，他往后扔了一棵手榴弹，敌人摸不清是干啥的，不敢前进了，二十五枝步枪都搬回来了。
    活捉特务追根到底！
    敌人进攻焦作那天晚上，东焦作村的一个特务，引着十几岁的一个小孩，假装逃难，企图刺探我军民转移情况。王仲轩带着三四个民兵在山上游动，把这个探子挡住了，追问到底，原来是被斗争过的伪保长。有一次，他的小组楔入敌区活动，一个女特务向王仲轩说：“早就盼你们来，八路军在这里成天开会，俺不能活”！“那么跟我们走吧”！王仲轩回答后就扭住了她。原来她是“还乡团”张××派出来，准备到山里瓦解民兵。短短十几天内，王仲轩小组就活捉了三名特务。
    那里危险就到那里去！
    十一月初，敌人疯狂“扫荡”时，某地需要干部去开展游击战争。非经过敌人的七星炮楼，不能到达目的地，必需要人护送，王仲轩却自动报名，带领两个伙伴就去了。他们经过炮楼时，敌人正点着明闪闪的灯，吸着烟，……他们把手掌当前足，四肢着地，爬过去了。这事迹曾获得指挥部的六百元奖金。
    雷封炮楼，火烧炮楼！
    王仲轩护送干部成功，发觉敌人“麻木”，×支队就定计去埋雷封锁七星炮楼。王仲轩率领战斗班，自己走最前边，和他的伙伴马镇云三四人，摸到第七号炮楼。丢石头没动静，爬爬丢丢，也没动静，原来里边没有人，于是勇士们进去了。雷封变成火攻，第七号炮楼起了火，第六号炮楼也起了火。第二晚上敌人的第五号、第四号炮楼也同时起火了。
    一个顶五个，粮食是命根。
    十一月十五日，王仲轩和他的英雄们去猫岔抢运粮食，与敌发生遭遇。离敌人仅数十步，他自动带着四个民兵，先用机枪占了高地，打退敌人二十余名，直把敌人追到许河。出来，每人布袋里灌满了粮食。
    一枪打死一个敌人。
    “还乡团”在上次挨了追击以后，不服气。在十一月十八日，加大兵力到七十余人，到猫岔来报复、抢粮。王仲轩和他的勇士，在区干部任队长指挥下，早就预伏该地等候。当敌人进到狭小的沟底时，一排子枪响起来了，敌人拚命争夺高地，王仲轩沉着的阻击敌人，放了一枪，半坡上的敌人，滚下去了一个。他鼓动着说：“我一枪打死一个。好好瞄准打”，他们用尽一切力量阻击敌人，激战一个多钟头，敌人溃退了。路上遗弃敌尸两具，伤七八名。敌人的抢粮阴谋被粉碎了。
    十一月二十一日，焦作全市杀敌英雄选举大会上，王仲轩同志被选为“全市头等杀敌英雄”。
