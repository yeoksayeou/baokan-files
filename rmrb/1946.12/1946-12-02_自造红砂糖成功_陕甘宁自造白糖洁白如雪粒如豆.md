　　Successful Self-Made Brown Sugar
    Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Self-Made White Sugar is as White as Snow and the Grains are Like Beans
    [This Newspaper] The Zhenxing Farm in Nanxinzhuang, Handan City, planted ten mu of sugar beets this year. More than a dozen cadres and workers, with the assistance of the Handan District Government, have already started boiling sugar in a certain village. They can produce 70-80 catties of sugar per day, and it is estimated that they can produce 2,000 catties. The brown sugar has a pure taste and excellent quality. However, since it is the first time it has been boiled, the color is lighter and the sand grains are small. If it is left for two or three months after being taken out of the pot, the color will gradually turn black, which is no different from the brown sugar on the market. (Liu Xiaolin)
    [Another Dispatch] The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has been making beet brown sugar for two or three years. Recently, Comrade Lin Zhong of the Industrial Bureau, based on past experience, successfully trial-produced white sugar using simple tools. The sugar is as clean as snow, the grains are like beans, and the taste is fresh and sweet, its quality is similar to Taikoo Sugar. There are three steps in making this sugar: 1. Neutralize the acidity of the beet sugar liquid with lime and coagulate its protein; 2. Precipitate excess lime and decompose sugar-calcium salts in the sugar juice by passing carbon dioxide gas; 3. By passing sulfur dioxide, not only does it have the effect of whitening the sugar juice, but also the lime in the sugar juice is chemically synthesized into calcium sulfite and analyzes the lime in the sugar juice, which can be reduced to 15 in 10,000. Then evaporate to concentrate and crystallize, and separate the molasses, which becomes beet white sugar like cane sugar. This year, more than 20 mu of sugar beets were planted near Yan'an, which can produce more than 30,000 catties of sugar, which can reduce the difficulty of the Kuomintang's sugar blockade.

　　自造红砂糖成功
    陕甘宁自造白糖洁白如雪粒如豆
    【本报讯】邯郸市南辛庄振兴农场，今年积糖萝卜十亩，现在有干部及工人十余人在邯郸区政府协助之下，业已在某村开始熬糖。日可产糖七、八十斤，据目下估计可能产二千斤。该红砂糖味道纯正，品质优良。唯系初次熬出，颜色较淡，砂粒细小。若在出锅二、三月后，颜色渐黑，即与市面上之红砂糖无异。（柳小林）
    【又讯】陕甘宁边区制萝卜红糖已二三年，最近工业局林中同志根据过去经验，用简陋工具试造白糖成功。糖洁净如雪，颗粒如豆，味道鲜甜，其质近似太古糖。制此糖有三个步骤：一、把萝卜糖液加石灰中和其酸性后，凝结其蛋白质等；二、通过二氧化炭气沉淀多余石灰质和分解糖汁中之糖钙盐。三、通二氧化硫，不特有洁白糖汁之作用，且将糖汁中之石灰化合成亚硫酸钙而分析出糖汁中之石灰质，可减至万分之十五，然后蒸发浓结晶，将糖蜜分出，即成与蔗糖一样之萝卜白糖。今年延安附近种糖萝卜二十多亩可制糖三万余斤，可减少国民党封锁糖之困难。
