    Masses Closely Monitor, Track, and Pursue
    Daming Smashes Chiang's "Underground Army"
    "Regimental Commander" and Others All Captured, Riot Plot Completely Crushed
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 11th Dispatch] Daming County's peasant emancipation movement is closely combined with anti-espionage work, and a thorough anti-espionage struggle has been launched to combat the offensive of Chiang's troops. In the fifth district, the masses of Shanle Camp and Huangzhuang closely monitored the activities of Chiang's special agents "Battalion Commander" Yang Guotang and Ren Kecheng at the beginning of the struggle. Based on the specific facts of their rumors and sabotage, they conducted a root-tracing struggle. As a result, the two special agents could not hide and confessed to the "underground army" (numbered "Youth Volunteer Corps") of more than 70 people hidden in the county. This special agent organization has been secretly active since February last year. This year, in the mass movement, in order to control village power, they adopted deceptive methods such as threats, inducements, and bribery, and deceived a large number of our village cadres and basic masses, which hindered the land reform movement. Their main task was to hide in Daming for a long time to assassinate, destroy mass organizations, and prepare to riot at the end of the lunar October to cooperate with Chiang's army going north, attempting to cooperate from the inside and outside to seize Daming, first targeting village cadres, and then solving our county and district cadres, in order to "wipe them out in one fell swoop." This made the masses more deeply aware of Chiang Kai-shek's vicious special agent policy, causing extreme hatred. They immediately arrested more than 20 people, including the confessed Chiang's special agent regimental commander Zhao Linfu, deputy regimental commander Zhang Ziquan, secretary Zhao Fuping, quartermaster Chang Yongtu, and company commander Yang Yaotang, and convened a joint public trial of the masses in nearby villages. According to the degree of confession of the special agents, four people were released on the spot. The special agent ringleaders who did not confess were unanimously demanded by the masses to continue to be detained for interrogation. Influenced by the government's lenient policy, many deceived special agents have voluntarily surrendered to the masses and signed guarantees. After this anti-espionage struggle, the masses of the county attached great importance to anti-espionage work. Now the masses in the county are actively preparing for war. They said with confidence: "If the enemy dares to attack Daming, we will let him die in Daming."

    群众严密监视跟踪追寻
    大名破获蒋“地下军”
    “团长”等无一漏网暴动阴谋全粉碎
    【本报威县十一日电】大名县农民翻身运动与反特工作密切结合，展开了深入的反特斗争，以打击蒋军的进攻。五区善乐营和黄庄的群众，在斗争开始时，就密切注意了蒋特“营长”杨国堂、任克诚的活动，根据其造谣破坏的具体事实，进行了追根斗争，结果两特务无法隐瞒，供出隐蔽在该县的“地下军”（番号为“青年义勇团”）七十余人。该特务组织自去年二月开始秘密活动，今年在群运中，为了掌握村政权，采取了威胁、利诱、收买等欺骗方式，大量诱骗我村干部和基本群众，使土地改革运动受到阻碍。他们主要任务是长期在大名隐蔽暗杀，破坏群众组织，准备在旧历十月底暴动，配合蒋军北上，企图里应外合，侵占大名，先搞村干部，继续解决我县区干部，以便“一网打尽”。由此群众更深刻的认识了蒋介石毒辣的特务政策，引起万分痛恨，马上将供出的蒋特团长赵林甫、团副张子荃、书记赵甫平、军需常永图、连长杨耀堂等二十余人逮捕，并召集附近各村群众联合公审。根据特务坦白程度，当场释放四名，不坦白的特务头子，群众一致要求继续扣押审讯。被骗特务在政府宽大政策影响下，已有多名自动向群众自首具结。群众经这次反特斗争，对反特工作极为重视。现该县群众正积极进行战争准备，他们有信心的说：“敌人敢来进攻大名，就叫他死在大名。”
