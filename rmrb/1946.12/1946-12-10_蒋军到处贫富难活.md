　　【AnYang News from this Newspaper】 Since the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army's bestial hooves trampled into the liberated areas of Anyang, they have imposed exorbitant taxes and levies, making life unbearable for everyone, and people are constantly complaining. For example, in Donghuiying in the Fourth District, which has less than 200 households, according to escaping masses, the village was once assigned six machine guns (priced at 1 million legal tender per gun), more than 60 rifles (350,000 per rifle), and 15,000 rounds of ammunition, and a grain and money levy of 36 million legal tender. Most of these levies were imposed on the middle and lower-middle peasants. Apart from a few local bullies and special agent landlords, even the average small and medium landlords could not escape. In the past, landlords who were deceived or did not understand our policies fled to Zhangde and Tangyin. This time, when they returned with the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army, they were immediately assigned "return-to-village ammunition fees" as soon as they arrived. The masses in villages such as Xiayao in the Sixth District have all moved out, leaving only a few landlords. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet army demands grain and money from them every day. The landlords cry and complain, unable to cope. Once, because they could not satisfy the Chiang army's extortion, a landlord made an excuse to go out, fired a few shots outside the village, and went back to tell the Chiang army: "The Eighth Route Army has attacked!" The Chiang army soldiers who were urging the payment of grain and money believed it and ran away. Therefore, although the Chiang army has occupied the area for a long time, it cannot establish its regime. (Shi Hong)
    【News from this Newspaper】 After the Chiang army invaded Jiaozuo, the old village chiefs of the past returned to Jiaozuo along with the Chiang army. Traitorous secret agent leaders stood over the people and carried out ruthless oppression, beating, scolding, smashing pots and bowls everywhere, and demanding that the people hand over the fruits of their recent recovery. Their vicious methods are even worse than during the Japanese occupation. They levy grain and money every day. A farmer in Xiabai only redeemed three mu of land this year and harvested one stone and two dou of autumn grain, but was assigned 9,000 legal tender in one go. If this is levied again, he will be ruined. The Chiang army builds bunkers wherever it goes. In Yanhe Village, more than a dozen blockhouses were built at once. In Xifengfeng, 320 civilians were sent to Qinghua to repair the city walls, and they have not returned for nine days. Now the masses are constantly chanting: "Eighth Route Army, please come quickly!"

　　蒋军到处贫富难活
    【本报安阳讯】蒋伪军兽蹄踏进安阳解放区后，横征暴敛，人人难活，叫苦连天。如四区东灰营不到二百户，据逃出群众谈，一次便派给该村机枪六挺（每挺作价法币百万元），步枪六十余支（每枝三十五万），子弹一万五千发，并派粮款三千六百万元。这些款，大部派给中农以下的群众身上，大户除少数恶霸和特务地主，一般中小地主亦不能逃脱。过去被骗和不了解我之政策逃到彰德、汤阴，这次随蒋伪军返回的地主，刚一登门，便派来“还乡弹药费”。六区夏窑等村群众都转移出来，只留下少数地主，蒋伪军每天逼着要粮要款，地主哭叫诉苦，无法应付。一次，因无法满足蒋军的勒索，一地主便借故外出，在村外打了几枪，回去给蒋军说：“八路军打进来了！”该催粮款之蒋军信以为真，拔腿逃走。因此，目前蒋军虽已侵占好久，但政权无法建立。（史洪）
    【本报讯】蒋军侵占焦作后，以前的旧保长又随着蒋军回到了焦作，汉奸特务头子又站在人民头上无法无天的进行压榨，到处打骂摔锅打碗，要老百姓交出刚收回的果实，其毒辣手段比日寇统治时期有增无减。成天派粮要款，下白作一农民今年才赎回三亩地，收了一石二斗秋，一次就派他九千元，这样再派一次就干了。蒋军每到一处就大修碉堡，在阎河村一次就修了十几个炮楼。西冯封一次被派往清化修城墙的民夫，就有三百二十人一去九天没回来。现在群众整天默念着：“八路军快来吧！”
