[Report from Taiyue on the 13th by this Newspaper] "Avenge Grievances Immediately," this is the slogan and action of 50,000 liberated peasants in the occupied areas of Linfen in the struggle against the reversal of land reform. This movement is reaching its climax, the masses' armed forces are constantly strengthening, and the "land reform reversal mediation committees" are collapsing one after another. After Hu Zongnan occupied Linfen, he immediately organized "Revenge Squads" and "Land Reform Reversal Squads," and even more insidiously organized land reform reversal "Mediation Committees." Under the deceptive slogans of "those without land to till should return rented land, and those with land to till should return the land," countless fruits of struggle of the liberated peasants were not only robbed back, but even their original possessions were taken. A liberated small furnace worker in Chenghuang Village, in addition to returning all the land, houses, and grain he had obtained, even his original family property was robbed, and he returned empty-handed to his original home in Jincheng. At that time, the land reform reversal elements were extremely rampant. For example, Wang Huamin, Wu Zhendong, and Qiao Weilong, land reform reversal elements in Qiaoli Town, persecuted liberated peasants in every possible way, and the fruits of land reform reversal were even recovered with interest. The wife of the local tyrant Zhang Kejian in Xibotou led the revenge squad to "avenge revenge" against the chairman of the village peasant association and the director of the military committee. For a time, the liberated peasants fled in all directions, and no one harvested the crops in the fields. However, soon the leadership seized the opportunity during the war to lead the liberated peasants in the struggle against land reform reversal. In the struggle, the masses created the loud slogan against land reform reversal: "Avenge Grievances Immediately." The cadres and militiamen of Beijiao Village temporarily retreated to the mountains during the Kuomintang army's rampant offensive, but when they heard that their liberated comrades were being bullied by the reactionaries, they immediately fought back to their hometown, killing several of the worst heads of the "mediation committees" with broadswords. Militiamen from the fourth district broke into the Kuomintang army's heavily guarded grid network at night, and the Xibo Village captured Zhang Kejian's wife from the "Revenge Squad" alive. Jing Mingsan, a liberated peasant in Chenghuang Village, secretly organized the masses of the entire village to destroy the "Mediation Committee" headed by reactionary landlords such as Jing Tiancong, Jing Xiwen, and Jing Daosan, and regained the fruits of the land reform reversal that had been taken from the peasants. The peasants and militiamen of Shangguan Village constantly tracked down and pursued the "Revenge Squad," and twice captured Xie Paisheng, who had betrayed the people and surrendered to the enemy, finally beating the traitor to death in public. The "Mediation Committee" in Shangxia Guan Village retreated from then on. Local armed forces and the Public Security Bureau also cooperated day and night in the struggle against land reform reversal, supporting the masses. The county security team cooperated with the militia to kill the head of the land reform reversal in Qiaoli Town, scaring away Wang Huashui of the "Mediation Committee." As a result, Qiao Weilong returned all the property of the peasants who had been subjected to land reform reversal and apologized to the liberated peasants: "It is reasonable for you to settle accounts with me, and now I will return everything to you in its original state." And some of the "little land reform reversal team members" who followed the lead pleaded with the peasants, willing to beg for protection to abandon their evil ways and return to the right path. At present, the mass movement against land reform reversal in Linfen has reached its climax. The peasants have become more armed, strong, and firm in the struggle against land reform reversal. The militia in the third district has increased both in numbers and equipment in the struggle against land reform reversal. The Kuomintang army in Donghedi covered the "Land Reform Reversal Squad" in several raids on Shangcun, but they were all repelled by the militia, and the Kuomintang army's special agent activities were suppressed. The masses in Linfen have created a set of methods for dealing with the "Land Reform Reversal Squad" in the struggle against land reform reversal: 1. Those who fled in fear of punishment during the mass movement this spring and joined the "Revenge Squad" and other organizations, leading the enemy to rob the masses of their fruits and killing peasant association cadres and the masses, should be immediately avenged, arrested on the spot, and executed to eliminate harm to the people. 2. Those who rely on the enemy's power to only rob the masses of their fruits should be arrested and handed over to the masses to be dealt with according to the severity of their crimes. 3. Those who secretly spread rumors to intimidate the masses into giving up their fruits should be educated to repent and return the fruits to the masses. As a result, many of the accomplices of the "Mediation Committee" have changed their minds and turned back, and the "Mediation Committees" have collapsed one after another.
[Report from Xingtai by this Newspaper] This county discovered that stubborn landlords kept "accounts for changing times," attempting to reverse the land reform in the future. After the thorough land reform movement in Hui Village, the fourth district of this county, the land problem has been completely resolved, and most of the landlords have also begun to transform under the education of the masses, preparing to support themselves or engage in industry and commerce, but some stubborn landlords still oppose the masses in their hearts, even if they appear to bow to them on the surface. For example, at the end of last month, the masses found an "account for changing times" in the cellar of a landlord, which recorded: "On × year × month × day, who struggled against him, who took away his land, etc." They are preparing to have the Chiang bandits come over and double the reversal of the land reform for the masses. This has aroused close attention from the local masses. (Li Yiben)

　　武装起来现仇现报
    临汾普遍打退倒算
    农民力量不断增长恶霸自动退回物资
    打入敌人格子网
    活捉地主复仇队
    胁从分子不断悔过
    “调解会”纷纷垮台
    【本报太岳十三日电】“现仇现报”，这是临汾被占区五万翻身农民反倒算斗争的口号与行动，现这一运动正达高潮，群众武装不断增强，“倒算调解会”纷纷垮台。胡宗南占据临汾以后，立刻组织“复仇队”“倒算队”，更组织阴谋毒辣的倒算“调解会”，在“没地种翻出租种地，有地种者退回土地”等欺骗口号下，无数翻身农民的斗争果实不但被劫夺回去，连原有的家当也贴上。城隍村一翻身小炉匠，除将所得土地、房屋、粮食全部退还外，连自己原有的一份家产也被劫夺去，两手空空的返回原籍晋城。当时倒算分子极猖狂，如乔李镇的倒算分子王化民、吴振东、乔维龙等，百般陷害翻身农民，倒算果实更采用加利的办法。西堡头恶霸张克俭之妻，带领复仇队向村农会主席武委会主任“倒复仇”，一时翻身农民四出逃乱，地里庄稼无人收割。但不久领导上抓住战争空隙，领导翻身农民反倒算斗争，在斗争中群众创造了响亮的反倒算口号“现仇现报”。北郊村干部与民兵在蒋军猖狂进攻中，曾暂时退往山上，但听到翻身的伙伴被反动派欺压时，马上打回老家去，劈刀杀了几个最坏的“调解会”头子，四区民兵夜间打进蒋军重重的格子网内，西堡村活捉“复仇队”张克俭之妻。城隍村翻身农民景明三，暗地里组织全村群众，摧毁了以景田聪、景希文、景道三等反动地主为首的“调解会”，夺回农民被倒算的果实。上官村农民与民兵时时跟踪追击“复仇队”，两次捉拿投敌害民的谢排盛，终将该逆当众打死，上下官村“调解会”就此退却。地方武装与公安局亦日夜配合反倒算斗争出击，给群众撑腰。县保安队与民兵配合曾打死乔李镇的倒算头子，吓退“调解会”之王化水，于是乔维龙便将倒算农民的一切财产全部送还，并向翻身农民赔罪：“你们向我算帐是合理的，现在原盘归还你们”。而有些随从“小倒算队员”，则向农民哀告，愿讨保改邪归正。目前临汾群众反倒算运动已达高潮，农民从反倒算斗争中武装更加强大坚强，三区民兵在反倒算中人枪俱增，东河底蒋军掩护“倒算队”数次奔袭上村，均被民兵击退，并镇压了蒋军的特务活动。临汾群众在反倒算斗争中创造了一套对待“倒算队”的办法：一、今春群运中畏罪逃亡，而参加“复仇队”及其他团体，带领敌人向群众劫取果实，杀害农会干部与群众者，现仇现报，就地逮捕处决，以除民害。二、仗依敌人势力仅劫取群众果实者，逮捕后交群众以罪恶轻重处理。三、暗地造谣恐吓群众退出果实者，则教育其向群众自新悔过，退还群众果实，于是“调解会”的胁从分子，多已转意回头，“调解会”纷纷垮台。
    【本报邢台讯】本县发现顽固地主留“变天帐”，企图将来倒算。该县四区会＠村经过翻身大运动之后，土地问题已彻底解决，大部分地主也在群众教育中开始转变，准备自食其力或经营工商业，但部分顽固地主，则表面向群众低头，内心仍与群众为敌。如上月底群众从某地主地窖内找出“变天”帐一本，上面记着：“×年×月×日，谁斗争他，谁算去了他的土地等等。准备蒋贼过来，加倍向群众倒算。已引起当地群众的密切注意。（李一本）
