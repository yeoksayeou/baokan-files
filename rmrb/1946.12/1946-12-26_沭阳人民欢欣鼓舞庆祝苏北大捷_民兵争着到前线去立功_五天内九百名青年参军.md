Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 23rd: The people of Shuyang are cheerfully celebrating the great victory on the northern front. The entire city’s streets and walls are covered with large-character victory reports, attracting everyone's attention; even seventy and eighty-year-old gentlemen are putting on their reading glasses to read them eagerly. After hearing the news of the victory, all the militiamen in the city are itching to get to the front lines to earn merits. On the 19th alone, a hundred militiamen rushed to the front lines to cooperate with the main forces in combat. An old man with a long beard, Wang Xuzhang, also requested to go to the front lines, but the squad leader refused him. He was not convinced. He said, "Huang Zhong didn't accept being old at eighty-three, am I not good enough?" The women of the city are actively completing the task of comforting the army. Huainan Town completed 180 pairs of military shoes in four days. Now, the city's comfort groups are actively arranging Yangko dances and preparing to celebrate the great victory on the front lines and welcome the victory of the counter-offensive year – New Year's Day of 1947.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 23rd: In order to defend their fields and drive out the invaders, 900 young people in Shuyang County enthusiastically joined the army in five days (from the 5th to the 10th). Overturned peasant Pan Weihuai declined the matchmaker who was arranging a marriage for him, saying: "I want to join the army. It won't be too late to get engaged after I drive away the reactionaries." Jiang Ying, the chairman of the Women's Federation of Zhouji Township, personally sent her fiancé to the district office to sign up for the army, and the two agreed: "One will fight heroically on the front lines, and the other will work diligently as a model in the rear." Since the beginning of the self-defense war, more than 4,600 young people in Shuyang have joined the army, of which 2,646 have joined the main force.

    【新华社华中二十三日电】沭阳人民欢欣鼓舞，庆祝北线大捷。全城街巷墙壁上遍贴斗大字体的捷报，吸引着每个人的注意；七八十岁的老先生也戴上老光镜争相阅读。全城民兵听到胜利消息后，个个磨拳擦掌，争着到前线去立功。十九日一天中，即有百名民兵奔赴前线，配合主力作战。一个蓄有长须的王叙章老汉也要求上前线，中队长不要他去，他不服气。他说：“黄忠八十三岁不服老像，我这样就不中吗？”该城妇女积极完成劳军任务，淮南镇四天内完成军鞋一百八十双，现全城各地宣慰团正积极编排花鼓秧歌，准备庆祝前线大捷与迎接反攻胜利年——一九四七年的元旦。
    【新华社华中廿三日电】为保卫田地驱逐进犯者，沭阳县五天（五日至十日）内，有九百名青年踊跃参军。翻身农民潘维怀谢绝为他说亲的媒人说：“我要去参军呢，打走反动派回来定亲也不迟。”周集乡妇联会长姜英亲自到婆家送未婚夫到区署报名参军，两人相约：“一个在前线参战作英雄，一个在后方勤务作模范。”自自卫战开始以来，沭阳青年参军者达四千六百余名，其中参加主力军的即有二千六百四十六名。
