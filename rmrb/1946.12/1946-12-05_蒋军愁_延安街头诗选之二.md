　　Jiang Army's Sorrow
  　Selected Poems from Yan'an Streets, Part Two
    Gao Minfu
    Coming running, leaving crawling,
    Missing a leg, short an arm!
    Coming smiling, leaving crying,
    Wearing long gowns, sleeves cut short!
    Coming worried, leaving annoyed,
    Cursing Yellow Mountain, blaming the stones!
    Coming hungry, leaving thirsty,
    Resenting the groves, hating the gullies!
    Coming by truck, leaving by stretcher,
    Short-lived ghosts, not long for this world,
    If not dead, then prisoners!

　　蒋军愁
  　延安街头诗选之二
    高敏夫
    跑着来，爬着走，
    缺了腿，短了手！
    笑着来，哭着走，
    披长衣，挂短袖！
    愁着来，恼着走，
    咒黄山，怪石头！
    饿着来，渴着走，
    怨梢林，恨山沟！
    车上来，担架走，
    短命鬼，不长寿，
    要不死，当俘虏！
