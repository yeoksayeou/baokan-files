Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 13th: General Zhou Enlai delivered a speech yesterday at the "Double Twelfth" Tenth Anniversary Conference. The full text is as follows:

Comrades, Gentlemen:

The "Double Twelfth" Incident has passed a full ten years. China has shifted from civil war to the War of Resistance Against Japan, and now has unfortunately returned to civil war. This is a historical lesson worth studying.

Regardless of the current return to civil war, China has experienced the eight-year stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Japanese fascism was defeated, the people's armed forces that resisted Japan grew stronger, and an area with a population of 144 million under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has achieved true liberation. There, the people practice democracy, the peasants obtain land, and the people of the whole country, under this inspiration, also recognize that a powerful imperialism can be defeated. This is the historical gain of the "Double Twelfth" Incident.

The significance of the "Double Twelfth" Incident itself lies in it becoming a historical turning point for stopping the civil war and launching the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the September 18th Incident, the people gradually became dissatisfied with the Kuomintang authorities' policy of non-resistance against Japan. Especially after the Chinese Communist Party led the people's armed forces north to resist Japan and called on the whole country to establish a national united front against Japan, the call of the people of the whole country to stop the civil war and implement the War of Resistance Against Japan became more widespread and influenced the "Communist Suppression Army" at that time, first influencing the Northeast Army and the Seventeenth Route Army on the front lines of the civil war. After the "December 9th" student movement, the national salvation movement, and the imprisonment of the Seven Gentlemen, especially after the Chinese People's Red Army completed the 25,000-li Long March and turned east to cross the Yellow River to resist Japan, the national anti-Japanese upsurge was bound to move towards the War of Resistance. This was the general trend and the desire of the people, which was unstoppable. However, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek had other intentions and insisted on refusing the Northeast Army's request to fight against Japan when the Japanese invaders attacked Suiyuan, forcing Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng to continue the civil war. However, this perverse act of his not only failed to achieve his goal, but also triggered the Xi'an Incident, and he himself was thus forced to reluctantly resist Japan. History should judge fairly that the Xi'an Incident was forced by Chiang Kai-shek himself, and Chiang Kai-shek's resistance against Japan was forced by Generals Zhang and Yang in accordance with the public will of the people. It is no coincidence that Generals Zhang and Yang have since gained the understanding and support of the people. Now that it has been more than a year since the victory of the War of Resistance, Generals Zhang and Yang have been imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek for ten years. The people will rise up to give a fair judgment on this case, and only the people will truly insist on the release of Zhang and Yang. Those adults, gentlemen, and ladies who guaranteed that Zhang and Yang would be safe have long been ungrateful and broken their promises. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the "Double Twelfth," we demand the immediate release of Generals Zhang and Yang. They have contributed to the cause of the War of Resistance.

Chiang Kai-shek's resistance against Japan was forced and reluctant. Therefore, throughout the entire process of the War of Resistance, there existed a struggle between two lines: one was the line of resistance, unity, and democracy; the other was the line of compromise, division, and dictatorship. The former was upheld by the CCP and received the support of the people. The latter was upheld by Chiang Kai-shek and received the applause of enemy puppets and reactionaries. The CCP and the people advocated active resistance and insisted on victory, while Chiang Kai-shek, in the early stage of the War of Resistance, united with Germany and Italy in an attempt to compromise; in the later stage of the War of Resistance, he colluded with enemy puppets and passively resisted Japan. The CCP and the people advocated uniting all anti-Japanese forces in order to defeat the Japanese invaders, while Chiang Kai-shek divided the anti-Japanese front and used the War of Resistance to continuously weaken and even eliminate non-direct line troops. First, it was the Northeast Army and the Seventeenth Route Army, and he did not hesitate to wage civil war against the anti-Japanese troops led by the CCP. The CCP and the people advocated implementing democracy in order to mobilize all the forces of the people and persist in the War of Resistance. Chiang Kai-shek, however, vigorously practiced dictatorship, oppressed the people, and made the War of Resistance powerless. Under such circumstances, if it were not for the efforts of the CCP behind enemy lines and the persistence of the people throughout the country, China's War of Resistance would have been ruined by Chiang Kai-shek long ago. Therefore, as soon as the Japanese invaders surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek used Japanese prisoners of war, incorporated puppet troops, and carried out a larger-scale anti-communist and anti-people civil war.

In January of this year, amidst the national people's yearning for peace and democracy, Chiang Kai-shek was again forced to reluctantly accept the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). However, they were soon overturned, either openly or secretly, by the Nanjing February Military Reorganization Conference and the Chongqing March Second Plenary Session, which he directed. When the fighting broke out in Northeast China and within the Great Wall, it further proved that his acceptance of the PCC resolutions and the ceasefire agreement was by no means willing. However, in the recent five months of the development of the civil war, the occupation of so many places in our liberated areas, and the current convening of an illegal, divisive "National Assembly" monopolized by one party, all his deceptive tricks have been exposed without reservation.

Judging from the situation in this year, the struggle between Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese people continues along the two lines before and after the Xi'an Incident. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the CCP and the people advocated realizing peace, democracy, and independence in accordance with the PCC line, resolutely supported the January ceasefire order, advocated the orderly implementation of the PCC resolutions, opposed American imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs, and demanded the withdrawal of American troops stationed in China and the cessation of aid to Chiang's civil war. Chiang Kai-shek, however, did not hesitate to destroy the PCC line and resolutely embarked on the road of civil war, dictatorship, and national betrayal. He attempted to eliminate the liberated areas by force, to legalize his dictatorship in the form of a "constitution," and to sell out national interests with the nation-destroying "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" in exchange for more assistance from American imperialism to carry out the civil war. However, this attempt of his will inevitably encounter the same tragic failure as when he waged the civil war ten years ago.

The current general trend and the will of the people are for peace, democracy, and independence. American imperialism's attempt to dominate the world and enslave the people will lead itself to popular disaffection. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to dominate China and enslave the people will also lead himself to popular disaffection. Chiang Kai-shek wants to follow American imperialism in search of a way out, but the result will inevitably lead to a precipice. Only the PCC line is the broad road. The century of the people has arrived, and a new high tide of democracy in China is inevitable. The persistence and victory of the people's self-defense war in the liberated areas, the development of patriotic and democratic movements in the reactionary-controlled areas, and the progress of the people of all countries will promote the arrival of this new high tide. The development of history will warn the reactionary rulers whether they want to go all the way to the dead end of civil war, dictatorship, and national betrayal.

At present, Chiang Kai-shek is still talking about a "political solution." However, most people already know that this is a deception or a "peace offensive." To distinguish the authenticity of this "political solution," we only ask him to immediately dissolve the illegal, divisive "National Assembly" monopolized by one party that is currently in session, and recognize the restoration of the positions of both armies as stipulated in the January ceasefire order. Then, the KMT-CPC negotiations can be reopened. If Chiang Kai-shek is willing to do this, then there is a possibility of returning to the PCC line. Otherwise, the Chinese people will see more clearly that Chiang Kai-shek's real goal is to "eliminate the liberated areas by force," and that the "political solution" is just his deceptive slogan.

We believe that after ten years of experience and lessons since the Xi'an Incident, the Chinese people will never be fooled again.

　　延安“双十二”十周年纪念会上
    周恩来同志演说全文
    经过十年经验教训中国人民不再上当
    蒋美反动派仍倒行逆施必致众叛亲离
    【新华社延安十三日电】周恩来将军昨日在“双十二”十周年大会上发表演说，全文如下：
    诸位先生诸位同志：
    “双十二”事变过了整整十年了，中国从内战转入抗战，现在又不幸的回到内战，这是值得大家研究的一段历史教训。
    不管现在又回到内战，中国总经历了八年的抗日战争阶段。日本法西斯被打倒了，抗日的人民军队强大起来了，一万万四千万人口的地区在中国共产党领导之下得到了真正解放。在那里人民实行民主，农民获得土地，而全中国人民在这种鼓舞之下，亦认识了一个强大的帝国主义是可以被打倒的，这就是“双十二”事变的历史收获。
    “双十二”事变本身的意义，是在它成为当时停止内战发动抗战的一个历史上的转变关键。九一八事变以后，人民已日渐不满于国民党当局的对日不抵抗政策，尤其在中国共产党领导人民武装北上抗日与号召全国建立抗日民族统一战线之后，全国人民要求停止内战，实行抗日的呼声更因之日益广泛，并影响到当时的“剿共军队”，首先影响到在内战前线的东北军与十七路军，经过“一二九”学生运动，全国救亡运动七君子之狱，尤其是中国人民红军完成二万五千里长征，转向东渡黄河抗日，全国抗日高潮必然要走向抗战，大势所趋，人心所向，这已无可阻止。唯独蒋介石先生却别具心肠，硬要在日寇进攻绥东之时，拒绝东北军请缨抗日，强迫张学良、杨虎城两将军继续进行内战。但他这种倒行逆施不仅未能达到目的，反而激起了西安事变，而他自己也因此一逼才勉强抗日。历史应该公断西安事变是蒋介石自己逼成的，蒋介石抗战是张杨两将军顺应人民公意逼成的。张杨两将军从此就获得人民的谅解与拥护不是偶然的。现在抗战已经胜利一年多了，然而张杨两将军却被蒋介石幽囚了十年，这段公案，人民会起来给以正当裁判，也只有人民才会真正坚持释放张杨。那些担保张杨无事的大人先生和太太们，却早已忘恩负义食言而肥。在纪念“双十二”十周年的今天，我们要求立即释放张杨两将军，他们是有功于抗战事业的。
    蒋介石的抗战既是被逼的勉强的，所以在抗战的全部过程中却存在着两条路线的斗争：一条是抗战团结民主的路线；一条是妥协分裂独裁的路线。前者为中共所坚持，得到人民的拥护。而后者则为蒋介石所坚持，得到敌伪与反动分子的喝彩。中共及人民是主张积极抗战坚持胜利的，而蒋介石抗战初期，则联合德、意企图妥协；在抗战后期，则勾结敌伪，消极抗战。中共及人民是主张团结一切抗日力量，以便击败日寇的，而蒋介石则分裂抗日阵线，利用抗战不断的削弱乃至消灭非嫡系军队。首先是东北军与十七路军，对中共领导的抗日军队更不惜实行内战。中共及人民是主张实行民主，以便能动员人民的一切力量，坚持抗战的。而蒋介石则厉行独裁，压迫人民，使抗战陷于无力。在这种情形下，要不是中共在敌后努力，人民在全国坚持，中国的抗战早已被蒋介石断送了。所以日寇已经投降，蒋介石便利用日俘，收编伪军，进行更大规模的反共反人民的内战。
    今年一月在全国人民渴望和平民主声中，蒋介石又曾被逼的勉强的接受过停战协定与政协决议，但不久便被他所指使的南京二月整军会议与重庆三月二中全会或明或暗的推翻了，等到东北大打与关内大打，更证明他接受政协决议与停战协定决非心甘情愿。不过内战发展到最近五个月，侵占我解放区这样多的地方，现在又在开着一党包办的非法的分裂的“国大”，一切欺骗伎俩都被他自己揭穿无遗了。
    就这一年中的情况看来，蒋介石与中国人民之间依然继续着西安事变以前及西安事变以后的两条路线的斗争。抗战胜利后，中共及人民是主张依照政协路线实现和平民主与独立，坚决拥护一月停战令，主张政协决议的依序实施，反对美帝国主义干涉中国内政，要求撤退驻华美军，停止援蒋内战。而蒋介石则不惜破坏政协路线，坚决走上内战独裁与卖国的道路，他企图以武力消灭解放区，以“宪法”形式使他的独裁合法化，以亡国的“中美商约”出卖民族利益，换取美帝国主义更多的援助来进行内战，但他这种企图一定会如十年前进行内战时一样遭遇到悲惨的失败。
    现在的大势所趋，人心所向，是和平民主与独立。美帝国主义独霸世界奴役人民的企图，将引导自己到众叛亲离。蒋介石独霸中国奴役人民的企图，亦将引导自己到众叛亲离。蒋介石想追随美帝国主义之后寻找出路，结果必走到悬崖绝壁，只有政协的路线才是康庄大道。人民的世纪已经降临，中国的民主新高潮不可避免的要到来。解放区人民自卫战争的坚持和胜利，反动统治区爱国民主运动的发展，各国人民的进步，将促进这一新高潮的到来。历史的发展会警告反动统治者，内战、独裁、卖国的绝路是不是要走到底。
    就在目前，蒋介石还高谈“政治解决”，然而多数人已经知道这是骗局或者叫做“和平攻势”，为辨别这一“政治解决”的真伪，我们只要求他立刻解散正在开会的一党包办的非法的分裂的“国大”，承认恢复一月停战令所规定的双方军队的位置，国共谈判便可重开，蒋介石如果肯这样做，那才有回到政协路线上的可能。不然，中国人民就会看得更清楚，对于蒋介石“武力消灭解放区”才是他的目的，“政治解决”不过是他的欺骗口号而已。
    我们相信经过西安事变以来的十年经验教训，中国人民是再不会上当的了。
