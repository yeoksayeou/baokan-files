Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the United Press on the 8th of this month, citing a Kaifeng report from the Shanghai newspaper: Henan has suffered a poor harvest this year. The little grain that farmers had has been completely plundered by the Chiang government's exorbitant taxes and levies, and compulsory borrowing and purchases. The food crisis is severe, with eight million people having nothing to eat. This year's spring wheat harvest in the province was 30% lower than normal, and the autumn grain harvest was 50% lower. The situation is extremely dire due to the Nationalist troops stationed in the area collecting and seizing grain from the farmers.

Furthermore, according to a special Guangzhou dispatch from the Shanghai Wenhui Bao on the 22nd of last month: Relief agencies have investigated the number of refugees in Guangdong Province awaiting relief. According to incomplete statistics, the number has already exceeded eight million. If other counties are included, it will exceed ten million, which is one-third of the province's population (note that the province's population has already decreased by 1.5 million since 1939, and is now 30.08 million). There is one county with over 800,000 refugees awaiting relief, two counties with over 300,000, four counties with over 200,000, and nine counties with over 100,000.

    河南蒋管区
    饥民八百万
    【新华社延安十日电】据合众社本月八日上海讯，摘引沪报开封消息：河南今年歉收，农民仅有之粮食为蒋政府的苛捐杂税与征借征实搜刮殆尽，粮食危机严重，有八百万人无以为生。该省今年春麦较正常年景歉收百分之三十，秋粮歉收百分之五十。由于缴扎该地区的国民党军征收及抢购农民的粮食，使情况极为恶劣。
    又据沪文汇报上月二十二日广州专电：救济机关调查广东全省待救难民数目，据不完全统计数字，已过八百万人，若把其他县份算入，将超过一千万人，即占全省人口三分之一，（按该省人口已较民国二十八年锐减一百五十万人，现在有三千零八十万）。待救难民超过八十万者一县、超过三十万者二县、超过二十万者四县、超过十万者九县。
