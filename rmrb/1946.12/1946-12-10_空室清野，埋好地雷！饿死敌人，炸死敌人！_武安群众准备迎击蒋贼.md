　　Empty the houses and fields, plant landmines! Starve the enemy, blow up the enemy!
  　The people of Wu'an are preparing to repel bandit Chiang!
    [Reported from Wu'an by this newspaper] More than 10,000 citizens of Wu'an gathered on the 1st for a general mobilization for war preparedness. Many liberated people spoke eagerly at the meeting. Ren Shuang, from the Eighth Street People's Association, said: "I used to be a water carrier, but now I have been liberated, have status, and have property. Chiang Kai-shek is going to attack again, and we are determined to resist." He called on everyone to "empty the houses and fields to starve the enemy; plant landmines to blow up the enemy; arm ourselves to trap the enemy!" The militia captain reported that he had studied more than 20 ways to plant landmines. All the militiamen proposed: "We must step up our learning of how to set up minefields, so that when the enemy comes in, they will not be able to get out, and we will blow them to smithereens!" The women of the Tenth Street also learned how to make stone mines, and proposed at the meeting to compete with the self-defense forces of their street to see who could make more and better mines. Retired soldier Li Guanghua said that he would definitely lead the militia back to the front line to defend Wu'an and Chairman Mao with his blood. The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said at the meeting: "When the Japanese were here, we couldn't do business properly. If Chiang and the Americans come, we won't be able to do business at all." Businessman Li Deyi vowed: "I am determined not to sell American goods!"
    [Another report] Anquan County is actively preparing for the self-defense war and has divided the county into two sub-command headquarters in the north and south, one general command headquarters, and a rear command headquarters. Each command headquarters has departments for armed forces, propaganda, logistics, and secretarial work, and has established systems for liaison and reporting. Cadres at the county, district, and village levels have all learned the two major techniques of planting landmines and throwing bombs. Currently, the county is promoting intensive military training for the militia, as well as war preparedness, martial law, and the emptying of houses and fields. (Chen Xiangxin)
