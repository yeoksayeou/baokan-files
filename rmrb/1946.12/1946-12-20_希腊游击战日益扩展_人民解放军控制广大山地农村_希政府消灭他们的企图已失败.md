　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: A French news agency dispatch from Ankara reports: The war between Greek guerrillas and government forces is intensifying. The Thrace and Salonika areas are like a country in a state of war. For five days, guerrillas have been engaged in fierce battles with government forces near Maritza. The results have not yet been announced. The strength of the guerrillas is increasing daily, and they control vast mountainous and rural areas. Farmers are joining the guerrillas en masse. The port of Salonika is surrounded on three sides by guerrillas, and the mountains behind it are controlled by the guerrillas.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: New York dispatch: As the Greek government's attempt to eliminate the People's Liberation Army has failed and guerrilla warfare is spreading, it is seeking foreign assistance. To this end, Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris arrived in New York earlier this month and visited Bevin and Byrnes separately. On the 4th, he accused the so-called "South Bao and Albania of aiding the guerrillas in northern Greece" to the Security Council. The Security Council began discussing this issue on the 12th.

　　希腊游击战日益扩展
    人民解放军控制广大山地农村 
    希政府消灭他们的企图已失败
    【新华社延安十六日电】法新闻处安哥拉消息：希腊游击队与政府军的战事愈演愈烈，色雷利与萨罗尼加区就如一个处于战时的国家一样。五天来，游击队在马里查附近与政府军进行激烈战斗，结果尚未公布。游击队的实力日渐增强，控制着广大山地与农村，农民纷纷参加游击队，萨罗尼加港已为游击队三面包围，其背后山地均被游击队控制。
    【新华社延安十五日电】纽约讯：希腊政府于消灭人民解放军的企图失败及游击战争日益蔓延之际，正力谋获得外国之援助。希总理查达雷斯为此于本月初抵纽约，分别拜访贝文与贝纳斯，并于四日向安全理事会控诉其所谓“南保及阿尔巴尼亚三国援助希腊北部游击队”事，安理会已于十二日开始讨论此问题。
