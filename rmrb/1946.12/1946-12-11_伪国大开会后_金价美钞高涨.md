Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 8th: Nanjing Dispatch: During the period of the Chiang Kai-shek's National Assembly meeting, the situation in the KMT-controlled areas became increasingly tense, and people were restless. The prices of gold and US dollars in Nanjing and Shanghai continued to soar. As of December 7th, the black market price of gold in Nanjing had risen from "242,000 before the opening of the National Assembly to 310,000," and the US dollar had risen from 4,200 to 5,100. In Shanghai, gold rose from 246,200 to 300,600. Previously, on the 6th, the Shanghai gold price, even after the "Central Bank dumped 130 ten-tael gold bars on Friday (the 6th)," still failed to curb the rise of the US dollar from 4,300 to 5,000. The Hong Kong dollar, which was usually not valued by merchants, also rose from 950 to 1,000. The price of US dollars in Shanghai once rose to 5,000 on November 15th, at the beginning of the "National Assembly." Now it has risen to this number again, and the price in Nanjing has greatly exceeded it. On the same day, the gold prices in other cities were several times higher than those in Nanjing and Shanghai: Guangzhou 339,000, Jinan 330,000, Taiyuan 358,000, Nanchang 325,000, and Fuzhou 310,000.

    伪国大开会后
    金价美钞高涨
    【新华社延安八日电】南京讯：在蒋记国大开会期中，蒋管区局势愈趋紧张，人心浮动，京沪黄金美钞继续猛涨。到本月七日止，南京黑市黄金已由“国大开幕前的二十四万二涨到三十一万”，美钞由四千二百涨到五千一百。上海黄金由二十四万六千二涨到三十万零六百。前此六日沪市金价虽经“中央银行星期五（即六日）倾销十两重金条一百三十条”，仍未能平抑美钞由四千三百涨到五千，平时为商人所不重视的港币，亦由九百零五十涨到一千。按上海美金价格于上月十五日“国大”开幕之初，即一度涨到五千，现再度涨至此数，而南京则已大为超过。同日其他各城市黄金价格，较京沪还高若干倍，广州三十三万九千，济南三十三万，太原三十五万八千，南昌三十二万五千，福州三十一万。
