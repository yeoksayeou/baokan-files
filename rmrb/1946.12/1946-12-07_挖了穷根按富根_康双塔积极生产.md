　　【Benbao Weixian Third Dispatch】Kang Shuangta Village in Jize, after rent reduction and the elimination of poverty, is actively engaged in production. The entire village has formed fourteen mutual aid groups and six textile groups, fully engaged in side businesses such as textile weaving, transportation, and sugar workshops. Within a month, the cattle trading group earned 10,000 yuan, and the six textile groups wove a total of 380 bolts of cloth, earning 40,000 yuan in silver dollars. The cotton ginning cooperative earned 60,000 yuan in silver dollars in two months. The militia's cigarette paper workshop in the village also earned 25,000 yuan in one month. To develop winter production, the masses in Suhu Village, Third District of Qi County, organized a cooperative with four cotton ginning machines. They hold meetings every five days, and members can raise any opinions at any time. Accounts are announced every ten days, and settlements are made at the end of each month. Shareholders can freely withdraw or invest. Impoverished masses who lack funds can buy cotton from the cooperative without paying immediately, and pay after weaving the cotton into cloth and earning money. In six days, they ginned a total of 600 jin of cotton, earning a dividend of 10,000 yuan.
