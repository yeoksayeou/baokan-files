Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, December 13th (Delayed Dispatch) On the tenth anniversary of the "Double Twelfth" Incident, the reporter interviewed General Zhang Xuesi, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee and younger brother of General Zhang Xueliang. General Zhang said: "After the Xi'an Incident occurred, I was in the Central Military Academy in Nanjing, and the Kuomintang detained me." After the War of Resistance, in order to restore the freedom of the patriotic Generals Zhang and Yang, General Zhang Xuesi traveled to Nanjing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and other places. Northeast Army generals such as Wu Ke-ren, Yu Xuezhong, Liu Duoquan, and Northeast elders such as Liu Zhe, Mo Dehui, Wang Shuchang, and Wan Fulin also wrote letters to Chiang Kai-shek, requesting the release of Zhang and Yang, but all were rejected. Even family members were prohibited from sending clothes and small items.

On July 20, 1937, General Zhang Xuesi met General Zhang Xueliang once in the Wenkoushan Mountains in Zhejiang. This was the only meeting in ten years. At that time, Zhang was staying at the China Travel Service, surrounded by more than 20 secret agents, and a battalion of military police was stationed nearby. The brothers' conversation was monitored by secret agents, and General Zhang Xueliang only urgently expressed: "Request to come out and resist Japan."

General Zhang expressed extreme indignation at Chiang Kai-shek's means of disintegrating, dispersing, disbanding, reorganizing, and changing designations to eliminate the Northeast Army. Zhang cited the Wu Keren unit of the 617th Army of the Northeast Army as an example. This army suffered heavy casualties while covering the retreat of the Central Army during the Battle of Shanghai, but Chiang Kai-shek did not restore its establishment, resulting in the elimination of the army. Zhang claimed that his ability to fight back to his hometown today was the result of the Chinese Communist Party's support for the Northeast People's Liberation Army. He finally called on the people of the Northeast to strengthen unity, intensify the fight, and smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. (Yang Geng)

　　张学思将军“双十二”发表谈话
    愤慨蒋贼消灭东北军
    号召东北人民团结粉碎蒋军进攻
    【新华社东北十三日电】（迟到）“双十二”十周年纪念日，记者走访张学良将军之弟东北政委会副主席张学思将军。张将军说：“西安事变发生后，我正在南京中央军校里，国民党就把我扣押起来。”抗战以后，为了恢复爱国无罪的张、杨两将军的自由，张学思将军曾奔走于京、沪、港、渝等地，东北军吴克仁、于学忠、刘多荃等将领，及东北耆老如刘哲、莫德惠、王树常、万福麟等，亦都写信给蒋介石，要求释放张、杨，但亦均遭拒绝，连家属送点衣服、零物都遭禁止。
    一九三七年七月廿日，张学思将军在浙江温口山中见过一次张学良将军，这是十年来仅有的一次会晤。当时张住在中国旅行社，周围有廿多个特务监视，附近驻扎有一营宪兵。兄弟见面谈话为特务监视，张学良将军只迫切表示：“要求出来抗日”。
    张将军对蒋介石以瓦解、分散、编遣、改换番号等手段，消灭东北军极为愤慨。张以东北军六一七军吴克仁部为例，该军曾在上海作战时，掩护中央军撤退，牺牲惨重，但蒋介石并不给他恢复建制，以致该军就此消灭。张自称今天能打回老家来，是由于中国共产党扶植东北人民子弟兵的结果。他最后号召东北人民，加强团结，加紧战斗、粉碎蒋介石的进攻。（杨赓）
