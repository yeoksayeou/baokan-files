　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th. The troops in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have launched a merit-earning campaign to prepare to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. After reading the short commentary "Merit-Earning Campaign" in the Liberation Daily, one unit immediately established a merit record book and selected a merit-building committee of seven to ten people, announcing the merit-building regulations at a soldiers' meeting. Combat hero Zhang Zhiguo convened a heroes' meeting and launched a merit-earning competition among various units and squads. Another unit held a merit-earning mobilization meeting on the 16th of last month, rewarding 69 combat heroes. Yuan Huailiang, the squad leader of the second squad, strove to earn merit and automatically sharpened bayonets for the entire squad. Another unit also signed joint defense pacts with the militia. The joint defense pact of one squad proposed "four wants, three don'ts" for shooting. The four wants are: want to shoot machine gunners, want to shoot commanders, want to aim accurately, and want to shoot at targets that pose the greatest threat to us; the three don'ts are: don't shoot at distant targets, don't shoot at targets you are not sure of hitting, and don't shoot if you can't aim accurately.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th. Ma Hongkui's 19th Regiment of the 10th Cavalry Brigade of the Chiang army in Ningxia, in order to coordinate with Hu Zongnan's army in the southern line of the offensive against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, launched an offensive from the western line against Yanchi in the Sanbian Sub-region of the Border Region on the 17th of last month, occupying Xingwuyingtun, Tianchizi, Niumaojing and other places in the second district of Yanchi. Part of the 103rd Regiment of Ma Hongbin's 35th Brigade also occupied the Shixxx area at the same time. On the morning of the xth of this month, the Chiang army continued to attack in the xxx direction. The army and civilians in the area fought bravely and resisted fiercely for seven hours, repelling the invading army and taking advantage of the victory to recover the occupied areas, capturing more than 130 Chiang soldiers alive, killing and wounding more than 70, and seizing more than 80 warhorses, 100 pigs, and other war materials that are still being inventoried.
