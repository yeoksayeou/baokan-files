Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: A comprehensive dispatch from United Press and Associated Press, Washington, 18th: Democratic Senator Morley and Republican Senator Flanders jointly issued a statement on the 18th, urging the United States to cease all aid to Chiang Kai-shek. They suggested that Washington take the lead in convening a round table conference of leaders from the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and the major political parties in China, including the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, to lay the foundation for a united and peaceful government based on the spirit of the United Nations. The statement also stated that once the three powers have completed their mission after the meeting, they should "announce their withdrawal from the Chinese political whirlpool." The statement further stated that the United States has no possibility of solving this problem alone, and that our own interests have been deeply affected, and that it is almost impossible to convince the Chinese people or the world that the United States can be a fair mediator. China has not yet established a united government dedicated to peaceful revival. The CCP has not received assistance from the Soviet Union, but has gained support for its resistance after seizing American weapons from the hands of the Kuomintang army. In the eyes of the entire Chinese people, American supplies have been regarded as a major reason for continuing to prolong the civil war, resulting in the destruction of the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. The statement also refuted the claim that "if the United States does not fully assist Chiang Kai-shek, China will become a Soviet satellite state," calling it a malicious distortion, similar to Hitler's use of "anti-Bolshevism" to divide the world. The statement concluded by stating that they are now considering submitting a bill to the Senate, requesting the Senate to keep a record book of their proposal to convene an international conference. In addition to Senators Morley and Flanders, the statement was also signed by Lattimore (Professor at Johns Hopkins University, former advisor to Chiang Kai-shek), McNair (Professor at the University of Chicago, author of books on American Far Eastern policy), Fisch (Professor at Stanford University, Director of the Hoover War, Revolution and Peace Library), and Dulles (Professor at Ohio University, author of books on American relations with China and the Philippines). This statement was issued a few hours before Truman's statement on American policy toward China.

　　美国人民公正舆论的代表
    莫莱等六人发表文告
    促美政府停止援蒋
    建议召集圆桌会议
    由苏美英法与中国主要政党领袖参加
    依联合国精神奠定中国联合政府基础
    【新华社延安廿八日电】综合合众社美联社华府十八日电：美民主党参议员莫莱与共和党议员佛兰德斯十八日联名发表文告督促美国停止对蒋介石之一切援助，建议由华盛顿方面出面召集苏、英、法三国与中国各主要政党领袖，包括国民党及共产党在内举行圆桌会议，根据联合国机构之精神，以奠定联合和平政府之基础。该文告并称：一俟会后三强完成其任务后，三强应“宣布退出中国政治漩涡”文告又称：美国实无单独解决此一问题之可能，我国本身利益已深受其累，殆已无法可使中国人民或世界人民相信美国可为公平之调解人。中国迄今尚无致力于和平复兴之联合政府成立，中共并未获得苏联之接济，但自国军手中缴获其美式武器后，已获支持其抵抗的力量。在中国全体人民心目中，美方供应品已被视为继续拖延内战之重大原因，其结果乃为破坏中美两国人民传统的友谊。文告并驳斥一倘美国不以全力援助蒋氏，则中国将成为苏联卫星国”之说称，此为怀有恶意之歪论，殆与希特勒利用“反布尔塞维克主义”以分裂世界之用意相同。文告最后称：现已考虑在参院提出议案，要求参院对他们建议召开国际会议留下记录簿。署于该文告者，除莫莱与佛兰德斯两参议员外，尚有拉铁摩尔（约翰霍浦金斯大学教授，曾任蒋介石顾问）、麦克奈亚（芝加哥大学教授，美国远东政策问题作家）、费煦（斯丹福大学教授，胡佛战争革命和平图书馆主任）、杜尔斯（俄亥俄大学教授，美国对华对菲关系问题作家）等四人。按此文告系发表于杜鲁门关于美国对华政策声明之前数小时。
