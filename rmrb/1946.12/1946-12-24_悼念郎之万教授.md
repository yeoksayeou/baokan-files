　　In Memory of Professor Paul Langevin
    News has arrived that the great French scientist Professor Paul Langevin has passed away in Paris. This is a great loss to the world's scientific community, a great loss to the French people and the people of the world. We express our deep and sorrowful condolences for the death of this great scientist and people's warrior!
    Langevin was one of the world's leading authoritative physicists of the modern era, having twice received the most prestigious medal from the British Royal Society. Before the Second World War, he, along with Romain Rolland and Henri Barbusse, led progressive people around the world in the anti-fascist and anti-war movement, resisting the tyranny of Hitler and Franco, opposing the treasonous crimes of Daladier and Laval, unyielding and vigorous in his old age; he was even arrested and imprisoned in 1940. After his release, he continued to lead the resistance movement; and with his outstanding scientific achievements, he created new weapons, contributing to the French people's great cause of national salvation through land warfare.
    Like another world-renowned physicist, Madame Curie, Professor Langevin was a member of the French Communist Party. This is the glory of the French Communist Party, and also the glory of the French people. He used dialectical materialism to study science, thereby raising the level of world science. He used his profound scientific knowledge and all his energy to serve the peace, democracy, and progress of mankind. Therefore, in the hearts of the French people and the people of the world, Professor Langevin has become a model of the perfect combination of the highest wisdom and the greatest courage. Just as the French people are fighting for the cause of peace and democracy and moving towards victory today, Langevin's sudden passing is truly a great misfortune for the French people. However, we believe that the progressive and democratic people of France and the world will certainly be able to inherit and carry forward Langevin's great spirit of sacrificing and fighting for truth and human happiness, and continue their efforts to fulfill Langevin's遗志 [yízhì - cherished desire/legacy/will]. We, the Chinese people, especially thank Langevin for his kind concern and support for China's democratic and progressive cause during his lifetime, and vow to make the greatest efforts to realize China's independence, democracy, and prosperity, to live up to Professor Langevin's earnest expectations!

　　悼念郎之万教授
    电讯传来，法国大科学家郎之万教授在巴黎去世了。这是全世界科学界的大损失，是法国人民和全世界人民的大损失。我们对于这位伟大的科学家和人民战士之死，谨致深切和沈痛的悼念！
    郎氏是现代世界有数的权威物理学家，曾经两次得过英国皇家学会最光荣的奖章。在二次大战前，他和罗曼罗兰、巴比塞一道，领导全世界进步人士进行反法西斯反战运动，反抗希特勒和佛朗哥的暴政，反对达拉第、赖伐尔的卖国罪行，不屈不挠，老当益壮；以致在一九四零年被捕下狱。出狱后，继续领导抵抗运动；并以其卓越的科学成就，创制新式武器，贡献于法国人民的陆战救国大业。
    和另一世界权威物理学家居里博士一样，郎之万教授是一位法国共产党的党员。这是法国共产党的光荣，也是法国人民的光荣。他用了唯物辩证法来研究科学，以此来提高世界科学的水平。他以高深的科学造诣与他的全部精力，为人类的和平民主与进步服务。因此，在法国人民与全世界人民心目中，郎之万教授已经成为最高的智慧与最大的勇敢圆满结合的典型。正当今天法国人民为和平民主事业奋斗而向胜利迈进的时候，郎氏遽尔与世长辞，这实在是法国人民的大不幸。但是，我们相信，法国和全世界的进步民主人士，一定能够继承和发扬郎氏为真理与人类幸福而牺牲奋斗的伟大精神，再接再厉，以完成郎氏的遗志。我们中国人民特别感谢郎氏生前对中国民主进步事业的亲切关怀与支援，并誓以最大的努力实现中国的独立民主与繁荣，以副郎之万教授殷切的期望！（十二月二十一日）
