Not Forgetting War Preparations During the New Year
　　Chiang Kai-shek's Troops Plot to Invade Daming Again
　　Jinnan Military and Civilians Stand Ready
　　[Our newspaper, Handan, 28th dispatch] The New Year is approaching, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops, including the Fifth Army's 32nd Division, gathered along the Qingfeng and Neihuang line, are now actively carrying out various preparations to invade us. One brigade of the 85th Division, originally stationed in the Pinghan, Qixian, and Jixian areas, also advanced to Chu Wang and Hui Long, north of Neihuang, on the 26th, and another brigade is also advancing towards Neihuang from north of Xinxiang. The 40th Division, entrenched in Anyang, has also gathered in Anyang City in recent days. The Chiang Kai-shek military strongholds in the border areas of the line have also been intensifying their war preparations in recent days. Considering the situation from top to bottom, the Chiang Kai-shek troops' intention this time is to invade Daming to the north and take advantage of the New Year holiday to launch offensives against our border counties. Our entire region's military and civilians must, with the spirit of not forgetting war during the New Year, heighten our vigilance and intensify preparations to give the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops a powerful counterattack at any time. Military Region observers pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek troops' plan to invade Daming was expected by the Military Region long ago. Our Jinnan military and civilians have made full preparations and thorough arrangements, and will surely give the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops a heavy blow.
