　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd: The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Suzhong pieced together the remnants of the 435th Regiment of the 21st Division, the 79th Brigade of the 49th Division, the 460th and 461st Regiments of the 65th Division, and a portion of the 67th Division, totaling seven regiments. Starting from the 20th of last month, they launched a comprehensive "encirclement and suppression" campaign in the six counties of Qi, Haimen, Nantong, Rudong (Rugao East), Zishi, and Dongtai, east of Fangongbao. The local military and civilians fought bravely against them. As of November 20th, they had killed or wounded over 640 Chiang Kai-shek troops and removed seven important villages and towns, including Chuangang in northeast Haimen and Beiliuqiao in northern Nantong. The Chiang Kai-shek troops were overwhelmed and beaten everywhere. On November 20th, a local armed force ambushed two battalions of the Chiang Kai-shek 45th Division east of Baipu, killing or wounding over 160 of them. In late October, local armed forces in Haimen and Qidong killed over 50 Chiang Kai-shek troops. On the 23rd of the same month, over 100 guerrillas in Rugao routed over 800 Chiang Kai-shek troops in the Caijiazhuang area east of Rugao, killing or wounding 42 of them, while the New Fourth Army suffered only two minor injuries.
