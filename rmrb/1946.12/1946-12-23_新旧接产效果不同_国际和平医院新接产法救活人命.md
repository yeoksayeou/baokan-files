　　Different Results from New and Old Delivery Methods
    International Peace Hospital's New Delivery Method Saves Lives
    [This newspaper's dispatch] According to a report from Zhang Yan of the International Peace Hospital: Women in Anhe Village, Shahe, using old-fashioned midwives for delivery not only increased infant mortality rates, but also caused many pregnant women to die prematurely. However, under the new-style midwifery methods of Dr. Yu at the International Peace Hospital, pregnant women and infants in difficult labor have been given new life. On the 2nd of this month, when Shi Shuanzi, a woman from the village, was in labor, she was cared for by a midwife for a day and a night, but she could not give birth. Moreover, the midwife's unskilled assistance and disregard for hygiene resulted in a vaginal tear that began to fester. The pregnant woman, in a critical situation, was rescued by Dr. Yu's patient treatment, and both mother and child were saved. Upon hearing this, the women of Anhe Village were extremely happy, saying, "With Dr. Yu, the pain of childbirth for women can be solved." The hospital's spirit of serving the masses through childbirth has been warmly supported by the people of Anhe. Within fifty days, the hospital treated more than sixty villagers. Women from Anhe Village also voluntarily helped hospital patients by sewing quilts, doing it quickly and well.
