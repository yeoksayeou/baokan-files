To all students of Peking University and Chaoyang University:

I have a twenty-year history with these two schools. It can be said that they are my first home, and I have taught law at these schools. It can also be said that law is my second life and learning is my second sustenance. Therefore, after the recovery of Beiping, I continued to teach at the Provisional University and Chaoyang University. The authorities of Peking University and Chaoyang University invited me to teach as before, and I initially did not refuse. Unfortunately, I ultimately went against my wishes. Because of the Zhongshan Park incident, I was beaten and bloodied by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. I then realized that I could no longer continue my lifelong career in a university controlled by Chiang's forces. I had to reluctantly resign from the teaching positions I had already taken and felt unable to accept future invitations under the tutelage system. Now I can only say that I cannot see the students of the two schools for a while, which is what makes me most sad. I can boast to you that I am a "loyal and righteous person." In the judiciary, the legal profession, and the education field, I have always "fought for justice." For example, resigning to oppose Cao Kun's bribery election can be said to be an example of fighting for justice in the judiciary; refusing an appointment to oppose Principal Liu Zhe can be said to be an example of fighting for justice in the education field; refusing to accept defense cases involving corruption and drugs can be said to be an example of fighting for justice in the legal profession. Now I am making the greatest determination to fight for justice in the political arena to the end. I have always been apolitical, but now I am going to change direction and fight for politics because politics is everyone's business. Humans are "political animals," just as fish are aquatic animals. Fish cannot live without water, and humans cannot live without politics. It is time to "study without forgetting to love the country." We, the students of Peking University, have always been the vanguard of the people; we, the students of Chaoyang University, have always had legal expertise. Now is the time for the people to fight for democracy and for the law to fight for righteousness. It is also the time for all students to greatly awaken.

I am a person without party affiliation and without prejudice. My purpose in writing to you now is not to promote others or to boast about myself in the slightest. It is simply because politics is everyone's business and humanity is inherently "political animals," just as fish are aquatic animals. Fish cannot live without water, and humans cannot live without politics. It is time to "study without forgetting to love the country." We, the students of Peking University, have always been the vanguard of the people; we, the students of Chaoyang University, have always had legal expertise. Now is the time for the people to fight for democracy and for the law to fight for righteousness. It is also the time for all students to greatly awaken.

I am someone who has lived in both the Chiang-controlled areas and the liberated areas—someone who can correctly understand and fairly judge. I can guarantee with my conscience that these two regions are one heaven and one hell. The people's suffering and happiness, the political clarity and turbidity, the good and bad security, and the good and evil economy are two extreme contrasts. Just take the three things of the eradication of corruption, the eradication of bandits, and the eradication of beggars as examples. I ask, can the Chiang-controlled areas be compared with the liberated areas? As for ideology, one is just slogans and banners, while the other is practice. The CCP is now implementing New Democracy and New Capitalism, and is uniting with intellectuals to participate in political power. Society and politics are constantly progressing. In today's world, if we only implement old constitutionalism and old democracy, we will eventually go down the path of old capitalism and fascism. What's more, the path that Chiang Kai-shek and his followers have taken before and after is an extreme authoritarian and unprincipled fascist pseudo-democracy and anti-constitutionalism, and they are even going down a path that German fascists dared not take. In addition to using Himmler's and the Japanese militarists' "secret agent policies," they are also promoting Chiang's original "selling-out-the-country civil war policy," selling out the country on a large scale and fighting on a large scale, so that everyone is now unable to live. Even seeking to be Chiang's and America's peaceful slaves is impossible. Chiang Kai-shek holds American-equipped troops in one hand and "legal authority"—the "National Assembly,"—an illegal group of Chiang's private party and household servants, in the other, to make our people submit. If we do not submit, he will use his "appointed constitution" and his privately raised lackeys to sweep away all democratic political power and troops. Now the methods and forces he is using have reached their limit. I can predict that his demise is not far away. Chiang Kai-shek is the most shameful and hateful autocrat and traitor in Chinese and foreign history. If he succeeds, there will be no history and no humanity.

Students, do not fail to live up to the glorious tradition and abandon the responsibility of moving forward. Now is the critical moment for the life and death of the nation and the people. For freedom, for democracy, for survival, for independence, let us all rise up! This is not the time for us intellectuals to watch and hesitate any longer.

    致北大和朝阳同学书
    陈瑾昆
    北大和朝阳诸位同学：
    我同二校是有二十年历史，可以说二校是我的第一故乡，我在二校是讲授法律，并可以说法律是我的第二生命，学问是我的第二食粮，所以我在北平光复后，就先后仍然在临大同朝阳讲课，北大和朝阳当局约请照旧任教，最初也未固辞，不幸终违本愿。因为中山公园事件，我是被蒋家特务打得头破血流，我于是看清在蒋系势力支配下的大学，是再不能继续我的终身事业，只得忍痛将当时已担任的教务辞去；未来被约请的教务，也认为在训导制度下无法接受。现在是只好同二校同学一时不能相见了，这是我最伤心的。我一生可以向诸位自夸，堪称为“忠义之士”，在司法界、在律师界、在教育界，遇事都是“为正义奋斗”。如为反对曹锟贿选而辞职，可说是在司法界为正义奋斗的一例；为反对刘哲校长而却聘，可说是在教育界为正义奋斗的一例；拒受贪污毒品辩护案件，可说是在律师界为正义奋斗的一例。现在更下最大决心，要在政治界为正义而奋斗到底。我一向是不问政治的，而现在却要转变方向为政治而奋斗，是因为中国若是让蒋介石同他的徒党——国民党内顽固自私分子胡闹下去，就是说无法律，无教育、无学问、无正义，我仍如以前过我的舒适优越生活，那只是槁木死灰、行尸走肉，只计一人安危，不管众人死活，何以对国家对民族对自己？更何以称学者称先觉称正士？所以我放弃了我的旧事业——终身教育事业；开始我的新生活——民主奋斗生活，固然一面是我最痛心的事，但是一面也是我最快心的事。
    我是一个无党派的人，也是一个无偏见的人，我现在致书给诸位同学，决没有为他人宣传和为自己鼓吹的丝毫意思，只是因为政治是大家的事，人类正是“政治动物”，如同鱼类是水族动物一样，鱼类是不能离水而活，人类是不能离政治而活的。是“读书勿忘爱国”时候了。我们北大同学，自来是人民先锋；我们朝阳同学，自来是法律特长，现在正是人民要争民主的时候，法律要争正气的时候了。也正是诸同学要大大觉悟的时候了。
    我是在蒋管区与解放区都生活过了的人，——是一个能正确了解公平判断的人，我可以拿良心保证，这两个区域一个是天堂，一个是地狱；人民的苦乐，政治的清浊，治安的好坏，经济的良恶，正是两个极端的对比。单拿贪污绝迹、盗匪绝迹、乞丐绝迹三者来说，试问蒋管区能否同解放区相比？至于主义，一个只是口号标语，一个则是身体力行。中共现在是实行新民主主义与新资本主义，且联合知识阶级参加政权，社会与政治本是不断进步的，现在的世界如果只行旧宪政与旧民主，也是终久必走入旧资本主义与法西斯政策的末路，何况蒋介石同他的徒党以前和以后所走的道路，更是极端的专制无道的法西斯假民主反宪政，而且是走德国法西斯所不敢走的路，除了沿用希墨和日本军阀的“特务政策”而外，还畅行蒋家独创的“卖国内战政策”，大卖其国、大打其仗，弄得目前已是人人都不能活，即求当蒋家与美国的太平奴隶，亦不可得。蒋介石一手拿美械军队，一手拿“法统”——“国民大会”，——蒋家私党家臣的违法集团，要使我们人民屈服；若不屈服，就要想凭他的“钦定宪法”，和他的私豢走狗，把一切民主政权和军队扫平。现在他用的方法和力量，都已到了尽头了，我可以断定他的消灭是为期不远了。蒋介石是中外历史上一个最可耻可恨的专制者、卖国贼，他要是能成功，即是要无历史无人类了。
    同学们莫要辜负了传统光荣，放弃了前进责任，现在正是国家民族死活的紧要关头，为自由、为民主、为生存、为独立，大家起来吧！不是我们知识阶级再观望再踌躇的时候了。
