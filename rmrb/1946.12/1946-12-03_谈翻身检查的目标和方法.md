After the high tide of the mass movement, the problems between landlords and peasants are no longer very obvious, and the activities of treacherous and domineering landlords often take on hidden forms. Furthermore, cadres and activists are often easily satisfied with the enthusiasm that the masses have already shown and fail to see the problems. Therefore, it is very necessary to conduct a thorough and meticulous checkup.

According to a submission from the Sixth District of En County, their turning-over checkup after the big movement has been completed. Their approach was to conduct it on a sub-district basis, with the sub-district representatives combining with outstanding village cadres and mass leaders to form a checkup team. They conducted door-to-door investigations, visiting families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, members and non-members of the peasant association, hired laborers, etc., to ask what difficulties they had encountered after turning over, to investigate the situation of fruit distribution, the merits and demerits of cadres, and whether the middle peasants were harmed in the struggle. Their experience is that small villages of thirty to forty households can be checked in just over a day, while large and more complex villages take three or four days, and a sub-district takes twenty days. There are several points worth considering in the approach of the Sixth District: First, is it appropriate to focus the checkup on the distribution of fruit and the problems of cadres? Second, can the checkup team discover the basic problems existing among the masses by conducting separate visits in a short period of time? We believe that in order to truly achieve the goal of completely eliminating feudal exploitation and repelling the conspiracy of the landlords' counterattack through the turning-over checkup, it is first necessary to clarify the key point of the checkup: whether the landlords and bullies have been overthrown or not? This requires not only seeing their superficial weakening but also seeing whether they still have various tricks such as hiding land secretly and threatening the masses in secret. Do not look at their superficial cries of poverty, but look at whether they have actually been subdued? Whether there are still any activities of instigating discord. In order to clarify this issue, on the other hand, it is necessary to carefully examine the degree of improvement in the ideological consciousness of the masses, and whether all peasants have truly turned over. In short, the degree to which feudal exploitation has been eliminated and the degree to which peasants have turned over should be the two basic aspects of the checkup work.

Secondly, the approach should be to launch a mass checkup. It should be understood that launching a checkup is also a process of mobilizing the masses. The Neiqiu turning-over checkup experience published on page two of this newspaper on December 8 adopted the method of mobilizing the masses to continue to pour out their grievances and offer opinions to each other, and promoted mutual checks among the masses on whether they had turned over, thereby discovering many problems and helping those who had not turned over to turn over. This can be used as a reference. Thirdly, after the big movement, there are still problems between cadres and the masses, and problems within the peasants, such as struggling against middle peasants or disputes between peasants. These problems must be well resolved in the turning-over checkup, and methods such as untying knots and explaining ideas can be adopted.

In short, from the perspective of the entire process of mobilizing the masses to implement "land to the tiller," the turning-over checkup is an in-depth stage and also an important step to demand the final and complete elimination of feudal exploitation so that landlords and bullies cannot make a comeback. The arduousness and complexity of the work are no less than the mobilization stage, and it should be carried out very carefully. We hope that everyone, especially the cadres who actually lead the movement in various places, will point out whether what we have proposed is appropriate.

### 谈翻身检查的目标和方法

　　谈翻身检查的目标和方法
    群运高潮过后，地主农民间的问题已经不十分明显，奸霸地主的活动也往往采取隐蔽的方式，而干部积极分子又往往容易满足于群众已经起来的热情而看不到问题。因之，进行一次深入细致的检查就非常必要。
    据恩县六区来稿，他们在大动过后的翻身大检查，业已进行完毕。在作法上是以小区为单位进行，由小区代表结合优秀村干部与群众领袖组成检查队，进行挨门挨户调查，分头访问抗属烈属、农会会员非会员、雇工等翻身后有什么困难，调查果实分配情形，干部的功劳缺点及斗争中是否伤害了中农等。他们的经验是三四十户的小村一天多即可检查完毕，大村和比较复杂的村要三、四天，一个小区要二十天。六区这种作法有几点值得考虑：第一、把检查的重点放在分果实上与干部问题上是否妥当？第二是检查队在短时间内分头访问是否能发现群众中存在的基本问题。我们认为如果要做到经过翻身检查，真正达到彻底消灭封建剥削的目的，打退地主反攻的阴谋，首先要明确检查的重点是地主恶霸斗倒了没有？这就不仅要看到他表面的削弱，而且要看他是否还有各种隐蔽土地、暗地威吓群众等诡计。不看他表面哭穷，而要看他实际是否斗服了？是否还有什么阴谋挑拨的活动。为了把这个问题弄得清楚，另一方面就必须仔细考查群众思想觉悟的提高程度，所有农民是否真正都翻了身等问题。总之，检查封建剥削消灭的程度与农民翻身的程度，应是检查工作的两个基本方面。
    其次，在作法上应该是发动群众性的大检查，须知发动检查同样是发动群众的过程。本报十二月八日二版发表的内邱翻身检查经验，采取发动群众继续诉苦互提意见的方法，并推动群众间相互检查是否翻过身，从而发现了很多问题，帮助没翻身的人翻了身，可以参考。第三，大动过后，还遗留有干部与群众之间的问题，农民内部的问题，如斗了中农，或农民之间的纠葛等问题，这在翻身检查中还必须很好解决，可采取解圪瘩，说通思想等方法。
    总之，从整个发动群众贯彻实现耕者有其田讲，翻身检查是深入阶段，也是要求最后彻底消灭封建剥削，使地主奸霸不能死灰复燃的重要步骤，工作之艰苦复杂，决不亚于发动阶段，应该十分认真进行才对。所提是否有当，还望大家特别是各地实际领导运动的干部加以指正。
