Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 10th: TASS reports: The first congress of Slavic peoples after the war was held on the 8th in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. Representatives from Slavic countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, as well as representatives of Slavic residents in other countries around the world, attended. Rokovslovts, President of the University of Belgrade, served as the chairman of the congress. Secretary-General of the congress, Mochalov, commented in an article on the holding of the congress, pointing out that the congress is of great significance not only to the Slavic peoples but also to world peace. Mochalov said: The unity of the Slavic peoples was one of the important conditions for the defeat of Fascism in the last war. At present, international reactionary forces are attempting to split the unity of the Slavic peoples and interfere in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia and other countries, but the Slavic peoples will not allow any external interference. They are fully determined to fight for the consolidation of independence, democracy, and peace. Slavic cooperation and strengthening friendship with the Soviet Union will serve as a guarantee against the recurrence of German or any other aggression. The Slavic Congress, which opened in Belgrade on the 8th, will discuss this cooperation and resolve its organizational issues.

Also, according to a Bucharest dispatch: The plenary session of the Balkan Youth League opened on the 7th in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. Representatives from Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania, and Hungary participated. The main purpose of the conference is to discuss the unity of the youth of various countries.
