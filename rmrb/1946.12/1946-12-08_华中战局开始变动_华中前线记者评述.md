　　Situation in Central China Begins to Shift
    Commentary from Central China Frontline Reporter
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th] A reporter on the Central China front recently commented on the current military situation on that front, stating: The victories in the Lianshui Campaign and on both sides of Baojia River have begun to shift the military situation in Central China. First, when the Guangxi faction of Chiang's troops suffered a disastrous defeat on both sides of the Baojia River, they begged the defeated 74th Division for reinforcements. When the 74th Division launched a full-scale northward attack, our army immediately swung south, directly threatening Lianghuai. This situation forced the 74th Division to retreat in panic. Second, the war scene is also different from the past. When Chiang's troops attacked Lianshui, they coordinated operations with airplanes, artillery, machine guns, and trucks, coming on aggressively. However, in the recent Baojia River campaign, our firepower was at least as strong as Chiang's troops, with both sides mainly using machine guns and artillery. The most brilliant scene was the Songji battle, where our artillery fire was so fierce that it forced the notoriously stubborn Guangxi faction of Chiang's troops to crawl in their trenches, unable to raise their heads. The majority of Chiang's troops were killed, while our army only suffered twenty casualties. Our weapons and ammunition are mainly equipped by obtaining them from Chiang Kai-shek. In the Battle of Lianshui, our army consumed only over 100,000 rounds of ammunition, while capturing nearly 400,000 rounds, which is one example. Third, facts prove that we are becoming stronger as we fight. Taking the Fifth Company of the ×× Regiment of the ×× Unit as an example, in the three months from mid-July to mid-October, the company captured a total of 23 machine guns, one Canadian submachine gun, five Thompson submachine guns, four grenade launchers, and hundreds of rifles from Chiang's troops. The number of prisoners of war was equal to four and a half Fifth Companies, and the captured weapons could equip two and a half infantry companies. Finally, Chiang's troops, whose cause is unjustifiable, are experiencing extremely serious desertion. According to deserters from the 52nd Division of Chiang's 28th Army, since the Lianshui campaign, an average of more than ten soldiers have deserted every day.

　　华中战局开始变动
    华中前线记者评述
    【新华社华中五日电】华中前线记者顷评述目前该线战局称：涟水战役与包家河两岸之捷，已使华中军事形势开始变动。首先，此次桂系蒋军在包家河两岸惨败时，乞怜于败军七十四师增援，当七十四师倾巢北犯，我军即挥戈南下直逼两淮，这一形势使七十四师不得不仓惶撤回。其次，战争场面亦与过去不同，蒋军进攻涟水时，飞机大炮机枪卡车配合作战，来势汹汹，而此次包家河战役，我方火力至少不弱于蒋军，双方用的主要是机枪和大炮。其中最精彩的一幕，是宋集战斗，我方炮火猛烈，迫使素称顽强之桂系蒋军爬伏战壕里无法抬头，大部蒋军死亡，而我军则仅伤亡二十人。我方的武器弹药，主要是从蒋介石那里源源获得装备起来的。涟水之战，我军消耗子弹仅十万余发，而缴获近四十万发，即为一例。第三，事实证明我方愈战愈强。以××部队××团五连为例，该连自七月中旬至十月中旬三个月中，共缴获蒋军机枪二十三挺，加拿大冲锋机一挺，汤姆式机枪五挺，掷弹筒四个，步枪数百支，俘虏人数等于四个半的五连，缴获的武器可装备两个半步兵连。最后是师出无名的蒋军，逃亡现象，极为严重。据蒋二十八军五十二师的逃兵谈，该连自涟水战役后，每天开小差的平均在十人以上。
