　　Guo Village Focuses on Ideological Education
　　Lu Village Dispels Fears of Political Change
　　[Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 20th] After cadres and activists in Guo Village, Tunliu, went door-to-door to check on the liberation of the masses, they found that 38 households in the village had not been thoroughly liberated and urgently needed to be leveled up and filled in. However, among these 38 households, some had ideological concerns and were "concerned about sentiments." During the mass liberation movement, they did not receive any fruits or received very little. Therefore, some activists suggested: "These people are too good, they don't offend anyone, and they still want to be liberated and eat ready-made meals." Some even proposed selling the houses, land, and grain stored in the village office to them at a low price and waiting until next year's harvest to discuss it further. After three days of deliberation and discussion, everyone finally said: "We were liberated first because we were awakened earlier, and they were not liberated because they were awakened later. Those who are awakened early should help the backward peasants to be liberated. All the peasants in the world are one family, and everyone should be liberated." The activists further proposed: "We should not only help these people get some fruits and be liberated, but also educate them for a long time to clear their minds. Otherwise, they will think that getting land and houses is giving them favors." This opinion was supported by all the peasants in the village. The chairman of the peasant association clearly announced to everyone: "Our peasants should not only be liberated in terms of property, but also in terms of politics, so that we can wipe out the feudal forces." They are now in the final stage of clearing away feudal forces.
　　[Report from this newspaper] According to a report from the Tunliu County Peasant Association: Lu Village recently discovered and resolved the backward masses' fear of political change and pity for landlords and local bullies during the mass movement. The masses' awareness has been raised, and the movement has made great progress. During the ideological examination, Huo Qinghai, vice chairman of the peasant association, said: "When Liu Shuanzhu introduced me to join the peasant association, I said: Shuanzhu, what are you doing in the peasant association? When the Central Army comes, you will be the first one to die. It's better to follow Yang Jinkai (who used to be a stubborn county magistrate), and you can still benefit from it in the future! Later, although I joined the peasant association, I still had some concerns in my heart." Yin Fuquan said: "When I participated in the struggle against the local bully Han Qianlei, firstly, he was my neighbor, and I was embarrassed; secondly, I was afraid that after the Eighth Route Army left, he would make trouble for me; therefore, I did not mention that he fined me a thousand yuan and sent me to the 'Hongbu'." Xu Wende, chairman of the peasant association, said: "I don't think Lao Jiang is capable, and there will be no political change, but he has American help, good weapons, and many people, so there may still be political change." The leaders immediately raised the questions: "Are you afraid of those people's revenge?" "How can we prevent them from retaliating?" "Even if the Central Army comes, are you afraid of American weapons?" In the heated discussion, the masses listed one by one the KMT secret agents, traitors, and local bullies who wanted to retaliate in the village, and discussed that the masses should unite to completely overthrow them, and there would be no political change. The masses said: "If we plug Lao Jiang's ears and dig out Lao Jiang's eyes, even if he comes, he will become deaf and blind." "His soldiers are all captured, and it's useless even if they have American weapons. Wasn't the 'World's First Army' annihilated?" Finally, everyone clarified the understanding that "if we overthrow the feudal forces, we will not be afraid of political change." Then, when discussing how to overthrow the feudal forces, the chairman of the peasant association said: "I felt sorry for the landlord after the liquidation!" Qin Hai said: "I felt uncomfortable when struggling against Song Baoying." In response to these ideas, the masses raised the question: "In the past, Song Baoying sent flower girls to the enemy, scaring the women to sleep in the wild for forty or fifty days. Is that uncomfortable?" "In the famine year, the traitor Wang Guoxi forced us to keep the grain, starving the old woman's daughter-in-law to death in the east, and even hanged her, scaring her to pee in her pants. Is that 'pitiable'?" The masses, one after another, even the most silent peasants, told many facts about the crimes of traitors and bullies. After ideological examination, the backward peasants and silent peasants in the village have actively risen up and are launching a thorough struggle.

　　郭村注意思想教育
    路村打破变天顾虑
    【本报太岳二十日电】屯留郭村干部与积极分子挨门按户检查群众翻身情况后，发现全村尚有三十八户没有翻透身，急需进行填平补齐。但三十八户中，部分人系思想有顾虑，“顾情面”，在大家翻身运动中，未得到果实或得的很少，所以有些积极分子便提出：“这些人太美了，不惹人，还要翻身，吃现成的。”有的更主张把村公所存的房子、土地、粮食贱卖给他们，明年打下粮食再说。经过三天的酝酿与讨论，最后大家说：“咱们先翻身是觉悟的早，他们没翻身是觉悟的迟，觉悟早应帮助落后农民翻身，天下农民是一家，大家都要翻身。”积极分子更提出：“我们不仅帮助这些人得到一点果实翻了身，还要长期教育他，打通脑筋，不然他们以为得到土地、房屋是送人情的。”这意见得到全村农民的拥护，农会主席很明确的向大家宣布：“咱们农民不光在财产上翻身，还要在政治上翻身，这样才能把封建势力扫光。”现正在最后扫清封建势力。
    【本报讯】据屯留县农会报导：路村最近在群运中发现并解决了落后群众怕变天及可怜地主恶霸思想，群众觉悟提高，运动获大进展。在思想检查中，农会副主席霍庆孩说：“刘拴柱介绍我参加农会时，我说：拴柱，你在农会搞啥事，中央军来了你头一个不得活，不如跟着人家杨近凯（过去当过顽县长），将来还能沾点光！后来我虽说进了农会，心里总还有些顾虑。”尹福全说：“我参加斗争恶霸韩千磊时，一来和他是邻居，不好意思，二来怕八路军走了，他和咱过不去；所以他罚过我一千块钱，又把我送给‘洪部’的事都没有提。”农会主席徐文德说：“我觉得老蒋不顶事，变不了天，可是他有美国帮助，武器好，人又多，还是可能变天。”领导上当即提出：“怕那些人报复呢？”“怎样使他们不能报复呢？”“就是中央军来了，有美国武器怕不怕呢？”在热烈的讨论中，群众一一举出了村里想报复的蒋特、汉奸、恶霸地主，又讨论出群众全体一齐起来把他们彻底斗倒天就变不了。群众说：“塞住老蒋的耳朵，挖了老蒋的眼，就是他来了，也变成了聋子和瞎子。”“他的兵都是抓来的，拿上美国武器也不顶事，‘天下第一军’不是都消灭了吧！”最后大家都明确了“把封建势力打垮就不怕变天”的认识。接着在讨论如何打垮封建势力时，农会主席说：“我看见地主清算后，觉得他可怜！”秦孩说：“斗争宋保英时我觉得难受。”针对这些思想，群众提出：“从前宋保英给敌人送花姑娘，吓的妇女们在野地睡了四五十天，难受不难受？”“灾荒年，汉奸王国玺逼着要保管粮，把东头老婆儿媳饿死了，还把她吊了一顿，吓的她屙到裤子里，“可怜不可怜”？！群众你一言我一语，平常最不吭气的农民都说出了许多奸霸的罪恶事实。经过思想检讨，该村落后农民，不吭气农民都已积极起来，正展开彻底斗争。
