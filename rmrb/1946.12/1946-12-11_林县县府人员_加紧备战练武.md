    Lin County Government Personnel
    Intensify Combat Readiness Training
    [Our newspaper's Changzhi dispatch on the 9th] All cadres and staff of the Lin County government, since the latter part of last month, have been using their spare time to launch a heated combat readiness training movement, preparing to strike a blow against the Chiang troops who dare to invade Lin County again. They have now generally learned various mine-laying methods such as "double separate stick," "single separate stick," "stone pressure mine," "pressure line mine," "scissor step mine," and "knock-down mine." The morale is extremely high. Guard Xiao Bazai said: "Prepare dry rations for Chiang Kai-shek and wait for him to come and eat a big one, and make him sleep upside down." At the beginning, the farthest throwing distance of grenades did not exceed 30 meters, but now it has generally reached more than 35 meters. Comrade Fu Qianku has achieved a new record of 45 meters in grenade throwing. In the sound of "Learn from Comrade Fu Qianku," the combat readiness competition in the unit is developing in full swing.

    林县县府人员
    加紧备战练武
    【本报长治九日电】林县县政府全体干部杂务人员，自上月下旬起，利用工作空隙，展开热烈的练武运动，准备予胆敢再次进犯林县的蒋军以打击。现已普遍学会“双别棍”，“单别棍”，“石压雷”，“压线雷”，“剪踏雷”，“打倒雷”等多种埋雷方法。情绪至为昂扬，警卫员小八仔说：“给蒋介石准备好干粮，等他来吃一家伙，管叫他四脚朝天睡大觉”。投弹开始最远超不过三十米达，现已普遍投到三十五米达以上，傅千库同志投弹已达四十五米达的新纪录。在“向傅千库同志看齐”的号声中，该部的练武竞赛正热火朝天地开展着。
