　　Qingfeng First District Stretcher Team
    Continues to Help the Masses Even After Participating in Two Consecutive Campaigns
    [Our Newspaper Reporter Team, 9th] The Qingfeng First District Stretcher Team, which participated in the Juncheng and Huaxian battles, actively helped the masses with their work during breaks from combat missions. While resting in Wumingtun, Puyang, the second detachment helped the masses dig more than ten mu of sweet potatoes in three days. Those with skills helped the masses make small carts, large cart axles, tables, chairs and benches, build houses, and carry water, push manure, carry grain, etc. Because they helped the masses, the masses treated them like family, lending them clothes when they were cold and boiling water when they were thirsty. They helped Ren Xueren build a house, refusing food or money. Xueren personally presented a basket of sweet potatoes, saying, "You must try these, even if you don't eat them." When the son of the landlord, Old Man Zhang, left with a cart, leaving no one to do the work at home, the team helped him harvest four mu of sweet potatoes and even dug a cellar for him, going down into the cellar. Old Man Zhang said with emotion, "You are really good people, doing all the work." When they set off, they checked discipline in each courtyard, and all the villagers came out to see them off. Ren Changshun said affectionately, "Next time, no matter what you are doing, if you pass through our village again, just come to our house as if you were visiting relatives and sit for a while." The stretcher bearers were all very moved, saying, "The folks in this village are really good." The stretcher team has a good relationship with the masses. There are two reasons: First, the cadres lead, educate, supervise, and inspect, and the Party members act as the backbone, thus inspiring everyone's consciousness; second, timely education is carried out to promote righteousness, so no one lags behind, and there is no desertion or violation of mass discipline.

　　清丰一区担架队
    连续参加两次战役仍抽空帮群众做活
    【本报记者团九日电】参加鄄城、滑县之战的清丰一区担架队，在完成战斗任务的空隙中，积极帮助群众做活。在濮阳五明屯休息时，二分队三天就帮助群众刨了十来亩红薯。会手艺的人帮群众打小车子、做大车轴、打桌椅凳，盖房子，并担水、推粪、背粮食等……。因为他们帮助群众，所以群众对他们就像自家人一样，冷了借衣服，渴了烧汤水。他们帮任学仁盖房子，不吃饭也不要钱，学仁亲手捧着一篮子红薯送来说：“你们不吃也得尝一尝。”房东张老头儿子推车走了，家里活没人干，该队便帮他把红薯四亩收回来，还替他挖了地窖，下到窖里。张老头感动的说：“你们真是好人，把什么活都给做了。”他们出发时，到各院检查纪律，全村群众都出来欢送，任常顺亲热的说：“下回不管干啥，再从俺庄过，只当是看亲戚，也得到俺家坐坐。”担架员都很感动的说：“这庄老乡真好。”担架队与群众关系搞得好。原因有二：第一是干部领导教育督促检查，党员做了骨干，因此启发了大家自觉；第二及时教育，发扬正气，因此谁也不落后，更没有开小差和违犯群众纪律的。（小吴）
