Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 23rd: The "Sino-American Aviation Agreement," by which the Chiang government comprehensively sells out China's airspace rights, was formally signed on the 20th of this month. Inspection flights are about to begin. According to a news release from the US Information Service in Nanjing: The official text of the treaty is even more extensive than the draft signed on the 30th of last month. Among them, American aircraft companies can enjoy transit rights or non-traffic stops within Chinese territory. "In addition to the specified locations of Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, etc., American aircraft can also load and unload passengers, cargo, and mail at locations agreed upon at any time in the future." Transit rights are another commercial right obtained by the United States in China. The "right to non-traffic stops" means that the right to land aircraft for military needs other than commercial purposes is also included.

    蒋美签订航空协定
    【新华社延安二十三日电】蒋政府全面出卖中国领空权的《中美航空协定》，已于本月二十日正式签定。视察性之飞行，即将开始。据南京美新闻处消息：该条约正式条文较上月卅日签定之草案内容尤为广泛，其中有美国飞机公司得在中国领土内享受转运权或非交通之停靠，“美机除在已规定之上海、天津、广州等地点外，并可在以后随时同意之地点载卸乘客、货物与邮件”等新规定。转运权为美国在中国获得之又一商业权利。而“非交通之停靠权”，即意味着商业性以外，作为军事须要的飞机降落权亦包括在内。
