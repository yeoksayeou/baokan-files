　　Ji-Lu-Yu Frontline Army and People
  　Hold Joint Celebration and Birthday Congratulation Meeting
  　General Liu Bocheng Calls on All Commanders and Fighters to Learn from Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Spirit of Hard Struggle and Eliminate More Enemies.
    [Report from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Frontline of this newspaper on the 30th] Today is the 60th birthday of Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the People's Liberation Army. After the Ji-Lu-Yu Frontline field army annihilated 12,000 invading troops of Chiang Kai-shek in Hua County, they triumphantly returned and held celebration meetings in their garrisons, paying tribute to Commander-in-Chief Zhu from afar. General Liu Bocheng, the Frontline Headquarters, and directly subordinate units also held a military-civilian get-together this afternoon at 4 p.m., along with an exhibition of war trophies captured since the start of the Longhai Patriotic Self-Defense Counter-Attack War, as well as cartoons and photos of important battles. In the open-air exhibition ground, the visiting masses saw the tanks and artillery captured by the Eighth Route Army on the Longhai Line, photos of the Eighth Route Army soldiers fighting bravely, capturing Chiang's army commander Zhao Xitian, brigade commander Liu Guangxin, and the facts of rape and looting by Chiang's army. An old lady said: "The Central Army is even worse than the puppet troops!" The stories of the Eighth Route Army fighting while helping the masses with the autumn harvest and sacrificing blood to protect the lives and property of the people made the celebration of Commander-in-Chief Zhu's birthday even more intimate. A group of old ladies listened to the Eighth Route Army soldiers explaining the stories of fighting, capturing prisoners, and seizing guns in the cartoons, and they were all smiles. Although it is now severe winter here, and the weather is freezing, the visitors were all in high spirits. At 6 p.m., a military-civilian celebration meeting was held. General Liu Bocheng delivered a congratulatory speech, calling on all commanders and fighters to learn from Commander-in-Chief Zhu's spirit of enduring hardship, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming difficulties, and being full of vigor, to eliminate the enemy's second, third, and twenty-fifth brigades as a gift to celebrate the 60th birthday of the Commander-in-Chief. General Liu Bocheng particularly emphasized: "Commander-in-Chief Zhu has gone through five eras: the Revolution of 1911, the Great Revolution, the Agrarian Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the current Patriotic Self-Defense War. Commander-in-Chief Zhu has always stood on the front lines, and has always used weak armed forces to defeat powerful reactionary armed forces. Commander-in-Chief Zhu has dedicated his life to the revolution and the liberation of the people. The more difficult the situation, the more cautious and vigorous he is. The Commander-in-Chief is as broad as the sea. Seeing him is like seeing the warmth of spring. We must unite, and take unity as a practical action to celebrate the Commander-in-Chief's birthday." Finally, an entertainment gathering was held.

    【本报晋冀鲁豫前线卅日电】今日为人民解放军朱总司令六十寿辰，冀鲁豫前线各野战兵团于滑县消灭蒋介石进犯军一万二千人后，胜利凯旋归来，纷纷在驻地举行庆祝大会，遥向朱总司令致敬。刘伯承将军、前线指挥部、直属队亦于今日午后四时举行军民联欢晚会，并举行自陇海爱国自卫反击战开始以来历次缴获之战利品及各重要战役的漫画、相片等展览。在露天展览场上，参观群众看到了陇海线八路军缴获的坦克及大炮，八路军将士的英勇战斗，活捉蒋军师长赵锡田、旅长刘广信等的照片及蒋军奸淫抢掠的事实。一个老太太说：“中央军真比皇协军还孬呀！”八路军一边作战，一边帮助群众秋收，为保卫老百姓的生命财产而牺牲流血的故事，对庆祝朱总司令的寿辰更加感到亲切。一群老太太听着八路军战士向她解释漫画上打仗捉俘虏缴枪的故事，乐得眉开眼笑。此间已届严冬，天寒地冻，但参观者无不精神百倍。晚六时举行军民庆祝大会，刘伯承将军亲致祝词，号召全体指战员学习朱总司令不辞劳苦、不怕牺牲、克服困难、朝气勃勃的精神，以消灭敌人第二个、第三个、二十五个旅的有生力量，作为庆祝总司令六十大寿的礼物。刘伯承将军特别着重的指出：“朱总司令经过了辛亥革命、大革命、土地革命、抗日战争及现在的爱国自卫战争五个时代，朱总司令回回都是站在最前线，而且都以弱小武装打倒了强大的反动武装。朱总司令以毕生精力奉献于革命于人民的解放事业，越到困难时候，越小心谨慎，越有朝气。总司令，量大如海，见到他就像见到了春天一样的温暖。我们要团结，以团结作为庆祝总司令的实际行动”。最后并举行娱乐冀会。
