　　Yuncheng Third District Militia Repels Over 700 Chiang Kai-shek Troops and Puppets
    Illegal Chiang Regime Between Heze and Dongming Repents and Surrenders to Democratic Government
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 24th dispatch] The Yuncheng Third District militia repelled over 700 Chiang Kai-shek troops and "Homecoming Corps" who were attempting to loot grain. When our army recovered Yuncheng, the "Homecoming Corps" fled in disarray with Chiang's troops to Juye. The Juye Chiang army and puppet regime did not supply the corps with provisions, and their living conditions were very difficult. On the morning of the 10th, over 200 members of the corps went to Zhanglou and Hecang in the Yuncheng Third District to loot grain. Upon hearing the news, our Third District militia rushed to the scene and engaged the enemy at Hecang. They bravely charged and ultimately routed the corps, pursuing them victoriously for over ten li to Wangguantun. Chiang's army dispatched over 500 troops from Shatuji to reinforce the corps. Our Juye local armed forces also arrived upon hearing the news and fought from morning until 2 PM, repelling the enemy, killing and wounding seven members of the "Homecoming Corps," and recovering the grain to distribute to the masses.
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu Frontline, 24th dispatch] After our great victory in Hua County, the illegal Chiang regime and "Homecoming Corps" between Heze and Dongming repented and surrendered to the democratic government one after another. Our democratic government has granted them lenient treatment and allowed them to start anew. The democratic order in the area is gradually being restored, and the democratic government is working to eliminate the remaining forces of American imperialist economic aggression and build a market for handicrafts and national industries.
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 23rd dispatch] The Ju-He Guerrilla Detachment, in carrying out guerrilla warfare, has mobilized the masses to conduct anti-"counter-settlement" struggles. Chiang's Fifth Army used puppet bandits and traitors to organize "Special Agent Teams" and "Counter-Settlement Teams," forcing the masses to join the Red Spear Society, demanding eight jin of wheat per mu per instance, and fifty soldiers per district. The masses throughout the county could not bear this kind of oppression, and over a thousand militiamen, village cadres, and activists organized the Ju-He Guerrilla Detachment. Everyone gritted their teeth and said: "They kill us, we kill them!" In just one week, there were eleven battles, large and small, killing three enemy puppets, wounding five, capturing eighteen, and seizing two rifles and two carts. Wherever the detachment went, they established a democratic government and returned all the fruits that the landlords had seized back to the masses. Li Zhuangxue, head of the Jia Li Chang village "Homecoming Corps," returned eighteen sacks of miscellaneous grain and a barn of sorghum that had been seized from military families. Landlord Guo Chengxian returned all ten mu of peanut fields and all the fruits of the struggle that had been seized, and admitted his mistakes to the masses.
