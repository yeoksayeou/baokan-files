[Urgent Telegram from Taiyue, November 30th, 12:00] In response to defending Yan'an and defending Chairman Mao, the Eighth Route Army on the southern front of this region took the initiative to attack. First, it completely annihilated more than 80 members of Chiang Kai-shek's special agent bandit gang Chen Lide's unit stationed at the Dongjiang Village stronghold, 30 li southeast of Jiyuan City in the northern Henan region along the Yellow River. Another unit of our army, taking advantage of the victory, attacked Jiyuan City from the southwest, and the 3rd Battalion of the 164th Regiment of the 55th Brigade of Chiang's army stationed in the city was terrified and fled to Miaodian Village, 20 li east of the city. Our army then formed a encirclement. The next night (29th), when the Chiang's army sent a detachment back to the city to scout, we launched a general offensive and annihilated the Chiang's army detachment. Jiyuan City was thus recovered. The connection between Chiang's troops in northern Henan and southern Shanxi was therefore broken. Detailed battle results are still being investigated.

    【本报太岳十一月三十日十二时急电】为响应保卫延安，保卫毛主席，本区南线八路军主动出击，首将黄河沿豫北地区济源城东南三十里东蒋村据点蒋记特务惯匪陈立德部八十余人全部歼灭；另一路我军并乘胜由西南攻入济源城内，占驻城内之蒋军五十五旅一六四团三营惊慌万分，窜逃至城东二十里之庙店村，我军乃形成包围圈，待次日（二十九）夜该股蒋军派一部兵力回城侦察时，发动总攻，当即将该股蒋军悉数歼灭，济源城乃告光复。豫北晋南蒋军联系因此突破。详细战果正清查中。
