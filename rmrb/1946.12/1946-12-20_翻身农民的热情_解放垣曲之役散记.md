The battle to recover Yuanqu County tested Luotuo Kiln, a small mountain village with only twenty-four households, and it also tested the peasants of Luotuo Kiln who had been allocated land. They knew who the war was for and who they should follow. They participated in war support work with great enthusiasm. Poor peasant Wang Caizan (this should be the old term), who is now a middle peasant with twelve mu of land allocated to his family of three, received 58 jin of wheat from the government in two days and had to grind it into flour within one day to be delivered to the Zhujiagou supply station the next morning. During the day on the second, his wife carefully picked out the sand from the wheat. At night, the couple started grinding flour on the stone mill by the door. The oxen here are not accustomed to pushing the mill, so they had to use manpower. The stone mill was large and heavy. The husband pulled in front and the wife pushed from behind until midnight, but they had not yet ground even half of it. Wang Caizan became anxious and complained that his wife was moving too slowly: "If the flour isn't delivered by dawn, what will the army eat? You have to know that the Eighth Route Army is fighting for us!" His wife didn't argue but just pushed harder. In such a moonlit night, all that could be heard in the village was the sound of the mill and footsteps. The severe cold of the deep winter dawn permeated the earth. Wang Caizan sat in front of the wooden box, sifting the last basket of flour. His wife started a large fire of wheat stalks to keep him warm. In the warm firelight, his wrinkled face was full of smiles. Early in the morning, Wang Caizan was the first to carry two bags of flour to the station. Lame Guo Quanxi was an old tenant farmer. After the liberation, he had twelve mu of land. He told his family, "Liberation depends on the Eighth Route Army! We can't let the army suffer." Although he was lame, he still participated in the heavy work of chopping firewood on the mountain. At this time, the whole family mobilized. His wife looked after the children and cooked, his mother ground flour, and his younger brother Guo Laixi went to do odd jobs. In five days, his mother ground sixty jin of flour and husked eighty jin of rice. The task assigned to Luotuo Kiln by the village office was very heavy, but the village head Wang Gaowen accepted it readily. He just thought about "how to complete it." When he returned to the village to hold a mass meeting, activist Wang Jinren proposed: "We can only guarantee the completion of the task by organizing ourselves." All forty-five able-bodied and semi-able-bodied people in the village organized five mutual aid teams to support the front lines. The task of chopping firewood, husking rice, and grinding flour for seven days was completed in five days. During these five days, people rested but the mill didn't rest, the donkey rested but the rice huller didn't rest. They were preparing everything for the liberation of Yuanqu with full intensity day and night. Wang Jinren got up at the third crow of the rooster every day to go to the mill to check on the rice hulling, and he always exceeded the original plan. He would always say with a smile, "Good, good!" and then go to another place. The liberated peasants can withstand the test of war. They work with unprecedented joy to ensure the supply of the front lines and strive for victory on the front lines. When the village head of Yuangongzi, with his eyes red from not sleeping for five nights, lay down on the wheat straw to rest, peasants Guo Nuoyan and Li Zunju—two old men in the village—came to him to discuss electing Wang Jinren as a hero in support of the front lines and asked him to report his merits to the county.

　　翻身农民的热情
    解放垣曲之役散记
    收复垣曲城的战役，考验了骆驼窑——这座仅有二十四户的小山庄，同样也考验了分得土地的骆驼窑的农民。他们知道战争是为了谁，应跟谁走。他们用高度的热情，参加战勤工作。贫农王财三（这应当是过去的称呼），今年已是全家三口人分得十二亩耕地的中农，他家在二日领到政府五十八斤小麦，在一天时间内要磨成面，明天的早晨要送到朱家沟的供应站上去。二日的白天，他的妻子很细心的把麦中的砂子拣净淘出来，天黑夫妇两人在门边的石磨上推起面来。这里的牛是不习惯推磨的，只得用人力，石磨又大又重，夫前妇后推到半夜，尚未推到一半，王财三就发急了，埋怨妻子走得太慢：“天明不交面，你叫军队拿什吃，你要知道八路军是为了咱呀！”妻子听了并未分辩什么，只是更用力推着走着，在这样月白风清的夜晚，全村只听得到磨声和足声。深冬拂晓的严寒浸蚀了大地，王财三坐在木箱前已是箩着最后一箩面，妻子在旁烧起大堆麦，为他驱寒，温暖的火光里，他带有皱纹的脸上饱存着笑容。清早，王财三争取第一个扛着两袋面交到了站上。跛子郭全喜是个老佃户，翻身以后有十二亩耕地，他告家里人说：“翻身要靠八路军呀！不能叫军队受罪。他虽然跛着足，还是参加了上山砍柴的繁重工作，这时候，全家动员起来，妻子看小孩、做饭，母亲磨面，弟弟郭来喜去支差，在五天中他母亲磨了六十斤面，碾了八十斤米。村公所分配给骆驼窑的任务很繁重，闾长王高文接受的却很痛快，他只是想“怎样去完成”，当回到闾下开群众会议时，积极分子王近仁提出：“组织起来才能保证完成任务。”全村四十五个全半劳力，便组织了五个支援前线互助组，打柴、碾米、磨面七天的任务五天就完成了。在这五天中，真是人歇磨不歇，驴歇碾不歇，整天整夜紧张准备解放垣曲战役的一切供应，王近仁每天鸡唱三遍就起床到磨上碾上去检查，去的时候都已超过了原定的计划，他总是张着笑嘴说：“好，好！”又转到另一处去了。翻身的农民经得起战争考验，他们是以从来未有过的愉快来劳动，保证前线的供应，争取前线胜利。当辕公子的闾长红着五夜未曾睡觉的眼，轻快的躺在麦秸上休息时，农民郭诺言、李遵矩——村里的两个老头子，便来找他商量要选举王近仁为支援前线的英雄，并要求蒋他的功劳报告给县上。
