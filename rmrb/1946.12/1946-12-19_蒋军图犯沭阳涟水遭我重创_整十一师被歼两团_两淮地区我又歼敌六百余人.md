Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: In the great battle on the Suwan North Front, which stretched over 200 li, the New Fourth Army annihilated nearly two more regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. In the Suqian area: Chiang Kai-shek's 11th Division (formerly the 18th Army, Chen Cheng's old unit, now belonging to Wang Jingjiu's group), newly transferred from the Jilu豫 battlefield to attack Shuyang, was annihilated by the New Fourth Army at Zhangweizi, 50 li northeast of Suqian, on the 15th. Another of its regiments was also largely annihilated. The 60th Brigade of the 69th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, which attacked eastward from Suqian, was also killed and wounded more than 200 people in the area 40 li northeast of Suqian on the 14th. On the same day, the 41st Brigade of the 26th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, which occupied Zhangshan Town, 30 li north of Suqian, turned east to attack Liandian, and the battle between the Grand Canal and the Shuyang River is fierce. In the Lianghuai area: The remnants of the 58th Brigade of the 74th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who attacked Daihe Town, 15 li west of Lianshui, suffered a heavy blow from the New Fourth Army on the 14th. They reorganized and attacked again on the 15th, and are now in fierce battle.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th: A great battle is underway on the Suwan North Front. Chiang Kai-shek's troops concentrated more than ten regiments and launched a large-scale offensive from Lianghuai, Suqian, and other places against the Lianshui and Shuyang areas, starting on the 12th. The two regiments of the 171st Division of the 7th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, as well as the 58th Brigade of the 74th Division, the 52nd Brigade of the 28th Division, and the remnants of the ××2nd Brigade, attacked northeast towards Daihe Town, 15 li west of Lianshui, and the Shunheji line, 30 li south of Lianshui. Fierce artillery battles raged all day on the 14th. The New Fourth Army on this line has killed and captured more than 600 Chiang Kai-shek's troops. The Pre-3rd Brigade of the 57th Division, the 41st Brigade of the 26th Division, and the 60th Brigade of the 69th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops have invaded Zhangshan Town in Suqian and Shaodian, 45 li northeast of Suqian. The New Fourth Army is fighting valiantly in self-defense and is currently engaged in intense artillery battles.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th: The Huang Yu guerrilla team, active in the suburbs of Huaiyin and famous in Huaihai, killed and captured a total of 61 Chiang Kai-shek troops and "Homecoming Corps" members in October and November. They repeatedly sabotaged the Huai (yin) Shu (yang) highway, and the 18-li section from Wangying to Dingji has not yet been repaired. They also destroyed the Huai (yin) Si (yang) highway more than ten times, cut 125 jin of leather wire, and more than 300 jin of lead wire. Under their powerful deterrent, the Chiang Kai-shek-appointed township chiefs went to the countryside during the day to "work" and slipped back to their strongholds at night, known as "flying chiefs." But they did not fly for long before they were captured alive by the guerrilla team active in the suburbs of Lianghuai. Last month, on the 22nd, Zhou Erhu, a Huaihai militia hero, led the militia to cooperate with the main force in counterattacking Songji, capturing 52 "Homecoming Corps" members in one fell swoop, seizing one heavy machine gun and twelve rifles. In the Antidian area southeast of Huaian, Sun Zhong, the assistant district chief of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and 40 township chiefs in the entire district, were successively killed, and more than 20 others were captured alive. More than 20 members of the Doutang "Homecoming Corps" were also captured alive. In addition, the Guanyun militia directly attacked near Heiqiao at the south gate of Guanyun last month on the 12th, arresting three bad guys, which greatly shocked the Chiang Kai-shek puppets.
