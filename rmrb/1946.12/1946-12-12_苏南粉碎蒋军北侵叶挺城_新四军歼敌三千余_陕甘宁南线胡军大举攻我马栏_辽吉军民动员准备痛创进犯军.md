Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 9th: The New Fourth Army on the Su-Wan Southern Front, from the 6th to the 8th noon, killed and captured over 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops invading Ye Ting City (i.e., Yancheng), the spoils of war are being inventoried. Currently, the 83rd and 65th Divisions of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which are attacking Yancheng from a front 30 li south of Wu*, have been cut into several sections by the New Fourth Army and surrounded. A detachment of Chiang Kai-shek troops that fled to Liujiakan, 8 li east of Wu*, has been annihilated. The New Fourth Army is now compressing towards Biancang, 15 li south of Wu*, and a portion of the main force has detoured to Liuzhuang, south of Biancang, to cut off their retreat. The invading Chiang Kai-shek troops, numbering eleven regiments, including the 19th Brigade of the 83rd Division (formerly the 100th Army), the 160th Brigade and 187th Brigade of the 65th Division (formerly the Army), and the 108th Brigade of the 25th Division (formerly the Army), began their northward invasion from Dongtai, Xinghua, and Linze Town (northwest of Xinghua) in four routes on the 26th of last month, under the cover of five American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, attempting to seize Ye Ting City in one fell swoop.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 9th: As of November 20th, the local armed forces of Rudong (formerly eastern Rugao in the New County) on the Su-Wan Southern Front had averaged more than one battle per day for four months, capturing 1,290 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers alive, killing or wounding another 215, seizing × rocket launchers, 20 machine guns, 55 Thompson and Bren guns, 78 rifles and carbines, over 20,000 rounds of ammunition, destroying 15 li of circuits, and recovering eight important towns and villages, including Matang. In addition, the local armed forces and militia of Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, and other counties killed or wounded 500 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers below the rank of company commander and captured 110 alive in October and November, seizing 5 machine guns, 4 grenade launchers, over 80 rifles and carbines, intercepting 60 grain ships, and recovering 12 villages and towns, including Liubao in Baoying, Cha'an in Gaoyou, and Dongxi Gaozhuang in Xinghua. They also once captured Ershilipu on the Gao (you)-Shao (bo) line. Now that the rear of the Chiang Kai-shek army is empty after their northern invasion of Yancheng, the local armed forces of various counties are cooperating with the main force on the front to widely carry out guerrilla warfare.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Chiang Kai-shek's Hu Zongnan's troops, with five or six regiments, launched a large-scale attack on the Guanzhong Sub-region of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in multiple routes, invading over 30 li into the Border Region and occupying our important commercial town of Liulin Town and Yangjiadianzi (Liulin is 70 li south of Malan City, the location of the Guanzhong Special Office, and Yangjiadian is 40 li east of Malan City). On the south side of Malan, the 367th Regiment and 368th Regiment of the enemy's 123rd Brigade, the 143rd Regiment of the 48th Brigade, and the 3rd Regiment of the Shaanxi Security Force, after converging on our Wenwang Mountain from Tongguan and Yaoxian, occupied our Liulin on the 8th and are now advancing towards Miaowan Town, the location of the Yaoxian County government. On the east side of Chunyao, two battalions of the 367th Regiment of the enemy's 123rd Brigade and a portion of the 495th Regiment of the 165th Brigade occupied our Yangjiadianzi on the 6th from Huanping Town in Yijun, attempting to outflank Malan from the northeast. This battle is personally commanded by Liu Ziqi, the brigade commander of the 123rd Brigade.

Wherever Hu Zongnan's troops went, they looted wildly. In Xiguzhuang, Yaoqu Town, near Wenwang Mountain alone, they dragged away over 30 of our people, over 200 head of livestock, and burned over 20 shi of grain.

In the past month, Hu Zongnan's troops have launched continuous attacks on our Guanzhong, reaching fifteen or sixteen times, all of which were repelled by our military and civilians. In November alone, we annihilated and captured over 500 people. The militia bravely participated in the war and captured over 300 enemy soldiers, destroying more than one-fifth of the enemy's blockhouses sealing off Guanzhong. This large-scale offensive by Hu Zongnan's troops will definitely be resolutely annihilated by our Guanzhong military and civilians.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th: According to reports from the Liaoning-Jilin front, Chiang Kai-shek's troops, with six divisions, launched an attack on our Liaoning-Jilin area in three routes from the 26th of last month to the 5th of this month. One route, the 88th and 87th Divisions of the 71st Army, successively occupied Changling, Baokang, and other places. The second route, the 38th and 50th Divisions of the New 1st Army, attacked westward from Nong'an, successively occupying Halahai Fu, Longquan, and other places. The third route, the 22nd Division of the New 6th Army and the 21st Division of the 60th Army, attacked northward from Huaide, successively occupying Shunshan Fort and other places. Now, the military and civilians of Liaoning and Jilin have been urgently mobilized, preparing to inflict severe blows on the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops.
