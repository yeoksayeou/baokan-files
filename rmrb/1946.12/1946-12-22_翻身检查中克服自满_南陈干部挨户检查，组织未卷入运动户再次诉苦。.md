　　【Report from Taiyue, 17th of this month】In Qin County's South Chen Village, after conducting an in-depth review of rent reduction, ideological concerns of middle peasants and those associated with puppet regimes were resolved, enabling the movement to continue to develop. South Chen Village is one of the ten key points in the county for mobilizing the masses. After four months of work, and several major struggles against traitors, despots, rent reduction and debt clearing, major traitors and despotic landlords have basically collapsed. The basic masses have largely obtained the fruits of the struggle, so cadres and activists felt "almost" satisfied. However, after a major review of land reform, out of 188 households in the village, 127 participated in the struggle. Apart from 20 households with issues related to the struggle, 41 households had not participated, including 19 middle-peasant households, 17 small puppet-regime related households, and six poor tenant-peasant households. The leadership then induced the masses to discuss, "Who are the targets of the struggle?" Subsequently, meetings were held separately for tenant farmers, middle peasants, small puppet-regime related people, and households protecting the property of despots. At the tenant farmer meeting, Yang Donglai, who had previously refrained from participating in the struggle due to personal relationships, was the first to speak: "I only have two fen of land now, and life is unbearable. The root of this poverty is embedded in Yang Tonghao, and it must be pulled out." This inspired tenant farmers who had not yet turned over or had not fully turned over to voice their grievances one after another, correcting the cadres' "almost" mentality. The middle peasant meeting was the most successful. Middle peasants who never spoke before also voiced their grievances at this time. Li Ertang said, "I initially participated in the struggle meeting, but later when forming groups, no one paid attention to me. I thought people disliked me for being a middle peasant, so I withdrew." Li Tongyi, a village head, said very aggrievedly: "During the summer grain collection, I went to the farmers' association, and everyone was discussing the struggle. They said to me: 'This is not related to your political power, quickly collect your grain!' I went to the village office and saw that more than a dozen people were all middle peasants, which completely discouraged me." All seventeen small puppet-regime related households attended the meeting. These people originally wanted to participate in the struggle, but were afraid that the farmers' association would not want them. Now that they were summoned, they sincerely poured out their hearts. At the beginning of the movement, these people had hidden some property for the traitors and despots, so they adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the struggle. At this meeting, everyone confessed frankly. Cao Cunren revealed that he had hidden ten mu of land for the despot Cai Yaowu, and now he handed it over to the farmers' association in full. Subsequently, Jiang Sanxiao, Jiang Dianhe, and others handed over the land and grain hidden for the landlords and despots. After continuing to hold the four types of meetings, 19 middle-peasant households, six poor-peasant households, and some small puppet-regime related households all joined the farmers' association. Finally, 280 mu of land left in the village as grain-quota land, communal land, clan land, traitor land, and falsely mortgaged land were cleared and distributed in a leveling and replenishment process.

　　翻身检查中克服自满
    南陈干部挨户检查，组织未卷入运动户再次诉苦。
    【本报太岳十七日电】沁县南陈村深入查减后，解决了中农和伪军等思想顾虑，使运动继续发展，南陈村是全县发动群众十大基点之一，已经有四个月的工作，有过多次较大的反奸霸与减租清债斗争，大汉奸与恶霸地主基本上垮台了，基本群众大部得到了斗争果实，因之干部与积极分子认为“差不多”满足了。但经翻身大检查后，全村一百八十八户中，参加斗争者一百廿七户，除廿户有斗争问题外，尚有四十一户未参加斗争，其中有十九户中农，十七户小伪属，六户贫佃农，领导上随即诱导群众讨论，“谁是斗争对象”？接着分别召开佃户、中农、小伪属及包庇恶霸财产户会议，佃户会议上曾碍于情面未参加斗争的杨东来，首先发言：“我现在只有二分地，时光过不去，这穷根是扎在杨同好身上，非拔出来不可。”启发了未翻身及未翻透身的佃户接二连三的诉起苦来，纠正了干部的“差不多”思想。中农会议最成功，从来不说话的中农，此时亦诉起苦来，李二堂说：“我开始也参加斗争大会，但后来编组时没人理我，我想人家嫌我是中农，我就退出来了。”李同义是个闾长，他十分委屈地说：“夏屯时，我去农会，大家正在讨论斗争，他们对我说：‘这不关你政权上的事，快屯你的粮去吧！’我到村公所，看见十几个人都是中农，这一下把我凉透了。”小伪属会议十七户全到了，这些人原也想参加斗争，恐怕农会不要，此时既然召集他们，便真心实意的倒尽心里的话。在运动开始时，这些人曾给奸霸隐藏过部分财产，因此对斗争采取观望态度，此次会议上大家都坦白的检讨出来。曹存仁说出他给恶霸蔡耀武隐藏十亩地，现在如数交给农会。接着蒋三小、蒋典和等都将为地主恶霸所隐藏的土地粮食交出来，经继续召开的四种会议后，十九户中农，六户贫农及部分小伪属皆参加了农会，最后清理了村里所留的顶粮地、社地、族地、汉奸土地、假典等地二百八十亩，进行了一次填平补齐。
