　　[Changzhi, this newspaper, 29th dispatch] Yushe decided in mid-December to arrange for winter investigation and rent reduction, proposing that the entire county should universally carry out a "cutting off the tail, filling the hole" movement to completely realize "land to the tiller." This county is an old liberated area (partially liberated in early 1944). After the rent and interest reduction movements in 1942 and 1944, especially this year's great emancipation movement, most farmers have already been emancipated. According to statistics from 82 administrative villages, farmers have recovered more than 35,000 mu of land from landlords, and the political rule of local bullies and landlords has been basically crushed. However, from the perspective of the entire county, it is still far from completely eliminating feudalism and realizing "land to the tiller." For example, according to statistics from four villages (still average villages) – Tan Village, Hebi, Bai Village, and Beiquan – the destitute and poor peasants still account for 15% of the total population, and landlords and rich peasants still rent out or pawn out more than 350 mu of land. If the land rented by farmers from landlords in other villages is included, it is more than 900 mu. Some local bullies and landlords are still attempting to "restore" their power. Based on the above situation, the county has determined that the guiding principle for this winter's investigation and rent reduction is to further politically crush feudal rule, economically sweep away feudal vestiges, implement leveling and compensation, and completely realize "land to the tiller," putting forward the slogan of "cutting off the tail, filling the hole." It will be carried out in three types of villages according to different circumstances: 1. Villages where the land problem has been basically solved, the landlords have been crushed, and the masses have been mobilized relatively fully will focus on winter production and carry out "cutting off the tail, filling the hole" during production. 2. Villages where "land to the tiller" has been initially realized, but the feudal forces have not yet been crushed, should focus on investigation and rent reduction. 3. Backward villages where the land problem has not been solved thoroughly should conduct in-depth investigations and boldly mobilize the masses. Finally, it was pointed out that the movement should start with in-depth investigation, pay close attention to the rational distribution of fruits, unite the middle peasants and ideological education, and be bold and let go in leadership style, follow the mass line, and oppose doing everything for the masses.

　　[Changzhi City, this newspaper, 29th dispatch] Comrade Wang Zongqi of the Changzhi County Party Committee called on the heroes attending the county's heroes' meeting on the 23rd to lead the masses in a universal "leveling and compensation" movement this winter to completely realize "land to the tiller." He emphasized that in the movement, it is necessary to unite the vast number of farmers, arm the farmers, and defend the interests of emancipation. Comrade Wang first stated: "Our county's 190,000 people, after a year of emancipation movement, have recovered more than 100,000 mu of land, 150,000 shi of grain, and more than 17,000 rooms from local bullies and landlords, and the lives of the vast number of farmers have been greatly improved. After emancipation, the enthusiasm for production is very high. 75,000 men and women in the county have participated in mutual aid, forming more than 2,000 mutual aid groups. The county has increased grain production by 200,000 shi. But our emancipation is not yet thorough. In some villages, the feudal forces have not yet been crushed. We must check whether every household in the village has land to cultivate." Finally, he called on everyone: "The traitor Chiang Kai-shek is now attacking Yan'an again, and he intends to seize our good times. We must unite the vast number of farmers, take up guns, help the army well, and fight the reactionaries to the end! Defend our emancipation interests, defend Yan'an! Defend Chairman Mao!"

　　榆社决于今冬贯彻土地改革
    长治决普遍实行填平补齐
    封建赤贫均未消灭距离彻底翻身尚远
    【本报长治二十九日电】榆社于本月中旬布置冬季查减，提出全县要普遍进行一次“割尾巴，填窟窿”运动，以求彻底实现耕者有其田。该县为老解放区（部分为四四年初解放），经过四二、四四两年的减租减息运动，特别是今年的大翻身运动，大部农民已经翻身。据八十二个行政村统计：农民已从地主手中收回土地三万五千余亩，恶霸地主的政治统治，基本上已被打垮。但从全县范围来说，距彻底消灭封建、实现耕者有其田尚远，如潭村、合壁、白村、北泉四个村（还是一般村）的统计：赤贫与贫农仍占总户口百分之十五，地主富农出租与典出的土地还有三百五十余亩，如连农民租佃外村地主土地计算，则在九百亩以上，一部分恶霸地主还企图“复辟”。根据以上情况，该县确定今冬查减方针为：进一步从政治上摧垮封建统治，从经济上扫清封建尾巴，实行填平补齐，彻底实现耕者有其田，提出了“割尾巴，填窟窿”的口号。并根据不同情况分三类村进行：一、土地问题已基本上解决，地主已被打垮，群众发动较充分的村，以冬季生产为中心，在生产中进行“割尾巴，填窟窿”。二、初步实现耕者有其田，但封建势力还未打垮者，要以查减为主。三、土地问题解决的还很不彻底的落后村，应是深入检查，放手发动群众。最后指出：运动要从深入检查入手，运动中要十分注意果实分配合理，团结中农与思想教育，在领导作风上要大胆放手，走群众路线，反对包办代替。（榆社联合办公室）
    【本报长治市二十九日电】长治县委王宗琪同志，二十三日在该县群英大会上号召到会英雄领导群众在今冬普遍来一次“填平补齐”运动，以求彻底实现耕者有其田；强调指出在运动中要团结广大农民，武装农民，保卫翻身利益。王同志首称：“我县十九万人民，经过一年来的翻身运动，已从恶霸地主手中收回土地十万余亩，粮食十五万石，房子一万七千余间，广大农民生活大为改善。翻身以后，生产劲头很高，全县参加互助的男女，即有七万五千余人，组成互助组二千余个，全县增产粮二十万石，但我们的身还没有翻透，有些村子封建势力还没打垮，要检查一下村子里是否家家都有了地种？”最后号召大家：“卖国蒋贼现在又在进攻延安，他打算夺取我们的好时光，我们要把广大农民团结起来，拿起枪来，好好的帮助军队，与反动派干到底！保卫我们的翻身利益，保卫延安！保卫毛主席。”（长治联合办公室）
