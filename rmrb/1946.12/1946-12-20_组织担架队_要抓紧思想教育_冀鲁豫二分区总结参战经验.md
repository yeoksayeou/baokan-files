　　Organizing Stretcher Teams
    Grasp Ideological Education Tightly
    Second Sub-district of Ji-Lu-Yu Summarizes Combat Experience
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 16th dispatch] The Second Sub-district Command summarized the stretcher work in the Hua County campaign. The stretcher organization was good in Puyang and Shouzhang Counties, and second best in Guancheng. The reasons for the good work are: (1) Ideological education was tightly grasped. Mobilization was carried out based on the masses' own past experiences, and the facts of Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country and the Kuomintang army's brutal acts of looting and slaughter were widely publicized, so that the masses' participation in the war changed from blind to conscious. In addition, the slogan was correct: "If the stretchers are carried well, Puyang County can be protected." "If the battle in Junan is won, the enemy will not dare to occupy Puyang County." This kind of concrete slogan that fits the masses' experience has a great effect, so there was no desertion of stretcher-bearers this time. In ideological education, the method of having the masses themselves deliberate and discuss, mutually enlighten and encourage, and using the role of activists was also very effective. (2) Village headquarters were established, with specific divisions of labor and responsibilities. Arrangements were made in advance for business trips, so that the masses who were supposed to go were at ease. The stipulated method was to bring three days of rations to complete the task, and the public would reimburse them. Stretcher-bearers accompanying the army were counted as two business trips. (3) Praising models was established as a way to promote work in the villages. The masses regarded completing tasks as glorious, and everyone envied going on business trips. After mobilization, a competition and challenge was conducted.

　　组织担架队
    要抓紧思想教育
    冀鲁豫二分区总结参战经验
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】二分区指挥部总结滑县战役担架工作。濮县、寿张的担架组织好，观城次之。做的好的原因是：（一）对思想教育抓的紧，从群众过去亲身经历出发进行动员，广泛宣传蒋介石卖国事实和蒋军到处抢掠屠杀的残暴行为，使群众的参战从盲目到自觉。另外口号提的正确：“担架抬的好了，就可以保护濮县”。“鄄南打了胜仗，敌人就没敢占濮县”。这种具体的切合群众经验的口号作用很大，所以这次担架没有逃亡。在思想教育上用群众自己酝酿讨论的方式，互相启发，互相鼓励，运用积极分子作用也很大。（二）建立了村指挥部，具体分工，各有专责，出差先排好，使该去的群众安心。规定的办法是自带三天给养完成任务，公家归还，随军担架算两次差。（三）把表扬模范在村里形成推动工作的办法，群众对完成任务成为光荣，大家都很羡慕出差，动员之后，就进行竞赛挑战。
