Mrs. Stilwell, wife of the former Commander of the U.S. Forces in the China-India-Burma Theater, General Joseph Stilwell, passed away in San Francisco on October 12th. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army sent a telegram of condolence on the 14th of the same month. Now, Mrs. Stilwell's reply telegram is as follows:

To General Zhu De:

I realize how much you and the Chinese people admired my husband, and I want you to know that this admiration was mutual. Long ago, he understood that your wish was to give the Chinese people a normal and happy life. At the same time, your struggle of fighting against overwhelming odds deeply impressed him. Since returning to the United States in 1944, he had never felt truly happy again. His heart was always in China; he always hoped that one day he would be able to continue his work there. That day has strangely arrived, and now his indomitable and heroic soul can finally return to China freely. Believe me, if you often think of him—then, remember his lofty ideals, his integrity, and his courage!—in this way, you will feel that he is right in front of you and will gain strength from him! My children and I are not pessimistic; his achievements make us feel extremely proud. We all hope you can believe our words, he is with you.

Your close friend, Winnifred Stilwell, December 1, 1946.

　　史迪威夫人
    电复朱总司令
    【新华社延安二十日电】前中印缅战区美军总司令史迪威将军于十月十二日病逝旧金山，中国人民解放军总司令朱德将军于同月十四日特电致唁，顷得史迪威夫人复电如下：朱德将军阁下：
    我认识到你和中国人民对于我的丈夫是如何地景仰，我很愿意使你知道这种景仰是双方互有的。很久以前，他就已了解你的心愿是在于给中国人民以一个正常幸福的生活。同时你那以寡敌众的斗争，也深深使他赞佩。自从一九四四年回国以后，他就从没有再感到真正的愉快了。他的心永远在中国；他总希望将来万一会有一天使他能够再继续自己的事业。那个日子很奇怪的到来了，现在他那百折不挠地英勇的灵魂，终于能够自由地回到了中国。相信我，如果你经常想到他的话，——那么，就怀念起他那崇高的理想、他的高洁和他的勇敢吧！——这样，你会觉得他就在你的面前。并且，会从他那里得到力量的！我和我的儿女们并不感到悲观，他的成就使我们感到莫大的骄傲。我们都希望你能相信我们的话，他是和你在一起的。
    阁下的至友温尼福来德·史迪威，一九四六年十二月一日。
