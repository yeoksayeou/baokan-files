Xinhua News Agency, Shandong Telegram: In the Shandong Liberated Area, government agencies and military units have saved over ten million yuan (at a rate of 20 legal tender yuan per yuan) in the past half-month. In the eight counties of the Binhai area, all vegetable funds and public expenses are self-sufficient for three months. Local cadres in Ju County are advocating wearing old cotton clothes. All faculty and staff of the Jianguo College transported grain and pushed coal, saving over 50,000 yuan. In Haiyang and other counties, governments at all levels do not receive firewood for heating in winter and do not burn charcoal for cooking; firewood and grass are all collected from the mountains. Various units of the Binhai Military Region are engaged in salt production, with all vegetable funds being self-sufficient. The frontline "08" unit has launched a "save one item" campaign. Each team has established a savings pact, and many commanders and fighters have donated three or more items of clothing and other goods. The machine gun company has also advocated a movement to not waste a single bullet.
