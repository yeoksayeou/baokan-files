Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 28th: Chongqing News: Twenty-one people's organizations in Chongqing jointly issued a statement on the 10th of this month, calling on the people of the whole country to resist the divisive "National Assembly." The statement denounced Chiang Kai-shek's statement on the 8th as sabotaging the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference by convening the National Assembly, and that his so-called "cease-fire order" was a "deceptive means." The twenty-one organizations are the Chongqing People's Peace Promotion Association, the Chongqing Branch of the Three People's Principles Comrades Association, the Chongqing Branch of the Democratic National Construction Association, the Chongqing Branch of the Democratic Constitutionalism Promotion Association, the Chongqing Branch of the Jiusan Society, the Chongqing Branch of the Democratic Practice Society, the Chongqing Branch of the National Association of Literature and Art Circles, the Chongqing Branch of the North China Economic Construction Association, the Chongqing Women's Federation of Chongqing, the Chongqing Branch of the Vocational Youth Society, the Democratic Youth Society, the Academic Workers Association, the Social University Alumni Association, the Poets and Musicians Association, and the Modern Drama Society, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 28th: Shanghai News on the 11th: Two major people's organizations in Shanghai—the Shanghai People's Organizations Federation and the National Peace Movement Conference—jointly issued a declaration stating: "The National Assembly convened unilaterally by the authorities is merely a re-convening of an old National Assembly that has lost its effectiveness. All its resolutions are of course invalid, and the government party must bear all past and future responsibilities."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 28th: Reuters, Nanjing, 25th: "Due to the chaos in deliberating the rules of procedure for preparatory matters in the past half month, the usefulness and validity of the 'National Assembly' has been questioned among a considerable number of 'National Assembly' representatives who have come to Nanjing to support Chiang Kai-shek's government. Many people who hoped to use the 'National Assembly' to 'improve the military and political situation' have also begun to doubt the legitimacy and representativeness of the 'National Assembly.' Some 'representatives' have privately expressed their intention to withdraw from the assembly, having realized that the 'National Assembly' is not a healing factor, but only deepens division and strengthens the civil war. Many people have realized that no solution to national problems is possible without the Communist Party. Many people have realized that the 'National Assembly' only serves as a rubber stamp, simply stamping the 'constitution' promulgated by the government."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 28th: The Chongqing Xinhua Daily on the 17th published a statement from the Chongqing Branch of the Three People's Principles Comrades Association declaring: "We firmly oppose the 'National Assembly' controlled by the fascist elements of our party (referring to the Kuomintang) who have betrayed the Premier and betrayed the people. In order to express our protest, all comrades of this association, regardless of how they were selected as National Assembly representatives, will refuse to participate in this controlled National Assembly."

　　抵制非法包办国大
  　重庆上海廿余人民团体发表声明很多伪国大代表动摇想退出会议
  　三民主义同志会渝分会国大代表拒绝出席
    【新华社延安十一月廿八日电】渝讯：重庆二十一个人民团体，曾于本月十日联合发表声明，号召全国人民抵制分裂的“国大”。该声明指斥蒋介石八日声明是破坏政协决议召开国大，其所谓“停战令”乃是“欺骗手段”。该二十一团体为重庆人民和平促进会、三民主义同志联合会渝分会、民主建国会渝分会、民主宪政促进会渝分会、九三学社渝分社、民主实践社渝分社、全国文协渝分会、华北经建协会渝分会、渝妇女联谊会、职业青年社渝分社、民主青年社、学术工作者协会、社会大学同学会、诗歌音乐工作者协会及现代戏剧学会等。
    【新华社延安十一月二十八日电】十一日沪讯：上海两大人民团体——沪市人民团体联合会及全国和平运动大会联合会联名发表宣言称：“当局单独召开的国大，只是一个已失时效的旧国民大会的重新召开。它的一切决议，当然无效，政府党得负一切过去未来的责任。”
    【新华社延安十一月二十八日电】路透社二十五日南京讯称：“由于过去半个月来审议准备事宜议事规则的混乱，‘国大’的是否有用和有效，在前来南京支持蒋介石政府的很可观的一部分‘国大’代表们中间，已发生怀疑。好些希望借‘国大’以‘改进军政局势’的人们，也已怀疑起‘国大’的合法性和代表性来，有些‘代表’在私人谈话中，已经表示要退出大会，他们已经醒悟而认为‘国大’不是一种治病的因素，却只加深分裂与加强内战。好些人已认识到没有共产党任何办法都不可能是解决全国问题的办法。好些人认识到‘国大’只有充当印信图章的作用，在政府颁布的‘宪法’上盖一个章了事”。
    【新华社延安十一月二十八日电】十七日重庆新华日报刊载三民主义同志联合会渝分会宣称：“我们坚决反对背叛总理背叛人民的本党（按指国民党）法西斯分子御用的‘国大’，为了表示我们的抗议，本会同志无论系经由何种方式产生的国大代表，均将拒绝参加此项御用的国大。”
