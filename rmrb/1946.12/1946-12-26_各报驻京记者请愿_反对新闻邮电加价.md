Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Nanjing News: Over a hundred reporters stationed in Beijing from various newspapers went to the Ministry of Transportation on the 16th and 17th to petition against the price increases for news, postage, and telecommunications, as well as restrictions on telephone usage, to the Chiang government's Minister of Transportation, Yu Dawei. They pointed out that the price increases and restrictions were tantamount to destroying the news industry, and various newspapers would inevitably be forced to close. Furthermore, after petitioning at the Ministry of Transportation on the 16th, the reporters "collectively went to the National Assembly" venue to petition the presidium and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou of the "National Assembly" regarding the assault on a reporter from the Heping Ribao (Peace Daily) by "National Assembly" representative Song Yishan. Over a hundred people surged in through the main entrance of the square, and the guarding military police were unable to stop them. The situation was tense, and the reporters demanded that Song Yishan publicly apologize to the Chiang-controlled "National Assembly" Secretary Hong Lanyou.
