    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. New York dispatch: The discussion of the troop stationing issue began in the UN General Assembly on the 8th. This issue was submitted to the General Assembly by the Political and Security Committee, which concluded its discussion of the issue on the 27th of last month. At that time, the committee voted on the British and American representatives' amendments to the original Soviet proposal. The common ground of the British and American amendments was that the scope of the investigation should include domestic and foreign troops, and the difference was that the British side advocated the establishment of a control committee to verify the reports of various countries, while the American side disagreed with this point. The meeting passed a motion with forty votes against ten votes that the scope of the investigation should include domestic and foreign troops.
    At the UN General Assembly meeting on the 8th, the British representative, Shawcross, still proposed the establishment of a control mechanism. Addressing Molotov, who was listening to his speech, and the US representative, who had previously voted against the verification system, he said, "Who has ever heard of only requiring the submission of accounts to compare with other accounts, without stipulating that the accuracy of these accounts should be verified?" The meeting lasted for five hours. Molotov rose to speak after midnight, reiterating that all member states should report their foreign troops stationed abroad to the United Nations. He said: "The stationing of foreign troops in the territory of other UN member states can be used to exert pressure on the internal affairs of the host country and affect the relations between the occupied country and its neighbors." He also reiterated his previous argument that the investigation of foreign troops should not be confused with domestic forces, and that the investigation of the latter should be carried out when the United Nations deals with the issue of disarmament. Molotov also pointed out that investigating domestic forces without including armaments is incomplete. In conclusion, Molotov asked the General Assembly to reject the proposal to investigate domestic forces in favor of the Soviet proposal.

    联合国大会
    讨论调查驻军问题
    莫洛托夫发言指出：驻外军队干涉内政
    【新华社延安十日电】纽约讯：调查驻军问题已于八日在联合国大会开始讨论，此问题系由政治安全委员会提交大会讨论者。该委员会于上月二十七日结束此问题之讨论。当时委员会上曾表决英美两国代表的对苏联原建议的修正。案英美修正案之共同点为调查范围应包括国内外军队，不同点为英方主张建立一管制委员会，查核各国报告，而美方则不同意此点。会上以四十票对十票通过调查范围包括国内外军队。
    八日联合国大会会议，英代表萧克洛斯依旧提出建立管制机关，他对着听他发言的莫洛托夫和以前投票反对查核制度的美国代表称：“有谁听说过只要求交出账目去与别的账目比较，而不规定应查核这些账目的正确性呢？”会议连续开了五个钟头，莫洛托夫在午夜过后起立发言，他重提所有会员国应将其国外驻军报告联合国。他说：“外国军队之驻在其他联合国会员国领土上能被利用来对驻在国内政施以压力，并影响被占领国与其邻国的关系。”他又重申以前的论点，即调查国外驻军不应与国内部队混淆在一起，后者之调查应在联合国处理裁军问题时进行。莫氏并指出调查国内兵力而不包括军备武器是不完全的。莫氏于结语时，要求大会为赞同苏联的建议而否决调查国内兵力的提案。
