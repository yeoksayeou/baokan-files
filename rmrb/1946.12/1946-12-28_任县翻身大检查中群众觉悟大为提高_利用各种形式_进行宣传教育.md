[This dispatch from Weixian, 26th] During the land reform review in Ren County, various forms of propaganda and mobilization were utilized, greatly enhancing the masses' fighting spirit and class consciousness. At the first county, district, and village-level mobilization meeting on land reform, attended by over a thousand cadres, the county committee organized an education committee to lead discussions on introspection and policy interpretation. Even a few village cadres with "change of dynasty" thoughts and concerns about personal relationships overcame their worries and mustered the courage to fight. Each village established blackboards and broadcasting stations, and created ballads and new dramas during the struggle. Before the struggle, the masses sang a self-composed opera, "Overturning Interest," and when they sang, "Poor people can't pay the interest, their property is confiscated by the landlords, and they are driven out of the village to beg for food," the masses under the stage angrily shouted, "Down with the landlords!" Several people even wanted to go on stage to beat them. In the city, the masses performed a self-composed new drama, "The Old Imperial Court of Ren County," which exposed the feudal landlords' conspiracies of feigning fairness and deceiving the masses. At the land reform review meeting, an exhibition showcased one hundred and twenty-three kinds of cartoons from ten villages, all themed on the liberation of the masses, as well as more than sixty newly created ballads. Thousands of village cadres and the masses read them one by one with great interest. A child, after reading, "The struggle meeting is really good, we share the fruits and laugh heartily; Mom gets a spinning wheel, sister gets a fancy padded jacket, Dad gets a sickle and hoe, and I get a schoolbag to go to school," jumped up with joy. Propaganda department cadres performed current affairs skits. Chiang Kai-shek sang: "Foreign daddy, come quickly, let me tell you my heartfelt thoughts; we lose battles every day on the front lines, quickly help me think of a plan." Marshall sang: "My son, my son, don't worry, we have planes and cannons." The conspiracy of the US-Chiang clique was thoroughly exposed. Political work team cadres also performed land reform flower drum dances and land reform peep shows, which the masses watched and eagerly learned to sing. At the review meeting, the new work guidelines were also turned into clappers. One section talked about leveling and replenishing: "To turn over, a good policy, leveling and replenishing saves the poor. Flatten the mounds, fill the pits, whether rich or poor, everyone has food and clothing. Move the top, fill the bottom, we won't touch the middle peasant's component. To level, be serious, leveling isn't about averaging the property." Another section was about the middle peasant policy: "Speaking of middle peasants, talking of middle peasants, middle peasants are originally one family. If middle peasants make big mistakes, we criticize them in meetings but don't punish them. Upper-middle peasants, lower-middle peasants, we won't touch a single blade of grass or tree. Call on middle peasants to join the association, and participate in leadership is correct." After hearing this, the cadres said it was good and went back to the villages to teach the masses to sing. The masses danced the Yangko and composed songs, and joyful singing spread throughout the vast countryside.

    利用各种形式  进行宣传教育
    【本报威县二十六日电】任县翻身大检查中，利用各种形式进行宣传鼓动，群众斗争情绪及阶级觉悟大为提高。在第一次县区、村千余干部翻身动员会上，县委即组织了教育委员会，领导讨论反省和解释政策，少数有“变天”思想及情面观点的村干，也打破顾虑，鼓起了斗争勇气。各村在斗争中都建立了黑板报、广播台、创造了歌谣、新剧。群众在斗争前唱起自编歌剧：“倒息”，当唱到“穷人交不上利钱，被地主没收家产，赶到村外讨饭”时，台下群众愤恨的喊“打倒地主！”有几个群众真要上台去打。在城内，群众演出自编新剧“任县老朝廷”，把封建地主假公道、骗人统治群众的阴谋揭露无遗。在翻身大检查会上，展览了十村，一百二十三种以群众翻身为题材的漫画，及新创歌谣六十多节，千余村干部与群众一首一首的读着，津津有味。一个儿童读完“斗争会，真是好，分了果实哈哈笑；妈妈分了纺花车，姐姐分了大花袄，爹爹分了镰和锄，我分书包去上校。”喜的跳了起来。宣传部门干部演出时事活报，蒋介石唱：“洋爹爹，快快来，听我对你说开怀；天天前方打败仗，快快替我想计策。”马歇尔唱：“我儿我儿别发愁，飞机大炮咱都有。”把美蒋的阴谋揭发净尽。政工队干部也演出翻身花鼓、翻身大洋片，群众看了纷纷学唱。检查会上，把新的工作方针也编成快板，有一节说到填平补齐，“要翻身，好方针，填平补齐救穷人。平圪塔，把坑填，无论穷富有吃穿。动上头，下填平，中农成分咱不动。要填平，要认真，填平不是把产均。”一节是中农政策：“说中农，道中农，中农本是一家人。中农如果错误大，开会批评咱不罚。上中农，下中农，一草一木咱不动。叫中农，也入会，参加领导才是对。”干部听后，纷纷说好，并回村教给群众唱，群众纷纷扭秧歌，编歌唱，愉快的歌声普遍了广大的农村。
