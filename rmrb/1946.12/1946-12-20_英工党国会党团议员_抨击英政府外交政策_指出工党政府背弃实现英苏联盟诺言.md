    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: London dispatch: At a meeting of the Labour Party parliamentary group on the 11th, many MPs focused on criticizing the government's slow demobilization. They pointed out that the authorities are maintaining a large army, resulting in a shortage of labor for domestic production. British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons on the 21st of last month that the number of British army, navy, and air force personnel at the end of December this year would be 1,386,000, while the number announced in February this year for the end of the year after demobilization was 1,200,000.

    【新华社延安十六日电】伦敦讯：英工党国会党团（反对派）议员齐里亚库斯于十七日晚发表演说，抨击工党政府现行外交政策。他说：“政府没有自己的纲领，并背弃选举时所作的诺言，并未企图使英苏同盟付诸实现。”齐氏猛烈反对英美联合反苏。按：齐氏为著名工党进步分子，其著述甚富。
    【新华社延安十三日电】伦敦讯：工党国会党团于十一日开会时，许多议员集中批评政府复员的迟缓。指出当局保持庞大军队，以致国内生产劳动力不足，英首相艾德礼曾于上月二十一日在下院宣布本年十二月底英国海陆空三军人数为一百三十八万六千名，而今年二月所宣布之年底复员后的人数则为一百二十万人。
