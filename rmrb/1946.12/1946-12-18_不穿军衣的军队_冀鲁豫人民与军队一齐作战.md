An Army Without Military Uniforms
The People of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Fight Alongside the Army
Wu Xiang

If our army is the people wearing military uniforms, then our people are the army without military uniforms. Tens of thousands of them are organized and rush to the front lines, rescuing the wounded, transporting ammunition and food, scouting, communicating, leading the way... Even many Chiang Kai-shek officers, who like to blame their failures on accidental causes, after witnessing all this, consider "laying down their weapons a great fortune in misfortune." When the entire Direct Lineage 3rd Division was annihilated, Division Commander Zhao Xitian suffered a minor neck wound. He was carried off the front line on a stretcher by participating masses. He lay silently, using silence to maintain his last dignity. It was a rainy autumn night, the sky was as dark as the bottom of a pot, and the roads were muddy and slippery. After the stretcher team delivered him, they insisted on returning to the front to transport the wounded. They replied to those who tried to persuade them to stay overnight, "Comrades sacrificed and shed blood to win such a great victory for us. Are we still afraid of hurting our feet and falling?" At this time, Division Commander Zhao Xitian, who had been silent all along, suddenly let out a slight sigh. What was this Direct Lineage general sighing about? The people of the liberated areas, who had fought bitterly against the Japanese invaders for eight years, will never yield to Chiang Kai-shek's American weapons. There was an old man in Nanhua County named Liu Shunle, who was sixty years old, with a white beard hanging on his dark face. He quietly joined the stretcher team. When everyone found out, they didn't let him go. He said, "I've suffered all my life, and it was only after the Communist Party came that I was liberated and had two good days. Chiang Kai-shek still wants my sons and grandsons to suffer for the rest of their lives. If I don't risk my old life with him, what am I waiting for?" Meng Xianming from Dingtao County had a sore on his back that was swollen like a steamed bun and cracked open, but he refused to let anyone replace him on the stretcher. Wang Jingwu from Kunwu County led a stretcher company to the front line overnight. On the way, he was shot twice by special agents. By the time he arrived the next day, his wound was already aching, exposing the bone, but he refused to apply medicine until he had arranged the stretchers first. Those who usually lead the people to turn over a new leaf are now leading the people to participate in the war. Many district chiefs, county chiefs, and councilors have become models of participation, personally carrying wounded soldiers and delivering ammunition. Intellectuals, who have always been regarded as weak, are also vying to go to the front lines. Thirty-eight elementary school teachers in Pu County voluntarily participated in the war, including Wang Yixuan, who went three times in a row. In addition to carrying stretchers, they also read newspapers and explained current affairs to others along the way. After each battle, the masses who had contributed to the war received certificates of merit. They wrapped them in cloth and hid them in their close-fitting pockets. These glorious certificates are indeed worthy of being treasured, because they were obtained not by money, but by courage, hardship, and loyalty. Zhang Yunshan and Wang Er of the 3rd Militia Company of Juancheng went to Yuncheng, Juye, and Linze counties to deliver letters, traveling for four consecutive days. It was the rainy season at that time, and there was water everywhere on the road. They didn't know how many times they waded through water that covered their mouths, so they had to hold their guns and letters above their heads and walk on tiptoe. Zhang Yunshan's left foot had two bloody scars. Wang Er became ill from the water, but the gun and letter he carried were not wet at all. Fang Lancang from Pu County used to be a beggar. After liberation, he had five mu of land. He rescued color flags on the front line, carrying them many times in a row. His whole body was covered in blood, turning him into a person fished out of blood. When others asked him if he was afraid, he said, "Loyal ministers are not afraid of death, but afraid of not being loyal."

No matter how the reactionaries spread rumors and slanders, the masses who returned from participating in the war became more tenacious and determined, and were no longer afraid of American-made planes and artillery. Li Ya's and Li Shangge's of Juancheng became mixed up with the Chiang Kai-shek troops while rescuing the wounded. A Chiang Kai-shek soldier missed him with a shot. He rushed forward, grabbed the neck of a Chiang Kai-shek soldier, pressed him down, and snatched a rifle. He captured four prisoners in one night. His experience was: "The Guomindang troops look scary, but once they are disrupted, they are softer than tofu." Su Dongming, a militiaman from Yinlou, escorted ammunition to the front line. The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Kaocheng tried to intercept him, but he returned fire with several volleys, repelling the Chiang Kai-shek troops. In the Hua County campaign, the militia scouted and led the way through a depth of sixty miles of dense Chiang Kai-shek strongholds, providing strong support for the field army.

The Chiang Kai-shek troops who invaded the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region have been annihilated in eleven brigades in the past one hundred days. The people's army, combined with the people who are like the army, is a vast and boundless sea, and no warmongering adventurer can escape the fate of being overturned.

### 不穿军衣的军队  冀鲁豫人民与军队一齐作战

　　不穿军衣的军队
    冀鲁豫人民与军队一齐作战
    吴象
    如果我们的军队是穿着军衣的人民，那么我们的人民便是不穿军衣的军队，他们成千成万的组织起来奔赴前线，救护伤员、运送弹药粮食、侦察、通讯、带路…………连许多喜欢把自己失败归罪于偶然原因的蒋军军官，目睹这一切之后，也以“放下武器为不幸中之大幸”。嫡系整三师全部被歼时，师长赵锡田颈间负轻伤，由参战群众用担架抬下火线，他一声不响地躺着，用沉默来维持自己最后的尊严。那是个初秋的雨夜，天黑的像锅底，道路泥泞常滑脚，担架送到后，坚持要回前边去转运伤员，他们回答挽留他们过夜的人说：“同志们牺牲流血，为咱们打了这么大胜仗，咱们还怕脚痛摔跤吗？”这时候一直沉默的师长赵锡田，忽然发出了轻微的叹息，这位嫡系的将军是因为什么而叹息呢？与日寇苦斗过八年的解放区人民，是永远不会在蒋介石的美国武器面前屈服的。南华县有个老汉，名叫刘顺乐，六十岁了，乌黑的脸上挂着花白的长胡子，他悄悄地进了担架队，大家发现之后，都不让他去，他说：“我苦了一辈子，共产党来了，才翻身，才过了两天好日子，老蒋还想叫我儿子孙子再苦一辈子，我不和他拚老命还等啥？”定陶县的孟显明，背上长了疮，肿得像馒头似的裂着口，但他抬的担架总不肯让人换。昆吾县的王经乌，带领担架连夜赶赴前线，路上被特务打了两枪，第二天到时他伤口已经发痛，露出骨头了，但他非先按排好担架不肯去上药。平时领导人民翻身的，现在来领导人民参战，许多区长、县长、参议员，都成了参战模范，亲自下手抬伤兵、送弹药。历来被目为文弱的知识分子，也争着上前线。濮县小学教员，自动参战的有三十八个，其中有一个王宜轩，连接着去了三次。他们除了抬担架，还沿路给别人读报，讲解时事。每次战役结束，参战有功的群众都领到了功劳证，他们用布裹住，藏到贴身的口袋里，这光荣的证章，的确值得珍贵，因为取得它的不是金钱，而是勇敢艰苦与忠诚。鄄城民兵第三连的张运身和王二，到郓城巨野临泽县送信，连走了四天，那时正在雨季，路上到处有水，他们不知道淌了多少次水漫着了嘴，只好把枪和信举到头上，立着脚走，张运身左脚打了两条血淋淋乱巴。王二被水冲得病了，但他带的枪和信却没有湿一点。濮县房蓝仓，过去是个乞丐，翻身后有了五亩地，他在火线上抢救彩号，连着背了好多次，周身上下染满血，变成血里捞出来的人了，别人问他怕不怕，他说：“忠臣不怕死，怕死不忠臣。”
    不管反动派如何造谣诬蔑，但是群众参战回来，更加顽强坚决，不怕美制的飞机大炮了。鄄城李雅的、李尚阁，在抢救伤员时和蒋军混成一团了，蒋军一枪没打住他，他一个箭步上去，捉住脖子按倒一个蒋军，夺下一枝大盖枪，一夜他捉了四个俘虏，他的经验是：“遭殃军看着确是吓人，一打乱了比豆腐还松。”尹楼民兵苏东明，护送弹药到前线，考城蒋军想出来截击，他还了几排子枪，把蒋军击退了。滑县战役中，民兵通过六十里密布蒋军据点的纵深地带，侦察带路，给野战军以有力的配合。
    侵犯冀鲁豫的蒋军，一百天来已被歼灭十一个旅了，人民的军队结合着军队一样的人民，是浩渊无边的大海，任何好战的冒险家，都逃不脱倾覆的命运。
