    Overcoming the "Cutting Leeks" Mentality and Uniting the Broad Masses of Middle Peasants
    Shexian County Universally Carries Out Filling the Gaps
    [This report from our Changzhi correspondent, 10th] Under the slogan of "Leveling, Filling Gaps, and Thoroughly Realizing Land to the Tiller," the Mabu key point in Shexian County (including Nanbeiluanshiyan, Nanbeiguokou, Longhu, and other villages) has, from the 13th to the 23rd of last month, completely launched a struggle and liquidation movement against the evil landlords. In Nanbeiluanshiyan, the struggle has victoriously concluded on the 24th, and the masses are now actively discussing the distribution of the fruits of victory. In Nanbeiguokou, Mabu, Longhu, and other villages, fierce struggles have been launched successively since the 22nd. More than 2,000 peasants participated in the movement throughout the key point. At the beginning of the movement, an investigation was first conducted, and it was found that cadres and the masses generally harbored the thought of fearing "corrections," fearing that the problem would not be solved, and were not interested in the movement. Middle peasants were afraid of the "cutting leeks" mentality in the struggle. Some individual cadres harbored and shielded landlords, and the masses dared not struggle. After understanding the ideological crux, the leadership immediately proposed the slogan, "Middle and poor peasants are one family, everyone emancipates themselves, and thoroughly liquidates," After mass deliberation and discussion, the correct policy of "uniting the broad masses of peasants and thoroughly eliminating feudalism" was formulated. Only then did the masses understand that the filling the gaps movement was mainly to cut off the tail of feudalism in the end. In Beiguokou Village, more than ninety middle and poor women thronged into the peasant association in just two days. The enthusiasm of the masses has remained high. When struggling against the evil landlord Zhang Hongji in Beiguokou, the peasants angrily said: "You eat well, eating sorghum flour and shitting red, you try our power." In order to promote the movement throughout the key point, the leadership also organized joint struggles. (An Zengyuan)

    涉县普遍进行填补
    【本报长治十日电】在“填平补齐彻底实现耕者有其田”的口号下，老区涉县马布基点（包括南北乱石岩，南北郭口，龙虎等村），自上月十三日起至二十三日，已全部对恶霸地主展开诉苦清算运动。南北乱石岩在二十四日，斗争已胜利结束，现群众正积极讨论分配果实。南北郭口，马布，龙虎等村，二十二日已先后展开猛烈斗争。全基点参加运动的农民达二千余人。运动之初首先进行了调查，发现干部与群众中普遍的存在着，怕“纠正”、怕不解决问题，对运动不感兴趣的思想，中农有怕斗争割韭菜思想。个别干部包庇地主，群众不敢斗争等问题。了解思想症结后，领导上即提出，中贫农是一家，“大家翻身，彻底清算”的口号，经过群众酝酿讨论，规定出“团结广大农民，彻底消灭封建的正确方针，群众才明确了填补运动主要是最后割掉封建尾巴；北郭口村两天即有九十多个中贫妇女拥进了农会。群众情绪始终高涨，北郭口斗争恶霸地主张鸿基时，农民们激愤的说：“吃饭还哈，吃的高粱面拉的是红屎，你也试试我们的厉害”。领导上为推动全基点的运动，并组织了联合斗争。（安增元）
