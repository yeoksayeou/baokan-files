Editor-Reader Chat
　　We are willing to serve everyone

Dear readers and comrades:
　　Starting today, let's chat and exchange some ideas from time to time in the future. You may have noticed that we have opened some new columns in the past few issues, such as "Reader Consultant," "Brief Replies," and "Everyone's Talk," all of which are designed to serve everyone. If you have any questions or difficulties in your work, life, or study, please feel free to ask them, and we will definitely try to answer every question. Please also feel free to talk about criticisms and suggestions on all aspects of our liberated areas as if they were your own business. We will publish them as much as possible. Those that are not published in the newspaper will also be answered in writing. Let's all speak up actively!

　　编读谈心
  　我们愿替大家服务敬爱的读者同志们：
    从今儿开始，让我们以后随时来谈谈，交换一些意见吧。你也许注意到，这几期我们开辟了一些新栏，像“读者顾问”、“简复”、“大家谈”等，都是为了给大家服务的。诸位在工作中，生活上、学习时有什么疑难问题，请尽量提出来，我们一定设法作到有问必答。对我们解放区各方面的批评和建议，也请当作自家的事情一样放口谈，我们当尽可能刊登出来。不在报上发表的，也必写信答复。大家踊跃发言吧！
