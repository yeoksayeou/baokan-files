　　Zhubi Village, Lincheng
    Helping Military Families Establish Households
    [Our newspaper's Lincheng dispatch] During the land redistribution movement, Zhubi Village helped impoverished and widowed/orphaned military and martyrs' families establish households. The village has a total of twenty-seven households of new and old military families and martyrs' families, all of whom have been allocated sufficient land, housing, and livestock, and are living a well-fed and clothed new middle peasant life. Among them, six impoverished military families lacking labor were allocated 49 mu of land, 68 rooms, one and a half head of livestock, 5.7 dou of grain, and clothing and furniture. On average, each person received 3 mu of land, 4 rooms, and 2.3 dou of grain, and all rose to the level of middle peasants. The original fourteen middle peasant households were allocated 24 mu of land and a large amount of grain and clothing. Even three wealthy middle peasant households received items, with an average of more than 5.5 mu of land per person, and their living standards generally improved. Ma Fuxiang, a poor family member of a soldier, used to be a hired laborer. During the famine years, his wife fled to Gaoyi, but later returned home with the help of the government. He was allocated 16 mu of land, a good house, and half a donkey, and his life had a source of support. His wife's work performance was exceptionally active, saying, "Without the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party, my family wouldn't have what we have today." She encouraged her husband to work hard to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and protect our good times. (Zi Jian)
