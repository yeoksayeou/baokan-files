　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 6th: A war has broken out between the Iranian province of Azerbaijan and the Tehran government of Iran. According to the Tabriz Gazette, Iranian government troops and gendarmes crossed the border into Azerbaijan province at 10:00 AM on the 4th, attacking the Azerbaijan defense forces' outposts. The Gazette declared that Azerbaijan province has entered a state of war and called on residents to resist the invasion. It is reported that in late November, Iranian Prime Minister Sultani, under the pretext of supervising elections, requested to station troops in Azerbaijan, which was rejected by the latter. Tabriz pointed out that the Iranian government's actions violated the agreement signed by both sides in June, which stipulated that the Azerbaijan National Army is the legal army of Azerbaijan province.

　　反动派弃约进攻阿塞拜疆
  　伊朗爆发内战
    【新华社延安六日电】大不里士讯：伊朗阿塞拜疆省与伊朗德黑兰政府之间爆发战事。据大不里士公报称：伊朗政府军与宪兵队于四日上午十时越入阿塞拜疆省边界，进攻阿塞拜疆防军前哨。公报宣布阿省已进入战争状态，并号召居民抵抗侵略。按十一月下旬伊总理苏尔丹尼曾以监督选举为借口，要求驻军阿塞拜疆，而为后者所拒绝。大不里士方面指出，伊政府之行动违背六月间双方所订立的协定，该协定规定阿省国民军为阿省的合法军队。
