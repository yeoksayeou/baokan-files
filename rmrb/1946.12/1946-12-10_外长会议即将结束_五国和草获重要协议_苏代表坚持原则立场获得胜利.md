　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 5th: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in New York is nearing its conclusion. According to a TASS correspondent in New York, agreements have been reached on many important issues since the end of last month and the beginning of this month, and the final work on drafting peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland is nearing completion. Regarding the Danube River issue, an agreement has been largely reached based on Molotov's proposal. Regarding the convening of a conference on Danube River navigation, the Soviet Union suggested that the Danube River countries and the four powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France should participate, but this decision is not included in the treaty, and Greece cannot participate in the meeting. Regarding the Romanian-Bulgarian border, the four powers decided to remain unchanged. The TASS correspondent stated: "The scope of unresolved issues in the peace treaties with the former Hitlerite German allies has been increasingly narrowed."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 5th: TASS New York correspondent reports: At the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet delegation, based on a firm principled stance, overcame the attempts of other major powers' representatives to force the Soviet Union to accept their will. The American and British representatives were no less eager than the Soviet Union to sign the five-nation peace treaties. Therefore, they finally had to make some concessions, thus enabling all clauses of the Trieste Free Territory to be negotiated and unanimously decided, making the drafting of the treaties a turning point. The correspondent then elaborated on the various agreements on the Trieste Free Territory as follows: Regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Trieste, the United States, especially Britain, strongly opposed specifying a date, but later agreed to the Soviet proposal, that is, the governor would decide on the withdrawal of troops within ninety days of taking office, and agreed that the troops stationed by the United States, Britain, and Yugoslavia should not exceed 5,000. Regarding the date of the election of the Trieste National Assembly, the Soviet Union suggested that elections be held within four months, which the United States and Britain initially opposed, but later agreed. Regarding the affiliation of the police chief, the United States and Britain advocated that he be responsible to the governor, while the Soviet Union advocated that he be responsible to the locally elected government. Finally, it was decided that the governor has the right to appoint the police chief, and the police chief works under the guidance of the government committee, and his powers are only transferred to the governor in exceptional circumstances. Regarding the relationship between the governor and the provisional government during the transition period, the American and British representatives proposed granting the governor special privileges, and the provisional government would only be a consultative body. The Soviet Union opposed this, and it was finally decided that the governor and the Italian and Yugoslav governments would consult and select members of the provisional government, and the powers of the governor and the provisional government would be based on permanent legislation. Bevin declared reservations on this and would decide later.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 6th: According to a TASS New York correspondent's report: The obvious turning point in the work of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, especially the agreement on several important issues in the draft peace treaties with the five countries, has led American newspapers to believe that the work of formulating the treaties will be completed as soon as possible, and they are satisfied with this. The Soviet delegation's efforts to reach a unanimous agreement have been widely recognized. Radio commentator Swine said: "The deadlock has obviously been overcome, and everyone has breathed a sigh of relief. As a result of diplomatic success, the Soviet Union has gained new friends. The Soviet representative's negotiating art has taken a winning position in the negotiations, while our American delegation has lost." United Press reported: Shackford said: "Bevin, for the first time, agreed with the Soviet Union and opposed Britain on important treaty issues. He agreed to reduce the total amount of Bulgarian reparations and increase Italian reparations. This is completely different from Bevin's policy at the Paris Peace Conference. This is a result of the recent talks with Molotov." The New York Herald Tribune, which is close to the State Department, said in an editorial: "The Soviet Union has fought tenaciously to the end on every issue. They have won on many issues."

　　外长会议即将结束
  　五国和草获重要协议
  　苏代表坚持原则立场获得胜利
    【新华社延安五日电】纽约四强外长会议即将结束。据塔斯社驻纽约特派员报导，早在上月底及本月初对许多重大问题已获协议，拟订对意罗保匈芬五国和约最后工作已近于完成。关于多瑙河问题，根据莫洛托夫建议已大体获致协议。关于召开多瑙河通航会议，苏建议多瑙河各国及苏美英法四强参加，但这一决定不包括在和约中，希腊不能参加会议。关于罗保边界，四强决定不变。塔斯社记者称：“关于对前希特勒德国同盟各国和约中未获协议问题的范围已日益缩小。”
    【新华社延安五日电】塔斯社纽约特派员报导：在纽约外长会议上，苏代表团根据原则坚定立场，战胜了其他强国代表们以他们的意志强使苏联接受的企图。美英代表在急于签订五国和约的一点上并不下于苏联，因之最后不得不作某些让步，从而使自由区的一切条款都获得协商，一致的决定，使草拟和约的折冲得到一转捩点。该记者继阐述的港自由区各项协议如下：关于撤退的港外国军队，美国特别是英国曾剧烈反对规定日期，后来才同意苏方建议，即总督在上任后九十天内决定撤军，并同意美英南三国驻军不得超过五千人。关于的港国民议会选举的日期，苏方建议四个月内选举之，英美原先反对，后才同意。关于警察局长从属关系，英美曾主何总督负责，苏联主向当地民选政府负责，最后决定总督有权委任警察局长，警察局长在政府委员会指导下工作，仅在非常情况下其权利才转交给总督。关于过渡时期总督与临时政府关系，美英代表曾提出予总督特权，临时政府仅为咨询机关，苏联反对，最后决定由总督与意南政府磋商遴选临时政府委员，总督与临时政府权利，依据永久法制。贝文对此声明保留，待日后决定。
    【新华社延安六日电】据塔斯社纽约特派记者报导：外长会议工作中显然的转变点，特别是对五国和约草案中几个重要问题的协议，使得美国报纸认为制定和约工作将尽早完成，并对此感到满意。苏联代表团为达到一致协议决定的努力，已获得广泛的承认。无线电评论员史温说：“僵局显然已被克服，每一个人都松了一口气，由于外交成功的结果，苏联已获得了新朋友。苏代表的谈判艺术，在谈判中占了赢得的立场，而我们美代表团是输了。”合众社讯：沙克福德称：“贝纳斯第一次在和约重要问题上赞成苏联而反对英国，他同意减低保加利亚赔款总量，而增加意大利赔款，这是与贝纳斯在巴黎和会上的政策完全不同，这是最近与莫洛托夫会谈的后果。”接近国务院的纽约先驱论坛报社论说：“苏联对于每一问题都是坚持顽强地奋斗到底，他们在许多问题上已胜利了。”
