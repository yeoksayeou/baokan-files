　　Snippets from the Battle of Hua County
    Jiluyu Xinhua Branch
    Entering Li Zhuangtou First
    The glorious task of attacking Li Zhuang was undertaken by the Ninth Company. At the start of the battle, combat hero Tian Mengqing declared, "To liberate the people, I must charge forward today and I won't come back until the mission is complete."
    The wall was about two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters) high and the trench was eight chi (approximately 2.6 meters) deep. Tian Mengqing led the Second Squad forward under the enemy's dense fire. Mengqing agilely climbed onto the wall. To avoid being hit by his own fire, he rolled over and entered the village alone. A piece of shrapnel wounded his head, but he persevered regardless, using two hand grenades to scatter the enemies around him, single-handedly controlling a small house until the troops came up. Guided by him, the troops advanced to the west of the village and resolved the battle in an hour.
　  Reporting the Capture of Five Mountain Guns Quickly
    The grenade launcher squad of the Ninth Company of a certain regiment was always with the infantry during the battle. Xie Wenxue was a soldier liberated from the Dayang Lake battle. When the troops entered Shao'erzhai, he spotted an enemy trying to sneak away. He jumped up and finished off the enemy. Turning around, he ran into his squad leader Zhao Xuetang with a mountain gun. He immediately asked someone to send a message to the instructor, saying, "We got a mountain gun, report it in the newspaper quickly." At this time, the Seventh Squad also captured a mountain gun and shouted, "Report ours in the newspaper quickly." Then the Eighth Company also captured two, and the Tenth Company also captured one. Instructor Fang was extremely busy, calling the brigade headquarters and saying, "We've captured five mountain guns, report it in the newspaper quickly!"
  　Capturing a Hundred People with One Sentence
    Duan Binghe, the deputy platoon leader of the Second Platoon of the Ninth Company of a certain regiment, was calling on the troops to advance towards Shao'erzhai when he suddenly discovered a group of Chiang's troops. He quickly pulled the pin on a hand grenade. An officer ran out from the enemy and quickly grabbed the deputy platoon leader's hand, saying, "Please don't hurt people, we surrender." Duan Binghe said only one sentence: "Insurance is no problem." More than a hundred Chiang's troops automatically surrendered their weapons.
　  Newly Liberated Soldier Accepts Surrender from an Entire Platoon
    Liu Guowan from a certain unit, was liberated from the Juye Campaign. After a short period of life in the Eighth Route Army, he said: "I have been a soldier for ten years, and I have seen through the 'Central Army.' If you have no face there, it is not possible, you can only be a soldier for the rest of your life." This time, he was very brave and alert. No matter how fierce the enemy's guns were, he calmly aimed and hit the enemy. When the enemy broke through, he rushed to the front alone, shouting in the rain of bullets: "Brothers, don't fight, surrender and you won't be killed. I also just came from the Central Army, it hasn't even been ten days!" The enemy replied: "Are you really not going to kill us?" Liu Guowan said: "How can that be false, if you killed me, would I still be alive?" So the entire enemy platoon surrendered to him. He took the enemy's weapons and didn't touch their personal belongings at all.
  　One Hundred and Nine Boxes of Bullets
    The Third Squad of the Fourth Company of the 3019 unit suddenly rushed into Shao'erzhai village. When they rushed to an open area, they found a layer of loose soil on the ground, and two holes. The Third Squad leader deployed the whole squad on the holes. The first platoon leader and the Third Squad leader crawled in. Inside was the enemy's ammunition depot. They resolved to move the enemy's bullets back to the company. The enemy fired more than a dozen shells from the left, all landing nearby. A soldier, Chen, had his face blackened by the explosion, but the whole squad didn't move at all, and finally moved all one hundred and nine boxes of bullets back.
　  New Soldiers on the Front Line
    Zhang Suide, a new soldier of the 3019 detachment, had only joined the army for ten days or so. During the Shao'erzhai battle, he was in the assault squad and ran at the head during the charge. He had no combat experience and followed the squad leader's instructions. The first grenade he threw was the one that exploded on the high house occupied by the enemy. After the battle, the whole squad chose him as a combat model. He was extremely happy and considered it the greatest honor in his life. Meng Shaoliang, a soldier of the Fourth Squad of the Ninth Company of a certain regiment, served as the leader of the assault group when attacking the enemy in Li Zhuang. As soon as he received the order, he climbed onto the village wall in swift steps, greatly encouraging all the new comrades in the company, who braved the artillery fire and quickly climbed onto the village wall from the ladders. After the battle, the new soldiers all said: "Fighting is nothing to be afraid of." Some got heavy machine guns, some got mortars, and some led the enemy's horses. Everyone brought back some spoils of victory and happily said, "Victory! Victory! We can win this time, and we will be able to win more victories next time when we have more experience."

　　滑县歼灭战片断
    冀鲁豫新华分社
    攻进李庄头一名
    光荣的李庄主攻任务，由九连担负。战斗开始，战斗英雄用梦清首先表示：“为了解救老百姓，今天我一定要打上去，完不成任务不回来。”
    围墙约有二丈高，壕沟有八尺深。田梦清带领二班在敌人浓密炮火下前进，梦清敏捷的登上墙头，为了避免自己火力的误伤，他打了个滚，单人进入砦里。一块炸弹皮伤了他头部，他却不顾一切地坚持着，他用两颗手榴弹打散身边的敌人，一个人控制了一个小屋，直到部队上来。部队在他引导下，发展到村西，一小时解决了战斗。
　  缴到五门山炮赶快登报
    某团九连掷弹筒班，战斗时始终和步兵在一起。谢文学是大杨湖战斗解放过来的战士。部队打进邵耳寨，他发现一个敌人正想溜走，他一下蹦上去把敌人解决了。转过来，跟他班长赵学堂碰上了一门山炮，马上请人捎信给教导员说：“咱们得了一门山炮，赶快登个报。”这时七班也缴了一门山炮，也叫喊起来：“快给咱登个报。”接着连八连也缴到两门，十连也缴了一门。方教导员可忙极了，打电话给大队部说：“缴到五门山炮，赶快登报！”
  　一句话俘虏一百人
    某团九连二排副段炳合，正招呼部队向邵耳砦前进，忽然发现一股蒋军，连忙抽开手榴弹的拉火线，敌人中间跑出了一个军官，赶紧拉住排副的手说：“千万不要毁人，我们投降。”段炳合只说一句话：“保险没问题。”一百多个蒋军自动缴了械。
　  新解放战士一人缴一排的械
    某部刘果万，是鄄城战役解放过来的。经过短期的八路军生活，他说：“我当了十年兵，看透了‘中央军’，在那里你要是没面子，可不行，你就只能当一辈子兵。”这次作战他非常勇敢机警，不管敌人的枪炮打得多凶，他还是沉着瞄准打敌人。敌人突围了，他一个人冲到前面去，弹雨中高喊：“弟兄们，不要打了，缴枪不杀，我也是刚从中央军过来的，还不到十天哪！”敌人答话了：“你们真的不杀吗？”刘果万说：“那还能假，要杀我还能活吗？”于是敌人全排向他缴了枪。他把敌人武器收下，私人东西一点也没动。
  　一零九箱子弹
    三○一九四连三班，猛地冲进了邵耳砦村内，当冲到一个开阔地带时，发现地上是一层松土，还有两个洞，三班长就把全班人布置在洞上，一排长和三班长钻进去，里面是敌人的弹药库，他们决心把敌人的子弹搬回连上。敌人从左边打来了十几个炮弹，都落在附近，战士陈某人的脸被炸弹薰黑了，但全班人没动一动，终于把一百零九箱子弹全部搬运回来。
　  火线上的新战士
    三○一九小队新战士张绥德，才参军十来天，邵耳寨战斗中他在突击班，冲锋时他跑在头里；他没有战斗经验，很听从班长指挥。敌人占的高房上，最先爆炸的手榴弹就是他投的。战斗结束后，全班选他为战斗模范，他高兴极了，认为是平生最大的光荣。某团九连四班战士孟绍良，在攻打李庄敌人时，担任突击组小组长，刚接受了命令，他就飞步爬上了寨墙，大大地鼓舞了全连新同志，都冒着炮火，快步从梯子上登上了寨墙。战斗结束后，新战士们都说：“打仗也没啥可怕的。”有的人得了重机枪，有的得了迫击炮，有的牵着敌人的马匹，多少都拿回了些胜利品，都高兴地说：“胜利了！胜利了！这回还能打胜仗，下次有了经验，更能打胜仗了。”
