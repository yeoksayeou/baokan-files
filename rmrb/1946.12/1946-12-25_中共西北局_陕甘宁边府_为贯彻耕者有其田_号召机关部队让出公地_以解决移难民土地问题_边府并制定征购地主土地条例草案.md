Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government and the CCP Northwest Bureau have recently called on all organs and troops to relinquish public land farmed by themselves to solve the land problems of migrant refugees and implement the policy of "Land to the Tiller." A committee for handling public land farmed by organs and troops was established a few days ago to plan and lead this effort in a unified way. At its first meeting, the committee decided that all organs and troops must strengthen production next year, but should develop in the direction of reducing quantity and improving quality. Public land other than vegetable gardens and farmland needed for self-sufficiency should be handed over to the government for distribution to landless migrant refugees, along with loans of plows, tools, grain, and seeds to help them with production. According to the Border Region Government's policy of encouraging migrant refugees, Yan'an County alone has resettled more than 30,000 migrant refugees in the past eight years, providing them with adequate food and clothing. Most of those who arrived earlier have already obtained land; those who arrived later also rent or jointly farm land, but land ownership has not been completely resolved. Therefore, the Border Region Government and the Northwest Bureau have issued this call to seek a thorough solution. The Yan'an Prefectural Commissioner's Office has taken the lead in responding, relinquishing 30 mu of river land and 400 mu of mountain land. The Border Region Government has now sent working groups to various places to assist county and district cadres in distributing public land to landless migrant refugees.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. In order to implement land public bonds to requisition and purchase landlord land and achieve the goal of "Land to the Tiller" before next year's spring plowing, the Border Region Government issued an order a few days ago and promulgated the "Draft Regulations on the Requisition and Purchase of Landlord Land." (Editor's note: The draft will be published separately once it is collected in full.) The order pointed out:

In areas of the Border Region where land has not been distributed, the land gradually transferred into the hands of the farmers due to the voluntary land dedication of some enlightened landlords during the rent reduction movement over the years. However, landlords still own a considerable amount of land, and there are still a considerable number of farmers who have no land to cultivate or insufficient land. In order to realize "Land to the Tiller," in accordance with the resolution of the Second Committee of the Border Region Government, the "Draft Regulations on the Requisition and Purchase of Landlord Land in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" has been formulated and is hereby promulgated. All areas that have thoroughly reduced rent should immediately implement it in accordance with this draft regulation. In areas where rent investigation and reduction is not yet thorough, it is urgent to continue mobilizing the masses to universally carry out rent investigation and reduction. On the basis of implementing rent reduction work, requisition and purchase landlord land in accordance with this draft regulation, in order to achieve the goal of completely solving the land problem before the spring plowing next year.

　　中共西北局
    陕甘宁边府
    为贯彻耕者有其田
    号召机关部队让出公地
    以解决移难民土地问题
    边府并制定征购地主土地条例草案
    【新华社延安廿二日电】陕甘宁边区政府及中共西北局，顷号召各机关部队让出自耕之公地，以解决移难民的土地问题，实现耕者有其田政策。并于日前成立机关部队自耕公地处理委员会，统一计划领导。该会在首次会议上，决定各机关部队须加强明年生产，但应向减少数量、提高质量方向发展。让出必需自给之菜地与自耕地以外之公地，交政府分给无地的移难民，并借给耕牛、工具、粮食、种籽等，以帮助其生产。按在边府奖励移难民政策下，八年来仅延安县即安置移难民三万余口，使其食饱衣暖。其中早来者，大多已得到土地；后来者亦租种或伙种土地，但地权尚未彻底解决，故边府与西北局特发此号召，以求彻底解决。延属专署已首起响应，让出川地三十亩，山地四百亩，现边府已派出工作组赴各地协助县区干部将公地分给无地的移难民。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】陕甘宁边区为实行土地公债，以征购地主土地，在明年春耕以前达成耕者有其田的目的，边区政府特于日前发出命令，并公布“征购地主土地条例草案”。（编者按：草案一俟收齐，另行发表），该命令指出：
    边区未经分配土地地区，经过历年减租运动，因部分开明地主自动献地义举，使部分土地逐渐转入农民手中。但在地主阶级之中，现仍占有相当数量的土地，农民中无地耕种或耕地不足者，亦不在少数。为实现耕者有其田起见，特依据本府第二次委员会之决议，制定“陕甘宁边区征购地主土地条例”草案，随令公布，凡已彻底减租地区，应即遵照本条例草案实行，在查减尚不彻底的地区，亟须继续发动群众，普遍进行查租减租，在贯彻减租工作的基础之上，依据本条例草案进行征购地主土地，以期在明年春耕之前达成彻底解决土地问题的目的。
