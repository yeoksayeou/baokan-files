    Resolutely Defend the Good Times
    Jinnan Villages are Busy with Military Training
    Attention is Being Paid to Correcting Formalism and the Tendency to Neglect Production
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Weixian, 10th] The emancipated peasants of Jinnan are launching a military training movement. Beifengzheng Village in Jize, where the principle of "land to the tiller" has been thoroughly realized, is undergoing large-scale military training of all its young and middle-aged people under the leadership of mass leader Liao Hubian. Militiamen and self-defense forces are learning to aim, shoot, and bayonet every day. Self-defense force members are using pitchforks, hoes, sickles, broadswords, and red-tasseled spears, combined with martial arts practice, to practice stabbing. Dong Xinzhang, the squad leader of the self-defense force, said: "I asked a carpenter to make a wooden gun for each of us, so we can learn to aim and stab, and go to the front line to eliminate old Chiang." Sixty-five-year-old Dong Peifu is practicing with a sickle even more vigorously, saying: "We have just been emancipated, and Chiang Kai-shek is coming to take away our rice bowl again. We must practice well first, and even if we have to use a sickle, we will fight him to the end." Militiamen in Hengshui, Wuyi, Ji County, Fudong and other counties have also enthusiastically launched military training movements. When the sky is full of stars, the sound of drill commands can be heard in every village. Military training is being carried out unusually widely and rapidly in various places. According to Comrade Wang Chao, director of the Military Affairs Committee of the Third District of Hengshui, the rapid and widespread nature of this winter's military training is due to two reasons: 1. The peasants, having obtained land, have realized the importance of armed defense of their fruits. 2. Old Chiang is going to attack the liberated areas and kick the people's rice bowls, and the people have realized that they must arm themselves to fight. However, due to the lack of experience in leading military training, some deviations have also occurred: 1. It has not been carried out in conjunction with the reorganization of the militia, and the cadres have a purely military training mentality, so they have relaxed the reorganization and consolidation of the militia. 2. It has not taken good care of the peasants' production, resulting in coercive orders. 3. It emphasizes form over practicality, and the combination with reality is insufficient. The leadership is currently studying how to correct these issues.

    坚决保卫好时光
    冀南村村练兵忙
    正注意纠正形式主义及忽视生产偏向
    【本报威县十日电】冀南翻身农民展开练兵运动。彻底实现耕者有其田的鸡泽北风正村，在群众领袖廖虎便领导下，全村青壮年正进行大练兵。民兵、自卫队每天学习瞄准、射击、刺枪，自卫队队员用叉、锄、镰、大刀、红缨枪，结合武术练习刺杀。自卫队班长董新章说：“我叫木匠给咱每人做一枝木枪，学会瞄准刺杀，好上前线消灭大老蒋。”六十五岁的董佩傅拿着镰练的更是带劲，他说：“咱才翻身，蒋介石又来端咱的饭碗子，咱先练习好，拿镰也得给他干到底”。衡水、武邑、冀县、阜东等县民兵，亦热烈的展开了练兵运动。满天星斗的时候，各村都响起了喊操声。各地练武开展的异常普遍与迅速。据衡水三区武委会主任王潮同志说，今冬练武的迅速与普遍，原因有二：一、因农民得到土地后，已感到武装保卫果实的重要。二、老蒋要进攻解放区踢人民的饭碗子，人民都认识到非武装起来干不行。但由于领导上对练兵还缺乏经验，亦产生了些偏差：一、没有与整理民兵结合进行，干部存有单纯练武的思想，所以放松了整理与巩固民兵。二、没有很好的照顾农民的生产，产生强迫命令现象。三、重形式，实用，与实际结合不够。现领导上正研究纠正中。
