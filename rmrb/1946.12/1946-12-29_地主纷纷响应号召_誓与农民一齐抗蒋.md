　　Landlords Respond to Call
　　Vow to Resist Chiang Kai-shek Alongside Peasants
　　[Further News] The Yuanzhao County government issued a proclamation at the beginning of this month, calling on all households in the county who had been subjected to land redistribution to resist Chiang Kai-shek, love the country, abide by the law, and that the government would guarantee their human and property rights to maintain their livelihoods. Those who illegally collude with Chiang Kai-shek or disrupt order would be severely punished. After the proclamation reached the villages, the households subjected to land redistribution voluntarily swore and signed before the masses, expressing their commitment to abide by the law, resist Chiang's troops alongside the peasants, concentrate on production, get rich, and follow the path of Zhang Yongtai.
