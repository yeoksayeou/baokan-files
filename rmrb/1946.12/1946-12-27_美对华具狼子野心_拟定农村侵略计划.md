　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 15th, the "Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Group" has drafted a "Comprehensive Plan for Chinese Agriculture." This group returned to the United States in mid-November after traveling through fifteen provinces in China to investigate the state of Chinese agriculture. The plan now drafted by the group advocates devaluing exchange rates and providing credit loans to the Chinese market. "Its purpose is to flood the Chinese countryside with cheaper American goods under the low exchange rate, and to put American usury chains on Chinese farmers, turning China into a complete American colony." Prior to this, according to a US Information Service dispatch from Washington on November 25th, the American members of the group, after returning to their country, published the results of their investigation, reaching the extremely absurd conclusion that "the basic problem currently facing China, and the root of all difficulties, is overpopulation and insufficient arable land." Regarding one of China's basic problems, the feudal landlord system, they called it "Communist propaganda material." Moreover, they did not mention the more important basic problem of China, namely imperialist rule. The conclusion also stated: "The only solution is to 'control production,' otherwise China will continue to have hardship, famine, and rebellions of desperate people." Observers here believe that the long-bankrupt Malthusian population theory has been brought up again, simply to conceal the American imperialist attempt to "control" Chinese agriculture, while at the same time proving the American imperialists' complete ignorance of Chinese problems.

　　美对华具狼子野心
    拟定农村侵略计划
    【新华社延安二十日电】据中央社华盛顿十五日讯透露：“中美农业技术合作团”已拟定《关于中国农业之庞大计划》。按该团系于上月中旬返美，在中国时他们曾遍历十五省，考察中国农业情况。现在该团拟定之计划，主张贬低汇率，供给中国市场以信用贷款，“其目的就是在低汇率下以更廉价美货淹没中国农村，并对中国农民加以美国高利贷锁链，使中国变为十足的美国殖民地。在此以前，据美国新闻处华盛顿十一月二十五日讯透露，该团美方人员于返国后，曾发表其考察结果，所作之极荒谬结论，认为“中国目前所面临之基本问题，亦即一切困难的根本为人口过多，而可耕之田不足”。而对中国基本问题之一的封建地主制度，则称之为“共产党之宣传材料”。一面对于另一更重要的中国基本问题，即帝国主义的统治，更一字未提。该结论并称：“唯一办法为‘管制生产’，否则中国将续有困苦饥荒及亡命之徒的叛乱”。此间观察家认为早已破产的马尔萨斯人口论重新被提出来，无非用以掩饰美国“管制”中国农业的帝国主义企图却同时证明了美帝国主义者对中国问题的一窍不通。
