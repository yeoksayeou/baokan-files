　　The New Cultural Entertainment Craze in Ningnan

　　Men, Women, Old and Young All Take the Stage, New Dramas and Yangge Popular
　　Complaining About a Lifetime of Suffering, Joyfully Singing of Today's Good Times
　　[Report from Our Correspondent in Weixian, 1st] Happy songs resound in the villages of Ningnan. After the peasants were liberated, cultural and entertainment activities have become unprecedentedly active. They reject the old entertainment that promoted feudal superstition, harmed social customs, and served feudal landlords. Villages compose and perform their own works, using old forms with new content to sing about their new lives. The countryside has changed from its silence of thousands of years. The peasant-organized theater troupes in the county already number more than twenty, with new dramas and Yangge dramas becoming very popular. The peasants of Dongwang Township, based on events in their villages, have composed four plays, including "The Joy of Peasants' Emancipation," "A Choral of Ten Agricultural Associations," "The Liberation of a Suffering Woman," and "From Bitterness to Sweetness." Nan Dingcao composed plays such as "Beat Old Jiang" and "Beat the Local Tyrants." Zhangjiazhuang composed "The Great Emancipation of the Peasants," and Mengzhuang has "Oppose the Abuse of Wives." Three peasants from Nan Dingcao stayed up for three nights to jointly compose a play. The plots are all based on true stories from the village's past, and they are performed in front of the masses, which is very popular. New plays are performed in various villages, with men, women, old and young all taking the stage, full of life and color. The masses said, "Old operas cost money and only sing about officials and bureaucrats; now we don't have to spend money, we compose and perform ourselves, and everyone is so happy!" Many villages also use old songs to compose new lyrics, new Daggu, and fast-clapper rhymes. The west town of Dongwang composed fast-clapper rhymes to praise the model groups of the agricultural association, which is very popular among the masses. The song "Beat Old Jiang" is even more prevalent in various villages. A little girl in Dongwang can sing eleven new songs. An old lady, Xia, who is seventy years old, had been chanting Buddhist scriptures for many years. After being liberated, she no longer believes in Buddhism and reformed the tune of chanting Buddhist scriptures, composing songs such as "After Liberation, Don't Forget Chairman Mao," "Struggle Song," "Persuading the Backward," "Celebrating the Model," and "Beat Old Jiang." Another scripture-chanting old woman, Dan, used the Lotus tune to compose a new song entitled "Old People Also Like It." The lyrics are "The old woman is no longer worried, walking forward with her crutch, thinking of Chairman Mao in her heart, she will work hard even if she dies; I will compare myself with the young people, huh-ah, and see who is active, huh-ah. Twisting well and singing wonderfully, we just refuse to grow old; although our ears are deaf and our eyes are dim, we sing no worse; everyone who sees us praises us, huh-ah, and our hearts are so happy that we all want to sing, ah-yah huh-ah." Jiang Xiaotong, a hired worker from the south town of Dongwang, used to work for the landlord, earning thirty-six yuan a year, only one dime a day. People gave him the nickname "Old Dime." He composed his experience into a fast-clapper rhyme: "Starving to death, not working for the evil landlords; eating cornbread in the morning, and corn dumplings at noon. When a short-term worker enters the door, two big basins of thin porridge; stir the spoon three times, and the waves kill people. When you are a short-term worker, you work slowly, or you will exhaust several people to death; it's not that we can't work, we only eat sorghum noodles; no oil in the vegetables, and thin white porridge to drink." Whenever a new song is composed, the peasants always relate it to themselves and modify it with each other. It has played a great role in continuing to enlighten the peasants' awareness and educate them.

　　几千年沉闷一扫光
    宁南新文娱风行
    翻身农民自编自唱教育自己
    男女老少齐上台新剧秧歌大时兴
    怨诉半生苦日月欢唱今天好光景
    【本报威县一日电】快乐的歌声洋溢在宁南各村，农民翻身后，文化娱乐空前活跃。他们厌弃宣传封建迷信、伤风败俗、为封建地主服务的旧游艺，各村自编自唱，用旧形式新内容，歌唱自己的新生活，乡村改变了几千年来的沉寂。农民组织的剧团，全县已有二十多个，新剧和秧歌剧大大时兴。东汪三镇的农民，根据本村的事，编出《农民翻身乐》、《对唱农会十编》、《苦妇翻身》、《苦尽甜来》等四个剧，南丁曹编出《打老蒋》、《打恶霸》等剧，张家庄编出《农民大翻身》，孟庄编有《反对虐待老婆》，南丁曹三个农民三夜没睡觉，合编了一个剧，剧情都是本村过去的真事，又在群众面前演出，很受欢迎。各村新剧出演，男女老少一齐上台，有声有色，群众说：“旧戏花钱，净唱为官为宦的；现在咱不用花钱，自编自唱，大家多快乐！”各村利用旧歌曲，编制新歌词、新大鼓、快板也很多。东汪西镇编出快板，表扬农会模范组，很受群众欢迎，《打老蒋》歌更是盛行各村。东汪的一个小女孩能唱十一个新歌子，七十岁的老太太夏氏念佛多年，翻身后不再信佛，改造了念佛的调子，编出《翻身后不忘毛主席》、《斗争歌》、《劝落后》、《贺模范》、《打老蒋》等歌曲。另一个念佛老妇耽氏，用莲花调编了一首新歌，题是《老人也喜欢》，歌词是“老婆婆不再愁，拉着拐棍往前走，心里想着毛主席呀，泼死泼活也要干；俺跟青年比一比呀呼唉，看谁积极呀呼唉。扭的好唱的妙，俺们就是不服老；耳虽聋，眼虽花，唱起歌来可不差；人人看见都是夸呀呼唉，心里高兴都要唱啊呀呼唉”。东汪南镇的雇工姜小同，过去给地主扛活，每年工资三十六元，每天整合一毛钱，人们送他绰号“老一毛”，他把自己的经历编成快板：“饿死饿活，不给恶霸地主做活；清早吃糠饼子，晌午吃糠窝窝。短工进了门，稀饭两大盆；勺子搅三搅，浪头打死人。当了短工磨洋工，要不累死几口人；不是咱不能干，光吃高粱面；吃菜不加油，喝的稀白粥”。每逢新歌编出，农民总是联系到自己，互相修改。对继续启发农民的觉悟、教育农民，起了很大作用。
