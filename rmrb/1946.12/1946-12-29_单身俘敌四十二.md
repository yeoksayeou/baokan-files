　　Alone, He Captured Forty-Two Enemies
    Yan Jin
    Ji Xuecheng, this eighteen-year-old signalman, had been regretting one thing all along: "Damn it! Another empty-handed night. When can this broken rifle be replaced?" Everyone was about to go to sleep when the gunfire outside rang out. Platoon Leader Wang Fengzu shouted for everyone to get up and assemble, saying, "There are enemies on the Yellow River bank. They have already engaged our troops. Get up quickly and assemble." Ji Xuecheng, who was lying in the hay thinking about unfinished business, jumped up upon hearing the platoon leader's command, grabbed a rifle, eight grenades, and a bag of dry rations, and ran outside. Ji Xuecheng spearheaded the advance, followed by two squads. Crossing a small hill, they arrived at the riverbank, about a mile away from the village, and occupied a position. They saw a hundred or so enemies from the village creeping towards them, attempting to escape. Ji Xuecheng approached the enemy first, pulled the pin on a grenade, stared intently at the enemy, and loudly asked, "Who goes there! Which unit?" The other side didn't answer but instead asked him, "Which unit are you?" Ji Xuecheng quickly replied, "Emei troops. And you?" The enemies were terrified and no one spoke again. They turned to leave, and Ji Xuecheng chased after them. At a distance of twenty or thirty meters, he threw a grenade directly in front of them. The enemy did not counterattack but immediately lay behind an earthen slope, setting up a light machine gun, preparing to fire at him. On his flank, there were more than ten enemies attempting to take advantage of the machine gun cover to escape their misfortune. At this time, Ji Xuecheng thought he was surrounded. After a moment of confusion, he made up his mind to sacrifice himself: "Anyway, I won't survive, but I can't die in vain." Therefore, he threw the grenades more quickly and fiercely. Taking advantage of the smoke, he jumped onto the earthen ridge, then leaped up, seized the machine gun, pulled back the bolt, and aimed it at the enemy, saying, "You sons of bitches, whoever dares to move will be shot dead. Quickly surrender your guns and send one person out to line up your ranks!" He shouted in quick succession. By this time, the enemy had lost their will to fight. They formed three ranks in a horizontal line, listening to Ji Xuecheng's instructions. The resourceful Ji Xuecheng saw that the troops behind him had not yet arrived, so he shouted, "Fourth Company, provide cover. We have captured a group of prisoners here." While holding the gun on the left flank of the prisoners with a serious expression, he ordered them, "The village of Wanli ahead is the garrison of our battalion. Everyone heads towards that black pagoda!" On the way, he also did work among the prisoners, comforting them, saying, "Folks, don't be afraid. We absolutely do not kill prisoners. I was once captured by the bandit Jia Zhen and forced to be a soldier. Later, I woke up and escaped to join the Eighth Route Army. My uncle in Juan County was killed by the Central Army, and my father died of anger because of it. Now only a mother in her forties or fifties is left, fleeing for her life in Jiyuan, her life or death unknown. I want to avenge my elders. Who is willing to risk their lives to fight their own people for the Central Army? It's better to join the Eighth Route Army. If you want to go home, we will give you travel expenses. If you want to work or study, it's all up to you." His words awakened more than a dozen silent prisoners. One of the prisoners said, "We have no other thoughts. Our lives are in your hands. As long as you can show mercy, we will do as you say." Upon entering the village, the troops went to pursue the enemy, and he cleverly settled the prisoners in a courtyard to rest. He counted the number of people, a full forty-two.

　　单身俘敌四十二
    言谨
    吉学成这个十八岁的通讯员，一直在懊悔着一桩事情：“妈的！今晚又扑了一个空，这支破枪什么时候才可以换掉呢？”大家都将入睡，外面的枪声就响起了，排长王凤祖喊叫大家说：“黄河边上有敌人了，已经与咱们的队伍接了火，赶快起来集合。”吉学成躺在谷草堆里正在思想着未完成的事，听见排长的命令，跳起来拿住一支步枪、八颗手榴弹、一个干粮布袋就往外跑。吉学成一个人打了前锋，两班人亦跟踪而来，越过一个小丘，来到离湾里一里多路的河边上占领阵地，一见寨里的敌人百十来个鬼头鬼脑的迎面而来，企图逃窜，吉学成首先接近敌人，拉好手榴弹的火线，目不转睛的瞪视着敌人大声问道：“谁！那一部份？”对方没有答上，反回问他：“你是那一部份？”吉学成很快的答：“峨嵋部队，你们呢？”敌人发生恐惧再没有人说话，回头就走，吉学成随后就追，在距敌二三十公尺的地方，他便向正前方扔了一颗手榴弹，敌人没有反击，立刻躺在一个土坡背后，架起一挺轻机枪准备向他射击。在他的侧面又有十多个敌人企图借机枪的掩护来摆脱他们的恶运。吉学成这时自以为是被包围了，在他思想上经过一阵混乱后，下了牺牲的决心：“反正是活不成了，但我却不能白白的死去。”因此他更迅速更猛烈的扔出了手榴弹，趁着烟雾跃上土梁，便一跃而上抢过机枪，拉开闩对准敌人说：“狗日的那个敢动就打死谁，赶快缴枪，推一人出来排起你们的队伍！”他一连串的叫着，这时敌人已丧失了斗志，他们排成三列横队，听着吉学成的摆布。机智的吉学成看看后面队伍还没到，便一面喊着：“四连掩护，这里已经捉住一群俘虏。”一面在俘虏的左翼端着枪严肃的命令着他们：“前面湾里村就是我们大队的驻地，大家朝着那个黑塔往前走！”在路上他又向俘虏们进行工作，劝慰他们说：“老乡，不要怕，俺们绝对不杀俘虏，俺过去也是被土匪贾真一抓去当过兵的，后来觉悟过来便逃出参加了八路军。我家里的叔父在鄄县被中央军杀了，父亲因此活活气死，只剩下一个四五十岁的老娘逃难在济源，至今生死不明。我要替老人家报仇，干中央军谁愿意卖上命再打自己的人，还是投归八路军好，你们愿意回家给发路费，想工作想学习都随你们的便。”他的话把十几个不言不语的俘虏唤醒起来，其中有一人俘虏说：“俺们没有别的心思，俺的性命就在你的手里，只要你能够开恩，你说怎好就怎办。”进了村，队伍都去追击敌人，他就机智地把俘虏安置在一个院子里休息起来，他点了下人数，整整四十二个。
