　　Tense Work Behind the Taiyue Front Lines
    Preparing to Crush Chiang Kai-shek's Re-Offensive
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 8th] Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's First Division and Ninetieth Division have sneaked back into Southern Shanxi again, plotting a new offensive. Various places in Taiyue are actively preparing for war and intensifying their work to support the front lines in order to crush Chiang Kai-shek's new offensive. Workers at the Fourth Branch of the Military Commission's Explosives Factory became exceptionally agitated after listening to Staff Officer Qiao's report on the current situation. They unanimously said with indignation: "Quickly make more detonators and bombs and distribute them to the counties. If Chiang Kai-shek wants to attack, we will give those bastards more bombs to eat." Workers in each group proposed to complete the assigned tasks within half a month and also make an additional five thousand detonators. They launched a detonator-making competition, working day and night despite the severe winter. Many workers worked until dawn. The output has already exceeded that of the longer days of August by one to one and a half times. Under the leadership of district and village cadres, the liberated peasants of sixteen villages in the Fourth District of Yangcheng County voluntarily signed up to form a large stretcher team, preparing to rush to the front lines to participate in the war. The liberated peasants of Gaoping and Wangwu, recognizing that "arming ourselves is the only way to protect our homes," the peasants of Sitai Village in Gaoping raised 20,000 yuan to purchase guns, and the Youfanggou mutual aid group in the Second District of Wangwu has already bought five rifles and plans to buy three more. Currently, donation campaigns have been launched in various localities and organs. Comrades from various sections of the Taiyue-Jinan Bank District Branch donated 40,000 yuan, and 180 merchants including Han × Tai from Dayangdi, Jincheng, donated more than 30,000 yuan. More than one hundred liberated Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan military officers gathered on the 2nd of this month, unanimously expressing that they would resolutely serve the people from now on. They also voluntarily donated 4,010 yuan and wrote letters to express their sympathy to the soldiers at the front.

　　太岳前线后方紧张工作
    准备粉碎蒋军再犯
    【本报太岳八日电】蒋胡军第一师及九十师再度窜回晋南，阴谋布置新的进攻。太岳各地积极备战，并加紧工作，支援前线以粉碎蒋介石的新进攻。武委四分会爆炸工厂工人听了乔参谋的时事报告后，情绪异常紧张，一致愤慨的说：“赶快多造雷管和炸弹，分发各县。蒋介石要进攻，我们就多给王八蛋们一些炸弹吃”。各组工人提出半月内完成规定任务，还要多造五千个雷管。他们掀起造雷管竞赛，虽在严寒的冬天，仍日夜加工赶造，许多工人一直工作到鸡叫。产量已较八月天长时超过一倍至一倍半。阳城四区十六个村的翻身农民在区村干部带头下，自动报名组成一个大担架队，准备奔赴前线参战。高平、王屋翻身农民，认识“武装起来才能保家”，高平四台村农民集起两万元购买枪支，王屋二区油坊沟互助组已买好步枪五支，还要购买三支。现各地各机关已展开献金运动，太岳冀南银行区行各科同志献金四万元，晋城大阳地商人韩×泰等一百八十人献金三万余元。被解放的蒋阎军官百余人于本月二日集会，一致表示今后坚决为人民服务，亦自动献金四千零一十元，并写信慰问前方将士。
