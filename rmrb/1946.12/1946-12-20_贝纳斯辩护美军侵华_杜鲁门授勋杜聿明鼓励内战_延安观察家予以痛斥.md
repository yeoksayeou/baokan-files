　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 17th: Byrnes' defense of the U.S. military's presence in China at the UN General Assembly on the 13th is seen here in public opinion as clearly untenable. If the United States were to adopt a fair and neutral stance to curb the Chinese civil war, the Chiang Kai-shek government, which insists on dictatorial civil war, would never insist on demanding that the U.S. military be stationed in North China to help stabilize its overall situation. Observers here stated: If the U.S. military presence in China, as Byrnes said, actually helped China's democratic peace, freedom, and independence, then the United States could send troops to all independent countries in the world for the same reason, and all countries in the world could send troops to the United States for the same reason. The absurdity of this is self-evident. Observers noted: Byrnes was forced to admit this time that the U.S. military's mission in China had long been completed, but they still refused to withdraw, which thoroughly exposed the invaders from the United States and the lackeys betraying China's interests. The Chinese people and world peace-loving countries must continue their efforts, insist on the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, and insist that the United States stop fostering the Chinese civil war and infringing on China's territorial sovereignty, and will not stop until the goal is achieved.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 17th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on Truman's awarding of medals to Du Yuming and others: Truman's "supreme reward," in his position as U.S. President, to these butchers who slaughtered the Chinese people only proves that what the British media called: "Truman is the supreme commander directing the Chiang Kai-shek group to carry out the civil war" is completely accurate. According to the Tianjin Yishibao's report of a Central News Agency dispatch from Shenyang on the 3rd: Du Yuming, commander of the Northeast Chiang Kai-shek's main generals and commander of the security forces, Zheng Dongguo, deputy commander, Zhao Jiaxiang, chief of staff, and army commanders Sun Liren, Liao Yaoxiang, Zhao Gongwu, and Shi Jue "recently荣 (!) were awarded the Medal of Freedom (!) by President Truman, which was brought to Shenyang by Du Yuming." Prior to this, Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng had also received the so-called "Medal of Freedom" awarded by Truman.

　　贝纳斯辩护美军侵华
    杜鲁门授勋杜聿明鼓励内战   
    延安观察家予以痛斥
    【新华社延安十七日电】贝纳斯十三日在联合国大会关于美军驻华的辩护，此间舆论界均认为显然不能自圆其说，因美国如采取遏止中国内战的公正中立立场，则坚持独裁内战的蒋介石政府，就决不会坚持要求美军驻屯华北，以助其稳定大局。此间观察家称：如果美军驻华如贝氏所说，竟有助于中国的民主和平自由独立，则美国即可以同样理由向全世界独立国家出兵，而世界一切国家亦均可以同样理由向美国出兵，其荒廖实不辨自明。观察家称：贝氏此次被迫承认美军在华任务早已完成，而仍不撤退一节，彻底暴露了美国侵略者与中国卖国贼的理屈词穷。中国人民与世界和平国家必须再接再厉，坚持美军全部退出中国，坚持美国停止助长中国内战与侵害中国领土主权，不达目的不止。
    【新华社延安十七日电】新华社记者对杜鲁门颁给杜聿明等勋章一事评称：杜鲁门以美国总统的地位“崇高奖励”这批杀伐中国人民的屠夫，只证明英国舆论所称：“杜鲁门是指挥蒋介石集团进行内战的最高统师”的话，是完全确切。按据天津益世报载中央社沈阳三日讯：东北蒋介石的主要将领保安司令长官杜聿明、副长官郑洞国、参谋长赵家骧及军长孙立人、廖耀湘、赵公武、石觉“近曾荣（！）获杜鲁门总统所颁予之自由（！）勋章，业由杜聿明带沈”。在此前蒋介石的国防部长白崇禧、参谋总长陈诚，亦曾获得杜鲁门颁给的所谓“自由勋章”。
