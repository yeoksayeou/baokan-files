Liberated Chiang Kai-shek Soldiers
	Nine Hundred Join Our Army

[Special Dispatch] More than nine hundred liberated Chiang Kai-shek soldiers have joined our army. Chiang Kai-shek soldiers liberated in the Shangguan Village battle of the Huaxian campaign have requested to join our army one after another. Units of the 6016th Detachment held welcome meetings in their respective garrisons. In addition to preparing a rich dinner for the new comrades, the engineering company of the detachment also bought peanuts and cigarettes to entertain them. At the meeting, the new comrades scrambled to recount the suffering of being soldiers under Chiang Kai-shek and expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the benefits our army gave them. When platoon leaders Liu Xiushi, Wei Chenglin, clerk Wang Bingchen, and soldiers Lü Jinfu and others poured out the oppression and suffering they had endured in Chiang Kai-shek's New Fifth Army and Thirtieth Army, all the liberated soldiers present were extremely indignant. At the welcome meeting of the 6048th Artillery Company, Zhang Fakui, a liberated Chiang Kai-shek soldier, said, "Remembering the past at today's meeting is truly heartbreaking. I was conscripted into Chiang Kai-shek's army at the age of thirty, and I was confined and oppressed all day long. Only now have I finally seen the light."

　　被解放的蒋军士兵
    九百人参加我军
    【本报特讯】被解放的蒋军士兵又有九百余参加我军。滑县战役上官村战斗中解放过来的蒋军士兵，纷纷要求参加我军，六○一六部队各部特在驻地召开欢迎会。该部工兵连，除去给新同志准备了丰富的晚餐外，并买了花生、纸烟招待。会上新同志争着叙述跟蒋介石当兵的痛苦，对我军对他们的好处表示衷心感激。当排长刘秀石、魏成林、文书王炳辰、战士吕金福等，倾吐在蒋军新五军、三十军所受的压迫和痛苦时，全场被解放的士兵都激愤异常。在六○四八炮兵连欢迎会上，被解放的蒋军士兵张发奎说：“今天会上想起过去的事真是痛心。三十年被抓来当蒋介石的兵，成天被关闭着，受尽压迫，现在才算出头了。”
