The Transformation of Landlord "Blind Fourth"
　　Jinan Branch
"Blind Fourth is really capable!" This admiring remark spread throughout the streets and alleys of Shengfo Temple in Wei County. Upon inquiring, the reporter learned that "Blind Fourth" was a reformed landlord. Initially, his father engaged in usury, lending nine and collecting ten, with a 50% interest rate. During the ninth year of the Republic of China (a great famine), he took advantage of the situation, seizing over ten *qing* of land from the masses, employing four long-term laborers and eight tenant farmers. "Blind Fourth" did nothing but smoke opium and demand wine from his debtors at the market, squandering a considerable amount of his family's wealth. Even his wife lacked confidence in growing old with him.

When the reporter visited him, he saw rows of mustard greens and red radishes planted in the courtyard, and piles of gathered dry artemisia. In a sun-facing tile-roofed house, a large donkey was eating grass by the new millstone, and new steamed bun-making tools were hung on the wall. Shortly after the reporter arrived, he came in carrying two brooms, chewing on a dry cornbread and said, "Saving a meal at the meeting, I bought two brooms." When the reporter asked to interview him, he said, "After dinner, I'll go to Xue Village to buy *tang gazi* (fried dough sticks) and we'll talk when I get back." After dinner, the reporter walked to his house in the moonlight and saw his wife carding cotton under the cotton oil lamp, while he was counting in front of an empty basket: "Quan Gui owes three hundred again, Lan Yu five hundred, ......" After reciting them, he said smugly: "My accounts are in my belly, I recite them every day, this is the skill the Eighth Route Army gave me." When the conversation turned to his past, he said: "When I was a landlord before, I only associated with bandits and thieves, and I didn't dare sleep at night. Later, when the Eighth Route Army came, I found them annoying. Once, the puppet army attacked my village from Xige Village, and Lao Ge (the captain of the County Guerrilla 7th Brigade) who was staying at my house, led his troops to victory, capturing a large number of puppet soldiers and seizing many weapons, and my two cattle and belongings were preserved. From this time on, I knew the Eighth Route Army was good."

He continued: "During the great famine of 1932, the land was sold out, and the whole family was scattered. I sold my wife and two younger children to Yucheng, and my eldest son got lost while begging for food in Gaotang. I went to Jin County to beg for food. After returning home in October, I heard that the government had a decree to redeem the land, so I sold an empty house and redeemed a courtyard with a house. I sold a room and a pair of second gates for 7,000 yuan, and invested 4,000 yuan in the cooperative. I heard others say, "A wife who was separated during the famine can still be called back." So I took 3,000 yuan for travel expenses to find my wife, and also found my eldest son in Gaotang. The whole family was reunited on October 24th. Later, I redeemed eight *mu* of land. Last year, after rent and interest reduction, the peasants only asked me to repay for a courtyard house. When the mutual aid team was established in the spring, they persuaded me to join, but I couldn't accept the idea. After Commissar Zhang's repeated persuasion, I reluctantly joined the plowing team. The government lent me four *jin* of cotton and fifty *jin* of mung beans, and my enthusiasm increased a bit. I plowed during the day and ground soybeans at night, and let my wife sell pancakes during the day." Speaking of this, "Blind Fourth" felt even more grateful for the democratic government, and he said, "There was no food to eat when plowing, and the village warehouse allocated me over one hundred *jin* of wheat. In order to support me in making steamed buns, the village cooperative gave me a millstone worth 4,000 yuan and let me have a big donkey first for 5,000 yuan." He also said that he earned more money, and he bought cattle with others, and joined the mutual aid team with more than ten *mu* of land. Talking about his winter production plan, he said: "In addition to the steamed bun business, I also sell *gazi*, peanuts, my eldest son gathers firewood, my second son looks after the children when he comes back from school, and his mother spends some time doing more needlework. I also accumulate bran from selling steamed buns to raise pigs, and next year I will buy half a donkey for 5,600 yuan. I bought a large vat so my children can learn to open a vermicelli shop in the future." Finally, he pointed to the three new quilts on the *kang* and said, "Look, this is what hard work brings. I used to eat whatever was good, wear whatever was expensive, and do whatever was easy, but now it's different from before." His wife interjected: "The Eighth Route Army made him quit opium, and after living a lifetime, I finally feel at ease."

　　地主四瞎子的转变
    冀南分社
    “四瞎子真能干!”这种羡慕的话语传遍了威县圣佛堂的大街小巷。记者一打听，才知道四瞎子是改造了的地主。起初他父亲放高利贷，九当十，五分利息。民国九年（大灾荒）他趁火打劫，夺了群众土地十来顷，家里有四个长工，八个佃户。四瞎子除吸白面，到集上见了债户要酒吃，没有事情干，家当败坏了不少。他老婆也没有信心跟他过到老。
    当记者访问他时，见院内种着一畦一畦的芥菜、红萝卜，堆满了拾来的干蒿子。一座朝阳的瓦屋内，一头大驴在新磨边吃草，墙上挂着新的蒸馍器具。记者到他家不久，他拿着两把扫帚走来，嚼着干窝窝说：“到会上省了顿饭，买了两把扫帚”。当记者约他谈话时，他说：“晚饭后我到薛庄买糖＠子（油条），回来谈吧。”晚饭吃过点把钟，记者踏着月影走到他家，见他老婆正在棉油灯下搓棉絮，他在空＠子篮前数着：“全贵又欠三百，兰玉五百，……………”背完后，他得意的说：“我的账在肚皮里，每天念一遍，这是八路军给我的本事呀。”扯到他的过去，他说：“我从前是地主时，光给土匪、小偷打来往，夜夜不敢睡。后来八路军来了，我看见也烦。有一次皇协军从西格村向我村打来，在我家住的老葛（县游击七大队队长）带着队伍打了胜仗，俘了大批伪军，缴了很多枪枝，我的两头牛和东西都保住了。从这次才知道八路军不错。
    他接着说：“三十二年大灾荒，地卖光，全家失散了。把老婆和二小卖到禹城，我大儿因要饭失迷在高唐，我到锦县要饭。十月回家后，听政府有赎庄地法令，把一座空宅卖了，赎回一座带房的院子，把一个屋子和一对二门卖了七千元，四千元入了合作社。听别人说：“灾荒年失散的老婆还可叫回。”于是拿三千元路费找回老婆，到高唐也找到了大儿，十月二十四日全家团圆了。后来又赎回八亩地，去年减租减息，农民们只要我偿还了一座院房。开春互助组成立起来，他们劝我参加互助组，我打不通思想，后经张政委再三的劝说，当时勉强参加了拉犁。政府贷我四斤棉絮，五十斤绿豆，我的劲头大了些，白天拉犁，夜间磨豆子，白天让老婆卖煎饼。”谈到这里，四瞎子更想起民主政府的恩泽来，他说：“拉犁没粮吃，村仓库曾拨给我一百多斤麦，为了支持我干馍馍坊，村合作社四千元算给我一盘磨，五千元先尽我要了一头大驴”。他又说赚的钱多了，他又与别人伙买了牛，带着十来亩地参加了互助组。谈到他的冬季生产计划时，他说：“除了馍馍坊，另外我还卖＠子、花生，大儿拾柴，二儿下学回来看孩，腾些工夫他娘多做些针线，还凭卖馍馍积下麸子，养个猪，到明年再买半个驴，五千六买了个大缸，将来让孩子学开粉坊”。最后他指着炕上的三条新被子说：“你看，这是勤劳换来的。我以先啥好吃啥，啥贵穿啥，啥轻干啥，现在可和先前不一样了。”他老婆插上一句说：“八路管着他戒了白面，我过了一辈子，这才把心放在肚里了”。
