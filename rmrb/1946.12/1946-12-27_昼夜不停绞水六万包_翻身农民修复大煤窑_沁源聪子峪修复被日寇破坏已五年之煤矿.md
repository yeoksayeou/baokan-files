[This dispatch comes from] Taiyue, 24th. After the peasants of Qinyuan Congziyu were liberated, their enthusiasm for production was particularly high. All the peasants cooperated and helped each other to restore the large coal mine that had been destroyed by the Japanese invaders five years ago. Congziyu Village originally had a large coal mine. Thirty years ago, one-seventh of the 498 people in the village's 120 households depended on it for their livelihood. In October of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e. 1942], it was devastated by the Japanese invaders. The seven-zhang-deep mine shaft was filled with water, and the mine collapsed and stopped working. This year, due to early frost, the crops in Congziyu were poor, and the self-defense war also required the restoration of the Nan Jing [South Well] mine to overcome the famine and support the front. All the peasants in the village started work on September 26th. Workers Shi Weiyuan, Song Xiao'er, Ai Piaozi, Bai Xiulin, and others worked daily in the two-chi-deep muddy water in the well. Forty-four liberated peasants formed eleven teams, and they set up wheels every day to bail water non-stop, day and night, rain or shine. After 22 days of hard work, they started producing coal on October 16th, using a total of 640 workdays and bailing out 64,000 bundles of water. The liberated peasants couldn't close their mouths from smiling and said: "We can burn coal from Nan Jing mine again! Today, if Chiang Kai-shek, that bastard, wants to destroy it again, we will fight him to the end." In order to expand production, a new method of increasing shares and drawing dividends has been determined, stipulating that fifteen workdays constitute one share. In addition to the share workers, those who do extra work earn wages, and cutting one piece of coal earns eight he of millet. A good hand can cut more than 20 pieces a day, earning two sheng of millet. Pulling one piece of coal earns one he and eight shao of millet, and water bailers earn seven sheng of millet per day, while each water carrier earns six sheng of millet. Since the implementation of the incentive method, the enthusiasm of the workers has greatly increased, from four people cutting and two people pulling to ten people cutting and three people pulling. The daily coal output has increased to more than 180 pieces, and 1,630 pieces have been produced, which can buy 81 shi of corn. There are many people and carts pulling coal, no less than 40 vehicles a day, like a small fair.
