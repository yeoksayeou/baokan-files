　　The Enemy Refused to Surrender and Was Resolutely Eliminated
     ——Annihilation of the Chiang Army in Huangzhuang
    After the Chiang army's 47th Division, 125th Brigade, and 374th Regiment occupied Wangjiazhai, Caoqiying, Kongcun, Huangzhuang and other villages and towns southeast of Hua County, they rushed to build strong fortifications. Outside the寨wall of the Huangzhuang regimental headquarters there was a particularly strong cheval-de-frise, further out was a trench more than ten feet wide and deep, the third line was wooden planks, and the fourth line was a water-filled ditch more than ten feet wide and deep. When the counterattack war of our army in Hua County began, the nearby Chiang armies gathered in Huangzhuang, attempting to hold on. Not long after the battle began, the entire 104th Brigade of the 41st Division, the 125th Brigade headquarters and one regiment, and He Guansan's Security 12th Corps successively laid down their weapons, leaving the 374th Regiment headquarters and two battalions still holding Huangzhuang. On the 21st of last month, our army wrote a letter劝them to withdraw from the civil war, but received no response. Our army then tried to win them over by shouting, which can be described as "utmost benevolence and righteousness." However, the leaders of the 374th Regiment remained stubbornly ignorant. They do not understand that any strong village fortifications cannot stop the strong will of the People's Liberation Army. At 10 p.m. on the 23rd, hundreds of cannons, large and small, of our army thundered, and in just 30 minutes, the brave soldiers had broken through the southeast and northwest corner fortifications of the village, climbed the寨walls, and drove the Chiang army to the northeast corner of the village. At 12 o'clock, the commander of the 374th Regiment, Chen Xiaowen, and more than 800 officers and soldiers were all taken prisoner, and more than 200 other officers and soldiers were sacrificed for Chiang Kai-shek's policy of selling out the country and waging civil war. When the reporter met Chen Xiaowen on the battlefield, he expressed extreme shame, feeling that if he had accepted the Eighth Route Army's advice to withdraw from the civil war earlier, these many brothers would not have suffered unnecessary sacrifices.

　　敌人不投降坚决消灭他
     ——黄庄蒋军被歼记
    蒋军四十七师一二五旅三七四团占领滑县东南王家寨、曹七营、孔村、黄庄等村镇后，即赶筑强固工事。黄庄团部驻地寨墙外面是特别强固的鹿砦，再靠外是丈多宽深的壕沟，第三道是木板，第四道是丈多宽深的水沟。当滑县我军反击战开始后，附近的蒋军都集结在黄庄，企图固守。战斗开始不久，四十一师一○四旅全部，一二五旅旅部和一个团及何冠三保安十二总队相继放下武器，剩下三七四团团部和两个营依然固守黄庄。上月二十一日我军曾写一封信劝他们退出内战，没有回音，我军又以喊话争取，可谓“仁至义尽”了，而三七四团的首脑，仍执迷不悟。他们不了解任何强固村工事，是阻挡不住人民解放军坚强的意志的。二十三日夜十时，我军百门大小炮惊天动地的响起来了，三十分钟光景，勇士们已冲破村东南角、西北角工事，登上寨墙，把蒋军驱逐到村东北角。十二时三七四团团长陈筱文以下八百多个官兵全作了俘虏，另有二百多官兵为蒋介石卖国内战政策作了牺牲品。记者在战地上会见陈筱文时，他表示万分惭愧，觉得如果及早接受八路军的劝告退出内战，也不会使这许多弟兄遭无谓的牺牲。（丁曼）
