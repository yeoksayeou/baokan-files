Opening the Prison Gates
    ——A Brief Account of the Liberation of Yuanqu

The cessation of flying shrapnel and brief gunfire brought not terror but a surge of tense excitement through the bodies of the peasants long imprisoned in this hell. The prisoners secretly blessed, "We have won!" Among them were peasants who had turned over a new leaf, persecuted by reactionary landlords for settling accounts, and farmers loyal to their land, branded as "traitors" by Chiang Kai-shek. Within the 27-foot-high stockade walls and dark cellars, they discussed the commotion outside, and the sounds of agitation arose within as well. Soldier Zhang Bingfa, while climbing the wall, heard these sounds and mistakenly thought they were hidden Chiang soldiers. Delighted, he thought, "Perhaps I can capture a few prisoners," and quickly ran down, shouting, "Lay down your arms and you will not be killed!" But in response came, "Quick, save us! We are civilians captured by the stubborn enemy!" Zhang Bingfa’s joy was momentarily dashed by the large lock on the prison gate, but he soon cheered up again, realizing this was an even more valuable accomplishment than capturing prisoners. He fiercely gripped the lock, trying to twist it open, but the heavy lock remained hanging firmly on the prison door. Anxiously and forcefully, he lifted a large stone and desperately smashed it against the lock. With a "thud," the door fell, and a foul odor rushed out from the windows. Then, a group of pale, emaciated people walked out and stood before him. Some wordlessly gripped the soldier's hands, tears dripping from their sunken eyes onto the soldier’s clothes. Zhang Bingfa was stunned, unsure of what to say to comfort them. After a long while, he noticed that the prisoners’ feet were still shackled. He hurriedly found an axe and began smashing the fetters one by one, destroying twenty-seven pairs of shackles. His heart felt lighter. Soldier Li Baoen saw that some of them were still wearing only thin clothing and shivering, so he turned and ran back to fetch a coat, hastily draping it over one of them. Other soldiers busied themselves fetching dry rations, stuffing steamed buns into the prisoners' arms. The farmers felt an unprecedented warmth. A disheveled female prisoner from Luotuo Kiln said she had come to Yuanqu city to buy oil, but the tyrannical and unreasonable Chiang soldiers had insisted she was a Communist spy, imprisoning and humiliating her. She resentfully denounced the Chiang soldiers’ unreasonableness, saying, "The damned Chiang Kai-shek only knows how to oppress the people!" A peasant from Gaoluo who had turned over a new leaf had his entire family seized and imprisoned, and they were also rescued. He gratefully wanted to go to our army headquarters to express his thanks. Finally, all twenty-seven people happily said, "We knew the Eighth Route Army would not forget us…"

　　打开狱门
    ——解放垣曲散记
    停止了弹片的横飞与短促的枪声，给久囚在这狱里的农民，带来的不是恐怖而是遍体血液的紧张沸腾，囚徒的心里在暗暗的祝福“咱们胜利了！”这里边是被反动地主倒算迫害的翻身农民及被蒋介石指为“叛徒”的忠实于自已土地的庄稼人，他们在廿七人高的寨墙里，黑暗的地窑里，谈着外面的骚动，里面也传起了骚动的声音，战士张炳发正爬到墙头上，听到了这声音，他误会是藏着的蒋军，喜欢的想：“这可能捉几个俘虏”，就飞快的跑下去高喊着：“缴枪不杀你！”可是相反的即传出来“快快救命吧！我们是被顽固抓来的老百姓呀！”张炳发欢喜的心立刻被牢门的大锁冲散了，但是不一会又高兴起来，这是比俘虏更可贵的功劳，他就狠狠的握着大锁，要一下拧开它，可是大锁还是重甸甸的挂在牢门上，他着急而有力的搬起一块大石头，没命的砥过去，“扑的”一声，门倒下去，扑鼻的臭气便从窗门里冲出来，接着一群苍白饥瘦的人走出来站在他的面前，有些人一声不响的握紧了战士的手，在那深陷的眼睛里，泪水一点一滴的滚到战士的衣襟上，张炳发呆了，不知该说什么话来安慰他们，好久好久，才发现囚徒们的脚上还锁着脚镣，他急忙找了个斧子，一付一付的敲毁了，打碎了二十七付脚镣，他心上轻松了。战士李保恩又看见他们中有人还穿着单衣，在索索发抖，就转身跑回去取了件大衣来，忙披在那人身上。又有些战士忙着去取干粮，把馍向囚徒们怀里塞，庄稼人感到从来未有的温暖。骆驼窑的一个麻头垢面的女囚徒，她说她是到垣曲城来买油的，横暴无理的蒋军，硬说她是八路军的探子，被囚起来遭受侮辱，她愤恨蒋军的无理说：“天杀的蒋介石，只会欺压老百姓！”皋落的一个翻身农民全家被抓到监牢里，也救出来了，他感激的要到我军指挥部酬。谢最后二十七个人终于高兴的说：“我们知道八路军不会忘记我们的………。”
