　　[Report from this newspaper in Wu'an] Wang Dazhuang, a special-class labor hero from Hulei Mountain in the Fifth District, absorbed disabled people into production. Disabled people with missing eyes or legs have achieved self-sufficiency. For example, Wang Shuanhe, a demobilized soldier with only one arm, did not engage in production last year. After eating the six dou of grain harvested from his land and the 800 jin of rice provided by the government as preferential treatment, he still owed 10,000 yuan. This year, Wang Dazhuang organized him into a mutual aid group and exchanged labor with others according to his ability. Because he could not till the land with one hand, he helped others carry manure, do errands, lead livestock, and hoe the ground. As a result of a year's labor, his five mu of land yielded two shi and three dou of grain and over 100 jin of cotton without hiring a single worker. Another example is Wang Lao Si, who is blind in one eye. His wife also has only one arm, and they have two children, rendering them unable to engage in production. Consequently, despite having four mu of sloping land, they were constantly begging for food and clothing. After joining Wang Dazhuang's mutual aid group last year, the group lent them grain and helped them find work. He carried manure for others, and others hoed the ground for him. This year, they harvested three shi of grain and 50 jin of cotton, plus earned 12,000 yuan from picking, chopping, and odd jobs, enough to feed the whole family for the year. The village has poor soil, and in good years, one mu of land yields less than seven dou of coarse grain. Last year, due to uneven droughts and floods, the grain harvest was not enough to meet the village's consumption. However, under Wang Dazhuang's leadership, 100% of the farmers have been organized, not only overcoming the famine but also achieving a surplus this year, with "cultivating three, surplus one." (Li Yaonan)
    [Report from this newspaper in Licheng] Songhou Village in the Fourth District is a small mountain village with poor soil. In the past, the masses ate chaff and wild vegetables. This year, under the leadership of hero Wu Quanxi, they proposed the slogan "Rely on the mountain to eat from the mountain," organizing sideline production of herb digging. The entire village achieved "cultivating two, surplus one." Because his village is scattered in a mountain gully of four or five li, he gets up early to organize labor for digging herbs. He organized four groups, with 76 people digging over two million jin of herbs, earning over 200,000 yuan. He organized children to dig, earning 1,500 yuan. He also organized people to transport and sell them in Ren Village, bringing back cotton and salt, earning over 180,000 yuan, providing raw materials for women's spinning and weaving, spinning a total of 725 jin of cotton, earning a net profit of over 190,000 yuan. He processed codonopsis pilosula, earning over 500,000 yuan. In ten months, they earned over one million yuan in total. Another matter most supported by the masses is that his village has eleven female donkeys, and he has one male donkey. He does not charge for mating, resulting in the birth of eleven foals in the village. (Chongqi, Shuanjing)

    吴金喜组织刨药赚洋百万
    【本报武安讯】五区忽雷山特等劳动英雄王大庄，吸收残废人参加生产，少眼没腿的残废人，都已达到了自给自足。如荣退军人王拴和，只有一个胳膊，去年因自己不生产，除把地里打的六斗粮食和公家优待的八百斤米吃完外，还欠下一万块钱债。今年王大庄把他组织到互助组里，按他的能力和别人换工，他一只手不能耕地，就帮别人担粪、支差、牵牲口、锄地。一年劳动结果，他的五亩地没雇一个工就收了两石三斗粮和一百多斤棉花。又如瞅蒙眼王老四，自己眼不好，老婆又是一个胳膊连上两个小孩都不能生产，因而虽有四亩坡地，却常年讨吃讨穿。去年参加王大庄互助组后，组里借粮给他并和他拚兑营生，他给别人担粪，别人给他锄地，今年收了三石粮、五十斤花，加上拾砍打短工赚洋一万二千元，够全年全家人的食用。该村石厚土薄，好年景一亩地也打不了七斗粗粮，去年由于旱涝不均，收粮不够全村消耗。但在王大庄领导下，农民已百分之百的组织起来，不仅战胜了饥荒，并且今年还做到了耕三余一。（李耀南）
    【本报黎城讯】松后村是四区一个石厚土薄的山河小村，往年群众都是吃糠咽菜，今年在英雄吴全喜的领导下提出了“靠山吃山”的口号，组织搞副业刨药材，全村做到了耕二余一。因他村是分散在一个四五里的山沟，他搭黑起早跑到各户组织劳力刨药材，组织起四个小组，七十六个人刨药材二百多万斤，赚洋二十余万元。组织儿童刨，赚一千五百元。又组织人到任村运卖，往回驮棉花食盐，赚洋十八万多元，也给妇女纺织有了原料，共纺花七百二十五斤，净赚十九万多元，压党参赚洋五十余万元，十个月共赚一百余万元。还有件群众最拥护的事，是他村有十一头母驴，他有一头公驴，在交配时不要报酬，结果全村下了十一头小驴。（崇奇、拴竟）
