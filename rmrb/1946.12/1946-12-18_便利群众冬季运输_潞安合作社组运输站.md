　　Facilitating Winter Transportation for the Masses
    Luan Cooperative Establishes Transportation Stations
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] In order to develop winter transportation, the Luan General Cooperative is using local products such as iron, magnetite, and hemp to exchange for cotton, cloth, livestock, and tools. They have established transfer stations in seven locations: Yincheng, Changzhi City, Licheng City, Henan Dian in She County, and Yetao in Wu'an, all on the Handan-Changzhi main line, as well as in Handan and Xingtai, to facilitate mass transportation. In addition, on the Jin-Yu Avenue, the Huguan County Cooperative has established a transfer station in Hejian. On the Zuoquan-Changzhi Avenue, the Xiangyuan County Cooperative has established a transfer station in Hongshui to develop transportation. They have also dispatched strong and capable cadres to work at the transportation stations, responsible for purchasing goods on behalf of the masses, soliciting return trips, and providing accommodation for people and livestock, thus greatly facilitating the transportation for the masses. This greatly benefits weak livestock and people carrying burdens who are unable to participate in long-distance transportation.

　　便利群众冬季运输
    潞安合作社组运输站
    【本报长治讯】潞安合作总社，为发展今冬运输，拿本区所产的铁、磁、麻等，换回棉花、布、牲口及工具等，特在邯长主干线上之荫城、长治市、黎城城内、涉县河南店、武安冶陶，以及邯郸、邢台七处设立转运栈，便利群众运输。此外，在晋豫大道上，壶关县联社于河涧设立转运栈。左长大路上，襄垣县联社于洪水设立转运栈，以发展运输，并派强有力干部到运输栈工作，负责给群众代推代购货物，揽来回脚，留人留牲口，便利群众运输起火。这样不能参加长途运输的弱牲口及人担挑，都有很大便利。
