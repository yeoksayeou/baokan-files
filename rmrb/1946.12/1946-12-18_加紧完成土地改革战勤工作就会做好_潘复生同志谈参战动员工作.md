(Reported by our newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 14th) Comrade Pan Fusheng, Deputy Political Commissar of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, spoke to reporters a few days ago about how to do a good job in war mobilization work. He said: War support must be combined with regular work, and leaders must take the initiative to go into rural areas and solve problems. In the past, war support was treated as a "one-off deal." At the county level, there were war preparations, war support, land reform, and a Yellow River task. How could the leadership proceed in an orderly manner? Today, we must oppose only rushing through one task and then dropping it, because, in fact, rush work cannot be completed without a foundation of regular work. We must complete all these tasks and must take the initiative so we can be prepared to provide support whenever it is needed. Organizationally, we must establish command posts at all levels, and within the Party committee itself, there must be a scientific division of labor. Rewards and punishments must be clear, and it must be clearly discussed who should go on business trips. Deputy Political Commissar Pan continued: Not only must the tasks be completed, but there must also be good methods and approaches. We must emphasize in-depth mobilization, and when inspecting the work, we must always ask "How was it completed, and what were the methods and approaches?" The method of calculating work points for war support in Dong Huwang Village, Qingfeng County, should be adhered to. Mobilize the villages to discuss democratically how to implement it, and then concentrate the results. The county should conduct a comprehensive study, which is very good leadership. The leadership method lies in discovering problems and solving problems. To do a good job in war support, the fundamental issue is to mobilize the masses. (1) Deepen leadership, oppose bureaucracy, and mobilize the masses, which is the combination of land reform and war support. As long as the immediate problems of the masses are solved, the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses will be there. (2) Solve the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the relationship between village cadres and the masses, but it is by no means just about self-reflection, but mainly about solving problems, admitting mistakes, such as compensating for losses, and if the distribution of fruits is unfair, it must be persuaded and redistributed; if someone has embezzled, they must take it out and redistribute it. After solving the immediate interests of the masses, it is also necessary to raise political awareness. After solving the above problems, we can do a good job in war mobilization.

　　加紧完成土地改革战勤工作就会做好
    潘复生同志谈参战动员工作
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】日前冀鲁豫军区潘复生副政委对记者谈：如何做好参战动员工作。他说：战勤要和经常工作结合起来，领导必须争取主动，下决心深入农村解决问题。过去战勤是“一盘子端”，县里是备战、战勤、土地改革，还有一个黄河任务，领导上如何有秩序的进行呢？今天我们要反对只会突击一个丢一个，事实上，突击工作没有经常工作作基础就完成不了。我们这些任务都要完成，只有争取主动，所以必须把战勤工作放在经常工作上，准备好随时来随时给。在组织上要把各级指挥部建立起来，在党委本身要科学分工，必须作到偿罚严明，明确讨论谁该出差。潘副政委继称：任务不仅要完成，还要有好的方法方式，要强调深入动员，检查工作时，一定要问“怎样完成的，方法方式怎样？”清丰董胡王村战勤计工办法要坚持下去，发动各村民主讨论，如何执行，要集中上来，县里加以综合研究，这就是很好的领导。领导方法就在于发现问题，解决问题。战勤工作要作好，基本问题是发动群众。（一）深入领导，反对官僚主义，发动群众，就是土地改革和战勤结合。只要解决群众切身问题，群众创造性和积极性就有了。（二）解决党与群众关系、村干与群众关系，但决不是光反省，主要是解决问题，承认错误，如赔偿损失，分果实分的不公，一定要说服与重新分；贪污了的要拿出来重新分。群众的切身利益解决了，还要提高政治觉悟。解决了以上问题，就可以把参战动员做好。
