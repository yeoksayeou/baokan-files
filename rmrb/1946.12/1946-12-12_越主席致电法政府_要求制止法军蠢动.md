    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. Vietnam News Agency published on the 7th an urgent telegram from the Chairman of the Vietnamese government, Ho Chi Minh, to the French Parliament and government, demanding that the French Parliament and government immediately stop the French authorities in Vietnam from undermining the Vietnam-France Agreement, mobilizing land, sea, and air forces to attack the Haiphong-Lang Son line, and order them to restore their positions before November 20th. Ho Chi Minh condemned the French High Commissioner in Vietnam, D'Argenlieu, for openly stating in a recent speech that he would use force to restore his rule in Vietnam, pointing out that this statement has caused great anger among the Vietnamese people. Ho Chi Minh also denounced the French authorities in Vietnam for spreading rumors aimed at undermining the friendly relations between the people of France and Vietnam. The telegram demanded that the French government make a prompt decision and not allow the situation to continue to develop. According to the United Press, overseas Chinese who escaped from Haiphong said that the French army bombarded the overseas Chinese residential areas with fierce artillery fire when attacking the Vietnamese side, causing heavy casualties and property losses, with as many as 3,000 people homeless.

    越主席致电法政府
    要求制止法军蠢动
    【新华社延安九日电】越南通讯社七日发表越南政府主席胡志明致法国议会及政府的紧急通电，要求法议会及政府立即制止越南境内法国当局破坏越法协定动员陆海空军攻击海防至凉山一线的行动，令其恢复十一月二十日以前的阵地。胡志明谴责法驻越高级专员达根留在最近演说中公开表示要以武力恢复其在越南的统治，指出此一声明已在越南人民间引起极大愤怒。胡志明又斥驻越法当局散布谣言，旨在破坏法越两国人民之友谊关系。该电要求法政府当机立断，勿听事态继续发展下去。又据合众社引海防逃出之华侨称：法军在攻击越方时以猛烈炮火轰击华侨住区，人命财产损失极众，无家可归者达三千人。
