The room is tidy. Six knapsacks hang in a row on the north wall, with a row of hand grenades below them. Six rifles stand against the east wall. Acting Platoon Leader Wang Keqin is packing a knapsack for a new comrade in the Third Squad, patting the quilt and tightening the rope. "Pack it this tightly." He hands the packed knapsack to another soldier: "You'll stay here." Seeing Wang Keqin's care for the new soldiers, the reporter says admiringly, "Platoon Leader Wang is very concerned about the new comrades!" "It's nothing. The new comrades have just arrived and aren't familiar with anything. I often tell them that at home you rely on your parents, but in the revolution, you rely on mutual assistance."

He turns to look at the soldiers packing their knapsacks on the bed, and talks about his time in the First Squad:

"It was raining that day. I got some firewood to dry their clothes, and Deputy Squad Leader Tao Wuying went to boil water. As soon as the four new comrades, Du Shuangjian, Bai Zhixue, Yang Xuebao, and Lu Dingkun, entered the door, the veteran comrades grabbed their hands and said, 'We've been waiting for so long, hurry and rest.' After eating, the clothes were dry, and we prepared to depart. I told the veteran comrades to let them carry everything, and to help the new comrades along the way. We walked all night, and at dawn, we found two bags of fried noodles and shared them with the new comrades, without giving any to the veteran comrades.

"It was all mud roads for eighty li. This was their first time, and no one fell behind.

"The new comrades didn't understand anything and were afraid to speak. I told the whole squad to give collective reports every day. The first time, I introduced myself first: I'm from Fuyang, Anhui, a family of three, with three mu of land, and my family is poor. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, I was conscripted into the Central Army, and I was only liberated last year during the Ping-Han Campaign. After that, I realized that the Central Army worked for the rich, and the Eighth Route Army was for the people. After hearing this, everyone spoke, all of them had been exploited.

"Lu Shoukūn has a 'hot' temper, Du Shuangjian is impatient, Yang Xuebao is silent, and Bai Zhixue goes to bed as soon as he leaves the training ground, his mood is low. I talked to him twice, but he always shook his head. One day, I went to the company headquarters and wrote him a letter home, and then called Du Shuangjian over and said, 'You two are from the same hometown, talk to him, you can solve his problem.' Ten minutes later, they both came together and said, 'The squad leader and the veteran comrades are so good to me, I will definitely work hard from today on.'"

"It was wartime. In training, I couldn't start by lecturing on theory and having them memorize empty terms. We first learned how to disassemble the five major parts. On the first day, they watched, and on the second day, they learned how to aim and troubleshoot. They learned it in only five days. In the last two days, we practiced using terrain to dig fortifications and various movements under enemy fire. I was relieved. Now I can do something.

"The day before the battle, after the company's mobilization, we returned to the squad and organized mutual aid groups, electing Du Shuangjian and Zhao Qingnian as group leaders. The first group was Zhao Qingnian, Bai Zhixue, Yang Xuebao, and me. Everyone set their battle plans. The next morning, we entered the battle. This was the first task after the new comrades arrived. 'Dig fortifications, sweat more, bleed less. We are here to kill the enemy, not to be killed by the enemy.' This was the first time I gave them an order, and their actions were very quick. In less than ten minutes, both groups had finished digging.

"Du Shuangjian's light machine gun was covering the heavy machine gun, and my turntable was acting as mobile firepower. 'First Squad Leader! The enemy is coming from the southwest road, half the village is surrounded, take your machine gun to cooperate with the Second Platoon!' The company commander ordered me. 'First Group, run!' I gave the second order.

"'Use firepower, kill the enemy, choose your own positions.' The Second Platoon Leader gave the task. We found good positions in a courtyard, and the four of us worked together to build fortifications. Yang Xuebao was monitoring the enemy in the gun slit, and Bai Zhixue was squatting under a big tree. The enemy started firing artillery, and planes were flying overhead. Bai Zhixue and Yang Xuebao were digging shelters in the middle of the yard. This time I was testing their courage, but they were dug in only five minutes.

"The enemy started charging, and a shell landed on the position. 'Lie down quickly!' As soon as I heard the shell being fired, I told them how to hide. The enemy was getting closer. 'As soon as my machine gun fires, you go into the fortifications, the enemy knows there's a machine gun here and will fire artillery.' I took the machine gun and fired, Zhao Qingnian was lying on the ground loading bullets. 'Let me come out and fight too!' Bai Zhixue asked me. 'Go to the right to monitor the enemy.' 'Squad leader, don't worry.' He looked at me, often turning his head to look at him. 'The enemy is about to charge!' Yang Xuebao, who was monitoring the enemy on the left, reported to everyone. The enemy charged in front of the position, and the mutual aid group used hand grenades to drive them back. We then received orders to cooperate with the Third Squad in defending the bunker on the north side of the street. Yang Xuebao looked straight at the east gun slit, Bai Zhixue monitored the west gun slit, and Zhao Qingnian was responsible for liaison. I aimed my gun at the enemy outside the south end, and shot down two, and the other enemies didn't dare to show their heads again. But Bai Zhixue reported that he heard enemies talking in the houses on the south side of the street, and Zhao Qingnian reported to the Third Squad's Third Squad. The wall of the house on the south side of the street was destroyed, and the enemies were eliminated.

"The sun was setting, and the enemy's charge was beaten back. But the artillery fire was even tighter. Only two houses, east and west, remained in the whole village. A shell collapsed the west house, and an old woman was crying in the house: 'Squad leader! Let me get the old woman out!' Bai Zhixue pulled her out and brought her out a jar of noodles.

"The Second Group held their position and protected the heavy machine gun. More than twenty shells landed around their position. The enemy charged at the position several times, but they were all beaten back. The machine gun was fired by Du Shuangjian alone, and Tao Wuying and Lu Shoukūn took turns monitoring the enemy and responsible for liaison. We completed the task without any casualties. Bai Zhixue and Du Shuangjian became combat heroes. This was the first time. I became acting platoon leader after this battle."

    王克勤班
    乃一
    房子是整洁的，六个挂包并列在北墙上，下面是一排手榴弹，东墙根立着六支步枪。代理排长王克勤在给三班的新同志捆背包，按按被子紧紧绳子。“照这个样捆结实”。他把捆好的背包交给另外一个战士：“你就住这里”。看到王克勤对新战士的爱护，记者敬佩的说道：“王排长对新同志很关心！”“没什么，新同志刚来，什么都不熟，我常对他们谈在家靠父母，革命靠互助”。
    他回头看看在床上捆背包的战士，谈起住在第一班时的情形：
    “那天下雨，我拿些柴火，准备给他们烤衣服，副班长陶武英去烧开水。四个新同志：杜双建、白志学、杨学保、卢定坤一进门，老同志就拉住他们的手说：“我们等了半天，快休息吧。”吃完饭，衣服干了，准备出发，我告诉老同志东西全要他们拿，在路上还要帮助新同志。走了一夜，天亮时，找了两口袋炒面分给新同志吃，老同志一点没给。
    “八十里全是泥路，这是第一次呀，没有一个掉队的。
    “新同志什么都不了解，话也不敢说，我叫全班每天集体汇报，第一次我先介绍自己：我是安徽阜阳人，三口人，三亩地，家里贫苦。民国三十年被中央军抓去当兵，去年平汉战役才被解放过来。以后我了解了中央军是给有钱人干的，八路军才是为老百姓。他们听了，每个人都发了言，全是受剥削的。
    “卢守坤是‘肉脾’气，杜双建急性子，杨学保不言不语，白志学下了操场就上床睡觉，情绪不高，找他谈两次话，总是摇头。一天到连部，给他写了封家信，又把杜双建叫来说：“你俩是老乡，找他谈谈，你能解决他的问题”。十分钟后，他俩一齐来了说：“班长和老同志对我这样好，我一定从今天起好好干”。
    “是在战时呀，在教练上我不能先讲理论和叫他们记些空名词，先学拆卸五大部，第一天看看，第二天学瞄准和排除故障，只五天就会了，最后两天演习了利用地形挖工事，敌火下运动的各种动作。我放心了，现在可以干一下。
    “战斗前一天，连里动员后回到班里组织互助组，选举了杜双建、赵清年当组长。第一组赵清年、白志学、杨学保和我，各人都定了作战计划。第二天清早进入战斗，这是新同志来后第一次任务。“全班挖工事，多流汗少流血，我们为了打死敌人，不是叫敌人打死我们。”这是我第一次向他们下命令，他们的动作很快，不过十分钟两个组都挖好了。
    “杜双建的歪把是掩护重机枪的，我的转盘作机动火力。“一班长！敌人从西南路过来，半个村子被包围了，你的机枪去配合二排！”连长向我下命令，“第一组跑步”！我第二次下命令。
    “发挥火力，杀伤敌人，自己选择阵地。”二排长给了任务。在一座院子里我们找好了阵地，四个人互助做了工事，杨学保在枪眼里监视敌人，白志学蹲在一颗大树下。敌人开始打炮了，飞机飞在头上，白志学、杨学保在院当中挖掩蔽工事，我这次是试试他俩的胆子，可是只五分钟就挖好了。
    “敌人开始冲锋了，一个炮弹落在阵地上。“快卧下！”一听炮弹出口，我就告诉他们怎样隐蔽，敌人更近了。“我的机枪一响，你们就到工事里去，敌人知道这里有机枪要打炮的。”我揣着机枪射去，赵清年卧在地下压子弹。“我也出来打一下吧！”白志学向我要求。“到右面去监视敌人”。“班长你放心。”他看我时常扭头望他。“敌人要冲了”！在左面监视敌人的杨学保，向大家报告。敌人冲到阵地前，互助组用手榴弹把他们打回去。我们又接受了命令去配合三排坚守街北的碉堡。杨学保平视东面枪眼，白志学监视西面枪眼，赵清年负责联络。我把枪对准着南头外面的敌人，打倒两个，别的敌人再也不敢露头。可是白志学报告，他听到街南房子里有敌人说话，赵清年去报告了三排的第三班。炸毁街南的屋墙，敌人被解决了。
    “太阳偏西，敌人的冲锋被打退了。可是炮打得更紧，全村只剩下我们东西两座房子，一颗炮弹把西屋也打塌了，一个老太太在屋里哭叫：“班长！我把老太太搞出来吧！”白志学把她拉出来，又给她拿出来了一缸面。
    “第二组坚持阵地保护了重机枪，在他们阵地周围落了二十多个炮弹，敌人几次冲到阵地，可是全被他们打退了。机枪是杜双建一个人打的，陶武英、卢守坤轮流监视敌人和负责联络。我们完成了任务，没有一个伤亡，白志学、杜双建当了战斗英雄，这是第一次。我代理排长，就是在这次战斗以后。”
