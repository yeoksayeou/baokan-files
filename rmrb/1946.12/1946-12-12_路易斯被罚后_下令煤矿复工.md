    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. After being fined, Lewis, the president of the United Mine Workers of America, ordered the coal mines to resume production on the 7th. He announced his willingness to negotiate a new contract with government agencies and private mine owners from now until March 1st of next year. According to Lewis's explanation, the resumption of work is to satisfy the American people's need for coal. The new contract negotiations originally began before the general strike on the 20th of last month. Because the old contract expired on November 1st, the miners' union demanded that the weekly working hours be reduced from 54 hours to 40 hours, with the weekly wage remaining at $75.25. However, this was rejected by the government and private mine owners, so the union had no choice but to declare a strike. The government, on the other hand, ordered the union to stop the strike through the court. The American Bar Association stated that the court's action exceeded its authority, and there was even less reason to try Lewis. The coal mine strike has received the support of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor. Subsequently, the court's fine on the miners' union and Lewis was also condemned by democratic public opinion from all sides, calling it an unprecedentedly huge fine in American legal history. The president of the Labor Federation, Green, condemned the government's means under the guise of the court as "despotic means."

    路易斯被罚后
    下令煤矿复工
    【新华社延安九日电】美国煤矿工人联合会主席路易斯，于七日下令煤矿复工，他宣布愿意从现在起至明年三月一日止，与政府机关及私人矿主谈判新合同。据路氏解释，复工是为了使美国人民对燃煤的需要得到满足。按新合同谈判原在上月二十日开始的大罢工前即已举行，因旧合同于十一月一日即告期满，谈判中矿工联合会要求每周工时从五十四小时减至四十小时，每周工资依旧为七十五元二角五分，但为政府及私人矿主拒绝，工会才不得已宣布罢工，而政府方面则通过法庭命令工会停止罢工。全美律师公会曾声明法庭此举越出其权限，而审判路易斯更无理由。煤矿罢工会获得产业工会联合会及美国劳工联合会之支持，其后法庭对矿工联合会及路氏之判处罚金亦为各方民主舆论所谴责，称之为美国法律史上空前巨大的罚金。劳工联合会主席格林斥责政府此种假乎法庭的手段为“专制手段”。
