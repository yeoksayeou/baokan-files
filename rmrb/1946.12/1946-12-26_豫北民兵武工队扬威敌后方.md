　　Yubei Militia Guerrilla Force Displays Might Behind Enemy Lines

　　[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The work teams and militia in various parts of Yubei are universally carrying out struggles against "retaliation," punishing traitors and bullies, and striking against the "Homecoming Corps," and have achieved many victories in the past month. In Tangyin, the "Homecoming Corps" engaged in "retaliation" everywhere. Tang Peijing, a farmer from Guxian Village, was brutally murdered. Han Chunfa, a farmer from Panhuang Village, had thirty *shi* of grain, a pig, and a bundle "retaliated" by traitors and bullies, leaving his family of seven without food or clothing. The broad masses all hated them to the bone. On the night of the 6th of this month, the local militia, in coordination with a unit of local armed forces, wiped out the entire "Homecoming Corps" entrenched in Shangzhuang in one fell swoop, killing and wounding six, capturing eleven, and seizing five rifles and fifteen hand grenades. The "Homecoming Corps" stationed in Hufeng rushed to reinforce, but was repelled by our militia. Our Jiaozuo Militia Guerrilla Force struck the "Homecoming Corps" three times in one week, attacking strongholds in Yanhe, Dongxi Jiaokou, Linghou, and Dazhangqi Qu, destroying a total of eight enemy blockhouses in the three battles, killing two members of the "Homecoming Corps," capturing twelve, and seizing three rifles and pistols, twenty hand grenades, and four *jin* of gunpowder, and distributed hundreds of leaflets. The Anyang militia continuously penetrated enemy-held villages and captured traitors and bullies. In the first ten days of the month alone, according to incomplete statistics, they captured nine members of the "Homecoming Corps," seized 124 bullets, nine indigenous rifles, two pistols, and eleven hand grenades. Under the cover of armed forces, a major political offensive was also launched. After listening to our propaganda, the wife of landlord Qin Wangxi from Gutuo Village said to the militia, "I don't want the things that were 'retaliated.' They (referring to the Jiang puppets) insisted on sending them to me, so I'm keeping them for now, to give to the masses in the future."

　　[This newspaper's Jiaozuo dispatch] Under our armed forces' initiative to attack and coordinate with political offensives, the Jiang puppets in Jiaozuo were terrified, and the retaliation teams have successively and voluntarily returned the "retaliated" grain and money. The special agent landlords in Xifengfeng and Tazhang villages were so frightened that they dared not stay at home at night, and rode donkeys to Wangfeng Village to "escape" as soon as it got dark, crowding the streets of Wangfeng Village. The pseudo-self-defense guards in Xifengfeng heard the people say, "The Eighth Route Army is coming to our village soon!" The son of "Regiment Commander" Liu Jiuzhen (Liu's bodyguard) trembled all over and handed his pistol to his father, saying, "I'm leaving, you can stay in the village if you're brave." Even the pseudo-Bo'ai County Magistrate, after hearing this news, anxiously said to his subordinates, "The old Eighth Route Army is to the south, and we can't go up the mountains to the north, there's nothing I can do." Xu Changji, the chief guarantor of Lifeng Village, a so-called "consolidated" stronghold, was even more terrified, afraid that the people would settle accounts with him when the Eighth Route Army arrived, and absconded with the money. Many traitorous elements, influenced by our lenient policy, began to prepare for a way out, waiting for an opportunity to return to the side of the people. For example, the 15,000 yuan "ammunition estimate fee" dispatched to Xifengfeng Village in November was not collected by the pseudo-guarantor. Liu Binghe, a stubborn landlord in the village, returned the 5,000 yuan in silver dollars "retaliated" from the masses in its entirety. The landlord of Laojunmiao Village also successively returned a "retaliated" donkey, three bolts of cloth, 10,000 yuan in silver dollars, and two *shi* of wheat. Many village "self-defense corps" dare not stand guard at night, fearing that they will be killed first if the guerrillas enter the village. Once, when the "self-defense corps" in Lifeng Village saw our armed political offensive team, they shouted, "The old Eighth Route Army is here, they all have Hanyang 88s!" and hid in the blockhouse in panic, not daring to fire a single shot.

　　豫北民兵武工队扬威敌后方
    【本报长治讯】豫北各地的工队、民兵、普遍进行反“倒算”惩奸霸打击“还乡团”的斗争，一月来已获不少胜利。汤阴“还乡团”到处“倒算”，固县村农民唐培景，竟遭残杀；潘荒村农民韩春发被奸霸“倒算”走谷子三十石、猪一口、包袱一个，全家七口衣食无着，广大群众，无不恨之入骨。本月六日夜，当地民兵配合地方武装一部，一举将盘据上庄之“还乡团”全部歼灭；毙伤六人，俘十一名，缴获长枪五支、手榴弹十五颗。驻胡峰“还乡团”赶来增援，又被我民兵击退。我焦作民兵武工队一周内曾三打“还乡团”。攻进阎河、东西交口、岭后、大掌其曲等据点，三次战斗共毁敌炮楼八座，毙“还乡团”二名，俘十二名，缴获长短枪三支，手榴弹二十个，火药四斤，并散发传单数百份。安阳民兵不断深入敌后村庄，活捉奸霸，仅上旬不完全统计，即捉“还乡团”九人，缴获子弹一百二十四发，土枪九支，手枪二支，手榴弹十一颗，在武装掩护下，政治攻势亦大开展。谷驼村地主秦王喜之女人听我宣传后，对民兵说：“俺不要‘倒算’的东西，他们（指蒋伪）硬给俺送来，俺还给保存着，等将来给群众哩”。
    【本报焦作讯】在我武装主动出击并配合政攻下，焦作蒋伪惊恐万状，倒算队纷纷自动退还“倒算”粮款。西冯封、塔掌两村特务地主们吓的晚上不敢在家住，天擦黑就赶上毛驴到王封村“逃难”，把王封村的街头挤满了。西冯封伪自卫围听老百姓说：“八路军快到本村了”，“团长”刘久贞的儿子（刘的护兵）浑身打颤，把手枪交给父亲，说：“我要走了，你胆大就住村里吧”。连伪博爱县长听到这消息后也焦急地对部下说：“往南是老八路，往北上不了山，我也没办法”。号称“巩固”据点李封村的总保长许长继更是胆战心惊，怕八路军一去，老百姓和他算总账，卷款潜逃了。不少奸伪分子，则在我宽大政策影响下，开始预备后路，待机仍然站到人民方面来。如西冯封村十一月派下的一万五千元“子弹预计费”，伪保长不敢收了。该村顽固地主刘炳和从群众那里“倒算”大洋五千元，仍原盘归还了群众。老君庙村地主亦相继退还“倒算”驴一头，布三匹，大洋一万元，两石麦子。许多村“自卫团”不敢在黑夜站岗，怕游击队进村先被打死。李封村的“自卫团”一次看见我武装政攻组去了，大嚷“老八路来了，都是三八式”！惊慌地躲进了炮楼，一枪也不敢放。（王汝珍）
