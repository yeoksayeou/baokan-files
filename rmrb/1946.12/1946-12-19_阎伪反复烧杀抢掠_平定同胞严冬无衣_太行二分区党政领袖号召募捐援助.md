　　【This newspaper, Changzhi, 16th Dispatch】 Fan Yusheng, Commissioner of the Taihang Second Administrative Office, and Comrade Yu Yichuan of the Prefectural Committee, recently sent a letter to the Taihang Xinhua Daily, calling on the six counties of Yuci, Wuxiang, Licheng, Lucheng, Changzhi, and the towns in the core areas, to launch a donation campaign of "one piece of clothing, one piece of cotton, one yuan," to support the farmers in the Pingding area in their struggle against Yan's puppet regime. The letter stated: "Since the autumn harvest, Yan's puppet troops in Pingding have launched repeated sweeping operations against our liberated area villages and towns. To date, almost every village in the county's nine districts has suffered from the devastation of Yan's stubborn troops' plunder, burning, and killing. Currently, more than 40,000 people have withdrawn from areas near enemy strongholds and along the Pingding-Jingxing Highway. While most of the masses managed to salvage some clothing, food, and grain, and the government has resettled them, organized self-rescue production, and persisted in guerrilla warfare, more than 5,000 people have not been able to bring out any food or clothing. In this harsh winter, these people cannot go out, cannot produce, and are suffering from hunger and cold. Many have fallen ill in the past month or so due to lack of clothing and food. Pingding suffered from enemy devastation during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, leaving most homes empty. Now, it has been hit by another major disaster from Yan's puppet regime. It will be difficult to sustain solely through self-rescue." Therefore, we specifically call on the above-mentioned public and private shops (excluding small private businesses), factories, institutions, and schools in Yuci, Wuxiang, and other counties, as well as villages and towns in the core areas, to "uphold the spirit that all farmers under heaven are one family, and launch a donation campaign of 'one piece of clothing, one piece of cotton, one yuan' to support the border area farmers in their struggle against Yan's puppet regime. The sooner the better, donate and send immediately (to the Second Administrative Office), with a deadline of one month. We should also widely publicize among the masses to enhance their will to fight against Yan's puppet regime and strive for victory in the self-defense war."
    Further dispatch: The Taihang Second Administrative Office, in order to provide relief to the Pingding refugees, has already allocated 3 million yuan in loans a month ago to resettle and organize refugee production. On the 3rd of this month, it allocated over a thousand jin of cotton wadding and a batch of clothing, and dispatched two comrades, including Li Wen, a staff member of the office, to specifically express condolences and organize resettlement. Our Pingding Democratic Government is actively organizing refugee production and has now restored seven coal kilns and six blacksmith furnaces, and organized transportation teams to carry out transportation and production between Yuanshi, Zanhuang, and Xiyang. Most of the women are participating in weaving in the newly inhabited villages.

　　阎伪反复烧杀抢掠  平定同胞严冬无衣
    太行二分区党政领袖号召募捐援助
    【本报长治十六日电】太行二专署专员樊雨生，地委于一川同志顷致函太行新华日报号召榆、武黎、潞、长等六县及腹心区市镇，发动一件衣，一块棉、一元钱的募捐运动，支援平定地区农民对阎伪斗争。该函内称：“平定阎伪自秋收以来，向我解放区村镇大举进行反复扫荡，迄今该县九个区几无一村未遭阎顽抢掠烧杀的摧残。目前仅敌据点附近及平（定）井（陉）公路两旁群众退出者已达四万余人，除大部群众经过抢收，运出一点衣物食粮，并经政府安置组织生产自救，坚持游击战争外，尚有五千多人粮食衣物均未带出。时值严冬，这些群众不能出门，不能生产，饥寒交迫，嗷嗷待哺。近月余来因无衣无食而致病者甚多。平定经八年抗战受敌蹂躏，十室九空，而今又遭阎伪巨灾，若单靠自救势难支持”。为此特号召上述榆、武等县公私商店（私营小商除外）、工厂、机关、学校，腹心区村、镇，“本天下农民是一家的精神，发动一件衣、一块棉、一元钱的募捐运动，支持边地农民对阎伪斗争，时间越快越好，随捐随送（交二专署），时间一个月。并在群众中广泛展开宣传，提高群众对阎伪斗争意志，争取自卫战争胜利”。
    又电：太行二专署为救济平定难胞，已于月前拨发三百万元贷款安置组织难民生产。本月三日又拨发棉絮千余斤，衣服一部，并派办公室科员李文等二同志前去专门慰问，组织安置。我平定民主政府正积极组织难民生产，现已恢复煤窑七座，打铁炉六座，并组织运输队往来于元（氏）赞（皇）昔（阳）等地之间进行运输生产。妇女大部参加新住村庄纺织。
