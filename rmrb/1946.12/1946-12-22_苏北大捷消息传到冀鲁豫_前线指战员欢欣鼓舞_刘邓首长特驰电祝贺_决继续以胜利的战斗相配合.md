In less than an hour, it spread by telephone to all the troops on the front lines. After the great victory in Hua County, the frontline commanders and soldiers were sharpening their swords and preparing to win even greater victories. They were even more elated when they heard this gratifying news and applauded in unison. Some comrades jumped up and applauded, and some comrades said, "Admire!" "A really beautiful fight!" "What's the point of Chiang Kai-shek's National Congress continuing?" More comrades said, "We must fight a few more big victories to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive even faster!"
