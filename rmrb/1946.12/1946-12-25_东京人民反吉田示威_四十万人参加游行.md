　　Tokyo People's Anti-Yoshida Demonstration
    400,000 People Participate in March
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 22nd: Tokyo dispatch: According to the latest statistics, the number of participants in the anti-Yoshida cabinet demonstration and march in Tokyo on the 17th was not the previously reported 100,000 plus. According to a reporter from the Baltimore Sun, the total number reached 400,000. Yoshida feigned illness and hid on this day. The motions proposed by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party to dissolve the current Diet and for the Yoshida cabinet to resign were rejected after five hours of heated debate due to the majority of reactionary party members. There were still 160 people in favor. Tokyo newspapers published a series of editorials on the 18th, discussing the Japanese people's lack of trust in the Yoshida cabinet. The Asahi Shimbun warned that unless the government is reorganized, reconstruction efforts will be fruitless. The newspaper also predicted that a democratic cabinet will be formed in the next election to be held early next year.

　　东京人民反吉田示威
    四十万人参加游行
    【新华社延安二十二日电】东京讯：据最后统计，十七日东京街头反吉田内阁示威大游行之参加人数非前所报告之十余万，据美国巴尔的摩太阳报记者称，总数达四十万人之谱。吉田在这天称病躲避，社会党与共产党所提要求解散本届议会及吉田内阁辞职之动议，于五小时激辩后，由于反动政党议员占多数而被否决，赞成者仍有一六○人。东京各报于十八日发表一连串社论，论述日人对吉田内阁缺乏信任。朝日新闻警告称：除非政府改组，复兴工作均将毫无成效。该报并预计明年初举行之下次选举将有一民主内阁。
