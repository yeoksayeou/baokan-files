　　Unified Leadership of Party, Government, Military, and People: Becoming the Backbone of Guerrilla Warfare Leadership

　　From September to November, the guerrilla war in Huixian County achieved brilliant results and created valuable experiences in three months, which deserves attention from all regions. A portion of it (militia operations) was published on December 14th. Now, its entire experience is described below for reference.

　　War gives our various tasks a total test. Our various tasks must be a hundred times stronger in the war, coordinate to resist, and defeat the enemy. This first requires the unparalleled strength of the Party's unified leadership. Huixian County has done a good job in this regard. This is not only reflected in the good coordination between the county and district backbone regiments and the militia self-defense forces in combat, but also in the fact that the targets to be attacked and how to attack them are uniformly decided by the county party committee, truly achieving dual roles and responsibilities. The county head (concurrently the regiment leader) not only leads troops to command operations, but also personally scouts enemy situations, mobilizes stretcher-bearers, and prepares food and water (as was the case in the attack on Zhaotun). The county party secretary often accompanies the army, grasps policies, and ensures the mobilization of manpower and supplies. The deputy political commissar of the regiment sometimes also checks or guides local work in the capacity of the county party committee. The district government and district cadre team operate together. The branch committee secretary often reads newspapers and gives speeches to the soldiers, and personally reviews or recruits party members among the soldiers. The Party, government, military, and people are closely united, like family members. The troops rely on the people, protect the people, and support the militia, truly becoming the backbone of guerrilla warfare. The militia and the masses love their own army, rely on their own army, advance together, retreat together, and coordinate like limbs, becoming an invincible collective in the war. This is the first point.

　　County and District Backbone Regiments: Frequent Mobile Attacks

　　County and district backbone regiments must be frequently placed in mobile positions, closely integrated with the interests of the masses, rely on the militia and masses to accurately grasp intelligence, seize opportunities, and constantly take the initiative to attack selected targets; this is not only easy to win and boost the morale of the military and civilians, but also most effective in eliminating small groups of plundering enemies. At the same time, the contradiction between the local desire for troops to be dispersed and the troops' tendency to concentrate can also be easily resolved. But first of all, it is necessary to clarify the operational policy of the local guerrilla forces, which is to accumulate small victories into large victories, and to avoid the mentality of "only eating big fish." It is important to know that being greedy and biting off more than one can chew is completely useless. The masses' perception is very realistic. For example, when the "Homecoming Corps" is rampaging and looting in the village, if our troops rush up and wipe out the enemy in one fell swoop, then the masses' understanding of our military strength and their inner joy in this situation will be much better than if we abandon the small and only attack an enemy that cannot be completely eliminated. This point was clearly demonstrated after the Huixian troops' surprise attack on Zhaotun and ambush at Liuhe, which annihilated the "Homecoming Corps" twice. At that time, the masses happily said: "This is better than defeating a regiment! It relieves us of so much pain!"

　　After selecting the target, it is necessary to mobilize the Party, government, military, and people together to ensure victory. At the same time, tactically, we must boldly penetrate deep into the enemy's rear. This is the second point.

　　Huixian County has even more unique creations in the militia's guerrilla activities, which are mainly based on the strengthened unified leadership of the Party, boldly correcting the practice of concentrating the militia and letting the cadres "do the work," and instead letting the masses fight on their own. They first made it clear to the militia ideologically that fighting is to protect their own emancipated interests, to protect everyone's good times, and the goal is for each village to fight against the local tyrants and "Homecoming Corps." They emphasized that we have many people, we are familiar with the situation, if there are few enemies we will fight them ourselves, and if there are many enemies, the troops will support us. This greatly boosted the morale of the militia. The militia was closely integrated with the masses in the war, strengthening the role of the village command, so that the masses truly achieved organized war preparedness, combat, production, transfer, and intelligence liaison. As a result, fighting broke out everywhere, the enemy panicked, the masses were excited, and the initiative and creativity were highly developed, achieving brilliant results and opening up the struggle. Here, it must be affirmed and clarified that letting the militia operate on their own must be coordinated with the activities of the backbone armed forces, otherwise they will be defeated one by one and suffer unnecessary losses. This is the third point.

　　The above three are inseparable in actual struggle. This is the valuable experience of the people of Huixian County fighting with Chiang Kai-shek's puppets for three months.

　　辉县游击战经验述评
    本报研究室
    党政军民一元化领导  成为游击战领导骨干
    从九月到十一月，三个月内，辉县游击战争取得了辉煌战绩，创造了宝贵经验，值得各地注意。其中一部（民兵作战）已于十二月十四日刊出，今将其全部经验分述于后，借供参考。
    战争给我们各种工作以总考验。我们的各种工作必须在战争中百倍顽强，协同抗击，战胜敌人。这首先要求党的一元化领导的无比坚强，在此点上，辉县作的很好。这不仅表现在作战中县区基干兵团和民兵自卫队配合的好，且在作战之前要打的对象和怎样打法，都由县委会统一决定，真正做到了兼职兼权。县长（兼团长）除常时带领部队指挥作战外，并能亲自侦察敌情，动员担架，准备水饭，（打赵屯即如此）县委书记经常随军，掌握政策，保证人力的动员和给养。团里副政委有时也同样以县委身份检查或指导地方工作。区政府和区干队一块活动，分委书记常给战士念报、讲话，亲自审查或发展战士党员，党政军民，亲密团结，犹如家人，部队依靠了人民，保卫了人民，扶植了民兵，真正成为游击战争中的骨干，民兵和群众拥爱自己的军队，仰仗自己的军队，一起前进，一起后退，配合如同手足，在战争中成为一个不可战胜的集体。此其一。
    县区基干兵团  经常机动出击
    县区基干兵团必须经常放在机动位置上，密切结合群众利益，依靠民兵群众确掌情报，抓紧时机，选好对象不断的主动出击；还不仅易于制胜，振奋军民斗志，且对于扑灭小股抢掠之敌最为有效，同时，地方上希望部队分散，而部队往往要集中的矛盾亦可迎刃而解。但首先要明确地方游击部队的作战方针，是集小胜为大胜，切忌“专吃大鱼”的思想，要知道贪多嚼不烂，是全然无益的。群众的观感非常现实，如当“还乡团”正在村中横行抢劫时，我们部队赶上去，一举歼灭敌人，那吗，群众在这种场合下，对于我军力量的认识以及内心的快慰，要比我们甩下小的不打，而专打一个不能全部消灭的敌人好的多。这一点，辉县部队在奇袭赵屯和伏击刘河，两次歼灭“还乡团”后，得到了明证，当时群众高兴的说：“这比打一个团还好哩！给咱们解除多少痛苦呀！”
    对象选好后，定要做到党政军民一齐动员起来，胜利才更有保证。同时，在战术上必须大胆的向敌后深入。此其二。
    在民兵的游击活动上，辉县更有其独特创造，这主要是基于强化了的党的一元化领导，大胆的纠正了集中民兵由干部“把活干”的做法，而放手让群众自己去打。他们首先让民兵从思想上明确起来，打仗是为了保卫自己的翻身利益、保卫大家的好时光，目标是各村打各村的奸霸“还乡团”，强调我们人手多，情况熟，敌人少了自己打，敌人多了，有部队替咱撑腰。这样大大提高了民兵的斗志，民兵在战争中和群众紧紧结合在一起，加强了村指挥部的作用，使群众切实做到了有组织的备战、作战，以及生产、转移和情报联络等。于是到处打响了，敌人恐慌了，群众兴奋了，高度发挥了积极性和创造性，获得了光辉的战绩，打开了斗争局面，这里必须肯定明确起来的是放手让民兵自己活动，必须有基干武装的活动配合，否则就会被各个击破，遭受不应有的损失。此其三。
    以上三者在实际斗争中是不可分的，这是辉县人民和蒋伪搏斗三月的宝贵经验。
