　　Taiyue Circles Hold Forum on State Affairs
　　Telegraph Opposes Chiang's "National Assembly"
　　[This newspaper Taiyue, November 25th dispatch] (Delayed) Chiang Kai-shek's convening of a one-party-controlled "National Assembly" and attacking Yan'an has aroused fierce opposition from people from all walks of life in this region. At 4 p.m. on the 20th, representatives from all walks of life held a forum. At the meeting, Mr. Gao Yanliu, an old gentleman from the Henan Democratic National Construction Association, said: "Chiang Kai-shek is convening a pseudo-National Assembly and is determined to draft a private constitution so that he can sell out the country himself. Therefore, the people must rise up to oppose it." Li Henian, a model military family member, said: "China belongs to the common people, and everyone has a share. We do not recognize his betrayal of the country. If he wants to attack Yan'an, we will defend it." Comrade Li Zheren pointed out, "Chiang Kai-shek's sinister intentions are bound to fail. His subordinates are corrupt and soldiers are weary of war. Although he has American military aid, he has lost popular support and is bound to follow in Yuan Shikai's footsteps of dreaming of becoming emperor and failing. We must oppose the "National Assembly," oppose the attack on Yan'an, defend Chairman Mao, and defend the thorough emancipation of the common people." All representatives unanimously resolved to send a telegram to representatives across the country and three million people in the entire region to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's "National Assembly" and defend Yan'an, and called on compatriots across the country to rise up and fight for genuine peace and democracy.

　　太岳各界座谈国事
  　通电反对蒋记“国大”
    【本报太岳十一月二十五日电】（迟到）蒋介石召开一党包办的“国大”与进攻延安，已引起本区各界人士的激烈反对。二十日下午四时，各界代表举行座谈。会上河南民主建国协会高延柳老先生说：“蒋介石召开伪国大，决计裂定私人宪法，以便自己卖国，因此人民就得自己起来反对。模范军属李鹤年说：“中国是老百姓的，人人有份，他卖国我们不承认，他要进攻延安我们要保卫。李哲人同志指出，“蒋介石的祸心必然失败，手下人贪污腐化，兵心厌战，虽有美国军火援助，却失去民心，必然走向袁世凯梦想皇帝失败的覆辙。我们要反对“国大”反对进攻延安，保卫毛主席，保卫老百姓的彻底翻身。各代表一致决议通电全国代表全区三百万人民反对蒋介石的“国大”和保卫延安，并呼吁全国同胞一致奋起为真正的和平民主而战。
