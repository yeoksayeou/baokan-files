　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] On November 9th, a certain company in "He Xian" on the Jilu豫 Front convened a meeting of activists at its station. Deputy Political Commissar Gao reported on the current situation and tasks, conveyed the seven major proposals and seven oppositions put forward by leaders Liu and Deng, and called on everyone to unite in thought and action, adhere to the struggle, until victory. He also praised Comrade Li Liansheng, the model health chief of the Second Battalion, and called on everyone to learn from Comrade Li Liansheng's spirit of stepping forward to command the troops in critical situations. Although his left eye was blinded, he returned to the army to work actively and resolutely struggle after recovering from his injuries. Company Commander Zheng then spoke, urging everyone to correctly recognize the situation, understand our strength, and resolutely oppose the right-leaning thoughts of peace, enjoyment, and evasion of war among individual personnel. He cited practical combat experience to explain Chairman Mao's tactics in detail. He said: "Whoever fights according to Chairman Mao's tactics will surely win the battle." Finally, he called on everyone to intensify their studies and be prepared to win battles at any time.
