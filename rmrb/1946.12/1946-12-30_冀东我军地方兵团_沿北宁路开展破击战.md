The Jidong Eighth Route Army Local Corps has launched a widespread sabotage war along both sides of the Beining Railway to cooperate with the crushing of Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against the Tianjin-Beijing-Baoding triangle area. From the 9th to the 17th of this month, within a week, more than 250 Chiang's soldiers were wiped out and more than ten strongholds were captured.
