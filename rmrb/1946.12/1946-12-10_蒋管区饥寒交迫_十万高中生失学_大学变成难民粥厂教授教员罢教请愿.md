　　Chiang-Controlled Areas Plagued by Hunger and Cold
　　100,000 High School Students Out of School
　　Universities Become Soup Kitchens for Refugees; Professors and Teachers Strike and Petition
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 7th: According to estimates by the *Yanjing News*, at least 100,000 high school graduates in the "Chiang-controlled areas" across the country will be unable to continue their education this year due to difficult living conditions and the impact of the civil war. According to news from various newspapers, the lives of students currently in school are also extremely difficult, and even universities have become "soup kitchens" for refugees (according to Nankai University Secretary-General Huang Zijian). In North China, the subsidies that Peking University students used to rely on and the relief grain for Tsinghua University have been stopped. The relief grain for Yenching University and Fu Jen Catholic University has been exhausted. Many students are facing the risk of dropping out of school due to lack of funds for meals. With winter approaching, Nankai University and the Peiping Student Relief Association plan to lend more than 300 winter coats, but more than 1,800 people have applied to borrow them. "Peking University," which had previously received enemy and puppet property, is still in dire straits because the Ministry of Education only allocated 1 billion out of the 6 billion yuan needed for rehabilitation. The National Art College has been re-established for half a year, but the branch has not issued a penny. Some faculty and staff members have not received their salaries for four months. As a result, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University, and Tianjin Normal College have not been able to formally start classes. Teachers and staff in various places have launched protests due to economic difficulties. Faculty and staff at Tangshan Institute of Technology went on strike on November 11th, and workers at the Institute of Technology also went on strike in response due to low wages. National colleges and universities in Peiping and Tianjin, including Peking University and Normal College, have decided to jointly petition the branch for adjustments in treatment. Provincial colleges and universities in Hebei Province have also decided that "if the Chiang government fails to provide the necessary funding, they will go on strike this month." Teachers and staff in Shenyang middle schools, national and provincial schools in Xuzhou, and teachers and staff in counties such as Ya'an and Leshan in Sichuan have all petitioned the government due to their inability to make a living.

  　蒋管区饥寒交迫
　　十万高中生失学
  　大学变成难民粥厂教授教员罢教请愿
    【新华社延安七日电】据《燕京新闻》估计：今年全国“蒋管区”至少有十万以上高中毕业生因生活困难及内战影响，无法升学。又据各地报纸消息：在校学生之生活亦极痛苦，甚至大学也已变成收容难民的“粥厂”（南开大学秘书长黄子坚语）。在华北，北平北大学生过去所依靠的维持费，清华的赈给粮，均已停止，燕大及辅仁的救济粮，已用尽。很多学生因膳费无着，而有失学之虞。今年冬已届，南开大学：北平学生救济会拟出借冬衣三百余件，但请借者却达一千八百余名，曾发接收敌伪财的“北大”，也因该校所需复员费六十亿，教部只发十亿，依然窘迫万状。国立艺专复校将半年，支部未发分文，教职员有四个月未领薪金者。因而北大清华南开及天津师院等校实际皆未能正式上课，各地教职员因经济困难，纷起抗争。唐山工学院教职员已于十一月十一日起，一致罢教，工院工友亦因工资过低罢工响应。平津国立各院校包括北大、师院等，决定联名电请支部调整待遇，河北省立各院学亦曾决定：“如蒋政府再不发给应有经费，将予本月内一致罢教”。沈阳各中学，徐州国立与省立各校、四川、雅安、乐山等县教职员，均因无法生活，向政府请愿。
