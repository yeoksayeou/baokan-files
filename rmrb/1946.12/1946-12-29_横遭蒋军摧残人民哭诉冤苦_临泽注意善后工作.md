　　People Cry Out in Anguish from the Brutality of Chiang Kai-shek's Troops
    Linze Pays Attention to Aftermath Work
    I. Relief and Compensation for People in Distress
    II. Hold Memorial Services for the Deceased
    III. Conduct Current Situation Education
    IV. Be Vigilant Against Suppression of Armed Secret Agents
    [Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu News] On November 22nd, after our army won a great victory in Hua County on the western front, the enemy in Juancheng panicked and fled south. As a result, the people of Linze, who had suffered under Chiang Kai-shek's troops for eighteen days, were liberated again. The people of Linze, after regaining their liberation, began to show the following conditions: First, the masses were particularly affectionate when they saw their own troops, party, government, army and civilian cadres. Second, they universally complained to their own army and cadres about the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Without any formal meetings or gatherings, they would meet in twos and threes, or fives and sevens, and start by complaining. The hatred, mixed with scolding and crying, was visible everywhere. Third, due to the inhuman atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the masses faced difficulties - in terms of manpower, some young and middle-aged people were captured or killed, resulting in a lack of labor. Grain, materials, and resources were destroyed, looted, and wasted, resulting in a lack of food and clothing.
    Based on the above situation, the leadership put forward the following work, with the overall aim of: helping the masses solve difficulties, carrying out the aftermath work after the enemy left, and seizing the opportunity to mobilize the masses. The specific aspects are: (1) Conducting condolences, compensation, and memorial services. (2) Conducting widespread education on the current situation and political education. (3) Reorganizing village organizations and reforming leadership composition. (4) The industrial and commercial departments are reorganizing the market, and setting a deadline for enemy goods and legal currency to leave the country. (5) Concentrating district and team militia to deal with bad elements and armed secret agents who disturb the people. The above work has already begun in a vigorous manner, and the masses have responded: "Ah! Our democratic government is still good!"
