[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] "Resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's sinister plot; the confluence and water release must be postponed until next summer." Director Wang Zhenhua of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Relief Association put forward this solemn demand on the 25th. He said: Currently, the weather is severely cold, and water turns to ice instantly. Digging soil is difficult, and building stone dams is even more impossible. If it is forced, the dikes will collapse and the dams will fall in the spring thaw, and the Yellow River disaster will be unimaginable. Therefore, the dangerous sections downstream cannot be repaired at present. Moreover, due to the continuous attacks and destruction by Chiang's troops, many dangerous sections have not been repaired yet. In the 22 dams from Liuzhuang in Nanhua (newly designated county) to Jiangsu Dam alone, 10 have been completely destroyed. The original dams were made of inner brick and outer stone, and after several emergency repairs, they could not be completed due to Chiang's troops' attacks. Under such circumstances, once the Yellow River water flows north, a huge disaster will inevitably follow. Secondly, the relocation funds for the residents along the river have not been allocated by Chiang's side to this day, and the residents cannot relocate. According to the old course, a total of more than 200,000 residents should be subsidized for relocation, requiring 2,050,000,000 yuan. Although the Executive Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (行总) recently agreed to allocate 1,500,000,000 yuan, this small amount is far from enough, and not a single penny has been paid to this day. It is said that this fund needs to be allocated in three batches, which will take at least three months. However, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is eagerly merging and releasing water around the New Year, which is obviously intended to put hundreds of thousands of people to death. At present, the relocation of residents has been suspended due to Chiang's side's failure to allocate relocation funds. We demand that the 1,500,000,000 yuan relief fund be allocated in full at once, so as to rush the relocation of residents. Furthermore, in terms of time, the urgency is also very obvious. According to the engineering statistics of Shou Zhang County alone, a total of 2,882,000 man-days are required for dike construction, dam construction, river excavation, and straightening of bends on the north and south banks. The county has a population of 230,000. Due to the losses of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, there are a total of 29,000 men aged 17 to 50 who can work. If the maximum amount of labor is calculated as one-third, with 10,000 people working every day, it will take 10 months to complete the work. This summer, the county tried its best to rush the river works, but the progress was quite slow due to Chiang's troops' attacks, and very few were completed. If the water is released now, even if emergency repairs are carried out, it is impossible, and all 230,000 people in the county will inevitably suffer a great disaster. Moreover, the time required for transportation and resettlement of river residents during relocation cannot be completed in one or two months. Based on the above situation, we vow to oppose the immediate confluence and water release and firmly advocate postponing it until next summer. We declare that in order to take the overall situation into consideration, what we oppose is not the Yellow River returning to its old course. As a commoner said in a petition, what we oppose is "moving the river to move the harm." Therefore, before the downstream dike restoration and risk repair and the relocation of river residents are completed, if the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique disregards the lives of the people and dares to release water privately, the seven million residents along the river and the thirty million people in the entire border region will surely rise up to armed self-rescue, and all consequences will be borne entirely by Chiang Kai-shek, who deliberately harmed the people.

　　天寒地冻时间紧迫下游险工无法整修
    蒋方不发迁移费使河道居民无法迁移
    合龙放水必须延至明夏
    边区救济分会王主任谈黄河问题
    【本报特讯】“坚决反对蒋介石的毒谋，合龙放水必须延至明年夏季。”晋冀鲁豫边区救济分会王振华主任于二十五日提出此严正主张。他说：目前天寒地冻，滴水成冰，掘土既难，修筑石坝更属不可能之事；如勉强为之，则明春解冻时必致堤塌坝倒，洪水泛滥，黄灾大祸实难想像，故下游险工目前实无法整修。且由于蒋军不断进攻破坏，险工至今仍有许多未及修补，仅南华（新划县）刘庄至江苏坝一段之廿二道坝中，即有十道全毁，原坝为内砖外石，几经抢修，皆因蒋军进攻未能完工。似此情况，一旦黄水北来，巨灾必相随而至。次为河道居民迁移费，蒋方至今未拨，居民无法迁移。按旧道应补助迁移费之居民共廿余万人，需款二百零五万万元，行总近虽允拨一百五十万万，但此微小数字，绝不足用，且至今亦未拨付分文；据谓此款需分三批拨付，至少要拖三个月；而蒋介石反动集团却急急于新年前后合龙放水，显系有意置此数十万人民于死地。目前居民迁移已因蒋方未拨迁移费而停顿，我们要求迅将一百五十万万救济费一次全部拨付，以便赶办居民迁移。再就时间而言，其紧迫程度亦很显然。仅据寿张县工程统计，南北两岸修堤、筑坝、挖河、裁弯取直等共需二百八十八万二千余工，全县人口二十三万，因八年抗日战争损失，其中十七岁至五十岁能出工之男子共二万九千人，出工最高量以三分之一计，每日出一万人，需时十个月始能完工。今夏该县曾尽力之所能赶修河工，终因蒋军之进攻而进度颇迟，完成者甚少，如目前即行放水，纵使抢修，亦不可能，全县二十三万人民将必罹大难。而河道居民迁移时所需运输安插之时间，亦非一月二日所能完成。根据上述情况，我们誓死反对目前即行合龙放水，坚决主张延至明夏。我们声明：为了顾全大局，我们所反对者并非黄河归故，正如一位老百姓的呈文上所说，我们反对的是“移河移害”。因此在下游复堤修险及河道居民迁移未完竣前，蒋介石反动集团如不顾民命，胆敢私自放水，则沿河七百万居民及全边区三千万人民必奋起武装自救，一切后果，当由蓄意残民肆虐之蒋介石负完全责任。
