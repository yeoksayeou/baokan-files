　　Starting with Checking the Backward
    In the Old District of Mazhuang, Twenty-Seven Households of Farmers Were Found Not to Have Turned Over
    [This newspaper Changzhi News] In Macun, an old district of Wu'an, it was discovered in this rent reduction that twenty-seven backward farmer households have not yet turned over. The reasons are: two households were mobilized by village cadres in past movements, but they were ideologically unawakened and did not participate in the struggle. Later, seeing that others had turned over, they only regretted it and did not seek to solve the problem with the cadres. There are seven old hired laborers, without an acre of land or a room. In the past, they only did odd jobs for others. During the past movements, they said, "We have no problems with pawns, tenant farming, or debts. We were paid for the odd jobs at the time. Being poor is just being poor!" Three households were impoverished by creditors' exploitation after their fathers died, but they couldn't remember clearly. They raised the issue in past struggles, but the creditors said, "It's not true." So they didn't dare to reason with the creditors and quietly let it go. Two households were away during past movements, and they didn't dare to mention it after returning, so they haven't turned over to this day. Two households raised issues that existed before the family was divided. After the problems were solved, the family members completely took away the things, and they remained poor. One household was deceived by the landlord. The landlord said, "It's enough to have rented land to farm. If you have too much land, you won't be able to farm it yourself and will suffer for nothing." He also gave them thirty catties of grain, so they still don't have self-cultivated land and rely entirely on farming rented land for a living. Another household was only given three mu of land during the past struggle. The cadres said it was not little. To this day, they still have no house to live in, and the land is not enough to farm. In addition, there are several so-called "no problem" poor people, one of whom even begs for food sometimes. After discovering these problems, the village cadres all said: We must check carefully and help the honest farmers more. The village is now brewing a thorough liquidation of the local despots and landlords. Everyone said, "We must first fill these people's pits, and turn over together!"

　　从检查落后入手
    老区马庄发现廿七户未翻身农民
    【本报长治讯】武安老区马村，这次查减中发现二十七户落后农民至今仍未翻身，原因是：有两户是过去运动时，村干部去动员过，他们思想不觉悟、不参加斗争，后来看见别人翻身啦，只是后悔，也未去找干部解决问题。有七户老雇工，地没一亩，房没一间，过去光给别人打短工，在过去运动时他们说：“咱典当、租佃、债务，啥问题都没有，打短工当时人家也给了钱，穷就穷吧！”有三户因父亲死了，都是债主剥削穷的，但自己记不清了，过去斗争提出过，债主说：“不切实。”就没敢与债主说理，悄悄完事了。有两户过去运动时在外，回来后也没有敢提，所以至今还未翻身。有两户提出问题是过去在未分家前的，问题解决后，本家们完全得走了东西，自己仍是穷光蛋。还有一户是受了地主骗，地主说：“有租地够种就算，地多了，自己也种不了，白受罪。”同时还给了三十斤粮食，所以现在还是没有自耕地，尽靠种租地生活。另一户是过去斗争中只给分了三亩地，干部说不少了，到现在仍没房子住，地也不够种，此外，还有几个都是所谓“没问题”的穷光蛋，其中有一户还有时讨饭吃。发现这些问题后，村干部都说：可得好好检查，老实农民还得多多帮助。现在村里正酝酿对恶霸地主的彻底清算，大家都说：“要先填这些人的坑，翻身一起翻！”
