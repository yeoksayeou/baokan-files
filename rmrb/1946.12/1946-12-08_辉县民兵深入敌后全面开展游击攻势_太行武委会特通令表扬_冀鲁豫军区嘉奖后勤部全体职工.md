Hui County Militia Penetrates Deep Behind Enemy Lines to Fully Launch Guerrilla Offensives
    Taihang Military Commission Issues Special Commendation
    Jilu Yu Military Region Commends All Logistics Department Staff
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the enemy and puppet forces' offensive, the Hui County militia, in coordination with the troops, has launched a comprehensive guerrilla offensive against the enemy and puppet forces, appearing frequently near the enemy and puppet forces, causing the enemy to panic and be beaten everywhere, dragging down the rear legs of the frontal enemy and puppet offensive, and effectively cooperating with our frontal military and civilians in combat.
    The Taihang Military Commission has issued a special commendation and introduced several recent combat activities: (1) On October 21, the joint defense militia of the Fifth District of Hui County extended into Wangcunpu and burned three enemy blockhouses. The joint defense militia of the Sixth District advanced to Da and Xiao Gongzhuang, five miles away from Hui County, and burned four enemy blockhouses. (2) On October 18, 19, and 20, in three days, our militia in the Yuhe and Mazhuang areas took the initiative to attack the enemy, killing and wounding 16 enemy soldiers who had occupied our Yuhe and Mazhuang areas. (3) On October 22, our Panshang militia, in coordination with the main force, repelled the pseudo Li Ying troops who had invaded our Panshang area and pressed the enemy all the way to Gaozhuang Town. That night, our militia and troops organized three night attacks on Gaozhuang, making the enemy uneasy all night. In total, the Hui County militia has killed 30 enemies, wounded 17, captured 2, and captured 1 "Homecoming Corps" member in half a month, and destroyed 10 blockhouses.

  　[Special Dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front of this Newspaper] The staff and workers of the Logistics Department of the Jilu Yu Military Region have achieved great results in production. They have universally launched competitions in the Patriotic Self-Defense War. In the past two months, they have produced a large number of bombs and military uniforms, ensuring the supply to the front line. The leaders of the military region specially awarded 60,000 ocean dollars and sent a letter of commendation, which said: "You have worked tirelessly and vigorously produced, so that every commander and fighter on the front line is relieved of the concern of not having bombs, and can concentrate on defeating the enemy... It is hoped that this spirit of hard work and serving the people will be maintained until the victory of the Patriotic Self-Defense War." After receiving the award, the staff and workers responded to the leaders of the military region with practical actions, and production became more active.
