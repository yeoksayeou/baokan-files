[This paper, Taiyue, 9th] This autumn, the crops in five administrative villages including Fushan Fancun, Tuling, Chuankou, Guanyinmiao, and Yuantou suffered from hailstorms, and the lives of the masses were very difficult. Old hero Shi Zhenming and women's hero Zhao Meiying personally organized and led women in textile work, calling on women to overcome the disaster from the tip of the spindle and the weaving shuttle. After the hailstorm hit the crops in August, many people wept bitterly, and people from Henan wanted to return to Henan. At that time, Zhao Meiying was anxious, and she and the old hero Shi Zhenming went along the hailstorm-stricken households to express their condolences and organize everyone to spin and weave, calling on them to use textile profits to supplement the shortage of grain. Zhao Meiying is a textile expert, and everyone believes in her. As a result, women from five villages organized a textile brigade of 431 people. At that time, some backward old women were not used to young women laughing and joking together, and did not want their women to go out, and said some sarcastic remarks; but Zhao Meiying turned a deaf ear and first organized everyone, and then solved individual problems. Finally, after persuasion and mobilization, elderly women were also organized into textile groups, and work points were allocated according to the amount of labor, expanding the textile lineup. Zhao Meiying not only has organizational skills, but also is good at cultivating cadres. She encouraged Li Xiuying to lead the groups in Fancun, taking care of the overall situation and traveling back and forth between the textile brigades in the five administrative villages. Currently, the entire brigade has 136 flat looms, 86 small looms, one shuttle-pulling loom, and 209 spinning wheels. It is planned that from the fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month of this year to the eighth day of the second lunar month of next year, the entire brigade will earn 6,607 shi and 2 dou and 7 sheng of corn through textile work, an average of 15 shi, 3 dou and 3 sheng per person, which can make up for all the grain lost in the hailstorm. In order to improve the textile technology of the entire brigade, they bought a shuttle-pulling loom from the Fushan Limin Factory, learned it themselves, and then taught the group members in each village, and borrowed money from the village cooperative to buy a shuttle-pulling loom, and opened a small training class to absorb textile activists from various villages to come and learn. After learning, they took the machine back to spread the knowledge.

    计划今冬明春赚粮六千六百石
    【本报太岳九日电】浮山范村、土岭、川口、观音庙、垣头等五个行政村，今秋庄稼遭雹灾，群众生活很苦。老英雄石振明与妇女英雄赵美英亲自组织领导妇女纺织，号召妇女从锭子尖上、织布梭里战胜灾荒。八月里冰雹打了庄稼后，许多人痛哭流涕，河南籍的人要回河南去。当时赵美英着了急，与老英雄石振明沿着雹灾户慰问与组织大家纺织，号召以纺织盈利来添补粮食的不足。赵美英是纺织能手，大家相信她。于是五个村的妇女组织了四百三十一人的纺织大队。当时也有些落后老婆，看不惯年青妇女在一块嘻嘻哈哈，不愿让自己的妇女出去，并说些风凉话；但赵美英硬着耳朵不听，先将大家组织起来，然后解决个别问题。最后经过说服动员，将老年妇女亦组织到纺织组内，以劳力大小变工分利，扩大了纺织阵容。赵美英不仅有组织能力，而且善于培养干部，她鼓励李秀英领导范村各组，自己照顾全面，往返于五个行政村的纺织大队。现全大队有平机一百三十六架，小机八十六架，拉梭机一架，纺车二百零九架。计划从今年阴历十月十五日起至明年二月八日，全大队纺织赚玉茭六千六百零七石二斗七升，每人平均十五石三斗三升，即可补足冰雹损失的全部粮食。为改进全大队的纺织技术，她们向浮山利民工厂买回拉梭机一部，自己学会，然后再到各村教会组员，并从村合作社贷款买拉梭机，开一小型训练班，吸收各村纺织积极分子前来学习，学会后带上机子回去传播。
