Anglo-American Rivalry in Palestine
    This Newspaper's Research Department

    According to a report from Angola at the end of last month, the Saudi Arabian army, equipped with American weapons, launched an offensive against Transjordan. They announced the reason for their advance was to oppose the newly crowned King of Transjordan's ambition to unite Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and other countries to establish a "Greater Syria Empire."
    With British support, the puppet King of Transjordan may indeed have such an "ambition." However, this event also more clearly exposes a part of the U.S. imperialist's great ambition to establish world hegemony. The United States claims that it has become a Mediterranean country and wants to plant a foot in the Middle East and Near East. To secure this foothold, it has set its sights on Palestine on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean.
    Palestine itself has no economic value. Its area is 26,000 square kilometers, only as large as a few counties in China. It is entirely desert land, with only some mineral deposits near the Dead Sea. However, from a military-strategic point of view, its importance is evident: it is close to the Suez Canal, which cuts off Asia and Africa and connects the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and, along with Egypt, it guards this canal; it has natural good harbors where ships from Europe to East Asia can dock. Pipelines from the large oil fields on the Mesopotamian (Iraqi) plateau run to the port of Haifa in Palestine. The United States also plans to build a pipeline from Saudi Arabia through Transjordan to Haifa. The air bases built here can control a large area spanning Europe, Asia, and Africa. ... Whoever occupies it can hold the Middle East and Near East under their arm.
    Britain has long coveted this place. After the First World War, it obtained the mandate for Palestine and Transjordan. During the Second World War, it occupied Iraq from here in May 1941. In July, it also stationed troops in Syria, which was originally under French mandate. The United States controlled Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and other places. After the war, the national movements in Arab countries (Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, etc.) rose, (Egypt demanded the withdrawal of British troops, Iraq demanded the revision of the unequal Anglo-Iraqi treaty...) To maintain its hegemony in the Middle East, Britain clung even more tightly to Palestine and refused to let go.
    When the League of Nations entrusted the rule of Palestine to Britain after the First World War, there were 75,000 Jews and 500,000 Arabs in the area. Now, there are 550,000 Jews and 1.11 million Arabs. Jews always want to return to this holy land to rebuild their homeland, while the Arabs of Palestine fear that if there are too many Jews, they will become a minority. Britain used this contradiction, just like the usual trick it used to rule India, to do its best to provoke animosity between the two local ethnic groups. Sometimes it helps the Jews, sometimes it gives the Arabs a boost. Back and forth, its sole purpose is to create opposition between them, weaken their strength, and thus facilitate its own rule.
    After the United States inserted a foot, the disputes in Palestine became more complex, and the situation became more serious. - Truman seized the Jews as a tool to do this. Under the pretext of solving the European Jewish refugee problem, he initiated the organization of a so-called "Anglo-American Palestine Investigation Committee," which, after investigation, issued a "report" "recommending" that 100,000 Jewish refugees be allowed to immigrate to Palestine each year. This was clearly masterminded by the U.S. side, which wanted to use this to enhance the position of Jews in Palestine and then seize control of Palestine from the Jews. After this suggestion was published, Arab countries strongly opposed it; the British government needed to seize the Arabs to consolidate its hegemony in the Middle East, unwilling to anger the Arabs, and even less willing to hand over the actual control of Palestine, so it did not adopt this suggestion. This caused fierce debates and even mutual scolding between the two countries. At this time, the Jews in Palestine were greatly dissatisfied, and secret armed groups actively engaged in activities, even blowing up the British military headquarters. The British authorities imposed martial law and forcibly suppressed them. At the same time, with the help of the United States, ships loaded with Jews secretly crossed the Mediterranean to enter Palestine. The spring in Washington's gun chamber, using Jews as bullets, shot vigorously towards the eastern shore of the Mediterranean. And London's pressure continued to be more violent on the Jews in Palestine, and ordered strict suppression of illegal immigrants; on August 7, it sent a note to the United States, saying that all illegal immigrants would be sent to concentration camps on the island of Cyprus. Airplanes scouted over the Adriatic coast, and destroyers patrolled the Palestinian coast, capturing thousands upon thousands of Jewish refugees who wanted to go to Palestine.
    Simultaneous with violent pressure, diplomatic activities were also carried out. This time, under the instigation of Britain, an "Anglo-American Cabinet Committee" was formed, and the result of the discussion was the proposal of the "Palestine Federal Plan," which is the plan to divide Palestine: into two states, each with two provinces, and both states would "autonomize" under British jurisdiction. Among them, the Arab autonomous state occupies a larger area, and the Jewish autonomous state occupies a smaller area. A condition was also attached: the United States needs to lend 250 million U.S. dollars to Arab countries to raise their living standards to be equal to those of the Jews. After this plan was published, both Arabs and Jews expressed dissatisfaction, and American financial capitalists also objected. As a result, the White House was silent; after a long time, a reply was sent to London, neither accepting nor directly rejecting the "Palestine Federation" plan, taking a non-cooperative attitude. Britain said it would never give up its mandate and would implement the federal plan alone; on September 10, it unilaterally convened a Palestine conference, but it did not yield any results. The real attitude of the United States is to force Britain to abandon its mandate through non-cooperation and let the United States control everything.
    On October 3, Truman issued another statement, still demanding immediate immigration, without waiting for the resolution of the entire Palestine issue. That night, the British Foreign Office expressed "regret" over Truman's statement, saying that it "may damage the delicate negotiations in progress." In mid-October, Britain again conducted temporary negotiations with the Jews, the Jewish Agency supported by the United States took a very tough stance, while Britain still did not show any concessions. On the surface, it fell into a stalemate, but in reality, the waves were still undulating, and bombs continued to explode in Palestine from time to time; the Jews desperately opposed British oppression, and British troops were often bombed. The Arabs also fiercely opposed American intervention, throwing bombs at the American embassy in Beirut. ... As a result, searches, arrests, conflicts, terror, martial law ... the eastern shore of the Mediterranean entered a quasi-war state.
    As the editorial of the Egyptian Cairo magazine *Middle East Public Opinion* said in early October: "What guides the United States' Near East policy is not the intention to improve the lives of the people of those countries, but the continuing greed of American capitalists." The United States does not particularly favor the Jews; they do whatever is beneficial to the greedy monopoly capitalists. That's how the Saudi Arabian army, with American weapons, entered the border of Transjordan. The eastern shore of the Mediterranean has entered a state of war from a quasi-war state. The Anglo-American rivalry in Palestine is not only threatening peace in the Near East, but has already begun to undermine peace.
    Arabs and Jews have no feud; for hundreds of years before the First World War, they lived in harmony. In recent years, class friendship has filled the gap between ethnic groups, and the solidarity of workers and progressives is becoming closer day by day. Without Britain creating friction and the United States stirring up trouble, this place should be calm. But now, the local people have become victims of the imperialists' ambitions. Eight Arab countries, including Egypt, have jointly requested the United Nations to discuss the Palestine issue. According to the United Nations Charter, the fate of the mandated territories of the old League of Nations should be jointly decided by the United Nations and the local people.

　　英美在巴勒斯坦的角逐
    本报资料室
    据上月末安哥拉发出的消息，美式装备的沙特阿拉伯大军，向外约但开始进攻。他们宣布进军的理由是反对外约但新近登极的国王联合巴勒斯坦、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、伊拉克等建立“大叙利亚帝国”的野心。
    在英国支持下，外约但傀儡国王也许会有这样的“野心”的。不过，在这事件上，也更显明的暴露出了美帝国主义树立世界霸权的大野心的一部分。美国扬言它自己已成为地中海的国家，它要在中东近东一带插进一只脚。为了把这只脚踏稳，它看中了地中海东岸的巴勒斯坦。
    巴勒斯坦本身，在经济上是毫无可取的。面积二万六千方公里，不过有中国的几个县那么大。全是沙漠地，只死海附近有些矿藏。不过，从军略地理的观点上看，它的重要性就很显然了：它靠近截断亚洲和菲洲沟通大西洋和印度洋的苏伊士运河，和埃及同为这条运河的守卫者；它有天然的好港湾，从欧洲到东亚各地的船只要在这里停泊。美索不达米亚（伊拉克）高原上大煤油田的油管，通到巴勒斯坦的海法港口。美国也计划从沙特阿拉伯修筑经过外约但通到海法的油管。在这里建筑的空军基地，可以控制欧亚菲三洲很大地区。…………谁占据了它，谁就可以把中东近东一带挟在自己的腋下。
    英国老早就看上了这块地方。第一次世界大战后就取得了巴勒斯坦和外约但的委任统治权。在第二次大战中，它现在一九四一年五月由这里进占伊拉克。七月又进驻原为法国代管的叙利亚。美国则控制了黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯等地。战后阿拉伯国家（埃及、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克等）民族运动日益高涨，（埃及要求英军撤退，伊拉克要求修改不平等的英伊条约…………）英国要维持它在中东的霸权，就更抓紧了巴勒斯坦不肯松手。
    当第一次大战后国联把巴勒斯坦委任英国统治时，当地有犹太人七万五千，阿拉伯人五十万。现在，有犹太人五十五万，阿拉伯人一百十一万。犹太人总想回到这圣地来重建他们的祖国，巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人则唯恐犹太人多了他们成为少数民族。英国就利用这一点矛盾，像他统治印度所用的惯技一样，尽力挑拨当地两个民族之间的恶感。有时候帮助犹太人说话，有时候给阿拉伯人加一把力。反来复去，无非是要制造他们的对立，削弱他们的力量，以便自己统治。
    美国插进一只脚之后，巴勒斯坦的纷争就更复杂，形势就更严重。——杜鲁门是抓住了犹太人做工具来干的。他借口解决欧洲犹太难民问题，发起组织一个所谓“英美巴勒斯坦调查委员会”，调查后发表“报告”，“建议”每年准十万犹太难民移入巴勒斯坦。这显然是由美方主谋的，他们想借此增强犹太人在巴勒斯坦的地位，再从犹太人手中掌握巴勒斯坦。这建议发表后阿拉伯国家强烈反对；英国政府正需要抓取阿拉伯人以稳固中东霸权，不愿激怒阿拉伯人，更不愿把巴勒斯坦的实际支配权拱手送人，所以并没有采纳这建议。这样，就引起了两国之间激烈的争辩乃至互相谩骂。这时候，巴勒斯坦的犹太人又大为不满，秘密的武装团体积极活动，甚至炸毁了英军总部。英国当局施行戒严，强力镇压。同时，在美国帮助下，一船一船的犹太人偷渡地中海要进入巴勒斯坦。华盛顿的枪膛里的弹簧，以犹太人为子弹，大力向地中海东岸射过来。而伦敦的压力则更强暴地继续加在巴勒斯坦的犹太人身上，并下令严厉取缔非法移民；于八月七日照会美国，说要把所有非法的移民送到塞浦路斯岛上关在集中营里。飞机在亚得利亚海岸上空侦察，驱逐舰在巴勒斯坦海岸巡逻，把成千成万要到巴勒斯坦去的犹太难民捉将起来。
    和强暴的压力同时，外交活动又在进行了。这一回由英国主谋，组成了一个“英美内阁委员会”，讨论的结果，提出了“巴勒斯坦联邦计划”，也就是分割巴勒斯坦的计划：分为两邦，每邦两省，两个邦都要在英国的管辖下“自治”。其中阿拉伯自治邦占地区较大，犹太自治邦站地区较小。还附了一个条件：美国需贷款二万五千万美金给阿拉伯国家，以提高他们的生活水准，使之和犹太人相等。这个方案发表后，阿拉伯人和犹太人都表示不满，美国金融资本家也提出反对。于是，白宫沉默了；好久好久才有复文送达伦敦，对“巴勒斯坦联邦”的计划不接受，也不正面拒绝，采取不合作态度。英国表示决不放弃委托统治权，要单独实行联邦计划；九月十日，单独召开了巴勒斯坦会议，但并没有得到什么结果。美国的真正态度，则是想借不合作迫使英国放弃委任统治权，一切听美国摆布。
    十月三日杜鲁门又发表声明，仍要求立即移民，无须等整个巴勒斯坦问题的解决。当晚英国外交部就对杜鲁门这个声明表示“遗憾”，说它“可能损害正在进行中的微妙谈判。十月中旬，英国又找犹太人进行临时性谈判，美国所支持的犹太事务局态度很强硬，而英国则仍然一点也不表示让步。表面上是陷入了僵局，实际上波浪依然起伏不停，炸弹声又不时在巴勒斯坦爆响；犹太人死命反对英国压迫，英军时常挨炸。阿拉伯人也猛烈反对美国干涉，向贝鲁特美国使馆投炸弹。……于是，搜查、拘捕、冲突、恐怖、戒严……地中海东岸进入准战争状态。
    正如十月初埃及开罗的《中东公论》杂志的社论所说：“引导美国的近东政策不是改善那里各国人民生活的意向，而是继续增长着的美国资本家的贪婪。”美国也并不是特别偏爱犹太人的，怎样与贪婪的独占资本家有利，他们就怎么干。就是这样，沙特阿拉伯的军队拿着美国武器开入外约但边境了。地中海东岸由准战争状态进入战争状态。英美在巴勒斯坦的角逐，已不止是威胁近东和平，而且已经开始破坏了和平。
    阿拉伯人和犹太人并没什么冤仇，在第一次大战前，他们数百年间都是和好相处的。近些年来，阶级的友爱填补着民族的隔阂，工人与进步分子的团结更是一天天密切。没有英国在制造磨擦，没有美国来混水摸鱼，这里该是风平浪静的。而如今，当地的人民，却在帝国主义者的野心下做了牺牲品。埃及等八个阿拉伯国家曾联名向联合国请求讨论巴勒斯坦问题。按照联合国宪章旧国联委任统治地的命运，是应由联合国及当地人民共同决定的。
