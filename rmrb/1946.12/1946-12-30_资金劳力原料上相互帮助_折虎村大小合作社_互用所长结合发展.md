　　Mutual Assistance in Capital, Labor, and Raw Materials:
    Zhehe Village's Large and Small Cooperatives
    Combine Strengths for Joint Development
    [Reported by This Newspaper] Under the leadership and promotion of Comrade Yao Dezeng, manager of the Zhehe Village Large Cooperative in the Ninth District of Xingtai, this year has seen active support for the development of small cooperatives in eight villages, including Huazi, Zhengzhuang, and Anshang, earning the support of the masses in each village. In addition to regularly providing financial support to the small cooperatives, the Zhehe Village Large Cooperative also supplies them with large quantities of tools and raw materials. It distributes all the cotton of the large cooperative to the small cooperatives, purchases weaving machines for each small cooperative, and sells cloth for them at the original price. This autumn, Jin Fuying and other small cooperatives wanted to reel silk but lacked capital. The large cooperative immediately provided some capital to help them reel silk and found sales channels for them, resulting in a profit of 10,000 yuan. The large cooperative also helped Jin Liansheng and Li Shunbin's two small cooperatives each establish a vinegar workshop; helped Yao Lianxi's small cooperative find transportation for goods and outlets, enabling them to earn a profit of more than 10,000 yuan; and further helped Anshang, Huazi, and other eight villages establish more than 30 small textile cooperatives. The large cooperative invests in the small cooperatives, with the large cooperative accounting for one share and the small cooperative accounting for two shares. When distributing profits, after deducting all expenses, the profits are divided according to a 25/75 split, with the large cooperative taking 25 percent and the remaining 75 percent distributed to the members of the small cooperatives. The leadership method of the Zhehe Village Large Cooperative towards the small cooperatives is: use talent according to ability, and support the small cooperatives in whatever they are capable of doing. Only in this way can the demands of the masses be grasped. The large cooperative also constantly informs the small cooperatives of prices in various places, provides economic intelligence, and holds regular meetings to study and guide the small cooperatives. Whatever should be done at this time, and what can make money, they call on the small cooperatives to do, developing their strengths, under the unified guidance of the large cooperative, so that all the small cooperatives develop around the large cooperative. As a result of doing so, the small cooperatives have developed, and the business scope of the large cooperative has also expanded, earning more profits. At the same time, the personnel of the large cooperative can be reduced a lot, so the expenses of the cooperative can be greatly reduced, relatively increasing profits; this is a good way for large and small cooperatives to help each other and benefit each other. In addition, small cooperatives are generally very developed during the slack farming season, but often lack capital, so the large cooperative should try to help them as much as possible at this time. During the busy farming season, most of the small cooperatives have no time to operate, so they can transfer their capital to the large cooperative. This method was generally recognized as the best way to run a cooperative at the Xingtai County Heroes Conference. Comrade Yao Dezeng put it well, "If the large cooperative separates from the small cooperatives, the large cooperative becomes an empty shell and has nothing to do."

　　资金劳力原料上相互帮助
    折虎村大小合作社
    互用所长结合发展
    【本报讯】邢台九区折虎村大合作社，在经理姚德增同志的领导与推动下，今年一年内，积极扶助了本村及周围村庄滑子、郑庄、安上等八个村的小型合作社的发展，得到了各村群众的拥护。折虎村大合作社除经常在经济上支持各小合作社外，并大量供给小合作社以工具及原料，他把大合作社的棉花全发给小合作社，给每个小合作社代购了织布机，并代他们出卖布匹，按原价交给他们。靳富英等的小各作社，今秋想打丝没有本钱，大合作社即拿了一部分资本，帮助他们打丝，并替他们找到了销路，结果获红利一万元。大合作社还帮助靳连生及李顺彬等的两个小合作社各成立醋房一座；帮助姚连西小合作社，找到运输货物和出路，使他们赚利一万多元；更帮助安上、滑子等八个村庄建立了卅多个小型纺织合作社。大合作社给各小合作社投资，是大合作社算一股，小型合作社算两股，分红时除去所有消耗，按二五分红，大合作社抽百分之廿五，其余的百分之七十五归小合作社社员分。折虎村大合作社对各小合作社的领导方法是：量材使用，小合作社能干啥就扶助他干啥，这样才能抓住群众要求。大合作社并随时告诉小合作社各地的物价，供给经济情报，定期的共同开会研究，来指导小合作社。这时应该干啥，干啥能赚钱，就叫各小合作社来干啥，发扬它们的特长，由大合作社统一指导，叫所有的小合作社围绕着大合作社来发展。这样做的结果，小合作社发展了，大合作社的经营范围也日益扩大，获利更多；同时，大合作社的人员也可以因而减少好多，那么，合作社的开支也就可以大大减低，相对的增加了盈利；这是大小合作社互助互利的好办法。另外，农闲时小合作社一般的很发达，往往缺少资本，这时大合作社就要尽量帮助他们；而在农忙时，小合作社大半均无暇经营，这时就可以把他们的资本转入到大合作社来。对于这种办法，在邢台县群英大会上，被大家公认为是办合作社最好的道路，姚德增同志说得好，“大合作社要脱离开小合作社，大合作社就成了空架子，也就没事干了。”
