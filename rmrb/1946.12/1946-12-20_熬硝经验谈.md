　　Experiences in Boiling Saltpeter
　　·Taihang Military Commission·
　　　　　　１. Collecting Saltpeter Soil:
　　Generally, saltpeter soil can be found inside dilapidated temples, at the base of old walls, near toilets, at the base of earthen cliffs, and in damp places. Saltpeter soil near toilets is the best. Soil containing saltpeter is more moist than regular soil, very fine, and seems to have an oily texture. The soil is very loose and has a white, cotton-like appearance. Put a little on your tongue; if it tastes bitter, cool, and slightly tongue-numbing (spicy), it is good saltpeter soil. Soil that is only bitter is second-best, and soil that is only salty is the worst. Put some soil powder on hot charcoal, or use charcoal fire to burn the white mold on the soil; if it ignites quickly, it also proves that there is saltpeter. Saltpeter soil should be scraped every five to seven days. Each time, use an iron shovel to scrape from the ground to a depth of three to five fen. For saltpeter soil at the base of walls or cliffs, generally sweeping is sufficient. Winter and spring are the best times for sweeping and scraping.
　　　　　　２. Mixing with Ash:
　　The best ashes for mixing with saltpeter soil are those from artemisia, pumpkin vines, hemp stalks, sorghum stalks, ground grass, and grain stalks. Once saltpeter soil is collected, it should be mixed with ash immediately; otherwise, the saltpeter will easily evaporate. When mixing, first crush the soil, then pour the ash on and stir evenly. For saltpeter soil with high alkali content, mix in more ash; for saltpeter soil with high saltpeter content, mix in less ash.
　　In winter, if the saltpeter soil and ash are good, one dan of soil requires one dan of ash. On cloudy days, each dan of soil can have an extra half-basket of ash added. In spring, each dan of soil requires one and a half dan of ash. Generally, a ratio of ten dan of soil to thirteen dan of ash produces better saltpeter.
　　　　　　３. Leaching Method:
　　Dig a pool in the ground and coat the sides and bottom with lime (yellow clay can also be used) to prevent leakage. Then, dig a deeper pit at the head of the pool and place a jar or basin inside to collect the saltpeter water. It is even better to use a large jar with a small hole drilled at the bottom edge instead of a pool. A layer of rice straw can be spread in the jar. When filling with saltpeter soil, fill one layer and tamp it down to prevent the soil from being too loose, but not too tight. Leave a hollow in the center at the top, pour boiling water over it, and the leached water is saltpeter water. To save firewood and water, the saltpeter water can be repeatedly leached five or six times. The method is as follows: If you are using two dou of saltpeter soil to leach, pour two buckets of water for the first leaching. Remove the soil, then add two dou of new soil, boil the saltpeter water, and pour it on for the second leaching, adding some boiling water to make up two buckets. Pour another bucket of boiling water for leaching. For the third leaching, replace with new soil again, boil the two buckets of saltpeter water and pour it over. Add water from the third bucket if necessary. Add some more boiling water to make the third bucket. Afterward, each leaching should use three buckets, but remember that the first two buckets should never be mixed with the third bucket. This can save more than half of the firewood and water.
　　　　　　４. Boiling Method:
　　Put the leached saltpeter water in a pot and boil it continuously without stopping the fire. Keep adding saltpeter water and watch diligently. When there are ripples on the water surface, and the water turns dark yellow, scooping it up and dripping it like clear oil, with saltpeter crystals forming around the drip on ironware, it is considered done. If it is hard, it is a bit overcooked. Or, put some in a bowl in the sun; if the water glistens and a layer of white frost appears on the surface when cooled in the shade, with saltpeter crystals at the bottom, stop burning the fire. After boiling, use a spoon to scoop it out and pour it into a basin covered with cloth to filter out the impurities. Cover it and place it in a cool place. It should crystallize into saltpeter crystals on the side of the bucket in about a day, preferably overnight. In winter, do not place it in the courtyard to prevent freezing. Then pour out the water, and what remains is saltpeter. The poured-out brine should not be discarded; it can be used to make tofu or used again next time.
　　　　　　５. Refining Method:
　　The initially boiled saltpeter contains Glauber's salt and a small amount of salt and other impurities, making it easily damp. It is not very effective when made into gunpowder and is prone to danger. Therefore, it needs to be refined. To refine, first put the saltpeter into a pot and pour in cold water, enough to cover the saltpeter. Then bring the water to a boil, stirring the water with a ladle or other tool to dissolve the saltpeter. Use a brush to dip glue water and sprinkle it in the pot, causing the impurities in the saltpeter water to float or sink to the bottom. Use something to scoop them out. Sprinkle and scoop several times until the impurities are removed. Then, pour it into a basin as before and let it cool to crystallize, resulting in pure white refined saltpeter. Note that when scooping out the water, the dirt at the bottom of the pot should never be taken. The glue water used should be skin glue, dissolved in warm water to make a light, diluted glue water.

　　Editor's note: This experience talk is based on that of the Taihang Military Commission, combined with the opinions of saltpeter boiling experts such as Huang Shugui from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the original manuscript of Mr. Hengsha. It is hoped that it will be helpful for self-defense and production. If others have better experiences, they can also be put forward to further develop our "practical folk science" (the compilation of mass production experience).

　　熬硝经验谈
   ·太行武委会·
            １、搜集硝土：
    一般的在破庙内、老墙根、厕所附近、土崖根、潮湿地方都有硝土，厕所附近的硝土最好。含硝的土比一般土湿，很细腻，好像带有油性，土质很松，带有白色，像棉花绒一样。掇一点放在舌头上，如果发苦发凉略觉撒舌头（辣嘴）是好硝土；光苦不辣的次之，光咸的最次。拿土末螫在红炭上，或是用炭火试烧土上的白霉衣，能忽忽燃烧的，也证明有硝。硝土每七天到五天刮一次。每次用铁铲从地面上刮三分至五分深。墙根或山崖根的硝土，一般用帚扫扫就可以。扫刮的时间，冬天春天最好。
            ２、拌灰：
    拌硝土的灰，以蒿、南瓜藤、大麻杆、高粱杆、地草、谷杆等灰最好。硝土一弄到，立刻要拌灰，不然硝就容易蒸发掉，拌时先把土捻碎，将灰倒上搅匀就可以了。含碱大的硝土，多拌些灰，含硝多的硝土少拌些灰。
    在冬天若是好硝土、好灰，一担土，一担沙就行，在阴天每担土可多加灰半箩头。在春天每担土得一担半灰。一般比例是十担土，十三担灰出硝较好。
            ３、淋法：
    在地下挖一个池子，用石灰（黄胶泥亦可）把邦和底抹一下，防止漏水。再在池头挖一较深的坑，内放上缸或盆接硝水。用大缸在底边上钻一小孔，代替池子，就更好。可以在缸里铺一层谷草，装上硝土，装硝土时要装一层踏一下，不使硝土太松，但也莫太紧。上面中间留一个窝子，用滚开水浇上，淋下就是硝水。要想省柴省水，可以把硝水反复重淋五六次。方法如下：如用二斗硝土来淋，第一次淋两桶，挖去土，再装二斗新土，把硝水烧开，第二次浇上重淋，添些开水淋够二桶。另外浇开水淋一桶。第三次，又换装新土，把两桶硝水烧开淋过，不足时用第三桶里硝水补上。另增些开水，淋成第三桶。以后每次都淋三桶，但切记头两桶总不要和第三桶相混。这样可省柴、水一半以上。
            ４、熬法：
    把淋下的硝水放在锅内，不歇火地熬，继续往里加硝水，并要勤看着，见水上有波汶，水成了深黄色，挑起来像清油一般滴，滴在铁器上周围出硝牙，就算成了。若是硬的就有些过火。或用碗盛一些放在太阳下，见水闪光，放在阴处一凉，水上面有一层白霜，水底下有硝牙就要停止烧火。熬好后用勺子盛出来，倒在蒙着布的盆子，滤去脏东西。放在凉处盖上，约一天的时间就可以结成硝牙，附在桶边上，最好是隔一夜。冬天不可放在院内，防止冻了。然后将水倒出，剩下的就是硝了，倒出的卤水不可丢了，可以点豆腐，也可以下次再用。
            ５、提硝法：
    初熬成的硝含有芒硝和少量食盐等脏东西，容易受潮，制成火药效力不大，易出危险，因此要提炼一下。提时先将硝放进锅内，倒上冷水，水以淹住硝为宜，然后把水烧开，用杓子或其他东西搅水，使硝化开，把胶水用刷子蘸着洒在锅内，使硝水内的脏物浮起或沉底，再用东西捞出来，这样洒几次捞几次，到杂质去净时，可舀在盆内如前法放凉结晶，即成洁白的净硝。注意，舀出水时，锅底的脏物，决不可要。所用胶水，用皮胶，拿温水化开，成为淡稀胶水就行。                                                
    编者按：这篇经验谈是以太行武委会的为主，综合陕甘宁边区熬硝能手黄书贵等及恒沙先生原稿的意见而编成的，希望对自卫和生产有些帮助。别人有更好的经验，也可以提出来，使咱们的“实用土科学”（大众生产经验的整理）更加发展。
