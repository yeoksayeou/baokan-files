　　Guancheng Fourth District Cadres' Specific Division of Labor
    Launching Mass Movement to Support the War
    Peasants' Enthusiasm for Joining the War Doubles After Emancipation
    [Our newspaper, Jilu Yu, 20th dispatch] In the past, some villages in Jilu Yu, such as Xiagou Village in the Fourth District of Guancheng, after shifting from the mass movement to the great production movement, were again dominated by landlords and local bullies in many ways, which cooled the emotions of the masses and affected war support work. In order to actively support the front and win the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, the whole district enthusiastically launched the implementation of the land reform movement. The district implemented filling in the gaps, with each person averaging 3.4 mu, and the poorest villages, after adjustment, received a minimum of more than 1 mu per person. Those without houses or estates were allocated houses and estates; if there were not enough to allocate, they were given wood, bricks, tiles, and firewood. In addition, production tools such as plows, harrows, cattle, horses, and vehicles were also allocated. In order to protect their fruits, the masses launched an active movement to join the war. After Taizhuang struggled against Tai Huai Li, one of the four major local bullies (who had served as a puppet district chief), the number of militiamen in the village participating in the front increased from one to twelve, and the masses spontaneously organized new model squads, actively standing guard and keeping watch. After Xiagou Village re-launched the struggle against landlords and local bullies, the emotions of the masses were greatly uplifted. The whole village's five stone mills milled military rice day and night, carrying 2,000 jin of rice daily to support the front-line troops, and always prepared firewood and grain, ready for soldiers passing by to eat, with the old, young, weak and timid taking turns to guard, while the young and strong automatically joined the militia or stretcher bearers. The cadres of the Fourth District of Guancheng organized their forces with a specific division of labor, determining that one-third of the district cadres, a total of ten people, led by the district chief, would be responsible for participating in the war at the front. If there were fewer district cadres, they should boldly let go, trust the village activists, and trust the masses. In terms of methods, they first carried out extensive propaganda to enlighten the masses and make them actively and spontaneously support the front. The Guancheng County Committee's research on the integration of land reform and war support in the Fourth District has two points of experience: Cadres should proactively integrate land reform and war participation work. The implementation of land reform facilitates participation in and preparation for war, and at the same time, attention to scientific and rational participation in and preparation for war also helps land reform.

　　观城四区干部具体分工
    开展群运支援战争
    翻身后农民参战热情倍增
    【本报冀鲁豫廿日电】冀鲁豫过去有些村子如观城四区夏沟村，从群运转向大生产运动之后，地主恶霸分子又从多方面统治起来，使群众情绪冷了，影响战勤工作。为积极支援前线，争取爱国自卫战争胜利，全区热烈掀起贯彻土地改革运动。该区实行填平补齐，每人平均得三亩四分，最穷的村经过调剂后，最低每人得一亩以上，无房子庄院的分配房子庄院，不够分配则给木料砖瓦、柴草，此外又分配生产工具如犁耙牛马车辆等。群众为保卫果实，掀起积极参战运动。泰庄斗倒四大恶霸之一泰怀礼（曾当汉奸区长）后，该庄参加前线的民兵由一个人增至十二人，群众自动组织新模范班，积极站岗放哨。夏沟村重新开展斗争地主恶霸后，群众情绪奋然高昂，全村五盘碾子日夜碾军米，每天担两千斤米，支援前线部队，并常备柴草粮食，准备军人过路吃饭，由老少懦弱轮流看管，青壮年即自动参加民兵或担架。观城四区区干部组织力量上具体分工，确定三分之一区干部共十人，由区长负责，担负前方参战，区干少了要大胆放手，相信村的积极分子，相信群众。在方法上先开展大宣传，启发群众觉悟，使积极自动支援前线。观城县委会研究四区土地改革与战勤结合，有二点经验：干部要主动的把土地改革与参战工作结合起来。土地改革的进行，便利了参战备战，同时参战备战要注意科学化合理化，又有助于土地改革。
