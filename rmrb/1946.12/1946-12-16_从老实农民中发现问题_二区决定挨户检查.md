　　Discovering Problems from Honest Peasants
    Second District Decides on Door-to-Door Inspections
    [This newspaper's Changzhi News] The Second District of Xiangyuan convened a joint meeting of village cadres and honest peasants at the beginning of the month to examine the extent to which honest peasants had been mobilized. The cadre of Hu Yanwo Village said, "All the poor people in our village have turned over a new leaf, there are no problems." At that time, Li Yuanzhen, an honest peasant who attended the meeting, immediately said: "I haven't turned over a new leaf yet! I haven't been given any houses, land, grain, or clothes. I escaped from Shandong. My family of three still makes a living by sharecropping four mu of land. There are two other families in our village like me, all outsiders." As he spoke, he stretched out his foot and pointed, saying, "Everyone, look, I still haven't put on socks yet!" Cheng Jixing of Putou never spoke at meetings, always sitting in the corner; now he also stood up and said, "After several movements, I only bought two mu of land, and I'm still too poor to make a living." The cadres attending the meeting were greatly inspired and expressed that they would have to check door to door to ensure that every household was made whole. The district also immediately proposed: Honest peasants have all turned over a new leaf, and turning over a new leaf is considered thorough.

　　从老实农民中发现问题
    二区决定挨户检查
    【本报长治讯】襄垣二区曾于月初召开村干与老实农民联席会，检查对于老实农民的发动程度，狐燕窝村干部说：“我们村穷人都翻了身，没有问题啦”。当时到会的老实农民李元祯即说：“我还没有翻身哩！房、地、粮食、衣服什么也没分上，我是从山东逃难上来的，三口人至今还是典种人家四亩地过活，俺村像我这样还有二家，都是外来户”。说着就伸出他的脚来指着说：“大家看，我现在还没穿上袜子呢？”普头程吉星开会从不发言，总是在墙角坐着；现在也起来说：“运动了好几次，我才买了二亩地，如今还是穷的过不了日子。”到会干部受到很大启示均纷纷表示，回去还得挨户检查，一定做到户户填平。区上亦随即提出：老实农民都翻了身，翻身才算彻底。
