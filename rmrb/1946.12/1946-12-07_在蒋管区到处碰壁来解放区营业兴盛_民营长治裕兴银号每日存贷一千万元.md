　　Running into walls everywhere in the Kuomintang-controlled area, thriving business in the liberated area:
  　The privately-owned Yuxing Bank of Changzhi has daily deposits and loans of 10 million yuan
    [Report from Changzhi by our newspaper] The Changzhi branch of the Yuxing Bank of Fancun, Taigu, which is funded and operated by national capitalists, started business on the 20th of last month after more than half a month of preparation. The bank has a capital of 10 million yuan and engages in deposit and loan business (currently only commercial loans). The loan amount is tentatively set at 30,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan. To take care of loan customers, loans can be repaid as a total sum or in installments and can be borrowed and repaid at any time, which is convenient for merchants. There is an endless stream of people coming and going to make deposits and loans. According to Mr. Bai Hongsheng, the manager of the bank, "Now the daily deposits and loans are more than 10 million yuan, and the daily profit can be more than 20,000 yuan." Manager Bai is from Taigu County. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, he worked at the Zhengxin Yuxing Bank in Taigu City. Unfortunately, it was annexed by the enemy. Mr. Bai left in anger and failed to set up a bank in Sichuan. This year, he went to Peiping to set up a bank but also failed. Finally, with the help of the democratic government and all parties, he set up a bank in the liberated area and started business, which finally gained development. From his own experience, Manager Bai believes that "only under the policy of the democratic government to support private enterprises can a bank be freely opened." He is now actively preparing for the Xingtai branch.

　　在蒋管区到处碰壁来解放区营业兴盛
  　民营长治裕兴银号每日存贷一千万元
    【本报长治讯】民族资本家集资经营之太谷范村裕兴银号长治分号，经半月余筹备，已于上月二十日开始营业。该号资金一千万元，经营存款、贷款（现仅商业贷款）等业务。贷款数目暂定为三万元至五十万元，为照顾贷款户，可总贷零还，随贷随还，商民皆感便利。来往存贷款者络绎不绝。据该号经理白鸿声先生说：“现在每天存款贷款均在千万元以上，每日可获利二万余元”。白经理系太谷县人，抗战前任职太谷城正心裕银号，不幸被敌人吞并，白先生愤慨离去，到四川设号未成；今年曾赴北平设号又未成，终于在民主政府及各方帮助下设号于解放区营业，始获得发展。白经理从亲身经历中认为：“只有在民主政府扶植私人企业政策下，才能自由开设银号。”现在正积极筹备邢台分号。
