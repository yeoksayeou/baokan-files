Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 25th—After Zhao＠ County (formerly the northern part of Pi County, now Xin County), 5th District, put forward the slogan "Men support the front lines, women take charge of land distribution," the entire district, based on joint defense units, sent young men to support the front lines. The women in each village carried out land reform. After a month, the policy of 'land to the tiller' was realized. After the masses obtained land, their enthusiasm for supporting the front lines became even more fervent. Often, more than a thousand people served both at the front and in the rear. After Fu Wanglan, a woman from Huayuan Village, obtained three mu of land, she voluntarily guided the troops at night. Li, a blind man from Xiacun Village, obtained three mu of land and specially composed a drum song to sing everywhere.

　　男子支援前线
    妇女担任分田
    【新华社山东二十五日电】赵＠县（新县原邳县北部）五区提出：“男子支援前线，妇女担任分田”口号后，全区即以联防为单位，青壮年前去支援前线，各村由农妇进行土地改革，历时一月，实现了耕者有其田。群众得地后，支援前线情绪更趋热烈，经常有千余群众在前后方服务。花园村妇女傅王兰获地三亩后，自动在深夜替部队领路。下村盲人李某得地三亩，特编鼓词到处说唱。
