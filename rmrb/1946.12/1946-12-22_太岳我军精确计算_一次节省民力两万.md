　　Taiyue Our Army's Precise Calculations
    Save 20,000 Civilian Laborers in One Instance
    [Report from Taiyue, 18th of this month] Our army, during the Jiangyuan highway operation, fully emphasized cherishing civilian labor and establishing the idea that war is for the people and, for long-term war, the waste and fatigue of civilian labor must be overcome. Therefore, this time a total of 20,000 civilian laborers were saved, and the task of supporting the front was successfully completed. The following are some experiences: First, the government's mobilization of civilian labor was based on the premise of obeying the support of the war while saving civilian labor. The civilian labor required for the war was fully calculated and prepared. For example, for guides, the government found 75 farmers who were most familiar with the road terrain in advance and assigned them to various combat troops, which not only made the army feel convenient in its actions, but also avoided temporary random searches and assignments, overcoming chaos and actually saving civilian labor. Second, the army carried forward the fine tradition of cherishing the people. Before the army's offensive departure, all commanders and fighters brought their own dry rations, saving 2,000 civilian laborers. Military and political leaders personally checked this. Director Sun checked the directly subordinate teams at the time of the troops' departure and found that three civilian laborers could be saved, and he immediately sent three villagers back. In the 409th Unit, Battalion Commander Li Guangfu gave the livestock to the sick to ride in order to save civilian labor, and also carried the luggage of the sick. Third, the use of civilian labor must be very scientifically calculated. First, Yangcheng improved the stretchers, wrapping wooden sticks with ropes. This kind of soft stretcher can save one civilian laborer per set, and there are three other benefits: easy to carry; light to lift; and comfortable for the wounded. The stretcher team went to the front twice, bringing ammunition and combat tools from the rear without sending additional porters, saving 10,500 civilian laborers. The transportation of military equipment was based on the size, weight, and distance of the equipment, and the required civilian labor was accurately calculated, rather than proposing a general average number. An average number might have the two disadvantages of being wasteful or insufficient. Fourth, the allocation of civilian labor was unified under the logistics headquarters. The civilian labor required by the troops was decided at the combat meeting and introduced to the logistics headquarters to receive. The logistics headquarters grasped the degree of mobilization of villagers in each district, made adjustments, and made the allocation of civilian labor more balanced.

　　太岳我军精确计算
    一次节省民力两万
    【本报太岳十八日电】我军在绛垣公路作战时，由于军政领导方面充分注意爱惜民力，树立起战争是为了人民。为了长期战争必须克服民力浪费和疲惫，因此，此次总计节省民力两万，并顺利完成了支援前线的任务，有以下几点经验：第一、政府对于民力动员，是在服从支援战争前提下节省民力，战争所需要的民力做到充分的计算和准备。例如响导，政府事先就找好七十五个对道路地形最熟悉的农民，分配给各个作战部队，既不使军队感到行动上的不便，又避免临时乱找乱派，克服混乱，实际上便是节省民力。第二、军队发扬了爱民的优良传统。在军队进攻出发前，全体指战员自带一部干粮，就节省民力两千，如军政首长做到亲自检查。孙主任在部队出发时检查直属队可节省三个民力，立刻让三个老乡回去。四○九部队，李广夫营长为了节省民力把牲口给病号骑，还将病号的行李驮上。第三、使用民力要很科学的计算，首先是阳城改良了担架，用木棍缠上绳索，此种软担架每付可节省一个民力，还有三个好处：携带容易；抬时轻便；伤员舒服。两次担架队开赴前线，从后方把弹药及作战工具带上，未另派民夫，即节省民力一万零五百个。关于军用器材的搬运是按器材大小、重量，路程远近，精确计算后，所需的民力，不是笼统的提出一个平均数字，平均数字有可能浪费或不足的两个缺点。第四、民力分配统一于后勤指挥部，部队所需民力在作战会议上决定，介绍到后勤指挥部去领，后勤指挥部掌握了各区村民夫动员程度，加以调整，使民力分配平均。
