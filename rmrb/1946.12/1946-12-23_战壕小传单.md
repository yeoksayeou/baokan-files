　　Trench Leaflet
    Xia Chuan
    During the "He Zheng" Third Detachment, First Battalion's attack on Lao'an, a handwritten leaflet circulated among the squads in the positions. One was a report of the victory in annihilating the 374th Regiment of the Chiang troops in Huangzhuang, and the other was a quick-rhyme poem, "Resolutely Take Lao'an." The leaflet had a drawing of a soldier in the upper left corner, holding up a five-pointed star. To the right of the star, a line of small characters read: "Little meteor, everyone should see, person to person, squad to squad, hand to hand, spread throughout the company, good news is all clear." Below the blank space was the full text of the quick-rhyme poem: "The first shot, rings out loud, captured He Guansan; two brigade headquarters were wiped out, the Huangzhuang enemy is finished; a snake without a head cannot walk, a thief without a head is sure to be in chaos; everyone must work harder, sharpen bayonets to advance into Lao'an; last night the fighting turned the sky red, the enemy trembled with fear; tonight, we will fight, see who captures the most machine guns? See who is the bravest? Be brave and tenacious to capture prisoners, overcome all difficulties; new and old comrades work together, strive to be a hero of course." This type of leaflet was copied and distributed one per company, and read aloud by soldiers with higher levels of education in each squad during breaks in the fighting during the day, which was indeed a good method of front-line mobilization work.

　　战壕小传单
    夏川
    在“和政”三中队一大队进攻老岸时，在阵地里流传着一种班内传诵手抄的小传单。有一个是歼灭黄庄蒋军三七四团的捷报，另一个是“坚决拿下老岸”的快板。小传单，左上角画一战士，手托着一个五角星，五星右面的一行小字，写着：“小流星，都要看，人传人，班传班，手递手，传遍连，好消息都了然。”下面的空白抄着快板全文：“头一炮，打的响，活捉了一个何冠三；两个旅部被解决，黄庄敌人完了蛋；蛇无头，不能走，贼无头，一定乱；大家更要加油干，磨亮刺刀进老岸；昨夜打得老天红，敌人吓得打颤颤；今晚上，咱要干，看谁缴的机枪多？看谁动作最勇敢？勇猛顽强捉俘虏，克服一切的困难；新老同志齐努力，争取英雄理当然。”这种小传单每连抄发一份，由各班文化程度高的战士，在白天战斗间隙里朗读，确是火线鼓动工作的一种好办法。
