　　Experience in Organizing Logistics Work
　　An Ming, Director of the Taihang Third Military Subdistrict Military Committee

　　To avoid wasting and exhausting civilian labor, saving civilian labor while completing the task of supporting the front lines should be the guiding principle of logistics work. The long duration of the war, the suddenness of battles, and the constant changes on the battlefield have added many difficulties to logistics work. However, these difficulties must be resolved in order to achieve final victory. Based on the situation of this operation west of the Pinghan Railway, the following experiences have been gained:

　　(1) Establish Mass Participation in the War Ideology and Organizational Preparation

　　Due to the long duration and suddenness of the war, civilian labor needs to be concentrated quickly, but long-term concentration easily exhausts civilian labor. Therefore, during the short gaps in the war, civilian labor should be quickly demobilized. Logistics work should be done in such a way that it is available when needed and disappears when not needed. Lin County can gather 600 stretchers within 24 hours and send them to the battlefield 60 miles away. After demobilizing and returning in the morning, they can gather 300 stretchers to a location 30 miles away on the same day. This not only completes the task but also saves civilian labor. It also does not expose our military intentions and dispels the front-line troops' fear of unreliability, preventing them from keeping stretchers. To achieve this: First, in the mass movement and participation in the war, the ideology of mass participation in the war must be established. Before demobilization, use short periods to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each action, criticize, educate, and commend heroic models to prepare a foundation for the next mobilization. Second is robust organizational structure. Lin County has a fixed system for stretcher squads, battalions, commanders, and supply personnel during peacetime. Cadres are familiar with team members, and team members trust cadres, so they can set off immediately upon receiving orders. Third, county districts should control communication and transportation tools, using telephone transportation teams to quickly relay orders to districts and villages upon arrival. Fourth, the masses themselves should be prepared with clothes, dry food, and shoes, and especially ensure that their families and production are taken care of, so they do not feel difficulties after departure. Without family worries, they can naturally participate in the war with peace of mind and enthusiasm. In short, the more thorough the preparations during peacetime, the more civilian labor can be saved. Otherwise, fear of unreliability and a slow response will lead to increased and wasteful mobilization of civilian labor.

　　(2) Fully Estimate the Needs of the War and Actively Support the War

　　Saving civilian labor must be subordinate to supporting the war, not meeting the needs of the war under the premise of saving civilian labor. Therefore, the civilian labor required for the war must be fully estimated to ensure preparedness and avoid temporary chaos. Experience has shown that districts and villages that are prepared can easily carry out their work and maintain good relationships; districts and villages that are not prepared will experience wartime chaos, work stoppages, and mutual complaints. For planned preparation, the number of civilians must be accurately calculated. The mobilization range should be large, but the number mobilized should be small. In and near the battlefield, the number mobilized should generally not exceed 5% of the population. Reserve temporary mobile forces. If the mobilization is too large, and temporary tasks arise, distant mobilization will be required. Distant water cannot quench immediate thirst, which may affect the war mission. This time, we used stretchers and militia from Lin County as the basic force, and mobilized near the battlefield to complete temporary tasks, which was necessary and correct. When the mobilization range is large, it is easier to take care of the production and families of the participants, and the participating masses are more at ease. When Dongyao in Lin County was occupied by the puppet army, the morale of the participating masses was not greatly affected. They said, "It doesn't matter, someone at home is taking care of things; the militia are fighting the enemy at home, so we are not afraid."

　　(3) Unified Leadership of Civilian Labor and Separate Supply Needs

　　Although the scale of this campaign was not very large, the troops and regions were quite complex. The supply of militia was unified under the distribution of the logistics headquarters. When troops needed supplies, they should obtain them from the logistics headquarters unless absolutely necessary. This was correct. However, some troops intercepted stretchers on the road and requisitioned stretchers from three districts, which affected the calculation, mobilization, and distribution of civilian labor. This should be corrected. However, when the front lines are extended and time is short, each sub-command can temporarily mobilize and supply the needs of the war, in addition to the pre-allocated civilian labor. The number and situation of mobilization and distribution by each sub-command need to be reported to the command headquarters regularly. The command headquarters must frequently understand the mobilization and distribution of civilian labor in various places to plan and control effectively.

　　(4) Seize War Gaps and Organize Participating Personnel to Produce

　　The combination of participation in the war and production is also a concrete way to save civilian labor. During this operation, 300 stretchers from She County used a one-day gap to transport 30,000 catties of cotton and a piece of machinery, earning 300,000 yuan in compensation. Fifty stretchers from Lin County earned 150,000 yuan by transporting cotton. The Lin County militia helped the masses thresh, gin cotton, and harvest crops, the masses provided consolation food, and they saved funds by collecting firewood themselves to improve their lives. This first, protected the assets of our area, second, closely linked the participants with local residents, and third, in addition to improving their lives, each person could also receive some dividends. Most importantly, it considerably reduced the separate mobilization of manpower for transporting materials, playing a significant role in saving overall civilian labor.

　　(5) Pay Attention to Several Issues to Reduce Casualties

　　The complex and changeable war situation, enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, had the greatest impact on the morale of the participating masses. Therefore, first, provide military air defense education. When 200 stretchers from Lin County were transferred, partial camouflage minimized losses from machine-gun fire, and they could quickly regroup. Because 300 stretchers from She County had received prior education, they were not injured by enemy aircraft strafing on Mount Luokuang. Second, prepare medical and health personnel. Although sick individuals constantly appeared in Lin (County) and She (County) this time, they were treated promptly, minimizing casualties. Third, communication and liaison: The battlefield changes rapidly, and it is easy to lose contact. The Lin and She County headquarters established reception and liaison stations in later locations, which played a significant role. Fourth, report the situation frequently to strengthen the confidence of the masses. Fifth, timely commendations and rewards, as well as rear area condolences and care. Some stretchers from Lin County departed too hastily, and some stayed too long. The districts promptly sent clothes and shoes, which played a significant role in consolidating morale.

　　Finally, the troops and logistics agencies must have a consistent understanding. Logistics agencies should ensure the completion of tasks and supply the needs of the war; troops should trust the logistics agencies and overcome individual phenomena of wasting civilian labor.

　　组织后勤工作经验
    太行三分区武委会主任  安明
    为避免民力的浪费与疲惫，在完成支援前线任务的原则下节省民力，应是后勤工作的指导方针。战争的长期，战斗的突然，和战场的不断变动，给后勤工作增加了不少困难。但这一困难必须解决，才能取得最后胜利。依平汉路西这次作战的情形，有以下经验：
  　（一）树立群众参战思想与组织准备
    由于战争的长期和突然，要求民力迅速的集中，但长期集中，民力又易疲惫。因此在战争短的空隙中，民力应迅速的复员。后勤工作应作到什么时候需要，什么时候就有；什么时候不用，什么时候就没有。林县在二十四小时之内，可集中六百付担架，到六十里外的战场上。在早上复员回去后，又能于同天内集结三百付担架到三十里以外去。既可完成任务，又可节省民力。也不暴露我们的军事企图，也能使前方部队打消因怕靠不住而留下担架不放的想法。这样：第一，须在群众运动中，在参战行动中，树立群众的参战思想，在复员前利用短时间总结每次行动优缺点，批评、教育与表扬奖励英雄模范，给下次动员准备好基础。第二是健民组织。林县平时的担架中队、大队、指挥、供卫人员，都有一定的制度。干部熟悉队员，队员相信干部，接到命令后，马上即可出发。第三是县区掌握通讯交通工具，利用电话交通队，命令到达时，马上即可下达区村。第四，要群众本身有准备：衣服、干粮、鞋子，特别是家庭和生产都有人照顾，出发后不感困难。没有家庭顾虑，自然可安心积极的参战。总之，平时的准备工作愈周到，愈能节省民力。否则怕靠不住，缓不济急，愈大量调动，愈浪费民力。
  　（二）充分估计战争需要，主动支援战争。
    节省民力必须服从于支援战争，而不是在节省民力前提下应付战争需要。因之，对战争所需要的民力，必须加以充分估计，才能有准备，不至临时乱抓。经验证明：凡有准备的区村，工作很易进行，关系也好；凡没准备的区村，便发生战时混乱现象，工作停顿，互相埋怨。为了准备有计划，必须对民力有精确的计算。动员面应大，动员数量要少。在战场及其附近，动员数量一般的不应超过人口百分之五。预备下临时的机动力量。如动员过大，则临时任务来了，又须远调，远水不解近渴，可能影响战争任务。我们此次把林县担架、民兵作为基本力量，战场附近动员完成临时任务，这是需要的对的。动员面大时，参战人员的生产及家庭照顾也较容易，参战群众更易安心。林县东姚被伪军占领，参战群众情绪未受大影响，说：“不要紧，家里有人照顾；家庭有民兵打敌人，不怕。”
　  （三）统一民力领导与分别供给需要
    此次战役规模虽不很大，部队及地区颇为复杂，民兵供应统一于后勤指挥部的分配，部队需用时，非万不得已时，应到后勤指挥部去领取，这是对的。但有的部队在路上扣担架，到三个区上要担架，影响了民力的计算，动员与分配，是应纠正的。但战线延长，时间来不及时，则除预给的民力外，各分指挥部可以临时动员，供给战争需要。各分指挥部动员分配的数目情况，需按时常向指挥部报告。指挥部必须经常了解各地民力动员分配情况，才能有计划的掌握。
  　（四）抓紧战争空隙，组织参战人员生产。
    参战与生产的结合，也是节省民力的具体办法之一。此次涉县三百付担架，抽出一天的空隙运棉三万斤及机器一部，得报酬三十万元。林县五十付担架运棉花得报酬十五万元。林县民兵帮助群众打场、轧花、收耕，群众慰劳费吃，自己打柴节省基金，改善生活。这样第一，保护了我区的资财，第二密切参战人员与当地居民的关系，第三，除改善了生活外，还可每人有些红利。而最主要的是相当的减少了运输物资人力的另行动员，对整个民力的节省，起了不少的作用。
  　（五）注意几个问题，减少减员。
    战争情况复杂多变，敌机轰炸扫射，影响参战群众的情绪最大。因此第一，加以军事防空教育。林县二百付担架转移时因部分有伪装，遭机枪射击损失不大，能迅速集合。涉县三百付担架因事先有教育，在罗筐山上过敌机扫射未伤人。第二是医药卫生人员的准备，林（县）涉（县）此次病号虽不断发生，但都及时医治，减员不大。第三是通讯联络：战场多变，很易失掉联络，林、涉县指挥部均在较后的地点设立收容联络站，起很大作用。第四，多报告情况，坚定群众信心。第五是及时表扬与奖励及后方慰问照顾，林县担架有的出发过于仓促，有的时间稍长，区上及时送去衣服、鞋子，对巩固情绪起不少作用。
    最后部队和后勤机关，在认识上必须一致起来。后勤机关应保证完成任务，供给战争需要；部队应相信后勤机关，克服个别浪费民力现象。
