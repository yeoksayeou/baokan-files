Model of Mass Work
The First Platoon of the Fifth Company of the Sixth Zero Four Seven Unit Conscientiously Implements the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention
[Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 2nd report] The first platoon of the fifth company of the sixth zero four seven unit adopted the method of helping the masses with their work first and then conducting propaganda. During the Longhai Self-Defense Campaign, whenever they arrived at a campsite, they would start by sweeping the floor and cleaning the courtyard. After dinner, they would wash the landlord's pot and fetch water. After waking up, they would put up the door panels. Later, the people of Xigangtou (near Lanfeng) all knew they were the Eighth Route Army and said, "We've only heard about you, but we've never seen you. After walking all day, you still carry water and sweep the floor for us. You really are the people's army!" Then they conducted propaganda among the masses. Because the squad leader was an old comrade and knew that the Eighth Route Army had many things to do, he promoted the idea that Chiang Kai-shek was selling out the country and that the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party were saving the country and serving the people. The new comrades from the Liberated Areas knew less about the past, so they talked about the mass struggle and the liberation of the masses in the Liberated Areas. The comrades who were liberated in the Ping-Han Campaign talked about how the Eighth Route Army didn't beat or scold people, and how the Central Army oppressed the common people, using their own personal experiences to talk to the masses. After the propaganda, the people figured out the truth and automatically called back the few villagers who had run away, thinking the Chiang army was coming, saying, "Our own troops are here, what's there to be afraid of?" They also told the troops, "Before you came, there were some bandits here who wore military uniforms and plain clothes. Once, when the New Fourth Army came here looking for guides, those plainclothes bandits went to guide them, and then they started fighting in the woods! You have to be careful too!" The troops were deeply moved. In order to strengthen the relationship between the army and the people and to take care of the fatigue of the troops, the unit's democratic discussion stipulated that if they marched sixty li in one day, they only needed to fetch water, wash their feet, and sweep the floor. If they marched forty li, they would ensure that the landlord's water tank was full.

　　群众工作的模范
    六○四七部队五连一排认真执行三大纪律八项注意
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】六○四七部队五连一排，采取先帮群众做活后宣传的办法。他们在陇海自卫战役中，每到宿营地时就动手扫地清院，饭后替房东洗锅、挑水，睡起来就上门板，后来西岗头（兰封附近）老百姓都知道他们是八路军，就说：“光听说，就没见过你们。走了一天路，还给我们担水扫地，你们真是老百姓的队伍！”他们便向群众进行宣传。因为班长是老同志，知道八路军事情多，就宣传蒋介石卖国、八路军共产党救国为民的主张；解放区的新同志知道事情少，就讲解放区群众斗争，群众翻身的事；平汉战役解放过来的同志，就讲八路军不打人不骂人，中央军压迫老百姓的事，拿自己切身的经历，给群众谈。宣传以后，老百姓摸清了底细，自动把少数以为蒋军来了，跑走的老乡都招呼回来说：“自己队伍来了，怕个啥。”并对部队同志说：“你们没来以前，这里有些土匪穿军褂也穿便衣，有一次新四军到这里要带路的，那些便衣土匪就去带路，到树林里就打起来！你们也要小心呀！”部队同志们深受感动。为了密切军民关系和照顾部队疲劳，这次该部民主讨论规定：凡一天行军六十里只是挑水洗脚扫地就行了，行军四十里，一定保证房东水满缸。窆叵岛驼展瞬慷悠＠停?獯胃貌棵裰魈致酃娑ǎ悍惨?天行军六十里只是挑水洗脚扫地就行了，行军四十里，一定保证房东水满缸。
