　　On Legitimacy
    Fan Wenlan
    What is legitimacy? A vague concept floats in people's minds, and this is not surprising. However, traitors and despots use people's confused notions to conceal their crimes. Chiang Kai-shek is one of them, and the most cunning one. Clarifying the issue of legitimacy will help people further recognize Chiang's crimes.

  (I) Basic Conditions for Legitimacy
    Before the Xinhai Revolution, going back to the early Western Zhou Dynasty, the Han people called their motherland China (see the "Zicai" chapter of the Book of Documents), and national sovereignty was exclusively owned by the Han people. That was a feudal society, and the peasant class could not organize a peasant government. The government that exercised national sovereignty, the so-called dynasty, could only be an autocratic monarchical government under the dictatorship of the landlord class. (See Bogu's translation of "The Development of the Monistic View of History," Liberation Edition, p. 160.) Therefore, the vast peasant class did not demand democracy from the landlord government (although many political theorists from Confucius and Mencius onward mentioned democratic theories), but rather (1) the protection of the interests of the Han people and resistance to foreign invasions, (2) the maintenance of national unity and opposition to separatist regimes and parochialism, and (3) relatively moderate exploitation (the so-called "benevolent government" in feudal classics), so that peasants could survive. This naturally formed three basic conditions: being of the Han ethnicity, unified, and politically better. Whoever met these conditions had the right to be considered the legitimate dynasty representing Chinese sovereignty. According to the first condition, the Five Barbarians, Northern Wei, Liao, Jin, Mongol Yuan, and Manchu Qing occupied half or all of China, and their pseudo-regimes should not pretend to be Chinese dynasties. According to the second condition, the Three Kingdoms, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms were periods of warlord separatism, the Eastern Jin, Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen dynasties existed in Jiangzuo, and Zhao Gou (Emperor Gaozong of Song) of the Southern Song Dynasty called himself a vassal of the Jin Dynasty, and none of them could falsely claim legitimacy. According to the third condition, Confucius wrote in the 31st year of Duke Xiang of Spring and Autumn, "The people of Ju assassinated their ruler in Mizhou," and Zuo Zhuan said, "The fault lies with the ruler." Mencius advocated revolution, saying: "He who injures benevolence is called a thief; he who injures righteousness is called a mutilator. A person who is both a mutilator and a thief is called a mere fellow (despot). I have heard of the execution of the mere fellow Zhou, but I have not heard of the assassination of a ruler." Even feudal sages admitted that it was reasonable to revolt and kill a despot. Therefore, once a legitimate dynasty faced a large-scale peasant uprising, it lost its legitimacy.

    After the Xinhai Revolution, especially after the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese people had sufficient strength to organize their own democratic government. The democratic view of legitimacy naturally replaced the old view of legitimacy, and the old three basic conditions were naturally replaced by three new basic conditions. The first is anti-imperialist nationalism. All ethnic groups within the country are equal and jointly resist imperialist aggression. The old idea of the Han ethnicity exclusively owning China has degenerated into reactionary Han chauvinism. The second is anti-feudal democratic politics. The old idea of "benevolent government" has degenerated into a shameful means of deception. The third is democratic national unity. The old idea of unity has degenerated into an absurd policy of military unification. Based on the new three basic conditions, the so-called "central" governments since the Republic of China, namely the Northern Warlord government and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government, are all pseudo-rebellious governments, and not a trace of legitimacy can be found in them.

  (II) A Thick Cloud of Confused Ideas
    Before the Republic of China, so-called historians wrote a large number of historical books under the influence of three erroneous viewpoints. One is the viewpoint of domestic slaves. For example, Sima Guang wrote *Zizhi Tongjian* because the Northern Song Dynasty resembled Cao Wei, so he respected Cao Wei as legitimate. Zhu Xi wrote *Tongjian Gangmu* because the Southern Song Dynasty resembled Shu Han, so he respected Shu Han as legitimate. Both of them wanted to explain the legitimacy of Zhao Kuangyin's acquisition of power, and both respected the Five Dynasties as legitimate. However, the Later Tang, Later Jin, and Later Han dynasties were all alien pseudo-regimes, which violated the examples of respecting the Southern Dynasties and rejecting the Five Barbarians and Tuoba. Zhu Xi did not respect the Southern Tang Dynasty as legitimate, which also violated the example of respecting Shu Han. Sima Guang and Zhu Xi were both famous historians, and they created examples and broke examples themselves, so contradictory. The reason lies in their being domestic slaves of the Zhao family. One is the viewpoint of traitors. When alien races invaded China and established pseudo-dynasties, historians who recognized the pseudo-dynasties and wrote about Chinese dynasties or legitimate dynasties all held more or less the viewpoint of traitors. One is the viewpoint of inheritance. They followed old theories and repeated them without being aware of spreading fallacies for domestic slaves and traitors. These three viewpoints influenced the broad scholar class and created a cloud of confused ideas, making it impossible to clearly recognize the three basic conditions for legitimacy.

    After the Republic of China, warlords and comprador capitalists occupied Chinese political power, and the three erroneous viewpoints and the three degenerated old conditions for legitimacy gained an opportunity for rapid development among the conservative groups in society. The traitorous viewpoint combined with Han chauvinism became the social foundation for traitors daring to surrender externally and suppress internally. The domestic slave viewpoint combined with military unification became the social foundation for fascist bandits daring to engage in militarism and slaughter the people. The inherited viewpoint combined with deceptive means became the social foundation for political swindlers daring to openly deceive the masses. From Yuan Shikai, Duan Qirui, and Cao Kun, to Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek, one fell and another rose, harming the country and the people, and the situation worsened. The reason why this group of traitors and despots could still gain the recognition and support of some people was mainly because the thick cloud of confused ideas obscured the democratic view of legitimacy. These people mistakenly believed that the pseudo-government was the legitimate government of the Republic of China, and that it was reasonable to be loyal to the legitimate government, not knowing that they had fallen into the trap of the traitors and despots.

  (III) Chiang Kai-shek Uses Confused Ideas to Sell Bogus Medicine
    The thief Chiang Kai-shek, who stole the country and usurped the Party, opened a black shop—the Chiang Kuomintang government—with two signboards hanging at the door: "Sun Yat-sen's Direct Disciples" and "Implementing the Three Principles of the People." People with confused ideas were lured in. Now, let's take a calm look. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen led the democratic revolution at the end of the Qing Dynasty, the *Min Bao*, the organ of the Tongmenghui, drew a picture of traitors of the past and present in its twelfth issue. Zeng Guofan had a human head and a snake's body, Li Hongzhang had a human head and a fish's body, and Yuan Shikai's face was split in half. The revolutionary banner was so clear. Chiang Kai-shek worshiped traitors Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang to the point of prostration, regarding them as gods. He imitated Yuan Shikai in everything, not only a reprint but also a supplemented version. Can it be said that Chiang Kai-shek and the Chiang Kuomintang have any traditional relationship with Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui? Mr. Sun Yat-sen reorganized the Kuomintang in 1924, put forward the three major policies of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and support for workers and peasants, and published the true interpretation of the Three Principles of the People—the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang—and the Kuomintang embarked on the road of revolution again. Chiang Kai-shek suddenly rebelled against the Great Revolution, vigorously carried out anti-Soviet and anti-communist policies, slaughtered workers and peasants, and distorted the revolutionary Three Principles of the People into fascist Three Principles of the People (as evidenced by *China's Destiny*). Can it be said that Chiang Kai-shek and the Chiang Kuomintang have any traditional relationship with Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang?

    The above not only proves that Chiang Kai-shek and the Chiang Kuomintang have no legitimacy to speak of in relation to Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang. Let's take another calm look. Does the Chiang Kuomintang government meet the conditions of a legitimate government of the Republic of China? The basic condition for a legitimate government of the Republic of China is, first, anti-imperialist nationalism, but Chiang Kai-shek is precisely a thorough-going American puppet who sells out the motherland. Second, anti-feudal democratic politics, but Chiang Kai-shek is precisely the chief head of the feudal fascist gang. Third, democratic unity, but Chiang Kai-shek is precisely the chief culprit who is fond of creating chaos and determined to split China. Can it be said that the Chiang Kuomintang government has any commonality with the legitimate government of the Republic of China?

    Chiang Kai-shek is self-aware. He knows that he himself is a traitor to Sun Yat-sen, his Kuomintang reactionaries are counterfeit inferior goods of Sun Yat-sen's party, and his Kuomintang government is an illegitimate government. Today, when the democratic forces permeate the world and the Chinese people's level of awareness is unprecedentedly high, Chiang Kai-shek is guilty and scared, jumping up and down in a panic, taking risks, and boldly convening the so-called "National Assembly," attempting to play the role of a fake father and declare the legal status of his illegitimate child.

    A National Assembly composed of representatives elected by the broad masses of the people is the true father of a legitimate government. Playing the fake father act is dangerous. Yuan Shikai played a fake National Assembly once, creating a fake Hongxian emperor, and as a result, the traitor Yuan was executed in Xinhua Palace. Cao Kun played a piglet parliament once, creating a fake constitution and a fake president, and as a result, the traitor Cao rolled out of Xinhua Palace. Now Chiang Kai-shek is playing a fake National Assembly again, and it will create a series of fake things, such as a fake constitution, a fake president, a fake government, and fake orders, etc. As for the outcome, please look at the two traitors Yuan and Cao.

  (IV) The Republic of China Urgently Needs to Establish a Legitimate Government
    Chiang Kai-shek uses the fake National Assembly to manufacture a large number of fake things, with the ultimate goal of selling China as an American colony and forever acting as the head of the colonial slaves. In order to realize Sun Yat-sen's two testamentary instructions of "sovereignty resides in the people" and "returning power to the people," it is the most urgent and important task at present for the Chinese people to quickly and automatically convene a people's representative conference, discuss the great plan of saving the country and building the nation, and establish a democratic, united, and legitimate government of the Republic of China. The Chinese Communist Party, the China Democratic League, and democratic and progressive people throughout the country have consistently advocated independence, peace, and democracy. At this critical juncture of survival, they call on the people of the whole country to rescue China from Chiang's treacherous plot; undoubtedly, the 450 million people will support this sacred call.

　　论正统
    范文澜
    什么是正统，在人们头脑里，浮动着一片糊涂观念，这并不是怪事。可是民贼独夫窃国大盗却利用人们的糊涂观念，掩蔽自己的罪恶。蒋贼介石就是其中的一个，而且是最狡诈的一个。辨明正统问题，将有助于人们进一步认识蒋贼的罪恶。
  （一）正统的基本条件
    辛亥革命以前，远至西周初年，汉民族称自己的祖国为中国（见尚书梓材篇），国家主权为汉民族所独有。那是封建社会，农民阶级不可能组织农民政府。行施国家主权的政府，即所谓朝代，只能是地主阶级专政的君主专制政府。（参阅博古译《论一元论历史观之发展解放版》页一六○）因此，广大农民阶级，对地主政府的要求，不是什么民主（虽然孔孟以下不少政论家提到民主学说），而是（一）保护汉民族利益，抵抗异族侵入，（二）保持国家统一，反对割据与偏安，（三）剥削比较缓和（封建经典所谓“仁政”），农民能生活下去。这就自然形成了汉民族的，统一的，政治较好的三个基本条件。合乎此者，就有权被认为代表中国主权的正统朝代。按照第一条件，五胡、元魏、辽、金、蒙元，满清侵占中国半部或全部，僭立伪号，不得冒充中国朝代。按照第二条件，三国五代十国是群雄割据，东晋宋齐梁陈偏安江左，南宋赵构（宋高宗）对金自称藩臣，都不得妄称正统。按照第三条件，孔子在春秋襄公三十一年书“莒人弑其君密州”，左传发凡说“罪在君也”。孟子主张革命说：“贼仁者谓之贼，贼义者谓之残，残贼之人谓之一夫（独夫），闻诛一夫纣矣，未闻弑君也”。封建圣人也承认起义杀独夫是合理的。所以正统朝代，一到农民大规模起义，便丧失它的正统地位。
    辛亥革命以后，特别是五四运动以后，中国人民有足够力量组织自己的民主政府。民主主义的正统观当然要代替旧时代的正统观，旧的三个基本条件也当然被三个新的基本条件所代替。第一是反帝国主义的民族主义。国内各民族一律平等，共同反抗帝国主义的侵略，旧的汉民族独有中国思想，变质为反动的大汉族主义了。第二是反封建制度的民主政治，旧的“仁政”思想变质为可耻的欺骗手段了。第三是民主主义的全国统一，旧的统一思想变质为荒谬的武力统一政策了。根据新的三个基本条件来观察民国以来所谓“中央”政府，即北洋军阀政府与蒋介石的国民党政府，全是僭伪叛逆政府，一丝一毫也找不出正统的气味来。
  （二）一片浓厚的糊涂观念
    民国以前，所谓历史学者，在三种谬误观点的支配下，写出大量史书。一种是家奴观点，例如司马光作资治通鉴，因北宋近似曹魏，尊曹魏为正统，朱熹作通鉴纲目，因南宋近似蜀汉，尊蜀汉为正统。二人要说明赵匡胤得天下的正当，同尊五代为正统，而后唐后晋后汉三代都是异族僭号，自违尊南朝斥五胡拓跋之例。朱熹不尊南唐为正统，又自违尊蜀汉之例。司马光朱熹都是著名史家，自造例，自破例，支离矛盾如此，原因正在他们是赵姓的家奴。一种是汉奸观点。异族侵入中国，建立伪朝，凡认伪朝写中国朝代或正统朝代的史家，都或多或少抱有汉奸观点。一种是因袭观点。沿用旧说，陈陈相因，不自觉的替家奴汉奸传播谬说。这三种观点，影响到广大士人层，造成一片糊涂观念，不能清楚认识关于正统的三个基本条件。
    入民国后，军阀买办霸占中国政权，三种谬误观点与三个变了质的旧正统条件在社会守旧人群中得到飞跃发展的机会。汉奸观点结合大汉族主义成为卖国贼敢于对外投降对内镇压的社会基础。家奴观点与武力统一结合，成为法西斯匪帮敢于穷兵黩武屠杀人民的社会基础。因袭观点与欺骗手段结合，成为政治骗子敢于明目张胆愚弄群众的社会基础。从袁世凯、段祺瑞、曹锟，以至汪精卫、蒋介石，一个倒了，一个继起，祸国殃民，愈演愈烈。这一群民贼独夫的僭伪政府，所以还能获得一部分人士的承认与拥护，主要由于浓厚的糊涂观念掩蔽了民主主义的正统观。这些人士误认僭伪政府是民国的正统政府，以为对正统政府效忠是合理的，不知恰恰坠入民贼独夫的圈套里。
  （三）蒋介石利用糊涂观念卖狗皮膏
    窃国篡党大盗蒋介石，开设了一座黑店——蒋记国民党政府，门悬“孙中山嫡派信徒”，“奉行三民主义”两块招牌，糊涂观念的人们被诱惑了。现在请平心静气看一看，孙中山先生在清末领导民主革命，同盟会机关报《民报》第十二期绘过去现在汉奸图，曾国藩人头蛇身，李鸿章人头鱼身，袁世凯头面劈成两半，革命旗帜何等鲜明。蒋介石崇拜汉奸曾国藩李鸿章至于五体投地，尊若神明，对袁世凯事事效颦，不仅是再版，而且还是增补版。这能说蒋介石，蒋记国民党与孙中山同盟会有丝毫传统关系么？孙中山先生在一九二四年改组国民党，揭橥联苏联共扶持工农三大政策，发表三民主义真释——国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言——国民党重新走上革命的道路。蒋介石突然反叛大革命，厉行反苏反共屠杀工农，曲解革命三民主义成法西斯三民主义（《中国之命运》可证），这能说蒋介石、蒋记国民党与孙中山国民党有丝毫传统关系么？
    以上不仅证明蒋介石，蒋记国民党对孙中山国民党说来，根本无正统之可言。试再平心静气看一看，蒋记国民党政府有没有合于民国正统政府的条件呢？民国正统政府的基本条件，第一反帝的民族主义，而蒋介石恰恰是彻底出卖祖国的美国儿皇帝。第二反封建的民主政治，而蒋介石恰恰是封建法西斯匪帮的总头子。第三民主主义的统一，而蒋介石恰恰是好乱成性，决心分裂中国的罪魁祸首。这能说蒋记国民党政府与民国正统政府有丝毫的共同性么？
    蒋介石是有自知之明的。他知道他本人是孙中山的叛臣贼子，他的国民党反动派是孙中山党的冒牌劣货，他的国民党政府是个私生子政府。当此民主势力弥漫全世界，中国人民觉悟程度空前提高的今天，蒋介石作贼心虚，急得鸡飞狗跳，挺而走险，大胆召开所谓“国民大会”，妄图扮演出一个假爸爸，宣告私生子的合法地位。
    从广大人民选出代表来组成的国民大会，才是正统政府的真父亲。演假爸爸那出戏是危险的。袁世凯玩了一次伪国民大会，造出伪洪宪皇帝，结果袁贼伏诛在新华宫。曹锟玩了一次猪仔议会，造出伪宪法伪大总统，结果曹贼滚出新华宫。现在蒋介石又来玩伪国民大会，它将造出一联串的伪东西，如伪宪法，伪总统，伪政府，伪命令等等。结果如何，请看袁曹二贼。
  （四）中华民国急需成立正统政府
    蒋介石用伪国大制造大批伪东西，终极目的在出卖中国为美国殖民地，自己永远充当殖民地奴隶头子。我中国人民为实现孙中山“主权在民”“还政于民”两条遗教，迅速自动召集人民代表会议，商讨救亡建国大计，成立中华民国的民主联合的正统政府，实为当前最紧急最重要的任务。中国共产党，中国民主同盟暨全国民主进步人士一贯主张独立和平民主，当此危急存亡的关头，号召全国人民从蒋贼伪化毒计中把中国抢救出来；无疑的，四万万五千万人民一定要拥护这个神圣号召。
