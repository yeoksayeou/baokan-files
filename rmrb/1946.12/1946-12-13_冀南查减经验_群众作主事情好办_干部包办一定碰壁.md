(From our correspondent in Weixian, 11th) Comprehensive reports from correspondents: In the tax reduction movement in various parts of Jinnan, villages where cadres promoted democracy saw progress in their work; otherwise, the work suffered greatly. In Wangqiao and Chengjiazhuang in Longping, village cadres used to discuss issues first and then inform the group leaders of the discussion results, who would then relay them to the masses. The masses simply "listened to the singing." In this tax reduction, all issues were first raised for group discussion, and then decisions were made based on the opinions of most groups. This made the work proceed very smoothly, and the masses were very satisfied. In Housun Village in Qinghe, the masses were not enthusiastic at the beginning of the tax reduction. They didn't make a peep during meetings because, during last year's struggle, the cadres took over and left 20 mu of land from the fruits of the struggle for rent instead of distributing it to the masses. The masses murmured behind their backs: "They struggled for the land but didn't distribute it. They rent it out without consulting us. We are still poor. What kind of turning over is this?" Finally, the cadres apologized to the masses and consulted with them on everything, and the work progressed. In Dongmacheng, Feixiang, after the struggle ended and houses were distributed, 23 rooms remained. The masses wanted to handle it themselves, but the village cadres decided on their own to let the primary school, the village office, the militia, and the guesthouse for passing soldiers occupy them. When the masses questioned the cadres, "The primary school has a public temple, why not occupy that? The office has earthen houses, why not occupy those?" The village cadres not only did not accept this but also threatened the masses, but the masses insisted on handling it themselves, and the village cadres' prestige was greatly reduced. In Henan Town, Qixian County, when dealing with the landlord Ma Chunliang, the village cadres decided on their own to punish even Ma Chunliang's uncle (a middle peasant) who had been living separately for a long time. The masses were not satisfied. Many middle peasant members were panicked and dared not go to the meeting, resulting in fewer and fewer farmer members and a great loss to the work. These facts fully prove that overcoming bureaucracy and promoting democracy are the keys to mobilizing the masses.

### 冀南查减经验  群众作主事情好办  干部包办一定碰壁

    冀南查减经验
    群众作主事情好办
    干部包办一定碰壁
    【本报威县十一日电】综合通讯员报导：冀南各地查减运动中，凡是干部发扬民主的村庄，工作就有开展，否则工作就受很大损失。隆平王桥及成家庄的村干部，过去遇着问题都是先由他们讨论，然后将讨论结果通知小组长，由小组再转告群众，群众只是“听唱”。在这次查减中，一切问题都先提给小组讨论，然后综合多数组的意见，作出决定，这样工作进行非常顺利，群众也非常满意。清河后孙庄在开始查减时，群众情绪不高，开会都不哼气，原因是去年斗争时，干部包办，曾将斗争果实二十亩地留下出租，没分给群众，群众背地嘀咕：“斗了地不分，他们租出去，也不和大家商量，咱穷还是穷，翻的啥身呢？”最后干部向群众道了歉，事事和群众商量，工作才开展起来。肥乡东马乘斗争结束，将房屋分配后，仍余二十三间房子，群众的意见愿自己处理，村干却私自作主，让小学、村公所、民兵、过路军人招待所等占去。当群众质问干部“小学有公庙，为啥不占？办公处有土房子为啥不占”？村干不但不接受，并威胁群众，但群众坚持要自己处理，村干威信因此大降。企之县河南町在处理被斗地主马纯良时，村干部包办决定，连马纯良早已分居的叔叔（中农）一齐罚，群众都不满意，很多中农会员恐慌，不敢到会场，以致农会员越来越少，工作受很大损失。这些事实都充分证明了：克服包办，发扬民主，是发动群众的关键。
