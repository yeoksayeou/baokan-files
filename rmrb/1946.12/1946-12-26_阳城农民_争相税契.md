　　Yangcheng Farmers Eagerly Pay Land Deed Tax
    [This Newspaper Taiyue 23rd Dispatch] This is a portrait of the liberated farmers of Yangcheng. Since the initial implementation of "land to the tiller," tens of thousands of poor farmers have obtained land and are eager to pay the land deed tax. In addition, the government has reduced the tax rate from 8% to 4%, and poor military families are given preferential tax exemptions. Therefore, since this month, the county government entrance has been unprecedentedly lively. Groups of liberated farmers, holding their land deeds and full of smiles, enter the tax office, vying to pay the tax. The number of staff at the tax office has increased from one to five, but many people still have to wait two or three days to pay. Liang Tian of Baisang Village said to people, "It's been two days and I still haven't paid." Liu Liqi of Mazhai Village carefully wrapped up his taxed deed and said to the villagers, "This is great." According to staff at the tax office, "People are clamoring to pay the tax early in the morning, and people are still asking to pay the tax late at night. There are six or seven hundred deeds every day."

　　阳城农民  争相税契
    【本报太岳二十三日电】这是阳城翻身农民的一幅翻身图景，自从初步实行耕者有其田，数万贫苦农民获得了土地后，纷纷要求税契，又加政府降低税率，从百分之八减为百分之四，贫苦军属优待免税，所以从本月起，县政府门前空前热闹起来，成群结队的翻身农民拿着田契满面笑容的走进税契处，抢着叫着税契，税契处的工作人员由一个增至五个，但许多人仍是等了二天或三天尚未税。白桑村梁天向人说：“已经两天还没税上。”马寨村的刘立启，把税了的约契谨慎的包扎起来，对村的人说：“这可好了。”据税契处工作人员谈：“大清早就有人在叫着税契，深夜还有人要求税契，每天都有六七百张。”
