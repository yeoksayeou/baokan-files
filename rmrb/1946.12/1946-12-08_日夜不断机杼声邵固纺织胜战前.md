　　【This newspaper's dispatch from Weixian, 6th】 Through land reform and government support, Weixian's textile industry is experiencing unprecedented prosperity. The textile industry around Shaogu has long been renowned, with farmers in eighteen or nineteen villages universally skilled in spinning and weaving, capable of weaving various patterned cloths. Around the 1930s, Shaogu had seventeen local cloth shops, with each market day seeing transactions of 10,000 bolts of local cloth and 10,000 jin of local thread. Subsequently, with the increasing influx of foreign cloth, Qin Xiaoqing, a large landlord in Shaogu, invested heavily in selling foreign cloth, thus seizing the local cloth market and completely bankrupting the textile industry. Farmer Zheng Ziting said, "At that time, foreign cloth was both cheap and good, making it impossible for us to compete. Landlord Qin Xiaoqing made so much money it piled up like a mountain." Under his usurious exploitation, the broad masses fell into hunger and death. After the Incident, under the ravages and plunder of the Japanese invaders, the local textile industry became even more desolate. Last year, after the Eighth Route Army liberated Weixian, the democratic government immediately organized shops and exchanges to prevent profiteers from disrupting the market, uniformly sold goods externally, and provided loans of 600,000 yuan to actively help recovery. After the land reform movement of the past two years, farmers have obtained land and capital, and the textile industry has rapidly developed, now surpassing its former scale. The villages in this area currently have over 3,000 towel weaving machines and looms (compared to just over 1,000 before the Incident), capable of producing over 4,000 dozen towels and over 400 bolts of patterned cloth daily. Due to the significant profits gained from textiles, villages such as Dingzhai and Guandi have eliminated extreme poverty, and land prices have risen to 50,000 yuan per mu, greatly improving farmers' lives. Shaogu farmer Zhao Rulian said, "When the Kuomintang was in power, my father starved to death; after the Communist Party came, I got ten mu of land, and also have children." Old woman Chen said, "I relied on the Communist Party to help me with 1,000 yuan, spinning thread day and night, spinning seven jin of thread a day, earning 500 yuan. I have already accumulated 10,000 yuan, and plan to buy a loom with three old mothers, so we can live a good life in the future." To respond to the call for winter production, under the slogan of "every family spinning and weaving" and "the sound of looms never ceasing day and night," even more farmers are engaged in textiles. Villages around Shaogu have been adding nearly 300 new looms each month recently.
　　【This newspaper's dispatch from Taiyue, 3rd】 Yangfeng Village in Qinyuan's sixth district organized forty-six women to engage in textiles this year. From March until now, each person has been lent two and a half jin of cotton, turning it over three times, solving this year's clothing problem. Out of the village's forty-two households, thirty-three do not need to buy a foot of cloth, and have new coats and new pants to wear. The Li Yueying group, comprising seven families with thirty-three people, has each worn an average of five zhang and three chi of new cloth. The village's total textile income this year is equivalent to forty-eight shi of rice. They achieved such results because of a clear division of labor, with leadership mobilizing the entire group to compete, raising everyone's enthusiasm. After the women's rescue association helped them summarize their experiences, they are planning to conduct winter textiles.

　　日夜不断机杼声邵固纺织胜战前
    【本报威县六日电】经过土地改革及政府扶植，威县纺织业空前繁荣。邵固一带十八九个村庄的纺织业久负盛名，农民普遍会纺会织，能织各种花布。民国二十年前后，邵固曾有土布店十七家，每集能成交土布万匹及土线万斤。嗣后外来洋布日多，邵固大地主秦枭卿投资大批贩卖洋布，土布市场乃被侵夺，纺织完全破产。农民郑自停说：“那时洋布又贱又好，弄的俺就没有法。地主秦枭卿赚的银钱堆成山”。在他高利贷剥削下，广大群众陷于饥饿和死亡。事变后在日寇摧残掠夺下，该地纺织业更加萧条。去年八路军解放威县后，民主政府即组织商店及交易所，防止奸商扰乱，统一向外销售，并贷款六十万元，积极帮助恢复。该地纺织业经过去今两年的土地改革运动，农民获得土地和资本，纺织业即迅速发达，现已超过往日的规模。这一带村庄目前有毛巾机及织布机三千余架（事变前只有一千余架），每天可产毛巾四千余打，花布四百余匹。因纺织获得大利，丁寨、官地等村，已消灭了赤贫，地价已涨至五万元一亩，农民生活大大改善。邵固农民赵如连说：“国民党在时，俺爹饿死；共产党来了，俺要了十亩地，还有了儿女”。陈老婆说：“俺靠共产党帮助了一千元，白天黑夜络线子，一天络七斤线，赚五百元，俺已积了一万元，和三个老妈妈打算买张机子，往后过好日子啊”。为响应冬季生产的号召，近在“家家纺织”，“日夜不断机声”的口号下，已有更多的农民纺织，邵固一带村庄，近来每月能添新机子三百余架。
    【本报太岳三日电】沁源六区阳凤村今年组织了四十六个妇女进行纺织，从三月到现在，每人贷花二斤半，翻了三个滚，解决了今年的穿衣问题。全村四十二户人家，有三十三户不用买一尺布，有了新袄新裤穿。李月英组共七家三十三口人，每人平均穿了五丈三尺新布，全村今年纺织收入合计四十八石米。她们得到这样成绩是因为分工明确，领导全体发动竞赛，提起了大家的积极性。妇救会帮助他们作了总结后，正计划进行冬季纺织。
