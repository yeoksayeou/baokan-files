　　[This Newspaper Report] The Jincheng militia are developing a thunder mine construction campaign along the mountain passes to protect their homeland. After Chiang's puppet troops invaded Qinyang, they frequently harassed us. The Jincheng militia rose up and organized home-defense rotational warfare teams, building a strong defense line along the border passes. In addition to being responsible for the defense south of the county, the 9th District militia also took the initiative to send small units to the Qinyang area to strike the enemy. Militias in various places are now actively leading the emancipated masses to carry out a mine-making and war-preparation campaign. The First District has recently completed more than 70,000 stone mines. In order to improve blasting techniques, the 6th and 7th districts have universally carried out training sessions. "Those in the old areas who know how to blast go to the new areas as instructors, and the new areas ask the old areas for masters." The county has now trained more than 1,300 new explosives experts, and there are mine areas, mine nets, minefields, and street mines everywhere. The sound of blasting drills can be heard everywhere. The entire armed emancipated masses are in high spirits. They say: "Come on, you damned little Chiang, we'll make sure you can't get out once you come in." (Bo)
　　[This Newspaper Report] In order to solve the problem of "Why isn't the explosion campaign developing quickly?", the Taiyue Shimin County recently convened district and village cadres from the 5th and 6th districts to discuss the importance of the explosion campaign. At the meeting, the current situation was first discussed. Everyone agreed that although we are almost at the top of the mountain, we still cannot do without thinking of new ways to further our campaign to annihilate the enemy. Secondly, they examined the phenomenon of underestimating stone mines, such as saying "Eating rice is better than eating noodles, a stone mine is not as good as a machine gun," which are all hindering the development of the explosion campaign. Explosion King Zhang Jinde said: "It's not that stone mines are useless, but a matter of improving technology." Zhang Xuewen, director of Dongda Village, said: "We cannot underestimate stone mines. Their power is quite powerful. We should study how to use them. We are preparing this time. If the enemy really attacks here, we will first lay mines everywhere at the large and small intersections, hide a 'White Tiger Lying in Wait' on the main gate, put a few 'Watchdogs' on the small gate, and then hide a few 'Black Watermelons' (all names of stone mines) in the house, so that the enemy can have a good taste of this kind of flavor. Since this meeting, the idea of underestimating stone mines has been overcome, and the entire county is launching a mine-making campaign. In just a few days, the 5th and 6th districts have completed 2,500 large and small stone mines.

　　晋城民兵大力开展造雷运动
    培养爆炸能手一千三
    士敏干部座谈爆炸作用纠正轻视石雷思想
    【本报讯】晋城民兵沿山口建筑工事开展造雷运动，保卫家乡。蒋伪侵陷我沁阳后，经常出扰，晋城民兵奋起组织了保家轮战队，沿边防山口筑起一道坚强的防线。九区民兵除担任县以南的防务外，并主动派小部队到沁阳一带打击敌人。各地民兵现正积极领导翻身群众开展造雷备战运动。一区近已完成石雷七万余个。为了提高爆炸技术，六、七等区并普遍的进行集训，“老区会爆炸的到新区去当教员，新区到老区请师傅”。全县现已培养出一千三百多个新的爆炸能手，各地都有雷区、雷网、雷阵、铺街等布置，演习爆炸的声响，处处可闻。全体武装起来的翻身群众情绪极高，他们说：“狗日的小老蒋来吧，管叫他进来出不去。”（波）
    【本报讯】太岳士敏县为解决“爆炸运动为什么开展得不快”问题，特于日前召集五、六两区区村干部；座谈爆炸运动的重要性。会上首先讨论目前形势，大家一致认为虽然快上山顶，如果不想办法更进一步的开展歼敌运动还是不行的。其次，检讨了轻视石雷现象，例如说“吃米不如吃面，石雷不如机枪”等，都是防碍爆炸运动的开展的。爆炸大王张锦德说：“不是石雷不顶事，而是提高技术问题。”东大村主任张学温说：“我们不能轻视石雷，它的威力是相当利害的，应该研究怎么应用它。我们这次准备着，敌人要真进攻这里，先在大小路口到处埋雷，大门上藏个“白虎当道卧”，小门上喂几个“看门狗”，家里再藏几个“黑西瓜”（都是石雷名子），管叫敌人好好尝尝这种滋味。自这次会议后，克服了轻视石雷的思想，全县正展开造雷运动。仅五、六两区数天内已完成两千五百个大小石雷。
