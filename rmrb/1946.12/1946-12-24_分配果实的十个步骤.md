　　Ten Steps for Distributing Fruits
　　Unified Adjustment of Land
　　Taixi's Experience in Distributing Fruits
　　Tang Ximin
　　Based on the experience of various places in Taixi, the distribution of the fruits of struggle generally involves the following ten steps. The purpose of these ten steps is to achieve full democracy and fair and reasonable distribution of fruits as much as possible.
　　The first step is to establish a struggle fruit distribution committee through democratic elections by everyone, absorbing activists in the liquidation struggle to participate.
　　The second step is to post a list of struggle fruits, noting the reasons for the struggle. This is done to ensure economic transparency and prevent fraud; on the other hand, it also explains that these things recovered from the landlords are completely justified. In addition, it can also check whether the correct policy was grasped during the liquidation. For the land recovered from the liquidation, the size of the land, the quality of the soil, and the names of the location, landlord, and tenant should be noted.
　　The third step is to conduct in-depth investigations of the population and land, and to assess the grades for distributing the fruits. Based on the size of their population and the quality of the land, assess who can get good land and who can get more, so as to distribute it fairly and reasonably. If necessary, a population and land list can also be issued.
　　The fourth step is to convene a cadre meeting to open up the cadres' minds and require them to handle matters fairly and without bias.
　　The fifth step is to open up the minds of the masses, turning the proposition of "land to the tiller" and "filling the gaps" into the thinking of the masses. Let everyone discuss the method of distributing the fruits.
　　The above two steps are the most central link in the entire process of distributing the fruits, and are also the key to determining the success or failure of the work. If these two steps are done well, generally speaking, the fruits can be distributed fairly and reasonably.
　　The sixth step, after the above conditions are ripe, is to convene the struggle fruit distribution committee to discuss specific methods and conduct detailed research on each household.
　　The seventh step is to issue a draft fruit distribution list by village, detailing the number of people in each household, the number of original land plots, the number obtained this time, and the names of the original landlord and tenant of the distributed land, and where it is located.
　　The eighth step is to mobilize various mass organizations to convene group meetings, member meetings, and it is best to convene family meetings by household to study the draft fruit distribution list, compare with each other, and propose revisions and supplementary opinions.
　　The ninth step is to convene a general meeting to gather all the opinions, discuss them together, and make the final revisions; then, pass it at the meeting and issue the formal list.
　　The tenth step is to write new contracts, completely in accordance with rural customs, detailing the land price, boundaries, intermediaries, etc. Old-fashioned receipts must be handled in accordance with regulations, and must not be done hastily. After writing them, affix signatures in person, destroy the old contracts, and go to the fields for on-site inspections and insert boundary markers to avoid disputes afterwards.
　　After all the above procedures are completed, the fruits are considered to be distributed. The peasants who get the land will definitely be overjoyed. According to the old custom, buying land requires eating "round contract wine". If the masses have such a request, the whole village can slaughter pigs and make wine, and everyone can have a good drink. This opportunity should be seized to convene a liberation celebration meeting to further enhance everyone's understanding of the source of the struggle fruits, call on the peasants to unite more closely, work hard in production, support the front line, and always follow the Communist Party.
　　The scope of land distribution is based on the village as the basic unit, but it must be uniformly adjusted by the district as the unit. The district must have a detailed and thorough plan for this, otherwise it will make rich villages richer and poor villages poorer. For example, in Li Jia Zhuang in the Sixth District, all the poor peasants in the village have risen to the level of middle peasants after the land reform; however, Cao Village, which is one mile away from the village, has not even eliminated all the extremely poor. This can be completely avoided as long as we pay attention to it at the beginning.
　　Which lands belong to the scope of unified adjustment by the district? The first category is the land of big landlords, the second category is the land of landlords from other districts, the third category is public land, school land, temple land, as well as the land of traitors that the government has confiscated and the land of fugitive landlords that is being managed.
　　The first category of land, because the scope of oppression and exploitation by big landlords will never be limited to one or two villages, therefore, a joint struggle should be launched in this area of villages, and the liquidated land should be uniformly distributed according to the size and poverty of the participating villages. In order to facilitate leadership and land distribution, it is best to divide this area of villages into a small district, and use the village where the big landlord lives as the key village of the small district.
　　The vast majority of the second category of land already belongs to the government. If some villages have already adjusted part of the land from the first category, but still cannot fill the gaps, they can appropriately adjust a part from this category of land again. Some villages neither have much land to distribute in their own village, nor have they participated in joint struggles, and should be given more and better land from this type of land.
　　After the adjustment of the first and second categories of land, if the difference in wealth and poverty between some villages is still very large, the leadership needs to mobilize the rich villages, under the slogan of "the poor help the poor" and "everyone liberate themselves together," to give up part of the liquidated land and give it to the poor masses in neighboring villages. But this must be truly voluntary.
　　The district must uniformly adjust all these three categories of land. According to the amount of land originally owned by each village, how many extremely poor peasants there are, and how much land was liquidated separately in the village, the district will determine the amount to be filled and use these three categories of land to adjust separately. When adjusting the second category of land, it is best to allocate them land in their own village or nearby. If not, then mobilize the masses to exchange with each other after the land is allocated, and exchange the land to be near their own village.

　　分配果实的十个步骤
    统一调剂土地
    泰西分果实经验
    唐西民
    根据泰西各地的经验，分配斗争果实，一般有如下的十个步骤。这十个步骤的目的，是要尽量作到完全发扬民主，与公平合理分配果实。
    第一步，经过大家民主选举，成立斗争果实分配委员会，吸收清算斗争中的积极分子参加。
    第二步，张贴斗争果实清单，并注明斗出的理由。这样作，一方面经济公开，可以防止舞弊；另方面也说明了从地主清算回来这些东西，是完全有情有理的。另外，还可以检查清算中是否正确掌握了政策。对于清算回来的土地，并应注明地亩的大小，土质的好坏，以及座落、地主和佃户的姓名。
    第三步，深入调查人口、地亩、评定分配果实等级。根据他们人口的多少，地亩的大小好坏，评定那些人可得好田，那些人可以多分些，以便公平合理分配。必要时，也可以出人口地亩榜。
    第四步，召开干部会，打通干部思想，要求他们公平处理，不偏私徇情。
    第五步，打通群众思想，把耕者有其田、填平补齐的主张，变成群众的思想。让大家来讨论分配果实办法。
    以上两个步骤，是分配果实全部过程中最中心的一环，也是决定工作成败的关键。如果这两个步骤做得好，一般的说，果实大体上就可以分得公平合理了。
    第六步，在以上条件成熟后，就召开斗争果实分配委员会，讨论具体方法，按户精细研究。
    第七步，以村为单位出果实分配草榜，每户的人数，原有地亩数，这次所得数，以及分到的土地的原地主、原佃户姓名，座落何地，均需详细注明。
    第八步，发动各群众团体召集小组会，会员大会，最好能以户为单位召开家庭会，来研究果实分配草榜，互相比较，提出修正和补充意见。
    第九步，召开全体大会，把所有的意见集中起来，经过大家的讨论，进行最后的修改；然后，在大会通过，即出正式榜。
    第十步，写新契，完全仍照农村的习俗，详细写明地价，四至，中人……等。旧式票据要一律照办，切勿草率从事。写好后当面画字，毁老契，并到地里去实地勘察，插好界标，以免过后发生纠葛。
    以上的一切手续办完后，果实才算是分好了。农民得到了土地，一定欢天喜地，按照旧习惯，买地是要吃“圆契酒”的，如果群众都有这样的要求，可以全村杀猪打酒，大家痛饮一场。并应抓紧这个机会，召开一个翻身庆祝大会，使大家更进一步认识斗争果实的来源，号召农民更加团结，努力生产，支援前线，永远跟着共产党走。
    分配土地的范围，以村为单位是基本的，但又必须以区为单位来统一调剂。对此，区里要有详细周密的计划，否则，会使肥村更肥，瘦村仍瘦。如六区李家庄在土地改革后，全村贫农都上升成中农了；可是离该村一里地的曹村，连赤贫尚未全部消灭。这只要我们在开始时加以注意，是完全可以避免的。
    那些地属于区统一调剂的范围呢？第一类是大地主的土地，第二类是外区地主的寄庄地，第三类是公田、学田、庙地，以及政府已经没收了的汉奸的土地和逃亡地主的代管地。
    第一类土地，因为大地主压迫和剥削的范围绝不会限于一两个村子，因此，应当发动这一片村庄进行联合大斗争，清算的土地，按照参加斗争村庄的大小贫富，统一分配。为了便于领导和分配土地，最好能把这一片村子划为一个小区，并以大地主所住的村子作为小区的重点村。
    第二类土地，绝大部份已归政府所有，如有些村庄已经由第一类土地内调剂了一部分，依然不能填平，就可以从这一类土地里面再适当的调剂给一部分。有些村庄本村既无多少土地可分，又没有参加联合斗争，更应从此类土地中多给他们调剂一些较好的土地。
    经过第一、二两类土地调剂以后，如有些村庄之间肥瘦县殊依然很大，领导上就需要动员富村，在“穷帮穷”“大家一齐翻身”的口号下，让出一部分清算回来的土地，送给邻近的穷村群众。但这一定要真正做到自动自愿。
    所有这三类调剂土地，区里必须统一调剂。根据各村原有土地多少？赤贫农共有多少？本村单独清算回来多少土地？决定填补数目，用这三类土地分别调剂。在调剂第二类土地时，最好能拨给他们本村或临近的地。如不能，则在拨地以后动员群众来互相调换，把地调换到本村附近来。
