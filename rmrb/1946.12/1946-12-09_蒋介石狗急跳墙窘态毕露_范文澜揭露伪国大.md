　　Chiang Kai-shek Desperate and Cornered, Showing Utter Embarrassment
　　Fan Wenlan Exposes the Pseudo-National Assembly
[This dispatch from our Changzhi correspondent, dated the 5th] North China University President Fan Wenlan, at the "Emergency Mobilization Meeting Against Chiang Kai-shek's Betrayal of the Motherland," strongly condemned Chiang Kai-shek for signing the "Sino-American Treaty of Commerce and Navigation," convening the fake "National Assembly," and attacking Yan'an. The meeting was jointly held by North China University and the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles on November 26th. Fan stated that Chiang Kai-shek's tricks were a "desperate dog jumping over the wall" farce. He said: "After the victory of the anti-fascist war, the Chinese people unanimously demanded 'independence, peace, and democracy.' Chiang Kai-shek would not allow it and opened fire on the people. But the more he fought, the more helpless he became, so he exchanged China's entire sovereignty for the military assistance of American imperialism, continuing to expand the Chinese civil war in an attempt to turn China into a colony of the United States, so that he himself could be an emperor-son of America." The recently signed Sino-American Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is the general manifestation of this purpose. Even the Ta Kung Pao said: "This treaty will dominate China's semi-colonial fate for a hundred years." Why did Chiang Kai-shek want to convene a fake National Assembly? Fan said: "Chiang Kai-shek's National Government is an illegitimate child. In the past, it could still deceive the people, but now the people's eyes are bright, so he came up with a fake National Assembly to have it acknowledge the 'legality' of his illegitimate government. In reality, it is still an illegitimate child." Principal Fan quoted the historical fact that Yuan Shikai wanted to sit on the throne and maintain his dictatorship by formulating a "constitution," warning Chiang Kai-shek about the politics of "a desperate dog jumping over the wall," saying: "Didn't Yuan Shikai also hold a 'National Assembly'? But he soon collapsed. An illegitimate child is ultimately an illegitimate child; you can't change it." Regarding the attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, Fan said: "The more Chiang Kai-shek fights, the more he is defeated. He really has no other way, so he is attacking Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and attacking Yan'an to show his 'strength.' In reality, this is just a 'desperate dog jumping over the wall' farce." He alerted everyone: "Don't think that a desperate dog jumping over the wall means there's no other way. A dog can still bite people; we must always be on guard. If the dog comes to bite, we will fight." He also called on everyone to "resolutely follow the Communist Party" and "resolutely follow Chairman Mao." Finally, all faculty and students of North China University and all workers of the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles jointly sent a telegram to all circles of the country: demanding the immediate dissolution of the fake National Assembly convened by Chiang Kai-shek and refusing to recognize the treasonous Sino-American Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. They also sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, vowing to be the backing for defending the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and vowing to fight to the end to defend Chairman Mao!

　　蒋介石狗急跳墙窘态毕露
    范文澜揭露伪国大
    【本报长治五日电】北大校长范文澜氏在“反对蒋介石出卖祖国紧急动员大会”上，痛斥蒋介石签订“中美通商航海条约”、召开伪“国大”及进攻延安，该会是北大及边区文联在十一月二十六日联合召开的。范氏称：蒋介石这些把戏是“狗急跳墙”的丑剧。他说：“反法西斯战争胜利后。中国人民一致要求‘独立、和平、民主’，蒋介石不允许，便向人民开火，可是他越打越没有办法，便以出卖中国的全部主权来换取美帝国主义的军事援助，继续扩大中国内战，企图把中国变为美国的殖民地，他自己好做美国的儿皇帝。”最近签订的中美通商航海条约，就是这个目的总的表现。连大公报也说：“这个条约将支配中国一百年的半殖民地命运。”为什么蒋介石要召开伪国民大会呢？范氏说：“蒋介石国民政府是个私生子，过去还能欺骗人民，现在人民眼睛亮了，他便来了个伪国民大会，叫承认他私生子政府的‘合法’，实际上这还是个私生子。”范校长引用袁世凯想坐皇帝维护独裁制定“宪法”的历史事实，警告蒋介石“狗急跳墙”的政治说：“袁世凯不是也曾开过‘国民大会’吗？但他不久就垮台了。私生子终究是私生子，变也变不过”。关于进攻陕甘宁边区，范氏说：“蒋介石越打越败，实在没有办法了，所以就来进攻陕甘宁、进攻延安，来表示他的‘力量’。实际上这也只是‘狗急跳墙’的丑剧。”他警惕大家：“不要以为狗急跳墙就是什么办法也没有了，狗还会咬人，我们还要时刻防备，狗来咬，我们就打。”并号召大家“坚决跟着共产党走”、“坚决跟着毛主席走”。最后，北方大学全体教职学员及边区文联全体工作者联名致电全国各界：要求立即解散蒋介石包办召开的伪国民大会，不承认中美通商航海的卖国条约。并致电毛主席、朱总司令，誓为保卫陕甘宁边区后盾，誓为保卫毛主席而奋斗到底！
