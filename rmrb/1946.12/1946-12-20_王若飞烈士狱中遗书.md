This is a letter from Comrade Wang Ruofei to his cousin-in-law, Xiong Mingqing, written while he was imprisoned in Suiyuan. This letter, along with three others, was mimeographed by Mr. Huang Qisheng and recently discovered. It was published in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily on September 23rd. Here, only one is recorded to show the martyr's integrity.

Ming brother: The end of the year is the easiest time to stir up feelings. Moreover, my current situation makes me feel a hundred kinds of worries. I think of the urgency of the national crisis and hate the delay of my own demise. I have lofty aspirations, but no way to fly. I toss and turn at the fifth watch and can only sigh in vain! Although prisoners of Chu cry to each other, only the weak do so. As for us, we can only persevere and wait. I have long disregarded my personal life. Having been in prison for a long time, my energy has gradually declined, and my skin is puffy. If I accidentally scratch myself, it often leads to ulceration. This is because I have not seen sunlight for many years, and I am also exposed to dampness and dirt. It is like the trees of Phoebe zhennan and Cinnamomum camphora, placed in a toilet in a low and wet place, which will also rot and peel. Moreover, the winter is cold and the days are short, and the clouds are often not open. In addition, the room is blocked by high walls, which makes it even darker. All day long, I am as if in a dim curtain, unable to distinguish the faces of my fellow inmates. The human hell is indeed not an exaggeration. Some people say that the life of a miner is being buried without dying; the life in a big prison is dying without being buried. Since the beginning of winter, I have been sleeping for fourteen hours a day (prison rules: one must go to bed at six in the evening and not sit up until dawn the next morning). It is really like a long sleep. When we first entered the prison, we saw that the old inmates showed no sorrow for the dead prisoners, but said, "The lawsuit is well fought." We were deeply surprised by their ruthlessness, but later we learned that they all thought it was better to die quickly than to suffer slowly while alive. Every month on the 7th and 1st, prisoners are allowed to be visited by relatives and friends. The inmates jokingly call this reception day "sweeping the grave" or "burning paper." About one-third of the prisoners have someone to "burn paper" for them every month. These people receive financial assistance from their relatives and friends, and their lives are naturally better than those who have no one to "sweep the grave" or "burn paper" for them. Generally, those who have no one to "sweep the grave" for them can only look forward to the three times a year when the prison gives steamed buns (usually they eat millet, but they get a meal of steamed buns on New Year's Day, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival). Therefore, falling ill is the most painful thing. The ward opposite my room, a few feet away, is for the sick. I often hear cries of pain in the morning and evening. I do not mourn their death, but I am saddened by their illness. Although I often give them material assistance, the amount I can share is not much.
    The above is a trivial description of the life in a large prison. After reading it, my brother may think that I am in this environment, and how sad and painful I will be. In fact, it is not the case. I only have a heart of worry for the times. As long as there is a breath, I will continue to work hard and struggle. The suffering I am currently experiencing was expected long ago and is unavoidable in the work process. It is not worth any pain. Therefore, my spirit is very healthy, and I will never imitate Jia Yi's weeping and sighing. I only persevere in maintaining this healthy spirit. If there is a chance to allow me to work for society in the future, it would be very fortunate. Otherwise, I should seek to die in prison in relatively good health. I have no pessimism or depression at all. There are still five people in my ward. Their lawsuits are all for more than ten years. They often sigh and lament that they cannot hope to be released from prison alive. I try my best to comfort them, guide them to have hope, guide them to learn to read and write, and guide them to have fun (playing chess and singing). On the one hand, I give them a sense of life, and on the other hand, I make my daily life not empty. When they curse this prison life, I often jokingly say, "We are the happiest people in the world. We do nothing every day, and we don't worry about anything. When the time comes, someone will invite us to sleep, and we sleep for fourteen hours. In the morning, someone will invite us to get up. The food is ready and they invite us to eat. There is even someone to follow us to the toilet, and the fire kang is burned in winter. Isn't it comfortable enough?" At the same time, I also describe the misery of the refugees in areas affected by natural disasters or wars, and the life of the soldiers in the icy and snowy battlefield. Compared to them, we are already very comfortable. Of course, everyone would rather fight to the death on the battlefield than enjoy the comfort of a large prison. I say this to make fun, and also to show that there are other pains in the world, and you can't just see yourself. Even my brother's current life must have many difficulties, but the content and nature of the difficulties are completely different from mine. My difference from ordinary people in adversity is that I am very optimistic about the future. This optimism is not shaken by personal life and death, or partial failures, or temporary setbacks. What I find most difficult at the moment is my idleness and the visible weakening of my body. I regret that I cannot die on the battlefield. Every day when it is about to dawn, I hear the bugle call of the military camp on the pillow, and I can't help but feel excited. Alas, will I ever have the day to ride a horse on the battlefield again?..."

### 王若飞烈士狱中遗书

　　王若飞烈士狱中遗书
    这是王若飞同志在绥远狱中时致表姊婿熊铭青的信，此信与他信三封，曾由黄齐生先生油印成册，不久以前才发现的，重庆新华日报九月二三日发表。这里仅录其一，以见烈士气节。
    “铭兄：岁尾年头，最易动人怀抱，况我今日处境更觉百感烦心，念国难之日亟，恨亡身之蹉蛇；冲天有志，奋飞无术，五更转侧，徒唤奈何！虽然楚囚对泣，惟弱者而后如此，至于我辈只有坚忍以侯。个人生命，早置度外。居狱中久，气血渐衰，皮肉虚浮，偶而擦破，常致溃烂，盖缘长年不见日光，又日为阴湿秽浊所薰染，譬之楠梓豫章之木，置之厕所卑湿之地，亦将腐朽剥蚀也。又冬冷天短，云常不开，又兼住房为高墙所障，愈显阴黑，终日若在昏幕中，莫能细辨同号者面貌，人间地狱，信非虚语。有人谓矿工生活是埋了没有死；大狱生活是死了没有埋。交冬以来，吾日睡十四小时（狱规：晚六时即须就寝，直至翌晨天已大明方准坐起）真无殊长眠，当吾人初入狱时，见一般老难友对于囚之死者，毫无戚容，反谓“官司打好了”，深诧其无情，后乃知彼等心理皆以为与其活着慢漫受罪，反不如一死爽快也。每月逢七一日，允许囚人亲友来监探视，难友皆戏称此接见日为“上坟”，“烧纸”，狱囚每月有人来“烧纸”者约三分之一，此辈获亲友银钱之接济，生活自较完全无人“上坟”“烧纸”者为好。一般完全无人“上坟”者，只有盼望狱中每年例给之三次馒头（平日均食小米，惟元旦、端午、中秋，给一餐馒头）。因而患病，是最苦事，吾所居号对面，相距数尺，即为病号，早晚时闻呼惨痛之声，吾于彼等，不哀其死，而伤其病。虽常给以物质帮助，然鬼而为鬼烧纸，所能分惠亦不多也。
    以上琐琐叙述大狱生活，吾兄阅后，或将以为弟居此环境中，将如何哀痛伤苦，其实不然，弟只有忧时之心，一息尚存，当终努力奋斗。现时所受之苦难，早在预计之中，为工作过程所难免，绝不值什么伤痛也。因此弟之精神甚为健康，绝不效贾长沙之痛哭流涕长太息，惟坚忍保持此健康之精神。如将来能有容我为社会工作之机会，固属万幸，否则亦当求在狱能比较健康而死，弟并无丝毫悲观颓丧之念也。与吾同号者，尚有五人，彼等官司皆在十年以上，时常咨嗟叹息，以为难望生出狱门，我尽力慰解彼等，导之有希望，导之识字读书，导之行乐开心（下棋唱歌），一面给彼等以生趣，一面使我每日的生活亦不空虚。当彼等咀咒此大狱生活时，我常滑稽的取笑说：“我们是世间上最幸福的人，每天一点事不做。一点心不操，到时候有人来请睡，一睡就是十四点钟，早上有人来请起，饭做好了就请我们吃，上厕所还有人跟随，冬天又烧火炕，难道还不够舒服么？”同时又叙述遭受天灾或兵灾区域难民的悲苦，冰天雪地中沙场战士的生活，我们与之相较，实已很舒服。自然任何人都愿在沙场奋战而死，不愿享受大狱的舒服。吾为此言，一面取笑，一面亦示人世间尚有其他痛苦存在，不可只看到自己也。即如吾兄现时之生活，想来亦必有许多难处，不过困难内容性质，与弟完全不同耳。弟处逆境与普通人不同处，即对于将来前途，非常乐观，这种乐观，并不因个人的生死、或部分的失败、一时的顿挫，而有所动摇，弟现时所最难堪者，为闲与身体之日见衰弱，恨不能死于战场耳。每日天将明时，枕上闻军营号声，不禁神魂飞越。嗟乎吾岂有重跃马于疆场之日乎？……”
