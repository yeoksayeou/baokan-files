Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. TASS Shanghai, 1st: The Shanghai Workers' Union has issued a declaration demanding the dissolution of the one-party "National Assembly." The declaration states: "According to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), the National Assembly should be convened by a coalition government composed of representatives from various political parties. Now, the Kuomintang government, in violation of the solemn resolutions of the PCC, has convened a one-party National Assembly, leading to national division. This National Assembly has no democratic flavor whatsoever; it is merely the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang. As a result of the civil war, the corruption of the Kuomintang's administration, and the decline of industry, the Chinese people, especially us workers, have suffered profound pain. The 'Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation,' signed by the Kuomintang government, has surrendered navigation and tariff rights to foreign countries. The flooding of the Chinese market with American goods has directly resulted in factory closures and worker unemployment." The declaration continues, "Kuomintang police officers arbitrarily abuse, coerce, and arrest workers in factories. Convening a one-party National Assembly is a new attack by the Kuomintang on the human rights of workers. In the list of 'National Assembly representatives,' we see some who seem to be representing Shanghai workers, but we Shanghai workers have never elected any such representatives." The declaration concludes, "We call on workers across the country to boycott this National Assembly. We demand the dissolution of this National Assembly and the preparation for a new National Assembly in accordance with the resolutions of the PCC."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. Moscow, 2nd broadcast, Soviet commentator Markov, in his commentary "New Conspiracy of the Chinese Reactionaries," said: "Over the past year, the Kuomintang reactionaries have completely erased the Chinese people's demands for the establishment of democracy. Not a single important resolution of the Political Consultative Conference has been implemented. The civil war has not only not stopped but has reached an unprecedented scale. The Kuomintang has unilaterally convened the National Assembly, with the participating representatives including many traitors from the anti-Japanese period, while not a single democratic element is participating. However, at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly, Chiang Kai-shek described the National Assembly as not only a conference to pass a constitution but also a 'democratic and progressive conference.' The National Assembly, boycotted by various democratic parties in China, will pass a completely undemocratic constitution." The commentator concluded, "The Kuomintang's convening of the National Assembly under the conditions of intensifying the civil war with the economic and military assistance of the United States foreshadows new conspiracies by the Chinese reactionaries."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. According to Associated Press, Moscow: Pravda, on the 2nd, published for the first time a Soviet official editorial on the National Assembly, pointing out that the Kuomintang unilaterally cannot solve China's internal affairs problems.

　　上海工人联合会发表宣言
  　要求解散一党“国大”
  　真理报评一党国大不能解决中国问题
    【新华社延安三日电】据塔斯社上海一日电：上海工人联合会发表宣言，要求解散一党的“国民大会”。宣言称：“按照政协决议，国大应由各政党代表组成之联合政府召集。现在国民党政府违反政协庄严的定决，召集一党的国大，致造成全国分裂。这个国大毫无民主气味，只是国民党的一党专政而已。由于内战，国民党的行政腐败及工业衰落的结果，中国人民特别是我们工人遭受到深刻的痛苦。国民党政府所订签的‘中美友好通商航海条约’、将航权与关税权断送给外国，美货充斥中国市场，其直接结果为工厂倒闭与工人失业。”宣言继指出：“国民党警察司以随便到工厂内虐待强迫与逮捕工人，召集一党国大是国民党对工人人权所举行的新进攻。在‘国大代表’名单中，我们看到一些似乎是代表上海工人的‘国大代表’，但我们上海工人从来也未选过什么代表。”该宣言在结语中称：“我们号召全国工人抵制这个国大，我们要求解散这个国大，按照政协决议进行筹备新的国大。”
    【新华社延安三日电】莫斯科二日广播，苏评论员马克可夫论“中国反动派的新策动”说：“今年一年以来，国民党反动派已将中国人民建立民主的要求一笔勾消，政协会议的重要决议没有一条被实行，内战不仅未停止，且达到了空前的规模，国民党却单方面召开国大，参加的代表包括不少抗日时期的卖国贼，民主分子却没任何一人参加。可是在国大开会典礼上，蒋介石却把国大说成不仅是通过宪法的大会，而且是什么‘民主的进步的大会’。中国各民主政党所抵制的国大，将通过一个完全非民主的宪法。”评论员结语称：“国民党在获得美国经济军事援助而加紧内战的条件下召开国大，预示中国反动派将有新的策动。”
    【新华社延安三日电】据美联社莫斯科电：真理报二日首次发表苏官方对国大的社评，指出国民党单方面不能解决中国的内政问题。
