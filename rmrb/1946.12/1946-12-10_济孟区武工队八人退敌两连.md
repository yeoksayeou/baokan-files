　　On the 12th of last month, at dawn, the enemy entrenched on the border of Ji Meng, under the cover of superior firepower, launched a fierce attack on our positions around Youfangtou and Leishanling. Our Staff Officer He and Deputy Instructor Qiao led the guerrilla unit and district cadres to attack the enemy from the flank of Zhangwa. The enemy's attempt failed. At about 9 o'clock, they divided into two companies and attacked our Zhangwa. Staff Officer He and Deputy Political Instructor Qiao led six soldiers from the guerrilla unit and district cadres to launch an attack on the enemy amidst intense enemy artillery fire, scattering the two enemy companies. The enemy retreated through Yaozhuang towards Gangouqiao. An officer-like figure rode away on a bicycle to escape. Staff Officer He hit the officer with a grenade. The officer cried "Mother!" and fell to the ground with the bicycle. The enemy organized three charges, but were all suppressed by our grenades. We took advantage of the victory to pursue. As we approached Xizhai near Gangouqiao, an enemy machine gun on the opposite side fired frantically. The shooter's thin face was topped with a peaked cap, and he was frantically pressing the cartridge. Staff Officer He took out his last grenade and rushed forward. With a "boom", both the man and the gun rolled down. The enemy completely collapsed and retreated. We suffered no casualties and returned to our original defense. In this battle, we killed or wounded more than ten enemies.
