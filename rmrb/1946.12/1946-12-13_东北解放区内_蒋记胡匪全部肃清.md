    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gangs in the Northeast Liberated Areas have been completely eliminated through the active suppression and appeasement efforts of the military and civilians in various regions. Following the capture of the traitor Xie Wendong on November 20th, Zhang Heizi, the notorious bandit and Chiang Kai-shek's "Vanguard Army" Lieutenant General Commander, was also captured alive by the Yilan mountain search troops of the Hejiang Military Region. Now that the severe winter has arrived, the remaining bandits in various regions are severely lacking in clothing. In mid-November, over a hundred men, including brigade commanders and regimental commanders from the remnants of the traitor Li Huatang's forces, surrendered with their weapons. On December 1st, 133 men, including a detachment commander from Li Deilin's forces, surrendered to the Mudanjiang troops. The bandit leader "Kaoshan" from Heihe and others also recently surrendered to the local garrison with one machine gun and fifty-odd rifles and pistols.

    东北解放区内
    蒋记胡匪全部肃清
    【新华社东北十日电】东北解放区内蒋记胡匪，经各地军民积极剿抚，已将其全部肃清。继谢逆文东于上月二十日就擒后，蒋记“挺进军”中将总指挥惯匪张黑子又为合江军区依兰搜山部队生俘。现严冬已届，各地残匪被服奇缺。上月中旬，李逆华堂残部旅长团长以下携械来归者达百余人。本月一日，李匪德林部支队长以下一百三十三名向牡丹江部队投诚，黑河匪首“靠山”等日前亦携机枪一挺，长短枪五十余枝，向当地驻军投诚。
