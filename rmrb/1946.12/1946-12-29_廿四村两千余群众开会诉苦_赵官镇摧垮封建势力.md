　　More Than Two Thousand People from Twenty-Four Villages Hold Meeting to Voice Grievances
    Zhao Guan Town Crushes Feudal Forces
    [Our newspaper, Jilu Yu, 26th dispatch] In order to implement the land reform policy, He Xi County launched the "returning land to the home" movement, starting with Zhao Guan Town as the base point, and crushed the feudal forces. The five major families, headed by Meng Zhao Xi in Zhao Guan Town, were the biggest local bullies and landlords in the county. Meng Zhao Xi owned 240 mu of land, colluded with bandits, squeezed the peasants, seized land, and committed all kinds of evil. Most of the masses in Zhao Guan Town spontaneously organized into grievance voicing groups. At the struggle meeting against Meng Zhao Xi and Meng Zi Zhen, the sound of gongs and drums shook the sky, and slogans such as "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek selling out the country," "Oppose the local bully landlords exploiting the peasants," and "Demand the return of land to the home" resounded endlessly. In addition to the participation of leading cadres from the entire county, there were more than 2,000 people, including workers, peasants, model teams, children's corps, and women's members from twenty-four villages. At the grievance voicing meeting held at noon, Meng Xian Jun, the son of Meng Zhao Xi, and Meng Zi Zhen, the evil puppet district chief, were brought on stage by their guarantors. The masses presented more than twenty counts of Meng Zhao Xi colluding with bandits, running rampant, and his son Xiao Wu holding weapons, raping women, and seizing land foundations in the seventh year of the Republic of China. When Meng Zi Zhen was the puppet district chief, he embezzled, threatened the masses, beat and detained those who were on duty first, and charged double interest for those who could not afford the expenses; when on official trips, he shielded the five major families from going, always pushing it to the four streets and four villages. Finally, each village elected its own representatives (eleven people per village) to discuss and decide to leave Meng Zhao Xi with thirty mu of land and a house, and Meng Zi Zhen with ten mu of hillside land. The remaining property was handed over to the masses for disposal. The rule of the landlord feudal forces in Zhao Guan Town was crushed, and the land reform movement in the surrounding villages and towns is developing rapidly.

　　廿四村两千余群众开会诉苦
    赵官镇摧垮封建势力
    【本报冀鲁豫廿六日电】为贯彻土地改革政策，河西县开展土地“还家”运动，首先以赵官镇为基点，打垮了封建势力。赵官镇以孟昭僖为首的五大家，是全县的大恶霸地主。孟昭僖有地二顷四十亩，曾勾结土匪，压榨农民，霸占土地，无恶不作。赵官镇大多数群众自动组织成诉苦小组，在斗争孟昭僖、孟子珍的大会上，锣鼓暄天，“反对蒋介石卖国”，“反对恶霸地主剥削农民”，“要求土地回家”的口号声不绝于耳。除全县领导干部均参加外，到有廿四个村的工、农会员、模范班、儿童团、妇女会员，共两千多人。中午开诉苦会，由保证人带领孟昭僖之子孟现钧和恶霸伪区长孟子珍上台，群众提出孟昭僖在民国七年勾结土匪，横行霸道，其子小五拿着武器，强奸民女，霸占地基等二十多条罪状。孟子珍当伪区长时，贪污、威胁群众，当差到的先打后押，拿不上花费的加二倍利息；出差时包庇他五大家不出，总是推到四街四乡。最后各村选出自己代表（一村十一人），共同讨论，决定给孟昭僖留三十亩地，一所房宅，孟子珍一人留十亩坡地。其余财产交给群众处理。赵官镇地主封建势力统治被打垮了，四乡的土地改革运动，飞速的开展起来。
