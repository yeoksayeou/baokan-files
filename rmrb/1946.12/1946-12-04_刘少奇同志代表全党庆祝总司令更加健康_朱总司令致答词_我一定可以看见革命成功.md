　　In the evening, a cadre gathering was held in the Central Auditorium. After Chairman Lin Boqu delivered a speech at the gathering, Liu Shaoqi stepped onto the stage and said, "The cause that Commander-in-Chief Zhu has undertaken for the Chinese people in the past sixty years is the most outstanding crystallization of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, giving the Party and the people tremendous glory." He denounced Chiang Kai-shek's one-man-show "National Assembly" as a puppet national assembly, and he vehemently condemned Chiang's attacks on the Liberated Areas. He said, "They want to use this to scare the Chinese people, but the people will never and cannot be scared! The more than one million troops and people in all the Liberated Areas have launched a heroic war of self-defense to smash Chiang Kai-shek's attacks on the Liberated Areas and Yan'an, to celebrate the Commander-in-Chief's birthday (enthusiastic applause). The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region celebrates the Commander-in-Chief's birthday with eighteen captured tanks and more than six hundred artillery pieces. Chiang Kai-shek is merely outwardly strong but inwardly weak. If he has the guts to attack Yan'an, we will thoroughly eliminate and crush him." Finally, on behalf of the entire Party, he wished the Commander-in-Chief more joy and health, which symbolizes the Party and the Chinese people becoming even stronger and victorious. Then, Zhou Enlai was invited to deliver a speech (see our newspaper's telegraph yesterday). Comrade Enlai read with an impassioned and sonorous voice, and the entire audience applauded continuously. Next, Vice Chairman Li Dingming of the Border Region Government spoke, saying, "Today, celebrating Commander-in-Chief Zhu's birthday is celebrating the birthday of all 450 million people in the country." After recalling the history of the Commander-in-Chief from the Xinhai Revolution to the War of Resistance Against Japan, Vice Chairman Li denounced Chiang Kai-shek for willingly being an enemy of the people. He said, "Today, we must eliminate these enemies of the people." Finally, Commander-in-Chief Zhu delivered a reply speech. He first thanked the Border Region Government and guests from all walks of life for their congratulations. Then, he said that the Chinese people had been engaged in revolution very early on, advancing wave upon wave, but the revolutionary partners they encountered often proved unreliable, such as those who pretended to be revolutionary but aimed to get promoted and get rich. Each time after gaining the fruits of the revolution, they turned around to suppress the revolution, leading to repeated failures and repeated deception of the people. The Commander-in-Chief said, "I am the son of a peasant. All sons of peasants want to make revolution. It was unsuccessful back then because we couldn't find the way. Later, we found it and joined the Chinese Communist Party." When mentioning Chiang Kai-shek's collusion with American imperialists to attack the Chinese people, the Commander-in-Chief humorously said, "Although I am already sixty years old, the age of imperialism is much, much older than me! How much longer can they live! The reactionaries are bound to fail, and the Chinese people are bound to win. For most Chinese people, living to sixty is considered enough. After that, it's all bonus for me. I am confident that I can personally see the Chinese revolution succeed." (The audience applauded excitedly and continuously). In the evening, the Peking opera "Dingjun Mountain" was performed, and a grand ball was held in the dance hall at the same time.

　　刘少奇同志代表全党庆祝总司令更加健康
  　朱总司令致答词
  　我一定可以看见革命成功
    入晚，中央大礼堂举行干部晚会，在晚会上主席林伯渠致词后，刘少奇即上台讲话，他说：“朱总司令六十年来为中国人民所作的事业，是中国共产党和中国人民最优秀的结晶，给予党和人民以极大的光荣”。他指斥蒋介石一手包办的“国大”为伪国大，并痛斥蒋氏对解放区的进攻。他说：“他们想借此吓倒中国人民，但人民是绝不会也不可能被吓倒的！全解放区一百多万军队和人民，已进行英勇的自卫战争，以粉碎蒋介石对于解放区和延安的进攻来庆贺总司令的寿诞（热烈鼓掌）。冀鲁豫以缴获的十八辆坦克，六百多门大炮庆祝总司令的大寿，蒋介石只是外强中干，如果他有胆量敢于进攻延安，我们将予以彻底消灭和粉碎”。最后他代表全党祝总司令更加愉快健康，这就象征着党和中国人民的更加健壮胜利。继邀周恩来致词（见本报昨日电讯）恩来同志朗读时，声音激昂宏亮，全场掌声不绝。继由边府李鼎铭副主席讲话，他说：“今天为朱总司令做寿，就是为全国四万万五千万人做寿”。李副主席于追忆总司令自辛亥革命到抗日战争的历史后，斥蒋介石甘为人民公敌，他说：“今天要扫除这些人民公敌”。最后由朱总司令答词，他首先对边府和各界来宾祝贺致谢，继称：中国人民很早就干革命，前仆后继，但屡次遇见的革命伙伴就往往不大靠得住，比如那些假装革命而以升官发财为目的的人们，每次在获得革命果实后却反转来镇压革命，致屡次失败，人民屡次上当。总司令说：“我是一个农民的儿子，所有农民的儿子都是要革命的，那时不成功是摸不到路，后来找到了，加入了中国共产党。”在述及蒋介石勾结美帝国主义者进攻中国人民时，总司令幽默地说：“我虽然已六十岁，但帝国主义的年纪却比我大得多多哩！他们还能活多久！反动派一定失败，中国人民一定胜利。中国一般人活到六十就算够本了，以后我就是赚的了，我自信可以亲自看到中国革命获得成功。（台下兴奋鼓掌持久不绝）。晚会上，演出平剧《定军山》并同时在舞厅举行盛大舞会。
