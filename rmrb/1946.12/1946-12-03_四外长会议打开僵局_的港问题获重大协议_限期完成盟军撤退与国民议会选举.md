　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. New York dispatch: The deadlock at the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting regarding the Trieste Free Territory issue has been broken, and a major agreement has been reached. This is a direct result of the consultations between Molotov and Byrnes on the 25th. The four foreign ministers held consecutive meetings starting on the 26th, reaching agreement on five points regarding the Trieste issue: (1) Regarding the withdrawal of Allied forces, Molotov pointed out that Byrnes' proposal (which proposed first reducing the number of stationed troops before withdrawal) implied that troops should be withdrawn after the treaty came into effect. No one at the meeting opposed this interpretation. Subsequently, it was decided that troops should be withdrawn within three months after the treaty came into effect, with the exception if the Governor of Trieste deemed an extension necessary to ensure the security of Trieste. (2) Regarding the National Assembly, Molotov suggested that it be elected within four months after the treaty came into effect, and the four foreign ministers also reached an agreement in principle. (3) Regarding the interim government, the four foreign ministers agreed that the Governor should appoint it after consultation with the Italian and Yugoslav governments. (4) Regarding the selection of the Governor, Molotov proposed that the four powers agree on it before the treaty came into effect, and the foreign ministers also agreed. (5) An agreement was also reached regarding the right to issue laws during the transition period. Thus, the main difficulties in completing the Italian peace treaty have been resolved. In addition, the four foreign ministers also discussed the issue of reparations. Byrnes agreed to withdraw the US objection to Hungary's reparations of $300 million to the Soviet Union. The four foreign ministers also discussed the Danube River issue. Molotov proposed that the US should return the detained ships, and Byrnes replied that instructions for return had been issued. Due to these agreements, it is expected that the Five-Power Peace Treaty may be completed before Christmas.
