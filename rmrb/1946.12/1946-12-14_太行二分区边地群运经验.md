Experiences in Mass Mobilization in the Border Areas of the Second Taihang District

I. Characteristics of the Border Areas and the Basic Demands of the Masses

The land distribution in the border areas was extremely unreasonable. According to statistics from Yuci, the landlords, who accounted for 11% of the population, controlled 29% of the best land, with an average of 13 to 15 mu per person. In contrast, the middle and poor peasants, who made up 89% of the population, had only an average of 3 to 5 mu of poor land per person. The tenant relationships were complex, and debt relationships were very serious. There were a particularly large number of hired laborers, some of whom had been laborers for nine generations. It was common for landlords to beat or expel hired laborers, and some even went unpaid for eighteen years. Landlords engaged in speculative trade, causing many peasants to lose their fortunes. Coupled with the long-term rule of the enemy and puppet regime, the traitors, local bullies, and landlords had formed a blood feud with the peasants through murder and torture. In addition, the landlords organized "Homecoming Legions" and "Revenge Squads" to threaten the peasants' emancipation, capture and kill the masses, and seize the fruits of the struggle, making it impossible for the people to live and produce in peace. The masses urgently demanded the suppression of special agents, resistance against landlord armed forces, and armed defense of their emancipation.

II. Overview of the Development of Mass Mobilization in the Border Areas in August and September

In the past, mass mobilization had been attempted in the old liberated areas, but it had not been successful. After the anti-traitor struggle in the new areas, a group of activists had been mobilized, and the peasants had obtained some land. Preliminary militia and peasant associations were established, and the Party began to be established, but many problems remained. In addition, some areas had not been mobilized at all.

Encouraged by the Central Committee's "May 4th Directive," the district committee organized "emancipation teams" and designated "emancipation zones," focusing on Pingding, Shouyang, Yuci, Taiyuan, and Qi County. They seized the opportunity during lulls in the war to carry out the movement. Their specific methods were: first, to remove obstacles to the movement (such as poor composition of cadres or unfair distribution of fruits of struggle); second, to arrange war order, stabilize emotions, and establish emancipation order to enter the struggle; third, to train activists and organize forces for struggle. The movement quickly entered a climax from point to area. The masses demanded that the struggle be thorough, focusing on striking the most prominent traitors and local bullies, hitting hard, accurately, and painfully. After the climax, more masses were absorbed into the organization, and questions were raised such as: Was emancipation complete? Had feudal forces been defeated? These issues were discussed to deepen the struggle. In the later stage of the in-depth phase, the Yan Xishan puppet troops constantly harassed and nibbled away at the area. The masses strongly demanded weapons to defend the fruits they had recovered, and the task of joining the war was quickly surpassed in a few days.

III. Several Key Experiences

1. Give the people of the border areas support and let them take the lead, strengthen their will to fight, and dispel ideological concerns.

The people of the border areas were in a volatile situation, constantly threatened by the stubborn enemy and puppet regime. Therefore, it was essential for the leadership to provide support and let them take the lead, dispelling ideological concerns, as the primary task in carrying out the struggle in the border areas. They were originally afraid of retaliation from the "Revenge Squad," but after discussion, they realized that "they cannot live as sheep" and broke with the idea of compromise. They also proposed "three people with one mind can turn loess into gold" and "strength in numbers," establishing the idea of unity and struggle. Furthermore, the question "who sold materials and impoverished the peasants" stirred up even those who could not find the root of their poverty to speak out their grievances. In order to "defeat the local Yan Xishan in the village," everyone swore not to reveal secrets, implemented a five-household guarantee system, and the peasant association rules also stipulated that if the enemy captured anyone, they should not give up anyone or reveal any secrets. In addition, the masses also put forward their own strategies: "Farmers all over the world are one family," "Big doors for the big, wash faces and blacken them for the small," "Deal with the evil evilly, and the good kindly." For the fleeing landlords nearby, they said, "Those who flee leave their crimes, those who stay leave their livelihood." This opened up the situation for struggle.

2. Train a large number of activists to ignite the movement and lead the way. Train more to avoid singling them out. Furthermore, uniting the middle peasants made the force even more powerful.

3. Combine mass mobilization with arming the masses: Due to the acute nature of the struggle environment in the border areas, the masses urgently demanded weapons. Therefore, combining mass mobilization with arming the masses to carry out mass-based struggles against the enemy was a key aspect of the struggle in the border areas. Without mass mobilization, the struggle against the enemy would be weak. Mobilizing the masses without armed support and combining with armed masses would make the masses lack backbone and dare not bravely stand up to fight. Therefore, the process of mobilizing the masses was the process of arming the masses. However, attention should be paid to planning and taking the initiative to strike the enemy, and organizing militia rotation teams in various districts to support the emancipation movement in the border areas. Emphasize developing local militia; while emancipating, develop or reorganize the militia on a large scale so that the peasants truly grasp weapons and become the pillar of mass mobilization in the border areas. Some villages first organized militia to suppress special agents and launched the struggle. They also implemented martial law during the struggle, prohibiting contact with enemy-occupied areas to prevent landlords from escaping. At the same time, pay attention to developing and consolidating the Party organization in the border areas.

IV. Guidance Issues for Struggle in Border Areas

In the movement in the border areas, the great traitors, great bullies, and great landlords should be resolutely and thoroughly eliminated, while the small and medium landlords should not be excessively harmed. First, strike the big and bad ones, as the masses say, "Strike the tiger first at the head, capture the bandit first capture the chief." Second, strike hard, strike accurately, and narrow the scope of the strike, widening the scope of benefit. Focus on striking the big ones, while the small ones wash their faces and blacken them [meaning a light punishment], and the number of households benefiting is generally around 80%, with some villages in Ping’an reaching 87%. Third, seize first and then struggle, those who flee leave their crimes, those who stay leave their livelihood. Fourth, in terms of organizational policy, prepare for concealment, take a long-term view, in case of emergency. Fifth, in terms of struggle methods, use all quick methods, seize the time, and mobilize quickly. Struggle piece by piece, together, so that the masses' emotions are high. The fruits should be distributed as the struggle progresses to strengthen the masses' thinking; if they cannot be distributed immediately, they should be stored separately and then adjusted, so that they are not robbed by the enemy. Sixth, in terms of organizing forces, the experience of various places proves that it is better to organize armed emancipation teams, which can help the masses to emancipate themselves and at the same time organize mass guerrilla warfare.

    太行二分区边地群运经验
    一、边地特点和群众的基本要求
    边地的土地分配是极不合理的，根据榆次的统计，百分之十一的地主们经营地主及带有封建尾巴的富农即占有百分之二十九的好地，每人平均十三到十五亩，而百分之八十九的中贫农，每人仅平均三到五亩薄地。租佃关系很复杂，债务关系也非常严重。雇工特别多，有些当了九辈子的雇工。打死或驱逐雇工更是常事，甚至有十八年不算工资者。地主贩卖料子，使很多农民荡产，加上敌伪长期的统治，汉奸恶霸地主的杀人或吊打，与农民结成了血海深仇。另外，地主更组织“还乡团”“复仇队”，威胁农民翻身，或捕杀群众，抢夺斗争果实，使人民不能安心生产。群众急于要求镇压特务，顶住地主武装，要求武装保卫翻身。
  二、八九两月边地群运发展的概况
    过去在老区曾发动过群众，但没发动起来。新区经过反奸斗争，曾发动了一批积极分子，农民得到了一部分土地，初步有了民兵农会，开始建立了党，但遗留问题很多。另外还有一些地区干脆就没动。
    在中央“五四”指示鼓舞下，地委组织了翻身队，划分了翻身区，以平定、寿阳、榆太祁为重点，抓紧了战争的空隙，把运动开展起来。他们的具体做法：一是扫除运动的障碍（如干部的成份不好或果实分配不公等）。二是安排战争秩序，稳定情绪，建立翻身秩序进入斗争。三是训练积极分子，组织斗争力量。运动一开始就很快由点到面的进入高潮。群众要求斗争要彻底，集中打击奸霸大头子，要打的痛，打的狠，打的准。高潮过后，吸收了更多的群众加入组织，提出翻身彻底没有？封建势力打垮没有等问题，让大家讨论，把斗争引向深入。至深入阶段后期，阎伪军不断袭扰蚕食，群众强烈的要求武装，保卫已收回的果实，参战的任务也在几天内很快的超过了。
  三、几点主要的经验
    １、给边地人民撑腰作主，坚定斗争意志，解除思想顾虑。
    边地人民的处境动荡，常受顽伪的威胁，因此领导上给以撑腰作主，解除思想顾虑是开展边地斗争的首要问题。他们原来怕“复仇队”报复，不敢动，但经大家讨论，认定“当绵羊不能活”，打破了妥协思想。又提出“三人一条心，黄土变成金”，“人多力大”，树立了团结斗争的思想。更从“什么人卖料子弄穷了农民”的追问中，使找不到穷根的也掀起诉苦。为了“打掉村里的小阎锡山”，全体宣誓不泄露秘密，实行五家连环保，农会纪律中也规定敌人抓住不供出任何人，不泄露任何秘密。另外，群众更提出自己的策略：“天下农民是一家”，“大的大门，小的洗脸擦黑”，“恶的恶办，善的善办”，对附近逃亡地主则是“跑的留罪恶，在家的留生活”。这样，便打开了斗争局面。
    ２、大批训练积极分子，点火带头，掀起运动。可以多训练些，避免突出。更因团结了中农，使力量更加浩大。
    ３、发动群众与武装群众相结合：边地群众由于斗争环境的尖锐，迫切要求武装，因此发动群众与武装群众开展群众性的对敌斗争，是边地斗争的主要一环。不发动群众则对敌斗争表现无力，发动群众而没有武装支援与武装群众结合，则群众腰不硬，不敢勇敢的起来斗争。因之发动群众的过程就是武装群众的过程，但应注意计划自己主动打击敌人，并组织各区民兵轮防队，以支援边地翻身运动。强调发展当地民兵；一面翻身，一面大量发展或改造民兵，使农民切实掌握武装，成为边地群运的支柱。有些村是先组织民兵镇压特务开展了斗争，并实行斗争时戒严，禁绝与敌占区来往，防止地主逃跑。同时注意发展并整顿边地党的组织。
  四、边地斗争指导问题
    在边地运动中，对大汉奸大恶霸大地主应坚决彻底消灭之，对中小地主则不过分伤害他们。一、先打大的坏的，即群众说：“打虎先打头，擒贼先擒王”。二、打的狠，打的中，打的面窄，得利面宽。集中打大的，小的洗脸擦黑，得利户一般在百分之八十左右，平安有些村达到百分之八十七。三、先扣后斗，跑了的留罪恶，在家的留生活。四、组织方针上，应准备隐蔽，从长期着眼，以防万一。五、在斗争方式上，要用一切快的方针，抓紧时间，很快发动。斗争一片片的一齐斗，这样群众情绪高。果实要随斗随分，可以坚定群众思想；万一不能马上分，则分头保管，然后再调剂，不要被敌人抢走。六、在组织力量上各地经验证明，组织武装翻身队较好，一面帮助群众翻身，同时可以组织群众游击战争。
