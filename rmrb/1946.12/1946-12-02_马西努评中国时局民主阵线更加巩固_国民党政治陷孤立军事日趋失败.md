Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 29th: Moscow, November 28th broadcast, Soviet commentator Masinu, in discussing the Chinese situation, pointed out that both the political and military situations are currently unfavorable to the Kuomintang. Masinu said, "The Kuomintang reactionary clique's attempt to use the National Assembly to split the Chinese democratic front, fabricate public opinion, and isolate the Chinese Communist Party has not only failed, but on the contrary, the democratic front has become more consolidated after gloriously undergoing arduous tests. It is not the Communist Party that is being isolated, but the Kuomintang authorities. It is not others who are splitting, but precisely the Kuomintang authorities themselves, and this split will soon widen." Regarding the military situation, Masinu said, "Since the Kuomintang army launched a large-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas in July, the strength of the People's Revolutionary Army has been further enhanced, while the strength of the Kuomintang army has been artificially weakened. They are unable to compensate for the losses of their troops, and the peasant uprisings have created a second battlefield in the rear of the Kuomintang army. Under these circumstances, the Kuomintang's recent deployment of a new large-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas is not because it feels strong, but only shows that it feels its strength is weakening day by day and is making a desperate attempt."

　　马西努评中国时局民主阵线更加巩固
  　国民党政治陷孤立军事日趋失败
    【新华社延安十一月二十九日电】莫斯科二十八日广播，苏评论员马西努论中国时局时，指出目前政治军事都对国民党不利。马西努说：“国民党反动集团利用国大，借以分裂中国民主阵线，假造民意，孤立中共的意图，不但没有成功，相反地民主阵线由于光辉地经过了艰苦的考验，更加巩固起来了。受孤立的不是共产党，而是国民党当局。分裂的不是别人，而恰恰是国民党当局本身，这种分裂还要很快地扩大起来。”谈到军事形势，马西努说：“自七月间国民党军大举进攻解放区以来，人民革命军的力量已更为增强，国民党军的力量却人为削弱，抓了不能补偿其军队的损失，而农民的起义已使国民党军的后方发生第二战场。在这种情况之下，国民党最近布置对解放区的新的大举进攻，并不是由于它感觉自己强大，而只是表明了它感到自己力量日益削弱而作的绝望的企图而已”。
