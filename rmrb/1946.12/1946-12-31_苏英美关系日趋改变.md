　　Soviet-British-American Relations Increasingly Changing - International Week
　　At the time of the anniversary of the Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, and Truman's statement on American policy towards China, American domestic public opinion has recently been criticizing American policy towards China over the past year. Senators Morse and Flanders have issued statements demanding that the authorities cease all aid and unilateral "mediation" to Chiang Kai-shek, and suggesting a round table conference of representatives from Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and all Chinese parties to discuss the China problem. Obviously, the US authorities' policy towards China over the past year has completely abandoned its promise of a year ago. Truman's statement on the 18th of this month, in order to evade accusations from all sides, will hardly deceive American and foreign public opinion.
　　In addition to the China problem, other parts of the East have also been eventful recently. Although the Iranian reactionaries, with the support of the US and Britain, occupied the capital of the Azerbaijan autonomous region, the people there are still persisting in their struggle. In Vietnam, the Republic government led by Ho Chi Minh is conducting a full-scale resistance against the French army's unreasonable provocations. In the East Indies, the people of Borneo and Celebes islands are demanding complete independence and joining the Indonesian Republic. In India, the people are spontaneously rising up to carry out armed struggles against landlords' feudal exploitation. In Japan, the 400,000-person demonstration in Tokyo on the 17th demanding the cabinet's resignation and the recent demonstrations by civil servants and teachers have deepened the crisis of the Yoshida Cabinet.
　　Echoing the armed struggles of the people in various parts of the East against foreign interventionists and domestic reactionaries, the Greek people formally established the Greek Democratic Army in their self-defense war, vowing to fight to the end for domestic democracy and demanding the withdrawal of British troops.
　　In addition, British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech on the 22nd is particularly noteworthy. He declared: "Britain is not constrained by the United States or any other country in formulating its foreign policy." "Britain is geographically and in its way of life between the United States and the Soviet Union." Regarding Bevin's words, as Labour Party progressive Member of Parliament Zilliacus said: "It depends on actions." Even so, it is the first time that an official British statement has stated that it is "between the United States and the Soviet Union." Moreover, it should be pointed out that Bevin's statement was issued under the following circumstances: (1) The extensive criticism within the British Labour Party of Bevin's pro-American and anti-Soviet foreign policy was already evident in the House of Commons incident in October; recently, when Bevin returned to Britain from the United States, voices of opposition rose again. (2) British Labour Party members are very fearful of the impending American economic crisis, and mostly advocate avoiding overly close political and economic ties with the United States. (3) In addition to previously expressing "concern" about India, the US officialdom has recently expressed "concern" about Burma, wants to participate in the Palestine Conference, and the Pauley reparations plan helps Japanese textile industry compete with British Lancashire owners, and American businessmen are planning to compete with Britain for Far East shipping... All this has caused Downing Street a great headache. At this time, news came that British Chief of Staff Montgomery has accepted Stalin's invitation to visit the Soviet Union in late January next year. The trend of changing interrelationships between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly apparent. (December 29th)

### 苏英美关系日趋改变

　　苏英美关系日趋改变  国际一周
    当此苏英美三国外长莫斯科会议及杜鲁门关于美国对华政策声明一周年之际，最近美国国内舆论纷纷批评一年来美国对华政策。参议员莫莱与佛兰德斯等发表文告，要求当局停止对蒋介石之一切援助及片面“调解”，并建议召开英美苏法及中国各党派代表之圆桌会议，以商谈中国问题。显然，一年来美当局的对华政策，完全背弃了它在一年前的诺言。杜鲁门本月十八日为了搪塞各方责难的声明，势难蒙蔽美国内外舆论。
    除中国问题外，东方其他各地近来亦是多事之秋。虽然伊朗反动派在美英支持下侵占阿塞尔拜疆自治的首府，但该地人民仍在坚持斗争。而在越南，胡志明领导的共和国政府正对法军无理挑衅进行全面抵抗。在东印，婆罗洲与西里伯斯两岛人民要求完全独立及加入印尼共和国。在印度，人民自动起来进行武装斗争，反对地主封建剥削。在日本，有十七日之东京四十万人倒阁大示威及最近之公务员与教员示威，已加深了吉田内阁的危机。
    与东方各地人民反对外国干涉者及国内反动派的武装斗争相呼应，希腊人民于自卫战争中正式成立希腊民主军，誓为国内民主与要求英军撤退而奋斗到底。
    此外，英外相贝文二十二日的演说殊堪注意。他宣称：“英国在拟订外交政策时，并不受美国或任何其他国家之牵制。”“英国在地理上及生活方式上均介乎美苏之间。”对于贝文这些话，如工党进步议员齐里亚库斯所说的：“要看行动。”虽然如此，但英官方声明“介乎美苏之间”尚以此为首次。而且应该指出，贝文声明是在下述情况下发表的，即：（一）英工党内部广泛抨击贝文的亲美反苏外交政策，早见于十月下院事件中；近当贝文自美返英时，反对之声又起。（二）英工党人士对美国经济危机必将到来甚为恐惧，多主避免与美国发生过于密切之政治经济联系。（三）美官方除前表示“关心”印度外，近又表示“关心”缅甸，要参加巴勒斯坦会议，鲍莱赔偿计划又助日纺织业与英国兰开夏业主们竞争，美商正筹划与英争夺远东航运，……。凡此，已使唐宁街大形头痛。适于此时，消息传来，英参谋总长蒙哥马利已应斯大林之邀将于明年一月下旬赴苏。英美苏三国之间相互关系的趋向改变，已日益明显了。（十二月二十九日）
