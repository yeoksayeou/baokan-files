Praises to the Four Big Families
    Lü Ban

　　Chiang

　　A thousand years of feudalism forged in one furnace: a gourd-shaped head and Eastern barbarian beard;
    A butcher's arms and a yamen runner's legs, spinal column filled with paste;
    Skilled at flattery and good at kneeling, boneless and needing support;
    Wearing a crown of dictatorship, embracing a Bagua diagram of autocracy;
    A string of human skull beads hangs on his chest, silently chanting "Fascist" incantations.
    Blood wine is poured into a jade cup, a golden throne presses down on a skull.
    His enlightenment teacher was Zeng Wenzheng, his role models were Hitler's dark monsters;
    Uncle Sam's adopted son (note), a demonic fox throughout the ages!
    Note: The transliteration of the American nickname "Uncle Sam."

　　Soong

　　Dashing and youthful, the only son of the Soong family.
    A Panama hat worn since childhood, foreign leather shoes always worn;
    English is better than Chinese, treasonous commercial treaties signed with ease.
    Crossing the ocean for his brother-in-law, always praising his younger brother-in-law's virtue with laughter.
    Especially fond of Washington, moving west all year round;
    A longtime patron of the Citibank, with fields and gardens in Brazil.
    Begging American generals to be advisors, simply appointing Englishmen to head the customs.
    Starving the yellow-faced Chinese people, so he can spend his remaining years in New York.

　　Kung

　　A thieving official from a ticket shop, his whole body reeks of copper;
    Seeking fame and fortune through women's skirts, always pleasing the Madam.
    His fat head is best at drilling into money holes, his stout body resembles a cast silver dollar.
    Winning by surprise on the stock exchange, strategizing with a calculating abacus.
    Treating the Central Bank as his private treasury, issuing banknotes like crazy in billions and trillions;
    Gold and silver transported from the sky, the fat of the people his meals.
    Resigning to concentrate on being a comprador, forming companies to hand over concessions,
    Monopolizing China's endless wealth, in the end, inevitably hung upside down.

　　The Two Chens

　　A giant axe splits open the gates of hell, the Two Chens are the most vicious on earth!
    Party-style education turns people into dogs, secret agents run rampant and dogs eat people.
    Demonic claws extend throughout thirty-five provinces, party ruffians and corrupt officials plunder the people.
    The Labor Party locks the hands of youth, monopolizes culture and censors news.
    Boasting about their good methods in public, they have killed 300,000 young people.
    Personally plotting assassination plans in Shanghai, secretly plotting to harm Li and Wen in Yunnan.
    Their ambition unfulfilled, organizing the National Assembly, stirring up muddy waters to grab profits.
    Himmler and Goebbels, how long can your tyranny last?

  　蒋
　
    千年封建淬一炉：葫芦脑袋东洋胡；
    屠夫胳膊衙役腿，脊椎骨里装浆糊；
    精于拍马擅长跪，肉里无骨待人扶；
    头戴独裁冠一顶，怀抱专制八卦图；
    胸前一串人顶骨，默诵“法西”数念珠。
    翡翠杯中斟血酒，黄金宝座压骷髅。
    启蒙先师曾文正，希魔黑怪好门徒；
    山姆大叔干儿子（注），万古云霄一妖狐！
    注：美国的绰号Uncle San的译音。
　
  　宋
　
    风度翩翩似少年，宋家儿女独一男。
    巴拿便帽自幼戴，花旗革履一向穿；
    英文原比汉文好，卖国商约信手签。
    漂洋过海为姐夫，笑语常夸内弟贤。
    专门喜欢华盛顿，一年四季往西搬；
    花旗银行老主顾，巴西国里有田园。
    跪求美将作顾问，简派英人长海关。
    饿死中华黄面孔，好去纽约度余年。
　
　  孔
　
    票号门中一贼官，周身铜臭气冲天；
    罗裙带上求名利，夫人膝下常承欢。
    肥头最善钻钱孔，胖体恰似铸银元。
    出奇制胜交易所，运筹帷幄铁算盘。
    中央银行充私库，钞票狂发亿万千；
    黄金白银天上运，民脂民膏腹中餐。
    罢官专心营买办，合组公司送利权，
    垄断中华无穷富，到头难免头倒悬。
　
  　二陈
　
    巨斧劈开地狱门，人间恶毒数二陈！
    党化教育人学狗，特务横行狗吃人。
    魔爪伸遍卅五省，党痞贪官劫万民。
    劳动党锁青年手，垄断文化剪新闻。
    人前自夸手段好，曾戮青年卅万名。
    赴沪亲布暗杀纲，在滇阴谋害李、闻。
    野心未已搞国大，为摸肥鱼水搅浑。
    希姆勒与戈培尔，问尔横行能几春？
