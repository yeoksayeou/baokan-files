Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st -- Yesterday was the auspicious occasion of Commander-in-Chief Zhu's sixtieth birthday. The entire city of Yan'an was filled with jubilation, amidst the tense and excited atmosphere of successfully completing self-defense preparations and frequent good news from the front. The birthday celebration hall was set up in the auditorium of the CCP Central Committee's office building. A large "Longevity" character made of yellow rice paste adorned the entrance curtain of the hall. On the central wall of the hall hung Chairman Mao's inscription "The Glory of the People" and the CCP Central Committee's banner "Eternal Youth." A lush green fern was placed beneath it, with a paper-cut golden Longevity character hanging above. On either side were congratulatory couplets from the Secretariat of the CCP Central Committee. The tables in the room were filled with longevity peaches, and the walls were covered with congratulatory messages from all sides.

　　At 1 p.m., General Zhu De arrived by car from the headquarters. The Commander-in-Chief was wearing a cloak, a gray cloth military uniform, and a black leather hat. He was full of spirit and as strong as a middle-aged man. As he got out of the car, the crowds on both sides of the road vied to see him and raised their hands to salute him. Upon arriving at the birthday hall, the sound of gongs and drums filled the air, and those offering birthday greetings came in an endless stream. The staff of the Yan'an Headquarters were the first to arrive in formation, led by red and white彩旗 banners with the words "Long Live Commander-in-Chief Zhu" written on them. The Joint Defense Army Headquarters and the Political Department placed a large portrait of the Commander-in-Chief at the head of their column, followed by armed troops. The Yan'an City Chamber of Commerce and people from all walks of life arrived amidst the joyful sounds of folk musicians. Mr. Bi Guangdou, Wu Hanzhang, Wang Kewen and others also came in person. Among the congratulatory gifts from all sides, the red骏马 horse presented by the business community was the most eye-catching. In front of the birthday hall, various theatrical troupes performed Yangko dances. In addition to receiving and thanking everyone, the Commander-in-Chief also delivered a short speech. Labor heroes Wu Manyou, Yang Buhao, and Zhang Yongtai, a former landlord from Yan'an, also came to offer birthday greetings. The Commander-in-Chief sat with them and inquired in detail about this year's production situation. Wu Manyou said, when discussing the village's self-defense: "The peasants have responded to the call of the Commander-in-Chief and have armed themselves. We will definitely be able to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." A five-pointed star sent by a certain unit of our field army, made of weapons captured from the Japanese during the War of Resistance, was particularly exciting. Four combat heroes from the unit, including Han Xingyuan, traveled dozens of miles from their station to attend. Han Xingyuan told reporters: "I came to defend the border region and Yan'an." He had single-handedly routed an enemy platoon in a certain battle this year, killing eleven enemies and capturing six rifles. They assured the Commander-in-Chief in the meeting that they would resolutely meet the invaders and defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to celebrate the Commander-in-Chief's birthday. Among the foreign guests, Soviet doctor Minikovski, U.S. representative Colonel Sheluosi of the Peiping Executive Headquarters, Major Baitele, U.S. military observer Lieutenant Colonel Lake, U.S. reporter Ms. Strong, and Mr. Rodley all brought gifts to offer their congratulations. At 5 p.m., the Commander-in-Chief invited Yan'an cadres and celebrities from all walks of life to a dinner party.

    【新华社延安一日电】昨日为朱总司令六秩寿诞佳节，整个延安在胜利完成自卫备战及前方捷报频传的紧张兴奋空气中，处处充满着欢腾。寿堂设于中共中央办公厅礼堂，大厅内门首庆祝布帘上以黄米胶成大“寿”字，寿堂正中墙壁上有毛主席题“人民的光荣”和中共中央委员会之贺幛“万年长青”。一株青绿之凤尾草置其下，上悬剪纸金寿字，两旁是中共中央书记处的贺联，室内桌上，尽置寿桃，墙壁为各方所送之贺词布满。
    下午一时，朱德将军自总部驱车驾临。总司令披斗蓬，着灰布军装，戴黑皮帽，精神奕奕，健壮如中年人。下车后，途中两崖人群争望，并举手向其致敬。至寿堂后，即闻锣鼓喧天，各方拜寿者络绎于途。延安总部工作人员最先整队前往。领以红白彩旗，上书“朱总司令万岁”。联防军司令部、政治部以总司令大幅肖像置队首，后殿以荷枪之部队。延市商会暨各界市民则在民间吹鼓手欢奏声中来到，毕光斗、吴汉章、王克温等先生亦亲临。各方贺礼中，以商界献赠之红色骏马最引人注目。寿堂前边各剧团演出秧歌，总司令除一一接待致谢外，并发表简短演说。劳动英雄吴满有、杨步浩及延安旧日地主张永泰均往拜寿，总司令与其围坐，详询今年生产状况。吴满有在谈及该村自卫时说：“农民已经响应总司令的号召，武装起来，我们一定能够打垮蒋介石的进攻”。我野战军某部送来之祝寿五角星，系抗战中缴获日本人之武器扎成，尤使人兴奋。该部战斗英雄韩兴元等四人，均自驻地数十里赶来。韩兴元语记者：“我为保卫边区和延安而来”。他于今年某次战斗中，曾单独击溃敌人一个排，毙敌十一名，并缴获步枪六支。他们在座中向总司令保证，以坚决迎击进犯者，保卫党中央和毛主席来庆贺总司令大寿。外宾中苏联医生米尼柯夫斯基、北平调处执行部美方代表谢路士上校、白特乐少校、美军观察组雷克中校、美记者史特朗女士、罗德利先生等均持礼物前往祝贺。下午五时，总司令邀请延安干部及各界名流聚餐。
