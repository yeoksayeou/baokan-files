　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Chenggong Lake News: The issue of investigating the military has been submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion on the 11th. The submitted proposal requires member states to report the following four items of information to the United Nations Secretary-General: (1) Information on the troops stationed by each country in other United Nations territories; (2) Information on the troops stationed by each country in former enemy countries; (3) Information on the army, navy, and air force bases of each country; (4) Information on the number of regular troops stationed domestically and abroad. Molotov declared at the meeting that the fourth provision should be canceled because the domestic troops involved do not belong to the issue of investigating troops stationed abroad, and this provision only aims to divert countries' attention from the issue of foreign troops stationed abroad. Moreover, this provision only involves reporting the number of troops and does not include weapons, which may produce incorrect phenomena. The U.S. and Britain equate domestic and foreign troop stationing, and their purpose is only to delay reporting foreign troop stationing. U.S. representative Connally rose to defend, saying that the Soviet Union attaches too much importance to weapons. Molotov then attacked the United States for hiding atomic bombs and rockets. The U.S. and British representatives also said that the Soviet Union possessed a large number of regular troops. The French representative then rose to support the Soviet Union, saying that only the first three items in the proposal belong to the scope of investigating troops stationed, and the fourth item should belong to the scope of disarmament. Other representatives did not speak at this time. At this moment, Soviet representative Vyshinsky suddenly stood up and asked: "May I ask which country in the U.S.-British group dares to agree to add the words 'weapons' to the proposal?" The situation suddenly became tense, and the British representative suddenly stood up and declared that he was willing to immediately accept the Soviet representative's challenging suggestion, firmly stating that when an appropriate international supervisory agency is established, Britain will agree to report weapons at the same time. He then suggested establishing an international supervisory agency that could investigate the facts at the request of the United Nations General Assembly or the Security Council. Molotov then rose to criticize the British new proposal as "too vague," but finally stated: it can be accepted in principle. According to a report by the Associated Press reporter: The British new proposal was beyond the expectations of the U.S. representative. The United States is currently unwilling to disclose the secrets of atomic bomb manufacturing. After six hours of intense debate, the General Assembly decided to return the British and Soviet amendments to the subcommittee for discussion.

　　联大讨论国外驻军问题
    四强发生激辩
    法赞助苏联不讨论国内驻军
    英允调查武器出乎美方意料
    【新华社延安十四日电】成功湖讯：调查军队问题已于十一日提交联合国全体大会讨论，所提交之建议要求各会员国以下列四项情报报告联合国秘书长：（一）各国在其他联合国境内之驻军情报；（二）各国在前敌国境内之驻军情报；（三）各国外陆海空军基地之情报；（四）驻于国内及国外常备军人数之情报。莫洛托夫于会上宣称，第四项规定应取消，因其所涉及之国内军队不属于调查驻军问题，此项规定仅在于转移各国对国外驻军问题注意之。而且此项规定，仅涉及报告军队人数，未将武器列入，可能产生不正确现象。美英两国将国内与国外驻军相提并论，目的只在延缓报告国外驻军。美代表康纳利起而辩护，谓苏联对武器太重视。莫洛托夫即抨击美国匿藏原子弹及火箭，美英代表又谓苏联拥有大量常备军。法代表继起赞助苏联称：建议案中仅前三项系属于调查驻军范围，第四项则当属裁军范围。其他代表于此时均未发言。正在此时，苏代表维辛斯基突起立发问：“试问美英集团中有何国敢赞同在建议中加入报告“武器”两字？”一时形势骤紧，而英代表则忽然起立声明他愿立即接受苏代表的挑战性的建议，坚说当适当的国际监督机构成立时，英国将同意同时报告武器。他乃建议成立一国际监督机构，可应联合国大会或安理会之要求调查实情。莫洛托夫乃起而批评英方新建议“太含混”，但最后表示：可在原则上接受。据合众社记者称：英方之新建议出乎美代表意料之外，美国目前不愿公开原子弹制造秘密。大会于六小时剧烈争论后，决定将英苏两修正案退回小组委员会讨论。
