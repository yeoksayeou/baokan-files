　　Mr. Mao Dun's "Corrosion" has been published by Xinhua Bookstore and is also being typeset by Qingming Publishing House.

　　"Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" is planned to be published as a separate edition and should be available to readers soon.

　　The famous opera "The White-Haired Girl" has sold very well since its publication. To meet the needs of readers, it is now being reprinted. However, because the script has dozens of pages of musical scores, typesetting is more difficult. It is reported that Yongxing Printing Factory is trying to speed up the typesetting.

　　Comrade Zhou Peiran's "Liberation Song Selection" has been published by Xinhua Bookstore. It contains fifty or sixty songs about singing for self-defense, emancipation, and democracy. Comrades who love music, please pay attention to the publication date of the "Song Selection."
