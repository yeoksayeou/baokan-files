　　Chiang Kai-shek's Failed Last Gamble

　　Following closely on the heels of the victory on the Yancheng front, the Su-Wan People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 20,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops north of Suqian from the 15th to the 19th of this month. According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Central China on the 19th, this is an unprecedented great victory for the Su-Wan liberated area, surpassing the previous eleven major victories, and also the greatest victory in the entire patriotic self-defense war since July of this year.

　　This victory of the Su-Wan military and civilians has dealt an extremely serious blow to Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial and civil war plans. Everyone knows that Chiang Kai-shek will not "rest in peace" until he eliminates the Communist Party and the liberated areas, especially the Su-Wan liberated area, which he shouts about daily as "threatening Shanghai and Nanjing" and is determined to seize. In the full-scale civil war since July, he first used 500,000 troops to attack northern Jiangsu. He and Chen Cheng both boasted, "We will eliminate the CCP forces in northern Jiangsu in two months, and resolve the entire CCP militarily in five months." Especially when he convened the so-called "National Assembly," he boasted even more that he would first capture northern Jiangsu as a "gift" to "celebrate" the "National Assembly." Therefore, he concentrated eighteen brigades to attack Yancheng, Funing, Shuyang, and Lianshui areas from the north and south, as a gift-giving team. But what was the result? Not only were the previous eleven battles defeats, with losses of more than 90,000 men, but in this offensive, the 7th Army and the 74th Division of Chiang's army were severely damaged at Dingjiatangfang, losing more than 3,000 men. On the southern front of Yancheng, the 83rd, 65th, and 67th Divisions of Chiang's army were annihilated, losing more than 7,000 men. Subsequently, the 7th Army and the 74th Division were annihilated again near Lianshui, losing more than 2,000 men. Most recently, the New Fourth Army annihilated the entire 57th Division's Pre-3rd Brigade, the 26th Division's 41st Brigade, and the 69th Division's 60th Brigade, as well as parts of the 69th Division's 92nd Brigade, the 276th Division, the 11th Brigade and 18th Brigade of the Reorganized 11th Division, and the entire 5th Engineer Regiment, between the Subei Canal and the Shuyang River. They killed the commander of the 69th Division (formerly the commander of the 99th Army), Dai Zhiqi, captured the deputy commander of the 69th Division, Yao Shaowei, and the commander of the 60th Brigade of the division, Huang Baode. In total, they killed or wounded more than 6,000 Chiang's officers and soldiers, captured more than 16,000 officers and soldiers, and seized 30 mountain guns, 12 field guns, 8 anti-tank guns, more than 50 mortars, 2 Type 92 infantry guns, 3 rocket launchers, 29 60mm mortars, 75 heavy machine guns, more than 500 light machine guns, more than 200 grenade launchers, 19 vehicles, more than 500,000 rounds of various ammunition, and shot down one aircraft. In eight days, a total of more than 17,000 people were captured, more than 6,000 were killed or wounded, and 40 mountain guns and other light and heavy weapons were seized. This is the important gift that Chiang Kai-shek sent to his so-called "National Assembly." Chiang Kai-shek originally wanted to use the military adventure in northern Jiangsu to boost his momentum and stabilize the hearts of the so-called "National Assembly" representatives, but now this attempt has completely failed.

　　The Suqian victory will have a significant impact on the future war situation. It greatly weakened the offensive power of Chiang's army in the Su-Wan area, further demoralized Chiang's army, and thus greatly increased the opportunity for our army to annihilate them. From the perspective of the overall war situation, the People's Liberation Army has begun to shift from passive to active since last month. However, in some local areas, Chiang's army can still concentrate its forces for campaign-level offensives. In this battle of Suqian, Chiang's army concentrated seven brigades on that line. It is particularly worth pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding everything, drew the American-equipped Reorganized 11th Division, a direct line of Chen Cheng, from the Ji-Lu-Yu area, wanting to rely on this trump card as a base to organize a do-or-die offensive against northern Jiangsu. However, in front of the ever-victorious army of Su-Wan, not only were more than half of the invading troops annihilated, but also the main Reorganized 11th Division, on which he relied, abandoned its armor and weapons and was captured alive with more than 600 men. This fact, first, shows that Chiang Kai-shek's lack of troops has become so serious that in order to launch an offensive in this area, he has no choice but to draw stronger forces from areas that have been severely hit, such as Ji-Lu-Yu, to rob Peter to pay Paul, which cannot but give the People's Liberation Army in other areas a good opportunity to launch a counter-offensive. Second, even if Chiang Kai-shek concentrates his forces as much as possible to attack in one area, he will still suffer the same kind of annihilating blow as in the Battle of Suqian. Third, although Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops are generally better equipped and cunning as rats, often using miscellaneous troops as cannon fodder; but as a result, they cannot escape the iron fist of the People's Liberation Army.

　　In order to remedy his shortage of troops and escape the danger of being defeated by our army one by one, Chiang Kai-shek has recently adopted the tactic of advancing side by side with a large number of troops on all battlefields. In this battle of Suqian and Shuyang, they used seven brigades to advance in this formation. However, under the principle of annihilating the enemy's effective strength, the People's Liberation Army is becoming more and more skilled in mobile warfare. The coordinated actions between corps are also becoming more perfect. In this way, Chiang's method of advancing side by side cannot but completely fail. As a result, it lost even more effective strength.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's all-out gamble in northern Jiangsu has been a disastrous failure. Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda machine and its American trumpeters are busy hyping up the capture of Yancheng and Lianshui in order to cover it up. But, first, Chiang Kai-shek has paid a considerable price for taking these two empty cities. From mid-July to the beginning of this month, Chiang Kai-shek used a loss of about 100,000 men in the Su-Wan liberated area to occupy nineteen county towns; that is, the cost of each empty city was about 5,000 people. However, the recent situation is different. Chiang's army lost at least 30,000 men in occupying Yancheng and Lianshui. Second, the vast rural areas surrounding the occupied cities are still controlled by the democratic government and local armed militias. For example, in central Jiangsu, all county towns have been occupied by Chiang's army, but local armed forces and militias can not only persist in defending the vast countryside, but also take the initiative to attack. In the recent half month, more than forty important strongholds of Chiang's army, such as Juegang and Shagou, have been removed, and there are no traces of the enemy in the vast area of 16,000 square miles east of the Fan Gong Dike and north of the Ru (Gao) Jue (Gang) highway. In the Ninth District of Su-Wan, a victorious counter-"encirclement" has been launched, compressing Chiang's army into a few isolated strongholds, whose situation is indeed worse than that of the Japanese invaders before their surrender.

　　The Su-Wan military and civilians have written a glorious epic of victory in every battle. Although Chiang Kai-shek may still make another desperate struggle and invasion on the Su-Wan battlefield despite his serious injuries, the Su-Wan military and civilians, who have been tempered into steel, will not be arrogant or impatient and will continue to give them annihilating blows. The Su-Wan military and civilians' adherence to the battle and new great victories, as well as the increasing shift of our army to the initiative on other battlefields, have proved that the overall war situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable to Chiang Kai-shek. The present and the next few months are the most tense and important turning point in the overall war situation. Let us, all the military and civilians in the liberated areas, fight more intensely and move towards the prospect of victory!

### 蒋介石孤注一掷的失败

　　蒋介石孤注一掷的失败
    紧接着盐城前线之捷，苏皖人民解放军自本月十五日至十九日又在宿迁以北歼灭蒋介石进犯军二万余人。根据新华社华中十九日电，这是苏皖解放区超过以前十一次大捷的空前的大胜利，也是今年七月以来整个爱国自卫战争中空前的大胜利。
    苏皖军民的这一胜利，给了蒋介石的独裁内战计划以极其严重的打击。谁都知道，蒋介石不消灭中共和解放区是“死不瞑目”的，尤其对于苏皖解放区，，他天天喊着它“威胁京沪”，志在必得。七月以来的全面内战，他便首先用了五十万大军向苏北开刀。他和陈诚都夸口说：“两个月内消灭苏北中共军，五个月内在军事上解决整个中共。”特别当他召开所谓“国大”之时，更夸口要首先攻下苏北，作为“庆贺”“国大”的礼物。因此，集中了十八个旅之众，从南北两线猛犯盐、阜、沭、涟等地区，来做送礼队。但是结果怎样呢？不但以前的十一次仗是连战皆败，损失了九万多人。在这次进犯中，蒋军第七军和七十四师在丁家塘房首遭重创，损失三千余人。在盐城南线，蒋军八十三师、六十五师、六十七师又被歼七千余人。随后，第七军和七十四师又在涟水近郊被歼二千余人。直到最近，新四军在宿北运河、沭河之间歼灭了蒋军五十七师预三旅、二十六师之四十一旅和六十九师之六十旅全部，六十九师之九十二旅、二七六师、整十一师之十一旅和十八旅各一部，及工兵第五团全部，击毙指挥官六十九师师长（原九十九军军长）戴之奇，俘获六十九师副师长姚少伟及该师六十旅旅长黄保德，共毙伤蒋军官兵六千余人，俘获官兵一万六千余人，缴获山炮三十门、野炮十二门、战车防御炮八门、迫击炮五十余门、九二式步兵炮二门、火箭炮三门、六○炮二十九门、重机枪七十五挺、轻机枪五百余挺、掷弹筒二百余个、汽车十九辆、各种弹药五十余万发，并击落飞机一架。八日共俘获一万七千余人，毙伤六千余人，缴山炮四十门及其他轻重武器；这就是蒋介石送给其所谓“国大”的重要的礼物。蒋介石原想以苏北的军事冒险来壮壮势头，安定一下那批所谓“国大”代表的心，现在这一企图也彻底破产了。
    宿北大捷对于今后的战局，将产生重大的影响。它大大削弱了苏皖地区的蒋军进攻力量，使蒋军士气更加低沉，因而大大增加了被我军歼灭的机会。从整个战局看，人民解放军从上月份起，已经开始从被动转入主动。但在局部地区，蒋军还能集中兵力作战役性的进攻。此次宿北之役，蒋军在那一线就集中了七个旅，其中特别值得指出的，蒋介石不顾一切的从冀鲁豫地区抽出了陈诚嫡系的美械整十一师，想靠这张王牌做为基干，组织对苏北孤注一掷的攻势。但是在苏皖常胜军前面，不但进犯军半数以上遭歼灭，而且他所倚靠的主力整十一师也弃甲曳兵，被活捕六百余人。这一事实，第一、说明了蒋介石的兵力不足已经严重到这样的程度，为要在这一个地区发动攻势，他已不能不从甚至像冀鲁豫那样痛受打击的地区，抽调较强的兵力来剜肉补疮，这就不能不给别的地区的解放军以展开反攻的好机会。第二、即使蒋介石尽其可能集中兵力在一个地区进攻，仍然会遭受如同宿北之役一样的歼灭打击。第三、蒋介石的嫡系部队虽然一般装备较好，而且狡黠如鼠，常拿杂牌军来当炮灰；但其结果，也逃不了人民解放军的铁拳。
    蒋介石为了补救其兵力不足，逃避被我军各个击破的危险，最近在各战场都采用了以庞大兵力齐头并进的战术。此次宿沭之战，他们就用七个旅按着这阵势推进。然而，人民解放军在歼灭敌人有生力量的方针之下，运动战的手法愈打愈熟练了。兵团与兵团之间的协同动作，也益臻完善了。这样，蒋军齐头并进的方法，就不能不完全失败。结果，反而损失更多的有生力量。
    蒋介石在苏北的孤注一掷是惨败了，蒋介石的宣传机关及其美国的吹鼓手们，为了掩饰起见，正在忙着大吹其对盐城和涟水的攻占。但是，第一、蒋介石为取得这两座空城曾花费了不小的代价。从七月中旬到本月上旬，蒋介石在苏皖解放区用了约十万人的损失，侵占了十九座县城；即平均每一座空城的代价约五千人。然而，近来的情况不同了，蒋军侵占盐城涟水，却先后至少损失了三万多人。第二、被占城市周围的广大农村，依然为民主政府和地方武装民兵所控制。比如在苏中，全部县城已给蒋军侵占，但地方武装和民兵，不但能够坚持保卫广大乡村，而且能主动出击。在最近半月内，拔除了掘港、沙沟等四十多处蒋军重要据点，使范公堤以东、如（皋）掘（港）公路以北一万六千方里的广大地区已无敌踪。而在苏皖九分区，则已展开了胜利的反“清剿”，把蒋军压缩到几个孤零零的据点里面，其处境委实连投降前的日寇还不如。
    苏皖军民已经写了一页百战百胜的光辉史诗，虽然蒋介石还可能不顾重伤在苏皖战场作再次疯狂的挣扎和进犯，但是，百炼成钢的苏皖军民将不骄不馁，继续予以歼灭的打击。苏皖军民坚持战斗和新的伟大胜利，以及其他战场上我军的日益转入主动，已经证明整个战局对蒋介石日益不利。现在和今后几个月，是整个战局最紧张和重大转变的关头，让我们全体解放区军民更紧张的战斗，向胜利前途迈进吧！
