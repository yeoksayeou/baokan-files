　　Allocate Funds to慰劳 the Eighth Route Army
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 18th dispatch] Linqing News: Several national commercial capitalists in Tianjin, after hearing the news of the Eighth Route Army's victories in the JiluYu and other battlefields, were very excited. In order to achieve victory as soon as possible and realize an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China, they specifically sent a letter to the Lihua Factory in Linqing, allocating 100,000 Jichaoin currency to慰劳 the Eighth Route Army at the front. The letter stated: "Chiang Kai-shek's army and government are like wolves, devouring all the small vendors in Tianjin. We are unwilling to watch them swallow us up and hope that the Eighth Route Army will come to liberate us soon." The funds have now been handed over to the Linqing City Patriotic Association for forwarding to the front lines.
