Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th -- The Kuomintang authorities in Jiangsu Province are frantically conscripting soldiers in the Chiang-occupied areas of Nantong, Haimen, and Chongming. More than 4,400 people have already been conscripted, provoking fierce resistance from the local people. A certain Bao in Nantong has conscripted soldiers four times, each time doubling the number. The first time was four people, the second time eight, then sixteen, then thirty-two. Recently, the Nantong County authorities limited each township to contribute 15 to 20 "volunteer soldiers," causing a large number of young people in Nantong to flee to the Liberated Areas. Among them, 100 people even organized a small guerrilla unit to carry out armed struggle. Since October, the Nantong-Rugao line guerrilla隊 has advanced into the streets of Dingyan, Linzi, and other Chiang-occupied strongholds to carry out soldier protection struggles, destroying dozens of dams on six major roads in the north and west of Dingyan. They would beat the "Homecoming Legion," who helped create conscription registers, scaring them into inaction. In the Chiang-occupied area of Haimen, a "Demand Husband, Demand Son" movement broke out. On October 16th, at two households in the northeast one li and northwest two li of Haimen City, because relatives and neighbors gathered in large numbers for a funeral, the Chiang district office learned of this and sent "Self-Defense Forces" to capture soldiers. This immediately aroused resistance from the entire crowd. Later, a police team was called in to suppress them, and more than 200 young people were all arrested. Immediately, the old men, women, and children cried loudly, their situation extremely miserable. The next day, more than 200 family members spontaneously gathered, holding bamboo poles and white cloth banners, and rushed to the Chiang County government near the county yamen, braving the machine guns and bayonets of the Chiang army. They banged on the alley gates, crying and shouting, "Return our sons!" "Return our husbands!" "Return our brothers!" The conscripted soldiers who were locked inside also cried out in unison. Those who saw it could not help but feel sad and shed tears, which doubled their hatred for the Chiang authorities. It was not until dark that the more than 200 old, weak, women, and children returned. A widespread "Demand Husband, Demand Son" movement is brewing and developing in various places.

    【新华社华中十六日电】江苏国民党当局在南通、海门、崇明蒋占区内大肆抽抓壮丁，已被抽捉去四千四百余名，激起该地人民剧烈反抗。南通某保先后抽丁四次，每次逐倍增加，第一次四人，第二次八人，而十六人而三十二人。近南通县当局，又限每乡摊派十五至二十名“志愿兵”，致南通大批青年逃向解放区，其中有一百人且组织小游击队，进行武装斗争。南通、如皋线游击队自十月起，更挺进丁堰、林梓等蒋占据点街头，进行保丁斗争，将丁堰北西二面六条大路数十个坝头，悉数破坏，对帮造壮丁册子的“还乡团”则一动就打，吓得他们不动。海门蒋占区且爆发“索夫索子”运动。十月十六日海门城东北一里及西北二里的两户人家，因治丧亲邻聚合甚众，蒋区公所得悉，即派“自卫队”分往捕捉壮丁，当引起全场反抗，后又调来警察队镇压，二百余青年全被抓去，顿时老头、妇孺大喊大哭，状极凄惨。翌日各家属二百余人自发集合，手持竹竿上扯白布赶到蒋县府附近，冒蒋军机枪刺刀向县衙猛冲，敲打巷门，带哭带喊，“还我们儿子”、“还我们丈夫”、“还我们阿哥阿弟”，被关在里面的壮丁，也同声大哭，见者莫不心酸泪下，倍增对蒋当局痛恨，直到天黑二百余老弱妇孺始回。普遍的“索夫索子”运动，正在各地酝酿发展中。
