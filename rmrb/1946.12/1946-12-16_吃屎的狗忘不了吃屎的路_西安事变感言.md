　　A Dog That Eats Dung Can't Forget the Dung-Eating Path
    ——Reflections on the Xi'an Incident——
    Li Furen
    Everyone unanimously acknowledges that the Xi'an Incident was when Generals Zhang and Yang, in the face of the nationwide surge for national salvation, grabbed Chiang Kai-shek by the ears and forced him to "resist Japan and save the nation." The Xi'an Incident was indeed a historical masterpiece that turned the tide, but the protagonists of this masterpiece, Generals Zhang and Yang, have been imprisoned for ten years and have yet to be released.

    On the day of the Xi'an Incident, I was working in the education sector in Xi'an. At that time, I saw the situation deteriorating day by day, and I couldn't help but "sweat a bit" for the people of Xi'an and the folks in the Guanzhong area. However, I still favored staging a "capture and release of Cao Cao" for old Chiang. But over the past ten years, old Chiang's actions have increasingly increased my loathing for him. Since he directed his secret agents to openly hijack people in broad daylight and shot me twice, I have become even more aware of Chiang Kai-shek's sinister and vicious schemes.

    The philosophy of the common people sees clearly: "Things happen when they are forced by extreme circumstances." The people across the country wanted to resist Japan. Two days before the incident, male and female students in Xi'an petitioned General Zhang Xueliang, with patriotic students weeping and begging him to withdraw from the civil war and immediately resist Japan to save the nation. General Zhang's soldiers had long proposed returning to their hometowns, saying, "It is better to be a stray dog than a person without a country." The mass movement reached its peak, and no one could stop it.

    At that time, old Chiang was holding a military conference in Luoyang, wearing a cloak and a mouthful of dentures, looking quite imposing. During the eight-sided meeting, he also came to Lintong to bathe, spying on Zhang and Yang's movements, being extremely cunning. Who knew that on the twelfth of December, just before dawn, a shot rang out, and old Chiang jumped out of the warm bed of golden dragon satin, running to the side of the tiger rock, unable to say a word, only hearing air escaping from his mouth. It turned out that his mouthful of dentures had fallen on the bedside, and his cloak was already draped over a soldier. From getting into the car to returning to the new city of Xi'an, he didn't dare to say a word for most of the day. Everyone should know that the news spread from the soldiers who arrested old Chiang was much more truthful than what he himself wrote in "Half a Month Record of the Xi'an Incident."

    General Zhang was responsible for arresting old Chiang, and General Yang was responsible for the defense of Xi'an. In one fell swoop, they detained twenty-eight civil war experts. Chen Cheng, a running dog general of Chiang's, was pulled out of the sewer, and his "replies were like dropping beans" (meaning the replier was begging for mercy, and the "dropping beans" meant constantly calling out "grandpa" and "father"). In the past, Dou Xiu scolded Liang Zhongshu as "a lackey's lackey." Chiang Kai-shek is a lackey of foreign aggressors, and Chen Cheng naturally became Chiang Kai-shek's lackey.

    As the saying goes, "When things reach a desperate point, there will be a miracle." The pro-Japanese He Yingqin ordered the suppression of Zhang and Yang, hoping that they would fight a major battle so that Japan could profit from it and swallow China. Thanks to the Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai, who disregarded past grievances and mediated, persuading Zhang and Yang to release Chiang Kai-shek and unite to resist Japan, the situation was reversed, ending ten years of civil war and launching the sacred war of resistance.

    However, Chiang Kai-shek repaid kindness with enmity. He was passive in his efforts to fight Japan during the war, and after the war, he launched a major civil war, convened an illegal National Assembly, and willingly became the son-emperor of American imperialism. Therefore, the common people all say, "A dog that eats dung can't forget the dung-eating path."

　　吃屎的狗忘不了吃屎的路
    ——西安事变感言——
    李敷仁
    大家一致都承认西安事变是张杨二将军在全中国人民救亡怒潮前面，扯住蒋介石的耳朵硬是叫他“抗日救国”。西安事变的确是扭转乾坤的历史杰作，但是这一杰作的主角张杨两将军，十载监牢至今还未释放。
    西安事变那一日，鄙人身在西安教育界工作，那时鄙人眼见局势日益恶化，未免也替西安人民和关中老百姓“握了一把儿的汗”，但是对于老蒋却还赞成唱一出“捉放曹”，可是十年以来老蒋的行径日益增加我的憎恶，自从他指挥他的特务白昼驱车公开劫人打了我两枪以后，我更知道蒋介石的阴谋狠毒。
    老百姓的哲学看得清楚“事出逼煎皇”，全国老百姓都要抗日。事变前两天，西安男女学生向张学良将军请愿，爱国学生痛哭流涕叫他退出内战，立即抗日救国。张将军的士兵早已提出打回老家去，他们说：“亡国之人不如丧家之狗”。群众运动达到顶点，泰山压顶谁也挡他不住的。
    那时老蒋在洛阳开军事会议，身披斗蓬，满口假牙好不威风。八面会议中又来临潼洗澡，窥探张杨动静，好不鬼计多端，谁知十二月十二日那天快要破晓的时候，一声枪响，老蒋从金龙闪缎的温暖被窝中，一咕喽爬起来就逃跑到虎畔石旁，说不出一句话来，只听得口中放气，原来满口假牙掉在床头，一身斗蓬早已披在士兵身上了。从装上汽车到回到西安新城，大半天一句话不敢说出。列位要知从逮捕老蒋的士兵口中传出的消息，比他自己写在“西安事变半月记”上的话头真得多了。
    张将军担任逮捕老蒋，杨将军担任西安城防，一家伙扣住二十八位内战专家，师长以上的蒋记走狗将官陈诚从水道里被拉出来，“回话像丢豆儿一样”（回话者求饶之意，丢豆者叫爷叫爹不断之意）昔者豆秀骂梁中书“奴才的奴才”，老蒋是外国侵略者的奴才，陈诚自然就成了老蒋的奴才了。
    常言道“事到十急处，便有个出奇事”，亲日派何应钦下令讨伐张、杨，日本人希望他大打从中取利，鲸吞中国，多亏共产党代表周恩来不计旧怨，从中斡旋，劝张、杨释放蒋介石团结抗战结果，旋乾转坤结束了十年内战，开展了神圣抗战。
    但是蒋介石以怨报德，他在抗战中消极怠工，抗战一完，大打内战，召开非法国大，甘当美国帝国主义的儿皇帝，于是老百姓都说“吃屎的狗忘不了吃屎的路”。
