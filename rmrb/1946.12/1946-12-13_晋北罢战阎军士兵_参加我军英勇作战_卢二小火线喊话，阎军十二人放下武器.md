    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 10th. Yan Army soldiers who laid down their weapons in the Northern Shanxi Self-Defense Campaign voluntarily joined the Eighth Route Army and demonstrated extraordinary bravery on the battlefield. In the Yuanping battle, Wang Changyun, a soldier from the fifth squad of a certain company (formerly a soldier in the 69th Division of the Yan Army), crossed a 100-meter open area under the dense fire of the Yan Army, removing landmines near the Yan Army's碉堡 (碉堡:blockhouse/pillbox), allowing subsequent troops to successfully enter the blockhouse. He was commended at the military personnel meeting. Zhang Liang, a newly liberated Yan Army soldier from the seventh company, automatically joined the commando during a battle and was the first to rush onto the courtyard wall, using grenades to force the Yan Army soldiers who had climbed onto the roof into the house, capturing twelve Yan soldiers alive. Zhang Liang was subsequently promoted to deputy squad leader. During the Fenyangling battle, a group of defeated soldiers from the Yan Army's 69th Division stubbornly resisted based on the terrain. Lu Erxiao, a Yan Army soldier who had surrendered to a certain company of the Eighth Route Army, used his own example to make an on-the-spot appeal, and twelve Yan Army soldiers voluntarily laid down their weapons.

    参加我军英勇作战
    卢二小火线喊话，阎军十二人放下武器
    【新华社晋绥十日电】晋北自卫战役中放下武器之阎军士兵，自愿参加八路军，在战场上表现异常英勇。原平战斗中某连五班战士王长云（原阎军六十九师士兵）在阎军密集火网下，越过长达百余米之开阔地带，拔除了阎军碉堡附近之地雷，使后续部队顺利攻入堡内。在军人大会上受到表扬。七连新解放之阎军士兵张亮，于一次战斗时自动参加突击队，首先冲上院墙，用手榴弹将爬上房顶之阎军逼入房中，生俘阎军十二人。张亮随即被提升为副班长。汾阳岭战斗中阎军六十九师溃兵一股，依据地形顽抗，投诚八路军某连之阎军战士卢二小以自身为例，进行火线喊话，阎军十二名遂自动放下武器。
