　　Wang Keqin Model Platoon
　　Ran Hong, Mao Yongru
　　Machine gunner Wang Keqin was liberated from the Ping-Han Campaign last year. After the Dayang Lake battle, he was promoted to deputy squad leader, and soon after to squad leader. Now he is the deputy platoon leader of the 6052nd unit.
　　He is 26 years old this year. Six years ago, he was conscripted into the Kuomintang's 30th Army in his hometown in Anhui and fought against the New Fourth Army in northern Hubei. After being captured, he was released. A few days as a prisoner of war made him realize the benefits of the people's army. Later, he was forced to participate in the Ping-Han Campaign. Unwilling to shoot his own brothers, he pretended to have a stomachache and stayed behind. When the 30th Army was completely annihilated, he was captured for the second time and firmly requested to join the Eighth Route Army. When he saw the people in the liberated areas living a free and prosperous life, he thought, "How wonderful it would be if my hometown could also let the poor stand up!" Through the speaking bitterness campaign, his awareness improved rapidly.
　　(1) Wang Keqin's Leadership Method
　　When the 6052nd unit summarized the Xuzhuang battle, from the squad and platoon to the regiment, they all believed that Wang Keqin's squad in the First Company combined the vigorous fighting spirit with military skills and command the best, and was the most effective in leading new soldiers to fight.
　　After the Battle of Dayang Lake, the squad was supplemented with four new soldiers. Comrade Wang Keqin thought, "To fight well, we must first teach the new soldiers well. Teach them more in peacetime, and it will be easier in wartime." Because he was skilled and taught effectively (teaching while demonstrating), the soldiers learned with great interest, saying, "Our squad leader is capable, we can't fall behind." Everyone studied hard day and night. In less than a month, they became so familiar with their one Bren gun and one Type 11 light machine gun that they could quickly disassemble and reassemble the parts with their eyes closed. They learned shooting, grenade throwing, digging fortifications, and using terrain and features.
　　The mutual aid group was a powerful assistant in his command. He instructed the mutual aid group leaders to keep control of their group members no matter how fierce the enemy fire was, to watch the squad leader when advancing, and to keep a distance of three steps between each person.
　　Wang Keqin, to show his determination to sacrifice, designated the deputy squad leader as the first agent and the first mutual aid group leader as the second agent. In this way, before going to the battlefield, everyone had a relatively adequate ideological preparation. Once, bullets fired by the enemy from Liuzhuang whistled in the air above the advancing road. Thanks to the connection and supervision of the mutual aid group, the three-mile-long night run did not lose distance and was also very quiet.
　　He explained the situation to the new comrades at any time. For example, when he saw a village ahead brightly lit during the advance, he would say, "That's the enemy. They are lighting a big fire because they are afraid of us." On the position, when the enemy came up wearing helmets and holding bayonets, he would say, "The enemy is coming, everyone stay calm, wait until they get close, and throw grenades." When he saw the enemy wearing white clothes, the soldiers felt strange, and he said, "That's to contact the aircraft, indicating that the infantry has advanced there." The new soldiers understood in their hearts and were no longer afraid.
　　(2) Skilled and Flexible in Commanding Combat
　　When advancing on the position, he clearly pointed out the position: advance to there, the first person to there, how to use the terrain, the second person...; when retreating, it was the same. In combat, he was always clear and organized.
　　Entering battle, he explained to everyone: "As long as you are calm and don't move, and hide well in the fortifications, artillery and aircraft can't hurt you, unless they happen to hit your fortifications. We must concentrate on the enemy's infantry." He also said, "The closer you are to the enemy, the less dangerous it is, and our bayonets and grenades can play a greater role." Once, when the enemy's artillery fire was tight, the squad leader was firing a machine gun in front, and three soldiers were observing the enemy behind him, a dozen meters away behind a wheat straw stack. A shell exploded nearby, and the dirt clods hit Yang Xuebao and Zhao Qingnian's faces, turning them blue. They wanted to run. The squad leader immediately called out, "Don't move. As long as you don't move, the enemy won't find the target, and the shells won't fall in the same place." They didn't move. Another shell broke a foot-thick tree next to the straw stack, and the branches and leaves buried Bai Zhixue, who was lying under the tree. He also listened to the squad leader and didn't move. Then the shells landed far away.
　　(3) Heroic in Combat and Caring for the Masses
　　Comrade Wang Keqin was guarding a bunker (at this time, the three people in his first mutual aid group were hiding in the house behind), and a shell came towards the firing port. He pulled the machine gun back, and just stepped out of the door when the shell exploded. He moved to a wall and dug several firing ports at once. After firing a few bursts at the first firing port, the shell immediately hit the first firing port when he turned to the second one. Relying on his skillful maneuverability, he persisted in using firepower to kill and wound the enemy. His machine gun was moved back and forth several times.
　　The second mutual aid group, led by the group leader, independently defended the position until dark, repelling several enemy attacks.
　　The battle ended, and the entire squad was assembled without any casualties.
　　When we went to visit their squad, Squad Leader Wang boasted, "In the Kuomintang army, soldiers trained for two years may not be able to fight. Our new soldiers in one month are stronger than them in two years."
　　"Which of your new comrades fought the most heroically this time?" "They were all heroic, none of them lagged behind." The whole squad answered with great enthusiasm. The squad leader pondered for a moment and said, "Bai Zhixue was the best." Everyone then started telling Bai Zhixue's story: "He threw the most and farthest grenades, hitting the enemy and making them scream from across two houses more than ten feet high. The most outstanding thing was the story of him rescuing the old lady on the front line: an enemy shell collapsed the house of an old lady in the village and injured her. She cried to the sky. Bai Zhixue ran over and carried her to a safe place. She was worried about her things at home, so Bai Zhixue moved the flour jar and rice container over for her to guard."
　　A month ago, after the Battle of Dayang Lake, the troops were stationed in Chen Village. It was raining, and the landlord's old lady's sorghum was being soaked in the field. They covered it with sorghum stalks and carried a full jar of sweet water for her. The old lady was very grateful and sent them off very far. She told them, "Remember this place is called Chen Village, come back and stay at my house again."
　　(4) The Core of Uniting the Masses
　　When Bai Zhixue first came, he was homesick and not very enthusiastic. Other comrades persuaded him, "If you don't work hard, how can you be worthy of the squad leader?" That one sentence changed him, and he became active. Why did they respect the squad leader so much? New comrade Yang Xuebao said, "When we first came, the quilts had not been distributed yet, and the squad leader was afraid that we would be cold, so he got us covers every night, taking out his own sheets. Once, in the dark night, it rained heavily, and we marched sixty or seventy li, crossing more than ten li of water. The new comrades let the old comrades carry their things. Bai Zhixue fell ill, and the squad leader took care of him, forgetting to eat his own meals. The squad leader chatted with everyone every night, opening their minds. The comrades were all very affectionate, and everyone competed to do public errands, even better than at home." Lu Shoukun also said, "The squad leader is not only good to people, but also very capable. Following him to fight, we are not afraid of danger, and we feel very confident, as if we have a good housekeeper."＊

　　王克勤模范班
    冉虹　毛雍如
    机枪射手王克勤是去年平汉战役解放过来的，大杨湖战后，提升为副班长，不久又升班长，现在是六○五二部队的副排长。
    他今年二十六岁，六年前在安徽老家被抓到国民党三十军当兵，到鄂北打新四军，被俘后又放回去了。几天的俘虏生活，使他认识了人民军队的好处。后来又被迫参加平汉战役，他不愿再昧着良心射击自己弟兄，装肚子痛缩在后边。三十军全军覆没时他第二次被俘，坚决要求参加八路军。当他见到解放区人民过着自由富裕的生活时，他想：“要是我的家乡也能让穷人翻翻身多好啊！”经过诉苦运动，他的觉悟飞速提高。 　 （一）王克勤的领导方法
    六○五二部队总结徐庄战斗时，从班排到团，都认为第一连王克勤班把旺盛的战斗情绪和军事技术及指挥结合得最好，带领新战士作战最有办法。
    打罢大杨湖，班里补充了四个新战士，王克勤同志想：“要能打好仗，首先要教好新战士，平时多教，战时省力些”。由于他技术熟练和教的得法（边教边比划），战士们学的很有味道，都说：“咱班长能干，咱们也不能落后。”大家都白天黑夜赶紧学。不到一个月，对他们的一挺转盘、一挺歪把摸得这样熟练，蒙着眼睛能迅速把零件拆卸又装好。射击、投弹、挖工事和利用地形地物都学会了。
    互助组是他指挥上的有力助手。他嘱咐互助组长不管敌火怎样猛烈，要掌握住组里的人，前进时看着班长，一个跟一个，保持三步距离。
    王克勤为表明牺牲决心，指定副班长做第一代理人，第一互助组长做第二代理人。这样，在临上战场前，大家思想上都有了比较充分的准备。有一次敌人从刘庄打来的子弹在前进道路的上空呼啸，由于互助组的联系督促，三里长的黑夜跑步没拉距离，也很肃静。
    他随时给新同志解释情况。比如在前进中看见前面村子通明，就说：“那是敌人。因为怕我们，所以烧着大火。”在阵地上，敌人戴着钢盔端着刺刀上来了，他就说：“敌人来了，大家沉住气，等走近了，用手榴弹扔。”看见敌人穿白衣，战士觉得奇怪，他就说：“那是和飞机联络，表示步兵进到那里的。”新战士心里明白，就不害怕了。
    （二）指挥作战技术熟练机动灵活
    在阵地上前进的时候，他很明确地指出位置：前进到那里，第一名到那里，怎样利用地形，第二名………；下来时，也这样。在作战中始终一点不乱。
    进入战斗，他向大家解说：“只要沉着不乱动，在工事里隐蔽好，大炮飞机伤不了人，除非恰巧打到你的工事里。我们要集中注意敌人的步兵。”他又说：“越接近敌人，危险越小，我们的刺刀、手榴弹越能发挥作用。”有一次，敌人炮火正打得紧密，班长在前面打着机枪，三个战士在他后面十几米远的麦秸垛后面观察敌人。一颗炮弹在跟前爆炸了，掀起土块把杨学宝、赵青年的脸打青了，他两人想跑。班长马上招呼：“不要动，只要不动，敌人发现不了目标，炮弹就不会往原地落。”他俩就没动。又一炮把麦垛旁边尺来粗的树打断了，枝叶埋住了卧在树下的白志学，他也听班长的话没动。接着炮弹就落得远了。
  　（三）作战英勇爱护群众
    王克勤同志守着一个地堡（这时他带的第一互助组里的三个人在后面房子里隐蔽着），一颗炮弹向枪眼打来，他拉着机枪往后一扯，刚跨出门外，炮弹炸了。他转移到一座围墙里，一下挖了几个枪眼，在第一个枪眼打了几梭子，刚转到第二个，炮弹马上打到第一个枪眼。靠他的熟练机动，坚持火力杀伤敌人。他这挺机枪被调来调去好几次。
    第二互助组由组长带着单独坚守阵地，直到天黑，打退敌人好几次冲锋。
    战斗结束了，集合全班，毫无损伤。
    当我们到他们班去访问的时候，王班长夸耀地说：“在国民党军队里，训练两年的士兵，恐怕也未必能打。我们一个月的新战士，比他们两年的还强。”
    “这次你们新同志谁打的最英勇？”“都英勇，谁也不落后。”全班兴头十足地回答。班长沉思了一下，说：“白志学最好。”大家就扯起白志学的故事来：“打的手榴弹最多最远，隔着两座丈多高的房子投弹，打得敌人乱叫。最出色的是他在火线上抢救老太太的故事：敌人一颗炮弹把庄里一个老太太的房子打垮，把她砸伤，她仰天大哭。白志学跑过去把她背到安全地方，她不放心家里的东西，白志学又把面坛米罐搬过去让她守着。
    一个月前，打罢大杨湖，队伍在陈庄驻下，天下着雨，房东老太太的高粱在地里淋着，他们用秫秸给盖好，又给她担了满缸甜水，老太太很感激，临走送给他们十个鸡蛋，二百元钱。他们不要，老太太送他们送得很远。嘱咐他们：“记住这儿叫个陈庄，下回来了，再住我家。”
　  （四）团结群众的核心
    白志学初来时有些想家，不起劲，别的同志规劝他：“不好好干，对得起人家班长么？”就这样一句话劝转了他，他积极起来了。他们为什么那样尊敬班长？新同志杨学宝说：“我们初来时，被子还没有发下，班长怕我们冻着，天天夜里给弄盖的，抽出自己的单子。有次，黑夜大雨，行军六七十里，过了十多里水，新同志东西尽教老同志拿着。白志学害病，班长照护他，忘了自己吃饭。班长每晚和大家闲扯，开心窍。同志们都亲亲热热，公差勤务大家争着干，比家里还好。”卢守琨也说：“班长不单是待人好，又很能干，跟着他打仗不怕危险，心里怪有主张，好像有了个好当家的一样。”＊
