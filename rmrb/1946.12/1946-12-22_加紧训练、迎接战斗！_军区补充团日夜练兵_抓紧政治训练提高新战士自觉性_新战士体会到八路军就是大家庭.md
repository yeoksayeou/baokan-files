[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] After receiving Deputy Commander Teng’s instruction on the 30th of last month to “intensify training and prepare for battle,” the Military Region Reinforcement Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Ren, immediately conducted thorough mobilization, stipulating that companies should construct training grounds, wooden horses, horizontal bars, straw targets, trenches, single-plank bridges, broken walls, barbed wire, and other training facilities. Each soldier prepared a one-jin wooden hand grenade. From then on, the sounds of commands and grenade throwing could be heard every dawn, and the entire garrison was immersed in a combat atmosphere. They built obstacles like single-plank bridges between the barracks and the dining hall, as well as classrooms, so that all officers and soldiers could practice obstacle crossing effectively during meals and lessons. All levels of commanders were no exception, performing the “drop down” action; Regiment Commander Ren was also covered in dust like everyone else. The new soldiers were very moved and said, "Even the regimental commander and instructor are working hard to practice; if we don't study hard, we shouldn't!" New soldier Ma Fusuo from the Eighth Company was sick, and the instructor advised him to rest, but he refused, saying, "What if I delay my studies? If I don't learn the skills well, I won't be able to fight well!" During game time, the new soldiers still picked up their shiny bayonets with great energy and practiced bayonet fighting. In just over a week, the average grenade throwing record has been raised from 37 meters to 46 meters, and soldier Zhang Yongsai from the Seventh Company and others won awards for being grenade-throwing models. Night exercises have achieved the ability to pass through the village liaison lines without seeing any fire or hearing any sound. Other basic movements such as shooting have also achieved an accuracy rate of sixty to seventy percent.

[Another Dispatch] The reason why the Military Region Reinforcement Regiment achieved excellent results in the first week of the training campaign is that, in addition to thorough mobilization and the exemplary role of cadres, they mainly focused on political training, which greatly enhanced the new soldiers' awareness. At the beginning of the training, the regimental political department issued the call to "strive to be model workers, model learners, and model squads, platoons, and companies." The political education procedure is as follows: First, clarify that joining the Eighth Route Army is not "to die" but "to survive," and use the ratio of enemy-to-friendly casualties on the self-defense battlefield to illustrate that we do not die easily. The second is to establish the idea of "sons and daughters of the people;" more than 80 percent of our soldiers are children of peasants who have been liberated. Our opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's selling-out of the country and civil war and going to the front lines is also to protect the people's land and houses, and to defend our victory in emancipation. Achieve the educational policy of "not being afraid of death, not missing home, eliminating peaceful illusions, and strengthening confidence in victory." In just over ten days, many new soldiers have begun to realize in their studies that the Eighth Route Army is a big family, and that officers and soldiers are like parents and brothers in the family, gradually eliminating the feudal sentiments brought by the soldiers from the countryside, and revolutionary sentiments are budding. New soldiers in the first platoon of the Fourth Company automatically wrote letters home to comfort their parents and wives, telling them that they were doing well in the reinforcement regiment and telling them not to worry for the time being. In this revolutionary family, the fine tradition of farmers' love of labor is greatly promoted, building various training facilities themselves, and carrying grain and coal themselves. The whole regiment cut 110,024 jin of thatch in one day, saving 440,096 yuan in coal. The relationship between the reinforcement regiment and the local villagers is also very harmonious. The soldiers automatically fetch water and carry manure for the villagers, and the masses support them very much, and they often hold military-civilian gatherings. (Nanfei)

　　加紧训练、迎接战斗！
    军区补充团日夜练兵
    抓紧政治训练提高新战士自觉性
    新战士体会到八路军就是大家庭
    【本报特讯】军区补充团任团长，上月三十日接受滕副司令员“加紧训练，迎接战斗”的指示后，即进行深入动员，规定以连为单位修筑操场、木马、单杠、草靶、壕沟、独木桥、断墙、铁丝网等练兵设备。每个战士都作好一个一斤重的木质手榴弹。从此，每天黎明就可听到口令与投弹声音，整个驻地浸沉在战斗气氛里。他们将独木桥等障碍建筑在营房与饭厅、课堂之间，使全体将士吃饭和上课时就能收到练习通过障碍的实效。各级指挥员也毫无例外，一个“卧下”，动作起来，任团长也和大家一样满身尘土。新战士很受感动的说：“人家团长、指导员都努力练习，咱还不好好学就不应该了！”八连新战士马福锁害病了，指导员劝他歇歇，他都不肯，他说：“耽误了学习怎办？学不好本事就打不好仗呀！”游戏时间里，新战士们仍精神百倍地端起雪亮的枪刺在练刺杀。一个多礼拜来，平均投弹纪录已由三十七米提高到四十六米，七连战士张永赛等荣获投弹模范的奖励。夜间演习已做到不见烟火、不动声响地通过各村连络线。其他如射击等各种基本动作也做到了十之六、七的准确程度。
    【另讯】军区补充团第一周练兵运动之所以取得优异的成绩，除动员深入与干部的模范作用外，主要是抓紧了政治训练，大大提高了新战士的自觉性。练兵开始，团政治处即发出“争取做模范工作者，模范学习者与模范班、排、连”的号召。政治教育程序是：首先明确参加八路军不是“要死”而是“求活”，以自卫战场敌、我伤亡比例来说明我们的不轻易死亡。其次是树立“人民子弟兵”思想，我们的战士百分之八十以上是翻身了的农民子弟。我们反对蒋介石卖国内战而上前线，也就是保护人民的土地房屋，保卫自己的翻身胜利果实。达到“不怕死、不想家、肃清和平幻想、坚定胜利信心”的教育方针。短短的十几天功夫，许多新战士在学习中已开始体会到八路军就是个大家庭，官兵之间就如家里的家长弟兄一样，逐渐消除了战士们从农村带来的封建感情，萌芽了革命感情。四连一排新战士，自动写信回家安慰父母妻子，告诉在补充团很好，叫他们暂且不要挂念。在这个革命大家庭里，农民那种爱劳动的优良传统大大的被发扬着，自己动手建设各种练兵设备，自己搬运粮炭。全团一天割毛草十一万零廿四斤，省下炭洋四十四万零九十六元。补充团与驻地老乡关系也十分融洽，战士自动给老乡挑水、担粪，群众非常拥护他们，并常开军民联欢会。（南飞）
