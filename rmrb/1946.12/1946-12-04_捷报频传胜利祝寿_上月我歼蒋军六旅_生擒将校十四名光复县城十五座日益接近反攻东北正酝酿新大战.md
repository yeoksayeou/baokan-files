　　Frequent News of Victory Celebrates Birthday
  　Last Month Our Troops Annihilated Six Brigades of Chiang's Army
  　Captured 14 Generals and Colonels Alive; Recovered 15 County Towns; Approaching Counter-Offensive in Northeast; New Major Battles Brewing
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. As we celebrate Commander-in-Chief Zhu's 60th birthday, frequent news of victory arrives from the frontlines of self-defense. After recovering Yonghe and Daning, the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army successively liberated the three cities of Puxian, Xixian, and Shilou on the 27th and 28th, capturing alive more than 2,000 Yan Army soldiers, including Yang Chengyuan, a lieutenant general and commander-in-chief of the Jinxi region (formerly commander of the 34th Army). Thus, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin-Sui, and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu liberated areas are connected as one, greatly reducing the threat to the eastern side of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia. This is a major blow to Chiang Kai-shek's preparations to attack the democratic holy land of Yan'an. However, there have been skirmishes on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border this week. On the morning of the 26th, a unit of Hu Zongnan's troops attacked the area south of @ County but were repelled by the Eighth Route Army. Our border region soldiers and civilians are stepping up preparations for war. If Chiang's army dares to launch a large-scale attack on the border region, it will surely be completely and thoroughly annihilated.
    Simultaneous with the great victory in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu border region and the Puyang-Huaxian area, our local armed forces recovered @ City in one fell swoop. On the front lines of Ji-Lu-Yu, two kinds of Chiang Kai-shek's secret orders were seized, stating: "Areas occupied after the ceasefire order must not be announced." This proves even more that Chiang Kai-shek's ceasefire order is actually a tactic for large-scale fighting. In the Northeast, the Democratic Allied Army has repeatedly achieved victories. A total of nearly a thousand invading Chiang's troops were killed, wounded, or captured in the east, west, south, and north. In the battle of Kaoshantun, southwest of Harbin, more than 800 bandits incorporated into Chiang's army were also eliminated. Recently, warmonger Du Yuming received "confidential" instructions in Nanjing and hurriedly flew back to the Northeast, possibly to launch another large-scale offensive. Our Northeast soldiers and civilians will surely inflict a devastating blow on them.
    This week, our troops annihilated 6,000 enemy soldiers across the entire front. In the month of November alone, more than 60,000 Chiang's troops were eliminated. Our army's strategic counter-offensive is approaching.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. The Yan'an Headquarters has just released the results of the self-defense battles in November as follows:
    According to the materials obtained, there were a total of 647 large and small battles. More than 310,000 regular Chiang's troops participated in the fighting.

The units involved were the entire 104th Brigade of the 41st Division, most of the 125th Brigade of the 47th Division, one regiment each from the 39th Brigade and the 106th Brigade of the 40th Division, and more than two companies from the 49th Brigade of the 27th Division, totaling two brigades in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area.

In the Central China area, small parts of the 51st Brigade and the 58th Brigade of the 74th Division and the 28th Division, totaling two battalions, and parts of the 171st Division and the 172nd Division of the 1st Army, totaling one and a half regiments, and one battalion of the 57th Division (formerly the 98th Army), totaling two and a half regiments. In the Jin-Sui area, the entire 3rd Provisional Division of the 39th Provisional Division of the 43rd Army, and most of the 3rd Regiment of the 40th Provisional Division of the 19th Army, totaling one and a half regiments. In the Jin-Cha-Ji-Re-Liao area, part of the 13th Regiment of the 5th Division of the 94th Army, parts of the 116th Division and the 130th Division of the 53rd Army, and two battalions of the 101st Division of the 35th Army, totaling one and a half regiments. A total of 12,258 local security teams and puppet troops of Chiang were eliminated, including 2,967 wounded, 1,660 killed, and 7,571 captured. In total, 30,229 Chiang's and puppet troops were killed or wounded, and 30,227 were captured. Fourteen generals and colonels, including Yang Xianming, commander of the 104th Brigade, Li Keyuan, deputy commander, Li Zhengyi, commander of the 25th Division, Duan Peide, deputy commander, and regimental commanders Huang Deliang, Feng Yingchang, and Zhao Zhengguo, were captured alive.

    Chiang's army occupied sixteen counties including Guangling, Kangbao, Xinming, Wutai, Dingxiang, Guyuan, Xushui, Wangdu, Weixian, Lulong, Yexian, Anqiu, Gaoyuan, Qidong, Kuandian, and Tonghua. Our army recovered fifteen county towns including Mancheng, @ City, Pingdu, Qidong, Shouguang, Huantai, Changyi, Jiyuan, Huai'ren, Daning, Yonghe, Puxian, Xixian, and Shilou.

　　捷报频传胜利祝寿
  　上月我歼蒋军六旅
  　生擒将校十四名光复县城十五座日益接近反攻东北正酝酿新大战
    【新华社延安一日电】在祝朱总司令六十大寿时，自卫前线的捷报频传，晋绥八路军于收复永和大宁后，又于二十七、二十八两日相继解放蒲县、隰县、石楼三城，并生俘阎军晋西总指挥杨澄源上将（原三十四军军长）以下两千余人。至此陕甘宁、晋绥、晋冀鲁豫三个解放区联成一片，并大大减轻陕甘宁东面威胁。这对蒋介石准备进攻民主圣地延安，给了一个很大的打击。但陕甘宁边境本周来仍有前哨战，胡宗南一部于二十六日晨袭击＠县以南一带，为八路军击退。我边区军民正加紧备战，蒋军如胆敢大举进攻边区，则必予以彻底干脆的歼灭。
    在晋冀鲁豫边区与濮（阳）滑（县）大捷同时，我地方武装一举收复＠城。在冀鲁豫前线缴获了蒋介石的密令两种内称：“在停战令以后所占地区，不得发表。”这更可证明蒋介石的停战令，正是大打的作法。东北方面民主联军迭获胜利，×东西南共毙伤俘进犯蒋军近千人，哈尔滨西南靠山屯之役，蒋军收编的匪部八百余人亦被消灭。最近好战分子杜聿明在南京面受“机密”后，匆匆飞返东北，可能再次发动新的大规模进攻，我东北军民必将予以歼灭性打击。
    本周来全线我军歼敌六千人。十一月一个月内共消灭蒋军六万余人，我军战略反攻已日益接近。
    【新华社延安一日电】延安总部顷发表十一月份自卫战绩如下：
    据已获得材料共大小战斗六四七次，蒋军参加作战的正规军三十一万余人，被我歼灭之蒋正规军共六个旅强，计伤一七一九一人，毙六四一一人，俘二二六五六人；其番号为晋冀鲁豫区的四一师一○四旅全部，四七师一二五旅大部，四○师三九旅一○六旅共一个团，二七师四九旅两个连以上共合两个旅。东北区的五十二军二十五师全部，七十一军八十八师一个营，新一军五十师一个营，六十军暂二十一师一个营，一八四师五个连，共一个旅零一个团。山东区的第八军一六师、荣一师各一个营，一○三师三个营，四六师一七五旅一个营，一八八旅两个营，二八师八○旅及五九师七七师各一部共一个半团，九六军暂十四师七三军十五师一九三师各一部共一个团，五四军三六师一个连，共合四个半团。华中区的七十四师五十一旅五十八旅及二十八师各一小部共两个营，第一军一七一师一七二师各一部共一个半团，五七师（原九十八军）一个营，共合两个半团。晋绥区的四十三军暂三十九师第三师全部；十九军暂四○师第三团大部，共合一个半团。晋察冀热辽区的九四军第五师十三团一部，五十三军一一六师一三○师各一部，三十五军一○一师两个营，共合一个半团。消灭蒋地方保安团队及伪军一二二五八人，计伤二九六七人，毙一六六○人，俘七五七一人。总计毙伤蒋伪军三○二二九人，俘三○二二七人。生擒一○四旅旅长杨显明、副旅长李克源、二五师师长李正谊、副师长段培德、团长黄德亮、冯营昌、赵正国等将校军官十四名。
    缴获步马枪二五六八五支，短枪七四八支，轻机枪一○三六挺，重机枪一二六挺，手提机枪二一六挺、掷弹筒一六六个，迫击炮七九门，山炮野炮共六八门，火箭炮六门，战防炮十一门，枪弹千万发，炮弹千余发，坦克车二辆，汽车×七辆。击落飞机三架，骝马一六一匹，军粮五万三千石。
    蒋军共占我广灵、康保、新明、五台、定襄、沽源、徐水、望都、蔚县、卢龙、掖县、安邱、高苑、启东、宽甸、通化等十六个县，被我军恢复满城、＠城、平度、齐东、寿光、桓台、昌邑、济源、怀仁、大宁、永和、蒲县、隰县、石楼等十五个县城。
