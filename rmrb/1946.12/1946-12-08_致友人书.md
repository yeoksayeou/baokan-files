　　Letter to a Friend
    Chen Jinkun
    Editor's Note: Mr. Yu Chang, styled Jimen, once served as the President of the Dali Court. Mr. Shi Zhiquan, styled Youding, once served as the Vice Minister of Justice. Mr. Shen Jiayi, styled Jiaoao, served as the President of the High Court. He and Mr. Chen Jinkun were classmates at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan and are all elders in the judicial circle. This letter is Mr. Chen's open letter to the three gentlemen, the original letter is as follows:
　　　　        
    To my respected elder brothers Youding, Jimen, and Jiaoao:

    I have not been able to express my feelings frankly in Peiping, and I often feel that I have failed my old friends of several decades. Now that we are about to part for a considerable period, I am writing to express my innermost thoughts. My brothers and I are all getting old. Before Japan was about to surrender last year, I mentioned to you that I planned to buy land outside Chaoyangmen to build a garden, plant flowers and vegetables, and enjoy my old age. However, after a lifetime of hard work and enduring eight years of frustration, once I saw peace again, I initially thought of relaxing, but then I went against my original intention and got involved in politics, which was not my responsibility. Public opinions on the current situation may differ from mine, but I always believe that Chiang Kai-shek should bear full responsibility for today's events. I have always been fair in my judgment. Before 1928, the revolution and after 1937, the War of Resistance against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek was indeed meritorious, but I still believe that merits and demerits cannot offset each other. The success of the previous revolution was due to Sun Yat-sen's great vision, which included cooperation with the Communists, gaining the cooperation of farmers and workers; and external alliance with Soviet Russia, gaining international sympathy; the revolution thus had strength, and the banner became more distinct. At that time, the goal was "anti-imperialism" and "anti-feudalism," which is the policy set by the Communist Party, and it is still being resolutely implemented. However, Chiang Kai-shek violated Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, turning against the Communists and the Soviets midway, achieving "one-party dictatorship" and "personal autocracy," so he had to be an enemy of friendly parties and friendly nations on the same front, and instead colluded with imperialist bureaucratic politicians and compradores, completely abandoning the anti-imperialist and anti-feudalist ideas, and moving towards another path of fascism. Thus, he implemented autocracy, excluded dissidents, and there were countless "military conflicts" and "civil wars." In addition to "purging the Communists" and "suppressing the Communists" for more than ten years, until he was captured alive, he also excluded Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, Li Zongren, Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan, and suppressed Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan, and Yunnan, etc. Each time, he triggered coups or wars, resulting in the depletion of national strength and the weakening of political effectiveness, which was worse than any warlord era since the Republic of China. In addition, he exclusively appointed "personal relatives" and "personal cronies," such as the Kong, Song, and Chen families, resulting in a corrupt atmosphere, setting an unprecedented example in Chinese and foreign history, insulting himself and others, and thus inviting the "September 18th Incident." He also advocated "non-resistance," which led to the "July 7th Incident." In these fourteen years and eight years of violent Japanese aggression, the loss of national land, public and private property, and the lives of compatriots are countless. All this was caused by Chiang Kai-shek's "one mistake."

    The success of the later War of Resistance was due to the unity of the people, the cooperation of the Communist Party, and the dedication of the soldiers, while Chiang Kai-shek maintained an attitude of "being ready to compromise at any time." If the violent Japanese had not been deprived of their spirit by heaven, they could have first destroyed the Northeast, and then they would have been able to destroy the whole country. Everyone can see this. Chiang Kai-shek invited this滔天大祸, risked this danger of national subjugation, and was lucky enough to be among the so-called "four great national heroes," so he should reflect deeply from the beginning. After Japan surrendered, he tried his best to move in the direction of "restoration" and "revival," but he still continued his dream of "dictatorship and autocracy." The minimum requirement for a politician is to have a bright mind, a broad mind, and a generous mind, but Chiang Kai-shek is the opposite: cunning, temperamental, and narrow-minded, so that loyal advice cannot be heard, and righteous people cannot be approached. He never respects public opinion, and even disregards integrity, abandoning the agreement with the Communist Party to jointly resist Japan. At first, he did not issue a single salary or weapon, then he disbanded the New Fourth Army, and at any time he used his direct and miscellaneous troops to monitor or attack the Communist army. If the Communist army were not loyal patriots and did not continue to fight to the death behind enemy lines, what would the future hold? When Japan surrendered, he went even further, advocating "leniency" towards the violent Japanese and traitors, even allowing the enemy puppet army to guard the cities and maintain their weapons, and even made the traitor leaders commanders and treated them as honored guests. As for the Communist army, not only did he not reward them, but he also exerted pressure on them, and finally "suppressed" them. There was no reward, no right or wrong, and no discipline, which was also an unprecedented example in Chinese and foreign history. Chiang Kai-shek used internal and external blockade policies to prevent people at home and abroad from knowing the situation in the Communist-controlled anti-Japanese areas, but foreigners had a considerable understanding. Therefore, US President Roosevelt insisted on contacting the Communist Party; American journalists also wrote books, praising the Communist Party very much. Chiang Kai-shek himself also knew that the existence of the Communist Party was not conducive to his dictatorship, so he always adhered to the "anti-communist" policy, and followed the old tricks of German, Italian, and Japanese fascists, using "preventing communism and opposing the Soviet Union" as his "selfish" means. Germany, Italy, and Japan were dictatorial at home and aggressive abroad, while Chiang Kai-shek could only learn half of it. In addition to using the "special agent policy" inherent in fascism, he also used the "civil war policy" uniquely created by the Chiang family. Twenty days after August 15th last year, at a dinner party with you all, when the guests congratulated each other on the victory, I said coldly, "The world will be full of troubles from now on." Jiaoao scolded me for being wrong, how is it today?

    The current situation is just that the people are not living well, so "people are thinking of the Han," and Chiang Kai-shek is even more insane, selling his country and fighting his battles. The front door drives away the tiger, and the back door lets in the wolf. One Japan is gone, and one America is coming. All national sovereignty and national interests, such as territory, territorial waters, airspace, inland rivers, customs, garrisons, and military training, have been handed over to the so-called allied nations. Daring to sell the country is also an unprecedented example in Chinese and foreign history. The price obtained is only that American troops are rampant in the country (it is reported that our student lawyer Wang Zhenhua was also killed by an American military vehicle). He also uses the most sophisticated weapons supplied by the United States to kill meritorious soldiers and innocent compatriots. This is also an unprecedented example in Chinese and foreign history. This is Chiang Kai-shek's "second mistake." An ancient saying says, "One mistake cannot be made again." I would like to say this to Chiang Kai-shek.

    I went to Yan'an before and saw that the city was completely destroyed by the Japanese. This time, I went to Zhangjiakou and then to Yan'an again, and along the way I saw countless cities and villages burned and bombed by the Japanese. The "Three Alls Policy" pursued by the Japanese is now personally witnessed. This shows the power of the Communist Party and the people to resist Japan, but Chiang Kai-shek does not take this into account and insists on attacking the liberated areas. I really don't know what his intentions are. As for the situation in the liberated areas led by the Communist Party, I am a non-partisan and have no emotional prejudice, as you all know well. From what I have seen in Yan'an and Zhangjiakou and along the way (this time I went through Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces), I really feel that there is a world of difference between the liberated areas and the non-liberated areas, that is, the political achievements of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. What I have experienced are still economically and culturally backward areas, but they are already "民康物阜," that is, people's lives have been greatly improved, production has also been greatly increased, and education has also been greatly developed. In particular, corruption has disappeared, bandits have disappeared, beggars have disappeared, democracy and autonomy have become very common, and officials and the army are very disciplined. From top to bottom, the army and the people are united as one. The purpose of "serving the people" advocated by Chairman Mao is fully implemented by the party, government, and military. They can all understand that they are not above the people, but are in the midst of the people. They themselves are one of the people. Doing things for the people is doing things for themselves, breaking the concept of those who govern people. Their spirit is even more in "public and forgetting private, country and forgetting family." The above makes the country a big family, and they themselves are parasitic in it. The old age, death, and disease of oneself and one's family are guaranteed by the state; and there is a characteristic that dealing with people is all sincere. I have always advocated that Zeng Guofan of Hunan said that "only with the spirit of a scholar can one do things." Communist Party figures all have the spirit of a scholar, that is, they are all scholars by nature. This is exactly to my liking. The current policy of the Communist Party is stated in the party constitution as "New Democracy, New Capitalism, and cooperation with the intellectual class," that is, the Communist Party only seeks to implement constitutional government and democracy, and advocates the Three-Thirds System, that is, limiting party members to only one-third in the government, and the rest should be participated by other parties and non-partisans and all enlightened democratic people, only limiting the malpractices of the old constitutional countries, and advocating "national capital labor cooperation." The land policy principle is still based on the two-five rent reduction regulations of the Land Law. The principle of "those who till the land should have their land" advocated by Sun Yat-sen, the so-called "land distribution," has not been universal. At present, it is only carried out for the land of corrupt local bullies and enemy puppets. The so-called "liquidation" and "poor people turning over" are the result of the emotions of the oppressed people when they were first liberated. Although the government does not stop it, it still supervises and corrects it at any time. I deeply know that the Communist Party is truly for the people, so the pursuit of peaceful unification, unity, and cooperation comes from the sincerity of the Communist Party. The United States and Soviet Britain especially marked out policies to assist the above-mentioned goals, and they actually believe that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can cooperate and must cooperate. Chairman Mao's solo trip to Chongqing last year can be said to be a national heroic act in history. Countless concessions, withdrawals from vast lands, and reductions of many troops are also "tolerating for the sake of the country." However, Chiang Kai-shek, although subdued by the spirit and democratic power of the Communist Party, reluctantly signed the truce agreement, the Political Consultative Conference resolution, and the military reorganization plan, but soon regretted it. The current problem is only whether Chiang Kai-shek can sincerely implement these three agreements. If he must rely on foreign aid and continue the civil war, I can assert that Chiang Kai-shek's goal of eliminating the Communist Party can never be achieved; the United States' goal of invading China can never be achieved. If the civil war does not stop, the Chinese people will not be able to live, what is the future? The wise know it. Because of the lessons of long-term foreign troubles, the current people's power and national concept are far from comparable to the era of the Northern Warlord government. The fate of Wang Jingwei and Japan will inevitably be re-enacted by another person and another country. My brothers and I are all members of the 先知先觉, so I dare to present my humble opinions to you, in order to make a call from the high mountains and do our best as common people. I will also publish this letter to the public, and I hope you will not think it is crazy and absurd. I am very grateful and fortunate!

　　致友人书
    陈瑾昆
    编者按：余＠昌先生，号戟门，曾任大理院长。石志泉先生号友仃，曾任司法次长。沈家彝先生号季傲，曾历任高等法院院长，与陈瑾昆先生在日本东京帝国大学同学，均为司法界耆宿。此书为陈先生对三先生之公开信，原信如下：
　　　　        
    友仃、戟门、季傲三学长兄钧鉴：
    在平未舒畅述所怀，每自念有负数十年老友。兹因相别恐有相当时日，特奉书一吐年来骨鲠弟与诸公均垂垂老矣，在去年日本将投降以前，弟会与诸公言之，拟在朝阳门外，购地筑圃，栽花种菜，娱我晚年。乃因辛苦半生，又饱受八年闷气，一旦重见太平，自作劳民体休之想，然竟一反本怀与索性，过问非本分之政治，实非偶然。公开时局见解，或与弟不无异同，然弟总以为今日之事，蒋公应负完全责任。弟亦素为公平论事之人，民十七以前之革命，与民二十六以后之抗战，蒋公诚为有功，然弟究认为功罪不能相抵。以前之革命成功，实由于孙中山先生之伟见，内容中共，得有农工合作；外联苏俄，得有国际同情；革命始有力量，旗帜始更鲜明。当时目标为“反帝”与“反封建”，此即中共所定之政策，至今尚在坚决实行。而蒋公则违反中山先生遗志，中途反共反苏，达到“一党专政”“一己独裁”，故不得不与同一战线之友党友邦为敌，反而与帝国主义官僚政客买办相勾结，完全抛弃反帝反封建之主张，走向法西斯之另一途径。于是实行专制，排除异己，乃有无数次“兵讧”与“内战”。除“清共”“剿共”历十余年终至被人活捉而外，排汪、排胡、排李、排冯、阎，排粤、川、湘、滇等，每次均掀起政变或战乱，以致国力消耗，政效倭微，较民国来任何军阀时代为甚。加以专任“私亲”“私党”，如孔、宋，陈等，以致污浊之风，开中外历史上未有之前例，自侮人侮，乃招来“九一八”事变。又主张“不抵抗主义”，更招来“七七”事变。此十四年与八年暴日侵略，丧失国家土地、公私财产、同胞生命直不可以数计，此均为蒋公“一误”所致。
    以后抗战之成功，实由于人民齐心，中共协力，将士用命，而蒋公则系持“随时可以妥协”之态度。苟非暴日天夺其魄，则先可以亡东四省，再必可以亡全国，此尽人所能见及者。蒋公招此滔天大祸，冒此亡国危险，竟侥幸得跻于所谓“四大民族英雄”之一，则应从头猛省。在日本投降后，极力向“复员”与“复兴”两个方向作去，乃仍继续其“独裁专政”之迷梦。自来政治家最低条件，必须心地光明、胸襟阔大、度量宽宏，而蒋公则适得其反，心地奸险、性情刚复、度量狭小，以致忠言不能入耳，正士不能近身，从不尊重民意，更不顾全信义，背弃与中共共同抗日之协定，始则不发一饷一械，继则解散新四军，并随时使嫡系并杂牌军队，对中共军队监视或进攻。万一中共军队不为精忠爱国者与在敌后方不出死力继续奋斗，则前途何堪设想？其在日本投降时，更为倒行逆施，对于暴日与汉奸，则主张“宽大”，甚至仍使敌伪军队，代为看管城池，保持武器，汉奸巨头反而封为司令，待为上宾。对于中共军队，则不但不加奖赏，反施压迫，最后即行“剿灭”，无赏罚，无是非、无纪纲，亦开中外历史上未有之前例。蒋公挟持内外封锁政策，不使国内外人士知悉中共抗战区域内之情形，然外国人士均有相当了解。故美罗斯福总统，坚持联络中共；美国记者亦有著述，甚为构道中共；蒋公本人亦深知中共存在，于伊独裁不利，故始终抱定“反共”宗旨，且效德、意、日法西斯之故智以“防共反苏”为其“自私自利”之手段。德、意、日对内独裁对外侵略，而蒋公则只能学其一半，除沿用法西斯故有之“特务政策”，外尚加用蒋家独创之“内战政策”。弟在去年八月十五日后二十日前，与诸公聚餐席上，众客群贺胜利之时，即发一冷语谓：“天下从此多事”。戟公当斥为失言，今日何如？
    目前景象只是民不聊生，因而“人心思汉”，蒋公则更丧心病狂，大卖其国，大打其仗。前门逐虎，后门进狼，去一日本，来一美国，举凡领土、领海、领空、内河、海关、驻军、练兵等一切国家主权，民族利益，俱已双手奉送所谓盟邦，大胆卖国，亦开中外历史上未有之前例，所得代价，只是美军在国内横行（报载吾等学生王振华律师亦被美兵车撞死）。更用美国供给最精锐之武器，残杀有功之将士与无辜之同胞，此亦开中外历史上未有之前例，此即蒋公之“再误”。古语云：“一误不可再误”，愿为蒋公言之。
    弟前赴延安，见城市全为日人炸毁；此次赴张家口，再赴延安，沿途更见无数城市乡村，为日人焚毁炸平。日人所持之“三光政策”，今乃亲身目睹，此正见中共与人民抗战之力，而蒋公毫不以此为念，坚持向解放区进攻，诚不知其是何居心。至于中共领导之解放区情形，弟为无党派者，且为无感情偏见者，乃为公等所深知。以弟在延安与张家口并沿途所见（此次历冀、察、晋、陕诸省），实觉解放区与非解放区，即国共两党政治成绩，乃有天渊之别。弟所历者，尚为经济文化均形落后之地，然已“民康物阜”即民生已大见改善，生产亦大见增加，教育亦大见发达，尤为贪污绝迹、盗匪绝迹、乞丐绝迹，民主与自治已极普遍，官吏与军队均极整肃，上到下、军与民打成一片，毛主席所倡“为人民服务”之宗旨，完全为党政军三方面所实行。均能了解其非在民众上面，系在民众中，自己即为民众中一人，为老百姓作事，即系为自己作事，打破治人治于人者之观念。其精神更在“公而忘私，国而忘家”。以上使国家成为一大家庭，而自己即寄生托命于其中。本人与家族之老死疾病，均由国家保障；并有一特色，接人处事均出真诚。弟素主张吾湘曾涤生“有士气才能作事”之说，中共人物无不有士气，即均系书生本色，此于弟正是声气相投。中共目前政策，则于党章载明为“新民主主义，新资本主义，并与知识阶级合作”，即中共只求实施宪政与民主，且主张三三制，即限制党员在政府中只应占三分之一，余则使他党派与无党派并一切开明民主人士参加，惟限止旧宪政国家之流弊，提倡“民族资本劳资合作”。土地政策原则，尚系实土地法二五减租之规定，孙中山先生所倡“耕者有其田”之主张所谓“土地分配”并未普遍。现时只对于贪污土劣敌伪之土地行之。所谓“清算”“穷人翻身”，则是初解放时受压迫民众之情绪所致，政府虽不加阻止，但仍随时监督与纠正。弟深知中共乃真心为民者，故求和平统一团结合作，乃出于中共之至诚，美国与苏英特别标出协助上述目标之政策，亦实相信国共可以合作、且必须合作。毛主席去岁单身赴重庆，可谓历史上一种民族英雄行动，无数次让步撤退广大土地与裁减甚多军队，亦正是“相忍为国”。无如蒋公虽为中共精神与民主力量所压服，勉强签定停战协定、政协决议与整军方案，然旋即翻悔。现时问题，只在蒋公能否诚意实行此三个协定，若必依持外援，继续内战，弟可断言，蒋公消灭共产党之目的绝对不能达到；美国侵略中国之目的，亦绝对不能达到。内战不停，中国人民均不得活，其前途何待？智者知之。中国因有长期外患之教训，现时人民力量与国家观念，已远非以前北洋政府时代可比，汪精卫与日本之运命，必将另有一人一国重演。弟与公等均为先知先觉一分子，故弟敢为公等一陈鄙见，以期同作高山之呼，共尽匹夫之责，弟亦将以此书公诸于人，望勿以为狂谬，感甚幸甚！
