　　Zong Jiting
    By Zhang Zhihan
  　His Background
    Zong Jiting is from Sichuan, thirty years old. His family owns forty mu of paddy fields. He served as bao chief for three years and as part of the security team for one and a half years. He trained local militia, had two years of schooling, and lived comfortably at home. He was well-connected locally. Every time the Kuomintang government needed recruits, he managed to evade the draft. After all the young men were taken, and with no other options, he put on a long gown, wore a watch and glasses, and very ostentatiously volunteered for military service to cover the entire bao. This seemed like a strange thing to do. That was during the Anti-Japanese War, when he thought, "If the country falls, there is no home. It is right to contribute to the effort to resist Japan and save the nation." So he went to the Ninth Replenishment Training Center in Dingjiangzhai as a soldier, and then went to the artillery company to learn how to fire 82mm mortars. In 1942, he was transferred to the "Expeditionary Force." He took a car to Kunming, then a plane to India, and then a two-hour boat ride to Calcutta, where he was still made to study artillery. Eight months later, he fell seriously ill. Fearing contagion, the foreigners sent him back to the Ninth Replenishment Training Center and assigned him to Zhang Guiluo’s cavalry regiment in Chongqing. He worked there as a cavalryman for a year and a half, and later went to the 141st Division of the 32nd Army, where he served as a squad leader (later promoted to platoon leader), using a Maxim heavy machine gun. When the troops were reorganized (the Sichuan Army was reorganized in 1945), he wanted to go home but was kept by the Third Division and sent to Hebei, where they attacked the Liberated Areas along the Pinghan Railway.
　  His Eyes Opened in the Eighth Route Army
    Like many Kuomintang soldiers forced to fight the civil war, the Eighth Route Army liberated him. At first, he was not used to it, and thought: if a company of more than a hundred people can get used to it, why can't I? So he calmed down. Shi Xiangting, who provoked him, wanted to desert with him in Gancaoying, but he refused. Immediately afterwards, he watched the new play "Blood and Tears of Hatred," and his thinking changed. He saw Wang Guihua spinning cotton, and how good the Liberated Areas were, something he had never seen before. He also saw the regiment commander delivering meals during land reclamation, with the army and the people as one family. At this point, he thought he absolutely had to go and see the old Liberated Areas. Soon, another bad guy asked him to run away, but Zong Jiting refused, saying, "What's the point of running? If the Central Army catches you, you'll still be doing three months of work anyway?"
    Zong Jiting was originally in the Third Battalion, whose commander was from Sichuan. The commander had a heart-to-heart talk with him, and Zong Jiting's understanding of and confidence in the Eighth Route Army increased. In Yupo, Huaiqing, he met a demobilized Eighth Route Army soldier from his hometown, who explained in detail some of the Eighth Route Army's living habits and told him to study hard, and that he would fall behind if he didn't speak at discussion meetings. After hearing this, he thought to himself: "Others may not believe it, but how can I not believe my fellow villager?" From then on, he also spoke at meetings. He saw how well the people treated demobilized soldiers, something he had never seen in the rear areas, and he became even more determined to work in the Eighth Route Army. He said, "I've been a squad and platoon leader in the Central Army, but even Commander-in-Chief Gao Shuxun can put everything down and come over, there must be a reason. What am I? The Eighth Route Army doesn't go against conscience, and the common people help everywhere. When we attacked Huixian, the common people welcomed us with gongs and drums, and there was tea everywhere. That's when I realized that I was determined to work in the Eighth Route Army for the rest of my life." He also said, "Because the Eighth Route Army is a team that speaks of justice, it is bound to develop greatly."
  　Found His Own Unit
    This time in the Denzhai battle south of the railway, he was wounded in the left leg. In the hospital, he saw the care from the students, the white flour and pork he ate every day, the soap and cigarettes for comfort, and the towels and other things. Everyone was also awarded four hundred yuan. He felt that the superiors really cared, and at the time he said to the director: "Director, I will go to the front lines, it is an honor to sacrifice in the Eighth Route Army." The director did not allow it, and he stayed for twelve days, and only left the hospital after he had recovered his health.
    His companions who were discharged from the hospital went to find their respective units. He and Wang Zongming (from Anhui, who came to our army at the same time) from the Fifth Company also went to find their units. They went all the way to the Longhai Railway, crossed the road, and walked for half a day, encountering the Seventh Company of the × Unit of the New Fourth Army, and were hosted for the night by squad leader Zhang Guihua. Zong Jiting explained their situation to them, and Comrade Zhang Guihua said, "You should still go and find your units." They returned in a northwest direction, heard gunfire there and went to look for it, found the enemy in Caoxian, and turned back from the northwest of Caoxian. On September 12th, he finally found his unit. He himself said, "I thought on the road: raising soldiers for a thousand days, using them for a moment. After I come back, I can't do big things, but it's good to do small things. So I was determined to find the unit."

　　宗吉廷
    张之韩作
  　他的来历
    宗吉廷四川人，三十岁了，家里有四顷水田，在家当过三年保长，一年半保安队，训练过壮丁，读过二年书，家庭生活很好，在地方上是吃得开的。国民党政府每次要壮丁，他都应付过去了。青年人抽完了，实在没法想，他便穿起长袍，戴上手表、眼镜，很阔气的去顶了全保的兵役，这看来是一件怪事。那是抗日时代的事，当时想“国亡无家，为抗日救国出力也是应该的”。他就到了丁江砦第九补训处当了兵，以后就到炮兵连学打八二迫击炮。到一九四二年，他被调到“远征军”，坐汽车到昆明，又坐飞机到了印度，再坐两小时轮船到了加尔各答，还是让他学炮。八个月后，患了大病，外国人怕传染，把他打转来，送回第九补训处，分配到重庆张桂罗的骑兵团。他在那里干了一年半骑兵，后来又到了三十二军的一四一师，在那里当了班长（后升排长），使用一挺马克新重机枪。到队伍整编时（一九四五年川军整编），想回家又被第三师留住，开到河北，沿平汉路进攻解放区。
　  在八路军他打开了眼睛
    和许多被迫打内战的国民党士兵一样，八路军把他解放了。刚来时过不惯，又想：一个连一百多人都过得惯，我为啥还过不惯？就平下心了。挑拨他的史祥亭在甘草营想和他开小差，他不干。紧接着看了一回新戏《血泪仇》，思想起了变化。看到王桂花纺棉花，解放区那样好，没见过；又见到开荒时团长送饭，军民一家，这时他想非到老解放区去看看不成。不久，另一个坏蛋也叫他跑，宗吉廷就拒绝他说：“跑干啥？你跑让中央军抓住，还不是一样干三个月？”
    宗吉廷原在三营，营长是四川人，对他谈过心，以后也对八路军增加了认识与信心。在怀庆于坡，他又碰到一个八路军退伍的同乡，那人详细的给他讲了些八路军生活习惯，并嘱咐他好好学习，讨论会不发言就会落后。他听了这番话自己想：“别人可以不相信，自己老乡还能不相信？”自此后也在会上发言了。他看到人民这样优待退伍军人，在大后方是见不到的，他就更加坚定了在八路军干的信念。他说过：“我在中央军班排长也干过；可是高树勋是司令长官，还能放下一切过来，一定有个道理。咱可算个啥？八路军不亏良心，到处有老百姓帮助。打辉县时老百姓锣鼓欢迎，到处有茶水。这样我就看准了，决心要在八路军干一辈子。”又说：“因为八路军是讲公理的队伍，总要大大发展的。”
  　找到了自己的部队
    这次在铁路南邓寨作战，他左腿负伤了。他在医院看到学生们的照顾，每天吃的白面、猪肉，慰劳的肥皂纸烟，还有毛巾等，每人还奖励了四百元。他觉得上级实在关心，当时就对所长说：“所长，我到前方去，在八路军牺牲也是光荣的”。所长不准，一直住了十二天，健康恢复后才出院。
    出院的同伴各找队伍去了。他和五连的王宗明（安徽人，同时来我军的）两人也去找队伍，一直找到陇路铁路上去，过了路又走了半天，遇到新四军×部第七连，被班长张桂花招待了一夜。宗吉廷对他们说明自己的情况，张桂花同志说：“你还是去找队伍吧。”他俩向西北方向返回来，听到那里有枪响就往那里去找，找到曹县发现敌人，就从曹县西北转回来。到了九月十二日，他才找到部队，他自己说：“我在路上想：养兵千日，用兵一时。我回来后干不了大事，干点小事也好哇。所以坚决找队伍。”
