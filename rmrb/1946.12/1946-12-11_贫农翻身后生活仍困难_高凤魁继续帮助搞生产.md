    Poor Peasants Still Face Hardships After Turning Over
    Gao Fengkui Continues to Help with Production
    Note: Gao Fengkui is a model in En County. His leadership methods have several characteristics:
    He is always thinking of the masses and sets an example in everything. A phrase that often comes from Fengkui's mouth is: "For the benefit of the masses, I would even die." For the peasants of Gao Village to turn over, he carried two cold cornbread buns and braved dangers to go to the plains to learn skills. Now that the people of Gao Village have turned over, he wants everyone to live well by being thrifty and frugal. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, Fengkui called on everyone to help each other "emotionally and righteously." Those without livestock helped with labor, and those with livestock provided animal power. As a result, in Gao Village for ten days, the fields were full of groups of men and women, and the old men smiled and said, "For so many years, we have never had it so easy, saving so much effort."
    Fengkui made calculations for several poor peasant households who had been allocated land and found that several families would not have enough grain to last until the next wheat harvest. Therefore, he helped these households plan production. Lü Sancheng said, "With Gao Fengkui in our village, the poor are guaranteed not to go hungry. He thinks so thoughtfully for the poor."
    It is difficult to find a blemish in Fengkui's history. Some activists in other villages eat and drink lavishly and waste things casually with the fruits of struggle. Fengkui often said to the villagers, "Let's not learn from that. Let's save the money and distribute it to everyone as capital for business, ensuring that we don't go hungry." He paid great attention to every penny spent by the farmers' association. When Gao Village distributed the fruits of struggle, good furniture was first offered to the poor. The remaining three mu of barren alkaline land, a broken porcelain jar, and two worn-out cotton pants were assigned to Gao Fengkui. His wife reproached him, saying, "Your mother is not happy." He said, "The struggle is not for my mother's happiness, but to lead everyone to turn over. Now that the Communist Party has come, why should we worry about food and clothing?"
    He consults on everything and never acts arbitrarily. Fengkui often said, "A big hand cannot cover the sky, and the masses are sages." Among the fruits of struggle was a bag of millet. People all regarded it as "rare grain." When distributing it, Fengkui asked everyone to discuss it. Finally, it was decided that each person would get two bowls to make New Year's cakes during the New Year, and everyone was happy. He consults with the masses and discusses everything, big and small, in the village before doing it. Therefore, no matter who you ask among the masses, "How were the fruits of struggle distributed in your village?" they will readily tell you the method. Gao Village is as united as an iron barrel. Everyone has one mind, and when a task is assigned from above, Gao Village immediately takes action.
    When fighting tigers, strike the head first; fiercely struggle against the big bad guys. When Gao Village struggled against Li Maozhu, Fengkui listened to the opinions of the masses: "Struggle fiercely." He said, "Yes! This kind of hateful bad person should be fiercely struggled against." After the struggle, the association should take turns talking to Li Maoyong, who was deceived, to help him "change his mind." The poor and impoverished family members of pseudo-bandits who should have been allocated fruits of struggle were given a "probation period" for education. If they improve, they will still get the fruits of struggle. In this way, Li Maoyong's family spoke from the bottom of their hearts: "Based on what we did in the past, we should have been driven out of the village. Today, the farmers' association not only distributes grain but also land to us. In the future, we must act with conscience."
    Gao Fengkui is very careful in his work. He can lead the village to do everything well. Gao Fengkui loves the masses, and the masses love him. He believes that by following the Communist Party, he can unleash his talents and create amazing achievements.

    贫农翻身后生活仍困难
    高凤魁继续帮助搞生产
    按：高凤魁在恩县是一面旗帜，他的领导方法有几个特点：
    处处为群众，样样作表率。经常流露在凤魁嘴边的一句话：“为着大众的利益，叫我死去也干。”为着高庄的农民翻身，怀里揣上两个凉窝窝，他不避艰险的跑到平原学本领。高庄人民翻了身，他要大家俭省细用的过好光景。秋收种麦时，凤魁号召大家要“情赶情义赶义”的相互帮助，没牲口的帮人工，有牲口的出畜力。因而十日里的高庄，漫野里是一群群的男女，老头子笑开嘴说：“多少年来没有过这样省工夫，省力气”。
    凤魁给分得土地的几户贫农打了打算盘，算出好几家的粮食吃不到明年的麦收，于是他就帮着这些户计划生产。吕三成说：“俺村有了高凤魁，保险穷人挨不了饿，人家替穷人想的周到的哩”。
    从凤魁的历史上很难找出个污点来。有些庄子的积极分子拿着斗争果实大吃大喝，随便浪费。凤魁常对村民说：“咱们不学那个，留下钱来分给大家作个买卖本，保险不挨饿。”他对农会里一文钱的开支都非常注意。高庄分果实时，好家具先让穷人要，剩下的三亩破碱地，一个破瓷缸，两条破棉裤，算给了高凤魁，老婆责备他说：“咱母亲不高兴。”他说：“斗争不是为了母亲高兴，是领导大家翻身。今天来了共产党，咱还愁吃穿么？”
    有事商量着办，从不自己独断专行。凤魁常说：“手大遮不住天，众人是圣人。”斗争果实里有一口袋稷谷米，人们都认作是“稀罕粮食”。分配时凤魁就交大家讨论，最后决议每人分两碗，过年时做年糕吃，结果都很乐意。村里的大小事他都是经过群众酝酿讨论后，再去办，所以你不管问哪个群众：“你村的果实是怎样分配的？”他就会顺口把办法讲给你听。高庄团结像铁筒，大家没有两条心，上级下达一个任务，在高庄马上就行动起来。
    打虎先打头，大坏人狠斗争。高庄斗李茂竹，凤魁听取了群众意见：“狠狠的斗。”他说：“对！这种人人痛恨的坏东西，就是狠狠斗”。斗争过后，要会里轮流着找被骗分子李茂庸谈话，帮助他“换脑筋”。应分得果实的贫苦伪匪家属给他们留下“候补期”，进行教育，变好了照样得果实。这样就使李茂庸一家子说出了良心话：“按咱过去办的事，赶出咱村子也应该，今天人家农会不但分给粮食，还分给咱地，今后可得凭良心去办事。”
    高凤魁在工作中非常细心，村里的事他能领导着样样做到头里。高凤魁热爱着群众，群众也热爱着他。他相信跟着共产党走，便能发挥自己的才智，创造出惊人的事业。
