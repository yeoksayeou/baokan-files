    Poor Little Village Relies on the Mountain
    Lingnan Organizes Surplus Labor
    Earns 130,000 Yuan in Half a Year
    [Our newspaper, He Shun News] Lingnan Village, in the Second District of the county, has 39 households with 132 people. Except for two middle-peasant households, the rest are mostly poor peasants, with more than 500 mu of hillside land. The masses have always lived in poverty. There are five mutual aid teams in the village. This spring, the first team extracted surplus labor to engage in sideline production, but they lacked capital. So they chopped down 110,000 shuttle pegs from looms and sold them in Xingtai, earning five or six yuan per peg, totaling 50,000 yuan, which solved the capital problem. The third team built a blacksmith's furnace and contacted the village transportation team to transport coal back and goods out, earning 28,000 yuan per month. In August, the transportation team sent copper to Xingtai again, earning 60,000 yuan. The Lingnan Cooperative mainly organizes the surplus labor of the masses to cut mountain goods and engage in transportation, earning a total profit of more than 131,000 yuan in half a year. The average income per person is more than 1,000 yuan. They implemented the policy of "relying on the mountain to eat the mountain" and gained great benefits.

    穷小村靠山吃山
    岭南组织剩余劳力
    半年赚钱十三万元
    【本报和顺讯】该县二区岭南村三十九户，一百三十二口人，除两户中农外，其余大都是贫农，共有山坡地五百余亩，群众生活一向穷苦。村里有五个变工组。今春第一组抽出剩余劳力来想搞些副业生产，但没有本钱。于是砍了十一万根织布机上的铮棍拉到邢台出卖，每根价洋五、六元，共得五万元，解决了本钱问题。第三组搞一座铁匠炉，和本村运输队联系好：往回运煤，往外驮货，一个月赚洋两万八千元。八月间，运输队又往邢台送了一次铜，赚洋六万元。岭南合作社主要是组织群众剩余劳力砍山货、搞运输，半年来共获利十三万一千余元。平均每口人收入一千余元。他们实行了“靠山吃山”的方针，获了很大的利。
