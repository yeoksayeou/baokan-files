　　Jinnan Daily Publishes Editorial
    Eradicate Remaining Peace Fantasies
    Adhere to Posts and Strictly Observe Discipline
    Demand Development and Glorification of Guerrilla Warfare Skills
    [Our newspaper Weixian 23rd dispatch] Jinnan Daily published an editorial titled "Organize, Enter the War," pointing out that with the enemy in the southern front peeking at Daming, and the enemy in the northern front deploying troops attempting to join forces in Xingtai from the north and south to open the Pinghan Road, it is first necessary to eradicate the erroneous understanding of "no war in Jinnan" and the blindly optimistic ideas remaining in the minds of some cadres. It emphasized that "the Chiang army still has the possibility of launching offensives in local areas," and we must not relax our fighting spirit because the overall war situation has turned to our initiative. It also pointed out that although land reform has achieved great success, in some counties and districts, there are phenomena such as the leadership taking over everything, a condescending viewpoint, or individual villages harming the interests of middle peasants, unfair distribution of fruits, and detachment from the masses, which require serious vigilance. We must not be complacent and self-satisfied thinking that land reform is "almost done," and we must continue to implement it deeply. The editorial pointed out: In areas that may be affected by the war, especially border counties, it is necessary to quickly seize the gaps, mobilize and organize all forces to carry out war preparations, implement the "empty house clearing the fields" policy, universally repair and dig underground bunkers and tunnels, and produce large quantities of landmines, stone mines, and hand grenades to prepare for carrying out a large-scale explosion campaign. At the same time, special attention should be paid to reorganizing the militia and self-defense forces. It called on all cadres to adhere to their work posts and remain in their original areas. The set of skills that cadres at all levels in Jinnan used in the past to lead the masses in developing guerrilla warfare and leading the masses in combat has now come to the time to be displayed and glorified. Finally, it pointed out: With the war coming, cadres must consciously obey orders and abide by discipline. In work, do not refuse to execute or stop working on the pretext that your thinking is not clear, do not emphasize your own specialness, use the excuse that the higher authorities do not understand your specific situation, and give discounts in completing tasks, do not make personal problems, or care about personal gains and losses. In relations with the masses, strictly abide by mass discipline, cherish the people's resources and finances, do not spend an extra penny, and do not use an extra grain of rice.

　　冀南日报发表社论
    肃清残存和平幻想
    坚持岗位严守纪律
    要求发扬光大游击作战本领
    【本报威县廿三日电】冀南日报以《组织起来，进入战争》为题，发表社论，指出在南线敌人进窥大名，北线敌人调兵遣将企图南北会师邢台，打通平汉路，首先必须肃清残存在某些干部思想中的“冀南无战争”的错误认识，与盲目乐观的想法。着重指出：“蒋军仍有在局部地区举行进攻的可能”，不能因整个战局已转入主动而松懈自己的斗志。并指出土地改革虽有很大成绩，但有些县区，因领导上包办代替、恩赐观点，或个别村庄还有损害中农利益，分配果实不公，脱离群众等现象，须要严重的警惕，切勿以为土地改革“差不多”而自满自足，还须深入贯彻。社论指出：在战争可能波及的地区，特别是边沿县份，要迅速抓紧空隙，动员组织一切力量，进行备战工作，实行空舍清野，普遍的修理与掘地洞、地道、大量制造地雷、石雷、手榴弹，准备开展大规模的爆炸运动。同时要特别注意整理民兵、自卫队。号召全体干部，必须坚持工作岗位，坚持原地区。过去冀南各级干部，领导群众开展游击战争，带领群众作战的一套本领，又到了施展发扬光大的时候了。最后指出：战争到来了，干部要自觉的服从命令与遵守纪律，在工作上不要借口自己的思想打不通而拒绝执行或停止工作，不要强调自己的特殊，借口上级不了解自己的具体情况，在完成任务上打折扣，不要闹个人问题，计较个人的得失，在与群众的关系上，要严格遵守群众纪律，要爱惜民力财力，不多花一文钱，不多用一粒米。
