Impressions of Yan'an by Three American Journalists

    It has only been in the last two or three years that foreign journalists have been able to openly visit Yan'an. Previously, due to Chiang Kai-shek's strict and prolonged blockade, they had very little opportunity to understand Yan'an, let alone accurately recognize the strength of the people in the liberated areas and thus produce objective and faithful reports. After regular flights between Yan'an and Beiping were established, many foreign journalists scrambled to visit the long-awaited Yan'an. After seeing it, they dispelled all the veils and prejudices and gained a completely new impression of this sacred site of China's New Democratic Revolution. Below are brief excerpts of the observations of three American journalists about Yan'an.

        Rosinger: Yan'an is a Symbol of China's Progress.

    Rosinger is an expert on Far Eastern affairs in the United States, and a special writer for periodicals such as "Foreign Policy Reports" and "The New Republic" magazine. He stayed in Yan'an for ten days in July of this year. After returning to Beiping, he told visiting reporters: "Frankly speaking, Yan'an is just one of the thousands of cities in China, so it cannot be completely detached from the current situation in China. Therefore, I cannot praise it as a paradise on earth without any basis. However, I must affirm that Yan'an is a symbol of China's progress and a pointer to China's bright future."

    "The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party are obviously different from the officials in Nanjing. Let's take a small matter as an analogy. The officials in Nanjing actually have nothing to do, but they pretend to be busy. But the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party are amiable and can have long conversations with you. In order to clarify a problem, we can talk for an entire afternoon, although this may affect their sleep at night, because they have to do the work they missed during the day at night."

    "Chairman Mao is one of the most admirable people I have ever met. He has a very outstanding ability. When he talked to me about American foreign policy, he raised many profound and broad questions. But when I answered him one after another, he only asked a little, or emphatically summarized it, and unconsciously answered the questions I intended to ask him about America's policy toward China."
    
  Steele: You Don't Understand China Until You Go to Yan'an.

    New York Herald Tribune reporter Steele is one of the more authoritative foreign reporters stationed in Ping, but he also has the traditional prejudice against the Soviet Union that American reporters have. When he returned to Beiping after visiting Yan'an in October, someone asked him about his feelings during his ten days in Yan'an. He said, "Generally speaking, you really cannot deeply touch the internal organs of the Chinese problem until you go to Yan'an. Going to Yan'an has deepened my understanding of the Chinese problem. I think there are three things in the Yan'an visit that moved me and made me feel deep. The first thing is that I experienced the 'serving the people' that the Communist Party often talks about. Judging from the various specific facts I witnessed in Yan'an, I think this is genuine. The second thing is that the CPC needs peace and is indeed working for peace. I don't see the CPC having any plans or actions to launch or plan a civil war. The third thing is that I think the members of the CPC sympathize with and support the Soviet Union in their thinking. However, on the other hand, it really broke one of my past understandings, thinking that the CPC and the Soviet Union have any specific connections in reality. They actually have no connections."

    He happened to see General Wang Zhen return to Yan'an after traveling thousands of miles. He described it as: "This is simply not a scene between the people and the army, but like relatives welcoming their returning children. Here I experienced the actual content of the saying 'the army and the people are one family'."

  Strong: The Fate of China Depends on Yan'an.

    Ms. Strong, who visited Yan'an not long ago, expressed her feelings as follows: "Yan'an is a good place! But before the Red Army arrived in northern Shaanxi, it was a dilapidated, poor, and remote place. Now the Chinese Communist Party has built the rural areas there well, and the people are enjoying a normal life of peace, tranquility, and rich labor virtues.

    "The characteristic of Yan'an is simplicity. When I was in Yan'an, Mr. Mao Zedong gave me a book, which was full of pattern paintings of window decorations (referred to as window flowers - editor's note) used in the dwellings of local farmers. General Zhu De gave me a carpet, which was woven with local thread and was also the achievement of local farmers' handicraft industry. The essence of these two gifts is already simple and unadorned; and with the simple patterns, simple lines, and deep colors, it is even more simple."

    Finally, she concluded: "The solution to the fate of the Far East and the solution to the fate of China does not lie in the United States, nor in Nanjing, but in Yan'an! Indeed, the direction of Yan'an is the specific and real direction for solving the problems of the Far East and China."

    三个美国记者的延安印象
    外国记者公开到延安参观，这还是最近二三年的事；向来由于蒋介石严密的长期封锁，他们几乎很难有了解延安的机会，因此也就不可能确切地认识延安，认识解放区人民的力量，从而作出客观忠实的报导。在延安和北平间有了定期的飞行以后，许多外国记者争着要到他们久已向往的延安来观光，看过了之后，他们破除了一切蒙蔽和偏见，对这个中国新民主革命的圣地，有了全新的印象。下面简单摘记下三个美国记者对延安的观感。
        罗辛格：延安是中国进步的象征。
    罗辛格是美国远东问题专家、外交政策汇报与新共和杂志等期刊的特约撰稿人，今年七月曾到延安住了十天，回北平后，他对往访的记者说：“我坦白的讲，延安是中国千百个城市中的一个城市，因而它不可能完全脱离掉中国的现状，因之我不能毫无根据的把它誉之为人间的天堂；然而我必须肯定的说：延安是中国进步的象征，是中国光明的指针。”
    “中共的领袖和南京的官员那是显然不同的，就以一件小小的事情来比拟吧，南京的官员们实际毫无事做，却像煞有介事的摆出忙劲头；但中共的领袖，和蔼可亲，能和你娓娓的长谈，为了弄清一个问题，我们能长谈一个下午，虽然这样也许会影响到他们晚间的睡眠，因为他们得把白天耽误的工作到晚上来做。
    “毛主席是我所见到的最令人钦佩的人物中的一个。他有一种非常卓绝的本领，当他和我对谈美国外交政策的时候，他曾经提出了许多深奥广博的问题。但当我陆续地回答他的时候，他仅仅提出一下，或着重地概括一下，就把我打算询问他的美国对华政策问题，于不知不觉间回答了。”
  斯蒂尔：不到延安，不懂中国。
    纽约先锋论坛报记者斯蒂尔是驻平外记者中比较有权威的一个，但也有着美国记者所具有的对苏联的传统成见。当他十月间参观延安后回到北平的时候，有人问到他在延安十日的感触，他说：“从总的讲来，不到延安实在不能深触到中国问题内脏；到了延安使我对中国问题的认识深化了。我觉得在延安访问中，有三件事使我感动而且深刻起来。第一件是我体味到共产党常常说的‘为人民服务’，证诸在延安所亲见的各种具体事实，我认为这是货真价实的。第二件是中共需要和平，而且也的确为和平而努力；我看不到中共有发动或策划内战的打算与行动。第三件我觉得中共的党员，在思想是同情与拥护苏联的，然而在另一方面的确打破了我过去的一个认识，以为中共与苏联在实际上有什么具体的连系。他们实际上确无什么连系的。”
    他正赶上看到王震将军转战万里回到延安的场面，他形容道：“这简直不像是发生于人民与军队之间的场面，而像亲族欢迎他荣归的子弟，于此我体味了‘军民一家’这个言语的实际内容。”
  史特朗：中国的命运，决于延安。
    前不久去延安访问的史特朗女士，发表她的感想如下：“延安是好地方呀！但红军抵达陕北以前，那里是个破落的贫穷的僻地，现在中国共产党把那里的农村建设好了，人民正享受着和平安宁而富有劳动美德的正常生活。
    “延安的特点是质朴。我在延安的时候毛泽东先生送给我一本书，里面都是当地农民住舍所用的窗饰的图案画（按即窗花——编者）。朱德将军送给我一方地毯，那是用土线织成的，也是当地农民手工业的成绩。这两样礼品的本质已经是质朴无华的；而配合那简素的图案，单纯的线条和深沉的色彩，就更显其朴实了。”
    最后，她下结论说：“解决远东命运的，解决中国命运的，不在于美国，不在于南京，而在延安！的确，延安的方向，是解决远东与中国问题的具体真实的方向。”
