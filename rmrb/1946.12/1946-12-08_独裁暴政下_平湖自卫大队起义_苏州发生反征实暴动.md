　　　Pinghu Self-Defense Corps Uprising
　　　Suzhou Occurs Anti-Grain Requisition Riot
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th】According to a Shanghai newspaper report on November 12th: The "Double-Gun Wang Bamei" guerrilla force, which was active on the Zhejiang border during the Anti-Japanese War, was reorganized into the "Pinghu (Eastern Zhejiang) Self-Defense Corps" after the victory. Having long been unable to bear the oppression of the Chiang government, it revolted last month. Currently, the unit is active in the Lvgong area of Jinshan County, in the southeast of Jiangsu Province. The civil uprising armed forces in Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, are extremely active. Recently, the nephew of the Wujiang County Magistrate went to the countryside under the pretext of borrowing firewood to extort villagers. The rioters were incensed and killed him. The Wujiang County Magistrate ordered the county security team to go to the countryside to "suppress" them, but the security team stationed in a certain village in the sixth district of the county dared not invade. When the civil uprising armed forces came out, the security team hid. After the rioters left, the security team instead said that the people "did not sound the alarm," considering them "bandit" insiders and sending a large number of villagers to the county to report "merit." It is reported that most of the rioters in the county are guerrilla forces from the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, they were forced to take to the mountains because the Chiang government ignored them and they could not make a living.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th】Shanghai News: A peasant revolt against grain requisition occurred in Wu County (Suzhou). The county's rent collection office received an emergency report from the Xiangcheng branch office on the 10th stating that Xing Lufeng, a grain requisition personnel member in Xisha Village, Sijing Town, was resisted by farmers because the government's grain requisition began distributing grain requisition notices. At about 10 p.m. on the 9th, the villagers rang the bell to gather a crowd, with nearly a hundred people joining in. They rushed into the room, tied up Xing with hemp ropes, and beat him severely with wooden sticks and iron rulers, causing him to bleed profusely. The farmers also demolished eight upper and lower threshing floors and one cowshed.

　　独裁暴政下
  　平湖自卫大队起义
  　苏州发生反征实暴动
    【新华社延安五日电】据十一月十二日沪报透露：抗战中活动于浙江边之双枪王八妹游击队，胜利后其所部改编为“平湖（浙东）自卫大队”，久不堪蒋政府之压迫，月前起义。刻该部活动于苏省东南之金山县属吕港一带。江苏吴江县境民变武装极为活跃，最近吴江县长的舅子下乡以借柴为名，勒索乡民，变民激于义愤，将其杀死。吴江县长命令县保安队下乡“清剿”，但保安队驻该县第六区某乡不敢进犯。至民变武装出动时，该保安队就躲藏起来，待变民走后，该保安队反说老百姓“不鸣笛示警”，算作“变匪”内线，将大批乡民送县报“功”。据息：该县变民多系抗战期间的游击部队，胜利后因蒋政府置之不顾，无法谋生，以致逼上梁山。
    【新华社延安五日电】沪讯：吴县（苏州）发生农民反抗田赋征实之暴动事件。该县收租办事处十日接到湘城分办事处紧急报告称：泗泾镇西沙村征收田赋人员邢鲁峰，因政府田赋征实开始分发田赋通知单，遭到农民反抗。九日夜十时许，乡农民鸣钟聚众，附和者几近百人，冲入室内，将邢某用麻绳捆绑，以木棍铁尺痛殴，血流如注，农民等并拆毁上下场房八间，牛棚一间。
