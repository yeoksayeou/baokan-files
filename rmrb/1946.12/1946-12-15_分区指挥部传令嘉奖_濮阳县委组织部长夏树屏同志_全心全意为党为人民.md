    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 8th dispatch] Comrade Xia Shuping is the Organization Minister of the Puyang County Party Committee. Although not a native of Puyang, he has taken root in Puyang. He participated in the opening up of Puyang, waged a long-term concealed struggle against the enemy, and personally led the mass emancipation movement. In this patriotic self-defense war, he again demonstrated unparalleled heroism. After receiving the call from the higher authorities for "cadres to take the lead in joining the army," he was determined to lead the masses in participating in this self-defense struggle. However, because the County Party Committee decided that he could not leave Puyang immediately, he did not join the army. Since the Longhai Campaign began, the county had sent out four batches of stretcher-bearers. He participated in the first three, volunteering to lead the stretcher teams each time. Only in the fourth batch did he not participate because the Party had more important work for him to do. Each time, he went deep into the squads, lived with the civilians, and solved their problems at any time. Especially in the third batch, the composition of the stretcher-bearers was more complex, and the morale of the masses was not high. He was not afraid of difficulties and made every effort to complete the task. He gave up his own livestock to the sick and personally helped carry the stretchers. Under his leadership and influence, district and village cadres also started carrying stretchers. He even personally went to the front line to carry wounded soldiers. The stretcher team he led forgot their fatigue, carried stretchers for fifty or sixty *li* every night without eating, and still returned to the front line with full energy. When carrying the second load, the masses were indeed tired and hungry and unwilling to continue. Comrade Xia loudly proposed: "Let's sweat a little more so that the wounded comrades bleed a little less. Those who are willing to go, follow me!" Many stretcher-bearers bravely followed him again. The masses loved him and trusted him. Every stretcher team whispered, "Let Minister Xia be with us!" He comforted everyone kindly: "I am here, not far away." Everyone was moved and finally successfully completed the task. The higher authorities called on Puyang to prepare for guerrilla warfare. Comrade Xia was the first to respond, put down the "peace burden," bravely signed up, and insisted on defending the position. He had full confidence that he would not retreat under any circumstances. He said: "There are dangers, but as long as you are willing to risk everything, there may not be any danger, because we have reliable masses." He further clarified: "No one wants to risk everything, but for a revolutionary, it is glorious to die for the Party and the people. Only by thoroughly understanding this principle, actively struggling with the spirit of risking everything, can we seek to preserve everything." This spirit of wholeheartedly serving the Party and the people has already been commended by the Military Sub-district Command. The County Party Committee has called on all cadres in the county to learn from Comrade Xia Shuping.

    分区指挥部传令嘉奖
    濮阳县委组织部长夏树屏同志
    全心全意为党为人民
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】夏树屏同志是濮阳的县委组织部长，虽然不是濮阳人，但已在濮阳生了根。他参加过濮阳的开辟工作，他与敌人作了长期的隐蔽斗争，他亲身领导了群众的大翻身运动。在这次的爱国自卫战争中，他又表现了高尚无比的英勇。他自接到上级号召“干部带头参军”之后，便下决心带领群众参加这次自卫斗争。但由于县委会决定他不能马上离开濮阳，没有参军。自陇海战役开始后，该县出了四次担架，只有第四次因为党有更重要的工作，必须他去作而没有参加，其余三次他都自报奋勇去带领担架。他每次深入到小队中与民夫一起生活，随时解决民夫的问题。尤其是第三次担架成份较复杂，群众情绪不高，他不怕困难，用一切努力，来争取完成任务。他带的牲口自己不用让给病号，他亲自下手抬担架。区村干部在他带领影响之下，都下手抬起来。他并亲自到火线去背彩号。他带的担架队，人人忘掉了自己的疲劳，每夜抬五、六十里不吃饭，还是满劲返回火线。抬第二趟的时候，群众确实又累又饿不愿干了，夏同志响亮的提出：“咱们多出一点汗，受伤同志少流一点血，愿去的跟我来。”不少担架又奋勇跟他去了。群众热爱他，相信他，每付担架都在低声唤：“夏部长跟我们吧！”他很亲切的安慰大家：“我在这里，离得不远”。大家被感动了，终于胜利的完成了任务。上级号召濮阳准备打游击，夏同志首先响应，放下和平包袱，勇敢的报名，坚持阵地，他有充分的信心，任何情况下不退却，他说：“危险是有的，只要舍得下本，也不一定有危险，因为我们有可靠的群众。”他更加明确的说：“本谁也不愿舍，但对一个革命者来说，为党为人民死了是光荣的。只有想透了这个道理，以舍本的精神，积极斗争，求得保本才行。”他这种全心全意为党为人民的精神，除分区指挥部已传令嘉奖外，县委会号召全县干部向夏树屏同志学习。
