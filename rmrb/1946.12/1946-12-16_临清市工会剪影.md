Linqing City Trade Union Glimpses
Xinhua News Agency, Jinnan Branch

        I. No Lihua, No City Trade Union
    After the shop apprentices of Linqing City won the wage increase and clothing struggle in May, in order to consolidate the trade union organization, seek welfare for workers, and improve workers' lives, the Lihua Department Store, representing workers and shop assistants from all walks of life, emerged as the times required. At that time, more than 500 people invested, raising more than 920,000 yuan in capital, making it the store with the most shareholders in Linqing City. The management committee, the shopkeeper, and the staff were all selected and hired by the trade union. In half a year of operation, thanks to the efforts of everyone, the profit was approximately 200%. After Lihua opened, the night soil collectors and shop apprentices all said, "Lihua belongs to us workers!" Whenever workers encountered any difficulties, they would come to Lihua for solutions. Within six months, the Da Zhong Cigarette Factory, Tongzhi Cheng Restaurant, and Gongyi and Gong Xinyi Iron Factories all opened one after another with the support of Lihua. Now, there are plans to combine with rural workers to open a towel factory in the countryside. On the surface, Lihua looks like a business, but in reality, it has become a workers' club. Workers from all walks of life all say, "Lihua is our workers' home. Without Lihua, there would be no trade union."
        II. Whoever's Shop Assistants are in the Trade Union, Their Business Will Thrive
    Senji Tea Shop had three branches when Linqing was liberated, with capital not exceeding 300,000 yuan. Because of losses, the owners were constantly thinking of closing down or dividing the business. Shop assistant Liu Wankang had been an apprentice at the counter since he was fifteen years old, and even now, after twenty-five years, he is still a shop assistant. During this year's shop apprentice movement, because of his active work, he was elected as the vice-chairman of the city trade union. Because he constantly explained the industrial and commercial policies to the owners and head clerks, when the city evaluated the burden, shop assistant Jia Zhensheng felt that the burden of Senji and Tongxingde was unfair. He went to the Chamber of Commerce to reason, advocating that the evaluation should be based on the amount of inventory and daily transactions. As a result, Senji's burden was reduced from 11% to 8%, saving more than 100,000 yuan annually. At this time, the owner realized this and went to Tianjin and Jinan to purchase goods with peace of mind. The shop assistants took care of the affairs at home and in the store. By the end of the year, the estimated profit could be ten times more. Feng Zihe, a shop assistant from Yuanfangzhai Old Sauce Garden, was a member of the trade union standing committee and understood that the mass movement was to eliminate feudalism and not to fight industry and commerce. When the mass movement began, other sauce gardens did not dare to buy radishes and soybeans, but Yuanfangzhai bought them and made a big profit.
        III. Experienced Industrial and Commercial Policies Through Struggle
    On the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, the Linqing Municipal Government issued a notice prohibiting arbitrary dismissal in order to ensure that shop apprentices would not lose their jobs. Tianxiang Grain and Oil Shop manager in Cheying Street, Ju Yuzhai, partly because his business was not very prosperous and partly because he was dissatisfied with the wage increase for shop assistants, deceived his young shop apprentice Shou Kui at the end of the year, saying, "Your father sent a message asking you to go home for the New Year." After Shou Kui left, he immediately sent a letter of dismissal, and at the same time dismissed the old shop assistants to go home for the New Year. Ju Yuzhai then spread rumors saying, "My shop assistants are very lazy, secretly going to restaurants to eat steamed bread and eating only the tender hearts of cabbages and not the leaves." On the sixth day of the first lunar month this year, when the shop assistants went to the winter meeting, Shou Kui complained to the assembly, arousing the indignation of all the workers, who rose up to reason and struggle with Ju Yuzhai. In order to take care of industry and commerce, the trade union only asked Ju Yuzhai to compensate the shop assistants 3,600 yuan for holiday expenses and did not punish him. Merchants throughout the city said: "It is really generous to Ju Yuzhai. The democratic government protects industry and commerce for sure." From then on, the grain and oil shop operated with peace of mind, and in one month this spring, it made a profit of 100%.
        IV. Guo Sixth Brother Chuckles
    Guo Sixth Brother is fifty-seven years old this year. He has been cooking, grinding, and feeding livestock at the Dehe Wood Factory in Zhugan Lane for thirty-two years, but he could not afford a cotton robe. Last year, when wages were increased and clothing was provided, the shopkeeper bought him a tattered fur coat. Guo Sixth Brother was so happy that he told everyone he met, "I actually wore a fur coat since the trade union was established." Then, recalling his personal hardships, he said, "In the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, I bought a cotton robe, but because I was sick and had no money to buy medicine, I sold the cotton robe again." When the reporter asked him about his recent living conditions, he said, "Last year, I used the 10,000 yuan from the wage increase to buy shares, and this year I received a dividend of 20,000 yuan. I bought wheat and stored it. Now I have food and clothing." He also said happily, "In the past, the young shopkeepers called me Guo Liu, but now they all call me Uncle Guo Liu. Even the black market mayor called me Guo Sixth Brother at the meeting." On the announcement to citizens commemorating the first anniversary of the liberation of Linqing City, there was a passage about Guo Liu having a cotton robe. He put that leaflet in his money box and carried it with him every day, taking it out from time to time to peek at it and chuckle.

　　临清市工会剪影
    新华社冀南分社
        一、没有利华就没有市工会
    临清市的工店徒弟们，于五月间增资增衣斗争胜利后，为了巩固工会组织，为工人谋福利，改善工人生活，代表各行各业工人店员的利华百货商店，即应运的产生了。当时有五百多人入股，召集股金九十二万多元，是临清市股东最多的一个商店。经理委员会，掌柜和先生都是由工会里选拔与聘请的。在半年的经营中，由于全体的努力，约计得红利百分之二百。利华开幕后，粪夫们、工店徒们都说：“利华是我们工人的啊！”工人们发生了任何困难，都来找利华解决，半年当中，大中卷烟厂、同志成饭馆、公益、公新益铁工厂，在利华的扶持下，都先后开了张。现正计划与农村工人结合，在乡里开毛巾工厂。利华从表面上看来是个商号，实际上却成了工人的俱乐部，各行各业的工人们，都这样说：“利华是我们工人的家，没利华就没工会了。”
            二、谁家的店员在工会谁家的买卖就发财
    森记茶庄，在解放临清时有三个分号，资金不超过三十万元，因为赔钱不能维持，东家们天天想法关门或分家。店员刘万康从十五岁起就在柜上学徒，直到现在二十五年了，还是个店员，在今年工店徒运动中，由于积极工作，被选为市工会副主任，由于他不断的给东家、撑柜的讲解工商业政策，所以当全市评议负担时，店员贾振升觉得森记与同兴德的负担不公，他便到商会里去讲理，主张按存货多寡与每天交易来评议，结果森记的负担由百分之十一减少到百分之八，每年可节余十余万元。这时东家觉悟了，才放宽心的去到天津济南办货，家里的事亦商店员们去办，到年底约计能得红利十倍。远芳斋老酱园的店员冯子和，因是工会常委，明白市民运动是消灭封建，不斗工商业。当群运开始时别家酱园不敢买箩卜、黄豆，远芳斋买了结果盈利很大。
            三、从斗争中体验了工商业政策
    去年腊月三十日，临清市政府为了保证工店徒不失业，曾布告禁止随便解释。车营街天祥花粮店经理、雎玉斋一来因买卖不很发财，二来对店员增资不满，年底时便欺骗他的小店徒寿魁说：“你父亲捎信来叫你回家过年去。”待寿魁走后，马上就寄去解释的信，同时把老店员也辞回去过年，雎玉斋随即造谣说：“我家店员非常懒，净偷着下馆子吃闷饼，吃白菜光吃嫩心不吃帮。”今年正月初六日，店员们去冬开会时，寿魁向大会诉苦，引起全体工人的义愤，便群起向雎玉斋进行了说理斗争。工会为了照顾工商业，只叫雎玉斋赔偿店员过节费三千六百元，并未予以处罚。全市商人说：对雎玉斋真宽大，民主的政府保护工商业是确实的。”从此该花粮店安心营业，今春一个月内即得红利百分之百。
            四、郭六哥偷笑
    郭六哥今年五十七岁了，在竹竿巷德和木厂作饭、推磨、喂牲口，一直干了三十二年也买不起一件棉袍；去年增资增衣时，掌柜的给他买了一件破皮袄，喜的郭六哥见人就说：“从成立了工会居然穿上皮袄了。”接着回想起个人的苦处来，他说：“民国三十一年我买过一件棉袍，因生病没钱买药，结果又把棉袍卖了。”当记者询问他最近的生活情况时，他说：“去年增资得了一万元入了股，今年就分得红利两万元。我又买成麦子存放起来，现在是有吃有穿。”他又很高兴的说：“从前小掌柜的都喊我郭六，现在都称我郭六叔了，连黑市长在会上也称我郭六哥。”临清市解放周年纪念告市民书上，曾写着郭六有棉袍的一段话，他把那个传单放在钱盒里，天天随身带着，不时的拿出来偷看着笑。
