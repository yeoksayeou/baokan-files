[This dispatch] From our newspaper, Weixian, 20th. According to a report from the Jinnan Branch of the Xinhua News Agency: Two-thirds of the counties in Jinnan have successfully completed land reform. More than four million farmers have obtained land. The Party and the masses in the entire district are continuing to promote this movement with all their strength. The Jinnan District Party Committee has gone to the countryside separately to personally guide the in-depth work of the movement, in order to complete all land reform before next year's spring plowing. After the District Party Committee proposed full support for the mass movement at the end of August, the anti-traitor and grievance-telling movement in the new districts quickly unfolded. Over the course of three months, more than 4,000 villages in more than 20 counties (some of which were new districts), including Yongzhi, Enxian, Chengci, Ningnan, and Jixian, overthrew the brutal rule of traitors, bullies, and landlords, and recovered the land and property they had plundered and exploited. The grievances of the peasants were redressed. During the movement, mass leaders who had close ties with the people emerged, such as Gao Fengkui in Enxia District. In the two-month "Turning Over" (翻身) general inspection movement, farmers in more than ten counties in the old districts of Yuanchao, Jize, Guantao, Guanxian, Qinghe, Longping, and Renxian thoroughly liquidated the past omissions and remaining feudal oppression and feudal exploitation, greatly eliminating the extremely poor and poor peasants. For example, farmers in Yuanchao recovered more than 40,000 mu of land, 5,800 houses, and more than 1,000 courtyards. Farmers in Jize recovered more than 30,000 mu of land and more than 9,000 houses. Farmers in Renxian recovered 40,896 mu of land and 10,200 houses, and surrendered more than 180 long and short guns from feudal armed forces. The above-mentioned new and old districts, totaling more than 4 million farmers, have obtained land, houses, and means of production. In other old districts, such as Linqing, Nangong, and Zaoqiang, the movement has also begun and will be quickly completed before next year's spring plowing. "Turning Over" teams that help the masses in the new districts are now marching towards the old districts, blank areas, and backward areas. In the marginal areas of Gaotang, Pingyuan, and Linzhang, under the slogan of "Pick up your guns, fight the enemy, and turn over!" (闹翻身), cadres and armed work teams, combined with local militia, are fighting against the harassment of the stubborn and puppet troops on the one hand, and leading the peasants to carry out the "Turning Over" struggle on the other. The broad masses of peasants are recovering their land from traitors, secret agents, bullies, and landlords. Due to land reform, the peasants' production enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly increased. The winter sideline production movement has gradually unfolded. For example, the seventh district of Yuanchao organized 32 oil mills and more than 20 ginned cotton ginning carts, working day and night non-stop. In Beixiaozhang, more than 72 of the 90-plus households have participated in the timber factory mutual aid group. Huanggu Village in Jize organized 48 mutual aid groups, engaged in cotton ginning, transportation, and the establishment of timber factory cooperatives. Forty-three textile groups in Haodong Village wove 20 bolts of white cloth and earned 50,000 yuan. The broad masses of farmers in Weixian have obtained land and capital. In the Shaogu area, the weaving industry in nearly 20 villages has developed unprecedentedly. The number of towel machines and looms has increased from 1,000 before the incident to more than 3,000 currently, producing more than 4,000 dozen towels and 400 bolts of printed cloth per day. The peasants who have "Turned Over" are preparing to carry out next year's production movement with unparalleled enthusiasm. After the peasants obtained land, their awareness has been unprecedentedly improved. They all understand that the Communist Party is their savior and benefactor, and they are determined to follow the Communist Party. Chiang Kai-shek is the root of traitors, bullies, and landlords, and is a butcher who slaughters the people. When Chiang Kai-shek launched an attack on the liberated areas, the peasants of Jinnan rushed to the front one after another, totaling ×10,000 people. At this time when Chiang's army is attacking Jinnan, 200,000 militiamen and hundreds of thousands of self-defense forces are now training hard, preparing to launch guerrilla warfare to defend their land and defend their homeland.

　　冀南区党委亲自下乡指导工作
    争取今冬完成土地改革
    三分之二地区工作胜利结束转入生产
    现正集中全力开展落后及边沿区斗争
    【本报威县二十日电】据新华社冀南分社记者报导：冀南三分之二的县分已胜利完成土地改革，四百余万农民已获得土地，全区党与群众正以全力继续推进这一运动，冀南区党委并已分头下乡，亲自指导运动的深入工作，以争取明年春耕前全部完成土地改革。八月末区党委提出全力支持群运后，新区的反奸诉苦运动迅速展开，历时三月，新区永智、恩县、成磁、宁南、冀县等二十余县（有的部分是新区）计有四千余村庄，打垮汉奸、恶霸、地主的残暴统治，追回他们掠夺剥削的土地和财物，农民的冤仇得以伸雪，在运动中涌现了与人民群众有密切联系的群众领袖，如恩夏沙区的高凤魁。两月翻身大检查运动，老区元朝、鸡泽、馆陶、冠县、清河、隆平、任县等十余县广的农民，对过去遗漏及残存的封建压迫与封建剥削作了彻底的清算，大量的消灭了赤贫与贫农，如元朝农民追回土地四万余亩，房五千八百间，场院千余亩。鸡泽农民追回土地三万多亩，房屋九千多间，任县农民追回土地四万零八百九十六亩，房屋一万零二百间，缴出封建武装长短枪一百八十余枝。以上新老区约计四百多万农民，获得土地、房屋和生产工具。在其他老区如临清、南宫、枣强等十余县，运动亦已开始，将于明年春耕前迅速完成土地改革。在新区帮助群众翻身的翻身队，现正纷纷向老区及空白区、落后区进军。高唐、平原、临漳等边沿区，在“拿起枪来，打敌人、闹翻身”的口号下，干部武工队结合当地民兵，一面打击顽伪的出扰，一面领导农民进行翻身斗争。广大农民正从汉奸、特务、恶霸、地主手里收回自己的土地。由于经过土地改革，农民的生产热情空前提高，冬季副业生产运动，已逐渐开展，如元朝七区组织了卅二座油房，二十多个轧车洋弓日夜不停的生产，北小丈九十多户人家，已有七十二户参加木料厂互助组。鸡泽黄沟村组织了四十八个互助组，轧花、运输、开办木料厂合作社，浩东村四十三个纺织组，织出白布二十匹，赚洋五万元。威县广大农民获得土地和资本，邵固一带近二十个村庄纺织业空前发展，毛巾机，织布机，由事变前一千架增至目前三千余架，日出毛巾四千余打，花布四百匹。翻身的农民，正以无比的热情，准备开展明年的生产运动。农民获得土地后，觉悟空前提高，都明白了共产党是自己的救星恩人，坚决跟着共产党走。蒋介石是汉奸恶霸地主的根，是屠杀人民的刽子手。当蒋介石向解放区进攻时，冀南农民纷纷奔赴前线，前后共达×万人。当此蒋军进攻冀南之时，二十万民兵，数十万自卫队，现正紧张练武，准备开展游击战，保卫土地、保卫家乡。
