Wang Guo'an, Heroic Defender of the Homeland

Dongjiu Temple Village, on the edge of Tangyin County, is separated from the Chiang Kai-shek puppet stronghold of Wu's Hollow by only an earthen ridge. The villagers can clearly hear the puppet soldiers talking, yet the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army dares not casually intrude. Dongjiu Temple has become a fortress for anti-enemy struggle on the edge of Tangyin. Driven by the influence of this village, guerrilla warfare has spread everywhere in the surrounding villages. At the "September 2nd" militia review, the Dongjiu Temple militia won first prize. All villages have set Dongjiu Temple as the standard for competition. The Dongjiu Temple militia is led by Wang Guo'an, a combat hero of the village.

In April of this year, under the threat of the puppet army, the Dongjiu Temple militia was established with difficulty. Initially, there were only seven militiamen with ten earthen guns, but within ten days, the puppet army found out. One day around noon, dozens of puppet soldiers climbed Dong Ridge, intending to annihilate this newly formed militia. The situation was extremely urgent. Wang Guo'an quickly ordered a militiaman to hide near the village and told him, "When the enemy comes down, aim carefully and fire resolutely." He then led the other six men, dividing them into three groups, and deployed them on the east, north, and south sides of the earthen ridge to launch a cold-gun battle. Immediately, gunfire erupted from all directions, and the flustered puppet soldiers had to drag their wounded away. But the enemy was not discouraged. When they came again for the second time in the afternoon, the village had been completely evacuated. Wang Guo'an's militia team immediately conducted a counter-encirclement surveillance outside the village. Militiamen from the surrounding villages rushed to the scene, and Wang Guo'an led them in an attack on Wu's Hollow. By the time the puppet soldiers heard the news and rushed back in panic, they had already killed one enemy and returned in triumph. After several battles, Wang Guo'an experienced the power of the guerrilla war's elusive tactics.

Wu's Hollow was garrisoned by the puppet security 4th Regiment, led by Hu Quanlu, originally a notorious bandit in northern Henan. They certainly didn't take this group of "soft rabbits" (as they called the Dongjiu Temple militia) seriously, but this militia dared to attack their lair in Wu's Hollow and even killed an enemy. This was intolerable. To restore their prestige, in June, they presented heavy gifts to secure the cooperation of the Chiang Kai-shek army's 30th Army, proposing the slogan "Crush Dongjiu Temple in three days" to launch an attack. This put Dongjiu Temple on high alert. But Wang Guo'an remained calm. He encouraged everyone, saying, "Can we live like Ying'er Village? The enemy burned 250 mu of wheat in Ying'er Village and looted 50 dan of grain. Let's use this to buy bullets and fight these dog bastards. We can't be like Ying'er Village, taking a beating with our pants down. We will defend Dongjiu Temple to the death!" The militiamen excitedly spat out their words, "Right! Defend Dongjiu Temple to the death!" The next day, Chiang Kai-shek's puppets, with a battalion of troops, carrying small cannons and light and heavy machine guns, stormed Dongjiu Temple. The Dongjiu Temple militia concentrated in the woods east of the village. The enemy fired intense machine-gun bursts from the ridge towards the woods. Wang Guo'an calmly directed the militiamen to find good positions, disperse, and lie in ambush, not wasting shots, but concentrating their fire on the enemy's exposed positions. Thus, as soon as the enemy poked their heads out, they were driven back. The enemy sent plainclothes scouts, who were captured by militiamen hidden by the roadside. By evening, they had no choice but to retreat. The next day, Chiang Kai-shek's puppets came again, engaging our reinforcements in a day-long battle, and once again dejectedly carried back several wounded soldiers. On the third day, the demoralized enemy had to come again to fulfill the "Crush Dongjiu Temple in three days" slogan, but halfway there, a certain company commander of the 30th Army was shot and killed by a cold-gun. When the enemy reached the ridge, the militia's cold-gun battle unfolded again. The listless enemy looked westward, sighed several times, and retreated to their lair. The people of Dongjiu Temple laughed loudly, happily saying, "Looking west, there is a cloud of yellow smoke; it is all from Wang Guo'an's rifles and grenades." From then on, this became a laughing stock.

Up to now, in more than five months, the Dongjiu Temple Wang Guo'an militia team has repelled more than 90 enemy attacks and harassments. Chiang Kai-shek's puppet army has suffered fifteen casualties, with one captured. Wang Guo'an and his comrades are still guarding Dongjiu Temple. They have not only suffered no casualties, but have also learned sparrow warfare and landmine warfare. Most of the ten earthen guns have become steel rifles.

Wang Guo'an, this 28-year-old liberated peasant, had lived a life of poverty since the age of thirteen, fleeing famine to Xuzhou, working in coal mines, and doing hard labor outside. This March, he finally recovered 22 mu of land. As soon as the village militia was organized, he was elected as the instructor. During the tense period in May, he stayed on guard every night until dawn, only resting a little after the militiamen had all gotten up. In battle, he was always at the front, using his own bravery as a model to unite and educate the militiamen. Once, because the guard duty order was messed up, the militiamen argued and were unwilling to go. Wang Guo'an shouldered his gun and went on guard. The arguing militiamen regretted it and vied to take his place and bring him back. In the early days of the newly liberated areas, many militias had the phenomenon of becoming detached from the masses. Wang Guo'an often told the militiamen in casual conversations, "When you carry a gun, you should pay more attention to speaking kindly. Don't forget that we are the militia, we are defending our homeland. Even if you carry a gun, don't forget your roots, don't be special."

　　保乡英雄王国安
    汤阴边地东酒寺村，与蒋伪据点吴家凹，只隔一条土岭，伪军的哨兵说话，村人可听得清清楚楚，但蒋伪军却不敢随便闯进，东酒寺已成为汤阴边沿对敌斗争堡垒。在该村影响推动下，边沿村到处展开了游击战。“九二”民兵检阅会上，东酒寺民兵得了头奖，各村都以东酒寺为标准提出竞赛，东酒寺民兵就是该村战斗英雄王国安所领导的。
    今年四月，在伪军威胁下，东酒寺民兵艰难的成立起来。最初只七个民兵，有十支土枪，但不到十天，伪军知道了。一天的半晌午伪军数十人爬上了东岭，要来歼灭这初建的民兵。情况万分紧急。王国安很快命令一个民兵隐蔽在村边，告诉他：“敌人往下走，瞄准了坚决打。”自己就带领六个人分作三股，分布到土岭的东南北三面，展开冷枪战，一时枪声四起，张惶的伪军只好拖上挂彩的人跑了。但敌人没死心，下午二次再来时，村中已完全撤退，王国安民兵队即在村外来了个反包围的监视。周围各村民兵赶到，王国安便带领他们袭入吴家凹，等到伪军闻讯张惶奔回时，他们已打死一个敌人，凯旋而返了。经过几次的战斗后，王国安体验到游击战的神出鬼没战术的威力。
    吴家凹驻着伪保安四团扈全禄部，原是豫北有名的惯匪，他们眼里确乎没有这伙“毛兔子”（他们这样骂东酒寺民兵），但这伙民兵敢到他们的老窝吴家凹去袭击，而且还打死了敌人，这还了得。他们为恢复自己的威风，六月，以重礼请得蒋军的三十军的配合，提出“三天打垮东酒寺”的口号来进攻。这样东酒寺紧张起来了。王国安却镇静，他鼓励大家说：“像营儿村那样还能过吗？敌人到营儿村烧了二百五十亩麦子，又抢走五十石，有这些咱们买上子弹打狗杂种罢，咱们不能学营儿村脱了裤子挨打，咱们死也要守住东酒寺！”民兵们激动地嘴里飞着唾沫：“对！誓死保卫东酒寺！”次日蒋伪以一营的兵力，带小炮轻重机枪直扑东酒寺。东酒寺的民兵集中在村东的树林里。敌人在岭上向树林以机枪密集的扫射，王国安沉着的指挥着民兵，找好地形分散伏下，不放闲枪，集中地射击敌人突出的一点。这样，敌人刚一露头便被打回去。敌人派下便衣侦探，又被隐蔽在路边的民兵俘虏了，傍晚只得回去。第二天蒋伪再来，与我们的援兵对战一日，又垂头丧气地抬回了几个伤兵。第三天，士气低落的敌人，不得不再来应付一下“三天打垮东酒寺”的口号，但半途中三十军的某连长就被冷枪击中毙命。当敌人上到岭上时，民兵的冷枪战又展开了。无精打采的敌人向西望了一下，长叹几声退回老巢。东酒寺的老百姓大笑起来，他们高兴地说：“往西看黄烟一片，都是王国安的步枪手榴弹。”从此传为笑谈。
    直到现在，五个多月的时间，东酒寺王国安民兵队打退了敌人九十多次进攻和袭扰。蒋伪军前后伤亡已十五人，被俘一人。王国安和他的战友们却依旧拱卫着东酒寺。他们不仅没有伤亡，相反学会麻雀战与地雷战，十支土枪大部已成了钢枪。
    王国安这个二十八岁的翻身农民，从十三岁起就过着穷困的生活，逃荒到徐州，下过煤窑，在外面作过苦工，今年三月才收回二十二亩土地，该村民兵一组织起来他就被选为指导员。当五月紧张的时候，他夜夜坐岗到鸡叫，等民兵们都起了床自己才稍休息一下。作起战来他总在前面，以自己的勇敢模范作用来团结、教育民兵。一次因站岗的次序乱了，民兵们争吵着都不愿去，王国安就扛上枪站岗去了，这样争吵的民兵都后悔起来，又争着站岗把他换回来。新解放区最初组织起来的民兵，多有脱离群众的现象，王国安常从闲谈中向民兵说：“背起枪来更要注意说话和气，不要忘记咱们是民兵，是保卫家乡的，谁背了枪也不要忘了本，不要特殊”。
