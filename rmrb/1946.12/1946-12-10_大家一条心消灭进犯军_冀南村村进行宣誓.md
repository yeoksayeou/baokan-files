　　Villages Throughout Southern Hebei Take Oaths to Eliminate the Invading Army with One Heart
　　[Our newspaper, Weixian, 8th dispatch] Under the slogan of "Defending the Land," liberated peasants in Southern Hebei are holding oath-taking ceremonies in every village, determined to wipe out the invading army on the land they invade. At the oath-taking rally of more than a thousand people in Beigaoji, Second District of Weixian County, Zhao Shuxiang, director of the Joint Defense, first said to the masses: "If Chiang Kai-shek attacks, I will never rest until I lead everyone to resolutely eliminate them." All the members of the peasant association then proposed: "We guarantee to automatically go to the front line to carry stretchers, deliver bullets, and help the army fight." More than a hundred militiamen said: "When Old Chiang comes, we will definitely cooperate with the regular army to fight guerrilla warfare and lay landmines everywhere, so that the enemy will be afraid to sleep and afraid to walk, and finally die in the liberated areas." An old lady from Dayan Village, Second District, said at the oath-taking rally: "You carry guns to fight Old Chiang, I guarantee my son will follow you, and my mother-in-law and I will definitely save money and work hard in the rear to produce, and fight Old Chiang together!" More than 160 cadres from the Eighth District of Wuxun gathered to take an oath and make a pact, vowing never to compromise or surrender. Li Yuhai, the self-defense captain of Nancheng Gu in Qizhi County, said in his oath that he was determined to study bayonet fighting, shooting, grenade throwing, and explosions, and prepare to lead the whole village to carry out martial arts exercises. After taking the oath, all the teachers and students of Daming Taichen Middle School quickly went to the countryside to carry out ideological education for the masses and strengthen combat readiness. All the students of the Ninth Military Sub-district militia training team, with a solemn attitude, faced Chairman Mao's portrait and shouted: "We are the armed forces of the liberated peasants, we swear to do good deeds for the masses, fight the big and small Old Chiang to the end, and resolutely defend you!" After taking the oath, everyone scrambled to sign and put their fingerprints on the pledge, filled with confidence and determination, and struggled for the victory of full resistance.
　　[Our newspaper, Weixian, 4th dispatch] Five thousand liberated peasants in the Mafang District of Ningnan gathered to take an oath, vowing to fight Chiang Kai-shek, who brought disaster to the country and the people, and defend Chairman Mao, their savior. The director of the district said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have been completely liberated. All sixty-seven extremely poor households in the nine villages have risen; the families of revolutionary martyrs in each village have received more than three mu of land. This land was obtained through our struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao." The director of the district peasant association proposed: "To defend Chairman Mao, we must do three major tasks: first, prepare for war, produce, and save money to prepare for the spring famine next year. Second, consolidate the organization and strengthen the internal unity of the peasant association. Third, after the peasants have been liberated, they must help women to be liberated and establish a new society." His proposal was unanimously adopted on the spot. The militia instructor of the district proposed that the militia establish a joint defense to suppress secret agents and defend the fruits of liberation. The women's representative said: "Our women's oppression is all the fault of Old Chiang." In the afternoon, a parade began, with Yangko teams, martial arts teams, dances and other performances from various villages, and the masses were extremely excited.
