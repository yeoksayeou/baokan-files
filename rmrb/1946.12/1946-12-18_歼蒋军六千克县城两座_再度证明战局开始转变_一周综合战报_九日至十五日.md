　　Annihilating 6,000 Chiang Troops and Liberating Two County Towns
    Further Proves the Turning Point in the War Situation
    Weekly Comprehensive War Report
    9th to 15th
    This week, Chiang Kai-shek's troops continued to invade our People's Liberation Army. At the temporary cost of losing three county towns (Qingfeng, Neihuang, and Jiyuan), they were annihilated more than 6,000 Chiang troops, and recovered two county towns (Yuanqu and Zhongyang). This once again shows that the war situation has begun to shift in our favor.
    In western Shanxi: The Lüliang Eighth Route Army carried out self-defense and liberated Zhongyang, capturing more than 1,600 Yan troops including Yan's deputy division commander Zhang Jugan and killing and wounding more than 200 people. From now on, the two liberated areas of southwestern Shanxi and northwestern Shanxi have been connected.
    In the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia area: Last week, Chiang Kai-shek's Hu Zongnan troops invaded the Guanzhong Division. On the 10th, they were repelled by the Eighth Route Army, and Liulin Town and other places they occupied have been recovered. Although Hu's troops continued to move into the northwest of Malan and the southeast of Jiang County, they have all been defeated under the brave resistance of our army and civilians.
    In the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area: The Taiyue Eighth Route Army recovered Yuanqu on the 8th, annihilating more than 1,000 invading Chiang troops, and controlled the Jiang (County) Yuan (Qu) highway, which will have a very positive impact on the entire southern Shanxi war situation. Chiang Kai-shek's troops in northern Henan re-occupied Jiyuan on the 3rd, and Chiang Kai-shek's troops north of Puyang occupied Qingfeng and Neihuang on the 8th and 10th, but the Taihang Eighth Route Army has taken the initiative to carry out self-defense attacks on the Anyang-Tangyin section of the Pinghan Road, annihilating more than 700 enemies, severely undermining Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to pinch Daming from the east and west with troops from Qingfeng and Neihuang.
    In northern Jiangsu: After 6,000 Chiang troops were annihilated on the southern line of Yancheng, they launched another attack on the Lianshui-Shuyang area with ten regiments on the 12th. The New Fourth Army calmly resisted, and on the 14th, they had annihilated more than 600 people on the southwest line of Lianshui. The local armed forces and militia active behind enemy lines have recently recovered Chahe, an important town southwest of Huai'an. The militia in southern Shandong, also cooperated with the New Fourth Army to recover Xiazhen once on the 6th, killing and capturing more than 900 Chiang troops.
    In Chahar-Suiyuan: After the Eighth Route Army withdrew from Zhangyuan, they repeatedly defeated the invading Chiang-Fu troops in the vast rural areas. Following the annihilation of more than 800 invading Fu troops in Zhaochuan Fort, Xuanhua, on the 11th of last month, they eliminated 700 soldiers from the 6th Cavalry Division of Fu's army in Chongli County, northeast of Zhangjiakou, on the 9th of this month. The working teams active behind Fu's troops once attacked Fengzhen City on the 16th of last month. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　歼蒋军六千克县城两座
    再度证明战局开始转变
    一周综合战报
    九日至十五日
    本周内各线蒋军继续进犯我人民解放军，以暂时的失掉县城三座（清丰、内黄、济源）的代价歼灭蒋军六千余人，并收复县城两座（垣曲、中阳），这再度说明了战局已开始作有利于我的转变。
    晋西方面：吕梁八路军进行自卫及解放中阳，生俘阎军副师长张居乾以下一千六百余人，毙伤二百余人。从此晋西南和晋西北两解放区已连成一片。
    陕甘宁方面：上周蒋军胡宗南部进犯关中分区，于十日为八路军击退，其所侵占的柳林镇等地已告收复。尽管胡部仍在马栏西北以及绛县东南不断窜犯，但在我军民奋勇抗击下，均已溃退。
    晋冀鲁豫方面：太岳八路军于八日收复垣曲，歼灭进犯蒋军一千余人，控制了绛（县）垣（曲）公路，对整个晋南战局对我将产生极有利的影响。豫北蒋军于三日再陷济源，濮阳以北蒋军于八日及十日侵占清丰与内黄，但太行八路军已在平汉路安阳汤阴段主动地进行自卫出击，歼敌七百余人，对清丰、内黄蒋军东西钳击大名的企图予以严重的打击。
    苏北方面：蒋军在盐城南线被歼六千人后，十二日起又以十个团兵力进犯涟水沭阳地区。新四军沉着迎击，十四日已在涟水西南一线歼其六百余人。而活跃在敌后的地方武装和民兵，已于最近收复了淮安西南的重镇岔河。鲁南的民兵，亦于六日配合新四军一度收复夏镇，毙俘蒋军九百余。
    察绥方面：八路军撤离张垣后，即在广大农村屡挫进犯蒋傅军。继上月十一日于宣化赵川堡歼灭进犯傅军一部八百余人后，又于本月九日在张家口东北崇礼县消灭傅军骑六师七百余人。而活跃于傅军后方的武工队，于上月十六日一度袭入丰镇城内。（新华社）
