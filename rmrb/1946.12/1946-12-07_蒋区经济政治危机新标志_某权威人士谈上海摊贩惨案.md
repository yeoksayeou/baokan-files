Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 4th: According to an authoritative figure newly arrived in Yan'an from Shanghai, the large-scale massacre of hawkers that began in Shanghai on November 30th is not an isolated incident in Shanghai. Rather, it is a new sign of the economic and political crisis under Chiang Kai-shek's rule.

Why does the Chiang Kai-shek government want to eliminate hawkers? Their excuse is, of course, "tidying up the city appearance." In reality, this is a manifestation of the increasingly ferocious and brutal economic policies of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families amidst the deepening economic crisis. Chiang Kai-shek's rule has made most people poorer day by day. Many people no longer have the ability to buy expensive goods from the large companies and department stores controlled by the Four Families. As a result, everyone has turned to buying cheaper goods from hawkers. Therefore, the hawker business in Shanghai has become unprecedentedly prosperous, while the business of large companies and department stores has become deserted. The Four Families do not want to save the bankrupt social economy by changing their reactionary rule. Instead, they hate the hawkers, believing that the hawkers have seized their market, and attempt to eliminate the hawkers to maintain the sales of large companies and department stores.

Now, Shanghai hawkers are already an important factor in Shanghai society. The vast majority of middle and lower-class people rely on hawkers to buy daily necessities, and the number of hawkers is also exceptionally large (although there are no precise statistics). The sources of hawkers are roughly: (1) bankrupt or semi-bankrupt small and medium-sized merchants, (2) urban poor, (3) unemployed or semi-employed clerks and shop assistants.

Unemployed or semi-employed workers had already begun this activity in the form of "running danbang" (i.e., peddling in various cities as travelers) during the Japanese rule of Shanghai due to the economic decline of the vast majority of the people. After the "takeover" by the Chiang government in Shanghai, the economic crisis has become even greater in the past year, and there are even more hawkers.

The goods sold by hawkers are generally daily necessities. The most important sources are: first, American goods smuggled in by the US military; second, grain and other items; third, enemy and puppet materials privately sold by corrupt "takeover" officials; fourth, goods remaining from bankrupt and semi-bankrupt factories and stores; and fifth, second-hand goods sold by bankrupt families.

Judging from the purchasers, hawkers, and the source of materials, hawker business will only increase and not decrease before the reactionary rule of the Chiang government ends. The Chiang government will not be able to prohibit it no matter what.

The Chiang government began cracking down on hawkers in Shanghai in the spring of this year. At first, the hawkers concentrated their business, but the police drove them away. So the hawkers adopted a decentralized approach and went to various streets and alleys to do business separately. Later, the police came to ban them again. So many hawkers turned to a more concealed method. They took out their goods to sell where there were no police, and immediately packed them up when they saw the police coming. This large-scale arrest and subsequent mass killing of hawkers is a further and more barbaric means.

The people are so poor that they cannot live, and they want to maintain their reactionary rule by means of physical elimination, which will inevitably backfire. This is the common view of neutral observers in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign.

　　蒋区经济政治危机新标志
  　某权威人士谈上海摊贩惨案
    【新华社延安四日电】据新由上海来延的某权威人士谈，上海自上月三十日起发生之屠杀摊贩大惨案，不是上海一地的偶然事件，而是蒋介石统治下经济危机和政治危机的新标志。
    蒋介石政府为什么要消灭摊贩，他们的借口当然是“整顿市容”，实际上这是蒋宋孔陈四大家族在经济危机加深中更凶恶残暴的经济政策的表现。蒋介石的统治弄得大多数人一天比一天更穷了，很多人已经没有能力到四大家控制下的大公司大商店去买贵东西，于是大家转而向摊贩买便宜货，因此在上海的摊贩营业变成空前的繁荣，而大公司大商店的生意就冷落起来。四大家族不想从改变自己反动统治中来挽救社会经济的破产，反而仇恨摊贩，认为摊贩抢夺了他们的市场，企图消灭了摊贩来保持大公司大商店的销路。
    现在上海摊贩已经是上海社会生活中一个重要的因素，广大中下层群众靠摊贩购买日用品，而摊贩的人数也异常庞大（虽然没有精确的统计）。摊贩的来源大体上有：（一）破产或半破产的中小商人，（二）城市贫民，（三）失业或半失业的职店员。
    失业或半失业的工人，日本统治上海时代即已因广大人民经济没落以“跑单帮”的形式（即以旅客形式奔走各城市之小贩）开始了这样的活动。上海经过蒋政府的“劫收”，一年来经济危机更大了，摊贩也就更多了。
    摊贩所售的货物一般为日用品，最主要者有下列几种来源：一为美军武装走私的美国货，二为粮食等，三为“劫收”贪污者私卖出来的敌伪物资，四为破产与半破产的工厂商店余存的货物，五为破产家庭出售的旧货。
    从购买者摊贩以及物资的来源看，在蒋政府反动统治没有终止以前，摊贩营业只有增加，不会减少，蒋政府无论如何禁止不了的。
    蒋政府在上海取缔摊贩，从今年春季已经开始，摊贩们最初是集中营业，警察把他们赶走，于是摊贩们就采取分散经营办法，到各街各巷分别去作生意，后来警察又来取缔，于是许多摊贩转入比较隐蔽的办法，在没有警察地方就拿货出来叫卖，看到警察来了立即收拾起来。这一次大批逮捕以及以后大量屠杀摊贩是更进一步也是更野蛮的手段了。
    人民穷得不能活了，要用肉体消灭办法来维持反动统治，结果必得其反。这是上海中外中立观察家共同的看法。
