Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 9th: London dispatch: Britain is trying to reduce American imports into Britain. Dalton appealed to the whole country on the 7th to increase production, especially agricultural production, in order to reduce imports and increase exports, saying, "Unless we can reduce our dollar debt, we must try our best not to use many urgently needed items." Furthermore, according to a delayed Reuters report, American industrialists are gradually realizing that the world market has been gaining ground by Britain and several European countries. The New York Business Week felt shocked in October when Britain took the lead in receiving the profitable orders that were formerly received by the United States. The magazine pointed out that Britain has a plan to dominate the world market, and also pointed out the facts such as France's holding of an international aviation exposition and Switzerland's seizure of the pre-war German market, in order to alert the American business community, implying that American goods will face fierce competition from Britain. Britain has been working hard to restore its massive losses due to the war, and is particularly actively expanding exports. The export volume in the first three quarters of this year exceeded the annual level of 1939. It is estimated that the total exports for this year will be four billion U.S. dollars, at least 75 percent more than before the war. This number was the goal pursued by the British Labor government shortly after the Japanese surrender, and its completion was earlier than generally expected. It is no coincidence that American capitalists have expressed shock at this. The number of workers employed in the British export industry has increased by 45 percent compared to before the war.

    唯恐不能独霸市场
    美资本家惧英恢复生产
    【新华社延安九日电】伦敦讯：英国正力图减少美对英输入。达尔顿于七日号召全国增加生产，特别是农业生产，以便减少输入，增加输出，并说：“除非我们能减少我们的美元债务，我们必须尽力不用许多迫切需要的物品。”又据路透社迟到消息：美国实业家渐觉世界市场已由英国及若干欧洲国家抢占上风。纽约实业周报于十月间对于英国抢先接得素由美国所接之厚利定货，感觉震惊。该杂志指出英国有雄霸世界市场之计划，复指出法国之举行国际航空博览会及瑞士之夺取战前德国之市场等事实，以警惕美国实业界，暗示美国货物将对英国进行激烈竞争。按英国战后埋头恢复其因战争之大量损失，特别积极扩大输出，本年头三季输出超过一九三九年全年水平。据估计今年全年输出将为四十亿美元，至少比战前增加百分之七十五。此数目为英工党政府日本投降后不久所追逐之目标，其完成实较一般预料为早。美国资本家对此表示震惊实非偶然，现英国输出工业雇用之工人较战前增加百分之四十五。
