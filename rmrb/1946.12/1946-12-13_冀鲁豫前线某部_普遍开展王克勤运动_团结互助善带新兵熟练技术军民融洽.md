    Jiluyu Frontline Press Corps, 11th dispatch: A certain unit on the Jiluyu Patriotic Self-Defense Front has widely launched the Wang Keqin Movement. The unit's song and dance troupe has collectively created a six-act opera "Wang Keqin," which will soon be performed for various units on the front lines. The main characteristics of the Wang Keqin Squad are: (1) Unity and mutual assistance, good at leading new recruits; (2) Proficiency in military skills; (3) Harmonious relations between the military and the people. Wang Keqin was promoted to deputy platoon leader during the Longfeng Campaign and implemented his excellent leadership style throughout the platoon. Once, a landlord was initially reluctant to let them stay in the house. Seeing Wang Keqin and the soldiers being so amiable and cheerful all day long, they voluntarily helped the landlord with odd jobs and told the old landlady stories about Chiang Kai-shek. The old landlady was extremely happy. Every morning, when the troops were singing, she would bring a basin of boiled water for the soldiers to drink, and no amount of dissuasion could stop her. During training, due to Wang Keqin's good leadership methods, a new recruit named Xiao Chun even secretly went to the open space at night to practice bayonet drills.

    冀鲁豫前线某部
    普遍开展王克勤运动
    团结互助善带新兵熟练技术军民融洽
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十一日电】冀鲁豫爱国自卫前线某部，已普遍开展王克勤运动，该部文工队并集体创作六场歌剧“王克勤”，不日即赴前线各部队出演。王克勤班的主要特点为：（一）团结互助，善于带领新兵；（二）熟练军事技术；（三）民军关系融洽。王克勤于龙凤战役中升任副排长，将其优良领导作风贯彻到全排。有一次，房东最初不大乐意叫住房子，看到王克勤和战士们万般和气，一天到晚欢欢乐乐的，自动帮助房东作些零活，给房东老大娘拉谈蒋介石的故事，房东老大娘高兴极了，每天大早队伍在唱歌，她老人家就给端盆开水来叫战士喝，劝阻也劝阻不住。练兵中，由于王克勤的领导方法好，有一个新战士叫小春，夜里还偷偷的到空场上去练刺枪。
