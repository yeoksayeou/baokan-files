[Report from this newspaper in Jilu Yu on the 2nd] The Rear Command of the Fourth Military Sub-district of Jilu Yu has issued a circular commending model stretcher bearers and cadres who performed meritorious service in the Junan Campaign. In the Qingfeng stretcher team, thanks to the personal leadership of Director Wu, Political Commissar Wang and other cadres, everyone rushed to carry stretchers. The most frequent carriers carried five times, and the least carried three times. Although they sometimes only had one meal a day and night due to difficult conditions, they still carried the wounded from the front line to the medical clinic in the cold winter night, and then carried them to the surgical department during the day, a journey of about thirty li. Comrade Yuan, an administrator of the county government, and Comrade Shen, a cadre of the Wu Committee of the Third District, personally took the lead and carried stretchers six times back and forth. The Kunwu stretcher team, led by Minister Wen of the work team and Comrade Feng of the county government, carried the wounded. Comrade Xin Shuming personally carried the wounded back and forth; Wang Dian'an's stretcher team transported three wounded, carrying one, supporting one, and carrying one on his back. Stretcher hero Shi Yuanmeng carried the wounded down one by one even when the machine gun fire was the most intense, and took off his coat to cover the wounded. When the wounded could not move, he helped them with their bowel movements. Xia, the minister of Puyang, volunteered to lead the stretcher team and went to the front line every time. He gave his livestock to the patients to ride, which influenced the cadres of the county and district to do it themselves. Section Chief Niu insisted on going to the front despite being ill to take charge of the stretchers. Comrade Wan Shumei of the Fourth District Work Team, who had been suffering from malaria for eight days, insisted on not resting and climbed into the enemy's entrenchments to carry the wounded. Yuan Yuhuai, a cadre family member of Daqing in the Second District, who was nearly fifty years old, rushed into the enemy's wooden stockade and pulled out two wounded soldiers in a row, which everyone admired. The militia carrying stretchers not only took good care of the wounded, but also paid attention to collecting weapons abandoned by the enemy. Some militia squads even replaced their weapons with American-made guns.
    The awards this time are divided into two types: group and individual. The Kunwu Third District stretcher team received a group award of 20,000 yuan in foreign currency. The Nanlou First and Second District stretcher teams received a total of 20,000 yuan. Individual awards were given to Minister Xia of the Puyang Work Team, Yuan Yuhuai of Daqing and other cadre family members, each receiving a bonus. Other awards will be given appropriately by the respective counties.

　　冀鲁豫四分区通令嘉奖鄄南战役模范干部与担架
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】四分区后方指挥部顷通令嘉奖鄄南战役中立功的模范担架与干部。清丰担架队由于吴主任、王政委等干部亲自带头，大家都争先恐后争着抬，最多的抬了五次，最少的也抬了三次。虽然他们有时因条件困难，一天一夜只吃一顿饭，在寒冷的冬夜里，仍从火线上把伤号背下来，抬到医疗所，白天再接着抬到手术科，路程约在三十里左右。县府管理员元同志，三区武委会干部申同志等亲自带头，往返抬了六次。昆吾担架队由工作队温部长与县府冯同志带头抬伤号：辛书明同志自己亲自往返背彩号；王殿安一付担架运了三个伤号；抬着一个，架着一个，背着一个。担架英雄史远梦在机枪打的最紧的时候，仍把伤号一个个的背下来，并将他的大衣脱下来给伤员盖上，伤号不能动，他就扶着伤员大小便。濮阳夏部长自报奋勇带担架，每次都亲上火线，他把自己的牲口让给病号骑，影响到全县县区干部，都亲自下手干。牛股长带病仍坚决赴前方掌握担架。四区工作队的万树美同志，发疟疾八天了，仍坚决不休息，爬到敌人的围砦中背彩号。二区大青的干属袁玉怀将近五十岁了，竟冲到敌人的木寨里边，连着拉了两个彩号下来，大家都很赞服。抬担架的民兵不只很好的照顾伤员，并注意搜集敌人遗弃的武器，有的民兵整班的都换成美造枪。
    这次奖分团体、个人两种。团体奖有昆吾三区担架队，奖洋两万元。南楼一、二区担架队，共奖二万元。个人奖有濮阳工作队夏部长，大青干属袁玉怀等均分别给予奖金。其他由各该县酌量给以适当奖励。
