Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 8th: London dispatch: The British Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, revealed on the 5th of this month that Britain intends to conclude a military treaty with the United States with far-reaching objectives. The chiefs of staff of the British and American armed forces have reached a secret agreement on all the details of the treaty without consulting Parliament. A commentator for Pravda pointed out: "The news in the Daily Worker cannot fail to greatly impress American society, especially at a time when the United Nations General Assembly in New York is discussing the Soviet proposal for disarmament." Both US and British officials have issued statements denying the existence of such a move. According to a United Press reporter, senior US government officials revealed that the US and Britain have agreed on common principles for armies and weapons and have begun to standardize infantry light weapons and equipment. According to an Associated Press reporter, the matter was initiated by the British, who, in view of the reliance of the British army on American aid in the two world wars, felt it necessary to unify the equipment of the two countries and set common standards for their weapons. The matter was discussed as early as Montgomery's visit to the United States, and the British General Staff is now studying and applying some of the American soldiers' training methods. According to the reporter, "However, it is very difficult to get Britain to stockpile a large number of military supplies during peacetime and to get the inherently conservative British to adopt American calculation methods." Although Britain has changed its rifle caliber to fit American bullets, the United States still keeps its Garand rifle secret and does not grant Britain the right to manufacture the weapon. Some observers believe that what the two countries are currently discussing is not a military alliance, but merely a standardization of weapons and equipment. Although the militarists in power in both countries are trying to use this as a stepping stone to further conclude a military alliance, many difficulties arise because the conflict of interests between Britain and the United States is expanding and becoming more obvious. Americans have always opposed military alliances with foreign countries, even in the Second World War, which only appeared in the form of the Lend-Lease Act. On the British side, there are also many people who oppose a military alliance with the United States. Currently, Labor MPs in the House of Commons are questioning the government on this issue.

    英美军国主义分子
    阴谋缔结“军事条约”
    英工人日报揭露
    【新华社延安八日电】伦敦讯：英共机关报、工人日报于本月五日披露，英国打算与美国缔结具有远大目的的军事条约，英美两国参谋总长未与国会商议即已对该条约之一切细则达到秘密协议。真理报评论员指出：“工人日报的消息特别在现时当纽约联合国大会讨论苏联所提裁军建议时，不能不使美国社会人士发生很大的印象。”美英官方均先后发表声明，否认有此举。据合众社记者称：美政府高级官员透露，美英双方已通过军队及武器之共同原则，并已开始就步兵轻武器及配备实行标准化。又据美联社记者报导：此事系由英方发动，因鉴于两次大战中英军都依靠美国援助，故有统一两国装备订出两国武器共同标准的必要。远在蒙哥马利访美时即商谈此事，目下英国参谋部已部分仿照美国兵士训练方法，研究施用。据该记者称：“但欲使英国平时积存大批军用品及使素性保守之英国人采用美国之计算法则困难甚多。”英国虽已改变步枪口径适合于美国枪弹，然美方迄仍保持其加伦汪式枪之秘密，而不予英国制造该武器之权利。若干观察家认为两国目前所商拟者尚非军事同盟，仅为武器装备之划一而已。虽然两国当权之军国主义人物力图以此作为进一步订立军事同盟之阶梯，但因英美两国利害冲突日益扩大与明显，故困难甚多。美国人向来反对与外国订立军事同盟，即在第二次战争中亦仅以租借法案形式出现。而英国方面则反对与美订立军事同盟者亦大有人在。目前下院工党议员抨击政府时即对此提出质问。
