　　Exploiting Loopholes to Conceal Themselves
　　Landlord's Tricks in Xiyaotou Foiled
　　[Special Dispatch] (This Newspaper) In the land reform inspection in Xiyaotou Village, Tangyin, the masses exposed the landlord's conspiracy to buy off cadres to evade the struggle. The masses in Xiyaotou area used to have a saying: "People in Dongyaotou are rich (have big landlords), people in Xiyaotou are poor." Xiyaotou has a total of one hundred and twenty-nine households, and one hundred and twenty households work in coal mines. During the period of mass mobilization, the landlords of the village used the joint struggle and the above saying to incite the masses of the village to struggle against Dongyaotou in order to conceal themselves. They also bought off the village cadres, so that the militia instructor shielded the landlord's guns, and both the chairman of the peasant association and the village chief colluded with the landlord. This land reform inspection was carried out by comparing everyone's past lives to see if they had truly been liberated. It started with the inspection of the poor, and it was discovered that they were originally oppressed by the landlords of the village. The landlords, Li Delu and others, used to organize gangs and collude with the puppet army to oppress the masses. Only because the cadres were deceived by the landlords, no one dared to speak out. Based on this situation, the work was first brewed among the poor masses, and the leadership boldly took the initiative. When the enthusiasm of the masses had been encouraged and they dared to reason with the landlords and local bullies, they seized the opportunity to educate the bought-off cadres and lackeys, asking them to confess and reflect on whether they had shielded materials and grain for the landlords? And they proposed that as long as they confessed their mistakes, the masses would welcome them to participate in the struggle and share the fruits. Under these circumstances, seventeen people quickly confessed, in addition to narrating their own experiences of being bought off, and they also took out more than fifty "shi" of grain that they had concealed. At this point, the cadres and the masses all realized that "taking small advantages leads to being fooled, harming the poor and harming oneself." The landlords were now in complete isolation and were forced to admit their crimes of illegal exploitation. At their own summary meeting, the masses summarized the eight major tricks of the landlords: 1. Buying off cadres. 2. Stubbornly hiding things. 3. Using lackeys to sabotage the peasant association. 4. Giving small favors and pretending to be enlightened. 5. Falsely crying poverty, hiding one's own grain and borrowing other people's grain. 6. Pretending to struggle and dispersing property. 7. Spreading rumors and deceiving. 8. Running away and threatening. The masses completely recognized these points with their own experience and said, "We will never be fooled by the landlords again."

　　钻空子隐蔽自己
    西窑头地主诡计被粉碎
    【本报讯】汤阴西窑头村群众在翻身检查中，揭破地主收买干部逃避斗争阴谋。西窑头一带群众过去有个传说：“东窑头人行（有大地主），西窑头人穷。”西窑头共有一百二十九户，就有一百二十户下煤窑，群运大动阶段，该村地主利用联合斗争和上述传说鼓动本村群众向东窑头斗争，以便隐蔽自己。并将本村干部收买，使民兵指导员为地主包庇枪支，农会主任村长都与地主有勾结。这次翻身检查是用大家比时光，看看究竟翻了身没有的办法开展的。先从穷苦人检查起，发现他们原来受着本村地主的压迫，地主李得禄等四人过去组织局子，与伪军勾结，欺压群众。只因干部为地主蒙蔽，都不敢讲。根据此种情况，先在穷苦群众中进行酝酿，领导上大胆作主，在群众热气已鼓舞起来，并敢于向地主恶霸说理时，便抓紧机会教育被收买干部及狗腿，要他们坦白反省，是否为地主包庇了物资粮食？并提出只要坦白认错，群众还欢迎他们一齐斗争，一齐分果实。在这种情况下，很快就有十七个人坦白，除叙述自己被收买经过外，并拿出自己包藏的粮食五十多石。干部群众至此都认识了“沾小便宜上了当，害穷人也害自己”。地主此时处于完全孤立，被迫承认自己非法剥削的罪行。群众在自己的总结会上总结出地主的八大诡计：一、收买干部。二、藏东西要顽固。三、利用狗腿破坏农会。四、小恩小惠假装开明。五、假哭穷藏自己粮借别人粮。六、假斗争分散财产。七、造谣欺骗。八、逃跑威胁。群众用自己的经验完全认识了这几点，都说：“这可不会再上地主的当了。”
