　　One Thousand Seven Hundred Comfort Bags
　　Ding Man, Zhang Feng
　　On the third day after the victory of the Huaxian Campaign, the frontline troops received 1,700 comfort bags sent from Yuanchao County, three hundred miles away. These comfort bags came from various mass organizations, mostly made by women with various colors and floral fabrics. The bags were filled with various gifts they produced themselves, such as dates, peanuts, melon seeds, pomegranates, persimmons, cigarettes, and banknotes. The girls embroidered flowers of victory on their comfort bags, trimmed them with beautiful lace, and wrote on them, "Respectfully dedicated to the heroic soldiers who are killing the enemy!" The women's association of Dajiang Village packed their comfort bags tightly with peanut kernels, and the mass school filled their comfort bags with dates, writing, "Quickly eliminate the reactionary offensive so that we, the common people, can live a peaceful life." Ye Mei, a member of the women's association of the Fourth District United Association, embroidered several victory flowers on her comfort bag, writing, "Strive for peace, repel Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." Old Li, a veteran of Shuangmiao Village, offered a bag of melon seeds as a gift. Li Rong, a member of the women's association of Zhai Village, embroidered lace on her comfort bag and filled it with four kinds of gifts: pomegranates, dates, peanut kernels, and melon seeds, writing, "If the reactionaries are not eliminated for a single day, we cannot live a peaceful life for a single day." Zhang Xiufeng, a woman, put 25 yuan of consolation money in a bag of peanuts. (Dispatch from the reporter group on the 30th)
