Model Veterinarian
Li Huaijie Cures Over 400 Cattle and Donkeys
Shares Secret Recipes at Heroes Conference

[This News Report] Veterinarian Li Huaijie of Xiling Village, Huguan County, actively serves production, curing 423 cattle and donkeys in ten months. She has been awarded the title of Model Veterinarian, and the county government has issued a commendation. Huaijie spares no effort in imparting her experience, always taking three apprentices with her when she goes to the countryside to treat livestock. At the county's Heroes Conference, she also introduced secret recipes for the most prevalent livestock diseases this year: (1) Bovine Spasmodic Foot Disease – Symptoms: The whole body trembles, the four hooves contract and cannot stand, no nasal mucus, refuses to eat grass. Treatment: Four taels of ginger, four taels of scallions, mash and mix with boiling water, let it cool and then administer orally, and it will heal. (Halve the dose for small calves). Before administering the medicine, it is advisable to prick the front two hooves to draw some blood. (2) Wandering Skin Plague – Symptoms: The skin along the spine bulges, refuses to eat grass. Treatment: First count four ribs on the left side of the cow, then make a cut between every other rib, making a total of three cuts; then make four cuts behind four ribs on the right side. Use the sole of a shoe to vigorously strike the cuts (hit four or five times until yellow fluid comes out, not blood). Then fry one catty of Qu [likely refers to a type of fermented grain used in traditional Chinese medicine or brewing], add four taels of vinegar, mix with boiling water, administer orally, and it will heal. (3) Bone Eye Disease – Symptoms: Lies down and trembles. Treatment: Use a stick to puncture the zygomatic bone and insert it into the nostril (puncture the nostril corresponding to the affected eye), and it will be fine after it bleeds. This is the easiest method. Preventive measures before illness: One tael of fennel, four mace of magnolia bark, three mace of peony root, four mace of Chinese angelica, three mace of alpinia oxyphylla, four taels of tangerine peel, five mace of Sichuan chinaberry, four mace of lotus leaf, five mace of green tangerine peel, five mace of akebia, three scallions (used as a guide), grind and mix with one tael of wine, mix well with boiling water, let it cool and administer orally to prevent this disease. Suitable for spring, autumn, and winter, but avoid using in summer.

    李怀姐医好牛驴四百多头
    群英会上介绍秘方
    【本报讯】壶关西岭村兽医李怀姐积极为生产服务，十个月医好牛驴四百二十三头，荣获模范兽医的称号，该县政府特予通报表扬。怀姐对传授经验，不遗余力，每逢下乡治牲口，都是带三人跟他学徒。在该县群英会上又把今年治牲口最流行的病症的秘方介绍出来：（一）牛窜蹄风症——病状：全身打战，四蹄收缩不立，没鼻珠，不吃草。治法：姜四两，葱四两，捣烂开水冲起，冷后灌上即愈。（小牛减半）在灌药前，把前两蹄扎出些血来为宜。（二）窜皮瘟症——病状：脊梁皮鼓起，不吃草。治法：先在牛的左边挨次数上四根肋肢骨，然后每隔一根割一刀，共割三刀；右边四根肋骨后共割四刀，用鞋底在割口处用力打。割口出来黄水（不是血打四五下即可）后，再用曲一斤，炒后加入四两醋，开水冲之，灌上可愈。（三）骨眼症——病状：卧下打战。治法：用棍子折颧通入鼻孔（那个眼病通那个鼻孔），流血后即好。这是最简易的办法。未病前的预防办法：茴香一两，厚朴四钱，芍药三钱，当归四钱，益知仁三钱，陈皮四两，川练子五钱，荷叶四钱，青皮五钱，木通五钱，葱三根（作引子用），酒一两研末后开水冲好，冷后灌下可防此病。春秋冬均适用，但夏天忌用。
