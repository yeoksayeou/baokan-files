Xinhua News Agency, Lüliang Front, 30th: Military News: While Hu Zongnan's troops attempted to attack Yan'an, Yan Xishan's troops in Lüliang invaded the Jinxi (Western Shanxi) liberated areas from all sides. Our army was forced to counterattack, and after recovering Yonghe and Daning, successively liberated the three cities of Xi County, Pu County, and Shilou. Pu and Xi counties were liberated on the 27th and 28th respectively. In the Xi County campaign, over two thousand people, including Yan’s commander-in-chief in Western Shanxi, Yang Chengyuan, were captured alive. Numerous other items were seized and are being inventoried. These two cities had long suffered under the harsh rule of Yan's army, and the people were extremely miserable. After our army liberated them, the people lined the streets to welcome us, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic and moving. The Yan army in Shilou, intimidated by the prestige of our army, also abandoned the city and fled on the 28th. By this point, the Lüliang liberated area has been connected as a whole, and the three major liberated areas of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin Sui, and Jinji-Lu-Yu can now communicate freely. The threat to the eastern side of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia has also been eliminated.

Guo Weicheng, the battalion commander of the first battalion of the second regiment of the 40th division of the Yan army, who was stationed in × County, was also shot on October 21st for "ineffective defense of the city" and "suspicion of being a disguised element."
