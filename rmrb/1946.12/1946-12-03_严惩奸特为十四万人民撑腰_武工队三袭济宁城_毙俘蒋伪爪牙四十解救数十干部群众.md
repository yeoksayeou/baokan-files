    [This Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 1st Dispatch] The armed work team fighting in the suburbs of Jining City is severely suppressing traitorous elements and attacking Chiang Kai-shek's puppets with warnings, arrests, and executions, providing powerful support to the 140,000 suffering citizens. On the third day after the enemy occupied Jining City, our armed work team advanced to the suburbs. That night, in coordination with a local armed force, it entered Jishi Estuary, Dazha Estuary, Xiaozha Estuary outside the South Gate, and Anxu Street outside the East Gate. A few grenades disarmed the twenty-odd henchmen of the special agent Guo Guangyao at Danao Estuary, and rescued dozens of our Director Chen and village activist cadres. After two bursts of machine-gun fire, dozens of special agents and members of the home-returning corps living in the Lu Lin Egg Factory woke up from their dreams and knelt down to beg the guerrillas for their lives. The enemy on the city wall panicked, constantly firing their guns and shouting, "It's terrible, the Eighth Route Army is here."
    We arrested the Chiang Kai-shek puppet Baozhang Yang Fengli and the Chiang Kai-shek special agent Hu Dianjun, and left warning letters for the bad elements who dared not stay at home. The next day, our propaganda flew in every corner of the city streets, telling the people: "140,000 dear compatriots! We have not left you, we will never forget you, and we will definitely support you at any time...." From then on, the armed work team often haunted places two li outside the city, and the enemy became even more frightened. The heroic guerrillas often attacked the city streets in the dark of night to warn the puppet office workers. One night, the brave men of the armed work team captured Wei Zisheng, a Chiang Kai-shek special agent at No. 58 Fuzi Street, and shot him on the street. The big-character notice of the People's Government was posted on the Big Temple, which read: "Wei Zisheng was born a rogue soldier, a gangster, and an opium addict. Before Jining City was lost, he secretly carried out sabotage activities. After Jining City was occupied by the traitor Wu Huawen, he openly wreaked havoc by arresting people and endangering the families of resistance fighters and activists, and street cadres. After several warnings from us, he refused to change his ways, so he was sentenced to death to serve as a warning." The next day, the matter spread throughout the city, and people cheered and said, "The Eighth Route Army has investigated, and they know who is good and who is bad. Bad guys can't escape sooner or later." The bad guys who used to shout "It's time for the bums to turn over" on the street immediately turned around and warned each other: "Talk less and kowtow more." Jiang Te Li Guangqi from Jiyang Street was killed by us when he went to Jiaxiang to engage in secret society activities. From then on, no more blatant special agents were seen arresting people outside the city gates. At dawn one day, the armed work team defeated an invading home-returning corps, captured the people's traitor Wu Fuying and six members of the home-returning corps alive. On the evening of October 18th, the armed work team, in coordination with the local corps, attacked Nanguan in Jining and divided into several groups to arrest special agents. The troops attacked Xiaonanmen and found no trace of the enemy. They searched along the street and attacked Gu Daifu Hospital, but the home-returning corps stationed there had already run away, and only some foreign noodles were seized. When we attacked the building where a dozen members of the home-returning corps were located in Sishikou, they had not yet noticed. After several grenades exploded, they woke up from their dreams and were taken prisoners. In addition, five special agents and two traitors were captured, and Chiang Kai-shek special agents Yang Yinfu and Li Qingjun from Pacheng were shot on the spot to avenge the families of the resistance fighters and street cadres who had been victimized.

　　严惩奸特为十四万人民撑腰
    武工队三袭济宁城
  　毙俘蒋伪爪牙四十解救数十干部群众
    宣传品满街飞飘警告信写给坏蛋
    大蒋特魏子生伏法
    市民扬眉吐气纷纷叫好坏蛋互诫少说话多磕头
　　　
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】战斗在济宁市郊的武工队，以警告、抓捕、枪杀，严厉镇压奸特分子，打击蒋伪，予苦难中的十四万市民以有力支援。敌人侵占了济宁市的第三天，我武工队就挺进到城郊，当夜配合地方武装一部打进了南门外的吉市口、大闸口、小闸口及东关外的安许街，几个手榴弹将大闹口特务郭广尧的二十米个爪牙缴了枪，并解救了我们的陈主任及村干积极分子几十个人。两梭子机枪响后，住在鲁林蛋厂的几十个特务还乡团员从梦中惊醒，跪下向游击队员们求饶命。城墙上的敌人惊慌了，不住的打枪，并连续喊叫：“了不得，八路上来了。”
    我们把蒋伪保长杨风礼、蒋特胡殿君捉住了，并给不敢在家住的坏分子，留了警告信。第二天，我们的宣传品，飞飘在市街的每个角落里，它向人们说：“十四万亲爱的同胞们！我们没离开你们，我们永远不会忘了你们，不管到任何时候，一定给你们撑腰……。”从此武工队就经常出没于城外二里路的地方，敌人更胆寒了。英勇的游击队员们，常在漆黑的深夜里，攻进市街，向伪办工人员进行警告。一天晚上，武工队的健儿，将阜子街的五十八号，恶贯满盈的蒋特魏子生捉住，拉到大街上枪毙了。人民市政府的大字布告，张贴在大庙上，上写着：“魏子生出身兵痞、流氓、大烟鬼，在济市未失陷前，秘密进行破坏活动，在济市被汉奸吴化文侵占后，即公开肆虐捕人，危害抗属及积极分子、街干，经我数度劝告不改，特将其处以极刑，以警效尤。”第二天，此事传遍了全城，人们都叫好说：“八路军有调查，谁好谁孬都知道，坏蛋早晚跑不了。”以前在大街上高喊“二流子该翻身”的坏蛋，马上回过头来，互诫：“少说话多磕头。”济阳街蒋特李光起到嘉祥去活动会门，也被我们打死了，从此城关外再也看不到明目张胆的特务们抓人了。在一天的拂晓，武工队打垮了一股出犯的还乡团，活捉人民叛徒吴福英及六名还乡团团员。十月十八日晚，武工队配合地方兵团，袭击济宁南关，并划分了几个组去捉特务。部队攻上了小南门，不见敌踪，又顺着大街搜索，打到谷大夫医院时，盘据该处的还乡团早跑了，只缴获了些洋面。四市口的十几个还乡团员，当我们攻上楼去时，还未发觉，几个手榴弹爆炸后，他们从梦中惊醒，都作了俘虏。另外，还捉住五个特务，两个叛徒，并当场将帕城的蒋特杨印福、李庆君枪决，给被害的抗属、街干报了仇。（彭克东）
