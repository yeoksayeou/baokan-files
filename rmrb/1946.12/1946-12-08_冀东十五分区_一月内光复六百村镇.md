Xinhua News Agency, Jidong, 5th -- In the past month, the Jidong Fifteenth Military Sub-district has recovered six hundred villages and towns that had been nibbled away by Chiang's troops, eliminating over eight hundred Chiang's puppet troops. The Eighth Route Army and local armed militia cooperated with each other, forcing the enemy out of their strongholds, and then the armed work teams actively operated in the villages near the strongholds, conducting propaganda, which greatly boosted the morale of the masses. Under the encirclement of the Eighth Route Army guerrillas, the Chiang's puppet troops in Zunhua dared not easily leave the city to grab grain. The city lacked both grain and firewood. The enemy transported military grain from Ji County to provide relief, and they did not dare to move without thousands of people each time, and they were repeatedly severely attacked by the Eighth Route Army on the way.

　　冀东十五分区
  　一月内光复六百村镇
    【新华社冀东五日电】冀东十五分区最近一个月内已恢复被蒋军蚕食去的六百个村镇，歼灭蒋伪军八百余人。八路军及地方武装民兵相互配合，逼走敌据点后，武装工作队即在据点附近村庄，积极活动，进行宣传，群众情绪大为振奋。遵化蒋伪军在八路军游击队的围困下，不敢轻易出城抢粮，城内粮柴均缺，敌人由蓟县运军粮接济，每次非千人不敢行动，在途中亦屡遭八路军痛击。
