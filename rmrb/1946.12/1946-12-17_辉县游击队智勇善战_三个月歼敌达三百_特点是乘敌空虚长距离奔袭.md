　　Huixian Guerrilla Force Fights Courageously and Skillfully
    Annihilates 300 Enemies in Three Months
    Characterized by Long-Distance Raids Taking Advantage of Enemy Weakness
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Huixian guerrilla forces are courageous and skillful in battle, with brilliant achievements. From September to November, they engaged in 15 battles, capturing 87 enemies, killing 80 enemy soldiers including company commanders and squad leaders, and wounding 128 enemies. They seized 3 machine guns, 76 rifles and pistols, over 7,000 rounds of ammunition, 200 hand grenades, 12 artillery shells, and a portion of other military supplies; recovered 16 cattle and donkeys looted from the masses by the enemy, and rescued 5 captured activists. The county's core regiment, district detachments, militia, and work teams cooperated closely, often penetrating deep behind enemy lines taking advantage of enemy weakness, achieving surprise victories, and proactively attacking the enemy. In mid-November, they raided Zhao Tun and ambushed Liuhe, completely annihilating the "Returning Home Corps" in both instances. They also launched a surprise attack on Lu Wang's Tomb. On November 6, the 5th and 6th District detachments jointly raided the Hetun Railway Station, capturing all four ticket clerks and seizing a significant amount of military supplies. They are adept at long-distance raids; when attacking Zhao Tun, they went straight to the village from 75 miles away, setting up machine guns on the rooftops. The enemy only discovered them when they were already completely surrounded and had nowhere to escape. The battle ended in less than 15 minutes. The next day, the Returning Home Corps, in coordination with enemy troops from two directions, attacked Da Ma Village. After the enemy stepped into the ambush circle, a shout was given, and the ambush troops came out from all sides, throwing the enemy into chaos. In this battle, 25 enemies were killed or captured, and many supplies were seized. In September, the puppet security team established a stronghold in Gongshan. The guerrillas took advantage of the enemy's unstable foothold and the unfinished fortifications and bunkers to approach the blockhouse and concentrate firepower, throwing 130 hand grenades in eight seconds, killing the puppet company commander Yan Shan and others. When the enemy retreated from Nancun, the guerrillas seized the opportunity to pursue them vigorously. The enemy, with no intention of resisting, abandoned their bodies and weapons and fled. On October 28, a regiment of Chiang's troops invaded ×× Village. The defending guerrillas, only one company and one platoon in strength, had the militia fire potshots to lure the enemy deep. The guerrillas then launched a surprise attack, killing the enemy platoon leader and eight others. On October 14, the puppet bandit Li Ying, with over 2,000 men, invaded Gaozhuang. The main force of the guerrillas occupied the advantageous terrain of Xiaozhuang to block them. The 4th District detachment took advantage of the enemy's rear being empty and attacked Baiquan, burning down the enemy blockhouse, causing the enemy to flee back in panic.
