　　Tangyin's Experience in Resettling Refugees
    Strengthening Confidence in Victory and Organizing Production for Self-Salvation
    [Report from This Newspaper] The Tangyin Democratic Government has recently gained some preliminary experience in resettling refugees fleeing from the Chiang-occupied areas: 1. Firmly establish confidence in victory. When the Chiang army's barbaric hooves began to step into Tangyin County, the masses fled to the mountains because of the narrow experience that the Chiang army had retreated after only five days of occupying Hebi last year, thinking they could return in a few days. Later, the enemy continued to suppress them in the mountainous areas, which caused ideological confusion. The leadership immediately explained that there would be no peace without defeating the warlord Chiang Kai-shek, publicized the news of our army's victory, explained Chairman Mao's operational principles, pointed out that our army would surely win, and that only resolute struggle was the way out, turning the refugees' pain into strength and laying the foundation for the struggle against the enemy. 2. Establish the idea of self-salvation through production. After their emotions stabilized, the refugees still had negative and dependent thoughts such as "live one day at a time" and "the Eighth Route Army won't let anyone starve to death." At this time, the slogan "Self-salvation through production is the only way to return home early" was put forward, explaining that refugees eating public grain would prevent raising soldiers, and that without an army, the enemy could not be driven away, and they were organized to carry out production. 3. Guidelines and specific practices: The guidelines are: government assistance, economize on production, and establish households. Specific practices: First, organize refugees to settle down and mobilize the masses to support them. Initially, provide each person with 1.25 jin of millet per day for one month. The method of distributing grain is to give more to those from Chiang-occupied areas, less to those from guerrilla areas, and none to those from base areas. Give less to those with labor power, and more to those without, and give special consideration to family members of martyrs and militiamen without labor power. Before the distribution, it is discussed by the masses and approved by county and district cadres. Loans of money, grain, and cotton are also provided to organize textile and transportation production. Encourage people to do what they are capable of, so that everyone is mobilized. Children graze cattle and chop firewood, women spin cotton and grind flour, and men transport and carry loads. Exchange experiences and commend typical examples in production at any time. Secondly, in terms of economy, it is necessary to break the method of cooking in large pots to reduce waste. Establish households according to families, and those who do not have enough households voluntarily combine households, implementing the principle of mutual assistance in production and decentralized living. The slogan "Look ahead and behind, steady flow of water" was put forward, such as the refugees in Siwan said, "Better to eat half a meal than to have no meal," encouraging everyone to learn to plan and eat some bran and vegetables appropriately to ensure a regular life.

　　汤阴安置难民经验
    坚定胜利信心组织生产自救
    【本报讯】汤阴民主政府最近在安置蒋占区逃来的难民工作中初步获得几点经验：一、坚定必胜信心。蒋军兽蹄开始踏进汤阴县境时，群众因有去年蒋军进占鹤壁五天即行退走的狭隘经验，遂逃往山上，以为几天就可以回去；以后敌人继续回山地压制，因此思想混乱起来。领导上当即说明不打垮恶霸蒋介石不能太平，宣传我军胜利消息，讲解毛主席作战原则，指出我军必胜，及只有坚决斗争才是出路，将难民的痛苦变成力量，打下对敌斗争基础。二、树立生产自救思想。情绪安定后，难民中仍存有“过了一日算一日”“八路军不叫饿死人”等消极依赖思想，此时即提出“生产自救才能早回家”口号，说明难民吃公粮就不能养兵，没有军队就打不走敌人的道理，组织其进行生产。三、方针和具体作法：方针是：政府帮助，节约生产，建立家务。具体作法：首先是组织难民安家，发动群众支援。先按每人每日斤四两小米发给一月粮食，发粮的办法是蒋占区的多发，游击区的少发，根据地的不发。有劳力者少发，无劳力者多发，特别照顾无劳力之抗属与民兵家属。分发前经过群众讨论，县区干部批准。并贷款、贷粮、贷花，以组织纺织及运输等生产。提倡能干啥的干啥，使大家都动起来。儿童放牛砍柴，妇女纺花推磨，男人运输担挑。在生产中随时交换经验，表扬典型。其次在节约方面，要打破大锅作饭办法，以减少浪费。按户立家，不够户的自愿碰家，实行在生产上互助，在生活上分散的原则。提出：“瞻前顾后，细水长流”口号，如寺湾难民说：“能吃半顿，不叫断顿”，鼓励大家学会计划，并适当吃些糠菜，以保证生活经常。
