　　Kunming Massacre Anniversary
    Liberation Daily Editorial
    On this day last year, the Jiang government committed a great massacre of patriotic students in Kunming. Although this tragedy occurred a year ago, the scene of flying flesh and blood is still deeply imprinted in the memory of the Chinese people.
    After the Kunming Massacre, Chiang Kai-shek continued to manufacture appalling incidents. The four oaths were still ringing in our ears, and the ink on the Political Consultative Conference resolutions was not yet dry when the Jiaochangkou Massacre occurred. After that, Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo were assassinated, Mr. Sun Pingtian, a reporter from Nantong, was tortured to death, and people making peaceful petitions in Xiaguan were severely beaten. One fascist atrocity after another is too numerous to mention, until recently, when Mr. Zhu Xuefan was attacked by Chiang's secret agents in Hong Kong. The record of the past year proves that Chiang Kai-shek has been single-mindedly trying to suppress the great movement of the Chinese people demanding independence, peace, democracy, and opposition to selling out the country, civil war, and dictatorship by bloody means.
    However, the events of the past year have also proved that Chiang Kai-shek's delusion of attempting to eliminate the people's movement has suffered a head-on blow. From a series of tragedies, people from all walks of life across the country have increasingly realized that asking Chiang Kai-shek to "return power to the people" is actually "seeking skin from a tiger" (as Mr. Chen Jiageng said). Chiang Kai-shek quickly lost popular support through the crimes he himself committed. The American imperialist elements supporting him also quickly exposed their hideous faces in front of the Chinese people. The level of awareness of the vast people in the KMT-controlled areas has rapidly increased. They have not been intimidated by Chiang Kai-shek's terrorist methods, and their mass movement is developing extensively and deeply. In particular, the strong self-defense war of the military and civilians in the liberated areas has continuously achieved victories, which has further increased the belief of the compatriots in the KMT-controlled areas in a bright future.
    The ideas of dictators and the consequences they obtain always run counter to each other. He wants to use bloody means to deal with the people's movement in order to maintain his traitorous, dictatorial rule, but the result is that this rule becomes more precarious. He wants to use the illegal "National Assembly" and intensify the attack on the liberated areas to save his ruling crisis, but the result is that this "National Assembly" will be the beginning of the failure of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule, and the people's war will achieve the final victory. Chiang Kai-shek has tried everything possible to destroy the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and the January 10th ceasefire agreement, but the result is that the people of the whole country will make persistent efforts to fight for the adherence to these agreements.
    On the first anniversary of the Kunming Massacre, we can comfort the martyrs who died: the strength of the Chinese people has become stronger in the past year, just as the War of Resistance against Japan, signaled by "December 9th," achieved the final victory. The great movement of the Chinese people against Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, dictatorship, civil war, and demanding independence, democracy, and freedom, signaled by "December 1st," will also achieve the final victory.

　　昆明惨案一周年
    解放日报社论
    去年今日，昆明发生蒋政府屠杀爱国学生的大惨案。这个惨案虽然过去了一年，然而当时血肉横飞的情景仍然深深地印在中国人民的记忆里。
    昆明惨案以后，蒋介石不断地制造令人发齿的事件，四项誓言言犹在耳，政协决议墨汁未干，就发生了较场口的惨案。此后，李公朴、闻一多两先生被暗杀，南通新闻记者孙平天先生的被虐杀，下关和平请愿的人民被痛殴，一幕一幕的法西斯暴行书不胜书，一直到最近朱学范先生在香港遭受蒋记特务暗害。一年来的记录，证明蒋介石一心一意想以血腥手段镇压中国人民要求独立和平民主反对卖国内战独裁的伟大运动。
    然而一年的事变，又证明蒋介石企图消灭人民运动的妄想已经遭遇了当头的打击。从一连串的惨案中，全国各阶层人民，日益认识要蒋介石“还政于民”实等于“与虎谋皮”（陈嘉庚先生语）。蒋介石经过他自己制造的罪案，很快的丧失人心。支持他的美帝国主义分子，在中国人民的面前亦很快的暴露了狰狞面目。蒋管区广大人民的觉悟程度很快的提高，他们并没有被蒋介石的恐怖手段所吓退，他们的群众运动正在广泛和深入地开展。尤其解放区军民坚强的自卫战争不断获得胜利，更加增加蒋管区同胞对于光明前途的信念。
    独裁者的想法及其所得到的后果总是背道而驰，他想用血腥手段对付人民运动，以维持其卖国独裁的统治，但是结果却是这个统治的更趋危殆。他想拿非法“国大”和加紧对解放区进攻来挽救其统治危机，但其结果正是这个“国大”将会成为蒋介石独裁统治失败之开始，而人民战争就会获得最后的胜利。蒋介石想尽一切办法来摧毁政协决议和一月十日停战协定，然而结果却是全国人民再接再厉为坚持这些协定而奋斗。
    在昆明惨案一周年的今天，我们可以告慰于死难的诸烈士：一年来中国人民的力量更强大了，正如以“一二九”为信号的对日抗战得到最后胜利。以“一二一”为信号的中国人民反对蒋介石卖国独裁内战要求独立民主自由的伟大运动，也一定会得到最后胜利。
