　　Chiang and Yan Enforce Conscription
    Even Landlords and Puppet Officials Can't Stand It
    Landlords in Quwo Generally Return Undone Account Materials
    [Reported by our Taiyue correspondent on the 13th] Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's vicious conscription plot has aroused widespread resistance from peasants, merchants, landlords, and village organization personnel. Chiang and Yan are constantly dispatching large numbers of "Love the Village Corps" special agents in occupied areas such as Xia County, Xiangling, Quwo, and Linfen to conscript men. Every time they arrive at a village, they guard the four gates and arrest all men between the ages of eighteen and forty. On the 16th, the "Love the Village Corps" of Xia County surrounded Dayang Town late at night, blocked the four gates, scaled the walls and entered the village to search house by house, arresting more than forty people. It is even more noteworthy that the Chiang army has established a so-called "March 8th" headquarters conscription bureau in Houma, deceptively promoting that "young people who come here will not be conscripted." Under this conspiracy, many young people were deceived and fell into this trap. Initially, the young people were asked to repair bunkers, dig trenches, and other fortifications. Soon after, they were organized into teams and sent to Yuncheng to be incorporated into the "Central Army." The first batch consisted of more than two thousand people. This kind of insidious scheme has aroused hatred and resistance from peasants, merchants, landlords, and even village organization personnel in the occupied areas. Li Guangyuan and Li Xiaoyuan, who escaped from Weixiang Town, tearfully told others: "If you are caught by those sons of bitches, they will starve you for a month before killing you. When you can't run anymore, they will add you to the army." People who escaped from Linfen said: "The shops in Linfen City cannot escape this trap either. If the shops do not send people, they have to pay one million 法幣 (legal tender). In addition to paying more than two million 法幣 every month, they also have the burden of providing conscripts. Even with the capital, it is not enough. The chairman of the chamber of commerce is discussing a strike with the shops and petitioning, but he was immediately labeled as a Communist suspect by the Chiang army and detained." Even the village organization personnel of Chen Village under the control of the puppet fifth district of Quwo, dissatisfied with the conscription, fled to the Yicheng liberated area. The landlords of various villages, unable to withstand the oppression of the Chiang army's conscription and requisition of funds, have begun to change. They have returned the livestock and grain previously taken from the peasants and militiamen in undone accounts, and apologized to them. They also realize that the Chiang army will not occupy for long, so they should leave a way out for themselves!

　　蒋阎抓丁
    地主伪员也受不了
    曲沃地主普遍退回倒算物资
    【本报太岳十三日电】蒋、阎恶毒的编组抓丁阴谋已激起农民、商人地主、编村人员的普遍反抗。蒋阎近在夏县、襄陵、曲沃、临汾等占领区内日必出动大批“爱乡团”特务等到处抓丁，每到一村即把守四门，对十八至四十岁的男人，一律逮捕。十六日夏县爱乡团，深夜将大洋镇包围，四门堵住，越墙进村，挨家搜查，共抓走四十余人。更值得注意的，是蒋军在侯马成立了一个所谓“三八”总部的拐兵局，欺骗宣传说：“青年人来我们这里不编组。”在这种阴谋下，不少青年被骗，落入此圈套，开始时叫青年修碉堡、挖战壕等工事，不久便编队送往运城编入“中央军”，第一批有两千余人，此种阴谋鬼计已激起被占区农民、商人、地主甚至编村人员的憎恨与反抗。从尉乡镇逃来的李广元、李小元两泪汪汪告他人说：“被狗日的抓走，不杀先饿你一个月，等你跑不动了，再把你补充队伍。”由临汾逃出来的人说：“临汾城各商号也逃不出这圈套，商号无人出，只得出一百万元法币，各商号除每月负担二百多万元外，又有壮丁负担，连本算上也不够，商号理事长正和各商号商议罢市请愿，立刻被蒋军指为八路嫌疑，扣押起来。”连其曲沃伪第五区统治下之陈村编村人员，亦因不满编组向翼城解放区潜逃，各村地主受不住蒋军编组抓丁征款的压榨，已开始转变，将以前倒算农民与民兵之牲口、粮食纷纷送回，还给他们道歉，他们也认识了蒋军占不久，给自己留条后路吧！
