Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 7th: New York dispatch: Murray, Chairman of the U.S. Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), called for a national workers' conference on the 6th to formulate a joint economic and legislative struggle program among major labor unions. Murray's call came after the U.S. Federal Court fined Lewis $10,000. He appealed to leaders of the other two major labor unions outside the CIO—the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Railway Labor Unions—saying: "The time has come for American labor leaders to abandon prejudices and personal interests and successfully formulate a joint program to fight for the interests of the nation and the democratic system." He emphasized the necessity of united action by all American workers and unions to protect the American working class, as the American working class is now facing the danger of "being paralyzed." He said: "All the social progress that workers have won in the past few years is being threatened by congressional leaders who are systematically engaging in incitement." After Murray's call, Martin Miller, a prominent leader of the Railway Labor Unions, declared that holding such a conference at this time is opportune, and he believes that the Railway Labor Unions will accept Murray's proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 7th: Washington dispatch: The U.S. Federal Court sentenced coal miners' leader Lewis and his union on the 4th for contempt of court, on the pretext that Lewis and the union failed to comply with the court's order requiring coal miners to continue working. Lewis was fined $10,000, and the union $3.5 million. Lewis and the union expressed their disapproval and have filed an appeal. This judgment was entirely in accordance with the wishes of the Truman government. Coal miners have protested against this judgment. On the morning of the 5th, Pittsburgh miners rode 20 motorcycles to the vicinity of the mine to set up picket lines and overturned coal trucks. The large-scale strike of 400,000 miners, which the U.S. government adopted such high-handed measures to suppress, has been ongoing since the 20th of last month, with no signs of ending. The entire United States is rapidly heading towards an industrial crisis. Dozens of factories have only a few days' worth of coal reserves. Ford Motor Company announced that its Detroit factory has been shut down. The Ohio power supply was cut off the day before yesterday at midnight. The last batch of coal reserves was used up last Saturday, and cities unable to heat are threatened by influenza.

    【新华社延安七日电】纽约讯：美产业工会联合会主席莫莱，于六日号召召开全美工人会议，以制订各大工会间的联合的经济与立法的斗争纲领。莫莱的号召适在美国联邦法庭判处路易斯以万元罚金之后，他向产联以外其他两大工会——美国劳工联合会及铁路工会领袖呼吁称：“美国各工会领袖捐弃成见与个人利益，胜利的制定联合纲领，以争取国家及民主制度之利益的时机已经到来了。”他强调全美工人及联合会有团结行动以保护美国工人阶级的必要，因美工人阶级现正面临“被麻痹”的危险。他说：“过去若干年来，工人所争得的一切社会进步，已受到有系统的从事煽动的国会领袖们的威胁。”莫莱号召发出后，铁路工会的杰出领袖之一马丁密勒宣称：目前召开这种会议正得其时，他认为铁路工会将接受莫莱的倡议。
    【新华社延安七日电】华盛顿讯：美国联邦法庭已于四日宣判煤矿工人领袖路易斯及其工会以蔑视法庭罪，借口为路氏及工会未遵从法庭所颁布要煤矿工人继续工作之命令。路氏罚金一万元，工会三百五十万元。路氏及工会表示不服，已提出上诉。此一判决全系按杜鲁门政府之意旨而行，煤矿工人已纷纷抗议此判决。匹兹堡矿工于五日晨乘二十辆摩托车至矿井周围布置罢工纠察线，并将煤车倾复，由美政府采取此种高压手段自上月二十日开始的四十万矿工大罢工，迄无结束，征象全美正迅速走向工业危机。几十家工厂仅有数日存煤。福特汽车公司宣布其底得律工厂已停工，俄亥俄州电灯已于前日夜半中断，最后一批存煤已于上星期六用光，无法取暖之城市已受流行性感冒之威胁。
