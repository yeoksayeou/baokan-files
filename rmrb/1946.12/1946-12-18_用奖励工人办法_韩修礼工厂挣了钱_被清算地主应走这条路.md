　　Using Worker Incentives
    Han Xiuli's Factory Made Money
    Landlords Being Liquidated Should Take This Path
    [This newspaper's Wu'an dispatch] The Han Xiuli Textile Factory has four groups: weaving cloth, knitting socks, spinning yarn, and fluffing cotton. Because the management implemented a system of more praise and more rewards, increasing workers' wages based on skill level and output, the workers spontaneously launched a production increase competition, and output doubled. For example, with iron loom weaving of colored cloth, the output was previously 15 zhang per worker, now it has increased to 30 zhang, a doubling of the previous output. Sock knitting was previously 3 dozen per worker, now it has increased to 5 dozen, an increase of two-thirds compared to the past. As output increased, wages also increased. For example, with iron loom weaving of colored cloth, the previous wage was 200 yuan per 15 zhang, now with 30 zhang per worker, the wage is increased accordingly. The same applies to sock knitting and yarn spinning, and the factory also profits. For example, weaving 15 zhang of colored cloth cost 3,000 yuan, now the market price is 5,000 yuan, so a profit of 2,000 yuan can be made. Mr. Han Xiuli said: "When I first opened this factory, many people said that opening a factory could not make money. Now the facts have broken this argument. The question is not whether you can make money, but whether you can increase workers' wages, implement reasonable management methods, and increase workers' production enthusiasm. Opening a factory can then make a profit." (Fu Cang)

　　用奖励工人办法
    韩修礼工厂挣了钱
    被清算地主应走这条路
    【本报武安讯】韩修礼纺织工厂，全厂分织布、织袜、纺线、弹花四个组，由于管理上实行了多表扬多奖励的办法，按技术高低，产量多寡奖励工人提高工资，工人们自动开展增产竞赛，产量提高一倍。如铁机织色布，过去每工织十五丈，现增至三十丈，较前提高一倍；织袜过去每工三打，现增至五打，比过去增高三分之二。产量增高工资也增高，如铁机织色布，过去织十五丈一工洋二百元，现一工织三十丈，就按三十丈增加工资，其他织袜纺线也是如此，而厂方也有利可图。如织色布一工织十五丈，成本洋三千元，现市价洋五千元，即可赚洋二千元。韩修礼先生说：“我初开这个工厂时，许多人说开工厂赚不了钱，现在事实已经把这种说法打破了。问题不在于能不能赚钱，而在于要能提高工人工资，实行合理的管理方法，提高工人生产情绪，开工厂就能赚利。”（复仓）
