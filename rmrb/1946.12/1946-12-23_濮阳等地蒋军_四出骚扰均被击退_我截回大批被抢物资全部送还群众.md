　　Puyang and Other Areas Chiang Kai-shek Troops
    Harass in All Directions but Are Repelled
    We Intercept a Large Batch of Looted Goods and Return Them All to the Masses
    [This newspaper, Frontline of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, 21st dispatch] Correspondent Yong Jin reports: Since Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied Puyang, Qingfeng, and Neihuang, they have been harassing in all directions, but all have been repelled by our army. On the 12th, the 75th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops stationed in Liuxiatun, Puyang, attacked Changhezhai with more than a thousand soldiers. Our defending troops calmly responded. Comrade Ma Yunsheng's neck was shot through, but he continued to fire at the enemy with his machine gun. After two hours of fierce fighting, more than 30 enemies were killed. On the 14th, a part of the 6th Brigade of the 75th Division, about 500 strong, set out from Liuxiatun again, attempting to loot the areas of Xiaolou and Tonghezhai. They were crushed by our troops, with more than 60 enemies killed and eight captured. Our army pursued them directly to the vicinity of Liuxiatun.
    [This newspaper, Frontline of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, 20th dispatch] Correspondent Yong Jin reports: During the battle of Changhezhai on the 14th, our army intercepted a cart of materials looted by Chiang Kai-shek's troops from the masses, including three pigs, six chickens, more than 20 catties of cotton, four kitchen knives, a few feet of cloth, a bag of salt, and oil bottles, etc., looted from Xiaolou. The next day, Comrade Li, the civil affairs officer of a certain unit of our army, returned all the intercepted items to the masses in villages such as Xiaolou. As soon as the people saw Comrade Li and others, they surrounded them, showing great affection. An old woman took back the cloth she had woven, and another old woman's white hen was also returned. The old woman wanted to kowtow to Comrade Li, but Comrade Li said, "We are a team under the leadership of Chairman Mao, dedicated to eliminating harm for the people, so don't do that." The old woman then said, "When I see Chairman Mao in the future, I will have to invite him to a meat meal even if I haven't eaten for three days!" When leaving, the people rushed to see them off, asking the Eighth Route Army to drive away the Chiang Kai-shek troops as soon as possible.

    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十一日电】通讯员勇进报导称：蒋军自进占我濮阳、清丰、内黄后，四出骚扰，均遭我军击退。十二日占驻濮阳柳下屯之蒋军七十五师，以千余人之兵力东犯我长河寨，我守军某部沉着应战，马云生同志的脖子被打穿了，他还端着机枪射击敌人。激战二小时，毙敌三十余人。十四日，七十五师六旅一部约五百余，又自柳下屯出发，企图至萧楼、通河寨一带抢掠，为我某部击溃，毙敌六十余，俘敌八名。我军直追至柳下屯附近。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十日电】通讯员勇进报导称：十四日长河寨战斗中，我军截回蒋军抢夺群众之物资一车，内有萧楼被抢之猪三口、鸡六只、棉花二十余斤、菜刀四把，布匹余尺、食盐一袋及油瓶等物，我某部民运股李干事等，次日将全部截获的东西送还萧楼等村群众，老百姓一见李干事等，就把他们团团包围起来，亲热异常。一个老太太拿回了他织的布，另一个老大娘的一只白母鸡也给送来了，老大娘要给李干事叩头，李干事说：“我们是毛主席领导下的队伍，是给老百姓除害的，可别这样？”这个老大娘又说：“将来见了毛主席，三天不吃饭也得请他吃顿肉！”走时，老百姓争着送出来，要求八路军赶快把蒋军赶跑。
