　　Border Region Government Education Department
    Calls on Primary School Teachers Throughout the Region to Write One Million Letters of慰劳 (consolation/support)
    [Our Dispatch] The Education Department of the Border Region Government recently issued an instruction to primary school teachers throughout the region, calling for a campaign to write one million letters of慰劳 (consolation/support) on behalf of the military families throughout the region. The statement said: In the past six months, our Border Region has been conducting a patriotic war of self-defense, winning successive battles with high morale, and the movement to support the front from the rear has also achieved remarkable results. According to feedback from the front, soldiers need to understand their family situations. Since the mass emancipation movement, they often worry about whether their families have received land and whether the village has taken care of their families since they went on expeditions. It is very effective for district and village cadres to write them a letter of慰劳 (consolation/support), reporting on their family situation. We call on primary school teachers in each village to take on this task, writing letters on behalf of the village cadres to the military families, and for all teachers in the region to work hard to write one million letters of慰劳 (consolation/support)!

    号召全区小学教员代写百万封慰劳信
    【本报讯】边区政府教育厅，日前向全区小学教员发出指示，号召为全区军属代写一百万封慰劳信运动。该表示称：半年来我边区进行爱国自卫战争，连战皆捷士气昂扬，后方支援前线运动亦成绩昭著。兹据前方反映，战士需要了解他们家庭情况，群众翻身运动以来，他们常常惦念自己家庭是否得到土地，出征以后村里是否照顾了他的家庭。区村干部给他们写一封慰劳信，报告一下他家庭的情况效力颇大。我们号召各村小学教师担任这个工作，代替村干部给军属写信，全区教员为写百万封慰劳信而努力！
