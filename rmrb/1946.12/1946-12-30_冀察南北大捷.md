　　Great Victories in Northern and Southern Hebei-Chahar

　　Just as Li Zongren, the Director of Chiang Kai-shek's Beiping Executive Headquarters, was publicly lying on the 21st of this month, saying: "I instructed my commanders to strictly abide by the ceasefire order and not to fight unless attacked," and shamelessly claiming that the "government" army would resume its offensive (see Associated Press report), our Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei People's Liberation Army, on the same day, with the victory of the Mancheng self-defense annihilation battle, exposed his lies and responded to his offensive. It turned out that Chiang Kai-shek's 53rd Army, 130th Division's 388th Regiment, 389th Regiment, 116th Division's 346th and 348th Regiments, and Liu Huarong's Provisional First Route Army, First Column's Second Regiment, Second Column's Third Regiment, totaling six regiments, began their offensive from Caohe, Baoding towards the eastern liberated areas of Mancheng two days before Li Zongren made the above statement (December 19th). As a result, they encountered the self-defensive counterattack of the local People's Liberation Army, and after a fierce battle for a day and two nights, the three American-equipped regiments of the 388th Regiment, the Provisional First Route Army's First Column Second Regiment, and the Second Column Third Regiment were completely annihilated. More than 2,600 officers and soldiers, including the three regimental commanders, were captured alive, more than 1,500 officers and soldiers were killed, and more than 50 artillery pieces, more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 1,500 rifles were captured, forcing Li Zongren to admit: "My troops are at a great disadvantage." (See Associated Press report of December 21st)

　　Echoing the victory of Mancheng in the north and south, the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei People's Liberation Army heroically counterattacked Fu Zuoyi's troops in northern Hebei on the 9th of this month. They once recovered Chongli City and annihilated more than 1,200 cavalrymen of Fu's Suiyuan Security Forces. Adding the Zhao Chuanbao battle and the Dushikou battle last month, a total of more than 2,200 of Fu's troops were annihilated. This made Fu Zuoyi's control of Zhangjiakou and the Ping-Sui Railway feel greatly threatened. No wonder that after the fall of Chongli, he expressed "extreme grief" and "repeatedly beat his chest." (See Central News Agency report of December 18th)

　　However, this is only the beginning of the "great disadvantage" and "painful chest-beating" for the warmongers. When our army took the initiative to withdraw from Zhangjiakou, weren't Fu Zuoyi and others overjoyed and mistook vulgarity for fun? At that time, we affirmed that the temporary abandonment of Zhangjiakou would only increase the burden on the Chiang-Fu troops, while enabling the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Eighth Route Army to obtain greater maneuverability and increase the opportunity to annihilate the enemy's living forces. Now, the basic weaknesses of the Chiang-Fu troops' insufficient strength and dispersion of forces are becoming increasingly serious, and the People's Liberation Army has more and more opportunities to maneuver and annihilate the enemy; the battles of Mancheng and Chongli are just a good start.

　　In Chiang Kai-shek's entire civil war deployment, the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei area occupies a very important position. Chiang Kai-shek relied on American planes and ships to transport his troops, and relied on the US military stationed in China to guard the railways and warehouses, attempting to consolidate the occupation of the section from Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding to Zhangjiakou, and further divide our North China Liberated Area, cutting off the connection between our North China and Northeast. Recently, he further divided Hebei Province into "pacification zones," and specially dispatched anti-communist "big shots" to command the areas and attack our Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Liberated Area. However, the heroic people and soldiers of Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei, who have excellent and glorious fighting traditions in the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, have continuously dealt blows to the invaders in the self-defense war for the past six months. According to incomplete statistics, the Chiang army has been annihilated more than 22,000 people in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei area after occupying Zhangjiakou. Especially since the 9th of this month, our army has successively won victories in four different regions after Gu'an in central Hebei (14th), Baodi in eastern Hebei (15th), and Mancheng and Chongli, annihilating more than 7,000 enemies in twelve days. It is particularly worth pointing out that the People's Liberation Army has begun local counter-offensives in some areas, and the recovery of Baodi in eastern Hebei and the intrusion into Chongli in northern Hebei are obvious examples. These victories have given great encouragement to the military and civilians in the liberated areas and the people of the whole country. We believe that the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei military and civilians will certainly be able to make persistent efforts, not be satisfied with the victories they have achieved, and use all their strength to strive for new and greater victories, and completely smash Chiang Kai-shek's civil war system.

### 冀察南北大捷

　　冀察南北大捷
    正当蒋介石的北平行辕主任李宗仁于本月二十一日当众说谎：“我指示我之指挥官恪遵停战令，除非受攻击不作战”，并大言不惭地说什么“政府”军将恢复攻势（见美联社电）的时候，我晋察冀人民解放军就在同一天以满城自卫歼灭战的胜利，揭穿了他的谎言，回答了他的进攻。原来蒋介石的五十三军一三○师的三八八团、三八九团，一一六师的三四六、三四八团，及暂编第一路军刘化南部，第一纵队二团第二纵队三团，共六个团兵力，在李宗仁发表上述谈话的前两天（十二月十九日）就开始了由保定漕河向满城以东解放区的进攻。结果遭遇了当地人民解放军的自卫反击，激战一昼两夜，即将其美械三八八团和暂一路军一纵队二团、二纵队三团共三个团全部歼灭。生俘其三个团长以下官兵二千六百余人，击毙官兵一千五百余，缴获各种炮五十余门，轻重机枪一百余挺，步枪一千五百余支，迫得李宗仁不能不承认：“我的部队大为不利”。（见美联社二十一日电）
    与满城之捷南北相映辉，晋察冀人民解放军于本月九日在塞北向傅军英勇反击。一度收复崇礼城，歼灭傅部绥东保安骑兵一千二百余人。加上上月的赵川堡战斗和独石口战斗，共歼灭傅军二千二百余人。使得傅作义对张垣与平绥线的控制感受重大的威胁。无怪他在崇礼失守之后，要表示“不胜痛心”，并“频频以手捶胸”了。（见中央社十二月十八日电）
    但是，这才仅仅是好战分子们“大为不利”和“痛心捶胸”的开头。当我军主动撤出张垣的时候，傅作义等岂不是得意忘形，将肉麻当有趣？就在那时，我们曾肯定地指出，张垣的暂时弃守，将只会增加蒋傅军的负担，而使晋察冀八路军取得更大的机动，增加歼灭敌人有生力量的机会。现在，蒋傅军的兵力不足与兵力分散的基本弱点日益严重，人民解放军机动歼敌的机会愈来愈多；满城、崇礼两役，还只是一个良好的开端。
    在蒋介石的全部内战部署中，晋察冀地区所占的位置是十分重要的。蒋介石靠了美机美舰替他运兵，靠了驻华美军替他把守铁路与仓库，企图借此巩固平、津、保到张家口一段的占领，并进一步分割我华北解放区，遮断我华北与东北的联系。最近更在河北全省划分“绥靖区”，专派反共“大员”分区指挥，进攻我晋察冀解放区。但是，在八年抗战中有着优秀和光荣斗争传统的英勇晋察冀军民，在半年来的自卫战争中已不断地予进犯者以打击。据不完全的统计，蒋军在侵占张垣以后，在晋察冀地区被歼灭的已在二万二千人以上，尤其从本月九日以来，我军在冀中固安（十四日）冀东宝坻（十五日）和满城、崇礼之后，在四个不同地区接连获得胜利，十二天内歼敌七千余人。特别值得指出的，人民解放军已在若干地区开始了局部的反攻，冀东的收复宝坻和察北的突入崇礼即是显例。这些胜利，都给解放区军民和全国人民以很大的鼓舞。我们相信，晋察冀军民一定能够再接再厉，不满足已得的胜利，用全力来争取新的更大的胜利，来彻底粉碎蒋介石的内战体系。（十二月二十七日）
