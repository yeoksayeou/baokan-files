Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 4th. The Jinji Luyu Border Assembly and the Border Region Government telegraphed the United Relief Headquarters on the 2nd, stating their opinions on the return of the Yellow River to its old course, pointing out that the four resolutions reached with the Kuomintang regarding the Yellow River's return to its old course were unsuccessful due to the Kuomintang's breach of faith and obstruction and sabotage of the levee restoration project. Recently, in addition to launching attacks, the Chiang faction has been actively blocking the breach, aiming to close it within two months, intending to flood our area. The telegram requested: (1) Resolutely implement the agreement of repairing the levees before closing the breach and releasing the water, and promptly allocate the outstanding payment of 800 million yuan for the first phase of the levee restoration project, 1,000 tons of flour, and the funds and materials for the second phase. (2) Promptly allocate 15 billion yuan for the relocation of riverbed residents. (3) The Kuomintang faction should fully compensate for the losses of labor, grain, materials, and equipment looted and destroyed during this offensive. (4) The Kuomintang faction should be responsible for ensuring that the ongoing river works and levee repairs are not disrupted, and that the repair materials are not looted during future military operations.
