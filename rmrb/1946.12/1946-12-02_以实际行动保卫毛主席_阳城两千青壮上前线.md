　　Protecting Chairman Mao with Practical Actions
    Two Thousand Strong Youths from Yangcheng Go to the Front Lines
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 27th] Two thousand five hundred strong young men from Yangcheng, with practical actions to protect the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and protect the people's savior Chairman Mao, enthusiastically joined Chairman Mao's People's Liberation Army. Wang Yuan, a model worker and deputy district chief of the Fifth District, personally mobilized a platoon to join the army. More than 550 people from the First and Second Districts have already joined the army. In the Third, Fourth, and Seventh Districts, 1,300 people from various villages registered to join the army in four days. Liu Jinyuan, a primary school teacher from the Second District, said when registering, "I am a Communist Party member, and I want to go to the front line to fight the Chiang troops and protect Chairman Mao." Cao Xiulan, secretary of the Women's Association in Dongshan, mobilized her own husband to join the army, guaranteeing that the women in the village would not hold him back, and organized women to produce for the families of soldiers. Xing Xueyun's maternal and paternal families had both suffered from the Central Army. Her husband and brother have all joined the army, and she guarantees to take care of the lives of both families. Li Qiu Wu Xiaokun's father was alive, so he sold all the land. At that time, he borrowed eighteen yuan, with an annual interest of eighteen dou. Unable to pay, he sold the land to the creditor, himself changing from creditor to tenant, forcing the whole family to flee famine for thirty-two years; now he has recovered his land and obtained an ox. He said, "We must protect our own fruits," and therefore voluntarily joined the army. The masses in Xigou in the First District told of the ten major sufferings under Chiang Kai-shek's rule: the suffering of exploitation, the suffering of corvée labor, the suffering of selling children, the suffering of starvation, the suffering of freezing to death, the suffering of selling wives, the suffering of selling mothers, the suffering of burdens, the suffering of beatings and scolding, the suffering of being slaves. They shouted, "Without Chairman Mao, there will be endless suffering!" Many people on the spot signed up to join the army to protect themselves and protect Chairman Mao.
