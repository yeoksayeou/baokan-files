Calling Out to Hero Wen Zhenming
	Wu Xiang

After a day and a night of fierce fighting, the famous Shangguan Village compound with its hundred gates had been captured by us. The brick walls were collapsing, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops retreated into another room, attempting to resist stubbornly. Wen Zhenming, carrying a hand grenade, rushed over and shouted, "Don't fight anymore! Sichuanese, don't sell your lives for Chiang Kai-shek!" Knowing that his words would certainly move the Chiang Kai-shek troops, he ran to the front of the house and shouted, "I'm also from the 41st Division, I was in the Transportation Battalion of the 122nd Brigade. I only came over to the Eighth Route Army in September from Taoyuan (northwest of Cao County), don't be afraid, everyone!" Applause erupted in the room. Wen Zhenming stuck his head into the door and said loudly, "I'm from Shunqing, Sichuan!" The Chiang Kai-shek troops, crammed into the room, looked at him with surprise and joy. A Chiang Kai-shek soldier near the door exclaimed, "I knew you were my fellow villager as soon as I heard your accent!" As he spoke, he hung his gun on Wen Zhenming's shoulder, and the others followed suit, hanging their guns on his shoulders, almost bending him over. He smiled and said, "Okay, okay, everyone is a fellow villager, don't worry. The benefits of the Eighth Route Army are too numerous to mention. Just look at me, and you'll know how happy the Eighth Route Army is." A Chiang Kai-shek soldier whispered in his ear, "The one in the corner is the regiment commander." He immediately shouted alertly for them to stand in formation outside and handed them over to the comrades in the company. This is a story from the Shangguan Village battle in Hua County, where the 41st Division's 104th Brigade was annihilated. In the Ren Village battle in Junan last month, Wen Zhenming won over four Chiang Kai-shek soldiers by shouting, and was selected as a combat hero. This time, forty-three Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers laid down their weapons at his call.

　　喊话英雄闻振明
    吴象
    经过一天一夜激战之后，上官村著名的有着一百个大门的大院落，已被我们攻占了。这座砖墙炸塌了，蒋军又缩进另一间屋子去企图负隅顽抗。闻振明提着手榴弹冲过去喊道：“不要打了，四川人不要替老蒋卖命。”他知道自己的话一定可以打动蒋军，便又跑到屋跟前喊：“我也是四十一师的，我在一二二旅辎重营，九月里从桃源（曹县西北）才到八路军这边来的，大家不要怕。”屋子里鼓起掌来，闻振明把头伸进门，大声说：“我是四川顺庆的。”横七竖八挤满了一屋子的蒋军又惊又喜的瞧着他。门边的一个蒋军叫道：“一听你口音，就知道是我的乡亲么”！说着，就把枪往他的肩上一挂，其他人也都接着把枪挂到他的肩上去，把他肩都压歪了，他笑着说：“好好，都是乡亲，都放心。八路军的好处一下也说不完，你们看看我，就知道八路军多痛快了。”一个蒋军跑到他耳朵上悄悄地说：“屋角里那一个是团长。”他立即机警地喊他们到屋外站队，分别交给连上的同志。这是歼灭四十一师一○四旅的滑县上官村战斗中的故事。上月鄄南任庄战斗，闻振明以喊话争取了四个蒋军，被选为战斗英雄。这次在他喊话下，放下武器的蒋军官兵又是四十三个。
