　　Che Yuan Corrects Complacency; Initial Successes in Winter Production
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The masses in Che Yuan Village, Fifth District, Licheng, have achieved initial success in winter production after correcting their complacency and ideas of winter idleness. After the autumn harvest, the village received the glorious title of "Model Village," which led to complacency among village cadres and the masses, who thought, "We are a model village," and "Half a year of hard work, half a year of leisure." They were not actively engaged in winter production. The district authorities discovered this problem and convened meetings of cadres and the masses on November 11th to get everyone thinking correctly. The cadres first made self-criticisms, saying, "A proud army is bound to be defeated; complacency will lead to the downfall of a model village!" The masses also reflected, "The land god in the deep mountains enjoys leisure but has little incense—a idle body means an empty stomach!" Finally, they all said, "Having been liberated and given land, we should actively engage in production to get rich." Thus, preparations for winter production began. The thirty-two mutual aid teams formed during the autumn harvest were reorganized into twenty sideline production teams. The thirty head of livestock were organized into a transportation team. In the twelve days from the 12th to the 24th, they made four trips and earned a net profit of 390,000 yuan, enough to buy 54.7 shi (石) and dou (斗) (30-jin dou) of millet, enough for the entire village to eat for twenty-five days. Currently, various sideline production teams are competing with each other, determined to achieve "one year's surplus for one year's consumption" for the entire village this winter. (Shao Yuan)

　　车元纠正自满思想
    冬季生产初获成绩
    【本报讯】黎城五区车元村群众，纠正了自满与冬闲思想后，冬季生产已获初步成绩。该村在秋收后得到了模范村的光荣称号，村干部和群众间产生了“咱是模范村”、“半年辛苦半年闲”的自满情绪，不积极进行冬季生产，区上发觉了这个问题，即于十一月十一号分别召开干部、群众大会，打通大家的思想。干部首先作了自我批评说：“骄兵必败，模范村自满就会垮台！”群众也反映：“深山土地爷，自在少香烟——身闲肚也闲！”最后都说：“翻身有了地，应该积极生产发家”，于是开始准备冬季生产。先将秋收时的三十二个互助组调整为二十个副业生产组。牲口三十头，编成一个运输队。从十二号开始至二十四号的十二天内，赶脚四趟净赚三十九万余元。可买小米五十四石七斗（三十斤斗），足够全村人口二十五天吃用。现各副业生产组正互相竞赛，决心于今冬生产中，做到全村全年耕一余一。（绍瑗）
