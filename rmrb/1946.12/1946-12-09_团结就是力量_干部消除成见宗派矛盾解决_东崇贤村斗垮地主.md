    Unity is Strength
    Cadres Eliminate Prejudices, Resolve Factional Conflicts
    Dongchongxian Village Overthrows Landlords
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch on the 7th] In Dongchongxian Village, an old district in Huguan, the phenomenon of disunity between cadres and the masses was resolved, and they marched towards the feudal landlords with one heart, opening up a sluggish work situation. This village was at the focal point of the struggle between the enemy, the stubborn elements, and us after the December coup. There were three governments existing simultaneously. In 1942, the enemy and stubborn regime were overthrown, work was initiated, and a group of cadres emerged, but at that time, some cadres had a poor work style and did not pay attention to mobilizing the masses. During the rent reduction in 1944, the leadership paid attention to mobilizing the masses and criticized a few cadres. A group of new cadres emerged during the movement. The old cadres relied on their seniority, and the new cadres were afraid of being criticized and dared not work boldly. The masses all said, "Chongxian is three li long (the village is more than three li long), with a Guanyin temple every li." Each street engaged in factionalism, and the landlord Su Panghai took the opportunity to exploit the contradictions and attack activists. Recently, after inspection, three problems were discovered: (1) The distribution of the fruits of struggle was unfair, the new and old cadres were not convinced by each other, and were not united. The leadership gave more criticism and less encouragement to the old cadres, causing the old cadres to feel discouraged and unmotivated. (2) The leadership believed that the middle peasants were unreliable, and kept more than 100 middle peasant households in the village outside the farmers' association. Some activists were attacked in the 1944 movement, and the poor peasants and farm laborers were isolated. (3) There were more than 40 immigrant households in the village. The landlord spread rumors saying, "If the 'old ash burners' (a derogatory term for people from Henan) rise up, it will be terrible." This created disunity between the local and immigrant households. Only then did the leadership realize that the main reason for the lack of enthusiasm in work was the internal strife among the cadres and the disunity among the peasants. They decided to solve the cadre problem first. The district cadres first made self-criticisms, and used individual conversations and mutual criticism methods to make everyone realize that we are all one family and should not engage in disunity. Public Security Director Yan Songlin said, "We are engaging in disunity because of some small things. It is truly painful that spies and landlords have taken advantage of this." After the cadres united, they focused on the feudal landlords' instigation and the losses suffered by the peasants, carried out class education, and inspired the masses, shifting the hatred to the feudal landlords. After awakening, peasant Jiang Chengshui said, "I am Panghai's uncle. Using his money, I was still forced to flee and live in Xifu for several years. Not to mention the locals versus the outsiders, I see that he oppresses anyone as long as they are poor." On the basis of the awakening of the masses, everyone united and launched a liquidation struggle. After a month, five households of local bullies and landlords, including Su Panghai, were liquidated. The masses recovered 128.6 mu of land, 71 houses, 11 buildings, 17 kilns, and 198 shi of grain. The poor military families, cadre families, retired veterans, and middle and poor peasants all received the fruits of the struggle. The poor peasants rose to become middle peasants, and the entire village was completely transformed. (Zhixian)

    团结就是力量
　　干部消除成见宗派矛盾解决
    东崇贤村斗垮地主
    【本报长治七日电】壶关老区东崇贤村，解决干部与群众间不团结的现象，一致向封建地主进军，打开工作消沉的局面。该村在十二月政变后即处于敌顽我斗争的焦点，曾有三种政府同时存在。四二年打垮敌顽政权，开辟了工作，产生了一批干部，但当时一部分干部作风不好，未注意发动群众。四四年减租时，领导上曾注意了发动群众，对少数干部给予批评，在运动中产生了一批新干部，老干部倚老卖老，新干部怕受批评，不敢大胆工作。群众都说：“崇贤拉的三里长（该村有三里多长），一里一个观音堂。”各街互相闹宗派，地主苏胖孩乘机利用矛盾，打击积极分子。最近经过检查，发现三个问题：（一）分配斗争果实不公，新老干部互不服气，互不团结，领导上对老干部批评多，鼓励少，使老干部感到恢心，干着没劲。（二）领导上认为中农不可靠，把全村一百多户中农关在农会门外，在四四年运动中有些积极分子曾受到打击，贫佃农孤立。（三）该村有四十多家外来户，地主造谣说：“叫老烧灰（骂河南人）起来可了不得。”造成本地户与外来户不团结。领导上至此才认识了干部互相闹意见与农民内部不团结，是工作不起劲的主要原因，乃决定首先解决干部问题。区干部先做检讨，并用个别谈话，互相批评的方法，使大家认识到咱们都是一家人，不应该闹不团结。公安主任阎松林说：“咱们因为些小事情闹不团结。叫特务地主钻了空子，实在痛心。”干部团结后即抓紧封建地主的挑拨与农民受到的损失，进行阶级教育、启发群众，把仇恨转到封建地主身上。农民蒋成水觉悟后说：“我是胖孩的舅舅，使他的钱，照样逼得不能在家，逃到西府住了几年，不用说本地人外路人，我看只要是穷人，他就欺压。”在群众觉悟的基础上，大家团结了，即展开清算斗争。经过一月的时间，清算了苏胖孩等五户恶霸地主，群众收回土地一百二十八亩六分，房七十一间，楼十一间，窑十七座，粮食一百九十八石，贫苦军属干属，荣退军人，中贫农都得到了果实，贫农上升为中农，全村彻底翻了身。（志献）
