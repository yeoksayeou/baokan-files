(From our newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 14th) The Industry and Commerce Bureau of the Second Sub-district, in view of the encroachment of American goods into the inland market, the rise of the legal tender (fabi), unstable prices, and unscrupulous merchants taking the opportunity to smuggle and manipulate, leading to reduced tax revenue, in order to save the collapse of small handicrafts and strengthen industrial and commercial work, has specially stipulated measures for market management in wartime: 1. In guerrilla areas, industrial and commercial cadres should be organized into armed work teams and guerrilla teams to carry out guerrilla warfare, eliminate and combat small groups of enemies, protect people's property, and stabilize social order. When order is stable, opportunities should be seized to carry out market management, strictly prevent the intrusion of American goods, and restore the national industry and commerce of our liberated areas. 2. In areas bordering the enemy, concentrate forces and mobilize the masses to suppress smuggling. Better administrators and traders can be drawn to organize into anti-smuggling groups, directly controlled and led by personnel dispatched by the county bureau. Illegal goods should be appropriately handled according to the severity of the circumstances. 3. In markets that have not fallen into enemy hands, the intrusion of American goods and smuggling and tax evasion must be resolutely eliminated. In transactions, local currency must be used, and barter trade and silver transactions must be banned. Strengthen the education of traders and stabilize their emotions, so as to stabilize market order and consolidate the credit of the local currency. 4. In general newly recovered market areas, such as Yuncheng and Juan counties, because the Chiang Kai-shek's and puppet troops once occupied them, and American goods were rampant, after we recovered them, we should not suddenly confiscate them, but should try to handle them properly.

　　加强战时集市管理
    冀鲁豫二分区工商局规定办法
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】二分区工商局鉴于美货侵入内地市场，法币抬头，物价不稳，奸商乘机走私、操纵，税收减少，为挽救小手工业的垮台，加强工商工作，特规定战争情况下的集市管理办法：一、在游击区，将工商干部应组织到武工队和游击队里面去，开展游击战争，消灭和打击小股敌人，保护群众财产，稳定社会秩序。在秩序稳定的情况下，应抓紧机会，进行市场管理，严格制止美货侵入，恢复我解放区民族工业商业。二、接敌区集中力量，发动群众缉私，可抽较好的管理员和交易员，组织到缉私组里去，由县局派员直接掌握领导，对于非法货物，根据情节轻重，予以适当处理。三、在未沦陷的集市，要坚决肃清美货侵入以及走私漏税现象。在交易上一律通过本位币，取缔以物易物及白银交易。加强交易员的教育，稳定交易员的情绪，以稳定市场秩序，巩固本币信用。四、在一般新收复区集市，如郓、鄄等县，因为蒋伪军曾经一度盘据，美货充斥，我们收复后，不要骤然进行没收，应设法妥予处理。
