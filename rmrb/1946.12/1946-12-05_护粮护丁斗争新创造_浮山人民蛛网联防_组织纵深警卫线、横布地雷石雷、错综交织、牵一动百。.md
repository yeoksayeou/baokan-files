[This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd dispatch] The people of Fushan, in order to actively strike at the Chiang-Yan troops besieging the city who were raiding for grain and conscripting recruits, launched a struggle to protect grain and defend recruits. Taking the enemy-occupied Fushan county town as the center, from all directions of east, west, north, and south, according to the natural terrain and roads, village-to-village joint defense was implemented, organizing several vertical guard lines that penetrated deeply into the villages near the county town. Each route, about seven or eight *li*, was divided into sections, each section with guard posts to monitor the enemy. Several horizontal iron and stone battle lines (landmines and stone mines) were also formed, with landmines and stone mines densely buried along each battle line. All intersections were constantly guarded by field militia, forming a warning line that intersected with the horizontal iron and stone battle lines, creating a heavy encirclement around the Chiang troops in Fushan like a spiderweb. When the enemy sallied forth, the entire network was activated, subjecting them to annihilation by the joint village defense militia. On the 7th of last month, the Chiang army headquarters in Fushan city sent out about fifty or sixty men, heading towards Linfen along the Linfushan Highway. Passing near the city, hand grenades and signal flares alerted the joint villages. The militia of each battle line rushed to Zhao Zhuang Bridge, buried stone mines, and gathered militia at the intersections of each battle line to block the enemy. When the Chiang army arrived at Zhao Zhuang Bridge, they rested and triggered a stone mine. With a thunderous crash, a Chiang army regimental-level officer was blown to pieces, and the remaining Chiang soldiers fled. However, wherever they went, they were subjected to cold gunfire from the militia along the way. The Chiang army only caught their breath when they reached Xihan Village. They asked the villagers, "How big are the stone mines buried at Zhao Zhuang Bridge? How could they be so powerful?!" They also asked, "Which unit was shooting along the way?" The people said it was the militia, but they still didn't quite believe it. On the 12th of last month, a "revenge squad" of more than twenty Chiang soldiers came out of the city to seize grain, and again traveled to Zhao Zhuang Bridge, where more than fifty militiamen from the 4th and 5th districts, alerted by the alarm, came to encircle and block them. The battle lasted about an hour. The Chiang army's reinforcement troops of more than one hundred and twenty men, carrying four machine guns, attacked the militia. Because the militia was growing in number and fighting more vigorously, the battle lasted for four hours, eventually routing the Chiang army, killing and wounding five enemies, while the militia suffered no casualties.

    【本报太岳三日电】浮山人民为积极打击围困城内蒋阎军的抢粮抓丁出扰部队，展开了护粮保丁斗争。以敌占的浮山县城为中心，从东西南北各方，按自然地形与道路，实行村村联防，组织成数条纵的警卫线，深入到县城附近各村，每条路线上约七、八里分做一段，每段各有警卫岗哨监视敌人，又组成数条横的铁石战线（地雷石雷），各个战线都丛密的埋藏地雷石雷，各路口都有野战民兵经常把守着的警戒线，和横着铁石战线互相交错着，像蛛网式的对浮山蒋军形成重重包围圈。敌人出扰，牵动全网，遭受联村联防民兵歼灭打击。上月七日浮山城内蒋军司令部约五、六十人出城，沿临浮公路向临汾出发，经城附近，手榴弹烟火报告联村，各战线民兵赶忙到赵庄桥，把石雷埋好，又向各战线路口集合民兵，阻击敌人。蒋军到赵庄桥时，因为休息，触发石雷，霹雳一声，把蒋军一个团级军官炸成肉泥，其余蒋军逃窜而去；但每到一地，即遭受沿路民兵冷枪射击，蒋军直跑到西韩村，才换气。问老乡说：“赵庄桥埋的石雷有多么大，怎么这么历害”！！又问：“是那部分队伍沿路打枪”？老百姓说是民兵，他们还是不大相信。上月十二日蒋军“复仇队”二十余人出城抢粮，又行至赵庄桥，为惊号集合起来的”、四、五区民兵五十余人，前来包围阻击，战争约一小时，城内蒋军增援部队一百二十余人，携机枪四挺，向民兵攻击，因民兵越来越多越打越起劲，战斗延长四小时之久，终将蒋军击溃，毙伤敌五名，民兵一无损伤。
