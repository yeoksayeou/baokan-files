　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 14th dispatch] The Taiyue agencies are filled with the heroic, intense, arduous, and united spirit called for by Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Comrade Liu Shaoqi. After Comrade Li Zheren conveyed the call of Zhu and Liu on the 2nd, all agencies and organizations launched discussions, and linked them to the work of their departments and their own thoughts to conduct thorough examinations and reflections. The Taiyue Administrative Office has launched in-depth reflections from the bottom up, from work to ideology. When discussing saving manpower, materials, and financial resources to support the front lines, past wasteful phenomena were discovered. Based on this, institutions were immediately streamlined and manpower was saved to meet the needs of the war. For example, in the printing section, where three people used to work, the number has now been reduced to two, and work efficiency has actually doubled. The entire agency is currently continuing to conduct in-depth reflections. The General Assembly of the Armed Forces Committee, through reflections from the collective to the individual, discovered that some people formerly had the spirit to heroically sacrifice and struggle arduously, but now, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they were afraid of sacrifice. However, after listening to the report, everyone was greatly enlightened ideologically. For example, comrade Tian Fengrang, a feeder, said: "We can no longer say that life is bad. The comrades at the front still have to heroically sacrifice, so we must save some food to send to the front." After each comrade reflected, they immediately formulated their own work plans. For example, in the past, they worked one and a half hours in the evening, but now it has been changed to two and a half hours, and they are determined to do their work well. In terms of living standards, the daily food allowance for each person has been reduced from thirty yuan to twenty-five yuan. In the past, three people's rations were wasted at each meal, but now it has all been corrected. Even the coal burned by each family is carried by the cadres themselves. The Jinnan Bank branch, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Public Security District Bureau, the Post Office, the Tax Bureau, etc., also started with examining their ideology. After half a month, great results have been achieved. After a major inspection by various agencies, the style of work has changed.
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th dispatch] The staff of the Taiyue Xinhua Daily and Xinhua Branch, after listening to Comrade Li Zheren's current affairs report on the 30th of last month, launched discussions, discovered and resolved some ideological problems in self-reflection, and began to show progress in their work. In self-criticism, it was discovered that a small number of comrades had two extreme ideas: one was a fantasy of peace, believing that one day they would receive a sudden urgent telegram, and Chiang Kai-shek would really order a ceasefire. The other was that the war was far off and indefinite, and therefore a mentality of getting by and enjoying whatever they could developed in these comrades. They were unwilling to suffer hardship and afraid of danger, resulting in phenomena such as disobeying transfers and wasting resources. Some comrades said: "I felt that I had survived the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, and now I am asked to work on the front lines again, and I am unwilling." Some comrades said: "In the past, I was not active in my work. In fact, seven days were enough to complete a month's work." After everyone's in-depth reflection and discussion, "thanks" to Chiang Kai-shek for convening the "National Assembly" and breaking the illusion of peace, they realized that they were currently "climbing the mountain top", overcame the above two ideas, and thus their confidence was boosted and work efficiency began to increase. For example, the distribution department organized seven book-carrying teams to sell books in the countryside, and now six people are maintaining the work of the previous thirteen. The overall living standard of the entire agency has been reduced by 20 percent. Each person's monthly meat consumption has been reduced from two jin to one jin. The telecommunications section has reduced its monthly consumption of seven dozen pencils to three dozen. Comrades in the serial publication editorial department guarantee that they will complete 100% of their work tasks in the future, and propose that in the future, they should not only obey orders, but also frequently give themselves orders to motivate themselves. The worker comrades have also launched a work competition since the 10th to welcome the model worker movement, guaranteeing a 20 percent increase in output.

　　英勇·紧张·艰苦·团结
    太岳各机关建立新作风
    联系部门工作确实检查思想
    消灭浪费现象全力支援前线
    【本报太岳十四日电】太岳各机关充满了朱总司令、刘少奇同志号召的英勇、紧张、艰苦、团结作风。二日李哲人同志传达朱刘号召后，各机关团体纷纷展开讨论，并联系部门工作和自己的思想，进行确实的检查与反省。太岳行署已由下至上从工作到思想展开深入的反省；在讨论到节约人力、物力、财力支援前线时，发现了过去的浪费现象，据此随即紧缩机构，节省人力以适合战争需要；如文印股过去三个人工作，现在减为两个人，工作效率反而提高一倍。目前全机关正继续深入反省。武委总会由全体到个人反省中，发现出思想中有过去能英勇牺牲艰苦奋斗，而今抗战胜利害怕牺牲，但听了报告后给大家思想上很大启示。如饲养员田丰让同志说：“可不再说生活坏了，前方同志还要英勇牺牲，我们要节约些粮食送前方去。”每个同志反省以后，随即订出自己的工作计划。如过去，晚上办公一时半，现在改为两时半，并决心要把工作作好。在生活上，过去每人每天三十元菜金，现减为二十五元。过去每顿饭要浪费三个人的火食，现都改正了。连各家烧的煤炭都是干部自己担的。冀南银行分行、工商局、公安区局、邮局、税局等亦是先从检查思想着手，经过半月的时间，收到成绩很大。各机关经过大检查后，工作作风有了转变。
    【本报太岳十五日电】太岳新华日报与新华分社职工，于上月三十日听了李哲人同志时事报告后，展开讨论，在自我反省中发现与解决了一些思想问题，并开始表现在工作上的进步。在自我检讨中发现少数同志存在着两个极端的思想；一是幻想和平，认为总有一天会接到突然的急电，蒋介石真的下令停战。一是认为战争是遥遥无期，因之在这些同志中滋生着一种得过且过，得享受且享受的心里，不愿吃苦，生怕危险，以至形成不服从调动、浪费等现象。有的同志说：“我以前感到八年抗战熬过来了，现在又要我上前线工作，我就不愿意。”有的同志说：“过去我工作不积极，事实上一月的工作有七天就可作完”。经过大家深刻反省讨论，“感谢”蒋介石召开“国大”打破了和平幻想，认识目前是“爬山顶”，克服了上述两种思想，于是信心提高，工作效率开始增大。如发行部即组织了七付书担，下乡卖书，现由六个人坚持过去十三人的工作。现全社生活水平普遍减低百分之二十，每人每月由吃二斤肉减为一斤，电务科由每月用七打铅笔减为三打，丛刊编辑部同志保证今后百分之百的完成工作任务，并提出今后不仅要服从命令，而且要自己经常给自己下命令，以督励自己。工友同志更自十日起，展开工作竞赛，迎接劳模运动，保证提高产量百分之二十。
