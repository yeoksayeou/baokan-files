Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 9th: Landlord Zhang Zhaoxun from Cengshanhou Village, 11th District, North Qiu County, Zouzhen (Xin County), Southern Shandong, was awarded the title of "Support Model." When Chiang's troops attacked Southern Shandong last month, he was motivated by righteous indignation and brought three days' worth of food and a large cotton-padded coat, voluntarily signing up for the stretcher team. He worked very conscientiously and diligently at the front lines, which was unanimously recognized by everyone. After finishing his duties, he encountered a wounded soldier on the way back and, disregarding his fatigue, found a companion to carry the wounded soldier to the rear. He took good care of him along the way. When the wounded soldier was cold, he immediately took off his large coat to cover him. When he was thirsty, he personally boiled hot water for him to drink. At a certain unit's support model election conference, the comrades of the unit and the laborers unanimously praised his exemplary behavior and elected him as a support model. The chairman of the conference put a big red flower on him and also awarded him a support certificate printed with Chairman Mao's image. He was very moved and said to everyone, "I am a landlord. During the reasonable settlement, the village took care of my livelihood and left my family more than three mu of good land per person. This year's autumn harvest yielded more than two dou of sorghum per mu, which is better than others. My eldest son also works for the public, so our life is still prosperous. If Chiang's troops come, no one will survive. I can't go to the front lines to fight him, so it is my responsibility to do some support work."
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th: Yu Long's family, a landlord from Yujiatun, Nongan, who had fled, once escaped to Changchun. He has now returned and also participated in the local work of the democratic government. Leng Wenbi from Xihebao, a landlord with more than 300 hectares of land, has also returned from Changchun. It is said that after they arrived in Changchun, their son was conscripted by Chiang's troops for training as a "National Soldier," and that the taxes and levies in the KMT-controlled areas were heavy and the cost of living was high, making it impossible to live. Looking back, they saw that the liberated areas took care of the landlords and kept their land for them, so they happily returned.

    积极支援前线打蒋贼
    地主张兆勋荣获模范
    农安地主于龙家回头参加我工作
    【新华社山东九日电】鲁南走溱（新县）原邱县北部十一区层山后村地主张兆勋，荣获“支援模范”。上月蒋军进攻鲁南时，他激于义愤，带了三天粮食一件大袄，自动报名参加担架队，在前线工作非常认真刻苦，为大家一致公认。公毕回后，于途中遇一伤员，他就不顾疲劳找同伴将该伤员抬往后方。一路上他很好照顾，伤员冷了，马上把大袄脱下给盖上，口渴了，亲自烧热水给喝。此次某部在选举支援模范大会上，部队同志及民夫一致赞扬他的模范行为，选他为支援模范。大会主席给他戴上大红花，还奖他印有毛主席像的支援奖状。他很受感动，并向大家说：“我是一个地主，在讲理清算时，村里就照顾到我的生活，给我家每人留有三亩多好地，今年秋收每亩收了二斗多高粱，比人家收成好。大儿又在公家做事，生活仍然富裕。蒋军来了大家都不得活，我不能上前线跟他拚，作点支援工作是我的责任。”
    【新华社东北九日电】逃亡出外的农安于家屯地主于龙家，曾逃至长春，日前回来了，还参加了民主政府地方工作。西和堡的冷文毕是三百多垧地的地主，现在也从长春回来了。据称他们到了长春后，儿子被蒋军拉去受训当“国兵”，并谓蒋管区捐税重，生活程度高，无法生活。回头看看解放区照顾地主，并留有他们的土地，因此就喜悦的回来了。
