　　Tenth Anniversary of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Entering Yan'an
    Yan'an Citizens Celebrate Joyfully
    From desolate and miserable in the past to prosperous and wealthy today. The citizens' love for Yan'an has further increased their determination to defend Yan'an.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army entering Yan'an city, and citizens hung national flags everywhere to celebrate.
    Ten years ago, General Zhang Xueliang, under the pressure of Chiang Kai-shek, entered northern Shaanxi to "suppress the communists". After a division was wiped out in the Battle of Laoshan, from May 1935, the remaining two divisions were trapped in Yan'an city, surrounded by the Red Army and the Red Guards. They went to the mountain gullies one or two miles outside the city to collect firewood, and even with the protection of one or two companies, they were often completely disarmed. When food and grass were cut off, one division broke through to Yichuan, and two regiments fled to Anding. The remaining troops defending the city smashed the school desks and chairs for firewood, and food relied on airplanes from Xi'an for supply. In the severe cold nights, the Red Guards knocked on the city gates with guns to demonstrate, shouting slogans such as "Stop the civil war, unite to resist Japan, and return home!" The sentries, shivering in their thin clothes, often wept bitterly, and more and more soldiers deserted and surrendered to us. By February 1936, Bu Shifang, the chief of staff and commander of the city defense of the defending army, had to sign a truce agreement with Li Jinglin, our commander of the besieging army. Under the principle of united resistance against Japan, they were allowed to restore traffic from Yan'an to Xi'an. We also supplemented their food, firewood, salt, etc.
    Five days after the "Double Twelfth" Incident, Xi'an sent a plane to pick up Comrade Zhou Enlai, and the defending troops in the city also withdrew at the same time. Gao Jingshang, the Kuomintang county magistrate of Xi'an, ran to the airport to ask for help, but the pilot said, "We are here to pick up the Red Army, we don't need you." Gao then returned to the city crestfallen. But the masses had already destroyed the county government office, frightening him to flee quickly. That night, the masses also destroyed the Kuomintang county party headquarters and celebrated wildly all night, celebrating their liberation. On November 18th, the masses spontaneously gathered and established the "Yan'an All Circles People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association", sending more than 200 representatives to the north gate to welcome the Red Army into the city.
    When the Red Army entered the city, it was desolate and miserable. There were only 67 shops, but there were as many as 83 opium dens. Among the more than 3,000 people, there were as many as 1,200 opium addicts, and vagrants and beggars were everywhere. But ten years later, the number of shops in the city has increased to 818. The previously desolate city gate is now a prosperous new market, more than ten miles long from north to south, built on what was once a ghost ditch full of graves. The city's population has increased to 15,000 citizens, beggars have disappeared, and all opium addicts have been reformed. Two-thirds of the families in the city have more than a year's supply of grain.
    Yesterday, citizens crowded in front of the blackboard newspapers in the new market, reading commemorative articles and front-line victories. From morning to night, there was an endless stream of people. They talked about the changes between these ten years, and their love for Yan'an further increased their confidence in defending Yan'an. In the Yan'an Self-Defense Army's grand exercises and the evening celebration party, everyone unanimously expressed: Hu Zongnan's army can only be taken prisoner, and they should not even think about stepping into Yan'an city!

　　工农红军进入延安十周年
    延安市民欢欣庆祝
    相当年荒凉凄惨，到如今繁华富裕。市民们对延安的热爱，更增加了他们保卫延安的决心。
    【新华社延安十九日电】昨日为陕北工农红军进入延安城十周年纪念日，市民遍挂国旗祝贺。
    十年前张学良将军在蒋介石逼迫进入陕北“剿共”，在劳山战斗中被歼一师后，从一九三五年五月起其余两个师即困守延安城，红军和赤卫军在城外团团包围。他们到城外一二里的山沟打柴，虽有一两连人保护仍常被全部缴械。在粮草断绝下，一个师突围逃至宜川，两个团逃至安定，留下的守城军把学校的桌凳都打烂作柴烧，食物依靠西安派飞机接济。严寒的夜里，赤卫军在城门外用枪敲门示威，高呼“停止内战，一致抗日，打回老家去！”等口号，穿着单衣全身抖缩着的哨兵，常常痛哭流涕，士兵逃跑向我投诚者日众。到三六年二月，守城军参谋长兼城防司令布士芳只得向我围城司令李景林签订停战协定。在一致抗日原则下让他们恢复延安至西安的交通。我们并补足他们粮食柴盐等。
    “双十二”事变后五天，西安派飞机来迎接周恩来同志，城里守军亦同时撤退。西安国民党县长高景尚跑到飞机场去求援，飞机师说：“我们来接红军的，不要你。”高乃垂头丧气回城。但群众已将县衙门全部捣毁，骇得他赶快逃跑。当晚，群众并将国民党县党部捣毁，狂欢竟夜，庆祝翻身解放。——十一月十八，群众自动集会，成立“延安各界群众抗日救国会”，派代表二百多人到北门外去欢迎红军入城。
    红军入城时，满城荒凉凄惨。店铺只六十七家，但大烟馆即有八十三家。三千多人口中，烟民即达一千二百多，流氓乞丐满街皆是。但十年后全市商店已增至八百一十八家。以前荒凉的城关。现在建筑起的房屋，南北长十余里繁华的新市场，即是当年坟墓垒垒的鬼沟。现全市人口仅市民已增至万五千人，乞丐绝迹，烟民全被改造。全市三分之二人家，均有一年余粮。
    昨日市民们拥挤在新市场黑板报前，读着纪念文和前方捷报。从早到晚，络绛不绝。他们谈论着这十年前后的变化，对延安的热爱，更加增加了他们保卫延安的信心。在延市自卫军大操中，与入夜的庆祝晚会上，大家都一致表示：胡宗南军队除了当俘虏以外，休想踏进延安城！
