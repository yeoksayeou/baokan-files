　　【Report from our Licheng correspondent】The Licheng County Cooperative's Textile Factory has created Ten-Scenery Homespun Fabric, and merchants and ordinary people are vying to purchase it. The factory was established in September of this year. Under the leadership and management of Manager Wang Yusen and Technician Wang Pengzhang, all employees unanimously put forward resounding slogans such as "Improve and transform textile technology, resist American goods." In the past two months, they have created twill large-flower quilt covers, twill five-color flower mattress covers, and other Ten-Scenery Homespun Fabrics such as checkered flowers, snakeskin flowers, and willow branches. Their solid quality and novel patterns are comparable to foreign cloth. Therefore, ordinary people are vying to buy them. Flower cloth quilt covers and mattress covers are often bought by customers before they even come off the machine. An old woman of sixty from Kendong Village, buying a wedding quilt and mattress for her son, personally went to the factory to tell the manager: "Look, this flower cloth is both strong and beautiful, much better than foreign goods! We will never buy foreign goods again in the future." (Shuan Long, Anshun, Yi Qing)

　　十景土布上市  人人争相购买
    【本报黎城讯】黎城县联社纺织厂创造出十景土布，商人、百姓争相讲买。该厂今年九月创立，在王雨森经理、王捧章技师的领导与经营下，全体职工，一致提出“提高和改造纺织技术，抵制美货”等响亮口号。两月以来，已创造出斜纹大花儿被面，斜纹五色花褥面，及其他方格花、蛇皮花、柳条儿等十景土布。其质量坚实与花样新颖，可与洋布相匹敌。故老百姓争相购买、花儿布被面、褥面，常常是不等下机，就被顾主买走了。坑东村一个六十岁的老太太为她儿子买结婚被、褥，亲自跑去该厂给经理说：“你瞧，这花布又结实，又好看，比洋货强的多！以后咱再不买洋货啦”。（拴龙、安顺、翼卿）
