[This report from our newspaper's correspondent in Weixian, dated the 6th] In some areas of Southern Hebei, a "pulling members" phenomenon has been discovered in the development of organizations, and the leadership is already paying attention to correcting it. The Qi Zhi County Party Committee, at a mass movement review meeting, discovered that some villages were developing organizations in a "pulling members" style, creating ideological disunity and giving opportunists the chance to infiltrate various organizations. In a certain village in the third district of Daming, in order to complete the organization of the majority of the masses, names were written down household by household "as being in the association," writing down more than 200 people in one day. In the fourth district of Qiu County, when developing organizations before the rent reduction, it was discovered that some villages proposed "every household must participate in one kind of organization; whoever does not participate will not be accepted." In the fifth district of Yuanchao, many of the newly developed members in Maling Village were pulled in to participate. After discovering this deviation, the local leadership has instructed all villages to emphasize that, in order to truly organize the majority of the masses, in-depth mobilization must be carried out in the movement, so that the masses can understand the need to organize and voluntarily participate in various organizations. In order to thoroughly achieve filling in gaps and making up deficiencies, 180 mass leaders in the seventh district of Wuxun gathered to arrange a large-scale review of emancipation. Everyone unanimously believed that the masses had not been well mobilized. First, the middle peasants were struggled against, causing them to be afraid and not follow us. Second, the village cadres monopolized the struggle, not consulting with each group, and acting as the boss themselves. In some villages, struggle meetings were held, and the masses still didn't know what was going on. After reflection and discussion, five resolutions were unanimously passed: 1. Thoroughly liquidate the landlords and despots, and recover the exploited land; 2. Absolutely do not infringe upon the interests of the middle peasants, unite the poor and lower-middle peasants, and settle accounts with the landlords together; 3. Thoroughly realize "land to the tiller," so that everyone has land to cultivate and food to eat; 4. Women must be brought along; 5. Resolutely follow Chairman Mao.

　　强调参加组织自觉自愿企之等地纠正拉夫现象
    【本报威县六日电】冀南部份地区，在发展组织中，发现“拉夫”现象，领导上已经注意纠正。企之县委在群运检讨会上，发现有些村庄以拉夫式发展组织，造成思想不统一，给投机分子钻进各种组织的机会。大名三区某村为完成组织群众大多数，挨户写名“在会”，一天中写了二百多人。邱县四区在查减前发展组织时，发现有的村提出“每户必须参加一种组织，谁不参加不中”。元朝五区马陵村新发展的会员中很多是被拉参加。各地领导上发现这个偏向后，均已指示各村，强调指出为真正组织群众大多数，在运动中必须进行深入动员，要做到群众思想上认识组织起来的需要，自觉自愿参加各种组织。为彻底达到填平补齐，武训七区一百八十名群众领袖集会，布置翻身大检查。大家一致认为，群众还没有发动好。第一、斗了中农，致中农害怕，不跟着咱走。第二、村干包办斗争，不和各小组商量，自己硬当家，有的村开斗争会，群众还不知道干啥哩。经过反省讨论后，一致通过五项决议：一、彻底清算地主恶霸，把剥削的土地追回来；二、绝不侵犯中农利益，中贫农大团结，齐向地主算账；三、彻底实现“耕者有其田”，大家有地种有饭吃；四、要把妇女带起来；五、坚决跟着毛主席走。
