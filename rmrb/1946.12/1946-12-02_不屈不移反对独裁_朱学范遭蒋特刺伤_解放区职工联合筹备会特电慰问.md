　　Unyielding in Opposition to Dictatorship
  　Zhu Xuefan Stabbed by Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Agents
  　Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Areas' Trade Union Federation Sends Special Telegram of Condolence
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 29th] Nanjing Dispatch: Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association and Executive Committee Member of the International Federation of Trade Unions, was stabbed by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents on Queen's Road in Hong Kong on the 25th, suffering serious injuries. Mr. Zhu stated on the 16th that he refused to participate in the illegal "National Assembly." The Chiang government was dissatisfied with this move. When he left Shanghai, the Chiang government intended to arrest and assassinate him. His departure from Shanghai to Hong Kong was also due to the dangerous situation.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 29th] After news of the assassination attempt on Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, reached here, the Preparatory Committee of the China Liberated Areas Trade Union Federation and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Trade Union jointly sent a telegram of condolence. The telegram stated:
    To Mr. Zhu Xuefan in Hong Kong: We are extremely indignant to hear that you were assassinated and seriously injured by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in Hong Kong. As the leader of the China Labor Association, you have worked tirelessly for national independence, democracy, and the unity and welfare of the working class. Recently, you resolutely refused to participate in Chiang's pseudo-National Assembly and rejected Chiang Kai-shek's unreasonable anti-communist demands. Your unyielding and righteous spirit is admired by people at home and abroad. The traitorous and dictatorial ringleader Chiang Kai-shek hates you even more, and after failing to coax, intimidate, and suppress you, he has resorted to the final vicious act of assassinating you. This insane action of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule can only accelerate its own collapse, and your assassination will call upon the nation's workers and people to unite and awaken even more, and to strengthen their determination to fight for independence and democracy. We are deeply concerned about your injuries and hope for your speedy recovery so that you can continue to fight for the final victory. The million workers in the liberated areas pledge to be your staunch support.
    Cui Tianfu, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Liberated Areas Trade Union Federation and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Trade Union, November 28th.

　　不屈不移反对独裁
  　朱学范遭蒋特刺伤
  　解放区职工联合筹备会特电慰问
    【新华社延安十一月二十九日电】南京讯：中国劳动协会理事长国际职工联合会执行委员朱学范氏，于二十五日在香港皇后大道被蒋介石特务刺伤，伤势颇为严重。朱氏十六日声明，即已指出他拒绝参加非法“国大”，蒋政府对他此举不满，他在离沪时蒋政府即有逮捕及暗害打算，他离沪赴港，亦系因形势危险。
    【新华社延安十一月二十九日电】中国劳协理事长朱学范氏在港遇刺消息传至此间后，中国解放区职工联合会筹备会及陕甘宁边区职工会即联名驰电慰问。原电称：
    香港朱学范先生：惊闻先生在港遭蒋介石特务暗算，身受重伤，我们万分愤慨。先生领导劳协，为国家独立民主与工人阶级的团结和福利奋斗不懈，最近更毅然拒绝参加蒋记伪国大，拒绝接受蒋介石的无理反共要求，不屈不移，大义凛然，中外人士，同声景仰；而卖国独裁头子蒋介石就更恨你入骨，于哄你、吓你、压你不成之后，不能不下最后的毒手来暗害你。蒋介石独裁统治的此种疯狂行动，只能加速其自身的崩溃，而你的被刺，则将号召全国职工与全国人民更加团结与觉醒，更加坚定为独立民主而奋斗的决心。我们对你的负伤不胜系念，希望早日康复，继续奋斗，争取最后胜利，解放区百万职工誓作你的后盾。
    中国解放区职工会筹备会主任陕甘宁边区职工会崔田夫十一月二十八日。
