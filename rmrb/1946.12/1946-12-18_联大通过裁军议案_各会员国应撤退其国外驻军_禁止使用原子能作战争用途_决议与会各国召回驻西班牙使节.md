Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 15th: New York dispatch: The resolution on general principles for the adjustment and reduction of armaments was unanimously adopted amidst cheers at the United Nations General Assembly on the 14th. The resolution stipulates: (1) The General Assembly recognizes the necessity of a general resolution on the reduction of armies and armaments; (2) The General Assembly recommends to the Security Council that it immediately formulate various plans and measures to achieve the goal of adjusting and reducing armaments (including the control of atomic energy); (3) After the above-mentioned plans are formulated by the Security Council, they will be submitted to a special session of the General Assembly for approval, and then approved by the member states; (4) The General Assembly recommends that the Security Council draft one or more treaties stipulating the prohibition and elimination of the use of atomic energy for military purposes, and the establishment of an international control and monitoring system for atomic energy for peaceful purposes, to protect member states that abide by the treaty from the threat of those who violate the treaty; (5) The General Assembly instructs all member states to gradually withdraw their troops stationed abroad. During his speech at the meeting, Molotov pointed out that this resolution is only a preliminary step towards universal disarmament, and its implementation depends on the efforts of peace-loving countries. British representative Shawcross said that the realization of the disarmament plan urgently requires the spirit of mutual trust among the major powers in the conference. When reviewing the disarmament issue, U.S. representative Connally stated that the most important principle for maintaining world peace is the unity of the major powers.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 15th: New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution at midnight on the 12th by a large majority (40 votes in favor, 6 votes against, and 13 abstentions), instructing all member states to recall their ambassadors or ministers to Spain, and recommending that the Security Council consider what measures should be taken if the Franco regime is not replaced by a democratic government within a considerable period of time. The resolution also prohibits Franco's Spain from participating in all United Nations agencies. Currently, among the 54 member states of the United Nations, 15 have ambassadors or ministers stationed in Spain. British officials announced on the 13th that they would recall their ambassador to Spain, and Dutch officials also expressed this intention.
