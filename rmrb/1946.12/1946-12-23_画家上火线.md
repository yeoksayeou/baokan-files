Painters on the Front Line

    The charge began. Li Shanyuan, the squad leader of the third company, with a rifle slung across his back and his head shaved, led the assault group bravely forward, his right hand tightly gripping a hand grenade.
    Inside another gun emplacement, two people were rapidly sketching this tense scene into their sketchbooks. They were our painters, comrades Zou Ya and Guan Fusheng.
    As the troops advanced into the village, they followed, capturing the disheveled appearance of the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, the smiling faces of our soldiers leading mules and horses and carrying confiscated guns, and even the scene of a Chiang soldier and a yellow dog lying dead together on the village, all recorded in their sketchbooks.
    As soon as the battle ended, our painters were constantly wielding their brushes in front of He Guansan, the commander of the Chiang puppet Twelfth Corps, and among the heroes who fought bravely for the people.
    The soldiers developed a high degree of interest in these two hard-working people. Whenever their shadows appeared, a burst of joyful commotion would erupt in the crowd: "The painters are here, the painters are here!" Some soldiers vowed, "Damn it, I'll have them paint me next time, too."

　　画家上火线
    夏川
    冲锋开始了，三连班长李善元，大背枪、光着头，右手紧握手榴弹，带领突击组一勇而上。
    在另一个工事的枪眼里边，有两个人迅速把这一紧张的场面描上画簿，那便是我们的画家邹雅和关夫生同志。
    部队突进寨里，他们也跟到寨里，把蒋军俘虏们狼狈模样画上，把我们战士们牵着骡马、缴了枪炮笑态可掬的容貌画上，把倒在寨上的一个蒋军和一只黄狗倒毙在一起的情景，也曾收在画簿里了。
    战斗一结束，在蒋伪十二总队长何冠三跟前，在为人民英勇奋斗的英雄群里，我们的画家在不停的挥动着画笔。
    对这两个紧张工作的人，战士们发生了高度的兴趣，每当他们的影子出现的时候，人群里便引起一阵喜悦的骚动：“画画的来了，画画的来了！”有的战士发誓似的说：“奶奶，看下回也得让他们给画一个才是。”
