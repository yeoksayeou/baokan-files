Greatly Smashed the Yellow Village Tortoise Shell
    Shen Rong
    General Liu Bocheng allowed us to visit the battlefield and allocated us a small jeep, which was captured in the Juye Campaign twenty days ago. We arrived at Yellow Village on the afternoon of November 22nd. Thirteen hours before, fierce fighting was still taking place here.
    After the Chiang troops occupied Yellow Village, they built it into a small circular castle, with a circumference of more than four li. The outermost circle was a chevaux de frise, slightly inside was a deep ditch, then a circle of wooden stakes, a circle of trenches, and the innermost layer was a city wall of seventeen or eight chi high. The city wall had bunkers, and under the bunkers were trenches, making it a typical "tortoise shell." When we arrived, there were still piles of unextinguished smoke outside the fortifications. The Chiang troops, fearing night attacks by the Eighth Route Army, burned dry grass and branches brightly every night. In my opinion, it was difficult not only to break through the dense fire net, but even to climb in step by step. However, the soldiers of the Eighth Route Army said, "We solved the battle in an hour and a half!" They only spent thirty minutes rushing onto the city wall and then annihilated a regimental headquarters and two battalion headquarters of the Chiang troops.
    We walked into the village from the breached chevaux de frise, ditch, and city wall opening. The battlefield had already been cleaned up, but traces of blood could still be found on the ground. The houses near the city wall were either collapsed or damaged, and those that were spared were riddled with bullet holes. The villagers were moving broken wood. Piles of American-style wide-brimmed military hats worn by Chiang soldiers were everywhere on the mounds.
    The sound of machine guns and artillery fire was intermittent. I thought there was still fighting going on somewhere, but the commanders smiled and said that the soldiers were test-firing their guns. The soldiers were very happy to have captured guns and artillery, and they always wanted to play with them, and even orders couldn't stop them.
    Soldiers were sleeping in front of the bunkers and in the sun. Some soldiers were walking around leisurely, like students on vacation. At the end of a small alley, a soldier was playing the huqin. A certain brigade commander traveling with us grabbed him and said, "Lend it to me, lend it to me!" The soldier jumped, shouted, and laughed as he ran away, making us all laugh. People told me that he was captured in the Dingtao Campaign two months ago. Suddenly, I found him following us again. I asked him, "What is the difference between the Kuomintang army and the Eighth Route Army?" "They are class oppressors," he said. Eight years ago, he was conscripted into the Kuomintang army and assigned to the Third Division. He had been an acting deputy platoon leader. Now he is a gunner in the Eighth Route Army. "How is it to be in the Eighth Route Army?" I asked him again. "It's fun and interesting here!" he said. He liked to talk. He said that in the Kuomintang army, it was a matter of fate whether you were killed or not. Here, you fight for the people. It is an honor to die. In the Kuomintang army, twenty liang of grain are allocated every day, regardless of whether it is enough for you to eat or not. In the Eighth Route Army, you eat as much as you can, until you are full. Finally, he laughed comically and said, "The Eighth Route Army is for the poor to turn over, and the Kuomintang army is selling its life to Chiang Kai-shek, serving the American daddy." I asked him what his name was. He said it several times, but I still didn't understand. Suddenly, he remembered something and took out a small notebook from his pocket, flipped through it, and found a page. It turned out that these words were written on it: "Hou Chaozhi, Langzhong County, Sichuan Province, ×× Ji, Hou Chaoju." Hou Chaozhi was him, and Hou Chaoju was his cousin. He said that he had made up his mind that if he sacrificed this time, please ask the troops to write a letter to notify his family. These liberated soldiers are very brave in combat. Many of those captured in the Ping-Han Campaign last year have already become squad leaders and deputy platoon leaders.
    Walking out of the village, there were some family letters from the Chiang soldiers scattered by the roadside. I picked up one at random. It was written by an old mother to her son, Liu Qiwen. In addition to her thoughts and feelings, the letter also told him about the Latin grain levy and finally hoped that he would ask for leave to go back and get married. "White-haired mother awaits her son's return, a young woman keeps the empty room." This Liu Qiwen may have been wronged and sent to his death for Chiang Kai-shek, never to return?!

　　大破黄庄乌龟壳
    沈容
    刘伯承将军允许我们去参观战场，并且拨给一辆小吉普车，那是二十天前在鄄城战役中缴获的。我们于十一月二十二日下午到达黄庄，十三个钟头以前，这里还在进行剧烈的战斗。
    黄庄是一个小村子，蒋军占领以后，就把它筑成一个圆形的小城堡，周围约有四里多地，最外一圈是鹿砦，稍里是一圈深深的水沟，然后又是一圈木桩，一圈壕沟，最内层才是一丈七八尺高的城墙。城墙上有堡垒，堡垒底下又有战壕，是一个典型的“乌龟壳”。我们到时，工事外面还有一堆一堆的火烟没有熄灭，蒋军害怕八路军夜袭，每天晚上用干草树枝烧得通亮。在我看来，不说是从严密的火网下打进去，就是一步一步爬进去，都很困难，但是八路军的战士说：“我们一个半钟头就解决了战斗！”他们只费了三十分钟，就冲上城，然后把蒋军一个团部、两个营部歼灭了。
    我们从突破的鹿砦、水沟、城墙口上走进村去，战场已经打扫过了，只是地下还能发现斑斑的血迹。近城墙的房子，倒的倒了，垮的垮了，能够幸免的也被子弹穿了很多洞。老乡们正在搬运碎木材。土堆上到处是蒋军士兵载的美式宽边军帽。
    机枪声，大炮声时断时续，我以为还有什么地方正在打，指挥员们微笑着说，这是战士们试枪，战士缴获了枪炮，高兴得很，总要打着玩玩，下命令也禁止不了。
    地堡前和太阳底下，都有战士在睡觉，有的战士悠闲地走来走去，好像学生们放了假一样。一条小巷顶头，一个战士正在拉胡琴，和我们同行的某旅长一把拉住他说：“借给我，借给我！”那战士跳着嚷着笑着跑掉了，引得我们都大笑起来。人们告诉我说，他是两月前定曹战役中俘虏过来的，忽然我发现他又跟在我们后面，我问他：“国民党军和八路军有什么不同？”“他们是阶级压破。”他说，八年前他被国民党抓了丁，编在第三师，曾经当过代理副排长，现在来八路军当炮手。“当八路军怎么样呢？”我又追问他。“这里痛快有意思！”他说。他很喜欢讲话，他说在国民党军队里是打死了该死，打不死命长，这里是为老百姓打仗，打死了他光荣。国民党军队里每天规定二十两粮，不管你够吃不够吃。八路军里是尽吃，吃饱算数。最后他又滑稽的笑着说：“八路军是为穷人翻身，国民党军队是给蒋介石卖命，给美国爸爸效劳”。我问他叫什么名字，他说了几遍我还没有听懂，忽然他想起了什么，从口袋里掏出一个小本子，翻来翻去找出一页来，原来上面写着这几个字：“侯朝芝四川阆中县××集侯朝举”。侯朝芝就是他，侯朝举是他的堂兄。他说他下了决心，如果这次牺牲了，请部队写封信通知他家里的人们。这些解放过来的战士，在作战中都非常英勇，去年平汉战役俘虏过来的，有很多已当了班长和副排长了。
    走出村子，路旁散着些蒋军的家书，随手拾起一封，是一个老母亲写给他的儿子刘启文的，信里除了想念之情，还告诉他不少拉丁征粮的事，最后希望他请假回去结婚。“白发娘望儿归，红妆守空帏。”这位刘启文也许已经冤枉替蒋介石送了命，永远不会回去了？！
