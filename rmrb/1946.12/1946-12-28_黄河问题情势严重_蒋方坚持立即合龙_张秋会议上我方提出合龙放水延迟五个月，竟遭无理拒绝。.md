　　[Report from our newspaper in the JiluYu area on the 25th] Mr. Todd, the American advisor to the Yellow River Committee in Kaifeng, Qi Shou'an, the Deputy Director of the Nationalist Blocking and Restoration Bureau, Yan Zhenxing, the Director of the Engineering Department, and Hansen, the UNRRA representative stationed in Western Shandong, and others, a group of more than ten people, arrived in Zhangqiu Town on the 18th. That evening, they held a discussion with the members of our Yellow River Committee and Directors Duan and Jia of the Administrative Office on the Yellow River issue. Representative Zhao (Mingfu) of our Yellow River Committee put forward his opinions, stating roughly: "The Nationalist Party does not abide by the agreement and unilaterally blocks the breach, so that the breach-blocking project can be completed by the end of the year, while the dike restoration project will still take a long time. The Ministry of National Defense has repeatedly telegraphed urging the blocking of the breach, without mentioning the restoration of the dikes. It is clear that the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek have made the Yellow River a component of their political and military conspiracy. The situation is very serious. We hope everyone will put forward their opinions in the spirit of serving the people." At the beginning of the speech, he talked about the situation of blocking the breach and negotiating the dike restoration methods. Director Wang Huayun of our Yellow River Committee immediately put forward the reasons for postponing the breach blocking, stating roughly: "The Nationalist Party has violated the agreement, not providing labor and materials, and has carried out large-scale military destruction, robbing our materials and equipment for repairing and blocking breaches, and shooting at our dike restoration workers, resulting in the delay of the dike restoration project. Now, it is freezing cold and it is impossible to work." Finally, he put forward: (1) The work of consolidating dangerous works, straightening bends, and relocating residents must be resolved immediately. The 4.9 billion owed for the first phase of dike restoration must be paid off by the end of the year. According to the Shanghai agreement, two-thirds of the labor food and funds should be paid on January 5th, and the full amount should be paid by the end of January. (2) In the future, funds, food, and relief materials should be directly allocated by the UNRRA, without going through the UNRRA organs monopolized by the Nationalist Party. (3) Our dike construction has been delayed by the Nationalist Party for five months, and it should be postponed for another five months, until June of next year, before blocking the breach and releasing water. All the members unanimously agreed that this was a reasonable request. Mr. Todd also said: "I personally agree to postpone the breach-blocking time, because I understand this situation best. I am willing to do all the work well before releasing water, so I advocate restoring the dikes to the state of 1931. However, I cannot guarantee that the Nationalist Party will not continue to block the breach and release water, but I am willing to submit this issue to General Marshall for handling." Yan Zhenxing stated: "The Executive Yuan has allocated 140 billion in relief funds to water conservancy, and the Water Conservancy Commission has approved 66 billion for the Yellow River breach blocking and restoration. The principle of dike restoration is to restore to the state of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937). The work of consolidating dangerous works and straightening bends is not within the scope of dike restoration. Next year's budget is based on this." The members of our Yellow River Committee unanimously opposed, saying: (1) The dike restoration funds are too far from the actual needs; (2) It is unreasonable to only focus on money and not on the size of the project; (3) Consolidating dangerous works, straightening bends, and dredging the estuary were originally stipulated in the engineering draft signed by both parties in the Nanjing agreement. Now, postponing it to next year is obviously another military and political conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek. Regarding the allocation of funds and the boundary of dike construction, the conference agreed that the regulations before the Heze Agreement should remain unchanged, and should not be changed due to military influence. The 66 billion dike restoration funds should be rationally allocated based on the length of the dike line and the size of the project. However, the Nationalist Party representatives refused to sign any agreement and firmly refused to agree to this lowest reasonable request. The meeting argued all night without any result. Finally, our side stated: "The meeting has progressed to this point, and the dike restoration issue cannot be resolved. It is the Nationalist Party's determination not to resolve the issue and to completely reject our reasonable demands. We hereby solemnly declare that the Nationalist Party will be fully responsible for any events that occur in the future as a result of this." The meeting ended without results.

　　黄河问题情势严重
    蒋方坚持立即合龙
    张秋会议上我方提出合龙放水延迟五个月，竟遭无理拒绝。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】开封黄委会美籍顾问塔德、国民党堵复局副局长齐寿安、工程处长阎振兴及联总驻鲁西代表韩森等一行十余人，于十八日抵张秋镇。当晚与我黄委会各委员及行署段、贾主任座谈黄河问题，并由我黄委会赵代表（明甫）提出意见，略谓：“国民党不遵守协议，片面堵口，以至堵口工程年底可完成，而复堤工程则需时尚多，国防部几次电催堵口，不谈复堤，显系美帝国主义者与蒋介石已把黄河作为政治军事阴谋的组成部分，情势非常严重，希望大家本为人民的精神提出意见。”发言开始，即谈堵口情形、交涉复堤办法，我黄委会王主任化云即提出推迟堵口的理由，略谓：“国民党破坏协议，不给工料工款，而又大举军事破坏，抢劫我修堵器材物资，扫射我复堤工员，以致复堤工程延期。至今，天寒地冻，无法工作。”最后并提出：（一）整理险工、裁湾取直与居民迁移等工作要马上求得解决，第一期复堤欠款四十九亿，要于年底付清。工粮工款本上海协议于一月五日付三分之二，一月底付清。（二）今后款粮与救济物资均由联总直接拨付，不必再经国民党一党包办的行总机关。（三）我方堤工被国民党耽搁五个月，应再推迟五个月，至明年六月再行堵口放水。各委员一致认为这是合理的要求。塔德先生亦表示：“推迟堵口时间，我个人是同意的，因为我最了解这种情况，我就愿意把一切工作作好再放水，所以我主张把堤复到一九三一年的状况，但是我不敢保证国民党不继续堵口放水，不过我愿把这问题提交马歇尔将军处理。”阎振兴提出：“行政院分配救济基金，水利占一千四百亿，水利委员会批准黄河堵复费六百六十亿，复堤以民国二十六年状况为原则，险工与取直等工作不在复堤之内，明年预算乃系按此提出。”我黄委会各委员一致反对谓：（１）复堤款离实际需要太远；（２）只以钱为主不以工程大小为标准，太不合理；（３）整理险工、裁湾取直与疏浚海口，本为南京协议双方签订之工程草案所规定，今推至明年，显然又是蒋介石的军事政治阴谋。关于分配款项与堤工的界限，大会上均同意以荷泽协议前之规定原封不变，不受军事影响而变动，大致以堤线之长短及工程大小，将六百六十亿复堤款合理分配。但国民党代表不肯签订任何协议，对此最低的合理要求，坚不答应，会议争论彻夜，毫无结果。最后，我方表示：“会议进行至此，复堤问题不能解决，是国方决意不解决问题，而完全拒绝我合理要求。在此特郑重声明，今后因此而发生任何事件，概由国方完全负责。”会议遂无结果而散。
