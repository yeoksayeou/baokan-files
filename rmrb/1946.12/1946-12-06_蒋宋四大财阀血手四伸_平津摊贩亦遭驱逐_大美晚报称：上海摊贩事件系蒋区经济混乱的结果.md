　　Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen Four Major Financial Groups Extend Bloody Hands
  　Tianjin and Beijing Street Vendors Also Expelled
  　American Evening Post Claims: Shanghai Street Vendor Incident Is a Result of Economic Chaos in Chiang-Controlled Areas
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd] Simultaneously with the Chiang government’s expulsion, arrest, and massacre of street vendors in Shanghai, it also announced the expulsion of street vendors in Beijing and Tianjin. According to an Associated Press report: Chiang Kai-shek’s military police in Beijing issued an order on the evening of the 1st, prohibiting all street vendors from setting up stalls on the streets, and announced a city-wide curfew, forcing all shops and entertainment venues to close before 10:30 PM. The Tianjin Chiang regime municipal authorities also issued an order on the 2nd to expel street vendors from the main roads. Tianjin street vendors formed a group to petition the municipal government, requesting a postponement of the implementation, but were rejected.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd] According to various reports, the Shanghai street vendor unrest, resisting the Kuomintang authorities' arrests and killings, has temporarily subsided on the surface due to the authorities' bloody suppression. It is said that traffic in Shanghai has been restored, and some businesses in certain areas have been forcibly reopened by the authorities, but the entire city remains under curfew. Fully armed police officers patrol the streets. During the city-wide crackdown the other day, the municipal government ordered the police to "kill without mercy" any resisting crowds. On that day, in addition to killing more than ten street vendors and wounding over a hundred, the Chiang government also arrested more than twenty street vendors. It is believed that many more street vendors were secretly murdered by the police. The Shanghai-based American Evening Post, run by American expatriates, commented: "This unrest is the result of Shanghai's chaotic economic situation and the widespread dissatisfaction with labor conditions. Shanghai's economy is in a precarious state, which may lead to even greater conflicts in the city. The government should bear the primary responsibility for this incident." According to a United Press report: Street talk in Shanghai believes that the street vendors' resistance is an "event where the government forces the people to fight for survival." Most observers in Shanghai point out that Shanghai's economic situation is deteriorating rapidly, and many shops and factories will not be able to survive the Lunar New Year. It is expected that disturbances will occur again in the Shanghai market, even on a larger and more serious scale. Popular discontent with the government has "ripened and is on the verge of erupting."

　　蒋宋四大财阀血手四伸
  　平津摊贩亦遭驱逐
  　大美晚报称：上海摊贩事件系蒋区经济混乱的结果
    【新华社延安三日电】蒋政府与在上海驱逐逮捕并屠杀摊贩同时，在北平天津亦宣布驱逐摊贩。据美联社讯：北平蒋介石宪兵于一日晚下令，市上一切摊贩不准在街上摆摊，并宣布全市戒严，所有商店及娱乐场所均被迫令于晚上十点半以前即行关门。天津蒋记市政当局亦于二日下令驱逐各主要马路上之摊贩，天津摊贩曾结队向市政府请愿，要求缓期实行，但遭拒绝。
    【新华社延安三日电】据各方报导：反抗国民党当局逮捕及屠杀的上海摊贩骚动，是自己因当局的流血镇压，表面上暂告沉寂。据说沪市交通已行恢复，若干地区的商品已被当局强迫重新开业，惟全市仍直告戒严。全副武装之，在街警察们来往巡逻。市政府于前日全市驱动中，下令警察对反抗的群众“格杀勿论”。该日蒋政府除杀死摊贩十余人、击伤百余人外，并逮捕二十余名摊贩，众信还有许多摊贩业被警察暗杀。旁观的上海美侨所办的大美晚报评论称：“此次骚动乃上海经济的混乱状态及劳工状况普遍的不能令人满意的结果。上海经济处于千钧一发之中，可能造成全市的更大冲突，此次事件应由政府负主要责任。”又据合众社讯：上海街谈巷议均认为摊贩的反抗，乃为政府“迫使人民为生存而斗争的事件，上海大多数观察家指出，上海经济情况正节节恶化，许多商店工厂不能渡过旧历年关。预料上海市场将再度发生骚乱，甚至规模更大更严重之骚乱，人民对政府的不满，已“酝酿成熟，有一触即发之虞”。
