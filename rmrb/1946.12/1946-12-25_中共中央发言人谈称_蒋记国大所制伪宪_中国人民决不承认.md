Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 21st: (Delayed) "The 'National Assembly' convened by Chiang Kai-shek is illegal, and therefore any so-called 'constitution' passed by this 'National Assembly' is a false constitution, which the Chinese people will never recognize." This was the main point of a statement made today by the spokesperson of the CCP Central Committee to our agency's reporter.

The CCP Central Committee spokesperson stated: "Dictator Chiang Kai-shek, along with his lackeys from the Youth Party and a section of the Democratic Socialist Party, and his American supporters, are now putting on an act, pretending to be 'democratic', and are even 'criticizing troublemakers' and 'suppressing stubborn elements' so that the so-called 'National Assembly' can pass a 'democratic constitution'. However, anyone who remembers two things will know that this tactic is not new. Chiang Kai-shek 'reprimanded' so-called troublemakers at the Nationalists' military reorganization meeting in February and the Second Plenary Session of the Nationalist Party's Central Committee in March, but the person directing these troublemakers behind the scenes was none other than Chiang Kai-shek himself. Chiang Kai-shek is the ringleader and instigator of these troublemakers. Chiang Kai-shek's American supporters have also 'criticized' so-called stubborn elements, but the person helping these stubborn elements to tear up the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolutions and the ceasefire order was none other than this American critic himself. In these farcical 'National Assembly' shows, Chiang Kai-shek deliberately incites his loyal party members to demand more open dictatorship, and then opposes it in a pre-arranged manner, in order to show that he, the 'National Assembly' representatives of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, and the American wire-pullers are more 'democratic' and more 'compliant with the PCC principles'. However, this double act cannot deceive the Chinese people."

When the reporter inquired about the so-called PCC draft constitution, the spokesperson said: "The PCC only passed the principles for revising the draft constitution, and the work of revising the draft constitution did not even reach an agreement in the PCC draft constitution review committee due to the sabotage and procrastination of the Kuomintang. The committee stopped working after April and there was no so-called PCC draft constitution at all." The spokesperson also said: "Chiang Kai-shek was so overwhelmed by the capture of Zhangjiakou that he dared to go down a dead end politically, convened an illegal 'National Assembly', and completely overturned the PCC line. Now that Chiang Kai-shek is visibly on the decline, he and his American supporters seem to understand that they have made a mistake. If they really want to repent, there is no need to make a fuss about any 'constitution'. They should simply dissolve this illegal 'National Assembly' and restore the military positions of January 13th in order to continue peace talks, and then there will be a question of a constitution. If they don't do this, and instead learn from Yuan Shikai, on the one hand, launching a large-scale civil war and pushing the constitutional 'National Assembly' to the end; and on the other hand, passing some kind of 'democratic constitution', this will only further isolate themselves from the people. The 'democratic constitution' that Chiang's 'National Assembly' is about to pass is, even in its wording, inferior to Yuan Shikai's Temple of Heaven Constitution, let alone the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang. However, under the fascist rule of Chiang Kai-shek, even if there were a good document like the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, it would still be of no practical use, and there would still be no democracy. If the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique is not abolished, no matter how the constitution is worded, the people will never get democracy. This is already common sense for the Chinese people."

### 中共中央发言人谈称  蒋记国大所制伪宪  中国人民决不承认

　　中共中央发言人谈称
    蒋记国大所制伪宪
    中国人民决不承认
    【新华社延安二十一日电】（迟到）“蒋介石所召开的所谓‘国大’是非法的，因此这个‘国大’所通过的任何所谓‘宪法’是伪宪，中国人民决不承认”。这是中共中央发言人今日对本社记者谈话的要点。
    中共中央发言人称：“独裁者蒋介石及其青年党与一部分民社党的仆从和他的美国支持者们，现在装模作样，似乎他们是要‘民主’的，还在‘批评捣乱分子’和‘压制顽固分子’以便所谓‘国大’能通过一部‘民主宪法’。但是，谁只要记得两件事，就知道这一手法并不新奇，蒋介石曾在二月的国民党整军会议和三月的国民党二中全会上‘申斥’过所谓捣乱分子，可是在背后指使这些捣乱分子的人不是别人，正是蒋介石自己。蒋介石乃是这些捣乱分子的总头目和教唆狗。蒋介石的美国支持者，也曾‘批评’过所谓顽固分子，可是帮助这些顽固分子撕毁政协决议与停战令的不是别人，也就是这位美国批评家自己。在这些所谓‘国大’的滑稽戏中，蒋介石故意唆使他的忠实党羽要求更公开的独裁，然后加以预定的反对，以便表示他和青年党、民社党的‘国大’代表以及美国牵线人是较为‘民主’，较为‘遵守政协原则’的。但是，这一套双簧骗不了中国的人民”。
    当记者询以有无所谓政协宪草事，发言人说：“政协仅仅通过了宪草修改原则，其修改宪草的工作因国民党之破坏与怠工，甚至在政协宪草审议委员会中都未获协议。该委员会四月以后，即告停止工作，根本无所谓政协宪草”。发言人又说：“蒋介石因为攻占张家口冲昏了头脑，胆敢在政治上走绝路，召开非法‘国大’，彻底推翻政协路线。现在蒋介石眼看就走下坡路了，他和他的美国支持者似乎是懂得自己已犯了错误，如果他们真正还想改悔，是无庸在什么‘宪法’上做文章的，应该干脆解散这个非法‘国大’，和恢复一月十三日的军事位置，以便继续和平谈判，然后才有宪法问题之可言。不此之图，还要学袁世凯，一面大打内战，和把宪法‘国大’开到底；一面又通过什么‘民主宪法’，这只是更加自绝于人民。现在蒋记‘国大’所要通过的‘民主宪法’，就字面说甚至还不及袁世凯的天坛宪法，更不及国民党第一次代表大会宣言。然而，在蒋介石的法西斯统治下，就算有了国民党第一次代表大会宣言这样的好文件，都依然无补于实际，依然毫无民主可言。蒋介石反动集团的独裁不取消，不论宪法字面上怎样，人民总之休想得到民主，这已是中国人民的常识”。
