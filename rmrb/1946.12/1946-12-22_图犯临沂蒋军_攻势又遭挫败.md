Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th: Chiang Kai-shek's troops invading Southern Shandong continue to suffer setbacks. The Nationalist troops of the 26th Division and the rapid forces of the 80th Brigade of the 28th Division, dispatched from Yixian County and moving eastward via Xiangcheng and Bianzhuang (70 miles southwest of Linyi), and the 169th Brigade of the 77th Division, advancing towards Lufang (15 miles east of Lanling), were all met with head-on blows from the New Fourth Army. On the 17th, four Nationalist tanks were destroyed in Daicun (south of Bianzhuang), and more than 40 prisoners were taken. At the same time, the 108th Brigade of the 59th Division, advancing eastward from Taierzhuang via Chahe (30 miles east of Taierzhuang), was also repelled. A small boat carrying more than ten Nationalist soldiers belonging to a unit of the 38th Brigade, advancing along the Grand Canal to Tanshang (25 miles south of Pixian), was also sunk. The Nationalist troops who occupied Da and Xiao Liangcheng retreated after more than 80 were killed or wounded. On the 16th, the Nationalist troops again attacked Da Liangcheng, and after the Eighth Route Army killed more than 300 of them, they voluntarily withdrew from the town. On the 17th, the Eighth Route Army defeated the Nationalist troops in Chuzhuang, Suozhuang and other places northeast of Chahe. Fierce fighting is still continuing on the front line.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 18th: A certain unit of the Eighth Route Army on the east side of the Jinpu Railway launched a self-defense counterattack on the 13th, destroying the Nationalist-held Xinhai County government, capturing the habitual bandit Yuan Huanjun and squadron leader Wang Muke, and more than 170 others. Qijiawushang Town, where the county's village was located, was liberated. (Note: Xinhai County is near the Bohai Sea, within Hebei Province, east of Cangzhou.)
