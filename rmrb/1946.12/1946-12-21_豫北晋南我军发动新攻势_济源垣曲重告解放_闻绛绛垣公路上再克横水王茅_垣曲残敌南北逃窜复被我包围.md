[Taiyue Dispatch, 18th] The Eighth Route Army on the southern front of Taiyue simultaneously liberated Jiyuan and Yuanqu counties again on the 14th. To strike at the Chiang army's expanded offensive against our liberated areas under the guise of the "ceasefire order," the Taiyue southern front troops launched offensives in western northern Henan and the Jiang (County)-Yuan (Qu) area of southern Shanxi from the end of last month to the beginning of this month. On the 29th of last month, Jiyuan City was recovered. On the 4th of this month, Yuanqu County and important strongholds such as the Jiang (County)-Yuan (Qu) Highway and Wangmao Town were recovered, seriously threatening the rear of the Chiang army. The warmonger Hu Zongnan was thrown into a panic and had to adopt the method of robbing Peter to pay Paul, transferring the 31st Brigade defending the Wen (Xi)-Xia (County) area and part of the 67th Brigade of the 30th Division in the Yicheng area, and ordering the remnants of the Chiang army that had fled to the Zhongwang Village area southeast of Jiyuan to forcibly seize our recovered areas. Under the guidance of the principle of "cities still belong to us after effectively annihilating the enemy's strength," our army withdrew from Jiyuan City on the 3rd and Yuanqu City on the 11th, and intensified the encirclement of the advancing Chiang army in coordination with the militia guerrillas, and advanced to the deep rear of the Chiang army in Wen (Xi) and Xia (County). On the 8th, the towns of Hengshui and Podi on the Wen (Xi)-Jiang (County) Highway were captured, eight bunkers were burned, and more than a thousand kilograms of electric wire were seized. At the same time, the Xia County guerrilla corps actively operated along the Wenxi-Shuitou line, destroying seven Chiang army bunkers on Emei Ridge southeast of Guodian in the Wen (Xi)-Xia (County) area. The Chiang army was overwhelmed and its embarrassment was fully exposed. We took advantage of the victory to launch a new offensive on the front and both flanks, starting with the attack on Jiyuan City on the evening of the 8th, and simultaneously captured Jiyuan and Yuanqu counties on the 14th. On the 15th, we continued to recover the outer strongholds of the Chiang army, such as Zhongwang Village (southeast of Jiyuan) and Wangmao Town (northwest of Yuanqu). The remnants of the Chiang army that fled to the south bank of the Yellow River in Jiyuan and Henglingguan (at the junction of Jiang and Yuanqu) were again trapped in our new encirclement. There are now no enemy troops south of Henglingguan. According to incomplete statistics, in this battle to recover Jiyuan City, more than 300 Chiang army security regiment commander Yang Ruixiang and others were captured alive, more than 40 were killed or wounded, and six machine guns and more than 40 rifles were seized.

　　豫北晋南我军发动新攻势
    济源垣曲重告解放
    闻绛绛垣公路上再克横水王茅
    垣曲残敌南北逃窜复被我包围
    【本报太岳十八日电】太岳南线八路军，十四日同时再度光复济源、垣曲两县城。为打击蒋军在“停战令”掩饰下，扩大对我解放区的进攻，太岳南线部队自上月底至本月初，先后在豫北西部及晋南绛（县）垣（曲）地区发动攻势，上月二十九日收复济源城，本月四日收复垣曲县城，及绛（县）垣（曲）公路、王茅镇等重要据点，严重威胁蒋军后方。好战分子胡宗南手忙脚乱，不得不采取拆西墙补东墙的办法，抽调防守闻（喜）夏（县）地区之三十一旅及翼城地区之三十师六十七旅一部，并令窜至济源东南中王村一带之蒋军残部，强夺我光复地区；我军在“有效的歼灭敌人有生力量后城市仍归我所有”的方针指导下，三日撤出济源城，十一日撤出垣曲城，配合民兵游击队加紧对进占蒋军的围困，并挺进闻（喜）夏（县）蒋军深后方，八日攻克闻（喜）绛（县）公路上之横水、坡底两镇，烧毁碉堡八座，收割电线千余斤。同时夏县游击兵团积极在闻喜、水头一线活动，摧毁闻（喜）夏（县）地区郭店东南峨嵋岭蒋军碉堡七座，蒋军顾此失彼，窘态毕露。我乃乘胜于正面左右两冀开展新攻势，以八日晚袭入济源城为起点，十四日同时攻克济源、垣曲两县城。十五日继续收复中王村（济源东南）、王茅镇（垣曲西北）等蒋军外围据点，逃窜至济源南黄河边及横岭关（绛、垣交界处）之蒋军残部，又陷于我新的包围卷内。现在横岭关以南，已无敌军。据不完全统计，此次光复济源城之役，生擒蒋军保安团长杨瑞祥以下三百余人，毙伤四十余人，缴获机枪六挺、步枪四十余支。（附图片）
