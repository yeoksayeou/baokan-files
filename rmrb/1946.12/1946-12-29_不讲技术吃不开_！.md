"You Can't Get By Without Knowing Technique!"
    Nǎi Yī
    While conducting interviews in the front-line troops of the Jǐ Lǔ Yù Military Region, I was astonished by the fervent fighting spirit and the battle emotions full of confidence in victory throughout the army. I asked Sun, the company commander of the Fifth Company of a certain unit, about this matter, wondering what method they used to achieve such amazing success.

    The reason is very simple. Company Commander Sun told me: "It's all about improving our techniques. The troops become tougher the more they fight, and each time we can guarantee victory with fewer casualties and more spoils of war. By seizing the gaps in the war to intensify training, the troops will flourish, and their fighting spirit will definitely be at its peak."

    Company Commander Sun also told me the history of his company. He said: The Fifth Company was originally upgraded from a cadre detachment. When we first participated in the Lanfeng counter-offensive, our task was to eliminate the enemy in the Nanguan Garden, but we didn't fight well. The soldiers were not familiar with the techniques and crowded into a courtyard. When the enemy's grenades came, the soldiers forgot that they also had grenades, resulting in some unnecessary casualties. Liu Fahuai climbed onto the roof, but did not know how to suppress the enemy's fire, and an engineer was also shot down. We suffered some from grenades and even let a small number of the enemy escape. In the Wangjiazhai battle, we also took some shelling.

    We didn't seize many weapons in several battles, but we did get one thing: "You can't get by without knowing technique."

    In late October, the troops decided to conduct training. Company Commander Sun laughed at himself, saying: "In the past, I used to get a headache whenever I heard about training. I thought, 'What's the point of training? Fighting means people die!'" I myself had a careless bad habit and didn't like to use my brain much. Once something came to me, I would forget it in three to five minutes. Once, I told the soldiers a few things, but in less than five minutes, I forgot the rest. The soldiers asked me, but I couldn't remember. I slapped myself twice. When Regiment Chief of Staff ×× comrade came, I offered to quit."

    Soon after, a review meeting was held to review our work. First, the command was inadequate and inflexible. Second, the soldiers' combat skills were low, and they didn't know how to build fortifications. The conclusion was: To win battles, you must know the techniques.

    The morale of the whole company was high, even more intense than in battle. No one lay in the houses anymore, and at night, the whole squad was often found sneaking out for exercises. Once, the whole company didn't sleep for two nights, collectively practicing night attacks and dawn street fighting. The soldiers used torches to create targets for grenade throwing, and they placed beans on the muzzles of their guns to aim and fire. If the beans fell off, it proved that their marksmanship was not good. The regiment had ordered them not to get up early, but there was no way to stop their enthusiasm.

    One day, the regiment called a meeting, but the troops were nowhere to be found. The messenger ran five miles to find them. It turned out they had built more than four hundred fortifications in the field. They reduced the time it took to build a fortification from twenty-six minutes to two minutes and forty seconds, shortening the time by twenty-three minutes.

    In the evening, we practiced attacking. The soldiers broke through the stockade and outer moat from the southeast corner and entered the enclosed village. When the enemy discovered them, several flares were fired, and the soldiers rushed forward courageously. Li Mingshan, the third platoon deputy, encountered the enemy and grappled with them. The enemy retreated into the street, and a wall blocked the way. He shouted, "Digging a hole is too slow, get more people!" A group of people knocked down the earthen wall and rushed in. The next day, the landlord came, and we spent the whole day repairing the wall. This was the first time we practiced night attacks, with the Sixth Company defending and us attacking. Twenty days later, the Third Squad wrote a letter to the regiment, asking the leaders to give them the task of leading the attack.

    On November 19th, the request was answered. We accepted the task of leading the attack on Shangguan Village. Instructor Zhao Yutian told me the attack route, but I chose another place on the eastern side because it was closer and the terrain was easier to conceal. Light and heavy machine guns and small cannons were all positioned to completely block the large and small bunkers on the east and northeast corners. I transferred a light machine gun from the third platoon to the west of the attack direction and started firing first.

    All the enemy's firepower was activated, and the intensity of the battle was rare. But like in the exercises, we passed through the wooden stockade and entered the outer moat without the enemy noticing. The third squad threw grenades, the second squad erected ladders, and the eighth and ninth squads launched a surprise attack. Each squad executed the orders with great skill and speed. Unfortunately, the ladder broke, and the eighth and ninth squads built a human ladder to climb the wall and capture two bunkers. The third platoon immediately modified the enemy's fortifications on the wall and bunkers. The enemy's three counterattacks were repelled, and we completed the mission.

    In this battle, Ren Chengru was wounded in seven places but refused to leave the line of fire. Cao Dongfu and Zhang Xuwen were both selected as combat heroes, and all the soldiers of the company became even more tenacious. Moreover, our casualties were two-thirds less than in the Lanfeng battle. The troops kept winning battles, constantly seizing weapons and capturing prisoners. The more the soldiers fought, the more they wanted to fight. At the mention of fighting, they were full of energy. That's the reason for our success." Company Commander Sun said here, his face full of smiles, his mood excited and happy.

　　“不讲技术吃不开”！
    乃一
    我在冀鲁豫前线部队中进行采访工作，看到全军上下那种狂热的战斗精神和充满胜利信心的战斗情绪，使我异常惊异，我将这事情请教某部五连孙连长，究竟他们用什么方法获得了如此惊人的成功呢？
    道理是很简单的，孙连长对我说：“这就是提高了技术，部队越打越硬，每次都保证能打胜仗，伤亡小，缴获多；随时利用战争空隙，抓紧整训，部队就会蓬蓬勃勃，战斗情绪就一定最旺盛”。
    孙连长又告诉我他连的历史，他说：五连本来是基干队升级的，第一次参加兰封反击战时，我们的任务是解决南关花园的敌人，就没打好。战士们不熟悉技术，挤在一个院子里，敌人手榴弹打来，战士们忘记了自己也有手榴弹，作了些不必要的伤亡。刘发怀爬上了房顶，但不知道封锁敌人火力，一个工兵也被打倒了。我们吃了些手榴弹，还让一小部分敌人跑了。王家垓战斗，我们也挨了些炮弹。
    几次战斗没有缴到多少枪，但我们却得到了一个东西，就是：“不讲技术吃不开”。
    十月下旬，部队决定整训。孙连长嘲笑他自己说：过去我一听到整训就头痛，我想：“整什么训，打仗就是要死人么！”我自己有个吊儿郎当的坏习气，不大爱用脑筋，事情一到我这里，三五分钟就忘了。有一次我向战士们讲了几个问题，但讲了不到五分钟，就把后面的忘掉了，战士们问我，再也想不起来。自己打了自己两个耳瓜子，团参谋长××同志来了，我就向他提出不干了。
    不久开了一次检讨会，检讨了我们的工作。第一，指挥没办法，不灵活。第二，战士作战技术低，不会做工事。结论是：打胜仗要讲技术。
    全连的情绪高涨了，比战斗还紧张，没有人再躺在房子里，夜里常常发现全班战士偷偷出去操作。有一次，全连两夜没有睡觉，集体演习夜间攻击，拂晓巷战。战士们用火炬堆成目标投弹，把豆粒放在枪口上瞄准射击，如豆子震掉就证明枪法不好。团曾下令，不准早起，但怎样也阻止不了他们这股子热劲。
    一天，团里召集开会，但部队不见了，通讯员跑了五里地才找回来。原来他们在野外做了四百多工事，他们把做一个工事由二十六分钟减到二分四十秒，缩减了二十三分钟的时间。
    晚上，我们演习攻击，战士们从东南角突破鹿寨和外壕，进到围寨。对方发觉了，几个照明弹打过来，战士们勇猛的扑上去。三排副李明山和敌人遭遇了，互相扭成了一团，敌人退到街里，一垛墙堵在前面，他喊到：“挖洞太慢，多来几个人！”一班人把土墙撞倒，冲进去了。第二天房东找来，我们修了一天墙，这是第一次演习夜间攻击，六连守，我们攻。二十天后，三班给团部写了信，他们要求首长给他们主攻任务。
    十一月十九日答复了要求，我们接受了上官村的主攻任务，教导员赵玉田同志告诉了我攻击的道路，但我选择了偏东面的另一处地方，因为这里更近，并且地势容易隐蔽。轻重机枪小炮等火力都布置好了，他们可以把东面和东北角的大小碉堡完全封锁。我另调三排的一挺轻机枪到攻击方向的西面，首先开始射击。
    敌人的一切火力都开动了，战斗的猛烈程度是少见的。但和演习一样，我们通过木寨，进到外壕，敌人并没发觉，三班投弹，二班竖梯子，八、九两班突击，各班执行了命令，配合非常熟练迅速。不巧梯子断了，八、九班搭了人梯爬上围墙夺下了两个碉堡，第三排在围墙和碉堡上马上改造了敌人的工事。敌人的三次反扑被打回去，我们完成了任务。
    这次战斗，任成如七处负伤，不下火线。曹东福、张续文都被选为战斗英雄，全连战士都更加顽强了。而且我们的伤亡比兰封战斗减少了三分之二，部队不断打胜仗，不断缴枪、捉俘虏，战士愈打愈想打，一说打，他们满身有劲，这就是成功的原因。孙连长说到这里，满脸笑容，他的心情是兴奋而且快乐的。
