　　Winter Production Can Lead to Wealth
　　Dongyangguan: Earns 1.5 Million After Filling the Gaps Movement
　　Xiazhuang: Earns 1.6 Million Through Weaving and Transportation
　　[Report from Changzhi by this newspaper] After the thorough liquidation and land reform movement before autumn, Dongyangguan in Licheng County achieved "filling the gaps and making up the differences," completing land reform and greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses for production. Immediately after the harvest, the town turned to winter production, earning 1,510,000 yuan in twenty days. Cooperative shares increased by 1,238,200 yuan, with 320 households joining. The Nanpo Lane, under the leadership of Li Xiaoquan and Xu Qiqing, organized 10 laborers, 3 horses, 8 mules, 2 donkeys, and 10 carts to transport goods between Changzhi and Shexian County. Each trip took seven days, with three trips a month and the remaining nine days for preparing for assignments. Their team made a total of three trips, earning more than 770,000 yuan. The thirteen animals and ten people needed 55,800 yuan for expenses per trip, totaling 167,400 yuan for the three trips. After deducting expenses, they still earned 602,853 yuan. The movement also resolved the contradiction between cadres and production. Because Dongyangguan is a market town with too many assignments, cadres were too busy to participate in transportation. Therefore, the town implemented leadership by lane and rotating duty, giving everyone the opportunity to participate in production, thus boosting enthusiasm for production. The political director, Li Jitang, once organized ten carters for transportation. (Chang Qun, Yan Liang, Fu Xiang, Kai Xin, Bu Gao, Nai Qi)
　　[Report from Licheng by this newspaper] Xiazhuang Village in this county earned more than 1,600,000 yuan in two months of winter production. Village cadres, labor heroes, and activists organized twelve small cooperatives and one transportation team and three porter teams in early September of the lunar calendar. Out of the village's 189 laborers and 109 animals, 136 laborers and 87 animals were organized. From early September to early November of the lunar calendar, they have spun 385 catties of cotton, woven 297.4 zhang of cloth, and 96 towels. In addition to cotton ginning, cotton fluffing, oil pressing, flour milling, and transportation, they have earned a net profit of 1,649,600 yuan. At the monthly production summary meeting on the 29th of last month, the village further proposed: to organize all the village's labor and animals (except for the disabled and sick) to carry out a larger-scale winter production movement in the next three months.

　　冬季生产能致富
    东阳关：填补运动后赚百五十万
    霞庄：纺织运输得洋百六十万
    【本报长治讯】黎城东阳关经过秋前的彻底清算翻身的查减运动，全镇做到了填平补齐，完成了土地改革，群众生产情绪大大提高。收耕结束后，当即转入冬季生产，二十天赚洋一百五十一万元，合作社股金增加一百二十三万八千二百元，入股户三百二十户。南坡巷在李小全、徐起清领导下，组织人力十个、马三匹、骡八头、驴两头、拉大车十辆，从长治到涉县之间往返运输，每次七天，一月运三次，其余九天准备支差。他们队共运三次，共赚洋七十七万多元。十三头牲口十个人，一次共需支洋五万五千八百元，三次共需十六万七千四百元，除费用还赚洋六十万二千八百五十三元。在运动中还解决了干部与生产矛盾，因东阳关是集镇，差务过多，干部工作忙不能参加运输，便实行分巷领导，轮流值日，大家都有了生产机会，生产情绪提高，政治主任李计堂一次即组织十辆大车夫运输。（长群、砚良、富祥、开心、步高、乃奇）
