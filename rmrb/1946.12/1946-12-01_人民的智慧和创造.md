The Wisdom and Creativity of the People
    Sand as Flux for Fast and Efficient Iron Smelting
    Domestically Produced Bleaching Powder, Locally Made Canvas
    Health Materials Factory Invents Evaporator

[This Newspaper reports] In recent months, many new inventions and creations have emerged in the Taihang area's production increase competition. In the munitions industry: Wang Qingxiang of the ×× Bomb Factory invented a punch for punching fuse paper, saving one-third of the labor compared to the original tool. He also created a new method of cutting fuses, increasing efficiency sevenfold. Li Hezhi and Li Weirong of the iron smelting department invented using sand as a flux, making iron smelting faster and better. Workers at the factory collectively invented a new type of medicine-making bucket, a crimping machine, and more. Workers in the ×× magnetic zone invented and fired various "magnetic mines," which, after testing, proved to have good killing power. In dyeing and weaving: Chang Meicai, Tang Kemin, and others at the Taihang Industrial Research Institute used locally produced raw materials to make blue and camel-colored wool dyes. The former involves grinding two liang of limonite into a fine powder, adding one liang of sulfuric acid, and after it becomes a yellow powder, dissolving it in water to remove the residue, then adding one liang of five-fold liquid. The latter has two methods of preparation: (1) Dry walnut green peel in the sun, put it in a pot and cook for three or four hours, remove the residue and add alum. (2) Soak ten jin of walnut green peel in fifteen jin of water for three or four days, then put it in a pot and cook for three hours, remove the residue, add alum, and boil it into a paste. Four liang of this paste can dye half a jin of wool. In Pingshun, Shuangshe all used thirty jin of lacquer wood, peeled and chopped, added one hundred and eighty jin of clean water, boiled for ten hours, removed the residue, added four liang of alum, and mixed it with seven jin of mashed pear leaves to dye a hundred feet of red cloth. Ning Jiulin of the Third District of Yushe used one jin of black bean skin, diluted with water, put it in a pot, crushed lead ore (half a jin) from coal into powder, waited for the bean skin water to boil, put the powder into the pot, then added one or two liang of alum, put in a zhang of wet cloth, boiled and shook it, and after half an hour, it becomes very beautiful black cloth. Zanhuang Yuji Towel Factory uses lime and alkali to bleach towels. The method is to use thirty jin of lime, eight jin of local alkali, add a pot of water, stir and boil, and after the alkali and lime are dissolved, use an iron ladle to scoop it into another vat, then use a wooden stick to pick up the towels, put them into the vat one by one, immerse them, then put them in a cage and steam them, and then wash them clean with water. The factory used this method to bleach 10,000 towels, saving 140,000 yuan. Shi Gaidi, a female hero of Xiangyuan, used a local cloth machine to weave foreign cloth and canvas like foreign products. Her methods are: (1) The yarn must be fine and tight, (2) The yarn should be starched with raw flour paste, (3) The canvas yarn must be twisted together, and tight and even. Zhao Jiuzhou of Shexian Work-Study School invented using thread heddles instead of steel heddles. The method is to use a piece of wood board, with two nailhead tacks eight inches long nailed on both ends, and two in the middle, two fen apart, leaving a heddle eye. Then use first-class fine thread three strands twisted together, then three strands twisted together, wax it, put it on the nailhead and tie it, tie ten of them, use a rope to hold them down and touch them. One day can tie five hundred roots. In this way, one machine can save 6,750 yuan. Other examples include the water pump belts used in the Changzhi Tap Water Company, which were originally imported, both expensive and difficult to buy. Workers Tian Jiesong and others carefully studied and successfully replaced them with modified ones (twenty replaced one). This creation saves 300,000 yuan annually in buying belts. The iron factory in the Fifth District of Huguan uses a small square fan to replace bellows, producing one-third more iron per furnace and saving one-half of the labor. The Health Materials Factory invented evaporators and sterilizers. According to preliminary test results: to increase production, from March to July, in four and a half months, using stove fire to steam, a total of 27,512 ampoules of injection fluid were produced. After using the evaporator, from August onwards, 34,620 ampoules of injection fluid were produced in seventy days. In the past, injection fluid was disinfected in small casseroles, only two hundred ampoules at a time, but now, with a sterilizer, six hundred ampoules are disinfected per day, and it is also more convenient. Previously, stove fire distillation required a total of 130 jin of coke per day and night. Now, it requires a total of 200 jin of black charcoal, which can save more than 200,000 yuan per year at market prices. Maolong and Zhenliang of the Second District Printing Factory of Yushe successfully replaced peach gum with a mixture of apricot oil, peach oil, and broom stalks. It is soaked in water first, and the effect is even better than peach gum.

　　人民的智慧和创造
    砂子做熔剂化铁快又好
    土产漂白粉土机织帆布
    卫生材料厂发明蒸发器
    【本报讯】近数月来，太行各业在增产竞赛中，出现不少新的发明和创造。军火业方面：××炸弹厂王庆祥发明冲拉火纸用的冲子，较用原工具省工三分之一。又创造剪导火线新办法，效率增强七倍。化铁部李何枝、李会荣发明以砂子做熔剂，使铁化的又快又好。该厂工友并集体发明新式制药斗，压壑机等。××磁区工人发明烧制各种“磁雷”，经试用，杀伤力良好。染织方面：太行工业研究所常美才、唐克敏等用土产原料制成蓝色、驼色染毛颜料。前者系将褐铁矿二两研细加硫酸一两，俟成黄色粉沫后，用水溶解、去渣，再加一两五倍子液即成。后者制法有二：（一）核桃青反经日光晒干，放锅内煮三、四小时，去渣加明矾即成。（二）核桃青皮十斤加水十五斤浸三、四日后，放锅内煮三小时去渣加矾，再熬成膏即成。此膏四两可染毛半斤。平顺双射全用漆木三十斤去皮砍碎，加清水一百八十斤前沸十小时，去渣，加白矾四两再与捣烂之棠梨叶七斤混合，即能染成百尺红布。榆社三区宁九林用黑豆皮一斤，用水淌开，放在锅里，把煤里的铅石（半斤）碾成面，待豆皮水开后，把面放进锅里，再放一两青矾，把一丈湿透的布放入，一面煮，一面抖，半点钟后就成很漂亮的黑布。赞皇裕记毛巾厂用石灰与碱漂白毛巾。其法用石灰卅斤，土碱八斤，加一锅水，边搅边煮，碱、灰溶化后，用铁杓掏到另一缸内，再将毛巾用木棍挑起，一块一块的放入缸内浸过，再放进笼蒸一下，然后清水洗净便成了。该厂用此漂了一万条毛巾，省洋达十四万元。襄垣女英雄史改弟用土布机织出了和外来品一样的洋布、帆布。其办法为：（一）纱要细要紧，（二）浆纱用生面糊，（三）帆布纱须合股，并紧而匀。涉县工读学校赵九洲发明以线铮代钢铮。制法用一块木板，上面八寸长的两端钉上没帽洋钉两个，中间也钉两个，相距二分远，留出综眼。然后用头等细线三合股，再合成三合股，用蜡打过，套在洋钉上结，结成十个，用绳界住摸下来。一天能结五百根。如此一架机可省洋六千七百五十元。其他如长治自来水公司机器上用的皮带原用舶来品，既贵又难买到，工人田捷松等细心研究，卒以改造水代替成功（二十个改造一个）。这一创造，每年省买皮带洋三十万元。壶关五区铁厂以小方煽车代替风箱，每炉多产铁三分之一，省工二分之一卫生材料厂发明蒸发器、灭菌器。据初步试验成绩如下：增加产量，从三月份到七月份，四个半月的时间，用炉火蒸，共出注射液二万七千五百一十二支。用蒸发器后，从八月起，七十天就出注射液三万四千六百二十支。过去注射液消毒，是用小沙锅，每次只二百支，现在用灭菌器，每天六百支，而且方便。以前炉火蒸馏，一昼夜共需焦炭一百三十斤。现在共需黑炭二百斤，按市价每年可节省二十余万元。榆社二区印刷厂茂龙、珍亮等同志以杏树油、桃树油、箕竿的混合物代替桃胶成功，先用水泡过，功效比桃胶还好。
