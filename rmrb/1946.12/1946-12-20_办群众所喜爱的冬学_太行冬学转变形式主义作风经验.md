Running Winter Studies that the Masses Love
--The Taihang Winter Study Transformation of Formalism Work Style Experience
　　Our Newspaper Research Institute

　　The Winter Study movement in Taihang once had the following situation: due to the leadership's inability to break away from the shackles of formalism and dogmatism, running winter studies became a burden for both cadres and the masses. A family member of a soldier in Licheng said: "The government is good at everything, it would be even better if it could give us preferential treatment and let us not attend winter studies!" The masses regarded winter study as a form of forced labor. In the winter study of 1943, the task of deepening current affairs education and breaking the thought of "the heavens changing" was proposed. The leadership summarized the past failures of rote learning and, through hands-on exploration, discovered that using mass-based introspective discussion methods was very effective. The masses had thoughts of "the heavens changing," but no one dared to say it directly. By using the topic of "thinking about the past and comparing it with the present" in a casual discussion method, the masses naturally thought about the suffering they had endured in the past and the benefits of today, as well as the problem of the Eighth Route Army's small strength in the past and its great strength today. Some even further revealed what someone had said about the "heavens changing." As the discussions increased, the true face of the special agents was completely exposed. Some who had already joined the special agent organizations were educated in this situation and confessed voluntarily. In the winter study in Henan Village, She County, after the masses initially recognized the comparison of the enemy and our strengths, a "conscience movement" was launched, and many people spoke their conscience. Farmers who had always been backward spoke their conscience about not mixing sand in the public grain they handed over. This inspired many people to examine shortcomings such as not loving the army and deliberately making military shoes that were not durable. In Zhao Village Winter Study, the government's burden policy was explained, and the masses were encouraged to boldly raise questions and engage in discussions. As a result, not only was the burden work promoted, but after the masses understood that planting more land did not necessarily mean more burden, their enthusiasm for production was increased, and the land price in the village immediately rose. In this situation, the shortcomings of another dogmatic teaching method became more obvious: an unpaid teacher in Maicang Village, Licheng, had lectured the masses seven times on orthodox thought and twice on the thought of "the heavens changing," but no one spoke during the discussions. He invariably claimed that the Eighth Route Army was strong. The method of rigidly failing to connect with the masses' thoughts and not guiding the masses to speak was obviously a failure. The Taihang Xinhua Daily News made a powerful comparison of the two methods, which played a considerable role in promoting them, and many villages, based on the newspaper, examined their own winter studies.

　　During the rent reduction campaign in the winter of 1944, winter studies in various villages in Pingshun launched a "speak bitterness" campaign, recognizing what exploitation was from speaking bitterness, and then discussing issues such as whether rent should be paid. The masses' enthusiasm for participating in the ideological movement was extremely high. The masses said: This is a truth that has not been clarified for generations, and it must be clarified. Fathers and sons, husbands and wives, after attending winter study, still argued at home. Once a person understood the truth, he told everyone he met. This further proved that the method of enlightening the masses and educating the masses from their own personal experiences was correct. In 1945, this method was spread to the new district. Before and after the Changzhi campaign, the masses' thoughts of "the heavens changing" were very serious. The Eighth Route Army stayed put. In the winter study discussion in XX Village, someone told the story of being captured by the enemy in the past to sweep the base area and then being beaten back by the militia. Everyone believed that as long as the armed forces were organized, there would be no fear of the "heavens changing."

　　Many local model volunteer teachers summarized this teaching method as "feeling out minds." That is to say, it is necessary to educate the masses starting from the masses' thoughts. A very important method here is to use activists. By having the activists speak their own minds, everyone can be promoted. Some places mechanically moved the topic of "thinking about the past and comparing it with the present" without "feeling out minds" and forced the masses to introspect, which also ran into obstacles.

　　Changing the forced enrollment method and adhering to the voluntary enrollment method in winter study leadership was also not feasible at first. Many cadres stubbornly held onto the lesson that winter studies could not be run without coercion, believing that "voluntary" was fundamentally impossible. Fan Qingshan, a model volunteer teacher in She County, resolutely tried to implement the policy of voluntary enrollment. He first changed the winter study method, spread the word that it was voluntary to let the masses talk about it, then mobilized individually, and called for it at the conference. As a result, sixty to seventy people signed up. He started the class in this way, forming groups according to the needs of the masses—literacy, learning the abacus, learning whatever they liked, and to save time, he taught them as they came. In ideological education, he adopted the method of "feeling out minds." For example, if he wanted to carry out support for the army and introspection, knowing that the masses did not dare to say bad things about the army, he would say it himself first, and the masses would also start talking. Later, he discovered that the masses were afraid to record (a staff member taking notes) and did not dare to speak, so he immediately explained it, and the introspection was very good. Because these methods were adopted, the number of people increased to 380. One winter study place was not enough, so four places were opened.

　　In summary, in 1944, Taihang used the following methods in implementing the policy of voluntary enrollment: (1) Launch a mass summary movement so that everyone knows that the past forced method of winter study was wrong. (2) Voluntarily combine groups according to the needs of the masses, teaching them as they come, without excessive delay. (3) The teaching method is flexible, carrying out mass ideological reflection, using the masses' own experience to educate themselves. (4) Appropriately solve the difficulties of the masses: If the masses want to produce and also want to study, they must be helped to solve how to study in production. If the discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law affects learning, they must be helped to mediate. Otherwise, often one or two people's uneasiness in learning will affect everyone, and their transformation will often more powerfully promote everyone's enthusiasm. In short, it is important to go deep into the masses and improve them according to their needs.

　　Since 1943, in many areas of Taihang, winter study has not only not been a burden, but has also become the locomotive for promoting various tasks, rent reduction, support for the army, anti-special agents... none of them can be done well without the ideological education of winter study. Matian, Zuoquan, used to be a model village. No problems could be found no matter how rent reduction work was carried out. In the winter study's anti-"heavens changing" thought, the village cadres even reflected on the fact that they had rented land and failed to thoroughly reduce rent because they were afraid of the "heavens changing." There are many other similar examples.

　　The purpose of all these materials is to explain a method, that is to say, to run a winter study that the masses love, it must be voluntary enrollment, organized learning according to the needs of the masses, and connected with the masses' thoughts to improve the masses' awareness. Dogmatic rote learning methods must be resolutely abandoned. Such winter studies will play a major role in promoting practical work and should not be burdened with formalism and, conversely, underestimate their value.

　　办群众所喜爱的冬学
    ——太行冬学转变形式主义作风经验
    本报研究所
    冬学运动在太行，曾经有过这样的情况：由于领导上摆脱不开形式主义与教条主义的束缚，办冬学无论对干部对群众都成了包袱。黎城一个抗属说：“政府啥也好，能优待咱不上冬学才更好呢！”群众把冬学当成支差了。一九四三年冬学提出了深入时事教育，打破变天思想的任务，领导上总结了过去填鸭式教育失败经验，在亲自动手的摸索中，才发现了用群众性的反省讨论方法很有劲。群众中有变天思想，但谁也不敢正面说，以想想过去，比比现在做题目用漫谈方法，群众很自然的就想到过去自己所受的痛苦与今天的好处，过去八路军力量小今天力量大的问题。有的就更进一步的扯出自己听什么人说过要变天的话，大家谈得多了，特务面目就完全暴露了。还有些已参加了特务组织在这种情况下得到教育而自动坦白。涉县河南店冬学里在群众初步认清了敌我力量的对比后，开展了良心运动，很多人说出人良心话。一向很落后的农民，说出自己交公粮不应掺沙的良心话。从而启发了很多人都检查出不爱护军队、做军鞋故意做不结实等缺点。赵庄冬学解释政府负担政策，让群众大胆提出疑问，展开讨论，结果不仅推动了负担工作，而且在群众懂得多种地不一定多出负担的道理后，提高了生产积极性，马上村里的地价就提高了。在这种情况下，另一种教条主义教学方法缺点更加明显：黎城麦仓村义务教员，曾给群众讲过七次正统思想，二次变天思想，但讨论时大家都不发言。言必称八路军力量大。死不能接近群众思想，不引导群众发言的办法明显失败了。太行新华日报曾有力的对比两种方法，起了不小的推动作用，很多村庄，依据报纸，检查了自己的冬学。
    四四年冬季查减，平顺各村冬学都展开了诉苦，从诉苦中认识什么是剥削，从而讨论到该交租不该交租等问题，群众参加思想运动的热情极高，群众说：这是几辈子也没弄清楚的道理，一定要弄清楚，父子、夫妻过了冬学回到家里还在争论。一个人懂得了道理后逢人就讲。这就更加证明了从群众自己切身的经验，启发群众教育群众的办法正确。四五年这个办法传到了新区，长治战役前后，该地群众变天思想很利害，八路军呆住，××村在冬学讨论中有人讲出自己过去被敌人抓去扫荡根据地，后来被民兵打回来的故事，大家就相信了：只要组织武装就不怕变天。
    许多地方的模范义务教员总结这种教学方法叫做“摸心思”。就是说要从群众的思想出发教育群众，这里很重要的一个办法是运用积极分子，经过积极分子讲出自己的心思，就可以推动大家。有些地方不通过摸心思而机械搬运想想过去比比现在的题目，硬让群众反省，结果也碰了壁。
    改变强迫入学，坚持自愿入学的冬学领导方法上，起初也行不通。很多干部固执非强迫不能办冬学的教训，认为“自愿”根本办不到。涉县模范义务教员范青山，坚决试行自愿入学的方针，他先把冬学改变办法，要自愿的风声传出去让群众嚷嚷，然后个别动员，并在大会上号召，结果报名的六七十人。他就这样开课了，按群众的需要编组——识字、学算盘、爱学啥参加啥，而且为了省时间，随来随教。在思想教育上采取摸心思办法，如要进行拥军反省，知道群众不敢说对军队的坏处，就自己先说，群众也就说开了。后来又发现群众怕记（一位工作员写记录）不敢说，马上就作了解释，结果反省得很好。因为采取了这些办法，人数增加到三百八十人。一处冬学放不下了，开了四处。
    综合四四年太行各地在运用自愿入学的方针上有以下的办法：（一）开展一个群众性的总结运动，让大家都知道过去冬学的强迫办法不对。（二）按群众的需要自愿结合小组，随来随教，不要过分拖时间。（三）教学方法灵活，开展群众性的思想反省，用群众自己经验教育自己。（四）适当解决群众困难：如群众想生产又想学习，就要替他解决怎样在生产中学习，婆媳不和影响学习，就要帮他调解，否则往往一二人学习不安会影响大家，而他们的转变往往更有力的推动大家的热劲。总之深入群众，按群众的需要提高群众很重要。
    从四三年以来，太行很多地区冬学不仅不是累赘，而且成了推动各种工作的火车头，查减、拥军、反特……那一样离开了冬学的思想教育都做不好。左权麻田曾经是模范村，查减工作怎样查也发现不了问题，冬学中反变天思想，村干部竟反省出自己租地，因怕变天未彻底减租。其他类似的例子还很多。
    所有这些材料，我们的目的在于说明一个方法，就是说要办一个群众所喜爱的冬学，必需是自愿入学，按群众需要组织学习，连系群众思想提高群众觉悟。教条主义的填鸭方法，必须坚决抛弃。这样的冬学在推动实际工作上将会发挥重大作用不应该自己背上形式主义包袱反过来倒轻视他的价值。
