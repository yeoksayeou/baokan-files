    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: General Pan Shuoduan, commander of the First Army of the Democratic Allied Forces, recently issued a statement regarding Chiang Kai-shek's convening of a one-party "National Assembly" and the attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. General Pan stated that Chiang Kai-shek's failure to abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and his blatant convening of a one-party-controlled "National Assembly" despite the opposition of the people of the entire country is clear evidence of his determination to implement fascist dictatorship. Our army stands on the side of the people and firmly opposes it. Moreover, the so-called National Assembly representatives were designated more than a decade ago, and some are even traitors; what qualifications do they have to represent the people? General Pan also affirmed that Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to attack Yan'an is his last struggle, which can only end in failure. He said that Yan'an is the center of the national liberated areas, and the people have a long history of struggle. The invading Chiang's troops will encounter even greater disastrous defeat there than in other liberated areas.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: A Moscow broadcast on the 5th, commenting on the China issue, said that the National Assembly has increasingly become an object of popular resentment, and the participation of the Youth Party and the Socialist Party has been widely despised by public opinion. The CCP and the Democratic League's refusal to participate in this National Assembly has dealt a serious political blow to the Kuomintang.

    潘朔端将军发表谈话
    坚决反对一党国大
    莫斯科广播评论：中国人民鄙视青年党民社党
    【新华社东北六日电】民主同盟军第一军军长潘朔端将军，顷就蒋介石召开一党“国大”及进攻陕甘宁边区事发表谈话。潘将军首谓蒋介石不遵守政协决议，不顾全国人民反对，悍然召开一党包办的“国大”乃是决心执行法西斯独裁的明证。本军站在人民立场，坚决反对。且所谓国大代表均系十几年前圈定，有些甚至是汉奸国贼，有什么资格代表人民？潘将军并肯定的认为蒋介石企图进攻延安乃其最后挣扎，除失败外别无其他前途。他说延安是全国解放区的中心，人民有长期奋斗的历史，进犯的蒋军将在那里遇到比在其他解放区更大的惨败。
    【新华社延安六日电】莫斯科五日广播评论中国问题时说，国大已日益成为人民憎恶的对象，青年党与社会党的参加，得到广泛舆论的鄙视。中共与民主同盟拒绝参加这个国大，已给国民党一个严重的政治打击。
