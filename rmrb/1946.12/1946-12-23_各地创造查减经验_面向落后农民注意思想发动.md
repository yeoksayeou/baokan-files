　　Various Places Create Experience in Checking Reductions
    Pay Attention to Ideological Mobilization Facing Backward Peasants
    Changzi County Convenes Meetings of People Who Don't Speak Up
    [Our Newspaper News] Comprehensive reports from various places: In the old liberated areas' movement to check rent reduction and interest rate reduction, facing backward elements and paying attention to ideological mobilization is extremely important. Wuxiang cadres reviewed the past several movements and found that they had neglected in-depth mobilization, resulting in poor ideological awareness among the masses. In some villages, after beating the local tyrants, some peasants still pitied them and dared not accept the distributed fruits. The review clarified the importance of facing backward elements and ideologically mobilizing all the masses. In Shipo and Kuangmen villages in Shexian County, through winter school typical grievance sessions, awareness was raised, and the masses' fighting spirit was inspired, clarifying the goals of the struggle, which vigorously promoted the movement to check reductions. Changzi County conducted an in-depth review in each district and universally convened meetings of activists and people who don't speak up, finding that many people who don't speak up had not thoroughly turned over a new leaf. Through discussion and education, their fighting enthusiasm was inspired. Qin County’s Nan Chen pilot village, through careful door-to-door research, discovered that 43 relatively backward households had not turned over a new leaf. Through individual interviews with grievance of turning-over heroes, six people who didn't speak up also actively participated in the struggle and spoke out their sufferings, and the experience was gained: if you mention the painful spot of those who don’t speak up, they will become aware and naturally generate the fighting enthusiasm of “speaking of illness and risking one’s life.” Yang Donglai used to not speak up, but this time his struggle was more active than anyone else. Now all the masses in Nan Chen have risen up, further deepening the movement. (Details of the mobilization method can be found in yesterday's newspaper) Wu'an, in the second great check on turning over a new leaf, reviewed that some villages, due to cadres' substitution and paternalistic work style and simple orders, did not sufficiently mobilize the masses and did not improve their awareness. Many tasks had to be completed by orders. The review proposed to intensify education for these masses who "have turned over a new leaf in life but have not turned over a new leaf in their minds" to fill the gaps in their thinking.

　　各地创造查减经验
    面向落后农民注意思想发动
    长子县召集不吭气人开会
    【本报讯】综合各地报导：老区查减运动中，面向落后与注意思想发动，十分重要。武乡干部检查了过去几次运动，忽略了深入发动，群众思想觉悟很差，有的村打了恶霸，部分农民还可怜他，分给果实也不敢要。从检查中明确了面向落后，把全体群众从思想上发动起来的重要。涉县石泊、匡门等村，经过冬学典型诉苦，提高觉悟，启发了群众斗争情绪，明确了斗争目标，查减运动才有力开展起来。长子深入检查各区普遍召开积极分子与不吭气人的大会，发现许多不吭气的人，翻身很不彻底，经过讨论教育，启发了他们的斗争热情。沁县南陈基点村经挨门挨户的仔细研究，发现有四十三户较落后的群众没翻身，通过翻身英雄个别访苦，有六个不吭气的人也积极起来斗争诉苦，并得出经验：不吭气的人，只要说到他的痛处，他会觉悟起来，会自然产生：“说着病，舍上命。”的斗争热情。杨东来过去不吭气，这次斗争比谁也积极。现南陈群众全部起来，推进运动更深入了一步。（发动办法详见昨日本报）武安在二次翻身大检查中，检讨出有些村因干部代替包办作风，简单命令，使群众发动不够，觉悟没有提高，很多任务都得靠命令完成。检查中提出对这些“生活翻了身，脑筋没翻身”的群众，加紧教育，填补脑筋上的窟窿。
