　　Taiyue, December 15th (From our Newspaper) Wu Daolong, an arch-counter-settler, was a major tyrant in Yucheng Village, Lingshi. He served as the head of Yan Xishan's "Revenge Corps," carrying out counter-settlement and murdering over 70 farmers. On November 30th, he was captured from his home in Yucheng Village by local militiamen using the "eagle catching chicken" tactic. On November 21st, when Wu Daolong was escorted to Xixu Village, surrounding farmers surged in like a tide, carrying guns and knives, seeking revenge. The first to rush towards Wu Daolong to avenge his parents was Yang Lan, the 14-year-old son of the Farmers' Association chairman of Tangtang Village. He sobbed, saying, "My father led the entire village's farmers to reduce rent and settle accounts with the landlords, wanting to turn things around. You led the 'Revenge Corps' to kill my parents and seize all my family property. Today, I will demand my life and property back from you!" Following him was the husband of Lan Guichun, a victim's relative, who wailed, "On April 3rd, my brother asked you to reduce rent, and on the 5th, you assassinated him, cut off his limbs, chopped him into three pieces, and dug out his heart. When we retrieved his body, it was already mush..." At this moment, everyone in the crowd was in tears. Wu Daolong was the enemy of 30,000 farmers in Lingshi, so people coming to speak of their suffering and seek revenge were endless. Wu Daolong was executed on the spot by the farmers, which gave the counter-settlement elements in Lingshi a severe blow.

　　灵石农民持枪诉苦复仇
    处死倒算头子吴道龙
    【本报太岳十五日电】倒算头子吴道龙是灵石玉成村一大恶霸，担任阎锡山的“复仇团”团长，进行倒算，杀害农民七十余人。上月三十日被当地民兵以“鹰抓鸡”战法从玉成村住家捕获。上月二十一日当吴道龙被押至西许村时，周围农民潮水似的持枪携刀的涌来复仇，首先冲向吴道龙面前为父母复仇的，是汤汤村农会主席杨兰十四岁之幼子，他哭不成声的说：“我父亲领导全村农民向地主减租算账要翻身，你带领‘复仇团’将我父母全杀死，并抢去了我全部家产，今天我要向你讨生命财产账。”接着是被害农民家属兰贵春之夫，嚎啕大哭的说：“四月三日，我哥向你要求减租，五日即被你暗杀了，并割掉四肢，切成三块，挖出心脏，找回尸首来已成肉泥了……”此时人群中无不落泪。吴道龙是灵石三万农民的仇人，所以诉苦复仇的人源源不绝，吴道龙当场被农民处决，这给灵石倒算分子一个严重的打击。
