　　International Week
    December 8th to 14th
        Two Major Conferences Approaching Conclusion
    Over the past week, the two major conferences in New York have been moving towards conclusion in a coordinated manner.
    The Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers held its last meeting of the current session on the 12th. All details of the five-nation peace treaties have been fully agreed upon. The Four Powers will formally sign the treaties in Paris on February 10th next year. Thus, after five sessions lasting fifteen months, the five-nation peace treaties have finally been completed. This is the result of mutual understanding between the three major powers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, as well as the joint efforts and supervision of democratic forces inside and outside the conferences. The Four Foreign Ministers also decided that the next session will be held in Moscow on March 1st next year. The procedure for discussing the German and Austrian issues at the next session has been agreed upon.
    The United Nations General Assembly is focusing on three major issues: (1) The Disarmament Committee has adopted general principles. (2) The issue of investigating the stationing of troops is being re-examined by the General Assembly's Political Committee. Initially, the Soviet Union and France advocated investigating only foreign troops, while the United States and Britain advocated investigating domestic troops as well. Later, the Soviet Union proposed that if domestic troops were investigated, it should also include weapons. The British side suggested that if weapons were investigated, an international supervision system should be established, to which the Soviet side has agreed. (3) Regarding the issue of opposing Franco's Spain, it has been resolved that all countries recall their ambassadors to Spain. Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have agreed, while the United States opposes it. The United Nations General Assembly is now accelerating its work, aiming to open within this week.
            Astonishing Development of Democratic Forces
    In the past week, the democratic forces in two countries have seen astonishing development: One is the continuous demonstrations by civil servants, women, and students in the streets of Tokyo, Japan. The "Down with Yoshida" movement is flourishing. On the 17th, mass rallies led by the Federation of Labor Unions will be held across the country to overthrow the cabinet. It is clear that MacArthur's measures to support reaction and intimidate democracy will become increasingly futile. The other is the self-defense guerrilla warfare of the Greek People's Liberation Army, which has spread throughout the country. The reactionary government in Athens wants to continue seeking assistance from Britain and plans to appeal to the Security Council, fabricating accusations that Bulgaria and Yugoslavia are aiding the Liberation Army. The absurd claims that "the Greek guerrillas have been eliminated" have now vanished.
        French Communist Party and Socialist Party Unite Closely
    Negotiations for the formation of a cabinet in France are still ongoing. After consultations among various parties, the leader of the Socialist Party, Blum, has been selected to serve as the interim Prime Minister. The reactionaries' plot to split the French Communist Party and the Socialist Party has ultimately failed. Of course, there are still many difficulties on the path of struggle for the French people. But there is absolutely no doubt that they will achieve final victory.
            The More Reactionary the United States Becomes, the More Difficulties Increase
    The major coal miners' strike in the United States has ended. The Truman administration is planning to restrict people's rights (especially labor rights), which is noteworthy in the American political situation. This tendency towards totalitarianism will undoubtedly be widely opposed by the American people. And the difficulties of American imperialism will be unprecedentedly aggravated by the economic crisis that will soon erupt. According to a recent article by Soviet economic authority Varga, the arrival of this crisis will be no later than 1948.

　　国际一周
    十二月八日到十四日
        两大会议走向结束
    一周来纽约两大会议以协调的步伐走向结束。
    四强外长会议于十二日举行本届会议的最后一次集会，五国和约中的所有细节已全部达到协议，四强将于明年二月十日在巴黎正式签字。至此经过五次集会，历时十五个月的五国和约终于完成了。这是英苏美三强互相谅解的结果，也是会议内外世界民主势力共同努力与督促的结果。四外长又决定下届会议于明年三月一日在莫斯科举行，下届会议讨论德、奥两国问题的程序已议定。
    联合国大会集中处理三大问题：（１）裁军问题委员会已通过一般原则。（２）调查驻军问题，正由大会政治委员会重审。开始苏、法都主张仅调查驻外军队，美英则主张调查国内军队。后来苏联提议如调查国内军队，则亦应包括武器。英方建议若调查武器则须建立国际监督制度，苏方已同意。（３）反对佛朗哥西班牙问题，已决议各国召回驻西使节，英、法、苏同意，美国则反对。联合国大会现正加速工作，期于本周内开幕。
            民主力量惊人发展
    过去一周内，两个国家的民主力量有惊人的发展：一为日本东京街头连日接踵发生，公务员妇女学生的示威游行，“打倒吉田”的运动正蓬勃展开。十七日全国各地将召开以联工会为首的倒阁群众大会，眼见麦克阿瑟扶持反动威吓民主的措施将日渐徒劳心拙了。一为希腊人民解放军的自卫游击战争遍及全境，雅典反动政府想再继续向英求援，并图向安理会控诉，捏造保南两国援助解放军。所谓“希腊游击队已被消灭”的奇谈，如今已烟消云散了。
        法共与社会党紧相团结
    法国的组阁谈判仍继续中，临时政府总理几经各党磋商，业已选定社会党党魁勃伦姆担任。反动派图分裂法共与社会党的阴谋卒未得逞。当然，法国人民的斗争道路上，还摆着很多困难。但他们必定得到最后胜利是决然无疑的了。
            美国越反动困难越增加
    美国煤矿大罢工业已结束，杜鲁门政府正策划限制人民权利（特别是劳工权利），这是美国政局中值得注意的。极权主义的倾向，无疑将受到美国人民广泛的反对。而美国帝国主义的困难，将因不久就将爆发的经济危机而空前加剧。据苏经济学权威瓦尔加氏近撰文称：这一危机的到来，至迟不出一九四八年。
