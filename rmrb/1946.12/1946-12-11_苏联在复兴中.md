    The Soviet Union is in Recovery
    By: Rajagopallachari
    Translated by: Kui Jun
    United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Director Rajagopallachari recently visited the Soviet Union. This dispatch is a firsthand report of his first visit to the Soviet Union. From his article, we can see a microcosm of the Soviet Union's intensified peaceful construction. The original article was published in the American afternoon newspaper on September 1st. – Translator

    I have just left Minsk. I am writing this dispatch on my way to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. This is my first visit to the Soviet Union, and I am eager to see it. I do not pretend to know everything. In fact, a short stay of a few days makes it impossible to "know everything." To understand the achievements of this intricate economic system and novel government organization, a long period of residence is necessary. From my observation, I dare say that in Belarus, the wounds it suffered are profound.

    The Nazis almost completely destroyed the cities and villages, and the national and local governments are successfully overcoming the enormous difficulties caused by this destruction. Families and communities still need to be reunited, and the statistics of deaths and missing persons have not yet been completed.

    Despite the scarcity of building materials and the complete lack of heavy industrial machinery, reconstruction work has already begun – and is proceeding at a high speed. The farmers are working with ample energy and courage. Collective farms are being built in the ruins. Temporary improved houses are now inhabited by hardworking farming families.

    According to the distribution of land, a collective farm contains eighty to one hundred and fifty households. Each household has a unique piece of land for its own individual use, and the agricultural products and livestock can be sold or used for self-consumption. The communal land is cultivated jointly by everyone – each family shares the harvest according to the quality and quantity of its labor contribution. The success of the collective farm and the prosperity of the farmers, like private ownership, depends on the size of the land and the quality of the soil.

    In the cities, most of the industry and commerce have been nationalized. The determination of wages is based on the workers' skills and production value. Rations and food prices, rents, and necessities are determined based on the workers' wages. This economic system, though most intricate and complex – is quite effective.

    No one can say that the Soviet Union lacks creativity. Genius is particularly praised. The division of ranks based on instinct and duty is most obvious and effective. Regarding this issue, it will not take long to dispel misunderstandings.

    The training of unskilled workers to become skilled, the transformation of small businessmen into senior clerks and managers in schools, and other schools for learning higher skills, which were numerous before the war, are now being restored. Technical schools and specialized schools account for a very high proportion of the population. But in Minsk, these school institutions have been destroyed by artillery fire.

    The government's concern for children is most impressive. In Minsk alone – a city of 225,000 people – there are 30,000 war orphans. All these children receive tender care, and I have visited several of these institutions. The buildings have been repaired or partially rebuilt. The management and caregivers are excellent. That was the most thoughtful care I have ever seen, although the work is carried out under difficult conditions. The education program is also the best – every child has the opportunity to develop their personality and talent.

    The children are bright, lively, and happy. Their politeness and unexpectedly good attitude – proving that the group is joyful – is truly touching. There seems to be none of the repression commonly seen in school-educated children. Approaching and talking with them is natural and easy. They are natural and express their good training. Their humility is natural, not artificial.

    We visited the little girls aged three to seven. In another school were children aged seven to fourteen. This made it clear to me that appropriate teaching with gentle persuasion and loving kindness is the norm rather than the exception.

    These children have different types and proclivities. The little boys, like ours, want to be soldiers or firefighters, doctors or pilots. The girls mostly want to be teachers, dancers, or musicians.

    Among the older children, those with artistic talent are determined to enter conservatories, drama schools, or dance schools to pursue further studies. Several are entering specialized schools to become writers – which is particularly valued in the Soviet Union. These are the words of ordinary children – but they are true – several will naturally become engineers, engaging in more ordinary but useful professions.

    These children gave me a very deep impression. I know they are confident and unconstrained – I have heard them sing. I know they are happy and carefree – I have seen them dance.

    These children have difficult work ahead, but for this, they are receiving appropriate training.

### 苏联在复兴中

    苏联在复兴中
    拉迦第亚作
    葵军译
    联总署长拉迦第亚最近曾访问苏联。这篇通讯就是他初次访苏的一个实地报导。从他的文章中，我们可以看到苏联加紧和平建设的一个缩影。原文载九月一日美国下午报。——译者
    我刚离开明斯克。我在到乌克兰首都基辅的旅途上，写这篇通讯。这是我初次访问苏联，我渴望着看到它。我并不自命知道了所有的事物。事实上，短短几天的逗留，是不可能“知道一切”的。如果要了解这错综的经济体系和新奇的政府组织的成绩，必须长时期的居留。据我的观察，我敢说，在白俄罗斯，它所受的创伤是深重的。
    纳粹几乎彻底地破坏了城市和乡村，国家和地方的政府，正在顺利地克服着这种破坏所造成的巨大困难。家庭和社团还须重行结合，死亡和失踪人数的统计还没有完成。
    尽管建筑材料稀少，重工业机器完全缺乏，但重建的工作却已经开始了——而且正在高速度地进行着。农民们用着充足的精力和勇气工作。集体农场在废墟中建立起来。临时搭成的改良房屋，现在已居住着辛勤劳作的农民家庭。
    根据土地的分配，一个集体农场包含着八十到一百五十户的农家。每一农家有一块特有的土地，供自己单独使用，农产物和家畜也可出卖或自用。团体的田地是由众人共同耕种——每家得根据其所贡献劳力的质和量而分享收成。集体农场的成就和农民的富裕，与私有制一样，是靠着田地大小，以及土质的好坏决定的。
    在城市中，工商业大部已国家化了。工资的确定，是根据工人的工作技术和生产价值的。配给品和食物价格、房租和生活必需品，都是根据工人的工资来确定。这种经济体系虽是最错综而复杂——但都有相当成效。
    谁都全能说苏联缺乏创造力，那是很多的。天才特别受褒奖。等级的划分根据了本能和职务，是最显而易见，而且有效果。关于这问题，并不需要多久就能祛除误解。
    训练不熟练工人使成为熟练，使小商人们在学校中变成高级职员和经理人才，以及其他学习更高技能的学校，在战前原是很多，目前正在恢复中。技术学校和专科学校占人口很高的比例。但在明斯克，这些学校机关都已毁于炮火了。
    政府对于孩童的关注，最使人有深刻印象。单在明斯克——一个二十二万五千人口的城市——就有三万个战争孤儿。所有这些孩童，都受到温柔的照顾，我曾参观了几个这些机关。建筑物已经修缮或是由部分重建而成。管理和看护人员都是优秀的。那是我生平所见最周到的看护，虽然工作是在困难重重的条件下进行的。教育部分的计划也是最好的——每一个孩童都有发展个性和天才的机会。
    孩子们明亮、活泼而快乐。他们的礼貌及意外的良好的态度——证明那一群是愉快的——实在令人感动。他似乎没有在学校化孩童中所常见的那种压抑。和他们接近和谈话，是自然而容易。他们是自然的，并且表示出他们良好的训练。他们的谦和是自然的，而非人为的。
    我们访问了从三至七岁的小妮仔。在另一个学校是七至十四岁的孩童。这很使我清楚，用循循善诱及亲切仁爱的适当教导，是常规而非例外。
    这些孩子有着不同的类型和性癖。小的男孩，像我们的一样，要做兵士或救火员、医生或飞机师。女孩子们大都要做教师、舞蹈家或音乐家。
    在年龄较大的孩子中，有艺术天才的，都决定进入音乐院、戏剧学校或舞蹈学校，以求深造。有几个正进入专门学校成为作家——这在苏联是特别器重的。这些都是平常孩子的话语——然而是真实的——有几个自然要成为工程师，从事更平凡但是有用的职业。
    这些孩子给了我极深的印象。我知道他们是自信而无约束的——我听过他们唱歌。我知道他们是快乐而无忧虑的——我看过他们舞蹈。
    这些孩子们有着艰难的工作在前面，但是对于这点，他们正受到了适当的训练。
              完
