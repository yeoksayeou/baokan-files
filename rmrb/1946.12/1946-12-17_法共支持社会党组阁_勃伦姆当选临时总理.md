Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 13th: Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly elected Socialist leader Léon Blum as interim Prime Minister on the 11th. For a month, French political parties have held a series of negotiations to elect a Prime Minister. The French Communist Party (PCF) and the Socialist Party had reached an agreement to support the PCF leader Maurice Thorez as Prime Minister. However, during the election on the 4th of this month, the right wing of the Socialist Party violated the decision of the party congress and did not vote in favor, resulting in failing to reach the statutory majority by a difference of 51 votes. Subsequently, Bidault of the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) and Petit of the Radical Party also failed to be elected. In the past week, various parties have tried to reach an agreement on the issue of forming a cabinet. The PCF and the Socialist Party were willing to form a "left-center" cabinet, while the MRP and the Radical Party advocated forming a coalition cabinet including right-wing parties. The PCF insisted on opposing a cabinet headed by the MRP, while the MRP opposed a cabinet headed by the PCF. With the deadlock, the PCF turned to support the Socialist Party, the third largest party, to be responsible for forming a cabinet. As a result, Blum obtained almost unanimous support. The list of the newly elected cabinet has not yet been announced. According to the French News Agency, people in Washington expressed great welcome to Blum's election, but feared that Blum's election would only be temporary.

　　法共支持社会党组阁  勃伦姆当选临时总理
    【新华社延安十三日电】巴黎讯：法国国民议会于十一日选举社会党领袖莱翁·勃伦姆为临时政府总理。一月来法国各政党为选举总理曾分别举行一连串的谈判，法共与社会党曾就此达到协议，即支持法共领袖多列士任总理。但本月四日选举时，社会党右派违反该党代表大会决定而不投赞成票，以致因五十一票之差而未达法定之过半数，其后人民共和运动党之比道尔及急进党之白蒂特亦落选。在过去一周中各党力图对组阁问题达到协议。法共及社会党愿组“左翼中心”内阁，而人民共和运动党及急进党则主张组包括右翼党派之联合内阁。法共坚持反对以人民共和运动党为首之内阁，而人民共和运动党又反对以法共为首之内阁，僵持不下，法共乃转而支持第三大党的社会党负责组阁。于是勃伦姆乃获得几乎是全体一致的赞成票。当选新阁名单尚未宣布，据法国新闻处称：华盛顿方面人士对勃氏当选极表欢迎，但又唯恐勃氏之当选仅是暂时的。
