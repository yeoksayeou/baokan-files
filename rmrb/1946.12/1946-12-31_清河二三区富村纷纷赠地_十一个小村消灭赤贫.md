　　[Weixian Dispatch, December 28th] During the rent reduction movement in Qinghe’s second and third districts, farmers in wealthy villages demonstrated a high degree of class solidarity, generously donating land to poor villages. Those who donated land to other villages included Liu Baozhuang, who donated 63.5 mu; Wanxianzhuang, who donated 83 mu and 270,000 yuan; Zhangtun, who donated 19.5 mu; and Li Liuzhuang, who donated 43 mu, helping Xiaomatun, Zhang Wangxianzhuang, and eleven other villages to eliminate extreme poverty. The masses in Li Wangxianzhuang said excitedly, "This is truly a case of peasants all over the world being one family, this is the good policy of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" The masses in wealthy villages also said, "This approach is really good. The poor in our village have land to cultivate, and the poor in other villages have also turned themselves around. Only when everyone has food and drink can we unite to fight against Chiang Kai-shek."

　　清河二三区富村纷纷赠地
    十一个小村消灭赤贫
    【本报威县二十八日电】清河查减运动中，二、三区富村农民表现高度阶级友爱精神，纷纷向穷村赠地。往外村赠地者，计刘保庄六十三亩半，万仙庄八十三亩、款二十七万元，张屯十九亩半，李六庄四十三亩，帮助小马屯、张王仙庄等十一村消灭了赤贫。李王仙庄群众兴奋地说：“这真是天下农民是一家，这是共产党毛主席的好主张”。富村群众亦说：“这样做法真不错，咱村穷人有地种，外村穷人也翻了身，大家都有吃有喝，才能够团结一致来打老蒋啊。”
