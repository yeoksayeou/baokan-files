    [This Newspaper Taiyue 10th Dispatch] In certain mountain villages of Taiyue, after the land reform was realized, farmers still have many difficulties in their economic lives. Leading farmers in production has become the main issue for the future. In Licida First Village in Yangcheng, the feudal landlords such as Da Jiansan were overthrown, and feudal exploitation was completely eliminated. The very poor have completely obtained land. In Luotuo Yao Village in Yuanqu, four poor households, a total of twenty-three people, obtained fifty-eight mu of land, an average of 2.4 mu per person. Although both villages have realized "the tillers have their own land," the farmers' lives are still poor due to the soil being mostly sandy, the fields being terraced, and the output not being high. Moreover, handicraft industry and sideline occupations are underdeveloped, clothes are thin, and their diet is bland all day long. Da Huiyun's family of four cultivates eight mu of hillside land, with a yield of five dou per mu, which is not enough to maintain their lives. The sideline production in Licida First Village is only three piglets, and thirteen households average one chicken. The village has six women who can weave, but weaving has not been developed, and they still have to buy cloth from outside to make clothes. Although Luotuo Yao Village harvested an average of ten jin of cotton per person this year, the women have not started spinning and no one is organizing it, so the clothing problem still cannot be solved. The reasons for this phenomenon are: first, the farmers suffered from the destruction of the enemy puppets and feudal forces, and their vitality has not yet recovered; second, the mountain land does not produce much, and the farmers cannot solve all their living problems even after obtaining land; third, there are no organizations in the village to organize weaving, transportation and other sideline production; fourth, after the land reform, the cadres left, and did not "strike while the iron is hot" to shift from land reform to various productions; fifth, some cadres are unwilling to go to poor and remote mountain areas and prefer to work in large villages. This serious problem should be solved immediately in various places. (He Wei)

    农民获土地后仍有困难
    应加强领导发展各种生产
    【本报太岳十日电】太岳某些山村，土地改革实现后，农民经济生活尚有许多困难，领导农民进行生产，已成为今后主要问题。阳城李圪瘩第一庄斗倒封建地主达鉴三等，彻底消灭了封建剥削，赤贫已完全获得土地。垣曲骆驼窑村四家赤贫，共二十三口人，获得土地五十八亩，每人平均二亩四分。两村虽已实现耕者有其田，但因土壤多为沙质，又是梯田，产量不高，加以手工业、副业不发达，农民生活仍然贫困，衣被单薄，终日淡食。达辉云家四口人，种坡地八亩，每亩产量五斗，不足维持生活。李圪瘩第一庄的副业只有小猪三口，十三户平均一只鸡，全村有纺织妇女六人也没发展纺织，穿衣还必须从外面买布。骆驼窑村今年虽平均每人收花十斤，妇女也未动手纺也没人组织，穿衣问题仍不能解决。形成这种现象的原因：第一，农民遭受敌伪及封建势力摧残，元气尚未恢复；第二，山地产量不大，农民获得土地仍不能解决全部生活问题；第三，村里尚无组织纺织、运输等副业生产的机构；第四，土地改革以后，干部即离开了，并未“趁热打铁”的从土地改革转入各种生产；第五，有些干部不愿到穷乡僻壤的山地，愿意在大村里工作。这个严重的问题，各地应立即设法解决。（何微）
