Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th—Renowned liberal sociologist Professor Tao Menghe published an article in the Ta Kung Pao on November 20th titled "Tolerance and Mutual Concession," criticizing the Kuomintang government's autocratic dictatorship. Tao stated, "Under autocratic politics, there is only the emperor's decree and no public opinion; there is only government authority, and the people are not allowed to assert their rights. The government only tells the people to be patient, but it is not patient itself, which is why Mr. Wen Yiduo suffered a tragic death, and why no compromise can be found in the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party." Tao said, "Because of intolerance, countless ideas, systems, and people's actions that could benefit the welfare of the nation have been frustrated and destroyed, causing our society to stagnate." "I don't know how many geniuses and talents have been buried, how many precious lives have been lost, and how much vitality for social progress and national development has been destroyed." Finally, Tao warned the Kuomintang government, "But patience is always limited, and when the people reach the stage where they can no longer tolerate or concede, it will lead to change."

  　抨击蒋政府专制独裁
    【新华社延安五日电】著名自由主义社会学家陶孟和教授，十一月二十日在大公报发表“宽容与互让”一文，抨击国民党政府专制独裁。陶氏说：“在独裁政治之下，只有圣旨没有民意，只有政府权威，不许人民伸张权利。政府只叫人民忍耐，而自己不忍耐因此闻一多先生遭受惨死，因此致使国共之争寻不出折衷方案。”陶氏说：“因为不宽容，不知道有多少思想制度，人民的行动可以有益于民族福利的，竟遭挫折毁灭，使我们的社会停滞不进。”“不知淹没了多少奇才异能，断丧了多少可宝贵的生命，摧残了多少社会进步国家发展的生机。”最后陶氏警告国民党政府说：“可是忍耐总是有限度的，到了人民无可再忍无可再让的阶段，就会遭致变动的。”
