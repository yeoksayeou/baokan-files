Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech at the Yan'an All Circles Youth Commemorative Meeting for "December 9th" and "December 1st," entitled "Everyone Actively Works to Realize the Political Consultative Conference Line and the January Truce Order." The abstract is as follows:

　　The speech first pointed out that the Chinese nation is still not liberated, and Chiang Kai-shek has sold China to American imperialists. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty is a bill of sale for the Chinese people, even more severe than the Twenty-One Demands. Continuing: Chiang Kai-shek is expanding the civil war, seizing grain and conscripting soldiers from the people nationwide. The Chinese people have tested twice to achieve independence, peace, and democracy, namely the Double Tenth Agreement and the January Truce Order and the Political Consultative Conference, but they were all destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek! We have also tested the US government's policy towards China twice: Hurley and Wedemeyer were one, and Marshall was another. Marshall signed three documents on behalf of the US government in the January Truce Agreement, the February Military Reorganization Plan, and the March Northeast Truce Agreement. We thought the US government would keep its word, but unfortunately, this idea proved to be wrong! He then stated: Chiang Kai-shek's convening of the so-called "National Assembly" completely turned the Double Tenth Agreement, the January Truce Order, and the Political Consultative Conference resolutions into waste paper, canceling the Chinese people's hope of achieving independence and democracy through peaceful consultation. Unless Chiang Kai-shek immediately dissolves this illegal "National Assembly" and restores the army to its position on January 13, there will be no basis for negotiation. At this point, he said: American imperialists want to turn China into a colony. Chiang Kai-shek's policy is national betrayal, civil war, and dictatorship. Since Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of American imperialists, has torn up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the January Truce Order, the task of the people and youth of the whole country is to realize the Political Consultative Conference line and the January Truce Order by their own efforts, and to realize China's independence, peace, and democracy.

　　He then said: In the past five months, the People's Liberation Army has eliminated one-fifth of Chiang Kai-shek's invading army. The second battlefield behind Chiang's army—the popular uprisings in the provinces under Chiang's control—has also developed widely. Chiang Kai-shek has two major weaknesses in military affairs: insufficient troops and soldiers' war-weariness. Chiang Kai-shek may still launch offensives in several areas in the future, and even vainly attempt to attack Yan'an. We must be vigilant, but his "general trend is over"! The war has tested the strength of American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek and proved that they are not terrible, proving that the strength of the Chinese people is invincible. Politically, the signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty and the convening of the illegal National Assembly have completely isolated Chiang Kai-shek, and his prestige has been swept away. While convening the "National Assembly," Chiang Kai-shek sent agents to Hong Kong to assassinate Mr. Zhu Xuefan and brutally kill petitioning vendors in Shanghai, further highlighting that this "National Assembly" is the "pig parliament" of the dictator Chiang Kai-shek. However, the level of awareness of the Chinese people has also rapidly increased. Now the people are beginning to take action themselves to fight for survival. Popular uprisings are breaking out in various rural areas, and in cities like Shanghai, the vendors have largely begun to be unable to endure it any longer.

　　The international situation is also unfavorable to Chiang Kai-shek. The American economic crisis is about to arrive. American imperialists are oppressing and invading all capitalist countries, colonies, and semi-colonies around the world, and attacking the American people. Therefore, the people of all capitalist countries (including the United States) have all turned left. This is manifested in the establishment of new democratic governments in Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe, the progress of Britain and France, the widespread movement for independence and freedom in colonies and semi-colonies, the leftward turn of the people of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the leftward turn and strike movement of the American people, and the development of democratic forces in South America. At the same time, the first year of the socialist Soviet Union's new five-year plan was completed ahead of schedule, and a peaceful and democratic policy achieved victory in diplomacy. The speed of world progress is very fast, and China's independent, peaceful, and democratic movement is by no means isolated. All the reactionaries in the world (including Chiang Kai-shek) rely on American imperialist elements, and they are truly isolated and opposed by the whole world.

　　Finally, he emphasized: Since the door to peaceful consultation has been closed by Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese people cannot do without survival, so they must realize the Political Consultative Conference line and the January Truce Order to realize a new China of independence, peace, and democracy. This goal can only be achieved by the Chinese people and Chinese youth working together. As long as everyone works hard and strives, all hardships and difficulties can be overcome. The cause of the liberation of the Chinese people is bound to be victorious.

　　大家动手为实现政协路线与一月停战令而奋斗
  　陆定一同志在“一二九”“一二一”纪念会上演讲
    【新华社延安七日电】中共中央宣传部长陆定一在延安各界青年纪念“一二九”“一二一”大会上的演说，题为大家动手为实现政协路线与一月停战令而奋斗。摘要如下：
    演说中首先指出目前中华民族还是没有解放，蒋介石已将中国出卖给美国的帝国主义者。蒋美商约就是中国人民的卖身契，比二十一条还厉害。继续：蒋介石扩大内战，向全国人民抢粮抓丁，中国人民为实现独立和平民主，已试验过两次，就是双十公告和一月停战令与政协会议，但都被蒋介石破坏了！美国政府对华政策我们也试验过两次，赫两利、魏德迈是一次，马歇尔又是一次。马歇尔一连在一月停战协定、二月整军方案、三月东北停战协定、代表美国政府签了三个字，我们以为美国政府会守信用，可是这种想法不幸然被证明为错误的了！继又称：蒋介石召开所谓“国大”是把双十公告一月停战令政协决议彻底当成废纸，取消了中国人民以和平协商方法达到独立民主的希望，除非蒋介石立即解散这个非法的“国大”和恢复一月十三日的军队位置，谈判就没有基础了。至此他说：美国的帝国主义者，要把中国变为殖民地。蒋介石的政策是卖国内战，独裁，蒋介石既然在美国的帝国主义者帮助之下，撕毁了政协决议和一月停战令，全国人民、全国青年的任务，就是要自己动手来实现政协路线与一月停战令实现中国的独立和平民主。
    接着他说：五个月来人民解放军消灭蒋介石进犯军的五分之一，蒋军背后的第二战场——蒋管区各省的民变，也有了普遍的开展。蒋介石军事上有两大弱点，就是兵力不足兵心厌战，蒋介石今后还可能在几个地区发动进攻，甚至还妄想进攻延安，我们必须警惕，但他是“大势已去”了！战争测验了美国的帝国主义者和蒋介石的力量并不可怕，证明了中国人民的力量不可战胜。政治上蒋美商约的签订和非法国大的召开，蒋介石就完全孤立，威信扫地。蒋介石一面召开“国大”，一面派特务在香港暗杀朱学范先生，在上海惨杀请愿的摊贩，更显出这个“国大”是独裁者蒋介石的“猪仔国会”。但是中国人民的觉悟程度也很快的提高了，现在人民开始自己动起手来为救死求生而奋斗，农村中各地民变蜂起，城市中如上海摊贩大都已开始不能再忍耐下去了。
    国际形势对蒋介石也是不利，美国的经济危机不久就要到来，美国的帝国主义者压迫和侵略全世界一切资本主义国家、殖民地、半殖民地，并且进攻美国人民。因此一切资本主义国家（连美国在内）人民，就都左倾了，这表现在东欧东南欧各国都建立了新民主主义的政府，英法两国的进步，殖民地、半殖民地各国普遍的争取独立自由的运动，德、意、日三国人民的左倾，美国人民的左倾与罢工运动，南美洲民主力量的发展。同时社会主义苏联新五年计划的第一年计划提早完成，在外交上和平民主政策得到胜利。世界进步的速度是非常之快，中国独立和平民主运动是决不孤立的，全世界的反动派（包括蒋介石在内），统统依靠美国的帝国主义分子，他们才真正是孤立的，是遭到全世界的反对的。
    最后他着重称：和平协商的门既然被蒋介石关闭起来，但中国人民不能不要生存，因而就要实现政协路线，和一月停战令，要实现独立和平民主的新中国。这个目的只有靠中国人民、中国青年大家动手，才能达到。只要大家动手努力奋斗，一切艰苦困难必能克服。中国人民的解放事业，是一定胜利的。
