　　Peking University · Federation of Literary and Art Circles
    Establishes Women's Issues Research Association
    [Report from Peking University] The news of Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to attack Yan'an has aroused universal indignation. The female comrades of Peking University and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles felt the immediate need to organize. They held a general meeting of female comrades at Peking University on the morning of the 24th of last month. More than 100 people attended. President Fan Wenlan, Secretary-General Luo Qing, Dean of Academic Affairs Zhang Baiyuan, Dean of the College of Arts and Education Zhang Zonglin, and directors of various departments were present. At the meeting, President Fan earnestly instructed: "If our 15 million women in this liberated area can all care about the current situation, they will definitely exert a greater force in the revolutionary work. Female comrades have many advantages in carrying out mass work in rural areas and can go deep into the homes of the people... Everyone has a considerable level of culture and political awareness and should do their best to spread the many deeds of women's liberation, women's participation in the war, and production to the whole country and the world..." Secretary-General Luo and Dean Zhang introduced many heroic deeds of women in the old liberated areas during the eight years of the war against Japan, which greatly encouraged everyone. Finally, Dean Zhang Zonglin said: "It is a great happy event that you, a group of intellectual women, have organized. From now on, you will have a very heavy burden on your shoulders. One end of this burden is to serve the masses of women practically, and the other end is to sing praises to the free and beautiful women's lives in our liberated areas at home and abroad..."
    When the meeting turned to discussion, Comrade Zeng Ke of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles proposed: "There is strength in organization. We should establish an organization to serve the masses of women in a planned way and join hands closely with the women of the entire liberated area to fully support the front line!" After discussion, it was named the Peking University Federation of Literary and Art Circles Women's Issues Research Association. Zeng Ke of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Jiang Guoren of the school headquarters, Li Jian, Cai Kangzhi, Qiao Qian of the Medical College, Gong Zhijian of the College of Arts and Education, Chen Xi of the Administrative Yuan, Hu Zihui of the Literary and Art Research Office, and Zeng Zhujun of the School of Engineering and School of Finance and Economics were elected to the organizational executive committee, with Jiang Guoren and Zeng Ke as the director and deputy director, respectively. Divisions will carry out production, organization, propaganda, and research work.
    Finally, the conference unanimously passed a telegram to the Women's Federation of the Yan'an Liberated Area to support the defense of Yan'an, and a telegram to the patriotic women in the Great Rear Area to protest Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of selling out the country and launching a civil war, as well as illegally convening the "National Assembly."

　　北大·文联
    成立妇女问题研究会
    【本报北大讯】蒋贼企图进攻延安的消息传来，人人激愤，北大和文联的女同志，觉得有立即组织起来的必要，当于上月二十四日上午，在北大举行全体女同志大会，到会有一百多人，列席者有范文澜校长、罗青秘书长、张柏园教务长、文教学院张宗麟院长及各院主任等。会上范校长恳切的指示说：“咱们这个解放区一千五百多万妇女，若都能关心当前时局，对于革命工作一定会发挥更大的力量。开展农村群众工作，女同志有很多便利条件，可以深入到老百姓家里……大家都有相当的文化和政治水平，应当尽力量把妇女翻身，妇女参战和生产的许多事迹，广播到全国全世界去……。”罗秘书长和张教务长给大家介绍了很多老解放区妇女，在八年对敌斗争中的英烈事迹，给大家很大的鼓舞。最后张宗麟院长说：“你们这一批知识妇女组织起来，是一桩大喜事，今后诸位肩膀上挑了一付很重的担子，这担子一头是切实为群众妇女服务，另一头是向国外国内歌颂咱们这自由美好的解放区的妇女生活……”。
    会议转入讨论时，文联曾克同志提议说：“组织起来才有力量，我们应该成立一个机构，有计划的去为群众妇女服务，和全解放区的妇女亲密的携起手来，全力支援前线！”经过讨论，定名为北大文联妇女问题研究会，文联曾克、校部姜国仁、李坚、蔡康志、医学院乔迁、文教学院宫志坚、行政院陈西、文艺研究室胡子慧、工学院财经学院曾竹君等九人当选组织执行委员会，姜国仁和曾克为正副主任。分部进行生产，组织，宣传，研究诸项工作。
    最后，大会一致通过致电延安解放区妇联支援保卫延安。致电大后方爱国妇女抗议蒋介石卖国内战及非法召开“国大”等罪行。（绍华、徐省）
