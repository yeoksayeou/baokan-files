　　【This Newspaper, Weixian, 24th】In Guan County's land review and rent reduction campaign, attention has been paid to guiding farmers to pour out their grievances. Last spring, the mass movement leadership in the county did not give clear enough instructions on the policy of encouraging the pouring out of grievances and raising class consciousness. Coupled with the bureaucratic work style of some village cadres, many farmers did not pour out their grievances, and the masses' awareness was not high enough. In this land review and rent reduction campaign, the leadership broke with the perception of some comrades that "the old liberated areas have already gone through last year's mass movement, and farmers no longer have any grievances to pour out," as well as their bureaucratic work style. The grievances of the broad masses have been thoroughly expressed, resulting in an unprecedented increase in class consciousness and a stronger fighting spirit. Experience: First, to ensure that the masses' grievances can be expressed at the reasoning sessions, it is necessary to use various methods to guide them in advance, from individual to collective outpouring of grievances. The more people who pour out their grievances, the more profound the grievances are expressed, and the higher the farmers' class consciousness will be. It is best to have those who have suffered the most first, in order to inspire others who have grievances to pour them out. If village cadres, representatives, and activists are themselves victims of exploitation, they should be good at using their own grievances to inspire others.

　　冠县查减中注意启发农民倒苦水
    【本报威县廿四日电】冠县查减中，注意了启发农民倒苦水。该县去春的群运领导上对启发倒苦水，提高阶级觉悟的方针，指示不够明确，加上有些村干部包办作风，许多农民的苦水没有倒出来，群众觉悟不够高，在这次查减中，领导上打破了某些同志“老区经过去年的群众运动，农民已经没有什么苦水可倒”的认识及包办作风，广大群众的苦水得到彻底的倾诉，因之阶级觉悟空前提高，斗争勇气越盛。经验：第一要使群众的苦水能在讲理会上倾诉，必须预先用各种方式进行诱导，由个别倒到集体倒苦水，倒苦水的人越多，苦水倒得越深刻，农民阶级觉悟越会提高，最好是先叫那些受苦最重的苦主倒，以便启发别的有苦水的人倒。村干部、代表、积极分子如系苦主，就应当善于用自己的苦水去启发别人。
