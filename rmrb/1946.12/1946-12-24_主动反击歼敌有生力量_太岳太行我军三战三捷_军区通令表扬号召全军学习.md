　　Proactively Counterattacking and Annihilating Enemy Forces
    Taiyue and Taihang Our Army Achieves Three Victories in Three Battles
    Military Region Issues Circular Commending and Calling on the Entire Army to Learn
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] A unit of our Taiyue Eighth Route Army, on the 5th and 6th, captured Yuanqu City on the north bank of the Yellow River in one fell swoop, annihilating two battalions of the 163rd Regiment of the Chiang Army's 38th Division. On the 11th, our Taihang Army recovered important strongholds such as Loulou, west of Tangyin City, wiping out five and a half companies of Sun Dianying's troops. By the 15th, the Taiyue and Taihang Armies had also recovered Jiyuan City, a major town in northern Henan, annihilating one company of the Chiang Army's 55th Division and two squadrons of the Jiyuan Security Regiment. The above three battles were concrete manifestations of resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's guiding ideology of concentrating superior forces in a timely manner to eliminate enemy's strength and the call of the Liberation Daily to "resolutely counterattack in places where counter-offensive is possible." To this end, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region has issued a special circular to commend and call on the troops in the entire region to learn and promote this tactic of being good at concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy's strength, being good at finding the enemy's weaknesses, and proactively implementing counterattacks, so as to win greater victories in the patriotic self-defense war.

　　主动反击歼敌有生力量
    太岳太行我军三战三捷
    军区通令表扬号召全军学习
    【本报特讯】我太岳八路军一部，于五六两日，一举攻克黄河北岸的垣曲城，歼蒋军卅八师一六三团两个营。十一日，太行我军收复汤阴城西鹿楼等重要据点，歼俘孙殿英部五个半连；至十五日，太岳、太行我军又将豫北重镇的济源城收复，歼蒋军五十五师一个连及济源保安团两个中队。以上三个战斗，都是坚决执行了毛主席适时集中优势兵力，消灭敌人有生力量的指导思想及解放日报所提出的“在可以反攻的地方坚决反攻”的号召的具体表现。为此，晋冀鲁豫军区特通令嘉奖，并号召全区部队学习，发扬此种善于集中优势兵力歼灭敌人有生力量，善于寻找敌人弱点，主动实行反击的战法，以争取爱国自卫战争的更大胜利。
