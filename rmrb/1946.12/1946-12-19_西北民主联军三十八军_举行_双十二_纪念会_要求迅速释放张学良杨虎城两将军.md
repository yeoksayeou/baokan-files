　　Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army
    Holds "Double Twelfth" Commemoration Meeting
    Demanding the Prompt Release of Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng
    [This Newspaper Special Dispatch] The 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army held a meeting on the 15th of this month at the army's station to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the "Double Twelfth" Incident and a joint army-civilian celebration. The army's commander, Kong Congzhou, deputy commanders Liu Weicheng, and many other cadres were direct participants in the Xi'an Incident. However, for ten years, under Chiang Kai-shek's humiliation, they had never publicly commemorated that heroic feat of the past. This year, they publicly commemorated it for the first time in the liberated areas, and everyone was in high spirits, recounting their brave deeds of the past.
    The venue was in a square outside the village, plastered with slogans everywhere. On both sides of the rostrum were couplets that read, "Uphold the spirit of the Xi'an Incident to oppose the civil war! Bring out the iron will of the people to defeat the Chiang army!"
    Around ten o'clock in the morning, the army's troops and the masses arrived at the venue one after another. First, the local people's theater troupe performed Yangko dances, land boat dances, martial arts, and a "Double Twelfth" living newspaper. The meeting began at twelve o'clock. Commander Kong gave a speech first, recounting the course of the Xi'an Incident, and then said: "After nine years of the War of Resistance to the present, why is Chiang Kai-shek going back to the old path of ten years ago, practicing treason, dictatorship, and fighting internal wars? Because he was forced to resist Japan, but his opposition to communism and the people has always remained unchanged, whether openly or secretly. Therefore, after Japan surrendered, since he obtained the support of American imperialism, he sold out sovereignty in exchange for capital and implemented civil war and dictatorship. We believe that history will not go backwards, and those who are enemies of the people will surely be overwhelmed by the power of the people! Chiang Kai-shek has broken his promise and placed Generals Zhang and Yang under house arrest one after another, and it has been ten years now! He refused to release them during the War of Resistance because they were active anti-Japanese elements; after Japan surrendered, all parties appealed for their release, but he still refused because they were enthusiastic about democracy; now he is even less willing to release them because the two of them are heroes against the civil war; Chiang Kai-shek has placed one Yang Hucheng and one Zhang Xueliang under house arrest, but thousands of Yang Huchengs and Zhang Xueliangs are continuing to rise up!"
    Then, Minister Ren Baige of the military region and Director Yuan of the Border Region Government's Department of Civil Affairs spoke, praising the historical significance of the Xi'an Incident and the heroism of the Northwest Army, and strongly condemning Chiang Kai-shek. The masses were enthusiastic, and the army and the people shouted in unison, opposing Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, treason, and dictatorship, stirring up people's indignation!
    [Another Dispatch] The 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army specially issued a circular telegram to commemorate the "Double Twelfth," demanding the prompt release of Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, and appealing to the patriotic and home-loving generals of the Northwest to follow the heroic example of Hu Jingduo, commander of the 6th Cavalry Division of the Allied Army, in the Yulin Uprising, and quickly lead their troops to revolt and work together to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship and civil war. It also tells the elders, brothers, sisters, and siblings of the Northwest to unite with the local people's armed forces, expand armed struggle and all struggles against grain and conscription, strike at the Hu army, exhaust the Hu army, and let it be eliminated in the offensive against Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia!

　　西北民主联军三十八军
    举行“双十二”纪念会
    要求迅速释放张学良杨虎城两将军
    【本报特讯】西北民主联军第三十八军，本月十五日在该军驻地举行纪念“双十二”十周年暨军民联欢大会。该军孔军长从周、刘副军长威诚和许多干部，都是西安事变的直接参加者，但是十年来他们在蒋介石的屈辱下，对于他们过去那一幕壮举，不曾公开纪念过。今年在解放区首次公开纪念，个个精神振奋，互相述说着以往壮勇的事迹。
    会场在村外广场上，到处贴遍标语，主席台两旁贴着“一本西安兵谏精神反对内战！拿出人民铁石力量击败蒋军！”的对联。
    上午十时左右，该军部队和群众，先后到场。首由地方人民剧团表演秧歌、旱船、武术、“双十二”活报。十二时开会，首由孔军长演说，他讲了西安事变的经过之后，接着说：“经过九年抗战到现在，为什么蒋介石又走回十年以前的旧路，实行卖国、独裁和打内仗呢？因为他对抗战是被逼的，反共反人民，却是或明或暗始终不变的。所以在日本投降以后，既然得到美帝国主义的支持，便出卖主权换得资本，实行内战和独裁了。我们相信历史是不会走回头路的，与人民为敌的，一定要被人民的力量压倒！蒋介石背弃诺言，把张杨二将军先后实行软禁，到现在也整十年了！抗战时不肯释放，因为他们是抗日积极分子；日本投降后，各方呼吁仍不释放，因为他们热心民主；现在更不肯释放了，因为他两位正是反内战的英雄；蒋介石软禁了一个杨虎城和一个张学良，正有千百个杨虎城张学良继续起来！”
    继请军区任部长白戈、边府民厅袁厅长讲话，对西安事变历史意义及西北军的英勇多所赞扬，对蒋介石痛加责斥，群众情绪热烈，军民同声高呼，反对蒋介石内战卖国独裁的声浪，激动了人们义愤的心情！
    【又讯】西北民主联军第卅八军为纪念“双十二”特发表通电，要求赶快释放张学良杨虎城两将军，并吁请西北爱国爱乡的将领效法该联军骑兵第六师胡景铎师长在榆林起义的英勇榜样，赶快率部起义，为反对蒋介石独裁内战共同效力。并告西北父老兄弟姊妹，要和地方上的人民武装团结起来，扩大武装斗争及抗粮抗丁一切斗争，打击胡军，枯竭胡军，叫它在进攻陕甘宁的作战中，归于消灭！
