People Rising from the Bloodbath
　　A Letter Filled with Blood and Tears Vowing to Resist Chiang Kai-shek and Avenge Father's Death

　　My friend Hu Tianlu, from Huguan Village in Heze, recently sent me a letter. He led the masses to stand up and overthrow the landlords this February and was elected as the chairman of the farmers' association. This time, when Chiang's army occupied Heze, I was worried about him. Suddenly, I received his letter and hurriedly opened it, which filled me with grief and indignation. The letter said:

　　“This spring, I was allocated over ten mu of land and twenty thousand yuan. My family of three, besides farming, also made a small profit selling cigarettes. Life was getting better every day. Through the introduction of Aunt Wang from Nanzhuang, I got engaged to a girl surnamed Wang from Dongzhuang. She is eighteen years old now, studying in a senior elementary school, and her grades are very good. She is also quite pretty. You can imagine how happy I was! Who knew that disaster would strike, turning my happy marriage into ‘fetching water with a bamboo basket.’

　　On the wedding day, the drums and music were deafening, and it was very lively. The masses came to congratulate us. Long-burning lamps were lit in the evening, filling the room with a red glow. We sat facing each other, talking about our experiences of standing up and how we would spend our time in the future. Later, when we talked about the Chiang army's intrusion, she said that her family had urged her to get married because they heard that Chiang's bandits were attacking. Otherwise, she would have studied for a few more years. We were talking and laughing, and the night was already late. Suddenly, we heard chaos in the street. My elderly father whispered at the window, ‘Chiang's army is here!’ I jumped up and ran outside with a grenade, wanting to kill a few enemies. My father hurriedly stopped me and said, ‘Light cannot withstand heavy, and weak cannot withstand strong. How many can you kill alone? It is better to hide temporarily in the cellar, and after the enemy leaves, organize the people to fight them.’ I felt that my father was right, so I hid in the cellar. My wife carefully covered the cellar opening with weeds. Amidst the constant gunfire and shouting, there was a bang, and the door of my house was kicked open. Seven or eight Chiang soldiers pointed their guns at my parents, ransacking the place, saying they were looking for the Eighth Route Army. The two old people were so scared that they couldn't speak, just staring blankly. The bandits stuffed things into their pockets, took things away, and finally, my wife was dragged out of bed. They teased her, saying, ‘This woman is really good-looking, quickly send her as a gift to our company commander!’ They pushed and pulled her, crowding around her as they walked out. My mother was so frightened that she didn't dare to move. My father mustered his courage and pulled her back, but the bandits hit him hard with their rifle butts. Hearing his daughter-in-law's cries, my father followed them, but not far from the gate, he was shot dead. In the cellar, I felt like I was being stabbed by ten thousand knives. Hearing my father's ‘aiya’ sound, I knew he must have been killed. Unable to bear it any longer in the cellar, I jumped out of the cellar, found a shovel in the thatched hut, and went out and chopped down three enemies. I ran out of the village, covered in blood, and ran to my father-in-law's house in Dongzhuang and changed my clothes. When they heard that their daughter had been kidnapped by the Chiang army, the whole family cried. I couldn't sit or lie down for most of the night, pacing anxiously in the room. When dawn broke, people on the road said that the Chiang army had left. Only then did I and my in-laws rush back to my village. The fire set by the Chiang army was still burning, and no one cared to put it out. All the young and middle-aged men in the village had been captured, leaving only the old and weak. Some were crying for their sons, some for their fathers, and some were cursing. When I arrived at my house, I saw my father still lying in the pool of blood, and I couldn't help but cry. My village is on a main road, and I was afraid that the enemy would come again, so I quickly found a mat, wrapped my father in it, and brought him into the house. In the chaos, I suddenly realized that I hadn't seen my mother for most of the day. When I looked in the house, she was lying stiffly on the bed. Feeling her body, she was still a little warm. Everyone worked together to get her breathing again. After waking up, she just looked around blankly, tears streaming down her face, unable to say a word. I asked the neighbors if they had seen my wife, but they all said they hadn't, only hearing a woman's cries when the bandits left. I had no choice but to find a small cart, put my mother on it, bid farewell to the neighbors, and everyone encouraged each other: ‘Don't be too sad.’ I said, ‘After I send my mother to my mother's house to find a place to settle down, I will come back and avenge with everyone.’ The villagers sent us off a long way, some saying: ‘You led us to stand up and overthrow the landlords, and you must also lead us to avenge and beat Chiang Kai-shek, the dog!’ I told them to go back, but they wouldn't stop. When we parted, some cried bitterly. When I could barely see them, I saw them still standing there, my heart was cut like a knife.

　　While pushing the cart, I thought to myself, the hatred of killing my father and robbing my wife, the raging anger, was about to explode. Confused, I arrived at my uncle's house. My aunt came out to greet my mother, acting like a fool. After clarifying the reason, she also cried bitterly. My uncle comforted me, saying: ‘Child, don't worry, your mother will not have to worry about food and clothing in my house. You must have ambition and go to avenge!’

　　After that, I worked day and night, connecting everywhere. In less than four or five days, I gathered several hundred good men who were rising up to protect their homes. We shouldered our weapons and attacked everywhere behind the Chiang army, determined to eliminate this group of beasts. Heze will eventually belong to us...’."

　　As I read the letter, I shed tears, and finished it in one breath, my blood already boiling throughout my body.

### 血泊中站起来的人们　满纸血泪一封书誓抗蒋贼报父仇

　　血泊中站起来的人们
  　满纸血泪一封书誓抗蒋贼报父仇
    亮
    我的朋友胡天禄，最近寄给我一封信，他是荷泽胡官庄人，今年二月领导群众翻身，被选为农会主任。这次蒋军攻占荷泽，我正在惦念着他，忽接来信，急忙拆开阅读，使我悲愤填膺。来信说：
    “今春我分了十来亩地，两万块钱，我一家三口，除种地外，零卖个纸烟，生活一天比一天好起来。经南庄王大娘的介绍，与东庄姓王的闺女订了婚，她现在十八岁了，在高小读书，功课很好，人才也不丑，你想我是多么的欢喜呢！那知灾祸临头，竟使我的美满婚姻成了“竹篮子打水”。
    在娶亲那天，鼓乐喧天，热闹非常，群众都来贺喜，晚上燃起长明灯，满屋照的红亮，俺俩对面坐着，谈起翻身经过和今后怎样过时光。后来说到蒋军的窜扰，她说她家里是因为听到蒋贼进攻才催着过了门，若不然还得再读几年书。说说笑笑，夜已很深了，猛听见街里乱起来，年老的父亲在窗前低声的说：“蒋军来了！”我猛然起身，拿手榴弹就往外跑，想杀几个敌人。父亲急忙拉住我说：“轻不抵重，弱不抵强，你一个人能杀几个？不如暂藏在窖子里，等敌人走了，组织民众，和他大干”。我觉得父亲说得也对，就躲在窖子里，我的妻子还小心的用乱草把窖口盖好。在不住的乱枪、呼喊声中，砰的一声，把我家的大门弄开了，七八个蒋军用枪对准我的爹娘，翻箱倒柜，说是找八路，两位老人吓的说不上话来，只是呆呆的看着。匪军们掖的掖、拿的拿，最后我妻子被从床上拉出来，他们戏弄着说：“这女人长的真不错，赶快给咱连长送个礼吧”！就连推带拉，拥着她往外走。我母亲骇的不敢动了，父亲壮了壮胆，在后面拉住，匪军用枪托子狠狠的打他，父亲听着儿媳哭声，就又跟下去，才出大门不远，一枪被他们打死，我在窖子里有如万刀绞心，听见父亲哎呀一声，想必父亲已被打死，在窖里再难忍耐下去，我便跳出窖子，到草屋摸了个锹，出门砍倒了三个敌人。跑出村去，那时我弄的满身是血，跑到东庄丈人家，换了衣裳。他们听到女儿被蒋军抢去，全家大哭起来，大半夜我不能坐卧，急的只在屋子里乱转，等到天明，路上行人都说蒋军走了，才和亲家一气跑到俺村。蒋军放的火仍在燃烧着，也没人顾得去救，村里青壮年全被抓走了，光剩下老弱。有的哭儿，有的哭爹，有的叫骂。到了家门，见父亲仍躺在血泊中，我也禁不住大哭起来。我村是来往大道，又怕敌人再来，赶快找了领席，把父亲卷好，进了家里，慌乱中才忽然想起怎么大半天没见母亲，到屋一看，她老人家已直挺挺的躺在炕上。摸摸身上还有点热气，大家齐下手把她抉过气来。醒过来后，她光四下里乱看，眼泪直流，说不出一句话。我问街坊见我妻子没有，都说没见，只听到匪军走时，有女人的哭声。我没办法，找了辆小车，叫母亲坐在上面，告别了邻居，大家互相劝勉着：“不要过分难受。”我说：“等我把母亲送到老娘家去，找个安身地方，我回来和大家一块报仇”。乡亲们送出老远，有的说：“你领导俺翻了身，也得领导俺报仇，打蒋介石狗日的。”我叫他们回去，他们总是不肯停住脚步，当我们分手时，有的痛哭起来。快看不见了，见他们还站在那里，我心如刀割。
    一面推着小车，我心里想，杀父之仇，夺妻之恨，熊熊的怒火，都要爆炸了，糊里糊涂的走到舅父家门，舅娘出来接见我母亲，象傻子一样，问清根由，也大哭起来。舅父安慰我说：“孩子，你放心，你娘在我家吃穿不用愁，你要长志气，去报仇啊”！
    以后我遂不分昼夜，各处串连，不到四五天，就集合了好几百奋起保家的好男儿，我们扛起了武器，在蒋军后方到处袭击，坚决消灭这群野兽，荷泽终久是属于我们的………”。
    我一面看信，一面流泪，一气把它读完，热血已在全身沸腾。
