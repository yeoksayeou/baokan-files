　　Establishing "Merit Books"
    Anyang's 350,000 Military Personnel, Government Officials, and Civilians Launch Merit Campaign
    [Our newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 12th] Under the slogan of defending homes and fields and taking revenge by earning merit, 350,000 people, cadres, armed work team members, guerrillas, and militia members in Anyang have launched a merit campaign. All district and village offices and military units have established "Merit Books" with clear systems of reward and punishment. The county government has also issued a proclamation stating that even those who previously served as Chiang's army soldiers or personnel of the puppet regime will now be rewarded for their merits and punished for their offenses, with merits offsetting crimes. This movement is now in full swing. In the past ten days, more than a dozen models of merit, such as Lü Bingquan, have emerged. On the night of November 28th, Comrade Lü Bingquan led militiamen Song Chunze, Yang Yusheng, and others in a surprise attack on the North Gate of Shuiye, capturing special agent landlord Yang Chunfang alive. After posting the proclamations of our democratic government on the main street of the North Gate, news spread, and Ji Guangli, Wang Jinxue, and several others from the first assault team in the district immediately rose up to compete with Lü Bingquan. On the evening of the 30th, they sneaked into the West Gate of Shuiye and captured the mother of a special agent captain alive. They also colluded with residents ×× to hold a small meeting, secretly propagandizing the victory news and the truth that our army will surely win and Chiang's army will surely be defeated, and urged them to collude with relatives and friends to wait to cooperate with our army's counterattack. On the 2nd, Wang Jinxue, Zhang Deyi, and others attacked the South Gate of Shuiye and captured reactionary landlord Li Qiaolian alive. Then, on the 3rd, militia platoon leader Shen Liangzhu and more than a dozen militiamen including Ji Guangli and Hou Quanze attacked the West Gate and South Gate again in broad daylight. When the South Gate blockhouse guards discovered them, they joined the enemy on the city wall and fired machine guns at us for about an hour, causing chaos in the city, with rumors spreading that "the Eighth Route Army is here." The civilians digging trenches took the opportunity to escape, and our militia temporarily retreated. After the enemy stopped firing, they sneaked back into the West Gate, wounding a Chiang puppet soldier who was escorting civilians to repair the city, posting proclamations, and shouting propaganda, scaring the enemy into closing the city gates and not daring to come out. The militiamen led by Liu Bingzi and Guo Migui in the Sixth District, after penetrating deep into the rear of Chiang's army, charged and rampaged, launching surprise attacks in several places in one night, sweeping away the "Homecoming Corps." On the night of the 30th, they rushed into Shijian, and because the guards hid, they turned their attack to Shiguant and Xugua. The enemy fled upon hearing the news. We then returned to attack Shijian again, finally capturing Guo Da, an officer of the "Homecoming Corps," and burning down a blockhouse. On the night of the 3rd, Guo, Liu, and four other militiamen attacked the Shijian "Homecoming Corps" again, sweeping away Jiadian, and burned the Shiguan岗楼 blockhouse on their way back. Under the active operations of our militia, the Chiang puppets were frightened several times a night, unable to sit or sleep in peace. The bad elements who sided with the puppets hid and dared not show their faces. Now, guerrilla warfare is being carried out in the rear of Chiang's army, transforming the situation of the struggle between the enemy and us, earning merit for the people, and achieving remarkable results. The county government has issued circulars of commendation and called on all cadres and militiamen in the county to learn from them.

　　建立“功劳簿”
    安阳卅五万军政民展开立功运动
    【本报长治十二日电】在保家保田复仇立功的口号下，安阳三十五万人民、干部、武工队员游击队员及民兵，展开立功运动。各区村机关、部队均已建立“功劳簿”，严明赏罚制度。县府并布告即使过去曾充任蒋军士兵或伪政权人员等，现在亦当有功必赏，有过必罚，以功折罪。现这一运动，已热烈展开。旬月以来即涌现了立功模范吕炳全等十数人。上月二十八日夜，吕炳全同志带领民兵宋春则、杨玉生等数人，奔袭水冶北关，活捉住特务地主杨春芳。将我民主政府布告张贴北关大街，消息传出后，该区突击一分队姬光礼、王进学等数人即起而和吕炳全比赛高低，于三十日晚潜入水冶西关活捉特务队长之母亲。并串通居民××人举行小型会议，秘密宣传胜利消息及我军必胜蒋军必败的道理，并叮嘱他们串通亲友等待配合我军反攻。二日王进学、张德义等数人，又袭入水冶南关，活捉反动地主李巧连。接着三日民兵中队长申良柱及姬光礼、侯全则等民兵十数人，再次昼袭西关南关。当南关炮楼守卫发觉后，曾联合城上敌人以机枪向我四射约一小时，城内秩序一时大乱，纷传“八路军来了”，挖沟民夫趁机逃散，我民兵暂避。该敌停止射击后，复潜入西关，击伤押解民夫修城之蒋伪一名，张贴布告，喊话宣传，吓得敌人紧闭城门，不敢出来。六区刘炳子、郭米贵带领下之民兵，深入蒋军后方后，横冲直闯，一夜速袭数处，横扫“还乡团”。三十日夜冲入石涧，因守卫藏匿，复又转锋突袭石棺、许挂，敌闻风逃窜。我乃返回再袭石涧，终将“还乡队”办事员郭大捕获，并焚毁炮楼一座。三日夜郭、刘等民兵四人再袭石涧“还乡团”，扫荡贾店，归途中再焚石棺岗楼，在我民兵积极活动下，蒋伪一夕数惊，坐卧不安。附伪坏蛋，均隐匿不敢露面。现蒋军后方正开展游击战争，转变敌我斗争形势，为民立功，成绩卓著。县政府均已分别通报表扬，并号召全县干部民兵向他们看齐。
