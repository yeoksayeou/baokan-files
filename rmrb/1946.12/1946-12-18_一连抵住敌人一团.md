　　One Company Holds Off an Enemy Regiment
　　Ding Man
　　At dawn on the 5th of this month, a regiment of the American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army attacked our Xiao Village and Mao Gang areas from Hushanzhai (north of the Pu-Hua Highway). Its advance troops, two companies, were killed by us, suffering over twenty casualties, and then retreated to Li Village. At 1:00 PM, Chiang's troops again advanced southwest from Li Village with two companies. When the enemy advanced to within a hundred meters, Peng Liancheng, our top sharpshooter, shot down an enemy with the first shot. The advancing enemies were shot down one after another. Liu Tianzhi, the deputy reconnaissance squad leader, also shot down an enemy holding a machine gun with one shot. Our hidden battle on the slope was very lively. Next to a dead body lay an American gun, shining brightly in the sunlight. Two American-made planes circled overhead. The enemy used grenade launchers to indicate targets, and the Chiang's planes fired several bursts of gunfire, dropping two bombs that landed in their own positions. The brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Army watched the spectacle from the bunkers while firing potshots. Squad Leader Jiao Lianpu hit eight, Platoon Leader Zhang Wangui hit five, Peng Liancheng hit three... The enemy panicked and had to use smoke bombs to cover the dragging of the corpses. Our soldiers shouted, "Don't even let him carry the dead bodies away!" An American-equipped regiment of Chiang's army was held back by our one company, suffering more than a hundred casualties, advancing six li and then retreating two li.

　　一连抵住敌人一团
    丁曼
    本月五日拂晓，美械蒋军第五军一个团，从胡山寨（濮滑公路北）向我肖寨、毛岗等地进攻，其先头部队两个连被我击毙二十余人，旋即退至李庄。下午一时，蒋军又以两连兵力，自李庄向西南进犯，待敌进至百米达距离时，我特等射手彭连成第一枪打倒了一个敌人，跃进的敌人又接二连三的被打倒了，一个手持机枪前进的敌人，也被我侦察副班长刘天职一枪打倒了。我坡头隐蔽战斗打得很热闹。一个死尸傍边斜放着一支美国枪，在阳光里闪耀发光，两架美制飞机在头上转，敌人用榴弹炮指示目标，蒋机打了几梭子枪，丢的两颗炸弹都落在了他们自己的阵地里，人民解放军的勇士们在掩体里一面看热闹，一面打冷枪，四班长焦连葡打中了八个，排长张万桂打中了五个，彭连成打中了三个……敌人慌乱起来了，只好以烟幕弹掩护拖死尸，我们战士们喊叫着说：“死尸也不叫他抬下去”。美械蒋军一个团就在我一个连的阻击下，伤亡百余人，前进六里又后退了二里。
