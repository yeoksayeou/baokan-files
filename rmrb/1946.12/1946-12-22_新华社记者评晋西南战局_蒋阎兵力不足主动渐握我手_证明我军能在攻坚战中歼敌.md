Xinhua News Agency, Lvliang Front, 19th: A reporter from this agency commented on the current situation in the Jin-Southwest battle, saying: Just as Chiang Kai-shek was mobilizing a large army to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, Yan Xishan ordered Yang Cheng-yuan, the commander-in-chief of his Jinxi region, to lead his troops to harass more than a hundred villages and towns in the liberated areas sixty miles west of Shilou, starting on November 4, attempting to "suppress" the Eighth Route Army in the area and threaten the eastern side of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia. To this end, the Lvliang Eighth Route Army rose up in self-defense and counterattacked. From November 20th to December 12th, in more than ten days, they successively liberated seven county towns including Yonghe, Daning, Xi County, Shilou, Pu County, Fenxi, Zhongyang, and more than 30 important towns, capturing alive Yan Jun's Jinxi region Commander-in-Chief Yang Cheng-yuan, Major General Chief of Staff Hu Fenzhen, 45th Division Deputy Commander Zhang Juqian, Eighth Administrative District Commissioner Sun Haicheng, "Comrades Association" Branch Director Duan Shutian, and more than 5,200 other officers, soldiers, and administrative personnel. In the vast area stretching more than 400 miles from Zhongyang in the north to the suburbs of Ji County in the south, from the Yellow River in the west to the Tongpu Railway in the east, the pseudo-Yan forces were eliminated, liberating hundreds of thousands of people under the "soldier-peasant unity" tyranny.

This victory first extended the connection between the eastern border of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, and at the same time completely integrated the Jin-Southwest Liberated Area (the Ninth Sub-district of Lvliang) with the interior of Jin-Sui, further forcing the Chiang and Yan troops to retreat to isolated strongholds in the Jinzhong Plain and the narrow area along the Tongpu Railway, creating a more favorable new situation for the Shanxi self-defense war.

This proves that the Eighth Route Army is not only good at annihilating the enemy in mobile warfare, but also can annihilate the enemy in fortified attacks. Xi County, where Yan Xishan painstakingly built more than 60 brick and stone bunkers, hundreds of earthen bunkers, and more than 20,000 meters of trenches over five or six years, was destroyed in less than three days under the Eighth Route Army's fierce attack, which is ironclad proof.

This victory also proves that, due to the insufficient number of Chiang and Yan troops in Shanxi, the initiative in the war has gradually been grasped by the Eighth Route Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Lvliang, 18th: In the battle of the Eighth Route Army to liberate Zhongyang, Yan Xishan cut flesh to heal sores, drawing parts of the 44th, 45th, and 71st Divisions, totaling about 4,000 men, from the Pingyao-Jiexiu area, led by Gao Zhuozi, commander of the 73rd Division, to advance westward along the Fenxiao Highway in an attempt to relieve the siege of Zhongyang. On the 6th, the southern Yan army advanced to Dui Jiuyu (on the Xiaoxi Highway), Shixia (60 miles west of Fenyang City), and the East and West Wujiabao line on Zhongyang Avenue. A part of the 70th Division of the Fenyang Yan army, about 1,300 men, also advanced along the Fen (yang)-Li (shi) Highway to Nanpianchi and Wangjiachi (50-60 miles northwest of Fenyang City). The two-way reinforcement army, intimidated by the power of the Eighth Route Army, did not dare to advance lightly. On the 11th, its vanguard began to advance to Nandajing Village, more than 60 miles north of Zhongyang City. That night, the Eighth Route Army entered Zhongyang City, and the Yan army fled back to Fenyang Xiaoyi the next day in panic.

　　新华社记者评晋西南战局
    蒋阎兵力不足主动渐握我手
    证明我军能在攻坚战中歼敌
    【新华社吕梁前线十九日电】本社记者对目前晋西南战局发表评论称：正当蒋介石调集大军准备进攻陕甘宁边区之际，阎锡山令其晋西地区总指挥杨澄源率部于十一月四日开始向石楼以西六十里之解放区百余村镇扰犯，妄图“肃清”该地八路军，威胁陕甘宁东侧。为此，吕梁八路军乃奋起自卫反击，从十一月二十日至十二月十二日，十余天来，连续解放永和、大宁、隰县、石楼、蒲县、汾西、中阳等七座县城及重镇三十余处，生俘阎军晋西地区上将总指挥杨澄源、少将参谋长胡芬珍、四十五师副师长张居乾、八行政区专员孙海丞、“同志会”分会主任段书田以下官兵及行政人员五千二百余人。在北起中阳，南至吉县城郊，西至黄河，东至同蒲线，长达四百余里宽约三百里的广大地区中，肃清了阎伪势力，使“兵农合一”暴政下数十余万人民获得解放。
    这一胜利，首先使陕甘宁边区之东境与晋绥解放区联系面延长，同时使晋西南解放区（吕梁之九分区）与晋绥内地完全打成一片，进而逼使蒋阎军只得退据晋中平川的孤立据点及同浦沿线的狭窄地带，造成了山西自卫战争更有利的新的形势。
    这证明八路军不仅善于从运动战中消灭敌人，而且也能在攻坚战中消灭敌人。阎锡山苦心修筑五六年，有六十余座砖石碉堡、数百个土碉堡、两万多公尺壕沟工事的隰县城，在八路军的猛击下，不到三天即遭毁灭，即其铁证。
    这一胜利同样证明了，由于蒋阎在山西兵力不足，战争主动权已逐渐为八路军所掌握。
    【新华社吕梁十八日电】八路军解放中阳之役，阎锡山剜肉补疮，从平遥介休地区抽调第四四、第四五、第七一，三个师各一部，约四千余人，由七三师师长高卓资统率，沿汾孝公路西进，图解中阳之围。六日南路阎军进至兑九峪（孝隰公路线上）、石匣（汾阳城西六十里）及中阳大道上东西武家堡一线，汾阳阎军七十师一部约一千三百余人亦沿汾（阳）离（石）公路进至南偏池、王家池（汾阳城西北五六十里），该两路援军慑于八路军威力，不敢轻进。十一日其先头部队始进至中阳城北六十余里之南大井村，当晚八路军即进入中阳城，阎军乃于次日仓惶窜回汾阳孝义。
