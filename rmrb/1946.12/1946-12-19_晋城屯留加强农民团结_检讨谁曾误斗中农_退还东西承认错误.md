　　Taiyue, 14th (of the month) (This Newspaper) – At the Jincheng Fourth District's Upside-Down Heroes Conference, everyone deeply reviewed the past mistakes of struggling against middle peasants. One hero said with heartfelt pain: "Before the Communist Party arrived, we poor peasants and middle peasants were like siblings without a mother, suffering exploitation and oppression from landlords and feudal forces. Now, we realize that struggling against middle peasants is harming 'flesh and blood relatives.'" In Hengling Village, Yangcheng, last winter, instigated by landlords, they wrongfully struggled against Gao, a middle peasant who had built his wealth through labor, taking three acres of land and five dan of grain. During the thorough excavation of the roots of poverty struggle, the peasants recognized their mistake, returned everything completely, and from then on strengthened the unity between poor and middle peasants. In Xiwangpo, Tunliu, a village-wide mass meeting was held. At the meeting, the peasants automatically returned the gains from the wrongful struggle against the middle peasants. For example, the grain taken from Liu Mingzhi and Song Liuhai during the struggle was completely returned, and the middle peasants' worries began to be relieved.

　　晋城屯留加强农民团结
    检讨谁曾误斗中农  退还东西承认错误
    【本报太岳十四日电】晋城四区翻身英雄大会上，大家深刻的检讨以往错斗了中农，某英雄痛心的说：“共产党未到以前，咱们贫农与中农如同没娘孩的弟兄一样，受地主封建势力的剥削欺压，如今互相认识了斗争中农即是损害“骨肉之亲”。阳城横岭村，去冬曾被地主挑拨，误斗了劳动起家的中农高三六亩地，五石粮，在彻底挖穷根斗争中农民自认错误，原盘退还，从此加强了贫农与中农的团结。屯留西王坡召开全村群众会议，在会上农民自动退出误斗中农的果实，如刘明志、宋六孩被斗争的粮食全部退还，中农忧虑始被解除。
