"Chiang Kai-shek is like a piece of snow, we are like the sun."
	Heroes Discuss Comrade Li Xuefeng's Report
	For five days, the heroes discussed Comrade Li Xuefeng's report in groups all day long, and gained a deep understanding of the current affairs.
	Wang Shuiwang, a liberated hero from Changzhi, stood up first and said: "After listening to the reports of Chairman Yang and Political Commissar Li, I see that we are bound to win and Chiang Kai-shek is bound to fail. Our team is all composed of soldiers who have been liberated. Everyone is united in moving forward. Chiang Kai-shek's troops are all conscripted, and no one wants to work for him." Bai Majiang, a hero from Yushe, said: "Chiang Kai-shek is like a dog. The dog is lying outside the door, and we have half a brick in our hand. We must always be prepared for him to bite us. He is also like a piece of snow, and we are like the sun. The sun will surely melt him, and we must eliminate him." Ren Sicheng, a hero from Cixian, said: "Chiang Kai-shek's backing is the United States, and our backing is the masses. The power of the masses is more powerful than the firepower of the United States." Sun Shandao, a hero from Wenxian, said: "Chiang Kai-shek's army is like a big steamed bun. We are afraid that we can't eat it in one bite. Now we give him some cities, and when he disperses his troops, we will pick them up piece by piece. He is an acre of wheat, and we are ten acres of threshing ground. We spread his acre of wheat on the ten acres of threshing ground, and then crush it with a roller. We lured him into the city, and we occupied the countryside, just like locking him in solitary confinement, and then dealing with him one by one like catching turtles in a jar."
	The conference shifted to group discussions from the 6th, lasting four days. All the heroes were divided into groups such as militia border areas, militia hinterland, production and self-study, liberated border areas, liberated hinterland, new and old urban areas, old agricultural production areas, new agricultural production areas, textile, cooperation, workers, merchants, and model cadres. The group meetings were very active. At the beginning, some heroes were not humble and looked down on others. For example, when someone else talked about their feelings, they thought it was "nothing," prematurely "questioned," and "picked on faults." On the contrary, when they talked about themselves, they boasted dishonestly. However, some heroes in the new areas had self-deprecating thoughts, feeling "inferior to others," "not good enough," and became discouraged, or panicked and timid. In order to overcome this phenomenon, the comrades of the Organization Department and the team leaders immediately went deep into the heroes, establishing an attitude of "honest reporting and humble learning" for the former, and encouraging the latter more. The militia group preliminarily proposed: "Everyone is a hero, regardless of good or bad, talk boldly and in detail," and everyone was happy. The heroes told their achievements and experiences to their hearts' content, and fully promoted the new heroism. During the discussion, more than 300 people, including the leaders of the Organization Department, the Propaganda Department, the Party, government and army leaders of this region, and guests, attended as observers and took detailed notes.
	The large group discussion began on the 11th, lasting five days. The spokespersons of the large groups were naturally generated from the brewing experience in each small group combined with free registration. It ended on the 15th. The discussion was extremely intense and enthusiastic. Some groups also conducted special problem discussions. For example, the liberated group discussed five issues: ideological mobilization, hiring and mobilizing the poor, uniting the middle peasants, issues of gains, and organizational construction. The cooperation group discussed seven issues: organizational leadership, business lines, the relationship between large and small cooperatives, operating workshops, cooperative system, cooperative system, and cadre issues. The model cadre group discussed the issue of village cadre style. After the large group discussion, the heroes became more prominent, and their achievements and experiences became clearer, truly achieving the goal of exchanging experiences and helping each other learn.

　　“蒋介石好比一块雪，我们好比是太阳”。
    众英雄讨论李雪峰同志报告
    五日众英雄竟日分组讨论李雪峰同志等报告，对目前时事问题有了深刻的认识。
    长治翻身英雄王水旺首先站起来说：“我听了杨主席、李政委的报告后，看到咱们一定要胜利，蒋介石一定要失败。我们的队伍都是翻了身的翻身军。大家一心住前干。蒋介石的队伍都是抓来的，谁也不想给他干。”榆社英雄白马江说：“蒋介石好比一条狗，狗在门外卧，手拿半截砖，我们要时刻防备他来咬我们。他又好比一块雪，我们好比太阳，太阳照着他一定化，我们一定要把他消灭。”磁县英雄任四成说：“蒋介石的后台是美国，我们的后台是群众。群众的力量比他美国的火力还要厉害。”温县英雄孙善道说：“蒋介石队伍是一块大馍馍，我们怕一口咬不了，现在把一些城市让给他，等他把队伍分散开了，我们再一块一块拣着吃。他是一亩麦子，我们是十亩场（打麦场），我们把他一亩麦子铺在十亩场里，然后再拿滚子碾。我们把他引到城里，我们占着乡下，就好像把他关到禁闭室里，然后像瓮中捉龟一样一个一个来收拾。”
    大会从六日起转入小组座谈，前后历时四日。全体英雄划分为民兵边地、民兵腹地、生产自学、翻身边地、翻身腹地、新老区城市、农业生产老区、农业生产新区、纺织、合作、工人、商人、模范干部等组，各组小组会非常活跃，开始时，个别英雄不虚心，瞧不起别人，如人家谈了感觉“没啥”，过早“质问”，“专挑毛病”等，相反的自己谈时吹嘘不老实。但一些新区英雄有自弱思想，感觉“不如人”，“不行啦”而懈气，或心慌胆怯。为克服这种现象，组织部同志与带队同志立即深入英雄，对前者树立“老实报告，虚心学习”的态度，对后者则多加鼓励。民兵组预先即提出：“大家都是英雄，不管好坏，大胆详细谈”，个个都高兴。英雄们尽情的讲出了自己的业迹与经验，充分发扬了新英雄主义。座谈中，大会组织部、宣传部、本区党政军诸首长及来宾三百余人，列席旁听，并大多作了详细笔记。
    十一日开始大组座谈，历时五天。大组发言人，由各小组从酝酿经验中自然产生结合自由报名。至十五日结束。座谈进行极为紧张热烈，有的组还作了专门问题讨论，如翻身组即讨论了思想发动、雇贫发动、团结中农、果实问题、组织建设等五个问题。合作组讨论了组织领导、业务路线、大小合作社关系，经营作坊、社务制度、合作制度、干部问题等七个问题。模范干部组则讨论了村干部作风问题。经过大组座谈，英雄越比越突出，功劳经验越说越明确，真正达到了交流经验互助学习的目的。
