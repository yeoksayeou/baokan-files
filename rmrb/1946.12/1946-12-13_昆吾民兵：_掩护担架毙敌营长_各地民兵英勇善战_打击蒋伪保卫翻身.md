    Kunwu Militia:
    Covering Stretchers, Killing Enemy Battalion Commander
    Militia Across Regions Fight Bravely
    Strike at Chiang's Puppets, Protect the Liberation
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu (冀鲁豫) 11th dispatch] During the Hua County battle, the guerrilla team composed of militia from the Fourth District of Kunwu County escorted stretchers to the front lines. Their morale was high upon departure, with twenty people signing up on the spot. In the end, only sixteen were allowed to go, led by Platoon Leader Comrade Zhang Yunqi. The comrades who remained at home said during the send-off: "Bring back more spoils of war, kill more of those little Chiang Kai-sheks." The second day after arriving at the front lines, they defeated the enemy. Our Fourth District militia were covering the rear in ×× Village when suddenly a company of enemy soldiers rushed towards the village. At this moment, our militia Platoon Leader Comrade Zhang Yunqi calmly commanded, and when the enemy was about to reach the village, they all opened fire, shooting down two enemy soldiers with four shots. The enemy retreated in defeat. Our militia took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing one enemy battalion commander, wounding two enemy soldiers, capturing three alive, and seizing six rifles and over six hundred rounds of ammunition. We suffered no casualties. Our main force cavalry came in pursuit and completely resolved the situation. From then on, the confidence of the militia in the district to defeat Chiang's army was greatly strengthened.
