　　Militia Drills Across the Land

        Taiyue: Combining Border Region Training with Actual Combat

    [Report from Taiyue, 16th of this month] Under the slogan of defending the fruits of land reform, the entire region is universally engaged in large-scale winter military training. In the border areas of Jiang County, Yicheng County, Fushan County, Hongtong County, Huo County, and the heartland areas of Yangcheng County, Jincheng County, Gaoping County, Shimin, and other places, tens of thousands of people are intensely practicing the three major skills (shooting, blasting, grenade throwing). Blasting training, in particular, is being emphasized. In the border region of Jiang County, training extends from the battlefield to the home, with old and young alike making stone mines and installing them. Ling County is using the famous Red Cliff Cave explosion as a learning material, studying it while also practicing near bunkers, thereby greatly increasing confidence. They have formulated a blasting plan, aiming to explode at least one hundred and forty stone mines under the enemy's feet in the fifty days from now until the end of the lunar year. The training in the heartland areas is not lagging behind. When Chen Degui of Tanggou Village, Shimin, received the training notice, it coincided with his wedding. However, Chen Degui was willing to train first and then get married. When others advised him, "Attend the next session!" He said, "No, if I don't train, I won't be able to fight. Who will defend the fruits [of land reform]?" The training method in Shimin involves first having veterans report on their combat experiences, followed by discussions. Merchants in Jincheng city are also rushing to train, mainly practicing stone mine blasting, with frequent field exercises, resulting in excellent results. He Yuansheng's team in Xiguan detonated all five stone mines they practiced with, and their power was great. Yuan Haigen and Yang Guihai in Dongguan have also learned to use machine guns and are skilled in loading and unloading them. In the heartland areas, training is also combined with the struggle for land reform, with daytime struggles followed by nighttime training. Yangcheng's famous combat hero, Night Pearl (Li Yinbao), participated in the battle to recover Yuanqu City after training, annihilating an enemy platoon. After training, the militia of Xiali and Chuanyun in Jincheng swore before the portrait of Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, we have achieved liberation under your leadership, and we will defend the fruits of liberation under your leadership."

            Jinan Rectifies Militia, Launches Learning Competition

    [Report from Weixian, 16th of this month] Qihe, Linqing, Yuanchao, Qinghe and other counties are vigorously developing and rectifying the militia after the completion of the land reform, striking at special agents and preparing for war. During the inspection movement in Yuanchao, thousands of newly liberated peasants poured into the militia ranks. In Luxinzhai Village, Qizhi, the number of militiamen increased from fourteen to thirty-four due to the emphasis on in-depth armed education and self-organized connections among the militia. After the Double Tenth Festival, the Fourth Military Subdistrict transferred militiamen from various counties into nine companies for winter rectification and training. They conducted self-reflection and education by company and launched a learning competition, creating a learning fervor. The Linqing Municipal Military Commission, in order to eliminate corruption, decadence, and privilege among the militia, not only had cadres conduct ideological education in squads and platoons but also stipulated a collective discussion for the entire district every three days. After the rectification and training of the militia in five villages in the seventh district of Shen County, they gathered at Zhangwa on the night of October 24th to pursue special agents. On the night of November 28th, the militia of Wangjiazu in the first district of Qinghe captured nine Chiang agents. The rectified militia have fully demonstrated a hundredfold confidence to wage a struggle against both big and small Chiang Kaisheks to defend the land and their homes.

    [Report from Weixian, 15th of this month] The news of Chiang bandit's offensive towards the Daming area reached Jize, enraging 80,000 liberated peasants. War mobilization has penetrated every corner. Everyone is acting together, emptying their homes, burying grain, transforming village fortifications, and preparing to launch guerrilla warfare. More than 4,000 militiamen throughout the county are training intensely, and the self-defense forces of dozens of villages have also voluntarily joined the training movement. Farmers in Wu Guanying said: "We must prepare ourselves well, and when Chiang bandit comes, we will give him a hard knock." Labor hero Gao Waixian personally led the militia of Fuma Village to train, preparing to repel Chiang bandit. Amid the urgent war preparations, the farmers continue to carry out winter production. The villages along the Fuyang River are even busier, opening the sluice gates to irrigate the land in the morning and preparing for war in the afternoon. Old hero Cai Wenzhang said: "If we irrigate the land in winter, we can plant seedlings next spring whether it rains or not. With food and clothing, we will have more strength to fight Old Chiang!" Song Ai, the textile hero of Fengguanying, said: "We have war experience, we defeated Japan, and if Chiang bandit dares to come, he will die here too!"

            Yushe Rectification: Learning from Recalling Experiences

    [Report from Changzhi] The rectification and training of more than 200 militia cadres in Yushe ended at the end of last month. Each district has challenged each other to ensure the completion of this winter's militia rectification and training tasks. At the beginning of this rectification and training, class consciousness was greatly enhanced due to the study of current events, and a fervent hard-training movement quickly unfolded. Heroes challenged heroes, companies challenged companies, and even platoons and squads challenged each other. All comrades of the Second Platoon of the Third Company got up before dawn to learn bayonet fighting, and during daytime breaks, they also researched and practiced hard. Zhang Zisheng, Zhao Bujin, and others recalled supporting the Tai Valley border area when they fought an encounter battle with the enemy on the plains. Because they did not know how to use the terrain, they were in a state of panic and almost suffered losses. In a certain village ambush battle, they captured a machine gun, but lacking combat skills, it was also quite dangerous. Hei Weijiang, who was particularly clumsy, actively responded to the rectification and training department's call of "the clumsy bird flies first, the clumsy person moves first," always studying before others and resting after others. Although Duan Weize, who was over forty years old, was old, he was very active in learning. He said: "I am an old youth, I am old but my heart is not old!" During the hard-training movement, everyone learned from each other, learned from each other's strengths, and made a guarantee that "everyone will learn a set of skills." Du Erfu, the director of the old cadre military committee of Yuncun, taught more than twenty people how to use machine guns in eight days. At the conclusion of the rectification and training meeting, in order to defend the good times of liberation and prepare self-defense forces, a fervent challenge was launched between districts and joint defense units, guaranteeing the complete and victorious completion of this year's rectification and training tasks.
