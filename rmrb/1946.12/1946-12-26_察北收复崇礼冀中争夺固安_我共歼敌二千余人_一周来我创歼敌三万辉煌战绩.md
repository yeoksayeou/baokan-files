Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 23rd: Comprehensive war report for the week (16th to 22nd):

　　During this week, the focus of the war shifted to the Su-Wan-North front, where Chiang's troops fiercely attacked the Lianshui and Shuyang areas, and launched diversionary offensives on the Su-Wan-South and Lu-South fronts. Simultaneously, fierce battles also occurred in the Ping-Jin-Bao triangle area. The People's Liberation Army achieved successive victories in self-defense wars on all fronts, creating a brilliant record of annihilating over 30,000 Chiang's troops in a single week.

　　Su-Wan Front: On the northern front, Chiang's troops, including the 11th, 26th, 57th, and 69th Divisions, moved from Suqian and the Lianghuai area to attack the Shuyang River, and the 74th Division and others attacked the area between the New Fourth Army's Grand Canal and the Shuyang River near Lianshui. In a large-scale mobile warfare from the 15th to the 19th, three brigades, one regiment, and one engineer battalion were annihilated, and one brigade was routed, totaling over 20,000 Chiang's troops annihilated in this campaign. Additionally, over 2,000 enemy troops were killed or captured in the suburbs of Lianshui. On the southern front, the Chiang's 83rd and 65th Divisions, which invaded Yancheng, also suffered over 1,000 casualties. This unprecedentedly huge victory has greatly weakened Chiang's military strength in Su-Wan. Meanwhile, on the Lu-South front, the 44th Brigade of Chiang's 26th Division, the 80th Brigade of the 28th Division, and the 77th Division advanced eastward from the Taizao line towards Xiangcheng, about 70 li southwest of Linyi, where they were met with a head-on blow by the New Fourth Army. From the 12th to the 26th, Chiang's troops suffered over 1,000 casualties, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.

　　Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Front: On the 14th, the Taiyue Eighth Route Army once again liberated the county towns of Jiyuan and Yuanqu. The Taihang Eighth Route Army, starting from the evening of the 10th, after a day and night of fierce fighting, recovered five important towns west of Tangyin City on the Ping-Han Railway, including Hekou. In these two campaigns, over 1,000 Chiang's troops were annihilated.

　　Jin-Southwest Front: On the 12th, the Lvliang Eighth Route Army liberated Zhongyang City, capturing alive over 1,600 Yan's troops, including the deputy commander of the 45th Division, and killing or wounding over 200. The liberation of this city has linked the two major liberated areas of Jin-Southwest and Jin-Northwest into one. Under the encirclement and suppression and persuasion of the local army and people, over 3,500 remnants of Yan's troops, who had fled into the mountains and fields of counties such as Daning, have repented and surrendered to the democratic government with their weapons.

　　Jin-Cha-Ji Front: Chiang's 94th Army and other units are invading the liberated areas in the Ping-Jin-Bao triangle area. In the battle for Gu'an City, Chiang's troops suffered over 1,000 casualties. On the 15th, the Ji-East Eighth Route Army recovered Baodi City, killing or capturing over 600 Chiang's puppet troops. The Chahar-North Eighth Route Army fiercely counterattacked the towns occupied by Fu's troops. After recovering Pindingbao, an important town under the jurisdiction of Guyuan County, and annihilating 500 enemy cavalry, they continued to recover Chongli County, 100 li northeast of Zhangjiakou, on the 9th, annihilating over 1,200 Fu's puppet troops.

　　察北收复崇礼冀中争夺固安
    我共歼敌二千余人
    一周来我创歼敌三万辉煌战绩
    【新华社延安二十三日电】一周综合战报：（十六至二十二）
    本周内战事重心移至苏皖北线，蒋军猛犯涟水、沭阳地区，并在苏皖南线及鲁南发动牵制性进攻。同时，平津保三角地带亦发生激战。人民解放军在各线自卫战争中，纷纷告捷，创造了一周内毙俘蒋军三万余人的辉煌战绩。
    苏皖方面：北线蒋军整十一师、二十六师、五十七师、六十九师等部，由宿迁及两淮窜犯沭河，以及七十四师等部窜犯涟水新四军运河与沭河之间地区。自十五日迄十九日之巨大运动战中，歼灭其三个旅又一个团、一个工兵营，并击溃其一个旅，此役共聚歼蒋军两万余人。另在涟水城郊毙俘其两千余人。而南线进犯盐城之蒋军八十三师、六十五师等部，亦被歼千余人。此一空前巨大的胜利，已大大的削弱了蒋军在苏皖的力量。同时，鲁南蒋军二十六师之四十四旅、二十八师之八十旅及七十七师等部自台枣一线东犯临沂西南七十里向城等地，遭新四军迎头痛击。十二日至二十六日蒋军损失千余人，现仍激战中。
    晋冀鲁豫方面：太岳八路军于十四日再度光复济源、垣曲两县城。太行八路军自十日晚起，经一昼夜激战，收复平汉路汤阴城西之河口等重镇五处。两役共歼灭蒋军千余人。
    晋西南方面：吕梁八路军于十二日解放中阳城，生俘阎军四十五师副师长以下千六百余人，另毙伤其二百余。该城之解放，已使晋西南与晋西北两大解放区联成一片。在当地军民的围剿与劝导下，逃窜于大宁等县山野间的阎军残部，已有三千五百余人携械向民主政府悔过自新。
    晋察冀方面：蒋军九十四军等部，正窜犯平津保三角地带之解放区，在固安城争夺战中，蒋军伤亡千余人。冀东八路军于十五日收复宝坻城，毙俘蒋伪军六百余人。察北八路军猛烈反击傅军侵占城镇，继收复沽源县属重镇平定堡，歼敌骑五百后，续于九日收复张家口东北一百里之崇礼县城，歼灭傅伪军一千二百余人。
