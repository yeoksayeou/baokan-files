    On the Stockaded Wall

    Just as the sky was beginning to brighten, the regiment commander, deputy regiment commander, and political commissar all went up to the stockaded wall.

    Looking down from the southeast corner of the stockaded wall, the area blocked by two deep moats, each more than a fathom wide, seemed impossible to cross. So steep to climb down, and so steep to climb up. One moat, two moats, plus the abatis and the countless gun emplacements in the stockaded wall, spewing out a dense net of fire. Yet, the breakthrough point was right here. Last night, from the command post in the open field three hundred meters away, I saw many dark figures, braving the intense artillery fire, courageously scaling the stockaded wall, right here. Chiang’s troops threw down flares, incendiary bombs, and counterattacked from above, and the 3rd company was pushed down five times, and five times charged back up, this magnificent scene unfolded right here as well. This couldn't help but remind me of Lü Yuanzi, known for its solid fortifications—this reactionary feudal fortress in the border region of Lu (Shandong) and Yu (Henan), which supposedly had not been breached from the Taiping Rebellion to the War of Resistance Against Japan, was also conquered by Regiment ×.

    The deputy regiment commander pulled aside the abatis that had collapsed to the foot of the wall, revealing the concealed machine-gun position: "You see, when you charged to the ten-plus meters of open ground between the two moats, you would suddenly be swept by gunfire, unable to advance or retreat. This fortification is indeed more formidable than Lü Yuanzi; but we still conquered it." He said, smiling with satisfaction for having seen through the enemy's cunning plan. He personally went with the militiamen to scout the outer moat and personally directed the artillery to destroy the firing points.

    The sounds of people below the outer moat attracted me, and I followed the footprints and climbed down with great effort. Several soldiers were helping the villagers to pull door panels from the soil. It turned out this was a hidden bunker less than half a foot high, blocking the outer moat, with a tunnel leading into the stockaded wall, which had now been blasted. The old villager carrying the door panel said: "The Chiang troops relentlessly oppressed us, forcing us to build this for half a month, and every family lost their doors! It's harder than a turtle shell, if our Eighth Route Army was defending, even ten thousand of them wouldn't be able to break through." "Even if they defend, they're sure to run away, aren't these people all captured?" The soldier's humorous reply made everyone burst into laughter.

    I climbed back up the stockaded wall, and the commanders were still there, studying the construction and firepower deployment of the Chiang troops' fortifications. The sky was completely light, and I noticed that all three of them were covered in layers of dust from head to toe, with red lines in their eyes. I knew that they hadn't closed their eyes for two full days and nights since the battle, but what aroused my infinite respect was not only their courage and resourcefulness in commanding the battle, but also their meticulous and tireless learning even after their victory. Facing the morning sun, they stood tall on the high, newly liberated stockaded wall of Shao'erzhai.

    寨墙上
    吴象
    天刚蒙蒙亮，团长、副团长、政委都到寨墙上去了。
    从寨墙的东南角上往下看，要通过两道宽深逾丈的外壕封锁的地带简直是不可能。爬下去这么陡峭，爬上来又这么陡峭。一道，两道，还有鹿砦，寨墙碉堡无数的枪眼，射出密集的火网。然而，突破口就在这里。昨晚我在三百米外野地的指挥所里，看见许多黑影，冒着密集的炮火奋勇攀登寨墙，就在这里。蒋军掷下照明弹、燃烧弹、居高临下反扑着，第三连被扑下五次，又五次冲上去，展开这壮烈场面的，也就在这里。这使我不禁想起以工事坚固著称的吕园子——鲁豫边这个据说从太平天国到抗日战争，都没有被人打开的反动封建堡垒，也是×团攻克的。
    副团长拉开塌倒到墙脚跟的鹿砦，掩蔽的机枪阵地，显露出来了：“你看，等你冲到两道外壕之间这十多米空地时，就突然扫射你，使你进又进不得，退又退不得，这工事实在比吕园子更凶了；但是我们还是战胜了它。”他说着，因为识破敌人的狡计而满意地笑了，他是有充分胜利自豪的。他亲自和民兵到外壕侦察，又亲自指挥炮兵摧毁火力点。
    外壕底下的人声吸引了我，我顺着有脚印的地方很吃力地爬了下去。几个战士在帮助老乡，从土里抽出门板来，原来这是个不及半尺高封锁外壕的暗堡，有一条地道通进寨墙，现在已经炸塌了。抬门板的老乡说：“遭殃军不歇气的压迫咱们，修了半个月，家家都没有门啦！真是比乌龟壳还硬，要是咱八路守，他十万人也保险攻不开。”“他守也保险，保险跑不掉，这些人不是都俘虏了吗？”战士这个幽默的回答，使大家哄笑起来了。
    我又爬上寨墙，指挥员们还在那里研究蒋军的工事构造与火力配备。天完全亮了，我发现他们三个人满头满脸满身都蒙上了一层层土，眼里露着红丝。我知道战斗以来，他们整整两天两夜没有合过眼了，然而激起我无限敬意的，不仅是他们指挥作战的勇敢机智，而且是在他们胜利之后，仍然如此细心地、不疲倦地学习。迎着晨曦他们在高的重获解放的邵耳寨寨墙上屹立着。
