　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 4th: According to reports from various news agencies, Dutch and French imperialist elements have recently engaged in new machinations, attempting to strike at the national regimes of Indonesia and Vietnam, and to overturn the agreements previously signed recognizing the achievements of these national struggles. An Associated Press report states that since the end of November, fierce fighting has resumed in various islands of Indonesia, and the Dutch cabinet has also faced a crisis because the military faction opposes the agreement signed between the Dutch government and Indonesia on November 15th (Note: This agreement recognizes the sovereignty of the Indonesian Republican government over the islands of Java, Madura, and Sumatra).
　　A Dutch news agency reported that Dutch troop ships continue to arrive in Indonesia, indicating that the war will continue to expand. Regarding Vietnam: The French military authorities stationed in Vietnam again used pretexts to attack Vietnamese troops in Haiphong in mid-to-late November, with street fighting lasting for more than ten days. The urban area suffered severe damage, and the fighting has now spread to the area between Haiphong and Lang Son. However, the Vietnamese troops are firmly defending the urban area of Haiphong and the suburban positions. According to an Associated Press report, the French troops suffered heavy casualties.

    【新华社延安四日电】据各通讯社报导：荷兰及法国帝国主义分子近又有新的策动，图谋打击印尼越南的民族政权，取消前此签订的承认这些民族斗争成果的协定。美联社消息称：自十一月底开始，激烈的战事又在印尼各岛进行，同时荷兰内阁又发生危机，因为军人派反对荷政府十一月十五日与印尼签订的协定（按：该协定承认印尼共和政府在爪哇、马都拉、苏门答腊三岛的主权）。
    荷兰通讯社报导：荷兰运兵船继续抵达印尼，表示战事将继续扩大。越南方面：驻越法军当局于上月中下旬复借端攻击海防越军，巷战达十余日，市区遭受严重破坏，刻战事已发展至海防至谅山一带，惟越军乃坚守海防市区及郊外阵地。据美联社报导，法军死伤颇重。
