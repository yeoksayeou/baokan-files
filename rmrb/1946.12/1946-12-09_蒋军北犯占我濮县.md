　　[Our Correspondent on the Jin-Lu-Yu Front, 5th] The 5th Army and other units of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who had occupied Puyang, continued to invade the Northeast. The enemy, advancing eastward through places like Liuxiatun and Xiaopuzhou, invaded our Puyang county seat on the afternoon of the 4th. The enemy north of Puyang city has infiltrated to Yonggu Village, 20 miles south of Qingfeng. Our local military and civilians are currently blocking, attacking, and harassing them along the way, inflicting significant casualties on the invading troops.
