　　Promoting the Spirit of Mutual Assistance and Friendship: Qin Village Helps Refugees Settle Down

　　[Reported by this newspaper] More than ninety family members of mine area cadres and mass leaders from Shangbaizuo and Tazhang villages in Jiaozuo City, in groups of three or five, were escorted station by station and arrived in Qin Village, Lingchuan County, in late November. The people of Qin Village rushed over, some shouting welcome slogans, others warmly greeting them, welcoming the ninety-plus fellow sufferers into the village. Men, women, old and young, were all exceptionally busy, cleaning houses for them, lending furniture, bringing boiled water to the elderly, and handing steamed buns to the children, making them feel as warm as if they had returned home. Many elderly people were moved to tears. To welcome this new group of migrants, the whole village held a welcome meeting with gongs and drums. The meeting place was marked with the slogan "Welcome Fellow Sufferers, Help Solve Difficulties." The refugees were invited to sit on tables and chairs as honored guests, and village cadres cordially greeted them with cigarettes and tea, inquiring about any difficulties in the refugees' homes so that everyone could think of ways to help solve them. The refugee representatives sincerely thanked the people of the old liberated area for their help, saying, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the poor are all equally warm to each other." We must work hard and be ready to fight back to Jiaozuo at any time. The farmers of Qin Village were busy setting off to participate in the war and support the front, and they could not manage the autumn plowing. The refugee representatives voluntarily drove their livestock to help them plow the fields. The two sides showed extraordinary closeness. Besides taking care of the food and drink for people and animals, they also gave five sheng of rice per mu of land, and in a few days they plowed over one qing and sixty mu of land. The textile movement of the refugee families has also been launched under the unified planning of winter production in Qin Village. The women have lent out their textile tools and are weaving cloth together by machine. In addition to providing for their own lives, many refugee families are wearing new cotton clothes for the winter season. With the joint efforts of both sides, a new small-scale textile factory has been established. They work together, study together, and from time to time there are joyful songs. These people who are far away from their homes all have new hope. (Hao Dong)

　　发扬互助友爱精神秦庄帮助难胞安家
    【本报讯】焦作市上白作、塔掌两村的九十多个矿区干部和群众领袖的家属，三五一伙的，被一站一站的护送着，于上月下旬到达陵川秦庄。秦庄的人群涌过来，有的喊着欢迎口号，有的亲热的赶来招呼，把九十多位患难同胞迎进村子。男女老少都格外的忙碌，给他们打扫屋子、借家具、给老年人端开水，向小孩手里递蒸馍，使他们感到像回到家里一样的亲热，许多老年人都感动的流出了眼泪。为着迎接这批新的客民，全村锣鼓喧天的开了一个欢迎会。会场上写着“欢迎患难同胞，帮助解决困难”的标语。难民们被请到桌椅上当作上宾，村干部殷勤的招呼他们吸烟、喝茶，征询难民家中有什么困难，大家好想办法帮助解决。难民代表赤诚的感谢老解放区群众对他们的帮助，他说：“在毛主席领导下，穷人都是一样亲热”。我们一定要努力干，随时准备打回焦作去。秦庄农民忙着出发参战支差，秋垡地忙不过来，难民代表就自动把牲口赶出来帮他们犁地。双方表现得异常亲密，每天除了管人和牲口吃喝，一亩地还给五升米，几天就垡完一顷六十多亩地。难民家属的纺织运动，也在秦庄冬季生产统一筹划下开展起来了。妇女们把纺织工具都借出来，搭伙按机织布。难民家属，除了供自己生活，冬天换季外，许多人还穿上新的棉衣。在双方共同的努力下，一座新的小型纺织工厂，建立起来了。她们在一起工作，一起学习，不时发出愉快的歌声。这群远离家乡的人民都有着新的希望。（浩东）
