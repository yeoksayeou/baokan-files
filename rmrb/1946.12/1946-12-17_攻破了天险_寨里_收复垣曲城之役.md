Conquering the Natural Barrier - Zhai Li
The Battle to Recover Yuanqu City
Yan Jin

The north bank of the Yellow River, with its cliffs rising a thousand feet, two ravines extending over three hundred meters east to west, and a moat in the north, formed a natural barrier – Zhai Li. The regimental headquarters of the Chiang army's 163rd Regiment was stationed here. On the afternoon of the sixth, a unit of our detachment received the mission and conducted a tense mobilization on the forward slope. Liu Minggui, a member of the 3rd Company assault team, took out his fountain pen, watch, and three thousand Jicha banknotes, paid his Party dues, and guaranteed to the Party that he would resolutely complete the mission under any circumstances. The entire unit was filled with a belief in victory. Before the battle began, a torrent of iron was waiting for the battle order in the trenches only one to two hundred meters away from the enemy's碉堡.

At dusk, the massive roar of our mountain guns shook the earth. Under the cover of dense firepower, the combatants crawled out of the trenches and advanced through the rain of bullets. Combatant Zhang Chenshui was seriously wounded. Everyone helped him up and asked him to go to the rear, but this hero with an iron will declared, "The squad leader hasn't gone down yet, what's the point of going back?" As he spoke, he gripped his rifle and limped forward with difficulty, crawling to the side of the wounded squad leader, Chang Siming. He forgot that he was injured and excitedly said, "Squad leader, I will avenge you!" He continuously fired at the enemy's 碉堡, shouting loudly, "Comrades, charge! I'll cover you."

Company Commander Ren Yushu led the grenade throwing team and explosives team to bravely charge to the bottom of the 碉堡, throwing grenades one after another into the enemy's 碉堡,炸得 the enemy couldn't resist and jumped out of the 碉堡 one by one. The 碉堡 on the western periphery were captured by us one after another. The 7th Company connected with the 8th Company to advance forward, but were pushed back by the enemy's firepower for the second time. The company commander said, "Damn it, no matter how bad the terrain is, I will always attack." The battle temporarily stopped, with only sparse gunfire remaining.

At 8:00 p.m., in a dangerous area forty to fifty meters away from the fortress, an experienced and young commander carefully reorganized the firepower and assigned tasks. Finally, Commissar ×'s voice reminded: "After entering the 碉堡, we must strictly pay attention to the policy on prisoners." Our mountain guns and heavy and light machine guns began to fire, surrounding and blockading all the enemy's 碉堡 and fortifications.

Du Xiuren was the company commander of the 2nd Company. He had been wounded three times recently, with bandages still wrapped around his head and shrapnel still lodged in his leg. This time, he insisted on participating in the battle. After several attempts to dissuade him, he resolutely followed to the front line, shouldering the important task of directing part of the firepower. He lay in the blockhouse, monitoring the enemy and covering the advance of the troops.

The blockhouse on the city gate was emitting black smoke, because this was the focus of our firepower. The enemy's machine gunner on the blockhouse was hit by the second shell and rolled down the city wall along with his gun. At this time, the young commander was personally directing the artillery position, "Number 20 fire," "Number 12 fire," "Number 5 fire"... his tone filled with excitement and confidence. Regiment Commander Shen of a certain regiment was throwing grenades along with the soldiers. The troops had already rushed to the front of the enemy's blockhouse. Two comrades on the cloud ladder were wounded, and someone else automatically braved the artillery fire to take their place. The fire illuminated the sky above Zhai Li Fortress. A certain instructor of our regiment approached the concealed trench sixteen meters from the 碉堡 and shouted, "Surrender quickly, life and death are in these few minutes, the gun is not your own anyway, don't sell your life for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek." The troops continued to move forward, crossed the concealed 碉堡, and climbed the cloud ladder. The enemy panicked and retreated, some even jumping off the city wall. After Comrade Ji Tianxiang helped the assault team ascend the city, he immediately crossed the battlefield to pursue the fleeing enemy. Jiang Shaogang, the deputy commander of the 163rd Regiment, fled in a panic like a stray dog, crying, "I'm heartbroken, I still have a wife and mother at home!..." He seemed not to hear the shouting of our soldiers and desperately jumped into the Yellow River. By the time we fished him out, Jiang Shaogang had already perished as a victim of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy, his body lying on the land liberated by the People's Liberation Army. In the winter of the northern country, the victory bugle call of the People's Liberation Army resonated with the mighty Yellow River, sounding in the treacherous Zhai Li. Commanders and combatants laughed proudly in front of their own masterpiece.

　　攻破了天险——寨里
    收复垣曲城之役
    言谨
    削壁千仞的黄河北岸，东西深达三百余公尺的两条鸿沟，北面据有城壕，构成了一座自然的天险——寨里，蒋军一六三团的团部就扎在这里。六日下午我某支队一部接受了任务，在前坡紧张的作了动员，三连突击队员刘明贵掏出水笔、手表和三千元冀钞，缴了党费，向党保证，不论在任何情况下坚决要完成任务，整个部队都充满着胜利的信念。战斗开始前，离敌人碉堡只有一二百公尺的壕里，有一支铁流，在等候着战斗命令。
    黄昏，我们山炮的巨大吼声震撼了土地，在密集的火力掩护下，战斗员爬出壕沟，冒着弹雨向前推进。战斗员张陈水挂了重彩，大家扶起他，要他回后面去，可是这位具有铁的意志的英雄表示着：“班长还没下来，回去干啥？”说看，他捉着枪柄吃力的跛着腿跑上前去，爬在负伤的班长常思明的身边，他忘记了自己已经负伤，却兴奋地说：“班长，我要为你报仇！”他接连向敌人的碉堡射击，大声叫喊道：“同志们，冲啊！我为你们掩护。”
    任玉树连长带领投弹组和炸药组勇猛的冲到碉堡底下，手榴弹一颗颗地投到敌人的碉堡里，炸得敌人招架不住，一个个跳下碉堡去。西面外围的碉堡便一个接连一个地被我们夺过来了。七连接着八连向前推进，第二次被敌人的火力压回来了，连长说：“妈的，地形再恶劣我总是要攻上去的。”战斗暂时停止下来，只留有稀疏的枪声。
    晚上八时，距堡子四五十公尺的危险地带，一个老练而年青的指挥员，在周祥的重新组织火力，分配了任务。最后是×政委叮咛的声音：“进碉堡后，我们要严格注意俘虏政策。”我们的山炮轻重机枪开始放射了，火力包围和封锁住敌人所有的碉堡和工事。
    杜修仁是第二连的连长，最近负伤三次，头上还包扎着绷带，腿上的弹片还没有取出，这次却非参加战斗不行，经几次劝阻，仍坚决的跟上火线来，担负着指挥一部分火力的重大任务。他伏在炮楼里监视着敌人和掩护部队前进。
    城门上的炮楼在冒着黑烟，因为这是我们火力射击的重点，炮楼上敌人的机枪手被第二颗炮弹命中了，连人带枪滚下城墙。这时年青的指挥员，正在炮兵阵地上亲自指挥着：“第二十号打”“第十二号打”“第五号打”……语气里充满着兴奋与信心。某团申团长正在跟战士们一起投手榴弹，部队已冲至敌人炮楼跟前了，云梯上两个同志挂彩了，又有人自动冒着炮火顶上去，火光照亮了寨里堡的上空，我某指导员接近在碉堡十六公尺的埯蔽壕里喊话：“赶紧缴枪吧，生死就在这几分钟里，枪又不是你自己的，不要替汉奸蒋介石卖命了。”部队接连向前移动，越过了暗堡，都登上了云梯，敌人慌乱了，退却了，有些甚至从城墙上跳下来。吉天祥同志帮着突击队登城以后，立刻穿过战场追击正慌忙溃逃的敌人，一六三团副团长蒋少刚慌慌忙忙的如丧家之犬逃跑着，哭叫着：“伤心呀，家里还有老婆和母亲！……”他似乎没有听到我们战士们的喊话，没命的跳进黄河里去了。待我们把他捞出时，蒋少刚已作为蒋介石内战政策的牺牲品，陈尸在人民解放军光复了的土地上。北国的冬天，人民解放军胜利的号音，与浩浩的黄河水合奏着，在这天险的寨里响起来了，指挥员战斗员在自己的杰作面前，骄傲的欢笑。
