　　Great Teacher of the Chinese Military
  　——General Liu Bocheng Respectfully Praises Commander-in-Chief Zhu
    [Our front-line reporter team, 29th dispatch] Ever-victorious General Liu Bocheng, Commander, stated: Commander-in-Chief Zhu De is the "Great Teacher of the Chinese Military." General Liu and Commander-in-Chief Zhu have been old friends since 1919. During the civil war, General Zhu De was the Commander-in-Chief, and General Liu was his Chief of Staff. Before Commander-in-Chief Zhu's sixtieth birthday, the reporter paid a special visit to General Liu to inquire about his impressions. General Liu spoke with enthusiasm, joy, and respect. Pointing out the characteristics of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, he said: First, he has always stood on the side of the people. From participating in the Xinhai Revolution to opposing Yuan Shikai's traitorous autocracy, opposing Duan Qirui's pro-foreign dictatorship, up to the land revolution, the eight-year War of Resistance, and today's patriotic self-defense war of the Chinese people, the Commander-in-Chief has always unequivocally stood on the side of the people. The Commander-in-Chief is a senior figure in the Chinese military, and his glorious history can provide invaluable inspiration and encouragement to all Chinese soldiers. Those who obey the people prosper, and those who defy the people die. All Chinese soldiers who seek a way out must learn this spirit of Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Second, his will is as firm as iron, and he never harbors feelings of failure. Before participating in the revolution, the Commander-in-Chief lived a life of ease. Even without promotion or wealth, he could have lived a comfortable life. However, once he recognized the revolution, he discarded everything without looking back. Later, in the face of any difficulty, he remained calm and composed, which is deeply moving. In addition, the Commander-in-Chief's consideration of the overall situation, his generosity, his integration with the masses, his sharing of hardships with the soldiers, and his spirit of being studious, thoughtful, and tireless in teaching have been widely recognized. During the Jinggang Mountains era, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the soldiers carried firewood and rice together. The Commander-in-Chief's carrying pole had the five large characters "Zhu De's Carrying Pole" written on it, which is still a popular story. During the War of Resistance against Japan, there were several Indian revolutionaries in Shanxi who often argued and could not unite closely due to differences in political views. The Commander-in-Chief asked them with extreme sincerity, "Why did you come to China? Who is your enemy?" Then he said, "Since your common enemy is British imperialism, aren't you helping British imperialism by fighting among yourselves!" They suddenly realized and reconciled. All these things should be deeply considered and diligently learned by young revolutionary soldiers. General Liu concluded by saying: The fundamental spirit that enables the Commander-in-Chief to become Chairman Mao's helper, to build such a strong people's army, and to lead the Chinese people in opposing the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship in order to win democracy and freedom for the people of the whole country, lies in unconditionally dedicating everything to the revolution and to the people. This is what every member of our people's army deeply respects and strives to learn. (Li Pu)

　　中国军人的伟大导师
  　——刘伯承将军敬赞朱总司令
    【本报前线记者团二十九日电】常胜将军刘伯承司令称：朱德总司令为“中国军人的伟大导师”。刘将军与朱总司令为自民国八年以来之老友，内战时朱德将军为总司令，刘将军又为其总参谋长。记者特于朱总司令六十大庆前夕走访刘将军，叩询观感。刘将军积极欣喜与尊敬之情。指出朱总司令之特点称：第一、自始至终站在人民方面。从参加辛亥革命开始，至反袁世凯卖国专制，反段祺瑞媚外独裁，以迄土地革命，八年抗战，至今日中国人民之爱国自卫战诸重要阶段，总司令无不明确的站在人民方面。总司令为中国军人之老前辈，其光荣的历史实可给予中国一切军人以极有价值之启示与鼓励。顺民者昌，逆民者死，中国一切军人要求生路，唯有学习朱总司令此种精神。第二、志坚如铁，从无失败情绪。总司令参加革命以前，生活优裕，即不升官发财，亦足以度其舒适之一生，然当其一旦认识革命，即弃如敝屣，一无反顾；以后在任何困难之前，坦然如坐春风，尤足使人深深感动。此外总司令之顾全大局，量大如海，生活群众化，与士兵同艰苦，以及好学深思，诲人不倦之精神，已为世人所共见。井岗山时代，毛主席、朱总司令与战士一同挑柴、担米，总司令之扁担上大书“朱德的扁担”五个大字，至今传为佳话。抗战期间在山西有几个印度革命者，因政见不同而时相争吵，不能亲密团结，总司令以极度恳切之态度问道：“你们到中国来为了什么？你们的敌人是谁？”然后说：“既然你们共同的敌人是英帝国主义，你们自己打架，不是帮了英帝国主义的忙吗！”于是他们猛然省悟，重归和好。凡此种种，青年革命军人均应再三深思，努力学习。刘将军末谓：总司令之所以能成为毛主席的帮手，建立如此强大的人民军队，为中国人民反对卖国贼蒋介石之独裁，以争取全国人民之民主自由，其基本精神乃在于无条件的把个人的一切贡献于革命，贡献于人民，这是我们人民军队的每一个成员极度尊敬和加紧学习的。（李普）
