　　Overcoming Winter Laziness, Combining with Spring Ploughing Preparations
    Relying on the Mountains to Eat Mountains, Relying on Water to Eat Water, Various Places Vigorously Develop Winter Production
    [This newspaper, Changzhi, 1st dispatch] In the old liberated areas of Taihang, the winter production movement has been universally launched. This year's production content mainly includes transportation, textile, workshops, saltpeter boiling, mountain products gathering, etc. Generally, all localities have absorbed the experience of last winter, and have determined the focus of production based on the principle of "relying on the mountains to eat mountains, and relying on water to eat water," and have also allocated tasks according to labor strength and technical level. Zuoquan provided 8 million yuan in winter loans, of which 2 million yuan was used to support textiles. In the newly liberated areas, cotton for textiles is loaned by the county cooperative, and the spun yarn is sold by the county cooperative. Agricultural loans of 3 million yuan are issued in advance to provide the masses with convenient working capital to lay the foundation for next year's spring plowing movement. Heshun decided to vigorously develop transportation. Nuanyao Village in the county, under the leadership of labor hero Zheng Yinxian, transported 30,000 catties of coal to the × factory in 25 days, earning 300,000 yuan. After the autumn harvest in Xiazhuang, Licheng, ten small cooperatives and one textile factory were organized, with 176 laborers and 87 livestock. In one month, they earned more than 340,000 yuan. Qilidian (30 households), a small village, reviewed the idea of winter leisure a month ago, and established a cooperative by pooling shares, which has already made a profit of more than 30,000 yuan. Labor hero Sun Aiting of Xiwu Village actively organized transportation, using 14 carts to transport legs to Changzhi, making one round trip every seven days, earning 148,000 yuan. Now it has been increased to 29 carts and developed into a transportation team. Only two groups transported four times and earned more than 830,000 yuan. Shexian Shibao Village combines emancipation with production, producing in the morning, reasoning in the afternoon, and summarizing and brewing at night. In the gaps, labor is organized to transport cotton to Longhu, transporting twice a day, 130 catties per bale. In eight and a half days, 48 laborers earned 120,000 yuan. Since the 5th to the 20th of last month, the fourth district of Wuxiang has newly developed 22 small cooperatives, bought 25 pigs, and 70 people participated in transportation, earning a total of more than 128,000 yuan. In the past half month, the fifth district of Wu'an has developed 19 small textile factories. Within ten days, three villages (Naoshang, Huleishan, and Baoziyu) earned a total of more than 94,000 yuan. Shannan Bottom in Pingshun summarized one month of transportation, with 35 people and 20 livestock earning more than 80,000 yuan. At the same time, it was found that there was still the idea of "take a break" where "enough grain is harvested to eat, enough cotton is grown to wear, half a year of hard work, half a year of leisure." It was immediately discussed and corrected. The summary also discussed the combination of transportation and fertilizer transportation, so as to avoid repeating the mistake of decoupling winter production from spring plowing preparation last winter.
    [This newspaper, Weixian, 1st dispatch] Weixian is actively carrying out winter production. The Shengfotang mutual aid team, under the leadership of Shi Decai, after precise division of labor, has seven groups starting ginning in late October of the lunar calendar, five groups pulling porcelain to Quzhou twice, eight groups opening mills, and three groups are preparing to set up tofu workshops. There are also some people who have not moved because of disagreements. In early September, the mutual aid team held another meeting to discuss and decided to vigorously develop sideline occupations. After the meeting, Zhang Guilin and others joined forces to prepare to fluff cotton. A few people are also planning to engage in suitable sideline occupations. Women in Lutai are actively weaving, and the profits are very large. Out of 200 households in the village, 130 households with 248 people are spinning and weaving. A 13-year-old girl weaves two bolts of cloth in four days and sells them for 1,600 yuan. An old woman and a small granddaughter weave a bolt of cloth in five days, which can earn enough for the two of them to eat, drink, and spend. The grain harvested by the old man Zhang Xizhen and his wife is only enough for one person for one year. From July to October, the couple earned one pocket of wheat and three pockets of millet by spinning and weaving, which is no less than what they harvested from the land. Therefore, many women and men who cannot spin and weave are also learning to spin and weave.

　　克服冬闲思想结合春耕准备
    靠山吃山靠水吃水各地大搞冬季生产
    【本报长治一日电】太行老区各地冬季生产运动，已普遍展开。今年生产内容主要是运输、纺织、作坊、熬硝、砍山货等。各地一般都吸取了去冬经验，以“靠山吃山、靠水吃水”为原则，确定生产重点，又按劳力强弱与技术高低分配任务。左权冬季贷款八百万元，即有二百万元用于扶助纺织。新区纺织均由县联社贷给棉花，纺成线由县联社销售，并提前发放农贷三百万元，给群众以运转活动便利，以便打下明年春耕运动基础。和顺决定大力开展运输，该县暖窑村在劳英郑银贤领导下，给×工厂廿五天运炭三万斤，就赚了三十万元。黎城霞庄秋收完毕即组织起小型合作社十个、纺织厂一处，劳力一百七十六个，畜力八十七个，一个月中已赚洋三十四万余元。七里店（三十户）小村，于月前检讨了冬闲思想，集股成立合作社，已获利三万余元。西仵村劳动英雄孙爱廷，积极组织运输，以大车十四辆往长治送脚，七天往返一回，赚洋十四万八千元，现已增加成二十九辆大车，发展为运输队，仅两个小组，运输了四次即赚洋八十三万余元。涉县石泊村以翻身结合生产，上午生产，下午说理，黑夜总结酝酿。在空隙中组织劳力到龙虎运棉花，一天运两次，每包一百三十斤，八天半四十八个劳力赚洋十二万元。武乡四区自上月五日到二十日新发展小型合作社二十二个，买猪二十五个，七十人参加运输，共赚洋十二万八千余元。武安五区半月来发展小型纺织厂十九处，十日内三个村（脑上、忽雷山、豹子峪）共赚洋九万四千余元。平顺山南底总结一月运输，三十五人、牲口二十头赚洋八万余元。同时发现还有“打下粮食够吃，搞下棉花够穿，半年辛苦，半年闲”的“歇一歇”思想。当即讨论纠正，总结时还讨论了运输与运肥结合等问题，以免重犯去冬生产与春耕准备脱节的毛病。
    【本报威县一日电】威县积极开展冬季生产。圣佛堂互助大队在石德才领导下，经精确分工后，已有七个组在阴历十月下旬开始轧花，五组向曲周拉了两次磁器，八组开磨坊，三组正准备设立豆腐坊。另有一些人，因意见不统一没有动起来。九月上旬该互助大队又开会商讨，决定大力开展副业，会后，张贵林等组合伙准备弹花。剩下少数人亦正计划搞合适的副业。陆台妇女积极纺织，获利甚大，全村二百余户，已有一百三十户二百四十八人纺花织布，一个十三岁的女孩，四天织了两个布，卖洋一千六百元。一个老妇和一个小孙女五天织一个布，能赚出二人的吃喝零用。老汉张西珍夫妇打的粮食只够一个人一年用，夫妇自七月至十月靠纺织已赚了一口袋麦子，三口袋谷子，比地里收的并不少。因此，许多不会纺织的妇女和男子也学起纺织来。
