　　[This report from our Yuci Bureau] The explosive movement in the border area of this county, combining landmines, sniping, and guerrilla warfare, has achieved remarkable results in the past three months. After Tian Si'er, an explosive hero, buried an iron mine that killed three Yan army soldiers, including a company commander, who were looting grain on September 8th, the people in the border area dispelled their impatience that landmines could not be buried in the plains and that burying landmines was useless. They put forward the slogan of not being afraid of failure, studying the enemy's patterns of action, and trying again if it didn't work the first time. They also implemented a joint defense system with mutual support between villages and districts. Since then, led by Nan and Bei Tian villages, it developed to more than 24 villages, including Lutai and Donghao, in less than a month. In October, with the cooperation of our local independent battalion, the movement was further extended to more than ten villages along the Tongpu Railway, such as Guocun and Nanya, and along the Zhengtai Railway, such as Dongzhao and Beihelu. Up to now, in the past three months, hundreds of militia, cadres, and local troops directly participating in the movement have cultivated explosive heroes and skilled mine layers through practical experience. From the mighty power of over a hundred large and small explosive battles, sniping battles, and guerrilla battles, they have defeated several so-called "flooding" offensives by Zhao Chengshui, Duan Bingchang, and other Yan puppet troops (including "Homecoming Corps" and "Rolling Teams") who were looting grain and conscripting soldiers. According to preliminary statistics, more than 230 enemy officers and soldiers below the battalion commander level have been killed or wounded. We recovered 37 *shi* of grain and 4 head of livestock; captured one machine gun, four rifles, more than 500 rounds of ammunition, and more than 600 *jin* of electric wire (cut from the Tongpu Railway); and captured 23 Yan puppet soldiers. Countless other spoils of war were seized. We suffered casualties including several people such as Lu Huimin, the joint county magistrate of Yuci, Taiyuan, and Qi County. (Shi Pingtao)

　　榆次边地爆炸运动向同蒲正太路开展
    三月歼敌营长以下二百余
    【本报榆次讯】本县边地地雷、冷枪与麻雀战相结合的爆炸运动，三月来战绩卓著。九月八日开始，爆炸英雄田四儿埋下的一个铁雷打死抢粮阎军连长以下三名后，边地人民解消了平川不能埋雷，埋雷也不顶事的急燥心理，提出了不怕失败，研究敌人行动规律，一次不行再来一次的口号。并实行村与村、区与区相声援的联防制度。从此，从南、北田村带头，不及一月，即发展到麓台、东郝等二十四个村庄。十月份，在我地方独立营配合下，更将运动推向同蒲铁路上的郭村、南要，正太铁路上的东赵、北合流等十余村庄。至目前为止，三个月来，直接参加运动之民兵、干部、地方部队从实际中培养出爆炸英雄、埋雷能手数以百计。从大小百余次的爆炸战、冷枪战、麻雀战的神威下，击溃了赵承绥、段炳昌等阎伪军（包括“还乡团”“滚滚队”）两千人的数次抢粮、抓丁的所谓“水漫”式进攻。据初步统计，敌人死伤营长以下官兵二百三十余名。我夺回粮食三十七石，牲口四头；缴获机枪一挺，步枪四枝，子弹五百多发，电线（同蒲路上割下的）六百余斤；俘虏阎伪军二十三名。其他战利品无算。我伤亡榆、太、祁联合县长吕惠民以下数名。（史平涛）
