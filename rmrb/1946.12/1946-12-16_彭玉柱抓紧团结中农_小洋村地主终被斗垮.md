　　Peng Yuzhu Grabs Hold of Uniting Middle Peasants
    Xiaoyang Village Landlord Finally Overthrown
    [Report from our correspondent in Wei County on the 13th] Jing County peasant leaders Peng Yuzhu and Yan Zhizhong, leading peasants in anti-special agent and emancipation struggles, were deeply supported by the masses. After Xiaoyang Village had a peasant association, it launched a struggle against the village's feudal forces. The landlord had organized a "Rich People's Association," manipulating a portion of bad elements to attack the peasant association unsuccessfully. Then they organized the Red Spear Society, directly colluding with the enemy to arrest peasant association cadres, attempting to crush the peasant association's organization. Under these serious circumstances, peasant association director Peng Yuzhu, Yan Zhizhong, and others, though forced to leave the village, still carried out covert activities in nearby villages. After a period of arduous struggle, the landlord's Red Spear Society collapsed, and the masses initially raised their heads. In order to retaliate against the masses, the vicious landlord shamelessly organized an "Assassination Squad." Peng Yuzhu led the members in continuing the struggle. Yan Shenglin was momentarily not vigilant enough and was stabbed eight times, and his son was killed, further arousing the masses' fighting spirit. In order to thoroughly defeat feudal rule and realize "land to the tiller," Peng Yuzhu and others absorbed a large number of middle peasants to participate in the peasant association, jointly conducting a struggle against treacherous and domineering landlords. As a result, a large amount of land and goods were struggled out, and the masses of the entire village achieved emancipation politically and economically. The masses said: "Without the Communist Party leading us to emancipation, we wouldn't get this land for generations, nor would we be able to defeat those traitorous bullies. Chairman Mao is truly the savior of us poor people."

　　彭玉柱抓紧团结中农
    小洋村地主终被斗垮
    【本报威县十三日电】景县农民领袖彭玉柱、阎之仲，领导农民进行反特翻身斗争，深得群众拥戴，小洋村自有了农会后，便与村里的封建势力展开斗争，地主曾组织过“富人会”，操纵一部分坏分子，向农会进攻未逞，即又组织红枪会，直接勾结敌人，抓捕农会干部，想摧垮农会的组织。在这种严重的情况下，农会主任彭玉柱、阎之仲等，虽被迫离开本村，但仍在附近各村进行隐蔽活动，经过了一段艰苦的斗争，地主的红枪会垮台了，群众初步的抬起头来。凶恶的地主为了对群众报复，又无耻的组织了“暗杀团”，彭玉柱领导着会员们继续斗争。阎盛林一时警惕不够，被刺八刀，其子被杀死，更激起了群众的斗争情绪。为了彻底打垮封建统治，实现“耕者有其田”，彭玉柱等便吸收广大中农参加农会，共同向着奸霸地主进行斗争。结果斗出了大批的土地及物品，全村群众在政治上经济上得到了翻身。群众说：“没有共产党领导我们翻身，几辈子也要不到这些地，也打不倒那些汉奸恶霸。毛主席真是咱们穷人的救星。”
