    [This report from Changzhi, 8th] The landmine warfare behind enemy lines in northern Henan is expanding with the concrete assistance of the Lingchuan Expeditionary Mine Warfare Team. On the night of November 21st, our Qinyang militiamen buried three landmines in a blockhouse that Chiang's puppet troops were rushing to build in Danhepu. The next day, the puppet county magistrate Li Deji went to supervise the construction. As soon as his lackeys entered the blockhouse gate, two mines were triggered, one of them seriously injured. As Li attempted to force his subordinates to continue working, the third landmine exploded. The next day, when Chiang's troops came to investigate, they stumbled upon three landmines secretly planted by our militiamen, which terrified them and foiled their plan to rush the construction of the blockhouse. On the 23rd, after a unit of Jiaozuo militiamen demolished four Chiang's troop's blockhouses on the bank of the Dan River, they anticipated that Chiang's troops would retaliate, so they laid mines by the Gaoyang River, which was their only way to pass. At dawn the next day, more than 70 enemy troops came in two routes. The militiamen waited until they entered the minefield and then suddenly opened fire. The startled Chiang's troops triggered all the landmines, killing three. On the same day, militiamen from a certain unit in Bo'ai cut the power lines on the Jiaozuo-Bo'ai highway and planted three landmines at the junction. The next day, all of Chiang's communication soldiers triggered them, causing the telephone connection between Jiaozuo and Bo'ai to be cut off for several days.

    地雷轰响蒋军魂飞
    豫北敌后到处爆炸
    【本报长治八日电】豫北敌后爆炸运动，得到陵川远征爆炸队的具体帮助，正广泛开展中。上月二十一日夜，我沁阳民兵在丹河铺蒋伪赶修之炮楼内埋雷三颗，次日伪县长李德基前去监工，其喽ｌｕó＠①刚进炮楼大门，即踏响二颗，其中一人负伤甚重，李逆正待驱使其部下继续动工，第三颗地雷又爆炸了。次日蒋军来查时又碰上我们民兵偷埋的三颗地雷，炸的蒋军魂飞魄散，使其赶修炮楼的计划宣告破产。二十三日，焦作民兵一部平毁丹河岸蒋军碉堡四座后，估计蒋军必来报复，乃在其必经之高阳河边设雷。次日拂晓，敌军七十余人果分两路来犯，民兵待其进入布雷区后，突然射击，蒋军惊散触发全部地雷，被炸毙三人。同日，博爱某部民兵在焦、博公路上收割电线后，在接线处设雷三颗，次日为蒋通讯兵全部踏响，致使焦作、博爱间电话中断数日。
