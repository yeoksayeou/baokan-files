　　Wu'an Lin County Postal Workers
    Donate Books to Comfort the Troops
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to fully supply the frontline soldiers with spiritual food, postal workers in Wu'an and Lin County have donated books to comfort the troops. After the staff of the Wu'an Yetao Postal Station received a large number of books and newspapers donated by the New Masses Society to the frontline soldiers on the 21st of last month, they held a staff meeting that night. The staff said: "Recently, we have received a lot of books and newspapers sent to the front lines. We must not only speed up the delivery but also donate books to comfort the troops." They immediately donated fifty books. Some postal workers also donated their usual savings of 5,200 yuan to buy books and newspapers to send to the front lines. In response to the call from the Border Region Government and Chairman Yang for donating books to comfort the troops, the staff of the Lin County Post Office said: "The wounded soldiers at the front need to read books, so we must send them some books!" Each postal worker donated a total of thirty-two books that they usually enjoyed collecting to the front.

    [Another Report] Teachers and students of the First Primary School in Tunliu County, Taiyue, donated money and wrote letters to comfort the frontline soldiers. The 180 teachers and students of the school saved two liang of millet per person per day from November 1st to the 15th, saving a total of two shi and four dou of millet, which was sold for 4,000 yuan in foreign currency. Together with fourteen letters of comfort, they were sent to the Taiyue Military Region for forwarding to the frontline soldiers. In the letter of comfort from student Chen Yaoxiao of the school, he said: "Dear comrades, you are really working too hard. Without you fighting on the front lines, the people in the liberated areas would not be able to live in peace and would not be able to stand up; we children would not be able to study. You have made great contributions! Fight well on the front lines and don't worry about things at home. The mutual aid teams in the autumn harvest and wheat planting are giving priority to your military families to harvest and plant well, before helping others. Please concentrate on fighting the stubborn troops!..."
