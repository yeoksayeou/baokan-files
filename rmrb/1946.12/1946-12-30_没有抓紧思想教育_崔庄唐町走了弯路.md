　　Failure to Grasp Ideological Education
    Cui Village and Tang Town Took a Detour
    [Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Weixian, 28th] The joint struggle of Cui Village in Feixiang and Tang Town West Village took a detour. Cui Village and Tang Town are only half a mile apart. Tang Town is a poor village, and many poor people have farmed land for landlords in Cui Village and worked as hired laborers. The target of the struggle, Cui Fenggang, was a local tyrant who had served as the head of the Fifty-Three Village Corps. Prior to the struggle, Cui Village had not formed a leading core. The head of the farmers' association, Li Guicheng, and the village representative, Cheng Yubin, were both from other villages, and the masses were afraid to follow them. Moreover, Cui Village was the main force, with Tang Town assisting. The representatives of both sides only discussed things through letters before taking action. At the first day's struggle meeting, a victim from Tang Town cursed Cui Fenggang, saying "I'll fuck your grandma." The masses in Cui Village said, "You can hit, but you can't curse." The bad element, Cui Yutian, the deputy director of the farmers' association, seized the opportunity that night to propose not distributing land to Tang Town, provoking conflict between the two villages, and threatened the masses not to follow the director of the farmers' association and the representative. The next day, because Tang Town's children couldn't sing a welcoming song, there was another uproar, further damaging the relationship between the masses of the two villages. Reviewing the reasons for the failure, first, the leadership failed to inspire the masses to unite politically, failed to inspire the class sentiment of the masses, and failed to carry out education about the idea that all poor people are one family; there was no unified leadership organization established; and the leadership lacked the determination to deal with bad elements. Based on the above shortcomings, a new proposal was made to rectify the organization, elect cadres who had contact with the masses, establish a leading core, and strengthen education about the idea that all farmers are one family. After individual consultation, a mass meeting was held, exposing Cui Yutian's series of rumors and sabotage. Only then did everyone's thinking become clear, and it was decided to give Tang Town fifty mu of land. Finally, a joint celebration meeting of the cadres of the two villages was held. The leadership reviewed its own mistakes, and the cadres of Cui and Tang villages competed to review "not recognizing our own people," and said, "Now Lao Jiang is going to attack us. If our two villages don't unite, how can we fight him?"

　　没有抓紧思想教育
    崔庄唐町走了弯路
    【本报威县廿八日电】肥乡崔庄与唐町西村的联合斗争，走了湾路。崔庄与唐町仅隔半里地，唐町是个穷村，不少的穷人给崔庄地主种过地，当过雇工，斗争对象崔凤岗又是当过五十三村团总的恶霸地主。事先崔庄没形成领导核心，农会主任李贵成与村代表程玉斌都是外庄户，群众不敢跟着走。又以崔庄为主，唐町帮办形式，双方代表仅从信件上商讨了一下就开始行动。第一天的斗争会上，唐町苦主骂了崔凤岗一句“日你奶奶”，崔庄群众说：“能打不能骂”，坏分子农会副主任崔玉田，当晚就趁机提出不分给唐町土地，挑起两村矛盾，并威胁群众不准跟着农会主任及代表走。第二天为着欢迎唐町儿童唱歌没唱成，又大闹了一阵，两村群众关系更坏。检讨失败原因，一是领导上没启发群众从政治上团结，没有启发群众的阶级情绪，没有进行天下穷人是一家的教育；没有建立统一的领导机构；一是对坏分子没决心处理。根据以上缺点，重新提出与整顿组织，选出和群众有联系的干部，建立领导核心，加强天下农民是一家的教育，经过个别酝酿，召开了群众大会，揭发了崔玉田一连串的造谣破坏事实，大家才打通了思想，决定送唐町五十亩地。最后召开两村干部联欢会，领导上检讨了自己的错误，崔、唐两村干部争着检讨了“自己人不认自己人”，都说：“现在老蒋要进攻咱们，咱两村不团结起来，怎么和他干呀？”
