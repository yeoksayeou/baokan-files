　　Bo'ai Militia Achieves Brilliant Victories
    Ninety Operations in One Month, Killing, Wounding, and Capturing Over Two Hundred Enemy Troops
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 6th] The militia, which grew up during the Bo'ai liberation movement, has created brilliant achievements in the self-defense war to protect their homes and avenge their grievances over the past month. According to incomplete statistics from the county's Armed Forces Committee, from the time the Chiang troops invaded the territory on October 13th to November 15th, they cooperated with local military corps and fought independently more than ninety times, killing, wounding, and capturing a total of 254 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops, secret agents, and traitors. They rescued 142 family members of our district's village cadres, liberated more than 400 civilian laborers, burned four enemy blockhouses, and protected the transportation of thousands of piculs of grain, as well as a large amount of military supplies and food such as wires, overcoats, leather shoes, cars, and bicycles. The militia guerrilla warfare in this county first started in Dan River and quickly spread throughout the vast rural areas north and south of the Daoqing Road. The armed work team led by Comrade Liu Xiliang from the Sixth District cooperated with the troops to attack villages such as Xuliang and Daxinzhuang, achieving ten victories in ten battles. The puppet district chief, Ge Quanjing, was wounded by our forces and escaped by jumping into the river, and the team protected more than 600 people to transport more than 600 piculs of public grain overnight. The militia in the Fifth District cooperated with the troops to kill and capture more than 70 members of the puppet "Homecoming Corps" in Beizhu Village. The militia in the Second District chased more than 60 fully armed Chiang Kai-shek troops for two miles. In the battle, wherever our militia fought, our army's slogans appeared. More than 30 local despots and secret agents in Nanxi Shang dare not move during the day and gather at night, but were dispersed by our militia. Three landmines exploded in the west gate of the city, and the Chiang's puppets dared not leave the city for three days. On the first day of the tenth lunar month, the "Homecoming Corps" in each village wanted to go home to worship their ancestors and sweep their tombs, taking the opportunity to carry out activities. However, because our militia was everywhere engaged in guerrilla warfare, they did not dare to leave the city and knelt on the city wall to worship their hometown from afar. The road from the city gate to Baishan is only ten miles long, but it has not been repaired to this day, and the Jiao-Bo highway is completely controlled by our militia. At present, the Bo'ai militia is conducting training and military exercises during the gaps in battles, and at the same time, it is taking the initiative to launch an encirclement of Qinghua. The common people say: "We have already confined Chiang Kai-shek (referring to the Chiang troops) in Qinghua city, and one day we will shoot, stab, and cut him to pieces." (Bing Chang)

　　博爱民兵战绩辉煌
    一月作战九十次毙伤俘敌二百余
    【本报长治六日电】博爱翻身运动中生长起来的民兵，在保家复仇的自卫战争中，月余来创建辉煌战绩，据该县武委会不完全统计，从十月十三日蒋军犯境起至十一月十五日止，计配合地方兵团与单独作战共达九十余次，毙伤俘蒋伪、特务、汉奸等共二百五十四名。救出我区村干部家属一百四十二人，解放民夫四百余人，焚敌炮楼四座，掩护运粮数千石，其他电线、大衣、皮鞋、汽车、自行车等各种军用品及食品甚多。该县民兵游击战争首从丹河发起，迅速燃遍道清路南北广大农村。六区刘希良同志率领下的武工队配合部队，首先攻打许良、大辛庄等村，十战十捷，伪区长葛全经被我击伤，跳河而逃，一夜掩护六百余群众抢运回六百多石公粮。五区民兵配合部队于北朱村毙俘伪“还乡团”七十余名。二区民兵追击武装齐全的蒋军六十余人跑了二里路，在战斗中，我民兵打到那里，我军标语即出现在那里。南西尚恶霸特务三十余人白天不敢活动，夜晚集会，遭我民兵击散。城西关爆炸地雷三颗，蒋伪三天未敢出城。阴历十月初一，各村“还乡团”都想回家祭祖扫坟，借机活动，因我民兵到处游击，不敢出城，跪在城上望乡遥祭。城关至柏山公路仅十里长，至今未能修复，焦博公路完全为我民兵控制。现博爱民兵正一面在战斗空隙中进行整训练武，一面主动出击展开围困清化，老百姓说：“咱已把蒋介石（指蒋军）禁闭在清化城，改天就要枪嘣刀砍万刮零”（丙昌）
