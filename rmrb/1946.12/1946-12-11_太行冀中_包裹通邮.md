    Taihang and Jizhong
    Parcel Post Service Opens
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch of the 9th] The Taihang Postal Administration and the Jizhong Postal Bureau have agreed to begin mailing parcels on December 10th to strengthen the connection between the mountainous and plain areas and to serve the military, civilians, and all sectors of society. Postage will be temporarily affixed according to the local currency value.
    [Another dispatch] In order to facilitate market management, the Changzhi Municipal Government and the Public Security and Industry and Commerce Bureaus have specifically designated markets throughout the city for calico, salt, tobacco, fruit, vegetables, meat, bamboo products, meals, and sundry goods. The city streets have now expanded from Upper Street to Middle Street, and the order is well-organized. Schools, factories, and shops are being renovated one after another, and the city's appearance has been greatly improved. The number of travelers has increased sharply, all praising it as the "bustling city amidst the flames of war in Taihang."
