　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 2nd: Due to excessively heavy taxes and levies, buses on the Tianjin-Beijing highway have recently collectively stopped service. The reason is that the Kuomintang authorities began collecting a "road repair fee" from the 16th of last month, charging 50 yuan per ton of goods per kilometer as a "road toll." This means that each bus traveling between Tianjin and Beijing would need to pay 36,000 yuan in "road tolls." Bus owners requested a reduction or exemption from the Highway Bureau, but were refused. As a result, all vehicles operating on the Tianjin-Beijing highway have now ceased service. Normally, about 500 vehicles travel between Tianjin and Beijing daily, mainly because of a lack of train carriages. Major goods rely on these buses for transportation. The cessation of bus service will greatly stimulate the soaring prices in Tianjin and Beijing.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 2nd: Shanghai Report: Recently, credit in the city has been extremely tight, and the stock market crash sharply contrasts with rising prices. Since the exchange rate increased on June 19th, more than 80 large-scale businesses and factories in Shanghai, including securities firms, banks, North-South goods businesses, department stores, and silk businesses, have gone bankrupt. A large number of industrial and commercial enterprises are surviving on loans. According to investigations, many businesses have a capital of only 100 million yuan, while their debts often exceed 1 billion yuan. Monthly profits are not enough to cover interest payments. If this continues, at least 3,000 to 4,000 businesses will go bankrupt by the end of the lunar year. Amidst the rising prices, government-run enterprises are always at the forefront. Postal rates, electricity, tram fares, and train tickets have all increased seven or eight times. The price of flour continues to rise, and oil prices are also fluctuating. The black market is rising steadily and cannot be stopped. The authorities are indifferent to this economic crisis.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 1st: According to the Nanjing Dagang Daily on the 15th, the number of unemployed people in Shanghai in the 24th year of the Republic (1935) was about 500,000, increasing to 530,000 in the 25th year (1936), and further increasing to 700,000 in the 26th year (1937). It dropped to 600,000 in the 27th year (1938). Now, the number of unemployed has soared to 1,353,000 (approximately one-third of the total population of Shanghai), breaking the record for the number of unemployed.

　　蒋政府竟征收“买路钱”
  　平津汽车集体停驶
  　沪市行厂三千家将停业
    【新华社延安二日电】平津公路汽车因捐税奇重，近已集体停驶。缘因国民党当局自上月十六日起征收“修路费”，每吨货物每公里缴纳“买路钱”五十元，如此则平津两地对开汽车每辆即需缴纳“买路线”三万六千元。车户为此曾向公路局要求减免，但遭拒绝。因此现平津公路行驶之车辆已全部停驶。按平津公路平日往返车辆日计五百辆，盖因火车缺乏车皮，大宗物资端赖此项汽车运输。今汽车停驶，对平津物价之暴涨将有极大之刺激。
    【新华社延安二日电】沪讯：近来本市银根奇紧，股票跌风与物价涨风成一尖锐对照。六月十九日汇率提高以来，沪市较大规模的行厂，包括证券号银号南北货业百货业丝绸业等，倒闭者已达八十余家，工商行厂以借债度日者比比皆是。据调查，有许多行厂资本仅一亿元，而负债往往在十亿以上，每月盈余不够付息，如此下去，到旧历年关倒闭者至少将在三四千家以上。在物价涨风中，政府经营的事业总是一马当先，举凡邮资电器电车费、火车票、都涨价七八倍，面粉涨势未止，油价又告波动，黑市节节上升，无法制止。此种经济危机，当局也不闻不问。
    【新华社延安一日电】据南京大刚报十五日载：上海二十四年度失业人数约五十万人，二十五年度增至五十三万人，二十六年度再增至七十万人，二十七年度降至六十万人，现在失业人数飞涨至一百三十五万三千人（约占）全沪市人口三分之一强），突破失业人数记录。
