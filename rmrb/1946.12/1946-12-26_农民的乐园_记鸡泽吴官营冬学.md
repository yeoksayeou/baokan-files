　　The Peasants' Paradise
    ——A Record of the Winter School in Wuguan Village, Jize
    Yi Geng
    On the night of December 6th, this reporter visited the winter school in Wuguan Village, Jize. The winter school in this village has been established for a month. The students here include the two groups of the Farmers' Association, Chen Changhe and Chen Wenzhi, totaling thirty people. Among them, there are five militia members, who are away for concentrated martial arts training. Every night, about twenty people study here.
    In the past, the students had suffered from the oppression and exploitation of feudal landlords and local bullies. Chen Shangkui worked as a hired laborer for fifteen years, Xin Qi worked as a hired laborer for eleven years, and Chen Jinxiang's two uncles worked as hired laborers their whole lives and even starved to death in the famine. Today, they have been emancipated, and everyone is filled with the joy of a new life. The emancipation songs they sing in the winter school are all composed by themselves, accusing their half-lives of suffering and singing of the joy of emancipation. "Old Liu, listen to my song!" When my conversation with them was interrupted, they immediately started singing, "The rich are always rich, the poor are always poor, the lives of the poor and the rich are not the same; the poor family is always suffering, while the rich family enjoys prosperity, hey yo hey. The rich live in tall buildings, the poor live in thatched huts; how can the lives of the poor and the rich be equal! The Communist Party has come to bring down the bullies, only by overthrowing the bullies and landlords can we be emancipated, eliminate the bullies and feudal forces, so that the poor can be liberated and live in peace, hey yo hey." There were many songs, and they sang one after another. As I was talking with the small blacksmith Chen Xincai about his thirty-two years of fleeing from famine, another mournful and tragic song began, "My old father starved to death, the child was sold, my mother went out to beg for food, it's really a bitter story." At this point, Chen Chang whispered to me, "Every time I sing this, I feel sad." Chen Chang was originally a "well-behaved family," working as a servant and tilling the land for others for thirty years. In 1932, he fled to Shanxi due to famine. His mother was sold in Hongtong, and the following year he returned empty-handed with his child. When the lyrics sang "Communist Party Chairman Mao," everyone raised their heads and sang in unison: "The poor want to be emancipated, first we must open our minds; we don't believe in so-called conscience, or fate, it's all fooling people. Workers and peasants unite, emancipation depends on ourselves; brothers, if you help me and I help you, we will certainly carry it through to the end." It was late at night, but everyone still showed no sign of leaving, and the room was filled with laughter and warmth. As I bid farewell to the winter school and walked towards North-South Street, the singing from the winter school on the north side began again.

　　农民的乐园
    ——记鸡泽吴官营冬学
    亦耕
    十二月六日的夜间，记者访问了鸡泽吴管营的冬学。该村冬学成立一个月了，这里的学生包括着农会陈昌和、陈文治两个小组，共三十个人，其中有五个民兵队员，因练武集中学习去了，每晚上有廿来个人在这里学习。
    学员们过去都是饱尝了封建地主恶霸的压迫和剥削的，陈尚魁当过十五年雇工，新起当过十一年雇工，陈金箱的两个伯伯当了一辈子雇工，还饿死在灾荒里。今天翻身了，每个人都获得新生的喜悦。他们在冬学里唱的翻身歌都是自己编的，控诉着半生的苦难，歌唱着翻身的愉快“老刘，你听听俺的歌吧？”当我和他们谈话刚一中断时，紧接着便唱起来，“富人永远富，穷人永远穷，穷富人儿不一般同；穷人治家吗常受罪，富贵哪治家呢常常享荣，咦油咳。富家住高楼，穷人住草棚；穷富人家怎样不平等！共产党来到要把恶霸平，打倒了恶霸地主才能翻身，消灭恶霸封建势力呀，穷人呀得解放才得安生，咦油咳。”歌很多，唱了一个又一个。我正和小炉匠陈信材谈他三十二年歇火逃难的情景时，又一音调哀惋凄惨的歌声起了，“饿死老父亲，孩儿卖给人，老娘呀出外要饭逃荒，说起来真苦情”。唱到这里，陈昌低声向我说：“每唱到这儿，我就伤心。”陈昌本是一个“好受家”，给人做佣人，替人种地，劳动了三十年。三十二年逃荒到山西，老娘卖在洪洞了，第二年他空手拉着孩儿回来。当歌词唱到“共产党毛主席”时，大家便昂起头来，合唱：“穷人要翻身，先要开脑筋；咱不信什么良心，凭命运，净是哄弄人。工农联合起，翻身靠自己；兄弟们，你帮我来我帮你，一定干到底”。夜深了，大家还没有散意，满屋子里是欢笑和温暖的气息。当我从冬学里告辞出来走向南北大街时，北边那座冬学里的歌声又响起了。
