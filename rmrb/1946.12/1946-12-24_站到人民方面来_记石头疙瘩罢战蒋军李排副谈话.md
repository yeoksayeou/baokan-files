　　Standing on the Side of the People
    ——Notes from a Conversation with Li, Deputy Platoon Leader of the Chiang Army Who Ceased Fighting at Shitou Gedda
    Lang Qiao

    Following the Yuanqu Campaign, the reporter interviewed Shao Wenbin, the company commander of the 163rd Regiment, and Li Mincai, the veteran deputy platoon leader, who ceased fighting at Shitou Gedda. Li Mincai was already forty-one years old. In three days, he underwent a great change, suddenly becoming younger and more cheerful. He said, "Two months ago, when we heard the news of the annihilation of the First Brigade in Henan, we were terrified. More than fifty brothers over forty years old were petitioning the superiors for approval to retire and go home to avoid this disaster. Everyone knew that besides the First Brigade, we were the second-best brigade in the world. After the First Brigade was annihilated, Chiang Kai-shek would not let us stay idle in Henan... In early October, we were finally transferred from Henan to Shanxi. After crossing the Yellow River, it seemed as if the bloody ghosts of the First Brigade were haunting us even in our meals and sleep. Only after receiving your leaflets about the preferential treatment of prisoners of war did we feel a little relieved." "When you attacked Yuanqu, the battalion headquarters ordered us to defend Shitou Gedda to the death. Company Commander Shao Wenbin, Deputy Company Commander Feng Shaowen, and the third platoon's artillery squad were all on the eastern position, while the first platoon and heavy machine guns were on the western position. On the 6th, you took Wangmao in twenty or thirty minutes and then surrounded us. With no one to lead, the battalion commander ordered us to defend to the death inside the fortifications. We dared not even peek out of the gun emplacements, waiting quietly for you to deal with us. Platoon Leader Feng Zhanyun and I discussed it. He was the only one in the platoon who graduated from military academy, which was quite an achievement for a soldier like us. I said, 'Old Feng, you've spent more than ten years in the army to become a platoon leader, which is quite rare for someone from our ranks. What else can you hope for in the future? Fighting like this is just throwing our lives away. We'd rather surrender than be taken prisoner!' Feng Zhanyun agreed with my idea and went to find the company commander and deputy company commander. The deputy company commander had been captured by the New Fourth Army before. He agreed to surrender, and the company commander didn't object." "We knew you were building fortifications. In order not to break the peace, the brothers didn't shoot even when they spotted targets. On the 8th, your trenches were dug into our outer trenches, reaching within twenty meters of the machine guns. The sound of digging was very clear, but the brothers didn't move, waiting for you to come and disarm us. I went again to urge the platoon leader to urge the company commander to make a decision, and also openly notified the brothers. The brothers all gave a thumbs-up to show their approval, which shows that the brothers' hearts were all leaning this way." "The platoon leader came back and conveyed the company commander's decision. The company commander said that since everyone was unwilling to fight, he would never let everyone make meaningless sacrifices. Let's all surrender... This made everyone cheer with joy." After Company Commander Shao made his decision, it was precisely when we began our attack. The artillery test-fired six shells at their position. Comrade Bian Zhenshao, a propagandist, and Yang Zicheng, a soldier liberated from Wangmao, felt their way to the eastern position and shouted to the enemy. Li Mincai, an anti-civil war activist on the opposite side, was the first to jump out of the fortifications, waving a white towel over his head. Platoon Leader Feng Zhanyun also held up a piece of white cloth from the fortifications and waved it. The soldiers jumped out one by one, shouting, "Don't fight our own people!" "Support Chairman Mao!" At this time, the same great act occurred on the western position. Instantly, the terrifying battlefield became a gathering place for patriotic soldiers, with countless warm handshakes, greetings, and apologies... Company Commander Shao Wenbin is a man of few words. His home is in Nanpi County, Hebei, which is a liberated area. After coming over, he felt uneasy about our treatment of him, but he solemnly stated: "The action at Shitou Gedda is the beginning of my revolution. From now on, I will always follow the Eighth Route Army." This is not hypocrisy. That very night (the 8th), Company Commander Shao began revolutionary work, rushing to Gaoluo to shout to the enemy. The newly arrived soldiers were even more excited, like the veteran platoon leader, even more firmly expressing that they would make revolution from now on. They said to our soldiers, "We will definitely follow you."

　　站到人民方面来
    ——记石头疙瘩罢战蒋军李排副谈话
    朗樵
    垣曲战役结束后，记者访问在石头疙瘩罢战的一六三团连长邵文彬与老排副李民才。李民才已经是四十一岁的人了，在三天内他经过一个大变化，忽然变得年轻愉快了，他说：“两月前在河南听到第一旅被消灭的消息，可把我们吓坏了，五十多个上四十岁的弟兄，整天呈请上级批准复员，好回家去躲过这个灾难。谁都知道除了第一旅，咱们就是天下第二旅，第一旅被消灭，蒋介石就不会再让咱们在河南闲往着……十月初，我们终于从河南被调到山西来了，过了黄河，仿佛连吃饭睡觉都有第一旅的血鬼纠缠着，以后得到你们优待虏俘的传单，心里头才放下一点。”“你们来攻垣曲，营部命令我们死守石头疙瘩，正副连长邵文彬、冯绍文和三排小炮排，都在东阵地上，一排和重机枪在西阵地上。六日，你们二三十分钟就拿下王茅，又把我们包围起来，没人领导，营长命令死守在工事里，对着枪眼可也不敢向外瞧，静待你们来处理，我和排长冯占云商量，几个排里只有他才是军校出来的，我说：“老冯，干了十几年兵才熬成个排长，就对咱这行伍人来说也算出了例了，往后你还能有啥盼的？这样打下去还不是送死，咱们缴了枪总比当俘虏光荣得多！”冯占云很赞成我的意见，去找连长和副连长，副连长过去被新四军俘虏过，他同意缴枪，连长也不反对。”“你们修工事，我们明知道，为了不失和气，弟兄们发现了目标也不打枪。八日，你们的交通壕挖进我们的外壕，离机枪廿米达，掘挖工事声很清楚，弟兄们不动，等你们来缴枪，我又去催排长要他去催连长下决心，另外公开通知弟兄们，弟兄们都伸出大拇指表示赞成，可见弟兄们的心都往这儿想。”“排长回来传达了连长的决心，连长说既然大家都不愿打，也绝不会叫大家作无价值的牺牲，大家缴枪吧……这可把大家喜的叫起来。”邵连长下决心后，正是我们开始攻击的时候，炮兵向他们阵地试射了六炮，宣传员边振邵同志和从王茅解放出来的士兵杨自成，摸到东阵地上喊话，对面反内战的活动分子李民才，首先跳出工事来，用白手巾在头上兜舞着，排长冯占云也从工事里伸出一块白布摇幌着，士兵们都一个个跳出来喊着：“不打自己人！”“拥护毛主席！”此时西阵地上也发生同样的壮举，顿时恐怖的战场成为爱国军人的欢聚场所，数不清的热诚的握手，慰问、道歉……。邵文彬连长是个好沉默的人，家是河北南皮县，还是解放区，过来后，对我们对他的招待感觉不安，但他郑重的表示：“石头疙瘩的举动是我革命的开始，今后永远跟着八路军走。”这不是虚伪，当天（八日）夜晚，邵连长便开始了革命工作，赶到皋落去喊话，新过来的士兵们更是兴奋，像老排长，甚至更坚定的表示着今后革命了，他们对我们的战士说：“一定跟着你们干下去。”
