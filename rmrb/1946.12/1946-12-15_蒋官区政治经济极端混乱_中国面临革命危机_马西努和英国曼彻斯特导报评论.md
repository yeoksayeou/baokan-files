    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 12th: Moscow Radio on the 11th broadcast a commentary by Soviet commentator Maximo, in "A One-Year Summary of Events in China," quoting the British Manchester Guardian as saying: "If the Kuomintang currently appears to be powerful, it is only because of American financial and military aid. China, two decades ago, due to political and economic crisis, launched a great revolution. Now China has fallen into a similar situation. The Chinese people should find their own way out in this situation." Maximo said, "1946 was a year of Chinese democratic forces opposing civil war, opposing reaction, and striving for peace and democracy. Although the Chinese reactionaries, with the support of American reactionaries, have repeatedly attacked the liberated areas, the reactionaries are now further from their goals than when they began to provoke the civil war! The convening of the National Assembly has not changed this situation in the slightest. The balance of power between the two sides is more unfavorable to the reactionaries and more favorable to the democratic forces than ever before."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 11th: According to a dispatch from London in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 8th: The British liberal newspaper, the Manchester Guardian, was the first to comment on China's "National Assembly." The newspaper's editorial on the 5th first stated that only the Kuomintang and two small parties affiliated with the Kuomintang attended the National Assembly, and neither the Communist Party nor the Democratic League participated. It continued: "China has returned to the political and economic chaos of twenty years ago. Under this situation, China must find its own way out. Is it wise for the United States to continue to support a government that cannot rule, is not necessarily recognized, and is abandoned by its founder, Sun Yat-sen? This question is not only raised by the Soviet Union. Without American support, the Kuomintang can only compromise with other parties, or collapse. Either way, it is beneficial to China." Another report: The December issue of "The World Today," published by the Royal Institute of International Affairs, commented on China's "National Assembly," stating: "The National Assembly's future holds no hope of compromise because its nature is not a representative National Assembly. It should be a historically significant gathering of representatives of all Chinese parties, but the Communist Party and the Democratic League have refused to participate. Now, 85 percent of the representatives attending the National Assembly are from the Kuomintang."

    蒋官区政治经济极端混乱
    中国面临革命危机
    马西努和英国曼彻斯特导报评论
    【新华社延安十二日电】莫斯科十一日广播，苏评论员马西努在“中国事变一年总结”的评论中，引英曼彻斯特导报的话说：“如果国民党目前似乎是有力量，这只是因为美国财政与武装的援助。中国在廿几年前，曾由于政治经济的危机，而掀起了大革命，现在中国又陷入了类似的情况。中国人民应当在这种情况中，找到自己的出路”。马西努说：“一九四六年是中国民主力量反对内战、反对反动、争取和平民主的一年，中国反动派虽在美国反动派支援下再三向解放区进攻，但反动派现在比开始挑起内战时距离其目的更远了！国大的召开，丝毫没改变这种形势，目前双方力量对比，比任何时候都不利于反动派，而有利于民主力量”。
    【新华社延安十一日电】据上海大公报八日载伦敦专电：英国自由派的曼彻斯特导报，第一个评论中国的“国民大会”，该报五日社论首述出席国民大会的只有国民党及两个附属于国民党的小党派，中共和民盟都没有参加。继称：“中国又恢复了二十年前的政治与经济混乱，这种局势下，中国必须自己找出路。关于美国继续支持一个不能实行统治，不一定被人承认的政府，且为其创始人孙中山所遗弃的政党，这种行动是否聪明？提出这种问题的不只是苏联一国。没有美国的支持，国民党只能与别党妥协，要不然就垮台。——无论那一种情形，都是对中国有益的”。又讯：英国皇家国际问题学会出版的《今日世界》杂志十二月号，评论中国的“国大”称：“国大前途没有妥协的希望，因为他的性质，不是代议的国大，它应该是中国各党派代表有历史意义的集会，但是中共与民盟都拒绝参加，现在出席国大的代表百分之八十五是国民党。”
