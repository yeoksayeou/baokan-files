(This article was transmitted by Taiyue on the 24th) After Quwo and Houma were occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the local young and middle-aged people armed themselves to persist in guerrilla warfare, while the old, weak, and women mostly moved to the liberated areas. The democratic government specially loaned 110,000 yuan to organize refugees for production and settlement. Since the beginning of winter, all refugees have participated in transportation and weaving, with enough food and warm clothing. Zhang Siming's family of five, with his son carrying coal and transporting it, and the women weaving, earned a total of 4,700 yuan a month, enough to support themselves. Liu Cuicui, a young woman, whose husband joined the militia to fight guerrillas, took care of her child who was almost one year old, weaving day and night, earning seven dou of millet per month, with a surplus after feeding herself. The democratic government is currently establishing a textile factory, purchasing shuttle machines, and preparing to develop refugee weaving on a large scale.

(This article was transmitted by Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 16th) After Juancheng and Linze were liberated again, the democratic government is actively helping the masses solve difficulties and carrying out post-disaster relief and consolation work. A large number of cadres were assigned to investigate in the city and villages in the urban area. Those who were unable to live after being looted by Chiang Kai-shek's troops were temporarily given 10 to 30 jin of millet per person to relieve their immediate hunger. Within two days in Juancheng, more than 2,000 jin of millet and more than 3,000 jin of firewood have been distributed in the city, solving the immediate hunger of 300 people. Seventeen severely affected households in Dazhangzhuang were given 825 jin of millet, saving more than 50 people. Other villages affected by the Chiang Kai-shek disaster are currently being investigated and given relief.

    【本报太岳廿四日电】曲沃侯马被蒋军侵占后，当地青壮年武装起来坚持游击战争，老弱及妇女则多转入解放区。民主政府特贷款十一万元，组织难民生产安家。入冬以来，所有难民均参加运输、纺织，食饱穿暖。张思明全家五口人，自己的儿子担煤运输，女人纺织，一月中共赚洋四千七百元，生活可以自足。青年妇女刘翠翠的丈夫参加民兵打游击，她一人带着快满一岁的孩子，日夜纺织，每月可赚七斗小米，除自食外还有剩余。民主政府目前并设立纺织工厂，购买拉梭机，准备大量发展难民纺织。
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】鄄城、临泽重获解放后，民主政府正积极帮助群众解决困难，进行善后救济慰问工作。分配大批干部到城内及城区各村进行调查，对被蒋军抢掠后无法生活者，即每人暂发给小米十斤至三十斤，以救眼前之饥饿。鄄城两天内，城内已发二千余斤小米，柴三千多斤，解决三百人眼前的饥饿。大张庄十七家受重灾难者，发给小米八百二十五斤，救活五十余人。其他受蒋灾之村庄，现正进行调查救济中。
