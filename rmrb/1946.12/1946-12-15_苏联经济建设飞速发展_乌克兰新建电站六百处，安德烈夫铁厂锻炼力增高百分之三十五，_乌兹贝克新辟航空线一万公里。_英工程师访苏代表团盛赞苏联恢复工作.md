Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 12th: TASS reports: The Soviet post-war economic construction is developing rapidly. The railway department completed its annual plan in early December. The iron bridges destroyed on major rivers have been repaired, and the volume of freight on the western and southern railway lines has increased by 30% compared to last year. The rural areas of Ukraine, which are being restored, have been greatly electrified. Six hundred new power stations have been built in the past twelve months, and 1,500 villages have electrical equipment. The development of the iron and steel industry is also astonishing. After the restoration of the twenty electric smelting furnaces at the Moscow Andreyev Factory, the smelting capacity has increased by 35% to 40%, and 200 watts of electricity can be saved annually. The large-scale opening of air routes is one of the new features after the war. The Uzbek Republic has opened 30 new air routes this year. The total length of air routes in the area is 10,000 kilometers, and 126,000 passengers have traveled this year, three times more than last year. The development of the timber industry has greatly increased the production of by-product chemicals. The production of resin has increased by 60% compared with last year, and tung oil has increased by 32%. Population reproduction is progressing at an unparalleled speed. Since the Supreme Soviet promulgated the decree on strengthening the state's love for mothers and children, the birth rate in the Moscow region has increased by 50% in the past 30 months, and the mortality rate has been greatly reduced.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 12th: TASS Moscow: A delegation from the British Engineering Joint Trade Union recently visited the Donets coal mining area and returned to Moscow, praising the Soviet restoration work, saying: "We did not realize the extent of the German fascists' ravages in the Soviet Union until we witnessed it with our own eyes. Your power stations were particularly badly damaged, but the power stations we visited have been repaired and are generating electricity smoothly. There are plenty of electric lights and electricity for industrial use everywhere. Considering the achievements of the Soviet leaders and workers in such a short period of time, it is really surprising. We have also seen newly repaired factories producing machines, open-hearth furnaces, and blast furnaces that are "smelting iron and steel." This process of restoration proves that the Soviet people and workers have infinite power and the talent to overcome barbaric atrocities."

    苏联经济建设飞速发展
    乌克兰新建电站六百处，安德烈夫铁厂锻炼力增高百分之三十五，
    乌兹贝克新辟航空线一万公里。
    英工程师访苏代表团盛赞苏联恢复工作
    【新华社延安十二日电】据塔斯社讯：苏战后经济建设工作飞速发展。铁路部门已于十二月初完成其一年计划，各大河流被破坏的铁桥已经修好，西方和南方的铁路干线运货量较去年增加百分之三十。正在恢复中的乌克兰农村已大大电汽化，过去十二个月内已新建发电站六百处，一千五百个村庄已有电汽设备。冶铁业的发展亦甚惊人，莫斯科安德烈夫厂的二十座电力冶铁炉修复后，锻炼力较前增高百分之三十五至四十，且每年可节省电力二百瓦。航空线的大量开辟是战后新特征之一，乌兹贝克共和国本年内便开辟了三十条新航线，该地航空线总长一万公里，今年搭客十二万六千人，较去年增加三倍。木材业的发达使副产化学品的产量大为增加。树脂的出产与去年比较增加百分六十，桐油增加百分之三十二。人口的繁殖以无比的速度前进。自最高苏维埃颁布加强国家对母亲与儿童的爱护法令后，三十个月来，莫斯科州的生殖率增加了百分之五十，死亡率则大为减少。
    【新华社延安十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：英工程师联合职工会代表团，最近访顿尼茨煤矿区返莫斯科，赞扬苏联的恢复工作说：直到我们亲眼目击之后才知道德国法西斯在苏联蹂躏范围之大，以前简直无法想像。你们的发电站被破坏得特别惨，但我们所到之处发电站均已修复，且顺利发电，到处都有充分的电灯和电力供工业使用。想一想在这样短促的时间内，苏联领袖及工人的这种成就实令人惊讶不置。我们又看见新修恢的工厂已出产机器敞口炉和鼓风炉已在“炼铁和钢”。这种恢复的进程，证明苏联人民及工人具有无穷的力量以及克服野蛮暴行的才干。
