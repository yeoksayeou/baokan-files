(Taiyue, December 18th) This time, Chiang's troops transferred the 31st Brigade from the Tongpu Railway Line to reinforce the Jiang-Yuanqu Highway. Yuanqu County, which was liberated by our army, was reoccupied by Chiang's troops on the morning of the 11th. The reporter interviewed local people about this, proving that the people of Yuanqu have full confidence in victory and fighting will. Middle peasant Wang Jinren said, "Let's take a step back, as long as there are people, there is land. If he increases his troops in Yuanqu, other places will become weaker. If the Eighth Route Army goes to other places to attack, after a few attacks, Chiang Kai-shek only has a few 'balls' left, won't they be finished? The city will be ours sooner or later!" Poor peasant Che Yunfang, who participated in the liberation of Yuanqu, said, "The Eighth Route Army's plan is brilliant. This time, it has pinned down several thousand of his troops. When the day comes to eliminate them, they will be eliminated. This time, the 'revenge squads' organized by the Chiang's troops with a bunch of traitors, evil gentry, and escaped feudal landlords were wiped out. When Chiang's troops come, it's like being trapped in a drum, with no one to inform them. The Eighth Route Army can concentrate a large army to eliminate them." Militia member Hou Chunyue said, "Our people have all risen up. We have militia, district cadres, and independent battalions. When Chiang Kai-shek comes, we will fight him." This is the strategic thinking of the masses, this is strength. They have no sense of failure at all. On the contrary, they have now entered a stage of clearing the fields and checking, and are actively launching guerrilla warfare in conjunction with local troops.

　　蒋军增援再陷垣曲城
    当地人民斗志更坚
    【本报太岳十八日电】此次蒋军从同蒲线抽调三十一旅，增援绛垣公路，被我解放之垣曲县城，十一日晨再为蒋军侵占。记者为此访问当地群众，证明垣曲人民有充分胜利信心和斗争意志，中农王近仁说：“缓后一步再说，有人就有土，他的兵增加到垣曲，别的地方就薄了，八路军再到别的地方去搞，三搞两搞，蒋介石就是那几个‘球’人不也就搞光了？城池迟早是咱们的！”曾参加解放垣曲战役的贫农车运方说：“八路军的计划就是高，这一次又吸住他几千人马不能动。说那一天消灭他，就能消灭了，这次把蒋军收的一罗窝汉奸恶霸，逃亡的封建地主组织的‘复仇队’一网打尽，蒋军来了就像闷到鼓里一样，没人给他通风报信，八路军就能集中大军把他消灭掉。”民兵侯春玉说：“咱老百姓都起来了，有民兵、区干队、独立营，蒋介石来，咱就和他干。”这就是群众的战略思想，就是力量，他们并无一点失败情绪，相反的现已进入空室清野检查，结合地方兵团积极展开游击战争。
