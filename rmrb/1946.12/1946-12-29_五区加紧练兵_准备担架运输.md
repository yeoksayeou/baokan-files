　　Fifth District Intensifies Military Training
    Prepares Stretcher Transport
    [Another Dispatch] The Fifth District of the county has established district and village command posts and is actively carrying out military training. The masses are actively storing grain, proposing "Not to let the Chiang troops grab a single grain of food," and "Wherever the Chiang troops attack, let them die there." In villages where the fruits of labor have not yet been distributed, the masses are actively clearing and distributing them in conjunction with war preparations, and holding座谈会 with those who were struggled against and the masses, calling on peasants and landlords to cooperate in resisting the invading Chiang troops. In terms of ideological education, the masses' sense of complacency has been transformed, and stretchers and transportation teams have been fully prepared. The district already has more than 900 livestock and more than 3,500 stretcher bearers participating in the Jilu豫 front. Not a single member of the stretcher team has run back. After the Sixth District militia held "think-think meetings," they shattered their complacency. Everyone unanimously swore to sleep together, stand guard, and strictly prevent special agent activities. They will practice martial arts well in the morning and evening, and under no circumstances will they surrender or hand over their weapons. They will fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end. When the Chiang troops invade, they will not go far away, but will persist in defending their district, fighting guerrilla warfare and mine warfare, so that the enemy will die on our land.

　　五区加紧练兵
    准备担架运输
    【又讯】该县五区建立了区村指挥部，积极开展了练兵运动，群众正积极藏粮，提出“不让蒋军抢走一粒粮”，“蒋军进攻到那里，就叫他死在那里”。未分清果实的村，群众结合备战，正积极清理分配，并召开被斗户与群众座谈会，号召农民与地主合作抵抗进犯蒋军。在思想教育上，转变了群众的麻痹思想，充分准备了担架和运输队。该区已有九百多牲口，三千五百多担架队员，参加了冀鲁豫前线，担架队没有一个跑回的，六区民兵经“想想会”后，打破了麻痹思想，大家一致宣誓，要集体睡觉，站岗放哨，严防特务活动。早晨和晚上好好练武，在任何情况下不投降、不缴枪，与蒋介石干到底，蒋军侵犯过来不远走，坚持本区，打麻雀战，地雷战，叫敌人死在咱这块地上。
