    The Taihang Experience in Organizing Winter Production
    This Newspaper Research Office
    (1) Winter Production is a Mass Demand
    The 1945 winter production campaign in the Taihang area gave us an important insight: winter production is a mass demand. Wherever the leadership paid attention to this demand and consciously organized the work, that place achieved results. Zhou Liyou, a labor hero from Huguan, turned his life around during the rent reduction campaign in 1944. In the autumn of 1945, he harvested nine *shi* and eight *dou* of grain for the first time. However, after doing the math, he realized that new cotton clothes for his family of five would cost six *shi* and two *dou* of grain. He resolved to engage in transportation himself, while his wife spun cotton to solve the problem. His calculations immediately motivated the entire village to organize winter transportation and textile production. In Jiangtang Village, Yushe, after the autumn harvest of 1945, because most farmers had received land and had a good harvest, the idea of winter idleness was widespread. Everyone wanted to stay at home, warm and comfortable, and get through the winter. However, after calculations, it was discovered that the grain they harvested was not enough to achieve the goal of "cultivating three and having a surplus of one," and many people could not afford seasonal clothing, which aroused the production enthusiasm of the masses. The experiences of countless villages prove that as long as a group or a hero takes the lead, breaks the idea of winter idleness through specific calculations, and gains experience and earns money, the masses will quickly organize themselves. Especially in areas with experience in organizing, such as Licheng, by the end of January, small-scale cooperatives organized by the masses themselves had grown to 333, with more than 20,000 participants, and Ping shun had more than 200. This situation is not only in the old areas. In the Wuzhi New District, in November 1945, more than 200 villages requested loans for textile production. In the 47 villages of Mozhuang and others, more than 1,000 women were organized to spin and weave. These facts can help us affirm a concept: farmers who have escaped feudal exploitation are eager to establish their own family businesses – even in areas with abundant labor and affluent people. When the masses realize and calculate the simple truth that today production and becoming rich is for themselves, and in the past they struggled to pay debts and live a busy life for the landlords, they will actively engage in production, and they have the same demand in winter. The peasants who have turned over, every family has some surplus grain and money, plus idle labor, which is the capital for production. The question is how to use it. To organize, so that wealth regenerates wealth. If done well, it can not only lay a material foundation for next year's large-scale production campaign (no worries about food, clothing, and use), but also the experience of production organization will be of great help to next year's production.
    (2) Organize Winter Production
    The content of winter production is diverse: textile, transportation, oil extraction, flour mills, gristmills, saltpeter production... and preparing for next year's production, such as building embankments, accumulating fertilizer, gathering firewood, and so on. Taking textile as an example, to do it well, it is not enough to organize women to spin and weave. It is also necessary to solve the source of cotton. Cotton-producing areas must organize cotton ginning, cotton batting, and weaving into cloth, and then sell it to exchange for raw materials. This requires solving the transportation problem... In short, it is difficult for a few people to do it. Considering the conditions of the farmers who have just turned over, some have capital but lack manpower, while others have manpower but lack technology... Allowing it to drift on its own will still disadvantage the poor peasants. Shexian had villages that reflected last year: "Rich people do business, leaving only poor people to do errands." Guo Qunze and other seven people from Chuandi Village, Pingshun, bought four or five *jin* of cotton each time they went to Linxian. Because they were not organized and each took care of themselves, all seven went to sell cotton. They sold three *jin* in one day, wasting a lot of manpower. When they went to Ren Village to sell millet to buy cotton, because they were not organized, they competed with each other. Goods were often rushed in at once, and they often couldn't get a good price for their goods all day. After reviewing these lessons and organizing, they made a lot of money. Therefore, organizing winter production is even more urgent than agricultural cultivation. Letting it drift is wrong. We must affirm the idea of organizing from the ideological point of view. Some places in Taihang suffered from self-flow last year, and should not repeat the same mistakes this year.
    Secondly, in terms of the form and method of organization, the small-scale cooperatives that Pingshun, Licheng, and other places in Taihang summarized last year are organizations that come from the masses and truly serve the masses. They not only promoted winter production, but also continued in many places and organized sideline production during this year's agricultural production season. The sources and experiences of this organization can be summarized as follows:
    First, the development process of small-scale cooperatives: Taking Yangjingdi in Pingshun as an example: First, a mutual aid group of ten households collectively took out wheat to grind flour in the gaps when weeding the land. In twenty days, after deducting labor costs, each household earned an average of 440 yuan. After the autumn harvest, the whole group extracted five old men to grind flour, and the rest organized transportation and wool spinning. When villagers saw the benefit, they came to participate, and it expanded to 46 households, gradually becoming a small-scale cooperative for wool spinning and transportation. The whole group had 34 full laborers. One person was extracted to be stationed in Ren Village to be responsible for pushing and selling goods, and six people ran back and forth to collect wool spinning raw materials. The women in the group also united with women outside the group to spin wool. After working like this for a month, they made a summary. When they spoke about it in the winter school, the whole village rose up. Based on the same method, they developed six small-scale cooperatives, with more than 80% of the masses participating. The business developed to include opening shops, selling food, and opening oil presses, etc., six types. In 40 days, the whole village's income was nearly 250,000 yuan, with an average income of more than 10,000 yuan per household. Another type is based on mutual aid teams. Taking Liu Chunbao's team in Dong'anju, Piancheng, as an example, after entering winter, the whole team proposed the slogan of doing whatever they could do. According to different abilities of each person, they voluntarily and automatically organized transportation, manure making, firewood gathering, and textile production groups, and then unified the calculation of work points and converted work points according to different abilities and different incomes.
    Although the situations in various places are slightly different, generally speaking, they are all voluntarily combined according to the needs of the masses to organize manpower and financial resources, and then carry out division of labor according to ability and technology, in order to achieve the goal of making the best use of people's talents and making the best use of financial resources. The degree of organization and the development situation vary from place to place, but none of them has deviated from this general principle.
    Second, how small-scale cooperatives organize capital and people with different skills and different labor to calculate work points and convert shares and fairly distribute dividends: The method of converting work points in Nihekou Village, Yushe: Carrying 60 *jin* a day is one work point, splitting 50 *jin* of firewood is one work point, grinding four tables of tofu is one work point... calculated according to the work done, every three work points is one share, and 50 yuan is one share. Dividends are distributed according to labor accounting for 80% and capital accounting for 20%. The workshops under the Qingcao Hui Cooperative in Pingshun adopt the method of earning wages. The remaining profits after deducting wages and all expenses are divided according to different proportions of labor accounting for 60% and capital accounting for 40%, labor accounting for 70% and capital accounting for 30%, and labor accounting for 80% and capital accounting for 20% (determined according to the weight ratio of labor and capital paid). The methods in various places are roughly the same in spirit, and will not be listed one by one.
    Third, democratic leadership and a diligent accounting system: In principle, it is completely voluntary and there is freedom to enter and exit (labor shares and money shares are the same). Some calculate accounts every time they do a transaction. This is exactly what large cooperatives found difficult to do in the past, but small-scale cooperatives solved it.
    Fourth, the issue of business leadership of small-scale cooperatives. The core of this issue is that after a large number of small-scale cooperatives have developed, it is easy to produce blindness and speculation. In Tongtan Town, Zuoquan, four flour mills developed last year alone, resulting in the collapse of two. In the purchase and sale of goods, they often stop what the masses most urgently need in pursuit of profit. How to guide and organize the development of small-scale cooperatives in terms of business is still a major issue that needs to be better resolved in this year's campaign.
    In short, the cooperative movement is the link to carry out winter production. Without this move, everything is out of the question. Past cooperatives that were divorced from the masses still need to learn from the development experience of small-scale cooperatives, examine the past, and seek improvement, in order to better combine with small-scale cooperatives to carry out winter production work.
    (3) Leadership Issues
    The key to carrying out winter production basically depends on the leadership. Judging from last year's experience, there are the following issues:
    First, the issue of arranging winter production work: In past years, the winter tasks have been busy and urgent. Last year, in the three months of winter in the Taihang area, there were the following tasks: rent reduction, participating in the war, joining the army, winter school, voluntary transportation, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, production... Because many tasks are urgent - such as rent reduction, participating in the war, joining the army, etc., it is easy for the leadership to put winter production in the last place or hand it over to the production organs. In many areas, winter production is allowed to flow freely. This is the basic reason. To solve this problem, in addition to clarifying that winter production is a mass demand and must be organized and led, it is also necessary to solve the problem of combining it with other work. Last year, Pingshun had the experience of organizing rent reduction in production. People who did not turn over in the organization of production are easily revealed. Specific investigation reveals problems. If rent reduction has come to an end, and it is not timely to turn to production, too long entanglement will lose direction. Experience has proved that after rent reduction is basically completed, we should immediately turn to production, and combine the implementation of rent reduction. As long as the leadership is willing to go deep, problems can also be found in production. In addition, in the combination of errands and voluntary transportation with production, there were two methods last year: One is to combine organizing errands with going to the field to buy back necessities, and organizing livestock to return without being empty. The other is to unify the calculation of work points for errand transportation, allocating a portion of people to run errands, and allocating work points to transportation personnel. The errands in a war situation can be solved by this method. In the combination of winter school and production, many areas last year adopted the method of organizing winter school by production units. Some winter schools in Tongtan hold classes in workshops, with fire and lights, and the masses can also combine inspection and help the production of the workshops. Others bring the topics in the winter school to the road of transportation for discussion, which has also received good results.
    Second, break the idea of winter idleness: The masses have the demand for winter production, but it does not mean that there is no idea of winter idleness. The responsibility of the leaders lies in guiding the masses to overcome their weaknesses and develop the side that is truly beneficial to the masses. The idea of winter idleness is more serious in richer areas, and it is more difficult for cadres to see the active side of the masses. The way Taihang broke the idea of winter idleness last year was to use the method of calculating accounts, that wearing a single layer of clothing costs the grain of one *mu* of land, which easily hits the hearts of the masses and inspires the active side of production. This experience can be universally used in all places, but as long as the leadership can still find factors that motivate the masses to actively demand production and become rich and promote them, this problem can be solved.
    Third, the issue of preparing for next year's production: Many areas in Taihang that developed well in small-scale cooperation last year ignored this work. When spring plowing had already begun, many places had not yet turned around, and felt that doing business was more profitable than farming and were unwilling to turn around, delaying spring plowing. The leadership must pay attention to this early. The following methods were done well in Taihang last year: First, organize a portion of people to do long-term preparation in winter production, such as Liu Chunbao's team in Dong'anju, Piancheng, who specifically had people to accumulate fertilizer and gather firewood for a long time. Second, concentrate all efforts to make a sudden preparation in a certain period of time - such as Zizhen in Licheng, who fermented more than 1,200 *tuo* of manure in the seven days before the start of winter production, and then relied on oil presses and stuffed pancakes, so that the average village could apply 40 *tuo* of manure per *mu*. Wei Laixing's team in Shiyan, Pingshun, first built embankments and repaired dams with more than 200 work points before the start of winter production, and then carried out other production after the completion of the raid. Third, when the spring plowing production season comes, we must resolutely turn around, leaving a portion of people to engage in sideline production, and their land is exchanged by mutual aid teams, and most people resolutely turn to production. This requires the leadership to persuade the masses ideologically early, in order to achieve it.

    太行组织冬季生产的经验
    本报研究室
    （一）冬季生产是群众要求
    一九四五年太行区的冬季生产运动，曾给了我们一个重要启示：冬季生产是群众要求，那个地方领导上注意这个要求，并有意识的进行了组织工作，那个地方就取得了成绩。壶关劳动英雄周里有在四四年查减中翻了身，四五年秋季第一次自己收到了九石八斗粮，但算了个账全家五口人换个一表新的棉衣就得六石二斗粮。决心自己搞运输，老婆纺花来解决。他算的账马上推动了全村，有组织的开展了冬季运输纺织。榆社讲堂村四五年秋收后，因农民大部得到土地而且收成不坏，因而冬闲思想很普遍，都想在家里暖暖和和过个冬。但后来经过计算，打的粮食不仅做不到耕三余一，而且很多人无力换季，从而激起了群众的生产热情。无数村庄的经验证明：只要一个小组或者一个英雄开了头，经过具体计算，打破了冬闲思想，并取得了经验赚了钱，群众很快就纷纷组织起来了。特别是已有了组织起来经验的地区，如黎城到一月底群众自己组织起来的小型合作社发展到三百三十三个，参加人数二万余，平顺发展到二百多个。这个情况不仅在老区，武陟新区在四五年十一月份，就曾有二百余村要求贷款纺织，仅在磨庄等四十七个村就组织了一千多妇女纺织。这些事实可以帮助我们肯定一个观念：摆脱了封建剥削的农民，迫切要求建立自己家务——在劳力充足人民生活富裕的地区也不例外。当群众体会与计算到今日生产发家是为自己，过去挨债渡日生活忙迫是为地主这个简单的道理后，就要积极生产，冬季也有同样要求。翻身后的农民，那家都有些余粮余钱，加上闲散着的劳力，就是生产的资本。问题就在于怎样去运用它。要组织起来，使得财富再生财富，做得好不仅可以为来年的大生产运动奠定物质基础（不愁吃、穿、用），而且生产组织的经验，对来年生产将有极大帮助。
  （二）组织起来开展冬季生产
    冬季生产的内容是多种多样的：纺织、运输、榨油、粉坊、磨坊、硝坊……以及为来年生产做准备的垒堰、积肥、打柴等等。就拿纺织一项来说要做得好，不仅要组织妇女纺花织布，还要解决棉花来源问题，产花的地区就要组织轧花、弹花、织成布还要卖出去换回原料，这就要解决运输问题……。总之，少数人难以举办。再就才翻身农民的条件讲，有的是有资本缺人力，有的又是有人力缺技术……任其自流，吃亏的还是贫农。涉县去年有的村就有这样反映：“有钱人做买卖，只留下穷人去支差。”平顺川底村郭群则等七人下林县一次都买回四、五斤花，因各顾各没有组织，七人都去卖花，一天卖了三斤，浪费人力甚大，到任村卖小米买棉花，因为没组织，彼此竞争，货物一下拥来常常等一天买卖货都遇不上个好价钱。检讨了这些教训组织起来之后，大大赚钱。由此可知，冬季生产的组织起来。甚至比农业耕作还显得迫切。自流放任是错误的，必须从思想上肯定组织起来的观念。太行有些地方去年吃了自流的亏，今年当勿再蹈覆辙。
    其次在组织的形式与方法上讲，太行平顺、黎城等地去年所总结的小型合作社，是从群众中来而又真正为群众服务的组织，不仅推动了冬季生产而且不少地方继续下来，组织了今年农业生产季节中的副业生产，这一组织来源及经验，综合讲有以下几点：
    第一是小型合作社发展的过程：以平顺羊井底为例：首先是从一个互助组十户集体拿出麦子在锄罢地的空隙里磨面，二十天工夫除了脚价，平均每户得利四百四十元。秋后全组抽出五个老汉磨面，其余人组织运输、纺羊毛。村人看到有利来参加便扩大到了四十六户，逐渐便成为纺毛运输的小型合作社了。全组三十四个全劳力，抽出一个人常驻任村负责推货卖货，有六个人来回跑并收买纺毛原料。其他能担的担能运的运，组内妇女并团结组外妇女进行纺毛。就这样干了一个月，做了个总结，在冬学里一讲，全村就都起来了，依据同样办法发展到六个小型合作社，参加群众到百分之八十以上，业务发展到开店、卖饭、开油坊等六种。四十天内全村收入近二十五万元，平均每户即收入到万余元。还有一种是以互助队为基础开展起来的，以偏城东安居刘春保队做例，他们在进入冬季后全队提出能干啥就干啥的号召，根据各人不同能力自愿自动组织了运输扁担、造粪、打柴、纺织等小组，而后再按不同能力不同收入统一计工折工。
    各地情况虽略有不同但总起来讲，都是按群众要求自愿结合组织人力财力，再按能力技术进行分工，以达到人尽其财，财尽其利的目的。各地组织起来程度不同，发展情况亦有不同，但都没有出了这个总的原则。
    第二是小型合作社把资本与不同技术、不同劳力的人组织到一起怎样进行计工折股。公平分红的问题：榆社泥河口村折工办法：一天担六十斤为一工，刨柴五十斤为一工，磨豆腐四桌为一工……按活计工，每三工为一股，钱五十元为一股，按劳八资二分红。平顺青草回合作社所属作坊系采取赚工资办法，除工资及一切开支外所余红利按劳六资四，劳七资三，劳八资二等不同比例分红（根据劳力与资本所支付之轻重比来确定）。各地办法，精神大体相同，不再一一列举。
    第三是民主领导与勤算账制度：在原则上是完全自愿而且有进出自由（劳力股金都一样），有的每做一次买卖算一次账，这点正是过去大合作社难办的，小型合作社把他解决了。
    第四是小型合作社的业务领导问题，这个问题的中心是小型合作社大量发展起来后，很容易产生盲目性投机性，左权桐滩镇去年单粉坊就发展了四家，结果挤垮了两家。在买卖货物上也常常因追逐营利，而把群众最迫切需要的东西停下来。怎样从业务上指导与组织小型合作社的发展还是个大问题，需要从今年的运动中求得更好解决。
    总之，合作运动是开展冬季生产的纽带，没有这一着，一切无从说起，过去脱离群众的合作社还需依据小型合作社的发展经验，检查过去，求得改进，以便与小型合作社结合更好的开展冬季生产工作。
  （三）领导问题
    冬季生产开展的关键，基本决定于领导。从去年的经验看，有以下几个问题：
    第一是冬季生产工作的安排问题：历年的情况都是冬季任务较忙迫，去年太行区冬三月中有以下的工作：查减、参战、参军、冬学、义运、拥军优抗、生产……由于有许多任务是迫不及待的——如：查减、参战、参军等，因此在领导上就很容易把冬季生产排在第末位或交给生产机关去做，许多地区，冬季生产形成自流，这是基本原因。解决这个问题除从基本上明确冬季生产是群众要求，必须进行组织领导外，还须解决一个与其他工作结合问题。去年平顺有过在生产中组织查减的经验，在组织生产中没有翻身的人很容易显露出来，具体调查，就发现了问题。如果查减已告一段落，而不及时转向生产，过长纠缠就会迷失方向，经验证明：查减基本上完成应即转入生产，结合贯彻查减只要领导上肯于深入，在生产中同样可以发现问题。此外在支差义运与生产的结合上，去年有两种办法：一种是组织支差与到地头买回必需品结合，组织牲口不空返回。还有一种是支差运输统一计工，拨出一部分人支差，与参加运输人员拨调工，在一个战争情况下的差务，是大体可以按这种方法解决的。冬学与生产的结合上去年不少地区采取以生产单位组织冬学的办法，桐滩有的冬学在作坊里上课，有火有灯，群众还可结合检查与帮助作坊的生产。还有的是把冬学里的题目，带到运输的路上讨论，也曾收到好的效果。
    第二是打破冬闲思想：群众有冬季生产的要求，但并不等于没有冬闲思想，领导者的责任正在于引导群众克服弱点，发展真正与群众有利的一面。冬闲思想在越富足的地区就越严重，干部也就越不容易看到群众积极的一面。太行去年打破冬闲思想的办法是用算账办法，穿一身单衣就得一亩地的粮食，很容易打中群众的心，启发积极生产的一面。这一经验各地方一定能普遍运用，但只要领导上还能找到群众积极要求生产发家的因素加以发扬，这个问题是可以得到解决的。
    第三是为来年生产做准备的问题：去年太行不少小型合作发展较好的地区，忽视了这一工作，到春耕业已开始，还有许多地方转不过来，觉得做买卖比种地赚钱而不愿转，把春耕拖下来，领导须及早注意到这一着。去年太行做得好的地方有以下几种办法：第一是在冬季生产中组织一部分人来做长期准备，如偏城东安居刘春保队专门有人长期积肥、打柴。第二是在一定时期内集中全力突击准备——如黎城子镇在冬季生产开始前七天中沤粪一千二百余驮，再靠油坊馅饼，全村每亩平均能上粪四十驮。平顺石岩魏来兴队，冬季生产开始前先垒堰修坝用二百余工，突击完成后再进行其他生产。第三是到了春耕生产季节就要坚决转，留下一部分人专门搞副业，他们的土地由互助组换工种，大部分人坚决转入生产，这就需要领导上及早说通群众思想，才能做到。
