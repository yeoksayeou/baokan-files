Thirty-first Anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising
    *People's Daily* Reference Room

    Thirty-one years ago today, the Yunnan National Protection Army raised the banner of righteousness and declared that the great dictator Yuan Shikai and his "Hongxian" empire should be destroyed.

    The situation at the time was as follows:

    On the one hand, Yuan Shikai, representing the interests of the reactionary landlords and big bourgeoisie, stole the fruits of the Xinhai Revolution and used various methods to destroy the democratic movement of the liberal bourgeoisie. On March 20th of the second year of the Republic of China, he assassinated Song Jiaoren, who advocated a "party cabinet to supervise the president." On May 23rd, he bombed Xu Baoshan. On April 26th, he signed the "Post-War Loan Contract" with the banking groups of England, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan, preparing for civil war. From July to September, he suppressed the Kuomintang's "Second Revolution" organized by Sun Yat-sen in Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Sichuan, Nanjing, and Xuzhou. On October 10th, he bought his way into becoming the official president. On November 4th, he ordered the dissolution of the Kuomintang and revoked the Kuomintang members in the parliament. On January 4th of the third year of the Republic of China, he dissolved the parliament. On January 28th, he dissolved the provincial assemblies. On May 1st, he promulgated the "New Covenant Law" of the pro-government "Central Political Conference." On May 9th of the fourth year of the Republic of China, he signed the traitorous Twenty-One Demands with Japan. Soon after, his henchmen, such as Yang Du, initiated the "Chouan Society" to prepare for the imperial system, and fabricated some "public opinions" bought with money and "petitions" from beggars and prostitutes. Finally, on December 12th, he tore off his "democratic" disguise and nakedly ascended the throne of autocracy.

    On the other hand, the weak national bourgeoisie, after realizing that compromise with Yuan was a deception, began to notice that they would inevitably be isolated and destroyed after selling out the people of the whole country, and turned to actively organizing the anti-Yuan and anti-imperialist movement. Although Sun Yat-sen's "Second Revolution" was suppressed, what followed was the widespread anti-Yuan uprising that began on December 25th of the fourth year of the Republic of China. The Yunnan National Protection Army, led by Cai E and Tang Jiyao, took the lead and dispatched troops in three routes to the borders of Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi. Immediately following was the independence of Guizhou on January 27th of the fifth year of the Republic of China, and the attack on the Yuan army in Hunan and Guangdong by Lu Rongting, Liang Qichao, Chen Bingkun and other troops in Guangxi on February 15th. On April 5th, the Guangdong "Long Family Army" rose up against Yuan under siege on all sides. Provinces such as Zhejiang, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Shandong responded one after another. Even the envoys of imperialist countries and Yuan Shikai's own favorite student, Chen Huan, had to demand Yuan Shikai's abdication at this time.

    In such an extremely isolated situation, Yuan Shikai was not only forced to abolish the imperial system, but the "living sin" of the "hundred-day emperor" sent him to the grave.

    Yuan Shikai is dead, but today, thirty-one years later, "Yuan Shikai"-type dictatorial figures have taken his old path. Although today's Yuan Shikai is more cunning and cruel than the old Yuan Shikai, today's people's patriotic self-defense war is much stronger than the Yunnan anti-Yuan uprising, and the people's level of awareness is much higher. The path of history is absolutely impossible to change!

　　云南起义三十一周年
    本报资料室
    三十一年前的今天，云南护国军高举义旗，宣布大独裁者袁世凯和他的“洪宪”帝国应该毁灭。
    当时的情势是这样的：
    一方面，代表反动的大地主大资产阶级利益的袁世凯，在盗窃了辛亥革命果实以后，用种种方法摧残自由资产阶级的民主运动。民国二年三月二十日刺杀主张“政党内阁监督总统”的宋教仁，五月二十三日炸死徐宝山，四月二十六日与英、法、德、俄、日五国银行团签订准备内战的“善后大借款合同”，七月至九月先后压平孙中山组织的赣、闽、粤、湘、川及南京、徐州的国民党“二次革命”，十月十日贿选就任正式大总统，十一月四日下令解散国民党，取消国会中的国民党议员。民国三年一月四日解散国会，二十八日解散各省议会，五月一日颁布御用的“中央政治会议”的“新约法”，民国四年五月九日和日本签订卖国的二十一条。不久，他的爪牙杨度等人发起“筹安会”，筹备帝制，并制造了一些用钱收买的“民意”与乞丐娼妓的“请愿”。终于在十二月十二日，最后撕下“民主”外衣，赤裸裸地登上专制帝座。
    另一方面，软弱的民族资产阶级在明白了与袁妥协是上当了以后，开始注意到出卖全国人民之后自己也必然陷于孤立与毁灭，转而积极组织倒袁反帝运动。孙中山的“二次革命”虽然被压平下去了，可是接踵而来的就是民国四年十二月廿五日开始的普遍讨袁起义。以蔡松坡、唐继尧为首的云南的护国军首先发难，三路出师向川边、湘边、桂边等处出动。紧接着有民国五年一月廿七日的贵州独立，二月十五日广西陆荣廷、梁启超、陈炳坤等部的进攻湘粤袁军，四月五日广东“龙家军”在四面楚歌下起而反袁，浙江、四川、陕西、湖南、江苏、山东等省纷纷响应，就连帝国主义各国的使节和袁世凯自己的得意门生陈宦，在这时也不得不要求袁世凯退位。
    袁世凯在这样极端孤立的情况下，不仅被迫取消了帝制，而且“百日皇帝”的“活罪”把他送进了坟墓。
    袁世凯灭亡了，但是，卅一年后的今天，“袁世凯”类型的独裁人物又走上了他的旧路。虽然今天的袁世凯比老袁凯更狡滑、更残酷，但今天的人民爱国自卫战争，比云南讨袁起义力量却强大得多，人民觉悟程度也高得多，历史的道路是决然无法改变的！
