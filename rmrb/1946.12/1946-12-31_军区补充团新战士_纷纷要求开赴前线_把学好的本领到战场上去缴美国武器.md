　　New Soldiers of the Military Region's Replenishment Regiment
    Eagerly Request to Go to the Front Lines
    To Use Their Skills to Seize American Weapons on the Battlefield
    [Our Special Dispatch] After hearing the glorious victory of annihilating four brigades of Chiang's army on the Su-Wan-North Line, the new soldiers of the Military Region's Replenishment Regiment eagerly requested to go to the front lines to kill the enemy. They said, "We ask to go to the front, to defeat Old Chiang as soon as possible. Seeing that the counter-offensive has arrived, we won't be able to eliminate Old Chiang if we don't go now!" New soldier Zhang Liye said, "Let's go quickly! After hearing the news in the newspaper, I can't sleep at night. Even if I don't eat meat for the New Year, I still want to go to the front line!" Comrade Zhang Chunyuan said, "I've been out for more than two months, eating a lot of public millet, and I've learned several skills. I can throw a grenade more than 30 meters. If I'm not allowed to take a grenade to the front line to exchange for a few American weapons to carry on my back, when the folks at home ask me what I did in the army, I'll have nothing to say." Many soldiers wrote letters to the regimental leaders, asking them to tell the military region leaders, requesting approval of their requests. The guards even mentioned in their letters: "Please ask the regimental leaders to pass on our opinions to other companies. If they agree, let's go together." The letter from the Sixth Company of the Second Battalion said: "Please take us to the military region to pay New Year's greetings to leaders like Liu and Deng. We are prepared to ask for good guns when Commander Liu speaks, and we want to go to the front lines. If he doesn't let us go, we won't let him step down from the stage." Li Lixin said, "We want to go to pay New Year's greetings to the military region leaders and see what Commander Liu looks like." Gao Nianxi said, "Let's practice hard before the New Year and go to pay New Year's greetings to Commander Liu during the New Year to let him see if our skills are good enough." They also felt that it was not glorious to always be new recruits in the replenishment regiment. They wanted to join the regular army and learn from the old brothers. The soldiers of the Sixth Company said: "We want to go to the regular army to kill the enemy. We don't want to waste our days here. We want to wear American coats, carry American-made weapons, and seize the spoils of victory." The soldiers also spontaneously and freely formed "joint conventions," guaranteeing that they were not afraid of death, did not miss their families, and would not desert. They solemnly signed their names and put their fingerprints on the conventions, asking the superiors to believe them. It is reported that the person in charge of the regiment has replied to the soldiers' request and will personally lead all the officers and soldiers of the regiment to the military region to pay New Year's greetings to the leaders, demonstrate their skills, and propose to go to the front lines to join the regular army, requesting the leaders' approval.
