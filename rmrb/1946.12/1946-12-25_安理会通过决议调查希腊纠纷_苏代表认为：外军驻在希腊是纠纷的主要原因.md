Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Chenggong Lake news: After several days of debate, the Security Council has passed the US proposal to send a fact-finding committee to Greece to verify the causes of the dispute. The US proposal is for the Security Council to send a committee composed of the five major powers, plus Poland and Brazil, to investigate the "relevant areas" where the dispute occurred. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, agreed to conduct an investigation, but doubted whether this method could achieve good results. Gromyko believed that the presence of foreign troops in Greece was one of the main causes of the dispute, and that border disputes often occurred in the Balkans, but often due to violations by British aircraft and Greek troops. Gromyko proposed two amendments to the US proposal, one of which was to limit the investigation area to the "border areas" of Greece, Albania, and Bulgaria. US and British representatives disagreed with this amendment, and the Soviet representative did not insist. The Security Council then passed the US proposal by a vote of nine to zero, with Britain and Egypt abstaining.

　　安理会通过决议
    调查希腊纠纷
    苏代表认为：外军驻在希腊是纠纷的主要原因
    【新华社延安二十一日电】成功湖消息：安理会在数日辩论之后，已通过美国所提建议，派遣事实调查委员会赴希腊，证实发生纠纷的原因。美国的建议是由安理会派遣一个由五强加上波兰与巴西所组成的委员会，赴发生纠纷的“有关区域”进行调查。苏代表葛罗米柯同意进行调查，但怀疑此种方法是否能达到良好结果。葛氏认为外国军队驻在希腊是纠纷的主要原因之一，巴尔干边界的确常常发生纠纷，但经常是由于英国飞机与希腊军队的侵犯所引起。葛氏对美方的建议曾提出两点修正，其一为限制调查地区为希保南等“边界区域”。美英等代表不同意此种修正，苏代表未加坚持，安理会乃以九票对零票通过美方建议，英国与埃及弃权。
