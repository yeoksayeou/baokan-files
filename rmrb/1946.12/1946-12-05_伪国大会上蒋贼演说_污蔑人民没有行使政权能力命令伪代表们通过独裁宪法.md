　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. News from Nanjing: On the 28th of last month, Chiang Kai-shek staged the farce of "returning power to the people," submitting the "Revised Draft of the May 5th Constitution" to the "National Assembly," which he single-handedly orchestrated and was full of ugly performances. He then delivered a speech claiming, "Today, the National Government submits the draft constitution to the National Assembly, and from now on, the responsibility for major national affairs is handed over to the people of the whole country!" (!) Chiang Kai-shek declared that the so-called "Revised Draft of the Constitution" submitted to the "National Assembly" was "agreed to by most parties participating in the Political Consultative Conference, although the Chinese Communist Party did not participate." The so-called "most parties" refer to the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, who are selling out the country and seeking refuge. Chiang Kai-shek explained that this revised draft constitution is in line with Sun Yat-sen's "Five-Power Constitution because the people do not have the ability or habit to exercise political power," "and also fear that those who will control the 'power to govern' in the future" cannot be like himself, "taking the heart of the Father of the Nation as their own." He said: "The Five-Power Constitution is best exercised by the Father of the Nation himself," "I believe that if I myself were to exercise the Five-Power Constitution, I would certainly be able to take the heart of the Father of the Nation as my own!" (!) Use the power to govern to protect political power and cultivate political power so that civil rights can be fully developed!" (!) Chiang Kai-shek ordered the representatives of the "National Assembly" to pass this draft constitution agreed upon by the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, and predicted that the "Five-Power Constitution will definitely be fully realized in the future"; that is, to simply restore the "May 5th" Constitution. According to a Nanjing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 1st, the so-called "future" is "at the time of the second 'National Assembly' six months later."

　　伪国大会上蒋贼演说
  　污蔑人民没有行使政权能力命令伪代表们通过独裁宪法
    【新华社延安二日电】南京讯：上月二十八日蒋介石扮演“还政于民”的丑剧，以“五五宪草修正案”提出于其一手包办、丑态百出的“国民大会”，随即发表演说称：“今天国民政府将宪法草案提交国民大会，以后国家大事的责任，交给全国人民了”（！）蒋介石声言提交“国大”的所谓“宪草修正案”“中国共产党虽没有参加，而参加政协的大多数党派是经过同意的”。所谓“大多数党派”即卖国投靠的青年党及民社党。蒋介石解释该宪草修正案与孙中山的“五权宪法和符合，因为人民没有行使政权的能力和习惯”，“而且恐怕将来掌握‘治权’的人”，不能像他自己一样“以国父之心为心”。他说：“五权宪法最好是由国父本人来行使”，“我相信我假如我自己来行使五权宪法，我一定能以国父之心为心”（！）以治权来保护政权，培育政权使民权充分发扬”（！）蒋介石命令“国民大会”代表们通过这一经青年党、民社党所同意的宪草，并预测将来“五权宪法一定能完全实现”；即是说干脆恢复“五五”宪草，所谓“将来”据合众社一日南京电称：即是“六个月以后的第二次‘国大’之时”。
