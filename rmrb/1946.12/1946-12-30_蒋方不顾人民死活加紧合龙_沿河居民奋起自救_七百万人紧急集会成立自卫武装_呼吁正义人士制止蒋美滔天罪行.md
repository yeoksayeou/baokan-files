　　Jiang's Side, Disregarding the People's Lives, Intensifies the Closure
	Residents Along the River Rise Up in Self-Defense
	Seven Million People Hold Emergency Meetings to Establish Self-Defense Armed Forces
	Calling on Just Individuals to Stop Jiang and the U.S.'s Heinous Crimes
	[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Kuomintang is undermining previous river management agreements, disregarding the lives of seven million residents along the lower reaches of the Yellow River. They are now accelerating the blocking of the gap and dumping stones at Huayuankou, excavating diversion canals, and ordering the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to complete the work and release water before January 5th of next year. Upon hearing this news, seven million residents in seventeen counties along the Ji-Lu-Yu area filled with righteous indignation, and spontaneously held meetings to discuss flood prevention and self-rescue. In the old river channel areas of Puyang, Dongming, Juancheng and other places, 360,000 residents in 1,026 new and old villages have largely been unable to move because the Kuomintang government has repeatedly delayed the allocation of the 1.5 million yuan of relocation relief funds stipulated in the Shanghai agreement; the few remaining escape boats have been completely burned by the Jiang army in the war. Once the Yellow River comes, not only will all river villages and property be gone, but even escaping with their lives will be impossible. Therefore, the masses in areas such as Dengzhuang in Juancheng are indignantly cursing Old Jiang for being black-hearted.
　　The masses in various counties along the river unanimously believe that the original dangerous sections and dams on both sides of the embankment have been destroyed and are useless. The Kuomintang government not only failed to allocate funds and materials on schedule according to the agreement, deliberately hindering our area's repair of dangerous sections, but also launched a large-scale military offensive against our area. After occupying Heze, Juancheng and other counties, they looted all the river management materials prepared by our area with the greatest effort. In the first repair and defense section of Ji-Lu-Yu alone, more than 2 million catties of flour, 490,000 catties of hemp rope, 192,000 hemp bags, 70,000 wooden stakes, and more than 2 million catties of straw were looted.
　　An old villager from Niuqiao in Puyang said: "If the dangerous sections are not repaired, what good is the embankment? When the Yellow River comes, won't it just collapse!" What makes them most resentful is that after the Jiang army occupied Juancheng and other places, they dug a large number of trenches and fortifications on the embankment that our area's masses had worked hard to repair day and night this summer, severely damaging the embankments on both sides. The section from the old city of Juancheng to the Puyang dam has been largely destroyed. The masses in the old city grit their teeth when they mention this.
　　The masses in Kaocheng and Dongming emphasized that the embankments on both sides in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of the upper Yellow River have never been seriously repaired and remain dilapidated; and the 25-mile section from Huangji (west of Kaocheng) in our area to Yantan in the Jiang area has not been repaired because the Kaocheng Jiang army repeatedly attacked our river repair workers this summer (more than 20 people have been arrested). In this way, the Yellow River will breach upstream, and the downstream residents will inevitably suffer. They said angrily: "Even if we repair our section, if the Kuomintang-controlled areas upstream don't repair, aren't we just wasting our efforts? If they breach, the water will still flood us."
　　At mass meetings in various counties along the river, they also criticized the crimes of American imperialism in helping Chiang Kai-shek actively close the gap. The masses in Yangji, Puyang pointed out: "The Executive Headquarters has repeatedly delayed providing river management materials to the liberated areas. This is a conspiracy between American imperialist elements and Chiang Kai-shek to flood our people along the river."
　　The masses in various places advocated issuing urgent appeals to the United Nations and righteous people across the country, requesting everyone to uphold justice and effectively stop this heinous crime of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek; and demanding that the closure and release of water not occur before the embankments and dangerous sections are repaired and the residents of the river channels are relocated. They also firmly stated that if the Kuomintang remains unrepentant, fails to implement previous river management agreements, and continues to accelerate the closure of the gap, then the masses along the river will have no choice but to rise up in armed self-defense in order to protect their homes, parents, wives, property, and ancestral graves.
　　Now, this armed self-rescue movement has been greatly developed in the seventeen counties along the Ji-Lu-Yu area. Dongming and Changyuan counties have established "River People's Self-Rescue Teams" of four to five hundred people. Juancheng and Puyang have organized nearly a thousand "Anti-Yellow River Self-Defense Armies," and in Puyang, there is a "Anti-Yellow River Brigade" of six hundred people. In Shouyang, Kaocheng, Changqing, Pingyin, Kaocheng and other counties, "River Defense Battalions" and "Yellow River Guerrilla Teams" of more than one hundred to several hundred people have also been established one after another. They are determined to spare no sacrifice and vow to fight to the end to stop this tyranny of the Jiang bandits. (Xi Min)

　　蒋方不顾人民死活加紧合龙
    沿河居民奋起自救
    七百万人紧急集会成立自卫武装
    呼吁正义人士制止蒋美滔天罪行
    【本报特讯】国民党破坏历次治河协议，不顾黄河下游沿岸七百万居民的死活，现正在花园口加紧堵口抛石，挖掘引河，并限令黄河水利委员会于明年一月五日以前完工，合龙放水。消息传来，冀鲁豫沿河十七县七百万居民莫不义愤填胸，纷纷自动集会，讨论防水自救。濮县、东明、鄄城等地旧河道内一千零二十六个新旧村庄的三十六万居民，由于国民党政府一再拖延拨发在上海协议中所规定的一百五十万万元迁移救济费，绝大部分至今尚未搬动；他们残存的少数逃难船只，在战争中，又被蒋军全部烧毁，黄水一来，不仅所有河道村庄、财产荡然无存，即欲逃得一条活命，也不可得。因此，鄄城邓庄一带的群众都激愤的痛骂老蒋黑了心。
    沿河各县的群众一致认为两岸大堤原有的险工、坝头，均已破毁无用。国民党政府不仅未遵照协议，按期拨付工款、工料，有意阻挠我区修补险工；反而对我区发动了大规模军事进攻，于其侵占荷泽、鄄城等县后，将我区竭尽最大努力所准备好的一切治河物资，抢劫一空。仅冀鲁豫第一修防段，即被抢去面粉二百余万斤，麻绳四十九万斤，麻袋十九万二千条，木椿七万根，秸料二百余万斤。
    濮县牛桥的老乡说：“险工修不好，大堤能管个球用，黄水过来，还不是一冲就垮！”最使他们痛恨的是，蒋军侵占鄄城等地后，竟在今夏我区群众不分昼夜艰苦赶修好的大堤上，大量挖掘战壕、工事，将两岸大堤大加破毁，现由鄄城旧城集至濮阳坝头一段已大半被破毁。旧城集的群众提起这件事来，莫不咬牙切齿。
    考城、东明的群众着重指出，黄河上游国民党地区内，两岸大堤从未认真进行修筑，仍然残破如故；而由我区黄集（考城西）到蒋区阎潭一段之二十五里，今夏因考城蒋军之一再袭击我修河工人，（先后捕走二十余名），亦始终未能修筑。如此，黄水过来在上游就会决口，下游居民亦难免于祸。他们愤怒地说：“咱们这里修好了，上游国民党地区不修，还不是自搭？他们那里决了口，水下来照样还是淹咱。”
    在沿河各县的群众集会上，并纷纷指摘美帝国主义帮助蒋介石积极堵口的罪行。濮县杨集的群众指出：“行总屡次拖延不给解放区治河物资，是美帝国主义分子和蒋介石合谋来淹我沿河民众。”
    各地群众都主张向联合国及全国正义人士发出紧急呼吁，要求大家来主持正义，有效的制止美帝国主义和蒋介石的这种滔天罪行；并要求在大堤、险工尚未修复，河道居民还未迁移前，不要合龙放水。他们更坚决表示，如国民党仍执迷不悟，不执行历次治河协议，继续加紧堵口，则沿河群众为了保卫自己的家乡父母妻子财产和祖宗的坟墓，只有奋起武装自卫。
    现在，这种武装自救运动，已在冀鲁豫沿河十七县大大开展起来。东明和长垣两县均已成立了四五百人的“河民自救队”，鄄城及濮县则分别组织起来将近千人的“抗黄自救军”，在濮阳则有六百人的“抗黄大队”，在寿张、考城、长清、平阴考城等县，也相继建立起由百余人至数百人的“河防营”及“黄河游击队”；他们决心不惜一切牺牲，誓为制止蒋贼的这种暴行而奋斗到底。（西民）
