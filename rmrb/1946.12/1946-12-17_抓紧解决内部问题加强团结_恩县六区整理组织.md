　　Grasp Tightly Solving Internal Problems and Strengthening Unity
　　Organization of the Sixth District of En County Consolidated
　　[Weixian Report, Thirteenth of this Month] After a great mass movement in the Sixth District of En County, "land to the tiller" was realized. Cadres overcame the idea that "after the fruits are divided, the great task is accomplished" and the phenomena of laxity and disorganization. They then went deep into the villages to carry out organizational consolidation and education work, initially realizing democratic life, launching frank self-criticism and criticism, and solving problems between activists and the masses, as well as within the masses. Gao Fengkui of Gao Village and Zhang Dianrong of Xiaoshizhuang quickly corrected their shortcomings after being criticized by the masses. Mutual criticism was first carried out at meetings of activists, and then led by cadres. Each group also gave timely encouragement to those being criticized to avoid discouragement. In expanding the organization, all villages combined mass mobilization with individual absorption, achieving full family participation in the organization. For example, after a mobilization meeting in Muwangzhuang, masses who were not in the farmers' association actively joined the organization. After struggles in individual villages, some backward members and those who were struggled against secretly communicated with each other, intending to please both sides and fantasizing about preserving themselves after a "change of dynasty." The masses adopted a policy of education and transformation towards these people, rather than attacking and expelling them. The ＠ Village, in group meetings, combined current affairs education with criticism of these people, making them realize their errors, be frank, and then universally and voluntarily take oaths, achieving unprecedented consolidation and unity within the organization.

　　抓紧解决内部问题加强团结
    恩县六区整理组织
    【本报威县十三日电】恩县六区经过群众大动，实现“耕者有其田”，干部克服了“果实分完，大功告成”思想，与松懈散漫现象后，随即深入各村，进行整理组织及教育工作，初步实现了民主生活，展开了坦白反省与批评，解决了积极分子与群众及群众内部的问题。高庄高凤魁，小石庄张殿荣，经过群众批评后，都很快纠正了缺点。先在积极分子会上进行互相批评，然后再由干部领导他们进行。各组并及时给被批评人以鼓励，以免灰心丧气。扩大组织中，各村皆以大会动员与个别吸收相结合的方式，作到了全家参加组织，如穆王庄动员大会后，不在农会的群众纷纷参加组织，个别村庄斗争过后，有些落后会员与被斗户，暗暗通气，打算两边讨好，幻想“变天”后保存自己。群众对这些人采取了教育改造的方针，不是打击和开除。＠庄在小组会上对这些人结合时事教育，进行了批评，使其觉悟、坦白，然后普遍自动进行宣誓，使组织内部达到空前的巩固团结。
