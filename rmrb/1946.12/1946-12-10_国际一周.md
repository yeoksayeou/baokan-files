　　International Week
    In the past week, what has been encouraging is the significant progress made in the two major conferences in New York. After breaking the deadlock on the issue of the opening of the port free zone at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, many agreements were also reached on the Danube and reparations issues. Currently, only some minor details remain to be negotiated, and the final draft of the peace treaty with the five countries is expected to be completed this week. In the United Nations General Assembly, the most important committee – the Political and Security Committee – has passed the decision on countries providing information on domestic and foreign troops, and the discussions on disarmament and the Franco issue have also come to an end. After a long period of debate, international public opinion, which has been watching these two major conferences, breathed a sigh of relief at this good news. American newspapers believe that in the Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet representative's "art of negotiation occupied a winning position, while the American representative lost." Especially in the Political and Security Committee, the Soviet representative, in order to seek unanimous agreement, did not hesitate to make some concessions, which was praised by all representatives and further enhanced the Soviet Union's reputation and prestige in international political life.
    Outside of these two major conferences, the relationship between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States is noteworthy. British-Soviet trade negotiations are underway in London, and British diplomatic circles have stated that the British side will strive to sign a trade agreement with the Soviet Union, one of the purposes of which is to purchase goods from the Soviet Union that were previously imported from North America. British-American relations, on the other hand, have suddenly become tense in the Middle East. Following the tense situation in Palestine, Saudi Arabia, where American capital monopolizes all its oil fields, suddenly invaded Transjordan, which was supported by Britain, and it is reported that war has already broken out. The United States has also expressed "an unusual concern" about the British-Indian negotiations taking place in London, making the tense situation at the London conference "even more tense." (Agence France-Presse dispatch) Members of the British Parliament have asked the government to send personnel to investigate the situation of American anti-British sentiment in China. The American policy of expansion has clearly caused greater unease on the British side.
    The 400,000-strong coal miners' strike in the United States continues, and the Truman government's high-handed measures of fining miners' leader Lewis and the union have aroused more fierce resistance from the miners. Murray, the chairman of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, has advocated that workers and trade unions across the country unite to formulate a joint struggle program to repel the attacks of the reactionaries. At the same time, according to American economic experts, the first post-war economic crisis in the United States will break out next spring.
    In addition, wars between France and Vietnam, the Netherlands and Indonesia, and the Tehran government and Azerbaijan have also broken out in the past week. The reason is that the imperialists of France and the Netherlands and the reactionaries of Iran have broken their promises. But the Vietnamese people have declared that they will resist to the end, the Republic of Indonesia is fighting bravely, and Azerbaijan has issued a general mobilization order, implementing armed self-defense by all the people. The power of the people cannot be suppressed.

　　国际一周
    过去一周中，振奋人心的是纽约两大会议有了重要进展。四强外长会议于打开的港自由区问题的僵局后，又连接对多瑙河及赔款问题获得了许多协议，目前尚待磋商者仅余一些次要的细节了，预期对五国和约的最后方案将于本周内完成。联合国大会中最重要的一个委员会——政治安全委员会已通过了各国提供国内外军队情报的决定，而裁军问题及佛朗哥问题的讨论亦告一段落。各国舆论于凝视这两大会议在长时间的争论之后，为这些好消息松了一口气。美国报纸认为在外长会议上，由于苏联代表的“谈判艺术占着赢得的立场，而美国代表则输了”。特别在政治安全委员会上，苏联代表为了求得全体一致的协议，不惜作若干让步，得到所有代表赞扬，更加提高了苏联在国际政治生活中的声誉与威信。
    在这两大会议之外，苏英美三强的关系颇堪注意，英苏商务谈判正在伦敦进行中，英国外交界人士表示英方将努力与苏联签订商约，目的之一是从苏联买进过去一向自北美输入的货物。英美关系则在中东突趋紧张，继巴勒斯坦形势的剑拔弩张之后，为美国资本垄断其全部油田的沙特阿拉伯突然将其军队侵入为英国一手扶持的外约旦，据传业已发生战事。美国对正在伦敦举行的英印谈判又表示一异常关切”，使伦敦会议的紧张状态“更趋紧张”。（法新闻处电）英下院议员则要求政府派员考察美在华排英的情况。美国的扩张政策显已引起英方更大的不安。
    美国国内四十万煤矿大罢工仍继续中，杜鲁门政府判处矿工领袖路易斯及工会以罚金的高压手段，招致矿工们更激烈的反抗。产业工会联合会主席莫莱已倡议全国工人及职工会团结起来，制订联合斗争纲领，打退反动派的进攻。同时据美国经济专家预计，美国战后第一次经济危机将于明春爆发。
    此外法越之间、荷兰与印尼之间、德黑兰政府与阿塞拜疆之间的战事又于过去一周内相继爆发，原因是法国及荷兰的帝国主义分子，伊朗的反动派背信弃义食言而肥。但越南人民已宣布抵抗到底，印尼共和国正奋勇迎击，阿塞拜疆已颁布总动员令，实行全民武装自卫，人民的力量是压不倒的。
