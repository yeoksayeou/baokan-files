[This report from Weixian, 26th] In solving the land problem in poor villages in Southern Hebei, Qinghe, Shen County has created valuable experience in joint struggle. Qinghe once proposed launching a joint struggle during the investigation and reduction of rent, and unifying the distribution of fruits, but in actual practice, the distribution of fruits mostly adopted the method of rich villages taking the lead and mobilizing rich villages to donate land. Experience has proven that this method is the best, easily connecting the thinking of the rich village masses and achieving conscious voluntariness. Liu Baozhuang, Ge Xianzhuang, Zhang Tun, and Li Liuzhuang donated more than 200 mu of land to help eliminate the extreme poverty of eleven villages including Xiaomatun and Jinye, consolidating the unity of poor and rich villages. Conversely, if the leadership forcibly unifies the distribution of fruits, the thinking of the rich village masses cannot be connected, and the poor village masses compete for it, which will create opposition and dissatisfaction between rich and poor villages. In the experience of joint struggle in Shen County, poor village cadres can, according to the poor situation in their village, request help from rich villages in a consultative manner and with an attitude of listening to their convenience. When rich villages see that poor villages are not competing, coupled with cadre education, the rich villages will be able to increase their land donations to poor villages. In the joint struggle in Zhao Zhuang, a few landlords were first struggled against, and the land problem of the farmers in the village was solved as a priority; later, the funds from the struggle belonged to the village, and the land was completely distributed to small villages with the voluntary consent of the masses. The common experience of the two counties is that joint struggles can be launched according to the villages dominated and exploited by local bullies and landlords or under the assistance of the main village. When distributing the fruits, the leadership must conduct in-depth education on the rich village masses on "all the poor people in the world are one family," and the small villages must request the large villages to voluntarily donate land in a consultative manner, which is the best method.

　　清河莘县解决穷村土地问题
    创动员富村赠地办法
    穷村富村思想打通真正做到自愿自觉
    【本报威县二十六日电】冀南在解决贫村土地问题中，清河莘县创造出联合斗争的宝贵经验。清河查减中曾提出发动联合斗争，统一分配果实，但在实际行动中，分配果实时多是采取了以富村为主及动员富村赠地的办法。经验证明，这个办法最好，容易打通富村群众思想，作到自觉自愿，刘保庄、葛仙庄、张屯、李六庄向外赠地二百余亩，帮助消灭了小马屯、靳耶等十一村的赤贫，巩固了穷富村的团结。相反的，如领导上强令统一分配果实，富村群众思想打不通，穷村群众争着要，便会造成富村与穷村的对立与不满。莘县联合斗争的经验，穷村村干部可根据本村穷苦情况，以商量方式与多少听便的态度，请求富村帮助，富村见穷村不争，再加上干部教育，富村对穷村的赠地便能加多。赵庄联合斗争中，先斗了几户地主，尽先解决本村农民土地问题；以后斗争的资财归了本村，土地则在群众自愿下完全分给小村。两县共同经验，根据恶霸地主统治剥削所及的村庄或在主村求援之下，可以发动联合斗争，分果实时，领导上要对富村群众深入“天下穷人是一家”的教育，小村要以协商态度，请求大村自动赠地，是一个最好的办法。
