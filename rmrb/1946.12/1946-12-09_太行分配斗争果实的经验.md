The Experience of Distributing the Fruits of Struggle in Taihang
    Li Xintian, Yu Yi

In this period of the mass emancipation movement, various localities, based on the experience and lessons learned over the past year, have broken away from the weakness of emphasizing mass mobilization while neglecting the distribution of the fruits of struggle. They have recognized that distributing the fruits is a crucial link in consolidating mass mobilization, as well as the central issue in uniting cadres, uniting cadres with the masses, and uniting middle peasants. They have adopted the correct mass line and achieved considerable success, also gaining rich experience.

First, they have grasped the principle of realizing "land to the tiller" and mobilizing and uniting the broad masses (everyone struggles, everyone gets the fruits, enabling peasants to obtain land). Neiqiu adopted the method of distributing what was lacking; poor peasants received more land. If there was good land, they got bad land; if there was bad land, they got good land. Those without land got more; those with land got nothing. Those lacking other things got some money. Wu'an put forward the "resolutely implement the leveling policy," first filling the gaps in housing, land, money, and grain, and then distributing clothes and furniture widely. Boai's Fourth District basically adopted the principle of centralized distribution for land and houses, targeting extremely poor households, poor peasants, demobilized veterans, and families of martyrs with little land. The distribution of clothing and other items was also broad, with middle peasants who participated in the struggle also receiving a share.

Second, the distribution method followed the mass line, democratic discussion, and combined ideological education.

1.  A Struggle Fruit Evaluation Committee elected by the masses (with more people) was responsible for the following tasks: (1) Investigating and registering the population, land, livestock, houses, clothes, furniture, etc., excluding the property of the peasants themselves, and registering what was needed as a reference for evaluation. (2) Based on the investigation materials and adopting mass opinions, classifying classes and grades, drafting distribution opinions, posting them for the masses to deliberate and discuss. (3) Revising and correcting the distribution again based on mass opinions. (4) Issuing a detailed list to complete the clearing procedures after the distribution is completed.

2.  Mobilizing the masses for democratic discussion, Heshun Dongguan, when distributing the fruits, raised the questions: Should the fruits be distributed to those with problems, or according to the population? Or according to the depth of poverty? After mass deliberation and discussion, the conclusion was: First fill the potholes. They also proposed discussing who should get more and who should get less? The conclusion was: middle and poor peasants with "anti-" [referring to families of soldiers fighting against the Japanese] should get more than ordinary households of their class... After the evaluation committee drafted a plan, the masses discussed and revised it before the distribution.

3.  Combining ideological education, mainly to solve the selfishness of cadres, the unity of the masses, and to improve the masses' class consciousness: (1) Educating cadres to overcome selfishness and special treatment, uniting with the masses, and serving the masses, breaking the "merit" thinking. Cixian put forward "A thousand days of moral cultivation can be ruined in an instant"; the chairman of the Nanqie Village peasant association in Pingding thought after the discussion: "I understand now. I should get a lot of fruit, but I am selfish, only want to get more, and think that the emancipation movement is my credit, so I should get more. This is really wrong." This was his realization that emancipation relied on everyone's united struggle. (2) Carrying out the education of everyone uniting to struggle, everyone uniting to emancipate themselves, "peasants all over the world are one family." Wu'an put forward the slogans "Be merciless to the enemy, but help each other internally"; "The poorer you are, the more exploited you are, those who got less in the past should get more now, and those who got more should get less"; "Everyone is emancipated, so time can be consolidated," and successfully distributed the fruits. (3) Discussing who the fruits belong to (improving class consciousness), how they were obtained (clarifying united struggle), how to use them (implementing production and becoming prosperous), and how to defend them (enlightening armed consciousness), and carrying out general grievance sessions during the distribution of the fruits to implement ideological mobilization. Wuzhi's Fourth District put forward the policy of "Fight to the end, accuse to the end," "The process of distributing the fruits is also the process of deeply mobilizing the masses." General grievance sessions were held during the distribution of the fruits, which further improved the masses' class consciousness.

In addition, the following issues should also be noted: (1) Distributing as you fight is able to encourage the masses' courage and enthusiasm for struggle, and can also avoid corruption and waste by cadres. However, the overall situation must be controlled, and the front and back must be taken care of to achieve overall rationality and fairness. (2) Immediately retrieve the red contracts and tax the dead contracts to ensure that the peasants obtain ownership. (3) Some of the public temples and social properties can be distributed, allowing peasants to tax the dead contracts, leaving a portion as public property and solving the land problem for resettling demobilized veterans.

Third, cadres promote the revolutionary quality of serving the masses, and the masses promote revolutionary friendship, consciously withdrawing the fruits they have received too much and donating the fruits to poor peasants in neighboring villages. On the cadre side, the Xiangyuan County Party Committee made a decision in August: county and district cadres should return the fruits they bought cheaply from the masses in the first half of the year, and should not buy them during the movement from then on. The cadres consciously returned the fruits to the masses. Comrade Hao Erpu, secretary of the Fifth District Branch of Wuxiang, under the call of the County Party Committee, returned the fruits (quilts, clothes, etc.) he bought cheaply from the masses of Songshuzhuang, and made self-criticism, which influenced the district chief and district cadres to return them to the masses as well. The village cadres also returned the fruits they had received too much, eliminating the masses' estrangement from the cadres, and once again launched a fierce movement in Songshuzhuang. Cadres in the Fourth District of Yushe launched the Hao Sanle movement, wanting to wholeheartedly serve the masses, and not wanting a single thing from the masses. The county chief and county committee of Heshun took the lead in setting an example, self-criticizing and saying: "If the top beam is not straight, the second beam will be crooked, and if the third beam is not straight, the house will collapse. We should be the first to withdraw."

The masses consciously donated land to neighboring villages and donated money to neighboring streets. There was a model in Wu'an: Nanda and Beida communities in the Third District proposed from the leadership: "We have turned ourselves over, and we must help neighboring villages turn themselves over." After mass deliberation and discussion, it was decided to donate 200 mu of good land to the poor brothers in Wuhua Township, where the land was barren. The second street in Wu'an City was very poor, and the third and sixth streets donated fruits and ocean to help turn themselves over. In some areas, the fruits were distributed by jointly struggling and taking care of poor villages. After the joint struggle of 14 villages including Shahe Huaizhuang and Jizhuang, the rich villages helped the poor villages. The masses of Jizhuang said: "Our village is not too poor, the fruits should be distributed more to the poor brothers in the poor villages." Therefore, six extremely poor villages such as Hebeizhuang were assigned 50 percent of all fruits, four poor villages such as Wangzhuang were assigned 30 percent, and three moderately poor villages such as Balizhuang were assigned 20 percent.

These valuable experiences are worth continuing to promote in this winter's mass movement, and organizing inspections of the distribution of fruits to deepen the mass movement. In particular, county, district, and village cadres who have bought fruits cheaply or received too much should implement the "Decision of the District Party Committee on How County and District Cadres Above Treat the Fruits of Struggle in the Mass Emancipation Movement" precisely. At present, some county leaders are encouraging their subordinates to return the fruits, but they have not yet withdrawn themselves. They should emulate the exemplary actions of the Heshun county chief and county secretary, so that the top beam must first be the example for the second beam to be straight. In this way, uniting cadres, uniting the masses, and deepening the movement can all have a real guarantee.

　　太行分配斗争果实的经验
    李心田、于一
    这一段的群众翻身运动中，各地在分配斗争果实上，由于一年来历次的经验教训，打破了重视发动群众而忽略分配斗争果实的弱点，认识到分果实是巩固发动群众的重要环节，以及团结干部、团结干部与群众、团结中农的中心问题、采取了正确的群众路线，获得了相当大的成绩，也取得了丰富的经验。
    首先是掌握了实现耕者有其田，发动团结广大群众的原则（大家斗争，大家得果实，使农民得到土地）。内邱是缺什分什的办法，贫苦农民多分土地，有好的则分坏的，有坏的则分好的，没地的多分，有地的不分，其他东西不缺的分些钱。武安提出了“坚决贯彻填平方针”，房地钱粮先填坑，衣服家具分配面要宽。博爱四区则是土地房子基本上采取集中分配原则，分配对象是赤贫、贫农、荣退军人、抗属少地的户。衣服等件面也宽，参加斗争的中农也有份。
    第二、分配方法上是群众路线，民主讨论，结合思想教育。
    一、由群众选举评分斗争果实委员会（人可多一些），担负如下任务：（一）调查登记人口、土地、牲口、房屋、衣服、家具等，除农民本人财产外，并登记所需要什么，以作评分的参考。（二）根据调查材料，采取群众意见，划分阶层、等级，评拟分配意见，榜示群众，酝酿讨论。（三）再根据群众意见，复评修正分配。（四）分配完成后出清单以清理手续。
    二、发动群众民主讨论，和顺东关在分果实时，提出：分果实是有问题的得，还是按人口分？还是按穷根的深浅分？由群众酝酿讨论，最后得出结论是：先填平圪洞。并提出讨论谁该多得、谁该少得？结论是：中贫农中带“抗”字的应该比他本阶层的一般户多得…………………经评分委员会评拟草案后，再由群众讨论修改，再行分配。
    三、结合思想教育，主要是解决干部的自私，群众的团结，以及提高群众阶级觉悟：（一）教育干部克服自私特殊，团结群众，为群众服务的思想，打破“功劳”思想，磁县提出了“千日修德一时伤”；平定南茄村农会主席在讨论后认为：“我想通了，按说我分果实可不少，咱自私心大，光想多得，又觉翻身运动是我的功劳，应该多得，这实在不对。”这是他认识到翻身依靠大家团结斗争的结果。（二）进行大家团结斗争，大家团结翻身，“天下农民是一家”的教育，武安提出了“对外你死我活，对内互助互让”；“越穷越受剥削多，过去分得少的现在应多分，分得多的应少分”；“大家都翻身，时光才能巩固”等口号，圆满分配了果实。（三）讨论果实是谁的（提高阶级觉悟），怎样得来（明确团结斗争），怎样去用（贯彻生产发家），怎样保卫（启发武装自觉），并在分果实时进行总诉苦，以贯彻思想发动。武陟四区提出了“斗到底，诉到底”，“分果实过程，也是深入发动群众的过程”方针，分果实中进行了总诉苦，使群众阶级觉悟进一步的提高。
    此外，还要注意下列几个问题：（一）随斗随分，是能鼓舞群众斗争勇气和热情，又能避免干部的贪污浪费。但须统掌全盘，照顾前后，做到整个合理公道。（二）即时要回红契，税成死契，保证农民得到所有权。（三）公庙社产等可以分配一部分，让农民税成死契，留下一部分作为公产并解决安置荣退军人的土地问题。
    第三，干部发扬为群众服务的革命品质，群众发扬革命友爱，自觉的退出多得果实和赠献穷苦邻村农民果实。在干部方面，襄垣县委于八月作出决定：县区干部退回前半年贱买群众的果实，此后运动中一律不买。干部自觉的退给了群众。武乡五区分委书记郝二朴同志在县委号召下，把贱买松树庄群众的果实（被子、衣服等）退给群众，并作了自我批评，影响了区长、区干部等也都退给群众，村干部也退去了多得果实，消除了群众对干部的隔阂，再度掀起了松树庄的猛烈运动。榆社四区干部掀起了郝三乐运动，要赤心为群众，不要群众的丝毫东西。和顺县长、县委首起模范，自我批评说：“大梁不正二梁歪，三梁不正垮了台，我们应首先退出来。”
    群众自觉赠田邻村，赠款邻街，这在武安是有了典范：三区南北大社由领导上提出：“咱们翻了身，还要帮助邻村翻身。”经群众酝酿讨论，决定以二百亩良田赠给了地瘠土薄的五和乡穷苦弟兄。武安城二街很穷，三、六街赠给了果实洋帮助翻身。有的地区是由联合斗争，照顾贫村分配果实。沙河淮庄、冀庄等十四村联合斗争后，富村帮助了穷村。冀庄群众说：“我们村里不太穷，果实应多分给贫苦村的穷弟兄。”因而河北庄等六个极贫苦村分得了全部果实的百分之五十，王庄等四个贫村分得了百分之三十，八里庄等三个中贫村分得百分之二十。
    这些宝贵经验，值得今冬群运中继续发扬，并组织检查分配果实，以深入群运。特别是县、区、村干部贱买与多得果实，应根据区党委“关于群众翻身运动中县区以上干部对待斗争果实的决定”，确切执行。目前有的县的领导同志鼓励下级退出果实，而自己仍未退出，应该效法和顺县长、县书的模范行动，以为正二梁必先正大梁的表率。如此则团结干部，团结群众，深入运动都能有了真实的保证。
