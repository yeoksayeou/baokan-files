    Completing Land Reform Promotes Prosperity
    Yuan Dynasty Launches Winter Production
    Breaking Ideological Barriers, Prosperous Middle Peasants Feel Secure Running Sidelines
    Yuecun Landlord Participates in Noodle Mill Mutual Aid Group and Labors Personally
    [This Dispatch from Weixian, 13th, Our Newspaper] After completing land reform, Yuan Dynasty is seizing the respite from war preparations to launch a large-scale winter production movement. Initially, there were some ideological obstacles among the masses that hindered the development of production. After the Jiang aircraft bombed Daming, some village cadres and activists in the Seventh District (adjacent to Daming) were unwilling to engage in production and indulged in eating and drinking. They said, "We'll enjoy every bite we get. When Chiang Kai-shek comes, we'll fight him. We won't regret dying." Some wealthy middle peasants were afraid of being struggled against and had poor enthusiasm for production. In order to break the ideological barriers to developing production, the district proposed: First, good cadres and good members should become prosperous and strive to become labor heroes. Second, deeply publicize the development of a rich peasant economy, explaining that property earned through labor will never be infringed upon, and employing labor is also allowed, in order to break down the reluctance to improve. Third, explain that war requires even greater efforts in production, combine war preparedness education, launch current affairs propaganda, and lay the foundation for the masses' confidence in victory, so that the masses can feel secure in production. After breaking through ideological barriers, all strata of society actively engaged in production. All thirty-two oil presses in the district, and more than twenty foreign-style bows and rolling mills, are working day and night. In Beixiaozhang Village, more than seventy-two of the ninety-plus households have joined the timber mill mutual aid group. In Kongtang Village, four oil presses and most of the villagers are participating in oil pressing. Dawangzhai has organized eight women's textile groups, and the masses in each village are discussing: "Today we have been given land and farm tools. Whether our lives are good or not in the future depends entirely on us." Ma Xiangyun, the landlord of Yuecun, Fifth District, who was struggled against, made his fortune by lending at usurious rates and had lived a parasitic life for most of his life. During this investigation and rent reduction, the masses thoroughly settled accounts with his feudal exploitation and educated him. He gradually realized the wrongness of illegal exploitation and parasitic life, and has now begun to labor personally. He and his neighbors organized a flour milling mutual aid group, and also takes time to collect firewood, push earth, and carry manure every day. He often says to the villagers: "For someone like me, it would be foolish to think of any other way besides focusing on production. In the future, what I make is made with my own blood and sweat, and no one can struggle against me again." The wealthy middle peasant Ma Zhongguo wanted to "voluntarily offer" his land during the rent reduction. At that time, the masses did not accept it, but did not explain it to him, so he ate and drank heavily every day and stopped producing, waiting to be struggled against. Later, after he understood the policy of uniting with middle peasants and developing the rich peasant economy, he was relieved of his worries. His son is now engaged in commerce, and he and his grandson grind flour and collect manure at home. The poor peasant Ma Zhili's family of nine had no land or house before, and no desire to produce. This year, during the rent reduction, he got eleven mu of land and a house. He grinds flour and collects firewood every day and does not want to be idle. Someone asked him, "How come you are also so diligent?" He said, "Before, we were hungry because we were exploited by the landlords. If we are hungry again in the future, it will be our own fault."

    完成土地改革推动发家致富
    元朝开展冬季生产
    打破思想障碍富中农安心经营副业
    岳村地主参加粉房互助组亲身劳动
    【本报威县十三日电】元朝于完成土地改革后，抓紧备战空隙，展开冬季大生产运动。开始，群众中有些思想障碍，妨害着生产的开展。七区（邻接大名）在蒋机轰炸大名后，部分村干部、积极分子便无心生产，大吃大喝，他们说：“吃了一口得一口，蒋介石来了和他拚，死了也不冤枉。”有些富裕中农怕斗，生产情绪不好。该区为打破开展生产的思想障碍，提出：一、好干部好会员要发家致富，翻身英雄争取作劳动英雄。二、深入宣传发展富农经济，说明绝不侵犯用劳力换来的财产，用雇工也是允许的，以打通不愿上升的思想。三、说明战争更应努力生产，结合备战教育，展开时事宣传，奠定群众胜利信心，使群众安心生产。各阶层打通思想后，都积极从事生产。全区三十二座油坊，二十多个洋弓、轧车，都是昼夜不停的工作。北小丈村九十多户已有七十二户参加木料厂互助组。孔堂村四座油坊、全村群众多数参加打油。大王寨已组织了八个妇女纺织组，各村群众都在议论：“今天分到了庄子地和农具，以后日子过好过不好全在咱了。五区岳村被斗地主马相云是靠放高利贷起的家，多半辈子过着寄生生活，这次查减中，群众彻底清算了他的封建剥削，并对他进行了教育，他逐渐认识了非法剥削、寄生生活的不对，现已开始亲手劳动。他和邻居组织了磨粉互助组，每天还抽空拾柴、推土、推粪。他常对乡亲说：“像我这样的人，除了安心生产，再想别的门都是糊涂，以后的东西是我用血汗制的，再也斗不着我了。”富裕中农马忠国在查减中要“自献”土地，当时群众不收，但未向他作解释，于是他每天大吃大喝，不再生产，等着斗。后来他了解了团结中农和发展富农经济的政策后，才把心病挖去。他儿现在经营商业，他和孙子在家磨粉、拾粪。贫农马志礼全家九口人，以前无地无房，也无心生产。今年查减中他得了十一亩地，房屋都有了，他每天磨粉、拾柴不肯闲。有人问他“你怎么也勤谨了？”他说：“以前挨饿是被地主剥削的，今后再挨饿就怨自己了。”
