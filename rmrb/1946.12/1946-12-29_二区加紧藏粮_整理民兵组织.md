　　【Another Dispatch】After the Second District held a meeting of village cadres on December 8th to discuss war preparations, the district and villages established command headquarters. All public and private grain in each village was buried to prevent the enemy from seizing a single grain. Livestock and carts were prepared to transport supplies and ammunition. The militia organization was reorganized, and elements such as former puppet soldiers and local ruffians were completely purged. After the self-defense forces were reorganized, they actively prepared stretchers to participate in the war. The masses of Liu Manzhai decided to bury the grain in four days, and on the seventh day, village cadres and militiamen will inspect the burial. Anyone who fails to bury grain will be criticized by the peasant representatives. Guard posts are strengthened, and special agents are strictly guarded against.
