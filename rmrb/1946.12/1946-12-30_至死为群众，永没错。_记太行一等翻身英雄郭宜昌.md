    ——Remembering Guo Yichang, a First-Class Liberated Hero of Taihang
    Zheng Jing
    “Cotton Fluff Hammer”
    I am from Shangzhuang Village, Lin County. I'm twenty-two years old. People say I'm plump, but I only gained this "liberation fat" after liberation.

    My village is like a "cotton fluff hammer," with tall brick houses on both sides and a line of mud houses and thatched sheds in the middle. I lived in the middle. The "hammerheads are ruthless, the two hammerheads squeeze the poor." In the north, there were the "Smiling Wolf" Li Xianglin and "One Tiger" Li Yuan; in the south, there was the "Staring-Eyed General" Li Dong. My father borrowed thirty yuan from them, creating a "bottomless pit." With "old shares and rolling interest," our fourteen hands paid back the interest, and it "cotton wrapped in fire" ballooned to two hundred yuan. My father and brothers panicked and fled to Shanxi, leaving me, my mother, and a younger sister. The Smiling Wolf also panicked, grabbing whatever he could. Two mu of our four mu of land were mortgaged. The remaining two mu were scraped away by the "Staring-Eyed General." They even tore down the beams and rafters of our house and dug out the stones from the foundation to build a cellar. My mother died of anger, my sister was sold, and my whole family was wiped out. I also went begging in Shanxi. Out of the two hundred households in the village, one hundred and eighty borrowed money from the Li family, and thirty followed in my footsteps. "Cotton fluff hammer, cotton fluff hammer, eats the meat in the middle, fattens both ends."

    Guo Wu Couldn't Stand Firm

    Lin County was liberated. The county removed the Smiling Wolf and appointed Guo Wu as the chairman of the peasants' association because he was poor. The next day, I joined the peasants' association. After Guo Wu became chairman, the Smiling Wolf gave him four mu of land. Every few days, he sent him coal, sweet potatoes, and white flour, always saying, "Being a cadre keeps you busy. If you're short of anything, just take it from my house. Work should be done by everyone." Village head Li Wuyuan also slowly started to benefit. After a month or so, things changed. Guo Wu and Li Wuyuan often went to the Smiling Wolf to get instructions. While other villages were already carrying out struggles, the Smiling Wolf couldn't sleep every night, thinking, "With Guo Wu and Wuyuan, the people in this village will be embarrassed to struggle against me, but if people from other villages come, I can't stop them. It's better to counter struggle with struggle." One day, he called Guo Wu and Wuyuan and said, "The neighboring villages have all held meetings. Our village can't be left out either. I'll give everyone whatever I have, but I don't want to let people from other villages drink this bowl of water. I always want to give it to the people of our village. Originally, there was no need to hold a meeting, but spreading this reputation can fend off people from other villages." Guo Wu said, "Right, right." The Smiling Wolf smiled: "But you two don't know, in recent years, I haven't been…" Before he could finish, Guo Wu understood: "Of course, we'll take care of it. Don't worry!" Guo Wu then convened the group leaders to mobilize: "Li Xianglin has been good to the people in our village. He doesn't want to give things to outsiders. Let the masses of our village hold a meeting to resolve it. Each of you notify your members to attend the meeting tomorrow." After trying several times to say what he didn't dare to say, he finally said: "However, since he's so enlightened, we should also be considerate." At the meeting the next day, the masses bowed their heads and didn't say a word. Guo Wu acted enthusiastically, gesticulating wildly. Finally, they calculated twenty dan of wheat and ten rifles. The masses felt it was quite a bit and prepared to leave. Guo Wu panicked, stomping his feet: "Don't leave, don't leave." Immediately after, he said: "Li Xianglin has shown great enlightenment. Do you agree to reduce eight rifles for him?" People looked at each other without answering. "If you agree, just say you agree!" Everyone answered in a mixed chorus, "Agreed." In the evening, the Smiling Wolf prepared egg noodle soup and steamed buns, inviting all the cadres above the group leader level. During the meal, the Smiling Wolf smiled as usual: "The meeting you all led was good, harmonious and agreeable, unlike the other villages that resort to violence and make people laugh! However, you all know about my situation in recent years:…" Everyone immediately understood the intention behind the dinner, looked at each other, and said nothing. In the end, the chairman spoke up: "Xianglin is also in difficulty. Regarding the two rifles we dealt with today, let's reduce one more. He can pay 13,200 yuan (the price is 25,000) for that rifle, what do you say?" Having eaten his food, everyone had soft mouths and could only say, "Agreed."

    At that time, I was just a member, unable to figure out the details, and didn't dare to speak rashly. Watching the chairman and the Smiling Wolf exchanging glances, the issue of the land was never raised. No one mentioned it, delaying work and preventing us from achieving liberation. A broken gong makes a good sound, and the outside villages spread the word that the liberation movement in Shangzhuang was going well, with ten rifles!

    The county held a cadre meeting, and I was specifically notified to attend. Guo Wu and his group brought steamed buns and dry rations, but we didn't even have bran cakes. At the meeting, Guo Wu reported on his work, saying: "The movement in our village has become vigorous, the local bullies have been overthrown, and the peasants have been liberated." Guo Wu was very attentive to me, afraid that I would speak, but I insisted on saying: "The cadres attending the meeting don't eat the bully's noodles, but the cadres in our village eat the bully's noodles. They struggled for three dan, resolved five dan; struggled for ten rifles, reduced eight, ate a meal, and reduced another one." Guo Wu's face turned red, and everyone looked at him, even his neck and ears turned red. Comrade Lao Liu from the county talked to me privately four times. I told him about the situation in the village, and he said: "Do you dare to do it?" I said: "As long as the higher authorities take the lead, I dare to do it." He then said: "Go back and do a good job, be bold, and bad cadres can also be replaced. Following the masses is never wrong." At that moment, I felt like I had seen the light of day. There is only one true principle.

    Once back in the village, I found Li Wensheng, Wang Wei, Li Rizeng, and other seven peasant association group leaders to hold a meeting (the three group leaders who were of one mind with Guo Wu were not called). I first asked: "Do you have any opinions about Guo Wu?" They said: "We do, but we don't dare to mention them!" I then said: "Mention them, I've already mentioned them in the county, and I'm not afraid of anything. I'll take responsibility if anything happens." Wensheng said: "Guo Wu has become the court, covering the sky with one hand and protecting the wealthy, and we can't be liberated." Bingquan interrupted: "Since becoming chairman, he hasn't worked in the fields, always assigning peasant association members to do it for him. What village has such a rule?" Wang Wei said: "His family had no wheat to eat, so he asked us to raise three dan for him. Which village doesn't pay grain to the military? But we have to pay this 'Chairman Grain'." They expressed their opinions with great enthusiasm. I said: "If we want to do it, let's do it. The county supports us, and if we unite, we can do it." Everyone decided to go back to their groups to mobilize for the recall of the peasant association chairman. The group leaders also both advocated for the members and mobilized them to raise their opinions about Guo Wu. As soon as the recall of Guo Wu was mentioned, everyone except the Li family said: "We've finally made it through." After recalling Guo Wu, they also calculated his embezzlement and immediately elected me. I said on the spot: "Everyone elected me, and I must first tell everyone: I am the chairman of the poor and must never become the chairman of the landlords like Guo Wu. I will lead everyone to work, and everyone will supervise me."

    The First Struggle Wasn't Done Well

    Not long after I became the chairman of the peasant association, I held a meeting to struggle against the Smiling Wolf. All the villagers came, but no one offered any opinions. Only those few dozen peasant association members shouted slogans. The meeting was so unenthusiastic that the Smiling Wolf smiled and said: "We are all from the same village, so we can always discuss things. I think everyone doesn't have any opinions. I am willing to take out thirty dan of wheat and twenty-five mu of land and give it to everyone." The struggle meeting turned into a "begging meeting." The Smiling Wolf's words were quite reasonable, and I snatched him: "We are settling the blood and sweat debt with you, we want what is ours, not what you give." I said to the masses again: "Are we extorting him?" "No!" No matter what, that's how it ended. At night, I lay on the bed, constantly thinking about the reason why the meeting didn't go well: first, we didn't first express our grievances and dig up the roots of poverty. If we don't pour out our grievances, we can't arouse enthusiasm. Second, there were too few people in the peasant association. In such a large crowd, more than half of the people had suffered from the local bullies, but the peasant association only accepted dozens of poor and lower-middle peasants. I felt this was really dangerous. Third, the peasant association wasn't clean. Landlord Li Lin'an, who was brought in by Guo Wu, hadn't been kicked out yet, and everyone was afraid to speak. I thought about it all night, couldn't fall asleep, and the more I thought about it, the more I realized it was right: those who suffer unite, there is strength in numbers, if the masses don't rise up, the landlords won't be afraid.

    I Won't Be Guo Wu

    Although the first time wasn't done well, the Smiling Wolf felt that I was a little scared. As soon as I got up, the Smiling Wolf stood on the ground: "Little Clown (Yichang's childhood name), my relationship with your father was good, can you say a good word for me, I'll never forget you." Saying that, he put down five hundred silver dollars for me: "If you are short of anything, my family can always try to help you." I couldn't help but get angry and threw the money back at him: "Are you trying to get me not to be the chairman of the peasant association?" Seeing that things weren't right, he turned around and left. The Smiling Wolf didn't give up and asked my old friend Li Yangquan to bring the money to me again: "Li Xianglin asked me to give you these five hundred yuan first, and later three thousand or two thousand won't be a big deal; smart people don't need to be told in detail, isn't he just trying to get you to say a good word for him." I said: "A dead child buried in the snow will eventually be exposed. You are my friend, are you trying to get me to be Guo Wu, you won't be satisfied until you harm me." I thought, if I spent his money, it would be like Guo Wu harming the whole village and preventing them from being liberated. This made me even more vigilant. "To die for the masses is never wrong," I am a lonely homeless fugitive. Now the masses have elected me as a hero to attend the meeting in Lu'an. I am really happy. I still say: "To die for the masses is never wrong."

    Peasant Unity, Wealth Reunion

    At the peasant association, I proposed: "Out of the two hundred households in our village, one hundred and eighty have been exploited. Only about sixty of us are participating in the peasant association, and our strength is not great, so the landlords are not afraid. In that day's struggle against the Smiling Wolf, everyone didn't say a word. We must open the door and let the middle peasants in." The poor peasants said: "Don't take them, we will struggle against them after struggling against the landlords; besides, if we let them in, we will have to divide the fruits into more shares." I said again: "Does the Smiling Wolf only bully us? Doesn't he also bully the middle peasants?" Everyone said: "Come to think of it, they have all suffered from the landlords." From the discussion, we realized that the middle peasants were also one life, they all shared the surname "Poor." On the first day, we held a meeting to recount grievances, and more than one hundred and twenty middle peasants also participated. Middle peasant Han Zhangshuan recounted his grievances, saying: "We are really in a difficult situation now. We and the landlords are also two different groups. We suffer the same pain as everyone, but the peasant association doesn't want us, so we have become orphans. In the past, when the Smiling Wolf lent money, we middle peasants were the guarantors. When the landlords squeezed the poor dry and fled, we were the ones who had to pay. The landlord's plot was a double-edged sword, killing you and dragging us down. Besides, I also borrowed money from Li Xianglin, and eight mu of my land were taken. When the 40th Army came to provide supplies, the landlords had power but didn't contribute, and the burden fell on our shoulders again. Guo Wu, as chairman, specializes in struggling against the middle peasants, and we are even more afraid. We all share the surname 'Poor,' we are all the same people." These words moved everyone's hearts. Using grievances to draw out grievances, the poor and middle peasants cried and recounted together. The firepower was all aimed at the landlords. In less than twenty days, the peasant association added one hundred and twenty new households, totaling one hundred and eighty households. Except for the landlords and rich peasants, everyone joined the association, and our strength increased hundreds of times. Even Guo Wu, who had transformed, was brought back into the peasant association.

    After the middle peasants joined the association, except for the landlords, the entire village united into a "knot." The second struggle meeting was very different. Everyone dared to recount their grievances, everyone offered opinions, they spoke when they wanted to speak, and they did what they wanted to do. Day and night, night and day, if blood and sweat couldn't be taken out, they would do it even if the sky collapsed.

    The masses knew the root of poverty and knew that when the majority organized to dig up the root of poverty, anything could be done well. In August, I went to Hui County to participate in the war, and the movement didn't stop, it was even better than when I was there. The masses are all heroes!

    The Smiling Wolf, One Tiger, and Staring-Eyed General can no longer sit on the heads of the poor and urinate. The blood and sweat of the poor sucked into the "cotton fluff hammer," five hundred mu of land returned home, more than ten thousand silver dollars returned home, two hundred houses returned home, and the twenty or so households who had fled also returned home, returned home, all returned home, land, silver dollars, houses, men, women, old and young reunited in one family. Everyone struggled, and everyone shared the fruits. Everyone got their fair share without a word of complaint. The poor moved into the brick buildings on the hammerheads, from the soles of their feet to the tops of their heads, they were thoroughly liberated, and they lived a good life.

    “弹花锤”
    我是林县上庄的，二十二岁，人们说我吃的胖敦敦，我是翻身后才长了这“翻身膘”。
    我村像个“弹花锤”，两边是一片高楼大瓦房，当中是土房草棚占的一条线，我就在当中住。“锤头人，锤头狠，两面锤头夹穷人。”北头有“笑面狼”李相林、“一只虎”李元，南头有“瞪眼将军”李栋。我爹揭了他们三十元钱，闯下“没底洞”，“老三分，驴打滚”，俺父子们十四只手受下付了利，“棉花包火”滚成二百元。我爹和哥们都着了慌逃到山西，留下我和娘还有个妹妹。笑面狼也着了慌，捞多少算多少，四亩地押了二亩，剩下二亩让“瞪眼将军”刮去，还拆了房上的梁椽，刨去墙脚的石头垒了地窖，娘气死了，妹妹卖了，全家净打光，我也讨吃到山西。全村二百户，一百八十户揭李家钱，走了我脚踪的三十户。“弹花锤，弹花锤，吃了当中肉，两头肥。”
    郭五没站稳
    林县解放了，县里撤了笑面狼，叫郭五当农会主席，因为他是穷人，第二天我就入了农会。郭五当主席，笑面狼送给他四亩地，隔不几天还给他送煤、红薯与白面，送去了总是那句话：“当了干部忙不过来，缺短啥到咱家拿，工作是要大家做嘛。”村长李五元也慢慢沾上了光。过了月把，调转了盘子，郭五和李五元常到笑面狼舌头上领话。别的村都斗起来了，笑面狼每天晚上总是睡不着，在想：“有郭五和五元，本村人是不好意思斗我，可是外村来斗就盖不住，不如以斗抵斗。”一天，叫上郭五与五元说：“邻村都开了会，咱村也不能不办，我是有啥给大家啥，可是不想把这碗水给外村人喝了，总想给了咱村人，本来不用开会，可是这个名声张出去才能抵住外村来。”郭五说：“对，对。”笑面狼笑了笑：“不过你二位还不知道，这几年我可也就没…………”没等说出，郭五就领会了：“那还能不照护，放心吧！”郭五接着就召开小组长动员：“李相林对咱村人不错，不想把东西给了外村，叫咱村群众开会解决一下，各通知各的会员明天开会。”试了几下没敢说的话，最后才说：“不过人家这样开明，咱们也得识个前后。”第二天会上，群众湾着头不吭，郭五一张一舞卖弄积极。最后算出二十石麦子十枝步枪，群众觉得还不少，准备走，郭五遭了慌，跺着脚：“不准走，不准走。”紧接就说：“李相林表现很开明，给他减去八枝枪同意不同意？”你看我，我看你不应声，“同意了就说句同意么！”大家七高八低的答了声“同意。”晚上，笑面狼预备了鸡蛋面条汤配蒸馍，小组长以上干部都请了去。饭间笑面狼照样一笑：“大家领导的会好，颜和面和，不像外村动手动脚的那惹人笑话！不过，我近几年来的光景大家是知道：……。”大家一下听出了请吃饭的心事，眼瞧眼没啥说，还是主席出头说：“相林也是困难，关于今天处理他的那两枝枪，再减去一枝，丢下那枝出上一万三千二百元（价是两万五）作了事，同意不？”吃了的嘴软，大家只好说：“同意。”
    那时咱是个会员，摸不着底细，不敢乱说，看着主席和笑面狼眉来眼去，抽地事就没提，大家都没提，误上工，翻不了身。破锣打着好响声，外村可传着上庄翻身闹的好，光枪就十枝哩！
    县里开干部会，特别通知我也去，郭五们带着蒸馍干粮，咱连糠窝也没有。会上郭五会报工作说：“俺村运动轰轰烈烈起来了，把恶霸都斗垮，农民翻身了。”郭五对我满招呼，怕我发言，我可偏要说：“到会干部都不吃恶霸面条，俺村干部就吃恶霸面条，斗三石，五斗解决，斗下十枝枪，减去八枝，吃了一顿，又减了一枝。”郭五红了脸，大家都看他，连脖子耳根也红了。县里老刘同志个别和我谈了四次话，我把村里情形告给他，他说：“你敢干不敢？”我说：“只要上级作主我就敢干。”他又说：“回去好好干，大胆干，坏干部也能撤换，跟住群众走永没错。”这一下我好像见了青天，真道理只有一个。
    一回村，我就找见了李文生、王维、李日增等七个农会小组长开会（和郭五一心的三个组长未叫）我先问：“你们对郭五有意见没有？”他们说：“有是有，可不敢提呀！”我又说：“提吧，我在县里已提了，啥也不怕，出了事我抵。”文生说：“郭五已成了朝廷，一手遮天，包庇老财，咱翻不了身。”炳全插了嘴：“自当了主席就不上地，总是拨农会员去给他做，人家那个村里还有这规矩？”王维说：“他家没麦子吃，叫咱给他募捐了三石，那个村也是交军粮，那交过咱这‘主席粮’。”他们说出了意见，劲头挺大，我说：“要干就干，县上给撑腰做主，咱再团结起来，就能行。”大家就决定各回各组动员罢免农会主席。小组长也是一面给会员做主，一面动员把对郭五的意见都提了出来。一说罢免郭五，除李家外，人人都说：“可熬出来了。”罢免了郭五，又算了他的贪污，马上就选起我来，我当场说：“大家选我，我就要先告大家说：我是穷人的主席，决不能像郭五成了地主的主席，我领导大家干，大家监督我干。”
    第一次没斗好
    我当了农会主席不几天，就开会斗争笑面狼。全村群众都到了，就是不提意见，喊口号也只是那几十个农会员，开得实在没劲头，笑面狼笑了笑说：“咱一村人，总也好商量，我看大家也没啥意见，我情愿拿出三十石麦子和二十五亩地，给了大家。”斗争会开成“要饭会”，笑面狼说的倒挺有理，我抢着给了他一下：“我们是向你算血汗帐，是要我们的，不是要你的。”我又向群众说：“我们是讹他不是？”“不是！”不管怎，就这样收场。黑夜我躺在坑上，一直想会没开好的根由：第一是没先诉苦刨穷根，倒不出苦水就引不起劲头。第二农会人太少，一大场人，就有多半大场人受过恶霸们的害，可是农会只要了几十个贫雇农，大部中农没进来，我觉这点实在危险。第三农会不干净，郭五拉进来的地主李林安还没踢出去，大家不敢发言。我想来想去，一夜没睡着，越想越对心：受苦的都团结，人多力量大，群众不起来，地主不害怕。
    我不当郭五
    头一次虽说没斗好，笑面狼觉着我有些怕，我刚起来，笑面狼就站在地下：“小丑（宜昌奶名），我和你爹不错气，你给哥垫句话，哥总忘不了你。”说着给我放下五百元大洋：“缺短啥到咱家总能尽量帮贴你些。”我不由的冒起火，把钱扔给他：“你不叫我当农会主席吧？”他看着不对头，转身就走。笑面狼心不死，托我的老朋友李阳全给我又把钱送来：“李相林叫先给你这五百元，以后三千两千不算啥；聪明人不必细讲，还不是想叫你给垫句话。”我说：“雪里埋死孩，终久要露出来，你是我的朋友，你想叫我当郭五，要害了我才甘心。”我想，我要花了他的钱，就又像郭五害得全村不能翻身。这下越警心了我，“至死为群众，永没错”，我是个孤独无家的逃荒孩孩，现在群众选我当了英雄，来潞安开会，我真高兴，我还是说：“至死为群众，永没错。”
    农民团结，人财团圆
    农会上我提出：“咱村二百户，就有一百八十户受剥削。参加农会的只有咱六十来户，力量不大，地主不怕，那天斗争笑面狼，大家不吭声，咱们要开门让中农也进来。”贫农说：“不要他们，斗完地主就要斗他们；再说，让他们进来，果实也得多分几份。”我又说：“笑面狼光收拾咱们？还收拾中农？”大家说：“说起来，是都受过地主的害。”从讨论中，认识了中农是一个命，都姓“穷”。第一天开拆苦会，一百二十余户中农的也参加，中农韩章拴诉苦说：“现在俺们真作难，咱和地主也是两路人，受得痛苦和大家一样，可是农会不要，成了没娘孩。以前笑面狼放钱，保人都是俺们这二不溜户，地主刮干穷人逃荒走了，就是我们垫，地主毒计是一箭双雕，打死你们，捎了俺们。再说我也揭过李相林钱，下了我八亩地。四十军过来起给养，地主们有势不出，穷人没有，担子又担在俺们肩膀上，郭五当主席专斗中农，俺越害怕。咱们都姓‘穷’，都是一路人。”这一番话，打动了大家的心，以苦引苦，中贫农一齐哭诉，诉中斗，斗中诉，火力都朝着地主射，不到二十天光景，农会新添了一百二十户，总共一百八十户，除了地主富农，都进了会，力量大了几百倍。就连转变了的郭五，又拉进农会来。
    中农进了会，除了地主，全村团结成一“疙瘩”，二次斗争会，情形大不同，人人敢诉苦，个个提意见，说喊就喊，说干就干。白天连黑夜，黑夜到白天，拿不出血汗来，天塌地崩也要干。
    群众知道了穷根，知道组织大多数起来挖穷根时，什么事也能办好。八月我去辉县参战，运动没停了，比我在还好，群众都是英雄呀！
    笑面狼，一只虎，瞪眼将军都不能坐在穷人头上撒尿了，吸到“弹花锤”头上的穷人血汗，五百亩土地回了家，一万多银洋回了家，二百间房子回了家，在外逃荒的二十来户也回了家，回了家，都回了家，土地、银洋、房子、男女老少团圆在了在一个家。大家斗，果实大家分，分得公道没句嫌话，穷人们搬在了锤头上住到砖楼院，脚底到头底，彻头彻尾翻了身，生产过好时光。
