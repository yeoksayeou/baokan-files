According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 30th, the strike involves employees of the China Tobacco Company, demanding a bonus equivalent to five months' wages, plus double pay for two months. Employees of a bakery company are demanding a monthly cost-of-living allowance of 150,000 yuan in addition to their regular income. Workers at the Shanghai Telephone Company are demanding a bonus equivalent to one month's salary in addition to advance salary payments and "special subsidies."
