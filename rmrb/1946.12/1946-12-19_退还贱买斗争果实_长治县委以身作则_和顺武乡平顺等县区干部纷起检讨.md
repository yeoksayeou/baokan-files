　　【Changzhi News from this newspaper】In order to thoroughly realize "land to the tiller" by filling gaps and making up deficiencies, county and district cadres in Changzhi, Heshun, Wuxiang, Pingshun, and other counties, displaying a high degree of awareness, are returning ill-gotten gains acquired cheaply during mass movements to help class brothers and sisters stand up. The Changzhi County Committee took the lead, influencing all cadres to examine themselves. They unanimously believe that this is a form of personal enjoyment ideology that directly hinders the emancipation movement. They are determined to return the cheaply bought gains to the masses and apologize to them. At the self-criticism meeting of cadres in Wuxiang County, the director of the County Military Commission took the lead as a model, influencing other comrades to return their ill-gotten gains. Comrade Zhao Santang said: "If I have an enjoyment-seeking and selfish ideology, the movement will not be successful. If I am not clean, I cannot speak to others. Only when I am clean can the movement be successful. I am determined to return everything to the masses completely and boldly help them stand up thoroughly." After reflecting on the issues of mass viewpoint and work style, the cadres in the overturning training class of the Seventh District of Pingshun all returned their cheaply bought gains to the masses. Heshun conducted a detailed self-criticism on the issue of cadres buying struggle fruits cheaply at a cadre meeting, tracing three sources of the generation of enjoyment-seeking thoughts: (1) Cadres were indeed struggling hard during the War of Resistance Against Japan, placing all their hopes for enjoyment in victory. After the victory of the War of Resistance, they believed that victory had been achieved and peace had come, so they should enjoy themselves. When the opportunity of the mass movement arose, hedonism occurred, forgetting that there was still a powerful reactionary group undermining peace in China. (2) Insufficient understanding of the power of the masses, believing that the movement was initiated by themselves, and the emancipation was achieved by themselves, so they deserved more credit than the masses and should enjoy themselves. (3) The development of selfish and self-interested thoughts, forgetting the origin of emancipation, blurred the class concept. The generation of this enjoyment-seeking thought not only corrupted themselves, but also produced three negative consequences for work: (1) The issue of whether or not to buy, and how much to buy, caused disunity among cadres. (2) The enjoyment and waste of local cadres caused dissatisfaction among military cadres towards the local government. (3) The actions of county and district cadres directly influenced village cadres and activists, corroding the cadres' sense of responsibility to the masses and lowering the cadres' prestige among the masses. After the self-criticism, it was unanimously believed that solving the cadre problem and closely linking cadres with the masses is the key to thoroughly sweeping away feudal forces. Everyone is determined to return the gains completely to the masses and personally conduct self-criticism and apologize at mass meetings. In order to solve the difficulties for cadres to return the gains, in addition to the internal assistance of various organs, it is also called on each cadre to raise a piglet to solve their own difficulties.

　　退还贱买斗争果实  长治县委以身作则
    和顺武乡平顺等县区干部纷起检讨
    【本报长治讯】为填平补齐彻底实现耕者有其田，长治、和顺、武乡、平顺等县县区干部，发扬高度自觉，退还群运中贱买的斗争果实，帮助阶级弟兄翻身。长治县委以身作则，影响全体干部纷纷检查自己，一致认为这是一种个人享乐思想，直接妨碍着翻身运动，决将贱买果实还给群众，并向群众道歉。武乡县区干部检讨会上县武委会主任首起模范，影响其他同志退出贱买果实。赵三堂同志说：“自己有个享乐自私思想，运动就搞不好，自己不清白，无法张嘴说人，只有自己清白，运动才能搞好，我决心完全退给群众，大胆地帮助群众把身翻透。”平顺七区翻身训练班，经过反省群众观念与作风问题后，均把贱买果实退给了群众。和顺对干部贱买斗争果实问题，在干部会上作了详尽检讨，追出产生享乐思想有三种根源：（一）抗战中干部确实艰苦，把享乐完全寄托于胜利，抗战胜利后，认为胜利了，和平了，应该享受，又遇上群运的机会，就发生享乐主义，忘了中国还存在着强大的破坏和平的反动派。（二）对群众力量认识不够，以为运动是自己搞起来的，翻身是凭自己，比群众功高，应该享受。（三）翻身忘本的自私自利思想发展，模糊了阶级观念，这种享乐思想的产生，不仅腐蚀了自己，而且对工作亦产生了三种恶果：（一）因为买上买不上和买多买少的问题，造成了干部之间的互相不团结。（二）地方干部的享受与浪费，引起军队干部对地方的不满。（三）县区干部的行动，直接影响了村干部与积极分子，腐蚀了干部对群众负责的观念，降低了干部在群众中的威信。经过检讨，一致认为解决干部问题，密切干部与群众关系，是彻底扫清封建势力的关键。大家决心把果实完全退还给群众，亲自到群众会上检讨认错。为了解决干部退出果实的困难，除由各机关生产内帮助一部外，并号召每个干部要喂口小猪，解决本身的困难。
