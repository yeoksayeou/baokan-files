　　Clarifying "Who We Work For"
    Explosives Factory Output Doubles
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to further expand the explosives movement, the Taihang Third Military Sub-district Military Affairs Committee's First Explosives Factory has seen both quality and quantity increase compared to two months ago. Starting in October, workers' ideological awareness greatly improved. Comrade Zhao Lin, after realizing that technology should serve the patriotic self-defense war, did not ask for leave to go home, and also urged others not to ask for leave. He said, "Frontline soldiers are not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, we should sweat more to guarantee the supply of ammunition." Workers Chunquan and others were the first to respond, declaring that they would not ask for leave to go home for half a year, and even had their winter clothes sent from home by letter. In order to improve output and strengthen quality, a system of centralized leadership and divided responsibility was adopted. For example, the thirteen workers and apprentices in the sand casting class were divided into three people to load sand, two people to make cores, one person to draw the furnace, one person to watch the fire color, and the rest to do odd jobs; and a special person was assigned to inspect each part to ensure that it was done well, and whoever made a mistake would be reviewed and criticized. This avoided the past phenomenon of shirking responsibility. Therefore, the output in October and November nearly doubled, and the quality was also good. At the end of last month, a large amount of raw materials was exchanged for bombs, and the output in December will exceed the previous two months again.

　　明确了“为谁干”观点
    爆炸厂产量倍增
    【本报讯】为进一步展开爆炸运动，太行三分区武委会第一爆炸所、质量数量，均较两月前提高。从十月开始，工人思想觉悟大为提高，工人赵林同志于明确技术应为爱国自卫战争服务后，自己不告假回家，也号召别人不告假回家。他说：“前方战士不怕流血牺牲，我们应该多流点汗，保证弹药供给”。工人春全等首起响应，宣称半年不告假回家，连过冬衣物也打信由家里捎来。为提高产量与加强质量，特采取集中领导，分头负责制度。如翻砂班十三个工徒，即划分开三人装砂，两个人打心子，一人抽炉，一人看火色，其余做杂活；并设专人检查，各部分都保证做好，谁出毛病检讨谁、批评谁。避免了过去互相推诿等不负责任现象。因此十、十一，两月产量几超过一倍，且质量又好，上月底更用炸弹换回大批原料，十二月份产量又将超过前两月。（三分武通讯小组）
