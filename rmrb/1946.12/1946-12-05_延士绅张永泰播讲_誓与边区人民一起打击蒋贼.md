　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Mr. Zhang Yongtai, a local gentry from this city, gave a speech on the Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station today, stating briefly: Ten years ago, Yan'an was still under the rule of the Kuomintang. I was forced to work as a Ba長 [local official]; but I dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out about the Kuomintang's tyranny. When the Red Army first came, I was very afraid; but they did not kill or rob people. I had more than 3,000 mu of land in the countryside, which was divided up by the Communist Party, and I had scolded the Communist Party for it. Later, the CPC personnel all reclaimed wasteland and cultivated the land, reduced the burden on the people, and called on the people to plant cotton and trees. The government also opened hospitals. My granddaughter-in-law entered the hospital to have a baby, and my son entered the hospital for medical treatment. They were not charged for medicine or food. The Eighth Route Army came and went many times, and never conscripted laborers or livestock. Government personnel at all levels were elected by the people, and I also had the right to vote and be elected. In the past, when the Kuomintang built airfields, they demolished houses, cut down trees and occupied land, without paying any compensation, and even dug up people's ancestral graves without providing for burial. Last year, when the Communist Party expanded the airfield, it paid subsidies for land occupation and tree cutting. In recent years, the division of labor for my family is: the daughter-in-law manages the household, the grandson Da Zhong opens a Da Zhong general store in the market with a capital of more than two million legal tender, and I also personally work, managing the vegetable garden. On August 15th this year, I took the fruits and grapes I grew to pay respects to Chairman Mao, and was warmly received. Before leaving, I was also given holiday gifts. The day before yesterday, we brought our homemade wine to congratulate Commander-in-Chief Zhu on his 60th birthday. Commander-in-Chief and Chairman Mao also kept us for dinner and watching a play, as close as family. Now I understand the glory of being a working person. Now that our border region people are just living in peace and working in contentment, with sufficient food and clothing, Chiang Kai-shek is jealous, and has received American munitions to fight a civil war, and wants to come and slaughter the border region people. My Zhang Yongtai family vows to stand together with all the border region people and the Eighth Route Army, to defend our homes, to defend Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and to fight to the end against the invaders! I hope that all compatriots and fair-minded gentry across the country will unite with us to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial policies. The Chinese people will surely be victorious. Although I am nearly seventy years old, I am still healthy, and I firmly believe that I can still see that good day.

　　According to: Mr. Zhang Yongtai was a scholar in the late Qing Dynasty and originally had more than 3,000 mu of land. After the land revolution, he still lives in Yan'an and now personally participates in farming and lives a prosperous life through business. On the fifteenth of August this year, he went to see Chairman Mao and spoke freely about his abundant food and clothing situation. Chairman Mao said, "You and Wu Manyou have the same good times, the difference between you and Wu is that you went from not working to working."

　　延士绅张永泰播讲
    誓与边区人民一起打击蒋贼
    【新华社延安二日电】本市士绅张永泰氏于今日在延安新华广播电台发表演说，略称：十年以前，延安仍是国民党的天下。我被迫做过保长；但对于国民党的暴政是敢怒而不敢言。红军初来时，我很害怕；但他们却不杀人，不抢人。我在乡间有地三千多亩，被共产党分光，曾骂过共产党。以后中共人员均开荒种地，减轻人民负担，并号召人民种棉植树，公家又开设医院，我孙媳进院养娃，儿子进院治病，服药吃饭均不给钱。八路军来去多少次，从未拉过民夫牲口。各级政府人员均由民选，我也有投票及被选权，往年国民党修飞机场，拆民房、砍树占地，均不给钱，甚至挖人祖坟，亦不予安葬。去年共产党扩大飞机场，占地砍树，均给补助费。几年以来，我一家人的分工是：儿媳管家，孙儿大忠在市场开设资本二百余万法币之大忠号杂货铺，我自己也亲自劳动，管理菜园。今年八月十五日，我带了自种的果子葡萄去与毛主席拜节，被亲切接待，临行还赠我节礼。前天我们又带了自作的葡萄酒给朱总司令拜六十寿诞，总司令、毛主席又留我们吃饭看戏，亲如家人，现在我已明白做劳动人民的光荣。现我边区人民刚安居乐业，丰衣足食，蒋介石就看了眼红，领了美国军火打内战，要来屠杀边区老百姓。我张永泰一家人誓与全边区人民及八路军站在一起，为保卫家乡，保卫毛主席和朱总司令，与进攻者干到底！希望全国同胞、全国公正士绅都一致起来，和我们一起反对蒋介石的卖国独裁政策，中国老百姓是一定能够胜利的。我虽年近七旬，但身体还健，深信我还能看见那个好日子。
　　　　
    按：张永泰先生系前清秀才，原有地三千余亩，土地革命后，仍留居延安，现亲自参加农作，并经商生活，甚为富裕。今年八月半，曾往见毛主席，畅述其丰衣足食情况，毛主席说：“你和吴满有过一样的好光景，你和吴不同的，就是从不劳动到劳动。”
