　　Drivers Active on the Self-Defense Front
    Wu Xiang
    On the Jilu豫 (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) battlefield, it is not only the infantry, cavalry, engineers, and artillery who are bravely resisting the Chiang army and constantly achieving brilliant victories, but also the drivers who control a considerable number of vehicles.

    A large truck, fully loaded with ammunition, sped towards the front line. Chiang's planes came and strafed it, bullets shattered the glass and pierced three holes in the driver's cotton coat, but the driver, Liu Baoqi, calmly drove the truck forward. After annihilating the entire Third Division, the driver, Liu Zhao, drove a large truck to pull back captured items such as tanks. At that time, Chiang's troops in the east were approaching, and the truck broke down. Liu Zhao repaired it as he went along the muddy autumn road, not sleeping for three nights. The car got stuck in the mud, and the engine stalled. He went down to crank the engine, using too much force, and the crank flipped back and broke his arm. He fainted. When he woke up, he still refused to leave the vehicle. Unable to use his right hand, he used his left hand to help others repair the machine.

    Most of these drivers, who faithfully serve the people, came from the Chiang army or Chiang-controlled areas. Liu Zhao had worked at the Northwest Highway Bureau, the Yunnan-Burma Highway Bureau, the Sixth Cavalry Regiment of the Kuomintang Logistics, and the Kunming Overhaul Factory of the Military Affairs Commission. He was an upright young man who couldn't stand disgusting things. He changed jobs eight times in eight years, but he could never relax. This April, he came to the Liberated Area. This time he fulfilled his hopes and found a good place to spend the rest of his life. He told me many corrupt truths about the Kuomintang transportation agencies. The Sixth Cavalry Regiment issued fuel based on mileage, stipulating ten and a half kilometers per gallon, but when the fuel reached the drivers, it couldn't even go six kilometers per gallon because the officers embezzled it. The embezzling officers shamelessly asked the drivers to compensate for the loss. As a result, drivers carrying private goods and passengers during business trips were tacitly approved by the officers, who even demanded a percentage of the profits. Liu Zhao said with emotion: "People see that drivers have a lot of perks, but they don't know that we also have unspoken sufferings!" Of course, many people developed bad habits such as stealing and excessive eating and drinking, becoming increasingly corrupt. But even these people, after joining the Eighth Route Army and receiving revolutionary education, quickly became loyal people's fighters. They often stayed up eight or nine nights without sleeping in times of war emergency, and after driving back in the middle of the night, they would repair the machines without rest. If a car traveling with them broke down, no matter how urgent the situation or how far the distance, they would never leave him alone. Seeing that the cadres were even more hardworking than themselves, they were unwilling to receive special treatment. Seeing that their skills were truly valued, they were determined to dedicate their skills to the revolution. The old driver Sun Shushan said: "I studied for three years before I learned how to drive and repair cars because my master was unwilling to teach me well. Now we are all revolutionary comrades, all serving the people. I must do my best to teach others and guarantee that they will learn in three months."

    In this way, many Eighth Route Army soldiers and young students from the Liberated Area joined the ranks of drivers, learning this skill. Wang Xichen was only seventeen years old, and his agility and effort made him a skilled jeep driver within five months. Cao Junfeng, who drove a US-made ten-wheel truck, used to be a guard. Wang Jiaoyao, the political commissar of the motorcade, studied technology in his spare time and is now a skilled driver.

    After capturing many American ten-wheel trucks from the American-equipped Chiang's Eleventh Division, the Fifth Army, and the Tenth Artillery Regiment, the motorcade appeared even more prosperous. The hands of the trainees and assistants, stained with oil, were terribly frozen, but they still crawled under the cars, disassembling the engines and tires with relish. They were unwilling to waste a minute of learning time. They knew that the counter-offensive was coming soon, and there were many good American cars of Chiang's army waiting for them to drive...

　　活跃在自卫前线的驾驶兵
    吴象
    在冀鲁豫战场上，英勇抗击蒋军，不断地取得辉煌胜利的，不仅是步兵、骑兵、工兵、炮兵，还有掌握着相当数量汽车的驾驶兵。
    一辆大卡车，满载着弹药向火线急驰，蒋记飞机来了，追着它扫射，枪弹打碎了玻璃，把司机的棉衣打穿了三个窟窿，但是司机刘宝奇，仍然镇静地驾驶着卡车前进。歼灭整三师之后，司机刘昭，开着一辆大卡车去拉坦克车等胜利品，当时东边的蒋军已经迫近，而车却又出了毛病，刘昭在秋雨泥泞的路上修修走走，走走修修，三晚上没有睡觉了，车又陷到泥里，火也灭了。他下去摇马达，用力太猛，马达翻过来击断了他的胳膊，他晕倒了，当他醒来，仍不肯离开车子，右手不能动，便用左手去帮别人修理机器。
    这些忠诚为人民服务的驾驶兵，大部是从蒋军或蒋管区过来的。刘昭在西北公路局、滇缅公路局，国民党辎骑六团、军委会昆明整修厂等处都工作过，他是个正直的青年，看不得太恶心的事，八年间他换了八个地方，但是始终不能松一口气。今年四月，他跑到解放区来了，这次他满足了自己的希望，找到可以终老于斯的好地方了。他告诉我许多国民党运输机关腐败的真相，辎骑六团发油是按路程计算的，规定十公里半一加仑，但油发到驾驶兵手里，一加仑却走不了六公里，因为官长从中贪污了，而贪污官长竟厚颜无耻的要驾驶兵赔偿损失，这样一来，驾驶兵出差时带私货私客，也就得到官长的默许，甚至还要按一定比例和他分红。刘昭感慨地说：“人家都看到开汽车的油水多，那里知道我们也是有苦说不出呢！”当然，也有许多人从此养成了偷窃、大吃大喝等不良习惯，日趋腐化堕落，但就是这样的人，在参加八路军接受革命教育之后，很快就变成忠诚的人民战士了，他们常常在战争紧急的时候，八九晚上不睡觉，半夜开车回来，总是不休息就修理机器，一同出差的汽车出毛病停止了，不管情况如何紧急，路程如何遥远，总不会让他单独留下。他们看见干部比自己还刻苦，都不愿受特殊优待，看到自己的技术真正得到器重，都决心把技术献给革命。老司机孙树山说：“我学了三年，才学会开车修车，因为师傅不肯好好教我。现在都是革命同志啦，都是为人民服务，我一定要尽心教人，保证三个月学会。”
    就这样，许多八路军的战士和解放区的青年学生，加入了驾驶兵的行列，学习这门技术。王希臣才十七岁，他的灵敏与努力，使他五个月内，已经变成了一个熟练的吉普车的驾驶员；开美国十轮大卡车的曹俊峰，过去是个警卫员；汽车大队政治委员王家尧，在工作之余学习技术，现在已经是一个熟练的司机了。
    从美械蒋军十一师，第五军及炮十团，缴获了许多美国十轮大卡车之后，汽车大队更显得欣欣向荣了。练习生和助手们染满了油污的双手，冻的不得了，但还要爬在汽车底下，津津有味地拆卸军机器和轮带。他们是一分钟学习时间也不肯放松的，他们知道马上就快要反攻，蒋军有许多好美国汽车等着他们去开……。
