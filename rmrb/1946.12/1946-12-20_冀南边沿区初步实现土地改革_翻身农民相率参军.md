　　【Report from Weixian on the 11th by our newspaper】After the initial implementation of land reform in the border region of the Second District of Southern Hebei, the emancipated peasants were filled with anger upon learning the news of Chiang Kai-shek's invasion of Southern Hebei. Young men eagerly enlisted in the army one after another, determined to "Defend Southern Hebei, Defend our Homeland!" On November 29th, 34 young men from the Fifth District of Gaotang eagerly stepped forward to the front lines. Jiang Xilian, the director of the Women's Association, personally saw her husband off to join the army, saying, "If we don't drive away Old Chiang, our good life is not guaranteed." The 34 heroes swore an oath: "We are determined to fight for the interests of the people of Southern Hebei. If Old Chiang dares to attack Southern Hebei, we will make him die on the soil of Southern Hebei." After conducting a "thinking session" in Dongzhao Village, Second District of Xin County, 11 young men enlisted in the army led by the village chief and militia instructor. Within seven days, 250 young men joined the army in the Sixth District. Wu Yunshan, director of the District Armed Forces Committee, led 35 militiamen to fight Old Chiang. Fan Huaide, director of the Shiliwu Farmers' Association, said, "I led the Farmers' Association members to achieve half of our emancipation. I am determined to lead the Farmers' Association members to completely defeat Old Chiang and achieve full emancipation." At that time, five Farmers' Association members joined the army with him. Wang Ruiyun, director of the Tianhai Farmers' Association, personally sent his younger brother to join the army. His eldest son had been discharged due to illness, so he sent his second son to fight Old Chiang. Ma Qinglu, a militia member from Mazhuang Village, requested to go to the front lines the day after his wedding. At the farewell rally for the entire village, he said, "If we don't eliminate Old Chiang, we won't even be able to protect our wives." Tian Jialin, a comrade from Liutang Village in Wucheng, heard that Old Chiang was going to attack Southern Hebei and went to the battlefield for the second time. All cadres and party members in En County fully demonstrated revolutionary heroism at the conscription mobilization meeting, unanimously proposing to work hard, vowing never to surrender or compromise, and to fight Old Chiang to the end. They are determined to work hard to mobilize 1,100 new soldiers. Currently, the conscription movement in the county is developing vigorously.
