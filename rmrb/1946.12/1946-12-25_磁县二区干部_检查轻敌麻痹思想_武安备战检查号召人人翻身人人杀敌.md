　　[Our Newspaper] The Cixian Second District held a meeting of over two hundred cadres and activists on the 5th to examine war preparations. It was found that the war mobilization was inconsistent, and cadres harbored serious thoughts of underestimating the enemy, complacency, and wishful thinking. Many people, based on the narrow experience of last year's Ci-Han campaign, thought that as long as the enemy entered, they could be eliminated with a "pocket battle." In particular, after the victory of the Hua County campaign last month, which repelled the enemy's plan to converge on Xingtai and Handan, they thought the Eighth Route Army's strategies were brilliant and the enemy wouldn't come, thus relaxing their fighting will. Meanwhile, special agents and landlords spread rumors, provoking discord between cadres and their families, affecting the emotions of the masses. After the meeting's self-criticism, combined with education on the masses' thoughts, they actively carried out war preparation activities.
    [Another Dispatch] Wu'an's war preparation inspection summarized and praised the Chongyi and Nanzhuang masses' experience in carrying out the stone mine (stone grenade) movement. Chongyi village cadres personally took action, leading the masses in the new district to practice with stone mines, creating a mass upsurge in mine practice. The entire district prepared more than 8,380 landmines for the invading Chiang army. They also universally organized mutual defense. A group of bad elements isolated by the masses were put under surveillance. The fourth district chief called for combining war preparation with rent reduction, proposing a "Everyone overturns the landlords, everyone kills the enemy" movement, believing that "leaving one obstacle is losing one strength," and "leaving one behind is leaving a tail"! It is necessary to rapidly mobilize all the peasants to carry out a kill-the-enemy and protect-the-home movement. (Rong Xian, Sun Jing, Jing Guo)

　　磁县二区干部
    检查轻敌麻痹思想
    武安备战检查号召人人翻身人人杀敌
    【本报讯】磁县二区五日特召开二百余干部积极分子会议，检查备战工作，发现战争动员时冷时热，干部思想存在严重轻敌麻痹侥幸心理。许多人根据去年磁邯战役狭隘经验，敌人进来只要一个“布袋战”就把他消灭了。特别是上月滑县战役胜利，打退敌人会师邢邯计划，以为八路军计谋高，敌人不会来了，因之松懈了战斗意志，而特务地主却从中造谣，挑拨干部与家属关系，影响群众情绪动荡。经过会上检讨，结合群众思想进行教育，积极进行备战活动。
    【又讯】武安备战检查总结，表扬了崇义、南庄群众开展石雷运动经验。崇义村干部亲自动手，带领新区群众练石雷，造成了群众性练雷热潮。全区给进犯蒋军准备好八千三百八十多颗地雷。并普遍组织联环保。把一部被群众孤立的坏人，讨保监视起来。四区区长号召把备战与查减结合进行，提出“人人翻身，人人杀敌”运动，认为“留一个圪道少一个力量”，留一个落后就是留一个尾巴”！要把全体农民迅速发动起来，开展杀敌保家运动。（荣先、孙经、靖国）
