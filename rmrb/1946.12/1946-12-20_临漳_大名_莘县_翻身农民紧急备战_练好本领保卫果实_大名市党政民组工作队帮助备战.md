[Dispatch from Weixian, 17th] After Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops occupied Qingfeng, Huilong, and Chuwang, the emancipated peasants of Linzhang have been clamoring for arms. In the Second District, over 500 peasants have voluntarily joined the militia. The militia of Village X has expanded from 20 to over 90 members. The 270 members of the entire district have gathered for ideological education, practicing techniques such as shooting, throwing grenades, and laying mines, awaiting the opportunity to move out and fight guerrilla and mine warfare against Old Chiang.

Daming City, to adapt to the war environment, has established a command headquarters. Party, government, and civilian cadres are unified into work teams to help the masses evacuate supplies and implement a scorched-earth policy. At the same time, they are reorganizing the militia, and the three reorganized echelons are actively learning how to lay mines, preparing to launch an explosion campaign. The remaining militia are undergoing intensive training, from which they are raising their political awareness and purging individual bad elements. Currently, the people of the entire city have high confidence. Militiamen say, "If we fill the city with landmines, if the enemy dares to attack Daming City, we will blow them up in the city!" A merchant said, "We'll take everything away. If the enemy dares to come, let them first eat the militia's landmines!" The military and civilians of Chengci County are also urgently preparing for war. The masses are busy emptying their houses and hiding grain, and the Armed Forces Committee is actively training the militia, coaching them in techniques such as throwing grenades, shooting, and laying mines, preparing to launch a county-wide explosion campaign.

[Another Dispatch] In Mazhai Village, Fourth District of Shen County, in response to the call to practice martial arts, the militia rises automatically every day at dawn to run and practice throwing grenades, shooting, and other actions. The self-defense forces gather in the fields every afternoon for drills in carrying stretchers and quickly shrinking targets, preparing to participate in the war.
