    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th. The late Mr. Tao Xingzhi initiated the organization of the Chinese International Human Rights Guarantee Association during his lifetime. To fulfill Mr. Tao's unfinished wish, prominent figures from all walks of life in Shanghai and international peace-loving democrats and progressives held the inaugural meeting of the association at the Shanghai Youth Canteen on the afternoon of the 9th of last month. Ms. Liu Wang Liming was publicly elected as chairman. In her speech, Ms. Liu Wang Liming elaborated on the association's purpose: to investigate various facts of human rights exploitation, reveal the truth, and unite democratic and progressive people and groups around the world to fight against the remaining fascist forces. General Li Jishen delivered a speech at the meeting, stating: Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary goal was to guarantee human rights. This kind of international organization is even more important today, when history is in danger of being dragged into a dark stage. Zhang Bojun said in his speech: Guaranteeing human rights is the basic condition for a democratic country to stand. If human rights are not guaranteed, other armistices and national congresses are in vain. Zhang Naiqi said: It is very tragic that our people are still struggling to win basic freedoms today. From now on, the association will have heavy responsibilities and many difficulties ahead. We must unite and shoulder the mission of the times. Finally, the constitution was adopted, and Li Jishen, Bao John Bao, Zhang Naiqi, Liu Wang Liming, Ma Xulun, Shi Liang and others were elected as directors.

    反对法西斯蹂躏人权
    中国国际人权保障会成立
    李济琛刘王立明等当选理事
    【新华社延安六日电】已故陶行知先生，生前曾发起组织中国国际人权保障会。上海各界名流和国际爱好和平民主进步人士，为完成陶先生未竟遗志，特于上月九日下午假座上海青年食堂，召开该会成立大会，公推刘王立明女士主席。刘王立明女士在致词中阐述该会宗旨，为调查各种剥削人权事实，揭露真象，联合全世界民主前进之人士及团体为反对法西斯残余势力而斗争。李济琛将军在会上发表演说，略谓：孙中山先生革命目的即在保障人权，当历史有被拉入黑暗阶段危险的今日，此种国际性组织更为重要。章伯钧发言谓：保障人权为民主国家立国基本条件，若人权无保障，其他停战开国民大会均属徒然。章乃器称：我们人民今天尚为争取基本自由而挣扎，这是很悲惨的，今后本会责任重大，前途困难很多，我们要团结一致，负起时代的使命。最后通过简章，并推选李济琛、鲍约翰保、章乃器、刘王立明、马叙伦、史良等为理事。
