　　Please Lin County Eleventh District Pay Attention to Caring for the Wounded Soldiers

　　Our glorious wounded soldiers returning to the rear have been warmly welcomed and comforted by the masses along the way. However, when passing through Rencun, Eleventh District of Lin County, a large number of wounded soldiers did not receive boiled water or any attention. We had previously sent someone with a letter from the responsible comrade asking the district to prepare stretchers to transport the wounded soldiers. The district cadre replied with a note saying there were no stretchers. Our Director of the Health Department repeatedly negotiated, but the district still refused to transfer them. The next day, the stretchers from the Twelfth District had to be carried all the way to She County. Second, in Shigang Village in the district, many seriously ill and wounded soldiers could not eat rice due to their severe injuries, and they could not get noodles. The district also did not help to quickly transfer them to the rear hospitals for treatment. Third, the weapons of the wounded soldiers were being transported from the hospital to the rear, but were stopped at Gucheng Village in the Eleventh District and could not proceed, because the district public office uniformly allocated livestock. We negotiated, but they refused to give us any, so they still cannot be delivered. It is right for the village cadres of the district to implement the system, but it should not be rigid; they must first solve specific problems. Otherwise, it may affect combat. I am writing this letter to raise this issue, hoping they will correct this practice as soon as possible. (Wang Wei)

　　Editor's Note: From this issue onwards, we are adding a "Everyone Talks" column, specifically for readers to speak out and offer opinions. Feel free to voice criticisms and suggestions, but please note: firstly, they must be consistent with the facts; secondly, they must be constructive. If criticisms and suggestions are incorrect, everyone can also discuss them. Taking this article as an example, if the cadres of Rencun Eleventh District believe it is not consistent with the facts and they have their difficulties, they can write to state their case, and we will be happy to publish it. When everyone has communicated clearly, we can do our work even better in the future.

　　请林县十一区注意招呼伤兵
    我光荣负伤的子弟兵返回后方，沿途受到群众热烈欢迎与慰问。但是路过林县任村十一区时，大批彩号却没有喝到开水，受到招呼。我们事前曾经派人持有负责同志的信请该区准备担架，转送彩号。该区干部回一纸条说没有担架。我们卫生处处长再三交涉，该区仍不转送。第二天，十二区担架只好一直送到涉县。第二、在该区石岗村住之彩病号，很多重彩号不能吃饭的，吃不上面。该区也不帮助迅速转运到后方医院治疗。第三、彩号之武器由医院往后方运送，到十一区古城村就停止不能前进，原因是该区公所统一分配牲口，我们交涉，又不肯给，以致到现在尚不能送到。该区村干部执行制度是对的，但不可呆板，必须首先解决具体问题。不然恐将影响作战。谨写信提出，希望他们早日改正这种作风。（王维）
　　　        
    编者按：从本期起，我们增添“大家谈”一栏，专门供读者同志来发言提意见，有批评有建议尽管放口，但须注意：一要合乎事实；二要带建设性。批评建议得不对的，大家也可以讨论。就拿本期的一篇来说，如果任村十一区干部认为不合事实，有其困难，可来信声述，我们也乐于登出。大家谈通了，以后好把工作作得更好。
