　　Jinan Third Prefectural Committee Instructs All Counties
    To Establish Professional Cadres
    To Strengthen Communication Work
    [Reported from Weixian on the 20th by our newspaper] In order to strengthen communication and reporting work for the self-defense war, the Jinan Third Prefectural Committee specially notified the propaganda departments of all counties, pointing out the following points: 1. According to the current development of the situation, it is necessary to rapidly strengthen war reporting work. Each county should immediately establish professional communication cadres. Linzhang and Handan counties, which have not yet established them, should quickly extract cadres suitable for this work to establish professional communication work; the leadership should help them to arrange and carry out the work. 2. All relatively comprehensive and important work summaries of the whole county must be copied in duplicate and sent to Jinan Daily and People's Daily. The communication officer shall be responsible to the above two party newspapers. 3. At present, our Linzhang and Weixian counties have begun the self-defense war, and other counties have also turned to emergency war preparation work. In the near future, they may turn to self-defense war. For this reason, the Prefectural Committee decided that self-defense war and enlistment, war preparation, eliminating traitors, and logistics work are the reporting center for all counties in our region in the future. In addition to quickly establishing professional communication officers, each county should also arrange communication and reporting work when arranging various war mobilization work. When counties, districts, and small districts or armed work teams and militia summarize their work, they should designate someone to write articles. Party committees in each county, especially leading cadres, should take the lead and do this work well.
