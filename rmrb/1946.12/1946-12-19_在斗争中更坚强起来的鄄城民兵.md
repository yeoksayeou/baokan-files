The eighty-mile stretch of rolling yellow sand along the Yellow River滩, with two winding dikes traversing the entire county, defines Juye County's topography. Villages are lush with green willow groves, interconnected by anti-Japanese trenches. The masses who have turned themselves around here have established their own armed force—the militia. For eight years during the War of Resistance Against Japan, they steadfastly defended their positions. In this patriotic self-defense war, they contributed significantly to the battles of Longhai, Dayang Lake, Zhangfengji, and southern Juye. However, when the enemy occupied Juye, they temporarily retreated. Witnessing the cries of those fleeing their homes, recounting the Kuomintang troops'疯狂 (mad) rape and the "Homecoming Corps'" ubiquitous extortion, looting, and conscription, they could no longer endure it. "If we don't fight, can we really hide?" Everyone wanted to fight back. Once the decision was made, solutions emerged. The militia snuck in at night, both to visit and to scout. At this time, the Kuomintang troops were瘋狂 (madly) seizing grain. We secretly transported public grain to safe locations at night. On the 15th of last month, five militiamen fired a volley of shots at Zhang Village in the river area, scaring away more than forty enemies. The next day, they learned that Kuomintang troops were going to Xinqi Village to seize grain, so they ambushed a platoon at Dongli Village. As soon as the Kuomintang troops appeared, they opened fire, killing three on the spot and seriously wounding a captain. Because it was daytime and their first engagement, they didn't dare to seize the weapons. Afterwards, the masses reported, "The enemy didn't remove the bodies until the afternoon, and the wounded captain died in the city." Upon hearing this, the militia were both happy and regretted not seizing the weapons. They held a celebration the next day and rewarded combat models. Suddenly, the masses reported again, "The enemy has taken away six large carts of grain from Xinqi Village, and they're not far away." Everyone was even more enraged. Guang Sheng, Wei Zhou, and Zhang Xi, three children aged fifteen or sixteen, ran up. When the enemy saw the militia coming, they abandoned the carts at Zhao Village and fled. The masses said, "If they had been attacked a little earlier, the enemy would have dropped their guns." The militia of the Fifth District achieved three victories, and everyone was encouraged to fight brilliant battles. On the 22nd, five brave men, taking advantage of the fortifications dug by a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army at Sulou, attacked the advancing Kuomintang main force, killing a sentry. The enemy was furious and shelled the village for half a day, even firing three small cannons. The five had already run back. The Sixth District militia had more men and better guns. One company was stationed in the rear, and another was burying grain in the district. Initially, they were also timid. The first time, four of them were chased by two Kuomintang soldiers for quite a distance. They felt, "This is too embarrassing, let's turn around and fire a few shots." They fired, and the enemy also turned around and ran. "So, you're very afraid of death!" The four advanced several more miles. On one occasion, a "Homecoming Corps" member's grenade string was kicked off by a chicken they had抓 (grabbed). The grenade exploded, wounding seven or eight. They thought the Eighth Route Army had arrived and ran away, leaving the wounded behind. Upon hearing these stories, the militia understood the situation and began to take action. The western Juye militia also showed no weakness. When the enemy was destroying Dongkou Chengji, they cooperated with the main force and打 (attacked), killing two and wounding three Kuomintang soldiers. The next night, they cut over ten miles of the Kuomintang's power lines. The militia of the Second District were commended, and the militia of the Seventh District were also mobilized, ambushing the enemy at Anle Village, rescuing our village cadres who were being吊打 (hung up and beaten) at Duan Village, killing a traitor at Jinzhuangzhai, and capturing two Kuomintang sentries alive at Dong Yugu. The Ninth District militia插 (inserted themselves) right up to the edge of the city, forcing the enemy's several strongholds to withdraw into the city. On the 23rd, all the enemies in the county had withdrawn. The militia in each district, were eager to show what they could do, saying, "Just when the fighting was getting lively, the lambs left." The militia learned from this struggle and resolved never to leave their local area and become separated from the masses again. Now they are discussing: even if the Yellow River collapses, turning the eighty miles of rolling yellow sand into rolling yellow water, they will be "white stripes in the waves" because they have been able to cross the Yellow River since they were young, and now they are even stronger.

　　在斗争中更坚强起来的鄄城民兵
    鲁西良
    八十里黄沙起伏的黄河滩，两条弯曲的大堤，纵贯着全县。全县的村庄都是浓绿绿的柳丛，各村之间，有纵横的抗日壕沟，这是鄄城县的地形。在这里翻了身的群众，建立了自己的武装——民兵，抗战八年一直坚持着自己的阵地，在这次爱国自卫战争中，他们在陇海、大杨湖、张凤集和鄄南大战，曾出了很大的力。但当敌人进占鄄城时，他们一时撤了出来，眼望着从家乡逃出来的人哭诉着蒋军疯狂的奸淫，“还乡团”到处勒索抢掠抓丁的罪行，他们再也不能忍耐了，“非打不中，躲能躲得过去吗？”大家都要打回去，决心一下，生出了办法，民兵夜里钻进去，也是探望，也是侦察。这时蒋军正疯狂的抢粮，我们就在夜里把公粮运到妥善的地方。上月十五日，五个民兵到河里张庄去打了一排枪，把四十多个敌人吓跑了。第二天又探得蒋军要到新起庄去抢粮，便把一个排埋伏在东李屯。蒋军一露头便开了枪，当场打死三个，一个队长受了重伤，因为是白天，又是初次打，没敢去摘枪，事后群众报告说：“敌人下午才把死尸拉走，伤的队长到城里也死了”。民兵听说，一面是喜欢，一面是后悔没摘了枪。第二天开会庆祝，并奖励战斗模范。忽然群众又报告说：“敌人把新起庄的粮食拉走了六大车，还不多远。”大家的气更高，广生、维周、张喜三个十五六岁的小孩子，都跑步上去了，敌人一看民兵来了，把大车丢在赵庄就跑回去，群众说：“如果再早打一会儿，敌人就把枪放下了。”五区的民兵获得了三次胜利，每个人心里都鼓舞地要打漂亮仗。五位壮士在二十二日那天凑着苏楼八路军某部挖的工事，向出发的蒋军主力打了一下，打死了一个前哨，敌人火了，一连向村里打了半天炮，连三响的小炮也打炸了，他五个早就跑回来了。六区民兵的人多枪好，一个连放在后方，一个连到区里埋粮，最初也是胆小，开始的第一次是四个人，被蒋军两个兵赶着跑了好远，自觉“这样太丢人，回头打两枪吧。”一打，敌人也回头跑，“原来你们怕死的很呵！”四个人又前进了好几里。有一次“还乡团”抓的鸡把自己的手榴弹弦蹬断了，炸弹响了，炸伤了七八个，他们以为是八路军来了，连伤号丢了就跑。民兵听到这些事就摸了底，于是活动开了。鄄西的民兵也不示弱，在敌人破坏董口成集的时候，配合主力打了一下，打死蒋军两个，打伤三个。第二天夜里又割了蒋军十几里的电线。二区的民兵受了表扬，七区的民兵也发动起来，埋伏在安乐庄打敌人，在段庄解救下我们正被吊打的村干部，在金庄寨打死一个汉奸，在东于固活捉蒋军两个哨兵。九区民兵一下就插到城边，敌人的几个据点被迫撤进城。在二十三日全县的敌人都撤走了，各区民兵都磨拳擦掌的说：“才打热闹，羔子们就走了。”民兵从这次斗争中长了经验，以后决不再离开本地区脱离群众了。现在他们正谈论着：即便是黄河垮了，把八十里起伏的黄沙变成起伏的黄水的时候，他们有的是“浪里白条”，因为从小他们就能横渡黄河，而今他们更壮大了。（冀鲁豫分社）
