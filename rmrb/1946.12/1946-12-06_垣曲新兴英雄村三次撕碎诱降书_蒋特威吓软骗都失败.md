　　The Heroic Village of Xinxing in Yuanqu Tears Up Three Enticement Letters: Chiang Kai-shek's Special Agents' Threats and Soft Deceit All Fail
    [This newspaper's Taiyue, 4th dispatch] On the mountains southwest of Yuanqu, there is a village composed of eighty or so mountain hamlets. This is the famous heroic village of "Xinxing." It is separated from the Huanghe River ferry at Wufujian by Feng'er Mountain to the south, and borders Pinglu and Xia counties to the southwest. This village has produced countless heroes, especially the Kang Detachment, which persisted in guerrilla warfare in southern Shanxi for eight years during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, the people underwent a struggle for emancipation and became even stronger. After Chiang Kai-shek's army occupied Yuanqu, it sent special agents such as Liu Hansan to entice them to surrender three times, but they were righteous and unafraid, and unmoved. The following is an account of their refusal to surrender: (1) At the end of August, the local guerrilla forces, government, and militia of the Fourth District were pushed north of the Jiangyuan Highway by Chiang Kai-shek's large forces. Only the heroic "Xinxing" village remained south of the road, fighting against Chiang Kai-shek's army. Special agent Liu Hansan and Chen Shaoting entered the Feng'er Mountain area and occupied the ridges of the First Hamlet. First, they spread rumors to confuse the public, saying, "Your County Magistrate Ren and Instructor Gao have been captured, and the Eighth Route Army has been defeated..." At first, these rumors did cause unrest in the village. Some believed them to be true and mourned County Magistrate Ren, some were suspicious, and some were panic-stricken. However, Village Instructor Feng Ziming, Militia Committee Director Xue Zhongyi, Village Director Li Zhanbiao, and others knew that these were rumors spread by the special agents. They convened a village-wide meeting to expose Liu Hansan's trick, and the villagers calmed down. Feng Ziming and others immediately organized the militia to take responsibility for establishing contact with the north of the road. The next day (August 28), a letter with Liu Hansan's name written on it was sent from the First Hamlet. The letter said: "We fully understand everything in your village. We will not mention anything about the Eighth Route Army being here in the past. In order to prevent you from suffering significant losses, please bring your guns and come to make contact as soon as possible. We guarantee your safety of life and property." As soon as the letter was read, it was torn to pieces. Everyone said, "Don't be afraid, we grew up in struggle." Later, Liu Hansan colluded with Xue Zhongzhi (brother of Zhongyi Han), a usurer in the village, and plotted for Xue Zhongyi to surrender with his gun. On the contrary, Xue Zhongyi exposed this matter. At this time, the whole village was busy preparing for war. In the afternoon, special agent Liu Hansan led a team to "suppress bandits." The sharpshooters and explosive experts of the "Xinxing" village, and all kinds of heroes, lurked in their battle positions in the jungles and shrubs, waiting for Liu Hansan to appear, and began a magical cold gun battle. One shot from the east, one shot from the west, put Liu Hansan, this robber, in a desperate situation with enemies on all sides. At dawn, Liu Hansan and others fled in embarrassment. (2) After Liu Hansan's failure, Chen Shaoting boasted to his superior, "It's easy to disintegrate these people, but unfortunately I have no one under my command, and my heart is willing but my strength is insufficient..." So the superior agreed to send him a batch of troops. Chen Shaoting brought thirty-six people and first gave a show of force. He wrote a letter to the "Xinxing" village saying, "Under orders to follow the army to collect 20,000 catties of newly assigned flour and 500 pairs of shoes. If they are not delivered within three days, they will be considered disobeying orders and will be conquered." This letter was also torn to shreds and trampled underfoot. Chen Shaoting suddenly attacked the First Hamlet in the dark, robbed eleven cattle, and arrested twelve people, intending to use this as a condition for "confiscating guns and accepting surrender." This matter was quickly learned by militiaman Li Fuliang, who was so angry that he trembled all over. He put down the half-bowl of rice he hadn't finished eating and immediately led ten or so people to rush over. Chen Shaoting had robbed the cattle and was gleefully cooking when Li Fuliang and ten or so people jumped over and attacked. Militiaman Xi Junfeng first knocked down two enemies, then knocked down a few more. Chen Shaoting and others fled in panic, slipped down the cliff, and ran away. In addition to recovering the cattle and people, they also captured two rifles. (3) After this serious blow, Chen Shaoting was dejected. Liu Hansan advised him, "You have to be patient with these people, you can't be too impatient..." The two discussed another plan, and through the First Hamlet Chief Chen ××, they sent another letter of enticement. In a gentle tone, it said: "The previous dispatch of 20,000 catties of white flour, 500 pairs of shoes, and the detention of people and livestock were purely due to a momentary emotional impulse. This time, we apologize to you, and openly assign your village 800 catties of white flour and 52 pairs of shoes, which is not excessive, right! We hope that you will deliver the above two newly opened items and the two rifles left behind on schedule. Please do not delay...." The shamelessness and incompetence of the special agents were completely exposed at this point. Feng Ziming and the others still ignored them. "Please do not delay," but it has been delayed for more than two months now, and Liu Hansan and these people dare not step into Xinxing Village again. (Yan Jin)

　　垣曲新兴英雄村三次撕碎诱降书
  　蒋特威吓软骗都失败
    【本报太岳四日电】垣曲西南山上，有个由八十来个山庄结成的村子，这就是闻名的“新兴”英雄村。南隔冯儿山与黄河渡口五福涧，西南平陆夏县交界。这个村庄产生过无数的英雄，特别是抗战八年，坚持晋南游击战争的康支队。胜利以后，人民又经过翻身斗争，更坚强起来了。蒋家军队进占垣曲后，就派出特务刘汉三等三番五次的来诱降，可是他大义凛然，不为所动，下面就是拒绝诱降书的一段事迹：（一）八月底四区地方游击队、政权、民兵被蒋军大部队压到绛垣公路以北，路南只剩下英雄的“新兴”村与蒋军斗争着。特务刘汉三与陈绍庭进到冯儿山地区，占领了第一闾的山岭，首先造谣惑众的说：“你们的任县长和高指导员被俘了，八路军都打垮了……”。开始这些谣言确实使这个村子不平静起来，有的信以为真，痛惜任县长，有的怀疑，也有的恐慌。可是村指导员冯子明、武委会主任薛忠义、村主任李占彪等知道这是特务造谣，他们召开了全村大会，揭露特务刘汉三诡计，村里人也就稳下来。冯子明等立即组织起民兵，负责去路北接上关系，第二天（二十八日）由一闾传来了一封写着刘汉三名字的信，信里说：“你们村里的一切事情，我们完全明白。过去八路军在这里，什么话都不提了，为不使你们受到重大损失，请赶快携枪过来接头，保证你们生命与财产的安全”。这信刚念完就被撕成碎片了。大家说“不怕，咱们是从斗争中长大的”。以后刘汉三又勾结上该村高利贷者薛忠志（忠义汉的哥哥），阴谋活动薛忠义携枪投降。相反的薛忠义却把这件事情揭露了。这时全村人忙碌起来，准备着战争。下午特务刘汉三带着队伍来清剿匪“新兴”村的神枪手、爆炸手、各色各样的英雄潜入自己在丛林、灌木中的战斗岗位，待刘汉三出现时，开始了神奇的冷枪战，东一枪、西一枪，使刘汉三这位强盗陷于四面楚歌，进退两难的绝境中。天明，刘汉三等才狼狈退出。（二）刘汉三失败后，陈绍廷向他长官夸说：“瓦解这些人容易，可惜我手下无人，心有余而力不足……”于是长官答允给他派上一批队伍，陈绍廷带了三十六个人首先来个下马威，他给“新兴”村写了一封信说：“奉命随军催收新派面粉两万斤，鞋子五百双，延期三日不交，即以违抗命令征伐”，这封信同样被撕成破片，被人们踏在脚底下，陈绍廷突然在黑夜袭入第一闾，抢走了牛十一头，抓去了十二个人，拟以为“缴枪收降”的条件。这件事很快被民兵李福良知道了，气得浑身发抖，放下没有吃完的半碗饭，立刻带上十来个人赶去。陈绍廷抢了牛，正在得意洋洋的做饭吃，李福良十来个人跳过去就打，民兵席俊峰先打倒两个敌人，接着又打倒几个，陈绍廷等抱头鼠窜，从崖上溜下去逃跑了。除夺回牛和人，还缴了两支长枪。（三）经过这次严重打击后，陈绍廷垂头丧气，刘汉三劝他说：“对这些人得耐心，不能太心急，……”两人又商量了一套办法，通过一闾长陈××，又送过来一封诱降信。用缓和的口气说：“前次所派白面两万斤，鞋五百双，及扣人和牲口事，纯系一时感情冲动所致，此次向你们道歉，并正大光明的给你村派白面八百斤，鞋子五十二双、不为过份吧！希按期将以上新开两项及所遗步枪两支交来，千万勿误。……”特务的无耻与无能，至此完全暴露了。冯子明他们还是不理，“千万勿误”，到现在已误了两个多月，刘汉三这些人却不敢再踏进新兴村一步了。（言谨）
