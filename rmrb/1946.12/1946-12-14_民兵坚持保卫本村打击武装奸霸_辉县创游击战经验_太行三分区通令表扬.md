[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] The development of mass guerrilla warfare in Huixian County has recently been commended by the Taihang Third Military Sub-district. To understand certain leadership experiences, this reporter visited Comrade Liu Xirui, Deputy County Magistrate of Huixian County, who recently arrived in Wu'an, on the evening of the 8th. The answers are as follows:

In mid-October, when Chiang's troops invaded the Bobi District of Hui County while attacking Jiaozuo, mass guerrilla warfare was able to develop rapidly, persisting in the entire position of about thirty villages in the Bobi area, constantly打击 and消耗ing the enemy, and achieving multiple victories. This was because we corrected some errors in the leadership of guerrilla warfare since the end of last autumn and solved some important problems. First of all, the most important thing is to solve the content of guerrilla warfare, and to solve the question of "who to fight for" and "who to fight." In the past, we often said that guerrilla warfare should be mass-based and protect the interests of the masses; but the opposite was true in practice. We had the erroneous ideological style of not trusting the masses, not trusting the militia, and not letting everyone rise up to protect themselves, but taking care of everything by the leadership. As soon as the enemy attacked, we gathered the militia of each village to the joint defense or district headquarters, leading them and controlling them; we were afraid that the militia would not be firm, and felt that there would be chaos in each village under the village cadres. But the result of concentration was that the masses in each village lost their armed backbone. At the sound of gunfire, they ran away at the sight of a few enemies. They could not produce during the day and dared not sleep at home at night. Because the militia队 could not find the masses, they could not gather intelligence and could not actively打击 the enemy. During the day, they blindly "guerrilla" in front, only able to go to a few villages. The enemy's armed special agents could still enter and exit many villages. The masses hated them to the bone, but they could do nothing. At night, the militia隊 retreated to the rear to camp, a large target, easily detected by the enemy, and often in danger of being raided. The sentry was exhausted and overwhelmed. The fundamental reason was that guerrilla warfare was turned into the business of leading organs, cadres, and militia队, the backbone was separated from the masses, the masses had no backbone, and guerrilla warfare was actually divorced from the needs and interests of the masses. At the beginning of the enemy's attack in October, we were also trapped in this situation for seven or eight days, repeating historical lessons. But this time we studied these lessons more timely and resolutely dispersed the militia of each village to each village, combining with the masses to persist in the position. At the same time, it was clearly determined that the main task of the militia in each village was to打击 the armed traitorous landlords and special agents of the Home-Coming Corps in each village, and the method was to let the masses打 them themselves. We guided the militia to discuss and clarified that "we have more people and more guns than the traitorous landlords and can fight," which strengthened our determination to win. After the dispersion, the militia played a role among the masses. First of all, the intelligence work was greatly strengthened. The militia in Li湾, Lao磨庄 and other places in the Ninth District not only figured out the enemy's action rules, but even figured out what kind of guns and bullets each traitorous landlord of the Home-Coming Corps carried, and whether they were good or not. The successful ambush at the end of October, which captured Zhang Tiande alive and killed four other traitorous landlords of the Home-Coming Corps, was a direct result of this dispersion. In general villages, due to the combination of the militia and the masses, they also felt "bright-eyed"; the sense of responsibility, initiative, and creativity were developed, and the "weapon-only" theory was overcome. In the past, they could not fight without machine guns, but now landmines and stone mines are being used. Small groups of enemies are打击ed everywhere and dare not act rashly. The Home-Coming landlords and armed special agents no longer dare to enter the villages casually, and the situation quickly stabilized.

Directly related to this, we greatly strengthened the role of the village headquarters. According to several years of experience, the village headquarters is the fundamental link in leading guerrilla warfare, but in the past, we neglected it. Once the militia was concentrated, the village headquarters actually became an empty headquarters, and had to run away with the masses, or follow the militia to concentrate, abandoning the masses. This time, we turned the village headquarters into a real headquarters for commanding the militia to fight,侦察 intelligence, and commanding the masses to prepare for war and transfer. These three parts of the work are all handled by dedicated personnel, and with a certain organization and task, they can be quickly carried out. A significant achievement is the successful completion of the three major tasks of harvesting rice, planting wheat, and hiding grain (these had not been done when the enemy attacked). In general villages, the militia guards the哨, the cadres lead the masses to produce, and people and animals are uniformly organized into mutual aid teams, uniformly harvesting, transporting, and planting. The enemy often comes out in the morning, the militia guards in front of the village, and the masses work behind the village; in the afternoon, the enemies all go back, and the masses turn to the front of the village.

Secondly, we changed the subjective and formalistic method of dividing joint defenses. The masses of each village naturally demand mutual support and exchange of information in the struggle against the enemy, and they will naturally form the joint defense they need. In the past, we divided joint defenses by work base points, some of which were not suitable for the needs of the struggle, and thus became nominal. In particular, the junction of joint defenses and the junction of districts were often taken advantage of by the enemy because of lack of contact. The Dahai Township in the Eighth District borders the two villages of 圪堆坡 in the Seventh District. 圪堆坡 requires Dahai Township to send him intelligence to prevent the enemy from launching a sneak attack from the Yuhe River to the Bobi direction; Dahai Township also requires 圪堆坡 to send him intelligence to prevent the enemy from launching a sneak attack from the Zhaogu and Miaogang directions, so a joint defense is naturally formed. According to the needs of the masses, we broke the boundaries between districts and districts, joint defenses and joint defenses, and adopted this new division method. The junction is no longer being attacked. At the same time, the tasks of the joint defense are also clearly stipulated, that is, to exchange information and support each other, instead of replacing the struggle of each village.

The district cadre队 is also a natural requirement after the development of the struggle in each village. Once there is a favorable opportunity to歼 destroy the enemy, the masses immediately think of moving troops from the district. Based on this requirement, we organized a small and精干 district cadre队 of three or twenty people in each district. The militia in the孟 Village area repelled the large-scale incursions of about a hundred enemy troops twice in October, which was due to the support of the district cadre队, otherwise it may have suffered losses. But for the district cadre队 to play a role, it must also have the foundation of the struggle in each village. Otherwise, it will form the naked dance of some district cadre队 in the past.

This time, the district headquarters adopted the method of relying on a joint defense and relying on an important village, changing the past practice of being isolated in the rear and often requiring many people to protect the messengers. Its commanding role has also been strengthened.

Another important experience is that this time we studied and corrected the past passive view and practice of simply "preserving strength." In the past, we said: "Preserving cadres, activists, and militia is an achievement." So when the enemy came, we withdrew to the top of the mountain to train and communicate ideas; as a result, because we were divorced from the struggle, we could not see our own strength, and our thinking was always not clear. This time we adopted the policy of "persisting in not going up the mountain and living and dying with the people under the mountain," that is, even when the enemy pursued us several times with a battalion or more of troops, we only retreated to the foot of the mountain. We dug trenches in the higher ground at the foot of the mountain and hid to fire排枪. The enemy had to be forced to stop advancing and bombard with artillery. But when the militia shouted fearlessly, "Two more炮," the enemy thought that we had regular troops and quickly retreated. The masses therefore changed their saying that "the militia cannot be relied on, and the government cannot be relied on." When the enemy attacked盘上 at the end of October, the cadres and militia in the Chengguan District not only did not retreat, but also advanced to Jiushengying, ten miles away from the city. Later, the enemy went back and publicized that "the Eighth Route Army was annihilated," and the masses all made faces and did not believe it at all. Our prestige has been greatly improved. The Bobi area has also victoriously persisted in the struggle as usual.

The last experience is to go deep into the enemy's lair and launch a revenge movement. The Jiang伪保长 of Wufangying诱 killed two of our militia. We held a memorial service and encouraged revenge. The militia in the village sneaked into the enemy's stronghold at night, killed the 保长, and shouted, "We are here to avenge ×××!" This gave the pseudo-personnel great镇压. The militia of Zhangzaitun also raided the enemy at night under the slogan of revenge and夺回 five livestock that were劫 (the person to be killed was not found).

Because we persisted in the struggle in this way, the fighting spirit of the militia and masses in Huixian County has become increasingly firm. They said: "We persisted for a winter last year, and it will not be a problem to persist until next summer this year." (Dong)

    【本报特讯】辉县群众游击战争的开展，最近受到太行三分区的表扬。为明了某领导经验，记者特于八日晚走访新近来到武安的辉县副县长刘西瑞同志，承解答如下：
    十月中旬，蒋军于进攻焦作的同时侵入我辉的薄璧区后，群众游击战争能够很快开展起来，坚持了薄璧一带三十来村的全部阵地，不断打击消耗敌人，取得多次胜利，这是由于我们改正了去年秋末以来游击战争领导上若干错误，解决了一些重要问题。首先，最主要的是解决了游击战争的内容问题，解决了“为谁打”与“谁来打”的问题。以前我们也常说游击战应该是群众性的，保卫群众利益的；但做起来却相反：我们存在着不相信群众、不相信民兵、不放手让大家起来自己保卫自己，而由领导上包办的错误思想作风。敌人一进攻，我们把各村民兵都集合到联防或区指挥部，自己领着干、把着干；生怕民兵不坚定，觉得各村在各村干部会出乱子。但集中的结果，是各村群众没有了武装骨干，一听枪响，一看见几个敌人就哄跑，白天不能生产，晚间不敢在家睡觉。民兵队由于找不到群众，情报搞不好，不能主动打敌人。白天盲目地到前面“游击”，只能走几个村，敌之武装特务仍可在好多村庄进出，群众恨他们入骨，但又无可奈何。晚间民兵队退回后面宿营，目标很大，极易被敌侦知，时常有受奔袭危险。岗哨警戒，疲劳不堪，陷于自顾不暇。其根本原因，即是把游击战变成了领导机关、干部与民兵队的事，骨干脱离了群众，群众没有了骨干，游击战实际上与群众要求、群众利益脱节。十月敌进攻之初，也曾有七八天陷于这种情况，重复了历史教训。但这次比较及时的研究了这些教训，坚决把各村民兵分散到各村，结合群众，坚持阵地。同时明确确定各村民兵的主要任务是打击各该村的还乡队武装奸霸地主与特务，方法是放手让群众自己打。我们引导民兵讨论，明确了“我们比奸霸地主人多枪多又能打”，坚定了必胜信念。分散之后，民兵在群众中起了作用，首先是情报工作大大加强了。九区柳湾、老磨庄等地民兵不仅摸清了敌之行动规律，甚至摸清了每个还乡队地主带的什么枪，什么子弹，好使不好使。十月底活捉张天德，并打死其他四个还乡队奸霸地主的胜利伏击，即是这一分散的直接结果。一般村庄，由于民兵与群众的结合，也都觉得“眼亮”了；责任心、积极性与创造性得到发扬，“唯武器”论得到克服，以前非机关枪不能打仗，现在则地雷石雷都被运用起来。小股敌人到处受到打击，不敢妄动，还乡地主与武装特务再不敢随便进村了，局面很快稳住了。
    与此直接关联的，我们大大加强了村指挥部的作用。根据几年体验，村指挥部是领导游击战的根本环节，而过去恰怡忽视了它。民兵一大集中，村指挥部实际上成了空指挥部，只好跟群众哄跑，或跟民兵去集中，丢弃了群众。这次我们把村指挥部变成了指挥民兵作战，侦察情报，指挥群众备战与转移的真正指挥部。这三部分工作都由专人负责，并有一定组织与任务，便很快搞起来了。显著的成绩是胜利完成了收稻、种麦与藏粮三大任务（敌进攻时，这些都还没做）。一般村庄，都是民兵放着哨，干部领着群众生产，人和牲口统一编成变工大队，统一收割、运送与下种。上午敌人常出来，民兵在村前放哨，群众在村后干；午后敌人都回去了，群众便转到村前。
    再其次，是改变了主观主义、形式主义地划分联防的作法。各村群众在对敌斗争中自然地要求互相支援、互通情报，也就会自然地形成他们所需要的联防。过去我们以工作基点为单位划分联防，有些并不适合斗争需要，也就形成有名无实。特别是联防与联防、区与区的结合部，时常因没有联系而为敌所乘。八区的大海乡与七区的圪堆坡二村接壤。圪堆坡为防止敌人由峪河转薄璧方向来偷袭，要求大海乡给他送情报；大海乡为防止敌人由赵固、庙岗方向来偷袭，也要求圪堆坡给他送情报，这样就自然形成联防。我们根据群众要求，打破了区与区、联防与联防的界线，采取了这种新划法，结合部已不再被偷袭。同时，关于联防的任务也做了明确规定，这就是互通情报与支援，而不是代替各村斗争。
    区干队，也是各村斗争开展后的自然要求。一有有利的歼敌机会，群众即想到区里搬兵。依据这种要求，我们在各区组织三、二十人的短小精干的区干队。孟村一带民兵十月份曾两次击退敌百人左右的大股出犯，即因有区干队的支援，否则是可能吃亏的。但区干队要起作用，也必须有各村斗争开展作基础。否则，即会形成过去某些区干队的裸体跳舞。
    区指挥部，这次采取了依托一个联防，依托一个重要村庄的办法，改变了过去孤立于后方，还经常要好些人保护送信的做法，它的指挥作用也加强了。
    另一重要经验，是这次我们研究与纠正了过去单纯“保存力量”的消极观点与做法。过去我们说：“保存下干部积极分子和民兵就是成绩”，于是敌人一来就撤到山顶上去训练，打通思想；结果因脱离了斗争，看不见自己力量，思想就老打不通。这次我们采取了“坚持不上山与山下人民共存亡”的方针，即在敌以一营以上兵力数次向我追击时，也只退到山根。我们在山根较高处挖壕隐蔽起来打排枪，敌人不得不被迫停止前进，而用炮轰。但当民兵毫不畏惧地喊着“再来两炮”时，敌人却以为我有正规军，赶快退走了。群众因此改变“民兵靠不上、政府靠不上”的说法。十月底敌人进攻盘上时，城关区干部民兵不仅不退，并挺进到离城十里的九圣营活动，后来敌人回去宣传说：“八路军消灭了”，群众都歪鼻子努嘴，完全不信。我之威信大大提高。薄璧一带，也都胜利的照常坚持了斗争。
    最后一个经验是深入虎穴，开展复仇运动。五放营蒋伪保长诱杀了我们两个民兵，我们开了追悼大会，鼓动复仇。该村民兵在夜里潜入敌据点，把该保长打死，并高喊“我们是为×××来报仇的！”这给伪人员以极大镇压。张寨屯的民兵，也在复仇口号下夜袭敌人，夺回被劫牲口五头（要杀的对象没找到）。
    由于我们这样坚持了斗争，辉县民兵群众的斗志日益坚固。他们说：“去年坚持了一冬天，今年坚持到明年夏天也不成问题。”（东）
