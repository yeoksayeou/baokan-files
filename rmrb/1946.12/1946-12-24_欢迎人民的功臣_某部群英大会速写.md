　　Welcome to the People's Heroes
    A Sketch of a Hero Congress of a Certain Unit
    At dawn on the 15th, four of the latest "Jemse" cars drove to various units to pick up the heroes. The sound of the propellers turning stirred up the whole village. On the carriages, there were four large red characters that said "Hero Train", and on the glass in front of the driver, there was a neat yellow horizontal plaque with the red characters "Welcome Heroes" written on it, surrounded by several red stars. The flag on the front of the car fluttered in the cold winter morning wind. The cars, full of heroes, returned, "Attention!" - the troops lined up to pay their respects to their heroes. The crowd surged towards the village entrance like a tide, surrounding the heroes' train. Gongs and drums resounded, and the majestic sounds of wind instruments and horns, accompanied by majestic songs, poured out the people's respect for the heroes. The heroes jumped out of the cars one by one, their faces showing infinite excitement and joy. As the heroes walked towards the registration desk, the welcoming crowd raised their arms and shouted in unison: "Welcome heroic models!" "Heroes are the people's meritorious servants!" "We ordinary people only exist because of heroes!" The heroes were symbols of victory. Some wore the US military uniforms captured in the Dingtao campaign, wore Japanese steel helmets, and carried "Zhongzheng" rifles. Others carried US-made submachine guns and US-made small cannons obtained from Chiang Kai-shek's direct line 11th Division in the Longfeng campaign... Almost all of Chiang Kai-shek's US equipment could be found on the heroes. At the heroes' banquet, Commissioner Qin paid tribute to the heroes on behalf of two million people, and representatives from nearby villages also came to toast the heroes. The people's meritorious officials raised their glasses and drank heartily, encouraging each other: "Now that we sit in the heroes' seats, we must do heroes' deeds. We must fight even better in the next battle." The venue was filled with heroic spirit.

　　欢迎人民的功臣
    某部群英大会速写
    十五日天一亮，四辆最新式的“杰姆生”汽车，开到各单位去接英雄。螺旋桨转动的声音，把全村的人都轰动出来了。车厢上，贴着“英雄列车”四个大红字，司机前面的玻璃上，是一幅标致的黄纸的横额，上写着：“欢迎英雄”几个红字。周围有几颗红星点缀着。车头上的旗迎着冬晨的寒风在飘舞。满载英雄的汽车回来了，“立正！”——部队列队向自己的英雄们致敬。人群像潮水似的向村口涌去，围绕着英雄们列车。锣鼓喧天、笙管悠扬，雄壮的军号伴和着雄壮的歌声倾壮出人民对英雄的敬意。英雄们一个个跳下汽车，脸上现出了无限兴奋与快乐。英雄们向报到处走去，欢迎的人群高举起了手臂，齐声欢呼：“欢迎英雄模范！”“英雄是人民的功臣！”“有了英雄才有我们老百姓！”英雄们是胜利的象征，有的穿着定陶战役中缴获的美装军服，戴着日本钢盔，提着“中正式”步枪，有的背着龙凤战役中得自蒋介石嫡系十一师的美式冲锋枪、美式小炮……。蒋介石所有的美式装备，差不多在英雄们的身上都可以找到。在英雄的宴会上，秦专员代表二百万人民向英雄致敬，附近村庄的老百姓也派代表来为英雄敬酒。人民的功臣们举杯痛饮，互相勉励着说：“坐的英雄席，要干英雄事，下次打仗一定要打得更漂亮。”会场上洋溢着一片英雄气概。
