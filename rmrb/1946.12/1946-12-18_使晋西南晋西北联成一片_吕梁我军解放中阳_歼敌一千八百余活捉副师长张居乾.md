Xinhua News Agency, Lüliang Front, 15th – Following the recapture of five counties in western Shanxi – Xixian, Puxian, Yonghe, etc. – last month, the Lüliang Eighth Route Army liberated Zhongyang County on the 12th of this month. This marks the sixth county town liberated by the Eighth Route Army in the western Shanxi area. In this battle, over 1,600 Yan troops, including Yan army's 45th Division Deputy Commander Zhang Juqian, were captured alive, over 200 were killed or wounded, and two mountain guns, four mortars, 84 light and heavy machine guns, over 800 rifles, and over 20 grenade launchers were seized. Zhongyang City was an important stronghold of the Yan army. Since the ceasefire order this January, the Yan army in the area has constantly invaded our Lüliang Liberated Area. At the end of June this year, they once infiltrated near the Lishi County seat in the Liberated Area but were repelled. The Eighth Route Army in the area launched a counter-offensive for self-defense on the evening of the 11th of this month, and the city was captured by the morning of the 12th after fierce fighting. The Eighth Route Army entered the city amidst the cheers of the people. The liberation of this city has linked the two major liberated areas of southwestern and northwestern Shanxi into one.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 15th – Xixian, Daning, and other places in southwestern Shanxi are rapidly undergoing restoration, and residents are returning to their homes one after another. The Daning market opened on the 27th of last month with the sound of gongs and drums. Xixian is a distribution center for goods in southwestern Shanxi, originally with more than 300 shops, which were later brought to a standstill due to Yan Xishan's commercial rule. Large-scale grain stores and workshops for oil and flour, etc., were all monopolized by Yan's "Commercial Federation," and the taxes were heavy and complicated. From June to November this year alone, more than 20 million yuan was collected in taxes. Now they are all resuming operations. The democratic government is organizing old peddlers to transport goods to the old liberated areas and distributing relief grain. In Daning and Xixian alone, 600,000 jin has been distributed, with each person receiving several dou. Cao Changze, an old scholar in his late seventies, said when receiving food: "In my life, this is the first time I have seen such a government that loves the people like its own children." After the efforts of Mr. Liu Xiyi and Mr. Li Kewen, who have been engaged in education for many years, the Xixian Middle School Junior Teachers' College and the Central Primary School opened on the 6th.

　　使晋西南晋西北联成一片
    吕梁我军解放中阳       
    歼敌一千八百余活捉副师长张居乾
    【新华社吕梁前线十五日电】吕梁八路军继上月收复晋西隰县、蒲县、永和等五座县城后，又于本月十二日解放中阳县城，这是八路军于晋西地区解放之第六座县城。此役生俘阎军四十五师副师长张居乾以下一千六百余人，毙伤二百余人，缴获山炮两门，迫击炮四门，轻重机枪八十四挺，步枪八百余支，掷弹筒二十余个。按中阳城为阎军重要据点，自今年一月停战令后，该地阎军即不断向我吕梁解放区进犯。今年六月底，曾一度窜犯至解放区离石县城附近，后被击退。该地八路军乃于本月十一日晚发动自卫反击，激战至十二日晨，该城即被攻克。八路军于人民欢迎声中进入该城。此次该城解放，已使晋西南与晋西北两大解放区联成一片。
    【新华社晋绥十五日电】晋西南隰县、大宁等地正迅速进行恢复，居民纷纷回返家园。大宁集市于上月二十七日在锣鼓喧天中开幕。隰县为晋西南货物集散地，原有商号三百余家，后因阎锡山商业统治而陷于停顿。规模较大之粮店及油粉等作坊，皆由阎之“商联社”垄断，且苛杂繁重，仅今年六月至十一月即征税二千万元以上，现皆复业。民主政府组织旧贩向老解放区贩运货物，发放救济粮，仅在大宁隰县两地即发六十万斤，每人可得数斗。年近七旬之老秀才曹长泽在领得食粮时说：“我有生以来第一次看见这样爱民如子的政府。”隰县中学简师及中心小学经从事教育多年之刘锡毅、李克文两先生努力，已于六日开学。
