[From Our Newspaper in Weixian, 7th] Our newspaper reporter reported on the new atmosphere in Shengfotang Village, Weixian County, after land reform, stating: 1. Labor is glorious. Both men and women are engaged in production, and not a single idle person can be found even in winter. 2. Everyone has land, houses, food, and clothing. 3. No thieves, bandits, idlers, hooligans, or opium addicts can be found. All sixteen landlord households have also joined the labor force, living a life of plenty and warmth. Since entering winter, they have put down their farm tools and started sideline production. In the past, landlord Geng Quande monopolized more than 50 mu of land and had a family of six (including three children); this year, he harvested 360 jin of sorghum, 810 jin of millet, 200 jin of white beans, 450 jin of water caltrop, 900 jin of cotton, and 1,000 jin of sweet potatoes. Calculating at two jin of grain per person per day, this is enough to eat for two and a half years. He joined the cotton ginning group and gins until midnight every day. The entire group has already earned 2,000 jin of cottonseed. Shen Wenniang, who previously owned more than 300 mu of land, has young children in school, so she hired a farmhand and now cultivates more than 50 mu of land herself, personally doing the cooking, feeding the cattle, and picking cotton; she has also learned a lot about farming knowledge by going to the fields for harvesting and grinding. This year, she harvested more than 2,000 jin of coarse grains, 600 jin of cotton, and more than 1,000 jin of wheat, which is also enough for two years. The landlord "Four-Eyed Blind Man," who previously didn't know the five grains apart, used to only smoke opium; now he has joined a mutual aid group, exchanging labor for oxen. He grinds flour and sells steamed buns day and night, using the money he earns to buy a new donkey and a new millstone, preparing to have his children learn to grind flour. The other thirteen landlord households are also working hard with their own hands, engaging in labor, and have successively started sideline businesses, enjoying a life of plenty and happiness.

　　圣佛堂十六家地主亲自劳动衣食饱暖
    【本报威县七日电】本报记者报导土地改革后威县圣佛堂村的新气象称：一、劳动光荣，男女都生产，冬天也找不到一个闲人。二、人人有地、有房、有吃、有穿。三、找不到一个小偷、土匪、懒汉、流氓、吸买白面犯，十六户地主也都参加了劳动，过着饱暖的日子。入冬来，他们丢下农具，已开始副业生产。旧日地主耿全德独占五十多亩地，六口人（三个小孩）；今年收高粱三百六十斤，谷子八百一十斤，白豆二百斤，玉菱四百五十斤，棉花九百斤，红薯一千斤，按每人每天二斤粮计，能吃二年半。他参加了轧花组，每天轧到半夜，全组已赚了两千斤花籽。早先有三顷多地的申文娘，儿小上学，觅了一个长工，现种五十余亩地，自己亲自操作；做饭、喂牛、摘花；下地收割、磨碾，也学了好些庄稼知识，今年收两千余斤粗粮，六百斤棉花，一千余斤麦，也够二年用。以前五谷不分的地主四瞎子光吸白面；现在加入互助组，凭着牛换人工，自己昼夜推磨、卖馍馍、＠子，用赚的钱新买一头驴、一盘新磨，准备让孩子学磨粉。其他十三户地主也都挥动双手，从事劳作，并先后干起副业来，享受着饱暖愉快的生活。
