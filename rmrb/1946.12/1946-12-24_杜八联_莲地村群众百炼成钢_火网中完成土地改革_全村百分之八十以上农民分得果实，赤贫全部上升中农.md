　　“Du Ba Lian” of Lian Di Village: Masses Tempered into Steel
    Land Reform Completed in a Hail of Bullets
    Over 80% of Villagers Receive Fruits of Labor; All Impoverished Rise to Middle Peasant Status
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 22nd dispatch] The masses of Lian Di Village, one of the "Du Ba Lian" in Jiyuan, carried out a total reckoning with feudal forces in the midst of artillery fire and completed land reform. Like the brother villages of other "Du Ba Lian," the masses of Lian Di Village have been tempered into steel in armed struggle, and are currently carrying out a total reckoning with feudal forces in a hail of bullets. The village has a total of 114 households, including three landlords, seven feudal rich peasants, 48 middle peasants, 46 poor peasants, and ten impoverished households. There were as many as 208 cases of tenancy debts between peasants and landlords and feudal rich peasants, as well as cases of local tyrants and bullies. All the peasants united and, under the slogan of "If the big tree falls, everyone has firewood to burn," finally brought down the local tyrants and bullies and recovered the fruits of struggle: 192 mu of land, six head of livestock, six houses, and grain, farm tools, etc. The distribution method was based on the principle of "distributing what is lacking." Some activists were rewarded. As a result, over 80% of the villagers received the fruits of their labor. The class relations in the village have changed. The original three landlord households have been reduced to middle peasants, 48 middle peasant households, 13 have risen to prosperous middle peasants, and the rest remain unchanged. Among the 46 poor peasant households, 41 have risen to middle peasants, one has risen to a prosperous middle peasant, and all ten impoverished households have risen to middle peasants. This method of total reckoning and distributing the fruits according to the situation has been supported by 90% of the villagers.

    【本报太岳二十二日电】济源“杜八联”之一的莲地村群众，在炮火中对封建势力实行总清算，完成土地改革。莲地村与其他“杜八联”的兄弟村庄一样，群众在武装斗争中百炼成钢，目前又在火网中对封建势力进行总清算。该村共一百一十四户，尚有地主三户，封建富农七户，及中农四十八户，贫农四十六户，赤贫十户，农民与地主封建富农的租佃债务关系，及奸霸案件，尚有二百零八件之多，全体农民团结起来，在“砍倒大树大家有柴烧”的口号下，终将奸霸地主斗倒，收回斗争果实土地一百九十二亩，牲口六头，房子六座，及粮食农具等。其分配办法，是按缺什分什的原则进行的，对部分积极分子予以奖励，因此全村百分之八十以上农民得到果实，现该村阶级关系已起变化，原三户地主下降为中农，四十八户中农，十三户上升为富裕中农，余皆未变，四十六户贫农中，四十一户上升为中农，一户上升为富裕中农，十户赤贫均上升为中农。此种总清算按情况分配果实办法，得到全村百分之九十农民的拥护。
