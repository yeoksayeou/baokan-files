　　The Man with the "Six-Shooter Box"
    ——Taiyue Communication

    Here—in the Fourth District of Jiexiu, everyone knows there is a man with a "six-shooter box." He relies on this "six-shooter box" to move in and out of the strongholds crowded with the forces of Yan Xishan and the puppet regime, and countless miraculous stories about him circulate widely among the masses. This is Luo Laifu, a young farmer and son of the soil who grew up in this land.

    He experienced the suffering of the older generation, coupled with the endless looting and beatings by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, he could no longer bear it. He thought of going elsewhere, but for a farmer, leaving his homeland is like losing his reliance, so he began a life of struggle to defend the land. He used his own wisdom to transform a broken gun into what he called the "six-shooter box," and often went in and out of the strongholds of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan to strike at the enemy. He is in Jingsheng Village today, and in Yilu Village tomorrow. Wherever he goes, the masses welcome the man with the "six-shooter box."

    In October, someone came to Luo Laifu to complain that Chiang's 77th Division had robbed him of five *shi* of grain and a head of livestock, and another person came to complain that Chiang's army had robbed him of cotton clothes, cotton quilts, and several pairs of tattered socks. This farmer was so angry that he jumped up and down, cursing these bandits. He firmly said: "I will definitely avenge you." Sure enough, on the 23rd, he and two partners ambushed the road at the bottom of the river. When two plainclothes enemies from Qinshu Village walked up, Luo Laifu jumped out unexpectedly and asked: "Which unit are you from?" The two plainclothes men answered in a panic: "The 217th Regiment of the 77th Division." Luo Laifu knew that these two had no weapons, so he continued to ask: "Do you have any belongings?" They panicked even more and said: "No, no..." Luo Laifu suddenly jumped over and grabbed them, and at this time, the two partners who were lying in ambush also came out to help. One plainclothes man took out 70,000 yuan to buy his life, but Luo Laifu waved the "six-shooter box" in front of them and said: "We haven't settled accounts with you yet." The second time, on November 9th, a battalion of enemies from Jingsheng went to Changshou to rob grain. Someone told Luo Laifu, and he took his "six-shooter box" and set off with two partners. Luo Laifu stuffed the "six-shooter box" under his clothes, still looking like a farmer. As soon as he walked into Changshou Village, he ran into a plainclothes man. Luo Laifu pretended to be one of his own and asked: "Has the team left?" The man replied: "They have all left." Luo Laifu thought that these bandits had gotten away with it this time, but an idea came to him: "I have to take care of this guy." At this time, that person also asked Luo Laifu: "Which unit are you from?" Luo Laifu answered without hesitation: "The 73rd Division, what about you?" He answered: "The 217th Regiment." Luo Laifu expressed disbelief, and the man took out a plainclothes certificate from his pocket. His name was Li Mingjie. Luo Laifu said: "Okay, you are familiar with this place, go and capture the militia." The plainclothes man excitedly said: "Right!" The plainclothes man led the way, and when they walked out of the gate, Luo Laifu waved his "six-shooter box," and two partners came out and tied up the plainclothes man Li Mingjie. Li Mingjie said in surprise: "We are on the same side!" Luo Laifu cursed: "You are a good-for-nothing member of our side." From then on, the plainclothes men of Chiang and Yan were all in a panic, and even the 73rd Division dared not come out easily, so Luo Laifu's "business" was also greatly reduced. Until the 12th, when he heard that two regiments of the 73rd Division were going to Dazhan for a change of defense, Luo Laifu laughed happily and said: "This is when business comes!" He disguised himself as someone else's plainclothes man and waited at Jiajiabao. After a while, two real plainclothes men walked towards him. Luo Laifu went over and asked: "Which unit are you from?" The plainclothes man answered nonchalantly: "From the 45th Division." They asked Luo Laifu, who said he was from the 73rd Division, and asked them if they had any evidence? Did they have any weapons? The other party said: "Yes, yes." They took out a pistol and two grenades. Luo Laifu followed closely and said: "Put them down, let me check." Then he took out his "six-shooter box" and ordered the other party to put down their weapons. The two plainclothes men surrendered their weapons and, seeing that the situation was not right, turned around and fled. Luo Laifu chased them for a long time. Luo Laifu got a pistol, two grenades, and a coat. The man with the "six-shooter box" is still moving in and out of the strongholds of Chiang and Yan. Now, young people in the areas occupied by Chiang and Yan are all saying: We must learn from the "six-shooter box," and a large number of young people are joining the armed struggle to protect the land.

### 带“六把盒子”的人——太岳通讯

　　带“六把盒子”的人
    ——太岳通讯
    这里——介休四区，谁也知道有个带“六把盒子”的人，他依靠这支“六把盒子”出没在阎伪林立的据点里，说不完的神出鬼没的故事，在群众中广泛地流传着。这就是从这个土地生长起来的子弟兵——年青的庄稼人罗来福。
    他遭遇过过去老一代的痛苦，加上蒋阎无穷无尽的掳掠鞭打，他再也忍受不下去了，他想到别的地方去，可是庄稼人离开乡土，就像失掉了依靠一样，因此他开始了保卫土地斗争的生活。他运用自己的智慧，把一支破枪改造过来，叫做“六把盒子”，经常出入在蒋阎的据点里打击敌人。他今天在静升村，明天在移戮村。他到那里，那里的群众欢迎这个带“六把盒子”的人。
    十月间，有人来向罗来福哭诉蒋七十七师抢走他五石粮食、一头牲口，又有人来哭诉蒋军抢走棉衣、棉被和几双破烂的袜子的事，这个庄稼人气得暴跳起来，咒骂着这些土匪。他坚决的说：“我一定要给你报仇。”果然，二十三日和两个伙伴埋伏在河底的道上，待秦树村敌人两个便衣走到跟前，罗来福出其不意地跳出来，问道：“那一部分？”两个便衣慌慌张张回答：“七十七师二一七团的。”罗来福心里明白这两个没有家伙，就接着问：“有家具没有”？他们更慌张说：“没，没，……”罗来福一下子跳过去扭住他们，这时埋伏着的两个伙伴也出来帮忙，一个便衣掏出七万块钱来买命，罗来福把“六把盒子”在他们面前一幌，说：“和你们的账算不清呢。”第二次，十一月九日静升敌人一个营，到长寿去抢粮，不知谁告诉了罗来福，他又带上“六把盒子”，跟两个伙伴一起出发了。罗来福把“六把盒子”塞在衣服底下，仍是一个庄稼人样。刚走进长寿村就碰上个便衣，罗来福装着自己人似的问：“队伍走了？”这人答道：“都走了。”罗来福心想这次便宜了这些土匪，但又计上心来：“得把这个家伙收拾了。”这时那个人也问起罗来福来了：“你是那部分”？罗来福毫不迟疑地答道：“七十三师的，你呢？”他答：“二一七团的。”罗来福表示不信，这人从口袋里拿出一个便衣证来，他叫李明杰。罗来福说：“好，这里你熟悉，去捉民兵。”便衣兴奋地说：“对！”便衣在前带路，走出大门，罗来福的“六把盒子”一摆，两个伙伴出来把便衣李明杰捆起来。李明杰惊奇地说：“自己人！”罗来福骂道：“有你这个没出息的自己人”。自此以后，蒋阎军便衣都恐慌起来了，连七十三师也不敢轻易出来，罗来福的“买卖”也减少了许多。直到十二日，听到七十三师有两个团要往大斩换防，罗来福高兴地笑起来说：“这可是买卖到了！”他又装扮成人家的便衣，在佳家堡等着，不多一会，有两个真便衣往这边走，罗来福过去问：“那一部分？”便衣不介意地回答：“是四十五师的。”他们问罗来福，罗说是七十三师的，问他们带证据没有？带家具没有？对方说：“有，有。”就拿出一支手枪，两个手榴弹，罗来福紧跟着说：“放下，待我检查。”便掏出他那把“六把盒子”，命令对方放下武器。两个便衣缴了械，看风势不对，回头就逃，罗来福一直追了很远。罗来福得了一支手枪，两个手榴弹和一件大衣。带“六把盒子”的人，现在还出没在蒋阎据点里。现在蒋阎军占领区里的年青人，都说：可得好好学习人家“六把盒子”，大批青年卷进武装保土斗争中。（新华社太岳分社）
