Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Shanghai News: Following closely on the heels of the incident in which Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, was forced to leave for Hong Kong and was stabbed by Kuomintang secret agents, the Labor Association was forcibly reorganized by the Chiang government on the 8th of this month, with An Zhuting as Chairman. The leadership institutions have been completely usurped by Kuomintang reactionaries. Local newspapers have recently exposed the Chiang government's oppression and destruction of the Labor Association over the past year, stating that the Kuomintang authorities' destruction of the Labor Association began with the Jiaochangkou incident in February of this year. On January 30th, the closing day of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), the Labor Association put forward twenty-three political demands, calling for democracy and supporting the PCC. This deeply angered Chiang Kai-shek and his gang. On February 10th, at the PCC success celebration meeting in Jiaochangkou, the Labor Association's contingent was besieged and beaten by secret agents and thugs dispatched by the Kuomintang authorities. After this, a series of blows followed one after another. All the way until August 6th, the Chongqing "Federation of Trade Unions," under the auspices of the Kuomintang authorities and with the "legal" protection of armed police, forcibly "took over" five institutions of the Labor Association in Chongqing, including the Labor Hospital and Welfare Society, and arrested thirty-eight Labor Association staff members. Later, due to the fierce opposition of the people throughout the country and the intervention of the United States (because the Labor Association had connections with the two major American labor unions, and the Labor Association's welfare funds were donated by these two unions), in mid-September, Chiang Kai-shek finally agreed to Zhu Xuefan's request to release the arrested personnel and return the institutions. However, the conditions were: (1) The Labor Association must issue an anti-Communist declaration; (2) Trade unions in the Liberated Areas must withdraw from the Labor Association; (3) The Labor Association must be thoroughly reorganized; (4) A three-five committee should be established in Chongqing, with five members from the Labor Association, five from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and five from the local Social Bureau and Municipal Party Headquarters Youth League to jointly participate in management. Mr. Zhu naturally could not accept this, so it became a stalemate again. At the same time, the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, under the instruction of the authorities, falsely accused the Labor Association in court of "endangering public security and plotting internal rebellion" and other trumped-up charges to exert new pressure on the Labor Association. The matter dragged on until the beginning of November, when Chiang Kai-shek wanted to force Mr. Zhu to participate in the one-party "National Assembly," which Zhu firmly refused. The Chiang government then attempted to frame and arrest Zhu. Mr. Zhu still left Shanghai for Hong Kong on November 12th; on the 16th, he issued an English statement in Hong Kong, denouncing the Chiang government's anti-democratic measures and its one-party "National Assembly." On the 25th, Mr. Zhu was secretly attacked and injured by Chiang's agents. After Mr. Zhu's departure, the Kuomintang authorities issued a declaration in the name of the Labor Association supporting the one-party "National Assembly" and actively planned to forcibly reorganize the Labor Association.

　　蒋政府强迫改组劳协
    领导机构全为国民党反动分子篡夺
    沪报揭露蒋政府压迫摧残劳协经过
    【新华社延安廿一日电】沪讯：紧接中国劳动协会理事长朱学范氏被逼出走在港遭国民党特务刺伤事件后，劳协已于本月八日被蒋政府强迫实行改组，以安竹庭为理事长，领导机构完全为国民党反动分子所篡夺。此间报纸顷揭露蒋政府一年来压迫摧残劳协经过称：国民党当局对于劳协的摧残，开始于今年二月较场口事件。一月三十日政协闭幕日，劳协曾提出二十三条政治主张，要求民主，拥护政协。这深深触怒了蒋介石及其一伙人，二月十日较场口政协成功庆祝会中，劳协队伍受到国民党当局所派遣之特务暴徒的围攻殴打。此后一连串的打击接踵而来。一直到八月六日，国民党当局主持下之重庆“总工会”在武装警察“合法”保障下，实行武力“接收”劳协在重庆的劳工医院福利社等五机构，并捕去劳协职员三十八人。后因全国人民的激烈反对及美国方面之干涉（因劳协与美国两大工会有联系，劳协福利经费即该两工会所捐），九月中旬蒋介石始面允朱学范释放被捕人员，发还机构。但条件是：（１）劳协须发表反共宣言；（２）解放区工会退出劳协；（３）彻底改组劳协；（４）重庆组三五委员会，由劳协五人、市总工会五人、当地社会局市党部青年团五人共同参加管理。朱氏当然不能接受，所以又成僵局。同时，重庆市总工会又在当局授意下向法院诬告劳协“妨害治安阴谋内乱”等莫须有的罪名，以施新压力于劳协。事情拖到十一月初，蒋介石欲强令朱氏参加一党“国大”，朱坚予拒绝，蒋政府随企图对朱加以陷害和逮捕，朱氏仍于十一月十二日离沪赴港；十六日在港发表一英文声明，痛斥蒋政府反民主措施及其一党“国大”。二十五日，朱氏即遭蒋特暗害受伤。国民党当局在朱氏出走后，即假劳协名义发表拥护一党“国大”宣言，并积极筹划强迫改组劳协。
