　　Comparison Meetings and General Inspection
　　In order to truly distribute the fruits of labor fairly and reasonably, after the grades have been determined and the specific distribution method has been studied on a household basis, the masses should be mobilized to conduct an inspection. This is the comparison meeting.
　　After the grade and specific distribution method for each household are assessed, there are generally two methods of publicizing: either posting a draft list of fruit distribution by village, or convening a general meeting to announce it. The former method is more troublesome and time-consuming, but its advantage is that it is convenient for the masses to inspect. Because at a general meeting, there are too many people, it is not easy to hear clearly, and the masses can only remember the grades and amounts received by a few acquaintances. In this way, the comparison will not be as thorough and detailed. Therefore, if there is no great difficulty, it is best to post a draft list.
　　After the draft list of fruit distribution is announced, a general meeting should be held to mobilize everyone to raise opinions and compare with each other. At this time, the leadership should focus on putting forward slogans such as "Speak up if you have something to say; it is democratic for anyone to raise opinions," "Don't feel embarrassed to say if you are not satisfied; it will be too late to talk about it after the accounts are settled and the land is divided," "Comparison is for fairness, not selfishness," and "Better a frank villain than a hypocritical gentleman" to enlighten the masses, break down everyone's concerns about saving face, and stimulate everyone to raise more opinions. In order to allow the masses to reminisce, turn their thoughts around, and carefully compare with others, one or two days should be set aside for individual deliberation, family research, and group discussions.
　　Whether the comparison meeting can be held well depends entirely on the quality of the masses' deliberation. Therefore, it is necessary to create a wave of mutual comparison in the village, mobilize all members of the masses, everyone to deliberate, everyone to argue, mutually inquire about grades, compare levels; and hold family meetings on a household basis, with the whole family discussing together. When Da Wu Willow Grove held family meetings, even children (Young Pioneer members) and young women (Sister Group members) participated in the debate, asking their parents questions such as "What grade are we? What grade are they?" "Why are we lower than others?" "How is the land we got?" creating an atmosphere where everyone was talking about it on the streets and in the alleys. After the individual deliberation is almost complete, each organization should hold a group meeting, where everyone puts forward their opinions. After the preliminary research by the group, they prepare the opinions to be presented to the general meeting.
　　When the deliberation is mature, a village-wide mutual comparison meeting is convened to start a heated discussion and debate. Then, all the opinions are collected and first jointly discussed by the struggle fruit distribution committee to decide how to deal with them. Then it is announced at the general meeting for the masses to vote on and approve. Finally, the grade and distribution amount of each person is determined and an official list is published.
　　After such a serious inspection, distributing according to the grades, amounts and things finally agreed upon by everyone can completely achieve fairness and reasonableness. At the same time, in the mutual comparison, the masses, starting from their own interests, put forward debates. After everyone's repeated comparison, discussion, and deliberation, they will gradually see everyone's interests. Thus, the masses will improve a step further. Otherwise, no matter how fair the district and village cadres are, even if there is not a single mistake, the masses will inevitably be somewhat dissatisfied. Because they have not gone through everyone's comparison, they will not realize that these dissatisfactions are completely wrong, and they often attribute these many dissatisfactions to the cadres, thinking that the cadres have problems.
　　Because the comparison meeting is not necessarily held well in every village, if the village does not hold it well, the fruits of labor cannot be distributed fairly and reasonably. In order to correct the problems of these villages that did not hold comparison meetings well, and to alert the cadres of other villages, a top-down general inspection can be carried out when necessary, bringing together cadres from surrounding villages to deeply inspect the fruit distribution work in these villages.
　　After everyone inspects separately, collectively conduct a research to find out the advantages and disadvantages of the village, introduce experiences, correct shortcomings, and broadcast the results of the inspection to various villages. This will not only improve the fruit distribution work of the inspected village, but also give the cadres participating in the inspection an additional experience, learn from their advantages, and no longer make these mistakes.

　　比较会和大检查
    为了把果实真正分配的公平合理，在等级确定，并已按户研究好具体分法以后，应该发动群众进行一次检查，这就是比较会。
    每户的等级和具体分法评定以后，一般的有两种公布办法，或是以村为单位出果实分配草榜，或是召开全体大会来宣布。前一种办法比较麻烦、费事，但它的好处是便于群众检查，因为在全体会上宣布，人数太多了，既不容易听得清楚，而且群众也只能记住几个熟人的等级和分到的数目。这样，比较起来就不会更做得深入细致。所以，如没有太大的困难的话，最好还是出一张草榜。
    果实分配草榜公布后，就开大会动员大家提意见，互相比较。这时，领导上应着重提出“有话就说，谁有意见提出来是民主。”“不满意的不要觉得不好意思说，算完账分了地，再说就晚了。”“比较是争公平，不是自私自利。”“先小人后君子”等口号，来启发群众，打破大家拉不开情面的顾虑，刺激大家多提意见。为了让群众回味、思想转湾，仔细的和别人比较，要给大家留出一两天的时间，进行个别酝酿，家庭研究和小组讨论。
    比较会能否开得好，完全要看群众酝酿的好坏来决定，所以，必须在村里掀起互相比较的热潮，发动全体会员群众，人人酝酿，个个争辩，互相询问等级，较量高低；并以户为单位召开家庭会议，全家人来共同商酌。大武柳林开家庭会的时候，连小孩子（儿童团员）和大姑娘（姐妹团员）也都参加了争论，向他们的家长乱问：“咱几等？人家几等？”“咱为啥比旁人低呢？”“咱分得那块地怎样？”造成了大街小巷到处议论的空气。个别酝酿的差不多了，各团体就分别召开小组会，每个人把自己的意见提出来，经过小组的初步研究，准备好向大会提出的意见。
    等到酝酿成熟了，再召开全村的互相比较会，展开热烈的讨论和争辩。然后，把所有的意见集中起来，由斗争果实分配委员会先共同评议一下，决定如何处理，再在大会上宣布，由群众表决通过，最后确定了每个人的等级和分配数目，就出正式榜。
    经过如此认真的检查，按照大家最后所议定的等级、数目和东西来分，是完全可以做到公平合理了。同时，在互相比较中，群众从自己利益出发，提出争辩，经过大家的一再比较，讨论和评议，他就会逐渐看到大家的利益，于是，群众就提高了一步。否则，区干和村干再公道，纵使没有一点错误，群众也总难免有些不满意，由于没有经过大家的比较，他就不会认识这些不满意是完全不对的，往往便把这许多的不满推到干部身上，认为是干部有毛病。
    因为比较会不一定每个村子都开得好，那个村子开不好，果实就不能分得公平合理。为了使这些没开好比较会的村庄的毛病纠正过来，并使别的村庄的干部加以警惕，必要时，可以举行自上而下的大检查，集中周围各村的干部，来深入检查这些村庄的分果实工作。
    大家分头检查后，集体进行一番研究，找出该村的好处和毛病，介绍经验，纠正缺点，把检查的结果广播到各村去。这不仅使被检查村庄的分果实工作得到了改进，参加检查的干部也会更增加一次经验、学习了他们的好处，而不再犯这些毛病了。
