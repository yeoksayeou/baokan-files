　　"One mistake ruined the family, a second mistake will cost lives"
    Nantong landlords who were deceived return home
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th] Zhao Hede, Zhao Yulin, Zhao Sanhu, Yan Qianquan and other landlords from Nantong Chengguan District, mistakenly believed rumors spread by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. In October, they took their family property and fled to Nantong city and joined the "Homecoming Corps." However, Zhao Hede only received one-third of the eighty *dan* of grain he transported to the city. Zhao Yulin and Zhao Sanhu's fifteen *dan* of rice were all confiscated as "public" property. Yan Qianquan had a large ox taken away by Xu Feng, the Chiang-appointed village chief, and the pigs were also taken away to "comfort" the Chiang army, who said, "What is yours and mine now? We must distribute it reasonably." Renting a room in the city cost six *dou* of rice per month. Yan Qianquan and his wife could only afford two meals of coarse cornmeal a day, lamenting, "Moving here has left us with nothing." Zhao Yulin, Zhao Sanhu, and others have recently returned to their hometown and reported to the democratic government, saying: "One mistake cannot be repeated. One mistake has ruined the family, and another mistake will cost lives." The democratic government comforted and resettled them.

　　“一错家已破再错人要亡”
    南通被骗地主返乡
    【新华社华中五日电】南通城关区地主赵和德、赵玉林、赵三虎、严倩铨等，误信蒋介石特务谣言，于十月间携带家产逃往南通城内，并参加“还乡团”；但赵和德所运八十担粮，到城里只领到三分之一。赵玉林、赵三虎十五担稻，则被全部缴“公”。严倩铨一条大牛被蒋记乡长许凤牵走，猪亦被捉去“慰劳”蒋军，且说：“现在还有什么你的我的？我们要合理分配。”城内租房一间，月需租米六斗。严倩铨夫妇每日仅以两顿粗面糊口，哭诉“搬了家就没了家”。赵玉林、赵三虎等近已重返家乡，报告民主政府说：“一错不能再错，一错已家破，再错人要亡了。”当经民主政府抚慰安家。
