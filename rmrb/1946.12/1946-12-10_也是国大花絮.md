　　More Anecdotes from the National Assembly
　　    Dongfang Man
　　"National Assembly," "National Assembly," a bunch of piglets squeezing and jostling, officials jumping around, with no real good show to watch. Thus, reporters from newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai had to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings at the assembly. I happened to see some interesting excerpts from the opening ceremony anecdotes in the Wenhui Bao on November 16th, which I will discuss here.

　　"Strange cases occur one after another at the venue. The spring cushion of the chair prepared for Chairman Chiang on the stage went missing two days before the meeting. The wooden frame has now been sent to the detective office for detailed fingerprint analysis."

　　A petty thief steals from a big robber – a wonderful theft and also a good satire. It's like announcing on the spot: The people under your rule are starving to death, and your Excellency is not sitting comfortably!

　　"Representatives draw lots to determine their seats. Chairman Chiang and his wife drew numbers 0001 and 0002, respectively, conveniently next to each other."

　　What a "coincidence"! Were the "National Representatives" with numbers one and two unwilling to draw lots fairly? Or did the slips with numbers 0001 and 0002, like Zeng Qi and Zhang Junmai, lack spine and dared not run into the hands of the number one and two villains?

　　"Social notables Mo Dehui, Qian Yongming, Fu Sinian, Li Zhuchen, Hu Zhengzhi, and Minister Wang Yunwu all attended. But they were all like country bumpkin girls, shy and evasive, difficult for news reporters to spot, and left hurriedly after the meeting."

　　This passage is vividly depicted, but the analogy is inappropriate. Our country girls in the liberated areas do not shy away from mass rallies. Because they attend meetings that are self-directed and representative of themselves and the people, their conscience is clear; unlike those who are tricked or dragged in to fill seats, who can't bear to be seen.

　　"What is particularly unexpected is that the venue was filled with cigarette smoke, and many people were dozing off or reading newspapers, which was quite common."

　　The lackeys perform duties for their masters, hold the fort, and fill a seat; the task is complete, so what else can they do but doze off? But they will have busy and tense times; if you don't believe me, reporters, go and take a look when they are vying for the chairmanship, dividing the spoils, and grabbing official positions!

　　也是国大花絮
    东方漫
    “国大”，“国大”，一窝猪仔挤挤拱拱，加官跳来跳去，没有什么整本好戏可看，于是京、沪各报记者就只好大写其会场花絮。偶见十一月十六日文汇报所载的开幕花絮，颇觉有趣，这里且摘引几段谈谈。

    “会场奇案叠出，主席台上为蒋主席预备之座椅弹簧皮垫，开会前两日失踪。现已将木架送至侦缉室，详研指纹。”
    小偷儿偷了大强盗，是妙偷窃也是好讽刺。好像当场宣布一般：你治下的百姓都快饿死了，阁下的屁股是坐不舒服的！

    “各代表抽签定座。蒋主席夫妇一为○○○一号，一为○○○二号，适为比邻。”
    “适”得巧！是一号二号的“国民代表”不肯平等抽笺呢？还是○○○一号、○○○二号笺子，也像曾琦、张君卖一样没有骨头，不敢不往一号二号恶人的手中跑？

    “社会贤达莫德惠、钱永铭、傅斯年、李烛尘、胡政之及部长王云五均出席。但都像乡下大姑娘，羞羞涩涩，躲躲闪闪，不易为新闻记者发觉，散会时即匆蘧离场。”
    这段刻画得情态逼真，可惜比喻不当。我们解放区的乡下大姑娘参加群众大会，就不羞涩躲闪。因为她们是自顾自主地出席足以代表自己和人民的大会，其心无愧；不像被拐诱强拉来帮场凑数的，见不得人。

    “殊出一般意外者，则为大会场中居然香烟缭绕，并有人大打磕睡，阅看书报，比比皆是。”
    奴才替主子打执事，撑场面，填上一个座席，任务已完，不打磕睡做什么？但，他们会有忙乱紧张的时候的；不信，等争主席，分赃款，夺官位时，各报记者再去瞧瞧！
