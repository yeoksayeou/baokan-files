    【Reported by our newspaper from Taiyue on the 27th】The mass movement in Shi Min County has entered its final climax of general liquidation. In the first district, the movements in more than ten villages including Duanshi, Douzhuang, Guobi, and Huojiashan have reached a climax, with villagers participating in the struggle in droves. In the Duanshi struggle against Jia Lude, villagers from eleven villages participated, shouting like thunder: "We want our land back, we want our property back!" The villages in the second district have started struggles one after another, especially in Panzhuang. After a major inspection, it was discovered that eighteen landlord households still had 694 mu of land (originally 760 mu), and unanimously proposed "training troops" (the masses' way of saying they were preparing in advance) to engage in a "final battle" with the landlords. After inspection in the fifth district, starting with the struggle against the landlord Zhang Dunfu in Langbi, more than 90% of the villagers in the district came forward to settle accounts with the landlords and local bullies, and women also participated in the struggle. In the joint struggle against Jia Lude by villagers from eleven villages in the first district, they poured out their grievances for seven days and struggled for seven days, completely pouring out decades of bitterness and digging out this old feudal root. In the struggle, more than 90% of the villagers were united as never before, which was due to the proper handling of the middle peasant issue. For example, before the struggle in Langbi in the fifth district, many of the eighteen landlord and bully households in the village had accomplices who were middle peasants, and even some poor peasants. Therefore, they were first organized and educated to recognize that they were poor people and the landlords were enemies, and to let them repent, confess, and stand on the side of the peasants. For example, Guo Douyuan said: "A few days ago, I told the landlord Cui Bingyu to sell his cattle quickly, so they wouldn't be taken away, but now I realize that this hurt myself, and Cui Bingyu's family property has some of my blood and sweat in it." So he was very active in this struggle. Just as the struggle began, the troops set off to fight Yuanqu, and most of the men went to the front, so the women organized the struggle and liquidation at home. More than 100 women participated in the struggle in Langbi, and they struggled just as resolutely. After the Zhang brothers were overthrown in the struggle, Huo Xiulian said: "I've grown up for more than ten years and haven't had a chance to visit other people's homes, but today I can walk around here as I please." Now the mass movement in the county is continuing to move towards a climax.

　　村村农民成群结队参加斗争
    士敏总清算已达高潮
    【本报太岳二十七日电】士敏全县群众运动已进入最后总清算高潮。一区端氏、窦庄、郭必，霍家山等十余村运动已达高潮，成群结队的农民参加斗争。端氏斗争贾路德有十一个村庄的农民参加，喊声如雷：“要回咱们的土地，要回咱们的财产！”二区各村已先后开始斗争，尤其是潘庄，经过大检查后，发现十八户地主还有土地六百九十四亩，（原有七百六十亩）一致提出“练兵”，（群众对事先酝酿工作的说法）与地主进行“总决战”。五区经过检查后，从斗争朗壁地主张敦福开始，全区百分之九十以上的农民，纷纷来向地主恶霸大清算，妇女也参加了斗争。一区十一村农民联合斗争贾路德，诉苦七天斗争七天，把数十年来的苦水倒净了，挖掉了这个封建老根。斗争中百分之九十以上的农民空前团结，这是由于中农问题处理的好，如五区朗壁斗争前村中十八户地主、恶霸，他们有不少的爪牙是中农，甚至有些贫农，所以先把他们组织起来教育，认识自己是苦人，地主是仇人，让其悔过坦白站到农民方面来。如郭斗元说：“我前几天还给地主崔炳余说，叫他把牛赶快卖了，可别给人家斗走了，现在才知道这伤害了自己，崔炳余的家产有我一份血汗。”所以在这次斗争中表现很积极。正当斗争开始时又碰上队伍出发打垣曲，男人大部分上前方去了，女人就在家组织斗争清算。朗壁斗争中有一百多女人参加，她们一样坚决斗争。在斗倒张家兄弟后，霍秀莲说：“我长了十多岁没赶来人家门上看看走走，今天可在这里随便走了。”现在全县群众运动正继续走向高潮。
