　　Using Knees as Desks to Scrape Stubble for Wages
    Zhangzhong Students Overcome New Difficulties
    [This Newspaper] Taihang Zhangbin Middle School is adapting to the war environment and overcoming various difficulties, setting off a new wave of enthusiasm for learning. In order to persist in completing the teaching plan during the Patriotic Self-Defense War, the school relocated last month. There was a shortage of school buildings, desks, and benches in the new location, which affected the learning mood of some students. The leadership immediately led everyone to discuss current affairs, clear up their thinking, and asked "Who won't let us study in our own school?" "Who won't let us use our own new desks and benches?" After heated discussions, the students realized that "these difficulties are all given to us by Chiang Kai-shek, and if we want to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, we must overcome difficulties and complete the learning plan." They also proposed: "Knees can be desks, and rooftops can be classrooms." Everyone made personal study plans and launched competitions, setting off a new wave of enthusiasm for learning; students attended classes in the courtyard and on the rooftop in the sunlight, taking notes on their laps and writing wall newspapers. In the past month, 70% of the students have completed their study plans, and some have even exceeded them. The new location is remote and isolated. In order to ensure the implementation of the study plan, the students personally went to distant places to buy vegetables. Wang Runhe carried 80 jin on one shoulder, so tired that he was covered in sweat but refused to rest. Students with economic difficulties scraped stubble for the local villagers. In three days, 60 work units had scraped 16 mu of land, earning 368 jin of rice in wages.

　　膝盖当桌子刨茬赚工资
    漳中学生战胜新困难
    【本报讯】太行漳滨中学适应战争环境克服各种困难，掀起新的学习热潮。该校为了在爱国自卫战争中坚持完成教学计划，曾在上月转移校址。新驻地的校舍、桌凳均感困难，影响了部分学员的学习情绪。领导上立即领导大家讨论时事，打通思想，提出“谁不叫我们在自己的学校里学习？”“谁不叫我们用自己的新桌、凳？”学员们经过热烈讨论，发现“这些困难都是蒋介石给我们的，我们要打垮蒋介石进攻，就要克服困难，完成学习计划。”并提出：“膝盖就是桌子，房顶可当课堂”。大家纷纷订出个人学习计划，并展开竞赛，掀起了新的学习热潮；学员们在院子里，房顶上的阳光中上课，在大腿上记笔记，写墙报。一月来百分之七十的学员已完成学习计划，有的并已超过。新驻地偏僻闭塞，学员们为保证学习计划的进行，亲自到远地买菜，汪润河一担就担了八十斤，累得满身大汗还不肯休息。经济困难的学员给驻地老乡刨茬，三天中，六十个工已刨田十六亩，得工资米三百六十八斤。
