　　How to Conduct Ideological Education?
    The Experience of Xia'ensha District

    Expanding the Party's Influence Among the Masses
    In Sha District, each of our work teams has a comrade who openly reveals their identity as a Party member to the masses and publicizes to the masses: "Helping the common people to stand up is Chairman Mao's idea." Therefore, an old man in Zhu Village, fearing that he would never see Chairman Mao in his lifetime, and a poor peasant in Gucheng proposed: "Every family should invite a portrait of Chairman Mao and bow three times a day." Fang Jintian, a mass leader in the Eighth District, said: "I am a fifty-year-old man about to be buried, and I didn't want to get involved, but seeing that the comrades have no official airs, sitting on the ground and talking to me, I have to sell this old bone to serve the masses until I die." Expanding the Party's influence has laid the foundation for educating the masses to follow the Communist Party.
    Understanding Policies Through Action
    To strengthen mass education, we must continuously raise the consciousness of the masses in the development of the movement. For example, when the masses in the First District were greatly mobilized, we immediately put forward "Middle and poor peasants are one family" and "Resolutely do not struggle against middle peasants" based on the advanced experience of Dongzitou Village. "Felling big trees provides firewood." This raised the consciousness of the peasants in the great movement a step further. The struggle example of Wang Village in the Eighth District was used to convene a district-wide peasant representative meeting, and the villagers discussed the handling of the illegal landlord in Wang Village. From the discussion, everyone proposed that things taken from middle peasants during struggle should be returned. Only by following the mass line in this way can the masses improve their consciousness and understand our Party's policies through their own actions.
    Convening "Think-Think Meetings"
    The full consciousness of the masses depends on thorough and complete awareness. The method we use is to hold "Think-Think Meetings" where the masses consciously reflect. At the "Think-Think Meeting," Liu Xishun said: "I used to send intelligence to the 'second devils' (puppet soldiers) and get some money from it, but in the end, the 'second devils' ruined me. When the Eighth Route Army came, they redeemed the land and distributed things. What I did before was unfair to Chairman Mao. If I do another bad thing in the future, I'll be struck by a bullet when I go out." Zhao Changxing said: "Today we have food and drink and are not bullied. This emancipation is temporary. If we want to be emancipated forever, we have to dig up the root. Chiang Kai-shek is the root, and the landlord is the sprout. When it's sunny, we'll dry the sprout to death. If there is a root, it can still grow. If we want to dig up the root, we have to drive away Chiang Kai-shek and join the regular army." Liu Jilin, a hired worker from × Village, said: "Now I can sit at the table when people get married, but before I was either driving a car or carrying water. In the future, when we go out and see a portrait of Chairman Mao, we must bow." The reason why this village is doing so well is mainly because they grasp the idea of saying whatever they have to say, avoiding large meetings and carrying it out in small groups and families. Ji Village further proposed: "What kind of village government do we want in our village?" "Who has conflicts with whom?" "How to help women stand up?" Whatever is proposed, the masses consciously solve it. For example, after the Think-Think Meeting, the activists of Mumao Village did not sleep for two nights in order to do a better job. Huang Village’s Farmers' Association Director was so busy with work that he didn't eat for a day. This enthusiasm, built on a conscious basis, makes the "Think-Think Meeting" not only transform the thinking of the masses but also forms a good way to promote work.
    In short, to fully mobilize the masses, we must strengthen education, raise awareness, and make the masses consciously follow the Communist Party so that they can withstand storms.

　　怎样进行思想教育？
    夏恩沙区经验
    东宁
    扩大党在群众中的影响
    在沙区，我们每个工作组有一个同志向群众公开自己党员面目，并向群众宣传：“帮助老百姓翻身是毛主席的主意。”因而朱庄有一个老头，怕一辈子见不了毛主席，古城一个贫农提议：“家家请个毛主席像，一天三鞠躬。”八区群众领袖方金田说：“我五十岁将要入土的人了，本不想管事，可是看到同志们没一点官架，往地下一坐就找我说话，到死也得卖卖这份老给群众办事。”扩大了党的影响，也就打下教育群众跟着共产党走的基础。
    从行动中认识政策
    加强群众教育，必须在运动发展中不断提高群众觉悟。如一区当群众大动起来，立即依据洞子头村的先进经验，提出“中贫农是一家。”“坚决不斗中农。”“搬倒大树有柴烧”。这样就把大动中农民觉悟提高了一步。八区用于王庄的斗争实例，开全区农代会，由各村讨论，处理于王庄的不法地主，从讨论中大家提出斗了中农的东西要退回，这样走群众路线，才能使群众从自己行动中提高觉悟，认识我党政策。
    召开“想想会”
    群众的充分觉悟要依靠彻头彻尾的自觉，我们进行的办法是开“想想会”，群众自觉的反省。在“想想会”上，刘希顺说：“我以前给二鬼子（伪军）送情报，从里边分个钱，但末了二鬼子又把我搞光了。八路军来了，赎了地，又分了东西。以前做的事可对不住毛主席，以后我再办一桩坏事，出门碰枪子”。赵长兴说：“今天有吃有喝不受气，这翻身是一时的，要想永远翻身，还得挖根，老蒋是根，地主是芽，天晴了把芽晒死，有根还能长，要想挖根得打走老蒋，参加正规军。”×村雇工刘继临说：“现在人家娶媳妇我也能坐上席了，在以前我不是驶车，就是担水。以后咱们出门在那里见了毛主席的像要鞠躬。”该村所以搞的好，主要掌握有啥说啥，避开大会而以小组家庭为单位搞起来的。吉庄更进一步提出：“咱村愿意要什么样的村政权？”“咱们谁和谁有蹩扭？”“怎样帮助妇女翻过身来？”提出什么，群众就有意识的解决了什么。又如目茅庄积极分子，经过想想会，为进一上步把工作做好，两夜未睡。黄庄农会主任忙于工作，一天没吃饭。这种热情，建立在自觉的基础上，使“想想会”不仅改造群众思想，还形成推动工作的好办法。
    总之充分发动群众，必须加强教育，提高觉悟，使群众自觉的跟着共产党走，才能经得起狂风暴雨。
