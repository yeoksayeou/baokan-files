Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. Ms. Deng Yingchao, one of the leaders of Chinese women, was previously invited to attend international women's conferences held in France and the United States, but was unable to attend due to unreasonable obstruction by the Kuomintang authorities. However, Ms. Deng has sent the opinions of women from all walks of life in China and the liberated areas, as well as information on the women's movement in the liberated areas, along with photographs, industrial products, and artworks, to France and the United States for the Women's Congress to consider. Ms. Deng has received a reply from Mrs. Carter, Chairman of the Steering Committee of the International Women's Conference held in the United States, as follows: Mrs. Zhou Enlai:
	I have received all the materials and letters you sent me, and I am very interested in them. I think it is a meaningful work that you have listed the interests of women in your area and organized discussion groups. ...
	I think the International Women's Congress is very useful, especially for uniting people from different political, economic, and cultural backgrounds. During the ten-day conference, we can see how old prejudices and misunderstandings disappear and new friendships are established. ...I think what you are doing is very important, not only to express women's feelings, but also from an educational point of view. ...
		Mrs. Carter, November 1st

　　国际妇女大会卡特尔夫人复函邓颖超同志
  　对解放区妇运甚重视
    【新华社延安三日电】中国妇女领袖之一邓颖超女士，前曾被邀出席在法、美两国举行之国际妇女会议，均因国民党当局无理阻挠未能出席参加。惟邓女士已将国内各界及解放区妇女意见，并解放区妇运情况以及照片工业品、艺术品等，先后寄往法美两国，提供妇女大会参考。邓女士已接获在美国举行的国际妇女会议指导委员会主席卡特尔夫人之复函如下：周恩来夫人：
    你送给我的材料并信，我已全部收到，我对这些材料甚感兴趣，我认为你把你们地区妇女的利益列举出来，以及组织讨论会等，乃是一件有意义的工作。……
    国际妇女大会，我认为很有用，特别对于团结各种政治经济文化背景不同的人民。我们在十天会议中可以看到旧的成见与误会如何消失和新的友谊的建立。………我觉得你所做的很重要，不仅仅是表示妇女的感觉，而且是从教育的观点出发。…………………
　　　        卡特尔夫人十一月一日
