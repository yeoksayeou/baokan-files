　　The justice of the self-defense war waged by the military and civilians in the liberated areas will surely make our army stronger as it fights; this is true for the main force, and it is also true for the militia and local armed forces. The local armed forces of Shouyang in the Taihang Mountains, in the battle of Bishisui Village, actually used a small unit to capture many small cannons, machine guns, and rifles from the enemy, creating a new record of zero to ninety, beautifully proving this truth.
　　The People's Liberation Army is indeed doing its best, small and large alike. Large formations can fight big victories, small units can fight small victories, and the militia and local armed forces are winning battles everywhere, not only accumulating small victories into large victories, but also containing and exhausting the enemy, making it easier for the main force to seize the initiative and fight more and bigger victories. Therefore, this has a great effect on the overall war. We hope that the local armed forces in all liberated areas will learn from the Shouyang troops, improve their combat effectiveness, and fight more beautiful battles. We hope that the main force corps will better care for and help the establishment and development of local armed forces. The militia in all liberated areas should work harder to gradually improve to the level of the Shouyang local troops, and create new records of zero to one hundred, zero to two hundred.

　　向寿阳地方武装看齐
    解放区军民自卫战的正义性，一定使我军愈战愈强，主力如此，民兵地方武装仍然如此。太行寿阳的地方武装在碧石随村战斗中，竟以一个小部队缴获敌人很多的小炮机枪和步枪，创造了零比九十的新纪录，漂亮的证明了这一真理。
    解放军确乎是做到各尽其能，小大由之，大兵团能打大胜仗，小部队能打小胜仗，民兵地方武装到处打胜仗，不仅积小胜为大胜，而且牵制和困疲敌人，便于主力争取主动，打更多和更大的胜仗。因此这对战争全面有极大作用，我们希望全解放区的地方武装，都向寿阳部队看齐，提高自己的战斗力，打更多的漂亮仗，希望主力兵团要更好的关心与帮助地方武装的建立和发展。全解放区的民兵要更加努力逐渐提高到寿阳地方部队那样的水平，创造零比一百，零比二百的新纪录。
