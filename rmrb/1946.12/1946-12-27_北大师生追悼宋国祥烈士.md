　　North University Faculty and Students Commemorate Martyr Song Guoxiang

　　[Report from our North University correspondent] On December 15th, 1,200 faculty and students from North University solemnly mourned Comrade Song Guoxiang, a student of the Medical College, who gloriously sacrificed his life. Song was a member of the Chinese Communist Party, 21 years old this year. He joined the Seventh Brigade Health Department of the Jinnan Eighth Route Army as a nurse when the Anti-Japanese War began in 1937. After eight years of fighting, he demonstrated great determination and bravery in the fight against the Rightists (Shi Yousan), the "mopping-up" campaigns, the "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, and the famine of 1942. In 1943, he sheltered 18 wounded and sick soldiers in a tunnel. He came to North University to study this February. In July, when Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale civil war and attacked the Jilu Yu liberated area, Comrade Song immediately abandoned his pen for the army and went to the front with the Fourth Medical Team; he died saving the wounded in the Dayang Lake battle. Principal Fan, in his eulogy, called on everyone to avenge the dead! (Shao Ziqiang, Yu Sheng, Quan Zhong)

　　北大师生追悼宋国祥烈士
    【本报北大讯】十二月十五日，北方大学一千二百师生，沉痛追悼光荣殉职的医学院学生宋国祥同志。宋为中国共产党员，今年二十一岁，三七年抗战开始即参加冀南八路军七旅卫生处看护工作。转战八载，曾在反右（石友三）、反“扫荡”、反“围剿”及四二年渡荒中表现了极大坚决和英勇。四三年曾在地道中招呼过十八个伤病员。今年二月到北大学习。七月，因蒋介石发动大规模内战，进攻冀鲁豫解放区，宋同志即投笔从戎，随医疗四区队到前方；于大杨湖战斗中，因抢救伤员殉职。范校长在悼词中号召大家要为死者复仇！（邵自强、于声、全忠）
