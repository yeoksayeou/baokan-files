How to Achieve Reasonable Leveling Based on the Original Wealth Distribution of the Masses?
    ——The Experience of Fruit Distribution in Taixi
    Tang Ximin

The so-called "leveling" and "grading" means using a portion of the fruits to level out the ultra-poor and poor peasants, and another portion of the fruits is distributed according to grades, so that everyone gets a share. This is to eliminate the ultra-poor and poor peasants as much as possible, so that everyone has land to cultivate; on the other hand, to appropriately take care of the middle peasants and other masses, so that everyone gets a little benefit, and achieve the goal of uniting more than 90% of the peasants; therefore, the former should be the main and the latter should be supplementary. The general method is: all the land is distributed to the ultra-poor peasants for leveling purposes; grains, furniture, and other fruits are distributed fairly to all the villagers according to the principle of the poor getting more and the rich getting less.

However, the original distribution of land, population, and wealth among the masses is very complicated. Land varies in quality, people are different, relationships are complex, and there are many problems. Because the difference in land quality is very large, one mu of good land can be worth three or four mu of bad land. Some households have a lot of land in terms of mu, but the land is very bad, and the harvest is very small. Some households do not have much land, but the land is good and it is paddy field. After converting it into ordinary land, it actually far exceeds the households with more land. If we only calculate the amount of land per household, the result of leveling and making up the difference will definitely not be fair. In terms of population, there are also differences such as hired laborers, tenant farmers, people who work away from home, military dependents, martyrs' dependents, and puppet dependents. Who should be given a share? Who should not be given a share? Who should be given more and who should be given less? There should be some distinctions in order to be fair and reasonable, so that those who should be taken care of are taken care of, and those who should not be given a share are not given a share. This is the preparation work that all localities must do before distributing the fruits.

How to achieve a fair and reasonable distribution based on the original property of the masses? The main thing is to do the following three specific tasks well.

A. Population registration. The method of Dawu Liulin is: (1) Hired laborers who work in other villages from this village are given leveled land by this village, but they do not share the fruits. Hired laborers who work in this village from other villages are not leveled, but are given fruits as one person. (2) Tenant farmers who have settled in this village are given the same share as the villagers; if they still mainly live in their old home and participate in the struggle in the village where they are living, they are only given fruits as one person and are not leveled. (3) People who work away from home. Coolies who go out of Xiaguan and apprentices who are in the Jiang-controlled areas are all given leveled land, but the land they should have is deducted, and they do not share the fruits. (4) Those who are in the Jiang army are not counted as population, and their families are given the same share as others. (5) Soldiers and martyrs are still counted as one person, and are given both leveled land and fruits. After the military dependents and martyrs' dependents are leveled, they are also raised by one grade. (6) If a family is both a military dependent and a puppet dependent, they offset each other and are equal to ordinary people. (7) Fugitive soldiers should be recovered for the fruits they deserve (the land is still leveled).

B. Land registration. Land registration has two functions: (1) To solve the long-standing land problem of farmers by household, such as mortgaged land, clan land, and old-age land, clarify their complex relationships, and determine land ownership. The method of Mazhuang is: if the number of mortgaged land is below the number of leveled land, it will be owned by the tenant farmer as a dead deed. If it exceeds the number, the peasants below the middle peasants will be compensated at the original price; the middle peasants and above will be compensated for a part, and both will be redeemed by the farmers' association for unified leveling. Clan land will be distributed to poor peasants of the clan for their livelihood according to the number of leveled land. (2) To convert good land, bad land, paddy fields, and slope land into medium-grade land according to the quality of the land and the amount of harvest. Xuanjiazhuang divides the land into three grades: upper, middle, and lower. One mu of upper-grade land is converted into 1.4 mu of middle-grade land, and one mu of lower-grade land is converted into 0.7 mu of middle-grade land. The original differences are eliminated to achieve rationality.

C. In addition, one thing that must be done is to clear the accounts. For example, whether the poor peasants should repay the debts owed to the landlords (referring to reasonable loans), whether the landlords should pay the debts owed to the poor peasants? Deduct from the fruits? Or should the landlords still repay? It can be announced to the masses and let the masses comment and solve it. Because these debts are not large, each village has decided this way: the former will no longer be returned to the landlords, but will also be distributed as fruits. The debts of the farmers can be deducted from the fruits that should be distributed. The latter is generally still repaid by the landlords. If they really cannot afford to repay, it will be paid from the fruits.

Regarding the method of land leveling, Xuanjiazhuang has a total of 67 ultra-poor peasant households, with a total of 288 people and 112.4 mu of large land. (One mu of large land in Taixi is 720 square steps). This time, 84.9 mu of large land were cleared and all of them were leveled to the ultra-poor peasants. Each person should be leveled to 0.65 mu of large land. Because the military dependents and martyrs' dependents should be given more, in fact, each person can only be leveled to 0.55 mu. The original land is used as the basis, and the amount of land to be leveled is based on the standard of the number to be leveled, and the difference is made up. Military dependents and martyrs' dependents and the ultra-poor should be given paddy fields and land close to the village as much as possible, and military dependents and martyrs' dependents should be given 0.15 mu more than ordinary people. Poor peasants are allocated land according to their needs. Those who have mountain land are allocated some paddy fields, and those who have paddy fields are allocated some mountain land.

There are also eight poor peasant households in the village who have not participated in mass organizations, including the former puppet village chief and merchants who ran to Jinan. Because they are not progressive and the masses hate them, they were not allowed to participate before. This time, they were also taken care of when distributing the fruits. Each person was first given 0.3 mu of good land, and they were absorbed into the association. If they improve in the future, they will be leveled to 0.55 mu. In addition, there are 28 households in the village who fled during the great famine in 1943 who have not all returned. According to the current number of people and the amount of land at home, they cannot be allocated land. However, in order to take care of their lives after they return home in the future, 6.7 mu of paddy fields are specially set aside to be distributed to them when they return, and will be used to level the above-mentioned eight poor peasant households in the future. At present, it is cultivated by the militia, and all income is used for the militia's military expenditures.

As for the distribution of grains and furniture and other fruits, they are all converted into grain for unified calculation. In addition to awarding a portion to activists, victims, and militia (Xuanjiazhuang awarded 2,500 jin to activists, the victims were divided into three grades, and each person received a reward of 20 to 50 jin, and the militia each received a reward of 200 jin), Xuanjiazhuang distributed according to five grades. Beisu Village distributed more grades, a total of ten grades. Those without land are counted as the first grade, those below 0.1 mu are the second grade, and each additional 0.05 mu is a difference of one grade. Except for the liquidation targets and the rich peasants who should not be distributed the fruits, those above 0.45 mu are all counted as the tenth grade. The number of shares is more for the poor and less for the rich. The first and second grades should be given particularly more. The first grade is 380 jin per person, the third grade is reduced to 200 jin, and the tenth grade can only be distributed 8 jin per person. Among the 220 households in the village, 196 households were distributed the fruits, including 42 middle peasant households, which truly achieved taking care of the majority and uniting more than 90% of the peasants.

For widows and orphans, in order to take care of the shortcomings of their small share of fruits, a special remedy was stipulated. One person increases by two people, and two people increase by one person, all distributed according to three people. No more increases for three or more people.

　　怎样在群众原有财富分配基础上做到合理填平？
    ——泰西分果实经验
    唐西民
    所谓“填平”“分等”，就是以一部分果实来填平赤贫和贫农，另以一部分果实按等级分配，大家都有一份。这是为了一方面要尽量消灭赤贫和贫农，做到人人有地种；另一方面适当的照顾中农和其他群众，使每个人都得到一点利益，达到团结百分之九十以上农民的目的；因此，应以前者为主后者为附。一般的办法是：土地全部分给赤贫农，作填平之用；粮食、家具等其他果实，则按穷多富少的原则，公平分给全村群众。
    但群众原有的土地、人口、财富的分配是非常复杂的，地有好坏，人有不同，关系复杂，问题颇多。因地之好坏悬殊甚大，有一亩能顶三四亩者，有的户土地亩数倒是不少，但地很坏，按收获量来看，甚为寥寥；有的户土地亩数确乎不多，可是地好又是水田，折成普通地后，实在远远的超过了地多户。如单以每户地亩数量多少计算，实行填平补齐的结果，一定就不会公平。在人口方面，也有雇工、寄庄户、出外人口、军属、烈属、伪属等不同，那些人该分？那些人不该分？谁多分谁少分？都应有所区别，才能公平合理，做到应该照顾的人都照顾到了，不该分的人都不分。这是各地在分配果实前，首先必需作的准备工作。
    怎样在群众原有财产基础上求得公平合理的分配呢？主要须把下面三个具体工作做好。
    甲、人口登记。大武柳林的办法是：（一）本庄在外庄做活的雇工，本村给填平地，本人不分果实。外庄在本村做活的雇工，不填平，按一人分果实。（二）寄庄户已在本庄安家者，和本村人一样分；如仍以老家为主，在寄住村参加斗争，只按一人分果实，不填平。（三）出外人口。下关外出苦力和在蒋管区当学徒的均给填平，但除出本人所平均地数，不分果实。（四）当蒋军的，本人不算人口，家属和别人一样分。（五）战士和烈士本人仍算一口人，既给填平也分果实，军属和烈属填平后，并提高一等。（六）一家是军属又是伪属，互相对消，和一般人相等。（七）逃亡战士应追回本人应得果实（土地仍补齐）。
    乙、土地登记。土地登记有两种作用：（一）以户为单位解决农民久压的土地问题，如押地、族地、养老地等，澄清其复杂关系，确定地权所属。马庄的办法是：押地数目在补齐数以下者，即作为死契归承种户所有。超过部分，中农以下按原价；中农以上的量补偿一部分，二者均由农会赎回统一填补。族地则按补齐数分给本族贫农为业。（二）把好地、坏地、水田、坡地，按地好坏和收获量多少，折成中等地。铉家庄把地分成上、中、下三等，上等一亩折中等地一亩四，下等一亩折中等地七分。取消了原有的差别，求得合理。
    丙、再加一件必须要作的是清理帐目。如贫农欠地主的是否要还（指合理借贷说），地主欠贫农的是否算？由果实内扣除？还是仍由地主归还？可向群众公布，让群众评论解决。因为这些欠帐数目都不大，各村都这样决定：前者不再还给地主，也作为果实分配，欠帐农民可在应分果实内扣除；后者一般的仍由地主还，实在还不起时，从果实内偿付。
    关于土地的填平办法，铉家庄共有赤贫农六十七户，他们共有二百八十八口人，一百十二亩四分大地。（泰西大地一亩，七百二十方步），这次清算回来大地八十四亩九，全部填给赤贫农，每人应补齐到大地六分半，因为军属、烈属要多分一些，实际上每人只能补齐到五分半，便以原有地为基础，按照该补齐的标准，差多少补给多少。军属烈属和赤贫尽量分给水田、近地，军烈属并比一般人多分一分半。贫农则根据需要配地，有山地再配点水田，有水田则分些山地。
    该村还有没参加群众组织的八户贫农，其中有先前的伪村长，跑济南的商人，因为他们不进步，群众讨厌他们，以前没准他们参加。这次分果实时也照顾了他们，每人先给补到三分好地，并吸收他们入会，如将来转变好了，再给他们填平到五分半。另外，该村在一九四三年大灾荒时期逃出去的人，至今尚有二十八户未全部回来，按目前在家的人数和地亩来看，分不着地。不过，为了照顾他们将来回家后的生活，特提出水田六亩七分，准备他们回来时分给他们，并作为以后给上述八户贫农填平之用。现时归民兵耕种，所有收入用作民兵军火开支。
    至于粮食和家具等果实的分配，一律折成粮统一计算。除给积极分子、苦主、民兵等提一部分奖以外（铉家庄共奖励积极分子两千五百斤，苦主分成三等，每人得奖由二十斤至五十斤，民兵每人提奖二百斤），铉家庄是按五等来分，北苏村分得等级更多，共分为十等，无地的算一等，一分以下为二等，以上每多半分差一等，除清算对象和不该分果实的富农外，四分半以上的都作为十等。分的数目是穷多富少，一二等的特别要多分，一等每人三百八十斤，三等的便少到两百斤，十等的则每人只能分到八斤了。在全村二百二十户中，一百九十六户分到果实，其中包括中农四十二户，真正做到了照顾大多数，团结了百分之九十以上的农民。
    对于鳏寡孤独，为了照顾他们分果实少的缺点，特别规定了一个补救办法，一口人的增加两口，两口人的增加一口，都按三口人来分。三口人以上的就不再增加了。
