　　“Good news comes every year, but this week is particularly abundant.” This is a summary of the past week. What good news? Please see:
    Firstly, the stark contrast between the Soviet Union and the United States: the Soviet Union has already completed its annual industrial production plan ahead of schedule this month. This surge in socialist competition is deeply impressive. The new Five-Year Plan is being completed ahead of schedule, while the United States, the largest capitalist power, is undergoing a fierce attack from the 400,000 coal miners' strike, resulting in blast furnaces being extinguished, railway services reduced, and automobile factories closing. The fleeting prosperity of this summer and autumn has vanished, and now all industries are declining.
    Secondly, the French and Italian elections: the results of the French National Assembly elections, as of the 16th of this month, have decided 603 out of 618 seats. The French Communist Party won 186 seats, the Popular Republican Movement 163 seats, and the Socialist Party 103 seats. The subsequent results of the French second chamber election again showed that the French Communist Party ranked first, while the right wing declined. The Italian local elections have once again proven that the alliance between the Communist and Socialist parties is far ahead and unbreakable. The people of France and Italy have decisively leaned to the left. Let the reactionaries mourn the "failure of Western democracy"!
    Thirdly, new phenomena in the United Nations General Assembly: that is, the French representative stood with the Soviet Union on the issue of investigating foreign troops stationed abroad and the World Federation of Trade Unions. The United States' proposal to monopolize international relief through economic and financial committees to achieve its expansionist goals has been rejected. More interestingly, the United Kingdom and the United States have inconsistent steps in reporting military intelligence issues. The inspection system for intelligence provided by various countries proposed by Baker of the United Kingdom was frantically opposed by Connally of the United States, fearing the discovery of any secrets. The situation within the UN this week is a welcome sign, reminding people of the famous saying of British Communist leader Pollitt: "Cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union, France and other European democratic countries" to "counter American capitalist aggression."
    Finally, against the background of the above three situations, there are new developments in the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Trieste issue, which has been entangled for fourteen months, was resolved by a compromise agreement reached by the Four Foreign Ministers after a 75-minute direct meeting between Molotov and Byrnes, thus opening the door to the final completion of the five-nation treaty. This year's Christmas will probably be spent in an atmosphere of harmony among the four powers, just like the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference last year.

　　国际一周
    “佳讯年年有，今周何其多。”这是过去一周的总结。什么佳讯？请看：
    其一为苏美的鲜明对照，苏联已于本月份先期完成本年工业生产计划，这一社会主义竞赛高涨，给人印象甚为强烈。新五年计划正提早完成，而美国这个资本主义的最大强国则经受四十万煤矿工人大罢工的猛烈袭击，弄得鼓风炉熄火，铁道减班，汽车厂关门，今年夏秋间的一度景气有若昙花一现，到如今百业凋零。
    其二为法意选举，法国民议会选举结果，迄本月十六日止，六一八席中已有六○三席决定，计法共得一八六席，人民共和运动党一六三席，社会党一○三席，之后的法国第二院选举结果依然是法共占第一位，右派旁落。意大利的地方选举，再度证明共社两党联盟，遥遥领先，坚不可摧。法意人民决然地左倾了，让反动派哀道“西方民主的失败”吧！
    其三为联合国大会中的新现象，这就是法国代表在调查国外驻军及世界职工联盟问题上和苏联站在一起，美国在经济财政委员会上企图一手包办国际救济，来达其扩张目的提案已被否决。更有意思的是英美在报告军队情报问题上步调参差，英方贝克尔所提建立对各国所提情报的检查制度，为美方康纳利拚命反对，生怕发现什么秘密。这一周联大内的情况是一个可喜的端倪，使人记起了英共领袖波立特的“英苏法及其他欧洲民主国合作”，“对抗美资本主义侵略”的名言。
    最后，就是以上述三种情况为背景的四外长会议的新发展，纠缠了十四个月的的里雅斯特问题，在莫洛托夫与贝纳斯直接会谈七十五分钟后，由四外长作出了折衷性的协议，从此打开了最后完成五国和约的大门。今年的圣诞节，大概将在四强和谐的气氛中渡过，如像去年莫斯科三外长会议时那样。
