　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: A news dispatch from Malaya: The "Singapore English Straits Times," a media outlet close to the British government, published an editorial on November 2nd, accusing the United States of causing the Chinese civil war and advocating for the speedy withdrawal of American troops from China. The newspaper quoted the British authoritative political publication "New Statesman" as saying: "The term 'non-interference' in the American policy towards China is just like the so-called 'non-interference' of Germany and Italy in Spain in the past." It also stated: The views of Chinese and foreign democrats are that "the Chinese government is close to fascism, while the people are of a democratic model." It further quoted Mrs. Cripps, who recently visited Yan'an, as saying: "From the perspective of land policy and other social reforms, and from the perspective of administrative efficiency, the Communist Party is more qualified to ask for Truman's support than the Kuomintang."

    斥美造成中国内战
    【新华社延安十六日电】马来亚讯：接近英政府的舆论机关《新加坡英文海峡时报》于十一月二日发表一篇社论，斥美造成中国内战，主张美军尽速退出中国。该报引英权威政治刊物《新政治家杂志》的话说：“‘不干涉’这名词用在美国对华政策，正如过去德意对西班牙的所谓‘不干涉’一样。”又称：中外民主人士的见解，即“中国政府是接近法西斯，而人民是民主模型的。”并引用最近曾往延安的克利浦斯夫人的话说：“从土地政策及其他社会改革来看，从行政管理效能来看，共产党应该比国民党更有资格要求杜鲁门的支援。”
