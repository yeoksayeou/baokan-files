    Resolutely Stand With the Peasants:
    Landlord Zhan Yunxiu Helps Annihilate Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
    [Report from our correspondent in Wei County on the 11th] On the night of November 24th, Chiang Kai-shek special agent and habitual bandit Zhan Zhaochun led 18 bandits, secretly sneaking into the home of landlord Zhan Yunxiu in Zhan Village, En County, attempting to assassinate mass leaders at an opportune moment. Bandit Zhan said to Zhan Yunxiu: "We are the same kind of people, don't be afraid." Because the village appropriately took care of the landlords' livelihoods during the emancipation movement, united more than 95% of the peasants, and established peasant dominance, landlord Zhan Yunxiu deeply realized that the Communist Party and the democratic government are good, and that only by standing with the peasants can there be a bright future. The next day at noon, he seized the opportunity to run out and report to our militia headquarters and district office. The militia of more than 50 surrounding villages, upon hearing the news, immediately surrounded Zhan Village. The militia from more than a dozen villages in the first district also rushed to cooperate. The militia rushed into the village and immediately engaged in street fighting with the bandits. Two hours later, the county brigade also arrived to assist in the suppression. Most of the Chiang bandits were annihilated, with only a few escaping.
    Starting with Landlord Zhan Yunxiu
    The fact that Zhan Yunxiu, a landlord of Zhan Village, En County, was able to discern friend from foe at a critical moment and report Chiang Kai-shek special agents and bandits hiding in his home who were attempting to assassinate mass leaders to the democratic government, enabling their annihilation, is a righteous act worthy of emulation by landlords in the liberated areas and is also admired by the people of the liberated areas.
    The Zhan Village incident once again proves that after the implementation of land reform in the liberated areas, not only have peasants been freed from thousands of years of feudal shackles, effectively suppressing traitors and stabilizing social order, but landlords have also been liberated from their decadent parasitic lives and can share the happiness of the New Democratic society. At the same time, this incident provides an example for landlords who have fled to and remain in the Chiang-controlled areas and are suffering from extortion and blackmail by Chiang's army, making life impossible. It also provides a powerful counterattack against Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to use landlords in the liberated areas to carry out sabotage activities. It is well known that under Chiang Kai-shek's dark rule, no one can survive, regardless of who they are. We advise landlords who remain in Chiang-controlled areas to recognize who their "own kind" are, just like Zhan Yunxiu, and understand that only by returning to the liberated areas and standing with the peasants can they find a way out.
    The reason why Zhan Yunxiu was not used by Chiang's special agents is because the village united more than 95% of the peasants, established peasant dominance, and appropriately took care of the landlords' livelihoods during the emancipation movement. This shows that only by thoroughly implementing land reform and fully mobilizing the masses can we prevent Chiang's special agents and saboteurs from using their tricks. Only then can we gain the support of all strata of society, guarantee the development of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, cooperate with the front lines in combat, eliminate Chiang's isolated and reckless troops, and win the victory in the War of Self-Defense.

    坚决和农民站在一起
    地主展云秀助歼蒋匪
    【本报威县十一日电】上月二十四日夜，蒋特惯匪展兆春带领匪徒十八人，秘密潜入恩县展庄地主展云秀家，企图待机暗杀群众领袖。展逆向展云秀说：“咱们是同类人，你不要害怕。”由于该村在翻身运动中适当的照顾了地主生活，团结了百分之九十五以上的农民，建立了农民的优势，地主展云秀深深体会到还是共产党民主政府好，只有跟农民站在一起，才有光明前途，便于次日午后乘隙跑出、报告我民兵队部与区公所。周围五十余村的民兵闻息，即跑步将展庄包围，一区十余村的民兵也迅速赶来配合。民兵冲到村里，即与该匪展开巷战，两点钟后县大队亦赶来助剿，蒋匪大部就歼，仅有少数漏网。
    从地主展云秀说起
    恩县展庄地主展云秀，能在紧急关头，认清敌友，把潜藏自己家中企图暗杀群众领袖的蒋特匪徒向民主政府告密，予以聚歼，这种光明正直行为，足为解放区地主效法，亦为解放区人民所钦佩。
    展庄事件，又一次证明解放区实行土地改革后，不仅农民从此摆脱数千年封建镣铐，有力镇压奸特，安定社会秩序，而且地主亦得以从腐朽的寄生生活中被解救出来，同享新民主主义社会的幸福。同时这一事件，亦给了逃亡滞留蒋管区备受蒋军讹诈勒索无法生活的地主一个榜样，也给蒋介石企图利用解放区地主进行破坏活动一个有力回击。蒋介石的黑暗统治，不论什么人也不能活，已是尽人皆知，我们忠告滞留蒋管区地主们，只有像展云秀一样，认清谁是“同类人”，只有回到解放区和农民站在一起才有出路。
    展云秀之所以没有被蒋特利用，是由于该村团结了百分九十五以上农民，建立了农民优势，而且在翻身运动中适当的照顾了地主生活。由此说明，只有贯彻土地改革彻底发动群众，才能使蒋特破坏分子无所施其伎俩，而我则到处获得各阶层的拥护，保证敌后游击战争的开展，配合正面作战，消灭孤军冒进的蒋军，而取得自卫战争的胜利。
