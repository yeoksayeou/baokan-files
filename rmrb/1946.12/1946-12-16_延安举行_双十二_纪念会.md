　　Yan'an Holds "Double Twelve" Commemorative Meeting
    Passed Resolutions:
    1. Urge Chiang Kai-shek to Immediately Release Generals Zhang and Yang!
    2. Demand the Abolition of the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty and Punishment of Traitors!
    3. Demand that Yasuji Okamura and Other War Criminals Be Handed Over to the People for Public Trial and Severe Punishment!
    4. Thoroughly Eliminate the Chiang-Hu Invading Troops and Strive for the Implementation of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Line and the January Truce Order!

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] The first commemorative meeting in ten years of the "Double Twelve" Incident was held yesterday in the Biancanhui Auditorium here. More than a thousand representatives from all walks of life attended, including foreign guests Colonel Sells and Major Lake of the U.S. Army Observer Group, and British and American journalists Roderick and others. After Vice-Chairman Xie Juezai delivered a speech, Shen Bochun, the former Director of the Political Department of the 17th Route Army who personally experienced the incident, was invited to speak. He revealed the truth about the incident, which had been obscured for ten years by "A Half-Month in Xi'an." The audience responded with scornful jeers at Chiang Kai-shek's crimes, embarrassment, and meanness. Shen concluded by saying, "Today, the people's power has grown unprecedentedly. Chiang Kai-shek still insists on pursuing a policy of national betrayal, dictatorship, and civil war. History will give an impartial judgment!" Vice-Chairman Li Dingming of the Border Region Government, General Zhou Enlai (the full text of General Zhou's speech is in another dispatch), who represented the Chinese Communist Party at the time and worked for a peaceful resolution of the incident, and Mr. Li Furen, the person in charge of the Northwest General Branch of the Democratic League, spoke in succession. Then, General Yang Zhengmin, the son of General Yang Hucheng and current Deputy Commander of the Yanshu Sub-district, took the stage. After recounting the experience of his father being summoned to Nanchang by Chiang Kai-shek via telegram from Hong Kong and then imprisoned, he said indignantly: "My father and General Zhang Xueliang were imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek for resisting Japan, while the top war criminal of the Japanese invaders, Yasuji Okamura, is treated as a distinguished guest. Who but a traitor could do this?!"

    The conference then passed four resolutions, which stated:

    (1) Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng launched the "Double Twelve" Incident, which promoted the united resistance against Japan and contributed to the country and the nation. Chiang Kai-shek violated his promise at the time, arrested and imprisoned them without freedom. We call on the people of the whole country to urge Chiang Kai-shek to immediately release Generals Zhang and Yang!

    (2) The Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty is unprecedentedly traitorous. If the treaty is implemented, China will inevitably perish as a nation and a race. The Chinese people will never recognize it and will never give up until the purpose of abolishing the treaty and punishing the traitors who signed it is achieved!

    (3) More than a year has passed since the Japanese invaders surrendered, but Yasuji Okamura, the chief culprit of the invasion of China, is still treated as a distinguished guest by Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing; and there are plans to use officers to train his troops in order to intensify the slaughter of the Chinese people. The Chinese people should unite and demand that Chiang Kai-shek hand over Yasuji Okamura and other Japanese war criminals protected by Chiang for public trial and severe punishment!

    (4) The conference calls on the military and civilians of the border region to step up the mobilization for the self-defense war, thoroughly eliminate the Chiang-Hu invading troops, and resolutely defend the sacred land of democratic China—the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region; and strive for the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) line and the January truce order!

    After passing the resolutions, the conference shouted slogans such as "Immediately release Generals Zhang and Yang and all patriotic political prisoners!" "Abolish the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty!" "Severely punish Yasuji Okamura!" "Defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia!" and then adjourned.

　　延安举行“双十二”纪念会
    通过决议
    一、督促蒋介石立即释放张杨两将军！
    二、要求废除蒋美商约惩办卖国贼！
    三、要求将冈村宁次等战犯交人民公审严办！
    四、彻底消灭蒋胡进犯军，为实现政协路线与一月停战令而奋斗！                                                  
    【新华社延安十三日电】“双十二”十年来首次纪念会于昨日在此间边参会礼堂举行，到各界代表千余人，并有外宾美军观察组赛尔斯上校、雷克少校及英美记者罗德列克等数人。谢觉哉副议长致词后，即请曾亲历事变之前十七路军政治处长申伯纯先生讲话，他揭露被“西安半月记”蒙蔽了十年的事变真相，对于蒋介石的罪恶、狼狈和卑怯，听众不时报以鄙夷的嗤笑。申氏结语称：“今天人民力量已空前壮大，蒋介石尚仍一意坚持卖国独裁内战政策，历史将予无情裁判！”边府李鼎铭副主席与事变当时代表中共为事变和平解决而奔走的周恩来将军（周将军演词全文见另电）及民盟西北总支部负责人李敷仁先生相继致词后，杨虎城将军之公子现任延属分区副司令员杨拯民将军登台讲话，于陈述其父在香港经蒋介石电召而被囚禁南昌之经过后，愤慨的说：“我父和张学良将军为抗日而被蒋介石囚禁至今，而日寇头等战犯冈村宁次却为其待如上宾，这除了卖国贼外，谁还能做得出呢？！”
    大会至此通过四项决议，略称：
    （一）张学良、杨虎城两将军发动双十二事变，促成团结抗战，有功于国家民族。蒋介石违背当时诺言，加以逮捕禁囚不得自由，我们吁请全国人民督促蒋介石立即释放张杨两将军！
    （二）蒋美商约空前卖国，该约实现则中国必将亡国灭种而后已。中国人民绝不承认，不达废除该约与惩办签订该约的卖国贼之目的誓不罢休！
    （三）日寇投降已逾一年，其侵华首犯冈村宁次，仍在南京被蒋介石待如上宾；并有利用军官训练其军队，以加紧屠杀中国人民的计划，中国人民应一致起来要求蒋介石，将冈村宁次及蒋包庇下的其他日寇战犯交付人民公审严办！
    （四）大会号召边区军民加紧自卫战争动员，彻底消灭蒋胡进犯军，坚决保卫民主中国圣地——陕甘宁边区；为实现政协路线与一月停战命令而奋斗！
    大会通过决议后，高呼：“立即释放张杨二将军及一切爱国政治犯！”“废除蒋美商约！”“严惩冈村宁次！”“保卫陕甘宁！”等口号，散会。
