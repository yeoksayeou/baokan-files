　　Xia Ensha District Experience:
　　Women Together Overturn Their Fate in Mass Movements
　　Gaining Peasant Sympathy by Not Making Overly High Demands
　　Examples of Harmonious Relations Between Mothers-in-Law and Daughters-in-Law
　　[Report from our Wei County Office, 19th] In the peasant emancipation movement in the Xia Ensha District of Southern Hebei, women's liberation was also achieved simultaneously. A summary of their experiences is reported as follows: In the early stages of the peasant movement, three situations existed in this district: (1) In villages with peasant liaison organizations, individual aggrieved women were brought together and acted along with the peasants. (2) In villages that had undergone the hired and tenant peasant movement, general literacy classes for women were established, but women did not participate in the peasant movement. (3) In villages where peasants had already mobilized, women's groups were established in the peasant associations, but they were limited to aggrieved women and poor daughters-in-law. The above three situations show that the district did not lead and support women in the early stages of the peasant movement. Since the slogan "Women should take revenge on landlords and local tyrants together" was put forward in the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement, some aggrieved women in the first district of En County were first brought together and organized into women's groups in about a dozen villages to carry out struggles together with the peasants. When the women of Beizhan struggled against the landlord and tyrant Xu Zhenqing, they also directly participated in grievance-airing and shouting slogans. This proves that under the bloody rule of landlords and local tyrants, the demands of women and peasants are consistent, and women are most easily mobilized and organized in the struggle. Women and peasants jointly overthrow feudal oppression. However, overly high slogans should not be put forward, which will lose the sympathy of the broad masses of peasants. Before the women of Zhouquanzhuang took actual action, they put forward the overly high slogan "Women should arm themselves!", which caused most peasants to prevent their wives and sisters from participating in the women's liberation association. Bad elements also took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying, "The relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law is reversed." "Women are about to go to heaven, it's terrible." As a result, the organization collapsed. At the end of the peasant emancipation movement in the first district of En County, only the slogans "Mothers-in-law should take care of clothing, and daughters-in-law should produce more." "Families should be harmonious and live a good life together." were put forward, which won the sympathy of all the peasants in the district, who supported women to participate in the women's association. When it was cold, mothers-in-law took out cotton early and gave it to their daughters-in-law to spin and weave, so that they would no longer have to go back to their parents' homes to ask for it. The daughters-in-law were also particularly filial, getting up early to cook and helping the men with work during the day, and spinning and weaving at night. The phenomenon of "quarrels between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law" and "secret accusations" was eliminated in every village. This made it very easy for young women to participate in women's organizations, work hard to produce, and seek their own complete liberation. In the Xia En area, two-thirds of the villages and seventy percent of the women have been organized. Anti-abuse is an internal problem of the peasants, and it should be resolved through mediation, not struggle. However, for individual cases that are outrageous and hated by the majority of peasants, and after repeated women's education and persuasion, but the problem persists, it can be resolved through struggle with the sympathy of the majority of peasants, but beatings and punishments should also be avoided. Wang Taitang of Beizhan forced his daughter-in-law and son to separate and live away from home for four or five years. After the persuasion of forty or fifty women, there was still no result, which aroused the indignation of the whole village. In this case, the women launched a reasoned struggle against him, and then conducted mediation. Now the whole family is reunited, and Wang Taitang has also repented. As for the problems between sisters-in-law, sisters-in-law, and neighbors, if they are all women members, they can conduct "knot-untangling" through "thinking meetings" to unite all the women in the family and move towards the unity of the whole village.

### 夏恩沙区经验：  群运中妇女一同翻身

　　夏恩沙区经验：
    群运中妇女一同翻身
    不提过高要求取得农民同情
    婆媳走向和睦的范例
    【本报威县十九日电】冀南夏恩沙区在农民翻身运动中，同时争得妇女的解放，综合她们的经验报导如下：当农民运动的初期，该区存在着三种情况：（一）在农民串连组织的村庄，个别的妇女苦主被串连起来，随着农民一起行动。（二）凡是经过雇佃贫运动的村庄，一般的都建立了妇女识字班，但妇女并未参加农民运动。（三）在农民已动起来的村庄，农会里建立了妇女小组，但仅限于苦主与贫苦媳妇。以上三种情况，表明该区在农民运动初期，是没有把妇女带领与扶持起来。自反奸诉苦运动提出：“妇女一齐向地主豪绅复仇”的口号，首先在恩县一区有些妇女苦主串连，并组织起来了十来个村的妇女群众，和农民一块进行斗争，北站妇女在农民斗争地主恶霸徐振清时，妇女亦直接参加诉苦，喊口号。由此证明，在地主豪绅血腥统治下，妇女与农民的要求是一致的，在斗争中，亦最易把妇女发动与组织起来，妇女与农民共同推翻封建压迫。但不可提出过高之口号，失掉广大农民的同情。周全庄的妇女在本身未实际行动前，就过高的提出了：“妇女武装起来！”的口号，致使大多数的农民阻止自己的老婆姐妹参加妇女解放会，坏分子也趁机造谣说：“婆媳倒过来了。”“女的快上天哪，可不得了。”结果组织垮台。恩县一区在农民翻身运动末期只提出了：“婆婆要管穿，媳妇要多生产。”“家庭和睦，一起过好日子。”的口号，结果博得全区农民的同情，都赞助妇女参加妇女会。天冷了当婆婆的早早拿出棉花来交给媳妇去纺织，不令其再上娘家去要，当媳妇的也特别孝敬，早起做饭，白天帮着汉们干活，夜晚纺花织布，村村消灭了“婆媳争吵”，“暗地告讼”的现象。这样就使得青年妇女很顺利的参加到妇女组织里，努力生产，求得自己的彻底解放。在夏恩地区，就有三分之二的村庄，百分之七十的妇女，被组织起来。妇女反虐待是农民的内部问题，在处理上应是调解，不是斗争方式。但对个别伤天害理，为大多数农民所痛恨的，屡经妇女教育，解劝不改，在大多数农民的同情下，可采取斗争形式解决，但亦力避打罚。北站王泰棠家威逼着儿媳夫妇分居，流离在外四五年，经妇女四五十人的解劝，仍无结果，激起了全村的义愤，在这种情况下，妇女向其开展了说理斗争，随后又进行了调解，现在全家团圆，王泰棠家也悔过自新。至于妯娌与姑嫂及邻居间的问题，如都系妇女会员，可通过“想想会”进行“解疙瘩”，使全家妇女团结，走向全村团结一致。
