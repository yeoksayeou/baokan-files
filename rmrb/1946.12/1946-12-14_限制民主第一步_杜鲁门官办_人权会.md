    The First Step in Restricting Democracy
    Truman's Government-Run "Human Rights Commission"
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 10th: According to a U.S. news agency report on the 6th, U.S. President Truman recently appointed a human rights commission headed by Mellon, the manager of General Electric. In explaining the establishment of this commission, Truman stated, "The government is sometimes hindered in performing its duties by the status of citizens' rights, so this commission is established to study changes." Some observers in Washington believe that this move may be a prelude to the Truman administration's plan to restrict the democratic rights of the American people.
