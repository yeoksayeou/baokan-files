[Via this newspaper's correspondent in Weixian, 16th] Our Yongnian County government, in promoting the land reform movement, has issued a proclamation stating that for farmers fleeing from the Jiang area, in addition to receiving land like ordinary poor people, their allocation of struggle materials will be specially increased by one level. It also welcomes people in the city under the rule of the traitor "Grindstone" to come out and receive land. Regardless of wealth or poverty, they will be treated the same as refugees. Former puppet soldiers who have reformed will also receive land. We also welcome puppet soldiers to defect and will allocate them land upon their return. The proclamation also stated: those who violate land reform and obstruct the people's struggle to overturn their lives will be severely punished without leniency.

　　永年订出优待办法欢迎城里农民出来翻身
    【本报威县十六日电】我永年县府在推行土地改革运动时，特发布布告指出，对于自蒋区逃来之农民，除与一般贫民同样分地外，分斗争物资时特别提高一级，并欢迎城里在铁逆“磨头”统治下的人民出来分地，不论贫富，均照难民同样优待。业经改过伪军，同样分得土地。并欢迎伪军反正，回来后一样分得土地。布告中并称：若有违犯土地改革，阻碍群众翻身者，定予严惩，决不姑息。
