    Universally Launch the Wang Keqin Movement
    *Liberation Daily* Editorial, December 10th
    Two months ago, in an editorial, we called for "doing a good job of prisoner-of-war work," emphasizing the importance of this work. Now, the Wang Keqin movement launched by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army not only vividly confirms the correctness of this call, but also further develops it in content.

    Who is Wang Keqin? He was captured and forced into the Kuomintang army at a young age, enduring oppression and abuse, living a dark and miserable life for six years. After being captured, he recognized the benefits of the People's Army and resolved to join the Eighth Route Army. After the "speaking bitterness" campaign and seeing that the peasants in the liberated areas had obtained land and were living free and prosperous lives, he realized that he should fight to the end for the liberation of the Chinese people, so that his "hometown could also allow the poor to turn over." Therefore, he fought resolutely and bravely, wholeheartedly using his life experience and technical knowledge learned in the Chiang army to help new soldiers improve, and led them in combat, so that the soldiers felt that "fighting with him, they were not afraid of danger and felt very confident." As a result, the class he led became a model class. He himself became a model combat hero, established many military exploits, and was praised by the vast number of soldiers and people. In this way, Comrade Wang Keqin created a new glorious example for the cause of Chinese People's Liberation. He transformed from an ignorant slave under Chiang Kai-shek to a people's soldier with wisdom, benevolence, and courage, combined with the broad masses of the people. He accepted the fine traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, highly promoted class friendship, mutual assistance and mutual learning, consolidated the unity of officers and soldiers and the unity of the army and the people, strengthened combat effectiveness, and more effectively eliminated the enemy. It is of extremely great significance that the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu troops are now widely launching the Wang Keqin movement to further improve the combat effectiveness of the troops and disintegrate the enemy. We hope that the soldiers and civilians of the entire liberated area can follow their current conditions and choose their own typical examples to universally and forcefully promote this movement.

    The primary task of launching the Wang Keqin movement is to universally and enthusiastically promote mutual assistance and mutual learning in our entire People's Liberation Army, improve technology, and improve combat effectiveness. We should admit that the Chiang army officers and soldiers who have laid down their weapons are generally trained in combat skills. Therefore, the new soldiers in our troops, and even the commanders, should humbly learn from them and absorb their experience to help improve their own skills; and further understand the internal situation of the Chiang army from them, to better achieve "know yourself and know your enemy" and seek victory in every battle. Those Chiang army officers and soldiers who have laid down their arms and are determined to participate in the patriotic self-defense war should also learn from Comrade Wang Keqin's example, and use the methods of "teaching while demonstrating" and educating in actual work and combat to teach their experience and technology to other comrades. Comrade Wang Keqin said: "To be able to fight well, we must first teach new soldiers well. Teach more in peacetime, and it will save effort in wartime." This is completely correct. And they themselves should constantly strengthen their political study, clearly recognize their goals, which is to oppose the aggression of American imperialism and the traitorous and dictatorial rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, establish an independent, peaceful and democratic New China, and resolve to fight to the end to achieve such goals. Recognize that land reform is the basic key to turning the Chinese people over, and be willing to shed the last drop of blood to defend the fruits of the people's liberation. In this regard, the political workers and veteran soldiers of our troops should provide particularly more help, and any attitude of slighting or indifference towards them is incorrect.

    Another aspect of the Wang Keqin movement is to emphasize the unity of new and old soldiers in our troops, and to emphasize the unity of soldiers from peasant backgrounds and soldiers from the old army. All soldiers should have a deeper understanding of the truth that unity can overcome everything. They should better help each other, care for each other, learn from each other, and supervise each other in politics, life, work, and combat, greatly promote the role of mutual aid groups in the troops, and be like the class led by Wang Keqin: "Comrades are all affectionate, and everyone strives to do public errands and services, which is even better than at home." In front of such a People's Army that is as united as steel, it can be asserted that any enemy's attack will only be thoroughly and decisively crushed.

    Finally, in carrying out the Wang Keqin movement, we must strengthen the work of disintegrating the enemy army. After more than five months of strong resistance from the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas, Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis has indeed arrived, and the morale of the Chiang army has become even lower. If it is said that more than 100,000 Chiang army soldiers have laid down their weapons and staged uprisings in the five months of combat, then in the future, this situation will definitely be more frequent and more widespread. Therefore, we must use Wang Keqin's vivid examples to widely publicize to the Chiang army, telling them not to sacrifice their lives for American aggressors and Chiang Kai-shek's traitors, and send good comrades like Wang Keqin who have come from the Chiang army to the front line to shout and persuade them. Use their mouths as weapons, and use empathetic and reasonable personal experiences to persuade the Chiang army soldiers on the other side, urging them to change their minds, engage in passive resistance, strikes, and uprisings, drag their guns over, return to their hometowns, or join the People's Liberation Army to become glorious People's soldiers like Wang Keqin. This method is very useful for disintegrating the enemy army. Recently, there have been many such examples. For example, in the Dayang Lake battle in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, Zheng Yujing, a soldier who had just been captured from the 59th Regiment of the 20th Brigade of the 3rd Division of the Chiang army and joined the Eighth Route Army for only two days, used his shouts to persuade two Chiang army soldiers to bring their guns and surrender to our army. In the Fenyangling battle in Jin-Sui, Lu Erxiao, a soldier who had defected from Yan Xishan's army, used his shouts on the front line to persuade twelve Yan Xishan's soldiers to lay down their weapons. We should greatly promote similar experiences, better carry out the work of disintegrating the enemy army, and further strengthen our ranks to finally crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive.

    普遍开展王克勤运动
    解放日报十日社论
    两个月前我们曾在一篇社论中号召“好好进行俘虏工作”，着重说明这一工作的重要性。现在晋冀鲁豫人民解放军所开展的王克勤运动，不但生动的证实了这一号召的正确，在内容上也使它更加发展了。
    王克勤是怎样的一个人呢？他很早就被抓到国民党军队里去当兵，受尽压迫虐待，过了六年黑暗悲惨的生活。被俘后他认识了人民军队的好处，下定决心参加八路军；经过诉苦运动，再看到解放区的农民都得到了土地，过着自由和丰衣足食的生活，他就觉悟到应该为中国人民的解放而奋斗到底，使他的“家乡也能让穷人翻身”。于是他坚决勇敢的作战，尽心竭力的用他在蒋军中的生活体验和学到的技术知识帮助新战士进步，并带领他们作战，使战士们都感觉到“跟着他打仗，不怕危险，心里怪有主张”；因此他所带领的那一个班，就成了模范班。他自己成为模范的战斗英雄，建立了很多战功，受到广大战士和人民的赞扬。这样，王克勤同志就为中国人民解放事业创造了新的光荣的范例。他从一个蒋介石手下的愚昧的奴隶，转而与广大人民相结合，很快的变成一员智仁勇全备的人民战士，他接受了中国人民解放军的优良传统，高度发扬阶级友爱，互助互学，巩固官兵团结与军民团结，加强战斗力，更有效的消灭敌人。晋冀鲁豫部队现在广泛开展王克勤运动，借以进一步提高部队的战斗力与瓦解敌人，是有极其重大的意义的。我们希望全解放区的军民，都能按照当前自己的条件选择自己的典型来普遍有力的推行这个运动。
    开展王克勤运动的首要任务，是在我全体人民解放军中普遍热烈的提倡互助互学，提高技术与提高战斗力。我们应该承认放下武器的蒋军官兵，在作战技术上一般的是经过训练的，因此我们部队中的新生战士，甚至指挥员，应该虚心向他们学习，吸取他们的经验，以为提高自己的技术之助；并进一步从他们那里了解蒋军内部的情况，更好的做到“知己知彼”求得百战百胜。那些已经放下武装决心参加爱国自卫战争的蒋军官兵们，也应该学王克勤同志的榜样，用“边教边比画”和在实际工作与战斗中教育的方法，将自己的经验技术教给别的同志。王克勤同志说：“要能打好仗，首先要教好新战士，平时多教，战时就省力”。这是完全正确的。而他们自己又应当时时刻刻加强政治学习，明确认清自己奋斗的目标，就在反对美帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石反动集团的卖国独裁统治，建立独立和平民主的新中国，并决心为达到这样的目标坚决奋斗到底。认识土地改革是使中国人民翻身的基本关键，并愿为保卫人民翻身的果实而流最后一滴血。在这一方面，我们部队的政治工作人员和老战士，应加以特别多的帮助，对于他们的任何轻视与漠不关心的态度都是不正确的。
    展开王克勤运动的另一个内容，就是强调我们部队中新老战士的团结，强调翻身农民出身与旧军队出身战士的团结，应该让全体战士更深刻的了解团结就能战胜一切的真理。他们在政治上、生活上、工作中、战斗中应该更好的相互帮助，相互体贴，相互学习，相互督促，大大发扬部队中互助组的作用，做到像王克勤所带领的那个班一样：“同志们都亲亲热热，公差勤务大家争着干，比家里还好”。在这样团结得像钢铁似的人民军队前面，任何敌人的进攻，除了遭到彻底干脆的粉碎以外，再不能有别的结果，是可以断言的。
    最后，开展王克勤运动，我们要加强瓦解敌军的工作。经过五个多月解放区军民的坚强抵抗，蒋介石的军事危机已经确切地到来了，蒋军的士气已经更加低落了。假如说作战五个月来蒋军已有十多万人放下武器和举行起义，那么在今后，这种情形一定会更多和更加普遍。因此我们要用王克勤一样的生动典型，广泛的向蒋军宣传，要他们再不要为美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国贼卖命，要派出像王克勤一样从蒋军方面过来的好同志到火线上去喊话。用嘴巴当作武器，入情入理的现身说法，给对方的蒋军士兵听，要他们回心转意，实行怠战罢战和起义，拖枪过来，解甲还乡，或参加人民解放军做王克勤一般光荣的人民战士。这个办法对瓦解敌军是十分有用的，最近就有不少这样的例子，如在晋冀鲁豫大阳湖战役中，一个刚从蒋军整三师二十旅五十九团被俘过来参加八路军不过两天的战士郑玉经，就用喊话争取了两个蒋军士兵携枪投到我军来。在晋绥汾阳岭战斗中，一个从阎军方面反正过来的战士卢二小，用火线喊话争取到十二名阎军放下武器。我们应该大大发扬这类似的经验，更好的进行瓦解敌军的工作，以更加壮大我们的队伍，最后粉碎蒋介石的进攻。
