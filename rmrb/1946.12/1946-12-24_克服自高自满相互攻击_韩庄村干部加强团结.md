　　Overcoming Arrogance and Mutual Attacks
    Hanzhuang Village Cadres Strengthen Unity
    [This newspaper's Weixian news] In the middle of last month, the masses in various villages in the Fourth District of Jixian County launched a vigorous struggle against traitors and for revenge. Only Hanzhuang Village was lifeless. The Fourth District Chief talked to many people to investigate the reasons and learned that the village cadres in the village had serious hero worship, did not obey each other, and cadres took over everything without discussing it with the masses. In particular, the fruits of the spring democratic struggle were largely pocketed by the village cadres, and they were dissatisfied with each other because of uneven distribution, undermining each other's prestige among the masses. For example, the village chief, Han Xiyuan, said to the masses: "The director of the Farmers' Association is not leading well!" Zheng Jindong, the director of the Farmers' Association, said to the masses: "The village chief is not qualified!" The militia instructor, Han Changfu, and the organization minister of the Farmers' Association, Han Hongzhou, also had disagreements. The work in the village was carried out independently, but it was met with dissatisfaction from the masses. After the district chief understood the situation, he first talked to people who were close to the village cadres individually, explaining the harm of disunity. After persuading individual village cadres, he convened a meeting of village cadres to conduct class education, explaining the suffering each family had experienced in the past and the source of today's political and economic status, moving everyone to tears. When talking about the harm of selfishness, self-interest, and hero worship, it was explained in more detail, opening up the thinking of each cadre. After that, at a mass meeting, each cadre made a painful reflection and immediately took out the embezzled property, which was rationally distributed after discussion by the masses. The militia captain and the director of the Farmers' Association voluntarily gave up their share of the struggle fruits, which pleased the masses, who said: "In recent years, the village cadres have not promoted democracy, but today they have changed and become our good leaders."

　　克服自高自满相互攻击
    韩庄村干部加强团结
    【本报威县讯】上月中旬，冀县四区各村群众都轰轰烈烈掀起反奸复仇斗争，惟独韩村死气沉沉。四区区长便和许多群众谈话，调查原因，了解该村村干都有严重的英雄主义，互相不服，遇事干部包办，不经群众讨论。特别是春季民主斗争的果实，村干大部入了私囊，并因分不均彼此不满，在群众中互相破坏威信。如村长韩西元向群众说：“农会主任领导不好！”农会主任郑金栋对群众说：“村长不够资格！”民兵指导员韩长孚和农会组织部长韩洪洲也闹意见。村中工作各自为政，但都遭到群众不满。区长了解情况后，首先找和村干知己的人，个别谈话，说明不团结的害处，说服个别村干后，又召集村干会，进行阶级教育，说明每个人的家庭以前所受的痛苦，和今天政治、经济地位的来源，感动的每个人都难过流泪。当说到自私自利和英雄主义对自己的危害，更为详尽，打通了每个干部的思想。此后，在群众会上每个干部都痛心的作了反省，并将私吞的财物立刻拿出来，经群众讨论合理分配。民兵队长、农会主任并自愿不分斗争果实，喜得群众都说：“这些年来村干部们没有发扬民主，今天都改变了，就成我们的好领导人了。”
