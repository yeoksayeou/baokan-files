　　Linfen Third District Reviews American-Equipped Militia
    Qiao Ligong, Chen Faxian, and Others Elected as Enemy-Killing Heroes
    Zhao City Military Committee Calls for Dispersed Guerrilla Warfare and Development of Explosives
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 23rd dispatch] The Linfen Third District's "American-equipped militia" held a grand review on the 10th of this month and elected Qiao Ligong, Chen Faxian, and twenty-two other enemy-killing heroes. Over the course of three months (September to November), the district's militia engaged in 78 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 82 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops, and seizing from the American-equipped Chiang army one American-made infantry gun, seven machine guns, four Sten submachine guns, fifty-nine Chiang Kai-shek type rifles, eight pistols, one telescope, 38,500 rounds of ammunition, fifteen livestock, and 265 catties of wire.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 21st dispatch] Since Ling Shi captured Wu Daolong, the head of the revenge squad alive, the masses' fighting spirit has been rising, with militia and gunfire everywhere. In just eight days, from the 7th to the 15th of this month, the militia fought the enemy sixteen times, killing sixty-four Yan Xishan puppet troops and seizing one machine gun and five rifles.
    [This newspaper dispatch] Dispersed guerrilla warfare and the development of explosives were the new strategies proposed by the Zhao City Military Committee on November 10th when summarizing a month of fighting against the enemy. After the enemy invaded and occupied Zhao City on October 9th, the people of the county rose up in self-defense, and in one month, they fought fifty-two battles, killing and wounding 51 enemy soldiers from the 181st Regiment of the 61st Brigade of the 90th Division, including the regiment leader Ling Mou and "comfort group" Major Committee Member Deng Baisheng. They also captured 73 enemy soldiers from the 90th Division headquarters, including a deputy adjutant and an engineer platoon leader. The summary pointed out that guerrilla warfare was not yet widespread enough because of the excessively centralized approach, satisfying the organizational form of concentrated rotational combat teams, and transferring all the village militia and armed forces to the rotational combat teams, resulting in the loss of armed forces in vast villages and the inability to inflict greater casualties on the enemy. Secondly, the development of explosives had not been carried out well, mainly because the leadership had not paid enough attention to it in the previous period. It was decided to reduce the size of the rotational combat teams, strengthen the joint defense groups in small war zones, strengthen dispersed guerrilla activities, and set up a flying explosive group within the rotational combat team to specialize in actively bombing the enemy. Three base points were determined, led personally by the County Military Committee, to carry out a two-week explosive assault competition, and then promote it.

　　临汾三区检阅美械民兵
    乔立功陈发贤等当选杀敌英雄
    赵城武委会号召分散游击发展爆炸
    【本报太岳二十三日电】临汾三区“美械化民兵”，于本月十日举行大检阅，选出乔立功，陈发贤等二十四位杀敌英雄。该区民兵三个月（九月至十一月）来作战七十八次，毙伤俘蒋伪军八十二名，从美械蒋军手中缴获美造步兵炮一门、机枪七挺、斯登手提式四挺、中正式步枪五十九枝、手枪八枝、望远镜一个、子弹三万八千五百发、牲口十五匹、电线二百六十五斤。
    【本报太岳二十一日电】灵石自活捉复仇团团长吴道龙后，群众斗争情绪愈益高涨，到处有民兵，到处有枪声。仅本月七日至十五日八天内，民兵与敌作战十六次，击毙阎伪军六十四名，缴获机枪一挺、步枪五枝。
    【本报讯】分散游击，发展爆炸，为赵城武委会于十一月十日总结一月对敌斗争时提出的新方针。敌于十月九日侵陷赵城后，该县人民即奋起自卫，一月来计作战五十二次，毙伤敌九十师六十一旅一八一团团长岭某及“慰问组”少校委员邓柏生以下五十一名，俘敌九十师师部副官及工兵排长以下七十三名。总结中指出：游击战争还不够普遍，原因是采取了过分集中的方针，满足于轮战队集中打仗的组织形式，把各村民兵、武装统统调到轮战队，致广大村庄失掉武装，不能予敌以更大杀伤。其次，爆炸没有很好展开，主要原因是前一时期领导上注意不够。当决定：缩小轮战队，加强小战区的联防集团，加强分散的游击活动，并在轮战队内设飞引爆炸组，专门主动炸敌。并确定三个基点，由县武委会亲自领导，开展两周爆炸突击竞赛，然后推广开来。
