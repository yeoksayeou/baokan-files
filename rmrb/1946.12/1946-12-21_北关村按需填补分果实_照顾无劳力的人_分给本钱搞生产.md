　　【Report from Shexian by Our Newspaper】 Beiguan Village in the Ninth District of this county recently adopted the following methods for distributing the fruits of struggle during the rent reduction campaign. The principle is: "Fill the gaps for the extremely poor, supplement the poor peasants, and take care of the middle peasants." The village has 19 extremely poor households, 28 poor peasant households, and 82 middle peasant households, which are divided into grades based on the actual situation of the family. The extremely poor are divided into three grades, the poor peasants into three grades, and the middle peasants into two grades, and appropriate distribution is carried out. 1. Land distribution: (1) For the extremely poor, veterans, and families of revolutionary soldiers with one person in the household, one mu of paddy field and two mu of dry land are distributed. For households with two or more people, each person receives 2.5 mu. Poor peasants are supplemented to two mu per person. For example, Tian Yuzhong, a poor peasant with one person, was allocated more than three mu of land. (2) For middle peasants with less land, the rent for leased land is reduced by half, or the land tax is fixed at a 4-6 split. For those with more self-cultivated land, they are compensated with public land according to the original rent. (3) Poor revolutionary soldier families are upgraded by one grade. Zhao Yunting, a revolutionary soldier family who was a poor peasant, was raised one level to the second grade, first level. (4) The extremely poor and those with weak labor power are allocated land that is nearby or of good quality, while poor and middle peasants with strong labor power are allocated land that is far away or of poor quality. (5) Two elderly, orphaned men among the poor peasants who sell food on the street and cannot cultivate the land due to lack of labor power are given some capital to help them develop production. 2. Other property and money are distributed universally. Houses are allocated to households without housing. Other materials are distributed according to the needs of the masses, from the extremely poor to the poor peasants to the middle peasants. For example, if the extremely poor have land, they are appropriately supplemented with farm tools and grain.

　　北关村按需填补分果实
    照顾无劳力的人
    分给本钱搞生产
    【本报涉县讯】本县九区北关最近在查减中分配斗争果实办法如下：原则是：“赤贫填平，贫农补齐，中农照顾。”该村亦贫十九户，贫农二十八户，中农八十二户，以家庭实际情况划分等级。亦贫三等，贫农三等，中农分为两等，进行适当的分配。一、土地分配：（一）赤贫、荣退、抗属，一户一口者分到一亩水地，二亩旱地。一户两口以上者，每人分到二亩五分。贫农每人以二亩补足。如田玉中一口人是个贫农，就分了三亩多地。（二）中农自耕地较少者，租典地税一半或四六税死契，自耕地较多者，便照原租地补租给公地。（三）贫苦抗属提高一等。抗属赵云亭是贫农，便高一级，提到二等一级。（四）赤贫及劳力弱者分近地或好地，贫农中农劳力强者便分远地坏地。（五）贫农里有两个孤绝老汉在街头卖饭，没劳力种不了地，便分给他一部分本钱，帮助他发展生产。二、其他财物，钱普遍分，房子以没房子住的户分，其他物资等按群众需要，光由赤贫到贫农中农来分配。如赤贫有了土地便适当的补足他农具，粮食。
