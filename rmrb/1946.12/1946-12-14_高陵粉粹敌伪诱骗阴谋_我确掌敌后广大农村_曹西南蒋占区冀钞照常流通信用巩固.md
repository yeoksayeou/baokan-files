    Gaoling Smashes Enemy and Puppet Enticement Plot
    We Firmly Control the Vast Rural Areas Behind Enemy Lines
    Jicha Currency Circulates Normally and Credit is Consolidated in the Southwestern Jiang Occupied Area of Cao County
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Jilu Yu, 8th] In the past two months, the conspiracy of Jiang and his puppets to entice our Gaoling militiamen to surrender and organize the Society Gate riots has been completely smashed. We have persisted in the vast rural areas and gained the following experience in the struggle: (1) Cadres combined with militiamen to conduct search and suppression. Wang Gengxin, a landlord of Laodi Village in the First District, returned with the puppet army and was arrested by us. We uncovered several cases of puppet army elements attempting to entice militiamen to surrender, saving more than 50 militiamen. In the suppression, six members of the "Returning Home Team" and several similar incidents were uncovered. (2) Purge bad elements in the militia and quickly and decisively confiscate the guns of unreliable elements; as soon as the Second District confiscated the guns of Dongzhao, Zhao Fuju, a puppet, sent people to get the guns but failed; the guns of Caolizhuang in the Fourth District were taken away by the enemy because they were not resolutely confiscated. (3) When the stubborn puppets conspired to defect to the enemy and organize Society Gates, we must control the targets of struggle, detain a very small number of local bullies, and educate the general landlords and those who have been liquidated by the masses, forbidding them from demanding the land or the fruits of the struggle from the masses again, and calling on them to jointly oppose the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. At that time, a meeting of landlords and gentry was held, the county government posted a notice, and announced the protection of their human rights and property rights. This work should be combined with the militia's guerrilla warfare and become a unified short-term assault work of the Party, government, army and people, which has achieved great results, because the stubborn puppets organize riots when the enemy invades, so we should strike hard to smash it.
    [This newspaper reports] In the Jiang army-occupied areas of Heze, Qibin, Dongming, and Kaocheng in southwestern Cao County, the vast rural areas are still in our hands. The banknotes of the Luxi and Jinnan Banks are still circulating and used normally, and their credit is still very consolidated. Although the Jiang army distributed a large amount of legal tender, the vast majority of the masses refused to use it except for a few Jiang army strongholds. Even if they had to accept it, they could not use it and would never keep it. As a result of the Jiang army's unlimited issuance of legal tender, prices in the Jiang-controlled areas are rising day by day, five or six times higher than those in the liberated areas; therefore, although the Jiang regime has repeatedly ordered the prohibition of Jicha currency circulation, it has no effect. The Jiang army had no choice but to try to suppress the Jicha currency by lowering the price. At first, it stipulated that one yuan of legal tender was equivalent to five yuan of Jicha currency, but no one went to exchange it at all. Later, it was changed to one yuan of legal tender for two yuan of Jicha currency, but it was still useless. In fact, one yuan of Jicha currency was still worth three to four yuan of legal tender. Even in cities such as Heze and Cao County, the masses still tried their best to save Jicha currency and did not use legal tender. On the black market, each yuan of Jicha currency was still worth more than three yuan of legal tender. The Jiang army's conspiracy to suppress Jicha currency completely failed. (Ximin)

    高陵粉粹敌伪诱骗阴谋
    我确掌敌后广大农村
    曹西南蒋占区冀钞照常流通信用巩固
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】两个月来，蒋伪企图诱我高陵民兵投降及组织会门暴动的阴谋，完全被粉碎，我坚持了广大农村阵地，斗争中获得经验如下：（一）干部结合民兵进行搜剿，一区老堤村地主王更新随伪还乡，为我逮捕，破获伪军分子企图诱骗民兵投降案数起，挽救了五十多个民兵。在清剿中破获“还乡队”六人及此类事件数起。（二）清洗民兵中的坏分子，迅速坚决收了不可靠分子的枪；二区刚收了东赵的枪，伪赵福九派人来弄枪时落了空；四区曹李庄的枪，因没有坚决收，以致被敌收去一部。（三）在顽伪阴谋活动投敌、组织会门时，我们要控制斗争对象，将极少数恶霸分子扣押起来，对一般的地主及曾被群众清算过的人，则进行教育，不许再要群众的土地或斗争果实，号召他们共同反对卖国贼蒋介石。当时曾开了地主士绅会，县府贴了布告，并宣布保障他们的人权、财权。这些工作，应与民兵打游击结合起来，成为党政军民武统一的短期突击工作，收效很大，因顽伪组织暴动也是在敌人进犯时来一阵，应突击粉碎它。
    【本报讯】在曹西南荷泽、齐滨、东明、考城等蒋军侵占区内，广大农村仍在我手，鲁西、冀南两银行钞票，照常流通使用，信用仍极巩固。蒋军虽大量散发法币，但除少数蒋军据点外，广大群众都拒绝使用，即使不得已收下后，也都马上没法用出去，绝不保留。由于蒋军无限制滥发法币的结果，蒋管区物价日益高涨，较解放区物价高达五六倍之多；所以，蒋政权虽一再下令禁止冀钞流通，毫无效果。蒋军无法乃企图以贬低价格的办法，来排压冀钞，始则规定一元法币折合冀钞五元，但根本无人去兑换，以后又改为法币一元兑换冀钞两元，仍然没有用，实际上，一元冀钞仍值法币三元至四元不等。甚至，在荷泽、曹县等城内，群众依然竭力保存冀钞，不用法币，黑市上，每元冀钞仍值法币三元多。蒋军排压冀钞的阴谋完全失败。（西民）
