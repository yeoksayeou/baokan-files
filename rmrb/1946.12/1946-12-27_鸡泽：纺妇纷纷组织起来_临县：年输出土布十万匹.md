　　【This Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Wei County, 23rd】The folk textile industry in Jize is flourishing increasingly under the call to launch winter production. The women spinners are making substantial profits; every family is warmly clothed and well-fed, and their lives have improved. In the Fengguanying area of the First District, and surrounding twenty-plus villages, textile groups have sprung up in every village under the leadership of textile hero Song Ai, and the sound of looms can be heard everywhere. In Fengguanying and Wuguanying villages alone, there are forty-one textile groups. Although the autumn harvest and tax reduction have taken up much time in the past month, they are still able to weave 753 bolts of cloth (excluding cloth woven for personal use), earning a net profit of 5,662 catties of cotton. People in this area, which is not a cotton-producing region, are all wearing new cotton clothes this year, and the women are wearing printed cloth. Song Ai's group includes a widowed old woman who relies on spinning for a living; this year, she made herself a set of cotton clothes and also sold wheat, sorghum, and other grains. In Wuguanying, Cheng Niang's family relies on spinning to cover all household expenses except for food. The spinning women are all vying to buy spinning wheels and spinning machines. The Wuguanying textile group recently added seven looms and two spinning wheels, bringing the total to forty-seven looms and one hundred and seventy-eight spinning wheels. In the old Chengying village, the trial production of new-style foot-operated spinning machines has been successful, and the first machine has already begun spinning thread, while the second machine is being rushed into production. Textile hero Song Ai said: "With the new machines, the women can do more work and also have time to study." (Note: Jize was not a cotton-producing area before.)
　　
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, 22nd】The textile industry in Lin County is gradually developing towards enterprise. In addition to solving the clothing needs of the county's 240,000 people, the county's family textiles have exported more than 100,000 bolts of homespun cloth this year. Of the county's 120,000 women, 81,657 are engaged in spinning, with 42,445 spinning wheels and 3,273 looms. Spinning and weaving are now done in every household. After the new cotton harvest this year, the county's women spinners plan to complete 70,000 bolts of standard cloth by the end of the lunar year. In recent years, small weaving factories jointly operated by the masses along the Dachuan villages have developed considerably. In Sanchao town, the county has more than 1,600 cotton yarns on the market every day to supply the needs of various weaving factories. Women sell pure yarn, exchange it for cotton and then spin again. Some villages or individuals weave cloth independently, exchanging cloth for yarn.

　　鸡泽：纺妇纷纷组织起来
    临县：年输出土布十万匹
    【本报威县二十三日电】鸡泽的民间纺织业，在开展冬季生产的号召下，已日趋繁荣。纺妇们盈利巨大，家家衣暖食饱，生活改善。一区逢官营一带二十多个村，在纺织英雄宋爱的领导下，纺织组遍及各村，机杼声到人可闻。仅逢官营、吴官营两村，即有纺织组四十一个，月来虽秋收查减占去了很多时间，但仍能织布七百五十三匹（自穿布在外），赚净棉五千六百六十二斤。这块不是棉产区的人们，今年都穿上了新棉衣，妇女们都穿上了花布。宋爱的组一寡妇老婆，靠纺织生活，今年做了一身棉衣，还粜下麦子、高粮等粮食。吴官营成娘家除食粮外，一切家用赖纺织开支。纺娘们都争着购买纺车、纺机，吴官营纺织组最近又添织机七张、纺车两架，连原有的共计织机四十七张，纺车一百七十八辆。旧城营村，试造新式脚踏纺纱机已成功，第一架已开始纺线，第二架正在赶造。纺织英雄宋爱的说：“有了新机子，妇女们就可作更多的活，也有时间学习了。”（按：鸡泽以前不是产棉区。）
    【新华社晋绥二十二日电】临县纺织业渐向企业化发展，该县家庭纺织除解决本县二十四万人的穿衣外，本年已输出土布十万匹以上。全县十二万妇女中纺织妇女即达八万一千六百五十七人，纺车四万二千四百四十五架，织布机三千二百七十三架，已做到家家纺纱织布。今年新花收起后，全县纺织妇女计划于旧历年底完成七万匹标准布。近年来沿大川村庄一带，群众集股合作经营之小型织布厂发展颇大，该县三交镇每天有一千六百余棉纱上市，供给各织布厂需要。妇女以纯纱出售，换回棉花再纺。有些村庄或个人则单独织布，以布换纱。
