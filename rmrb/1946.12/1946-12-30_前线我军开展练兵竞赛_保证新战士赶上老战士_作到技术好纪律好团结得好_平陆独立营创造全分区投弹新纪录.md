　　Our Frontline Troops Launch Military Training Competition
    Guarantee New Recruits Catch Up with Veterans
    Strive for Excellent Skills, Discipline, and Solidarity
    Pinglu Independent Battalion Sets New Grenade Throwing Record for the Entire Military District
    [This newspaper, Jilu Yu Frontline, 26th dispatch] The military training movement of our frontline field army corps has become more widespread and enthusiastic, and various units have put forward competitions with each other. A certain unit's first company's artillery squad competed with the second and third company's artillery squads, proposing: (1) Ensure that new comrades keep up with the learning of veteran comrades; (2) Consolidate the troops and thoroughly form a united front between new and old soldiers; (3) Do not fall behind in marching and obey orders in combat; (4) Maintain good mass discipline in peacetime and good prisoner of war policy in wartime. Other squads also competed with each other. Squad leader Cao Yuanlian from the Fifth Squad, who came from the Lanfeng battle, said to the new soldiers from the Shangguan Village battle: "I participated in several battles shortly after joining the Eighth Route Army. I saw Chiang Kai-shek's treachery a long time ago. I only have one goal in joining the Eighth Route Army: to intensify training, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries, and liberate our hometown so that we can reunite with our parents and wives." Xiao Jinxin, who came from the Renzhuang battle in Juancheng, has been selected as the mutual aid group leader. Hearing that he needed to "sharpen his knife," he quietly got up before dawn to sweep the yard clean, calling everyone to get up and practice military movements. He always took the lead in everything, and whenever there was a gap, he explained to the new soldiers: "The Eighth Route Army is really for the poor. If you do a good job, it will be reported in the newspaper. In the Central Army, the credit for doing a good job goes to the officials." Li Dengyun, a soldier who was liberated from the Dayanghu battle, also got up before dawn to practice combat movements, with an unprecedentedly high combat enthusiasm. Liu Yunfang, a special-class enemy-killing hero, was promoted to deputy platoon leader and resolved to turn his platoon into a model platoon, striving for the platoon to be fully equipped with American weapons. They practiced their skills and sharpened their knives day and night, practicing in the snowy ground before dawn. He said: "When I was a squad leader in the Second Company, I never let any comrade suffer a loss. This time, I guarantee that everyone will not suffer a loss."
    [This newspaper special report] The Taiyue Pinglu County Independent Battalion practiced grenade throwing and created the highest record in the entire military district. The Taiyue Military Region issued a special commendation. The Independent Battalion of the county persisted in military training work in the tense combat environment of opening up the situation and fighting against the mopping-up operations. In the three months of July, August, and September, the entire battalion universally carried out three weeks of military training. In the past, many comrades did not dare to throw grenades, and most of their throws were below 20 meters. Therefore, the leadership explained the power of using grenades in combat and advocated practicing grenade throwing. Now, everyone in the battalion can generally throw more than 30 meters. The First Company threw a maximum of 37 meters, and a minimum of 33 meters. The Second Company eliminated the record below 35 meters, with an average of over 37 meters. Now, every comrade in the battalion always carries a practice grenade, and practices throwing grenades at every campsite. The Taiyue Military Region specially commended the battalion for its constant automatic learning and seizing the gap in the war to carry out military training, and for creating the highest grenade throwing record in the military district, and called on all troops to learn from it.

　　前线我军开展练兵竞赛
    保证新战士赶上老战士
    作到技术好纪律好团结得好
    平陆独立营创造全分区投弹新纪录
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十六日电】我前线各野战兵团的练兵运动已更加普遍热烈，各部队互相提出竞赛。某部一连小炮班与二三连小炮班竞赛，提出：（一）保证新同志学习跟上老同志；（二）巩固部队，要彻底形成新老战士一条心；（三）行军不掉队，打仗服从指挥；（四）平时群众纪律好，战时俘虏政策好。其他各班之间也互相竞赛。五班副曹远连是兰封战斗时过来的，他对上官村战斗过来的新战士说：“我来八路军不久就参加了几次战斗，蒋介石卖国我老早就看到了，我参加八路军只有一条心，加紧练本领，打倒蒋介石反动派，解放我们的家乡，才能和父母妻子团圆。”在鄄城任庄战斗中过来的肖金信已被选为互助组长，听说要“磨刀”，天不亮就悄悄地起来先把院子扫得光油油的，叫大家起来演习军事动作，他凡事都在头里，一到空隙他就给新来的战士解释说：“八路军才真是为穷人呢，干好了工作就登报，在中央军那里，干好了功劳是当官的。”大杨湖战斗中被解放过来的战士李登云，也是天不明就起来练习战斗动作，战斗热情空前高涨。特等杀敌英雄刘云芳升为副排长后，就决心把他这排变成模范排，争取全排美械化。他们日夜不息的练功夫磨刀，天不明就在冬雪地里作演习。他说：“我在二连当班长没让全班同志受过一次损失，这次还保证不让大家受损失。”
    【本报特讯】太岳平陆县独立营练习投弹，创造全分区的最高纪录，太岳军区特通令嘉奖。该县独立营，在打开局面的和反扫荡紧张战斗环境里，坚持了练兵工作，在七、八、九三个月里，全营普遍的进行了三个星期的练兵。从前不敢打手榴弹的同志很多，且投弹大都在二十米以下。因此领导上就在作战中解释使用手榴弹的威力，提倡练习投弹。现在全营普遍的都能投三十米以上，第一连最高投三十七米；最少是三十三米，第二连消灭了三十五米以下的纪录，平均卅七强。现该营每个同志常带一颗练习弹，每到宿营地即练习投弹。太岳军区对该营这种经常自动学习及抓紧战争空隙进行练兵，并在该分区创造了最高投弹纪录，特通令表扬，并号召各部队学习。
