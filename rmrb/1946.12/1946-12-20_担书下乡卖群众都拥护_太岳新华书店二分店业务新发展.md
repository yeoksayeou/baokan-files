　　Carrying Books to the Countryside for Sale is Supported by the Masses
    New Business Development of the Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore Second Branch
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore Second Branch moved out of Fushan City, it has divided into four groups, carrying books to the countryside to sell in remote villages and markets in Qinshui, Shimin, Yicheng, and Fushan counties. People can buy books at any time, so it is welcomed everywhere, and they can often hear feedback and requests from the masses in order to improve publishing work. The branch's business has greatly developed. For example, in Fushan City, the average daily business volume in August was 2513.57 yuan, and in September, due to air defense preparations, the average daily business volume was 1161.08 yuan. On November 20, after starting to go to the countryside, the average daily business volume reached 5063.24 yuan. This number exceeds any previous period of the branch. Therefore, Comrade Wang Jun of the store said: "If you don't leave Fushan City, you won't know the countryside; if you enter Fushan City again, you won't forget the countryside." Now all comrades in the store live a hard life and concentrate on exploring and creating. Comrade Zhang Gengxin, the manager of the store, spares no effort. In addition to handling all the store's affairs and taking care of the work of the four groups, he also personally carries books to the countryside to promote sales. This new method of distribution that goes deep into the masses has become a new direction for future distribution work. Comrades who are engaged in distribution work in various places should learn from it.
    [Another report] The Cultural Cooperative established by Qinshui No. 2 High School has made a profit of 12476.66 yuan in the past three and a half months. After deducting the principal, each yuan yielded a profit of six jiao. Now, in order to meet everyone's needs, it has been decided to expand the shares again, absorb primary school teachers and students to become shareholders, expand the stationery business, and add two more people to carry books to the countryside within a week.
    [Another report] In order to solve the difficulty for some readers to buy books, the Xinhua Bookstore has specially selected some comrades from within to establish three mobile branches. The addresses are: (1) Donggou area of Jincheng; (2) Liucun area of Yangcheng; (3) Wangwu area.

　　担书下乡卖群众都拥护
    太岳新华书店二分店业务新发展
    【本报讯】太岳新华书店二分店自浮山城转多出来后，即分四个小组，担书下乡，到沁水、士敏、翼城、浮山各县的偏僻乡村与集市上出卖，百姓随时可买到书籍，所以到处受到欢迎，且经常可听到群众反映与要求，以便改进出版工作。分店业务大大发展，如在浮山城里，八月份每日平均营业二五一三·五七元，九月份因防空备战，每日平均一一六一·○八元，十一月二十日开始下乡，每日平均营业即达五○六三·二四元。这个数目超过该分店已往任何一个时期。所以该店王军同志说：“不出浮山城不知道下乡，再进了浮山城就忘不了下乡。”现全店同志生活艰苦，专心一意摸索创造。该店经理张更新同志更不遗余力，除处理全店事情及照顾四个组的工作外，并亲自担书下乡推销。这种新的深入群众的发行方式，成了今后发行工作上的新方向。各地做发行工作的同志应好好学习。
    【又讯】沁水二高开办的文化合作社，过去三个半月内，营利一二四七六·六六元，按本分红，每元得利六角。现为了适合大家的要求，决定再次扩大股金，吸收小学教员学生入股，扩大文具经营，新添二人，于一周内担书下乡。
    【又讯】新华书店为了解决一部分读者购书困难，特从内部抽出一部分同志，设立三个流动分店，地址在：（一）晋城东沟一带；（二）阳城刘村一带；（三）王屋一带。
