[This report from the JiluYu Frontline, December 18th] Stretcher teams in Zhangqiu, Kunshan, Shouzhang, Yunbei and other counties are actively training and morale is high. Stretcher teams in Zhangqiu and Kunshan have launched competitions by district. When discussing how to care for the wounded, the squad leader of the second squad in the first district of Zhangqiu, fearing that the wounded would need food on the road, volunteered to donate 1,000 yuan. Following this, some donated money, and others said, "The wounded are afraid of the cold, I will give them my clothes to cover them." Some suggested taking good care of the wounded's bowel movements, not being afraid of getting dirty. Cadres in each district of Zhangqiu also launched competitions, guaranteeing: (1) 100% completion of the tasks assigned by superiors; (2) good relations with the masses, without violating discipline; (3) caring for the wounded, not allowing them to suffer from hunger or cold. Kunshan also put forward competition conditions and stipulated reward and punishment measures. The Kunshan stretcher team, when stationed in a certain village, captured three Chiang Kai-shek special agents who were trying to disintegrate the stretcher team. The stretcher teams also used the gaps in training to help the masses in the stationed villages with their work. When the stretcher team was stationed in × village, a landlord did not have anything to sweep the floor with, so a stretcher team member from Zhangqiu County helped him make a dozen brooms. Another landlord went on a business trip and was worried that no one would do the work at home, but when he got home, he saw that the stretcher team living in his house had fed his cattle and cut the grass, and the water in the tank was overflowing, making him indescribably happy.

    保证百分之百完成任务
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十八日电】张秋、昆山、寿张、郓北等县担架队积极整训，情绪高涨。张秋、昆山担架队并以区为单位提出竞赛。当讨论如何爱护伤员时，张秋一区二小队小队长恐怕伤员在路上要吃东西，自愿献洋一千元；接着有的献钱，有的说：“伤员怕冷，我拿衣服给他盖上。”有的提出要好好照顾伤员大小便，不怕脏。张秋各区干部也提出竞赛，保证：（一）百分之百地完成上级给的任务；（二）群众关系好，不违犯纪律；（三）爱护伤员，不使伤员受饥饿、寒冷。昆山也提出了竞赛条件，并规定了奖惩办法。昆山担架队，在某村驻扎时，擒获瓦解担架队的蒋特三名。各担架队并利用整训空隙，帮助驻村群众作活，当担架队驻在×村时，某房东没有东西扫地，张秋县的一个担架队员就帮他做了十几把扫帚。另一家房东出差，很挂念家里的活没人作，但到家一看，住他家的担架队已把他的牛喂好了、草也镰好了，缸里的水往外漫，说不出的高兴。
