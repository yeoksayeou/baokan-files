Recognizing Who Are Our Own People
	Jiaodong Landlords Donate Funds to Make Winter Clothes for the Militia
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 14th] Landlords and gentry in Jiaodong County (Xin County, the northeastern part of the original Jiao County) recently voluntarily established a Patriotic Self-Defense Fundraising Committee, and are currently raising funds to help the militia joint defense team, which was established to protect the interests of all classes, to solve the problem of winter clothing. Women from landlord families in Shan County are secretly making military shoes. ××× went to welcome the Chiang troops when they invaded, but was extorted 6,000 catties of grain and was beaten by the Chiang troops. When the Chiang troops were repelled, he ran back to Zhang, the instructor of a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army, and said: "If you had come a little later, my family would have been finished. I would rather contribute more public grain to drive away the Chiang troops and protect everyone's interests."
