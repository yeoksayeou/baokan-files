Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. According to reports from Shanghai and Chongqing newspapers, various circles in Shanghai and Chongqing continue to protest the "Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty" privately signed by the Chiang government with the United States.

	On the 8th of this month, people from all walks of life in Shanghai, including industry and commerce, held a symposium. The famous lawyer Zhu Shenwen said: "The Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty is merely replacing what the Japanese invaders and traitors called 'Industrial Japan, Agricultural China' with 'Industrial America, Agricultural China.' The government authorities might as well have another 'Capital America, Labor China.' Otherwise, China will have a population explosion, and many people will be taken along. But taking people also requires capital, so we must cling tightly to the United States." The economist Wen Qisheng compared Zhang Zuolin with the Kuomintang authorities, saying: "Recalling that in the 12th year of the Republic of China, Japan demanded 'commercial lease rights,' and Zhang Zuolin did not dare to do so because of the opposition of the people across the country; but now China, as one of the 'Five Powers,' dares to do so. The Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty not only stipulates that renting land is the same as Chinese people, but also that land can be bought and sold, which is even more severe than Japan's demands on the Northeast. This is an insult to China." According to a banker surnamed Yu: " 'Reciprocity' is one-sided, like an adult racing against a child. For example, the United States restricts the Chinese population with immigration laws. What unilateral law do we have to restrict the United States?" Even a government economist ×× said, "This treaty is very unequal. Many rights are invisibly encroached upon by Americans, including port areas and territorial waters. The United States can sail ships to the Jinsha River. Do we have ships that can sail in the Mississippi River?" Shi Fuliang, one of the leaders of the Democratic National Construction Association, said: "The future of our middle class is gone. If we don't work for the United States, we can only become bandits. We firmly oppose this treaty." Jin Yueshi from the shipping industry said: "This treaty is a matter of life and death for us. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we demand a fundamental revision of this treaty."
	The Shanghai Federation of People's Organizations, with more than 300,000 members, issued a statement saying: "The Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty is absolutely unfavorable to China, unilaterally beneficial, humiliating, and a new unequal treaty." The statement pointed out that the treaty is "Industrial America, Agricultural China," "Capital America, Labor China," "Production America, Consumption China," and "Employment America, Unemployment China." As long as the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the treaty are followed, the entire Chinese economy can be placed under the control of American monopoly capital." The statement stated: "The Chinese people have learned a lesson from this that national independence and the interests of the people are not guaranteed before the realization of a democratic government. We firmly demand the abolition or revision of this treaty to strengthen the peaceful democratic movement to achieve this goal."
	People from industrial, commercial, financial, and cultural circles in Chongqing held a symposium on the 9th of this month at the Southwest Industrial Hall. Huang Mohan, general manager of Juxingcheng Bank, said: "According to the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty, the United States can set up banks everywhere in China, and our banks will be finished. Minister Wang (Wang Yunwu) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs expressed satisfaction with the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty. What else can we say?" Du Xinyuan, director of the Export Trade Association, said: "The United States will set up factories in China on a large scale according to the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty. With the United States' abundant capital and scientific technology, how can our Chinese factories compare?" Deng Huayi, chairman of the Shipping Industry Association, said: "The shipping industry is full of suffering, which is not enough for outsiders to understand. After seeing the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty in the newspaper, I feel even more frightened. All of you present are capitalists, and the government should take care of the lives of the industrial and commercial circles." Jing ×ren of "Minsheng" Shipping Company said: "I have carefully read the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty, and I can't find a single benefit for us. I guess this treaty was drafted by the Americans." Zhang Runxin, head of the Chongqing Economic Research Office, said: "Premier Sun said that China's status is a semi-colony. I feel that everyone must work hard in the future to maintain this status. Yuan Shikai signed the 'Twenty-One Demands' with Japan in order to become emperor, and the most fiercely contested point was only that Japan wanted to have freedom of residence and mining in the Northeast. But the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty is much more severe than this." Mr. Li, the representative of the National Chamber of Commerce Association, said: "After the victory, American goods flooded the Chinese market, which can be said to be a rape of Chinese industry and commerce. The Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty just gave it an ID card." Wang Lianxin, an accountant at Lixin Accounting Firm, said: "The treaty we have signed is a 'false equality' with an unequal starting point. In the past, the Tianjin Treaty only required navigation rights in the coastal areas of China, and the Twenty-One Demands only required residence, mining, and land ownership in southern Manchuria and other places. But the rights stipulated in the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty are much more than all treaties. This treaty will cause the Chinese peasant economy to suffer irreparable collapse." After a warm and painful speech at the symposium, everyone passed a resolution to establish a "Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty Research Association" to conduct detailed research on the treaty, and appointed Ji Zixiang, an economic researcher, and six others to be responsible.

　　沪渝工商各界举行座谈会
  　反对中美卖国商约
  　咸认丧权辱国为互古未有
    【新华社延安四日电】综合沪渝报载，沪渝各界继续抗议蒋政府私与美国签订的“中美商约”。
    本月八日，上海工商等各界人士举行座谈会，名律师朱绅文说：“中美商约不过是把过去日寇及汉奸们所谓“工业日本农业中国”换成“工业美国农业中国”而已，政府当局还不如再来一个“资本美国劳动中国”，非如此中国就有人满之祸，于是带上许多人。但带人也要资本，故要跟美国抱紧”。经济学者温淇生，以张作霖与国民党当局作比较说：回想民国十二年日本要求“商租权”，经过全国人民的反对，张作霖不敢为；而今为“五强之一”的中国，竟敢为。中美商约不仅规定租用土地和中国人一样，而且还可买卖土地，实比日本对东三省的要求还厉害，这对中国是一侮辱。据银行家俞某说：“互惠”是片面的，像成人与小孩子赛跑一样。例如美国以移民律限制中国人口，我们有什么单行法可以限制美国？”甚至官场经济学者××也说“这条约很不平等，许多权益都无形中被美国人侵占了去，包括口岸地方，公海领水，美国可以把轮船开到金沙江，我们有船可以到密士失必河中航行吗？”民主建国会负责人之一施复亮说：“我们中间阶级的前途没有了，不替美国当伙计，只有当土匪，我们坚决反对这个条约。”航业界金月石说：“这条约是我们的生死关头，为了我们的子子孙孙，我们要求根本修正这个条约。”
    拥有三十多万会员的上海各界人民团体联合会发表声明称：“中美商约是绝对不利于中国的，片面独惠的，丧权辱国的，新的不平等条约。”声明指出该条约是“工业美国农业中国”“资本美国劳动中国”“生产美国消费中国”与“就业美国失业中国”，只要该约第二条第三条的规定，便可把整个中国经济放在美国独占资本控制之下。”声明称：中国人民从此得到一个教训，在民主政府实现前，国家独立和人民利益是毫无保障的，我们坚决要求废除或修改这一条约，以加强和平民主运动来达到这一目的。
    重庆工商金融文化界人士，本月九日假西南实业大厅举行座谈会，聚兴盛银行总经理黄墨涵说：“按照中美商约，美国可以在中国到处设银行，我们的银行就全部完了。经济部王部长（王云五）对中美商约表示很满意，我们还有什么话可说。”出口贸易协会理事杜心远说：“美国将根据中美商约来华大规模设厂，以美国雄厚的资力科学的技术，我们中国的工厂那里比得过”。轮船业公会理事长邓华益说：“船业苦痛重重，不足为外人道，中美商业在报上看到后，更感惊慌。在座诸公都是资本家，应请政府顾全工商界的生命才行。”“民生”轮船公司经×仁说：“我仔细把中美商约读了一遍，找不到一条对我们有什么好处的。我猜想这商约是美国人拟的。”重庆经济研究处负责人张润薪说：“总理说中国的地位是次殖民地，我感觉大家今后必须努力，才能保持住这个地位。袁世凯为做皇帝而与日本签“二十一条”，争持最厉害的一点只不过是日本要在东北有自由居住开矿等。但中美商约比这厉害得多了。”全国商车公会理事长代表李先生说：“胜利后美货充斥中国市场，可以说是对中国工商业一种强奸行为，中美商约只不过给了它一个身份证而已。”立信会计事务会会计师王莲辛说“我们所订的这个商约是立足点不平等的“假平等”。昔天津条约只要求在中国沿海有航行权，二十一条只要求在南满等地有居住采矿及土地所有权，但中美商约所规定的比一切条约的权多得多，这条约将使中国农民经济受到不可挽救的沉沦。”座谈会经热烈而沉痛的发言后，大家通过成立一“中美商约研究会”，以便对该约详加研讨。并推定经济学研究者季紫翔等七人负责。
