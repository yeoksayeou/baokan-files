[Taiyue Dispatch, December 17th] All cadres in Changzi County are paying attention to rectifying the unreasonable phenomena of past fruit distribution. Many cadres, in order to maintain the noble qualities of revolutionaries, have deeply reflected on their selfish psychology during fruit distribution and are willing to admit their mistakes to the masses and return the fruit they underpaid for or embezzled. At the agricultural association's expansion cadre meeting, the reasons for the unfair distribution of fruit in the past were examined. The main reason was that the leadership did not have enough understanding that the distribution of fruit was the key to realizing "land to the tiller." A certain comrade of the county agricultural association deeply reflected on himself: "I used to think that I was serving the masses, but today I realize that I was taking advantage of the masses. I am willing to return all the things I underpaid for to the masses and apologize to them. This makes me feel relaxed and happy." Wang Haijin from the Fourth District has already returned the fruit he over-assessed in the anti-traitor liquidation in November. Under the influence of these model cadres, cadres throughout the county have continuously returned the fruits of struggle they underpaid for or embezzled.

    检讨贱买果实原因
    【本报太岳十七日电】长子全县干部均注意清理过去处理果实的不合理现象，许多干部为保持革命者崇高品质，深刻反省了自己分配果实时的自私心理，并愿向群众认错，退出贱买的或贪污的果实。农会扩干会议上，检查出过去果实分配不公的原因，主要是领导上没有足够认识分配果实是实现耕者有其田的关键，县农会某同志深刻的自我反省：“我过去认为自己是为群众服务的，今天才知道是讨了群众的便宜，我愿将全部贱买的东西退给群众，并向群众道歉，这样我便觉得轻松愉快了。”四区王海金，已将十一月份在反奸清算中多在这些模范干部影响下，全县干部连续退还贱买或贪污的斗争果实。
