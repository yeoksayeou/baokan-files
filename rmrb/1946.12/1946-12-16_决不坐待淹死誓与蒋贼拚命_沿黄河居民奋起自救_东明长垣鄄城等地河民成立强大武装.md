　　Rather Die Fighting Than Sit and Drown
    Residents Along the Yellow River Rise Up in Self-Defense
    River Dwellers in Dongming, Changyuan, Juancheng and Other Places Establish Powerful Armed Forces
    [Report from our correspondent group on the 13th] Residents along the Yellow River have spontaneously risen up, and a self-rescue movement has been universally launched along hundreds of miles of the old Yellow River course in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. It is reported that residents along the Yellow River are filled with righteous indignation at the Chiang government's disregard for their lives. They are planning to breach the Yellow River, attempting to use the diverted water to inundate our vast people, hoping to realize the conspiracy of destroying the liberated areas. In order to defend their homes, parents, wives, property, and ancestral graves, they have spontaneously risen up to establish their own armed forces, vowing to fight to stop the atrocities of the Chiang bandits. They said: "We cannot sit and wait for the Yellow River to come and drown us alive. We can only fight the Chiang bandits to the end in order to avoid death." Near Dongming and Changyuan, an armed force of more than ninety people, named the "River People's Self-Rescue Team," was established in late November and has begun operations upstream, reconnaissance of the Chiang side's breaching and flooding situation. The armed forces of the river people near Juancheng are being established, and it is reported that the number of people and weapons are more powerful than those near Dongming and Changyuan. They plan to be named the "Anti-Yellow River Self-Rescue Army." (Qi Yu)

　　决不坐待淹死誓与蒋贼拚命
    沿黄河居民奋起自救
    东明长垣鄄城等地河民成立强大武装
    【本报记者团十三日电】黄河沿岸居民纷纷自动奋起，自救运动已在冀鲁豫沿黄河故道数百里线上普遍展开。据悉沿黄河居民对蒋政府不顾沿河居民的死活，不久将进行黄河堵口，企图利用黄水归故，来淹没我广大人民，以冀实现摧毁解放区之阴谋，沿河居民莫不义愤填膺，为保卫自己的家乡父母妻子财产及祖宗的坟墓，已自动奋起成立自己的武装，誓为制止蒋贼之暴行而奋斗。他们说：“我们不能坐待黄水到来活活淹死，只有与蒋贼拚命到底，以求不死。”东明长垣附近已有一支九十余人的武装，定名“河民自救队”，已于十一月下旬成立，并于上游开始活动，侦察蒋方堵口放水情形等。鄄城附近河民的武装正在成立中，人数与武器据悉比东明长垣附近者更为强大，拟定名为“抗黄自救军”。（齐语）
