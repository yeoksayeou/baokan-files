　　【Our Newspaper Taiyue 5th Dispatch】 The people of Jiyuan, unable to bear the trampling of Chiang's troops, are resisting Chiang's troops with the spirit and will of "heads can be severed, blood can flow, but we will never yield," and have written many heroic deeds worthy of praise. Comrade Niu Zehua, director of the Women's Association of Sun Village, Comrade Yan Laogu, a Communist Party member of the militia in Baijian, and Comrade Li Ziying, a cadre of the Farmers' Association in the Fifth District, are the best examples of heroic sacrifice for the people of Jiyuan. When the enemy attacked Jiyuan, Comrade Niu Zehua led the people to evacuate, but was unfortunately captured. Chiang's troops tortured her several times, asking, "Is the Kuomintang good or the Communist Party good?" But Comrade Niu Zehua always answered unyieldingly: "Even if you kill me, the Communist Party is good!" When she was thrown into the river by Chiang's troops and was half-dead from drowning, she continued to scold as soon as she regained consciousness: "Who doesn't know that Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor!" In the end, this fearless and staunch heroine was still shouting "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" when she was buried alive by Chiang's troops. Comrade Yan Laogu fought with three Chiang's troops in plain clothes, killing one Chiang's soldier with his last grenade, and was captured because he had no weapons. Huang Chongyi, the puppet district chief, asked him: "Have you struggled against me in the past?" He answered generously: "I have! It's a pity I didn't struggle to death with you, a traitor!" Huang Chongyi, enraged, asked again: "Did you come to burn the blockhouse the night before yesterday?" "I came! It's a pity I didn't burn you guys to death!" Comrade Yan was still shouting "Oppose the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" when he was stabbed to death by Chiang's troops with bayonets. After Comrade Li Ziying, a cadre of the Farmers' Association of the Sixth District, was captured, the "Revenge Team" held a meeting, attempting to use the masses to threaten Comrade Ziying into submission. They threatened him, asking: "Are you still leading the people to stand up for themselves?" Comrade Li, with great righteousness and awe, answered Chiang's troops righteously in front of the masses: "The people will surely stand up for themselves, and they will surely be able to stand up for themselves. No bad guys can stop them! If you kill one of me, there will still be countless cadres to lead the people to stand up for themselves." The masses were moved to tears. Seeing that the situation was not good, Chiang's troops hurriedly wanted to kill him. Comrade Li died a martyr in the high-pitched shout of "It is most glorious to die for the people's liberation." The heroic sacrifice of the above comrades has aroused countless people to unite as one and resolutely avenge the dead!

　　为人民翻身光荣牺牲
  　牛泽花烈士等临死不屈
  　痛骂卖国贼不怕蒋军抛下河群众悲愤流泪誓为死者复仇
    【本报太岳五日电】济源人民不堪蒋军蹂躏，以“头可断、血可流、至死不屈”的精神和意志，反抗着蒋军，并写下了许多可歌可泣的英勇事迹。孙庄妇女会主任牛泽花同志，白涧民兵共产党员燕老谷同志，五区农会干部李子英等同志，是为济源人民英勇牺牲的最好榜样。牛泽花同志在敌人进攻济源时，她带领人民转移，不幸被俘，蒋军数次酷刑拷问“国民党好共产党好？”但牛泽花同志始终不屈的回答：“你们杀了我也是共产党好！”当她被蒋军抛在河里淹得半死不活时，她一清醒就继续叫骂：“谁不知道蒋介石是卖国贼！”最后这位无畏坚贞的女英雄被蒋军活埋时，仍高呼：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”燕老谷同志和三个蒋军便衣撕斗，用最后一颗手榴弹把一个蒋军炸死，因没有武器而被俘了。伪区长黄崇义问他：“过去你斗争过我没有？”他慷慨回答：“斗争啦；可惜没有把你这个汉奸斗争死！”恼羞成怒的黄崇义又问：“前天夜晚烧炮楼你来了没有？”“来啦！可惜没有把你这些家伙烧死！”燕同志被蒋军用刺刀刺死时，仍高呼：“反对卖国贼蒋介石！”六区农会干部李子英同志被俘后，“复仇队”召开大会，企图利用群众威胁子英同志屈服，他们威胁问他：“你还领导人民翻身不翻身？”李同志大义凛然，在群众面前，理直气壮的回答蒋军：“人民是一定要翻身的，一定能翻身的，什么坏家伙也阻止不住！你们打死我一个人，可是还有无数个干部去领导人民翻身”。群众被感动得偷流眼泪，蒋军见势不佳，急欲害死他，李同志在“为人民翻身而死最光荣”的高呼声中殉难了。以上这些同志，英雄的牺牲，激起无数人民齐心一致，坚决要为死者复仇！
