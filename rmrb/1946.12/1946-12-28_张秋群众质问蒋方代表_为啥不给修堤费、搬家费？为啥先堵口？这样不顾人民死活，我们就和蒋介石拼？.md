    (From our correspondent in Ji-Lu-Yu, 25th) On the morning of the 19th of this month, more than 600 people from Zhangqiu gathered in front of the residence of the Yellow River Commission representatives. They elected eight representatives to question Qi Shou'an, Yan Zhenxing and others: "Are you here this time just to take a look and then release the water? Why release the water when we haven't relocated?" "Why are you blocking the breach before our dike is repaired?" "Why not allocate funds to us for dike repair? Why not give us relocation fees?" Mr. Qi Shou'an replied: "We have discussed all the issues with Director Duan, and studied them overnight. We will not release the water until the dike is repaired. We will appeal to higher authorities with a clear conscience." The people's representatives proposed: "Since you say so, please sign a statement." Qi said: "No, we have no authority, we cannot make decisions and sign." The people's representatives said: "If you can't make decisions, what are you here for?" "We are afraid of being fooled again, it's not acceptable without a signature." Qi said: "I guarantee to take your opinions back." The people's representatives then demanded "Immediate disbursement of dike repair funds, and one and a half million yuan for relocation fees," and to "Tell Chiang Kai-shek, we know his conspiracy. How many people in Henan were drowned by the water release! This time we cannot be drowned again; if the water is released, we will fight him to the end." "Tell him, he drinks the people's blood, and must listen to the people's voices!" "You all eat the people's food, and you must speak for the people, and not let Chiang Kai-shek decide everything." At this time, Director Duan arrived. The people's representatives saw a relative and immediately burst into tears, saying: "Chiang Kai-shek even sells the country, how can he care about our lives? If the water is released at this time, we can only die," "Even if we die, we won't even have a place to be buried." The masses again demanded that Qi sign a statement. Director Duan said: "Who doesn't know about the conspiracy of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, who doesn't oppose it?" We must rise up and fight for it. Committee Member Qi finally stated that they absolutely guarantee to take the people's opinions back and solve the difficulties of the river people.

　　张秋群众质问蒋方代表
    为啥不给修堤费、搬家费？为啥先堵口？这样不顾人民死活，我们就和蒋介石拼？
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】张秋群众六百余人，于本月十九日晨齐集黄委会代表寓所门前，推举代表八人，向齐寿安、阎振兴等提出质问：“你们这一次来是不是看一下就放水呢？我们没有搬家为啥放水呢”？“我们堤还没有修好，为啥先堵口呢”？“为啥不拨给我们修堤款呢？为啥不给搬家费呢”？齐寿安先生答称：“一切问题我们都和段主任谈过了，研究了一夜，堤修不好不放水过来，我们本着良心向上级要求”。群众代表提出：“你既然这样说，请给俺签个字吧”。齐说：“不行，我们没有权，不敢当家签字”。群众代表说：“你既然来就能当家，不当家来看什么呢”？“我们被哄怕了，不签字不行”。齐说：“我保证把你们的意见带回去”。群众代表随提出“马上发给修堤款，发给一百五十万万元搬家费”，“告诉蒋介石，他的阴谋我们知道，河南放水淹死了多少人呀！这次不能再淹我们；要是放水，我们就全体和他拼”。“告诉他，他喝了人民的血，也要听听人民的话”！“你们都吃的老百姓饭，也得替老百姓说说话，不能让蒋介石说啥算啥”。这时段主任来了，群众代表看见亲人，马上流出泪说：“蒋介石连国还卖了，他能关心我们的生活吗？这时放水，我们只有死”，“我们死了连地方埋也没有”。群众又要求齐给签字，段主任说：“美帝国主义和蒋介石的阴谋谁不知道，谁不反对呢”？我们要起来争取。齐委员最后提出我们绝对保证把民众意见带回去，解决河民的困难。
