　　Taihang Female Labor Hero Hao Er'man
    Leads the Entire Village in Developing Wool Spinning

    [Report from Yu She by our newspaper] Hao Er'man, a famous female labor hero in Taihang, led the entire village of Taoyang in Yu She to develop wool spinning production, which brought great wealth to the entire village. This year, the village was affected by early frost and did not complete the planned "cultivate three, surplus two" target. She immediately called on the entire village to carry out winter production and develop the wool spinning movement, and established the Yuxin Factory. The village's two major cooperatives also provided strong support for wool production, promoting the involvement of labor teams and mutual aid groups in an intense movement of spinning wool yarn and knitting wool sweaters. The child Hao Sanxiao and his mother divided the work of spinning and weaving, earning 21,000 yuan in half a month, enough to buy more than two shi of rice. Female student Hao Suzhen and her four sisters weave an average of six wool vests per day, earning 67,000 yuan per month. In addition to covering all school expenses, they can also supplement the family economy, exceeding "cultivate three, surplus two." Currently, the wool spinning movement in Taoyang has created a surge throughout the village. Large quantities of wool sweaters are available on the market every fair, affecting seven surrounding villages, including Yutou, Nancun, Xiangyang, and Xizhuang, where the wool spinning movement is widely carried out. Since the beginning of winter, an average of 300 wool sweaters and 2,000 jin of wool yarn have been traded at the Yunzu fair, with sales of 2.15 million yuan. The finished wool products are sturdy and beautiful. Merchants from Changzhi, Wu'an, and other places are rushing to the Yunzu market to purchase wool sweaters to supply the winter needs of the military and civilians. (Geng Rong, Yun Wu)
