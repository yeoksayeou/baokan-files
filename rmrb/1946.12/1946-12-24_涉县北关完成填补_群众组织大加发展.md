　　【Changzhi Dispatch from this Newspaper】After the "leveling and balancing" in She County North Gate was completed and the fruits of democracy were distributed, mass organizations greatly developed. Following the final reckoning with nine stubborn landlords, including Ren Guangyu and Ren Juwu, the masses of North Gate recovered the fruits of their blood and sweat: 140 mu of land, over 200 rooms, over 5,500 shi of grain, 7,300 silver dollars, and a total of 360 pieces of clothing, furniture, etc. After democratic discussion by the masses regarding the distribution of the fruits, 19 councilors were elected. First, an investigation was conducted, and the 19 extremely poor households, 28 poor peasant households, and 82 middle peasant households in the entire village were divided into three grades of extremely poor, three grades of poor peasant, and two grades of middle peasant, according to the actual conditions of the family. The extremely poor and retired soldiers without land were given 2 mu of paddy fields and 2 mu of dry land per person; households with two or more people were given 2.5 mu per person. Poor peasants were supplemented to 2 mu per person. Families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers were generally raised by one grade; for example, Zhao Yunting and Ren Quanting were both poor peasants, but Zhao, as a family member of a revolutionary soldier, was one grade higher than Ren. The extremely poor and those with weak labor were given nearby and good land; for example, the extremely poor Tian Yuzhong alone was given more than 3 mu of good land. Poor and middle peasants, and those with strong labor, were given land that was farther away and of poorer quality. Other properties were distributed according to the principle of supplementing what was lacking. During the movement, the farmers' association increased from 59 to 67 people, and the women's organization also increased from 23 to 34 people. The "leveling and balancing" movement in the entire North Gate has basically ended, and now it is focusing all its efforts on winter production.

　　涉县北关完成填补
    群众组织大加发展
    【本报长治讯】涉县北关“填平补齐”结束，民主分配果实后，群众组织大加发展。北关经过对任光玉、任聚伍等九个顽固地主最后清算，群众共收回血汁果实：土地一百四十亩，房屋二百余间，粮五千五百余石，银洋七千三百元，衣物家具等共三百六十余件。果实分配经群众民主讨论，选出评议员十九人，首先进行了调查，将全村十九户赤贫，二十八户贫农，八十二户中农，按家庭实况划分为赤贫三等，贫农三等，中农二等。赤贫及无土地之荣退军人一户一口者，分给水地二亩，旱地二亩；一户二口以上者，每人分给二亩五分。贫农每人补足二亩。贫苦抗属，都较一般提高一级，如赵云亭与任全亭均系贫农，赵为抗属便比任提高了一级。赤贫及劳力薄弱者分近地好地，如赤贫田玉中一人即分了三亩多好地。贫、中农及劳力强者，分较远较坏地。其他财物，是根据缺什补什的原则分配。在运动中农会由五十九人增加到六十七人，妇女组织也由二十三人增到三十四人。全关“填平补齐”运动已基本上结束，现正全力进行冬季生产。
