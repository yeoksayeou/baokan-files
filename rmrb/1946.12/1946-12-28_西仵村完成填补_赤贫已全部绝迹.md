　　Xiwu Village Completes Land Redistribution
　　Absolute Poverty Eliminated

　　[Our newspaper Changzhi dispatch] The land redistribution movement in Xiwu Village, Licheng, which began in mid-November, has now concluded victoriously after more than a month. Absolute poverty has been completely eliminated, and the majority of poor peasants have also risen in status. Although the village had undergone rent reduction and investigation of hidden wealth in 1942 and 1944, the peasants were not thoroughly emancipated. More than 60 peasant households still did not have enough land to sustain themselves. Of the 22 landlord households in the village, who owned 1,872 mu of land before the war, still held more than 870 mu a month ago. Of the 994 mu they had reduced, only 189 mu were returned to the peasants. The remaining 800+ mu were all sold by the landlords themselves, and the fruits of their exploitation of the masses over the years had not been thoroughly accounted for. This time, the land redistribution inspection proposed "a thorough emancipation." After the winter school's bitterness sessions, more than a hundred questions were raised regarding major despots like Hua Lantai and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent Liu Guanghan. Twelve small villages near Xiwu also coordinated and fermented, joining the movement one after another. On the 20th of last month, a joint struggle meeting of more than 400 people was held, and the two traitors Liu and Hua were struggled against. Subsequently, the other landlords were liquidated. The issues of feudal exploitation by old rich peasants were thoroughly resolved through discussions and arbitration. In total, through this liquidation, the peasants recovered 1,176 mu of land, more than 150 shi of grain, more than 450 rooms, and more than 130 earthen kilns. After the distribution of the spoils, all the poor peasants in the village's 210 households received benefits, the 30 households in absolute poverty were completely eliminated, and 59 poor peasant households rose to become middle peasants. Currently, the average land per person in the village is at least five mu. The masses are happily saying, "This is a thorough emancipation!"

　　西仵村完成填补
    赤贫已全部绝迹
    【本报长治讯】黎城西仵村填平补齐运动于上月中旬开始、时经月余，现已胜利结束，赤贫已全部消灭，大部贫农亦获上升。该村虽经四二、四四两年的减租与查减、但农民并未彻底翻身，尚有六十余户农民的土地不够维持生活。全村廿二户地主，战前有土地一千八百七十二亩，月前仍有八百七十余亩，在其减少的九百九十四亩中，偿还农民者仅占一百八十九亩，其余八百余亩全是地主自己变卖，历年剥削群众的血汗果实，大部未经清算。这次翻身检查提出“要翻透身”，经过冬学诉苦、对大恶霸花兰太，蒋特刘光汉等提出问题百余件。西仵附近十二个小村也经串通酝酿，纷纷卷入运动。上月二十日召开四百余人的联合斗争大会，对刘、花二奸霸进行了斗争。继即对其他地主进行清算。对旧富农封建剥削部分问题，则用座谈、仲裁的方式彻底解决。总计这次清算，农民共收回土地一千一百七十六亩，粮食一百五十余石，房四百五十余间，土窑一百三十余孔，经分配果实后，全村二百一十户中贫农都获得果实，三十户赤贫全部消灭，五十九户贫农上升为中农。现该村每人平均土地最少也在五亩以上。群众都高兴的说：“这可翻透身啦”！
