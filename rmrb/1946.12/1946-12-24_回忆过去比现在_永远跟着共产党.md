　　[By our newspaper from Weixian, 21st] In southern Hebei, the turned-over peasants in various places are thinking about the past and comparing it with the present, and their patriotic enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. In the "Think About the Past" meetings in Zhangzhuang, Ningnan, peasants universally recalled the suffering inflicted on them by the landlords and the benefits given to them by the Communist Party. Under the slogan "Follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao," five peasants requested to join the Communist Party, wanting to defend their fruits under the leadership of the Communist Party. Peasants in Dongwangxi felt from their recollections that the days after turning over were the best time of their lives. They realized that to protect the good times, they must take up guns and fight against big and small Chiang Kai-sheks, so 170 peasants joined the militia. In Youfang Village, the county, after the "Think About the Past" meeting, more than 200 peasant families broke with superstition, tore down idols, and paid homage to Chairman Mao. They compiled a song at the meeting to recall the past: "Burning incense and making offerings, praying to gods who don't move, the rich are always rich, the poor are still poor. Now comes Chairman Mao, he is more capable than gods, distributing houses and land, we are no longer poor; everyone has rights, forever following him." In Guocun, Renxian, Meng Laobian, who is already fifty years old, recalled in the "Think About the Past" meeting that he had no land in the past and sometimes had to beg for food, working as a short-term laborer during the busy farming season, suffering the enslavement of the landlords. Now he has been allocated land, grain, etc. He said, "I can't forget the benefactor, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, even after I die. I will do whatever the Communist Party tells me to do." When calling for winter studies, he said, "We must respond to the call, I will compete with the young men to see who learns the most skills in winter studies." After the women's congress in Yangmocheng Village, Daming, held the "Think About the Past" meeting, a labor army movement was launched. Ninety-two women members made 30 pairs of cotton shoes in seven days. An old lady from Youfang Village, Guanxian, whose village was ravaged by the Kuomintang army Qi Zixiu's troops during the Anti-Japanese War, was forced to flee with her family of five to Henan to beg for food. Her old partner and son starved to death outside, leaving only two young children and her to return. After the mass movement, when distributing the fruits, her eleven-year-old child heard that his family would be allocated ten mu of land, two houses, and one dan of grain, so he quickly ran from the meeting place to home and said, "Grandma, we don't have to beg for food this time, when I grow up I will become a Eighth Route Army soldier and ask my brother to stay at home." The old lady told everyone, "We can't forget the kindness of the Communist Party." When conscripting soldiers, she personally sent her son to the front line. Chengci Shang District is the battlefield of the Pinghan Campaign. After the land reform, the masses compared the past with the present and recalled the ravages of the Chiang army and the past oppression and exploitation of the landlords. They shouted the slogan "No longer let big and small Chiang Kai-sheks slaughter us," and 277 young people joined the army.
