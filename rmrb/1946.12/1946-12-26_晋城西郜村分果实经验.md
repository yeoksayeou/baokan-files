　　Jincheng Xigao Village's Experience in Distributing Fruits of Struggle
    Zhao Peixin
    Last winter, Xigao Village began to struggle against traitorous and puppet elements. Initially, only a dozen or so of the poorest and most oppressed masses rose up to struggle. They were isolated and weak, struggling while also being afraid. With the help of cadres, they managed to seize eight "shi" (a unit of dry measure) of grain. When distributing the fruits of the struggle, they were unwilling to give any to those who had not actively participated in the struggle. After mobilization, they decided to give some to those who had suffered but hadn't participated in the struggle, in order to inspire their fighting spirit. As a result, more than eighty households received a share, which united more people and led to the victory of the second struggle. The second struggle yielded over sixty "shi" of grain and other jewelry and clothing. The distribution method was to divide households into three categories based on their poverty, and then add points based on their level of activeness. In addition, after everyone suggested it, some poor households who had not participated in the struggle were also given a share. This time, more than one hundred and sixty households received the fruits of struggle. During the third distribution, it was discovered that dividing according to household property didn't account for differences in family size. After discussion, it was decided to distribute based on the number of people, with households exceeding three people being counted as three, and those with less than three people who were active being given special consideration. This method of distribution – according to household property, according to the number of people, and according to the level of activeness – was more satisfactory to everyone. The above three struggles all addressed village-wide issues of local tyrants and bullies.

    This spring, the struggle deepened to the issue of rent and interest, resulting in the seizure of more than one hundred "mu" (a unit of land area) of land and other movable property. Some people advocated for continuing the previous distribution method, but the thirty or so households who had raised issues immediately objected, saying, "This is all our own hard-earned debt; how can it be distributed to everyone?" Some people felt this made sense, while others remained silent. After a day of discussion with no resolution, the village cadres stayed behind to mobilize these households who had raised issues, explaining that the hard-earned debt was recovered through everyone's joint efforts, and that everyone should receive a share. After these households were persuaded, it was decided to use the previous method, adding the issue of the amount of debt to become according to household, according to the number of people, according to the level of activeness, and then adding points based on the size of the debt. The items were uniformly converted into grain prices for distribution. This method of distributing according to circumstances and supplementing according to needs was agreed upon by everyone. Later, the struggle further developed, resulting in the seizure of more than five hundred "mu" of land, which was also distributed according to need to more than fifty landless and land-poor peasants. The land was also adjusted based on its distance from the village, benefiting twenty or so households. Those with less land received more, those without land received a lot, those with land far away received land closer to the village, and those with land nearby gave up some for land farther away. The elderly, widowed, and those without labor power were given good land close to the village. Xigao Village has basically realized "land to the tiller." Currently, the family with the most land in the whole village is a rich peasant family with seven people and seventy "mu" of land. Generally, rich peasants have five to six "mu" of land per person, middle peasants have three to four "mu," and poor peasants also have around three "mu."

    Regarding the distribution of livestock, the ten animals seized were sold to the masses at a 50% discount. The money from this was then used to buy back five animals, which were again sold to the masses. The second time, four animals were bought back and sold to everyone. Finally, two animals were bought and kept specifically for military dependents. Each time, the households lacking livestock would pool their shares to buy them together. The price was lowered again and again until it was exhausted, and almost every household had livestock. Finally, one or two households didn't have enough money to pool shares, so everyone contributed one or two "dou" (another unit of dry measure) to help them pool their shares. In this way, a total of twenty-one livestock were acquired (ten more than before). Seventeen households shared one animal, and at least six households shared one animal. Even the elderly and widowed received a share. Currently, the whole village has a total of forty-two livestock, and each household has livestock.

　　晋城西郜村分果实经验
    赵培心
    西郜村去冬开始斗争奸伪分子，起初只有一二十个最贫苦最受压迫的群众起来斗争，他们势孤力薄，一面斗一面又怕，在干部帮助下，才斗出八石粮食。分果实时都不愿分给不积极斗争的，经动员才决定给未参加斗争而有苦的人分些，以启发他们斗争情绪，结果分得果实的共八十余户，这样才团结了更多人，取得了第二次斗争的胜利。第二次斗争得果实粮六十余石及其他首饰衣服等，分法是按家庭贫苦情况分三等，再按积极程度加分，另外对贫苦未参加斗争的户经大家提出也分给一些，这次共一百六十多户得果实。第三次分时发现按家产分等有些家人口多少不一样，讨论出以人计分，如人口超过三口的按三人计算，不足三口而又积极的特别照顾。这样按家产分等、按人计分、按积极加分的分法，大家都较满意。以上这三次斗争都是全村性的奸霸问题。
    今春斗争深入到租息问题，共得土地一百多亩，还有其他浮财，分时有些主张仍按以前办法，但提问题的三十余户马上提出意见说：“这都是我们自己的血汗债，还能大家分？”有些人觉得有道理，有些就不吭气，讨论一天没结果，晚上村干部留下这些提问题户动员，说明血汗债是大家共同讨来的，并给大家也分些，打通思想后，决定按上次办法，加上问题成为按家、按人、按积极程度，再按问题大小加分，将东西统一折成粮价分，这样按情况分、按需要补，大家都同意。以后斗争更发展，斗出地五百多亩，也按需要分给五十多家无地及少地的农民，更以地的远近调剂了二十来户。这样地少者补，无地者多得，近地者补远地，远地者补近地，孤寡无劳力者给好地近地，西郜村基本上实现了耕者有其田。现全村地最多者有一家富农七口人七十亩地，一般富农每人有地五至六亩，中农三至四亩，贫农也有三亩左右。
    关于牲口分法，是将斗争出的十头牲口按五扣卖给群众，再以这款买回了五头，又卖给群众，第二次又买回四头又卖给大家，最后买了两头喂着专给军属用。这样每次都由缺牲口户凑股伙买，价钱赔了又赔，直到赔完，各户也差不多都有了牲口。最后有一两户没钱凑股，大家你一斗我二斗的为他凑了股。这样前后共弄成了二十一个牲口（比原来多十个），有十七户伙一个的，最少也是六户伙一个，孤寡也有份。现全村共有牲口四十二头，各户都有了牲口。
