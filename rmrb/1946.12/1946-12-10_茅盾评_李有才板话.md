　　Mao Dun Reviews "Li Youcai's Rhymes"
    "Li Youcai's Rhymes" is a novel in a new form (different from the chapter-style "Heroes of Lüliang Mountain"), yet it is a popular work. The term "popular" can be substantiated by the following points: First, the author writes about this subject matter from the people's standpoint. His love and hate are clear, and his emotions are fervent; he is a member of the people, not an observer. The reason he can do this is simply because he not only lives among the people but also works and struggles alongside them. Second, the peasants in his writing are genuine peasants, not intellectuals dressed in peasant clothing. The "melancholy" and "indulgence in fantasy" characteristic of some intellectuals are absent from the peasants in the author's writing. Third, the dialogues of the characters in the book are vivid spoken language, and their actions are also typical of peasants. Fourth, the author does not spend much time depicting the personalities of the characters but only reveals their personalities through the development of the struggle (which is the story in the book). Fifth, in places where descriptions are needed (background or characters), the author often uses a passage of "clapperdoodle," concise, powerful, and full of humor – perhaps this is because the author wants to take care of the title of his novel, "Li Youcai's Rhymes," but we can imagine how strong the emotional response these "clapperdoodle" would have on the audience when this novel is recited among the peasants, then we will know that this novel’s fresh technique is of great profundity.
    Due to the convergence and interaction of two efforts, the literature and art of the liberated areas have already acquired a new form. On the one hand, there are the revolutionary petty-bourgeois writers who live and fight together with the broad masses of the people, who resolutely refrain from being complacent and self-satisfied with what they are used to, and who humbly learn from the people, seeking a lively and simple popular form of expression. On the other hand, there are the masses of people who have turned themselves over under the democratic regime, whose creativity has been liberated and given new stimulation, and who have begun to use the "eternally new" folk forms to sing the praises of their new life and express their courage and determination to fight for truth and justice. "Li Youcai's Rhymes" is one such new form that has emerged. Undoubtedly, this marks a step forward towards popularization and also a step towards national form, although I dare not say that this is the national form.

### 茅盾评“李有才板话”

　　茅盾评“李有才板话”
    “李有才板话”是一部新形式的小说，（这是和章回体的“吕梁英雄传”不同的）然而这是大众化的作品。所谓“大众化”，可以从下列诸点得到证明：第一、作者是站在人民立场写这题材的。他的爱憎分明，情绪热烈，他是人民中的一员而不是旁观者。而他之所以能如此，无非因为他是不但生活在人民中，而且是和人民一同工作一同斗争；第二、他笔下的农民是道地的农民，不是穿上农民服装的知识分子，一些知识分子那种“多愁善感”、“耽于空想”的脾气，在作者笔下的农民身上是没有的；第三、书中人物的对话是活生生的口语，人物的动作也是农民型的；第四、作者并没多费笔墨刻画人物的个性，只从斗争（就是书中故事）的发展中表现了人物的个性；第五、在若干需要描写的地方（背景或人物），作者往往用了一段“快板”，简洁、有力、而多风趣，——这也许是作者为要照顾到他这小说的题名“李有才板话”，但是，我们试一猜想，当这篇小说在农民群中朗诵的时候，这些“快板”对于听众情绪上将发生如何强烈的感应，便知道作者这一新鲜的手法不是没有深刻的用心的。
    由于两种努力的汇合与交互影响，解放区的文艺已经有了新的形式。这两种努力一方面是和广大人民生活且战斗在一起的革命的小资产阶级作家为要真正服务于人民而毅然决然不以本来弄惯的那一套自满自足，而虚心向人民学习，找寻生动朴素的大众化的表现方式；另一方面是在民主政权下翻了身的人民大众，他们的创造力被解放而得到新的刺激，他们开始用“万古常新”的民间形式、歌颂他们的新生活，表现他们的为真理与正义而斗争的勇敢与决心。“李有才板话”是这样产生的新形式的一种。无疑的，这是标志了向大众化的前进一步，也是标志了进向民族形式的一步，虽然我不敢说，这就是民族形式了。（摘自茅盾先生：“关于李有才板话”一文）
