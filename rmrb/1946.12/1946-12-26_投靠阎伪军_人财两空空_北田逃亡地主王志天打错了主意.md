　　Joining the Yan Puppet Army
    Leads to Ruin
    Landlord Wang Zhitian of Beitian Makes a Terrible Mistake in His Escape
    Homeless, Grain Confiscated, Forced to Sell His Old Bones
    [Our Newspaper Yuci News] The Yan army forces people to become ghosts, and the fleeing landlords can only lament their fate! Wang Zhitian, a landlord from Beitian Village in the border area of Yuci, is over sixty years old and once exploited poor people by seizing more than three hectares of land. During the land reform movement, the masses in the village settled accounts with him but left him enough property for his entire family to live on. Wang was still able to live peacefully with the masses. In mid-November, after the Yan puppet army occupied Nanyao Village, twelve miles from Beitian, they vigorously enticed landlords who were settling debts to flee to the Yan-controlled area. Wang Zhitian was confused for a moment and secretly transported his entire family, young and old, livestock, carts, and some grain to Nanyao. Unexpectedly, the Yan army was sweet-tongued but ruthless. First, they forced him to "borrow" half of his grain, livestock, and carts, and he had to serve the Yan army every day. Secondly, they crammed his family into a large house and stipulated a monthly rent of 35,000 yuan, and they also found two guarantors to prevent him from harboring the Eighth Route Army. Oil, salt, vegetables, all had to be purchased from the Yan army's "rationing" office, and even a catty of sorghum stalks cost 100 yuan. If he complained that the price was too high, the Yan army would raise their eyebrows and say, "Expensive? Don't you know that our unit is here specifically to protect (!) you? You truly have the stubborn head of a landlord!" At the beginning of this month, the Yan special agent handed Wang Zhitian two hand grenades and said, "Prepare to take revenge on the people!" Before Wang could answer a word, he was incorporated into the "rolling team." In the past half month, the Yan special agents often drove them to raid grain from our border villages for the Yan army. Often, they didn't grab a single grain or blade of grass and were instead severely hit by our joint defense blasting teams. Wang Zhitian began to regret it: he secretly compared it in his heart, and it was still better in the Eighth Route Army's area. Once, after returning from a grain grabbing mission, he stepped on a landmine on the way back, blowing a "rolling team" member surnamed Chen half to death and slightly injuring two others. At this point, Wang Zhitian was filled with mixed feelings. He thought about what kind of life the "rolling team" was, thought about how even though the villagers had settled accounts with him, his family could still live well as long as they worked hard; thought about how special agents harmed people, thought about how powerful the Eighth Route Army was... So he cried and said to his companions: "I made a mistake, I made a mistake - I am over sixty years old..." Before he could finish his words, he was heard by the special agent accompanying the team, who insisted that he was communicating with the Eighth Route Army and was detained upon his return.

　　投靠阎伪军
    人财两空空
    北田逃亡地主王志天打错了主意
    住无房屋粮被缴  还得去卖老命根
    【本报榆次讯】阎军逼人变鬼，逃亡地主徒唤奈何！榆次边地北田村地主王志天，年逾花甲，曾剥削穷人土地三顷多。该村群众在土地改革运动中，曾向其清算并给他留下足够全家生活的财产。王与群众仍相处无事，上月中旬，阎伪军侵占我距北田十二里的南要村后，大肆引诱清债地主向阎占区逃亡。王志天一时糊涂，竟将全家老、少、牲口、大车及一部分粮食，偷运至南要。孰料阎军口甜心辣，首先强迫“借”去一半粮食、牲口、大车，还得天天给阎军支差。其次把他一家人塞在一间大房子里，每月规定出租金三万五千元，还找了两家保人，恐其窝留八路军。油、盐、菜蔬，都得从阎军“配给”处购买，一斤黍杆也得出一百元。稍嫌定价高了，阎军就眉毛一棱说：“贵？你知道本部是专来保护（！）你们的吗？真是斧子劈不开的地主脑袋”！本月初，阎特递了两颗手榴弹给王志天，说：“准备向老百姓报仇吧！”没等王回答一个字，就被编进了“滚滚队”。半个月来，阎特经常驱使他们替阎军到我边沿村抢粮。常常没抢到一粮一草，反遭我联防爆炸队严重打击。王志天开始后悔了：心里暗暗比较，还是八路军地方好。一次抢粮回来，归途中踏响地雷一枚，把一个姓陈的“滚滚队”员炸得半死，还轻伤两个。王志天至此百感交集，想起“滚滚队”是啥生活？想起乡亲们虽然清算了他，家小只要劳动，还能过好生活；想起特务如何害人，想起八路军力量大，…………于是哭着对同伙说：“我的主意错啦，错啦——我六十多岁的人啦………”！他话未完，被随队特务听见，硬说他通八路军，回去就被扣了。（郭思俊）
