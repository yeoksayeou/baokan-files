    “Liu Yicheng: Song Gai is Your Wife!”
    How a New Woman Fights Against a Traitor
    ·Cheng Guang·
    Song Gai, in her twenties, only escaped her life of suffering after we liberated Wuzhi last year. She voluntarily married our Comrade Liu Chengyi, and then went to school for cadres to study. They worked and studied part-time, and the couple were very affectionate. Even when they disagreed, they resolved it through suggestions and never quarreled once. She called this life "the freedom and happiness of the new society." In mid-October, when the sound of Chiang's army attacking northern Henan began, she angrily and sincerely said to her husband, "I am your lover in life, and your wife in death. Go and fight those bandit gangsters with peace of mind!" After saying that, she quickly made preparations for battle, rolled up the woven cloth, buried the rest of her belongings, and started a guerrilla life with her sister and the women in the village. After the enemy occupied Jiaozuo, she and her sister transferred from Wuzhi to Bo'ai, preparing to go up and find the Eighth Route Army, to find her husband. But when they reached the Jiegou area, the enemy blocked the road and they couldn't get through, so they returned to their hometown and hid in her aunt's house. Her aunt had a fellow villager named Wang Nao, a bandit leader, nicknamed "Old Bastard." This time he came back with Chiang's army and turned the village upside down again, raping women, trafficking people, robbing things, killing people... One day, Wang Nao saw that Song Gai had brought two good pieces of cloth at her aunt's house, and insisted on taking them away. Song Gai glared at Wang Nao and tightly hugged the cloth. She thought, "This cloth is for making a coat for my loved one. It's freezing cold, and he's marching and fighting outside. I can't let him get cold. I can't let these bandits take it, even if it means death." Seeing Song Gai's strong attitude, Wang Nao didn't act. That night, she and her sister said goodbye to their aunt, determined to take the cloth and flee west. As soon as they left the village, the "Old Bastard" discovered them and chased after them like a mad dog. They were caught by the bandits, and the cloth was also snatched away. Tears welled up in her eyes, and hatred filled her heart. She was so anxious that she was about to go crazy. The bandits dragged them back to the village and pulled them in front of a large pit for burying people, pointing to the eight dead heads sticking out of the pit and saying, "Run again! This is how we'll treat you." Song Gai stared expressionlessly at the scene in front of her, angrily cursing, "Butchers, dog prostitutes, beasts who kill people! You stole my cloth and still want my life. Do whatever you want!" At this time, Wang Nao changed his mind and wanted to skin another layer of flesh off these people, so he locked them in a dark room, preparing to sell them to the south of the Yellow River the next day.

    The door of the dark room was tightly closed. Song Gai anticipated how these bandits might deal with her. She recalled her year of happy life, no longer being able to see her beloved husband and parents... She prepared to fight the enemy to the last. She said to her older sister, "I want to die. I would rather die than be someone else's beast of burden and be played with by the traitorous army. Someone will avenge us!" After saying that, she took out the fountain pen that her husband had given her to learn to write, picked it up and cried for a while, then put it down, and picked it up again. Later, she stood up and sat down again. In order to convey her unyielding will and her hatred for the enemy to her husband who was bravely fighting, she shed tears, rolled up her sleeves, endured the pain, and used the tip of the pen to pierce into her own muscle, using the dots of deeds and mixing with her own blood, stroke by stroke, she pierced this line of words: "Liu Yicheng: Song Gai is Your Wife!" After piercing it, she stood up proudly with a spirit of heroism and unyieldingness. She felt that she had nothing to worry about, only waiting to use her life to fight the enemy to the end. But her older sister, born of the same mother, hugged her tightly and cried. That night, while the big bandit Wang Nao was busy writing the "indenture" to sell her sisters, the old man next door to the dark room really felt that this outrageous thing was too inhumane. Conscience drove him, and he risked opening the door of the dark room and whispered to them, "Run quickly!" Finally, in the middle of the night, Song Gai and her sister broke through the enemy's blockade and ran to the location of our army, in the direction where the Eighth Route Army was firing!

    “刘义成：宋改是你的妻！”
    一个新女性怎样与卖国贼搏斗
    ·程光·
    二十多岁的宋改，在去年我解放武陟后，她才摆脱了痛苦生活，自愿的和我们刘成义同志结婚了，随后便进干属学校念书。半工半读，夫妻间非常亲爱，就是相互有不对，也都是用提意见的方式来解决，从未吵过一次嘴，他对这种生活称作是：“新社会的自由福。”十月中旬蒋军进攻豫北的炮声一响，她便愤怒而诚挚的对她丈夫说：“我生是你的爱人，死是你的妻，你安心去打那些土匪强盗吧！”说罢她便迅速的作了战斗准备，把织好的布卷起，其余的东西埋藏起来，和她姐姐及村上的妇女一块儿过起游击生活来。敌人占了焦作，她和她的姊姊从武陟转到博爱，准备上去找八路军，找她的丈夫，但走到界沟一带敌人把汽路卡住了，过不来，便又返回自己的家乡，躲在她姑姑家去。姑姑有一个乡亲，叫王脑，是个土匪头子，外号“老挠（坏）种”，这次随蒋军回来，把村上又给闹翻了，强奸妇女，贩卖人口，抢东西，杀人，…………一天，王脑在她姑姑家看宋改带了两个好布，便硬要夺去，宋改怒视着王脑，紧紧的抱着布。她想着：“这布是要给我的亲人做大衣的，天寒地冻，他在外行军打仗，我不能叫他受冷，死也不能给这些强盗拿去。”王脑见宋改态度强硬，未下手。当夜她姐妹俩即告别了姑母。决心带着布向西逃跑，刚出村被“老挠种”发觉了，便疯狗似的追赶去。他俩被强盗捉住了，布也被抢去了，她泪在眼里，恨在心头，急的简直快要发疯了。强盗把他俩扭回村来，拉到一个活埋人的大坑前，指着坑里露着的八个死人头说：“再跑！就这样的对待你”。宋改毫无表情的注视着当前的情景，愤恨的骂着：“刽子手狗娼子，杀人的野兽，抢走我的布，还想要我的命，想怎样就怎样吧！”这时王脑变了心计，想从人肉上再活剥一层皮，便把她俩关在一间黑房里，准备第二天把她俩卖到黄河南面去。
    黑房的门紧闭着，宋改料想到这些强盗们可能怎样的处理她。她回想着一年来的幸福生活，再不能见到亲爱的丈夫、父母………………她准备着要和敌人进行最后的搏斗，她向她的大姐说：“我要死，宁死也不再作别人的牛马和卖国军玩弄，会有人来给咱报仇！”说罢，她便从身上掏出她丈夫送她学写字的一支钢笔，拿起来哭一阵，放下去，又拿起。后来，她站起来又坐下，为了把她坚贞不屈的意志和对敌仇恨的心，在临死前带给她那正在英勇战斗中的丈夫，便流着眼泪，卷起袖子，忍着疼痛，在胳膊上以笔尖刺入自己的肌肉，用点点的事迹和着自己的鲜血一笔一划的刺成了这样一行字：“刘义成：宋改是你的妻！”，刺成之后，她带着一身英勇不屈的气慨，骄傲地站起来。她觉得她已经无所牵挂，只等待着用自己的生命最后向敌人一拚了，可是和她一母所生的姐姐却紧紧地抱着她哭起来。这天夜里，大土匪王脑正忙着写出卖她姐妹俩的“人契”的时候，那黑房隔壁的老汉，却实在觉着这丧天理的事太有失人性了，良心驱使着他，他冒险弄开了黑房门，低声的告诉她们：“赶快跑”！宋改姐妹俩，终于在深夜里朝着八路军打枪的方向，突过敌人的封锁，跑到了我军的驻地！
