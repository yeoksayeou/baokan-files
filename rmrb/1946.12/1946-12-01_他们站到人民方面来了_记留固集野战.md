　　They have come over to the side of the people
　　——A record of the Battle of Liuguji

　　The 312th Regiment of the 104th Brigade of the 41st Division of the Chiang army, stationed in Liuguji, received orders from their division headquarters on the morning of the 21st of last month to reinforce the 104th Brigade headquarters in Shangguan Village. As the Chiang army was advancing towards Liuguji, a unit of our army took the opportunity to recover Liuguji and began to pursue the Chiang army on the vast plains. The 312th Regiment rushed towards Shangguan Village in three routes, with two infantry battalions on the left and right wings, and the regiment's direct units such as the mortar company and signal soldiers sandwiched in the middle. Another infantry battalion provided cover… However, a unit of our army suddenly appeared in front of them, putting the Chiang army in a dilemma of being attacked from both sides and unable to advance or retreat. They had no choice but to turn northwest, but were closely pursued by our army, and the enemy did not even have a chance to turn around and shoot. Our warriors began to shout: "Brothers, you are all forced into the army. Chiang Kai-shek sent you to the north to attack the liberated areas to send you to your deaths. We don't want our brothers to die in vain." The brothers who laid down their weapons in the Battle of Juancheng also shouted loudly: "Friends, come to the Eighth Route Army and lay down your weapons! I was also captured in the Battle of Juancheng. The officers and brothers here treat us like family. Chiang Kai-shek is fighting a civil war and wants us to die, but we won't die. Please lay down your weapons and let's unite to oppose the civil war." The mortar company commander of the 312th Regiment raised his hand and shouted, "I am against the civil war." He said, "Chiang Kai-shek treats us miscellaneous troops so harshly, turning our battalions into companies, and our companies into platoons. Even the squad leaders have become soldiers. We have suffered enough humiliation, and I don't want to continue anymore." Gou Zaihua, the commander of the regiment, also laid down his weapon. He thought the deputy commander was dead, so he asked his comrades to say, "Please bury our deputy commander." Just as he was speaking, more than fifty wounded soldiers from the regiment walked over, one of whom was their deputy commander. The deputy commander told him, "The Eighth Route Army brothers took good care of me and have already applied medicine." Commander Gou was deeply moved by these touching scenes, seeing that their wounded soldiers had been rescued and sent to the hospital. He was so moved that he couldn't speak for a long time. Afterwards, Commander Gou Zaihua counted the numbers, and except for a few who made futile sacrifices, more than a thousand people in the entire regiment laid down their weapons and gloriously came over to the side of the people.

　　他们站到人民方面来了
    ——记留固集野战
    占驻留固集之蒋军四十一师一○四旅三一二团，奉他们师部命令于上月二十一日晨增援上官村之一○四旅旅部，当蒋军刚刚向留固前进时，我军某部即乘机收复留固，并在辽阔的原野上，开始追击蒋军。三一二团分三路奔向上官村，左右两翼是两个步兵营，中间夹着迫击炮连，通讯兵等团部直属机关，另有一个步兵营掩护………………但是我某部又突然在他的前面出现了，蒋军处在前后夹击与进退两难的境地，只好转身折向西北，但又被我军紧紧尾追着，敌人连回头打枪的机会也没有。我们的勇士们开始喊话了：“弟兄们，你们都是被迫当兵的，蒋介石把你们开到北方来进攻解放区，是要你们来送死，我们不愿弟兄们白白死掉。”鄄城之战放下武器的弟兄们，也高声呼叫：“朋友们，放下武器来八路军吧。我也是鄄城战斗时被俘虏的，这里的官长和弟兄们，对我们跟亲人一样。蒋介石打内战，叫咱们死，咱们就不死。请你们放下武器，咱们联合起来反对内战。”三一二团迫击炮连长高举起了手，高叫：“我是反对内战的。”他说：“蒋介石待我们杂牌军真苛刻，把我们的营编成了连，连编成排，班长都当了战士。我们受欺侮受够了，我不愿再干下去了。”该团苟在华团长也放下了武器。他以为副团长死了，所以要求同志们说：“请把我们的副团长掩埋一下。”正说着，从那边走过来了五十多个该团的伤员，其中一个就是他们的副团长，副团长告他说：“八路军弟兄对我照顾很好，已经上好药了。”苟团长看到这许多动人的情景，看到他们伤员都被救下来送到医院去，他感动极了，好久说不出话来。过后苟在华团长点了点数，他们全团除少数作了无谓牺牲外，千余人全部放下武器，光荣的站到人民方面来了。
