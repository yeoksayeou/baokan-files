    Jinnan First Commissioner Carries Large Quantities of Goods
    to Front Lines to Comfort Soldiers
    "Fen River Troops" Leaders Go to Various Battalions and Companies to Express Regards
    [Our Frontline Reporter Team, 11th Dispatch] Bei Zhongxuan, commissioner of the Jinnan First Administrative Office, and 18 others from the慰劳团(comfort group) arrived at the front headquarters a few days ago in Linqing, paying respects to Commander Liu Bocheng, Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, and Deputy Political Commissar Zhang Jichun. Representing the 1.5 million people of the First Administrative Region of Jinnan, they extended their greetings to the heroic soldiers who had won successive battles, and brought 10,000 bars of soap, 1,000 packs of cigarettes, millions of yuan in funds, a portion of beef jerky and other foods, and numerous letters of appreciation, personally going to comfort a certain unit at the front lines. Commissioner Bei said: "The masses who have been emancipated in the rear are supporting the front lines by doing a good job in enlisting soldiers and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers resisting Japan, and they are saving money and food to donate to the military. All cadres and soldiers of the Wuxun County militia brigade, as well as the Party, government, military, and civilian cadres of the Fourth District, will donate all the clothing, firewood, grain and other expenses provided by the government from October to the end of the year to the military, and all clothing and food will be provided by their families and production within the organs. The Wuxun Normal School donated 200,000 yuan, and each person saved four liang of rice per day, saving a total of 2,000 jin of millet to comfort the front lines. Teachers from the Guantao Elementary School raised 500,000 yuan at a joint meeting. Shop owners and employees in Linqing City raised 5 million yuan, and students from the Linqing City First Branch School donated 3,000 yuan from their daily savings. Many women donated money from their own spinning and weaving production, which was unprecedentedly enthusiastic and active." Commissioner Bei and others personally went deep into various regiments and battalions to report on the tense work situation in the rear, and the commanders and soldiers were all extremely gratified, saying: "We did not expect such great progress in Jinnan in the past few months. We will definitely kill the enemy with peace of mind at the front and protect our liberated elders." After returning from the troops, Commissioner Bei expressed his impressions to reporters, saying: "We saw that the troops are full of new atmosphere. Their equipment has improved, and most of them have been replaced with new weapons sent by the bandit Chiang. They are all as lively as dragons and tigers, and they are seizing the gaps in the war to actively study military affairs and politics. Their combat skills and mass discipline have greatly improved. Before participating in the patriotic war, a regiment needed at least 50 carts to march, but now they cherish the people's strength even more, and a regiment only needs 5 carts to pull ammunition and military supplies. While comforting the troops, we also learned from the troops."

    [Our Frontline 7th Dispatch] Military and political leaders of the "Fen River Troops" went to various battalions and companies to express their appreciation, and the commanders and soldiers' morale for killing the enemy was unprecedentedly high. Comrade Han Wengao, a cultural worker from the "West Sea Unit," said: "I am a probationary party member. If I sacrifice in battle, I request the Party to approve me as a full party member." Squad leader Liu Minggui of the Third Company said: "I used to have personal problems, but now I am determined to put aside personal problems and put the interests of the revolution first." The military leader of the Fen River Detachment also wrote in the部队生活报(Troops Life Report) calling out: "If we can combine courage and technique well, victory must be ours; cadres should love soldiers, and this should also be reflected in command."
