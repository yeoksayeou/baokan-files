　　【Benbao Weixian Seventh Dispatch】The conspiracy of feudal landlords in Chali Village, Guan County, to buy off village cadres and use clan conflicts to rule the masses has been smashed. The village's Farmers' Association Director and Militia Committee Director had been bought off by local despotic landlords from the Feng and West Zhang families, becoming their lackeys. Historically, the Feng family, and the East and West Zhang families had conflicts with each other. Under the deception of various clan rulers, poor people also lacked unity. Landlords and despots continued their brutal rule over the masses. After the district deployed rent reduction and interest rate control, the Farmers' Association and Militia Committee Directors privately issued passes to allow despotic landlords to escape, disperse and transport their property, and bought off militiamen and Farmers' Association members to guard the despotic landlords' homes and harvest crops. They rejected people recommended by other village cadres to join the militia and Farmers' Association. People from all clans demanded the replacement of the Farmers' Association Director and Militia Committee Director, but they failed to unite due to mutual conflicts. Based on the above characteristics, district cadres first reorganized the organization, especially vigorously developing women's organizations, because women had less clan prejudice. Soon, two-thirds of the masses in each clan were organized. The three clans unified their thinking, demanded emancipation, and replaced the Militia Committee Director. The people of the whole village showed close unity in action. The leadership closely carried out education on "Poor people of all clans are one family" and "Unite to overthrow our oppressors together," and exposed the conspiracies of various clan feudal forces to provoke disunity among the masses. The emotions of the masses, who had been oppressed for a long time, were extremely high. They are now launching a fierce struggle against feudal forces.

　　察里粉碎地主阴谋不分家族团结翻身
    【本报威县七日电】冠县察里村封建地主收买村干、利用各族矛盾统治群众的阴谋，已被粉碎。该村农会主任、武委会主任曾受了冯家、西张家恶霸地主收买，成了他们的狗腿。村中冯家、东西张家历史上互有矛盾，在各族统治者的欺骗下，贫苦群众之间也互不团结，地主恶霸对群众仍继续着残酷统治。区上布置查减后，农会、武委会主任私开路条，将恶霸地主放跑，将其财物疏散运走，并收买民兵、农会员，给恶霸地主看家，收割庄稼；其他村干介绍的群众参加民兵、农会，他们都不要。各族群众都要求更换农会主任和武委会主任，但因互有矛盾，未能团结起来。根据以上特点，区干部首先整理组织，特别大力发展妇女组织，因为妇女宗派观念不深。不久各族已有三分之二的群众组织起来，三族群众统一了思想，要求翻身，撤换了武委会主任，全村群众在行动中表现了亲密团结。领导上抓紧进行了“各族穷人是一家”，“团结起来齐翻身”的教育，并揭露了各族封建势力挑拨群众团结的阴谋，久被压榨的群众情绪极高，现在正对封建势力开展猛烈斗争。
