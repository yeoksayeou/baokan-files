[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] This newspaper recently received a letter from Comrade Su Hua, Director of the Armed Committee of the Fourth Military Sub-district of Taihang, from the Daocheng Road South Guerrilla Base Area, discussing the situation of the guerrilla war there, saying: Except for Lingchuan, the Fourth Military Sub-district is almost entirely a new area. In a year of mass mobilization, the emancipated masses, in order to defend the fruits of their struggle, joined the militia in batches. They seized weapons from the old rulers and armed themselves. Before the enemy's attack, the leadership proposed to persist in the guerrilla war north and south of Daocheng Road, and everyone had great confidence. Cadres burned documents and lightened their loads, and militiamen prepared guns and ammunition. When the enemy began to attack the villages along the edge of Wuzhi, the village militiamen engaged the enemy. The Gao Village militia once hindered a group of enemies, preventing them from advancing for a day. The enemy in the Qin River occupied Yue Village, but was counterattacked and retaken by Comrade Bai Yan, the deputy director of our county, leading the militia. This is enough to prove that everyone's fighting spirit is tenacious. However, due to the enemy's overwhelming superiority in troops, at the beginning, the militia south of the road once transferred to the mountainous area north of the road. After a short period of reorganization in the mountains, the militia organized the first batch of work teams, combined with the army, to enter the enemy camp. When the disaster-stricken cadres and the families of militiamen and the emancipated masses saw us, they were truly "ecstatic," the scene was hard to describe. When the surrounding special agents and local bullies heard that we had arrived, they fled in panic. Many robbed masses risked their lives to return home to help us fight. In the twenty days of October, militia work teams in various places fought 66 battles of varying sizes, liberating 30 villages, killing, wounding, and capturing 127 enemy puppet troops and 58 special agents, seizing 5 rifles, 1 pistol, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, more than 100 head of livestock, destroying 1 car, destroying 1 bridge, 2 boats, rescuing hundreds of people, and seizing more than 6,000 shi of public grain. In the actual struggle against the enemy, the militiamen are learning how to use weapons and fight against the enemy. The Yang Juhe team in Jiaozuo won seven battles in eight days, and the Liu Village battle repelled more than 60 enemies with 15 people, killing and wounding 4 enemies, and even attacked the enemy stronghold in Lifeng (the East Daqing Well of the Jiaozuo Large Coal Mine is located here) during the day, killing and wounding an enemy sentry. The Liu Xiliang team in Boai fought 13 times in a month, killing and wounding 12 enemy puppets and capturing 13 special agents alive. The Lian Zhizhong team in Xiuwu went deep behind enemy lines to the Guancun stronghold and captured Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. With the help of the blasting team in Lingchuan, the counties at the foot of the mountain have initially learned blasting. The Yang Juhe team in Jiaozuo laid landmines on the road for cars and destroyed an enemy car. The militiamen in the urban area cooperated with the troops to attack Yanhe and destroyed four enemy blockhouses. Estimating that the enemy would retaliate, they laid three landmines on the road the enemy would pursue. The next day, the enemy did come, the three landmines exploded, and three enemies were killed or wounded. The Boai militia attacked Beiwu Village and estimated that the Lifeng enemy would come to support, so they cut off the enemy's wires and laid landmines at the junction, all of which were stepped on by the enemy, causing unknown casualties. Under the threat of the militia's blasting movement, the Jiaozuo enemy has rarely moved out. Now the cadres and militiamen in various counties are very interested in landmines. The military sub-district has made hundreds of sets of tools for making stone mines and called on all localities to make stone mines, and blasting will become a more widespread movement. Now all the transferred militiamen have been reorganized into dozens of work teams after a short period of rectification and training, and they are engaging in guerrilla warfare and entering behind enemy lines. The mass guerrilla war in this area has developed from "spots" to "areas".

　　数十民兵武工队楔入道清路南北
  　太行四分武制好大批石雷工具
    发动广泛爆炸运动
    【本报特讯】本报近接护太行四分区武委会主任苏华同志自道清路南游击根据地来信，谈及该地游击战争形势说：四分区除陵川外，几乎全是新区。在一年的群运中，翻身群众为了保卫斗争果实，一批批的参加了民兵。他们从旧统治者手中夺取了武器，武装了自己。敌人进攻前，领导上便提出坚持道清路南北游击战争，大家都很有信心。干部们烧文件轻装，民兵们准备好了枪弹。敌人开始进攻我武陟边沿各村时，村村民兵与敌人接火。高村民兵曾阻滞一股敌人，使它一天不得前进。沁河南敌人进占岳庄，又被我县的副主任白岩同志率领民兵反击夺回。这足证大家斗志顽强。但由于敌人以绝对优势兵力压境，开始我路南民兵为曾一度转多路北山地，在山地经过短期休整后，民兵即组织了第一批武工队，结合军队进入敌营。受灾难的干部与民兵家属翻身群众见了我们真可谓“欢喜若狂”，其情景实难笔述。周围的特务恶霸听说我们来到，闻风而逃，被劫群众多冒死返家助我作战。十月份的二十天中，我各地民兵武工队大小战斗六十六次，解放村庄三十个，毙伤俘敌伪军一百二十七名、特务五十八名，缴获步枪五支、短枪一支、子弹数百发、牲口百余头，炸毁汽车一辆，破坏桥一座、船二只，抢救群众数百，抢运公粮六千余石。民兵们在实际的对敌斗争中，学习着使用武器与对敌斗争的方法。焦作杨聚和队的八天七战七捷，刘庄战斗以十五人击退敌人六十余，毙伤敌人四名，乃至白天袭击李封（焦作大煤窑东大井在此）敌据点，毙伤敌哨兵一名。博爱刘喜良队一个月作战十三次，毙伤敌伪十二名，活捉特务十三名。修武连志中队深入敌后关村据点，捕捉蒋伪特务。在陵川爆炸队的帮助下，山下各县已初步学会了爆炸。焦作杨聚和队在汽车路上埋设地雷炸毁敌人汽车一辆，市内区民兵配合部队袭击颜河，毁敌炮楼四座。估计敌人必来报复，便在敌人追击路上埋地雷三个，次日敌人果然来了，三个地雷炸了，敌伤亡三名。博爱民兵袭击北未村，估计李封敌会来援，乃割断敌人的电线，在接合处埋设地雷，都被敌人踏响，伤亡不明。在民兵爆炸运动的威胁下，焦作敌人已很少出动。现在各县干部与民兵，对地雷很感兴趣。分武已制好打石雷家具数百付，号召各地打石雷，爆炸将成为更广泛的运动。现在所有转移出的民兵，已大部经过短期整训，组织成数十个武工队，接敌游击与进入敌后，此地群众性游击战争已由“片”向“面”开展了。
