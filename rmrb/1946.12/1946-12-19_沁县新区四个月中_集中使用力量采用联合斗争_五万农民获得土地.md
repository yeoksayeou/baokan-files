    [This newspaper's dispatch from Taiyue on the 14th] The mass movement in Qin County started on July 13th and has lasted for more than four months. In the newly liberated areas, 50,000 farmers have been involved in the struggle and have obtained 50,000 mu of land. On the third day after the liberation of Qin County, more than 140 cadres were transferred from various district and county systems to form a peasant emancipation work team, concentrating their efforts to mobilize the masses. The movements to speak out about grievances and seek revenge first broke out in Nanchen and Loucun in the suburbs of the city. By August 17th, the number of cadres participating in mobilizing the masses throughout the county had increased to more than 240, accounting for more than 90 percent of the county's cadres. Currently, including those sent by the military region and sub-district, as well as teachers, students, drama troupes, and activists from the county, there are more than 4,000 people leading the mass movement. Due to the concentration of forces to resolutely implement the method of bold mobilization and give play to the role of activists, more than 2,000 emancipation heroes leading the struggle, such as Zhang Maohai in Nanchen, have emerged, becoming the vanguards in the mass movement and uniting the vast number of peasants to jointly emancipate themselves. During the autumn harvest, the movement spread vigorously, and large-scale joint struggles involving 400 to 500 people to 5,000 to 6,000 people were launched one after another in various places, with unprecedented scale, enabling the movement to involve 50,000 of the 90,000 people in the newly liberated areas of the county within three and a half months, and obtain 50,000 mu of land, 8,000 houses, 9 shi of grain, 500 head of livestock, and 1,700 pieces of clothing. In some villages, such as Qingxiu, Qingtun, Nantou, and Licun, the poor peasants and feudal exploitation have been completely eliminated, and the principle of "land to the tillers" has been initially realized.
