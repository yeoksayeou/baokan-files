　　The people of Qin Yuan, during the arduous struggle of the three-year siege of the city gate by the Japanese invaders, suffered greatly from the destruction caused by the Japanese invaders, leaving the people destitute. This winter, with the help of the democratic government, they are actively engaged in production, and most have overcome the difficulty of winter clothing. However, a small number of people are still unable to resolve this issue. The First Administrative Office immediately called on all personnel of the agencies to reduce their clothing and food expenses to alleviate the difficulties of the people in the city gate area. First, the comrades of the administrative office donated 12,415 yuan in local currency, with Comrade Zhang Zhidao donating the most, as much as 1,000 yuan. The cook, Bai Dan'er, also donated all of his saved 200 yuan, saying, "If they can't wear cotton clothes and suffer from the cold, it's the same as me suffering from the cold. If they all wear clothes, my heart won't be cold either." This money has been sent out, and other agencies are in the process of carrying out the effort, and it is expected to be fully resolved.

　　沁源人民
    寒冬缺衣
    太岳一专署发起救济
    【本报太岳二十三日电】沁源人民，在三年围困城关日寇的艰苦斗争中，被日寇破坏甚大，人民一贫如洗，今冬在民主政府帮助下积极生产，大部份克服了冬衣困难，但有少数人仍无法解决，第一专署即号召各机关人员缩衣节食，解救城关人民的困难。首先专署同志捐出本币一万二千四百一十五元，以张志道同志为最多，一人就捐出一千元，炊事员白旦儿也把节省下的二百元全数捐出，他说：“他们穿不上棉衣受冻，亦和我受冻一样，他们都穿上衣服，我心上也就不冷了。”此款已派员送去，其他机关正在进行，预料足能全部解决。
