　　Peasants on the North Bank of the Qin River Defend Their Homes and Fields
    People's Armed Teams Active in the Suburbs of Bo'ai
  　Local Tyrants Dare Not Reverse Settlements; Landlords Return Home One After Another
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi Dispatch, 1st] Under the slogan of "Defending the Fields and Protecting the Homeland," the broad masses of liberated peasants in the area north of the Qin River have formed several small and capable militia armed work teams, extending into the suburbs of Bo'ai, striking at small groups of enemies and "Homecoming Legions," and launching political offensives. The enemy was so frightened that they tightly closed the east, west, and north gates, not daring to leave the city casually. A few local tyrants who attempted to counterattack no longer dared to pursue the fruits of struggle from the peasants. A local tyrant in the North Gate said, "If we ask them for it now, they will ask us for it in the future." "If we seal their doors today, they will seal our doors tomorrow." For a time, landlords who had been deceived by the enemy and fled to the city returned home one after another. On the evening of the 16th of last month, a part of our main force, combined with the Second Armed Work Team, blew up the Dan River highway bridge on the Qin-Bo highway and completely destroyed a bridgehead bunker that the enemy had spent a month building. On the evening of the 18th, a part of our main force, again combined with the First and Second Armed Work Teams, harvested 15 li of enemy mine lines on the Qin-Bo Road. Due to the active activities of our armed work teams, the enemy's arrogance in harassing has been severely挫折(zhécuò frustrated), our rear is stable, and the markets in Sanwangzhuang and Xishangji are even more prosperous than usual, and prices are becoming more stable. Now the county headquarters has also transferred more than 60 capable militiamen to specialize in learning how to lay mines, preparing to vigorously carry out the explosion movement.

　　沁河北岸农民保乡保田
    民武队活跃博爱城郊
  　恶霸不敢倒算地主纷纷返乡
    【本报长治一日电】沁河以北地区广大翻身农民，在“保田保乡”的口号下，组成×支短小精干的民兵武工队，伸入博爱城郊，打击小股敌人及“还乡团”，开展政治攻势。吓得敌人紧闭东西北三门，不敢随便出城。少数企图反攻的恶霸，不敢再向农民追要斗争果实，北关一恶霸说：“现在咱和人家要，将来人家还要给咱要”。“今天咱封人家的门，将来人家也会封咱家的门”。一时被敌欺骗跑到城里的地主也纷纷返乡。上月十六号晚我主力一部，结合武工第二队，炸毁沁博公路上的丹河汽车桥，并把敌人花费一月时间修成的一座桥头碉堡彻底破坏。十八号晚我主力一部又结合武工一、二两队，于沁博路收割敌雷线十五里。由于我武工队的积极活动，敌人出扰凶焰已遭重挫，我后方秩序安定，三王庄、西尚集市场较之平时尤为繁荣，物价日趋平稳。现该县指挥部又抽调六十余名精干民兵专门学习埋雷，准备大力开展爆炸运动。
