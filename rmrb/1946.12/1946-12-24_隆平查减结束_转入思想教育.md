　　Longping Land Investigation and Rent Reduction Concludes
    Transition to Ideological Education
    [This newspaper's Weixian dispatch on the 22nd] Following the victory of the Longping Land Investigation and Rent Reduction, consolidation work is now underway. The leadership has proposed carrying out ideological education, to make the masses recall their own history, recognize the exploitation and oppression of the landlords from their own personal experiences, understand why they were poor, and affirm that they should follow the Communist Party. In terms of current affairs, the masses should recognize that Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of American imperialism, will not talk about peace, and that only by repelling the attacks of the Chiang bandits can they protect their homes and land. It should also be explained that our self-defense has been fruitful and that the Chiang army is bound to be defeated, to establish the masses' confidence in victory. Regarding the cultivation of mass leaders and the establishment of peasant leadership organizations in villages and districts, each village should deeply deliberate from the women's association groups from the bottom up, elect emancipated heroes, and elect members of the district women's federation. The women's committee members of each village should be the natural representatives. One representative can be elected from every thirty members in each village, and the district committee members should be elected from the representatives. The election procedures should be simple and the ceremony should be grand. To protect the interests of the masses, each village must reorganize and develop the militia, and the old militia members must undergo ideological transformation. In the process, it is necessary to check whether there are any landlords who have been missed in each village, whether the distribution of fruits is fair, how the families of martyrs and soldiers are being cared for, whether there are any cases of harming the interests of middle peasants, and appropriately resolve them. Currently, all county cadres are concentrating their efforts on this work.

　　隆平查减结束
    转入思想教育
    【本报威县二十二日电】隆平查减胜利后，现正进行巩固工作。领导上提出进行思想教育，要使群众回想自己历史，从切身体验中，认清地主的剥削压迫，以及自己为啥穷，肯定跟着共产党走。时事方面使群众认识蒋介石在美帝国主义帮助下，不会讲和平，只有打退蒋贼的进攻，才能保住家乡和土地。并说明我们自卫战果及蒋军必败，奠定群众胜利信心。关于培养群众领袖，建立村小区农民领导组织，各村要从农妇会小组，自下而上深入酝酿，选举翻身英雄，选举小区农妇联合会委员，各村农妇委员为当然代表，每村三十名会员中可选一代表，由代表中选出小区委员。选举手续上要简单，仪式上要隆重。为保卫群众利益，各村要整理发展民兵，老民兵要进行思想改造。在进行工作中，要检查各村是否有遗漏地主，果实分配公否，烈抗属照顾如何，有无损害中农利益情形，并适当予以解决，现全县干部，正集中力量进行中。
