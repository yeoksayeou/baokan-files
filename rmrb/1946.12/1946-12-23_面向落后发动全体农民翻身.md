　　Launch the Overturn of All Farmers for the Sake of Backwardness
　　To pour out grievances is an old issue, but in today's rent reduction and check-up and overturn movement, various places have emphasized its re-emergence, which has a new meaning and is also a new symbol of the deepening of mass movements.
　　The backward masses left over from the mass movements over the years, either have not fully poured out their grievances, or have not said a word at all, and therefore some have not yet overturned, or only "overturned half a body." These people are the mass base for today's emphasis on pouring out grievances.
　　Some comrades believe that "after the mass movements over the years, the grievances of the masses have been poured out," but the facts in various places prove that this argument is one-sided. In Licheng, in the rent reduction in 1944, ideological mobilization was done relatively well, but in this year's rent reduction, Zhang Shiqin, a hired worker in Xiwu Village, only now revealed the pain of his thirty years of hired labor. There are similar examples in Dongbaiyu. And Taiyue has found "people who do not say a word" in many areas. Therefore, ignoring pouring out grievances in this year's rent reduction means not facing this quite large portion of the backward masses.
　　Mobilizing backward farmers and finally completely eliminating feudalism is the key to deepening mass movements. Now, the news from Mazhuang, Wu'an, reported in Japanese newspapers, shows that they discovered the landlords' deception of the peasants from the backward farmers, and discovered the old roots of seven hired households who had not overturned for several years. There were problems they dared not raise in the past, and thus the whole village is brewing a thorough struggle against the landlords and bullies. The masses' awareness is also further improved on the basis of pouring out grievances. There are many similar examples in other places. Preliminary experience in various places has already proved that: paying attention to mobilizing backward farmers and promoting the masses to go deeper can truly consolidate the overturn of all farmers.

### 面向落后发动全体农民翻身

　　面向落后发动全体农民翻身
    诉苦是一个老问题，但在今天的查减与检查翻身运动中，各地又强调提出，却有它的新意义，同时也是群运深入的一个新标志。
    历年群运中遗留的落后层群众，或则苦水未诉尽，或则根本没吭气，因而有的还没翻身，或仅仅“翻了半个身”，这部分人，就是今天提出诉苦的群众基础。
    有的同志认为“经过历年群运，群众苦水已经倒尽”，但各地事实证明这一论点是片面的。黎城在一九四四年的查减中，思想发动是做得比较好的县份，但今年查减中，西仵村雇工张石琴，才吐诉出三十年来雇工生活的痛苦。东柏峪也有类似的例子。而太岳则在不少地区发现“不吭气的人”。因此，在今年查减中忽视诉苦，就是没有面向这部分相当众多的落后层群众。
    发动落后农民，最后彻底消灭封建，是群运深入的关键。如今日本报所载武安马庄的消息，他们从落后农民中发现了地主对农民的欺骗，发现了七户雇工几年来没有翻身的老穷根，是有问题过去不敢提，从而全村酝酿进行对地主恶霸的彻底斗争，群众觉悟也在诉苦的基础上更加提高。其他各地类此的例子还很多，各地初步经验已经证明：注意发动落后农民，推动群众走向深入，才能真正巩固全体农民的翻身。
