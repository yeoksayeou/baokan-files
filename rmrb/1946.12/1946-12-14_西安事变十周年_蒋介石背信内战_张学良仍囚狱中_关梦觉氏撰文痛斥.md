Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th: Guan Mengjue, one of the heads of the Northeast General Branch of the China Democratic League and currently the Director of the Education Department of the Nenjiang Provincial Government, recently wrote an article commemorating the "Double Twelfth" Incident, stating: "'Double Twelfth' teaches the Chinese people that they need to muster strength. The more power the people have, the more they can force the Kuomintang reactionaries to submit. The reason Chiang Kai-shek reluctantly participated in the War of Resistance against Japan that year was forced by the power of the people." Guan Mengjue, looking back at the past and comparing it to the present, said: Today, under new historical conditions, Chiang Kai-shek is retracing his old path of ten years ago—selling out the country, engaging in civil war, and practicing dictatorship. Today, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has become the enemy of the people of the whole country. When he talked about Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, the executors of the military remonstrance in the "Xi'an Incident," he said: "They were promoters of the War of Resistance and benefactors of Chiang Kai-shek, but Chiang Kai-shek betrayed his trust and imprisoned them for ten years. The people of the whole country have continuously demanded the release of General Zhang Xueliang to lead the War of Resistance, but Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly attempted to surrender, preparing to cede the Northeast as a generous gift to the Japanese invaders." Guan also appealed on behalf of the people of the Northeast: "Demand the release of General Zhang Xueliang, stop Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war; demand peaceful democratic construction, demand a life of peace and prosperity." Finally, he pointed out: "Only if we grit our teeth, work hard, and smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive can the above goals be achieved."

    西安事变十周年
    蒋介石背信内战
    张学良仍囚狱中
    关梦觉氏撰文痛斥
    【新华社东北十一日电】民盟东北总支部负责人之一，现任嫩江省政府教育厅长关梦觉，顷为文纪念“双十二”事变称：“‘双十二’对于中国人民的教训，那就是需要拿出力量来。人民愈有力量，就愈能迫使国民党反动派就范，当年蒋介石之所以半推半就地参加了抗战，就是人民的力量硬逼出来的”。关氏抚今追昔的说：今天蒋介石在新的历史条件之下，重走其十年的旧路——卖国，内战，独裁，今天蒋介石集团已成全国人民公敌。他在谈到“西安事变”中兵谏的执行者张学良杨虎城两将军时称：“他们是抗战的推行者，是蒋介石的恩人，但蒋介石却背信忘义把他们幽囚了十年，全国人民不断要求释放张学良将军出来领导抗战，但蒋介石却屡次企图投降，准备把东北作为一份厚礼割送日寇”。关氏并为东北人民呼吁：“要求释放张学良将军，制止蒋介石独裁内战；要求和平民主建设，要求安居乐业”。最后他指出：“只有我们咬紧牙根艰苦奋斗，粉碎蒋介石的进攻，上述目的才能达到”。
