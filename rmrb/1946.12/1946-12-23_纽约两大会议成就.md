　　Achievements of the Two Major Conferences in New York

　　The two major conferences held in New York over the past two months—the first session of the United Nations General Assembly and the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference—have recently concluded. After many struggles and twists and turns, the two conferences finally reached agreements on many important issues and achieved significant accomplishments. The Foreign Ministers Conference completed the final review of the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, resolving the three major issues that had been in dispute for fifteen months: the Trieste issue, reparations, and Danube River navigation. The United Nations General Assembly adopted the disarmament principles proposed by the Soviet delegation, resolved to establish an international supervision system for universal disarmament, and adopted resolutions such as recalling ambassadors stationed in Franco's Spain and prohibiting Franco's Spain from participating in UN agencies and activities, taking the first step in the UN's sacred work of maintaining democratic peace, eradicating fascist remnants, and stopping aggression. These brilliant achievements of the two conferences are in line with the aspirations of the people of the world and greatly inspire the determination of the people of the world to fight for peace and democracy.

　　Why were the two conferences able to achieve these accomplishments?

　　First, the US authorities' policy of seeking world hegemony suffered a serious setback, falling into a state of isolation. Faced with numerous difficulties, the US authorities were eager to seek compromise. Looking back to the beginning of this year, the US authorities' slogan of "getting tough on the Soviet Union" created obstacles at international conferences (such as the Paris Conference), doing its utmost to hinder the agreement on peace treaties. The United States believed that this approach could divert the attention of the world from its expansionist policy, so that it could freely invade China, and even capitalist countries such as Britain; secondly, it could strike at the international prestige of the Soviet Union, attempting to force the Soviet Union to make concessions. But the wishful thinking of US imperialism has failed. First, from the Paris Conference to the two major conferences in New York, the prestige and status of the Soviet Union has been further enhanced, while the US side has become more isolated. Second, the contradictions between Britain and the United States have become increasingly apparent, while British-Soviet relations have improved. Third, the movement of the American people and a section of the bourgeoisie against the current foreign policy of the US authorities has grown even further (such as the Wallace affair, etc.). Especially important, the US economic panic is about to arrive soon. If US-Soviet relations are not improved, the United States will not be able to increase trade with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. And today, increasing trade with these countries is precisely an important method urgently needed by the US authorities to delay or mitigate economic panic. This is the basic reason why the US authorities are eager to seek compromise and adopt a different attitude at the New York conference than at the Paris Conference.

　　Another important factor determining the success of the conference is the strength of the Soviet Union and its unwavering stance, and its efforts to serve as the cornerstone of world peace and democracy. Whether inside or outside the conference, the Soviet Union unswervingly adhered to and implemented the line of "believing in the desire and necessity of cooperation between the major powers that jointly won the war, believing in the desire and necessity of peaceful competition between different social and political systems, and believing in the necessity of recognizing the young democratic countries born in Eastern Europe and the Balkans," to oppose another line, namely, the line of "attempting to establish their rule over the world by using political pressure to treat equal countries, and by using military penetration and economic expansion" (Manuilsky). The Soviet delegation proposed universal disarmament, severing relations with fascist Spain, investigating the stationing of troops in non-enemy countries, that trusteeships should move towards independence, and questioned the continued stationing of US troops in China. These proposals were put forward so righteously that they aroused enthusiastic support from the people of the world, and even the representatives of the US government did not dare to oppose them head-on, and even American newspapers could not but admit that "the United States has lost" in the face of the Soviet Union's prestige. It is precisely because the Soviet representatives received widespread sympathy and support inside and outside the conference, and put forward constructive plans that could enable agreements with various countries, that the two conferences were able to achieve remarkable success. The Soviet Union's role as the mainstay of the world's peace and democracy cause has never been more clearly demonstrated in the two conferences.

　　Finally, the growth of the world's peace and democracy forces played an important role in the success of the conference. In particular, the people of Britain and France are increasingly leaning to the left, and are gradually exerting a powerful influence on the foreign policies of their respective authorities. Forty-one percent of British Labour Party members of Parliament opposed Bevin's reactionary policy. In the elections to the French National Assembly and Senate, the Communist Party, the vanguard of the democratic forces, won first place. These directly affected the attitudes of the representatives of Britain and France attending the conference, and enhanced the relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Clearly, such as at the United Nations General Assembly, France and the Soviet Union were in complete agreement on the issue of investigating foreign stationed troops and the World Federation of Trade Unions. On the issue of investigating domestic troops should include investigating weapons and establishing an international supervision system, Britain and the Soviet Union were in agreement. On the issue of resolving that countries should recall their ambassadors stationed in Spain, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union were in agreement, and the United States was completely isolated.

　　In this way, the achievements of the two major conferences in New York overwhelmed the clamor of the American imperialist elements and their partners' anti-UN line, and shattered their conspiracy to isolate the Soviet Union and split the peace and democracy forces; dealt a heavy blow to the anti-Soviet and anti-communist counter-current launched by international reactionaries since February of this year, and added another cornerstone to the cause of world peace and democracy. This is a great success for the people of the world, and it further confirms the brilliant truth of Comrade Mao Zedong's statement that "the people will win the war, and will win peace, and win progress." After this conference, after the signing of the five-nation peace treaty, although the review of European issues still requires a lot of debate and twists and turns, it will certainly be resolved like the five-nation peace treaty, which can be predicted.

　　The achievements of the two major conferences in New York once again prove that the cause of world peace and democracy will inevitably triumph, and the expansionist policy of US imperialism will inevitably fail. This is a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are opposing Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship and civil war and striving for independence, peace, and democracy. In addition, this United Nations General Assembly has taught the Chinese people a lesson. The representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek government relied on the United States everywhere in the conference, insulting the honor of our motherland. When representatives of other countries accused the United States of illegally stationing troops in China, he defended his "father," saying that the US military was stationed in China with the "consent of the Chinese government." When the conference discussed that Franco's Spain was endangering peace and should sever relations with it, he came out to deny and oppose it, willingly becoming Franco's partner. The Chinese people resolutely do not recognize this group of traitorous representatives! Only when the Chinese people's own representatives attend international conferences can they shoulder the solemn tasks that a great country should bear in the United Nations. (December 20)

### 纽约两大会议成就

　　纽约两大会议成就
    两月来在纽约先后召开的两大会议——联合国首届大会和四强外长会议，最近都闭幕了。两大会议经历了许多斗争与波折，终于在许多重要问题上成立协议，获得了重大的成就。外长会议完成了意、罗、匈、保、芬五国和约的最后审定工作，解决了十五个月来争执不休的三大问题，即的里雅斯特问题、赔款问题、和多瑙河通航问题。联合国大会通过了苏联代表团所建议的裁军原则，决议建立普遍裁减武装的国际监督制度，通过了各国召回驻佛朗哥西班牙的使节，禁止佛朗哥西班牙参加联合国机构与活动等项决议，迈开了联合国神圣工作——维持民主和平、铲除法西斯残余、制止侵略的第一步。两大会议的这些光辉成就，符合于全世界人民的愿望，并大大兴奋了全世界人民为和平民主而奋斗的胜利决心。
    两大会议为什么能获得这些成就呢？
    首先，美国当局要独霸世界的政策遭受了严重的挫折，陷入孤立的境地。美国当局在困难重重的情况下，急于求取妥协。回溯今年初以来，美当局“对苏强硬”的口号，在国际会议（如巴黎会议）上横生枝节，尽力阻碍和约达成协议。美国自以为这种做法一则可以转移世界各国对其扩张政策的注意，以便放手侵略中国，甚至于英国等资本主义国家；二则可以打击苏联的国际威信，企图逼迫苏联让步。但是美帝国主义的如意算盘都落空了。第一，从巴黎会议到纽约两大会议，苏联的威信和地位更加提高了，而美方则更形孤立。第二，英美矛盾日趋明显，而英苏关系则有改进。第三，美国人民和一部分资产阶级反对美国当局现行外交政策的运动，更加增长（如华莱士事件等等）。尤其重要的，美国经济恐慌不久即将到来。美苏关系如不改善，美国对苏联及东南欧的新民主国家即无法增进贸易。而今天增进对这些国家的贸易，恰恰是美国当局所迫切需要的延缓或减轻经济恐慌的重要方法。这就是美当局急于求取妥协，在纽约会议上采取和巴黎会议不同态度的基本原因。
    决定会议获得成就的另一重要因素，就是苏联的强大及其坚定不移的立场，和努力作为全世界和平民主的柱石。苏联无论在会内或会外，都毫不动摇地坚持与贯彻“相信共同赢得战争的大国之间合作的愿望及其必要，相信不同社会及政治制度和平竞赛的愿望及其必要，相信承认东欧及巴尔干诞生的年青民主国之必要”的路线，来反对另一条路线，即“企图以使用政治压力对待平等国家的办法，以军事上的伸入、经济上的扩张办法来建立他们对世界的统治”的路线（曼努意斯基）。苏联代表团建议了普遍裁军，与法西斯西班牙绝交，建议了调查各国在非敌国驻军，托管的应走向独立，并质问美军继续驻华。这些建议提得这样理直气壮，引起全世界人民的热烈拥护，连美政府的代表都不敢正面反对，甚至美国报纸也不能不承认在苏联的威望前面“美国是输了”。正因为苏联代表获得了会内外的广泛同情和支持，并提出了能使与各国获得协议的建设性的方案，两大会议才能得到显著的成就。苏联对于世界和平民主事业的中坚作用，在两大会议中表现得再明显也没有了。
    最后，全世界和平民主力量的增涨，对会议的获得成就起了重要的作用。特别是英、法两国人民日益左倾，对其本国当局的外交政策逐渐地发生有力的影响。英国工党议员中，有百分之四十一反对贝文的反动政策。在法国国民议会与参院选举中，民主势力的先锋队共产党荣膺第一位。这些，都直接影响到英、法参加会议的代表的态度，增进了英、法、苏的关系。明明白白地，如在联合国大会上，关于调查国外驻军和世界职工联盟问题，法、苏完全一致。在调查国内军队应包括调查武器，并建立国际监督制度问题上，英、苏一致。在决议各国召回驻西班牙使节问题上，英、法、苏一致，美国完全孤立。
    这样，纽约的两大会议的成就，压倒了美国帝国主义分子及其伙伴的反联合国路线的叫嚣，粉碎了他们孤立苏联与分裂和平民主势力的阴谋；使今年二月以来国际反动派所掀起的反苏反共逆流受了沉重的打击，使世界和平民主事业又多一块基石。这是全世界人民的大成功，这更证实毛泽东同志所说的“人民将赢得战争，并将赢得和平，赢得进步”的光辉真理。经过这次会议，五国和约签订后，审定欧洲问题虽然还须经过不少争论和曲折，但是一定能如五国和约一样获得解决，这是可以预言的。
    纽约两大会议的成就，再次证明世界和平民主事业必然胜利，美帝国主义的扩张政策必然失败。这对于正在反对蒋介石卖国独裁内战、争取独立和平民主的中国人民，是一个极大的鼓励。除此以外，这次联合国大会又为中国人民上了一课。蒋介石政府的代表，在大会中处处仰承美国的鼻息，污辱了我们祖国的荣誉。当别国代表指责美国非法在华驻军的时候，他却为他“爸爸”辩护，说美军驻华经“中国政府同意”。大会讨论佛朗哥西班牙危害和平应与之绝交的时候，他竟出来否认和反对，甘当佛朗哥的伙伴。中国人民坚决不承认这批卖国的代表！只有当中国人民自己的代表出席国际会议的时候，才能担负起一个伟大国家在联合国中应负的庄严任务。（十二月二十日）
