　　Pseudo-National Assembly Tests Political Integrity
　　Zeng Qi, Zhang Junmai Clownishly Seek Attention, While Leaders of the Democratic League Display Admirable Integrity
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th] Whether or not to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's "National Assembly" has become a test of character for political figures who participated in the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) in January this year. Although participating in the illegal pseudo-"National Assembly" is an open betrayal of the PCC and a sell-out of democracy, the temptation to gain scraps from Chiang Kai-shek's small court still drives unprincipled and hypocritical people to seek the stench in that abalone market. In early November, the Democratic League, social elites, PCC representatives, the Democratic Socialist Party led by Zhang Junmai (including the traitor Tang ＠ming faction), and the Youth Party led by the traitor Zeng Qi, all announced their adherence to the PCC resolutions. However, on the 12th, Chiang Kai-shek meaninglessly postponed the "National Assembly" for three days, and some so-called "elites" actually discovered some kind of "significance" in this meaninglessness. They sold the political titles that allowed them to be called "elites," thus becoming their own "elites." Although the public had long predicted that the Youth Party, which depended on Kuomintang subsidies for its existence, would inevitably participate in Chiang's "National Assembly," the Party's Tenth Central Committee, Second Plenary Session, still had to feign a "determination to uphold the spirit of the PCC resolution" on the 5th of this month. They even dragged out this tiresome act until the 14th, the eve of the opening of Chiang's "National Assembly," when the mask was suddenly torn off, and the Party, as expected, submitted its list.
    Youth Party spokesman Zuo Shunsheng did not dare to deny that they themselves had committed a crime, but asked that the issue of merit and demerit be "judged by contemporary elites and world historians." Li Huang, a member of the Party's Central Committee, "disappeared" from Shanghai on the 17th after returning from Nanjing. Zhang Junmai, the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, who was known as "Zeng Qi the Second," was in even more distress at this crucial moment. Although Zhang himself and his comrades, including the traitor Tang ＠ming and his group, were very enthusiastic about the honor of "those who listen to Chiang Kai-shek's speech are all reactionaries" (New York Tribune), they wrote to Chiang Kai-shek on the 20th, guaranteeing that the Party would support Chiang's complete betrayal of the PCC resolutions in exchange for Chiang's "complete implementation of the PCC resolutions." However, respected leaders within the Democratic Socialist Party firmly opposed Zhang's unprincipled behavior, believing that participating in the "National Assembly" was tantamount to a respectable woman falling into a fire pit, inevitably leading to ruin and disgrace. In this tense "battle between heaven and man," Zhang finally submitted a list representing political integrity to Chiang Kai-shek on the 23rd, merely maintaining a @mother-like annotation: "But declaring that when the draft constitution is discussed, he will be happy to explain or participate in opinions if needed by any party." When Li Huang "disappeared," there were also rumors that Zhang had "disappeared." Shanghai newspapers headlined Li, Zhang, and Zhang Jie, the "bad egg" who simultaneously disappeared due to drug addiction, as "Three Disappearances in One Day," saying that Zhang Jie "is, after all, a clown, and even his disappearance has to join in the fun." A Nanjing newspaper said: "Zhang Junmai's 'Mai' is often mistaken for 'Li,' but in fact, this character is homophonous with the character 'sell.'"
    In contrast to the above three types of people, the Democratic League, chaired by Zhang Lan, issued a statement on the 12th, refusing to participate in the "National Assembly" that violated the PCC. On the 24th, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and Zhang Shenfu, the heads of the Democratic League in Beijing, also issued a lengthy written statement to reporters, stating the Democratic League's solemn position of adhering to the PCC resolutions. According to the Shanghai United Evening News on the 20th: "A leader of the Democratic League said that now is the time to pan for gold in the sand. The people should follow the gold, not the sand. Yes, true gold is not afraid of fire. Recent events are deeply moving. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Labor Association, quietly left the country, Zhang Dongsun resolutely expressed his firm stance, and Huang Renzhi roamed the lake (referring to West Lake in Hangzhou), reciting the line: 'Only worry about taking dreams to Huangtai.' Guo Moruo sent Luo Longji an invitation to visit Yandang Mountain. These few clearly show their proud and heroic姿态, which is in stark contrast to the lively scene in the National Assembly hall. How clear is the test of history!"
    In addition to the leaders of various parties and factions of the Democratic League, certain democratic leaders within the Democratic Socialist Party, and social elites and PCC representatives such as Guo Moruo, respected democratic leaders within the Kuomintang also did not participate in the "National Assembly." Zhu Xuefan, whom I met in Hong Kong, is one of them.

### 伪国大考验政治人格　曾琦张君劢小丑逐臭民盟诸领袖气节可风

　　伪国大考验政治人格
  　曾琦张君劢小丑逐臭民盟诸领袖气节可风
    【新华社延安二十九日电】拒绝参加蒋介石的“国大”与否，对于曾参加今年一月政治协商会议的政治人物，已成为一个人格的考试。虽然参加非法的伪“国大”就公开背叛政协、出卖民主，但是在蒋介石的小朝廷中讨一点剩饭残羹的诱惑，仍然驱使无气节与伪善之徒，到那个鲍鱼之肆去逐臭。在十一月初民主同盟、社会贤达、政协代表、张君劢所领导的民主社会党，（包括汉奸汤＠铭一派）以及汉奸曾琦所领导的青年党，都曾宣布信守政协决议，但到十二日，蒋介石毫无意义的将“国大”延期三天，若干所谓“贤达”竟从毫无意义之中发现了什么“国大”的意义似的，出卖了使他们得以名为“贤达”的政治头衔，成了自己的“贤达”。舆论界虽早已预料依靠国民党津贴存在的青年党必然参加蒋记“国大”，但该党十届二中全会在本月五日仍不能不伪装“决定一本政协决议之精神”，甚至将这个无聊的撒娇一直熬到十四日，即蒋记“国大”开幕的前夜，面幕忽然撕下，该党果如预料交了名单。
    青年党发言人左舜生不敢否认他们自己是犯了罪，但要求将功罪问题“听诸当代贤达及世史家之公断”，该党中委李璜则于十七日由京返沪“失踪”。被称为“曾琦第二”的民主社会党领袖张君劢，在这天人交战关头，比青年党更为狼狈。虽然张氏本人及他的同志汉奸汤＠铭等一群十分热中于“听蒋介石演说的都是反动分子”（纽约论坛报语）的光荣，因而，在二十日致函蒋介石，保证该党拥护蒋之彻底背叛政协决议，以换取蒋之“彻底实现政协决议”。但民社党内有威信的领袖，则均坚决反对张氏的无气节行为，认为参加“国大”，无异良家女子堕入火坑，必致身败名裂。在此种紧张的“天人交关”，张氏终于二十三日向蒋介石提出代表政治节操的名单，仅仅保持＠母式的注语：“但声明讨论宪草时，无论任何方面如需要君劢说明或参加意见，无不乐从。”张氏在李璜“失踪”时亦曾传说“失踪”，沪报以李张加上同时以吸毒失踪的“坏蛋仕角”章杰直，标题为：“一日三失踪”，说章“究竟是小丑，失踪也要凑热闹。”南京某报则称：“张君劢的劢常误为励，其实这字是和‘卖’字同音的”。
    与上述三种人相反，张澜为主席的民主同盟，于十二日发表声明，不参加违反政协的“国大”，廿四日民盟在京负责人罗隆基、章伯钧、张申府招待记者时，又发表长篇书面谈话，表明民盟信守政协决议的严正立场。据二十日上海联合晚报称：“民盟某领袖说，目前正是沙里淘金之时，人民当随金子走，决不会随沙子走。是的，真金决不怕火炼，看最近的情形，令人万分感慨。劳协理事长朱学范悄然出国了，张东荪断然作了坚毅的表示，黄任之则遨游湖上（按指杭州西湖），高吟：“只愁抱梦到黄台”之句，郭沫若对罗隆基传有游雁荡之约，这几位显然连引的傲骨英姿，正和国大会场内的一片热闹成了显著的对照。历史的考验是何其分明”！
    除民主同盟各党派领袖民主社会党内某些民主领袖及郭沫若等社会贤达政协代表外，国民党内有威信的民主派领袖亦均未参加“国大”，在香港遇到的朱学范氏即其中之一。
