Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 6th: Since July and up to mid-September, over 1,500 Yan's troops in Xin County deserted, among them over 900 soldiers carried away more than 230 rifles, 5 small cannons and 12 machine guns returning to their hometowns in liberated areas such as Guoxian County. The Yan's troops' Security Regiment 12 shrank from more than 700 men to 250, and one company of the 71st division went from 120 men to 80. In late October, the 71st division harassed the liberated areas of Dingxiang and Yuanping once, and 300 men deserted. The Yan's troops are circulating titles such as "Air Force Squad Leader" [meaning deserters]. According to Liu Baozi, a deserter from the 9th company of the 3rd battalion of the 97th regiment: "In order to prevent desertion, Yan Xishan ordered his troop commanders to shoot deserters who were caught, and implemented a 'three-man joint guarantee' (if one person escapes, the other two will be killed), but soldiers are still deserting in groups with their weapons."

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 5th: Yan's army's secret publication "Iron Blood Soul" issue 17 published Yan Xishan's instructions from September 27th, stating that his troops "are not good enough as soldiers, and the units are not good enough as units, and they are helpless when they see the enemy (referring to the Eighth Route Army)". When he reviewed the 3rd regiment of the 39th division during the battle of Hongdong Zhaocheng, he said: "Soldiers (referring to Yan's troops) don't know how to use bayonets when charging, and they don't know how to throw hand grenades... they are flustered when they encounter battle." The Yan army officers are also full of war-weariness. When Wang Jingguo, Commander-in-Chief of the Sixth Army Group, convened officers above the company level in Linfen in early September to deploy a "burn the boats" civil war plan, Kang Shangxun, the political director of the 69th Division, and the directors of nine regiments were absent without reason, angering Wang Jingguo to the point of roaring: "This is a deliberate avoidance of combat." But Wang Jingguo also said despondently: "We always lose battles, which makes cowardice exist in the troops, and there is really no hope of winning battles."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 4th: The Shanghai Shanxi Guild Hall issued a declaration on its tenth anniversary, demanding that the Kuomintang authorities remove Yan Xishan from the position of Provincial Chairman. Yan has occupied Shanxi for more than 30 years, Yan Xishan's administration is corrupt and implements reactionary policies (including retaining more than 100,000 Japanese troops and 200,000 puppet troops), and his "security forces" are waging civil war against the Communist army.

　　阎军士气日益低落纷纷拖枪逃解放区
  　高级军官怠战王靖国哀叹
    【新华社晋绥六日电】忻县阎军自七月至九月中旬逃亡达一千五百余人，内有九百余人携带步枪二百三十余支，小炮五门、机枪十二挺、返回崞县等解放区家乡。阎军保安十二团由七百余人减至二百五十人，团十师一个连由一百二十人减少到八十人，七十一师于十月下旬向定襄原平解放区进扰一次，即逃亡三百人。阎军中流行着“空军班长”等称号。据九十七团三营九连逃兵刘保子称：“阎锡山为防止逃亡，下令其部队长官枪杀抓回之逃兵，并实行‘三人连环保’（一人逃跑其余两人遭杀）但士兵仍结伙拖枪逃跑。”
    【新华社晋绥五日电】阎军秘密刊物“铁血魂”十七期刊载阎锡山九月二十七日指示称：其部队“军人不够军人，部队不够部队，一见敌人（指八路军）就没办法”。他于检讨三十九师三团在洪洞赵城作战时称：“士兵（指阎军）每到冲锋，有刺刀不知道上，有手榴弹不知道放，………一遇战斗，手忙脚乱”。阎军长官亦充满怠战情绪，第六集团军总司令王靖国于九月初在临汾召集连级以上军官，布置“破釜沉舟”的内战计划时，六十九师政治主任康商勋及九个团主任即无故不到会，气得王靖国大发雷霆骂道：“这是故意躲避作战”。可是王靖国也丧气的说：“我们老是打败仗，使部队中存在懦种，实在永无打胜仗的希望”。
    【新华社延安六日电】据合众社上海四日讯：上海山西会馆于其十周年纪念日发表宣言，要求国民党当局撤去阎锡山省主席之职。阎氏之盘踞山西已三十余年，阎锡山行政腐败与执行反动的政策（包括保留十余万日军二十万伪军），他的“治安军”正在对中共军进行内战。
