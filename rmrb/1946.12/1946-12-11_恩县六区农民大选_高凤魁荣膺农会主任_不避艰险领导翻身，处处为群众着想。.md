[Report from our Jinnan correspondent] After the great land reform movement in the Sixth District of En County, a district-wide farmers' election was promptly held. Farmer leader Gao Fengkui was elected director of the Sixth District Farmers' Association with 225 votes. Before the election, there was extensive deliberation within the farmers' association groups in each village. At a group discussion, an old man named Li from Gao Village said, "When electing a district leader, we must think carefully!" Finally, he put forward three conditions: (1) Someone who won't let the people suffer; (2) Someone who can do good things for the people; (3) Someone who has some prestige among the people in our district. So everyone discussed "Who is suitable?" Liu Shushan, a 70-year-old man, said, "My family's life has improved, and I'm about to get another cow. If it weren't for Gao Fengkui, how could I have this today?" Feng Xun said, "I will never forget Gao Fengkui. I didn't have money to buy a cow, and he lent it to me. I used to have four people farming two and a half mu of land. Now I have enough for eighteen mu. Next year, when the grain is harvested, we'll have enough to eat. Even if I die, my family is guaranteed not to go hungry!" Then he asked his child, "Son! Son! What did you eat in the past?" The child recalled the tragic life of the past and cried. Wu Xun also said with tears in his eyes, "If there is the Eighth Route Army, there is me. Now Chiang Kai-shek is trying to seize our country. Although I am forty-two years old, my husband who joined the army is still capable!" Liu Jiangbin said, "Our emancipation is due to the leadership of Chairman Mao above, and we also need Gao Fengkui to handle affairs for us below!" Then someone said, "Gao Fengkui lets others pick the fruit first when distributing it." Another said, "He handles official business and also does work. He runs around outside, and when he gets home, he still gins cotton." At the representative meeting of more than 360 people in the district, Xu Zhaofu, the representative of Santang Village, said, "Gao Fengkui also helped our village to emancipate. He not only led several villages to emancipate, but he also came up with the idea of ​​planting wheat in each village. He doesn't eat or spend anything himself, he works outside, and when he comes home, he still produces. On the fifth day of the lunar month, he only came home for half a day in the evening, and he ginned 140 jin of cotton in one night, earning a net profit of 3,500 yuan." Later, in the group discussions, four of the seven sub-districts proposed electing Gao Fengkui. Gao Fengkui was then honorably elected.

    【本报冀南讯】恩县六区翻身大检查运动过后，随即进行全区农民大选举，农民领袖高凤魁以二二五票当选为六区农会主任。选举前，在各村农会小组内普遍的酝酿。在小组讨论会上，高庄有个李老头说：“推选全区领袖，得老实寻思寻思！”最后他提出了三个条件：（一）不给老百姓气受的；（二）能给老百姓办好事的；（三）得在咱区老百姓里有点威望的。于是大家就讨论“选谁合适”？七十岁的老者刘树山说：“我家日子上升了，又要闹上一个牛，要不是高凤魁那能有现在？”冯勋说：“到死也忘不了高凤魁，我买牛没钱人家借给我，从前我四口人种二亩半地，现在我够了十八亩，明年打了粮食就能够吃，即便我死了，一家子保险挨不了饿！”随着就问他的小孩：“儿！儿！你往年吃的什么？”小孩回想起过去的悲惨生活，呜呜的哭起来。呜勋也含着泪说：“有八路军就有我，现在老蒋夺咱们的天下，我虽然四十二岁了，参军的丈夫还行！”刘姜宾说：“咱们翻身上边有毛主席的领导，下边还得有高凤魁给咱办事！”接着这个说：“人家高凤魁分果实别人挑了才要。”那个说：“又办公事又做活，在外跑回家还轧花。”在全区三百六十多人的代表大会上，三教堂的代表徐兆福说：“高凤魁还帮着俺村翻身，他不光领导俺几个村翻身，他还打主意叫俺各村都能种上麦子，他自己不吃不花在外作工作回家还是生产，初五那天他半天夕回家，一晚轧了一百四十斤花，净赚三千五百元。”以后在小组讨论中七个小区有四个小区提议选举高凤魁。高凤魁遂光荣当选。
