　　[Changzhi News] In Bo'ai, behind enemy lines under Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime, the people have universally launched struggles against traitors, spies, and local bullies, as well as struggles against the "reverse settlement" of accounts. Gao Chuntao, a major local tyrant in Xuwan Village, Seventh District, has consistently oppressed the masses and committed all kinds of evil deeds. This past August, the masses in the village settled accounts with him. At that time, he spread rumors to intimidate the masses, saying, "Don't quarrel, don't make trouble, wait and see the excitement on the fifteenth of August." (meaning a change of regime) When the Chiang army attacked, he threatened the masses, organized maintenance, and then directly surrendered to the enemy, forcing the masses to return the fruits of the revolution. On the 20th of last month, the masses captured Gao, the traitor, alive when he returned to the village and killed him on the spot. The masses happily said, "With no bad people in the village, the people can live in peace." Following this, the masses in villages such as Fangshan, Chapeng, and Dadi also uncovered cases of special agents organizing riots and attempting to kill the masses. Recently, the masses in Beishizi, Second District, also killed the special agent Liu Chenggong, who relied on the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime to kill our cadres and militiamen. The masses in Yangmiao killed Yang Fengwu, the head of the puppet Yangmiao Township Self-Defense Corps. This traitor was a notorious black gunner. After our liberation of Bo'ai last year, he fled to Xinxiang. This time, he returned with the Chiang army and even more intensified his oppression of the masses. However, the resistance of the masses was even stronger, monitoring his actions day and night. On the 2nd of this month, the traitor returned to the village to extort money, and the masses ambushed him by the roadside, successfully capturing him and killing him on the spot with a homemade gun. The masses in the village are now more united, organizing self-defense, taking up homemade guns and cannons, and preparing for a final struggle against the traitors and bullies who come to oppress them again. After the above-mentioned traitors and bullies were punished by the masses, other traitors and bullies who attempted to "reverse the settlement" and "restore the old order" were greatly frightened and dared not return to the village casually.
