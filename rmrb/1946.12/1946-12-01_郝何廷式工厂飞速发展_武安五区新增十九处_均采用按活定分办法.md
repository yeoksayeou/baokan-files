　　Hao Heting-style Factories Rapidly Develop
  　Nineteen New Locations Added in the Fifth District of Wu'an, All Using the "Fixed Output, Divided Share" Method
    [Report from this newspaper in Wu'an] Following the county's Labor Hero Conference, small-scale textile factories in the style of Hao Heting have rapidly developed in the past half-month. In the eight villages including Naoshang in the Fifth District alone, nineteen factories have been established under the active leadership of the Women's Association and heroes. More than one hundred and forty women from Naoshang, Hulei Mountain, and Baoziyu have participated. In Baoziyu, under the leadership of the textile hero Gao Yun, the one group from last year has developed into four small factories, with sixty-four women participating, accounting for 60% of the women in the village. In Naoshang, under the leadership of Hao Heting, sixty women out of the village's ninety have been organized, and the factory has been divided into two from one. In addition to young and middle-aged people, a large number of elderly women, children, and disabled people have been recruited to participate in the factories. In Gao Yun's factory in Baoziyu, there are also thirteen people, including nine-year-old children and elderly women in their fifties and sixties. A twelve-year-old girl from Hulei Mountain, who was sent to her husband's family as a child bride due to poverty last year, returned home this year and participated in the factory. She can now spin four taels of cotton a day, earning one hundred yuan. After deducting forty yuan for food, she has sixty yuan left, escaping a life of poverty. After participating in the factories, the women were freed from the constraints of household chores. They worked together, competed with each other, and stayed close to the spinning wheels from early morning until late at night, greatly improving their spinning ability. In Baoziyu, one person spins an average of ten taels of cotton a day. In Gao Zhuan's small factory in Hulei Mountain, twenty workers spin eighteen catties of thread, averaging fourteen taels and four qian per person per day, creating the highest record for spinning cotton. Guo Ernu spins one catty of cotton and twists half a catty of thread a day. Since starting work on the eleventh of last month, Naoshang, Hulei Mountain, and Baoziyu have spun two hundred and thirty-five catties of thread and earned ninety-four thousand yuan in silver dollars. Each small factory has also developed a method of distributing shares based on work. Gao Yun's factory in Baoziyu stipulates that spinning ten taels of thread, twisting three catties of thread, weaving one zhang and two chi of cloth, and warping the cloth one day are all worth ten points. In Hulei Mountain Village, spinning half a catty of cotton and twisting the thread is worth ten points. In Naoshang Village, spinning half a catty of cotton, weaving one zhang and two chi of cloth, twisting two catties of thread, and winding @ one catty and a half are all worth ten points. The four factories in Baoziyu all cook together and have collectively researched a method of converting cooking into work points for spinning: cooking three meals a day and spinning four taels of cotton is worth ten points, while not cooking and spinning ten taels of cotton is worth ten points. In order to reduce bookkeeping troubles, the small factories in Hulei Mountain generally implement work tickets, issuing work tickets according to points per day and settling accounts once every seven days.
