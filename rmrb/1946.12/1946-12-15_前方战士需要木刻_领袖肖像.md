    Frontline Soldiers Need Woodcuts
    Portraits of Leaders
    According to a telegram from our newspaper's frontline reporter group: The New Year is approaching, and the soldiers on the front lines are eager to have portraits of the leaders. The Political Department will pay attention to this issue, but we suggest that woodcut artists should put in more effort on this specific matter. Please carve portraits of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Commander Liu, Chairman Yang, Political Commissar Deng, and other leaders into single prints the size of postcards. Printing plants can also design some lithographs. This matter is not big, and we believe that our artists can fulfill this need from the front lines beautifully and in a timely manner. Let's make a push!

    前方战士需要木刻
    领袖肖像
    据本报前方记者团来电说：新年快到了，前线战士们很想能有领袖们的画像。政治部将会注意这个问题的，但我们建议，木刻家们在这件具体事情上，应多出点力。请把毛主席、朱总司令、刘司令员、杨主席、邓政委等首长的肖像，刻制成明信片大小的单幅吧。印刷厂也可设计石印一些。这件事不大，想来我们的艺术家一定可以美满而及时地满足前方这个需要的。突击一下吧！
