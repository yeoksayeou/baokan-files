Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 5th: (Delayed dispatch) The "China Business Daily" in Hong Kong published an editorial on October 24th entitled "Protest Against Atrocities of US Troops Stationed in China," stating: "Even 'independent' Philippines still has tens of thousands of US troops stationed there, and the atrocities of US troops there are just like those in China. For example, US military vehicle accidents account for more than 50% of vehicle-related injuries, arousing the accusations of the Filipino people. But Philippine President Roxas still knows how to feign sincerity and protest to the US military authorities. In contrast, in our country, the people's grievances are everywhere, but Kuomintang officials shamelessly say that the US military is 'very good' and try to defend the atrocities of the US military in many ways." The newspaper called on all Chinese people who do not want to be colonial slaves to continue to accuse the US military's atrocities to the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 6th: According to the Beiping "New Life Daily" reports: Incidents of US military vehicles injuring people have occurred three times in recent days. One day at one o'clock in the morning, at Santiao, East Chang'an Avenue, a US military jeep sped by and knocked down a rickshaw puller, and the rickshaw was also destroyed. One day at six o'clock in the afternoon, Jiang Xiaofu, an apprentice at the Yuquan Restaurant on Qianmen Street, was knocked down by a US military vehicle, and immediately lost consciousness. The US vehicle then sped away. On the 29th, at three o'clock in the afternoon, at the east entrance of Dongjiaominxiang, US military jeep No. 908890 injured rickshaw puller Xue Wenxi, and the rickshaw was also damaged.

    香港华商报发表社论
    抗议驻华美军暴行
    北平美军车又伤人三起
    【新华社延安五日电】香港讯：（迟到）此间华商报曾于十月二十四日发表社论“抗议驻华美军暴行”称：“‘独立’以后的菲律滨还驻有数万美军，那儿美军的暴行也一如驻在中国的一样，例如美军车祸案占车辆伤人事件百分之五十以上，激起菲律滨人民的控诉。但菲总统罗哈斯还知道假猩猩地向美军当局提出抗议。反观我国，人民怨声四起，国民党官员却还无耻地说美军‘顶好’，并多方地替美军的暴行辩护。”该报呼吁不愿当殖民地奴隶的全中国人民要继续向全世界控诉美军的暴行。
    【新华社延安六日电】据北平新生报载：美军军车伤人事件近日连续发生三次。一日上午一时，东单北大街三条，有美军吉普车一辆风驶电掣将一洋车夫撞倒，洋车亦被撞毁。一日下午六时，前门大街有裕泉饭店学徒江筱甫被美军汽车撞倒，当即不省人事，美车则扬长驶去。二十九日下午三时，东交民巷东口有美军九○八八九○号吉普车将车敌夫薛文喜撞伤，洋车亦被撞坏。
