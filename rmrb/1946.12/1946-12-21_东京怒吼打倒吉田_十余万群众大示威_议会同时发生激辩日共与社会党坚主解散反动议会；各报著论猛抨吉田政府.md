　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Tokyo dispatch: On the morning of the 17th, over 100,000 Tokyo residents held a pre-arranged major demonstration against Yoshida. The angry masses broke through the heavily guarded lines of American troops – including tanks and cavalry – passed by the Parliament, the Prime Minister's official residence, and reached the square in front of the Imperial Palace, holding high banners and signs against Yoshida. Slogans resounded through the clouds. Three platforms were set up in the square, facing the gate of the Imperial Palace. Speakers put forward twenty-seven demands, including: overthrowing the Yoshida Cabinet, guaranteeing people's livelihood, raising wages, gender equality, establishing a democratic government, etc. Demonstrators sang revolutionary marches, accompanied by three large bands, creating an unprecedentedly magnificent momentum. Among many huge cartoons, the most eye-catching one depicted America's running dog, Yoshida, hanging on the gallows, with the title "The End of the Yoshida Cabinet." Tokyo's democratic newspapers all published articles that day attacking the reactionary and incompetent nature of the Yoshida Cabinet. In the parliament hall, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party jointly proposed a motion to dissolve the current reactionary parliament, engaging in fierce debate with the reactionaries, with shouts of condemnation and rallying cries mixing together, forming an unprecedentedly spectacular scene in Japanese history in harmony with the demonstration outside the parliament. Korean residents also participated in the major demonstration on the 17th. In pamphlets they distributed, they stated, "We deeply sympathize with you, let us join hands and fight together." "The interests of the people of Japan and Korea are consistent." According to reports, the demonstration in Tokyo on the 17th is only a corner of the nationwide anti-Yoshida demonstrations in Japan. This surging anti-Yoshida demonstration across the country was jointly initiated by the labor unions led by the Japanese Socialist and Communist Parties. Participants include workers, farmers, urban small property owners, and intellectuals. According to the initiators of the demonstration, the major demonstration on the 17th is only the beginning of the anti-Yoshida movement, and this movement will continue to persist until the people's demands are realized.
