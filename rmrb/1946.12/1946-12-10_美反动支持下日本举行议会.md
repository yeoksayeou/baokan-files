　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 7th: Comprehensive Tokyo news reports that amidst the rising tide of labor strikes and anti-Yoshida movements across Japan, the 91st session of the Japanese Parliament commenced in Tokyo on November 29th. Current indications suggest that the meeting is being manipulated by US and Japanese reactionaries to suppress the "labor offensive" and the influence of left-wing parties, and to stabilize Yoshida's position. On the 27th, when Yoshida delivered a speech in Parliament on the issue of Japan's economic recovery, he attributed the primary obstacle to Japan's economic recovery to workers' strikes, emphasizing that wages should not be increased, stating that this would further inflate Japan's currency. Yoshida's speech was fiercely criticized by various opposition parties, with Socialist Party Chairman Nishio directly demanding Yoshida's resignation. Yoshida responded with abusive language, saying, "Whether I resign or not is my business, you don't need to interfere." This led to commotion and insults in the chamber. Another farce was the stripping of the Japanese Communist Party of its only two seats on the Constitutional Draft and Budget Committees of Parliament. Regarding the above events, Tokyo observers commented that Yoshida is receiving direct support from the US occupation authorities. During the Japanese power workers' strike, the occupation authorities threatened workers that if they "obstructed the US military's occupation mission" by cutting off power, the US would arrest and severely punish them, which is proof of this support. As for the JCP being deprived of its seats on the parliamentary committees, observers pointed out that this more nakedly exposed the reactionary nature of the parliament in front of all the Japanese people.

　　美反动支持下日本举行议会
    【新华社延安七日电】综合东京消息，值全日工潮及反吉田运动蓬勃高涨之时，日本第九十一届议会于十一月二十九日起，在东京举行。迄今的征象已显示会议系在美日反动派一手操纵之下图谋打击“劳工攻势”及左翼政党的势力，稳定吉田地位。二十七日吉田在议会上演说日经济复兴问题时，将日本经济复兴的首要障碍归咎于工人的罢工，强调不能增加工资，说这会使日本通货愈加膨胀。吉田的演说遭到各反对党的猛烈抨击，社会党主席西尾直接要求吉田辞职，吉田恶语答称：“辞不辞是我的事，你不要管。”致有会场的骚动与对骂。另一幕丑剧为剥夺日共在议会宪草及预算委员会议仅有的两个席位。关于上述事件，东京观察家评称：吉田乃受到美占领当局的直接支持，日电力工人罢工时，占领当局曾威胁工人如以停电“妨碍美军占领任务”，美方将加逮捕并处予严厉处分即其佐证。至于日共之被剥夺议会委员会的席位，观察家指出：这更赤裸裸地在全日本人民面前暴露了议会的反动性。
