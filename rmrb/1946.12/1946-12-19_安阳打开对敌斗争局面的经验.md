Experiences in Opening Up the Struggle Against the Enemy in Anyang
　　Shi Hong
　　Anyang has initially created some valuable experiences in opening up the struggle against the enemy:
　　First, combine expressing attitudes to the masses with leaders personally taking action. After we withdrew from Shuiye, some cadres were ideologically confused, and the masses thought we had helped them up the ladder and then abandoned them. On the 7th, all county cadres gathered to study the current situation, clarify their minds, examine their thinking, and establish a victorious confidence in "ensuring the wheat harvest next year," and proposed resolutely carrying out the struggle against the enemy. Since the enemy occupied Guantai, the masses in the enemy-occupied areas have been loudly calling for help, and the militiamen have also been actively asking to go down, but because the enemy's paper tiger has not been broken, no one is willing to go down, so the enemy can still be rampant for a while. After the Leikou meeting on the 17th, it was loudly proposed: "Anyang cadres live and die with the people of Anyang," "Leaders take responsibility and personally take action." Immediately, County Head Ma Li, Civil Affairs Commissioner He Gao, and Director Xu Qian personally led the militia to attack the enemy and puppets, and went deep behind enemy lines, and the flames of guerrilla warfare spread throughout Anyang. From then on, the people were very happy and joined the ranks of revenge one after another, exploring news, sending intelligence, cooperating with the army and militia, and capturing special agents and traitors. They said: "You are here, and we have a way."
　　Second, the regular army supports and makes decisions. In the sharp frontal struggle in Nanling, a unit of the Anyang Regiment cooperated with the local militia to actively launch a struggle against the enemy, and entered deep behind enemy lines in big strides. As a result, not only were seventeen guerrilla area villages turned into base areas, but also eight villages in the enemy-occupied areas were recovered. At the same time, in order to create new base areas, twenty-four markets were opened on the edge of the enemy-occupied areas. Recently, the Beiling District has also made great progress due to the cooperation of the regular army.
　　Third, commend models, establish righteousness, and carry out a campaign to earn merit. In the most urgent situation of the war, they restored the Anyang small newspaper "Voice of the People." First, they issued a notice to commend Wang Juemin, the district chief of the Fifth District, who was not afraid of hardships and was still able to lead the militia to fight against the enemy while sick. They also published the good news that Anyang had surrounded and burned the Shiguang blockhouse, encouraging the militia to advance to the enemy's rear. When the four Beiling guerrilla groups entered the enemy's rear, they immediately published commendations, and when they achieved success in their activities, they not only published commendations, but also gave rewards according to the situation. For example, they first commended the Shuiye Lu Bingquan group for arresting the reactionary landlord at the Huaibei Pass, and the Hou Quan group not only captured the mother of a special agent captain in Xiguan, but also held a small mass meeting. The Zhang Deyi and Wang Jinxiao groups felt that if you dare to go at night, I dare to go during the day, so they captured a reactionary landlord in Nanguan on the afternoon of the 2nd, at which time the county headquarters gave a commendation. The Ji Guangli group even entered Xiguan on the morning of the 3rd and wounded an enemy sentry. The enemy bombarded him with machine guns and artillery, but he said, "Don't be afraid, go to Nanguan." Sure enough, they pasted the notice before returning safely. … In this way, not only was morale boosted, but also righteousness was promoted, and the demands for struggle against the enemy were raised step by step.
　　Fourth, frontal attacks must be closely combined with activities behind enemy lines. This combination not only allows us to find small, weak targets to eat, but also creates more conditions for us to eat. Obviously, if we had not launched a full-scale attack on the enemy and fought them in the rear, the blockhouses of Shijian, Shiguan, and Zi would not have been burned down so smoothly, and the enemy in Nanling would not have retreated dozens of villages. This is because we have contained the enemy on all sides, making it impossible for them to move freely and they have no choice but to endure or flee in a panic.

　　安阳打开对敌斗争局面的经验
    史洪
    安阳在打开对敌斗争的局面上，已初步创造了不小可贵的经验：
    第一、向群众表示态度与首长亲自动手相结合。我退出水冶后，少数干部思想有些紊乱，群众认为我们是把他们扶上杆不管了。七日，全县干部集会，学习时事，清醒头脑，检查思想，树立了“明年不误收麦”的胜利信心，提出坚决开展对敌斗争。自敌占据观台，敌占区群众已大声呼救，而民兵也积极要求下去，惟因敌人纸老虎未打破，谁也不肯下去，故敌仍能疯狂一时。经十七日磊口会议，始响亮提出：“安阳干部与安阳人民同生共死”、“首长负责，亲自动手”。遂即马力县长、何高民政委、徐前主任亲率民兵，出击敌伪，深入敌后，游击战争烽火遍燃安阳全境。从此，人心大快，纷纷卷入复仇行列，探消息、送情报、配合军队、民兵，捕捉特务汉奸。他们说：你们来了，我们就有办法了。
    第二、正规军撑腰作主。在南岭正面斗争尖锐，安阳团一部配合当地民兵，积极对敌展开斗争，并大踏步的进入敌后，结果，不仅把十七个游击区村变成根据地，且把作为敌占区的八个村子也收复了，同时并为创造新的根据地，还在敌占边沿开辟了二十四块市场。近日，北岭区由于有正规军的配合，也有很大起色。
    第三、表扬模范、树立正气，开展立功运动。在战争最紧急的情况下，他们恢复了安阳小报《人民呼声》。首先通令表扬了不怕艰险仍能带病领导民兵对敌斗争的五区王觉民区长，他们又把安阳围焚石棺炮楼出了捷报，鼓舞民兵向敌后进军，而当北岭游击集团四路进入敌后时，他们即登报表扬，而当活动中取得成绩时，不但登报表扬，且以情况给以奖励，如首先嘉奖了水冶吕炳全小组淮北关捉反动地主，侯全的小组不但在西关捉回了一特务队长母亲，还召开了小型群众会。张德义、王进校小组，觉得你敢晚上去，我敢白天去，于是二日下午在南关捉回了一个反动地主，这时县指挥部给以嘉奖。姬光礼小组更于三日上午进入西关，击伤敌哨兵一名。敌以机炮向他轰击，他说：“不怕，到南关去。”果然，他们把布告粘贴后才安然回返。……这样，既鼓舞了人心，又发扬了正气，使对敌斗争要求又达到了一步步的提高。
    第四、正面出击与敌后活动必须紧密结合。这一结合，不但可使我们找到小的、薄弱的吃它，而且可以制造更多便于我们吃的条件。很明显的，如果不是我们全面向敌出击，并且在敌人屁股后面打，石涧、石棺、子的炮楼是不会很顺利的让我们烧掉的，敌人在南岭也不会一退几十个村子，这就因为四周我们都牵制着敌人，使其不能行动自如，不能不死挨死受，或狼狈逃命。
