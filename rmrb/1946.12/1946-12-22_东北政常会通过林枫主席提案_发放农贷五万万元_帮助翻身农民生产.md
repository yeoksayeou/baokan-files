　　Northeast Government Regular Meeting Approves Chairman Lin Feng's Proposal
    Issuing 500 Million Yuan in Agricultural Loans
    Helping Liberated Peasants with Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th] The Northeast Government Committee's 11th Standing Committee meeting approved the issuance of 500 million yuan in agricultural loans to help poor peasants solve difficulties in production. This proposal was put forward by Chairman Lin Feng. Based on the results of his recent inspection of various regions, Lin noted that poor and hired peasants in various places have obtained an average of five to seven mu of land per person, and are no longer worried about food and clothing for the year. Therefore, the important task of local work is to lead and organize the broad masses to develop agricultural production. Therefore, he proposed issuing 500 million yuan in agricultural loans to help the masses purchase farm tools, plowing cattle, etc., and to lead the masses to organize themselves, implement labor exchange and mutual assistance, and enhance the concept of labor, in order to develop the agricultural economy. All the committee members unanimously approved this proposal and put forward various opinions such as developing water conservancy, encouraging cotton and flax planting, and developing animal husbandry. After this news spread, peasants in various places were overjoyed and more diligently engaged in winter production, preparing farm tools to launch a large-scale production campaign next spring.
