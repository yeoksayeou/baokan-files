　　Masses Return Land Given by Middle Peasants
　　Southern Hebei Peasants Unite More Closely
　　[Our newspaper’s Weixian 23rd dispatch] According to a Xinhua News Agency Southern Hebei branch reporter, after liberated peasants in various locations returned land to middle peasants, the unity between middle and poor peasants is unprecedented. Peasants in Mengguanzhuang, the second district of Jize, after heated discussion, realized that middle and poor peasants are one family. They returned 22 mu of "donated land" from the three middle peasant households of Meng Jiqing, Meng Jixian, and Meng Jilu, as well as one shi of grain "voluntarily" donated by middle peasant Wang Yutang, and also absorbed them into the association. Villages such as Xiaobao, Zhao Zhuang, and Yang Zhuang have also begun returning land to middle peasants. In the first district, the "voluntary" land and materials of 16 middle peasant households in Fengguanying, Song Zhuang, Hao Zhuang, Jiuchengying, Basai, and Nan Street in the city have also been fully returned. The production enthusiasm of the broad masses of middle peasants is even higher. When Zhang Erzhuang in Qinghe returned land to Feng Chengzhang, some poor peasants said: "Not only should we return his land, but we should also unite with him." Generally, middle peasants reflected, "We were really scared before, feeling like we couldn't make it past this year or next. Now that Feng Chengzhang's land has been returned, we really understand. How can we not actively produce?" In the investigation and reduction process in Liulin, they truly grasped the policy of uniting 90% of the masses, not only not struggling against middle peasants, but also winning over and educating middle peasants and backward peasants. They shared the fruits of labor like those in the association and resolved village contradictions, enabling middle peasants to actively participate in the peasant association. At the village cadre inspection meeting in the second district, they emphasized uniting with middle peasants, stating that if the interests of middle peasants are harmed, they will be resolutely returned. That night, Luxinsai held a peasant association member meeting, explaining why middle peasants should not be struggled against. After each group’s inspection, all members unanimously agreed that Tian Yuzhen was a middle peasant and should not be struggled against, and all his belongings were returned. A large number of middle peasants in the whole village joined the peasant association. In the mass movement in Zhang Si Street, Daming City, initially, middle peasant Fu Liangchen was fined five dozen hand towels. After inspection, it was deemed inappropriate, and he was given three houses in the distribution of fruits, transforming his worried expression into infinite joy.

　　群众退回中农献地
    冀南农民团结更紧
    【本报威县二十三日电】据新华社冀南分社记者报导，各地翻身农民退回中农土地后，中贫农空前团结。鸡泽二区孟贯庄农民，经过热烈讨论，认识了中贫农是一家，已退回中农孟继庆、孟继先、孟继禄三户“献地”二十二亩和中农王玉堂“自动”献粮一石，并吸收他们入会。销堡、赵庄、杨庄等村，亦开始退回中农土地。一区逢官营、宋庄、郝庄、旧城营，八塞及城内南街十六家中农的“自动”地及物资也已全部退回。广大中农的生产情绪，更为高涨。清河张二庄退回冯成章土地时，有的贫农说：“不但要退回他的土地，还要和他团结起来”。一般中农反映说：“先俺真害怕，觉着过了今年也过不了明年，现在冯成章的地都退回了，俺可真明白了，俺还能不积极生产”？柳林在查减中，真正掌握了团结百分之九十群众的政策，不仅没斗中农，而且争取教育了中农及落后农民，他们和在会的一样分到了果实，解决了村中矛盾，使中农积极参加农会。二区在全区，村干检查会上，强调提出团结中农，如损害了中农利益，坚决退回。当天夜里鲁辛塞召开农会员大会，说明为啥不该斗中农，各小组检查后，全体会员一致认为田玉振是中农，不应斗，并把东西全部退回，全村大部中农入了农会。大名市张四街群运中，起初罚了中农傅良臣五打手巾，后经检查不合适，分果实中分给他三间房子，他一改愁容为无限欢喜。
