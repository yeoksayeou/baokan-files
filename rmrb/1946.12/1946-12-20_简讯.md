    After the recovery of Juancheng, County Magistrate Liu of that county issued a letter to all fellow countrymen of the county, stating: "The atrocities of the Chiang troops, such as killing, looting, conscription, and rape, completely exposed the deceptive propaganda of the so-called central army not disturbing or harming the people. Today Juancheng has been recovered, but do not be complacent or arrogant. We should still prepare for war properly and be ready to give the Chiang troops a serious blow in order to win the early arrival of a comprehensive victory."
    Zhang Jinxiu, manager of Yuhua Factory in Xiangyuan city, was selected as a model merchant of the county this time. He focuses on developing the economy for the masses. The factory operates by pooling shares, mainly producing straw hats, supplemented by towels, soap, etc. Starting in 1942, the share capital was 40,000 yuan, and now it has grown to 5 million yuan, with the number of shares increasing sharply from 24 to 600. According to investigations, dividends were distributed five times in three years, with each yuan receiving a net dividend of more than 20 yuan. The local masses (shareholders) are happy to get big profits, and the factory partners are happy to earn more money, making it a factory where everyone gets rich.
