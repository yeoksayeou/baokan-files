　　Curb Waste!
　　Yunbei Rectifies Village Finances
　　Reasonably Revises Support Methods
　　[Our newspaper's telegram from Jilu Yu Border Region, 12th] In order to support the patriotic self-defense war for a long time, Yunbei County has specially stipulated the rectification of village finances and support methods. Since the wheat season this year, a village in Yunbei has collected 17 jin of wheat per mu and 700 yuan per mu for village funds due to the participation of militiamen in the war and the consolation of new soldiers. Some support duties were unreasonable, such as counting a trip for four or five days of stretcher bearing as one trip, and counting a month as one trip; when carts and livestock went together, they still had to provide stretcher bearers when they returned, putting households with livestock at a disadvantage. In order to curb such waste and unreasonable phenomena, the county strictly stipulates the village fund borrowing methods: 1. Village chiefs will receive a subsidy of 50 jin of grain for villages with more than 100 households, 40 jin for those with more than 60 households, and 30 jin for those with less than 50 households. 2. Militiamen receive compensation from the public when they set out, and are not allowed to spend money. 3. Self-defense team night watchmen receive six liang of rice and three jin of firewood per person per night. 4. Village office expenses are 7 jin per month for those with less than 100 households, and no more than 14 jin for those with more than 100 households. 5. No unauthorized support duties are allowed to be paid from public funds. 6. Primary school teachers are not allowed to receive more than what they should. 7. Those who embezzle village finances in various villages must return them to the masses. 8. When handling accumulated fruits, village cadres must not retain them for their own use under any pretext. 9. Any other expenses not approved by the government will be treated as embezzlement. Support Methods: 1. One trip with a cart is equivalent to one set of stretchers. Those with carts and livestock cannot be exempted from providing stretcher bearers. 2. Large carts and large cattle are used for long trips, and small cattle are used for short trips. 3. Support duties are calculated according to the number of days, with ten days counting as one full labor unit, and five days counting as half a labor unit. 4. All village cadres, except for the village chief, agricultural association chairman, and military committee director, must perform support duties. In order to cherish the people's labor and resources, the Jilu Yu Daily's short commentary calls for treating the rectification of the people's burden as a major task, conducting in-depth investigations, promptly understanding the people's suffering, the people's labor, financial and cattle burden situation, explaining the importance of their long-term struggle to educate cadres, so that cadres can be active and the people's burden can be reduced.

　　制止浪费！
    郓北整理村财政
    合理改订支差办法
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】郓北县为长期支援爱国自卫战争，特规定整理村财政与支差办法。郓北自今年麦季以来，某村因民兵参战与慰劳新战士，村粮每亩麦子出到十七斤，村款每亩出到七百元。有的支差不合理，如出担架四五天算一趟，一月也算一趟；出大车人和牲口一起去，回来时照样出担架，使有牲口户吃亏。县里为制止此种浪费和不合理现象，严格规定村款支借办法：一、村长补助粮百户以上者五十斤，六十户以上者四十斤，五十户以下三十斤。二、民兵出发公家有待遇，不准开支。三、自卫队打更，每人每夜六两米，三斤柴。四、村办公费百户以下者每月七斤，百户以上者不超过十四斤。五、偏觅支差，概不准开支公账。六、小学教员待遇除应领者外，不准多领。七、清理各村财政贪污者归还群众。八、处理积存果实，村干部不得借故留用。九、其他任何开支，不经政府批准即按贪污论。支差办法：一、出一次大车算一付担架，不能因有大车牲口不出担架。二、大车大牛出远差，小牛出近差。三、出差按天数计工，十天一整工，五天算半工。四、村干部除村长、农会长、武委会主任外，一律出差。为爱惜民力物力。冀鲁豫日报短评号召把整理群众负担当成一件大事，深入调查，及时了解群众疾苦，群众的人力财力牛力的负担情形，说明他们在长期战斗中的重要意义来教育干部，使干部积极起来，使群众负担减轻。
