[This Newspaper Taiyue 16th dispatch] The thirteen warriors of the Dongmoli militia in Jiang County broke through the fire, once again proving that the power of the people is invincible. At dawn on the 27th of last month, more than 180 enemies from Nanlou and Dajiao in Jiang County surrounded Dongmoli Village in two routes. At that time, thirteen militiamen were surrounded in a tall building. Militia Captain Wang Wenpu waved his fist and said, "We must resolutely defend ourselves and swear not to surrender!" "Right!" Thirteen voices echoed. The enemy was getting closer and closer and even set fire to the gate of the building. The militiamen climbed to the second floor to continue resisting. The enemy attempted to force the militia to surrender with fire, but they were answered with: "We have good mats, please eat this!" Then grenades mixed with rifle fire rained down. Until dusk, a militiaman who escaped when Moli Village was surrounded fired a shot in Qianshan. The thirteen warriors trapped in the building shouted in unison, "Charge! Our reinforcements have arrived, comrades, charge!" Then, one by one, they jumped out of the fire and pounced on the enemy. The enemy, thinking that our reinforcements had really arrived, retreated in panic. The thirteen warriors took advantage of the victory to pursue them for more than a mile, killing and wounding four enemy soldiers including a deputy platoon leader and squad leader. We suffered no casualties.

[This Newspaper Taiyue 16th dispatch] "Get close to the enemy and push them out" is a popular offensive slogan among the Pingyao militia guerrillas along the Tongpu Railway Line. They have also established a combat covenant called "Eight Don'ts, Seven Tasks." The Eight Don'ts are: don't run away, don't beat people (referring to civilians in the Chiang-occupied areas), don't bow to local bullies and landlords, don't be deceived by secret agents, etc. The Seven Tasks are: be resolute and brave, know how to set up minefields, learn cold-shot tactics, be able to capture secret agents in plain clothes, protect the interests of the masses, cooperate with the regular army in combat, and have the determination to drive the enemy out. As a result, the guerrilla warfare in Pingyao has become more widespread and in-depth. Flying bombing groups like Chen Dongxi, miraculous blasting teams like Pei Defu, and various scattered cold-shot heroes have emerged. Pei Defu's miraculous blasting team killed more than 30 enemies in half a month from the end of last month to the beginning of this month. His experience has two points: one is "to get close to the enemy in order to kill them." In the Qidong Bridge bombing battle, Pei Defu buried the landmine directly under the bunker, killing a total of sixteen enemies. The other is "to understand the enemy's habits and actions." Pei Defu learned the enemy's routine of going to Qidong Bridge to set up mobile sentries at dawn, so he buried a landmine on the bridge, killing five enemies in one blast. Now, the Pingyao militia are challenging Pei Defu to see who can "get close to the enemy and push them out."

　　人民力量是不可战胜的
    绛县十三勇士火里突围
    平遥民兵互勉：逼近敌人把敌人挤出去！
    裴德富逼近敌人埋雷一次炸死敌人十六名
    【本报太岳十六日电】绛县东磨里民兵十三勇士火里突围，又一次证明人民力量是不可战胜的。上月二十七日拂晓，绛县南楼、大交敌一百八十余人，分两路包围东磨里村，当时十三个民兵被包围在一座高楼上，民兵队长王文普挥动着拳头说：“我们要坚决自卫，誓死不投降！”“对”！十三个声音响成一片。敌人愈来愈逼近了，把楼房的大门也烧着了，民兵爬上二层楼，继续抵抗。敌人企图用火攻逼迫民兵缴枪，但是他们得到的回答是：“我们有很好的席子，请你们吃！”于是手榴弹夹着步枪轰轰的往下打。直到黄昏，磨里村被包围时逃出去的一个民兵，在千山上打了一枪，被围在楼上的十三个勇士，齐声高喊：“冲啊！我们的救兵到了，同志们冲呀！”便一个一个地从火里跳出来，向敌人猛扑，敌以为我们援兵真的到了，仓惶后撤，十三勇士更乘胜追击了一里多路，毙伤敌副排长、班长以下四名，我无伤亡。
    【本报太岳十六日电】“逼近敌人，把敌人挤出去”，这是同蒲线平遥民兵游击队里，近来流行着一句进攻性的口号。他们并订有斗争公约，叫作“八不要，七任务”。八不要即是不逃跑，不打人（指蒋占区老百姓），不向恶霸地主低头，不受特务欺骗等，七任务是要坚决勇敢，要会摆地雷阵，要学习冷枪战，要能捕捉特务便衣，要爱护群众利益，要配合正规军作战，要有决心把敌人赶出去。平遥游击战争，由此更加普遍更加深入地开展起来了。更涌现出陈东喜飞行爆炸组、裴德富神奇爆炸队以及各种分散的冷枪战英雄。裴德富的神奇爆炸队，自上月底至本月初，半月内炸死敌人三十余名，他的经验有两个：一是“要逼近敌人，才能把敌人炸死”。七洞桥爆炸战中，裴德富把地雷一直埋到碉堡底下，共炸死敌人十六名。一是“要摸住敌人的脾气行动”。裴德富摸住敌人天明要经七洞桥去放游动哨的规律，他就在桥上埋下地雷，一次炸死五个敌人。现在平遥民兵纷纷与裴德富挑战，看看谁能“逼近敌人，把敌人挤出去。”
