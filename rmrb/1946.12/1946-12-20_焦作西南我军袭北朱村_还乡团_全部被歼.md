　　Our Army in Jiaozuo Southwest Attacks Beizhu Village
    "Homecoming Corps" Completely Annihilated
    [Report from Changzhi by this newspaper] The battle in which the Eighth Route Army in northern Henan, combined with local militia and armed work teams, completely eliminated the Chiang Kai-shek "Homecoming Corps" entrenched in Beizhu Village, more than ten li southwest of Jiaozuo, on the evening of the 12th of last month, is still being recounted among the masses like a myth. On the evening of that day, our army, with light and swift action, advanced into Beizhu Village. When the enemy sentry discovered us, we had already reached the base of the enemy's western blockhouse. After shouting at them to surrender proved ineffective, we launched a fierce attack on the enemy. The enemy tightly closed the lower door of the blockhouse and went to the top of the building, firing at us with primitive guns. Three of our soldiers carried a large log and charged forward, smashing open the lower door of the blockhouse. More than 30 "Homecoming Corps" members were captured without resistance. Our army then besieged the eastern bunker, which was guarded by the puppet "Homecoming Corps" leader and local secret agent and bully. Under the duress of the secret agent and bully, the "Homecoming Corps" members threw all their grenades. They even pried up bricks from the top of the bunker and threw them at our army. Soldier Guo Genlai wore a large bamboo basket on his head and quickly ran to the front of the blockhouse door and set the door on fire. Our army swarmed in and threw grenades from the doorway to the second floor. The puppet "Homecoming Corps" leader trembled and shouted, "Everyone stay calm, reinforcements will be here soon." However, seeing the situation was not good, their members jumped from the top of the building and surrendered one after another. Only the leader and seven or eight die-hard secret agents were bombed to death. The battle lasted about four hours, but the enemy in Lifeng, Jiaozuo, did not dare to come to their aid. Afterwards, several "Homecoming Corps" members who had escaped went to Xinxiang to complain to the Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. The Chiang Kai-shek secret agents slammed the table and scolded, "Damn it! What did you come back for if you 'return home'? Get back there."

　　焦作西南我军袭北朱村
    “还乡团”全部被歼
    【本报长治讯】上月十二日晚，我豫北八路军结合当地民兵、武工队、将盘据焦作西南十余里北朱村之蒋记“还乡团”全部消灭之役，至今仍如神话似地在群众中传颂着。是日黄昏，我军以轻捷神速的行动，进至北朱村内。待敌哨兵发觉时，我已直抵敌西炮楼根，经喊话无效，即向敌展开猛攻，敌将炮楼下门紧关齐上楼顶，用土枪向我射击，我三个战士抬一根大木头冲上，将炮楼下门撞开，三十余“还乡团”员未及抵抗，即全部被俘，我军继即围攻伪“还乡团”长及当地特务奸霸驻守之东碉堡，“还乡团”员在特务奸霸威逼下，打尽手榴弹，竟揭起堡上之砖头向我军乱掷，战士郭根来戴了个大箩头，飞快的跑到炮楼门前，将门烧开，我军蜂涌而进，将手榴弹由楼口掷到二层楼上，伪“还乡团”长战栗地喊着：“大家沉住气，援兵马上就来。”他们的团员却见势不好，纷纷从楼顶跳下投降，只有团长和七八个死心特务被炸死。战斗持续约四小时，焦作李封之敌却未敢出援，事后，有几个漏网的“还乡团”，逃到新乡向蒋特诉苦，蒋特拍案大骂道：“妈的！叫你们‘还乡’，又来干啥？滚回去。”
