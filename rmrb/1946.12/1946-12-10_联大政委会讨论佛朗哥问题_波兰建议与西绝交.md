　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Chenggong Lake News: After referring the disarmament issue to a subcommittee, the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the Franco issue on the 3rd and 4th. The Polish representative suggested that all countries sever diplomatic and economic relations with the Franco regime, and listed facts to prove the fascist nature of the Franco regime and its threat to world peace. Representatives from Belarus, Guatemala and other countries expressed their support. Even the representatives of countries that secretly aided Franco did not dare to openly oppose the evidence listed by the Polish representative, but they played tricks on how to deal with this issue. Although American imperialism is now pursuing a policy of intervention everywhere in the world, the US representative, Connally, advocated a policy of non-interference towards Franco. The Colombian representative even suggested postponing the issue for a year. In his speech, the Soviet representative Gromyko firmly advocated that the United Nations should help the Spanish people to expel the Franco regime, and he pointed out that the policy of non-interference was a re-enactment of Munich. After two days of stormy debate, a subcommittee was established to integrate the proposals of Poland, the United States and Colombia and formulate a plan acceptable to all parties.

　　联大政委会讨论佛朗哥问题
  　波兰建议与西绝交
    【新华社延安七日电】成功湖讯：联合国大会政治安全委员会，于将裁军问题交由小组委员会处理后，即于三四两日讨论佛朗哥问题。波兰代表建议各国对佛朗哥政权断绝外交及经济关系，并列举事实证明佛朗哥政权的法西斯本质及其对世界和平的威胁。白俄罗斯、委地马拉等国代表均表支持，甚至那些暗助佛朗哥的国家的代表亦不敢公开反对波代表所列举之证据，但他们却在如何处理这一问题一点上玩弄花样。美帝国主义虽然现在全世界到处实行干涉政策，但美代表康纳利却主张对佛朗哥采取不干涉政策，哥伦比亚代表甚至建议将此问题延宕一年。苏代表葛罗米柯发言时，坚主联合国援助西班牙人民摈斥佛朗哥政权，他指出不干涉政策是慕尼黑的重演。在两天风暴雨般的辩论后，通过成立一小组委员会，综合波美哥三国建议而订出一能为各方所接受的方案。
