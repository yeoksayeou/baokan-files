Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 28th: Xinhua News Agency reporters recently interviewed General Zhou Enlai on issues related to the current situation. The following is a record of the questions and answers:

Q: What is the intention behind President Truman's statement on December 18th this year?

A: President Truman's statement is mainly to defend the reactionary China policy of the U.S. government since March this year, and there is no new content. Its intention is to use this kind of defense to deceive domestic and foreign public opinion, block criticisms from all sides, and continue to implement the reactionary China policy unchanged, so that on the one hand, the U.S. mediator can still stay in China, claiming to "be extremely willing to help China obtain peace and a truly democratic government"; on the other hand, the U.S. government can unscrupulously assist the Chiang Kai-shek government to let go of the civil war, so as to accelerate the process of China becoming a colony and appendage of U.S. imperialism. President Truman's statement obviously cannot represent American public opinion; on the contrary, it is opposed to fair American public opinion. The joint statement issued before Truman's statement by U.S. Republican Senator Flanders, Democratic Senator Morley, and four well-known American China experts is a representative of this fair public opinion of the American people.

Q: In the past year, has the U.S. government's China policy conformed to the Moscow Three-Power Communiqué and President Truman's own statement on December 15th last year?

A: Since March this year, the U.S. government's China policy has not only failed to conform to the various principles of the Moscow Three-Power Communiqué and President Truman's statement last December, but has completely violated these principles. The ceasefire agreement between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the seven resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the military reorganization plan established in China in January and February this year were in line with the above principles. General Marshall did indeed do his best to mediate and promote them at the time, so even now, after the Chiang Kai-shek government has torn up these resolutions, the Chinese Communist Party and the entire Chinese people still support the line of these resolutions. We also insist on implementing a nationwide ceasefire according to the positions of both sides' troops as of the January 13th ceasefire order. In accordance with the Political Consultative Conference line, we do not recognize the illegal and divisive "National Assembly" monopolized by the Kuomintang and any form of "constitution" passed by it.

The various principles of the Moscow Three-Power Communiqué and Truman's statement on China last December, according to Truman's own statement this time, also acknowledged stopping internal strife, expanding the government's base, allowing democratic elements to join various government departments, establishing a unified and democratic country, and ensuring consistent adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs; and guaranteed that the United States would only be "prepared to provide assistance in economic and other aspects" when "China finally progresses along the aforementioned path." But judging from the facts of the past year, the policies of both the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek sides are exactly the opposite of these principles.

U.S. Abandons January Ceasefire Position
Instead Cooperates with Chiang to Fight a Major War

Regarding the nationwide ceasefire, even in January and February, the Chiang Kai-shek government never complied with the agreement to cease fire in the Northeast. On March 27th, the Kuomintang, Communist Party, and the U.S. also specifically established a Northeast ceasefire agreement, but the Chiang Kai-shek government still violated this agreement, refusing to allow the executive groups to go to the military conflict sites to carry out ceasefire orders, instead creating a situation of major fighting in the Northeast. After June, there was even major fighting within the customs. Now, the Chiang Kai-shek government's army has invaded all the liberated areas led by the Chinese Communist Party. From January to now, it has occupied 183 cities in the liberated areas. Naturally, it has paid a considerable price. Judging from July alone, it has lost about 45 brigades (or divisions), accounting for nearly one-fifth of its total force. In this unprecedented civil war, Chiang Kai-shek has mobilized 88 percent of his total forces, about 218 brigades (or divisions), to attack the liberated areas, and the January ceasefire agreement has long been completely destroyed by him. The U.S. government and its special envoy, standing in the position of mediator, have never blamed him for this, but have instead abandoned the position of the January ceasefire agreement, refusing to restore peace according to the positions of both sides on January 13th. Isn't this clearly U.S.-Chiang cooperation to fight a major war? Where is there any intention to "stop internal strife"!

U.S. Troops Use Excuse of Repatriating Prisoners to be Stationed in China
Not Only Interfering in China's Internal Affairs
But Also Participating in China's Internal Strife

Regarding the stationing of U.S. troops in China, according to what President Truman said, their main task is to assist China in accepting surrender and repatriating prisoners, but these are actually just excuses. U.S. troops transported Chiang Kai-shek's army to North China and Central China to "accept surrender," resulting in the large-scale civil war since last winter and this summer. Their real purpose is obviously to help Chiang Kai-shek create this civil war situation. After this civil war situation was created, they pretended to "mediate" in order to achieve their selfish goals. Many troops are not needed to repatriate prisoners, nor did it make the Japanese disappear from China; what was left were exactly those Japanese war criminals who were in Yan Xishan's troops and other troops and were responsible for attacking the liberated areas. Okamura Neiji, the number one Japanese war criminal who invaded China, is not only not being tried now but is being treated favorably by the Chiang Kai-shek government. The U.S. Navy has been rampaging along the Chinese coast, and its Marines have been harassing various places in North China for more than a year. Judging from the incomplete statistics from October last year to July this year alone, the U.S. military's military actions along the Beining Railway to harass our liberated areas have been nearly 30 times, some of which were coordinated with the Chiang Kai-shek government's army. This is not only interfering in China's internal affairs, but also participating in China's internal strife.

U.S. Military Aid Worth 3.6 Billion Dollars
Makes China's Civil War Protracted

In the past year, U.S. aid to China has been carried out while the Chiang Kai-shek government persists in civil war, insists on dictatorship, and has not finally progressed towards the path of peace and democracy. In this statement, President Truman has to admit that the agreements made in January and February have not been realized, and China has not yet obtained a peaceful and truly democratic government. However, in this situation, the U.S. government has given the Chiang Kai-shek government unprecedented and massive assistance. The U.S. used its navy and air force to transport Chiang Kai-shek's army to the Northeast, North China, and Central China; not only before the January ceasefire order, but also after the ceasefire order, it violated the agreement and transported nine armies to expand the civil war. The Lend-Lease materials to China stipulated the equipment of 39 Chinese divisions during the Anti-Japanese War, but only 20 divisions were equipped before Japan's surrender. After the war, not only did the equipment not stop, it expanded to 45 divisions, and the total value of the materials reached 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. In June this year, when the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations were at their most tense, the U.S. government again proposed to the U.S. Congress to extend the Lend-Lease Act to China for ten years and send another 271 warships to Chiang Kai-shek to encourage Chiang Kai-shek's determination to break the negotiations. The agreement on the disposal of surplus materials, worth 855 million U.S. dollars, was signed when there was major fighting within China. This transaction included exactly airplanes, military vehicles, transportation equipment, and all the daily necessities in the army, because they were originally surplus materials of the army! The loans to China were as high as 750 million U.S. dollars during the war, and another 66 million U.S. dollars after the war. Therefore, the Chiang Kai-shek government currently has 300 million U.S. dollars in deposits in the United States and is negotiating with the U.S. government to purchase military supplies. If another 500 million U.S. dollars of new loans are allocated, then the Chiang Kai-shek government will be encouraged by this, and the civil war will undoubtedly continue for a long time. Therefore, judging from these most reliable and incomplete figures, the Chiang Kai-shek government has received more than 3.6 billion U.S. dollars worth of material assistance from the United States, and this assistance is directly or indirectly used for the civil war. It cannot revive China's economy, but will intensify the destruction of China's economy. And under this U.S.-made military aid, tens of thousands of victims, a year ago, had cheered for Truman's statement and Marshall's visit to China!

This Reactionary China Policy of the United States
Has Aroused Great Anger Among the Chinese People
And Impaired the Traditional Friendship Between the Chinese and American People

The purpose of the U.S. government's blatant policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war is to subdue the Chinese people and make China completely an appendage of the United States. We can prove the Chiang Kai-shek government's act of selling national sovereignty and national interests to U.S. imperialism is consistent with the U.S. imperial government's policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war from the recently signed Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, the Sino-U.S. Aviation Agreement, and the agreements on the U.S. Military Advisory Group and various military trainings. No matter how Truman defends it, saying that the U.S. government "avoids being involved in China's internal strife," it is actually the creator and instigator of China's civil war. And what he said that he is still willing to reserve assisting the Chinese people in carrying out economic revival is just to find an excuse for the U.S. government to continue to use the policy of lending to aid Chiang in the civil war. However, the U.S. government's reactionary policy cannot but arouse great anger and resolute resistance from the Chinese people, has to impair the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people, and has aroused serious attention from relevant countries internationally.

The Responsibility for the Breakdown of Negotiations Lies with Chiang's Side
The Illegal "National Assembly" Closed the Door to Kuomintang-Communist Negotiations
The Unfair U.S. Mediation Played an Encouraging Role

Q: Who is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations over the past year? Is the U.S. mediation fair?

A: The responsibility for the breakdown of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations over the past year clearly lies with the Kuomintang authorities. The January ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were the basic agreements to stop China's internal strife and realize democracy. The CCP is still willing to continue to fight for the Political Consultative Conference line and the restoration of the troop positions of both sides as of the January ceasefire order. The Kuomintang side not only destroyed these agreements, refused to restore the positions of both sides as of the January ceasefire order, and implement the various resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in order; but also continued to make in-depth attacks on the liberated areas led by the CCP, attempting to eliminate the liberated areas and their people's armed forces, and declared his party's monopolized, illegal "National Assembly" and "Constitutional Draft" that had not been agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference as legal, in order to split national unity. This action of the Chiang Kai-shek government has not only broken down the Kuomintang-Communist negotiation system, but also made negotiations impossible. Truman's statement did not mention this at all, but instead said that the CCP occupied Changchun and broke the active negotiations. In fact, the CCP army's occupation of Changchun was a self-defense action forced under the circumstances that the Chiang Kai-shek government's army destroyed the March 27th Northeast ceasefire agreement and occupied many cities in the hands of the Northeast People's Democratic Allied Army and attacked Siping Street and other places fiercely. The active negotiations, such as the June ceasefire consultation, the July Five-Person Talks, the August Stuart Mediation, the September suggestion to stop attacking Zhangjiakou, and the October mediation by the Third Party, were all destroyed by a series of new demands from the Chiang Kai-shek government. Finally, the Chiang Kai-shek government closed the door to negotiations by convening the illegal and divisive "National Assembly." The attitude of the U.S. mediator can be answered from these negotiations. The U.S.-Chiang cooperation to destroy the ceasefire agreement and the Political Consultative Conference line became more and more obvious later.

The Pseudo-Constitution Has Not Been Agreed Upon by the Political Consultative Conference
The People Will Never Recognize It
Our Party Advocates Reopening the National Assembly

Q: Now that the Chiang government's "National Assembly" has been held, is the "Constitution" produced by it valid?

A: Since the Chiang government's "National Assembly" and "Constitutional Draft" have not been unanimously agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference, have not been convened by a united government, and have no representatives from the CCP and truly democratic parties to participate in and formulate them, no matter whether this so-called "National Assembly" has been held or this so-called "Constitution" has been passed, its nature is still Chiang's National Assembly and Chiang's Constitution. We and the democratic people of the whole country will never recognize it as legal and valid.

Originally, the National Assembly agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference was a party-based National Assembly, not a universal suffrage National Assembly. Especially the so-called "National Assembly representatives" retained from ten years ago were appointed during the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang.

Now, the Chiang Kai-shek government is actually using these more than 950 so-called "National Assembly representatives" as the basis to hold its illegal and divisive one-party-run "National Assembly." No matter how the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party violate the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference to support the Chiang government, a truly new party-based National Assembly that conforms to the Political Consultative Conference line must be reopened in the face of the people's victory. Therefore, we advocated stopping the Chiang government's "National Assembly" before it was held; dissolving it during the meeting; and canceling and reopening it after it was held. The Chiang government's pseudo-constitution can only be regarded as the same as Yuan Shikai's Temple of Heaven Constitution and Cao Kun's bribery election constitution. These dictators announced in these "constitutions" what they originally did not intend to do, and the people will never recognize it.

The Prospects for Kuomintang-Communist Negotiations
Must Restore the January Troop Positions
And Cancel the Illegal National Assembly and Pseudo-Constitution
Otherwise the People Will No Longer Be Deceived

Q: So what are the prospects for Kuomintang-Communist negotiations?

A: The door to negotiations was closed by the Chiang government when it held its "National Assembly." If negotiations are to be reopened, the Chiang government must: 1. According to the ceasefire agreement, recognize and restore the troop positions of both sides on January 13th and implement a ceasefire; 2. According to the Political Consultative Conference line, cancel the illegal National Assembly and pseudo-constitution, and reopen party meetings to discuss everything. Otherwise, if the Chiang government, after the closing of its so-called "National Assembly," on the one hand, uses tricks such as reorganizing the government again, and on the other hand, continues to attack the liberated areas and actively arranges attacks on areas such as Yan'an and Harbin, then the new tricks such as the so-called "reorganization of the government" will be as deceptive as the so-called "National Assembly" that has just been held, and its main purpose is still to adapt to the requirements of the U.S. government and deceive American public opinion so that the U.S. government can use the excuse of allocating $500 million in loans and more aid to intensify the long-term civil war of slaughtering the Chinese people. We and the Chinese people will no longer be deceived by this U.S.-Chiang cooperation scheme and are determined to oppose it to the end!

　　周恩来同志谈时局
    杜鲁门声明是掩饰对华反动政策
    欲加速中国沦为美国殖民地过程
    一年来完全违背莫斯科三国决议
    【新华社延安二十八日电】新华社记者顷就目前时局有关问题访问周恩来将军，兹记其问答如下：
    问：美国杜鲁门总统今年十二月十八日的声明，用意何在？
    答：杜鲁门总统的声明，主要地是为今年三月以来美国政府的反动的对华政策作辩护，并无新的内容。其用意则想以此种辩护来蒙蔽国内外舆论，堵塞各方面责难，而得以继续不变的执行反动的对华政策，以便一方面美国调人仍可留驻中国，扬言所谓“极愿帮助中国，使其获得和平及真正民主的政府”；另方面，美国政府却又可肆无忌惮地援助蒋介石政府，使其放手进行内战，好加速中国成为美帝国主义殖民地与附庸的过程。杜鲁门总统的这个声明，显然不能代表美国的民意；相反的，它是与美国公正舆论对立的。在杜鲁门声明以前发表的美国共和党参议员佛兰德斯、民主党参议员莫莱和美国四位著名中国专家的联合声明，便是这种美国人民公正舆论的代表。
    问：一年来，美国政府的对华政策是否符合莫斯科三国公告及杜鲁门总统自己在去年十二月十五日的声明？
    答：从今年三月以来，美国政府的对华政策不仅不符合去年十二月莫斯科三国公告与杜鲁门总统声明的各项原则，并且完全违背了这些原则。今年一二月间，在中国成立的国共停战协定、政协七项决议与整军方案，是符合于上述原则的。而马歇尔将军在当时确实尽了调解与推动之力，所以直到现在即在蒋介石政府撕毁了这些决议以后，中国共产党及全中国人民仍然拥护这些决议的路线。我们并坚持依照一月十三日停战令的双方军队位置，实行全国停战。依照政协路线，不承认国民党一手包办的非法的分裂的“国大”及其所通过的任何形式的“宪法”。
    去年十二月的莫斯科三国公告与杜鲁门声明的对华各项原则，就照这次杜鲁门自己的声明，也承认为停止内争，扩大政府基础，使民主分子加入政府各部门，成立统一民主国家，保证一致遵守不干涉中国内政之政策；并保证仅仅在“中国最后向上述之途径进展时”，美国才“准备在经济及其他各方面予以协助”。但就一年来经过的事实看，美蒋两方的政策，恰恰与这些原则相反。
    美放弃一月停战立场
    反与蒋合作放手大打
    关于全国停战，就在一二月间，蒋介石政府也从未遵照协议在东北停战。三月二十七日，国共美三方又专门成立了东北停战协定，蒋介石政府仍然违背这个协定，不准执行小组前往军事冲突地点执行停战命令，反而造成东北大打的局面。六月以后，更在关内大打。打到现在，蒋介石政府军队已经侵入了所有中共领导的解放区。从一月到现在，已经侵占了解放区的一百八十三个城市。自然，它所付出的代价相当大，单从七月算起，它已经损失了四十五个旅（或师）左右，几占其全兵力的五分之一。这样规模空前的内战，蒋介石已动员其总兵力的百分之八十八，约二百一十八个旅（或师）来进攻各解放区，一月停战协定早被他破坏净尽。美国政府及其特使站在调人地位，对此从无片言相责，反而也放弃一月停战协定的立场，拒绝依照一月十三日停战令双方的位置恢复和平，这不明显地是美蒋合作放手大打么？那有丝毫“停止内争”之意！
    美军借口遣俘驻华
    不仅干涉中国内政
    且已参加中国内争
    关于美军驻华，照杜鲁门总统所云，其主要任务是协助中国受降与遣俘，其实这都是借口。美军运送蒋介石军队至华北、华中“受降”，结果乃造成去冬及今夏以来的大规模内战，其真实目的，显然就是帮助蒋介石造成这种内战局面。在这种内战局面造成以后，自己又来装模作样的“调解”，以便达到其自私目的。遣俘用不着许多军队，亦未使日人在中国绝迹，留下的正好是那种在阎锡山等部队中担任进攻解放区的日本战犯。日本侵华第一号战犯冈村宁次，现在不但未审判，且受蒋介石政府优待。美海军在中国沿海横行，其陆战队在华北各地侵扰，均已一年多了。单就去年十月到今年七月的不完全统计，美军沿北宁路向我解放区侵扰的军事行动，便将近有三十次之多，其中有配合蒋介石政府军队一道行动的，这不仅是干涉中国内政，而且已参加中国内争了。
    援蒋军火价值卅六亿
    使中国内战绵延不已
    一年来美国对华援助，是在蒋介石政府坚持内战、坚持独裁、并未最后向和平与民主之途径进展时进行的。杜鲁门总统在这次声明中，也不得不承认一二月所作的协议并未实现，而中国也还未获得和平及真正民主的政府。可是美国政府就在这种情况下，给予蒋介石政府以空前的大量的援助，美国以海空军运送蒋介石政府军队至东北、华北、华中；不仅在一月停战令前，即在停战令后，也还违反协定，运送了九个军去扩大内战。对华租借物资在抗战中规定装备中国三十九个师，但在日本投降前仅装备了二十个师，战后不但没有停止装备，竟反扩张为四十五个师，物资总值已达十五万万美元。而在今年六月国共谈判最紧张时，美国政府又向美国会提议延长对华租借法案十年，并另送军舰二百七十一艘给蒋，以助长蒋介石敢于使谈判破裂的决心。剩余物资的处理协定，值价八亿五千五百万美金，是在中国关内大打时签字的。此项交易恰恰包括飞机、军用汽车、交通器材及一切军队中的日常必需品，因为它们本来就是军队的剩余物资啊！对华贷款在战时已有七亿五千万美元之巨，战后又有六千六百万美元，因此现时蒋介石政府在美存款尚有三亿美元，正在与美政府接洽购买军火。若再划出新借款五亿美元，则蒋介石政府受此鼓励，内战定将长期继续无疑。故单就这些最可靠而并不完全的数字看来，蒋介石政府得到美国的物资援助，值价已超过三十六亿美元，而这些援助都是直接或间接地用之于内战，决不能使中国经济复兴，反而加剧中国经济的破坏。并且在这种美造军火下，成千成万的牺牲者，在一年前都曾为杜鲁门声明和马歇尔来华而欢欣鼓舞过的啊！
    美国这种对华反动政策
    激起中国人民极大愤怒
    妨害了中美两国人民传统的友谊
    美国政府这种露骨的援蒋内战政策，其目的在想压服中国人民，使中国完全变成美国附庸。我们从最近签订的中美友好通商航海条约、中美航空协定及美国军事顾问团与各种军事训练的协定看来，即可证明蒋介石政府出卖国家主权和民族利益给美帝国主义的行为，是与美帝国政府援蒋内战政策相适应的。不管杜鲁门如何强辩，说美国政府“避免牵入中国内争”，实际它已是中国内战的制造者与鼓舞者。而他所说的仍愿保留协助中国人民实行经济复兴的话，不过是为美国政府继续以借贷援蒋内战的政策寻找借口而已。可是，美政府这种反动政策，不能不引起中国人民的极大愤怒与坚决反抗，不得不妨害了中美两国人民传统的友谊，并引起国际上有关国家严重的注意。
    谈判破裂责在蒋方
    非法“国大”关闭国共谈判之门
    美国调处不公平起了鼓励作用
    问：一年来国共谈判破裂的责任，究竟属谁？美国调处是否公正？
    答：一年来国共谈判破裂的责任，显然属于国民党当局。一月停战协定与政协决议为停止中国内争、实现民主之基本协定，中共方面至今仍愿为政协路线与恢复一月停战令的双方驻军位置而继续奋斗。国民党方面则不仅破坏了这些协议，拒绝恢复一月停战令的双方位置，与依序实施政协各项决议；并且继续向中共所领导的各解放区做深入的进攻，企图消灭解放区及其人民武装，宣布他一党包办未经政协协议的非法的“国大”与“宪草”为合法，以分裂民族团结。蒋介石政府这种行动，不但已使国共谈制破裂，并且更使谈判成为不可能。杜鲁门的声明，竟对此只字不提，反而说中共攻占长春，并破裂了积极性的谈判。事实上，中共军队攻占长春，是在蒋介石政府军队破坏三月二十七日东北停战协定占领东北人民民主联军手中许多城市，并猛攻四平街等情况之下被迫采取的自卫行动。而积极性的谈判如六月停战协商，七月五人会谈，八月司徒调解，九月停攻张家口的建议，十月第三方面的调解，都被蒋介石政府一连串的新要求所破坏了。最后，蒋介石政府更以召开非法的分裂的“国大”，关闭了谈判之门，美国调人的态度，可从这些谈判中得到回答。美蒋合作以破坏停战协定与政协路线，也愈到后来愈明显了。
    伪宪未经政协同意
    人民决不承认
    我党主张重开国大
    问：蒋政府的“国大”既已开过，其所产生的“宪法”是否有效？
    答：蒋政府的“国大”与“宪草”，既未经政协一致同意，又无联合政府召集，更无中共及真正民主党派的代表参加和制定，故不论这所谓“国大”已经开过，这所谓“宪法”已经通过，其性质依然是蒋记国大、蒋记宪法，我们及全国民主人士决不会承认它为合法为有效。
    本来，政协协议的国大是党派的国大，并非普选的国大，尤其是被保留的十年前的所谓“国大代表”，更是国民党一党专政时所指派。
    现在，蒋介石政府竟以这九百五十多名的所谓“国大代表”做基础，开他的非法的分裂的一党包办的“国大”，不管青年党、民社党如何违背政协决议去为蒋政府捧场，真正合乎政协路线的党派性的新的国大，在人民胜利面前总要从新开过的。所以我们对蒋政府召开的“国大”，在未开会前主张停开；开会期中，主张解散；既开会后，主张取消重开。蒋政府的伪宪，也只有把他当作袁世凯天坛宪法和曹锟贿选宪法一样看待。这些独裁者在这些“宪法”中，宣布了他们所原来不打算做的东西，而人民也决不会承认他的。
    国共谈判前途
    必须恢复一月驻军位置
    并取消非法国大及伪宪
    否则人民再不受骗
    问：然则国共谈判前途如何？
    答：谈判之门是蒋政府拿它召开“国大”的手关闭的，如要重开谈判，蒋政府必须：一、根据停战协定，承认恢复一月十三日双方驻军位置，实行停战；二、根据政协路线，取消非法国大及伪宪，重开党派会议协商一切。否则，蒋政府如果在其所召开的“国大”闭幕后，一方面再来什么改组政府等把戏，另方面仍继续向解放区进攻，并积极布置进攻延安与哈尔滨等地区，则所谓“改组政府”等的新把戏、它的欺骗性也同刚开过的所谓“国大”一样，而它的主要目的还在适应美国政府的要求，哄骗美国舆论，以便美国政府得在拨付五亿美元借款与更多援助的借口来加紧进行屠杀中国人民的长期内战。我们与中国人民对于这种美蒋合作的意图，决不再受欺骗，决心反对到底！
