　　Taiyue Cultural Circles Initiate Writing-About-Soldiers Movement
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 13th] Various cultural institutions and organizations in this district have launched a "One Book for the Army Movement" and a "Writing-About-Soldiers Movement." The Taiyue Administrative Office's Department of Culture and Education, the Preparatory Committee of the Cultural Circles Federation, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily, the Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore, and other cultural institutions and organizations held a meeting on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss and decide on the following: (1) Solicit donations of books, or donations to be used by the Xinhua Bookstore to purchase books. The books should preferably be new and accessible. (2) The collection point for book donations is the Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore, and the list of donors will be published regularly in the Xinhua Daily. (3) The deadline is before the Lunar New Year. On the 4th, the Preparatory Committee of the Cultural Circles Federation issued a call to all cultural workers in the district to write about soldiers. The call stated: "In the thorough defeat of the joint offensive of the Sino-American reactionaries, the military front mainly uses guns to eliminate the enemy, while our cultural front should also closely integrate with the military front and take up the pen to complete the task of eliminating the enemy ideologically. This requires concentrating our efforts on writing about soldiers, writing about our heroic examples against the civil war, to enhance our morale and diminish the enemy's spirit." The call concluded by particularly emphasizing: "Take immediate action, personally, to write more popular novels, stories, clappers, songs, dances, xiangsheng, etc., to launch a writing-about-soldiers movement."

    【本报太岳十三日电】本区各文化机关团体，发起“一本书劳军运动”及“写兵运动”。太岳行署文教处、文化界联合会筹委会、太岳新华日报、太岳新华书店等文化机关团体，于八日下午集会讨论决定：（一）募捐书，或捐款由新华书店购成书，书籍最好是新而通俗的。（二）收集书款处为太岳新华书店，募捐名单将定期在新华日报公布。（三）截止日期到旧历年前。四日文化界联合会筹委会向全区文化工作者发出写兵号召，该号召称：在彻底打败中美反动派的联合进攻中，在军事战线上主要是以枪杆子消灭敌人，而我文化战线上亦应紧密结合军事战线，拿起笔杆来完成从思想上消灭敌人的任务。这就要集中力量大力写兵，写我们反内战的英勇范例，以长我之志，灭敌人之风。该号召最后特别强调：立即行动起来，亲自动手，多编写些通俗的小说、故事、快板、歌曲、舞蹈、相声等开展一个写兵运动。
