Xinhua News Agency, Northern Jiangsu, Urgent Telegram, 17th Night: The New Fourth Army on the Northern Jiangsu front has achieved an unprecedented and enormous victory. According to preliminary statistics, over 20,000 Chiang troops have been annihilated between the Grand Canal and the Mu River. The frontline headquarters of the New Fourth Army Field Army has just issued a communique stating that from December 12th to 22:00 on December 17th, in six days and nights, our army completely annihilated the entire three brigades of the invading Chiang troops in the northeast of Suqian: the Pre-3rd Brigade of the 57th Division, the 41st Brigade of the 26th Division, and the 60th Brigade of the 69th Division, a part of the 11th Division headquarters, nearly two regiments of the 11th Brigade and 118th Brigade of the same division, a part of the 18th Brigade of the same division, and the 15th Engineer Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's Army Headquarters, totaling about four brigades. The remaining two-plus regiments of the 11th Brigade and 118th Brigade of the 11th Division, as well as the newly arrived 18th Brigade of the same division and the 92nd Brigade of the 69th Division (only one regiment, rebuilt by forcibly conscripting laborers after the entire brigade was annihilated in the Yugou-Chaoyang area of Huaibei), have also been surrounded by our army. Ten thousand Chiang army prisoners have already been sent to the rear.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Chiang troops on the southern Jiangsu-Anhui front have already lost 7,000 men in the battle to invade Yancheng, and the Chiang army's offensive has been thwarted. Since December 12th, the remnants of the Chiang army's 83rd Division and 65th Division have launched three offensives against Ye Ting City (Yancheng). The New Fourth Army fought bravely in self-defense, annihilating over a thousand Chiang troops in the area north of Dongtai, including Baiju and Wu@. After achieving the objective of annihilating the enemy's active forces, the New Fourth Army took the initiative to withdraw from Wu@ on the evening of the 16th. It is reported that Chiang troops on this line began to gather around 12 regiments from the 83rd Division, 65th Division, 67th Division, and 25th Division on November 26th, launching a three-pronged invasion of Yancheng from Dongtai, Xinghua, and Linze. They once invaded the Wu@ and Qinnan Cang (50 li southwest of Yancheng) line. At that time, with the cooperation of the broad masses, the New Fourth Army successively killed or captured over 6,000 Chiang troops in the Dingxi to Wu@ area, sank more than ten armored speedboats, and shot down one U.S.-made Chiang aircraft. By the 9th of this month, the Chiang troops on the front had retreated to the Baiju area, while the western route had shrunk back to the Xinghua to Linze line.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th: Xin'an Town, on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, one of the major offensive targets of the Chiang troops in Northern Jiangsu, is still where the people are living firmly despite constant harassment from Chiang aircraft. (Attached picture)
