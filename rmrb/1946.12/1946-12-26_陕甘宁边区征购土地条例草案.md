Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Land Requisition and Purchase Regulations (Draft)

Chapter I General Principles

Article 1: These regulations are formulated in accordance with the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Third Government Committee of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. In areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, land bonds will be issued to requisition and purchase land from landlords exceeding the amount they should retain, and distribute it to landless or land-poor peasants, in order to achieve the goal of "land to the tiller."

Chapter II Scope of Requisition and Purchase

Article 2: All land owned by landlords exceeding the following retention amounts may be requisitioned and purchased.

	1. The average amount of land retained for each member of a general landlord's family should be more than 50% of the average amount of land owned by each local middle peasant. (For example, if a middle peasant has six mu per person, a landlord should have nine mu per person.)
	2. Landlords who have made significant contributions in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Self-Defense War should retain an average amount of land per family member that is twice the average amount of land owned by each local middle peasant. (For example, if a middle peasant has six mu per person, a landlord should have twelve mu per person.)
	3. Land cultivated by the landlord himself shall not be requisitioned and purchased.

Article 3: If a landlord's family is outside the Border Region, land should be retained according to the provisions of Article 2. Before the landlord returns to reside in the Border Region, the local government shall manage the retained land on behalf of the landlord. After the landlord returns, the land shall be returned to him for self-management.

Article 4: If the land retained by a landlord after dedicating land exceeds the amount that should be retained according to Article 2, the excess portion shall still be requisitioned and purchased. If it is less than the amount that should be retained, the county government shall submit a request to the Border Region government for appropriate supplementary issuance of land bonds.

Article 5: Land owned by rich peasants shall not be requisitioned and purchased.

Land rented out by non-landlord elements due to lack of labor shall also not be requisitioned and purchased.

Chapter III Assessment of Land Prices

Article 6: Land prices shall be specifically assessed by the local township government in conjunction with the township peasants' association and the landlord. The assessment standard should be based on the different land prices and land quality in various places, with the highest not exceeding the sum of two years' harvest of the land in a normal year, and the lowest not lower than one year's harvest of the land in a normal year.

The land price assessment standards for areas with sparse population and vast land, or newly reclaimed land, are not subject to the restrictions of the preceding paragraph.

Article 7: Land prices shall be calculated in terms of refined grain and "gongdou".

Article 8: The land price for requisitioned and purchased land shall be calculated using a progressive reduction method. For landlords whose average land price per person is below five shi, the full price shall be given; for those exceeding five shi but not exceeding ten shi, 80% of the amount exceeding five shi shall be given; for those exceeding ten shi but not exceeding fifteen shi, 60% of the amount exceeding ten shi shall be given; for those exceeding fifteen shi but not exceeding twenty shi, 40% of the amount exceeding fifteen shi shall be given; for those exceeding twenty shi but not exceeding twenty-five shi, 20% of the amount exceeding twenty shi shall be given; for those exceeding twenty-five shi but not exceeding thirty shi, 10% of the amount exceeding twenty-five shi shall be given; for those exceeding thirty shi, no price shall be given for the excess portion.

(Explanation): According to the above regulations, for example, if the average land price per person for Landlord A is five shi and five dou, according to the progressive reduction method stipulated in these regulations, no reduction shall be made for the amount below five shi, and 80% of the five dou exceeding five shi shall be given, which is four dou. Therefore, the actual land price obtained is five shi and four dou. If the average land price per person for Landlord B is twenty-four shi, the progressive reduction calculation method should be five shi (the first five shi is given at full price) plus four shi (because 80% should be given for the amount exceeding five shi up to ten shi, which is four shi), plus three shi (because 60% should be given for the amount exceeding ten shi up to fifteen shi, which is three shi), plus two shi (because 40% should be given for the amount exceeding fifteen shi up to twenty shi, which is two shi), plus eight dou (because 20% should be given for the amount exceeding twenty shi up to twenty-five shi, which is eight dou). The total actual land price obtained is fourteen shi and six dou.

Article 9: The amount of land owned by each landlord household shall be calculated based on the total amount of land they own within the Border Region.

Chapter IV Purchase of Land

Article 10: The land requisitioned and purchased by the government shall be distributed to landless or land-poor peasants at half of the original requisition and purchase price. The purchase price shall be paid off in ten years. Those who are poor and unable to pay may be exempted from payment after the county government submits a request to the Border Region government for approval.

Article 11: The purchase of land should be based on current cultivation, and reasonable adjustments should be made to ensure that the quantity and quality of land owned by each person reach a general average.

Article 12: The following personnel have priority in purchasing land:

	1. Poor tenant farmers and farm laborers who cultivate the land themselves.
	2. Surviving family members of revolutionary martyrs, direct family members of active-duty soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers from impoverished families.

The amount of land purchased by each member of the above personnel, including his/her own land, shall not exceed the average amount of land owned by each local middle peasant.

Article 13: Migrant refugees shall have the same rights to purchase land as local residents.

Workers, small handicraftsmen, small merchants, etc., shall have the quantity of land they purchase stipulated by the township government and the peasants' association, taking into account the local land conditions and family living needs.

After vagrants and idlers purchase land, the local government shall educate them to work diligently and produce, and shall not allow them to abandon the land.

Article 14: The purchase of land shall be carried out on a township basis. When possible and necessary, the county government may make adjustments in neighboring townships.

Chapter V Repayment of Land Bonds

Article 15: The Border Region Government entrusts the Border Region Bank as the management agency for the repayment of land bonds.

Article 16: The land bond fund shall be the Border Region agricultural tax and the payment from purchasers.

Article 17: The face value of land bonds shall be calculated in terms of refined grain.

Article 18: Land bonds shall be repaid in ten years, with an annual interest rate of five per thousand. The repayment period is at the end of autumn each year.

Article 19: The principal and interest of land bonds due each year can be used to offset agricultural taxes, but only land bonds within the county can be transferred for offsetting and cannot be circulated on the market.

Article 20: The regulations on land bonds shall be formulated separately.

Chapter VI Other

Article 21: Land mortgaged by landlords to peasants shall be subject to the example of requisition and purchase; if the original mortgage price is higher than the requisition and purchase price, the landlord shall not return the overcharged mortgage price. If the original mortgage price is lower than the requisition and purchase price, the shortfall shall be compensated with land bonds.

Article 22: The landlord's surplus houses and cave dwellings (including mills) and foundations and cliffs outside his/her own courtyard can all be requisitioned and purchased with land bonds. And at half of the original requisition and purchase price, it is distributed to people who have no or little housing. The purchase value of the purchase shall not exceed two-thirds of the local current price.

If the houses and cave dwellings inhabited by tenant farmers are built by the tenant farmers themselves, they shall belong to the tenant farmers and no further price shall be given.

Article 23: The requisition and purchase of land occupied by religious groups and temples shall be decided by the public opinion of the local people. The requisition and purchase of clan land (or called community land, ancestral hall land, or cemetery association land) shall be decided by the township government and the peasants' association in consultation with the public opinion of the clan members.

Article 24: If the land rights of the landlord's barren mountains or "pulled wasteland" are not clearly documented, in addition to leaving the landlord enough land for cultivation, the rest shall be taken into public ownership. If there is indeed documentary evidence, in addition to leaving the landlord land in accordance with Article 2, if the average land per person is within 100 mu, the county government shall issue land bonds for requisition and purchase according to the land quality and the landlord's actual living needs. The portion exceeding 100 mu shall be taken into public ownership without compensation.

Article 25: Trees and vegetable gardens on the land shall belong to the tenant farmer if planted by the tenant farmer; if planted by the landlord, they shall belong to the landlord. Naturally growing forests on barren mountains shall be dealt with according to the land.

Chapter VII Supplementary Provisions

Article 26: Landlords who conceal land or engage in fraudulent practices such as false mortgages and sales shall have the concealed and fraudulent portions confiscated.

Article 27: These Regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.

Article 28: The power to interpret these Regulations belongs to the Border Region Government.
