　　"I'm not selling my saltpeter anymore!"
　　A story of Yuan Dynasty peasants supporting the army
　　Liu Zhan'ao, an old man in his fifties from Shuguan South Street in the Yuan Dynasty, used to make a living by leaching saltpeter. After the rent reduction movement, he rose to become a middle peasant. He has two sons. The eldest son is the village head and is supported by the entire village for leading the poor to turn over. Now, the father and sons still boil salt, but his salt boiling and saltpeter extraction techniques are particularly good. Surrounding villages all praise him, and his saltpeter is sold very widely.
　　Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops attacked the Jiluyu Liberated Area, he told his two sons and nephews, "Let's do it. If Old Chiang comes, we'll have to wait to die if we don't. We can't die in their hands for nothing." Then he said, "Chairman Mao has been good to us, giving poor people food to eat and clothes to wear, and completely turning them over. We have to be worthy of Chairman Mao even as we die." One day, a cigarette roller asked, "Are you selling your saltpeter?" He replied, "Selling it to you to roll cigarettes? I'm using it to send to the Eighth Route Army to make hand grenades and beat the grandsons of Old Chiang!" Now he has handed over all the saltpeter to the cooperative, which has been transferred to the iron factory. (Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Branch)

　　“我的硝不卖了！”
    元朝农民拥军故事
    元朝束馆南街刘占鳌是个五十多岁的老头，过往以淋淋为生，查减运动后，上升为中农，他有两个儿子，长子任本村村长，因领导贫苦群众翻了身，为全村拥护。现父子俩依然熬盐，但他熬盐与拉硝的技术特别高，周围村都称道他，他的硝出售的特别广。
    自蒋军进攻冀鲁豫解放区，他就给他两个儿子和侄子们说：“干吧，老蒋过来了不干就得等死，咱不能白白死在他们手里。”接着说：“毛主席对得起咱，叫穷人有饭吃有衣穿，彻底翻了身，临死也得对起毛主席。”一天，有个搓烟卷的问道：“你的硝卖不？”他答道：“卖给你们搓烟干吧？用他送给八路军造手榴弹打老蒋龟孙咧。”现在他已经把所有的硝都交合作社，转送铁工厂去了。              （新华社冀南分社）
