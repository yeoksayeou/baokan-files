　　Our Army in Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui Launches Counter-attack
    500 Enemies Annihilated on the Qi-Tai Highway
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] On the 8th of this month, Chiang's army's 190th Regiment of the 15th Reorganized Division and the 2nd Regiment of the Henan Security Corps, advanced along the Qi (County) - Tai (Kang) highway from Liuzhai and Longqu towards the Eighth Route Army of our Henan-Jiangsu-Anhui Military Region. They were met with a counter-attack from our army in the area. After 18 hours of fierce fighting, the invading army was completely routed by us. More than 200 enemies were killed or wounded, and more than 300 were captured. Two heavy machine guns, six light machine guns, and 150 rifles were seized. The Chiang-puppet security corps stationed at Longqu, upon hearing the news, fled to Songdian, where they were ambushed by our forces. One light machine gun, 28 long and short guns, and thousands of rounds of ammunition were seized. The Chiang army scurried back to Qixian city in a sorry state. (Attached picture)
