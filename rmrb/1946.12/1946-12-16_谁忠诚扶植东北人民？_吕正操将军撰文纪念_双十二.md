Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 13th: General Lü Zhengcao, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, recently wrote an article entitled "Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Double Twelve Incident." The article stated: "Ten years ago today, a world-shaking upheaval erupted in Chinese history. This was the righteous act of General Zhang Xueliang, the leader of the Northeast Army, and General Yang Hucheng, the leader of the Northwest Army, in Xi'an, jointly opposing Chiang Kai-shek. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek insisted on the policy of 'pacifying the internal situation before resisting foreign aggression,' which plunged the fate of the entire Chinese nation into a serious crisis. The nationwide movement against civil war, dictatorship, and national betrayal was rising day by day, and the Xi'an Incident was a result of this movement. The eight proposals for resisting Japanese aggression and saving the nation put forward by Zhang Xueliang at that time all reflected the will of the people of the whole country. But why did the incident break out alone in the Northeast Army? Obviously, Chiang Kai-shek implemented internal warfare and dictatorship, excluded dissidents, and did not hesitate to sacrifice non-direct troops. His continuous betrayal of the country not only brought disaster to the entire nation, but also brought the pain of family destruction and displacement to the vast number of people in the occupied areas. Since the 'September 18th' Incident, the Northeast Army was initially ordered not to resist, handing over the great land to Japanese imperialism, and then transferred to the 'Communist Suppression' civil war, playing the tragedy of Chinese killing each other. In the past five years, they have fought in several provinces, and their elite have been almost completely lost. Especially after arriving in the Northwest, the complete annihilation of the 110th Division and the 102nd Division. Chiang Kai-shek never gave them any replenishment for this serious loss, which shows that the Xi'an Incident broke out in the Northeast Army, which was by no means accidental." The article continued: "After the outbreak of the Xi'an Incident, the Chinese Communist Party, in order to take care of the overall situation, tried its best to mediate and firmly advocated a peaceful settlement. Chiang Kai-shek was finally forced to accept General Zhang Xueliang's eight proposals, thus reversing the situation, stopping the civil war, and realizing peace. However, Chiang Kai-shek's obsession with dictatorship and the exclusion of dissidents remained unchanged. After Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing, he immediately tore up his promise and detained General Zhang Xueliang, and from then on, he did everything possible to divide the Northeast Army; the assassination of General Wang Yizhe of the Northeast Army was a major conspiracy by Chiang Kai-shek to disintegrate the Northeast Army. After the July 7th Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek took the opportunity to divide and transfer the Northeast Army to the front lines, fighting alone. The 67th, 49th, 51st, 53rd, and Cavalry 2nd Armies suffered excessive sacrifices without replenishment and were no longer considered armies, but they were also subjected to Chiang Kai-shek's 'disbandment.' This is the most tragic end of the Northeast Army's heroic resistance." The article concluded: "The only one who truly faithfully supported the anti-Japanese forces of the people of Northeast China was the Communist Party. The people of Northeast China established the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. In Hebei, they supported the 53rd Army; the 53rd Army, which remained in central Hebei, had only a thousand people, but later developed into tens of thousands, adhering to the guerrilla warfare in the central Hebei Plain and opening up an advance base for advancing into Northeast China. In Shandong, they supported the 51st Army; a part of the 51st Army remained in the Binhai area and later developed into a strong force. In Chahar Province, they supported Zhang Xueshi, creating a strong force. This is the basic force that later advanced into Guanwai to cooperate with the Soviet Red Army to drive out the Japanese invaders and recover the lost territory, and it is also the basic force that constitutes today's Northeast Democratic Allied Army. Therefore, I cannot but express my sincere gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party on behalf of the 40 million people of Northeast China. I would like to express my heartfelt respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. On the other hand, I cannot but deeply mourn the soldiers of the Northeast Army who were driven to the front lines by Chiang Kai-shek to fight alone and sacrifice in the War of Resistance against Japan on behalf of the 40 million people of Northeast China. I extend my deep condolences to the officers and soldiers of the Northeast Army who were disbanded and unemployed, and to the families of the martyrs, orphans, and widows of the Northeast Army who fought in the War of Resistance against Japan. Finally, on behalf of the 40 million people of Northeast China, I would like to issue a warning to Chiang Kai-shek: The people of Northeast China have endured 14 years of suffering and driven out Japanese imperialism, and they will never allow American imperialism to come again. The Emperor Puyi has been overthrown, and we will never allow another Emperor Chiang Kai-shek to come again. We will resolutely fight to the end against civil war, dictatorship, and national betrayal."

　　谁忠诚扶植东北人民？
    吕正操将军撰文纪念“双十二”
    【新华社延安十三日电】东北民主联军副总司令吕正操将军为纪念双十二顷撰写“双十二事变十周年纪念”一文该文称：“十年前的今天，中国历史上爆发了震惊世界的巨变。这就是东北军领袖张学良将军在西安与西北军领导者杨虎城将军共同反对蒋介石，举行了义举。当时蒋介石坚持“先安内而后攘外”的政策，使得整个中华民族命运已陷入严重危机，全国人民反内战反独裁反卖国的运动，日益高涨，西安事变正是这一运动结果。当时张学良所提出的八项抗日救国主张，都是反映着全国人民意志。但是事变为什么会单独爆发于东北军中呢？很显然的，蒋介石实行内战独裁，排除异己，不惜以非嫡系部队为牺牲品。而其不断卖国的结果，不仅给全民族带来了灾难，而且给沦陷区广大人民带来家破人亡流离失所之痛苦。东北军自“九一八”之后，始而奉命不准抵抗，拱手将大好河山让与日本帝国主义，继而被调到“剿共”内战中去，演着中国人自相残杀的惨剧。五年之中，转战数省，精锐损失殆尽。特别是到达西北后，一一○师及一○二师的全军覆没。而蒋介石对此严重损失，从不给他们任何补充，由此可见，西安事变之所以爆发于东北军中，绝不是偶然的”。该文继称：“西安事变爆发后，中国共产党为了照顾大局，极力从中调解，坚主和平解决，蒋介石终于被迫接受张学良将军八项主张，这样才扭转了时局，停止内战，实现和平。然而蒋介石醉心独裁、排除异己政策丝毫未变。蒋介石回南京后，马上撕毁诺言，扣押张学良将军，从此对东北军则极尽分化之能事；东北军王以哲将军被刺身死，乃是蒋介石瓦解东北军的极大阴谋。七七抗战之后，蒋介石更乘机分调东北军至最前线，孤军作战，六七、四九、五一、五三及骑二军各军，就这样遭受了过重牺牲又无补充而不成其为罢了，但又遭到蒋介石的“编遣”，这就是东北军英勇抗战最悲惨之下场”。该文最后称：“真正忠诚扶植东北人民抗日力量的还只有一个共产党。东北人民成立了抗日联军。在河北则扶植了五十三军；五十三军留在冀中的，不过千人，后来发展成为数万之众，坚持冀中平原游击战，开辟了挺进东北的前进阵地。在山东则扶植了五十一军；五十一军留在滨海一部，后来发展成为一支劲旅。在察省则扶植了张学诗，创造一支劲旅。这就是以后挺进关外配合苏联红军驱逐日寇收复失地的基本力量，亦就是构成今天东北民主联军基本力量。因此我不能不代表东北四千万人民向中国共产党致诚挚的谢忱。向毛主席和朱总司令致以衷心敬意。另一方面则不能不代表东北四千万人民，向抗日战争中被蒋介石驱至前线孤军奋战牺牲士兵深致哀悼。向东北军被编遣失业流亡官、兵及东北军抗战烈士遗族、孤儿、寡妇致深切慰问。最后我代表东北四千万人民向蒋介石发出警告：东北人民经受了十四年痛苦，驱逐了日本帝国主义，绝不允许再来个美帝国主义。打倒了溥仪皇上，绝不允许再来个蒋介石皇上。我们将坚决为反对内战独裁卖国奋斗到底。
