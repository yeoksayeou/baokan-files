[Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 14th] Recently, Donghuwang Village in Qingfeng County, after inspecting war support work, specifically stipulated reasonable work point calculation methods for stretcher bearers and the conversion methods between carts and stretcher bearers: 1. Work point calculation method for stretcher bearers: Eighty-one militiamen from eight villages were selected, and sixty of the stronger ones were chosen to form four stretcher bearer teams, each with fifteen people, including one team leader. When the district dispatches stretchers, the militia captain will assign them to each team. If one stretcher is needed, each team sends two people; if two stretchers are needed, each team sends four people. The order of rotation is the responsibility of each team leader, determining who departs, and requiring permission from the village cadre before going out, and guaranteeing to return on time, thus avoiding delays. In the past, one stretcher run lasting ten days was counted as one trip, and two or three days were also counted as one trip, which was unreasonable. Now, after discussion, it is stipulated that seven days is counted as one trip, less than three days is counted as half a trip, and four days or more is counted as one trip. 2. There are a total of eleven cart teams, of which three are long cart teams. Both cart dispatch and stretcher bearing are calculated as work points. In the past, there were two problems. First, there was a conflict between cart dispatch and stretcher bearing. After returning from stretcher bearing, those with livestock would still dispatch carts, resulting in more trips than households without livestock. Now, it is changed so that dispatching carts to the front also counts as stretcher bearing, with the same work point calculation method as stretcher bearing, but dispatching short carts in the rear only counts as half a stretcher run. Second, the handling method for households that should have fed their livestock but did not is divided into two situations: one is households that sold their livestock to avoid dispatch and bought a small livestock not suitable for dispatch, they are still assigned to the long cart team, and each time they are dispatched they must still send someone, and help with the fodder for one livestock, as a punishment for households avoiding dispatch; the other is households that genuinely cannot afford livestock, the village should discuss according to the different circumstances of each household, and酌予exempt them from dispatch or from a portion of the fodder. Regarding the issue of cultivation on behalf, the entire village has a total of eleven families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and a support-the-families-of-revolutionary-martyrs-and-soldiers team is established (including one team leader), and they are assigned to eleven livelihood teams. For families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers with more land, two teams cultivate on behalf of one household; for those with less land and less work, one team cultivates on behalf of two or three households. During busy times, a meeting is held every ten days, and each family of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers raises their need for cultivation on behalf at the meeting. After discussion by the team, the team leader raises it to the village cadre, who then arranges it to each team. Households with less work directly raise it to the cultivation-on-behalf team leader. It is also stipulated that the work of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers should be done first, ensuring that it is done well. Regarding the cultivation on behalf of households on duty, each time there is a dispatch, the village cadre, in addition to political mobilization, also solicits the opinions of each person on duty, asking what work needs to be done at home after they leave, and the village cadre immediately holds a meeting to discuss how to cultivate on behalf.

　　董胡王村改进支差工作
    细致规定计工办法
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】日前清丰董胡王村检查战勤工作后，特规定担架的合理计工办法和大车与担架的折工办法：一、担架的计工办法：八村自卫队员八十一人，从中抽出比较身强力壮的六十人，组织成四个担架小组，每组十五个人，组长一人，区里派担架时，就由自卫队长向各组派，如要一付，每组出两人；要两付每组出四人；轮流次序由各组长负责派，确定谁出发，外出时需要经过村干允许，并保证按时回来，这样免耽误时间。过去出一次担架十几天算一趟，两三天也算一趟，不合理；现在讨论规定七天算一趟，三天以下算半趟，够四天即算一趟。二、大车共十一组，其中三组是长车组，出车和出担架一概计工，过去有两个问题，第一出车和出担架矛盾，出了担架回来以后，因有牲口还出车，比无牲口户多出一趟；现在改为出车上前线也顶出担架，和出担架计工法一样，但在后方出短车一趟只算担架半趟。第二是对应该喂牲口而没有喂牲口的户处理办法，分两种情况：一种为了躲差卖掉牲口，另买一个不合支差的小牲口的户，仍然分到长车组，每次出差同样要去人，并帮一个牲口草料，表示对躲差户的惩罚；另一种是真买不起牲口的户，应根据各户不同的情况，由村讨论，酌予免出或不出一部分草料。代耕问题，全村共十一户抗属，成立抗属小组（内组长一人），分到十一个生活小组里，地多的抗属，两组代耕一户；地少活少的，一组代耕两三家。忙时十天开会一次，各抗属户在会上提出自己需要代耕，经小组讨论后，由组长向村干提出，再布置到各组。活少各户，直接向代耕组长提出。并规定抗属活先做，保证作的好。对出差户的代耕，每次出差时，村干除政冶动员外，还征求各出差人的意见，走后家里需作啥活，村干即马上开会讨论如何代耕。
