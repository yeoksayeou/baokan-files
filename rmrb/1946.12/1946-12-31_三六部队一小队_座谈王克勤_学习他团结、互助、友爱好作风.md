(Dispatch from the Jilu-Yu Bureau, this newspaper, the 29th) On the afternoon of the 20th, the headquarters of the First Squad of the Third Company and Sixth Battalion was crowded with all the branch committee members, group leaders, and activists of the squad for a forum on Wang Keqin. In a small house, everyone sat around a bonfire of corn stalks to keep warm. Although the weather was very cold, the discussions were extremely lively.

The Second Squad Leader, Wang Yuntai, was the first to speak up, saying, "When Wang Keqin was the squad leader, he cared about the soldiers and their families. Once, Du Shuangjian's older brother and Du Tongshun's father came to see them, and Wang Keqin took his own money to buy cigarettes and tofu, preparing good dishes to entertain the family members." Chen Wuying, the deputy platoon leader of the artillery platoon, added, "I used to be in the same squad as Wang Keqin. When he was a soldier, he was very good at uniting everyone. Whenever he heard someone say something unsatisfactory, he would automatically explain it, never following others in making indiscriminate remarks. When he was the squad leader and I was the deputy squad leader, he often told me, 'There are many comrades in our squad. When we sleep, we'll sleep in a bad place, and they'll sleep in a good place. We'll handle the difficult things, and they'll handle the easy things.' As a result, all the soldiers in the squad supported him."

Chen Meilin, the First Squad Leader of the rifle squad, was in the same squad as Wang Keqin in Chiang Kai-shek's 30th Army. Now they are in the same company. He often said that Wang Keqin used to have a bad temper, but after joining the Eighth Route Army, he became very amiable. Now that he is ill, he still constantly gathers the squad leaders to study their work and speaks to each squad. When everyone tells him to rest and recuperate, he says, "I am now leading four squads, and I don't want them to lag behind. Everyone must learn from the First Squad." During marches, he always walked at the back, and if anyone fell behind, he would carry their belongings for them. When the soldier Ren Yanru was unable to walk on the road, he carried his rifle and ammunition for him. Instructor Lin Qinfu said, "Once, the Second Squad was in a hurry to leave for something, and they hadn't finished making dumplings. He hadn't eaten yet, so he spent money to buy two catties of steamed buns and let everyone eat first, so they wouldn't go hungry. Another time, the higher-ups gave them two boxes of cigarettes, but he saw that it wasn't enough to distribute, so he bought two more boxes and gave one box to each squad. Wang Keqin cares so much about the soldiers that new soldiers all want to go to Wang Keqin's squad." Li Tieshu, the deputy leader of the First Machine Gun Squad, said, "Platoon Leader Wang often says that management and education cannot be resolved by losing one's temper, but by persuasion and education. New soldiers reflect that our platoon leader has no airs. He carries things like we do during marches. It's rare to meet such a platoon leader when you're a soldier." There were many people eager to speak, and there was no end to the admirable qualities of Comrade Wang Keqin. Finally, the Deputy Political Commissar of the 226th Unit said, "Among the more than one million soldiers in the People's Liberation Army, there are many who are more outstanding in combat than Wang Keqin's squad, but there are not many who are as comprehensive as Wang Keqin's squad in terms of unity between new and old soldiers, mutual assistance and learning, army-civilian relations, and officer-soldier relations. However, there will definitely be better squads than Wang Keqin's squad in the future. Therefore, in carrying out the Wang Keqin Movement, we must not be complacent, but strive for progress. If every squad in the more than one million troops could be like Wang Keqin's squad, then Chiang Kai-shek would definitely collapse even faster. In the future, there will be even more soldiers liberated from Chiang Kai-shek's army, and Wang Keqin is their role model." Finally, the Deputy Political Commissar emphasized, "The Wang Keqin direction is the direction of the company's work in the future, and everyone must strive to learn from him."

　　三六部队一小队
    座谈王克勤
    学习他团结、互助、友爱好作风
    【本报冀鲁豫廿九日电】廿日下午，三六部一小队队部拥挤着全队支委、小组长及活动分子，座谈王克勤。在一座小屋子里，围在玉黍秸的烟火堆旁烤火，虽然天气很冷，但发言极为热烈。
    二班长王云太首先抢着说：“王克勤当班长时候不久，对战士关心，对家属也很关心，有一回杜双建的哥哥和杜同顺的父亲来看他们，王克勤把自己的钱拿来买烟买豆腐，作好菜招待家属。”炮班副班长陈武英作补充发言：“我从前和王克勤在一班，他当战士时候对大家团结非常好，见到有人说不满意话，就自动解释，决不随着别人乱讲。他当班长，我当副班长，他常对我讲，咱班内同志多，睡觉时咱睡个坏地方，他们睡好地方。难办的事咱们办，好办的事交他们办，因此全班战士都拥护他。”
    步枪一班长陈美林在蒋军三十军时，曾和王克勤同班，现在同连，他常说王克勤过去脾气坏，到八路军后变得很和气。现在他病了，还是不断集合班长研究工作，到各班讲话。大家说“你养病吧！”他说：“我现在带了四个班，我也不愿他落后，都要向一班学习。行军时他总是走在后面，谁掉了队就给谁背东西，战士任彦茹路上走不动他替他把枪枝子弹都扛上。指导员林钦福同志说：有一回二班急着有事要出发，饺子没包好，他还没吃上，他便出钱买来二斤馍，让大家先吃，不让挨饿。又一次上级发他们两盒烟，他看不够分配，又买了两盒分给每班一盒。王克勤这样关心战士，所以新战士都愿到王克勤班去。机枪一班副李铁秀说：“王排长常说管理教育和发脾气解决不了问题，全靠说服教育，不说不服，新战士反映我们排长没架子，行军跟我们一样背东西，当兵可难遇到这样一个排长。”争着发言的人很多，王克勤同志值得学习的地方是说不完的。最后二二六部队×副政委说：“全国一百多万人民解放军，打仗比王克勤班出色的很多，但要从新老战士团结，互助学习，军民关系，官兵关系上都像王克勤班这样齐全的却不多，但今后一定会出现比王克勤班更好的，因此在开展王克勤运动中，切不可自满，要努力进步，假若一百多万军队每个班都能像王克勤班那样，那蒋介石就一定垮得更快，今后从蒋军解放来的战士更要多，王克勤就是他们的榜样。”最后×副政委着重指出：“王克勤方向就是今后连队工作的方向，大家要努力学习他”。
