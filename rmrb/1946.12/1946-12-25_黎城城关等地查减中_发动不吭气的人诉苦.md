　　[This newspaper reported] During the land reform in Licheng Chengguan, Tinghepu and other places, backward masses who had not been thoroughly liberated for many years and had been silent for many years were mobilized to speak of their suffering and settle accounts. At the Chengguan Speak Bitterness and Settle Accounts Conference on the 12th of this month, Han Hutang, whose family was ruined by the exploitation and oppression of the local tyrant landlord Yang Yongchang, burst into tears and poured out thirty years of bitterness accumulated in his heart. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, Hutang's father rented sixty acres of bad land from Yang Yongchang. After planting for only one season, he could not pay the eighteen large dan of rent, and was sent to the yamen by Yang. In the end, nine acres of the fourteen acres of land that he had worked hard to acquire were seized by Yang. Without food or drink, Hutang's four brothers were forced to become soldiers, and the youngest brother starved to death. He cried bitterly, "He harmed five of my brothers, leaving only me. This time, we must settle this old score!" After he spoke of his suffering, Ma Changping and others also rushed to pour out the bitterness that had been in their hearts for many years. At the meeting in Tinghepu to settle accounts with the local tyrant landlord Wang Sanbao, backward farmers who had never spoken up in the movement came forward to make accusations. Yang Chou said, "In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, stubborn troops passing through here poured two buckets of kerosene into his wheat stack. He insisted that I had poured it and forced me to sell my land, wife, and children to compensate him. When I refused, he tied my ten fingers and hung me in the Great Temple." Filled with anger, he slapped the tyrant Wang Sanbao a few times. Then Xing Ruyi, Wang Guangwen, and eighteen other honest farmers recounted fifteen illegal acts of oppression and exploitation by Wang Sanbao. Xing Ruyi said, "From the twentieth year of the Republic of China, I cooked for Wang Sanbao for three years. The total wage was fifty-four yuan, but he exploited fifty-two yuan and did not pay me. According to the land price at that time, it could buy three acres of land, which could produce three shi of grain each year. Now, after fifteen years, it should be a total of forty-five shi of grain. Now he should compensate me." The masses unanimously agreed that Ruyi's calculation was fair and reasonable, and Wang had to lower his head and admit his mistake, acknowledging compensation for the losses. After the meeting, the old rich peasant Wang Wanhe said, "In the past, I thought that land reform was just about drying up the old rich, but now I see that it is about settling accounts reasonably!"

　　黎城城关等地查减中
    发动不吭气的人诉苦
    【本报讯】黎城城关、停河铺等地查减中发动多年未翻透身及多年未吭气的落后群众诉苦清算。本月十二日城关诉苦清算大会上，被恶霸地主杨永昌剥削、压迫以致家破人亡的韩虎堂，涕泪交流，倒出积压心里三十年的苦水。民国五年虎堂父亲租种杨永昌六十亩坏地，刚种一季，交不够十八大石租子，被杨送进衙门，最后辛勤置下的十四亩地被杨霸去九亩，无吃无喝，虎堂弟兄四人被迫当兵，小兄弟活活饿死。他痛哭着说：“我兄弟五个，被他害得只剩我一个了，这回可要把这老账算清！”他诉苦后，马长平等也抢着倒出窝在心里多年的苦水。停河铺清算恶霸地主王三保的大会上，从来在运动中不吭气的落后农民都纷纷提出控诉。杨丑则说：“民国二十六年，路过这里的顽固军给他倒了两桶煤油在麦囤里，他硬说是我倒的，逼着要我卖掉土地、老婆、孩子来赔他，我不肯，就把我十个指头捆住吊在大庙里。”他气愤填胸，给了恶霸王三保几个耳光。接着邢如意、王光文等十八个老实农民诉出王三保的十五件非法压迫、剥削事实。邢如意说：“民国二十年起我给王三保做了三年饭，工钱共五十四元，他就剥削了五十二元没给，按当时地价算，能买三亩地，每年能打三石谷，到如今十五年了，共该四十五石谷，现在他应赔我。”群众一致认为如意算账公道合理，王只得低头认错，承认赔偿损失。会后，老富农王晚和说：“过去我认为查减就是把老财弄干，原来是合理算账哩！”
