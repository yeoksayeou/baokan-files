    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th] The Preparatory Committee of the China Liberated Area Youth Federation recently announced the following slogans commemorating the "December 9th" and "December 1st" Movements:
    (1) Commemorate "December 9th" and "December 1st", inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of "December 9th" and "December 1st", and fight to the end for the complete liberation of the people, for the realization of a New Democratic China, and for a peaceful, democratic, and independent New China!
    (2) Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, and abolish the traitorous Chiang-American Commercial Treaty! Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship, and demand the immediate dissolution of the illegal puppet National Assembly! Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's launching of a civil war and massacring the people. Youths across the country must take action to stop Chiang Kai-shek's army from attacking the liberated areas!
    (3) Oppose the comprehensive political and economic aggression of American imperialism, protest the atrocities of the American military, and demand that the American military immediately withdraw from China!
    (4) Support the struggle of the people of Shanghai for freedom and survival, and help all struggles for survival and freedom across the country! Punish the executioners who massacre the people, and end the rule of the executioners!
    (5) Youth friends in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, rise up and unite under the banner of democracy! "December 9th" is not over, and the bloodstains of "December 1st" are not yet dry. Take action quickly to strive for national liberation, the realization of a democratic coalition government, and our stable life, guaranteed employment, and freedom to study. Demand that Chiang Kai-shek put down his bloody hands of slaughter, and use action and strength to shatter Chiang Kai-shek's autocratic dreams!
    (6) Youth comrades in the liberated areas, mobilize more urgently! Participate more diligently in the work of the self-defense war, and go more bravely to the people's army, to defend our land and homeland, to defend the liberated areas, to defend Yan'an, and to defend Chairman Mao!
    (7) Youths across the country, unite! Fight for the complete liberation of all the people! Fight for the democratic rights of all the people! Fight for the peace and happiness of all the people!
    Long live "December 9th"! Long live "December 1st"! Long live national independence! Long live democracy and freedom! Long live the people's well-being!
    Long live the united front of national patriotism! Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!
    Long live the victory of the Chinese people's self-defense war!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd] The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Area Youth Federation recently told reporters: "This year's commemoration of the two youth festivals in December, 'December 9th' and 'December 1st', has special significance. Today, Chiang Kai-shek has sold out national sovereignty by signing the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty, preparing to attack Yan'an, continuing to expand the civil war, and convening an illegal National Assembly, attempting to maintain his dictatorial rule. The youth in the Chiang-controlled areas are unemployed and unable to attend school, persecuted by secret agents, drafted into the army, and their thinking is controlled. Their personal freedom is not guaranteed at all, which is even more serious than the 'December 9th' ten years ago and the 'December 1st' a year ago. However, the strength of the Chinese people is also stronger, and the vast number of young people are more awakened. On the occasion of the commemorative days of 'December 9th' and 'December 1st', we Chinese youth should inherit the glorious traditions of 'December 9th' and 'December 1st', complete the unfinished tasks of 'December 9th' and 'December 1st', oppose the aggression of American imperialism, oppose the traitorous Chiang-American Commercial Treaty signed by Chiang Kai-shek, demand the immediate dissolution of the illegal and divisive National Assembly convened by Chiang Kai-shek, and use all our strength to smash Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the liberated areas, in order to commemorate these two festivals with practical actions." The person in charge of the Liberated Area Youth Federation finally said: The Yan'an youth community has organized a preparatory committee to commemorate "December 9th" and "December 1st", with He Qijun as the director of the preparatory committee, and a commemorative meeting will be held in the coming days.

    （二）反对蒋介石卖国，废除卖国的蒋美商约！反对蒋介石独裁，要求立即解散非法的伪国大！反对蒋介石进行内战屠杀人民，全国青年行动起来，制止蒋介石军队进攻解放区！

    【新华社延安三日电】解放区青联筹委会负责人顷对记者称：“今年纪念十二月中两个青年节日“一二九”与“一二一”，有特殊意义。今天蒋介石出卖了国家主权，签订了蒋美商约，准备进攻延安，继续扩大内战，并召开非法国大，企图维持其独裁统治。蒋管区的青年失业与失学，被特务迫害，被抓去当兵，思想受到统制，人身自由毫无保障，比起十年前的一二九，比起一年前的一二一，更加严重了；但是中国人民的力量也更加强大，广大青年也更加有了觉醒。值此“一二九”“一二一”的纪念日之际，我们中国青年应继承“一二九”“一二一”的光荣传统，完成“一二九”“一二一”的未竟的任务，反对美帝国主义的侵略，反对蒋介石所签定的卖国的蒋美商约，要求立即解散蒋介石所召开的非法的分裂的国大，用一切力量粉碎蒋介石对于解放区的进攻，以实际行动来纪念这两个节日。”解放区青联会负责人最后称：延安青年界已经组织了纪念“一二九”“一二一”的筹备会，以何启君为筹备会主任，将于日内举行纪念大会。
