Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Moscow Radio reported on the 21st that the American industrialists' newspaper, "The Wall Street Journal," expressed concern about the possibility of an economic crisis in the United States. Many industrial sectors have recently reached a level of overproduction.

Earlier, the London correspondent of "World News," published in Washington, reported that as early as the late summer and autumn of this year, "London expected the United States to be heading for a serious business depression. Some economists, politicians, and businessmen believe that the American economy will head for a major collapse." The correspondent pointed out that Labor Party writer Cook, based on the prediction of Soviet economic authority Varga, determined that the United States would be hit by a recession. Labor Party member Walber also predicted that the United States would one day be forced to export goods as much as possible in order to maintain domestic production and employment levels. In the British Parliament debates, there were also several speeches that mentioned the American economic panic. Member Walker warned at the Labor Party annual meeting: "Do not underestimate the great danger of American overproduction!" The correspondent continued: "Britain fears an American economic depression because it is generally believed that this depression will seriously affect Britain's economic recovery... Some people believe that during the depression, the United States will dump goods on a large scale all over the world. In this case, Britain will lose the world market at the time when it most needs the world market to support its economy." The correspondent concluded: "Given that an American economic panic is inevitable, there is a tendency in Britain to avoid being too closely politically linked to the United States, although it is not very large now; but many political party members oppose a close Anglo-American alliance. Some Labor Party members say so, but most are unwilling to say so publicly."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: London News: After British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned from New York, the cabinet immediately convened a meeting on the 20th to study the opposition of Labor Party members to the current foreign policy in mid-October and countermeasures, and to prepare a report on the two major New York conferences. It is reported that Bevin defended his policies at the meeting. According to a United Press reporter, "Bevin believes that the New York conference is an answer to these members' criticisms." Another important member of the British cabinet, Morrison (Speaker of the House), took a reserved attitude.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Various reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Foreign Secretary Bevin and his party arrived in England by ship on the 20th, five days after leaving New York. Molotov flew from London to Moscow on the same day. After Bevin arrived in London, he held talks with Attlee. It is reported that Bevin will probably not take a vacation and will go to the Foreign Office to deal with urgent issues such as Palestine, Egypt, and Spain.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: London News: The Speaker of the British House of Commons announced on the 19th that the British request for the Soviet Union to send a delegation from the Supreme Soviet to visit Britain has been accepted by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The British House of Commons visited the Soviet Union in February 1945 at the invitation of the Soviet government and decided to exchange visits.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: London News: The British business delegation to China, headed by Bowes, returned here on the 19th.

    很多英国人士反对英美联盟
    贝文自纽约返国后英内阁立即召开会议
    研讨工党议员对现行外交政策的反对案
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据莫斯科二十一日广播：美国实业家机关报《华尔街新闻》对美国可能发生经济危机表示忧虑。许多工业部门最近已达到生产过剩的水平。
    前此华府出版之《世界新闻》驻伦敦记者曾报导，远在今年夏秋之交，“伦敦方面预料美国刻正走向一个严重的商业萧条。有些经济学者政界人士和商人，认为美国经济将走向大暴落。”该记者指出工党刊物作家库克根据苏联经济学权威瓦尔加氏之预言而断定，美国将为不景气所打击。工党议员华尔贝亦预言，美国将有一天被迫尽力输出货物，以保持国内生产水平及就业水平。在英国国会辩论中，亦有好几篇演说，谈到美国经济恐慌。议员瓦尔克曾在工党年会上警告：“不要低估美国生产过剩的极大危险！”该记者继称：“英国惧怕美国经济萧条，还因为一般咸信此萧条一定会严重影响英国的经济复员……。有些人认为萧条期间美国将大举向世界各地倾销。在此种情况下，英国将在最需要世界市场以支持其经济之时失去世界市场。”该记者结语称：“鉴于美国经济恐慌必将到来，英国有一种避免和美国政治联系过于密切之趋势，虽然现在还不大；但已有很多政党人士反对英美密切联盟。某些工党议员说是如此，但多数人不愿意公开地这样讲。”
    【新华社延安二十二日电】伦敦讯：英外相贝文自纽约返国后，内阁立即于二十日召开会议，研讨十月中旬工党议员对现行外交政策之反对案与对策问题，并准备关于纽约两大会议的报告。据悉：贝文在会议中为自己的政策辩护。据合众社记者称：“贝文认为纽约会议就是对于这些议员的批评之回答。”而英阁另一要员莫理逊（下院议长）则持保留态度。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】各方报导：苏外长莫洛托夫及英外相贝文等一行在离开纽约五日之后，已于二十日同轮抵英。莫氏已于同日自伦敦飞往莫斯科。贝文抵伦敦后，即与艾德礼进行谈话。据悉：贝文大概不会休假，将前往外交部处理诸如巴勒斯坦、埃及及西班牙等紧急问题。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】伦敦消息：英下院议长于十九日发表英国要求苏联派最高苏维埃代表团访英的事，已为苏最高苏维埃主席团主席所接受。按英国下院曾于一九四五年二月应苏政府之邀请游历苏联，并曾决定相互聘问。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】伦敦讯：以鲍埃斯为首之英国商务访华团已于十九日返抵此间。
