　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd: The local armed forces and militia of the New Fourth Army in southern Jiangsu, taking advantage of the Chiang army's northward invasion of Yancheng, launched a full-scale offensive. In the half-month up to the 14th of this month, more than forty Chiang army strongholds were removed. Now, east of the Fan Gong Dike and north of the Rugao-Juegang Highway, there are no enemy traces in the vast area of 16,000 square miles. West of the Fan Gong Dike and east of the Grand Canal, the newly recovered towns include Su Town and Xilai in Jingjiang, Fenjie and Dongxi Guanzhuang in Taixing, Yingwen, Dalun, Yunlianghe, Jiangduo, and Baimi in Taixian, Daduo, Zhuhuanggang, Zhongdi, and Duyan in Xinghua, and Lucun and Shagou in Baoying. Over 260 Chiang army "Homecoming Corps" members below the rank of company commander were killed or captured, and six light machine guns, over thirty rifles, and over forty ammunition and grain boats were seized, and one car was destroyed. Chiang's military strength is extremely empty, with only the city and Xibao in Xinghua County remaining as Chiang army strongholds. Local armed forces and militia in the Jiangdu, Gaoyou, and Baoying areas have taken the initiative and report victories daily. The military and civilians in Dongtai and Tai(bei) also sabotaged the Chiang army's vital transportation line for the northward invasion, the Hai'an-Liuzhuang Highway. On the 7th and 10th, north and south of Baiju Town (north of Dongtai), one Chiang army car was destroyed, three large ships were intercepted, and seventeen boxes of shells were seized. The counter-"encirclement and suppression" campaign in the Nantong, Rugao, and Haimen areas has achieved initial victories. In addition to recovering seven key towns such as Matang east of Rugao, the Chiang army's "Homecoming Corps" has been compressed into several isolated strongholds such as Haimen, Qidong, and Shigang.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd: Sima Long, a special correspondent of this agency, commented on the intense guerrilla warfare in central Jiangsu, saying: "Just as the Chiang army was piecing together all its strength to invade Yancheng from the north, the local armed forces and militia of the New Fourth Army in central Jiangsu launched a full-scale offensive in the rear of the Chiang army and achieved repeated victories. Such important strongholds as Dabaimi in Taixian, Juegang and Matang east of Rugao, and Fenjie and Dongxi Guanzhuang in Taixing were all removed one by one. This shows, on the one hand, the emptiness of the Chiang army's military strength, such as in Haimen, where only one squadron of the security team and a police brigade of eighty-odd people were stationed after the departure of the independent regiment of the First Pacification Zone; on the other hand, it is due to the considerable development of the local armed forces and militia of the New Fourth Army, who can not only strike at the Chiang army's harassment but also remove the Chiang army's strongholds; not only can they fight the local thugs of the "Homecoming Corps," but they can also choose favorable opportunities to annihilate the enemy's main force. For example, in the Tangjiayuan battle east of Rugao, our local militia annihilated more than 160 remnants of the 79th Brigade of the 49th Division of the Chiang army in one fell swoop. Facts have proved that when the guerrillas have a main force, they are the best assistant to the main force; when the main force leaves temporarily, they are the most reliable protector of the people."

　　苏中南线敌后空虚
    我军全面出击
    克据点四十余
    【新华社华中二十二日电】苏中新四军地方武装与民兵，乘蒋军北犯盐城之际，展开全面出击。截至本月十四日止之半个月内，拔除蒋军据点四十余处，现范公堤以东，如（皋）掘（港）公路以北之一万六千方里广大地区内已无敌踪。范公堤以西，运河线以东地区，新近恢复之市镇计有靖江之粟镇、西来，泰兴之分界、东西官庄，泰县之营温、大伦、运粮河、蒋垛、白米，兴化之大垛、竹黄港、中堤、都堰，宝应之芦村及沙沟等，毙俘蒋军“还乡团”连长以下二百六十余名，缴获轻机枪六挺，步枪三十余枝，弹药、粮船四十余支，毁汽车一辆。蒋军兵力异常空虚，兴化县境仅余城厢及西鲍两蒋军据点。江都、高邮、宝应地区地方武装与民兵，已掌握主动权，每日奏捷。东台及台北军民并破坏蒋军北犯之交通命脉海安至刘庄公路。七日和十日于白驹镇（东台北）南北，毁蒋军汽车一辆，截获大船三只，炮弹十七箱。南通、如皋、海门地区之反“清剿”，已获初次胜利，除收复如（皋）东之马塘等七重镇外，并将蒋军“还乡团”压缩至海门、启东及石港等几个孤立据点内。
    【新华社华中二十二日电】本社特派记者司马龙评苏中如火如荼的游击战称：“正当蒋军拚凑全力北犯盐城之际，苏中新四军地方武装、民兵即在蒋军后方全线出击，迭获胜利，这样重要的据点如泰县的大白米，如皋东之掘港、马塘、泰兴之分界、东西官庄，均一一被拔除。这一方面说明了蒋军兵力的空虚，如海门自从第一绥靖区独立团出动后，只留保安队一个中队及警察大队八十余人驻守；另一方面则由于新四军地方武装与民兵力量有了可观的发展，他们不仅能打击蒋军出扰，而且能拔除蒋军的据点；不仅能打地头蛇“还乡团”，而且能选择有利时机歼灭敌军主力。如皋东汤家园战斗时，我当地民兵一举歼灭蒋军四十九师七十九旅残部一百六十余人即是一例。事实证明，游击队当有主力的时候，他是主力最好的助手；当主力暂时离开的时候，他又是人民的最可靠的卫护者”。
