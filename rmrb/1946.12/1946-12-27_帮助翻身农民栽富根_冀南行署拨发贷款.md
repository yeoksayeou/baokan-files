　　To help liberated peasants plant the roots of wealth and lay the foundation for large-scale production next year, the Jinnan Administrative Office has allocated 400 million yuan from the Jinnan Bank to provide targeted loans to four types of areas: those affected by natural disasters, those with relatively developed handicraft industries, those where mass movements have passed and shifted to production, and impoverished villages that did not receive fruits of the struggle during the mass movement. The aim is to support winter sideline occupations. Generally, each household receives between 1,000 and 10,000 yuan. The first batch of sideline occupation loans, totaling 150 million yuan, has already been distributed to various counties. The second batch of 250 million yuan will be distributed to various sub-districts immediately, with 40 million yuan each for the first and third sub-districts, 35 million yuan for the second sub-district, 46 million yuan for the fourth sub-district, and 30 million yuan for the fifth sub-district. The remaining 9 million yuan is planned to be lent to larger-scale agricultural tool iron factories and paper mills to mass-produce necessary agricultural tools, vigorously promote the development of textiles, improve backward tools, and improve production quality. This will enable the vast number of peasants to obtain profits to meet the spring famine and solve the problems of agricultural tools, draught cattle, seeds, and fertilizers before spring plowing, in order to support the victory of the self-defense war.
