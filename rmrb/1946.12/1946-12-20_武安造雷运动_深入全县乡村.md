　　Wu'an Landmine Creation Movement Penetrates Throughout the County's Villages
    [Our dispatch] When the masses in various districts of Wu'an County learned that the Chiang troops had once again begun to attack the Ping-Han Railway Line, a landmine creation movement sprang up. The county headquarters and the county military committee issued explosion instructions, and each district immediately established explosion training classes. The Third District's explosion training class, with 140 people, learned more than 30 kinds of landmine creation and mine-laying methods in seven days. Other explosion training classes learned at least ten kinds of mine-laying and two kinds of landmine creation methods. After the first phase of explosion training classes, many villages established explosion teams. The county headquarters' rotating blasting team personally went to various places with explosives, steel drills and other tools to help the militiamen install and bury landmines, demonstrating the power of the landmines on the spot for everyone to see. The militiamen of Dian Village in the Second District were initially not very interested in creating "mines," but when they witnessed the good explosive power, they hammered away non-stop to create stone mines. Within three days, more than ten nearby villages also started to create "mines" under their influence. In less than half a month, the Fourth District created ×××× stone mines and ××× iron mines. The First District of Wu'an City created many bottle mines. Si Jie prepared more than 200 tread boards and many detonator materials. The Wuhe Township of the Third District has already produced enough explosives to fill 1,000 landmines. (Taihang Third Sub-district Military Affairs Communications Group)
    [Our dispatch] In Pengcheng, a famous porcelain industry town in Ci County, under the leadership of the county trade union, more than 600 workers and peasants have joined the militia and armed themselves. They are now polishing their guns and sharpening their knives, stepping up military training day and night. In addition to the existing ×× iron mines, they are still rushing to make stone mines.

　　武安造雷运动  深入全县乡村
    【本报讯】武安县各区群众，当闻悉蒋军又一次开始进攻平汉线后，造雷运动蜂起。县指挥部与县武委会颁发爆炸指示，各区即成立爆炸训练班。三区爆训班一百四十人，在七天中即学习造雷、埋雷办法三十余种。其他爆训班顶少也学会十种埋雷及两种造雷方法。第一期爆训班结束后，许多村都成立了爆炸小组。县指挥部轮炸队带着炸药钢钻等工具亲赴各地帮助民兵装雷、埋雷，当场试验地雷的威力给大家看。二区店村民兵开始对造“雷”兴趣不大，但当其目睹爆炸威力良好时，便手不停锤的赶造石雷。三天之内，附近十余村庄也在其影响下造起“雷”来了。不及半月，四区即造出石雷××××颗、铁雷×××颗。武安城关一区创造出瓶子雷多枚。四街准备好二百多个踏板及许多雷管材料。三区五和乡已造出足够装一千个雷的炸药。（太行三分武通讯小组）
    【本报讯】著名瓷业重镇——磁县彭城群众，在县工会领导下，六百余工人农民，已参加民兵，武装起来，现已擦枪磨刀，日夜加紧练武，除已有之铁雷××颗外尚在赶制石雷。
