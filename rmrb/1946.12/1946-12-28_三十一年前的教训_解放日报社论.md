Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 25th: *Liberation Daily* published an editorial today entitled "The Lesson of Thirty-One Years Ago" in commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising. The main points of the article are as follows:

　　Today is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. Revisiting this period of history has particularly profound practical significance for all Chinese people and today's traitorous dictators.

　　Wasn't Yuan Shikai formidable and arrogant back then! Holding a "legal" government recognized by various countries, possessing hundreds of thousands of "national troops," and with special agent claws spread all over the provinces; he controlled the national financial resources and means of transportation. In order to obtain foreign aid, he signed the Twenty-One Demands, a traitorous treaty. He trotted out a whole set of deceptive democratic methods, convened a fake "National Assembly," fabricated the Temple of Heaven Constitution, changed the undisguised pro-monarchy Preparatory Society into a "Constitutional Advancement Association," unscrupulously destroyed the then democratic provisional constitution, dissolved the then parliament composed of various parties, assassinated democrats, and launched armed attacks on democratic forces. Yuan Shikai thought that with all this, he would definitely be able to "don the yellow robe and reign for ten thousand generations." But when he triumphantly sat on the throne, he immediately discovered his extreme isolation. Amidst the opposition of the people and the calls for the "National Protection Army" to punish him, even his most trusted subordinates rose up against him. Thus, this "Hongxian Emperor," who had once dominated the scene, fell.

　　This period of history best proves that in the age of people's democracy, anyone who betrays national interests and goes against the people's will, no matter how much foreign support and strength he temporarily possesses, he is just a paper tiger and will eventually be exposed. Thirty-one years later, Jiang Jieshi, this paper tiger, relying on his American daddy, also wants to "don the yellow robe" and carry out his fascist dictatorship of "reigning for ten thousand generations." Thus, like Yuan Shikai, on the one hand, he signed the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" and the "Sino-American Aviation Agreement," even more ruthless than the Twenty-One Demands, completely selling out our country's territorial sovereignty to American imperialism; on the other hand, he recklessly launched a civil war, suppressed the people's democratic forces, assassinated democratic movement fighters, and copied Yuan Shikai's entire set of convening a fake "National Assembly" and creating a fake constitution. Jiang Jieshi's autocratic and traitorous behavior, isolating himself from the people, if he continues to be stubborn and unrepentant, his fate will certainly follow Yuan Shikai's footsteps, and that is certain.

　　The history of thirty-one years ago should also further strengthen the Chinese people's confidence in victory. Back then, Yuan Shikai held the country's "legal" regime and military power, and also had the help of imperialism; while the forces opposing the monarchy were limited to a corner of the southwest. At the beginning of the National Protection Army's uprising, there were only sixteen or seventeen thousand people in total, not even a fraction of Yuan's army. But precisely because the Yunnan Uprising was a patriotic and just cause, it immediately received the response and support of the people across the country, and quickly overthrew Yuan's traitorous and autocratic rule. Today, the Chinese people hate Jiang Jieshi's reactionary clique's traitorous and dictatorial rule even more bitterly, and the strength of the Chinese people is many times greater than it was thirty-one years ago. The Chinese people's cause of independence and democracy will surely achieve victory.

　　The history of thirty-one years ago also tells us that when Yuan Shikai finally insisted on implementing the imperial system, even Yuan's associates joined the anti-Yuan united front at the time, which included the Yunnan local faction, the Constitutionalists, the Political Studies Clique, the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and other non-partisan individuals. In particular, the military and political authorities of various provinces, after the Yunnan Uprising, successively declared independence. In the provinces directly controlled by Yuan, such as Shandong, Shanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Fengtian, anti-Yuan movements were also launched one after another, contributing to the collapse of Yuan's imperial system. Today, Jiang Jieshi's brazenly reversing the course of history will further arouse public outrage across the country. Figures within the Kuomintang who are loyal to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit and patriotic soldiers in various places should, like General Cai E back then, rise up to save the country, participate in the patriotic and democratic united front, support the Political Consultative Conference line, and oppose Jiang Jieshi's traitorous dictatorship.

　　Thirty-one years have passed, and we extend our highest respect to the patriots and martyrs who participated in this righteous act! It should be particularly pointed out that General Zhu De, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army today, was one of the initiators of the uprising. He led the Third and Sixth Mixed Brigades of the First Army of the uprising army, fought in Sichuan and Yunnan, and his bloody battle at Mianhuapo for forty-six days and nights played a huge role in the campaign against Yuan. For thirty-one years, Commander-in-Chief Zhu has inherited the glorious tradition of the National Protection Army, created and strengthened the Chinese people's army, and continuously attacked and defeated imperialist aggressors and reactionaries. This is the supreme glory of the Chinese people. If the National Protection Army was able to defeat Yuan Shikai thirty-one years ago, then today, under the command of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country will surely be able to crush Jiang Jieshi's offensive and complete China's independence, democracy, and true peace. There is absolutely no doubt about it.

### 三十一年前的教训  解放日报社论

　　三十一年前的教训  解放日报社论
    【新华社延安二十五日电】解放日报于今日发表题为“三十一年前的教训”之社论，以纪念云南起义。该文大要如下：
    今天是云南起义纪念日，重温这一段历史，对全中国人民和今天的卖国独裁者都有特别深刻的现实意义。
    当年的袁世凯岂不是威风凛凛、不可一世！把把持着各国承认的“合法”政府，拥有几十万“国军”，特务爪牙满布全国各省；他掌握着全国财源和交通工具。他为了取得外援，就签订了二十一条卖国条约，就搬出全套伪装民主的手法，召开了伪“国民代表大会”，伪造了天坛宪法，把露骨准备帝制的筹安会改为“宪政协进会”，毫无忌惮地破坏了当时的民主约法，解散了当时各党派组成的国会，暗杀民主人士，武装进攻民主势力。袁世凯自以为靠着这一切，就一定可以“黄袍加身，万世一系”了。但当他得意忘形地坐上御座之后，立即发现自己的极端孤立，在全国人民的反对和“护国军”的讨伐声中，连他最亲信的部下也起来反对。于是这一位曾经叱咤风云的“洪宪皇帝”便倒下去了。
    这一段历史，最好地证明了在人民民主世纪，谁要出卖民族利益，违背人民意志，任凭他一时拥有多大的外援实力，他只不过是只纸老虎，最后终是要被戳破的。三十一年后的今天，蒋介石这一只纸老虎靠着他的美国爸爸，也想“黄袍加身”，干他“万世一系”的法西斯独裁，于是也像袁世凯一样，一面签订比二十一条更狠的“中美商约”、“中美航空协定”，把我国的领土主权彻底出卖给美帝国主义；另一面放手大打内战，镇压人民民主势力，暗杀民主运动斗士，把袁世凯的召开伪“国大”制造伪宪法那一套，统统如法泡制。蒋介石这样专制卖国自绝国人，如其继续执迷不悟，结局一定踏袁世凯的覆辙，那是可以肯定的了。
    三十一年前的历史，同时应该更加坚定中国人民的胜利信心。当年袁世凯握有全国的“合法”政权与军权，还有帝国主义的帮助；而反对帝制的力量只局限西南一隅，护国军初起时，总共只有一万六七千人，不抵袁军几十分之一。但是正因为云南起义是爱国正义的事业，便立即得到了全国人民的响应与拥护，很快的推翻了袁氏的卖国专制统治。今天中国人民对于蒋介石反动集团的卖国独裁统治，更加切齿痛恨，而中国人民的力量不知比三十一年前大了多少倍，中国人民的独立民主事业是一定能得到胜利的。
    三十一年前的历史又告诉我们，当袁世凯最后坚持实行帝制之时，即是袁氏的左右，也都纷纷加入当时包括云南地方派、立宪派、政学系、中华革命党和其他无党无派人士所组成的反袁统一战线。尤其是各省军政当局，在云南起义后，都先后宣布独立，在袁氏直接控制的山东、山西、湖北、江西、江苏、奉大诸省，也纷纷发动反袁运动，促成了袁氏帝制的破灭。今天蒋介石悍然倒行逆施，将更加激起全国人民的公愤。国民党内忠实于中山先生革命精神的人士和各地爱国军人，就应该像当年蔡松坡将军一样，奋起救国，参加爱国民主的统一战线，拥护政协路线，反对蒋介石卖国独裁。
    三十一年过去了，我们对当年参加这一次义举的志士与烈士们，谨致崇高的敬意！特别应该指出，今天中国人民解放军的总司令朱德将军，就是当年起义的发动者之一，他率领了起义军第一军的第三和第六混成支队，转战川滇，其在棉花坡一役，血战四十六昼夜，对讨袁之役起了极大作用。三十一年来，朱总司令继承了护国军的光荣传统，创造了和壮大了中国人民的军队，不断地打击了和战胜了帝国主义侵略者和反动派，这是中国人民的无上光荣。在三十一年前，护国军既能打垮袁世凯，那么今天在朱总司令统率下的人民解放军和全国人民，就一定能够粉碎蒋介石的进攻，完成中国的独立、民主与真正的和平，是决然无疑的了。
