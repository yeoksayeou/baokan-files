After Reading "China's Four Big Families"

	It took me seven days to read "China's Four Big Families" twice in a row. Although it was still a bit of a superficial reading, I gained a lot ideologically.

	The first gain is a clearer and more definite understanding of the essence of Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule. This is a small group of comprador, feudal, military, and financial oligarchs who rely on dictatorial and autocratic politics to plunder wealth. The masters of the four big families "directly concentrated the military, party, secret service, political, and financial power of the Kuomintang regime, forming a feudal comprador fascist oligarchic dictatorship system with the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang as its political form." In finance, they controlled the four major "national banks": the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, as the main blood-sucking vessels, using autocratic political power to issue "legal tender" indiscriminately to seize the people's materials. In commerce, they used fascist administrative organs such as the "Trade Commission" and "Monopoly Bureau" to implement "the most centralized public commercial monopoly in history" and the barbaric plunder of buying cheap and selling dear. In industry, they implemented monopoly control, strangled national industry, acted as the chief comprador for American goods, and turned China into "America's industrial frontier." In agriculture, they plundered and concentrated land, established the "Central Cooperative Treasury" and "Agricultural and Commercial Bank," using requisition, purchase, and agricultural loans to suck every drop of blood and sweat from the peasants, promoting the overall collapse of the agricultural economy. In culture, they monopolized and suppressed, and in life, they were more extravagant than emperors of past dynasties. In short, the author gave a clear anatomical chart of this poisonous and corrupt blood-sucking organization of the Chiang family court and wrote a concise growth history, so that I no longer have any illusions about the nature of this rule. In the past, especially during the period of cooperative resistance and political consultation, I had even considered whether the rulers such as Chiang Kai-shek had revolutionary characteristics. After reading this book, it was like examining a sample of feces under a microscope. Apart from the stench and reactionary germs, I could see nothing else.

	The second gain is the clear knowledge that Chiang Kai-shek and the four big families under his "leadership" all started with "a pair of bloody hands" and took launching an anti-people civil war as the main means of selling out the country and making a fortune, which truly unloaded the burden of peaceful illusions from me. The reason why the four big families have "risen to prominence" in the past nineteen years is that they were "created by the bayonets and guns of the Chiang Kai-shek military clique." In the civil war, they could not only directly loot the people in the war zones but also extort "military expenses" from the people across the country, as well as "borrow" domestic and foreign debts to fill their own pockets. No matter whether they won or lost, they always made money. Therefore, "someone once calculated that the Northern Warlords had a total of eleven civil wars from the founding of the Republic to the seventeenth year, averaging less than one war per year, totaling eight hundred and eighty-five days," while "the Chiang family court, from the establishment of the government in Nanjing until the Xi'an Incident, fought against the people and against all dissidents for ten years without interruption for a single day." Although they were full of "peace" and "political solutions," as long as this blood-drinking rule of theirs exists for one day, they will not stop slaughtering the people and currying favor with foreign countries. This time, aren't they going to earn hundreds of millions of American dollars from the anti-communist civil war they are waging? Unless his capital (living strength) is eliminated militarily, he will not stop drinking blood automatically.

	The third gain is to clearly see that Chiang Kai-shek and the four big families have already walked to the edge of the grave, which has strengthened my confidence in the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. Comrade Chen Boda tells us in this book: "The nineteen years of rule by the four big families have given China the greatest shame and disaster." Precisely because they "have said all the good words and done all the bad deeds," harming the interests of all classes, "the people can no longer live as before," "peasants, workers, petty bourgeoisie, national liberal bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and all men and women with justice and vigor" are all united on the patriotic and democratic front to "rise up and fight to the death." "No matter what foreign reactionaries support the four big families, they will ultimately have no way to resist the impact of the Chinese people's great youthful force to turn the world upside down. The victory of the people is certain and inevitable." This is not a passionate desire but a solemn prediction obtained after conducting a thorough scientific study of it.

	Comrade Chen Boda is one of the foremost experts in modern Chinese history. In this book, he collected all the important materials he could access and truly achieved "not a single word without a source." Under the guidance of the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, he conducted precise scientific research on this special comprador bureaucratic capital of China and its political form. Therefore, not only the content of the book itself but also his research and writing methods enlightened us on the method of how Chairman Mao viewed things and thought about problems.

	I think that not only will I put down the burden of peaceful illusions and strengthen my confidence in victory after reading this book; even the national capitalists in the Chiang-occupied areas, and even some blind people who are utilized and run errands for the four big families, will surely suddenly realize after reading this book: "For nineteen years, the four big families have monopolized finance, commerce, industry, agriculture, real estate, news, publishing, etc. in the form of 'official' and 'commercial'," "turning public into private," stealing the country as their private property; and "abusing public power for private gain," using the names of "country" and "government" to "ruthlessly plunder the people." This is making enemies with every Chinese person, and in the end, they will inevitably scrape clean everything the people have and dedicate it to American imperialism. To survive, we must work with the people to eliminate this "shame and disaster."

### 读了《中国四大家族》以后

　　读了《中国四大家族》以后
    土
    花了七天的时间，把《中国四大家族》连读了两遍，固然还是有些走马看花，但在思想上却获益不少。
    第一个收获是更清楚而明确地了解了蒋介石法西斯统治的本质。这是一小群买办的、封建的、军事的金融寡头，要依靠独裁专制政治来掠取财富。四大家族的主人，“直接集中国民党政权的军务、党务、特务、政务、财务的大权，形成了以国民党一党专政为政治形式的封建买办的法西斯寡头独裁制度”。在金融上他们分掌着中（央）、中（国）、交（通）、农（民）四大“国家银行”，作为主要吸血管，利用专制政治权力，滥发“法币”以夺取人民的物资。在商业上利用“贸易委员会”“专卖局”等法西斯行政机构，实行“有史以来最集中的公开商业独占”和买贱卖贵的野蛮掠夺。在工业上施行垄断管制，绞杀民族工业，为美国货当总买办，把中国变成“美国的工业边界”。在农业上掠夺集中土地，设立“中央合作金库”“农本局”等，用征实、征购和农贷的办法，吸尽农民每一滴血汗，促成农业经济整个崩溃。在文化上垄断压制，在生活上比历代帝王更奢华。总之，作者给蒋家朝廷这恶毒而又腐朽的吸血机构，画出了一付清淅无比的解剖图，写出了简明扼要的生长史，使我对这种统治的性质，再没有任何错觉。从前，特别是在合作抗战及政治协商的时候，我还曾考虑过蒋介石等统治者有没有革命性的问题。读了这本书，像用显微镜检查了一次粪便，除下腐臭与反动毒菌外，再也看不到别的。
    第二个收获是明确的知道蒋介石及其“领导”下的四大家族，全靠“一双血腥的手起家”，而又以进行反人民内战为卖国发财的主要手段，真正使我卸下了和平幻想的包袱。四大家族十九年来之所以“飞黄腾达”，是“蒋介石军事集团的刺刀和枪杆打出来的”。在内战中不仅可以直接抢劫战区人民，而且可以向全国人民索取“军费”，以及“借”内外债以饱入私囊，不管打胜打败，反正都有钱赚。所以“曾经有人计算过：北洋军阀从民元到民十七年共有十一次内战，平均一年不到一次，时间总计为八百八十五日”，而“蒋家朝廷自从南京开府，直到西安事变为止，对人民作战，对一切异己作战，首尾十年，简直没有间断过一天”。尽管他们满口“和平”，“政治解决”，只要他们这种喝血统治存在一天，他们就不会不屠杀人民，取媚外国。这次他们进行的反共大内战，不又有几十万万美金好赚么？非在军事上搞掉他的老本（有生力量），他是不会自动停止喝血的。
    第三个收获是，清清楚楚看到蒋介石等四大家族，已经走进坟墓的边缘，加强了我对爱国自卫战争的胜利信心。陈伯达同志在这本书里告诉了我们：“四大家族十九年的统治，给了中国最大的耻辱与灾难”。正因为他们“好话说尽，坏事做尽”，损害了一切阶层的利益，使得“人民已不能够照旧生活下去”，“农民、工人、小资产阶级、民族自由资产阶级、知识分子、以及一切有正义有血气的男和女”，都一致集合在爱国民主阵线上“起而作殊死的斗争”，“不管有什么外国反动派给四大家族撑腰，然而终归没有法子可以抗拒中国人民伟大的青春的旋干转坤的力量的冲击。人民的胜利是一定的，无可避免的。”这不是热情的想望，而是对它作过通前彻后的科学研究后，所得到的庄严的预告。
    陈伯达同志是数一数二的中国近代史专家，在这本书里他收集了凡能接触到的一切重要材料，真正作到了“没有一句话没有来历”。在毛主席思想的光辉指引下，他对中国这一特殊的买办官僚资本和他的政治形态，作了精密的科学的研究。因此不仅书的内容本身，就是他研究和叙写的方法，也把毛主席看事物想问题的方法启示了我们。
    我想不仅我看了这本书后放下和平幻想的包袱，加强胜利的信心；就是蒋占区的民族资本家，甚至一些盲目的为四大家族所利用奔走的人，看了这本书以后，也一定恍然大悟：“十九年来四大家族用‘官’、‘商’形式独占金融、商业、工业、农业、地产、新闻、出版事业等等”，“化公为私”，盗窃国家为他们的私产；和“假公济私”以“国家”“政府”等名义，“无情的掠夺人民”，这是和每一个中国人为敌，最后必然要把人民所有一概刮尽，奉献给美国帝国主义。要想活下去，一定得和人民一起来为消灭这种“耻辱和灾难”而努力。
