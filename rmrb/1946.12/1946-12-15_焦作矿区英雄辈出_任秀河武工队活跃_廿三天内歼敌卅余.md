    【This newspaper, Changzhi, 11th dispatch】In the "Carry out the Yang Juhe Movement," another banner of people's guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines has emerged in the Jiaozuo mining area - the Ren Xiuhe Armed Work Team. Ren Xiuhe is a young cadre of twenty-one years old. On the 8th of last month, he went to work in the first district of Jiaozuo from the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district Military Committee. The armed work team he led killed or wounded more than 30 enemy soldiers in Jiaozuo in 23 days. The burning of the four major artillery towers of the enemy in Jiaozuo on the nights of the 13th and 14th of last month was the masterpiece of this team. On the 18th, in the battle of Maocha Village against eight times the enemy, they defeated the enemy completely in ten minutes and killed 13 enemies, which was also the Ren Xiuhe Armed Work Team. Therefore, the masses around the Jiaozuo mining area call Ren Xiuhe "Yang Juhe the Second." This heroic team is supported and loved by the masses everywhere. On the 23rd of last month, the team took the initiative to cooperate with a unit of the Eighth Route Army to attack the enemy's stronghold in Jiaokou. The task of the Ren Xiuhe Armed Work Team was to occupy the mountain outside Jiaokou Village. Although more than 20 enemies entrenched on the mountain were suppressing them with fierce firepower from a high position, Ren Xiuhe and his ×× team members finally successfully completed the task of occupying the mountain. After arranging the defense, he immediately led several team members to rush into the village to capture the enemy. The enemy blocked the gate with huge stones on the high wall. After Ren Xiuhe carefully examined the terrain, he jumped onto the roof. The enemy who resisted stubbornly in the courtyard hurriedly retreated into the house. Just as he was about to pull the firing pin of the grenade, he heard Ren Xiuhe shout, "Don't move, whoever moves dies first!" and fired two shots upward. The four enemies quickly knelt down and begged for mercy. When the team members entered the courtyard, Ren Xiuhe ran into another courtyard. An enemy was trying to resist stubbornly with a short gun. Ren Xiuhe took advantage of his unpreparedness and jumped forward to grab the enemy's neck, turning the enemy's weapon into his own, and escorted the prisoner out. The Ren Xiuhe-style armed work team members are all as brave as tigers, guarding the mountain on one side and cooperating with the main force to clear out the enemies in the Jiaokou stronghold on the other.

    焦作矿区英雄辈出
    任秀河武工队活跃
    廿三天内歼敌卅余
    【本报长治十一日电】焦作矿区在“开展杨聚和运动”声中，又涌现了一支敌后人民游击战争的旗帜——任秀河武工队。任秀河是一位二十一岁的青年干部，上月八日自太行四分区武委会至焦作一区工作，他所带领的一支武工队，二十三天内毙伤焦作敌军三十余名。上月十三十四两夜，焦作敌四大炮楼连遭焚毁，即为该队杰作。十八日，毛岔村与八倍之敌作战，又于十分钟内将敌全部击溃，并毙敌十三名者，亦即是任秀河的武工队。因此焦作矿区周围群众，都把任秀河叫作“杨聚和第二”。这支英雄的队伍，到处受着群众的拥护与爱戴。上月二十三日，该队更主动配合八路军一部，袭击交口据点之敌，任秀河武工队的任务是占领交口村外的山头，虽然盘踞山头二十多个敌人，以猛烈的火力居高临下压迫着他们，可是任秀河和他××个队员，终于胜利完成占领山头的任务。他布置好防务后，旋即带领几个队员飞奔进村去捉拿敌人，敌凭高墙以巨石封锁大门，任秀河详察地形后，纵身跳上房顶，在院中顽抗之敌，慌忙退入屋内，正待要拉手榴弹的拉火线，只听得任秀河大喊一声：“不准动，谁动谁先死！”并顺手向上打了两枪，四个敌人连忙跪下求饶。等队员进院时，任秀河又跑进另一个院内，一个敌人正持短枪企图顽抗，任秀河乘其不防，纵身上前卡住敌人的脖子，把敌人的武器变成自己的武器，押送着俘虏出来。任秀河型的武工队员们，也都是个个猛勇如虎，一面把守着山头，一面协同主力肃清交口据点的敌人。
