Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. TASS reports: The Soviet government's official newspaper, Izvestia, published an article on the 9th, pointing out that the key to the current China problem lies in implementing the resolutions of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, stopping the civil war, legalizing truly democratic forces, eliminating foreign influence that fuels the civil war, and emphasizing that "if the Kuomintang leadership group cannot change its current actions, then almost nothing will happen except that its political crisis will further develop and intensify." The article rebukes American reactionaries for "trying to turn China into their semi-colony and a strategic bridgehead in the Far East." It also points out that the Sino-US Commercial Treaty signed by Chiang Kai-shek "is selling China to American monopolistic capitalists."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. According to the Tianjin Yishibao of the 1st of this month, a special dispatch from New York stated: A booklet has been circulating within the United Nations General Assembly recently, published by the "Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy," containing news from Beiping by American journalist Anna Louise Strong on November 4th. She said: Although the Kuomintang army has captured many areas from the Communist army, this does not mean that the government can retain them for long. She also said that the Communist areas are better governed and have freedom of election. She also conveyed the opinions of the Chinese Communists to the United Nations, accusing the United States of supporting the Kuomintang government in undermining peace, demanding the cessation of lend-lease supplies, the withdrawal of American troops, and warning the delegates to the United Nations General Assembly not to be deceived by Chiang Kai-shek and his delegation.

　　苏联消息报著文指出
    解决中国问题的关键在于实行莫斯科决议
    【新华社延安十五日电】据塔斯社讯：苏联政府机关报消息报九日发表一文，指出目前中国问题的关键，在于实行莫斯科三外长会议的决议，停止内战，使真正民主力量合法化，取消助长内战的外国影响，并强调指出“假如国民党领导集团不能改变现在的举措的话，那么除了其政治危机将进一步发展与加剧之外，几乎不会有什么别的事情发生。”该文斥责美反动派“图将中国变为他的半殖民地，和远东战略上的桥头堡垒”。并指出蒋介石签订的中美商约，“是将中国出卖给美国独占资本家。”
    【新华社延安十五日电】据本月一日天津益世报载纽约专电称：联合国大会内最近流传着一种小册子，为“民主远东政策委员会”所印发，里面有美国女记者斯特朗十一月四日从北平所发的消息，她说：国民党军虽然自共军手中攻占许多地区，但这并不表示政府就能长期保留。又说：中共区治理较好，选举也有自由。她并将中共意见转给联合国，责备美国支持国民党政府破坏和平，要求停止租借物资，撤退美国驻军，警告联合国大会代表不要受蒋介石和他的代表团的欺骗。
