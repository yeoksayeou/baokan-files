　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 2nd: According to various reports, as a result of the Chiang government arresting three thousand small vendors and massacring petitioning vendor masses, the angry resistance of the vendor masses yesterday has taken the form of a city-wide riot in Shanghai. Reports from Reuters and the Associated Press both describe "this riot as the most serious since the May 30th Massacre in 1925." More than 5,000 larger vendors appeared in all the streets of Shanghai yesterday, using stones, bamboo poles, and wooden sticks to confront fully armed police and troops, and continued to surround the Huangpu Police Bureau. With the exception of a very few small businesses, all stores in the city closed down, and public buses and streetcars were forced to stop running. All of Chiang Kai-shek's police, military police, and troops were mobilized, using water cannons, bayonets, batons, rifles, machine guns, and tear gas bombs to massacre the resisting masses. According to the Associated Press, in front of the Huangpu Police Bureau, "the police's show of force by dragging away and beating the masses in the afternoon only angered the masses. The police called in two fire engines, and four water cannons sprayed the rioters for more than an hour. Police reinforcements were continuously dispatched to the scene. When the masses, despite being in the bleak cold rain, still refused to retreat, the police threw tear gas bombs at the masses." According to Reuters, "Throughout the day, the military police fired at the masses at least a hundred times in volleys. The number of masses killed and injured in the army and police massacre is still impossible to count. The minimum is ten dead and over a hundred injured. The Kuomintang authorities are trying to cover up the truth of their massacre of the masses. A newspaper reporter was seriously injured by the police while interviewing for news; an American photography reporter saw two corpses and attempted to take pictures, but was stopped by police holding rifles with fixed bayonets. (Associated Press)" According to the latest news, the Shanghai urban area had become slightly quieter by late last night, but large numbers of people were still gathered near the police station in the bitter rain and freezing wind, and all of Shanghai was still under martial law.

　　摊贩群众愤抗军警屠杀
  　上海全市掀起大骚动
  　蒋家军警竟用催泪性炸弹屠杀人民
    【新华社延安二日电】据各方报导：由于蒋政府逮捕三千小摊贩，并屠杀摊贩请愿群众之结果，昨日摊贩群众的愤激反抗，已形成为全上海的骚动。路透社、合众社的报导均描写“这次骚动为一九二五年五卅惨案以来最严重的一次”，较大的五千余摊贩昨日竟日在全上海各街市出现，以石头竹杠木棒对付全副武装的警察及军队，并继续包围黄浦警察局。除极少数小商号外，全市商店均行停业，公共汽车电车均被迫停驶，蒋家所有警察宪兵军队全部出动，用水龙、刺刀、警棍、步枪、机枪及催泪性炸弹，屠杀反抗之群众。据合众社报导，在黄浦警察局前，“午后警察拖走与痛打群众这种逞威的行动，只是激怒了群众，警察调来两架救火机，四支水龙向骚动者喷射一小时以上，警察增援部队陆续派至出事地点，当群众虽在凄凉的寒雨之下，仍拒绝退却时，警察向群众抛掷催泪性炸弹”。据路透社称：“全日军警向群众开枪至少在一百排以上，在军队警察屠杀下死伤之群众，尚无法统计，最低限度死十人，伤百余人。国民党当局力图掩盖其屠杀群众的真象，某报记者采访消息时为警察所重伤；一位美国照像记者看到两具尸体，企图照象时，为手持上了刺刀的步枪的警察所阻住。（合众社）据最后消息，昨日深夜上海市区稍归沉静，但大批群众在苦雨与凛烈寒风中仍然齐集警察局附近，全上海仍然处于戒严状态。
