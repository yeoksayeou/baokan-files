Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 22nd: A Tokyo dispatch reports: On the morning of the 20th, 20,000 Koreans gathered in front of the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence to demonstrate and petition, demanding that the Yoshida government continue to provide free repatriation for Koreans. Several hundred Japanese police officers attempted to disperse the demonstrators, but were overwhelmed by the surging momentum of the Koreans. They then sought assistance from the American military police. The entire US Marine Corps military police force was dispatched, mounting machine guns on jeeps and charging into the demonstrating masses. However, the 20,000 Koreans persisted unyieldingly and did not retreat. The Japanese and American military police were helpless and allowed ten representatives of the Korean Democratic Security Guarantee Committee, which organized the demonstration, to meet with Yoshida and present their demands. Simultaneously with the demonstration at Yoshida's official residence, 50,000 Koreans held similar demonstrations in other areas of Tokyo.

　　东京七万韩人示威
    要求免费遣送返国
    虽有日美警宪联合镇压
    仍然坚持不懈毫不退缩
    【新华社延安二十二日电】东京讯：二十日上午，日首相官邸前聚集两万韩人示威请愿，要求吉田政府继续免费遣送韩人返国。数百名日警曾图驱散示威队伍，但为声势汹涌之韩人所压服。于是乃向美宪兵求援，美海军陆战队宪兵乃全体出动，在吉普车上架机枪向示威群众冲撞，但两万韩人坚持不懈，毫不退缩。日美宪警无奈，乃允许主持此次示威之朝鲜民主安全保障委员会之十位代表见吉田，提出要求。与吉田官邸示威同时，亦有五万韩人在东京其他地区举行同样示威。
