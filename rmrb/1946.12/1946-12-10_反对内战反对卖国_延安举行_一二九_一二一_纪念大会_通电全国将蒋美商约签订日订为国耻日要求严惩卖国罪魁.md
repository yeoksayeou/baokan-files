    Telegram to the Nation Designates the Day of Signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty as a National Humiliation Day, Demanding Severe Punishment for the Chief Culprits of National Betrayal
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th] More than 1,000 young people from all walks of life in Yan'an held a “December 9th” and “December 21st” Commemoration Rally at the auditorium of the Border Region Assembly yesterday (the 5th) at 4 p.m., unanimously passing a proposal to designate November 4th, the day the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was signed, as China's National Humiliation Day, and demanding severe punishment for the chief culprits who signed this traitorous treaty. At the meeting, Feng Wenbin, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Areas Youth Federation, delivered a speech (abstract of the speech in another telegram), followed by a speech by Lu Dingyi (abstract of the speech in another telegram). American friend Li Dunbai was invited to speak. He recalled the tragedy he witnessed in Kunming after “December 21st,” where Chiang Kai-shek's special agents used American-made grenades to injure a female nurse. He said angrily, "The American people will rise up to oppose this atrocity!" He called on the Chinese and American people to join hands and strive to oppose American imperialism. Li Furen, the youth leader of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, delivered a speech, calling on all young people in the Northwest to rise up to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship and civil war. Wang Chaocheng, who participated in the "December 9th" Movement, said in his speech: "If Chiang Kai-shek dares to attack Yan'an, he will definitely be crushed." The meeting ended with the singing of the "March of the Volunteers" and "We Oppose This."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] The full text of the telegram from the Yan'an Youth "December 9th" and "December 21st" Commemoration Rally is as follows:
    To all political parties, organizations, newspapers, schools, and patriotic people across the country:
    The Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, signed in Nanjing on November 4th by the National Government and the U.S. Government, is a treaty of national betrayal and humiliation that far exceeds the Twenty-One Demands. If it is implemented, our country will inevitably perish. We demand that the entire nation resolutely refuses to recognize this traitorous treaty, punishes the chief culprits responsible for signing the treaty, strives to completely abolish the treaty, and formulates a new treaty through consultation among all parties. Before the current treaty is abolished, we hereby propose to all sectors of society to designate November 4th as China's National Humiliation Memorial Day. We hope for unanimous support to promote its realization. Yan'an Youth “December 9th” and “December 21st” Commemoration Rally, December 5th.

    通电全国将蒋美商约签订日订为国耻日要求严惩卖国罪魁
    【新华社延安六日电】延安各界青年一千余人于昨日（五日）下午四时在边区参议会大礼堂举行“一二九”“一二一”纪念大会，一致通过将十一月四日蒋美商约签订日订为中国国耻日，及要求严惩签订此卖国条约的罪魁的提案。会上解放区青联筹委会主任冯文彬致词（演说摘要见另电），继由陆定一讲话（演说摘要见另电），美国友人李敦白被邀讲话，他追述“一二一”以后在昆明目睹蒋介石特务用美制手榴弹杀伤一女护士的惨状，他愤然的说：“美国人民会起来反对这种暴行的”！他号召中美人民携手并进为反对美帝国主义而奋斗。民盟西北总支部青年负责人李敷仁讲演，号召全西北青年起来反对蒋介石卖国独裁内战。曾参加“一二九”运动的王朝成在讲话中说：“蒋介石如果胆敢进攻延安，一定遭受到粉碎”。大会于“义勇军进行曲”及“我们反对这个”的歌声中散会。
    【新华社延安七日电】延安各界青年“一二九”“一二一”纪念大会通电原文如下：
    全国各党派、各团体、各报馆、各学校、各爱国人士公鉴！
    十一月四日，国民政府与美国政府在南京签订的中美友好通商航海条约，丧权辱国，远过二十一条，如任其实施，则我国非至亡国灭种不止。我们要求全国上下坚决不承认这个卖国条约，惩办负责订约的卖国罪魁，力争全部废除该约，并由各党派协商另订新约。在现约未废前，我们谨向全国各界提议规定十一月四日为我国国耻纪念日，尚希一致主张，促其实现。延安各界青年“一二九”“一二一”纪念大会十二月五日。
