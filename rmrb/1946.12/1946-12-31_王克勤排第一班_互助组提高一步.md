　　Wang Keqin's Platoon Takes the Lead: Mutual Aid Group Takes a Step Forward
　　[This newspaper's dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, 29th] The mutual aid group of Wang Keqin's platoon achieved great results in the Hua County battle. They summarized the mutual aid group and took it a step forward. During the rest period after the great victory of Hua (County) and Pu (County), the first task was to march, followed by fighting. Many new soldiers had been added to the platoon. In order to complete this marching and combat mission, the new soldiers fought bravely, but felt they lacked skills. To dispel their concerns, the veteran soldiers proposed mutual aid, and introduced the past experience that mutual aid in combat could eliminate more enemies. They also clearly put forward the slogan "Rely on parents at home, rely on mutual aid when out for revolution." The platoon, based on its own tasks and situation, proposed to transform the mutual aid group. Platoon leader Zhang Taiping first proposed the conditions for the group leader: (1) Have military skills and combat experience, and be able to lead everyone in combat. (2) Be physically strong and able to help carry things during the march. Based on these two conditions, everyone elected the group leader and deputy group leader. After the new mutual aid group was established, they discussed their respective group's work. Group leader Chen Fenghuan of the first group said: "I will first set an example, and guarantee that our group will not fall behind during this march. Our group will compete with the second and third groups!" The second and third groups immediately responded to the challenge. On the third day of the march, they walked one hundred li overnight and were about to fight. When they started walking, Comrade Chen Fenghuan's stomach hurt badly, but he thought to himself, I proposed that our group not fall behind and compete with the second and third groups. It would be nothing if others fell behind, but I am the group leader… When the stomach pain came, I was really anxious, but he persisted overnight without falling behind, and carried his own things and rifle. When others wanted to carry things for him, he resolutely refused. After reorganizing the mutual aid group, everyone had specific divisions of labor. Before each march, the first group delivered things, the second group cleaned up, and the third group inspected the quality. When arriving at the campsite, the first group boiled water, the second group repaired the houses, and the third group looked for doors and mats, etc. With everyone dividing the work and getting started, everyone could drink water and wash their feet within an hour. Work that previously took more than two hours to do, everyone can now do quickly, and can also rest well. The platoon leader also saves a lot of trouble.

　　王克勤排第一班
    互助组提高一步
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】王克勤排第一班的互助组，在滑县战斗中收到很大的效果，他们把互助组作了总结并提高了一步。滑（县）濮（县）大捷后的休整时期，首先要行军，接着又要打仗，班里新战士又增加了不少，为了完成这次行军和战斗任务，新战士都勇敢打仗，但觉得没有技术，为了解除他们这个顾虑，老战士就提出要互助，并介绍过去在战斗中互助可多消灭敌人的经验。并明确提出了“在家靠父母，出来革命靠互助”的口号。该班根据自己的任务和情况，提出改造互助组。班长张太平首先提出组长的条件：（一）有军事技术和战斗经验，能带领大家作战。（二）身体强壮，在行军中能帮助背东西。根据这两个条件，大家选了正副组长。新互助组成立后，他们分别讨论本组的工作。一组组长陈风焕说：“我自己先作模范，这次行军保证不掉队，俺组向二三组比赛！”二三组马上应战，在行军的第三天，一夜走了一百里，马上就要打仗。开始走时，陈风焕同志的肚子痛得很，但他自己想，我提出本组不掉队和二三组比赛，要是别人倒没啥，我又是组长………肚子痛起来真着急，但他坚持了一夜没有掉队，还背着自己的东西和步枪，别人要替他背东西，他坚决不让。重新组织互助组后，大家具体分工，每次行军前，一组送东西，二组打扫卫生，三组进行检查好坏。到宿营地时一组烧水，二组修理房子，三组找门板和席子等，大家分工动手，在一小时内大家都喝好了水，洗好了脚，从前两小时多做不了的工作，现在大家能很快做好，又能好好休息，班长也省很多事情。
