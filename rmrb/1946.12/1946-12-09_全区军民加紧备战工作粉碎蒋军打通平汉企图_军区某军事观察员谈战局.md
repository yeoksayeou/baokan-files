　　The Whole Region's Military and Civilians Intensify War Preparations to Crush Chiang Kai-shek's Army's Attempt to Open the Pinghan Railway
  　A Military Observer from the Military Region Discusses the War Situation
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 7th Dispatch] After the two great victories in Juancheng and Puyang, our army victoriously recovered Juancheng and Yuncheng. Chiang Kai-shek, in a flurry, concentrated all Chiang's troops in northern Henan at the end of last month, including the 85th Division, the 32nd Division, the 5th Army, and the 6th Brigade of the 75th Division, to continue to invade and occupy Puyang County; On the northern front, in the Shijiazhuang area, Chiang's army also transferred four regiments of the 53rd Army from the northeast, combining with the 32nd Division of the 3rd Army of Chiang's army entrenched in Shijiazhuang, totaling seven regiments, also showing signs of advancing south. A military observer from the military region stated: Chiang's army's current action is a continuation of the plan to open the Pinghan line last month after it was crushed, with the intention of first concentrating all its forces in northern Henan (six brigades) to attack Daming to the north, and then, together with the 40th Division and part of the 32nd Division in Anyang, continuing eastward after invading Chuwang and Huilong to meet in Daming; then cooperate with the southward troops in Shijiazhuang to meet in Xingtai and Handan, and further open the Pinghan line. Chiang Kai-shek's wishful thinking, like the previous few times, is extremely dangerous, because Chiang's army, with insufficient troops, will leave its rear extremely empty when it concentrates its forces to advance north. At present, due to the extremely large concentration of Chiang's army in the vast areas of northern Henan, the Daoging line between Tangyin and Xinxiang and its entire transverse area in northern Henan are guarded mostly by puppet troops and local security teams, except for a very small number of Chiang's regular troops. Therefore, Chiang's army's rear towns and railways are in danger of being recovered and cut off by our army at any time, and the recovery of Wen County in northern Henan is the most obvious proof. The observer continued: Regarding Chiang's army's rash advance in northern Henan, as long as the people in our region urgently mobilize, earnestly prepare for war, and leave nothing for Chiang's army, not even a grain of food, and widely carry out guerrilla warfare in the areas occupied by Chiang's army, constantly containing, consuming, and attacking the enemy, creating opportunities for the main force to annihilate the enemy, and giving the invading Chiang's army one or two new blows, then Chiang Kai-shek's risky plan will not be difficult to be crushed. The observer finally pointed out: Chiang's army's deep penetration into our area for combat, the lengthening of the transportation lines, and the increasing difficulty of supply, our army can completely achieve the goal of preventing the enemy from escaping when annihilating the enemy's main force, and truly realize Chairman Mao's instruction: "Completely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate them."

　　全区军民加紧备战工作粉碎蒋军打通平汉企图
  　军区某军事观察员谈战局
    【本报邯郸七日电】鄄城、濮阳两次大捷后，我军胜利的收复了鄄城、郓城。手忙脚乱的蒋介石，乃于上月底集中豫北所有蒋军，八十五师、三十二师、第五军以及七十五师六旅之众，继续侵占我濮阳县城；北线石家庄地区蒋军亦从东北调来五十三军四个团，结合盘踞石家庄蒋军第三军之三十二师共七个团兵力，亦有向南进犯模样。军区军事观察员称：蒋军此次行动，乃上月打通平汉计划被粉碎后再次的继续，其企图是首先在豫北集中所有兵力（六个旅）北犯大名，再与安阳之四十师及三十二师一部于侵占楚旺、回隆之后，继续东进，会师大名；然后配合石家庄南下部队，会师邢台、邯郸，并进一步打通平汉线。蒋介石此一如意算盘，与过去数次一样，是极其危险的，因为兵力不足之蒋军，当其集中兵力北进后，其后方地区则极为空虚。目前豫北广大地区由于蒋军极大量集中，致汤阴新乡间道清沿线及其整个豫北横贯地带，除极少数蒋军正规部队外，大部守卫部队均为伪军地方保安队。因此蒋军后方城镇以及铁道，随时有为我军收复与切断之虞，豫北温县之收复，就是最明显的证明。该观察员继称：对豫北此次冒进之蒋军，只要我区人民紧急动员起来，切实进行备战，不给蒋军留下一点东西，一颗粮食，在蒋军侵占地区广泛开展游击战争，到处牵制、消耗、打击敌人，给主力军创造机动歼敌的机会，再给进犯蒋军以新的一两个打击，那么蒋介石此一冒险计划，是不难被粉碎的。该观察员最后指出：蒋军深入我区作战，交通线拉长，补给更形困难，我军在歼灭敌之主力时，完全可以作到使敌一个逃跑不脱，真正可以实现毛主席的指示：“全部的、彻底的、干净的消灭之”。
