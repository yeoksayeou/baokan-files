    Han Liuha Actively Practices Martial Arts, Without Interrupting Production
    [This Dispatch] The Han Liuha family in Henan Village, Licheng, practices martial arts and does not interrupt production. Han Liuha is already 51 years old. Since attending the Taihang District Model Workers Congress, his enthusiasm for martial arts has increased, and he has not given up practicing martial arts under any busy circumstances. When transporting military grain, he mobilized people to bring thirteen hand grenades and competed in throwing them during breaks. In order to improve the village's self-study of martial arts, he convened a family meeting and specifically divided the work. Old Han led the militia to practice martial arts, Cui Feng led the women in the textile group to spare time for grenade throwing, and Hu'er led the children at school to throw grenades. Cui Feng (16 years old) can now throw 30 meters, and Hu'er (15 years old) can throw 20 meters. Old Han also took three apprentices to dig a mine pit in the yard to teach them how to plant mines. When he heard that Chiang Kai-shek was going to attack the liberated areas, he studied mine laying. During this year's autumn harvest, he created a kind of upward-triggering mine, and the whole family dug seven stone mines. The old model worker is a skilled grenade thrower and mine layer, and has also learned to make detonators.
    [This Dispatch] The militia in the third district of Pingshun have great enthusiasm for self-study. In the past six months, they have conducted "live shooting" exercises in the field with homemade guns, killing more than 4,000 raccoon dogs, fourteen foxes and badgers, and five wolves. According to the villagers' militia: "We will work harder to practice martial arts in the future to deal with the invading army that harms the people."
    [Another Dispatch] Yao Loushuan, the militia instructor in Shangjiao Zhang, Zuoquan, intensified his martial arts practice and shot nine raccoon dogs with nine shots. In the past, his shooting was very poor. He was determined to seize the gaps in production to practice hard. He started by aiming at a triangle with a rifle, and later used a homemade gun to shoot at living creatures in the wild. Under the influence of Yao Loushuan, the entire village militia launched a self-study movement.

    韩六孩热心练武
    生产中也不间断
    【本报讯】黎城河南村韩六孩一家练武，生产中亦不间断。韩六孩已五十一岁，他自出席太行区群英大会后，练武劲头更大，在任何繁忙的生活下他也不放弃练武。在义运军粮时，他动员人带了十三颗手掷弹，在休息时比赛投弹。他为了把全村练武自学都搞好，召开了家庭会议，具体分了工，老韩领导民兵练武，翠凤在纺织组领导妇女抽空投弹，虎儿在学校带领儿童投，翠凤（十六岁）现能投三十米，虎儿（十五岁）能投二十米，老韩还带了三个徒弟在院里打下埋雷坑，教他们学埋雷。他听到蒋介石要进攻解放区，他就钻研埋雷。在今年秋收中创造出一种上绞雷，全家凿了七个石雷，老模范是投弹埋雷能手，并学会了造爆发管。
    【本报讯】平顺三区民兵自学劲头很大，半年来以土枪在野外作“打生”演习，共打死貉＠四千余个，狐子及獾十四个，狼五只。据各村民兵反映：“今后更努力练武，来对付遭害人民的进犯军。”
    【又讯】左权上交漳民兵指导员姚楼拴，加紧练武，九枪打住九个貉＠。过去他的枪打的很不好，自己下决心在生产中抓紧空隙苦练，开始用步枪瞄三角，后来在野外用土枪打生物。在姚楼拴影响下，全村民兵都展开了自学运动。
