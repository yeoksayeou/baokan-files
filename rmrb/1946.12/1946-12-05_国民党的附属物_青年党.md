"Appendage of the Kuomintang" – The Youth Party

　　Ignoring domestic and international public opinion, the Youth Party willingly acts as an "appendage of the Kuomintang" and participates in the illegal "National Assembly." This is not surprising given the Youth Party's history and political platform.

　　The Youth Party was called the "Nationalist Youth Corps" in 1925. It was formed by the union of several small nationalist groups (such as the National Soul Society in Beijing and the National Glory Society in Jiangsu). At that time, they claimed to "eliminate domestic traitors and resist foreign powers," but in reality, they relied on imperialists and warlords. They received subsidies under the protection of Sun Chuanfang and others, and founded the "Awakened Lion" weekly to oppose the vigorous First Chinese Revolution. In July 1926, the party's first national congress issued a statement on the current situation, opposing the Northern Expedition and the revolutionary movement under the guise of "opposing unification by force and one-party control of state affairs." During the civil war, they acted as an echo of the Kuomintang, openly advocating anti-communism and anti-people policies. In the early days of the War of Resistance against Japan, they sabotaged the war by saying that resistance was "should be fought, but cannot be fought." The New China Daily (the Youth Party's newspaper) stated in September 1940: "Being able to fight does not necessarily mean it should be fought, and if it should be fought, it does not necessarily mean it can be fought. Therefore, I only say it should be fought, but I do not say whether it can be fought."

　　In August of the same year, the newspaper praised the French traitorous Vichy government, saying that Pétain was "bearing the burden of humiliation" and "if he dies a martyr one day, who will know his loyalty and treachery?" They used this "example" to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to surrender to Japanese imperialism. Their "leader," Zeng Qi, lived in Shanghai for a long time at that time and was in close contact with Japanese traitors, hoping to obtain an official position in the puppet organization. He said in a poem with the traitor Liang Hongzhi: "A new year brings new hopes, and the world is clear of dust. Seven years of illness accumulated, three years of moxa. One tree blooms, and ten thousand trees spring. Fishing is hard to start Wei, and will pray for harmony to listen to the people. The legacy of lecturing in He Fen is still there, and we will see Zhenguan restore order." He compared the traitor to King Wen of Zhou and Emperor Taizong of Tang, and himself to Jiang Ziya and a hermit, hoping that the traitor would reuse him, and praised the traitor's rule as "a new year," "a clear time," which made his "eyes and ears refreshed," praising the Japanese invaders and Liang as rare wise monarchs and sages.

　　After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Youth Party threw away the democratic disguise that it had once adorned itself with during the war and openly supported dictatorship and surrender to the United States. They advocated: "The supreme decision-making power of the leader has both relative and absolute meanings. The so-called absolute meaning is that no matter what the supreme decision-making power is, as long as it is indeed the leader's decision, it must be followed without question." (National Opinion No. 12) In January of this year, the Youth Party received 100 million yuan in subsidies from the Kuomintang to help the Kuomintang in the Political Consultative Conference, shouting "nationalization of the army" and demanding that the CCP hand over all its armed forces. They believed that the Kuomintang government's recognition of the Communist Party having twelve divisions would "lose the dignity and decorum of the government." After the Political Consultative Conference, they received another 50 million yuan in subsidies from Chiang Kai-shek to run newspapers everywhere to promote the Kuomintang. For example, the "China Times" in Shanghai is an echo of the Chiang family government. In June, when the Kuomintang did not allow the New China Daily in Shanghai and Nanjing to be published, they also applauded and cheered, saying that it was appropriate for the authorities to ban the distribution of "exhortations" in the capital. In mid-August, just as the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale attack on the liberated areas, Zeng Qi and Liu Dongyan went to Lushan to pay homage to Chiang Kai-shek, hoping to use their participation in the puppet National Assembly as political capital to ask him for an important ministerial post. Who knew that Chiang Kai-shek's methods were very vicious. Not only did he not agree to Zeng Qi's request, but he also created a "New Central Committee of the Youth Party" headed by Chiang's special agent Zhou Jidao to coerce Zeng Qi and others. On August 21, Zhou Jidao told reporters in Nanjing: "Zeng Qi said that I was an enemy, then he is the head of the enemy."

　　After Japan's surrender, the American imperialists replaced Japan's past position in China, and they also changed from flattering Japan to flattering the United States. Zeng Qi said in an article not long ago: "The United States' friendship with China does not ask for any price, and our people believe it without doubt (!) and are sincerely grateful (!). Our country is willing to adopt an open-door policy based on the principles of reciprocity, mutual understanding, and mutual assistance (?) to exchange for the trust of the allied countries." Chang Yansheng, one of the "leaders" of the Youth Party, even slavishly "created" the "Jeep Girl" "appeasement" policy, advocating using the beauty of Chinese women to encourage the "fighting spirit" of the American army, shamelessly saying: "If China has three million allied soldiers in the future, one allied soldier will be paired with one Jeep Girl, and each Jeep Girl will produce a mixed-race child for China. Twenty years later, China will not only add three million men and women, all of whom will have the most excellent physique and intelligence. Is this benefit great or not?" (See Chang Yansheng's "Salute to the Jeep Girl" in New China Daily, June 4, 1945).

　　Such a politically completely rotten small group, today as a follower of the Kuomintang participating in the illegal "National Assembly," tomorrow as a burial object of the dictatorial and traitorous rule, suffering the same destruction as the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, is it not a matter of course?

　　“国民党的附属物”——青年党
    青年党不顾中外舆论的反对，甘当“国民党附属物”，参加非法的“国大，这从青年党的历史和政治主张看来是毫不足奇的。
    青年党在民国十四年叫“国家主义青年团”，是若干国家主义小团体（如北京的国魂社，江苏的国光社等）联合起来成立的。他们当时标榜“内除国贼外抗强权”，实际上则依附帝国主义与军阀，他们当时曾在孙传芳等卵翼之下，领了一些津贴，创办“醒狮”周报，反对轰轰烈烈的中国第一次大革命。十五年七月该党第一次全国代表大会发表对时局的主张，在“反对武力统一与一党包办国事”的口号掩盖下，反对北伐与革命运动。内战时期，他们作国民党的应声虫，公开的主张反共反人民。抗战初期，他们说抗战是“应该打，但不能打”来破坏抗战。二十九年九月新中国日报（青年党机关报称：“能打不一定应该打，而应该打不一定能打”，所以我只说应该打，并不说能不能打。”
    同年八月，该报歌颂法奸维希政府，说贝当是“忍辱负重”“假使一朝身先死，一身忠伪有谁知？”拿这个“榜样”去劝蒋介石对日本帝国主义投降。他们的“领袖”曾琦当时长期住在上海，和日本汉奸往返甚密，想在伪组织里，取得一官半职，曾在和梁逆鸿志的诗中说：“易岁心期耳目新，时清无复海扬尘，七年病蓄三年艾，一树花开万树春。垂钓漫劳求起渭，将与祈合听于民。河汾讲学遗风在，会见贞观拨乱人。”把汉奸比做周文王和唐太宗，把自己比做姜子牙和隐者，希望汉奸来重用他，并且歌颂汉奸的统治是“易岁”是“时清”使得他的“耳目一新”，赞扬日寇和梁逆是难得的贤君圣主。
    抗战胜利以后，青年党抛去了抗战时期曾一度装饰过自己的民主外衣，而赤裸裸地拥护独裁与投降美国。他们主张：“领袖之最高裁决权，其存在之理由有相对绝对两义。所谓绝对之义，即不问最高裁决权如何，只须其确为领袖之裁决即不问理由而必然奉行之”。（国论十二号）今年一月青年党领了国民党一万万元的津贴，替国民党在政协会上帮腔，高喊“军队国家化”，要中共交出全部武装，对国民党政府承认共产党有十二个师，认为“失去政府的尊严和体统”。政协会后又领了蒋介石的五万万元津贴，到各处办报为国民党宣传，如上海的“中国时报”就是蒋家政府的应声虫。六月间国民党不许上海南京的新华日报出版，他们也从旁鼓掌喝采，说什么当局禁止在首都要埠散发“檄文”是应当的。八月中旬，正当国民党反动派大举进攻解放区的时候，曾琦和刘东岩到庐山去朝拜蒋介石，希望用参加伪国大为政治资本，向他要一个重的部长来当，谁知蒋介石的手段，是很毒辣的，不但没有答应曾琦的要求，反而制造了一个以蒋特周济道为首的“青年党新中央”，以胁制曾琦等。八月二十一日，周济道在南京招待记者说：“曾琦说我曾附逆，那么他就是附逆头子”。
    日本投降以后，美帝国主义者代替了日本过去在华的地位，他们也由媚日转到媚美。曾琦在不久以前的一篇文章里说：“美国对华的友谊，不索取任何的代价，我国人信之不疑（！）且衷心铭感（？）吾国愿意本互惠互谅互助（？）之原则，采取门户开放政策，换取盟邦共信”。青年党“领袖”之一的常燕生，更奴颜婢膝的“创造”出“吉普女郎”“和亲”政策，提倡拿中国妇女的色相去鼓励美军的“斗志”，竟无耻的说：“假如中国将来有三百万盟军，一个盟军配以一个吉普女郎，每一个吉普女郎替中国生产一混血儿，二十年后，中国不但平添了三百万的丁男丁女，都是体格及智力最优秀的，这个利益大不大？”（见新中国日报三十四年六月四日常燕生作“向吉普女郎致敬”。）
    这样的一个政治上完全腐烂的小集团，今天作为国民党的追随者参加非法“国大”，明天作为独裁卖国统治的陪葬物，和蒋介石反动集团同遭覆灭，岂非理所当然么？（本报资料室）
