"I came back following Chairman Mao's route"
General Wang Zhen told a story at a welcoming meeting:

During a battle near Shanyang, a soldier who was usually very brave got separated from the group. Surrounded by Chiang Kai-shek's pursuing troops, he had to travel by night and hide during the day. He hid in the homes of ordinary people during the day, and walked dozens of miles every night. Although his feet were worn out after two months, he still carried his gun and bullets back to the border area.

Some comrades asked him, "You had no money and were unfamiliar with the roads. How could you come back alone?"

He said, "I came back following Chairman Mao's route." Some comrades didn't understand what he meant. He widened his eyes and said, "Don't you understand? Chairman Mao's route is the mass line! I came back by following the route Chairman Mao laid out!"

    “我是走毛主席路线回来的”
    王震将军在一个欢迎会上给大家讲了个故事：
    在山阳附近的战斗中，有一个平时很勇敢的战士掉了队，而四面又是蒋军追击部队，他只得昼伏夜走。白天老百姓家中隐蔽，每晚走几十里，走了两个月，虽走坏了脚，却仍背着枪和子弹回到了边区。
    有同志问他：“你身无半文，路又不熟，一个人怎样能回来？”
    他说：“我是走毛主席的路线回来的。”有些同志不明白他这话。他眼睛瞪了瞪，说：“不明白吗？毛主席的路线，就是群众路线嘛！我就是照着毛主席开的这条路线走回来的！”
