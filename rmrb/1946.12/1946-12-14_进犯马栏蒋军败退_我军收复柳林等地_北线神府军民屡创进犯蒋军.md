Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th. Chiang Kai-shek's troops, which launched attacks on the Malan area of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region from the southeast and southwest at the beginning of this month, have been repelled by the local army and people. The Liulin town and other places they occupied have been recovered by the Eighth Route Army. The 142nd Regiment of the 48th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's army stationed in Shanhezhen began to invade Qinjiadian, the Eighth Route Army's garrison seventy miles northwest of Malan, on the 9th. The local army and people are fighting heroically. At dawn on the 10th, Chiang Kai-shek's troops stationed in Beijianzhuang, north of Yijun, once occupied Guanmenzi, sixty miles northeast of Malan, but were immediately repelled by the local militia. During this invasion of Malan, Chiang Kai-shek's troops carried out widespread burning and killing along the way. Documents seized prove that this was done under the orders of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan to implement a thorough destruction policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 11th. Chiang Kai-shek's troops have repeatedly harassed the Shenfu border region in northern Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia. The 3rd Battalion of the 256th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's army, stationed in Qiaochatan, Shenmu, with more than 300 soldiers from two companies, invaded Sunijia Village in the 7th District of Shenfu on the morning of the 7th. They were bravely repelled by the local army and people, who killed or captured 21 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and seized 8 rifles and more than 500 rounds of ammunition. On the 19th of last month, in Rennian Gong Village in the 7th District, more than 30 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers harassed Gao Nian and Wen Villages. As soon as they entered the village entrance, they stepped on a landmine pre-buried by the militia, killing and wounding three people, and turned around and fled.
