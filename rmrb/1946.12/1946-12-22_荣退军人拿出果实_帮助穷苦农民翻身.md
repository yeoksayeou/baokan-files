　　Retired Soldiers Offer Fruits to Help Poor Farmers Turn Their Lives Around
　　[This Dispatch from Taiyue, 19th] Retired soldiers Gao Yushun and Gao Qichang are from Changzi Gao Village. After they retired and returned home, they still maintained the fine tradition of the Eighth Route Army sharing weal and woe with the masses. During the county-wide movement to return surplus fruits and equalize distribution, they returned the surplus fruits they had received. Gao Yushun and Gao Qichang joined the Eighth Route Army at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War and fought on the front lines, being wounded multiple times, resulting in disabilities. This summer, they retired and returned to their hometown, fighting alongside the masses against feudal forces. The masses, remembering their meritorious service in the Anti-Japanese War, actively led everyone to turn their lives around. When distributing fruits, they unanimously advocated giving them a larger share. However, during the winter investigation and reduction process, comrades Gao Yushun and Gao Qichang discovered that some of the masses in the village had not yet completely turned their lives around and were still experiencing difficulties. They voluntarily returned a portion of their materials to be distributed by the Farmers' Association to poor farmers.

　　荣退军人拿出果实
    帮助穷苦农民翻身
    【本报太岳十九日电】荣退军人郜玉顺、郜启昌是长子郜村人，他们荣退返家后，仍保持着八路军与群众同甘苦的优良传统，在全县退出多得果实，实行填平补齐的运动中，他们退出了自己多得的果实。郜玉顺、郜启昌抗战开始即参加八路军转战前方，屡次负伤，以致残废，今夏退伍还乡，与群众并肩向封建势力作斗争，群众念其抗战有功，并积极领导大家翻身，分配果实时一致主张给他们多分一点，但冬季查减中，郜玉顺、郜启昌两同志发现村中部分群众还未翻透身，生活仍困难，自动退出物资一部，交农会分配给贫苦农民。
