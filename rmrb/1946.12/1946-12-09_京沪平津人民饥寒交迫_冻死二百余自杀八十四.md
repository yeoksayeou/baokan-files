Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th. According to reports from the Associated Press and Dagong Bao: Many impoverished people under the rule of the Chiang government in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin are freezing to death in the bitter cold. At the end of November, more than 170 refugees and beggars froze to death in Tianjin in two days. In Shanghai, 50 people froze to death in a single day on the 29th. At Xiaguan in Nanjing, four refugees, old and young, froze to death at the same time. The number of refugees there has reached 13,000, who fled to Nanjing after suffering from floods in northern Anhui and not receiving due relief. In mid-November, seven people froze to death in one night in Beiping. Furthermore, according to the Beiping Daily, at least 20,000 households in Beiping are extremely poor, relying on porridge handouts from porridge kitchens to survive this winter. However, the porridge kitchens cannot supply so many poor people and only hand out porridge once a day, so a large number of poor people will be unable to survive this cold winter. Furthermore, according to incomplete statistics from the Xinmin Bao, 84 people committed suicide in Ping City from June to November, of which more than six-tenths committed suicide due to economic problems.

　　京沪平津人民饥寒交迫
  　冻死二百余自杀八十四
    【新华社延安六日电】据美联社大公报消息：蒋政府统治下的京沪平津有许多贫民在寒风凛冽中冻死。十一月底，天津两天内冻死难民及乞丐一百七十余人。上海二十九日一天内冻死五十人。南京下关一处同时期冻死难民老幼四人。该处难民已集至一万三千人，系在皖北遭受水灾未得应有救济而逃南京者。北平十一月中旬一夜冻死七人。又据北平日报称：北平最赤贫者至少有二万户，今冬赖粥厂打粥过活，但粥厂不能供应如许贫民，且每日仅打粥一次，故大批贫民将无法渡此寒冬。又据新民报不完全统计，平市自杀者自六月迄十一月间达八十四人，其中因经济问题自杀者达十分之六以上。
