　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 5th: Paris dispatch: The French Communist Party and the Socialist Party have reached an agreement on forming a cabinet. The Socialist Party National Congress, convened on the evening of the 3rd, decided to support the Communist leader Maurice Thorez as a candidate for Premier of the provisional government. Previously, the left and right wings of the Socialist Party Central Committee held divergent views on this issue, with the left supporting and the right opposing, leading to a stalemate. This resulted in the failure of the two parties' cabinet formation negotiations since the 29th of last month. Therefore, a national congress was convened to decide the matter.
