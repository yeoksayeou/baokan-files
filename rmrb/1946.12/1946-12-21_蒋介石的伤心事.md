　　Chiang Kai-shek's Sadness
　　Tang Pingzhu

　　It seems incredible to Chiang Kai-shek himself that his soldiers, having laid down their weapons in yesterday's battle, join the Eighth Route Army today and pick up weapons again to fight him. In the recent battle of Shangguan Village in Hua County, more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers joined the Eighth Route Army again. At the army joining conference, a certain military and political leader of the unit dined with them at the same table. Zhang Dejun, who had not yet taken off his American-style military cap, said, "I have been a soldier for seven or eight years, and this is the first time I have eaten at the same table with a leader." Li Jide, who was liberated in Juancheng a month ago, was seriously wounded in the battle of Hua County. When he was carried to the hospital, he was on the verge of death. Comrade Lei Fengqi, the medical section chief of a certain unit, transfused 100 cc of his own blood to save him. Another newly liberated soldier, Liu Chengren, was disabled due to his injuries and immediately settled down in a certain place in the liberated area, and the democratic government distributed four mu of land to him. Seeing that the liberated area had realized "land to the tiller" and everyone had been given land, they immediately thought of their own destroyed homes and scattered parents, wives, and children. Wang Xuezhi, who was liberated in the Ping-Han Campaign, was so grief-stricken and indignant when he accused Chiang Kai-shek of how he had been conscripted and how his parents had been beaten to death by the Lianbao chief that he almost went crazy. He said, "If my wife gives birth to a child in the future, I will first ask him if he wants to be a Chiang Kai-shek soldier. If he says yes, I will throw him to death to avoid future troubles." With awareness comes courage and wisdom. In the struggle against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, they not only fought bravely, but also shouted on the front lines to persuade the suffering brothers to lay down their weapons. In the counterattack in Lanfeng, the surrender of Chiang Kai-shek's eleven tanks was inseparable from the battlefield shouts of liberated soldiers Zhang Xingcai and others. Wen Zhenming, who came from the 3rd Reorganized Division, shouted in the battle of Juancheng, causing six soldiers of the 119th Brigade to lay down their weapons. In the battle of Shangguan Village, he shouted again, and forty-three soldiers of the 104th Brigade handed their guns to him. Yesterday, he was still a howitzer gunner painstakingly trained by Chiang Kai-shek's American godfather, but today he has become an Eighth Route Army howitzer gunner fighting for China's independence. Yesterday, he was still a tank driver used by Chiang Kai-shek as a tool for civil war, but today he has become an Eighth Route Army tank driver defending democracy and peace. Chiang Kai-shek helped us transport American weapons and sent us talents to use these weapons. Originally, workers and peasants were one family, but they were forced or deceived into taking a wrong path. Now, the Eighth Route Army extends a friendly hand to pull them out of the abyss of sin and let them throw away Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous hat and return to the embrace of the people. I remember a comrade named Yue Sanwa, who was liberated from the 30th Army, who was seriously wounded in the head during the battle. Even on his deathbed, he vaguely said, "I'm not even a Communist Party member yet." Isn't this Chiang Kai-shek's sadness?

　　蒋介石的伤心事
    唐平铸
    这似乎是蒋介石自己不可思议的事情，他的士兵在昨天的战斗中刚放下武器，今天就参加八路军，又重新拿起武器去跟他拚命。最近滑县上官村一战，就又有三千多蒋军士兵参加了八路军，在参军大会上，某部军政首长与他们同席会餐，还未脱去美式军帽的张德军说：“我当兵七八年，这还是第一次与首长同桌吃饭”。一月前在鄄城解放过来的李机德，在滑县作战中负了重伤，抬到医院时已奄奄一息，某部医务科长雷凤岐同志，为他输出自己的一百西西鲜血，把他救活了。另一新解放的战士刘成仁，因负伤残废，当即在解放区某地安家，民主政府分给他四亩地。他们看到解放区实现耕者有其田，人人分得土地，就立刻联想到自己被摧毁了的家园和离散了的父母妻儿。平汉战役解放过来的王学志，在控诉蒋介石如何抓他当兵，他的父母如何被联保主任打死的时候，他悲愤激昂的几乎发了疯，他说：“假如我老婆将来生下孩子，我首先问他当不当蒋军，他如果说当，我就把他摔死，免生后患”。有了觉悟就产生勇敢和智慧，在反对卖国贼蒋介石的进攻中，他们不仅英勇的战斗，而且在火线上喊话，劝那些受难的弟兄们放下武器。兰封反击战中，蒋介石十一辆坦克的投降，是与解放战士张星才等的战场喊话分不开的。整三师过来的闻振明，在鄄城作战中喊话，使六个一一九旅的士兵放下武器，上官村作战，他又喊话，四十三个一○四旅的士兵，又把枪交给他。昨天还是蒋介石请美国干爸爸苦心培养的榴弹炮手，今天却变成了为中国独立而战的八路军榴弹炮手。昨天还是蒋介石用作内战工具的坦克驾驶员，今天却变成了保卫民主和平的八路军的坦克驾驶员。蒋介石帮我们运来了美式武器，又给我们送来了使用这些武器的人材。本来工人农民原是一家，他们被迫或受骗走到岔路上，而今八路军伸出友爱的手，把他们从罪恶的深渊里拉出来，让他们摔掉蒋介石的卖国帽子，回到人民的怀抱里。记得有一位从三十军解放过来的岳三娃同志，在战斗中头部负了重伤，临终时他还迷糊不清地说：“我还不是共产党员哩”。难道这还不是蒋介石的伤心事吗？
