　　Yuanshi Captures Female Special Agent, Awakens, Repents, and Curses Chiang Kai-shek
    [Our Newspaper] Our army stationed in Yuanshi captured a female special agent named Su Heini in early November. After education, she has repented and reformed. Su is from Fucun village, southeast of Yuanshi city. In July of this year (lunar calendar), she was instigated and deceived by a Kuomintang special agent ×× into "learning" at the "Women's Volunteer School" in Shijiazhuang. This school is a special agent training institution established by the Fourth Precinct of the "Shimen Police Bureau," and has already trained three cohorts of female special agents. The special training focuses on techniques for undermining our army, requiring them to use their bodies as weapons to sabotage our troops. After completing the training in mid-September, she returned to Fucun, attempting to lure our soldiers under the guise of helping the Eighth Route Army sew cotton-padded clothes. However, the keen-eyed and intelligent soldiers of the people quickly saw through her and captured her. After our extensive education and rescue efforts, she has now escaped the special agent quagmire. After reforming, she gratefully said, "The Eighth Route Army patiently educated me, allowing me to escape the special agent hellhole. Teaching me to use my body to undermine the Eighth Route Army is the most shameless and despicable tactic of the Kuomintang reactionaries!" She bitterly denounced the conspiracies of Chiang's special agents, and said, "I hope that female compatriots who have suffered the same fate as me will quickly confess and reform to the liberated area government. In front of the Eighth Route Army, the honey trap is useless."

　　元氏捕获一女特觉悟自新骂蒋贼
    【本报讯】驻元氏我军某部，于十一月初捕获一女特务名苏黑妮，经教育结果，已悔过自新。苏是元氏城东南富村人，今年阴历七月受国特××挑唆骗入石家庄“妇女志愿学校”“学习”。该校为“石门警察局”第四分所专设之特务训练机关，已训练女特务三期。专训以破坏我军之技术，要他们以肉体代替武器来破坏我军。九月中旬受训完毕，回到富村，以帮助八路军缝棉衣为名，企图引诱我战士。但人民子弟兵眼明心灵，很快即将其识破捕获。经我多方教育挽救，刻已跳出特务泥坑。她于自新后感谢地说：“八路军耐心的教育我，使我跳出了特务火坑；教我用肉体破坏八路军，是国民党反动派最无耻的卑鄙手段”！她沉痛的控诉蒋特的阴谋，并说：“希望受过和我一样遭遇的女同胞们，赶快向解放区政府坦白自新。八路军面前，美人计是无用的”。
