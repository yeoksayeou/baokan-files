    [This Dispatch from the Taiyue Front, 11th of this month] After the recovery of Yuanqu County, the democratic political power in the areas occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops has been fully restored. The county government moved into the city with the army on the 6th to carry out appeasement and relief work. The Taiyue Administrative Office has specially allocated 14,000 jin of millet to relieve the refugees ravaged by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and another 60 shi of millet to reward model cadres and active elements among the masses in logistics work during this campaign. When our army advanced towards the suburbs of Yuanqu city on the 5th, 23 village cadres from Chen Village, Huafeng Town, Baotou, Feng Village, Sanjian, and other 13 villages, who had been transferred to the interior, set out with the army. Therefore, political power was immediately restored wherever our army arrived, and the masses were mobilized to support the front line. After the recovery of Wangmao Town, the masses elected Wang, an active element in the land reform, as the village head, and more than ten militiamen maintained social order and eliminated Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. Dozens of farmers, including An Lide, who were imprisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, were freed at the same time as Yuanqu city. An Lide has now returned home. The masses have been accusing the Chiang Kai-shek troops of arbitrarily arresting and killing farmers. At present, the masses in various villages are thoroughly destroying more than 80 blockhouses and fortifications left by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The villages of Song Village, Nanyao, and Xiahao have already destroyed them.
