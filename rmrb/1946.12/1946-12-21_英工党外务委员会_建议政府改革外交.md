　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. United Press International, London, 17th: Well-informed sources said today that the Labour Party Foreign Affairs Committee held a secret meeting last night and unanimously passed a report recommending that any British ambassadors and other diplomatic personnel who fail to accurately represent the views of the Labour government should be removed or recalled. The report was drafted by a sub-committee after eight months of research, suggesting that the British Foreign Office take certain reform steps and eliminate the influence of diplomatic officials who have long been immersed in the policies of the Conservative government.

    建议政府改革外交
    【新华社延安十八日电】合众社伦敦十七日电称：今日消息灵通方面说：工党外务委员会于昨晚举行秘密会议，一致通过了报告，建议凡英国驻外大使及其他外交人员，如未能确切代表工党政府之意见者，应予撤免或召回。该报告系由一小组委员会于八个月研究后草成，建议英外交部采取某种改革步骤，并使外交部祛除久已浸染保守党政府政策的草案外交员们的影响。
