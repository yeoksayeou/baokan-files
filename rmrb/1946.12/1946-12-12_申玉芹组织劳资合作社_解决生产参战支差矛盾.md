    Shen Yuqin Organizes Labor-Capital Cooperative
    Resolves Contradictions Between Production, Participation in War, and Support the Front
    [This newspaper] According to a report from the LiCheng Joint Office, the labor-capital cooperative led by the county's famous labor hero Shen Yuqin has unified production, supporting the front, participating in war, and standing guard, appropriately resolving the difficulties of combining participation in war with production, and has achieved significant results. Shen Yuqin's team has a total of thirty households (including four households of families of revolutionary soldiers), with a total of 475 mu of land, two mules, nine donkeys, twenty-seven full laborers, and two half laborers. After the autumn harvest, they immediately turned to sideline production, organizing a flour mill, a cotton gin, and a saltpeter workshop. The rest were organized into a labor-capital cooperative. When the militia of this team participates in the war, each person is given 100 yuan for expenses on the way per day. For each day of participation in the war, the cooperative credits them with one labor day. The amount of labor the entire cooperative owes for supporting the front is requested from the cooperative for payment to those who were supporting the front. Finally, the money from the people's work is taken back, the cooperative keeps accounts, and then the average number of workdays each person should contribute is calculated and labor credits are deducted. Standing guard for one night counts as four "xiang" (a unit of time, roughly a quarter day) of labor. If two people stand guard, each person is credited with two "xiang." Currently, the cooperative has hired two elderly men in their fifties to stand guard and deliver errands, and they are credited with labor according to regulations. Finally, based on the total number of workdays used for production, participating in the war, supporting the front, and standing guard, the net profits are distributed according to the labor performed. In this way, everyone is at ease and no one shirks their responsibilities. All teams in the village have organized labor-capital cooperatives that combine support for the front, participation in war, and production.

    申玉芹组织劳资合作社
    解决生产参战支差矛盾
    【本报讯】据黎城联合办公室报导，该县著名劳动英雄申玉芹领导的劳资合作社，把生产、支差、参战、站岗统一结合起来，适当的解决了参战与生产结合的困难，取得了显著成绩。申玉芹队共三十户（内有抗属四户），全队土地四百七十五亩、骡二头，驴九头、全劳力二十七个、半劳力二个，秋收结束后，即转入副业生产，组织粉坊一座、轧花车一辆、硝坊一座，其余组织成一个劳资合作社。本队民兵参战时，路上每人一天发给一百元盘费，参战出去一天社里给计一个劳力，整个社里劳力该多少，勤工抗勤向社里拨，最后得回勤工米、社里收起账，再按应出勤工劳力平均每个人应摊数，扣除其劳力工。站岗一夜计四晌劳力工，如果是两个人站，每人给计两晌，现社里吸收了两个五十多岁的老汉给站岗、送差，给他按规定计劳力工。最后按生产参战、支差、站岗，总用工数，把净红利按工批开，这样谁也安心也不推诿。全村各个队都组织了支差、参战、生产统一结合的劳资合作社。
