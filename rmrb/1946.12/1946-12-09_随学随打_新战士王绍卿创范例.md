　　Learning and Fighting Simultaneously
  　New Soldier Wang Shaoqing Creates a Model
    [This newspaper's special dispatch from the front lines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan] New soldier Wang Shaoqing learned and fought simultaneously on the battlefield, and the unit leaders called on all commanders and fighters to learn from him. Comrade Wang Shaoqing of the First Platoon, Third Company, First Battalion, of a certain unit's First Regiment participated in the battle to block the enemy's reinforcements as soon as he arrived at the unit. He carried a small cannon but didn't know how to use it. The enemy rushed up quickly, and he hurriedly ran to the company commander, asking the company commander to quickly tell him how to fire it. After the company commander told him the usage very simply, he immediately started firing at the enemy, and the first shot hit the enemy concentrated among the graves, knocking down four or five. This shot increased his confidence, and he continued to fire shot after shot, each time wounding two or three enemies. During the battle, he used up all the shells, causing great frustration to the enemy. At the military conference of a certain unit, Chief of Staff Zhao spoke, especially praising Comrade Wang Shaoqing, who learned and fought simultaneously on the battlefield, and called on all comrades to learn from him.

　　随学随打
  　新战士王绍卿创范例
    【本报冀鲁豫前线特讯】新战士王绍卿在战场上随学随打，部队首长号召全体指战员向他学习。×部一团一营三连一班王绍卿同志，刚到部队就参加了阻击敌人增援部队的战斗，他扛一个小炮但不会用。敌人很快就冲上来了，他急忙跑到连长那里，叫连长赶快告诉他怎样打，连长很简单的告诉他使用法后，他马上就照敌人打起来，头一炮就打到集中在坟头间的敌人，打倒了四、五个。从这一炮增加了他的信心，继续一炮一炮打出去，每次敌人总要伤两三个。战斗中他将炮弹全打光了，给了敌人很大的搓伤。在×部军人大会上赵参谋长讲话，特别表扬了在战场上随击随打的王绍卿同志，并号召全体同志向他学习。
