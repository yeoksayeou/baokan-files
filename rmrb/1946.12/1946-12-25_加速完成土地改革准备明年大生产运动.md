　　In the past six months, under the situation of Chiang Kai-shek launching a large-scale traitorous civil war and comprehensively attacking our liberated areas, the people in our areas have implemented land reform, thereby winning continuous victories in the patriotic self-defense war. Moreover, the victory of the self-defense war has encouraged the masses to turn over and protect the implementation of land reform. This is an unprecedented great achievement.

　　The experience of the past six months tells us that in areas where land reform is well integrated with the self-defense war, where the masses are fully mobilized, and where land is thoroughly resolved, support for the front lines, participation in the army and war, guaranteed supplies, and preparedness work are done well. The turning over of the masses and the implementation of land reform are more guaranteed. Even if some places are temporarily occupied by the enemy, they can retreat in an orderly manner and quickly launch guerrilla warfare, conduct counter-attacks, and recover lost territories. Conversely, the results are the opposite.

　　Any area that boldly mobilizes the vast number of peasants, thoroughly eliminates feudalism, can follow the mass line well, unite with the middle peasants, enable the peasants to liberate themselves, personally solve the land problem, and give appropriate care to all kinds of people, the masses will be fully mobilized, and the land will be thoroughly resolved, and can truly maintain more than 90% of the people in the countryside with us, and can consolidate the rural united front against civil war, anti-feudalism, and dictatorship.

　　In the peasant movement, in any major mobilization period, it is impossible to completely eliminate the deeply rooted feudal forces all at once, and there must be omissions and remnants. It is also impossible to fully mobilize the vast number of peasants all at once, and there must be advanced, intermediate, and backward parts, and there must be internal disputes among the peasants. At the same time, it is also impossible to universally mobilize the scattered rural areas all at once, and there must be remaining problems, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to do a good job of in-depth consolidation work in order to fully mobilize the masses and eliminate feudalism. It is wrong to be satisfied with the achievements of the development stage and not see the inevitable defects. However, it is also wrong to think that it cannot be completely resolved in one go, neglect in-depth consolidation work, end it too early, and transfer to production, leaving it to be done later. Repeated inspections and reductions every year will hinder the development of production.

　　Since late autumn and early winter, land reform in our region has successively entered a period of in-depth consolidation, and a widespread movement of checking for turn-over and filling in the gaps is currently underway. Various places have created many experiences, and the achievements are very great. We should summarize the experiences of various places well and further resolve the following issues in order to complete land reform from this winter to the spring plowing season.

　　1. The work of turn-over inspection and gap-filling should continue to be implemented in areas where the land problem has not been resolved. Inspection should be mass-based. It is wrong for a few cadres and activists to substitute and take over. It is necessary to follow the mass line, get the cadres to understand, transform their work style, and consciously help the masses who have not thoroughly turned over and the blank villages, fully mobilize the masses who have not turned over, and cultivate new activists, so that all peasants who have not received or received less land in the past can get land.

　　Filling in the gaps is generally done by not moving the middle (the land of the middle peasants will not be moved resolutely) and moving both ends (filling in the land that the landlords and rich peasants should take out to the landless and land-poor peasants). If all the middle peasants are leveled, and the rich villages and poor villages are leveled, the idealized absolute average is actually impossible. If there is accumulated land and property that has not been distributed, it should be distributed immediately. If individual cadres and activists have obtained too much land and are dissatisfied by the majority of the masses, they should be persuaded in good faith to consciously and voluntarily return a portion to the masses. In general, those who are about the same should not be moved again. If the land of the middle peasants has been damaged, it should be firmly compensated from the inspected land, and special attention should be paid to taking care of the families of soldiers, workers, and cadres, especially the poor industrialists and merchants should insist on taking care of them and not change them. If the landlord cannot live, he should be given appropriate care and help to engage in production. Only in this way can we win the sympathy of more than 90% of the people and carry out the anti-Chiang self-defense war and defend the liberated areas.

　　In the old areas, it can be divided into several types of villages. In places where there are still many remaining land problems, the focus should be on turn-over inspection and gap-filling, but the principle of not harming middle peasants and new rich peasants must be observed, and combined with the demands of the masses, cooperate with winter production work. In places where land reform has been completed, winter production should be the main focus, using mediation methods, combined with clearing up individual land problems, reorganizing production organizations, and preparing for the great production movement next spring.

　　2. In the border areas, the policy of combining guerrilla warfare with land reform should be implemented. The deceptive policies of Chiang and Yan's "fake rent reduction" and "integration of soldiers and farmers" must be exposed. The mass turn-over movement should be coordinated with guerrilla joint defense, and all gaps should be used to implement land reform. Such as local corps besieging strongholds, attacking behind enemy lines to draw firewood from under the pot, containing the enemy to create gaps, or using intelligence to eliminate traitors and joint defense as a link. One hand holding a gun, one hand dividing the land, creating a situation where local tyrants and landlords dare not reverse the case and change the sky. The liquidation methods in some areas, first large and then small, hitting accurately and ruthlessly, narrow the scope of attack, widen the scope of benefit, those who run away leave sin, those who stay at home leave life, enlightened people dedicate land, resolutely crack down on local tyrants and landlords, appropriately take care of small and medium landlords, quick struggle and quick division, divide what is lacking, and give appropriate care to all kinds of people. These experiences have proven to be very good.

　　In areas temporarily occupied by Chiang's army or guerrilla areas, armed work teams should be organized to implement unified leadership by the Party, government, army, and people, destroy Chiang and Yan's special agent organizations and armed forces, mobilize the masses to "oppose the reversal of settlements" and "oppose the reversal of cases," suppress major traitors and local bullies, recover the land and property of the masses, and continue to carry out land reform. The experience of the "anti-settlement reversal" movement in the Taiyue and Jiluyu areas is very good. Various regions can also create new experiences to better combine guerrilla warfare with land reform.

　　3. In areas where the land problem has been completely resolved and the masses have been fully mobilized, a period of ideological education should be carried out to improve the class consciousness of the masses and consolidate the turn-over ideologically. From the personal experience of the masses, inspire the masses to deeply understand: (1) The world is created by the working people, the fields are cultivated by us, the houses are built by us, the clothes are woven by us, the landlords are supported by us, and the laborers are the masters of the world who open up the world and build society. (2) The peasant masses are the masters of the land. For two thousand years, they have been exploited, ruled, enslaved, and made into cattle and horses. Today, they have been liberated and realized that the tiller owns his land. This great revolution is led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Always follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and the turn-over is guaranteed. (3) Chiang Kai-shek colludes with American imperialism and wants to be a puppet emperor, wholeheartedly selling the country, engaging in dictatorship, fighting a civil war, attacking the liberated areas, and destroying the tiller's ownership of his land. We swear not to be slaves of a fallen country and no longer be feudal cattle and horses. Arm ourselves to participate in the patriotic self-defense war, defend the liberated areas, and defend the "lifeline" (land). (4) Why has our country been bullied by imperialism for nearly a hundred years, and why are we poor? It is because the "root of poverty is too deep" (long-term feudal exploitation) and the "root of wealth is too shallow" (lack of capitalism). Therefore, we "pulled out the root of poverty" and must "plant the root of wealth," develop production, prosper the economy, and build an independent, peaceful, democratic, prosperous, and strong new China. Various places have created many vivid and lively experiences in the method of this education, such as using turn-over recollections, thinking meetings, celebration meetings, exhibitions, hero meetings, summarizing experiences, and combining participation in the army and war preparation to carry out education. In particular, the good experiences of winter school education in the past few years should be greatly promoted and a widespread winter school movement should be launched.

　　At the same time, attention should also be paid to completing the work of organizational construction, greatly developing and consolidating farmers' associations, developing, transforming, and mastering militia armed forces, and developing and consolidating Party organizations. Village and district democratic governments should be transformed and built on the basis of farmers' associations, mass organizations, militia pillars, and Party leadership, but the focus should be on the construction of branches and militias. Mass leaders should be cultivated and promoted, democratic work styles should be established, and the relationship between cadres and the masses should be improved.

　　On the basis of ideological education and organizational construction, mutual assistance and cooperation should be organized in a timely manner to carry out winter production and prepare for the great production movement next year. It must be repeatedly explained to the masses that this time the land reform will be thoroughly done, and it will not be carried out again in the future. After the land reform is completed, the border area government will issue new laws guaranteeing land rights and property rights, calling on the masses to engage in production, start a family with diligence and thrift, and get rich.

　　Now, land reform in our region is about to succeed, and the great production movement is about to start. We must not be complacent, and we must remember the ancient训 of "he who walks a hundred miles is halfway at ninety." Make another effort to thoroughly complete this great and arduous undertaking before the spring plowing - in order to lay a solid foundation for the great production movement next spring.

### 加速完成土地改革准备明年大生产运动

　　加速完成土地改革准备明年大生产运动
    半年以来，在蒋介石发动大规模卖国内战，全面向我解放区进攻的局面下，我区人民实行了土地改革，从而赢得爱国自卫战争的不断胜利，又由于自卫战争的胜利，又鼓舞了群众翻身，保护了土地改革的实行，这是一件空前的伟大业绩。
    半年来的经验告诉我们：凡是土地改革与自卫战争结合得好，群众发动充分，土地解决彻底的地区，支援前线，参军参战，保证供给，备战工作就做的好，群众翻身与土地改革也就愈有保证。即使有些地方暂被敌人侵占，亦能有秩序的撤退，并能迅速的开展游击战争，进行反攻、收复失地。反之，结果就相反。
    凡是放手发动广大农民，彻底消灭封建，能很好的走群众路线，团结中农，使农民自己解放自己，亲自动手来解决土地问题，并给各色人等以适当照顾的地区，群众发动的就充分，土地解决的就彻底，就能真正保持农村中百分之九十以上的人和我们一道，并能巩固反内战反封建独裁的农村统一战线。
    在农民运动中，任何一个大发动时期，对根深蒂固的封建势力都不可能一下子彻底消灭，必有遗漏残余存在，对广大农民也不可能一下子充分发动起来，必有先进中间与落后部分，必有农民内部纠纷问题，同时对分散的农村，亦不可能一下子普遍发动起来，必有遗留问题等。因此，必须很好的来做深入巩固工作，才能充分发动群众，扫清封建，如果只满足于大发展阶段的成就，而看不见不可避免的缺陷是不对的。但是如果认为反正一次不能彻底解决，忽视深入巩固工作，过早的结束，转入生产，留待以后再做的想法也是错误的。每年反复查减是会防碍发展生产的。
    我区土地改革，秋末入冬以来，先后已转入深入巩固时期，目前正在普遍进行翻身大检查、填平补齐运动，各地创造许多经验，成绩是很大的。我们应该很好总结各地的经验，进一步解决以下几个问题，以便于今冬到春耕前完成土地改革。
    一、翻身检查，填平补齐的工作，在土地问题尚未解决的地区，应继续贯彻。检查应是群众性的，少数干部积极分子代替包办不对，要走群众路线，搞通干部思想，改造作风，自觉的帮助翻身不彻底的群众与空白村，充分发动未翻身的群众，培养新积极分子，使所有过去未分得或分得地少的农民，都能得到土地。
    填平补齐大体上是当中不动（中农土地坚决不动）两头动（把地主富农应拿出的土地填平无地少地的农民）的办法。如果把中农一律推平，把富村与穷村一律推平，理想化地绝对平均实际是不可能的。如有积押尚未分配的土地物财，应立即分配。如有个别干部积极分子分得土地太多，而为大多数群众所不满者，应善意说服，使其自觉自愿归还群众一部分，一般差不多的不应再动。如有中农土地被损害者，应坚决从检查出的土地中给以补偿，并应特别注意照顾抗属、工属、干属，尤其是贫苦的工商业应坚持照顾，不可变动。如有地主无法生活，应给以适当照顾及帮助其从事生产。如此才能争取百分之九十以上的人同情和我们一道进行反蒋自卫战争，保卫解放区。
    在老区可分几类村进行，在土地问题遗留尚多的地方，应以翻身检查，填平补齐工作为主，但必须遵守不伤害中农与新富农的原则，并结合群众要求，配合以冬季生产工作。在土地改革已经完成的地方，应以冬季生产为主，采用调解办法，结合清理个别的土地问题，整理生产组织，准备明春大生产运动。
    二、在边沿地区，应实行游击战争与土地改革结合的方针。必须揭破蒋阎的“假减租”和“兵农合一”的欺骗政策。使群众翻身运动与游击联防相配合，利用一切空隙，实行土地改革。如地方兵团围困据点，出击敌后釜底抽薪，牵制敌人造成空隙，或以情报除奸联防为纽带。一手拿枪，一手分田，造成恶霸地主不敢翻案变天。某些地区的清算方法，先大后小，打的准而狠，打击面窄，得利面宽，跑了留罪恶，在家留生活，开明的献田，坚决打击恶霸地主，适当照顾中小地主，快斗快分，缺啥分啥，给各色人等适当照顾。这些经验，证明都是很好的。
    在暂被蒋军侵占地区或游击区，应组织武工队，实行党政军民统一领导，摧毁蒋阎特务组织和武装，发动群众“反倒算”“反翻案”，镇压大汉奸恶霸，追还群众土地财产，继续进行土地改革。如太岳与冀鲁豫区“反倒算”运动的经验是很好的，各地区还可以创造新经验，把游击战与土地改革更好结合起来。
    三、在土地问题已经彻底解决，群众已经充分发动的地区，应即大力进行一个时期的思想教育工作，提高群众阶级觉悟，从思想上巩固翻身。从群众切身的经验中启发群众深刻领会：（一）世界是劳动人民创造的，田地是我们耕植的，房屋是我们盖造的，衣服是我们纺织的，地主是靠我们养活的，劳动者是开天辟地建设社会的主人翁。（二）农民大众是田地的主人，两千年来受剥削、被统治、当奴隶、做牛马，今天得到解放，实现了耕者有其田，这个大革命是毛主席、共产党领导的，永远跟着毛主席共产党走，翻身有保证。（三）蒋介石勾结美帝国主义想当儿皇帝，一心卖国独裁打内战，进攻解放区，破坏耕者有其田，我们誓死不当亡国奴，不再做封建牛马，武装起来参加爱国自卫战争，保卫解放区，保卫“命根子”（土地）。（四）近百年来我国为什么一直受帝国主义的欺负，我们受穷就是因为“穷根太深”（长久的封建剥削）和“富根太浅”（缺少资本主义），所以我们“拔掉了穷根”，必须“按植富根”，发展生产，繁荣经济，建设独立、和平、民主、富强的新中国。此种教育的方法，各地创造了好多生动活泼的经验，如用翻身大回忆，想想会，庆祝会，展览会，群英会，总结经验以及结合参军备战实际行动进行教育，特别是几年来冬学教育的好经验，都应大大发扬，普遍开展冬学运动。
    同时还应注意完成组织建设的工作，大量发展与巩固农会，发展改造并掌握民兵武装，发展与巩固党的组织。应在农会群众、民兵支柱、党的领导的基础上改造和建设村区民主政权，但其重点应放在支部与民兵建设上。并应培养提拔群众领袖，树立民主作风，改善干部与群众的关系。
    在思想教育与组织建设的基础上，应及时的组织互助合作，进行冬季生产和准备明年的大生产运动。必须反复向群众说明，这次把土地改革做到彻底，以后再不进行。土地改革完竣，边区政府即将颁布保障地权、财权的新法令，号召群众进行生产，勤俭起家，发财致富。
    现在，我区土地改革快要成功，生产大运动行将开工，我们切勿自满，要切记“行百里者半九十”的古训，再努一把力，争取在春耕以前，彻底完成这件伟大艰巨的事业——以便给来春的大生产运动奠定坚固的基础。
