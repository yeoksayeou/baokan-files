　　The War Situation Begins to Change
    Liberation Daily Editorial
    November marked the fifth month of the all-out civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek with the help of American imperialist elements. This month was the turning point in the war situation, with Chiang's army beginning to turn defensive and the People's Liberation Army beginning to turn offensive.
    In November, the People's Liberation Army eliminated six brigades of Chiang's army, which, together with the thirty-three brigades eliminated from July to October, totaled thirty-nine brigades (excluding over 60,000 puppet troops and local security forces eliminated). Chiang's army, however, has not yet managed to eliminate even one of our battalions. In November, Chiang's army occupied seventeen county towns in the liberated areas, while the People's Liberation Army recovered and liberated fifteen county towns. These figures indicate that the previous situation has begun to change. In the past, Chiang's army gained territory at the cost of significant manpower; but in November, Chiang's army continued to pay a heavy price but barely gained any territory.
    In November, under the smoke screen of Chiang Kai-shek's "cease-fire order," Chiang's army launched nine major offensives. The offensive against Yan'an had been prepared for a long time but had not yet been launched. The nine offensives were as follows: First, the offensive against the southern section of the Pinghan Railway met with a severe blow from General Liu Bocheng's troops, with over ten thousand enemy troops annihilated; second, the offensive against Lianshui and Shuyang in northern Jiangsu met with stubborn resistance from General Su Yu's troops, and the offensive faltered; third, Chiang's army advanced from the Taierzhuang area to Linyi but was repelled by our Shandong troops, retreating back to the Taizao line with heavy losses; fourth, Chiang's army attacked Longkou and Yantai along the Jiaoji Railway, suffering heavy losses under our army's stubborn resistance, only occupying Pingdu and Yexian, and still far from Longkou and even further from Yantai; fifth, the offensive against the Tonghua area in Northeast China, where its 25th Division was completely annihilated, only to occupy three cities including Kuandian; sixth, the offensive against the Yixian area in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway was also repelled by our army; seventh, the offensive against Wei County along the PingSui Railway; eighth, Gu Zhutong's offensive against Puyang, both of which Chiang's army considered successful due to our army's proactive transfer; ninth, Li Mo'an's offensive against Yancheng, which is still ongoing.
    This is the picture of the war situation in November. From this picture, there is no other conclusion to be drawn except the following: Chiang's army, except for a few local areas where it still has tactical initiative, has globally turned its initiative into a passive position. Conversely, our People's Liberation Army has broken free from its passive position and begun to turn to the offensive.
    The offensive temporarily displayed by Chiang's army after being injected with a stimulant by American imperialists has begun to decline. Chiang's army is already experiencing great difficulties due to insufficient troops and war-weariness. In contrast, the People's Liberation Army has eliminated illusions about the U.S. and Chiang, learned to fight mobile warfare, gained much combat experience, and acquired excellent weapons sent by Chiang Kai-shek, thereby improving its combat effectiveness.
    Looking ahead to the war situation, Chiang Kai-shek may still concentrate his forces to launch offensives in a few local areas. Our People's Liberation Army must be vigilant about this possibility and must not be negligent in the slightest. However, in terms of the overall war situation, Chiang Kai-shek has already begun to turn defensive. When he concentrates his forces to launch an offensive against some of our areas, he will give our army an opportunity to completely crush his offensive in that area and launch a counter-offensive in his area. Therefore, as long as the military and civilians in the liberated areas work hard to seize the initiative, another feature of the war situation in the future will be the increasing number and size of our army's counter-offensives.
    The great change in the war situation requires our People's Liberation Army soldiers and the people and democrats of the whole country to be ideologically prepared and not to miss the opportunity to cope with the new situation.
    First, we must not harbor any illusions about American imperialist elements and Chiang Kai-shek. American imperialist elements, on the one hand, use the Chinese people's eagerness for peace to deceive them, and on the other hand, openly and secretly provide the autocratic tyrant Chiang Kai-shek with massive aid to launch an all-out civil war. This two-faced approach is manifested in the hands of American imperialists with more sophisticated, more vicious, and therefore more shameless and more cruel methods. The deception of American imperialists is different from others. It is not only said verbally but also signed in black and white. After the Byrnes statement, there was the Truman statement, the signing of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference resolution, and the signing of the ceasefire agreement, troop reorganization plan, and Northeast China ceasefire agreement. People saw these repeated statements and repeated signatures and thought that, according to common sense and ordinary human morality, they should be serious and count. Is it possible that even things allowed by such solemn signatures are unreliable? If the U.S. government wants to have any dealings with the Chinese people in the future, rather than wanting to have no dealings with them from now on, it should at least abide by the credit of its signatures! It is not surprising that the Chinese people think this way, because according to common sense, this is a legitimate idea. Therefore, the Chinese people thought that peace had arrived and democracy was promising. Who knew that what the American imperialist elements wanted was not credit, but only to make the Chinese people lose their vigilance so that they would not be prepared for the reactionary attacks. To this end, they would not hesitate to lose the basic conditions of being human and would not need to have any dealings with the Chinese people in the future. The American imperialist elements used this idea to completely make the Chinese people lose their vigilance, while fully helping Chiang Kai-shek to take advantage of the Chinese people's lack of preparedness to knock the Chinese people to the ground with one blow. As long as this is done, there will naturally be no need to have any dealings with the Chinese people in the future. Therefore, the American imperialist elements, on the one hand, put on a smiling face and greatly deceived the Chinese people, and on the other hand, mustered murderous intent and greatly helped Chiang Kai-shek, all in order to knock the Chinese people down with one blow. This is the vicious plan of the American imperialist elements. As for Chiang Kai-shek's deceptive methods and slaughter methods being used in conjunction with each other in order to achieve the same goal of the aforementioned American imperialist elements - to eliminate the strength of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have more experience and deeper vigilance, so there is no need to say more.
    At the same time, we want to re-emphasize that the power of American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek is not terrible. Chiang Kai-shek launched this all-out civil war and predicted that he could "eliminate the Communist Party" in three to five months. He made this estimate based on his power. Where is his power? It lies in the 400 million US dollars of weapons and materials and loans from the United States, in his accumulation during the three or four years of passive resistance against Japan, in his 1.5 million direct-line troops, in the 700,000 to 800,000 puppet troops he "recruited," and in the 50 trillion yuan of Japanese weapons, property, factories, warehouses, and grain he "received." Chiang Kai-shek's these forces were used in this war to make a desperate gamble, but after only five months of fighting, they were almost exhausted. The reactionaries are not without power, but because they themselves are rotten to the core, having these massive materials and military power is of no use. The five months since July have passed, and Chiang Kai-shek is now planning another five months of combat. It is said that he wants to eliminate the People's Liberation Army in the next five months. This is Chiang Kai-shek's plan, but from the perspective of the People's Liberation Army, the past five months have been able to eliminate 39 brigades of Chiang's army. Can't the same number of Chiang's army be eliminated in the next five months? The People's Liberation Army soldiers are capable of doing so.
    We must also estimate that when Chiang Kai-shek's power is exhausted, the American imperialists may help him again, such as the 500 million US dollars being discussed as a loan, and the US-Chiang agreement to use Japanese soldiers as Chiang's army commanders, etc. But these will be even less effective than before.
    As our army on the battlefield begins to turn to the offensive, Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis has certainly arrived, and his political crisis may also arrive. What should the Chinese people do at this time? They should take resolute action, seize the initiative, resolutely counter-attack where counter-attacks are possible, resolutely prepare for counter-attacks where counter-attacks should be prepared, actively restore strength where strength should be restored, accumulate strength in a way that suits the current environment where strength should be prepared, and more boldly turn to the counter-offensive after eliminating its invading army where Chiang's army still dares to attack.
    In combat, in the past few months, many of our corps have learned to fight mobile warfare and attack strongholds. Those who have not yet learned it in some places should learn it quickly. The style of dispersing forces to defend everywhere is not good. We should concentrate our forces to annihilate the enemy's living forces. It should be known that Chiang Kai-shek's invading army should be annihilated in large numbers and can be annihilated in large numbers. Therefore, we mainly rely on fighting mobile warfare to annihilate the enemy and strive for victory in the war. Guerrilla warfare must be developed in many places and has a significant role in the entire war, but in terms of the overall war situation, it is an auxiliary aspect. Today, on the one hand, we must not underestimate the enemy. We should make full preparations before each battle. On the other hand, we must not overestimate the enemy and underestimate ourselves. Except for certain areas where the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves requires our army to use mobile warfare as an auxiliary for its benefit or to use both equally for its benefit, other places should strive to concentrate forces and use continuous day-and-night tenacious fighting methods to annihilate the enemy.
    One of the useful experiences in the recent months of combat is the large-scale transfer of mobile warfare. The Battle of Juancheng and the Battle of Hua County are good examples. Another experience is to defend by attacking, such as using the Battle of Lüliang to defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the Taiyue Liberated Area. These new experiences must be used extensively under appropriate circumstances to completely crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, recover all lost land, and unswervingly strive to restore the position of January 13 and the line of the Political Consultative Conference.

　　战局在开始变动
    解放日报社论
    十一月份，是蒋介石在美国的帝国主义分子帮助之下发动全面内战的第五个月。这一月是战局开始转变的月份，是蒋军开始转入被动而人民解放军则开始转入主动的月份。
    十一月份，人民解放军消灭蒋军六个旅，连七月至十月的三十三个旅一起计算，共达三十九个旅（消灭伪军及地方保安队六万余人在外），约占蒋介石全部进犯军二百个旅的五分之一。蒋军则仍旧至今没有一次能把我军一个营消灭。十一月份，蒋军占领解放区十七个县城，人民解放军则收复与解放了十五个县城。这个数字，说明以往的情势已开始改变，已往的情势是蒋军以重大的有生力量的代价换得地方；而十一月份则不然，蒋军依然付出重大的代价，但已经连地方也换不到几个了。
    十一月份，在蒋介石“停战令”的烟幕之下，蒋军作了九次大的进攻，其对延安的进攻准备了很久，但尚未发动。九次进攻如下：一是对平汉路南段的攻势遇到刘伯承将军所部的痛击，万余人被歼；二是对苏北涟水沭阳的进攻，遇到粟裕将军所部的顽抗，攻势顿挫；三是蒋军由台儿庄地区进犯临沂，被山东我军打退，缩回台枣线，损失重大；四是蒋军由胶济路进攻龙口烟台，在我军顽抗下损失重大，仅占平度掖县二城，至今还离龙口很远，离烟台更远；五是对东北通化地区的进攻，其二十五师被彻底歼灭，才占领了宽甸等三个城；六是对平汉北段易县地区的进攻，亦被我军打退；七是平绥线对蔚县的进攻；八是顾祝同对濮阳的进攻，这两次因我军主动转移，蒋军算是达到了目的；九是李默庵对盐城的进攻，现时还在战斗中。
    这就是十一月份战局的图画。从这一幅图画中，除了得出下列的结论外，再无别的结论。这个结论就是蒋军除几个局部地区尚有战役性的主动以外，就全局看来它的主动已转为被动，与此相反，我人民解放军则由被动中脱身出来开始转入主动。
    蒋军由美国的帝国主义者打了强心针而暂时表现出来的攻势，已经开始衰退了；蒋军已经因为兵力不足与军心厌战而感到极大困难了。与这相反，人民解放军消除了对美蒋的幻想，学会了打运动战，获得了许多战斗经验，获得了蒋介石送来的优良武器，因而将自己的战斗力提高了。
    预料今后的战局，蒋介石还有可能集中兵力在几个局部地区举行进攻。对于这个可能，我人民解放军必须警惕，切不可稍有疏忽。但是就整个战局来说，蒋介石既已开始转入被动，那天当他集中兵力向我某些地区举行攻势的时候，就给了我军以机会在该地区彻底粉碎其进攻，并在他的地区展开反攻。因而只要解放区军民大家努力争取主动，今后战局的又一特点将是我军的反攻日益增多和日益增大。
    战局的大转变，需要我人民解放军将士和全国人民与民主人士在思想上有所准备，且不要错失时机去应付新的局面。
    首先我们必须再勿对美国的帝国主义分子和蒋介石抱任何的幻想。美国的帝国主义分子，一面利用中国人民切望和平的心理进行欺骗，另一面明里暗里给专制王蒋介石以大量援助以发动全面内战。这种两面手法，在美国的帝国主义者手里表现得手段更高明，更毒辣，因而也更无耻更残忍。美国的帝国主义者，他的欺骗与众不同，不但口头上说说，而且硬是白纸上签上黑字。贝纳斯声明之后，有杜鲁门声明，有莫斯科三国外长会议决议的签字，还有停战协议、整军方案、东北停战协定上的签字，人们看见了这些再三的声明，再三的签字，以为就常情来说，就普通为人的道德来说，总应该是当真了，是算数了，难道甚至连这样郑重签字所允许的东西都不可靠么？美国政府如果以后还要与中国人民有什么来往，而不是想从此以后永无来往，至少也应该守它签字的信用吧！中国人民这样想是毫不奇怪的，因为依照常理，这是正当的想法，因此中国人民就以为和平到来了，民主有望了，谁知道美国的帝国主义分子们所要的并不是什么信用，他要的只是中国人民失掉警觉性，因而对于反动派的袭击没有准备。为此目的甚至丧失做人的基本条件，以后无须与中国人民来往也在所不惜。美国的帝国主义者用这样想法的，十足把中国人民变得失掉警觉性，同时充分帮助蒋介石使之能乘中国人民不防备的时候，以一个打击把中国人民打倒在地下。只要办到这件事，以后当然就无须再与中国人民有什么来往了。所以美国的帝国主义者，一面装起笑脸，大大的欺骗中国人民，另一面鼓足杀气，大大的给蒋介石以帮助，一切一切都是为了在一个打击之下把中国人民打倒。这就是美国的帝国主义者的狠毒计划。至于蒋介石的欺骗手段与其屠杀方法相互为用，以图达到上述美国帝国主义分子的同一目的——消灭中国人民力量。中国人民经验较多，警戒较深，这就不用多说了。
    同时，我们要再度强调美国的帝国主义者和蒋介石的力量是并不可怕的，蒋介石发动这次全面内战，并预计三个月至五个月就可以“消灭共产党”，他是根据他的力量来做这个估计的。他的力量在那里，在于美国四十万万美金的武器物资和借款，在于他三四年消极抗战中的积蓄，在于他的一百五十万嫡系军队，在于他所“收编”的七八十万伪军，在于他所“接收”的五十万亿元的日本武器财产工厂仓库和粮食。蒋介石的这些力量，在此次战争中被用来孤注一掷，但是仅仅打了五个月就差不多用完了。反动派不是没有力量，但因为它本身已在腐烂透了，有了这些庞大的物资和军力也并不顶事。从七月起的五个月已经过去了，蒋介石现在再计划五个月的作战，据说他要在今后五个月内消灭人民解放军。这是蒋介石的打算，但在人民解放军方面看来，过去五个月能够消灭蒋军三十九个旅，难道今后五个月就不能消灭大体上同样数目的蒋军吗？人民解放军战士他们是能够的。
    我们还要估计到在蒋介石的力量耗尽了的时候，美国的帝国主义们还有可能再帮他一手，例如已在商议中的美国五万万美金作为借款，例如美蒋商定以日本军人来做蒋军指挥官等等。但是这些比起从前的来将是更加不顶事的了。
    随着战场上我军的开始转入主动，蒋介石的军事危机是确切地到来了，而其政治危机也就可能到来。这时候中国人民应该怎样行动呢？应该采取坚决的行动，争取主动，在可以反攻的地方坚决反攻，在应当准备反攻的地方坚决准备反攻，在应当恢复力量的地方积极恢复力量，在应当准备力量的地方以适合于当前环境的方法积聚力量，在蒋军还要冒险进攻的地方更大胆的在消灭其进犯军之后，尽力转入反攻。
    在作战上，过去几个月我们许多兵团学会了打运动战及打据点，有些地方还没有学会的应赶快学会，分散兵力处处防御的作风是不好的，应当集中兵力歼灭敌人有生力量，须知蒋介石进犯军是应当大量歼灭与可以大量歼灭的。因此，我们主要的是靠打运动战歼灭敌人，争取战争的胜利，游击战在许多地方必须要发展，并在整个战争中具有重大的作用，但对于整个战局说来，它是辅助的方面。今天我们一方面不要轻敌，每次作战都应事先有充分准备，另方面又不可过高估计敌人，过低估计自己。除某些区域在敌我力量对比上须要我军以运动战为辅为有利或以二者并重为有利之外，其他地方均应力求集中兵力，以连续数昼夜顽强战斗的方法去歼灭敌人。
    最近几月作战中的有用经验之一，就是大踏步的转移的运动战，鄄城之战和滑县之战是很好的范例。另一个经验就是以攻为守，例如以吕梁作战来保卫陕甘宁边区和太岳解放区。这些新的经验须在适当的情况下大量运用，去彻底粉碎蒋介石的进攻，收复一切失地，毫不动摇的为恢复一月十三日位置与政治协商会议的路线而奋斗。
