　　【Report from Changzhi by this newspaper】Yushe's wool weaving movement has historically had a good foundation, and its development is even more widespread in winter production. More than 20 villages, including Xiache, Xishan, Xiaodu Yugou, Sanzhuang, Geta, Yunzu, Xiangyang, Nancun, and Taoyang, are almost all spinning wool and knitting sweaters. In the town of Yunzu, on market days, wool products can be seen everywhere. Some people are knitting sweaters while doing business. Even during meetings, they bring their yarn and knit sweaters while attending the meeting. Some people even knit various wool products while walking. Currently, one jin of wool costs 150 yuan, and it costs 30 yuan to card one jin. A person can typically spin two jin of wool a day, producing 1.4 jin of yarn. At the current yarn price, each jin sells for 800 yuan, so 1.4 jin can sell for 1,000 yuan. After deducting the cost of buying wool and carding, which is 360 yuan, a person can make a profit of 640 yuan per day just by selling yarn. If it is woven into finished products, two jin of yarn can be woven into a sweater in one day, which can sell for nearly 3,000 yuan. In two days, a person can earn more than 2,000 yuan. After the autumn harvest this year, 163 of the 179 households in Taoyang village were involved in this movement. Some entire families participated, while others had one person participating. In one month, they carded and spun a total of 850 jin of wool, knitted 600 vests, and 650 sweaters, earning a total profit of 2,492,950 yuan. Xiao Erku of the village originally used two jin of wool. His family of five carded more than 200 jin of wool, earning 40,000 yuan, spun 50 jin of wool, earning 5,000 yuan, and made 45 finished products, earning 50,000 yuan. In total, they earned 120,000 yuan in two months. Another household had all six family members participating in this movement. The whole family organized a group, with one person responsible for buying raw materials and selling finished products, and five people at home responsible for carding, spinning, and knitting. They can complete four sweaters a day, and the whole family can earn 3,200 yuan a day. In two months, they earned 100,000 yuan. A thirteen-year-old daughter, Hao Liuxian, knitted thirteen vests in fifty days, mainly during her spare time from studying, earning money to buy 43 jin of wheat flour, worth more than 17,000 yuan. A seven-year-old girl, Hao Qiaoxian, earned 3,200 yuan by knitting vests.

    In Yangquanling Natural Village, more than ten households, led by sixteen women under the leadership of Lao Ying and Shi Juhua, spun 300 jin of wool in one month, earning 24,000 yuan. Xiaodu Yugou organized 150 women from the whole village to spin wool for five days, earning 76,000 yuan, and spun 1,000 jin of wool in twenty days, earning 300,000 yuan. In Xiache Natural Village, 134 women in 24 groups spun 1,000 jin of wool in six days, earning 80,000 yuan. Each person can spin up to three jin of wool a day, and children can also spin one jin a day.
