　　Model Medic Liang Yanbin
　　Wang Ruo
　　Comrade Liang Yanbin is a medic in the machine gun company of the third squad of the 3326th Unit. He is only seventeen years old this year, and not very tall, but he is smart and lively, truly like a little rubber ball. Speaking of his past experiences, this young brother's story is indeed very painful and tragic. He is from Wuyang County, Henan Province, and attended school for a year. When he was twelve years old, his family went bankrupt and could not make a living, so he followed an uncle to join the army. At thirteen, his father unfortunately died. He received a letter from home and cried bitterly. He managed to get leave to return home to bury his father, but near Luoyang, he was seized by Shanxi troops recruiting soldiers, who refused to let him leave and tore up his travel permit. Later, he was put on a train to Shanxi. Just after crossing the Yellow River, they encountered a Japanese attack and he was captured by the Japanese. A Japanese translator wanted him to be a orderly, but he refused and was sent to a coal mine in Lingshi County to do hard labor for more than seven months, enduring untold hardships. He then escaped with several captured Jin-Sui soldiers, but in the mountains of Yan Xishan's area, the Yan army still refused to let him return home, keeping him to serve as a soldier. It wasn't until last year's Shangdang Campaign at Mopan'nao that he was liberated by our army. He volunteered to join the Eighth Route Army as a medic. Although Liang Yanbin has been a medic for less than a year, he has made many contributions to battlefield rescue work. During the Chenlong blocking battle, the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, but he still went back and forth in the field to rescue the wounded. When his first-aid kit was used up, he tore up his own quilt to use as bandages. In the Shao'erzhai battle, he rescued the wounded in the open, only a hundred meters or so from the enemy, saving thirty or forty wounded, and he was "always responsive" and "available whenever called." Among those he rescued were members of his own third squad as well as other units. He deeply understands that rescuing wounded soldiers early on the battlefield, reducing blood loss, can save lives. He rescues the wounded even in the most dangerous situations.
　　Whenever wounded comrades mention "Little Rubber Ball," they all praise him in unison, saying, "His actions are light and quick when stopping bleeding and changing dressings, reducing the pain of the wounded." Therefore, everyone likes him to change their dressings. He usually carries more first-aid supplies than other medics, and he changes dressings for the most wounded soldiers in each battle. The soldiers of the third squad are all proud and say, "Don't underestimate our little medic, he does more work than three people combined!" In this election of heroes, he received a total of fifty-two votes, making him the top hero model in the entire squad.

　　模范卫生员梁炎滨
    王若
    梁炎滨同志是三三二六部队三小队机炮连卫生员，今年才十七岁，长的也不高，但聪明活泼，真像个小皮球。这位小兄弟，说起他从前的遭遇确是很痛苦很悲惨的，他是河南舞阳县人，上过一年学，十二岁时家庭破产无法生活，就跟随一位叔叔当兵，十三岁不幸父亲死了，他接到家信哭的死去活来，好容易挂了号回家葬埋父亲，谁料到洛阳附近又被山西队伍抓兵的扣住不叫走，把路条也撕了。以后被押上火车往山西送，刚过了黄河，遇到日本人进攻，又被日本人俘虏去，日本翻译官要他当勤务兵，他不愿干，被送到灵石县煤窑里做了七个多月苦工，受不了说不尽的苦楚，他便随着几个晋绥军俘虏一起逃跑，到阎锡山区里，阎军依然不叫他回家，留下当兵，直至去年上党战役打磨盘垴才为我军解放过来，他自愿参加八路军，当卫生员。梁炎滨虽然当卫生员还不到一年，但他对战场救护工作有很多贡献；陈隆阻击战时，敌人炮火打的很凶，他仍在野地里来回救护彩号，救急包用完了，他就把自己被子撕了当绷带用；邵耳寨战斗，白天他在离敌人百十米达的开阔地上抢彩号，先后救下了三四十个伤员，并且是“有求必应”，“随叫随到”。在他抢救的彩号里有他们三小队的，也有旁的部队的。他深切懂得战场上早一点救护，伤员少流血，就能多救活一条命。”并且在最危险的情况下，抢救彩号。
    伤员同志，每当提起“小皮球”，都异口同声地夸奖说：“他止血换药时，动作又轻巧，又快，减少彩号痛苦。”因此大家都喜欢他来换药。他平时背的急救包比别的卫生员多，每次战斗中，他替伤员换药也最多，三小队战士们都引以为荣的说：“不要看咱卫生员人小，做工作他一个比三个人做的还多哩！”这次选举英雄，他共得五十二票，是全小队英雄模范中头一名。
