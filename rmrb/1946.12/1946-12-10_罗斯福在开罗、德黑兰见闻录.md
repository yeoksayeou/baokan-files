　　Roosevelt's Encounters in Cairo and Tehran
　　Translated by Yu Caijie

　　Editor's Note: This is an excerpt from "Roosevelt's Memoirs" by Elliott Roosevelt, son of the late U.S. President Roosevelt. It is a valuable piece of modern historical material. From it, you can read about Stalin's greatness, Chiang Kai-shek's baseness, and Churchill's rascality. Unfortunately, the original work is too long, so we can only excerpt parts. This section will be continued in the next issue.
　　　　　　　
  　The Beginning of the Cairo Conference

　　Eleven months after the Casablanca Conference, my father and Churchill finally arranged the long-desired meeting with Stalin.

　　This was in November 1943. I received secret notice to meet with "a certain important person." Father had told me earlier that there would be two meetings, one with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo, and another with Stalin in Tehran. Chiang and Stalin could not meet at the same time because Russia had not yet declared war on Japan. When I arrived in Cairo, Father, Churchill, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and Madame Chiang were already there. Two meetings had already been held jointly with the Allied chiefs of staff.

　　Chiang's Banquet

　　So I attended Chiang's cocktail party to attend to my father. Churchill's daughter, Sarah, had the same duty for her father. But I didn't get a chance to speak to her. Madame Chiang came to my side almost immediately, leading me to two armchairs.

　　She made me feel like an actor. She leaned forward, looking at me brightly, agreeing with everything I said, and earnestly placing her hand on my knee. ... I believe her charming allure and carefully crafted concern for people had become second nature. ...

　　The Generalissimo did not speak English. I could only exchange some pleasantries through an interpreter. ...

　　Later, Father told me: "...China must continue to fight to contain Japanese forces. And who can replace Chiang's position? We can only rely on the Chiang family and all their shortcomings together."…

　　At the same time, various meetings were taking place, and the British were still nitpicking at the weaknesses of the "Cross-Channel Attack" plan. The Americans insisted on the original plan, refuting various objections to attacks on Norway and the Mediterranean.

  　Far East Issues

　　One evening, Father and I were chatting and smoking before saying "goodnight." He told me about China's position. He said the British even opposed our strategy in the Pacific theater. "They don't approve of our island-hopping offensive." "They don't understand that we want to use the Philippines as a future base." He smiled wearily and said, "Perhaps the British can't appreciate the Filipinos rallying under our flag, just as they don't want their colonial peoples under their flag. Their opinion is that we should abandon the island-hopping offensive and concentrate on clearing the Malay Peninsula, and then climb up the Chinese coast to establish a base."

　　Father told me that landing on the Chinese coast was under consideration, "but much further north than the British imagined." He said, "Our intelligence gives us a different picture from the British. They only know that the Chinese coast is disturbed by the Japanese. But we are very aware that most of the coast is in the hands of Chinese guerrillas." I asked if these guerrillas were Chinese Communist troops, and he nodded affirmatively. "Chiang wants us to believe that the Chinese Communists have never fought against Japan. But what I know is not true."

　　I mentioned that I heard our aerial reconnaissance and aviation maps of China were being strictly kept secret from the British. He said, "We had discussed it with the Chinese long ago. The Chinese wanted us to promise not to give the aviation maps to the British. It's not hard to understand their point of view. ... Naturally, they also need our support to get Britain out of Hong Kong and Guangdong, and to abandon extraterritorial rights."

　　I asked if we supported Chiang. "Not unconditionally," he said. "I have explained the nature of Chiang's government. I told him it couldn't be considered a modern democracy. I told him that while the war was going on, he should form a coalition government with the Yan'an Communist organization. He agreed, on the condition that he receive our guarantee that the Soviet Union would respect the Manchurian border. This issue has been placed on the agenda of the Tehran Conference. On the other hand, we support his request to "have Britain and other countries no longer enjoy imperial privileges in China."

　　"It won't be easy to get Churchill to agree to this," I observed.

　　"There won't be much argument," Father said sharply, "because ninety percent of American supplies and American personnel are being used to defeat Japan…"

　Uncle Joe Makes a Deep Impression

　　I stayed in Cairo for two days. When I arrived in Tehran, Father had already spoken with Stalin and Molotov. The first meeting of Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill had also taken place.

　　"What is he like, Dad?" I asked.

　　"Uncle Joe!" he only called Stalin that in private, "Oh, he is dignified, speaks very cautiously, seems very confident, very sure of himself, moves slowly—all in all, he makes a deep impression." "The first time it was just me and Uncle Joe and his interpreter."

　　"Do you like him?"

　　He nodded emphatically and smiled, saying, "Stalin saw our plan for the cross-channel attack. He watched, asked a question or two, and then asked: "When?" I am confident that Stalin and I will work out a result together. Many past misunderstandings and distrust should be cleared up in these few days – we will clear them up forever. As for Uncle Joe and Winston Churchill…"

　　"It won't be that good."

　　"My job will be between the two of them. They are so different. ..." He then mentioned the post-war world peace, and the cooperation of the three powers to maintain peace. Any peace must have these countries working in a unified posture. If only one of them takes a negative attitude, it can veto the entire proposition. He said that this veto power had not been fully discussed, but in general, he agreed that the continued strong unity of the three powers in the future was a principle necessity. … (To be continued)

　　罗斯福在开罗、德黑兰见闻录
    余才节译
    编者按：这是美国故总统罗斯福的儿子伊利奥德·罗斯福所著罗斯福见闻录中的一段，是一节珍贵现代史料，从这里你可读到斯大林的伟大，蒋介石的卑鄙，邱吉尔的无赖。可惜原著太长，我们只能节摘。这一部分下期可以续完
　　　　        
  　开罗会议之始
    卡萨勃朗卡会议后十一个月，父亲和邱吉尔最后才安排了久欲举行的和斯大林会晤。
    这是一九四三年十一月，我得到了秘密通知去会见“某要人”。父亲早曾告诉我得有两个会谈，一个和蒋介石委员长，在开罗；另一个和斯大林，在德黑兰。蒋和斯大林不能同时会晤，因为俄国尚未对日作战。我到开罗时，父亲、邱吉尔、蒋委员长和蒋夫人都已经在那儿了。两次会议已经和联军参谋们共同举行过。
　  蒋氏的宴会
    于是我为了侍候父亲而参加蒋氏的鸡尾酒会。邱吉尔的女儿撒拉，也对她父亲有同样的职务。不过我没有机会和她讲话。蒋夫人到我一边来，几乎是即刻地，带我到两个椅座去。
    她使我感到像个演员。她向前倾侧着，对我明亮地注视着，同意我所说的一切，着实地把她的手放在我的膝盖上。…………我相信她引人的妩媚和巧装对待人的关心已成为第二天性。…………
    委员长不讲英语。我只能借翻译员交换了一些寒暄。…………
    后来父亲对我说：“…………中国必须继续作战以牵制日本兵力。而且谁能代替蒋的地位呢？我们只有依赖蒋氏和他们所有的缺点在一起。”……
    同时各种会议在进行中，英国人仍在挑剔“渡峡攻欧”计划的弱点。美国人坚持着原计划，推翻着向挪威地中海进攻的各种异议。
  　远东问题
    一天晚上，父亲和我在道“晚安”前抽烟闲叙。他告诉我一些中国的地位。他说英国人甚至反对我们在太平洋战区的战略。“他们不赞成我们越岛进攻。”“他们不明了我们想用菲律宾作将来基地”。他乏味地微笑说，“或者英国人不能欣赏菲人集结在我们的旗帜下，正像他们不愿他们的殖民地人民在他们的旗帜下一样。他们的意见是我们该放弃越岛进攻，而该集中力量扫清马来半岛，然后爬上中国海岸，建立一个基地。”
    父亲告诉我在中国沿海登陆是在计议中，“但远较英国人所想像的为在北方。”他说，“我们的情报给我们的图景不同于英国人的。他们只知道中国海岸被日本扰乱着。而我们很警惕于大部海岸是在中国游击队手内。”我问这些游击队是否为中国共产党的军队，他肯定地点点头。“蒋氏想要我们相信中国共产党是不曾抗日作战过。而我所知道的却不然”。
    我提到我听说我们在中国的空中侦察和航空地图是严格地对英保守秘密的。他说，“我们早就和中国人商量定了。中国人要我们答应不把航空地图给英国。不难了解他们的观点。…………自然，他们也需要我们支持，使英国退出香港和广东，放弃治外法权。”
    我问我们是否支持蒋氏。“并不是无所谓地，”他说：“我已诉说过蒋氏的政府的性质。我告诉他这不能算是近代民主政治的。我告诉他该当战争在进行时，和延安共产党组织联合政府。他同意了，条件是他得到我们保证苏联尊重满洲边界。这问题已放在德黑兰会议程上。在另一方面，我们支持他的请求“让英国和别的国家不再在华享有帝国特权。”
    “要邱吉尔同意这一点是不容易的。”我观察着说。
    “这不会有多少争论的”，父亲尖锐地说：“因为有百分之九十的美国物资和美国人在用于战败日本哩…………。”
　约瑟叔叔使人印象深刻
    我在开罗延迟了两天，到德黑兰时，父亲已和史大林及莫洛托夫谈话过了。罗、史、邱第一次会谈也过了。
    “他是怎样的？爸爸。”我问。
    “约瑟叔叔！”他只在私下这样称呼史大林，“喔，他是庄重的，谈吐很审慎，似乎很有把握，很确信自己，动作得缓慢——合起来说使人印象深刻的。”“第一次只是我和约瑟叔叔和他的翻译员。”
    “你喜欢他吗？”
    他着重地点头肯定，并且笑着说：“史大林看到我们渡峡攻欧的计划。他注视着，问了一两个问题后，只问：“什么时候？”我确信我们，史大林和我一同将打一个结果出来。以往许多误会和不信任，应在这几天内清除掉——我们永远清除掉，至于约瑟叔叔和文斯登邱吉尔之间呢……………”
    “不这样好吧。”
    “我的工作将是他们两者之间。他们是那样的不相同。……”他于是提到战后世界和平，三强的合作保持和平。任何和平必需这些国家在统一姿态上工作，只需其中一个国家采取否定态度，便可否决整个命题。他说这否决权尚未充分讨论，但一般说，他赞成三强未来继续牢固团结是原则上必需的。……（未完）
