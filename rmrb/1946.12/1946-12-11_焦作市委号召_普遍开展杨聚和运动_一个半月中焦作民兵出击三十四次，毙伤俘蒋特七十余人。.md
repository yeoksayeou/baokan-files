    Universal Launch of the Yang Juhe Movement
    In a Month and a Half, Jiaozuo Militia Launched 34 Attacks, Killing, Wounding, and Capturing Over 70 Chiang Kai-shek Special Agents.
    [This newspaper's Jiaozuo dispatch] Under the banner of Yang Juhe, the Jiaozuo militia armed work teams have launched a total of 34 attacks in a month and a half (October 11th to November 24th).

In total, brilliant results have been achieved in the past month and a half: 36 enemies killed or wounded, 14 enemies captured, more than 20 returning special agents captured, 2 strongholds taken, 9 pillboxes destroyed, 11 captured masses liberated, 11 rifles and pistols seized, 42 head of livestock seized, and many telephones and military supplies seized.

    [Jiaozuo dispatch] On the 27th of last month, the Jiaozuo Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of all district political and civilian cadres to summarize and examine the patriotic self-defense guerrilla warfare of the past month and a half. Countless heroes and models emerged, opening up the situation of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and further enhancing the confidence and courage to persist in the victory of the war. Comrade An Lifu of the Jiaozuo Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: In the guerrilla warfare during the more than 40 days of retreat in Jiaozuo, great achievements have been made, and a large number of heroic figures like Comrade Yang Juhe have emerged. Under their leadership, the struggle in Jiaozuo was persisted in, and the interests of the masses were protected. He called for: universally launching the Yang Juhe movement, performing meritorious service for the people, and launching a killing-the-enemy competition.
