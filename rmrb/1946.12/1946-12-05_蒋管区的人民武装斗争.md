　　The people in the Chiang-controlled areas, unable to endure the tyranny of the Chiang family, have risen up in armed struggle. The following is a summary of the development of the people's uprisings and armed forces in various regions over the past few months:

　　The most powerful base for people's armed forces in the Jiangnan region is Taihu Lake. There, there are more than 7,000 members of the uprising forces equipped with modern equipment such as submachine guns, rocket launchers, and mortars. They have raised the banner of the "Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army." In addition to controlling the entire Taihu Lake navigation route, they frequently appear on the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai)-Hangzhou railway line, and in Suzhou, Wuxi, Wuhing, and the vast Su (Jiangsu) province region northwest of Taihu Lake. They have also established local political power in the Danshan area within Wuxi,展开开展 propaganda against Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and from time to time carry out road destruction and ambush military vehicles in Furong Mountain, Jiaoshan Mountain, and Yangting between Wuxi and Suzhou.

　　In Dinghai County of the Zhoushan Islands, an armed uprising of the people also took place in July. In the coastal area from Taizhou to Dinghai, fishermen and farmers, due to being exploited by corrupt officials, abandoned large tracts of cultivated land and fishing boats and organized armed forces to "make a living at sea." The Ningbo gang led by Zhang Zhiguan alone possessed more than a hundred ships. They shouted the slogan "Eliminate corrupt officials" and seized smuggling ships that were both official and commercial, sucking the fat of the people. In fierce battles with the Chiang family navy, they captured many new weapons and equipment. This people's armed force is developing and growing rapidly, and now numbers 4,000.

　　In the Siming Mountain area of ​​Yinxi, including Yuyao, Ningbo, Shengxian and other seven counties, after the withdrawal of the New Fourth Army's Zhejiang East Column, Chiang Kai-shek carried out two "cleansing campaigns," raping, killing, burning, and looting everywhere. The peasants could no longer bear it, and once again took up arms to defend their hometowns. In Liangnong Shipa, Cixi County, for example, an armed force of several thousand people was developed.

　　In the Yandang Mountain area on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian, the Kuomintang government carried out several massacres of the people, arousing popular uprisings in vast areas. The armed forces active in Pingyang and Taixing have joined forces with some armed forces in Fujian to carry out guerrilla warfare "anti-encirclement" day and night.

　　The Guangdong people's armed forces have spread throughout the southwest, west, north and south vast areas of the province. In the Shiwan Mountain area near Qinzhou on the southwest border of Guangdong and Guangxi, there are two civil armies with more than 2,000 people, one is the "Fangcheng Detachment" organized by the youth of Fangcheng last spring to resist Japanese寇 (Japanese aggression), and the other is the "South Road Liberation Army" established by General Zhang Yan. In the vast area north of the West River in western Guangdong, including Guangning, Deqing, and Sihui, there is the "West River People's Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army" formed by Guangning educated youth and farmers. The team was established in January last year, and after the war, it smashed more than 100 large and small offensives by the Chiang army, and advised landlords to appropriately reduce rent and interest to launch disaster relief, etc.; deeply loved by local farmers and landlords. In Hainan Island, there is a fishing people's armed force with growing momentum. Since the 46th Division of the Kuomintang regular army in the area was投入 put into the civil war, the people's armed forces have become more active. The island has become a world of people's armed activities, and roads and bridges have been destroyed. In addition, there is the "Relief Army" on the south bank of the East River, the "Five Dragons Hall" in the Pearl River Delta, a people's armed force in the Leizhou Peninsula, and a people's armed force on the border between northern Guangdong and Hunan Province.

　　The armed resistance of Hunan peasants has spread to counties in southern Hunan, western Hunan, and eastern Hunan. The people of Chen County, Yongxing, and Guiyang counties in Hunan were forced by the Kuomintang's tyranny and rose up to form a "Poor People's Corps" of tens of thousands of people. Recently, the "Poor People's Corps" has expanded to Guidong, Rucheng, Qitianling on the border of Hunan and Guangdong, and Longhuguan on the border of Hunan and Guangxi. Thousands more people from various places continue to participate.

　　The people's army in western Hunan, led by Zhai Bogai and Peng Chunrong, possessed more than 2,000 rifles and more than 30 machine guns, raising the banner of the "Commander of the Guerrilla Force on the Border of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan and Hubei," active in Dayong, Yongshun, Sangzhi and other counties. Taking Bamian Mountain as its base, they galloped across Hefeng in Hubei, Longshan, Laifeng, and Youyang on the border of Hunan and Sichuan.

　　The people's armed uprisings in Yunnan, forced to rise up against the tyranny of the Chiang family, number at least 14,000 to 15,000. The people's armed forces in western Yunnan alone are more than 10,000. This unit is a Miao Yi armed force, one of the Yi ethnic groups, which is fierce and good at fighting. The leaders are Yu Linhuaihaiqing, Hu Laka, and Yang Adu, active in the Yunling Mountains near Yongteng. In Sier District, there are still several units such as Gao Cailie and Gao Ruyun, all with complete firearms.

　　The people's armed forces in the eastern Yunnan area number approximately over 2,000. In addition to Tao Yongzhong, who can summon more than a thousand people at any time, there are also Zhao Huanran, An Bangdu (Manchu armed forces), and Wei Guangxing.

　　In southern Yunnan, there are He Guangrong, Luo Riyao, Long Yonghe, and Xu Si Laoban, with a total of about 1,400 people. In addition, the Yi-Han people's uprising armed force led by Lu Tiqi in Qiaojia County, northern Yunnan, also has more than a thousand people.

　　People's uprisings in Sichuan have spread throughout the province. The people's armed uprisings in more than 20 counties in eastern Sichuan, including Wusheng, Hechuan, Pengshui, Wushan, Chengkou, Daxian, and Quxian, are expanding day by day, with many poor peasants participating. Now it has developed to 8,000 to 10,000 people with weapons. Among them, the peasant armed forces of two to three thousand people in Linshui, Yuechi and other places take Huaying Mountain (namely the Dongyue Mountain Range) as their base. Another people's armed force of over 700 people from Changshou, Wusheng and other seven counties also take the mountain as its base.

　　On the southern Sichuan and Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou borders: Gu蔺, Qijiang, Dazu, Longchang, Mabian, Leibo, Junlian, and nearly 30 counties in Weiyi and Zhenxiong in Yunnan have the footprints of civil uprising vehicles. There are more than 5,000 people with weapons in total. The leaders include Chen Dianze and Lao Mushi Du (Yi ethnic armed forces). They possess weapons such as mortars and machine guns, and展開展开 resistance to the Chiang regime through various organizational forms and methods of struggle.

　　On the western Sichuan and Sichuan-Xikang border, since the Kuomintang massacred 200,000 Yi people in Tianquan and Rongjing this spring, the people's uprising has become a prairie fire. In the entire western Sichuan area, as far as has been discovered, there are a total of 4,000 to 5,000 people scattered in 26 or 27 counties including Zhongjiang, Lifan, Dayi, Jingyan, and Jintang.

　　The uprising civilians in Tongjiang, Nanbu, Bazhong and other areas in the northern Sichuan area, which rose up in May, have occupied most of the towns and villages in the area. Now the civil uprising continues to expand and has spread to 20 counties including Mianzhu and Songpan. In total, there are approximately over 100,000 people with weapons in northern Sichuan. Most of the insurgents are peasants and veterans. Their 50,000 troops take Nanjiang, Wangcang, and Guangyuan as their bases, possessing vast hundreds of miles of undeveloped forest areas.

　　The people's armed forces in various parts of Shaanxi have about 6,000 people, and their activity areas reach more than 20 counties. Among them, southern Shaanxi has the greatest momentum. The "Shangluo Guerrilla Headquarters" was established in villages and towns in Shanyang County, with Gong Defang and Wang Lie as the commander and deputy commander. The unit, with 4,700 people, is active in vast villages and towns in eight counties including Luonan and Lantian, and has established bases in Shanyang and Shang County.
