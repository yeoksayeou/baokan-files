    Launch New Year's Support-the-Army Activities
    [Reported by our newspaper from Hebei, Shandong and Henan on the 29th] As the end of the year approaches, various parts of Hebei, Shandong and Henan are enthusiastically launching New Year's saving and support-the-army movements. All teachers and students of the Jian'guo Academy donated money to support the army, raising a total of 120,000 yuan in three days. A 14-year-old junior correspondent also donated 1,000 yuan saved over half a year. All cadres and miscellaneous personnel of the Hexi County Government saved their winter clothing allowances for this winter to support the army, and launched a challenge competition. Comrade Zhang Jiefu, a correspondent, donated all of his reissued winter clothing allowance. He said, "My coat is patched and mended. The winter clothing allowance should go to the soldiers at the front to kill more Chiang Kai-shek bandits." Among the 115 cadres and miscellaneous personnel in the county government, 84 donated their entire winter clothing allowance, and the other 31 partially donated money, totaling more than 308,000 yuan. The Hebei, Shandong and Henan Postal Workers' Union launched a movement to save one tael of rice per person per day before the Gregorian New Year to support the army. The Postal District Bureau Staff Union, all staff responded to the support-the-army competition. Some donated all their savings for the year. The District Bureau Staff Union alone donated a total of 460 jin of millet in one day. The primary schools in Hexi County responded to the New Year's support-the-army effort by launching a spare-time firewood gathering movement to support the army. Every day from 4:00 to 5:00 pm after school, they gathered firewood for two weeks, collecting a total of 3,280 jin of firewood, which was sold for 33,000 yuan, all of which was donated to support the army.
