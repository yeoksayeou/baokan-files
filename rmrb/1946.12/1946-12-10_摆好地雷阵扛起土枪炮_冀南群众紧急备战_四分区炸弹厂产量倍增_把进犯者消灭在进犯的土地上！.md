　　【Benbao Weixian Eighth Electric】The entire Jinnan area is urgently preparing for war. The Fourth Military Sub-district has established an explosives training class to train explosive talent in the border areas. The first phase drew twenty-one militiamen and cadres from Ningnan, Baixiang, and Yaoshan to live with the sub-district's gun and bomb factory for experiments. The training method focuses on practice, and mistakes or impasses are immediately studied and guided. The trainees' enthusiasm is very high, and progress is rapid. After only fifteen days, they have all learned how to make hand grenades, mother-and-child mines, stone mines, iron mines, prepare black explosives, primer powder, fuse powder, quick-burning fuses, slow-burning fuses, and install electric ignition, foot-operated ignition, wire-pull ignition, and concealment methods. Everyone has made 240 hand grenades and dozens of mother-and-child mines, and the explosions were very good in the field test. They have now returned to their original locations, actively preparing explosives to set up minefields for the Chiang bandits. In order to widely carry out the explosives movement, the sub-district decided to organize the training of the second phase.

　　In addition, workers in the bomb factory of the military sub-district actively responded to the call of the Military Affairs Committee and proposed the slogan "Less rest, more work." Everyone's production enthusiasm is very high. The production of hand grenades in ten days has more than doubled the original output. The Fifth Military Sub-district has also successively convened hygiene and explosives training classes. The trainees in the hygiene training class are very enthusiastic and determined to learn basic medical knowledge to serve in the militia combat company.

　　【Lingdian】After Feixiang Tiantai Mountain was strafed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, the masses of the whole village, with unparalleled anger, threw themselves into intense war preparations to meet the invasion of the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Now, the village's Young Pioneers and Sisters' Corps check pedestrians during the day, and the farmers' association stands guard and patrols at night, while the militia patrols all night. Militia captain Xue Peide seized the opportunity to call on the masses to disperse and bury grain and valuables, and organized stretcher transport into squads and platoons, ready to attack at any time. The militiamen shouted in unison: "Resolutely protect our fruits of victory. Wherever the Central Army attacks, we will wipe them out there!"

　　【Youdian】When the emancipated peasants of Shijiazhuang, Linzhang, discussed in the farmers' association小组, they unanimously proposed to build iron factories to manufacture hand grenades and landmines, and at the same time mobilize to block street entrances, transform the village shape, and carry out war preparations. Now, with the direct help of the Military Affairs Committee, the village has found more than a dozen technicians, and tools and raw materials have been prepared. A large number of hand grenades and landmines will be produced soon. The masses are all eager to try, saying: "With landmines and hand grenades, we are not afraid of anything; if Old Chiang wants to attack, we will set up a minefield for him." The militiamen of Liguantun, Fourth District, Wucheng, under the call of the district Military Affairs Committee to organize joint defense and use a large number of homemade rifles and cannons, shouldered homemade rifles and patrolled, overcoming the view that simply using steel rifles was considered unattractive and useless. Militiaman Zhao Gangtao said: "Homemade rifles are also useful. In the past, we used homemade rifles to win battles against the '牵牛队' (referring to the puppet army); we have a lot of militiamen, and it is impossible for everyone to have steel rifles at once. Winning battles is not only about weapons, we should carry forward the glorious tradition of the eight-year war of resistance against Japan." With this enthusiasm to protect the interests of the masses, the entire village supported all the militiamen. Now they are creating more homemade rifles and cannons, ready to fight the Chiang bandits to the death and defend the elders and land of the whole village.

　　摆好地雷阵扛起土枪炮
    冀南群众紧急备战
  　四分区炸弹厂产量倍增
    把进犯者消灭在进犯的土地上！
    【本报威县八日电】冀南全区紧急备战。四分区成立爆炸训练班，训练边沿区爆炸人材。第一期抽调宁南、柏乡、尧山民兵及干部二十一人，与分会枪弹工厂住在一起，以便实验。训练方式着重实习，做错或做不通时就立时研究指导。学员情绪非常高涨，进度很快，经过短短的十五天，便都学会了制手榴弹、制子母雷、石雷、铁雷，配制黑炸药、底火药、捻子药、速燃捻、缓燃捻，装制电发火、脚踏火、线拉火和埋藏伪装等方法。大家已造成手榴弹二百四十枚，子母雷数十个，当场试验，爆炸很好。他们现已回到原地，积极准备爆炸物，准备给蒋贼摆地雷阵。分会为了普遍开展爆炸运动，决定第二期有组织的调训。
    又该分区炸弹厂工人积极响应武委会号召，提出“少息多做”的口号，各人生产情绪很高，十天的手榴弹生产，超过原产量一倍。五分区亦先后召开卫生、爆炸训练班。卫生训练班学员学习情绪很高，都有决心学好初步医药常识，到民兵战斗连中去服务。
    【另电】肥乡天台山遭蒋机扫射后，全村群众带着无比的愤怒，投入紧张的战争准备，以迎击蒋军的进犯。现该村白天由儿童团与姐妹团盘查行人，夜间由农会站岗放哨，民兵彻夜巡逻。民兵队长薛培德抓紧时机，号召群众将粮食及贵重物品分散埋藏，并把担架运输编成班排，随时准备出击。民兵一致喊出：“坚决保住咱们的胜利果实，中央军攻到那里，我们就消灭他在那里。”
    【又电】临漳史家庄翻身农民在农会小组讨论时，一致的提出建设铁工厂，制造手榴弹和地雷，同时动员堵街口，改造村形，进行战争准备。现该村在武委会直接帮助下，已找到十多位技术工人，工具原料已准备妥当，大批手榴弹、地雷不久即将造出。群众个个磨拳擦掌的说：“有了地雷手榴弹，啥也不怕；老蒋要来进攻，咱给他摆个地雷阵”。武城四区李官屯民兵，在区武委会组织联防，大量使用土枪土炮的号召下，扛起土枪，放哨巡逻，克服了单纯使用钢枪嫌土枪难看不顶事的观点。民兵赵港涛说：“土枪也管用，过去我们打牵牛队（指皇协军）时都是用土枪打了胜仗；我们民兵多得很，一时作不到人人都有钢枪，打胜仗不光在武器，我们应发扬八年抗日战争的光荣传统”。全体民兵在这种保护群众利益的热情下，得到全村群众的拥护。现他们正创造更多的土枪土炮，准传和老蒋拚命，保卫全村父老和土地。
