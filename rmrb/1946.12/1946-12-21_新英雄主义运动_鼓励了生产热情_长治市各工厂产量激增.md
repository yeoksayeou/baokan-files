　　New Heroism Movement
    Encouraged Production Enthusiasm
    Changzhi City Factories See Production Surge
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] After the City Model Workers Congress, production in various factories in this city has surged. After labor heroes like Lü Xizhu from Jingfang Coal Mine returned to the factory, they inspired the production enthusiasm of all the workers. In the past, three people per shift could produce at most five baskets of slag in four hours, but now they are producing nine baskets. Chang Jucai produces eleven baskets, and Chen Dougui produces fourteen baskets. Nandong originally required sixteen days to penetrate, but now it has been penetrated and coal has been seen in two days. The workers in Beidong are also working hard and will be able to penetrate it soon. After the hero of Xinhua Paper Mill, Wu Changhai, returned to the factory, he said to his fellow workers: "When the Yan army and the Japanese devils were in Changzhi last year, they rationed rotten rice to us workers, we couldn't get enough to eat, and we repaired bunkers in the rain, not caring about the lives of the workers; today the government regards us as top talents, it is really the glory of all of us!" Worker Jiang Dan said: "You go to the Model Workers Congress, and we will replace your work!" Regardless of the cold weather, snow, or strong winds, the workers insisted on drying paper, changing paper, cutting rope ends, watching the mill, taking care of the pot (hemp steaming pot), and washing raw materials, and insisted on completing one basket of paper every day. After the hero of the bomb factory, Li Hezhi, returned to the factory, he said to everyone: "Who cared about us workers in the past? This time I went to the meeting, and Mayor Yang even ate with us! We must all work harder and exceed the plan!" The next day, before the lights were on, he got up to install the iron smelting furnace. Under his influence, the production enthusiasm of all the workers in the sand turning department was greatly improved, and the workers went to work before dawn. Now the output has increased unprecedentedly, and Gao Xiuzhang drilled 1,500 holes overnight on the 26th. After the heroes of the Water Company, Hou Fuzhong, Yang Zangxi, etc., returned, they said to the workers: "The Model Workers Congress of our Taihang District has opened again. This is a happy event for our workers. We must step up our work to ensure the successful completion of the congress." Now all the workers are wiping machines, washing pipes, sweeping machine rooms, and ensuring that the heroes of the congress eat clean water. The Flour Department is processing wheat and grinding flour day and night, increasing voluntary labor by one hour to ensure that the congress eats top-quality flour.
