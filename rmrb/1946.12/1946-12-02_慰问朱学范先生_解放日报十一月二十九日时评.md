　　Condolences to Mr. Zhu Xuefan
  　Liberation Daily, November 29th Commentary
    The news arrived that Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in Hong Kong on the 25th. This is yet another most vile and shameless murder perpetrated by Chiang’s gang of secret agents, following those of Yang Xingfo, Shi Liangcai, Li Gongpu, and Wen Yiduo.
    Everyone knows that the Labor Association under Mr. Zhu Xuefan's leadership passed the famous twenty-three article progressive program, campaigned and appealed for the support of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and accepted the membership of the Liberated Area trade unions into the Labor Association, making it the broadest unified organization of workers in the country. During the Jiaochangkou bloodbath, Labor Association personnel stood with Chongqing democratic groups, engaging in fierce struggles against the secret agents. Precisely because of this, Zhu Xuefan and the Labor Association immediately became targets for Chiang Kai-shek’s government to suppress and persecute. Since February, the Shanghai and Tianjin branches of the Labor Association have been banned from operating. The Kuomintang Ministry of Social Affairs and even the party headquarters of various provinces and cities openly threatened "personnel adjustments" and "organizational dissolution." On August 6th, more than two hundred representatives from the "Chongqing General Labor Union," which was arranged by Chiang's gang of secret agents in Chongqing, along with military police and secret agents, armed and "took over" the Labor Association's Chongqing office and affiliated institutions such as the workers' welfare agency, labor hospital, nursery, workers' cultural service center, and art workshop. This incident aroused serious protests from the Chinese laboring people and trade unions worldwide. Under the pressure of Chinese and foreign public opinion, Chiang Kai-shek's government adopted two tactics: on the one hand, it was forced to release the Chongqing Labor Association personnel; on the other hand, it directly dispatched henchmen to seize the Labor Association, and falsely claimed the name of the Labor Association to make wild statements, singing praises of Chiang Kai-shek and defaming democracy in every possible way. The personal safety of Labor Association leader Zhu Xuefan was also threatened by secret agents.
    However, all these oppressive acts by Chiang Kai-shek's government did not stop the Labor Association and Mr. Zhu Xuefan's unyielding struggle for democracy, freedom, and workers' welfare. Upon arriving in Hong Kong this time, Mr. Zhu Xuefan publicly issued a solemn statement, exposing Chiang Kai-shek's government's constant attempts to destroy the labor movement, to destroy the unity of the labor community, to force the Labor Association to exclude the Liberated Area trade unions from its organization, and to force the Labor Association to openly oppose communism, "forcing me to participate in the undemocratic one-party National Assembly," and "fabricating charges to arrest me soon." Mr. Zhu clearly pointed out, "This one-party National Assembly, I will never recognize it as representing the wishes of the people of the whole country," and expressed that he himself will continue to strive unremittingly.
    Precisely because Mr. Zhu's statement represented the voice of the Chinese labor community and righteous people, and gained the attention and sympathy of Chinese and foreign public opinion; precisely because this statement hit the most painful spot of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, Chiang Kai-shek had no choice but to order his secret agent gang to commit this heinous act against Mr. Zhu. Mr. Zhu's assassination coincides with the time when Chiang's "National Assembly" is clamoring about what "constitutional draft" and babbling about its "fundamental law." This bloody scene on Queen's Road in Hong Kong is the most profound satire on Chiang's "National Assembly," and it clearly tells us that this "National Assembly" and its so-called "constitution-making" are nothing more than decorations of a dictatorial government.
    The assassination of Mr. Zhu Xuefan once again demonstrates the increasing isolation of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government. Mr. Zhu Xuefan is a prestigious figure in the Kuomintang. Because he has a sense of justice and advocates democracy, the rule of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families cannot but regard him as an enemy.
    We express our warmest respect for Mr. Zhu Xuefan's spirit of not fearing violence and unremittingly striving for democracy and workers' welfare. We are deeply concerned about his safety. Mr. Zhu Xuefan's blood will certainly not be shed in vain. The Chinese labor community and all righteous people will respond to the Chiang government's atrocities with great efforts to uphold Mr. Zhu's solemn statement.

　　慰问朱学范先生
  　解放日报十一月二十九日时评
    消息传来，中国劳动协会主席朱学范氏，于廿五日在香港被刺重伤，这就是杨杏佛、史量才、李公朴、闻一多以后又一次最卑鄙无耻的蒋帮特务杀人血案。
    谁都知道，在朱学范氏领导下的劳动协会曾通过了著名的二十三条进步纲领，曾经为支持政协决议奔走呼吁，曾经接受解放区工会加入劳协，使劳协成为全国工人最广大的统一组织。当较场口血案时，劳协人士曾与重庆民主团体站在一起，向特务作过激烈的斗争。正因为如此，所以朱学范与劳动协会就立即成为蒋介石政府摧残压迫的对象。二月以来，劳协上海天津分会被禁止活动，国民党社会部以至各省市党部公然以“调整人士”“解散组织”威胁。八月六日重庆的蒋帮特务包办的“重庆总工会”代表及军警特务二百余人，武装“接收”劳协驻渝办事处及附属之工人福利社、劳工医院、托儿所、工人文化服务社、美工堂等机构。这事件，引起全中国劳动人民与全世界职工会的严重抗议；在中外舆论压迫之下，蒋介石政府就来了两套办法：一方面被迫释放重庆劳协人员，另方面直接直派爪牙霸占劳协，并冒充劳协名义大放厥词，替蒋介石歌功颂德，诋毁民主，无所不至，劳协领袖朱学范氏的生命安全且受到特务的威胁。
    但是蒋介石政府这一切压迫行为，并没有阻止住劳协和朱学范氏为民主自由与工人福利的不屈不挠的斗争。朱学范氏这回到香港，就公开发表严正声明，揭露了蒋介石政府不断企图摧毁劳工，揭露了蒋介石政府不断企图摧毁劳工界之统一，强迫劳协排除解放区工会于其组织之外，并强迫劳协公开反共，“强迫本人参加非民主的一党国民大会”，以及“伪造罪名拟即将本人予以逮捕”朱氏明确地指出“比一党国大，本人决不承认其为能代表全国人民愿望”，并表示他本人仍将努力奋斗不懈。
    正因为朱氏这一声明代表中国劳工界和正义人士的呼声，获得中外舆论的重视和同情；正因为这个声明刺中了蒋介石统治最痛的地方，于是蒋介石就不得不命其特务匪帮对朱氏下此毒手。朱氏的被刺，正是蒋记“国大”叫嚣什么“宪草”瞎扯其“根本大法”的时候，香港皇后大道的这一幕血案，是对蒋记“国大”的最深刻的讽刺，它明白地告诉我们这个“国大”和其所谓“制宪”，无非是独裁政府的装饰品。
    朱学范氏的被刺，再次说明了蒋介石独裁政府的日趋孤立，朱学范氏是国民党里一位有声望的人物，因为他有正义感，主张民主，蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族的统治，就不能不把他当作敌人看待。
    我们对于朱学范先生为了民主与工人福利，不畏强暴，奋斗不懈的精神，谨致热烈的敬意。我们对他的安全，不胜遥念。朱学范先生的血决不是白流的，中国劳工界和一切正义人士将以很大的努力，拥护朱先生的严重声明来回答蒋政府的暴行。
