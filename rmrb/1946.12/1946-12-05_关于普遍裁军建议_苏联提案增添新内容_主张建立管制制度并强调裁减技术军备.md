　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Chenggong Lake News: The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has been discussing the Soviet proposal for universal disarmament since the 29th. After the Soviet representative stated the Soviet proposal, he added a clause on establishing a system of inspection and control for disarmament, and emphasized that disarmament should not only reduce personnel, but also reduce technical armaments, such as atomic weapons, rockets, etc., which should be included in the disarmament plan. The Soviet representative also proposed that two committees be established within the Security Council to control the implementation of disarmament decisions and to prevent the use of atomic energy for military purposes. Representatives from France, Denmark, Norway, the United States, Brazil, El Salvador, the United Kingdom, Belarus and other countries expressed their opinions at the meeting. Vyshinsky, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, thanked the representatives of those countries who supported the Soviet proposal in their speeches. At the meeting on the 30th, the French representative stated that the Soviet proposal should be used as a basis for discussion. Representatives from Poland, Yugoslavia, and other countries supported the Soviet proposal, and the Netherlands largely agreed. The British representative stated that he believed that the basic opinions between the Soviet Union and other countries were the same. He said that various rockets should be banned like atomic bombs, but the Security Council has the power of veto when it considers that dealing with disarmament issues is inappropriate.

　　关于普遍裁军建议
  　苏联提案增添新内容
  　主张建立管制制度并强调裁减技术军备
    【新华社延安二日电】成功湖讯：联大政治安全委员会自二十九日起，讨论苏联关于普遍裁军的建议。苏代表于申述苏联提案后，又添加建立关于裁军的视察与管制制度之条文，并强调裁军不仅裁减兵员，并须裁减技术军备，如原子武器、火箭等，应列入裁军计划之内。苏代表又主张在安全理事会内成立两委员会，以管制裁军决定之执行，并阻止原子能为军事目的之用。会上法国、丹麦、挪威、美国、巴西、萨尔瓦多、英国、白俄罗斯等国代表都发表了意见。维辛斯基代表苏联代表团向那些在发言中支持苏联建议的各国代表表示感谢。三十日会议上，法国代表发言时，认为苏联建议应作为讨论的基础。波兰、南斯拉夫等代表都支持苏建议，荷兰亦大体上同意，英代表表示相信苏联与其他国家间基本意见是相同的，他说，各种各样的火箭亦应如原子炸弹一样在被禁止之列，但安理会认为处理裁军问题不妥时，安理会有否决权。
