Letters from Home Reach the Soldiers
Ding Man Zhang Feng

During the victory at Hua-Pu, the ×× unit received twenty-five letters from home addressed to the soldiers in just one day. These letters were written by the soldiers' parents, brothers, and wives.

Look, this is a letter from Gao Fengtang of Gao Village, Fifth District, Yuan Dynasty, to his son, Gao Fubao: "Since you joined the army, the village has been very supportive of me, taking good care of me in all aspects. Our family has now been allocated two mu of orchard land, 60,000 yuan, a house, and a water vat... I hope my son will work with peace of mind at the front and resolutely kill the enemy... I am safe, don't worry about me." Gao Shuqi's mother wrote: "After our family turned over [became landowners after land reform], we got five mu of land and 50,000 yuan... Your mother is supported by the masses in the village. The family is safe and sound. I hope my son will fight more battles and win victories at the front."

When these affectionate letters from home reached the soldiers, everyone beamed and jumped for joy. Gao Fubao held the letter, reading it over and over again, happily slapping his thigh: "Now, my dad doesn't lack a son! The people in the village are taking better care of him than I did at home." Gao Shuqi was so happy that he spun around on the ground, muttering to himself, "I was worried about how my mother would manage, but now she has land and money, and all difficulties are solved."

Zhang Huaiqian also received a letter, but he didn't say a word, hiding in the corner to read it secretly. The brothers in his squad thought he had received some bad news. After a while, he burst out laughing. Everyone curiously gathered around, wanting to see his letter. He blushed and wouldn't show it to them. Everyone snatched it and read it aloud:

"Comrade Huaiqian: Your letter has been received. Our parents are doing well, don't worry about them. Our family has been allocated six mu of orchard land and 30,000 yuan. Our house is being repaired with the help of the village, and it can be finished before the New Year. Everything at home is taken care of by the village cadres. Your beloved, Li Xuelian. October 3rd of the lunar calendar."

Everyone burst into laughter, patting each other on the shoulders, saying: "Look, our hometown cadres and masses are really good, taking such good care of our fathers, mothers, and wives. If we don't fight a few good battles and capture a few more guns from old Jiang [Chiang Kai-shek], we'll really be letting them down!"

    家信到了战士手中
    丁曼  张风
    在这次滑濮之捷的当儿，××部队一天中就接到二十五封战士们的家信。这些信都是战士的父母、兄弟、妻子写来的。
    你看，这是元朝五区高庄高凤堂给他儿子福宝写的信：“你参军后，村上对我十分拥护，各方面都照顾得很周到。现咱家分得果实地二亩、洋六万元、房一所、水缸一口……望我儿在前方安心工作，坚决杀敌……老身平安，万勿挂念”。高书启的母亲来信说的是：“咱家翻身后，得到五亩地，洋五万元……你母亲在村上受群众拥护。家中老少平安。望我儿在前方多打胜仗。”
    这些亲切的家信到了战士们的手里，个个都眉笑颜开，乐的直蹦直跳。高福宝拿着信，读了一遍又一遍，高兴地拍着大腿：“这一下，我爹可不缺儿啦！村上的人比我在家里照顾得还好。”高书启喜的直在地上打转转，自言自语地说：“我原愁我娘没法过，现在有地有钱，啥困难也解决了。”
    张怀谦也接到信，却一个人不说话，躲在屋角里偷偷地读着。同班的弟兄们还以为他接到了什么不幸的消息。过了半天，他扑哧一下地笑出声来。大家都好奇地围拢去，要看他的信。他红着脸怎么也不给。大家抢过来一看，原来是张怀谦的爱人写来的。有人把信大声念起来：
    “怀谦同志：你的来信已经收到。咱父母都很好，你不要挂念。咱家分得果实地六亩、洋三万元。咱的房子由村上帮助修盖，年前可修起，家中一切有村干照顾。你的爱人李雪莲。古历十月三日”
    大家听得哈哈大笑，互相拍着肩膀说：“你看，咱家乡干部群众真不错，把咱们爹、妈、老婆照顾得多周到，不打几个漂亮仗，多缴老蒋几条枪，可真对不起他们！”
