    [This dispatch from Changzhi, dated the 6th] Under the relentless attacks day and night by our Anyang guerrilla groups and militia, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the area have been forced to switch from offense to defense. On the 28th of last month, County Magistrate Ma, Political Commissar He, and Director Xu personally led thousands of troops, launching a full-scale offensive against the enemy at night with the force of a raging tiger. They advanced along twelve routes deep into enemy territory, charging and smashing, inflicting damage on Chiang's troops and the "Homecoming Legions" everywhere. By the 6th, they had compressed them into points and lines. Shuiye is currently surrounded by our forces. The enemy and puppets are panicked, and morale is high. As of now, we have achieved remarkable results: (1) Recovered thirty-four villages and towns. (2) Engaged in one hundred and fifty-four battles, killing eighteen enemies, wounding fifty-three, capturing forty-eight, burning nineteen blockhouses, seizing eleven guns, one thousand two hundred rounds of ammunition, eight hundred and ten hand grenades, rescuing eighteen cadres, militia members, activists, and civilians from prisons, and recovering some of the livestock, grain, and clothing seized by landlords. Our army is currently expanding its gains while riding the wave of victory. (Wang Jian, Shi Hong)

    [This dispatch from Anyang] The Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in Shuiye are unable to sleep or rest due to the continuous attacks by our militia and guerrilla forces. On the night of the 28th of last month, Bu Qingming, a militia member from our Sixth District, carried a small cannon to Nanzi Shop to harass the enemy. Liu Renhou took the opportunity to enter the village alone and capture the puppet squad leader alive. At dawn on the 29th, our 52nd Unit ambushed the east of Ziyue Village, encountering seven members of the puppet Liu Leshan unit who were going to Zi Shop to demand supplies. We captured three of them alive without firing a single shot. On the night of the 28th, the Shuiye militia sneaked into Xiaodongguan, distributed propaganda materials, and posted county government notices on the city walls. On their return, they captured a member of the "Homecoming Legion" alive. When the deputy district chief of our Fifth District led a work team to operate in Fangshan, they threw two hand grenades. The Chiang's special agents and "Homecoming Legion" members thought they were surrounded and were extremely terrified, firing their rifles and machine guns blindly until we had retreated seven or eight li.

    Currently, the Chiang Kai-shek troops are in a state of panic under the continuous attacks by our militia and guerrilla forces, hiding in their shells and daring not venture out easily.
