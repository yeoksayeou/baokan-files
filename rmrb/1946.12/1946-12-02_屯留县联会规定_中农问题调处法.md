　　Tunliu County Federation Regulations:
    Methods for Mediating Middle Peasant Issues
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] In the past, during the mobilization of the masses in Tunliu, some cadres did not regard middle peasants as a fundamental part of the population. They were not allowed to participate in meetings, nor were they absorbed into peasant associations. In some places, middle peasants were even subjected to struggle sessions. This created anxiety among the middle peasants, leading to passive production and hindering the progress of the emancipation movement. After collecting opinions from the masses, the County Federation researched and developed several measures for mediating middle peasant issues: 1. Debt issues: All debts with completed procedures will no longer be pursued. Regardless of the amount of interest, if the interest exceeds the principal, the matter will be settled after clearing the procedures. If the interest is less than the principal or if no interest or principal has been paid, the principal or the remaining principal must be repaid. Those unable to repay at the time can repay in installments. 2. Loan relationships: If items borrowed in the past have not been returned and are now brought up, the matter will be settled by returning the amount borrowed or the item borrowed, without accruing interest. 3. Dispute resolution: If anyone took advantage of someone else in the past, and it is now brought up, only the original item can be returned or a token of "sincerity" offered. No interest accrual or "struggle" accounting is allowed. 4. Absorb middle peasants into peasant associations, lead middle peasants to speak out about their grievances, and give middle peasants a share of the fruits of victory. After these measures were announced at the thousand-person emancipation rally in the Third District, they were warmly supported by everyone. Xu Jianchang, a middle peasant from Su Village, said, "In the past, I was always waiting for people to come and struggle against me, so I didn't produce properly. Now I can rest assured." At the rally, middle peasants who had never spoken out before also spoke up continuously. (Yuebei People's Daily)
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi Dispatches] After ten days of investigation and rent reduction, Shipo Village in She County has achieved preliminary victory. Five landlord households have repaid the peasants' blood and sweat debts. The movement began with speaking bitterness and tracing the roots of poverty in the winter school, which raised the consciousness of the masses. First, a reasoned struggle was launched against the stubborn landlord Wang Hongfei. The masses listed the facts of his oppression and exploitation over the years one by one. Wang, finding himself weak and unreasonable in the face of the masses, lowered his head and admitted his mistakes, compensating the masses with 42 mu of land, 25 rooms, and a sum of cash. With the victory of the struggle, the masses actively requested to join the peasant association, with 35 new members, both male and female, joining in six or seven days. With the strengthening of the masses' power, many issues were raised against four other landlord households. After discussions and arbitration, the issues were also resolved. The five landlord households collectively returned 160 mu of land, 120 rooms, 2,190 silver yuan, and over 80,000 Jichaos to the masses. (Zhang Licheng, Zhao Zhongyang, Liu Xianpei)

　　屯留县联会规定
    中农问题调处法
    【本报讯】屯留过去在发动群众中，有些干部没把中农当成基本群众，开会不让中农参加，不吸收中农参加农会，甚至不少地方，还斗争了中农。于是形成了中农的情绪不安，生产消极，影响到翻身运动的开展。县联会搜集群众意见后，研究出几项对中农问题的调处办法：一、债务问题：凡手续已清者，不再追究，不论出利多少、大小，凡利过本者，清理手续了事。出利不足本或没给利和本者，补够本或还本了事。当时无力还者，分期偿还。二、借贷关系：过去借贷的东西未还，现在提出，以借多少还多少，借什么还什么了事，不得吃利滚。三、纠纷处理：如谁占过谁的便宜，现在提出，只可退还原物或表表“心思”，不得吃利滚算“斗争”账。四、吸收中农参加农会，领导中农诉苦，给中农分果实。这办法在三区千人翻身大会上宣布后，获得全体热烈的拥护，苏村中农徐建昌说：“俺过去是时时等着人来斗争，所以不好好生产，现在可放心了。“在大会上，过去永不啃气的中农，也都不断的发言。（岳北人民报）
    【本报长治讯】涉县石泊村，经过十天查减已获初步胜利，五户地主已偿还了农民的血汗账。运动从冬学中诉苦找穷根入手，群众觉悟提高，首先对顽固地主王洪飞展开说理斗争，群众将其历年来压诈的事实一一讲出，王在群众面前理屈力薄，遂低头认错，以土地四十二亩、房二十五间及一部现款赔偿群众。斗争胜利了，群众纷纷要求参加农会，六七天内新入会的即有男女三十五人。群众力量壮大了，又对四户地主提出许多问题，经过座谈、仲裁，问题也都解决。五户地主共给群众退还土地一百六十亩，房子一百二十间，银洋二千一百九十元、冀钞八万余元。（张李成、赵中央、刘献赔）
