The Soviet Union is prepared to sign disarmament and non-aggression pacts with capitalist countries, and to conclude commercial agreements."

　　纽约万人举行对苏合作大会
    【新华社延安五日电】纽约讯：三日晚，此间麦迪逊广场举行“对苏合作”大会，与会群众一万五千人，演讲者均主张加强美苏友谊。苏外次维辛斯基亦在会上发表演说，他说：“苏联外交政策乃以与一切友好国家友谊及和平合作为基础，苏联准备与资本主义国家签订裁军与互不侵犯公约，并缔结商业协定。”彼并信由于信用借款及资本主义国家从这些信用借款中能取得报酬，故有达到协定的基础。
