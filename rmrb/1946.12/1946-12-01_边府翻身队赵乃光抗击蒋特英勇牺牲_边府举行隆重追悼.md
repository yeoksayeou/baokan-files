Border Region Government's Turned-Over Team Member Zhao Naiguang Heroically Sacrifices Fighting Chiang Kai-shek's Agents; Border Region Government Holds Solemn Memorial Service

[Our Newspaper's News] Comrade Zhao Naiguang, a cadre of the Border Region Government, participated in the Linzhang Turned-Over Team this summer. He wholeheartedly helped the masses to turn over and was actively courageous. Although the village where he was stationed was only a dozen or so li away from the enemy, Comrade Naiguang never showed any fear. The local masses were thus rapidly mobilized, and the masses loved him very much, while the enemy hated him extremely. On the night of the 16th of this month, several armed Chiang Kai-shek agents suddenly surrounded Comrade Naiguang. Comrade Naiguang resisted heroically, but due to being outnumbered, he was hit by two bullets and gloriously sacrificed. When the bad news arrived, all comrades in the Border Region Government organs were extremely resentful of Chiang Kai-shek's gangster tactics and decided to hold a solemn memorial service at the Border Region Government's residence on the morning of November 30th. Comrade Zhao Naiguang was from Lucheng, Shanxi, was 28 years old, joined the Dare-to-Die Corps in 1938, joined the Communist Party in 1941, and served as an instructor in the Public Security Bureau and a staff member of the Prefectural Commissioner's Office's Judicial Section. He was transferred to the Border Region Government Court in early June of this year and participated in the Turned-Over Team in less than half a month. After Comrade Naiguang's sacrifice, the masses in the Linzhang Yanhe Turned-Over area held a memorial service a few days ago, vowing to avenge Comrade Naiguang. (Xiushan)

[Additional News] Yang Rong, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Border Region Government, sent a letter of condolence to the Border Region Government's Turned-Over Team on the 26th of last month. The original letter stated: The Turned-Over Movement is also the front line of struggle. You must be a hundred times more vigilant against the enemy, and especially in areas with harsh environments, you must pay special attention. Comrade Zhao Naiguang of the Border Region Government Court participated in the Turned-Over Team this summer. He has always been active, stood firm on the people's position, and led the masses to turn over. Recently, he was surrounded by secret agents. Although he resisted heroically, he ultimately sacrificed heroically due to being outnumbered. Hearing the news of Comrade Zhao's sacrifice for the people, all comrades were filled with grief and hated the Chiang bandits and reactionaries even more. In addition to our preparations for a memorial service and strengthening our work to resolutely avenge Comrade Zhao, we hope that you will also continue your efforts to thoroughly mobilize the masses and realize land to the tillers.

    【本报消息】边府干部赵乃光同志，今夏参加临漳翻身队，全心全意帮助群众翻身，积极勇敢，虽所在村庄距敌不过十数里，但乃光同志从未表示畏惧，当地群众乃得迅速发动起来，群众对他非常爱戴，敌人则极为嫉恨。本月十六日夜半，武装蒋特数人突将乃光同志包围，乃光同志英勇抵抗，终因寡不敌众，身中二弹，光荣牺牲。噩耗传来，边府机关全体同志对蒋特此种流氓手段痛恨万分，定于十一月三十日上午在边府驻地隆重追悼。按赵乃光同志山西潞城人，现年二十八岁，三八年参加决死队，四一年加入共产党，历任公安局指导员、专署司法科科员等职，今年六月初调边府法院，不到半月即参加翻身队。乃光同志牺牲后，临漳沿河翻身群众，已于日前追悼，誓为乃光同志报仇。（秀山）
    【另讯】边府杨戎正副主席，于上月二十六日致函边府翻身队慰问，原函略称：翻身运动也是斗争的前线，对敌人，你们要百倍警惕，特别是环境恶劣的地区更要特别注意。边府法院赵乃光同志今夏参加翻身队工作，一贯积极，站稳人民立场，带领群众翻身，最近被特务包围，虽经英勇抵抗，终因寡不敌众，壮烈牺牲，听到赵同志为人民牺牲的消息，全体同志悲痛万分，对蒋贼反动派更加痛恨，除我们筹备追悼大会，加强工作坚决为赵同志复仇外，希望你们也再接再厉，彻底发动群众，实现耕者有其田。
