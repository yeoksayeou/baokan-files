Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 2nd: According to a report in the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Daily on October 25th, the "Sino-American Review," a bi-monthly publication with a liberal slant, jointly run by some staff members of the U.S. Information Service in Shenyang and certain Chinese individuals, has recently been forced to cease publication by the Chiang government and the American authorities in China. It is reported that the aforementioned Sino-American individuals organized a "Sino-American Society" in Shenyang, with the aim of introducing American people's democratic movements and academics. The "Sino-American Review" was published by this society. By the second issue, it had already displeased the Kuomintang's Shenyang military and political authorities. By the third issue, two Kuomintang newspapers attacked it as a "Communist publication." The Kuomintang authorities even requested the U.S. Consul General to reorganize or shut down the "Sino-American Review," demanding that the U.S. Information Service staff disassociate themselves from the publication. The U.S. Consul General then forced all U.S. Information Service staff to resign, and the "Sino-American Review" was consequently shut down.
