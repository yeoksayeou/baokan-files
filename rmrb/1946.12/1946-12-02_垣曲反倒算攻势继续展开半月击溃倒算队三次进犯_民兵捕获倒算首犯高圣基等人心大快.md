　　【Report from Taiyue on the 27th of this month】 The Yuanqu people's counter-settlement offensive continues to unfold. In half a month, they have defeated three attacks by Chiang's army and settlement teams, killing and wounding 35 enemies, and capturing chief settlement criminal Gao Shengji, a "female village tyrant," and five others. On the morning of the 13th, the puppet "Love the Village Corps," shielding over a hundred members of the "Settlement Team" and carrying a heavy machine gun, again invaded our Magu Mountain. Although they launched two assaults with intense artillery fire, they were both repelled by the militia hero Li Shulin's guerrilla group using hand grenades. Li Shulin chased the enemy directly to the south bank of Wang Village, killing and wounding seven enemies and capturing one alive. On the 19th, Chiang's "Love the Village Corps" again shielded over eighty members of the "Settlement Team," invading Dongshi Village in two groups, attempting to threaten the masses in the village into returning settlements. After a heroic counterattack by the local militia and a certain company of the local corps, 18 enemies were killed and two were captured alive. On the 4th of this month, over 20 militiamen from the Third District actively raided Xixingma Village, capturing the important settlement element Gao Shengji. On the same day, they detoured and raided Macunbao, capturing the special agent "female village tyrant." Gao Shengji and the "female village tyrant" both took advantage of Chiang's army's occupation of Yuanqu, relying on Chiang's military power to "reverse the settlements" of the peasants who had been liberated. The "female village tyrant" is the daughter of An Yuqing, a large landlord in Yuanqu, nicknamed "female village tyrant" and "female housekeeper." She served as an intelligence officer in the enemy headquarters. During the mass struggle, she only returned one cow, but this time she insisted that the masses return five cows to her, and reversed all the grain and land that the masses had legally reclaimed, causing the masses to hate her to the bone. This time, after being captured by the militia, the people's hearts rejoiced, demanding that the female tyrant be brought to justice. One liberated peasant said, "Let them reverse the settlements! The good stuff is yet to come!" He then handed over five hand grenades and several rows of bullets taken from Chiang's army to the militia, saying, "You fight well, don't let those dogs reverse our land!"

　　垣曲反倒算攻势继续展开  半月击溃倒算队三次进犯
  　民兵捕获倒算首犯高圣基等人心大快
    【本报太岳二十七日电】垣曲人民反倒算攻势继续展开，半月内击溃蒋军与倒算队三次进攻，毙伤敌人三十五名，并捕获倒算首犯高圣基、“女乡绅”等五名。十三日晨伪“爱乡团”掩护“倒算队”百余人，携重机枪一挺向我麻姑山再次进犯，他们虽以猛烈炮火两次冲锋，均被民兵英雄李树林的游击组用手榴弹击溃，李树林将该敌直追至王村南岸，共毙伤敌七名，生俘一名。十九日蒋“爱乡团”又掩护“倒算队”八十余人，分两路进犯东石村，企图威胁该村群众倒算，经当地民兵与地方兵团某连英勇迎击，毙敌十八名，生俘二名。本月四日，三区民兵二十余人，主动袭入西型马村，将重要倒算分子高圣基捉回，同日又绕道袭入马村堡，将特务“女乡绅”捉回。该高圣基及“女乡绅”都是趁蒋军占领垣曲后，恃蒋军势力向翻身农民“倒算”，“女乡绅”是垣曲大地主安余庆的女儿，外号叫“女乡绅”、“女管家”，在敌司令部担任情报员，群众斗争时她仅退出一头牛，此次却非叫群众倒算给她五头牛不可，并将群众依法收回的粮食土地，全部倒算回去，群众恨之入骨。此次被民兵捉回后，人心大快，要求将女奸霸正法。一位翻身农民说：“让他们倒算吧，好的在后边哩。”他又将拿下蒋军的五个手榴弹和几排子弹，送给了民兵说：“你们好好打，不要让狗肉的把咱的土地倒算回去。”
