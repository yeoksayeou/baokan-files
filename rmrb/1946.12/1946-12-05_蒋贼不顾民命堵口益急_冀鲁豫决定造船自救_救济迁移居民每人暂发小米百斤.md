[This article transmitted by our newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch on the 1st] The Yellow River situation is critical. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Committee convened a joint meeting of responsible persons from various special districts, counties, and repair and defense offices/sections along the river on the 22nd of last month. Jia Xinzhai, Deputy Director of the Administrative Office, reported that this time the Kuomintang's blocking of the breach is more intense than ever before, as if it were the final stage. Coordinating with their malicious military plans and actions, the Kuomintang wants to make the Yellow River flow north within twenty days. After robbery and slaughter, they follow it up with the Yellow River, attempting to permanently divide the liberated areas of Henan and Hebei. Comrade Zhao Mingfu, our Yellow River Committee representative, personally witnessed that only twenty zhang of the Huayuankou breach remained unclosed. In the past, stone blocks could not complete the work in a short period. Now the Kuomintang suddenly uses the old method, using "soft materials instead of hard materials," bundling grass and sorghum stalks with ropes and throwing them into the water, and repairing two additional layers of gates, estimated to be completed within twenty days or a month. They have already dug more than three li of diversion canals, and now there are still 2,000 people rushing to dig. We certainly still need to negotiate with UNRRA for supplies, but the main thing should be our own preparations. First, inspect the embankments and rush to repair dangerous works. Although we are quite tired from fighting, for self-salvation, we should persevere as we do in war. Second, build ships. In order to prevent the liberated areas from being separated from the north and south, to allow refugees and military dependents driven by the Chiang Kai-shek gang to return home as soon as possible, and to facilitate our military and civilians' future counter-offensive, building ships is a major task. Third, the relocation of residents in the river area must be reminded once again. In the past, we negotiated for 15 billion in relocation fees, but it has not been given to this day. Now we have to find our own solutions and the government will allocate some relief funds first. Subsequently, the repair and defense offices/sections reported on the embankment construction situation, and discussions were immediately held, deciding on three methods of shipbuilding: First, each county will rush to build; second, loans will be provided to ferry boat owners to build their own, at 500,000 yuan per boat; third, loans will be provided to repair existing civilian boats of three zhang or more. Regarding the relocation of residents, a temporary relief of 100 jin of rice per person and 50 jin for children will be provided. The conference also discussed planting willows on the embankments and beaches, establishing stone yards, and various organizations and plans.

　　蒋贼不顾民命堵口益急
    冀鲁豫决定造船自救
  　救济迁移居民每人暂发小米百斤
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】黄河情况紧急，鲁冀豫行署及冀鲁豫黄河委员会于上月二十二日召开沿河各专署、各县、各修防处、段负责人联席会。行署副主任贾心斋报告略谓：这次国民党堵口比过去任何时候都紧张，好像是最后的紧张了。国民党配合其恶毒的军事计划与行动，想在二十天内使黄水北来。抢劫杀戮之后又继之以黄水，想永远分割我河南河北之解放区。我黄委会代表赵明甫同志亲见花园口口门现仅余二十丈未合龙。过去以石块不能短时期完工，目下国民党忽用旧法，以“软料代硬料”，将草和秫秸用绳捆扎投水，并又修二道垛口门，估计可能于二十天或一月内堵完。并已挖引河三里多长，现在还有二千人在赶挖。我们固然还要和联总交涉物资，但主要应是我们自己准备。第一、检查堤防，赶修险工。虽说我们打仗打得相当疲劳，但是为了自救，应和战争一样，我们需要再接再厉。第二、造船。为了使解放区南北不被隔断，为了使被蒋贼驱逐过来的难民、军属早日回家，为了便于我们军民将来反攻，制造船只是极大的任务。第三、河道居民迁移，必须再一次的提醒。过去我们交涉了一百五十亿的迁移费，但至今没给。如今我们不得不自己想办法，先由政府拨一部分救济。继由各修防处、段报告堤工情况，旋即进行讨论，决定三种造船办法：一、各县赶造；二、贷款渡口船户自造，五十万元一只；三、贷款修补民间三丈以上的船只。关于迁移居民，暂以每人一百斤米、小孩五十斤救济。大会并讨论堤滩植柳，建立石场，及各种组织与计划。
