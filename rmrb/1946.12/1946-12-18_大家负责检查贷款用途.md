Criticism and Suggestions

　　Everyone is Responsible for Checking the Use of Loans
    This year's large-scale production loans have been distributed to various villages, but many villages have not used the loans for organizing production after receiving them. Some cadres think this is solely the bank's task and do not pay attention to this work, so the loans cannot play their role. For example, a village in Licheng borrowed 80,000 yuan in the name of a mutual aid group, but the village cooperative used it for speculation, and the masses did not receive the loans, which caused some complaints. A district cadre working in the village did not even inquire about this matter. All localities should pay attention and not regard it as solely the bank's task. Every comrade working in the countryside should be responsible for checking the use of loans. (Zhi Ping)

　　大家负责检查贷款用途
    今年的大批生产贷款已都发放到各个乡村中了，但有不少村拿回贷款后，没有用到组织生产上，有些干部以为这单纯是银行的任务，也不注意这一工作，贷款才能起到他的作用。如黎城某村以互助组名义贷款八万元，回村合作社做了投机买卖，群众没有贷上款，对此很有些意见，有一区干部在该村工作，也不过问这件事。各地应注意，不要看成是单纯银行的任务，每一在乡工作同志，应都有检查贷款用途的责任。（支平）
