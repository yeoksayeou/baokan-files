*Liberation Daily* commentary on the 2nd:

While Chiang Kai-shek's illegal "National Assembly" is in session, the Chiang government has successively制造 two bloody tragedies. The first is that Zhu Xuefan, Director-General of the Labor Association, was assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in Hong Kong, and the second is the massacre of Shanghai hawkers by Chiang Kai-shek's military police. These two tragedies fully prove that the so-called "constitution" being concocted by Chiang's "National Assembly" is nothing more than a decoration for the murderer government.

The Shanghai hawker masses marched and petitioned the Kuomintang authorities, merely to preserve their minimum livelihood rights, because the Chiang, Soong, Kong, and Chen families monopolized all markets, banned their business, and made it impossible for them to make a living. Their march and petition were completely reasonable and legal, but the government of the Chiang, Soong, Kong, and Chen families took ruthless suppression measures against them. It mobilized military police and secret agents, and used weapons given to it by American imperialism - rifles, machine guns, tear gas, etc. - to brutally harm and屠杀 these starving and freezing compatriots.

Chiang Kai-shek and his small group are deceiving people with "rule of law" all the time, but looking at the corpses and bloodstains of the poor people who sacrificed in this hawker tragedy, what law is there under Chiang Kai-shek's rule? Chiang Kai-shek only has one law, that is, only the Chiang, Soong, Kong, and Chen families are allowed to get rich, and the people are not allowed to eat; only the dictatorial government is allowed to kill people at will, and the people are not allowed to assemble, form associations, petition, or march for the most basic civil rights. However, the broad masses of the Chiang-controlled areas will definitely rise up to resist this kind of law of Chiang Kai-shek, and this kind of law is completely incompatible with the fundamental law generally recognized by the Chinese people - the Political Consultative Conference resolution.

The hawker massacre has aroused great indignation among people from all walks of life in the Beijing and Shanghai areas. Now, the Kuomintang authorities are issuing statements one after another, falsely accusing the hawker masses of "going beyond the norm" and falsely claiming that the actions of the hawker masses are "planned political riots" in order to create an excuse for more brutal suppression of the masses and to frame the CCP and other democrats. The reactionaries had already used this kind of conspiracy in the Kunming tragedy a year ago, and it cannot deceive anyone with discerning eyes; on the contrary, this kind of conspiracy can only increase the people's indignation.

The hawker massacre once again reflects the seriousness of the crisis of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule. This tragedy occurred in Shanghai, where the forces of the US-China reactionaries are most concentrated. However, precisely because the reactionary rule makes it difficult for the people to live, the great movement of the people to fight for freedom and the right to survival will inevitably grow stronger and stronger regardless of all oppression.

### 上海摊贩惨案

　　上海摊贩惨案
    解放日报二日时评
    正在蒋记非法“国大”开会的时候，蒋政府又连续制造了两件流血惨案。第一件是劳协理事长朱学范在香港遭遇蒋介石特务暗害，第二件便是上海摊贩被蒋介石军警屠杀。这两件惨案完全证明蒋记“国大”正在泡制中的所谓“宪法”，除了是杀人犯政府的装饰品以外，别无意义。
    上海摊贩群众向国民党当局游行请愿，仅仅要为保存他们的最低限度的糊口权利，因为蒋宋孔陈四大家为了垄断一切市场，取缔他们的营业，使他们无法谋生。他们的游行请愿是完全合理与合法的，但是蒋宋孔陈四大家的政府竟对他们采取无情的镇压手段，它竟然动员了军警特务，使用了美帝国主义给它的武器——步枪、机关枪、催泪弹等来惨害和屠杀这些饥寒交迫的同胞。
    蒋介石及其一小群口口声声以“法治”欺骗人，但是看了看这次摊贩惨案牺牲者的贫民的尸体和血迹，在蒋介石统治下有什么法律可言？蒋介石有的只有一条法律，那就是只许蒋宋孔陈四大家发财，不准人民吃饭；只准独裁政府随便杀人，不准人民集会结社请愿游行最起码的公民权利。但是蒋介石这种法律，蒋管区广大人民是一定要起来反抗的，这种法律是和中国人民所公认的根本大法——政协决议是完全水火不相容的。
    摊贩被惨杀案已经引起了京沪一带各阶层人士的广大义愤，现在国民党当局正在纷纷发表谈话，诬指摊贩群众“越出常轨”，并妄称摊贩群众的行动为“有计划的政治暴动”，以制造更凶惨镇压群众的借口，以及嫁祸于中共及其他民主人士。这种阴谋诡计，反动派在一年前昆明惨案早已施用过了，蒙不过任何明眼人的；相反的，这种阴谋诡计只能更增加人民的义愤。
    摊贩惨案再次反映了蒋介石独裁统治的危机的严重，这个惨案发生在上海，那里是中美反动派势力最集中的地方，然而正因为反动统治使人民难以生活下去，人民群众争取自由和生存权利的伟大运动，必将不顾一切压迫而日益壮大起来。
