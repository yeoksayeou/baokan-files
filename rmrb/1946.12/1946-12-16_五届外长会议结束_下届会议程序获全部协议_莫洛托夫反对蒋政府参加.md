Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: New York dispatch: The fifth postwar Foreign Ministers Meeting is scheduled to conclude yesterday. In the meetings of the 10th and 11th, the four foreign ministers discussed and decided on the agenda for the next meeting to be held in Moscow on March 1st next year to discuss the German and Austrian issues, based on the draft submitted by the foreign ministers' assistants regarding the resolution of outstanding details of the five-nation treaty. Regarding the agenda of the next meeting, the foreign ministers had reached almost full agreement at the meeting on the 11th. At the meeting, Molotov suggested that if the opinions of other relevant Allied countries on resolving the German issue were to be heard, then the procedure for hearing them should be drafted. Bevin expressed his willingness to accept this compromise suggestion, and it was decided to immediately appoint the foreign ministers' assistants to begin this work. As the meeting was coming to an end, Bevin proposed that the Chiang Kai-shek government should participate in the next Moscow Foreign Ministers Meeting and participate in drafting the German peace treaty. Molotov expressed his opposition and opposed inviting the Chiang Kai-shek government to the future peace conference on Germany. After fierce debate, no result was achieved. This is the second time that Mr. Mo has opposed the Chiang Kai-shek government's participation in drafting the German peace treaty. The first time was at the London Foreign Ministers Meeting in September last year.
    Regarding the final five-nation treaty, the four foreign ministers decided that the four powers would formally sign it in Paris on February 10th next year. The four foreign ministers also decided to establish two four-power committees: one to conduct on-site inspections of Italian colonies and formulate recommendations, and one to go to the Free Territory of Trieste to determine the initial financial needs of the area. The four foreign ministers also decided to organize an eleven-nation committee (including the four powers and South, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland, and Switzerland) to supervise the administrative facilities of the government of the Free Territory of Trieste.

　　五届外长会议结束
    下届会议程序获全部协议       
    莫洛托夫反对蒋政府参加
    【新华社延安十三日电】纽约讯：战后第五届外长会议定于昨日结束。前此十日及十一日会议上，四外长讨论定于明年三月一日在莫斯科举行的下届会议讨论德奥问题的程序，以外长助理所提交的关于五国和约未决的细节之解决草案。关于下届会议程序，各外长在十一日的会议上几已全部协议。会上莫洛托夫建议：如果要听取其他有关盟国对解决德国问题之意见，那么应起草听取的程序。贝文表示愿意接受此折衷建议，于是乃决定立即指定外长助理开始此一工作。当会议快结束时，贝纳斯提议蒋介石政府应参加下届莫斯科外长会议，并参与草拟德国和约工作。莫洛托夫表示反对，并反对蒋政府为将来召开对德和会时之邀请国。激辩之后，未获结果。莫氏之反对蒋政府参预草拟对德和约此为第二次。第一次为去年九月之伦敦外长会议上。
    关于五国最后和约，四外长决定四强于明年二月十日在巴黎正式签字。四外长又决定指定成立两个四强委员会：一为赴意殖民地实地考察并制定建议。一为赴的港自由区决定该区初期财政需要。四外长又决定组织十一国委员会（包括四强及南、意、捷、奥、匈、波、瑞士）监督的港自由区政府之行政设施。
