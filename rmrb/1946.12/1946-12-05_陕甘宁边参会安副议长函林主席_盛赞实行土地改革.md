　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. Mr. An Wenqin, Vice-Chairman of the Shan-Gan-Ning Border Region Assembly, in order to realize the Border Region Government's land policy of "land to the tiller," took the lead by generously donating 300 qing (one qing equals three mu) of land in September of this year. Recently, in response to Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan assembling large forces in an attempt to attack the Border Region, he again wrote to Chairman Lin of the Border Region Government on November 17th, praising the implementation of land reform and calling on the people of the Border Region to unite and resolutely defend the Border Region. Vice-Chairman An pointed out in his letter: Because "land to the tiller" has not been implemented, the rich own fields stretching for miles, while the poor do not have enough land to stand on. Landlords manipulate, and tenants suffer, which is truly lamentable! Our Border Region Government, seeing this, is implementing "land to the tiller," with the best intentions and the most virtuous methods. It is even more important to be prudent and thorough, ensuring that landlords cannot conceal their land, and poor peasants can receive tangible benefits, so that the country becomes rich and strong, and the people become prosperous and content. Now, reactionary elements are borrowing foreign power to attack the liberated areas, leading to national peril and suffering for the people. All those with blood and spirit should unite to defend their homes, consolidate the Border Region, never slacken, and never retreat, striving to achieve our goals.

　　陕甘宁边参会安副议长函林主席
    盛赞实行土地改革
    【新华社延安二日电】陕甘宁边区参议会副议长安文钦先生为实现边区政府耕者有其田之土地政策，曾以身作则，于今年九月间慷慨献地三百垧（一垧三亩）；近以蒋胡集结大兵企图进攻边区，复在十一月十七日致书边区政府林主席，盛赞实行土地改革，并号召边区人民团结一致，坚决保卫边区。安副议长信中指出：因未实行耕者有其田，以致富者田连阡陌，贫者身无立锥，地主操纵，佃户受困，诚可痛也！我边府见及于此，实行耕者有其田，意至美而法至善，更须审慎周详，务使地主不得隐瞒，贫农得沾实惠，国家富强，人民丰足，庶有豸乎。现在反动分子借外力进攻解放区，以致国家危亡，人民涂炭，凡有血气者，应团结一致，捍卫家乡，巩固边区，决不松懈，决不退让，务期达到目的而后已。
