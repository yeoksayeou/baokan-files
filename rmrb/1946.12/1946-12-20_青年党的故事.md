　　The Story of the Youth Party
    ·Wu Ge·
        A Solemn Party Admission Ceremony
    When the Northern Expedition had not yet succeeded, the Youth Party, just like now, wholeheartedly supported the government of the time. They carried the five-color flag of red, yellow, blue, white, and black, following Sun Chuanfang and Zhang Zuolin. They regarded the five-color flag of the time as their party flag.
    The five-color flag was their sole and inviolable authority. I remember once when Lu Xun "offended" it, Chang Yansheng even argued with him. The first thing a new member of the Youth Party had to do was to acknowledge the five-color flag and bow to it three times; the admission ceremony of the Youth Party was merely bowing to the five-color flag three times.
    Sun Chuanfang fell, all the Northern warlords fell, and even Zhang Zuolin was killed by the Japanese. The national flag was changed to the Blue Sky with a White Sun over a field of Red, and it was announced that the five-color flag was no longer allowed. As a result, the Youth Party seemed to have lost its spiritual foundation, especially since they had not yet reached an understanding with the then-National Government. Therefore, a very troubling question for them was: what should they have new recruits worship?
    At this time, the Youth Party in Sichuan solved this serious problem. At that time, Sichuan was still using a copper coin called "worth 200 cash." That kind of copper coin was issued by a Sichuan warlord who was "sitting on two boats." He engraved two crossed flags on that copper coin, one with twelve corners representing the Northern Expeditionary Army, and the other being the five-color flag.
    The Youth Party members cleverly utilized this copper coin. They told the new party members to salute this copper coin. According to a Youth Party member who is now not very enthusiastic, when this ceremony was first held, someone held up a copper coin, half-covered (the side representing the Northern Expeditionary Army), and told people to salute the copper coin. Later, it was not known how, but an order came from above, saying that it was permissible to salute the entire copper coin.
            Unexpected Harvest
    Last autumn, the Youth Party held a Sichuan representative conference. Before the meeting, even the Youth Party itself did not know that a representative conference was going to be held, perhaps they hadn't even dreamed of it. Because this representative conference was truly a miracle and an unexpected harvest.
    During the "September 18th Incident" years, there was a Youth Party student named Chen from the High School affiliated with Sichuan University. After graduating and having nothing to do, he returned to his hometown of Peng'an. He temporarily worked as a primary school teacher in the local area. Because Chen was, after all, a rather enthusiastic youth, he had quite a few local youths who associated with him. However, the interactions at that time were just a general form of interaction. It was not until the "July 7th Incident" outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War that the young people themselves felt that there should be an organization. Naturally, Chen was one of those who felt this way. However, Chen's relationship with the Youth Party had been interrupted at that time. Moreover, he was not very enthusiastic about the party. Their goal was simply to compete for positions in the local area. Until the first half of last year, these organized youths had almost monopolized all the primary schools and local administrative work in Peng'an.
    Just as the youths of Peng'an were active, Chen, who was a member of the Youth Party, accidentally learned that the Youth Party's newspaper had long been moved from Wuhan to Chengdu. In other words, he already knew that the Youth Party could be slightly more publicly active. In order to compete for leadership among the local youths, Chen openly declared in 1940 that he was a member of the Youth Party. He transplanted the Youth Party's principles into the minds of those pure youths. Thus, Peng'an became a den of the Youth Party. Even so, the Youth Party of Peng'an was not connected with the Youth Party of Chengdu. The Youth Party of Chengdu did not know that there was also a Youth Party in Peng'an, and the Youth Party of Peng'an was unwilling to make a special trip to Chengdu to make contact because there was no need.
    This continued for several years. Last summer, Peng'an established a formal advisory council. The councilors had to be elected by the people. Of course, the party members of the Youth Party also participated in the election. As a result of the election, because most of the local grassroots personnel were from the Youth Party, the elected county councilors, except for one who was the secretary-general of the Kuomintang, were mostly from the Youth Party. After the councilors were elected, what followed was the mutual election of the speaker by the councilors. Who should be the speaker? Judging from the composition of the councilors, it should of course be a member of the Youth Party. However, it turned out not to be. The Youth Party councilors did not know how to be the speaker, so the result was that the Youth Party negotiated with the Kuomintang: let the Kuomintang person be the speaker, in exchange for the Kuomintang being responsible for giving the position of principal of the county high school to the Youth Party.
    After the transaction was completed, the Youth Party people felt that they had suffered too much, but they couldn't blame anyone. After a discussion, they suddenly realized that they had suffered because they had no connection with the party's upper-level organization. At the same time, they heard that Li Huang and others were in Chengdu, so they decided to send someone to Chengdu to make contact. They came to the New China Daily to report the situation in Peng'an. Then they told Li Huang. Li Huang was surprised. In those days, he publicly said: We can simply claim to have one million party members. Immediately, the clever Li Huang decided that it would be better to take this opportunity to hold a Sichuan representative conference and sort out the party affairs of the counties. So he immediately asked the person from Peng'an: "We have already decided to hold a provincial representative conference in the near future, it is very good that you came."
    The provincial representative conference lasted for two days. The representatives who came, apart from those from Peng'an, mostly temporarily brought a sign from some county as Chengdu party members, to relieve the embarrassment. At that time, it was decided that the provincial party headquarters would send personnel to the counties to conduct on-the-spot investigations and sort out party affairs. The person put forward was a provincial committee member who was very popular in Chengdu.
    Later, this investigator did indeed take a trip to the counties. The achievement he brought back was selling several hundred copies of the New China Daily.
            Two Disappointed Figures
    Speaking of it, no one should feel frustrated in the Youth Party at this time when it is in favor. But it just so happens that, coincidentally, when everyone is triumphant, the leader Li Huang becomes lonely.
    The Youth Party has always adopted a multilateral policy, which even they themselves have never denied. The method of implementation is for several leaders to work separately. During the Anti-Japanese War, they ran on the path of Wang Jingwei, while Li Huang was both dealing with the government and flirting with the democrats. As a result, Li Huang was very powerful in Sichuan, while Zeng Qi was never mentioned once in Sichuan. When Li Huang was in power, Yang Shuming, Liu Dongyan, and others who were close to Li were all good cadres of Li, and Li stood up straight. After all, his vision was a bit higher than Zeng Qi's, so he held the banner of democracy a little higher. However, the Anti-Japanese War was won, and China after the victory was going to fight a civil war. Zeng Qi was much more useful than Li Huang in terms of anti-communism. The authorities appreciated Zeng Qi. Zeng Qi being appreciated was a small matter, but it was pitiful that the people Li considered closest to him also abandoned him and went to Zeng. At this time, Li was really a little angry, but he thought he could come back to Chengdu to refine himself, maybe the small party members in Sichuan would still support him. Who would have thought that when he returned to Chengdu, the intermediate-level cadres in Sichuan had already smashed him long ago. Apart from a group of Sichuan party members who simply went to Zeng Qi's side, a reform movement within the party arose. Jiang Yungang, Wei Shizhen, and others formed a small organization themselves, openly saying: We don't want that bureaucratic stuff. Li Huang fell. After falling, Li Huang once gave a speech full of complaints at Li Wen's memorial service. He said: "Mr. and Mrs. Li Wen fought for democracy and died, and they still got the beautiful name of "martyrs of democracy," but what about us who have been doing it for more than 20 years? …" At this point, tears welled up in his eyes, and he pounded his chest with both hands.
    In addition, there is a lesser-known figure named Wu Zhaohai. Although this person is not famous, he is also one of the founders of the Youth Party. According to Wu himself, "I am not the Youth Party of this group, I am the real Youth Party." But for this person, the Youth Party neither denies him, nor regards him as a founder. Recently, Wu occasionally appeared in Chengdu, but every time he comes to Chengdu twice, he always finds a few acquaintances to talk about the Youth Party. When he talks about the Youth Party, he just scolds. I remember once he said: "Zeng Qi and Li Huang once scolded Wang Jingwei as Chiang Kai-shek's concubine, but in fact? Zeng Qi is Chiang Kai-shek's old mother on the bed. After this old mother on the bed was used by the master, he only sewed her a pair of dark blue cloth pants, so she was flattered and said everywhere: the master loves me so much."

　　青年党的故事
    ·吴格·
        严肃的入党仪式
    当北伐还没有成功的时候，青年党同现在一样巴心巴肝的拥护着当时的政府，他们抗着一面红黄蓝白黑的五色旗跟着孙传芳转；跟着张作霖转。他们把当时的五色国旗，当成了他们的党旗。
    五色旗是他们的唯一不可侵犯的权威。记得鲁迅有一次“冒犯”了一下，常燕生还和他吵了一架。一个刚入青年党的，第一就是得承认五色旗，向五色旗行三鞠躬；青年党的入党仪式也就仅是向五色旗行三鞠躬。
    孙传芳垮了，全体北洋军阀都垮了，连张作霖也被日本炸死之后，国旗改为青天白日满地红，宣布了不准再用五色国旗。这样一来，青年党便像灵魂失去了依据似的，尤其是他们还没有来得及同当时的国民政府取得谅解，所以他们很苦恼的一个问题。就是：用什么给新收的党徒膜拜呢？
    就在这个时候，四川的青年党解决了这个严重问题。当时四川还在通用着一种“当二百文”的铜币，那种铜币是“脚踏两只船”的一个四川军阀发行的，他在那种铜币上刻着两支叉义着的旗子，一支是十二个角的代表北伐军的旗，一支就是五色国旗了。
    青年党人聪明地利用了这铜币。他们叫新入党的党徒向这铜币行礼。据一个现在已不甚热中的青年党徒对我说：当初举行这种仪式时还是一个人高举着遮了半边（代表北伐军那边）的铜板叫人向铜板行礼，后来不知怎样上面又来了一个命令，说可以向整个的铜元行礼了。
            意外的收获
    去年秋天，青年党举行了一次四川代表大会。会前连青年党自身也不晓得要开一个代表会，也许连做梦也没有想到。因为这个代表会实在是一个奇迹，也是意外的收获。
    “九一八”那些年代，有一个川大附高中姓陈的青年党学生党员，因毕业之后无事可做，便回到了蓬安原籍。暂时在本地当小学教员。因为陈究竟是一个颇为热情的青年，所以同他交往的本地青年也不少。不过那时的交往也仅是一种普遍交往而已，一直到“七七”抗日战争爆发了，青年们本身觉得应有一种组织才对。有这种感觉的人，自然陈也是其中的一个。但陈当时已与青年党的关系中断了。而且也不大热心于党。他们目的只不过如何在地方上争位置，截至去年上半年，这种有组织的青年，几乎包揽完了全蓬安的小学校和地方行政工作。
    正当蓬安的青年们活跃的时候，青年党籍的陈，偶然知道，青年党的机关报已早由武汉搬到了成都，换言之，他已经晓得青年党是可以稍微公开一点的活动了。陈为了要在地方青年中争领导权，在民国二十九年，陈公开了他是青年党。他把青年党的那一套道理移植进那些纯洁青年的脑子了，于是蓬安便成了一个青年党的窝。虽然如此，但蓬安的青年党是与成都的青年党没有连系的。成都的青年党不晓得蓬安也有青年党，蓬安的青年党因为没那个需要也就不肯专程到成都来联络。
    这样继续了几年。去年夏，蓬安成立了正式参议会。议员要经过民选。这样当然青年党的党徒也参加了竞选，选举的结果，因为地方基层人员多是青年党，所以选出来的县参议员除了有一位是国民党的书记长而外，其余多属青年党。议员选出了之后，紧接着的是由议员互选议长，谁该当议长呢？以议员的成份来看当然应该是青年党人，可是后来居然不是的。青年党的议员们不懂得怎样当议长，所以结果是青年党同国民党交涉：议长让国民党的人当，交换的条件，是国民党负责把县中校长给予青年党。
    生易成交以后，青年党的人觉得自己太吃亏了，可是又怪不得谁，讨论了一阵，才恍然大悟到吃亏在与党的上级机构没有连系。同时又听说李璜等正在成都，于是便决定派人到成都来接头，他们到新中国日报来把蓬安的情况报告了一番。跟着又告诉了李璜。李璜惊讶了，他在那几天里公然说：我们简直可以号称有党员一百万。跟即，聪明李璜便决定不如乘机来一次四川代表会，把各县的党务整理一下，所以当即就问蓬安的来人说：“我们早就决定了短期之内开全省代表大会的，你来的甚好。”
    全省代表大会开了两天，到的代表除了蓬安的而外，大多为成都党员临时带了一个什么县的牌子，来解了解嘲。当时决定了由省党部派员到各县去实地考察并整理党务，推出的人是一个在成都风头甚健的省委。
    后来果然这位考察人到各县走了一遭，带回的成绩就是替新中国日报推销了几百份报。
            两个失意的人物
    说起来，青年党在现在这个正是得宠的时候是不应该有人感觉失意的。可是事情就巧在这儿，巧在这个众人都在得意时，领袖李璜却孤独起来了。
    青年党一向采的是多边政策，这事连他们自己也不曾否认过。实行的方法就是几个领袖分头去搞。抗战时期，曾奔走汪精卫的路，李璜则一面与政府周旋，一面又与民主派勾勾搭搭，这样一来，李璜在四川很得势，反过来就是曾琦在四川没有被人提起过一次。当其李璜得势之时，接近李璜的杨叔明、刘东岩等人都是李的好干部，李的腰伸得挺直。凭了他的眼光究竟比曾琦高明点，所以他把民主持得高一点。可是抗战胜利了，胜利后的中国要打内战，曾琦在反共方面比李璜有用得多。当局赏识了曾琦。曾琦被赏识的事小，可怜的是李所认为最接近的人也抛了他而去投奔曾，这时的李，气可是真的有些气了，但以为可以再回成都来炼一炼，也许四川的小党员还会拥戴他，谁想到他回到成都来的时候，四川的中级干部已经早就把他砸了。四川党员除开一部干脆走到曾琦那边去了的而外，党内的革新运动起来了。姜蕴刚、魏时珍他们自己搞了一个小组织，公开说：我们不来官僚那一套。李璜垮了。垮后的李璜曾经在李闻追悼会上发表过一番满是牢骚的演说，他说：“李闻两先生为民主奋斗而死了，还落得一个“民主烈士”的美名，但我们干了二十多年却又有什么呢？………”说至此，两眼流泪，两手捶胸。
    此外还有一个是不大知名人物，叫做吴肇海。此人虽不出名，却是他也是青年党的创始人。据吴本人表示：“ 我不是这一起青年党，我是真正的青年党”。可是对于这个人，青年党既不否认他，也没有把他当成一个创始人看待。最近吴偶尔也在成都出现，但他每到成都来二次总要找几个认识的人谈谈青年党，他一谈起青年党来就是骂，记得有一次他这样说：“曾琦李璜曾经骂过汪精卫是蒋老总的小老婆，其实呢？曾琦却是蒋老总的上炕老妈儿，这个上炕老妈儿被老爷用了之后，仅仅替她缝了一条毛蓝布裤子，这样就受宠若惊的到处说：老爷多爱我。”
    九月二十六日寄自成都。
