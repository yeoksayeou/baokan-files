　　Distributing Fruits According to Issues is Inappropriate
　　Qin County is Studying and Implementing the "Land to the Tiller" Distribution Method
　　[Our Taiyue Dispatch, 1st] In some areas of Qin County, inappropriate distribution of fruits has hindered the rapid realization of "land to the tiller." The general principle of distribution in these areas is that whoever accounts for it, it belongs to them. To remedy the shortcomings of this method, it is also stipulated that if someone has no accounts to settle or not many, the masses can promote a spirit of friendship and help each other. The results of implementing this in the three villages of Beili, Lianglougou, and Dougou have produced many phenomena that are inconsistent with the "land to the tiller" policy. First, the vast majority of the fruits are distributed to activists or those who are good at speaking, while poor peasants get very little. In Lianglougou, since mobilizing the masses this spring, there have been sixteen struggles, and the fruits obtained amounted to 388 *shi* of grain. Zhang Jiufang, who is good at speaking, received more than 60 *shi* alone, while ordinary peasants received very little. Second, under these circumstances, whether the poor can turn over depends on the amount of property of the struggle target. If they encounter a struggle target with a lot of property, they can get more; otherwise, no matter how much suffering they endure, there is no way. Wang Wenguang, a poor peasant in Beili Village, participated in struggles for more than nine months and only got a jar worth 100 *yang*. Another person, Cui Shuilin, whose family situation was similar to his, got eleven *mu* of land, eleven houses, and things worth more than 54,000 *yuan*. Third, middle peasants and slightly better-off poor peasants were also robbed by traitors and borrowed a lot of money from others. Today, the liquidation yields a lot. However, the utterly poor, in addition to being beaten and scolded countless times, had nothing else robbed by traitors. Even if they borrowed money, it was only three or five *diao*, which does not amount to much when calculated. Therefore, it is often difficult for poor peasants to turn over if whoever accounts for it, gets it. Zhang Xiangquan, a hired worker in Dougou Village, said, "Suffering for the landlord for ten years is not as good as someone reporting a loss." Promoting the spirit of friendship has not been very effective, because it is more difficult to get back what has already been taken. Although Zhang Jiufang in Lianglougou returned ten *shi* of grain, it was the result of district cadres persuading and forcing him. The leadership has discovered these problems and is studying the distribution method of implementing "land to the tiller."

　　按问题分果实不妥
    沁县正研究贯彻耕者有其田分法
    【本报太岳一日电】沁县部分地区因分果实不当，阻碍了耕者有其田迅速实现。这些地区一般分配的原则是谁算下的归谁。为了补救这个办法的不足，又规定如有人无账可算或算的不多，群众之间可发扬友爱精神，互相资助。在北里、良楼沟、陡沟三村实行结果，产生了许多与实现耕者有其田方针不符的现象。一、果实的绝大部分为积极分子或会说话的人分去，贫苦农民所得极少。良楼沟自今春发动群众以来，大小斗争十六次，所得果实合粮食三百八十八石，有一个能说会道的张九芳一人便得到六十余石，一般农民则所得甚少。二、在这种情况下，穷人能否翻身，决定于斗争对象财产的多少。遇上财产多的斗争对象便能多得，否则苦再多也没办法。北里村贫苦农民王文光参加斗争九个多月，仅得到一个缸，值洋百元。而另外一个和他家境差不多的崔水林却得到十一亩土地，十一间房屋，与价值五万四千余元的东西。三、中农与生活略好一点的贫农也被汉奸抢劫过、也曾大批借过人家的钱，今日清算所得甚多。而赤贫除挨过无数打骂外，别无他物被汉奸抢劫，即使也借过钱，也是三吊五吊，算起来数目不大。所以谁算出来谁得，贫苦农民翻身常是很困难的。陡沟村雇工张香泉说：“给地主受了十年的苦，还不如人家报一笔损失。”而发扬友爱精神，并无很大成效，因为已经拿在手的东西再让拿出来就较困难。良楼沟张九芳虽退出粮食十石，但那是区干部一面劝勉、一面强迫的结果。领导上发现这些问题，正研究贯彻耕者有其田之分法。
