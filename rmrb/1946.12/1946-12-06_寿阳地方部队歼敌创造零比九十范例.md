　　【Taixing, Our Newspaper, 3rd】Shouyang local armed forces have created a model battle case of zero to ninety. Over 120 members of the "Revenge Squad" and plainclothes team of the occupying Shouyang Yan's puppet regime, carrying four machine guns and four small cannons, advanced from Shouyang city and Mashou Railway Station on the 29th of last month to invade the villages of Bishi and Yancun. Our Shouyang local troops rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and launched a fatal blow before the enemy could deploy their firepower. A total of over 20 enemies were killed, over 30 were wounded, and 42 were captured alive. Four small cannons, three machine guns, 19 rifles, one pistol, thousands of rounds of ammunition, binoculars, and other military supplies were seized. We suffered no casualties.
