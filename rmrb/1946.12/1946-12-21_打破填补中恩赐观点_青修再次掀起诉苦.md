Breaking the Viewpoint of Filling and Bestowing Favors
    Qingxiu Again Launches a Campaign to Pour Out Grievances
    [This newspaper's Taiyue, 16th dispatch] After three days of thorough re-examination of the land reform in Qingxiu Village, Qin County, a new high tide of pouring out grievances has now been launched. At the beginning of the re-examination, some cadres thought: as long as whoever lacks housing, land, food, and clothing is investigated clearly, a list is drawn up, and then part of the fruits of the struggle that were retained and not distributed are distributed to them, then it can fill in the gaps, make up for deficiencies, and cut off the tail of the movement. However, most of the people who lacked land and housing were those who had not fully poured out their grievances. Once examined, their hidden pain was enlightened. Cheng Erchang said: "Last time I wanted to pour out my grievances, someone said he was okay, no need to pour it out. Now that you asked me, I will pour out all my bitterness." Guo Jinmao wore his hat and pants inside out, with a broken cotton-padded coat in the middle, indicating that he had turned over completely on both sides, but still had bitterness in his heart. A total of twenty-five people, whether they had already turned over or not turned over thoroughly, raised new issues. Everyone said: "In the past, the village's anti-traitor, anti-tyrant, rent reduction and interest reduction were just a performance. The liquidation of rent and interest issues was very incomplete." At this point, Qingxiu Village, where the mass movement had been intermittent for a month, was once again filled with the atmosphere of struggle. The masses said: "Now it is truly democratic. Say what is lacking, fill what is missing."

　　打破填补中恩赐观点
    青修再次掀起诉苦
    【本报太岳十六日电】沁县青修村经三天的翻身大检查，现已掀起新的诉苦高潮。检查之初有的干部以为：只要将谁缺房、缺地、缺吃、缺穿调查清楚，开出名单，再把保留未分的一部斗争果实分给他们，便可填平补齐割去运动尾巴，可是缺地缺房的人，大多是未曾吐尽苦水的人，一经检查便启发了他们的隐痛，程二昌说：“上次我要诉苦，有人说他可以了，不用诉了，现在既然问到我，我就要把苦倒尽。”郭金茂将帽子与裤子皆翻着穿戴，中间穿件破棉衣，表示他两头已翻了身，心内仍有苦。不论已经翻了身或是翻的不彻底的人，共有二十五人提出新问题，大家说：“过去村里反奸霸减租息，只是唱了一台戏，对租息问题的清算很不彻底。”至此群众运动间歇一月的青修村，又弥漫着斗争的空气，群众说：“现在真正民主了，缺甚说甚，没甚填甚。”
