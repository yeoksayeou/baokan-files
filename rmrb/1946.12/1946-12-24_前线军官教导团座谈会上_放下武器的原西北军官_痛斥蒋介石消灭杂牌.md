At the Frontline Officer Training Regiment Symposium
    Former Northwest Army Officers Who Laid Down Their Arms
    Denounce Chiang Kai-shek's Elimination of "Miscellaneous Troops"

    [This Newspaper, Jilu Yu Frontline, 23rd Dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek's policy towards "miscellaneous troops" sparked fierce and extremely interesting debates among Chiang army officers who had laid down their arms. While residing at the training regiment, during one discussion on this issue, Northwest Army officers said that the so-called "Three Great Policies" and "Three Gains" of Chiang Kai-shek were prevalent within their Northwest Army. One of the Three Great Policies was "chopping off the head," removing leading figures such as General Feng Yuxiang; the second was "cutting off the tail," not replenishing soldiers who were injured or killed; and the third was "severing the waist," reorganizing and confusing the Northwest Army, causing it to gradually lose its name and substance. The so-called Three Gains were: the Northwest Army eliminating the Eighth Route Army was called an external gain, the Eighth Route Army eliminating the Northwest Army was called an internal gain, and mutual defeat was called an internal and external gain. They said, "Chiang Kai-shek's discrimination against his own direct lineage troops and 'miscellaneous troops' was very obvious. For example, his direct lineage troops had good equipment, while the equipment of our Northwest Army was much worse." At the time, officers from Chiang Kai-shek's 11th Division were present, and some of them defended, saying, "That was due to geographical relations. Our mechanized forces were equipped in India and Burma, and your inland transportation was inconvenient." The Northwest Army officers said, "We fired the first shot at Xifengkou during the War of Resistance against Japan, and we were also called upon to be the vanguard in the civil war. You wear fine broadcloth, but what do we wear? Our padded jackets are half the length of yours. What is the reason for that?" The direct lineage officers had no reason to offer and, out of shame and anger, began to curse, calling the Northwest Army officers "shameless." The Northwest Army officers replied, "If you are so concerned about face, why don't you commit suicide? Didn't your Chairman Chiang say, 'Succeed or die trying'?" Only then did the direct lineage officers look at each other, speechless. Many direct lineage officers were not so wholeheartedly devoted to Chiang Kai-shek, but they did not dare to speak openly at the time. Behind the scenes, they secretly said in a joking tone, "During the Xi'an Incident, Chiang Kai-shek was arrested, and he didn't commit suicide himself!" The day before yesterday, a reporter visited the training regiment and was invited to participate in a symposium. I happened to meet several officers from the "miscellaneous troops" and asked them about the problem of equipment differences. Zhang Kelin, a lieutenant and radio station chief of the 85th Regiment of the 29th Brigade of the 55th Army of the Northwest Army, said, "They say it's a geographical relationship, which is complete nonsense. That year, our 55th Army and 58th Army were stationed in Nanyang, while Tang Enbo was in the Zhengzhou Wuyang area. Trucks loaded with Zhongzheng rifles and Czech-style equipment were sent to them, passing through our garrison. If it's about geographical relations, why weren't we given any, since we were closer? If it weren't for our Northwest Army, we would have been captured by the enemy long ago, but Chen Cheng and his people treated us like this." The Chiang Kai-shek military academy system's exclusion of "miscellaneous" officers from non-military backgrounds also made them deeply resentful. Shen Han, a clerk in the regimental headquarters of the 9th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Division, said, "When the 3rd Division was reorganized last year, officers from non-military backgrounds were not allowed to be retained. Wang Xin, a Guangdong native and battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of the 9th Regiment, who had outstanding combat achievements and had been in the 3rd Division for fifteen years, had finally worked his way up to battalion commander, but he was dismissed because of this. His wife was sick, and he had already overdrawn 50,000 yuan. When he left with no money, he said in tears, 'The War of Resistance against Japan was won, and the people did not become slaves to the foreign country, but we non-military officers have become slaves to our own!' But these Whampoa Military Academy students cannot fight. This time, when the 3rd Division was annihilated, very few military academy students were injured, and many escaped." The supply company commander of the 112th Brigade of the 41st Sichuan Army said, "They have connections with the military academy, so it doesn't matter if they escape. Fighting relies on the old non-military officers, and becoming an official relies on Whampoa graduates. Those who are officials are officials, those who are getting shelled are getting shelled, and those who are getting rich are getting rich. Everyone has a share, and it's all clearly divided!" These words caused a burst of laughter.

　　前线军官教导团座谈会上
    放下武器的原西北军官
    痛斥蒋介石消灭杂牌
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十三日电】蒋介石对杂牌军的政策，在放下武器的蒋军军官中发生激烈而极有趣味的辩论。他们住在教导团，内有一次谈到这个问题时，西北军官们说他们西北军中就流行着蒋介石的所谓“三大政策”与“三得”之说。三大政策之一的削头，把冯玉祥将军等领袖人物去掉；二为去尾，士兵伤亡了不补充；三为截腰，把西北军缩编编乱，使之慢慢地名实俱亡。所谓三得就是西北军把八路消灭了谓之外得，八路军把西北军消灭了谓之内得，两败俱伤谓之内外兼得。他们说：“蒋介石对他的嫡系与杂牌军的歧视，是很明显的，譬如他的嫡系装备就好，我们西北军的装备就坏得多。”当时在座的，有蒋介石嫡系十一师的军官，他们之中有人辩护说：“那是地理关系，我们的机械化武装，是在印缅装备的，你们在内地交通不便”。西北军说：“抗战是我们在喜峰口打第一炮、内战又叫我们打先锋，你们穿的是细洋布，我们穿的是什么？我们的袄子比你们短半截，又是什么道理？”嫡系军官无理可说，恼羞成怒，便破口大骂，说西北军官“不要脸”。西北军官回答说：“你这样要脸，为什么不自杀？你们蒋主席不是说：‘不成功便成仁’吗？”嫡系们这才面面相视，哑口无言。也有许多嫡系军官对蒋介石并不是那样死心塌地，但当时不敢开口，背后才偷偷的以开玩笑的口吻说：“西安事变时，蒋介石被捕，他自己也没自杀哩！”前天记者参观教导团，被邀参加一个座谈会，碰到几位杂牌军的军官，顺便问问装备差异的问题，西北军五十五军二十九旅八十五团的电台台长张克伶中尉说：“他们说那是地理关系，完全是瞎说，那年我们五十五军和五十八军驻在南阳，汤恩伯在郑州舞阳一带，汽车载着中正式和捷克式的装备送给他们，从我们驻地经过，你说地理关系，我们近为什么反而不给？要不是我们西北军，早给敌人俘去了，可是陈诚他们却是这样对付我们”。蒋介石军校系统排挤行伍出身的杂牌军官，也深使他们愤慨。三师三旅九团团部的司书沈汗说：“去年三师整编时，校官不准留用行伍，九团一营营长广东人王新，卓著战功，在三师十五年，好容易熬到一个营长，也因此去职，他老婆病了，早已透支了五万元，走时身无分钱，当他流泪而去时，他说抗战胜利了，老百姓没有当亡国奴，是我们行伍当了亡国奴了！但是这些黄埔学生并不能打仗，这次三师被歼，军校学生受伤的很少，逃跑的也很多”。川军四十一师一一二旅输送连连长说：“他们有军校关系，逃回去也不要紧，打仗靠老行伍，当官靠黄埔；在那边当官的是当官的，挨炮的是挨炮的，发财的是发财的，各人都有一份，分得清清楚楚！”这话说的哄堂大笑。
