"Chiang Kai-shek Abandoned Us, But the Eighth Route Army Healed Our Wounds"
Wounded Chiang Soldiers Vow to Oppose Civil War

[Report from the JiluYu Frontline Reporters Group, this newspaper, 10th] More than 460 Chiang army officers and soldiers wounded in the Hua County battle have been transferred by stretcher and cart to the rear field hospital. The comrades in charge of the recuperation company personally visit and check their wounds every day, and the nurses take care of their diet and daily life with enthusiasm. In the freezing weather, Cui Mingfu, the squad leader of the Recuperation Company's Ninth Squad, personally washed blood-stained clothes for the wounded Chiang soldiers. Zeng Jiagui, a soldier from the 104th Brigade, didn't want to eat anything, so Long Zhusheng, the squad leader of the Eighth Squad, personally went to the market and bought noodles for him with his own money. Thanks to timely treatment and meticulous care, in just ten days, 42 of the 180 wounded Chiang soldiers in one hospital have fully recovered. The suspicion and fear that some wounded Chiang soldiers had at the beginning have completely disappeared. Weng Zhenmin, a messenger from the 25th Brigade headquarters, said excitedly: "Chiang Kai-shek asked us to be cannon fodder, and when we were injured, he threw us away like cattle and horses. The Eighth Route Army comrades treated our wounds. I can't wait for my wounds to heal quickly so I can resolutely join the Eighth Route Army, do a good job, and vent my hatred." At a mass rally held by the villagers to welcome and comfort them, Li Xianzhi, from the Third Battalion Headquarters of the 311th Regiment of the 124th Brigade, spoke on behalf of all the rescued wounded Chiang soldiers. He said: "Now everyone understands that our pain was given to us by Old Chiang. When we attacked the Liberated Areas, the people in the Liberated Areas even comforted us, which is really shameful. When our wounds are healed, we will resolutely stand on the side of the people, resolutely stand with the Eighth Route Army, and oppose Old Chiang's civil war." (Li Wen)

    “蒋介石丢咱不管八路军给咱医伤”
      蒋伤员誓反内战
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十日电】四百六十多个滑县战役中负伤的蒋军官兵，已由担架大车转运至后方野战医院。休养连的负责同志，每日亲自慰问和给他们检查伤口，看护员们热心的照顾着他们的饮食起居。已是结冰的天气了，休养连九班长崔明甫亲自给蒋军伤员洗血衣。一○四旅的一个战士曾家桂不想吃东西，八班长龙柱生同志亲自跑到集上用自己的钱给他买挂面吃。由于医治及时，照顾周到，虽只十天的工夫，仅一所一百八十名蒋军伤员中，即有四十二个人已完全痊愈。开始时一些蒋军伤员们存在着的怀疑和恐惧，至此已完全消失，二五旅旅部传令兵翁振民很激动的说：“蒋介石叫咱当炮灰，受伤了又像牛马一样扔掉不管，八路同志却给咱们医伤，我巴不得伤口赶快好，坚决参加八路军，好好干一场，泄一泄心头之恨”。在驻村的群众慰问欢迎大会上，一二四旅三一一团三营营部的李先智，代表全体得救的蒋军伤员讲话，他说：“现下大家都明白了，我们的痛苦是老蒋给我们的，我们进攻解放区，解放区的老百姓还慰问我们，实在惭愧。伤口好了，我们都坚决站在人民立场上，坚决和八路军在一起，反对老蒋打内战。”（力文）
