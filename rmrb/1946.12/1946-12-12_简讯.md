    Brief News
    Continuing Book and Newspaper Support for the Troops
    
    ★The book and newspaper support for the troops movement is continuing to unfold. The Taihang Third Prefectural Committee and Licheng No. 1 High School enthusiastically donated funds for books to support the troops. After the Third Prefectural Committee initiated a campaign on the 24th of last month to express sympathy with books and newspapers for the "Hua-Pu Victory," the few comrades remaining in the organs donated 4,050 yuan for books. Cook Guo Zhifu, lacking books or money, offered the two bars of soap he had saved, asking others to exchange them for books to send to the front lines. Fu Ji, a female student from Licheng No. 1 High School, in addition to donating books, also thoughtfully wrote a letter of condolence to the Eighth Route Army at the front. The entire school, consisting of 149 students, donated a total of 110 books and periodicals, and 7,300 yuan in book funds. The young students also organized a "Book and Newspaper Support for the Troops Fundraising Team" to mobilize all sectors of the city to donate books, which will be forwarded to the front lines in batches.

    Taiyue Post Office Increases Postal Routes

    ★The Taiyue Postal Administration Bureau has increased postal routes and improved remittance services to meet the needs of the war. The bureau convened a meeting of post office and station chiefs from the entire region on the 13th of last month, where they enthusiastically discussed how to strengthen postal speed, ensure the safety of delivery, and open up new trunk line remittance services. The following was decided: (1) A new trunk line will be established from Ji Shi to Hechuan; (2) In addition to strictly implementing mail handover, changing the past practice of distributing mail along the stations to direct sealing, and implementing a segmented management system, in order to ensure smooth financial flow, remittance operations will be expanded. As of November 21st, 20 county bureaus have begun inter-bank transfers. In addition, mutual remittance is possible in all areas where our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region government is present. The remittance fee rate is 4% for amounts below 1,000 yuan, 2% for amounts above 1,000 yuan, and 1% for amounts above 10,000 yuan. Remittances are available immediately upon arrival. The post office is responsible for compensation in case of loss.

        Taihang No. 8 Middle School Reorganizes Structure

    ★Due to the large-scale invasion of the Daqing Line by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, more than 200 students from our Taihang No. 8 Middle School and Bo'ai County Junior Middle School were transferred to ×× on October 10th to form the Taihang Fourth Military Region Joint Middle School. All teachers and students personally participated, and the school buildings have been completed. In order to adapt to the current situation, all students are divided into three teams: the vocational team is directly integrated with the factory, with two hours of textile study per day; the middle school team focuses on improving culture; and the general cadre team specializes in political study and is currently studying "On the War Situation." They are also preparing to organize propaganda teams and drama troupes to work in the countryside.

    书报劳军
    继续开展
    ★书报劳军运动正继续开展，太行三地委及黎城一高热烈捐献劳军书款。三地委于上月二十四日发起以书报慰问“滑濮之捷”的战役后，仅留机关的少数同志即献出四千零五十元书款。炊事员郭志富没有书、钱，把他早存下的两条肥皂献出来，叫别人给换成书寄往前线。黎城一高女生福继除献书外，还用心给前线八路军写了一封慰问信。全校同学共一百四十九名，共捐书刊一百一十册，书款七千三百元。小同学们并组织起“书报劳军劝募队”到城关各街动员各界献书，分期转寄前线。
