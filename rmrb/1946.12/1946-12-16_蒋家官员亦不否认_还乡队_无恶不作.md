Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 13th: Even personnel within the Jiang government cannot help but admit to the crimes of the Jiang-controlled "Returning Home Corps" [还乡队], which include robbery, arson, and murder. An editorial in the Tianjin Dagongbao on November 25th quoted Shao Hongji, a member of the Kuomintang Hebei Provincial Government Committee, after inspecting eastern Hebei: “Fifty percent of the 'Returning Home Corps' are scattered soldiers and vagrants, as well as eliminated puppet troops. Forty percent of the puppet secret service personnel are determined to return home for revenge. Therefore, 'Returning Home Corps' members are generally unable to fight. They are especially unable to maintain discipline, and taking revenge on grudges only creates disputes. For example, if fifty jin of peanuts were seized during the spring purge, now five hundred jin are demanded in compensation. The private abduction and detention by various counties are already commonplace. As for selling land and forcibly reclaiming it, muddling the waters to illegally occupy property, these are even more common." The editorial also revealed that the crimes of the "Returning Home Corps" in the Jin-Cha-Ji area [晋察冀, Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region] have been extremely opposed by the people, so much so that Fu Zuoyi had no choice but to incorporate the "Returning Home Corps" into the regular army in an attempt to ease popular anger. The Beiping Daily also published an editorial on the 24th calling for the disbandment of the "Returning Home Corps," excerpting an open letter from a reader in Zhangjiakou "to the Combat Daily," expressing infinite hatred for the "Returning Home Corps." He said: "During the Mengjiang era [Mongolian Border Region under Japanese control], you ate the flesh and drank the blood of the Chinese people, and brutally harmed countless Chinese lives. When Japan surrendered, you saw the situation was not good and left without saying goodbye. Now that the National Army has arrived, you have also arrived, and I don't know what your intentions are? And unscrupulous civil and military officials are actually using the 'Returning Home Corps' as henchmen and lackeys, colluding with each other to oppress the good and bully the people, taking revenge on grudges and illegally occupying property."

### 蒋家官员亦不否认“还乡队”无恶不作

　　蒋家官员亦不否认“还乡队”无恶不作
    【新华社延安十三日电】蒋记“还乡队”抢夺、烧、杀无恶不作的罪行，即蒋政府人员亦不得不承认。天津大公报十一月二十五日社论中引国民党冀省府委员邵鸿基在视察冀东后的谈话称：“还乡队”中百分之五十为散兵游勇，及被淘汰的伪军。伪特务人员百分之四十志在回乡报复，故“还乡队员”大抵不能作战。尤不易守纪律，而挟嫌报复徒滋纠纷。例如今年春被清算五十斤花生，现需补偿五百斤。而各县私掳拘捕等情事，已经司空见惯。至于出售地强行收回，浑水摸鱼非法占有，尤属屡见不鲜。该社论并透露在晋察冀方面“还乡队”的罪行，遭受人民极端反对。致傅作义亦不得不将“还乡队”编入正规军，以图缓和人民愤怒。北平日报亦于二十四日要求解散“还乡队”的社论中摘引张家口一读者“致战斗日报”的公开信，对“还乡队”表示无限憎恶。他说：在蒙疆时代，你们吃中国人的肉，喝中国人的血，惨害了无数中国人的生命。日本投降了，你们看势不好，竟不辞而别。现在国军来了，你们也来了，不知有何贵干？而不肖文武官吏，竟用“还乡队”作爪牙鹰犬，互相勾结，欺压善良，鱼肉百姓，挟嫌报复非法占有。
