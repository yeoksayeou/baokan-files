　　Insights into the Prospects for Next Year's International Situation
    The International Situation After the Two Major Conferences in New York
    The first session of the United Nations General Assembly and the New York Foreign Ministers Conference have concluded. There are still three months until the next meeting of the four major foreign ministers in Moscow. The development of several events in the past week has provided insights into the prospects for the Moscow conference and even the international situation next year.

    Many signs indicate that the British and American authorities are engaging in various diplomatic maneuvers. After British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned to London on the same ship as Molotov on the 5th, the British Cabinet immediately met to discuss the Labor Party members of Parliament's criticism of foreign policy last mid-month. Previously, the British Labor Party Foreign Affairs Committee had suggested that the government reform the Foreign Office and strive for the influence of professional diplomats following Conservative Party policies. At the same time, the British House of Commons decided to invite a delegation from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to visit Britain.

    In the United States, after the so-called "tough policy towards the Soviet Union" was exposed and failed at the two major conferences in New York, Republican Senator Vandenberg, the pillar of this policy and inseparable from Byrnes since the San Francisco Conference, has announced that he will not accompany Byrnes to the Moscow Conference. According to a report by Agence France-Presse, after the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, "the US government is now more inclined to grant loans to the Soviet Union than before." This phenomenon is clearly based on the current and near-future economic situation in the United States. According to a Reuters report, the United States is currently experiencing "relative overproduction," and this will worsen next year. By next autumn, "the urgency of the United States' attempt to sell its products through loans or any other means may be greater than the willingness of its target countries to purchase these products."

    Among the British and American diplomatic developments this week, it is worth noting that most involve Eastern issues. These include the Indian issue, one of the focal points of Anglo-American contradictions. At his first press conference after returning to Washington from New York, Byrnes reiterated his "concern" about the situation in India. US Undersecretary of State Acheson also met with Indian representative Menon on the same day. This event, which occurred after the breakdown of negotiations between the Indian National Congress and the British on constitutional issues, has attracted attention from all parties.

    In addition, Truman issued a statement on the China issue on the 18th (a separate article will comment on Truman's statement - editor); after the British business delegation returned to Britain from China, it was decided to send a parliamentary delegation to China next autumn. An agreement has been reached on the issue of the United States and the Soviet Union repatriating Japanese from the Soviet Union. The US authorities in Korea have proposed that the US side wishes to resume the Seoul Conference, and the Soviet side has indicated its agreement to convene the conference on the condition of abiding by the December Moscow Conference's decision on the Korean issue.

    All of these events occurred after the two major conferences in New York and before the Moscow Conference, which is obviously not accidental. (December 21st)

### 展望来年国际局势的启示  纽约两大会议后的国际局势

　　展望来年国际局势的启示
    纽约两大会议后的国际局势
    联合国首届大会与纽约外长会议已告结束，从现在到下一次四强外长在莫斯科重聚，尚有三个月之久。一周来若干事件的发展，提供了展望莫斯科会议以至来年国际局势的启示。
    许多征象显示英美当局正作各种外交策划。与莫洛托夫同轮五日的英外相贝文返抵伦敦后，英内阁即集会讨论上月中旬下院工党议员抨击外交政策的问题。前次英工党外交委员会曾建议政府改革外交部，争取保守党政策影响的职业外交家；同时英下院又决定邀请苏联最高苏维埃派代表团访英。
    在美国，于纽约两大会议中暴露所谓“对苏强硬政策”的真相及其失败后，作为这一政策的支柱并自旧金山会议以后和贝纳斯形影不离的共和党参议员范登堡已宣布不陪伴贝氏出席莫斯科会议。而据法国新闻社记者报导，在四强外长会议后，“美政府已较前倾向于允诺对苏贷款”。这种现象，显然是以目前及最近将来的美国经济情况为背景。据路透社记者报导，目前美国“已相对的生产过剩”，明年更甚。明秋“美国企图借贷款或其他任何方法来推销其产品的要求，其迫切程度，可能甚于其对象国购买这些产品的愿望。”
    一周来英美外交动态中值得注意者，为多数牵涉东方问题。其中包括英美矛盾焦点之一的印度问题。贝纳斯于自纽约归返华府的首次记者招待会上，就重申对印度局势的“关切”。而美副国务卿亚泽逊亦于同日接见印代表梅农，此事适发生于印国大党与英方对制宪问题谈判破裂之后，已引起各方注意。
    此外，杜鲁门于十八日发表关于中国问题的声明（对杜氏声明当另文评述——编者）；英方于商务访华团返英后，又决定明秋派议会访华团来华。美苏遣送苏境日人返国问题已达协议。朝鲜美当局提出美方欲恢复汉城会议，苏方已表示在遵守去年十二月莫斯科会议关于朝鲜问题的决定的条件下，同意召开。
    凡此等等，均发生于纽约两大会议之后与莫斯科会议之前，显然不是偶然的。（十二月二十一日）
