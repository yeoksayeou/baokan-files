　　The "He Zhu" Unit Sends Captured Soldiers Home
    Giving Travel Expenses and Provisions, Chiang's Captured Soldiers Shed Tears of Gratitude
    [Our newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 1st dispatch] The Sixth Prisoner of War Reception Center of our "He Zhu" unit recently released 146 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who laid down their weapons in the Juan Cheng battle to return home. Before their departure, they were given a farewell dinner, and each person was issued between 1,500 and 3,000 legal tender, three catties of provisions, and a release certificate. When they received these items, they thought of how they had been driven by the American lackey Chiang Kai-shek to the civil war front to be cannon fodder, and how they had received preferential treatment after being liberated by the Eighth Route Army. Today, they are able to return home for a happy reunion. A wave of joy and sorrow washed over them, and many people shed tears." Soldier Zhang Fengming of the 356th Regiment said, "When I go back, the Baozhang [local security chief] will want to grab us to be conscripted again. That bastard, I'll smash his head with a stone." Jiang Yueping, a messenger of the 5th Company of the 86th Regiment of the 55th Division, said, "Chiang Kai-shek pushed us into the gates of hell, while the Eighth Route Army pulled us back to the road of life. This kind of rebirth grace, I can never forget until I die." When they were about to leave, they were reluctant to part and raised their hands to the farewell personnel and shouted: "Go back, comrades! We will never forget you, even in death."
    [Our newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Frontline Reporter Group, 1st dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek is preparing for a long-term civil war and is actively conducting anti-communist and anti-people ideological education, ordering every officer and soldier to be familiar with the "Bandit Suppression Handbook" in order to use them as cannon fodder in the civil war. In the Battle of Juancheng, our army seized Chiang's army commander Cao Fulin's "bandit suppression" instruction from Xuchang on September 28, which stated: "The Chairman's Bandit Suppression Handbook, all levels of our officers must explain to the soldiers in detail, so that they can read it thoroughly, everyone can understand it, and implement it effectively. If there is any failure to implement it, the chief officer will be held accountable." (Li Yi)

　　和主部遣俘回家
    赠路费发给养蒋俘感激落泪
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】我“和主”部队第六俘虏收容所近释放鄄城战役放下武器的蒋军士兵一百四十六人回家。行前会餐，每人发给法币一千五百元到三千元，给养三斤及释放证一纸。他们把东西接到手里，想起了被美国走狗蒋介石驱逐到内战前线险些当了炮灰，被八路军解放后受优待，今天更能回家好好团圆，于是一阵高兴、一阵心酸、许多人都潸然泪下”。三五六团士兵张凤鸣说：“回去保长要再抓咱们壮丁，王八蛋不弄石头砸了他的脑袋。”五五师八六团五连传令兵蒋越平说：“蒋介石把俺们往阎王殿里推，八路军把我们往活路上拉，这种再生之恩，到死也不能忘记。”他们临行时恋恋不舍，对我欢送人员举手高呼：“请回吧，同志们！我们死也忘不了你们。”
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团一日电】蒋介石准备长期内战，积极进行反共反人民思想教育，命令每个官兵必须熟读“剿共手本。”以便给他充当内战炮灰。我军在鄄城战役缴获蒋军军长曹福林九月二十八日在许昌之“剿匪”训令称：“委员长剿匪手本，我各级长官对士兵务应详细讲解，使之熟读，人人体会，确切实行，如有奉行不力，以各主官是问。”（力以）
