　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: A dispatch from Tehran reports that since the 4th of this month, Iranian government troops have launched a civil war, invading Azerbaijan territory. In the past two weeks, they have occupied several towns in Azerbaijan Province. Premier Sultani recently issued a statement, preposterously claiming that he would "strangle all Azerbaijan Democratic Party members" and announced the cancellation of the Azerbaijan Province Democratic Autonomous Government. The Sultani government dares to launch a civil war because it has foreign backing. According to the Tehran "Bashar" newspaper, since November 22nd, the United States has transferred forty four-engine bombers to the Iranian government army. The people of Azerbaijan Province are extremely indignant about this and are launching guerrilla warfare in various places. The Central Committee of the Masses Party issued a declaration on the 16th, denouncing the government for using "negotiations" with the Azerbaijan Autonomous Government as a cover to arrange a civil war and anti-democratic measures. It stated: "At present, the last vestige of democracy in Iran has disappeared." The declaration announced that the Masses Party refuses to participate in parliamentary elections. The declaration also stated that the Masses Party is now a large national party, and if truly free elections are held, the Masses Party will win nationwide victory. The strength of the Masses Party can be seen in the recent large-scale strike of hundreds of thousands of workers led by the party in Kurdistan.

　　美国给伊朗政府飞机
    帮助反动派打内战
    阿省人民极为愤恨正展开游击
    群众党声明拒绝参加国会选举
    【新华社延安二十二日电】德黑兰讯：自本月四日起，伊朗政府军即发动内战，侵入阿塞拜疆境内。两周来侵占阿省若干城镇。总理苏尔坦尼于日前发表声明，妄言要“绞杀一切阿塞拜疆民主党人”，并宣布取消阿省民主自治政府。苏尔坦尼政府之所以敢于发动内战，乃因有外国在背后撑腰。据德黑兰“巴夏尔”报称：自十一月二十二日起，美国将四十架四引擎轰炸机让与伊朗政府军队，阿省人民对此极为愤恨，正在各地展开游击战。群众党中央委员会于十六日发表宣言，痛斥政府利用和阿省自治政府“谈判”作掩护，布置内战与反民主措置。据称：“目前在伊朗民主的最后一点残余已消失了。”该宣言宣布，群众党拒绝参加国会选举。宣言又称：群众党现已是全国性的大党，如果举行真正的自由选举，群众党将在全国获得胜利。群众党的力量，可由最近以前在库基斯坦领导的数十万工人大罢工中见之。
