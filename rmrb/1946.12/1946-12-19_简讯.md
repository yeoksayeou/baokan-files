    The Taihang Second Middle School's Normal Class has designated December as a month for professional study. The main focus of study is to assist the masses in old liberated areas with rent reduction, followed by establishing winter schools. The latter will be initiated or improved through mass mobilization. Students departed on the 5th of this month to begin work in nineteen villages and towns in Zuoquan and Heshun. Upon departure, the students expressed confidence: "We must, through this practical learning, train ourselves into revolutionary educators." (Ren Jinlin, Guo Sijun)
    The masses in the Jidian village of Bo'ai Hankao City, while supporting the front lines, are also intensifying winter production. Despite being located near the border and facing heavy wartime duties, they opened a new coal mine half a month ago, producing approximately 5,000 jin of coal per day. Additionally, the Dada and Xuantanmiao coal mines are being vigorously developed and will soon start producing coal. All the coal they produce is sold at a low price of one yuan per jin to nearby troops for fuel. (Liu He)
    New recruits forcibly conscripted by Yan Xishan's puppet troops in Yuci, unable to bear the oppression of their officers, are deserting in large numbers. According to soldiers who recently escaped to our area, the food situation in Yan Xishan's puppet army in Yuci is extremely dire. They seize whatever they can eat, and after further deductions by officers, each soldier only receives ten liang of rice and two liang of flour per day. They are subjected to beatings and starvation, locked up at night, and guarded by sentries in the courtyard and on the roof. However, even the sentries are deserting due to unbearable hunger. Before each departure, they fire shots into the sky, indicating extreme war-weariness. In the past three months, out of the thousand-plus new recruits forcibly conscripted by Yan Xishan in Yuci, only over three hundred remain after desertions.
    The Taihang Federation of Literary and Art Circles recently received four sums of remuneration for consoling the troops, totaling 2,650 yuan: 1,500 yuan from comrades Jie Yun, etc., of the Guangming Drama Troupe, 500 yuan from Comrade Shan Ren, 500 yuan from Comrade Tian Sheng, and 150 yuan from Comrade Guan Ping, a teacher at Taihang Second Middle School. The total sum of 2,650 yuan has been handed over to the Political Department of the Military Region for forwarding to the soldiers at the front. (Yue Chun)

    太行二中师范班，定十二月为业务学习月。以到农村帮助老区群众查减为主要学习内容，其次是兴办冬学。而后者又以通过群运去开办或改进，各同学已于本月五号出发至左权、和顺的十九个村镇开始工作。出发时各同学都有信心的表示：“一定要在这次实际的学习中锻炼成革命的教育工作者”。（任锦林、郭思俊）
    博爱汉高城基点村群众，一面支援前线，一面加紧冬季生产。他们虽地邻边境，战勤繁重，仍于半月前新开煤窑一座，日产煤五千斤左右。另大底、玄坛庙两煤窑亦正大力开拓，不日即将出煤。他们所出之煤，均按一元钱一斤廉价出售给附近部队烧用。（刘荷）
    榆次阎伪抢抓之新兵不堪官长压迫纷纷逃亡，据最近逃来我区之士兵谈：榆次阎伪军食粮极感恐慌，抢下啥吃啥，再经过官长从中克扣，每天每个战士只能吃到十两米，二两面，受打受饿，夜间被锁入屋内，院里房上哨兵看守，但哨兵亦因无法忍饿而趁机逃亡。每次出发，即朝天打枪，厌战情绪极高。三个月来榆次阎伪所抓之千余新兵逃跑只剩三百余人。
