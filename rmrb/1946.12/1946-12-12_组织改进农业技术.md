Organize to Improve Agricultural Technology

In the old liberated areas, after the rent reduction and interest rate reduction campaigns and the "land to the tiller" movement of recent years, the broad masses of peasants have obtained land. From now on, how to improve agricultural technology to increase production has become their urgent demand!

Improving agricultural technology has been advocated in the Taihang area for several years, and the Border Region Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has trained many agricultural cadres for this purpose. However, how to organize the masses to implement agricultural technology in every important agricultural activity is still an important task at present. Since counties such as Lucheng, Licheng, Wuxiang, and Zuoquan have successively organized Agricultural Technology Research Committees, they have made considerable achievements in organizing the masses to improve agricultural technology. Some county-level technology research committees have gradually become mass organizations. Some villages in Li and Lu completed this year's "three years of planting, one year in surplus," and technical guidance played a considerable role. The Agricultural Technology Research Committee has become the most powerful grass-roots organization for improving agricultural technology. Now, in Lucheng County alone, agricultural technology research committees have been established in 82 villages, and 86 villages in the new district are being organized. Many farmers in Lucheng did not know how to grow cotton. During this year's cotton planting campaign, the Technical Committee helped the masses solve many technical difficulties, so the cotton seedlings in many old areas emerged very well, ensuring that the cotton fields were hoeed three times, and organizing everyone to learn cotton boll opening, pruning, and topping. Now, women and children in many villages have mastered this important cotton planting technology. This year, when the weather was dry in June, many cotton fields suffered from "oil drought," and the cotton seedlings were about to be damaged. The Technical Committee immediately studied and promoted agents and methods for treating "oil drought," such as using tobacco leaf water, star fruit leaf root water, old ash from roof beams, and wheat bran water; moreover, it mobilized everyone to destroy ant nests when hoeing cotton, so that ants could not live with the "oil drought" and harm the cotton. As a result, many cotton seedlings were spared from insect pests. According to Lucheng's original plan to plant 30,000 mu of cotton this year, thanks to the publicity and guidance of the Technical Committee, not only was the task successfully completed, but also 5,700 mu more were planted, exceeding the original plan by 19 percent, which greatly increased the yield. In some villages in the new district of Lucheng, because there was no Technical Committee, the cotton fields were not prepared well, and the soil cover was too deep when planting, resulting in a shortage of seedlings. During the wheat harvesting season of No. 169 in Lucheng, farmers were first mobilized to pull out miscellaneous ears and diseased ears in the fields; after harvesting, women and children were organized to select ears; when threshing, the No. 169 wheat was threshed separately, and divided into first, second, and third grades according to the different colors of the wheat seeds. The Agricultural and Forestry Bureau originally planned to collect 100,000 catties of wheat seeds in Lucheng. Thanks to the active help of the Technical Committee, 110,000 catties were collected, which played a great role in breeding superior seeds. In addition, before the general wheat harvest, many villages in Lucheng carried out seed selection work under the promotion of the Technical Committee. In order to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage, the Lucheng Technical Committee studied a quick method of composting soil fertilizer with wheat straw and planting green manure with beans in wheat stubble fields. Lucheng has suffered from the enemy's cruel plunder in recent years, and livestock power is very scarce, making plowing difficult. The Technical Committee has invented various types of human-pulled plows, which have solved great difficulties for the whole county! For example, the new type of human-pulled plow created in Beicun can plow five mu of land per day by two people. In addition, the human-pulled plows and hoes invented by Shichang, Dongjia Village, etc. are also more suitable. The Agricultural Technology Research Committee of Licheng has developed quite rapidly from last year to the present. At present, a total of 137 Technical Committees in the county are studying agricultural technology in various villages, and have created many valuable experiences in weeding wheat, planting cotton, selecting seeds, and applying fertilizer.

The reason why the Technical Committees in Lucheng, Licheng and other counties can play a considerable role in this year's large-scale production movement is mainly because they organized the native-born technical experts, used their practical experience to improve them, and then had new achievements and creations.

The Agricultural Technology Research Committee is a lower-level organization for improving agricultural technology, and the leadership should provide multi-faceted assistance to this organization at present. We should learn from Lucheng and Licheng to transform and rectify the ineffective technical research committees in various places. In addition, it is also necessary to organize universally and systematically in villages in the liberated areas with a foundation for mass work.

How to organize and lead the Agricultural Technology Research Committee are issues worth studying. The organization of Licheng is as follows: The whole county first opened an agricultural technology training class, which was divided into cotton planting, wasteland reclamation, tree planting, indigo planting, warm water seed soaking, etc., and trained a total of 342 people. Then, with these people as the core, various forms of Technical Committees were organized. This year, the shortcomings of the Technical Committee last year were addressed and rectified. For example, Qiushuyuan Village in the Third District selected nine people with rich agricultural experience based on mutual aid groups to form the Technical Committee, and equipped them with capable village cadres to participate in organizing and leading, and held meetings to study according to the agricultural season. Some are organized around labor heroes, such as Shi Cunjin in Huojia Kiln and Dong Taoqi in Wangjiazhuang. Some organize various experts to study and guide according to various agricultural seasons.

    组织改进农业技术
    在老解放区，经过了减租减息和年来的耕者有其田运动，广大农民已获得土地。今后，如何改进农业技术以增加生产，就成为他们目前的迫切要求！
    改进农业技术，在太行区已提倡了数年，边区农林局为此曾训练了不少农业干部。但是，如何组织群众把农业技术贯彻到每一个重要农事活动中，在当前还是件重要的工作。自从潞城、黎城、武乡、左权等县，纷纷组织了农业技术研究委员会以来，在组织群众改进农业技术上，做出不少成绩。有些县技术研究委员会，逐渐变成了群众性的组织，黎、潞有些村庄完成今年的“耕三余一”，技术指导起了相当作用。农业技术研究委员会，成为改进农业技术最有力的基层组织。现在，仅潞城一县，已建立了八十二个村的农业技术研究委员会，在新区还有八十六个村正在组织。潞城有很多农民还不会种棉，在今年植棉运动中，技术委员会帮助群众解决了很多技术上的困难问题，所以老区很多棉苗出的很好，保证了棉田全锄了三遍，并组织大家学习棉花脱裤、打杈和去顶。现在，很多村的妇女和儿童，都掌握了这一重要的植棉技术。在今年六月天旱时，很多棉田生了油旱，眼看着就要吃坏棉苗，技术委员会，马上研究和推广治油旱的药剂和方法，如采用烟叶水、杨桃叶根水、房梁上陈灰、麦糠水等；并且，还发动大家在锄棉时破坏蚂蚁窝，使蚂蚁不能和油旱共同生活害棉花，结果很多棉苗都免去虫害。按潞城今年原计划植棉三万亩，因为有了技委会的宣传和指导，不但胜利的完成了任务，而且还多种了五千七百亩，超过原计划百分之十九，使产量上大有增加。在潞城新区有些村庄，因为没有技委会，结果棉田就没整好土地，种时盖土也深，形成了缺苗现象。潞城当一六九小麦收割时期，先动员农民到地里拔杂穗和病穗；收割后，又组织妇女儿童进行穗选；打场时，又把一六九小麦分开去打，根据麦种不同的成色，分成一、二、三等，农林局原计划在潞城收十万斤麦种，因为有了技委会的积极帮助，就收了十一万斤，在繁殖优良种籽上起了很大作用。另外，一般小麦收割前，潞城有不少村庄在技委会推动下进行了选种工作。为了解决肥料困难问题，潞城的技委会，研究用麦秸沤土粪的快办法及用豆子在麦茬地种绿肥等。潞城几年来，经过敌人残酷掠夺，畜力非常缺乏，犁地常感困难，技委会发明了各样的人拉犁，给全县解决很大困难！如北村创造的新式人拉犁，两人一天就可犁五亩地。此外，史场、东家村等发明的人拉犁和锄、这也较适用。黎城的农业技术研究委员会，从去年到现在发展相当快，目前全县共有一百三十七个技委会正在各村研究农业技术，在锄麦、种棉、选种、施肥等农作上，都创造出很多宝贵经验。
    潞城、黎城等县技委会在今年大规模生产运动中所以能起到相当的作用，主要是把土生土长的技术能手组织起来，利用他们的实际经验加以提高，才有了新的成绩和创造。
    农业技术研究委员会，是改进农业技术的下层组织，目前在领导上应当多方面去帮助这种组织。应该学习潞城、黎城把各地不起作用的技术研究委员会加以改造与整顿。另外，在解放区群众工作有基础的村庄，也需要普遍有计划的去组织。
    农业技术研究委员会如何组织？如何领导？都是值得研究的问题。黎城的组织经过是这样：全县先开了农业技术训练班，内分种棉、薰荒、植树、种蓝、温汤浸种等，共训练了三百四十二人，然后以这些人为核心，组织了各种不同形式的技委会，今年又针对着去年技委会的缺点，并加以整顿，如三区秋树垣村以互助组为基础，选出富有农业经验的九人组织技委会，并配备能力较强的村干部参加，负责组织领导，按农事季节开会研究。有的以劳动英雄为核心组织之，如霍家窑有石寸金、王家庄有董桃气。有的按各个农事季节，组织各种能手研究指导。
