　　The Destruction of 110,000 Chiang Kai-shek Troops

　　In July, Chiang Kai-shek, with the aid of American imperialism, dispatched 22 armies (including 7 American-equipped divisions), a total of 50 brigades, to launch a full-scale offensive against the Jiluyu Liberated Area, dreaming of realizing his arrogant plan to "eliminate Liu Bocheng's main force." However, the facts of the past four months have proven that it was not Liu Bocheng's main force that was eliminated, but Chiang Kai-shek's 110,000 troops.

　　On the Jiluyu Plain, the ever-victorious People's Army under the command of the brilliant strategist General Liu Bocheng, successively fought five major annihilation battles along the Longhai Railway, at Dayang Lake, Longqiang, Juancheng, and recently in Puyang and Hua County, wiping out ten and a half brigades of the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops, totaling more than 70,000 men, including the entire Chiang Kai-shek's directly controlled 3rd Division and more than 6,000 men of the American-equipped 11th Division.

　　Along the Tongpu Railway, the Eighth Route Army under the command of General Chen Geng wiped out more than one brigade of Hu Zongnan's troops in Wenxi; while liberating the five counties of Hongdong, Zhaocheng, etc., in the central section of Tongpu, they annihilated two brigades of Yan Xishan's troops; in Fushan, they also wiped out the American-equipped 1st Brigade (formerly the 1st Division), Chiang Kai-shek's directly controlled unit known as the "Number One Army Under Heaven."

　　On the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines in northern Henan, our army, under the strategy of accumulating small victories into big ones, also successively wiped out more than one and a half brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's troops.

　　Up to now, the Chiang Kai-shek troops wiped out have reached sixteen brigades (including four American-equipped directly controlled brigades), totaling more than 110,000 men. Nearly 60,000 Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers, including Chiang army division commander (former army commander) Zhao Xitian, and brigade commanders (former division commanders) Huang Zhengcheng, Liu Guangxin, and Yang Xianming, have been captured. We seized 30 mountain guns (including 17 American-made), 8 American-made howitzers, and 510 various types of artillery (rocket launchers, anti-tank guns, mortars, etc.), totaling more than 600 guns of various calibers. We also captured more than 560 heavy machine guns, 2,240 light machine guns, and more than 25,000 rifles, 18 tanks, more than 100 vehicles, and countless ammunition and military supplies. All the weapons and ammunition have been used to equip the People's Liberation Army, and 30,000 captured Chiang Kai-shek soldiers have also taken up arms again to participate in the patriotic self-defense war.

　　At the cost of 110,000 men, the Chiang Kai-shek troops only gained more than 20 isolated empty cities. Recently, after more than 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops were wiped out in Hua County, they were forced to withdraw from Juancheng. Guerrilla warfare has been widely launched behind enemy lines, seriously threatening the Chiang Kai-shek troops. In the vast areas of Heze and Juye south of Jilu and Henan, north of Longhai, west of Caoxian, and east of Dongming, there are no traces of the enemy. In the eleven counties in southern Shanxi centered on Wenxi, guerrilla base areas have been established, liberating a total of 26,000 square miles of land. In the western section of the Daocheng Railway in northern Henan, south of the road, west of the Dadan River, and north of the Qin River, the area is entirely under the control of the guerrillas. The broad masses of people along the Tongpu Railway launched a blasting campaign, killing and wounding large numbers of Chiang Kai-shek troops.

　　Now, Liu Bocheng's ever-victorious People's Army is becoming increasingly powerful with the full support of 30 million people. ××× peasants who have been emancipated have joined the army, and the people of the entire area have been swept up in a surge of support for the front lines. Various military factories have increased production by 210% to 300%. We are advancing bravely to wipe out the second 110,000, the third 110,000, and recover all lost territories.

　　十一万蒋军的毁灭
    七月蒋介石在美帝国主义的援助下，调遣二十二个军（内美械嫡系七个军），共五十个旅，向着冀鲁豫解放区全面进攻，梦想实现“消灭刘伯承主力”的狂妄计划。但四个月以来的事实证明，被消灭的不是刘伯承主力，而是蒋介石的十一万大军。
    冀鲁豫大平原上，天才战略家刘伯承将军麾下的人民常胜军，接连打了陇海、大杨湖、龙墙、鄄城和最近的濮（阳）滑（县）五次大歼灭战，歼灭了进犯蒋军十个半旅，共七万余人，其中包括蒋介石嫡系整三师全部和美械整十一师六千余人。
    在同浦沿线，陈赓将军指挥下的八路军，在闻喜歼灭胡宗南一个多旅；在解放同蒲中段洪洞、赵城等五县时，歼灭了阎军两个旅；在浮山又歼灭了号称“天下第一军”的蒋介石嫡系美械第一旅（原第一师）。
    豫北平汉、正太各线，我军在积小胜为大胜的战略下，也先后歼灭蒋军一个半旅以上。
    截至目前为止，蒋军被歼已达十六个旅（内美械嫡系四个旅）共十一万余人，俘蒋军师长（原军长）赵锡田，旅长（原师长）黄正成、刘广信、杨显明以下官兵近六万人。缴山炮三十门（内美造十七门），美造榴弹炮八门，各型炮（火箭炮、反坦克炮、迫击炮等）五百一十门，共大小口径炮六百余门。重机枪五百六十余挺，轻机枪两千二百四十余挺，步枪两万五千余枝。坦克十八辆，汽车百余辆，弹药军火无算。武器军火全部装备了人民解放军，被俘的蒋军也有三万人，重新拿起武器参加了爱国自卫战争。
    蒋军以十一万人的代价，仅得二十余座孤立的空城。最近滑县被歼蒋军万余人后，又被迫撤出鄄城。敌后游击战争普遍展开，已严重的威胁蒋军。在冀晋豫荷泽、巨野以南，陇海以北，曹县以西，东明以东的广大地区，已无敌踪。在晋南以闻喜为中心的十一县，已建立了游击根据地，共解放土地二万六千平方里。在豫北道清西段路南大丹河西沁河以北，已在游击队全部控制下。在同蒲沿线广大人民展开爆炸运动，大量杀伤蒋军。
    现在刘伯承的人民常胜军在三千万人民的全力支持下，日益强大。翻身农民已有×××人参军，全区人民卷入了支援前线的热潮，各军火工厂增产百分之二百一十到百分之三百。为歼灭第二个十一万，第三个十一万，收复一切失地而勇猛前进。
