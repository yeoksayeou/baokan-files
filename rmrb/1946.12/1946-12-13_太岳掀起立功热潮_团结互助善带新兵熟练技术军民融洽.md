    Taiyue Launches a Campaign to Earn Merits
    Unity and Mutual Assistance, Skilled Training of New Recruits, Harmonious Relations Between the Military and Civilians
    [This newspaper's Taiyue Front, 11th dispatch] In order to annihilate more enemies, the Taiyue Eighth Route Army is now universally launching a campaign to earn merits for annihilating the enemy. A certain unit has completed the process of brewing from the bottom up. Propaganda personnel are working day and night to rush to produce propaganda materials. Reconnaissance personnel, tireless, overcome all kinds of unimaginable difficulties to obtain intelligence. Civil affairs workers, in order to save manpower, rack their brains and make precise calculations without the slightest carelessness. Each company of Unit 007 has proposed to annihilate a platoon or more of the enemy in this new campaign. After individual calculations, a platoon of the ninth company of a certain unit proposed a plan to annihilate thirteen enemies, capture thirteen rifles, and one machine gun per person. The unit leader was concerned and said, "Isn't your plan too high?" The soldiers immediately replied, "What is said will be done, and it cannot be reduced any further." The soldiers have extremely high confidence and have come up with various ways to kill the enemy. Everyone is vying to be an outstanding hero in the people's patriotic self-defense war who kills the enemy.
