*Jilu Yu Daily* Editorial

[Report from Jilu Yu, December 15th] (Delayed) *Jilu Yu Daily* recently published an editorial entitled "The Key to Solving the Yellow River Problem," stating:

Since Heze was occupied by the enemy, the Yellow River project in our area has been sabotaged, river materials have been robbed, and levee repair workers have been shot at and dispersed. Moreover, the first phase of work grain and funds for the Yellow River have not been fully issued, and there is no news of the second phase of funds and materials. This has forced the suspension of projects in our liberated areas. Meanwhile, the Kuomintang has broken its promise to close the breach and has even threatened to release water this winter. The people in our liberated areas are very anxious about this issue and keenly feel that self-defense is the only way out. When we were feeling this way, news suddenly came that the Kaifeng Yellow River Commission was coming to the liberated area to inspect the project, which made us both surprised and worried. We were pleased that they might offer a glimmer of hope for a fair resolution of the Yellow River issue, but worried that the Kuomintang, after the inspection, would spread rumors saying, "There is no need to worry about the downstream dikes," and immediately shirk and sabotage their responsibility, implementing their conspiracy to flood the liberated areas, causing the people in the liberated areas to suffer from the disasters of Chiang Kai-shek on top of natural disasters caused by the Yellow River. Therefore, regarding the key to the Yellow River problem, we believe that it does not lie in the engineering of the liberated areas, but in Chiang Kai-shek's violation of the agreement, failure to repair the upstream dikes, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA)'s obstruction of the allocation of funds and materials, and the Chiang army's attacks and looting. Since July, we have signed several agreements with the Kuomintang, such as the Heze Agreement, which originally stipulated that the river should be closed and the water released only after the completion of projects such as rectifying dangerous sections and straightening the river course. The agreements signed later in the Kaifeng Symposium and Shanghai also stipulated that closing the breach and restoring the dikes should go hand in hand. However, the Kuomintang has only been actively closing the breach unilaterally, while simultaneously deploying large forces to occupy the old course of the Yellow River north and south, oppressing the people along the river, and robbing materials for dike restoration, making it impossible for the people to restore the dikes. These actions fully demonstrate that the Kuomintang's breach closure is not sincere in its intentions to manage the river and rescue the people, but hides a huge military and political conspiracy to slaughter the people on both sides of the Yellow River. From the beginning, this conspiracy aimed to use the Yellow River to divide the liberated areas and facilitate its military offensive. After the military offensive, they also intended to use the floodwaters in conjunction with the military, to create even greater difficulties for the liberated areas. Currently, the Kuomintang is suffering military setbacks and is further attempting to close the breach and release water, plunging the people into a state of eternal suffering as a tool to expand its civil war. This is the basic reason why Chiang Kai-shek disregards the lives of millions of people along the river and the opinions of engineering personnel with a sense of justice, actively sabotages our area's projects, and why the CRRRA has repeatedly obstructed the allocation of materials. The liberated areas rely on human power and have a spirit of resolutely fulfilling agreements, which was fully demonstrated when we completed the levee repair task after the Heze Agreement. Today, we have no funds, no materials, and are constantly subjected to threats and destruction by Chiang's planes. We are in a situation where we have the power but cannot use it. Regarding the Yellow River issue, we have repeatedly stated our position: in order to save our fellow Henan compatriots from the flood, we are willing to endure great suffering ourselves. We only ask that the projects in our area be repaired first and the residents of the riverbed be relocated before the water is released. This is a very reasonable request. However, Chiang Kai-shek will not even agree to this minimum requirement. This is because Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang want to carry out a major conspiracy on the Yellow River issue. The Yellow River breach closure has become an important part of the plan of American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's general staff to expand the civil war. The current CRRRA is purely an agency monopolized by the Kuomintang; Chiang Kai-shek's will is their will. Although some people in it may feel the guilt of their conscience, they cannot help but follow Chiang Kai-shek's intentions and are helpless. One year of facts has taught us that the Kuomintang's monopolization of the CRRRA to solve the Yellow River problem will never be fair and can never escape Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy. Facts have already proven that the key to solving the Yellow River problem lies in direct consultation and resolution between the Yellow River Commission of the liberated areas and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). The CRRRA, monopolized by the Kuomintang, must not be allowed to monopolize the process, and in how to prevent the Kuomintang from destroying our projects, in the prompt distribution of work grain and funds to the liberated areas, in how to make the Kuomintang-occupied areas upstream actively repair the dikes, and especially in determining the principle of not closing the breach and releasing water until the project is completed and the residents are relocated. We hope that the UNRRA and the gentlemen who come to the liberated areas to inspect will deeply recognize that this is a matter of the lives and property of millions of people, and give the people along the river just assistance with justice and compassion. Finally, we, the people of the liberated areas, must always be vigilant against the conspiracy of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek and redouble our efforts to launch our self-defense and self-rescue movement. At the same time, we hope that the UNRRA and all friends with justice will recognize that the CRRRA is a tool of the Kuomintang, recognize the Kuomintang's conspiracy to close the breach quickly, uphold justice, and ensure that the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course is reasonably resolved.

　　解决黄河问题的关键
    冀鲁豫日报社论
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】（迟到）冀鲁豫日报顷以《解决黄河问题的关键》为题发表社论称：
    自我荷泽被侵陷，我区黄河工程被破坏，沿河器材被抢劫，修堤工人被扫射驱散，而且黄河第一期工粮、工款迄未发足，第二期工款、器材则音信毫无，使我解放区工程不得不被迫停止。而国民党则违约堵口，且有今冬放水之说，当我解放区人民对此问题已是十分焦虑，痛感只有自卫之一途的时候，忽有开封黄委会来解放区视察工程的传闻，实使我们惊喜交集：喜的是他们之，或能使黄河问题有一线公平解决之望；惊的是国民党在视察之后，又会造谣谓：“下游堤防无虑”，而即刻推脱、破坏之责，实行水淹解放区的阴谋，使解放区人民惨遭蒋灾之后，又遭黄水之灾。因之关于黄河问题的关键，我们认为不在解放区的工程，而在于蒋介石的破坏协议，不修上游的堤防；行总的阻挠拨款拨料，及蒋军之进攻与劫掠。自七月以来，我们曾和国民党订立几次协议，如荷泽协议，原规定在整理险工，裁湾取直等工程完成之后，再合龙放水。后来开封座谈与上海签定的协议，亦规定堵口与复堤，两者相辅而行。但国民党所进行的则只是单方面的积极堵口，而同时却调动大军进占黄河南北故道地区，摧残沿河人民、抢劫复堤资材、使人民无法复堤。这些表现，已充分说明国民党的堵口，不是诚心诚意为治河救济人民，而是隐藏着极大的屠杀黄河两岸人民的军事政治阴谋。这一阴谋在开始就是想利用黄河、分割解放区，以便利其军事进攻。继军事进攻之后，又想与黄水双管齐下，以造成解放区更大的困难。目前国民党是军事上失利，更图以合龙放水，使人民陷于永劫不复之境，作为其扩大内战之工具。这是蒋介石所以不顾沿河数百万人民生命和具有正义感的工程人员的意见；积极破坏我区工程；行总之所以历次阻挠拨料的基本原因。解放区是靠人力的，更有坚苦履行协议的精神，这在荷泽协议后，我们完成修堤工程任务时，已充分证明了。今天我们既无工款，又无工料，又到处遭受蒋机威胁破坏，我们是处于有力无法用的境地。关于黄河问题，我们曾一再表明态度，我们为了救出河南同胞于水灾，宁愿自己忍受很大的灾难，我们只要求先修好我区工程与先搬完河床居民，再行放水。这是万分合理的要求。但这种最低的要求，蒋介石也不答应。这因为蒋介石国民党要在黄河问题上来一个最大的阴谋，黄河堵口已成为美国帝国主义者和蒋介石参谋部扩大内战计划之重要的一部分。而现有之行政院救济总署，又纯系国民党一党包办的机关；蒋介石的意志，就是他们的意志。尽管其中有些人士曾感到良心的责备，也不能不照着蒋介石的意旨做去而爱莫能助。一年的事实教训我们，国民党一党包办的行总，来解决黄河问题，是永远也不会公道的，是永远逃不了蒋介石的阴谋。事实已经证明，解决黄河问题的关键，在于解放区黄委会与国际善后救济总署，进行直接的商议解决问题，不能由国民党的行总来一手包办的从中垄断，在于如何使国民党不破坏我方工程，在于迅速发给解放区工粮工款，在于如何使上游蒋占区积极修堤，特别在于确定工程未完成居民迁移之前不合龙放水的原则。我们希望联总及来解放区视察的诸先生，深刻认识，这是关系几百万人民生命财产的问题，而以正义与同情给予沿河人民以正当的援助。最后，我们解放区人民必须随时警惕国民党蒋介石的阴谋，加倍的来掀起我们的自卫自救运动。我们同时希望国际善后救济总署及一切有正义的朋友，认清行总是国民党一党的工具，认清国民党迅速堵口的阴谋，主持公道，使黄河归故问题得到合理解决。
