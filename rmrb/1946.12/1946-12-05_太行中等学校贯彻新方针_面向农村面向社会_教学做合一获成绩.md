　　Taihang Secondary School Implements New Policy
    Facing the Countryside, Facing Society
  　Combining Teaching and Doing to Achieve Results
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Taihang's secondary schools have achieved preliminary results in implementing the new educational policy. After the area held a secondary school education conference in July this year, which proposed the educational spirit and teaching methods of combining education with production and integrating teaching and doing, faculty and students of various schools conducted detailed research. It was found that many teachers and students (especially in the new areas) were initially skeptical and resistant. Some students at Changzhi Agricultural Vocational School believed that returning to rural areas for employment after graduation violated their "aspirations." More than 90% were unwilling to engage in agricultural improvement work after graduation. Among the 76 students in the Normal Class of Zhangbin Middle School, 23 were unwilling to become teachers after graduation. Teachers were mainly afraid that after breaking away from textbooks and rote teaching, they would no longer be able to be teachers. In order to solve the above problems, the Second Middle School focused on problems, tackling them one by one, and clarified that the integration of doing, learning, and teaching is the future standardization. Facing society and opening the school doors to teach in the countryside is standardization. Zhangbin Middle School proposed that all cadres in the future must be liked by the common people, and it is impossible without practical skills, which changed everyone's view of being divorced from reality. Finally, the authorities of each school proposed to definitely meet the requirements of improving culture and learning practical culture, and everyone settled down. After the new education policy was recognized ideologically, it began to be implemented successively in August: the Third and Fourth Middle Schools all participated in the peasant emancipation teams, and some students and teachers from Yuzhong, Zhangzhong, and Changshi participated in mass movements. The Eighth Middle School and Bozhong organized student war participation teams to care for wounded soldiers in field hospitals, and Changzhi Vocational School also sent students to various counties to conduct autumn field seed selection, etc. It began to combine schools with mass movements and war. In the past three months, the new education policy has achieved preliminary results in practice. In terms of combining education with production, each school has equipped itself with small factories or workshops. On the one hand, they learned practical knowledge from doing, and on the other hand, they learned theory from doing. For example, the Yubei Middle School organized two classes to cut firewood in Nanshan for half a month. On the one hand, they produced 100,000 catties of firewood, which improved their lives, but more importantly, the students learned "inclined planes" and "levers" in mechanics, as well as the four arithmetic operations in mathematics, which were much more profound than learning from textbooks in the classroom. Li Huimin and Cao Youren of the school's industrial engineering group improved a spinning machine that was ten times faster than the usual one in "doing". Nearby people rushed to ask them to teach the technology; the Jiji people even took up cotton fluffer bows and knitting machines to exchange for their spinning machines, and the relationship was very close. It is expected that these students will be welcomed by the masses after they leave the school. The school has factories with multiple knitting machines, spinning machines, cotton gins, and weaving machines, and is still adding production tools one after another, planning to earn 400,000 yuan every day next year to be self-sufficient in clothing for the whole school; in particular, it plans to learn more knowledge and useful theories in various production and other practices than in the past from textbooks. Zhangbin Middle School used 50 acres of school land and specially hired an old farmer and a natural science teacher to guide students in learning about the effects of soil, fertilizer, sunlight, and water on plants, as well as the scientific knowledge of the properties and cultivation of various crops. The students all understood them one by one and became their own vivid true knowledge. The school's female students helped and organized the women of nearby common people to learn weaving together. Xing Shi tried to build a new-style weaving machine with 100,000 yuan, and after it was successful, they promoted it to the masses. The above-mentioned schools are all combining learning in school with the current needs of the masses, which is in line with the spirit of the new policy. In addition, some middle schools have begun to implement large-unit teaching. When Zhangbin Normal School tried out unit teaching of the national language, it first determined that learning the national language was to improve the ability to read and analyze problems, strictly separating it from composition. As a result of the trial, both teachers and students said they benefited greatly. In general: it has initially overcome the inverted view of "studying for the sake of entering a higher school" and "studying for the sake of studying"; it has begun to establish the concept of combining education with production and serving the new society; other things such as teachers and students learning from each other are all gains in the trial implementation of the new education policy.

### 太行中等学校贯彻新方针  面向农村面向社会　教学做合一获成绩

　　太行中等学校贯彻新方针
    面向农村面向社会
  　教学做合一获成绩
    【本报特讯】太行各中等学校试行新教育方针，已获初步成绩。该区今年七月举行中等学校教育会议中，提出教育与生产结合，教学做合一的教育精神与教学方法后，各校教职学员均作了详细的研究。发现不少教员学生（特别是新区的），开始都是怀疑、抗拒的。长治农职部分学生认为毕业后再回到农村就业是违犯自己“志愿”的。百分之九十以上不愿在毕业后做农业改进工作。漳滨中学师范班七十六人中，不愿在毕业后做教员者达二十三人。教员主要是惟恐打破书本教材、照本宣科的教学以后，便无法再当教员。为了解决上述问题，二中以问题为中心，扭住一个解决一个，明确了做学教合一是今后的正规化。面向社会，打开学校门到农村上课是正规化。漳滨中学提出今后一切干部都是要老百姓喜欢的，没有实际本领就不行，转变了大家脱离实际的观点。最后各学校当局提出一定满足提高文化的要求，学习实用的文化后，大家也就安心下来。新教育方针在思想上认识后，八月起先后开始试行：三中、四中全部参加农民翻身队，豫中、漳中、长师部分学生、教员参加群运。八中、博中组织了学生参战队，到野战医院照护伤兵，长职也派了学生到各县进行秋田选种等。开始做到使学校和群运与战争结合。三个月来，新教育方针在实践中已获初步成绩。教育与生产结合上，各校都设备了小型工厂或作坊，一面从做中学到了实际知识，同时又从做中学到了理论。如豫北中学组织两个班上南山砍柴半月，一方面生产了十万斤柴火，使自己生活改善，而更主要的是同学们在做中学到了“力学上的斜面”，“杠杆”，数学上的四则计算等，比在课堂上死啃书本学到的深刻得多。该校工业工学团李惠民、曹友仁在“做”中改进了比普遍快十倍的纺织机，附近群众纷纷跑去请他们教技术；汲淇群众还拿起弹花弓、织袜机去换他们的纺织机，关系十分密切。预料这些同学出校后一定受群众欢迎。该校已设有织袜机、纺纱机、轧花机、织布机多部的工厂，仍陆续添置生产工具，计划在明年每天赚洋四十万元，全校穿衣自给；特别计划要在各种生产及其他实践中学到比过去书本上丰富得多的各种知识和有用学理。漳滨中学以五十亩校田，专聘一位老农和自然教员结合，指导学生学习土壤、肥料、日光与水对植物的作用，各种农作物的性质与种植等科学常识，学生都一一理解，成为自己活生生的真知识。该校女生帮助并组织附近老百姓女人一起学习纺织，邢师以十万元试造新式纺织机，成功后即向群众推广。上述各校都是把在校学习和目前群众需要结合起来，是符合新方针精神的。此外，某些中学已开始实行大单元教学。漳滨师范班在试行国语单元教学时，首先确定学国语是为了提高读书与分析问题的能力，严格与作文分开。试行结果，无论教员、学生都说得益很大。总的说来：初步克服了从来就是“为升学而念书”，“为念书而念书”的倒置观点；开始建立了教育与生产结合，为新社会服务的概念；其他如师生互相学习等，都是新教育方针在试行中的收获。
