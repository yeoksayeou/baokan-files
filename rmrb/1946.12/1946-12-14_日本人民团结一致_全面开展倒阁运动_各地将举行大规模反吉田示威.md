    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 11th: Comprehensive reports from Tokyo state that the Japanese people are responding with heroic actions to the 91st Diet's intention to support Yoshida's suppression of labor. Preparations for rallies to overthrow the cabinet are underway nationwide. Large-scale rallies and demonstrations to overthrow the cabinet will be held across the country. A key feature of this new movement is the unprecedented level of unity among workers. Under pressure from the masses, Socialist Party leaders have cooperated with this movement initiated by the Japanese Communist Party and have submitted a motion of no confidence in the Yoshida cabinet to the Diet. The Socialist Party has also decided to call on business circles in Tokyo to participate in the movement on the 17th. The Federation of Industrial Unions, led by the Japanese Communist Party, also revealed that the Japan Teachers' Union may respond to the December 17th movement to overthrow Yoshida with a strike, as negotiations between the union and the government have broken down. Furthermore, teachers at seven schools near Tokyo have been autonomously managing school administration since the 8th, disobeying instructions from the Ministry of Education.
