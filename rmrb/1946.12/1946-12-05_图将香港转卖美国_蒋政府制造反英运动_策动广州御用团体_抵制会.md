Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Nanjing dispatch: Following the so-called "Kowloon Incident" in October, the Chiang government has again launched a so-called "boycott Hong Kong" anti-British movement. In late November, the Chiang government instigated various puppet organizations in Guangzhou to form a so-called "Boycott Hong Kong Committee" and announced that from today, all ships traveling between Hong Kong and Guangzhou would be boycotted, and no loading or unloading of goods would be allowed. The puppet organization declared that "the purpose of the boycott is to recover Hong Kong." It is said that the British business delegation visiting China, which is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the 5th, is also on the boycott list, and it is claimed that the boycott Hong Kong movement is to protest the tragic death of Hong Kong peanut vendor Wang Yongxiang being kicked to death by foreign police. Observers here point out that thousands of atrocities have occurred in Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin and other places where American troops stationed in China have massacred and beaten our compatriots and raped our women, but the Chiang government has not only not protested a single word, but also prohibits the publication of American atrocities. Wu Tiecheng even raised his thumb and repeatedly shouted "Excellent." In light of this situation, the so-called protest against the peanut vendor's tragic death is purely an excuse. Its purpose is nothing more than to cover up the Chiang government's traitorous crimes and sell Hong Kong to American imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: According to Shanghai United Evening News, Hong Kong dispatch: American goods have already been defeated in Hong Kong. When the Japanese invaders initially withdrew from Hong Kong, American forces followed, penetrating all sectors of society, and American goods flooded the market, no different from the situation in major Chinese cities. Since the Hong Kong government took over, the British have taken control through actions, doing their best to weaken and restrict the Americans, and using various conveniences to support British merchants. After a year, the advantage of American goods has finally been overwhelmed.

　　图将香港转卖美国
  　蒋政府制造反英运动
  　策动广州御用团体“抵制会”
    【新华社延安一日电】南京讯：继十月间所谓“九龙事件”之后，蒋政府又发动所谓“抵制香港”的反英运动。十一月下旬，蒋政府策动广州各御用团体组织所谓“抵制香港委员会”，并宣布自今日起实行抵制所有香港广州间往来轮船，一律不准装卸货物。该御用团体声言“抵制之目的为收回香港”。据说将于五日抵港的英商各访华团亦在被抵制之列，并声称抵制香港运动乃用以抗议香港花生小贩王永祥被外警踢死惨案。此间观察家指出，上海北平天津等地驻华美军屠杀殴打我同胞强奸我妇女的暴行已发生了几千次，蒋政府不但未有一字抗议，而且禁止登载美军暴行事件，吴铁城还翘起大姆指连叫“顶好”。拿这种情况来看，所谓抗议小贩惨案，纯是一种借口，其目的无非蒋政府企图以此掩盖其卖国罪行，并将香港转卖给美国帝国主义而已。
    【新华社延安一日电】据上海联合晚报香港讯：美货在香港已吃败仗。缘日寇初自港撤离时，美人势力随之而入，深入社会各部门，美货亦复充斥市场，与中国诸大城市情形无异。自港政府接事后，英人藉行动控制，竭力削弱与限制美人，用各种便利扶植英商，经一年后，美货优势终被压倒。
