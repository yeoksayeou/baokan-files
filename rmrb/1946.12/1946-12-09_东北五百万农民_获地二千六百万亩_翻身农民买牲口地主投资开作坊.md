　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th】By the end of October, five million landless or land-poor farmers in the Northeast Liberated Areas had obtained 26 million mu of land. This includes 4.8 million mu in Songjiang Province, 6 million mu in Heilongjiang Province, 2 million mu in Hejiang Province, 4 million mu in Liaoji Province, 300,000 mu in Mudanjiang and other areas, 1.2 million mu in Jilin Province, 740,000 mu in Liaoning Province, and 3 million mu in Andong Province. After obtaining land, the lives of farmers have improved. The ancient villages, which were on the verge of collapse after fourteen years of exploitation by the enemy, have suddenly shown a thriving scene. In a certain district of Liaoji Province, after the realization of "land to the tiller," hired peasants and middle peasants have successively purchased livestock, and landlords have also turned to engage in workshop production. In Sanhe Village and Dafang Village of that district alone, farmers have purchased 50 horses, cattle, and donkeys, newly built 40 houses this autumn, and opened 5 flour mills and 2 oil mills. Sun Keshe, a hired peasant in Sanhe Village, and his three brothers had no houses or land this spring, but after obtaining 15 mu of land and 3 houses, and purchasing two horses with the grain returned during the increase-production movement, they have now jumped to become wealthy middle peasants. He Chengxiang, who rose from a poor peasant to a middle peasant, also built three brand-new houses on the house foundation he was allocated after liberation. A large landlord in a certain village, after being liquidated, was willing to operate a flour mill. With the help of the democratic government, the business has continued to develop, and now a new flour mill has been added. Liu Yingchun, a landlord who had fled, has returned and is actively participating in production with the assistance of the government.
