    From Poverty to Riches Through Pig Farming and Flour Milling
    [This Dispatch from Yangcheng] Guo Jinsheng, a pig farming expert from Yaotou Village in this county, was recognized by the masses in his village this spring as a model of production and a skilled pig farmer. His family has a total of six people, with only two full laborers. Flour milling is his family's tradition, while pig farming is something he learned on his own. In the past, he was afraid of heavy burdens and being struggled against, so his production was not very profitable. After participating in various expert meetings this spring and understanding the government's laws and regulations, he resolved these two ideological issues: one, he no longer fears being struggled against for becoming wealthy; and two, he is not afraid of burdens. He then actively engaged in pig farming and flour milling, and has gone from having little to eat and wear to becoming prosperous. Last July, he bought two piglets, one male and one female, for a total of 2,750 yuan. After mating, the old sow gave birth to piglets, and the piglets grew up and gave birth to more piglets. Now he has 15 pigs. In pig farming, he has earned a total of 101,450 yuan, excluding costs. His experience in pig farming is as follows: (1) The pigsty should not be too damp, as pigs prefer dirty mud, and the smell of dirty mud is very strong, hindering the pig's development and making it prone to illness. (2) Pigs are not afraid of being rained on while passing by, but they are afraid of prolonged rain. The top of the pigsty must be covered with something to shield from the rain. (3) If a pig becomes ill, first cut open the pig's ear and tail slightly. If fresh blood comes out, it will get better. If no fresh blood comes out, then further treatment is ineffective. (4) Pigs should see the sun every day and run around every day for fast development. (5) The temperature of the pig feed should depend on the coldness of the climate. His good experience in flour milling is: 1. Use warm water to soak corn and cold water to soak beans (mung beans). Using water that is too hot will make it difficult to produce flour. 2. Grind the flour twice. If it doesn't grind well the first time, moisten it and grind it again. 3. The sieve for sifting the flour should be fine, otherwise, no flour will come out. (Ma Liang)

    养猪磨粉由穷变富
    【本报阳城讯】本县窑头村养猪行家郭金生，今春被本村群众公认为是生产的模范，又是养猪的能手。他全家共六口人，只有两个全劳力，磨粉是祖传，养猪是自己摸索的。过去怕出负担多，怕被斗争到自己的头上，所以生产不很赚钱。因在今春参加了各种行家会议，了解了政府的法令，解决了他这两个思想问题：一个是不怕发财致富被人斗争，一个是不怕负担，他就积极的养猪磨粉，且由少吃、没穿，变得富裕了。去年七月他买了两个小猪，一公一母，共二千七百五十元，配种后，就这样的老猪下小猪，小猪长大又下小猪，到现在变成了十五个猪，在养猪上，除过本外，共赚十万一千四百五十元。他养猪的经验是这样的：（一）猪圈里不可太湿了，因猪最好脏泥，脏泥的气味很臭，妨碍猪的发育，又肯生病。（二）猪不怕过路雨淋，但怕长淋，猪圈顶上一定要盖上蔽雨的东西。（三）万一猪要有了病，先拿这把猪耳朵和尾巴稍剪开，如能出点鲜血，就会好，不流出鲜血，则再看亦无效。（四）猪每天能见到太阳，每天出来跑跑发育快。（五）吃食子的冷热，要看气候的冷热。在磨粉上好的经验是：一、用温水泡玉茭、冷水泡豆子（绿豆），用过热的水，不易出粉面。二、磨粉要磨两次，一次磨不开，淋后再磨一次。三、淋粉的罗子要细，不然不出粉。（马良）
