　　【Report from Changzhi by our newspaper on the 13th】In the enemy's rear in Anyang, a propaganda war is unfolding between the enemy and us. Our Anyang County Headquarters and the Salvation Association have compiled and printed over twenty kinds of propaganda materials for KMT-puppet soldiers and people in the occupied areas, which are distributed in the enemy's rear. The masses are delighted, and the KMT-puppet bullies are extremely alarmed. One night, our Fifth District militia and armed work team raided Nanliuzhi, distributing a large number of propaganda materials, spreading the news of our army's victory and our determination to recover lost territory everywhere. The masses happily said, "The Eighth Route Army is coming back soon! The stubborn troops won't occupy us for long! Let's drag out the grain and money that the damned dogs are trying to collect!" The next morning, two-thirds of the bullies, special agents, and fleeing landlords had slipped away. On the 20th of last month, our guerrilla group went to Hexi. Following Comrade Guo Zhancun, a teacher, we pasted our handbills on top of the KMT-puppet leaflets. People secretly read them: "When it comes to killing, the Central Army is number one in the world. Boiling people alive in a cauldron of boiling water, the director of the Bailongmiao Farmers' Association lost his life. Militiamen, fellow villagers, let's avenge him!" "American-made Chiang troops, disguised as good people, use flowery words to guarantee your peace. Arrest young men and send you to the army, old people and children build cities and fill trenches, arrest women and rape them, kill them on the spot if they don't obey." We change slogans and pass on messages every night, and the masses are all scrambling to see them.

　　告诉群众：八路军一定要回来  安阳廿余种宣传品深入敌后
    【本报长治十三日电】安阳敌后，敌我展开宣传战。我安阳县指挥部与救联会编印了二十余种对蒋伪士兵、沦陷区群众等的宣传品，散发在敌后，群众欢欣，蒋伪恶霸异常惊惶。一日夜我五区民兵武工队奔袭南流峙，散发了大批宣传品，到处传播了我军胜利消息和我收复失地的决心。群众高兴的说：“八路军快回来啦，顽固军占不久啦，狗日们派下的粮款给他拖吧。”第二天早晨，三分之二的恶霸和特务逃亡地主都溜了。上月二十号，我游击集团到河西，随着教员郭占存同志把咱的传请贴在蒋伪的传单上，人们都偷偷的念着：“论杀人是中央军，世界上考头名，开水锅活煮人，白龙庙农会主任丧了命，民兵们，老乡们，大家替他报仇恨。”“美造蒋军，伪装善人，花言巧语，保你安宁。捉住青壮，送你从军，老人小孩，筑城填坑，捉住妇女，强行奸淫，一点不从，就地毙命。”我们天天夜间换标语传信，群众都争着看。
