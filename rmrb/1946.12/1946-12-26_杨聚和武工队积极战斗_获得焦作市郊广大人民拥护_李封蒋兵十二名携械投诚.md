　　Yang Juhe's Militia Actively Fights
    Gaining Support from the Broad Masses in the Suburbs of Jiaozuo
    Twelve Chiang Soldiers from Lifeng Defect with Weapons
    [Our Newspaper, Northern Henan News] Yang Juhe's militia, through active combat actions against the enemy and puppets who were seizing grain, has gained the support of the broad masses in the suburbs of Jiaozuo. On the 8th of this month, Wei Changtai, a miscellaneous squad leader of the enemy from Wangfeng, with more than thirty men and over ten civilian laborers, went to Si Hou Village to seize grain. Upon learning of this, the militia dispatched Comrade Wang Qingbang with a squad of brothers to rush there, pushing the grain-grabbing enemies into the deep ditch behind Si Hou Village. Chiang's army "tried to steal a chicken but lost the rice," abandoning all their sacks and a ceremonial bugle. Since the beginning of this month, wherever the enemy is discovered, Old Yang's team flies there as if it had wings. On the 12th, before noon, the militia sentry post on Red Sand Ridge knocked down the liaison signal warning of the enemy. Upon seeing this, Old Yang's team rushed to the hilltop and encountered more than twenty enemies. They were quick and agile, wounding two enemies and driving the enemy back. The grain-grabbing enemies set out four times continuously from the 7th to the 12th, but were repelled by Yang Juhe and Ren Xiuhe's militia. A total of six enemies were killed or wounded. The enemy and puppet miscellaneous troops besieged in the Lifeng mining area of Jiaozuo have not been able to seize a single grain of food in the past half month, but the masses in the villages where Old Yang's militia goes steam buns and grind flour to welcome them. The masses in Majie Gully sent people to invite Yang Juhe's militia to stay in their village, willing to help the members grind and gather firewood. Their combat morale is extremely high. The militia's cook also requested to go to the front to capture enemies.

    [Our Newspaper, Northern Henan News] The soldiers of the Chiang army's 17th Brigade in Jiaozuo are extremely panicked and demoralized under the combined military, political, and diplomatic blows of our side, and are fleeing in droves. Twelve soldiers from the enemy's 51st Regiment in Lifeng alone have fled to our side, bringing with them machine guns, shells, and other weapons. According to Chiang army soldiers such as Shi Hengde, the Chiang army in Jiaozuo is suffering heavy losses in combat, with many vacancies. Each company has an average of only ten veteran soldiers; although a new batch of recruits was sent from Zhengzhou on the 26th of last month, each company still has less than one hundred men on average. The new recruits are all forcibly conscripted or captured. They are currently still wearing single-layer clothes and are not getting enough to eat. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the new recruits are very homesick and often confide in each other in secret: "I was captured, and I still have a family to take care of..." Shi Hengde and others firmly believe: "The brothers (Chiang soldiers) in Jiaozuo already know your (Eighth Route Army's) lenient policy. They don't want to die for Old Chiang and want to come to the Eighth Route Army's side like us."

　　杨聚和武工队积极战斗
    获得焦作市郊广大人民拥护
    李封蒋兵十二名携械投诚
    【本报豫北讯】杨聚和武工队以积极战斗行动打击敌顽抢粮，获得了焦作市郊广大人民拥护。本月八日王封之敌杂牌队长魏长泰等三十余人随带民夫十余到寺后村抢粮，武工队获悉即派王庆邦同志，带一班弟兄赶上去，把抢粮敌人压到寺后的深沟里，蒋军“偷鸡不着折把米”，反撇下了全部口袋和一个彩号。本月以来，只要那里发现了敌人，老杨的队伍就像长了翅膀一样飞到那里。十二日午前，红沙岭上的民兵了望哨，把警戒敌人的联络记号推倒了。老杨的队伍一见就赶上山头，正与二十多个敌人遭遇，他们眼明手快，击伤敌二人，把敌人打退了。抢粮敌人从七号到十二号连续出发四次，都被杨聚和与任秀河的武工队击退。共毙伤敌六名。困守焦作李封矿区敌伪杂牌，半月来抢不到一粒粮食，但老杨的武工队所到那村的群众却蒸馍推面来欢迎他们，麻界沟的群众派人请杨聚和武工队到他村去住，愿意帮队员推磨打柴。他们的战斗情绪异常高涨。武工队的伙夫也要求上前方捉敌人。

    【本报豫北讯】焦作蒋军十七旅士兵在我军事、政治交五打击下，极为恐慌颓丧，纷纷逃亡。仅从李封敌五十一团逃来我方士兵即有十二名，随带机枪、炮弹等武器。据蒋军士兵石恒德等称：焦作蒋军因作战损失，缺额甚多，每连平均只有十个老兵；上月二十六号虽新从郑州送来一批新兵，平均每连仍不足百名。新兵都是强征或抓来的。目前仍着单衣，食不果腹。年关逼近，新兵非常想家常在背地里互叙心曲：“俺是被抓来的呀，俺家里还有一家老小呀………”石恒德等坚信：“焦作弟兄们（蒋军）已经知道你们（八路军）的宽大政策，他们都不想替老蒋送死，都想和我们一样到八路军这边”。
