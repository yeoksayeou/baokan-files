　　Army and People Jointly Capture Shaoer Village
    Tian Xiao, Hu Qi, Wu Xiang
    Two months ago, Chiang Kai-shek's troops trampled into Huaxian County. The militiamen quietly bid farewell to their parents, wives, daughters, and beloved homes. They carried guns seized from the Japanese devils and puppet troops and bravely launched a guerrilla war. Chiang Kai-shek's troops forced the families to call back the militiamen and hand over their weapons within a limited time. Songzhuang, in the southeast corner of Huaxian County, was punished for resistance, and more than twenty people were shot and killed. Xu Kaiqing, a militiaman from Miaoqiu Village, couldn't bear to see his elderly mother being abused, so he ran back. Chiang Kai-shek's troops confiscated his gun and demanded twenty more. They hung him up and beat him three times before finally burying him alive. Hu Jinchao's wife from Gaopingji sent a message urging him to return, but later she came herself. She said, "I was so confused; I almost harmed you. Going back is a dead end. Do your job well, and don't come home until these dogs are driven away!"
    The militiamen were tempered and educated in hardship, and their struggle became more resolute and tenacious. On the 17th, on that dark early winter night, a field army under the command of General Liu Bocheng, crossed sixty *li* of Chiang Kai-shek's heavily fortified area and advanced south. The guides were the local militiamen. They didn't stop along the way, nor did they pass through any villages, and even the dogs were rarely disturbed. These militiamen had been sending messages, making contacts, and scouting the terrain day and night, and their feet were covered in blisters, but they were overjoyed in their hearts.
    After the so-called "ceasefire order" came into effect, the vanguard of the 125th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 47th Division advanced to the north of Liangmen Town, which belongs to Puyang County, but the brigade headquarters and the two battalions guarding it were still in Shaoer Village, on the border between Huaxian and Changyuan counties. He thought this arrangement was very safe, but the Eighth Route Army and the militiamen insisted on counterattacking this seemingly secure place first. The village had walls eight *chi* high and five *chi* thick, with *lù zhài* (barricades of sharpened wooden stakes) outside, as well as thirteen pillboxes and two outer moats, each one *zhang* wide and deep. Inside and outside the outer moat, there were more than one hundred hidden bunkers of varying heights blocking the way. But the Eighth Route Army and the militiamen had scouted out this tortoise shell, and even probed the depth of the water in the outer moat with stones. So when Chiang Kai-shek's sentries opened their hazy sleepy eyes in the middle of the night and realized things were bad, they didn't even acknowledge the Eighth Route Army but they frantically swept and bombarded with machine guns and mountain guns. Instead, the Eighth Route Army ignored them and focused on digging fortifications to fully prepare for the annihilation strike the next day.
    After dawn, Chiang Kai-shek's firepower became even more intense, but in the flat, bare fields, transverse and vertical communication trenches had been dug, and mountain guns, which had been advanced to less than three hundred meters away, had been covered. The soldiers lying prone in the trenches continued to advance towards the outer moat without firing a single shot. Militiaman Hao Ming crawled and rolled on the road where bullets were whizzing. Just as it got dark, the attack began. The mountain guns fired accurately at targets that had been aimed at for a long time. The second shot killed Chiang Kai-shek's deputy artillery company commander and damaged the American-made artillery. The brave engineers divided into two groups. As soon as the first group blew up the outer moat, the second group took advantage of the rising flames and smoke to rush in and blow up the *lù zhài*. As soon as the *lù zhài* was blown up, the first group rushed in again to blow up the second outer moat. Seven openings were blown open in the *lù zhài*, and three openings were blown open in the outer moat. The attacking troops rushed into the outer moat from the east and west sides simultaneously. Chiang Kai-shek's troops relied on their solid fortifications to throw down flares and fiercely counterattack from a high position. The Second Company was pushed down five times but rushed back up the city wall. Combat hero Li Zhiwu stubbornly resisted on the village wall while covered in wounds. Five men in his platoon were wounded, but they continued to charge fiercely at Chiang Kai-shek's troops with hand grenades. Troops also rushed in from the northeast corner. Amidst the earth-shattering explosions and red flames, warriors ran up the city on three ladders. A stone thrown up by a shell hit Huang Caitang in the head, creating two large holes. Just as he stood up, a burning bomb exploded. His sleeves and back were on fire. Huang Caitang rolled on the ground to extinguish the fire and threw a hand grenade forward, shouting angrily, "Charge! The enemy is about to collapse!" Platoon Leader Yang Beifang ordered Dong Fengshan to set up a machine gun on the roof. The Tenth Company rushed past, the Third Battalion rushed in, the forward fortifications were breached, and Chiang Kai-shek's troops were completely shaken and confused. Everywhere was fire, everywhere was exploding, everywhere was shouting. Unbridled warhorses neighed in confusion. The captured guns, artillery, and ammunition were piled up like small mountains. Five cars and five mountain guns became trophies. More than two thousand Chiang Kai-shek's troops were taken prisoner.

　　军民合取邵耳寨
    天晓、胡奇，吴象
    两个月前，蒋军铁蹄踏进了滑县，民兵们就悄悄地告别了爹娘妻女和亲爱的家，扛着从日本鬼子和伪军手里缴来的枪，英勇的展开了游击战，蒋军逼令家属们限期叫回民兵交出枪枝。滑县东南角的宋庄，因为表示抗拒，被枪杀了二十多个人；庙秋村民兵许开清不忍老母被虐打，跑回去了，蒋军缴了他一枝枪，还向他要二十枝。吊打了他三次，最后把他活埋了；高平集胡金潮的老婆上去捎信来要他回去，后来她自己跑来了，她说：“我太糊涂了，差一点害了你，回去只死路一条。好好干吧，不赶走这些狗东西别回家！”
    民兵们在苦难中得到了磨练和教育，斗争更加坚决顽强。十七日，这个黑暗的初冬之夜，刘伯承将军指挥下的一支野战军，越过六十里密布蒋军据点的纵深地带，向南挺进，带路的就是当地的民兵，他们一路没有停留，也没有经过一个村庄，连狗也很少惊动。这些民兵连日连夜的送信联络，侦察地形，脚上都打起了泡，但是心里却喜欢得要炸了。
    在所谓“停战令”生效后，蒋军四十七师一二五旅的先头部队，攻到了濮阳县属的两门镇以北，但是旅部和守卫它的两个营，却还在滑县、长垣交界处的邵耳寨。他以为这样的布置是很保险的，但是八路军和民兵偏偏首先向这个保险的地方反击。这个寨子有八尺高五尺厚的寨墙，鹿砦之外，还有十三个碉堡和两道宽深各及一丈的外壕，外壕里外又有一百多个高矮不等的暗堡封锁着。但是八路军和民兵已经把这乌龟壳侦察明白，连外壕里水的深浅都用石子探过了，所以当蒋军哨兵半夜睁开朦胧的睡眼，发现事情不好，没头没脑的用机枪山炮扫射、轰击的时候，八路军竟不予理会，只顾挖工事，为次日歼灭打击作充分准备。
    黎明之后，蒋军火力越发猛烈，但是平坦光净的田野间，已挖好纵横的交通壕，推进到不足三百米远的山炮，都作了掩体，匐匍在战壕里的战士们，仍然一枪不发地逼进外壕，民兵郝鸣在枪弹噗噗乱闪的道路上爬滚着。天刚黑，攻击开始了。山炮准确地对着久已瞄好的目标发射，第二下就把蒋军的炮兵副连长打死，把美制炮打坏了，勇敢的工兵分成两组，第一组刚炸开外壕，第二组便乘着冒起的火光和浓烟冲进去炸鹿砦。鹿砦刚炸开，第一组又冲进去炸第二道外壕，鹿砦炸开七个口，外壕炸开三个口，攻击部队从东西两边同时冲进外壕，蒋军凭借坚固的工事把照明弹掷下来，居高临下地凶猛反扑，第二连被扑下五次又冲上城去，战斗英雄李致吾带着彩在寨墙上顽抗，他所率领的班有五个人负了伤，但都继续以手榴弹向蒋军猛冲。东北角也有部队冲进来了，一片震天动地的暴响和红红的火光之中，三个梯子上飞跑着登城的勇士，一个炮弹炸起的石子把黄采堂头上打了两个大窟窿，他刚站起来，又一个燃烧弹爆炸了，他衣袖和背上都着了火，黄采堂在地上打了个滚，把火滚熄，用手榴弹向前掷去，愤怒的喊道：“冲呀！敌人马上就要完了。”排长杨北方派董凤山把机枪架到房上。第十连冲过去了，第三营冲进去了，前沿工事突破了，蒋军完全动摇混乱了。到处是火光，到处是暴响，到处是喊叫，脱缰的战马混乱着嘶鸣，缴获的枪炮弹药堆的和小山一样。五辆汽车、五门山炮成了胜利品。二千余蒋军作了俘虏。
