Starting from the Case of Traitor Judging Traitor
思基

The Shanghai Wenhui Daily of October 4th carried:

"The 'Traitor Trial' drama in Peiping (Beiping) has another shocking performance. After the major traitor Wang Yitang was sentenced to death, yesterday, two lawyers, representing the traitor Wang, placed a large advertisement in various newspapers. It stated that the presiding judge of the case, He Chengzhuo (currently the Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the Hebei High Court), was the Dean of Academics of the judicial officer training institute during the puppet regime, and thus a minor traitor under Wang Yitang’s administration. It was also stated that Wang remained silent during all trials because of this. He felt resentful to be tried in a court of traitors. The advertisement also said: 'If Tang is said to be a major traitor, then the presiding judge is a minor traitor under Yitang’s administration. Now that the homeland has been restored, the work of trying traitors is actually being done by traitors. What will the world and future generations think of this era! Yitang may have made 'mistakes' politically (?), but having studied the teachings of sages and being mindful of the importance of shame, he is deeply concerned about leaving a great disgrace in the history of traitor trials of the Chinese nation! The reason why Yitang has remained silent during all trials is because he has unspeakable pain. If he were to receive the ultimate punishment at the hands of this traitor judge, Yitang would not die in peace.'"

After this advertisement was published, the world was shocked. Everyone was stunned and speechless at this strange news. He Chengzhuo, feeling that this had damaged the dignity of the court, quickly issued a statement:

"...He only worked as a professor at the puppet judicial officer training institute. 'Whether a professor is a traitor or not, I can only laugh it off.'"

The President of the High Court, Deng Zhezhao, suddenly hearing someone "biting back" at his subordinate and calling him a traitor, also felt it was damaging to his reputation and immediately defended him:

"He has always been working underground in the occupied areas under orders."

This statement was more concise than He Chengzhuo's own defense, shutting everyone up. The case of "traitor judging traitor" immediately became "underground worker judging traitor." Since He Chengzhuo was an "underground worker" for the "National Revolutionary Army" and the "Head of State," who could distinguish whether the rebel Wang Yitang was not a comrade of the "Supreme Leader President Chiang Kai-shek"? Don't you see that after the "restoration of the homeland," all the traitorous villains are "underground" personnel of the Kuomintang?"

The traitor Li Ying is the "underground" Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang.

The traitor Wu Huawen is "Chiang Kai-shek's 'underground' army group."

The traitors and bandits Wang Ziquan, Guo Qing, and Wang Zemin are all comrades of the "President" and have been promoted to significant positions.

The traitors Zeng Qi, Tang ＠ming, etc., are representatives of Chiang's "National Assembly," openly supporting the future president's ascension to the throne.

Alas, the use of traitors is great! What is so strange about using traitors to judge traitors! Traitors are as numerous as hairs on an ox, and they openly appear on stage, kicking down the door for the old Chiang rogue and playing supporting roles. What does this indicate? One explanation is that "good people don't come to the Chiang government." Another is that birds of a feather flock together. Since the leader is the Philippines' Roxas, what choice is there between Japan and the United States? One must find experts to sell out the country! Thus, all the most heinous traitors to the motherland are draped in the "underground work" cloak of Nanjing, becoming "central" people, and the "supreme leader" is also their like-minded "comrade"! Isn't that also naturally reasonable!

However, what do the people who have been ravaged by traitors say? The people of northern Henan once sang with such anger:

The mule cart has passed,
The water flows down the Zhang River,
Guo Qing owes lives,
Oh, Heaven,
He is now a "Central Army" member…

But so what if you become a "Central Army" member? As long as you wear the American-style wide-brimmed traitor hat to fight the civil war and suppress the people, the people will annihilate you brigade by brigade and confiscate your guns. If you are still unwilling to give up and use some piglet traitors to open a "National Assembly," create public opinion, and openly sell out the country to fight a civil war, then the people will tear off your skin and expose you to the light of day. No matter whether you sell out to Japan "underground" or sell out to the United States above ground, you will ultimately not escape the judgment of the people and will never be allowed to "laugh it off."

### 从汉奸审奸案说起

    从汉奸审奸案说起
    思基
    上海文汇报十月四日载：
    “平市（北平）审奸戏，又有惊人演出，巨奸王揖唐判死刑后，昨日突由两律师，代表王逆以巨幅广告送刊各报。据谓：承审该案之审判长何承倬（现任河北高等法院刑庭庭长）系伪组织时期之司法官养成所教务主任，为其治下之小汉奸。并声明，王历次审讯一语不发，即由于此。盖在此汉奸法庭前受审，实心有不甘也。广告中并有云：“如谓唐系大汉奸，该审判长乃揖唐治下之小汉奸；值兹国土重光之后，审奸工作，竟假手于汉奸为之，天下后世，其谓今世为何世耶！揖唐政治上纵有‘错误’（？）但读圣贤书，凛明耻之训，深恐为中华民族审奸史留莫大之耻！揖唐所以历次审讯一语不发者，实有难言之隐痛，若竟于此汉奸法官手中受极刑，揖唐死不暝目。”
    这段广告刊出之后，世人皆惊，对此奇闻，无不瞪目伸舌。何承倬视此有失庭长尊严，赶紧发表谈话：
    “…彼仅在伪司法官养成所做过教授，‘教授是否汉奸，对于此举，本人惟以一笑置之。’”
    高等法院院长邓哲照，忽听有人“反噬”他的部下是汉奸，也觉有伤体面，随即辩护：
    “何，一向奉命在沦陷区任地下工作。”
    这一声明，比何承倬自己的辩护还扼要得多，堵住了所有人的嘴。汉奸审奸案，顿时就成了“地下工作者审汉奸。因为何承倬是‘国民革命军’‘元首’的‘地下工作’者，谁又能辨别叛逆王揖唐不是‘最高领袖蒋总裁’的同志呢？君不见：‘国土重光’后，各卖国奸贼全都是国民党的‘地下’人员么？”
    汉奸李英是国民党的“地下”总司令。
    汉奸吴化文，是“蒋介石的‘地下’集团军。”
    汉奸、土匪王自全、郭清、王泽民也全都是“总裁”的同志，升了不小的官。
    汉奸曾琦、汤＠铭等是蒋家猪仔“国大”的代表，公然替未来的总统登基撑场面。
    呜呼、汉奸之为用大矣哉！用汉奸来审判汉奸有什么稀奇！汉奸多和牛毛，而且公然袍登场，替蒋姓老贼踢斗门，跑龙套，这说明什么呢？一种解释是“好人不到蒋政府里来”。另一种是物以类聚，头子既然是菲律宾的罗哈斯，那么日美何择焉？卖国也要找专家啊！于是一切罪大恶极的祖国叛徒，全都披上了南京的“地下工作”者的罩衣，成了“中央”的自己人，“最高领袖”也是他们志同道合的“同志”了！那不也是理之当然！
    然而，受了汉奸糟踏的老百姓怎样说呢？豫北人民曾经这样的愤怒地唱着：
    骡拉着大车过去啦，
    水顺着漳河流来啦，
    郭清欠下的活人命呵，
    老天爷，
    他如今又当了“中央军”啦……
    可是，当了“中央军”便怎样？只要你戴了美式的宽边汉奸帽子来打内战压人民，人民就要一旅一旅地消灭你，缴你的枪。如果你再不甘心，利用些猪仔汉奸来开“国大”，造民意，公开卖国打内战，那人民也会揭掉你们的皮，把你们暴露在光天化日之下。无论你在“地下”卖给日本，地上卖给美国，最后总是逃不出人民的审判，决不会让你们“一笑置之”的。
