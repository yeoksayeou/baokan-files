Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. According to a Central News Agency report from Tianjin on the 3rd: Tianjin street vendors have gone on a general strike to protest the Kuomintang authorities' order to evict them. On the 2nd of this month, the Chiang-controlled Tianjin Municipal Government, on the pretext of "obstructing traffic," ordered the street vendors to immediately move from their concentrated area in the old concession market area to Zhang Zizhong Street. Upon hearing the news, the vendors, considering that the end of the year is approaching and that a move would result in significant losses, organized a petition group to appeal to the municipal government and the police bureau for a delay. However, the authorities refused, stating that "the decree has been finalized and must be executed," leading to a stalemate that has turned serious. The street vendors have gone on a general strike to express their protest.

　　天津摊贩罢市抗议蒋驱逐令
    【新华社延安四日电】据中央社三日天津讯：天津摊贩已以全体罢市，抗议国民党当局驱逐摊贩命令。本月二日，蒋记天津市政府借口“妨碍交通”，勒令摊贩自其集中地的旧区的租界市场一带立即迁至张自忠街。摊贩于闻讯后，以年关在即，一日迁移，损失必巨，乃组织请愿团赴市府及警察局请愿绥迁，但当局加以拒绝，谓“成命以收复，必须执行”，致问题由僵而转趋严重。摊贩已全体罢市，表示抗议。
