　　Oppressive Taxes and Levies Extorted as Actual Goods
  　The People of the Jiang-Occupied Areas in Eastern Hebei Suffer Bitterly
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] According to the Tianjin Yishibao, published on November 14th and 18th: The plight of the people in the "recovered areas" (referring to areas occupied by the Jiang army) of eastern Hebei is described as follows: "The people of various counties in eastern Hebei are burdened with heavy taxes and levies, and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition to the land tax collected as actual goods and forced loans, they must also pay monthly township and bao public expenses to cover the costs of local militias, public self-defense fees (including ammunition costs), and all kinds of inexplicable expenses, amounting to several thousand yuan per mu per month. Now, they are also conscripting soldiers, which is essentially hiring soldiers. In some counties, the cost of hiring soldiers is as high as tens of thousands of yuan per mu. Therefore, the common phenomenon in rural eastern Hebei is the selling of land and property. If someone is willing to pay the expenses (referring to oppressive taxes and levies) on their behalf, people will give away their land for cultivation for free. Isn't this a clear indication that the losses outweigh the gains? Thirty jin of millet can mortgage one mu of land, and five hundred jin of peanuts can buy one mu of land. At a time when prices for everything are soaring, the price of land in eastern Hebei is plummeting. If this abnormal phenomenon continues for another year, the fertile eastern Hebei will become an uncultivated wilderness. Uncultivated wasteland has already been discovered today!" The newspaper also reported on the situation of the so-called "self-defense teams" organized by the Jiang government, colluding with local bullies and gangsters to oppress the people, stating: The "self-defense teams" going from county A to county B or from village A to village B loot, beat, and scold the people, and fire guns arbitrarily, causing chaos and disturbance. The newspaper also stated: Because the countryside is unstable, most farmers are abandoning farming and joining the Eighth Route Army.

　　苛捐杂税拉丁征实
  　冀东蒋区人民苦不堪言
    【新华社延安一日电】据天津益世报十一月十四、十八两日刊载：蒋军侵占了的冀东人民苦况称：“冀东各县收复区（指蒋军侵占区）的人民，因负担苛重，农村势将破产，正在田赋征实征借不算，月月须交的乡保公费支应地方团队的花费，民众自卫费（包括枪弹费），以及一切无名的花费，每月每亩地数千元，现在又在征兵，实在是成为雇兵，有的县份每亩地竟摊派雇兵费万数千元。所以冀东农村普遍现象是拆卖田产，如果有人愿给代出花费（按指苛捐杂税）就有人白送地给种，这不是十足说明得不偿失吗？三十斤小米可典一亩地，五百斤花生可买一亩地，在百物高涨的现在，惟有冀东地价是一落千丈，这种反常的现象，如果再继续一年，肥沃的冀东或变成无人耕种的原野。今天已发现无人耕种的荒地了”！该报并报导蒋政府纠合恶霸流氓组织的所谓“自卫队”压迫人民的情形称：甲县到乙县或甲村到乙村去的“自卫队”，对民众劫掠打骂，任意放枪，弄得鸡犬不＠。该报并称：因为农村不安定，农民大多脱离农产去当八路军。
