    Mutual Teaching and Learning, Less Talk and More Action
    Feixiang Launches Winter Military Training
    Exercises with Stone Mines, Demonstrations and Parades
    Zanhuang Holds Militia Review
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Wei County, 9th] The people of Feixiang County are universally launching a winter military training campaign. The slogans are to raise political awareness, improve shooting, grenade throwing, and blasting techniques, and repel Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Based on local conditions, training is divided into three stages. The first stage involves simple military movements at the squad level. The second stage focuses on grenade throwing and landmine laying for the militia, grenade throwing for the self-defense forces, and the voluntary combination of village residents to practice martial arts. The third stage emphasizes shooting and aiming for the militia and the application and laying methods of landmines and grenades for the self-defense forces. The leadership also calls for the mass creation of diverse landmines to prepare for a widespread blasting campaign. The training adopts a "mutual teaching and learning between officers and soldiers" approach and the principle of "less talk and more action." The military training movement is now unfolding vigorously in various villages throughout the county.
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Changzhi, 9th] In light of Chiang's treacherous plots to covet the Pinghan Railway area, over 1,500 militiamen, who grew out of the land reform movement in the newly liberated area of Zanhuang, held a review meeting. Zhang, Staff Officer of the Sub-district, called on the liberated peasants to take up arms and resolutely defend the interests of their liberation. Zhang, Director of the Sub-district Military, called for: (1) Raising vigilance, constantly preparing for battle, and cooperating with the army to eliminate the enemy. (2) Strengthening joint defense, supporting each other, and striking at the returning landlord militias. (3) Launching a blasting campaign, using indigenous weapons, so that every village lays landmines and landmines detonate everywhere. (4) Strengthening fortification operations, learning mountain climbing, and the model battles of Donggao and other villages. (5) Launching a winter self-study and military training campaign to improve skills. (6) Launching a killing-the-enemy competition, striving to become enemy-killing heroes, establishing a merit record book, avoiding arrogance, and serving the people. Finally, Wang, Director of the County Military Department, spoke, saying that through a year of self-defense operations and the land reform movement, the people's armed forces in the newly liberated area of Zanhuang have greatly developed. The number of rifles alone has increased more than fivefold compared to last year. In the last four months, our liberated militiamen have fought independently 55 times, cooperated with the troops seven times, killing seven enemies, wounding thirteen, capturing nine, and seizing two rifles and pistols. The conference concluded with a stone mine exercise, awards, and an anti-civil war demonstration parade.
