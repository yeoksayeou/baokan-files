"National Assembly" Anecdotes

　　According to a report in the Nanjing People's Daily: On the night of the 7th of this month, the Kuomintang Central Cultural Movement Committee held a concert at the "National Assembly" auditorium to entertain "National Assembly" representatives and participating journalists. A journalist from the Kuomintang Peace Daily and "Representative" Song Yisuo argued over a seat. At the time, the "representatives" made a show of support for Song, and shouts erupted. Song took the opportunity to slap the journalist. On the 8th, the Peace Daily published a short commentary stating: "If the representatives believe that hitting is the best and most effective way to solve problems, why not propose that this method be included in the articles of the constitution?"

　　According to statistics from the Tianjin Dagongbao, the following people developed mental illness as a result of the "National Assembly": Li Huang hid away due to "brain pain," Lei Zhen politely declined the position of deputy secretary-general due to "insomnia," Shao Lizi declined to be a candidate for the presidium due to "headache," while Zhang Dongsun refused to go to Nanjing due to "stomach pain."

　　According to the aforementioned newspaper, "National Assembly" representative Li Zhuchen, after attending the opening ceremony, flew north to reorganize his factory. Before leaving, he gathered with people in the industrial sector and painfully recounted the difficulties he had in violating the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference to attend the "National Assembly," the reason being to try to save his business.

　　"National Assembly" representative Wang Kunlun did not attend due to "illness," and army representative Pan Wenhua did not attend due to "defense matters."

　　Long Yun was nominated by the Yunnan unit and was a candidate for the presidium. During Hong Lanyou's report at the meeting on the 21st, it was stated that the Yunnan unit only included Lu Han and Zhou Zhongyue, with no mention of Long Yun's name, nor was any reason given.

　　“国大”花絮
    据南京人报载：本月七日夜国民党中央文化运动委员会假“国民大会”礼堂举行音乐会，招待“国大”代表及与会记者，国民党和平日报记者某与“代表”宋宜宿因争座位发生口角，当时各“代表”为宋虚张声势，打声四起，宋趁势给该记者一耳光。八日和平日报发表短评称：“若果代表们认为打能解决问题，是最好最有效的办法，何不把这办法提议列入宪法条文中？”
    据天津大公报统计，因“国大”勾引起神经病者，计：李璜以“脑痛”而隐避，雷震以“失眠”婉辞副秘书长职，邵力子以“头痛”辞却主席团候选人；惟张东荪则以“胃痛”拒赴南京。
    据前报载，“国大”代表李烛尘参加过开幕式以后，即飞北方整顿他的工厂去了。临行前和工业界人士聚会时，沉痛叙述他不能不违反政协决议参加“国大”的苦衷，原因为企图救他的事业。
    “国大”代表王昆仑因“病”不出席，军队代表潘文华因“防务关系”不出席。
    龙云为云南单位推选及主席团候选人，二十一日会中洪兰友报告时，云南单位仅有卢汉及周钟岳两人，无龙云名字，亦未说明理由。
