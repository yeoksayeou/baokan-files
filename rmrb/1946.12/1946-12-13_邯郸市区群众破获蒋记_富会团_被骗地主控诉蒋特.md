    【This Newspaper, Handan News】The people of Handan City District, with high vigilance in the mobilization for war preparations, cracked down on the "Rich Association Group" special agent organization of Jiang, and crushed the conspiracy of Jiang's special agent leaders Li Qingxin, Chang Dequan and others to cooperate with Jiang's army in attacking Handan. The special agent leader of the "Rich Association Group," Li Qingxin, was originally a well-known traitor. After Japan surrendered, he sold himself to become a running dog of the Jiang bandits, sabotaged the liberated areas, spread rumors of regime change, and called himself the "District Chief" of the Kuomintang. His child was the "Inspection Team Leader." He used threats and inducements to force individual militiamen and farmers to serve as special agents. He said to the emancipated farmers: "The Farmers' Association is the heart of the Eighth Route Army, and the militia is the wings of the Eighth Route Army. When the Central Army comes, it will first dig out the heart and then break the wings." He induced the citizen Li Qingwen not to prepare for war and follow the Eighth Route Army, forcing him to be the squad leader of his son's "Inspection Team." However, Li's reactionary conspiracy was finally extinguished by the militia. On the 27th of last month, more than a thousand people in Zhangzhuangqiao District in the suburbs of the city held a public trial of Jiang's special agents. The deceived and misguided farmer Li Heizi painfully revealed the crimes of the "Rich Association Group": Li Qingxin spread rumors to scare the Farmers' Association: "Whoever digs up one of his trees will have to pay for a life! He told me to sell my land and cattle to pay for travel expenses to the South. I am a poor boy, and every time I don't attend the meeting, I have to be fined three catties of oil, forcing me to do things that are devoid of conscience." As he spoke, he couldn't help crying, and rushed up to beat Li in anger. Then a deceived landlord also confessed and revealed: Li invited him to drink, and asked him to "make a list of the fruits that the masses had settled," "If he didn't write it for him, the Jiang army would kill me when they came." A militiaman who had been bought over revealed the rumor that Jiang's special agents deceived and spread that "expanding the militia is the Eighth Route Army conscripting soldiers," and bitterly accused Li of using 20,000 yuan as bait to get him to kill the cadre Qin Shumei, but because Qin was vigilant, he did not succeed. Countless emancipated masses in Zhangzhuangqiao Ganhegou were filled with hatred for Jiang's special "Rich Association Group," and rose up to accuse Jiang's special agents of reactionary crimes. They demanded severe punishment for Jiang's special agents such as Li Qingxin and Chang Dequan, and continued to launch an anti-traitor movement to fight for defending Handan and defending the fruits of emancipation.
