Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 11th: Comprehensive reports from various news agencies indicate that the Greek civil war has spread like wildfire. Since December, the guerrilla forces have grown significantly, especially in the north, where they have paralyzed transportation in the Macedonia region, turning Salonika into an isolated port. A particularly significant development recently is the growth of guerrilla forces in the Thrace region. Rail traffic between Greece and Turkey has been severed since December, and the Turkish side has announced an extension of martial law in its western provinces for six months. The Greek government, on the one hand, repeatedly appeals to Britain for "immediate" provision of sufficient weapons to government troops, and on the other hand, fabricates many rumors to cover up its defeats, such as claiming that the guerrilla forces have been wiped out, and falsely accusing Yugoslav and Bulgarian troops of invading Greece. Regarding the latter, the governments of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have issued statements solemnly denying the accusations and protesting the repeated violations of Yugoslav and Bulgarian airspace by Greek aircraft.

    政府军请英火速支援
    【新华社延安十一日电】综合各通讯社消息：希腊内战已如燎原之势，十二月份以来，游击队声势有巨大增长，尤其是北部游击队，已使马其顿区的交通陷于麻痹，萨维尼亚已成孤港。近期特别有意义的发展是色雷斯区游击队的壮大。希腊与土耳其的铁路交通因是自十二月份起即告断绝，土方已宣布西部各省戒严延长六月。希腊政府一方面再三吁请英国“即时”以足量武器供给政府军，另方面制造许多谣言，以掩盖其败绩。如谓游击队已被消灭，以及诬蔑南斯拉夫、保加利亚军队侵入希腊等。关于后者南保两国政府已发表声明，郑重否认，并反对希机屡犯南保领空。
