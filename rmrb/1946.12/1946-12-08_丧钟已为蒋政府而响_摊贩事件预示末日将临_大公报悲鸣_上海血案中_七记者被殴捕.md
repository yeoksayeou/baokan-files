　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, December 5th: Following the disturbances among street vendors in Shanghai and the petition by five hundred street vendors in front of the Tianjin Municipal Government, the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao editorial on the 3rd pointed out that this is an extremely complex and serious problem. It includes the issue of large companies and stores instigating the municipal government to supplant the interests of street vendors, which in turn encompasses an economic problem of industrial and commercial depression. Secondly, many street vendors have fled from being drafted into the army and come to Shanghai, thus it is also related to the civil war. Furthermore, the goods sold by the street vendors are mostly smuggled American goods, therefore it includes the government's ability, efficiency, and disciplinary issues. Finally, the goods sold are purchased with black market foreign exchange, thus it also includes the government's financial and economic policies and management capabilities. The newspaper said: "The civil war is fought every day, refugees and the unemployed are suffering, foreign goods are pouring in, currency is constantly inflating, factories are closing down one after another, and shops are becoming increasingly depressed. The national economy and people's livelihood are in serious trouble. The Shanghai street vendor disturbance is an outbreak of a series of problems and also a microcosm of the nation's fate. If the war does not stop, there is no solution to the economic and financial problems, and the government does not pay attention to the people's livelihood, then the great disaster that will come in the future is unbearable to speak of." The Beiping World Daily, which is pro-Chiang government, also wrote on the same day that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, industry and commerce collapsed, rural areas went bankrupt, resulting in a large number of unemployed people concentrated in cities. In order to make a living, they had no choice but to set up stalls. The authorities, on the pretext of "rectifying the city appearance" and "improving traffic," banned them, cutting off their livelihoods, but turned a deaf ear to the more embarrassing matter of 170 poor people freezing to death overnight (referring to Tianjin). They also did not properly handle the more serious problem of trucks and jeeps killing people every day. The newspaper strongly refuted Wu Zhen's statement that "this case is obviously a planned disruptive action and has nothing to do with the street vendor problem," saying: "This is to deny the inappropriate measures taken by the authorities in the past to deal with this problem. 'The master is never wrong,' this will be the consistent style of Chinese bureaucrats." It also said: "If the authorities do not reflect on themselves and thoroughly reform the previous social and economic policies, but only resort to high-handed means against the people, then who dares to guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again."
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 5th: In the massacre of street vendors in Shanghai by the Chiang government on the 30th of last month and the 1st of this month, in order to cover up its crime of slaughtering the people, the Chiang government police beat and arrested seven reporters from various newspapers and news agencies who were covering the news, as well as several photographers, including reporters from official newspapers and news agencies. At that time, an American reporter who discovered two dead street vendor corpses and was taking photos was stopped by the police. This behavior of the Chiang government has aroused public outrage in all circles of Shanghai. According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 3rd, even the semi-official Shanghai Journalists Association has protested to the authorities about this.

　　丧钟已为蒋政府而响
  　摊贩事件预示末日将临
  　大公报悲鸣
  　上海血案中
  　七记者被殴捕
    【新华社北平五日电】自上海摊起骚动及天津五百摊贩在市府门前请愿事件发生后，天津大公报三日社论指出，这是极其复杂的严重性问题，其间包含着大公司商店怂恿市府取代摊贩与摊主利益冲突问题，亦即里面包含一个工商业萧条的经济问题。其次由于摊贩多为避免征抽壮丁而日沪的，因而这又与内战有关。再次摊贩们售悉为走私美货，因此它又包含着政府的能力与效能风纪问题。最后所售货物系依靠黑市外汇购进来的，故又包含政府之财政经济政策及管理能力等问题。该报说：“内战天天在打，难民及失业人群与逃役者颠沛困苦，外货源源而来，通货刻刻膨胀，工厂个个倒闭，商店日日萧条，国计民生整个成问题。上海摊贩的骚动，这是一连串问题的爆发，也是国家命运的缩影。战争再不停止，经济财政再无办法，为政者再不注意民生，则来日大难有不忍言者。”亲蒋政府的北平世界日报同日亦著论称：抗战胜利后，工商业倒闭，农村破产，造成了大量失业者集中都市的现象，他们为了糊口，只好摆摊，当局竟借口“整顿市容”，“改善交通”加以取缔，绝其生路，但对一夜冻死贫民一百七十口（指天津），这更为难看的事，却充耳不闻，对更严重的卡车、吉普车每天毙死人的问题，也并未加以妥当处理。该报对吴桢声明所谓“本案显为一有计划之捣乱行动反对与摊贩问题无涉”痛加驳斥称：“这是把当局过去处理这一问题的不当措施一笔勾销。‘老爷没有错’，这会是中国官僚的一贯作风。”并称：“假如当局再不反躬自省，彻底改革以往的社会经济政策，而只有以高压手段付诸人民，则类似的事件谁敢保不再发生。”
    【新华社延安五日电】在上月三十日及本月一日两日蒋政府上海摊贩的大屠杀中，蒋政府为掩盖其屠杀人民罪案，警察曾殴伤及逮捕各报及通讯社采访消息之记者七人及摄影记者数人，其中也包括官方报纸及通讯社记者。当时发现两具被杀死的摊贩尸首正在摄影之美国记者遭警察制止。蒋政府此种行为，已激动上海各界之公愤。据合众社上海三日电，对此甚至半官方的上海新闻记者协会亦已向当局提出抗议。
