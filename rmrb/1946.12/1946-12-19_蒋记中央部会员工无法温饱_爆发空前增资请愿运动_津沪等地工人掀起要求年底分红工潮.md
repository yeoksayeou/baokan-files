　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 16th: According to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th, the recent unprecedented large-scale petition movement by civil servants of Chiang Kai-shek's central ministries and commissions is due to soaring prices and the inability to afford basic necessities in the severe cold. Since the government adjusted civil servant salaries in August, it has remained silent and indifferent. Therefore, all civil servants jointly submitted a petition, unanimously signed, directly to Chiang Kai-shek, demanding an adjustment in treatment.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 15th: Simultaneously with the widespread worker strikes in Shanghai demanding year-end bonuses, all workers of the 33 units of the National Resources Commission under the Chiang government's administration in the Dagong Factory in Tianjin jointly requested wage increases from the factory at the beginning of this month to maintain their livelihood. However, the factory refused, and the strike continues. According to the Tianjin Yishibao on the 7th, Chiang Kai-shek's military and political authorities are paying close attention to this strike and are now closely monitoring the development of the event under the pretext of "preventing affecting local security."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 16th: United Press Shanghai, December 11th: According to news from the local Libao, Shanghai labor unions are planning to hold a large-scale parade demanding that the municipal government revise the limits on year-end bonuses. The government had stipulated that if employers made a profit, the maximum bonus would be equal to one month's salary. Five hundred workers gathered at the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau on the 10th to oppose the bureau's interference in their bonus demands. Shanghai police were dispatched to prevent serious incidents from occurring.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 16th: Thousands of employees of the Shanghai New New Department Store have been caught up in a strike wave demanding year-end bonuses. According to the Associated Press, they staged a sit-down strike because the management refused to pay the customary year-end bonus equivalent to one month's salary. On the 13th and 14th, the clerks politely asked customers to buy goods at other stores.

    【新华社延安十六日电】据中央社十三日电讯透露：最近爆发的蒋记中央各部会公务员空前的大规模请愿运动，系由于物价高涨，气候严寒已无法温饱。政府自八月份调整公务员薪资一次后，迄今不闻不问，故全体公务员共具请愿书，一致签名，已迳交蒋介石，要求调整待遇。
    【新华社延安十五日电】与上海广大工人掀起要求年终分红之工潮同时，蒋政府资源委员会所属在天津的大公厂之卅三个单位全体工人，于本月初联合向厂方要求增加工资，以维持生活。但厂方加以拒绝，工潮在继续中。据七日天津益世报透露：蒋记军政各方对此次工潮极为注意，现正借口“防止影响地方治安”，对事件之发展加以严密监视。
    【新华社延安十六日电】合众社上海十一日讯：据此间立报消息，上海工会方面正计划举行大规模的游行，要求市政府修改对年终分红的限度。政府曾规定如雇主获得盈利时，分红的最大限度为等于一个月工资之数，五百工人曾于十日齐集沪市社会局，反对社会局干涉他们分红的要求。沪市警察曾出动防止发生严重的事件。
    【新华社延安十六日电】沪新新百货公司员工千人，已卷入要求年终分红的罢工风潮。据美联社讯：彼等因资方拒绝按惯例发给一个月薪资的年终花红，实行静坐罢工。十三、十四两日，店员客气的请求顾客到别家商店买货。
