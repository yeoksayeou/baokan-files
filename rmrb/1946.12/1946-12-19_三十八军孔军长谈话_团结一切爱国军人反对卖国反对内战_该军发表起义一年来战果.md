　　Commander Kong of the 38th Army Speaks
　　Unite All Patriotic Military Personnel, Oppose Betrayal and Civil War
　　The Army Publishes Achievements of the Past Year Since Uprising
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 15th] On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the "Double Twelfth" Incident, reporters visited General Kong Congzhou and General Liu Weicheng, the commander and deputy commander of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army, who personally participated in this historical event. General Kong told reporters: "The national crisis caused by Chiang Kai-shek's misgovernment and betrayal of the country and American imperialism's aggression against China is no less than it was ten years ago today. Zhang Yang's eight major proposals still have new significance. The only policy of the 17th Route Army led by General Yang Hucheng that year was to unite all anti-Japanese military personnel to resist Japan and save the country. Now, as in the past, the only policy of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army is to unite all patriotic military personnel to oppose betrayal and civil war, and strive for democracy to save China. Generals Kong and Liu have also telegraphed Zhang Fuzhen, the commander of the 17th Division of the frontline troops, and all the commanders and fighters, instructing them to continue the victories they have won in commemoration of the great tenth anniversary of the "Double Twelfth" and resolutely fight to eliminate the invading Chiang troops.
　　[Special Report] To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the "Double Twelfth" Incident, General Kong Congzhou and Deputy General Liu Weicheng of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army recently told our reporter the results of the army's uprising against the civil war in the past year against the Japanese puppet and Chiang troops as follows: A total of 20 famous battles (14 of which were against Chiang troops), capturing more than 4,100 Japanese and Chiang soldiers, killing and wounding more than 600 Japanese and Chiang soldiers; seizing 5 large and small artillery pieces, 101 light and heavy machine guns, more than 1,000 various long and short guns, more than 50,000 rounds of ammunition, and 77 war horses; destroying one Chiang army train (in the Datong-Puzhou Campaign in January).
