Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 14th. "Labor News" today published a commentary entitled "The Overseas Chinese Question in Indonesia Must Be Resolved Fairly," expressing welcome and support for the proposal for a comprehensive resolution of the Overseas Chinese question put forward by PRC Foreign Minister Chen Yi in his letter to the Indonesian Foreign Minister on December 9th.

The commentary said that this proposal from the People's Republic of China is a just and reasonable plan to enable a satisfactory solution to the Overseas Chinese question in Indonesia that is in line with the interests of the people of both countries. The Chinese government's proposal on the Overseas Chinese question once again demonstrates the sincere efforts made by the Chinese government to defend and develop the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and is also another concrete manifestation of the peaceful diplomatic policy consistently implemented by the PRC government since its founding. The Chinese government's proposal conforms to the spirit of the Bandung Conference, and also fully conforms to the treaty on dual nationality issues signed between the two countries in April 1955 and the joint communique of the two foreign ministers issued during Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio's recent visit to China.

The commentary said that the unexpected anti-China activities recently launched in Indonesia have caused the Chinese people due concern. At the same time, this cannot but cause unease among all peace-loving people who respect friendly cooperation among Asian peoples. Because damaging the friendly relations between China and Indonesia is tantamount to damaging peace in Asia and the forces against imperialism and colonialism.

The commentary pointed out that the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism has received the active support and solidarity of the Asian people. This mutual support of the Asian people is an important guarantee for safeguarding the independence of Asian countries. In particular, China has provided strong support and cooperation whenever Indonesia has encountered difficulties on the road to safeguarding national independence.

The commentary said that, however, today, incidents of persecution of Overseas Chinese have occurred in some areas of Indonesia, which cannot but be said to be regrettable. Imperialists want to use it to create a split in the Asian people's anti-imperialist national liberation forces, in order to achieve their aggressive purposes. The imperialists also want to use it to achieve the purpose of clamoring against China and advocating "cold war," and as part of a plan to comprehensively intensify the international situation. It is clear that the anti-China activities and discriminatory measures against Chinese in Indonesia are not in line with the interests of the people of both countries from any perspective, but can only lead to consequences that are conducive to the imperialists' conspiracy. Therefore, we are delighted with the reasonable and fair plan repeatedly and sincerely proposed by the Chinese government for a comprehensive resolution of the Overseas Chinese question, and we hope that the dark clouds shrouding the relations between the two countries will be dispelled as soon as possible.

The commentary said that China and Indonesia are countries that have maintained friendly relations for a long time, guided by the spirit of the Bandung Conference and for the common interests of the struggle for peace and against imperialism, and there are no issues between them that cannot be negotiated.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”支持我对印度尼西亚华侨问题立场
    陈外长的建议符合万隆精神
    新华社平壤14日电　“劳动新闻”今天发表了一篇题为“必须公正解决印度尼西亚的华侨问题”的评论，表示欢迎和支持中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅在12月9日给印度尼西亚外交部长的信件中所提出的全面解决华侨问题的建议。
    评论说，中华人民共和国的这一建议，是使关于印度尼西亚的华侨问题能够符合两国人民的利益而得到圆满解决的一项公正和合理的方案。中国政府关于华侨问题的建议，又一次显示了中国政府为保卫和发展中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好关系所作的真挚的努力，也是中华人民共和国政府成立以来一贯执行的和平外交政策的又一个具体的表现，中国政府的这一建议符合万隆会议精神，也完全符合1955年4月两国之间签订的关于双重国籍问题的条约和最近印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约访问中国时发表的两国外长联合公报。
    评论说，最近在印度尼西亚掀起的出人意外的反华活动引起了中国人民应有的忧虑。同时这也不能不引起尊重亚洲人民间友好合作的一切爱好和平的人民的不安。因为损害中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系，就等于损害亚洲的和平和反帝国主义、反殖民主义的力量。
    评论指出，印度尼西亚人民的反帝国主义和反殖民主义的斗争，得到了亚洲人民的积极支持和声援。亚洲人民的这种互相支持是保卫亚洲各国独立的重要保证。特别是中国，每当印度尼西亚在保卫民族独立的道路上遇到困难的时候，都曾经给予强有力的支持和合作。
    评论说，然而，今天，在印度尼西亚一部分地区发生了迫害华侨的事件，这不能不说是令人感到遗憾的事情。帝国主义者想利用它来造成亚洲人民反帝国主义民族解放力量的分裂，以便达到他们的侵略目的。帝国主义者又想利用它来达到叫嚣反华、鼓吹“冷战”的目的，并且作为全面加剧国际局势的策划的一部分。很显然，在印度尼西亚发生的反华活动和排华措施，从那一个角度看也是不符合两国人民利益的，而只能引起有助于帝国主义者的阴谋的后果。所以，我们对中国政府为了全面解决华侨问题再三诚心提出的合理和公正的方案感到欢欣鼓舞，并且渴望早日吹散笼罩在两国关系上的乌云。
    评论说，中国和印度尼西亚两国是以万隆会议精神为指南的、并且为了和平和反对帝国主义的斗争的共同利益而长期以来维持了友好关系的国家，在他们之间没有任何不能协商的问题。
