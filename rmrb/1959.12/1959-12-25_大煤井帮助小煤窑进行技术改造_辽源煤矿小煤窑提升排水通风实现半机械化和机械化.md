Large Coal Mines Help Small Coal Pits with Technological Transformation
	Liaoyuan Coal Mine's Small Coal Pits Achieve Semi-Mechanization and Mechanization in Hoisting, Drainage, and Ventilation

	(Our report) The Liaoyuan Mining Bureau in Jilin Province adheres to the Party's policy of "walking on two legs," focusing on both large mines' large-scale, high-yield production and the consolidation, improvement, and technological transformation of small coal pits, transforming them from "small native groups" to "small foreign groups." Statistics up to the end of November show that the coal produced by small coal pits increased by 3.3 times compared to the total output of small coal pits throughout last year.

	After this year's consolidation and technological transformation, the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau's small coal pits were reorganized and merged from the initial eighty-one into seventeen. Following the principle of "comprehensive transformation, focusing on improvement," the Mining Bureau's electromechanical plant successively manufactured twenty-four winches (50 horsepower), more than thirty water pumps, and ventilators to equip the small coal pits. It also launched cooperation activities between large and small coal pits, mobilizing the workers of the small coal pits to vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, gradually carrying out technological transformation, and enabling hoisting, drainage, ventilation, and other aspects of the small coal pits to use mechanical equipment.

	With the increase in mechanical equipment in the small coal pits, production capacity is also rapidly improving. After the Xiancheng small pit installed major machinery such as water pumps, small mine locomotives, ventilators, and electric drills, the number of personnel was reduced by 35%, while the average daily output increased from over twenty tons before the transformation to 475 tons, an increase of more than twenty times. Monthly costs were reduced by more than 20,000 yuan compared to before the transformation. Labor productivity increased by more than one time. Coal quality met national requirements. Since the beginning of this year, basically eliminated minor injuries and above, achieved an all-round bumper harvest in output, quality, cost, safety, efficiency, and other aspects, and completed the annual national plan three months and seven days ahead of schedule.

	In strengthening enterprise management, importance is attached to balancing mining and excavation, emphasizing operations according to blueprint instructions, and establishing and improving various rules and regulations such as production meetings, safety activity days, pre-shift meetings, post-shift evaluations, and quality inspections, so that production is gradually becoming standardized.

	Recently, in formulating the 1960 plan, the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau has made appropriate arrangements to continue strengthening the transformation and improvement of small coal pits, so that the existing small coal pits will become fully mechanized and regular production mines. Furthermore, based on geological conditions, it will continue to implement the policy of "walking on two legs," opening up new small mines to meet the needs of the continued leap forward in the coal industry.

　　大煤井帮助小煤窑进行技术改造
    辽源煤矿小煤窑提升排水通风实现半机械化和机械化
    本报讯　吉林省辽源矿务局坚持党的“两条腿走路”的方针，一手抓大井的大面积高产，一手抓小煤窑的巩固、提高和技术改造，使小煤窑由“小土群”走向“小洋群”。到11月末统计，小煤窑生产的煤炭比去年全年小煤窑的总产量增加三点三倍。
    辽源矿务局小煤窑经过今年的巩固和技术改造，由年初的八十一个整顿合并成十七个。根据“全面改造，重点提高”的方针，矿务局机电厂先后制造了二十四台绞车（五十马力）、三十多台水泵和风机装备了小煤窑，并且在大井和小煤窑之间开展了协作活动，发动小煤窑的职工大闹技术革新和技术革命，逐步进行技术改造，使小煤窑的提升、排水、通风等都使用了机械设备。
    随着小煤窑机械设备的增加，生产能力也在迅速提高。仙城小井安设水泵、小马机、风机、电钻等主要机械后，人员减去了35％，平均日产量却由改造前的二十几吨增加到四百七十五吨，提高了二十多倍；月成本比改造前降低两万多元；每工效率提高了一倍以上；煤炭质量达到国家要求；今年以来基本上消灭了轻伤以上人身事故，做到了产量、质量、成本、安全、效率等全面丰收，提前三个月零七天完成了全年国家计划。
    在加强企业管理方面，重视采掘平衡，强调按图纸指示作业，建立和健全了生产会议、安全活动日、班前会议、班后评比、质量检查等各种规章制度，使生产逐步走向正规化。
    最近，辽源矿务局在制定1960年计划中，对继续加强小煤窑的改造和提高工作，已经进行了适当安排，使现有的小煤窑完全成为机械化的正规生产井，并且根据地质条件，继续贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，增开新的小井，以适应煤炭工业继续跃进的需要。
