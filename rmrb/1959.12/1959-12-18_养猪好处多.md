Raising pigs has so many benefits,
Like shooting three birds with one arrow,
Increasing fertilizer to ensure production,
Increasing income and more meat to eat.

　　＊　＊　＊

The pigpen is a treasure bowl,
If people let it, it will produce gold and silver,
Accumulating tens of thousands of cartloads of high-quality fertilizer,
Increasing grain production by billions of catties.

    养猪好处多
    养猪好处真是多，
    好比一箭射三雕，
    增积肥料保生产，
    收入加多肉食多。
    ＊　＊　＊
    猪圈是个聚宝盆，
    人能让它出金银，
    积下万车优质肥，
    增产粮食亿万斤。
