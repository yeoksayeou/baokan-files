Xinhua News Agency, December 19th. The joint Second National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Third Members' Representative Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce began their preparatory meetings in Beijing on the afternoon of the 16th of this month.

Nearly two thousand people attended and observed this conference. The preparatory meeting held on the 16th was presided over by Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, addressed the meeting on behalf the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, reporting on the tasks and guidelines for this joint congress of the two organizations.

The address pointed out: "The political task of this congress is to further enhance our understanding, boost our enthusiasm, transform ourselves better, and serve better through the study of the General Line and the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party."

The address first pointed out: "In the past great decade, under the encouragement and spur of the rapid development of the motherland, under the leadership and education of the Party, and under the driving and influence of the broad masses of working people, our industrialists and businessmen have, on the whole, made great progress. After the upsurge of socialist transformation in 1956, the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification movement from 1957 to 1958, and the Great Leap Forward and People's Communes movement since 1958, our socio-economic status has undergone fundamental changes, and our political and ideological outlook has also changed to varying degrees. The facts of the past decade show that most of us can gradually advance on the road of self-transformation; the facts of the past decade also show that our progress has been achieved in a process of constant repetition and twists and turns; the facts of the past decade particularly powerfully show that the leadership and education of the Party will always be the lighthouse guiding us to overcome negative factors and continue to move forward. Therefore, we must always remember and strive to practice what we often say, that is: listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party, and take the socialist road."

The address said: "This congress should continue to implement the spirit of gentle and subtle self-education. Through the enhanced awareness and joint efforts of the comrades, it should become a congress with a clear direction, rich content, a pleasant atmosphere, and in-depth results, a congress that, under the leadership of the Party, will unite and promote industrialists and businessmen across the country to better conduct self-transformation while actively serving."

In order to implement the spirit of this congress, the address emphasized the need to adopt a variety of methods, "listen, look, think, talk, and closely integrate practical education with ideological education." We should "more often use the method of grouping in threes and fives, freely combining, to facilitate intimate conversations and frank discussions, reflecting the common problems of the industrial and commercial sector as much as possible, fully exchanging views, and seeking appropriate solutions."

The address said: "The future of the country is infinitely bright, and our personal future is also very bright. We should be absolutely certain of this." "As long as we persevere in fundamental transformation and in serving socialism, we will surely receive encouragement from the Party and the state, shorten the distance between ourselves and the working people, and gradually transform ourselves into glorious laborers." The address concluded: "Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we must unite more closely around the Party and Chairman Mao, and take the Party's and Chairman Mao's earnest teachings, and the Party's general line for socialist construction, as the guide for all our thoughts, words, and actions, and advance along the bright road pointed out by the Party, constantly advancing."

This congress will also hear reports on the work of the two organizations, as well as conduct the re-election of the leadership of the two organizations and other agenda items. During the conference, the representatives will also listen to other reports and participate in visits and other activities in Beijing.

    推动工商业者更好改造和服务
    民建会和工商联代表大会举行预备会议
    新华社19日讯　联合举行的中国民主建国会第二次全国代表大会和中华全国工商业联合会第三届会员代表大会，本月16日下午开始在北京举行预备会议。
    出席和列席这次大会的近两千人。16日举行的预备会由中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通主持，中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培代表民建会中央委员会和全国工商联执行委员会在会上致词，报告了两会这次联合举行代表大会的任务和方针。
    致词中指出：“我们这次大会的政治任务，就是要通过对于总路线和中国共产党的八届八中全会精神的学习，使我们进一步提高认识，鼓足干劲，更好地改造，更好地服务。”
    致词中首先指出：“在过去伟大的十年里，我们工商业者，在祖国一日千里的发展形势的鼓舞和鞭策下，在党的领导和教育下，在广大劳动人民的带动和影响下，总的说来，也得到了很大的进步。经过1956年的社会主义改造高潮，1957年到1958年的反右派斗争和整风运动，以及1958年以来的大跃进和人民公社化运动，我们的社会经济地位发生了根本的改变，政治思想面貌也起了不同程度的变化。十年来的事实表明：我们中的多数人在自我改造的道路上是能够逐步前进的；十年来的事实又表明：我们的进步是在不断地反复、曲折过程中取得的；十年来的事实特别有力地表明：党的领导和教育，永远是引导我们克服消极因素、继续前进的灯塔。因此，我们要永远记住和努力实践我们经常讲的一句话，那就是：听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，走社会主义道路。”
    致词说：“这次大会应当继续贯彻和风细雨的自我教育的精神，通过同志们的提高自觉和共同努力，成为一次方向明确、丰富多采、心情舒畅、效果深入的大会，一次在党的领导下团结、推动全国工商业者更好地在积极服务中进行自我改造的大会。”
    为了贯彻这次大会的精神，致词中强调要采取多种多样的方法，“听听，看看，想想，谈谈，把实际教育和思想教育密切结合起来”。要“更多地采用三三五五、自由结合的方法，便于大家亲切谈心，畅所欲言，把工商界带有普遍性的问题，尽量反映出来，充分交换意见，求得适当的解决。”
    致词中说：“国家的前途无比美好，我们个人的前途也十分光明，对于这一点，我们应当确信无疑。”“只要坚持不懈地进行根本改造，坚持不懈地为社会主义服务，我们就一定能够得到党和国家的鼓励，缩短同劳动人民的距离，就一定能够逐步改造成为光荣的劳动者。”致词最后说：“回顾过去，展望将来，我们一定要更紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围，把党和毛主席给我们的恳切教导，把党的社会主义建设总路线，作为我们一切思想、言论、行动的指针，沿着党所指引的光明大道前进，不断地前进。”
    这次代表大会还将听取两会的会务报告，以及进行改选两会领导机构等议程。会议期间，代表们还将在北京听取其他报告和进行参观等活动。
