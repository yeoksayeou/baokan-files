Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: 1959 was a year in which the struggle of the awakened African people for national independence surged vigorously.

    Nigeria's "West African Pilot" said not long ago, "Now, nothing can stop the tide of African nationalism. From Algiers in Algeria to the Cape of Africa, the mountains of Kenya, the plains of Rhodesia, and the lakes of Nyasaland, the roar of nationalism has produced a tremendous echo."

    An important feature of the African situation this year is the surging and overlapping mass anti-colonial rule struggles of the African people. In the Congo, the struggle of the Congolese people, currently centered around opposing the Belgian authorities' plan to hold sham "elections" in December and implement the deceptive plan of so-called "phased independence," is entering a new climax. In Nyasaland, an even more intense struggle against the British colonists began at the end of January. Despite the extremely cruel suppression by the British authorities, the large-scale resistance of the people of Nyasaland continued until March.

    Faced with the violent suppression of the colonialists, the people who are striving for national independence in the form of armed struggle have achieved new victories and developments this year. The Algerian national independence war has just entered its sixth year. Today, the star and crescent flag of the Republic has been planted on two-thirds of Algeria's territory, and the 130,000 national liberation fighters are becoming stronger and stronger. They expose de Gaulle's conspiracy to induce surrender and are determined to persist in the struggle until they achieve genuine autonomy and independence. In Cameroon, the people's armed forces, which have persisted in their struggle for several years, have put the French colonists in a state of panic.

    In order to maintain their rule over the colonies forever, the colonialists are accustomed to adopting tactics of instigating discord and "divide and rule." However, the African national independence movement is constantly strengthening unity to deal with the common enemy - imperialism. In various struggles carried out by the African people, such as opposing France's nuclear test in the Sahara and opposing racial discrimination in South Africa, they support each other and echo each other, making these struggles a mighty movement.

    The African people have received sincere and selfless support from socialist countries in their just struggle for national independence. At the United Nations and other international conferences, on "Africa Freedom Day," "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" and other anniversaries of solidarity with the struggles of the people in various regions of Africa, socialist countries and their people stand on the side of the African people, giving them strong political and moral support. Socialist countries also provide some newly independent African countries with unconditional economic and technical assistance to help them develop their national economies and get rid of the economic backwardness caused by long-term colonial rule. The African people know how to distinguish between enemies and friends.

    In 1960, four more countries in Africa—Nigeria, Togo, Cameroon, and Somaliland—will gain independence. The African people will stride into 1960 at an even greater pace.

### 从大西洋岸到印度洋滨　从阿尔及尔到好望角  非洲民族解放斗争烈火燎原

    从大西洋岸到印度洋滨　从阿尔及尔到好望角
    非洲民族解放斗争烈火燎原
    据新华社30日讯　1959年是觉醒的非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争蓬勃高涨的一年。
    尼日利亚的“西非向导报”不久前说，“现在，什么东西也不能阻挡非洲民族主义的浪潮。从阿尔及利亚的阿尔及尔到非洲的岬角，怯尼亚的高山、罗得西亚的平原、尼亚萨兰的湖泊，民族主义的巨响产生了巨大的回音。”
    这一年非洲局势中的一个重要特征是非洲人民大规模的、群众性的反殖民统治斗争汹涌澎湃、此起彼伏。刚果目前环绕着反对比利时当局打算在12月间举行虚伪“选举”和推行所谓“分阶段独立”的欺骗性计划，刚果人民要求立即实现独立的斗争正在进入新的高潮。在尼亚萨兰，从1月底开始发生了更为激烈的反抗英国殖民者的斗争。尽管英国当局进行了极其残酷的镇压，但是，尼亚萨兰人民的大规模抵抗一直持续到3月间。
    面对殖民者的暴力镇压，以武装斗争形式来争取民族独立的人民在这一年中取得了新的胜利和发展。阿尔及利亚的民族独立战争刚刚进入第六个年头，今天，在阿尔及利亚三分之二的国土上已经播上了共和国的星月旗，十三万民族解放军战士愈战愈强。他们揭露戴高乐诱降的阴谋，决心坚持斗争直到获得真正的自治和独立为止。在喀麦隆，坚持了几年斗争的人民武装使法国殖民者陷入了惶惶不安的境地。
    殖民者为了永远保持他们对殖民地的统治，惯于采取挑拨离间、“分而治之”的策略。但是，非洲民族独立运动不断加强团结，来对付共同敌人——帝国主义。在非洲人民进行的各种斗争中，例如反对法国在撒哈拉试验原子弹、反对南非的种族歧视，他们互相支持，互相声援，使这些斗争蔚为声势浩大的运动。
    非洲人民在他们争取民族独立的正义斗争中得到社会主义国家真诚而无私的支持。在联合国和其他国际会议上，“非洲自由日”、“帝国主义滚出非洲日”和其他声援非洲各地区人民斗争的纪念日，社会主义各国和这些国家的人民站在非洲人民一边在政治上道义上给予非洲人民有力的支持。社会主义国家对于一些新取得独立的非洲国家，还给予不附带任何条件的经济技术援助，帮助它们发展民族经济，摆脱长期殖民统治所造成的经济落后的状态。非洲人民懂得如何区别敌人和朋友。
    1960年，在非洲又将有四个国家——尼日利亚、多哥、喀麦隆、索马里兰取得独立。非洲人民将以更大的步伐跨进1960年。
