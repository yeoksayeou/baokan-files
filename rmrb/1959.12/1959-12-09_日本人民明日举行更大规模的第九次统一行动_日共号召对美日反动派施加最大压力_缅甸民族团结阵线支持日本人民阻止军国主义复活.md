Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 8th: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party has distributed leaflets across the country, calling on all Japanese people to launch the ninth national unified action scheduled for December 10th to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and strive for victory.

The leaflet points out that the eighth unified action against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has already sparked a high tide of mass action across the country, and this struggle is currently facing an important period.

The leaflet indicates that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is illegally suppressing democratic forces and attempting to violate the constitution by enacting laws restricting demonstrations and marches in order to forcibly sign a new "Security Treaty." At the same time, U.S. President Eisenhower issued a statement on December 2nd supporting the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's revision of the "Security Treaty."

The leaflet states that on the day of the ninth national unified action against the revision of the "Security Treaty," the Japanese Socialist Party and the Communist Party will jointly submit a motion to the Diet demanding an immediate halt to the U.S.-Japan negotiations for revising the "Security Treaty." Workers, centered around the coal miners' union, the National Railway Workers' Union, and the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, will hold strikes and take other mass actions in their respective workplaces.

The leaflet calls on all workers, working people, and citizens to cooperate with these actions, hold rallies in various locations, resolutely demand an immediate halt to the U.S.-Japan negotiations for revising the "Security Treaty," oppose Kishi Nobusuke's "visit to the United States" plan, oppose the suppression and enactment of laws restricting demonstrations and marches, and submit protests and demands to the U.S. government, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and the Japanese Diet.

The leaflet also calls on all Japanese people to strengthen solidarity with all democratic forces, including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and strive to expand the organization of the common struggle. The leaflet calls on the people not to be influenced by provocateurs but to fight the enemy with organized mass action and exert maximum pressure on the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

The leaflet calls on all Japanese people who demand Japan's security, independence, peace, and neutrality to strive for victory and launch the ninth unified action to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 7th: The National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in Japan decided today that the ninth unified action against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," scheduled to be held on the 10th, should be the largest in scale among the past series of unified actions against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The action plan adopted at a meeting of the organization's secretariat in Tokyo today stated that workers will hold larger strikes than in the past, and people from other classes will also take large-scale actions to support the workers.

The action plan explained that while conducting the ninth unified action, the Socialist Party will also submit a proposal to the Diet demanding an immediate halt to the negotiations for revising the "Security Treaty." The plan calls on member organizations of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty" to fight against the government's persecution of participants in the eighth unified action.

According to the decision, the National Council will cooperate with a large number of petitioners sent to Tokyo on December 10th by local National Councils Against Revision of the "Security Treaty," farmers' groups, and women's organizations. Petitioners from various regions and leaders of national organizations with representatives on the National Council's secretariat will hold a joint meeting on the day of the unified action and issue a statement supporting the Socialist Party's motion to halt negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" and protesting the government's persecution of people petitioning the Diet.

With the support of the National Council, 50,000 workers will hold a march and demonstration in Tokyo.

The National Council also decided today to hold a mass rally on December 16th, as the Supreme Court is scheduled to make its final judgment on the "Sunagawa Incident" on that day.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 8th: According to Rangoon newspapers today, the Presidium of the Burmese National United Front recently passed a resolution at a meeting, expressing strong opposition to the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and firmly supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of this treaty.

The resolution pointed out that the purpose of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries in revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is to revive Japanese militarism and attempt to establish military bases throughout Asia.
