    Seize the Time for Winter Irrigation

    This year, a lot of wheat has been planted, and planted well. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, a large number of water conservancy projects have been built across the country. Our current task is to utilize the existing water conservancy projects to provide winter irrigation to the wheat that has been planted in large quantities and well, so that it can grow stronger and better, and lay a solid foundation for a bumper summer harvest next year; it is to use the existing water conservancy projects to irrigate all the fields that can be winter-irrigated, so as to prepare better conditions for spring sowing next year. There are many benefits to winter irrigation. Winter irrigation of wheat has the functions of storing water and preserving moisture, and increasing ground temperature; it can not only protect seedlings and consolidate roots, so that wheat can safely overwinter, but also provide the necessary moisture for the growth and development of wheat after it turns green in the coming spring, and promote wheat germination and tillering. Experiments over the past few years have proved that winter irrigation of wheat can generally increase production by more than 10%. Winter irrigation of uncultivated land can also store water and preserve moisture, ensuring timely sowing and robust emergence of spring crops next year. Expanding the area of winter irrigation is also a good way to stagger water use times, reduce water use pressure next spring, and give full play to the role of water sources. Finally, the wheat is generally well-planted this year, with deep plowing, close planting, and sufficient fertilizer, which requires more water to adapt. The "Eight-Character Charter" is an interconnected and mutually restrictive whole, and many measures must be closely integrated to better exert the effect of increasing production. The abundant harvest practices of last year and this year show that under the conditions of deep plowing, close planting, and heavy fertilization, there are new requirements for irrigation water for wheat fields. In the past, it was considered good to achieve "three waterings and five fertilizations" for wheat fields, but now it is felt that this standard is too low. In the Yellow River Basin, fertile wheat fields generally need to be watered seven or eight times, and general fields also need to be watered five or six times to adapt to the requirements of deep plowing, close planting, and heavy fertilization. Therefore, it is of great significance to do a good job in winter irrigation at present.
    There are many favorable conditions for carrying out winter irrigation this year. Since the Great Leap Forward, a large number of irrigation projects have been built across the country, which provides a strong material foundation for winter irrigation. According to investigations by relevant departments, existing water conservancy construction can irrigate 86% of the wheat area. Secondly, in conjunction with autumn plowing and autumn turning, various places have vigorously carried out land leveling, ditching and garden-style field work. Incomplete statistics from six provinces including Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, and Shaanxi show that the area of leveled and trenched fields accounts for 80% of the wheat planting area, of which the garden-style field area accounts for about 60% of the wheat planting area, which creates favorable conditions for accelerating winter irrigation and improving the quality of winter irrigation. In addition, the facts of high yield through winter irrigation over the years have not only created many valuable irrigation experiences, but also improved people's understanding of winter irrigation. Since this summer and autumn, many places have experienced prolonged droughts, which has strengthened the determination of people in various places to strive to eliminate drought and have already taken action. According to recent statistics, winter irrigation of wheat fields in Hebei Province has accounted for 48%, the area of winter irrigation of wheat fields in Shandong Province has increased by 45% compared with the same period last year, and Gansu has winter-irrigated more than 12 million mu of land. We should make full use of these many favorable conditions, actively lead the masses, and do a good job in winter irrigation work centered on watering wheat. The key to doing a good job in winter irrigation lies in strengthening leadership, uniformly arranging labor, and tapping labor potential from various aspects. For example, in Xiaowang Commune, Yongnian County, Hebei Province, more than 7,000 laborers were invested in key water conservancy projects, and diversified operations and fertilizer accumulation and other production also occupied a large part of the labor force, but they took various measures such as running canteens and nurseries to fully tap the labor potential, and the number of people invested in winter irrigation reached more than 10,000. Agricultural departments and water conservancy departments should be closely integrated and take effective measures quickly, taking advantage of the great opportunity of nighttime freezing and daytime thawing to launch a shock movement and rapidly push winter irrigation to a new climax.
    Winter irrigation is a work with a strong sense of time and must be completed before freezing. Past experience has also proved that early winter irrigation can increase production more. Especially this year, many areas have been dry for a long time, and early winter irrigation is even more important in the case of drought-resistant sowing. At present, the temperature is gradually decreasing, and the freezing period is approaching quickly. It is hoped that all localities will be full of energy and do everything possible to universally irrigate the fields that should be winter-irrigated once or twice, so as to lay a good foundation for a greater harvest of summer crops next year.

### 抓紧冬灌

    抓紧冬灌
    今年小麦种得多种得好。几年来特别是大跃进以来，各地修了大量的水利工程。当前，我们的任务是怎样利用已有的水利工程，给种得又多又好的小麦进行冬灌，使它长得更壮更好，为明年的夏季大丰收打好基础；是怎样利用已有的水利工程把能够进行冬灌的田地都浇灌一次，为明年春播准备下更好的条件。冬灌的好处多得很。小麦冬灌，具有储水保墒、提高地温、的作用；既能保苗盘根，使小麦安全越冬，又为来春小麦返青后的生长发育提供必要的水分，促进小麦的发苗分蘖。几年来的试验证明：小麦冬灌一般都能增产10％以上。白地冬灌，也可以储水保墒，保证明年春播作物的适时下种，出苗齐壮。扩大冬灌面积，还是一个错开用水时间、减少明春用水压力、充分发挥水源作用的一个好办法。最后，今年小麦普遍种的好，深耕、密植、肥料充足，这就需要更多的水来适应。“八字宪法”是一个互相联系、互相制约的整体，许多措施必须密切结合，才能更好地发挥增产作用。去年和今年的丰产实践表明：在深耕、密植、多肥的条件下，对麦田的灌溉用水有了新的要求。过去认为对麦田做到“三水五肥”就很好，现在已经感到这个标准太低了。黄河流域的丰产麦田一般要浇七、八次，一般田也要浇五、六次，才能适应深耕、密植、多肥的要求。因此，在当前抓好冬灌工作，有着十分重大的意义。
    今年开展冬灌工作，有许多有利的条件。大跃进以来，各地修建了大量的灌溉工程，这就为冬灌提供了有力的物质基础。据有关部门调查，现有水利建设可以灌溉小麦面积的86％。其次，各地结合秋耕和秋翻，大力开展了平地打畦和园田化的工作。河北、河南、山东、山西、甘肃、陕西六省不完全统计，平整筑畦的面积已占小麦播种面积的80％，其中园田化面积约为小麦播种面积的60％，这就为加速冬灌、提高冬灌质量创造了良好条件。此外，历年冬灌丰产的事实，不仅创造了许多宝贵的灌溉经验，而且提高了人们对冬灌的认识。今年夏秋以来许多地方长期干旱，更加强了各地人民力争消灭干旱的决心，并且已经行动起来。据最近统计：河北省冬灌麦田已经占48％，山东省冬灌麦田面积比去年同时增加45％，甘肃已冬灌地一千二百多万亩。我们应该充分利用这许多有利条件，积极领导群众，作好以浇麦为中心的冬灌工作。搞好冬灌的关键，在于加强领导，统一安排劳力，从多方面来挖掘劳动潜力。例如河北永年县小汪公社投入水利建设重点工程的劳力七千多人，多种经营和积肥等生产又占去了很大一部分劳力，但他们采取各种办法如办好食堂、托儿所等，充分挖掘劳动潜力，投入冬灌的人数达到一万多人。农业部门和水利部门应当密切结合，迅速采取有效措施，趁此夜冻日消的大好时机，开展一个突击运动，把冬灌迅速推向新的高潮。
    冬灌是一个有强烈时间性的工作，必须抢在封冻之前完成。历年的经验也证明，早冬灌可以更多增产。尤其在今年，不少地区长期干旱，在抗旱播种的情况下，早冬灌就显得更加重要。目前气温逐渐下降，封冻期很快逼近。希望各地鼓足干劲，千方百计把应该冬灌的田地普遍灌水一、二次，为明年夏季作物的更大丰收奠定良好基础。
