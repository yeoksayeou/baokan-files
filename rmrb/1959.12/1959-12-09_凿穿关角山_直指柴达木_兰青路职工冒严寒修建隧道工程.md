Xinhua News Agency report: The harsh winter has arrived on the Qinghai Plateau, and the workers constructing the Guanjiao Pass tunnel on the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway are battling the wind and snow to accelerate construction. Currently, more than one-third of the tunnel's main structure has been completed, with over 1,400 meters of the tunnel formed.

The Guanjiao Pass tunnel is located at the foot of the Guanjiao Mountain in the Qaidam Basin west of Qinghai Lake, 350 kilometers from Xining. It is a crucial project for the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway as it advances from Xining towards the Qaidam Basin.

Construction of the Guanjiao Pass tunnel began in September of last year. The workers of the Xining Railway Bureau, who were building the tunnel, waged a tenacious struggle against floods, rocks, and cemented soil. On one occasion, a large amount of floodwater gushed out of a spring inside the tunnel, with a discharge rate of more than 700 tons per hour. In order to prevent the more than 300 meters of completed tunnel from being washed away by the water, the workers braved the cold and rushed into the water to block the spring. After five days and nights, they finally subdued the flood.

The Party organization in the work area is very concerned about the lives of the workers. The kitchen has come up with many ways to vary the meals and send the food directly to the construction site in insulated vehicles. Health workers and supply and marketing personnel also carry medicine kits and push carts to the construction site and workers' dormitories. All of this has boosted the workers' enthusiasm for production.

    凿穿关角山　直指柴达木
    兰青路职工冒严寒修建隧道工程
    据新华社讯　严冬已经来到了青海高原，修筑兰青铁路关角垭口隧道的人们正在和风雪奋战加紧施工。目前，隧道的主体工程已经完成三分之一以上，成峒一千四百多米。
    关角垭口隧道位于青海湖西柴达木盆地关角山麓，距西宁三百五十公里，是兰青路由西宁向柴达木挺进中的一个关键工程。
    关角垭口隧道去年9月开始施工。修筑隧道的西宁铁路局职工同洪水、岩石和胶结的泥土进行了顽强的斗争。有一次，大量的洪水从洞中泉眼急涌而出，出水量达每小时七百多吨。为了避免砌好的三百多米成峒被水冲坏，职工们不顾寒冷冲到水里去堵泉眼，经过五天五夜，终于制伏了洪水。
    工区的党组织很关心职工的生活。伙房想出许多办法来变换饭菜花样，并且用保温车把饭菜直接送往工地。卫生员、供销员也都背上药箱，推上货车，到工地和工人宿舍去。这些都鼓舞了职工的生产情绪。
