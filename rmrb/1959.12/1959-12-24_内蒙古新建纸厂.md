Recently, twenty-eight newly built paper mills and paper-making workshops in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been put into production. Since the paper-making workshop of the Hailar City Fur Factory and the paper-making workshop of the Hohhot City Printing Factory were put into operation, the average daily output has reached 75 percent of the designed capacity, and the quality of the paper meets the requirements.

In the Yellow River, Liao River basins, and vast grassland pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, dense reeds, Miscanthus, and other plants suitable for papermaking grow, and there are also a large number of rice straw and wheat straw in rural areas that can be used for papermaking.

    内蒙古新建纸厂
    内蒙古自治区最近有二十八座新建造纸厂和造纸车间投入生产。海拉尔市皮毛厂造纸车间和呼和浩特市印刷厂造纸车间投入生产以来，平均日产量达到设计能力的百分之七十五，纸张的质量合乎要求。
    在内蒙古黄河、辽河流域和广大草原牧区，生长着茂密的芦苇、龙须草等可供造纸的植物，农村中也有大量的稻秸和麦秸可用来造纸。
