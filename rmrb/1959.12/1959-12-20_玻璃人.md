    Glass Man

    In Newsreel No. 67, a report covered the first glass human body model manufactured in our country.
      The glass man is installed with electric equipment on the chassis, and the human body can move freely. There are also one hundred and forty-eight small light bulbs installed in the body, representing one hundred and forty-eight acupuncture points. When each small light bulb representing an acupuncture point flashes, a pre-recorded tape simultaneously emits sound, providing specific and necessary explanations of the acupuncture point. This is a rather complex glass man, and it is a new contribution to the development of China's medical cause, and of great value especially to acupuncture science.
    It was successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai State-owned Medical Model Factory with the specific assistance of the Shanghai Acupuncture Research Institute. Its successful trial production marks the victory of the staff's daring to think and act, and bold creation spirit; it marks a new achievement in China's medical model industry.

    玻璃人
    在新闻简报六十七号中，报道了我国制造的第一座玻璃人体模型。
      玻璃人的底盘上，安装有电动设备，人体可以自由活动。体内还装有一百四十八个小灯泡，表示一百四十八个针灸穴位。当每个代表穴位的小灯泡闪光时，事先装好的录音磁带，同时发出声音，对穴位能进行具体的必要的解释。这是一座结构相当复杂的玻璃人，它对我国医学事业的发展是一个新的贡献，特别是对针灸科学，具有重大价值。
    它是上海国营医学模型厂在上海市针灸研究所的具体帮助下，试制成功的。它的试制成功，标志着工作人员的敢想敢干、大胆创造精神的胜利；标志着我国在医学模型工业上的新成就。
