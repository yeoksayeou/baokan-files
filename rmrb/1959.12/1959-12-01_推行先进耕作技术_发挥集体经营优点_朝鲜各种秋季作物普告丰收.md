Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang Electric Dispatch: This autumn, North Korea has achieved an all-around bumper harvest of various crops. Large areas have seen high yields of rice, corn, cotton, flax, oilseed crops, and apples. Particularly noteworthy is the significant increase in yield per unit area compared to previous years.

Currently, the autumn harvest in various agricultural cooperatives is complete, and efforts are being concentrated on threshing and distribution. They are also summarizing the experience of this year's bumper harvest to prepare for agricultural production next year.

This autumn, the rice in North Korea grew very well. The Namri Plain, the Twelve-Thirteen Thousand Li Plain, and the Jeongju Plain on the west coast, and the Hamju Plain on the east coast, major rice-producing areas in North Korea, have all achieved rare bumper harvests. The yield per unit area in these places is even higher than last year's unprecedented bumper harvest. The Namri Agricultural Cooperative in the Namri Plain, South Hwanghae Province, planted 1,100 jeongbo (one jeongbo is approximately 15 mu) of rice, with an average yield of 6.5 tons per jeongbo, an increase of 1.5 tons per jeongbo compared to last year.

Corn, known as the "King of Dryland Crops" in North Korea, has achieved large-scale bumper harvests this autumn, both in the plains and in the mountainous areas. In Uiju County, south of the Yalu River, the yield per unit area of the 7,760 jeongbo of corn planted increased by 50% compared to last year.

Cotton, flax, and various oilseed crops have all achieved bumper harvests in North Korea this year. In the main cotton-producing areas in North Korea, such as South Hwanghae Province and South Pyongan Province, many agricultural cooperatives have achieved cotton yields of around three tons of seed cotton per jeongbo.

This autumn's bumper harvest of crops in North Korea is due to the active implementation by agricultural cooperatives of the deep plowing, close planting, and increased fertilization methods proposed by the Workers' Party of Korea. Last autumn and this spring, most of the rice paddies and dry fields were deeply plowed to about 30 centimeters. Last winter and this spring, farmers launched a manure accumulation campaign, accumulating several times more compost than in previous years and applying it to the fields. In addition, reasonable close planting was implemented, with an average of 250 to 270 seedlings per pyeong (200 pyeong is one mu) in rice paddies.

Last winter, North Korea also merged the original small agricultural cooperatives into large cooperatives. Over the past year, the large cooperatives have demonstrated their superiority, constructing a large number of water conservancy and irrigation projects, and utilizing land and various resources in a unified and rational manner, ensuring the bumper harvest of various crops.

### 推行先进耕作技术　发挥集体经营优点  朝鲜各种秋季作物普告丰收

    推行先进耕作技术　发挥集体经营优点
    朝鲜各种秋季作物普告丰收
    据新华社平壤电　朝鲜北部今年秋季各种农作物获得全面丰收。水稻、玉米、棉花、亚麻、油脂作物和苹果各地都出现大面积的丰产，特别突出的是单位面积产量较往年有显著的提高。
    目前各地农业社秋收已经完毕，正在突击进行脱谷、分配；并总结今年的丰产经验，为明年的农业生产进行准备。
    今秋朝鲜的水稻长得很好。西海岸的那慕里平原、十二三千里平原、定州平原和东海岸的咸州平原等朝鲜北部主要的水稻产地都获得罕见的丰收。这些地方的单位面积产量比去年的空前大丰收还高。黄海南道那慕里平原上的那慕里农业社所种的一千一百町步（一町步约合十五亩）水稻，平均每町步的产量达六点五吨，每町步的平均单位面积产量比去年还多一吨半。
    在朝鲜被称为“旱田作物之王”的玉米，今秋无论在平原或者在山区都获得了大面积丰产。鸭绿江南岸的义州郡内种的七千七百六十町步玉米，单位面积产量比去年增加了50％。
    棉花、亚麻和各种油脂作物今年在朝鲜各地都获得了丰收。朝鲜北部主要产棉区黄海南道和平安南道等地有许多农业社的棉花产量达到每町步产籽棉三吨左右。
    今秋朝鲜农作物大丰收是由于各农业社积极贯彻了朝鲜劳动党提出的深耕、密植、多施肥等耕作方法。去年秋天和今年春天，各地的水田、旱田大部分深耕了三十厘米左右。去冬今春农民们展开积肥运动，积了比往年多好几倍的堆肥施到田里。另外，实行了合理密植，水稻密植平均每坪（二百坪为一亩）插秧二百五十至二百七十兜。
    去年冬天朝鲜还把原来的小农业社并成大社。这一年来，大社发挥了它的优越性，兴修了大量的水利灌溉工程，统一地合理地利用土地和各种资源，保证了各种农作物的丰收。
