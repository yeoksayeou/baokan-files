Xinhua News Agency, Okinawa, December 4th: U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Kiewitt openly clamored that the United States should continue to occupy Okinawa Island as a base for U.S. military aggression in the Pacific region.

During a press conference held on the "Hancock" warship near Okinawa on the 2nd, Kiewitt admitted that Okinawa would be destroyed in a nuclear war. However, disregarding the Japanese people's demand for the return of Okinawa Island and the safety of the Okinawan people, he insisted that the United States must maintain Okinawa as an aggressive military base. He said that losing the island would be a "first-class disaster," and that "this island is invaluable as an outpost for the 15,000 men of the U.S. Marine Corps Third Division and land-based aircraft, which can quickly reach any area in the Far East where small wars occur."

He advocated further strengthening the U.S. military presence in Okinawa. He said, "I would like to see at least three aircraft carriers here regularly, more submarines, and a whole Marine division on Okinawa Island instead of two-thirds of a division." He also touted the role of U.S. bases in Japan in U.S. aggressive military activities in the Far East. He said that Japanese bases allow U.S. ships to be repaired without having to cross the ocean, thus greatly enhancing the efficiency of the Seventh Fleet.

Kiewitt arrogantly boasted about the U.S. Seventh Fleet, and deliriously fantasized that the Seventh Fleet could "kill" our country's action to liberate Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 4th: U.S. Secretary of the Army Brucker said on the 3rd while speaking at a gathering initiated by the National Association of Manufacturers that the United States must maintain "the concept of retaliatory power, foreign aid, and collective security (referring to forming military blocs)." He said he believed these were "necessary measures" for the United States.

Brucker also said that the U.S. Army is now stationed in approximately seventy countries and overseas regions, and that these troops stationed abroad are "absolutely indispensable."

    美国第七舰队司令叫嚣
    继续霸占冲绳作侵略基地
    据新华社4日讯　冲绳消息：美国第七舰队司令基维特公开叫嚣美国要继续霸占冲绳岛作为美国在太平洋地区进行军事侵略的基地。
    基维特2日在冲绳附近停泊的“汉科克号”军舰上举行记者招待会时，承认冲绳将在一次核战争中被消灭，但是，他不顾日本人民对于收回冲绳岛的要求和冲绳人民的安危，坚持美国要保持冲绳作为侵略军事基地。他说，失去这个岛屿将是“头等的灾难”，“这个岛屿作为供美国海军陆战队第三师一万五千人和以陆地为基地的飞机使用的前哨基地来说，是无价之宝，这些飞机可以很快地到远东任何发生小型战争的地区去。”
    他主张进一步加强驻在冲绳美国军事力量。他说，“我希望至少有三艘航空母舰经常在这里，有更多的潜艇，并在冲绳岛上有一整个海军陆战师而不是一个师的三分之二。”他还鼓吹美国在日本的基地对于美国在远东的侵略军事活动的作用。他说，日本基地使美国舰只不需要横越大洋去修理，因而使第七舰队的效率大大加强了。
    基维特狂妄地为美国第七舰队吹嘘，梦呓第七舰队可以“杀死”我国解放台湾的行动。
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美国陆军部长布鲁克3日在全国制造商协会发起的一个集会上讲话时说，美国要保持“报复力量、对外援助和集体安全（指拼凑军事集团）的概念”。他说，他认为这对美国都是“必要的措施”。
    布鲁克还说，美国陆军现在驻扎在大约七十个国家和海外地区里，这些驻在国外的部队是“绝对不可少”的。
