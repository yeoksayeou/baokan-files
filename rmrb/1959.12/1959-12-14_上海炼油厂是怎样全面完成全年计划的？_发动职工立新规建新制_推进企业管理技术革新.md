Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 13th: The Shanghai Refinery, an advanced collective attending the National "Heroes' Meeting," has resolutely relied on the masses this year to continuously improve its enterprise management and technological level, vigorously engaging in the comprehensive utilization of crude oil. This has promoted a comprehensive and sustained high tide in production. It has already comprehensively completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule. As of December 8th, the production plans for gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil, kerosene, petroleum coke, and other products have all been completed or exceeded. The total output value plan was completed ahead of schedule on November 26th. From January to November, costs decreased by 6.88% compared to the entire year of last year, and labor productivity increased by 14.2% compared to the same period last year. The profit delivery plan has also been completed ahead of schedule. The quality of various petroleum products has been greatly improved. At the same time, more than seventy new products, such as petroleum ether, capacitor vaseline, and viscosity paint additives, have been trial-produced and manufactured, greatly exceeding the new product trial production plan. Since the third quarter, safety work has been greatly strengthened, and accidents have been reduced. Due to the rapid improvement of technical level and the comprehensive leap forward in production, the value created from one ton of crude oil has also risen step by step. Compared with November and the first quarter, one ton of crude oil has played the role of one and a half tons.

    The Shanghai Refinery Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted a serious study at the beginning of this year on how to further implement the Party's General Line and continue the comprehensive leap forward. The Party Committee unswervingly implemented the principle of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements, continued to thoroughly break down the erroneous view among cadres of relying only on a few people to engage in production in a cold and cheerless manner, and vigorously establish the correct view of believing in and relying on the masses; continued to thoroughly break down unreasonable old rules and regulations that restricted the production enthusiasm of the masses, and vigorously establish new rules and regulations that could adapt to and promote the continuous high tide of mass production enthusiasm and the continuous comprehensive leap forward in production.

    The Shanghai Refinery is a large-scale modern chemical enterprise, and the main equipment is continuous production units. An accident in one link will affect the production of the entire plant, requiring a highly centralized production management system. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the workers broke through the old and unreasonable rules and regulations and also established some new systems; at the same time, they implemented the decentralization of management power, worker participation in management, and cadre participation in labor. However, some cadres did not have a solid understanding of whether such a complex modern enterprise could rely on the masses to do a good job in production. Therefore, when some temporary abnormal phenomena appeared in production management in the first quarter of this year, their thinking about mass movements wavered.

    The Party Committee resolutely implemented putting politics in command and convened an enlarged meeting in May to launch ideological struggle; at the same time, it mobilized all the factory workers to speak out freely and post big-character posters targeting enterprise management issues. At the enlarged meeting of the Party Committee, the method of presenting facts and reasoning was adopted, and all the rules and regulations of the factory that had been broken and not broken were studied one by one and debated. After this debate, various erroneous views were refuted, and the following conclusions were made on the mass movement since last year: First, since last year, mobilizing the masses to participate in management and breaking down and establishing rules and regulations has achieved great results, with very few shortcomings. It is entirely good, not "terrible." Second, the responsibility for the temporary abnormal phenomena in production management in the first quarter of this year does not lie with the workers, but with the leadership and the work of the departments not keeping up with the new situation of the development of the mass movement. Some newly established systems were not well implemented; the leadership and relevant departments did not seriously study which of the more un-broken rules and regulations should continue to be applied and insisted on, and which were not suitable, mobilizing the masses to break them down and establish new systems. Third, precisely because the leadership has not kept up, especially because some cadres' thinking on vigorously launching mass movements is not firm, and they have not yet organized and helped the masses to do a good job in management work, the mass movement must be carried out in depth.

    After the enlarged meeting of the Party Committee, the mass movement was carried out more deeply and widely. The leaders of the factory and various departments immediately took action, convening professional meetings and symposiums combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians, relying on the masses to continue to break down and establish rules and regulations on a large scale, and merging and revising the seventy-four old systems of the factory into eleven new systems in a short period of time, and management work was quickly strengthened.

    The Party Committee then, according to the production characteristics of the refinery, seized the link of technical management, continued to vigorously mobilize the masses to participate in management work, and combined the mass movement in enterprise management with the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The entire factory has established three new forms in technical management, making the "three-way combination" of cadres, workers, and technicians in technical management and technical innovation movements more regular, institutionalized, and mass-based.

    These three management forms are:

    First, a regular system for mass participation in daily technical management. That is, regular meetings attended by workshop directors, technicians, team leaders, and veteran workers are held every morning and every Monday to formulate basic operating indicators and precautions for each day and week. Workers in each team insist on holding pre-shift and post-shift meetings to deploy and inspect the production of the team; serious implementation of the shift handover system between teams. In operation, workers continue to be given the power to flexibly control temperature, pressure, and flow within a certain limit.

    Second, between two production cycles, the task of comprehensively summarizing production experience and formulating improvement measures is changed from a few technicians in the past to all the workers and masses, and then discussed and approved at the workers' congress of the entire workshop. The factory director, engineers, and cadres of relevant departments also attend. Therefore, the periodic production summary has become a powerful weapon to promote the mass technical innovation upsurge.

    Third, irregularly convene "three-way combination" special technical research meetings to specifically solve major technical problems that cannot be solved by daily technical management and periodic summaries. The research meetings are attended by the factory director, engineers, department cadres, and workers of various relevant types of work. After a solution is obtained at the meeting, measures and implementation dates are set and included in the daily work plans of the relevant departments and workshops, and completion is checked regularly.

    By grasping technical management, the entire situation has been driven forward, and the masses are more proactive and enthusiastic in carrying out labor competitions, engaging in technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale. The workers in each workshop competed to trial-produce new products and used self-made indigenous equipment for production, forming a mass upsurge of comprehensive utilization. In order to improve labor productivity, the workers of the entire factory learned multiple technologies and launched a multi-skilled worker movement. Refinery workers learned multiple technologies such as maintenance, installation, chemical testing, and instrumentation. Repair workers and transportation workers built their own equipment and vigorously carried out the mechanization of manual operation and manual handling, saving a large amount of manpower to support new product production and established six satellite factories. The labor force that originally needed to be increased this year was completely saved. Due to further mobilizing the workers to participate in enterprise management, the work of the departments has also been enriched and improved.

    上海炼油厂是怎样全面完成全年计划的？
    发动职工立新规建新制  推进企业管理技术革新
    据新华社上海13日电　出席全国“群英会”的先进集体上海炼油厂，今年坚决依靠群众不断提高企业管理水平和技术水平，大搞原油综合利用，促使生产全面地、持续地高涨，已经全面提前完成了今年的国家计划，到12月8日止，汽油、柴油、润滑油、灯油、石油焦等各项产品的产量计划都已完成或超额完成。总产值计划早在11月26日就提前完成了。1月到11月份的成本比去年全年降低6.88％，劳动生产率比去年同期提高14.2％。上缴利润计划也已提前完成了。各项石油产品的质量大大提高，同时试制和生产了石油醚、电容器凡士林、粘度漆加剂等七十多种新产品，大大超过了新产品试制计划。第三季度以来，安全工作大大加强，事故减少。由于技术水平迅速提高，生产全面跃进，从一吨原油中创造的价值也步步上升，以11月份和第一季度相比，一吨原油已发挥了一吨半的作用。
    中共上海炼油厂委员会今年年初就对如何进一步贯彻党的总路线、继续全面跃进作了认真的研究，党委坚定不移地贯彻执行集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，继续在干部中大破只依靠少数人冷冷清清搞生产的错误观点，大立相信群众、依靠群众的正确观点；继续大破束缚群众生产积极性的不合理的旧规章制度，大立能够适应和促进群众生产积极性持续高涨和生产不断全面跃进的新的规章制度。
    上海炼油厂是个大型的现代化化工企业，主要设备都是连续生产装置，一个环节出事故就会影响全厂生产，需要有高度集中的生产管理制度。去年大跃进中，工人群众冲破了旧的不合理的规章制度，也立了一些新的制度；同时实行了管理权力下放、工人参加管理、干部参加劳动。但是，一部分干部对这样复杂的现代化企业是否可以依靠群众搞好生产，认识上并不巩固。因此，当今年一季度生产管理上出现一些暂时的不正常现象的时候，他们思想上对群众运动便发生动摇。
    党委会坚决实行政治挂帅，在今年5月间召开了扩大会议，展开思想斗争；同时发动全厂职工针对企业管理问题大鸣大放，贴大字报。党委扩大会上，采取摆事实讲道理的作法，将全厂所有破与未破的规章制度一项一项地研究，进行辩论。经过这场论战，驳倒了各种错误观点，并对去年以来的群众运动作出以下的结论：一，去年以来发动群众参加管理，大破大立规章制度，成绩很大，缺点很小，完全是好得很，不是“糟得很”。二，今年第一季度生产管理上一度出现局部的不正常现象，其责任不在工人，而在领导和科室工作没有跟上群众运动发展的新形势。一些新立的制度没有很好地贯彻；对更多的未破掉的规章制度，领导和有关科室没有认真研究哪些继续适用，坚持执行，哪些不适宜，发动群众破除并建立新制度。三，正因为领导没有跟上，特别是部分干部对大搞群众运动思想还不坚定，还没有很好组织群众、帮助群众搞好管理工作，因此群众运动还必须深入开展。
    党委扩大会议后，群众运动更深更广地开展起来了。厂的领导和各科室立即行动起来，分别召开领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合的专业会议和座谈会，依靠群众继续大破大立规章制度，短期内把全厂七十四种旧制度，合并修改为十一种新制度，管理工作迅速得到加强。
    厂党委接着根据炼油厂的生产特点，抓住技术管理这个环节，继续大力发动群众参加管理工作，把企业管理方面的群众运动和技术革新、技术革命运动结合起来。全厂在技术管理方面已建立起三种新形式，使干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”的技术管理和技术革新运动更加经常化、制度化、群众化了。
    这三种管理形式是：
    一，经常性的群众参加日常技术管理制度。即每天早上和每星期一举行有车间主任、技术人员、班长、老工人参加的例会，制订每天、每周的基本操作指标和注意事项。各班工人坚持举行班前班末会议，布置和检查本班的生产；各班之间认真贯彻交接班制度。在操作上继续给工人在一定限度内灵活掌握温度、压力、流量的权力。
    二，两个生产周期之间，由过去少数技术人员改为由职工群众全面总结生产经验，制定改进措施，然后在全车间职工大会上进行讨论通过。厂长、工程师和有关科室干部也出席。因此周期生产总结，成为推动群众性的技术革新高潮的一个有力武器。
    三，不定期地召开“三结合”专题技术研究会，专门解决日常技术管理和周期总结所不能解决的重大技术问题。研究会有厂长、工程师、科室干部和各有关工种的工人参加。会上得到解决办法后，就订出措施与实现日期，列入有关科室和车间的日常工作计划，定期检查完成。
    纲举目张，抓住技术管理这一环节，就带动了全面，群众更加主动积极地全面开展劳动竞赛，大搞技术革新和技术革命，各车间工人竞相试制新产品，并自制土设备进行生产，形成了群众性的综合利用高潮。为了提高劳动生产率，全厂工人学习多种技术，展开多面手运动，炼油工人学会维修、安装、化验、仪表等多种技术，机修工人和运输工人自造设备大闹手工操作、人工搬运机械化，节约了大批人力支援新产品生产，办了六个卫星工厂。原来今年需要增加的劳动力完全节省下来。由于进一步发动工人群众参加企业管理，也丰富和提高了科室工作。
