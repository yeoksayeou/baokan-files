Relying on the Masses, Using Simple Means, Vigorously Running Construction Site Factories
Yingshan Basically Achieves Self-Sufficiency in Water Conservancy Construction Materials

Chengdu, December 18th (By Our Reporter) Sichuan's Yingshan County, based on the principle of self-reliance, mobilized the masses to vigorously run "Eight Factories and Two Stations" (iron and wood factory, saltpeter factory, sulfur factory, explosives factory, lime factory, cement factory, tile pipe factory, and bamboo ware factory, as well as a tool repair station and a transportation station). Except for a small amount of steel, high-grade cement, and ammonium nitrate explosives, the county can achieve self-sufficiency in materials needed for water conservancy construction. After the full-scale construction began, hundreds of steel cable carts, flatbed carts, automobiles, and wooden boats continuously transported various materials and equipment to the construction sites. This enabled the water conservancy construction sites to use carts to transport soil and stones, wooden rail trains to excavate soil for dam construction, derricks for lifting in deep trenches, and large-scale blasting for chiseling rocks. Advanced technologies were widely adopted in the main processes, which increased work efficiency several times, saved millions of labor days, and enabled the Qianli Long Canal, originally planned to be completed in three years, to be basically completed in four months.

At the beginning of the vigorous effort to run "Eight Factories and Two Stations," a small number of people disregarded the great power of the masses, emphasized objective difficulties, and wanted to rely solely on state-provided materials and equipment. The Yingshan County Party Committee led the people of the county in a debate on "For whom are we building water conservancy projects? How can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results?" and "Relying solely on the state, or working together to overcome difficulties?" which unified everyone's thinking. Then, the county, districts, and communes allocated the tasks of producing materials at each level, and a surge of vigorously running the "Eight Factories and Two Stations" formed throughout the county.

Factories and stations needed raw materials. How to solve this problem? Based on the suggestions of the masses, three main methods were adopted: "finding, making, and donating." "Finding" meant fully exploring and utilizing various resources throughout the county. They looked for common raw materials, and also for substitute raw materials; they looked for bulk raw materials, and did not neglect various minor raw materials. At the same time, following the principle of setting up factories wherever there were raw materials, many cement, explosives, saltpeter, lime, and other factories were built throughout the county. "Making" meant using indigenous methods to manufacture raw materials for saltpeter, explosives, cement, etc. The county produced more than 700,000 jin of raw materials for saltpeter using indigenous methods. "Donating" meant mobilizing the masses to donate or sell various raw materials. Within a few days, the people of the county donated and sold more than 50,000 jin of scrap copper and iron.

In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient technical manpower, Yingshan County adopted the following methods: widely appealing to technical personnel to return to their posts combined with short-term training, masters teaching apprentices combined with the widespread introduction and promotion of advanced experience, and combining local experience with experience from other places. First, experienced veterans who were familiar with the technology were selected from the masses, and training courses were established with the veterans as the backbone to train a large number of new forces. On the one hand, old factories and veterans were assigned to be responsible for providing specific technical guidance to new factories and novices. On the other hand, various forms such as on-site meetings were used to widely and promptly promote advanced experience. In addition, the county often sent people to visit and study in other places. After taking the above measures, the county selected and trained more than 9,000 technical workers such as ironworkers, carpenters, saltpeter boilers, explosives mixers, and cement makers, which met the needs of running factories on a large scale.

In terms of factory equipment, Yingshan County also implemented the principle of diligence and thrift by using simple means. If there were no factory buildings, they used old houses or built their own thatched sheds; if there were no ball mills for making cement, they used water mills and stone rollers instead; they made their own iron pots and built their own stoves; with little or no cash, hundreds of factories were established.

Transportation stations and tool repair stations were widely established in Yingshan County after the large-scale establishment of factories in order to transport the scattered materials to the construction sites and to repair damaged tools in a timely manner. In terms of transporting materials, Yingshan County adopted three methods: bringing materials along when going to work, bringing materials along when providing reinforcements, and organizing a large number of vehicles and boats to centrally transport materials with five transportation stations as the center. When transporting by vehicles and boats, they also implemented simultaneous canal repair, navigation, and road construction (the banks of the large canals were three meters wide, allowing cars to pass), so that wherever the canal was repaired, the materials would be delivered, which not only guaranteed the supply, but also greatly saved transportation manpower. The seventy-six repair stations distributed on the construction sites enabled the water conservancy construction tools to be repaired in a timely manner.

### 依靠群众　因陋就简　大办工地工厂  营山水利建设器材基本自给

    依靠群众  就地取材  勤俭办水利！
    依靠群众　因陋就简　大办工地工厂
    营山水利建设器材基本自给
    本报成都18日电　四川营山县根据自力更生的原则，发动群众大办“八厂两站”（铁木厂、土硝厂、硫磺厂、炸药厂、石灰厂、水泥厂、瓦管厂和竹器厂，工具修配站和运输站），除了少数钢铁、高标号水泥和硝?炸药等外，这个县水利施工所需物资都能做到自给自足。在全面动工以后，每天有数百部钢丝车、大板车、汽车和木船，源源不断地把各种物资器材运上工地。使各水利工地运土运石能用车子，筑坝取土用木轨列车，深沟起重用吊杆，凿石开方大爆破，各主要工序广泛采用了先进技术，工效成倍提高，节省了上百万个劳动日，使原计划三年完工的千里长渠，在四个月内就基本建成。
    在大办“八厂两站”开始时，曾有少部分人无视群众的巨大力量，强调客观困难，想单纯依靠国家援助物资器材。中共营山县委领导全县人民就“兴修水利为谁？怎样才能做到多快好省？”“单纯依赖国家，还是大家动手克服困难？”等展开辩论，使大家的思想得到统一。然后，县、区、公社层层分配了生产物资的任务，一个大办“八厂两站”的热潮在全县形成了。
    办厂、办站需要原材料，如何解决？根据群众建议，主要采用了“找、制、献”三个办法。“找”，就是在全县范围充分发掘和利用各种资源。找通用的原料，又找代用原料；找大宗原料，又不忽略各种小宗原料。同时按照哪里有原料，就在哪里设厂的原则，在全县建起了许多水泥、炸药、土硝、石灰等厂。“制”，就是用土办法制造土硝、炸药、水泥等的原料，全县用土法制出的土硝原料就有七十多万斤。“献”，就是发动群众捐献或出售各种原材料。在几天内全县人民献出和售出的废铜废铁，在五万斤以上。
    为了解决技术力量不足的困难，营山县采用的办法是：广泛号召技术人员归队与短期训练相结合，师傅带徒弟与普遍介绍推广先进经验相结合，本地经验与外地经验相结合。首先在群众中选调熟悉技术的老手，以老手为骨干，开办训练班，大量培训新生力量；一方面由老厂和老手分工负责，给新厂、新手以具体的技术指导，一方面利用现场会等多种形式，广泛及时地推广先进经验。此外，县里还经常派人到外地参观学习。采取以上措施后，这个县选调和培训出铁工、木工、熬硝工、配炸药工、制水泥工等技术工人九千多名，适应了大办工厂的需要。
    在建厂设备方面，营山县也贯彻执行了因陋就简的勤俭原则。没有厂房，就利用旧房或自盖草棚；制水泥没有球磨机，用水碾、石滚代替；自烧铁锅，自修炉灶；不用或只用很少现金，成百的工厂就开办起来了。
    运输站和工具修配站，是营山县大办工厂后，为了把分散的物资运上工地，和及时修理破损工具而广泛建立的。在运输物资方面，营山县采取了上工时自带、增援时捎带，和以五个运输站为中心组织大批车、船集中输送等三个办法。车、船输送时，还实行边修渠、边通航、边通车（大渠埂宽三米，可以通行汽车），做到水渠修到哪里，就把物资送到哪里，既保证了供应，又大大节省了运输力量。分布在工地上的七十六个修配站，使水利建设工具得到及时修理。
