Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 9th. To help agricultural middle school teachers in suburban counties improve their teaching skills, Shanghai Normal College has established a correspondence department and a mobile tutoring teacher group.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, each commune in the suburban counties of Shanghai has basically established an agricultural middle school. The scale of the schools has gradually expanded. An agricultural middle school now has approximately four to five hundred students and a dozen teachers, and subject-based teaching and research groups have also been established. However, the vast majority of these agricultural middle school teachers are graduates of senior high schools or secondary vocational schools, without teacher training and lacking teaching experience, and therefore urgently need help to solve these problems.

In response to this situation, the Correspondence Department of Shanghai Normal College publishes a correspondence publication, "Agricultural Middle School Teachers' Correspondence Communication," once a month. It has now reached its third issue, and its contents include the Party's guidelines and policies for agricultural middle schools, analysis of teaching materials for various courses in agricultural middle schools, introductions to teaching reference materials, as well as exchanges of teaching experience and discussions and answers to questions related to agricultural middle school teaching.

In order to solve some specific problems that cannot be solved by correspondence, the Correspondence Department has also organized teachers from the Chinese, Mathematics, Biology, and Educational Psychology Research Offices to form a mobile tutoring teacher group, which goes to suburban counties to tutor agricultural middle school teachers through seminars and classes. Before tutoring, the Correspondence Department and individual teachers from each department first go to agricultural middle schools to deeply understand the situation, so that the tutoring work is more in line with the actual needs of agricultural middle school teachers.

Shanghai Normal College will also organize some fourth-year students to intern in agricultural middle schools, so that they can gain practical experience in teaching and help agricultural middle school teachers improve their professional skills in terms of professional knowledge.

    帮助农业中学教师提高业务
    上海师范学院成立函授科和巡回辅导教师团
    新华社上海9日电　上海师范学院成立函授科和巡回辅导教师团，帮助郊区各县农业中学教师提高教学业务水平。
    去年大跃进以来，上海市郊各县每个公社基本上都办了一所农业中学，学校规模逐步发展，一所农业中学大约已有四、五百名学生，十几个教师，还成立了分科教研组。但是，这些农业中学教师绝大多数是高中或中等专业学校毕业生，没有受过师范专业教育，又缺乏教学经验，因此迫切需要帮助解决。
    上海师范学院函授科，根据这一情形，每月出版一次函授刊物“农业中学教师函授通讯”，目前已出到第三期，内容包括党对农业中学的方针政策和指示，农业中学各门课程的教材分析、教学参考资料的介绍，以及教学经验交流和有关农业中学教学的问题讨论和解答等。
    为了解决函授中不能解决的一些具体问题，函授科又组织中文、数学、生物和教育心理研究室教师成立巡回辅导教师团，到郊区各县采取开座谈会和上课等方式巡回辅导农业中学的教师。辅导前，函授科及各系个别教师先到农业中学深入了解情况，使辅导工作更切合农业中学教师的实际需要。
    上海师范学院还将组织部分四年级学生到农业中学实习，使他们获得教学工作的实际经验，并从专业知识方面帮助农业中学教师提高业务水平。
