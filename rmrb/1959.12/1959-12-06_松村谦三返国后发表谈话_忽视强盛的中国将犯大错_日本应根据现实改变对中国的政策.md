Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 3rd: Liberal Democratic Party advisor Kenzō Matsumura returned to Tokyo on the afternoon of December 2nd after a month and a half visit to China at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai.

About two hundred political figures, including Takeo Miki of the Liberal Democratic Party and Inejirō Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, welcomed him at the airport.

Matsumura gave a talk at a press conference held at Tokyo International Airport. He said that Japan would be making a serious mistake if it did not take into account the existence of such a strong and modernized neighbor as China.

He said, "China now appears before Japan as a great nation, and Japan should change its policies based on this reality." He said, "After holding talks with Premier Zhou Enlai, I strengthened my judgment that if both sides understand each other's positions without infringing upon each other, then Japan and China can conduct exchanges in culture and economics."

Matsumura also said, "I believe that if the situation can develop in this way, then diplomatic relations between the two countries can be adjusted. I think that mutual respect and mutual trust of non-aggression are probably the main issues that should be the focus of consultation in the future." He said, "I am willing to work hard to achieve the above points in the future."

Regarding China's economic construction, Kenzō Matsumura said that although he took a critical attitude when he visited China, it must be admitted that China's economic construction has made tremendous progress recently. He said that as someone who knows the old China, he was amazed to see the Chinese people working vigorously on construction.

He mentioned that during his visit to China, he visited fifteen factories, ten reservoirs, five people's communes, and twenty-six schools and museums.

He said that Chinese industry is quite developed. In terms of culture, efforts are being made to protect ancient culture. China is full of a lively atmosphere.

Matsumura said, "Large-scale projects such as building reservoirs and planting trees are being carried out everywhere. In any case, it is difficult for us to underestimate the strength of the new China."

Matsumura also said, "In particular, their national consciousness and enthusiasm for scientific research impressed me." He said, "Due to the national consciousness of the Chinese people and their enthusiasm for science, significant progress has been made in industrial equipment, reservoir construction, education, and cultural facilities. In particular, they seem to be committed to the popularization of people's communes and the construction of railways and power stations. Through all of this, I deeply feel that China has become an outstanding modern country. I believe that the Japanese government and people should correctly recognize the reality of communist China in order to adopt a China policy that does not lag behind reality in international and domestic affairs."

Regarding the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," he said that because he had been away from Japan for fifty days, he did not want to express his opinion on this issue. However, he said that when Foreign Minister Aiichirō Fujiyama answered questions in the Diet session regarding the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," he raised issues such as the dispatch of U.S. troops to the Far East, which seemed to have greatly stimulated the Chinese people.

On the evening of the 2nd, Matsumura also gave a talk on Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) radio, expressing his gratitude to the Chinese side for their hospitality. He said, "We deeply feel the following points in particular: Seeing that China is on the road to outstanding construction, we feel that this is gratifying for the establishment of friendly relations between Japan and China, and we also feel that Japan and China need to join hands to work for the prosperity of Asia and world peace. We intend to accurately convey what we have seen and heard to the Japanese people and strive for the establishment of friendly relations between Japan and China as soon as possible."

On the evening of the 2nd, Kenzō Matsumura and his entourage, Yūtarō Takeyama, also spoke to reporter Takeo Takagi about their impressions of their visit to China. Matsumura said, "China has indeed changed. It can be said that it has changed its face. I think it can be said that even people's expressions have changed." He said, "We hope that through our trip, if we can sow seeds for the establishment of friendly relations between the two countries, although we don't know when they will be established, we will be happy."

Yūtarō Takeyama also praised the high speed of China's construction.

Matsui, a special correspondent for Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) who accompanied Kenzō Matsumura on his visit to China, mentioned that during this visit, the Chinese side attacked the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's policy of hostility towards China. He said that their severity regarding the (Kishi Nobusuke government's) revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was unimaginable to the Japanese people. When he talked about the situation of China's economic development, he said, "China in five or six years will be remarkable." He said that the Chinese People's Communes guarantee the food and clothing of the peasants, which is a great thing.

    松村谦三返国后发表谈话
    忽视强盛的中国将犯大错
    日本应根据现实改变对中国的政策
　　新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本自由民主党顾问松村谦三2日下午从中国回到东京。他应周恩来总理的邀请，在中国作了一个半月的访问。
　　到机场欢迎他的有自由民主党的三木武夫，社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎等政界人士约二百人。
　　松村在东京国际机场举行的记者招待会上发表谈话。他说，日本如果不考虑到像中国这样一个强大而现代化的邻国的存在，它将犯严重的错误。
　　他说，“中国现在以巨大的国家出现在日本的眼前，日本应该根据这种现实改变政策。”他说，“我同周恩来总理举行会谈后，加强了这样的判断：即如果互相了解对方的立场而不互相侵犯的话，日中两国可以在文化和经济方面进行交流。”
    松村还说，“我认为，如果情况能够像这样地获得发展，那么两国的邦交就能够得到调整。我认为，互相尊重，互相保有互不侵犯的信任感，这恐怕是今后互相应该集中力量进行协商的主要问题。”他说，“我今后愿意为实现上述几点而努力。”
    关于中国的经济建设，松村谦三说，虽然他在中国参观访问时采取有批判的态度，但是必须承认最近以来中国的经济建设有了巨大的发展。他说，作为一个了解旧中国的人，他看到中国人民大力从事建设而感到惊异。
    他谈到，他在中国曾参观了十五座工厂、十座水库、五个人民公社和二十六所学校和博物馆等设施。
    他说，中国工业相当发达。在文化方面，致力于保护古代文化。中国充满了生动活跃的气氛。
    松村说，“各地正在大规模地举办兴修水库和植树造林等事业。无论在那一方面，我们都很难轻视新中国的力量。”
    松村还说，“特别是他们的民族意识和对科学研究的热情，使我佩服。”他说：“由于中国国民的民族意识和对科学的热情，在工业设备、水库建设、教育和文化设备等方面获得了显著的发展。尤其是，似乎致力于人民公社的普及和铁路、发电站的建设等方面。通过这一切，深深感到中国已经成为一个出色的现代化国家。我认为，日本政府和国民应该正确地认识共产党中国的现实，以便采取在国际上和国内方面不落后于现实的对中国政策。”
    关于修改日美“安全条约”问题，他说因为离开日本五十天，不想就这个问题发表意见。但是，他说：日本外务相藤山爱一郎在国会会议上在答复日美“安全条约”的质询时，提出了美军向远东地区出动等问题，看来似乎给中国人民以很大的刺激。
    松村在2日晚上还在日本广播协会电台发表谈话，表示感谢中国方面对他的招待。他说：“我们特别深切地感到下面几点：看到中国正在出色的建设的路上，感到这对日中两国建立友好关系是值得高兴的，而且，还感到日中两国需要携起手来，为亚洲的繁荣和世界和平而努力。我们打算，把我们的见闻准确地传达给日本国民，为了更早地建立日中两国的友好关系而努力。”
    2日晚间，松村谦三和他的随行人员竹山裕太郎等还向记者高木健夫谈到了他们访问中国的感想。松村说：“中国的确变了样了。可以说是改变了面貌。我想可以说连人的表情都变了。”他说：“我们希望，由于我们这次的旅行，如果能够为两国建立友好关系，虽然不知道什么时候才能建立，能够播下种子，那就感到高兴。”
    竹山裕太郎也赞扬中国建设的高速度。
    随松村谦三访问中国的日本广播协会电台特派记者松井谈到他在这次访问期间，中国方面攻击岸信介内阁敌视中国的政策。他说，关于（岸信介政府）修改日美“安全条约”，他们那种严厉的程度是日本的人们所想像不到的。当他谈到中国经济发展的情况时他说，“五、六年后的中国是令人注目的”。他说：中国人民公社保证了农民的衣食，这是伟大的事情。
