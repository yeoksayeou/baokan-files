(Excerpts from Du Fengrui's family letters)

I.
Brother, it's not that I'm stopping you from coming to visit. Our family's life is difficult, and I can do everything in my power to help. I calculated that it would cost fifty yuan for you to come once. Wouldn't it be better to save this money to help the family? Besides, our parents are both seventy or eighty years old, who will take care of them if you leave home? Moreover, you are also a Communist Party member. When our hometown suffers a disaster, you must listen to the Party and work with the masses to overcome the difficulties.

Brother, no difficulty can frighten a Communist Party member. ... Among our pilots, there are many who, like me, are rough and simple people. They listen to the Party, use their brains, and find ways to overcome difficulties, and they have mastered highly scientific flight techniques... September 30, 1957

II.
After the great airing of views, big debates, and great-character posters, the ideological awareness of every comrade here has been raised, and their eyes have become clearer. ... A few people came from bourgeois families. Although they participated in the revolution and went through several political movements, they were always unwilling to change their position and unwilling to follow the Communist Party; there were also individuals who came from working-class families, performed meritorious service in the revolutionary army, and were rewarded, but they took their merits as personal capital, became arrogant, looked down on comrades, looked down on leaders, demanded promotions and better treatment, and became dissatisfied with the Party when they didn't get what they wanted. ... As a result, these people became bourgeois rightists. They are criminals against the people! Therefore, individualism is the source of all evils, and we should truly understand its harm ideologically.

Brother! You must listen carefully to the Party and follow the Party closely. You are a Communist Party member and a former revolutionary soldier who performed meritorious service in battle. Your ideological awareness must be higher than mine. I believe you can carry forward the glorious traditions of the revolutionary army in your hometown. April 28, 1958

III.
…The great leap forward of the vigorous socialist construction has begun. Of course, the People's Air Force is no exception. It is an army led by the Party, and it will become a powerful air force in the world at the greatest speed to defend our socialist construction.

Our country must catch up with or surpass Britain in steel production and other major industrial products within ten to fifteen years, then of course everyone must show revolutionary vigor. For the sake of the Great Leap Forward, I have decided not to go home to visit relatives this year. I believe our parents and you will agree.

Brother, I want to talk to you about the mistake you made this time: As a revolutionary soldier and a Communist Party member, he must earnestly understand and implement the Party's policies and resolutions. If he cannot grasp the policies, he will make mistakes. Safeguard the Party's unity, consolidate the Party's unification, strive to study Marxism-Leninism, improve his own level of awareness, and strictly abide by the Party Constitution and national laws and communist morality. Actively complete the tasks assigned to him by the Party. Put the interests of the Party, the country, and the people above personal interests, and resolutely obey the interests of the Party, the country, and the people when the two interests conflict. Serve the people wholeheartedly, maintain close ties with the people, learn from the people, humbly listen to and promptly reflect the people's demands and opinions to the Party, and explain the Party's policies and resolutions to them. Play an exemplary role in work, practice criticism and self-criticism. Be loyal and honest to the Party, and do not conceal or distort the truth. You understand these principles, but how well do you implement them? Of course, your mistake is also related to me. Indeed, I haven't helped you at all in peacetime, but it's mainly up to your own efforts. If you cannot achieve or implement the above-mentioned obligations of a party member, of course he is not up to the standards and conditions of a party member, he cannot be a communist party member, and then you will lose your political life. I believe you will return to the embrace of the Party. Don't lose confidence, and be able to withstand the test. Don't be afraid of difficulties, and dare to do work. Okay, I won't talk much. I hope you will write back soon. Goodbye!
May 11, 1958

IV.
Why don't you write to me? Maybe I criticized you too much in my previous letter and you have opinions about me; then why don't you bring it up to help each other? You must remember: we are brothers born of the same mother, and also revolutionary comrades...

Our work is relatively busy. In addition to flight training, we also participate in productive labor every day. We grow our own vegetables and eat them ourselves, and each person has to hand in fifty to one hundred catties of grain every year. The purpose of productive labor is not only to reduce the burden on the country, but also to transform our own thinking. July 8, 1958

V.
...Now people's communes are being organized everywhere. It is a big step forward compared to advanced agricultural cooperatives, and it is the bud of communism. Society is leaping forward, and if you are not careful to study, you will fall behind and make mistakes.

I hope you will study regularly and read more books on people's communes and agricultural programs.

Attached are some articles I clipped from the People's Daily, all about people's communes, for your reference when studying.

专栏：

    时刻想着党
    （杜凤瑞家书片断）
    一
    兄呀，我不是阻挡你前来探望。咱家的生活困难，我可以尽一切力量来帮助。我算了一下，你来一次，路费就得五十元，把这笔钱节省下来帮助家里，不是更好了吗？另外，咱父母亲都七、八十岁了，你离开了家谁来照顾他们？再说，兄也是一个共产党员，咱家乡闹灾，兄就要听党的话，同群众一起，来克服困难。
    兄呀，任何困难是吓不倒共产党员的。……在我们飞行员里，有许多人同我一样，都是大老粗，他们听党的话，动脑筋、想办法克服困难，就掌握了高度科学的飞行技术……。　1957年9月30日
    二
    经过大鸣大放大辩论，我们这里的每个同志，思想觉悟都提高了，眼睛也看得更清楚了。……有少数人出身于资产阶级家庭，参加革命后虽然经过数次政治运动，但是始终不愿意改变自己的立场，不愿意跟着共产党走；还有个别的人虽然出身于工人家庭，在革命部队中立过功，受过奖，但是他们拿功劳当做个人的资本，骄傲起来，看不起同志，看不起领导，闹级别、待遇，达不到目的就对党不满，……结果，这些人都成为资产阶级的右派分子。他们是对人民有罪的人！所以说，个人主义是万恶之源，应该真正从思想上去认识它的危害性。
    兄呀！你要好好地听党的话，紧紧地跟着党走。你是共产党员，过去也是一个革命军人，在战斗中也立过功，要比我思想觉悟高，相信你能够把革命军队的光荣传统在家乡发扬下去。　1958年4月28日
    三
    ……轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设大跃进开始了。当然人民空军也不例外，它是党所领导的军队，它会以最大的速度成为世界上的一支强大的空军，来保卫我们的社会主义建设。
    我们国家要在十至十五年内，在钢铁产量和其他主要工业产品产量方面赶上或超过英国，那当然人人得要拿出革命干劲来。为了大跃进，我决定今年不回家探亲了，我相信咱父母和你都会同意的。
    哥哥，我想给你谈谈关于你这次犯错误的事：做为一个革命军人、共产党员，他必须切实的了解和执行党的政策和决议，如果掌握不住政策他就会犯错误。维护党的团结，巩固党的统一，努力学习马列主义，提高自己的觉悟程度，严格地遵守党章和国家法律及共产主义道德。积极的完成党分配给自己的任务。把党的国家的也就是人民群众的利益，摆在个人的利益之上，在两个利益发生抵触的时候，坚决地服从党的、国家的和人民群众的利益。要全心全意为人民群众服务，密切联系人民群众，向人民群众学习，虚心地听取并及时地向党反映人民群众的要求和意见，向他们解释党的政策和决议。在工作中起模范作用，实行批评与自我批评。对党忠诚老实，不隐瞒和歪曲事实真相。这一些道理你是懂的，但你执行的怎么样呢？当然，你犯错误与我也有关系，的确平时我对你的帮助是一点也没有，但主要还是靠自己的努力，如果以上那些党员的义务，不能做到或执行，当然他不够党员的标准条件，他是不能做一个共产党员的，那你就会失掉政治生命。我相信你会重新回到党的怀抱，不要失掉信心，要经得起考验。一定不要怕困难，敢于做工作。好吧，别不多谈，望兄急速回信。再见！
                    1958年5月11日
    四
    你为什么不给我来信呢？可能我以前去信对你批评得过多，对我有意见；那为什么不给我提出来互相帮助呢？你要记着：咱们是一母所生的亲兄弟，又是革命同志……。
    我们的工作比较忙，除了飞行训练外，每天还参加劳动生产，菜自己种自己吃，粮食每年每人要交五十到一百斤。生产劳动的目的，既是为了减轻国家负担，也是为了改造自己的思想。　1958年7月8日
    五
    ……现在各地都组织人民公社，它比高级农业社又前进了一大步，是共产主义的萌芽。社会飞跃前进，要是一不注意学习就会落后，就会犯错误。
    我希望兄要经常学习，多看些有关人民公社和农业纲要等书籍。
    附上我从人民日报上剪下来的几篇文章，说的都是有关人民公社的问题，供兄学习时参考。
                    1958年8月29日
