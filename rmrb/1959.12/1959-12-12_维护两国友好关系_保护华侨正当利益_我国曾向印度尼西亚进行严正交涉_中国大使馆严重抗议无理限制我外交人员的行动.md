Xinhua News Agency, 11th – Since the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities were stirred up in Indonesia by some influential forces in May this year, the Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia have made several solemn representations to the Indonesian government in order to safeguard the friendly relations between China and Indonesia and protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. Foreign Minister Chen Yi and Ambassador Huang Zhen have repeatedly expressed the serious concern of the Chinese government to the Indonesian government and the Indonesian Ambassador to China, emphasizing that the two governments should value friendship and reasonably resolve the issue of overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia through consultation in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference. It was also pointed out that the two governments and peoples should be vigilant against the imperialist forces that sow discord and undermine the friendly relations between the two countries. However, the Chinese side's opinions have not been taken seriously by the relevant Indonesian authorities, and the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities have become increasingly serious. Therefore, on September 8, the Chinese government had no choice but to lodge a serious protest with the Indonesian government, requesting the Indonesian government to immediately take effective measures, proceeding from the maintenance of friendly relations between the two countries and respect for the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, to stop such anti-China and anti-Chinese activities that undermine the friendly relations between the two countries.

In October, Foreign Minister Chen Yi exchanged views with Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, who came to China for a visit, on the issue of overseas Chinese, and issued a joint communiqué of the two foreign ministers, putting forward the correct principles for handling the issue of overseas Chinese. However, after the issuance of the joint communiqué of the two foreign ministers, the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia not only did not ease, but intensified and expanded even further. In particular, forced relocation of overseas Chinese from areas below the county level has become widespread in West Java, and even bloody incidents of military police cruelly beating overseas Chinese have occurred frequently. At the same time, some Indonesian newspapers have also published a large number of anti-China and anti-Chinese remarks. The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia had to once again protest to the Indonesian government, demanding an immediate end to the forced relocation of overseas Chinese.

With the development of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, the normal activities of Chinese embassies and consulates in Indonesia have also been obstructed and restricted. On November 12, with the consent of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese Embassy sent Deputy Consul Wang Risheng to Cibadak, West Java, to investigate the incident of overseas Chinese being injured. However, Deputy Consul Wang Risheng's normal consular activities were repeatedly obstructed by military police personnel under the Third Military Region of Indonesia. On November 13, after Deputy Consul Wang arrived in Sukabumi, the local military authorities immediately dispatched armed military police to surround the hotel where he was staying, cut off his contact with the Consulate General, and ordered him to leave the area within five minutes and return to Jakarta. On November 18, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs even sent a note to the Chinese Embassy, prohibiting diplomatic officials below the ambassador and counselor of the embassy from leaving Jakarta. Then, on November 20, the military authorities of the Third Military Region issued instructions to the local wartime authorities under their jurisdiction, prohibiting all diplomatic personnel of the Chinese Embassy from entering the West Java region, and ordering Chinese diplomatic officials who were vacationing at the Chinese Embassy's villas in Cibalas and Cibaron to return to Jakarta within twenty-four hours.

At the same time, some Indonesian newspapers launched a smear campaign and attacks against the Chinese Embassy, and some newspapers even clamored for declaring Ambassador Huang Zhen as "persona non grata" and expelling Chinese diplomatic officials.

On the morning of November 17, Ambassador Huang Zhen visited Foreign Minister Subandrio, requesting the Indonesian government to immediately take measures to stop the anti-Chinese activities, stop the forced relocation of overseas Chinese, and stop the incitement of hostility and slander against China by certain newspapers. Afterwards, Foreign Minister Subandrio held a press conference. According to news reports, Foreign Minister Subandrio issued a statement completely contrary to the facts, saying that "Ambassador Huang Zhen has clearly stated his willingness to help implement the regulations on banning foreign small vendors in rural areas and the order to relocate foreigners from areas below the county level in West Java for safety reasons." Some local military police personnel then widely publicized this untrue statement in various places, attempting to further incite anti-Chinese activities and provoke dissatisfaction among overseas Chinese towards the Chinese Embassy. In order to clarify the facts, the Chinese Embassy issued a communiqué on the details of the meeting between Ambassador Huang Zhen and Foreign Minister Subandrio on the evening of November 17.

Regarding the Indonesian government and the military authorities of the Third Military Region violating international practices and taking discriminatory restrictions against diplomatic officials of the Chinese Embassy and depriving Chinese consuls of their normal rights to perform their duties, the Chinese Embassy has lodged a serious protest with the Indonesian government, demanding the revocation of this unreasonable regulation.

    维护两国友好关系  保护华侨正当利益
    我国曾向印度尼西亚进行严正交涉
    中国大使馆严重抗议无理限制我外交人员的行动
    新华社11日讯　自从今年5月在印度尼西亚被一些有影响的势力煽起反华和排华活动以来，中国政府和中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆，为了维护中国和印度尼西亚友好关系和保护华侨正当权利和利益，曾经多次向印度尼西亚政府进行了严正的交涉。陈毅外交部长和黄镇大使曾经多次向印度尼西亚政府和印度尼西亚驻华大使表示了中国政府的严重关切，强调两国政府应以友好为重，根据和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议十项原则，通过协商合理解决定居在印度尼西亚的华侨问题，并且指出，两国政府和人民应该警惕帝国主义势力挑拨和破坏两国的友好关系。但是，中国方面的意见并未引起印度尼西亚有关当局的重视，反华和排华活动却日益严重。因此，中国政府于9月8日不得不向印度尼西亚政府提出了严重抗议的照会，要求印度尼西亚政府从维护两国友好关系和尊重华侨正当权利和利益出发，立即采取有效措施，制止这种破坏两国友好的反华和排华活动。
    10月间，陈毅外交部长同前来中国访问的印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约就华侨问题交换了意见，并且发表了两国外长联合公报，提出了处理华侨问题的正确原则。但是，在两国外长联合公报发表后，在印度尼西亚的排华活动不但未见缓和，反而变本加厉，更加扩大。特别是西爪哇普遍发生了武力逼迫华侨迁出县以下地区的行动，甚至不断发生军警残酷殴打华侨的流血事件。同时，印度尼西亚的一部分报纸也大量发表了反华和排华的言论。中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆不得不再次向印度尼西亚政府提出抗议，要求立即停止对华侨的逼迁行动。
    随着反华和排华活动的发展，中国驻印度尼西亚的大使馆和领事馆的正常活动，也受到了阻挠和限制。11月12日，中国大使馆在征得印度尼西亚外交部同意以后，派遣了王日升副领事到西爪哇芝巴德调查打伤华侨的事件。但是，王日升副领事的正常领事活动却遭到印度尼西亚第三军区属下军警人员的百般阻挠。11月13日，王副领事到达苏甲巫眉后，当地军事当局即派遣武装军警包围了他所住的旅馆，断绝了他与总领事馆的联系，限令他在五分钟内离开该地，返回雅加达。11月18日，印度尼西亚外交部竟照会中国大使馆，禁止大使馆大使和参赞以下外交官员离开雅加达。接着，11月20日，第三军区军事当局向所属地方战时掌权者发布训令，不准许中国大使馆所有外交人员进入西爪哇地区，并且限令正在芝巴拉斯和芝巴荣的中国大使馆别墅度假的中国外交官员于二十四小时内返回雅加达。
    与此同时，印度尼西亚一部分报纸发动了对中国大使馆的污蔑和攻击，有的报纸甚至叫嚣要求宣布黄镇大使为“不受欢迎的人”和驱逐中国外交官员。
    11月17日上午，黄镇大使访问了外交部长苏班德里约，要求印度尼西亚政府立即采取措施，制止排华行动，停止对华侨的逼迁行为，制止某些报纸敌视和诬蔑中国的煽动。事后，苏班德里约外长举行了记者招待会，据新闻报道，苏班德里约外长发表了与事实完全相反的声明，说“黄镇大使已经明确表示愿意帮助执行取缔乡村外侨小商贩的条例和为了安全起见让西爪哇地区县以下地方的外侨迁移的命令”。一些地方军警人员随即将此项不符合事实的声明在各地大肆宣传，企图进一步煽动排华活动和挑起华侨对中国大使馆的不满。中国大使馆为了澄清事实真相，于11月17日晚发表了黄镇大使同苏班德里约外长会谈经过情形的公报。
    对于印度尼西亚政府和第三军区军事当局违反国际惯例，对中国大使馆外交官员采取歧视性限制和剥夺中国领事行使职务的正常权利的行为，中国大使馆已经向印度尼西亚政府提出了严重抗议，要求撤销此项无理规定。
