　　The Dialectical Nature of the Standard of Practice
　　Mo·Rutkevich
    Practice, as people's material activity, precedes consciousness, as people's spiritual activity, in two basic aspects: practice is the source and foundation of acquired knowledge, and at the same time the measure and standard of this knowledge. However, the understanding caused by practice is by no means a passive product of practice, and it has a great counter-effect on the use of knowledge in practice. Generally speaking, the more accurately our consciousness reflects reality and the more widely knowledge is utilized by the masses, the greater the influence of our consciousness on practice.
    Regarding the dialectical issue of using practice to test knowledge, we will study it from three points: the interrelationship between previous practice and subsequent practice, and the dialectical interrelationship between the basis of knowledge and the standard of knowledge; the interrelationship between logical proof and practical testing; and the interrelationship between relative factors and absolute factors in the standard of practice.
    I. As soon as we raise the following question, we can immediately see the necessity of a dialectical understanding of practice as the standard of truth. The question is: Do theoretical conclusions have a certain degree of authenticity before they are directly confirmed by practice? Idealism uses the predictive power of science to speculate, claiming that truth can be obtained without practical testing. The real reason for this idealistic conclusion is a metaphysical view of practical testing. Indeed, if the practical test is always understood as merely an action following the theoretical proposal, then one cannot understand how the theory could contain truth before this test action.
    The test of theory by practice is carried out throughout the entire process of practical activities, and it should be especially noted that this process includes not only subsequent practice but also previous practice. Previous practice is first and foremost the foundation and source of the proposed theoretical principle, and at the same time the basic standard of this principle. When Mendeleev created the periodic law, didn't he start from the experimental practice of discovering the same characteristics of different elements that had already been discovered before him? Didn't he always resort to practice as the basis of knowledge, and didn't he use existing experimental materials to test every step of his reasoning? Not only Mendeleev did this, but any scientist who wants to base his theory on experience rather than indulging in fantasy must do so.
    This is not at all to deny the decisive significance of subsequent practical testing. Subsequent practice not only confirms scientific conclusions (if this conclusion is based on previous practice) but also makes this conclusion more precise and further. For example, the practical test of Mendeleev's prediction of undiscovered elements not only confirmed the periodic law but also made it more accurate in many ways.
    The truth about the possibility of a revolution first winning victory in one country, which Lenin said as early as before the October Revolution, is also true in principle. Lenin based his arguments on the practice of the world revolutionary movement of the proletariat and the oppressed colonial nations in the era of imperialism, especially the experience accumulated during the First World War. Lenin's conclusion that it was possible to break through the imperialist front first in one or several countries, thereby having a period of coexistence of two systems, socialist and capitalist, was entirely based on practice, because in social life itself, in practice, there were already all the factors that could lead to this conclusion. When making this remarkable theoretical prediction, which played a huge role in all subsequent practical activities of the Party, Lenin used the existing facts, the entire previous practice of the mass anti-imperialist revolutionary movement, to test every step of his reasoning about the future development of world events. The October Revolution confirmed Lenin's basic conclusion in life.
    In short, the test of theory by practice is a process that is largely realized in the process of creating the theory, because in the process of creating the theory, every step of the theorist's reasoning is tested and confirmed by previous practice. When Lenin talked about Marx's "Capital," he said: "Here, in every step of the analysis, it is tested by facts, that is, by practice."
    II. Now let's talk about the dialectical interrelationship between logical proof and practical testing.
    Scientific conclusions are judgments in their logical form. If practice has long proved the correctness of some of our judgments, and we logically derive a new judgment from these judgments, and consider this judgment to be true before a special practical test action, then this raises a question: Can logical proof replace (completely or partially) practical proof, practical testing?
    If our premises are proven by practice and are therefore correct, and if our reasoning is correct, without violating logical rules or mathematical calculation errors, then we can draw conclusions that conform to the actual situation from these premises. Many enemies of Marxism use this undoubted fact to argue that there are two standards of truth—logical standard and practical standard.
    This view is wrong and fundamentally contradicts Marxism. The essence of the problem is that correct reasoning (including correct mathematical calculations) is certainly a necessary condition for reaching the truth, but this condition is not sufficient. The logical correctness of reasoning is certainly necessary, but it alone cannot guarantee the authenticity of the conclusion, because the facts and premises on which we rely must be proven by practice. Only in this case can we draw true conclusions through correct logical reasoning.
    The logical standard itself is ultimately a practical standard, so there is only one standard of truth—human practice, but human practice not only directly proves the truth, but also proves the truth in an extremely indirect way, that is, by testing the authenticity of the laws of thinking.
    There are many principles that have either not been directly proven by practice or cannot be directly proven at all, and we are deeply convinced of the authenticity of these principles precisely because the laws of thinking by which we reason have been tested by practice.
    Materialist philosophy and modern natural science put forward a thesis that living things on earth originate from non-living things. When we prove the authenticity of the proposed judgment, we rely on facts that have been proven by practice, and draw logical conclusions from these facts. We use judgments proven by practice to make such reasoning: since matter in general has the ability to develop forward, and there was no life on earth in the initial stage and life could not be brought to earth from the outside, then it is obvious that living things are produced from non-living things in the process of earth development. Although practice has not directly proven this thesis here, we have no reason to doubt the authenticity of this thesis.
    The situation in social science is also the same. In his report to the 21st Congress of the CPSU, N. Khrushchev put forward an extremely important theoretical principle, believing that socialism in our country has not only achieved a complete victory, but also achieved a thorough victory. N. Khrushchev said at the Congress: "The Soviet state and any other socialist country cannot be insured from possible aggression by imperialist countries." However, unlike the situation before the Second World War, the balance of world power has undergone fundamental changes. Today's practice has proven the authenticity of this judgment: "The current balance of actual power in the world is such that we can defeat any aggression by any enemy" (N. Khrushchev).
    However, the principle of the thorough victory of socialism is not only suitable for the present, but also for the future. Therefore, it is necessary to start not only from the current balance of power, but also to estimate the trend of power changes. This trend is such that the balance of power is constantly changing and will further change in an increasingly favorable direction for socialism.
    There are many such assertions in science that cannot be directly proven at all. For example, the principle of the infinity of space cannot be directly proven in practice, because no matter how great our progress in studying the infinite universe, there will always be the possibility of continuing progress. It is impossible to prove the principle of the infinity of space by direct experiments and observations. The authenticity of this type of judgment can be indirectly proven by practice, and here the correct conclusions drawn from the correct premises play a decisive role.
    In short, the dialectical nature of the standard of practice lies in the fact that in this standard, practical testing and logical proof are directly intertwined and interact with each other. Logical proof takes an indirect form, and through the proof of the authenticity of logical laws by practice, it is ultimately a link in practical testing.
    III. The dialectical nature of the standard of practice is most clearly manifested in the interrelationship between the absolute factors and relative factors of the standard of practice. This extremely important epistemological problem was raised by Lenin in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." In solving this problem, Lenin based his arguments on the Marxist principle of the interrelationship between absolute truth and relative truth, which he further developed. Absolute truth is an absolutely accurate and completely correct reflection of the object in human consciousness; relative truth is a relatively accurate and approximately correct reflection of the object. In relative truth there are always components, factors, and particles of absolute truth. On the other hand, absolute truth is composed of relative truth.
    The relativity and incompleteness of the standard of practice are first manifested in the fact that individual isolated practical actions are not enough to prove the truth or falsehood of the entire theory. Indeed, one experiment can generally be interpreted in various different theoretical ways, each of which can be partially confirmed by this experiment, and is therefore a relative truth. In addition, one type of experiment can confirm one theory, while another type of experiment on the same object can confirm another theory. This continues until a theory is created that synthesizes local ideas and can therefore explain this type or that type of experiment, that is, it is confirmed in all experimental materials.
    A practical action, for example, the success of a certain strike, can be said to be a confirmation of the Marxist theory that the struggle to improve the conditions of selling labor is a necessary part of the proletariat's class struggle, but this part is subject to the main purpose—the political struggle to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. The victorious economic strike proves the growth of the working class's solidarity, thereby confirming the Marxist principle: "The working class can temporarily improve its situation in the struggle against the bourgeoisie, but in order to gain economic liberation, it must seize power." However, the success of a certain strike (and the general economic struggle) is often interpreted by reformists as a confirmation of the opportunist theory and the following judgment (this judgment is part of the whole of the opportunist theory): "The working class can continuously improve its situation under capitalist conditions and move towards socialism on this road." What confirms the correctness of Marxism and refutes reformism is not individual successful or unsuccessful strikes, but the entire process of the proletariat's economic and political struggle, the entire process of capitalist development, which proves that relative impoverishment and absolute impoverishment are the laws of capitalism, so for the proletariat, the only way to get rid of capitalist slavery is to establish its own dictatorship.
    The relativity of the standard of practice cannot be reduced to proving the relative authenticity of the theory with local experience. If we should dialectically examine practice as the standard of truth, that is, treat practice as a complete unity and process, then we should also not regard the theory to be tested in practice as a mechanical combination of individual judgments (each of which must be tested separately in practice). Practice can prove the authenticity of local judgments, but these local judgments themselves can be included in various extremely different and sometimes opposing theories.
    In the interrelationship between the absolute factors and relative factors of truth and the issue of the standard of truth, relativism and dogmatism contradict dialectical materialism.
    One of the characteristics of relativism is to exaggerate the relative factors in truth, because relativism believes that there is nothing general in individual practical actions, so the truth proven by individual practical actions is only true under certain specific conditions of experience.
    Epistemological relativism was and still is the theoretical basis of revisionism. Revisionists absolutize the special characteristics under national conditions, thereby negating the general laws in the historical experience of the people of all countries. For example, Yugoslav and other revisionists deny the undoubted fact that the revolutionary struggle experience of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people of all ethnic groups under its leadership, which first built socialism in the world, contains certain characteristics common to the people of all countries, and these characteristics are precisely the basic part of the Soviet experience.
    Contrary to relativism, the epistemology of dialectical materialism asserts that there must be something general in individual things. Lenin pointed out that not only theory has universality, but practice also has universality: "Practice is higher than (theoretical) knowledge, because practice not only has the advantage of universality, but also has the advantage of direct reality." Taking the practice of social struggle as an example, this means that the mass experience gained in a certain period of capitalist development or a certain stage of socialist construction in this or that country must contain certain basic factors common to all stages of development and all countries of the system. Practice directly manifests itself as the standard of truth for concrete ideas about the historical process of a country under certain conditions, and at the same time it proves the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism in one way or another.

　　实践标准的辩证性质
　　莫·鲁特凯维奇
    作为人们物质活动的实践对于作为人们精神活动的意识的第一性，表现在两个基本方面：实践是所获得的知识的源泉、基础，同时又是这些知识的尺度、标准。但是，由实践引起的认识，决不是实践的消极产物，它对于在实践中利用知识起着很大的反作用。一般说来，我们的意识越是确切地反映现实，知识越是广泛地被群众所利用，那么我们的意识对实践的影响就越大。
    关于用实践来检验知识这一辩证法问题，我们分三点来研究：以前的实践和以后的实践的相互关系以及认识基础和认识标准的辩证的相互联系；逻辑证明和实践检验的相互关系；实践标准中相对因素和绝对因素的相互关系。
    一、只要我们一提出下面这个问题，就立即可以看出对作为真理标准的实践作辩证的理解的必要性，这个问题就是：理论的结论，在它们直接被实践所证实以前，是否具有一定程度的真实性？唯心主义利用科学的预见能力进行投机，宣称没有实践的检验也可以得到真理。这个唯心主义结论的真正原因是形而上学地看待实践的检验。的确，如果把实践的检验总是理解为仅仅是跟随理论提出之后的一次行动，那么就不能了解在这次检验行动之前理论中怎么能够包含真理。
    实践对于理论的检验是在实践活动的整个过程中进行的，并且特别要注意的是，这个过程不仅包括以后的实践，而且包括以前的实践。以前的实践首先是并且当然是所提出的理论原理的基础、源泉，同时又是这种原理的基本标准。当门得列也夫创立周期律的时候，难道他没有从那些在他之前就已发现了不同元素具有相同特性的实验的实践出发？难道他没有随时求助于作为认识基础的实践，难道他没有用已有的实验材料来检验自己的每一步推论？不仅门得列也夫是这样做了的，任何一个科学家，只要他想把自己的理论建立在经验的基础上，而不是耽于幻想，那他也要这样做。
    这完全不是否定以后的实践检验的决定性意义。以后的实践不仅证实科学的结论（如果这个结论是以以前的实践为基础的话），而且使这一结论能够更加确切和更进一步。例如，对于门得列也夫关于还未发现的元素的预言的实践检验，不仅证实了周期律，而且在很多方面使周期律更加确切了。
    列宁早在十月革命之前说出的关于革命可能首先在一个国家取得胜利的真理，在原则上也是如此。列宁所依据的是帝国主义时代无产阶级和殖民地被压迫民族的世界革命运动的实践，特别是在第一次世界大战年代所积累起来的经验。列宁关于可能首先在一个国家或几个国家冲破帝国主义战线、从而将有一个社会主义和资本主义两种体系共处的时期的结论，完全是以实践为依据的，因为在社会生活本身中，在实践中，已经有了可以作出这个结论的一切因素。在作出这个卓越的、对于党的以后全部实践活动起了巨大作用的理论预测的时候，列宁曾经用已有的事实，用群众反帝革命运动的全部以前的实践来检验过他关于世界事件将来发展情形的每一步推论。十月革命在生活中证实了列宁的这个基本结论。
    总之，实践对于理论的检验是一个过程，这个过程大部分在创立理论的过程中就已实现，因为在创立理论的过程中，理论家的每一步推论都被以前的实践所检验和证实。列宁谈到马克思的“资本论”时说道：“在这里，在每一步分析中，都用事实即用实践来进行检验。”
    二、现在我们来谈谈逻辑证明和实践检验的辩证的相互联系问题。
    科学结论就其逻辑形式说是判断。如果实践早就证明了我们的某些判断的正确性，而我们又从这些判断中合乎逻辑地引伸出一个新的判断，并且在专门的实践检验行动之前就认为这个判断是真实的，那么这就提出一个问题：逻辑证明能不能代替（完全地或部分地）实践的证明、实践的检验呢？
    如果我们的前提为实践所证明，因而是正确的，如果我们的推论正确，没有违反逻辑规则和没有数学计算的错误，那么我们就可以从这些前提中得出符合实际情况的结论。马克思主义的许多敌人利用这个无疑的事实，认为存在着两个真理标准——逻辑的标准和实践的标准。
    这种看法是错误的，这种看法根本与马克思主义相抵触。问题的实质在于，正确的推论（包括正确的数学演算在内）当然是达到真理的必要条件，但这个条件不是充足的。推论的逻辑正确性当然是需要的，但是它本身还不能保证结论的真实性，因为必须使我们所依据的那些事实和前提为实践所证明。只有在这种情况下，我们才能通过正确的逻辑推论得出真实的结论。
    逻辑的标准本身归根到底也是实践的标准，所以只存在一个真理标准——人类实践，但是人类实践不仅是直接地证明真理，而且也用极其间接的方式即通过检验思维规律的真实性来证明真理。
    有许多原理或者是还没有直接被实践所证明，或者是根本不能直接证明，而我们之所以深信这些原理的真实性，恰恰是因为我们借以进行推论的思维规律已经为实践所检验。
    唯物主义哲学和现代自然科学提出一个论断，认为地球上有生命的东西产生于无生命的东西。当我们证明所提出的这个判断的真实性的时候，我们是依据为实践所证实的事实，并从这些事实中作出合乎逻辑的结论。我们依据实践所证明的判断来进行这样的推论：既然物质一般有前进发展的能力，而地球上在最初阶段也没有生命并且生命也不可能从外面带到地球上来，那么很明显，有生命的东西是在地球发展过程中从无生命的东西产生的。虽然实践在这里还没有直接地证明这一论断，但是我们没有理由怀疑这个论断的真实性。
    社会科学方面的情形也是如此。尼·赫鲁晓夫在苏共第二十一次代表大会上的报告中提出了一个极重要的理论原理，认为社会主义在我国不仅取得了完全的胜利，而且取得了彻底的胜利。尼·赫鲁晓夫在代表大会上说道：“苏维埃国家以及任何其他社会主义国家不能保险不受到帝国主义国家可能的侵略”。但是，和第二次世界大战以前的情况不同，现在世界力量的对比已发生根本变化。今天的实践已经证明了这一判断的真实性：“现在世界实际力量的对比是这样的：我们能够击败任何敌人的任何侵犯”（尼·赫鲁晓夫语）。
    但是，关于社会主义彻底胜利的原理不仅适合于现在，而且也适合于将来。因此，不仅要从现在的力量对比出发，而且还要估计到力量的变化的趋势。这种趋势是这样的：力量对比正在不断变化，并且将朝着越来越有利于社会主义的方面进一步变化。
    在科学中有不少这样的论断，它们根本不可能直接得到证明。例如，关于空间无限性的原理就不可能在实践中直接被证明，因为不管我们在研究无限宇宙空间方面有多么大的进展，总会有继续进展的可能性。用直接的实验和观察来证明空间无限性的原理是不可能的。这类判断的真实性可以由实践间接证明，在这里从正确前提中得出的正确结论起着决定作用。
    总之，实践标准的辩证性质在于：在这个标准中实践检验和逻辑证明直接地互相交错和互相作用。逻辑证明采取间接形式，通过实践对逻辑规律真实性的证明，归根到底也是实践检验的一个环节。
    三、实践标准的辩证性质最明显地表现在实践标准的绝对因素和相对因素的相互关系中。这个极重要的认识论问题是列宁在“唯物主义和经验批判主义”中提出的。在解决这个问题方面，列宁所依据的是被他进一步发展了的马克思主义关于绝对真理和相对真理的相互关系的原理。绝对真理是客体在人的意识中绝对确切的、完全正确的反映；相对真理是客体的相对确切的、近似正确的反映。在相对真理中总是有绝对真理的成分、因素、颗粒。另一方面，绝对真理是由相对真理构成的。
    实践标准的相对性、不完备首先表现在：个别的孤立的实践行动不足以证明整个理论的真假。的确，一次实验，一般说来可以作各种不同的理论解释，其中每一种解释都可以局部地为这种实验所证实，因而是相对真理。此外，一类实验可以证实一种理论，而另一类对于同一对象的实验则可以证实另一种理论。这样继续下去，一直到创立这样一种理论：它把局部的观念综合起来，因而它能够解释这类或那类实验，即在全部经验材料中得到证实。
    一次实践行动，例如，某一次罢工的成功，可以说是对于马克思主义的这一理论的证实：这一理论认为改善出卖劳动力的条件的斗争是无产阶级的阶级斗争的必要环节，但这个环节服从于主要的目的——建立无产阶级专政的政治斗争。胜利的经济罢工证明工人阶级团结性的增长，从而证实马克思主义的这一原理：“工人阶级在同资产阶级的斗争中能够暂时地改善自己的状况，但是为了在经济上获得解放，它必须夺取政权”。但是，某一次罢工（和一般的经济斗争）的成功经常被改良主义者解释为对于机会主义理论和下面这一判断（这个判断是机会主义理论这个整体的一部分）的证实：“工人阶级可以在资本主义条件下不断改善自己的状况并且在这条道路上走向社会主义”。证实马克思主义正确和驳倒改良主义的，不是个别成功的或不成功的罢工，而是无产阶级的经济斗争和政治斗争的整个进程，资本主义国家发展的整个进程，这个进程证明，相对贫困化和绝对贫困化是资本主义的规律，因而对于无产阶级来说，摆脱资本主义奴隶制的唯一出路是建立自己的专政。
    实践标准的相对性不能归结为用局部经验来证明理论的相对真实性。如果说我们应当辩证地考察作为真理标准的实践，即把实践当作一个完整的统一体和过程来加以考察，那么也就应当不是把要在实践中加以检验的理论看作个别判断（其中每个判断都要在实践中分别得到检验）的机械结合。实践可以证明局部判断的真实性，但是这种局部判断本身可以包括到各种极其不同的、有时是对立的理论中去。
    在真理的绝对因素和相对因素的相互关系以及真理的标准问题上，相对主义和教条主义同辩证唯物主义相抵触。
    相对主义的一个特点是夸大真理中的相对因素，这是由于相对主义认为在个别实践行动中没有一般的东西，因而个别实践行动所证明的真理仅仅在某种经验的具体条件下才是真理。
    认识论上的相对主义过去是，现在仍然是修正主义的理论基础。修正主义者把民族条件下的特殊特征绝对化，从而否定各国人民历史经验中的一般规律性。例如，南斯拉夫的和其他的修正主义者否定这一无可怀疑的事实，即在苏联共产党和它所领导的、首先在世界上建成了社会主义的苏联各族人民的革命斗争经验中，包含着某些为各国人民共同的特征，而这些特征正是苏联经验的基本部分。
    与相对主义相反，辩证唯物主义的认识论断定，在个别东西中必然包含着一般东西。列宁指出，不仅理论具有普遍性，而且实践也具有普遍性：“实践高于（理论的）认识，因为实践不仅有普遍性的优点，并且有直接的现实性的优点。”拿社会斗争实践来说，这就是说，在这个或那个国家里资本主义发展某一时期或社会主义建设某一阶段所获得的群众经验中，必定包含有该制度一切发展阶段和一切国家共同的某些基本因素。实践直接表现为关于某种条件下某一国家历史进程的具体观念的真理标准，同时它又这样或那样地证明马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。
