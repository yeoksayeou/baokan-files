    New Atmosphere on the Cultural Front
    ——Since the Czechoslovak Socialist Cultural Congress
    By our correspondent Yang Yi
    A Loud Bugle Call
    In June of this year, just as the beautiful early summer season was upon Prague, a loud bugle call of socialist cultural revolution was sounded in the Palace of Congresses in the famous Julius Fučík Park. It was jointly sounded by the more than two thousand representatives attending the Czechoslovak Socialist Cultural Congress. It victoriously realized the mobilization for socialist revolution in the ideological realm, and clearly demonstrated the common will of Czechoslovak cultural workers to fight bravely alongside the workers and peasants, under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    The convening of the Socialist Cultural Congress was a victorious summary of the cultural work guidelines and policies of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (CCP) over the past three years. People living in Prague can clearly recall that in the summer of 1956, due to the impact of international bourgeois and revisionist trends of thought, a small countercurrent also emerged in the Czechoslovak cultural circles. They negated the achievements of Czechoslovak socialist culture since liberation, proclaimed themselves as the so-called "national conscience," opposed the ideological nature of art, and advocated that art should not serve politics. Beginning with the Second Congress of the Czechoslovak Writers' Union held in 1956, the CCP patiently persuaded and educated these erroneous tendencies, and also launched sharp criticism and struggle, thereby achieving the goal of winning over and uniting these few cultural workers who had gone astray and returning them to the banner of socialism. This new unity made it possible for Czechoslovakia to take the Socialist Cultural Congress as a starting point in a new historical stage, to further mobilize, organize, and educate the broad masses of the people, especially the cultural circles, to jointly complete the sacred mission of the socialist cultural revolution. The congress proceeded in this way. Participating in the congress were not only well-known figures in the cultural circles, but also thousands of cultural workers from factories, rural areas, and the armed forces, as well as grassroots Party organization workers. They jointly explored the issue of realizing socialist revolution in people's thinking and spiritual life, studied the ways of rural mass cultural work, and the principles of combining education with production and labor. In the field of literature and art, the slogan "Let culture approach life, let cultural workers approach the people" and the call "Create works with modern life as the theme" received widespread support and response.
    Go to the Masses, Go to Life
    Going deep into life and approaching the masses is the source of vigorous creative inspiration for writers and artists. Czechoslovak cultural workers have realized this from past lessons, and thus have generated an increasingly strong demand to "go to the masses, go to life." The CCP and various artists' associations also strongly support and assist writers and artists in this conscious action. In the past six months, not only has the traditional friendship between artists and working people been strengthened, but also many new ties have been established.
    One of the sensational events in the second half of this year was the first visit and performance in more than a decade between the prestigious Czech National Theatre and the Slovak National Theatre. In particular, the Czech National Theatre, which was awarded the highest national medal – the Order of the Republic – spent more than a month traveling all over the country, going deep into factories, rural areas, and the armed forces, and giving many performances for urban and rural working people and People's Army soldiers. This tour strengthened the flesh-and-blood ties between theater workers and working people. After each performance, directors and actors would sit down with the audience to listen to their opinions and requests. In summarizing the gains of this tour, many actors said that only in contact with the broad masses can one truly appreciate the importance of art serving the working people.
    The Komorni Theatre in Prague has established close ties with the ČKD Dukla Engineering Factory. They often invite workers to watch rehearsals and ask them to offer their opinions. Actors also frequently provide playwrights with meaningful themes discovered during their interactions with workers as clues for their creations.
    The "Poetry Day" recently held in Litoměřice County, Ústí Region, was also an activity to strengthen the connection between artists and working people. Poets held poetry reading evenings for the masses there, conducted discussions with them, and visited local villages and towns. This form obviously helps to enhance the influence of poetry on working people and greatly enriches the source of poets' creations.
    In addition to artists in the fields of drama, music, poetry, and fine arts frequently going to factories and rural areas to experience life and mingling with the working people through discussions and other forms, Czechoslovak writers also often visit various places, holding various forums with workers and peasants, familiarizing themselves with the lives of their readers, and discovering themes related to real life. Many writers have their own "bases" that they visit from time to time, or regularly live, labor, and work there. In the past six months, many writers and editors of literary newspapers have gone to small and medium-sized cities, factories, and rural areas, preparing to settle there for a longer period of time. Some went to work as tractor drivers and cooperative members, and some went to do cultural propaganda work. Now, the Party and the Writers' Union are mobilizing and organizing more writers to go to the countryside and factories, to go deep into life and the masses, and to launch a high tide of socialist realism creation.
    The Beginning of a Period of Rising Creation
    Culture can take root in life and bear fruit. Professor Štoll, a famous Czechoslovak literary theorist and president of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee’s Academy of Social Sciences, recently affirmed in response to reporters' inquiries that since the Socialist Cultural Congress, Czechoslovakia has seen a period of rising creation. A batch of new good works with the theme of socialist revolution and construction has emerged in the fields of novels, poetry, features, dramas, and films. Writer Malek has written some short stories reflecting industrial construction and the lives of miners after going to the coal and steel center of Ostrava to experience life. Writer Štehlik's novel with the theme of rural life is the crystallization of his life in the countryside. Poet Hrubín also created the long poem "Green Branches and Leaves" after approaching and discussing with the masses. The works of writers Milač, Heczko, and Zitrezovsky show a true and correct description of modern life. They praise the new qualities of people after liberation, expose the remnants of bourgeois individualism, and portray the transformation of old intellectuals.
    There have also been some new attempts in drama. Playwright Čach's play "Grandma" reflects the problems in current agricultural production cooperatives, and Danek's new work "Face Up" also touches on new themes, depicting the story of a strong revolutionary and his daughter. In the new drama year, theaters everywhere presented a large number of repertoires with the theme of modern life. A quarter of the repertoires are about today’s life in plays alone. Even the Czech National Theatre, which has always mainly staged classical dramas, also performed three modern plays this year, one of which is young writer Topol's play "Their Lives," which describes youth issues. In order to promote more performances of repertoires reflecting modern life in various genres, the Czechoslovak drama circles also organized performances and discussions of modern plays, operas, ballets, and puppet shows in the second half of this year.
    Film is the art project that touches the most on modern themes. The Slovak film "Lieutenant Daubac," which was released in the second half of this year, reflects the heroic deeds of the Slovak National Uprising and has been well received by audiences. Films depicting the construction of the Kladno Steel Rolling Mill, the scene of the Ostrava industrial base, and the development of the early Czechoslovak workers' movement are also being filmed.
    Since the convening of the Socialist Cultural Congress was only six months ago, and artistic creation often takes a long time, many excellent works are still in the process of creation. Many writers and artists are engaged in a creative competition to welcome the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia next year. Therefore, the results of the congress will be more fully and convincingly displayed when these works are published.
    Mass Cultural Education
    Rural mass cultural education is one of the focuses of attention of the Socialist Cultural Congress. It is an important aspect of implementing the slogan of "making culture more lively and making life more cultural." In order to adjust the weak links in the socialist cultural revolution, the CCP is now vigorously strengthening the cultural life of small and medium-sized towns and rural areas. The leadership of the cultural activities of the working people will also be transferred to the Party committees at all levels, especially the county Party committees, with the upcoming reorganization of national administrative divisions. Each administrative region will establish daily newspapers, publishing houses, film studios, and various artists' organizations, so that writers and artists can be more closely connected to life. Each county will open "People's Art Schools" including various disciplines. Cultural palaces or clubs should be generally established in various rural areas and small towns, and cultural cadres should be cultivated in large numbers and mass cultural and entertainment activities should be carried out through various channels. Various artists' associations have also decided to face the masses, and organize various mobile art exhibitions, tours, and educational concerts in small and medium-sized towns, factories, and rural areas. The training of young writers and artists is also one of the central tasks of the CCP's current cultural work. According to Professor Štoll's statement to reporters, the purpose of all this is to make the broad masses of working people active members of the socialist cultural revolution and make them, like artists, creators of socialist culture.
    The new guidelines for Czechoslovak education are also being implemented in the second half of this year. From the new school year, primary and secondary schools have begun teaching reforms that closely integrate education with production and life. According to specific conditions, the length of schooling has been extended, production internship courses have been opened, and various voluntary labor activities have been organized to cultivate new-type intellectuals who have both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Scientific workers have also resolutely implemented the principle of scientific research serving socialist production and construction. Many scientists have gone to enterprises and agricultural cooperatives, or established close ties with production units, to help them solve new problems in their work.
     Advance under the Leadership of the Party
    Professor Štoll said that since the Socialist Cultural Congress, writers have more deeply appreciated the leading role of the Party. The CCP mainly conducts ideological leadership in the cultural circles, using methods such as education, persuasion, and criticism. Each artists' association has a Party group. Members of the Party group persuade and educate their partners through talks, forums, discussions, and publishing articles. At the same time, Party member writers and artists also use their creations that truly reflect reality and have artistic power as examples for non-Party colleagues and as a clear proof of the correctness of the Party's cultural policies.
    Enhancing Marxist-Leninist literary criticism and developing Marxist-Leninist aesthetic theory is also one of the ways for the CCP to strengthen its leadership over literary and artistic work. Now the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and universities are paying attention to training literary and artistic theory cadres. The CCP Central Committee’s Academy of Social Sciences is also exploring the evaluation of literature in the fifteen years since liberation and the criticism of various schools of thought in Czechoslovakia in the 1920s and 1930s. In order to assist Party organizations at all levels in leading and carrying out cultural work, the CCP has decided to retain the organizational form of the central and local preparatory committees composed of representatives of cultural workers and other people from all walks of life before the convening of the Socialist Cultural Congress. Its task is to unify the efforts of various artists' associations, summarize the experience of cultural work in this country and other socialist countries, and apply them in specific conditions in this country.
    The task put forward by Czechoslovakia is to complete socialist construction in the 1960s. This grand prospect excites the hearts of every cultural worker. Under the correct guidance of the Party, the struggle against various bourgeois ideologies and the realization of socialist transformation in the ideological field are constantly taking place in newspapers and periodicals, in meetings, and in conversations. The new atmosphere and new achievements since the Czechoslovak Socialist Cultural Congress show that an extremely valuable step has been taken on the road to completing the socialist cultural revolution. It makes everyone see more clearly the dawn of the victory of the Czechoslovak cultural revolution rising in the face.

    文化战线上的新气象
    ——捷克斯洛伐克社会主义文化代表大会以来
    本报记者　杨翊
    嘹亮的号角
    今年6月，正当布拉格美好的初夏时节，在著名的伏契克公园的代表大会大厦里，嘹亮地吹起了社会主义文化革命的号角。它是出席捷克斯洛伐克社会主义文化代表大会的两千多名代表共同吹响的，它胜利地实现了在思想领域中进行社会主义革命的动员，鲜明地显示了捷克斯洛伐克文化工作者决心同工农群众一道，在共产党领导下奋勇前进的共同意志。
    社会主义文化代表大会的召开是三年来捷共文化工作方针和政策的胜利总结。生活在布拉格的人都能清楚地回想起，就在1956年夏天，由于国际资产阶级和修正主义思潮的冲击，捷克斯洛伐克文化界也曾涌现一小股逆流。他们否定解放以来捷克斯洛伐克社会主义文化的成就，自封为所谓“民族良心”，反对艺术的思想性，主张艺术不应为政治服务。从1956年举行的捷克斯洛伐克作家联盟第二次代表大会开始，捷共对这种错误倾向进行了耐心的说服和教育，也展开了尖锐的批评和斗争，因而达到了争取和团结这少数误入歧途的文化工作者的目的，使他们重新回到社会主义的旗帜下来。这一新的团结就使得捷共有可能在新的历史阶段，以社会主义文化代表大会作为起点，进一步动员、组织和教育广大人民群众，特别是文化界，来共同完成社会主义文化革命的神圣使命。大会正是这样进行的。参加大会的不仅有文化界的知名人士，还有上千来自工厂、农村、部队的文化工作者和基层党组织工作者。他们共同探讨了在人们思想上和精神生活中实现社会主义革命的问题，研究了农村群众文化工作的途径以及教育与生产和劳动相结合的方针。在文艺方面，“让文化接近生活，让文化工作者接近人民”的口号和“创造以现代生活为题材的作品”的呼声，得到了广泛的支持和响应。到群众中去，
  到生活中去
    深入生活和接近群众是作家和艺术家们旺盛的创作灵感的泉源，捷克斯洛伐克文化工作者从以往的教训中体会到这点，因而产生了“到群众中去，到生活中去”的日益强烈的要求。捷共和各个艺术家协会组织也大力支持和协助作家和艺术家们这种自觉的行动。半年来，不仅艺术家们同劳动人民的传统友谊得到加强，同时还建立了许多新的纽带。
    今年下半年轰动一时的事件之一，是享有盛名的捷克民族剧院和斯洛伐克民族剧院相互进行了十多年来的第一次访问演出，特别是荣膺国家最高勋章——共和国勋章的捷克民族剧院用了一个多月的时间，前往全国各地，深入工厂、农村和部队，为城乡劳动人民和人民军战士作了多次表演。这次巡回演出加强了戏剧工作者和劳动人民之间的血肉联系，每次演出后，导演、演员都和观众们在一起座谈，听取他们的意见和要求。在总结这次巡回演出的收获时，许多演员都说，只有在同广大群众接触中，才能真正体会到艺术为劳动人民服务的重要意义。
    布拉格的柯摩尔内剧院同捷卡德—杜克拉机械工厂建立了密切联系，他们时常在排演时请工人来看，要求他们提出意见。演员也经常把和工人接近时发现的有意义的题材，提供给剧作家，作为他们创作的线索。
    最近在乌斯提州利托麦日泽县举行的“诗歌日”，也是加强艺术家同劳动人民联系的一种活动。诗人们在那里为群众举行了诗歌朗诵晚会，同他们进行了座谈，还访问了当地的各个村镇。这种形式显然有助于增强劳动人民对诗歌的影响，并大大丰富诗人创作的泉源。
    除了戏剧、音乐、诗歌、美术等领域的艺术家经常到工厂和农村去体验生活，通过讨论会与其他形式同劳动人民打成一片外，捷克斯洛伐克作家也时常去各地访问，同工人、农民举行各种座谈，熟悉他们的读者的生活，发掘有关现实生活的题材。许多作家都有自己的“据点”，他们不时前往探视，或者定期在那里生活、劳动和工作。半年来已有不少作家和文学报刊的编辑下到中小城市和工厂农村，准备较长时间在那里定居，有的去当拖拉机手和合作社员，有的去做文化宣传工作。现在，党和作家联盟正动员和组织更多的作家下乡下厂，深入生活和群众，掀起社会主义现实主义创作的高潮。
    创作上升时期的开始
    文化能在生活中扎根，就能开花结果。捷克斯洛伐克著名文艺理论家、捷共中央社会科学院院长斯托尔教授最近在回答记者询问时，曾肯定地指出，自从社会主义文化代表大会以来，捷克斯洛伐克已出现创作上升时期，在小说、诗歌、特写、戏剧、电影等领域中产生了一批新的、以社会主义革命和建设为题材的好作品。作家马莱克在去到煤钢中心俄斯特拉发体验生活后，已写出一些反映工业建设和矿工生活的短篇。作家斯特赫里克以农村为题材的小说是他下乡生活的结晶。诗人赫鲁宾在同群众接近和座谈后，也创作了长诗“青枝绿叶”。作家米拉茨、赫茨柯和帙热卓夫斯基等人的作品都表现出对于现代生活的真实正确的描写，他们颂扬解放后人们的新品质，揭露资产阶级个人主义的残余，刻划了旧知识分子的转变。
    戏剧方面也开始有些新的尝试，剧作家恰赫的剧本“大娘”，反映了当前农业生产合作社中的问题，达内克的新作“正视”也接触到新的题材，描写了一个坚强的革命者和他的女儿的故事。在新的戏剧年度，各地剧院大量献演了以现代生活为题材的剧目，单是话剧方面就有四分之一的剧目是反映今天的生活的。连一向主要上演古典戏剧的捷克民族剧院，今年也演出三个现代话剧，其中之一是青年作家托波尔的描写青年问题的话剧“他们的生活”。为了推动各个剧种更多演出反映现代生活的剧目，捷克斯洛伐克戏剧界今年下半年还组织了现代话剧、歌剧、芭蕾舞剧和木偶戏等的会演和讨论。
  电影是接触现代题材最多的艺术项目，今年下半年上映的斯洛伐克影片“戴巴茨上尉”，反映了斯洛伐克民族起义的壮举，获得观众的好评。正在拍摄中的还有描绘克拉德诺轧钢厂的建设、俄斯特拉发工业基地的情景以及捷克斯洛伐克早期工人运动的发展的影片。
    由于社会主义文化代表大会的召开距离现在不过半年，而艺术创作常需要较长的时间，目前许多优秀的作品还正在创作的过程中，许多作家和艺术家都在从事为迎接明年捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年而展开的创作竞赛，因此大会的成果将在这批作品发表时更充分、更有说服力地显示出来。群众的文化
    教育
    农村群众文化教育是社会主义文化代表大会注意的重点之一。它是贯彻“使文化更富有生活气息，使生活更富有文化”的口号的重要方面。为了调整社会主义文化革命的薄弱环节，捷共现在大力加强中小城镇和农村的文化生活。对劳动人民文化活动的领导，随着国家行政区划的即将改组，也将转移到各级地方党委，特别是县党委。各个行政区都将创办日报，建立出版社，设立电影制片厂和成立各种艺术家组织，使作家和艺术家更密切地接近生活。各个县将要开设包括各种学科的“人民艺术学校”，各地农村和小镇要普遍建立文化宫或俱乐部，通过各项途径来大批培养文化干部，开展群众性的文娱活动。各个艺术工作者协会也决定面向群众，在中小城镇以及工厂、农村，组织各种流动画展、巡回演出和教育性演奏会。对于青年作家和艺术工作者的培养，也是捷共当前文化工作的中心任务之一。据斯托尔教授对记者说，这一切的目的是使广大劳动人民成为社会主义文化革命的积极分子，使他们也同艺术家一样，成为社会主义文化的创造者。
    捷克斯洛伐克教育事业的新方针也在今年下半年付诸实行，从新学年起，大中小学都开始了教育与生产和生活密切结合的教学改革，根据具体情况，延长了学习年限，开设了生产实习课程，组织了各种义务劳动，以培养既有理论知识又有实际经验的新型知识分子。科学工作者也坚决执行了科学研究为社会主义生产建设服务的方针，许多科学家下到企业和农业合作社，或者同生产单位建立紧密联系，帮助它们解决工作中出现的新问题。
      在党的领导下前进
    斯托尔教授说，从社会主义文化代表大会以来，作家们更深地体会到党的领导作用。捷共对文化界主要进行思想领导，采用教育、说服和批评等办法。在各个艺术工作者协会中都设有党组，党组的成员通过谈话、座谈、讨论和发表文章，来说服、教育自己的伙伴。同时党员作家和艺术家们也以自己真实反映现实而又具有艺术力量的创作，作为党外同行的榜样，作为党的文化政策正确的明证。
    增强马克思列宁主义的文艺批评，发展马克思列宁主义的美学理论，也是捷共加强对文艺工作领导的方式之一。现在捷克斯洛伐克科学院和大学都注意培养文艺理论干部。捷共中央社会科学院也在探讨对解放后十五年来文学的评价和对捷克斯洛伐克二十年代、三十年代各种学派的批判。为了协助各级党组织领导和开展文化工作，捷共决定把社会主义文化代表大会召开前由文化工作者和其他各界人士代表组成的中央及地方筹备委员会的组织形式保留下来，它的任务是统一各个艺术工作者协会的努力，总结本国和其他社会主义国家文化工作的经验，并在本国具体条件下加以运用。
    捷克斯洛伐克提出的任务是要在六十年代完成社会主义建设，这种宏伟的前景，激动着每个文化工作者的心。在党的正确指引下，反对形形色色的资产阶级思潮，实现思想领域中社会主义变革的斗争，在报刊上，在会议中，在交谈里，时刻都在进行着。捷克斯洛伐克社会主义文化代表大会以来的新气象和新成就说明，在完成社会主义文化革命的路途上迈进了极其可贵的一步，它使每个人都更清楚地看到了迎面升起的捷克斯洛伐克文化革命胜利的曙光。
