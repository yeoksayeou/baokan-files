    Dream Experiment with Circuit Breaker
    Qu Lianzhi, Changxindian, Beijing
    Circuit breaker, so mischievous,
    Testing it unsuccessfully, truly anxious;
    Others' tests lead to completed work,
    My tests are still mired in the mud.
    Back in the dormitory, lying on the bed,
    Tossing and turning, blinking my eyes;
    Until four or five in the morning,
    I got up and went straight to the workshop;
    Inserting the cotter pin, busy testing,
    The master closely watching.
    Suddenly I heard the master say:
    "Okay, this test is really reliable!"
    Hearing this, I was overjoyed,
    Dancing and laughing with glee;
    Suddenly, with a "click" sound,
    I woke up and realized it was a dream;
    Rubbing my eyes, I looked at the ground,
    Ha! How ridiculous,
    I had knocked the pillow to the floor.

    梦中试验开闭器
    北京长辛店　屈连芝
    开闭器，真调皮，
    试验不成真着急；
    人家试验能交活，
    我做试验还?泥。
    回到宿舍床上躺，
    翻来复去眨眼皮；
    直到过夜四五点，
    起身直奔车间里；
    插上插销忙试验，
    师傅一旁看仔细。
    忽听师傅说了声：
    “行了，这次试验真不离！”
    我一听，高了兴，
    手舞足蹈笑嘻嘻；
    猛然咔咚一声响，
    惊醒才知在梦里；
    揉揉眼睛地上看，
    嗨！真可笑，
    枕头被我打落地。
