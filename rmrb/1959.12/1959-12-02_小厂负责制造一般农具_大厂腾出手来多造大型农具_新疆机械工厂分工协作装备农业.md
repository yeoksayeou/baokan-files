Small Factories Responsible for Manufacturing General Farm Tools, Large Factories Free to Produce More Large-scale Farm Tools
Xinjiang Machinery Factories Divide Labor and Cooperate to Equip Agriculture
Urumqi Dispatch of this Newspaper, December 1st - The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region's machinery industry is further implementing the policy of "walking on two legs," combining indigenous and foreign methods to produce a large number of new-style animal-powered farm tools to support the region's four hundred and fifty-one people's communes.

In recent years, Xinjiang's rural areas have progressed from primarily relying on simple iron farm tools for cultivation to a new stage of possessing a considerable number of various new-style farm tools. Currently, the area cultivated by various animal-drawn semi-mechanized farm tools throughout the region accounts for the following percentages of the total sown area: plows, 70.2%; ten-row seeders, 65.9%; tine harrows, 56.9%; harvesters, 32.4%. In order to accelerate agricultural technological transformation, the Autonomous Region Party Committee recently issued a call to all machinery industry workers in the region to vigorously support agricultural production.

In responding to this call from the Autonomous Region Party Committee, all machinery factories in the region expressed their determination to complete this glorious task entrusted by the Party. At the same time, they have taken effective measures to ensure the completion of the task. First, all machinery factories and farm tool repair and assembly plants (groups) were ranked and divided into three categories based on equipment conditions and technical strength, defining the production scope and tasks of each category of factory. The thirteen first-class factories, which are larger in scale and have relatively complete equipment, mainly manufacture and repair tractors, power threshers, various tractor-drawn farm tools, and some large-scale animal-powered farm tools. The products are allocated uniformly by the Autonomous Region. The twenty-nine second-class factories in the special districts and counties, which are smaller in scale and have less equipment, mainly produce animal-drawn semi-mechanized farm tools to supply the needs of their respective regions, with surpluses available to support other special districts and counties. They are also responsible for major and medium repairs of mechanized and semi-mechanized farm tools in their regions. The sixty-eight third-class factories and the more than one thousand three hundred repair plants (groups) of the people's communes mainly produce auxiliary farm tools or simple animal-powered farm tools, and also carry out medium and small repairs of animal-powered farm tools. In this way, the production tasks of the largest number of small farm tools and most semi-mechanized farm tools are assigned to small factories, giving full play to the role of small factories. At the same time, it enables large factories to concentrate their efforts on manufacturing mechanized farm tools and large-scale semi-mechanized farm tools.

In order to provide second and third-class factories with better technical equipment, the relevant leading departments have also stipulated that Urumqi Agricultural Machinery Factory, Kashi Agricultural Machinery Factory, and Yili General Machinery Factory, etc., should rush to produce two hundred and ten lathes to support the machinery factories and farm tool repair factories in various special districts and counties, without affecting their own farm tool manufacturing tasks.

After the region's machinery industry was classified and assigned, large factories such as Urumqi Agricultural Machinery Factory and Kashi Agricultural Machinery Factory have freed up their capacity to produce large-scale semi-mechanized farm tools urgently needed for next spring. By the end of this year, they will have produced five thousand double-wheeled double-furrow plows and one hundred and eighty tractor-drawn farm tools. Special district and county farm tool factories and commune farm tool repair factories (groups) have also relied on their own efforts to rush produce a large number of small farm tools such as deep plows, cultivators, tine harrows, carts, and small grain threshers.

    小厂负责制造一般农具　大厂腾出手来多造大型农具
    新疆机械工厂分工协作装备农业
    本报乌鲁木齐1日电　新疆维吾尔自治区机械工业正在进一步贯彻两条腿走路的方针，土洋并举，生产大量的新式畜力农具，支援全区四百五十一个人民公社。
    几年来，新疆农村已经从主要依靠简单铁制农具从事耕作，进到拥有相当数量的各种新式农具的新阶段。目前，全区由各种畜力牵引的半机械化农具耕作面积已占到总播种面积的：犁为70.2％，十行播种机为65.9％，丁齿耙为56.9％，收割机为32.4％。为了加速农业技术改造，最近，自治区党委又向全区机械工业职工提出大力支援农业生产的号召。
    全区各机械工厂在响应自治区党委这一号召时，一面表示决心，完成党交给的这一光荣任务，同时，还采取了有效措施，来保证任务的完成。首先把全部机械厂、农具修配厂（组）进行了排队，按设备条件和技术力量情况分为三类，划分了各类厂的生产范围和任务。规模较大的、设备比较完善的十三个一类厂，以制造和修理拖拉机、动力脱壳机、各种机引农具和一部分大型畜力农具为主，产品由自治区统一调拨；规模较小、设备较差的二十九个专区、县的二类厂，以生产畜力牵引的半机械化农具为主，供应本地区需要，多余的可以支援别的专区、县，同时担负本地区机械化农具和半机械化农具的大修和中修；六十八个三类厂和人民公社的一千三百多个修理厂（组），主要生产辅助农具或简单的畜力农具，同时进行畜力农具的中修和小修。这样就把数量最多的小型农具的全部和大部分半机械化农具的生产任务，都交给小厂，发挥了小厂的作用，同时，使大厂能集中力量制造机械化农具和大型的半机械化农具。
    为了使二、三类厂得到较好的技术装备，有关领导部门还规定乌鲁木齐农业机械厂、喀什农业机械厂和伊犁通用机械厂等工厂，在不影响本身担负的农具制造任务的前提下，赶制二百一十台车床，支援各专区、县的机械厂和农具修理厂。
    全区机械工业进行分类归口以后，乌鲁木齐农机厂、喀什农机厂等大厂已经腾出手来生产明春急需的大型半机械化农具，到今年年底，就将制出双轮双铧犁五千部，机引农具一百八十台。专区、县农具厂和公社农具修理厂（组）也自力更生，赶制了大批深耕犁、中耕器、丁齿耙、大车、小型谷物脱粒机等各种小型农具。
