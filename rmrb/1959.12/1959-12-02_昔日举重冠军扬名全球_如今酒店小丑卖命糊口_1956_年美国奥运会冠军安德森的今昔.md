Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th – According to "Soviet Sports," Paul Anderson, the American multiple heavyweight weightlifting world record holder and 1956 Olympic champion, has been reduced to being ruthlessly exploited by nightclub owners.

Anderson's name is very familiar to sports enthusiasts around the world. Weighing more than 160 kilograms, he was incredibly strong. Around 1955, he set world records for the heavyweight weightlifting total of 512.5 kilograms, the press of 185 kilograms, and the clean and jerk of 197.5 kilograms. In the 1956 Olympics, he won the heavyweight championship with a total score of 500 kilograms. However, like the fate of many outstanding athletes in capitalist countries, his golden age vanished quickly like a flash in the pan. After 1956, he became a "money tree" for nightclub owners, forced to do whatever the boss wanted.

In an American nightclub, shimmering with neon lights, ear-splitting jazz music blares. A large, fat man, dressed in a black leotard and a wide leather belt, blows a bass horn. Who would have thought that this is Paul Anderson, the 1956 US Olympic weightlifting champion?

The nightclub owner, seeing Anderson's extraordinary strength, initially asked him to attract customers with a "lifting silver vaults" act. A group of semi-nude women showered glittering US dollars into two safes placed at the front of the stage. Under the intense magnesium lights, silver dollars clanged as they filled the safes.

Then Anderson would lift them onto his shoulders. The boss would say to the audience, "Whoever can repeat this act gets the money." But who could lift the heavy silver vaults on the shoulders of this "world champion"?

The audience quickly grew tired of the "lifting silver vaults" act, so the boss came up with a new trick, asking Anderson to lift live people.

After lifting silver vaults and live people, Anderson fell into the hands of a new boss nicknamed "The Executioner." The boss drove this weightlifter to perform wrestling. In one year, he fought more than two hundred matches, earning a lot of dollars for the boss.

Before long, this show also lost its appeal. The new boss put up sensational advertisements: "Anderson plans to win back the world boxing championship for America! Anderson knocks down a wall with one punch!"

The shows changed one after another. When the boxing show was no longer popular, who knows what new show awaits Anderson. (Attached picture)

    昔日举重冠军扬名全球
    如今酒店小丑卖命糊口
    1956年美国奥运会冠军安德森的今昔
    新华社莫斯科30日电　据“苏联体育报”报道：美国的多次重量级举重世界纪录创造者、1956年奥运会冠军保尔·安德森已经沦为夜总会老板的无情榨取的对象。
    安德森的名字是各国体育爱好者所十分熟悉的名字。他体重一百六十多公斤，力大无比，1955年前后曾经创造了重量级举重总成绩五百一十二点五公斤，推举一百八十五公斤和挺举一百九十七点五公斤的世界纪录，并且在1956年奥运会上以五百公斤的总成绩，夺得重量级冠军。可是同资本主义国家中许多出色运动员的命运一样，他的黄金时代像昙花一现那样很快消逝。1956年以后他就沦落为夜总会老板的“摇钱树”，老板要他干什么就得干什么。
    在美国一个霓虹灯闪烁的夜总会里，刺耳的爵士音乐喧闹着。一个大胖子，身穿黑色紧身衣、腰束宽皮带吹起了低声喇叭。谁会想到这就是1956年美国的奥运会举重冠军安德森呢？
    夜总会的老板看到安德森膂力过人，开始时叫他以“举银柜”的节目来招揽客人。一群半裸的女人把闪闪发光的美元，向放在台口的两个保险柜内洒去。银洋在强烈镁光灯的照耀下，铿锵地装满了保险柜。
    之后安德森就把它抬上了肩。老板对观众说：“谁能重复这一节目，钱就给谁。”但是谁能举得起这位“世界冠军”肩上的沉重银柜呢？
    “举银柜”的节目观众很快就看腻了，于是老板就想出新花样，要安德森来举活人。
    举完银柜和活人，安德森落到了一个绰号叫“刽子手”的新老板手里。老板驱使这位举重家去演出摔跤。一年来他搏斗了两百多场，为老板挣得了不少美元。
    没有多久这个节目也不叫座了。新老板又贴出了耸人听闻的大字广告：“安德森打算为美国夺回世界拳击冠军，安德森一拳击倒一座墙！”
    节目一个接一个地换着，当拳击这个节目不再叫座的时候，不知道又有什么新的节目在等待着安德森。（附图片）
