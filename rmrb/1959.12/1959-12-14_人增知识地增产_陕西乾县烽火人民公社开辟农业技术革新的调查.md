People gain knowledge, land increases production
    --An Investigation of the Agricultural Technology Innovation in Fenghuo People's Commune, Qian County, Shaanxi

"In the past, the land listened to heaven, people listened to the land, and crops listened to natural conditions; now, people listen to the Party, the land listens to people, and crops listen to operational techniques!" This is the high praise of the members of the Fenghuo People's Commune in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, for vigorously engaging in agricultural cultivation technology innovation after the communization.

The Fenghuo Commune was established in early September 1958, merging thirty-eight advanced agricultural cooperatives from Xincheng and Qiandong townships. Within this commune, there was a Fenghuo Production Team, led by young farmer-scientist Wang Baojing, formerly known as the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative. They had been known for vigorously engaging in agricultural technology innovation since 1952. Over the past seven years, they have gradually achieved comprehensive innovation in the cultivation techniques of crops such as wheat, corn, and cotton, and have summarized a relatively mature set of corn high-yield experiences. The achievements of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative attracted many surrounding agricultural cooperatives, and people said enviously: "If only we could merge with the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative!" However, because the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative was small and its strength was weak, it could not further expand the scale of technological innovation and scientific research, and many people also said: "If only we could merge our cooperative to make it bigger!" Since 1958, this call has become increasingly louder. The great leap forward in agricultural production has made many production activities and technological reforms transcend the scope of agricultural cooperatives. Large-scale cooperation was carried out throughout the township. In order to find new ways to increase production and achieve large-scale high yields, it was necessary to have more manpower, material resources, and land for large-scale experimental research; however, Fenghuo, a small cooperative, could not afford this task. The township then transferred thirty-four outstanding young adults from seventeen agricultural cooperatives to form a professional experimental team to support Fenghuo Cooperative. Various cooperatives urgently needed to reform agricultural tools, but some had blacksmiths but no carpenters, and some had carpenters but no blacksmiths. The township had to organize all the craftsmen from various cooperatives to work together. The Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative wanted to set up a grain, cotton, and oil processing factory, and the Shenghuo Agricultural Cooperative wanted to build a pumping station to irrigate 1,000 mu of land. Since 1955, they had been preparing for three years, but they could not be built because the cooperatives were small, with little labor and little capital. Therefore, before the communization, the surrounding cadres and masses had been brewing the idea of merging the two townships into a large commune. At this time, a movement to establish people's communes was launched throughout the country and the province, and they raised the red flag of the people's commune high.

After the establishment of the commune, the glorious name of "Fenghuo" was continued, and the entire commune was led to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in vigorously engaging in agricultural technology innovation. In one year, it achieved brilliant achievements. The commune universally promoted the technological innovation experience of crops such as wheat, corn, and cotton. At the same time, Wang Baojing and the commune's agricultural technology school initially created a set of wide-row intercropping and interplanting cultivation system. In order to further exploit the potential of the land and solve the contradictions of crops competing for land, time, labor, fertilizer, and water, a "universal intercropping experiment" of three crops a year (corn, beans, and wheat) was carried out, making the annual grain output per mu reach more than 3,000 jin. In order to further solve the problem of ventilation and light transmission caused by dense planting of wheat, a series of experiments on utilizing light energy were carried out on a small area, and wheat-cotton intercropping experiments were carried out on a large area, all with significant yield increase effects. Due to the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" and the promotion of advanced experiences from within and outside the commune, the total grain output of the entire commune in the summer of 1959 was 16,445,685 jin, an increase of 60% compared with the total summer grain output of the Great Leap Forward in 1958; the unit area yield of wheat increased from 153 jin per mu in 1958 to 230 jin, winning the first special bumper harvest after communization. Among them, 12,859 mu of large-area high-yield fields had an average yield of 500 jin per mu; 123 mu of high-yield fields had an average yield of 800 jin per mu; and 7.2 fen of land had a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. In the autumn of 1959, although it suffered from more than 80 days of severe drought, the commune led all members to work hard and strengthen field management, and finally overcame the natural disaster. The total grain output for the year can reach 19,629,000 jin, an increase of 23.8% compared with the total grain output in 1958. With the growth of agricultural production, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and other diversified operations have also greatly developed. The commune and production teams have also established 84 small factories for agricultural product processing and sewing. The total industrial and agricultural output value of the entire commune can reach 4,332,763 yuan, an increase of 14% compared with 1958.

Facts over the past year have told us that the people's commune has opened up an infinitely broad road for agricultural technology innovation, enabling the characteristics of the original Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in terms of technology innovation and scientific research to be further developed and improved.

        Everyone Studies Science, Every Team Conducts Experiments

Everyone studies science, and every team conducts experiments. This is a prominent feature of the Fenghuo Commune in carrying out technological innovation and scientific research. This mass technological innovation movement did not start overnight but developed from small to large with the development of cooperativization and communization, after the struggle between advanced and backward ideas. During the period of mutual aid teams and elementary cooperatives, only three or five people, including Wang Baojing, conducted experiments on two or three mu of land. Many people were skeptical, and some people resolutely opposed new technologies. They said, "We've lived a lifetime, and we don't understand new technologies, but we still grow crops and harvest grain!" They believed that experimental research was a matter for experts, and that farmers engaging in experiments was "trying to pick stars from the sky" and "trying to put a halter on fleas." Upper-middle peasant Ma Shuxiu was a representative of the opposition at the time. He said, "No matter how capable you are, can you do better than me?" He used his old experience to grow corn in his private plot and compete with the cooperative's experimental field. That year, Ma Shuxiu's corn high-yield field also had a high output, with 460 jin, while the cooperative's corn high-yield field produced 1,500 jin, setting the highest record for corn high-yield in the country. Ma Shuxiu admitted defeat, talked about the benefits of new technologies everywhere, and actively participated in technological innovation activities, successively serving as the technology section chief and deputy director of the agricultural scientific research office of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative. The transformation of the opposition into activists educated many people and changed their attitude towards new technologies.

After the establishment of the People's Commune, due to the development of production relations, the collective consciousness of cadres and members was further enhanced. As Wang Baojing said, "In the past, when we engaged in technological innovation and scientific research, we only thought about how to mobilize the enthusiasm of more than 800 people and solve the production problems of a small cooperative with more than 2,000 mu of land; now we are considering how to mobilize the enthusiasm of more than 30,000 people and solve the production problems of the entire commune with 140,000 mu of land." The members' ideas have also changed, and they regard the technological achievements of the Fenghuo team as their own achievements. "Winning glory for the Fenghuo Cooperative" has become the most powerful slogan to mobilize the masses to engage in technological innovation. Due to the integration of government and commune, the commune's leadership over production and technological innovation is more direct and more powerful. Commune cadres lead production not only through general calls and inspections in an administrative manner but also combine administrative methods with special methods of leading production, personally planting experimental fields and conducting typical demonstrations. The first secretary of the commune party committee took the lead, organized more than 100 cadres, staff, and workers, and more than 20 members of the Qiandong Production Team, and opened up a "experimental field" of more than 20 mu. At the same time, more than 39,600 mu of cotton fields in the entire commune were divided into 280 high-yield squares, which were contracted by party organizations at all levels to specifically lead the mass movement of technological innovation.

Now, a technological innovation upsurge of "learning from Baojing, comparing with Baojing, and catching up with Baojing" has been set off in every production team of the entire commune. The number of activists participating in experimental research has increased from 614 in 1957 to 3,852, and the area of experimental fields has increased from 344 mu to 3,604 mu. Young people have started "Catching Up with Baojing Experimental Fields," and women have started "Learning from Qiuxiang Experimental Fields" (i.e., learning from the experience of cotton planting expert Zhang Qiuxiang to grow experimental fields). Even old men and women have started "Not Convinced Experimental Fields," saying, "Young people create miracles, we are not convinced, we will also grow a few mu and compare results in the fall."

Studying science and conducting experiments has become a new fashion throughout the commune. The classrooms of the technical school are often overcrowded. Everyone is vying to participate in the labor of planting experimental fields. At home, fathers learn from their sons, and daughters-in-law compete with their husbands. It is a common occurrence. In the market, the focus of young men's discussions is: who has come up with new tricks in experimental research, and who has created new records. The conditions for young men and women to find partners are also to see who has good production and who has high technology.

              Large-scale Popularization and Large-scale Improvement

Close integration of popularization and improvement is another important feature of the Fenghuo Commune in carrying out agricultural cultivation technology innovation. This feature is reflected in two aspects: on the one hand, there are both general high-yield experiments and more advanced original experiments; on the other hand, experiments are carried out while being promoted. However, before communization, only small-scale popularization and small-scale improvement could be achieved here. After communization, an unprecedented scale of large-scale popularization and large-scale improvement was realized.

Taking the content of experimental research as an example, the experiments conducted here before communization were indeed developing from low to high. However, at that time, more work was done in seed selection and fine seed breeding; in terms of cultivation techniques, only relatively simple experiments such as seed treatment and rational fertilization and rational irrigation were done; in terms of intercropping and interplanting, only wheat-cotton two crops and corn, sweet potato, and bean interplanting experiments were done. After communization, the number of experimental research projects increased greatly. Focusing on the "Eight-Character Charter" of agricultural production, a complete set of experiments to improve cultivation techniques was carried out; focusing on reforming the cultivation system, more than a dozen kinds of wide-row intercropping, interplanting, and sowing and spot planting in wheat or cotton fields were carried out; the collected crop varieties also increased from more than 100 to more than 300, and more advanced hybrid breeding experiments were being carried out; especially importantly, in the past, there were many experiments but few summaries. Now, there are more talents, and the division of labor is more detailed. It is possible to conduct scientific summaries of the results of the experiments, and even write books and establish theories to elevate practical experience to theory. This is an unprecedented large-scale improvement.

Taking the scale and speed of promotion as an example, the technological innovation of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative was also carrying out experiments and promoting them at the same time before communization. However, at that time, the scope of application of technological achievements was mainly limited to the more than 2,000 mu of land in a small cooperative. Although other agricultural cooperatives were also learning from the experience of the Fenghuo Cooperative, because they were not in the same cooperative, people were not of one mind, and there was a lack of unified organization and leadership, the technological promotion work progressed relatively slowly. After communization, the situation was very different. Taking high-yield fields as an example, in 1958, Xincheng and Qiandong townships only had two mu of wheat high-yield fields with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. In 1959, the entire commune had more than a dozen mu of wheat high-yield fields with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. In 1958, the two townships had only more than a dozen mu of corn high-yield fields with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu, and in 1959, the entire commune had more than 100 mu of corn high-yield fields with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. In 1958, the two townships had only two mu of cotton fields with a yield of more than 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, and in 1959, the entire commune had more than 20 mu of cotton fields with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu, of which six mu had a yield of more than 2,000 jin per mu. Taking large fields as an example, since 1957, Xincheng Township has been promoting many advanced technical measures of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative throughout the township, but after two years of promotion, they can only be applied to about 10% of the large fields. After the establishment of the commune, the entire commune quickly realized the use of improved varieties and strip planting; soft stubble sowing, warm soup seed soaking, and chemical seed dressing were implemented throughout; deep plowing, rational close planting, and pest and disease control technical measures were universally promoted; and 97% of the cotton fields and 70% of the corn fields implemented the wide and narrow row planting method. Now, the entire commune has a total of 30,000 mu of large-area high-yield fields, accounting for one-fifth of the total sown area, and more than half of the labor force in the entire commune has participated in labor in these high-yield fields. This is an unprecedented large-scale popularization.

Why can the Fenghuo Commune achieve such a large-scale popularization and large-scale improvement? On the one hand, it is because communization has promoted the ideological liberation and talent release of the broad masses of peasants; on the other hand, it is also because they have implemented a combination of professional teams and mass movements, and a combination of ideological education and practical demonstrations in the conditions of large communes and large populations.

Before the establishment of the commune, the labor force and land of the experimental fields were not fixed, but temporarily drew a few people from this team and a few mu of land from that team; the experiments were not frequent, and the records and summaries of the experiments were not complete. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to carry out more advanced experimental research. After communization, the commune extracted 150 mu of land and 76 outstanding young people to establish the commune's agricultural technology school, and each production team also established a "three-in-one" school combining production, learning, and experimentation, and established 321 professional experimental teams or professional experimental groups. These technical schools, professional experimental teams, and professional experimental groups respectively became the technical centers of the commune, brigade, and team, forming a powerful professional technical team combining the top and bottom. This professional team, on the one hand, implements a meticulous division of labor and conducts frequent scientific and technological experiments; on the other hand, it disseminates scientific knowledge and technical experience to the masses and effectively organizes the mass movement of technological innovation.

Before the establishment of the commune, great attention was paid to technological promotion work here. However, at that time, only a few people were conducting experiments on small plots of land, and the scale of publicizing technological achievements was not large enough. Many people still believed that adopting new technologies "others can do it, I can't do it," and "small areas can do it, large areas can't do it." After the establishment of the commune, each brigade and team had experimental fields and technical backbones; young girls and elementary school students also started "Fifteen Women's High-Yield Fields" and "Young Pioneers' Experimental Fields," respectively creating high-yield records of more than 1,000 jin of wheat per mu and more than 1,000 jin of seed cotton. At the same time, party organizations at all levels closely combined ideological education and technological promotion work, and adopted the method of "seeing if you don't believe it, teaching if you don't understand it, arguing if you don't understand it, and comparing if you are not convinced" to promote new technologies on a large scale, opening up a situation of large-scale experimentation and technological innovation throughout the commune.

        Integration of Scientific Research and Field Production

Before communization, especially in the use of labor, land, and capital, there were indeed some contradictions between the experimental fields and the large fields. After communization, these contradictions were fundamentally resolved. For example, conducting experiments is a meticulous task, which requires a lot of labor, and requires a group of relatively fixed and relatively skilled laborers; and after technological innovation in large-field production, it requires intensive cultivation, which also requires more labor. Therefore, during the cooperative period, contradictions often arose between the experimental group and the production team over labor. After communization, in terms of experimental research, there was a relatively frequent and relatively fixed professional technical team. In terms of large-field production, due to the unified organization and rational use of labor by the commune, efficiency was greatly improved and labor was greatly saved. In this way, the problem of experimental fields and large fields competing for labor was relatively thoroughly resolved. The Fenghuo Commune has a forestry station led by labor model Wang Desheng. This forestry station needed a large area of land for a forest farm two years ago. At that time, no agricultural cooperative was able to extract so much land. It was not until after communization that the commune extracted 120 mu of land from several neighboring production teams as a forest farm. Now, this forest farm has cultivated more than 500,000 saplings of various fruit trees. Using these saplings, in five years, it will be able to make the surrounding ninety-odd barren mountain gullies lush with trees and flowers and fruits all over the mountains. In terms of the use of funds, the agricultural technology school needed 6,000 yuan in the autumn of 1958 to conduct large-scale scientific experiments, but at that time, the entire commune's production expenses were only 4,000 yuan, which was not enough even if all of it was taken out. It was not until after communization that the funding problem was solved.

In short, the establishment of the people's commune fundamentally solved the problem of combining scientific research with production. Now, the scientific research engaged in by the Fenghuo Commune is all practical problems raised in large-field production. After experimental research, new measures to increase production are found, and they are immediately applied to large-field production. Production and research are closely combined and promote each other, with production as the center and purpose. This is also a basic feature and important experience of the Fenghuo Commune in carrying out technological innovation.

            Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods, Learning from Each Other's Strengths

The technological innovation and scientific research work of the Fenghuo Commune has always been carried out in combination with agricultural technicians. Since the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, due to the urgent need for further development of production and the unified leadership of the commune, and also because schools and scientific institutions have further implemented the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor and theory with practice, the combination of the Fenghuo Cooperative and scientific and technical personnel has become closer, and the scope has been broadened, the scale has been enlarged, the planning has been strengthened, and the content has become richer. The Northwest Agricultural College and the Fenghuo Commune signed a comprehensive cooperation contract. More than 100 teachers and students were successively dispatched to live in various production teams throughout the commune, focusing on the Fenghuo team, to conduct production internships and labor training. The Northwest Institute of Biology and Soil and the Provincial Meteorological Bureau also sent cadres to help with the work. These scientific and technical personnel respectively served as teachers in agricultural technical schools and "three-in-one" schools, and helped various production teams to conduct experimental research and disseminate technical experience. These scientific and technical personnel have cultivated a group of agricultural technical backbones who can do and speak for the Fenghuo Cooperative, and have helped the Fenghuo Cooperative to systematically summarize the technical experience of high-yield experiments in recent years, enabling the scientific research of the Fenghuo Cooperative to be continuously improved.

Another important feature of the Fenghuo Cooperative's implementation of the combination of indigenous and foreign methods is to fully absorb the rich experience of experienced farmers. Experienced farmers participate in the experimental fields of various production teams. The Fenghuo Production Team has also specially set up an experienced farmers' advisory group. Whenever major problems are encountered in production or technology, they invite scientific and technical personnel, experienced farmers, and activists to jointly "consult" and seek correct solutions. For example, the wheat experimental field in 1959 grew too densely. During the "consultation," some advocated cutting leaves, and some advocated using ropes to pull open some row spacing. The experienced farmer said: Thinning seedlings is a must! The result proved that the effect of thinning seedlings was the best. Some of Wang Baojing's bold experiments and creations are also based on the experience of experienced farmers. For example, he wanted to conduct a wheat-cotton two-crop experiment, so he consulted with experienced farmers, and as a result, he found a basis. Originally, people here had long harvested barley intercropped with cotton. One year, because of the drought, cotton was not planted until after the wheat harvest, and each mu yielded 70 to 80 jin of lint cotton. Therefore, Wang Baojing resolutely conducted the wheat-cotton two-crop experiment and succeeded. Wang Baojing's experiments on intercropping and interplanting and utilizing light energy were also inspired by the experience of experienced farmers that "the edge rows grow well." The good things from abroad should be learned, and the good things passed down from our ancestors cannot be discarded! This is their conclusion.

              New Farmers Are Growing

After communization, the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of people has been greatly improved, and their creativity has been further developed. While vigorously engaging in agricultural cultivation technology innovation, the entire commune is also carrying out tool reform. Twenty-six kinds of agricultural tools have been created and reformed, with 3,100 pieces, and they are also mastering modern machines. For example, Guo Yaotong and Wang Sicong of the Xinglong Production Team can be said to be self-taught engineers. The two of them installed a complete set of diesel engine equipment for the grain and cotton processing factory for the commune and four production teams, and also created an automatic wheat screening machine.

After the establishment of the People's Commune, the broad masses of members not only further improved their political consciousness, but also increased their scientific knowledge and improved their cultural level in the process of vigorously engaging in agricultural technology innovation and scientific research. It is truly "people gain knowledge, land increases production." Through vigorously engaging in the high-yield experimental field movement, and through agricultural technical schools and the amateur schools of various teams, 511 agricultural technicians with certain scientific knowledge have been trained. Among these people, 440 have reached the primary school level of education, and 35 have reached the middle school level. Among the more than 8,000 young adults in the entire commune, 80% have become literate, and the rest are expected to become literate in the spring of 1960. Therefore, in the Fenghuo Commune, new types of farmers with both production experience, political consciousness, and certain cultural and scientific knowledge have emerged and are growing rapidly. They are gradually narrowing the distance between manual and mental labor and are making rapid progress on the road of socialist construction.

The new farmers of this commune want to increase the total industrial and agricultural output value by 1.5 times in 1960 to 1962 compared with 1959. Among them, the total grain output will increase by one time, with an average yield of 500 jin per mu. The total cotton output will increase by 1.5 times, with an average yield of 150 jin of lint cotton per mu. They want to comprehensively carry out technological innovation in agricultural production, not only to universally improve and improve cultivation techniques, so that the land of the entire commune basically reaches the level of high-yield fields, but also to seize the initiative to carry out innovation in production tools and strive to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization. They want to carry out agricultural scientific research work more deeply, and want every production team to have a relatively sound scientific research office, and every team to have three or several technicians who have reached the level of secondary agricultural technical schools. The Fenghuo Production Team wants to develop into a scientific experimental farm of the commune, and research a set of concrete plans and operating procedures that are completely suitable for the commune's conditions and implement the "Eight-Character Charter" of agricultural production, and further open up the road to high-yield production.

Now, all the members are advancing towards this goal with full confidence!

    人增知识地增产
    ——陕西乾县烽火人民公社开辟农业技术革新的调查
    “过去是地听天的话，人听地的话，庄稼听自然条件的话；现在是人听党的话，地听人的话，庄稼听作业技术的话！”这是陕西省乾县烽火人民公社的社员们，对于公社化后大搞农业耕作技术革新的崇高评价。
    烽火公社是1958年9月初，由新城、阡东两乡的三十八个高级农业合作社合并成立的。这个公社里有一个由青年农民科学家王保京领导的烽火生产队，过去叫烽火农业合作社。他们从1952年起，就以大搞农业技术革新出名。七年来，他们在小麦、玉米和棉花等作物栽培技术方面，逐步实现了全面革新，并且总结出一套比较成熟的玉米丰产经验。烽火农业社的成就吸引着周围的许多农业社，人们羡慕地说：“要是咱们和烽火农业社并成一个社就好了！”而烽火农业社因为社小，力量单薄，不能进一步扩大技术革新和科学研究的规模，也有许多人说：“要是把咱们的社并大就好了！”1958年以来，这种呼声愈来愈高了。农业生产的大跃进，使许多生产活动和技术改革超越了农业社的范围。进行了全乡大协作。为了寻找新的增产途径和实现大面积丰产，需要有更多的人力、物力和土地，进行大规模的试验研究；但是烽火一个小社担负不起这个任务，乡上就从十七个农业社抽调了三十四个优秀的青壮年，组成专业试验队，支援烽火社。各社急需进行农具改革，但是有的有铁匠没木匠，有的有木匠没铁匠，乡上只好把各社的匠人全部组织起来干。烽火农业社想办一个粮棉油加工厂，胜火农业社想建一个灌溉一千亩地的抽水站，从1955年开始，筹办了三年，都因为社小，劳力少，资金少，办不起来。所以，在公社化以前，周围的干部和群众就酝酿着想把两乡合一并成大社。正在这个时候，全国、全省开展了建立人民公社的运动，他们就高高举起了人民公社的红旗。
    公社成立以后，沿用了“烽火”这个光荣的名字，领导全体社员继承和发扬了烽火农业社大搞农业技术革新的光荣传统，在一年的时间里，就获得了辉煌的成就。全公社普遍推广了小麦、玉米和棉花等作物的技术革新经验。同时，王保京和公社的农业技术学校，又初步创造出一套宽行套种间作的耕作制度。为了进一步发挥土地潜力，解决作物争土地、争时间、争劳力、争肥料、争水份等矛盾，进行了一年三熟（玉米、豆子和小麦）的“万能套种试验”，使一亩田年产粮食达到三千多斤。为了更进一步地解决小麦密植后所引起的通风透光问题，在小面积进行了一系列利用光能的试验，又在大面积进行了麦棉套种的试验，都有显著的增产效果。由于认真贯彻了“八字宪法”，推广了本社和外社的先进经验，全公社1959年夏季粮食总产量一千六百四十四万五千六百八十五斤，比大跃进的1958年夏粮总产量增长60％；小麦单位面积产量，由1958年亩产一百五十三斤，提高到二百三十斤，赢得公社化后第一个特大丰收。其中一万二千八百五十九亩大面积丰产田，平均亩产五百斤；一百二十三亩高额丰产田，平均亩产八百斤；内有七亩二分地，亩产达到千斤以上。1959年秋季作物，虽然遭到了八十多天大旱，但是公社领导全体社员奋发苦干，加强田间技术管理，终于战胜了天灾。全年粮食总产量可达一千九百六十二万九千斤，比1958年粮食总产量增长23.8％。随着农业生产的增长，林、牧、副业等多种经营也有很大发展。公社和生产队还兴办了农产品加工、缝纫等小型工厂八十四个。全公社工农业总产值可达四百三十三万二千七百六十三元，比1958年增长14％。
    一年来的事实告诉我们：人民公社为农业技术革新开辟了无限广阔的道路，它使原来烽火农业社在技术革新和科学研究方面的特点，得到更进一步的发展和提高。
        人人学科学　队队搞试验
    人人学科学，队队搞试验，这是烽火公社进行技术革新和科学研究的一个显著特点。这种群众性的技术革新运动，并不是一下子就搞起来的，而是随着合作化和公社化的发展，经过先进思想与落后思想的斗争，由小到大地发展起来的。在互助组和初级社时期，只有王保京等三、五个人在两三亩土地上作试验。许多人抱着怀疑态度，还有一些人坚决反对新技术。他们说：“活了一辈子，不懂新技术，照样种庄稼，照样打粮食！”他们以为试验研究是专家的事情，农民搞试验是“想上天摘星星”，是“想给跳蚤挽笼头”。上中农马书秀就是当时反对派的代表。他说：“你们本事再大，还能做得过我？”他用老经验在自留地里种玉米，要和合作社的试验田比高低。这一年，马书秀的玉米丰产田产量也不低，有四百六十斤，而合作社的玉米丰产田却打了一千五百斤，创造了全国玉米丰产的最高纪录。马书秀认输了，到处对人讲新技术的好处，积极地参加了技术革新的活动，先后担任了烽火农业社的技术股长和农业科学研究室的副主任。反对派变成积极分子，使许多人受到教育，改变了对新技术的态度。
    人民公社成立以后，由于生产关系的发展，干部和社员的大集体观念，更加增强了，正像王保京所说：“我们搞技术革新和科学研究，过去脑子里想的只是怎样调动八百多人的积极性，解决一个小社，两千多亩土地的生产问题；现在考虑的是，怎样调动三万多人的积极性，解决全公社十四万亩土地的生产问题。”社员们的观念也改变了，他们把烽火队的技术成果看作是自己的成果，“为烽火社争光”成为动员群众大搞技术革新的最有力的口号。由于政社合一，公社对生产的领导、对技术革新的领导，更加直接、更加有力了。公社干部领导生产，不限于一般的号召和检查的行政方式，而是把行政方式和领导生产的特殊方式结合起来，亲自动手种试验田，进行典型示范。公社党委第一书记挂帅，组织了一百多个干部、职工和阡东生产队的二十多个社员，开辟了二十多亩地的一块“试验田”，同时又把全公社的三万九千六百多亩棉田，划为二百八十个丰产方，由各级党组织分工包干，具体领导，大搞技术革新的群众运动。
    现在，全社各个生产队都掀起了“学保京、比保京、赶保京”的技术革新热潮。全社参加试验研究的积极分子由1957年的六百一十四人增加到三千八百五十二人，试验田的面积由三百四十四亩增加到三千六百零四亩。青年们搞起“赶保京试验田”，妇女们搞起“学秋香试验田”（即学习植棉能手张秋香的经验来种试验田）。就连老汉、老婆婆，也搞起了“不服气试验田”，他们说：“青年创奇迹，我们不服气，也来搞几亩，秋后比高低。”
    学科学、搞试验，已经成为全社的新风尚。技术学校的课堂经常拥挤不堪。对于参加种试验田的劳动，人人争先恐后。在家里，父亲向儿子学习，媳妇同丈夫比赛，已是习闻常见的事情。在集市上，小伙子们议论的中心是：在试验研究方面，谁又出了新花样，谁又创造了新纪录。青年男女们找对象的条件也是看谁的生产好，看谁的技术高。
              大普及　大提高
    普及和提高密切结合，这是烽火公社进行农业耕作技术革新的另一重要特点。这个特点表现在两方面：一方面是，既有一般的丰产试验，又有比较高级的独创性的试验；另一方面是，一边试验，一边推广。不过，在公社化以前，这里还只能做到小普及、小提高，公社化以后才实现了空前规模的大普及、大提高。
    拿试验研究的内容来说，在公社化以前，这里所作的试验，固然也是由低级到高级地发展着，不过，当时在选种和良种繁殖方面，做得比较多；而在耕作栽培技术方面，只是做了种子处理和合理施肥、合理灌溉等比较简单的试验，在间作、套种方面，也只做了麦棉两熟和玉米、红薯、豆子套种的试验。公社化以后，试验研究的项目大大增加了。围绕着农业生产“八字宪法”，进行了一整套改进耕作栽培技术的试验；围绕着改革耕作制度，进行了十几种宽行套种、间作和在麦田或棉田进行捎种、点种的试验；征集的作物品种也由一百多种增加到三百多种，并且进行着更高级的杂交育种试验；特别重要的是，过去试验的多，总结的少，现在，人才多了，分工细了，能够对试验的成果进行科学的总结，甚至著书立说，把实践经验提高到理论上来。这是从来未有的大提高。
    拿推广的规模和速度来说，在公社化以前，烽火农业社的技术革新，也是一边试验、一边推广的。不过那时候，技术成果应用的范围，主要的限于一个小社的两千多亩土地上，其他农业社虽然也在学习烽火社的经验，但是，因为不是一个社，人心不齐，又缺乏统一的组织领导，技术推广工作进行得比较慢。公社化以后，情况就大不相同了。拿高额丰产田来说，1958年，新城、阡东两个乡只有二亩亩产一千多斤的小麦丰产田。1959年，全公社有了十几亩亩产千斤以上的小麦丰产田。1958年两个乡亩产千斤以上的玉米丰产田，只有十几亩，1959年全公社有一百多亩玉米亩产千斤以上。1958年两个乡只有两亩棉田亩产籽棉一千多斤，1959年全公社共有二十几亩棉田亩产千斤以上，其中有六亩亩产二千多斤。拿大田来说，从1957年起，新城乡就在全乡范围推广烽火农业社的许多先进技术措施，但是，推广了两年，还只能在大约10％的大田里应用。公社成立以后，全社迅速实现了良种化、条播化；全部实行了软茬播种、温汤浸种和药剂拌种；普遍推行了深翻地、合理密植和防治病虫害的技术措施；有97％的棉田和70％的玉米田实行了宽窄行播种法。现在，全社共有大面积丰产田三万亩，占播种总面积五分之一，全社有半数以上的劳力在这些丰产田里参加过劳动。这是从来未有的大普及。
    烽火公社为什么能够实现这样的大普及、大提高呢？一方面是由于公社化促进了广大农民思想解放，才华焕发；另一方面也是由于他们在社大、人多的条件下，实行了专业队伍和群众运动结合，思想教育和实例示范结合的方法。
    公社成立以前，试验田的劳动力和土地都不固定，而是临时从这个队抽几个人，从那个队抽几亩地；试验不经常，试验的记载和总结也不完整。在这种情况下，要进行比较高级的试验研究是困难的。公社化以后，社里抽出一百五十亩土地和七十六个优秀青年，建立了公社农业技术学校，各个生产队也建立了生产、学习、试验相结合的“三合一”学校，建立了三百二十一个专业试验队或专业试验组，这些技术学校、专业试验队、专业试验组分别成为社、大队、小队的技术中心，组成一支上下结合的强大的专业技术队伍。这支专业队伍，一方面实行细密的分工，进行经常的科学技术试验；一方面向群众传播科学知识和技术经验，有效地组织技术革新的群众运动。
    公社成立以前，这里对技术推广工作就很注意。不过，当时还只有少数人在小块土地上作试验，宣传技术成果的规模也不够大。许多群众还认为，采用新技术“别人能行自己不行”，“小面积能行，大面积不行”。公社化以后，各个大队、小队都有了试验田，都有了技术骨干；年轻姑娘和小学生也搞起了“十五女丰产田”、“红领巾试验田”，分别创造了亩产小麦千斤以上和籽棉千斤以上的丰产纪录。同时，各级党组织又把思想教育和技术推广工作密切结合起来，采取“不信就看，不懂就教，不通就辩，不服就比”的方法，大规模地推广新技术。打开了全社性的大搞试验研究和技术革新的局面。
        科学研究与大田生产结合
    在公社化之前特别是在劳动力、土地、资金的使用上，试验田和大田之间，的确还有一些矛盾。公社化以后，这些矛盾才得到根本的解决。例如，搞试验是细活，费工多，而且需要一批比较固定、比较熟练的劳动力；而大田生产在大搞技术革新以后，要实行精耕细作，花费的劳动力也比较多了。因此，在合作社时期，试验组和生产队之间常常发生争劳动力的矛盾。公社化以后，在试验研究方面，有了一支比较经常、比较固定的专业技术队伍。在大田生产方面，由于公社统一组织、合理使用劳动力，效率大大提高，劳力大大节省。这样，就比较彻底地解决了试验田和大田争劳动力的问题。烽火公社有一个由劳动模范王德生领导的林业站，这个林业站前两年就需要大块土地作林场，当时哪一个农业社都无力抽出这样多的土地，直到公社化以后才由公社从邻近的几个生产队抽出了一百二十亩土地作为林场。现在，这个林场，已经培育出各种果树苗五十多万株，运用这些树苗，在五年之后就能使周围九十几道荒凉的山沟绿树成荫，花果满山。在资金的使用方面，1958年秋天农业技术学校要搞大面积科学试验，需要六千元资金，但当时全社的生产费用才只有四千元，全部拿来也是不够的。公社化以后，才解决了资金问题。
    总之，人民公社的成立从根本上解决了科学研究同生产结合的问题。现在，烽火公社所从事的科学研究，都是大田生产中提出的实际问题，经过试验研究，找到新的增产措施，立即拿到大田生产中去应用。生产和研究密切结合、互相促进，而以生产为中心、为目的。这
  也是烽火公社进行技术革新的一个基本特点和重要经验。
            土洋结合　取长补短
    烽火公社的技术革新与科学研究工作，始终是和农业技术人员结合进行的。大跃进和人民公社化以来，由于进一步发展生产的迫切需要和公社的统一领导，也由于学校和科学机关进一步贯彻了党的教育与生产劳动相结合、理论与实践相结合的方针，烽火社与科学技术人员的结合，更密切了，而且范围广了，规模大了，计划性强了，内容更丰富了。西北农学院和烽火公社签订了全面协作合同。先后派师生一百多人，以烽火队为重点，分住到全公社各个生产队，进行生产实习和劳动锻炼。西北生物土壤研究所和省气象局也派来干部帮助工作。这些科学技术人员分别担任了农业技术学校和“三合一”学校的教员，并且帮助各生产队进行试验研究，传播技术经验。这些科学技术人员给烽火社培养了一批会做会讲的农业技术骨干，帮助烽火社系统地总结了几年来丰产试验的技术经验，使烽火社的科学研究能够不断地提高。
    烽火社实行土洋结合的另一个重要特点，就是充分吸取老农的丰富经验。各生产队的试验田都有老农参加。烽火生产队还专门设立了老农参谋团。每当生产上、技术上碰到重大问题的时候，他们就请科学技术人员、老农同积极分子共同“会诊”，寻求正确方案。比如1959年的小麦试验田，长的过密了，在“会诊”的时候，有的主张剪叶子，有的主张用绳子拉开一些行距，老农说：非间苗不可！结果证明间苗的效果最好。王保京有一些大胆的试验和创造，也是以老农的经验做根据的。比如他想搞麦棉两熟的试验，就找老农一起研究，结果找到了根据。原来，这里很早以前就有人收过大麦套种棉花，有一年因为天旱，直拖到麦收以后才种棉花，每亩都收过七、八十斤皮棉。因此，王保京就坚决地进行了麦棉两熟的试验，并且成功了。王保京进行套种间作、利用光能的试验，也是由于受了“边行长的好”这种老农经验的启发。外国来的“洋”的好东西要学习，老祖宗传下来的好东西也不能丢！这就是他们的结论。
              新农民在成长
    公社化以后广大群众劳动的自觉性大大提高，创造性也得到进一步的发挥。全公社在大搞农业耕作技术革新的同时，又在进行工具改革。已经创制和改制各种农具二十六种、三千一百多件，并且还正在掌握现代化的机器。例如兴隆生产队的郭尧通和王思聪，可以说是“无师自通”的土工程师。他们两人给公社和四个生产队安装了粮棉加工厂的全套柴油机设备，还创造了自动筛麦机。
    人民公社成立以后，广大社员不但进一步提高了政治觉悟，而且在大搞农业技术革新和科学研究当中，增长了科学知识，提高了文化水平。真是“人增知识地增产”。公社通过大搞丰产试验田运动，通过农业技术学校和各队的业余学校，已经培养出具有一定科学知识的农业技术员五百一十一人。这些人的文化水平，达到小学程度的有四百四十人，达到中学程度的有三十五人。全公社八千多个青壮年中，已经有80％脱了盲，其余的人，预计在1960年春天可以全部脱盲。所以，在烽火公社里，既有生产经验、又有政治觉悟和一定文化科学知识的新型农民，已经出现并在迅速成长着。他们正在逐步缩小着体力劳动和脑力劳动的距离，在社会主义建设的大路上突飞猛进。
    这个公社的新型农民要在1960到1962年内，使工农业总产值比1959年提高一倍半。其中粮食总产量增长一倍，平均亩产达到五百斤。棉花总产量增长一倍半，平均亩产皮棉一百五十斤。他们要全面地进行农业生产的技术革新，不仅要普遍改进和提高耕作技术，使全社土地基本上达到丰产田的水平，而且还要抓紧进行生产工具的革新，争取实现机械化和半机械化。他们要更加深入地开展农业科学的研究工作，要使每一个生产队都有比较健全的科学研究室，每一个小队都有三几个达到中等农业技术学校水平的技术员。烽火生产队要发展成为公社的科学试验农场，研究出一套完全适合本社情况的、贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”的具体方案和操作规程，进一步开辟高额丰产的道路。
    现在，全体社员正在信心百倍地向着这个目标飞跃前进！
