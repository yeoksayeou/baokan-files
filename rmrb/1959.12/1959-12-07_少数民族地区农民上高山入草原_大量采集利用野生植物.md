Xinhua News Agency: In the rich and vast minority areas, the "Small Autumn Harvest" movement has achieved great results. Some people's communes have achieved careful harvesting and put all treasures into storage. In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, by early November, the purchase of *Imperata cylindrica* for papermaking alone reached 360,000 dan, an increase of 34% compared to the total purchase for the previous year. People's communes in the Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia Autonomous Regions, as well as the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan, have collected large amounts of wild fibers, wild oil plants, and various medicinal materials. According to incomplete statistics, the various ethnic farmers and herdsmen in Qinghai have collected more than 3 million dan of wild plants. The medicinal material harvesting teams of the people's communes in the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have collected nearly 6 million jin of medicinal materials such as rhubarb, fritillaria, and cordyceps. In the mountainous and resource-rich Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou, farmers of all ethnic groups are working with great enthusiasm, and by mid-November, they had collected 24.68 million dan of various mountain products.

The minority areas are extremely rich in wild plant resources. After the State Council issued instructions on mobilizing the masses to widely collect and fully utilize wild plant raw materials, Party committees at all levels in the minority areas strengthened their leadership, quickly organized professional teams, carried pots, brought food, and went to the mountains, into the forests, and into the grasslands to collect various wild plants. During agricultural breaks or holidays, some places were full of people collecting treasures. Some counties also established "Small Autumn Harvest" headquarters, first conducting investigations and research, making plans, and then mobilizing the masses for a concentrated effort. This unprecedented "Small Autumn Harvest" movement has laid a good foundation for expanding the utilization of wild plant resources in minority areas in the future.

The bumper harvest of the "Small Autumn Harvest" in the minority areas not only provided the country with a large amount of industrial raw materials and consumer goods but also increased the income of the people's communes and the people of all ethnic groups. In the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan, the average income per person in six counties including Barkam, Da Jin, and Maowen was 25 yuan. The value of mountain products sold to the state by the people of all ethnic groups in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture was 82.69 million yuan, with an average increase in income of 44.2 yuan per person in the prefecture.

Many local people's communes have achieved on-site material collection and on-site processing, putting wild plants into production and life faster and better. The Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province used more than 30 kinds of wild plants to weave carrying baskets, back baskets, sacks, hemp ropes, brooms, etc., to support winter water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaigns. Local commune industries are developing with the widespread implementation of the "Small Autumn Harvest," and a large number of simple wild plant processing plants and workshops have been established. The people's communes in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province already have more than 3,000 aromatic oil factories and 500 wineries. While collecting and processing, short-distance transportation in many areas is very active, and some rosin, medicinal materials, and other materials that have been accumulated in remote mountainous areas for a long time have been transported to county towns.

    少数民族地区农民上高山入草原
    大量采集利用野生植物
    据新华社讯　在富饶辽阔的少数民族地区，“小秋收”运动成绩巨大。有些人民公社做到精采细收，百宝归仓。广西僮族自治区到11月上旬，仅造纸原料龙须草一项，就收购了三十六万担，比去年全年收购量增加34％。新疆、内蒙古、宁夏等自治区和湖南湘西土家族苗族自治州的各人民公社，已经采集大量的野生纤维、野生油料以及各种药材。青海各族农牧民采集的野生植物，据不完全统计已有三百多万担。果洛藏族自治州各人民公社的采挖药材队，采得大黄、贝母、虫草等药材近六百万斤。在山多宝多的贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州，各族农民干劲冲天，到11月中旬已采摘各种山货二千四百六十八万担。
    各少数民族地区野生植物资源极其丰富。国务院发布关于发动群众广泛采集和充分利用野生植物原料的指示以后，少数民族地区各级党委加强领导，迅速组织了专业队，带锅背粮，上山、入林、进草原，采集各种野生植物。在农事间隙或假日，有的地方满山遍野都是采宝的人。有些县还成立“小秋收”指挥部，先调查研究、作规划，然后发动群众突击。这一规模空前的“小秋收”运动，为少数民族地区今后扩大野生植物的资源利用，打下了良好基础。
    少数民族地区“小秋收”的丰收，不仅为国家提供了大量的工业原料和消费资料，并且使人民公社和各族人民增加了收入。四川阿坝藏族自治州仅马尔康、大金、茂汶等六个县平均每人收入二十五元。黔东南苗族侗族自治州各族人民卖给国家的山货价值八千二百六十九万元，按人口平均计算，全州每人增加收入四十四点二元。
    许多地方的人民公社，做到了就地取材、就地加工，把野生植物更快更好地用到生产和生活中去。青海省海南藏族自治州利用三十多种野生植物，编制出抬筐、背斗、麻袋、麻绳、笤帚等，支援了冬季兴修水利和积肥运动。各地的公社工业正在随着“小秋收”的广泛开展而发展，大批简易的野生植物加工厂和作坊建立起来了。云南大理白族自治州各人民公社已有三千多个芳香油厂和五百个酒厂。在采集、加工的同时，很多地区的短途运输十分活跃，一些长期积压在偏僻山区的松香、药料等都已运到县城。
