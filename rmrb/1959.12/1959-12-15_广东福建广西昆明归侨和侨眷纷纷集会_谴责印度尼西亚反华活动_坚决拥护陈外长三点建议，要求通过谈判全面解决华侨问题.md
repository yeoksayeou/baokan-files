Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: In recent days, returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and Kunming have held rallies. They expressed their firm support for the three suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi on behalf of the Chinese government regarding a comprehensive solution to the Indonesian Overseas Chinese issue, strongly protested against the frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese activities carried out by the Indonesian reactionary forces, and warmly welcomed those overseas Chinese who have been persecuted and cannot continue to live in Indonesia to return to the country to participate in construction.

Returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in Guangzhou, Shantou, Haikou, Chao'an, Huizhou and other cities and counties in Guangdong Province held rallies. Many returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia condemned the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia at a rally held in Guangzhou on the 12th. Zhang Weixin said that a relative of his had just returned to China from Indonesia, and he felt very indignant about the atrocities of the anti-Chinese elements in the countryside that this relative had described. He firmly demanded that the Indonesian authorities immediately stop the anti-Chinese atrocities. More than 300 returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese who are attending the Shantou Special Zone's agricultural, financial and trade advanced collectives and advanced producer representatives conference in Shantou City, held a meeting and passed a resolution supporting the three suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi on comprehensively resolving the issue of overseas Chinese through negotiations, protesting the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia, and firmly demanding that the Indonesian government respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, and immediately stop all anti-Chinese actions. At a rally held by returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Haikou City on the 12th, Liang Yuemei, a relative of overseas Chinese, said that more than a dozen members of her family are still in Indonesia, and she is extremely concerned about the fate of her relatives. She said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter represented the voice of the vast number of overseas Chinese, and we are very grateful to the government for resolutely safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. Zhan Lizhi, director of the largest state-owned overseas Chinese farm in the country - Xinglong Farm on Hainan Island, said that our government has always been deeply concerned about overseas Chinese. Xinglong Farm was established by the state specifically to settle returned overseas Chinese. A group of returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who recently returned to the farm to participate in construction have been properly settled, are actively engaged in production, and are living happily. He said that all members of the farm warmly welcome overseas Chinese who are displaced or unwilling to continue living in Indonesia to return to the motherland and join us in building the farm and building our hometown.

At a rally held by returned overseas Chinese in Fuzhou City, Ye Hongbao, vice chairman of the Fuzhou Overseas Chinese Federation and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that overseas Chinese, who have always been friendly with the Indonesian people, are today being treated with extreme rudeness as if they were nationals of hostile countries, and many overseas Chinese are in a miserable situation of displacement and destitution. Indonesia's barbaric and unreasonable persecution of overseas Chinese has damaged the traditional friendship between China and Indonesia, while making the imperialists clap their hands with joy, and fair-minded people and the broad masses of the Indonesian people will also feel uneasy and dissatisfied. Returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Xiamen, Quanzhou and other famous hometowns of overseas Chinese also held rallies. Lin Kefa, a member of the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Federation and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that the three suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi for a comprehensive solution to the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia are fully in line with the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries and the wishes of the overseas Chinese, and once again embody the motherland's kind concern for the overseas Chinese, and will surely be wholeheartedly supported by the vast number of overseas Chinese.

Returned overseas Chinese from various agencies and organizations in Nanning City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, held a rally on the 12th. Li Hanwei, vice chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Overseas Chinese Federation, strongly condemned and protested against Indonesia's anti-Chinese activities at the meeting. He said that Guangxi has settled more than 10,000 returned overseas Chinese in the past few years, and they are living and working in peace and contentment, and their lives are getting better and better. We warmly extend our hands to welcome overseas Chinese who are displaced or unwilling to continue living in Indonesia to return to the country to participate in construction. Yu Wancha, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who works at Guangxi University, said that his family is still suffering in Indonesia, and his brother, who runs a small business and has always been law-abiding, is also being persecuted. However, Western monopoly capital in Indonesia has not been touched at all. This is exactly falling into the trap of imperialism. Returned overseas Chinese students from major universities and middle schools in Nanning, Guilin, Wuzhou and other places have also held rallies or written letters to newspapers, expressing their full support for Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter.

Returned overseas Chinese in Kunming City also held a rally on the 12th. Huang Jiefa spoke on behalf of 32 returned overseas Chinese students studying at Kunming Medical College, saying that all of us students firmly oppose Indonesia's anti-Chinese activities, and we demand that the Indonesian government accept the three suggestions put forward by the Chinese government, and that the two sides hold negotiations to comprehensively resolve the overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries.

    新华社14日讯　广东、福建、广西、昆明的归国华侨、华侨眷属和归国华侨学生，这几天纷纷举行集会。他们表示坚决拥护陈毅外交部长代表我国政府提出的关于全面解决印度尼西亚华侨问题的三点建议，对印度尼西亚反动势力进行的疯狂的反华排华活动表示严重抗议，并且热烈欢迎那些横遭迫害无法在印度尼西亚继续居住的侨胞回国参加建设。
    广东省广州、汕头、海口、潮安、惠州等市、县的归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生都举行了集会。许多印度尼西亚归侨12日在广州市举行的集会上谴责了印度尼西亚的排华活动。张维新说，他有一位亲戚刚从印度尼西亚回国，他对这位亲戚讲述的印度尼西亚排华分子在农村的暴行感到非常愤慨。他坚决要求印度尼西亚当局立即停止排华暴行。正在汕头市参加汕头专区农业、财贸先进集体、先进生产者代表大会的三百多位归侨、侨眷，集会通过了一项决议，拥护陈毅外交部长提出的通过谈判全盘解决华侨问题的三点建议，抗议在印度尼西亚掀起的排华活动，坚决要求印度尼西亚政府尊重和保障华侨的正当权利和利益，立刻停止一切排华行动。在海口市归侨、侨眷12日举行的集会上，侨眷梁月美说，她家全家十多口人仍在印度尼西亚，她万分关切自己亲人的命运。她说，陈毅外交部长的信件代表了广大华侨的心声，我们非常感激政府坚决维护华侨的正当权利和利益。全国最大的国营华侨农场——海南岛兴隆农场场长詹力之说，我国政府一贯深切关怀国外侨胞。兴隆农场就是国家专为安置归国华侨而设立的。最近回国到农场参加建设的一批印度尼西亚归侨，都已得到妥善安置，生产积极，生活愉快。他说，农场的全体场员热烈欢迎流离失所和不愿继续在印度尼西亚居留的华侨回到祖国来，和我们一起建设农场、建设家乡。
    在福州市归侨举行的集会上，福州侨联副主席、印度尼西亚归侨叶鸿宝说，一直和印度尼西亚人民友好相处的华侨，今天却被当作敌对国家的侨民那样受到极其粗暴的待遇，许多侨胞陷入流离失所、生活无着的苦境。印度尼西亚野蛮无理地迫害华侨的行动，破坏了中国和印度尼西亚的传统友谊，而使帝国主义者拍手称快，印度尼西亚的公正人士和广大人民也会感到不安和不满意的。著名侨乡厦门、泉州等地的归侨、侨眷也举行了集会。厦门市侨联委员、印度尼西亚归侨林克发说，陈毅外交部长所提出的全面解决在印度尼西亚的华侨问题的三点建议，完全符合两国人民的根本利益和华侨的愿望，再一次体现了祖国对华侨的亲切关怀，一定会得到广大侨胞的衷心拥护。
    广西僮族自治区南宁市各机关、团体的归侨在12日举行了集会，广西僮族自治区侨联副主席黎汉威在会上对印度尼西亚的排华活动提出强烈的谴责和抗议。他说，广西几年来已经安置了一万多名归侨，他们安居乐业，生活越过越好。我们热烈伸开双手，欢迎流离失所或不愿继续在印度尼西亚居住的华侨回国参加建设。在广西大学工作的印度尼西亚归侨余万达说，他的一家人现在仍在印度尼西亚受苦受难，哥哥经营小生意，一向安分守法，也遭受着迫害。可是，在印度尼西亚的西方垄断资本反而未被触动一根毫毛。这正是中了帝国主义的圈套。南宁、桂林、梧州等地各大中学校的归国华侨学生也纷纷举行集会或给报社写信，表示完全拥护陈毅外交部长的信件。
    昆明市归侨12日也举行了集会。黄捷发代表三十二名在昆明医学院学习的归国华侨同学讲话时说，我们全体同学坚决反对印度尼西亚的排华活动，我们要求印度尼西亚政府接受中国政府提出的三点建议，双方举行谈判全面解决存在于两国之间的华侨问题。
