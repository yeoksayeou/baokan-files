Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 11th: Just after the golden late rice was harvested on Hainan Island, the lush early rice seedlings are now turning the fields green again.

This winter, the work of sowing and cultivating early rice seedlings on Hainan Island started one or two seasons earlier than in previous years. According to incomplete statistics as of December 4th, the island has already sown seeds in more than 143,300 mu of seedling fields, sowing more than 13 million jin of rice seeds, accounting for 25% of the region's sowing plan. The seedling cultivation area has increased two-fold compared to the same period in 1957, and more than doubled compared to the same period in 1958.

The early rice sowing and seedling cultivation work in various regions started early in response to the call of the Hainan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to "strive to basically complete the transplanting of seedlings before the Spring Festival."

Wanning and Qionghai counties in the east, which completed rice transplanting before the Spring Festival in previous years, have been doing an even earlier job of seedling cultivation this winter. Now, they have completed more than 70% of the sowing and seedling cultivation plan.

Qiongzhong and Ledong counties in minority areas used to cultivate seedlings relatively late in previous years, but this year they have also started earlier. Qiongzhong County has sown more than 500,000 jin of seeds, and Ledong County has already sown more than 600,000 jin. In order to make the seedlings grow strong, various regions are sowing seeds and managing them simultaneously, applying fertilizer and irrigating in a timely manner, and conscientiously doing a good job in cold protection.

    海南岛早稻秧苗绿满田
    各地农民争取春节前插完秧
    新华社广州11日电　海南岛刚刚收割完金黄色的晚稻，现在茁壮的早稻秧苗又染绿了田野。
    海南岛各地今冬早稻播种育秧工作比往年提早了一、二个季节。截至本月4日止的不完全统计，全岛落谷的秧田已达十四万三千三百多亩，播下谷种一千三百多万斤，占全区播种计划的25％。育秧面积比1957年同期增加了二倍，比1958年同期也增加了一倍以上。
    各地早稻播种育秧工作，是响应中共海南区党委提出的“力争春节前基本插完秧”的号召，提前开始的。
    往年在春节前就插完秧的东部万宁、琼海等县，今冬育秧工作搞得更早，现在，已经完成播种育秧计划70％以上。
    少数民族地区的琼中、乐东等县往年育秧比较迟，今年也抓得比较早，琼中县播下种子五十多万斤，乐东县已经播下六十多万斤。为使秧苗生长粗壮，各地边落谷、边管理，及时追肥、灌水，认真做好防寒工作。
