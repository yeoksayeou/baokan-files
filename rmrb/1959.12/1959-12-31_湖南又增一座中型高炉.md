Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 29th December. The No. 3 blast furnace of the Lianyuan Iron and Steel Plant in Hunan Province has recently been completed. After this blast furnace, with a volume of 255 cubic meters, is put into production, it can produce 100,000 tons of iron annually.

The workers of the Second Engineering Office of the Hunan Provincial Metallurgical Bureau Construction Company, who were responsible for the construction of the blast furnace, overcame many difficulties in manpower, equipment, materials, and transportation during the construction process in order to speed up the construction progress and strive to produce iron as soon as possible. The crane operators, with only one derrick crane, used various combined local and foreign crane methods to complete the lifting of more than 400 tons of metal components on schedule and with guaranteed quality. The workers of the furnace building team made great technical innovations, increasing the bricklaying from two shifts laying one layer of bricks to one shift laying seven layers of bricks, which made the construction progress rise sharply. Therefore, it only took 52 days to complete the entire project of the blast furnace, 18 days ahead of the original plan, and the project quality met the design requirements.

　　湖南又增一座中型高炉
    新华社长沙29日电　湖南省涟源钢铁厂三号高炉在最近建成。这座容积为二百五十五立方米的高炉投入生产后，每年可产生铁十万吨。
    担负高炉施工任务的湖南省冶金局建筑公司第二工程处职工，为了加快建设进度，争取早日出铁，在施工过程中战胜了人力、设备、材料和运输等方面的许多困难。起重工在只有一台吊杆设备的条件下，运用各种土洋结合的吊装法，如期如质地完成了四百多吨金属构件的吊装任务。筑炉组的工人大闹技术革新，由开始两班砌一层砖提高到一班砌七层砖，使施工进度直线上升，因此只用了五十二天时间就完成了高炉的全部工程，工期比原计划提前十八天，工程质量达到了设计要求。
