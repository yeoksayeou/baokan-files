　　Celebrating the New Year
　　Fu Shi
　　Today, all along the way, clang, clang, dong, dong,
　　Firecracker paper scraps are scattered all over the streets,
　　Children walking by suddenly seem taller,
　　Old people walking by become like children.

　　The streets and alleys are crowded with people,
　　Exchanging joy, smiles flying high,
　　Colorful and bright, all suffused with red,
　　Excitement on faces reveals even more ease.

　　Surely some factory has won another victory,
　　Or some store has become a hero…
　　Why are there no congratulations at the door?
　　Why are there no red flowers worn on chests?

　　Looking around, the spring scenery is harmonious,
　　Who would believe that celebrating the New Year is brought forward to late winter,
　　Being used to seeing every door decorated with colors,
　　Why does it feel different today!?

　　Eyes search for golden-lettered flower sheds,
　　"Hello, comrade," new additions of praise:
　　"Entering 1960 ahead of schedule!"
　　The colorful archway brings boundless joy.

　　跨年欢
　　俯拾
　　今天一路锵锵咚咚，
　　爆仗花纸洒满街中，
　　儿童走过忽然高大，
　　老人走过变成儿童。
　　大街小巷人群挤拥，
　　交送欢乐飞扬笑容，
　　五彩缤纷一漫红透，
　　兴奋脸上越见轻松。
　　定是谁厂又打胜仗，
　　又是谁店争到英雄，……
　　为啥不见贺喜上门？
　　为啥不见红花戴胸？
　　举目四望春色融融，
　　谁信过年提在前冬，
　　满门结彩已经看惯，
　　今天感觉为何不同！？
　　眼睛搜索金字花棚，
    “同志您好”新添歌颂：
　　“提前跨进1960”！
　　彩门接来喜气重重。
