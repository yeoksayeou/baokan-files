The Muleng Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province is vigorously engaged in technological innovation and revolution, and has successively created and promoted more than forty kinds of innovative tools, basically realizing mechanized and semi-mechanized production.

In the past, the bureau transported timber, with a portion being sent by small rivers and motor vehicles, but the vast majority relied on cattle and horse harnesses for transport. This year, the state plan increased by 50.54% compared to last year. From the beginning of the year, a contradiction arose where production capacity could not meet production needs. To this end, the Bureau's Party Committee decided to launch a large-scale technological innovation and revolution movement. In less than a month, the whole bureau saw the emergence of more than twenty new timber skidding tools, such as the monorail wooden wheel timber skidding device, the triangular timber skidding device, and the light automatic return timber skidding vehicle. The proportion of timber skidded using the new tools immediately reached over 70%. Subsequently, they successfully created twenty or thirty kinds of new tools such as monorail concentrators, cableway log aligners, non-powered automatic unloading devices, pole erecting machines, and wooden cranes, enabling mechanization and semi-mechanization of processes such as loading and unloading.

In more than ten months, the broad masses of workers at this forestry bureau put forward approximately 20,000 rationalization proposals and created more than sixty new tools. After appraisal, forty-four new tools have been finalized for promotion. As a result, the bureau's production has transitioned from the original handicraft-based seasonal operation to mechanized and semi-mechanized year-round production. At present, the proportion of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the bureau's timber skidding process has reached 92%. During this year's winter transport in the nine logging yards, except for five logging yards where a small number of horse harnesses were needed to pull down some timber left over from past forest management, the other four logging yards have completely eliminated the use of cattle and horse harnesses.

Due to the vigorous technological innovation in this forestry bureau, it overfulfilled the annual timber production task of 400,000 cubic meters by more than 8,700 cubic meters as early as the end of September. The output of raw timber increased by 71.1% compared to the same period last year, the labor productivity increased by 13.1% compared to this year's plan, and the comprehensive cost of producing each cubic meter of timber decreased by 1.03 yuan compared to this year's plan and by 4.25 yuan compared to last year.

    集材不用马套子
    穆棱林业局制成四十多种革新工具
    黑龙江穆棱林业局大搞技术革新和技术革命，先后创造和推广了四十多种革新工具，基本实现了机械化、半机械化生产。
    这个局过去集运木材，除了一部分由小河流送和汽车运送以外，绝大部分都是靠牛马套子运搬。今年国家计划又比去年提高50.54％。从年初一开始就出现了生产能力满足不了生产需要的矛盾。为此，局党委决定开展一个声势浩大的技术革新和技术革命运动。不到一个月的时间，全局就出现了单轨木轮集材器、三角木集材器、轻便自动回空集材车等二十多种集材新工具。新工具集材比重当即达到了70％以上。接着又创造成功了单轨集中器、索道归楞器、无动力自动卸车器、架杆归楞机、木制起重机等二、三十种新工具，使装卸车等工序实现了机械化、半机械化。
    在十个多月中，这个林业局广大职工就提出了合理化建议约两万件，创造新工具六十余种。经过鉴定，有四十四种新工具已经定型推广。全局的生产因此由原来的手工业的季节性作业，过渡到了机械化、半机械化的常年生产。现在，这个局集材工序上的机械化、半机械化比重达到了92％。今年在九个采伐林场的冬运中，除有五个林场因过去营林遗留下一部分木材需用少数马套子拉下来以外，其他四个林场已经全部取消了牛马套子。
    这个林业局由于大闹技术革新，早在9月底就超额八千七百多立方米完成了全年四十万立方米的木材生产任务，原木产量比去年同期提高了71.1％，劳动生产率比今年的计划提高了13.1％，生产每立方米木材的综合成本比今年计划降低了一点零三元，比去年降低了四点二五元。
