　　Combining Mountain and River Management with Large-Scale Afforestation
    Massively Creating Timber Forests and Oil Forests is the Characteristic of This Winter's Afforestation

    This newspaper reports that a large-scale winter afforestation campaign has been launched across the country.

    The scale of this winter's afforestation is larger than in previous years. By late November, 26 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country had successively launched winter afforestation. Gansu Province took the lead in the campaign. As of December 1st, it had exceeded the second half's afforestation plan by 60.9%. Henan Province also caught up rapidly, exceeding the winter afforestation plan by more than double by the end of November. Currently, the province is launching a massive second wave of afforestation.

    In carrying out winter afforestation, various regions generally combine afforestation with water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation. Hubei Province combines afforestation with the province's "mountain management, water management, and soil management" campaign. Many areas have put forward the slogan "Where water conservancy is built, forests will be planted." Gansu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, and other provinces are currently also carrying out afforestation and protecting young forests in conjunction with water conservancy and soil and water conservation.

    Paying attention to creating timber forests and oil forests is another characteristic of this winter's afforestation, and some regions have already begun to establish timber forest and oil forest bases. In winter afforestation, Henan Province implemented the principle of focusing on timber forests and combining timber forests with economic forests. Tangshan, Yi County, Zhengding, and other places in Hebei Province have prominently focused on mine pillar forests. In Zhangjiakou City, among the 1.02 million mu of afforestation completed, 190,000 mu were mine pillar forests. Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, and other provinces have also planted a large number of walnut forests. In addition to establishing timber forest bases, many southern provinces and regions are actively expanding and establishing oil forest bases.

    In order to ensure and improve the quality of afforestation, various regions have made full preparations in advance in terms of forest land planning, seedling preparation, and technical training. Various regions have also adopted various technical measures and organizational measures, thus greatly improving the quality of afforestation. According to preliminary inspections in Shaanxi Province, more than 95% of the newly afforested areas meet quality requirements. (Attached picture)

### 结合治山治水大规模造林  大量营造用材林和油料林是今冬造林的特色

　　结合治山治水大规模造林
    大量营造用材林和油料林是今冬造林的特色
    本报讯　大规模的冬季造林运动已经在全国开展起来了。
    今年冬季造林的规模比往年大，到11月下旬，全国二十六个省、区、市都先后开展了冬季造林。甘肃省在运动中一马当先，到12月1日止，已经超过下半年造林计划60.9％。河南省也急起直追，到11月底超过冬季造林计划一倍以上，目前全省又掀起声势浩大的第二次造林高潮。
    各地在开展冬季造林中，一般都把造林与兴修水利、水土保持等工作结合起来。湖北省结合全省的“治山、治水、治土”运动植树造林，许多地区提出了“水利修到哪里，林就造到哪里”的口号。甘肃、山西、陕西、山东等省目前也都在结合水利和水土保持进行植树造林和保护幼林。
    注意营造用材林和油料林，是今冬造林的另一个特点，并且有些地区已经开始建立用材林和油料林基地。河南省在冬季造林中贯彻了以用材林为主、用材林和经济林并举的方针。河北唐山、易县、正定等地都突出地抓了矿柱林，张家口市在完成的一百零二万亩造林中，就有十九万亩矿柱林。山西、陕西、河北等省还种植了大量的核桃林。南方许多省区除了建立用材林基地以外，还在积极扩大和建立油料林基地。
    为了保证提高造林质量，各地在林地规划、种苗准备、技术力量的培训等方面事先都作了充分准备，各地又采取了各种技术措施和组织措施，因而造林质量大大提高。陕西省经过初步检查，新造林95％以上都合乎质量要求。（附图片）
