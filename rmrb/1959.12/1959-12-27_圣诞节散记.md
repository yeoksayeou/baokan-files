　　Christmas Jottings
　　By our correspondent Su Lan
    "Happy Christmas!" The British greet each other in this way, welcoming this most important traditional festival.
    As early as a month ago, from the day the splendid colored lights were hung on the streets of West London, people became busy. Shop owners ingeniously decorated their windows, employing every charm to attract customers. "British European Airways" added a thousand flights in two weeks, sending wealthy people who were tired of living in London, along with their wives and Pekingese dogs, to foreign countries for vacation. Young girls who worship the American lifestyle painted portraits on their knees—perhaps of their lovers, or perhaps of singing stars of vulgar songs. Those helpless and lonely old people still huddled in their cold little houses, quietly waiting for the end of their lives. Beggars, as usual, held a tattered hat, standing at the door of shops full of turkeys, hoping that kind-hearted people would generously give alms. As for those innocent children, with shyness and excitement, they shook hands with Santa Claus. At this time, Santa Claus would tell him: "On Christmas Eve, hang your socks on the head of your bed, and sleep sweetly. When you open your little eyes, you will find the Christmas gifts you are expecting…."
    In the home of electrician Manning, some colorful paper strips hung on the ceiling. This brought a little festive atmosphere to his family. Manning said: "The rich celebrate Christmas almost every day. For the poor, it's only once a year."
    The wages earned by Mr. and Mrs. Manning can only barely support themselves and their six children. In this cold and foggy winter, the children have no coats. This family has to pay fifteen shillings a week in installment debts. Now, Christmas is coming, and old traditions and customs force them to spend some money for this once-a-year festival. They purchased some Christmas gifts for the children on credit through installment payments. And on the Christmas dinner table, although they can't see a fat and tender turkey, they must at least prepare some chicken and pudding. This year, Manning's wife exceptionally bought her husband a cigar. Manning said humorously: "When I smoke this cigar, I feel like I have suddenly become a rich man." However, as the cigar went out, he immediately thought that the debt owed to the shop owner had increased from fifteen shillings to thirty shillings per week. How to earn an extra fifteen shillings each week? This is the most distressing problem at the moment.
    Anyway, Manning is lucky to have a job, which is fortunate. Just a few days before Christmas, a biscuit factory laid off 290 workers. Christmas brought them not joy, but endless sorrow and grief.
    Those lonely and destitute elderly people who live on pensions have another kind of feeling when they celebrate Christmas. Seventy-year-old Mr. and Mrs. Dostun had been saving two shillings a week from their meager income months ago. On Christmas Eve, this "deposit" was exchanged for a bottle of wine and two pounds of beef. Mr. Dostun's only two sons died in the last war. These two old people spent another festive night in silent mourning.
    Another old couple living across the street from the Dostuns, the Taylors, had an even more desolate Christmas. Taylor is under sixty-five years old and does not qualify for a pension. He lives on a pitifully small amount of pension, which is the reward for his bloodshed in the First World War. He cannot afford any festive gifts, even the most ordinary, such as a steak. He and his chronically ill wife, like field mice, curled up in their home—this home has no electric lights for illumination, no heating charcoal in the stove, and the moldy and damp walls are constantly peeling off the lime…. Christmas, for him, is as bleak, indifferent, and dim as any other day of the year.
    Six participants in the peace movement spent Christmas in a London prison. They were arrested a few months ago for distributing leaflets against nuclear war preparations. Some mass organizations requested their release before Christmas so they could reunite with their families. This request was rejected by the government.
    For those fat and bloated gentlemen, Christmas is truly "icing on the cake." The thirty-eight gentlemen of the City of London held a grand celebration feast on Christmas Eve, spending five hundred pounds for one meal. The "Daily Express" described in detail how these gentlemen in evening gowns savored smoked salmon and various delicacies, drinking champagne and whiskey.
    It is truly "when a man attains the Tao, all his pets ascend to heaven." The rich people's livestock also enjoyed the joy of Christmas. The "British Animal Lovers Club" specially held a banquet for livestock. Participants included donkeys, horses, sheep, dogs, and cats. They gnawed on specially made cakes and pastries. There was a column article in the newspaper instructing people how to give Christmas gifts to livestock. It wrote: "I certainly think they have the right to receive gifts. For dogs, a high-quality, sturdy bone in a Christmas stocking or wrapped in paper would be an excellent gift (note: this is not an ordinary meat bone, but a dog biscuit made of flour, gravy, and vitamins in the shape of a bone), and it will get the greatest pleasure. Try giving your cat a can of fish…. Open a very narrow opening in the can. The important thing to remember is that they should be allowed to open the gifts themselves.”
    "What right do you have to be happy? What reason do you have to be happy? You are poor enough!" "What right do you have to be unhappy? What reason do you have to be unhappy? You are rich enough!" This situation described by the great British writer Dickens in "A Christmas Carol" has not changed today, a hundred years later.

### 圣诞节散记

　　圣诞节散记
　　本报记者　苏蓝
    “祝你圣诞节愉快！”英国人彼此这样祝福着，来迎接这个最隆重的传统节日。
    早在一个月以前，从西伦敦的大街上挂起华丽的彩灯那一天起，人们就忙碌起来了，商店的老板们出奇制胜地布置橱窗，运用了吸引顾客的一切魅力。“英国欧洲航空公司”在两个星期中增加了一千架次客机，把在伦敦住腻了的富翁，连同他的妻子和哈巴狗，送到国外去度假。崇拜美国生活方式的少女，在膝盖上画着人头像——画的或许是自己的情人，或许是唱黄色歌曲的明星。那些无依无靠的老年人，仍然缩在自己寒冷的小屋中，静静地等待着生命的结束。乞丐照例捧着一顶破帽子，站在挂满火鸡的商店门口，盼望着好心肠的人能慷慨地给予施舍。至于那些天真无邪的孩子们，怀着羞怯和兴奋的心情，和圣诞老人握手。这时，圣诞老人会告诉他：“圣诞节前夜，把你的袜子吊在床头上，香香甜甜地睡上一觉。当你睁开小眼睛时，就会发现你所期待的圣诞礼品……。”
    在电气工人曼宁的家里，一些五颜六色的纸条悬在天花板上。这给他的家庭带来了一点节日的气氛。曼宁说：“富人们几乎每天都在过圣诞节。对穷人来说，一年也只不过这么一次。”
    曼宁夫妇所挣的工资，只能勉强养活自己和六个孩子。在这样寒冷多雾的冬季，孩子们都没有大衣。这个家庭每星期要付十五个先令的分期付款的债务。现在，圣诞节来临了，旧的传统和习俗，迫使他们不能不为这一年一度的节日花一些钱。他们以分期付款的办法，为孩子们赊购了一些圣诞礼品。而在圣诞节的晚餐桌上，虽然见不到又肥又嫩的火鸡，至少也得准备一点鸡肉和布丁。今年，曼宁的妻子破例地替丈夫买了一支雪茄。曼宁幽默地说：“当我抽着这支雪茄的时候，我觉得自己忽然变成了富人。”但是，随着雪茄的熄灭，他马上想到的是，欠商店老板的债已从每星期十五先令增加到三十先令。每星期怎样多挣上十五个先令？这是当前最苦恼的问题。
    不管怎样，曼宁毕竟有工可做，算得上幸运。就在圣诞节的前几天，饼干工厂解雇了二百九十个工人。圣诞节给他们带来的不是欢乐，而是无限的忧愁和悲怆。
    那些孤苦零仃、靠养老金生活的老年人，在过圣诞节时又是另外一种心情。七十岁的多士顿和他的妻子，早在几个月前，就从极少的收入中，每星期储蓄两个先令。到了圣诞节前夕，这笔“存款”换回来一瓶葡萄酒和两磅牛肉。多士顿仅有的两个儿子，都死于上次战争中，这两个老人，在默默的悼念中度过了又一个节日的夜晚。
    住在多士顿对门的另一对老人——泰勒夫妇，过着更加凄凉的圣诞节。泰勒不满六十五岁，没有资格领养老金。他靠着少得可怜的一点儿抚恤金过日子，那是他在第一次世界大战中流过血的报酬。他买不起任何节日的礼品，即使是最普通的，比如说一块牛排。他和自己的常年有病的妻子，像田鼠一样，卷缩在自己的家里——这个家没有安装照明用的电灯，炉子里没有取暖的炭火，发霉和潮湿的墙壁不断地脱落着石灰……。圣诞节对他来说，同一年中其他的日子一样凄楚冷漠，暗淡无光。
    六个和平运动的参加者，在伦敦的监狱中度过了圣诞节。几个月前他们因为散发反对核子备战的传单被捕。一些群众组织要求在圣诞节前释放他们，好同家人团圆。这个要求被政府拒绝了。
    对于那些脑满肠肥的绅士们来说，圣诞节真是“锦上添花”。伦敦城的三十八个绅士，在圣诞节前夕大摆庆祝筵席，一席饭花了五百英镑。“每日快报”不厌其详地描述这些穿着晚礼服的绅士，如何津津有味地嚼着熏鲑鱼和各色大菜，喝着香槟和威士忌。
    真是“一人得道，鸡犬升天”，富人们的牲畜也享受一番圣诞节的欢乐。“英国爱兽俱乐部”专门为牲畜举行了一个宴会。参加者有驴、马、羊、狗、猫。它们啃着特制的蛋糕和点心。在报纸上有一篇专栏文章，指导人们怎样给牲畜送圣诞节礼品。它写道：“我当然认为它们有权利得到礼物。对于狗来说，装在圣诞袜子里的、或用纸包装起来的一根上等、结实的骨头，会是非常出色的礼品（按：这不是普通的肉骨头，而是用面粉、肉汁和维他命制成的像骨头模样的狗饼干），它将得到最大的快乐。试一试给你的猫一筒鱼罐头……。罐头开个很窄的口子。要记住的是，应该让它们自己去打开礼品。”
    “你有什么权利可以快活？你有什么理由可以快活？你够穷啦！”“你有什么权利可以不快活？你有什么理由可以不开心？你够富啦！”英国大文豪狄更斯在“圣诞欢歌”一书中描述的这种情况，在一百年后的今天，并没有改变。
