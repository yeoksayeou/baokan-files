Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Electric Dispatch: This reporter reports: Northern Vietnam has achieved a bumper autumn rice harvest this year. According to preliminary statistics, production is expected to increase by about 8% compared to last year's bumper autumn rice harvest. The average yield of autumn rice per hectare in North Vietnam is about 2.6 tons, which is twice as high as the average yield per hectare in South Vietnam.

Currently, most areas in the North have completed harvesting, with nearly a quarter of the rice fields in Ninh Binh, Hai Duong, and Kien An provinces still being harvested. Such a large harvest was achieved by farmers in various regions under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government through deep plowing, careful cultivation, and overcoming natural disasters.

Two gratifying phenomena have emerged in this year's autumn rice harvest: (1) The average yield per unit area of autumn rice in mountainous areas has caught up with that of the plains. Among them, the average yield per unit area in the Tai-Meo Autonomous Region is about 3.2 tons per hectare, while before the war and in the early days of liberation, the yield of rice in mountainous areas was only about one ton per hectare. (2) The unit area yield of early-maturing rice in autumn has greatly increased, increasing by more than 20% compared to last year.

There are many wastelands in the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam that can be reclaimed; at the same time, there is great potential for planting early-maturing rice after harvesting a large number of fields planted with cash crops. Therefore, the emergence of bumper harvests in mountainous areas and high yields of early-maturing rice has tapped new potential for the continued development of agriculture in North Vietnam in the future.

Northern Vietnam suffered severe drought and flood disasters this year. Generally speaking, the situation was that the north was flooded and the south was dry, with some provinces in the delta experiencing both floods and droughts. In the struggle against natural disasters, the farmers showed tenacious will. Some places were submerged and replanted three times, finally ensuring a bumper harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Electric Dispatch According to reports in the newspapers here on the 28th, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party issued instructions to party committees at all levels on the 26th, saying that from now until the end of this year, the primary central task of the rural areas of North Vietnam should be to consolidate the mutual aid and cooperation movement and vigorously promote winter-spring production.

The instructions said that there are currently more than 22,000 agricultural cooperatives in North Vietnam (accounting for 40% of the total number of farm households). Appropriate centralized leadership by party committees at all levels over agricultural cooperatives is an extremely important condition for ensuring a complete victory in winter-spring production.

The instructions called on party committees at all levels to do a good job in ideological work, mobilize the people of the whole country to strengthen their determination, and strive to achieve a comprehensive, high-yield, and substantive bumper harvest in winter and spring. (Attached picture)

    实行深耕细作战胜严重灾害
    越南北方秋稻大丰收
    劳动党号召巩固合作运动争取冬春全面丰产
    据新华社河内电　本社记者报道：越南北方今年秋稻大丰收。据初步统计，产量预期将比去年秋稻大丰收产量，再增加
  8％左右。全北越秋稻平均每公顷产量约为二点六吨，比南越的平均每公顷产量高一倍。
    目前，北方大部分地区已经收割完毕，还有宁平、海阳、建安三省近四分之一的稻田尚在收割中。这样大的丰收是各地农民在越南劳动党和政府领导下深耕细作、战胜自然灾害而后取得的。
    今年秋稻丰产出现了两个可喜的现象：（一）山区的秋稻平均单位面积产量赶上了平原地区，其中傣苗自治区平均单位面积产量是每公顷三点二吨左右，而战前和解放初期，山区水稻每公顷产量只有一吨左右。（二）秋稻的早熟稻单位面积产量大大提高，比去年增加20％以上。
    越南北方山区有很多荒地可以开垦；同时，种植经济作物的大量田地在收割后再种植早熟稻也大有发展余地。因此，山区丰产和早熟稻高产局面的出现，为今后北越农业继续大发展发掘了新的潜力。
    越南北方今年曾遭到严重的旱涝灾害，以宁平省为界，一般情况是北涝南旱，而三角洲一部分省份是又涝又旱。农民们在抵抗天灾的斗争中，表现了顽强的意志，有的地方三淹三种，终于保证了丰收。
    据新华社河内电　据这里报纸28日报道，越南劳动党中央委员会26日向各级党委发出指示说，从现在起到今年年底，越南北方农村应以巩固变工合作运动和大力推进冬春生产为首要中心任务。
    指示说，目前越南北方已有两万两千多个农业社（占农户总数的40％）。各级党委对农业社适当集中领导，是保证冬春生产全胜的极其重要的条件。
    指示要求各级党委作好思想工作，动员全国人民加强决心，为实现冬春全面、高额、落实的丰产而奋斗。（附图片）
