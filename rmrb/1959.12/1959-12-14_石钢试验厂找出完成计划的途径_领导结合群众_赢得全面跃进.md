Xinhua News Agency, December 13th -- Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Xu Bingzhong reports: The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's Experiment Factory, which was considered by some in August to be unable to complete the state plan, due to leading cadres going deep into production teams to work alongside the workers, and leading workers and technicians to find a series of ways to increase production, completed the annual state steel production plan twenty-five days ahead of schedule, and the qualified rate of steel exceeded the state plan by 0.27%. In November, the cost of steel was reduced by 12.07% compared with the first half of the year, and labor productivity increased by 87.7% compared with January. No major accidents have occurred in the past ten months.

This factory was built in a rush in fourteen days during the Great Leap Forward last year. After its completion, although the level of production continued to increase, it was not stable enough. By August this year, it had only completed half of the annual plan. To complete the annual plan, the daily output in the fourth quarter had to be increased by another 53%. Therefore, whether a substantial leap forward could be achieved and the plan completed satisfactorily became the most prominent issue for the entire factory.

In order to further find ways to increase production, the factory's leading cadres and technicians went to each production team and worked alongside the workers, both steelmaking and comparing with the advanced records that had appeared before, conducting realistic writing, identification, and analysis. A total of 648 furnaces of steel production were analyzed, and from the first process to the last process, careful research and calculation were carried out to find factors that could increase production and key technical issues. Finally, it was found that increasing furnace life was an important way to increase output. Through the analysis of the entire production process, it was also found that overcharging molten iron was a major reason hindering the increase of furnace life; however, if less molten iron was charged, the output could not be increased to the level required by the plan. In order to clarify this problem, the factory party committee organized technicians to observe and record the charging of molten iron alongside the workers, and conducted experiments at the same time. During the experiment, they found that under the condition of charging the same amount of molten iron, the furnace without an enlarged furnace chamber caused deep blowing due to the high liquid level of the molten iron, causing the wind eye to be damaged prematurely; while a furnace with a furnace chamber enlarged by 0.08 cubic meters, although the furnace wall was thinned, but because the enlarged furnace chamber facilitated the adoption of the blowing method of first the surface and then the depth, the furnace life was increased instead. This broke the concerns of some people that the enlargement of the furnace chamber would reduce the furnace life, and the conclusion was reached that the furnace chamber must be enlarged.

After a series of research and analysis, the factory party committee finally systematically proposed four key points for improving the level of production: increasing furnace life and increasing the number of blowing furnaces; expanding the furnace chamber volume, charging more molten iron, and increasing the output of each furnace of steel; eliminating the air leakage of the converter wind box and shortening the smelting time; and improving quality and reducing defective products. According to precise calculations, if these four key issues can be effectively solved, the daily output of steel can be increased by 64.4%, exceeding the level of the state plan.

After the party committee put forward the four key points, the workers immediately conducted experiments on a three-ton furnace, and took a series of measures around these four key issues. As a result, the blowing time of each furnace of steel was shortened by three minutes, the furnace life was increased by 18 furnaces, and the output of each furnace of steel also increased by 10%. This achievement greatly encouraged the workers, and many new operating methods were quickly promoted throughout the factory, and the output of steel increased rapidly. In the three months after August, the production situation of the entire factory has undergone fundamental changes. Now the average daily output of steel is more than double that of early August, and the steel produced in the past three months is equal to the total output of the past eight months, exceeding the requirements of the state plan. In November, the utilization coefficient of the factory's fixed converter reached 25, and the utilization coefficient of the detachable converter reached 30, both of which jumped to the national advanced level.

    石钢试验厂找出完成计划的途径
    领导结合群众　赢得全面跃进
    据新华社13日讯　新华社特约记者徐炳忠报道：今年8月间还被一些人认为将完不成国家计划的石景山钢铁公司试验厂，由于领导干部深入班组跟班劳动，领导工人、技术人员找到了一系列增产的途径，结果钢产量提前二十五天完成全年国家计划，钢的合格率超过国家计划0.27％。11月份，钢的成本比上半年降低12.07％，劳动生产率比1月份提高87.7％。十个多月来没有发生重大事故。
    这个厂是在去年大跃进中以十四天时间突击建成的。在建成以后，生产水平虽然不断提高，但是不够稳定。今年到8月份还只完成全年计划的一半，要完成全年的计划，必须把第四季度的日产量再提高53％。因此，能不能实现大幅度跃进，圆满完成计划，就成了全厂一个最突出的问题。
    为了进一步寻找增产途径，工厂的领导干部、技术人员到各生产班组，和工人们一起一面炼钢，一面对照以前出现过的先进纪录，进行写实、鉴定和分析，先后共分析了六百四十八炉钢的生产情况，并且从最初一道工序到最末一道工序，都逐个进行认真的研究和计算，查找可以增产的因素及其关键技术问题，最后找到了提高炉龄是增加产量的一个重要方法。通过对全部生产过程的分析，又发现过多装入铁水是妨碍炉龄提高的一个主要原因；但是如果不多装铁水，就不能把产量提高到计划要求的水平。为了把这个问题弄清楚，工厂党委又组织技术人员对装入铁水进行跟班观察和记录，同时进行试验。在试验过程中，他们发现在装同样多铁水的条件下，没有扩大炉膛的炉子由于铁水液面较高，造成深吹，使风眼过早损坏；而一个炉膛扩大了零点零八立方米的炉子，虽然炉壁减薄，但由于炉膛扩大后便于采取先面后深的吹炼方法，炉龄反而提高，这样就打破了一部分人认为炉膛扩大会使炉龄降低的顾虑，得出了必须扩大炉膛的结论。
    经过一系列的研究分析，工厂党委最后系统地提出提高生产水平的四大关键：提高炉龄，增加吹炼炉数；扩大炉膛容积，多装铁水，提高每炉钢产量；消灭转炉风箱跑风现象，缩短冶炼时间；提高质量，减少废品。据精细计算，如果有效地解决这四大关键问题，就能使钢的日产量提高64.4％，超过国家计划的水平。
    在党委提出四大关键以后，职工们立即在一个三吨炉子上作试验，围绕这四大关键问题采取了一系列措施，结果，每炉钢的吹炼时间缩短了三分钟，炉龄提高了十八炉，每炉钢的产量还增长了10％。这一成果大大鼓舞了职工群众，许多新的操作方法很快在全厂推广，钢的产量迅速上升。在8月以后的三个多月中，全厂生产局面发生了根本的变化，现在钢的平均日产量比8月上旬翻了一番多，三个多月来生产的钢等于过去八个月产量的总和，超过了国家计划的要求。11月份这个厂的固定式转炉利用系数达到二十五，可拆式转炉利用系数达到三十，都跃居全国先进水平。（附图片）
