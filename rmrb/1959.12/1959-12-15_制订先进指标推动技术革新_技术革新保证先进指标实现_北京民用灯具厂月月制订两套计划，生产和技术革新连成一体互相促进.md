    Setting Advanced Targets to Promote Technological Innovation; Technological Innovation Guarantees the Achievement of Advanced Targets.
    Beijing Civilian Lamp Factory Formulates Two Sets of Plans Every Month, Integrating Production and Technological Innovation to Promote Each Other
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Hong Helin reports: The Beijing Civilian Lamp Factory, which constantly uses advanced targets to challenge itself in production, considers the subjective initiative of the workers and the infinite potential of technological revolution every month. Based on needs and possibilities, it proposes a production leap forward plan that exceeds the state plan by 20% to 30%. At the same time, it mobilizes the masses to discuss and formulate corresponding technological innovation plans. These two sets of plans are integrated and promote each other, using high-speed leap forward production targets to drive technological revolution, and using continuous and in-depth mass technological innovation and technological revolution to ensure production leaps forward at a high speed, continuously, and comprehensively. The total output value for the first eleven months of this year has been rising continuously every month, and each month has exceeded the state plan by an average of about 20%. The product qualification rate has increased from 92% last year to 99.6%, with more than ten new varieties added, and costs have decreased by 10%.
    The factory's approach of combining the production leap forward plan with a unified technological innovation plan truly transforms technological innovation and technological revolution into a broad and lasting mass movement, and elevates it to a new stage that is both vigorous and down-to-earth. Before last year, only some employees of the factory proposed technological innovation suggestions, and the number was small, the quality was relatively low, and they were piecemeal, not often combined with key production issues. Since the implementation of this new approach, the factory's production army has been organized into a technological revolution army, and every month, they attack technological "fortresses" in a planned, prepared, and coordinated manner. Since the beginning of this year, the number of employees who frequently make technological innovation suggestions has increased from 30% of the total number of employees last year to 80%, and the number of technological innovation suggestions proposed by the factory has increased by two times compared to last year. Many apprentices who were previously concerned about their low technical level and dared not make suggestions have become pioneers in technological innovation. Through extensive discussions among the masses, many technological innovation suggestions have been enriched, and the technical level of employees has rapidly improved.
    Because the factory unifies the planning of technological innovation projects every month, concentrates the organization of various forces, assigns tasks with deadlines, it ensures the realization of each technological innovation project. This year, the factory's technological innovation projects have been realized more, faster, better, and more economically. The vast majority of technological innovation plans can be completed around the 20th of each month, and most workshops and teams can achieve 100% of their plans, which is very different from the situation in the past where it was difficult to quickly implement technological innovation suggestions. In the second quarter of this year, the factory undertook the task of manufacturing lanterns for more than ten projects, such as the Great Hall of the People. According to the technical conditions at the time, it would require an additional 250 people to complete the work on schedule. The factory immediately convened veteran workers and technicians to conduct research, comprehensively analyze product characteristics, and launched a high tide of technological innovation centered on the mechanization of lantern manufacturing. The suggestion of veteran worker Liu Shuguo to manufacture a "universal rolling machine" was included in the plan, and technicians actively helped with drawings, and fitters and forgers also cooperated with him. One day before the deadline, this "universal rolling machine," which could replace the manual operation of seventy-eight people, was put into production, solving the major problem of rolling more than 200,000 lantern circles. Thanks to the realization of various technological innovations, the factory completed the manufacturing task of more than 19,000 lamps ten days ahead of schedule with guaranteed quality and quantity without adding a single person.
    Now, the workers of this factory call technological innovation the "forerunner" of production. Since the beginning of this year, the whole factory, workshops, and teams have first checked the completion of the technological innovation plan when inspecting production, and publicized it, carried out observation, evaluation, and competition among the masses; if there are problems, they will work together to solve them. Not long ago, when the Third Workshop was trial-producing a straightening machine, the key problem of "the iron wire is not clamped tightly" could not be solved one day before the deadline. The head of the production section immediately went to the workshop and formed a "storming team" with the workshop director and veteran workers, and thought of many ways, working hard for twelve hours, and finally succeeded in the trial production that night, ensuring that the entire workshop achieved the leap forward plan eleven days ahead of schedule.

    制订先进指标推动技术革新  技术革新保证先进指标实现
    北京民用灯具厂月月制订两套计划，生产和技术革新连成一体互相促进
    本报讯　记者洪和临报道：在生产上经常用先进指标要求自己的北京民用灯具厂，每月都考虑到职工群众的主观能动性和技术革命的无穷潜力，根据需要和可能，提出超过国家计划20％至30％的生产跃进计划，同时发动群众讨论制定相应的技术革新计划。这两套计划连成一体，互相促进，用高速跃进的生产指标推动技术革命，用不断深入的群众性技术革新和技术革命保证生产高速、持续、全面地跃进。今年前十一个月的生产总值，月月持续上升，而且每个月平均都比国家计划超额20％左右，产品合格率由去年的92％提高到99.6％，新增加十多个品种，成本下降10％。
    这个厂结合生产跃进计划统一制定技术革新计划的作法，使技术革新和技术革命真正形成为广泛、持久的群众运动，并且上升到一个既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实的新阶段。去年以前，这个厂只有部分职工提技术革新建议，而且数量较少、质量比较低，零敲碎打，不能经常结合生产关键问题。实行这一新的作法以后，全厂的生产大军被组成为一支技术革命大军，每月都有计划、有准备、步调一致地猛攻技术“堡垒”。今年以来，经常提技术革新建议的职工，从去年占全体职工总数的30％上升到80％，全厂提出的技术革新建议比去年增加两倍。过去顾虑技术低、不敢提建议的徒工，许多都成了技术革新的闯将。经过群众的广泛讨论，许多技术革新建议被丰富起来，职工的技术水平迅速提高。
    这个厂由于每月都统一规划技术革新项目，集中组织各方面力量，分工限期完成，就使件件技术革新项目有了实现的保证。今年，这个厂的技术革新项目实现得又多又快又好又省，绝大部分技术革新计划在每月20日左右就能完成，大部分车间、小组都能百分之百地实现计划，与过去提了技术革新建议难于迅速实现的情况大不相同了。今年第二季度，这个厂承担了为人民大会堂等十多个工程制造花灯的任务。根据当时的技术条件，只有增加二百五十人才能按期完工。厂部立即召集老工人和技术人员进行研究，综合分析产品特点，掀起了以实现花灯制造机械化为中心的技术革新高潮。老工人刘树果制造“万能滚圆机”的建议列入了计划，技术人员主动帮助绘图，钳工、锻工也同他协作。在限期前一天，这架可以代替七十八个人手工操作的“万能滚圆机”投入生产，解决了滚制二十多万个花灯圆圈的大难题。由于实现了各项技术革新，这个厂没有增加一个人，就提前十天保质保量地完成了一万九千多盏灯的制造任务。
    现在，这个厂的工人们都称技术革新为生产的“先行官”。今年以来，全厂、车间、小组在检查生产时，首先检查技术革新计划的完成情况，并且予以公布，在群众中开展观摩、评比、竞赛；遇有问题，就群策群力加以解决。不久以前，三车间试制直丝机时，到限期前一天还有“卡铁丝卡不紧”的关键问题解决不了，生产科科长立即深入车间，同车间主任、老工人组成“攻坚队”，想了许多办法，巧干十二小时，终于在当晚试制成功，保证全车间提前十一天实现了跃进计划。（附图片）
