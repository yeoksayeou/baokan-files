Since the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses have produced thousands of advanced producers and created infinitely rich advanced experiences in their labor practice. In order to promote advanced experiences in a guided and organized manner, what problems do we need to solve in our guiding ideology? The following three issues are quite common and need to be unified in our understanding.

Promoting Advanced Experiences Must Promote Advanced Thinking

First, we must combine advanced thinking with advanced experiences. The decisive factor that enables an advanced producer to create advanced technology and experience, and climb to an advanced level of production is putting politics in command. Politics and ideology are the lifeline of production and construction work. Putting politics in command means strengthening the leadership of the Party and implementing the Party's General Line. For each producer, it means constantly improving their communist consciousness and implementing the spirit of the General Line in all their practical actions. From the deeds of advanced collectives and advanced producers in Shanghai, why does the Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory, located in a neighborhood, have such great ambition and be able to realize mechanization under the conditions of simple equipment and self-reliance? Why do workers at the General Pharmaceutical Factory have such courage, unafraid of more than 170 experimental failures, and finally successfully trial-produce the emerging product "Cortisone" in the international pharmaceutical industry? Why does driller Li Fuxiang never feel satisfied in technical revolution, put forward 59 innovation projects this year, and complete the national plan greatly ahead of schedule in six and a half months? Why does weaver Ni Haibao help others and persistently impart technology, enabling 80% of the workers in the entire workshop to reach the advanced operating level? There are many more such examples. This is not for any other reason, but because of their infinite loyalty to the Party, the people, and socialism, and therefore resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong; it is because they combine their own interests with the interests of the working class and the interests of the entire socialist cause, greatly developing the selfless collective spirit; it is because they go all out, aim high, and always hold high the ideological banner of continuous revolution. They are the pioneers in implementing the Party's General Line. They are not only pacesetters in production, but also pacesetters in communist ideology. It is precisely because they have such ideological qualities, and take the General Line as the guide of their thinking, that they can break free from the shackles of old production relations and habits, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and persist in unremitting struggle, and give full play to their intelligence and talent, so that every innovation can ensure the rapid, good, and economical development of production and construction. Advanced producers are highly valued by the Party and the government and enthusiastically loved by the masses, not only because their advanced experience can be mastered by the broad masses and become the wealth of the whole society, but also because their communist ideology will arm the broad masses and provide examples of how to correctly treat difficulties and problems in the construction cause. Therefore, in promoting advanced experiences, we must greatly promote communist ideology. The advanced thinking of advanced producers is a concrete and vivid teaching material for publicizing the Party's General Line. Only when advanced thinking is disseminated and promoted can it clear the obstacles of conservative complacency and other erroneous ideas for the promotion of advanced experiences, and can also provide a strong political and ideological impetus for continuous learning and promotion of advanced experiences. The practice of separating advanced thinking from advanced experience, only promoting advanced experience while ignoring the summarization and promotion of advanced thinking, or not strengthening political and ideological leadership in the promotion work, is actually a manifestation of right-leaning thinking that sees things but not people. It not only fails to promote the communist ideological qualities of advanced producers, but also cannot arouse the lasting and full enthusiasm of the broad masses to learn from the advanced.

Pay Attention to Popularization, But Also to Improvement

Second, spreading advanced experiences and further summarizing and developing advanced experiences in the process of promotion is both a process of popularization and a process of improvement. In human history, the level of advanced producers becoming the production level of the whole society has been an extremely slow process. In feudal society, "teaching apprentices starves the master," which made many people who mastered advanced production technology die with "unique skills"! Even if there was some teaching, they had to keep something back. In capitalist society, inventions and creations become the means and patents for the bourgeoisie to seize profits. Only in socialist society can advanced experiences be widely promoted, providing the greatest possibility for the level of advanced producers to rapidly become the level of the whole society. The mass movement of the Great Leap Forward is a revolutionary movement to rapidly transform the level of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society. The creation of advanced experiences is richer and more colorful than ever before, and the promotion of advanced experiences is also more widespread and rapid than ever before. On the one hand, the broad masses of laborers have a strong desire to go all out and aim high; on the other hand, advanced producers have a noble style of enthusiastically helping others. The combination of these two forces makes the process of advanced producers' level becoming the production level of the whole society a conscious process for the broad masses. When these advanced technologies and experiences are popularized and recognized and mastered by the majority of people, the entire social production level is improved. At the same time, this requires further improving the level of advanced producers in order to further improve the production level of the whole society. This process from popularization to improvement, and then popularization and re-improvement, is the process of production development and the process of the development of the socialist construction mass movement. Therefore, when an advanced production level appears on the horizon, we must promptly summarize and promote it, and popularize it to all units and producers; in the process of popularization, we must pay attention to the emergence of new advanced production levels, and seek re-improvement on the basis of new popularization. This process of popularization and improvement means that the production potential is endless, and the possibility of fully exploring and utilizing these potentials is constantly increasing. In February of this year, advanced workers in Shanghai's textile industry proposed the "Three Hundred Experts" initiative. After more than half a year, 40,000 roving frame workers in the city, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of roving frame workers, mastered advanced operating techniques. Now the Three Hundred Experts have revised their initiative to further improve the advanced operating level, and a new competition of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping has been launched enthusiastically. In the single item of fine yarn splicing technology, the average splicing speed has increased from 15 or 16 splices per minute to 17 or 18 splices per minute, and efforts are being made to eliminate white spots under the condition of accelerating the vehicle speed. It can be seen that without the foundation of popularization, there is no way to talk about improvement. Conversely, if a new thing is popularized and there is no higher-level thing to appear, the existing popularization will stop developing. Therefore, popularization and improvement are always closely inseparable. Ignoring any aspect will hinder the rapid development of production levels.

Some comrades only pay attention to cultivating advanced producers in isolation, and do not pay attention to popularizing their advanced experiences. They do not understand that valuing advanced figures means valuing the masses. Advanced producers are the backbone of the masses, and through them, we can unite, educate, and improve the broad masses and fight to eliminate backwardness and continuously improve labor productivity. One flower cannot make a spring. If advanced experiences are not popularized, the overall production level cannot be improved. It often happens that the advanced experience created by an enterprise in one place fails to be promoted in the enterprise and locally, but is widely used in other enterprises and other places. The masses criticize this phenomenon and say: "Flowers bloom inside the wall, but are fragrant outside." Why can't the garden where the flowers first bloom maintain fragrance and bear fruit? The reason lies in neglecting the popularization of advanced experience.

Learn Earnestly, Strive to Create

Third, we must combine learning and creation. Learning is for application, and new creations will emerge in application. This is a trend that must be noted in the promotion of advanced experiences. Some people think that creation is glorious, and learning seems to be not glorious. This is of course wrong. For each producer, learning advanced experience requires humble and earnest learning. However, the purpose of learning is for application. Since all advanced experiences are generated under certain specific conditions, to apply universal advanced experiences to one's own production tools and production objects, one must experiment, research, and identify them. Blindly copying regardless of conditions is not feasible. Also, since advanced experiences each have a certain scope and effect, we should distinguish the priorities and urgencies, and first organize the learning and promotion of advanced experiences that can solve the key and weak links in production. It is not only a call for promotion, but also a series of organizational and technical measures must be taken to enable limited manpower and material resources to achieve the greatest possible labor effect. Also, since advanced experiences not only have various production technology methods, but also reveal certain scientific and technological principles, in learning and promotion, we must also be good at applying these scientific and technological principles in conjunction with actual production conditions, and derive more advanced experiences from this scientific and technological principle. It is not considered to have learned experience if one cannot apply advanced experience to one's own practice. "Azure comes from blue but is better than blue." Without "coming from," there is no "better than." Without learning, there is no way to talk about exceeding. Conversely, if one does not dare to exceed, one cannot be considered to have truly learned well. Therefore, for each of our producers, learning advanced experience must be purposeful, step-by-step, and creatively. Recently, there was an example that attracted much attention. The Youth Technical Innovation Commando Team performed advanced drilling technology at the Safety Fire Equipment Factory. Ding Xingqing demonstrated the method of grinding drill bits, and it only took 40 seconds to drill a hole in medium-gray steel, which was eight times faster than ordinary drill bits. After learning this advanced technology, Wu Xifang and Zhu Bingsheng, the lathe operators of this factory, also analyzed Ding Xingqing's drill bit in detail, and combined the characteristics of their own lathes to create a new method of grinding drill bits, which shortened the processing time to 32 seconds. Yang Xinfu from the Shanglian Electrical Equipment Factory heard this news and immediately went to ask for advice. According to the conditions of his factory, combined with the collective experience of advanced drillers such as Li Fuxiang, he increased the drilling speed by four or five times. Who knew that Shen Xiangqin, a female worker at the Antai Iron Factory, learned from Yang Xinfu's experience and improved it, and the efficiency increased by more than two times. In just three days, the seed of an advanced experience blossomed four times. This example vividly shows that learning and promoting advanced experience is both a process of learning and application and a process of innovation and creation. Therefore, in our process of promoting advanced experiences, we must be good at combining learning and creation, so that the flowers of advanced experience bloom more luxuriantly each time, and the fruits of advanced experience are more abundant each time.

    推广先进经验需要注意的三个问题
    大跃进以来，广大群众在劳动实践中，涌现出千万个先进生产者，创造出无比丰富的先进经验，为着有领导有组织地推广先进经验，在我们指导思想上需要解决什么问题呢？以下三个问题颇带有普遍性，需要在我们的认识上求得统一。
    推广先进经验必须发扬先进思想
    首先，要把先进思想和先进经验结合起来。一个先进生产者所以能够创造先进技术和经验，攀上先进的生产水平，决定性的因素是政治挂帅。政治和思想是生产建设工作的生命线，所谓政治挂帅，就是加强党的领导，贯彻执行党的总路线。对每个生产者来说，就是要不断提高共产主义觉悟，把总路线精神贯彻到自己的一切实际行动中去。从上海市先进集体和先进生产者的事迹中来看，为什么设在里弄中的永鑫无缝钢管厂有偌大的志气，能够在设备简陋和自力更生的条件下实现了机械化？为什么通用药厂工人有如此的胆略，不怕一百七十多次的试验失败，终于试制成功国际医药工业新兴产品“可的松”？为什么钻工李福祥在技术革命中永不满足，今年以来提出五十九个革新项目，以六个半月时间大大提前完成国家计划？为什么织布工倪海宝以助人为乐，坚持不懈地传授技术，使全车间80％的工人达到先进操作水平？这样的事例还有很多很多。这不是别的原因，而是由于他们对党对人民对社会主义有无限的忠诚，因而坚决地依靠党和毛泽东同志的领导；是由于他们把自己的利益和工人阶级的利益、整个社会主义事业的利益结合为一体，大大发扬了大公无私的集体主义精神；是由于他们鼓足干劲、力争上游，始终高举不断革命的思想旗帜。他们是贯彻执行党的总路线的先锋。他们不仅是生产上的标兵，也是共产主义思想的标兵。正是由于他们具有这样的思想品质，以总路线作为自己思想的指导，因而能够摆脱旧生产关系和习惯势力的羁绊，敢想敢说敢做，坚持不懈地奋斗，充分发挥自己的聪明才干，使每个革新创造都能保证生产和建设多快好省地发展。先进生产者所以受到党与政府的极大重视和群众的热烈爱戴，不仅是他们的先进经验能够为广大群众所掌握，成为全社会的财富，而且还由于他们的共产主义思想，将武装广大群众，提供了如何正确对待建设事业中的困难和问题的榜样。因此，在推广先进经验中，必须大大发扬共产主义思想。先进生产者的先进思想，就是具体生动地宣传党的总路线的活教材。只有先进思想传播了、发扬了，才能为先进经验的推广，扫清保守自满等错误思想的障碍，也才能使不断学习和推广先进经验，具有强有力的政治思想动力。那种把先进思想和先进经验分割开来，只去推广先进经验而忽视对先进思想的总结和推广，或者不在推广工作中加强政治思想领导的见物不见人的做法，实际上是政治不挂帅的右倾思想的表现。它不仅不能发扬先进生产者的共产主义思想品质，而且也不可能激起广大群众学习先进的持久饱满的热情。
    既要注意普及　还要重视提高
    其次，把先进经验推广开去和在推广的过程中进一步总结、发展先进经验，这既是普及的过程，又是提高的过程。在人类历史上，先进生产者的水平变为全社会的生产水平，曾经是极其缓慢的过程。封建社会里，“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”，使许多掌握了先进生产技术的人怀着“绝技”与世长辞！即便是有所传授，也不得不留一手。资本主义社会里，发明创造成为资产阶级攫取利润的手段和专利品。只有在社会主义社会，才能广泛推广先进经验，为先进生产者的水平迅速变为全社会水平提供最大的可能性。大跃进的群众运动，是高速度地把先进生产者水平变为全社会生产水平的革命运动，先进经验的创造比任何时候来得丰富多采，先进经验的推广也比任何时候来得广泛迅速。一方面，广大劳动者有鼓足干劲、力争上游的强烈愿望，另方面，先进生产者有热情帮助别人的高尚风格，这两种力量的结合，就使先进生产者的水平变为全社会生产水平的过程，成为广大群众自觉的过程。当这些先进技术和经验得到普及，为多数人所认识和掌握时，就使整个社会生产水平提高了。同时，这就又需要进一步提高先进生产者的水平，以便把全社会的生产水平更进一步的提高。这个从普及到提高、再普及再提高的过程，就是生产发展的过程，就是社会主义建设群众运动发展的过程。因此，当一个先进生产水平露出在地平线上时，我们要及时总结和推广它，把它普及到一切单位和生产者；在普及的过程中，我们又要注意新的先进生产水平的出现，求得在新的普及基础上的再提高。这种普及和提高的过程，意味着生产潜力是无穷无尽的，充分发掘和利用这些潜力的可能性也是不断增长的。今年2月，上海市纺织工业先进工人提出“三百能手”倡议，经过大半年，全市四万挡车工，即占总数70％以上的挡车工，掌握了先进操作技术。现时三百能手又修订了她们的倡议，把先进操作水平再提高一步，新的比、学、赶、帮的竞赛又热烈展开了。仅细纱接头技术一项，即由原来每分钟接头十五、六根，普遍提高到十七、八根，而且争取做到在车速加快的条件下消灭白点。可见，没有普及的基础，就谈不上提高，反过来，如果一个新事物普及了，再没有更高级事物的出现，已有的普及就停止了发展，因此，普及和提高总是密切不可分的。忽视任何一面，都会阻碍生产水平的迅速发展。
    有些同志只注意孤立地培养先进生产者，而不注意普及他们的先进经验。他们不了解重视先进人物，就是重视群众。先进生产者是群众中的骨干，通过他们可以团结、教育和提高广大群众，为消除落后、不断提高劳动生产率而斗争。一朵鲜花是打扮不出春色的，先进经验不普及，整个生产水平就不可能提高。常常有这样的情况，一个企业一地创造的先进经验，在本企业本地未能得到推广，而却在别的企业别地得到广泛运用，群众批评这种现象说：“墙内开花墙外香”，为什么首先开花的园地不能保持芬芳，不能结出果实呢？原因就在于忽视先进经验的推广普及。
    既要认真学习　更要努力创造
    再次，要把学习和创造结合起来。学习为了运用，在运用中会有新创造，这是推广先进经验中必须注意到的一个趋势。有的人以为创造是光荣的，学习好像就不光荣了，这当然是不对的。对每个生产者来说，学习先进经验要虚心地学，认真地学。但是，学习的目的是为了运用。由于一切先进经验都是在一定的具体条件下产生的，要把普遍的先进经验运用到自己的生产工具和生产对象上来，必须加以试验、研究和鉴别，不顾条件盲目地生搬硬套是不行的。又由于先进经验各有一定的范围和效果，我们应该分别轻重缓急，首先组织对能够解决生产关键和薄弱环节的先进经验来学习和推广，不仅是号召推广，而且要采取一系列的组织和技术措施，才能使有限的人力物力，取得尽可能大的劳动效果。还由于先进经验不仅有各种生产技术的方法，而且揭示了一定的科学技术原理，因而在学习和推广中，又要善于把这些科学技术原理结合实际生产情况加以运用，从这一科学技术原理中，引出更多的先进经验来。不会把先进经验运用到自己的实践中，算不得学到了经验。“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”，没有“出于”就没有“胜于”，没有学习，就谈不上超过。反过来，不敢超过，也就不能算真正的学好。因此，对我们每个生产者来说，学习先进经验，又必须是有目的有步骤地学，创造性地学。最近有个例子很引人注意。青年技术革新突击队在安全消防器材厂表演先进钻工技术，丁杏清表演磨钻头的方法，只花了四十秒钟就钻成了中灰钢的洞眼，比普通钻头快八倍。这个厂的车工吴锡芳、朱炳生学到这个先进技术，而且还详细分析了丁杏清的钻头，结合自己车床的特点，创造了新的磨钻头的方法，使加工时间缩短到三十二秒钟。这个消息又被上联电工器材厂杨新富听到了，连忙去讨教，又根据本厂条件，结合李福祥等先进钻工的集体经验，再把钻速提高了四、五倍。谁知安泰铁工厂女工沈湘琴又学习了杨新富的经验加以改进，效率又提高了二倍多。在短短的三天里，一颗先进经验的种子，就开了四次花。这个例子生动地表明了，学习和推广先进经验，既是学习运用又是革新创造的过程。因此，在我们推广先进经验的过程中要善于把学习和创造结合起来，使先进经验的花朵一次比一次开得茂盛，先进经验结出的果实一次比一次丰硕。
