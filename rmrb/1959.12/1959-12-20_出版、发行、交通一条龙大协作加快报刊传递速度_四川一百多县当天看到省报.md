    Publication, Distribution, and Transportation Form a Coordinated "One-Dragon" Effort to Accelerate Newspaper Delivery Speed
    Over One Hundred Counties in Sichuan Can Now Read the Provincial Newspaper on the Same Day
    (Our report) Sichuan Province, in newspaper distribution, has put forward the idea of postal communications taking newspaper distribution as the key link, and accelerating distribution speed as the center, to carry out a "one-dragon" collaborative effort among publication, distribution, and transportation, achieving good results.
    Currently, central-level aviation edition newspapers (printed before 6:00 PM in winter) can be delivered to readers in the Chengdu urban area on the same day; the number of cities and counties across the province that can read the provincial newspaper on the same day has increased from thirty-eight to one hundred and two. In terms of the quality of newspaper distribution, this year has seen a reduction in the error rate to 0.038 per ten thousand copies for the sealing and dispatching of twelve million copies of newspapers, and a further increase in overall labor productivity by 58% compared to last year. Last year, it took six to seven hours to seal and dispatch 480,000 copies of newspapers; now it only takes about four hours to dispatch 700,000 copies. This year, during the National Day celebrations, the number of newspapers increased sharply by four to five times, but it was still ensured that they were dispatched and transported on the same day and shift.
    The "one-dragon" collaboration in newspaper distribution work involves close cooperation among newspaper offices, post offices, and relevant transportation departments, signing agreements, and establishing necessary systems, linking each step together to save delivery time from all aspects, striving to deliver newspapers to readers at the fastest speed.
    When carrying out the "one-dragon" collaboration in newspaper distribution work, the Chengdu Municipal Postal and Telecommunications Bureau first required its employees to establish the communist spirit of collaboration of "leaving the difficulties to oneself and delivering convenience to others" in their thinking, and to take this as their slogan for action. Then, a series of collaborative meetings were held with newspaper offices and relevant transportation departments, and collaborative agreements were signed. Many collaborative systems were also established within the post office's relevant departments.
    The Chengdu Municipal Postal and Telecommunications Bureau also formulated several different distribution plans in response to the reality that newspapers sometimes cannot be published on time. If the publication time is delayed for some reason, and the newspapers cannot be fully distributed, in addition to stepping up the rush transportation and distribution, priority is given to key areas first. They also formulated a detailed distribution schedule based on the actual situation of transportation, specifically stipulating when to start printing and which areas to send to first. This avoids temporary confusion and allows for as many newspapers as possible to be sent out.
    The Chengdu Municipal Postal and Telecommunications Bureau has also made many improvements in the newspaper dispatch procedures. For example, the original large assembly line operation for sealing and dispatching newspapers has been changed to sectional sealing and dispatching for each postal route, which not only facilitates centralized catching of trains but also shortens the sealing and dispatching time by more than half. For the three links of sealing and dispatching, exchange, and transshipment, unified command and unified dispatch are implemented, and the masses are mobilized to compress the internal processing time of each link as much as possible. In order to catch up with the Rong-Yu (Chongqing) and Rong-Yi (Yibin) trains twice, they adopted the method of having the dispatchers board the train with the newspapers to seal and dispatch them, so that thirty-some counties in four special districts could see the newspapers sent from Chengdu half a day to a day earlier.
    Since the implementation of collaboration, the railway, highway, waterway, and civil aviation departments of Sichuan Province have actively cooperated with the postal departments to do a good job in newspaper distribution. When newspapers are temporarily increased in size and the postal cars cannot accommodate them, the railway bureau squeezes out baggage cars for transportation. Railway station and postal and telecommunications personnel cooperate closely, often helping each other to rush loading and unloading newspapers, mail, and goods, so that many newspapers that could not catch the train in the past can now catch it.
    When newspapers miss the bus, the highway transportation department also tries to entrust passing cars to carry them or tries to allocate cars for special transportation. Many bus stations are able to "load and transport whenever there is a car, as soon as it arrives," and there are no restrictions on the amount of transport.
    Shipping and civil aviation stations also cooperate closely with the post office to accelerate the transfer of newspapers.
    Due to the large-scale collaboration from top to bottom and inside and outside, the transfer speed of newspapers in Sichuan Province has been greatly improved. For example, Chengdu to Kangding used to take twenty-four hours, but now it has been shortened to thirteen and a half hours. Therefore, the proportion of communes and factories along this line that can see the provincial newspaper on the same day has increased from the original 73% to 95%. Kangding readers wrote a poem to praise the post office's vigor: "Wind and snow are mixed with fog filling the sky, Ambition overwhelms Erlang Mountain, Leaping Forward songs are rising everywhere, The provincial newspaper arrives at the plateau on the same day."
    After the newspaper distribution work at the stations along the main transportation lines was accelerated, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels and the Sichuan Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration, the county post offices also stipulated that the arrival time of the provincial newspaper should be the departure time for rural postmen; newspapers arriving at the bureau before 8:00 PM should be delivered internally in the town on the same day. The district post offices also took the arrival time of newspapers at the county bureau as the departure time; the township and commune postmen also did "deliver as soon as they arrive." Many county bureaus have also adjusted postal routes to more closely connect with trunk lines, shortening the handover time along the lines; some have also implemented day and night travel to shorten delivery time. In this way, the distribution speed of newspapers has been further improved.

### 出版、发行、交通一条龙大协作加快报刊传递速度  四川一百多县当天看到省报

    出版、发行、交通一条龙大协作加快报刊传递速度
    四川一百多县当天看到省报
    本报讯　四川省在报刊发行方面，提出了邮政通讯以报纸发行为纲，以加快发行速度为中心，开展出版、发行、交通“一条龙”大协作，取得了良好效果。
    目前，中央级的航空版报纸（冬季在下午六时前印出），成都市区内可以当天投送给读者；全省能看到当天省报的市县由三十八个增加到一百零二个。发报质量上，今年取得了封发一千二百万份报纸差错率降低到万分之零点三八，综合劳动生产率比去年再提高58％。去年封发四十八万份报需要六、七小时，现在发七十万份报只要四小时左右。今年国庆节报纸猛增四、五倍，也还是保证了当天当班发运。
    报纸发行工作的一条龙协作，就是由报社、邮局和有关交通运输部门紧密合作，签订协议，制定必要的制度，一环套一环，从各个环节上节省传递时间，争取以最快的速度，把报纸送给读者。
    在开展报纸发行工作一条龙协作的时候，成都市邮电局首先要求职工在思想上树立“把困难留给自己、把方便送给别人”的共产主义协作精神，并以此作为行动的口号。接着就和报社、有关交通运输部门举行了一系列的协作会议，并签定了协作协议。邮局内部有关环节，也订了许多协作制度。
    成都市邮电局还针对报纸有时不能准时出版的实际情况，作出了几种不同的发行方案。如果出版时间因故推迟，报纸不能全部发出，除了加紧抢运抢发外，首先照顾重点。他们还根据交通运输的实际情况，制定了详细的发行计划表，具体规定什么时候开印，先发那些地方。这就避免了临时混乱，能够尽量多发出些报纸。
    在发报手续上，成都市邮电局也作了不少的改进。如封发报纸，把原来的大流水作业，改为每条邮路分段封发，既便于集中赶车，又可以缩短封发时间一半以上。对于封发、交换、转运三个环节，实行统一指挥，统一调度，并且发动群众，让各个环节尽量压缩内部处理时间。为了争取赶上蓉渝、蓉宜（宾）两次火车，他们采取了发报人随报上车封发的办法，使四个专区三十几个县能够提早半天到一天看到成都发出的报纸。
    开展协作以后，四川省铁路、公路、水运和民用航空等部门，主动配合邮政部门做好报纸发行工作。当报纸临时加张，邮车装不下的时候，铁路局就挤出行李车装运。火车站和邮电局人员亲密合作，经常互相帮助抢装抢卸报纸、邮件和货物，使许多过去不能赶上火车的报纸，也能赶上了。
    公路运输部门，当报纸赶不上班车的时候，也想法托过路的汽车带运，或设法调拨车子专运。很多汽车站都做到“有车就载，随到随运”，运量也不限制。
    轮船运输和民用航空站，也都紧密地和邮局协作，加快报纸转运工作。
    由于上下内外的大协作，四川省报纸的转运速度有了很大的提高。如成都到康定，原来要二十四小时，现在缩短到十三小时半。因此，这条线上当天能看到省报的公社和厂矿的比重就由原来的73％扩大到了95％。康定读者为此写了一首诗，赞扬邮局的干劲：风雪交加雾满天，雄心压倒二郎山，跃进歌声四处起，省报当天到高原。
    各主要运输干线沿途各站的报纸发行工作加快以后，在各级党委和四川省邮电管理局领导下，各县邮局也规定以省报到达时间为乡邮员出班时间；在下午八时以前到局报纸，城镇内部都要当天投送。区邮局又以县局报纸到达时间为出班时间；乡社邮递员也都做到“随到随投”。许多县局为了更紧密地衔接干线，还调整了邮路，缩短了沿线交接时间；有的还实行昼夜兼程，缩短投递时间。这样，报纸的发行速度，又得到了进一步的提高。
