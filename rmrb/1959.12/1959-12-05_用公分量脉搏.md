	Measuring Pulse with Centimeters

	If you heard someone measuring pulse with centimeters, you would surely find it ridiculous.

	However, such a thing did happen.

	Before clocks were invented in the Middle Ages, doctors used centimeters to measure pulse. This came from the pendulum's length. Galileo studied the laws of pendulum motion and proved that "the frequency of oscillation is inversely proportional to the length of the pendulum; the longer the length, the smaller the oscillation frequency and the larger the oscillation period." Later, doctors adjusted the length of the pendulum so that the oscillation frequency of the pendulum was the same as the number of human pulse beats, thereby deriving the unit of pulse.

### 用公分量脉搏

    用公分量脉搏
    如果你听说有人用公分量脉搏，一定觉得可笑。
    但是，真有过这等事。
    在中世纪还没有发明钟表的时候，医生们就是用公分量脉搏的。这是由单摆的摆长而来。伽利略曾研究单摆的摆动规律，证明：“摆动频率和摆长成反比，摆长越大则摆动频率越小而摆动周期越大。”后来，医生们就调节摆长使单摆的摆动频率与人脉搏的跳动次数相同，从而得出脉搏的单位。
