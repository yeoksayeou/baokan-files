　　Endless Granaries and Pastures

　　The Nenjiang Special District is located in the northwest of Heilongjiang Province, with a vast territory and fertile soil. The total area of the district is 130 million mu, most of which is black soil. Arable land accounts for more than one-third, and there are large areas of natural pastures with abundant water and grass. The Nenjiang River runs through the entire district, with a dense network of tributaries and many lakes, making water resources very rich. At the foot of the Greater Khingan Mountains in the north, there are some hilly areas, and the rest are plains. The frost-free period is about 120 days, and the rainfall is about 500 millimeters. It is suitable for the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. With Qiqihar as the center, four railways pass through the special district.

　　In 1947, the state established China's first state-owned mechanical farm, Tongbei Farm (the predecessor of the current Zhaoguang Farm), in Bei'an County, Nenjiang Special District. The film "The Story of a Veteran Soldier" depicts the establishment of this farm. At that time, there were twelve tractors, and 19,815 mu were reclaimed and sown in the first year. This is only equivalent to the scale of a small production team of a general mechanical farm today.

　　This year, the total grain output of farms and pastures in this special district increased by 53 percent compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and the unit area yield increased by 52 percent; the number of large livestock increased by 41 percent compared with 1958, pigs increased by nearly two times, chickens and ducks increased by two times, and sideline income increased by 220 percent; the industrial output value increased by two times. Calculated on the basis of the current 62,141 employees in the farms and pastures of the entire special district, each person cultivates 70 mu of land this year (on nine large farms, each person cultivates an average of 217 mu), and each person produces more than 14,300 jin of grain per year. Each person raises an average of 2.5 pigs, half a sheep, five poultry, and one head of large livestock. The average sideline production value created by each person is 134 yuan. The commodity grain sold to the state averages more than 8,200 jin per person. In 1958 and 1959, each person sold an average of 25 jin of pork, 354 jin of milk, 3 jin of wool, and 3.5 jin of eggs to the state. This year, the average profit turned over to the state by each person is 400 yuan. In the first year of the farm's establishment, the average yield of wheat per mu was 53 jin, which is only one-quarter of this year's average yield per mu.

　　一望无边的粮仓和牧场
    嫩江专区位于黑龙江省的西北部，地域广阔，土质肥沃。全区面积一亿三千万亩，大部分是黑土地，可耕地占三分之一以上，有大面积的水草丰美的天然牧场。纵穿全区的嫩江，支流密布，湖泊很多，水利资源非常丰富。北部大兴安岭脚下，有一部分丘陵岗地，其余都是平原。常年无霜期一百二十天左右，降雨量约五百毫米。这里适宜农、林、牧、副、渔的发展。以齐齐哈尔为中心，有四条铁路穿过专区境内。
    一九四七年，国家在嫩江专区的北安县建立了我国第一个国营机械农场——通北农场（即现在赵光农场前身），电影“老兵新传”就是描写这个农场创立经过的，当时有十二台拖拉机，第一年开荒播种一万九千八百一十五亩。这只抵得上现在一般机械农场的小生产队的规模。
    今年这个专区的农场、牧场，粮食总产量比大跃进的一九五八年增长百分之五十三，单位面积产量提高百分之五十二；大家畜的头数比一九五八年增加百分之四十一，猪增加近两倍，鸡鸭增长两倍，副业收入增长百分之二百二十；工业产值增加两倍。按全专区农场、牧场现有职工六万二千一百四十一人平均计算，今年每人种地七十亩（九处大型农场，平均每人种地二百一十七亩），每人一年生产粮食一万四千三百多斤。每人平均养猪两口半，养羊半只，养家禽五只，养大牲畜一头。每人平均创造副业生产价值一百三十四元。卖给国家的商品粮，平均每人八千二百多斤。一九五八、一九五九两年，平均每人卖给国家二十五斤猪肉、三百五十四斤牛奶、三斤羊毛、三斤半鸡蛋。今年平均每人上缴给国家的利润是四百元。农场兴办第一年平均每亩收小麦五十三斤，只合今年平均每亩产量的四分之一。
