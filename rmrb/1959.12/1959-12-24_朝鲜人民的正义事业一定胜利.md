　　The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, headed by Zhu De, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, wrote letters on the 23rd to Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's of Korea, and the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland of Korea, respectively, expressing their full support for the proposal put forward by the Korean Supreme People's Assembly for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    The letter from the Korean Supreme People's Assembly to the parliaments of all countries on the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea, since its release on October 27, has received responses and support from the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and fair-minded public opinion around the world. This is because a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the early realization of Korean reunification will not only relieve the long-term pain of the division of the Korean nation and reflect the long-cherished wishes of the thirty million Korean people, but also be a crucial key to safeguarding and consolidating the cause of peace in Asia and the world. The Korean nation has suffered the fate of artificial division for more than fourteen years, and the Korean Armistice Agreement, which provides new possibilities for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, has been signed for more than six years. All peace-loving countries and people in the world are eager for the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea to be further resolved, thereby helping to eliminate the tensions in the Far East and Asia caused by the aggressive policies of the United States. As everyone knows, since the restoration of peace in Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a series of fair and reasonable proposals aimed at peacefully resolving the Korean issue. In order to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China have taken many positive measures. The complete and voluntary withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea in October 1958 is the most powerful proof. The recent appeal from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the national parliaments, and the reply from Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, once again demonstrate the great efforts and sincere wishes of the governments and peoples of China and Korea to ease international tensions.

    The matter is very clear: the fundamental reason why the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea has not been resolved to this day lies in the fact that the American aggressor troops are stubbornly staying in South Korea, unwilling to end their sinful occupation of this part of Korean territory. More than a year after the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, the continued stationing of American troops in South Korea can only demonstrate that the American authorities have no intention of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and are waiting for an opportunity to re-launch a war of aggression against North Korea; there can be no other explanation. In fact, the United States not only refuses to withdraw its troops from South Korea, but has also been intensifying its arms expansion and war preparations in South Korea and plotting to undermine the peaceful reunification of Korea. The United States has seriously violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, expanding the armed forces of the Syngman Rhee group, increasing the number of divisions from sixteen at the time of the armistice to the current thirty-one. The United States has also illegally transported 280mm atomic cannons, "Honest John" rockets, "Matador" missiles, and other new weapons into South Korea. In May of this year, Draper, Chairman of the U.S. President's "Foreign Aid Program Research Committee," testified frankly in secret before the U.S. Congress, blatantly calling Korea a "real front line" and saying that "it is currently a truce, not peace." Recently, certain figures in the upper echelons of the U.S. ruling group, while talking glibly about peace, have been desperately creating tensions in the Far East. U.S. Undersecretary of State Dillon even clamored that the "tensions" in the Far East "show no signs of easing," and therefore loudly called for stepping up the "rearmament and modernization" of the Syngman Rhee army. Syngman Rhee is also clamoring for "preparing to use all weapons," and so on. At the same time, the United States is also staging a "cold war" farce in the United Nations, unreasonably refusing representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in discussions on the Korean issue, and forcibly passing a one-sided proposal put forward by the United States and fourteen other countries that invaded Korea. All this shows that the United States is doing everything possible to try to keep American troops stationed in South Korea, obstruct Korea from moving towards peaceful reunification, and plot to re-launch a war of aggression one day.

    The continued stationing of American troops in South Korea and the American plot to maintain tensions in the Far East by exploiting the division of Korea fully expose the true face of the U.S. ruling group's feigned peace. As our Chairman Zhu De pointed out in his letter to Chairman Choi Yong-kun of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea: Since the U.S. government has also stated that all unresolved international issues should be resolved peacefully through negotiations, it should seriously consider the just appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and quickly take measures to prove its sincerity for peace with the actual action of withdrawing American troops from South Korea. This is a minimal test of whether the U.S. government is willing to ease international tensions.

    The Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their homeland has the sympathy and support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and people in the world. The Chinese people have always unswervingly supported this just cause of the Korean people, and firmly believe that Korea will surely be reunified, and the just cause of the Korean people will surely achieve final victory.

### 朝鲜人民的正义事业一定胜利

　　朝鲜人民的正义事业一定胜利
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会，23日分别写信给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健和朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会，对朝鲜最高人民会议提出的要求实现朝鲜和平统一的建议，表示完全支持。
    朝鲜最高人民会议就朝鲜的和平统一问题给世界各国议会的信，自从10月27日发出以来，已获得以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界公正舆论的响应和支持。这是因为和平解决朝鲜问题、早日实现朝鲜的统一，不仅将解除朝鲜民族长期分裂的痛苦、反映了三千万朝鲜人民梦寐以求的愿望；而且也是维护和巩固亚洲和世界和平事业的一个重要关键。朝鲜民族遭受人为分裂的命运已经十四年多了，为和平解决朝鲜问题提供新的可能性的朝鲜停战的协定也已经签订六年多了，全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民都渴望朝鲜和平统一问题能够进一步得到解决，从而有利于消除远东和亚洲的由于美国的侵略政策而引起的紧张局势。大家都知道，自从朝鲜和平恢复以来，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国曾经提出过一系列旨在和平解决朝鲜问题的公平合理的方案。为了促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国都曾采取了许多积极的措施。1958年10月，中国人民志愿军主动地全部撤出朝鲜就是最有力的证明。这次朝鲜民主主义人民共和国致各国国会的呼吁信、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的复函，再一次表明了中朝两国政府和人民对于缓和国际紧张局势所作的重大努力和真诚愿望。
    事情非常明白，朝鲜的和平统一问题之所以直到现在还悬而未决，根本原因就在于美国侵略军队死赖在南朝鲜，不愿结束对朝鲜这一部分国土的罪恶的占领制度。中国人民志愿军全部从朝鲜撤退已经一年多的今天，美国军队继续留驻南朝鲜，除了只能说明美国当局无意和平解决朝鲜问题，并且等待时机重新发动侵略朝鲜北部的战争以外，不能有其他任何解释。事实上美国不仅拒绝从南朝鲜撤军，而且一直在南朝鲜变本加厉地进行着扩军备战和破坏朝鲜和平统一的阴谋。美国严重地破坏朝鲜停战协定，扩充了李承晚集团的武装部队，把停战时的十六个师增至现在的三十一个师。美国还把二百八十毫米的原子炮、“诚实的约翰”式火箭、“斗牛士”式导弹和其它新型武器非法运入南朝鲜。今年5月间，美国总统“援外计划研究委员会”主席德莱柏在美国国会秘密作证时曾露骨地把朝鲜说成是“真正的前线”，并且说“目前是休战而不是和平”。最近，美国统治集团的某些上层人物一面在侈谈和平，一面又拼命在远东制造紧张局势。美国副国务卿狄龙就叫嚷远东“紧张局势”“没有任何缓和的迹象”，因此大叫要加紧李承晚军队的“重新武装和现代化”。李承晚也在叫嚣“准备使用一切武器”等等。与此同时，美国还在联合国内导演“冷战”丑剧，无理地拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加关于朝鲜问题的讨论，并且强行通过了美国等十四个侵朝国家提出的片面提案。这一切都表明，美国千方百计地力图使美国军队继续赖在南朝鲜，阻挠朝鲜走向和平统一，阴谋有朝一日重新发动侵略战争。
    美国军队继续留驻南朝鲜以及美国利用朝鲜的分裂局面保持远东紧张局势的阴谋，充分地暴露了美国统治集团伪装和平的真实面目。正如我国朱德委员长在致朝鲜民主主义人民共和国崔庸健委员长的信中所指出：美国政府既然也曾经表示，一切没有解决的国际问题都应该通过谈判和平解决，那么，就应该郑重考虑朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议的正义呼吁，迅速采取措施，以从南朝鲜撤退美国军队的实际行动来证明自己对和平的诚意。这是对美国政府是否愿意缓和国际紧张局势的一个最起码的考验。
    朝鲜人民为自己祖国的和平统一而进行的正义斗争有着以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持。中国人民始终不渝地支持朝鲜人民的这一正义事业，并且坚定地相信，朝鲜必将统一，朝鲜人民的正义事业必将获得最后的胜利。
