Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Central government agencies in 1959 continued to earnestly implement the Central Committee's directive on cadres participating in physical labor training, achieving a double harvest of labor and ideology. Cadres in various agencies have participated in labor training for an average of over one month. Through labor training, a new atmosphere of close contact with reality and love for labor has generally formed within the agencies.

In 1959, various agencies continued to send cadres to the grassroots for longer periods of labor training, while also organizing all active cadres to participate in short-term physical labor. According to statistics, this year a total of more than 6,600 cadres from various agencies were sent to the grassroots for labor training lasting about a year. In addition to this, all active cadres were organized to participate in various construction projects such as the Great Hall of the People, the Miyun Reservoir, and the greening project in the suburbs of the capital. Some agencies rotated cadres to go to the countryside and factories to work as commune members and workers; some agencies, during the busy farming season, dispatched cadres to support farmers in the suburbs of the capital in drought resistance, flood control, rush harvesting, and rush planting; most agencies also established their own sideline production bases, sending cadres in rotation to carry out sideline production such as pig raising and vegetable growing. Through this series of production and construction activities, the vast majority of cadres generally received training in physical labor. Although the tasks of the agencies were unprecedentedly heavy this year during the continuing Great Leap Forward and the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, the average time cadres spent participating in physical labor training still exceeded one month.

Leading cadres in many agencies squeezed time out of their busy work to take the lead in participating in physical labor and solved many practical problems and improved their leadership style while going deep into the grassroots to participate in labor. Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of Health, became a commune member in Miluo Commune, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province. He worked during the day, participated in flood prevention battles at night, and patrolled the dikes with the masses in the rain late at night, which greatly encouraged the local people. In the intervals of labor, Comrade Xu Yunbei also investigated many public canteens in this commune, visited some patients, and held discussions with many Chinese and Western medical personnel. Based on extensive and in-depth investigation, he wrote the "Report on the Health Work of Miluo Commune," which put forward some problems that urgently needed to be solved in rural health work after communization. Wu Bo, Vice Minister of Finance, Peng Tao, Minister of Chemical Industry, Xiao Guichang, Vice Minister, and Liu Ziju, Vice Minister of Labor, and other leading cadres, respectively, went to people's communes and factories to work as commune members and workers, eating, living, and working with the workers and peasants. They also combined participation in physical labor with going deep into the grassroots to inspect work, drawing experience from the creative labor of the masses, discovering problems, and enriching their leadership thinking.

The vast majority of cadres showed great enthusiasm in their labor, all believing that it was the greatest honor to be an "ordinary laborer." In the Great Hall of the People construction site, 817 cadres from central government agencies were rated as labor activists and received awards from the general headquarters of the construction site. Cadres from various agencies also extensively carried out service activities on the construction site, using their rest time to write letters, mend clothes, explain current affairs, and teach literacy to construction workers, and held 372 consolation performances. The service activities totaled more than 20 items, and were warmly welcomed by the workers. More than 4,000 cadres from more than ten units, including the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Construction Engineering, took turns to support the Miyun Reservoir construction project. Although the labor time for each batch did not exceed one month, the vast majority of cadres also regarded the construction site as their home, and put forward more than 8,000 rationalization proposals in the labor, and each time they greatly advanced and overfulfilled the tasks assigned by the construction site headquarters.

Through eating, living, and working with the vast number of workers and peasants, the vast majority of cadres established deep class feelings with the masses. A large number of cadres from more than 40 units of central government agencies, while participating in wheat harvesting in the suburbs, although they worked intensively for more than 12 hours a day, and sometimes fought hard overnight, they still took time to carry water and sweep the yards for their farmer landlords, establishing deep friendships with the local farmers. Many farmers secretly stuffed peanuts and other comforting items into the cadres' luggage while the cadres were working in the fields. When they parted, the farmers sent them off far, far away from the village, reluctant to leave. A female cadre from the First Ministry of Machine Building used to think that farmers were dirty and stupid, and would cover her nose when she saw a farmer who was dressed a little worn. After she was sent to the countryside this year, she was deeply educated by the farmers' soaring enthusiasm and creativity in production. Not long after she arrived in the countryside, she moved into the home of a poor peasant. When the wife and children of this poor peasant were sick, she worked during the day and boiled water and decocted medicine at night, taking care of the children's excrement and urine like a family member.

Many cadres also received a concrete and profound education on the general line through labor. The central government cadres who participated in the construction project of the Great Hall of the People all deeply felt that the completion of this huge project in ten months was the result of implementing the general line and was a model of more, faster, better, and more economical. They intimately felt the great power of collective labor of the working masses. After many cadres participated in the voluntary labor of rush harvesting wheat and rush harvesting autumn vegetables in the suburbs of Beijing, they saw with their own eyes that although Beijing encountered a flood that had not been seen in decades this year, and many lands were flooded several times and replanted several times, they still achieved a bumper harvest of wheat and an unprecedented bumper harvest of autumn vegetables, and therefore deeply realized the superiority of the people's communes and the soaring enthusiasm of the farmers. After many people returned to their agencies after labor, they all formulated new leap forward plans and exerted greater enthusiasm in their work.

Through labor training, the tendency of intellectual cadres to detach themselves from reality has been greatly changed, and many people have realized that frequent participation in labor training and frequent contact with the masses is a fundamental way to achieve both redness and expertise. Many units such as the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and the Ministry of Culture have sent cadres with professional knowledge to the countryside. While participating in agricultural labor, they spread technology and culture, and played a very good role in helping people's communes to run industries, build water conservancy projects, and establish agricultural middle schools. They said that down below they were both using their mouths and hands, and using both their brains and hands. The past "false knowledge" became "true knowledge," and "one-sided knowledge" became "comprehensive knowledge." Therefore, sending them down for training was not "abandoning expertise for redness," but rather a combination of redness and expertise, and better playing the role of professional knowledge on the basis of wholeheartedly serving the masses and contacting the masses and connecting with reality. After two section chiefs of the Exploration and Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering realized the importance of contacting the masses and connecting with reality through labor training, when they studied how to improve drilling speed this year, they were distressed by the lack of practical experience. They went to the construction site to participate in labor for a month and worked with the workers to jointly create a high production record of drilling a well in three days and continuously drilling nine wells in 28 days, thus exploring some effective experience to guide the entire work.

　　通过劳动锻炼走向又红又专
    中央国家机关干部参加劳动时间平均已超过一个月
    新华社29日讯　中央国家机关在1959年继续认真执行了中央关于干部参加体力劳动锻炼的指示，获得了劳动、思想双丰收。各机关的干部参加劳动锻炼的时间，平均已超过一个月，通过劳动锻炼，机关内普遍形成了密切联系实际、热爱劳动的新风气。
    1959年内各机关一方面继续下放干部到基层进行较长时间的劳动锻炼，一方面组织全体在职干部参加短期的体力劳动。据统计，今年各机关下放到基层参加为时一年左右劳动锻炼的干部，共有六千六百多人。除此以外，还组织了全体在职干部，短期参加人民大会堂、密云水库、首都郊区绿化工程等各项建设；有的机关轮流抽调干部下乡下厂，当社员当工人；有的在农忙季节抽调干部支援首都郊区农民，进行抗旱、抗涝、抢收、抢种；大多数机关还建立了自己的副业生产基地，轮流派去干部开展养猪、种菜等副业生产。通过这一系列的生产建设活动，广大干部普遍在体力劳动中受到了锻炼。今年在继续跃进中和庆祝建国十周年的活动中，机关的任务虽然空前繁重，但是干部参加体力劳动锻炼的时间，平均仍然超过了一个月。
    许多机关的领导干部从繁忙的工作中挤出时间，带头参加体力劳动，并且在深入基层参加劳动时解决了许多实际问题，改进了领导作风。卫生部副部长徐运北到湖南省湘阳县汨罗公社当社员时，白天劳动，夜晚参加防汛战斗，深夜冒雨同群众一起在大堤上巡查，使当地群众受到很大鼓舞。在劳动的空隙，徐运北同志还在这个公社调查了许多公共食堂，访问了一些病人，和许多中西医务人员进行了座谈。在广泛深入调查的基础上写出“汨罗公社卫生工作情况报告”，提出了公社化以后农村卫生工作中急需解决的一些问题。财政部副部长吴波，化工部部长彭涛、副部长萧桂昌和劳动部副部长刘子久等领导干部，分别到人民公社和工厂中去当社员、当工人时，和工农群众同吃、同住、同劳动，还把参加体力劳动和深入基层视察工作结合起来，从群众的创造性劳动中吸取经验，发现问题，丰富了领导思想。
    广大干部在劳动中，表现非常积极热情，都认为自己能作一个“普通劳动者”是最大的光荣。在人民大会堂工地参加短期义务劳动的中央国家机关干部，有八百一十七人被评为工地劳动积极分子，受到工地总指挥部的奖励。各机关的干部还在这个工地上广泛地展开了工地服务活动，他们利用休息时间为建筑工人代写书信、缝补衣服、讲解时事、教识字，举行了三百七十二次慰问演出，服务活动共达二十多项，受到工人热烈的欢迎。冶金部、一机部、煤炭部、农业部、建筑工程部等十多个单位轮流前往支援密云水库建设工程的四千多干部，虽然每批劳动的时间不超过一个月，但广大干部也都以工地为家，在劳动中先后提出合理化建议八千多件，并且每次都大大地提前超额完成工地指挥部所分配的任务。
    经过和广大工农群众同吃、同住、同劳动，广大干部同群众建立了深厚的阶级感情。中央国家机关四十多个单位的大批干部在参加郊区麦收时，虽然每天紧张地劳动十二小时以上，有时连夜苦战，但仍然抽空为农民房东担水、扫院子，同当地农民建立了深厚友情。许多农民趁干部下地劳动时，悄悄地把花生等慰劳品塞在干部们的行李包里，临别时，农民们送出村头很远很远，恋恋不舍。一机部有一个女干部过去一直认为农民又脏又笨，见到穿得破旧一点的农民就掩鼻而过，今年她下放到农村以后，农民的冲天干劲和在生产中的创造性使她受到深刻的教育，她到农村不久就搬住到一家贫农家里，当这家贫农的妻子和小孩生病时，她白天劳动，夜间烧水、煎药，给小孩子把屎把尿，就像亲人一样照顾她们。
    许多干部还通过劳动受到了一次具体深刻的总路线教育。参加过人民大会堂建设工程的中央国家机关干部，都深刻地感到十个月建成这座巨大工程是执行总路线的结果，是多、快、好、省的范例，他们亲切地感受到工人群众集体劳动的巨大威力。许多干部参加了北京郊区抢收小麦和抢收秋菜的义务劳动以后，亲眼看到今年北京地区虽遇到几十年未有的的涝灾，不少土地几次被淹几次补种，但是仍然获得小麦丰收和秋菜的空前大丰收，因而深刻地认识到人民公社的优越性和农民的冲天干劲。不少人经过劳动回到机关以后，都订出了新的跃进规划，在工作中发挥了更大的干劲。
    通过劳动锻炼，知识分子干部脱离实际的倾向得到很大改变，许多人都体会到经常参加劳动锻炼、经常接近群众是达到又红又专的一条根本道路。冶金部、农业部、水利电力部、文化部等许多单位具有专业知识的干部下放到农村以后，都在参加农业劳动的同时传播技术和文化，在帮助人民公社兴办工业、兴修水利、建立农业中学等方面发挥了很好的作用。他们说在下边是既动嘴又动手，手脑并用，过去的“假知识”变成了“真知识”，“片面的知识”变成了“全面的知识”，因此下放锻炼不是“以红废专”，而是红专结合，在全心全意为群众服务和联系群众联系实际的基础上，更好地发挥了专业知识的作用。建筑工程部的勘探设计院有两位室主任经过劳动锻炼体会到联系群众联系实际的重要性以后，在今年研究如何提高钻井速度问题的时候，苦于没有实际经验，他们就下到工地参加劳动一个月，同工人一起共同创造了三天打一眼井和二十八天连续打九眼井的高产纪录，因此摸索到一些指导整个工作的有效经验。（附图片）
