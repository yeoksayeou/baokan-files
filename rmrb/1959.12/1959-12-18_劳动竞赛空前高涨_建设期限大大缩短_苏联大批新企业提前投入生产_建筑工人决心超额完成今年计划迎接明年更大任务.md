Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 16th: This year, the Soviet Union has achieved significant accomplishments on the industrial capital construction front. On construction sites across the country, the construction workers' enthusiasm for labor continues to rise, enabling batches of industrial and mining enterprises to be put into production one after another, strengthening the Soviet Union's industrial production capacity.

This year, the Soviet Union's capital construction tasks on the industrial front are substantial. In particularly important industrial sectors, capital construction investment has increased significantly compared to last year. This year, Soviet investment in developing the steel industry increased by 33% compared to the original plan, the chemical industry by 71%, the oil and gas industry by 23%, and the machine-building industry by approximately 40%. Although the capital construction tasks have been expanded considerably, the monthly plans have been overfulfilled, enabling many important new industrial enterprises to be put into production in a timely manner.

The four recently commissioned blast furnaces are not only the largest in the Soviet Union but also in all of Europe. The Cherepovets Steel Integrated Works, completed in early November, and the recently constructed large-scale "2800" rolling plate mill are also among the world's leading in terms of technological level. A recently completed underground coal gasification station in the Angren coal region of Uzbekistan is the largest underground gasification station in the country, capable of producing 2 billion cubic meters of gas annually. The Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station, the first hydroelectric station on the Angara River in Siberia, has recently been fully completed. This hydroelectric station has a power generation capacity of 600,000 kilowatts and is currently the largest hydroelectric station in Asia.

Thanks to the unprecedented rise in the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of construction workers, inspired by the Seven-Year Plan, the construction period of many industrial and mining enterprises in the Soviet Union has been greatly shortened this year, and the construction speed has accelerated significantly compared to the past. For example, the New Krivoy Rog Mining and Beneficiation Integrated Enterprise, newly built in the Krivoy Rog iron ore region of Ukraine, was originally scheduled to be completed in three years and four months. However, due to the enthusiastic labor emulation carried out by the 4,000 young construction workers participating in the construction project of this Communist Youth League shock work site, it was completed in only two years and two months. The "Red Army Coal Mine Construction Trust" in Donbass newly built a coal mine with an annual output of over one million tons this year. The coal mine was originally scheduled to be completed in 1960, but after the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the workers decided to shorten the construction period by one year. Thanks to overfulfilling the task every month, it was completed in mid-November this year. The Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station was originally scheduled to install five turbine units this year, but nine units had already been installed by early November. In November, the Tashkent Large-Panel Housing Construction Integrated Factory was completed in the Uzbek Republic. This factory is one of the largest factories of its kind in the Soviet Union, and its construction speed broke the highest record in the Uzbek Republic. In the Lithuanian Republic, the largest Kaunas Hydroelectric Station in the entire republic has recently begun generating electricity, and it was put into production one year ahead of schedule.

While striving to overfulfill this year's capital construction tasks, the basic construction workers on the Soviet industrial front are actively preparing for even greater tasks next year.

In 1960, Soviet investment in national economic construction will increase by another 11% compared to this year. Among them, investment in the chemical industry will increase by 30%, the steel industry by 20%, the oil and gas industry by 15%, and the machine-building industry by approximately 30%. The capital construction tasks have been further expanded, but the workers' determination is even greater. They guarantee to make greater achievements in the second year of the Seven-Year Plan.

    劳动竞赛空前高涨　建设期限大大缩短
    苏联大批新企业提前投入生产
    建筑工人决心超额完成今年计划迎接明年更大任务
    新华社莫斯科16日电　今年以来，苏联工业基本建设战线上已经取得了重大成就。在全国各地建设工地上，建筑工人的劳动热情不断高涨，已使一批批的工矿企业先后投入生产，壮大了苏联工业的生产能力。
    今年，苏联工业战线上的基本建设任务很大，在特别重要的工业部门中，基本建设投资额都比去年增加了很多。今年苏联用来发展钢铁工业的投资比原订的计划增加了33％，化学工业比原订计划增加了71％，石油和瓦斯工业比原订计划增加了23％，机器制造工业比原订计划增加了约40％。基本建设任务虽然扩大了许多，但是，每月都能超额完成计划，使许多新的重要工业企业及时投入生产。
    最近陆续投入生产的四座高炉不仅在苏联而且在全欧洲都是最大的。11月初建成的切列波维茨钢铁联合工厂和最近建成的“二八○○”号轧制钢板的大型轧机，就技术水平说在全世界也名列前茅。在乌兹别克的煤仓——安格列煤区新近落成的一座地下煤气化站，是全国最大的地下煤气站，它每年能生产二十亿立方米的瓦斯。西伯利亚安加拉河上的第一座水电站——伊尔库次克水电站已经在最近全部建成，这座水电站发电能力为六十万瓩，是目前亚洲最大的水电站。
    由于广大建设工人的劳动热情在七年计划鼓舞下空前高涨，今年苏联各地许多工矿企业的建设期限大为缩短，建设速度比过去加快许多。例如，在乌克兰的克里沃罗格铁矿区新建成的新克里沃罗格采矿选矿联合企业，原定三年零四个月建成。但是，由于参加这个共青团突击工地的建设工程的四千名青年建设者，开展了热烈的劳动竞赛，结果只用了二年零二个月时间就建成了。顿巴斯“红军煤矿建设托拉斯”今年新建成了一座年产一百万吨以上的煤井，这座煤井原定1960年完工，但是苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会以后，工人们决定把建设期限缩短一年，由于每月都超额完成任务，结果在今年11月中就全部建成了。斯大林格勒水电站今年原定安装五个涡轮机组，但在11月初就已安装好了九台。乌兹别克共和国在11月间建成了塔什干大块房屋建筑板材联合工厂，这座工厂是全苏联最大的同类型工厂之一，它的建设速度打破了乌兹别克共和国的最高纪录。在立陶宛共和国，全共和国最大的考那斯水电站已经在最近开始发电，它投入生产的时间比原定计划提前了一年。
    苏联工业战线上的基本建设工人一方面在努力超额完成今年的基本建设任务，另一方面又在积极迎接明年更大的任务。
    1960年，苏联的国民经济建设投资比今年又要增加11％。其中，化学工业部门的投资将增加30％，钢铁工业部门将增加20％，石油和瓦斯工业将增加15％，机器制造工业将增加约30％。基本建设任务进一步扩大了，但是工人的决心更大，他们保证在七年计划第二年作出更大成绩。
