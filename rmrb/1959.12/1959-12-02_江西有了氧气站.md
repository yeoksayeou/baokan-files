Jiangxi Now Has an Oxygen Station

    The newly built oxygen station of the Jiangxi Casting and Forging Plant was put into operation on November 29. Construction of this oxygen station began in October of this year, and it took only fifty-one days from construction to installation.
    In the past, the oxygen used for industrial production and medical treatment in Jiangxi Province mainly relied on supplies from East China and Wuhan. After this oxygen station is put into production, the oxygen produced daily will be able to meet the needs of industrial production and medical units throughout the province.

    江西有了氧气站
    江西铸锻厂新建氧气站已在十一月二十九日投入生产。这个氧气站是在今年十月间开始建设的，从土建到安装只用了五十一天。
    过去，江西省工业生产和医疗用的氧气，主要依靠华东地区和武汉等地供应。这座氧气站投入生产后，每天生产的氧气将可满足目前全省工业生产和医疗单位的需要。
