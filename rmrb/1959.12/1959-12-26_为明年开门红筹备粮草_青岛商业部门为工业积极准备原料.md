　　Preparing Resources for a Good Start Next Year
    Qingdao Commercial Departments Actively Prepare Raw Materials for Industry
    (Our Dispatch) Qingdao's commercial workers are greatly exerting their energy and actively making various preparations for achieving a good start next year.

    In order to support the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production next year, all commercial units in the city first arranged their purchasing and sales plans for the first quarter of next year based on the needs of industrial and agricultural production development next year. According to the plan requirements, they actively began to arrange production and organize sources of goods. For example, regarding the materials needed for large-scale farmland water conservancy and agricultural production next year, relevant wholesale stations have gone deep into various counties and water conservancy construction sites for further investigation and research. Based on the investigation, they actively arranged production under the unified planning of the city. In arranging production, relevant wholesale departments actively assisted industrial departments in increasing equipment and improving production capacity to increase the source of goods. Commercial departments in various counties and districts continued to implement the policy of relying on the masses, obtaining materials locally, producing locally, and supplying locally, and have organized county-run and handicraft industries to produce more than 60,000 iron shovels, picks, sledgehammers, and other tools such as baskets and hampers. In addition, in order to provide technical assistance for farmland water conservancy, the electrical appliance stations are using training classes to impart tire repair technology and basic electrical knowledge to some rural commercial cadres and commune members. Some stations have also recently selected some people's communes as base points to assist them in solving problems in terms of materials and technology, in order to gain experience and guide the general work.

    In order to support industrial production for a "good start" next year, wholesale departments, led by their leaders, are actively conducting production arrangements and preparing and supplying raw materials by going deep into factories to understand production conditions. The hardware station has arranged 70% of the products for the first quarter of next year, and other stations have also fully balanced the first-quarter plan with the industrial departments.

    In terms of raw material preparation, all units have actively conducted inventory checks, prioritizing the allocation of raw materials in stock to factories. For raw materials that cannot meet production needs, personnel are being sent to various places to expedite deliveries. The cotton, tobacco, and hemp station, in coordination with the industrial departments, is led by the manager in expediting the delivery of cotton and flue-cured tobacco in various producing areas, preparing sufficient resources for the light industry and textile industry next year. The hardware station is actively organizing the processing of some steel that needs to be processed and deformed, preparing raw materials for products such as iron wire, round nails, and shoe nails. All units also plan to continue to make extensive use of local steel and iron next year to produce iron shovels, picks, round saw blades, trolley parts, and small construction hardware products. In addition, the commercial departments also plan to carry out an internal "one-stop" competition of purchasing, sales, allocation, transportation, and storage, gradually balancing the supply of raw materials; and through this method, promote the industrial departments to achieve balanced production next year, reversing the phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning of the month and quarter and tight at the end of the month and quarter.

　　为明年开门红筹备粮草
    青岛商业部门为工业积极准备原料
    本报讯　青岛市商业职工，正大鼓干劲，积极为实现明年开门红做好各种准备。
    为了支援明年工农业生产继续跃进，全市各商业单位首先根据明年工农业生产发展的需要，安排了明年第一季度购销计划，并根据计划要求，积极着手安排生产和组织货源。如对明年大兴农田水利和农业生产所需要的物资，有关批发站已分别深入各县区和水利工地进一步进行了调查摸底，并根据调查摸底情况，在市统一规划下，积极安排生产。在安排生产中，有关批发部门都积极从协助工业部门增加设备、提高生产能力入手，增加货源。各县区商业部门继续贯彻依靠群众，就地取材，就地生产，就地供应的方针，已组织县社工业和手工业生产了六万多件铁锨、洋镐、大锤以及其它工具如筐、篓等。此外，为对农田水利进行技术援助，交电站正在以训练班的形式，对部分农村商业干部和社员传授修补车胎技术和电工基础知识。有的站还在最近选定了一些人民公社作为基点，协助他们解决物资、技术等方面的问题，以便取得经验，指导一般。
    为支援工业生产明年“开门红”，各批发部门在领导带动下，正通过深入工厂了解生产情况，积极地进行生产安排和原材料的准备和供应工作。五金站对明年第一季度产品已安排了70％，其它各站也与工业部门全面平衡了第一季度计划。
    在原材料准备上，各单位都积极进行了清仓排队，把库存有货的原材物料尽先拨给工厂，不能满足生产需要的原材料，正派出人员分赴各地催调催运。棉烟麻站在工业部门配合下，以经理为首，正在各产地催调催运棉花和烤烟，为明年的轻工业、纺织工业准备充足的粮草。五金站对一些需要加工变型的钢材，正积极组织加工，为铁丝、元钉、鞋钉等产品准备原料。各单位还计划明年继续大量利用土钢土铁，生产铁锨、洋镐、元锯片、推车零件和建筑小五金等产品。此外，商业部门还计划开展内部的进、销、调、运、存一条龙竞赛，逐步使原材料供应达到均衡；并通过这个办法促进工业部门明年达到均衡生产，扭转过去那种月初、季初松，月末、季末紧的现象。
