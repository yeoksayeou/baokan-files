Xinhua News Agency Report: The Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Range Forestry Bureau has completed its annual plans for timber production, forest regeneration, and financial remittances ahead of schedule. As of December 10th, timber production had reached 107.8% of the annual plan, a 28.9% increase compared to the same period last year; the area of forest regeneration operations exceeded the area of logging during the same period.

This year, forestry workers of all ethnic groups in the Greater Khingan Range have continuously opposed Rightist tendencies and boosted their energy, achieving significant accomplishments in forestry production. The Xiniqi Forestry Bureau, a red banner unit that attended the National "Conference of Heroes," overcame Rightist complacency early on and completed its annual plans for timber production and forest regeneration five months ahead of schedule. Encouraged by the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, forestry workers overcame the numerous difficulties of rainy and muddy forest areas, and the effects of mosquito bites on timber production efficiency, putting forward the slogan of "hard work in rainy days, all-out efforts in rainless days" and launching a production increase and conservation campaign. Since entering winter, they have overcome the difficulties of severe cold and knee-deep snow, and fought a great battle in the "golden season," resulting in steadily increasing timber production. Various forestry bureaus vigorously promoted the experience of concentrating the wisdom and resources of the masses for a certain period to organize a production peak about twice as high as normal. This year, the Ke Yi River Forestry Bureau organized a production peak every five days, and only thirty-two peaks (one day each) completed 29% of the annual timber production plan, which promoted the bureau to complete the annual timber production plan one hundred and three days ahead of schedule. This year, the various forestry bureaus universally implemented the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" enterprise management system, which greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff in managing production.

With the early completion of the timber production plan, the increase production and conservation campaign has been widely and deeply carried out, labor productivity has been greatly improved, and costs have been reduced.

This year, the forest area further overcame the "stressing logging and neglecting regeneration" thinking of some cadres, and implemented the policy of "giving equal importance to logging and regeneration" determined by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee last year. Forestry workers and the masses have established the idea that "relying on the mountains to eat from the mountains requires nurturing the mountains, so that the forests will last forever," and have launched a mass forest regeneration campaign, which has led to the area of regeneration operations exceeding the area of logging during the same period, reversing the past situation where regeneration could not keep up with logging.

    木材生产和森林更新全面跃进
    内蒙古大兴安岭林业管理局提前完成年计划
    据新华社讯　内蒙古大兴安岭林业管理局木材生产、森林更新、上缴财务等全年计划已经提前完成。到12月10日止，木材生产完成全年计划107.8％，比去年同期增长28.9％；森林更新作业面积超过了同期采伐面积。
    大兴安岭各族林业职工今年不断反右倾、鼓干劲，取得了林业生产上的重大成就。出席全国“群英会”的红旗单位——西尼气林业局。由于及早克服右倾松劲情绪，提前五个月就完成了全年木材生产、森林更新等计划。林业职工在党的八届八中全会号召鼓舞下，克服林区阴雨路泞、蚊虻叮咬影响木材生产效率的重重困难，提出“雨天苦战，无雨大干”的口号，开展了增产节约竞赛。入冬以来，他们又克服严寒和雪深没膝的困难，大战“黄金季节”，使木材产量节节上升。各林业局大力推广了在一定时期集中群众智慧和物力组织一次比平日产量高一倍左右的生产高峰的经验。克一河林业局今年每五天组织一次生产高峰，仅三十二次（每次一天）高峰就完成全年木材生产计划29％，推动了全局提前一百零三天完成了全年木材生产计划。各林业局今年普遍推行“两参一改三结合”的企业管理制度，广大职工群众管理生产的积极性大大提高。
    随着木材生产计划提前完成，增产节约运动广泛深入开展，劳动生产率大大提高，成本降低。
    今年林区进一步克服了某些干部的“重采伐轻更新”思想，贯彻执行了内蒙古自治区党委去年确定的“采伐和更新并举”的方针。林区职工和群众树立“靠山吃山必须养山，使森林万古长青”的思想，掀起了群众性森林更新运动，使更新作业面积超过同期采伐面积，扭转了过去更新跟不上采伐的局面。
