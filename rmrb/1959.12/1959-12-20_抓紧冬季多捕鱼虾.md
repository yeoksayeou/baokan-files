November is the peak season for winter fishing in Fujian. In order to strengthen leadership, Party committees at all levels in the fishing areas held various meetings in advance, improved their administrative organizations, and many responsible cadres went deep into the fishing areas to lead production. Since the end of the typhoon in late September, the vast number of fishermen, under the leadership of the local Party committees, have been repairing their boats day and night. As a result, more than a quarter of the new fishing boats were put into operation this winter fishing season, and the number of boats going to sea increased by about 10% compared with last year. Fishermen in Pingtan County, in the fishing area, worked hard to go to sea and cast more nets during this winter fishing season. In late November, under the leadership of the First Secretary of the Party Committee, they launched a "daily production of 30,000 dan of aquatic products" campaign involving 40,000 people. By November 24th, the county had produced more than 1.4 million dan of various aquatic products, successfully overfulfilling the annual task 37 days ahead of schedule. Fishermen of the Haixiong Brigade of the Shen Tu Commune in Zhangpu slept in bamboo sheds by the sea, ensuring that they pushed their boats into the sea as soon as the tide rose. With the help of advanced units, their daily output increased from 400 jin to 600 jin.
    While vigorously developing marine fishery production, all production units also mobilized coastal farmers and fishermen to carry out a small-scale aquatic production campaign. About 200,000 laborers in the province participated in catching small aquatic products. Longtian Commune in Fuqing organized 330 laborers to collect small sea products, and in ten days their output reached 1,212 dan, worth 16,000 yuan, with an average income of 30 to 40 yuan per laborer.
    November is also the season for harvesting freshwater fish in Fujian. While vigorously developing marine production, various places in the province also carried out freshwater fishing.

    抓紧冬季多捕鱼虾
    11月份，是福建冬汛旺产季节。为了加强领导，渔区各级党委都事先召开了各种会议，健全了办公机构，不少负责干部深入渔区领导生产。广大渔民从9月下旬台风过去以后，在当地党委的领导下，日夜赶修船只，因此今年冬汛生产中有四分之一以上新渔船，出海船只比去年增加10％左右。渔区平潭县渔民在今年的冬汛中，作到勤出海、多下网，11月下旬由党委第一书记挂帅，开展四万人上阵的“水产日产三万担”运动。全县到11月24日止，即生产各种水产品一百四十万多担，提前三十七天胜利超额完成全年任务。漳浦深土公社海雄大队渔民在海边搭竹篷睡觉，做到了潮水刚涨起就推船下海，在先进单位帮助下，日产量由四百斤提高到六百斤。
    各生产单位在大搞海洋渔业生产的同时，还发动沿海农民、渔民开展了小水产生产运动。全省参加捕捞小水产的劳力约有二十多万。福清龙田公社组织三百三十个劳力讨小海，十天产量达一千二百一十二担，价值一万六千元，每个劳力平均收入三、四十元。
    11月份也是福建淡水鱼收获的季节，省内各地在大抓海洋生产同时，还进行了淡水捕捞。
