Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 8th. "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" radio station published a commentary today stating that the Algerian people know that independence cannot be obtained through begging. The Algerian people will rely on themselves and will continue to fight until the bastion of French imperialism is smashed. The commentary attacked the United States for supporting France during the vote on the Algerian issue in the United Nations Political Committee. It said that the position of the United States and other imperialist countries on the Algerian issue clearly shows that the West, which calls itself the "free world," is against the people of Asia and Africa.

The commentary said that no American can make anyone in Asian and African countries accept the fake stuff that the United States calls "freedom."

The radio station then said that the United States vigorously supports dying French imperialism and last year threatened and bribed other countries, forcing the proposal on the Algerian issue submitted by Asian and African countries to fail to obtain the two-thirds majority required for passage in the United Nations General Assembly.

The radio station said that the whole world knows that the Western camp headed by the United States is an imperialist camp that enslaves the people of the world, and this camp is the only group in the United Nations that opposes the freedom and independence of all countries. The radio station also said that the whole world knows that France has been using NATO weapons and ammunition to fight against the Algerian people for five years. The whole world knows that without the support of the United States, France would never be able to continue this imperialist war.

    “阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台宣告
    独立不能乞求　胜利全靠自己
    美国支持法国的无耻行为证明美国的“自由”是假货
    新华社开罗8日电　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台今天发表的一篇评论说，阿尔及利亚人民知道，不能通过乞求来取得独立。阿尔及利亚人民将依靠自己，并且将继续战斗，直到把法帝国主义的堡垒打垮为止。这篇评论抨击美国在联合国政治委员会就阿尔及利亚问题投票时支持法国。它说，美国和其他帝国主义国家在阿尔及利亚问题上的立场清楚地表明，自称为“自由世界”的西方是反对亚非人民的。
    评论说，任何一个美国人都不能在亚非国家使人接受美国把它叫做“自由”的那种假货。
    电台接着说，美国大力支持垂死的法帝国主义，曾经在去年对其他国家进行威胁和贿赂，迫使亚非国家提出的关于阿尔及利亚问题的提案不能获得在联合国大会通过所需要的三分之二多数。
    电台说，全世界都知道，以美国为首的西方阵营是奴役世界人民的帝国主义阵营，这个阵营是联合国中反对各国人民自由和独立的唯一集团。电台还说，全世界都知道，五年来法国一直在用北大西洋公约组织的武器和弹药来同阿尔及利亚人民作战。全世界都知道，要不是美国的支持，法国决不能再继续这场帝国主义战争。
