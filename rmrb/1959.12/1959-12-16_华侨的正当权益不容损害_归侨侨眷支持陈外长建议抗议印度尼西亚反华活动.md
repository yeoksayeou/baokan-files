Xinhua News Agency, 15th. After the publication of Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to the Indonesian Foreign Minister regarding the Indonesian anti-Chinese incident, returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in many cities across the country held gatherings. Based on their own experiences, they explained the close friendship between overseas Chinese in Indonesia and the local people. They expressed serious protest against Indonesia's frenzied anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities and firm support for the three proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi. They also pointed out that the overseas Chinese economy had made considerable contributions to Indonesia's economic development, and it was with ulterior motives that some powerful elements in Indonesia who were hostile to China and Indonesian friendship slandered the overseas Chinese economy as a "remnant of colonialist economy." Returned overseas Chinese and their relatives in various places eagerly hoped that those overseas Chinese who had been persecuted and did not wish to continue living in Indonesia would return to the motherland and participate in the motherland's great socialist construction.

At a gathering held by returned overseas Chinese in Shanghai, Huang Qinshu, director of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that Indonesian overseas Chinese had played a beneficial role in developing the local economy, both in the past and at present. The broad masses of overseas Chinese had also contributed to resisting Dutch and Japanese imperialism's aggression against Indonesia and supporting Indonesia's national independence struggle in the past. Now, some forces in Indonesia who are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship are raising the banner of "nationalization" and unreasonably excluding and brutally persecuting overseas Chinese. This behavior cannot but arouse indignation. Jian Rilin, general manager of Nanyang Tobacco Company and a returned overseas Chinese from the United States, pointed out that the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese should be respected. The Indonesian government should, in accordance with their wishes to return to their country, send those overseas Chinese who are displaced or unwilling to continue residing in Indonesia back to their country in batches, and ensure their safety on their way back to their country. Returned overseas Chinese students studying in major universities and middle schools in Shanghai have also held gatherings in recent days to resolutely support the three proposals of Foreign Minister Chen Yi.

Returned overseas Chinese in Tianjin have held gatherings for days. Guo Guangzhen, a cadre of Tianjin Weijin Chemical Factory and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, angrily exposed the recent persecution of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. He said that in the recent anti-Chinese current, the authorities in Malang, East Java, forcibly evicted his family from their home, throwing the furniture and his father's shoemaking tools out the door. Now, the whole family can only live scattered in friends' homes, and the young siblings cry all day because they are separated from their parents. Guo Guangzhen said that if Indonesia wants to develop its national economy, it should fight against imperialist monopoly capital, not against overseas Chinese small vendors. Wu Jingmin, an assistant teacher at Tianjin Medical University and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, had lived in Medan, Sumatra, for three generations. He said that in Medan and small towns near Medan, the vast majority of shops run by overseas Chinese are family shops run by husband and wife or brothers, with meager capital and operating in small general merchandise or catering industries. Some overseas Chinese small vendors peddle daily necessities from street to street, which plays a significant role in enlivening local commodity exchange. This has nothing in common with "colonialist economy." In fact, it is imperialist monopoly capital that hinders Indonesia's economic development.

The Shanxi Provincial and Taiyuan Municipal Overseas Chinese Federations recently held enlarged meetings. Ye Yingtang, deputy director of the Taiyuan Municipal Overseas Chinese Federation who had lived in Indonesia for eighteen years, said: The people of our country and the people of Indonesia have a traditional friendship. Especially since the founding of New China, the Chinese government and people have given Indonesia great support and assistance in terms of morality and economy. We firmly oppose the recent large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities launched by some influential forces in Indonesia that undermine the friendship between the two peoples. Situ Dasheng, son of Situ Zan, chairman of the Jakarta Chinese Overseas Chinese Association, condemned the wartime authorities in Jakarta for detaining his father for no reason and infringing on the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese. He said: "My father returned to China from Jakarta in September this year to sightsee. He first returned to his hometown of Kaiping County, Guangdong Province, to see my grandmother, and then I accompanied him to visit Beijing, Qingdao, and other places. On November 16, after my father returned to Jakarta, he was detained by the local wartime authorities. What crime did my father commit? Does his love for the motherland violate Indonesian laws?" He demanded that the Indonesian authorities immediately release his father and immediately stop all anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities.

Ni Yuliu, a standing committee member of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, deputy county magistrate of Yueqing County, and a returned overseas Chinese who had lived in Indonesia for 27 years, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the 14th that the Indonesian people, like the Chinese people, had been oppressed by imperialism for a long time, and the overseas Chinese had always supported the Indonesian people's struggle for national independence. "Even many overseas Chinese sacrificed their lives in participating in the struggle against fascist rule, but now some powerful elements in Indonesia are forcing a large number of overseas Chinese to lose their livelihoods and become displaced, which makes me feel very indignant." He said: "I hope the Indonesian government cherishes the friendship between the two peoples, immediately stops anti-Chinese activities, and handles the issue of overseas Chinese through negotiations with our government."

At a gathering held by returned overseas Chinese in Xi'an, Chen Ming, chairman of the Xi'an Overseas Chinese Federation, on behalf of more than 500 returned overseas Chinese in Xi'an, strongly condemned the anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities created by a small number of reactionary elements in Indonesia. He said that the current large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia are entirely instigated by a small number of reactionary elements in Indonesia under the planning and instigation of US imperialism. This behavior not only seriously damages the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and is extremely detrimental to the friendship between the two countries, but also violates the interests of the Indonesian people. He Xiangrui of Xi'an Jiaotong University and Gao Yannuan of Xi'an Institute of Metallurgy, among others, returned from Indonesia not long ago. In their speeches, they exposed many facts of Indonesia's persecution of overseas Chinese.

At a gathering held by returned overseas Chinese in Shenyang, Yang Nansheng, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia and a technician at Shenyang Smelter, said that deep feelings had already been established between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people, and the Chinese people had always sympathized with and supported the Indonesian people's anti-imperialist struggle. It is the monopoly capital of imperialism that harms Indonesia's economic development, not overseas Chinese small vendors. The legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese must be respected.

Returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students from various agencies, factories, mines, and schools in Wuhan also held gatherings. Huang Zhihong, a member of the Hubei Provincial Overseas Chinese Federation, said: "The hard work of overseas Chinese in Indonesia has played a great role in Indonesia's prosperity. Today, Indonesia is rudely discriminating against and persecuting overseas Chinese, which is contrary to justice and reason." Wang Wenru, a representative of returned overseas Chinese students from Hubei University, said: "In the forced relocation of overseas Chinese in West Java, Indonesia, troops were dispatched and shots were fired, causing bloodshed and even unreasonably restricting the legitimate activities of our diplomatic personnel. This makes us returned overseas Chinese students feel very indignant. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's protest and three proposals." Hou? Xin, chairman of the Wuhan Overseas Chinese Federation, on behalf of the city's returned overseas Chinese, warmly welcomed overseas Chinese who were displaced or unwilling to live in Indonesia to return to the motherland to participate in the great socialist construction.

Returned overseas Chinese and their relatives in Dalian, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Jinan, Harbin, Changsha, Handan, and other places have also held gatherings in recent days, resolutely supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's proposal on comprehensively resolving the overseas Chinese issue and strongly condemning the large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities launched by some influential forces in Indonesia.

    华侨的正当权益不容损害
    归侨侨眷支持陈外长建议抗议印度尼西亚反华活动
    新华社15日讯　陈毅外交部长就印度尼西亚排华事件写给印度尼西亚外交部长的信件公布以后，全国许多城市的归国华侨、华侨眷属和归国华侨学生纷纷举行集会。他们以自己的亲身经历说明了在印度尼西亚的华侨同当地人民存在着亲密友谊，他们对印度尼西亚疯狂的反华排华活动表示严重抗议，对陈毅外交部长所提出的三点建议表示坚决支持。他们还指出当地华侨经济对印度尼西亚的经济发展作出了不少的贡献，印度尼西亚一部分敌视我国和印度尼西亚友谊的有势力分子，诬蔑华侨经济是“殖民主义经济残余”是别有用心的。各地的归侨和侨眷热切盼望那些受到迫害和不愿继续留居在印度尼西亚的华侨返回祖国，参加祖国伟大的社会主义建设。
    在上海市归侨举行的集会上，上海市侨联主任、印度尼西亚归侨黄钦书说，印度尼西亚华侨对发展当地经济，无论过去、现在，都起着有益的作用。广大华侨在过去抗击荷兰和日本帝国主义对印度尼西亚的侵略、支援印度尼西亚民族独立斗争方面也作出了贡献。现在印度尼西亚的一部分敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力竟打起“民族化”的幌子，对华侨进行无理的排斥和蛮横的迫害，这种行为使人不能不感到愤慨。南洋烟草公司总经理、美国归侨简日林指出，华侨的正当权利和利益应当受到尊重。那些流离失所或不愿继续在印度尼西亚居留的华侨，印度尼西亚政府应当根据他们回国的志愿，分期分批遣送他们回国，并保证他们在回国途中的安全，在上海各大中学校学习的归国华侨学生连日来也纷纷集会，坚决拥护陈毅外交部长的三点建议。
    天津市的归侨连日都举行了集会。天津卫津化工厂干部、印度尼西亚归侨郭光振愤怒地揭露了印度尼西亚最近迫害华侨的事实。他说，在最近排华的逆流中，东爪哇玛琅当局用暴力强迫他的一家离开自己的住宅，把家具和他父亲的做鞋工具扔出门外。现在，全家只好散居在朋友家里，年幼的弟妹因离开父母，整日啼哭。郭光振说，印度尼西亚要发展国民经济，应该向帝国主义垄断资本斗争，而不应当向华侨小商贩开刀。天津医科大学助教、印度尼西亚归侨伍敬民三代都居住在苏门答腊的棉兰市。他说，在棉兰市和棉兰附近的小市镇，华侨开办的商店绝大多数是夫妻或兄弟合营的家庭商店，资金微薄，经营小百货或饮食业，有的华侨小商贩串街走巷经营日用品，对活跃当地商品交流起了很大作用。这与“殖民主义经济”没有任何共同之处。事实上，妨碍印度尼西亚经济发展的是帝国主义垄断资本。
    山西省和太原市侨联近日举行了扩大会议，曾在印度尼西亚侨居了十八年的太原市侨联副主任叶应塘说：我国人民同印度尼西亚人民有着传统的友谊，特别是新中国成立以来，我国政府和人民曾经在道义上和经济上给予印度尼西亚很大的支持和帮助。我们坚决反对印度尼西亚一部分有影响的势力最近掀起的破坏两国人民友谊的大规模的反华排华活动。雅加达中华侨团总会主席司徒赞的儿子司徒达生，在会上谴责雅加达战时掌权者无故扣押他的父亲、侵犯华侨正当权利的行为。他说：“今年9月我父亲从雅加达回国观光，先回到家乡广东省开平县看了我的祖母，以后我又陪他到北京、青岛等地观光。11月16日，我父亲回到雅加达以后，就被当地战时掌权者扣留了。我父亲犯了什么罪？难道他热爱祖国就违犯了印度尼西亚的法令吗？”他要求印度尼西亚当局立即释放他的父亲，立即停止一切反华排华活动。
    政协浙江省委常务委员、乐清县副县长、曾在印度尼西亚居住二十七年之久的归侨倪玉柳，14日向新华社记者说，印度尼西亚人民在过去的长时期中和中国人民一样，受着帝国主义的压迫，华侨一贯支持印度尼西亚人民的民族独立斗争，“甚至有不少华侨在参加反法西斯统治斗争中献出了自己的生命，可是现在印度尼西亚一部分有势力的分子竟逼使大批华侨丧失生计，流离失所，这真使我感到非常愤慨。”他说：“我希望印度尼西亚政府珍惜两国人民的友谊，立即停止排华，和我国政府通过谈判处理华侨问题。”
    在西安市归侨举行的集会上，西安市侨联主席陈明代表西安市五百多名归国华侨，强烈谴责印度尼西亚少数反动分子制造的排华反华活动。他说，目前印度尼西亚大规模的排华反华活动，完全是印度尼西亚一部分反动分子在美帝国主义的策划和煽动下搞起来的。这种行为不仅严重损害了华侨的正当权利和利益，极其不利于两国的友谊，也违反了印度尼西亚人民的利益。西安交通大学何祥瑞、西安冶金学院高炎暖等人，都是不久以前从印度尼西亚回国的。他们在发言中揭露了印度尼西亚迫害华侨的许多事实。
    在沈阳归国华侨举行的集会上，印度尼西亚归侨、沈阳冶炼厂技术员杨南生说，华侨和印度尼西亚人民之间已经建立了深厚感情，中国人民一贯同情和支持印度尼西亚人民的反帝斗争。损害印度尼西亚经济发展的是帝国主义的垄断资本，而不是华侨小商贩。华侨的正当权利和利益，必须受到尊重。
    武汉市各机关、厂矿和学校的归侨和归国华侨学生也举行了集会。湖北省侨联委员黄志宏说：“印度尼西亚华侨的艰辛劳动，对印度尼西亚的繁荣起了很大作用。今天印度尼西亚竟粗暴地歧视和迫害华侨，这是违背正义和公理的。”湖北大学归侨学生代表王文儒说：“印度尼西亚西爪哇一带在强迫华侨迁居中，竟出动军队并鸣枪射击，造成流血事件，甚至无理限制我外交人员的正当活动。这使我们归国华侨学生感到非常愤慨，我们坚决支持陈毅外长的抗议和三点建议。”武汉市侨联主席侯?新代表全市归侨热烈欢迎流离失所或不愿在印度尼西亚居住的华侨，回到祖国来参加伟大的社会主义建设。
    旅大、南昌、杭州、南京、济南、哈尔滨、长沙、邯郸等地的归国华侨和侨眷，也在近日举行了集会，坚决拥护陈毅外交部长关于全面解决华侨问题的建议，并强烈谴责印度尼西亚一部分有影响的势力所掀起的大规模反华排华活动。（附图片）
