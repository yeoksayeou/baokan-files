    Polish Writers' Association Holds Congress
    Jaroszewicz Calls for Promoting Socialist Spirit to Transform Social Consciousness

    (Dispatch from our newspaper) According to the Polish "People's Tribune," the Polish Writers' Association held its tenth congress in Warsaw from December 3rd to 5th. The congress was attended by seventy-eight delegates elected from twelve writers' association branches, as well as some writers attending as observers. The congress discussed the work of the Writers' Association over the past three years and current issues in the literary world.

    Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jaroszewicz delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress on behalf of the government. Jaroszewicz said that in the past fifteen years, in the struggle to promote Poland's progressive development and to transform social consciousness with the socialist spirit, Polish literature has created many valuable works of art and literature. After discussing the twists and turns encountered in Poland's socialist construction and the difficulties encountered in cultural policy in the past, he called on writers to fight against the negative phenomena arising from reactionary and conservative political tendencies. He also called on writers to oppose selfishness, greed and other old remnants, to oppose ignorance, to oppose "oddities" such as the "strange affair" of the church on Nowolipki Street in Warsaw, and to combat the philistine prejudices that poison the lives of honest people in urban and rural areas and hinder the development of the younger generation. He said that the vast area of relations between people needs the pen of writers and poets, and this area should be transformed with the spirit of socialism and humanism.

    The congress heard Żukrowski's report entitled "Writers and Society" and conducted discussions. Finally, a new leadership of the Writers' Association was elected. The newly elected chairman of the Writers' Association is Iwaszkiewicz, and a council consisting of fourteen members was also elected.

    波兰作家协会举行代表大会
    雅罗谢维奇号召发扬社会主义精神改造社会意识
    本报讯　据波兰“人民论坛报”消息，波兰作家协会于12月3日至5日在华沙召开了第十次代表大会，参加会议的有十二个作家协会分会选出的七十八位代表和一些列席作家。代表大会讨论了作家协会三年来的工作和目前文学界的问题。
    波兰部长会议副主席雅罗谢维奇代表政府向大会致了祝词。雅罗谢维奇说，在过去十五年内，在争取波兰进步的发展，争取用社会主义精神改造社会意识的斗争过程中，波兰文学创造出很多有价值的文艺作品。他在谈到波兰社会主义建设遇到的波折和过去在文化政策方面遇到的困难后，号召作家同产生于反动的、保守的政治倾向的消极现象斗争。他还号召作家反对自私、贪财等旧残余，反对愚昧，反对类似华沙诺沃利普基大街教堂的“异事”一类的“异事”，并同毒化城乡正直人的生活和妨碍青年一代发展的市侩偏见作斗争。他说，人们之间的关系的巨大领域需要作家和诗人的笔，这个领域应当以社会主义和人道主义的精神来改造。
    代表大会听取了茹凯夫斯基以“作家和社会”为题的报告，并进行了讨论。最后选出了作家协会新的领导机构。新选出的作家协会主席是伊瓦什凯维奇，另外选出由十四人组成的理事会。
