　　A Measure to Save National Foreign Exchange
    Philippines Decides to Restrict Remittances by Foreign Technical Personnel
    According to a report in the "Manila Daily Bulletin" on the 13th, the Central Bank of the Philippines has decided to cut foreign exchange remittances by foreign technical personnel and employees in the Philippines by half starting next January as a further measure to save national foreign exchange.
    The report said that foreign technical personnel and employees remit nearly $2.5 million in salaries earned in the Philippines abroad each year.
    The American Chamber of Commerce in Manila recently wrote to the Monetary Bureau of the Central Bank of the Philippines to protest the decision.
    Philippine Labor Minister Castaño said at the end of November that no foreign technical personnel should be allowed to enter the Philippines without prior approval from the Department of Labor.

　　节约国家外汇的一个措施
    菲决定限制外国技术人员汇款
    据“马尼拉日报”13日报道，菲律宾中央银行决定从明年1月起把在菲律宾的外国技术人员和雇员的外汇汇款削减一半，作为进一步节约国家外汇的一个措施。
    消息说，外国技术人员和雇员每年把他们在菲律宾所挣的薪金汇往国外的将近二百五十万美元。
    马尼拉美国商会最近写信给菲律宾中央银行货币局对这个决定提出抗议。
    菲律宾劳工部长卡斯塔诺在11月底曾经说，除非得到劳工部的事先批准，不应当准许任何外国技术人员进入菲律宾。
