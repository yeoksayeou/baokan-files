Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 5th: The Fourth Congress of the Artists' Association of the German Democratic Republic was held in Leipzig from December 1st to 5th. The congress unanimously passed a resolution calling on all artists to devote their full efforts to participating in the great movement to complete the Seven-Year Plan and promoting the surge of socialist victory.

One hundred and fifty art representatives from various regions, along with representatives of workers, peasants, and soldiers invited to attend the meeting, discussed how artists could further deepen their involvement in factories and agricultural enterprises and further strengthen their ties with workers and peasants. The congress also discussed the issues of artists studying Marxism-Leninism and Marxist aesthetics, and using socialist realism for creation. The meeting unanimously emphasized the necessity of learning from the Soviet Union in this regard. In his report, the chairman of the Artists' Association, Wolf Grehm, called for developing the current relationship between artists and socialist worker-peasant enterprises into a movement of "artists and the people united as one." Bei Luoite, the secretary of the Central Council of the Free German Trade Union Federation, suggested at the meeting that artists go to factories more often to tutor amateur art groups, so that they become members of "socialist labor teams." He demanded that every enterprise have an artist.

Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, wrote a congratulatory letter to the congress on behalf of the Party Central Committee. The letter stated that in the flourishing period of socialist construction, the task of artists is to inspire the people to recognize truth, goodness, and beauty, and to help the new socialist people improve their aesthetic abilities. Artists should draw inspiration from the people's new attitude towards life and the new relationships between people in state-owned enterprises and agricultural production cooperatives.

Ulbricht also said in his letter that art that draws inspiration from the working class can only succeed when using socialist realism methods. Therefore, socialist artists should combine critically studying the national traditions in German realist art with learning the socialist realist art developed by the Soviet Union.

    德意志民主共和国举行美协代表大会
    号召美术家和人民结成一体
    乌布利希在贺信中指出应启发人民识别真善美
    新华社柏林5日电　德意志民主共和国美术家协会第四次代表大会1日到5日在来比锡举行。大会一致通过决议，号召所有的美术家竭尽全力参加到完成七年计划的伟大运动和促成社会主义胜利的激流中去。
    来自各地的一百五十名艺术界代表和应邀参加会议的工、农、兵代表一道，讨论了美术家如何进一步深入到工农企业中去，进一步加强同工农的关系的问题。大会还讨 论了美术家学习马克思列宁主义和马克思主义美学、运用社会主义现实主义进行创作的问题。会议一致强调在这方面向苏联学习的必要性。美术家协会主席沃尔夫格雷姆在报告中要求把美术家同社会主义工农企业现在的关系发展成一个“美术家和人民结成一体”的运动。自由德国工会联合会中央理事会书记处书记拜罗伊特在会上建议美术家们更多地到工厂去辅导业余美术小组，使自己成为“社会主义劳动队”的一员。他要求让每一个企业都有一个美术家。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希代表党中央给大会写了一封贺信。贺信中说，在欣欣向荣的社会主义建设时期，美术家的任务是启发人民识别真善美，帮助社会主义新人提高审美能力。美术家应当从人民对生活的新的态度以及国营企业和农业生产合作社中人与人之间的新的关系中吸取灵感。
    乌布利希在信中还说，从工人阶级中吸取灵感的艺术，只有使用社会主义现实主义方法时才能成功。因此，社会主义美术家应当把批判地研究德国现实主义艺术中的民族传统同学习苏联所发展的社会主义现实主义艺术结合起来。
