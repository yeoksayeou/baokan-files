Many people now understand the importance of combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis. However, scientific analysis must be scientific; analysis that is not scientific still cannot achieve the goal of grasping objective laws.

The events that occurred at the Yunnan Printing and Dyeing Factory during the trial of the "Cyclical Continuous Pot Boiling Method" for cloth is one example. Some people's analysis concluded that this method had a scientific basis, could solve key problems in production, and should be tested and promoted; others analyzed that it would cause steam pipe explosions and overturn the cloth-boiling pot, "making it dangerous." Later, when the first trial encountered setbacks, some analyzed that it was due to a lack of experience and not a defect of the new cloth-boiling method, and that the experiment should be continued; others analyzed that the trial was in vain and should not be tried again. Look: the same thing, analyzed by different people, actually led to such different conclusions. Who is right and who is wrong? There is only one truth. The results of practical testing show that the former's analysis was truly scientific, and the "Cyclical Continuous Pot Boiling Method" was indeed successful, achieving the expected results; the latter's analysis was not scientific, the steam pipe did not explode, the cloth-boiling pot did not overturn, and there was no "danger" at all. The former group was the factory leadership, the Party branch secretary of the workshop, and the vast majority of workers and technicians; the latter group was a small number of people with right-leaning conservative ideas.

Similar things can be cited many times.

Why do different people come to such different conclusions when analyzing the same thing? One of the reasons is that some people see the whole picture, while others only see the part; some people see the mainstream, while others only see the tributaries. The ideological method is one-sided, so the analysis of the problem is of course impossible to be scientific. In addition to this ideological reason, it can also be traced back to more profound reasons. In the field of class struggle, standing on different class positions leads to completely different views on issues. For example, bourgeois social scientists can never scientifically explain social development, only proletarian social scientists can scientifically explain social development, and point out the inevitable trend of social development. The same is true in our production struggle. Only those who have soaring enthusiasm, have full enthusiasm for new things, and have mastered certain scientific and technological knowledge or have certain practical experience, can make a truly scientific analysis of new problems in production and guide the development of production based on this analysis. People with right-leaning ideas, people with insufficient enthusiasm, although they also talk about "scientific analysis" in words, and even prefer to use the term "scientific analysis," they are skeptics of new things, they are wearing gray glasses to "scientifically analyze," so the result of the analysis is always unscientific.

This is a very beneficial experience. Scientific analysis is extremely important. From the entire situation to the reform of a tool, scientific analysis must be carried out. Without scientific analysis, the laws of things cannot be grasped. Scientific analysis is the weapon of revolutionary struggle and production construction. Our slogan is "both soaring enthusiasm and the spirit of scientific analysis," and the scientific analysis we advocate is a scientific analysis that is combined with revolutionary enthusiasm. As for the "scientific analysis" flaunted by people with right-leaning ideas, it is often unscientific.

### 科学分析和分析而不科学

    科学分析和分析而不科学
    吴滤
    现在许多人都明白冲天干劲和科学分析相结合的重要性了。但是科学分析必须要科学，分析而并不科学，仍然不能达到掌握客观规律的目的。
    云南印染厂试验“循环连锅煮布法”发生的事情就是一个例子。有人分析的结果是，这个办法有科学根据，能解决生产中的关键问题，应该试验推行；还有人分析的结果是，会引起汽管爆炸、会把煮布锅冲翻，“搞起来危险”。后来在第一次试验遇到挫折时，有人分析的结果是由于缺乏经验，并不是新煮布法的缺陷，仍要坚持试验；还有人分析的结果是，试验白搞了，再也不要试验下去了。请看：同一件事情，不同的人来分析，竟得出如此不同的结论。谁是谁非呢？真理只有一条。实践检验的结果表明：前一种人的分析是真正科学的，“循环连锅煮布法”果然成功了，达到了预期的效果；后一种人的分析是并不科学的，汽管没有爆炸，煮布锅没有冲翻，全无什么“危险”。前一种人是厂的领导、车间的党支部书记和绝大多数工人、技术人员，后一种人是少数有右倾保守思想的人。
    类似这样的事情还可以举出很多。
    为什么同一件事情，不同的人来分析，竟得出如此不同的结论来呢？原因之一是，有人看到整体，有人只看到局部；有人看到主流，有人只看到支流。思想方法犯了片面性，分析问题当然就不可能科学。除了这个思想方法上的原因以外，还可以追溯到更深远的原因上去。在阶级斗争的领域中，站在不同的阶级立场，对问题的看法就截然不同。例如资产阶级的社会科学家总是不能科学地解释社会的发展，只有无产阶级的社会科学家才能科学地解释社会的发展，并且指明社会发展的必然趋势。在我们的生产斗争中，也是如此。只有干劲冲天的人，对于新的事物怀有满腔热情而又掌握了一定的科学技术知识或者有了一定的实践经验的人，才能对生产中的新的问题作出真正科学的分析，根据这个分析来指导生产的发展。有右倾思想的人，干劲不足的人，虽然口头上也讲“科学分析”，甚至更喜欢用“科学分析”这个字眼，但是他们是新事物的怀疑派，他们是戴着灰色眼镜来“科学分析”的，因而分析的结果总是并不科学的。
    这是一个很有益的经验。科学分析是极为重要的。大至整个形势，小至一件工具的改革，都要进行科学分析。没有科学分析，就不能掌握事物的规律。科学分析是革命斗争和生产建设的武器。我们的口号是“既要有冲天的干劲，又要有科学分析的精神”，我们所提倡的科学分析是同革命干劲结合在一起的科学分析。至于有右倾思想的人所标榜的“科学分析”，则常常是并不科学的。
