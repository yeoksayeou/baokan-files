    The Utterly Loyal People
    ——Remembering Several Ordinary Party Members on Beijing Streets
    By Our Correspondent Sun Shikai

    In the city, there are many such Communist Party members who tirelessly toil on the streets year after year, serving the millions of residents without expecting any reward.

    Going Through Thick and Thin for the Residents

    In the Hepingli-Ditan area, there is an old woman wearing an old scarf who braves the biting cold wind, going door to door to tell everyone: "This year's Chinese cabbage harvest is bountiful! We must live rich days as if they were poor days, and don't waste any cabbage stalks or leaves..." Sometimes, she finds that some people don't know how to store cabbage, and she enthusiastically introduces a set of home cabbage storage and anti-rotting methods. Who is she? Residents in this area can tell you: Her name is Wu Lianhua, she is the Secretary of the Third Branch of the Hepingli Street Party Committee and Director of the Residents Committee.

    Although Wu Lianhua does not participate in production in a factory or work in an office, she works more hours every day than most people, and her tasks are more complex and cumbersome, handling everything from organizing housewives to participate in production to mediating family disputes, from repairing houses in the rainy season to preventing diseases. Someone once asked her: "Don't you find this kind of work too trivial and too hard?" This old Communist Party member did not answer directly, but said this: "Whatever the Party tells me to do, I will do it. I just want to be a good tool of the Party."

    Wu Lianhua has been a Party member for nearly twenty years. In the past, in the countryside, she organized women to engage in production and make military shoes to support the War of Liberation. After entering the city, she took on street work, never receiving a salary or choosing any occupation, but only working loyally for the Party, treating every household's affairs on the street as her own. She heard that Li Guanglan, a woman who had just started working, was having marital problems. She rushed to Li's house late at night and learned that the man disliked the woman for being black and dirty from coking and didn't want her to participate in production; the woman insisted on leaving the family to work, and the two argued endlessly. Wu Lianhua supported Li Guanglan's idea, used the method of presenting the facts and reasoning, criticized the man, and also told the woman to pay more attention to her husband's life after work. A few days later, the workmates in the factory saw that Li Guanglan was full of energy in production, laughing and talking, and they asked with concern: "How is your family?" Li Guanglan said with a smile: "It's all good! Our branch secretary helped solve it."

    On the street, Wu Lianhua saw that housewives were participating in production one after another, and they had no time to wash and mend clothes for adults and children. She mobilized three street activists to organize a neighborhood service center to serve the residents. When winter came, she organized street literacy classes to allow housewives to learn culture.

    "If you don't learn the Party's policies well, you won't have anything in your mind, and it's easy to become lax." Wu Lianhua deeply realized this in her street work, so she also paid close attention to the work of the branch. Although the ten or so Party members in their branch are scattered in an area of more than ten li, and each of them holds different types of work, they still insist on spending "Party Day" every week, no matter how busy they are, to study the Party's policies. In this way, they have found the source of continuous revolutionary power from a strict organizational life.

    Taking the Lead in Everything

    In an office with very simple equipment, Tang Shuzhen just finished answering the phone and said to a sick woman sitting next to her: "Listen to me, go home and rest well, I will come to see you when I have time."

    The woman left satisfied, and Tang Shuzhen seized the time to arrange for the workshops to organize production personnel to study the Beijing Daily editorial "Promote Street Production from Victory to Greater Victory" that night. She turned back and continued to ask the accountant: "How is our technical innovation campaign going these past two days?" The accountant, who also manages all the affairs of the factory, flipped through the statistics table and said: "In one day, one hundred and eighteen technical innovation proposals have been put forward!" At this time, Tang Shuzhen excitedly said to herself: Who would have thought that housewives could devote themselves to socialist construction and exert their wisdom and strength so quickly!

    Walking into the Jian'guomen Street Gold Lacquer Inlay Processing Factory, seeing such a capable female factory director as Tang Shuzhen, it is hard to imagine that she was a housewife who stepped out of her family to participate in production more than a year ago.

    Tang Shuzhen, the mother of six children, is called a red flag among street party members. She has been doing street work for ten years, bustling in the streets and alleys all day, mobilizing residents to do sanitation, read newspapers, and learn about current events. She often asks herself: "As a Communist Party member, no matter what position you are in, you should seize every minute to work for the Party." Therefore, she takes the lead in everything on the street. During the Great Leap Forward last year, when the Party proposed that street residents should engage in production on a large scale, Tang Shuzhen was very happy. She thought: "By doing this, housewives will no longer be bystanders in socialist construction, but can become active participants." At that time, she was determined to break through all difficulties and open up production avenues for housewives. When she heard that the match factory had work, although she didn't know where the factory was, she took the referral letter from the street office and went to find it. She ran all day in the rain and hunger, and finally found the match factory in the eastern suburbs and brought back the first batch of work - pasting matchboxes. That night, after she distributed the work to the residents, she thought: Engaging in production is not a joke. No housewives have ever done this before. If something goes wrong and causes losses to the country, it will affect the confidence of street residents in participating in production. She decided to learn while doing it herself, and then guide others. Tang Shuzhen used this method to organize more than a dozen kinds of street production, absorbing more than 90% of the housewives with labor force in the nearby streets to participate in production.

    In February this year, when the three gold lacquer processing production groups in the Jianguomen area merged into one processing factory, she became the branch secretary and director, taking on the leadership work of the entire factory. Many new things were placed before her. At this time, she could not help but hesitate. She went to the street party committee and said: "I have the courage to do it, but I don't understand the technology!" The street party committee helped her analyze this problem and introduced the Party's mass line working method. Since then, she has had an idea in her mind. Whenever she encounters major or minor matters, she relies on the masses to solve them, and finally turned this street processing factory into a red flag in the city's street industry.

    The number of women who come to the factory to participate in production has gradually increased from one hundred to more than two hundred and sixty. She thought that after housewives participated in production, nurseries and canteens helped solve the problem of taking care of children and cooking. Learning is the most urgent need in production. After discussing with the workshop director, she decided to launch political, cultural and technical studies throughout the factory. No matter how busy the production is every week, she also uses spare time to organize production personnel to read newspapers, study politics, discuss state affairs, and also invites old technicians from the Beijing Gold Lacquer Inlay Factory to teach technical lessons. Many housewives have improved their political awareness and have more enthusiasm for production. The processing factory can now do tens of thousands of pieces of processing per month, and the product quality is also very good, which is very popular with the main factory, compared with the few hundred pieces in its first month.

    Bearing Hardship Without Complaint

    At noon, when women carrying cotton wadding and children carrying schoolbags walk into the Caochang Street canteen to eat, Grandma Bai, with her frost-white hair, is the busiest. She sells food for a while, delivers water for a while, and sometimes walks to a group of children eating around a table, stroking their frostbitten faces and saying, "Come in and warm up before eating!" A group of people rushed into the canteen with gongs and drums, sending a red big-character poster. In the noisy crowd, adults and children congratulated the old woman with a smile on her face, thanking her for opening the street canteen for the residents under the leadership of the Party.

    "I am a housewife, old, and uneducated. How can I do more work for the Party?" Bai Shulan has been thinking about this issue since the day she joined the Party. During the Great Leap Forward last year, many housewives jumped out of the kitchen and took up jobs, but Bai Shulan went into the kitchen and became a cook. At that time, she thought not about which occupation "has a future," but that after housewives on the street participated in production, someone had to cook for adults and children. Opening a public canteen requires houses, tables and chairs, and pots and pans. Where do these things come from? Bai Shulan resolutely responded to the Party's call and mobilized the masses, starting from scratch. She ran around all day, borrowing tables and chairs, pulling waste materials. The residents saw that the old woman was so enthusiastic about collective welfare undertakings that they automatically donated the extra pots and pans from their families. The carpenters and tilers on the street also came to help after work, building two kitchens in a large courtyard. The canteen started cooking, and Bai Shulan worked as a cook and a purchaser, getting up early in the morning to run from Dongzhimen to the Dongxinqiao area to purchase food, trying everything to make the food delicious and cheap. The number of people eating increased from the initial five or six people to nearly a hundred people. It's as lively as a celebration every day. Some families are couples who participate in production and get off work late, and Bai Shulan takes care of the children eating in the canteen. She saw some women bringing cold steamed buns and corn buns from home, and she rushed over to help heat them up, always afraid that everyone would get sick from eating cold food. Zhang Xiulan, who works in the street iron factory, has a blind mother who came from the countryside to see her daughter. Grandma Bai knew about this and thought: If Xiulan takes care of her old mother at home, it will definitely affect production. She immediately took on this housework, allowing Xiulan to concentrate on production. Every day at mealtime, she picks up the old lady, prepares some food according to the old woman's taste, and sends her home after eating. When the old lady left Beijing to return to her hometown, Zhang Xiulan was moved and went to the canteen to thank Grandma Bai. Grandma Bai said: "As long as your production is good, I will be satisfied!"

    Bai Shulan, this ordinary Communist Party member, felt the endless joy of "one person's hard work, everyone's happiness" from these service-oriented social work. She thought: Although she did not produce a foot of cloth or refine a furnace of iron, she let many housewives free up their cooking time to participate in production, which not only supported socialist construction, but also helped housewives to liberate themselves from the kitchen.

    忠心耿耿的人们
    ——记北京街道上几位普通党员
    本报记者　孙世恺
    在城市里，有许多这样的共产党员，她们终年累月在街道上奔忙，不知疲倦，不计报酬，为千千万万的居民服务。
    千辛万苦为居民
    在和平里地坛一带，有位头戴旧围巾的老大娘，迎着凛冽寒风，沿街挨户的告诉各家说：“今年的大白菜丰收啦！我们要把富日子当穷日子过，菜邦菜叶都别糟塌了……”有时，她发现一些人家不会储存白菜，还热心地介绍一番家庭储菜防烂的一套办法。她是谁？居住在这一带的住户都可告诉你：她叫吴莲花，是和平里街道党委第三支部书记兼居民委员会主任。
    吴莲花虽然没有到工厂参加生产或去机关工作，可是她每天工作的时间都比一般人要多，工作的任务更是复杂繁琐得多，从组织家庭妇女参加生产到调解家庭纠纷，从雨季修房到预防疾病，无所不管。有人问过她：“你不嫌这种工作太琐碎太辛苦吗？”这位老共产党员没有正面回答，只说了这样一句话：“党叫我干什么，我就干什么，只想做个党的好工具。”
    吴莲花有近二十年的党龄，过去在农村里，组织妇女搞生产和做军鞋，支援解放战争。进城以后又担任起街道工作，从没有领过一份工资，也没有挑选过任何职业，只是忠心耿耿为党工作，把街道上每家的事都看成是自己的事。她听说刚参加生产的妇女李广兰夫妻不和，深夜赶到李家，了解到男人嫌女人炼焦又黑又脏，不让去参加生产；女人偏偏要走出家庭去劳动，两人争吵不休。吴莲花支持李广兰的主张，用摆事实讲道理的方法，批评了那个男人，还嘱咐女人下班后多关心些丈夫的生活。没过几天，工厂里的工友看见李广兰参加生产的劲头十足，又有说有笑，就关切地问：“你的家里怎样啦？”李广兰面带笑容地说：“好啦！我们的支部书记帮助解决的。”
    吴莲花在街道上，看到家庭妇女纷纷参加生产，没时间为大人孩子拆洗缝补，她就发动三个街道积极分子组织起邻里服务所，为居民服务。冬天到了，她又张罗着组织街道扫盲班，好让家庭妇女学文化。
    “不学好党的政策，脑子里没东西，就容易松劲。”吴莲花在街道工作中深深体会到这一点，所以她对支部工作也抓得紧紧的。尽管她们支部的十多个党员分散居住在十几里一片的地区里，各人又都担任着不同性质的工作，可是每周不管怎样忙碌，也坚持过“党日”，学习党的政策。这样，她们也就从严格的组织生活中，找到了不断革命的力量的泉源。
    事事当先锋
    在一间设备极简单的办公室里，唐淑贞刚接完电话，又对她身旁坐着的一位患病妇女说：“听我的话，回家好好休养，我有工夫就去看你。”
    那个妇女满意地走了，唐淑贞抓紧时间向各车间布置当天晚上组织生产人员学习北京日报社论“推动街道生产从胜利走向更大胜利”。她回过头来接着问会计：“咱们这两天开展技术革新运动怎样？”那位兼管全厂一切事务的会计翻看一下统计表说：“一天工夫就提出一百一十八项技术革新建议！”这时，唐淑贞兴奋地自言自语说：谁能想到家庭妇女投身社会主义建设，就这样快地发挥出智慧和力量啊！
    走进建国门街道金漆镶嵌加工厂，看到唐淑贞这样能干的女厂长，很难想到她是一年多以前才走出家庭参加生产的一个家庭妇女。
    唐淑贞，这个六个孩子的妈妈，被称为街道党员中的一面红旗。她做街道工作已经十年，整天在大街小巷奔忙，发动居民搞卫生，读报，学时事。她经常这样要求自己：“做为一个共产党员，无论在什么岗位上，都应当抓紧每一分钟为党工作。”所以，街道上的样样事，她都走在前面。在去年大跃进中，党提出街道居民大搞生产的号召时，唐淑贞的心里可乐开了花。她想：“这样办，家庭妇女再不是社会主义建设的旁观者，就可变成积极参加者。”当时，她决心冲破一切困难，为家庭妇女开辟生产途径。当她听说火柴厂有活，虽然还不知道这个工厂在哪里，她拿起街道办事处的介绍信就去找，饿肚子冒雨跑了一天，终于在东郊找到了火柴厂，揽回第一批活——糊火柴盒。当天夜里，她把活分给居民以后，心想：搞生产可不是闹着玩的，家庭妇女谁也没干过，弄不好给国家造成损失，还会影响街道居民参加生产的信心。她决心自己一边作一边学，再指导别人。唐淑贞用这种办法一连组织起十多种街道生产，吸收了附近街道上90％以上有劳动力的家庭妇女参加了生产。
    今年2月，建国门一带的三个金漆加工生产组合并成一个加工厂时，她当支部书记又任厂长，担任了全厂的领导工作。许多新事物摆在她的眼前。这时，她不免有些踌躇。她找到街道党委说：“我有勇气干，就是不懂技术呀！”街道党委帮助她分析了这个问题并介绍了党的群众路线的工作方法。从此，她心里有了主意，凡是遇到大小事，都依靠群众去解决，终于把这个街道加工厂办成全市街道工业中的一面红旗。
    来厂参加生产的妇女，已经由一百人逐渐增加到二百六十多人。她想家庭妇女参加生产以后，有托儿所和食堂帮助解决了带孩子和做饭的问题，在生产上最迫切需要学习。她和车间主任商量后决定在全厂展开政治文化和技术学习。每周生产不管多忙，也利用业余时间组织生产人员读报，学习政治，讨论国家大事，还邀请北京金漆镶嵌厂派来的老技工教技术课。许多家庭妇女政治觉悟提高了，生产劲头更足。这个加工厂从开办时每月只做几百件加工品，现在每月能做上万件，产品质量也很好，很受主厂的欢迎。
    任劳任怨
    晌午，当身带棉絮的妇女和背着书包的孩子走进草厂街道食堂吃饭时，两鬓如霜的白大妈最忙碌了。她一会儿卖饭，一会儿送水，有时又走到围着一桌吃饭的成群孩子面前，抚摸着孩子们被冻红的脸蛋说：“进屋暖和暖和再吃饭！”一群人敲锣打鼓又涌进了食堂，送来一张红色的大字报。在人声吵杂中，大人和孩子都向满脸堆笑的老大妈祝贺，感谢她在党的领导下为居民开办了街道食堂。
      “我是个家庭妇女，年纪老了，又没文化，怎样多为党做些工作呢？”白淑兰从入党那天起，就时刻思念这个问题。在去年大跃进中，许多家庭妇女跳出锅台走上工作岗位，白淑兰偏偏走进厨房又当起炊事员。当时，她想到不是那个职业“有前途”，而是街道上的家庭妇女参加生产以后，大人孩子吃饭总得有人去做。办公共食堂需要房子、桌椅，又需要锅碗瓢盆，这些东西从哪来呢？白淑兰坚决响应党的号召，发动群众，白手起家。她整天东奔西跑，借桌椅，拉废料，居民们看到老大娘这样热心集体福利事业，自动献出各家多余的锅碗瓢盆。街道上的瓦木工下班后也来帮忙。在一个大院里搭起两间厨房。食堂开伙了，白淑兰当炊事员又当采购员，清早起来从东直门里跑到北新桥东西一带采购食品，想一切办法把饭菜做得好吃又便宜。吃饭的人由开始五、六个人增加到近百人。每天吃饭时像办喜事一样热闹。有些家庭夫妻俩参加生产下班晚了，白淑兰就在食堂里照顾孩子吃饭。她看到一些妇女从家中带来了凉馒头和窝头，又抢过去帮助热热，总怕大家吃冷食生病。在街道铁工厂里工作的张秀兰，有位瞎母亲从乡下赶来看女儿。白大妈知道这事，心想：要秀兰在家照顾老母亲吃饭一定得影响生产。她马上承担下这份家务事，让秀兰安心去生产。每天到吃饭时，将老太太接来，按照老人口味调配一些饭菜，等吃完饭再送回家去。当老太太离开北京回乡时，张秀兰感动地到食堂向白大妈道谢。白大妈说：“只要你生产好，我就心满意足啦！”
    白淑兰这个普通的共产党员，就从这些服务性的社会工作中感到“一人辛苦，众人幸福”的无穷乐趣。她想：自己虽然没有生产一尺布或炼出一炉铁，可是让许多家庭妇女把做饭时间腾出来去生产，这样既支援了社会主义建设，也帮助家庭妇女从锅台边解放出来了。
