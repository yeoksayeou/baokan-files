Many Roads to Rural Electrification
    Feihe Commune Successfully Trials Wind Power Station
    Anyi Power Plant Manufactures Complete Small Power Station Equipment
    (Our newspaper, Hefei, 6th dispatch) The Feihe People's Commune in the suburbs of Bengbu has utilized wind power generation, enabling 280 households of commune members to install electric lights; at the same time, it has also solved part of the power problem for rice and flour processing and nearby farmland irrigation. For this reason, the commune members wrote poems praising it: "The commune's power is boundless, ordering the wind god to work. The wind turbine dances in the wind, generating electricity to show its magical power, drawing water to irrigate the crops, grinding white flour for steamed buns; from now on, there is no need for oil to light lamps, using electric lights to cultivate the land, realizing agricultural electrification, the wind turbine has made the greatest contribution."
    The wind turbine of the Feihe People's Commune wind power station—the "Bengbu 59" wind turbine, was trial-produced by the Dongfeng Machinery Factory of the Bengbu Suburban United Cooperative using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. The main components include propellers, directional rudders, test vanes, generators, water pumps, small steel mills, cotton gins, etc. The usage of the wind turbine by the Fourth Brigade of the Feihe People's Commune proves that: at force 2 winds, the wind turbine can grind flour, grinding 200 jin per hour (one person and one animal grind 80 jin of flour per day), pumping 21 tons of water per hour; at force 3 winds, the wind turbine can drive a 5.6 kilowatt generator to generate electricity, driving a 6-in-4-out water pump, pumping 150 tons of water per hour; at force 5 winds, it can drive electricity generation, water pumping, and milling machines. In addition, a set of 122-volt storage batteries is installed, so that electricity can be supplied by the storage batteries when there is no wind at night. Generally, a half-day charge can supply two nights. The "Bengbu 59" wind turbine has the advantages of easy availability of materials, simple manufacturing, and convenient operation. A wind turbine only uses 4 cubic meters of wood and 1700 jin of iron, with a cost of 2700 yuan.
    Hydropower generation cannot work without water, thermal power generation cannot work without fuel, the greatest advantage of wind power generation is that it is not subject to these restrictions, as long as there is wind, it can generate electricity, and wind is everywhere. The situation of the Feihe People's Commune using wind turbines for more than 40 days proves that in more than 40 days, there were only 12 days with slightly less wind, no wind during the day, and wind in the morning and evening. Fully utilizing wind power generation in the vast rural areas is the most economical and easy thing to do. The relevant leading departments in Bengbu City have decided to universally install wind turbines in the rural areas of the suburbs from now until the first quarter of next year. Now, the Bengbu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has specially established a wind power generation research group, with cadres and technicians from various machinery factories, electrical machinery factories, and meteorological observatories participating, to study the improvement and upgrading work of the "Bengbu 59" wind turbine.
    (Dispatch) The staff and workers of the Anyi County Power Plant in Jiangxi Province have made a complete set of electrical equipment for rural power stations, including a 25-kilowatt generator, ammeter, etc. by themselves.
    The Anyi Power Plant was a power plant built in 1951 with simple equipment and poor technical conditions. Originally, the entire plant had only one 25-kilowatt generator and three workers. In August last year, the Anyi County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an industrial conference and put forward a requirement: to use the county's power plant as a base to vigorously trial-produce rural power station equipment and create conditions for gradually realizing rural electrification. After the meeting, under the leadership of the Party branch, the workers of the Anyi Power Plant broke the mysterious concept that a dilapidated stall could not produce power generation equipment and began the trial production of power generation equipment.
    In the process of trial production, they overcame many difficulties. For example, when manufacturing transformers, they had no drawings, so they used paper to cut out models and constructed them accordingly; without silicon steel sheets, they used black iron sheets instead; without a winding machine, they studied and made a winding wooden frame with carpenters; without yarn-covered wire, they used wood to make a wire wrapping machine and pulled the wire to wrap the yarn themselves. In this way, they finally manufactured a set of all the equipment needed for a rural small power station, including generators, electric motors, ammeters, transformers, distribution panels, oil switches, knife switches, lamp holders, sheathed wires, etc., by the end of September this year. This set of equipment has undergone many tests, and the technical appraisal of the chief engineer of the Provincial Department of Water Resources and Electric Power has proved that it meets the design requirements.
    Now, this set of equipment has been used by the Anyi Power Plant to build a small 25-kilowatt power station for the Dinghu People's Commune near the county seat. (Attached picture)

    农村办电门路多
    淝淮公社试建风力发电站成功
    安义电厂制成小电站全套设备
    本报合肥6日电　蚌埠市郊区淝淮人民公社利用风力发电，使附近二百八十户社员装上了电灯；同时还解决了部分米面加工和附近农田灌溉的动力问题。为此社员们写诗颂扬道：“公社威力大无穷，喝令风神来做工。风力机儿迎风舞，发出电力显神通，车来河水浇庄稼，磨出白面上蒸笼；点灯从此不用油，电灯光下把地种，实现农业电气化，风力机儿立头功”。
    淝淮人民公社风力发电站的风车——“蚌埠59号”风力机，是蚌埠郊区联社的东风机械厂用土洋结合的办法试制出来的。主要部件有，螺旋桨、定向舵、测页板、发电机、抽水机、小钢磨、弹花机等组成。淝淮人民公社四大队使用风力机的情况证明：二级风时，风力机可以磨面，每小时可磨二百斤，（一人一畜每天磨面八十斤），抽水每小时二十一吨；三级风时风力机能带动五点六瓩的发电机发电，带动六进四出的水泵抽水机，一小时抽水一百五十吨；五级风时能带动发电、抽水和磨面机工作。此外，还安有一组一百二十二伏的储电瓶，以备晚上无风时由储电瓶供电。一般冲半天电可供两晚用。“蚌埠59号”风力机具有材料容易解决，制造简单，操作方便等优点，一架风力机只用木材四立方米，铁一千七百斤，成本二千七百元。
    水力发电没有水不行，火力发电没有燃料不行，风力发电的最大好处是不受这些限制，只要有风就能发电，而风到处都有。淝淮人民公社四十多天使用风力机的情况证明，四十多天中只有十二天的风小些，白天无风，早晚有风。在广大农村中充分利用风力发电是最经济又容易做到的事。蚌埠市有关领导部门已决定从现在起到明年第一季度在郊区农村普遍安装风力机。现在中共蚌埠市委已专门成立了风力发电研究小组，由各机械厂、电机厂、气象台的干部和技术人员参加，研究“蚌埠59号”风力机的提高和改进工作。
    本报讯　江西省安义县电厂职工自己动手制成了二十五瓩包括发电机电流表等农村电站的全套电气设备。
    安义电厂是1951年建成的一个设备简陋，技术条件很差的发电厂。原来全厂只有一部二十五瓩的发电机和三个工人。去年8月，中共安义县委召开工业会议时，提出了一个要求：要以本县电厂为基地，大力试制农村电站设备，为逐步实现农村电气化创造条件。会后，安义电厂的工人们在党支部的领导下，打破了破摊子造不了发电器材的神秘观念，开始了发电设备的试制工作。
    在试制过程中，他们克服了不少困难。如制造变压器时没有图纸，他们就用纸剪成模型照样施工；没有矽钢片，就用黑铁皮代替；没有绕线机，就和木工研究做成绕线木架；没有纱包线，就用木头制成一台包线机，自己拉线包纱。就这样，他们终于在今年9月底制成了一套包括发电机、电动机、电流表、变压器、配电盘、油开关、闸刀、灯头、皮线等农村小型电站需要的全部设备。这套设备经过多次试验，又经省水利电力厅总工程师的技术鉴定，证明合乎设计要求。
    现在，这套设备已由安义电厂用来替县城附近的丁湖人民公社建立一座二十五瓩的小型发电站。（附图片）
