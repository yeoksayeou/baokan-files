Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 28th—The Jakarta Military Court opened this morning to publicly try American pilot Allen Pope for helping the rebel group carry out subversive activities against the Indonesian government.

　　Honorary Lieutenant Colonel Sazono served as the chief judge of the military court. Prosecutor Air Force Major Proradorono read the indictment.

　　The indictment stated that American pilot Allen Pope helped the enemy oppose the legitimate government of the Republic of Indonesia when Indonesia declared a state of war. The indictment listed a series of crimes committed by the defendant while piloting a B-26 aircraft in Indonesia, carrying out bombing and strafing missions that caused deaths and property damage. These crimes included bombing Ambon Airport, naval vessels, Ambon Port, and air force bases in the Maluku Islands and North Sulawesi.

　　Lawyer Sukajo, appointed by the Indonesian side as the defendant's defender, requested that all charges against the American pilot be dropped on the grounds that the defendant's receipt of the indictment had been delayed, and that the indictment did not mention the defendant's nationality, the national insignia of the aircraft he used, or the type of aircraft.

　　The prosecutor rejected the first reason put forward by the defense lawyer, saying that the indictment was delivered to the defendant fourteen days before the trial began. However, he promised to study the other issues raised by the defendant's defense lawyer and requested a postponement until January 2nd next year for the court to reconvene. Court President Sazono then announced the postponement of the court session.

　　More than 300 people attended the court this morning to observe this high-profile case, including government officials, members of parliament, and representatives from all walks of life. Two officials from the United States Embassy in Jakarta also attended the court.

　　Pope's plane was shot down on May 18, 1958, during his second bombing of Ambon. Today's newspaper reports said that the number of casualties during Pope's first bombing of Ambon was three to four hundred people, including soldiers and residents attending prayers. Lieutenant Colonel Piet, commander of the Maluku-West Irian Defense Region, pointed out that Pope was one of eight American pilots employed by the "Comprehensive Struggle Charter" rebel group, each receiving a monthly "allowance" of $10,000. Piet said that Pope dropped a total of thirty tons of bombs in Indonesia.

　　"People's Daily" said today that Pope was previously a pilot of the "Flying Tigers," and that the "Flying Tigers" were tactically under the command of the U.S. Pacific Military Command. Pope obeyed his American masters to bomb and kill the Indonesian people. The newspaper demanded that the court sentence Pope according to his crimes.

　　印度尼西亚雅加达军事法庭
    审讯帮助叛乱集团的美飞行员
    新华社雅加达28日电　雅加达军事法庭在今天上午开庭，公开审讯帮助叛乱集团进行颠覆印度尼西亚政府活动的美国驾驶员艾伦·波普。
    军事法庭由沙佐诺名誉中校担任首席法官。检察官普罗若腊多诺空军少校宣读了起诉书。
    起诉书说，美国驾驶员艾伦·波普在印度尼西亚宣布处于战争状态的时候帮助敌人反对印度尼西亚共和国的合法政府。起诉书列举了被告驾驶B—26型飞机在印度尼西亚执行轰炸和扫射任务时造成生命死亡和财产损失的一系列罪行。这些罪行包括轰炸安汶机场、海军船只、安汶港口以及马鲁古群岛和北苏拉威西的空军基地。
    由印度尼西亚方面任命为被告的辩护人的苏卡佐律师要求撤销对这个美国驾驶员的一切控诉，理由是，被告收到起诉书的时间受到了耽搁，同时起诉书中没有提到被告的国籍和他所使用的飞机的国籍标志以及飞机的类别。
    检察官驳斥了辩护律师所提出的第一个理由，他说，起诉书在审讯开始前十四天就送给了被告。但是，他答应研究被告辩护律师所提出的其他问题，他要求延期到明年1月2日重新开庭。法庭庭长沙佐诺于是宣布法庭延期。
    今天上午有三百多人到法庭旁听这一为社会人士注目的案件，其中包括政府官员、议员以及社会各界的代表。美国驻雅加达大使馆的两个官员也到法庭旁听。
    波普驾驶的飞机是在1958年5月18日，他第二次轰炸安汶时被击落的。今天的报纸消息说，波普第一次轰炸安汶时，伤亡人数有三、四百人，包括军人和做礼拜的居民。马鲁古—西伊里安防区司令皮埃特斯中校曾指出，波普是受“全面斗争约章”叛乱集团雇用的八名美国飞行员之一，他们每人每月领一万美元的“零用钱”。皮埃特斯说，波普在印度尼西亚扔了总重三十吨的炸弹。
    “人民日报”今天说，波普以前是“飞虎队”的飞行员，而“飞虎队”在战术上是属于美国太平洋军事司令部的，波普听命于美国主子来轰炸和杀害印度尼西亚人民。这家报纸要求法庭对波普按罪判刑。
