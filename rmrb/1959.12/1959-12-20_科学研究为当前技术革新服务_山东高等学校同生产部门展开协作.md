Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 19th: Higher education institutions in Shandong Province are closely integrating scientific research with production to serve the current technological revolution and the Great Leap Forward in production.

Various higher education institutions are actively partnering with production units to undertake research into key technical issues in production. Shandong Institute of Technology has partnered with many factories and enterprises in Jinan, accepting research tasks on ninety-four key production issues raised by the factories. Together with Jinan No. 1 Foundry, they researched and improved the manufacturing technology of ductile iron rails, reducing the scrap rate from the original 28% to 2.2%, and the tensile strength of the rails also exceeded the original target. Shandong University has partnered with twenty production units, accepting forty-three research projects, fifteen of which are major key issues. For example, the Mathematics Department undertook the mathematical calculations for the Weishan Reservoir project on the Yellow River, research on blasting theory, relevant issues on the hydrology of Shandong rivers, and the research on deep plowing plows. Shandong Normal College is undertaking thirty-two research projects, including ongoing research on Shandong's groundwater reserves. Shandong Agricultural College is continuing to summarize the high-yield experiences of several major crops in Shandong Province, such as wheat, cotton, sweet potatoes, and peanuts. Over the past year, teachers and students from Shandong Medical College have gone to the countryside and factories, conducting numerous investigations into more than ten diseases that seriously endanger the health of the people of the province, such as filariasis, hookworm disease, and infectious hepatitis, and have proposed effective prevention and control measures.

The Party committees of various higher education institutions implement political command in leading scientific research, and adopted the working method of the mass line. First, they established the idea of scientific research serving production and construction, and at the same time, launched a large-scale mass movement, promoting the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. Previously, only a few senior teachers participated in scientific research activities at Shandong Institute of Technology. From 1952 to 1956, only forty-seven research projects were completed, not only were the quantities small, but the quality was also low, with only 49% of the total truly combined with production and teaching. In 1958, the mass line was implemented and the masses were mobilized, and 71.8% of the teachers and about half of the students participated in scientific research activities. A total of one hundred and seventy-one scientific research projects were completed within one year, and these projects directly served production and teaching. More than one hundred and twenty teachers and students from the Department of Pathological Anatomy at Shandong Medical College, due to promoting the style of daring to think, speak, and act, and with the assistance of relevant units, completed the analysis of more than ten thousand pathological anatomy specimens of tumors, which had not been completed in the past few years, in just three months. More than three hundred teachers and students from the Geography Department of Shandong Normal College spent three months conducting a comprehensive field investigation of the natural geography and economic geography of each prefecture in the province, and wrote more than 1.6 million words of regional investigation reports, preparing materials for compiling the Shandong Geographical Records.

Various higher education institutions have launched cooperation with various parties in scientific research. For major school-wide projects, the strength of various departments is organized to complete them together. Some are linked to factories and mining enterprises, where production units raise the problems that need to be solved in production, and the school sends people to work with engineers, technicians and workers to research and solve them together. Some participated in the research of major research projects organized uniformly by the country and the province. Some are completed in cooperation with scientific research institutions.

    科学研究为当前技术革新服务
    山东高等学校同生产部门展开协作
    新华社济南19日电　山东省各高等学校的科学研究工作紧密结合生产，为当前的技术革命和生产大跃进服务。
    各高等学校纷纷同生产单位挂钩，承担生产中技术关键问题的研究。山东工学院与济南市很多工厂企业挂钩，接受了各厂提出的九十四项生产关键问题的研究任务。他们同济南第一铸造厂一起，研究改进了球墨铸铁土铁轨的制造技术，使废品率由原来的28％下降到2.2％，铁轨的抗拉强度也超过了原订指标。山东大学同二十个生产单位挂钩，接受了四十三个项目的研究任务，其中有十五个是重大关键性的问题。如数学系承担了黄河位山水库工程中的数学计算问题，爆破理论，山东河流水文有关问题和深耕犁的研究等。山东师范学院承担的三十二个研究项目中，已在着手进行的有山东地下水储量问题等的研究。山东农学院正在继续进行小麦、棉花、甘薯、花生等山东省几种主要农作物的丰产经验总结。山东医学院师生一年来下乡下厂，对危害本省人民健康较大的丝虫病、钩虫病、传染性肝炎等十多种疾病进行了很多次调查，提出了有效的防治措施。
    各高等学校党委在领导科学研究上实行政治挂帅，采取了群众路线的工作方法。首先树立科学研究为生产建设服务的思想，同时大搞群众运动，发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。山东工学院原来参加科学研究活动的只有几个老教师，从1952年到1956年期间只完成四十七个研究项目，不仅数量少，质量也低，真正结合生产结合教学的只占总数的49％；1958年贯彻了群众路线，发动了群众，全院有71.8％的教师和一半左右的学生参加了科学研究活动，一年内共完成科学研究一百七十一项，而且这些项目都直接服务于生产、服务于教学。山东医学院病理解剖学教研组师生一百二十多人，由于发扬敢想敢说敢作的风格，在争取有关单位协助下，用了三个月的时间就完成了过去几年未完成的一万多个肿瘤病理解剖标本的分析工作。山东师范学院地理系师生三百多人，以三个月的时间，对全省各专区的自然地理和经济地理进行了全面地实地调查，写出了一百六十多万字的分区调查报告，为编写山东地理志准备了资料。
    各高等学校在科学研究中同各方面展开了协作。对全校性的重大项目，就组织各系科的力量共同完成。有的同厂矿企业挂钩，由生产单位提出生产中需要解决的问题，学校派人协同工程技术人员和工人共同研究解决。有的参加了全国和全省统一组织的重大研究项目的研究。有的是同科学研究机构协作完成的。
