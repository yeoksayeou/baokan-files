Changsha Dispatch from our newspaper, December 27th. Hunan Province has achieved an all-round success in the acquisition of agricultural and sideline products. This year, benefiting from a bumper harvest after overcoming an extraordinary drought, the province's grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crop procurement tasks were over-fulfilled ahead of schedule in November. The planned total value of agricultural and sideline product purchases was also completed 54 days ahead of schedule on November 7th. At the same time, the province ensured timely processing and transportation, and the outward transfer plans for grain, oil, pork, and poultry have also been over-fulfilled ahead of schedule.

This year, Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province strengthened their leadership over the acquisition of agricultural and sideline products, and vigorously launched mass movements. From the Provincial Party Committee to the Prefectural, County Party Committees, Communes, and Production Teams, Party organizations at all levels had one or two secretaries specifically in charge of the acquisition of agricultural and sideline products, unifying the acquisition work with the central tasks and closely combining them. Party committees at all levels paid close attention to the balanced development of acquisition work, vigorously assisted backward areas, and broke through weak links, ensuring that whenever a region lagged behind or a type of product had slow progress, the Party Secretary would lead the masses in attacking the weak links, so that the acquisition movement would develop comprehensively and evenly. Especially after the anti-Rightist upsurge and the encouragement of greater efforts that began in August, the mass movement on the commercial front rose even higher. The cotton procurement task was completed five months ahead of the annual plan, less than two months after the new cotton came on the market.

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, commercial sector employees, on the one hand, vigorously carried out acquisition publicity work, and on the other hand, created many working methods suitable for launching mass movements. When the broad masses launched a high tide of selling more and retaining less, actively delivering and selling agricultural and sideline products to the state, commercial departments in various places adopted methods such as combining surprise acquisitions with regular acquisitions, combining fixed-point acquisitions with mobile acquisitions, combining store acquisitions with organizing mass purchases on behalf of others, and combining acquisition with processing and transportation, to facilitate farmers in selling agricultural and sideline products. The agricultural and sideline products acquired this year were not only greater in quantity than any previous year, but also better in quality than any previous year.

In the work of acquiring agricultural and sideline products, the experience of the communist collaboration and competition of "one place with experience, spreading to four places; one place with difficulties, four places supporting" by the supply and marketing cooperatives of Dapu and four other communes in Hengshan County was popularized throughout the province under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee. Now, more than 39,000 pace-setters and more than 6,000 advanced units have emerged throughout the province, effectively promoting and accelerating the agricultural and sideline product acquisition movement. In the process of the competition, commercial departments at all levels held more than 2,000 on-site collaborative meetings for experience exchange, and more than 100 province-wide collaborative competitions and experience exchange meetings, making the acquisition upsurge develop higher and higher.

　　在战胜特大干旱获得丰收的基础上
    湖南农副产品全面收足
    粮棉油料在十一月份提前超额完成  涌现三万多标兵和六千个先进单位
    本报长沙27日电　湖南省农副产品收购实现满堂红。今年在战胜特大干旱获得丰收的有利条件下，全省粮、棉、油料征购任务早在11月就提前超额完成；农副产品收购总值计划也在11月7日提前五十四天完成。同时，全省做到了及时加工和调运，粮、油、猪、家禽的外调计划也已提前超额完成。
    湖南省各级党委今年加强了对农副产品收购工作的领导，大搞群众运动。从省委到地、县委、公社、生产队，各级党组织都有一位或两位书记专门抓农副产品收购工作，把收购工作与中心工作作了统一安排，紧密结合。各级党委十分注意收购工作的均衡发展，大力帮助后进地区，突破薄弱环节，做到哪个地区落后，哪种产品进度慢，党委书记就带领群众突击薄弱环节，使收购运动全面地、均衡地向前发展。特别是经过8月份开始的反右倾、鼓干劲，商业战线上的群众运动，更加高涨。棉花征购任务，在新棉上市不到两个月以后，就提前五个月完成年计划。
    商业部门职工在各级党委领导下，一方面大力展开收购宣传工作，一方面创造了许多适应大搞群众运动的工作方法。当广大群众掀起多卖少留、积极向国家送售农副产品高潮的时候，各地商业部门就采取突击收购与经常收购相结合、定点收购与流动收购相结合、门市收购与组织群众代购相结合、收购与加工调运相结合等方法，便利农民出售农副产品。今年收购的农副产品不仅数量比任何一年都要多，而且质量也比以往任何一年好。
    在农副产品收购工作中，衡山县大浦等五个公社供销部“一处有经验，四处传播，一处有困难，四处支援”的共产主义协作竞赛的经验，在省委领导下普及到了全省。现在全省已涌现出标兵三万九千多人，先进单位六千多个，有力地推动和促进了农副产品收购运动。在竞赛过程中，各级商业部门召开的经验交流现场协作会议有两千多次，全省性的协作竞赛、经验交流会一百多次，使收购高潮一浪高过一浪地向前发展。
