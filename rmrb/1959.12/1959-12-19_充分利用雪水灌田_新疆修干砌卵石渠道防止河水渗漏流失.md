Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi – Various regions in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are universally utilizing riverbed cobblestones to construct dry-laid cobblestone canals near the upper reaches of many large rivers, diverting river water into the canals and then into irrigation areas. This practice prevents river water seepage, erosion, and loss, thereby improving the effective utilization rate of river water and expanding and improving irrigation areas. According to a survey by the water conservancy department, once the more than forty newly constructed dry-laid cobblestone canals this year are completed, along with the fifty-six canals built in the past, they will completely change the original state of 80% of the region's river channels with severe seepage and loss.

The dry-laid cobblestone canals that the Autonomous Region started constructing this year generally have a diversion capacity of about twenty cubic meters per second. Among them, large-scale canals such as the Manas River East Bank Canal, the Yarkand River East and West Bank Canals, and the Hutubi River Youth Canal have diversion flows as high as sixty to one hundred forty cubic meters per second, with larger projects than in any previous year. Currently, hundreds of thousands of commune members across the Autonomous Region, led by local Party committee secretaries at all levels, are digging canals and transporting cobblestones on the Gobi Desert, building and paving as they go. Many construction sites have achieved an average efficiency of five to six cubic meters of Gobi soil and rock excavated per person per day.

The large and small rivers within Xinjiang are formed by the convergence of melting ice and snow from various mountain ranges. After these snowmelt waters flow out of the mountain pass, they mostly have to pass through ten to dozens of kilometers of Gobi cobblestone areas before flowing into irrigation areas. In the spring, the snowmelt flow from the mountains is small. After passing through the long gravel alluvial layer, most of the water seeps away and is lost before reaching the irrigation area. Even for large rivers, the water flowing into the irrigation area does not reach 30% to 40% of the total river flow. However, during the floods of July and August, the flow is particularly large. Due to the lack of fixed riverbeds, the water overflows and erodes, often causing flood disasters. Building dry-laid cobblestone canals allows these rivers to enter fixed riverbeds (i.e., canals) as soon as they exit the mountain pass, solving the above two problems. For example, Uyghur commune members at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains built the more than thirty-kilometer-long dry-laid cobblestone Kunlun Canal on the upper reaches of the Keriya River. Before the canal was built, the river lost 3% of its water per kilometer to seepage from April to June each year. This year, the seepage loss per kilometer has been reduced to 0.73%. During the same period, the water flowing into the irrigation area has increased by nearly two times compared to before, not only improving the irrigation conditions of the original 250,000 mu of cultivated land but also expanding the irrigation area by nearly 200,000 mu.

The materials for building dry-laid cobblestone canals are the abundant cobblestones near the riverbeds. This method of canal construction is simpler than the technique of using cement mortar to lay cobblestones, making it easier for the majority of commune members to master. At the same time, it is inexpensive and can save a significant amount of investment.

### 充分利用雪水灌田  新疆修干砌卵石渠道防止河水渗漏流失

    充分利用雪水灌田
    新疆修干砌卵石渠道防止河水渗漏流失
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区各地普遍利用河床卵石，在许多大河上游附近修筑干砌卵石渠道，将河水引到渠中，再流入灌区。这样作，可以防止河水渗漏、冲刷、流失，提高河水的有效利用率，扩大和改善灌溉面积。据水利部门调查，今年新修的四十多条干砌卵石渠道完工后，连同过去兴修的五十六条渠道，就可使全自治区80％渗漏流失严重的河道，彻底改变原来的面貌。
    自治区今年开工的干砌卵石渠道，一般引水量达二十秒立方米左右，其中玛纳斯河东岸大渠、叶尔羌河东西两岸大渠和呼图壁河青年渠等大型渠道，引水流量高达六十至一百四十秒立方米，工程大于以往任何一年。目前全自治区有数十万社员正在当地各级党委书记的带领下，在戈壁滩上一面挖渠，一面搬运卵石，随修渠、随铺砌。不少工地平均每人每天挖戈壁土石的效率达到五、六立方米。
    新疆境内的大、小河流，都由各山脉融化的冰雪汇集形成。这些冰雪融化的水流出山口后，大多要经过十多公里到数十公里的戈壁卵石地带，才能流入灌区。春季山上的雪水流量小，一经过漫长的砾石冲积层，大部分水还没有流到灌区就渗漏流失完了，即使是大河，流入灌区的水也达不到整个河水流量的30％到40％，而7、8月间洪水一到，流量又特别大，由于没有固定河床，水流漫溢冲刷，经常发生洪水灾害。修筑干砌卵石渠道，使这些河流一出山口就进入固定河床（即渠道），便解决了上述两个问题。例如昆仑山下维吾尔族社员，在克里亚河上游修筑了一条三十多公里长的干砌卵石昆仑大渠。修渠前，这条河每年4月至6月流入灌区的水，每公里要渗漏3％，今年每公里渗漏量已降低到0.73％，在同一时期流入灌区的水比以前增加了近两倍，不仅改善了原来二十五万亩耕地的灌溉状况，还可以扩大灌溉面积近二十万亩。
    修筑干砌卵石渠道，材料就是河道附近的大量卵石。这种筑渠方法，比用水泥浆砌卵石的技术简单，最容易为广大社员所掌握。同时，造价低廉，可以节省大量投资。
