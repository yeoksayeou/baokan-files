　　"Grain Seas Roll, Golden Mountains Shake, People Laugh, Heaven Laughs, Earth Laughs Too" - Celebrations of a Bumper Harvest Everywhere in the Two Hundred Li Rice Granary
　　A Year of Extraordinary Harvest in Luchuan
　　Wang Ying, First Secretary of the CCP Luchuan County Committee, Guangxi

　　In 1959, Luchuan County achieved an all-round and extraordinary bumper harvest in industrial and agricultural production. “Grain seas roll, golden mountains shake, people laugh, heaven laughs, earth laughs too.” Celebrations echoed everywhere in the two hundred li rice granary, celebrating this year's glorious achievements.

　　A Sea of Red
　　Over the past year, our county's production campaign has been vigorous, thorough, meticulous, and sustained. From early spring to the end of the year, the campaign surged wave upon wave. More than 300,000 people in the county unleashed soaring enthusiasm and created extraordinary achievements. The total output of more than 340,000 mu of double-season rice increased by 70% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The average yield per mu was 1,309 jin, exceeding the targets set by the Agricultural Development Program Outline by eight years ahead of schedule. All nine people's communes in the county exceeded 1,000 jin per mu, and more than 60,000 mu of high-yielding fields produced over 2,000 jin per mu. The number of the famous Guangxi "Luchuan pigs" at the end of the year totaled more than 182,000 head, averaging 2.4 head per household, an increase of 52.3% compared to 1958. Chickens, ducks, fish, and forestry have also made considerable progress. More than 300 "flower and fruit mountains" have been opened up throughout the county, with orchards covering more than 61,000 mu and over 12 million fruit seedlings. The total income from sideline occupations for the year was more than 11.21 million yuan, an increase of 19% compared to 1958.

　　Industrial development has been even faster. In addition to county-run industries, each commune has its own machinery repair and assembly plant and processing plant, and each commune has built a small hydropower station. The total industrial output value was more than 26 million yuan, an increase of 158% compared to 1958.

　　The total industrial and agricultural output value of the county reached 73.43 million yuan, an increase of 71% compared to 1958. At the end of the year, more than 90% of commune members increased their income. This is the glorious victory of the General Line and the tremendous change brought about by the continued Great Leap Forward in the first year after the people's communes.

　　Full of Enthusiasm
　　Over the past year, we have deeply realized that only by continuously revolutionizing on the ideological front can we guarantee the continuous leap forward in the production campaign. The production process this year has experienced sharp and profound ideological struggles. The county party committee has closely grasped the main ideological problems of cadres and the masses in each period and carried out ideological work in a timely manner. The county party committee led the people of the county to carry out a major summary, showcasing the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and highlighting the superiority of the people's communes. The entire county was of one mind, determined to achieve more than 1,000 jin per mu and determined to fly side by side with high-yield areas. The spring plowing upsurge was launched vigorously, and 80% of the paddy fields were deep-plowed. After August, with the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party as the guiding principle, the enthusiasm of the whole people was further boosted, and the contract production campaign rose step by step. In less than fifteen days, the busy autumn harvest and winter planting tasks were successfully completed. Compared with previous autumn harvests and winter plantings, one day was equivalent to three days, and one person was equivalent to three people. Over the past year, due to grasping political and ideological matters, cadres and the masses have always maintained strong fighting spirit, and the production campaign has moved from victory to greater victory.

　　Dissecting the "Sparrow" to Guide the Overall Situation
　　In the mass movement of the Great Leap Forward, various tasks became more and more meticulous, and new situations, new problems, and new experiences emerged continuously. How can leaders see clearly, grasp steadily, make decisive decisions, and guide the movement to move forward continuously in this turbulent torrent? This is an art. Over the past year, the county party committee, according to Chairman Mao's thought, has learned and applied the method of dissecting the "sparrow," gained some experience, and achieved results in practice. This year's early rice field management is an example. The central issue of field management is to eliminate the three categories of seedlings and promote the uniformity of each plot of seedlings into one category. However, the county party committee had no idea about the standards and causes of the three categories of seedlings at that time. Therefore, when transplanting was about to end, the county party committee went to the Lulou Brigade, where transplanting was progressing faster, and together with the cadres and farmers, appraised each plot of land and conducted on-the-spot diagnoses. Finally, all the three categories of seedlings were divided into six types, and prescriptions were drawn up to treat the symptoms accordingly. In the past, people often regarded excessively luxuriant seedlings as the first category of seedlings. After dissecting the "sparrow," everyone agreed that such seedlings were prone to lodging early, resulting in serious yield reduction. Therefore, this year, some seedlings with excessively vigorous leaves were classified as the third category of seedlings. After dissecting the "sparrow," a field meeting was immediately held, and the county's field management campaign suddenly set off a climax, and the three categories of seedlings were continuously upgraded.

　　Inserting Red Flags and Establishing Pace-Setters
　　We believe that a successful typical example reveals the objective laws of things and reflects the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses; it not only establishes the correct direction but also points out specific methods and paths. Therefore, using typical examples to educate the masses has a strong persuasiveness and spreads quickly, often surpassing thousands of words of meeting reports. The county party committee has always emphasized that leading cadres must personally focus on key areas, insert red flags, and establish pace-setters. Over the past year, in agriculture, we have established and promoted the advanced banners of Lulou, Gucheng, and Bingtang Brigades. In the central campaign of each period, we paid more attention to cultivating pace-setting figures, such as launching the transplanting expert campaign, the harvesting expert campaign, and the deep-plowing expert campaign, setting off a county-wide mass movement of chasing and catching up. Qi Yueying, a transplanting expert from Lulou Brigade, transplanted 1.8 mu per day. After the leadership discovered this, they launched a "learn from Yueying" competition craze throughout the brigade. Within a few days, all 189 transplanters in the brigade exceeded 1 mu per day. Since the beginning of this year, we have used considerable effort to systematically publicize the "New Seven Women" and the "Old Seven Women," vigorously promoting the two red flags of high-yield experimental fields. The deeds of the "Double Seven Women" have spread widely throughout the county, the prefecture, and even the autonomous region, driving the entire county and forming a mass movement where everyone is engaged in high-yield fields. Due to the pioneering spirit of the masses, Luchuan's high-yield field campaign this year has developed into a new stage of multi-point experimentation, which is scattered like stars. This has played a decisive role in the overall high-yield production of the county. When establishing flags, we not only pay attention to grasping the advanced but also grasping the typical examples of backward transformations. The Mapo Commune was originally one of the most backward communes in the county. This year, they greatly boosted their enthusiasm and challenged the most advanced Qinghu Commune, determined to catch up with Qinghu. They focused on both high-yield fields and low-yield fields. As a result, the average yield per mu of late rice was 896 jin, and more than 22,000 mu of low-yield fields basically caught up with high-yield fields. The county party committee held an on-the-spot meeting here, using them as a model to profoundly educate various communes throughout the county, enabling the advanced to overcome complacency and narrow-minded empiricism, and allowing the backward to greatly liberate their thinking and compete to move upstream.

　　Setting Up Platforms and Holding Competitions
　　From practical work, we have deeply realized that small-scale leadership of production is cold and deserted, and production cannot be done well, which will "cause good fields to grow crooked seedlings and fertile land to become barren slopes"; on the contrary, if a vigorous mass movement is launched, "low yield will become high yield, and poor mountains will become rich mountains." Therefore, in each production stage, we fully utilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses through mass competitive movements.

　　Setting up platforms is a competitive form most loved by the masses. Each time a platform is set up, not only do communes compare plans, measures, and achievements with communes, and brigades with brigades, but also people compare enthusiasm and actions with each other, which has greatly promoted production. For example, in the early rice production this year, the Seven Women High-Yield Group of Bingtang Brigade in Chengxiang Commune first set up a high-yield platform competition, and suddenly many sister high-yield fields, brother high-yield fields, husband and wife high-yield fields, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law high-yield fields, etc., appeared throughout the county; forming a magnificent high-yield field competition. One-third of the fields in the county became high-yield fields.

　　In order to promote balanced production increase in late rice production, we implemented the method of centralized leadership, centralized labor, and concentrated fine fertilizer, adapting to local conditions, classifying and ranking, and carrying out mass movements to comprehensively transform low-yield fields. Tens of thousands of cadres and masses throughout the county formed expeditions to go up the mountains, living in the mountain valleys, eating in the mountain valleys, urging the seedlings to grow during the day, and accompanying the seedlings to sleep at night, finally enabling more than 120,000 mu of low-yield fields throughout the county to catch up with high-yield fields in one fell swoop.

　　In the process of vigorous development of the mass movement, we constantly guide the masses to summarize practical experience, so that revolutionary enthusiasm is combined with scientific attitude. For example, during the yellow ripening period of early and late rice, more than 100,000 people were mobilized to conduct field summaries, affirming important measures such as rational close planting, rational fertilization, promotion of good seeds, deep plowing, and "three-light" weeding, which played an active role in the normal and healthy development of the movement.

　　Grasping the Center and Arranging Comprehensively
　　Party organizations at all levels in the county have made it clear that agriculture is the foundation, with industry and agriculture developing side by side in an all-round way. In work arrangements, it is emphasized to grasp the center and take care of the overall situation. Grasping the center means concentrating superior forces, mobilizing all manpower and material resources, and implementing short-term assaults. For example, after transplanting, 90,000 people assaulted for three days, picking 2 million dan of green manure, ensuring the needs of weeding and topdressing. After field management, 60,000 people assaulted for seven days, opening up and expanding the planting of cassava by 290,000 mu, and then autumn harvest. The 340,000 mu of late rice were harvested in half a month. This method is a high-efficiency method in the current situation where there is a shortage of rural labor and agriculture is highly seasonal. It avoids the passive situation of dividing forces, being stretched thin, and dragging everything out. Moreover, it is emphasized that the tail should not drag the center, that is, when the previous center becomes a climax and is close to completion, it is timely to switch to the next center, using the next center to drive the cleanup of the previous one, one center after another, one climax after another. Taking care of the overall situation means implementing separate line leadership for various tasks outside the center.

　　On the basis of the all-round Great Leap Forward in 1959, the people of Luchuan County are full of ambition and determined to strive for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

　　“粮海滚、金山摇，人笑天笑地也笑”  二百里米粮川里到处欢歌庆丰收
    陆川特大丰收的一年
　　中共广西陆川县委会第一书记　王英
    1959年，陆川县工农业生产获得了全面的特大丰收。“粮海滚、金山摇，人笑天笑地也笑”。二百里米粮川里到处欢歌，庆祝今年来的辉煌成就。
　　满堂红
    一年来，我们县的生产运动，势大力猛，深入细致，全面持久，从春初到年终，运动一浪高于一浪。全县三十多万群众，发挥了冲天干劲，创造出非凡的成绩。三十四万多亩双季水稻，总产量比大跃进的1958年增产七成。平均每亩产量一千三百零九斤，提前八年超额实现了农业发展纲要所规定的指标。全县九个人民公社亩产都超过了千斤，并且出现了六万多亩亩产两千斤的高额丰产田。广西有名的“陆川猪”年底存栏数共有十八万二千多头，平均每户二点四头，比1958年增长52.3％。鸡、鸭、鱼、林业也都有了长足的发展。全县开辟了三百多座花果山，果林面积有六万一千多亩，果苗一千二百多万株。全年副业收入一千一百二十一万多元，比1958年增长19％。
    工业发展更快。除县办工业外，每个公社都有机械修配厂、加工厂，社社办起了小型水电站。工业总产值二千六百多万元，比1958年增长158％。
    全县工农业总产值达到七千三百四十三万元，比1958年增长71％。年终分配，90％以上的社员增加了收入。这是总路线的光辉胜利，是人民公社化后第一年继续大跃进带来的巨大变化。全民鼓足干劲
    一年来，我们深深体会到，只有在思想战线上不断革命，才能保证生产运动的不断跃进。这一年的生产过程，经历着尖锐的深刻的思想斗争。县委在每个时期都紧紧抓住干部和群众的主要思想问题，及时地开展思想工作。县委领导全县人民开展了一次大总结，大摆1958年大跃进的成就和经验，大讲人民公社的优越性。全县上下一条心，坚决要实现亩产超千斤，立志要和高产地区比翼齐飞。春耕高潮轰轰烈烈掀起来，80％的稻田进行了深耕。8月份以后，又以党的八届八中全会的决议为纲，进一步鼓足全民的干劲，超包产运动步步高升。不到十五天，就胜利完成了繁忙的秋收冬种任务，比起历年秋收冬种，真是一天顶三天，一人顶三人。一年来，由于抓紧了政治思想这一关，使干部群众始终保持旺盛的斗志，生产运动从胜利走向更大的胜利。
　　解剖“麻雀”指导全盘
    在大跃进的群众运动中，各种工作越做越细致，新情况、新问题、新经验不断涌现。领导者在这汹涌澎湃的洪流中，如何看得准，掌握得稳，当机立断，指导运动不断前进，这是一门艺术。一年来，县委根据毛主席的思想，学习运用解剖“麻雀”的方法，有了一些体会，并且在实践中取得了成效。今年早稻的田间管理，就是一个例子。田间管理的中心问题是消灭三类禾，促使块块禾苗一类化。但是，三类禾的标准和形成原因是什么，县委当时是心中无数的。于是，在插秧即将结束的时候，县委就到插秧进展较快的陆落大队，和干部农民一道，将一垌田逐块地鉴定和临田诊断，最后，把所有的三类禾苗，分为六种类型，分别拟定了处方，对症下药。过去，人们往往把生长过于繁茂的禾苗，看作一类禾，经过解剖“麻雀”，大家一致认为这样的禾苗容易早期倒伏，以致造成严重减产。因此今年把一部分禾叶过于旺盛的禾苗，划为三类禾。解剖“麻雀”之后，立即召开现场会议，全县田间管理运动顿时卷起高潮，三类禾连连升级。
　　插红旗　树标兵
    我们认为，一个成功的典型，它揭示了事物的客观规律性，又反映了群众的革命干劲；既树立了正确的方向，又指出了具体的方法途径。因此，用典型教育群众，其说服力之强，风行之快，往往胜过千言万语的会议报告。县委一贯强调，领导干部一定要亲自搞重点，插红旗，树标兵。一年来，在农业上，我们树立和宣传了陆落、古城、并塘等大队的先进旗帜。在每个时期的中心运动中，更注意培养标兵人物，如开展插秧能手运动，收割能手运动，深耕能手运动，掀起全县性的你追我赶的群众运动热潮。陆落大队插秧能手戚月英，日插一亩八分，领导发现以后，在全队开展“学月英”的竞赛热潮，几天之间，全队一百八十九个插秧手都超过了日插一亩。今年以来，我们用了相当的力量，系统地宣传“新七女”、“老七女”，大搞丰产试验田的两面红旗，双七女的事迹传闻之广，遍及县内、专区内、以至自治区，带动了全县，形成人人大搞丰产田的群众运动。由于群众的首创精神，今年陆川的丰产田运动，发展到了一个成为星罗棋布的多点试验的新阶段，这对于全县普遍高额丰产，起了决定性的作用。在树立旗帜的时候，我们不仅注意抓先进的，而且抓落后转变为先进的典型。马坡公社原是全县最落后的公社之一，今年他们大鼓干劲，向最先进的清湖公社挑战，立志赶清湖。他们既抓高产田，又抓低产田，结果，晚造平均亩产八百九十六斤，两万二千多亩低产田基本赶上了高产田。县委在这里召开了现场会，把它们作为榜样，深刻地教育了全县各个公社，使先进的克服了自满情绪和狭隘经验主义，使落后的思想大解放，竞争上游。
　　打擂台　闹竞赛
    从实际工作中，我们深刻体会到，小手小脚的领导生产，冷冷清清，生产搞不好，会使“好田长歪禾，肥地变荒坡”；反之，如果开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动，就会“低产变高产，穷山变富山”。因此，在每一个生产阶段，我们都通过群众性的竞赛运动，把广大群众的积极性充分发挥起来。
    打擂台是一种群众最喜爱的竞赛形式，每次打擂台，不仅公社与公社、大队与大队之间比计划、比措施、比成绩，就是人与人之间，也比干劲，比行动，对生产起了很大的推动作用。比如今年早造，城厢公社并塘大队七女丰产小组，首先摆出了丰产擂台赛，顿时在全县范围内出现了许许多多姊妹丰产田、兄弟丰产田、夫妻丰产田、婆媳丰产田……等等；形成一个气势磅礴的丰产田大竞赛。全县有三分之一的田亩成为丰产田。
    为了促使平衡增产，在晚造生产中，我们实行了集中领导、集中劳力、集中精肥，因地制宜，分类排队的办法，开展群众运动，对低产田进行全面地改造。全县数万干部和群众，组成远征队上山，住在山冲，食在山冲，日催禾苗长，夜伴禾苗眠，终于使全县十二万多亩低产田一举赶上了高产田。
    在群众运动蓬勃开展的过程中，我们不断引导群众总结实践经验，做到革命干劲与科学态度相结合，如在早、晚稻黄熟时，发动十万多人进行田间大总结，肯定了合理密植、合理施肥、推广良种、深耕、“三光”除草等重要措施，这对运动的正常地、健康地发展，起了积极的作用。
　　抓住中心　全面安排
    全县各级党组织，都明确以农业为基础，工农业并举，全面发展的方针。在工作安排上，既强调抓好中心，又要照顾全盘。抓中心，就是集中优势兵力，动员一切人力物力，实行短期突击。如插秧以后，九万人突击三天，采青二百万担，保证了耘田追肥需要。田间管理之后，六万人突击七天，开荒扩种木薯二十九万亩，然后秋收。三十四万亩晚稻，突击在半个月收割完。这种方法，在目前农村劳动力不足而农业季节性又强的情况下，是一种高效率的方法。它避免了分兵出击，捉襟见肘，事事拖尾巴的被动局面。而且，强调不让尾巴拖住中心，即前一个中心既成高潮，接近收尾，就及时转入下一个中心，用下一个中心带动前一个扫尾，一个中心接着一个中心，一个高潮跟着一个高潮。照顾全盘，就是中心之外的各项工作，实行分线领导。
    在1959年全面大跃进的基础上，陆川县人民雄心百倍，立志在1960年争取更好更全面的跃进。
