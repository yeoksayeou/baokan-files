Tianjin, December 15th (Reported by our newspaper) – A new cooperative relationship of "large factories helping small factories" has been widely established in Nankai District, Tianjin.

In the large factories in various industries in this district, from the Party committee secretary and factory director to the workers, everyone regards helping small factories overcome difficulties as their own responsibility. They have helped forty to fifty medium and small factories throughout the district to vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization, enabling most of the technical innovation plans of these factories to be realized ahead of schedule. Many small factories, with the help of large factories, have re-formulated new plans after the majority of their original plans were realized.

Since November, the workers of many small factories in Nankai District have been enthusiastically engaged in technical innovation. However, due to the weak technical strength of these small factories, some factories only have one or two maintenance workers or mechanics, so progress is very slow. Taking the Era Sock Factory, which has more than 700 workers, as an example, after they transformed a manually operated sock-stitching machine into a mechanized and semi-automated one, the factory decided to promote it universally on all forty-four sock-stitching machines in the factory. However, the factory only had three maintenance workers, a few wrenches, and a vise. It was difficult to guarantee the quality and produce the precision parts such as large pipes fitting into small pipes, milling eyes inside, and knurling the teeth outside. They were staring at the new technology, unable to put it into production.

In response to the above situation, the Nankai District Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call for large factories to help small factories, and then studied specific methods. The first method was to form eight professional groups of casting, forging, weaving, knitting, rubber, shoe-making, tube drawing and rolling, and printing and dyeing, by grouping large and small factories in the same industry or the same type of work. Taking large factories as the main force, they concentrated their efforts to help realize key projects; after success, they studied each other, unified the appraisal, selected the most ideal equipment, or improved measures, divided the responsibilities by factory, and jointly took responsibility. One factory succeeded, and all factories benefited. As a result of implementing this measure, equipment such as iron smashing machines and sand screening machines in the eleven casting workshops in the district, which were originally scheduled to be realized from January to March next year, can be realized in mid-December. The second method is that large factories in different industries deliver "treasures" to small factories, and small factories actively contact large factories; if small factories encounter difficulties, large factories provide full support. The third method is that when small factories encounter difficulties in tackling relatively complex technologies, large factories send technical personnel to help. For example, the Tianjin Knitwear Factory has created an automatic glove-knitting machine that can complete all the processes of glove-knitting with one machine, which can increase the efficiency of each machine by five times. However, everything was ready for this creation, except that a small hole often appeared in the place where the glove fingers were divided. At this time, the No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, the General Weaving Factory, the Tractor Factory, the Internal Combustion Engine Factory, and the Nankai District Science and Technology Committee each sent an engineer to help the Knitwear Factory solve complex design problems. In order to better help small factories realize mechanization and semi-mechanization more, faster, better, and more economically, large factories in various industries have generally organized amateur processing factories or collaborative shock brigades; they have adopted methods such as mobilizing workers to use their spare time and collecting waste materials to ensure the timely realization of various collaborative projects.

In the process of helping small factories, many large factories have put ideology first and carried out communist collaboration ideology education for the vast number of workers. The Party Committee of the Internal Combustion Engine Factory found that a small number of workers had once shown resentment. The Party Committee Secretary held a symposium to explain the political and economic significance of supporting small factories. The Party Committee of the Tractor Factory also proposed that support for small factories should only be done well, not badly, only ahead of schedule, not behind schedule. In order to support small factories, the gear group of this factory vigorously carried out technical innovation, adjusted labor organization, and contracted all the gear processing tasks required for the technical innovation of various factories in the district. The Era Sock Factory was transformed into a mechanized and semi-automated factory with the full support of the Tractor Factory. The large factory helped them, and they also did their best to help even smaller factories. The workers of this factory contracted the Fuyuan Sock Factory. The workers said, whatever we have, Fuyuan can also have; whatever we transform, Fuyuan can also transform. When the workers of the Fuyuan Sock Factory failed to modify the sock-stitching machine, the Era Sock Factory sent a modified machine to the Fuyuan Sock Factory, and the veteran workers disassembled and assembled the machine again and again, teaching the workers of the Fuyuan Sock Factory hand-in-hand.

### 天津南开区各工厂在技术革新中建立新的协作关系  大厂帮小厂加速机械化

    天津南开区各工厂在技术革新中建立新的协作关系
    大厂帮小厂加速机械化
    本报天津15日电　“大厂帮小厂”的新的协作关系，已在天津南开区普遍建立。
    在这个区各行各业的大厂里，从党委书记、厂长到工人，都把帮助小厂克服困难当作是自己的责任。他们帮助了全区四、五十个中、小工厂大搞机械化和半机械化，使这些工厂的技术革新规划绝大部分项目都能够提前实现。不少的小厂，因为有大厂的帮助，在原定的规划大部分实现以后，又重新制订了新规划。
    11月份以来，南开区许多小厂的职工们欢欣鼓舞地大搞技术革新。但是由于这些小厂技术力量薄弱，有些工厂只有一、二个保全工或机修工，因此进展很慢。以有七百多个职工的时代袜厂为例，他们把一台手工操作的织袜口机改成机械化和半自动化以后，工厂决定在全厂的四十四台织袜口机上普遍推广。可是全厂只有三个保全工，几把搬子和一台老虎钳，既难保证质量，也很难生产那种大管子套小管子，里面铣眼，外面滚花的牙轮等精密零件。眼瞪着新技术不能投入生产。
  中共南开区委针对上述情况，提出了大厂帮小厂的号召，接着又研究了具体的作法。第一种作法是将同一个行业或同一个工种的大小工厂组成了铸造、锻工、织布、针织、橡胶、制鞋、拔管轧片、印染等八个专业组。以大厂为主，集中力量，帮助实现重点项目；成功以后，互相研究，统一鉴定，选出最理想的设备，或改进的措施，分厂包干，共同负责，一厂成功，厂厂有分。推行这一措施的结果，全区十一个铸工车间，原订明年1月到3月才能实现的砸铁机、筛砂机等设备，在12月中旬就可实现。第二种作法是不同行业的大小工厂之间，大厂送“宝”上门，小厂主动联系；小厂一有困难，大厂全力支援。第三种作法，当小厂猛攻比较复杂的技术遇有困难的时候，大厂派出技术人员予以帮助。例如天津市线衣厂创造了自动织手套的机器，能把织手套的全部工序，由一台机器来完成，这样可以提高各台效率五倍。可是这项创造，万事已经俱备，只有在手套分指头的地方，常常会出现一个小洞。这时，棉纺六厂、织布总厂、拖拉机厂、内燃机厂和南开区科学技术委员会各派出了一个工程师，专门帮助线衣厂解决复杂的设计问题。各行各业的大型工厂，为了更好地帮助小厂多快好省地实现机械化和半机械化，一般都组织了业余加工厂或协作突击队；采取发动职工利用业余时间、收集废旧物资等方法，保证了各项协作项目的按时实现。
    在帮助小厂的过程中，许多大厂都作到了思想先行，对广大职工进行了共产主义协作思想的教育。内燃机厂党委会发现少数职工一度出现过埋怨情绪，党委书记就召开了座谈会，讲清支援小厂的政治意义和经济意义。拖拉机厂党委还提出支援小厂只许做好，不许做坏，只许提前，不许拉后。这个厂的齿轮小组为了支援小厂，就大搞技术革新，调整劳动组织，把全区各厂实现技术革新所需用的齿轮加工任务全部包了下来。时代织袜厂就是在拖拉机厂全部包干支援的情况下，改成机械化半自动化的。大厂帮助了他们，他们对比自己还小的工厂也尽全力进行了帮助。这个厂的职工包下了福缘袜厂。职工们说，我们有什么，福缘也能有什么；我们改造什么，福缘就能改造什么。当福缘袜厂的工人在改装织袜口机遭到失败时，时代袜厂就把一台改装好了的机器送给福缘袜厂，老工人们还把这台机器，拆了又装，装了又拆，把着手教会了福缘袜厂的工人。
