Xinhua News Agency, 11th — The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee sent a telegram today to the African National Congress of South Africa, warmly congratulating them on the convocation of the 47th Annual Conference of the African National Congress of South Africa.

The telegram said, "The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee extends its heartfelt respect to the South African people who are engaged in an unremitting struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination."

The telegram said: "The Chinese people sternly condemn the racial discrimination and apartheid policies imposed on the South African people.

The telegram said, "The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and resolutely supported the just struggle of the South African people. We firmly believe that today, when the strength of the world's people far exceeds that of imperialism, and today, when the African people are increasingly awakening and uniting, as long as the South African people persist in their struggle, they will surely be able to win final victory. We wish the conference new and greater achievements."

We have always given deep sympathy and full support to the South African people's struggle against racial discrimination, for democratic rights, and for improved living conditions."

The telegram concluded, "We wish the conference will contribute to advancing this just struggle, and we wish the South African people victory in this struggle."

The telegram said, "The women and people of South Africa, together, regardless of the South African Federal Government's frenzied persecution and brutal suppression, have waged an indomitable and heroic struggle against colonialism, for freedom, and against racial discrimination. We Chinese women feel heartfelt admiration. We deeply sympathize with and care about your just struggle, and we stand firmly with you. We firmly believe that the united South African people and women, with the sympathy and support of the peace-loving, just, and free people of Africa and the world, will surely achieve final victory."
