Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 18th: The eleventh session of the Vietnam National Assembly solemnly opened in Hanoi this morning. Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnam National Assembly, delivered the opening speech at the eleventh session of the National Assembly today.

He said that this National Assembly session is being held at the end of 1959, a crucial year of the national three-year plan (1958-1960). At this time, North Vietnam is advancing steadily and rapidly on the road of transforming and developing the economy and developing culture. The victory of 1959 will promote the realization of the national plan for 1960.

Ton Duc Thang said that the South Vietnamese people's struggle for national reunification, democracy, freedom, and improved living standards is rising daily. The US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's policy of suppression and persecution is bound to fail. He warmly praised the heroic fighting spirit of the South Vietnamese people.

Ton Duc Thang said that this National Assembly meeting will discuss some major issues closely related to the Vietnamese people. First, it will discuss and adopt the new constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, discuss and adopt the Election Law and the Family and Marriage Law; at the same time, according to the government work report, it will summarize the country's work in 1959 and decide on the direction of work in 1960.

After Ton Duc Thang delivered the opening speech, he gave a work report on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly since the tenth session of the National Assembly.

President Ho Chi Minh then delivered a congratulatory message to the assembly and, on behalf of the Constitution Revision Committee, gave a report on the draft new constitution to all National Assembly delegates. At this time, the entire audience stood up, and thunderous applause lasted for a long time.

In his congratulatory message, President Ho said that at present, all the people of North Vietnam, from cities to rural areas, from factories and construction sites to agricultural cooperatives, from the army to government agencies and schools, are carrying out patriotic emulation movements and have achieved good results.

President Ho Chi Minh said that in South Vietnam, our people are also united and carrying out a heroic struggle against the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique. President Ho, on behalf of the National Assembly, extended cordial greetings to all the people of South Vietnam.

In his report on the draft new constitution, President Ho outlined the historical situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence and the establishment of a people's democratic system, as well as the first Vietnamese constitution passed by the Second National Assembly in 1946. He said that the 1946 Constitution was suitable for the situation and revolutionary tasks at that time. It has completed its historical mission. Now, this constitution is not suitable for the current new situation and new revolutionary tasks. Therefore, we must revise this constitution. He said that the draft new constitution has been studied and discussed by cadres and people of all walks of life. In addition to the opinions provided by the people of North Vietnam, the Constitution Revision Committee has also received many letters from the people of South Vietnam and overseas Vietnamese providing opinions.

President Ho said that the draft new constitution records the victories that the Vietnamese people have achieved over the years and puts forward the revolutionary tasks for the new historical period. He said that this constitution will further promote the Vietnamese people's enthusiasm for loving the motherland and socialism, mobilize the people to unite more closely, and work harder to carry out emulation to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

When elaborating on the main contents of the new constitution, President Ho first talked about the nature of the state organs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said that the preamble of the draft new constitution stipulates: "Our country is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance." He said that in order to build socialism and achieve national reunification, we must continuously strengthen the leadership of the working class over the people's democratic regime. The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of the state organs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

President Ho said that Vietnam is a unified multi-ethnic country, and all ethnic groups living on Vietnamese soil are equal in rights and obligations.

President Ho Chi Minh spoke about the general line for the transition to socialism in North Vietnam, saying that Article 9 of the draft new constitution stipulates that the general line for our country's transition to socialism is: to carry out the socialist transformation and development of the national economy, so that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam can move from the people's democratic system to the socialist road, and transform the backward economy into a socialist economy with modern industrial and agricultural production and advanced science and technology. The economic policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the continuous development of production in order to continuously improve the material and cultural life of the people.

He said that the purpose of our system is to abolish non-socialist private ownership and rely on ownership by the whole people and collective ownership to transform the multi-component economy into a single economy. The state-owned economy is owned by the whole people, it leads the national economy, and the regime must guarantee its priority development.

Speaking of the national organization of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, President Ho said that in order to properly realize the revolutionary tasks, our government must develop the democracy and political rights of the entire people to give play to the people's initiative and creativity, so that every Vietnamese citizen can effectively participate in the work of managing the country, and vigorously fight for socialist construction and for the realization of national reunification.

President Ho said that the draft new constitution stipulates that all power in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam belongs to the people. The people exercise their power through the National Assembly and people's councils at all levels that they elect themselves and are responsible to the people.

President Ho said that the draft new constitution also stipulates that the task of all government agencies is to rely on the people, closely contact the people, listen to the opinions of the people, and be supervised by the people.

President Ho spoke about the basic rights and obligations of citizens, pointing out that the provisions made in the draft new constitution show that our system is truly democratic in nature.

After President Ho finished his report, he suggested that after the National Assembly meeting passes the new constitution, it allow the government to announce the new constitution on January 1st of next year.

President Ho's report was constantly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    新华社河内18日电　越南国会第十一次会议今天上午在河内隆重开幕。越南国会常务委员会委员长孙德胜今天在国会第十一次会议上致开幕词。
    他说，这届国会是在国家三年计划（1958—1960）带关键性的一年——1959年的年底举行的，这个时候，越南北方正在改造和发展经济、发展文化的道路上稳步而迅速地前进。1959年的胜利将促进1960年国家计划的实现。
    孙德胜说，南越人民要求祖国统一、民主、自由和改善生活的斗争正在日益高涨。美国—吴庭艳集团的镇压迫害政策必将遭到失败。他热烈地赞扬了南越人民的英勇斗争精神。
    孙德胜说，这次国会会议将讨论同越南人民密切相关的一些重大问题。首先讨论和通过越南民主共和国的新宪法，讨论和通过选举法、家庭和婚姻法；同时根据政府工作报告，总结国家1959年的工作和决定1960年的工作方向。
    孙德胜致开幕词后，代表国会常务委员会作了国会第十次会议以来的工作报告。
    胡志明主席接着向大会致贺词，并代表修改宪法委员会向全体国会代表作关于新宪法草案的报告。这时全场起立，雷鸣般的掌声经久不息。
    胡主席在贺词中说，目前，越南北方全体人民，从城市到农村，从工厂、工地到农业社，从部队到机关、学校，正在开展爱国竞赛运动，并取得了良好的成绩。
    胡志明主席说，在越南南方，我国人民也正在团结一致，对美国—吴庭艳集团进行英勇的斗争。胡主席代表国会向南越全体人民致以亲切的问候。
    胡主席在新宪法草案的报告中概述了越南人民争取民族独立和建立人民民主制度以及1946年第二届国会通过的越南第一部宪法的历史情况。他说，1946年宪法适合当时的情况和革命的任务。它已经完成了它的历史使命。现在，这个宪法不适合当前新的情况和新的革命任务。因此，我们要修改这个宪法。他说，新宪法草案已经经过干部和各阶层人民的研究和讨论。除了北越人民提供意见以外，修改宪法委员会还收到许多南越人民和国外越侨提供意见的来信。
    胡主席说，新宪法草案记载了越南人民几年来所获得的胜利，并提出了新的历史时期的革命任务。他说，这个宪法将进一步发挥越南人民爱祖国、爱社会主义的热情，动员人民更紧密地团结，更努力地开展竞赛，以建设和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南。
    胡主席在阐述新宪法的主要内容时，首先谈到越南民主共和国国家机构的性质。他说，新宪法草案的序言里规定：“我国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家”。他说，为了建设社会主义和实现祖国统一，我们必须不断地加强工人阶级对人民民主政权的领导。工农联盟是越南民主共和国国家机构的基础。
    胡主席说，越南是一个统一的多民族的国家，在越南国土上生活的各个民族在权利和义务上一律平等。
    胡志明主席谈到越南北方过渡到社会主义的总路线时说，新宪法草案第九条规定我国过渡到社会主义的总路线是：对国民经济进行社会主义改造和发展，使越南民主共和国从人民民主制度走上社会主义道路，把落后的经济变为具有现代化工农业和先进科学技术的社会主义经济。越南民主共和国的经济政策是不断发展生产，以不断提高人民的物质和文化生活。
    他说，我们的制度的目的是取消非社会主义的私有制，依靠全民和集体所有制使多种成分的经济变为单一的经济。国营经济是全民所有制，它领导着国民经济，政权必须保障它的优先发展。
    谈到越南民主共和国的国家组织机构时，胡主席说，为了良好地实现革命任务，我国政府必须发展全民的民主和政治生活权利，以发挥人民的积极性和创造性，使每个越南公民切实地参加管理国家的工作，大力为社会主义建设和为实现国家的统一而斗争。
    胡主席说，新宪法草案规定，越南民主共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民通过自己选出的、并且向人民负责的国会和各级人民议会行使自己的权力。
    胡主席说，新宪法草案还规定，政府所有各机关的任务是依靠人民，密切联系人民，听取人民的意见和受人民的监督。
    胡主席谈到公民的基本权利和义务时指出，新宪法草案所作的规定，表明我们的制度真正具有民主的性质。
    胡主席结束了他的报告以后，建议这次国会会议在通过新宪法以后，允许政府在明年1月1日公布新宪法。
  胡主席的报告不断被全场热烈的掌声所打断。
