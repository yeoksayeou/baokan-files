What is the Winter Fishing Season

The winter fishing season is a major fishing season in China's marine fisheries production. According to historical data, winter fishing production ranks second only to the spring fishing season nationwide, and in the Southeast Sea, it is even larger than the spring fishing season. Therefore, the winter fishing season can be said to be the golden season for fisheries in the southern coastal areas. The main catches during the winter fishing season are hairtail, small yellow croaker, flounder, snapper, crab, etc. in the offshore areas, and Acetes chinensis near the coast, with hairtail accounting for the largest proportion of the catch.

Hairtail is a warm-water fish species. After the climate in the north gradually cools in winter, hairtail migrate in groups from the Bohai Sea and northern Yellow Sea southward, and from the Yangtze River estuary in the East China Sea through Zhejiang to Fujian. Other fish species also migrate from north to south or from shallow to deep sea. Therefore, the characteristic of the winter fishing season is generally the catching of "seasonal migratory fish," which is completely different from the spring fishing season's catching of "spawning ground fish." Zhejiang's famous winter hairtail fishing season features dense fishing boats and concentrated fishing grounds, starting from mid-November each year and ending in mid-February of the following year, with the peak season in December. In the northern Yellow Sea, there are also many trawlers conducting a period of winter fishing production, but the scale is much smaller than in the south.

    什么是冬季渔汛
    冬汛是我国海洋渔业生产的一个大渔汛。根据历史情况，从全国范围来讲，冬汛生产仅次于春汛，在东南海还要大于春汛。因此，冬汛可以说是南方沿海渔业的黄金季节。冬汛的捕捞对象，外海以带鱼、小黄鱼、比目鱼、鲷类、蟹等为主，近岸以毛虾为主，其中以带鱼的产量比重为最大。
    带鱼是一种温水性鱼类。冬季北方气候渐冷以后，带鱼就由渤海、黄海北部成群向南移动，东海由长江口外经浙江向福建移动。其他鱼类也是自北向南洄游或自浅海向深海洄游。因此，冬汛的特点一般是捕“季节洄游鱼类”，这和春汛的捕“产卵场鱼类”完全不同。全国有名的浙江冬季带鱼汛，渔船密集、渔场集中，从每年的十一月中旬开始到第二年二月中旬结束，最旺汛为十二月。北方黄海北部也有不少拖网进行一个时期的冬汛生产，不过规模要比南方小得多。
