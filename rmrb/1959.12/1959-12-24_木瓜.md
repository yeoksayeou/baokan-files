　　Papaya

　　Papaya is a perennial evergreen plant of the melon tree family. It can be planted sporadically in the fields, around houses, along roadsides and riverbanks in the South, or it can be planted in patches.

　　Papaya trees bear fruit all year round, and can be harvested in successive batches. The fruit is juicy and sweet, making it an excellent succulent feed for farrowing sows. Each tree can produce two to four hundred catties of fruit per year.

　　Methods used by the masses to use papaya as pig feed: generally, the fruit is chopped, shredded and fed raw, or chopped, shredded and mixed with other feeds and cooked before feeding. (Attached picture)
