This newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, December 19th: The large-scale winter fishing season has begun in the nationally renowned Zhoushan fishing grounds of Zhejiang. Over ten thousand fishermen, aboard thousands of fishing boats, are braving the waves on the East China Sea to hunt hairtail. Zhoushan County has already caught more than 55,000 dan of fish, a 46.7% increase compared to the same period last year, achieving initial success.

Winter hairtail production is the largest marine fishing season in Zhejiang Province. The fishing grounds are widely distributed, extending from Shengshan and Huawu in the north to Dachen and Dongtou fishing grounds in the south, covering all coastal areas of the province. The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and the Party committees at all levels in the fishing areas have attached great importance to this year's winter fishing production, with early, tight, and practical preparations.

Inspired by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, through the anti-rightist struggle and the promotion of greater efforts, and the extensive and in-depth development of the socialist education movement, the enthusiasm of the fishermen has soared to unprecedented heights. During the winter production, various fishing communes launched a wave of learning from the Ant Commune, which has the highest level of marine fishing production, striving to increase fish production for the country during this fishing season. Each commune here is determined to work hard throughout the winter to overfulfill the production plan, while accelerating the realization of motorization of fishing vessels and gradually moving towards mechanization and electrification. Fishermen in Zhoushan, Ningbo, and other regions have held winter fishing departure rallies, setting sail more than ten days earlier than in previous years. The number of units involved in production has increased by 39% compared to last year, with over ten thousand more fishermen participating, making the scale unprecedented.

In the year since the people's commune movement, the public accumulation of various communes in the fishing areas has greatly increased, laying a favorable foundation for the realization of motorized fishing vessels. This year, the number of newly built motorized fishing vessels put into production in the province has increased more than threefold compared to last year. The Ant Commune has already used motorized fishing boats for all fishing activities during the winter fishing season.

Vigorously promoting the operation of large trawl nets is a groundbreaking innovation in tool reform during this year's winter fishing season. Zhoushan County recently held a large trawl net performance in Shengshan fishing grounds, widely exchanging operating techniques. Because large trawl net operations can catch fish schools in the seabed layer and can fish in deeper waters, they open up a larger field for marine fishing. Large trawl net operations can be used not only on motorized fishing boats, but also on large and small wooden sailing boats. In two days, fourteen pairs of motorized fishing boats in the Zhanmao Commune produced an average of 36 dan of fish per pair using large trawl nets, with the highest yield reaching 50 dan. More than 1,400 large trawl nets are being promoted throughout Zhejiang Province this winter, and Zhoushan County alone has already put more than 600 large trawl nets into production. Vigorously promoting the operation of large trawl nets will greatly increase the amount of fish caught.

The supply of materials for this year's winter fishing season has increased many times over compared to previous years. Various service units have added a large number of supply points in major ports, providing supplies day and night. The meteorological department has particularly strengthened weather forecasts during the fishing season, establishing a meteorological transmission service network. Special districts and counties have established meteorological stations and groups, and communes have established meteorological outposts. The Provincial Marine Research Institute has specially prepared fishing forecast reports for the fishing season, enabling fishing boats to promptly and accurately pursue large schools of fish. Supply and marketing departments have also vigorously prepared for purchasing work, ensuring that "purchases are made wherever production takes place."

This newspaper's Fuzhou dispatch, December 19th: The broad masses of fishermen in Fujian Province, with soaring enthusiasm, have launched a vigorous and thriving winter fishing production upsurge. In November, the production of various aquatic products increased by 67% compared to October. Counties such as Pingtan, Changle, Fuqing, Putian, Dongshan, and Yunxiao have overfulfilled their annual aquatic product plans one month ahead of schedule.

    乘风破浪　追捕带鱼
    浙江福建冬汛生产规模超过往年
    本报杭州19日电　全国著名的浙江舟山渔场，大规模的冬季渔汛生产已经开始。十万多渔民驾着成千上万艘渔船，乘风破浪在东海海面上追捕带鱼。舟山县已捕鱼五万五千多担，比去年同期增长46.7％，获得了初步成就。
    冬季带鱼生产是浙江省海洋捕捞规模最大的一个渔汛。渔场分布很广。北自嵊山、花乌，南至大陈、洞头渔场，遍及全省沿海各地。浙江省委和渔区各级党委，对今年的冬汛生产十分重视，准备工作抓得早、抓得紧、抓得实。
    在党的八届八中全会的鼓舞下，通过反右倾、鼓干劲，广泛深入的开展社会主义教育运动，广大渔民干劲空前高涨。各渔业公社在冬季生产中，掀起了向海洋捕捞生产水平最高的蚂蚁公社学习的热潮，争取在这个渔汛里，为国家增产更多的鱼。这里的各个公社都决心苦干一冬，超额完成生产计划，同时加速实现渔业的机帆化，并逐步向机械化、电气化的方向前进。舟山、宁波等地区的广大渔民，都纷纷举行冬汛出洋誓师大会，出海时间比往年提早十多天，投入生产的单位比去年增加39％，渔民增加一万多人，规模之大，空前未有。
    人民公社化运动一年来，渔区各公社的公共积累有很大的增长，为实现渔业机帆化打下有利基础。今年，全省投入生产的新建的机帆船比去年增加三倍多。蚂蚁公社在冬汛生产中，已全部用机帆船捕鱼。
    大力推广大拖风网作业，是今年冬汛生产上工具改革中的一个创举。舟山县最近在嵊山渔场举行大拖风网会演，广泛交流操作技术。由于大拖风网作业能捕到海底层的鱼群，可以在更深的海域里捕鱼，给海洋捕捞开辟了更大的领域。大拖风网作业不仅在机帆船可以使用，大、小型木帆船也可以使用。展茅公社在两天时间内十四对机帆船用大拖风网生产，平均每对产鱼三十六担，最高产五十担。浙江全省今冬推广大拖风网一千四百多顶，舟山县已投入生产的大拖风渔网就有六百多顶。大力推广大拖风网作业，将大大提高捕鱼量。
    今年冬汛的物资供应，比往年成倍的增多，各服务单位都在主要港口增设大批供应点，日夜供应。气象部门特别加强汛期的气象预报，建立气象传递服务网。专署、县成立气象站、组，公社成立气象哨，省海洋研究所特别做好汛期的渔发预报，使渔船可以及时正确的追捕到大鱼群。供销部门也大力做好收购准备工作，做到“生产到哪里，收购到哪里”。
    本报福州19日电　福建省广大渔民以冲天的干劲，掀起了轰轰烈烈的冬汛生产高潮，11月份各种水产的生产量比10月份增产67％，平潭、长乐、福清、莆田、东山和云霄等县，已提前一个月超额完成全年水产计划。
