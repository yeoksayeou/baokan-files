　　"Snow Sea Silver Mountain" is a new feature film produced by Xi'an Film Studio. The film reflects the story of Zhang Xiufang, a cotton-growing expert in the Guanzhong Plain area of Shaanxi Province, who selflessly helps her rival, Li Chunlan, in production, enabling Chunlan's cotton yield to surpass her own. They establish a deep friendship in the course of their joint labor for the construction of a beautiful socialist future. The film showcases the new relationship between people in the new society, the lofty communist style of selfless devotion, and displays the spirited and leaping-forward spirit of liberated working women.
    Striking the Aggressors
    The Polish film "Answer to Atrocities" depicts the German invaders retreating step by step under the heroic counterattack of the Soviet Red Army in 1943. Under the leadership of the Party, the Polish people tenaciously launched an anti-fascist underground struggle. A Polish patriotic youth organization led by Xiao Hei, a young and courageous man loyal to the motherland, accepted the task of executing the German commander to avenge the martyrs. This group of young and experienced patriots carried out decisive, meticulous, and thorough combat decisions and preparations, and finally, at the predetermined time and place, cleverly killed the German commander and eliminated the enemy. The film fully demonstrates the Polish youth's love for the Party, lofty patriotism, and revolutionary optimism.
    Lofty Duty
