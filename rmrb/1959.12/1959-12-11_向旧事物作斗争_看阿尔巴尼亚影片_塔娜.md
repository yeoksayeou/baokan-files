    Struggling Against Old Things
    —Watching the Albanian Film "Tana"
    Yu Dao
    The film "Tana," adapted from the novel of the same name by Albanian writer Fatmir Gjata, is the first feature film made in Albania. The film shows the great achievements made in agriculture in Albania under the leadership of the Labor Party since liberation, as well as the growth of a new generation. We see that the hardworking people who are building socialism are not only transforming nature and society, but also changing their own ideological and living habits; they abandon the backward, decadent, and doomed things of the past, while constantly and resolutely fighting against the remnants of old ideas in people's minds.
    Tana, the female production team leader and production expert in the agricultural production cooperative, is a vibrant and advanced young woman cultivated by the new era. She loves labor, loves the cooperative, and loves the new life principles brought by liberation to the people. Scefan, a simple and brave young man from a neighboring village, loves her and asks to marry her. Tana agreed to him, but on one condition: Scefan must move to her village to live, because the mountain village where he lives is still in the stage of individual farming. She loves Scefan, but she cannot leave the collective of the cooperative. Here, Tana's position is firm. She persuades her lover to abandon the feudal idea of "matrilocal marriage," and asks him to persuade his mother to move here with him and apply to join the cooperative.
    Scefan agreed, but his grandfather opposed her marrying someone from another village; and Scefan's application to join the cooperative was illegally rejected by the cooperative management committee under the manipulation of the cooperative director, Rigor. The cooperative director wanted to arrange Tana's marriage, believing that she should not marry someone from another village who did not bring land with him. He threatened to expel Tana if she didn't marry Lefter, whom she didn't love.
    Tana's will is firm; she did not compromise with the threat, and she asked the district committee secretary for help. The district committee secretary encouraged her to fight resolutely: "This matter depends more on yourself; you must be brave and strong. Old habits must be destroyed." At this time, Tana's grandfather realized that Rigor was using his stubbornness to carry out despicable activities, and he agreed to Tana's marriage. Skander, the village party branch secretary, also supported her and severely criticized Rigor: "You are really like an individual farmer, Rigor. The Party did not teach us this way. Didn't you and I also fight for this in the past? Should we educate everyone like this? You must know that we have only one goal, which is the happiness of the people." Young people supported her, and the path Tana was taking was also a brand-new and correct path they wanted to take. The masses supported her, and the cooperative members' congress approved Scefan's joining the cooperative. After Scefan was injured by the despicable Lefter, the masses lit bonfires outside the hospital waiting for news of his recovery. This shows that rural collectivist thought has overcome backward feudal thought and capitalist thought, and it has also educated people like Rigor.
    It is precisely because of the tens of thousands of Albanian young men and women like Tana that today, with unparalleled perseverance and enthusiasm, they are building a new socialist life, and there is no force that can stop them.
    It is particularly worth mentioning that Tana's grandfather is a very lovable character, both in the novel and in the film. He originally opposed his granddaughter marrying someone from another village, but later, after figuring out the real intentions of Rigor and others, he said to him angrily: "I have never hit her, but you deserve to be beaten severely, so that you will never forget it." He lived to be over a hundred years old, and even a few days before his death, he still tried to personally transport tree saplings from a neighboring village to plant apple trees that had never been grown locally, to benefit the next generation. This incident itself demonstrates the old man's high communist style.
    In this film, we are delighted to see that the Albanian people have made arduous labor to create a better life and rapidly changed the face of their motherland. There is laughter, pain, and struggle, but victory belongs to the thousands of ordinary laborers like Tana who work hard to build socialism!

    向旧事物作斗争
    ——看阿尔巴尼亚影片“塔娜”
    于道
    根据阿尔巴尼亚作家法特米尔·吉亚泰的同名小说改编的电影“塔娜”，是阿尔巴尼亚拍摄的第一部故事片。影片表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民解放以来在劳动党领导下农业方面取得的巨大成就，以及新的一代的成长。我们看到，正在建设社会主义的勤劳的人民，不但在改造着自然，改造着社会，也在改变着自己的思想和生活面貌；他们唾弃了过去那些落后的、腐朽的、注定要灭亡的事物，同时不断地跟人们头脑中旧思想意识残余进行坚决的斗争。
    塔娜，这个农业生产合作社里的妇女生产队长，生产能手，是新时代培养出来的朝气蓬勃的先进青年，她热爱劳动，热爱合作社，热爱解放给人民带来的新的生活原则。邻村纯朴勇敢的青年斯切方热爱着她，要求和她结婚。塔娜答应了他，但有一个条件，斯切方必须搬到她们村子里来住。因为他住的山村还是处于单干阶段。她爱斯切方，可她离不开合作社这个集体。在这里，塔娜的立场是坚定的。她说服爱人抛弃那“入赘”的封建想法，要他说服母亲一道搬到这里来，申请入社。
    斯切方同意了，可是她爷爷反对她和外村人结婚；而斯切方的入社申请又在社长里高尔的操纵下，被社管理委员会不合法地否决了。社长要包办塔娜的婚姻，认为她不应该嫁给没有带来土地的外村人。用开除塔娜来威胁她嫁给自己不爱的烈夫泰尔。
    塔娜的意志是坚定的，她没有向威胁妥协，她请求区委书记的帮助。区委书记鼓励她坚决进行斗争：“这事要多靠你自己，一定要勇敢、坚强。旧的习惯必须要摧毁。”这时塔娜的爷爷认清了里高尔是利用他的固执进行了卑鄙的活动，他同意塔娜的婚事。村党支部书记斯坎德尔也支持她，并且严厉地批评了里高尔：“你真像一个单干户，里高尔，党可不是这样教导我们的，我和你过去不也是为了这个而斗争，难道应该这样来教育大家？要知道我们只有一个目标，就是人民的幸福。”青年人支持她，塔娜所走的也是他们要走的一条崭新的、正确的道路。群众支持她，社员大会批准了斯切方入社。当斯切方被卑鄙的烈夫泰尔打伤后，群众烧起篝火在医院门外等待他脱险的消息。这里表现了农村集体主义思想战胜了落后的封建思想和资本主义思想，也教育了像里高尔这样的人。
    正是像塔娜这样成千上万的阿尔巴尼亚青年男女，今天以无比的毅力和热情在建设着社会主义的新生活，再也没有什么力量可以阻碍他们。
    特别值得一提的是塔娜的爷爷，不论在小说中或是影片中都是刻划得非常可爱的一个人物。他本来也反对孙女儿嫁给外村人，但后来弄清了里高尔等的真正意图，就忿忿地对他说：“我从来没打过她，可你，倒该狠狠地打一顿，让你永远忘不了。”他活了一百多岁，直到临死前几天，还设法亲自去邻村搬运了树秧回来，要在本地栽上从来没有种过的苹果树，为下一代造福，这件事本身就表现了老人的高度的共产主义风格。
    在这部影片里，我们欣喜地看到阿尔巴尼亚人民为了创造美好的生活，付出了艰巨的劳动，迅速地改变了祖国的面貌。这里面有欢笑，有苦痛，也有斗争，但胜利是属于像塔娜这样千千万万为建设社会主义而辛勤劳动的普通劳动者的！
