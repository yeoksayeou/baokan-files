This newspaper reports: Hubei Province has a total of more than 1.27 million new, expanded, and continuing large, medium, and small water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, with an estimated 1.5 billion cubic meters of earth and stone to be completed, a very large engineering task. Thanks to vigorous tool reform, the average overall efficiency of the province has more than doubled compared to last year, and many projects are likely to be completed one to two months ahead of schedule.

The spirit of continuous revolution, constantly reforming and upgrading various tools, is a new feature of Hubei Province's vigorous water conservancy tool reform this year. Paoma Township (now Paoma Commune) in Dangyang County, famous for eliminating shoulder carrying by vigorously promoting wheelbarrows in the winter water conservancy efforts of 1957, is not satisfied with the original "wheelbarrow" level this year in the midst of large-scale water conservancy construction. They are vigorously promoting iron and wooden rail dump trucks for earth transport on flat ground, and using slides and skids for earth transport on slopes. They have also adopted tools such as road rollers and pile drivers, so that the average efficiency of each water conservancy site in the commune is more than double that of the winter of 1957. After realizing wheelbarrow transportation of earth this year, Zhoushan Commune in Hanyang County proposed the slogan "Further reform tools, double efficiency again," and successively created tools such as powered grass belt earth conveyors and animal-powered earth conveyors to replace the original handcarts, increasing efficiency by ten to dozens of times.

The industries run by the people's communes have played a huge role in tool reform. During the vigorous tool reform movement at the Yanbaokeng Reservoir in Hong'an County, the iron and wood factories run by the commune were moved to the construction site, solving the difficulty of insufficient technical personnel. The Daanhe Reservoir construction site of the Dahe'an People's Commune in Luotian County, relying on the support of community-run industries, established 28 vehicle factories, and now the dam backfilling work has completely eliminated shoulder carrying.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: Most areas of Heilongjiang Province are promoting advanced methods such as frozen earth blasting and ice road transportation in winter water conservancy construction, and the efficiency of excavating earth and stone is generally more than 40% higher than during summer construction.

The climate in most areas of Heilongjiang Province is extremely cold every winter, and the ground surface freezes into a layer of hard soil three feet thick. It is very inefficient for one person to dig frozen soil with a pickaxe, and they cannot dig even one cubic meter per day; however, this situation is conducive to blasting and building ice roads for transporting earth with ice sleds. Therefore, some areas have further promoted the methods of frozen earth blasting and ice road transportation adopted in last winter's water conservancy construction. Due to the use of these two methods in the excavation of the Hongqi Canal in Wuchang County, the average daily earth excavation efficiency per person reached a maximum of seven cubic meters, 1.3 times higher than the efficiency of summer construction. The Xincheng Reservoir construction site in Yanshou County adopted the horizontal tunnel large blasting method, using 400 workers and two tons of explosives to blast more than 10,000 cubic meters of soil, increasing efficiency by 25 times compared to manual digging.

In order to promote frozen earth blasting and ice road earth transportation, various places have made preparations long ago. Before the autumn harvest, 48 local explosives factories were established in various places, and more than 120 were successively built after the autumn harvest. The local explosives workshops run by the people's communes are flourishing like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and the Shuangxing Commune in Wuchang County alone has 70 explosives workshops in production. Many winter construction tools have also been manufactured, and various places plan to manufacture approximately 280,000 pieces of various types of earth-transporting ice sleds, frozen soil splitting devices, and other tools.

### 不断改革工具提高工效  湖北省水利总平均工效比去年提高一倍多  黑龙江因时制宜推广冻土爆破和冰道运输

    不断改革工具提高工效
    湖北省水利总平均工效比去年提高一倍多
    黑龙江因时制宜推广冻土爆破和冰道运输
    本报讯　湖北省今冬明春新建、扩建和续建的大、中、小水利工程共达一百二十七万多处，需要完成的土石方将达十五亿立方米，工程任务很大。由于大搞工具改革，全省总平均工效已比去年提高一倍多，许多工程都可能提前一两个月完成。
    坚持不断革命精神，使各种工具不断改革，不断升级，是今年湖北省各地大搞水利工具改革的新特点。1957年冬修水利中以大搞运土车子化消灭肩挑出名的当阳县跑马乡（现在的跑马公社），今年在大兴水利中，群众已不满足原来“车子化”水平，在平地大搞铁、木轨斗车运土，搞坡地滑丝、滑板运土，还采用了压路磙、打硪架等工具，使全公社各水利工地的平均工效比1957年冬提高一倍多。汉阳县奓山公社今年在实现运土车子化以后，又提出“工具再改革，工效再加番”的口号，先后创制了动力草带运土机、畜力运土机等工具，代替了原来的手推车，工效一下提高十几倍到几十倍不等。
    各人民公社办的工业在工具改革中发挥了巨大的作用。红安县烟宝坑水库在大搞工具改革运动中，把公社办的铁、木工厂搬到工地，解决了技术力量不足的困难。罗田县大河岸人民公社的东安河水库工地，依靠社办工业的支援，办起二十八个车子厂，现在大坝回填工作已全部消灭了肩挑。
    据新华社哈尔滨讯　黑龙江省大部地区在水利冬修中推广冻土爆破和冰道运输等先进方法，开挖土石方的工效一般比夏季施工提高40％以上。
    黑龙江省每年冬季气候酷寒，地表冻上一层三尺厚的坚硬土层，一个人用镐刨冻土，一天刨不上一立方米，工效很低；但是，这种情况却便于爆破和修建冰道，使用冰撬运土。因此，有些地区把去冬水利施工中采取的冻土爆破和浇冰道运土的办法，今冬又进一步推广。五常县开挖的红旗运河，由于采用这两种方法，平均每人每天挖土工效最高达到七立方米，比夏季施工效率提高了一点三倍。延寿县新城水库工地采用横洞式大爆破方法，用四百个工、二吨炸药，就炸土一万多立方米，比人工刨土效率提高二十五倍。
    为了推广冻土爆破和冰道运土，各地早就进行了准备。在秋收前，各地就建立了土炸药厂四十八座，秋收一结束，又陆续兴建一百二十多座。人民公社办的土炸药作坊更如雨后春笋，仅五常县双兴公社就有七十个炸药作坊正在生产炸药。制造的冬季施工工具也很多，各地计划制造各种类型的运土冰撬、劈冻土器等工具约二十八万件。
