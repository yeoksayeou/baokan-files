    "Invisible Empire" – The Ford Foundation
    Lè Shān
    An "invisible empire" is playing a significant role in U.S. cultural education, diplomacy, and military decision-making through its control of finances and ideas. It uses vast sums of money to stifle the minds and lives of American intellectuals; it creates frantic war hysteria through notorious entities like the "Gaither Committee" and its so-called "secret report;" it engages in economic intelligence activities and intensifies cultural aggression against Asia and Africa under the guise of "philanthropy" and "cultural exchange;" it conducts espionage and subversion activities abroad under the banner of "research" and the guise of "experts." This "invisible empire" is the Ford Foundation, the most powerful and well-funded among the more than seven thousand diverse foundations in the United States, and one that has been particularly rampant in its activities recently.
        Snowballing
    The Ford Motor Company, which reaped huge profits by relying on so-called "Fordism" that maximized workers' labor intensity and implemented a system of surveillance in its factories, is the second-largest American automobile trust, second only to General Motors. To expand his influence and reduce income and inheritance taxes, "Automobile King" Henry Ford established the Ford Foundation in 1936. With the establishment of the Ford Foundation, the Ford family did not have to worry about their descendants selling Ford Motor Company stock and losing control of the company. This is because 90% of the company's stock (all non-voting stock) is held by the Ford Foundation, and the foundation's executives are all confidants of the Ford family. The remaining 10% of the voting stock is mostly directly controlled by the Ford family.
    In 1949, when the Ford Foundation began its active operations, its total assets were approximately $500 million. Now, including real estate, its assets have increased to $2 billion. Under the guise of "charity," the foundation's snowball has grown larger and larger.
      Serving Foreign Expansion
    Not long ago, the American "Reporter" magazine described the Ford Foundation's influence on American culture and education. It said: "What the Ford Foundation has done in American higher education is virtually to subsidize every important university and college in the United States. The Ford Foundation's grants to these schools are ostensibly unconditional, but this window-dressing can only deceive the simple-minded. When our university presidents know that a small group of opinionated people in an office on Madison Avenue have the power to grant or withhold millions of dollars in grants, they will inevitably formulate university policies according to these people's opinions, so as not to offend the grant-givers. Today, the Ford Foundation, sitting firmly at the center of this control network, has participated in every fundamental decision made in higher education."
    Recently, the Ford Foundation has also selected some novelists, poets, artists, composers, and directors to receive grants as their working expenses. This shows that the Ford Foundation's activities have also penetrated the fields of American literature and art.
    The Ford Foundation's money is not spent in vain. Through those cultural and educational institutions and individuals that receive grants, it indoctrinates the American people with ideas of foreign aggression and recruits talent for America's aggressive policies.
    The Ford Foundation uses the method of donating funds to manipulate almost all organized foreign policy research groups in the United States, and the basic "public opinion" on American foreign affairs is constituted by these groups. The Ford Foundation gave the "Foreign Policy Association" two donations, which expanded the scope of the association's activities many times over. The Ford Foundation also "granted" a huge sum of money to the "Council on Foreign Relations," the most influential international organization in the United States. This organization frequently publishes so-called research reports on American foreign policy, clamoring that military force must be used to support American foreign policy and advocating for arms expansion and war preparation.
    The Ford Foundation, through "grants," manipulates the research work on international issues in various famous universities in the United States. The research work of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's International Studies Program, the training work of foreign financial officials at Harvard University, the research work on China and Southeast Asian countries at Cornell University, the research work on diplomacy and foreign relations at Columbia University, and the research work on Africa at Boston University and the University of Chicago all receive substantial subsidies from the Ford Foundation. The Ford Foundation has also established a one million dollar scholarship fund for the training of diplomatic officials. The Ford Foundation has established a detailed international development plan and has its own group of "diplomatic personnel."
    The Ford Foundation's influence on American military policy also comes through donations. Advanced research institutions for American defense plans, such as the Institute for Defense Analyses and the National Academy of Sciences, all receive subsidies from the Ford Foundation. The RAND Corporation, one of the defense planning research institutions, is the backer of Gaither, the former chairman of the Ford Foundation's board of trustees. The RAND Corporation also received millions of dollars in subsidies from the Ford Foundation. In 1957, a committee headed by Gaither put forward a notorious report advocating frantic war preparation. This committee represents the most aggressive forces of American monopoly groups in the oil and arms industries, and the Rockefeller, Morgan, and Mellon consortia all have their representatives on this committee. Due to the intricate connections between the various American monopoly groups and their consistency in foreign aggression and expansion, the Ford Foundation has in fact become a tool serving the common interests of the Ford, Morgan, Rockefeller, and other consortia.
  Under the Cloak of "Charity"
    On November 18, 1958, Dulles gave a speech in Cleveland, advocating that the United States use methods such as "aid" to win over newly independent countries. He said that private foreign "aid" is a good way to realize America's aggressive policy because "private philanthropy is extremely important, and it is not politically suspect." In this so-called "charity," the Ford Foundation is naturally a very important one. The Indian "Blitz" weekly said: "The leaders of this type of organization in the United States constantly emphasize that their main purpose is to cooperate with underdeveloped countries in the cultural field on a private basis. The capital of these foundations is provided by the largest monopoly organizations in the United States. The representatives of the largest monopoly organizations in the United States are the directors of these foundations. It is they who preside over the activities of the foundations.
    "In addition to the Ford brothers, the leading figures on the Ford Foundation's board of directors include McCloy, chairman of Rockefeller's Chase Manhattan Bank, and Cowles, a banker from the Morgan consortium.
    "Economic intelligence activities occupy a central position in the Ford Foundation's activities. The Ford Foundation's economic intelligence activities are carried out through its representatives sent from the United States and agents from local residents."
    Under the guise of "charity," the Ford Foundation has been engaging in wooing activities towards Asian and Middle Eastern countries through "grants," and this has been particularly rampant in recent years. In 1950, the Ford Foundation began its so-called overseas development plan in thirteen Asian and Middle Eastern countries. By the end of 1957, it had allocated $75 million. In 1958, the Ford Foundation's "grants" to some Asian and Middle Eastern countries in the name of "conducting education, economic and social development plans," and "cultural exchanges" amounted to more than $10 million. In 1959, the Ford Foundation's activities actively developed towards Africa. According to a report in the French "Le Figaro" from April 11 to 12, the Ford Foundation has decided to allocate $150,000 to be given to North African students in the form of "scholarships" or other "assistance." Its purpose is to try to spread American influence among young students in North Africa and cultivate American agents.
    The Ford Foundation's cultural aggression activities in Asia and Africa often take very cunning forms. For example, in order to expand American influence and facilitate the use of Arabic to promote the "American way of life," the Ford Foundation has allocated funds to carry out research on simplifying the Arabic alphabet. According to a report in the British "Islamic Review" in January 1959, the "Unified Arabic Alphabet Foundation," funded by the Ford Foundation, has been officially established in New York. The chairman of the association, Nasri Qatar, wrote a letter to the editor of the "Islamic Review" saying, "We plan to establish several offices in the Middle East in the future," pretending to be very concerned about the work of Arabic script reform. In fact, it is just creating an excuse to infiltrate the aggressive forces into Arab countries. At the same time, the Ford Foundation has increased a large amount of funding for the "research" work on Asian and African countries in American universities and research institutions. The University of Chicago, Yale University, and others have recently received "grants" from the Ford Foundation. This is all the more sufficient to show that the Ford Foundation's activities in Asia and Africa are "not really about the wine itself."
    Spies Wearing "Expert" Masks
    As of 1958, India, Pakistan, Burma, and other Southeast Asian countries, as well as Middle Eastern countries, were the targets of the Ford Foundation's activities. After 1958, the Ford Foundation also included the African region in its main scope of activities. In addition to collecting economic intelligence and creating favorable conditions for the penetration of American monopoly capital in these regions, the Ford Foundation also engages in espionage activities.
    According to materials revealed by the Indian "Blitz" weekly on November 2, 1957, the rebel group in Indonesia maintained contact with the Ford Foundation. An organization called the "Padang Committee" once obtained approximately $2 million in funding from the Ford Foundation. The "experts" and "scientists" sent by the Ford Foundation to teach at the University of Ceylon in Colombo are also doing unspeakable things. A person named Everton, formerly the Ford Foundation's representative in Burma, was later specifically responsible for coordinating the intelligence work of the Ford Foundation and the American Central Intelligence Agency. Everton is a veteran spy. From 1944 to 1945, he was active in India, serving as a representative of the American military intelligence agency. In Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand, there is an American spy training center, and its leader, Brown, is the former assistant executive director of the Ford Foundation. Another person specifically responsible for guiding the Ford Foundation's training work, Mitchell, is nominally the foundation's Buddhist cultural advisor, but in reality, he is a member of the Central Intelligence Agency. In 1956, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel due to the Ford Foundation's recommendation.
    The Ford Foundation's anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities are even more blatant. As early as 1951, the Ford Foundation allocated funds to establish a "Free Russia Fund," which was later reorganized into the "East European Fund." From 1951 to 1954, this fund received a huge sum of $4 billion to support reactionary exile groups and traitors in anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities, and to carry out subversive conspiracies in Eastern European countries. The Ford Foundation also allocated $70,000 to support some of the most reactionary and anti-communist socialist and labor groups in various countries.
    At the end of 1958, the Ford Foundation funded the establishment of the so-called "Strategic Studies Institute" in London. This institute is ostensibly "a clearinghouse to help leaders, policymakers and commentators in the Atlantic region better understand the impact of modern weapons on international relations," but its real mission is to "gather and disseminate intelligence."
    The "Invisible Empire" – the Ford Foundation, with its financial resources, constrains thought and influences policies domestically, possessing great authority; abroad, it acts as the vanguard of American imperialist political, economic, and cultural aggression. This shows that this organization is an important tool for the foreign expansion of the American monopoly capitalist group.

    “无形帝国”——福特基金会
    乐山
    一个“无形帝国”，正通过它的财政和思想的控制，在美国文化教育、外交、军事等决策方面起着重要的作用。它用大量的金钱，窒息了美国知识分子的思想和生活；它通过像臭名远扬的“盖瑟委员会”及其所谓“秘密报告”的方式，制造疯狂的战争歇斯底里；它在“慈善事业”和“文化交流”的名义下，从事经济情报活动并加紧对亚非地区的文化侵略；它打着“研究”的招牌、披着“专家”的外衣，在国外进行间谍颠覆活动。这个“无形帝国”，就是在美国七千多个形形色色的基金会中势力最强大、基金最雄厚、近来活动最猖狂的福特基金会。
        雪球愈滚愈大
    依靠尽量提高工人劳动强度的所谓“福特主义”和在工厂里实行特务统治而取得巨额利润的福特汽车公司，是仅次于通用汽车公司而居第二位的美国汽车托辣斯。“汽车大王”亨利·福特为了扩大自己的影响，少交所得税和遗产税，于1936年设立了福特基金会。由于福特基金会的成立，福特家族用不着耽心他们的后裔卖掉福特汽车公司的股票，失去对福特汽车公司的控制权。因为这个公司90％的股票（全是没有投票权的股票）都归于福特基金会，而基金会的负责人物都是福特家族的亲信。其余10％有投票权的股票，绝大部分直接控制在福特家族的手中。
    1949年，当福特基金会开始积极活动的时候，它的财产总共约为五亿美元。现在，连同不动产，它的资产增至二十亿美元之巨。在“慈善”的幌子下，基金会的雪球愈滚愈大。
      为对外扩张服务
    不久以前，美国“信使”杂志描绘了福特基金会对美国文化教育的影响。它说：“福特基金会在美国高等教育界所做的事，实际上是几乎使美国每一个重要的大学和学院都受它的津贴。福特基金会给这些学校的赠款，表面上是不附带条件的，但是这种装装门面的作法，只能欺骗头脑简单的人。当我们的大学校长们知道，在麦迪逊大街上的一个办公室中的一小撮固执己见的人有权给或不给数达几百万美元的赠款的时候，他们就会不可避免地按这些人的意见制定大学的政策，以免得罪赠款者。今天，稳坐在这操纵网中央的福特基金会，已经参预了高等教育界所作出的每一个根本性的决定。”
    最近，福特基金会还选择了一些小说家、诗人、艺术家、作曲家、导演来接受它的赠款，作为他们的工作费用。这说明，福特基金会的活动也打进了美国的文学艺术领域。
    福特基金会的这些钱不是白花的。它通过那些接受赠款的文化教育机关和个人，向美国人民灌输对外侵略的思想，为美国的侵略政策网罗人才。
    福特基金会用捐助经费的方法，使美国几乎所有的有组织的外交政策研究团体，都受它的操纵，而美国对外事务的基本“舆论”，就是由这些团体构成的。福特基金会给了“外交政策协会”两次捐款，就使这个协会的活动范围扩大了许多倍。福特基金会也曾以巨额款项“赠予”美国最有影响的国际机构“外交学会”。这个机构经常发表所谓美国外交政策的研究报告，叫嚷必须用军事力量来支持美国的外交政策，鼓吹扩军备战。
    福特基金会通过“赠款”的方式，操纵了美国各著名大学中有关国际问题的研究工作。马萨诸塞理工学院国际问题研究所的研究工作、哈佛大学外国财政官员的训练工作、康奈尔大学关于中国和东南亚国家的研究工作、哥伦比亚大学关于外交及对外关系的研究工作、波士顿大学和芝加哥大学关于非洲的研究工作，都接受福特基金会的大量津贴。福特基金会还为外交官员训练设立了一个一百万美元的奖学金基金。福特基金会确立了一个详尽的国际发展计划，拥有自己的一批“外交人员”。
    福特基金会对美国军事政策的影响，也是从捐款的途径来进行的。美国的国防计划高级研究机关如防御分析研究所、全国科学院等等，都领受福特基金会的津贴。国防计划研究机构之一的兰德公司，就是福特基金会理事会前届主席盖瑟的后台老板。兰德公司也从福特基金会领到了几百万美元的津贴。1957年，以盖瑟为首的委员会提出了一个臭名昭著的鼓吹疯狂备战的报告。这个委员会代表着美国垄断集团中最富有侵略性的石油和军火企业的势力，洛克菲勒、摩根、梅隆等财团在这个委员会中都有它们的代表。由于美国各个垄断集团之间千丝万缕的联系和它们对外侵略扩张的一致性，福特基金会事实上已经成为福特、摩根、洛克菲勒等财团的共同利益服务的工具。
  在“慈善事业”的外衣下
    1958年11月18日，杜勒斯在克利夫兰发表演说，鼓吹美国通过“援助”等方法来拉拢新近获得独立的国家。他说，私人的对外“援助”是实现美国侵略政策的好办法，因为“私立的慈善事业是极为重要的，它在政治上不受人怀疑。”在这种所谓“慈善事业”中，福特基金会自然是很重要的一个。印度“闪电”周刊说：“美国的这一类团体的领袖们不断地强调说，他们的主要目的是在私人的基础上，与不发达的国家在文化的领域中进行合作。这些基金会的资本是由美国最大的垄断组织提供的。美国最大的垄断组织的代表就是这些基金会的董事。主持基金会的活动的正是他们。
    “在福特基金会董事会中占领导地位的，除了福特兄弟以外，还有洛克菲勒的大通曼哈顿银行的董事长麦克洛埃和摩根财团的银行家考尔斯。
    “经济情报活动在福特基金会活动中占有中心的地位。福特基金会的经济情报活动，是通过它从美国派来的代表和本地居民中的代理人来进行的。”
    福特基金会在“慈善事业”的幌子下，通过“赠款”方式向亚洲和中近东国家进行拉拢活动，最近几年以来特别猖獗。1950年，福特基金会在十三个亚洲和中近东国家开始了所谓海外发展计划。截至1957年年底为止，已经拨出七千五百万美元。1958年，福特基金会在“进行教育、经济和社会发展计划”、“文化交流”的名义下，对亚洲和中近东一些国家的“赠款”达一千万美元以上。1959年，福特基金会的活动积极向非洲发展，据法国“费加罗报”4月11日至12日报道：福特基金会已决定拨款十五万美元，以“奖学金”或其他“援助”形式赠送给北非学生。它的目的是企图在北非青年学生中散布美国的影响，培植美国的代理人。
    福特基金会对亚非地区进行的文化侵略活动，常常采取十分狡黠的方式。例如，为了扩大美国的影响，便于利用阿拉伯文宣传“美国生活方式”，福特基金会拨款进行简化阿拉伯文字母的研究工作。据1959年1月英国“伊斯兰评论”报道，福特基金会出资创办的“统一阿拉伯文字母基金会”，已经在纽约正式宣告成立。该会主席纳斯里·卡塔尔写信给“伊斯兰评论”的编者说，“我们计划以后在中东设立几个办事处”，装做很关心阿拉伯文字改革工作的样子。事实上只是制造借口，以便把侵略势力打进阿拉伯国家。与此同时，福特基金会对美国国内大学及研究机关关于亚非国家的“研究”工作，增加了大量拨款。芝加哥大学、耶鲁大学等最近都收到福特基金会的“赠款”。这就更足以说明福特基金会在亚非地区活动是“醉翁之意不在酒”的。
    戴着“专家”面具的间谍
    截至1958年为止，印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸和其它东南亚国家以及中近东国家，都是福特基金会进行活动的对象。1958年以后，福特基金会又把非洲地区包括在它的主要活动范围内。福特基金会除了收集经济情报，为美国垄断资本在这些地区的渗入创造有利的条件以外，还进行间谍活动。
    据印度“闪电”周刊1957年11月2日揭露的材料，印度尼西亚的叛乱集团，就同福特基金会保持着联系。有一个名叫“巴东委员会”的组织，曾经从福特基金会取得约二百万美元的经费。福特基金会派往科伦坡锡兰大学任教的“专家”、“科学家”，也干着不可告人的勾当。一个名叫艾弗顿的人，从前是福特基金会驻缅甸的代表，后来专门负责协调福特基金会与美国中央情报局的情报工作。艾弗顿是一个老牌特务。1944—1945年，他曾在印度活动，充当美国军事情报机关的代表。在泰国的乌蓬·拉贾他尼省，有一个美国特务训练中心，它的领导人布朗，是福特基金会的前任助理执行理事。另有一个专门负责指导福特基金会训练工作的密契尔，名义上是基金会的佛教文化顾问，实际上是中央情报局的人员。1956年，他由于福特基金会的保举，被提升为陆军中校。
    福特基金会的反苏反共活动更是极端露骨。早在1951年，福特基金会就拨款设立了一个“自由俄国基金”，以后改组为“东欧基金”。从1951年到1954年，这项基金获得四十亿美元的巨款，来支持反动的流亡团体、叛国分子从事反苏反共活动，并在东欧国家进行颠覆阴谋。福特基金会还拨出七万美元，支持各国的一些最反动的、反共最力的社会党和劳工团体。
    1958年年底，福特基金会出资在伦敦设立所谓“战略研究所”。这个研究所表面上是“作为一个交换站，协助大西洋地区的领袖、政策制订人和时事评论家更了解现代武器对国际关系的影响”，但是它的真正任务是“收集和散发情报”。
    “无形帝国”——福特基金会，凭借它的财力，在国内箝制思想、左右政策，具有很大的权威；在国外充当了美帝国主义政治、经济、文化侵略的急先锋。这说明这个组织是美国垄断资本集团对外扩张的重要工具。
