　　Seizing a Flying Start

　　In the past, our basic construction unit had a prominent situation of being "relaxed at the beginning of the year and tight at the end," and some people said that it was not good to work in the cold weather. Therefore, every December, production dropped significantly, and in the first quarter, little or nothing was done. However, after studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and inspired by the call to oppose right-leaning tendencies and exert great effort, our production in December this year not only did not decline, but also increased a lot compared with November. Our team completed the entire month's production task ahead of schedule on December 14. It can be seen that the decline in production due to cold weather is a completely changeable human phenomenon, and not some kind of "routine."

　　1960 is coming, and we are responding to the Party's call to make all preparations to welcome a flying start in the new year. To strive for a flying start and monthly red production success, in addition to adhering to putting politics in command and doing a good job in preparing materials and technology, we believe that vigorously carrying out technical innovation is a very important link. Judging from our team's situation, in 1958, our production mainly relied on manual labor, and mechanical production only accounted for 40%. The whole year only completed more than 2,900 tons of steel reinforcement tasks, which could not meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward. This year, the tasks assigned to us by the state are much more than last year, and the manpower has been reduced from 230 to 96. However, because we vigorously engaged in mechanization and used machines to replace manual labor, we greatly improved labor productivity. So far, our team's mechanization and semi-mechanization level has reached 96%, and we have completed the annual workload seventy days ahead of schedule. For a flying start next year, we have established an innovation group to further improve the process and make production efficiency greater. A flying start and monthly red production success in the first quarter of next year can be completely seized.

　　巧夺开门红
    我们基本建设单位，过去“年初松年末紧”的情况比较突出，有人说天冷不好干活。因此，每到12月份生产就显著往下降，第一季度很少或者压根儿不干什么活。可是，学习党的八届八中全会文件后，在反右倾鼓干劲号召的鼓舞下，今年12月份生产不仅没有下降，还比11月份增长很多。我们队在12月14日提前完成了全月生产任务。可见，天冷生产下降，这是完全可以改变的人为的现象，而不是什么“常规”。
    1960年就要到了，我们正在响应党的号召，作好一切准备工作，迎接明年开门红。要争得开门红、月月红，除了坚持政治挂帅，做好材料、技术等方面的准备工作外，我们认为大搞技术革新是很重要的一环。从我们队的情况看，1958年我们生产主要靠手工劳动，机械生产只占40％，全年只完成钢筋任务两千九百多吨，不能满足大跃进的需要。今年国家给我们的任务比去年多得多，人力从二百三十人减到九十六人。但是因为我们大闹机械化，用机器代替人工劳动，大大提高了劳动生产率。到目前为止我们全队机械化半机械化水平已达到96％，提前七十天完成了全年工作量。为了明年开门红，我们已成立了革新组，进一步改进工艺过程，使生产效率更大的提高，明年第一季度的开门红、月月红是完全可以夺到的。
