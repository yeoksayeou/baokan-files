Chengdu Institute of Technology Combines Teaching with Production

    This newspaper reports that the Chengdu Institute of Technology closely integrates teaching and production labor, systematically organizing students to participate in scientific research. This helps students further master theoretical knowledge and production skills, cultivates independent work abilities, and significantly improves teaching quality, leading to an unprecedented leap forward in scientific research work.

    Since the beginning of this year, over 1,100 teachers and students at the Chengdu Institute of Technology have participated in scientific research. By the end of November, the institute had completed 132 research tasks, accounting for 86% of the annual plan. This is more than forty items more than the total number of research projects completed in the seven years before 1958. Among them, forty-seven research results have been submitted to production units for research and application.

    In organizing students to participate in scientific research, the Chengdu Institute of Technology has implemented the principle of combining teaching needs with practical production, incorporating scientific research into the educational plan and making unified and appropriate arrangements for teaching, labor, and scientific research. In terms of the content of scientific research, each department closely integrates with the teaching process, arranging different aspects and natures of tasks according to the learning content of students of different majors and grades at each stage. These tasks include: preparing new experiments, conducting special research related to teaching, designing and trial-producing new products, researching new technologies, summarizing production experience, and conducting theoretical research. This not only completes certain research tasks but also improves students' knowledge levels, providing them with more comprehensive training.

    The specific arrangements for students to participate in scientific research at the Chengdu Institute of Technology mainly include combining with teaching and combining with production labor. In linking with teaching, they adopt the following methods according to the principle of adapting to teaching requirements: First, combining some experimental courses with scientific research work to conduct special experimental research. Second, combining course assignments and course design to carry out design and calculation parts of relevant scientific research topics. Third, in teaching links such as graduation design and graduation thesis, organize students to conduct more systematic research. For example, this year's graduation design for the mechanical manufacturing major in the Mechanical Engineering Department was to design and trial-produce an "automatic tap production line" at the Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, and to design and trial-produce an "automatic gear production line" at the Qijiang Automotive Parts Factory.

    According to teaching requirements and the actual situation of the production site, conducting research on scientific and technological issues in engineering design, construction, process flow, and new product trial production is the main method for the institute to organize students to participate in scientific research during production labor. During the labor period in the school-run machine manufacturing factory, first-year students of the Mechanical Engineering Department studied issues such as "selection of nodulizing agents for nodular cast iron" and "precision casting" in conjunction with the course content of "Introduction to Thermal Processing." When fourth-year students majoring in leather in the Chemical Engineering Department participated in production labor at the Chengdu No. 2 Leather Factory, they researched and solved some key problems of loose surface of cowhide leather, promoting the improvement of production quality.

    In addition, in some senior students of some majors, time is arranged in the education plan to organize them to conduct some project-based scientific research in a more concentrated manner, so that they can be further trained and improved. Under the guidance of teachers, fourth-year students of the Electrical Engineering Department spent one month focusing on five special research tasks related to the Yangtze River Three Gorges power system and put forward some unique opinions.

    When organizing students to participate in scientific research, the Chengdu Institute of Technology pays special attention to strengthening teaching activities in the research process and fully leveraging the leading role of teachers. Each department generally adopts methods such as systematically lecturing in combination with scientific research content, giving special lectures, assigning relevant assignments, and requiring students to write reading reports. On the one hand, the Inorganic Materials Engineering Department of the Chemical Engineering Department conducts regular lectures according to the needs and progress of scientific research, organizes students to consult literature and write reading reports. On the other hand, it also assigns calculation and thinking questions to address the problems existing in students' scientific research, holds regular technical summaries and scientific research report meetings to help students independently study and think, and improve their ability to analyze and judge and solve practical problems. In order to give full play to the leading role of teachers, each department widely adopts the form of special research groups: taking one or several research projects of similar nature as the center, under the leadership of the Party organization, research groups are formed with the participation of teachers, students, and capable people (technical personnel and workers from production units, etc.). This not only strengthens the specific leadership of the Party but also strengthens teachers, students, technicians, and workers. The connection between people facilitates learning from each other's strengths and compensating for weaknesses, promoting each other, and enabling teachers to better help students in every aspect of the research work.

    Due to a series of measures to closely combine scientific research work with teaching and production labor, in the past year, the Chengdu Institute of Technology has not only made significant contributions to national construction but also provided teachers and students with more comprehensive training, and the quality of teaching has been significantly improved.

    成都工学院结合教学　联系生产
    本报讯　成都工学院密切结合教学和生产劳动，有计划地组织学生参加科学研究工作，帮助学生进一步掌握理论知识和生产技能，培养独立工作能力，教学质量因而得到显著提高，科学研究工作也出现空前跃进的局面。
    今年以来，成都工学院参加科学研究工作的师生共有一千一百多人。到11月底为止，全院共完成了一百三十二项研究任务，占全年计划的86％，比1958年以前七年中完成的研究项目的总和，还多四十多项。其中有四十七项研究成果，已经提交生产单位研究运用。
    在组织学生参加科学研究的工作中，成都工学院贯彻执行了结合教学需要和联系生产实际的原则，把科学研究列入了教育计划，并对教学、劳动和科学研究三方面作了统一而妥善的安排。在科学研究的内容方面，各系都紧密结合教学进程，按照不同专业不同年级学生在各个时期的学习内容，安排了不同方面和不同性质的任务。这些任务包括：准备新试验、结合教学的专题研究、设计与试制新产品、研究新技术、总结生产经验和进行理论问题研究等。这样，既能完成一定的研究任务，又能提高学生的知识水平，使其得到比较全面的锻炼。
    成都工学院对学生参加科学研究的具体安排，主要有与教学结合以及与生产劳动结合两个方面。在结合教学环节上，他们按适应教学要求的原则，采用的办法有以下几种：一、把部分实验课与科学研究工作结合，进行专题实验研究。二、结合课程作业和课程设计，进行有关科学研究题目的设计计算部分。三、在毕业设计和毕业论文等教学环节中，组织学生进行更有系统的研究。如机械系机械制造专业今年的毕业设计，就是在成都量具刃具厂进行“丝锥生产自动线”的设计试制，以及在綦江汽车配件厂进行“齿轮生产自动线”的设计试制。
    根据教学要求和生产现场实际情况，进行工程设计、施工、工艺过程、新产品试制等方面科学技术问题的研究，是该院组织学生在生产劳动中参加科学研究的主要办法。机械系一年级学生在校办机械制造厂劳动期间，就结合“热加工概论”课程内容，研究了“球墨铸铁的球化剂选择”“精密铸造”等方面的问题。化工系皮革专业四年级学生在成都制革二厂参加生产劳动时，研究解决了牛皮面革松面的一些关键问题，促进了生产质量的提高。
    此外，在一些专业的高年级学生中，还采取了在教育计划中安排时间，组织他们比较集中地进行一些项目的科学研究，使其进一步得到锻炼提高。电机系四年级学生在教师指导下，就以一月时间集中进行了有关长江三峡电力系统的五项专题研究任务，还提出了一些独到的意见。
    在组织学生参加科学研究时，成都工学院特别注意在研究过程里加强教学活动，并充分地发挥教师的主导作用。各系一般采用了结合科学研究内容系统讲课、专题讲授、布置有关作业以及要求学生写读书报告等办法。化工系无机物工学专业一方面按科学研究需要和进程定期讲课，组织学生查阅文献、写读书报告，一方面还针对学生在科学研究中存在的问题，布置计算和思考题，举行定期技术小结和科研报告会，帮助学生独立钻研思考，提高分析判断与解决实际问题的能力。为了充分发挥教师的主导作用，各系广泛采用了专题研究组的形式：以一个或几个性质相近的研究项目为中心，在党组织领导下，组成有教师、学生、能者（生产单位技术人员、工人等）三方面参加的研究组。这样，不仅加强了党的具体领导，更加密切了教师、学生和技术员、工人之间的联系，便于取长补短，相互促进，并且使教师能够通过研究工作中各个环节更好地对学生进行具体帮助。
    由于采取一系列措施把科学研究工作与教学和生产劳动密切结合，一年以来，成都工学院不仅对国家建设作出了不小贡献，教师、学生也都得到更加全面的锻炼，教学质量有了显著的提高。
