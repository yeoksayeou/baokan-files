Pharmaceutical Capitalists Raise Drug Prices
    Elderly and Infirm Cannot Afford Medicine
    Due to the high cost of drugs, many Americans now cannot afford them. However, the profit rate of American pharmaceutical capitalists has reached 7000%.
    Some letters from American citizens, recently read aloud at the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly, illustrate this situation.
    One letter states: "I am a farmer and am seventy-one years old. My wife and I both have arthritis. It costs twenty-five to twenty-six cents to buy one arthritis pill, and three and a half pills cost one bushel (nearly 28 kilograms) of grain."
    An elderly woman from California wrote in her letter: "We are all old and sick people. Eight of us live on the same street and receive less than one hundred dollars a month in pensions. Our medical expenses are about thirty dollars a month, sometimes more. What are we to do? There is also an eighty-four-year-old man living here who constantly cries out in pain from arthritis... We would all rather die than live this way."
    Another letter states: "My wife and I are both seventy-five years old. My wife has paralysis; I hope to live on a pension of less than one hundred dollars a month... but I have to sell some things my wife needs to pay for medicine... Should some of us die simply to ensure the maximum profits of pharmaceutical companies by constantly draining our lifeblood?"
    Senator Smathers said at a committee meeting that in the Soviet Union, people can buy antibiotics for only forty-five cents, while in the United States, it costs three dollars and fifty cents. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 制药资本家抬高药价  老弱病者买不起药品

　　制药资本家抬高药价
    老弱病者买不起药品
    由于药品价格高昂，许多美国人现在买不起药品。而美国制药业资本家的利润率却达到7000％。
    最近在美国参议院垄断问题小组委员会中宣读的一些美国公民来信，说明了一些情况。
    有一封信说：“我是个农民，已经七十一岁了。我和我的妻子都得了关节炎。买一片治关节炎的药片要花二角五分到二角六分钱，买三片半药片就要花一蒲式耳（将近二十八公斤）的谷物。”
    加利福尼亚的一位老妇人在信中写道：“我们都是老而多病的人。我们八个人都住在同一条街上，所得的养老金每月不到一百美元。我们的医药费每月大约要三十美元，有时还要多些。我们怎么办呢？这里还住有一位八十四岁的老头，他经常由于关节炎痛得叫喊不停……我们大家都宁愿死去，也不愿过这种生活”。
    还有一封信写道：“我和我的妻子都七十五岁了。我的妻子得了瘫痪症；我希望靠每月不到一百美元的养老金来过活……但是我不得不变卖我妻子所必需的一些东西来支付药费……难道只是为了制药公司不断榨取我们的脂膏来保证他们的最大利润，我们中某些人就应该死去吗？”
    参议员斯马瑟斯在委员会会议上说，在苏联，人们只要花四角五分就可以买到抗生素，而在美国要花三元五角。（新华社）
