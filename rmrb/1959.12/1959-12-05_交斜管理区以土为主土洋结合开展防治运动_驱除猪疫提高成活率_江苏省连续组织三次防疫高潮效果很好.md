    Jiaoxie Management Area Launches Prevention and Control Campaign Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods to Eradicate Swine Fever and Improve Survival Rate
    Jiangsu Province Continuously Organizes Three Anti-epidemic Upsurges with Remarkable Results
    This newspaper, Xi’an, 4th dispatch: The Jiaoxie Management Area of Gushi Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, primarily relies on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign techniques to launch a mass swine fever prevention and control campaign. This has basically controlled swine fever and greatly promoted the development of the pig-raising industry. From January to October this year, the entire management area raised 13,598 pigs, with a survival rate increasing from 78% in 1958 to 97.7%.
    In preventing and controlling swine fever, the Jiaoxie Management Area has harnessed the power of various local indigenous methods. The masses in this area have over one hundred types of indigenous methods for preventing and controlling swine fever, including preventive, curative, and integrated approaches. The masses have many treatment methods for one type of swine disease. For example, to reduce the body temperature of pigs suffering from heat-induced illnesses, the local masses use methods such as acupuncture on hooves, ears, and tails, and feeding the pigs mung bean water, salt water, and licorice water. Old farmer Ju Huanzhang, a pig-raising expert from Qiufeng Production Team, can diagnose and treat over twenty types of swine diseases. This year, under his guidance, none of the 493 pigs in the production team's six pig farms died from disease. The advantages of using these indigenous methods are: low cost and high effectiveness. For example, for the most common gastrointestinal diseases in pigs (diarrhea or constipation), feeding a clove of garlic quickly stops diarrhea, and drinking a bowl of salt water can cure constipation the same day. These indigenous methods are simple and easy to promote. In just over half a year, the vast majority of the 156 feeders and epidemic prevention workers in this management area have become "pig doctors." While extensively using indigenous methods, this management area also adopted foreign methods as much as possible. During the spring and winter epidemic seasons each year, whether the pigs are raised collectively by the production team or by commune members' families, they receive at least two vaccinations, and some production teams have achieved quarterly vaccinations.
    Ensuring food hygiene and keeping pigsties dry are among the most effective measures for preventing and controlling swine fever in this management area. The wild grass, tree leaves, and crop vines used for feeding pigs in this management area undergo strict inspection to prevent poisonous weeds and moldy weeds from introducing bacteria. Green fodder is chopped, dry fodder is crushed and sieved, and substitute concentrated feed is ground and cooked, ensuring strict disinfection and nutrition. To ensure that each pig eats an appropriate amount, pig farms in the management area have implemented separate feeding troughs according to the different needs of sows, meat pigs, feeder pigs, piglets, and the speed at which they eat, and their temperament. Feed containers and troughs are rinsed and disinfected with boiling water or alkaline water before and after feeding. All sixty-four collectively-run pig farms in the management area have built bathing pools, allowing pigs to bathe every day in the summer. In winter, pig pens are covered with sheds and lined with dry grass to prevent pigs from freezing.
    For years, this area has been the source of swine fever outbreaks among Weinan, Dali, and Pucheng counties. The number of pigs dying from swine fever generally reaches one-fourth to one-third. Taking Qiufeng Production Team (formerly advanced cooperative), which has raised a relatively large number of pigs and has a good record in epidemic prevention work, as an example, in 1957, it raised 780 pigs, but 520 of them died in an epidemic in October. In light of this situation, the Jiaoxie Management Area Party General Branch has greatly strengthened its leadership in preventing and controlling swine fever this year. First, it launched a mass swine fever prevention and control campaign, using collectively-run pig farms as a base, thereby increasing the survival rate of pigs raised in collectively-run pig farms from 50% last year to 98.8%. Second, it carefully summarized the various experiences of Qiufeng Production Team in preventing and controlling swine fever and promoted them through on-site meetings, field visits, and training courses. Qiufeng Production Team has already held three training courses and nine on-site meetings from January to October, promptly promoting new epidemic prevention experiences. When some difficult-to-distinguish epidemic symptoms are discovered, they immediately organize all the team's feeders and epidemic prevention workers to consult, which not only correctly diagnoses and treats the epidemic diseases but also improves everyone's skill level. Gao Xixian, secretary of the Management Area Party General Branch, and the branch secretaries of each production team, personally take charge of the pig-raising business, and the Party General Branch members and the members of each branch are also assigned to lead the pig-raising business by area. The management area established a livestock and epidemic prevention station, and the production teams and production brigades established epidemic prevention workers, who regularly patrol and prevent epidemic diseases.
    Currently, during the winter epidemic season, this management area has listed protecting pigs safely through the winter as one of the current central tasks and has launched a mass winter epidemic prevention campaign.

    This newspaper, Nanjing, 4th dispatch: Jiangsu Province has further controlled the spread of the most serious swine diseases, such as swine fever, swine erysipelas, and swine pleuropneumonia, and the province's mortality rate from infectious pig diseases has decreased from 0.7% last year to 0.3%. Key pig-raising counties such as Taixing, Taizhou, Jingjiang, and Hai'an have not experienced infectious diseases such as swine fever this year.
    The smooth progress of epidemic prevention work is mainly due to the importance attached by the Party committee, the full utilization of the favorable conditions of the People's Commune, and the establishment of professional organizations and the vigorous launch of mass movements. At the beginning of this year, livestock and veterinary departments and breeding farms at all levels conscientiously summarized the occurrence patterns of pig diseases over the years. While further improving feeding management, they carried out surprise epidemic prevention campaigns in different seasons and regions based on the condition of the pig population, ensuring that epidemic prevention work was proactive and thorough every season. The province continuously organized three anti-epidemic upsurges this year: The first upsurge was carried out in February, targeting the new pig population composition after the Spring Festival, and adopted the method of administering swine fever, erysipelas, and pleuropneumonia vaccines all at once, ensuring the healthy development of the new pig population. The second anti-epidemic upsurge was organized in June. At that time, swine erysipelas was about to raise its head, and the epidemic prevention department focused on the old epidemic areas along both sides of the Yangtze River while also taking care of other areas, implementing a comprehensive encirclement and suppression to give erysipelas a head-on blow. In September, as the weather gradually cooled, the season when pleuropneumonia is most likely to occur, the third anti-epidemic upsurge was organized. This time, the focus was on preventing pleuropneumonia and swine fever, combined with preventive injections for erysipelas and paratyphoid fever in piglets, with good results.
    This year, all localities have attached great importance to prevention and control work, so the survival rate of piglets has greatly improved, and the number of live pigs in pens has rapidly increased. Relevant departments in Jiangsu Province plan to organize symposiums and on-site meetings in counties this winter to summarize the experience in preventing and controlling piglet diseases.

    交斜管理区以土为主土洋结合开展防治运动
    驱除猪疫提高成活率
    江苏省连续组织三次防疫高潮效果很好
    本报西安4日电　陕西省渭南县固市公社交斜管理区，以土法为主，土洋结合，开展群众性的防治猪疫运动，基本上控制了猪疫，大大促进了养猪事业的发展。全管理区今年1至10月养猪一万三千五百九十八头，成活率由1958年的78％上升为97.7％。
    交斜管理区防治猪疫中，发挥了当地各种土办法的威力。这个地区群众防治猪疫的土办法共有一百多种，其中有预防的、治疗的，防、治兼顾的。猪的一种疫病，群众有很多种治疗方法。例如猪受热发生疫病，为了给猪降低体温，当地群众采用的办法有针扎蹄、扎耳、扎尾巴，给猪喝绿豆水、盐开水、甘草水等。秋丰生产队养猪能手巨焕章老汉，能给猪诊治二十多种疫病。今年全生产队六个养猪场在他指导下，四百九十三头猪没有一头发生疫病死亡。采用这些土办法的好处是：花钱少，效果大。例如猪最容易发生的肠胃病（拉稀或结症），喂一棵大蒜很快就制止了拉稀，喝一碗盐开水当天就可治好结症。这些土办法的技术简便，容易推广。只半年多，这个管理区一百五十六个饲养员和防疫员，绝大多数都成了“猪医生”。这个管理区在大量采用土办法的同时，也尽可能采用了洋办法。每年春季和冬季疫病流行期间，不论生产队集体养的或社员家庭养的猪，至少都打两次以上的防疫针，有的生产队已经做到了季季打防疫针。
    做到食物卫生、圈内干燥，是这个管理区防治猪疫中最有效的措施之一。这个管理区喂猪的野草、树叶和庄稼叶蔓，都要经过严格检验，严防毒草和霉烂杂草带进细菌。青饲草都切碎，干饲草经过碾碎、筛过，代精饲料都经过磨碎、煮熟，既做到严格消毒，又保证营养。为了使每头猪吃食适量，管理区各猪场都实行了按照母猪、肉猪、架子猪、小猪和吃得快慢、性情强弱等不同情况，分槽喂食。吃前吃后的食筒食槽，都要经过开水或盐碱水冲刷消毒。全管理区六十四个集体养猪场，个个都建立了洗澡池，夏天让猪天天洗澡。在冬天，猪圈上盖棚子，下铺干草，防止猪受冻。
    历年来，这里都是渭南、大荔、蒲城三县之间的猪疫发源地。因猪疫而发生死亡的猪，一般达四分之一到三分之一。就以历年来养猪较多、防疫工作较好的秋丰生产队（原高级社）来说，1957年养了七百八十头猪，但在10月间的一次疫病中，就死亡五百二十头。根据这种情况，交斜管理区党总支今年大大加强了防治猪疫的领导。首先是以集体养猪场为基地，开展了群众性的防治猪疫运动，从而使集体养猪场养猪成活率由去年的50％上升为98.8％。其次是认真地总结了秋丰生产队防治猪疫的多种经验，通过现场会议、实地参观和举办训练班等办法加以推广。秋丰生产队1至10月已经举办了三次训练班，召开了九次现场会议，及时推广新的防疫经验。当发现某些较难分辨的疫症时，他们立即组织全队饲养员、防疫员会诊，既正确地诊治了疫病，又提高了大家的水平。管理区党总支书记高希贤和各生产队的支部书记，都亲自抓养猪事业，党总支委员和各支部的委员也都划片包干，领导养猪事业。管理区成立了畜牧防疫站，生产队和生产小队都设立了防疫员，经常巡回防治疫病。
    目前正值冬季疫病流行期间，这个管理区已经把保护猪安全过冬列为当前的中心工作之一，开展了群众性的越冬防疫运动。

    本报南京4日电　江苏省进一步控制了危害猪最严重的猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫等病疫的流行，全省猪的传染病死亡率已从去年的0.7％下降到0.3％。泰兴、泰州、靖江、海安等重点养猪县，今年从未发生猪瘟等传染病。
    防疫工作的顺利开展，主要是党委重视，充分运用人民公社的有利条件，建立了专业组织和大搞群众运动的结果。各级畜牧兽医部门和饲养场，今年一开始就认真总结了历年来猪病疫的发生规律，在进一步改善饲养管理的同时，根据猪群情况，在不同季节、不同地区开展突击防疫运动，使防疫工作季季主动，步步深入。全省今年连续组织了三次防疫高潮：第一次高潮是在2月份进行的，针对春节后新的猪群组成的时候，采取了猪瘟、丹毒、肺疫三针一齐打的办法，保证了新猪群健康发展。6月份又组织了第二个防疫高潮。当时是猪丹毒即将抬头的时候，防疫部门以长江两岸的老疫区为重点同时照顾其他带，实行全面围剿，给丹毒以迎头痛击。9月份天气渐凉，是肺疫最易发生的季节，又组织了第三次防疫高潮。这次以预防肺疫、猪瘟为主，结合了丹毒和小猪副伤寒的预防注射，效果很好。
    今年各地十分重视防治工作，因此小猪成活率大大提高，生猪圈存量迅速增长。江苏省有关部门打算在今冬以县为单位，组织座谈会和现场会，总结防治小猪病疫的经验。　（王珊）
