Xinhua News Agency, December 17th. Overseas Chinese who formerly resided in Indonesia have successively issued statements, citing many facts to illustrate the close friendship that overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people have forged in labor and in the struggle against common enemies, and the undeniable contributions they have made to Indonesia's economic development. They pointed out that the lies fabricated by interested influential elements in Indonesia, such as Indonesian overseas Chinese being a "fifth column" and overseas Chinese economy being a "remnant of colonialist economy," are completely excuses for the mad persecution of overseas Chinese, and are extremely detrimental to the friendship between the two peoples.

Many returned overseas Chinese talked about how they fought alongside the Indonesian people against Japanese imperialism and Dutch colonialism, and supported the Indonesian national independence movement. Chen Kaikun, head of the No. 1 furnace of the Jiaozuo Mining Machinery Plant, who lived in Indonesia for many years, Xu Jianxiang, a worker at the North China Radio Equipment Factory, and Chen Meixing, a tin miner who returned from Bangka Island, Indonesia, all participated in the struggle against Dutch colonialism and Japanese imperialism. Chen Meixing said: One of my elder brothers was beaten to death for refusing to repair the airport for Japanese imperialism. In 1945, overseas Chinese workers at the tin mine held demonstrations and rallies against Dutch colonialism and launched donation activities. In 1950, in order to demand increased wages, overseas Chinese workers and Indonesian workers held a three-day strike against Dutch colonialists. Chen Meixing and Xu Jianxiang both personally participated in these activities and contributed their strength. Chen Kaikun still cherishes a commemorative medal, which commemorates the more than ten overseas Chinese who sacrificed themselves on September 20, 1942, in order to oppose the Japanese imperialist invasion of Indonesia. The broad masses of overseas Chinese regarded these people who fought alongside the Indonesian people and shed their last drop of blood as role models. Now, influential forces in Indonesia are calling overseas Chinese a "fifth column." Isn't this ulterior motives?

Yang Qingbai, a returned overseas Chinese who lived in Indonesia for decades and is now a representative of the People's Congress of Fuqing County, Fujian Province, and a member of the County People's Committee, said that from 1929, when he was seventeen years old, to 1951, when he was thirty-nine years old, he worked as a small rural merchant and a small town handicraftsman in Indonesia, dedicating all his energy during his youth and prime to connecting and enlivening the economic life of the Indonesian urban and rural people. Recalling the scene when he was a small merchant, he said: At that time, regardless of storms, torrential rain, or scorching heat, and regardless of Sundays or holidays, every day from dawn to dusk, he rode a cargo bicycle to the market to buy oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, small groceries, and other daily necessities to supply the needs of the poor rural people; he also transported various small local products from the countryside to the city for sale. So honestly and diligently working, he could only obtain meager profits to maintain his life. Overseas Chinese small merchants and vendors have become an inseparable part of the local economic life in this way. Overseas Chinese and local people take care of and help each other, and have established a close relationship. Many Indonesian people call overseas Chinese "relatives." When Japanese imperialism invaded Indonesia, many overseas Chinese also fought alongside the local people against the Japanese and Dutch imperialists, forging a blood-and-flesh friendship. Saying that the overseas Chinese economy is a so-called "remnant of colonialist economy," isn't this ulterior motives? Zhang Meiying, a student at the Beijing Institute of Architectural Engineering and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said: My father left his hometown at the age of fourteen to work in Indonesia, and he is now sixty-two years old. From the day he arrived in Indonesia, he and many other overseas Chinese worked with the Indonesian people to develop Lombok Island, a desolate area in southern Bali. In nearly fifty years, he has worked as a carpenter, mason, tailor, cook, and also opened a small shop. He has contributed all his youth to the development and prosperity of this small island. Now the economy there has gradually prospered and the population has increased. However, our family's shop has recently been squeezed out and is already nominally dead, and the twelve members of the family are even experiencing difficulties in life. The anti-Chinese activities launched by some influential forces in Indonesia are completely an act of treating friends as enemies.

Lin Xinquan, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia and a representative of Jiangxi Province attending the National Overseas Chinese Federation Conference in Shanghai, said: "I was born in Kun Dian Po Hu Ru Town, Kalimantan, Indonesia. According to my parents, it was originally a wasteland, inhabited by only a few fishermen and three overseas Chinese families. Due to inconvenient transportation, the fishermen could not transport their dried fish out, and the industrial products they needed could not be transported in, making life extremely painful. Through the joint efforts of local fishermen and overseas Chinese to clear the way, the fishing industry gradually developed, a coconut grove was planted, and the population gradually increased, with more than twenty shops. Due to the transportation by overseas Chinese small merchants, the local fishermen could not only transport their fresh fish out, but also buy the industrial products they needed in a timely manner. However, in the few years before I returned to China, because Dutch monopoly capital controlled all coconut copra purchases, the price of coconut copra plummeted, causing rural bankruptcy. The coconut gardens in Hu Ru Town were desolate because no one managed them. Indonesian fishermen, farmers, and overseas Chinese were successively forced to migrate, leaving this small town they had jointly developed and scattered in all directions. My father is buried there. Every time my mother sweeps his grave, she always remembers the different experiences of this place before and after the Dutch monopolized coconut copra purchases." Lin Xinquan said indignantly: The local overseas Chinese and Indonesian people all know that it was the Dutch colonialists who caused the bankruptcy of Indonesian rural areas and hindered economic development. Why do some people in Indonesia reverse black and white and slander the overseas Chinese economy as a "remnant of colonialist economy"?

Overseas Chinese who have returned from Indonesia also talked about their close friendship with the Indonesian people. Xie Ruimei, a student at the Beijing Broadcasting Institute, recalled the scene when she left Indonesia to return to China, saying: "At that time, many neighbors and friends came to see me off in an endless stream, and many people cried. They repeatedly told me like their own daughters, and asked me to write often. Even now, I can't forget these dear Indonesian villagers." The returned overseas Chinese expressed their gratitude to the Indonesian people for their sympathy and support to the overseas Chinese in this anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese trend, and eagerly hoped that their relatives and those overseas Chinese who have been persecuted and displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia, will return to the motherland and participate in the socialist construction of the great motherland.

    华侨是印度尼西亚人民的亲人
    归国侨胞用具体事实驳斥疯狂迫害华侨的借口
    新华社17日讯　过去居住在印度尼西亚的归国华侨纷纷发表谈话，举出许多事实说明华侨和印度尼西亚人民在劳动和反对共同敌人的斗争中久已结成了亲密的友谊，并且为印度尼西亚经济的发展作出了不可抹煞的贡献。他们指出印度尼西亚别有用心的有势力分子制造的所谓印度尼西亚华侨是“第五纵队”、华侨经济是“殖民主义经济残余”的谰言，完全是为疯狂迫害华侨制造借口，极其不利于两国人民的友谊。
    许多归侨谈到了他们和印度尼西亚人民并肩反对日本帝国主义和荷兰殖民主义者、支持印度尼西亚民族独立运动的情形。曾在印度尼西亚住过多年的焦作矿山机械厂青年一号炉炉长陈开坤、华北无线电器材厂工人许建祥和从印度尼西亚邦加岛归来的锡矿工人陈梅兴，都参加过反对荷兰殖民主义和日本帝国主义的斗争。陈梅兴说：我的一个哥哥就是因为拒绝替日本帝国主义修飞机场而被打死的。1945年锡矿上的华侨工人举行过反对荷兰殖民主义者的游行集会并开展捐献活动，1950年为了要求增加工资，华侨工人和印度尼西亚工人一起向荷兰殖民主义者举行了三天罢工。陈梅兴、许建祥都亲身参加过这些活动，贡献了自己的力量。陈开坤现在还珍藏着一枚纪念章，那是纪念1942年9月20日为了反对日本帝国主义侵略印度尼西亚而牺牲的十多位华侨的纪念章。广大华侨把这些跟印度尼西亚人民并肩作战并流尽了最后一滴血的人当作楷模。现在印度尼西亚的有影响的势力却把华侨说成是“第五纵队”，这不是别有用心是什么呢？
    曾在印度尼西亚住了几十年，现在是福建省福清县人民代表和县人民委员会委员的归侨杨清柏说，他从1929年十七岁起到1951年三十九岁时止，在印度尼西亚先后做过乡村小商贩和小集镇手工业者，为沟通和活跃印度尼西亚城乡人民经济生活，献出了自己青春和壮年时期的全部精力。他回顾做小商贩时的情景说：当时不管暴风、骤雨、酷暑，也不管是星期天或节日假期，每天从清晨到黑夜，他都骑着载货自行车，到集市购买油盐酱醋、小杂货和其他生活必需品，供应穷乡僻壤的当地人民的需要；还把乡间各种小土产，运到城里去出卖。如此安分守己，辛勤劳动，个人只能取得薄利，维持生活。华侨小商小贩就是这样地成为当地经济生活中密切不可分离的部分，华侨同当地人民互相照顾、互相帮助，建立了亲密无间的关系，许多印度尼西亚人民称呼华侨为“亲人”。日本帝国主义侵略印度尼西亚时，许多华侨还同当地人民并肩反抗日本和荷兰帝国主义者，结成了血肉的友谊。说华侨经济是所谓“殖民主义经济残余”，这不是别有用心吗？北京建筑工业学院学生、印度尼西亚归侨张美英说：我的父亲十四岁就离开家乡到印度尼西亚去做工，今年已经六十二岁了。从到达印度尼西亚的那一天起，他就和其他许多华侨同印度尼西亚人民一起，开发峇厘岛南部原来一片荒凉的龙目岛。在将近五十年的时间里，他做过木工、泥工、裁缝、厨师，还开过小店，他为这个小岛的开发与繁荣贡献了自己的全部青春。现在那里的经济已经逐渐繁荣，人口也多起来了。而我们家的店铺近来却受到排挤，已经名存实亡，一家十二口连生活都发生了困难。印度尼西亚的一部分有影响的势力所掀起的排华活动，完全是一种以友为敌的行为。
    在上海出席全国侨联会议的江西省代表，印度尼西亚归侨林信泉说：“我出生在印度尼西亚加里曼丹坤甸坡呼如镇。据我父母说，原来那里是一片荒地，只住着几户渔民和三户华侨。由于交通不便，渔民的鱼干运不出去，所需要的工业品也运不进来，生活异常痛苦。经过当地渔民和华侨共同披荆斩棘，渔业逐渐发展，种起了一片椰林，人口逐渐增多，有了二十多家商店。由于华侨小商贩的运输，当地渔民的鲜鱼不但能运出去，而且能及时买到他们所需要的工业品。但是，在我回国前几年，由于荷兰垄断资本掌握了全部椰干收购权，椰干价格一落千丈，造成农村破产。呼如镇的椰园因无人管理而一片荒凉。印度尼西亚的渔民、农民和华侨都陆续被迫迁移，离开这个共同开发的小集镇，流落四方。我的父亲是葬在那里的，母亲每次扫墓时，总会想起荷兰人垄断椰干收购权前后，这块地方的不同遭遇。”林信泉愤慨地说：当地的华侨和印度尼西亚人民都知道使印度尼西亚农村破产、经济发展受到阻碍的是荷兰殖民者，为什么印度尼西亚某些人竟颠倒黑白，诬蔑华侨经济是“殖民主义经济残余”呢？
    从印度尼西亚归国的华侨们还谈到了他们和印度尼西亚人民的亲密友谊。北京广播学院学生谢瑞妹回忆自己离开印度尼西亚回国时的情景说：“当时很多邻居、朋友都川流不息地来送我，不少人还哭了。他们像对自己的亲生女儿一样千叮咛万嘱咐，要我经常去信。直到现在，我都忘不了这些亲爱的印度尼西亚乡亲父老”。归国华侨们对印度尼西亚人民在这次反华排华逆流中给予华侨的同情和支持表示感谢，并且热切希望自己的亲人和那些受到迫害而颠沛流离、无以为生或不愿继续留居在印度尼西亚的华侨回到祖国，参加伟大祖国的社会主义建设。
