   "Pig-Raising Fanatic"
    ——A Record of Stockman Liu Qingcai
    By Our Correspondent Cai Ming

    Liu Qingcai is a stockman at the pig farm of the Caijia Management Area, Guojiadian Commune, Lishu County, Jilin Province. This man truly "takes the farm as his home" and "loves pigs like his own children." The commune members respect him very much for his enthusiasm in raising pigs; some even gave him the nickname: "Pig-Raising Fanatic."

    As early as 1956, during the agricultural cooperative period, this place began collective pig raising, but the number was small, only about twenty. In the summer of 1957, unfortunately, a hog cholera epidemic occurred, killing more than two-thirds of the pigs privately raised by the members, and leaving only two of the collectively raised pigs. Therefore, many people were unwilling to raise pigs. In order to persist in collective pig raising, the agricultural cooperative bought eighteen pigs from other places and selected the diligent and capable Liu Qingcai as the stockman. Liu Qingcai was also afraid of another outbreak of hog cholera, but instead of refusing to do it, he happily accepted the task and tried every means to raise the pigs well.

    Sure enough, under Liu Qingcai's careful care, these twenty pigs not only did not get sick but also gave birth to more than thirty piglets in less than half a year. Seeing that the pigs could be raised well, the cooperative officially established a pig farm and added stockmen. As a result, the production teams also started collective pig raising, and the members' enthusiasm for raising pigs gradually increased, and they started raising pigs one after another. Up to now, the Caijia Management Area has raised more than nine hundred pigs, averaging 1.2 pigs per person, an eightfold increase compared to 1957. Among them, collectively raised pigs account for more than 70% of the total number, making it a red flag in the development of the pig-raising industry in Jilin Province.

    Last winter, with the establishment of the commune, the collective pig-raising business further developed. At that time, due to a lack of timber, pigsties could not be built. Without enough pigsties, how could the safety of sows and piglets during the winter be guaranteed? At that time, Liu Qingcai racked his brains day and night to find a solution, sometimes unable to sleep at night. One night, after he finished a meeting at the pig farm and returned home, he had just fallen asleep when he heard the big and small pigs screaming in the wind and snow, and a chaotic scene appeared before his eyes. When he approached the pigpen, several old sows rushed towards him with a group of piglets. He was so frightened that he turned around suddenly and fell into a vegetable cellar. He woke up and realized it was a dream. But he couldn't fall asleep anymore. While putting on his clothes, he pondered: Yes, putting vegetables in a cellar prevents them from freezing. Digging a vegetable cellar requires less labor and materials than building a house. Wouldn't it be good to raise pigs in a cellar? He hurried back to the pig farm, which was at one o'clock in the morning. He gestured and planned in the pig farm. Before dawn, a drawing of an underground pigsty was completed. The leaders of the management area praised his design, saying that it could keep warm and save materials, and actively supported him. Then, he and everyone else worked hard for two days and two nights and built five underground pigsties. That winter, more than forty underground pigsties were dug, allowing the farm's weak pigs, sows, and piglets to safely survive the severe winter. This type of underground pigsty has been well received by the vast number of cadres and members of Jilin Province, and people have been coming to visit and learn from it ever since.

    Not long after the pig farm was established, a batch of weak pigs arrived. When the management area bought these pigs, many people thought that they could not be raised well, but Liu Qingcai automatically took fifteen skin-and-bone sows. This made him even busier. He studied the habits and characteristics of each pig day and night. Once, a pig did not eat for a day, and he was worried if it was sick; but the next day it returned to normal. He observed it for several days before realizing that it was a "food-snatching pig," eating one full meal and then starving for the next, so it naturally didn't want to eat the next meal after eating too much. So, he adopted a fixed-time and fixed-quantity method, allowing each pig to eat evenly, and the problem was solved. In this way, he became very familiar with the habits of each pig. After more than a month of feeding, these thin pigs not only did not die but also gradually became fat.

    Some people say that Liu Qingcai is like a living dictionary of pig raising, which is true. He knows exactly which pig is pregnant and when each pig will give birth. As long as a pig is giving birth, regardless of day or night, rain or snow, he will be there to deliver the baby, often not getting a wink of sleep all night. At the end of last November, a sow with only twelve teats gave birth to nineteen piglets. The sow's milk was not enough for the piglets to eat, which made him extremely anxious. Coincidentally, the next day a sow gave birth to only five piglets. So he thought: wouldn't the problem be solved if a few of the piglets were given to this sow to nurse? However, when he put those piglets next to this sow, the sow sniffed them all over and then opened her mouth to bite them. He hurriedly picked up the piglets. But this made Liu Qingcai realize something. He thought: probably the sows have a keen sense of smell and can tell whether they gave birth to the piglets. He tried wiping the piglets with the sow's placenta, and sure enough, the sow allowed the piglets to nurse. However, one placenta could not wipe several piglets, so he came up with the idea of washing the piglets with the sow's urine, which also had the same effect. In the course of feeding, Liu Qingcai also paid attention to studying the distribution of the sow's mammary glands. He found that the milk from the two teats in the middle was more than usual, so he placed the weaker piglets on the teats with more milk, according to the piglets' habit of not eating the teats randomly. Therefore, the piglets he fed were all healthy.

    In his work, Liu Qingcai not only worked hard but also paid attention to studying scientific knowledge of pig raising. Since the establishment of the farm, the pigs he raised have never had an epidemic, the sows have achieved full mating, full pregnancy, full production, and full survival, and the piglets have achieved full strength.

   “养猪迷”
    ——记饲养员刘清才
    本报记者　蔡明
    刘清才，是吉林省梨树县郭家店公社蔡家管理区养猪场的饲养员。这个人真正做到“以场为家”，“爱猪如子”。公社社员看到他十分热心养猪，都很尊敬他；有人还给他起了个绰号：“养猪迷”。
    远在1956年农业社时，这个地方就开始了集体养猪，不过为数不多，只有二十多头。1957年夏天，不幸发生了一场猪瘟，社员私养的猪死了三分之二以上，集体饲养的猪也只剩下两头。因此，好些人都不愿养猪了。农业社为了坚持集体养猪，又由外地买了十八头猪回来，并且挑选勤劳能干的刘清才当饲养员。刘清才也害怕再闹猪瘟，不过他不是拒绝不干，而是愉快地接受了这个任务，千方百计把猪养好。
    果然，这二十头猪在刘清才的精心饲养下，不仅没有发病，不到半年工夫还下了三十多个小猪。社里看到猪能养好，便正式建立起养猪场，加派了饲养人员。这一来，各生产队也开始了集体养猪，社员们的养猪情绪逐渐提高，陆续养起猪来。到现在为止，蔡家管理区的猪已经养了九百多头，平均每人有猪一点二头，比1957年提高八倍。其中集体饲养的猪占总头数的70％以上，成为吉林省发展养猪事业的一面红旗。
    去冬办起公社，集体养猪事业进一步发展起来。当时因木料缺乏，猪舍盖不起来。猪舍不够，怎么能保证母猪、仔猪安全过冬呢？那时节，刘清才日日夜夜挖尽心思想办法，有时夜晚也睡不着觉。一天晚上，他在猪场开完会回到家，刚刚睡着，只听得大猪小猪被满天的风雪刮得乱叫，眼前出现了乱哄哄的景象。当他走近猪栏，几头老母猪带着一群小猪向他扑来。他吓得猛一转身，却掉到一个菜窖里。醒来才知道是在作梦。但怎么也睡不着了。他边穿衣边琢磨：是呀，把菜放到窖里就不怕冻了，挖一个菜窖要比盖一间房舍省工省料得多，如果把猪弄到地窖里喂，不是很好吗？他急忙返回猪场，这时正是午夜一时。他在猪场比划来，比划去，天还没亮，一幅地下猪舍图就绘成了。管理区领导上看了他的设计都说好，既能保温，又不费材料，积极支持他。接着，他和大家一起苦干了两天两夜，兴建了五间地下猪舍。这年冬天，共挖了四十多间地下猪舍，使全场瘦弱猪、母猪和小猪，安全度过了严冬。这种地下猪舍，受到了吉林省广大干部和社员的好评，一直有人前来参观学习。
    养猪场建立不久，就有一批瘦弱猪进场。管理区把这批猪买进来时，不少人都认为没法喂好，但刘清才却自动领去了十五头皮包骨的母猪。这一下他更忙了，他日夜研究每头猪的习性、特点。有一次，一头猪一天没有吃食，他担心是否病了；可是第二天又恢复正常。他一连观察了好几天，才弄清原来是头“抢食猪”，一顿饱一顿饥，吃的过饱了，下顿当然就不爱吃了。于是他采用了定食定量法，让每头猪吃食均匀，问题便解决了。就这样，他把每头猪的习性摸得烂熟。经过一个多月的饲养，这些瘦猪不但没死，还渐渐的肥起来。
    有人说刘清才像本养猪的活字典，真是不假。哪头猪怀孕了，哪头猪什么时候下崽，他都了如指掌。只要是有猪下崽，不管白天黑夜，雨雪无阻，他都要到场接生，常常整夜不得合眼。去年11月末，一头只有十二个奶头的母猪下了十九头小猪。母猪的奶不够小猪吃，急得他什么似的。恰巧第二天有一头母猪只下五头小猪。于是他想：将小猪分几个给这头母猪喂奶，不就解决问题了吗？可是，当他把那些小猪放在这只母猪身边，母猪混身上下嗅了一嗅之后，却张开嘴巴咬起来了。他急忙将小猪抱回来。可是这一来，刘清才却悟出道理来了，他想：大概母猪嗅觉较敏锐，可以判别是不是自己生的小猪，他便试用那只猪的胎盘擦抹小猪，果然，母猪就让小猪吃奶了。但是，一个胎盘擦不了几个小猪，他又想出用母猪尿洗小猪的办法，也收到同样的效果。刘清才在饲养当中，还注意研究母猪乳腺的分布，他发现正中间那两个奶头的奶汁比一般多，于是他就根据小猪不乱吃奶头的习性，将比较弱的小猪定在奶汁多的奶头上。因此，经他手喂的小猪，个个健壮。
    刘清才在工作中不仅埋头苦干，还注意钻研养猪的科学知识。自建场以来，他饲养的猪从没发生过瘟疫，母猪达到了全配、全怀、全产、全活，仔猪达到了全壮。
