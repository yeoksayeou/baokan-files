Happily Seeing Recovery Surpass Pre-Disaster Conditions
　　—An Investigation of the Liaobu Commune
　　By our staff reporter, Wang Zhenhua

　　In June of this year, several dozen people's communes in four counties in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River in Guangdong suffered from an extraordinary flood disaster. Could the people's communes in the disaster area stand firm in the face of such a major disaster? Could they quickly restore production and rebuild their homes? This became a question of great concern to everyone. To answer these questions, we conducted an investigation in the Liaobu Commune in Dongguan County, a severely affected area in the Dongjiang River.

　　A Miracle on Earth

　　Liaobu Commune is located in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River and used to be a disaster-prone area. Before liberation, large areas of land were either flooded or drought-stricken every year, resulting in no harvest. Due to the poor foundation of the original water conservancy construction, water and drought disasters could not be completely avoided even after several years of water management struggles after liberation. A flood of this magnitude, like this year's, was irresistible under the current conditions. Even the elderly people who had suffered from floods before liberation had never heard their ancestors mention such a large flood. This flood swept through seventeen production brigades in the plains area of Liaobu Commune and Liaobu Town overnight, with the water rising more than ten feet high. Although all 25,223 disaster victims were rescued under the strong leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the commune's production and the lives of the commune members were severely damaged. The area of rice fields flooded in the entire commune was 30,036 mu, accounting for 52% of the total area of early rice fields; 3,966 mu of economic crops and 1,072 mu of fish ponds were flooded and lost; 3,106 houses collapsed; 57 factory buildings and a large pottery kiln of the main factories run by the commune were washed away by the flood, and other things such as agricultural tools, livestock, furniture, and supplies were greatly damaged. The flood submerged large areas of Liaobu Commune for more than 20 days. At that time, people said: How long will it take to recover?

　　Who would have thought that a miraculous victory would occur in just over five months? The commune members of Liaobu Commune won an unprecedented bumper harvest of late rice. The total yield of rice from the 64,000 mu of rice fields in the entire commune reached 38.4 million jin, with an average yield of 600 jin per mu, an increase of 14,253,500 jin of rice compared with the late rice harvest of 1958 during the Great Leap Forward. This year, they also planted 14,122 mu of autumn sweet potatoes in the late season. In this way, the total grain output of the commune this year can reach 47,226,000 jin, an increase of 3,173,000 jin compared with the total grain output of 44,053,000 jin in 1958. This means that the commune members of Liaobu Commune have fulfilled their bold slogan of "seizing a year's grain in one season" as they wished. Now, the commune has sold 10,008,500 jin of surplus grain to the state, and has retained enough grain for the commune members' rations, seed grain for next year, feed grain, and 1.2 million jin of reserve grain.

　　The flood took away the homes passed down from their ancestors, but today, five months later, there are new houses and new villages everywhere. Han Tou Village, which was completely destroyed by the flood, has now disappeared. Instead, it is replaced by a new village consisting of two long rows of brand-new buildings. Fifty-nine of the sixty-two households in this village have already moved into their new homes, and the new homes of the remaining three households have also begun to be roofed and decorated, and will be completed soon. All these new houses are more than 20 square meters wide, with two floors that can be lived in, and there is also a small attached building in the back that can be used as a kitchen or to raise pigs and chickens. According to statistics, this commune repaired a total of 1,276 houses and built 1,010 new houses in the five months after the disaster.

　　In the five months after the disaster, Liaobu Commune also made great efforts to fully restore and develop industrial production and animal husbandry and sideline occupations.

　　After the flood, they not only repaired the 57 factory buildings and a large pottery kiln that collapsed in the flood in a very short time and quickly restored production, but also greatly expanded these original factories. The commune added ten factory buildings to the original nine major industrial projects. In addition, three new commune-run factories were added. The new industrial projects added by the commune also include digging white mud, mining sulfur ore and green alum ore, digging water pine roots, and expanding various industries of the commune farm. Up to now, the income from these commune-run industries has increased by 222,000 yuan. More than 130 large and small factories and units have been developed by various production brigades after the disaster. Animal husbandry production has also been fully restored to the pre-disaster level within two months after the disaster. Up to now, the communes and brigades have raised a total of 20,349 pigs, an increase of 68% compared with the 12,082 heads before the disaster; the number of three kinds of fowl (chickens, ducks, and geese) has increased by 4.6 times compared with before the disaster. After the disaster, the commune further expanded the planting area of economic crops. They extracted 164 people to form a professional team, combined with mass short-term attacks, and planted a total of 13,900 mu of pineapples, citrus, lychees, crow-wing trees, bamboo forests, oil tea, and tung trees. In addition, they also organized commune members of various brigades to carry out short-term sideline production, which was also very effective.

　　As a result of the comprehensive restoration and development of production in Liaobu Commune, from July to the end of October after the disaster, the total income was 1,282,000 yuan. Commune members have received wages and pocket money. The sideline production of commune members' families also has a considerable income. Many disaster-stricken commune members have successively added new winter clothes and some furniture and supplies. Yin Qunxiang, a commune member of Xixi Village, said that after the flood, her family has added a cotton mattress, a bed sheet, and made four new clothes. The lost furniture and supplies have also gradually been added back. Now, there are also 225,000 yuan of private deposits from commune members in the commune's credit cooperative. During this period, the public accumulation of the commune also increased from 416,000 yuan before the disaster to more than 1.3 million yuan recently.

　　Isn't all this a miracle on earth?

　　The Origin of the Miracle

　　Everywhere in all the disaster-stricken brigades of Liaobu Commune, one can hear such words: "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, let alone having such a good life today, even if we were lucky enough not to be drowned by the flood, we would have starved to death after the flood!" Indeed, these are the heartfelt words of the commune members. In the days when the flood had just receded, many commune members had no confidence in overcoming the disaster. They used to sit on the ruins and cry, spending these days with a heavy heart. But at this moment, the commune Party committee immediately sent the 180,000 jin of relief rice, 75,000 yuan of living relief funds, and various relief materials allocated by the government to the commune members. At the same time, it put forward the slogan of "restore production, rebuild our homes, and strive to become stronger" among all commune members. All Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members took the lead in picking up hoes and ploughs and went to the fields. All this made all the commune members see new hope. They stood up from the rubble and, together with the Communist Party members, plunged into the battle to restore production with great enthusiasm.

　　The superiority of the "large-scale and public" nature of the people's commune is particularly prominent in the disaster area. When the rice fields of the seventeen severely affected brigades of Liaobu Commune were still a vast expanse of water, those mountain brigades that were not affected or were not severely affected helped the commune members in the severely affected areas to start preparing for the restoration of production. At that time, the most worrying thing was that most of the late rice seedlings in the disaster area were drowned. If they were not replanted immediately, the late rice production would be delayed. However, the fields of these brigades were still soaked in water and it was unknown when they would be able to recede, and they did not have any grain seeds on hand. Under the unified leadership of the commune, the various brigades in the mountainous areas took the initiative to take out 147,000 jin of fine seeds prepared for their own use, selected good fields, and sowed the seeds of late rice for the commune members in the disaster area. When the flood began to recede, in order to help the people in the disaster area realize the slogan of "retreating an inch, rushing to plant an inch; retreating wherever the water goes, rushing to plant wherever it goes," many brigades in the mountainous areas transferred a large number of laborers, carrying their own grain, livestock, and agricultural tools, to help the commune members in the disaster area to start plowing and rush to plant late rice earlier, during the busy season of summer harvesting and summer planting. It was precisely because the commune organized this kind of large-scale cooperation between disaster areas and non-disaster areas, which was difficult to do during the period of advanced cooperatives, that the entire disaster area completed transplanting rice more than a season earlier than last year's late rice, laying a good foundation for the bumper harvest of "seizing a year's grain in one season."

　　The commune's all-out economy played a very significant role in helping the various brigades after the disaster. After the disaster, the commune allocated 25,000 yuan from the income of the commune-run enterprises to support the disaster area to restore production. In order to supplement the agricultural tools destroyed after the disaster, the commune expanded the original agricultural machinery factory and built a new agricultural machinery factory. In the five months after the disaster, it timely supplied the various brigades in the disaster area with more than 30,000 large and small agricultural tools. In order to help the commune members rebuild their homes, the commune built five new brick and tile factories, and helped eleven brigade brick and tile factories that had stopped production before the flood to resume production, and built two new lime kilns and eleven shell ash kilns to produce a large number of bricks, tiles, and lime.

　　The commune members of Liaobu Commune, under the strong leadership of the Party, overcame numerous difficulties with such heroic spirit. According to the commune Party committee's rough calculation, if it were according to the past situation, the 24,600 laborers of the commune would have to work for at least one and a half years to complete all the work completed in the five months after the disaster. However, now they work hard and skillfully, and only took five months to complete such a large amount of work. When the commune members excitedly talked about these things, they always said: In order to recover the losses from the disaster, who wouldn't want to use one day as two days and do the work of two people?

　　喜见灾后胜灾前
　　——寮步公社的调查
  　本报记者　汪振华
    今年6月间，广东东江下游四个县几十个人民公社遭受了特大洪水灾害。灾区的人民公社能否在大灾大难面前站得住脚？能否迅速恢复生产，重建家园？这就成为一个大家瞩目的问题。我们为了回答这些问题，在东江重灾区东莞县寮步公社进行了调查。
    人间的奇迹
    寮步公社在东江下游，过去是一个多灾多难的地方。解放前，每年都有大片土地不是受淹就是受旱，得不到收成。由于原来的水利建设基础太差，解放以后经过几年的治水斗争，水旱灾害仍然无法完全避免，像今年这样的特大洪水，是在目前条件下无法抗拒的。连那些在解放前饱受水灾之苦的老人，也从来没有听他们的祖辈提到曾经有过这样大的水灾。这一场洪水，在一夜之间，席卷寮步公社平原地区十七个生产大队和寮步镇，水涨一丈多高。虽然在各级党委的坚强领导下，救出了全部二万五千二百二十三个灾民，但是，公社的生产和社员的生活都受到了巨大的破坏。全公社受淹的稻田面积三万零三十六亩，占早造稻田总面积的52％；受淹失收的经济作物三千九百六十六亩，鱼塘一千零七十二亩；倒塌房屋三千一百零六间；公社办的主要工厂，有五十七间厂房和一座大陶窑被洪水冲倒，其他如农具、牲畜、家具、用品等都受到极大损失。洪水淹没寮步公社大片土地达二十多天。那时候，人们说：需要多少时间才能恢复元气啊！
    谁能想到，只隔五个多月的时间，奇迹式的胜利出现了。寮步公社的社员夺得了晚造空前大丰收，全公社六万四千亩稻田总共收得稻谷三千八百四十万斤，平均亩产达到六百斤，比大跃进的1958年晚造，多收稻谷一千四百二十五万三千五百斤。今年晚造，他们还种了一万四千一百二十二亩秋番薯。这样，公社今年的粮食总产量可以达到四千七百二十二万六千斤，比1958年全年粮食总产量四千四百零五万三千斤，还多出三百一十七万三千斤。这就是说，寮步公社的社员，如愿以偿地实现了“一造夺取一年粮”的豪迈口号。现在，公社已经卖给国家一千万零八千五百斤余粮，留足了社员的口粮和明年的种子粮、饲料粮，还有一百二十万斤储备粮。
    洪水夺去了祖辈相传的家园，可是，五个月后的今天，就已经处处是新房，处处是新村。全部毁于洪水的涵头村，现在废墟不见了，代替它的是两长列崭新的楼房构成的新村。这个村子的六十二户人家，已经有五十九户搬进了新居，其余三户人家的新房，也已经开始盖瓦粉饰，不久以后就可以落成。所有这些新房子，每一间都有二十多平方米宽，上下两层都可以住人，后面还有一个小小的附属建筑，可以做厨房，也可以用来养猪、养鸡。据统计，这个公社在灾后的五个月内，一共修好了一千二百七十六间房屋，新建了一千零一十间新房。
    寮步公社在灾后五个多月的时间里，还在全面恢复和发展工业生产和牧、副业方面，作了巨大的努力。
    水灾过后，他们不仅用很短的时间就修复了在水灾中倒塌的五十七间厂房、一座大陶窑，迅速恢复了生产，而且把这些原有的工厂大大地扩充起来。公社原有的九个主要工业项目，增建了十间厂房。另外，还新增加了三间社办工厂。公社新增加的工业项目，还有挖白坭，开硫磺矿、青矾矿，挖水松根和扩大公社农场各项工业等。到目前为止，这些社办工业增加的收入达到二十二万二千元。各个生产大队在受灾以后发展起来的大小工厂单位共一百三十多间。畜牧业生产也在受灾以后的两个月内全面恢复到了灾前的水平。到目前为止，公社各大队共养猪二万零三百四十九头，比受灾前的一万二千零八十二头，增加了68％；三鸟（鸡鸭鹅）比受灾前增加了四点六倍。公社在受灾以后，还进一步扩大了经济作物的种植面积。他们抽出一百六十四人组成专业队伍，结合群众性的短期突击，种下了菠萝、柑桔、荔枝、乌杬、竹林、油茶、油桐等共一万三千九百亩。此外，还组织各大队社员进行了短期的副业生产，收效也很大。
    寮步公社全面恢复和发展生产的结果，从受灾以后的7月份起，到10月底为止，总收入一百二十八万二千元。社员都领到了工资，有了零用钱。社员家庭副业生产，还有一笔数目可观的收入。许多受灾的社员，都陆续添置了冬季新衣和部分家具、用品。西溪村社员尹群香说，水灾以后，她家里已经添置了一张棉胎，一张被单，还做了四件新衣服，损失的家具用品，也渐渐添置回来了。现在，公社的信用部里，还有社员私人存款二十二万五千元。在这期间，公社的公共积累也从受灾以前的四十一万六千元，增加到最近的一百三十多万元。
    所有这一切，不是人间的奇迹么？
    奇迹的由来
    人们在寮步公社所有受灾的大队，到处都可以听到这样的话：“要不是有了共产党领导，别说有今天这样好的日子过，即使万幸没有被大水淹死，也会在洪水过后被饿死啊！”确实，这是社员们的肺腑之言。在洪水刚退的日子里，不少社员是没有信心战胜灾害的。他们曾经坐在废墟上痛哭，用沉痛的心情打发这些日子。但是，就在这个时候，公社党委立即把政府拨来的十八万斤救济米、七万五千元生活救济款和各种救济物资，送到社员的手上。同时，在全体社员中提出了“恢复生产，重建家园，发奋图强”的号召。所有的共产党员和共青团员，带头拿起锄头和犁耙，到田野上去了。这一切，使所有的社员看到了新的希望，他们从瓦砾堆上站起来，跟着共产党员一起，干劲冲天地投入了恢复生产的战斗。
    人民公社的“一大二公”的优越性，在灾区是表现得特别突出的。当寮步公社十七个重灾大队的稻田还是一片汪洋的时候，那些没有受灾和受灾不大的山区大队，就帮助重灾区的社员开始了恢复生产的准备工作。那时候，最使人心焦的是，灾区的晚造秧苗大部分被淹死了，要是不马上重新播种，晚造生产就要违误农时。但是，这些大队的田还被大水浸着，不知什么时候才能退出，而且手上又没有谷种。在公社统一领导下，山区的各个大队主动地拿出准备自己用的十四万七千斤良种，选出好田，给灾区的社员播下了晚造的种子。洪水开始消退时，为了帮助灾区人民实现“水退一寸，抢种一寸；水退到哪里，抢种到哪里”的口号，许多山区大队都在夏收夏种大忙的季节，抽调大批劳动力，带着自己的粮食、耕畜和农具，帮助灾区社员提早开耕，抢种晚稻。正是由于公社组织了这种在高级社时期难于办到的灾区与非灾区的大协作，就使整个灾区比去年晚造提早一个多季节插完秧，为“一造夺取一年粮”的大丰收打下了良好的基础。
    公社所有的经济，在灾后帮助各大队中显示了非常显著的作用。受灾以后，公社便从社办企业收入中拨出二万五千元，支援灾区恢复生产。为添补受灾后破坏的农具，公社扩充了原有的农械厂，又新建一间农械厂，在灾后五个月的时间内，及时地供应了灾区各大队大小三万多件农具。公社为了帮助社员重建家园，一共新建了五间砖瓦厂，又帮助十一间水灾以前就已经停止生产的大队砖瓦厂恢复了生产，新建了石灰窑两座、壳灰窑十一座，生产大量砖、瓦和石灰。
    在党的坚强的领导下的寮步公社的社员们，用多么英雄的气概，战胜了重重的困难。据公社党委的粗略的计算，如果按照过去的情况，公社的二万四千六百个劳动力，要完成受灾以后五个多月所完成的全部工作，起码要干一年半左右的时间。但是，现在他们苦干加巧干，只用了五个多月的时间，就完成了这样大的工作量。社员们兴奋地谈到这些事情的时候，总是说：为了夺回受灾的损失，谁不愿意一天当作两天用，一个人干两个人的事呢？（附图片）
