Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 4th. The Chinese Silicate Society held its inaugural meeting in Shanghai at the end of November.

More than 360 representatives from 156 units, including central and provincial/municipal departments, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and its provincial/municipal branches, silicate scientific research units, universities, and industrial and mining enterprises from all over the country, attended the inaugural meeting. At the meeting, directors of the Chinese Silicate Society were elected, and a board of directors was established.

The silicate industry includes cement, concrete, refractory materials, silicate components, glass, ceramics, etc., covering a wide range. Therefore, the development of the silicate industry is of great significance to the daily life of the broad masses of the people, the national economic construction, and even the development of cutting-edge science and technology. During the preparatory period of the Chinese Silicate Society, ten provinces and cities across the country successively established preparatory branches or groups, carried out academic activities, and gradually launched scientific research work on silicates nationwide. At this inaugural meeting, research units, universities, and factories and mines submitted a total of 172 research papers and reports, with substantial content.

The meeting proposed that the future work of the National Silicate Society and silicate scientific research should be: to continue to implement the policy of orienting research work towards production and linking it with practice, so as to make greater contributions to the development of the silicate industry and the improvement of the level of silicate science. During the meeting, many units signed cooperation and mutual assistance contracts.

    中国硅酸盐学会成立
    据新华社上海4日电　中国硅酸盐学会11月底在上海举行成立大会。
    出席成立大会的有中央及省市有关部门、中国科学院及中国科学院省市分院的代表，来自全国各地硅酸盐科学研究单位、高等院校、工矿企业等一百五十六个单位的代表共三百六十多人。会上，选出了中国硅酸盐学会的理事，成立了理事会。
    硅酸盐工业包括水泥、混凝土、耐火材料、硅酸盐构件、玻璃、陶瓷等，涉及的面很广。因此，发展硅酸盐工业无论对广大人民的日常生活或国家经济建设，乃至发展尖端科学技术都有着非常重要的意义。在中国硅酸盐学会筹备期间，全国有十个省市都相继成立筹备分会或小组，开展学术活动，逐步在全国范围内开展了硅酸盐方面的科学研究工作。这次成立大会上，各研究单位、高等学校和厂矿企业共提出一百七十二篇研究论文和报告，内容相当丰富。
    会议提出了全国硅酸盐学会及硅酸盐科学研究今后工作是：继续贯彻研究工作面向生产、联系实际的方针，为发展硅酸盐工业、提高硅酸盐科学水平作出更大贡献。会议期间，很多单位签订了协作互助合同。
