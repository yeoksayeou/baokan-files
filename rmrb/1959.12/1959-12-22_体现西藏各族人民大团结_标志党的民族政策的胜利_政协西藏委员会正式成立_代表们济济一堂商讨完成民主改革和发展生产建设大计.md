Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 21st: The first session of the First Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Tibet Committee grandly opened in Lhasa on the 20th, and the formal establishment of the CPPCC Tibet Committee was announced. One hundred and thirty-four members from all regions, ethnic groups, and sectors of Tibet will jointly consult and discuss important current and future work in Tibet, as well as the future tasks of the CPPCC Tibet Committee.

The opening ceremony of this meeting was held on the morning of the 20th in the newly completed auditorium of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, and executive chairman of the meeting, delivered the opening speech. He said: The CPPCC Tibet Committee is composed of patriotic and progressive people from all regions, ethnic groups, sectors, and classes in Tibet. This meeting has been in preparation for a long time and has been fully consulted with all parties. The meeting itself embodies the unprecedented unity of all ethnic groups in Tibet, and also marks the further consolidation and development of the people's democratic united front in Tibet. This meeting is a major event in the political life of all ethnic groups in Tibet and is another glorious victory for the great ethnic policies of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

Tan Guansan said: "This meeting will further discuss and consult on relevant policies for democratic reform in Tibet and various production and construction undertakings. Through this meeting, we must more broadly mobilize people from all walks of life in Tibet, under the leadership of the Party and the government, to give play to positive factors, and work hard to better and faster complete the democratic reform in Tibet and vigorously develop agricultural and animal husbandry production."

Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government and Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, was invited to speak at the meeting. He spoke about the great victories achieved in all aspects of work since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. He pointed out that these victories are the glorious victory of the Party's ethnic policies in Tibet.

Zhang Jingwu said: "Chairman Mao said: 'The unification of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic groups in the country are the basic guarantees for the inevitable victory of our cause.' The great victories achieved in our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction prove that this instruction is completely correct. Tibet is an inseparable part of the great motherland, and it has a bright and promising future. Tibet has hardworking and brave people and abundant resources. It has superior conditions for developing Tibet's industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, etc., and will undoubtedly play an important role in supporting the socialist construction of the motherland. However, only under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, firmly united in the big family of the great socialist motherland, can Tibet have sufficient manpower, material resources, financial resources, and modern scientific and technological strength for construction; only by completing democratic reform and following the socialist road can we change the long-term stagnation, poverty, and backwardness of Tibet's economy and culture, and enable the Tibetan nationality to join the ranks of advanced nationalities. Now the people of Tibet are moving forward in this correct and bright direction."

He said: "With the development of democratic reform in Tibet, the CPPCC Tibet Committee will play an important role in future political life. Now the people's democratic united front in Tibet is not shrinking compared with the past anti-imperialist and patriotic united front, but is expanding even further." Zhang Jingwu pointed out that continuing to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, strengthening political consultation, and actively assisting the people's government in completing democratic reform and developing production and construction undertakings are important tasks of the Tibet CPPCC. After the establishment of the Tibet CPPCC Committee, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, it will surely be able to make glorious contributions to further consolidating the unity of the motherland, strengthening national unity, and building a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

Apei Awang Jinmei, Vice Chairman of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, also spoke. He said: "Under the care of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Tibet Committee, which the people of all walks of life in Tibet have been looking forward to for a long time, is formally born today. This is a major event of historical significance, and it also marks another glorious and great victory of the Party's ethnic policies in the Tibet region!" He then pointed out that the representatives of the CPPCC Tibet Committee come from all directions. Its representation is the most extensive, and it will unite people from all classes and strata under the leadership of the Communist Party of China to play a greater active role in building a great socialist society.

At the meeting on the 20th, Zhang Guohua, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, also delivered a political report to the meeting on behalf of the CPC Tibet Working Committee. In the political report, Zhang Guohua analyzed the current international and domestic situation, and once again explained in detail the consistent policy of the Party and the government towards Tibet since its peaceful liberation, namely, the policy of national unity, ethnic equality, and gradually realizing national regional autonomy and gradually realizing democratic reform. He also explained the current situation in Tibet.

Zhang Guohua said: The characteristics of the current situation in Tibet are mainly: the ruling institutions of the feudal serf system have been completely destroyed; the millions of serfs who have stood up are exercising the right to be masters of their own affairs under the leadership of the Party and building their new lives; the vast number of staff members are also working with soaring enthusiasm, together with the masses, to victoriously and thoroughly realize democratic reform, and are working hard to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet. Among the upper-class figures, more and more people are in favor of democratic reform and support the central government. In the areas where democratic reform has been carried out, there is a thriving scene of peaceful construction everywhere. The situation in Tibet is very good.

The report talked about the central tasks of the Tibet region in 1960, which are to continue to implement democratic reform and actively develop agricultural and animal husbandry production, etc. The report also explained some of the main measures for democratic reform and development of production.

The report finally talked about the tasks of the CPPCC Tibet Committee during the period of democratic reform in Tibet, and clarified the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming upper-class figures. The report said: "The Party has always adopted a policy of uniting, educating, and transforming upper-class figures in Tibet, that is, a policy of long-term unity and long-term cooperation. As long as the upper-class figures in Tibet accept the Party's policies, support the central government, support democratic reform, stand on the people's position, and take the socialist road together with the people, they will surely have a way out." The report said: "We must give full play to the role of political consultation, consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, mobilize all positive factors, and serve the current democratic reform and future socialist construction in Tibet. The establishment of the CPPCC Tibet Committee provides extremely convenient conditions for giving full play to the role of political consultation organizationally."

Zhang Chengw, Director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Tibet Working Committee and Secretary-General of the First Session of the First Committee of the CPPCC Tibet Committee, delivered a report to the meeting on the work of the Tibet CPPCC Preparatory Committee. He said that the nomination of members of the Tibet CPPCC was repeatedly consulted with the CPC committees, governments, and relevant representatives in various regions, and a list of members from all aspects was proposed, and a preparatory meeting for the first session of the First Committee of the CPPCC Tibet Committee was held on the 19th of this month. In the nomination of members, we have tried our best to take care of all regions, all circles, and all factions in the religious circles, as well as other ethnic minorities in Tibet, and have paid special attention to upper-class figures and religious circles. These two circles accounted for 52% of the total number of members, and farmers and herdsmen members accounted for 10%.

Also participating in the meeting on the 20th were a total of 215 nonvoting delegates from all ethnic groups, all sectors, and all regions.

The meeting will continue.

　　体现西藏各族人民大团结　标志党的民族政策的胜利
    政协西藏委员会正式成立
    代表们济济一堂商讨完成民主改革和发展生产建设大计
    新华社拉萨21日电　中国人民政治协商会议西藏委员会第一届第一次全体会议，20日在拉萨隆重开幕，并宣告政协西藏委员会正式成立。来自西藏各地区各族各界的一百三十四名委员，将在这次会议上共同协商、讨论西藏当前和今后的重要工作，以及政协西藏委员会今后的任务。
    这次会议的开幕仪式20日上午在西藏自治区筹备委员会新近落成的礼堂里举行。中共西藏工委副书记、西藏军区政治委员、会议的执行主席谭冠三致开幕词。他说：政协西藏委员会是由包括西藏各地区、各民族、各界、各阶层的爱国进步人士组成的。这次会议在召开前曾经进行了长期筹备，并和各方面进行了充分的协商。会议本身就体现了西藏各民族的空前大团结，也标志着西藏人民民主统一战线的进一步巩固与发展。这次会议是西藏各族人民政治生活中的一件大事，是中国共产党和毛主席伟大民族政策又一次的光辉胜利。
    谭冠三说：“这次会议要进一步讨论、协商西藏民主改革的有关政策和各项生产建设事业。通过这次会议，要更广泛地动员西藏各阶层人民，在党和政府的领导下，发挥积极因素，为更好、更快地彻底完成西藏地区的民主改革和大力发展农牧业生产而努力工作。”
    中央人民政府代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武应邀在会上讲话。他谈到了西藏和平解放以来各方面工作中所取得的伟大胜利。他指出，这些胜利是党的民族政策在西藏的光辉胜利。
    张经武说：“毛主席说过：‘国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定胜利的基本保证。’我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业取得了伟大的胜利，证明这一指示是完全正确的。西藏是伟大祖国不可分割的一部分，它具有光明远大的发展前途。西藏有勤劳、勇敢的人民和丰富的资源，对于发展西藏的工业、农业、牧业等都有优越的条件，对于支援祖国的社会主义建设，无疑地也将起重要的作用。但是，只有在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，巩固地团结在伟大社会主义祖国的大家庭中，西藏才能够有足够的人力、物力、财力和现代科学技术力量进行建设；只有完成民主改革和走社会主义道路，才能够改变西藏经济、文化长期停滞不前、贫困落后的状态，也才能够使西藏藏族跻于先进民族的行列。现在西藏人民正在朝着这个正确光明的方向前进。”
    他说：“随着西藏民主改革工作的发展，政协西藏委员会在今后的政治生活中将发挥它的重要作用。现在西藏地方的人民民主统一战线，比过去的反帝爱国统一战线不是缩小了，而是更加扩大了。”张经武指出，继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，加强政治协商工作，积极协助人民政府完成民主改革和发展生产建设事业，这是西藏政协的重要任务。西藏政协委员会成立之后，在中国共产党的领导下，对于进一步巩固祖国的统一和加强民族的团结，建设民主和社会主义的新西藏，一定能够作出光荣的贡献。
    政协第二届全国委员会副主席、西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美也讲了话。他说：“在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的关怀下，我们西藏各阶层人民盼望已久的中国人民政治协商会议西藏委员会今天正式诞生了。这是一件具有历史意义的大喜事，也标志着党的民族政策在西藏地区又一次光辉的伟大胜利！”他接着指出，政协西藏委员会的代表来自四面八方。它的代表性是最广泛的，它将使各阶级各阶层人士在中国共产党的领导下团结起来，为建设伟大的社会主义社会发挥更大的积极作用。
    20日的会议还听取了中共西藏工委副书记张国华代表中共西藏工委向会议所作的政治报告。张国华在政治报告中分析了目前国际、国内的形势，并且再一次详细说明了西藏和平解放以后，党和政府对西藏一贯坚持执行的祖国统一、民族团结、平等的政策，和逐步实现民族区域自治、逐步实现民主改革的政策。他又说明了西藏目前的形势。
    张国华说：当前西藏形势的特点主要是：彻底摧毁了封建农奴制度的统治机构；站起来了的百万农奴，正以主人翁的姿态在党的领导下行使着当家作主的权利，建设着自己的新生活；广大工作人员也正以冲天的干劲，和群众一起胜利地彻底实现着民主改革，并且正在为建设民主的、社会主义的新西藏而努力工作。在上层人士中赞成民主改革和拥护中央的人也越来越多。在已经开展民主改革的地区，到处呈现着一片欣欣向荣的和平建设景象。西藏的形势很好。
    报告谈到了西藏地区1960年的中心任务是继续实行民主改革，积极发展农牧业生产等。报告中还对民主改革和发展生产的一些主要措施作了说明。
    报告最后谈到了政协西藏委员会在西藏民主改革期间的任务，阐明了党对上层人士的团结、教育和改造的方针。报告说：“党对西藏上层人士一贯采取团结、教育和改造的方针，也就是长期团结和长期合作的方针。只要西藏上层人士接受党的政策，拥护中央，拥护民主改革，站在人民的立场上，和人民一道走社会主义道路，他们就一定是有出路。”报告说：“我们必须充分发挥政治协商的作用，巩固与扩大人民民主统一战线，调动一切积极因素，为西藏当前的民主改革和将来的社会主义建设事业服务。政协西藏委员会的成立就在组织上为充分发挥政治协商作用带来了极为便利的条件。”
    中共西藏工委统一战线工作部部长、政协西藏委员会第一届第一次会议秘书长张承武，向会议作了关于西藏政协筹备委员会工作的报告。他说，对西藏政协委员的提名，先后经过和各地区的中共党委、政府和有关代表人士反复协商，提出了各方面的委员名单，并在本月19日举行了政协西藏委员会第一届第一次会议的预备会议。在委员的提名中尽量照顾到各地区、各界和宗教界的各派别以及西藏其他少数民族，特别照顾了上层人士和宗教界，这两界的委员占委员总人数的52％，农牧民委员占10％。
    参加20日会议的，还有各族、各界、各地区的列席代表共二百一十五人。
    会议将继续举行。
