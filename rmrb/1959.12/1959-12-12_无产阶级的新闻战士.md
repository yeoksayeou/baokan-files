　　"Look, we've talked all night again, the morning glow is already out!"
　　"Perhaps this morning glow heralds the arrival of a new era for humanity!"
　　This is a dialogue from the excellent Soviet film "In the Days of October" that was released not long ago. The person who said the latter sentence was an American reporter who passionately praised the October Revolution. He aroused great interest and respect from the audience. This eyewitness and participant of the October Uprising was the famous American Communist journalist and writer John Reed.
　　John Reed was born into the home of a pioneer. From his father, he inherited the revolutionary spirit of resisting powerful forces. At school, he clashed daily with the children of the wealthy and privileged classes. In the stronghold of financial oligarchs, Harvard, he organized a socialist club to combat the preachings of those capitalist orthodox teachers. When he stepped out of school, his talent attracted many newspapers and periodicals to invite him to write articles and commentaries on important events abroad. Thus, he made many unusual trips.
　　He participated in the strike of the Paterson silk workers; he mingled with the insurgents in Colorado who refused to be Rockefeller's cannon fodder; in Mexico, he marched shoulder to shoulder with the peasants who opposed enslavement. After the outbreak of the First World War, he ran to Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, the Balkans, and even Russia.
　　He wandered through many countries and all the front lines, directly participating in various resistance struggles. After returning to New York, he continued to use his sharp pen to expose the old system.
　　He wrote "Insurgent Mexico" in lyrical style, praising the glorious and arduous struggle of the farmers and herdsmen against the ruthless exploitation of landlords and the Catholic Church. He told people that "there is indeed rebellion and chaos in Mexico, but those responsible for all this are not the landless peasants, but those who sow turmoil by transporting gold and weapons, namely, the competing British and American oil companies."
　　After returning from the battlefield, he published an article in "The Liberator" magazine, violently attacking militarism and cursing the cruel massacre organized by these mutually hostile imperialists, and was therefore prosecuted by the New York court for treason. In court, Reed bravely declared that he considered it his duty to fight for the socialist revolution under the banner of revolution. The prosecutor then asked him a question:
　　"But in the current war, are you fighting under the flag of the United States?" Reed's answer was firm: "No!" He delivered a passionate speech in court, vividly describing the tragic situation he had witnessed on the battlefield. In the end, the helpless judge had no choice but to acquit him.
　　In the summer of 1917, he rushed to Russia before dawn, in order to "let American readers understand the Russian revolution." The wise, decisive, and flexible leadership of the Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin and its Central Committee in the October Revolution, as well as the heroism and revolutionary creativity of the uprising people, inspired John Reed. He himself enthusiastically participated in this great uprising, which we can see in the film. With the keen eyes of a passionate revolutionary and a talented artist, he discerned the essence of the revolutionary events before him, understood the far-reaching historical significance of the revolutionary events, and in 1919 completed the world's first work that declared to mankind the beginning of a new era in human history, the October Socialist Revolution, "Ten Days That Shook the World." Lenin gave a very high evaluation of this book and wrote a preface for its American edition. Lenin said: "I read John Reed's 'Ten Days That Shook the World' with great interest and unremitting attention. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to workers in all countries. I hope that this book will be published in millions of copies and translated into various languages, because it provides a true and exceptionally vivid description of those events that are of extreme importance for understanding what the proletarian revolution is and what the proletarian dictatorship is. … John Reed's book undoubtedly helps to clarify this issue, which is the fundamental issue in the world's workers' movement."
　　The United States and other imperialist elements had attempted to confiscate the materials collected by John Reed and tried to steal the manuscript from the publisher six times. However, by 1919, the book had already been printed in three editions in the United States. He successively served as the editor of the left-wing socialist magazines "Revolutionary Age," "The Communist," and "The Voice of Labor," and constantly wrote articles in "The Liberator," traveled to various parts of the United States, and participated in various mass activities. He used his own mouth and hands to promote socialism, lash out at those bourgeois who enslaved the people; and used his revolutionary enthusiasm to infect and inspire the people's fighting spirit. In the short life in which the spark of his life burst forth, he was arrested and imprisoned by the rulers more than twenty times, but he never stopped his revolutionary activities for a minute.
　　In 1919, he returned to the Soviet Union again. On October 17, 1920, he died of typhoid fever in Moscow and was buried in Red Square in Moscow. As N.K. Krupskaya said in the preface to the Russian edition: "John Reed linked himself entirely with the Russian revolution, and Soviet Russia was dear to him. … Comrades like John Reed deserve this glory."

    无产阶级的新闻战士
  　吴边
    “你看我们俩又谈了整夜，早霞都出来了！”
    “也许这个早霞预报着人类的新纪元已经来临了！”
    这是不久前上映的苏联优秀影片“在十月的日子里”的一段对话。说后一句话的是一位热情讴歌十月革命的美国记者。他引起了观众的极大兴趣和尊敬。这位十月起义的目击者和参加者，就是著名的美国共产党员记者、作家约翰·里德。
    约翰·里德诞生在一个垦荒者的家里，从父亲那里继承了反抗强权势利的革命精神，在学校里，他每天都和那些有钱的和特权阶级的子弟发生冲突。他在哈佛这个金融寡头的堡垒中心组织了社会主义俱乐部，来打击那些资本主义的正统的教师们的说教。等他跨出校门，他的才能吸引了许多报刊约他撰写文章和国外生活重要事件的评论。于是他作了许多次的不平常的旅行。
    他参与了彼得逊纺织工人的罢工；他同科罗拉多拒绝作洛克菲勒炮灰的暴动者们打成了一片；在墨西哥，他和反对奴役的农民并肩前进。第一次世界大战爆发了以后，他又跑到了德国、法国、意大利、土耳其、巴尔干以至俄国。
    他漫游了许多国家和所有的战线，直接参加了各种反抗的斗争。在他回到纽约以后，继续运用犀利的笔，对旧制度进行揭露。
    他用抒情诗的笔调写了“革命的墨西哥”，歌颂农牧民对地主和天主教教会无情剥削的光荣而艰苦的斗争。他告诉人们“在墨西哥的确存在着暴动和混乱状态，但是，应当对这一切负责的不是无地的农民，而是那些由于运送黄金和武器因而种下骚乱的人，即互相竞争着的英美两国的石油公司。”
    他从战场回来，在“解放者”杂志上发表了一篇猛烈攻击军国主义的文章，诅咒这种相互敌对的帝国主义所组织的残酷屠杀，因此被纽约法院以叛国罪起诉。在法庭上，里德勇敢地宣称，他认为自己的义务是在革命的旗帜下为社会主义革命而斗争时，检察官向他提出了一个问题：
    “可是在现在的战争中，你是否在美国的国旗下作战呢？”里德的回答是坚定的“不”！他在法庭上发表了热情的演说，生动地描写了战场上亲眼所见的惨状。结果无可奈何的法官只好宣判他无罪。
    1917年夏天，他赶到黎明前的俄国。为的是“想让美国的读者了解俄国的革命”。以列宁为首的布尔什维克党及其中央委员会对十月革命的英明、果断灵活的领导，起义人民的英雄主义和革命的创造性鼓舞了约翰·里德。他自己也热情地参加了这一伟大的起义，这些我们从影片中就可以看到。他以自己的热情的革命者和有才能的艺术家的锐利的眼光，洞察了在他眼前的革命事变的本质，领会了革命事变的深远的历史意义，在1919年完成了世界上第一部向人类宣告开创了人类历史新纪元的十月社会主义革命实况的著作——“震撼世界的十天”。列宁对这书作了极高的评价，并为它的美国版写了序言。列宁说：“我以极大的兴趣和不懈的注意力读完了约翰·里德的‘震撼世界的十天’一书，我衷心地把这部著作推荐给各国工人。我希望这本书能发行千百万册，译成各种文字，因为它就那些对于理解什么是无产阶级革命什么是无产阶级专政具有极端重要意义的事件，作了真实的、异常生动的描述。……约翰·里德的这本书无疑有助于阐明这个问题，而这正是世界工人运动中的根本问题。”
    美国和其他帝国主义分子曾经试图没收约翰·里德所收集到的资料，六次打算从出版社偷走原稿。但是，到1919年，这本书在美国就已印行了三版。他先后作了左派社会主义者杂志“革命世纪”、“共产党人”杂志以及“劳动之声报”的编辑，不断地在“解放者”上写文章，到美国各地去游历，参加各种群众活动。用自己的嘴和手宣传社会主义，鞭挞那些奴役人民的资产阶级；用自己的革命热情来感染和鼓舞人民的斗争情绪。在他生命的火花迸发的短促的一生中，就被统治者逮捕和监禁过二十多次，可是他一分钟也没有停止过自己的革命活动。
    1919年他又回到苏联。1920年10月17日因伤寒病逝在莫斯科。被安葬在莫斯科红场。正如娜·克鲁普斯卡娅在俄文版序言中所说的：“约翰·里德把自己整个地同俄国革命联系在一起，苏维埃俄国对他说来是亲切的。……像约翰·里德这样的同志是应分得到这种光荣的。”
