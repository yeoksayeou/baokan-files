Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, has achieved brilliant results in agricultural production this year. The county's more than 440,000 mu of grain crops achieved an average yield of 519 jin per mu, an increase from last year's 404 jin, exceeding the grain yield target stipulated by the National Agricultural Development Program for areas south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River. The county's total grain output increased by 11.1% compared to last year.

Jiaohe County is located in a cold, mountainous region with a frost-free period of only 120 days. Before 1958, frost damage caused reduced yields year after year. Last year, by focusing on timely early planting and growing more high-yield crops as two basic measures for increasing production, they overcame the harm of early frost and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. In January of this year, when the Jiaohe County Party Committee summarized the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, it found that there was still a lot of potential for increasing production that had not been realized, and the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture was not fully implemented with regard to close planting. Therefore, it was decided that this year, while continuing to promote timely early planting, growing more high-yield crops, and other production-increasing measures, they would resolutely grasp rational close planting as the key to continuing the leap forward.

In promoting rational close planting, the County Party Committee led the masses in carrying out a serious struggle against right-leaning conservative thought. After the opinion of implementing rational close planting was put forward, a small number of cadres expressed opposition, they thought: "Mountainous areas have less labor, there are not enough conditions." Some people said: "The mountains are high and the water is cold, the frost-free period is short, and there is less sunshine. Close planting is not ventilated and does not allow light to penetrate. It cannot be compared with the plains." In order to break these erroneous arguments, the County Party Committee first summarized the advanced experiences of Wulin, Lafa, Xin'an and other communes in 1958, which implemented shrinking ridges to increase rows, wide sowing and close planting, and intercropping and close planting, thereby achieving an average yield of 453 jin per mu. Subsequently, more than 15,000 production team leaders, ordinary commune members, and old commune members were organized to visit the sites to "learn from experience." After these people publicized it to the vast number of commune members, they also led the masses to launch a large-scale special debate throughout the county on the topic of "Can mountainous areas be planted closely?" and "Can close planting increase production?" During the debate, the commune members not only used the experience of increased production through close planting in Wulin, Lafa and other communes to criticize the right-leaning conservative thought that mountainous areas cannot be planted closely, but also found a method of intercropping corn and soybeans based on the characteristics of the mountainous areas, solving problems such as difficulty in ventilation and light transmission. Commune members of the Qianjin People's Commune also used the fact that women's labor increased after the establishment of canteens, and the different planting and transplanting times for dry and paddy fields, which can support each other, to refute the theory of "insufficient labor" for implementing rational close planting.

Ideological unity produces great material strength. At the beginning of spring plowing and sowing, a high tide of competition emerged throughout the county in which communes and teams competed to be more energetic, to start earlier, and to implement rational close planting better. As a result, the area of intercropping and close planting of corn and soybeans in the county reached more than 80% of the total area, and other crops were also basically planted with small ridges instead of large ridges, shrinking ridges to increase rows, and rational close planting. When rice transplanting began, the county experienced a serious drought. Due to the transfer of a large number of laborers to fight the drought, the number of people transplanting rice decreased relatively, which brought difficulties to the implementation of close planting. At this time, under the leadership of the County Party Committee, the communes launched a competition movement of "Everyone works a full shift, and no household is idle," greatly tapping labor potential. On the other hand, more than 20,000 urban residents, government cadres, and school teachers and students were organized to participate in drought resistance and rice transplanting; and they received strong support from the local garrison, thus enabling 70% of the paddy fields to achieve rational close planting, ensuring increased production.

This year's bumper harvest has inspired the people of the county with the enthusiasm and confidence to strive for continued leap forward next year. Under the leadership of the County Party Committee, the winter water conservancy construction and winter fertilizer accumulation movement have already begun.

### 驳倒右倾思想推广合理密植  蛟河粮食产量越过黄河  全县平均亩产五百多斤提前八年超过农业纲要指标

    驳倒右倾思想推广合理密植
    蛟河粮食产量越过黄河
    全县平均亩产五百多斤提前八年超过农业纲要指标
    新华社讯　吉林省蛟河县今年农业生产取得辉煌成果。全县四十四万多亩粮食作物，平均每亩产量在去年四百零四斤的基础上增加到五百一十九斤，超过了全国农业发展纲要规定的黄河以南淮河以北地区的产量指标，全县粮食总产量比去年增加11.1％。
    蛟河县地处高寒山区，无霜期只有一百二十天，1958年以前连年遭霜减产。去年由于抓住了适时早种和多种高产作物这两项基本增产措施，战胜了早霜为害，获得了空前丰收。今年1月，中共蛟河县委在总结去年大跃进的经验时，发现还有很多增产潜力没有发挥，在推行农业“八字宪法”中，对密植一项贯彻不够。因此决定今年在继续推行适时早种和多种高产作物以及其他增产措施的同时，坚决抓紧合理密植这个关键，继续跃进。
    在推行合理密植中，县委领导群众同右倾保守思想展开了严肃的斗争。实行合理密植的意见提出后，少数干部曾表示反对，他们认为：“山区劳力少，不够条件。”有的人说：“山高水冷，无霜期短，日照少，密植不通风不透光，不能和平原地区相比。”为了破除这些错误论点，县委首先在乌林、拉法、新站等公社，总结了这些单位1958年实行缩垅增行，宽播密植，间作密植，因而取得了平均亩产四百五十三斤的先进经验。随后，便陆续组织一万五千多名生产队长、一般社员和老社员到现场参观“取经”。通过这些人向广大社员进行宣传之后，又领导群众以“山区能不能密植？”“密植能不能增产？”为题，在全县范围内展开了一个声势浩大的专题辩论。在辩论中，社员们不但用乌林、拉法等公社密植增产的经验，批判了山区不能密植的右倾保守思想，而且还根据山区特点找到了苞米、大豆实行间作的方法，解决了不易通风、透光等问题。前进人民公社社员在辩论中还用办了食堂妇女劳力增加，旱、水田播种、插秧时间不同，能够互相支援的事实，驳倒了实行合理密植“劳力不足”论。
    思想统一，产生了巨大的物质力量。春耕播种开始，全县就出现了一个比干劲足、比动手早、比合理密植好的社与社、队与队的竞赛高潮，结果，全县苞米和大豆实行间作密植的面积，达到总面积的80％以上，其它各种作物也基本上作到了大垅改小垅、缩垅增行和合理密植。水田插秧开始时，全县出现了严重旱象，由于抽调大批劳力抗旱，插秧人数相对减少，给实行密植带来了困难。这时，各公社在县委领导下，掀起了一个“人人出满勤，家家无闲人”的竞赛运动，大挖劳动潜力。另一方面组织城镇居民、机关干部、学校师生共两万多人参加抗旱插秧；并得到了当地驻军的大力支援，因而使70％的稻田做到了合理密植，保证了增产。
    今年的大丰收，鼓舞了全县人民力争明年继续跃进的干劲和信心。在县委领导下，全县水利冬修和冬季积肥运动，已经展开。
