    Helping Commune Members Arrange Their Lives
    Party organizations at all levels in Yixian County, Liaoning Province, organized cadres to conduct in-depth inspections and visits to help commune members properly arrange their winter lives. In order to allow commune members to regularly eat fresh vegetables in winter, a total of 8,499 vegetable cellars were dug by all canteens and individual commune members in the county, storing more than 51 million jin of vegetables, an average of 200 to 300 jin of vegetables per person. Communes and production teams also mobilized commune members to collect firewood and haul coal to ensure that commune members had firewood to burn in the winter and could spend the winter warmly. After such careful arrangements were made for each item from eating to burning, from clothing to housing, the labor attendance rate in all communes in the county increased again compared to the past, setting off a winter production upsurge centered on mountain and river management and fertilizer accumulation and production.

    帮助社员安排生活
    辽宁省义县各级党组织，组织干部深入检查访问，帮助社员妥善安排冬季生活。为了让社员在冬季经常吃到新鲜蔬菜，全县各食堂和社员个人一共挖菜窖八千四百九十九个，贮菜五千一百多万斤，平均每人贮菜二百到三百斤。各公社、生产队并发动社员打柴拉煤，以保证社员冬季有柴烧，暖暖和和地过冬。经过这样从吃到烧、从穿到住逐项逐户地妥善安排以后，全县各公社的劳动出勤率比过去又有提高，掀起了以治山治水和积肥造肥为中心的冬季生产高潮。
