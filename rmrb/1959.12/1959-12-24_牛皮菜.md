Chard

Chard is also known as pigweed, thick-skinned vegetable, and Swiss chard. It is widely cultivated in Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and other places, and can also be grown in the north. Its advantages are high yield, tenderness, juiciness, low fiber content, and pigs love to eat it. It is a top-quality green fodder for feeding pigs.

In South China, chard is generally planted in late autumn and used in winter and spring. This is the time of year when green fodder for pig raising is most lacking. The harvest period of chard is very long. If planted well, it can be harvested for more than half a year, and there are very few diseases and insect pests, and management is simple.

Chard can be picked in rotation, by the piece and by the day. (Attached picture)

　　牛皮菜
    牛皮菜又叫猪母菜、厚皮菜、莙达菜等。四川、贵州和广东等地栽培很普遍，北方也能种植。它的优点是产量高，柔嫩多汁，纤维少，猪爱吃，是喂猪的上等青绿饲料。
    在华南一带，牛皮菜一般都在秋末栽种，冬春采用，这时正是一年中养猪青饲料最感缺乏的时候。牛皮菜的收获期很长，种得好的，可连收半年以上，并且病虫害极少，管理简便。
    牛皮菜可分片分天轮流采摘。（附图片）
