Strengthening Winter Management of Rapeseed
	*People's Daily* Commentator

This year's over-fulfillment of the national winter rapeseed planting plan is a major event in oil production. Rapeseed is one of China's most important oil crops, with its annual oil production accounting for about 20% of the total edible oil production. Therefore, planting more rapeseed, managing it well, and striving for a bumper harvest of rapeseed can not only increase the supply of edible oil, but also boost people's confidence and drive to promote an all-round leap forward in all kinds of oil production by every possible means.

This year, most regions have planted more rapeseed, planted it earlier, planted it faster, and planted it better, grasping both the planting area and the timing and quality of planting. In the implementation of yield-increasing measures such as soil, fertilizer, seeds, and density, there has generally been an improvement compared to last year. Judging from the current production situation, about 80% of the rapeseed seedlings are growing well. However, experience has proven that grasping production not only requires starting from the beginning, but also grasping each link tightly, without loosening any link. Planting well must be combined with managing well and harvesting well, with all three being done well to achieve a bumper harvest.

Rapeseed is a winter crop with a long growing period, lasting half a year from planting to harvest. It must not only survive the harsh winter, but also the spring, which is characterized by alternating cold and warm temperatures and unpredictable changes. This requires more meticulous strengthening of field management of rapeseed. It would be wrong to think that because more rapeseed has been planted this year and planted well, there is reason for blind optimism, or even to neglect strengthening the management of rapeseed. Secondly, the experience of recent years has proven that ensuring that rapeseed passes the "winter hurdle" well is a very important link in increasing production. When Zhejiang Province summarized the experience of thirty mu of high-yielding rapeseed fields with a yield of over 300 jin per mu during the summer harvest this year, one important experience was that the amount of topdressing in winter accounted for more than two-thirds of the total topdressing amount. The reason why rapeseed yields were not high in the past was precisely because there was no good management in winter. In the past, under the small-scale peasant economy, there was a shortage of labor and fertilizer, and it was difficult to take care of both before and after the New Year. This was an objectively existing difficulty. Today, the situation is completely different. Communes can rationally allocate labor on a larger scale, and can also make every effort to tap sources of fertilizer according to the needs of production for fertilizer. We should give full play to the superiority of the people's communes and strengthen the winter management of rapeseed.

What work needs to be done currently to strengthen the field management of rapeseed? The main tasks are to seize the time to apply topdressing, prevent freezing, cultivate and earth up, so that the rapeseed seedlings can develop well before freezing, achieving thick roots and large leaves, and enhancing cold resistance. According to scientific research, if the rapeseed seedlings develop well before freezing, the plants are strong, the leaves are numerous, the main roots are thick, the number of axillary buds is large, and the cell concentration of the leaves is high, then the cold resistance is strong, the seedlings will develop quickly in the spring, the branches will be numerous, the flowering and pod formation will also be numerous, and the yield will be high. For third-class seedlings that were planted late or did not receive basal fertilizer at the time of planting, it is especially necessary to increase the amount of fertilizer applied and strengthen management so that they can quickly catch up with first- and second-class seedlings. Regions that have a past habit of plowing under (i.e., plowing poorly growing rapeseed into the field as fertilizer in the spring) should pay particular attention to the current field management work. Experience has proven that plowed rapeseed is simply unmanaged rapeseed; as long as management is strengthened, and timely thinning, topdressing, and cultivation are carried out, the rapeseed can grow well and the yield will be high. Plowing rapeseed into the ground as fertilizer is an unscientific and uneconomical practice. Although rapeseed contains oil, the fertilizer effect of the oil content is very low, and it is harmful to the soil and plants. If the rapeseed is pressed for oil and the oil cake is used to fertilize the field, the fertilizer effect is very high. Obviously, plowing one or twenty jin of rapeseed per mu into the field as fertilizer in the spring is not as good as strengthening field management now to make the rapeseed yield per mu reach one hundred or ten jin. In this way, in addition to obtaining more edible oil, more oil cake can also be obtained as fertilizer. It is hoped that all localities will change the practice of plowing rapeseed and actively strengthen field management, so as to "plant one mu and harvest one mu."

The key to doing a good job in the field management of rapeseed lies in strengthening leadership. Leaders at all levels must grasp rapeseed as they grasp grain. In addition to solving problems ideologically, it is necessary to vigorously grasp measures, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, fix the professional teams for field management of rapeseed, and ensure that every field is managed by someone and that every measure is implemented. Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, in addition to establishing professional teams for rapeseed fields, also implemented a "field chief system" so that measures are implemented in the field and to the person. This is a very good method.

In order to strive for high yields of rapeseed, the "Thousand, Five, Ten Thousand" bumper harvest competition movement carried out in Zhejiang Province (i.e., wheat yields of 1,000 jin per mu, rapeseed yields of 500 jin per mu, and green manure of 10,000 jin) has played a great role in promoting planting. Now, with field management as the center, the competition movement is being pushed to a new climax. After the Huidong Production Team of Huinan Commune in Nanhui County, Shanghai, proposed a rapeseed bumper harvest competition to the city, many production teams in various counties and communes throughout the city have responded and launched counterpart competitions. Some places have also put forward combat slogans such as "meticulous, not letting go of a seedling, not missing a link, not giving up a step," as well as methods of the mass line such as "setting up advanced models, establishing pacesetters," and organizing large-scale inspections and debates, which have greatly strengthened the field management of rapeseed. Now, the masses have high confidence and are full of energy. We should take advantage of this great opportunity to rationally organize the labor force, fully utilize various effective measures and experiences, and launch a vigorous and down-to-earth mass field management movement for rapeseed to strive for a bumper harvest of rapeseed in 1960.

    加强油菜越冬管理
    本报评论员
    今年全国冬油菜超额完成播种计划，是油料生产中的一件大事。油菜是我国最主要的油料作物之一，历年产油量占食油总产量的20％左右。因此，多种油菜，管好油菜，力争油菜大丰收，不仅能增加食油供应，而且能鼓舞人们的信心和干劲，千方百计促进各种油料生产全面跃进。
    今年绝大部分地区的油菜种的多、种的早、种的快、种的好，既抓住了播种面积，也抓住了播种的时间和质量。在贯彻土、肥、种、密等增产措施方面，一般都比去年有所提高。从目前生产情况看，约有80％左右的油菜苗都生长很好。但是，经验证明，抓生产不仅要从头抓起，而且还要环环抓紧，一环不松，种好还要管好、收好，三好并一好，才能实现大丰收。
    油菜是越冬作物，它的生长期较长，从种到收为时达半年之久，既要越过严酷的寒冬，又要越过寒暖交替、变化多端的春季，这就要求更加细致地加强对油菜的田间管理。如果认为今年油菜种的多、种的好，从而产生盲目乐观思想，甚至忽视对油菜加强管理，这是不对的。其次，几年来的经验证明，保证油菜过好“越冬关”，是非常重要的一个增产环节。浙江省今年夏收时总结了三十块亩产三百斤以上的油菜丰产田，重要经验之一，就是在冬季的追肥数量占到总追肥量的三分之二以上。过去油菜产量之所以不高，也正是由于在冬季没有很好的管理。过去在小农经济情况下，劳力缺、肥料少，顾了年前顾不了年后，这是客观上存在的困难。在今天，情况完全不一样了。公社可以在更大范围内合理调配劳力，也能够根据生产对肥料的需要，千方百计地挖掘肥源。我们应该充分发挥人民公社的优越性，加强油菜越冬管理。
    加强油菜田间管理，当前需要做哪些工作？主要的是抓紧追肥、防冻、中耕培土，使油菜苗在封冻前有良好发育，达到根粗叶大，增强抗寒能力。根据科学研究，油菜苗在冻前发育的好、植株壮大、叶片多、主根粗、腋芽数目多、叶的细胞浓度大，抗寒能力就强，开春就发苗快、分枝多，开花结荚也多，产量也就高。对种的迟、播种时未施基肥而出现的三类苗，尤其要增加施肥量，加强管理，使它迅速赶上一、二类苗。过去有翻耕习惯的地区（即春播时把生长不好的油菜犁入田内作肥料），特别要重视当前的田间管理工作。经验证明，翻耕的油菜就是不加管理的油菜；只要加强管理，及时的间苗、追肥、中耕，就可以使油菜长得好，产量高。把油菜翻耕到地里作肥料，是一个既不科学又不经济的做法。油菜籽虽然含有油分，但油脂含的肥效却很低，并有害于土壤和植物。如果把油菜籽榨了油，用油饼肥田，肥效却很高。显然，春天把每亩产一、二十斤的油菜籽翻到田里作肥料，就不如当前加强田间管理，使菜籽亩产量达到百十斤，这样，除了多得食油，还可获得更多的油饼作肥料。希望各地改变翻耕油菜的做法，积极加强田间管理，做到“种一亩，收一亩”。
    做好油菜田间管理，关键在于加强领导。各级领导要像抓粮食一样抓油菜，除了从思想上解决问题以外，就是要大抓措施，充分发挥人民公社优越性，把油菜田间管理的专业队伍固定下来，作到田田有人管，措施件件有着落。江苏盐城县对油菜田除了建立专业队伍，还实行了“田长制”，使措施落实到田、到人，这是个很好的办法。
    为了争取油菜高产，浙江省开展的“千、五、万”丰产竞赛运动（即小麦亩产千斤，油菜五百斤，绿肥一万斤），在播种时已起到极大的推动作用，现在又以田间管理为中心，把竞赛运动推向新的高潮。上海市南汇县惠南公社惠东生产队向全市提出油菜丰产竞赛的倡议后，全市各县各公社的不少生产队已纷纷响应，展开了对口赛。有些地方还提出了“一丝不苟，一苗不放，一环不漏，一步不让”等战斗口号，以及“树先进、立标兵”和组织大检查、大辩论等群众路线的方法，大大加强了油菜田间管理工作。现在，群众的信心高，干劲足，我们应该乘此大好时机，合理地组织好劳动力，充分运用各种行之有效的措施和经验，掀起一个既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实的大搞群众性的油菜田间管理运动，为实现1960年油菜大丰收而奋斗。
