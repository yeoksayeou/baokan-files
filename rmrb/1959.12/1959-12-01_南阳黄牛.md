    Nanyang Yellow Cattle
    Li Zhun
    I'd often heard in the past that Nanyang yellow cattle were good, famous throughout the country, but I knew very little about how exactly they were good. This time, coming to Nanyang, I visited the yellow cattle farm of the Liaohe People's Commune in Nanyang, and I truly learned a lot, and it was indeed exciting.
    After breakfast, the light rain cleared, and Comrade Wang Baozhen, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, and I set off for the farm on bicycles. Comrade Wang Baozhen is only in her twenties this year. Before the land reform, she was still a "child bride," but now she is the first secretary of the Party committee of this large commune of 90,000 people. She is very familiar with the situation here. She told us that their commune now has more than 7,300 head of yellow cattle, an increase of more than 1,100 head compared to before communization. With specialized farms and breeding stations, the reproduction of yellow cattle has been faster, and the reproduction rate last year increased to 20%.
    Speaking of large cattle, she said with a smile: "Now large yellow cattle are rare and precious. When farmers were working individually before cooperation, large cattle were not popular. The bigger the cattle, the fewer people fed them, because each household had little land, couldn't use them, and couldn't afford to feed them. Some families sold them, and some even slaughtered them; before we were organized, large yellow cattle were also unlucky!"
    We passed through several miles of high-yield cotton fields. The cotton was growing very well, more than one person deep. The leaves were all dyed red by the frost, and the cotton bolls were bursting with fluff, like a patch of white snow. Looking as far as the eye could see, the red and white were particularly beautiful. Passing through the cotton fields, at the foot of a mountain ridge, we saw the farm. The first thing that caught our eye was the herd of reddish-brown and beige cattle.
    Walking to the entrance of the farm office, a chubby old man walked up to us. He greeted us with a beaming smile and whispered to Wang Baozhen: "Two more cows are about to give birth to calves."
    He is Yao Qingge, the head of the farm, who was originally the head of a high-level cooperative. After the establishment of the commune, he became the head of the farm. The masses once gave him the nickname "livestock fanatic" and also called him "local expert."
    Comrade Wang Baozhen said to him: "Qingge, tell them about our yellow cattle!" He smiled and squinted his eyes, saying: "So, you want me to 'talk cattle' again."
    He led us to see the cattle herd. A large group was tied up in the square, some large, some small, each one strong and vigorous, with bright coats and well-fed. Seeing these large cattle, we couldn't help but be pleasantly surprised.
    "These are the breeding cattle you have cultivated, right?"
    He smiled and shook his head, saying: "These are the general draft cattle raised for the teams. We are very strict in selecting breeding cattle. Come here and see." He then led us to another field, where only rows of sturdy bulls were tied up, the large ones as tall as five feet, standing there like a small hill.
    At this time, the old man Yao Qingge began to "talk cattle" to us! He said: "Nanyang yellow cattle are good, with several characteristics, which are also our current standards for selecting breeding cattle. They have six big and four small features. The first is a large body and great strength; the second is large nostrils, able to withstand the heat, and able to breathe out several times when pulling a plow at the end of the field; the third is large eyes, and also tight eyelids, able to walk at night; the fourth is a large head and large neck, with the neck bulging like a basin, which the masses call 'high in the front and spreading in the back, able to break the plow'; the fifth is large hooves, like wooden bowls, so that they don't sink in muddy roads; and the last is a large mouth, able to eat a lot. The four small features are small ears, like a whittled bamboo tube, these cattle are clever; another is small horns, emphasizing flat horns, these cattle have a good temperament, kind; and then there is a small tail, and small testicles, these cattle walk fast, nimbly, we call it able to 'feed tightly half a step, and don't step on the feet.'"
    Listening to Yao Qingge's talk, so profound and vivid, he truly deserves to be called a "local expert." He added: "In fact, the characteristics of Nanyang yellow cattle are not limited to these. We also emphasize 'clear tendons and bright bones, broad chest and ring-like ribs.' As the saying goes: a bushel can be placed in the front chest, and a hand can be placed in the back, these cattle all have strength. Ribs like a string of rings spread open can eat grass, and the cattle will be strong." As he spoke, he pointed to those breeding cattle and said: "Look, these bulls that we have selected are all like this." We carefully looked at several breeding cattle, and sure enough, they all had the characteristics of several big and several small features he mentioned. We then asked: "Did Nanyang yellow cattle always have these characteristics in the past?" He smiled and said: "Who could afford to cultivate them in the past! Even during the cooperative period, we couldn't afford to run a farm. Only after communization, can we have the conditions to breed the best yellow cattle." He pointed to a Dutch breed cow and said: "We plan to mate the Nanyang bull with this cow, and in the future, cultivate the best cattle that can both work and produce milk."
    At this time, Comrade Yao Qingge enthusiastically introduced to us that they not only cultivate good yellow cattle here, but also breed eighty Soviet high-blooded horses, more than a thousand boxes of Italian bees, and Angora rabbits. As we were talking, suddenly three children of twelve or thirteen years old drove a large group of snow-white fat ducks from the small river next to the farm.
    Yao Qingge pointed to them and said: "These are 'Beijing ducks' that they are raising. They have already laid more than a thousand eggs this year. Next year, we will incubate and promote these ducks on a large scale." Then he smiled and said: "Don't look at these kids as high school graduates, they also talk about 'politics in command'! They also want to strive for 'promoting superior varieties'! Once, a duck laid an egg in the river, and they said: we can't let the commune have one less Beijing duck in the future! After discussing, the three of them took off their pants and went into the river to find it. As a result, they retrieved the duck egg."
    Yao Qingge told their stories so vividly and interestingly that we looked at the three children and felt they were really lovely. Just then, they also seemed to know that we were talking about them, turning their heads and smiling at us, showing a mouthful of small white teeth.

    南阳黄牛
    李准
    过去常听说南阳黄牛好，闻名全国，可是南阳黄牛究竟怎样好，却知道的很少。这一次到南阳来，访问了南阳潦河人民公社的黄牛牧场，真领了不少教，也确令人兴奋。
    吃罢早饭，小雨初晴，我们和公社党委第一书记王宝珍同志骑着自行车，向牧场出发了。王宝珍同志今年才二十多岁，土改前还是个
  “童养媳”，可是现在她已经是这个九万人口大公社党委的第一书记。她对这里情况非常熟悉，她告诉我们：他们公社现在已经有七千三百多头黄牛，比公社化前增加了一千一百多头。有了专门的牧场和配种站，黄牛繁殖快了，去年的繁殖率就增长到20％。
    谈到大牛，她笑着说：“如今大黄牛都稀罕珍贵了。在合作化前农民单干时候，大个牛却不吃香。个子越大越没人喂，因为一家一户土地少，用不了它，也喂不起它。有些家卖了，有个别的还杀了；没有组织起来的时候，大黄牛也倒霉！” 
    我们穿过一片几里长的棉花丰产田，棉花长的很好，有一人多深。叶子都被霜染红了，棉桃正吐着絮，像一片白雪。极目望去，红白相映，煞是好看。穿过棉花田，在一道山岭下边，看见牧场了。首先映入我们眼中的，是那一片枣红色和米黄色的牛群。
    走到牧场办公室门口，迎面走过来一个胖胖的老汉。他笑迷迷地向我们打着招呼，又轻声地对王宝珍说：“又有两只牛要生小牛了。”
    他就是牧场的场长姚清阁，原来是高级社的社长，公社成立以后，当牧场场长。群众曾经给他送个外号叫“牲口迷”，也叫“土专家”。
    王宝珍同志对他说：“清阁，你给人家说说咱们这黄牛吧！”他笑了，又迷着眼睛说：“又要我‘论牛’了。”
    他领着我们去看牛群，在广场上拴了一大片，有大的，有小的，一个个体大力强，皮色鲜明，吃得滚瓜流油。看见这些大牛，我们不禁惊喜起来。
    “这就是你们培养的种牛吧？”
    他微笑着摇摇头说：“这是给队里养的一般耕牛，种牛我们挑得严格的很，你们来这里看。”说着他又把我们领到一片场上，只见拴了几行全是一些虎头虎脑的公牛，大的足有五尺来高，站到那里像一座小山一样。
    这时，姚清阁老汉向我们“论”起牛来了！他说：“南阳黄牛好，有它几个特点，也是我们现在挑选种牛的标准。它有六大四小，头一宗是身体大，力量强；再一宗是鼻孔要大，能受得热，拉犁到地头能呼出几口气来；第三眼睛要大，还要眼皮紧，能走夜路；第四是头大脖项大，脖项隆起像个盆子一样，群众叫作‘前高后洒，拽断犁耙’；第五是?大，要像个木碗样子，走起泥路不陷腿；再一点就是嘴要大，能吃得进东西。这四小是耳朵要小，像个削的竹筒，这种牛性灵；再一个就是牛角要小，讲究平头角，这种牛脾性好，善良；还有就是尾巴要小，睾丸要小，这种牛走的快，利洒，我们叫作能喂紧半步，不要对脚板。”
    听姚清阁谈得这样精深、生动，真不愧是“土专家”。他又说：“其实南阳黄牛特点，还不止这些。我们还讲究‘明筋亮骨，宽胸环胁’。俗话说：前胸放下斗，后边放下手，这种牛都有气力。胁骨像一串环子一样撑开能吃进草，牛就强壮。”他说着指着那些种牛说：“你们看，我们挑的这些公牛，都是这样。”我们仔细看了几头种牛，果然像他说的，都有那几大几小的特点。我们就问：“是不是南阳黄牛过去都有这些特点；”他笑着说：“过去谁能培养得起！就是合作社时候，也办不起牧场呀。公社化后，我们才能有条件繁殖最优良的黄牛了。”他又指着一头荷兰种母牛说：“我们准备把南阳公牛和这头母牛交配，将来培殖出既能干活，又能挤奶的最优良的牛来。”
    姚清阁同志这时又热情地向我们介绍说，他们这里不但培殖好黄牛，培养繁殖的还有八十匹苏联高血种马，一千多箱意大利蜂和安哥拉种兔。我们正在说着，忽然从牧场的小河旁有三个十二三岁的孩子赶过来一大群雪白的肥鸭。
    姚清阁指着他们说：“他们放的这是‘北京鸭’，今年已经生了一千多个蛋了，明年我们要大量孵育推广这种鸭子。”接着他又笑着说：“你们别看这几个小孩是高小毕业学生，他们也讲‘政治挂帅’呀，还要提出为‘推广优良品种’而奋斗哩！有一次，有一只鸭子把蛋生在河里了，他们说：咱们不能让公社将来少一只北京鸭子！商量以后，三个人就脱光屁股下河里摸起来，结果把那只鸭蛋给捞出来了。”
    姚清阁讲他们的故事，讲得那么生动，有趣，我们就看着那三个小孩子，觉得实在可爱。就在这时，他们也好像知道我们在谈他，扭着头朝我们笑着，嘴里呲着一口小白牙齿。
