Mountainous Areas Build Road Networks

"Mountains behind mountains surround houses, carrying firewood and grain by shoulder pole. Visiting relatives and friends takes half a day, and still you're looking at the mountain across from you." This was a true reflection of the transportation situation in the Hecheng area of Gutian County, Fujian, before liberation.

Hecheng People's Commune is more than one hundred *li* away from Gutian County and is a mountainous area. It is rich in timber, bamboo, and mineral resources, but due to inconvenient transportation, these abundant resources could not be transported out of the mountains.

After the establishment of the People's Communes, the commune organized a large road-building force, cutting through mountains and ridges to build roads. In less than a year, the entire commune built a 111-*li* road network. Previously, *Chinese fir* and hardwood that could only be used as firewood were transported out for the first time, with over 8,000 cubic meters supporting socialist construction; wild plants and medicinal materials covering the mountains and plains were also continuously transported from the mountainous areas to various places. The face of the mountainous area is rapidly changing.

    山区修建起公路网
    “门前屋后山连山，挑柴运粮不离担。探亲访友走半日，抬头还在对面山。”这是解放前，福建古田县鹤塘一带山区交通状况的真实写照。
    鹤塘人民公社离古田县城一百多华里，是个山区。盛产木材、毛竹，矿藏丰富，只因交通不便，丰富的资源一直无法运出山区。
    人民公社化以后，公社组织了修路大军，劈山削岭，修建公路。在不到一年的时间内，全社修通了一百一十一里的公路网。过去只好当柴烧的杉松、硬木，第一次运出八千多立方米支援社会主义建设；满山遍野的野生植物、药材，也从山区源源不断地运往各地。山区的面貌，在迅速地改变着。
