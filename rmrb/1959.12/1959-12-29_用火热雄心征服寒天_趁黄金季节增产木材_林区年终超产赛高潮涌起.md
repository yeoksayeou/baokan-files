Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: Lumber workers in various regions of the country are now launching a warm year-end overproduction competition to overfulfill this year's timber production tasks and strive for a good start in the new year.

Winter is the golden season for timber production. Although the northern forest areas of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia are frozen, the overproduction movement of the forest workers in each area is in full swing. By December 20, Heilongjiang Province had sent 47,779 people and 51,136 head of livestock into the mountains for winter transport. By December 16, Jilin Province had sent a total of 36,216 people and more than 5,700 head of livestock into the mountains. In Inner Mongolia, the number of horse teams entering the mountains has exceeded 400. The 1,500 horse teams that Heilongjiang Province is supporting Inner Mongolia with will also arrive by the end of December. Due to the increase in manpower and equipment for collecting timber (collecting the felled timber to forest railways, highways, or streams for transportation), production in various forest areas has grown rapidly. The daily transport volume of Heilongjiang Province's forest railways has increased from 21,000 cubic meters at the beginning of the month to 24,000 cubic meters; the daily transport volume of automobiles has increased from 4,000 cubic meters to 7,000 cubic meters. How much the timber production task can be overfulfilled this year and whether there can be a good start in timber production next year depends on the current felling and collection and transportation of timber. To this end, Party committees at all levels in the forest areas are currently strengthening leadership, and the vast number of workers are working enthusiastically. They said: "We vow to conquer the frozen weather with burning ambition." In the first twelve days of December, the Genhe Forestry Bureau transported 15,600 cubic meters of timber, an increase of 10% compared to the entire month of November.

The main tasks of the northern forest areas are currently collecting and transporting timber, and also preparing for felling next year. In the southern forest areas, the main tasks are currently large-scale felling, repairing various timber collection roads and rafting waterways, and striving for a good start next year. According to incomplete statistics from nine provinces and regions, including Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Guizhou, by December 20, 11.3 million cubic meters of timber had been felled for next year, and 4.5 million cubic meters had been collected on the banks of large and small rivers and roadsides for transportation. Hunan Province had felled 3.51 million cubic meters of timber by December 15. After comprehensively overfulfilling this year's timber production tasks, Dongkou County in this province immediately launched next year's felling work, and has now felled 110,000 cubic meters of timber, built more than 45 kilometers of various timber collection flat roads, manufactured 120 wooden carts, and built approximately 12,000 meters of various timber collection cableways and chutes. In response to the call for a "good start next year," timber production workers at the Nanping Forestry Administration in Fujian Province had felled 2.09 million cubic meters of timber for next year by December 11.

Recently, the Ministry of Forestry sent a New Year's greeting letter to the forestry workers and the vast number of people's commune members participating in afforestation, forest management, and timber production throughout the country, congratulating them on their achievements on the forestry front in 1959 and extending cordial greetings to them. The greeting letter called on the workers and commune members on the forestry front to guarantee the continued leap forward in forestry production and construction in 1960.

　　用火热雄心征服寒天  趁黄金季节增产木材
    林区年终超产赛高潮涌起
    新华社28日讯　全国各地林区职工，为了更多地超额完成今年木材生产任务和争取明年开门红，现在掀起了一个热烈的年终超产竞赛高潮。
    冬季是木材生产的黄金季节。东北和内蒙古等地的北方林区虽然是冰封雪冻，各林区职工的超产运动却搞得热火朝天。黑龙江省到12月20日入山大搞冬运的人数已达四万七千七百七十九人，牲畜五万一千一百三十六头。吉林省到12月16日入山人数共达三万六千二百一十六人，牲畜五千七百多头。内蒙古各林区入山的马套子已经超过了四百套。黑龙江省支援内蒙古林区的一千五百付马套子，也将在12月下旬到齐。由于山上集材（把采伐的木材集中到森林铁路、公路或小溪边待运）人马增加，各林区生产都有了迅速增长。黑龙江省森林铁路日运量，已由月初的二万一千立方米提高到了二万四千立方米；汽车日运量由四千立方米提高到了七千立方米。今年木材生产任务能超产多少和明年木材生产的开门红都决定于当前的采伐和集运材。为此，目前林区各级党委正在加强领导，广大职工干劲冲天。他们表示：“誓以火热雄心，征服地冻天寒”。根河林业局在12月的前十二天就运出了木材一万五千六百立方米，比11月份全月运出量还增长了10％。
    北方林区当前主要是集材和运材，同时也为明年进行采伐。南方各地林区，目前主要是大量采伐，整修各种集材道和流送河道，争取明年开门红。据浙江、安徽、江西、福建、广东、广西、湖南、湖北、贵州等九个省区到12月20日的不完全统计，已为明年采伐木材一千一百三十万立方米，集中到大、小河边和公路边待运的已达四百五十万立方米。湖南省在12月15日就已采伐木材三百五十一万立方米。这个省的洞口县在全面的超额完成今年木材生产任务以后，紧接着开展明年采伐工作，现已采伐木材十一万立方米，并修建了各种集材平车道四十五公里多，制造木拉车一百二十部，修建各种集材索道和滑道约一万二千多米。福建省南平林业管理局的木材生产职工响应“明年开门红”的号召，到12月11日已为明年采伐到木材二百零九万立方米。
    最近，林业部向全国林业职工和参加造林、营林、木材生产的广大人民公社社员发出了一封新年贺信，祝贺他们1959年在林业战线上的成就，向他们致以亲切的慰问。贺信号召林业战线上的职工和社员，保证实现1960年林业生产建设的继续跃进。
