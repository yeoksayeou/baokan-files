Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th December. To fully and rationally utilize natural resources and waste gas, liquids and materials from industrial and agricultural production, relevant departments in Shanghai are further developing research work on the comprehensive utilization of resources. Recently, under the instruction of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Municipal Science and Technology Commission established thirteen comprehensive utilization research collaboration groups in the city, covering coal, petroleum gas, natural gas, sewage and sludge utilization, industrial waste liquid and gas, seawater, slag, agricultural and sideline products, timber, wild plants, animal organs and offal, aquatic products, and factory waste heat. These collaboration groups include relevant scientific research units, universities, production departments, and municipal construction departments throughout the city. The collaboration groups are currently discussing and formulating work plans for next year and are gradually commencing activities.

Shanghai is a comprehensive industrial city with a variety of industries, consuming large quantities of materials every day. Some of these materials are only partially utilized, with the rest discarded as waste; others only play a mediating role in the production process and are discharged with wastewater or evaporate into the air as gas. After treatment, these waste materials can be transformed into useful materials and become raw materials for another industry. For example, Shanghai consumes a large amount of coal each year, most of which is used only as fuel, with low thermal efficiency utilization. If it is processed in a certain way, it can be used to make dyes, plastics, medicines, fertilizers, etc., and their value is more than ten times higher than the value of coal.

In recent years, relevant departments and factories and enterprises in Shanghai have paid attention to the study of comprehensive utilization of materials and regarded it as an important aspect of carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement. Significant achievements have been made in the comprehensive utilization of coal dry distillation, petroleum gas, agricultural and sideline products, and various industrial waste materials, waste liquids, and waste gases, opening up a rich source of raw materials for industrial production. This year, the Shanghai Refinery has successively turned the petroleum waste gas generated during the crude oil processing into sixty-three products. For example, cracked gas, which used to be used as fuel, is processed into liquid hydrocarbons that can replace gasoline and calcium carbide, and mixed alcohols containing propanol and butanol, which are important raw materials for medicine. The acid and alkaline residues that used to be discharged into the Huangpu River are used to make aluminum naphthenate soap, a fishing net preservative, etc. Among them, twenty-one have been put into production, and the output value accounts for about 5% of the total output value of the factory. The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Research Institute and the Meat Joint Processing Plant have successfully trial-produced dozens of products such as insulin and cephalin using animal offal; the Shanghai Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory extracts various valuable drugs from pig organs. The value of these products far exceeds the value of meat processing itself. In addition, the comprehensive utilization of waste steel slag and blast furnace slag to produce building materials and cement by the Building Materials Research Institute and the Shanghai Cement Factory, and the comprehensive utilization of various agricultural and sideline products and wild aromatic plants successfully researched by universities and research units, are of great economic significance.

The result of carrying out research on the comprehensive utilization of materials has solved many raw material supply problems. The raw material soda ash required by paper mills was once in short supply. The staff of the Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Purchasing and Supply Station processed the sodium sulfide in the steel slag discarded by metallurgical factories into mixed alkaline liquid, which solved the raw material problem for the paper mills. The Taishan Organic Chemical Factory, which produces saccharin, has independently developed recycling equipment using a combination of indigenous and modern methods, and has basically achieved zero waste liquid, waste gas, and waste materials in the entire factory. All these wastes are recycled and become raw materials for saccharin. According to relevant departments, from the fourth quarter of last year to the end of the third quarter of this year, the city recovered 10,000 tons of sulfuric acid from waste sulfuric acid alone, calculated at 100% concentration.

The Shanghai Science and Technology Commission recently conducted a survey on the comprehensive utilization of the above aspects, and believes that although considerable achievements have been made, due to the dispersed efforts in the past, some departments have not paid enough attention to it, and many available waste materials have not been utilized or have not been fully utilized. Therefore, it was decided to organize cooperation among various departments to further carry out this work.

    增产节约运动的一个重要方面
    充分利用自然资源和废气废料
    上海成立十三个协作组进一步研究综合利用资源
    新华社上海9日电　上海市有关部门进一步开展资源综合利用研究工作，使自然资源和工农业生产中的废气、废液、废料能够得到充分合理的利用。最近市科学技术委员会根据中共上海市委的指示，在全市成立了煤炭、石油气、天然气、污水污泥利用、工业下脚废液废气、海水、矿渣、农副产品、木材、野生植物、畜类脏器及下脚、水产品以及工厂余热等十三个综合利用研究协作组。参加这些协作组的有全市有关科学研究单位、高等学校、生产部门，以及市政建设部门等。协作组目前正在讨论和制订明年的工作计划，并陆续开展活动。
    上海是一个综合性的工业城市，拥有多种行业，每天消耗着大批物资。这些物资，有的只利用了其中一部分，其余的当作废物丢弃了；有的在生产过程中只起了一下媒介作用就随废水排泄或是化为气体从空中飞掉了。这些下脚废料经过处理后，可以变成有用物资，成为另一种工业的原料。如上海每年消耗大量煤炭，其中大部分是仅仅用作燃料的，热效能利用率很低，如果将它们经过一定的处理，可以用来作染料、塑料、药品、化肥等，它们的价值比煤的价值高十多倍。
    近年来，上海有关部门和工厂企业已经注意了研究物资综合利用，而且以此作为开展增产节约运动的一个重要方面。在煤炭干馏、石油气、农副产品，以及各种工业下脚废料、废液、废气等综合利用方面，都取得不少成绩，为工业生产开辟了丰富的原料来源。上海炼油厂今年将原油加工过程中产生的石油废气，先后制成六十三种产品。如将过去当燃料的裂化气加工制成可以代替汽油和电石的液态烃、医药上的重要原料——含有丙醇和丁醇的混合醇；利用过去排入黄浦江的酸碴和碱碴制成渔网防腐剂环烷酸铝皂等，其中已投入生产的二十一种，产值占到全厂总产值的5％左右。上海医药工业研究所和肉类联合加工厂利用牲畜下脚试制成功胰岛素、脑磷脂等几十种产品；上海生物化学制药厂从猪的内脏中提制出多种贵重药物。这些产品的价值都远超过肉类加工本身的价值。此外，建筑材料研究所、上海水泥厂利用废钢渣、高炉渣制建筑材料和水泥，高等学校和研究单位研究成功的多种农副产品及野生芳香植物的综合利用等，都有很大经济意义。
    开展物资综合利用研究的结果，解决了许多原料材料供应问题。造纸厂所需的原料纯碱曾一度不够供应，上海化工原料采购供应站职工将冶金工厂废弃的钢渣里的硫化碱，处理后制成为混合碱液，为造纸厂解决了原料问题。生产糖精的泰山有机化工厂用土洋结合办法自搞回收利用设备，已基本做到全厂无废液、废气、废料，所有这些废弃物经过回收以后又成为糖精的原料。据有关部门了解，去年四季度到今年三季度末，全市仅从废硫酸中回收到的硫酸按100％浓度计，就有一万吨。
    上海科学技术委员会最近对上述各方面综合利用情况作了调查，认为虽然取得不少成绩，但因过去力量分散，有些部门未予重视，许多可用的废弃物资还没有利用或没有充分利用起来，因此决定组织各部门协作，进一步开展这项工作。
