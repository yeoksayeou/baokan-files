    “Diligence” Takes the Lead
    The Dalian Gunny Sack Factory used a blend of about half wild miscellaneous fiber raw materials and jute, and in ten months increased production by more than 950,000 gunny sacks, thus completing the state plan 68 days ahead of schedule.
    In the process of utilizing wild miscellaneous fiber raw materials, the workers of the Dalian Gunny Sack Factory overcame many difficulties. They wanted to use wild miscellaneous fiber raw materials, but no one delivered them to their door. Where could they find them? This was a difficult hurdle. After acquiring the raw materials, they lacked degumming equipment. This was the second hurdle. Having degumming equipment, when spinning and weaving into finished products, there were many breakages, the work was difficult, and production decreased. This was the third hurdle. Each of these three hurdles was more difficult than the last, but they could not stump the heroes of the Dalian Gunny Sack Factory. No one delivered raw materials to their door? Send people to find them in various places. No degumming equipment? Make it yourself. If you can't make a big, foreign one, use small pots and pans, and if you can't build a big factory, build a small one. Many breakages, the work is not easy to do? Initiate a "three-way combination" and create a new set of operating methods, so that the wild miscellaneous fibers can be controlled. No matter how great the difficulties, "diligence" always takes the lead, and action is taken immediately. This is the true color of heroes.
    Now, after the "small autumn harvest" campaign, a large number of wild plants have been collected throughout the country, opening up a broad source of raw materials for the textile and other departments. This is a great condition for increasing production in textile and other departments. However, in the process of processing and using wild plants, there will also be some new problems to be solved, and there will also be certain difficulties. This requires relevant enterprises to learn from the spirit of the Dalian Gunny Sack Factory, muster their energy, dare to think and dare to act, and attack the difficulties. We believe that as long as "diligence" takes the lead, the difficulties in the process of utilizing wild plants can be overcome. With the great harvest of the "small autumn harvest," there will be a great increase in production in textile and other departments!

    “干”字当头
    大连麻袋厂用一半左右的野生杂纤维原料和黄麻混纺，十个月来共增产九十五万多条麻袋，从而提前六十八天完成了国家计划。
    大连麻袋厂职工在利用野生杂纤维原料过程中，战胜了重重困难。他们想利用野生杂纤维原料，可是没有人送上门来，到哪里去找呢？这是一道难关。有了原料，又没有脱胶设备，这是第二道难关。有了脱胶设备，在纺纱织成成品时，断头多，活儿难做，产量降低，这是第三道难关。这三道关，一道比一道难，然而都难不了大连麻袋厂的英雄们。没有人送原料上门来吗？派人到各地找。没有脱胶设备吗？自己动手造，造不了大的洋的，就用小锅小罐，建不了大厂，就建一个小厂。断头多，活儿不好做，来一个“三结合”，创造一套新操作法，叫野生杂纤维听自己驾驭。不管困难多大，总是“干”字当头，说干就干，这才是英雄的本色。
    现在，全国各地经过“小秋收”运动，采集了大批野生植物，为纺织等部门开辟了广阔的原料来源。这是纺织等部门增产的一个大好条件。但是，在野生植物的加工和使用的过程中，也还会有一些新问题需要解决，也还会有一定的困难。这就需要有关企业学习大连麻袋厂的精神，鼓足干劲，敢想敢干，向困难进攻。我们相信，只要“干”字当头，利用野生植物过程中的困难都是可以克服的，随着“小秋收”的大丰收，纺织等部门将会来个大增产！
