In the past, transporting wood required people to drag it.
It was difficult to get the wood out of the river in three years or two.
Since the wooden railway was built,
Flatcars come and go like shuttles.
Each time, two or three meters are transported,
The efficiency is increased more than tenfold.
From then on, physical strength is greatly liberated,
No more hauling by people, no more shoulder abrasion.

    人不拖来肩不磨
    从前运木要人拖
    三年两载难出河
    自从架起木轨道
    平车来往如穿梭
    一次载运两三米
    工效提高十倍多
    从此体力大解放
    人不拖来肩不磨
