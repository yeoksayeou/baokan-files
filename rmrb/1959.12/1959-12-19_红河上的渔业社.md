After the establishment of the first fisheries cooperative on the Red River in northern Vietnam, it leveraged the advantages of collective management and completed 75% of its six-month production plan within two months. On average, each fishing boat in the cooperative caught twice as many fish as each boat in the production team.

The director of the cooperative said: "Three years ago, our lives were relatively difficult. Now, we are not only well-fed and clothed, but we also have savings."

    红河上的渔业社
    越南北方红河上第一个渔业合作社成立之后，发挥了集体经营的优越性，两个月内就完成了六个月生产计划的75％。合作社每个渔船捕到的鱼平均比生产组每船捕的鱼多一倍。
    这个合作社的主任说：“三年前，我们的生活是比较困难的。现在，我们不仅丰衣足食，而且有了节余。”
