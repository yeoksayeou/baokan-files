　　Constantly Revolutionizing and Transforming Nature
    The Ningxia Daily published an editorial on December 16th titled "Constantly Revolutionizing and Transforming Nature." Excerpts are as follows:
    Dialectical materialists have always believed that natural conditions have a great impact on the development of production; however, natural conditions can be changed. In the face of good natural conditions, one should not be intoxicated by the superiority of the conditions; in the face of unfavorable natural conditions, one should not be discouraged by the difficulties. With good natural conditions, we must make full use of them and constantly strive to create better natural conditions, control nature, and develop production. If natural conditions are poor, we must have great ambitions and lofty aspirations to transform nature. This is the revolutionary attitude towards nature.
    To revolutionize against nature, a set of strategies and tactics is indispensable. In soil and water conservation work, it is necessary to implement the policy of "overall planning, comprehensive treatment according to local conditions, concentrated treatment, continuous treatment, combining slope and gully treatment, with emphasis on slope treatment." This complete policy is summarized from the practice of the masses in controlling soil erosion over many years, and it is a strategy and tactic for revolutionizing against nature. The reason why many regions have been successfully treated is precisely because they have fully implemented this policy. In soil and water conservation work, if we do not have overall planning and concentrate on treatment according to local conditions, but instead treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches, it will not play the role of conserving soil and water. If we do not carry out comprehensive and continuous treatment, it will result in only field projects without biological measures; or only biological measures without field projects; or the projects that have been done will not achieve the desired results due to disrepair over the years, and will not achieve the purpose of water storage and soil conservation.
    Soil erosion in mountainous areas is mainly due to the inclination of slopes and the destruction of vegetation cover. This determines that soil and water conservation must focus on slope treatment. However, this does not mean that the treatment of gullies is not important. On the contrary, gully treatment is still an indispensable and important measure. If the slopes are well treated but the gullies are abandoned, soil erosion cannot be completely controlled. In short, the entire set of soil and water conservation policies is a unified whole that is mutually integrated, mutually connected, and mutually causal, and none of them can be lacking, otherwise it will cause losses to soil and water conservation. Concentrated, comprehensive, and continuous treatment should be carried out in a soil erosion area, from the watershed to the foot of the slope, from the branch gullies to the main gullies, from top to bottom, from small to large, forming slopes and gullies. In specific practices, a whole set of "combinations" should be adopted, that is, combining slope treatment with gully treatment, combining tree planting with grass planting, combining biological measures with field projects, combining long-term interests with current interests, combining field projects with dam construction and water storage, combining regular treatment with short-term shock campaigns, and so on.
    The characteristics of soil and water conservation work are: large area, large quantity, and high quality requirements. It is a long-term, complex, and arduous task. Therefore, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and rely on the strength of the masses to work together to do a good job.

### 不断革命改造自然

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

　　不断革命改造自然
    12月16日宁夏日报以“不断革命改造自然”为题发表社论。摘要如下：
    辩证唯物主义者从来就认为：自然条件，对生产的发展有着很大影响；但是，自然条件是可以改变的。在好的自然条件面前，不应因条件优越而陶醉；在不好的自然条件面前，不应因条件困难而气馁。有了好的自然条件，要加以充分利用，并不断努力创造更好的自然条件，控制自然，发展生产。自然条件不好，要树雄心、立大志，改造自然。这就是对待大自然的革命态度。
    要革自然的命，少不了一套战略战术。在水土保持工作中，就必须贯彻“全面规划，因地制宜地综合治理，集中治理，连续治理，坡沟兼治，治坡为主”的水土保持方针。这个完整的方针，是从群众多年来治理水土流失的实践中总结出来的，是革自然的命的战略战术。许多地区之所以治理得成功，正是因为全面贯彻了这一方针。在水土保持工作中，如果不全面规划，因地制宜地集中治理，而是头痛医头、脚疼医脚，就起不到保持水土的作用。如果不综合治理，连续治理，就会形成只有田间工程，没有生物措施；或者只有生物措施，而没有田间工程；或者使已做的工程，因年久失修，起不到应有的效果，同样也达不到蓄水保土的作用。
    山区的水土流失，主要是由于坡面的倾斜和植被面积的破坏所致。这就决定了水土保持必须是治坡为主。但是，这并不等于说治理沟壑就不重要了。相反地，治理沟壑仍然是一项必不可少的重要措施，如果坡面治理好了，放弃了沟壑的治理，同样也不能全面地控制水土流失。总之，水土保持的一整套方针，是互相结合，互相联系，互为因果，不可分割的统一体，缺少哪一项都不行，都会给水土保持带来损失。应当在一个水土流失区域内，从分水岭到坡脚，从支毛沟到干沟，由上而下，由小到大，成坡成沟地集中治理，综合治理，连续治理。在具体做法上，应当采取一整套“相结合”的作法，即治坡与治沟相结合，植树与种草相结合，生物措施与田间工程相结合，长远利益与目前利益相结合，田间工程与打坝蓄水相结合，常年治理与短期突击相结合等等。
    水土保持工作的特点是：面积大，数量多，质量要求高，是一项长期复杂的艰巨任务。因此，必须充分发动群众，依靠群众的力量，大家一齐动手，才能做好。
