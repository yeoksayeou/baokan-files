Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 30th: Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the 4.5 million people of the Suzhou Special District in Jiangsu Province, after a year of hard work and ingenious effort, have achieved even greater victories on the agricultural production front this year compared to last year. Comprehensive bumper harvests of grain, cotton, and oil have been achieved, and high yields have been obtained in all areas of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery.

This year, the total output value of agricultural and sideline production in the entire special district reached 1 billion yuan, an increase of 32.3% compared to last year. Total grain output increased by 25.3% compared to last year. The average grain production per capita for the 3.7 million agricultural population in the district is 1,520 jin. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu on 640,000 mu of cotton fields reached 100 jin, achieving the highest target stipulated in the National Program for Agricultural Development. The average yield of rapeseed per mu also increased by 50% compared to last year, fruits increased by 14%, fish increased by 15%, silkworm cocoons increased by 20%, the number of pigs in pens increased by 28% compared to last year, and chickens, ducks, and geese also increased more than twofold compared to last year.

As a result of the overall leap forward in agricultural and sideline production, the income of commune members and public accumulation have increased accordingly, and the commodity production rate is higher than in previous years. By the end of November, the district had overfulfilled the state grain purchase task, with an average of 525 jin of surplus grain sold per agricultural person in the district. The broad masses of peasants praised this year's comprehensive bumper harvest, saying: "The light of the General Line shines brightly, production and life are getting better every year, let's work harder and strive for the upstream, and next year will be even better than this year."

The fundamental reason why the Suzhou Special District achieved high and even higher yields is that the Party committees at all levels have continuously strengthened political and ideological work, and unswervingly led the masses to strive repeatedly for the upstream. Starting from the autumn planting last year, they vigorously criticized the negative and fearful sentiment of "potential has been exhausted, measures have been used up" and the complacent and numb thinking of "steadily staying in the upstream," and launched the first upsurge of striving for a bumper harvest of summer crops. Subsequently, the responsible comrades of the district and county Party committees seized the favorable opportunity of the full house red harvest of summer crops, and promoted autumn harvest with summer harvest. They set up tens of thousands of opposites with the same conditions but different yields in the entire district, broke the thinking of pride and complacency and willingly staying in the middle reaches, and a vigorous competition for surpassing the contract yield for autumn crops and a rice seedling upgrade movement quickly unfolded in the entire district. After August, the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were deeply publicized and implemented among Party members, cadres, and the broad masses, further boosting morale and adding more measures, pushing the competition for surpassing the contract yield to a new peak. Due to the continuous leap forward in the thinking of the masses, the grain output increased season by season. The rice output in the entire district rose steadily, with an average yield of 600 jin per mu for early rice, 840 jin for mid-season rice, and a jump to 978 jin for late rice, and the miracle of the second crop of double-cropping rice exceeding the first crop appeared.

This year's greater high yield in the Suzhou Special District compared to last year is inseparable from the continuous revolution in agricultural technology. Although the original water conservancy conditions in the Suzhou Special District were relatively good, the old river network system was disorganized, with nets but no outlines, and floods and droughts were not separated. In order to further improve water conservancy conditions, revolutionary measures were taken this year, and large trunk rivers such as the Liu River, Wangyu River, and Zhangjiagang River, as well as 21 medium-sized trunk rivers and a large number of small-scale water conservancy projects were excavated, and the area of mechanized and electrical irrigation was expanded by 1.5 million mu. 3,854,000 mu of rice in the entire district achieved mechanized and electrical irrigation, accounting for 73% of the total rice area. Thus, in this year of severe drought with more than 80 days without rain, the irrigation of rice fields was guaranteed, creating the miracle of no drought in the land during a severe drought year and a bumper rice harvest.

In terms of fertilizer, the Suzhou Special District has always attached importance to planting green manure crops and fermenting refined fertilizers. In order to strive for greater high yields, these experiences were further developed this year. The area of green manure crops in the entire district expanded from 1.3 million mu last year to 1.7 million mu, and it was generally achieved to mix and match green manure, river silt, pig ash, and rice straw to ferment grass pond mud, which improved fertilizer efficiency, so that more than 5 million mu of rice in the entire district had more than 150 dan of refined fertilizer per mu, an increase of more than 20% compared to last year. In terms of fertilization methods, last year's experience was accepted, and topdressing was not only timely and of good quality, but also skillfully applied according to the growth needs of the crops, so that this year's rice did not experience lodging despite the high planting density. In addition, in the implementation of a series of measures such as improved varieties, deep plowing, close planting, and field management, this year's measures were also more reasonable and perfect than last year.

In this year, the Party committees at all levels in the Suzhou Special District continuously improved their leadership methods and continuously developed mass movements. The Party committees at all levels especially attached importance to digging potential from imbalances, constantly prompting the advanced to become more advanced, the backward to catch up with the advanced and surpass the advanced, and the poor teams to catch up with the rich teams and surpass the rich teams. Jiangyin County, which won the provincial rice championship last year, achieved an average yield of 900 jin per mu on more than 800,000 mu of mid-season rice this year, and an average yield of 1,050 jin per mu on more than 60,000 mu of late rice, an increase of more than 50% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Wujiang and Kunshan counties, which have low-lying terrain and poor soil quality, have historically had grain yields that are 100 to 200 jin lower than the general level. This year, they have caught up with the advanced level, with an average annual grain yield of over 1,000 jin per mu.

Now, a winter production upsurge that is earlier and of better quality than last winter has formed in the entire district. Under the fighting goal of "rapeseed surpassing wheat, wheat catching up with rice, beans and grass (green manure) doubling, ten edges competing with large fields, producing high yields in every item, and a full house red in summer harvest," the people of the entire district are working hard and doing their best. 2.88 million mu of wheat have been universally topdressed, with an average of 161 dan of topdressing per mu. 990,000 mu of rapeseed have been topdressed with 71 dan per mu. The winter manure accumulation in the entire district has reached 640 million dan, an increase of about 50% compared to the same period last year. More than 99% of the wheat and rapeseed have been ditched for drainage, also much earlier than last year.

　　一向高产的地区完全能够持续跃进
    苏州专区农林牧副渔全面大丰收
    农副业总产值比1958年增长32.3％　粮食总产量比1958年增长25.3％
    本报南京30日电　江苏省苏州专区四百五十多万人民，在总路线的光辉照耀下，经过一年的苦干巧干，今年在农业生产战线上，又取得了比去年更大的胜利，粮、棉、油全面大丰收，农林牧副渔项项都高产。
    今年全专区农副业总产值达十亿元，比去年增加32.3％。粮食总产量比去年增加25.3％。全区三百七十万农业人口平均每人生产粮食一千五百二十斤。六十四万亩棉花平均亩产皮棉一百斤，达到了全国农业发展纲要规定的最高指标。油菜子平均亩产也比去年增产五成，花果比去年增产14％，鱼增产15％，蚕茧增产20％，猪的圈存数比去年增加28％，鸡鸭鹅也比去年增加二倍多。
    农副业生产全面跃进的结果，社员收入和公共积累相应提高，商品生产率比往年更高。到11月底，全区已超额完成国家粮食征购任务，全区农业人口平均每人出售余粮五百二十五斤。广大农民歌颂今年全面大丰收说：总路线的光芒当头照，生产生活年年高，再鼓干劲争上游，明年更比今年好。
    苏州专区取得高产更高产的基本原因，首先是各级党委不断加强政治思想工作，坚定不移地领导群众一再力争上游。去年秋种开始，就有力地批判了“潜力已挖光、措施已用尽”的消极畏难情绪，和“稳居上游”的自满麻痹思想，掀起了力争夏熟丰收的第一个高潮。接着，地委、县委负责同志抓住夏熟丰收满堂红的有利时机，以夏促秋，在全区设置了成千上万个条件相同产量不同的对立面，大破骄傲自满和甘居中游的思想，一个轰轰烈烈的秋熟超包产竞赛和稻苗升级运动，又迅速在全区展开。8月以后，又在党员干部和广大群众中深入宣传和贯彻党的八届八中全会的决议，进一步大鼓干劲，大添措施，把超包产竞赛又推向了一个新的高峰。由于群众思想的不断跃进，促进了粮食产量一季超一季。全区水稻产量节节上升，早稻平均亩产六百斤，中稻八百四十斤，晚稻又跳到九百七十八斤，并出现了双季稻后作超过前作的奇迹。
    今年苏州专区取得比去年更大的高产，是和农业技术的不断革命分不开的。苏州专区原来的水利条件虽然较好，但老河网水系零乱，有网无纲，洪涝不分，为了进一步改善水利条件，今年采取了革命的措施，开挖了浏河、望虞河、张家港等大干河，和二十一条中干河及大量的小型水利工程，并扩大机电灌溉面积一百五十万亩。全区三百八十五点四万亩水稻实现了机电灌溉，占水稻总面积73％。这样，就在今年八十多天不下雨的大旱年成，保证了稻田灌溉，创造了天旱地不旱，大旱年成水稻大丰收的奇迹。
    在肥料方面，苏州专区一向重视种植绿肥作物和沤制精肥。为了争取更大的高产，今年又发展了这些经验。全区绿肥作物面积从去年的一百三十万亩扩大到一百七十万亩，并普遍做到绿肥、河泥、猪灰和稻草混合搭配沤制草塘泥，提高了肥效，使全区五百多万亩水稻每亩有精肥一百五十多担，比去年增加20％以上。在施肥方法上，接受了去年的经验，追肥不但做到及时，质量好，而且做到根据作物生长需要适时巧施，使今年水稻在密植程度较高的情况下，没有发生倒伏现象。此外，在贯彻良种、深耕、密植、田间管理等一系列的措施中，今年也都比去年做得更加合理、更加完善。
    这一年，苏州专区各级党委不断改进领导方法，不断发展了群众运动。各级党委特别重视从不平衡中挖潜力，不断地促使先进的更先进，落后的赶先进超先进，穷队赶富队超富队。去年夺得全省水稻冠军的江阴县，今年八十多万亩中稻亩产达到九百斤，六万多亩晚稻平均亩产达到一千零五十斤，又比大跃进的1958年增产五成以上。地势低洼土质较差的吴江、昆山等县，历来粮食年产量低于一般水平一、二百斤，今年赶上了先进水平，粮食年产量平均每亩达到千斤以上。
    现在，一个比去冬行动早、质量好的冬季生产高潮已在全区形成。全区人民在“油菜超三麦，三麦赶水稻，豆、草（绿肥）翻一番，十边赛大田，项项出高产，夏熟满堂红”的奋斗目标下，大干特干。二百八十八万亩三麦已普遍追肥，平均每亩追肥一百六十一担。九十九万亩油菜，每亩已追肥七十一担。全区冬季积肥已达六亿四千万担，比去年同期增长50％左右。三麦和油菜，99％以上已挖好排水沟，也比去年大大提前。
