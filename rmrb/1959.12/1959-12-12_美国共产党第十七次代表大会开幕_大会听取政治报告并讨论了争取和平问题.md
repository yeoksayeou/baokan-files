A spokesperson for the Communist Party of the United States told reporters that the congress was being held in secret because, under the current conditions in the United States, if the names of the delegates attending the congress were published, they might be fired or subjected to other persecutions.

Hall, chairman of the congress preparatory committee, said at a press conference that the agenda of the congress included the following issues: the struggle for peace, the struggle against anti-labor legislation, the Black people's issue, and preparations for the 1960 election campaign.

The struggle for peace was discussed at the congress session on the 10th.

Hall, secretary of the Midwestern Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, delivered a political report. General Secretary of the National Committee, Dennis, was unable to attend the congress and deliver a report due to illness.

The congress also heard a report on the transition to a peaceful economy. The speaker was Lumer, secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States. Jackson, secretary for Black people and Southern affairs, gave a report on the international solidarity of the working class. The congress also began discussing these reports.

The congress received congratulatory telegrams from fraternal Communist and Workers' parties in about eighty countries, including the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China.
