Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch, Jakarta: A serious anti-Chinese campaign endangering the friendly relations between China and Indonesia has recently occurred in Indonesia. After Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio's friendly visit to China, this activity not only did not stop, but intensified. This cannot but arouse the deep concern and attention of the Chinese People.

In October of this year, Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio visited China and issued a joint communiqué with Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi on October 11. When the joint communiqué addressed the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia, it stated: "The two Foreign Ministers believe that in the process of Indonesia's economic development and stability, the economic status of overseas Chinese settled there may be affected to some extent. The two Foreign Ministers believe that appropriate methods should be found to resolve this issue in a way that is conducive to Indonesia's economic development and respects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. The two Foreign Ministers agreed that the economic strength of the overseas Chinese will continue to play a beneficial role in Indonesia's economic development." This joint communiqué of the two Foreign Ministers has been welcomed and supported by the Chinese people and the broad masses of the Indonesian people. They hope that the above-mentioned spirit announced by the two Foreign Ministers in this joint communiqué can help properly handle issues related to overseas Chinese in Indonesia.

Immediately after the Foreign Ministers of China and Indonesia issued the joint communiqué, the Indonesian core cabinet formally adopted Presidential Decree No. 10 at a meeting held on November 3, stipulating that foreign small merchants and retailers living outside the capitals of the first and second level autonomous regions and states must cease operations from January 1, 1960. On November 18, this Presidential Decree No. 10 was officially announced.

This presidential decree was formulated based on the decision made by former Indonesian Minister of Commerce, Muljomiseno, on May 14 of this year regarding the revocation of business licenses of foreign retail merchants in areas below the county level. The main target of this presidential decree is the small overseas Chinese merchants.

It should be pointed out that the Indonesian government has promulgated a series of decrees and regulations concerning foreigners over the past few years, nominally "abolishing foreign capital." In fact, it treats the imperialist corporations that monopolize the Indonesian economy, such as Mobil Oil, Texaco, and Batavia Oil Company, with reverence, not daring to touch them. It even opens the door wide for imperialist economic expansion, attracting a large amount of capital from US imperialism and Japanese militarism to infiltrate Indonesia. However, the Indonesian government is now focusing on attacking small overseas Chinese merchants, just as Indonesian Communist Party Chairman Aidit said: "They are afraid of confronting tigers, so they only beat cats."

Following the Indonesian government's passage and promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 10, the local wartime authorities in many regions of Indonesia intensified their anti-Chinese activities. They not only prohibited overseas Chinese living in small towns and villages from engaging in petty business or retail trade, but also, according to the "Regulations on Supervising the Residence and Travel of Foreigners" issued by the Indonesian Central Wartime Authorities on May 4 of this year, intensified the use of violence to force overseas Chinese and their families to abandon their houses and property and move to designated areas. The West Java military authorities have been particularly brutal in this regard.

Currently, the entire West Java province is carrying out forced relocation on a large scale below the county capital level. The West Java authorities have also dispatched a large number of troops, police, and military police, using brutal methods such as shooting, beating, and humiliation to deal with overseas Chinese, forcibly dragging sick people and pregnant women onto vehicles, closing overseas Chinese houses, forcibly moving overseas Chinese property, and requisitioning overseas Chinese schools, forcing countless overseas Chinese to become displaced, lose their schooling and jobs, and lose their livelihoods. In the past two months, the West Java authorities have also adopted terrorist methods to arrest overseas Chinese on a large scale. It is reported that more than 230 people have been arrested, and more than a dozen leaders of overseas Chinese organizations have also been arrested. The arrested overseas Chinese have been detained in a concentration camp with Indonesian rebels; some arrested overseas Chinese have even been unreasonably sentenced on charges of "resisting forced relocation." In the Ciamis Regency alone, 172 overseas Chinese have been sentenced to imprisonment. Situ Zan, chairman of the Jakarta Chinese Association, was detained by the local wartime authorities on trumped-up charges when he returned to Jakarta on November 16 after returning to China to attend the National Day celebrations. He has not been released yet.

In the past month or so, incidents of forced relocation and beatings of overseas Chinese have occurred frequently, with extremely brutal methods. On November 12, during the forced relocation in Cileungsi, the wife of overseas Chinese Liao Zhishan had just been discharged from the hospital after abdominal surgery, but the local military authorities ignored this and forcibly dragged her onto the vehicle, causing the stitches to come undone and blood to flow continuously. The anti-Chinese elements in Cibaduyut also incited everywhere, clamoring to burn and kill all the overseas Chinese. On November 30, during the forced relocation of overseas Chinese in the Rawang area of Paneglang Regency, eight overseas Chinese were injured by Indonesian soldiers, one of whom was seriously injured. On December 1, dozens of military police went to Cilamaya at night to force overseas Chinese to move. After arriving there, they rushed into the homes of overseas Chinese and beat them behind closed doors. The entire family of overseas Chinese Lai Yuelong and Xiao Yulin were beaten, and Xiao Yulin was knocked unconscious. His daughter was molested by an Indonesian military officer, and his son was beaten for protesting. Lin Congfang, an overseas Chinese in his sixties, was brutally beaten by Indonesian military police. His son was beaten unconscious when he stepped forward to stop them. Then, these military police raised him high and threw him to the ground, causing him serious injuries and putting his life in danger.

At the same time, the authorities in South and Southeast Sulawesi, East Kalimantan, South Sumatra, and Jambi have also successively ordered that foreigners be prohibited from living outside the cities where the county governments are located within a specified time limit.

The overseas Chinese small merchants and retailers who live in small towns and villages in Indonesia are all individual commercial laborers. The vast majority are husband and wife or brothers running shops with meager capital. They have always been law-abiding, hardworking, and have played an undeniable and positive role in Indonesia's economic life, especially in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Once their business licenses are revoked and they are forced to relocate, not only will hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese small merchants immediately be reduced to a state of destitution, but it will also have an adverse impact on the economic life of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian "Awakening Weekly" once pointed out that more than 90% of the foreigners living in rural areas and small towns in Indonesia are overseas Chinese. "Obviously, the measure prohibiting all foreigners from living in rural areas and small towns affects the survival of overseas Chinese in Indonesia more seriously than any previous regulations and laws related to foreigners promulgated by the government."

It is worth noting that after the joint communiqué of the Foreign Ministers of China and Indonesia was issued, some newspapers in Indonesia also published remarks with ulterior motives to incite further anti-Chinese sentiment and aimed at undermining the traditional friendship between China and Indonesia. The "Indonesia Archipelago Daily" published editorials and articles one after another, slandering China for "carrying out aggression" and inciting the Malay people to resist the so-called "arrogance and chauvinism of the Han people," and even published cartoons insulting Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. In a commentary on November 4, the "Abadi Daily" openly incited people not to respect the joint communiqué issued by the Foreign Ministers of China and Indonesia.

From September to October of this year, incidents of Indonesian military forces forcibly requisitioning overseas Chinese schools continued to occur in Manado, Pekanbaru, Langga Lawe and other places. In addition, some local authorities in Indonesia continue to persecute impoverished overseas Chinese by forcibly collecting high foreign taxes.

The series of anti-Chinese measures by the Indonesian government has aroused unease and indignation among the broad masses of overseas Chinese. Local overseas Chinese have requested the Indonesian government to respect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, abolish the decrees aimed at excluding Chinese, and stop the anti-Chinese campaign. In areas where the Indonesian authorities are carrying out forced relocation, the broad masses of overseas Chinese, facing displacement and loss of livelihood, have been forced to spontaneously take self-defense measures. Despite the extremely rude and unreasonable means adopted by the Indonesian military police during the forced relocation, the overseas Chinese patiently reasoned and negotiated with the Indonesian authorities, demanding an end to this forced relocation that harms the friendly relations between the two peoples. The tragic situation of the overseas Chinese being persecuted and their self-defense actions to protect their right to survival have received widespread sympathy and support from the Indonesian people. In some places, when military police forced overseas Chinese to relocate, Indonesian rickshaw pullers who were ordered to carry out the moving refused to move. Many Indonesians shed tears because they saw the barbaric acts of the military police forcing overseas Chinese to relocate. In some places, due to the forced relocation of overseas Chinese small merchants, it has had an adverse impact on the local economic life, and prices have risen. Therefore, many Indonesians have taken the initiative to invite the forced relocation of overseas Chinese small merchants to return to continue operating.

Farsighted Indonesian public opinion also opposes anti-Chinese activities. They have requested the Indonesian authorities to reconsider this issue based on the principles of the Bandung Conference and the true national interests of Indonesia. The Indonesian National Business Institutions initially asked the former Minister of Commerce to withdraw his decision. Suprapto, the secretary-general and spokesperson of this institution, said: "It has now been proven that it is not hundreds of people but millions of Indonesian people who disapprove of the Minister of Commerce's decision." The "Eastern Star News" pointed out that "the competition that hinders the development of (Indonesian) national industry and commerce comes from foreign monopoly capital enterprises or foreign large capital enterprises, not from those retailers in districts and townships".

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement on the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia on November 22, calling for vigilance against the conspiracy of US imperialism and its servants to undermine the friendly relations between Indonesia and China, and advocating that the overseas Chinese issue be resolved based on Indonesian President Sukarno's political manifesto and the Subandrio-Chen Yi joint communiqué, in the spirit of Indonesian-Chinese friendship and through actions to strive for Indonesian-Chinese friendship.

The Indonesian "Eastern Star News," "Republic Daily," "Dawn Daily," "People's Daily," and some people who cherish Chinese-Indonesian friendship have expressed concern about the anti-Chinese activities taking place in this country, calling for vigilance against the imperialist plot of incitement, and demanding that the overseas Chinese issue be resolved between China and Indonesia in accordance with the principles of the Bandung Conference and through friendly consultation.

The anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia have been incited by a handful of reactionary forces with ulterior motives under the planning of US imperialism. It does not conform to the interests of Indonesia, let alone the wishes of the people, but only conforms to the will and demands of US imperialism, which attempts to create division and disputes in Asia.

According to Antara News Agency on the 5th, Indonesian Ambassador to the United States, Mukarto, told Indonesian reporters in Washington that the Indonesian government's practice of prohibiting overseas Chinese small merchants in rural areas and small towns "was welcomed by official and non-official people in the United States."

The Jakarta correspondent of the British "Scotsman" said in an article about anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia under the name of "xenophobia" that "Americans even show some signs of happiness at this 'xenophobic' movement. Because this movement is mainly aimed at overseas Chinese."

    反动势力在美帝国主义策划下煽风点火
    印度尼西亚掀起严重排华活动
    战时掌权者使用军队和暴力迫害华侨断绝华侨的生计
    公众舆论呼吁珍视友谊和本国经济利益取消排华法令
    新华社11日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚最近发生了严重危害中国和印度尼西亚友好关系的排华活动。在印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约对中国进行友好访问后，这一活动不仅没有收敛，反而变本加厉。这不能不引起中国人民的深切关怀和注意。
    今年10月，印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约访问了中国，并且同中国外交部长陈毅在10月11日发表了一项联合公报。联合公报谈到在印度尼西亚的华侨的问题时说：“两国外交部长认为，在印度尼西亚经济发展和稳定的过程中，定居在那里的华侨的经济地位可能将受到某种影响。两国外交部长认为，应该寻找适当的方法使这个问题的解决有利于印度尼西亚经济的发展和使华侨的正当权利和利益受到尊重。两国外交部长同意，华侨的经济力量将仍然对于印度尼西亚的经济发展起有益的作用。”两国外交部长的这项联合公报受到中国人民和印度尼西亚广大人民的欢迎和支持。他们希望两国外交部长在这项联合公报中宣布的上述精神能够有助于妥善处理有关在印度尼西亚的华侨的问题。
    就在中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长发表了联合公报以后，印度尼西亚核心内阁在11月3日举行的会议上正式通过了总统第十号法令，规定住在第一级和第二级自治区和州的首府以外的外侨小商贩和零售商从1960年1月1日起必须停业。11月18日，这项第十号总统法令被正式公布。
    这项总统法令是根据前印度尼西亚商业部长穆耳约米森诺在今年5月14日颁布的关于吊销县级以下地区外侨零售商营业执照的决定而制定的。由于这项总统法令的颁布而受到沉重打击的，主要是华侨小商贩。
    应该指出：印度尼西亚政府几年来颁布了一系列有关外侨的法令条例，名义上说是“取缔外国资本”，事实上，对垄断印度尼西亚经济的帝国主义大企业如美孚油公司、德士古石油公司、巴达维亚石油公司等，却敬若鬼神，不敢触动，甚至还为帝国主义的扩大经济侵略敞开大门，引贼入室，大量招揽美帝国主义和日本军国主义的资本渗入印度尼西亚。而现在，印度尼西亚政府却集中攻击华侨小商贩，诚如印度尼西亚共产党主席艾地所说的：“他们由于害怕对抗老虎而只去打猫”。
    随着印度尼西亚政府通过和公布总统第十号法令后，印度尼西亚许多地区的地方战时掌权者变本加厉地展开了排华活动。他们不仅禁止住在小市镇和乡村的华侨经营小生意或零售贸易，并且根据印度尼西亚中央战时掌权者在今年5月4日颁布的“监督外侨居住和旅行条例”，加紧用暴力强迫华侨和他们的家属舍弃他们的房屋和财物，搬到指定的地区。在这方面，西爪哇军事当局做得特别凶暴。
    目前整个西爪哇省都在县首府以下地区大规模地疯狂地进行武力迫迁。西爪哇当局还出动了大批军队、警察、宪兵，以鸣枪、毒打、凌辱的残暴手段对付华侨，强拖病人、孕妇上车，封闭华侨房屋、强搬华侨财产、征用华侨学校，逼使无数华侨流离失所，失学失业，丧失生计。近两个月来，西爪哇当局还采取了恐怖手段大规模逮捕华侨。据悉被捕者已超过二百三十多名，同时还逮捕了十余名侨团领导人，并将被捕的华侨同印度尼西亚的叛乱分子扣押在一个集中营里；甚至对被捕的华侨加以“抗拒迫迁”的罪名无理判刑。仅在尖美士县就已经有一百七十二名华侨被判徒刑。雅加达中华侨团总会主席司徒赞在回国参加国庆观礼后，于11月16日返抵雅加达时，即遭当地战时掌权者以莫须有的罪名加以扣押。至今仍未释放。
    最近一个多月来，迫迁殴打华侨事件层出不穷，手段异常残暴。11月12日，在芝灵诗武力迫迁时，华侨廖志善的妻子腹部开刀刚出院，当地军方也置之不顾，把她强拖上车，致使伤口缝线脱落，血流不止。芝巴德的排华分子还到处煽动，叫嚣要将华侨烧光、杀光。11月30日，在板宜格冷县拉挽地区迫迁华侨过程中，有八名华侨被印度尼西亚军人打伤，其中一人伤势严重。12月1日，数十名军警到加拉横县芝拉马夜强迫华侨迁移。他们到达那里后，即冲进华侨住家，闭门围殴华侨。华侨赖跃龙和萧玉粦等全家老少被打，萧玉粦被打晕倒在地。他的女儿受到一名印度尼西亚军官的调戏，他的儿子表示抗议，也遭到毒打。六十多岁的华侨林聪访被印度尼西亚军警毒打，他的儿子上前阻拦，也被打得不省人事，随后，这些军警还把他高高抬起，抛摔地上，使他身受重伤，生命垂危。
    与此同时，南和东南苏拉威西、东加里曼丹、南苏门答腊和占碑当局也已经先后下令限期禁止外侨居住在县政府所在地的城市以外地区。
    在印度尼西亚小市镇和乡村定居的华侨小商贩都是个体商业劳动者，绝大多数是夫妻兄弟店，资金微薄，一向安分守法，辛勤经营，在印度尼西亚的经济生活中，特别是城乡物资交流中，起着不可否认的一定的积极作用。一旦吊销了营业执照和迫使他们迁居，不仅使数十万华侨小商贩立即陷于无以为生的境地，而且对印度尼西亚人民的经济生活带来不利的影响。印度尼西亚“觉醒周刊”曾经指出，居住在印度尼西亚的农村和小市镇的外侨，有90％以上是华侨。“显然，禁止所有外侨在农村和小市镇居住的措施，比历来政府颁布过的任何有关外侨的条例与法令，更加严重地影响到华侨在印度尼西亚的生存。”
    值得注意的是，在中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长的联合公报发表以后，印度尼西亚的一些报纸却也发出别有用心的煽动进一步排华和目的显然在于破坏中国和印度尼西亚之间传统友谊的言论。“印度尼西亚群岛报”连篇累牍地刊登社论、文章，诽谤中国“进行侵略”，煽动马来民族起来抵抗所谓“汉族的傲慢及其沙文主义”，甚至刊登侮辱中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席的漫画。而“永恒日报”在11月4日的评论中，竟公然煽动不要尊重中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长发表的联合公报。
    今年9月至10月，在万鸦佬、北干巴鲁、浪牙捞等地不断发生印度尼西亚军方强迫征用华侨学校的事件。此外，印度尼西亚的某些地方当局还继续以强征高额外侨税的手段来迫害贫苦华侨。
    印度尼西亚政府的一系列排华措施激起广大华侨的不安和愤慨。当地华侨纷纷要求印度尼西亚政府尊重华侨的正当权利和利益，取消旨在排华的法令，停止排华。在印度尼西亚当局进行迫迁的地区，广大华侨在面临流离失所、生计断绝的局面下，被迫起来自发地采取自卫措施。尽管印度尼西亚军警、宪兵在迫迁中采取了极其粗暴蛮横的手段，华侨还是耐心地向印度尼西亚当局说理交涉，要求停止这种危害两国人民友好关系的迫迁行动。华侨受迫害的悲惨处境和为保卫生存权利的自卫行为，得到了印度尼西亚人民广泛的同情和支持。在有些地方，当军警迫迁华侨时，奉命担任搬运工作的印度尼西亚三轮车工人拒绝搬运，有很多印度尼西亚人因为看到军警迫迁华侨的野蛮行为而落泪。有些地方，由于华侨小商贩的被迫迁，对当地经济生活产生了不利的影响，物价高涨，因而，不少地方的印度尼西亚人都主动地来邀请被迫迁的华侨小商贩回去继续营业。
    有远见的印度尼西亚公众和舆论也反对排华活动。他们要求印度尼西亚当局根据万隆会议的原则和印度尼西亚的真正民族利益来重新考虑这个问题。印度尼西亚民族企业联合机构在当初就要求前商业部长撤回他的决定。这个机构的秘书长兼发言人苏普拉普托说：“目前已经证明，不赞成商业部长的决定的，不是数百人而是成百万的印度尼西亚民众。”“东星报”指出，“妨碍（印度尼西亚）民族工商业发展的竞争，是来自外国垄断资本企业或外国大资本企业，并不是来自区、乡的那些零售商”。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局在11月22日就印度尼西亚的华侨问题发表声明，呼吁警惕美帝国主义和它的仆从破坏印度尼西亚和中国之间的友好关系的阴谋，并且主张根据印度尼西亚总统苏加诺的政治宣言和苏班德里约—陈毅联合公报，本着印度尼西亚—中国友好的精神和通过争取印度尼西亚—中国友好的行动来解决华侨问题。
    印度尼西亚的“东星报”、“共和国报”、“黎明日报”、“人民日报”和一些珍重中国—印度尼西亚友好关系的人士，对在这个国家中发生的排华活动表示忧虑，呼吁警惕帝国主义的挑拨阴谋，并且要求在中国和印度尼西亚之间按照万隆会议的原则和通过友好协商的途径，来解决华侨问题。
    印度尼西亚的排华活动是一部分别有用心的反动势力，在美帝国主义策划下煽动起来的。它并不符合印度尼西亚的利益，更违反了人民的愿望，而只符合企图在亚洲制造分裂和争端的美帝国主义的意志和要求。
    据安塔拉通讯社5日报道，印度尼西亚驻美国大使慕加多在华盛顿对印度尼西亚记者说，印度尼西亚政府禁止乡村和小市镇的华侨小商贩的做法，“受到美国官方和非官方人士的欢迎”。
    英国“苏格兰人报”的雅加达特派记者在一篇关于印度尼西亚的以“排外”为名进行排华活动的文章中说，“美国人对这种‘排外’运动甚至表现出某种高兴的迹象。因为这个运动主要是针对华侨的”。
