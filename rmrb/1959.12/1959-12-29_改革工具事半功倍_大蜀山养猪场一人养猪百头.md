　　Reforming Tools Doubles the Effect
    ——Da Shu Mountain Pig Farm: One Person Raises 100 Pigs
　　By our reporter Han Guozhen
　　Cooking Feed with Methane, Gravity-Fed Water, Automated Feeding

    Da Shu Mountain Pig Farm in the suburbs of Hefei, Anhui Province, has recently undergone a major technical innovation, and the pig farm has taken on a completely new look. Now, they have achieved methane gas for cooking feed, gravity-fed water, and automated feeding, and the number of pigs raised per keeper has increased from the original 25 to 100 to 120.

    When the reporter entered the pig farm, the first thing that caught the eye was the tall, earthen, self-made water tower standing in the center of the farm. The well water below the tower flows into the water storage tower with the rotation of the foot-pedaled vertical closed water wheel, and then flows to various feed stoves and pig troughs through bamboo pipes. The construction of this earthen water tower fully meets the needs of the entire farm of more than 6,000 pigs for drinking water and feed preparation.

    We visited the feeding room in the new-style pigsty. Here, each operation, from cooking feed to cleaning pig troughs, is linked in an orderly manner. On the stove made of earthen bricks are two rubber tubes filled with methane gas, one end of the tube going directly to the bottom of the methane stove. Near the stove is a feed pool, and the cooked feed automatically flows into the feed pool; at the other end of the pool is a hatch, and if the hatch is opened, the feed is evenly sent into the pig trough through an automatic feeding trough. Here, the entire operation process from feed processing, feed delivery, to washing the pig troughs after feeding, has been automated. As long as one feeder operates it, the work that originally required four feeders to complete in six hours can be completed in more than two hours.

    The benefits of reforming breeding tools are most deeply felt by the breeders. Model breeder Hu Zhangzhen has been working hard and responsibly since she entered the pig farm as a breeder in 1957. However, no matter how hard she worked, she could only feed a maximum of 25 pigs. For the past few years, she always got up before dawn to carry water, release the pigs, and clean the pigsty, and had to work until the pigs fell asleep at night before she could rest. What she found most difficult was carrying water and burning wood to cook feed on rainy days. The roads were slippery when it rained, and it took a lot of time to carry water; when she couldn't buy dry firewood, it took three hours to cook a pot of feed. After the feed was cooked, feeding the pigs was also a hassle, because the old trough was small, and the 25 pigs had to be fed in three batches. In this way, Hu Zhangzhen had to squeeze in time to release the pigs and clean the pigsty in addition to feeding two meals a day.

    When the pig farm began to reform breeding tools, Hu Zhangzhen took the lead in participating. Now she has moved into the feeder's dormitory in the new-style pigsty and is responsible for feeding 100 large fattening pigs alone. The work of carrying water, which used to take the most time and labor, now only requires her to unplug the wooden plug of the earthen tap water pipe, and the water flows into the pot and pig trough. What she used to worry most about was cooking feed, but now she only needs to strike a match, and the vigorous methane flame will cook the feed for 100 pigs in half an hour. Although the number of pigs Hu Zhangzhen now raises is equivalent to the amount of pigs raised by four people in the past, she can still spare three hours a day to do housework and other work, and the pigsty is cleaned even more cleanly.

    After Da Shu Mountain Pig Farm realized methane gas for cooking feed, gravity-fed water, and automated feeding, every 400 pigs can save more than 360 yuan in fuel costs. At the same time, because the amount of labor has been reduced, the breeders pay more attention to improving the quality of breeding. For example, as the weather gradually cools down, the breeders take the method of feeding cooked food warm to increase the body temperature of the pigs. They also proposed to make the pen clean and the nest warm, to change the bedding grass frequently, disinfect it every ten days, and rinse the pig trough with boiling water every three days and other positive measures. Thanks to the careful care of the breeders, the pigs are fed very well, and there are few illnesses. The survival rate of piglets has also been greatly improved, reaching more than 95%.

　　改革工具事半功倍
    ——大蜀山养猪场一人养猪百头
　　本报记者　韩国珍
　　煮料沼气化  用水自流化  送食自动化
    安徽省合肥郊区大蜀山养猪场，最近一段期间大闹技术革新，猪场已经面貌一新。现在，他们做到了煮料沼气化、用水自流化、送食自动化，饲养员已由原来每人养猪二十五头增加到一百头至一百二十头。
    当记者走进猪场时，首先引人注目的，便是那耸立在猪场中央的高高的土自来水塔。水塔下面的井水，随着脚踏立式封闭水车的转动，流入盛水塔，然后通过一根根的毛竹管，流向各个饲料锅灶和猪槽。这座土自来水塔的建造，完全满足了全场六千多头猪的食用水的需要。
    我们参观了新式猪舍内的饲养房。这里从煮饲料到清洗猪槽的各个操作过程，都有条不紊地联系着。用土砖砌成的灶台上，放着两根盛有沼气的橡皮管，皮管的一头一直通向沼气灶锅底。靠近灶边有一口饲料池，煮过的饲料自动地淌入饲料池内；池子的另一端有活门，若将活门打开，饲料便通过自动送食槽均匀地送进猪槽。这里，从饲料加工、送饲料、到喂完猪冲洗猪槽的整个操作过程，都已达到了自动化。只要一个饲养员操作，在两个多小时内便完成原来需要四个饲养员在六个小时内才能完成的工作。
    改革饲养工具的好处，感受最深的要算饲养员了。模范饲养员胡章珍从1957年进猪场当饲养员以来，一直是起早睡晚，积极负责。可是，任她再吃苦、肯干，最多也只喂二十五头。几年来，她总是天不亮便起床担水、放猪、打扫猪圈，一直要忙到晚上猪睡倒以后才能休息。最使她感到困难的是下雨天挑水和烧锅煮饲料。雨路滑，挑水要花去很多时间；在买不着干柴时，煮一锅饲料也得花去三个小时。饲料煮好后，喂猪也是麻烦事，因为旧槽小，二十五头猪还得分作三批喂。这样，胡章珍一天除了忙着喂两顿饲料外，连放猪、打扫猪圈也得挤时间。
    当猪场开始搞饲养工具改革时，胡章珍首先带头参加。现在她已搬进了新式猪舍里的饲养员的宿舍，一个人担负起喂养一百头大肥猪的任务。以往花时间最多、劳动强度最大的挑水工作，现在她只要拔开土自来水管的木塞，水就流进锅里和猪槽里了。原来她最发愁的是煮饲料，现在也只要擦一根火柴，旺盛的沼气火苗，在半个多小时内就把一百头猪的饲料煮熟了。现在胡章珍饲养的猪虽然等于以往四个人的养猪量，但她每天还可抽出三个小时做做家务事和其他工作，猪舍打扫得更是干净。
    大蜀山养猪场实现煮料沼气化、用水自流化、送食自动化的办法以后，每四百头猪就可节省燃料费三百六十多元。同时，因为减轻了劳动量，饲养员们更加注意提高饲养质量。例如天气渐渐冷下来，饲养员们就采取熟食暖喂的办法，来增加猪的体温。他们还提出了要使圈内清洁窝暖和，做到勤换铺草，十天消毒一次，以及每三天用开水冲刷猪槽等积极措施。由于饲养员的精心照料，猪都喂得很好，很少有发病现象，仔猪成活率也大大提高，达到了95％以上。
