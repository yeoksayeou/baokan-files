Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 24th: TASS reports: After hearing reports from representatives of Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the 23rd proceeded to discuss reports from representatives of seven Union Republics.

　　Those who spoke at the meeting on the 23rd included A. Larionov, First Secretary of the Ryazan Oblast Committee of the CPSU, Kirilenko, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and First Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Committee of the CPSU, Kunaev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Kazakhstan, and Zasiadko, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

　　The representatives attending the meeting were very interested in the speech of A. Larionov. He said that Ryazan Oblast increased meat production by 2.8 times in 1959 and sold 150,000 tons of meat to the state, twice as much as last year.

　　Larionov said that the agricultural workers of Ryazan Oblast have decided to complete three years' worth of tasks in selling meat to the state in 1960. They also intend to complete the seven-year plan for livestock product output in three years.

　　He said that the collective farm led by T. Yefremova, a Hero of Socialist Labor who attended this plenary session, produced 173 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of land this year. The average level in Ryazan Oblast is 53.2 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of land.

　　He pointed out that the increase in livestock product productivity is primarily due to corn. Corn has ensured feed for livestock, increasing milk yield per cow by about one and a half times. Milk production in collective farms has increased fourfold in the past five years.

　　Tretyakov, Chairman of the Kirov Collective Farm in Krasnodar Krai, said that the Kirov Collective Farm produced 73 quintals of meat (slaughter weight) per 100 hectares of land this year, more than double the increase from last year; it produced 223 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of land. The farm harvested a total of 25,000 tons of grain this year.

　　He said that due to the increase in farm income, the collective farm was able to allocate one-third of its total income as a public accumulation fund.

　　The morning session on the 24th continued to discuss the reports of representatives from the seven republics.

　　Mzhavanadze, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia, pointed out in his speech during the discussion that this plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee marks a new stage in the development of the entire Soviet socialist economy.

　　He said that Georgia—the main tea-producing area of the Soviet Union—has greatly increased its tea production. Chkhaidze and some other female farmers set a world record for tea picking. She picked 165 quintals of tea per hectare.

　　Georgian tea farmers have decided to reach the 1965 planned level—picking 170,000 tons of tea—by 1963.

　　Kabanets, Chairman of the "Red Peasant" Collective Farm, an advanced farm in Ukraine, said that the members of this farm have decided to help the neighboring "Harvest Day" Collective Farm eliminate its backwardness in milk and meat production in order to achieve a general upsurge in agriculture.

　　Kabanets said that the collective farm he leads increased meat production by five times and milk production by six times this year compared to 1953.

　　Rybachok, a female farmer from Stalingrad Oblast, pointed out at the meeting that she handed over the group of high-yielding dairy cows she managed to another milkmaid and took over a group of low-yielding dairy cows, aiming to increase the milk yield of each cow to no less than 6,000 kilograms.

　　梁赞州代表在苏共中央全会上提出豪迈目标
    争取三年完成七年畜产品计划
    “红色农民”农庄决定帮助毗邻提高肉类生产
    新华社莫斯科24日电　据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议23日听取了塔吉克和阿塞拜疆代表的报告后，接着对七个加盟共和国代表的报告进行讨论。
    在23日会议上发言的有苏共梁赞州委第一书记阿·拉里昂诺夫，苏共中央主席团候补委员、苏共斯维德洛夫斯克州委第一书记基里连科、哈萨克部长会议主席库纳耶夫、苏联部长会议副主席扎夏迪科等人。
    出席会议的代表对阿·拉里昂诺夫的发言很感兴趣。他说，梁赞州1959年的肉类生产增加了二点八倍，并且向国家交售了十五万吨肉类，比去年增加了两倍。
    拉里昂诺夫说，梁赞州的农业劳动者决定，在1960年在向国家交售肉类方面完成三年的任务。他们还打算在三年内完成在畜产品产量方面的七年计划。
    他说，出席这次全会的社会主义劳动英雄塔·叶弗列莫娃领导的集体农庄，今年在每一百公顷土地面积上生产一百七十三公担肉类。而梁赞州的平均水平是每一百公顷土地产肉五十三点二公担。
    他指出，畜产品生产率的提高，首先要归功于玉蜀黍。玉蜀黍保证了牲畜的饲料，使每头奶牛的挤奶量增加了一倍半左右。集体农庄的奶类生产过去五年中增加了四倍。
    克拉斯诺达边疆区基洛夫集体农庄主席特列季雅科夫说，今年基洛夫集体农庄在每一百公顷土地上生产了七十三公担肉类（屠宰重量），比去年增产一倍多；在每百公顷土地上生产了二百二十三公担牛奶。今年农庄共收获了两万五千吨粮食。
    他说，由于农庄收入的增加，集体农庄有可能把总收入的三分之一作为公积金。
    24日上午会议继续讨论七个共和国代表的报告。
    格鲁吉亚共产党中央委员会第一书记姆日阿瓦纳泽在讨论中发言时指出，这次苏共中央全会标志着整个苏联社会主义经济发展的新阶段。
    他说，格鲁吉亚——苏联主要产茶区——大大地增加了茶的产量。奇哈伊德泽和其他一些女庄员创造了采茶世界纪录。她在一公顷面积上采茶一百六十五公担。
    格鲁吉亚茶农决定要在1963年达到1965年计划的水平——采茶十七万吨。
    乌克兰的先进农庄“红色农民”集体农庄主席卡巴涅茨说，这个农庄的庄员们决定帮助毗邻的“收获日”集体农庄消除奶类和肉类生产方面的落后现象，以达到农业的普遍高涨。
    卡巴涅茨说，他所领导的集体农庄，今年的肉类生产比1953年增长了五倍，奶类生产增长了六倍。
    斯大林格勒州的女庄员雷巴乔克在会上指出，她把自己管的一群高产奶牛交给另一个挤奶女工，而去接管一群低产奶牛，要使每条奶牛的挤奶量不低于六千公斤。
