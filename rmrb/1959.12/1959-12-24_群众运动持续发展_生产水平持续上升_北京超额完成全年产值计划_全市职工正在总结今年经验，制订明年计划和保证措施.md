Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Beijing's industrial gross output value plan for this year was completed twenty-one days ahead of schedule on the 10th of this month. As of the 20th of this month, the city's metallurgy, coal, power, machinery, chemical, building materials, textile and other industries, and nine hundred and ten large and small factories and mines, have all completed the state plan ahead of schedule and exceeded it. Their total output value completed has exceeded the state plan by 4%. The output of various major industrial products has greatly increased compared with last year, with steel, steel products, and pig iron increasing by more than 50%, and coal increasing by more than 40%.

The biggest characteristic of Beijing's industrial front this year is the sustained and comprehensive leap forward. In addition to the substantial increase in output value and output, the cost of comparable products in the first eleven months of this year decreased by 7.2% compared with the same period last year, and labor productivity increased by more than 20% compared with last year. Product quality has also improved significantly. The average pass rate of converter steel in the city was 95.19% in January, and it has increased to an average of 98.03% in November. There has also been a large increase in the variety of industrial products. The metallurgical industry could only refine and trial-produce ordinary steel and six kinds of alloy steel last year, and this year it has trial-produced and produced sixty-four kinds of alloy steel. There were two hundred and forty-one kinds of knitted goods last year, and this year four hundred and eighty kinds were trial-produced and produced. The variety of electron tubes has increased by 1.3 times compared with last year. This year, some new products that could not be produced in the past were also produced, such as large machine tools, large and ultra-small electron tubes, vacuum pumps, polyvinyl chloride, hydrochloric acid, liquid chlorine, ammonium bicarbonate, and synthetic fibers.

The glorious achievements on the capital's industrial front this year are mainly the result of resolutely implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and vigorously carrying out mass movements under the Party's centralized and unified leadership. The mass movement that flourished during the Great Leap Forward last year has seen new development this year. Its main features are:

First, under the guidance of the idea of ​​continuous revolution, the mass movement has continued to develop, with one upsurge following another from the beginning of the year to the end. Especially after August, encouraged by the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and after opposing rightist tendencies and encouraging hard work, the mass movement became more extensive, in-depth, and continuously improved. Therefore, it promoted the monthly increase in production. The city's total industrial output value increased by 19% in August compared with July, and 24% in September compared with August; In October, the power supply was insufficient, but it still increased by 7% compared with September, and by 17% in November compared with October.

Second, technological innovation and technological revolution have become the central content of the mass movement. Throughout the city, from small and medium-sized factories mainly based on manual operation to modern large factories, the vast number of workers in all industries have realized a large number of technological innovation proposals aimed at key production problems and weak links. The workers of ninety-three factories in Xicheng District alone realized nine thousand eight hundred and seventy-two innovation proposals in November. After the National Congress of Heroes, the work of promoting advanced experience was launched on a large scale throughout the city, enabling many major national advanced experiences to blossom and bear fruit everywhere.

Third, the socialist labor competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward" has become a social atmosphere, and has gradually formed a complete set of competition systems for implementing the general line. The vast number of workers learn from each other and improve together through various lively competition forms such as pace-setter competitions, opponent competitions, performance competitions, and one-stop collaboration competitions. In addition, the advanced working methods such as on-site meetings, exhibitions, and inspections and evaluations created by the masses in the Great Leap Forward last year have also been greatly developed after being used extensively, universally, and regularly this year.

Such a vigorous and down-to-earth mass movement has greatly improved the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers, guided people to demand the highest standards of themselves, and made production appear in a new situation of continuous and comprehensive leap forward. At present, the workers of the city's factories and mines are holding workers' representative meetings one after another, summarizing the experience of this year's comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and discussing and formulating next year's production plans and specific guarantee measures.

### 群众运动持续发展　生产水平持续上升  北京超额完成全年产值计划  全市职工正在总结今年经验，制订明年计划和保证措施

　　群众运动持续发展　生产水平持续上升
    北京超额完成全年产值计划
    全市职工正在总结今年经验，制订明年计划和保证措施
    新华社23日讯　北京今年的工业总产值计划已提前二十一天在本月10日完成。到本月20日为止，全市冶金、煤炭、电力、机械、化工、建筑材料、纺织等行业和九百一十个大小厂矿企业，都分别提前超额完成了国家计划，它们已完成的总产值比国家计划超额了4％。各种主要工业产品的产量都比去年有很大增长，其中钢、钢材和生铁增长50％以上，煤炭增长40％以上。
    今年北京工业战线上的最大特点是持续全面跃进。除了产值产量大幅度增长外，今年前十一个月可比产品的成本，比去年同期降低了7.2％，劳动生产率比去年提高20％以上；产品质量也有显著提高，全市转炉钢的合格率1月份平均为95.19％，11月份已平均提高到98.03％。工业产品的品种也有很大的增加。冶金工业去年还只能炼制、试制普通钢和六种合金钢，今年试制和生产了六十四种合金钢。针织品去年有二百四十一种，今年试制和生产了四百八十种。电子管品种比去年增长一点三倍。今年还生产了一些过去不能生产的新产品，如大型机床、大型和超小型电子管、真空泵、聚氯乙烯、盐酸、液氯、碳酸氢氨、合成纤维等。
  今年首都工业战线上取得这样辉煌的成就，主要是坚决贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线，在党的集中统一领导下大搞群众运动的结果。去年大跃进中蓬勃开展起来的群众运动，今年有了新的发展，它的主要特点是：
    第一，在不断革命的思想指导下，群众运动持续发展，从年初到年底，一个高潮紧接着一个高潮。特别是8月以后，在党的八届八中全会号召的鼓舞下，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，群众运动更加广泛深入和不断提高。因此，促进了生产的逐月上升，全市工业总产值8月比7月增长19％，9月比8月增长24％；10月份电力供应不足，但是仍然比9月增长7％，11月比10月又增长17％。
    第二，技术革新和技术革命成为群众运动的中心内容。全市从以手工操作为主的中、小工厂到现代化的大工厂，行行业业的广大职工，针对生产关键问题和薄弱环节实现了大量技术革新建议。仅西城区九十三个工厂的职工，在11月份就实现了九千八百七十二件革新建议。全国群英会以后，推广先进经验的工作又在全市大规模展开，使许多全国重大的先进经验遍地开花结果。
    第三，“比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进”的社会主义劳动竞赛，已经成为一种社会风气，并且逐步形成为贯彻执行总路线的一整套竞赛制度。广大职工通过标兵赛、对手赛、表演赛、一条龙协作赛等多种生动活泼的竞赛形式，互相学习，共同提高。另外，去年大跃进中群众创造的现场会议、展览会、检查评比等先进的工作方法，经过今年大量、普遍、经常的运用，也得到了许多新的发展。
    这样一个既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实的群众运动，极大地提高了广大职工群众的阶级觉悟，引导着人们用最高标准要求自己，使生产出现了一个不断全面跃进的新局面。目前，全市厂矿企业的职工正在陆续召开职工代表会议，总结今年全面大跃进的经验，并且讨论和制订明年的生产计划和具体保证措施。（附图片）
