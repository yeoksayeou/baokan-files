Xinhua News Agency, December 27th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today in "Akahata," calling on the Japanese people to fight against the tyrannical acts of the Japanese traitorous and reactionary forces in undermining the constitution to force reactionary laws through the Diet.

　　The statement strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party for unilaterally forcing deliberation and passage of a law prohibiting demonstrations and marches around the Diet building at a meeting of the House of Representatives on the 24th. The statement said that this is a tyrannical act unprecedented in the history of the Japanese Diet, even during the era of the pre-war "Imperial Diet." Shamelessly forcing through reactionary laws that violate the Constitution and restrict the people's freedom of assembly and expression of will are tactics commonly used by fascist bandits.

　　The statement said that the Japanese Communist Party strongly protests against this tyrannical act by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, and will, together with the Japanese people, fight to the end to prevent this law from being passed in the House of Councillors.

　　The statement revealed that the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party and other Japanese traitorous and reactionary forces is clearly an attempt to gradually revive militaristic police politics while revising the "Security Treaty."

　　Therefore, before maliciously amending the Constitution, they conspire to create a fait accompli, openly trample on the Constitution's provisions for peace and democracy, and suppress the movement centered on the working class to strive for peace and democracy.

　　The statement emphasized that the Japanese people will absolutely not allow this reactionary conspiracy to succeed. At present, the unity of the working class and the Japanese people in striving for peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, and the protection of their livelihood rights is being strengthened daily, and their struggle is developing. Only by further strengthening this unity and launching struggles can we prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty," and prevent further destruction of the Constitution by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: An emergency meeting held today by the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party believes that the Liberal Democratic Party's unilateral passage of a law prohibiting demonstrations and marches around the Diet building in the House of Representatives yesterday is a manifestation of one-party dictatorship.

　　The Socialist Party believes that House of Representatives Speaker Ryogoro Kato should bear major responsibility for this matter. Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki and Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma lodged a protest with Ryogoro Kato today regarding the Liberal Democratic Party's barbarous behavior.

　　The Socialist Party decided that if Speaker Kato cannot give a satisfactory answer, it will refuse to participate in the deliberations of the various committees of the House of Representatives.

　　House of Representatives Vice-Speaker Kiyoshi Masaki (originally a Socialist Party member) resigned today to protest the arbitrary actions of the Liberal Democratic Party and Ryogoro Kato in the House of Representatives.

　　The Socialist Party's Diet Policy Committee decided today that the Socialist Party will submit a motion tomorrow demanding the dissolution of the House of Representatives.

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 26th, Tokyo Dispatch: Saburo Eda, Director of the Organization Bureau of the Japanese Socialist Party, and Hideo Yamahana, Director of the Education and Propaganda Bureau, protested to the Metropolitan Police Department today, saying that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has recently been constantly summoning Socialist Party members, which is a form of political suppression.

　　日共中央号召人民加强团结
    同岸内阁法西斯横暴行为斗争到底
    社会党抗议自由民主党强使众议院通过反动法律
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央干部会今天在“赤旗报”上发表声明，号召日本人民同日本卖国反动势力破坏宪法来强使国会通过反动法律的横暴行为展开斗争。
    声明强烈指责岸信介内阁和自由民主党24日在众议院会议上单方面地强行审议和通过禁止在国会周围示威游行的法律。声明说，这是日本议会成立以来在战前“帝国议会”时代也未曾有过的横暴行为。无耻地强行通过违反宪法、限制人民集会和自由表达意志的反动法律，完全是法西斯匪徒惯用的手段。
    声明说，日本共产党严重抗议岸信介内阁和自由民主党的这种横暴行为，同时将同日本人民一起，为阻止这项法律在参议院中通过而斗争到底。
    声明揭露，岸信介内阁和自由民主党等日本卖国反动势力的阴谋显然是企图在修改“安全条约”的同时，逐步复活军国主义的警察政治。
    因此，它们在恶劣地修改宪法以前，阴谋制造既成事实，公开蹂躏宪法关于和平民主的条款，镇压以工人阶级为中心的争取和平和民主的运动。
    声明强调指出，日本人民绝对不容许这种反动阴谋得逞。目前，争取和平、中立、独立、民主和维护生活权利的工人阶级同日本人民的团结正在日益加强，他们的斗争正在发展。只有进一步加强这种团结和展开斗争，才能阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”，并且阻止岸信介内阁对宪法的进一步破坏。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会今天举行的紧急会议认为，自由民主党昨天在众议院内单独通过禁止在国会周围示威游行法律的作法，是一党独裁的表现。
    社会党认为，众议院议长加藤镣五郎对这件事应当负重大责任。社会党委员长铃木茂三郎和书记长浅沼稻次郎今天就自由民主党的蛮横行为向加藤镣五郎提出了抗议。
    社会党决定，如果加藤议长不能给予满意的答复，它将拒绝参加众议院各委员会的审议工作。
    众议院副议长正木清（原是社会党议员）今天提出辞职，表示抗议自由民主党和加藤镣五郎在众议院的专断行为。
    社会党国会对策委员会今天决定，社会党要在明天提出要求解散众议院的议案。
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本社会党组织局长江田三郎和教育宣传局长山花秀雄今天向警察厅提出抗议说，东京警视厅最近不断地要传讯社会党议员，这是一种政治上的镇压。
