Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 30th: "Lao Patriotic News" published on November 12th a letter from the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference. The letter once again pointed out that the current tense situation in Laos was caused by the destruction of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements by US imperialism and its Lao running dogs.

In the letter, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front once again expressed its firm opposition to the UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld sending a "permanent representative" to Laos.

The letter reiterated the Lao Patriotic Front's position that the Lao issue is an internal affair of the Lao people, and therefore must be resolved peacefully through consultation by the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Patriotic Front on the basis of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements, and under the supervision and assistance of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the Lao International Commission.

In the letter, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front requested the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to jointly issue a statement stating that the Lao issue must be resolved on the basis of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements; and to take urgent measures to restore the activities of the Lao International Commission, and to reconvene the Geneva Conference to seek ways to normalize the tense situation in Laos, and that the immediate priority is to negotiate with the Lao Royal Government to force them to restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, stop the civil war, and hold consultations to restore peace in Laos.

    老挝爱国战线党函日内瓦会议两主席
    谴责美国制造老挝紧张局势
    反对联合国派驻“常设代表”
    新华社河内30日电　“老挝爱国新闻”11月12日刊登了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会写给1954年日内瓦会议两位主席的信。信中再一次指出，老挝当前紧张局势是美帝国主义和它的老挝走狗破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议所造成的。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在信中，再一次表示坚决反对联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德向老挝派驻“常设代表”。
    这封信重申了老挝爱国战线党的立场，即老挝问题是老挝人民的内部事务，因此必须由老挝王国政府和老挝爱国战线党在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上并且在日内瓦会议两位主席和老挝国际委员会的监督和协助下，用协商的方式加以和平解决。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在信中要求日内瓦会议两位主席共同发表声明，说明老挝问题必须在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上加以解决；并采取紧急措施恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，再次召开日内瓦会议以寻求促使老挝紧张局势正常化的办法，而目前首先是向老挝王国政府交涉，迫使他们恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由，停止内战，举行协商以恢复老挝的和平。
