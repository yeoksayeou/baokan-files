　　"All Thanks to the Strong Leadership of the Party"
　　Du Ruizhi, First Secretary of the CPC Foshan Prefectural Committee in Guangdong Province

　　In June of this year, the four counties of Huiyang, Dongguan, Zengcheng, and Boluo on both banks of the Dongjiang River in Foshan Prefecture, Guangdong Province, suffered an unprecedented flood disaster in a century, becoming a severely affected area. Under the leadership of the Party, the people in the disaster area, starting from the struggle against the flood, carried out uninterrupted intense and arduous struggles to heal the wounds of the disaster area, vigorously restore production, and eliminate traces of the disaster; relying on the power of the people's communes, and after five months of nationwide struggle, decisive victories have been achieved in the comprehensive restoration of production and reconstruction of homes.

　　"New villages seen instead of disaster traces," "A bumper harvest in a disaster year, all thanks to the strong leadership of the Party," "The Communist Party's kindness is longer than the Dongjiang River," these words from the hearts of the Dongjiang people are by no means accidental. More than five months ago, the ferocious floods, irresistible to human power, drowned 1.3 million mu of half-ripe early rice and 350,000 mu of miscellaneous grains, washed away 16,274 dikes and small and large water conservancy projects, destroyed 120,000 houses, and took away a huge amount of material wealth, turning a good home into ruins; at that time, the eating, housing, clothing, and late-season production of 1.2 million disaster-stricken people were seriously threatened. Could the economy of the disaster area be restored? How long would it take to recover? These were major issues of concern to the people, and even more so, questions that the people in the disaster area demanded to be answered. The Communist Party answered this question with the most optimistic and firm attitude, and the People's Government supported the disaster area with huge amounts of financial and material resources; and put forward the call to the Dongjiang people to "recover the losses of the early season in the late season," which greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the people in the disaster area. Under the strong leadership of the Party, the people of Dongjiang, with the heroic spirit of subduing dragons and tigers, and the indomitable tenacious will, gave full play to the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, conquered serious difficulties in a short period of time, restored production at an astonishing speed, rebuilt their homes, and achieved a harvest even greater than in non-disaster years. This year, the four counties had a total of 200,000 mu of paddy fields for the late season, and harvested more than 1.45 billion jin of rice, equivalent to 97% of the total output for the entire year of 1957. Currently, more than 63,000 new houses have been built, accounting for more than half of the 124,000 that should be built.

　　The high-speed restoration of the disaster area's economy is only possible under the socialist system, and it can only be achieved under the strong leadership of the Party. Under the high concern and strong support of the Central Government, and under the instructions of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, the Foshan Prefectural Party Committee immediately organized a production and disaster relief headquarters; the Provincial Party Committee, the Prefectural Party Committee, and the Dongjiang garrison dispatched more than 2,000 cadres and medical personnel to form a strong disaster area work team and medical team, together with the cadres at all levels of the four disaster-stricken counties, disaster-stricken communes, and disaster-stricken brigades, to go deep into the masses, eat, live, and work with the disaster victims, and lead the work in the disaster area. From the time when the floods raged and transportation was cut off, the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee immediately provided strong support to the disaster area, and sent planes to airdrop food and materials, and used various methods to continuously transport food, seeds, clothing, and other supplies supported by the state and various regions to the disaster area. Due to relying on and giving full play to the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, implementing large-scale collaboration, and with the lead of Party member cadres in hard work and the assistance of the garrison, a total of more than 25,000 meters long dike breach repair project, requiring more than 2 million cubic meters of earthwork to restore, only took more than 20 days to fully restore; 3.2 million mu of late rice was all planted within ten days after the "Beginning of Autumn"; sideline production was also quickly launched, and time was won to lay the foundation for the comprehensive restoration of the disaster area's economy and for striving for a bumper harvest.

　　The rapid recovery of the disaster area's economy is primarily due to the fact that it embarked on the correct road pointed out by the Party from the very beginning, and implemented the policy of "self-reliance in production, supplemented by strong state support, and rapid economic recovery." Because the Party concentrated the disaster area's masses' demands for rapidly changing the face of the disaster area, and put forward the battle slogan of "eliminating disaster traces this winter," it gave the masses a clear direction and great encouragement. The masses conquered many difficulties with soaring enthusiasm and infinite strength.

　　The young people's communes have been tested in the face of serious disasters, and the facts have proved that they not only stand firm under major disasters, but also are the basis for the rapid recovery of the disaster area's economy. Throughout the entire process of production and disaster relief, the Party always paid attention to giving full play to the tremendous power of the people's communes, and organized large-scale cooperation in a timely manner according to the production needs of different periods. Non-disaster teams vigorously supported disaster-stricken teams with labor, tools, and seedlings, arranged accommodation for disaster victims, and supported technicians and materials for building houses. This greatly enhanced the subjective strength to fight against nature; and enabled the restoration and construction work in the disaster area to be carried out more, faster, better, and more economically.

　　At present, the entire people in the Dongjiang disaster area, on the road pointed out by the Party, are conquering the Dongjiang River, eradicating water disasters, and, on the basis of a special bumper harvest in the late season, comprehensively restoring and developing the economy, completely realizing the goal of "seeing new villages instead of disaster traces," and thoroughly eliminating all traces of the disaster, launched a vigorous winter and spring production movement centered on water conservancy.

### “全靠党的领导强”

　　“全靠党的领导强”
　　中共广东省佛山地委第一书记　杜瑞芝
    今年6月间，广东省佛山专区东江两岸的惠阳、东莞、增城、博罗四县，遭受了百年来所未有的洪水灾害，成了重灾区。灾区人民在党的领导下，从和洪水搏斗时开始，为医治灾区创伤，大力恢复生产，消灭灾害痕迹，进行了不间断的紧张艰苦的斗争；依靠人民公社的威力，经过全民奋战五个月后，在全面恢复生产、重建家园工作方面，已经取得决定性的胜利。
    “不见灾痕见新村”，“灾年获得大增产，全靠党的领导强”，“共产党的恩情比东江水还长”，这些出自东江人民心里的话，决不是偶然说出来的。在五个多月以前，为人力所不能抗拒的凶猛洪水，淹死了一百三十万亩半熟的早稻和三十五万亩杂粮，冲塌了堤围和大小水利工程一万六千二百七十四宗，毁坏十二万间住屋，夺走了数量巨大的物资财富，大好的家园几成废墟；当时一百二十万灾民群众的吃、住、穿和晚造的生产，都受到严重威胁。灾区经济能否恢复？要多长的时间才能恢复？这是人们所关心的大事情，更是灾区人民要求回答的问题。共产党以最乐观和最坚定的态度回答这一问题，人民政府以巨量的财力、物力支援了灾区；并向东江人民提出“晚造夺回早造损失”的号召，这些都大大地鼓舞了灾区人民的斗志。在党坚强领导下的东江人民，以降龙伏虎般的英雄气概，坚忍不拔的顽强意志，发挥了人民公社的无比优越性，在不长的时间里，征服了严重的困难，以惊人的速度恢复了生产，重建了家园，取得了比非灾年还大的丰收。四个县今年晚造共有禾田二十万亩，共收稻谷十四亿五千多万斤，等于1957年全年总产量的97％。目前已建成新房子六万三千多间，占应建十二万四千多间的一半以上。
    高速度地恢复灾区经济，只有在社会主义制度下才是可能的，也只有在党的坚强领导下才能够实现。在中央高度关怀和大力支援下，在广东省委指示下，佛山地委随即组织了生产救灾指挥部；省委、地委和东江驻军抽派了两千多名干部和医护人员，组成强大的灾区工作队和医疗队，和四个受灾县、受灾公社、受灾大队的各级党组织的全体干部，深入群众，同灾民同吃、同住、同劳动，领导灾区工作。从洪水泛滥、交通断绝时开始，中央和省委就立即大力支援灾区，并派飞机空投粮食、物资，用各种办法源源不断地将国家和各地支援的粮食、种苗、衣物等运送到灾区。由于依靠和发挥了人民公社的无比优越性，实行了大协作，在党员干部带头苦战和驻军的援助下，共有二万五千多米长、需担二百多万土方才能复原的堤围缺口工程，只费了二十多天时间就全部恢复了；三百二十万亩晚稻，在“立秋”后十天就全部插下秧；副业生产也很快开展起来，并赢得了时间，为全面恢复灾区经济，为争取大丰收打下了基础。
    灾区经济这么快地恢复，首先是由于一开始就走上党所指引的正确道路，贯彻执行了“生产自救，辅以国家大力支援，迅速恢复经济”的方针。由于党集中了灾区群众迅速改变灾区面貌的要求，提出了“把灾痕消灭在今冬”的战斗口号，它给群众以明确的方向和巨大的鼓舞。群众以冲天的干劲，以无穷无尽的力量征服重重的困难。
    年轻的人民公社，在严重的灾害面前经受了考验，事实已经证明它不但在大灾之下站得住脚，而且它正是灾区经济得以迅速恢复的基础。党在整个生产救灾的过程中，时刻注意发挥人民公社的巨大威力，根据不同时期的生产需要，及时地组织了大协作，非灾队大力支援受灾队以劳动力、工具、种苗，安排灾民住宿，支援建房子的技工和材料。这就大大地增强了与自然作斗争的主观力量；使灾区的恢复和建设工作，能更多、更快、更好、更省地进行。
    目前，东江灾区的全体人民，正在党所指引的道路上，征服东江，根治水患，为在晚造特大丰收的基础上全面地恢复和发展经济，为全部实现“不见灾痕见新村”的目标，为彻底地消灭受灾的一切痕迹，展开了轰轰烈烈的以水利为中心的冬春生产运动。
