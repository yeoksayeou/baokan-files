(From our newspaper in Guangzhou, December 11th) The lives of migrant workers at the Shenzhen Reservoir construction site in Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, are achieving five goods: good food, good sleep, good entertainment, good hygiene, and good service for migrant workers.

The Shenzhen Reservoir is the largest of the ten key water conservancy projects being built in Bao'an County this year, scheduled for completion by the end of March next year. The task of this project is being undertaken by more than 14,000 migrant workers from thirteen communes across the county. To ensure the timely completion of the task, the Shenzhen Reservoir construction site Party committee first focused on the high-efficiency movement centered on tool reform. However, the Party committee also deeply recognized that arranging the lives of migrant workers well is an important condition for carrying out the high-efficiency movement. Therefore, from the very beginning of the project, the Party committee has been very concerned about the lives of the masses, doing everything possible to arrange the lives of migrant workers well, according to needs and possibilities. After a series of arduous efforts, overcoming numerous difficulties, the lives of the masses have basically achieved good food, good sleep, good entertainment, good hygiene, and good service for the masses, becoming a model for organizing the lives of the masses at water conservancy construction sites throughout the county.

In terms of eating, in addition to the planned supply of materials for migrant workers, the Bao'an County Party Committee has also given special consideration to grain, oil, sugar, and meat, and has designated several production brigades near the reservoir as vegetable production bases for the reservoir. The construction site Party committee made full use of this favorable condition, and educated the cooks to use their wisdom, so that all canteens achieved hot meals and fragrant dishes, not only ensuring that migrant workers can eat half a catty to a catty of vegetables every day, but also can often eat fish and meat, and add dishes to improve life after each assault battle.

In terms of housing, new construction lacked materials, and migrant worker accommodation was a major problem. However, the construction site Party committee made do with whatever was available, and adopted a combination of external purchases and self-reliance, using rice straw, bamboo, and wood to build a large number of thatched sheds, equipped with bamboo and wooden beds, solving the accommodation problem for all migrant workers, without anyone sleeping outdoors or on cold ground; at the same time, it also used the method of smearing mud on the grass walls to prevent cold and keep warm, so that migrant workers can sleep warmly and soundly.

In terms of cultural and recreational life, the construction site often organizes cultural evenings, with performances by visiting troupes from other counties and amateur troupes from schools and organs in the county seat, or showing movies, ensuring that migrant workers can see two or three movies and several theatrical performances every month. The construction site also established a broadcasting network, often broadcasting cultural and artistic programs; and widely organized peasant singers to compose songs about the deeds of advanced figures and sing them at the construction site.

In terms of medical and health, patriotic health organizations and health systems were established, kitchens, dormitories, and toilets are cleaned regularly, drinking water is disinfected, ensuring that vegetables are cooked and water is boiled, so that migrant workers do not eat cold food or drink cold water.

The service for migrant workers is even more thoughtful. The construction site established comprehensive stores, barbershops, sewing shops, laundries, banks, post offices and other service organizations. To facilitate migrant workers to buy goods, more than 20 peddlers were also organized to go to the construction site to sell goods. More than ten barbers also carry their tools to various work areas every day, taking advantage of the migrant workers' rest time to give them haircuts.

The lives of the vast numbers of migrant workers have been properly arranged, their labor enthusiasm is high, and the high-efficiency movement has been powerfully promoted. Now, the attendance rate of the entire construction site has reached more than 97%, and most of the brigades and teams often maintain full attendance. Mass labor competitions are also in full swing, and mutual interlocking competitions between soldiers and soldiers, generals and generals, and face-to-face competitions have been widely launched, and a large number of shock brigades and model teams have emerged, and labor efficiency has been continuously improved.

The reason why the lives of migrant workers at this reservoir are so good is mainly due to the importance attached to it by the Party committee. The construction site Party committee believes that while strengthening the political and ideological education of migrant workers, properly arranging the lives of migrant workers is a necessary condition for carrying out high efficiency. Therefore, the Party committee timely criticized the erroneous view of some cadres that "life is a trivial matter," and often educated cadres to care about the lives of the masses. Cao Ruoming, the Secretary of the Bao'an County Party Committee and the Secretary of the Construction Site Party Committee, and other responsible cadres of the Party committee also often go deep into the kitchens, stores and other places to check the work, and also often go deep into the construction sites and dormitories to listen to the opinions of the masses. The construction site Party committee has specially convened many meetings to study and solve issues related to the lives of migrant workers.

    体贴入微改善水利工地民工生活
    吃得好　睡得好　文娱好　卫生好　为民工服务好
    宝安县深圳水库工地做到五好
    本报广州11日电　广东省宝安县深圳水库工地民工生活做到五好：吃得好，睡得好，文娱好，卫生好，为民工服务好。
    深圳水库是宝安县今年兴建的十项重点水利工程中最大的一项，计划在明年3月底完成。担负这次工程任务的是来自全县十三个公社的一万四千多民工。为保证按时完成任务，中共深圳水库工地党委首先抓住了以工具改革为中心的高工效运动。但是，党委也深深认识到安排好民工生活是开展高工效运动的一个重要条件。因此，从工程一开始，党委就十分关心群众生活，根据需要和可能，千方百计把民工生活安排好。经过一系列的艰苦努力，克服了重重困难，使群众生活基本做到了吃得好，睡得好，文娱好，卫生好和为群众服务好，成为全县水利工地组织群众生活的标兵。
    在吃饭方面，除民工们的计划供应物资外，中共宝安县委在粮、油、糖、肉等方面还特别给予照顾，并把水库附近的几个生产大队划给水库做为蔬菜生产基地。工地党委充分利用了这一有利条件，并教育炊事人员发挥智慧，使所有食堂都做到了饭热菜香，不仅能保证民工每天吃到半斤到一斤的蔬菜，而且还可以经常吃到鱼、肉，每个突击战役后还加菜改善生活。
    在居住方面，新建工程缺乏材料，民工住宿是个大问题。但是，工地党委因陋就简，采取外购和自力更生相结合的办法，用稻草、竹木搭盖了大批的茅棚，内设竹木床铺，解决了全部民工的住宿问题，没有一个人露宿、睡冷地；同时还用在草墙上抹泥巴的办法来防寒保温，使民工睡暖睡香。
    在文娱生活方面，工地经常组织文艺晚会，由外地来县访问的剧团和县城的学校、机关业余剧团演出或放映电影，保证民工每月能看到二、三次电影和几次戏剧演出。工地还建立了广播网，经常广播文艺节目；并且广泛组织农民歌手把先进人物的事迹编成歌曲在工地演唱。
    在医疗卫生方面，建立了爱国卫生组织和卫生制度，厨房、宿舍、厕所定期打扫，实行饮水消毒，保证菜熟水开，使民工不吃冷食，不喝冷水。
    为民工服务方面，做得更是周到。工地建立了综合商店、理发店、缝纫店、洗衣店、银行、邮电所等服务组织。为便利民工购买物品，还组织了二十多个货郎担到工地巡回售货。十多个理发工人也每天带着工具深入各工区，利用民工休息时间理发。
    广大民工生活得到了妥善安排，劳动热情高涨，有力地推动了高工效运动。现在，全工地出勤率达到97％以上，大部分的大队、中队经常保持满勤。群众性的劳动竞赛也热火朝天，普遍展开了兵对兵、将对将、面对面的互相挂钩竞赛，涌现了大批突击队、标兵队，劳动效率不断提高。
    这个水库的民工生活所以搞得好，主要是由于党委重视。工地党委认为，在加强对民工的政治思想教育的同时，妥善安排民工的生活，是开展高工效的必要条件。因此，党委及时批判了部分干部的“生活是小事”的错误论调，经常教育干部关心群众生活。中共宝安县县委书记兼工地党委书记曹若茗和党委其他负责干部还经常深入到厨房、商店等处检查工作，也经常深入到工地、宿舍听取群众意见。工地党委曾特别召开了多次的会议研究解决有关民工生活问题。
