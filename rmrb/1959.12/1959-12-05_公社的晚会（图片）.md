The Commune's Evening Party
Ding Ding (painting), Chen Tao (poem)

The gongs are banging, the drums are hurried,
Pulling the Huqin and blowing the flute,
Singing and dancing, truly beautiful.
Old grandma, smiling happily,
Looking at the little girls on stage;
Young lads, holding their breath,
Eyes wide open;
Little children, not naughty,
Concentrating on watching the play.
…On stage and off stage, all rejoice together,
Flowers of happiness bloom in the heart.
The commune has a great harvest,
Everyone is happy,
Hold an evening party to celebrate,
Strive for the red flag again next year!

    公社的晚会
    丁仃作画　陈涛配诗锣儿敲，鼓儿急，拉起胡琴吹起笛，连歌带舞真美丽。老大妈，笑嘻嘻，望着台上小闺女；小伙子，屏声息，眼睛睁得大大的；小娃儿，不调皮，聚精会神在看戏。……台上台下同欢乐，幸福花儿开心里。公社大丰收，人人都欢喜，开个晚会来庆祝，明年再夺大红旗！
