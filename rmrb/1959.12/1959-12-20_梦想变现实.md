    Dreams Become Reality
    In front of Tiananmen Square, there now stands a group of tall and magnificent buildings – the Great Hall of the People and the Museum of History. With new buildings rising, old houses must inevitably be torn down. Where do the original residents live now? Newsreel No. 69 features a report on this topic.
    In Chongwen District of Beijing, on what used to be a reed marsh and wasteland, new-style buildings have been erected. The original residents who lived in front of Tiananmen Square have all moved into these new modern buildings.
    Among these residents is an old man named Hou Shiqiang, who lived in Qianfu Hutong in front of Tiananmen Square for nearly sixty years. For sixty years, Old Man Hou's small house became increasingly dilapidated and was on the verge of collapse. Whenever there were wind and rain, the whole family would worry and fear. The uneasy feeling gradually deepened. Old Man Hou dreamed of having a new house, even if it were just as small. This spring, Old Man Hou's family suddenly moved out of the dilapidated house he had lived in for sixty years and into a tall building. Old Man Hou's dream came true. The current building is thousands of times better than his original house, and the wonderful life makes him feel infinitely happy.
    One day, Old Man Hou, along with his eighty-year-old father and granddaughter, came to Tiananmen Square. Qianfu Hutong had changed. Before them stood the tall and magnificent Great Hall of the People. Since the founding of the People's Republic, people had also dreamed that tall and magnificent building complexes should be built in front of Tiananmen Square to complement the solemn Tiananmen. In the blink of an eye, this dream has also become a reality. Old Man Hou knows who turned the dream into reality.

    梦想变现实
    在天安门前，现在是一片高大、雄伟的建筑群——人民大会堂和历史博物馆。新的建筑群起来，旧的房屋必然要毁掉，原来的居民，现在住在哪里？在新闻简报第六十九号中，有一个主题，作了这方面的报道。
    在北京崇文区过去的一片苇塘和荒地上，现在盖起了一幢幢新式楼房，原来在天安门前住的居民，都搬进了这些新式大楼。
    这些居民中，有一位叫侯世强的老大爷，他在天安门前的前府胡同住了将近六十年，六十年来，侯老大爷的那座矮小的房子，越来越破，快要倒塌了，每逢刮风下雨，一家人就担心、受怕。不安的心情在逐渐加深。侯老大爷梦想过，要是能有一座新房子就好了，那怕是同样矮小。就在今年春天，侯老大爷家突然搬出了他苦守了六十年的破房子，搬进了高大的楼房，侯老大爷的梦想实现了。现在的楼房比他原来的房子要好千万倍，美好的生活使他感到无限的幸福。
    有一天，侯老大爷，同他八十岁的父亲带着小孙女来到天安门前。前府胡同变了样，眼前是高大、雄伟的人民大会堂。建国以来，人们也曾梦想过，天安门前，应该建筑起高大、雄伟的建筑群，这样才能同庄严的天安门相衬，一眨眼，这个梦想也变成了现实。侯老大爷知道是谁把梦想变成了现实。
