Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Electric News -- In the increase production and practice economy movement, Jiamusi Textile Factory, using the lively "production games" approach, with technological innovation and revolution as the center, launched a mass-based upsurge of intensive training and grand performances. This kind of "production games," where everyone participates in performances and skilled workers are selected at every level, broadly mobilized and leveraged the production enthusiasm and creativity of the entire factory's workforce. It concentrates the scattered reforms and fragmented experiences of each worker, systematically summarizes and promotes them, thereby rapidly and universally enhancing the technical level of the workers, promoting the deepening of the socialist labor competition, and improving the enterprise's management work, enabling the factory to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in high production, high quality, low consumption, and safety.

Jiamusi Textile Factory began using the "production games" method to organize competitions starting in the third quarter of this year. Since July, based on production needs, they have successively convened seven "production games" at the group, work section, workshop, and branch factory levels. More than 7,000 employees throughout the factory have performed an average of over 20 times each. Since the launch of this competition, production levels have been consistently rising. In the third quarter of this year, the entire factory completed the state plan five days ahead of schedule; the daily output of cotton yarn in October increased by 18.82% compared to the highest level since the Great Leap Forward; and in November, the monthly plan was completed six days ahead of schedule, with the daily output of cotton yarn increasing by another 12.7% compared to October. Product quality has significantly improved, with first-grade first-class cotton yarn increasing from just over 85% in June to 100%, and the quality of cotton cloth entering the warehouse increasing by 9.3% compared to June, reaching 98%. Raw cotton consumption indicators have decreased month by month, saving more than 30,000 jin of cotton in the third quarter alone. After more than three months of intensive training, 80% of the apprentices in the factory can now operate independently; the technical proficiency of the veteran workers has also greatly improved. Weaving workers have increased from an average of 24 automatic looms per person in the second quarter to 36 looms, and spinning workers have increased from an average of 600 spindles per person in the past to 1,000 spindles. The entire factory has seen the emergence of nearly 2,000 single-skill experts and 145 all-around experts.

The "production games" experience created by Jiamusi Textile Factory is a new development in the form of socialist labor competition. Its specific practices are divided into four steps. The first step, under the unified leadership of the Party committee and with the joint participation of the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, is to form a "games" command, first identify the key aspects of production, propose topics, clarify the direction of technical intensive training, and, based on different types of work and different objects, after mass discussion, formulate the criteria for selecting skilled workers. Then, a mobilization meeting is convened to mobilize all employees to participate in technical intensive training, work together to break through production bottlenecks, and strive to become skilled workers. This is the most fundamental link in the entire "games." The second step is, after the mass-based intensive training is launched and the technical level of the employees has generally improved, to conduct large-scale measurements and performances at the group, work section, and workshop levels, one by one, to discover the scattered reforms and fragmented experiences of each person. Then, through the selection of skilled workers at every level and the widespread establishment of pacesetters, a competitive upsurge of "learning, comparing, catching up, surpassing, and helping" is launched. After the various experiences of the masses and skilled workers are discovered through performances and measurements, the third step is to adopt the method of combining leading cadres, technicians, veteran workers, and advanced pacesetters to initially analyze and summarize them. Then, after mass discussion and scientific and technical measurement, these experiences are summarized and systematized. Then, after mass-based production verification, good experiences are incorporated into operating procedures and rules and regulations. The fourth step is to organize advanced experience "explanation groups," "sowing teams," and "promotion stations," and through competitive forms such as learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward, the complete set of advanced experiences is rapidly promoted, the technical level of the workers is universally improved, and production leaps forward.

Since Jiamusi Textile Factory held "production games," it has summarized and promoted 202 advanced experiences, of which 57 have become complete sets. The promotion of these advanced experiences has meant that almost every production link in the factory has undergone technological innovation or improved operating methods. For example, the spinning workshop concentrated six different splicing methods of "skilled workers" and summarized a set of "parallel light-lift splicing operation method." After technical intensive training, it was quickly and widely promoted throughout the workshop, reducing cotton yarn neps by 70% and greatly improving product quality. The maintenance section of the mechanical department's cloth yard, through the games, also quickly enabled all workers in the section to master the advanced flat car technology of Chen Xizhong's group, universally doubling the efficiency of flat cars.

The improvement of production and technology requires that management work keeps up in a timely manner. In the "production games," Jiamusi Textile Factory formulated and revised 32 technical operating procedures based on the advanced experiences created by the masses. At the same time, it also strengthened and improved maintenance, process management, adjusted the labor organization, and established and improved 151 rules and regulations accordingly.

"Production games" is also a good form of practical communist education for the masses. Because the "games" adopts the method of measuring everyone and selecting at every level, it can fully encourage every employee to carry forward revolutionary heroism, show their talents, and participate in the competition. Even some people who used to hold their skills and never learn from others have changed their attitudes this time and actively participated in the performance competition. When the selected "skilled workers" are to attend a higher-level performance, other workers in his group, work section, and workshop teach their scattered experiences or skills to the "skilled workers" to help him improve his technical level.

Recently, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee held an industrial on-site meeting in Jiamusi to further promote the experience of the "production games" of Jiamusi Textile Factory.

    出课题人人练技艺　大表演层层选能手
    三结合总结好经验　播种队系统传技术
    “生产运动会”提高全厂技术水平
    黑龙江省委推广佳木斯纺织厂劳动竞赛的新经验
    据新华社哈尔滨电　佳木斯纺织厂在增产节约运动中，运用生动活泼的“生产运动会”的方式，以技术革新和技术革命为中心，掀起了群众性的大练兵、大表演热潮。这种人人参加表演、层层选拔能手的“生产运动会”，广泛地调动和发挥了全厂职工的生产积极性和创造性。它把每个工人的点滴改革和零星经验集中起来，系统地进行总结和推广，因而迅速普遍地提高了工人的技术水平，促进了社会主义劳动竞赛的深入开展和企业管理工作的改进和提高，使工厂实现了高产、优质、低耗、安全的全面跃进。
    佳木斯纺织厂是从今年第三季度起采用“生产运动会”的方式组织竞赛的。从7月份以来，他们根据生产的需要，已经分小组、工段、车间、分场先后召开了七次“生产运动会”，全厂七千多名职工，平均每人都表演了二十次以上。这一竞赛开展以后，生产水平一直上升。今年第三季度全厂提前五天完成了国家计划；10月份棉纱日产量比大跃进以来的最高水平提高18.82％；11月份提前六天完成了月计划，棉纱日产量又比10月份提高了12.7％。产品质量显著提高，一等一级棉纱由6月份的85％强提高到百分之百，入库棉布质量比6月份提高9.3％，达到98％。原棉消耗指标逐月降低，仅三季度就节约用棉三万多斤。经过三个多月大练兵的锻炼，全厂有80％的徒工现在已能独立操作；老工人的技术熟练程度也大大提高。织布工人由二季度每人平均掌握二十四台自动织布机提高到三十六台，细纱工人由过去每人平均看六百个纱锭增加到一千个纱锭。全厂涌现了近二千名单项能手和一百四十五名全面能手。
    佳木斯纺织厂创造的“生产运动会”经验，是社会主义劳动竞赛形式的新发展。它的具体做法共分四个步骤。第一步是在党委的统一领导下，由行政、工会、共青团共同组成“运动会”指挥部，首先摸清生产关键，提出课题，明确技术大练兵的方向，并且根据不同工种、不同对象，经过群众讨论，订出能手选拔条件。然后召开动员大会，动员全体职工参加技术大练兵，大家一起突破生产关键，争当能手。这是整个“运动会”最基本的一环。第二步是在群众性大练兵开展起来以后、职工普遍提高了技术水平的基础上，在小组、工段、车间，逐级、逐个进行大测定、大表演，发掘每个人的点滴改革和零星经验，再通过层层选拔能手、广泛树立标兵，掀起“学、比、赶、超、帮”的竞赛热潮。经过表演、测定把群众和能手们的各种经验发掘出来后，第三步就采取领导干部、技术人员、老工人和先进标兵三结合的办法，初步分析汇总，再经过群众讨论和进行科学技术测定，把这些经验归纳总结起来，使之系统成套。然后经过群众性的生产验证，把好的经验纳入操作规程和规章制度中。第四步就组织先进经验“讲解团”、“播种队”、“推广站”，和通过学先进、赶先进、帮落后等竞赛形式，使成套的先进经验，迅速推广，普遍提高工人的技术水平，推动生产跃进。
    佳木斯纺织厂从举行“生产运动会”以来，总结推广的先进经验就有二百零二项，其中有五十七项已经成了套。这些先进经验的推广使全厂的每个生产环节，几乎都有技术革新或改进了操作方法。如细纱车间集中了“能手”的六种不同接头方法，总结出一套“平行轻挑接头操作法”，经过技术大练兵，很快就在全车间普遍推广，使棉纱疙瘩降低了70％，大大提高了产品质量。机械部布场保全工段经过运动会，也很快使全工段工人掌握了陈锡忠小组的先进平车技术，把平车效率普遍提高一倍。
    生产和技术的提高，要求管理工作及时地跟上去。佳木斯纺织厂在“生产运动会”中根据群众创造的先进经验，制订与修改补充了三十二项技术操作规程。同时，也相应地加强和改进了保全保养，工艺管理，调整了劳动组织，建立与健全了一百五十一项规章制度。
    “生产运动会”也是对群众进行实际的共产主义教育的一种好形式。由于“运动会”采取人人测定、层层选拔的办法，因此能够充分激励每个职工发扬革命的英雄主义，各显其能，参加比赛。就连一些自持有技术、从不学习别人经验的人，这次也都改变了态度，积极参加了表演比赛。当选拔出来的“能手”要出席更高一级的表演时，他所在的小组、工段、车间的其他工人都把自己的点滴经验或一技之长教给“能手”，帮他提高技术水平。
    最近，中共黑龙江省委在佳木斯召开工业现场会议，进一步推广了佳木斯纺织厂“生产运动会”的经验。
