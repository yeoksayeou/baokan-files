Science for Production, Production Uses Science
Luohan Commune's Scientific Research Activities Have Clear Goals and Significant Achievements

    (Our report) Chengdu - The Luohan People's Commune members in the suburbs of Luzhou City, Sichuan, praise the commune's scientific research activities in a ballad: "Where does technology come from? From the hands of heroes; Where do raw materials come from? They are taken locally." This commune gives full play to the superiority of the commune, under the slogan of "production using science, speaking of science everywhere, everyone learning science," closely integrates with production, and actively carries out mass scientific and technological research activities. A scientific and technological research and popularization network with the Scientific Research Institute and Red and Expert School as the center has been built throughout the commune. The commune members have liberated their minds and carried out scientific research activities, making the various production activities in the commune, with agriculture as the center, appear prosperous.

    The mass scientific and technological research activities here fully demonstrate the superiority of the People's Commune. The Luohan People's Commune was formed in September last year by merging two townships and one town, and sixteen advanced agricultural cooperatives. In the past, the largest Guanghui Agricultural Cooperative here had also run an amateur technical school, but it was quickly shut down due to weak leadership, lack of funds, and difficulty in solving the work point subsidies for teachers. After the establishment of the commune, under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, the party committee secretary personally served as the chairman of the Science and Technology Association, established full-time cadres to manage this work, and widely established scientific and technological research activity organizations; and in accordance with the production requirements of each period, compiled scientific and technological teaching outlines and published science newsletters. The commune also selected a group of commune members with production experience and certain book knowledge for training to serve as teachers, and quickly set up ten Red and Expert Schools and branch schools, and thirty-seven Red and Expert classes, with more than 1,700 commune members participating in the study. This has cultivated a large number of scientific and technological backbones, and scientific research activities have therefore developed vigorously. Commune member Yao Shubin of the Qunfeng Management Area proposed the idea of manufacturing local nitrate as fertilizer to the agricultural cooperative four years ago, but due to the small cooperative, lack of funds, and lack of technical knowledge, he never started. Now, a fertilizer factory has been set up in the commune, and Yao Shubin has not only learned how to manufacture local nitrate in the factory, but also mastered the skills of manufacturing various fertilizers. Because the People's Commune comprehensively manages various economic undertakings, many projects that agricultural cooperatives had no strength to manage during the agricultural cooperative period, such as horticulture and beekeeping, have now been developed by the Luohan Commune. In this way, many people with diverse business experience and specialties can now give play to their talents and carry out various scientific research activities. In the past year alone, the commune has successfully researched and tested more than 30 kinds of seedling cultivation and fruit strengthening methods in horticulture, such as air layering, cutting, and grafting. More than 60 local experts in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery have emerged throughout the commune. In addition, the People's Commune has also organized various collective welfare undertakings, and the vast number of farmers have received reliable social insurance, thus their enthusiasm for developing production and researching science and technology has been high, and scientific research activities have been carried out more widely and deeply. In the past year, the commune has carried out more than 200 scientific and technological research projects, of which 138 have been successfully researched, tested, and promoted.

    Aiming at the key problems in production, what to do, what to study, mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions and think of ways, and organizing research and experiments in a planned way is a characteristic of the mass scientific and technological research activities of the Luohan Commune. Because scientific research activities are closely integrated with agricultural production, they not only strongly promote production, but also greatly enrich the content of scientific research activities. This spring, many wheat plants experienced lodging. According to the introduction of experienced farmers, the commune's scientific research institute used soaked gravel and bunting sand for calcination experiments. After calcination, it contained a large amount of phosphorus, potassium, and other substances, which were used to cultivate soil and build ridges, which could effectively prevent wheat lodging. More than 1,400 acres of wheat in the commune immediately promoted this experimental result, cultivating soil and building ridges once or twice, ensuring a large-scale harvest.

    In the early stage of carrying out scientific research activities, the Luohan People's Commune relied on the scientific research institute and its subordinate professional experimental farms to carry out various production technology research and high-yield experiments as the core of guiding and carrying out scientific and technological research activities; on the other hand, it used the Red and Expert School as a position to cultivate a large number of technical forces as the backbone, and widely imparted scientific and technological knowledge to commune members through field lectures, exhibitions, on-site meetings, science and technology newsletters, short-term training courses, and large-scale experimental fields, summarized the experience and inventions of the masses, and promoted the experimental research results of professional institutions. In this way, working, learning, researching, and promoting were carried out simultaneously, and scientific and technological work and production were twisted into one rope. In addition, this commune also fully carried forward the spirit of running science diligently and thriftily, starting from scratch, and relying on its own efforts. If there were no teachers to train technical backbones, farmers with rich experience were selected to serve as teachers, and nearby factories and schools were invited to provide guidance; if there was no equipment, thatched huts were used as factories, and jars and cans were used as boilers.

    With the wide development of scientific and technological research activities, the commune's agricultural and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production have all achieved comprehensive leaps forward. Among the 138 scientific and technological items successfully researched and promoted in the commune, including deep plowing, close planting, preventing lodging, manufacturing local chemical fertilizers, local pesticides, electric incubation of poultry, livestock breeding, and fruit tree cultivation. This year, the commune produced more than 300,000 jin of high-quality local chemical fertilizers and local pesticides, and created and promoted 32 kinds of tools such as deep plowing plows, more than 12,000 pieces. In this way, due to the universal deep plowing of land, rational close planting, sufficient fertilizer, and effective prevention of root, stem lodging and insect pests, the unit area yield of wheat in the commune increased by 34.8% compared with last year, rapeseed increased by 58.5%, and although early rice and middle rice suffered severe drought, the unit area yield still increased by 23.5% compared with last year. The development of other productions is also very rapid.

    Now, the Luohan People's Commune has formulated a comprehensive plan to further develop scientific research activities. The commune members are carrying out various experiments and researches with full enthusiasm to promote the continued leap forward of various productions next year. (Zhou Zuyou) (Attached picture)

    科学为生产  生产用科学
    罗汉公社科学研究活动目标明确成绩显著
    本报讯　四川泸州市郊罗汉人民公社社员赞颂社内科学研究活动的歌谣说：“技术哪里有？出自英雄手；原料哪里来？就地来取材。”这个公社发挥公社的优越性，在“生产用科学、处处讲科学、人人学科学”的口号下，紧密结合生产，积极开展群众性的科学技术研究活动，在全社建成了以科学研究所和红专学校为中心的科学技术研究和普及网。社员们思想解放，开展科学研究活动，使全社以农业为中心的各项生产出现繁荣的景象。
    这里在开展群众性科学技术研究活动中，充分显示了人民公社的优越性。罗汉人民公社是在去年9月由两乡一镇、十六个高级农业社合并组成的。过去，这里最大的光辉农业社，也曾经开办过一所业余技术学校，由于领导力量薄弱，资金缺乏，教师的补助工分也难于解决，很快就停办了。公社建立以后，在社党委统一领导下，党委书记亲自担任了科学技术协会主席，设立了专职干部管理这项工作，广泛建立了科学技术研究活动组织；并按照各时期的生产要求，编印科学技术教学大纲，出版科学小报。全社还挑选了一批具有生产经验和一定书本知识的社员加以培养，担任教师，并迅速办起红专学校和分校十所，红专班三十七个，参加学习的有一千七百多社员。这就培养出大批科学技术骨干，科学研究活动因而蓬勃开展起来。群丰管理区社员姚树彬，在四年以前曾经向农业社提出制造土硝作肥料的建议，由于社小资金少，又不懂技术，一直没有动手。现在，在公社里办起化肥厂，姚树彬不仅在厂内学会制造土硝，而且掌握了制造多种化肥的本领。因为人民公社综合经营各种经济事业，园艺、养蜂等许多农业社时期无力量经营的项目，现在罗汉公社都发展起来。这样，不少具有多种经营经验和特长的人，现在开始能发挥他们的才能，进行各种科学研究活动。一年来，社里仅在园艺方面就研究试验成功空中育苗、折插、嫁接等三十多种育苗壮果的办法。全社出现了农、林、牧、副、渔等各方面的土专家六十多人。此外，人民公社还举办了各种集体福利事业，广大农民得到可靠的社会保险，因而发展生产、研究科学技术的积极性高涨，科学研究活动也就更加广泛深入地开展起来。一年来，全社进行的科学技术研究共有二百多项，其中已经研究试制成功和推广应用的有一百三十八项。
    针对生产中的关键问题，干什么，研究什么，发动群众献计策想办法，有计划地组织研究实验，是罗汉公社群众性科学技术研究活动的一个特点。由于科学研究活动与农业生产紧密结合，不仅有力地促进了生产，而且大大丰富了科学研究活动的内容。今年春天，许多小麦发生倒伏现象，公社科学研究所根据老农的介绍，用泡砂石、班鸠沙作锻烧试验，锻烧以后，含有大量磷、钾等物质，用来培土壅兜，能够有效地防止小麦倒伏。全社有一千四百多亩小麦立即推行这一试验成果，培土壅兜一次或二次，保证了大面积丰收。
    在初开展科学研究活动的时候，罗汉人民公社就一方面依靠科学研究所和下设专业试验场，进行各种生产技术研究和高产试验，作为指导和开展科学技术研究活动的核心；另一方面以红专学校为阵地，培养大批技术力量作骨干，通过田间讲座、展览会、现场会、科技小报、短期训练班和大搞试验田等形式，向社员广泛传授科学技术知识，总结群众的经验和发明创造，推广专业机构的试验研究成果。这样，边作、边学、边研究、边推广，就把科学技术工作和生产拧成一股绳。此外，这个公社还充分发扬了因陋就简、白手起家、自力更生的勤俭办科学的精神。没有培训技术骨干的师资，就挑选有丰富经验的农民担任，并请附近的工厂、学校辅导；没有设备，就利用茅屋作厂房，坛坛罐罐当锅炉。
    随着科学技术研究活动的广泛开展，这个公社的农业和林、牧、副、渔等各项生产都实现了全面的跃进。在全社研究成功并推广的一百三十八项科学技术中，包括深耕、密植、防止倒伏、制造土化肥、土农药、电孵家禽、牲畜饲养、果树栽培等。今年，全社共生产优质土化肥、土农药三十多万斤，创造推广深耕犁等工具三十二种、一万二千多件。这样，由于土地普遍深耕，合理密植，肥料充足，又有效地防止了根、茎倒伏和虫害，全社小麦单位面积产量比去年增加34.8％，油菜增加58.5％，早稻、中稻虽然遭到严重干旱，单位面积产量仍然比去年增加23.5％。其他各项生产的发展也很快。
    现在，罗汉人民公社已经制订出进一步发展科学研究活动的全面规划。社员们满腔热情地进行着各项试验、研究，促进明年各项生产的继续跃进。　（周祖佑）（附图片）
