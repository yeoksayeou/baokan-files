Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 28th: Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has overfulfilled this year's production tasks ahead of schedule. The total output value plan was completed thirty-two days ahead of schedule, and the output plans for major products such as iron, steel, steel materials, and refractory materials were completed from thirty-two to five days ahead of schedule. The quality of all products has improved.

Since the beginning of this year, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has continuously organized mass-based, sustained high-yield campaigns, consolidating each step of production improvement and continuously reaching new levels. The daily steel production level in the first twenty-five days of December has increased nearly doubled compared to August, and steel materials have increased by more than doubled.

One of the main reasons for Chongqing Steel's sustained high yield is the continuous mobilization of employees to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution aimed at the key to production. Employees have put forward 76,000 relatively significant innovation suggestions, created more than 20,000 relatively significant new records, and promoted more than 3,800 advanced experiences. In the first and fourth quarters, the sulfur content of the local iron used in the steelmaking workshops affected the quality and output of steel, as well as the lifespan of the furnace. The workshops mobilized employees to fight against high sulfur. Employees experimented and summarized, creating a complete set of sulfur-reducing experiences from raw material management to smelting, which greatly improved the desulfurization efficiency, reaching a maximum of over 90%, and shortened the smelting time of open-hearth furnaces and converters, creating favorable conditions for improving steel production and quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 28th: Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule. The annual total output value plan was completed on December 12th, the steel output plan was completed sixty-four days ahead of schedule, the pig iron output was completed forty-two days ahead of schedule, the iron ore was completed thirty-nine days ahead of schedule, and the steel materials were completed thirty-seven days ahead of schedule. The annual plans for local coke, sintered ore, and capital construction investment have also been completed ahead of schedule. The quality of all products has been significantly improved. Under the condition of using completely local coke, the average utilization coefficient of medium and small blast furnaces reached 1.221, and the average coke ratio was 0.804; the production cost of small blast furnaces was reduced by 15.89% compared with the plan.

Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking and ironmaking production tasks this year have greatly increased compared to last year, and steel rolling production has started from scratch. The Party committees of various factories and mines have boldly mobilized employees to carry out competitions and engage in technical innovation around the key to production, maintaining a sustained leap forward in steel production.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 28th: Henan Anyang Iron and Steel Company has overfulfilled this year's national plan ahead of schedule. As of December 27th, the total output value was 105.59%, pig iron was 103.3%, steel was 101.4%, and steel materials were 103.11%; the qualification rates of pig iron, steel, and steel materials all reached the planned targets. Annual planned output targets for ore, coke, and other items have also been overfulfilled, the blast furnace utilization coefficient has increased by 0.072 compared to the plan, and labor productivity has exceeded 7.18% by the end of November this year.

Anyang Iron and Steel Company started construction in August last year. This year, some mining, coking, ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling system projects have been put into production one after another, initially forming a medium-sized iron and steel complex. While constructing and producing simultaneously, the company has made every effort to create conditions for production, ensuring that planning is grasped every day from top to bottom, and production analysis is carried out daily, ensuring the continuous rise of production levels.

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, December 28th: Employees of Dalian Steel Plant completed this year's steel output plan twenty-four days ahead of schedule. The qualification rate of steel reached 98.45%, exceeding the planned target, the production cost was reduced by 0.5% compared to the plan, and the total output value also completed the plan ahead of schedule. The average utilization coefficient of electric furnace cold charging reached 38.061 tons, an increase of 8.1 tons compared to last year.

The Party committee of this factory adhered to putting politics in command in production, vigorously carried out mass movements, and widely launched rival competitions and technical performance competitions among employees to establish pacesetters and catch up with pacesetters, continuously expanding the ranks of advanced producers. At the same time, it tested and promoted seventeen new technologies such as mixed steelmaking and coal-oxygen assisted melting, summarized and promoted more than 170 advanced experiences, and realized more than 1,000 rationalization proposals, which repeatedly increased the amount of electric furnace charging and repeatedly shortened the smelting time, forming a new situation in which production increased month by month.

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, December 28th: Fushun Coal Mine has achieved this year's production plan ahead of schedule. As of December 20th, the mine's raw coal output has exceeded the annual plan by more than 480,000 tons, and tunneling has exceeded more than 3,000 meters. The open-pit stripping volume has increased by more than 12% compared to the entire year last year; the annual planned indicators for total output value, quality, and cost reduction have also been overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

Fushun Coal Mine has made a high-speed and comprehensive leap forward this year. At the beginning of this year, the Fushun Municipal Party Committee and the Fushun Mining Area Party Committee launched a mass movement to carry out a three-month coal seizing battle, laying the foundation for the victorious confidence and foundation for completing the annual plan. At the same time, Party and administrative leaders of the municipal and mining area led more than 3,000 cadres deep into the mines, adopting the method of "inserting a pole to the bottom," explaining the situation and tasks to the masses, and organizing competitions. Then, according to the situation exposed in the continuous leap forward, they strengthened the main links that play a decisive role in coal mine production, such as equipment maintenance and management of large workfaces, ensuring the leap forward of both stripping and tunneling.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 28th: Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, one of China's largest heavy equipment manufacturing plants, has comprehensively completed the national plan ten days ahead of schedule. This factory, which mainly manufactures various large-scale equipment, has created the highest production level in its history this year. The total output value was 119.6%, an increase of 25.11% compared to last year, the commodity output value was 117.68%, an increase of 24.14% compared to last year; the output of machinery products was 100.95%, an increase of 33.2% compared to last year; all 123 major products, including large-scale rolling mill metallurgical equipment, ball mill crushing equipment of various specifications, and power generation supporting equipment, were completed; the profit plan handed over to the state was completed 135%. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has also successfully trial-produced sixty-six new large and advanced products.

Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant encountered difficulties due to insufficient equipment at the beginning of this year. Because the factory's Party committee led employees to carry out the double leap forward thousand-unit-hour red flag competition movement, they broke through the difficulties of insufficient equipment and rushed to produce a batch of key equipment urgently needed by the state in a timely manner. After the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, the enthusiasm of all employees in the factory was even higher; leaders at all levels also actively improved production organization work and went deep into the front line of production, working and living with the masses. As a result of the concerted efforts of the entire factory, the production level continued to improve, thus ensuring the completion of the annual production tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, December 28th: As of the 25th of this month, Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant has completed the annual manufacturing tasks of locomotives and freight cars ahead of schedule, overfulfilling the plan in terms of both quantity and quality. Other annual planned indicators such as total output value and cost reduction have also been overfulfilled.

This factory undertakes the major task of supplying locomotives and freight cars to railways across the country. In order to complete this arduous and glorious task, the factory's Party committee has consistently adhered to carrying out mass movements, mobilizing the masses to vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, and constantly breaking through production difficulties over the past year.
