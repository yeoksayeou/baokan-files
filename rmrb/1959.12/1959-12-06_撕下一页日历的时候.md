When tearing off a page of the calendar
Su Shaoren

	Tearing off a page of the calendar is a very simple thing. However, this tear also means that another twenty-four hours have passed, which is extremely not simple! In just twenty-four hours, what tremendous changes have taken place in the face of the motherland! How many more milestones has the socialist cause of the motherland leaped forward! How many more miracles have the workers created! Tens of thousands of tons of steel have flowed out of the furnace, tens of millions of catties of grain have been transported into the national granary, how many machines, airplanes, and cars have left the production workshop... And we, each of us, when a day has passed, have we checked ourselves: "What did I do today?" "Did I become the master of time, or did I become a slave to time?"

	Ni Haibao, a weaving expert at the Shanghai No. 9 State Cotton Mill, in order to shorten the shuttle changing time from 2.7 seconds to 1.8 seconds, just to win 0.9 seconds of time, she exhausted her efforts and tried every means to create a set of high-speed shuttle changing methods. And in the hands of Li Rong, a letter-sorting expert in Harbin, in one minute, she sorted one hundred and seventy-six letters for the country and the people. One minute, in the eyes of some people, is not worth calculating. How many minutes do they waste in idle chatter! But in the eyes of the heroic pacesetters who are truly dedicated to socialist construction, one minute is extremely not simple, one minute can do many things, and even winning one more minute determines the victory in the production competition. Facing such heroic miracles, how can we, who do not fully utilize time and control time, not feel ashamed and seek to understand the meaning of time more deeply!

	The most important wealth in the world is people, and the most precious thing for people is life. What is life calculated by? Time. It can be seen how significant time is to our lives and to the development of the entire society! Today, when we are carrying out socialist construction, winning time is victory. Time for us is steel, is grain, is everything. Whether to seize time and race against every second, or to waste time and muddle through, whether to achieve more, faster, better, and more economically, or less, slower, worse, and more expensively, this is a matter of two positions and two roads: revolution versus non-revolution, socialism versus capitalism.

	We should learn from the heroic pacesetters who walk ahead of time, cherish time as we cherish our own lives. Life cannot be taken lightly, and time cannot be wasted. We must make every minute of time listen to our command and make great achievements for us. The Party is calling on us to seize the last month and comprehensively complete the annual plan. "Seizing the last month" is also precisely a matter of time. Time is advancing, we must catch up with it!

    撕下一页日历的时候
    苏少壬
    随手撕下一张日历，这是再简单不过的事。但是，这一撕也意味着又送走了二十四小时的时间，这却是极不简单的！仅仅是二十四小时的时间，祖国的面貌又起了怎样巨大的变化！祖国的社会主义事业又跃进了多少里程！劳动者又创造了多少奇迹！几万吨钢又流出了熔炉，几千万斤的粮食又运进了国家仓库，多少架机器、飞机、汽车离开了生产的车间……而我们，每一个人，当一天过去了，有没有检查一下自己：“我今天做了什么？”“我当了时间的主人，还是做了时间的奴隶？”
    上海国棉九厂的织布能手倪海宝，为了把换梭的时间从二点七秒缩短到一点八秒，仅仅是为了争取零点九秒的时间，她都费尽心血，想方设法创造了一套高速换梭法。而一分钟在哈尔滨拣信能手李荣的手上，她为国家和人民拣了一百七十六封信。一分钟，在某些人看来是不值得计较的。他们在闲扯中不知浪费了多少一分钟呢！但在真正献身于社会主义建设的英雄标兵看来，一分钟却极不简单，一分钟能做出许多事情，甚至就是多争取了一分钟，决定了生产竞赛中的胜利。对着这样英雄的奇迹，我们还不会充分利用时间、支配时间的人，怎么不会感到惭愧，而求再深刻地理解一下时间的意义呢！
    世界上最重要的财富是人，而人最宝贵的东西是生命，生命用什么计算呢？时间。可见时间对我们人生，对整个社会的发展有着多么重大的意义！今天，当我们进行社会主义建设的时候，赢得时间就是胜利。时间对我们来说，就是钢，就是粮，就是一切。是抓紧时间分秒必争，还是浪费时间得过且过，是多快好省，还是少慢差费，这是革命与不革命，是社会主义还是资本主义的两个立场、两条道路的问题。
    我们应该学习走在时间前面的英雄标兵，像爱惜自己的生命一样爱惜时间，生命不能儿戏，时间也不能虚掷。我们要叫每一分钟时间都听从我们支配，替我们作出巨大的成绩。党正号召我们抓紧最后一个月，全面完成年计划。“抓紧最后一个月”，也正是时间问题。时间在前进，我们要赶过它去！
