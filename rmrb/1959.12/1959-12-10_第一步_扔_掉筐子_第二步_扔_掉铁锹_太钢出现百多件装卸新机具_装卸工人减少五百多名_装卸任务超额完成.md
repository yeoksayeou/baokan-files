    First Step: "Throw Away" the Baskets; Second Step: "Throw Away" the Shovels
    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Achieves Over One Hundred New Loading and Unloading Machines
    Loading and Unloading Workers Reduced by Over Five Hundred; Loading and Unloading Tasks Overfulfilled
    (Our Dispatch) The employees of the Transportation Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, through vigorous mechanization and semi-mechanization efforts, actively reformed old routes, rationally adjusted labor organization, and tapped labor potential, achieving great results. Originally, it was planned to increase loading and unloading workers by two thousand this year, but by the end of November, not only was there no increase in personnel, but on the contrary, with a saving of five hundred and ninety-seven people, they overfulfilled the transportation plan for January to November by 5.33%, a sharp increase of 57.61% compared to the same period last year.
    This year, Taiyuan Iron and Steel's transportation volume increased sharply by 54% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Under this situation, they first focused on eliminating loading, unloading, and carrying, vigorously constructing high platforms and low cargo positions, and reforming routes. Since the second quarter, the department's employees have utilized the railway "Communist Youth League Station" lines near Taiyuan Iron and Steel to rebuild eight hundred meters of high lines, and transformed the original north-south ore lines, which were over one thousand seven hundred meters long to the iron smelting plant, into five rib-shaped high lines running east-west, stretching two thousand one hundred and seventy-five meters. These two projects alone expanded ore capacity by 170,000 tons. The former reduced loading and unloading time from two to three hours to one hour, increased unloading rates by more than double, and saved sixty loading and unloading workers. The latter not only eliminated the 30% of re-handling and carrying operations caused by small cargo positions in the past but also enabled the unloading of vehicles by variety according to the route, suitable for direct or grouped train arrivals, reducing non-production time by thirty-eight vehicle hours and three locomotive hours per day.
    At the same time, based on the principle of "combining foreign and indigenous methods" and "combining large, medium, and small sizes," with the goal of throwing away baskets in the first step and shovels in the second step, they mobilized the masses to vigorously promote loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization. Since the second quarter, they have created and improved one hundred and thirty-seven machines and equipment. For example, after learning about the advanced motorized shovel from Benxi Iron and Steel Company, they overcame numerous difficulties in equipment, materials, and technology, relying on their own efforts to manufacture two motorized shovels of ten horsepower and one hundred horsepower. Furthermore, based on semi-automation, they improved it to full automation, turning it into a true electric motor shovel. Using this type of shovel to level cargo positions, each machine can level one hundred tons of coal per hour, replacing the operations of fifty loading and unloading workers.
    Currently, with the large-scale commissioning of Taiyuan Iron and Steel's reconstruction and expansion projects, transportation tasks are still continuously increasing. The entire staff, based on a serious summary of the previous stage's achievements and experiences, is determined to further vigorously promote technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, striving to "one person do the work of two, increase production without increasing manpower."

    第一步“扔”掉筐子  第二步“扔”掉铁锹
    太钢出现百多件装卸新机具
    装卸工人减少五百多名  装卸任务超额完成
    本报讯　太原钢铁公司运输部职工大闹机械化、半机械化，积极改革旧线路，合理调整劳动组织，挖掘劳动潜力，获得了巨大成绩；原计划今年增加装卸工两千人，到11月底为止，不但没有增加一个人，相反地在节省了五百九十七人的情况下还超额5.33％完成了1至11月份的运输计划，比去年同期猛增57.61％。
    今年，太钢运输量比大跃进的1958年猛增54％。在这种形势下，他们首先以消灭装卸抬扛为中心，大搞高站台低货位，改革线路。二季度以来，该部职工利用靠近太钢的铁路“共青团车站”站线，改建成了八百米的高线，并将原至炼铁厂的长达一千七百多米的南北方向矿石线，改成了长二千一百七十五米的东西方向的五条肋形高线。仅此两项就扩大了矿石容量十七万吨。前一项使装卸时间由二至三小时缩短到一小时，卸车率提高了一倍以上，节省了六十个装卸工。后一项不仅消灭了以往因货位小而造成的30％的倒搬和抬扛作业，同时能按线路分品种卸车，适合列车直达或成组达到，每天减少三十八个车小时和三个机车小时的非生产时间。
    与此同时，他们本着“洋土并举”、“大中小相结合”的方针，以第一步扔掉筐子、第二步扔掉铁锹为目标，发动群众大搞装卸机械化和半机械化。二季度以来，已先后创造和改进了机具和设备一百三十七件。如他们学习了本溪钢铁公司手扶机铲的先进机具后，突破了设备、材料、技术上的重重困难，自力更生，制成了十马力和一百马力的手扶机铲两部，并进一步在半自动化的基础上，改进为完全自动化，变成了真正的电动机铲。运用这种机铲平货位，每台每小时平煤一百吨，可代替五十个装卸工操作。
    目前，随着太钢改建和扩建工程的大批投入生产，运输任务仍在继续不断增加。全体职工在认真总结前一段成绩和经验的基础上，决心进一步大搞以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命，力争做到“一人顶二人，增产不增人。”
