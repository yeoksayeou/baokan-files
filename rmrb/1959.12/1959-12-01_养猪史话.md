A Short History of Pig Farming
Yang Min

After the establishment of the People's Communes, the pig farming industry has also flourished greatly. Talking about the history and anecdotes related to pig farming will surely be of interest to everyone.

When did pig farming actually begin? This question can only be roughly estimated based on legends at present. Ancient books all say that a man named Fuxi was the first to invent nets and teach people to hunt animals and catch fish. Wild animals were also called "Xi," and the name "Fuxi" contains the meaning of "subduing wild animals." At that time, the hunted animals were eaten immediately; later, as hunting tools and techniques gradually improved, the number of wild animals captured increased, and people could not eat them all at once. So, people began to find ways to raise the remaining live wild animals. Over time, wild boars gradually became domesticated and their bodies gradually became fat, eventually becoming like the domestic pigs of today. The credit for taming animals should be given to the broad masses of people. However, according to this legend, it can well be explained that the ancestor of domestic pigs is the wild boar, and that the pig farming business began in the distant primitive commune era.

The chapter "Bin Feng July" in the "Book of Songs" has the line: "Speak privately of their piglets, offer large pigs to the public." "Zong" is a one-year-old piglet, and "Jian" is a large pig. This means that piglets belong to oneself, and large pigs are offered to the public. The book "Zhou Li" even mentions that there were officials called "Shi Ren" in the past, who were in charge of pig identification, selecting good breeds, and handing them over to officials in charge of breeding—the herdsmen—for feeding and grazing... Therefore, many people believe that the pig farming industry in China was probably quite prosperous as early as the Yin and Shang dynasties, about four thousand years ago. Oracle bone inscriptions unearthed from the Yin Ruins in Henan contain many records about pigs, and among the various animal bones unearthed, pig and cattle bones are the most numerous, which is a strong material evidence that the pig farming industry was very developed during the Yin and Shang dynasties. In addition, the "Yue Jue Shu" mentioned "Chicken Mountain" and "Pig Mountain" during the time of King Goujian of Yue. Breeding farms were even called "mountains," and the scale of them can be imagined.

There are also many records of large pigs in ancient books. "Er Ya" "Shi Shou" says: Large pigs are called ?, five feet tall. According to the Zhou Dynasty's foot being equivalent to 23 centimeters today, five feet is 115 centimeters, equivalent to more than three municipal feet today. Even if exaggerated, it shouldn't be too far off.

There is a line in the "Book of Changes": "Gelded pig's teeth bring good fortune." If viewed solely from a biological perspective, the meaning of this sentence should be: Gelded pigs will become docile, and although they have sharp teeth, they are not harmful. It can be seen that the method of castrating pigs was invented at least during the Zhou Dynasty, two or three thousand years ago. The appearance of veterinarians is generally believed to be traceable to the Yellow Emperor era, and by the Zhou Dynasty, officials were formally established to treat pigs, dogs, and other six domestic animals. The book "Qi Min Yao Shu" written by Jia Sixie of the Later Wei Dynasty says: Sows with short snouts and no soft hair are good. Short snouts mean fewer teeth. Too many teeth make it difficult to fatten. Soft hair makes it difficult to clean. It also says: The pen shouldn't be too large, because small pens make it easier to fatten. This actually restricts the pig's activity, reducing its energy consumption. In addition, "Huainan Wan Bi Shu" records: Adding hemp seeds and salt to the feed makes pigs easy to fatten. The role of salt is to provide minerals, increase appetite, and help digestion. The book "Qun Sui Lu" says: "Feeding pigs with paulownia flowers triples their size." These all illustrate that the experience accumulated by the ancient working people of our country in the pig farming industry was very rich.

There were also some experts in pig farming in ancient times. There was a man named Wei Shi in the Shang Dynasty, who is said to be the earliest expert in pig selection. The Ma brothers, five in number, were all good at raising pigs in the Han Dynasty. People praised them, saying: "Three dukes in the garden, two ministers below the giant, five gates bustling, only the sound of pigs is heard." "Hou Han Shu" also records: "Sun Qi... was a native of Chengwu, and his family was poor... He often herded pigs in the great marshes. Those who followed him to study all held scriptures on the edge of the fields to pursue him." This can also be regarded as an example of the integration of ancient teaching and productive labor.

The enthusiasm of the ancient working people for raising pigs has always been very high. However, the feudal ruling classes of past dynasties not only failed to promote and encourage it, but sometimes even imposed restrictions. "Wan'an County Chronicles" says: "During the Zhengde period, raising pigs was prohibited throughout the world, and at one time they were all buried and abandoned. The Chen family raised them in holes, and then passed on their breed." This is clear proof. According to statistics: In the second year of Xuantong, the annual pork tax was more than 1.9 million yuan. After the fourth year of the Republic of China, the total meat tax for pigs, cattle, and sheep was only about 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. After the eleventh year of the Republic of China, it even dropped to about 500,000 yuan. It can be seen that during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the pig farming industry was also in a state of decline. After liberation, in 1950, the number of pigs rapidly rose to more than 62 million, exceeding the statistics of 1947 by more than 1.4 million. Especially after the establishment of the People's Communes, new types of pig farms and pig-raising experts are emerging everywhere, and our pig farming industry will become more and more prosperous.

    养猪史话
    杨旻
    人民公社成立后，养猪业也随着大大繁盛起来。谈谈有关养猪的历史和掌故，一定是大家感兴趣的吧。
    养猪究竟是从什么时候开始的？这问题，现在只能根据传说，作个大概的估计。古书上都说：从前有个叫伏羲氏的人，最先发明网罟，教民猎兽捕鱼。野兽也叫做“羲”，“伏羲”这名字，就含有“制伏野兽”的意思。那时所猎的兽，随着就吃掉了；后来狩猎的工具和技术逐渐进步，猎获的野兽渐多，一时吃用不了，于是人们便开始设法把剩余下来的还活着的野兽豢养起来。久而久之，野猪渐渐驯顺，身体也渐渐肥胖，以至于变成像现在家猪的样子。驯兽的功绩，应该归于广大的人民群众。不过根据这传说，却很可以说明：家猪的祖先就是野猪：而养猪事业，在遥远的原始公社时代，就已开始了。
    “诗经”“豳风七月”章有句云：“言私其豵，献豜于公”，“豵”是一岁的小猪，“豜”是大猪，这话的意思是说：小猪归自己，大猪献给公家。“周礼”一书上更提到从前有叫“豕人”的官，专管猪的鉴别，选择良种，交给专管饲养的官——牧人，进行饲牧……所以很多人都认为：大概远在约四千年前的殷商时代，我国的养猪事业就已经相当繁盛了。河南殷墟出土的甲骨文上有不少关于猪的记载，在出土的各种兽骨中，又以猪、牛的骨最多，这更是殷商时代养猪业非常发达的有力物证。此外，“越绝书”上曾提到越王勾践时的“鸡山”和“豕山”，养畜场竟被称之为“山”，其规模之大，也就可想而知了。
    古书上还有许多关于大猪的记载。“尔雅”“释兽”说：大猪叫做?，高五尺。按周代一尺相当于现在的二十三公分计算，五尺就是一百一十五公分，相当于现在三市尺多，纵算作了夸大，想来也不致相差太多。
    “易经”上有句云：“豶豕之牙吉”，如果单从生物学的观点来说，这句话的意义就应该是：阉割了的猪，性子就会变得驯顺，虽有犀利的牙，也是不足为害的。可见，阉猪的方法，至迟在两三千年前的周代，就已发明了。兽医的出现，一般都认为可以推到黄帝时代，到了周朝，就正式设置了为猪、犬等六畜治病的官。后魏贾思勰所作的“齐民要术”一书说：母猪以喙短而没有柔毛的为好。喙短则牙少。牙多是不容易育肥的。有柔毛则难治净。又说：圈不厌小，因为圈小易肥。这实际上是限制猪的活动，使它少消耗些能量。此外，“淮南万毕术”载：在饲料中加些麻子和盐，猪就易肥。盐的作用在于：提供矿物质，增进食欲，并帮助消化。“群碎录”一书说：“桐花饲猪，肥大三倍。”这些都说明了我国古代劳动人民在养猪业上所积累的经验，是非常丰富的。
    古代也有一些养猪的能手。商代有个叫韦豕的，相传是最早的猪的选种专家。汉朝有马氏兄弟五人，都善于养猪，人们赞美他们说：“苑中三公，巨下二卿，五门嚄嚄，但闻猪声。”“后汉书”又载：“孙期……成武人，家贫……常牧豕于大泽中，从其学者皆执经垄畔以追之。”这也可以算是古代的教学和生产劳动相结合的一例。
    古代劳动人民养猪的积极性一直是很高的。可是历代的封建统治阶级不仅没有给予提倡和鼓励，相反的，有时还横加制止。“万安县志”说：“正德中禁天下畜猪，一时埋弃俱尽。陈氏穴地养之，遂传其种。”便是一个明证。据统计：宣统二年，年收猪肉税一百九十多万元，民国四年以后，猪、牛、羊的肉厘总共才不过一百二三十万元左右，民国十一年以后，更降到了五十来万元。可见，在国民党反动统治时期，养猪业也是一片衰落景象。解放后，1950年的养猪数就迅速升到六千二百多万头，比1947年的统计数超过一百四十多万。尤其是人民公社成立以后，新型的养猪场和养猪能手到处涌现，我们的养猪事业也将愈来愈兴旺了。
