Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 8th: The Cuban Revolutionary Court today sentenced Del Pino, an agent who had acquired American nationality, to thirty years in prison at the Cabaña Fortress in Havana. This agent, originally from Cuba, was a member of the counter-revolutionary organization "White Rose" and engaged in provocative propaganda activities against the Cuban government in the United States. He repeatedly flew from the United States to scatter reactionary leaflets over Havana and airlifted war criminals from Cuba to the United States.

Del Pino was arrested on July 26, shortly before the million-strong anti-American demonstration in Havana.
