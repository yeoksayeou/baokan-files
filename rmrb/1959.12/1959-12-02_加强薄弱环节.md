Strengthening Weak Links
Su Yi

One of the characteristics of this year's agricultural production is the emergence of large areas of high-yield fields, which is an important sign of the high-speed development of China's agricultural production. However, at the same time, there are still a number of low-yield fields (mostly remote and barren fields) in various places, which urgently need to be strengthened in management and operation to change their low-yield appearance as soon as possible. This is one of the main tasks to ensure balanced agricultural production increases and rapid increases in total grain output.

The simultaneous existence of low-yield fields and high-yield fields illustrates the imbalance in agricultural production development and also demonstrates that there is still great potential for agricultural production increase. Do we continue to maintain this imbalance, forever keeping remote and barren fields in a low-yield state, holding back the continued leap forward of agricultural production; or do we break this imbalance, so that remote fields can catch up with nearby fields, and low-yield fields can catch up with high-yield fields, striving for comprehensive and balanced production increases? Of course, we need the latter, and we also have the strength to realize this wish. The key lies in strengthening the management and operation of remote and barren fields, and strengthening the leadership in this weak link of agricultural production.

In work, weak links are often the links that determine the overall situation; breaking through them can bring about fundamental changes in the overall situation. This is also the case in agricultural production. In Guangxi, the weak link in the high-speed development of agricultural production is the remote and barren fields, which account for about one-third of the cultivated land area. They can only produce one or two hundred catties per mu, thus dragging down the average yield and total output. In fact, remote and barren fields are not always low-yield, and fertile fields are not born that way. Through people's labor, remote and barren fields can be transformed into fertile fields. The reason why remote fields are low-yield is that they are far from the village, require more labor, receive less fertilizer, and are cultivated coarsely. The key to changing it lies in how to strengthen management, among which the most important is solving the problem of accumulating and transporting fertilizer, because this aspect requires the most labor. Universally establishing field manure pits, accumulating and making fertilizer on the spot, and applying fertilizer to the fields on the spot is a good way to transform remote fields into nearby fields. This not only greatly increases the amount of fertilizer applied to these remote and barren fields, but also saves a large amount of labor for transporting fertilizer, which can be used to strengthen field management and basic construction of remote and barren fields. The Muge Commune in Guixian County, Guangxi, has achieved significant results after universally establishing field manure pits and strengthening the field management of remote fields. This year, the average yield of late rice in mountain and remote fields has increased more than twofold compared with last year, approaching the average mu yield of late rice in the whole commune.

Grasping the key points to drive the general is an effective working method. Grasping the advanced to lead the backward is one aspect of this working method; grasping the backward to catch up with the advanced is another aspect of this method. Leading agricultural production also requires implementing this scientific working method. On the one hand, we must pay attention to the leadership and cultivation of advanced units and advanced areas to create large areas of high-yield fields; at the same time, we must pay attention to strengthening the leadership of backward units and backward areas and strengthening the cultivation and management of remote and barren fields. As long as we strengthen the weak links, such as changing the backward appearance of remote and barren fields, we will be able to increase China's agricultural production level more significantly.

    加强薄弱环节
    苏宜
    今年农业生产的特点之一是出现了大面积的丰产田，这是我国农业生产能够高速度发展的重要标志。但同时，各地仍有数目不等的低产田（大部分是远田和瘦田），亟需加强经营管理，尽速改变低产面貌，这是保证农业平衡增产和粮食总产量迅速提高的主要工作之一。
    低产田和丰产田的同时存在，说明了农业生产发展的不平衡性，也说明了农业增产的潜力还很大。我们是继续维持这种不平衡，永远让远田、瘦田处于低产状态，拖住农业生产继续跃进的后腿；还是打破这种不平衡，让远田向近田看齐，低产田向高产田看齐，争取全面平衡增产呢？当然，我们需要后者，我们也有力量来实现这个愿望。关键在于加强远田、瘦田的经营管理，加强农业生产上的这个薄弱环节的领导。
    在工作中，薄弱环节常常是决定全局的环节；突破了它，全局就能起根本性的变化。农业生产中也是这样。在广西，高速度发展农业生产的薄弱环节，就是占耕地面积三分之一左右的远田和瘦田。它们每亩只能产一、二百斤，因此拖住了平均产量和总产量。其实，远田和瘦田并不总是低产的，肥田也不是天生的，经过人们的劳动，远田和瘦田都可以变肥。远田低产的原因，就在于它距村远，费工多，施肥少，耕作粗糙。改变它的关键，就在于如何加强管理，其中最主要的又是解决积肥、运肥的问题，因为这方面费的劳力最多。普遍建立田头粪坑，就地积制肥料，就地施肥下田，是变远田为近田的一个好方法。这样不仅使这些远田、瘦田所施的肥料大大增加，而且可以节省大批运肥的劳力，用来加强对远田、瘦田的田间管理和基本建设。广西贵县木格公社普遍建立田头粪坑，加强远田的田间管理后，已经收到了显著的效果。今年山冲远田晚稻的平均产量比去年增长二倍多，接近全社晚稻平均亩产量。
    抓住重点带动一般，是行之有效的工作方法。抓先进，带落后，是这种工作方法的一个方面；抓落后，赶先进，又是这种方法的另一方面。领导农业生产，同样需要贯彻这种科学的工作方法。一方面既要注意对先进单位和先进地区的领导和培植大面积的丰产田；同时又要注意加强对落后单位和落后地区的领导和加强对远田、瘦田的培育和管理。只要加强了薄弱环节，比如改变了远田、瘦田的落后面貌，我们就能够更大幅度地提高我国的农业生产水平。
