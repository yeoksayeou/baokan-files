    Attempt to Subvert the Existing Regime
    A Group of Brazilian Military Officers Launch Rebellion
    Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 5th: A group of Brazilian Air Force and Army officers launched a rebellion on the morning of the 3rd. The rebels looted five aircraft from three locations, including the Galeão Air Force Base in the capital, Rio de Janeiro, and flew to Aragarças, a city in central Brazil 1,700 kilometers from the capital, to assemble. One of these five aircraft was a civilian airliner carrying thirty-eight passengers, which was hijacked to Aragarças while en route from the capital to northern Brazil.
    The Brazilian government took strong measures to deal with the rebellion. By the time the government dispatched 350 paratroopers to occupy the city of Aragarças, the rebels had already escaped by plane to northern Brazil.
    According to newspaper reports, the rebels, under the name of the "Revolutionary Commando," issued a subversive declaration attacking the Brazilian parliament, judiciary, and various political parties, demanding that the national armed forces support this "uprising." The declaration expressed support for former São Paulo Governor and parliamentarian Jânio Quadros, saying that he represented "Brazil's hope for a spiritual and material revival." Quadros was originally one of the candidates in the 1960 Brazilian presidential election but announced his withdrawal from the race on the 25th of last month. Quadros has been openly praised by American monopoly capitalist groups.
    A statement issued by the Brazilian Ministry of Justice on the 4th emphasized that the government has taken all necessary measures to quell the unrest and that the situation in the country is calm. Brazilian parliamentarians strongly condemned the rebellion, demanding that the government take strict measures to punish these rebellious officers.
    President Kubitschek delivered a speech on radio and television on the evening of the 4th, denouncing the officers' subversive activities and pointing out that the rebellion has been rejected by responsible people from all walks of life throughout the country.

    企图颠复现政权
    巴西一批军官发动叛乱
    新华社5日讯　里约热内卢消息：一批巴西空军和陆军军官3日早晨发动叛乱。叛乱分子从首都里约热内卢加来奥空军基地等三个地方抢劫了五架飞机飞往距离首都一千七百公里的巴西中部阿拉加尔卡斯城集合。这五架飞机中的一架是载有三十八名乘客的民航机，它是在从首都飞往巴西北部的途中被劫往阿拉加尔卡斯的。
    巴西政府采取了有力措施对付这次叛乱。当政府派出三百五十名伞兵占领阿拉加尔卡斯城时，叛乱分子已经乘飞机逃往巴西北部。
    据报纸报道，叛乱分子以“革命突击队”组织的名义发表了一项颠复性宣言，宣言攻击巴西议会、司法机关和各政党，要求全国武装部队支持这个“起义”。宣言表示拥护前圣保罗州长、议员雅尼奥·夸德罗斯，说他代表了“巴西在精神和物质上开始振兴的希望”。夸德罗斯本来是1960年巴西总统选举的候选人之一，上月25日宣布放弃竞选。夸德罗斯曾经受到美国垄断资本集团的公开赞扬。
    巴西司法部4日发表的公告强调指出：政府已经采取一切必要措施来弭平骚乱，全国的局势是平静的。巴西议员们严厉谴责这次叛乱行动，他们要求政府采取严厉措施来惩处这些叛乱军官。
    库比契克总统4日晚在电台和电视台上发表演说，斥责这些军官的颠复活动，并且指出：叛乱活动受到全国各界负责人士的摈弃。
