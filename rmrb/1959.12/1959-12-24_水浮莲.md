　　Water Hyacinth

　　Water hyacinth is an aquatic plant. It has a very high yield; one mu of pond can produce more than 300,000 jin per year. Water hyacinth has a soft texture and fragrant aroma, and pigs love to eat it. It is a good pig feed that has been widely used in recent years. Water hyacinth is best used as fermented feed, but it can also be fed raw, cooked, ensiled, or dried for storage.

　　Water hyacinth is easy to grow, and can be cultivated in ponds and small rivers. Currently, the weather is turning cold and the water temperature is decreasing, so attention should be paid to protecting the water hyacinth over the winter in order to reproduce it in large quantities next year.

　　水浮莲
    水浮莲是一种水生植物。产量很高，一亩池塘一年可以产三十多万斤。水浮莲质地柔软、味道芳香，猪很爱吃，是近年来被广泛利用的良好养猪饲料。水浮莲最好是做发酵饲料，也可以生喂、煮熟喂，青贮或晒干贮藏。
    水浮莲很容易种植，水塘、小河里都可栽培。目前天气转冷，水温降低，要注意保护水浮莲过冬，以便明年大量繁殖。（附图片）
