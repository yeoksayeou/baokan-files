Harbin Dispatch: Harbin No. 18 Middle School, in deeply implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, teachers and students of the whole school are exerting full effort, holding high the glorious banner of the work-study program, and continuing to advance.

Since the beginning of this semester, the school has made proper arrangements for teaching, labor, and life. The Party branch and school leaders are deeply involved in grasping teaching, teachers are carefully preparing lessons, students are studying diligently, and teachers and students throughout the school are participating in labor on time. Currently, in lesson preparation, teachers are, on the one hand, searching for relevant materials and going deep into factories and greenhouses to study practical applications; on the other hand, they are deeply understanding the students' ideological state and investigating their actual knowledge level, trying every means to create conditions for students to study well.

The result of combining education with productive labor and theory with practice has greatly stimulated the students' enthusiasm for learning. Students say, "You regret not studying enough when you need to use your knowledge," and "If you don't study hard now, you won't be able to labor well in the future." Therefore, they are more diligent, and "diligent study and eagerness to ask questions" has become the norm. They seek advice from teachers at school, from workers in factories, and from farmers in the countryside. Students' thinking ability has improved, and their knowledge has become more solid. They say, "What we are learning now is living knowledge." In the midterm exams, students' performance in basic courses has significantly improved.

In order to make productive labor regular and systematic, No. 18 Middle School rectified its internal factories at the beginning of the semester, building a productive labor base that includes metalworking, woodworking, chemical engineering, agriculture, and sewing, suitable for the intellectual and physical development requirements of ordinary middle school students. This production base has been expanded on the basis of the original factories. For example, the metalworking factory originally had only one workshop, but now it has increased to three workshops. Originally, it could only accommodate forty people for labor, but now it can accommodate seventy-five people. In terms of equipment, machine lathes, electric drilling machines, and electric grinding wheels have been added. In this way, the original situation of carrying out labor in groups and carrying out various productions in the same workshop has been changed to carrying out the same labor in the same workshop at the same time by class. With this productive labor base, the school ensures six to eight hours of labor time for all students per week, which is more conducive to combining the teaching of basic knowledge of metal and woodworking with students' productive labor.

The combination of education and productive labor has significantly improved students' socialist ideological consciousness. Students love labor more than in the past, and they love the working people more. Labor has become a conscious action. For example, the school stipulated that three hundred students in the third grade should be selected to help the rural people's communes rush to harvest autumn vegetables, but as a result, three hundred and fifty people went.

### 贯彻党的教育方针　妥善安排教学劳动  哈尔滨十八中高举勤工俭学红旗

    贯彻党的教育方针　妥善安排教学劳动
    哈尔滨十八中高举勤工俭学红旗
    本报讯　哈尔滨市第十八中学，在深入贯彻执行党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针中，全校师生鼓足干劲，高举勤工俭学的光荣红旗，继续前进。
    这学期开始，学校对教学、劳动、生活进行了妥善的安排。党支部和学校领导深入抓教学，教师认真备课，学生发奋读书，全校师生按时参加劳动。现在教师在备课中，一方面查找有关资料和深入到工厂、温室中去研究实际；一方面深入了解学生的思想情况，调查学生的实际知识水平，想尽办法为学生学习好创造条件。
    教育与生产劳动相结合、理论与实际相结合的结果，大大地激发了学生的学习积极性。学生说：“书到用时方恨少”，“现在不好好学习，将来也不能好好劳动”，因而钻劲更足了，“勤学好问”已成风气。他们在学校向老师请教，在工厂向工人请教，到农村便向农民请教。学生的思维能力有了提高，知识更加巩固。他们说：“现在学的是活知识。”期中考试，学生基础课的成绩显著提高。
    为了使生产劳动经常化、制度化，第十八中学在开学初期就对校内工厂进行了整顿，建成一个包括金工、木工、化工、农业、缝纫等适合普通中学学生的智力、体力发展要求的生产劳动基地。这个生产基地在原有的工厂基础上扩大了。如金工厂原来只有一个车间，现在增加到三个车间，原来只能容纳四十人劳动，现在能容纳七十五人劳动。在设备方面增添了机器旋床、电动钻床、电动砂轮等。这样，就把原来以小组为单位进行劳动和在同一车间进行多种生产的情况，改成以班级为单位、在同一车间同一时间进行同一劳动了。有了这个生产劳动基地，就保证了全校学生每周六至八小时的劳动时间，更便于把讲授金、木工基础知识课和学生的生产劳动结合起来。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，使学生的社会主义思想觉悟有了显著的提高。学生比过去更加热爱劳动，更加热爱劳动人民，劳动已经成为自觉的行动。如学校规定三年级要选出三百名学生帮助农村人民公社抢收秋菜，结果去了三百五十人。（附图片）
