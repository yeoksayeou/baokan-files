	New Raw Materials for Enamel
	Guo Shuochuan
	Just as the production of the Fuzhou Enamel Factory was reaching its peak, the factory's black iron sheet – the main raw material for manufacturing enamel – was running out. Should they ask the state to increase the supply of raw materials? Or should they solve the problem themselves? Upon hearing this news, young technician Chen Shijie decided to use tinplate to replace black iron sheet. In the laboratory, he alternately poured out large cups and small cups, mixing cup after cup of acidic liquid into a basin of water. Then, he put a piece of shimmering tinplate into the water basin, watching its chemical changes intently. Because there was a layer of tin on the tinplate, the tin had to be removed before the enamel could be applied. However, after several experiments, all failed. When this unpleasant news spread, some people with conservative ideas ridiculed him, saying: "It is better not to do things that predecessors have not done, it's a waste to experiment," "Someone had already tried it during the War of Resistance Against Japan but did not succeed, you are still messing with this now, really a greenhorn, overestimating yourself."

	Yes, Chen Shijie had not been a technician for long. Before that, he was engaged in supply and marketing work in the factory. When the Party branch secretary transferred him to be a technician in April last year, he said to him: "Our factory's technical strength is still very weak. With the production upsurge, the technical work cannot keep up. If Party members don't take on this burden, who will?" He remembered these words and strengthened his confidence to continue. He said: "Difficulties are both wind and waves, if we want to move forward, we must ride the wind and waves!"

	The experiment restarted. Chen Shijie almost mixed all kinds of acidic liquids, experimenting with a method of using nitric acid to turn metallic tin into tin oxide, removing the tin from the tinplate without affecting the iron sheet itself. Chen Shijie jumped up with joy and immediately took this piece of tinplate without tin to the enamel coating, conducted impact tests, and made the first washbasin made of tinplate. Regardless of appearance and quality, it was no less inferior than those made of black iron sheet.

	Who knew that when a large number of tinplate enamel trials began, new problems arose. Due to mass trial production, the amount of acid liquid used was large, and the acid liquid generated high heat. The strong nitrogen dioxide gas choked the workers, causing them to cough and vomit. The experiment failed again. Could he just give up all his previous efforts? Chen Shijie was thinking deeply when the Party branch secretary, Su Jingde, came: "Little Chen, things will not always be smooth sailing. As long as you don't lose heart and continue to work resolutely, you will definitely achieve victory."

	The Party's care and guidance added to his immense courage. He overcame the last difficulty, using a solution made of dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrate. Through the action of the oxygen element in sodium nitrate and hydrochloric acid, he transformed metallic tin into tin oxide, solving the problem of choking nitrogen dioxide gas. From then on, the history of people thinking that tinplate could not be used to produce enamel came to an end. It not only solved the factory's raw material difficulties, but also played a significant role in improving the output and quality of enamel products, and reducing costs. (Attached picture)

    搪瓷的新原料
    郭说传
    正当福州搪瓷厂的生产登上高峰的时候，厂里的黑铁皮——制造搪瓷的主要原料快用完了。是向国家要求增加原料？还是自行解决呢？青年技术员陈世杰听到这个消息，决心利用马口铁来代替黑铁皮。他在试验室里，一会儿端出大杯，一会儿举起小杯，把一杯杯的酸液倒进水盆里混搅起来，然后，将一片闪闪发光的马口铁投入水盆中，目不转睛地注视着它的化学变化。因为马口铁上有层锡，必须去掉了锡才能搪上瓷。但是，经过几次试验都失败了。这个不愉快的事一传出，个别有保守思想的人就嘲笑他：“前人没有作过的事，还是不作好，试验不好反而浪费”，“抗日战争时期早有人试验过都没有成功，你现在还搞这玩艺儿，真是初出茅庐，不自量力。”
    是的，陈世杰当技术员的时间不长。在这以前他是在厂里搞供销工作的。去年4月间调他当技术员时，党支部书记曾对他说：“我们厂里技术力量还很薄弱，生产高潮来了，技术工作跟不上，党员不挑这担子，谁挑？他想起了这些话，更坚定了搞下去的信心。他说：“困难是风也是浪，我们要前进就要乘风破浪！”
    试验重新开始了。陈世杰几乎把所有的各种酸液，混来合去，试验出用硝酸把金属锡变成氧化锡的办法，把马口铁皮上的锡除掉了，而不影响到铁皮本身。陈世杰顿时高兴地蹦起来，马上把这片除了锡层的马口铁拿去涂里，进行冲击测定，制成了第一个用马口铁作的面盆，不论外观和质量，都不亚于黑铁皮制成的。
    谁知道，开始用马口铁大量试验搪瓷时，新的问题出来了。由于大量试制，用的酸液量多，酸液产生了高热，浓烈的二氧化氮气体呛得工人们咳嗽、呕吐，再次失败了。难道就这样前功尽弃吗？陈世杰正在深思着，党支部书记苏景德来了：“小陈，事情不会都是一帆顺风的。只要不灰心坚决干下去，一定会取得胜利的。”
    党的关怀与指导，给他增添了无比的勇气。他战胜了最后一次困难，用稀盐酸和硝酸钠制成的酸液，通过硝酸钠中的氧原素和盐酸的作用，把金属锡变成氧化锡的办法，解决了二氧化氮气体呛人的问题。从此结束了人们认为不能用马口铁生产搪瓷的历史，不仅解决了本厂原料困难问题，而且对提高搪瓷成品产量、质量、减低成本等起了重大作用。（附图片）
