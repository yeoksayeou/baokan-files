Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 24th - Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, one of China's chemical industry bases, has comprehensively completed the state plan. Statistics as of the 19th show: the total output value exceeded the state plan by 6%, the output of thirty-three major products all exceeded the state plan, product quality was up to standard, costs were reduced by 5.3% compared to the plan, labor productivity increased by 5.1% compared to the plan, and profits turned over to the state exceeded the plan by 17.5%. Compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the total output value increased by 70.2%, labor productivity increased by 28.1%, costs decreased by 17.38%, and the output of major products mostly increased, some by more than doubled.

　　At the beginning of this year, the company's Party Committee organized cadres at all levels to earnestly study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, armed workers and cadres with the thought of continuous revolution, and achieved a flying start in the first quarter. In May, the company's Party Committee criticized the right-leaning ideas of some cadres and organized its affiliated factories to carry out inter-factory competitions, enabling the second quarter to over fulfill the state plan by 9.4%. After the publication of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all employees of the company were even more high-spirited and full of energy, resulting in monthly production increases from August to November.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the company's technical innovation and technical revolution movement has been carried out more deeply and extensively. The company has established 242 technical innovation groups, forming a complete technical innovation research network. In the second half of the year, the company implemented more than 240 relatively significant technical innovations, which played a great role in promoting the continuous rise of production levels.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 24th - Yongli Jiuda Dagukou Plant has completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule. As of the 20th, the output value has reached 102.93%, soda ash production has reached 100.91%, and caustic soda production has reached 102.93%. The quality of both soda ash and caustic soda exceeds the national standards. This year, the plant also used by-products left over from the production of soda ash and caustic soda to produce nine new varieties such as magnesium chloride and carbon oxygen.

　　This year, the plant's employees tapped the potential of equipment in many ways to achieve a continued leap forward in production. Factory leaders went deep into the workshops and worked with the employees to first break through the key problem of insufficient steam generation by two boilers, meeting the needs of increased production for steam. After this key breakthrough, the employees had more confidence and higher enthusiasm in tapping the potential of the equipment, and further measured the equipment capacity of the entire plant, identified twenty-five key problems for improving equipment capacity, and put forward more than three hundred innovation proposals, breaking through these keys one by one.

　　This year, the plant's employees have continuously strengthened the inspection, repair, and maintenance of equipment to ensure safe operation. At the same time, each workshop, based on the characteristics of the continuity and rapid changes in chemical production, carried out "one-dragon" competitions to strengthen the cooperation between workshops, sections, and groups.

　　This newspaper reports - Fuzhou Chemical Raw Material Factory has used indigenous methods to vigorously engage in comprehensive utilization, and production has risen comprehensively and continuously. As of December 12, the annual output value plan was overfulfilled by a factor of one, an increase of seven times compared with last year; more than fifty new products have been successfully trial-produced this year, and production plans for various pigments such as red lead, chrome yellow, lead sulfate, and lead-tin chemical products have been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded; product quality has reached advanced levels; and labor productivity and financial costs have both been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the annual plan.

　　吉林化学工业公司全面完成计划
    33种主要化工产品都超产
    永利久大沽厂纯碱烧碱齐丰收
    新华社吉林24日电　我国化学工业基地之一的吉林化学工业公司，已经全面完成国家计划。截至19日统计：总产值超过国家计划6％，三十三种主要产品的产量都超额完成了国家计划，产品质量合格，成本比计划降低5.3％，劳动生产率比计划提高5.1％，上缴利润超过计划17.5％。与大跃进的1958年比较，总产值增长70.2％，劳动生产率提高28.1％，成本降低17.38％，主要产品的产量大部分有增长，有的增长一倍以上。
    今年年初，这个公司的党委组织各级干部认真学习了党的八届六中全会文件，以不断革命的思想武装了工人和干部，实现了首季满堂红。5月份，公司党委批判了部分干部的右倾思想，组织所属各厂开展厂际竞赛，使第二季度超额9.4％完成了国家计划。党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，全公司职工更是斗志昂扬，干劲十足，使8至11月的生产，月月增长。
    今年以来，这个公司的技术革新和技术革命运动开展得更加深入、广泛。全公司建立了二百四十二个技术革新小组，形成了完整的技术革新研究网。下半年内全公司实现了二百四十多项比较重大的技术革新，对推动生产水平持续上升，起了很大的作用。
    新华社天津24日电　永利久大沽厂已提前完成今年国家计划。截至20日止，产值已完成102.93％，纯碱产量完成100.91％，烧碱产量完成102.93％，纯碱、烧碱的质量都超过国家规定的指标。这个厂今年还利用生产纯碱、烧碱剩下的副产品，制出了氯化镁、碳氧等九个新品种。
    这个厂职工今年多方面挖掘设备潜力，实现生产继续跃进。工厂领导干部深入车间，与职工一道首先突破了有两座锅炉发汽量不足的关键问题，满足了产量增长对用汽的需要。这个关键突破以后，职工们挖掘设备潜力的信心更足，热情更高，进一步测算了全厂的设备能力，找出提高设备能力的二十五项关键问题，并提出三百多件革新建议，一一地突破这些关键。
    这个厂职工今年不断加强对设备的检修和保养工作，作到安全运转。同时，各车间根据化工生产连续性大和变化快的特点，开展“一条龙”竞赛，加强了车间、工段、小组之间的协作。
