    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 13th: The Indonesian newspaper "Harian Bintang Timur" published an editorial on the 9th, accusing Indonesian right-wing newspapers of using Presidential Decree No. 10 to incite racial hatred.
    The newspaper pointed out that these right-wing newspapers not only incite anti-Chinese sentiment, but also use a set of clichés to slander communism in order to incite opposition to the Indonesian Communist Party.
    The newspaper pointed out that the reactionaries are plotting to oppose a certain group in Indonesian society according to a pre-determined plan, with the aim of undermining the Political Manifesto. The newspaper also said that Indonesia's experience has always proved that the purpose of "anti-communist" agitation is always to create division.
    The newspaper pointed out that the Indonesian people are already tired of anti-communist clichés. However, one lesson is unforgettable, and that is that every rebellion in Indonesia began with "anti-communist" agitation as a prelude.
    The newspaper demanded that measures be taken against right-wing newspapers that engage in libelous propaganda and reactionary agitation.

    印度尼西亚“东星报”
    指责右翼报纸煽动反华反共
    新华社13日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚“东星报”在9日发表社论，指责印度尼西亚右翼报纸利用第十号总统法令来煽动种族仇恨。
    这家报纸指出，这些右翼报纸不仅煽动反华情绪，还用一套污蔑共产主义的陈词谰言来煽动反对印度尼西亚共产党的情绪。
    报纸指出，反动派阴谋按照预定计划来反对印度尼西亚社会中的某个集团，其目的是要破坏政治宣言。报纸还说，印度尼西亚的经验永远证明，“反共”煽动的目的总是要制造分裂。
    报纸指出，印度尼西亚人民已对反共陈词滥调感到烦腻。但是，有一个教训是令人难忘的，那就是印度尼西亚的每一个叛乱事件都以“反共”煽动作为前奏。
    这家报纸要求对那些进行诽谤宣传和反动煽动的右翼报纸采取措施。
