    Around National Day, the performance presented by theatrical troupes in Beijing received a warm welcome and praise from the audience. In order to exchange experiences, continue the great leap forward in dramatic art on the basis of the great leap forward since last year, further improve the ideological and artistic level of script creation and performance, and better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Dramatists Association successively held symposiums on spoken drama and traditional opera in mid-November. Those attending the symposiums included playwrights, directors, actors, and other staff members from theatrical troupes who came to Beijing to perform and from some spoken drama and traditional opera theaters and troupes in Beijing.
    At the symposium, each unit vividly introduced their experiences in the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership and help of the Party, giving play to the spirit of daring to think and act, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, and creating many excellent works and performances. Wu Xue, director of "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger" and president of the China Youth Art Theater, explained that the script and performance were able to be continuously enriched and improved because they could not be separated from the specific leadership of the higher party committee and the theater party committee. The theater has repeatedly invited experts and audiences to hold seminars; and mobilized actors and all participating staff to design and discuss together, to achieve the current level. Lu Su, an actor from the Hebei Provincial Drama Troupe, introduced that after the troupe collectively adapted "Red Flag Spectrum," they first sent the play to the Hebei Plain described in the play to perform for farmers, humbly listened to the valuable opinions of the masses, and had a relatively deep understanding of the past arduous struggle life of the local people. Therefore, the performance of this play can more realistically reflect the momentum of the peasant movement under the leadership of the Party and has a fairly strong local flavor.
    At the symposium, it was generally reflected that the theatrical troupes not only boosted the production and combat enthusiasm of the masses, but also received profound education in the soaring enthusiasm of the masses in performing for workers, peasants, and soldiers in the mountains, in the countryside, and in the army. "Red Heart and Tiger Courage" of the Benxi City Drama Troupe was created by the troupe participating in labor and experiencing life in a certain alloy factory in the area. The ambition of the workers and masses of this factory to continuously change the appearance of the factory from scratch and the drive to overcome difficulties aroused their creative enthusiasm. Under the specific guidance of the Party and the help of the workers and masses, the superstition of mystifying creation was broken, and the play was finally brought to the stage.
    At the spoken drama symposium, it was generally felt that in recent years, spoken drama art has gained certain gains in learning from the tradition of national opera. For example, "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger" reflecting the Great Leap Forward, "Red Flag Spectrum" and "Overture to Eastward Advance" reflecting the revolutionary historical struggle, "Cai Wenji" depicting ancient historical themes, and "Rolling White Dragon River" depicting the struggle life of ethnic minorities all have relatively distinct national characteristics, making the audience feel cordial. In the future, it is necessary to continue to conduct in-depth research and more practice in this regard.
    At the traditional opera symposium, each speaker confirmed the correctness and greatness of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" opera policy from the development and growth of their own opera or troupe. The Shandong Province Liuzi Opera, Liangjiaxian, and Liuqiang Joint Performance Troupe used vivid facts to show that although Liuzi Opera is one of the oldest operas in China, it was on the verge of extinction before liberation. After liberation, with the support of the Party, it was reborn and welcomed by the audience. At the meeting, everyone unanimously stated that in the future, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, strive to improve quality; continue to deeply tap traditional repertoires, better inherit the excellent performing arts of veteran artists, and step up the training of young actors, so that opera art will become more prosperous and contribute more to the cause of socialist construction.

    交流话剧和戏曲工作经验
    国庆节前后在京戏剧团体的献礼演出，受到观众的热烈欢迎和好评。文化部和中国戏剧家协会为了交流经验，使戏剧艺术在去年以来大跃进的基础上继续跃进，进一步提高剧本创作和演出的思想水平和艺术水平，更好地为工农兵服务，于11月中旬连续召开了话剧、戏曲座谈会。参加座谈的有外地来京演出和北京市部分话剧、戏曲院、团的编导、演员及其他工作人员。
    在座谈会上，各单位生动地介绍了他们大跃进中，在党的领导和帮助下，发挥了敢想敢干的精神，集中了群众的智慧，创作出不少优秀作品和演出的经验。中国青年艺术剧院院长、“降龙伏虎”的导演吴雪说明了这个剧本和演出能够得到不断的丰富和提高，是和上级党委以及剧院党委的具体领导分不开的。剧院曾经多次邀请专家和观众举行座谈；并发动演员和所有参加演出的工作人员一同设计、讨论，才达到现有的水平。河北省话剧团演员鲁速介绍了该团集体改编了“红旗谱”后，首先将戏送到剧中描写的河北大平原为农民演出，虚心地听取群众的宝贵意见，比较深入地了解了当地人民过去的艰苦斗争生活，因此，这个戏的演出，才能较真实地反映出在党的领导下农民运动的气势，并具有相当浓厚的地方色彩。
    座谈会上，普遍地反映了剧团上山、下乡、下连队为工农兵演出中，不但鼓舞了群众的生产和战斗热情，也在群众的冲天干劲中受到深刻的教育。本溪市话剧团的“红心虎胆”是该团在当地某合金厂参加劳动、体验生活中创作的。这个厂的工人群众从无到有，不断改变工厂面貌的雄心和克服困难的干劲，激起了他们的创作热情。在党的具体指导和工人群众的帮助下，破除了创作神秘化的迷信，终于把这个戏搬上了舞台。
    话剧座谈会上，普遍地感到，近年来话剧艺术在向民族戏曲传统的学习中，有了一定的收获。如反映大跃进的“降龙伏虎”，表现革命历史斗争的“红旗谱”、“东进序曲”，描写古代历史题材的“蔡文姬”和表现少数民族斗争生活的“滚滚的白龙江”等剧，都有着比较鲜明的民族特色，使观众感到亲切。今后，还需要在这方面继续进行深入的研究和更多的实践。
    戏曲座谈会上，每个发言者都从本剧种或本剧团的发展和队伍壮大，来证实党的
  “百花齐放、推陈出新”戏曲方针的正确和伟大。山东省柳子戏、两夹弦、柳腔联合演出团以生动的事实说明，柳子戏虽是我国最古老的剧种之一，解放前已濒于绝境，解放后，在党的扶植下重又获得新生，受到观众的欢迎。会上，大家一致表示，今后要坚持政治挂帅，努力提高质量；要继续深入挖掘传统剧目，更好地继承老艺人的优秀表演艺术，加紧培养青年演员，使戏曲艺术更加繁荣发展，为社会主义建设事业贡献出更多的力量。
