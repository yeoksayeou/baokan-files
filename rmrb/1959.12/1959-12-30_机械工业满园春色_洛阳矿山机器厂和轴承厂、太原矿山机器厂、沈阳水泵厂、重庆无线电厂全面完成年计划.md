Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th - Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant has completed the annual state plan ahead of schedule and exceeded it. As of the 20th, the total output value of the plant exceeded the plan by 0.4%, a three-fold increase compared to last year; product output exceeded 2.95%, with all twenty-four products completed according to plan; product quality exceeded the planned target by 2.95%; and total cost was reduced by 7.2% compared to the plan.

Since the beginning of this year, workers at Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant have put forward more than 7,300 technical innovation proposals in the technical innovation movement, solving the contradiction between thermal processing lagging behind cold processing needs, improving the production efficiency of gear hobbing machines and other equipment, and achieving a production level of one hoist per day. The workers also overcame the difficulty of insufficient equipment capacity by "gnawing at bones like ants," ensuring the trial production of heavy products such as thin plate machines and five-meter hoists.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th - Luoyang Bearing Plant has completed this year's state production plan ahead of schedule. As of December 22nd, the total output value exceeded the plan by 10.8%, product output exceeded the plan by 10.5%, profit exceeded the plan by 10.7%, all variety plans were completed, and the product defect rate was reduced by 10% compared to the planned target.

During the technical innovation movement, workers at Luoyang Bearing Plant put forward more than 55,000 rationalization proposals, of which more than 28,600 have been implemented, effectively promoting production. According to calculations at the end of November, the production capacity of 69.2% of the equipment in the plant's basic production workshops has increased by one time or nearly one time.

This newspaper reports that Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant has comprehensively overfulfilled this year's national plan. As of the 19th of this month, the total output value completed 110.3% of the plan, the commodity output value completed 110.97%, the labor productivity completed 110.6%, the profit turned over to the state completed 116.79%, and the cost reduction target completed 131.03%. This year, they also successfully trial-produced forty-three new products.

Since the beginning of this year, the factory has been holding high the red flag of the General Line and continuously carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. The factory promoted thirty-six advanced experiences and realized more than 31,800 technical innovations, thus making production leap forward again and again.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang - Shenyang Pump Factory has brilliantly reaped this year's leap forward fruits ahead of schedule. As of December 24th, the total production value exceeded the annual plan by 9.8%, product output exceeded the plan by 35.4%, product variety completion was 100%, overall labor productivity exceeded the plan by 20.9%, profit turned over to the state exceeded the plan by 5.7%, cost was reduced by 0.7% compared to the plan, and product quality all met national requirements.

Since the beginning of this year, the factory's workers have innovated thousands of technologies around the key to production, and the production efficiency of each person has increased by an average of more than 50%, and more than 640 tons of materials have been saved, thereby providing a fundamental guarantee for the early completion of the annual production task.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing - Chongqing Radio Factory has comprehensively overfulfilled this year's state plan. As of December 20th, the factory's total industrial output value completed 109.73% of the annual plan, total output completed 102.3%, all seven major products were completed, cost was reduced by 10.56% compared to the plan, and labor productivity completed 118.81%.

From January to November, the factory realized more than 35,000 technical innovation proposals, breaking through more than 15,000 major and minor weak links. (Attached picture)
