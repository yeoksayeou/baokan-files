Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 17th: The Jiangnan Shipyard, famous for its high-speed shipbuilding, has completed its national plan for the year ahead of schedule in all aspects.

As of December 11th, this factory had overfulfilled the total output value plan twenty days ahead of schedule; it completed the output plan for commodity output value and shipbuilding deadweight tonnage twenty-one days ahead of schedule; the comparable product cost decreased by 2.63% from January to the end of November compared with the state-stipulated target. After inspection, the quality of all products met the specified standards. Other indicators such as profit delivery and labor productivity also exceeded the planned targets.

The Jiangnan Shipyard is an advanced collective attending the National "Congress of Heroes." In the first half of the year, in order to compete in speed with the Jinpu Railway double-track project, the workers actively rushed to build two train ferries, the "Jiangsu" and "Jinling" with a displacement of 5,100 tons each. In the past, the factory took 307 days of dock time to build a train ferry of the same displacement. The dock time for the "Jiangsu" was shortened to 29 days; immediately afterwards, the workers shortened the dock time for the "Jinling" to 20 days. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the factory built China's first 5,000-ton ocean-going vessel, the "Peace No. 28," with a planned dock time of 18 months, but it was eventually completed in only 141 actual working days. In August this year, encouraged by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the shipbuilding workers built a 5,000-ton ocean-going vessel, "Peace No. 58," in 76 actual working days, shortening the entire shipbuilding cycle by nearly half compared to "Peace No. 28."

    江南造船厂全年满堂红
    快速造船立大功
    据新华社上海17日电　以高速度造船著名的江南造船厂，提前全面完成了今年国家计划。
    到12月11日止，这个厂提前二十天超额完成总产值计划；提前二十一天完成了商品产值和造船载重吨位的产量计划；可比产品成本，1到11月底比国家规定的指标下降了2.63％。各种产品经过检验，质量都达到了规定的标准。其它如上缴利润、劳动生产率也都超额完成了计划。
    江南造船厂是出席全国“群英会”的先进集体。上半年，职工们为了和津浦铁路复线工程比速度，积极赶制“江苏号”、“金陵号”两艘排水量各为五千一百吨的火车轮渡。过去，这个厂建造一艘排水量相同的火车轮渡，船台周期是三百零七天。“江苏号”船台周期缩短到二十九天；紧接着，职工们又把“金陵号”的船台周期缩短到二十天。去年大跃进中，这个厂建造的我国第一艘五千吨海轮“和平二十八号”，船台周期原计划十八个月，以后只用一百四十一个实际工作日就建成了。今年8月，造船工人们在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，又以七十六个实际工作日，建成了一艘五千吨海轮“和平五十八号”，整个造船周期比“和平二十八号”缩短了近一半。
