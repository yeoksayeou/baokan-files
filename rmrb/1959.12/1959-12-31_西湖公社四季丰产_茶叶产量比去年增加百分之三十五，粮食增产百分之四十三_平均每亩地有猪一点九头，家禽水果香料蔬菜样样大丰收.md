Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Electric Dispatch - The West Lake People's Commune in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, under the unified leadership of the commune, gave full play to their respective characteristics, and achieved increased production and bumper harvests in all seasons in 1959. The average yield of dry tea from the commune's more than 2,800 mu of tea gardens was 241 jin per mu, an increase of more than 35% compared with 1958; the unit area yield of grain increased by 43% compared with the great leap forward of 1958; the entire commune averaged 1.9 pigs per mu of cultivated land, and each commune member household raised an average of more than ten chickens, ducks, and geese; fresh fish, fruits, spices, and vegetables also had bumper harvests. The total income from diversified operations in the commune was more than 276,000 yuan, an increase of more than five times compared with 1958. The output value of commune-run industries has also reached more than 140,000 yuan.

The West Lake People's Commune is located next to West Lake. Here, the mountains rise and fall, covered in lush greenery. The entire commune not only has contiguous tea forests and orchards, but also large tracts of fertile farmland. More than 1,800 peasant households live here.

The world-renowned Longjing tea is a specialty of the West Lake People's Commune. In 1958, the average yield of tea per mu in the eleven advanced cooperatives in the tea-growing area was 178 jin, an increase of more than two times compared with the early days of liberation. In 1959, the average yield per mu of the spring, summer, and autumn teas increased by more than 35% compared with 1958, and the quality of the tea improved rapidly. The output of refined high-grade tea increased several times over the past.

The commune has been established for only a little over a year, so why has the rate of tea production increased faster than in the past few decades? This is because the People's Commune has solved the key problem for increasing tea production: labor.

Tea trees bloom every winter, and in the spring, countless buds sprout and tender leaves grow everywhere. The main tea-picking season of the year has arrived. "Picking three days early is a treasure, picking three days late turns into grass." The tea leaves all over the mountains and gardens must be picked entirely within a few days and immediately made into dry tea. Therefore, labor is very tight. In the past, the tea area was also a rice area. The spring tea picking season was also the busy season for transplanting rice seedlings. In the past, the contradiction between tea picking and rice transplanting competing for labor could not be resolved for a long time. It was truly a case of "picking the tea and the seedlings are old, transplanting the seedlings and the tea turns into grass."

After communization, with the establishment of twenty-nine public canteens, twenty-one nurseries, and twelve nursery classes, more than 1,600 female laborers were freed from household labor and participated in production. At the same time, because women actively studied operating techniques, 80% of women learned to pick tea with both hands. In the past, each person could pick 30 jin of tea in eight hours a day, but now they can pick 60 jin, and the fastest can pick 300 jin. At the same time, the commune had strong financial resources and the ability to purchase machinery, increasing the number of tea rolling machines to 56, and purchasing 37 new electric motors, increasing the number of tea fixation machines, shaping machines, and transportation equipment. These machines and transportation equipment have increased labor efficiency many times over.

The livestock production of the West Lake Commune has also developed rapidly. Now, many collective livestock farms are scattered throughout the commune's dozens of villages. The commune's pig population has exceeded 10,000, averaging more than one pig per mu of its more than 5,000 mu of cultivated land. Since 1959, the commune has sold 5,000 fat pigs to the state, each weighing over 100 jin. In addition to raising a large number of pigs, the commune's livestock farms have also newly raised more than 200 dairy cows and goats. The number of poultry has also more than doubled compared with 1958.

Like tea production, the increase in grain production in the West Lake Commune is also very large. In 1959, the unit area yield of minor spring grain crops increased by 66% compared with 1958. More than 1,500 mu of rice achieved unprecedented harvests, with the average yield per mu of early rice increasing by 25% compared with 1958, and late rice exceeding early rice, increasing by more than 30% compared with 1958.

After the establishment of the West Lake Commune, in accordance with the policy of both increasing commune income and greening, beautifying, and perfuming West Lake, the commune made overall plans, adapted to local conditions, and vigorously developed fruit and spice production. The commune invested more than 40,000 yuan to open up 500 mu of orchards and cultivated more than 600,000 saplings of various trees. At the same time, it planted more than 200 mu of various spice crops. Now, in the Wengjia Mountain area of West Lake, tangerines, chestnuts, snow pears, waxberries, peaches, small walnuts, etc., bear fruit in rotation throughout the four seasons, and more seedlings are growing vigorously. More than 10,000 osmanthus, rose, spearmint, and geranium spice crops compete for beauty, and their fragrance travels for miles. In 1959 alone, the income from osmanthus was tens of thousands of yuan.

West Lake was once called "paradise" by poets, but in the long years before liberation, the working peasants around West Lake had always lived a life of "hard work planting tea trees, tearfully living their lives; when the spring tea leaves fall, the home is empty, when the autumn tea leaves fall, the pot is full of debt." Now, with the continuous development of production, the lives of commune members are getting better and better. According to the commune's distribution budget for 1959, the average net income per commune member household will reach about 600 yuan (excluding income from household sideline occupations). Among them, the supply system part accounts for 30%, and the wage part accounts for 70%. After the implementation of this distribution system, difficult households with fewer laborers and more people, accounting for about 15% of the population, no longer overspend, and the income of other commune members has also increased significantly. From January to August 1959, the deposits of commune members in the commune's credit cooperative increased from more than 22,000 yuan in 1958 to more than 34,000 yuan. This figure does not include the deposits of commune members in urban areas.

In order to improve the living conditions of commune members, the commune allocated 80,000 yuan from the collective welfare fund to build a residential area with an area of more than 5,000 square meters. At present, more than 200 commune member households in the Lingyin Production Team have moved from dilapidated thatched huts into bright and spacious new homes.

In terms of health, the commune allocated 2,800 yuan to set up a hospital with two doctors and six nurses, who usually go to various teams to see patients. Common illnesses can be treated without going to Hangzhou city.

In terms of cultural life, before communization, there were 974 students, and now there are 1,532, and all children of school age have been admitted to school. A junior high school class has also been added. Now there are 208 junior high school students, 24 senior high school students, and 17 university students in the entire commune.

　　西湖公社四季丰产
    茶叶产量比去年增加百分之三十五，粮食增产百分之四十三
    平均每亩地有猪一点九头，家禽水果香料蔬菜样样大丰收
    据新华社杭州电　浙江杭州市西湖人民公社各生产队，在公社统一领导下，充分发挥各自的特点，1959年四季增产，样样丰收。全公社两千八百多亩茶园平均亩产干茶两百四十一斤，比1958年增加35％多；粮食单位面积产量比大跃进的1958年增产43％；全公社平均一亩耕地有猪一点九头，每户社员平均养鸡鸭鹅十只以上；鲜鱼、水果、香料、蔬菜也都大丰收。全公社多种经营收入二十七万六千多元，比1958年增加五倍多。社办工业产值也已达到十四万多元。
    西湖人民公社就在西湖旁边。这里山峦起伏，浓郁叠翠；全公社不仅茶林、果树连片，还有大片肥沃的农田，散居在这里的有一千八百多户农民。
    誉驰中外的龙井茶，是西湖人民公社的特产。1958年，茶区十一个高级社的茶叶平均每亩产量一百七十八斤，比解放初期增产两倍多；而1959年，春夏秋三茶平均每亩比1958年又增产35％以上，茶叶质量更是飞快提高，精制的高级茶产量比过去增加好几倍。
    公社办起来只有一年多，为什么茶叶增产速度超过了过去几十年呢？这是因为人民公社解决了茶叶增产的关键——劳力问题。
    茶树每年冬天开花，春天万芽齐吐，嫩叶遍长，一年中主要的采茶季节到了，“早采三天是个宝，迟采三天变成草”，满山满园的茶叶，必须集中在几天内全部采摘下来，并且要立即制成干茶，因此劳动力就十分紧张。过去茶区又是稻区，春茶旺摘季节，也是插秧大忙时节，过去采茶和插秧争劳动力的矛盾问题长期得不到解决，真是“采得茶来秧又老，插得秧来茶变草”。
    公社化以后，由于兴办了二十九个公共食堂、二十一个托儿所和十二个托儿班，使一千六百多个妇女劳动力从家务劳动中解放出来，参加生产。同时，由于妇女积极钻研操作技术，80％的妇女都学会了双手采茶，过去每人每天八小时采茶三十斤，现在能采六十斤，最快的能采三百斤。同时，公社资金雄厚，有力量购置机械，使茶叶揉捻机增加到五十六架，还新买了三十七台电动马达，增加了许多茶叶杀青机、整形机和交通运输工具。这些机械和运输设备成倍地提高了劳动效率。
    西湖公社畜牧业生产也发展很快。现在，全公社几十个村庄中散布着许多集体畜牧场。公社猪的饲养量已经超过万头，五千多亩耕地平均每亩有猪一头多。1959年以来，公社卖给国家五千头肥猪，头头都重在百斤以上。公社畜牧场除了大量养猪以外，还新养了两百多头奶牛、奶羊。家禽也比1958年增加一倍多。
    和茶叶生产一样，西湖公社粮食增产的幅度也是很大的。1959年，小春粮食作物单位面积产量比1958年增加66％，一千五百多亩水稻获得空前丰收，其中早稻的平均亩产量比1958年增长25％，晚稻又超过早稻，比1958年增产三成以上。
    西湖公社成立以后，根据既增加公社收入，又绿化、美化、香化西湖的方针，全面规划，因地制宜，大力地发展果木和香料生产。公社投资四万多元，开辟了五百亩果园，培育了六十多万株各种树苗；同时种植各种香料作物二百多亩。现在，西湖的翁家山一带，柑橘、栗子、雪梨、杨梅、水蜜桃、小胡桃等，一年四季交替结果，更多的幼苗正在茁壮生长。一万多株的桂花、玫瑰、留兰香、天竺香等香料作物竞相争艳，千里飘香。1959年仅桂花收入就有几万元。
    西湖，曾被诗人们称为“天堂”，但是在解放前的漫长岁月里，西湖周围的劳动农民一直过着“辛辛苦苦种茶树，眼泪汪汪过生活；春茶叶落家中空，秋茶落锅债满身”的生活。现在，随着生产的不断发展，社员的生活越来越好了。1959年根据公社的分配预算，每户社员平均纯收入将达到六百元左右（不包括家庭副业的收入）。其中供给制部分占30％，工资部分占70％。实行这个分配制度以后，约占人口15％左右的劳动力少、人口多的困难户不再超支了，而其他社员也都大幅度地增加了收入。1959年1月到8月份，社员在公社信用部的存款，由1958年的二万二千多元增加到三万四千多元，这个数字还不包括社员在市区的存款。
    为了改善社员的居住条件，公社从集体福利基金中拨出八万元，新建了面积五千多平方米的居民区。目前灵隐生产队已经有二百多户社员从破旧的茅舍中搬进明亮、宽敞的新居。
    在卫生事业方面，公社拨出二千八百元办了一个医院，有两个医生和六个护士，平时流动到各队看病，一般的病不再上杭州城里就可得到医疗。
    在文化生活方面，公社化前学生有九百七十四人，现在增加到一千五百三十二人，可以入学的儿童全部入了学，还增添了一个初中班。现在全社有初中学生二百零八人，高中学生二十四人，大学生十七人。
