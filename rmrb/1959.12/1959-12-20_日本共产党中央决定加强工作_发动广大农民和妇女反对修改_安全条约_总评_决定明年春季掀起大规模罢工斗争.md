Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch: According to today's "Akahata" report, the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee of the JCP have decided to hold a "10th General Uprising Rally to Stop the Revision of the Security Treaty" in Tokyo on December 22nd - the 10th National Unified Action Day, and to hold a demonstration march.

	Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, Nozaka Sanzo, and General Secretary Miyamoto Kenji will speak at the rally.

	The Japanese Communist Party calls on Japanese workers and the broad masses to participate in this rally.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch: "Akahata" published on the 17th the conclusions made by the expanded meeting of the Farmers' Department, Women's Department, and Citizens' Department of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, pointing out the important significance of further carrying out the struggle to stop the revision of the "Security Treaty" among peasants, women, and citizens.

	The conclusion pointed out that one of the urgent tasks of the Party is to strengthen the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" in rural areas. The conclusion said: It is of decisive importance that the Party strives to establish a worker-peasant alliance in the process of struggling against the "Security Treaty" and to develop the current joint struggle organization into a true national democratic united front.

	The conclusion said that Japanese monopoly groups and the Kishi Nobusuke government, in implementing policies of subservience to the United States, are intensifying their exploitation of peasants. Their policies are now obstructing the independent development path of Japanese agriculture. This shows why Japan's struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and for peace and independence is very important not only for workers but also for peasants.

	The conclusion pointed out that rural areas in Japan are now creating a new political situation, and most peasants, including middle peasants, can be free from the influence of the Liberal Democratic Party. This shows that the possibility of establishing a national democratic united front in rural areas is gradually maturing.

	The conclusion continued: Even if some people try to prevent the majority of peasants from supporting the proposition of establishing a national democratic united front, the Party should also link the daily economic demands of the peasants with political demands, and organize joint struggle organizations against the revision of the "Security Treaty" in those areas to raise the political consciousness of the peasants.

	The conclusion emphasized that the Party must improve its work in rural areas, accurately analyze the local situation, vigorously organize poor peasants and agricultural workers, strengthen the Party organization in rural areas, and further strive to disseminate Marxism-Leninism theory among the rural people.

	The conclusion, in discussing women's work, said that one of the tasks facing the Party is to expand the current increasingly high tide of struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to a wider range of women. The conclusion called on the entire Party to redouble its efforts to enable existing women's organizations and groups to participate in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty," to attract women who have not participated in organizations to participate in this struggle, and at the same time to further increase the number of female Party members.

	The work conclusion of the Citizens' Department emphasized that the Communist Party and the working class must attract citizens from all strata to participate in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and free them from the influence exerted on them by the Liberal Democratic Party.

	The conclusion said that due to the Kishi Nobusuke government's anti-national and war policies, the daily lives of citizens are being undermined. Under these conditions, they have no other way out but to stand up and fight against this policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a council meeting today and decided on an action plan for next spring's struggle centered on stopping the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," striving for the normalization of Japan-China relations, safeguarding workers' rights, and demanding wage increases.

	According to the action plan, "Sohyo" will hold longer and more powerful strikes to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty," and will carry out work among people who have not yet taken action to mobilize them to participate in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty." The plan pointed out that the scale of the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" should become wider and wider, so that more and more people participate in this struggle.

	The action plan said that a tide of public protest should be used to oppose Kishi Nobusuke's departure to the United States to sign the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Large-scale marches against the revision of the "Security Treaty" should be held in January and February of next year.

	The action plan pointed out that in the process of the movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty," more attention should be paid to the movement to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations. The action plan believes that a signature campaign should be launched to demand the normalization of Japan-China relations, so that all people concerned about this issue can participate in the signature.

	The action plan also stipulates that a struggle should be launched to frustrate the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to formulate laws prohibiting demonstrations around the Diet.

    日本共产党中央决定加强工作
    发动广大农民和妇女反对修改“安全条约”
    “总评”决定明年春季掀起大规模罢工斗争
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党中央委员会和日共东京都委员会决定在12月22日——第十次全国统一行动日当天，在东京举行“阻止修改安全条约第十次总奋起大会”，并且举行示威游行。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三和总书记宫本显治将在大会上讲话。
    日本共产党呼吁日本工人和广大群众参加这个大会。
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”在17日登载了日本共产党中央委员会农民部、妇女部和市民部扩大会议作出的结论，指出在农民、妇女、市民中进一步开展阻止修改“安全条约”的重要意义。
    结论指出，党的迫切任务之一是要在农村地区加强反对修改“安全条约”的斗争。结论说：党努力在反对“安全条约”的斗争过程中建立工农联盟，以及把现在的联合斗争组织发展成为真正的全国民主统一战线，这样做是有决定性的重要意义的。
    结论说，日本垄断集团和岸信介政府在执行屈从美国的政策下，加紧对农民的剥削。他们的政策现在阻挠了日本农业的独立发展道路。这说明了为什么日本的反对修改“安全条约”和争取和平和独立的斗争，不仅对工人而且对农民来说，都是非常重要的。
    结论指出，日本农村地区现在创造了新的政治局势，大多数的农民包括中农在内，可以不受自由民主党的影响。这说明了在农村地区建立全国民主统一战线的可能性日渐成熟。
    结论接着说：尽管有人设法阻止大多数农民支持建立全国民主统一战线的主张，党也应该把农民的日常经济要求同政治要求联系起来，在那些地区组织反对修改“安全条约”的联合斗争组织，以提高农民的政治觉悟。
    结论强调党必须改进党在农村地区的工作、准确分析当地的形势、有力地把贫农和农业工人组织起来，加强在农村地区的党组织，并且在农村人民中进一步努力传播马克思列宁主义理论。
    结论在谈到妇女工作时说，党所面临的任务之一，是使目前日益高涨的反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争扩大到更广大的妇女中去。结论号召全党加倍努力，使现有的妇女组织和团体参加反对修改“安全条约”的斗争，吸引没有参加组织的妇女参加这个斗争，同时要进一步增加女党员的人数。
    市民部的工作结论强调指出，共产党和工人阶级必须吸引各阶层的市民来参加反对修改“安全条约”的斗争，使他们摆脱自由民主党施加在他们身上的影响。
    结论说，由于岸信介政府的反民族和战争政策，市民的日常生活正在遭到破坏。在这种条件下，他们没有别的出路，只有站起来为反对这种政策而斗争。
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天召开理事会会议，决定了以阻止修改日美“安全条约”、争取日中关系正常化、维护工人权利和要求提高工资为中心的明年春季斗争的行动计划。
    根据行动计划，“总评”将举行时间较长的、声势浩大的罢工来反对修改“安全条约”，并且在还没有行动起来的人们中间进行工作，动员他们参加反对修改“安全条约”的斗争。计划指出，应该使反对修改“安全条约”的斗争规模越来越广阔，使越来越多的人参加到这个斗争中来。
    行动计划说，应当以公众抗议的浪潮来反对岸信介启程前往美国签署新的日美“安全条约”。应当在明年1月和2月里举行反对修改“安全条约”的大游行。
    行动计划指出，在反对修改“安全条约”运动过程中，应当更加重视恢复日中邦交的运动。行动计划认为，应当展开要求日中关系正常化的签名运动，使关心这个问题的一切人士都来参加签名。
    行动计划还规定展开斗争，挫败岸信介政府制定禁止在国会周围举行示威游行的法律的阴谋。
