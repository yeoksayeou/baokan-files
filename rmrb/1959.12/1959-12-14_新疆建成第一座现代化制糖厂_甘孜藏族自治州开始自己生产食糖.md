Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's first modern sugar refinery, the Production and Construction Corps' Shihezi August First Sugar Refinery, went into production on the 7th. The granulated sugar produced in the past few days is fully in line with the prescribed standards.

The workers building this sugar refinery demonstrated the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. They learned technology, manufactured equipment, and installed it simultaneously. Leading cadres and technical workers worked diligently day and night, overcoming difficulties such as insufficient equipment and low technical levels, shortening the construction time by fifteen months compared to the original plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu. The Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province has ended its history of not producing sugar.

A number of small sugar refineries built in Litang, Batang, Dege, Kangding, Yulong, and other places, five of which have already started to extract sugar from locally produced sugar beets. Another six will be completed and put into production this month. The newly built sugar refineries in Litang and Batang have produced more than 2,400 catties of sugar in the four days of trial pressing, with good sugar quality. The Tibetan people are eating locally produced sugar for the first time.

In the past, the Garze Tibetan area did not produce sugar-making raw materials, and sugar was entirely supplied from other places. This year, under the leadership of the Party, the Tibetan people actively experimented with planting sugar beets. More than 11,000 mu were planted in the whole prefecture, and all the trials were successful after careful cultivation. After having the raw materials, the Tibetan people, with the assistance of the people of fraternal regions, used old materials to build sugar refineries in a simple and crude manner and produced sugar themselves.

    新疆建成第一座现代化制糖厂
    甘孜藏族自治州开始自己生产食糖
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区第一座现代化制糖厂——生产建设兵团石河子八一糖厂，已在7日投入生产。这几天生产的白砂糖，质量完全合乎规定标准。
    建设这个糖厂的职工，发挥敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，边学技术，边制设备，边安装，领导干部和技术工人在一起日夜苦钻，克服了某些设备不足和技术水平低的困难，使建设时间比原计划缩短了十五个月。
    新华社成都电　四川省甘孜藏族自治州结束了不产食糖的历史。
    在理塘、巴塘、德格、康定、玉隆等地建设的一批小型制糖厂，目前已有五座开始用本地产的甜菜榨糖，还有六座将在这个月内建成投入生产。理塘、巴塘两地新建的制糖厂，在试榨的四天中，已经产糖两千四百多斤，糖质良好。藏族人民第一次吃到了本地生产的食糖。
    甘孜藏区过去不出产制糖原料，食糖全靠外地供应。今年，藏族人民在党的领导下，纷纷试种甜菜，全州共种植了一万一千多亩，经过精心培植，全部试种成功。有了原料以后，藏族人民又在兄弟地区人民的协助下，利用旧料因陋就简地建设制糖厂，自己生产食糖。
