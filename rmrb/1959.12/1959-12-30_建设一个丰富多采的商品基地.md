Building a Rich and Diverse Commodity Base
Zheng Song, First Secretary of the CPC Licheng County East Suburb People's Commune Committee, Shandong Province

	After one year of its establishment, the East Suburb Commune has transformed from being unable to achieve self-sufficiency in grain to having a surplus of grain, fodder, cotton, oil crops, and fruits. It also supports national construction with a large amount of grain, vegetables, pork, fresh eggs, and other commodities. The commodity value has increased from 20.3% of the total output value last year to 44%.

	In 1959, our East Suburb People's Commune, like all fraternal people's communes across the country, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and higher-level Party committees, conscientiously implemented the Party's General Line for building socialism, and gave full play to the superiority of the people's commune being larger in size and having a higher degree of public ownership. On the basis of the extraordinary leap forward in 1958, we achieved another comprehensive and extraordinary leap forward.

	One year ago, our area was basically a single agricultural operation. In the first year of communization, not only did the per-mu yield of grain increase from 500 jin last year to 700 jin, an increase of 40%, but also the area planted with vegetables increased from 5,000 mu last year to 20,000 mu, with the per-mu yield increasing from 4,000 jin to 6,000 jin, and the total output quintupling. The number of pigs increased from 10,000 to 30,000, and the number of chickens and ducks increased from 40,000 to 80,000. Fruit trees were not only large in number, but also introduced many famous varieties, such as Yantai apples, Dazeshan grapes, Bulgarian grapes, Leling small dates, and Feicheng peaches, and large orchards of several thousand mu and several hundred mu appeared. Commune-run industries started from scratch and established sixteen factories in one year, creating an output value of 3.9 million yuan. Due to the comprehensive development of production, the total income of the entire commune this year increased from 10 million yuan last year to 18 million yuan, an increase of 80%.

	The comprehensive leap forward in production has fundamentally changed the long-standing situation in the East Suburb of not being able to achieve self-sufficiency in grain. On an average of only 1.5 mu of cultivated land per person, we not only achieved a surplus of grain, fodder, cotton, fruit, and oil crops, but also produced a large amount of grain, vegetables, pork, fresh eggs, and other commodities to support national construction. The commune's annual grain purchase and unified purchase tasks for cotton, oil crops, live pigs, fresh eggs, etc., were all overfulfilled by the end of October. The commodity value increased from 20.3% of the total output value last year to 44%.

	Due to the comprehensive development of production, not only did more than 95% of the commune members increase their income compared to last year, with the average income per person increasing from 70 yuan last year to 90 yuan, but also 2.5 million yuan was extracted for public accumulation in one year, preparing certain funds for further expanding reproduction, especially for the early realization of agricultural modernization.

	We not only achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest in 1959, but more importantly, we relied on the superiority of the people's commune to vigorously carry out basic construction. In one year, we afforested 15,000 mu; 71.4% of the cultivated land was deeply ploughed, and more than 80% of the cultivated land was transformed into raised fields; we built a new large reservoir, a five-stage electric pumping station that can draw two flows of water, twelve small electric pumping stations, drilled more than sixty new electric wells, eleven ponds and dams, and dug more than five hundred large and small irrigation canals. The entire commune basically realized water conservancy, effectively promoting agricultural production. As some commune members said, "The land is as well-tended as a vegetable garden, and the waterways are like blood vessels, so how can we not produce more grain?" The "Beidahuang" of Daxinzhuang is a clear example. This large depression, with a total of more than 5,000 mu, used to have grass that reached the waist before liberation, and no crops grew. During the agricultural cooperative period, each mu only yielded 100 to 200 jin. After communization, after deep ploughing and leveling, an electric irrigation station was built and electric wells were drilled. This year, the Daxin production team planted more than 2,000 mu of wheat with a per-mu yield of more than 400 jin. The commune members regarded this as a miracle and praised it, saying, "Beidahuang has become a high-yield area, and Wazi Bay has become a grain store."

	What is particularly noteworthy and encouraging is that the commune has seen the prototype of mechanization and electrification. In the past year, with the rapid expansion of public accumulation and the support of the working class, the number of tractors in the commune has increased from eight standard units to twenty-eight standard units, and six new sowing machines and threshing machines have been added. The number of electric motors has increased from twenty-one to one hundred and ten, and the number of diesel engines and locomotive boilers has increased from twenty-three to sixty. The number of electric mills has increased from five to thirty-eight, and the number of sewing machines has increased from ninety-two to one hundred and ninety-four. Of the 140,000 mu of cultivated land in the commune, the area under mechanized cultivation has now reached more than 100,000 mu, and the area under mechanized and electric irrigation can reach more than 120,000 mu. More than half of the population has achieved electrification and mechanization in grain processing. Some teams have fully realized the mechanization of cultivated land and the electrification of irrigation, processing, and lighting. "No need for cattle to cultivate the land, no need for oil to light the lamps, no need for a pulley to water the land, just press the button and the water flows, no need to hold the millstone to grind," these things that were still fantasies here three or five years ago have now become a reality.

	While celebrating the great leap forward in 1959, we are determined to continue to achieve a great leap forward in 1960. "Look at this winter for next year," we are currently vigorously engaging in mountain, water, forest, and field projects, vigorously grasping livestock production with pigs as the key and the prosperity of six livestock, and focusing on wheat field management and diverse economies. In order to quickly build the East Suburb Commune into a rich and diverse agricultural and sideline product commodity base, we must, under the leadership of the Party, move forward bravely and advance thousands of miles from victory to greater victory!

### 建设一个丰富多采的商品基地

　　建设一个丰富多采的商品基地
　　中共山东省历城县东郊人民公社党委第一书记　郑松
    东郊公社成立一年，由粮食不能自给转变为粮食、饲料、棉花、油料、水果自给有余；还以大量粮食、蔬菜、猪肉、鲜蛋等商品支援国家建设。商品额由去年占总产值的20.3％增长到44％。
    1959年，我们东郊人民公社同全国各兄弟人民公社一样，在党中央毛主席和上级党委的正确领导下，认真贯彻执行了党的建设社会主义总路线，充分发挥了人民公社一大二公的优越性，在1958年特大跃进的基础上，又取得了一个全面的特大跃进。
    我们这里一年以前，还基本上是一个单一的农业经营，公社化第一年，不仅粮食亩产量由去年的五百斤提高到七百斤，增长了40％；而且蔬菜由去年的五千亩增种到二万亩，亩产由四千斤增加到六千斤，总产翻了五番；猪由一万头发展到三万头，鸡鸭由四万只发展到八万只；果树不仅数量多，而且引进了许多名产，如：烟台苹果、大泽山葡萄、保加利亚葡萄、乐陵小枣、肥城桃等，并且出现了几千亩、几百亩的大果园。社办工业从无到有，一年来办起十六个工厂，创造了三百九十万元的产值。由于全面发展了生产，今年全社总收入由去年的一千万元增加到一千八百万元，增长了80％。
    生产的全面跃进，从根本上改变了东郊过去长期以来粮食不能自给的局面，在每人平均只有一亩半的耕地上，不仅作到了粮食、饲料、棉花、水果、油料自给有余，而且还生产了大量粮食、蔬菜、猪肉、鲜蛋等商品支援国家建设。全社全年的粮食征购和棉花、油料、生猪、鲜蛋等统购任务，到10月底即全部超额完成了，商品额由去年占总产值的20.3％增长到44％。
    由于生产全面发展，不仅95％以上的社员比去年增加了收入，每人的平均收入由去年七十元增加到九十元，而且一年就提取了公积金二百五十万元，为进一步扩大再生产，特别是为尽快实现农业现代化准备了一定的资金。
    我们不光获得1959年全面的大丰收，更重要的还在于依靠人民公社的优越性，大力地进行了基本建设。一年来我们造林一万五千亩；71.4％的耕地作到了深翻，把80％以上的耕地整成了畦田；新修了一个大水库，一个能引两个流量的五级电力抽水站，十二个小型电力抽水站，新打电力井六十余眼，塘坝十一座，挖筑大小灌渠五百余条，全社基本实现了水利化，有效地促进了农业生产。正如有些社员所说的：“地整的和菜园一样，水道和血管一样，还能不多打粮食”。被称为大辛庄的“北大荒”就是一个明显的例子。这片大洼共五千多亩，解放前是草深及腰，不长庄稼，农业社时每亩也不过收一、二百斤，公社化后，经过深翻整平，修了电灌站，打了电力井，今年大辛生产队种的二千多亩小麦亩产四百多斤。社员把这当做一个奇迹，赞许不已，说：“北大荒变成了丰产方，蛙子湾变成了粮食囤”。
    特别引人注意和鼓舞人心的是全社已出现了机械化、电气化的雏型。一年来随着公共积累的迅速扩大，在工人老大哥的支援下，全社的拖拉机已由八个标准台，增加到二十八个标准台，新添播种机、脱谷机六部，电动机由二十一台增至一百一十台，柴油机和锅驼机等由二十三台增加至六十台，电磨由五盘增至三十八盘，缝纫机由九十二架增至一百九十四架。全社十四万亩耕地，现在机耕面积已达十万亩以上，机械电力灌溉面积可达十二万亩以上，已有一半以上的人口吃粮加工达到电气化、动力化。有一部分队已全部实现了耕地机械化，灌溉、加工、照明电气化。“种地不用牛，点灯不用油，浇地不用辘轳头，一按电钮哗哗流，推磨不用抱着磨棍走”，这些三、五年前在这里还是幻想，现在已经成了现实。
    在欢庆1959年大跃进的时候，我们决心在1960年继续实现大跃进。“明年看今冬”，目前我们正在大搞山、水、林、田工程，大抓以猪为纲、六畜兴旺的畜牧业生产，狠抓麦田管理和多种经济。为了迅速地把东郊公社建成一个丰富多采的农副产品商品基地，我们要在党的领导下，勇往直前，一日千里地由胜利走向更大的胜利！（附图片）
