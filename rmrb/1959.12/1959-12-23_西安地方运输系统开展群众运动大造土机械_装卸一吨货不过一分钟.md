Xi'an, December 22nd (This newspaper) – The loading and unloading workers of Xi'an's state-owned local transportation departments are vigorously engaging in technical innovation and technical revolution, launching a "ton-not-over-a-minute" (装卸一吨货不过一分钟) campaign to ensure that the average time for loading or unloading one ton of goods does not exceed one minute. This has led to a universal increase in loading and unloading efficiency, by one to several times, greatly accelerating vehicle turnover rates.

Currently, the average loading and unloading efficiency of Xi'an's state-owned local transportation system has reached the "ton-not-over-a-minute" level. Workers at the West Transportation Station have even created new records of three tons-not-over-a-minute when loading and unloading bulk materials and four and a half tons-not-over-a-minute when loading and unloading flour. Workers at the East Transportation Station have universally achieved double-tons-not-over-a-minute when loading and unloading goods such as grain sacks. Due to the increased loading and unloading efficiency, the West Transportation Station has reduced vehicle turnaround time, increasing vehicle transport capacity by 41% to 83% under the same transportation conditions.

In the past, the state-owned local transportation system in Xi'an had relatively low loading and unloading efficiency, with loading and unloading time often being one to two times the transportation time. For example, before March and April of this year, it took an average of five to six minutes to load or unload one ton of goods. Loading and unloading a truck carrying five tons of goods took fifty to sixty minutes, while the actual transportation time on the road was only about twenty minutes. Sometimes, because the loading and unloading time was too long, subsequent trucks would arrive before the previous ones were unloaded, resulting in several trucks queuing up to wait for unloading, sometimes for several hours. Therefore, even if truck drivers and rubber-wheeled vehicle workers increased their driving speed, they could not transport more goods. Transportation workers often said that vehicles were "running in the middle, stuck at both ends."

The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China firmly grasped this weak link and called on all loading and unloading workers in the city to vigorously carry out technical innovations, improve labor organization and loading and unloading tools, and strive to achieve the goal of loading and unloading one ton of goods in no more than one minute.

During the campaign, the masses combined hard work with ingenuity, focusing on the key problems in loading and unloading work, and vigorously engaged in technical innovation and the creation of indigenous machinery. So far, the West Transportation Station alone has put forward more than 1,300 suggestions for technical innovation, and workers have made more than 720 indigenous machinery models. Many of these indigenous machines have been successfully created and put into production. Workers at the East and West Transportation Stations have successfully created various indigenous machines and tools, including automatic coal loaders, indigenous jacks, mechanical fortresses, indigenous cranes, and automatic unloading equipment for automobiles and four-wheeled carts. These new machines and tools are characterized by being lightweight, flexible, easy to move, simple in structure, and easy to operate, playing a significant role in improving loading and unloading efficiency, saving labor, and ensuring safe production. For example, the most difficult task for loading and unloading workers at the West Transportation Station in the past was loading and unloading large machines weighing more than two tons. Because there was no lifting equipment, it required nine workers to use crowbars to push the machine up little by little, which often took several hours, was inefficient, and unsafe. This time, loading and unloading team leader Gu Senrong and others created an indigenous jack that allowed only three workers to load the machine onto the truck in a few minutes, increasing efficiency more than twenty times compared to the original crowbar method and ensuring safe production.

In order to achieve the "ton-not-over-a-minute" target, leading cadres of the West and East Transportation Stations have gone deep into the loading and unloading teams and groups, eating and working alongside the workers, and jointly studying how to quickly improve loading and unloading efficiency under the conditions of extremely limited mechanical equipment. They concentrated the advantages of various loading and unloading groups in loading and unloading methods and labor organization, and systematically summarized a set of operating methods to improve transportation efficiency, including advanced loading and unloading methods such as "moving before loading," "unloading before moving," and "挟道装车" (using a narrow path to load vehicles). The second loading and unloading team of the West Transportation Station used the "unloading before moving" method and created a new record of four and a half tons-not-over-a-minute during a flour unloading operation.

Currently, these advanced loading and unloading experiences are being vigorously promoted in all transportation departments throughout the city.

### 西安地方运输系统开展群众运动大造土机械  装卸一吨货不过一分钟

　　西安地方运输系统开展群众运动大造土机械
    装卸一吨货不过一分钟
    本报西安22日电　西安市地方国营运输部门的装卸职工大搞技术革新和技术革命，开展“吨不过分”（每吨货物的装或卸平均不过一分钟）运动，使装卸效率普遍提高一倍至数倍，大大地加快了车辆周转率。
    目前，西安全市地方国营运输系统的装卸效率平均已经达到了吨不过分的水平，运输西站的职工在装、卸散装物资和面粉时，还分别创造了三吨不过分和四吨半不过分的新纪录；运输东站职工在装、卸粮食包等物资中，普遍达到了双吨不过分。运输西站由于提高了装卸效率，压缩了车辆停留时间，在同样的运输条件下，车辆的运输能力可以提高41％到83％。
    西安市的地方国营运输力量，过去由于装卸效率比较低，装卸时间往往相当于运输时间的一倍至两倍。例如今年3、4月份以前，平均装一吨货物或卸一吨货物需要五分钟至六分钟，一辆装载五吨货物的汽车装车和卸车就需要五十分钟至六十分钟，而路上运输的时间却只有二十分钟左右。有时因为装卸时间长，前车没卸完，后车又开到了，几辆汽车排着队等候卸车，一等就是几个小时。因此，汽车司机和胶轮车工人再提高行车速度，也不能多运货物。运输工人们常说车辆是“跑在中间，窝在两头”。
    中共西安市委紧紧抓住这个薄弱环节，向全市装卸职工提出大力开展技术革新，改进劳动组织和装卸工具，争取达到装卸一吨货物不超过一分钟的号召。
    运动中，群众把苦干和巧干结合起来，针对装卸工作中的关键问题，大搞技术革新，大造土机械。到目前为止，仅运输西站就提出技术革新建议一千三百多条，工人自己做土机械模型七百二十多件。其中有不少的土机械已创造成功，并投入生产。运输东站和运输西站职工已经创造成功的装卸机具有自动装煤机、土千斤顶，机械堡子、土吊车、汽车和四轮马车自动卸车设备等多种土机械和工具。这些新机具的特点是轻便灵活，便于搬动，构造简单，容易操作，对提高装卸效率，节约劳动力和保证安全生产起了很大作用。例如运输西站装卸工人过去感到最难装卸的是两吨以上的大型机器。因为没有起重设备，需要九个工人用撬杠一点一点的往上推，装卸时间往往要费几小时，效率低，又不安全。这次装卸班长谷森荣等创造了一个土千斤顶，只用三个工人，几分钟的时间就可以将机器装上车，比原来撬杠提高效率二十多倍，并保证了安全生产。
    为了实现“吨不过分”的指标，运输西站和东站的领导干部都深入装卸队、组，和工人同吃同劳动，共同研究在机械设备极少的情况下，如何很快地提高装卸效率的问题。他们集中各装卸组的装卸方法和劳动组织上的优点，系统地总结出一套提高运输效率的操作方法，其中有“先搬后装”、“先卸后搬”、“挟道装车”等先进的装卸方法。运输西站的装卸二班用先卸后搬的办法，在一次卸面粉时，还创造了四点五吨不超分的新纪录。
    目前，这些先进的装卸经验，正在全市所有运输部门中大力推广。
