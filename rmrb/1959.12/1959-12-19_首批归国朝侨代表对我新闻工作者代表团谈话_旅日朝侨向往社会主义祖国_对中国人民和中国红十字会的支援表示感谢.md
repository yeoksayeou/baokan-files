(Xinhua News Agency, Qingjin, December 17) The first group of Korean residents in Japan who victoriously returned to their motherland, including representatives Li Shunying and Cui Bingzhi, shared with the Chinese journalists delegation the circumstances of their relentless struggle for repatriation.

They said that the safe return of Korean residents in Japan this time reflects the increasing prestige of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the same time, the victory of this just struggle should also be attributed to the support and assistance given to the returning Korean residents by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the sympathy and support given to them by the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese Socialist Party, and people from all walks of life in Japan.

The Chinese journalists delegation, which is currently visiting the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, attended the welcome meeting for the first group of Korean residents returning from Japan at Qingjin Port Wharf on the 16th. They met with representatives of the Korean residents.

Most of the returning Korean residents from Japan originally came from South Korea, but their love for the socialist motherland led them to return to North Korea. Chi Taishi, who worked as a coal miner in Japan, was from Juchang County, Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea. He was forcibly taken to Japan by Japanese imperialists nineteen years ago. He injured his back in a Japanese coal mine, and the Japanese boss fired him. After that, he lived by doing odd jobs and working as a peddler, with no guarantee of life. This time, he resolutely returned to North Korea. He said that although returning to South Korea under the rule of the US-Lee group would allow him to reunite with his parents, he could only starve with them. After returning to socialist North Korea, I will work hard to participate in construction, and after the realization of peaceful reunification, I will live a happy life with my parents. Chi Taishi's wish is the wish of thousands of Korean residents in Japan whose homes are in South Korea.

A high school student named Park Boxiong said that Korean youths in Japan are eager to return to their motherland. In Japan, they live a life without prospects. Their parents are mostly unemployed, their families are in financial difficulty, and they cannot go to school. A few who are fortunate enough to go to high school and university cannot find jobs after graduation. In Japan, all large companies do not hire Korean youths. After the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Korean residents in Japan had a motherland and a lighthouse. Korean youths know that in the motherland, they can have books to read and jobs to do, which is their only hope. They are fighting every day to realize this hope of returning to their motherland.

When talking about the relentless struggle for repatriation, Korean residents said that for a year, they used various methods to protest against the Kishi Nobusuke government's delay in fulfilling its promise to repatriate Korean residents, holding more than 270 large and small gatherings with the participation of more than 2.7 million people. Since the Red Cross Societies of Japan and North Korea began negotiations in Geneva, the Lee Seungman Group has been carrying out various threats and sabotage activities. The Lee Seungman Group sent a large number of special agents to Japan, threatening to use methods such as subverting trains transporting Korean residents and blowing up the Red Cross reception center in Niigata to carry out sabotage. The Korean residents also pointed out that US imperialism is actually the behind-the-scenes commander obstructing the repatriation of Korean residents. The United States used airplanes to transport many Lee Seungman special agents to Japan before the repatriation of Korean residents to carry out sabotage activities. However, the returning Korean residents, with the support of the Japanese people, the Japanese Communist Party, and the Japanese Socialist Party, carried out a struggle and thwarted the sabotage conspiracy of the United States and the Lee Seungman Group.

Li Shunying and Cui Bingzhi asked Chinese journalists to convey to the Chinese people and the Chinese Red Cross their gratitude for their warm support. They said that the donations remitted by the Chinese Red Cross to the returning Korean residents have been distributed to the returning overseas Chinese before their return, which is a great encouragement and support to them.

    首批归国朝侨代表对我新闻工作者代表团谈话
    旅日朝侨向往社会主义祖国
    对中国人民和中国红十字会的支援表示感谢
    据新华社清津17日电　胜利回到祖国的第一批旅日朝鲜侨民代表李舜英、崔秉植等，向中国新闻工作者代表团畅述了他们为争取归国进行不屈不挠斗争的情况。
    他们说，旅日朝侨这一次平安回国，反映了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的威望日益增长。同时，这次正义斗争的获得胜利，也应该感谢以苏联为首的社会主义阵营给归国朝侨的支持和援助，感谢日本共产党、日本社会党以及日本各界人民给他们的同情和支持。
    正在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国访问的中国新闻工作者代表团，16日到清津港码头参加了欢迎第一批旅日朝侨归国的欢迎会。他们会见了朝侨代表。
    归国的旅日朝侨中绝大部分人的故乡在南朝鲜，但是由于对社会主义的祖国的热爱，使他们回到朝鲜北部。在日本当煤矿工人的池泰硕，家乡在南朝鲜庆尚南道居昌郡，他在十九年前被日本帝国主义者强迫抓到日本去。他在日本煤矿中压伤了腰，日本老板把他开除了。以后他就靠打零工当小贩度日，生活毫无保障。这次，他坚决地回到朝鲜北部来。他说，回到美李集团统治下的南朝鲜虽然能够同自己的父母团聚，但只能同他们一起挨饿。回到社会主义的朝鲜北部后，我努力参加建设，在实现和平统一后，再同父母一起过幸福的日子。池泰硕的心愿就是千万个家在南朝鲜的旅日朝侨的心愿。
    一位名叫朴博雄的高中学生说，旅日朝鲜青年都迫切希望能够回到祖国。在日本，他们过着一种毫无前途的生活。他们的父母多是失业，家庭经济困难，不能上学。少数人侥幸上了高中和大学，毕业后也找不到职业。在日本，所有的大企业都不雇用朝鲜青年。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立后，旅日朝侨有了祖国，有了灯塔。朝侨青年都知道，在祖国，他们可以有书读，有工作做，这是他们的唯一希望。他们天天都在为实现回到祖国这个希望而斗争。
    朝鲜侨民在谈到为争取回国而进行不屈不挠的斗争的情形时说，一年以来我们用各种方法抗议岸信介政府拖延实现朝侨归国的诺言，他们举行了大小集会二百七十多次，参加的人数达二百七十多万人次。从朝日两国红十字会在日内瓦开始谈判时起，李承晚集团就一直进行各种威胁和破坏活动。李承晚集团派遣了大批特务到日本，扬言要用颠复运送朝侨的火车、炸毁新潟的红十字会招待所等办法来进行破坏。朝侨们还指出，美帝国主义实际上是阻挠朝鲜侨民回国的幕后指挥者。美国在朝鲜侨民回国前用飞机运了许多李承晚特务去日本，进行破坏活动。但是，归国朝侨在日本人民、日本共产党、日本社会党的支援下进行了斗争，挫败了美国和李承晚集团的破坏阴谋。
    李舜英和崔秉植请中国记者转告中国人民和中国红十字会，感谢对他们的热情支援。他们说，中国红十字会汇给归国朝侨的捐款，已经在归国前分给归国侨民，这是对他们的一种很大的鼓励和支持。（附图片）
