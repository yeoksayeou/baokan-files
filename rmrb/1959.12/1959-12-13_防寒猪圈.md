    Cold-Proof Pigsties

    The Caijia Management Area Pig Farm of the Guojiadian People's Commune in Lishu County, Jilin Province, has created a simple and easy-to-build semi-underground cold-proof pigsty. This type of pigsty is generally similar to the common above-ground pigsty. The specific method is to first dig a cellar, and above the ground, build a wall of soil (or bricks) around the cellar that is about one-third of the sty's height. Open a door on one side, and then use firewood and grass to build the sty's roof, press it tightly with soil, and leave windows for ventilation and light.

    The benefit of this type of pigsty is that it is windproof and cold-resistant, making it suitable for raising small livestock and poultry in winter in regions with long cold seasons. The results of using this type of cold-proof pigsty by the Caijia Management Area Pig Farm last winter proved that in temperatures of minus thirty degrees Celsius, the temperature inside the sty generally remained around zero degrees Celsius, greatly facilitating the pigs' growth, fattening, and breeding. At the same time, this type of pigsty has a simple structure and low cost; it can be built everywhere and by everyone. Each pigsty generally requires four or five pieces of wood and three or four workdays to complete.

    This underground pigsty was created by Liu Qingcai, a feeder in the management area. In the early days of the communization movement last fall, the management area's pigsties were insufficient. In order to ensure the safe wintering of pregnant sows and the survival of piglets, based on his past experience in digging cellars, he studied day and night and took the lead in digging three cellars and building more than forty "underground pigsties," enabling more than sixty weak pigs, sows, and more than three hundred and seventy piglets to safely survive the severe winter and breed well.

    防寒猪圈
    吉林梨树县郭家店人民公社蔡家管理区养猪场，创造了一种简便易行的半地下式防寒猪圈。这种猪圈大体与常见的地上猪圈相仿，具体做法是先挖一个地窑，地表上面，围绕地窑四周用土（或砖）筑起占圈高三分之一左右的墙，在一面开一个门，然后用木柴和草搭上圈顶，用土压紧，并留出通风透光的窗口即成。
    这种猪圈的好处是防风御寒，适合于严寒季节较长的地区冬季饲养小家畜和家禽采用。蔡家管理区养猪场去冬采用这种防寒猪圈的结果证明，在零下三十多度的情况下，圈内温度一般保持在零度左右，大大地便利了猪生长、增肥、繁殖。同时，这种猪圈构造简单，造价低廉；处处能造，人人能建。每个猪圈一般用四、五根木材和三、四个工即可。
    这种地下猪圈是管理区饲养员刘清才创造的。在去秋公社化运动初期，管理区猪圈不敷应用。为使怀孕母猪安全过冬，仔猪全活，他根据过去挖地窑的经验，日夜钻研并带头挖了三处地窑，修建了四十多个“地下猪圈”，使六十多头瘦弱猪、母猪和三百七十多头仔猪安全度过了严冬，而且生育良好。
