Xinhua News Agency, Athens, December 16th: U.S. President Eisenhower concluded his one-day visit to Greece on the 15th and left Greece aboard a cruiser for Tunisia.

Eisenhower held talks with Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis in Athens. The communique issued after the talks emphasized the two countries' "firm support for the goals of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The communique described the purpose of this organization as establishing a so-called "peace of security and justice."

The communique stated that the two sides "discussed many general and specific issues of common interest to both countries during the talks." The communique also stated, "Both sides carefully assessed Greece's special position in the Balkans and studied the overall situation in this region and the Eastern Mediterranean. Both sides agreed that the two governments should exchange views on issues involving common interests in these regions." The communique also expressed "particularly satisfied welcome" to "the future rise of an independent Cypriot nation."

The communique stated that both sides "reviewed the past struggles in which the two countries fought side by side, and in this context recognized" Greece's importance in the so-called "common defense." The communique said that Eisenhower reiterated the United States' concern for Greece's so-called "overall security and economic development."

Before leaving Greece, Eisenhower delivered a speech to the Greek Parliament. Although Eisenhower spoke extensively about peace and disarmament, he openly advocated in his speech that NATO countries must "remain militarily strong" and "develop and maintain this strength." He also praised the Greek troops' participation in the U.S.-launched war of aggression against Korea, saying it was a display of "courage and heroism."

White House Press Secretary Hagerty, who accompanied Eisenhower on his visit, said at a press conference after the joint communique was issued that "Greece's strength is essential to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." He said that the United States would provide Greece with "all forms of assistance" for this purpose.

    艾森豪威尔结束在希腊的访问
    鼓吹加强北大西洋集团实力
    据新华社16日讯　雅典消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔15日结束了在希腊的一天访问，乘巡洋舰离开希腊去突尼斯。
    艾森豪威尔在雅典同希腊首相卡拉曼利斯举行了会谈。会谈后发表的公报强调两国“坚决支持北大西洋公约组织的目标”。公报把这个组织的目的说成是建立所谓“安全和正义的和平”。
    公报说，双方在“会谈中讨论了同两国有共同利害关系的许多一般问题和特殊问题”。公报还说，“双方仔细估计了希腊在巴尔干的特殊地位，并且研究了这个地区以及东地中海的总的局势。双方一致认为，两国政府应该就牵涉到这些地区的共同利害关系的问题交换意见。”公报还对“一个独立的塞浦路斯国家在将来的兴起”表示“特别满意的欢迎”。
    公报说，双方“回顾了两国过去肩并肩的斗争，并且在这方面认识到”希腊在所谓“共同防务中的重要性”。公报说，艾森豪威尔重申，美国关心希腊的所谓“总的安全和经济发展”。
    在离开希腊前，艾森豪威尔向希腊议会发表了演说。尽管艾森豪威尔关于和平和裁军谈得不少，他在演说中却公开鼓吹北大西洋集团国家必须“在军事上保持强大”并且“发展和保持这种力量”。他还对希腊部队参加美国所发动的侵略朝鲜的战争加以赞扬，说那是“勇敢和英雄气概”的表现。
    随艾森豪威尔访问的白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在联合公报发表后在记者招待会上说，“希腊的强大对北大西洋公约组织是非常必要的”。他说，美国将为此而给予希腊“一切形式的援助”。
