　　It was hard to get the hotel door open, only to be met with those two dispiriting words: "Full." Xilin was still unwilling to give up, saying, "Even a spot in the bathroom would do." The old man who opened the door shook his head regretfully. I reached out to wipe the rain flowing down my hair and said to Xilin, "Let's go!" Just as I turned around, the old man suddenly spoke: "Where are you going! It's so late." As he said that, the clock on the wall struck twelve-thirty.
　　After the old man understood the situation, he said, "You sit for a while, have a cup of hot water, and I'll go see. Maybe I can think of a way." Xilin smiled at me, as if to say: the problem is solved.
　　Before long, the old man came back with two sets of dry clothes: "Comrades, hurry up and change! Catching a cold is no joke." We took the clothes and quickly started changing. Wow! What heavy rain! Even the belt was soaked. After changing, the old man led us into a small room, pointing to the single bed and saying, "You two will have to be careful sleeping together, or you'll roll off the bed!"
　　After sleeping for a while, I got up to go to the toilet. As I walked out the door, I saw the old man lying on a straw mat in the hallway. Turning around, I saw a sign on the door that read: "Service Staff Room." So, we were sleeping in the old man's room! I felt very bad about it and really wanted to wake him up. But then I thought: even if I woke him up, he certainly wouldn't go back to his room to sleep; besides, he had worked hard all day and had finally fallen asleep…
　　Back in the room, I couldn't fall asleep anymore. The old man's kind face, gray hair, and warm actions… kept floating and flashing before my eyes. I stroked the dry, clean clothes on my body, listening to the pattering rain outside the window, and felt an indescribable warmth in my heart.
　　It was dawn. I woke Xilin up and was about to tell him about last night when the old man suddenly pushed the door open and brought in our clothes; he had already dried them for us last night. As he handed over the clothes, he said very earnestly, "Check carefully to see if anything is missing." I said, "Old man, thank you! Nothing will be missing." "Really? Really nothing?" As he said that, he took out a paper packet from his pocket, "Oh! How careless! Losing it would have caused a lot of anxiety." I looked and blushed. Wasn't that the Roman watch that Little Pu had asked me to take to the city for repair? How could I have forgotten to take it out of my pocket last night! The old man handed over the watch and once again urged me: "Be careful with everything when you go out!" I shook his hand tightly, so excited that I didn't know what to say.

    好容易叫开旅馆门，迎面看见那两个令人泄气的大字：客满。西林还不甘心，说：“浴室铺也行啊。”开门的老人遗憾地摇了摇头。我伸手抹去顺着头发流下来的雨水，对西林说：“走吧！”刚转身，老人突然说话了：“走哪里去哟！夜这样深了。”说着，壁上的时钟当地敲了一下，十二点半了。
    老人问明情况，便说：“你们坐一下，喝杯热水，我去看看。也许还能想办法。”西林朝我笑了笑，像是说：解决问题了。
    不一会，老人捧着两套干衣服来了：“同志，快换上吧！受了凉可不是玩的。”我们接过衣服，连忙动手换起来。嘿！好大的雨啊！真是连裤腰带都泡胀了。换罢衣服，老人领我们走进一个小房间，指着那张单人床说：“俩人睡可得老实点，当心从铺上滚下来啊！”
    睡了一阵，我起身上厕所。走出门来，见老人铺着一张草席，睡在过道里。转身只见门上写着：“服务员室。”原来我们睡的就是老人的寝室啊！我心中很过意不去，真想把他喊醒。但是又一想：即使是叫醒他，他也一定不肯回房去睡的；再说，他整整劳累一天了，好容易才睡熟，……
    回到房里，不知为什么，再也睡不着了。老人那慈祥的容颜，花白的头发，热情的举动……不断在我眼前浮动、闪现。我抚摸着身上干燥、洁净的衣服，听着窗外淅沥的雨声，心中真感到说不出的温暖。
    天亮了。我推醒西林，正想告诉他昨夜的事，老人忽然推门进来了，送来了我们的衣服；原来昨夜他已经为我们晾干了。在交衣服时，他很认真地说：“好好清点一下，看扯掉什么没有？”我说：“老人家，谢谢您了！不会掉的。”“不会！真不会么？”说着，他从怀里掏出一个纸包，“唉！好大意啊！弄丢了又该干着急了。”我一看，脸红了。那不是小蒲托我带到城里来修理的罗马表吗？怎么昨夜忘了从裤兜里掏出来呢！老人递过手表，再一次叮嘱我：“出门事事得小心啊！”我紧紧地握着他的手，激动得不知怎样才好。
