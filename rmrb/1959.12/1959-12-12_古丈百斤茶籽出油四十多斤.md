More Oil, Higher Yield!
Guzhang: 100 Jin of Tea Seeds Yield Over 40 Jin of Oil

According to the New Hunan Daily, Guzhang County in Hunan Province actively responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee to increase oil production during processing. With great effort and effective measures, by late November, the county's average oil yield per 100 jin of tea seeds reached 40.8 jin, an increase of 23% compared to the average yield last year.

This year, Guzhang County's oil presses focused on the pressing process, launching a "Two Reforms" (improving pressing equipment, improving operational techniques) and "Double High" (high oil yield, high work efficiency) campaign, which greatly increased the oil yield. The Shanzao Commune, through "Two Reforms," achieved an average oil yield of 47.5 jin per 100 jin of tea seeds, an increase of 14.5 jin compared to the average yield of 33 jin last year. Previously, the average daily oil production per press was less than 200 jin, but now it has reached 500 jin. The 112 oil presses in the county that have already started production have an average oil yield of 40.8 jin.

    多榨油多出油
    古丈百斤茶籽出油四十多斤
    据新湖南报消息　湖南省古丈县积极响应省委、省人委关于在加工环节上增产油脂的号召，大鼓干劲，大抓措施，到11月下旬，全县平均每百斤茶籽出油四十斤八两，比去年平均出油率提高23％。
    今年，古丈县各榨坊抓住榨制环节，开展了“两改”（改良榨具、改进操作技术）“双高”（高油率、高工效）运动，从而大大地提高了出油率。山枣公社通过“两改”，每百斤茶籽平均出油已达四十七斤半，比去年平均出油三十三斤提高十四斤半；去年平均每榨日产油不到二百斤，现已达五百斤。全县已开榨的一百一十二个榨坊，平均出油四十斤八两。
