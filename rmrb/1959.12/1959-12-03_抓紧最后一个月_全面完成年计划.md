Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 2nd: The workers on the industrial front in Tianjin are seizing the last month of this year and are taking concrete measures to overcome weak links, striving to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way.

    Various districts and factories have generally organized inspection teams to check the progress of the plan and promote an all-round leap forward in production in various factories. Through thorough inspections, many factories have made their daily production command and dispatch work more meticulous and comprehensive. Under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, the city has established specialized teams for the production of cast steel parts, cast iron parts, and motor components, inspecting production by product, by shift, and by machine.
    In accordance with the requirements of completing the plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way, the city's industrial leading departments and various materials supply departments are making every effort to strengthen the supply of raw materials and materials from various aspects.
    Many factories are carrying out large-scale cooperation to address weak links in production. Units such as Tianjin Crane Machinery Factory and Engineering Machinery Factory, which manufacture products such as cranes, hydraulic presses, and sheep's foot rollers, have insufficient casting capacity. At the beginning of this month, Tianjin Tractor Factory and Xingang Shipyard and other units took the initiative to make castings and forgings for these factories.
    In the great effort to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way in December, the industrial front in Tianjin is also vigorously promoting advanced experience and continuing to deeply develop technical innovation and technical revolution centered on large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization. Many factories have generally established technical innovation committees or promotion teams to specifically promote this movement.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 2nd: Workers in Shanghai's machinery system are seizing December production and further developing industry-wide production cooperation to ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's national plan.
    In order to comprehensively complete the production tasks of various products ahead of schedule, many factories have decided to concentrate their efforts on attacking key equipment for coal mining, petroleum, and electricity in the last thirty days. Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory has formed two production lines for the two key products in December—the two-meter and two-and-a-half-meter winches and the 1,250-ton hydraulic press—from casting, forging, riveting, machining, equipment to external factory collaboration, closely connected, so that every process is implemented, and weak links have measures. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory established a command post on November 29, and checked the progress of each machine and each piece according to the national plan and the contracts to be delivered.
    In order to ensure that key products are delivered on time, in quantity, in quality, and complete, extensive cooperation is also being organized among factories.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 2nd: Workers in Wuhan's electromechanical system are seizing the last month of this year, striving to complete this year's production tasks and ensure that products are fully matched.
    In order to ensure that the number of main engines and auxiliary engines are consistent and shipped together, the Wuhan Municipal Electromechanical Industry Bureau system recently conducted an inspection and detailed arrangement of production from top to bottom. Many factories have specifically arranged the daily progress of products, parts, and components for December according to the principle of the whole country as a chessboard, and assigned tasks to workshops, groups, and individuals, put forward quality and time requirements, and clarified the persons in charge and machine tools for completing the tasks, so that the production tasks of key products are further implemented. The Municipal Electromechanical Industry Bureau also organized various factories to implement technical cooperation, equipment cooperation, and raw material cooperation. From November 4 to 15, various factories mutually adjusted more than 3,300 tons of various raw materials.
    In addition, the Municipal Electromechanical Bureau strove for external assistance on the one hand, and queued up the tasks, distinguished between priorities and urgencies, mobilized the masses to overcome difficulties in every possible way, and solved the production problem of hundreds of tons of cast steel parts.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: The workers on the Beijing Iron and Steel Front have invested in the battle to win the final victory of the year with greater efforts. The first day of December was a good start. The city's daily output of pig iron on the 1st was higher than the average daily output of the previous month; the steel output of the Beijing Special Steel Plant on the 1st increased by 11.4% compared with the average daily output of the previous month.
    In order to complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way, various iron and steel enterprises have successively formulated leap forward plans and various specific measures for December, and vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. The mass movement of technical innovation, technical revolution, and promotion of advanced experience in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company is developing further. The converter workshop expects that by the end of the year, the daily steel production level will increase by 40% compared with November. The enthusiasm of the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant workers is even higher. They are determined to increase the production of pig iron by another 4,000 tons for the country in the last thirty days and comprehensively complete the national plan. In order to increase the production of 12,000 tons of steel by the end of the year, the Beijing Special Steel Plant has recently been deeply involved in the front line by party committee secretaries, factory directors, workshop directors, party branch secretaries of districts and sections, taking turns to work alongside the workers and promptly solving key problems in production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 2nd: Workers of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company are determined to seize the key points of output, quality, and variety in the last month, and strive to better and comprehensively complete this year's national plan.
    After analyzing the excellent situation of the company's continuous leap forward since this year, the company's party committee pointed out that it is necessary to take a leap in the last month, take the widespread development of the socialist education movement among employees as the key link, adhere to opposing right-leaning slackness, opposing starting strong and finishing weak, continue to mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out technical revolution, and win a victory in the final decisive month.
    In order to improve the quality of steel, the converter workshops in Chongqing have launched a mass movement to attack sulfur in a coordinated manner from the aspects of raw material management and operation of iron-making furnaces and converters. In addition to organizing the converter workshops to study the mass sulfur attack experience of the Zhongshan Hall Converter Factory, the company's party committee also adopted measures such as rebuilding neutral iron-making furnaces and formulating desulfurization rules and regulations, and strived to double the qualified rate of converter steel by the end of the year. In the open hearth furnace workshop, which originally had better quality, a movement to produce more high-quality steel was also launched.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 2nd: Leading cadres of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory went deep into the front line of production to organize all factory workers to work hard in December, striving to complete the annual leap forward plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way.
    The main production task of this factory in December is to manufacture a batch of large rolling mills, hydraulic presses, and powerful nodular cast iron and crushing equipment. The main difficulty in completing this task is the lack of man-hours for large equipment. In order to solve this key problem, the factory party committee had already taken corresponding measures at the end of November. Leading cadres such as the party committee secretary, factory director, chief engineer, and chief process engineer go deep into the workshop every day, adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to rush to manufacture large gantry planers, boring machines, and other special equipment to meet production needs.
    While grasping the task of processing large parts, the factory leaders also closely arranged the processing of medium and small parts to ensure that all products can comprehensively complete the task. (Attached picture)
