Adding Population and Grain, Happiness Lasts Ten Thousand Years
Most Areas of Jiangxi Province Escape the Threat of Schistosomiasis

(Our Nanchang Dispatch, December 27th) Jiangxi, in conjunction with reclaiming lake fields and islets of Poyang Lake, constructing water conservancy projects, and accumulating and producing fertilizer, has launched a large-scale snail eradication campaign, striving to completely eliminate schistosomiasis in the fifteen mountainous and plain counties with schistosomiasis in the province this year. The eighteen lakefront counties with schistosomiasis are also preparing safe living and production zones to ensure a greater leap forward in production next year.

Since May of last year, Jiangxi Province has eradicated snails on an area of 1.6 million mu, accounting for 64% of the total snail distribution area in the province, treated approximately 400,000 patients with early-stage schistosomiasis, and brought 240,000 late-stage patients, who were on the verge of death, back from the brink through long-term treatment. Following Yujiang County's raising of the red flag for eliminating schistosomiasis nationwide last year, this year Wuyuan, Fuliang, Fengcheng, Gao'an, and other counties have also eliminated or basically eliminated schistosomiasis. In these areas where schistosomiasis has been eradicated or basically eradicated, a thriving and prosperous scene of longevity and abundant harvests is appearing everywhere. Fujiachun Village in Fengcheng County was originally a large village with more than 1,200 people. Before liberation, due to years of schistosomiasis infestation, only 103 widows and others with varying degrees of schistosomiasis were left by the time of liberation, and it was known as the "Widow Village." Now, not only have the illnesses been cured, families have been restored, and everyone is healthy, but agricultural production has also greatly developed. This year's grain yield has increased from over 100 jin per mu in the past to over 600 jin. People excitedly sing: "Thanks to the Communist Party, its kindness is as great as heaven, barren fields have become fertile fields, widows have been matched, everyone is healthy, population and grain are added, and 'Old Plague God' is sent away, happiness lasts ten thousand years."

In order to further deepen the prevention and control of schistosomiasis, the mountainous areas and plains where schistosomiasis has not yet been eradicated have recently begun the work of eliminating schistosomiasis again. In lakefront areas, it is necessary to eliminate snails within three *hua li*, establish safe living and production zones, and strengthen the general survey and treatment of schistosomiasis. More than 1.2 million people in the province are carrying out snail eradication work in conjunction with reclaiming lake fields and islets, constructing water conservancy projects, and accumulating and producing fertilizer. A large number of schistosomiasis prevention and control workers and medical personnel from health departments at all levels in the province are going deep into the field to provide technical guidance for snail eradication.

Jiangxi Province is one of the areas with the most serious schistosomiasis prevalence in the country. Before liberation, schistosomiasis was prevalent in 33 of the province's 82 counties. In these 33 counties, the snail-infested area reached 2.5 million mu, and a total of 500,000 people were infected with schistosomiasis, threatening the lives of millions of people. After liberation, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China led the people of the province in a resolute struggle against schistosomiasis, thus fundamentally changing the poor and backward face of the schistosomiasis-affected areas. In the prevention and control of schistosomiasis, many good experiences have been created. First, the leadership of the Party was strengthened, and adherence to putting politics in command. On the basis of the achievements made in the past, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made plans for further carrying out political and ideological work and organizational work for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis at the beginning of this year. On the one hand, it strengthened ideological education against rightism and encouraged hard work among cadres and the masses, so that cadres and the masses deeply understood the relationship between schistosomiasis prevention and production, life, work, and study, and criticized the thinking of a few people who did not care about and did not pay attention to the work of schistosomiasis prevention and control. On the other hand, it strengthened the organizational leadership of this work, improved the command organizations for schistosomiasis prevention and control at all levels, and designated the first secretary or secretary of the local party organization as the commander-in-chief to unify leadership, unified arrangement, and unified inspection. At the same time, the whole Party was mobilized, and all the people were mobilized to carry out mass movements on a large scale. In the process of mobilizing the masses, party organizations at all levels focused on propaganda and education, inspection and evaluation, and red flag competitions, and grasped typical examples, established the opposing sides of advanced and backward, so that the momentum of the mass movement became larger and larger, and advanced counties, communes, and brigades continued to emerge, so that the work of schistosomiasis prevention and control truly achieved the requirements of treating more patients, eradicating snails faster, better quality of work, and shorter time required. At the same time, work started from production everywhere and was closely combined with production. The Party organization also helped to summarize the experience of mutual promotion of production and prevention and control work in the field and promoted it in a timely manner. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee also proposed that cadres in prevention and control areas engage in experimental fields for a common leap forward in production and prevention and control, and draw experience from them. Party organizations and secretaries at all levels in Anyi County built more than 200 such experimental fields, which greatly promoted the progress of production and schistosomiasis prevention work. In prevention and control, methods that were mainly local, combining local and foreign methods, and combining Chinese and Western medicine were adopted. Jiangxi Province summarized and promoted the experience of opening new ditches, filling old ditches, and removing weeds and using fire to eliminate snails, which came from the masses. Practice has proved that the promotion of these simple and easy methods is effective and inexpensive. In terms of treatment, many Chinese medicines, secret recipes, and effective prescriptions were collected from the masses, and they were all very effective when used. At present, hundreds of Chinese medicine practitioners in the province have participated in schistosomiasis prevention work, and have contributed many secret recipes and effective prescriptions.

In order to completely and thoroughly eliminate schistosomiasis and do a good job in carrying out schistosomiasis prevention work this winter and next spring, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires party committees at all levels to continue to strengthen their leadership over schistosomiasis prevention work, earnestly use effective experience, and ensure that schistosomiasis is completely eliminated in mountainous and plain areas throughout the province next year, and that safe living and production zones are established in lakefront areas.

　　添丁又添粮　幸福万年长
    江西大部地区摆脱血吸虫病的威胁
    本报南昌27日电　江西结合开垦鄱阳湖的湖田洲地，兴修水利和积肥造肥，展开了大规模的灭螺工作，力争今年全省十五个有血吸虫病的山区县和平原县完全消灭血吸虫病，十八个滨湖区有血吸虫病的县也都作好生活生产安全圈，以保证明年生产获得更大跃进。
    江西省自去年5月以来，共消灭钉螺面积达一百六十万亩，占全省钉螺分布面积的64％，医治了患有初期血吸虫病人约四十万人，并使二十四万气息奄奄的晚期病人，经过长期治疗之后，转危为安。继去年余江县在全国竖起消灭血吸虫病的红旗后，今年以来又有婺源、浮梁、丰城、高安等县消灭或基本消灭了血吸虫病。在这些根治或基本根治了血吸虫病的地区，现在到处出现了人寿年丰、欣欣向荣的兴旺气象。丰城县傅家村原是一个有一千二百多人的大村庄，解放前由于连年遭受血吸虫病的侵害，到解放时只剩下患有不同程度血吸虫病的寡妇等一百零三人，被人称为“寡妇村”；现在不仅治好了病，家庭恢复，人人身体健康，而且农业生产也获得了很大的发展，今年粮食产量，由过去亩产一百来斤增加到了六百多斤。人们激动地高歌：“感谢共产党，恩情同天样，荒田变良田，寡妇配成双，人人身体健，添丁又添粮，送掉‘老瘟神’，幸福万年长”。
    为了进一步深入地开展血吸虫病的防治工作，尚未根治血吸虫病的山区和平原，最近再度开始消灭血吸虫病的工作。滨湖地区要消灭三华里以内的钉螺，建立生活生产安全圈和加强对血吸虫病的普查、普治工作。全省有一百二十多万人，在开垦湖田洲地、兴修水利和积肥造肥中，结合开展灭螺工作。全省各级卫生部门大批防治血吸虫病工作人员和医疗人员，深入现场，进行灭螺的技术指导。
    江西省是全国血吸虫病流行最严重的地区之一。解放前全省八十二个县就有三十三个县流行血吸虫病。在这三十三个县中，钉螺面积达二百五十万亩，患血吸虫病的人共有五十万人，并威胁着几百万人的生命。解放后，中共江西省委领导全省人民与血吸虫病展开了坚决的斗争，从而基本改变了血吸虫病地区的贫困、落后的面貌。在防治血吸虫病工作中，创造了许多好的经验。首先，加强了党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。中共江西省委在过去所取得的成绩的基础上，今年年初作好了进一步开展防治血吸虫病工作的政治思想工作和组织工作的规划，一方面在干部和群众中加强反右倾、鼓干劲的思想教育，使干部和群众深刻认识到血防与生产、生活、工作、学习的关系，批判了少数人不关心和不重视防治血吸虫病工作的思想；另一方面又加强这一工作的组织领导，健全了各级防治血吸虫病指挥机构，指定各地党组织第一书记或书记任总指挥，统一领导、统一安排、统一检查。同时，全党动手，全民动员，大搞群众运动。各级党组织在发动群众过程中，抓宣传教育，抓检查评比和红旗竞赛，抓典型，树立先进和落后的对立面，从而使群众运动的声势越来越大，不断地出现先进县、公社和大队，使防治血吸虫病工作真正达到了治疗病人多、灭螺进度快、工作质量好、需要时间短的要求。同时，工作处处从生产出发，密切结合生产，党组织并帮助实地总结了生产和防治工作互相促进的经验，及时予以推广。江西省委还在防治地区的干部中提出大搞生产和防治共同跃进的试验田，从中吸取经验。安义县各级党组织及书记就搞了二百多处这种试验田，大大推动了生产和血防工作的进展。在防治中采取以土为主，土洋并举，中西医结合的办法，江西省总结和推广了来自群众的开新沟、填旧沟和铲光杂草、用火烧消灭钉螺等经验，实践证明推广这些简便易行的方法，效果既好花钱又少。在治疗上，从群众中收集了许多中药、秘方和验方，使用起来都十分有效。现在全省已有数百名中医参加了血防工作，并且献出了不少的秘方和验方。
    为了全部和彻底消灭血吸虫病，做好开展今冬明春血防工作，中共江西省委要求各级党委继续加强对血防工作的领导，认真运用行之有效的经验，保证明年全省在山区、平原地区彻底消灭血吸虫病，在滨湖地区建立起生活生产安全圈。（附图片）
