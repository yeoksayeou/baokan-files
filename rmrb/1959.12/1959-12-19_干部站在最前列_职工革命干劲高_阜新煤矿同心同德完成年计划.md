Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th: The Fuxin Mining Bureau, one of China's largest coal industrial bases, has completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round and overfulfilled manner. As of the 15th of this month, raw coal production exceeded the annual plan by 470,000 tons, an increase of 29.1% compared with the actual output of the entire year last year; the raw coal full-staff efficiency increased by 6% compared with the plan; the raw coal ash content decreased by 2.7%; the cost decreased by 5.1% compared with the plan; the pit timber consumption decreased by 10% compared with the plan, and the profits turned over to the state completed the annual plan ahead of schedule by 6%.

    Party organizations at all levels in Fuxin City have adhered to and developed the experience of leading cadres participating in production and leading production. Leading cadres at all levels stand at the forefront of the mass movement, leading the masses to continuously leap forward, which has played a huge role in promoting the Fuxin Mining Bureau to complete the annual plan in a faster, better, and more economical way. Leading cadres of the Municipal Party Committee, the Mining Bureau, and various mines and workshops are often stationed on the front line of production. Wherever a new idea emerges, they appear there; wherever a weak link appears, they lead the cadres to rush there. In February of this year, Hou Kuiyuan, secretary of the Party Committee of the Xingu Ping'an Mine, used the "three-combination" method in the experimental field of the first coal mining area of the fifth pit to successfully create an advanced technology of "dry mining and hydraulic transportation," implementing drilling and blasting to drop coal, and low-pressure hydraulic loading and transportation, which eliminated the work method of using coal trucks for coal transportation. When this new thing first appeared, it was inevitable that there would be some shortcomings, and a few people with right-leaning sentiments came out to nitpick in every possible way, making it impossible to improve and promote it. After Qiu Xinye, first secretary of the Fuxin Municipal Party Committee, participated in labor in the mining area and discovered this situation, he immediately organized workers to hold a forum to solve a series of technical and management problems. Therefore, the new technology of "dry mining and hydraulic transportation" was quickly and universally promoted throughout the mine.

    In August of this year, the Fuxin Mine encountered an unusually heavy rainstorm that had not been seen in ten years, with continuous rain for fourteen days and a rainfall of 280 millimeters. More than half of the mine's coal production task relies on open-pit mines. The result of continuous rainstorms left the open-pit mines almost at a standstill. At this time, some people developed right-leaning thoughts, saying that "production difficulties are heavy, and the task for August cannot be completed." At this time, the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to all mine workers to fight the flood. Leading cadres such as the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee led working groups to go deep into the coal mining areas in the rain to inspect flood control and drainage projects. More than 400 leading cadres of the Haizhou Open-pit Mine moved their luggage to the site one after another, participated in labor shifts, and worked with the workers to drain water, seize coal, and mine coal in the rain. As a result, they not only made up for the underproduction caused by the rain, but also overfulfilled the August coal production plan by more than 12,000 tons, increasing coal production by 100,000 tons compared with July.

    The fact that leading cadres often go deep into the production site has greatly inspired the political enthusiasm of grassroots cadres. Many mines and pits have established a system in which cadres participate in labor for one to two days a week. Cadres of the Xingu Mine bring axes, saws, pliers and other tools with them every time they go down to the pit, and work with the workers to deal with production problems anytime and anywhere. Office cadres also made guarantees to the workers: they will supply materials in a timely manner if materials are needed, and they will supply tools in a timely manner if tools are needed. The workers are even more enthusiastic, and their action slogan is: "Conscientiously abide by operating procedures and ensure the completion of coal production tasks." The natural conditions in the sixth coal mining area of the fourth pit of Xingu are poor, and it is a well-known low-yield area in the bureau. In August, pit leader Wang Shuchun brought axes and other tools to work with the workers, studied together, found the law of this coalfield, improved the support method, improved the top-releasing quality, and increased the daily output from 6,000 to 7,000 tons to more than 11,000 tons, turning what was once recognized as a low-yield area into a high-yield area.

    In production, various mines have grasped the centralized command and production scheduling work, grasping both coal mining and production preparation. At the same time, the entire mine this year also focused on large-scale, high-yield, and bumper harvests, vigorously promoted advanced experience, and carried out red flag competitions to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward. These have greatly promoted the high yield and bumper harvest of coal mining work surfaces. (Attached picture)

    干部站在最前列  职工革命干劲高
    阜新煤矿同心同德完成年计划
    据新华社沈阳18日电　我国最大的煤炭工业基地之一——阜新矿务局，提前全面超额完成了今年的国家计划。到本月15日止，已产的原煤比年度计划超额了四十七万吨，比去年全年实际产量提高29.1％；原煤全员效率比计划提高6％；原煤灰粉降低2.7％；成本比计划降低5.1％；坑木消耗比计划降低10％，上缴利润提前一个月超额6％完成全年计划。
    阜新市各级党组织坚持和发展了领导干部参加生产领导生产的经验，各级领导干部站在群众运动的最前列，带领群众不断跃进，对于促进阜新矿务局多快好省地完成年度计划起了巨大的作用。市委、矿务局，以及各矿、各车间的领导干部，经常工作的岗位是在生产第一线。哪里出现了新事物的苗头，他们就出现在哪里；哪里出现薄弱环节，他们就带领干部奔到哪里。今年2月，新丘平安矿党委书记侯奎元在五坑第一采煤区的试验田里，采用“三结合”的办法，创造成功一项“旱采水运”的先进技术，实行打眼放炮落煤，低压水力装运，取消了用运煤机装运煤的工作方法。这一新事物刚一出现，难免有些缺点，少数有右倾情绪的人就出来百般挑剔，使它无法提高和推广。阜新市委第一书记丘新野到矿区参加劳动发现这一情况之后，就立即组织工人开座谈会，解决了一系列的技术问题和管理问题。因此，使“旱采水运”新技术很快在全矿普遍推广。
    今年8月，阜新矿遇到了十年未有的特大暴雨，连续下雨十四天，降雨量达二百八十毫米。这个矿的产煤任务有一半以上依靠露天矿完成，连续暴雨的结果，使露天矿几乎处于停产的状态。这时，有些人便产生了“生产困难重重，8月份任务无法完成”的右倾思想。这时，中共阜新市委向全矿职工发出了同洪水搏斗的号召。市委书记等领导干部带着工作组冒雨深入采煤作业区，检查防洪排水工程。海州露天矿四百多名领导干部，先后把行李搬到现场，跟班参加劳动，同工人一道排水夺煤、冒雨采煤。结果，不但补上了雨患的欠产，而且还超额一万二千多吨完成了8月份产煤计划，比7月份增产煤炭十万吨。
    领导干部经常深入生产现场，大大鼓舞了基层干部的政治热情，许多矿、坑都建立了干部每周参加劳动一天到两天的制度。新丘矿的干部每天下坑下井都带了斧、锯、钳等工具，随时随地和工人一道处理生产中的问题。科室干部也向工人提出保证：要材料及时供应材料，要工具及时供应工具。工人们更是干劲冲天，他们的行动口号是：“认真遵守操作规程，保证完成产煤任务”。新丘四坑第六采煤区自然条件差，是全局著名的低产区。8月份坑长王树春带了斧子等工具和工人一道劳动，一道研究，摸到了这块煤田的规律，改进支架方法，提高放顶质量，日产量从六、七千吨提高到一万一千多吨，使一向被公认的低产区变成了高产区。
    在生产中，各矿抓紧了集中指挥和生产调度工作，既抓采煤又抓生产准备。同时全矿今年还以大面积高额丰产为中心，大力推广先进经验，开展了比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的红旗竞赛。这些都大大促进了采煤工作面的高额丰产。（附图片）
