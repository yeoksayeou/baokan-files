Great Changes in Chaya Mountain in One Year
　　Yu Shenjiang, Deputy Secretary of the Chaya Mountain People's Commune Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Suiping County, Henan Province

　　Here, a bumper harvest of grain was seized from a drought unseen in decades, with autumn grain production increasing by 60% compared to last year's autumn grain, total annual grain production increasing by 40% compared to last year, and unit yield more than doubling that of 1957 before the communization.

　　Here, there wasn't even a decent handicraft workshop in the past, but now there are thirty-four factories with more than 1,300 workers. The total industrial output value has increased more than fivefold compared to 1958.

　　Here, a tractor station has been established, taking a big step towards agricultural mechanization.

　　Here, the mountains are green and the waters clear, flowers and fruits fill the mountains, and cattle and sheep are plentiful. Diversified business income has increased by 1.2 times compared to 1958.

　　1959 is about to pass, and 1960 is coming. At this moment of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, we recall the past year with such excitement. Our Chaya Mountain People's Commune, like all brother communes across the country, has gained very rich experience and achieved tremendous achievements in this year.

　　The Chaya Mountain People's Commune was formed on April 20, 1958, by merging twenty-seven advanced cooperatives. It is one of the earliest people's communes established in Henan Province. As soon as our commune was established, like a horse freed from its reins, all aspects of production have developed vigorously. In particular, the commune has greatly enhanced its ability to resist natural disasters, changing the old concept that "man is a slave to nature" for thousands of years, and man has become the master of nature.

　　In the year since the establishment of the commune, we encountered floods last year, serious rust disease and wheat midges this summer, and a severe drought in the autumn that was unseen in recent decades. However, these serious disasters have been overcome by the magnificent power of the people's commune. In the seventy-plus days of fighting drought to ensure a bumper harvest, thanks to the large population and strength of the people's commune, which can unify the arrangement of labor and materials, and adopt the combat method of large-scale corps and large-scale cooperation, 28,000 laborers were mobilized every day, using all kinds of large and small water lifting tools to draw water and irrigate the land day and night. In more than seventy days, the 20 million cubic meters of water used for irrigation was equivalent to seven torrential rains in more than 100,000 mu of land. The commune members said proudly: "If the sky doesn't rain, we can make it rain; if the dragon doesn't make clouds, we will." After the drought resistance struggle, autumn crops not only did not reduce production due to the disaster, but also achieved a greater harvest than in 1958. The autumn grain output alone increased by 60% compared to last autumn, and this year's total output also increased by 40% compared to 1958. The average grain yield per unit area reached 617 jin, more than doubling that of 1957 before the communization, creating a miracle of a bumper harvest in a year of severe drought.

　　In the past year, not only has grain production leaped forward, but also commune-run industries and various diversified business productions have also achieved rapid development. Before the communization, there wasn't even a decent handicraft workshop within forty or fifty li around Chaya Mountain. This year, it has developed to thirty-four factories with 1,339 workers. These factories have modified and created more than 10,000 pieces of agricultural tools this year, which strongly supported agricultural production. This year, the total industrial output value reached 2 million yuan, an increase of more than five times compared to 1958. This year, the commune also established a tractor station, purchasing 19 large and small tractors, 4 harvesters, 1 thresher, and 2 trailers, accelerating the realization of mechanization. The Chaya Mountain area is very large. In the past year, we have achieved unprecedented great achievements in the work of building and developing the mountainous area. As soon as the commune was established, it drew out labor and established forestry professional teams, creating eighteen flower and fruit mountains such as apples, walnuts, and oil tea, grafting more than 3.4 million fruit trees of various kinds, an increase of nearly 200 times compared to before liberation. The commune also established a 20,000-mu horticultural farm to cultivate various fruit tree seedlings. The commune also used the natural pastures in the mountainous area to greatly develop animal husbandry. In the past, the desolate and rocky Red Rock Mountain established a livestock general farm, with ten branch farms under it, and has built 126 new-style livestock houses with green bricks and red tiles. The number of large livestock in the entire commune increased by 20.5% within one year, the livestock breeding rate reached 100%, and the survival rate reached more than 95%. While developing large livestock, the commune also established many 10,000-pig farms, 1,000-rabbit ditches, and 10,000-chicken mountains... This year, the income from diversified business operations reached 2 million yuan, an increase of 1.2 times compared to last year. The development of diversified business production, with the development of forestry and animal husbandry as the center, has brought about earth-shaking changes to the barren and desolate Chaya Mountain area in a short period of more than a year. It has become a happy socialist mountainous area with green mountains and clear waters, flowers all over the mountains, and herds of cattle and sheep everywhere.

　　Due to the rapid development of all aspects of production, the commune's income has greatly increased this year. The total public accumulation of the commune has reached 1.12 million yuan, an increase of five and a half times compared to 1957 before the communization. The living standards of the commune members have also been further improved compared to last year. All twenty-seven brigades in the commune have implemented the food supply system, and the average income of commune members has increased from more than 58 yuan in 1958 to 96.8 yuan. The purchasing power of commune members has also greatly increased. Among the more than 9,300 households in the commune, more than 7,400 households have regular deposits.

　　Although we have achieved such great achievements in 1959, we will never be arrogant. We will resolutely continue to exert our efforts under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and organize a more comprehensive and better leap forward upsurge in 1960.

　　Our commune still achieved great achievements in various tasks under the severe disaster attack in 1959, which shows that our potential is still great. The achievements of 1959 have laid the foundation for a more comprehensive leap forward in 1960. Our goals for 1960 are: the entire commune will complete twenty reservoirs, so that the irrigated area reaches 90% of the total cultivated land area, of which 70% is gravity irrigation. The total grain output will increase from 54.73 million jin in 1959 to 77.64 million jin, an increase of 42%. Industry will continue to expand existing factories, develop commodity production, and achieve an output value of 5 million yuan, an increase of one and a half times compared to this year; greatly develop forestry and animal husbandry; develop 120,000 pigs, achieving one pig per mu of land. Develop 30,000 sheep, and develop 800,000 chickens, ducks, and geese, and 100,000 rabbits. Our slogan is: "Take pig raising as the key, promote the prosperity of the six animals, and achieve a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry." The members of the Chaya Mountain People's Commune are bravely advancing towards the realization of this grand plan!

　　嵖岈山一年巨变
    中共河南省遂平县嵖岈山人民公社委员会副书记　于慎江
    这里，从几十年未遇的大旱中夺得了粮食的丰收，秋粮产量比去年秋粮增产60％，全年粮食总产量比去年增加40％，单位产量比公社化前的1957年提高一倍多。
    这里，过去没有一个像样的手工业工场，而今已有了三十四个工厂，工人一千三百多人。工业总产值比1958年增长五倍多。
    这里，已经建立了拖拉机站，向农业机械化迈出了一大步。
    这里，青山绿水，花果满山，牛羊成群。多种经营收入比1958年增加一点二倍。
    1959年即将过去，1960年就要来临了，在这送旧迎新的时刻，我们怀着多么激动的心情回顾着即将过去的一年。我们嵖岈山人民公社和全国各个兄弟公社一样，在这一年里获得了非常丰富的经验，取得了巨大的成绩。
    嵖岈山人民公社是1958年4月20日由二十七个高级社合并成的，是河南省建立最早的一个人民公社。我们的公社一成立，就如脱缰的骏马一样，各项生产都得到蓬勃的发展。特别是公社大大增强了抗御自然灾害的能力，改变了千万年来“人是大自然的奴隶”的陈旧观念，人成为大自然的主人了。
    公社建立一年多来，去年遇到涝灾，今年夏季小麦又发生了严重的锈病和吸浆虫，秋季又遭到了近几十年来所未有过的严重旱灾。但是，这些严重的灾害，都被人民公社的雄伟力量战胜了。在七十多天抗旱保丰收斗争中，由于人民公社人多力量大，能够统一安排劳力和物力，采取大兵团、大协作的作战方法，每天出动二万八千名劳力，利用各种大大小小提水工具，日夜不息地车水浇地，在七十多天里，灌溉用的二千多万方水，等于在十多万亩地里下了七场倾盆大雨。社员们自豪的说：“天不下雨咱能下，龙不行云俺行云。”经过抗旱斗争，秋作物不仅没有因灾减产，而且获得了比1958年更大的丰收。仅秋季粮食产量就比去年秋季增产60％，今年全年的总产量也比1958年增加40％，粮食单位面积产量平均达到六百一十七斤，比公社化前的1957年提高了一倍多，出现了大旱之年大丰收的奇迹。
    一年来，不仅粮食生产突飞猛进，社办工业以及各种多种经营生产都获得了飞跃的发展。公社化前，嵖岈山周围四、五十里，连一个像样的手工业工场都没有，今年已发展到三十四个工厂，拥有一千三百三十九个工人。这些工厂，一年来改制和创制一万多件农具，有力的支援了农业生产。今年工业总产值达到二百万元，比1958年增加五倍还多。今年公社还建立了拖拉机站，购买大、小拖拉机十九部、收割机四部、脱粒机一部、拖车两部，加速了机械化的实现。嵖岈山山区面积很大，一年来，我们在建设山区、开发山区的工作上，获得了前所未有的巨大的成绩。公社一建立，就抽出劳力，成立林业专业队，营造了苹果、核桃、油茶等十八个花果山，嫁接各种果树三百四十多万株，比解放前增加了将近二百倍。公社还建立了一个拥有二万亩的园艺场，培植各种果木苗。公社还利用山区天然的牧场，大量发展畜牧业，在过去荒无人烟，乱石垒垒的红石岩，建立了一个畜牧总场，下设十个分场，已盖起一百二十六间青砖红瓦的新式畜舍。全社大牲畜一年内便增长了20.5％，牲口繁殖率达到100％，成活率达到95％以上。在发展大牲畜的同时，公社还建立了许多万头猪场，千只兔沟、万只鸡山……。今年多种经营的收入就有二百万元，比去年增长了一点二倍。以发展林业和牧业为中心的多种经营生产的发展，在短短的一年多时间里，就使贫瘠荒凉的嵖岈山区来了一个翻天复地的变化。这里已经变成到处是青山绿水，花朵满山，牛羊成群的社会主义幸福的山区了。
    由于各方面生产的飞跃发展，今年公社收入大大增加。全社公共积累已达一百一十二万元，比公社化前的1957年增长了五倍半，社员生活也比去年进一步提高了，全社二十七个大队全部实行了伙食供给制，社员平均收入由1958年的五十八元多提高到九十六元八角，社员的购买力也大大增加，全社九千三百多户社员，就有七千四百多户社员有常年存款。
    1959年我们虽然取得了这样大的成就，但是我们决不骄傲，我们要坚决在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，继续鼓足干劲，在1960年组织更全面、更好的跃进高潮。
    我们公社在1959年这样严重的灾害袭击下，仍然获得了各项工作的巨大成就，这就说明我们的潜力还很大。1959年的成就，为1960年更全面的跃进奠定了基础。1960年我们的指标是：全社要完成二十个水库，使灌溉面积达到总耕地面积的90％，其中自流灌溉70％，粮食总产由1959年的五千四百七十三万斤，增长到七千七百六十四万斤，即增长42％。工业继续扩大现有工厂，发展商品性的生产，产值五百万元，比今年增加一倍半；大量发展林业和畜牧业；生猪发展十二万头，实现一亩地一头猪。羊发展三万只，鸡、鸭、鹅发展八十万只，兔发展十万只。我们的口号是：“以养猪为纲，六畜兴旺，农、林、牧全面跃进”。嵖岈山人民公社的社员正在为实现这一雄伟的计划而奋勇前进！
