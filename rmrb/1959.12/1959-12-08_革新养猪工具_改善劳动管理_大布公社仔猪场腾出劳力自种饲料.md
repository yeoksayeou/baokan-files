Dabu Commune Piglet Farm Frees Up Labor to Grow Feed

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Dabu Commune Piglet Breeding Farm in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, has significantly increased the work efficiency of its breeders and solved the problem of insufficient labor by vigorously carrying out the reform of feeding tools and improving labor management.

This commune's piglet breeding farm was established in the fields, based on the principle of raising pigs locally, accumulating fertilizer locally, and applying fertilizer locally. When the farm was built in October last year, it was equipped with eighty-five breeders and raised more than seven hundred pigs. By the spring of this year, the number of pigs on the farm had developed to more than two thousand, and sixty-five mu of feed land had been added. At this time, the breeders could not take care of planting the land and feeding the pigs at the same time, and could not take care of feeding the pigs and accumulating fertilizer at the same time. Under this situation, everyone used their brains to vigorously reform tools and improve labor management.

Based on the suggestions of the breeders, the farm added a feed grinder. Three people operating it can grind 1,500 jin of feed per day, which increases work efficiency seven times compared to using a stone mill; in transportation, ten small rubber-wheeled carts were added. Using these carts to transport soil to pad the pens and transport fertilizer outwards increases work efficiency by 1.5 times compared to small earth carts; in feed processing, the method of heating and fermenting feed was reformed, so that three people can do the work of fifteen people in the past, and a large amount of firewood can also be saved; in composting, water carrying was changed to drawing water to irrigate the pens for composting. The entire farm has six hundred pen pits. In the past, carrying water to compost required 1,200 dan of water per day, which required fifteen people to complete. Later, a hand-cranked waterwheel was installed at a nearby reservoir, and the water ditches were directly connected to each pen, so that only two people could complete the task every day; in feeding pigs, the pig herd was trained to gather when they heard a whistle and eat together, which saved feeding time. In addition, a multi-skilled movement was launched among all the staff on the farm. Through on-site visits, practical teaching and learning, everyone learned four kinds of techniques, and the original division of labor between the "four members" of breeders, epidemic prevention personnel, technicians, and mating personnel was changed to a combination of "four members," which saved labor.

While vigorously carrying out technical innovation, the entire farm also improved labor management and implemented a ten-fixed responsibility system of fixed personnel, fixed number of pigs, fixed feed land, fixed fertilizer accumulation, fixed fatness, fixed reproduction, and fixed work points. The labor efficiency of the breeders increased by about 30%.

After the farm adopted the above methods, it overcame the difficulty of insufficient labor and did not add a single breeder. Over the past year, the entire farm has bred more than 10,400 piglets, achieving strong piglets and fat mothers, and full survival. Furthermore, it has accumulated more than 22 million jin of pen manure, and the feed land has also been planted very well, yielding a large amount of melon feed and grain. In addition to the rough feed collected by the breeders, the entire farm has achieved self-sufficiency in feed.

### 革新养猪工具　改善劳动管理  大布公社仔猪场腾出劳力自种饲料

    革新养猪工具　改善劳动管理
    大布公社仔猪场腾出劳力自种饲料
    据新华社讯　山东寿张县大布公社仔猪繁殖场，大搞饲养工具改革和改善劳动管理，饲养员工作效率显著提高，劳力不足的困难迎刃而解。
    这个公社的仔猪繁殖场，是本着就地养猪、就地积肥和就地施肥的原则，在田里建立的。去年10月建场时，配备了八十五名饲养员，养猪七百多头。到今年春天全场生猪已发展到二千多头，又添了六十五亩饲料地。这时，饲养员顾了种地顾不了喂猪，顾了喂猪顾不了积肥，在这种情况下，人人动脑筋，大搞工具改革和改善劳动管理。
    根据饲养员的建议，场里增加了一部饲料粉碎机，三个人操作，每天粉碎饲料一千五百斤，比用石碾轧料提高工效七倍；在运输上，增加十辆小胶轮车，用这种车运土垫圈和往外运肥，比小土车提高工效一点五倍；在饲料加工方面，改革加温变糟方法，这样三人就能顶过去十五人的活，还能节省大量烧柴；在沤肥上，改担水为引水灌圈沤肥，全场六百个圈坑，过去担水沤肥，每天需水一千二百担，十五个人才能完成，后来在附近水库上安一个手摇水车，把水垅沟直通各圈，每天只用两个人便完成了任务；在喂猪上，训练猪群能够听哨音集合，一齐吃食，节约了喂食时间。另外，在全场工作人员中开展多面手运动。通过现场参观，实教实学，都学会四种技术，由原来饲养员、防疫员、技术员、配种员“四员”分工，变为“四员”结合，节约了劳力。
    全场在大搞技术革新的同时，还改进了劳动管理，推行了定人员、定猪数、定饲料地、定积肥、定膘肥、定繁殖、定工分等十定责任制，饲养员的劳动效率又提高了30％左右。
    这个场采取了上述办法以后，克服了劳力不足的困难，没有增加一个饲养员。一年来全场共繁殖仔猪一万零四百多头，达到仔壮母肥，全生全活。并且积了圈肥二千二百多万斤，饲料地也种的很好，收了大量瓜类饲料和粮食，再加上饲养员采集的粗饲料，全场达到了饲料自给。
