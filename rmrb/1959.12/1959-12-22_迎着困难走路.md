　　Walking Towards Difficulties
　　Shan Jiushan
    "Believe in the masses, believe in the Party, be bold in carrying out innovation, step forward when you see difficulties, yield when you see honors, learn from the advanced, and help the backward." These are the words of Ma Xueli, a famous innovation expert from the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant. These few words, every one shining, demonstrate the noble communist style of our country's working class. Especially that heroic spirit of "stepping forward when you see difficulties" sets an example for us to forge ahead bravely and strive for the top. The moment you see difficulties, immediately meet them head-on, step on them, and move forward. To achieve this, one naturally needs many ingenious strategies, but the key lies in great enthusiasm, in knowing the difficulty and advancing, and "stepping forward" the moment you see it!
    Heroes who "step forward when you see difficulties" can be seen everywhere in our country. Now the whole country is vigorously developing pig farming, taking pig raising as the key link, promoting the prosperity of the six domestic animals, and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. To achieve one pig per mu is not an easy task, but people "step forward when they see difficulties," and things that are not easy to accomplish have become a reality in many places.
    In Liumingfu Management Area of Wangqiansi Commune in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, the number of pigs increased more than twenty times in one year; 4,500 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu on 15,000 mu of land; the total grain output increased from 1.35 million jin last year to 2.56 million jin. More pigs, more fertilizer, and more grain have enabled this management area to begin to change its impoverished face. This achievement did not fall from the sky, but was created by people from difficulties. The Party organization of the Liumingfu Management Area was resourceful and decisive, leading the masses to overcome difficulties. If there were too few piglets, they mobilized the masses to invest and purchase them; if there were too few pens, they built them themselves; if there was a shortage of feed, they tried every means to find it. They held their heads high in the face of difficulties, without fear, and with the lofty ambitions of Marxism-Leninism, truly fearing neither heaven nor earth. They first strategically despise difficulties, and then take effective measures to overcome them, treating difficulties under their feet as stepping stones for progress. This is a heroic style of revolutionaries. Pig farmers should learn this style, and everyone should learn this style in doing anything else.
    Those who are timid and afraid of trouble do not have this heroic style. They sigh and shrink back when they see difficulties, full of worries, and retreat when they know it is difficult. They shout loudly that this is impossible and that cannot be done, it is really a thousand difficulties and ten thousand obstacles like Mount Tai pressing down, they cannot move forward even one step, and even feel like they cannot live anymore. These people lie on top of difficulties, not daring to think or move, afraid of being eaten by difficulties. Such people are not brave revolutionary fighters, but cowards as timid as mice, lazy people who want to enjoy the fruits of others' labor. If we were to follow the opinions of these cowards and lazy people to raise pigs, then, I am afraid that Wangqiansi Commune would not even have a pig hair to this day.
    Facing difficulties, advancing or retreating, demonstrates two completely different worldviews. Ma Xueli, as well as the members of Wangqiansi Commune, have great ambitions, full of drive, foresight, and walk towards difficulties, this is a Marxist worldview. With this worldview, there is confidence in the inevitable victory of the revolutionary cause, and there is the courage and method to overcome difficulties. They treat difficulties not by thinking about how to escape them, but by thinking about how to overcome them, so they can fully utilize various favorable objective conditions and fully mobilize subjective initiative, and the greatest difficulties can be easily solved. Seeing difficulties and legs becoming weak, not daring to move forward even one step, this is the worldview of cowards and lazy people. In their view, the objective world cannot be changed, God is the master, people are powerless, everything should remain as it is, so what is the point of giving play to subjective initiative? These people simply do not have a bit of the "backbone" of revolutionaries, their revolutionary ambitions are scared away by a little difficulty.
    Two worldviews, two attitudes towards difficulties, the results are naturally different: walking towards difficulties is victory, escaping difficulties is failure. This is the fundamental difference between heroes and cowards, and lazy people.

　　迎着困难走路
　　单久山
    “相信群众相信党，大搞革新有胆量，见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮。”这是武汉重型机床厂著名革新能手马学礼说的话。寥寥数语，字字闪光，表现了我国工人阶级高尚的共产主义风格。尤其是那种“见困难就上”的英雄气概，给我们树立了勇往直前、力争上游的榜样。一见困难当前，立刻就迎上前去，一脚把它踏在地上，大步向前。要做到这样，自然要有很多奇策妙计，但是关键在于很大的干劲，在于知难而进，一见就“上”！
    “见困难就上”的英雄，在我们国家里到处都可以看见。现在全国农村正在大养特养其猪，以养猪为纲、六畜兴旺，使农林牧全面发展。要做到一亩地一头猪，不是一件十分容易的事，但是人们“见困难就上”，不大容易办到的事情，在许多地方已经成为事实了。
    河北省吴桥县王谦寺公社的留名府管理区，一年之内，生猪增加二十多倍；一万五千亩土地每亩施肥四千五百斤；粮食总产量由去年的一百三十五万斤提高到二百五十六万斤。猪多、肥多、粮多，使这个管理区开始改变了贫困的面貌。这个成绩不是从天上掉下来的，而是人们从困难中创造出来的。留名府管理区的党组织多谋善断，领导群众大破困难关，猪仔少，就发动群众投资购买；圈棚少，就自己动手修建；饲料缺，就千方百计地寻找。他们在困难面前昂首挺胸，毫无惧色，有着马克思列宁主义的雄心壮志，真是天不怕，地不怕。他们首先在战略上藐视困难，然后又采取有效措施去战胜困难，把困难踏在脚下当作前进的阶梯。这是一种革命者的英雄风格。养猪的人们要学习这种风格，做其他任何事情也都要学习这种风格。
    那些胆小怕事的人，是没有这种英雄风格的。他们看见困难，就唉声叹气，畏缩不前，顾虑重重，知难而退。他们大喊大叫，这也不可能，那也办不到，真是千难万难像泰山压顶，一步也不能前进，甚至有点活不下去了。这些人躺在困难上面，想也不敢想，动也不敢动，生怕被困难吃掉他一根毫毛。这种人不是勇敢的革命战士，而是胆小如鼠的懦夫，是坐享其成的懒汉。如果按照这些懦夫和懒汉的意见去养猪，那么，恐怕王谦寺公社至今连一根猪毛也不会有。
    在困难面前，是进是退，表现了两种截然不同的世界观。马学礼也好，王谦寺公社的社员们也好，他们胸怀大志，干劲十足，高瞻远瞩，迎着困难走路，这是一种马克思主义的世界观。有了这种世界观，就有了对革命事业必胜的信心，就有了战胜困难的勇气和办法。他们对待困难，不是想着如何逃避它，而是想着如何战胜它，因此他们既能充分利用客观上的各种有利条件，又能充分发动主观能动性，天大的困难都能迎刃而解。看见困难两条腿就发软，一步也不敢前进，这是懦夫和懒汉的世界观。在他们看来，客观世界是不可能改变的，上帝是主宰，人们无能为力，一切都原封不动好了，还发挥什么主观能动性呢？这些人简直没有一点革命者的“骨气”，他们的革命雄心被一点困难吓到九霄云外去了。
    两种世界观，两种对待困难的态度，结果自然不同：迎着困难走路是胜利，逃避困难是失败。这是英雄和懦夫、懒汉的基本分歧。
