　　The Omnipotent Service Department

　　The Guojiatuo Trading Store in the Chongqing mining area has established an omnipotent service department. This service department offers general consignment sales, mail orders, and purchases of train and boat tickets on behalf of customers. It also arranges household chores, provides nursing care, picks up and drops off guests, escorts children to nurseries, gets meals, boils water, and handles wedding and funeral arrangements. There are more than 150 service items. As long as the workers need it, it is truly "available on demand" and "has everything you need." If you want to hold a wedding, you only need to pay a handling fee of three yuan in the omnipotent service department, and the auditorium, flowers, tables, chairs, tea, and reception work can all be prepared properly. Once, Zhang Wenying, a worker's family member, returned from visiting relatives in Shenyang with a lot of luggage. At this time, the factory was carrying out a high-production week, and her husband could not leave his post. So, he entrusted the omnipotent service department to pick her up at the Chaotianmen Wharf, dozens of miles away from the factory, relieving the workers of the difficulty of not being able to take care of housework. Such things happen a lot...

　　A Photo

　　On the wall of the omnipotent service department, there is a photo of a young female worker. Is it an introduction to an advanced producer? No. It is posted in the "Suggestions Column" with the note "A souvenir for dear Mom Guo."

　　When the young female worker Jiang Xueying had her first child, her husband was busy with production and could not take care of her very well. It was inconvenient to eat vegetables or buy anything. Guo Yuxiang, a female salesperson at the non-staple food store, after learning about this, took time out in the morning, noon, and evening to see her, bringing her fresh vegetables and pig trotters, and helping with household chores.

　　A month passed quickly. On November 14, the store forwarded a warm letter of thanks and a photo of Jiang Xueying as a souvenir to Guo Yuxiang.

　　My Good Elder Sister

　　"Master Yuan, how much did you save this month?" Zhao Yinglian, a salesperson in the candy department and a service member of the omnipotent service department, came to the old worker Yuan Jinbai's home to handle savings business.

　　"We only have enough for expenses every month, and we are still a little short at the end of the month," Yuan's wife said apologetically. Zhao Yinglian thought to herself: There are only three people in the Yuan family, why is money so tight?

　　It turned out that Master Yuan was busy with work, and his wife had arthritis, making it inconvenient to go out. The family's expenses also lacked planning. After obtaining the consent of Master Yuan and his wife, Zhao Yinglian helped them buy vegetables and deliver oil and salt.

　　On this day, after Zhao Yinglian settled the account, it only cost a little more than one yuan a week. After preparing the bill, she took time out during her lunch break to go to Master Yuan's home. Master Yuan's wife said with satisfaction: My good elder sister, with such careful calculations, life will be better.

　　Organizing Mass Self-Service

　　The omnipotent service department only has two full-time staff members. There are so many things that workers need to do. What should they do? They have adopted several forms to organize mass self-service to meet the requirements of different objects.

　　One is to organize mass family mutual aid groups, one is to set up village and section life service workers, and one is to organize single workers' service teams based on the characteristics of concentrated accommodation for single workers, to provide comprehensive services such as washing clothes, sewing, decocting medicine, and buying meals for single workers in the dormitory. In the past, single workers could go to the hospital for serious illnesses, but no one took care of minor illnesses. Now, with the single workers' service team, they have water when they need it, tea when they need it, someone to decoct medicine and make soup, and they can even get a haircut while lying in bed. In the single dormitories, there is also a "service communication box" for the omnipotent service department. As long as the requirements and required time are specified, the service department can handle it on time.

　　万能服务部
    重庆工矿区的郭家沱贸易商店成立了一个万能服务部。这个服务部有一般性的寄售、函购、代客买车船票等业务；也代理安排家务、护理病人、接送客人、接送入托儿童、拿菜饭、烧开水，以及代办红白喜事等等，服务项目多达一百五十多种，只要职工需要，真是“有求必应、应有尽有”。如果你要举办婚礼，在万能服务部里只要花上三元钱的手续费，礼堂、鲜花、桌椅、茶水和招待工作，都可以准备得妥妥贴贴。有一次，工人家属张文英从沈阳探亲回来，携带行李较多。这时，厂里正在开展高产周，爱人不能离开工作岗位，就委托万能服务部到离厂几十里的朝天门码头去接，解除了工人不能兼顾家务的困难。像这样的事，可多着哩……
    一张照片
    万能服务部的墙壁上，贴着一张青年女工的照片。是介绍先进生产者？不。它是贴在“意见栏”里，写明“送给亲爱的郭妈作纪念”。
    青年女工姜学英，第一次生孩子，爱人生产忙，不能照顾得很周到。想吃点菜，买点什么东西都不方便。副食品商店女营业员郭玉祥知道这件事以后，每天抽出早晨、中午、晚上的空隙去看她，给她带点新鲜菜、猪蹄花去，顺便帮助料理一下家务。
    一个月的时间很快过去了。11月14日，商店转给郭玉祥一封热情的感谢信和姜学英赠送留念的一张照片。
    我的好大姐
    “袁师傅，这个月储蓄多少？”糖果门市部营业员兼万能服务部服务员赵应连到老工人袁金白家里办理储蓄业务来了。
    “月月只够开销，到月底还差一点。”袁师傅的爱人抱歉地说。赵应连心里盘算：袁师傅家只有三口人，为啥钱这样紧呢？
    原来，袁师傅工作忙，爱人有关节炎，进出不方便，家里开支又缺乏计划。经商得袁师傅夫妇的同意，由赵应连帮他们买菜、送油盐。
    这天，赵应连一结账，一个星期才花一元多钱。开好账单以后，她就抽出午饭后空隙时间到袁师傅家里。袁师傅的爱人满意地说：我的好大姐，这样精打细算，日子就好过了。
    组织群众自我服务
    万能服务部只有两个专职人员，工人们需要办的事那么多，怎么办呢？他们就采取几种形式组织群众自我服务，满足不同对象的要求。
    一种是组织群众性家庭互助组，一种是设置村段生活服务员，一种是根据单身工人集中住宿的特点组织单身工人服务队，到宿舍为单身工人洗衣、缝纫、代熬药、买菜饭等，开展综合性服务工作。过去单身工人大病可进医院，小病却没人护理，现在有了单身工人服务队，要水有水，要茶有茶，有人煎药熬汤，躺在床上也可以理发。在单身宿舍里还设有万能服务部的“服务通讯箱”，只要写明要求和需要时间，服务部就可以按时办到。
