    Technical Innovation Campaign in the Changbai Mountain Forest Area
    Implementing the Policy of "Combining Foreign and Local Methods" to Accelerate Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization
    (Reported by this newspaper) The lumberjacks of the Changbai Mountain forest industry, by implementing the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" by combining foreign and local methods, and by launching a mass movement for technical innovation, have transformed forest production from manual labor to mechanization and semi-mechanization. They have also achieved continuous year-round operation, rapidly increasing the level of timber production.
    The Changbai Mountain forest area is rich in valuable tree species such as red pine, larch, ash, and Amur cork. However, in the early days after liberation, due to the weak forest industry base and rudimentary equipment, timber could not be fully utilized. At that time, the vast Changbai Mountain forest area had less than 500 kilometers of forest railway for transporting timber, and all other operations such as felling, skidding, bucking, and loading were heavy manual labor. As a result, production could only take place during the short winter season, and production capacity was very low. It took one to two hundred days, or even a year, to fell a tree on the mountain and transport it down to be made into timber. A lumberjack working hard for a day could only produce about 0.1 cubic meters of timber.
    Over the past few years, especially during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the forest industry enterprises in Changbai Mountain, by implementing the Party's policy of using both foreign and local methods and combining state investment with self-reliance, universally mobilized the masses to carry out a technical innovation movement, which rapidly changed the face of forest industry production. On the one hand, the forest industry departments vigorously strengthened mechanized production, built 1,000 kilometers of new forest railways and 280 kilometers of timber transportation roads, and equipped themselves with a large number of tractors, winches, cranes, various trucks, steam locomotives, internal combustion locomotives, light and heavy-duty flatcars, and various electric saws, power saws, and mobile power stations, greatly increasing the degree of mechanized production. At the same time, the Forest Industry Party Committee widely mobilized workers to launch a vigorous technical innovation movement, creating various new tools such as wooden rail flatcars, pulleys, wooden horses, aerial cableways for skidding, and timber flatcars for transportation, greatly improving production efficiency and promoting the more rapid development of mechanized production. For example, the employees of the Huangnihe Forest Industry Bureau have created 104 new tools combining local and foreign methods, such as the "wooden rail live axle timber transport vehicle" and the "double wheel axle timber transport vehicle," increasing the proportion of mechanized and semi-mechanized skidding operations in the bureau from 34.9% to 86.1%. At the Linjiang Forest Industry Bureau, mechanical operations account for more than 95% of all operations. With the addition of locally made tools combining local and foreign methods, such as hand-operated log loaders, automatic timber transport machines, and aerial cableways, purely manual labor has been almost completely replaced.
    With the development of mechanized production, timber production and labor productivity have increased rapidly, while production costs have dropped sharply. According to statistics, this year's timber production has increased nearly twofold compared to 1949; labor productivity has increased by 122% compared to 1949; and production costs have fallen to about 40%. Before the realization of mechanization, the Linjiang Forest Industry Bureau produced less than 400,000 cubic meters of timber annually, requiring more than 7,000 people to go up the mountain. A full time worker only produced 79 cubic meters per year, and the cost of one cubic meter of timber was more than 30 yuan. This year, with a 98.4% increase in production tasks compared to the past, only 3,400 people are needed to complete the production task, with an annual output of 229 cubic meters per worker, and the timber cost has dropped to about 10 yuan per cubic meter.
    At present, the employees of the various forest industry enterprises in Changbai Mountain are continuing to implement the policy of walking on two legs, striving to maximize the effectiveness of existing machinery while carrying out a technical innovation movement to create and promote various new tools combining local and foreign methods. The forest industry departments have recently held several meetings on new tool reforms for different processes, exchanging experiences and organizing visiting groups to advanced units for on-site observation and learning. They aim to achieve a greater increase in the proportion of mechanized operations next year.

    长白山林区大闹技术革新
    贯彻“洋土结合”方针加快机械化和半机械化
    本报讯　长白山森林工业的采伐者们由于贯彻了党的“洋土结合”两条腿走路的方针，大搞群众运动和技术革新，已经使森林生产由过去的手工业操作变为机械化和半机械化，并且做到了常年流水作业，使木材生产水平迅速提高。
    长白山林区蕴藏着丰富的红松、落叶松、水曲柳、黄波罗等珍贵树种。但是在解放初期，由于这里的森林工业基础薄弱，设备简陋，木材不能充分地被利用起来。那时，广阔的长白山林区只有不到五百公里的森林铁路运材，其他如采伐、集材、造材、装卸车等，全部是笨重的手工作业。因此历年来的生产都只能在短短的冬季里作业，生产能力很低，从山上伐倒树，运到山下造成材，需要一、二百天，有的甚至需一年。采伐工人紧张劳动了一天，只能生产约零点一立方米木材。
    过去几年来，特别是1958年大跃进这一年，长白山各森林工业企业由于贯彻了党的洋法土法并举和国家投资建设与自力更生相结合的方针，普遍发动群众进行技术革新运动，使森林工业生产面貌迅速改观。一方面，各森林工业部门大力加强机械化生产建设，新建了一千公里的森林铁路和二百八十公里的运材公路；并且配置了大批拖拉机、绞盘机、起重机、各种载重汽车、蒸汽机车、内燃机车、轻重型台车和各种电锯、油锯、移动电站等等，大大增加了机械化生产程度。同时，森林工业党委又广泛发动职工开展轰轰烈烈的技术革新运动，创造了集材的木轨平车、滑车、木马、架空索道以及运材的木材台车等各种新工具，使生产效率大为提高，也促使机械化生产更迅速发展。如黄泥河森工局职工几年来就创造了“木轨活轮轴承运材车”、“双轮轴承运材车”等一百零四种土洋结合的新工具，使全局集材作业机械化和半机械化比重由34.9％提高到86.1％。临江森工局机械作业达到全部作业的95％以上，加上工人自己创造的手摇归楞机、自动运材机和架空索道等土洋结合的工具，纯手工业劳动几乎已全部被代替。
    随着机械化生产的发展，木材产量和劳动生产效率都迅速提高，生产成本则急剧下降。据统计，今年木材产量较1949年要增加近二倍；劳动生产率比1949年提高122％；生产成本则下降到40％左右。临江森工局在没有实现机械化以前，每年生产木材不到四十万立方米，就需要七千多人马上山，一个固定工人一年只生产七十九立方米，一立方米木材的成本费需要三十多元。而今年生产任务比过去增长了98.4％，只需要三千四百人就完成生产任务，一个工人年产量达二百二十九立方米，木材成本每立方米下降到十元左右。
    现在，长白山各森林工业企业职工正继续贯彻两条腿走路的方针，一面大力发挥现有机械的效能，一面开展技术革新运动，创造和推广各种土洋结合的新工具。森林工业部门最近连续召开了几次不同工序的新工具改革会议，交流经验，并且组织参观团到先进单位进行现场观摩学习。他们要力争明年机械化作业比重有更大的增加。
