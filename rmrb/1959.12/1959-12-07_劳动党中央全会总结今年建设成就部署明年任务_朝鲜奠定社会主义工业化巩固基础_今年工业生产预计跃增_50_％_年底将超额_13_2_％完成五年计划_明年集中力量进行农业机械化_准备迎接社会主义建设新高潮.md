Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th. The "Labor News" of North Korea published today the communique of the enlarged plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Korean Labor Party, saying that the meeting held from December 1st to 4th discussed the following issues: 1. On the 1960 annual plan for the development of the national economy; 2. On improving and strengthening the work of local political power organs; 3. On launching a mass campaign to plant economic forests. Rim Kye-chol, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of North Korea, Kim Il, member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Korean Labor Party and First Vice-Premier of the Cabinet, and Kim Man-keum, Minister of Agriculture, respectively made reports on the above three issues. The meeting discussed the above issues. At the meeting on the fourth day, Comrade Kim Il-sung made an important speech. The meeting passed relevant resolutions.

The communique said that when the plenary session discussed the 1960 annual plan for the development of the national economy, it first summarized the great achievements made by the Korean people in implementing this year's plan for the development of the national economy. The industrial production of North Korea, which has been developing at a high speed of 42% annual growth in total output value during the five years after the war, is expected to increase by 50% this year compared with last year, and the first five-year plan will be completed 13.2% above target by the end of this year.

The communique said that North Korean industry has completely eliminated the deformed nature of the colonial economy and laid a solid foundation for socialist industrialization. At the same time, North Korea has further consolidated its heavy industry base, especially the rapid development of the machinery manufacturing industry. North Korean industry has been able to build various modern production equipment on its own, manufacture heavy machinery on its own, and has the material and technical foundation for mass production of heavy machinery. The communique said: The movement to produce machine tools with machine tools, which has been launched in all factories and enterprises, has played a huge role in the epoch-making development of the machinery manufacturing industry and the promotion of the technical transformation of the people's economy.

The communique said that on the basis of the development of heavy industry, the production of mass consumer goods has increased rapidly. The development of local industries has mobilized new and huge potential to increase the production of mass consumer goods, and further promoted the development of the country's entire productive forces.

The communique said that great changes have also taken place in agriculture. The fundamental work of the agricultural technical revolution—water conservancy—has been basically completed. The electrification of rural areas has made great progress and created the economic and technical conditions for promoting mechanization. Due to the establishment of irrigation systems and the widespread adoption of intensive farming methods and various advanced agricultural techniques, the grain yield per unit area this year is expected to increase by 17.6% compared with last year.

The communique said: This year's monetary wages of employees have increased by 44% compared with last year, and actual wages have exceeded the level of 1961 stipulated in the first five-year plan. The actual income of farmers has also further increased.

The communique said that the plenary session unanimously pointed out that the great achievements made in the implementation of this year's plan for the development of the national economy proved the correctness and great vitality of the Korean Labor Party's economic policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while developing light industry and agriculture. This great achievement is also the result of the unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm of the Korean working people under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Korean Labor Party, giving full play to the spirit of Chollima.

The communique said that the plenary session, based on an analysis of the current economic situation in North Korea, stipulated the basic guidelines and central tasks for the development of the national economy in 1960.

The communique announced that North Korea will begin implementing the new second five-year plan from 1961, and the second five-year plan period will be a decisive period for socialist construction in North Korea. The plenary session unanimously agreed that, according to the proposal of Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Party's policy of setting 1960 as a buffer period in North Korea's economic development in order to make all preparations for occupying new heights in socialist construction is correct.

The resolution of the plenary session pointed out that the central task of the buffer period is: "To alleviate the tensions caused in some economic sectors in the implementation of the plans of the past period, especially this year, to strengthen weak links, and to further improve the people's living standards."

The plenary session proposed that the primary task for 1960 is to concentrate efforts on agricultural mechanization. The communique said that the plenary session proposed the task of mobilizing all equipment and capabilities of North Korea's machinery industry to produce and supply modern agricultural machinery and tools in large quantities to promote agricultural mechanization.

The communique said that the Korean Labor Party's policy on agricultural mechanization is: to promote mechanization by providing tractors, trucks, and other modern power machinery in conjunction with the supply of animal-powered agricultural machinery; to gradually expand from the plains to the mountainous areas. At the same time, the plenary session decided that in order to improve the role of modern agricultural machinery rental stations in agricultural mechanization, these agricultural machinery rental stations should be reorganized into agricultural machinery work stations, so that they can fully assume the responsibility for agricultural production in the division of labor area.

The plenary session proposed that vigorously improving the people's living standards should be regarded as an important task in 1960. Next year, we must do everything possible to increase the production of grain, non-staple food, and mass consumer goods, further expand their variety, increase output and quality, and satisfactorily supply the various consumer goods required by the people. At the same time, we must vigorously build residential houses and cultural welfare facilities for the working people.

The important task proposed by the plenary session for 1960 is: to carry out less new construction in the industrial production sector, and to rely on improving labor productivity and the utilization rate of existing production equipment and production areas to ensure the growth of production.

According to the important tasks for 1960, the plenary session decided on the tasks of various departments: in the industrial sector, continue to adhere to the basic line of the Korean Labor Party in economic construction, and concentrate greater efforts on agricultural machinery manufacturing, mining, fisheries, and chemical fiber industries. The plenary session decided that North Korea's total industrial output value in 1960 will increase by 12.5% compared with 1959, of which the production of means of production will increase by 15.1% and the production of consumer goods will increase by 9.6%.

The communique said that the production of agricultural machinery in 1960 will increase by 256% compared with this year, and mining will increase by 31.4%.

The plenary session stipulated that the light industry sector should produce a variety of fabrics, increase the proportion of various knitwear and high-grade textiles, and increase the production of non-staple foods. Local industries should supply 54% of mass consumer goods next year.

In terms of agriculture, the plenary session stipulated that we must do everything possible to increase grain production, expand vegetable production, promote the development of animal husbandry, and further develop the production of oils, cash crops, fruit trees, and sericulture. The plenary session particularly emphasized that in the livestock sector, the public livestock breeding of agricultural cooperatives should be the main focus, supplemented by the private sideline businesses of cooperative members, so that the livestock industry can be actively developed and a fundamental transformation can occur in the production of livestock products. The communique emphasized that we should comprehensively launch a campaign for agricultural cooperatives to have one to two pigs per jeongbo (15 mu) of cultivated land and for cooperative members to raise two pigs per household within one and a half years, and we should also vigorously raise rabbits. The communique also emphasized that land should be utilized to the maximum extent.

Regarding the second item on the agenda of the meeting—improving and strengthening the work of local political power organs, the communique said that the current new conditions in North Korea are: socialist relations of production in urban and rural areas have become a single relation of production, local industries are developing rapidly, and many powers to lead various sectors of the people's economy have been taken over by local authorities. This has expanded the workload and scope of local political power organs, thereby requiring local political power to actively improve their working methods to adapt to the changed conditions.

The communique said that the plenary session pointed out that in order to improve and strengthen the work of local political power organs, it is first necessary to improve the level of planning work and to conduct production, accumulation, distribution, and consumption in a planned manner. To this end, it is first necessary to strengthen the planning committees of local political power organs at all levels. At the same time, it is important to establish a working system for compiling national economic plans and to implement the mass line.

The communique said that the plenary session pointed out that in order to improve and strengthen the work of local political power organs, it is important to improve administrative organizational work. The plenary session emphasized that all work should make political work the priority, so that lower-level personnel and the masses can clearly understand the essence of the Party's policies and consciously mobilize to implement the Party's policies.

When discussing the third item on the agenda—on launching a mass campaign to plant economic forests, the plenary session pointed out that it is necessary to actively utilize mountain and forest resources to develop North Korea's economy and improve the people's living standards more rapidly. The plenary session decided to plant 500,000 jeongbo of economic forests in the next five or six years, and stipulated the specific tasks for planting economic forests. The communique announced that in order to effectively implement this huge task, tree planting weeks will be held every spring and autumn. The plenary session called on all the people to participate in the voluntary labor of planting economic forests during the tree planting week.

The communique said that the plenary session also discussed issues of great significance to promoting socialist construction in North Korea and put forward important tasks.

The communique said that Comrade Kim Il-sung emphasized at the meeting that the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Korean Labor Party in December 1956 was held when the first five-year plan was beginning to be implemented. That plenary session called on all the people to launch an increase production and practice economy movement, which set off the historically significant great revolutionary upsurge of the Chollima movement. This plenary session is facing the second five-year plan and must effectively implement the tasks of the buffer period next year. This meeting will become a historically significant meeting to prepare for launching a new upsurge in socialist construction and to encourage all the working people to struggle.

    劳动党中央全会总结今年建设成就部署明年任务
    朝鲜奠定社会主义工业化巩固基础
    今年工业生产预计跃增50％　年底将超额13.2％完成五年计划
    明年集中力量进行农业机械化　准备迎接社会主义建设新高潮
    新华社平壤6日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会扩大全体会议的公报说，从12月1日到4日举行的这次会议讨论了下列问题：一、关于1960年度的人民经济发展计划；二、关于改进和加强地方政权机关的工作；三、关于开展全民植造经济林的运动。朝鲜国家计划委员会委员长林桂哲，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会常务委员会委员、内阁第一副首相金一和农业相金万金分别就上述三个问题作了报告。会议就上述问题进行了讨论。在第四天的会议上，金日成同志作了重要发言。会议通过了有关决议。
    公报说，全会在讨论1960年度人民经济发展计划的时候，首先总结了朝鲜人民在执行今年的人民经济发展计划过程中取得的巨大成就。在战后五年中平均每年以增长总产值42％的高速度发展着的朝鲜工业生产，预计今年将比去年跃增50％，到今年年底将超额13.2％完成第一个五年计划。
    公报说，朝鲜工业已经完全消除了殖民地经济的畸形性质，打下了牢固的社会主义工业化的基础。同时，朝鲜进一步巩固了重工业基地，特别是迅速发展了机械制造工业。朝鲜工业已经能够自己建设各种现代化生产设备，能够自己制造重型机械，并且具备了大量生产重型机械的物质和技术基础。公报说：在所有的工厂、企业中展开的机床生产机床的运动，对于划时代的发展机械制造工业和促进人民经济发展的技术改造起了巨大的作用。
    公报说，在重工业发展的基础上，群众消费品的生产有了迅速的增加。地方工业的发展动员了能使群众消费品生产增长的新的巨大潜力，并且进一步促进了国家的整个生产力的发展。
    公报说，在农业方面也发生了巨大的变化。进行农业技术革命的根本工作——水利化，已经基本上完成了。农村的电气化有了巨大的发展，并且创造了促进机械化的经济技术条件。由于建立了灌溉系统，广泛采用了集约耕作法和各种先进农业技术，预计今年的粮食单位面积产量将比去年提高17.6％。
    公报说：今年的职工货币工资比去年增长了44％，实际工资已经超过第一个五年计划规定的1961年的水平。农民的实际收入也进一步增加了。
    公报说，全会一致指出，在执行今年人民经济发展计划中取得的巨大成就，证明了朝鲜劳动党的优先发展重工业，同时发展轻工业和农业的经济政策的正确性和它的巨大的生命力。这种巨大成就也是朝鲜劳动人民在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会的英明领导下，以千里马的气势发挥空前革命干劲的结果。
    公报说，全会在分析了目前朝鲜的经济情况的基础上规定了1960年人民经济发展的基本方针和中心任务。
    公报宣布，朝鲜将从1961年开始执行新的第二个五年计划，第二个五年计划期间将成为朝鲜社会主义建设的决定性时期。全会一致认为，根据金日成同志的倡议，为了在社会主义建设中占领新的高地作好一切准备，把1960年定为朝鲜经济发展中的缓冲期的党的方针是正确。
    全会的决议指出，缓冲期的中心任务是：“缓和在执行过去时期、特别是今年的计划中，在一部分经济部门中造成的紧张性，加强薄弱环节，进一步提高人民生活。”
    全会提出，1960年的首要任务是集中力量进行农业机械化。公报说，全会提出了动员朝鲜机械工业的一切设备和能力，大量生产、供应现代化的农业机械和农具，来促进农业机械化的任务。
    公报说，朝鲜劳动党关于农业机械化的方针是：同供应畜力农业机械并举，通过提供拖拉机、载重汽车等现代化动力机械促进机械化；由平原地区开始逐渐扩展到山区。全会同时决定，为了提高现代化的农业机械代耕站在农业机械化中的作用，把这些农业机械代耕站改组为农业机械作业所，使它们完全担负起分工地区内的农业生产的责任。
    全会提出，要把大力提高人民生活当作1960年的重要任务。明年要千方百计地增加粮食和副食品以及群众消费品的生产，进一步扩大它们的品种，提高产量和质量，圆满地供应人民要求的各种消费品。同时要大力建设劳动人民住宅和文化福利设施。
    全会提出的1960年的重要任务是：在工业生产部门少进行新的建设，要依靠提高劳动生产率和现有的生产设备、生产面积的利用率来保证生产的增长。
    根据1960年的重要任务，全会决定了各部门的任务：在工业部门继续坚持朝鲜劳动党在经济建设方面的基本路线，集中更大的力量于农业机械制造、矿业、水产业、化学纤维工业部门。全会决定朝鲜在1960年的工业总产值比1959年增长12.5％，其中生产资料的生产增长15.1％，消费品的生产增长9.6％。
    公报说，1960年农业机械的生产将比今年增长256％，矿业增长31.4％。
    全会规定，轻工业部门要生产多种多样的布匹，提高各种针织品和高级纺织品的比重，增加副食品的生产。地方工业要供应明年群众消费品的54％。
    在农业方面，全会规定要千方百计地增加粮食生产，扩大蔬菜生产，促进畜产业的发展，进一步发展油脂、经济作物、果树业和蚕业的生产。全会特别强调，在畜产部门要以农业社的公养家畜为主，社员的私人副业为辅，使畜产业得到积极发展，使畜产品的生产发生根本的转变。公报强调，要全面展开农业社在一年半内达到每町步（合十五市亩）耕地有一口到两口猪、社员每家养两口猪的运动，还要大力养兔。公报还强调要最大限度地利用土地。
  关于会议的第二项议程——改进和加强地方政权机关的工作，公报说，朝鲜当前的新的条件是：城市和农村社会主义生产关系成为单一的生产关系，地方工业正在迅速发展，领导人民经济各部门的许多权限已经由地方接管，这样就扩大了地方政权机关的工作量和工作范围，从而要求地方政权适应已经变化了的条件能动地改进自己的工作方法。
    公报说，全会指出，为了改进和加强地方政权机关的工作，首先要提高计划工作的水平，有计划地进行生产、积累、分配和消费。为此，首先要加强各级地方政权机关的计划委员会。同时要建立编制人民经济计划的工作体系，重要的是贯彻群众路线。
    公报说，全会指出，为了改进和加强地方政权机关的工作，重要的是改善行政组织工作。全会强调一切工作要使政治工作先行，使下级人员和群众明确地认识党的政策的本质，自觉地动员起来执行党的政策。
    全会在讨论第三项议程——关于开展全民植造经济林运动时指出，要积极利用山林资源，以更加迅速地发展朝鲜的经济和改善人民的生活。全会决定要在最近五、六年内植造五十万町步的经济林，并且规定了植造经济林的具体任务。公报宣布，为了有成效地执行这一巨大任务，每年春秋两季举行植树周。全会号召全体人民在植树周中参加植造经济林的义务劳动。
    公报说，全会还讨论了对促进朝鲜的社会主义建设有重要意义的问题，提出了重要的任务。
    公报说，金日成同志在会议上曾经强调，1956年12月朝鲜劳动党中央全会是在开始执行第一个五年计划的时候举行的，那次全会号召全体人民展开增产节约运动，掀起了有历史意义的千里马运动的大革命高潮，这次全会面临着第二个五年计划，要有成效地执行明年的缓冲期的任务。这次会议成为为了替掀起新的社会主义建设高潮进行准备，鼓舞全体劳动人民进行斗争的有历史意义的会议。
