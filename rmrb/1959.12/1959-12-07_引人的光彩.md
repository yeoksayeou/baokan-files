The ideal of "man will conquer nature," which has been cherished by the broad masses of people for thousands of years, is gradually becoming a reality in the face of the heroic and hardworking 600 million people who have stood up. The great victory achieved by the broad masses of farmers this year in the struggle against severe natural disasters is the most vivid proof of this.

This year, our country suffered the most severe natural disasters since liberation. However, relying on the people's commune, a social organization with strong vitality, people used their strong will and actions to wage a resolute struggle against it, turning severe disasters into minor ones, and reducing production cuts to guaranteeing production; some places even won bumper harvests in the years of severe drought. PingShun County in Shanxi Province is one example. The county overcame a century of severe drought and multiple wind, hail, and insect disasters, achieving a bumper harvest of 400 jin per mu, an increase of 27% compared to 1958, realizing the agricultural development program's grain target eight years ahead of schedule.

Please take a look at the scene of the people of Pingshun, the hometown of labor hero Li Shunda, fighting against the drought. What a magnificent and earth-shattering scene of struggle, what a lofty communist style! This year, Pingshun County experienced a "strangling" drought, and the corn leaves were so dry that they could be lit with a match. In the face of such a serious disaster, people did not lose heart. The Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China made full use of the strength of the large collective of the commune to lead the masses to launch a drought resistance struggle of "protecting seedlings as if protecting lives." In the drought resistance struggle, the two communes of Shicheng and Beidan collaborated, concentrating labor and waterwheels to divert the Zhanghe River water to the high mountains, irrigating more than 10,000 mu of dry land. The Doukou Management Area of Shicheng Commune also used the method of rope-suspended pipes to transport water in the air, diverting water from the South Mountain to the North Mountain to irrigate fields. After the all-out round-the-clock efforts of the county's 50,000-strong drought resistance army, making full use of all machinery and water sources, crops throughout the county that were affected by the drought were generally watered or furrow-irrigated once during the severe drought. While resisting drought and protecting seedlings, the people's communes in Pingshun County also launched a "million-channel" movement, building flood diversion canals everywhere and flood diversion ditches on every plot, so this year they greatly benefited from the floods: fully utilizing rainwater to irrigate 150,000 mu of cultivated land, so that crops basically got rid of the threat of drought.

"Strong grass is known in a gale, and a horse's strength is known on a long journey." Seventy days of drought tested the power of the people's commune to turn the tide. An anti-drought force of tens of thousands of people could not have been organized without the "large-scale and public" organization of the people's commune; distant water sources could not have flowed to nearby fields without the unified planning and overall arrangement of the commune; without the people's commune running a large number of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, it would not have been possible to put thousands of women into the anti-drought battle, and the labor problem of the anti-drought struggle could not have been solved. These are all powerful manifestations of the strong vitality and incomparable superiority of the people's commune.

Now, as we celebrate PingShun County's bumper harvest in the year of severe drought, let us pay tribute to the broad masses of commune members who have worked hard to overcome disasters, and let us cheer the people's commune, which has shown the power to turn the tide in drought resistance!

    千百年来广大人民的“人定胜天”的理想，在站立起来了的英勇勤劳的六亿人民面前正在逐渐变为现实。今年广大农民在同严重的自然灾害斗争中取得的伟大胜利，就是一个最生动的证明。
    今年我国遭受了解放以来最严重的自然灾害的侵袭。但是人们依靠人民公社这个具有强大生命力的社会组织，用坚强的意志和行动，同它进行了坚决的斗争，使重灾化轻灾，变减产为保产；有的地方甚至在大旱之年赢得了大丰收。山西平顺县就是其中的一例，这个县战胜了百年大旱和多次风、雹、虫灾，获得了亩产四百斤的大丰收，比1958年增产27％，提前八年实现了农业发展纲要粮食指标。
    请看看劳动英雄李顺达的家乡——平顺人民和旱灾作斗争的情景，这是多么惊天动地的斗争场面，多么崇高的共产主义风格！平顺县今年发生了“卡脖子”旱，玉米叶子干枯得可以用火柴点燃。在这样严重的灾害面前，人们没有泄气。中共平顺县委充分利用公社大集体的力量，领导群众展开了“保苗如保命”的抗旱斗争。在抗旱斗争中，石城和北耽车两个公社协同作战，集中劳力、水车，把漳河水引到高山，使一万多亩旱田得到了灌溉。石城公社竇口管理区还用绳索吊管的办法，空中运水，把南山的水调到北山灌田。经过全县五万抗旱大军昼夜突击，充分利用一切机具、水源，使全县受旱作物在大旱之际普遍点浇或沟灌一次。在抗旱保苗的同时，平顺县各人民公社又掀起了“百万条水渠”运动，作到了地地修引洪渠、块块有引洪沟，因此，今年大大收到了洪水之利：充分利用雨水浇灌了十五万亩耕地，使作物基本摆脱了干旱的威胁。
    “疾风知劲草，路遥知马力。”七十多天的干旱，检验了人民公社的回天威力。几万人的抗旱队伍，没有人民公社这样“一大二公”的组织是不可能组织起来的；远处水源，没有公社的统一规划、全面安排是流不到近田里来的；没有人民公社举办大量的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，就不能使成千上万的妇女投入抗旱战斗，抗旱斗争的劳力问题是解决不了的。这些都是人民公社强大生命力和无比优越性的有力表现。
    现在，在喜庆平顺县在大旱之年获得大丰收的时候，让我们向奋力战胜灾害的广大社员致敬，向在抗旱中显示了回天之力的人民公社欢呼！
