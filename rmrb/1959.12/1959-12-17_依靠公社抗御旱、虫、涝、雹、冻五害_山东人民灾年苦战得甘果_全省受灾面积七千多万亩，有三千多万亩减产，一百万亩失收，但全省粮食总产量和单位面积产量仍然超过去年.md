Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 16th: Under the correct leadership of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the people of Shandong Province have this year, with unparalleled heroic spirit, overcome various serious natural disasters and achieved a great agricultural harvest. Although the province suffered various disasters across an area of over 77.7 million mu, with over 34 million mu experiencing a production decrease of more than 20% due to the disasters, and one million mu suffering crop failure, the province's average yield per unit area and total output of grain still greatly increased compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

Since the beginning of spring this year, Shandong Province has successively suffered from natural disasters such as drought, insects, floods, and frost. From mid-June to early August, 74 counties and cities in areas including Liaocheng, Heze, Jining, Zibo, and Linyi experienced drought, affecting an area of 73.3 million mu, accounting for 58% of the total cultivated land. The drought in some counties in the Jining, Liaocheng, and Heze areas lasted for more than 100 days. According to historical records, the duration of the drought in the province this year was unprecedented in the past 30 years. At the same time, the situation of crop diseases and insect pests this year was also serious, with locusts, corn borers, and armyworms occurring in many areas. From April to October, 53 counties and cities including Wenshang, Feicheng, Qihe, Cangshan, Junan, Yexian, Penglai, and Shouguang also experienced 16 hailstorms, affecting an area of over 2.9 million mu. In addition, more than one million mu of farmland suffered from floods and frost damage.

In the face of severe natural disasters, the heroic people of Shandong Province, under the leadership of the Party, launched a tenacious struggle, overcame various disasters, and transformed a year of disaster into a year of bumper harvest. When signs of drought first appeared, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately issued urgent instructions, convened various meetings, and called on the vast number of cadres and masses throughout the province to mobilize and overcome the drought. Party committees at all levels established drought prevention and control headquarters and adopted various effective measures to lead the fight against drought. As the drought continued and expanded, the Provincial Party Committee constantly pointed out to the people the favorable conditions for "fighting the drought demon and skillfully seizing a bumper harvest," strengthening the confidence of the people of the province in overcoming the drought. At the same time, from the Provincial Party Secretary to the prefectural, county, and commune Party secretaries, all personally went to the front lines of the drought resistance effort to strengthen leadership. During this period, hundreds of thousands of cadres throughout the province camped in the fields and worked alongside the masses to fight the drought, solving problems immediately. In the fight against drought, the vast number of cadres and masses exhausted the water stored in rivers, ponds, and reservoirs, and then crossed mountains and ridges to find water sources, digging mountain springs, intercepting rivers, and diverting water up the mountains, and using artificial water carrying and animal transport methods to irrigate the land. Through this period of drought resistance, more than 30 million mu of early autumn crops throughout the province achieved a bumper harvest. After the beginning of August, although the drought situation became more severe, the people of the province, inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, quickly launched a new upsurge in the massive drought resistance movement, universally applying fertilizer and water, cultivating soil, and weeding and killing insects to drought-affected crops. In the work of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, all counties and people's communes implemented a combination of professional teams and mass assaults, and a combination of chemical pesticides and local pesticides. Moreover, there was joint prevention among teams, communes, and counties, working in coordination to promptly eliminate various insect pests.

The people's communes in various places have demonstrated tremendous power in fighting against natural disasters. During the drought resistance struggle, the people's communes in Shou Zhang County on the Luxi Plain organized a large corps of 230,000 people to operate, excavating and renovating more than 11,000 canals, expanding the irrigated area by 800,000 mu, and overcoming a drought that lasted more than 100 days, resulting in an average yield per mu of grain crops that was 40% higher than last year. In Chenji Commune in Chengwu County, 55 villages starved to death 970 people during the great drought of 1942, and more than 8,000 people fled to other places to beg for food. Although the drought in this area this year was much more serious than in 1942, the people, relying on the power of the commune, subdued the "drought demon," transformed dry land into paddy fields, and achieved a great harvest of more than 20,000 mu of early-maturing crops in the commune. Among them, millet production increased by 100% compared to last year, and sorghum and corn production increased by 20% to 30%.

In the fight against drought, the industrial, transportation, and commercial departments in various places actively produced and allocated a large amount of materials to support the countryside. Cadres, workers, teachers and students of schools, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and urban residents also enthusiastically helped the people's communes to rush irrigation. During the most intense period of drought resistance, hundreds of thousands of cadres, workers, students, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and urban residents throughout the province supported the drought resistance effort every day. The province also organized more than 80,000 county and commune blacksmiths and carpenters to go to the fields with their tools to inspect and repair tools, powerfully supporting the drought resistance struggle.

After several months of hard work, the people of the province not only turned a lean year into a bumper year, but also built more than 74,000 canals, more than 60 ponds and reservoirs, more than 230,000 wells, and a large number of other water diversion projects, expanding the irrigated area by more than 3.5 million mu and improving the irrigation area by more than 2.5 million mu. County and commune industries produced more than 1,000 sets of drainage and irrigation machinery, 35,000 waterwheels, and more than 130,000 pieces of simple water lifting tools. These water conservancy projects and drainage and irrigation machinery not only played a major role in the fight against drought, but also have a significant impact on improving farmland irrigation in the future. Now, after achieving a bumper harvest after overcoming the disaster, the people of the province are actively launching winter production activities centered on water conservancy construction.

    依靠公社抗御旱、虫、涝、雹、冻五害
    山东人民灾年苦战得甘果
    全省受灾面积七千多万亩，有三千多万亩减产，一百万亩失收，但全省粮食总产量和单位面积产量仍然超过去年
    新华社济南16日电　高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，山东省人民今年在中共山东省委的正确领导下，以无比英雄气概，战胜了各种严重的自然灾害，获得了农业大丰收。全省遭受各种灾害的面积虽然有七千七百多万亩，其中有三千四百多万亩因灾减产两成多，有一百万亩因灾失收。但是，全省粮食的平均单位面积产量和总产量，仍然比大跃进的1958年有很大增长。
    山东省今年入春以来，相继遭受了旱、虫、涝、雹、冻等自然灾害的侵袭。从6月中旬到8月上旬，先后有聊城、菏泽、济宁、淄博、临沂等地区的七十四个县市发生干旱现象，受旱面积达七千三百多万亩，占耕地总面积的58％。济宁、聊城、菏泽地区部分县的旱象，持续一百多天。据历史资料记载，今年全省受旱时间之长是三十年来所未有的。同时，今年农作物遭受病虫害的情况也是严重的，许多地区都发生了蝗虫、玉米螟和造桥虫等病虫害；从4月到10月，汶上、肥城、齐河、苍山、莒南、掖县、蓬莱、寿光等五十三个县市还发生了十六次雹灾，面积达二百九十多万亩。另外，还有一百多万亩农田受到了涝灾和冻害。
    在严重的自然灾害面前，英雄的山东省人民，在党的领导下，展开了顽强的斗争，战胜了各种灾害，使灾年变成丰收年。当旱象刚露头的时候，中共山东省委就立即发出紧急指示，召开各种会议，号召全省广大干部和群众动员起来战胜干旱。各级党委都成立了防旱、抗旱指挥部，采取各项有效措施领导抗旱斗争。当旱象延续和扩大后，省委不断向人民指出了“大战旱魔，巧夺丰收”的有利条件，坚定了全省人民战胜干旱的信心。同时，从省委书记到地委、县委、公社党委书记，都亲临抗旱前线加强领导。在这一期间，全省有数十万名干部到田间安营扎寨，和群众一道抗旱，发现问题马上解决，在抗旱中，广大干部和群众用完了河、塘、水库的蓄水以后，就翻山越岭找水源，挖山泉，拦河截流，引水上山，并用人工挑水、牲口驮水的办法来浇地。经过这一时期的抗旱斗争，使全省三千多万亩早秋作物得到了丰收。8月上旬以后，虽然旱情更加严重，但全省人民在党的八届八中全会的精神鼓舞下，迅速掀起了声势浩大的抗旱运动新高潮，对受旱作物普遍加肥浇水、中耕培土和锄草灭虫。在防治病虫害的工作中，各县和人民公社都实行了专业队和群众突击相结合，化学农药和土农药相结合的方法，并且队队联防、社社联防、县县联防，协同作战，及时扑灭了各种虫害。
    各地人民公社在抗击自然灾害中发挥了巨大的威力。鲁西平原的寿张县各人民公社，在抗旱斗争期间组织了二十三万人的大兵团作战，开挖和整修渠道一万一千多条，扩大浇地面积八十万亩，战胜了持续一百多天的干旱，使全县粮食作物的平均亩产量比去年增长了40％。成武县陈集公社，在1942年大旱灾中，有五十五个村庄饿死了九百七十人，还有八千多人逃荒到外地乞食。今年这个地区的干旱虽然比1942年严重得多，但是人民群众依靠公社的力量，降服了“旱魔”，把旱田改成水田，使全社两万多亩早熟作物取得大丰收。其中，谷子比去年增产一倍，高粱和玉米增产二成到三成多。
    在抗旱中，各地工业、交通运输和商业部门，积极生产和调拨了大量物资支援农村。各地干部、工人、学校师生、解放军官兵和城市居民，也热烈帮助人民公社抢浇抢灌。在抗旱最紧张的时期，全省每天支援抗旱的干部、工人、学生、解放军官兵和城市居民达数十万人。全省还组织了八万多名县、社铁匠木工带着工具下田，巡回检修工具，有力地支援了抗旱斗争。
    全省人民经过几个月的艰苦奋战，不仅使歉年变丰年，还修建了七万四千多条渠道，六十多座塘坝和蓄水池，二十三万多眼水井，以及大批的其他引水工程，共扩大灌溉面积三百五十多万亩，改善灌溉面积二百五十多万亩。县、社工业生产了一千多台排灌机械、三万五千多部水车，以及简易提水工具十三万多件。这些水利工程和排灌机械不但在抗旱中发挥了重大威力，对改善今后农田灌溉也有很大作用。现在，全省人民在取得抗灾丰收以后，又积极展开了以兴修水利为中心的冬季生产活动。
