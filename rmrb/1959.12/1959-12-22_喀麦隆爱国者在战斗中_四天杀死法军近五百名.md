　　Cameroonian Patriots in Battle
    Nearly Five Hundred French Troops Killed in Four Days
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 20th: The "Voice of Cameroon" radio station here broadcast today that in the battles from December 1st to 4th, Cameroonian patriots killed four hundred and ninety-three French colonial military officers and soldiers.
    The radio station went on to say that during this period, Cameroonian patriots also captured two French military commanders in Bangou and destroyed two police stations in Bamengou. When the radio station talked about the Western so-called Cameroonian war as a "civil war," it pointed out that the entire nation is fighting against foreign troops, and this is not a "civil war."
    In refuting the Westerners' insistence that Cameroonian patriots are "terrorists," the radio station said that even a reporter for London's "Observer" admitted that it was the French army that was massacring and looting the Cameroonian people.
    The radio station went on to say that to ask the Cameroonian people to tie their hands in front of foreign plunderers is tantamount to asking them to commit suicide.

　　喀麦隆爱国者在战斗中
    四天杀死法军近五百名
    新华社开罗20日电　据这里的“喀麦隆的话”电台今天广播说，在12月1日到4日的战斗中，喀麦隆爱国者杀死了四百九十三名法国殖民军官兵。
    这家电台接着说，在这期间，喀麦隆爱国者还在班古俘获了两名法军指挥官，在巴门古炸毁了两个警察所。电台在谈到西方所谓的喀麦隆战争是一场“内战”的说法时指出，全国人民都在打击外国军队，这不是“内战”。
    在驳斥西方人士硬说喀麦隆爱国者是“恐怖分子”的说法时，电台说，甚至伦敦的“观察家报”的记者也承认，屠杀和洗劫喀麦隆人民的正是法国军队。
    电台接着说，要喀麦隆人民在外国掠夺者面前束缚住自己的手脚，就等于要他们自杀。
