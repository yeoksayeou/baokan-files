Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st -- The Tangshan Steel Plant has comprehensively completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule.

　　The total output value plan of the plant was completed twenty-six and a half days ahead of schedule, the output plans for steel ingots and steel products were completed twenty-one days and eighteen days ahead of schedule respectively, the output plan for refractory materials was completed forty-eight days ahead of schedule, the qualified rate of converter steel made from small blast furnace iron exceeded the national plan by 0.91％, the qualified rate of steel products reached more than 99％, the pig iron consumption per ton of steel was reduced by twelve kilograms compared with the plan, the total cost of the plant was lower than the plan by 9.24％, and the total labor productivity exceeded the plan by 2.9％. Due to the improvement of technical level, the variety of products has also increased this year. The converter steel has increased from seven kinds last year to ten kinds. New products with higher quality requirements have been produced. The steel produced by the small rolling mill has also increased to more than thirty kinds.

　　The production task of Tangshan Steel Plant this year is much larger than last year. At the beginning of the year, a few cadres lacked confidence in completing this year's production task. In response to this situation, the factory Party committee launched a mass campaign to air views and debate, and at the same time, went deep into the front line of production, summarized advanced experience, and used the advanced deeds of high-yield, high-quality, and low-consumption of steelmaking groups such as Wang Yiyuan to educate workers, overcome the right-leaning and fear-of-difficulty emotions of a few cadres, and establish confidence in continuing the leap forward. Entering the second quarter, the supply of raw materials was insufficient, and the Party committee mobilized the masses to reduce the consumption of raw materials in every possible way and tap the potential of raw materials, so that the output and quality continued to rise. Compared with January of this year, steel production in October increased by 311％; the qualified rate of converter steel increased by 12.01％, reaching more than 99％; and the pig iron consumption per ton of steel decreased by 329 kilograms.

　　This factory has firmly grasped the important link of technical innovation and the promotion of advanced experience this year, and launched a large-scale mass movement. The factory’s employees put forward more than 400 major innovation suggestions for the key points in production, which powerfully promoted production.

　　According to Xinhua News Agency, the employees of Pingxiang Coal Mine, with the traditional revolutionary spirit, swept away right-leaning ideas and overcame difficulties. Under the conditions of insufficient pit props, equipment, and labor, they comprehensively completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it. As of December 15, raw coal has exceeded 11.51％, coking coal has exceeded 9％, coke has exceeded 16％, total footage of tunneling has exceeded 3％, coal quality has exceeded the national standard by 6％, total output has exceeded 3％, profits turned over to the state have exceeded 26.86％, labor productivity has exceeded 3.7％, and costs have been reduced by 3.09％ compared with the national plan.

　　At the beginning of this year, the coal mine encountered the difficulty of insufficient supply of pit props, and the supply of pit props was short of 12,000 cubic meters in the first five months. This will directly affect the tunneling of the working face and the increase of raw coal production. At that time, a few people believed that "production cannot be carried out without pit props" and put forward the right-leaning conservative proposition of "determining production according to materials." The Party committee of the Mining Bureau resolutely refuted these wrong arguments, and used the glorious revolutionary struggle history of the employees of Pingxiang Coal Mine and the vivid examples of the great leap forward last year to educate all employees, calling on them to carry forward the revolutionary tradition, make great efforts in technical innovation, and overcome the difficulties of insufficient pit props. The mine’s employees enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party committee and quickly came up with effective ways to overcome the difficulties of pit props from three aspects, ensuring the continued leap forward in production. After June, the Party committee of the Mining Bureau promptly promoted advanced experience, carried out competitions, and overcame the difficulties of insufficient manpower and equipment, so that the daily output of raw coal quickly exceeded the mark of 15,000 tons, and won the honorary title of the national coal mine large-area high-yield red flag bureau. According to Xinhua News Agency, the Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule and comprehensively. Among them, the total output value plan was completed on December 1, exceeding the plan by 0.13％. As of the 14th, the completion of other indicators was: the output of raw coal exceeded the annual plan by 2,146 tons, the ash powder rate of raw coal was lower than the national plan by 0.5％, labor productivity increased by 9％, and costs decreased by 1.39％.

　　The main reason why Xishan Mining Bureau was able to achieve comprehensive leap forward this year is that they constantly criticized right-leaning conservative thinking and established the confidence in achieving comprehensive leap forward with greater, faster, better and more economical results. In order to combine hard work and practical work with skillful work, the Party committee of the Mining Bureau led all employees of the mine to carry out a vigorous technical innovation movement. As of the end of November, the mine’s employees had put forward a total of 7,195 innovation proposals, of which 3,955 had been implemented, creating a value of 3.86 million yuan. At the same time, many advanced experiences were vigorously promoted. In August, the bureau promoted 33 major advanced experiences, which increased to 59 in November. In addition, 22 advanced experiences of this unit were summarized and promoted.

　　唐山钢厂和萍乡西山两煤矿
    跃进信心足  钢煤全面红
    三厂矿全年计划提前完成
    据新华社天津21日电　唐山钢厂已经全面提前完成今年国家计划。
    全厂生产总值计划提前二十六天半完成，钢锭、钢材产量计划分别提前二十一天多和十八天多完成，耐火材料产量计划提前四十八天完成，用小高炉铁炼出的转炉钢合格率超过国家计划0.91％，钢材合格率达到99％以上，每吨钢的生铁消耗量比计划降低十二公斤，全厂总成本低于计划9.24％，全员劳动生产率超过计划2.9％。由于技术水平提高，今年产品品种也增加了，转炉钢由去年的七种增加到十种，生产出了质量要求较高的新产品，小型轧钢车间生产的钢材也增加到三十多种。
    唐山钢厂今年的生产任务比去年增加很大，年初曾有少数干部对完成今年生产任务缺乏信心。工厂党委针对这种情况，发动群众展开鸣放辩论，同时，深入生产第一线，总结先进经验，用王益元等炼钢小组高产、优质、低耗的先进事例，教育工人，克服少数干部的右倾畏难情绪，树立起继续跃进的信心。进入第二季度，原料供应不足，党委又发动群众千方百计地降低原料消耗，大挖原料潜力，使产量、质量不断上升。以今年10月份与1月份比较：钢产量增长了311％；转炉钢合格率提高了12.01％，达到99％以上；每吨钢的生铁消耗量降低三百二十九公斤。
    这个厂今年紧紧抓住技术革新和推广先进经验这个重要环节，大搞群众运动。全厂职工针对生产中的关键，提出了四百多项重大革新建议，有力地推动了生产。
    据新华社讯　萍乡煤矿职工以传统的革命精神横扫右倾，战胜困难，在坑木、设备和劳力不足的情况下，全面提前超额完成了今年国家计划。到12月15日止，原煤已经超额11.51％，炼焦精煤超额9％，焦炭超额16％，掘进总进尺超额3％，煤炭质量超过国家规定标准6％，总产量超额3％，上缴利润超额26.86％，劳动生产率超额3.7％，成本则比国家计划降低3.09％。
    今年一开始，这个煤矿便遇到了坑木供应不足的困难，头五个月内坑木供应缺一万二千立方米。这将直接影响到工作面的掘进和原煤生产的增加。当时，有少数人认为“没有坑木就不能生产”，并且提出了“以料定产”的右倾保守主张。矿务局党委坚决反击了这些错误论点，并且以萍乡煤矿职工的光荣革命斗争历史和去年大跃进中的生动事例，向全体职工进行了教育，号召他们发扬革命传统，大闹技术革新，克服坑木不足的困难。全矿职工热烈响应党委的号召，很快想出了从三个方面克服坑木困难的有效办法，保证了生产继续跃进。6月份以后，矿务局党委及时推广先进经验，开展竞赛，战胜人力和设备不足的困难，使原煤日产量很快突破了一万五千吨大关，获得了全国煤矿大面积高产红旗局的光荣称号。据新华社讯　太原西山矿务局提前全面完成今年国家计划。其中，总产值计划在12月1日超额0.13％完成，其它各项指标截至14日止，完成的情况是：原煤产量超额二千一百四十六吨完成全年计划，原煤的灰粉率比国家计划降低0.5％，劳动生产率提高9％，成本降低1.39％。
    西山矿务局今年能够取得全面跃进的成就，主要原因是他们不断批判了右倾保守思想，树立了多快好省全面跃进的信心。为了把苦干实干和巧干结合起来，矿务局党委领导全矿职工开展了轰轰烈烈的技术革新运动。截至11月底止，全矿职工共提出革新建议七千一百九十五件，实现了三千九百五十五件，创造价值三百八十六万元。与此同时，大力推广许多先进经验，8月份全局推广重大先进经验三十三种，11月份又增加到五十九种，另外总结和推广了本单位的先进经验二十二种。
