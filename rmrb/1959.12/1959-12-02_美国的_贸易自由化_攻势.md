The U.S. "Trade Liberalization" Offensive
Wan Feng

During the 15th plenary session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) held recently in Tokyo, the United States launched a fierce "trade liberalization" offensive against Japan and Western European countries, attempting to force these countries to open their doors to the influx of American goods.

Offensive Drums Beat Tightly

The U.S. "trade liberalization" offensive began sounding the drums of war as early as the special meeting on import restrictions held in Tokyo from October 12 to 28 by the participating countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Under the control of the United States, the meeting put Japan, Italy, and five other capitalist countries in the "defendant's seat" on the pretext of reviewing whether certain countries' import restrictions were appropriate.

During the 15th plenary session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, held from October 26 to November 20, the U.S. "offensive" became even more aggressive.

On October 25, on the eve of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade meeting, the U.S. State Department issued a statement, pointing at Western European countries and saying: It is no longer justifiable to restrict imports of dollar area goods on the grounds of international balance of payments difficulties. On the same day, the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund also issued a resolution with the same content, demanding that Western European countries and Japan open their markets to American goods. It is also worth noting that the United States sent Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Dillon to attend the Tokyo meeting. Dillon repeatedly threatened Western European countries and Japan at the meeting, attempting to force them to remove restrictions on the import of American goods and accusing these countries of "discriminating" against dollar area goods. He described these countries' restrictions on American goods as "presenting unpleasant prospects" and threatened them that the United States would restore "protectionism and restrictive actions." During the meeting, the United States also took advantage of the fierce disputes between the "Little Free Trade Area" led by Britain and the "Common Market" centered on West Germany to serve its own purposes. While attacking West Germany as a "stubborn fortress," the United States also directed Japan to attack European economic groups. On November 19, the United States suddenly announced that all money borrowed from the "Development Loan Fund" must be used to buy American goods, which was clearly an attempt to force these capitalist countries to submit.

The U.S. Suffering Repeated Setbacks in the "Trade War"

It is no coincidence that the United States seized this meeting to launch a "trade liberalization" offensive. In recent years, the United States has shifted from an active to a passive position and suffered repeated setbacks in the "trade war" in the Western world. The deterioration of the trade balance, coupled with the increase in overseas aggression expenses, has led to a sharp increase in the U.S. international balance of payments deficit. The monopoly position of the U.S. dollar as the "world currency" is increasingly shaken. Improving the trade balance, and thus improving the overall international balance of payments, has become the most pressing issue for U.S. monopoly capital at present.

According to the materials from the roundtable discussion by the "Asahi Shimbun" correspondents stationed in the United States, serialized by the Japanese newspaper in early November, several major capitalist countries trading with the United States this year have already changed from import surplus to export surplus, and some have a large export surplus. From January to August last year, France had an import surplus of 123 million U.S. dollars in trade with the United States, but in the same period this year, it had an export surplus of 105 million U.S. dollars. During the same period, West Germany's trade with the United States also changed from an import surplus of 87 million U.S. dollars to an export surplus of 115 million U.S. dollars. In Anglo-American trade, Britain has always had an import surplus. However, since last year, Britain has begun to have an export surplus with the United States. Since the beginning of this year, the export surplus has been increasing day by day, from 46 million U.S. dollars from January to August last year to 247 million U.S. dollars this year. In the post-war period, Japan had always been in a subordinate position in U.S.-Japan trade, and had always had a unilateral import surplus. Last year, Japan's trade deficit with the United States reached 151 million U.S. dollars. But this year, even Japan has an export surplus with the United States. In the first half of this year, Japan's export surplus was 18.7 million U.S. dollars; if calculated from January to August, the export surplus reached 47.8 million U.S. dollars.

The main reasons for the U.S.'s repeated setbacks in the "trade war" in the Western capitalist world are: First, in recent years, due to the intensification of uneven capitalist development, the U.S.'s economic position in the capitalist world has been declining. After the war, the U.S. economy suffered from three crises in 1948-1949, 1953-1954, and 1957-1958, and production declined severely. However, Western European countries and Japan, whose economies were severely damaged in World War II, have been carrying out large-scale equipment renewal and technological innovation since 1948, especially around 1954. The speed of economic recovery and "growth" has exceeded that of the United States, and they have not suffered as severe crises as the United States. According to statistics published by the United Nations, from 1953 to 1958, Japan's industrial production index increased by 69, France increased by 53, West Germany increased by 52, Italy increased by 41, and Britain increased by 14. But the United States was standing still. As Western European countries and Japan quickly completed the post-war economic recovery process, not only did their demand for American goods greatly decrease, but they also desperately competed with the United States for markets in order to get rid of the crisis of overproduction. Therefore, the U.S.'s share of world export trade has been declining. According to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's 1957-1958 annual report, the U.S.'s share decreased from 24% in 1948 to 16.5% in 1954, and further decreased to 15.5% in 1958. Western European countries, especially West Germany, had already surpassed Britain in 1958 and become the second largest exporter of industrial products after the United States. Japan's share of export trade in the capitalist world was only 1.8% in 1953, but it jumped to 3% in 1958.

Second, the competitiveness of American goods continues to weaken, affecting export increases. As a result of the militarization of the national economy, U.S. military expenditures have been increasing year after year, causing financial difficulties. The inflationary measures taken by the United States to ease financial difficulties have caused price increases, raising the export prices of goods. The export prices of American goods have been rising since 1953; while the export prices of competing countries have remained the same, or even decreased more or less. Therefore, many American goods cannot compete with Western Europe and Japan. The most typical example is automobiles. In the trade of automobiles and auto parts, the United States' exports in the first half of 1955 were 669 million U.S. dollars, imports were 43 million U.S. dollars, and the export surplus was 626 million U.S. dollars. However, in the first half of 1959, exports were 605 million U.S. dollars, imports were 424 million U.S. dollars, and the export surplus decreased sharply. "U.S. News & World Report" said: "Currently, for every American-made sedan exported, five foreign-made cars are imported into the United States."

Third, because most of the raw materials for American industrial production rely on imports, and these raw materials are mostly used for military production, although exports are constantly being reduced, imports have been increasing, which is also an important factor causing the deterioration of the U.S. trade balance. For example, in September this year, U.S. export trade was sluggish, but imports reached 1.39 billion U.S. dollars, setting a record for monthly imports.

In order to reverse the decline in trade, the United States internally is further intensifying the exploitation of workers and curbing excessive inflation on the basis of production "rationalization," and externally it wants to rely on its advantages and "creditor" status still maintained in the capitalist camp to force these countries to break down barriers and accept the "trade liberalization" policy of buying more American goods.

Japan Bears the Brunt

Judging from a series of facts before and after this meeting, Japan is the most severely hit by the U.S. "trade liberalization" offensive. This year, Japan has experienced an export surplus for the first time in its trade with the United States, and Japanese monopoly capital is doing everything possible to find markets for its goods in the United States, which has greatly annoyed U.S. monopoly capital. Given Japan's subordinate position to the United States in politics and economics, the United States first targets Japan. From U.S. Ambassador to Japan MacArthur II's speech on U.S.-Japan relations in August this year to the U.S.-Japan negotiations on Japan's purchase of American jet fighters, the United States has repeatedly forced Japan to buy more American goods. The United States also threatened Japan with restrictions on the import of Japanese goods to force Japan to open its market to American goods. Eisenhower announced on October 22 this year the decision to increase tariffs on stainless steel knives and forks, etc., that exceed the quota. Cutlery and other tableware are important commodities exported by Japan to the United States. Furthermore, in the past, nearly half of the funds obtained by other countries from the U.S. "Development Loan Fund" were used to order Japanese or Western European goods. The recent announcement by the United States that this fund must be used to buy American goods has severely hit Japan, which relies on "overseas procurement" orders to earn U.S. dollars. Since the beginning of this year, the United States has been continuously carrying out activities to restrict the import of Japanese goods, regardless of Japan's repeated "voluntary reductions." Following the cotton textile negotiations to lower Japan's export quota to the United States, the United States is now seeking to restrict the import of Japanese tuna, semiconductor radios, chemical fiber products, and other commodities. During this meeting, Japan was again forced to agree to relax restrictions on ten kinds of dollar area commodities next year, but the United States is still not satisfied and demands that Japan immediately lift restrictions on American goods. According to a November 13 "Yomiuri Shimbun" editorial, under pressure from the United States, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry determined on November 11 the specific measures for Japan's "trade liberalization" in the second half of this year, and import restrictions will be eased on 181 commodities. Among them, many commodities such as automobiles are precisely what the United States urgently demands.

"A New Decisive Stage"

After this Tokyo meeting, although Britain, France, Japan, and other countries expressed their willingness to relax restrictions and slightly ease the import of American goods, the U.S. "offensive" was not successful on the whole. Until now, West Germany has not expressed a clear attitude. The U.S.'s activities at the meeting to help Japan request the 14 member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to grant Japan most-favored-nation treatment as a condition for Japan to relax the import of American goods also failed. Britain, France, and the "Common Market" countries will continue to strengthen restrictions on the import of Japanese goods in the future. Given Japan's dependence on and subordination to the United States in trade, Japan will inevitably engage in more intense trade struggles with the United States in the future, under the dual squeeze of the United States and Western European countries. Moreover, as American goods flood into Western Europe, and Western Europe and Japan compete for markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America, the "trade war" in the capitalist world will definitely become more intense. Tokyo meeting chairman Ordini publicly pointed out that this "trade war" has entered a "new decisive stage," and "many problems that were previously hidden behind the facade of balance of payments restrictions have now been brought to the surface and must be faced." This is absolutely true.

    美国的“贸易自由化”攻势
    万峰
    最近在东京召开的关税及贸易总协定第十五次全会期间，美国向日本及西欧国家发动了一个“贸易自由化”的猛烈攻势，企图迫使这些国家为美国货的涌入洞开门户。
    进攻锣鼓阵阵紧
    美国的“贸易自由化”攻势，早在10月12日至28日关税及贸易总协定参加国在东京召开的专门讨论限制进口问题的会议上，就擂起了催阵鼓。在美国控制下，会议以审查某些国家限制进口作法是否合适为由，把日本、意大利等七个资本主义国家置于“被告席”上。
    在10月26日到11月20日举行的关税及贸易总协定第十五次全体会议期间，美国的“攻势”变得更加咄咄逼人。
    在10月25日，即贸易及关税总协定会议的前夕，美国国务院就发表了一个声明，指着西欧国家说：以国际收支困难为理由，限制美元区货物进口，早已说不通了。同一天，国际货币基金组织理事会会议也发表了一个内容相同的决议，要求西欧国家和日本对美货开放市场。还值得注意的是，美国派遣了负责经济事务的副国务卿狄龙出席东京的会议。狄龙在会上再三威胁西欧国家和日本，企图迫使它们取消对美货进口的限制，并指责这些国家“歧视”美元区货物。他把这些国家对美国货限制说成是
  “出现令人不愉快的前景”，并威胁这些国家说，美国将恢复“保护主义和限制性行动”。在会议期间，美国还利用以英国为首的“小自由贸易区”同以西德为核心的“共同市场”两个经济集团之间的激烈争吵，为它自己的目的服务。美国在攻击西德为“顽固堡垒”的同时，又指使日本向欧洲的经济集团开炮。11月19日美国突然宣布，今后凡是从“开发贷款基金会”借的钱，都必须买美国货，更显然是企图迫使这些资本主义国家就范。
    美国在“贸易战”中节节失利
    美国抓住这次会议发动“贸易自由化”攻势，不是偶然的。近年来，美国在西方世界的“贸易战”中，已经由主动转为被动，节节失利。贸易收支情况恶化，加上海外侵略活动费用的增加，促使美国国际收支赤字急剧增大。美元作为“世界通货”的垄断地位日益动摇。改善贸易收支状况，从而改善整个国际收支状况，已成为美国垄断资本当前最紧迫的问题。
    据今年11月上旬日本“朝日新闻”连载的该报驻美国记者总站座谈会记录材料，今年同美国进行贸易的几个主要资本主义国家，都已经由入超变为出超，有的并且出超很多。去年1月至8月，法国在对美贸易中入超一亿二千三百万美元，但是今年同期却有了一亿零五百万美元的出超。在同一时期里，西德在对美贸易中，也从八千七百万美元的入超变成一亿一千五百万美元的出超。在英美贸易中，英国一向是入超的。但从去年起，英国对美开始出超。今年以来出超更日益增加，从去年1月到8月的出超四千六百万美元，增加到今年的二亿四千七百万美元。日本在战后由于在日美贸易中一直处于从属地位，过去总是单方面的入超。去年日本对美贸易的赤字达一亿五千一百万美元。但是在今年就连日本对美国也变成了出超。今年上半年日本出超一千八百七十万美元；如果从1月到8月计算，则出超达四千七百八十万美元。
    美国在西方资本主义世界的“贸易战”中节节失利的主要原因：第一，近年来由于资本主义发展不平衡加剧，美国在资本主义世界中的经济地位不断下降。战后美国经济遭受过1948—1949年、1953—1954年和1957—1958年三次危机的侵袭，生产严重地减退。而在第二次世界大战中经济遭受严重破坏的西欧国家和日本，则从1948年以来，特别是1954年前后大搞设备更新和技术革新，经济恢复和“增长”速度都超过了美国，而且又没有遭受像美国那样严重的危机打击。据联合国公布的统计材料，从1953年到1958年五年内，日本的工业生产指数增加了六十九，法国增加了五十三，西德增加了五十二，意大利增加了四十一，英国增加了十四。但是美国却在原地踏步不前。由于西欧国家和日本很快地完成战后经济恢复过程，不仅对美国商品需求大减，而且它们为了摆脱生产过剩危机，还拼命地同美国争夺市场。因此，美国在世界出口贸易中所占比重便不断下降。据关税及贸易总协定1957—1958年度报告，1954年美国所占比重从1948年的24％减到16.5％，1958年更减为15.5％。而西欧国家，特别是西德在1958年已经超过英国，成为仅次于美国的工业产品输出国。日本在资本主义世界出口贸易中所占比重，1953年仅为1.8％，1958年则一跃而为3％。
    第二，美国商品的竞争能力不断削弱，影响出口增加。由于国民经济军事化的结果，美国军费开支连年增加，造成财政困难。美国为了缓和财政困难所采取的通货膨胀办法，造成物价上涨，提高了商品出口价格。美国商品的出口价格，从1953年以来一直是上升的；而竞争对手国的出口价格却维持原状，甚至或多或少地下降了。因此，美国的许多商品都竞争不过西欧和日本。最典型的例子是汽车。美国在汽车及汽车部件的贸易中，1955年上半年出口为六亿六千九百万美元，进口为四千三百万美元，出超为六亿二千六百万美元。但是，在1959年上半年，出口为六亿零五百万美元，进口则为四亿二千四百万美元，出超额锐减。“美国新闻与世界报道”说：“目前每出口一辆美制轿车，就有五辆外国制造的汽车输入美国。”
    第三，由于美国工业生产原料大部分靠进口，而这些原料又大部分用于军事生产，因此，尽管出口不断削减，进口反而一直在增加，这也是造成美国贸易收支恶化的一个重要因素。例如今年9月美国出口贸易不景气，进口却达十三亿九千万美元，创了月份进口额的最高纪录。
    美国为了挽回贸易上的颓势，对内是在生产“合理化”基础上进一步加紧剥削工人和制止通货过分膨胀，对外就是要依靠它迄今在资本主义阵营内还保有的优势和“债主”地位，强迫这些国家破除壁垒，接受多买美国货的“贸易自由化”政策。
    日本首当其冲
    从这次会议前后的一系列事实来看，在美国“贸易自由化”攻势下，遭受打击最重的要算日本。今年日本在对美国的贸易中，第一次出现了出超，日本垄断资本又千方百计地为它的商品在美国寻找市场，使美国垄断资本甚为恼火。鉴于日本在政治、经济上所处的对美从属地位，美国便首先拿日本开刀。从今年8月美国驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二发表美日关系的谈话，直到日美谈判日本购买美国喷气式战斗机问题，美国一再迫使日本多买美国货。美国还以限制日货进口来胁迫日本为美货开放市场。艾森豪威尔在今年10月22日宣布了对超过定额进口的不锈钢刀叉等增加关税的决定。刀叉等餐具是日本向美国出口的重要商品之一。再者，因为过去其他国家从美国“开发贷款基金会”所取得的款项，几乎有一半用来订购日货或西欧商品。美国最近宣布必须用这笔款项买美国货的规定，严重地打击了依靠“海外采购”订货赚取美元的日本。今年以来，美国不顾日本的一再“自动削减”，不断地在进行限制日货进口的活动。继棉织品谈判压低日本对美出口定额后，最近美国又要限制日本鲔鱼、半导体收音机、化学纤维制品等商品的进口。在这次会议期间，日本又被迫答应于明年放宽对十种美元区商品的限制，但美国仍不满足，要求日本立即取消对美国货的限制。据11月13日“读卖新闻”社论说，迫于美国的压力，日本通商产业省于11月11日确定了今年下半年日本“贸易自由化”具体措施，缓和进口限制的将有一百八十一种商品。其中如汽车等多种商品，正是美国所迫切要求的。
    “新的决定性阶段”
    经过这次东京会议，虽然英、法、日等国表示愿意放宽限制，稍稍放宽了一些美货进口。但是，整个说来美国的“攻势”没有成功。直到现在，西德仍未表示明确的态度。美国在会上作为对日本放宽美货进口的交换条件，帮助日本要求关税及贸易总协定十四个成员国给日本最惠国待遇的活动也失败了。英、法及“共同市场”各国在今后继续加强对日货进口限制。鉴于日本在贸易上对美国的从属和依赖关系，在遭受美国和西欧国家的双重挤压下，日本今后必然同美国进行更加激烈的贸易斗争。而且随着美货大量涌进西欧，以及西欧和日本向东南亚及拉丁美洲市场的争夺，资本主义世界的“贸易战”定会更加激烈。东京会议主席奥尔迪尼就公开指出，这一“贸易战”已进入了一个“新的决定性阶段”，“过去多少是隐蔽在支付平衡限制的门面背后的很多问题，目前已经提到表面上来而且必须正视它”。这是千真万确的。
