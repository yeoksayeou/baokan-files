    Yellow River Downstream Begins Ice Prevention
    The Yellow River has entered the ice flood season, and both banks of the lower reaches have begun to deploy efforts to prevent ice disasters.
    According to the new characteristics of the river channel narrowing and the water level rising this year, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters requires Henan and Shandong provinces to strengthen the protection of dikes, and the upper reaches should try to use the Yellow River irrigation canals and sluices to divert river water. The sections near the estuary should try to discharge river water into the Bohai Sea, which can reduce and avoid the threat of ice jams raising the water level.
