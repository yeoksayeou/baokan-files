	"Ice Train" Shows Its Power
	The "ice train" in Inner Mongolia has played a huge role in short-distance transportation. This "ice train" uses mechanical, animal, and human power to pull sleds, transporting materials on frozen rivers or artificially watered ice roads. The "ice train" has a large carrying capacity, with each sled capable of carrying two to three tons, making it five times more efficient than animal-powered vehicles. Using this transportation method can save a large amount of manpower, draft animals, and vehicles.
	Currently, the "ice train" is widely used in the Greater Khingan Mountains area. The Zalaite Banner in the Hulunbuir League has opened an ice road trunk line on the Chor River to rush grain to the railway line. The Greater Khingan Mountains forest area has also built more than 500 kilometers of ice roads.

    “冰上列车”逞威风
    内蒙古“冰上列车”在短途运输中发挥了巨大作用。这种“冰上列车”是运用机械、畜力和人力牵引爬犁，在封冻的河流或人工浇灌的冰道上运输物资。“冰上列车”运量大，每台爬犁能载重二、三吨，比畜力车效率高五倍。使用这种运输方法，可节省大批人力、役畜和车辆。
    目前大兴安岭地区已广泛使用“冰上列车”。呼伦贝尔盟扎赉特旗在绰尔河上开辟了一条冰道干线，赶运粮食到铁路沿线。大兴安岭林区也修了冰道五百多公里。
