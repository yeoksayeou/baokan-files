New Achievements in Dance Drama Music
    ——Watching the "Fish Beauty" Performance
    Li Ling
    Following "Five Red Clouds," "Shi Yi Cuts Firewood," and the newly revised "Lotus Lantern," the dance drama art scene has produced another new and congratulatory work, "Fish Beauty."

    The story of "Fish Beauty" is taken from Chinese folk tales, depicting the struggle between good and evil. It elucidates this theme through the love between the Fish Beauty and the young hunter, and their fight against the Mountain Demon who wants to possess the Fish Beauty for the victory of pure love.

    The dance of the dance drama is roughly based on Chinese folk and classical dance materials, using ballet choreography techniques to express it. It has made very bold attempts in the development of dance language, character personality, and plot depiction, giving higher play to the drama of the dance drama.  Creating a new dance drama requires various explorations, and it is inevitable that there will be successes, things worth studying, and even different disputes. I don't want to say much more about this. As for the music of "Fish Beauty," I think it is very successful.

    The main point of its success is that the music far exceeds the arrangement as the beat of the dance. It has indeed become the soul of the dance drama and the basis for the development of the dance drama's plot.

    The good and evil themes of the music are very distinct. The music of the hunter, the Fish Beauty, the Ginseng, the Seaweed, the Coral, and the various folk dances in the wedding, all show their common kind nature, and each has its own characteristics. In this regard, the Fish Beauty's gentleness, beauty, and deep affection, the young hunter's bravery, courage, and wit, the Ginseng's briskness, humor, simplicity, and loyalty, and the Coral's freshness, liveliness, and uniqueness are all relatively prominent.

    Many plots, because of the strong typical character of the music, such as in the first act when the young hunter leaves, the Fish Beauty admires his heroic posture. When the Fish Beauty uses dance language to compare her inner yearning, the progress of the music prominently portrays the young man's majestic image, which also more concretely describes the Fish Beauty's state of mind. In fact, in this dance, even if the Fish Beauty did not make a comparison and just thought quietly, the audience would also understand from the music what she was admiring. In this way, the music opens up a wider range of imagination for the dance.

    For example, in the third act, in the demon cave, when the Fish Beauty rejects the Mountain Demon's love and struggles very hard, the Ginseng's theme suddenly appears in the distance. The Fish Beauty immediately seems to gain hope, and the Mountain Demon is extremely afraid. The audience can also foresee that the Ginseng and the young hunter will arrive soon after hearing this segment of music. That is to say, the objects to be depicted on the stage have not appeared, but because the character of the music is written successfully, the audience will immediately imagine the development and changes of the plot after listening to it. This fully illustrates whether the typical character depiction of dance drama music is successful or not, and it is related to the depth and breadth of the dance itself.

    The music of the negative characters in "Fish Beauty" is also carved relatively successfully. The Mountain Demon's music is sinister and cruel, which is his essential characteristic. However, throughout the entire process, his music is not simply terrible. For example, in the second act, when the Mountain Demon appears invisibly, the music only makes a slight hint. When the Mountain Demon transforms into a Taoist priest and comes on stage, the musical image only presents his sinister face in the supporting chords, interwoven in a seemingly harmonious picture, so that many people participating in the wedding even believe that he is a good person. When the Mountain Demon transforms into a king to lure the young hunter, the music is superficially grand, only hinting at the truth of the plot in the effect of the orchestration. It can be seen that the composer has put a lot of thought into this arrangement.

    In addition, the music's description of the plot is excellent in many places. For example, when the young hunter initially rescues the Fish Beauty from the Mountain Demon, they both confide their love for each other; when the Fish Beauty discovers the young hunter in the seabed and is warmly concerned about him; and the young hunter's increasingly anxious mood in the third act when he is looking for his lover; and the music of the final fight and victory, all develop step by step, becoming deeper and richer, and are written very effectively.

    The music of the entire dance drama has further gains in the exploration and creation of national style. The orchestration of the music is also relatively complete. Each dance music theme is developed symphonically. The changes in timbre are relatively rich, and the contrast of the music has a better arrangement from the perspective of the entire dance drama. The first act is more affectionate, and the poetic meaning is more intense, and the persuasive power of the music is deeper and stronger. The second act is a bit close to a joyful suite, with more outward enthusiasm. In the third act, after several "foreign style" dances, the wine offering dance reverses the previous colors, followed by the fight and victorious celebration. In general, the beginning and end correspond, and the structure is relatively tight, unified, and varied. Except for a few places where it feels a bit lengthy, the contrast and development are still sufficient. Like this kind of dance music that can pay attention to all aspects, with characteristics, contrast, sufficient development, and relatively unified, is still rare at present.

    I have seen some dance drama music where the theme is not bad and there is a lot of material, but it often lacks editing and concentration, and there is a lack of correspondence between the beginning and the end. The music melody is very good, but there is little development, and the orchestration of the orchestra is either too heavy or too thin. The selection of modes is also relatively narrow, which can easily make people feel monotonous and lengthy. The music of "Fish Beauty" has new creations in these aspects, with more changes in orchestration and stronger symphonic development. For example, the counterpoint development of national melodies in dances such as the "Seashell Dance" also provides many new insights. I think that doing some research and discussion on this kind of dance drama music will be beneficial to the creation of our country's dance drama music.

    Regarding the character of the dance drama music, I think the Fish Beauty's theme has more gentleness and charm, but lacks enthusiasm and brilliance. Therefore, when her music is intertwined with the young hunter's music, it often feels like there is a lack of coordination. When it turns to the Fish Beauty's music, there is a sense of gloom and desolation. This impression is even more pronounced, especially when the chord falls on the lower fifth.

    Secondly, there is little difference between the music of the Seaweed Dance and the Amber Dance. The development of these two pieces is gradually increasing, and the mood and development are somewhat similar to the music of the Fish Beauty that is interspersed between these two dances; on the one hand, it weakens the appeal of the Fish Beauty's music, and it also seems lengthy.

    Also, the music at the beginning of the wedding dance in the second act is too gentle and lacks the fiery and lively earthy atmosphere of a folk wedding. The composer did not pay enough attention to the characters' environment and the nature of things. He almost depicted the wedding of the working people as a classical court atmosphere, which cannot but be a major shortcoming.

    The dance drama "Fish Beauty" was compiled under the guidance of Soviet expert P. A. Gusev. This dance drama has achieved such great success and made so many new creations in our country's dance drama. Comrade Gusev has put in a lot of effort. While we are enjoying the joy and encouragement brought by this new dance drama, we naturally think of the Soviet experts. Their guidance and help in dance and music are particularly valuable.

    舞剧音乐的新成就
    ——看“鱼美人”演出
    李凌
    舞剧艺术，继“五朵红云”、“石义砍柴”，以及重新整理的“宝莲灯”之后，又出现一个新的值得庆贺的“鱼美人”。
      “鱼美人”的故事，取材于我国民间传说，描写正义与邪恶的斗争，它通过鱼美人与青年猎人的相爱，他俩为着纯洁的爱情的胜利，和山妖想把鱼美人占为己有的搏斗，来阐述这一主题。
    舞剧的舞蹈，大致是根据中国民间、古典舞蹈素材，采用芭蕾的编导手法来表现，在舞蹈语言、人物性格、情节刻划的发展上，作出非常大胆的尝试，把舞剧的戏剧性发挥得较高。从创造新的舞剧，需要做出各种各样的探索来说，其间有成功的，有值得研究的，甚至有不同争论，这也是必然的。在这方面，我不想多说。至于“鱼美人”的音乐，我认为是非常成功的。
    成功的主要一点，是音乐远远地超过了作为舞蹈的节拍而安排的局面，它的确成为舞剧的灵魂，成为舞剧情节发展的依据。
    音乐的善与恶的主题，非常鲜明，猎人、鱼美人、人参、水草、珊瑚，以及婚礼中的各种民间舞蹈的音乐，各个的面貌，体现出它共同的善良性格，而又各有特点。在这方面，像鱼美人的娴淑、优美、深情，青年猎人的英勇、果敢、机智，人参的轻快、诙谐、纯朴、忠厚，珊瑚的清新、活泼、别致……都表现得比较突出。
    许多情节，因为音乐的典型性格较强，如第一幕当青年猎人走后，鱼美人羡慕他的英姿，当鱼美人用舞蹈语言来比拟她内心的追慕时，音乐的进行，突出地刻划了这青年的魁伟的形象，也就更加具体地描述出鱼美人的心境。其实在这段舞蹈中，如果鱼美人不作比拟，而只是静静思念，观众也会从音乐中，了解到她在倾慕什么，这样音乐就为舞蹈开拓了更深广的想像力。
    又如第三幕，在妖洞中当鱼美人拒绝山妖的爱情，挣扎非常艰险时，音乐突然在远处出现了人参的主题，鱼美人立刻像获得了希望，山妖则异常害怕，观众听到这个片段的音乐，也能预感到人参和青年猎人很快就要到来了。也即是说，舞台上要描写的事物对象没有出现，因为音乐的性格写得成功，听众听了以后，立刻就会想像到剧情的发展和变化。这充分说明了，舞剧音乐典型性格刻划的成功与否，它关系到舞蹈本身表现的深度和广度。
    关于“鱼美人”的反面角色的音乐，也是雕刻得比较成功的。山妖的音乐，阴险凶残，这是他带本质的特性。但是，整个过程，他的音乐并不单纯是可怕，像在第二幕中，山妖隐形出现，音乐只提出轻微的暗示。当山妖化身为道士上场时，音乐形象只在烘托的和弦中呈现出他的阴险面目，交织在一幅表面调协的画面里，使得许多参加婚礼的人，甚至相信他是好人。当山妖化身为国王诱骗青年猎人时，音乐表面冠冕堂皇，只在配器的效果中暗示情节的真相。这种安排，可以看到作曲者是花了不少心思的。
    此外，音乐对剧情的描述，有好些地方是优异的，像当青年猎人最初将鱼美人从山妖手中救出，他们俩互相倾诉恋慕；当鱼美人在海底发现了青年猎人，对他热情关切；以及第三幕中青年猎人为了找寻爱人越来越着急的心情；还有最后的对打、胜利时的音乐，都是一步一步发展，越来越深，越来越丰富，写得非常有效果。
    整个舞剧的音乐，在民族风格的探索和创造上，有进一步的收获。音乐的编配也比较完整。每一个舞蹈音乐主题，都得到交响性的发展。音色的变化比较丰富，音乐的对比，从全舞剧来说，有较好的安排。第一幕比较深情，诗的意味较为浓厚，音乐的说服力较深较强。第二幕有点近于欢乐的组曲，热情较外露。第三幕，在几首是“外国情调”的舞曲之后，献酒舞扭转了前面的色彩，继之对打，胜利欢腾，从大体来说，首尾相应，结构还算严紧，统一而又有变化，除了极少的地方感到有些冗长之外，对比与发展，做得还是充分的。像这样能面面注意到，既有特性、有对比，发展比较充分，比较统一的舞曲，在目前还是不多。
    曾见到有些舞剧音乐，主题不坏，材料不少，但每每缺乏剪裁和集中，前后缺少照应。音乐旋律很好，但少发展，乐队的配器，不是偏于浓重，就陷于单薄。调式的选择也比较狭窄，因而容易使人感到单调，冗长。而“鱼美人”的音乐，在这些方面有了新的创造，配器变化也多，交响性的发展也较强。余如“贝壳舞”等舞曲，对民族旋律的对位性的发展，也提供了不少新的见解。我想，对这种舞剧的音乐，能做一些研究、探讨，对我国的舞剧音乐的创造是会有好处的。
    关于舞剧音乐的性格，我认为鱼美人的主题，柔美、妩媚有余，热情、光辉不足，因而当她的音乐和青年猎人的音乐交织在一起时，每每感到缺少调协的因素，当一转到鱼美人的音乐，就有灰暗、凄凉之感。特别是当和弦落在下五度时这种印象更显出。
    其次，水草舞与琥珀舞的音乐，差别性不大，这两首曲子的发展，都是逐渐高涨，和间隔在这两个舞蹈之间的鱼美人的音乐，其情调和发展有些相类似；一方面减弱了鱼美人的音乐感染力，同时也显得冗长。
    还有第二幕的婚礼舞，起首的音乐偏于温雅，缺乏民间婚礼那种红火热闹的泥土气息。作曲者对人物的环境、事物的性质也注意得不够，他几乎把劳动人民的婚礼，描绘成为古典宫庭的气氛，这不能不是一个较大的缺憾。
    舞剧“鱼美人”是在苏联专家彼·安·古雪夫同志的指导下编成的，这个舞剧能有这么大的成绩，使我国舞剧能有这么多新的创造，古雪夫同志是花了不少心血的。我们在享受这个新舞剧所给的愉快与鼓舞的同时，也自然想到苏联专家，他们所给予我们的舞蹈与音乐的指导、帮助，是特别珍贵的。（附图片）
