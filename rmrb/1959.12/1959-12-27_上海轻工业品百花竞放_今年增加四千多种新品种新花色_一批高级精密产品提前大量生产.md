Shanghai, December 26th (Report from this newspaper) – Shanghai's light industry sector, amidst the continuous Great Leap Forward this year, has successfully trial-produced a large number of new varieties and designs to meet the growing needs of the people's lives.

From January to November this year, Shanghai's daily necessities factories trial-produced a total of 4,591 new designs and varieties. Based on the 2,148 new products that have already been put into production, an average of one new product was added in less than four hours. Many of these new products are high-end, precision products. High-end, precision cameras, color motion picture films, and optical glass, which had never been produced in China before, are now being produced in large quantities in Shanghai. The manufacturing technology and equipment requirements for these products are high. Some were originally planned to be trial-produced during the Third Five-Year Plan, but production has already begun. Other products, such as musical alarm clocks and seventeen-jewel long-hand women's watches, are also being produced in batches to meet market demand. The patterns on daily-use enamel products have been enriched this year with watercolor paintings and woodcut prints, reflecting a strong national style. In terms of cosmetics, Shanghai Grease Chemical Industry Company has trial-produced many high-end products this year, such as Golden Leaf Perfume, Bright Hair Mist, and Vitamin Cold Cream. The Food Industry Company and the Sports, Entertainment, Fine Arts, and Crafts Company have also produced dozens of children's nutritional foods and various novel and interesting toys for children this year.

The flourishing of new products in Shanghai's light industry this year is the result of the light industry sector resolutely implementing the Party's General Line, adhering to mass movements on a large scale, and actively implementing the "walking on two legs" principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods. Facts have proven that adopting indigenous methods and combining foreign and indigenous techniques to trial-produce new products can greatly accelerate the trial-production speed. For example, optical glass, which was originally planned to be trial-produced after the construction of a new factory, was trial-produced by making do with the premises of a thermos bottle factory before the factory was even built. During the trial production, lacking platinum crucibles, they built crucibles with refractory bricks; lacking automatic thermal control instruments, they used ordinary optical pyrometers to control the furnace temperature, overcoming various difficulties, and finally successfully trial-produced more than 30 varieties within five or six months.

Close cooperation and collaboration between departments not only made the trial production of new products faster but also ensured good quality. The main raw materials "color developers" and "sensitizers" used in the trial production of Shanghai color motion picture film had never been produced in China. Furthermore, the Shanghai Photosensitive Film Factory, which was tasked with the trial production of color motion picture film, was a newly established unit and did not have the resources to trial-produce these two raw materials. They contacted East China Institute of Chemical Technology, Shanghai Institute of Chemical Research, dye factories, and fragrance factories, and these units undertook the trial production and production of "color developers" and "sensitizers" through division of labor. After eight months of effort, they were finally successfully trial-produced, ensuring the early release of color motion picture film.

In order to trial-produce more new products faster, Shanghai's light industry sector has also established a complete set of management systems this year, adopting a hierarchical management approach for products with different requirements. For high-end products with very high-quality requirements that had never been manufactured before, the Industrial Bureau, specialized companies, and trial-production factories jointly formulated plans. New products with relatively high-quality requirements were managed by fourteen specialized companies, which organized veteran workers and technicians to form special groups for joint trial production. The increase in the variety of ordinary daily necessities was managed by each factory itself, with the superior companies conducting regular assessments and inspections. The adoption of this set of management methods, which strengthens leadership and gives full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, enables successfully trial-produced new products to be put into production quickly.

Currently, Shanghai's light industry sector is summarizing this year's experience and simultaneously arranging plans for the trial production of new products for next year, especially the first quarter. (Photos attached)

### 上海轻工业品百花竞放  今年增加四千多种新品种新花色　一批高级精密产品提前大量生产

　　上海轻工业品百花竞放
    今年增加四千多种新品种新花色　一批高级精密产品提前大量生产
    本报上海26日电　上海轻工业部门在今年继续跃进中，试制成功了大批新品种和新花色，以适应人民日益增长的生活需要。
    今年1至11月，上海市日用品工厂共试制成功了四千五百九十一种新花色和新品种，就其中已经投入生产的两千一百四十八种新产品来计算，平均不到四小时就增加一种新产品。这些新产品中有很多是高级、精密的产品。国内过去从来没有生产过的高级的、精密的照相机、五彩电影片、光学玻璃等，今年已在上海大量生产。这些产品制造技术、设备要求较高，有些本来准备在第三个五年计划期间试制，现在已开始生产了。其他如八音闹钟、十七钻长三针坤表，也都成批生产，供应市场需要。日用搪瓷制品上的花纹图案，今年又增加了水彩画、木刻画，富有民族风格。在化妆品方面，上海油脂化学工业公司今年试制了金叶香水、亮发香雾、维生素冷霜等不少高级产品。食品工业公司和体育文娱美术工艺公司，今年还为儿童们生产了几十种儿童营养食品和各种新颖有趣的玩具。
    上海轻工业今年新产品百花竞放，是轻工业部门坚决贯彻党的总路线、坚持大搞群众运动、积极贯彻土洋结合“两条腿走路”方针的结果。事实证明，采用土法上马、洋土结合的方法试制新产品，可以大大加快试制速度。例如，原来计划在筹建新厂以后再动手试制的光学玻璃，在工厂建成以前，就借热水瓶厂的厂房，因陋就简动手试制。试制的时候，没有白金坩埚，就用耐火砖砌个坩埚，没有热工自动控制仪，就改用一般光学高温计来掌握炉温，克服了种种困难，终于在五、六个月内试制成功了三十多种品种。
    各部门密切配合，加强协作，不仅使新产品试制得快，而且质量也好。上海试制五彩电影片所用的主要原料“成色剂”和“增感剂”，我国从未生产过，而承担五彩电影片试制任务的上海感光胶片厂又是一个新建单位，没有力量再试制这两种原料。它们便与华东化工学院、上海化工研究院和染料厂、香料厂联系，由这些单位分工承担“成色剂”和“增感剂”的试制、生产工作。经过八个月的努力，终于试制成功，保证了五彩电影片提前出厂。
    为了把新产品试制得更多更快，上海轻工业部门今年还建立了一套完整的管理制度，对不同要求的产品采取分级管理的办法。对产品质量要求很高，过去没有制造过的高级产品，都由工业局、专业公司和试制工厂共同制订规划。对产品质量要求较高的新产品，由十四个专业公司管理，组织老工人和技术人员，成立专门小组，共同试制。普通日用品花色品种的增加，由各厂自己掌握，上级公司定时评比检查。采用这一套既能加强领导又能发挥群众积极性的管理方法，使试制成功的新产品能很快投入生产。
    现在，上海轻工业部门正总结今年的经验，同时安排明年特别是第一季度的新产品试制计划。（附图片）
