Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, December 13th: The China First Automobile Works has successfully manufactured forging dies for a ten-ton forging hammer using cast steel overlay welding. Forgings produced with this type of die are of the same quality as those produced with alloy steel forging dies.

The First Ministry of Machine Building believes that this new technological achievement has opened up a new path for manufacturing large forging dies in China and has found a faster, better, and more economical way to realize die forging in forging production in China's machine industry.

Replacing the method of producing forgings without dies (free forging) with the method of producing forgings with dies is an important measure in the technological revolution of China's machine industry. Die forging produces products of higher quality than free forging, and can save two-fifths to four-fifths of metal and one-half to two-thirds of machining man-hours. However, the consumption of forging dies is very large. In the past, most of them had to be made of high-grade alloy steel containing elements such as nickel, chromium, and molybdenum, and the forging die blanks had to be manufactured with hydraulic presses.

The forging die for a ten-ton forging hammer manufactured by the China First Automobile Works using the cast steel overlay welding method has a body cast from medium-carbon manganese steel. A layer of alloy steel is welded onto the groove area of the die body using overlay welding (an advanced welding process). The experience of the China First Automobile Works proves that manufacturing forging dies using this method has four major advantages: First, the die body does not require alloy steel, which can save 95% of high-grade alloy steel, thus allowing for mass production. Second, it does not require forging with a hydraulic press, and the machine industry can universally manufacture forging dies, accelerating the process of realizing die forging in forging production in China. Third, the service life of these forging dies is no shorter than that of alloy steel forging dies, and may even be longer. Fourth, the cost of cast steel overlay welding forging dies is about three-quarters lower than that of alloy steel forging dies. The First Ministry of Machine Building has taken measures to rapidly promote this experience, and has decided to first promote it in five to ten key units immediately, and then implement it comprehensively.

    第一汽车厂为锻件生产模锻化找到一条新捷径
    用铸钢堆焊法造大型锻模
    新华社长春13日电　第一汽车制造厂用铸钢堆焊的方法制造成功十吨锻锤用的锻模。用这种锻模生产的锻件，质量和用合金钢锻模生产的完全一样。
    第一机械工业部认为这一新的技术成就，为我国制造大型锻模开辟了新的途径，对我国机械工业中锻件生产实现模锻化找到了一条多快好省的道路。
    用锻模生产锻件的方法来代替不用锻模（自由锻）生产锻件的方法，是我国机械工业技术革命的一项重要措施。模锻比自由锻生产的产品质量高，又可以节约二分之一到五分之四的金属和二分之一到三分之二的切削加工工时。但是，锻模的消耗量很大，过去绝大部分要采用含镍、铬、钼等元素的高级合金钢，锻模毛胚还必须用水压机才能制造。
    第一汽车制造厂用铸钢堆焊方法制造的十吨锻锤用的锻模，其本体是用中碳锰钢铸成的，用堆焊（一种先进的焊接工艺）的方法，在模体的型槽部位，焊上一层合金钢。第一汽车制造厂的经验证明，用这种方法制造锻模有四大好处：一、模体不用合金钢，可以节省95％的高级合金钢，因而可以大量制造。二、不需用水压机锻造，机械工业可以普遍的制造锻模，加快我国锻件生产实现模锻化的进程。三、这种锻模的使用寿命都不短于合金钢锻模，甚至更长。四、铸钢堆焊锻模的成本比合金钢锻模低四分之三左右。第一机械工业部已采取措施迅速推广这一经验，决定立即在五个到十个基点首先推广，然后再全面开花。
