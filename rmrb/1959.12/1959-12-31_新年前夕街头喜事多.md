Many Happy Events on the Streets on New Year's Eve
By Our Reporter

　　These days, Beijing's streets and alleys are filled with joy. People are celebrating the victory of the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959 and welcoming the new Great Leap Forward in 1960.

　　A Brigade Reporting Good News

　　One noon on New Year's Eve, a burst of gongs and drums reached the Fusuijing Street Party Committee. Du Ying, the Party Branch Secretary and Factory Director of the Fusuijing "July 1st" Hat Processing Factory, a red banner factory in Beijing's street production, led a group of female production leaders. They held high a banner that read "July 1st Hat Processing Factory Reporting Brigade, Announcing Completion of the Annual Production Target 22 Days Ahead of Schedule," to report good news to the Party Committee.

　　This reporting brigade was composed of more than forty women representatives, many of whom were production experts. Lu Chengxiang, who was once a housewife preoccupied with her kitchen, has now been评为 (rated as) a red banner bearer. In the factory's large-scale technical revolution, she created a two-handed operation method using a sewing machine to make hat surfaces, increasing production from thirty to two hundred per day. Lu Chengxiang's experience was quickly promoted throughout the factory, and her group was rated as an advanced group.

　　The "July 1st" Hat Processing Factory was established during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Initially, there were only eleven housewives and three sewing machines. Now, it has developed into a factory with more than three hundred people. Apart from two male workers, all the others in the factory are housewives. This year, they produced more than 90,000 hats, with a qualification rate of over 99%. Some products are even sold overseas.

　　Good News Arrives Home

　　Two days before New Year's Day, Sun Xingya, a comrade from the Civil Affairs Section of the Xuanwu District People's Committee, brought a commendation to Dong Hongqi's home in Xizhushikou. As soon as he entered the door, he excitedly said, "Auntie Dong, congratulations! The Railway Corps sent your son's commendation!" The old lady took the commendation, looked at the bright red characters of "Great Joy," and said repeatedly, "Good! Good!"

　　This good news immediately spread throughout the neighborhood. Grandma Fan, Aunt Jiang, and Aunt Chen all ran to congratulate Auntie Dong. Aunt Jiang said, "Her son Hongqi has made contributions, and his mother is so happy she can't close her mouth!" Lin Lianfang, the deputy director of the neighborhood committee, also came. She said, "Auntie Dong is truly blessed. Her daughter-in-law went out to work last year and was rated as a skillful girl and an excellent service worker. Now her son has also made contributions. This is truly glory for the whole family!" Chen Fengying, Hongqi's wife, rushed home from the Zhengyangmen Hotel, her face full of smiles. The scene of her and Hongqi competing to make progress last year flashed through her mind again. Since then, Hongqi has been constantly writing letters, telling her that he has often been praised by his superiors and that he has been rated as a five-good soldier after joining the army. Chen Fengying also wrote letters to Dong Hongqi, telling him about her achievements as a skillful girl, a young red banner bearer, and an excellent service worker. Now that she has heard that her lover has received a third-class merit award in the year-end appraisal, she feels an indescribable excitement.

　　Housewives Practice Singing and Dancing

　　Guo Chunhua, a nursery worker from Mianhua Shangtou Tiao Street, danced with seven housewives, waving a fan in one hand and shaking a small bell in the other. They raised their fans for a while, then waved their handkerchiefs, singing and dancing, very lively.

　　These housewives walked out of their homes in the Great Leap Forward of 1958. Some joined street factories to produce, some became nursery workers, and some worked in street service stations. Ju Ying, the neighborhood director, said with a smile to the reporter: "Don't laugh at us. None of us used to dance, but now we are happy, and it's New Year's, so we want to have some fun and even participate in the district's literary and artistic performance."

　　Li Xiurong performed the best in the dance. Na Juying said, "Of course she performs well, someone is directing her." Li Xiurong, whose lover works in the orchestra of the Peking Opera Troupe, denied, "Who directed me? I am happy in my heart, and I feel that participating in work is meaningful, so I performed well."

　　Long Live the Three Red Banners

　　The curtain on the stage of the Children's Hall of the Youth Palace opened, and in front of more than six hundred children appeared the starry night sky of Tiananmen Square. The radiant New Year's old man congratulated the children in a loud voice under the night sky "Happy New Year!"

　　The New Year's Eve party began.

　　Some of the children wore pointed hats, and some decorated their headbands with "peace doves." They were extremely happy. The New Year's old man invited many distinguished guests for them: "Steel," "Coal," "Spindles," "Wheat," "Rice," "Cotton," "Corn," "Sweet Potatoes"... transformed by the counselors, to sing to them about the various miracles that appeared in the continued Great Leap Forward of the motherland in 1959: "1959 is the year of the Great Leap Forward, steel, iron, coal, and electricity all increase production, the general line is red all over the sky, the deeds of the Great Leap Forward are endless. Build factories, repair power stations, open coal mines, build ships, helicopters fly into the sky. The national workers are full of energy, chasing each other forward, one day equals twenty years, entering 1960 ahead of schedule..." The children clapped while listening.

　　It was time for the collective dance. The brisk dance music swirled in the brightly lit hall. The children all liked to dance with the guests transformed into "Wheat," "Corn," and "Sweet Potatoes." Deng Dadi, a ten-year-old child from Xibanqiao Primary School, squeezed in front of the "Wheat" guest and held the guest's hand tightly, saying, "I wish Uncle Wheat grows taller and bigger in 1960, bringing us more happiness." The wheat guest smiled kindly and congratulated Deng Dadi "Even greater progress in 1960!" (Attached picture)

　　新年前夕街头喜事多
　　本报记者
    这几天，北京大街小巷到处喜气洋洋。人们在欢庆1959年继续跃进的胜利中，迎接1960年的新跃进。
    一支报喜队
    新年前夕的一个中午，一阵锣鼓声传进了福绥境街道党委会。北京市街道生产红旗工厂——福绥境“七一”制帽加工厂党支部书记兼厂长杜英带领一群生产上的女将来了，她们高举着“七一制帽加工厂提前二十二天完成全年生产任务报喜队”的横标向党委报喜。
    这支报喜队由四十多个妇女代表组成的，她们很多人都是生产上的能手。一年多以前还是围着锅台转的家庭妇女卢成香，如今已经被评为红旗手啦。她在全厂大搞技术革命中，创造了用缝纫机做帽面的双手操作方法，从每天做三十个提高到二百个。卢成香的经验很快在全厂推广开来，她所领导的小组被评为先进小组。
    “七一”制帽加工厂是1958年大跃进中成立的。最初，只有十一个家庭妇女和三台缝纫机，现在已经发展成为一个有三百多人的工厂。整个工厂除了两名男工外，其他全部是家庭妇女。今年，他们共生产了九万多顶帽子，合格率达到99％以上，有些产品还远销国外。
    喜报到了家
    新年前两天，宣武区人民委员会民政科孙兴亚同志带着立功喜报来到西珠市口董鸿歧家中，一进门就兴奋地说：“董大娘，向你祝贺，铁道兵部队把你儿子的立功喜报寄来啦！”老大娘接过喜报看看艳红的大喜字，连声说：“好哇！”“好哇！”
    这个喜讯立刻传遍了街房四邻，范奶奶、姜婶子、陈四婶都跑来给董大娘贺喜。姜婶子说：“儿子鸿歧立了功，他妈妈乐到嘴都闭不上啦！”居民委员会副主任林莲芳也赶来了，她说：“董大娘真是福气，媳妇去年才出去工作，就评上了巧姑娘、优秀服务员，如今儿子又立了功，这真是全家光荣啊！”鸿歧的爱人陈凤英从正阳门旅馆赶回家，脸上堆满了笑容，她去年和鸿歧展开比赛进步的情景，又浮现在她的脑际。从那以后，鸿歧就不断来信，把自己经常受到上级表扬和下连当兵被评为五好战士的情况告诉她，陈凤英也把自己被评为巧姑娘、青年红旗手、优秀服务员的事迹写信告诉董鸿歧。现在她听说自己的爱人在年终评比时又获得记三等功的奖励，心里更有说不出的兴奋。
    家庭妇女练歌舞
    棉花上头条街道幼儿班保育员郭春华一手舞着扇子，一手摇着小铃当，同七位主妇一齐跳舞。她们一会儿扬起扇子，一会儿又舞动着手帕，边唱边舞，热闹非常。
    这些家庭妇女，在大跃进的1958年走出家庭，有的参加了街道工厂生产，有的当了保育员，有的在街道服务站工作。居民主任那菊英笑着对记者说：“别笑话我们，过去我们谁也没跳过舞，可是现在心里高兴，又赶上过新年，就想热闹热闹，还要参加区里的文艺会演呢。”
    舞蹈中，李秀荣表演得最好。那菊英说：“她当然演得好啦，有人给她当导演。”爱人在京剧三团乐队工作的李秀荣否认说：“谁给导演了？是我心里高兴，觉得参加工作有意义，所以才演得像的。”
    三面红旗万万岁
    少年宫少年厅舞台上的帷幕拉开了，在六百多名小朋友的面前，出现了布满繁星的天安门的夜空。容光焕发的新年老人在夜空下用宏亮的声音祝贺孩子们“新年好！”
    新年前夕的联欢晚会开始了。
    孩子们有的戴着尖顶高帽，有的在头篐上装饰着“和平鸽”，他们愉快极了。新年老人给他们请来了不少的贵宾：由辅导员们化装成的“钢”“煤”“纱锭”“小麦”“水稻”“棉花”“玉米”“白薯”……，给他们歌唱祖国在1959年的继续跃进里出现的各种奇迹：“1959年跃进年，钢、铁、煤、电样样都增产，总路线红遍了天，跃进的事迹说不完。盖工厂、修电站、开煤矿、造轮船，直升飞机飞上天。全国工人干劲足，你追我赶齐向前，一天等于二十年，提前跨进1960年……”小朋友们一边听一边鼓掌。
    跳集体舞了，轻快的舞曲在灯火辉煌的大厅里旋转缭绕。小朋友们都喜欢和化装成“小麦”、“玉米”、“白薯”等形象的客人们跳舞。西板桥小学一个十岁的名叫邓大地的孩子，挤到“小麦”客人的面前，紧紧地握着客人的手说：“祝小麦叔叔在1960年长的更高更大，带给我们更多的幸福。”小麦客人慈祥地笑着祝贺邓大地“1960年更加进步！”（附图片）
