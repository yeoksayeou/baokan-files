    Wuhan Manufactures Five-Meter Vertical Lathe

    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant recently successfully trial-produced a five-meter vertical lathe.

    This lathe weighs a total of 68 tons and can process workpieces with a diameter of five meters and weighing up to 35 tons. It is currently the largest vertical lathe produced in China. Its successful trial manufacture marks another step forward in China's machine tool manufacturing industry towards heavy-duty and large-scale production.

    This lathe was designed by the technical personnel of the design department of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant. After the drawings were designed, workers' opinions were widely solicited and revised to make the lathe structure more reasonable.

    武汉重型机床厂最近试制成功一台五米立式车床。
    这台车床总重六十八吨，可以加工直径五米、重达三十五吨的工件，是目前国内生产的最大的立式车床。它的试制成功，标志着我国机床制造业向重大型方面又迈进了一步。
    这台车床是武汉重型机床厂设计科技术人员设计的，图纸设计出来后，又广泛地征求了工人的意见作了修改，使车床结构更为合理。
