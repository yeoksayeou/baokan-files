Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 4th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published an editorial today calling on Japanese democratic forces to smash the enemy's conspiracies and prepare to launch a larger-scale ninth national unified action to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that since the Japanese people launched the eighth unified action, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party have wantonly slandered this great people's unified action, and have also instructed the police to suppress the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and other democratic organizations and their cadres.

The editorial pointed out that this despicable conspiracy is a serious insult to workers and people across the country. They are attempting to take the opportunity to fabricate "disturbance" incidents in order to formulate laws prohibiting demonstrations and rallies and to concentrate on defaming democratic forces.

The editorial emphasized that in response to this conspiracy and attack by the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, the Japanese working class and patriotic people must concentrate their forces, stand up bravely for their own reputation, for the interests and justice of the Japanese nation and people, further develop the patriotic struggle, and thoroughly pursue their traitorous and reactionary acts.

The editorial pointed out that we must organize the upcoming ninth national unified action into an even greater demonstration of the Japanese people against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and reactionary forces. To this end, preparations must begin immediately.

"Akahata" then pointed out the matters that should be paid attention to in the preparation process of the ninth unified action: not to succumb to the enemy's conspiracy, to expose the enemy's traitorous and reactionary acts to the masses, to consolidate the organization to counter the enemy; to strive for more people to participate in the front of democratic forces through individual actions and gatherings; to resolutely fight against anti-communist divisionism, to maintain and strengthen the united front; and to increase vigilance against Trotskyites and provocateurs, and to uphold the principle of unified action of the leadership and the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 3rd: The Japanese Socialist Party held a meeting this afternoon and decided to protest the police and prosecutor's office's search of the headquarters of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo).

The Socialist Party decided to demand that the government authorities immediately release the arrested persons and that the scope of arrests should not be expanded in the future.

The Japan National Relief Association issued a statement today protesting the government's suppression of students and workers who participated in the eighth national unified action, and expressed its determination to persist in the struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The statement pointed out that petitioning the Diet against the revision of the "Security Treaty" is the legitimate right of the people, and that revising the "Security Treaty" is fraught with the danger of dragging Japan into war again. The statement pointed out that the government and police's suppression of this legitimate right of the people is unconstitutional.

The statement also said that the Japan National Relief Association cannot allow the police to search trade unions. The statement also condemned the government's attempt to enact laws prohibiting the public from holding demonstrations around the Diet building. The statement demanded the immediate release of those arrested for participating in the demonstrations.

The "Osaka Prefectural Joint Struggle Conference for Preventing the Revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty," composed of the Socialist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), neutral trade unions, etc., issued a statement on the afternoon of the 2nd, saying that the government conducted illegal searches at the "Sohyo" headquarters and other places, and intends to arrest leading cadres. This is to divert the people's attention from issues such as the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the payment of war reparations to South Vietnam, and to attempt to formulate laws restricting demonstrations.

The Joint Struggle Conference also decided to carry out protest struggles on a larger scale than the eighth unified action in various departments on December 10. In addition, it will send a delegation of 200 representatives from the Kansai region's Joint Struggle Conference to the Diet on the 7th as a petition group to petition the Diet against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Japan Federation of Printing and Publishing Industry Workers' Unions issued a statement today protesting the government's suppression of people participating in demonstrations to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The statement said that workers participating in the National Federation of Printing and Publishing Industry Workers' Unions will mobilize forces in factories and workshops to participate in the ninth national unified action scheduled for December 10.

    日共“赤旗报”号召民主力量准备第九次统一行动
    奋勇进击岸政府的卖国反动行为
    日本社会党等抗议当局对人民群众横加镇压
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，召号日本民主力量粉碎敌人的阴谋，准备展开更大规模的阻止修改“安全条约”第九次全国统一行动。
    社论指出，自从日本人民展开第八次统一行动以来，岸信介内阁和自由民主党对这一伟大的人民的统一行动大肆进行诬蔑，还指使警察镇压日本工会总评议会等民主组织和它们的干部。
  社论指出，这种卑鄙的阴谋是对全国工人和人民的严重的侮辱。它们是企图趁机?造“扰乱”事件，来制定禁止示威游行的法律和集中诽谤民主力量。
    社论强调指出，针对岸信介内阁和自由民主党这种阴谋和进攻，日本工人阶级和爱国人民必须集中力量，为自己的声誉，为日本民族和人民的利益和正义，奋勇站起来，进一步发展爱国斗争，彻底追击它们的卖国反动行为。
    社论指出，我们要把即将到来的第九次全国统一行动组织成为日本人民对岸信介内阁和反动势力的更大的示威运动。为此，必须立即开始准备。
    “赤旗报”接着指出了在第九次统一行动准备过程中应该注意的事项：不屈服于敌人的阴谋，向群众揭露敌人的卖国反动行为，巩固反击敌人的组织；通过个别行动和集会等方式争取更广大的人民参加民主力量的战线；坚决同反共的分裂主义展开斗争，维护和加强统一战线；提高对托洛茨基分子和挑衅者的警惕，拥护领导机构和群众的团结一致的行动原则。
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天下午举行会议，决定抗议警察和检察当局搜查日本工会总评议会总部。
    社会党决定要求政府当局立即释放被捕的人，而且今后也不应该扩大逮捕的范围。
    日本国民救援会今天发表声明，抗议政府对参加第八次全国统一行动的学生和工人采取镇压措施，并且表示决心为阻止修改日美
  “安全条约”而坚持斗争。
    声明指出，向国会请愿，反对修改“安全条约”，是人民的正当权利，修改“安全条约”充满把日本再次卷入战争的危险。声明指出，政府和警察镇压人民的这种正当的权利是违反宪法的。
    声明还说，日本国民救援会不能容许警察搜查工会。声明还谴责政府企图制定禁止公众在国会大厦周围举行示威游行的法律。声明要求立即释放被逮捕的示威游行参加者。
    由社会党、日本工会总评议会，中立工会等组成的“阻止修改日美安全条约大阪府民共同斗争会议”，2日下午，发表声明说，政府在“总评”总部等处进行了非法的搜查，并且打算逮捕领导干部，这是为了转移人民对修改日美“安全条约”，向南越支付战争赔偿等问题的视线，并企图制订法律限制示威游行。
    共同斗争会议还决定，在12月10日要在各部门进行比第八次统一行动更大规模的抗议斗争。另外，还要在7日派遣关西地区共同斗争会议的代表二百人作为国会请愿团前往国会进行反对日美“安全条约”的请愿。
    日本全国印刷出版产业工会总联合会今天发表声明，抗议政府镇压参加阻止修改日美“安全条约”的示威游行的人们。
    声明说，参加全国印刷出版产业工会的工人将在工厂车间动员力量，参加预定在12月10日举行的第九次全国统一行动。
