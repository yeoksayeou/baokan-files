Thousands of red flags flutter on the dike,
    The water conservancy army displays its heroic spirit!
The secretary takes command at the front,
    The commune leader takes the lead in carrying earth.
Shovels and pickaxes dance, shaking mountains and rivers,
    Explosions of smoke and cannons rock heaven and earth,
Splitting open the earth's secret recesses, layer upon layer,
    Locking up the silver dragon in tens of thousands of streams.

    千杆红旗堤上飘千杆红旗堤上飘，水利大军逞英豪！书记阵前亲挂帅，社长带头把土挑。锹镐挥舞山河动，烟炮爆炸天地摇，劈开地窍千层土，锁住银龙万千条。
