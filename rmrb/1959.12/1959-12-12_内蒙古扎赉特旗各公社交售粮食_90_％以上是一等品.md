Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 10th: Zhalantun Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has completed its grain sales plan for this year ahead of schedule. All grain sold by the communes meets national quality standards, with first-class grain accounting for over 90%. Farmers throughout the banner have retained sufficient food rations and seeds.

The excellent results of this year's grain purchase work in Zhalantun Banner are a concrete manifestation of the immense superiority of the people's communes and the ever-increasing patriotic enthusiasm of the various ethnic groups of farmers. This year, the banner encountered drought, floods, insects, and hail, disasters not seen in thirty years, in the spring and summer seasons. However, the people's communes resolutely implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," put forward slogans such as "Protect all seedlings even without rain in spring" and "Seize grain from the mouths of insects," vigorously engaged in water conservancy and irrigation, and carried out mass insect catching and extermination activities, finally overcoming the natural disasters and achieving a bumper harvest. After the bumper harvest, the Erlongshan and Bayangaole People's Communes put forward specific targets, expressing their desire to sell more and better grain to the state; other communes formulated practical grain sales plans based on their actual grain production.

Subsequently, the people's communes launched a campaign to sell more and better grain. During the peak days of grain sales, the roads leading to the grain stations were bustling with activity and filled with people and vehicles. The Erlongshan People's Commune organized three waves of grain storage, completing the entire grain storage plan in just ten days.

    内蒙古扎赉特旗各公社交售粮食90％以上是一等品
    据新华社呼和浩特10日电　内蒙古自治区扎赉特旗提前完成了今年度交售粮食的计划。各公社交售的粮食全部合乎国家质量标准，其中一等粮占90％以上。全旗农民留有足够的口粮和种子。
    扎赉特旗今年粮食征购工作的良好成绩，是人民公社的巨大优越性和各族农民爱国热情日益高涨的具体表现。今年，全旗在春夏两季遇到三十年未有的旱、涝、虫、雹等灾害，但是，各人民公社坚决贯彻农业“八字宪法”，提出“一春无雨保全苗”、“从虫子嘴里夺粮”的口号，大搞水利灌溉，开展群众性的捕虫灭虫活动，终于战胜了天灾，获得丰收。在丰收以后，二龙山、巴彦高勒两个人民公社提出具体指标，表示要多卖粮、卖好粮给国家；其他各公社都根据本公社的粮食实际产量，订出切实的卖粮计划。
    接着，各人民公社便开展了一个多卖粮、卖好粮的运动。在卖粮高潮的日子里，通往收粮站的路上，到处人声鼎沸，车水马龙。二龙山人民公社组织了三次粮食入库高潮，仅用十天就完成了全部粮食入库计划。
