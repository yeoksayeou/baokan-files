　　Good Persistence!
　　Guo Jie
    Any revolutionary work often encounters this problem: how to persist? The so-called persistence, in terms of its meaning, is to firmly continue. In practical work, it is often the case that to advocate a new thing, or to implement an important measure, good persistence will inevitably lead to victory; poor persistence will inevitably lead to abandonment halfway.
    Schools running factories and students participating in labor are a revolution in China's education. Where persistence is good, the political life is unprecedentedly active, the teaching work is full of vitality, and the spiritual outlook of teachers and students is also completely new. Conversely, where persistence is not good, the changes are small and the progress is slow.
    Schools running factories are the product of last year's education revolution. Many universities and secondary schools have already proved in last year's practice that it is a good way to combine education with productive labor. This year, many schools have adhered to this policy and continue to develop and gradually improve it. The commendable achievements of secondary schools in Taiyuan City are an example.
    Today, this newspaper published news about Taiyuan City's secondary schools running factories, introducing their experiences. But what is more noteworthy is the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's enthusiastic and persevering spirit towards new things. Since last year, they have been adhering to the practice of schools running factories, and have promptly helped schools overcome various difficulties in their work, developing the temporary "hook-up" relationship between factories and schools into a fixed and regular cooperation system, creating a variety of forms, so that the factories of each school gradually developed from few to many, from small to large, from simple to perfect. They acted as promoters of new things in the education revolution.
    The fundamental key to whether a new work or a new system can be sustained is whether it can put politics in command. Is it a promoter or a conservative? Only in the face of new work and new systems can it be tested most concretely. Because new things are always imperfect when they first appear, and they are always unfamiliar to people, they will inevitably encounter various difficulties. In the face of difficulties, some people waver, and even negate the correctness of the policy; some people resolutely support the growth of new things. In this case, persistence or non-persistence is, in the final analysis, a reflection of old and new ideas in the face of new things. The responsibility of leaders lies in discovering contradictions, resolving contradictions, and unswervingly supporting and fostering the rapid growth of new things. In this regard, Taiyuan City's experience provides us with profound enlightenment. This year, when Taiyuan City rectified school factories and organized cooperation between factories and schools, it encountered many difficulties. Such as the lack of raw materials in the factory, insufficient equipment, difficulty in finding sales channels for products, weak technical strength... and so on. As a result, the thinking of some people began to waver, and they pushed back and forth, worrying about the new things. They said things like "schools running factories will affect the quality of teaching," "cooperation between factories and schools has no profit and will add a lot of trouble to the factory," and so on. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly criticized these erroneous ideas, unswervingly implemented the correct line and policy, and summarized the experience gained from actual struggles, found the direction and methods, boosted confidence, and overcame difficulties. The cooperation between factories and schools was incorporated into the city's large-scale cooperation of the national economy; the production of school factories was incorporated into the national economic plan; and the labor of students was incorporated into the teaching plan. It is not difficult to see that whether or not politics can be put in command is the watershed between all promoters and conservatives.
    The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China led the secondary schools to adhere to factory-school cooperation, adhere to schools running factories, and finally adhere to the implementation of the Party's education policy. In a word: they did it right! Good persistence!

　　坚持得好！
　　郭洁
    任何一件革命工作，都常常会遇到这样的问题：如何坚持下去？所谓坚持，就词意来说，是坚定地持续下去。在实际工作中，往往是这样的情况：要倡导一项新的事物，或者贯彻某项重要措施，坚持得好，结果必然是胜利；坚持得不好，结果必然是中途而废。
    学校兴办工厂，学生参加劳动，这是我国教育事业上的一场革命。哪里坚持得好，哪里的政治生活就空前活跃，教学工作就生气勃勃，师生的精神面貌也就焕然一新。反之，哪里坚持得不好，哪里的变化就不大，进步就不快。
    学校办工厂是去年教育革命的产物。不少高等学校和中等学校在去年的实践中就已经证实，它是教育结合生产劳动的好形式。今年，很多学校坚持了这一方针，并使之不断发展和逐渐完善，太原市各中等学校的可贵的成就，就是一个例子。
    今天本报发表了太原市中等学校办工厂的新闻，介绍了他们的经验。但是更值得注意的，还是中共太原市委对新事物满腔热情和坚韧不拔的坚持精神。他们从去年以来，就一直坚持学校办工厂的做法，并且及时地帮助各学校克服了工作中的种种困难，把原来厂校之间的临时“挂钩”联系，发展成为固定的、经常的协作制度，创造了多种多样的形式，使各学校的工厂由少到多、由小到大、由简陋到完善，逐步地发展起来。他们充当了教育革命运动中新事物的促进派。
    一件新的工作，一种新的制度，能不能坚持下去的根本关键，是能不能政治挂帅。是促进派？还是保守派？只有在新的工作、新的制度面前才能受到最具体的考验。因为新事物刚出现的时候，总是不完善的，也总是人们所不习惯的，必然要遇到这样那样的困难。在困难面前，有些人就动摇起来，甚至否定了方针的正确性；有些人却坚决地支持新事物成长。在这种情况下，坚持与不坚持，归根到底，是新旧思想在新事物面前的反映。领导者的责任，就是在于及时发现矛盾，解决矛盾，毫不动摇地支持和扶植新事物的迅速成长。在这一点上，太原市的经验给我们的启示是十分深刻的。今年太原市整顿学校工厂和组织厂校之间开展协作的时候，就曾遇到过不少困难。诸如工厂的原料缺乏、设备不足、产品找不到销路、技术力量薄弱……等等。于是就有一部分人的思想动摇起来了，他们左推右挡，对新事物忧心忡忡。说什么“学校办工厂会影响教学质量”，“工厂和学校协作没有油水，反会给工厂增添不少麻烦”等等。中共太原市委及时批判了这些错误的思想，坚定不移地贯彻了正确的方针路线，并把从实际斗争中摸索出来的经验，加以总结，找出了方向和办法，鼓足了信心，克服了困难。把厂校之间的协作纳入了全市国民经济的大协作中；把学校工厂的生产纳入了国民经济的计划；把学生的劳动纳入了教学计划。不难看出：能不能政治挂帅，是一切促进派和保守派之间的分水岭。
    中共太原市委领导各中等学校坚持了厂校协作，坚持了学校办厂，最后坚持贯彻了党的教育方针。一句话：他们做得对！坚持得好！
