The Xiangtan Electrical Machinery Plant in Hunan Province, taking the early completion of the production plan as the key, vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution around key production areas, effectively promoting the vigorous development of the increase production and practice economy campaign. From January to November 20th, the factory's employees put forward more than 24,000 innovation proposals targeting key production areas, implementing 20,500 of them, a twofold increase compared to the same period last year, saving over 180,000 work hours and over 900 tons of raw materials. The factory's production showed an all-round leap forward with higher output, better quality, and lower costs every ten days and every month. Now, the plant's completion of the annual plan is as follows: the total output value has been completed 0.06% ahead of schedule by thirty-four days; the output of fourteen major products such as AC generators and electric arc furnaces has been completed or over-completed twenty-one to two hundred and seventy days ahead of schedule; the key varieties stipulated by the state have all over-completed the plan; the overall labor productivity has been completed 0.13% ahead of schedule by one month; the cost reduction and profit delivery plans have also been completed ahead of schedule. Product quality has generally improved, and safety accidents have been greatly reduced.

The most fundamental reason for the vigorous development of the technical innovation movement in this factory is that the factory's Party committee summarized the experience of vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution last year, clarified the main attack direction, closely integrated innovation with current production, especially with the key production areas of a certain period, highlighted key points, and deepened step by step, making the innovation content more specific and continuously improving. In this way, technical innovation promoted the leap forward in production, and production in turn promoted the development of technical innovation. For example, at the beginning of this year, more than 500 pieces of equipment could not be ordered, some materials were not available, and the utilization rate of existing equipment was not high. Therefore, tapping production potential, simplifying product structure, and manufacturing simple equipment became the main direction of technical innovation at that time. In response to this key, the Party committee promptly proposed carrying out the "thousand-unit hour" high-efficiency movement. Through rational organization of labor and improved tools and equipment, 85% of the people in seventeen workshops reached the thousand-unit hour, and 90% reached high efficiency, greatly promoting production.

Taking the early completion of the production plan as the key, each workshop, section, and group, according to the characteristics of tasks, equipment, and technical conditions, some focused on changing heavy physical labor, some focused on trial-producing new products, some focused on solving variety and quality problems, and some focused on solving safety production problems, made plans, and adopted the method of mobilizing the masses to seize topics and encircle and annihilate key problems. In this way, the leadership's top-down assignment of plans and key tasks was closely combined with the bottom-up suggestion of key problems and seizing of topics, which not only exposed the problems more deeply, but also grasped the key points more accurately and solved them more thoroughly, ensuring the early completion of production tasks. For example, the machine repair workshop adopted the above method and found that to complete the August production plan, there were a total of thirty-three key problems of various sizes. The workshop immediately mobilized the masses, and more than eighty workers and engineers and technicians seized these topics. The workshop then organized these people to form innovation groups to solve key problems, and within a week, they put forward 226 innovation proposals, and key problems of various sizes were quickly broken through. For example, the wire mesh on the paint spraying equipment of the acetylene generating station used to require six people to complete in a month, but there was only one week at the time. After two days of research, the workers in this group improved the tools, turning manual operation into mechanized operation, increasing efficiency by fifteen times, and reducing it by five days compared to the required one week.

In the process of vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution to besiege key production areas, this factory generally adopted the method of "one person proposing, collective research, and dedicated person implementation," which had a great effect. In this way, not only was every innovation proposal studied and had results, making the innovation tools more perfect, but it also further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to vigorously carry out technical innovation. The reversing steel sheet on the traction machine of the traction workshop was originally milled one piece at a time with a manual fixture. Fu Wenxiang, a third-grade milling worker, proposed making a semi-automatic slot milling machine. After the workshop designated the section to conduct collective research, it was considered that this method was very good, and then designated Guo Ziming, a sixth-grade milling worker, Guo Kecheng, an engineer and technician, and him to conduct joint research. It was successfully trial-produced in less than a month, increasing efficiency by four times. Later, after the workers in the group conducted collective research, in addition to improving the original automatic feed and automatic unloading equipment, they also added automatic feeding equipment. The milled steel sheets were not only of excellent quality, but the efficiency was also increased by five times. This year, 70% of the more than 20,000 technical innovation proposals implemented by the factory were implemented using the above method.

    湘潭电机厂今年怎样实现了全面跃进？
    围绕生产关键狠狠革新技术
    本报讯　湖南省湘潭电机厂以提前完成生产计划为纲，围绕生产关键，大搞技术革新和技术革命，有力地推动了增产节约运动的蓬勃开展。从1月到11日20日，全厂职工就针对生产关键，提出革新建议二万四千多条，实现了二万零五百条，比去年同期增加两倍，节约工时十八万多小时，节约原材料九百多吨。全厂生产出现了一旬比一旬好、一月比一月强的高产优质低成本的全面跃进。现在，这个厂完成全年计划的情况是：总产值已经提前三十四天超额0.06％完成；交流发电机、电弧炼钢炉等十四种主要产品的产量，已提前二十一天至二百七十天完成或超额完成；国家规定的重点品种都超额完成了计划；全员劳动生产率已提前一个月超额0.13％完成计划；降低成本和上缴利润计划也已提前超额完成。产品质量普遍提高，安全事故大大减少。
    这个厂技术革新运动之所以蓬勃开展，最根本的原因是厂党委总结了去年大搞技术革新和技术革命的经验，明确主攻方向，将革新和当前生产紧密结合，特别是同一定时期的生产关键相结合，突出重点，步步深入，使革新内容更加具体，不断完善。这样，技术革新便推动了生产跃进，而生产又反过来促进了技术革新的开展。如今年初，有五百多台设备订不到货，部分材料没有来源，原有设备的利用率不高，因而挖掘生产潜力，简化产品结构，制造简易设备，就成了当时技术革新的主要方向。针对这个关键，党委及时提出开展“千台时”高工效运动，通过合理组织劳力和改进工具设备，十七个车间有85％的人达到了千台时，90％达到了高工效，大大地推动了生产。
    以提前完成生产计划为纲，各个车间、工段、小组根据任务、设备、技术条件等特点，有的以改变笨重的体力劳动为主，有的以试制新产品为主，有的以解决品种、质量问题为主，有的以解决安全生产问题为主，作出规划，并且采用发动群众抢课题的办法，围歼关键。这样，使领导自上而下交计划交关键与自下而上地提关键抢课题紧密结合起来，不但使问题暴露得更深，也使关键抓得更准，解决得更透，保证了生产任务的提前完成。如机修车间采用以上办法，发现要完成8月份生产计划，共有大小关键三十三个，车间立即发动群众，由八十多名工人和工程技术人员抢去了这些课题。车间接着就组织这些人组成破关键的革新小组，在一个星期内，就提出革新建议二百二十六件，大小关键迅速突破。如乙炔发生站刷漆设备上的铁丝网，要六个人做一个月才能完成，但是当时只有一个星期的时间，这个小组的工人经过两天的研究，改进工具，使手工操作变为机械化操作，提高工效十五倍，比要求的一个星期做一个还减少了五天。
    这个厂在大搞技术革新和技术革命围攻生产关键中，普遍采取“一人提出，集体研究，专人实现”的方法，效果很大。这样，不但革新建议件件有人研究，个个有结果，使革新的工具更完善，也进一步鼓舞了群众大搞技术革新的热情。牵引车间铣牵引器上的换向钢片，原来是手工夹具夹着一片片的铣，三级铣工符文祥提出制半自动的铣槽机。车间指定工段集体研究后，认为这个办法很好，便指定六级铣工郭自明、工程技术人员郭克成和他共同研究，不到一月便试制成功了，提高工效四倍。后来小组的工人集体研究后，除了改进原来的自动进刀、自动下料设备外，又增加了自动进料的设备，铣出的钢片不但质量优良，工效又提高了五倍。全厂今年所实现的二万多件技术革新建议，70％都是采用以上办法实现的。
