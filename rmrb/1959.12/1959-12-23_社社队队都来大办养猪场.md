Communes and Production Teams Should All Vigorously Run Pig Farms

The news from Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces regarding the great development of the pig-raising industry, published in today's paper, clearly shows that communes and production teams vigorously running pig farms is a decisive measure to ensure the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry.

In order to achieve high-speed development of the pig-raising industry, it is necessary to solve a series of specific problems such as funding, pig supply, feed, management, disease prevention, and so on. The better these problems are solved, the faster and better the pig-raising industry will develop. Implementing the principle of collective raising as the main method, supplemented by private raising, and having each commune and each production team vigorously run pig farms, is the key to quickly solving these problems and the key to high-speed development of the pig-raising industry. This year, Henan Province launched a mass pig-raising movement of "communes running ten-thousand-pig farms, production teams running thousand-pig farms, and production groups running hundred-pig farms." Although the movement has not been underway for long, counties such as Linru, Shangqiu, Ruyang, Songxian, Fugou, as well as Mengjin, Dancheng, and Qingfeng have already achieved "doubling in a hundred days," with the number of pigs increasing more than twofold. The total number of pigs in the province has also increased by 80% within half a year. In today's news from Jiangxi Province, the Shangrao Special District saw a twofold increase in the number of pigs in just two months due to vigorously running collective pig farms. From this, we can see the enormous power that communes and production teams running pig farms can unleash in the high-speed development of our pig-raising industry. Therefore, to develop our pig-raising industry at high speed, we must vigorously develop collective pig raising and, like Henan and Jiangxi, have all communes and production teams vigorously run pig farms. Of course, due to the different specific conditions in each region and the different levels of economic development in each people's commune, it is impossible to demand uniformity. However, it is possible to run pig farms of various sizes according to one's own conditions. Our country has more than 24,000 people's communes, which include about 700,000 production teams and millions of production groups. If all communes and production teams, except for those in ethnic minority areas where pig raising is prohibited, can have their own pig farms, our pig-raising industry will soon experience a great development.

Developing the collective pig-raising industry and having all communes and production teams vigorously run pig farms is of great significance for developing the commune economy and changing the face of poor teams. If a production team runs a thousand-pig farm, it can have an income of about 30,000 yuan per year; if a commune runs a three-thousand or five-thousand-pig farm, it can have an income of 80,000 to 150,000 yuan. Using this fund to develop the production of the commune and team can accomplish many things. This year, the collective pig farms at all levels in Wangyue Commune in Changsha County, Hunan Province, raised a total of more than 86,000 pigs. The commune-level pig farms alone increased their income by 480,000 yuan. They used this money to purchase three tractors, six water pumps, one universal pulverizer, one electric grinder, one electric blower, and a complete set of power generation equipment, as well as many other agricultural equipment. The commune increased its agricultural machinery by so much in one year, which will of course have a significant impact on the development of commune production, thereby further consolidating and improving the people's commune. Because developing pig raising has the characteristics of low investment, quick results, and high income, the commune's assistance to poor teams in developing pig raising is a very effective way to quickly change the face of poor teams and enable them to catch up with rich teams. Wangyue Commune in Changsha has a total of twenty-two production teams, fourteen of which have relatively backward production. This year, the commune has strengthened its leadership and support for these teams in a planned way, lending them 80,000 yuan, allocating feed to them, and supporting them with 1,000 sows and 2,000 piglets. As a result, with the strong support of the commune and their own efforts, these fourteen teams developed nearly 50,000 pigs in less than a year, an increase of 195% over last year; they sold 6,000 fattened pigs, more than double last year, and rapidly changed the backward face of the poor teams.

With the high-speed development of our socialist construction, the people's living standards are also improving accordingly. In order to further meet the growing needs of the broad masses of the people for meat, it is not only necessary to develop our pig-raising industry at high speed, but also to increase the commodity rate on the basis of the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry. And vigorously developing the collective pig-raising industry, and having all communes and production teams vigorously run collective pig farms, is a fundamental direction for increasing the commodity rate of pigs. Not only is the commodity rate of collective pig farms in production groups and public canteens much higher than that of pigs raised privately by members, but production teams and communes can also establish production bases specifically for producing commodity pigs. After Changsha County in Hunan Province vigorously developed collective pig raising, the number of pigs in stock not only increased by 65% compared to last year, but the commodity rate also increased by 40% compared to last year. At the same time, they also supported other areas with tens of thousands of piglets. After Henan Province launched the movement of communes and teams vigorously running pig farms, thirty-nine counties and cities, including Linru, Shangshui, and Xinyang, are gradually becoming commodity pig production bases for the entire province. It seems that the establishment of collective pig farms at all levels by the people's communes can not only solve the meat needs of the members, but also solve the state's need for commodity pigs, which is beneficial to the members, the commune, and the state. It is an important aspect of agriculture supporting industry and communes supporting cities. With a large number of commodity pigs in the hands of the state, they can be used to further meet the needs of urban and industrial populations, and pig by-products such as hides, bristles, bones, and offal can be used to develop daily-use industries and chemical industries, and can be organized for export to exchange for machinery, thereby accelerating the development of our industry and enabling industry to more powerfully support agriculture.

From the above simple analysis, it can be seen that whether from the perspective of developing the commune economy, changing the face of poor teams, consolidating and developing the people's commune, or from the perspective of supporting national construction, it is necessary to vigorously develop the collective pig-raising industry of the people's commune, and it is necessary for all communes and production teams to vigorously run pig farms.

Can people's communes, production teams, and even production groups or public canteens universally establish their own pig farms? Yes, and the conditions are very good.

Two consecutive years of bumper harvests in agriculture have provided a good material basis for the large-scale development of the pig-raising industry. In particular, the consolidated and sound development of the people's communes has created unparalleled superior conditions for the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry. The "large-scale and highly collectivized" people's communes have a large organizational scale, strong human and material resources, rich natural resources, and can reasonably use their human and material resources to develop the pig-raising industry. Before collectivization, although many agricultural cooperatives also wanted to develop the collective pig-raising industry, they were greatly limited due to the small scale and weak strength of the agricultural cooperatives. The collective pig-raising industry did not develop quickly, and not many pigs were raised. After collectivization, it was different. Many collective pig farms of the communes were built on a large scale, and the number of pigs also increased rapidly. The example of pig raising in Wangyue Commune in Changsha, Hunan, which we mentioned earlier, is one of many such facts. This commune started collective pig farms in 1957 before collectivization, but it only developed to eighty pigs in two years. This year, the commune invested 150,000 yuan and used 80,000 workdays to establish four large-scale pig farms with more than 1,000 pigs each, ninety-two medium-sized pig farms with more than 300 pigs each, and four hundred and eighty-seven small-scale pig farms with fewer than 300 pigs each. In the past month, it has established more than 100 more pig farms, and the number of pigs collectively raised by the entire commune has increased to more than 86,000 in one year. Communes and production teams have strong forces and can run pig farms on a large scale. Even those poor teams with relatively poor conditions can set up their own collective pig farms due to the unified arrangements and support of the commune. At the same time, because the people's commune is large in scale and has a large population, the people's commune can more easily plan funds, breed large numbers of piglets, and establish feed bases in a planned way according to the principle of unified leadership and overall arrangement. It can also transfer talents who have pig-raising experience and know how to treat pig diseases to work in the pig farms, so that the pigs can be fed better and stronger, and the pig farms can be run better and more. Now, people's communes, production teams, and even production groups and public canteens already have the conditions to run their own pig farms. With the development of production, the conditions will become better and better in the future. There is every reason to believe that the collective pig-raising industry can not only develop on a large scale, but also has infinite potential and a bright future.

Of course, when we advocate the large-scale development of collective pig raising and advocate that all communes and production teams vigorously run pig farms, it does not mean that private pig raising is not important or that it is not advocated. Private pig raising should still be advocated and developed. Our country is a large country with more than 500 million agricultural population. If 100 million farm households raise one pig each, that is 100 million pigs, which is a very large number, so we should also attach importance to and advocate family pig raising by members.

A mass pig-raising movement centered on the development of collective pig raising is being vigorously carried out in the vast rural areas of the country. Many advanced areas and advanced units with rapid development of the pig-raising industry, because they firmly grasped the fundamental link of communes and production teams vigorously running pig farms from the very beginning, the pig-raising industry has not only achieved an unprecedented high speed and achieved very gratifying achievements in their area, but also created many successful experiences in running collective pig farms. For example, when establishing pig farms, they follow the principle of diligence and frugality in running businesses, use simple and crude methods, and obtain materials locally, and build pig farms with very little money; in solving the problem of pig sources, Shanghai, Fujian, Zhejiang, Henan, Guangxi and other provinces and regions have created the experience of "keeping sows when found, selecting later" and establishing breeding pig farms; in terms of feed, many places have created the experience of mobilizing the broad masses of members to collect and store green and coarse feed in a concentrated manner and establishing professional teams to do a good job in feed base production; in terms of saving labor and combining pig raising with fertilizer accumulation and application, Changsha, Hunan and other places have created the experience of semi-mechanization of feed crushing, self-flowing water, and railization of swill transportation vehicles, and vigorously reforming feeding tools; Henan, Shanxi, Guangxi, and many other provinces and regions have created the experience of raising pigs in caves, building pig farms in fields, building feed bases near pig farms, and grazing on mountain slopes, using rainwater, channel self-flow irrigation, and automatic fertilization. This year alone, Luoyang Special District in Henan Province has established more than 2,000 field pig farms. These advanced experiences should be further promoted.

Communes and production teams vigorously running pig farms is the central link in the high-speed development of China's pig-raising industry. All people's communes and production teams already have the conditions to run pig farms on a large scale, and many advanced areas and advanced units with good development of the pig-raising industry have already created many successful experiences for us. As long as the party organizations and people's communes at all levels seriously grasp the collective pig-raising industry, equip strong cadres to be responsible for this work, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, boost greater enthusiasm, launch mass movements, and run pig farms on a large scale, the collective pig-raising industry will surely develop rapidly, and the number of pigs in our country will grow at high speed.

### 社社队队都来大办养猪场

　　社社队队都来大办养猪场
    从今天本报发表的浙江、江西两省养猪业大发展的新闻中可以清楚地看出：公社、生产队大办养猪场，是保证养猪业高速度发展的决定性的措施。
    为了使养猪业高速度的发展，需要解决资金、猪源、饲料、管理、防疫等等一系列的具体问题。这些问题解决得越好养猪业也就发展得越快、越好。贯彻执行以集体饲养为主、私养为辅的方针，每个公社、每个生产队都大办养猪场，是迅速解决这些问题的关键，也是高速度发展养猪业的关键。河南省今年开展了一个“社办万猪场、队办千猪场，生产小队办百猪场”的群众性的养猪运动。运动开展的时间虽然还不久，已经有临汝、商丘、汝阳、嵩县、扶沟以及孟津、郸城、清丰等县实现了“百日加番”，猪的头数增加了一倍以上。全省的猪也在半年之内增长80％。今天本报发表的江西省的消息中，上饶专区因为大办特办集体养猪场，猪的头数两个月就增长了两倍。从这里就可以看出社社队队办猪场在高速度发展我们的养猪事业中能够发挥出多么巨大的威力。因此，要高速度发展我们的养猪事业，便要大力发展集体养猪，便要像河南、江西等地区那样，社社队队大办养猪场。当然，由于各个地区的具体条件不同，各个人民公社的经济发展水平不同，不能要求一律。但是根据自己的条件，办各种规模不同的养猪场，却是可能的。我国共有两万四千多个人民公社，其中又包括有七十万个左右的生产队，几百万个生产小队，如果除了禁猪的兄弟民族地区以外的社社队队都能有自己的养猪场，我们的养猪业很快就可以出现一个大发展。
    发展集体养猪事业，社社队队大办养猪场对于发展公社经济，改变穷队面貌，具有重大的意义。一个生产队如果办起一个千头养猪场，每年就可以有三万元左右的收入；一个社办起一个三千头、五千头的养猪场，就可以有八、九万元至十四、五万元的收入。用这笔资金发展社、队的生产，可以办很多的事情。湖南省长沙县望岳公社的各级集体养猪场今年共养猪八万六千多头。仅公社一级的养猪场就增加了四十八万元收入。他们用这笔钱添置了三部拖拉机，六部抽水机，一部万能粉碎机，一部电动磨，一部电动鼓风机以及全套的发电设备和许多别的农业设备。一年之内，公社就增加了这样多的农业机器，当然会对于发展公社生产发生巨大的作用，从而进一步巩固和提高人民公社。正因为发展养猪具有投资少、见效快、收入大的特点，因此公社帮助穷队发展养猪事业，又是迅速改变穷队面貌，使穷队赶上富队的一个很有效的方法。长沙望岳公社共有二十二个生产队，有十四个队生产比较落后，今年公社有计划地加强了对这些队的领导和支援，贷给他们八万元，拨给他们饲料，又支援了他们一千头母猪和二千头小猪。结果，这十四个队在公社大力支援和自己的努力下，不到一年时间，猪就发展到近五万头，比去年增加195％；卖肥猪六千头，比去年增加一倍多，迅速地改变了穷队的落后面貌。
    随着我国社会主义建设事业的高速度发展，人民生活也在相应的提高着，为了进一步满足广大人民日益增长的对肉食的需要，不仅需要高速度地发展我国的养猪业，而且必须在养猪业高速发展的基础上提高商品率。而大力发展集体养猪事业，社社队队大办特办集体养猪场，正是提高猪的商品率的一个根本的方向。不仅生产小队、公共食堂的集体养猪场比社员私人养猪的商品率高得多，生产队和公社更可以建立专门生产商品猪的生产基地。湖南省长沙县大力发展集体养猪以后，猪的存栏数不仅比去年增加了65％，商品率也比去年提高了40％，同时还支援外地小猪十几万头。河南省开展社、队大办养猪场运动后，临汝、商水、信阳等三十九个县市正在逐步成为全省的商品猪生产基地。这样看来，人民公社建立各级集体养猪场，不仅可以解决社员的肉食问题，而且也可以解决国家对商品猪的需要问题，是对社员、公社、国家都有利的事情，是农业支援工业，公社支援城市的一个重要方面。国家手中有了大量的商品猪，就可以用来进一步满足城市和工业人口的需要，就可以用猪的副产品如皮、鬃、骨胳、内脏等发展日用工业和化学工业，就可以组织出口换取机器，从而加速我国工业的发展，使工业更有力地支援农业。
    从上面这个简单的分析中可以看出：不论是从发展公社经济、改变穷队面貌，巩固和发展人民公社看，还是从支援国家建设看，都需要大力发展人民公社的集体养猪事业，都需要社社队队大办特办养猪场。
    人民公社、生产队以至生产小队或公共食堂能不能普遍办起自己的养猪场呢？能，而且条件好得很。
    连续两年的农业大丰收，为大量发展养猪事业提供了很好的物质基础。特别是人民公社巩固地健全地发展，更为高速度发展养猪事业创造了无比优越的条件。“一大二公”的人民公社组织规模大，人力物力雄厚，有丰富的自然资源，而且能够合理地运用自己的人力物力来发展养猪事业。公社化以前，虽然有不少的农业社也曾想发展集体养猪事业，但终因农业社规模小、力量单薄，受到了很大限制，集体养猪业发展不快，猪也养得不多。公社化以后就不同了，许多公社的集体养猪场大量地兴建了起来，猪的头数也迅速地增加了起来。前面我们曾经谈到的湖南长沙望岳公社养猪的例子，就是这许许多多的事实中的一个。这个社在公社化以前的1957年就搞集体养猪场，但是，两年时间才发展到八十头猪。今年，公社投资十五万元，用八万个劳动日建立了四个千头以上的大型养猪场，九十二个三百头以上的中型养猪场，四百八十七个三百头以下的小型养猪场，近一个月来又建立了一百多个养猪场，全社集体饲养的猪的头数一年内就增加到八万六千多头。公社和生产队力量雄厚，可以大办特办养猪场，即便那些条件较差的穷队，由于有公社的统一安排和支援，也能搞起自己的集体养猪场。同时，由于人民公社规模大、人多，人民公社根据统一领导、全面安排的原则，可以比较容易地筹划资金，可以大量繁殖猪仔，可以有计划地建立饲料基地，可以把有养猪经验的、会治猪疫病的人才，调到养猪场来工作，这样就能把猪喂养得更好更壮，猪场就能办得更好更多。现在，人民公社、生产队以至生产小队、公共食堂都已经具备了举办自己的养猪场的条件。随着生产的发展，今后的条件会越来越好。完全有理由相信，集体养猪事业不仅能够大量发展，而且潜力无穷，前途无量。
    当然，我们提倡大量发展集体养猪，提倡社社队队大办养猪场，并不是说私人养猪就不重要了，就不提倡了。私人养猪还是要提倡要发展的。我国是一个有五亿多农业人口的大国，如果有一亿农户养猪一头，就是一亿头，这是一个很大的数目，所以也应该重视和提倡社员家庭养猪。
    一个以发展集体养猪为中心的群众性的养猪运动正在全国广大农村热烈开展起来，许多养猪业发展得快的先进地区、先进单位，由于一开始就紧紧抓住了社社队队大办养猪场这一根本环节，因而养猪业在他们那里不仅已经出现了空前未有的高速度，获得了十分可喜的成就，而且也创造了很多举办集体养猪场的成功的经验。比如在建立养猪场时根据勤俭办事业的方针，因陋就简、就地取材，只花很少的钱就把猪场建立起来；在解决猪源方面，上海、福建、浙江、河南、广西等省区创造了“见母就留，先留后选”和建立种猪场的经验；在饲料方面很多地方创造了发动广大社员突击收集贮存青粗饲料与建立专业队搞好饲料基地生产的经验；在节省劳动力和养猪与积肥用肥相结合方面，湖南长沙等地创造了饲料粉碎半机械化、用水自流化、运潲车轨化的大搞饲养工具改革的经验；河南、山西、广西以及很多别的省区创造了山洞养猪、田头建猪场、猪场附近建饲料基地以及山坡放牧、利用雨水、渠道自流灌溉、自动施肥的经验，仅河南省洛阳专区，今年就已建立起二千多个田头养猪场。这些先进经验应当进一步推广。
    社社队队大办养猪场是高速度发展我国养猪事业的中心环节。各个人民公社和生产队都已经具备了大办养猪场的条件，许多养猪业发展得好的先进地区和先进单位，又已经为我们创造了很多成功经验。各级党组织和人民公社，只要认真地把集体养猪事业抓起来，配备强有力的干部去负责这一工作，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，鼓起更大干劲，大搞群众运动，大办养猪场，集体养猪事业一定能够迅速地发展起来，我国的猪就能够高速度地增长。
