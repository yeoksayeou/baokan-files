Channel transport of timber in the Sichuan forest area is already famous throughout the country. In the past, timber felled in the forest area was transported to large rivers through small streams. These small streams meandered through the mountains, with narrow river surfaces, sharp bends, steep riverbeds, and many chaotic rocks and sandy beaches. In winter and spring, the water was low, and timber could not be floated.

After constructing fixed channels to divert the stream water, timber can be floated year-round. Taking western Sichuan as an example, the efficiency of transportation has increased by 72% compared to the past, and the cost has been reduced by 29.6%. This not only reduces labor intensity and ensures production safety but also avoids timber loss. The channels can also transport diseased and rotten timber, broad-leaved wood, bark, branches, and twigs discarded in the forest area, expanding the utilization of forest resources. The channel water can also be used for power generation and irrigation.

    渠道运材
    四川林区的渠道运材已经闻名全国。过去，林区采伐下来的木材，都是经过小溪流送到大河。这些小溪蜿蜒在万山之中，河面窄、弯度急、河身陡、乱石沙滩很多，冬春季节水小，木材无法流送。
    修了固定性的渠道，将溪水引进来，一年四季可以漂流木材，以川西为例，流送效率比过去提高72％，成本降低29.6％，既减轻了劳动强度，保证生产安全，又可以避免木材损失。渠道还能将丢弃在林区的病腐材、阔叶木、树皮、枝枒等运出来，扩大森林资源利用，也可利用渠水发电和灌溉。
