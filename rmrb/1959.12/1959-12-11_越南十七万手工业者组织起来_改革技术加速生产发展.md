Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Cable: According to the Vietnamese "People's Daily," the handicraft cooperation movement in North Vietnam has achieved great success. As of November, 170,000 handicraft workers have been organized. 1,500 handicraft cooperatives have been established in various parts of the North, including more than 47,700 members. Many handicraft cooperatives have set an example for individual handicraft workers in terms of technological reform, improving work efficiency, reducing costs, and improving the lives of their members. The leather-making cooperative in Thanh Hoa Province has manufactured a leather planing machine to replace manual operation, increasing work efficiency fivefold. The Kinh Co cooperative in Ninh Binh Province used to use four cubic meters of clay to make 10,000 bowls, but now it has been reduced to two and a half cubic meters. It has also improved its technology and added new product designs. The cooperative's income in October and November increased by 50% compared with last year. Because the members' awareness is constantly improving, and they are giving full play to their enthusiasm in production, many handicraft cooperatives have completed or overfulfilled their production plans on schedule.

    越南十七万手工业者组织起来
    改革技术加速生产发展
    据新华社河内电　据越南“人民报”报道，越南北方的手工业合作化运动取得了很大的成绩。截至11月止，已有十七万手工业者组织起来。在北方各地已经建立了一千五百个手工业合作社，包括社员四万七千七百多人。许多手工业合作社在技术改革、提高工作效率、降低成本、改善社员生活等方面为单干的手工业者树立了榜样。清化省制革合作社已经制成皮革刨床来代替手工操作，工作效率提高了五倍。宁平省泾哥合作社以前每做一万只碗要用四方粘土，现在减少到二个半土方。它还改进了技术，增添了产品花样。这个合作社10月和11月份的收入比去年增加50％。由于社员的觉悟不断提高，在生产中充分发挥了积极性，因此许多手工业合作社按期完成或提前完成生产计划。
