    How to Treat Piglet White Scours
    Qian Ju
    Now is the season for sows to give birth. Piglets are very susceptible to a disease called white scours a few days after birth. The main causes of this disease are failure to pay attention to the feeding and management of sows and piglets, and poor sanitation. For example, damp and cold pigsties; lack of exercise for piglets; feeding moldy feed, and so on.
    There are Western and Chinese medicine methods for treating piglet white scours. Here, I would like to introduce the following proven prescriptions for pig farms in various places to refer to:
    1.  Bai Long Powder (two parts *Pulsatilla chinensis*, one part *Gentiana*), three *qian* (old weight) per piglet each time, once a day, for two or three consecutive days. For severely ill or weak piglets, it can be combined with ginger and jujube decoction.
    2.  Garlic juice (mash fresh garlic and mix with twice the amount of warm water), twice a day, two *qian* each time.
    3.  Dysentery Powder (*Curcuma longa* one *qian*, one smoked plum, half a catty of dried persimmon, ground and mixed), mix with warm water and administer, twice a day, finishing the dose in two days.

    怎样治小猪白痢
  　钱局
    现在正是母猪产仔季节。仔猪生后几天，很容易得一种白痢病。致病原因主要是不注意母猪仔猪的饲养管理和清洁卫生。例如猪圈潮湿、寒冷；仔猪缺乏运动；喂给霉烂的饲料，等等。
    治疗仔猪白痢病的方法，有用西药的，有用中药的。我在这里介绍以下几个验方，供各地猪场参考：
    一、白龙散（白头翁二份，龙胆草一份），每头仔猪每次喂三钱（老秤），每天灌一次，连灌二、三天。重病或体弱的小猪，可配合生姜、大枣煎汁灌服。
    二、大蒜汁（用新鲜的大蒜捣烂，混合温水二倍）每天灌两次，每次二钱。
    三、止痢散（姜黄一钱，乌梅一个，柿饼半斤，研碎混合）调温水灌服，一天灌两次，两天灌完。
