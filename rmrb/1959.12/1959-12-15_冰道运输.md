    Ice Road Transportation
    In the expansion of the Bayi Reservoir in the Urumqi Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, the Bayi Farm vigorously promoted ice road transportation and the use of indigenous machinery. They completed a project originally scheduled for fifty days in only twenty days, reducing costs by more than half while maintaining engineering quality up to standard.

    The Bayi Reservoir irrigates 60,000 mu of farmland in the Bayi Farm. In the first few days of this year's expansion project, they encountered heavy snowfall and temperatures rapidly dropped to more than ten degrees below zero, which was very unfavorable for construction. However, the farm Party committee mobilized the workers to offer suggestions and turn unfavorable conditions into favorable ones. For projects with long distances and small slopes, they vigorously promoted ice transportation, and for projects with short distances and steep slopes, they used various types of indigenous machinery to transport earth. Taking advantage of the fact that the frozen soil layer in the reservoir was not yet very thick, they first impounded a small amount of water, forming a huge ice transportation route within the reservoir. They used wooden sleds to transport soil from higher elevations in the reservoir to the dam via the ice road. This method was efficient and lightweight, allowing each person to transport 9 to 10 cubic meters of soil per day.

    Throughout the construction site, in just over ten days, they also manufactured more than ten types of indigenous machinery, including automatic soil conveying belts, aerial cable soil transportation, turntable-type derricks, and wooden rail dump trucks, adding up to more than 600 pieces (units) together with ice transportation tools. Some of these indigenous machines used diesel engines as power, while others were manually operated. Work efficiency was increased by two to three times, or even up to ten times, compared to manual carrying.

    冰道运输
    新疆生产建设兵团乌鲁木齐垦区八一农场在扩建八一水库中，大搞冰道运输和土机械，只用二十天就完成了原计划五十天才能完成的工程，成本降低一半以上，工程质量合乎标准。
    八一水库灌溉着八一农场六万亩农田。今年扩建工程开工的头几天，就碰上下大雪，气温急速下降到零下十多度，对施工十分不利。但是农场党委发动职工出谋献策，变不利条件为有利条件，对距离远而坡度小的工程，就大搞冰上运输，距离近而坡度大的，就搞各种土机械运土。他们趁当时水库内冻土层还不很厚的时候，先蓄了一小部分水，使库内形成一个巨大的冰上运输道，用木爬犁通过冰道将水库内地势较高的土运到坝上。这种办法效率高，又轻便，每人每天可运土九至十立方米。
    全工地在十多天中，还制造出自动运土输送带、空中绳索运土、转盘式吊杆、木轨斗车等十多种土机械，加上冰上运输工具，共六百多件（部）。这些土机械有的用柴油机作动力，有的用人工操作，工效比人力挑运要提高两三倍到十几倍。
