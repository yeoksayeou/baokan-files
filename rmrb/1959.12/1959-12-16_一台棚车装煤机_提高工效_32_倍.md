A Coal Loading Machine for Boxcars Increases Efficiency by 32 Times

    The Ximing Mine of the Xishan Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province has developed a centrifugal coal loading machine for boxcars. It increases efficiency 32 times compared to manual coal loading, greatly accelerating the loading speed, reducing costs, and freeing the loading workers from heavy labor.

    In the past, loading boxcars involved inserting coal chutes through the windows, filling one window before moving to another, requiring four movements and four or five prying actions per boxcar. Simultaneously, four or five people had to level the coal inside the car, creating coal dust that affected workers' health. Now, using this mechanized loading method replaces all manual labor, saves labor for leveling the coal, and ensures the safety and health of workers.

    In the past, to accommodate the conditions of various mines, when the railway station delivered boxcars, they had to select vehicles based on the position of the boxcar window openings and the loading equipment of each mine, affecting vehicle turnover. Now, with this mechanized loading, the railway station no longer needs to select cars.

    This coal loading machine can also pile the coal at both ends of the car, avoiding blockage of the car doors, making it easier to open and close, and facilitating unloading.

    This coal loading machine is easy to manufacture, simple to operate, and versatile. It can be used not only for loading coal but also for loading bulk cargo such as ore and sand. (Chen Gengfu)

    一台棚车装煤机　提高工效32倍
    山西省西山矿务局西铭矿制成离心式棚车装煤机，比人工装煤车效率提高三十二倍，大大加快了装车速度，降低了成本，解除了装车工人的笨重劳动。
    过去装棚车，是从窗口将煤溜子插入，装满一个窗口再换一个窗口，每装一辆棚车要移动四次，撬车四、五次；同时还要四、五个人在车内平车，车内煤尘飞扬，影响工人健康。现在用这样机械装车，全部代替了体力劳动，并且节省了平车的劳力，保证了工人的安全和健康。
    过去为了适应各矿情况，车站送棚车时，必须根据棚车车窗开口位置及各矿装车设备，挑选车辆，影响了车辆周转。现在用这种机械装车，车站也不用挑车了。
    这种装煤机，还可以把煤分堆在车皮的两头，避免车门堵塞，便于开关，便于卸车。
    这种装煤机，制造容易，操作简单，用途广泛，不仅能用于装煤，也可用于装矿石、沙子等散装货物。　（陈耕夫）
