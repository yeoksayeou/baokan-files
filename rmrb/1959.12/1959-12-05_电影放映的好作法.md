    The heroes who attended the National Congress of Heroes are now "passing on their experiences" and "presenting their treasures" in various places, spreading advanced seeds, and joining with workers across the country to launch a movement of advanced collectives and advanced producers. More than a dozen of Beijing's top-tier cinemas are showing the documentary "Contemporary Heroes," produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, which captures the grand occasion of the National Congress of Heroes, as well as short films such as "Every Inch of Time is Gold," "Leap Forward New Song," and "Hold High the Red Flag and Leap Forward," which are timely complements to and promoters of the movement. At the same time, they are alternately re-screening in four or five top-tier cinemas feature films and documentary art films such as "County Party Secretary," "Land So Rich in Beauty," "Evergreen Tree," and "On the Xin'an River," which express the communist spirit of the people under the leadership of the Party, who dare to think and dare to act, and their fearless transformation of nature and struggle against difficulties in order to build a socialist motherland, in coordination with the vigorous movement to oppose right-leaning tendencies and encourage hard work in increasing production and practicing economy.
    This is a good practice that fully utilizes the art form of film, which has the widest mass appeal, and gives play to its role in actively cooperating with the current political movement in propaganda and mobilization. It is worthy of promotion and hopefully will attract the attention of film distribution departments in other regions.

    电影放映的好作法
    出席全国群英大会的英雄们现在正在各地“传经”“献宝”，撒布先进种子，和全国职工一道掀起了先进集体先进生产者运动。北京十几个甲级影院演出了中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制的全国群英会盛况的纪录片“当代英雄”，和“一寸光阴一寸金”、“跃进新歌”、“高举红旗大跃进”等短片，就是及时配合和促进运动的开展的。同时，轮流在四五个甲级影院复映，表现了人民在党的领导下敢想敢干的共产主义风格，为建设社会主义祖国，大无畏地改造自然，同困难作斗争的崇高精神的故事片和纪录性艺术片“县委书记”、“江山多娇”、“常青树”、“新安江上”等片，配合了反右倾、鼓干劲的轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。
    这是充分运用了电影这一群众性最广泛的艺术形式，发挥了它的积极配合当前政治运动的宣传鼓动作用的好作法，值得提倡，希望能引起其他各地电影发行部门的重视。
