　　The Tongjialiang Store in Kouquan District, Datong City, Shanxi Province, is now famous throughout the country. Tens of thousands of stores have put forward the slogan: Learn from Tongjialiang, catch up with Tongjialiang.
　　What to learn from Tongjialiang? Learning their service methods and items is one aspect. After the on-site meeting at Tongjialiang, many industrial, mining, and forestry area stores immediately increased supply points, adjusted business hours, and added service items... with immediate results and were very popular with the masses. It can be seen that service methods and service items should be learned.
　　However, learning from Tongjialiang cannot stop there. Stopping there is like only seeing the temple but not the Bodhisattva. The most important thing in learning from Tongjialiang is to learn the idea of ​​"everything for production, accelerating socialist construction" of the Tongjialiang store employees, and the spirit of serving production and serving the lives of employees wholeheartedly. By learning this kind of thinking and this kind of spirit, it is possible to study the needs of production and the lives of employees anytime and anywhere, do a good job in supply, create effective working methods according to local conditions, add service items, discover the shortcomings of one's own work, and strive for improvement in every possible way, and overcome various difficulties to make the supply work better and better.
　　Learning is for catching up, for surpassing, and for serving more outstandingly. The service methods and items of a store are limited; even if all the service methods and items of the Tongjialiang store are learned, it can only reach the existing level of the Tongjialiang store. However, things are developing forward, and the Tongjialiang store is also constantly advancing. If only limited methods and items are learned, it will be impossible to catch up, let alone surpass. To learn well, to catch up, and to surpass, it is even more necessary to focus on learning the thoughts and spirit of the employees of the Tongjialiang store. If everyone does this, the service quality of stores in industrial and mining areas across the country will rapidly improve, and every store will become a "Tongjialiang."

    山西大同市口泉区同家梁商店现在已经名扬全国。成千上万的商店提出了口号：学同家梁，赶同家梁。
    学同家梁的甚么？学习他们的服务方法和项目，这是一种。许多工矿林区商店在同家梁现场会议以后，立即增加了供应点，调整了营业时间，增加了服务项目，……立竿见影，很受群众欢迎。可见，服务方法、服务项目，应该学。
    可是，学同家梁，不能到此为止。到此为止，就好像只望见了庙宇，却没有看到菩萨。学同家梁，最重要的是学习同家梁商店职工“一切为了生产，加速社会主义建设”的思想，和全心全意为生产服务、为职工生活服务的精神。学到了这种思想、这种精神，就能够随时随地研究生产上和职工生活上的需要，做好供应工作，就能够因地制宜地创造有效的工作方法，增添服务项目，就能够发现自己工作不足之处，千方百计求得改进，也就能够克服各种困难，把供应工作越作越好。
    学是为了赶，为了超过，为了更出色地服务。一个商店的服务方法和项目，是有限的；把同家梁商店的服务方法和项目都学到了，也只能达到同家梁商店的现有水平。可是事情是向前发展的，同家梁商店也在不断地前进。只学了有限的方法和项目，就不会赶上，更难以超过。要学得好，要赶上，要超过，就更要着眼学习同家梁商店职工的思想和精神。大家都这样做，全国工矿区商店的服务质量就会迅速提高，每一个商店也就都会成为“同家梁”。
