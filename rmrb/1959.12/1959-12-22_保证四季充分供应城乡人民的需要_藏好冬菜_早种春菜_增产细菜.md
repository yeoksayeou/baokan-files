    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch – After victoriously completing the task of storing Chinese cabbage in cellars, the Party organizations of relevant people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing immediately adopted emergency measures. They organized the necessary labor force to urgently manage tasks such as turning the vegetables and ventilating during the storage period, in order to reduce losses, extend the storage period, and ensure the long-term and balanced supply of Chinese cabbage throughout this winter and next spring.
    This year, Beijing suburbs had a bumper harvest of Chinese cabbage. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the urban and rural people cooperated extensively, everyone pitched in, and every household stored cabbage. After more than half a month of round-the-clock harvesting, sun-drying, stripping, transporting, and placing in cellars, the storage work was fully completed by the end of November. In addition to the storage by government agencies, organizations, factories, mines, schools, citizens, and commercial departments, the people's communes in the suburbs stored a total of over 340 million jin of commercial Chinese cabbage. To prevent heat damage and rot during the initial storage period, each commune immediately began turning the cabbage after it was placed in the cellars. Currently, most areas have turned the cabbage three or four times, up to five or six times. Ventilation, frost prevention, and other management tasks have also been done meticulously. Generally, the storage is well-managed, without heat damage or freezing, and it is estimated that most of the cabbage can be stored until March or April of next year.
    To properly manage the cabbage stored in cellars, the Party committees of districts, counties, and people's communes in the suburbs have strengthened the leadership of storage management. They organized professional teams to manage the vegetables, properly arranged the labor force, and formulated management systems and storage measures. Chaoyang District implemented a five-level cellar chief system, with dedicated personnel responsible from the district, commune, brigade, production team, to the vegetable cellar. The entire district organized 644 professional teams specifically to manage tasks such as turning the cellar vegetables and ventilating. To promptly identify and resolve problems and correct shortcomings in storage management, the city, districts, and communes organized inspections and evaluations and widely launched competitions between communes, production teams, and vegetable cellars, promptly exchanging and promoting advanced leadership experiences and storage measures.
    The people's communes and production teams also mobilized commune members to formulate specific management technical measures. According to the characteristics of this year's cabbage—short sun-drying time after harvesting and high moisture content—the Sijiqing People's Commune mastered the method of frequently turning the cabbage and increasing ventilation to promptly dissipate the temperature and moisture in the batches of cabbage, thus reducing losses. This people's commune's control of the cellar temperature is: keep the cellar temperature consistently around 0 degrees Celsius. When the cellar temperature is above 0 degrees Celsius, open the skylights and air vents for ventilation; when the cellar temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius, cover the skylights to prevent frost. The nights are long in winter, so ventilation should be done two or three times at night to avoid heat damage to the cabbage.
    Currently, the Great Snow solar term has passed, and the severe cold season is approaching. The vegetable cellars of the people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing have prepared frost-prevention materials such as reed mats and straw so that when the severe cold arrives, they can promptly block the air vents according to the temperature drop to prevent the cabbage from freezing.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 21st - The various winter vegetables planted by communes in greenhouses and sunken beds in the suburbs of Beijing are thriving, and some have already begun to be harvested and marketed.
    To greatly meet the needs of the city's people for vegetables, the production of winter vegetables in the capital's suburbs has greatly developed this year. By the end of November, more than 13,000 greenhouses had been built, an increase of 23% over last winter, and 100,500 sunken beds had been dug, an increase of 60% over last year. Now, most of the greenhouses have begun production, and the first batch of seedlings has been basically planted, with the earliest planted tomatoes already flowering and bearing fruit. Most of the first crop of cucumbers has also been transplanted, and some have begun to bear fruit. Vegetables such as rapeseed, celery, and Chinese cabbage in the sunken beds have grown and are being gradually marketed.
    This year, not only the near suburbs have vigorously developed greenhouses and sunken beds, but also many communes in the far suburbs have overcome the difficulty of lacking technical expertise and built some new greenhouses and sunken beds. The Sijiqing Commune transferred a group of technical personnel to the Shijingshan, Yongfeng, and Mentougou communes to help them develop vegetable production. The communes actively used various substitutes to solve the problem of cold-proof and heat-preservation equipment. In greenhouse production, some communes and production teams tried every possible means to make full use of greenhouse space, adopting intercropping, relay cropping, and increasing the number of crops to increase the production of greenhouse fine vegetables.
    People's Daily, Tianjin, December 21st - The people's communes in the near suburbs of Tianjin, on the basis of a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables, are actively building greenhouses and sunken beds to expand winter fine vegetable production, ensuring that citizens can eat a variety of fresh vegetables in the cold winter. Currently, in addition to Chinese cabbage and radishes, there are also twenty or thirty kinds of fine vegetables such as tomatoes and peppers on the Tianjin market.
    The total output of autumn vegetables in the more than 200,000 mu of land in the near suburbs of Tianjin increased by about one time compared to the bumper year of 1957. Recently, the Municipal People's Committee held another meeting to arrange winter vegetable production, calling on the people's communes to win another victory in winter vegetable production on the basis of the bumper harvest of autumn vegetables and to develop in the direction of "guaranteeing quantity, variety, balanced supply, and four seasons of greenery." The vast numbers of cadres and commune members of the people's communes in the near suburbs actively responded to this call and threw themselves into the intense winter vegetable production. The people's communes immediately transferred labor to rush the construction of greenhouses and sunken beds when the rush to transport Chinese cabbage was nearing completion. According to incomplete statistics: the people's communes have built more than 13,000 greenhouses and more than 53,500 sunken beds and warm cellars, and have also cultivated more than 30,000 mu of overwintering vegetables on open land. The commune members expressed their determination to win the red flag in winter vegetable production. The cucumbers cultivated in the greenhouses of the Huidui Production Team in Hexi District were found to have downy mildew and powdery mildew. The commune members immediately sprayed medicine to eliminate the diseases and prevent their spread.
    This year, the people's communes in the near suburbs of Tianjin have brought into play the advantages of abundant funds and unified allocation of manpower, and the production of winter vegetables has increased greatly compared with last year. The Dabizhuang Production Team of the Xingdian Commune in Hebei District now has 140 greenhouses, an increase of 24% over last year, and 2,900 sunken beds and warm cellars, an increase of 35% over last year. In the advanced agricultural cooperative, the cooperative needed members to use dividends for investment in developing winter vegetable production. This year, thanks to the commune's great support in terms of manpower and materials, this year's production has been greatly developed, with income increasing by 26.7% compared to last year, and with the strength to take out 50,000 yuan to invest in winter vegetable production and build more greenhouses, sunken beds, and warm cellars.
    People's Daily, Chongqing, December 21st - The Huaxi People's Commune in the suburbs of Chongqing is actively arranging the early spring vegetable seedling cultivation. Currently, the entire commune has cultivated more than 13 million seedlings, with 14 varieties including melons, beans, and solanaceous fruits.
    In seedling cultivation, the commune adopted a system where secretaries at all levels took charge, organized seedling cultivation leadership groups, and established seedling cultivation professional teams in each management area and production team, implementing three guarantees (guarantee of work points, cost, and survival rate), four fixed (fixed personnel, quantity, quality, and seedling delivery time), and three awards (awards for exceeding targets, saving, and innovation), greatly giving play to the enthusiasm of the commune members. Now, the seedlings cultivated by the entire commune are growing well and are sufficient for the cultivation of 4,000 mu of vegetable land in early spring next year.
    The commune is focusing on the sowing of early spring vegetables. It is expected that the vegetables that will be marketed in March next year will be one and a half times more than in the same period this year, and in April will be three times more than in the same period this year.

　　藏好冬菜  早种春菜  增产细菜
　　北京加强贮藏管理，大力生产鲜菜供应城市
    天津积极建温室修阳畦，扩大冬季细菜生产
    重庆花溪公社安排早春蔬菜生产，早育菜苗
    本报讯　北京郊区各有关人民公社的党组织，在胜利完成大白菜入窖任务以后，立即采取紧急措施，组织必要的劳动力，抓紧贮藏期间的倒菜、放风等管理工作，以降低损耗，延长贮藏时期，保证今冬明春大白菜的长期均衡供应。
    今年北京郊区白菜大丰收。收获的十一亿斤大白菜，在各级党委的领导下，城乡人民大协作，人人动手，户户贮藏，经过半个多月的昼夜抢收、晾晒、撕菜、搬运、入窖，到11月下旬已全部完成了贮藏工作。除了机关、团体、厂矿、学校、市民和商业部门贮藏以外，郊区各人民公社共贮藏商品大白菜三亿四千多万斤。为了防止贮藏初期白菜伤热腐烂的损耗，在白菜入窖以后，各公社立即突击倒菜，目前大部地区已经倒菜三、四遍到五、六遍，放风、防寒等管理工作也都做得比较细致，一般保管较好，没有伤热和受冻，估计大部分可以贮存到明年3、4月份。
    为了把入窖的白菜保管好，郊区各区、县和人民公社党委都加强了贮藏管理的领导工作，组织保管菜的专业队伍，妥善安排了劳动力，制订了管理制度和贮藏措施。朝阳区实行了五级窖长制，从区、公社、大队、生产队到菜窖都有专人负责，全区共组织了六百四十四个专业队，专管窖菜的倒菜和放风等管理工作。为了及时发现和解决问题，纠正贮藏管理中的缺点，市、区、公社分别组织了检查评比，广泛开展了公社、生产队和菜窖之间的竞赛，及时交流推广了先进的领导经验和贮藏措施。
    各人民公社和生产队还发动社员制定了具体的管理技术措施。四季青人民公社根据今年白菜砍收后晾晒时间短、菜的水份大的特点，掌握了勤倒菜、多放风的办法，及时散发菜批中的温度和湿气，因此损耗较小。这个人民公社对菜窖温度的掌握是：窖温经常保持在摄氏零度左右。窖温在摄氏零度以上时，打开天窗和气眼放风换气；窖温降到摄氏零度以下时，再把天窗上盖苫防寒。冬天夜长，夜间也要放风两三次，以免白菜伤热。
    目前大雪节已过，严寒季节就要到来，北京郊区各人民公社的菜窖上都已准备好了防寒用的蒲苫、稻草，以便在严寒到来时，按照气温下降情况，及时堵好气眼，防止白菜受冻。
    新华社21日讯　北京市郊区各公社在温室和阳畦里种植的各种冬菜，欣欣向荣，有的已经开始收获上市。
    为了大力满足城市人民吃菜的需要，今年首都郊区的冬菜生产有很大发展。到11月底已修建温室一万三千多间，比去年冬季增加23％，打阳畦十万零五千畦，比去年增加60％。现在，大部分温室已开始生产，第一茬菜苗基本栽齐，其中栽得最早的西红柿已开花结果。头茬黄瓜也已大部分定植，一部分已经开始结瓜。阳畦中的油菜、芹菜、菜心等菜都已长成，正陆续上市。
    今年，不但近郊大力发展温室、阳畦，远郊许多公社也克服了技术力量缺乏的困难，新建了一部分温室、阳畦。四季青公社抽调了一批技术力量给石景山、永丰、门头沟等公社，帮助它们发展蔬菜生产。各公社都积极利用各种代用品解决了防寒保温的设备问题。在温室生产中，有些公社和生产队千方百计地充分利用了温室空间，采用间作、套种和增加茬次等办法增产温室细菜。
    本报天津21日电　天津市近郊各人民公社在秋菜获得丰收的基础上，积极建立温室阳畦，扩大冬季细菜生产，保证市民在寒冬能够吃到品种多样而又新鲜的蔬菜。目前，天津市场上除大白菜、萝卜等外，还有西红柿、辣椒等二三十种细菜。
    天津市近郊二十多万亩秋菜总产量，比丰收的1957年约增加一倍。最近市人民委员会又召开会议安排冬季蔬菜生产，号召各人民公社在秋菜丰收的基础上再在冬季蔬菜生产上打个胜仗，向“保证数量、品种多样、平　衡供应、四季常青”的方向发展。近郊各人民公社广大干部、社员，积极响应这一号召，投入了紧张的冬季蔬菜生产。各人民公社在抢运白菜将近结束的时候，立即抽调劳力突击建设温室阳畦。据不完全统计：各人民公社已建好温室一万三千多间，阳畦、暖窖五万三千五百多个，还在露地上栽培了三万多亩越冬蔬菜。社员们表示决心在冬季蔬菜生产中夺到红旗。河西区灰堆生产队温室栽培的黄瓜发现了霜霉病、白粉病，社员们立即喷药除治，不使蔓延发展。
    今年天津市近郊各人民公社发挥了资金雄厚、人力统一调配的优越性，冬季蔬菜生产比去年增加了很多。河北区兴淀公社大毕庄生产队，现有温室一百四十间，比去年增加24％，阳畦、暖窖两千九百个，比去年增加35％。高级农业社时，社里发展冬季蔬菜生产，需要社员用分红款作投资。今年由于公社在人力、物力方面给了他们很大支援，使今年的生产有了很大发展，收入比去年增加了26.7％，有力量拿出五万元投资冬季蔬菜生产，兴建更多的温室、阳畦、暖窖。
    本报重庆21日电　重庆市郊花溪人民公社，积极安排早春蔬菜育苗工作。目前全社已培育菜苗一千三百多万株，有瓜类、豆类、茄果类等十四个品种。
    在育苗中，公社采取层层书记挂帅，组织育苗领导小组，各个管理区和生产队都建立了育苗专业队，实行三包（包工分、成本、成活率），四定（定人员、数量、质量、育苗交苗时间），三奖（奖励超额完成任务、节约、创造发明）办法，大大发挥了社员的积极性。现在全社所培育的菜苗生长良好，已足够明年早春四千亩蔬菜地的栽培。
    这个公社大抓早春蔬菜的播种，预计明年3月份上市的蔬菜将比今年同期多一倍半，4月份将比今年同期增加三倍。（附图片）
