Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, December 18th: U.S. President Eisenhower visited Tunisia for just over three hours on the morning of the 17th, arriving on the cruiser "Des Moines." He held a secret meeting with Tunisian President Bourguiba for an hour and a half. He continued by warship to France that afternoon. A joint communique issued by Eisenhower and Bourguiba stated that they "studied the situation created by the difficulties in Algeria." The communique also stated that "the talks between the two presidents achieved a broad understanding on the various issues discussed."

According to Agence France-Presse, the focus of the talks was the Algerian question. Eisenhower's spokesman, Hagerty, said on the "Des Moines" in response to reporters' questions: Eisenhower and Bourguiba both agree with the "self-determination" proposal for Algeria put forward by French President de Gaulle, which is well known.

The communique also mentioned "the need for more developed industrial countries to increase support for countries in the process of economic development." Western news agencies interpreted this to mean that Eisenhower gave Bourguiba "assurance" on the issue of increasing "aid" to Tunisia.

    艾森豪威尔访问突尼斯
    新华社18日讯　突尼斯消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔17日上午乘巡洋舰“得梅因号”到突尼斯进行了三小时多的访问。他同突尼斯总统布尔吉巴举行了一个半小时的秘密会谈。当天下午他继续乘军舰去法国。艾森豪威尔和布尔吉巴发表的会谈公报说，他们“研究了由于阿尔及利亚的困难所产生的局势”。公报还说，“两国总统的会谈使他们在所讨论的各项问题上取得了广泛的谅解”。
    据法新社报道，这次会谈的中心是阿尔及利亚问题。艾森豪威尔的发言人哈格蒂在“得梅因号”上答记者问时说：艾森豪威尔和布尔吉巴都赞成法国总统戴高乐提出的阿尔及利亚的“自决”的建议，这是众所周知的。
    公报中还提到，“需要工业较发达的国家增加对在发展经济过程中的国家的支持”。据西方通讯社解释说，这指的就是艾森豪威尔在对增加突尼斯的“援助”问题上给了布尔吉巴“保证”。
