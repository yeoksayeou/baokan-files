Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 25th: Liaoning Province completed its annual industrial output value plan twenty-seven days ahead of schedule. As of December 20th, the province's completed industrial output value has exceeded the annual plan by 5.6%.

Liaoning Province's industrial production achieved continued leaps forward this year on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year. Over the past year, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," industrial enterprises throughout the province have consistently adhered to putting politics in command and letting ideology lead the way. Whether they were modern large-scale enterprises or small and medium-sized enterprises, they fully utilized the revolutionary zeal of the workers and masses, and continuously improved the level of enterprise management, thereby ensuring the comprehensive leap forward of industrial production throughout the province. Since November, good news of early completion of annual plans has been continuously pouring in from various industrial and mining enterprises across the province, and batches of factories have gloriously stepped into 1960. According to statistics, products such as steel, steel materials, coal, machinery, gasoline, diesel, cement, chemical fertilizers, rubber tires, cotton yarn, and burlap bags, which are included in the state plan, have all completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. According to statistics up to the end of November, the total output value of the province's machinery industry increased by 35.3% compared with the same period last year.

This year, the industrial production sector of Liaoning Province undertook even more arduous tasks than last year. In order to give full play to the role of the industrial base and support the construction of industrial and agricultural production across the country, from the beginning of the year, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee has widely and deeply carried out ideological education on the idea of "the whole country as a chessboard" in enterprises throughout the province, and organized all walks of life into a close production collaboration network, distinguishing between priorities and emergencies, so that everyone supports each other when one has difficulties. As a result, a situation of industries soaring together and large and small factories leaping forward comprehensively appeared throughout the province, gloriously completing the task of supporting industrial and agricultural production across the country.

This year, the province's workers not only produced more important materials such as steel, iron, and raw coal for the country than last year, but also created a large number of new machinery and equipment to support various regions. Among them are the rolling mill with a roll diameter of 800 mm and the 2,000-ton hydraulic press manufactured by the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, the giant double-suction single-stage horizontal centrifugal water pump with a drainage capacity of 10,000 tons per hour manufactured by the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, the 330,000-volt large-scale voltage transformer manufactured by the Shenyang Voltage Transformer Factory, as well as other various modern equipment, fertilizer equipment, mining equipment, irrigation and drainage equipment, etc.

The socialist labor competition in the form of technical performance competitions is a new development in the mass movement vigorously carried out by modern enterprises in Liaoning Province this year. After the experience of the technical performance competition created by the workers of the Third Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel was promoted throughout the province, a vigorous competition situation of everyone performing and performing everywhere quickly emerged in various enterprises. The in-depth development of technical performance competitions throughout the province greatly improved the labor productivity of workers and led to a high-speed development of production. This played a significant role in ensuring the early completion of this year's state plan.

　　一盘棋思想深入人心　生产协作网撒布全省
    辽宁完成支援全国的重任
    新华社沈阳25日电　辽宁省提前二十七天完成了今年工业总产值计划。到12月20日止，全省完成的工业总产值已经超过年计划5.6％。
    辽宁省今年工业生产，在去年大跃进的基础上实现了继续跃进。一年来，全省工业企业在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，始终坚持政治挂帅，思想先行。无论是现代化大型企业或中小企业，都充分发挥了职工群众的革命干劲，企业管理水平不断提高，从而保证了全省工业生产的全面跃进。从11月份以来，全省各工矿企业就不断传出提前完成全年计划的捷报，成批的工厂先后光荣地跨进1960年。据统计，全省列入国家计划的钢、钢材、煤炭、机械、汽油、柴油、水泥、化学肥料、橡胶轮胎、棉纱、麻袋等产品，都已经提前完成了全年计划。到11月底统计，全省机械工业总产值就比去年同期增长了35.3％。
    辽宁省工业生产部门今年担负了比去年更加繁重的任务。为了充分发挥工业基地的作用，支援全国工农业生产建设，从年初开始，中共辽宁省委就在全省企业中广泛深入地进行了全国一盘棋的思想教育，并且分别轻重缓急把各行各业组织成一个严密的生产协作网，做到了一家有困难大家齐支援，因此在全省范围内出现了各行各业比翼齐飞、大小工厂全面跃进的局面。光荣地完成了支援全国工农业生产的任务。
    全省职工今年不仅为国家生产了比去年更多的钢、铁、原煤等重要物资，而且创造了大批新的机械设备支援了各地。其中有沈阳重型机器厂制造的轧辊直径八百毫米的轧钢机和二千吨水压机，有沈阳水泵厂制造的每小时可排水一万吨的巨型双吸单级卧式离心水泵，有沈阳电压器厂制造的三十三万伏大型电压器，以及其他各种现代设备、化肥设备、矿山设备、排灌设备等。
    以技术表演赛为主要形式的社会主义劳动竞赛，是今年辽宁省现代化企业大搞群众运动的一个新发展。鞍钢第三炼钢厂职工创造的技术表演赛经验在全省推广后，各地企业很快就掀起了人人表演处处表演的轰轰烈烈的竞赛局面。全省技术表演赛的深入开展，大大提高了职工的劳动生产率，出现了生产的高速度发展。这对保证提前完成今年国家计划起了重大作用。
