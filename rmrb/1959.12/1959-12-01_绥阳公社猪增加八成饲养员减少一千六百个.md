    Suiyang Commune Increases Pigs by 80%, Reduces Herdsmen by 1,600
    (Our dispatch) Guiyang Province, Meitan County, Suiyang People's Commune's 147 pig farms, due to the reform of seven pig feeding technologies, increased the number of pigs fed by each herdsman from the original 15 to 41, with the most reaching 100.
    Recently, the production of live pigs has increased sharply in Suiyang Commune. The labor spent on pig raising accounts for 15.8% of the total labor force of the commune, and the herdsmen still feel overwhelmed. In order to ensure the overall development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, the commune party committee mobilized commune members and herdsmen to vigorously carry out technological innovations in pig feeding and improve feeding management. In the past few months, more than 140 pig farms in the commune have generally made six reforms: 1. Changing small pen scattered feeding to large pen centralized feeding. Originally, the 147 pig farms in the commune had a total of 4,040 pig houses. When feeding in scattered pens, a 100-pig farm needed one strong laborer to feed the pigs every day. After changing to appropriately centralized feeding, manpower was greatly saved. 2. Changing manual water carrying to gravity-fed water. More than 100 pig farms use bamboo tubes to draw water by gravity to raise pigs, saving one laborer for every 150 pigs. 3. Changing manual chopping of pig grass to chaff cutter chopping of pig grass. 125 pig farms in the commune have already used chaff cutters. Each chaff cutter can chop 8,000 catties of pig grass a day, increasing efficiency by nine times compared to manual chopping. 4. Changing manual carrying of feed to transporting feed with local trains or handcarts. The commune has used 104 local trains and handcarts, and eleven sliding wireways. A local train can carry more than 500 catties at a time, which can feed 25 pigs, increasing efficiency by five times compared to manual transportation. 5. Changing small pot single stove cooking to large pot joint stove cooking. Before the stove was reformed, one person managed three small pots and could only cook more than 700 catties a day; after using a large pot joint stove, each person can cook 10,000 catties of feed per day, increasing efficiency by 13 times and greatly saving fuel. 6. Combining pen feeding with outdoor grazing. Each pig farm grazes pigs for two to four hours every day, which can save labor for collecting and processing feed.
    After this series of reforms, the number of pigs in the commune increased by 83% compared to February this year, but the number of herdsmen decreased from more than 3,800 to 2,200.

    绥阳公社猪增加八成饲养员减少一千六百个
    本报讯　贵州省湄潭县绥阳人民公社一百四十七个养猪场，由于改革了七项喂猪技术，每个饲养员喂猪数由原来的十五头增加到四十一头，最多的达一百头。
    绥阳公社最近生猪生产急剧增长，花费在养猪方面的劳动力占全社总劳动力的15.8％，饲养员们还是感到忙不过来。为了保证农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，公社党委发动社员和饲养员，大搞喂猪技术革新和改进饲养管理。几个月来，公社一百四十多个养猪场普遍作了六项改革：一、改小圈分散饲养为大圈集中饲养。原来全社一百四十七个养猪场共建立四千零四十间猪舍，就圈分散饲养时，一个百头的养猪场，每天要一个强劳力喂猪。改为适当集中饲养后，大大节约了人力。二、改人挑水为引水自流。有一百多个养猪场，用竹筒引水自流养猪，每一百五十头猪就节省一个劳力。三、改人工砍猪草为铡草机切猪草。全社已有一百二十五个养猪场使用了铡草机，每部铡草机一人一天能铡猪草八千斤，比人工砍猪草提高工效九倍。四、改人挑饲料为土火车或人力车运饲料。全社已使用土火车和鸡公车一百零四部，滑丝十一处。用土火车一次就运五百多斤，可喂二十五头猪，比人力运料提高工效五倍。五、改小锅独灶煮料为大锅联灶煮料。未改灶前一人管三个小锅，一天只能煮七百多斤；改用大锅联灶后，每天每人可煮饲料一万斤，提高工效十三倍，并且大大节约了燃料。六、改圈内饲养与圈外放牧相结合。各猪场每天放牧猪二至四小时，可节省采集和加工饲料的劳力。
    经过这一系列改革，全社的猪比今年2月增加了83％，饲养员却由三千八百多人减至二千二百人。
