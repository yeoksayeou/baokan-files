Experience in Close Planting of Late Rice
Guangdong Provincial Party Committee Agriculture Office

Editor's Note: During the autumn harvest, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee organized a 'Late Rice High-Yield Experience Summary Working Group' to go to six special districts, twenty-four counties and cities, and forty-nine communes throughout the province. They measured and harvested nearly one hundred plots of land, summarizing in seven aspects: close planting, deep plowing, selection of fine varieties, cultivation of strong seedlings, early planting, fertilization and irrigation techniques, and transformation of backward fields. These experiences will play a significant role in striving for greater agricultural harvests next year. We published a news item about this on November 17th. Now, we are extracting and publishing a section on rational close planting from their summary for reference in various localities.

Rational close planting is the core of agricultural yield-increasing technical measures. This year, the average number of effective ears per mu of late rice in Guangdong Province was 200,000 to 220,000 ears, but the number of ears in high-yield counties, high-yield areas, or fields with large yield increases was higher than this average. According to the results of this actual harvesting and measurement, high-yield fields yielding over 1,000 jin generally had about 250,000 to 300,000 effective ears. This shows that to achieve high yields under the current conditions, it is necessary to appropriately increase the number of ears. Some people believe that increasing the number of ears will relatively reduce the number of grains, and therefore they are not actively promoting close planting. Facts have proven that this view is incorrect. In Xichang Commune, Jieyang County, which has a high level of rice management, one field had an average of 320,000 effective ears per mu, with an average of 103 grains per ear. This shows that within a certain limit, as long as the management is good, it is entirely possible to achieve a large number of ears without reducing the number of grains. We also focused on studying the reasonable limit of close planting this time. According to the survey of thirty-six late rice fields harvested this time, the seven fields yielding over 1,000 jin had an average of 297,000 effective ears per mu, with an average of 77 grains per ear (full grains, the same below); the eleven fields yielding 800 to 1,000 jin had an average of 232,000 ears per mu, with an average of 82 grains per ear; the thirteen fields yielding 600 to 800 jin had an average of 225,000 ears per mu, with an average of 68 grains per ear; and the five fields yielding less than 600 jin had an average of 205,000 ears per mu, with an average of 51 grains per ear. It can be seen that to achieve a large-scale yield of 1,000 jin per mu in one season, the final number of effective ears per mu should strive to reach about 300,000.

According to the experience of high-yield fields, to achieve 300,000 ears per mu, corresponding rational close planting specifications must be adopted. Planting specifications are closely related to planting density. The denser the planting, the more attention should be paid to specifications. We have seen many situations like this: with the same soil quality, variety, and management conditions, planting the same number of seedlings, the resulting number of effective ears showed relatively significant differences due to different planting specifications. Therefore, planting specifications are largely the main method to ensure a certain number of ears and ventilation and light transmission. From the high-yield experience of late rice, it can be seen that to achieve 300,000 ears, it is generally better to adopt close planting specifications of 3×5 (cun, the same below), 3×6, 3×7, and 4×5 for plant spacing and row spacing. In the Chaoshan Plain, where the management level is high and the tillering rate is high, and in other areas where labor is scarce and the season is tight, 4×6 and 5×6 specifications can also be used.

As for relying on the main ear or relying on tillers? The results of our investigation are that this depends on the specific conditions and cannot be generalized. For example, in the Chaoshan area, this year's late rice has achieved great success in relying on tillers to achieve the planned number of ears. Generally, they can tiller more than double the number of effective ears, and the tillering ears are also relatively uniform. This is mainly due to their relatively fertile land, planting of old and strong seedlings, earlier planting, higher management level in irrigation and fertilization, and the strong tillering ability of rice varieties. Although the average number of ears per mu of their late rice this year is still not enough (about 220,000 ears), it is possible to rely on tillering to reach more than 300,000 ears with an appropriate increase in the number of seedlings. However, in other areas, especially some areas where the soil is not very fertile and the management level is not high, it is still impossible to rely on tillering to achieve the planned number of ears. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the main ear and also need a certain number of tillers. The number of seedlings planted per hill can be determined according to the management level and different soil, fertilizer, and other conditions. In the Chaoshan area, it can be less, such as five to eight seedlings, while in other areas, it should be more, such as eight to ten seedlings. In areas with less labor and a tight season, in order not to miss the farming season, the row spacing can be widened, and the number of seedlings per hill can be increased further.

    晚稻密植经验
    广东省委农业办公室
    编者注：在秋收期间，广东省委组织了一个‘晚稻高产经验总结工作团’，到全省六个专区、二十四个县市、四十九个公社，实测实刈了将近一百块田，就密植、深耕、选用良种、培育壮秧、早插、施肥和排灌技术、改造落后田七个方面进行了总结。这些经验对明年争取农业更大丰收将会发生重大作用。11月17日我们曾就这件事发过消息，现在从他们的总结中摘出合理密植一段发表，供各地参考。
    合理密植是农业增产技术措施的中心。今年广东省的晚稻每亩平均有效穗为二十万到二十二万穗，但高产县、高产片、或增产幅度大的田，穗数都高出这个平均数。从这次实刈实测的结果看来，千斤以上的丰产田，一般有效穗数都在二十五万穗至三十万穗左右。这就表明，在目前条件下要高产就必须适当增加穗数。有些人认为，穗数增加，粒数会相对减少，因而不积极推行密植。事实证明这种看法是不正确的。在水稻管理水平较高的揭阳县锡场公社，有一块田每亩平均有效穗数三十二万穗，每穗的粒数平均达到一百零三粒。这就说明，在一定限度内只要管得好，完全可以做到穗多而粒不减少。我们这次也着重研究了密植的合理限度。据这次实刈的三十六块晚稻田的调查，一千斤以上的七块，每亩平均有效穗数二十九点七万穗，每穗平均七十七粒（充实粒，下同）；八百到一千斤的有十一块，每亩平均二十三点二万穗，每穗平均八十二粒；六百到八百斤的有十三块，每亩平均二十二点五万穗，每穗平均六十八粒；六百斤以下的有五块，每亩平均二十点五万穗，每穗平均五十一粒。可以看出，要大面积一造亩产千斤，每亩的最后有效穗数应争取达到三十万穗左右。
    根据高产田的经验，每亩要达到三十万穗，就必须采取相应的合理密植规格。插植规格与插植密度有很大关系，越密就越要讲究规格。我们看到不少这样的情况，同样土质、品种和管理条件，插下同等苗数，由于插植规格不同，结果有效穗数也出现了比较显著的差异。因此，插植规格在很大程度上是保证有一定的穗数和通风透光的主要方法。我们从晚稻的丰产经验中看出，要达到三十万穗，一般地采取株行距3×5（寸，下同）、3×6、3×7、4×5的密植规格比较好。管理水平高、分蘖率大的潮汕平原和劳力少季节紧的其他地区，插4×6、5×6的规格也可以。
    至于依靠主穗还是依靠分蘖？我们调查的结果是，这要看具体条件，不能一概而论。如潮汕地区，今年晚稻在依靠分蘖来达到计划穗数方面是取得了很大成绩的，一般都能分蘖出一倍以上的有效穗数，而且分蘖穗也比较整齐，这主要是由于他们那里土地比较肥沃、插老壮秧、插秧较早、排灌施肥等管理水平较高、水稻品种的分蘖力比较强等等。他们今年晚稻每亩的平均穗数虽然还不够多（约二十二万穗左右），但在适当增加一些苗数的情况下，依靠分蘖来达到三十万穗以上是可以做到的。但是，在其他地区，特别是一些土壤不很肥沃、管理水平还不高的地区，目前依靠分蘖来达到计划穗数还是不行的，因此就需要依靠主穗，也需要有一定数量的分蘖。每科插植苗数，可以根据管理水平及不同的土壤、肥料等条件而定。在潮汕地区可以少些，如五至八苗，其他地区则应多些，如八至十苗。劳力少、季节紧的地区，为了不误农时，行距还可放宽一些，每科的苗数可再多些。
