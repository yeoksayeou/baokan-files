　　On the Theatrical Stage
    Rich Henan Flavor Quju Opera

    The Zhengzhou City Quju Opera Troupe from Henan Province is making its first visit to Beijing, bringing "Gan Jiao" (Catching Up), "Xia Xiang" (Going to the Countryside), "Chao Yang Gou" (Facing the Sun Gully), which reflect real life, as well as historical dramas and folk legends such as "Hong Lou Meng" (Dream of the Red Chamber), "Feng Xue Pei" (Matching in Wind and Snow), and "Hua Ting Hui" (Meeting at Hua Ting Pavilion), to celebrate the continued great leap forward of 1960 with the people of the capital.

    "Henan Quju Opera" (also called "Quzi"), is a young opera genre native to Henan, rich in local flavor, and originating from the folk, with a completely different style from Beijing Quju. Its performance is simple and honest, cheerful and lively, and the singing is beautiful and moving. The orchestra is accompanied by instruments such as the Da Xian (Quhu), Guzheng, Sheng, Xiao, Dizi, and Sanxian. In Henan, almost everyone can sing Quzi, making it one of the most popular opera genres in the area. Li Jinbo, Bai Yongling, Geng Gengchen, Ma Quanxi, and young actors Wang Xiuling, Zhao Dechun, Zhang Xianglan, Liu Yulan, etc., who are participating in the performances in Beijing this time, are all actors who won the Excellent Actor Award in the Second Henan Provincial Opera Festival.

    Chu Opera and Gaoqiang from Hubei

    The Wuhan City Chu Opera Troupe from Hubei Province also rushed to Beijing on the eve of the New Year in 1960. They will perform traditional Chu Opera plays such as "An Tang Ren Mu" (Recognizing Mother in the Nunnery), the satirical play "Da Doufu" (Making Tofu), and the Hubei Gaoqiang operas "Bai Yue Ji" (The Moon Worship Story) and "Bai Hua Zeng Jian" (A Hundred Flowers Presenting a Sword), which have been revived in recent years, for the people of the capital.

    Hubei Gaoqiang is one of the oldest opera genres in China. During the Great Revolution, Hubei Gaoqiang artists actively participated in propaganda work. Before liberation, due to the devastation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, it was almost lost. In recent years, under the guidance of the Party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" opera policy, thanks to the efforts of relevant cultural departments in Hubei Province, six veteran artists who were engaged in Gaoqiang music were found, and more than two hundred songs have been excavated and sorted out. The actors participating in the performance of "Bai Yue Ji" and other operas are all outstanding young actors trained after liberation.

    Yue Opera "Princess Wencheng"

    Yue Opera attracts Beijing audiences with its elegant Jiangnan style. This time, the Tianjin Yue Opera Troupe is bringing not only "Qing Tan" (Love Trial) and other plays familiar to Yue Opera enthusiasts, but also the newly arranged "Princess Wencheng."

    The historical story of Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty marrying into Tubo (present-day Tibet) is probably known to many people. The Tianjin Yue Opera Troupe's "Princess Wencheng" is adapted and performed based on this historical story widely circulated in Tibet, combined with the characteristics of this opera genre. This play better shows the close relationship between the Han and Tibetan people in history. [Nan] (Attached picture)

    During the New Year period, in addition to continuing to perform new plays such as "Liulang Visits His Mother," the China Peking Opera Theater is also preparing to stage a batch of newly arranged large-scale plays, including the modern drama "Keshan Hongri" (Red Sun over Keshan) and "Sun An Dong Ben" (Sun An's Upright Actions), "Yizhihua" (A Branch of Flower), "Luhua Ji" (Reed Flower Scheme), and "Yangmen Nüjiang" (The Women Generals of the Yang Family).

　　在戏曲舞台上
    浓郁的河南风味曲剧
    首次来京的河南郑州市曲剧团，带来了反映现实生活的“赶脚”、“下乡”、“朝阳沟”，以及反映历史故事和民间传说的古装戏“红楼梦”、“风雪配”、“花亭会”等剧，和首都人民一起迎接继续跃进的1960年新年。
    “河南曲剧”（也叫曲子），和北京的曲剧有着完全不同的风格，是河南土生土长、富有浓郁地方风味、来自民间的年轻剧种。它的表演淳厚朴实，爽朗明快，唱腔优美动人；乐队是以大弦（曲胡）、古筝、笙、箫、笛、三弦等乐器组成来伴奏的。在河南几乎人人都会唱曲子，是当地最流行的剧种之一。这次来京演出的李金波、白永玲、耿庚辰、马全喜和青年演员王秀玲、赵德春、张香兰、刘玉兰等，都是河南省第二届戏曲观摩会演中获得优秀演员奖的演员。
    从湖北来了楚剧和高腔
    湖北武汉市楚剧团也在1960年新年前夕赶来北京，他们将为首都人民演出楚剧传统剧目“庵堂认母”、讽刺剧“打豆腐”，和近年来才救活了的湖北高腔“拜月记”、“百花赠剑”等剧。
    湖北高腔是我国古老的剧种之一。大革命时期，湖北高腔艺人曾积极参加宣传鼓动工作。解放前由于国民党反动派的摧残，差不多快要失传了。近年来，在党的“百花齐放”的戏曲方针指导下，经过湖北省有关文化部门的努力，才找到六位搞高腔音乐的老艺人，目前已挖掘和整理出二百多首曲子。这次参加“拜月记”等剧演出的都是解放后培养出来的优秀青年演员。
    越剧“文成公主”
    越剧以它清丽的江南风格吸引着北京的观众。这一次天津市越剧团带来的剧目，不仅有越剧爱好者熟悉的“情探”等剧，还有新排的“文成公主”。
    唐代文成公主下嫁吐蕃（今西藏）的历史故事，差不多是很多人都知道的了。天津市越剧团的“文成公主”，就是根据这个在西藏民间广泛流传的历史故事，并结合本剧种的特点来编演的。这个戏较好地表现了汉藏两族人民在历史上的亲密关系。　〔楠〕（附图片）
    中国京剧院在新年期间，除继续上演“六郎探母”等新剧目以外，还准备上演一批刚排出的大型剧目，其中有现代剧“柯山红日”和“孙安动本”、“一枝花”、“芦花计”、“杨门女将”等。
