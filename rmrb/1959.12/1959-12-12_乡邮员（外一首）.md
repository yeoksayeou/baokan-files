   The Village Postman (and another poem)
    Li Ying The village postman comrade is here, through such heavy wind and snow, such a long road; the violent ice and snow have sealed the mountains and rivers, but cannot seal the village postman's feet. Shoulders carrying a mailbag, face full of smiles; a sheepskin coat flutters in the wind and snow, two leather boots squeak in the snow. "Village postman comrade, quickly come inside, shake off the wind, sand, and snow, drink this bowl of hot wine to suppress the snow of ten thousand miles, and then come to the fire to warm your feet!" "Not cold, not cold, still have to go, so many families are waiting for good news and greetings; the Great Leap Forward of the whole country is twisted into one rope, how can I delay even a minute and a second!" A letter in the door makes the milk tea in the bowl even more fragrant; a letter in the door makes the lamp flicker brighter. Outside the door, another gust of wind and snow sweeps away the village postman's burst of hearty laughter; the white wilderness has no one, only a black dot swaying between heaven and earth...
    "Girl" [Writing about a female observer at a certain meteorological station] How high is the sky in the north, how big is the land in the north, when people talk about its climate, they can only shake their heads in response. One moment the sun is shining, the next moment the sky is full of wind and sand, one moment heavy snow is flying, the next moment there are wildflowers all over the fields. Speaking of hot weather, the fat mutton is boiled rotten on the sand, speaking of cold weather, the wolf tails are frozen off; "But what's so scary about that?" the girl replies. She is still wearing the little floral jacket made by her mother, from Jiangnan to the foot of Yinshan, a face of youth wrapped under her headscarf, willing to endure wind and rain for the motherland. A thermometer - measuring the body temperature and pulse of the Gobi; an anemometer - holding back ten thousand untamed wild horses. But what instrument can record her love for the motherland? Don't look at her weak body like a sapling, wind, frost, rain and snow are all under her feet. Someone asked her if she missed the South, she clapped her hands and brushed the sand off her body: "When orioles fly and grass grows here, I will truly be home!"

   乡邮员（外一首）
    李瑛乡邮员同志过来了，这么大的风雪，这么远的道；暴戾的冰雪封了山和水，却封不住乡邮员的脚。肩上背着邮包，脸上含满笑；一件羊皮袄在风雪里飘，两只皮靰鞡在雪地里叫。“乡邮员同志快屋坐，把风沙、把雪花一齐抖掉，喝下这碗热酒压下万里雪，再到火边来烤烤脚！”“不冷，不冷，还要上道，多少人家等着喜讯和问好；全国大跃进拧成了一股绳，我怎能多耽搁一分一秒！”门里一封信，使碗里的奶茶更香了；门里一封信，使家里的灯花更亮了。门外又一阵风雪，拥走了乡邮员一串豪笑；白白的山野没有一个人，只一个黑点在天地间摇……
    “娃娃”〔写某气象站的一位女观测员〕塞北的天有多高，塞北的地有多大，人们说起它的气候，只能用摇头表示回答。一会儿阳光满地，一会儿漫空的风沙，一会儿大雪横飞一会儿又是遍野黄花。说天热，沙上煮烂肥羊肉，说天冷，冻掉条条狼尾巴；“不过，这又有什么可怕？”答话的却是个娃娃。她还穿着妈妈作的小花袄，从江南走到阴山下，头巾下裹一脸青春，为祖国愿来受风吹雨打。一只温度计——测量漠北的体温和脉搏；一架风速器——挽住万匹脱缰的野马。可她对祖国的爱情，又有什么仪表能够记下？别看她稚弱的身躯像一棵树苗，风霜雨雪却全在脚下。有人问她想不想南方，她两手一拍身上的沙：“什么时候这里莺飞草长，我便是真正回到了家！”（附图片）
