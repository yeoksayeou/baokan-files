    Simultaneously Emphasizing "Planting, Collecting, Utilizing, Processing, and Reserving"
    Dayao Mobilizes on Five Fronts to Widely Find Pig Feed
    The Entire County Universally Builds Feed Bases, Supplying the Majority of Feed for More Than 100,000 Pigs
    (By Our Newspaper) Yunnan Province's Dayao County has summarized a set of experiences for solving pig feed problems in its pig raising practices: Planting – planting feed crops and establishing feed bases; Collecting – collecting wild feed; Utilizing – utilizing agricultural product by-products; Processing – combining with agricultural and sideline product processing; Reserving – appropriately reserving enough concentrated feed. The masses call this set of experiences the "five-character" magic weapon for solving pig feed problems.
    Dayao County's pig raising industry has developed rapidly this year. In less than a year, the number of live pigs has increased by about 80%. In order to promote the continuous prosperity of the pig raising industry, Party committees at all levels throughout the county paid attention to grasping the feed problem from the very beginning. First, they promoted the experience of planting feed crops and establishing feed bases. Dayao farmers had a habit of growing feed in the past; after the establishment of the communes, collective pig raising developed rapidly, and some production teams, in order to adapt to this new situation, used wasteland and planted feed crops near the pigsties. Last year, each production team in the Xinlu Commune planted more than 3,000 ponds of tallow gourds along roadsides and walls. The most productive tallow gourd yielded 5,000 jin of feed, and the least productive yielded 2,000 jin, with one gourd being enough to feed one pig. The Dayao County Party Committee immediately summarized the experience of the Xinlu Commune and vigorously promoted it throughout the county. The County Party Committee put forward the slogan of "Planting on all Four Sides, Planting Wherever There is Space, Establishing Bases, and Vigorously Planting Three Vegetables," requiring all communes to use the scattered vacant land and wasteland along fields, ditches, rivers, and gardens to plant various feed crops, such as potatoes, kale, and tallow gourds. At the same time, production teams demarcated special fields to specifically plant a large amount of high-quality concentrated feed, such as "three vegetables" (sugar beets, Chinese cabbage, and radishes) and miscellaneous grains. Mountainous communes were required to reclaim wasteland and use the original fallow land to plant feed crops. In the dam areas where there is very little wasteland, full use should be made of the "four sides." The benefits of planting feed crops and establishing feed bases are numerous, providing a reliable guarantee for pig feed. Each management district and production team can also plan in advance and arrange different varieties, so that pig feed can be diverse and increase nutrition. Moreover, these feed crops are almost all high-yield crops, with large quantities and high quality, which can meet the needs of pig raising. The planting and harvesting of feed land are arranged by the production team, with daily management and processing contracted to the feed professional team. After the experience of the Xinlu Commune was promoted throughout the county, all commune production teams acted swiftly, and in a crash effort, planted feed crops at the rate of one mu of feed land for every twenty pigs, which achieved great results. Over the past year, most of the feed eaten by the county's more than 100,000 pigs has come from feed bases. This year, the Lianchi Management District of the Yongding Commune planted 472 mu of sugar beets, 1,288 mu of sweet potatoes, and 148 mu of yellow radishes. At the beginning of the year, the entire management district raised 312 pigs, and the feed was not enough; now, the number of pigs has increased to 1,310, and there is still a surplus of feed.
    The 3,410 production teams in the county's twenty-five communes have each established a collective feed warehouse. Before there were feed warehouses, whatever was collected was fed immediately, without any reserves. Once winter arrived, there would be a shortage of feed. After the establishment of the warehouses, the production teams' feed warehouses accumulated the normally surplus feed, which could be used to supplement shortages. Now, the entire county has already dry-stored 180,000 jin of feed, and has also dug more than 120 silage cellars, with more than 100,000 jin of silage.
    In addition to planting, there is collecting. During the autumn harvest and autumn planting campaign, all communes seized the opportunity and organized labor to launch a crash "small autumn harvest" campaign to collect various wild feeds. The Xinlu Commune started collecting wild feed to feed pigs in May and continued until the end of October, collecting more than 850,000 jin in total. In addition, the amount of agricultural crop by-products used is also very large. At the same time, establish "five workshops," namely distilleries, starch workshops, oil mills, tofu workshops, and sugar mills, use the collected acorns to make wine, use sugar beets to make sugar, and the remaining dregs are used to feed pigs, which is both economical and effective. In addition to these, in the distribution of grain, all communes, management districts, and production teams in Dayao County, in accordance with the spirit of reserving enough feed and using special grain for special purposes, reserved a portion of concentrated feed and established special warehouses for specialized grain management.

### “种、采、用、工、留”并举  大姚五路出动广找猪饲料  全县普建饲料基地，供应了十多万头猪的大部饲料

    “种、采、用、工、留”并举
    大姚五路出动广找猪饲料
    全县普建饲料基地，供应了十多万头猪的大部饲料
    本报讯　云南省大姚县在养猪的实践中，总结出一套解决猪饲料的经验；种——种植饲料作物，建立饲料基地；采——采集野生饲料；用——利用农产品的副产物；工——和农副业产品加工结合；留——适当留够精饲料。群众都把这套经验称作解决猪饲料的“五字”法宝。
    大姚县今年养猪事业发展很快，不到一年时间，生猪头数增加了八成左右。为了促进养猪事业的不断兴旺，全县各级党委一开始就注意抓饲料问题。首先推广种植饲料作物、建立饲料基地的经验。大姚农民过去就有种饲料的习惯；办了公社以后，集体养猪迅速发展，一些生产队为了适应这种新情况，利用荒地和在猪厩附近种饲料作物。新芦公社各生产队去年在路边墙脚种了三千多塘洋瓜。每棵洋瓜最多的收五千斤饲料，最少的也有二千斤，一棵就能养一头猪。大姚县委马上总结了新芦公社的经验，并在全县范围内大力推广。县委提出了“四边下种，见空就种，建立基地，大种三菜”的口号，要求各公社利用田边、沟边、河边、园边星星点点的空地和荒地，种各种各样的饲料作物，如土豆、牛皮菜、洋瓜等。同时由生产队划出专门田地，专种数量多、质量好的精饲料，如“三菜”（甜菜、大白菜、萝卜）和杂粮。要求山区各公社的生产队开荒和利用原来的轮歇地来种饲料作物。在荒地很少的坝区，主要充分利用“四边”。种饲料作物和建立饲料基地的好处非常多，使养猪的饲料有了可靠的保证。各管理区、生产队还可以事先规划，安排不同品种，使猪食能多种多样，增加养料。而且这些饲料作物，差不多都是高产作物，量多质高，能满足养猪的需要。饲料地的下种和收获，由生产队安排人力，日常管理加工包给饲料专业组负责。新芦公社的经验在全县推广开以后，各公社生产队火速行动，按二十头猪一亩饲料地突击栽种饲料作物，收到了很大效果。一年来，全县的十多万头猪吃的饲料大部分来自饲料基地。永定公社莲池管理区今年种了甜菜四百七十二亩，红薯一千二百八十八亩，黄萝卜一百四十八亩。年初，全管理区养猪三百一十二头，饲料还不够；现在，猪发展到一千三百一十头，饲料还有余。
    全县二十五个公社的三千四百一十个生产队，每个队建立了一个集体饲料仓库。在没有饲料仓库的时候，随时采来随时喂掉，没有储备。一到冬季，就缺饲料。建立仓库后，生产队的饲料仓库把平常多余的饲料积蓄起来，可以积余补缺。现在，全县已经干储了十八万斤饲料，还挖好青贮室一百二十多个，青贮饲料十万多斤。
    种之外就是采。在秋收秋种运动中，各公社抓住时机，组织劳动力突击开展了“小秋收”运动，采集各种野生饲料。新芦公社从5月份开始就陆续采野生饲料喂猪，一直采到10月底，共采了八十五万多斤。此外，利用农作物副产物的数量也很大。同时，建立“五坊”，就是酒坊、粉坊、油坊、豆腐坊、糖坊，用采集的橡子做酒，用甜菜做糖，剩下的渣子就拿来喂猪，这样，既经济又有效。除了这些，大姚县的各公社、管理区和生产队在粮食分配中，都根据留够饲料、专粮专用的精神，留了一部分精饲料，并建立了专门仓库，专粮专管。
