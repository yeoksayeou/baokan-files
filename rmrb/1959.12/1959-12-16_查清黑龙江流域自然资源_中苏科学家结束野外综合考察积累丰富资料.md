Xinhua News Agency, December 14th. The field work of the Sino-Soviet cooperative comprehensive survey of the Heilongjiang River Basin has concluded. Now, the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Sciences' survey teams are jointly starting to compile a summary report of the survey work as a scientific basis for the two governments to consider developing the natural resources of the Heilongjiang River Basin.

This survey work began in August 1956. According to the agreement between the two countries, the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Sciences and relevant departments cooperated to form comprehensive survey teams of the Heilongjiang River Basin to conduct investigations in the Heilongjiang River Basin within their respective countries, and to mutually appoint experts as consultants. Joint teams were organized to work together in the border areas of the two countries.

In the past four years, the Comprehensive Survey Team of the Heilongjiang River Basin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, composed of about 30 units from relevant central and local departments and universities, has conducted scientific surveys in five aspects—water conservancy and hydropower, geology, natural conditions, transportation, and economy—in the Heilongjiang River Basin under the leadership of the Party, with the enthusiastic support of the local people, and with brotherly Soviet assistance. Much of the survey work was carried out in uninhabited areas where no scientific research had been conducted in the past. The survey team members climbed mountains and waded through rivers, traversing all regions of the basin, initially clarifying the natural and economic conditions of the basin and accumulating rich scientific data. In terms of hydropower, they identified the waterpower resources of the Heilongjiang River and suitable dam sites for building hydropower stations, and proposed preliminary cascade development plans. Currently, Chinese and Soviet survey and design departments are jointly preparing a technical and economic report on the development of the Ergun River and the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River's hydropower resources. It has been clarified that the Heilongjiang River's hydropower resources are very abundant and have good natural conditions, allowing for the construction of several giant hydropower stations. In terms of geology, they have basically clarified the geological structure, mineral resources, and metallogenic rules of the Heilongjiang River Basin, pointing out the direction for further mineral prospecting and exploration.

In terms of natural conditions, they studied the characteristics of the Heilongjiang River Basin in terms of climate, hydrology, geomorphology, soil, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, explored ways to increase the unit area yield of crops and expand the cultivated area by reclaiming wasteland, as well as the establishment of new grain bases. At the same time, they studied the forest resources in the basin and proposed methods for felling and regeneration. In terms of transportation, they studied the water and land, river-sea intermodal transport network of the Heilongjiang River Basin, and made long-term plans based on the comprehensive utilization of various modes of transportation. In addition, they also studied the possibility and economic benefits of developing the Songliao Canal. In terms of economy, they comprehensively studied the current state of the national economy and natural resources of the Heilongjiang River Basin, and demonstrated the scientific assumptions for the long-term development and production layout of industries such as ferrous metallurgy, non-ferrous metallurgy, electricity, fuel, chemicals, and forestry.

    查清黑龙江流域自然资源
    中苏科学家结束野外综合考察积累丰富资料
    新华社14日讯　中苏合作的黑龙江流域综合考察的野外工作已经结束。现在中苏两国科学院考察队正在开始共同编写考察工作的总结报告，作为两国政府考虑开发黑龙江流域自然资源的科学依据。
    这项考察工作是1956年8月开始的。根据两国协定，由中苏两国科学院和有关部门协作，各自组成黑龙江流域综合考察队，在本国境内黑龙江流域进行调查，并且互聘专家为顾问；在两国边境地段，组织联合小队共同进行工作。
    在过去的四年中，由中央和地方有关部门和高等院校约三十个单位组成的中国科学院黑龙江流域综合考察队，在党的领导、当地人民热烈支持及苏联兄弟般的帮助下，在黑龙江流域进行了水利水能、地质、自然条件、交通运输及经济等五方面的科学考察。考察工作有很多是在荒无人烟、过去从未进行过科学研究的地区进行的。考察队人员爬山涉水，踏遍了流域各区，初步摸清了本流域的自然、经济情况，积累了丰富的科学资料。在水能方面，他们查明了黑龙江的水力资源及适于修建水电站的坝址，并且提出了初步的梯级开发方案。目前，中苏两国勘测设计部门正在共同编写开发额尔古纳河及黑龙江上游水力资源的技术经济报告。已经明确，黑龙江的水力资源是非常丰富的，而且有着良好的自然条件，可以建立若干个巨型水电站。在地质方面，他们基本上查明了黑龙江流域的地质构造、矿产资源情况和成矿规律，为进一步开展矿产普查勘探工作指出了方向。
    在自然条件方面，他们研究了黑龙江流域的气候、水文、地貌、土壤、林业、畜牧业、渔业等方面的特点，探讨了提高农作物单位面积产量和开垦荒地扩大耕地面积的途径及新的粮食基地的建立问题，同时研究了流域内的森林资源，提出了采伐和更新的方法。在交通运输方面，研究了黑龙江流域水陆、江海联运的运输网，并从综合利用各种运输方式出发作了远景规划。此外，还研究了松辽运河开发的可能性和经济效益。在经济方面，综合研究了黑龙江流域的国民经济现状、自然资源，论证了黑色冶金、有色冶金、电力、燃料、化学和森林等工业的远景发展和生产布局的科学假设方案。
