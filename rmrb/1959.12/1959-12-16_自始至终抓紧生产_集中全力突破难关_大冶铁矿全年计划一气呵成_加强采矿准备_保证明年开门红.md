Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 15th: The Daye Iron Mine, which supplies ironmaking raw materials to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO), has already completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way. The total output value plan was completed sixty days ahead of schedule; the output of raw ore was completed thirty-eight days ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 27,274 tons for lump ore, and the output of fine ore was completed sixty-three days ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 34,523 tons; the quality of the ore was good; the cost was reduced by 4.3% compared with the plan, and the labor productivity completed 113% of the plan.

This year, the Daye Iron Mine Party Committee has consistently adhered to putting politics in command in leading production, and has adopted the method of combining centralized leadership with vigorously launching mass movements, constantly opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, so that the campaign to increase production and practice economy can be carried out in a deep and sustained manner. The production in each month of the first half of the year and the third quarter were all "red." Since October, they have vigorously and thoroughly carried out the general line education, making the enthusiasm of the workers even greater, the style of the cadres more in-depth, and the production leaping higher and higher.

They emphasized grasping tightly from the beginning, proposing to "grasp the first hour of the shift, grasp the first shift of the day, grasp the first day of the ten-day period, grasp the first ten-day period of the month, and grasp the first month of the quarter." Each shift calculated accounts and conducted evaluations. This reversed the previous situation of "slack at the beginning and tight at the end" and "sudden rise and fall in output," ensuring the comprehensive and balanced completion of the plan. In the first quarter, they completed 21.25% of the annual plan, in the second quarter they completed 25.34% of the annual plan, and in the third quarter they completed 34.9% of the annual plan, meeting the requirements put forward by the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China for each quarter. In the method of formulating plans, they also changed the past practice of relying solely on a few office personnel sitting in the office to compile them, and instead used the "three-in-one combination" of cadres, workers, and technicians to compile them on-site. After the plan was compiled, they explained the significance, the tasks, the drawings, the key points, and the measures to the workers, and divided the production targets to each worker so that the workers knew what to do. The workers reflected, "Each shift calculates detailed accounts, everyone knows what to do, grasp early and grasp tightly, production increases day by day."

The iron mine also continuously mobilized workers to overcome key production problems, so that production could achieve active balance. The entire mine established a "key problem tackling headquarters," and the workshops established "key problem tackling groups." Major production problems were organized by the key problem tackling headquarters to mobilize the mine's manpower and material resources to attack. This year, they organized six mine-wide key problem tackling activities around improving ore output and quality, each of which promoted production. For example, at the beginning of the year, they mobilized workers to successfully trial-produce waterproof explosives, breaking through the key production problem of blasting in the rainy season and achieving a "red" production in the first quarter. Later, in response to the key problem of poor ore quality, workers were mobilized to strengthen technical management, which greatly improved the quality of the ore. In August, in order to adapt to the increased demand for ore after the commissioning of WISCO's No. 2 blast furnace, the workers launched a key problem tackling activity centered on increasing the daily output of ore, and in just ten days, the daily output of ore was increased by nearly one time, and the stripping volume increased from an average of 12,000 cubic meters per day to an average of 20,000 cubic meters per day.

Currently, the workers of the Daye Iron Mine are seizing the last half month of this year to increase the production of more ore, so as to reserve "grain and grass" for the production of WISCO's blast furnace next year, and at the same time, strengthen the preparation of mining work to ensure a "flying start" in production next year.

    自始至终抓紧生产  集中全力突破难关
    大冶铁矿全年计划一气呵成
    加强采矿准备  保证明年开门红
    新华社武汉15日电　为武钢供应炼铁原料的大冶铁矿，已经提前全面超额完成今年的生产计划。总产值计划提前六十天完成；原矿提前三十八天，块矿提前五十三天超额二万七千二百七十四吨，粉矿提前六十三天超额三万四千五百二十三吨完成了计划；矿石质量良好；成本比计划降低4.3％，劳动生产率完成计划113％。
    今年，大冶铁矿党委在领导生产中始终坚持政治挂帅，采取集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方法，不断地反右倾、鼓干劲，使增产节约运动深入持久地开展。上半年每个月和第三季度的生产都是满堂红。10月份以来他们又大张旗鼓地深入开展总路线教育；使职工干劲越鼓越足，干部作风更加深入，生产越跃越高。
    他们强调一开始就抓紧，提出班抓第一小时，天抓第一班，旬抓第一天，月抓第一旬，季抓第一月。班班算账，班班评比。这样就扭转了过去生产上前松后紧、产量骤升骤降的局面，保证全面均衡地完成计划。第一季度他们完成年计划21.25％，第二季度完成年计划25.34％，第三季度完成年计划34.9％，达到中共黄石市委各季提出的要求。在编制计划的方法上，他们也改变过去只依靠少数科室人员坐在办公室里编的作法，由干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”在现场编制。计划编好后，又向职工交意义，交任务，交图样，交关键，交措施，并且把生产指标分到每一个工人，使工人心中有数。职工反映说：“班班算细账，人人心里亮，抓早又抓紧，生产日日上。”
    铁矿还不断发动职工攻破生产关键，使生产达到积极平衡。全矿成立了攻关指挥部，车间成立了攻关指挥小组，重大生产关键由攻关指挥部组织全矿人力、物力攻打。今年他们围绕提高矿石产量和质量，组织了六次全矿性的攻关活动，每一次都推动了生产。例如，年初时发动职工试制成功防水炸药，突破了雨季爆破的生产关键，实现了第一季度生产满堂红。后来针对矿石质量不好的关键，发动职工加强技术管理，使矿石质量大为提高。八月份为适应武钢二号高炉投入生产后矿石需要量增加的情况，职工们开展了以提高矿石日产量为中心的攻关活动，仅十天时间就将矿石日产量提高近一倍，剥离量由平均每天一万二千立方米上升到平均每天二万立方米。
    目前大冶铁矿职工正抓紧今年最后半个多月增产更多的矿石，为武钢高炉明年生产提前储备“粮草”同时加强采矿的准备工作，保证明年生产开门红。
