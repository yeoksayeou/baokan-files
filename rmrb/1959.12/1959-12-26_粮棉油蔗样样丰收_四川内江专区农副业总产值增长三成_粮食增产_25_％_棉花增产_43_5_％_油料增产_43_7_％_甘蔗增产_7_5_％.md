According to Sichuan Daily news, Neijiang Special District in Sichuan Province overfulfilled its agricultural production plan this year, achieving an all-round bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oil, and sugarcane. According to actual harvest statistics, the total sown area of ​​grain in the district this year decreased by 700,000 mu compared with last year, but the total output still increased by 25% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Total cotton output increased by 43.5% compared with last year, total oil output increased by 43.7% compared with last year, and total sugarcane output increased by 7.5% compared with last year. At the same time, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries also greatly increased production compared with last year. The total agricultural and sideline production value of the district increased by 32% compared with last year.

　　Before communization, the contradiction between grain crops and cash crops competing for labor and fertilizer in Neijiang Special District had not been resolved. After communization, this problem was readily solved. From the beginning of sowing, the people's communes, in accordance with the principle of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production, grasped grain crops on the one hand and cash crops on the other. They established specialized field management teams for cotton, grain, oil, and sugarcane, responsible from planting to harvesting. Neijiang County extracted 25% of its labor force to form specialized sugarcane field management teams, establishing a responsibility system that greatly strengthened the production responsibility of the commune members. The number of applications of fertilizer, soil, pest control, and irrigation all increased by one to two times compared with previous years. Zhenzi Commune in Anyue County divided its labor force into three fronts, managing grain, cotton, and peanuts respectively according to physical strength and technical expertise, making the best use of talent and managing all crops meticulously. In order to solve the contradiction between grain crops and cash crops competing for labor and fertilizer, Lezhi County classified and ranked labor and fertilizer, determining that, under normal circumstances, labor and fertilizer used for cash crops should not be used for other crops.

　　The all-round Great Leap Forward in grain, cotton, oil, and sugarcane has further changed the face of Neijiang Special District. Before 1952, this was still a grain-deficient special district, and more than 50 million jin of grain had to be transferred in from other places every year. Now, not only is it not necessary to transfer in grain, but also more than 400 million jin of grain can be transferred out to support national construction. At the same time, the bumper harvest has also provided a large amount of raw materials for the textile industry, sugar industry, and oil pressing industry, making a great contribution to the accumulation of construction funds and the improvement of people's living standards. At present, Neijiang Special District has overfulfilled its grain, cotton, and oil procurement tasks. As of December 6, the district had procured 921.6 million jin of grain, exceeding the state-assigned task by 4.7%; it had acquired 100.382 million jin of peanuts, exceeding the assigned task by 3.8%. Due to the overfulfillment of the oil crop acquisition task, the amount of edible oil transferred out of the district this year has increased by more than double compared with the same period last year. The harvested sugarcane, totaling more than 420 million jin, has been sent to sugar factories, basically meeting the raw material needs of the district's sugar factories.

　　粮棉油蔗样样丰收
　　四川内江专区农副业总产值增长三成
　　粮食增产25％　棉花增产43.5％  油料增产43.7％　甘蔗增产7.5％
    据四川日报消息　四川内江专区今年农业生产超额完成计划，粮、棉、油、蔗全面大丰收。根据实收统计，全区今年粮食播种面积比去年减少七十万亩，但总产量仍比大跃进的1958年增加25％，棉花总产量比去年增加43.5％，油料总产量比去年增加43.7％，甘蔗总产量比去年增加7.5％；同时林、牧、副、渔也比去年大大增产。全区农副业总产值比去年增加32％。
    内江专区在农业社时，粮食作物与经济作物争劳动力、争肥料的矛盾一直没有解决。公社化以后，这个问题便迎刃而解了。播种一开始，各人民公社就按照自给性生产与商品性生产同时并举的方针，一手抓粮食作物，一手抓经济作物，建立了棉、粮、油、蔗田间管理专业队，从种到收，负责到底。内江县抽出25％的劳动力组成甘蔗田间管理专业队，建立了责任制度，使社员的生产责任心大大加强，施肥、培土、治虫、灌水的次数，都比往年增加一至二次。安岳县镇子公社把劳动力分成三条战线，根据体力强弱和技术特长，分别管理粮食、棉花、花生，作到人尽其材，使样样作物都管得很精细。乐至县为了解决粮食作物与经济作物争劳动力和争肥料的矛盾，对劳动力和肥料进行了分类排队，确定在一般情况下，不把用在经济作物上的劳动力和肥料用在其他作物上。
    粮、棉、油、蔗全面大跃进，进一步改变了内江专区的面貌。1952年以前，这里还是一个缺粮的专区，每年要从外地调进五千多万斤粮食，现在不仅不需要调进，而且还可以调出四亿多斤粮食支援国家建设。同时，大丰收还给纺织工业、制糖工业、榨油工业提供了大批原料，为国家积累建设资金和提高人民生活水平作出了很大的贡献。现在，内江专区粮、棉、油的征购任务都已超额完成。到12月6日，全区已征购粮食九亿二千一百六十万斤，超过国家分配任务的4.7％；已收购花生一亿零三百八十二万斤，超过分配任务的3.8％。由于油料作物的收购任务超额完成，全区今年食油外调数量比去年同期增加一倍以上。丰收的甘蔗已送进糖厂四亿二千多万斤，基本上满足了全区糖厂原料的需要。
