    Skillful Loading for Increased Capacity
    Through skillful loading for increased capacity, the Beijing Railway Bureau has increased the average load of each freight car by 8.1 tons. If the national railway system could achieve this level, it could transport several million tons of additional cargo for the country each month. This is of great significance for resolving the contradiction between the shortage of cars and the abundance of goods, and for meeting the needs of all aspects of the national economy.
    The key to increasing the static load capacity of freight cars lies in skillful loading for increased capacity. Over the past decade, railway workers across the country have increased the static load capacity of freight cars from 26.6 tons to 39.1 tons. Today, the employees of the Beijing Railway Bureau have further increased it to 48 tons. These figures indicate, on the one hand, that railway workers have achieved great success in finding ways to improve efficiency; on the other hand, they show that there is great potential in the vehicles.
    As the end of the year approaches, transportation tasks become even heavier. Let us learn from the experience of the Beijing Railway Bureau, make every effort to tap potential, and transport more and faster, to create more favorable conditions for completing the annual national economic plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets.

    巧装多载
    北京铁路办事处通过巧装多载，使每辆货车平均多装了八点一吨货。如果全国铁路系统都能达到这个水平，每月就能为国家多运几百万吨货。这对解决车少货多二者不相适应的矛盾，满足国民经济各方面的需要，意义是很大的。
    提高货车静载重的关键，在于巧装多载。十年来，全国铁路工人把货车静载重从二十六点六吨提高到三十九点一吨。今天，北京铁路办事处职工在这个基础上，又提高到四十八吨。这些数字一方面表示了铁路工人千方百计找窍门，取得了很大的成就；另一方面又说明了车辆的潜力很大。
    靠近年关，运输任务更重。让我们学习北京铁路办事处的经验，千方百计挖掘潜力，多运、快运，为提前超额完成全年国民经济计划创造更有利的条件。
