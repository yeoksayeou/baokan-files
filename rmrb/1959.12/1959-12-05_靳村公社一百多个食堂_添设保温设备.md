More Than 100 Dining Halls in Jincun Commune
    Add Insulation Equipment
    (Our dispatch) To earnestly ensure that commune members eat well and eat hot food in winter, Jincun Commune in Ruyang County, Henan Province, is vigorously developing winterizing equipment such as warming vats and warming cages in the dining halls. All 169 dining halls in the commune have added warming vats to ensure that commune members do not eat cold food in winter.
    Seeing that the cold winter was approaching, the commune's Party committee quickly organized a professional team to build warming vats, putting forward the slogan "Work hard for three days to fully realize warming vat implementation and ensure that commune members do not eat cold food." In three days, the entire commune built a total of 185 warming vats and 25 warming cages. The Xiaobai Brigade used the method of "repairing the old and patching the broken," and the brigade's dining halls solved the problem of warming vats and warming cages ahead of schedule.
    The practice of adding warming vats and warming cages in the Jincun Commune dining halls has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of commune members.

    添设保温设备
    本报讯　河南省汝阳县靳村公社为了切实保证社员冬季吃好吃热，大抓食堂内的暖缸、暖笼等过冬设备，全公社一百六十九个食堂全部添设了暖缸，作到冬天不让社员吃冷食。
    这个公社的党委看到寒冬临近，便迅速组织了砌暖缸专业队，提出“大干三天，全部实现暖缸化，让社员不喝冷饭”的口号。全公社三天共砌暖缸一百八十五个、暖笼二十五个。小白大队运用了“旧的修、坏的补”的办法，全队的食堂提前解决了暖缸、暖笼问题。
    靳村公社食堂添设暖缸暖笼的做法，受到广大社员热烈欢迎。
