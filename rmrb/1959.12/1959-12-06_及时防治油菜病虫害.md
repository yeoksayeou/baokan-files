    Timely Prevention and Control of Rapeseed Diseases and Pests
    In some areas of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and other provinces, rapeseed fields are generally experiencing aphid infestations, which are affecting the growth of the seedlings to varying degrees. According to surveys conducted by the Ningbo Agricultural Science Research Institute in Zhejiang and the Hanzhong Experimental Station in Hubei in mid-November, generally each plant has seven or eight aphids, with a maximum of one hundred and fifty to two hundred. Some leaves are curled, withered, and falling off, causing missing seedlings and flower seedlings. Some plots have even been plowed and replanted. The main reasons for the severe aphid outbreak this year are: the autumn weather was dry, the temperature was high, and the sowing period was generally ten days earlier. With the occurrence and spread of aphids, rapeseed virus diseases have also appeared in many places.
    Rapeseed aphids and virus diseases are very harmful to rapeseed. If rapeseed is attacked by virus diseases in the early stage of growth, the plants will grow poorly and may even die.
    In order to ensure that winter rapeseed safely overwinters and enters the spring, all winter rapeseed producing areas must pay close attention to the development of these diseases and insects, and prevent and control them as soon as they are discovered. Many experiences have proved that timely prevention and control can control the development of insects and diseases. This year, Haining, Zhejiang, has eliminated aphid infestations on 250,000 mu of rapeseed due to large-scale and timely prevention and control.
    There are many pesticides for preventing and controlling rapeseed aphids. Pesticides 666 and cotton oil soap, as well as indigenous pesticides such as derris, tobacco, stemona, yam bean seeds, croton, and thunder vine, all have certain control effects. The method of spraying rapeseed with one part of white alkali diluted with fifty to one hundred parts of water (dilute more when the weather is warm to avoid pesticide damage) used by Santai, Sichuan Province to prevent virus diseases can be tried in various places.

    及时防治油菜病虫害
    浙江、江西、湖北、湖南、四川等省一些地区的油菜田普遍发生蚜虫，不同程度地影响了菜苗的生长。据浙江宁波农业科学研究所和湖北汉中试验站11月中旬调查，一般每株有虫七、八只，最多一百五十只到二百只，部分叶片卷缩、枯萎、脱落，有的造成缺窝、花苗等现象，个别田块甚至已经翻犁改种。今年油菜蚜虫猛发的主要原因是：秋季天气干旱，温度较高和播种期一般提早十天。随着蚜虫的发生和传播，不少地方也出现了油菜的病毒病。
    油菜蚜虫、病毒病对油菜的危害都是很大的。油菜生长初期如果受到病毒病的侵害，植株会生长不良，严重的甚至死亡。
    为了保证冬油菜安全越过冬春，各冬油菜产区必须严密注意这些病虫的发展，随时发现随时防治。许多经验证明，及时防治就能控制虫、病发展。今年浙江海宁由于大面积及时防治，已消灭了二十五万亩油菜的蚜害。
    防治油菜蚜虫的农药很多。农药六六六、棉油皂，土农药鱼藤、烟草、百部、豆薯子、巴豆、雷公藤等，都有一定的防治效果。四川省三台用的白碱一份兑水五十份到一百份（天暖要稀释一些，以免发生药害）喷射油菜预防病毒病的方法，各地可以试用。　（张而耕）
