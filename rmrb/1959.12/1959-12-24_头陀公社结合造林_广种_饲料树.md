Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Toutuo People's Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, combines afforestation with mobilizing commune members to plant various high-yielding wild plants such as red leaf trees and wild earth trees on the mountains as pig feed.

These wild plants, once planted this winter, can be harvested in April next year. They have good nutritional content, and each mu can grow more than 15,000 jin of stems and leaves for feed each year. These wild plants, in addition to applying some ash when planting, do not require fertilization or much effort to manage afterward. In order to meet the needs of the great development of pig raising next year, the Toutuo Commune has planted 4,200 mu so far and is continuing to plant more.

　　头陀公社结合造林
    广种“饲料树”
    据新华社电　浙江黄岩县头陀人民公社结合造林，发动社员上山种植红叶树、野土树等多种高产野生植物，作为猪的饲料。
    这些野生草木今冬种下后，明年四月就可以采摘，营养成份好，每亩每年能长出作饲料的茎叶一万五千斤以上。这些野生植物除了在种的时候施点草木灰外，以后不需要施肥，也不用花工夫去管理。头陀公社为了适应明年养猪大发展的需要，目前已种了四千二百亩，还在继续种植。
