Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 13th: The Luo-Wu native railway, spanning two counties and one city in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, which began construction in February this year, was completed and opened to traffic on December 10th.

The Luo-Wu railway starts from the southern outskirts of Luohe City, passes through Yancheng County to Tieshan Mountain in Wuyang County, with a total length of 120 li. It connects the four steel production bases of Luohe, Yancheng, Wuyang, and Pingdingshan with the iron-rich Tieshan Mountain, Pingdingshan Coal Mine, the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, and the Shahe River navigation. Along the line, there are 24 bridges and culverts of various sizes and five railway stations. Each station is equipped with station buildings, switches, water supply, communications, and various signal equipment. The entire line currently has two small locomotives and two light locomotives, and 30 carriages. According to the design capacity, the daily transportation volume can reach 6,000 to 8,000 tons. During the construction period, it has already transported more than 3,000 tons of various materials.

This railway was built according to the urgent needs of objective development. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the industrial and agricultural production between Luohe and Wuyang has developed very rapidly, and the freight volume has increased several times. The original only road, passable in sunny weather but blocked in rainy weather, could not meet the freight needs at that time. Therefore, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to mobilize the masses to build a native railway.

During the construction of the railway, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the prefectural leadership departments adopted the method of launching a large-scale mass movement and self-reliance, organizing migrant workers to prepare materials while building roads, which made the project progress quite rapidly. The entire line's 800,000 cubic meters of roadbed engineering and 24 bridges and culverts were all completed in half a month, with good quality and meeting the expected standards. The people's communes along the line also collected a large amount of scrap iron and wood, and selected skilled craftsmen to process sleepers, spikes, and screws on-site, ensuring the needs of track laying.

The rails of this railway are all made of cast iron. At the beginning of the trial production, due to lack of experience and poor equipment conditions, the cast rails had fractures. At this time, some people said, "Cast iron is still cast iron, how can a phoenix fly out of a chicken coop?" The Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, according to this situation, led the workers to innovate technology and overcome this difficulty. Liu Dexi and Wang Changtai, veteran workers from the Luohe and Shangshui Machinery Factories, after more than 30 experiments, found a way to prevent rail fractures. The cast rails, after being tested and repeatedly subjected to pressure by the Railway Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways, proved that the quality met the requirements. Subsequently, eight machinery factories in Luohe, Xuchang, and Shangshui began mass production to meet the needs of track laying.

During the construction of this railway, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and Luohe Station also provided great support in terms of manpower and materials.

People's Daily, Changsha, December 13th: Hunan Province's first people-run native railway—the Xinshao County Communist Youth League Railway—after the full-line roadbed construction began on November 5th, successfully completed the track-laying project by December 8th. That afternoon, a native locomotive with a self-weight of 3.5 tons, carrying more than a dozen people, traveled back and forth for a test run, with good results.

This native railway is 12.5 kilometers long, starting from Niangxi (Xinshao County seat, location of the Xinshao Iron Factory) and ending at the Fenshuiao mining area, with a road surface width of three meters and a gauge of 1.435 meters. The entire road was built at a cost of only 1.59 million yuan, which can save about 2 million yuan in transportation costs every year compared to using trucks.

The entire project of this native railway, including surveying, design, construction, felling and transporting sleepers, casting rails, and installing carriages, as well as a series of technical measures and material equipment, was mostly solved by relying on the masses through self-reliance. The county adopted the methods of "finding, training, guiding, and extracting" to address the lack of technical personnel in railway construction. It found six people who had previously built roads to form a technical research group, trained 30 primary school teachers and rural educated youth as technical backbones, and through them, brought out 160 apprentices. In just about ten days, they completed the surveying and design of the entire line, and they divided into sections and groups to contract and guide the construction. The 8,000 rails used for the railway were also successfully cast by workers from six factories including the Xinshao County Machinery Factory using cast iron.

The road-building workers were highly motivated. When there was a shortage of explosives for blasting rocks, they used earth and stones instead; when building bridges, they used stones as bridge piers and wooden boards as bridge decks, and used "three-in-one" soil as cement. When laying tracks, without mobile track layers and mobile levels, they used wooden boards to make fixed gauges and fixed levels. They also created hand-pushed engineering vehicles, which improved work efficiency by 60 times compared to manual transportation. They carried out a total of more than 200 technical innovations, which enabled the road construction project, originally planned to be completed in more than 700,000 labor days, to be completed in only more than 260,000 labor days. Currently, hundreds of migrant workers are rushing to make wooden turntables for the native railway's starting and ending points when returning cars, and repairing loading and unloading platforms. In a few more days, the native train will be fully loaded with ore and directly drive to the iron factory. (Attached picture)

    许昌专区、新邵县群众有志事竟成
    土法土材筑起土铁路
    依靠人民公社力量　建设又快又好又省
    当地工人大力协助　就地培养技术力量
    新华社郑州13日电　河南省许昌专区今年2月开始兴建的一条横跨两县、一市的漯舞土铁路，已于12月10日建成通车。
    漯舞铁路从漯河市的南郊起，经过郾城县至舞阳县的铁山，全长一百二十华里，将漯河、郾城、舞阳、平顶山四个钢铁生产基地与矿藏丰富的铁山、平顶山煤矿以及京广路和沙河航运连接起来。沿线有大小桥涵二十四座，火车站五个。各车站都建有站房、道岔、供水、通信和各种讯号设备。全线现有小机车和轻便机车各两部，车皮三十个，根据设计能力，日运量可达六千吨到八千吨，在修建期间已运输各种物资三千多吨。
    这条铁路是根据客观形势发展的迫切需要兴建的。从去年大跃进以来，漯河到舞阳间的工农业生产发展非常迅速，货运量成倍上升，原来仅有的一条晴通雨阻的公路远远不能满足当时的货运需要，因此，中共许昌地委决定发动群众修建土铁路。
    在修建铁路过程中，中共许昌地委和专区领导部门，采取大搞群众运动和自筹自建的办法，组织民工边备料边修路，使工程进展相当迅速。全线八十万立方米的路基工程和二十四座桥涵，在半个月的时间内就全部建成，质量良好，合乎预期标准。沿线各人民公社还收集了大批废铁和木材，抽出巧工巧匠，就地加工了枕木、道钉和螺丝，保证了铺轨钉道的需要。
    这条铁路的铁轨全部是用生铁铸成的，在开始试制时，由于缺乏经验和设备条件差，铸造出的铁轨有断裂现象。这时有的人说，生铁究竟是生铁，鸡窝里还能飞出凤凰？中共许昌地委根据这种情况，领导工人革新技术，克服这个困难。漯河、商水机械厂的老工人刘得喜和王长太，经过三十多次试验，找到了防止铁轨断裂的办法，铸成的铁轨，经铁道部科学研究所鉴定和多次承受压力的试验，证明质量合乎要求。接着，漯河、许昌、商水等八个机械厂就开始大量生产，满足了铺轨的需要。
    这条铁路在修建中还得到郑州铁路局和漯河车站从人力、物力上给了很大支援。
    本报长沙13日电　湖南省第一条民办土铁路——新邵县共青团铁路从11月5日全线路基开工以后，到12月8日胜利完成了铺轨工程。当天下午，一列自重三点五吨的土火车头载着十余人来回驰骋试车，效果良好。
    这条土铁路全长十二点五公里，起于酿溪（新邵县城、新邵铁厂所在地），止于分水坳矿区，路面宽三米，轨距一点四三五米。全路的建成只花了一百五十九万元，比用汽车运输每年能节约运费约二百万元。
    这条土铁路整个工程的勘测、设计、施工、砍运枕木、铸造铁轨、装车厢等一系列的技术措施和材料设备等问题，大都是依靠群众自力更生解决的。修建铁路缺乏技术力量，县里采取“找、训、带、取”的办法，找了六个曾经修过公路的人组成一个技术研究小组，培训了三十名小学教师和农村知识青年，作为技术骨干，通过他们又带出了一百六十个徒弟。仅十天左右时间就完成了全线的勘测、设计任务，并且由他们分段分组包干，指导施工。铁路所用的八千根铁轨，也是新邵县机械厂等六个厂子的工人，用生铁铸造成功的。
    修路民工们干劲冲天，爆破岩石缺少炸药，就用土石代替；架桥时就用石头做桥墩，木板做桥面，三合土当水泥。铺轨时没有活动铺轨仪和活动水平仪，就用木板制造了固定规尺和固定水平仪。还创造了手推工程车，比人力运输提高工效六十倍。他们一共搞了二百多项技术革新，使原来计划七十多万个劳动日才能完成的筑路工程，只用了二十六万多个劳动日就完成了。目前，几百名民工正在赶制着土铁路起点终点回车时用的木质转盘，和抢修装卸台。再有几天，土火车即将满载矿砂直接开到铁厂。（附图片）
