Anshan, December 20th (By Our Newspaper) – Anshan Iron and Steel Company is intensifying its efforts in raw material production to stockpile sufficient "grain and fodder" for current steel production and next year's continued leap forward. In the first half of this month, compared to late November, the average daily production of concentrated ore powder increased by 23.9%, iron ore by 21.9%, sintered ore by 94%, and coke by 2.2%. Due to the increased supply of raw materials, the daily pig iron production level in the past half-month has increased by 14.9% compared to late November.

In recent years, Anshan Iron and Steel has experienced rapid development in steel production, leading to a relatively tight supply of raw materials. The heavy snow and severe cold in late November brought many production difficulties to open-pit mines and ore dressing and other raw material departments, seriously threatening the normal production of iron and steel. To address this, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee decided to focus all efforts on raw material production, preparing sufficient "grain and fodder" for current production and next year's production. In addition to requiring all factories and mines to launch a mass industrial "drought resistance" campaign to vigorously recover scrap steel and ensure the supply of raw materials for steelmaking, the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee specifically required the raw material departments such as Gongchangling, Dagushan, Donganshan, Sintering, and Chemical to vigorously increase the production of raw materials and fuels and strive to improve quality. More than 70,000 employees in raw material departments such as Gongchangling, Dagushan, Donganshan, Sintering, and Chemical enthusiastically responded to the Party Committee's call, put forward the slogan "Overcome the severe cold and vow to win the high-yield and high-quality winter campaign," and launched a new battle to clear ice and snow, prevent freezing, innovate operations, and overcome key production challenges. According to statistics from six factories and mines in recent days, a total of 487 key production bottlenecks have been broken through, and more than 1,000 new records in various raw material production have been created successively. In response to the key problem of weak heating measures and poor equipment maintenance in the new plant, the workers of the ore dressing workshop of Gongchangling Iron Mine organized a frost prevention commando team, repaired cold protection equipment, rushed to repair frozen water pipes, and strengthened equipment maintenance, which resulted in a steady increase in the output and quality of concentrated ore powder. Recently, the workers of the two magnetic separation sections of Dagushan Iron Mine, in response to the key issue of concentrated ore powder quality, adopted a new operation method of high voltage and low concentration, making the iron content of the concentrated ore powder reach more than 64%, which is about 1% higher than last month. The concentrated ore powder quality of all three ore dressing sections of the mine has averaged completed the plan, and the output has also exceeded the plan by 1,218 tons in the first half of the month. Four deputy directors of the Sintering General Plant also personally went to the front line of production to launch a performance competition among the directors, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of all employees to participate in the performance competition. In the performance, Xu Handing, the deputy director in charge of equipment, mobilized all mechanical and electrical workers to carry out a large performance of equipment maintenance, and restored nine reduction furnaces and solved major key problems such as water mist removal in the ore trough through the performance competition. This plant has already overfulfilled the production plan for sintered ore in the first half of the month, and the quality of sintered ore has also been greatly improved.

The supply of raw materials for Anshan Iron and Steel has also received strong support from brother units in various places and strong cooperation from other departments of Anshan Iron and Steel. Coal mines in Shuangyashan, Hegang and ore dressing plants in Shouwangfen, Hainan Island, etc., overcame various difficulties and transported a large number of concentrated ore powder, coal and other raw materials from afar. The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department launched a campaign to haul more, run faster, load and unload quickly to support the transportation of raw materials to raw material departments such as Gongchangling, Dagushan, Donganshan, Chemical General Plant, and Sintering General Plant, and launched an inter-factory cooperation competition to create conditions for each other and help each other. With the assistance of the transportation department, the Sintering General Plant has now stored 7,000 tons of ore and 20,000 tons of concentrated ore powder in the ore storage tank. The workers of the Sintering General Plant and the Transportation Department are further strengthening cooperation to ensure the timely supply of sintering raw materials and are storing more ore and concentrated ore powder for production at the beginning of next year.

In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient steelmaking raw materials, the workers of dozens of factories and mines such as large rolling mills, cast pipe plants, and scrap iron plants are launching an industrial "drought resistance" campaign to excavate and recycle scrap steel. By the 15th, more than 30,000 tons of scrap steel had been recycled in the first half of the month.

At present, the employees of the raw material department of Anshan Iron and Steel are making every effort to expand the production of raw materials. The two ore dressing workshops of Gongchangling Iron Mine and Donganshan Iron Mine are rushing to build and repair to increase the production of concentrated ore powder. The employees of the raw material department are determined to fight hard for the last ten days and produce more and better sintered ore, ore and coke to ensure the continued leap forward in steel production in Anshan Iron and Steel's current production and the first quarter of next year.

　　七万多职工扫雪，防冻，革新操作，猛攻难关
    鞍钢为明年跃进狠抓原料生产
    本报鞍山20日电　鞍山钢铁公司正在狠抓原料生产，为当前钢铁生产和明年继续跃进备足“粮草”。本月上半月的原料生产同11月下旬比较，平均每天精矿粉增长23.9％，铁矿石增长21.9％，烧结矿增长94％，焦炭增长2.2％。由于原料供应增加，这半个月的生铁日产水平，比11月下旬提高了14.9％。
    鞍钢近几年来钢铁生产发展很快，原料供应比较紧张。11月下旬的大雪和严寒的侵袭，又给各露天作业的矿山和选矿等原料部门带来许多生产上的困难，严重威胁炼铁炼钢的正常生产。为此，中共鞍山市委和鞍钢党委决定全力狠抓原料生产，为当前生产和明年生产准备充足的“粮草”。鞍钢党委除要求各厂矿开展一个群众性的工业“抗旱”运动，大力回收废钢铁，保证炼钢原料供应外，着重要求弓长岭、大孤山、东鞍山、烧结、化工等原料部门大力增产原料和燃料，并努力提高质量。弓长岭、大孤山、东鞍山、烧结、化工等原料部门七万多名职工，热烈响应党委的号召，提出“战胜严寒，誓夺冬季高产优质关”的口号，开展一个清扫冰雪、防御冻结、革新操作、猛攻生产关键的新的战斗。据六个厂矿最近几天统计，共突破生产关键四百八十七个，先后创造一千多项各种原料生产新纪录。弓长岭铁矿选矿车间的职工，针对新厂房采暖措施薄弱、设备维护不好的关键，组织了一个防冻突击队，修补了防寒设备，抢修了冻结水管，加强了设备维修，使精矿粉产量质量蒸蒸日上。大孤山铁矿两个磁选工段的职工，近来针对精矿粉质量关键，采取高电压、低浓度的新操作法，使精矿粉铁份达到64％以上，比上月超过1％左右。全矿三个选矿工段的精矿粉质量平均完成了计划，产量也比上半月计划超产一千二百一十八吨。烧结总厂四名副厂长还亲上生产第一线，展开厂长之间的表演赛，大大鼓舞了全厂职工参加表演赛的积极性。在表演中，设备副厂长徐汉鼎发动全体机电工人开展了设备检修的大表演，通过表演竞赛恢复了九座还原炉和解决了矿槽除水雾等重大关键。这个厂已经超额完成了上半月烧结矿的生产计划，烧结矿的质量也大为提高。
    鞍钢的原料供应，还得到了各地兄弟单位大力支援和鞍钢其他部门大力协作。双鸭山、鹤岗等地的煤矿和寿王坟、海南岛等地选矿厂，克服各种困难，从远地运来大批精矿粉、煤炭和其他原料。鞍钢运输部门的职工展开多拉快跑、抢装抢卸运动，支援弓长岭、大孤山、东鞍山和化工总厂、烧结总厂等原料部门运输原料，并且相互间展开了互创条件、互相帮助的厂际协作竞赛。烧结总厂在运输部门协助下，现在贮矿槽里已贮存了矿石七千吨和精矿粉两万吨。烧结总厂和运输部门两个单位的职工，正在进一步加强协作，保证及时供应烧结原料，并且在为明年年初的生产贮存更多的矿石和精矿粉。
    为战胜炼钢原料不足的困难，大型轧钢厂、铸管厂、碎铁厂等几十个厂矿的职工，正掀起一个工业“抗旱”运动，挖掘和回收废钢铁，到15日止，上半月已回收废钢铁三万多吨。
    现在，鞍钢原料部门的职工正在百般努力扩大原料生产。弓长岭铁矿和东鞍山铁矿两个选矿车间正在抢建抢修，增产精矿粉。原料部门职工决心大战最后十天，生产出更多更好的烧结矿、矿石和焦炭，保证鞍钢当前生产和明年第一季度钢铁生产继续跃进。（附图片）
