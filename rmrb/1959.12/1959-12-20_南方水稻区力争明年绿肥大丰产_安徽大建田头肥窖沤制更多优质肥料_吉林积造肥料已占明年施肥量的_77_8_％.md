Xinhua News Agency report: Southern provinces are strengthening field management of green manure crops, striving for high yields and bumper harvests of green manure next year, which has become an important aspect of the current fertilizer accumulation campaign.

This year, the southern rice area has attached great importance to green manure. The planting area of green manure such as Sesbania, purple clover, and vetch has been greatly expanded compared with last year. Hunan's green manure area has doubled compared with last year, and Zhejiang has expanded by nearly half. Both provinces have completed this year's planting plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. Many areas have also intercropped green manure in winter-planted crop fields. In Pixian County, Sichuan, green manure was planted on winter fallow land, and a lot of green manure was intercropped in winter-planted crop fields. In this way, 85% of the county's cultivated land is planted with green manure.

In order to strive for a green manure harvest and prepare more fertilizer for next year's rice fields, people's communes in various places are strengthening field management of green manure crops. Many people's communes in Jiangsu, Hunan, Zhejiang and other provinces have established specialized green manure cultivation teams. The leading departments in some areas also require that field management of green manure be grasped like that of grain crops, changing the habit of not fertilizing green manure, and striving for high yields per mu. Hunan Province has allocated special chemical fertilizers to green manure fields. Some areas also cover the green manure fields with grass to keep them warm and prevent frost. In Zhejiang Province, all localities have universally mobilized the masses to vigorously grasp the field management of green manure, basically achieving the requirements of early management, diligent management, and careful management, opening ditches for drainage, applying manure fertilizer, and covering grass to prevent frost. In Jiangxi Province, ditches have generally been opened in the entire green manure field, and more than 5.3 million mu of green manure fields have been top-dressed once, and some have been top-dressed twice; a layer of rice straw, bean stalks or cattle manure has been covered on some green manure to keep it warm and prevent frost.

In the management of green manure cultivation, some areas insert red flags, plant experimental fields and high-yield plots, and organize mass-based high-yield competition campaigns.

(Reported from Hefei by our newspaper) Anhui is widely building field-side fertilizer pits for composting fertilizer in accordance with the principles of taking materials locally, composting locally, and applying locally. According to incomplete statistics from the whole province as of the beginning of this month, more than 5.88 million field-side fertilizer pits have been built, most of which have been filled with fertilizer.

There are many benefits to using field-side fertilizer pits to accumulate fertilizer. First of all, it can save a lot of labor. According to a typical survey by the Feixi County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, with field-side fertilizer pits, weeds can be cut from the edge of the fields in spring and summer, and grass skins can be shoveled from the edges of the ridges in autumn and winter, and stalks and leaves of various crops can be collected and composted in all seasons. A pit can compost about 1,200 dan of fertilizer per year. Calculated on the basis of one pit for every three mu, this item alone can apply 400 dan of high-quality fertilizer per mu of field. The more than 100,000 field-side fertilizer pits that the county has built can save more than 1 million labor days for transporting fertilizer alone.

When building field-side fertilizer pits, various places also pay attention to extracting biogas, achieving the purpose of using one thing for two purposes. More than 2 million of the field-side fertilizer pits that have been built throughout the province can be used to extract biogas. In Tongcheng County, the fertilizer pits of various communes near villages are mostly "closed", which can be used for composting fertilizer and extracting biogas all year round. Some people's communes in Fuyang Prefecture build field-side fertilizer pits and field-side pig farms together, combining pig raising, fertilizer composting, biogas, and feed processing. They use field-side fertilizer pits to compost fertilizer and extract biogas, use biogas to process feed for raising pigs, and then use pig manure to compost fertilizer. In this way, they raise pigs, accumulate fertilizer, improve fertilizer efficiency, save labor, and reduce the cost of feed processing, achieving multiple goals with one action.

The widespread establishment of field-side fertilizer pits, which can ferment and mature fertilizers, can improve fertilizer efficiency and kill the eggs of various pests. With field-side fertilizer pits, fertilizer can be accumulated in ordinary times and used in busy times, which also staggers agricultural work and avoids the phenomenon of excessive concentration of agricultural work and insufficient labor allocation. Field-side fertilizer composting and local fertilizer application are also conducive to transforming remote and thin fields. Using various crop straws, leaves, and weeds to compost fertilizer can also improve the soil.

Because there are many benefits to building field-side fertilizer pits for composting fertilizer, the establishment of field-side fertilizer pits has quickly formed a mass movement in Anhui Province.

Xinhua News Agency report: While water conservancy construction is forming a climax in Jilin Province, a fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing campaign has been launched since mid-November. According to statistics on December 10, various fertilizers accumulated and manufactured in the province have accounted for 77.8% of the planned fertilizer application for next year. Among these fertilizers, more than half are peat, human and animal manure, and high-quality and fast-acting fertilizers that have been processed. The quality of other miscellaneous fertilizers has also been improved compared with the past.

This year, various localities in Jilin Province have further consolidated the permanent fertilizer accumulation professional teams, and at the same time established many temporary fertilizer accumulation organizations, forming a mass movement of professional teams making concentrated attacks on large fertilizer sources, and everyone working together to accumulate scattered fertilizers. The fertilizer accumulation professional organizations in Siping and Jilin have established a production responsibility system with dedicated personnel, dedicated horses, dedicated vehicles, and set tasks, set times, set quality, set remuneration, and set leadership. In addition to the fertilizer accumulation professional teams, various localities have also mobilized employees of commune members, institutions and enterprises, and students to participate in dung picking.

People's communes in various localities are grasping fertilizer accumulation with one hand and fertilizer manufacturing with the other. At present, more than 2,900 local chemical fertilizer plants established and restored throughout the province have produced more than 320,000 tons of various local chemical fertilizers. Many communes and teams have established chemical fertilizer plants, and each plant produces local chemical fertilizers. In Changchun, Jilin, Tonghua and other counties with more peat, methods such as smoking, roasting, padding animal pens, or mixing human and animal manure are used to process peat and improve fertilizer efficiency. Most of the 2.9 million tons of fertilizer accumulated in Panshi County are peat or peat over-the-circle fertilizer.

    南方水稻区力争明年绿肥大丰产
    安徽大建田头肥窖沤制更多优质肥料
    吉林积造肥料已占明年施肥量的77.8％
    据新华社讯　南方各省加强绿肥作物的田间管理，争取明年绿肥高产丰产，成了当前积肥运动的一个重要方面。
    今年南方水稻区很重视绿肥，黄花草、紫云英、苕子等绿肥种植面积比去年扩大很多。湖南绿肥面积比去年扩大一倍，浙江扩大近半倍。这两个省都提前超额完成了今年种植计划，不少地区还在冬种作物田间套种了绿肥。四川郫县冬闲地种了绿肥，又在冬种作物田间套种了很多绿肥。这样，全县85％的耕地都种有绿肥。
    为争取绿肥丰收，给明年稻田准备较多的肥料。现在各地人民公社正加强绿肥作物的田间管理。江苏、湖南、浙江等省许多人民公社都成立了绿肥培育专业队。有些地区的领导部门还要求像抓粮食作物一样抓绿肥的田间管理，改变不给绿肥施肥的习惯，争取亩亩高产。湖南省给绿肥田拨了专用化肥。有些地区还在绿肥田中盖草保温防冻。浙江全省各地普遍发动群众大抓绿肥田间管理，基本上达到早管、勤管、细管的要求，分别开沟排水，施粪肥、盖草防冻。江西全省绿肥田一般都开了沟，五百三十多万亩绿肥田已追了一次肥，有的追了两次肥；一部分绿肥已盖上了一层稻草、豆秆或牛栏粪，保温防冻。
    在绿肥培育管理中，有些地区插红旗、种试验田和丰产片，组织群众性的丰产竞赛运动。
    本报合肥电　安徽各地本着就地取材、就地沤制、就地施用的原则，广泛建立田头窖来沤肥。全省到本月上旬不完全统计，已建造田头窖五百八十八万多个，其中大部分都已沤上了肥料。
    利用田头窖积肥的好处很多。首先它可以节省大量的劳动力，据中共肥西县委的典型调查，有了田头窖，春夏砍田边杂草，秋冬铲田埂草皮、扫集各种农作物的茎梗秸叶，四季都可沤肥。一个窖一年可沤肥一千二百担左右，按三亩一窖计算，仅此一项，每亩田就可施优质肥料四百担，这个县已建的十多万个田头窖，单是节省运肥的劳动日就达一百多万个。
    各地在建田头窖时，还注意提取沼气，达到了一物两用的目的。全省已建的田头窖中可以用来提取沼气的就有二百万个以上。桐城县各公社在靠近村庄的肥窖，绝大多数都是“封闭式”的，可常年沤肥，又可取沼气。阜阳专区有些人民公社把田头窖和田头猪场建造在一起，使养猪、沤肥、沼气、加工饲料相结合，利用田头窖沤肥取沼气，用沼气加工饲料养猪，又用猪粪沤肥。这样，既养了猪、积了肥，又提高了肥效，节省了劳力和降低了饲料加工的成本，一举数得。
    普遍建立田头窖，把肥料沤熟发酵，能够提高肥效，杀死各种害虫虫卵。有了田头窖，平时积、忙时用，也错开了农活，避免了农活过分集中、劳力支配不开的现象。田头沤肥，就地施肥，也有利于改造远田薄地。利用各种作物秸梗、树叶杂草沤肥，还能改良土壤。
    由于建造田头窖沤制肥料有许多好处，建立田头窖很快就在安徽全省形成了一个群众运动。
    据新华社讯　吉林省在水利建设形成高潮的同时，11月中旬以来又掀起了积肥造肥运动。据12月10日统计，全省积造的各种肥料已占明年计划施肥量的77.8％。这些肥料中，半数以上是草炭、人畜粪尿和经过加工的高质速效肥料，其余各种杂肥的质量比过去也有提高。
    吉林省各地今年进一步巩固常年积肥专业队，同时成立许多临时性积肥组织，形成专业队突击大宗肥源、大家动手积攒零散肥料的群众运动。四平、吉林两个地区的积肥专业组织，都建立了专人、专马、专车和定任务、定时间、定质量、定报酬、定领导的生产责任制度。除积肥专业队外，各地还发动社员、机关企业的职工、学生参加拣粪。
    各地人民公社一手抓积肥，一手抓造肥。目前全省建立和恢复的两千九百多处土化肥厂，已生产出各种土化肥三十二万多吨。许多公社队队建立化肥厂，厂厂生产土化肥。草炭较多的长春、吉林、通化地区各县，用烟熏、烘炒、垫畜圈或掺拌人粪尿等方法，进行草炭加工，提高肥效。磐石县积出的二百九十万吨肥料中，大部分都是草炭或草炭过圈肥。
