Xinhua News Agency, December 19th dispatch: According to TASS, the Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" wrote in a commentary on the 19th that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Paris shows that this organization is still obsessed with military plans and group mania.

The commentary pointed out that a look at the published communiqué of the Council meeting is enough to convince one that the North Atlantic Alliance continues to play the dangerous trick of an arms race.

The commentary said that although the meeting communiqué stated that "universal and supervised disarmament remains the goal of the West" and that "all possibilities will be used to strive for progress in this regard," everyone knows that the focus of the Paris meeting's work was by no means discussing issues related to disarmament, but rather issues of a completely opposite nature. The participants of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization intend to increase the organization's troops by seven divisions by 1963, and North Atlantic Group Supreme Commander Norstad's suggestion to establish a "fourth atomic power" by handing over atomic weapons to a "multinational atomic agency" composed of all fifteen member states of the North Atlantic Group proves this precisely.

The commentary said that people from all countries cannot help but ask why these Western figures recently supported the joint Soviet-American proposal on disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly, but are now passing resolutions of a completely opposite nature?

Xinhua News Agency, December 19th dispatch: According to TASS, London: The "Daily Worker" wrote in a commentary on the 19th regarding the results of the North Atlantic Group Council meeting: "The only voices heard from Paris this week were about hydrogen bombs, rockets, tanks, and airplanes."

The newspaper continued: "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council insists that its goal is disarmament, but it spent several days discussing how to stockpile more weapons." The newspaper emphasized that the people of the world have been expecting the convening of a (East-West) summit for a long time. However, the enemies of peace are doing their best to delay the convening of such a meeting. At the same time, Western countries are doing everything possible to supply nuclear weapons to West German militarism. The participants of the Paris meeting had differences on some issues, but they were united in arming former Nazis with nuclear weapons and missiles.

The "Daily Worker," in discussing the agenda of the (East-West) summit currently under discussion, pointed out that the status of West Berlin is an urgent and very important issue. The newspaper wrote that if this issue can be resolved at the summit, it will create a starting point for broader agreements between East and West. "However, Adenauer categorically opposes discussing the West Berlin issue. He also hopes that disarmament talks will only begin when West Germany is armed to the teeth, with twelve armored divisions and air force, submarines, atomic weapons..."

Xinhua News Agency, December 19th dispatch: Western newspapers, in commenting on the North Atlantic Group Council meeting held from the 15th to the 17th, all focused on reflecting the fact that the United States is forcing its allies to shoulder more military "obligations" in order to intensify the Cold War, and the resulting sharp contradictions.

Some American newspapers are using a threatening tone to blame their North Atlantic allies for not working hard enough. The "Wall Street Journal" published an editorial on the 15th entitled "The Corrosion of NATO," saying, "The United States believes that its European partners can and should pay more of their own expenses... But Europeans are less willing to contribute more, and their unwillingness reveals the true corrosion within the North Atlantic Organization." The editorial said, "The U.S. government is fully entitled, and indeed responsible to its taxpayers, to insist that Europeans pay for the costs of the treaty organization themselves and otherwise fulfill their obligations as member states." The editorial said, "If some of them refuse, then let them withdraw from the alliance."

The editorial threatened, "The United States can survive without NATO, and Europeans should carefully consider whether they can survive without the United States."

The "New York Times" published an article by Sulzberger on the 16th calling on Eisenhower to rectify the North Atlantic Group. He wrote, "Our great alliance is in a state of disarray. This crisis is not new, but the accumulation of old troubles. People once hoped that the old troubles might ease with the passage of time, but on the contrary, these troubles have surfaced in a nasty way." Sulzberger also blamed France, Belgium, and other countries for failing to meet the goal of thirty divisions for the North Atlantic Group's ground forces, and threatened that the next U.S. administration might cut aid to the North Atlantic Group countries "unless Western Europe increases its contributions as members."

The British "News Chronicle" commented on U.S. Secretary of State Herter's speech at the meeting, saying that the "severity and threatening tone of this speech were no less than Dulles's warnings in his heyday."

The British "Guardian" also pointed out on the 16th that the United States attended the Paris meeting "with one unchanged purpose: to provide (West) European countries with bases for American missiles."

French newspapers continue to express strong dissatisfaction with the United States. From their comments, it can be seen that de Gaulle's French government is not unwilling to engage in an arms race, but rather wants to strive to squeeze into the Western leadership group. "L'Aurore" said on the 18th that there is no question of France changing its diplomacy, "they are simply asking the Americans to remember this: there is only a true alliance between allies with equal rights and responsibilities."

"Le Figaro" said on the 17th that the results of the North Atlantic Group Council meeting show that on the issue of "integration," the United States and France "both stick to their own opinions." "Aujourd'hui Paris" said, "De Gaulle believes that integration should not be limited to obligations, but should extend to decision-making power."

"New York Times" reporter Gruson pointed out that the representatives of Denmark, Norway, and Belgium felt particularly distressed by the United States' demand for increased military "contributions" because their governments would have to ask for increased (military) spending. Gruson quoted the representatives of these countries as saying that they did not believe that "their parliaments would agree to increase defense spending."

### 苏联“消息报”和英国“工人日报”发表评论  北大西洋集团继续玩弄扩军的危险把戏  美国迫使“盟国”承担更多军事义务引起矛盾

　　苏联“消息报”和英国“工人日报”发表评论
    北大西洋集团继续玩弄扩军的危险把戏
    美国迫使“盟国”承担更多军事义务引起矛盾
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联“消息报”19日在评论中写道，在巴黎召开的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议表明，这个组织仍然是军事计划和集团狂的迷恋者。
    评论指出，只要看一看已发表的理事会会议公报就足以相信，北大西洋联盟继续玩弄军备竞赛这种危险的把戏。
    评论说，虽然会议公报说，“普遍和有监督的裁军仍然是西方的目的”，“将利用一切可能性来争取在这方面的进展”。但是，大家都知道，巴黎会议工作的中心决不是讨论同裁军有关的问题，而是讨论性质完全相反的问题。北大西洋公约组织的参加者打算到1963年使这个组织的军队增加七个师，北大西洋集团军队最高司令诺斯塔德建议，通过把原子武器交给北大西洋集团所有十五个成员国组成的“多国家原子机构”来建立“第四原子国”，这就恰恰证明了这一点。
    评论说，各国人民不禁要问，为什么西方国家这些人士不久前在联合国大会上赞成苏美关于裁军问题的联合提案，而现在却通过了性质完全相反的决议？
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：“工人日报”19日在评论北大西洋集团理事会会议的结果时写道：“本周从巴黎听到的唯一的声音是关于氢弹、火箭、坦克和飞机的议论”。
    报纸接着写道：“北大西洋公约组织理事会硬说它的目标是裁军，可是它却花了几天的时间来讨论如何储备更多的武器的问题。”报纸着重指出，全世界人民期望召开（东西方）最高级会议已经很久了。但是和平的敌人却竭力拖延这种会议的召开。同时，西方国家还千方百计地把核武器供给西德军国主义。巴黎会议的参加者之间在某些问题上存在分歧，不过，他们在用核武器和导弹武装前纳粹分子方面却是一致的。
    “工人日报”在谈到现在讨论中的（东西方）最高级会议议程时指出，西柏林地位问题是迫切的，也是非常重要的问题。报纸写道，如果在最高级会议上能够解决这个问题，就会为东西方达成更广泛的协议创造一个开端。“但是，阿登纳断然反对讨论西柏林问题。他还希望只有在西德武装到牙齿、有了十二个装甲师和空军、潜水艇、原子武器……的时候，再开始讨论裁军问题”。
    据新华社19日讯　西方国家报纸在评论15—17日举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议时都集中反映了这样一个事实：美国为加剧冷战而逼迫它的盟国承担更多军事“义务”以及由此而引起的尖锐矛盾。
    一些美国报纸用威胁的口吻责怪它的北大西洋盟国不卖力。“华尔街日报”15日用“北大西洋公约组织的腐蚀”作题目发表社论说，“美国认为，它的欧洲伙伴可以而且应该更多地支付自己的费用……可是欧洲人却不大愿意出更多的力量，他们的不愿意便揭示了北大西洋组织内部真正的腐蚀情况。”社论说，“美国政府完全有权，实际上对它的纳税人也负有责任来坚持，欧洲人自己支付公约组织的费用并在其他方面履行成员国的义务”。社论说，“如果它们中间有人拒绝，那就不妨让它们退出联盟”。
    社论威胁说，“美国没有北大西洋集团也能够生存下去，欧洲人应该好好考虑一下他们没有美国能不能生存”。
    “纽约时报”16日刊登苏兹贝格的一篇文章要艾森豪威尔整顿北大西洋集团。他写道，“我们的大联盟正处于混乱状态。这次危机并不是新的而是老的麻烦积累而成的。人们曾经希望，老的麻烦可能会随着时间的过去而缓和，但是正相反，这些麻烦却令人讨厌地表面化了”。苏兹贝格也责怪法国、比利时等国应对北大西洋集团地面军队没有达到三十个师的目标负责，并且威胁说：美国下届政府可能要削减给北大西洋集团国家的援助，“除非西欧增加它们作为成员国的贡献”。
    英国“新闻纪事报”在评论美国国务卿赫脱在会上的演说时说，这篇演说的“严厉和威胁的程度不下于杜勒斯在全盛时代所作的警告”。
    英国“卫报”16日也指出，美国出席巴黎会议“抱有这样一个一成不变的目的：要（西）欧洲国家为美国的导弹提供基地”。
    法国报纸继续对美国表示强烈不满，从它们的评论中可以看出，戴高乐的法国政府并不是不愿意搞军备竞赛，而是要力争挤入西方的领导集团。“震旦报”18日说，法国不存在改变外交的问题，“他们仅仅要求美国人记住这一点：只有权利和责任平等的盟国之间才有真正的联盟”。
    “费加罗报”17日说，北大西洋集团理事会会议的结果表明，在“一体化”问题上，美国和法国“都坚持自己的意见”。“今日巴黎报”说，“戴高乐认为一体化不只是限于义务方面，而应该扩展到决定权”。
    “纽约时报”记者格鲁森指出，丹麦、挪威和比利时的代表认为美国的增加军事“贡献”的要求使他们特别感到苦恼，因为他们的政府将不得不要求增加（军事）开支。格鲁森援引这些国家代表的话说，他们并不认为，“他们的议会会同意增加国防开支。”
