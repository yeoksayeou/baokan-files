Prioritize Raising Sows, Achieve Great Development in Pig Production
Gushan Commune Establishes Sow Production Base, Increasing Pig Raising Threefold in One Year

(Our report) The Gushan People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan Province, conscientiously summarized and promoted the people's experience of "the lion rolling the embroidered ball" in solving the source of pigs. They vigorously raised sows and practiced self-breeding and self-raising, which enabled the commune's pig-raising industry to develop at a high speed. By the end of November, the commune had more than 17,000 sows in stock, an increase of five and a half times compared with the same period last year; the commune raised more than 80,000 pigs, an average of one pig per mu of land, an increase of more than three times compared with the number in stock at the end of last year; and more than 14,000 fat pigs were sold, an increase of 1.8 times compared with last year. At present, the commune is comprehensively repairing pig farms, adding thatch, installing doors and windows, and sealing cracks to ensure that every sow can safely spend the winter.

The Gushan Commune is located on the banks of the Xiang River, with more than 10,000 households, more than 50,000 people, and more than 70,000 mu of cultivated land. The masses have always had the habit of raising pigs, and the annual income from raising pigs accounts for 43% of the total income. However, in the past, the masses here raised more fat pigs and fewer sows. Therefore, when the commune proposed a plan for great development in pig raising this year, it first encountered the problem of insufficient pig sources. At the end of last year, the commune had only more than 3,000 sows in stock. At that time, they calculated that even if all the piglets born from these sows were kept for self-raising, they would still be short of more than 20,000 pigs to complete the plan of raising 80,000 pigs this year. Where would the piglets come from? In early March, the commune launched a great debate on pig raising. At that time, there were two opinions. A few people advocated buying piglets from other places and opposed the policy of prioritizing the development of sows and self-raising and self-breeding. Their reasons were: self-raising sows would slow down the development speed, affecting the sale of fat pigs; there would be difficulties in pig pens and feed, and the labor force would be too strained. However, the majority of people advocated using the method of self-breeding and self-raising and self-reliance to solve the difficulty of pig sources. They believed that buying more than 20,000 piglets from other places would require more than 200,000 yuan, which was too large an investment; and all places were developing pig raising in large quantities, so there would be money but no market; from the perspective of great development in pig raising, it was necessary to prioritize the development of sows and establish sow production bases. The commune party committee fully supported the policy of self-breeding and self-raising proposed by the majority of people. At the same time, it held on-site meetings in Xitang, Huangtian and other brigades where sows were raised more and pig production developed faster, educating the vast number of cadres and masses with facts. Last year, each household in Xitang Brigade raised more than one sow, and pig production developed rapidly. Now, each household raises an average of more than nine pigs, and sells an average of more than two fat pigs. However, in Longtan Brigade, only one sow was raised for every five households last year. With fewer sows, pig production developed slowly. Now, each household raises an average of only more than one pig, and each household sells less than half a fat pig. Facts have proved that where more sows are raised, pig production develops faster, and more fat pigs are sold.

After the large-scale development of sows, new problems arose: "Who should raise the sows?" A few people representing the interests of wealthy farmers in rural areas launched a large-scale attack on collective sow raising, saying that collective sow raising required more labor, had a low farrowing rate, and a low survival rate, and demanded that sows be decentralized to households for private raising. Some brigades also decentralized a batch of sows to commune members for private raising. After the commune party committee discovered this problem, it immediately organized another large-scale debate within the commune, the center of which was: "Who is better to raise sows? Collective specialized farms and pens? Or private mixed raising according to the old method?" This was also a struggle between two roads in pig raising. In the debate, the broad masses used many vivid facts to compare and prove that collective raising of sows was an important guarantee for the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry. In the great debate, Gaotang Brigade investigated the situation of the 19 sows decentralized to commune members for private raising: In five months, four sows miscarried due to poor management; the 15 sows that had already farrowed averaged only 4.6 piglets per litter, and only half survived; and of the 164 jin of rice allocated to these 19 commune members for feeding, seven households ate it themselves. However, the situation in the collective breeding farm was completely different. Li Guangyao, a breeder at the sow farm in this brigade, raised 25 sows, all of which were pregnant and all survived, with an average of 11.5 piglets per sow per litter.

Through a period of exploration and comparative summary, Gushan Commune came to a basic experience in developing sows: it is necessary to have specialized farms and pens and collective raising to establish sow production bases. This commune has established more than 140 sow farms this year, equipped with professional personnel and professional cadres. At present, 94% of the sows in the commune are raised collectively, and a scientific management system of grouping and penning before conception and single-pen raising after conception is implemented, with full-time cadres in each farm and dedicated personnel responsible for each pen. Detailed inspections are carried out on sows before and after mating, and registration cards are made to ensure timely mating, full pregnancy, full production, and full survival, ensuring the high-speed development of the commune's pig-raising industry.

Experience here proves that while raising sows in large quantities, it is necessary to develop breeding boars accordingly. The best way to solve the contradiction of insufficient breeding boars in large-scale sow raising is to promote scientific artificial insemination. At present, the commune has more than 10,000 sows. If the old method of driving pigs for mating in the past was used, at least more than 500 breeding boars and more than 500 people would be needed to drive the pigs. Now, with the widespread promotion of artificial insemination, the problem of the lack of breeding boars and inseminators in the commune has been solved. This not only greatly reduces the number of breeding boars and personnel, but also facilitates timely mating and the promotion of improved breeds, and the sow farrowing rate is much higher than direct mating.

In order to ensure the quality of sows, the "one-litter appraisal system" has been widely promoted here after the large-scale development of sows to select superior and eliminate inferior breeding sows. That is, after a new sow produces a litter, a comprehensive appraisal is carried out. If it is not suitable as a sow, it is immediately castrated and raised as a meat pig. This not only ensures the quality of the sows, but also helps to complete the task of selling fat pigs. This year, the commune castrated more than 1,000 sows for meat pigs after appraisal. At present, more than 95% of the sows in stock in the commune are improved breeds of local or foreign origin.

In the "four-full" campaign of retaining sows in large quantities and carrying out full mating, full pregnancy, full production, and full survival, the commune party committee conscientiously summarized and promoted the experience of raising sows among the masses, and basically mastered the life habits and estrus and farrowing laws of sows. For example, Li Guiquan, a 50-year-old poor peasant breeder in Gaotang Brigade, mastered the estrus law of sows and adopted the method of "mating in winter and giving birth in spring, mating in summer and giving birth in autumn" to avoid the cold winter and hot summer during the farrowing period of sows. He has raised sows for more than ten years, and all the piglets farrowed by sows have survived. The commune summarized and promoted Li Guiquan's mating experience in raising sows, and the survival rate of piglets has been greatly improved. Hu Xiulian, a well-known outstanding breeder in the commune, has mastered the life habits of "sows need to swim, piglets need to play", and established a piglet "activity field" near the pig farm, implementing grazing on sunny days, eliminating piglet white dysentery, and the piglets grow strong. Piglets that are full two months old weigh 25 kilograms each, which is one-third heavier than ordinary piglets that are full two months old. The commune promptly summarized and promoted this advanced experience and established more than 100 piglet "activity fields". In addition to improving feeding management and strengthening prevention, the incidence of piglet diseases has dropped from the original 5% to 1%. (Attached picture)

　　优先养母猪　猪只大发展
    谷山公社建立母猪生产基地一年养猪增三倍
    本报讯　湖南省长沙县谷山人民公社认真总结和推广了群众中“狮子滚绣球”的解决猪源的经验，大养母猪，自繁自养，使全社养猪事业得到高速度的发展。到11月底，全社存栏母猪一万七千多头，较去年同期增加五倍半；全社养猪八万多头，平均一亩地一头猪，较去年年底存栏数增加三倍多；出栏肥猪一万四千多头，较去年增加一点八倍。现在，全社正在全面修理猪场，加盖稻草，添置门窗，堵塞裂缝，保证头头母猪安全过冬。
    谷山公社在湘江之滨，有一万多户、五万多人口和七万多亩耕地，群众一向有养猪习惯，年年养猪收入占总收入的43％。但是，过去这里的群众养肥猪多，养母猪少。因此今春当公社提出今年养猪大发展的规划时，首先碰到猪源不足的问题。去年年底全社存栏母猪只有三千多头，当时他们计算，这些母猪生的小猪全部留下自养，要完成今年养猪八万头的计划尚差二万多头猪。仔猪从哪里来？3月初全社展开了一场养猪大辩论。当时有两种意见。少数人主张向外地买小猪，反对优先发展母猪和自养自繁的方针。他们的理由是：自己养母猪发展速度慢，影响肥猪出栏；猪栏、饲料有困难，劳力也太紧张。但是大多数人却主张用自繁自养、自力更生的办法来解决猪源困难。他们认为：向外地买二万多头小猪，要二十多万块钱，投资太大；而且各地都在大量发展养猪，有钱无市；从养猪大发展打算，必须优先发展母猪，建立母猪生产基地。公社党委会全力支持了大多数人提出的自繁自养的方针，同时在母猪养得多、猪只发展快的西塘、黄田等大队召开了现场会，用事实教育了广大干部和群众。去年西塘大队每户养母猪一头多，猪只发展快，现在平均每户养猪九头多，出栏肥猪平均每户两头多。而龙潭大队去年每五户才养一头母猪，母猪少，猪只发展慢，现在每户平均养猪只有一头多，每户出栏肥猪不到半头。事实证明：哪里养母猪多，哪里猪只就发展快，出栏肥猪也多。
    母猪大量发展后，又出现了新问题：“母猪由谁来养？”少数代表着农村富裕农民利益的人，大肆攻击集体养母猪，说什么集体养母猪花工多、产仔率低、成活率不高，要求把母猪下放到户，由私人喂养。有些大队也就下放了一批母猪给社员私养。公社党委发现这个问题后，立即在全社范围内又组织了一场大辩论，辩论的中心是：“母猪由谁养好？集体专场专栏养？还是由私人按老办法混合养？”这也是养猪中的两条道路的斗争问题。在辩论中广大群众用许多生动的事实对比，证明了集体喂养母猪是高速度发展养猪事业的重要保证。高塘大队在大辩论中，调查了下放给社员私养的十九头母猪的情况：五个月中，有四头母猪因管理不善流产；已产仔的十五头母猪，平均每窝只下四点六头，活的只有一半；当时发给这十九户社员的一百六十四斤作饲养的稻谷，有七户社员自己吃掉了。可是集体饲养场的情况，就完全不同了。这个大队母猪场饲养员李光耀养的二十五头母猪，头头满怀，头头成活，平均每头母猪每胎产仔十一头半。
    通过一段摸索和对比总结，谷山公社得出一条发展母猪的基本经验：必须专场专栏、集体饲养，建立母猪生产基地。这个社今年已建立一百四十多个母猪场，配备了专业人员和专业干部。目前，全社94％的母猪都由集体饲养，实行受孕前分群分栏、受孕后单栏饲养的科学管理制度，场场有专职干部、栏栏有专人负责。配种前后对母猪有详细检查，并登记卡片，做到适时配种、全孕全产全成活，保证了全社养猪事业的高速度发展。
    这里经验证明：在大养母猪的同时，必须相应地发展种公猪。解决大养母猪中种公猪不足的矛盾，最好的办法是推行科学的人工受精。目前，全社有一万多头母猪，如按过去赶猪交配的老办法，至少要五百多头种公猪、要五百多个人赶脚猪。现在，普遍推广人工受精，全社种公猪和配种员缺乏的问题就解决了。这样，不仅大大减少了种公猪和人员，而且有利于适时配种、推广良种，母猪产仔率比直接交配高得多。
    为了保证母猪质量好，这里在母猪大发展后，普遍推行了“一胎鉴定制”的选优去劣的繁殖良种母猪的办法。就是在新母猪生产一胎后，进行一次全面鉴定，不适宜作母猪的，随即阉作肉猪饲养。这样，既保证了母猪质量好，又有利于完成出栏肥猪的任务。今年全公社经过鉴定后阉作肉猪的母猪有一千多头。现在，全社存栏母猪有95％以上是本地或外地的良种母猪。
    在大留母猪，开展全配、全孕、全产、全活的“四全”运动中，公社党委认真总结和推广了群众中养母猪的经验，基本上掌握了母猪的生活习性和发情产仔规律。例如，高塘大队五十多岁的贫农饲养员李桂泉，掌握了母猪发情规律，采取“冬配春生、夏配秋生”的办法，使母猪产仔期躲过了寒冷的冬天和酷热的夏天。他养母猪十多年，母猪产仔头头成活。公社总结和推广了李桂泉养母猪的配种经验，小猪成活率大大提高了。全社有名的优秀饲养员胡秀莲，掌握了“母猪要泅，小猪要游”的生活习性，在猪场附近建立小猪“活动场”，实行晴天放牧，消灭了小猪白痢病，小猪长得健壮，满双月的小猪每头有二十五斤重，比一般满双月的小猪重三分之一。公社及时总结和推广了这一先进经验，建立了一百多个小猪“活动场”，加上改善饲养管理和加强预防工作，小猪发病率由原来的5％下降到1％。（附图片）
