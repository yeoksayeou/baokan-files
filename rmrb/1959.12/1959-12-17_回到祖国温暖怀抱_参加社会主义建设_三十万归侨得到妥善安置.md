Xinhua News Agency, 16th: This reporter has learned from relevant sources that since liberation, 300,000 overseas Chinese have returned to the country. Their work and lives have been properly arranged.

The People's Government has consistently warmly welcomed overseas Chinese to return to the country and participate in the great cause of socialist construction.

The overseas Chinese are warmly received by the People's Government and relevant departments as soon as they set foot on the threshold of their motherland. Poor returned overseas Chinese or refugees are provided with free board and lodging, cotton clothes and quilts, subsidized travel expenses, and assisted in returning to their hometowns to participate in production. For returned overseas Chinese seeking employment, the relevant departments, based on the policy of "treating everyone equally and giving appropriate consideration" and the principles of resettlement based on origin, primarily serving rural areas, and employing skilled personnel according to their abilities, quickly and properly arrange for them to participate in production or work in rural areas, factories, enterprises, and cultural, educational, health, transportation, and other departments. Technical personnel, doctors, scientists, and other senior intellectuals among the returned overseas Chinese, as well as those with experience and skills in cultivating tropical and subtropical crops, are given priority by relevant departments in being assigned to positions where they can fully utilize their talents.

In order to resettle poor returned overseas Chinese who have no homes or relatives to turn to, the People's Government has established eight large-scale state-owned overseas Chinese farms in Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi. In recent years, more than 14,000 returned overseas Chinese, and some of the overseas Chinese who were recently forced to return from Indonesia, have settled on the farms and engaged in production. For elderly returned overseas Chinese with no support, the relevant departments arrange for them to live in homes for the elderly according to their wishes. In Taishan County, Guangdong Province alone, there are more than 300 elderly returned overseas Chinese with no support who are spending their happy later years in homes for the elderly.

    回到祖国温暖怀抱　参加社会主义建设
    三十万归侨得到妥善安置
    新华社16日讯　本社记者从有关方面获悉：解放以来先后回国的华侨有三十万人。他们的工作和生活都得到妥善的安置。
    人民政府一贯地热情欢迎海外华侨回国参加伟大的社会主义建设事业。
    海外华侨一踏上祖国的大门，就受到人民政府和有关部门的热情接待。对贫苦的归侨或难侨，免费供给膳宿，发给棉衣、棉被，资助车船费，协助他们回乡参加生产。对要求就业的归侨，有关部门根据“一视同仁、适当照顾”的政策，和按籍安置、主要面向农村、有技能者量才录用的原则，迅速妥善地分别安置他们到农村、工厂、企业以及文教、卫生、交通、运输等部门参加生产或工作。归侨中的技术人员、医生、科学家等高级知识分子，和在垦植热带、亚热带作物方面有经验和技术的人材，有关部门都优先地安排他们到能够充分发挥他们才能的岗位上去。
    为了安置无家可归、无亲可投的贫苦归侨，人民政府在广东、福建、广西创办了八个规模宏大的国营华侨农场。几年来有一万四千多名归国华侨，和最近被迫从印度尼西亚归来的一部分华侨，在农场落户，从事生产。对于年老无依靠的归侨，有关部门则根据他们的意愿，安置到敬老院里养老。仅广东省台山县就有三百多位年老没有依靠的归侨，在敬老院安度幸福的晚年。（附图片）
