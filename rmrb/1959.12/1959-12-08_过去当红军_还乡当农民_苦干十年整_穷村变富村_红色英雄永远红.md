    Former Red Army Soldier Returns Home as a Farmer, Ten Years of Hard Work Transforms a Poor Village into a Prosperous One: A Red Hero is Forever Red
    By Our Correspondents Jiang Wenpin and Zhu Yuemei
    At the recent Shandong Province Conference of Activists among Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Disabled, Demobilized, Transferred, and Retired Soldiers, a delegate named Xiong Jiafeng was hailed as the "Evergreen Pine" of an old hero. He was originally a veteran Red Army soldier who returned home to be a farmer for ten years, leading the members of his cooperative and production team in making valuable contributions to changing the backward conditions of the mountainous area.
    Xiong Jiafeng is now the Party General Branch Secretary of Wangjiazhuang Production Brigade, Xiawei People's Commune, Yishui County. He joined the Red Army in 1932, became a member of the Communist Party in 1933, and is now fifty-seven years old. He participated in the Long March, climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed the grasslands, was wounded three times, and received two citations for merit. After the national liberation in 1949, he held a leadership position at the regimental level. To care for his weakened body, the higher authorities decided to grant him long-term convalescence. He said, "I am not that old yet, and I cannot let the state support me for nothing for the rest of my life. Please, Party, approve my return to my hometown to farm." To ensure his safety and well-being, the Party provided him with a horse, two guns, and a soldier to take care of him. He thought, "I am returning home to engage in production. Carrying guns, a horse, and a guard would increase the state's expenses and separate me from the masses." As soon as he arrived home, he handed over the guns and horse to the government and sent the seventeen-year-old guard, Liu Ying, to school. When he had nurtured Liu Ying to graduate from middle school, he mobilized Liu Ying to return home to work diligently.
    "The true color of the old Red Army soldier hasn't changed!" The elders in the village all commented on Xiong Jiafeng. After returning to his hometown, he supported his seventy-year-old mother and provided for Liu Ying's schooling through his own labor. Although life was difficult, he never complained. Although he was entitled to the relief funds allocated by the government each time, he never accepted them once. He often said, "I cannot contribute to the country, and if I also accept relief from the state, my conscience will be uneasy." He has always been loyal to the cause of the Party. From the initial mutual aid teams to the people's commune last year, he played an active role in propaganda, organization, and leadership. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, which began with mountain and river management in the winter of 1957, this old hero has shown his heroic qualities even more.
    Wangjiazhuang is surrounded by poor, barren mountains. When Xiong Jiafeng was young, he worked for landlords with his grandfather and father, tilling the land and had traversed every mountain around. He loved these mountains, but also shared the suffering of the poor mountains and bad waters with his fellow villagers. In the winter of 1957, Wangjiazhuang was still an agricultural cooperative, and he served as the Party branch secretary of this cooperative. When the higher authorities put forward the call to advance towards the poor mountains and bad waters and change the face of the mountainous area, he excitedly ran up the mountains time and again to observe and ponder, and visited elderly people familiar with the mountains. To prevent soil erosion and overcome drought, the most important thing was to build a reservoir at the foot of the mountain. Xiong Jiafeng widely solicited the opinions of the cooperative members while also requesting instructions from the township Party committee. The Party committee secretary came with a surveying team to re-examine the plan, and they believed that Xiong Jiafeng's mountain management plan was appropriate and thorough, so they approved it. Thus, the entire cooperative was divided into three groups: the deputy secretary led five hundred people up the mountain to manage the mountain, the cooperative director led three hundred people to build the reservoir, and Xiong Jiafeng led the fertilizer accumulation team to vigorously accumulate fertilizer. At that time, Xiong Jiafeng and twelve production team leaders made a pledge: he guaranteed to supply 10,000 catties of fertilizer per mu, and the production team leaders guaranteed a yield of 1,000 catties of grain per mu!
    Xiong Jiafeng received the task and went home. He didn't sleep the first night, and the second night he sat in the shadows, smoking incessantly, pondering how to complete the task. Ten thousand catties of fertilizer per mu, but even if all the manure in the village's dung pits were carried out, it would only amount to 1,500 catties per mu. His wife reminded him, "If there isn't enough manure, can't you dig the bottom of the pit?" This sentence enlightened him. He thought, "The bottom of the pit can be dug, can the courtyard also be dug?" Before dawn, he started digging in his own courtyard. The courtyard hadn't had its soil changed for hundreds of years, and chicken and duck droppings had accumulated inside. He picked it up and smelled it – it was fishy and smelly. He happily opened the door and led the fertilizer accumulation team to dig out more than a thousand loads of fertilizer. After digging up the courtyards of the cooperative cadres, they dug up the courtyards of the cooperative members, replacing all the courtyard soil with new soil. This both accumulated fertilizer and improved environmental hygiene.
    On the first day of accumulating fertilizer, Xiong Jiafeng took the lead in carrying soil. The team members refused, saying that he was too old with his long beard, and that just running would be enough. The next day, he rushed to carry it again, and the team members said the same thing. On the third day, he simply shaved his beard clean and said to the young men with a smile, "How about it, am I not like eighteen years old too?" The team members were moved and amused at the same time. In a few days, piles of fertilizer accumulated like mountains inside and outside the village. Later, 10,000 catties of fertilizer were applied to each mu, and some good fields in front of and behind the village even had 30,000 to 40,000 catties applied.
    After accumulating fertilizer, this man with a strong will went to manage the mountains. In the depths of winter, when snowflakes were falling, he led the cooperative members down the mountain and joined the large army building the reservoir, building the reservoir together. At that time, some people suggested that since the winter snow had fallen and it was cold, should they wait until after the Spring Festival to build it.
    "Low morale is not conducive to completing the task." After Xiong Jiafeng discerned this sentiment, he immediately suggested taking a break. More than eight hundred people sat together, and he stood up and said he was going to tell a story. Everyone wanted him to tell a story about the Long March. He told the story. He said, "Perhaps only one or two people here know how I went out to become a soldier that day. My family begged for three generations and suffered the exploitation and oppression of the landlords. Life was really unbearable, so I begged my way to Jiangxi and joined the Red Army. During the Long March, the Red Army went through all kinds of hardships. When the unit I was in reached a large mountain in the Northwest, it was exactly November 20th. The troops were wearing single layers of clothing and fought with the enemy for three days and three nights, annihilating an enemy division. At that time, the troops only ate one meal every three days and didn't complain about being hungry, and they were wearing single layers of clothing and fighting the enemy without complaining about the cold. We are building a new China, eating two hot meals a day, wearing cotton-padded trousers and coats to build a reservoir, and complaining when we encounter a few snowflakes. Is that the right way to think?"
    After everyone discussed it, recalling the past suffering and the happiness the Party had given them after liberation, half of the eight hundred people cried. They said that even if it snowed this winter, they would build this reservoir; not only would they work harder during the day, but they would also light lamps to work at night. From then on, they worked in alternating shifts day and night. On the twenty-third night of work, Xiong Jiafeng felt a little unwell. The cooperative director advised him to go home and rest. He said, "I was wounded twice in one day during the battle in Yuwangbao and still didn't leave the battlefield. Now, working here, I've sweated a little and caught a cold, and I'm going to withdraw from the battle? What kind of Communist Party member is that!" He persisted until the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, when the reservoir was basically built, before he and everyone else stopped working.
    Just after the Spring Festival, this old hero led eight hundred people back to the top of the mountain and, in eighty-four days, managed seven mountain peaks, reclaimed 1,100 mu of wasteland, and achieved the third great victory!
    In 1958, he continued to follow the instructions of the Party, leading the whole cooperative to vigorously grasp water, fertilizer, and soil, and achieved an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture, turning a poor mountain valley into a prosperous village, and for the first time changing from a grain-deficient team to a grain-surplus team.
    In 1959, a year of continued leaps forward, Xiong Jiafeng led his production brigade to use the newly built reservoirs, wells, springs, and regulated rivers to overcome the fifty-three-day drought and, in the barren mountain land, achieved an average yield of 832 catties of grain per mu, further changing the face of the mountainous area.
    Xiong Jiafeng has been home for ten years and is highly praised in his hometown. In 1958 alone, the production brigade he led won sixteen award banners and certificates, and he personally became a first-class hero in iron smelting. In 1959, he attended the National Conference of Activists among Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Disabled, Demobilized, Transferred, and Retired Soldiers, and his heroic deeds are deeply engraved in people's hearts.

    过去当红军　还乡当农民　苦干十年整　穷村变富村
    红色英雄永远红
    本报记者　姜文品　朱曰梅
    在最近召开的山东省烈军属和残废、复员、转业、退伍军人积极分子会议上，有位代表叫熊家凤，被人们称为“不老松”的老英雄。他原是老红军，回家当农民十年，领导本社、本队的社员，为改变山区落后的面貌，作出了可贵的贡献。
    熊家凤，现在是中共沂水县夏蔚人民公社王家庄生产大队党总支书记。1932年参加红军，1933年加入共产党，今年五十七岁了。他经过长征，爬过雪山草地，负过三次伤，立过两次功。1949年全国解放后，他已担任团一级的领导职务，上级为了照顾他那残弱的身体，决定让他长期休养。他说：“我的年纪不算老，不能让国家白白养活我一辈子，请党批准我回乡种地吧。”党为了他的安全和生活，给了他一匹马、两支枪，派了一名战士照顾他。他想，我是回家生产的，带着枪、马和警卫员，会增加国家开支和脱离群众。他一到家，就把枪和马交给政府，把十七岁的警卫员刘英，送到学校读书。当他把刘英培养到中学毕业的时候，就动员刘英回家去好好工作。
    “老红军的本色没变呵！”村上的父老都这样谈论着熊家凤。他回乡以后，靠自己劳动，养活着七旬的老母和供给刘英上学。生活虽然困难，但从未吐露过。政府每次拨下的救济款虽然都有他的份，他一次没有接受。他常说：“我不能为国出力，再让国家救济，于心不安。”他对党的事业一直是忠心耿耿。从最初的互助组，到去年的人民公社，他都起了积极地宣传、组织和领导作用。尤其是从1957年冬由治山治水开始的大跃进以来，这位老英雄更显示出他的英雄本色。
    王家庄，四面被穷山秃岭环绕。年轻时的熊家凤和祖父、父亲一起给地主种地时，曾踏遍了周围的每个山头。他热爱这些山，同时也和乡亲们一起吃过穷山恶水的苦头。1957年冬，王家庄还是一个农业社，他担任了这个社的党支部书记。当上级提出了向穷山恶水进军、改变山区面貌的号召时，他兴奋得一次又一次地跑上山去观察、琢磨，拜访熟悉山地的老人。为了免除水土流失和战胜旱灾，最重要的是在山脚下筑起一座水库。熊家凤一面广泛征求社员的意见，一面请示乡党委。党委书记带着一个勘察队来复察，认为熊家凤的治山计划妥善而周密，批准了。于是全社兵分三路，副支书率领五百人上山治山，社长率领三百人修建水库，熊家凤率领积肥队大搞积肥。当时熊家凤和十二个生产队长挑了战：他保证每亩供应万斤肥，各生产队长保证亩产千斤粮！
    熊家凤领受任务回家，第一夜没睡觉，第二夜又坐在黑影里不停地抽烟，琢磨着怎样完成任务。亩施万斤肥，可是全村粪圈里的粪都抬出来，每亩也不过一千五百斤啊。他妻子提醒他说：粪不够，不好挖圈底吗？这一句话给他开了窍。他想：圈底可挖，天井（院子）也可挖？没等天明，他就在自家天井里刨开了。几百年的天井没换土、鸡屎鸭粪都积在里面。他捧起一嗅，腥臭。他乐得敞开大门，领着积肥队，挖出一千多挑肥。挖完社干部的天井，又挖社员的天井，把天井全换上新土。既积了肥，又改善了环境卫生。
    在积肥头一天，熊家凤带头挑土，队员不肯，说他胡子老长，光跑也够呛。第二天他又抢着挑，社员又是那套话。第三天他索性把胡须剃得净光，到小伙子跟前笑着说：“怎么样，我是不是也和十八岁一样啦？”社员们一看，又感动，又好笑。不几天，庄里庄外，肥料堆积成山。后来，每亩地施肥万斤，庄前庄后的好田还有施三四万斤的。
    这位意志旺盛的老人，积完肥就又去治山，深冬了，雪花纷飞的时候，他才领着社员下山，与修建水库的大军会师，共建水库。当时，有人提议，冬雪降地，天寒手冷，是不是过了春节再修。
    “士气不高，对完成任务不利”。熊家凤洞察出这一情绪后，立即建议休息一下。八百多人围坐一起，他站立起来，说要拉个故事。大家要他讲长征故事。他依题讲了起来。他说：“我当日怎样出去当的兵，在座的要怕只有一、二十个人知道。我家要了三辈子饭，受尽了地主的剥削压迫，实在生活不下去了，我讨着饭奔到江西，参加了红军。红军长征时，历尽千辛万苦。我所在的那支部队到了大西北一座大山上的时候，正是11月20日，部队穿着单衣，与敌人作战三天三夜，歼灭敌人一个师。那时部队三天只吃一顿饭不说饿，穿着单衣与敌人作战不说冷。咱们为了建设新中国，一天吃着两顿热饭，穿着棉裤棉袄修水库，碰上几片片雪花就叫苦，这样想对吗？”
    大家一讨论，回忆起过去的痛苦和解放后党给的幸福，八百人中哭了一半。他们表示，别说下一场雪，就是今冬天天下雪也要修起这座水库；不但白天加劲干，晚上也要掌起灯来干。从此，白天晚上分班交替着干起来了。熊家凤干到第二十三个夜晚，身体有些不舒服。社长劝他回家休息。他说：“我在豫旺堡作战一天挂了两次彩，还没离开阵地。在这里干活淌了点汗，受点感冒，就退出战斗，那算什么共产党员。”他一直坚持到腊月二十八，基本上修起了水库，才和大家一起收了工。
    刚过了春节，这位老英雄又带上八百人返回山顶，先后用了八十四天，治好了七座山头，开荒一千一百亩，获得第三次大捷！
    1958年，他继续按照党的指示，领导全社大抓水、肥、土，获得了农业全面大丰收，使穷山沟出现了富裕村，第一次由缺粮队变为余粮队。
    继续跃进的1959年，熊家凤领导自己的生产大队，利用建好的水库、水井、泉子和闸好的河流，战胜了五十三天的大旱，在瘠薄的山地，取得了平均亩产八百三十二斤粮的丰收，进一步改变了山区面貌。
    熊家凤回乡十年，誉满乡里。仅1958年，他领导的生产大队，就获得十六面奖旗和奖状，个人当了炼铁的一等功臣。1959年，他出席了全国烈军属和残废、复员、转业退伍军人积极分子会议，他的英雄事迹深深留在人们的心里。（附图片）
