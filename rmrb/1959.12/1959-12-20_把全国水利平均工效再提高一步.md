Editorial: Further Increase the National Average Efficiency of Water Conservancy Projects

On November 28th, this newspaper, in its editorial "Plant the Red Flag of High Efficiency All Over Water Conservancy Construction Sites," proposed that the high-efficiency movement being carried out at water conservancy construction sites across the country had the potential to increase the national average efficiency by 30%-50% from its existing base. Now, only half a month later, the national average efficiency has already increased to more than three cubic meters of earthwork (i.e., the amount of earthwork completed by one laborer in one day). The average efficiency in Anhui Province has reached more than nine cubic meters, and in Henan and Gansu it has exceeded six cubic meters. In advanced regions and construction sites where the efficiency was already very high, the average efficiency continues to increase; the average efficiency in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, has increased sevenfold compared to the same period last year, reaching more than twelve cubic meters, and Shishou County in Hubei Province, which originally had ten cubic meters, now has eighteen point three cubic meters. These situations powerfully demonstrate that it is not only entirely possible to increase the average efficiency of water conservancy construction sites across the country by 30%-50% from the existing base, but it can also be greatly exceeded. This is a major victory for the high-efficiency movement in water conservancy construction.

The current situation is that, although the national average efficiency has been continuously improving, it is still far behind the average efficiency of advanced construction sites. The distance between the advanced level and the backward level reflects the enormous potential of water conservancy construction sites across the country. It is necessary to tap this potential as soon as possible and shorten the distance. All water conservancy construction sites across the country should learn from advanced construction sites and strive to enable each water conservancy construction site to reach the advanced level this winter and next spring. The new task facing each water conservancy construction site is to do everything possible to increase the average efficiency by 50% or even more from the current base of three cubic meters. The situation in Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces proves that this is entirely possible. The key lies in the combination of hard work, practical work, and clever work, in vigorously carrying out technological innovation, vigorously reforming tools, and vigorously carrying out mass movements. The reason why the average efficiency in Anhui Province has increased so rapidly is because a surge of water control tool reform has been launched. According to statistics from early October to mid-November, the province reformed more than 1.8 million sets of various large and small tools, basically eliminating or greatly reducing the phenomenon of manual carrying. The reason why the famous Zhang Youdao Youth Shock Team in this province was able to increase the average efficiency from 21.2 cubic meters to 31.3 cubic meters is mainly due to the comprehensive and continuous reform of water control tools. Taking earth transportation as an example, in the past, people carried it, and one person could only transport a few cubic meters a day. After using a pulley with a crossbar, each person could transport an average of more than forty cubic meters. At the same time, the tools that have already been reformed are continuously improved to make them more perfect and more efficient. For example, for the dustpan-style pulley, they made thirty improvements one after another, and the daily efficiency also increased from 40.2 cubic meters on the first day of construction to 51 cubic meters. These situations show that only by going all out, advocating clever work, and not just relying on increasing labor intensity, can we increase the daily efficiency of water conservancy construction sites more, faster, better, and more economically. Such an approach is the most fundamental and reliable guarantee for completing and overfulfilling the water conservancy tasks for this winter and next spring.

Each construction site should adhere to comprehensive and continuous technological innovation and tool reform. It is necessary to mobilize everyone on the construction site to use their brains, think of ideas, and do everything possible to improve efficiency. Every process and every type of work must be reformed. Only by comprehensively reforming each process such as digging, loading, transporting, unloading, and compacting, can the progress of the entire project be accelerated and the entire construction site reach an advanced level. Of course, the reform of each process and each type of work cannot be started and completed at the same time, there will still be priorities. However, as long as each construction site grasps the main processes and key links in the project for reform, and immediately grasps other connected links to promote the timely catching up of technological innovation in other links, the progress of the entire project will be accelerated and the quality of the project will also be improved. Technological innovation should also be extended to the logistics department, such as the supply department of materials and equipment and the welfare department of life. They should also find ways to reform tools, promote new technologies, save manpower, and improve efficiency. It should be seen that tool reform, large-scale reform, will greatly improve efficiency; small-scale reform will slightly improve efficiency; no reform will not improve efficiency, or will improve it very little; comprehensive reform will comprehensively improve efficiency, and continuous reform will continuously improve efficiency. Therefore, our policy is not small reform, but large reform, not individual reform, but comprehensive reform, not only one reform, but continuous reform.

One of the reasons why the efficiency of many construction sites is lower than the efficiency of advanced construction sites is that some of the advanced tools created by advanced construction sites have not been universally promoted in general construction sites. This situation must be changed. It is of course very good for each construction site to invent and create new tools according to the conditions of its own construction site, but it is also necessary to promote and use the new tools invented and created by other construction sites according to the conditions of its own region. The Beijing Water Conservancy Construction Site proposed two methods: "sending treasures" and "seeking scriptures." "Sending treasures" is for advanced units to send their advanced tools and advanced experiences to various construction sites, and perform on the spot to teach their experiences to others. The "Flying Tiger" Youth Shock Team of Haizi Reservoir in Beijing originally relied on hard work to push carts to transport earth. After the Beijing Water Conservancy Observation Group introduced them to the advanced experience of pushing carts, they immediately started to modify the carts and improve the methods, and the efficiency increased fourfold at once. "Seeking scriptures" means going to brother construction sites to learn advanced experience and promote and use it on their own construction sites. The Party Committee of Meiling Reservoir Construction Site in Shangyou, Jiangxi, sent someone to brother construction sites to learn the experience of blasting earth, automatic unloading, etc., and immediately promoted it after returning. In less than twenty days, high-speed construction was achieved. Such emphasis on promoting advanced tools and learning advanced experience is completely correct and worthy of vigorous promotion.

After the tool reform, the most important issue is to improve the operational technical level of each person. All tools need people to operate in order to function. The higher the level of proficiency in operating technology, the greater the role of the tool. The reason why the average efficiency of the Zhang Youdao Shock Team in Anhui was able to increase to thirty-one cubic meters is because their operating technology has been continuously improving. Therefore, while promoting advanced tools, it is necessary to promote advanced operating methods. Promoting advanced operating methods should be one of the important contents of technological innovation.

Technological innovation and tool reform on a large scale require some equipment and materials. Where do these things come from? Some people advocate asking the state, asking the higher authorities; others advocate self-reliance and relying on the power of the masses to solve it. The state actively supports water conservancy construction, but due to the limited number of materials and equipment, it can only supply them in a focused manner. Most projects still have to rely on local self-reliance and mobilizing the masses to solve them. The Yanhuiqu Canal Construction Site in Shaanxi originally lacked technical personnel, so they opened schools to train the various types of technical personnel they needed; they lacked construction materials such as cement and gunpowder, so they set up factories to manufacture cement, gunpowder, and so on. This not only met their own needs, but also had a surplus to support other brother units. Because they ran their own factories, used local materials, manufactured locally, and used locally, they greatly reduced the cost of the project, saving the country more than 700,000 yuan, accounting for half of the original total investment of the project, and greatly shortened the construction period. The Yanhuiqu Canal, which was originally scheduled to be completed next winter, is expected to be completed ahead of schedule. The facts of the Yanhuiqu Canal vividly and powerfully prove that relying on the masses and self-reliance to solve water conservancy materials is an important way to build water conservancy projects more, faster, better, and more economically.

To carry out technological innovation and tool reform on a large scale, so that general construction sites can reach the level of advanced construction sites, it is necessary to further strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, thoroughly criticize right-leaning tendencies, go all out, and carry out mass movements on a large scale. As long as any place does this, it will be able to greatly improve efficiency and push the high-efficiency movement of water conservancy construction to a new and greater climax.

### 把全国水利平均工效再提高一步

    把全国水利平均工效再提高一步
    11月28日，本报在“把高工效的红旗插遍水利工地”的社论中曾经提出，全国水利建设工地开展的高工效运动有可能把全国平均工效从已有基础上提高30％—50％。如今，时间仅仅相隔半月，全国平均工效已经提高到三土方（即一个劳动力一天完成的土方工程）以上。安徽省的平均工效已达到九方以上，河南、甘肃超过六方。原来工效已经很高的先进地区、先进工地，平均工效仍在继续提高；安徽阜阳专区平均工效比去年同期提高七倍达到十二方以上，湖北石首县原来是十方，现在是十八点三方。这些情况有力地说明了：全国水利工地普遍从现有基础上提高工效30％—50％，不但完全能够实现，而且可以大大超过。这是水利建设高工效运动的一个重大胜利。
    目前的情况是，全国平均工效，虽然已经不断提高，但是和先进工地的平均工效比较起来，却还远落在后边。先进水平与后进水平之间的距离，反映出全国水利工地有着极大的潜力。必须尽快地挖掘潜力，缩短距离。全国水利工地都要向先进工地看齐，争取在今冬明春使每个水利工地都能达到先进的水平。摆在各个水利工地面前的新的任务，就是要千方百计地把平均工效从现在的三方的基础上，再提高50％甚至更多一点。安徽、江西等省的情况证明，这是完全可能的。关键在于苦干实干和巧干的结合，在于大搞技术革新，大搞改革工具，大搞群众运动。安徽省平均工效所以提高得如此之快，就因为掀起了治水工具改革的热潮。根据10月上旬到11月中旬的统计，这个省共改革了各种大小工具一百八十多万套，基本上消灭了或者大大减少了人力担挑的现象。这个省的著名的张友道青年突击队所以能把平均工效从二十一点二立方米提高到三十一点三立方米，主要是由于全面地不断地改革了治水工具。以运土来说，过去人担，一人一天只能运几方，改用穿挡滑车以后，每人平均可以运四十多方。同时，对已经改革过的工具，继续加以改进，使它更加完善，效率更高。例如对于簸箕式滑车，他们先后作了三十次改进，日工效也就从开工的第一天的四十点二立方米提高到五十一立方米。这些情况说明了：只有鼓足干劲，提倡巧干，而不是仅仅依靠增加劳动强度，才能多快好省地提高水利工地的日工效。这样的作法是完成和超额完成今冬明春水利任务的最根本、最可靠的保证。
    每个工地，应当坚持全面地不断地技术革新和工具改革。要发动工地上所有的人都来动脑筋，想计策，千方百计提高工效。每个工序、每个工种都要进行改革。只有挖、装、运、卸、压等各个工序全面革新，才能加快整个工程的进展，使整个工地达到先进水平。当然，各个工序、各个工种的改革不可能同时动手同时完成，还是会有先有后的。但是，只要每个工地在抓住了工程中的主要工序、主要环节进行改革之后，立即抓住其他相连的环节，促使其他环节的技术革新及时赶上，整个工程进度就会加速，工程质量也会提高。技术革新还应当扩大到后勤部门，如物资器材的供应部门和生活福利部门也要多方设法改革工具，推广新技术，节省人力，提高效率。应当看到，工具改革，大改革，工效就大提高；小改革，工效就小提高；不改革，工效就不能提高，或提高得极少；全面地改革，工效就全面地提高，不断地改革，工效就不断地提高。因此，我们的方针不是小改，而是大改，不是个别地改，而是全面地改，不是只改一次，而是不断地改。
    许多工地的工效所以低于先进工地的工效，原因之一，就是先进工地所创造的一些先进工具，还没有在一般工地普遍推广。这种情况必须加以改变。各个工地能够根据自己工地的情况，发明创造新式工具，当然很好，但是，根据自己地区的情况，推广使用别的工地创造发明的新式工具，同样也是必要的。北京水利工地提出了“送宝”“取经”两个方法。“送宝”是由先进单位把自己的先进工具、先进经验，送到各个工地，并且当场表演，把经验传授给别人。北京海子水库的“飞虎”青年突击队，原来推车运土只靠苦干。北京市水利观摩团向他们介绍了推车的先进经验以后，他们立刻动手改装车子，改进方法，工效一下提高了四倍。“取经”就是到兄弟工地学习先进经验，在自己工地推广、使用。江西上犹的梅岭水库工地党委派专人到兄弟工地学习爆破取土，自动卸土等经验，回来立即推广，前后不到二十天时间，实现了高速度施工。这样重视推广先进工具、学习先进经验是完全正确的，值得大力提倡。
    工具改革以后，最重要的问题是提高每一个人操作技术水平。一切工具都需要人去操作，才能发挥作用。操作技术的熟练程度愈高，工具发挥的作用就愈大。安徽张友道突击队平均工效所以能够提高到三十一方，就是因为他们的操作技术不断地提高。因此，在推广先进工具的同时，要推广先进的操作方法。推广先进操作方法，应当是技术革新重要内容之一。
    大闹技术革新和工具改革，需要一些器材和物资，这些东西从哪里来？一种人主张向国家要，向上级要；一种人主张自力更生，依靠群众力量来解决。国家对水利建设是积极支持的，但是由于物资器材数量有限，只能有重点地供应。大多数工程还得依靠各地自力更生、发动群众来解决。陕西延惠渠工地原来缺乏技术人员，他们就开办学校，训练自己需要的各类技术人员；缺乏水泥、火药等建设器材，他们就大办制造水泥、火药等等的工厂。这样不仅满足了自己的需要，而且还有多余，支援别的兄弟单位。由于他们自办工厂，就地取材，就地制造，就地使用，大大降低了工程成本，为国家节省了七十多万元，占工程原设计总投资的一半，还大大缩短了工期，本来明年冬天才能完工的延惠渠，预计将可以提前完成。延惠渠的事实生动有力地证明：依靠群众、自力更生地解决水利器材，是多快好省地建设水利的重要途径。
    大闹技术革新，大闹工具改革，使一般的工地达到先进工地的水平，必须进一步加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，反透右倾，鼓足干劲，大搞群众运动。任何地方只要这样做了，就一定能够把工效大大提高，把水利建设高工效运动推向新的更大的高潮。
