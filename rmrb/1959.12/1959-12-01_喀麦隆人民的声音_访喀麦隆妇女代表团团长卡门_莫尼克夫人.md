The Voice of the Cameroonian People
——An Interview with Madame Carmen Monique, Head of the Cameroonian Women's Delegation
By Our Reporter Wang Boqing

This March, under the manipulation of the United Nations by the United States, Britain, and France, French Cameroon was hypocritically promised "independence" in January 1960. This date is fast approaching. What is the Cameroonian people's response to it?

On November 28th, this reporter interviewed Madame Carmen Monique, head of the Cameroonian Women's Delegation, in Beijing and asked her to introduce the situation of the Cameroonian people's struggle. When the topic of the January 1960 "independence" was mentioned, Madame Carmen Monique suddenly showed a stern expression on her face. She waved her arms and said with unwavering certainty: "Yes, the Cameroonian people need independence, they need genuine independence rights, but we do not want empty independence. The 'independence' of January 1960 is a deceptive trick. The colonialists are attempting to use it to blind our eyes and make the Cameroonian people abandon their struggle."

"We have long recognized the jackal faces of the colonialists, and we will never be deceived!" Madame Carmen Monique repeatedly mentioned these words in the conversation, making one strongly feel her and the Cameroonian people's firm will and courageous spirit in fighting against colonialism. She is only twenty-nine years old this year. What force has made her so strong in these short years? After pondering for a moment, Madame Carmen Monique showed an expression as if enduring pain and recounted her personal experiences to the reporter.

1955 is as fresh as yesterday for the Cameroonian people. At that time, the national movement entered a new climax. Patriots gathered and took to the streets to demonstrate. Various democratic parties and organizations issued joint statements demanding an end to the "trusteeship" system and the establishment of a sovereign Cameroonian state. The French colonialists, enraged, resorted to the most brutal means to suppress the people's struggle for independence. They used machine guns to shoot at the demonstrating masses and declared the People's Union, the Democratic Women's Union, and the Democratic Youth Union illegal. The blood of patriots stained the land red, and white terror enveloped the entire Cameroon….

It was at this critical moment, after a rally, that Madame Carmen Monique, then Vice-President of the Cameroonian Democratic Women's Union, was arrested in Mongo. During her two years in prison, she tasted the bitterness of the world because she was unwilling to do anything that violated the will of the Cameroonian people. As soon as she entered the prison, the French constables beat her black and blue with clubs, and they also lit matches to burn her legs. If she moved even slightly, she would be beaten again. In the first three days of being locked in the cell, the colonialists ignored her groans and gasps and did not give her a drop of water or a bite to eat. In the following months, apart from being dragged out for torture, she was not allowed to breathe fresh air, see the sunlight, or even go out to defecate or urinate. Even in those difficult days, she and her fellow prisoners launched a struggle against the colonialists by means of a hunger strike.

The colonialists then came up with new tricks, vainly attempting to soften her and make her yield. They knew she was a Catholic, so they sent a "priest" to persuade her to break away from the Cameroonian People's Union and abandon the struggle for national independence. They said that this would restore her "freedom." Madame Carmen Monique firmly replied: "I would rather stay in prison; I will never be a traitor!"

The "priest" had to leave in disgrace in the face of justice. But what followed was a cruel and inhumane torture. One day, the French constables stripped her naked, first plucking the hair from her body strand by strand. The inhuman colonialists then pulled her arms apart, pulled her up, and took pictures of her enduring suffering and humiliation.

Madame Carmen Monique said with tears in her eyes that her husband was the head of the Mongo branch of the Cameroonian People's Union and had contributed his life to the Cameroonian national liberation cause in the white terror of 1955. She was already four months pregnant when she was imprisoned, and the child was aborted due to the torture of the colonialists. Sixteen male and female patriots were imprisoned with her, and only three of them came out alive in 1957 with the help of the people. At that time, in other parts of Cameroon, many patriots were subjected to electric shock in prisons. The colonialists even tied the hands and feet of the patriots, blindfolded them, put them on airplanes, and then threw them down over the sea and the wilderness…

Madame Carmen Monique said angrily at this time: "Now, the colonialists continue to carry out bloody massacres in Cameroon, not allowing the Cameroonian people to conduct democratic elections before independence, not allowing patriotic organizations to be legalized, and refusing to release 'political prisoners,' but they say they want to give Cameroon 'independence'!?" What kind of trick is this "independence"? Madame Carmen Monique described it during her visit to Beijing. She compared it to how people coax children to be good by giving them a cloth doll or stuffing a piece of candy in their mouths to make them happy. The "independence" that the colonialists promised to Cameroon is just a deceptive cloth doll or candy. She said: "The awakened Cameroonian people are not naive and ignorant children. We have bled and suffered, and we clearly know that the colonialists will not give us true independence. True independence must be won through the struggle of the people."

When talking about the current situation in Cameroon, Madame Carmen Monique was filled with joy of victory, and her voice was so clear and seemed particularly excited and proud. She and the other two members of the delegation introduced that under the leadership of the Cameroonian People's Union, the Cameroonian People's Liberation Army is carrying out a resolute struggle in twenty-one districts. They not only attacked the enemy's village barracks but also stormed into large cities, not only destroying the enemy's cars and airplanes but also skillfully killing the enemy's officers, making them unable to live in peace day and night. In this struggle, the men, women, old, and young in Cameroon all bravely and ingeniously helped their army. "While fighting against French and British colonialists, the Cameroonian people also firmly oppose American imperialism's supply of weapons to France. American weapons are massacring the Cameroonian people, and the American invaders also cunningly say that their weapons are for the safety of French colonialists. The sinister face of American imperialism cannot deceive the eyes of the Cameroonian people. We will never allow American imperialism to intervene and enslave us. We will also never allow the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to establish military bases in Cameroon to use it to suppress the Cameroonian and African people's struggle for freedom and independence." These words expressed the will of all patriotic Cameroonian people.

The interview ended. At the time of farewell, Madame Carmen Monique stood up enthusiastically and once again said to the reporter: "Please tell the Chinese people that Cameroon has not yet gained true independence. We must continue to fight until we achieve final victory." On the land of Africa and Cameroon, where the flames of anti-colonialism are burning, the sound of struggle is getting louder and louder. As long as we are vigilant and persist in the struggle, the banner of true independence will one day fly high in the sky of Cameroon.

    喀麦隆人民的声音
    ——访喀麦隆妇女代表团团长卡门·莫尼克夫人
    本报记者  汪波清
    今年3月，联合国在美英法操纵下，假惺惺地允诺法属喀麦隆在1960年1月“独立”。这个日子很快就要到来，喀麦隆人民对它的答复是什么呢？
    11月28日，记者在北京访问了喀麦隆妇女代表团团长卡门·莫尼克夫人，请她介绍了喀麦隆人民斗争的情况。当谈到1960年1月“独立”这个问题的时候，卡门·莫尼克夫人忽然脸上显出严峻的表情，她挥动手臂，斩钉截铁般地说道：“是的，喀麦隆人民需要独立，需要真正的独立权利，但是我们不要空头的独立。1960年1月的‘独立’是骗人的把戏，殖民主义者居心要用它蒙蔽我们的眼睛，使喀麦隆人民放弃斗争。”
    “我们早已认清了殖民主义者的豺狼面目，我们决不会受骗！”卡门·莫尼克夫人在谈话中一再讲到这些话语，使人强烈地感到她和喀麦隆人民反殖民主义的坚定意志和斗争勇气。她今年才二十九岁，是什么力量使她在这短短的岁月里变得这样坚强呢？卡门·莫尼克夫人沉思片刻以后，显出像忍耐创痛的神情，向记者追述了她的亲身遭遇。
    1955年，对于喀麦隆人民说来就像昨天一样。那时民族运动进入了新的高潮，爱国者纷纷集会，并且走上街头游行示威，各民主政党和团体发表联合声明，要求结束“托管”制度，建立喀麦隆主权国家。法国殖民主义者恼羞成怒，竟然采取最残酷的手段来镇压人民争取独立的斗争。他们用机关枪扫射游行示威的群众，宣布人民联盟、民主妇女联盟、民主青年联盟为非法，许多爱国组织的领袖和成员被逮捕，爱国者的鲜血染红了大地，白色恐怖笼罩了整个喀麦隆……。
    就在这个严重的关头，在一次集会以后，当时担任喀麦隆民主妇女联盟副主席的卡门·莫尼克夫人，在蒙戈地方被捕了。在监狱的两年时光里，由于她不愿做出违背喀麦隆人民意志的事情，她尝尽了人间的苦楚。一入狱，法国宪兵就用棍棒把她打得皮青肉肿，还划着一根根火柴烧烤两腿，如果稍有动弹，就又是一阵毒打。在关进牢房的最初三天里，殖民主义者不顾她呻吟、喘息，不给一口水喝、一口饭吃。在以后的几个月里，她除被拖出去受折磨外，根本不让她呼吸新鲜空气，不准见到阳光，甚至不准外出大便、小便。就是在这样艰难的日子里，她也和难友们一起用绝食手段同殖民主义者展开斗争。
    殖民主义者接着又想出了新花样，妄图用软化使她屈服。他们知道她是天主教徒，便派来“神甫”劝诱，要她脱离喀麦隆人民联盟，放弃争取民族独立斗争。他们说，这样她就会恢复“自由”。卡门·莫尼克夫人坚定地回答说：“我情愿留在监狱，我决不做叛徒！”
    “神甫”在正义面前，只得灰溜溜地走了。但接着降临的是惨绝人寰的酷刑。一天，法国宪兵把她的衣服脱得净光，先是一绺一绺地拔掉她身上的毛发。灭绝人性的殖民者又分开拉住手臂，把她扯了起来，拍摄了她忍苦受辱的照片。
    卡门·莫尼克夫人含着泪水说，她的丈夫是喀麦隆人民联盟蒙戈地方支部的负责人，就在1955年白色恐怖中为喀麦隆民族解放事业贡献出自己的生命。她入狱时怀孕已经四个月，由于殖民主义者的折磨，孩子流产了。和她一起入狱的还有十六个男女爱国者，1957年在人民的援救之下，活着出来的只有三个人。当时在喀麦隆的其它地方，许多爱国者在监狱里遭受电刑，殖民主义者甚至还把爱国者的手腿绑住，蒙起眼睛，装上飞机，然后在大海和荒林的上空，把他们抛了下来……。
    卡门·莫尼克夫人这时气愤地说道：“现在，殖民主义者继续在喀麦隆进行血腥的屠杀，不让喀麦隆人民在独立前进行民主选举，不准爱国的组织合法化，不肯释放‘政治犯’，可是他们却说要给喀麦隆‘独立’！？”这“独立”是怎样一种戏法呢？卡门·莫尼克夫人在北京访问期间曾描绘过它。她比喻说，人们哄孩子学乖，总是递给他一个布娃娃，或者向他嘴里塞一块糖，就算了事。殖民主义者答应给喀麦隆的“独立”，只是哄骗人的布娃娃或糖果。她说：“觉醒了的喀麦隆人民并不是幼稚无知的儿童。我们流过血、受过苦，我们清楚地知道殖民主义者不会给我们真正的独立，真正的独立必须依靠人民的斗争去争取。”
    谈到目前喀麦隆形势的时候，卡门·莫尼克夫人满怀胜利的喜悦，谈话的声音是那样爽朗，显得格外兴奋而又自豪。她和代表团的另外两位团员介绍说，在喀麦隆人民联盟领导下，喀麦隆人民解放军在二十一个区内进行坚决的斗争。他们不仅袭击敌人的乡村兵营，而且还打进大城市，不仅毁坏敌人的汽车、飞机，也巧妙地杀死敌人的军官，使他们日夜不得安生。在这一场斗争中，喀麦隆男女老少都英勇机智地帮助自己的军队。“在同法英殖民主义者斗争的同时，喀麦隆人民还坚决反对美帝国主义向法国供应武器。美国武器屠杀着喀麦隆人民，美国侵略者还狡猾地说他们的武器是为了法国殖民者的安全。美帝国主义的阴险面目瞒不过喀麦隆人民的眼睛，我们绝不允许美帝国主义来插手奴役我们。我们也绝不允许北大西洋公约组织在喀麦隆建立军事基地，用它来镇压喀麦隆和非洲人民争取自由独立的斗争。”她们的这些话表达了全体爱国的喀麦隆人民的意志。
    访问结束了。在告别的时候，卡门·莫尼克夫人热情地站起来，再一次对记者说：“请告诉中国人民，喀麦隆还没有获得真正的独立，我们要继续斗争下去，直到获得最后胜利。”在延烧着反殖民主义火焰的非洲和喀麦隆的土地上，斗争的声浪愈来愈高。只要提高警惕，坚持斗争，真正的独立旗帜，总有一天会在喀麦隆的上空高高飘扬。
