Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 3rd. A Japanese girl from Nagasaki, Nagata, who was injured in the atomic bomb explosion fourteen years ago, has now been cured by Soviet doctors and has become a student at the Moscow Textile Institute (see picture above).

She was only ten years old when the atomic bomb fell on Nagasaki, and her grandmother, mother, and older sister were all killed. The seriously injured Nagata encountered "no way to treat" answers everywhere in Japan. Last summer, she arrived in Moscow and received medical treatment at the National Research Institute of Otorhinolaryngology. Over the past year, five extremely complex plastic surgeries have been performed. Nagata's throat was severely injured, but it was finally cured by Soviet doctors, allowing her to breathe naturally again.

The "Soviet Russia Newspaper" published a report about Nagata on the 1st, quoting her as saying: "I am moved by the kind care that the Soviet people have shown to me, a Japanese girl. I will never forget this. My heart is filled with deep gratitude to the Soviet doctors." (Attached picture)

    苏联医生治愈一日本原子弹受害者
    长崎姑娘长田脱离苦海在莫斯科学习
    新华社莫斯科3日电　日本长崎姑娘长田在十四年前受到原子弹爆炸的伤害，现在经过苏联医师治愈，已经成为莫斯科纺织学院的学生（见上图）。
    原子弹落在长崎时她才十岁，她的祖母、母亲和姊姊都牺牲了。受了重伤的长田在日本到处碰到：“没法治疗”的回答。去年夏天她到了莫斯科，在国家耳鼻喉科学研究所就医。一年来，进行了五次极为复杂的成形手术。长田的喉头受伤很重，也终于被苏联医生治好了，使她恢复了自然呼吸。
    1日的“苏维埃俄罗斯报”刊登了一篇关于长田的报道，引用了她的话：“我被苏联人对我这日本姑娘的亲切关怀所感动。我永远忘不了这些。我的心充满了对苏联医生的深深感谢。”（附图片）
