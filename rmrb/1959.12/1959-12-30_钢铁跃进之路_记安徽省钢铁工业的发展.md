　　The Steel Leap Forward Road
　　——A Record of the Development of the Steel Industry in Anhui Province
　　By our correspondent　Tang Tianzhen
    Anhui, this young steel industrial base, is full of youthful vitality and is developing at high speed. In 1957, the province's pig iron production was only 200,900 tons, and steel was non-existent. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the province's pig iron production soared to 1,073,000 tons, and steel production reached 130,000 tons. This year, Anhui's steel front has made another huge leap.
    With such a weak foundation and such a short period of time, how were such great achievements made? A visit to Anhui will deeply impress you: this is nothing else but the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the victory of the Party's policy of "walking on two legs."
    Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods, From Indigenous to Foreign
    When the great steel industry campaign began last year, Anhui launched a large-scale indigenous iron smelting campaign in vast areas of the province. These small indigenous furnaces were all built with bricks and mud, using wooden bellows for blowing air, and all work was done manually. At that time, small blast furnaces were being built at an accelerated pace. Before long, "small foreign groups" developed from "small indigenous groups." Many small blast furnaces were built and put into production, gradually replacing small indigenous furnaces and taking on the heavy responsibility of iron smelting. At this time, electric blowers replaced bellows, hoists replaced people and baskets, hot air replaced cold air.... In Hefei, Huainan, Bengbu and other places on the Huainan railway line from south to north, and in Ma'anshan, Wuhu, Tongling, and Fanchang and other cities along the Yangtze River from east to west, groups of small blast furnaces were built, forming a strong "T" shaped steel base network.
    At the time, people's attitudes towards this approach were not entirely consistent. Some advocated using foreign methods and not indigenous methods, using large methods and not small methods; some advocated using indigenous methods and not foreign methods, using small methods and not large methods. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China seriously analyzed the actual situation, resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee's policy of simultaneously developing foreign and indigenous methods of production, and, based on Anhui's specific conditions, determined the approach of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with foreign methods as the mainstay." On the one hand, small indigenous furnaces were established in the vast countryside; on the other hand, in towns with conditions such as power, transportation, and technical strength, "small foreign groups" were vigorously developed from indigenous to foreign methods. The starting point of this approach was: neither to blindly believe in foreign production methods and negate indigenous production methods, nor to be satisfied with indigenous production methods and negate foreign production methods; but to base it on local conditions, use foreign methods if possible, and if not, first engage in indigenous methods, and then actively create conditions to gradually transform "small indigenous groups" into "small foreign groups" and further improve "small foreign groups."
    It was precisely this "walking on two legs" approach that fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses, inspired the masses' spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and launched a vigorous mass movement for the entire people to engage in the great steel campaign in Anhui Province. In just four months last year, more than eight hundred and eighty small blast furnaces with a volume of eight to twenty-eight cubic meters were built from indigenous to foreign methods in various places; this year, in less than six months, forty-two three-ton small converters were built. These small blast furnaces and small converters vigorously promoted industrial and agricultural production and laid the foundation for greater development of the steel industry in the future.
    Consolidate and Improve, Comprehensive Leap Forward
    At the beginning of this year, Anhui Province's steel "small foreign groups" entered a new stage of consolidation and improvement. Over the past year, many major innovations and renovations have emerged in terms of blast furnace equipment, operating technology, and mining and coking production.
    Take the equipment renovation of small blast furnaces in Hefei City as an example. After the successful trial of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee’s Steel Plant to replace the hot blast stove with large pipes in July this year, steel plants in Hefei City quickly promoted this experience and developed it into five technical modifications to the entire air supply system during the promotion process. These are: changing the small pipes of the hot blast stove to large pipes, changing the thin cold and hot air pipes and surrounding pipes to thick ones, changing the spectacle valve to a regulating valve, and changing the small tuyere to a large tuyere or multiple tuyeres. This made various pipelines more reasonable, reduced wind resistance and loss, and expanded the amount of air entering the furnace. After the implementation of the five technical modifications, the amount of air entering the furnace in small blast furnaces in the city generally increased by about 30%, the wind temperature increased from 400 degrees to 500 to 600 degrees, the smelting intensity increased from 1 to 1.5 or more, and the life of the hot blast stove was extended from less than a month to six months, creating conditions for high-quality, high-yield, and low-consumption small blast furnaces.
    After the technical transformation of small blast furnaces throughout Anhui Province, various technical and economic indicators have achieved a comprehensive leap forward. In November, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the province increased from 0.636 in January to 1.411; the coke ratio decreased from 1.976 in January to 1.11; the pass rate of pig iron increased from 55.7% in March to 91.99%; and the production cost per ton of iron also decreased from 467 yuan in the first quarter to 262.62 yuan.
    The technical transformation of mines and coking plants is also constantly being carried out. Since the great steel campaign last year, Anhui Province has opened up more than 70 mining points. At the beginning, most of these medium and small mines were mined using indigenous methods. After continuous transformation and improvement this year, the production appearance of many mines has been greatly changed. Many mines of the Fanchang County Mining Bureau have basically realized the ropeway of high-slope trolleys, the trainization of flat ground tracks, the hoisting of loading hoppers, and the simplified mechanization of rock drilling. Due to the continuous improvement of the degree of mechanization, the output of the mines has greatly increased. This year, the mining volume of these medium and small mines increased by more than 43% compared with last year. After continuous consolidation and improvement this year, the output of indigenous coking production also increased by four and a half times compared with last year. The rapid development of ore and coke production has effectively ensured the normal operation of small blast furnace production.
    This year, Anhui also adjusted and arranged many steel plants and mines in accordance with the "five determinations" proposed by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, namely, determining location, type, staffing, tasks, and supply relationships, as well as the policy of "strengthening large factories, merging small factories, shrinking zero points, and concentrating on key points." The province further carried out overall planning based on the distribution of small blast furnaces. Most regions established steel general plants, merging the original 133 steel production units into 58 units. Mines, coking plants, and refractory material plants were placed under the leadership of steel plants, or established fixed supply relationships with steel plants, which greatly improved raw material supply work. After such adjustments, Anhui Province has emerged as larger-scale steel joint enterprises, which facilitated production scheduling and management, promoted large-scale collaboration between factories and mines, and reduced product costs.

　　Look to Large Blast Furnaces
    "Look to large foreign blast furnaces" has become the slogan of action for all employees of small blast furnaces in Anhui Province. In fact, for some advanced small blast furnaces, this is already a living reality. They have not only caught up, but some have even surpassed them.
    Next to the rows of medium-sized blast furnaces in Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, there is a small blast furnace that is not very noticeable, which is the nationally famous "Red Flag No. 2" furnace. Its various production indicators have caught up with large blast furnaces. From January to November this year, its average utilization coefficient reached 2.46, the coke ratio was reduced to 0.851, the pass rate of iron reached 98.5%, and the cost per ton of iron was 140.51 yuan. In December, the production of this small blast furnace reached a new peak. From December 1st to 20th, the average utilization coefficient increased to 4.242, the coke ratio was reduced to 0.805, and the pig iron pass rate reached 100%.
    More than just one "Red Flag No. 2" furnace can be compared with large blast furnaces! Under the slogan of "Learn from Red Flag No. 2, catch up with Red Flag No. 2," the utilization coefficient of the No. 12 small blast furnace of the Anhui Provincial Finance and Trade Steel Plant has increased to 4.216 since December, the coke ratio has been reduced to 0.762, and the pig iron pass rate has reached 100%. What is particularly exciting is that in the past, small blast furnaces in areas with relatively poor production have also leaped up in batches. In Hefei City, the average utilization coefficient of more than 90 small blast furnaces was only 0.663 in July, the coke ratio was 1.74, and the pig iron pass rate was 86.5%; since December, the average utilization coefficient of all small blast furnaces in the city has increased to 1.875, the coke ratio has decreased to 0.946, and the iron pass rate has reached 96.94%.
    In the past, some people believed that: "Small blast furnaces have poor equipment, no precise instruments, and small heat storage capacity, so it is impossible to smelt high-quality steelmaking pig iron." The facts have negated this argument.
    Smelting this high-quality pig iron is indeed not without difficulties for the current small blast furnaces. However, the workers of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's Steel Plant tried every means to overcome equipment and technical difficulties, broke through technical barriers such as sulfur, silicon, phosphorus, manganese, and carbon, and finally smelted high-quality steelmaking pig iron.

    The Power of Small Foreign Groups
    "Small foreign groups" – this product of the Great Leap Forward has grown and become stronger, and is increasingly showing its great power.
    The iron produced by small blast furnaces in Anhui Province is of good quality, whether it is used for steelmaking or manufacturing mechanical equipment. Since this year, from morning to night, large quantities of pig iron have been shipped out by train and ship every day. Some of this iron is transferred to Shanghai for steelmaking, and some is transferred to various places for manufacturing mechanical equipment. This year, Anhui, a young steel industrial base, has not only achieved self-sufficiency in pig iron, but has also "turned to export," becoming one of the main raw material supply bases for the Shanghai steelmaking industry.
    Today, in Anhui Province, you can see various mechanical equipment manufactured with iron from small blast furnaces everywhere. These equipments not only meet the needs of the province, but also support units such as Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Steel. This year, Anhui Province also used iron from small blast furnaces to lay 25 indigenous railways, 11 of which have been opened to traffic. In the fields of the vast countryside, the various new-style small agricultural tools manufactured with iron from small blast furnaces are even more countless, and the quality is "excellent."
    "Go red to the end of the year and have a good start next year," the steel workers of Anhui Province are fighting to achieve this goal. New battle reports, new creations, new achievements... are emerging like mushrooms after a rain.
    I wish all small blast furnaces will sing triumphant songs in the new year and fly side by side with large blast furnaces!

　　钢铁跃进之路
　　——记安徽省钢铁工业的发展
　　本报记者　汤天真
    安徽，这个年轻的钢铁工业基地，充满青春活力，高速度向前发展着。1957年，全省生铁产量只有二十万零九千吨，钢还是空白。在大跃进的1958年，全省生铁产量便猛增到一百零七万三千吨，钢的产量达到十三万吨；今年，安徽省钢铁战线又有了巨大的跃进。
    原来的基础那样薄弱，时间是如此短促，这样大的成就是怎样取得的呢？只要到安徽来看一看，你就会深切地感到：这不是别的，这正是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，这正是党的“两条腿走路”方针的胜利。
    土洋并举　由土到洋
    去年大办钢铁工业一开始，安徽就在全省广大地区大搞土法炼铁。这些小土炉，全是用砖和泥砌成的，吹风用的是木制风箱，一切工作都是用人力进行的。那时候，小高炉正在加紧建设。过了不久，“小洋群”在“小土群”的基础上发展起来了。许多小高炉建成投入生产，逐步代替了小土炉，担负起了炼铁的重任。这时候，电动鼓风机代替了风箱，卷扬机代替了人和筐子，热风代替了冷风……。在自南而北的淮南铁路线上的合肥、淮南、蚌埠等地，和自东而西的长江沿线的马鞍山、芜湖、铜陵和繁昌等城市，都建起了小高炉群，形成了一个“丁”字形的强大的钢铁基地网。
    当时，人们对这种做法的态度并不是完全一致的。有的主张搞洋的不搞土的，搞大的不搞小的；有的主张搞土的不搞洋的，搞小的不搞大的。中共安徽省委认真分析了实际情况，坚决贯彻执行了党中央提出的洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针，并且根据安徽的具体条件，确定了“土洋结合，以洋为主”的作法。一方面在广大农村建立小土炉；另一方面，在动力、交通、技术力量等条件具备的城镇，由土到洋地大搞“小洋群”。这种作法的出发点是：既不迷信洋法生产，否定土法生产，也不满足于土法生产，否定洋法生产；而是根据当地条件，能洋则洋，不能洋则先搞土的，然后，再积极创造条件，逐步把“小土群”转化为“小洋群”，把“小洋群”进一步提高。
    正是这种“两条腿走路”的作法，充分发挥了广大群众的积极性，鼓舞了群众敢想敢做的精神，使安徽全省掀起了轰轰烈烈的全民大办钢铁的群众运动。在去年短短的四个月内，各地就由土到洋建成了八百八十多座容积八至二十八立方米的小高炉；今年又在不到六个月的时间内，建成了四十二座三吨的小转炉。这些小高炉和小转炉，有力地促进了工农业生产，并为今后钢铁工业更大的发展打下了基础。
    巩固提高　全面跃进
    今年一开始，安徽省的钢铁“小洋群”就进入了巩固提高的新阶段。一年来，无论在高炉设备、操作技术，还是采矿、炼焦生产等方面，都涌现出了许多重大的创造和革新。
    就以合肥市小高炉的设备改造来说吧。今年7月间，中共安徽省委机关钢铁厂热风炉改用大管道试验成功以后，合肥市各钢铁厂迅速推广了这一经验，并在推广中发展成对整个送风系统的五项技术改造。这就是：热风炉小管道改成大管道，冷、热风管道及围管由细改粗，眼镜伐改成调节伐，以及小风口改成大风口或多风口。这样，就使各种管道更加合理，减少了风的阻力和损失，扩大了入炉风量。实行五项技术改造以后，全市小高炉的入炉风量一般都增加30％左右，风温由四百度提高到五百度至六百度，冶炼强度由一提高到一点五以上，热风炉的寿命由原来不到一个月延长到六个月，为小高炉优质、高产、低耗创造了条件。
    安徽全省小高炉经过了技术改造以后，各项技术经济指标获得了全面的跃进。11月份，全省小高炉的平均利用系数，就由1月份的零点六三六提高到一点四一一；焦比由1月份的一点九七六，下降到一点一一；生铁的合格率，由3月份的55.7％提高到91.99％；每吨铁的生产成本，也由第一季度的四百六十七元下降到二百六十二点六二元。
    矿山和焦厂的技术改造也在不停地进行。去年大办钢铁以来，安徽省开辟了七十多处矿点。这批中、小型矿山，在开始时绝大部分都是用土法开采的，经过今年不断地改造和提高，许多矿山的生产面貌已经大大改观。繁昌县矿务局不少矿场，已经基本上实现了高坡滑车绳索化，平地轨道火车化，装车漏斗起重化，凿岩简易机械化。由于机械化程度的不断提高，矿山的产量大大增加。今年这些中、小型矿山的采矿量，比去年增长了43％以上。土法炼焦生产经过今年不断地巩固提高，产量也比去年增长了四倍半。矿石和焦炭生产的飞跃发展，有力地保证了小高炉生产的正常进行。
    今年，安徽各地还根据中共安徽省委提出的“五定”，即定点、定型、定员、定任务和定供应关系，以及“加强大厂，归并小厂，收缩零点，集中重点”的方针，对许多钢铁厂和矿山进行了调整和安排。全省根据小高炉分布的情况，进一步进行了全面规划，多数地区都成立了钢铁总厂，将原有的一百三十三个钢铁生产单位合并为五十八个单位。矿山、焦厂、耐火材料厂划归钢铁厂领导，或者同钢铁厂建立了固定的供应关系，这就大大改善了原料供应工作。经过这样的调整以后，安徽省出现了规模较大的钢铁联合企业，便利了生产的调度和管理，促进了厂矿之间的大协作，降低了产品的成本。
　　向大高炉看齐
    “向大洋高炉看齐”，已经成为安徽省小高炉全体职工的行动口号。其实，对于一些先进的小高炉来说，这已是活生生的现实，他们不但赶上了，有的还超过了。
    在马鞍山钢铁公司一排排的中型高炉旁，有一座不大引人注意的小高炉，它就是全国闻名的“红旗二号”炉。它的各项生产指标都赶上了大高炉。今年1至11月份，它的平均利用系数达到了二点四六，焦比降低到零点八五一，铁的合格率达到了98.5％，每吨铁的成本是一百四十点五一元。12月份，这座小高炉的生产又登上了新的高峰。12月1日到20日，平均利用系数提高到四点二四二，焦比降低到零点八零五，生铁合格率达到了100％。
    能够同大高炉媲美的，岂止一个“红旗二号”炉！在“学红旗二号，赶红旗二号”的口号下，安徽省财贸钢厂的十二号小高炉，12月份以来的利用系数提高到四点二一六，焦比降低到零点七六二，生铁合格率达到100％。特别令人兴奋的是，原来生产比较差的地区，小高炉也成批成批地跃上来了。合肥市九十多座小高炉，7月份平均利用系数还只有零点六六三，焦比是一点七四，生铁合格率是86.5％；12月以来，这个市所有小高炉的平均利用系数已经提高到一点八七五，焦比下降到零点九四六，铁的合格率达到96.94％。
    过去，有些人认为：“小高炉设备差，没有精确的仪表，储热量小，不可能炼出优质炼钢生铁。”事实已经否定了这一论断。
    冶炼这种质量高的生铁，对目前的小高炉来说，的确不是没有困难。但是，中共安徽省委机关钢铁厂的工人，千方百计克服了设备和技术上的困难，突破了硫、矽、磷、锰、碳等技术关，终于把优质炼钢生铁炼成了。
    小洋群的威力
    “小洋群”——这个大跃进的产物，已经成长壮大起来，越来越显示出它的巨大威力。
    安徽省小高炉生产的铁，不论是炼钢，还是制造机械设备，质量都很好。今年以来，从清晨到夜晚，每天都有大批的生铁通过火车、轮船源源外运。这些铁有的是调到上海炼钢的，有的是调往各地制造机械设备的。安徽这个年轻的钢铁工业基地，今年不仅做到生铁自给，而且“转入为出”，成为上海炼钢工业的主要原料供应地之一了。
    如今，在安徽省，你随处都可以看到用小高炉的铁制造的各种机械设备。这些设备，不仅供应本省的需要，有的还支援武钢、包钢等单位。今年，安徽省还用小高炉的铁铺设了二十五条土铁路，有十一条已经通车了。在广大农村的田野里，用小高炉的铁制造的各种新式小型农具，更是难以数计，而质量都是“呱呱叫”的。
    “今年红到底，明年开门红”，安徽省的钢铁工人们正为实现这一目标而战斗着。新的战表、新的创造、新的成就……有如雨后春笋。
    祝所有的小高炉，在新的一年中，齐奏凯歌，同大高炉比翼齐飞！
