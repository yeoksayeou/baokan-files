This newspaper's Harbin dispatch on the 6th: The Harbin Electric Wire Factory boldly reformed its factory power distribution system, promoting the experience of "simplification, step-up, ring network power supply," achieving more supply with less loss, rationality, and safety. This not only improved the power supply capacity and saved a large amount of electricity but also saved a large amount of electrical equipment, playing an important role in ensuring the continued Great Leap Forward in production.

The Harbin Electric Wire Factory is a modernized factory expanded from an old factory. The entire factory's power distribution system was based on workshops as units, each with dedicated lines and dedicated transformers. With the expansion of the factory, the number of electrical equipment in the factory became more and more numerous and complex. In terms of voltage levels alone, the factory had five types: 6,600 volts, 3,300 volts, 380 volts, 220 volts, and 110 volts. There were as many as eighteen transmission lines; there were eighty-seven transformers; and power, lighting, and streetlights each had their own transformer equipment. Because the voltages were not uniform, the substations could not communicate with each other. There were as many as four substations; if this workshop or substation had a fault, that workshop or substation could not provide support, and production had to be stopped. The factory's electricity use was not rational, economical, safe, or convenient to maintain.

In order to change the above situation, the Harbin Electric Wire Factory Party Committee decided to promote the experience of "simplification, step-up, ring network power supply" to thoroughly reform the factory's power distribution system. The experience of "simplification, step-up, ring network power supply" was first successfully implemented at the Harbin Red Flag Chemical Factory. Simplification means reducing or merging equipment in the factory's power distribution system as much as possible to reduce power loss and save materials; step-up means increasing the voltage and reducing the voltage levels while fully utilizing the original equipment to improve the power supply capacity and reduce power loss on the lines; ring network power supply means connecting the power supply lines in a ring, connecting each workshop and substation together. When the Harbin Electric Wire Factory Party Committee proposed to promote the experience of simplifying, stepping up, and ring network power supply, some people thought that the project was too large and troublesome to modify, and there was no time to do it; others thought that the experience was not mature and were afraid that modifications would cause accidents, advocating that the old method should still be followed.

In order to unify understanding, the Party Committee first mobilized the masses to criticize various conservative ideas; then, it organized technicians and workers to seriously study the experience of the Red Flag Chemical Factory and, combined with the actual situation of the factory, proposed the steps for this reform. The first step was to directly convert the 6,600-volt high-voltage power source introduced into the factory into 380 volts; the second step was to uniformly increase the original 220-volt and 110-volt voltages to 380 volts. This change greatly simplified the original power levels and distribution equipment. The original eighteen lines in the factory were changed to eight, eighty-seven transformers were reduced by seventy-five, and four substations were reduced by one. With the same voltage, the lines could be interconnected, creating conditions for implementing a ring network power supply. After the reform of the power supply system in Harbin, the power supply capacity and voltage quality were greatly improved, the machine speed was accelerated, and the daily output rapidly increased by 15%. According to calculations, the entire factory can save 730,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. This electricity can be used to produce 1,460 tons of steel, weave 7.3 million meters of cloth, and grind 730,000 bags of flour. After simplifying the equipment, the dismantled electrical materials included more than 14,000 meters of various metal wires, more than 400 various switches, eight electric poles, eleven distribution panels, and many transformers and voltage transformers, with a total value of 200,100 yuan. This batch of equipment can be used to install five chemical fertilizer plants with an annual output of 1,000 tons or eight agricultural machinery factories with an annual output of 5,000 weeding machines. The reform not only guaranteed the factory's Great Leap Forward but also used the dismantled equipment and saved electricity to support other industrial and agricultural Great Leap Forwards.

After the Harbin Electric Wire Factory implemented the "simplification, step-up, ring network power supply," the 267 electrical safety defects left over from history were basically resolved, and electrical accidents were greatly reduced.

The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attach great importance to this experience. They are vigorously promoting this experience in an organized and planned manner.

    哈尔滨电线厂配电系统大改革
    减少变压器七十五台、金属线一万四千米，每年节约七十三万度电，机器转速加快，日产量提高15％
    本报哈尔滨6日电　哈尔滨电线厂大胆改革厂用配电系统，推行
  “简化、升压、环形供电”经验，做到了多供少损、合理安全，既提高了供电能力，节约了大量电力，又节省了大量电气设备，对保证生产继续跃进起了重要作用。
    哈尔滨电线厂是一个由老厂扩建的现代化工厂。全厂配电系统是以车间为单位，分别设专用线和专用变压器；随着工厂的扩建，厂内电气设备也越来越多，越来越复杂。光电压等级，全厂就有六千六百伏、三千三百伏、三百八十伏、二百二十伏、一百一十伏五种；输电线路多到十八趟；变压器就有八十七台；动力、照明、路灯各有各的变压设备。变电所又因为电压不统一，不能互相联络，多至四座；这个车间或变电所出了故障，那个车间或变电所不能支援，只好被迫停止生产。厂内用电既不合理，也不经济，不安全，维护也不方便。
    为了改变上述情况，哈尔滨电线厂党委决定推广“简化升压环形供电”经验，彻底改革厂用配电系统。“简化升压环形供电”的经验，首先是在哈尔滨红旗化工厂试行成功的。所谓简化，就是把厂内配电系统中可以减去或合并的设备，尽量减去或合并，以减少电力损耗，节省器材；所谓升压，就是在充分利用原有设备的条件下，提高电压，减少电压等级。提高供电能力，减少线路上的电力损失；所谓环形供电，就是把供电线路接成环形，使各车间、变电所连成一气。当哈尔滨电线厂党委提出推广简化升压环形供电经验时，有人认为工程太大，改起来麻烦，没时间搞；也有的认为经验不成熟，怕改了出事故，主张仍旧照老办法行事。
    为了统一认识，党委首先发动群众批判了各种保守思想；接着又组织技术人员和工人认真学习研究了红旗化工厂的经验，并结合本厂实际情况，提出了这项改革的步骤。第一步是把引进厂的六千六百伏高压电源直接变成三百八十伏；第二步把原来的二百二十伏和一百一十伏电压，统一升高为三百八十伏。这样一改，就使原来的电力等级和配电设备大大简化了。全厂原有的十八趟线路，改成了八趟，八十七台变压器，减少了七十五台，四座变电所减少了一座。电压相同了，线路也就可以互相连通，为实行环形供电创造了条件。哈尔滨的供电系统经过改革以后，供电能力和电压质量都大为提高，机器转速加快了，日产量迅速提高了15％。据计算，全厂每年可以节约用电七十三万度，这些电力可以用来增产一千四百六十吨钢，织布七百三十万米，磨面粉七十三万袋。简化设备以后，拆下的电气器材有各种金属导线一万四千多米，各种开关四百多个，电柱八根，配电盘十一面和许多变压器、电压互感器，总值达二十万零一千多元。用这批器材可以装年产千吨的化肥厂五个，年产五千台除草机的农具厂八个。通过改革不仅保证了本厂的跃进，而且用拆下的器材和节省的电力可以支援其它工业和农业跃进。
    哈尔滨电线厂推行“简化升压环形供电”以后，使历史上遗留下来的二百六十七项电气安全缺陷，基本上得到了解决，电气事故大大减少。
    水利电力部和中共黑龙江省委都十分重视这项经验。正在有组织有计划地大力推广这项经验。
