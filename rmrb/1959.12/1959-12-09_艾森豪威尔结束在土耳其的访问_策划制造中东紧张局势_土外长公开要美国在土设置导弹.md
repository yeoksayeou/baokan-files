Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Ankara News: U.S. President Eisenhower and Turkish President Bayar today issued a joint communiqué on Eisenhower's visit to Turkey.

The communiqué emphasized that so-called "free countries" should "maintain unity" in thought and action, and stated that it is "extremely important for the United States and Turkey to cooperate and continue consultations on a bilateral basis, within the framework of NATO and the Central Treaty Organization."

The communiqué revealed that both sides were clearly uneasy about the national independence movements in the Middle East, and they were plotting new conspiracies to create tension. Their statement in the communiqué was "both sides paid particular attention to the issue of subversive activities in the Middle East."

The communiqué also revealed that Turkey requested more "aid" from the United States. The communiqué said that Eisenhower stated that the United States would continue to support Turkey's "efforts in economic development and security." However, the communiqué implied that the United States would further control Turkey through "aid." The communiqué said, "Any aid proves most effective only when the country providing aid and the country receiving aid are united by their commitment to common goals."

The communiqué did not mention the issue of U.S. missile bases in Turkey. However, according to United Press International, Eisenhower, in secret talks with Turkish President Bayar, Prime Minister Menderes, and Foreign Minister Zorlu, assured these Turkish leaders that U.S. negotiations with the Soviet Union did not mean that Washington would "make any concessions" to the Soviet Union. Zorlu also told reporters after the talks that "Turkey will continue to cooperate with the United States in order to set up intermediate-range ballistic missiles here (in Turkey)."

It was revealed that the talks also involved the issue of requesting the United States to participate in the Central Treaty Organization.

Eisenhower arrived in heavily guarded Ankara on the 6th from Rome, Italy. In the residential areas through which Eisenhower passed, a soldier was stationed every twenty-five feet.

Eisenhower left Turkey by plane for Pakistan today.

    艾森豪威尔结束在土耳其的访问
    策划制造中东紧张局势
    土外长公开要美国在土设置导弹
    新华社7日讯　安卡拉消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔和土耳其总统拜亚尔今天就艾森豪威尔访问土耳其发表了联合公报。
    公报强调所谓“自由国家”要在思想上行动上“保持团结”，并且说，美国和土耳其“在双边的基础上、在北大西洋公约组织和中央条约组织范围内进行合作和继续进行磋商是极其重要的”。
    公报透露，双方对中东的民族独立运动显然感到不安，他们策划着制造紧张局势的新的阴谋。他们在公报中的说法是“双方特别注意到中东的颠复活动问题”。
    公报还透露土耳其要求美国给予更多的“援助”。公报说，艾森豪威尔表示美国将继续支持土耳其“在发展经济和安全方面的努力。”但是，公报暗示美国将通过“援助”来进一步控制土耳其，公报中说，“只有当提供援助和接受援助的国家通过致力于共同的目标而团结一致的时候，给予的任何援助才证明是最有效的。”
    公报没有谈到美国在土耳其的导弹基地问题。但是，据合众国际社透露，艾森豪威尔在同土耳其总统拜亚尔、总理曼德列斯和外交部长佐鲁的秘密会谈中，曾经向这些土耳其领导人保证，美国同苏联谈判并不意味着华盛顿会向苏联“作任何让步”。佐鲁在会谈后还向记者说，“土耳其将继续同美国合作，以期在这里（土耳其）设置中程弹道导弹。”
    据透露，这次会谈中还涉及要求美国参加中央条约组织的问题。
    艾森豪威尔是在6日从意大利的罗马到达戒备森严的安卡拉的。在艾森豪威尔通过的居民区，每二十五英尺就有一个士兵站岗。
    艾森豪威尔已经在今天乘飞机离开土耳其前往巴基斯坦。
