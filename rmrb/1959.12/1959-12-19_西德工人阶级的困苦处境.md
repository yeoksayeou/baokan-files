The Plight of the West German Working Class
Shi De

For several years, West Germany's economy experienced relatively rapid development, and some bourgeois propaganda machines have desperately touted West Germany's "economic miracle." However, one of the foundations of West Germany's so-called "economic prosperity" is the brutal exploitation of the working class. In recent years, the plight of the West German working class has become increasingly severe.

The greatest hardship suffered by the West German working class is unemployment and job insecurity. Official reports in late spring of this year stated that job vacancies outnumbered the unemployed for the first time. However, even the West German statistical agencies had to admit that the number of industrial employees in the first half of 1959 was 1% less than in the same period last year. The number of employees in some sectors decreased considerably: the coal mining sector had 35,000 fewer employees in May 1959 than in May 1958. The number of employees decreased in the following sectors: steel industry 8,000, shipbuilding industry 10,000, textile industry 44,000, and clothing industry 7,000. The organ of the West German Trade Union Federation, "Arbeitswelt" (Labor World), pointed out: "Full employment is nothing but an absurd fantasy, while mass layoffs are a real nightmare. Here, these nightmares have become reality."

As a result of laying off workers, shortening working hours, and implementing temporary work, workers worked even 4% fewer hours from January to May 1959 than in the same period last year. This is particularly serious in the coal mining industry. Since the crisis occurred in February last year, six million shifts of work have been suspended, causing miners to lose more than 130 million marks in wages. And since May, the coal mine owners have implemented a new wage agreement, stipulating a five-day work week for 500,000 miners. If the losses in the past only affected a portion of the miners, now it has spread to all miners.

But even those employed workers who currently have relatively fixed wage income, their wages can only barely make ends meet because wages cannot keep up with prices. From February 1958 to February 1959, the average nominal increase in weekly total wages for West German industrial workers was 3%. However, according to official reports, the cost of living index did not increase for "middle-level consumers," while it rose by 2% for so-called low-level consumers. Therefore, even according to official reports, actual wages have hardly changed if the burden of increased taxes is taken into account. And this conclusion is even more accurate due to the rise in prices of some essential commodities in daily life, for example, the price of potatoes has risen by about 40%, the price of beef has increased by 7%, pork has risen by 10%, and coal bricks have risen by 2.4%. Even official West German statistical reports have had to admit that the nominal wages of some West German workers have decreased. From February 1958 to February 1959, the weekly total income of workers in the coal mining industry decreased by 2%, and the steel industry decreased by 1%. In view of this situation, it is not difficult to see why the pawnshop business in the coal mining areas is becoming more and more prosperous.

The West German bourgeois newspapers, especially the Federation of Industries, are daily promoting the myth of the "happiness of workers in the social market." However, the actual living conditions of the workers are quite different. Referring to last year's data, the food consumption of middle-level consumers, as statistically calculated by the official statistical bureau, has decreased in most major food categories.

The expenditure on clothing and furniture fabrics for working-class families decreased significantly in 1958. Compared with 1957, the amount of money spent on purchasing textiles by a middle-level consumer's family decreased by 3.8% in 1958. If price increases are taken into account, then the actual consumption has even decreased by 6.3%. The situation of workers purchasing consumer industrial products is also not in line with the bourgeois propaganda in recent years. The German Institute for Industrial Research calculated that in the autumn of 1958, only twenty-one refrigerators, twenty washing machines, fifty-two vacuum cleaners, and twelve cookers were owned by every hundred families in West Germany. If we take into account that out of the 24.3 million wage earners in West Germany, 11.1 million are workers, it is clear that they hardly have refrigerators, washing machines, and other appliances, while the wealthy class owns more and more of these things.

While monopoly capital is adding the disastrous consequences of economic deterioration to the working class, it is also not relaxing its efforts to intensify the seizure of every drop of profit in the current difficult situation. Capitalists lay off workers, but promote accelerated systems and increase labor intensity. In the first four months of 1959, output per hour increased by 7% compared to last year. The working hours of approximately six million workers are still higher than forty-eight hours per week. In the coal mining industry, miners have decreased by 9%, while labor productivity has increased by 9%. This greatly exceeds last year's growth rate of exploitation.

Due to the greatly intensified labor intensity and extremely poor working conditions, industrial accidents have increased year after year. According to the West German Social Democratic Party's "National Economic Newspaper": "Within one year, one out of every seven workers becomes a victim of unfortunate accidents in the enterprise." In the West German steel industry, one out of every six workers has an industrial accident. There were more than 1.13 million industrial accidents in 1950, but by 1958, there were more than 2.51 million. In the most recent year, the official registered unfortunate accidents in West German enterprises reached 3.6 million, with 7,500 people dying from accidents and 120,000 people suffering serious damage to their health. Most of these victims therefore lose their ability to work and live on meager relief funds.

In addition to industrial accidents, another consequence of the inhumane working conditions in West German industry is the early decline of a large number of laborers. The organ of the West German Trade Union Federation, "Arbeitswelt" (Labor World), reported on March 27, 1959: "In the past few years, in terms of social insurance, the pensions paid to those who are prematurely aged are twice the amount of pensions paid to the elderly over the age of sixty-five. From 1951 to 1957, more than one million workers were judged to have lost their labor force when they were at an age that could be described as being very productive. Behind this bland number lies a tragic picture full of human poverty."

The brutal exploitation of monopoly capital has aroused the West German working class's fighting spirit to fight for their own rights. Recently, the strike movement in West Germany has been surging, one after another. In West German enterprises, there is hardly a day without news of strikes and worker protests. Many workers who did not participate in strikes in the past are now participating in the ranks of the struggle. The workers of the Hanover Volkswagen factory, which was praised by capitalists as a "model enterprise," also held strikes to fight against the capitalists. Not long ago, more than 60,000 miners in the West German Ruhr area held a large-scale demonstration in Bonn, the seat of the West German government. This was the first time in the ten years since the establishment of the West German government. In these strike struggles, the solidarity of the West German working class and the solidarity between the East and West German working classes are also constantly strengthened. (Attached picture)

    西德工人阶级的困苦处境
    史德
    几年来，西德的经济曾经有过较快的发展，一些资产阶级的宣传机器就拼命吹嘘西德的“繁荣奇迹”。但是西德的这些所谓“经济繁荣”的基础之一，就是对工人阶级的残酷剥削。近年来，西德工人阶级生活的困苦越来越厉害。
    西德工人阶级遭受最大的困苦，就是失业和职业没有保障。今年晚春的官方报告说，空缺的工作第一次多于失业人数。但是，西德统计机关也不得不承认，1959年上半年工业上的就业人数比去年同期少1％。一些部门的就业人数减少得相当可观：煤矿开采部门1959年5月的就业人数比1958年5月减少了三万五千人。各部门减少的就业人数为：钢铁工业八千人，造船工业一万人，纺织工业四万四千人，服装工业七千人。西德工会联合会的机关刊“劳动世界”曾指出：“充分就业只不过是一种荒诞的空想，而大批解雇却是一场真正的恶梦。在这里，这些恶梦已经成为事实了。”
    解雇工人、缩短工时和实行临时工的结果是，工人从1959年1月到5月所作的工时甚至比去年同期少4％。这在煤矿工业中特别严重，从去年2月发生危机以来，已经实行了六百万个班次歇工，使矿工损失工资一亿三千多万马克。而从5月起，煤矿主更实行新的工资协定，对五十万矿工规定五日工作周。如果过去损失只涉及一部分矿工的话，那现在已经遍及所有矿工身上。
    但是即使那些在业工人，他们目前虽然还有比较固定的工资收入，但是由于工资追不上物价，这些工人的工资也是只能勉强糊口。从1958年2月到1959年2月，西德产业工人每周总工资名义上平均提高了3％。但据官方报告称，对于“中级消费者”来说，生活费用指数并没有提高，而对于所谓低级消费者来说，则上升了2％。因此，如果把捐税增加的负担计算在内，即使根据官方的报告，实际工资也几乎没有变化。而且正是由于日常生活中一些必不可少的商品的价格上涨，例如，马铃薯的价格涨了40％左右，牛肉的价格增长了7％，猪肉上涨10％，煤砖上涨2.4％，这一结论就更加正确。甚至西德官方统计报告也不得不承认，有部分西德工人的名义工资减少。从1958年2月到1959年2月采煤业工人的每周总收入降低了2％，钢铁工业降低了1％。鉴于这种情景便不难看出，为什么采煤区的当铺生意愈作愈兴隆了。
    西德资产阶级的报纸，特别是工业联合会，天天极力宣传“社会市场上工人的幸福”的神话。然而工人的实际生活情况却是另一种样子。参照去年的资料，官方统计局所统计的中等消费者的食物消费量，在大多数主要的食品方面都下降了。
    工人家庭的服装和家具用布匹的开支，在1958年已经显著地减少。1958年与1957年相比，一个中等消费者的人家用来购买纺织品的款项降低了3.8％。如果考虑到价格的上涨，那么实际消费量甚至下降了6.3％。工人购买消费工业品的情况也丝毫不符合资产阶级近几年来的宣传。德国工业研究所计算，1958年秋季西德每一百个家庭中只有二十一具冰箱，二十架洗衣机，五十二架吸尘器，十二架蒸煮机。如果考虑到在西德二千四百三十万靠工资吃饭的人中有一千一百一十万人是工人，那就很清楚，他们几乎没有冰箱、洗衣机等用具，而富有的阶层拥有的这些东西却愈来愈多。
    垄断资本一面把经济恶化的灾难性后果加在工人阶级的头上，而另一方面又不放松在当今困难情况下加紧攫取每一滴利润。资本家们解雇了工人，却推行加快制度，增加劳动强度。1959年头四个月，每小时的产量比去年上升7％。有大约六百万工人的工作时间每周仍然高于四十八小时。在煤矿工业中矿工减少了9％，而劳动生产率却提高了9％。这样就大大超过了去年剥削的增长速度。
    由于劳动强度大大加强，工人工作条件又极恶劣，工伤事故连年增加。据西德社会民主党的“国民经济报”说：“一年之内，每七个工人当中，就有一个成为企业中不幸事故的牺牲者”。而在西德的钢铁工业中，每六个工人中有一人发生工伤事故，在1950年曾经发生了一百一十三万多起工伤事故，但是到1958年发生了二百五十一万多起。而最近一年来，西德企业中官方登记的不幸事故更达到三百六十万起，有七千五百人因事故而死亡，有十二万人的健康受到严重损害。这些受害者大部分因此丧失了劳动能力，靠菲薄的救济金过活。
    除掉工伤事故以外，西德工业中非人的劳动条件的另一后果是大批劳动力的早衰。西德工会联合会的机关刊“劳动世界”1959年3月27日报道：“过去几年中，在社会保险方面，发给早衰者的养老金等于发给六十五岁以上老人的养老金的两倍。从1951到1957年，有一百万以上的劳动者在以其年岁说正是大有作为的时候就被判作为失去了劳动力。在这个索然无味的数字后面隐藏着的是一幅充满人类贫困的惨象。”
    垄断资本的残酷的剥削，激起了西德工人阶级争取自身权利的斗志。最近以来，西德的罢工运动风起云涌，连绵不断。在西德企业中几乎没有一天不传出发生罢工和工人抗议的消息。不少工人过去不参加罢工的，现在也参加了斗争的行列。曾被资本家誉为“模范企业”的汉诺威大众汽车厂的工人也举行罢工向资本家进行斗争了。不久以前，西德鲁尔区矿工六万多人到西德政府所在地波恩举行大规模示威游行。这是西德政府成立十年来的第一次。在这些罢工斗争中，西德工人阶级的团结和东西德工人阶级之间的团结也在不断加强。（附图片）
