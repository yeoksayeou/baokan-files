Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: Foreign Minister Chen Yi responded to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio's letter,

Suggests immediate talks between the two sides to comprehensively resolve the Overseas Chinese issue.

And immediately exchange instruments of ratification for the Treaty between China and Indonesia on the Question of Dual Nationality in Beijing.

At the same time, establish a joint committee in Jakarta, with our government appointing Ambassador Huang Zhen as the chief representative.

It is the responsibility of the Chinese government to protect the rights of Overseas Chinese; discriminatory restrictions imposed by Indonesia on Chinese representative institutions should be immediately lifted.

The Overseas Chinese issue can only be reasonably resolved by ensuring the protection of Overseas Chinese who wish to stay and fully caring for those who wish to leave.

The full text of Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter, dated December 24th, to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio is as follows:

To His Excellency Dr. Subandrio, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, Jakarta:

Thank you for your letter of December 11, 1959.

I am pleased to note that in your letter, Your Excellency expressed the desire of the Indonesian government to strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries, agreed to exchange instruments of ratification for the Treaty on the Question of Dual Nationality, would not obstruct Overseas Chinese who wish to return to China, and is prepared to consider providing assistance. However, I also noted that the Indonesian government did not express a clear attitude towards the Chinese government's proposal for both sides to immediately appoint representatives to conduct negotiations on comprehensively resolving the Overseas Chinese issue. Considering the serious situation of the current Overseas Chinese issue and in order to maintain the friendly relations between our two countries, the Chinese government earnestly hopes that the Indonesian government can adopt a positive and cooperative attitude and agree to immediate negotiations.

The Chinese government cannot agree with the arguments made in Your Excellency's letter regarding the role of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia and the roots of this anti-Chinese and discriminatory campaign, as well as the accusations against Chinese representative institutions in Indonesia. However, the Chinese government believes that endless disputes on these issues will only hinder the joint efforts of our two governments in resolving the urgent Overseas Chinese issue. Here, I will only make necessary clarifications on some of the most important facts.

The vast majority of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia are working people. For generations, they have lived in harmony with the Indonesian people and have contributed to Indonesia's economic development and national independence. They are fundamentally different from colonialists who use gunboat diplomacy as a backing and aim to oppress and plunder another country. Among the Overseas Chinese, there are indeed a very few whose behavior is not good. However, it is unjust to portray all Overseas Chinese as a monopoly group hindering Indonesia's economic development and to regard them as the main target of suppression and attack based solely on this point.

How to adjust the economic status of Overseas Chinese in the process of Indonesia's national economic development is a complex issue. Therefore, our two Foreign Ministers unanimously agreed in the joint communiqué issued on October 11th this year that "appropriate methods should be found to ensure that the resolution of this issue is conducive to Indonesia's economic development and that the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese are respected," and unanimously agreed that "the economic strength of Overseas Chinese will continue to play a beneficial role in Indonesia's economic development." In fact, the Chinese government has consistently urged Overseas Chinese in Indonesia to actively participate in local economic construction and has repeatedly suggested that the Indonesian government take appropriate steps to gradually guide Overseas Chinese capital from commerce to industry. Unfortunately, the regulations on banning alien small traders or retailers in rural areas have been used to focus on attacking Overseas Chinese, and even large-scale forced evictions have been carried out against Overseas Chinese, causing tens of thousands of Overseas Chinese to be ruined, displaced, and living in desperate situations. This situation not only does not conform to the principles put forward by the two Foreign Ministers in the joint communiqué, but also does not conform to the atmosphere of cooperation required by President Sukarno's political manifesto of August 17, 1959. In this situation, it is beyond reproach for Overseas Chinese to spontaneously rise up to complain about their difficulties and demand fair and reasonable treatment.

The Chinese government has consistently encouraged Overseas Chinese to abide by the laws of the Indonesian government and has never interfered in Indonesia's internal affairs. However, as Your Excellency also agreed in your letter, it is the responsibility of the government of the People's Republic of China to protect the rights of Overseas Chinese. In the case of serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, the Chinese representative institutions in Indonesia are fulfilling their duty to protect their own nationals, which cannot be interpreted as inciting or instigating Overseas Chinese to disobey the laws of the local government, and there is no reason to use this as an excuse to impose discriminatory restrictions on Chinese diplomatic missions. The Chinese government cannot accept the protest raised in Your Excellency's letter and once again requests the Indonesian government to immediately lift the discriminatory restrictions on Chinese representative institutions.

I think Your Excellency will share my concern about the seriousness of the current Overseas Chinese issue. At present, imperialism is using this situation to undermine the relations between our two countries and divert the struggle goals of the people of Asian countries. Therefore, whether the Overseas Chinese issue can be quickly, comprehensively, and properly resolved is not only related to the fate of millions of Overseas Chinese and the friendship between our two countries, but also to our common cause of opposing colonialism and safeguarding peace. It is precisely based on this understanding that I, on behalf of the Chinese government, put forward three suggestions for comprehensively resolving the Overseas Chinese issue in my last letter. Your Excellency put forward the Indonesian government's views on the Chinese government's three suggestions in your reply letter. In order to bring the views of both sides closer, I am willing to make further statements on behalf of the Chinese government.

Your Excellency stated in your letter that the Indonesian government agreed to immediately exchange instruments of ratification for the treaty between the two countries on the question of dual nationality and establish a joint committee, to which the Chinese government expresses its welcome. The Chinese government has always advocated exchanging instruments of ratification as soon as possible. Since the Indonesian government unilaterally promulgated an implementing regulation in June 1959 that was inconsistent with the principles of the treaty, disregarding the provisions of the exchange of notes between the two Prime Ministers, the Chinese government had requested the Indonesian government to clarify. Now, in order to implement the treaty as soon as possible, the Chinese government specifically suggests that both parties immediately exchange instruments of ratification in Beijing in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, and at the same time establish a joint committee in Jakarta in accordance with the exchange of notes between the two Prime Ministers. I formally inform Your Excellency that the Chinese government has appointed Ambassador Huang Zhen as the chief representative of the Chinese side in the joint committee.

The exchange of instruments of ratification and the establishment of a joint committee provides a legal basis and the necessary mechanisms for the implementation of the Treaty on the Question of Dual Nationality. This is indeed a welcome progress. However, under the current circumstances of the continued expansion of anti-Chinese and discriminatory activities in Indonesia, not only are those who originally wanted to choose Indonesian nationality feeling great concerns, but more importantly, those who can contribute to Indonesia's economic development also feel that their continued residence is bleak. The Chinese government has never had and will never have the intention of interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. However, I think Your Excellency will agree that issues involving the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese should be negotiated by both parties in accordance with the principles agreed upon long ago to seek reasonable solutions.

It should also be pointed out that a considerable number of Overseas Chinese are now unable to make a living or are unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia. Sending these Overseas Chinese back to China as soon as possible is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Sending Overseas Chinese back to China involves not only a series of meticulous organizational work, but also includes the protection of the interests and safety of Overseas Chinese. Therefore, the governments of the two countries should also immediately conduct consultations and make proper arrangements so that the work of sending these Overseas Chinese can begin as soon as possible.

The Chinese government has always believed that the Overseas Chinese issue can only be comprehensively and reasonably resolved by enabling Overseas Chinese who wish to stay in Indonesia to stay in a friendly atmosphere and under guaranteed conditions, and at the same time enabling Overseas Chinese who wish to leave Indonesia to leave with full care for their interests and safety.

Based on the above considerations, the Chinese government once again suggests that the governments of the two countries immediately appoint representatives to negotiate on the three suggestions for comprehensively resolving the Overseas Chinese issue put forward by the Chinese government and the corresponding suggestions put forward by the Indonesian government. After the Indonesian government agrees to this suggestion of the Chinese government, Ambassador Huang Zhen will, as the representative of the Chinese government, conduct negotiations with the representative appointed by the Indonesian government.

Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration.

The letter from Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio to Foreign Minister Chen Yi

The following is the full text of the letter written by Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio to Foreign Minister Chen Yi on December 11:

To His Excellency Chen Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China,

Your Excellency:

I received Your Excellency's letter of December 9, 1959, on December 10, and have studied it in depth.

My visit to Beijing in early October 1959 proved that the government of the Republic of Indonesia has consistently had the desire to strengthen the friendly relations between the governments and peoples of Indonesia and China.

During this short visit, my talks with Your Excellency, Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, Chairman Mao Zedong, and other Chinese leaders provided me with new material in the cause of consolidating the friendship between our two countries. In the above talks, we exchanged views on international issues involving the interests of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China. We also sought all avenues to closer relations between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China and deeply studied the resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue in Indonesia.

All of this is based on the spirit of the Bandung Conference and the Ten Principles. In the face of the interests between the two countries, if we are jointly based on the following two points, there will be no contradictions that undermine the friendly relations between the two countries and nations:

A. Make the same evaluation of basic issues.

B. Adopt a sincere attitude towards each other and not be affected by an atmosphere of suspicion or mutual accusation.

I can frankly say that the root of the difference in understanding lies in the fact that a relatively different assessment of the role of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia emerged during the Beijing talks.

The Indonesian people believe that the Indonesian people and government's strong proof of friendly feelings towards the Chinese people and government is that, despite the fact that most Overseas Chinese showed an unpleasant attitude towards the Indonesian nation's struggle for independence in the past, and despite the fact that they do not make enough contribution to the completion of Indonesia's revolution towards justice and prosperity, Indonesia still allows millions of Overseas Chinese to seek a proper livelihood in Indonesia.

On the contrary, the government of the People's Republic of China firmly believes that the Overseas Chinese in Indonesia have contributed to the Indonesian people in the past, and have also contributed to the Indonesian government's efforts to strive for development and progress. In order to illustrate the Overseas Chinese issue and everything connected with this issue, it is beneficial for me to explain the Overseas Chinese issue in detail from the beginning:

1. The regulations on closing alien retail stores in rural areas promulgated by the government of the Republic of Indonesia have been detailed in the Ministry of Distribution's Announcement No. 1 of September 2, 1959, and later included in Presidential Regulation No. 10 of 1959 promulgated on November 16, 1959. The government of the Republic of Indonesia considers it necessary to regard them as the first step towards achieving a guided economy.

This is also to protect the interests and lives of the majority of the Indonesian people from being harmed by the activities of groups that want to seek profits and wealth on the basis of the poverty of the majority of the Indonesian people.

2. When implementing the above regulations, the government of the Republic of Indonesia recognizes that all aspects of humanitarian principles must be respected. At the same time, the government is trying its best to guide the activities of the Chinese people from the commercial aspect to the production aspect that can benefit the entire Indonesian people.

3. Committees were established in various regions to implement the regulations. The task of these committees is to study together with the Overseas Chinese themselves in order to implement the regulations as well as possible.

4. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Overseas Chinese in various regions were unwilling to participate in the above-mentioned committees because, according to them, they received instructions from officials of the representative institution of the People's Republic of China in Jakarta to not participate in the above-mentioned committees.

The government of the Republic of Indonesia has definite evidence regarding the above instructions.

5. Despite the unwillingness of the Overseas Chinese leaders in rural areas to participate in the committees, the members of the above-mentioned committees still visited the Overseas Chinese parents and fully explained and explained to them the matters regarding the implementation of the above regulations.

They were also given the opportunity to personally visit the situation in the designated cities, if they were willing to move their businesses to cities outside the rural areas referred to in the regulations.

6. On the above basis, in general, it can be expected that the regulations on banning alien retailers in rural areas will be implemented in an orderly manner. Similarly, further actions to move the above-mentioned Overseas Chinese to cities and change the nature of their businesses can also be carried out in an atmosphere of mutual understanding.

7. Unexpectedly, such a phenomenon appeared: the above-mentioned good understanding turned into resistance to all the work carried out by the officials responsible for implementing the regulations.

This new attitude is due to the fact that the above-mentioned people received instructions from the representative institution of the People's Republic of China in Jakarta, that is, they were instructed not to comply with the orders of the local officials of the Republic of Indonesia. And they believe that the above measures of these officials are contrary to the policies of the Indonesian government.

8. It is this development that has become the root of all difficulties, one of which is to create a tense atmosphere in the relations between the people and the Overseas Chinese, and the implementation of the regulations on banning alien small traders in rural areas has been greatly obstructed and difficult, and it has also resulted in the resettlement work not being able to be carried out according to the government's true purpose.

9. The tense atmosphere has expanded to such an extent that events that the People's Republic of China often refers to as bloodshed have occurred.

The government wants to firmly state here that the above-mentioned events have been greatly exaggerated, just as the news released by the New China News Agency often emphasizes the exaggeration of everything that is not going well. Needless to say, the tendentious reporting of the New China News Agency also has a bad impact on the friendly relations between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China.

10. In order to illustrate the whole picture, the series of circumstances of the Cibaduyut incident are as follows:

For a period of time, Indonesian national instruments took action very patiently, but when two Overseas Chinese showed an extremely provocative and confrontational attitude, they couldn't help but lose their patience for a moment.

The above-mentioned officials beat them with canes. The materials of Dr. Cai Honglin (transliteration) of Sukabumi prove that the above two people only suffered minor injuries, and they were only hospitalized for a check-up. It must be pointed out that the government has taken steps against the above-mentioned officials.

11. In order to stabilize the situation, the government has allowed an official from the representative institution of the People's Republic of China to inspect the local situation accompanied by officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia.

It is regrettable that the above-mentioned official did not go there to stabilize the situation, but on the contrary gave speeches inciting Overseas Chinese to disobey the officials of the Republic of Indonesia.

In this way, the situation became even more acute and caused some unpleasant emotions towards the Overseas Chinese.

12. In addition, several officials from the representative institution of the People's Republic of China also traveled around, with the same purpose, that is, to verbally or distribute leaflets to encourage Overseas Chinese residents to oppose the orders of the officials of the Republic of Indonesia.

13. In this atmosphere, no tragic incidents of life being threatened or massacres have occurred, which should be proof of the awareness of the Indonesian people in evaluating their friendship with the People's Republic of China. At the same time, this also proves the civilization of the Indonesian people, which may be unparalleled in the world.

14. It is precisely in order to evaluate the tolerant and self-restrained attitude taken by Indonesia towards the Overseas Chinese that it is also necessary to appreciate the suppressed emotions of the Indonesian public towards the Overseas Chinese.

The seeds of anti-Chinese sentiment have existed since the Dutch era, and also during the Japanese colonial rule. Especially due to the behavior of the Overseas Chinese during the period after Indonesia's independence, the above-mentioned seeds have increased even more. There are several examples, such as the "Security Team" group - an organization armed by the Netherlands and used as their pawns to deal with the Indonesian independence struggle; after the end of the Japanese occupation, Overseas Chinese groups joyfully welcomed the restoration of Dutch rule; all of this is enough to prove that the Indonesian nation has legitimate reasons to abandon their feelings of establishing friendly relations and fraternal friendship with the Overseas Chinese.

15. Even so, the Indonesian government and people are not only willing to forget all the past actions of the Overseas Chinese, but also actively trying to make them true brothers of the Indonesian nation, thereby increasing the national strength of developing the Indonesian nation and people.

16. It is a pity that the Indonesian people's good wishes, attitudes, and actions have not received a corresponding response from the Overseas Chinese groups.

On the contrary, they disregard all the standards of humanity and justice, and take all manipulative means to control the economic life of the Indonesian people.

Overseas Chinese groups also resist the development of Indonesian economic life towards stability through smuggling, hoarding, and speculation.

As an example, I would like to raise the issue of gold trading, which is 100% in the hands of the Chinese. Although the market is stagnant and the government's gold reserves are rising, the price of gold rises every day, and sometimes soars. As a result of these practices, the value of the rupiah has declined abroad. The second example is the trade in salted fish, which is also monopolized by the Chinese. For the Indonesian people, salted fish is an important food. Due to the various manipulations of Chinese merchants, salted fish suddenly disappears from the market, but the government knows that the storage volume is large enough. We can cite many other examples to illustrate that some Chinese in Indonesia do not engage in commerce for a living in the usual way, they not only seek legitimate profits for themselves, but also take capitalist and monopolistic actions, while taking various means of manipulation and speculation to make them rich in a short period of time.

All of this should not only be regrettable, but also constitutes a danger to the happy life of the Indonesian nation and people.

17. We recognize that it is the responsibility of the government of the People's Republic of China to protect the rights of Overseas Chinese. However, I would like to emphasize that the Overseas Chinese society in Indonesia does not have the same characteristics and nature as the socialist society in China, and their activities do not have the same nature and characteristics as the socialist policies of the government of the People's Republic of China.

Therefore, in order to prevent the Indonesian people from having an inaccurate impression of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, that is, it seems that the government of the People's Republic of China is protecting groups in Indonesia with capitalist and monopolistic characteristics, we hope that the government of the People's Republic of China will conduct a more in-depth investigation of the actual situation in Indonesia, and not be affected by suspicion and exaggerated accusations alone.

18. The Indonesian people, no matter where they are, are very concerned and sympathetic to the Chinese revolution, which is not only to get rid of the shackles of foreign colonial rule and semi-colonial rule, but also to painstakingly transform the liberal economy into a socialist economy. I noticed that this change has made the Chinese people make major sacrifices, and sometimes these sacrifices make outsiders feel terrible and painful.

Turning back to the situation in Indonesia, I only ask that Overseas Chinese be willing to participate in and establish a guided economy with the socialist nature of Indonesia. The sacrifices we ask them to make are far smaller than the sacrifices made by the people of countries that we have seen transition from a liberal system to a socialist system.

19. I also take this opportunity to emphasize that the government of the Republic of Indonesia has been, is, and will continue to be willing to consolidate the friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people on the basis of the following understanding: the two nations should gradually seek to achieve prosperous and just progress in accordance with the principles of mutual respect and respect for each other's sovereignty.

An indispensable condition for friendship is that the two nations should help each other, or at least not hinder each other from taking the road to achieving the prosperity and justice of their own people.

20. The Indonesian government and people are patient and tolerant, especially towards the People's Republic of China, which can be proven by the fact that the government of the Republic of Indonesia has not taken any action against the official of the representative institution of the People's Republic of China who gave a speech inciting Overseas Chinese not to abide by the regulations issued by the government of the Republic of Indonesia.

Your Excellency must know that, according to the usual diplomatic norms, it is inappropriate for diplomatic officials to give speeches whose content not only interferes in internal affairs, but also goes beyond that and attacks relevant officials. If he wants to continue working as a diplomat in this country, then the above-mentioned behavior is even more inappropriate.

21. Regarding Your Excellency's three suggestions, I hereby state the opinion of the government of the Republic of Indonesia as follows:

A. Just like the initial attitude of the Republic of Indonesia, we have instructed Ambassador Soekardjo Wirjopranoto to exchange instruments of ratification since September 1959. This has not been achieved so far due to reasons on the part of the government of the People's Republic of China, and these reasons are incomprehensible to us. If the government of the People's Republic of China is now interested in exchanging instruments of ratification, the Indonesian government welcomes this.

B. Under the current circumstances, the government of the Republic of Indonesia believes that the implementation of the dual nationality agreement cannot eliminate the obstacles to the implementation of Presidential Regulation No. 10 of 1959 on banning alien small traders or retailers in rural areas.

If the government of the People's Republic of China, especially the Overseas Chinese community, accepts the implementation of the above-mentioned regulations, its significance is very important to the Indonesian government and people.

Only by adopting this method can a provision in the Subandrio-Chen Yi Joint Communiqué be implemented, which is to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese equally. If the Overseas Chinese side, with the help of the People's Republic of China, no longer shows a hostile attitude towards Presidential Regulation No. 10 of 1959, a good atmosphere can be created so that the implementation of the above-mentioned regulations can be brought into line with the speech of the President of the Republic of Indonesia on the political manifesto and the Subandrio-Chen Yi Joint Communiqué.

C. If those Overseas Chinese who cannot adapt to Indonesia's guided economy and guided democracy are willing to return to China, the Indonesian government will not obstruct them. For this purpose, the government of the Republic of Indonesia is prepared to consider providing assistance within the scope of the current regulations of the government of the Republic of Indonesia to facilitate those people to return to their motherland.

It can be added that, according to the current regulations, all their property can be sold to the government of the Republic of Indonesia, or sold to the institutions designated by the government of the Republic of Indonesia for this purpose.

D. According to the content of the dual nationality agreement, the Indonesian government is prepared to establish a committee to study the implementation of the above-mentioned dual nationality treaty together with the committee from the People's Republic of China.

Finally, when submitting this reply, the Indonesian government rejects the protests and incorrect accusations in Your Excellency's letter of December 9, 1959.

In addition, the Indonesian government firmly protests against the behavior of officials of the representative institution of the People's Republic of China in Jakarta who interfere in internal affairs that are entirely the responsibility of the government of the Republic of Indonesia.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia

### 建议双方立即会谈全面解决华侨问题

　　陈毅外长函复印度尼西亚苏班德里约外长
　　建议双方立即会谈全面解决华侨问题
　　并立即在北京互换中国印度尼西亚关于双重国籍问题条约的批准书
    同时在雅加达成立联合委员会，我国政府任命黄镇大使为首席代表
    保护华侨权利是我国政府的责任；印度尼西亚对我国代表机构的歧视性限制应即撤销
    只有使愿留下的华侨得到保障，使愿离开的华侨得到充分照顾，华侨问题才能合理解决
    新华社25日讯　中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅12月24日写信给印度尼西亚共和国外交部长苏班德里约，答复他12月11日的来信。陈毅外交部长的信全文如下：雅加达印度尼西亚共和国外交部长苏班德里约博士阁下阁下：
    感谢阁下1959年12月11日的来信。
    我高兴地注意到，阁下在来信中表示，印度尼西亚政府具有加强我们两国之间友好关系的愿望，同意互换双重国籍问题条约的批准书和成立联合委员会，对于愿意回国的华侨，不会加以阻挠，并且准备考虑给予援助，但是，我同时注意到，印度尼西亚政府对于中国政府提出的双方立即指派代表就全面解决华侨问题进行谈判的建议，没有表示明确的态度。考虑到当前华侨问题的严重形势，并且为了维护我们两国的友好关系，中国政府殷切地希望印度尼西亚政府能够采取积极和合作的态度，同意立即进行谈判。
    阁下在来信中对于华侨在印度尼西亚的作用和这次反华排华活动的根源所作的论断，以及对中国驻印度尼西亚的代表机构所提出的指责，都是中国政府所不能同意的。但是中国政府认为，在这些问题上进行无休止的争论，只会妨碍我们两国政府在解决迫切的华侨问题方面的共同努力。在这里，我只就一些最重要的事实作必要的说明。
    在印度尼西亚的华侨，绝大多数都是劳动人民。他们世世代代同印度尼西亚人民友好相处，对印度尼西亚的经济发展和民族独立事业出过一分力量，他们同以炮舰为后盾、以压迫和掠夺另一个国家为目的的殖民主义者是根本不同的。在华侨中，的确有极少数人的行为是不好的。但是，如果仅仅根据这一点，就把全体华侨说成是妨碍印度尼西亚经济发展的垄断集团，把他们当作是排挤和打击的主要目标，那是不公正的。
    在印度尼西亚发展民族经济的过程中如何调整华侨的经济地位，这是一个复杂的问题。因此，我们两国外长在今年10月11日发表的联合公报中一致认为，“应该寻找适当的方法，使这个问题的解决有利于印度尼西亚经济的发展和使华侨的正当权利和利益受到尊重”，并且一致同意，“华侨的经济力量将仍然对于印度尼西亚的经济发展起有益的作用”。事实上，中国政府一贯劝勉在印度尼西亚的华侨积极参加当地的经济建设，并且多次建议印度尼西亚政府能够采取妥善的步骤，逐步引导华侨资本从商业转向工业。不幸的是，关于取缔乡村地区外侨小商贩或零售商的条例竟被利用来集中打击华侨，甚至对华侨进行了大规模的武力逼迁，使成千上万的华侨倾家荡产，流离失所，生活陷于绝境。这种情况不仅不符合两国外长在联合公报中提出的原则，也不符合苏加诺总统阁下在1959年8月17日的政治宣言中所要求保持的合作气氛。在这种情况下，华侨自发地起来申诉困难，要求得到公正合理的待遇，是无可非议的。
    中国政府一贯勉励华侨遵守印度尼西亚政府的法令，从不干涉印度尼西亚的内政。但是，正如阁下在来信中也同意的，保护华侨的权利是中华人民共和国政府的责任。在华侨的正当权利和利益受到严重损害的情况下，中国驻印度尼西亚的代表机构履行它们保护本国侨民的职责，无论如何也不能解释为进行煽动，挑唆华侨违抗当地政府的法令，更没有理由以此为借口对中国的外交代表机构实行歧视性的限制。中国政府不能接受阁下在来信中提出的抗议，并且再一次要求印度尼西亚政府立即撤销对中国的代表机构的歧视性限制。
    我想阁下对于当前华侨问题的严重性会和我具有同感。目前，帝国主义正在利用这种形势破坏我们两国的关系，转移亚洲各国人民的斗争目标。因此，华侨问题能否迅速获得全面的和妥善的解决，不仅关系到成百万华侨的命运和我们两国的友谊，而且也关系到我们反对殖民主义和维护和平的共同事业。正是基于这种认识，我在上次的信中代表中国政府提出了全面解决华侨问题的三点建议。阁下在复信中对于中国政府的三点建议提出了印度尼西亚政府的意见。为了使双方的意见更加接近，我愿意代表中国政府作进一步的申述。
    阁下在来信中表示，印度尼西亚政府同意立即互换两国关于双重国籍问题条约的批准书和成立联合委员会，中国政府对此表示欢迎。中国政府一向主张尽早互换批准书。由于印度尼西亚政府在1959年6月，不顾两国总理换文的规定，单方面颁布了一项同条约的原则不相符合的实施条例，中国政府曾经要求印度尼西亚政府作出澄清。现在，为了使条约早日得到实施，中国政府具体建议，双方立即根据条约的规定在北京互换批准书，同时根据两国总理的换文在雅加达成立联合委员会。我正式通知阁下，中国政府任命黄镇大使为联合委员会中中国方面的首席代表。
    双方互换了批准书和成立了联合委员会，使双重国籍问题条约的实施有了法律基础和必要的机构。这诚然是一个可喜的进步。但是，目前在印度尼西亚反华排华活动继续扩大的情况下，不仅原来想选择印度尼西亚国籍的人感到极大的顾虑，而且更重要的是，那些能够对印度尼西亚的经济发展作出贡献的人，也觉得继续居留下去前途茫茫。中国政府从来没有、今后也没有干涉印度尼西亚内政的意思。但是，涉及华侨的正当权利和利益的问题，我想阁下也会同意，应该由双方根据早已协议的原则进行谈判，求得合理的解决。
    还需要指出，现在已经有为数相当多的华侨无法谋生或者不愿意继续在印度尼西亚居留。尽快地把这些华侨遣送回国，是当前迫切需要解决的问题。遣送华侨回国，不仅牵涉到一系列细致的组织工作，而且也包含保护华侨的利益和安全的问题。因此，两国政府也应该立即进行商谈，作出妥善的安排，使遣送这些华侨的工作早日开始。
    中国政府始终认为，只有使愿意留在印度尼西亚的华侨能够在友好的气氛和有保障的条件下留下来，同时使愿意离开印度尼西亚的华侨在充分照顾他们的利益和安全的条件下离开，华侨问题才能得到全面的和合理的解决。
    根据上述的种种考虑，中国政府再一次建议，两国政府立即指派代表就中国政府提出的全面解决华侨问题的三点建议和印度尼西亚政府提出的相应建议进行谈判。在印度尼西亚政府同意中国政府这项建议之后，黄镇大使将作为中国政府的代表，同印度尼西亚政府所指派的代表进行谈判。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
                  中华人民共和国外交部长　陈毅（签字）
                            一九五九年十二月二十四日于北京
　　印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约给陈毅外长的信
    下面是印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约12月11日写给陈毅外交部长的信的全文：中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅阁下，阁下：
    我于12月10日收到阁下1959年12月9日来信，并已深入研究。
    1959年10月初我到北京的访问证明，印度尼西亚共和国政府一贯具有加强印度尼西亚和中国两国政府和人民之间的友好关系的愿望。
    在这次短期的访问中，我同阁下本人、周恩来总理阁下、毛泽东主席阁下以及中国其他领导人的会谈，在巩固我们两国友谊的事业方面，给我提供了新的材料。在上述会谈中，我们就涉及印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国的利益的国际问题交换了意见。我们也寻找一切途径来密切印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国之间的关系，并且深入地研究了解决在印度尼西亚的华侨问题。
    这一切都是基于万隆会议的精神和十项原则。在面对两国之间的利益中，如果我们共同基于如下两点，就不致产生损害两个国家和民族之间的友好关系的任何一种矛盾：
    甲、对基本问题作相同的评价。
    乙、彼此采取真诚的态度，并且不受到猜疑或互相指责的气氛的影响。
    我可以坦率地说，在理解上的分歧的根源在于，在北京会谈期间对华侨在印度尼西亚的作用出现了比较不同的估价。
    印度尼西亚人民认为，印度尼西亚人民和政府对中国人民和政府的友好感情的有力证明是：尽管大多数华侨在过去对印度尼西亚民族的独立斗争表现了令人不大愉快的态度，尽管目前他们对完成印度尼西亚走向公正和繁荣的革命没有足够地作出贡献，印度尼西亚还是允许数百万华侨在印度尼西亚谋求适当的生计。
    相反的，中华人民共和国政府坚决认为，在印度尼西亚的华侨过去对印度尼西亚人民是有功劳的，而且对印度尼西亚共和国政府争取发展和进步的努力也是有功劳的。为了说明华侨问题以及同这个问题有联系的一切事情，我从头详细说明华侨问题是有好处的：
    1、印度尼西亚共和国政府颁布的关于关闭乡村地区的外侨零售商店的条例，已在分配部长的1959年9月2日第一号公告中作了详细规定，后来又包括在1959年11月16日颁布的59年第十号总统条例，印度尼西亚共和国政府认为有必要将它们看成是走向实现有领导的经济的第一步。
    这也是为了保护印度尼西亚大多数人民的利益和生活，以免受到那些想在印度尼西亚大多数人民贫困的基础上寻找利润和财富的集团的活动的损害。
    2、在实施上述条例时，印度尼西亚共和国政府认识到，应该尊重人道主义原则的各个方面必须尊崇。同时，政府正尽力引导中国人的活动从商业方面转向能使整个印度尼西亚人民分享利益的生产方面。
    3、在各地区实施该条例的时候成立了委员会，这些委员会的任务是同华侨本身共同研究，以便尽好地实施该条例。
    4、可惜得很，各地区的华侨领导人不愿意参加上述委员会，因为据他们说，他们接到了中华人民共和国驻雅加达代表机构官员的指示，要他们不参加上述委员会。
    印度尼西亚共和国政府掌握了关于上述指示的确实的证据。
    5、尽管乡村地区的华侨领导人不愿意参加委员会，上述委员会的委员还是访问了华侨家长们，并且将实施上述条例的事项向他们作了充分的说明和解释。
    同时也给他们机会亲自去参观被指定的城市的情况，如果他们愿意把自己的企业迁移到该条例所指的乡村以外的城市的话。
    6、在上述基础上，一般地说，可以期望，关于取缔乡村地区外侨零售商的条例将能够有秩序付诸实行。同样的，把上述华侨迁移到城市以及改变他们的业务性质的进一步的行动，也能够在互相谅解的气氛中进行。
    7、出乎意料之外，出现了这样的现象：上述良好的谅解变成了对负责执行条例的官员所进行的一切工作的抗拒。
    这种新的态度是由于上述人士接到了中华人民共和国驻雅加达的代表机构的指示，即指示他们不遵从印度尼西亚共和国地方官员的命令。并且认为这些官员的上述措施同印度尼西亚政府的政策相违背。
    8、正是这种发展情况成了一切困难的根源，其中的一个困难是造成人民和华侨之间的关系的紧张气氛，取缔乡村地区外侨小商贩的条例的实施受到很大的阻挠和困难，而且也造成这样的后果：收容工作不能够按照政府的真正的目的来进行。
    9、紧张气氛扩大到这样的程度，以致发生了中华人民共和国方面所经常称之为流血事件的事件。
    政府要在这里坚决申明，上述事件被大大地加以夸大了，正如新华通讯社所发出的消息也是经常着重夸大一切不大顺利的事情。这里不用说，新华社那种具有倾向性的报道对印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国之间的友好关系也有不大好的影响。
    10、为了说明全貌，芝巴德事件的一系列情况如下：
    印度尼西亚共和国国家工具一个时期曾经非常耐心地采取行动，但是当两名华侨表现出极其挑衅和对抗的态度时，它们就一时忍耐不住。
    上述官员用手杖打他们。苏加巫眉的蔡鸿林（译音——译注）医生的材料证明，上述两人只受轻伤，而且在医院留医也只是为了检查病情。必须指出，政府已经对上述官员采取步骤。
    11、为了稳定情况，所以政府曾允许中华人民共和国代表机构的一名官员在印度尼西亚共和国外交部官员陪同下视察当地情况。
    很遗憾的是，上述官员不是到那里去稳定情况，而是相反地发表了煽动华侨不服从印度尼西亚共和国官员的演说。
    这样，情况就更加尖锐，而且引起了对华侨的某些不愉快的情绪。
    12、此外，中华人民共和国代表机构的若干官员还到处奔走，他们抱有同样的目的，即以口头或散发传单的方式怂恿华侨居民反对印度尼西亚共和国官员们的命令。
    13、在这种气氛下，并没有发生人命遭受威胁或屠杀的令人痛心的事件，这应该是证明了印度尼西亚人民在评价对中华人民共和国的友谊方面的觉悟。同时，这也证明了印度尼西亚人民的文明，而这种文明可能是举世无双的。
    14、正是为了评价印度尼西亚方面对华侨所采取的容忍和克己的态度，也有必要体会印度尼西亚公众心中压抑着的对华侨的情绪。
    排华情绪的种子从荷兰时代起就有，在日本殖民统治时期也有。尤其是由于华侨在印度尼西亚取得独立后的时期中的行为，上述种子就更增加了。有若干例子，如“保安队”团体——一个由荷兰武装起来的组织，并成为他们用来对付印度尼西亚独立斗争的爪牙；在日本占领结束后，华侨各集团兴高采烈地欢迎恢复荷兰的统治；这一切足以证明，印度尼西亚民族有正当的理由抛弃他们同华侨建立友好关系和兄弟般情谊的感情。
    15、虽然如此，印度尼西亚政府和人民不仅愿意忘掉华侨过去的一切行为，而且还积极设法使他们变为印度尼西亚民族的真正的兄弟，从而增加发展印度尼西亚国家和人民的民族力量。
    16、很可惜印度尼西亚人民的这个善良的愿望、态度和行动并没有得到华侨集团的相应的答复。
    相反的，他们蔑视人道的和公正的一切准则，采取一切操纵手段控制了印度尼西亚人民的经济生活。
    华侨集团还通过走私、囤积和投机来反抗印度尼西亚经济生活朝向稳定方面发展。
    作为例子，我愿提出黄金买卖的问题，这种买卖百分之百掌握在中国人手里。虽然市面停滞，而且政府的黄金储备在上升，但黄金的价格却每天上涨，而且有时暴涨。由于这些做法的结果，在国外盾的价值下降了。第二个例子是咸鱼的买卖，这也为中国人所垄断。对印度尼西亚人民来说，咸鱼是重要的食品。由于中国商人的各种操纵，咸鱼会突然地在市场上看不见，但是政府知道储存量是够大的。我们能够举出许多其他的例子来说明，在印度尼西亚的一部分中国人不是用通常的方式来从事商业为生，他们不仅是为自己谋取正当的利润，而且还采取资本主义和垄断的行为，同时采取各种操纵和投机的手段，来使他们在短时间内发财致富。
    这一切不仅应当使人感到遗憾，而且构成对印度尼西亚国家和人民的幸福生活的危险。
    17、我们认识到，保护华侨的权利是中华人民共和国政府的责任。但是，我愿意着重指出，在印度尼西亚的华侨社会不具有同中国的社会主义社会相同的特性和性质，而他们的活动也不具有同中华人民共和国政府的社会主义政策相同的性质和特性。
    因此，为了防止印度尼西亚人民对中华人民共和国政府和人民产生不大正确的印象，即似乎中华人民共和国政府是保护在印度尼西亚的具有资本主义和垄断的性质的集团，我们希望中华人民共和国政府对印度尼西亚的实际情况作更深入的考察，而不要仅仅受到猜疑和夸大指责的影响。
    18、印度尼西亚人民，不论他们在那里，都十分关心和同情地注视着中国的革命，这个革命不仅是摆脱外国的殖民统治和半殖民地统治的桎梏，而且也是千辛万苦地把自由主义经济改变为社会主义经济。我注意到这个改变已经使中国人民付出了重大的牺牲，这种牺牲有时使外人感到是可怕的牺牲和痛苦。
    回头谈谈印度尼西亚的情况，我只要求华侨愿意参加并建立印度尼西亚式的社会主义性质的有领导的经济。我们要求他们所作的牺牲远比我们看到的从自由主义制度过渡到社会主义制度的国家的人民所作的牺牲来得小。
    19、我也利用这个机会来着重指出，印度尼西亚共和国政府过去、现在和将来一直愿意在以下谅解的基础上巩固印度尼西亚人民和中国人民之间的友谊：两个民族应该根据互相尊敬和尊重彼此的主权的原则来逐步寻求实现繁荣和公正的进步。
    友谊的绝不可少的条件是：两个民族应该互相帮助，或者至少不妨碍对方走实现本国人民的繁荣和公正的道路。
    20、印度尼西亚政府和人民是耐心的和容忍的，特别对中华人民共和国是如此，这可以从下述事实得到证明，即对发表讲话煽动华侨不遵守印度尼西亚共和国政府发布的条例的那位中华人民共和国代表机构的官员，印度尼西亚共和国政府并没有采取任何行动。
    阁下一定知道，按照通常的外交准则，外交官员发表其内容不仅干涉内政，而且超过这点，攻击有关官员的演说，是不适宜的。如果他想在这个国家当外交官继续工作，那么，上述行为就更不适宜。
    21、关于阁下的三点建议，我在此说明印度尼西亚共和国政府的意见如下：
    甲、正像印度尼西亚共和国起初的态度那样，我们自1959年9月以来就已指示苏加佐·维约普拉诺托大使进行批准书的互换，这点迄今未能实现，是由于中华人民共和国政府方面的原因，这些原因是我们所不明白的。如果中华人民共和国政府现在对互换批准书已有兴趣，印度尼西亚政府欢迎这点。
    乙、在目前的情况下，印度尼西亚共和国政府认为双重国籍协定的实施还不能消除实施关于取缔乡村地区外侨小商贩或零售商的1959年第十号总统条例的障碍。
    如果中华人民共和国政府，特别是华侨社会接受上述条例的实施，对印度尼西亚政府和人民来说，其意义是非常重要的。
    只有采取这种办法，苏班德里约—陈毅联合公报中的一项条文才能付诸实现，这项条文就是关于一视同仁地保护华侨的正当的权利和利益。如果华侨方面，在中华人民共和国的帮助下，不再对1959年第十号总统条例表现敌对态度，就可以创造良好的气氛，以便将上述条例的实施纳入符合于印度尼西亚共和国总统所发表的关于政治宣言的演讲内容以及苏班德里约—陈毅联合公报的轨道。
    丙、如果那些不能适应印度尼西亚的有领导的经济和有领导的民主的华侨愿意返回中国，印度尼西亚政府不会加以阻挠。为了这个目的，印度尼西亚共和国政府在现行的印度尼西亚共和国政府条例的范围内准备考虑给予援助，以便利那些人返回他们的祖国。
    可以补充指出，根据现行条例，他们的一切财产可以卖给印度尼西亚共和国政府，或者卖给印度尼西亚共和国政府为此目的而指定的机构。
    丁、根据双重国籍协定的内容，印度尼西亚政府准备成立委员会，以便同中华人民共和国方面的委员会一起研究上述双重国籍条约的实施。
    最后，印度尼西亚政府在提交本复照的时候，拒绝阁下1959年12月9日来信中的抗议和不正确的指责。
    此外，对中华人民共和国驻雅加达代表机构的官员干涉完全应由印度尼西亚共和国政府负责的内政问题的行为，印度尼西亚共和国政府坚决地提出抗议。
                      印度尼西亚共和国外交部长
                                    苏班德里约博士
                          一九五九年十二月十一日于雅加达
