Factories and Mines Must Also Focus on Transportation

With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the issue of transportation is becoming increasingly important. The production of many factories and mines is growing by a quarter, a third, or even doubling or multiplying in a year. As output increases, more raw materials need to be transported in, and more products need to be transported out. While the national transportation work needs to catch up, the internal transportation of factories and mines must also catch up. Strengthening the internal transportation and loading/unloading work of factories and mines can not only ensure the leap forward in the production of the enterprise itself but also accelerate the turnover of railway vehicles and other professional transportation departments' means of transport, better meeting the needs of production development in all aspects.

When the internal transportation and loading/unloading capacity of factories and mines contradicts the volume of transportation, what should be done? Some people "look outward," simply asking superiors for vehicles and loading/unloading workers, and requesting support from local transportation departments. The support of superiors and the assistance of society are sometimes indispensable; however, simply relying on superiors and external assistance will unnecessarily increase the burden on professional transportation departments, affecting other transportation tasks, and sometimes such wishes will not be fulfilled. The best way is to first "look inward," relying mainly on self-reliance, and mobilize the masses to tap the internal transportation potential of the enterprise. In fact, the internal transportation potential of enterprises is very large. Generally, enterprises have their own dedicated vehicles and transportation workers. If they are organized and used reasonably, transportation efficiency can be improved. As for vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, manufacturing simple equipment, realizing transportation mechanization, or further improving the level of mechanization, transportation capacity can be greatly improved.

To fully tap the transportation potential of enterprises and do a good job in the internal transportation and loading/unloading work of factories and mines, the key lies in the fact that the enterprise leaders must not only focus on production but also focus on transportation, and effectively strengthen the leadership of transportation work. At present, the leaders of a few factories and mines do not pay enough attention to internal transportation. They believe that factories and mines are production units, and as long as production is well managed, that's enough. As for transportation, that is the business of the transportation department. This one-sided view is not conducive to production. Production and transportation, especially internal transportation of factories and mines, are closely linked. Raw materials must be transported to the workshop before they can be used for production, and products must be transported out in time to play their role and ensure that production continues normally in the factory. Rapid production development will place new demands on transportation work. Only when enterprise leaders personally take the initiative can these new problems be solved in a timely manner. In the past, the leaders of Tangshan Steel Plant did not adequately understand the importance of transportation in production, focusing only on production and neglecting internal transportation. They failed to solve the contradiction between transportation capacity and production development in a timely manner, resulting in blocked cargo spaces, raw materials not being transported in, and products and slag not being transported out, putting production in a passive position. Later, the factory decided to assign a Party Committee secretary and a deputy director to manage transportation work; the factory Party Committee and the workshop general branch all included internal transportation work on their regular agenda, and promptly studied and resolved problems in transportation. As a result, although the factory's steel production level in November increased by 1.8 times compared to July, transportation work was able to adapt.

When leaders pay attention to transportation work, they should actively mobilize the masses and adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. This is the only way to effectively improve transportation capacity. In the technical innovation movement, the workers of Tangshan Steel Plant used waste materials and old machinery to manufacture many kinds of simple transportation machinery and transportation tools, so the transportation and loading/unloading efficiency of the entire factory increased by two or three times.

Strengthening the cooperation between production workshops and transportation departments is an important link in doing a good job in factory and mine transportation. This requires educating the workers in the production workshops to create convenient conditions for transportation work everywhere in the production process, and educating the workers in the transportation departments to think about production everywhere and do everything possible to ensure the supply of raw materials and the timely transportation of products. In addition, factory and mine enterprises should also strengthen cooperation. For example, strengthening contact with transportation departments, sharing railway special lines, and adjusting the use of locomotives, vehicles, automobiles, and large-scale lifting machinery can all give full play to the role of transportation equipment and improve transportation efficiency.

Continuous leap forward in production requires continuous leap forward in transportation. It is hoped that all factories and mines can, like Tangshan Steel Plant, have secretaries and directors personally take action and vigorously grasp the internal transportation and loading/unloading work of factories and mines.

    厂矿也要抓运输
    随着工农业生产的迅速发展，交通运输问题越来越显得重要了。许多厂矿的生产，都是一年增长四分之一、三分之一，甚至一倍、几倍。产量增加了，就要运进更多的原料材料，运出更多的产品。全国的交通运输工作要赶上去，厂矿内部的运输也要赶上去。厂矿内部的运输、装卸工作加强了，既能保证本企业生产跃进，又能加速铁路车辆和其他专业运输部门交通工具的周转，更好地满足各方面生产发展的需要。
    当厂矿内部的运输、装卸能力同运输量发生矛盾的时候，怎么办？有的人“眼睛向外”，单纯向上级要车辆，要装卸工人，向地方交通运输部门请求支援。上级的支持、社会的支援，有时候是不可少的；但是，单纯依赖上级、依靠外援，就会不必要地增加专业运输部门的负担，影响其他方面的运输任务，有时候这种愿望还会落空。最好的办法还是要首先“眼睛向内”，以自力更生为主，发动群众挖掘企业内部的运输潜力。事实上，企业内部的运输潜力是很大的。一般企业都有自己的专用车辆、运输工人，合理地组织，合理地使用，可以提高运输效率。至于大搞技术革新和技术革命，制造简易设备，实现运输土机械化，或者进一步提高机械化的水平，就能更大地提高运输能力。
    要充分挖掘企业运输潜力，搞好厂矿内部的运输、装卸工作，关键在于企业领导人员既要抓生产又要抓运输，切实加强对运输工作的领导。目前，少数厂矿的领导人员对于厂内运输还重视不够。他们认为厂矿是生产单位，只要把生产管好就行了，至于运输那是运输部门的事。这种片面观点，对于生产是不利的。生产同运输、特别是厂矿内部的运输有着紧密的联系。原材料运到车间才能用于生产，产品及时运出去才能发挥作用，才能保证厂内继续正常进行生产。生产迅速发展，会给运输工作提出新的要求。只有企业领导人员亲自动手去抓，才能及时解决这些新的问题。唐山钢厂的领导人员过去由于对运输在生产中的重要作用认识不足，只顾生产，忽视厂内运输，没有及时解决运输能力同生产发展不相适应的矛盾，以致货位堵塞，原料运不进来，产品，渣子运不出去，生产陷于被动。后来，厂里确定由一名党委书记和一名副厂长管运输工作；工厂党委和车间总支都把厂内运输工作列入经常的议事日程，及时研究和解决运输中的问题。结果，11月份这个厂钢的生产水平虽然比7月份猛增了一点八倍，运输工作也能适应。
    领导人员重视了运输工作，就要积极发动群众，采取土洋结合的办法，大搞技术革新和技术革命。这样才能有效地提高运输能力。唐山钢厂职工在技术革新运动中，用废料、旧机械制造出许多种简易的运输机械和运输工具，全厂运输和装卸效率因此分别提高了两三倍。
    加强生产车间和运输部门的协作，是办好厂矿运输工作的一个重要环节。这就要教育生产车间的工人在生产过程中处处为运输工作创造方便条件，教育运输部门的工人处处为生产着想，千方百计保证原料供应和产品及时外运。另外，厂矿企业之间也应该加强协作。如加强同交通部门的联系，共用铁路专用线，调剂使用机车车辆、汽车和大型起重机械等，都可以充分发挥运输设备的作用，提高运输效率。
    生产不断跃进要求运输不断跃进。希望各厂矿都能像唐山钢厂一样，书记、厂长亲自动手，大抓厂矿内部的运输、装卸工作。
