　　A Method for Building Fertilizer Quickly, Efficiently, and Economically
　　Yongshan Commune Extracts Ammonia from Smoke

　　(By Our Newspaper) The Yongshan Commune in Leping County, Jiangxi Province, adhering to the principle of "native methods as the foundation, combining native and foreign methods," has successfully extracted ammonia from waste smoke using "three kilns and one stove," opening up an important avenue for rural areas to build chemical fertilizer on a large scale. Extracting ammonia from waste smoke using "three kilns and one stove" involves collecting the waste smoke emitted from lime kilns, brick and tile kilns, charcoal kilns, and kitchen stoves, and using it to produce various chemical fertilizers such as ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium calcium nitrate (see diagram for specific methods). These fertilizers are all high-quality, and have the advantages of being locally sourced, locally supplied, requiring simple equipment, easy to operate, and low cost. The cadres and masses of the commune composed a song of praise: "The method of three kilns and one stove is good, everyone gets involved; natural fertilizer sources are inexhaustible, waste gas utilization expands resources, locally sourced and locally produced, quick, efficient and economical blitz; accumulating small amounts into mountains, a good harvest is guaranteed next year." At the beginning of Yongshan Commune's use of "three kilns and one stove" to extract ammonia from waste smoke, some people believed that the fertilizer produced by this method would not have much effect; others thought it was too complicated and troublesome, and there were no conditions to do it, saying: "Extracting ammonia from smoke is too troublesome, it is better to collect cow dung every day." However, the commune party committee attached great importance to this issue, and the secretary personally took charge, leading the work, and drawing some cadres and experienced commune members from the major brigades to experiment and summarize at the same time. The results of the trial production showed that each brick and tile kiln can produce about 1,000 catties of ammonium calcium nitrate or about 200 catties of ammonium bicarbonate, or 200 catties of liquid ammonium sulfate per day; each lime kiln can produce about 60 catties of liquid ammonium bicarbonate and 100 catties of ammonium calcium nitrate per day; each charcoal kiln can produce about 1,000 catties of ammonium calcium nitrate and about 50 catties of charcoal juice per day; each kitchen stove can produce about 400 catties of ammonium calcium nitrate per day.

　　Experimental results proved that crops fertilized with ammonia extracted from smoke not only had thick stalks and dark, lush leaves within ten days, but also grew much taller than crops that had not been fertilized.

　　Now Yongshan Commune is vigorously promoting the advanced fertilizer accumulation method of extracting ammonia from the waste smoke of three kilns and one stove, striving to utilize all 22 lime kilns, 6 brick and tile kilns, more than 70 charcoal kilns and all usable kitchen stoves in the commune. It is estimated that 76 million catties of fertilizers such as ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium calcium nitrate can be produced throughout the year, saving more than 24,300 yuan in fertilizer purchase funds.

　　Introduction to "Extracting Ammonia from Smoke from Three Kilns and One Stove"

　　Burning lime, bricks and tiles, and charcoal requires coal or firewood. Coal contains more than 1% nitrogen and also contains sulfur; firewood also contains a lot of nitrogen. These substances are decomposed during combustion to produce gases such as ammonia, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. These gases can dissolve in water under certain conditions and undergo chemical reactions to become ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium sulfate. Therefore, the method of "extracting ammonia from smoke from three kilns and one stove" is both simple and easy. In summary, there are two methods for extracting ammonia from smoke: one is to absorb with water; the other is to absorb with soil. The specific methods are:

　　(1) Lime kiln produces ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium calcium nitrate, as shown in Figure (1):

　　Build a horizontal chimney (2) on the upper part of the lime kiln (1), and the chimney is connected to the absorption tank (3). There should be four to five consecutive absorption tanks to ensure comprehensive absorption of ammonia in the smoke. Put clean water into the absorption tank, the height should not exceed the flue pipe (4), and the tank opening should be tightly sealed. When burning lime, cover the lime kiln opening with an iron cover to allow the smoke to enter the horizontal chimney and then enter the absorption tank. After about ten hours, the water in the absorption tank absorbs a lot of ammonia and carbon dioxide in the smoke and undergoes a chemical reaction to become ammonium bicarbonate. Then, it can be taken out for application, and then put clean water in the absorption tank for absorption again.

　　In order to fully absorb the ammonia in the smoke, a smoking soil platform (5) should be built at the exit of the chimney, with moist soil piled on it. The chimney exit should be built in a well shape, staggered to maintain a certain gap, so that all the piled soil can be smoked and a part of the smoke can escape, so as not to hinder the burning of lime. After smoking for one day and one night, it can be taken out, crushed and used.

　　(2) Brick and tile kiln to extract ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium sulfate, as shown in Figure (2):

　　Build a horizontal chimney (2) on the chimney (1) of the brick and tile kiln, and then build a straight chimney (3), which is the absorption chimney. Let the smoke be discharged upwards. The bottom of the absorption chimney is built into a slope, and the sprayed water absorbs the ammonia in the smoke and becomes ammonium bicarbonate or ammonium sulfate and flows into the residual water bucket (4). The water in the residual water bucket is sprayed into the absorption chimney for six to seven cycles, and then it can be taken for application.

　　In addition, soil can also be used to absorb the ammonia in the smoke to make ammonium calcium nitrate.

　　The method is: pile soil around the chimney of the brick and tile kiln, low in the middle and high around, or build a smoking soil bucket that is three feet long and two and a half feet wide. Build a well shape on the chimney opening, maintaining a certain gap to allow the smoke to escape, and then pile soil in the smoking soil bucket to smoke, take it out and crush it after about one day and one night, and then it can be used.

　　(3) Charcoal kiln to make ammonium calcium nitrate.

　　Use bricks to build a well shape on the chimney of the charcoal kiln, but it should be noted that two bricks should be placed horizontally on the chimney to prevent soil from falling into the chimney. The rest is the same as making ammonium calcium nitrate in a brick and tile kiln.

　　According to the experience of the masses, a lot of juice seeps out during the burning of charcoal. About 50 to 100 catties can seep out for each kiln of charcoal burned. After experiments, the juice was poured on the grass, and the grass was able to grow after it withered, and it grew better than other grass.

　　The method of collecting juice is: tighten the bottom of the charcoal kiln, dig ditches around it, and install a bamboo tube on the side of the kiln to allow the juice to flow into the bamboo tube and then into the water bucket outside the kiln.

　　(4) Kitchen stove chimney to make ammonium calcium nitrate, as shown in Figure (3):

　　Build a horizontal chimney (2) on the original chimney (1), leading to the smoking soil platform (3) outside the wall. The height of the chimney exit should be similar to the smoking soil platform. On the smoking soil platform at the chimney exit, build a well-shaped brick, and leave a certain gap to allow the smoke to escape evenly, and then pile soil on it, smoke it for one day and one night, take it out and crush it for use.

　　In short, the installation design of "extracting ammonia from smoke from three kilns and one stove" should be adapted to local conditions, and the ammonia extraction method in the region should be designed according to different regional conditions, and cannot be mechanically applied, so as to ensure better absorption of ammonia and manufacture fertilizers with higher fertilizer efficiency and larger quantities.

　　一种多快好省造化肥的办法
    涌山公社从烟中取氨
　　本报讯　江西乐平县涌山公社坚持“以土为主，土洋结合”方针，利用三窑一灶废烟取氨成功，为农村大造化学肥料开辟了一条重要的途径。利用三窑一灶废烟取氨，就是利用石灰窑、砖瓦窑、木炭窑和锅灶烟囱跑出的废烟，把它收起来，　制成碳酸氢铵、硫酸铵、白垩铵等各种化肥（具体作法见图）。这些化肥都是上等的化肥，而且有就地取材，就地供应，设备简单，操作容易，成本低廉等好处。该社干部、群众编了一首赞歌：“三窑一灶办法好，全民动手把它搞；自然肥源挖不尽，废气利用资源广，就地取材就地产，多快好省突击办；集少成多堆如山，明年丰收有保障”。涌山公社利用三窑一灶废烟之初，有人认为这种办法制成的化肥作用不大；也有人认为太复杂、太麻烦，没有条件搞，说：“烟中取氨真麻烦，不如每天拾牛粪。”但是，公社党委十分重视这个问题，书记亲自挂帅，领导这一工作，在各大队抽调了一些干部和有经验的社员，边试验、边总结。试制结果，每一个砖瓦窑每天能生产一千斤左右的白垩铵或二百斤左右的碳酸氢铵、或二百斤硫酸铵液体；每一个石灰窑每天能制出六十斤左右的液体碳酸氢铵和一百斤白垩铵；每一个木炭窑能制出一千斤左右的白垩铵和五十斤左右的木炭汁水；每个锅灶烟囱每天能熏制四百斤左右的白垩铵。
    经过实验证明：凡是施用过烟中取氨制成的化肥的作物，在十天内不仅能使茎秆粗壮、叶子乌黑茂盛，而且长的比未施过化肥的作物高得多。
    现在涌山公社正大力推广从三窑一灶废烟中取氨这一先进积肥办法，力争全社二十二个石灰窑、六个砖瓦窑、七十多个木炭窑和所有能利用的锅灶都利用起来。预计全年能制造碳酸氢铵、硫酸铵、白垩铵等化肥七千六百万斤，可节约买化肥资金二万四千三百余元。“三窑一灶烟中取氨”介绍
    烧石灰、烧砖瓦、烧木炭都要用煤或柴，在煤中含有1％多的氮，还含有硫；在木柴中也有很多的氮。这些物质在燃烧过程中，被分解而产生氨、二氧化碳和二氧化硫等气体。这些气体在一定条件下能溶解于水中，起化学反应，变成碳酸氢铵和硫酸铵。因此，利用“三窑一灶，烟中取氨”的方法，既简便，又容易。概括起来烟中取氨有两种方法：一是用水吸收；二是用土块吸收。具体做法是：
    （一）石灰窑制碳酸氢铵、白垩铵，如图（一）：
    在石灰窑（1）上部砌一横烟囱（2），烟囱连通到吸收缸（3），吸收缸应连续四至五个，以保证全面吸收烟中的氨。在吸收缸内放入清水，高度不能超过烟道管（4），缸口应盖紧密封。在烧石灰时，将石灰窑口用铁盖盖住，让烟进入横烟囱再进入吸收缸。这样经过十小时左右，吸收缸内的水就吸收了许多烟中的氨和二氧化碳起化学反应，变成碳酸氢铵。然后，便可以取出施用，再在吸收缸内放清水再吸收。
    为了充分吸收烟中的氨，在烟囱出口处应砌一个熏土台（5），上面堆积湿润的土块，烟囱出口砌井字形，交错保持一定的空隙，以使所堆的全部土块都能熏烟，并能跑出一部分烟，免得妨碍烧石灰。熏制一昼夜后便可取出碾碎使用。
    （二）砖瓦窑制取碳酸氢铵和硫酸铵，如图（二）：
    在砖瓦窑烟囱（1）上砌一横烟囱（2），再砌一直烟囱（3），即吸收烟囱。让烟往上排出。吸收烟囱底部砌成斜坡，喷淋的水吸收了烟中的氨，变成碳酸氢氨或硫酸铵流入剩水桶（4）中，又将剩水桶的水循环喷入吸收烟囱六至七次，便可取来施用。
    另外，还可以用土块吸收烟中的氨制成白垩铵。
    办法是：在砖瓦窑烟囱周围堆土，中间低，周围高，或砌成长三尺、宽二点五尺的熏土斗，在烟囱口上砌一井字形，保持一定的空隙，让烟跑出，再在熏土斗中堆土熏制，约一昼夜取出碾碎则可使用。
    （三）木炭窑制白垩铵。
    在木炭窑烟囱上用砖砌成一井字形，但需注意在烟囱上面横放两块砖，防止土块落入烟囱内。其它与砖瓦窑制白垩铵相同。
    据群众经验，在烧木炭的过程中，有许多汁水渗出，每烧一窑木炭约能渗出五十至一百斤左右。经过试验，把汁水泼到草上，草在枯萎以后仍能生长起来，比其他草还长得更好。
    收汁水的方法是：将木炭窑底部打紧，周围开沟，窑边安入一竹管，使汁水流入竹管内再流入窑外的水桶中。
    （四）锅灶烟囱制白垩铵，如图（三）：
    在原烟囱（1）上再横砌一烟囱（2），通向墙外的熏土台（3）上，烟囱出口的高度应与熏土台相差不多。在烟囱出口处的熏土台上，砌一井字形砖块，并留一定的空隙让烟均匀跑出，再在上面堆土，熏制一昼夜，取出碾碎即可使用。
    总之，“三窑一灶，烟中取氨”的安装设计，应因地制宜，根据地区条件不同来设计本地区的取氨方法，不能生搬硬套，以保证更好的吸收氨，制造肥效更高、数量更多的肥料。（附图片）
