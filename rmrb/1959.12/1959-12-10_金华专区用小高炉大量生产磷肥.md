Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 7th: The Jinhua Prefecture in Zhejiang Province has successfully produced a large quantity of high-quality calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer using small blast furnaces, supporting agricultural production. Currently, there are sixteen blast furnaces in the region producing calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, with a total capacity of thirty-seven cubic meters. They were converted from some iron-smelting furnaces, and the production process is very similar to that of iron smelting with small blast furnaces. These furnaces have already produced more than nine thousand tons of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer this year, with an effective phosphorus content of between 13% and 14%. According to the trial use proof by the Jinhua Farm Experimental Station, the fertilizer effect of this chemical fertilizer is very good. When applied to rice, it can increase production by an average of 9.67%, and up to 17.95%; when applied to soybeans, the effect is even more significant, with an average increase of 52.3%.

Last June and July, the relevant leading departments of Jinhua Prefecture used the local abundant resources of phosphate ore, olivine, etc., to conduct small-scale trial production of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer in Jinhua City and Jiande County using iron melting furnaces, and organized workers to study operational experience in other places. After a period of practical production, some production rules were initially found, and by the end of the year, 378.5 tons of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer were produced, laying the foundation for comprehensive promotion. In April of this year, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Chemical Industry held an on-site meeting in this prefecture to summarize and exchange experience in producing calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer with small blast furnaces, and also exchanged operating techniques for using 1.5 cubic meter small blast furnaces. After the meeting, the prefecture organized working groups to Jiande, Shouchang and other phosphate fertilizer factories to specifically help summarize experience, held a regional on-site meeting to exchange experience in phosphate fertilizer production, and trained more than 30 technicians for Lanxi, Longyou and other counties.

In the mass movement to vigorously develop calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, Jinhua Prefecture insisted on putting politics in command, strengthening Party leadership, adhering to the "walking on two legs" policy, and firmly establishing the idea of serving agricultural production. Therefore, phosphate fertilizer production quickly developed in the entire prefecture, and the output increased day by day. From August to November this year, more than 5,500 tons of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer were produced, an increase of 35.9% compared with the total output from January to July.

    金华专区用小高炉大量生产磷肥
    据新华社杭州7日电　浙江省金华专区成功地用小高炉生产了大批优质钙镁磷肥，支援了农业生产。目前全区生产钙镁磷肥的高炉共有十六座，总容量为三十七立方米。它们是利用部分炼铁炉改建而成的，生产过程跟用小高炉炼铁的过程大同小异。这些炉子在今年已经生产出钙镁磷肥九千多吨，有效磷含量都在13％到14％之间。根据金华农场试验站试用证明，这种化肥的肥效很好。施用于水稻，平均可增产9.67％，最高可增产17.95％；施用于黄豆，效果更加显著，平均可增产52.3％。
    去年6、7月份，金华专区有关领导部门就利用本地区大量的磷矿、橄榄石等资源，在金华市和建德县用化铁炉进行小型试验生产钙镁磷肥，并组织工人到外地学习操作经验。经过一段时间的实际生产，初步找到了一些生产规律，到年底就生产了钙镁磷肥三百七十八点五吨，从而为全面推广打下了基础。今年4月份，浙江省化工厅在这个专区召开现场会议，总结交流了用小高炉生产钙镁磷肥的经验，同时交流了利用一点五立方米小高炉生产的操作技术。会后，这个专区组织工作组到建德、寿昌等磷肥厂具体帮助总结经验，召开全区性的磷肥生产经验交流现场会，并且为兰溪、龙游等县培养三十多名技术工人。
    金华专区在大搞钙镁磷肥的群众运动中，坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，坚持贯彻了“两条腿走路”的方针，牢固地树立了为农业生产服务的思想。因此，磷肥生产很快在全专区发展起来，而且产量蒸蒸日上，今年8月份到11月份，就生产了钙镁磷肥五千五百多吨，比1到7月份的总产量提高35.9％。
