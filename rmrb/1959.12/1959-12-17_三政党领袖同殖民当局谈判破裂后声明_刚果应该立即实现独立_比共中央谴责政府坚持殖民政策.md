Xinhua News Agency, December 15th, Brussels Dispatch: Abako Party Chairman Kasavubu, Congo National Movement leader Kalonji, and African Solidarity Party leader Gizenga of the Belgian Congo issued a joint statement in Brussels on the 14th, saying that after returning to the Congo, they will continue to work for the immediate independence of the Congo. Kasavubu and Kalonji already returned home by plane from Belgium that afternoon.
    These three Congolese African party leaders arrived in Brussels on December 3rd to hold a round-table conference with the Belgian government and parliament on the future of the Congo in order to realize the Congo's independence. However, the Belgian government not only refused to accept their proposal to hold a round-table conference, but also put pressure on them to nominate candidates to participate in the "local elections" arranged by the Belgian authorities.
    Kasavubu once pointed out that now is not the time to hold elections, but to immediately hold a round-table conference to enable the Congo to immediately achieve independence. Elections should then be held under the auspices of an independent Congolese government "in order to establish a genuine Congolese constituent assembly, rather than a parliament controlled by Belgium."
    Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, December 14th: The Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party passed a resolution on the 13th saying that holding negotiations on the issue of Congo's independence is the only way to resolve the cruel conflict condemned by public opinion. In fact, the government refused this method.
    The Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party held a meeting in Brussels on the 12th and 13th. The resolution was passed at the end of the meeting.
    The resolution said that Belgian Minister for Congolese Affairs De Schrijver is promoting "tolerance" in Brussels, while the Congolese administrative authorities are pursuing a policy of intimidation and anti-democratic repression.

    三政党领袖同殖民当局谈判破裂后声明
    刚果应该立即实现独立
    比共中央谴责政府坚持殖民政策
    据新华社15日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比属刚果阿巴科党主席卡萨武布、刚果民族运动党领袖卡隆吉和非洲团结党领袖基赞加14日在布鲁塞尔发表联合声明说，他们在回到刚果以后，将继续为刚果的立即独立而努力。卡萨武布和卡隆吉已经在当天下午从比利时乘飞机回国。
    这三位刚果非洲政党领袖是在12月3日到布鲁塞尔同比利时政府和议会就刚果政治前途问题举行圆桌会议来实现刚果的独立的。但是比利时政府不但拒绝接受他们提出的举行圆桌会议的建议，而且还向他们施加压力，要他们提出候选人参加由比利时当局安排的“地方选举”。
    卡萨武布曾经指出，现在不是应当举行选举，而是应当立即举行圆桌会议来使刚果立即实行独立。然后在独立的刚果政府的主持下举行选举，“以便成立一个真正的刚果制宪议会，而不是一个受比利时控制的议会”。
    据新华社布鲁塞尔14日电　比利时共产党中央委员会13日通过一项决议说，就刚果独立问题举行谈判是解决为舆论所谴责的残忍的冲突的唯一办法。而事实上政府拒绝了这个办法。
    比利时共产党中央委员会12日和13日在布鲁塞尔举行了会议。这项决议是在会议结束时通过的。
    决议说，比利时政府刚果事务大臣德舒里弗在布鲁塞尔宣扬“容忍”，而刚果的行政当局在奉行恐吓和反民主的压制政策。
