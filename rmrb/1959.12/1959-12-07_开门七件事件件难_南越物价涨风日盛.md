　　Opening the door, the seven necessities are all difficult
　　Rising inflation in South Vietnam
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi dispatch: Saigon news: According to a food price list published in the Saigon "Vietnam Times" on November 2nd, Saigon prices have been rising continuously in recent weeks. The average price of beef has risen by 8%, pork by 14%, fresh shrimp by 28%, and other items such as potatoes, cabbage, soybeans, pepper, scallions, and garlic have also been rising.
　　Reflecting the growing shortage of meat in Saigon, Ngo Dinh Diem's mouthpiece, the "National Revolution Daily," also admitted on November 5th that the supply of live pigs was insufficient. The "Freedom Daily" wrote on November 3rd that the amount of pork currently supplied to Saigon residents has been reduced by half compared to the past. At present, the charcoal shortage in Saigon has spread to various cities in South Vietnam.
　　These newspapers pointed out that the main reason for the shortage of major food and non-staple foods in South Vietnam is that the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group has recently launched "sweeps" in various parts of South Vietnam, destroying the people's normal production.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the prices of food and various consumer goods in Saigon, South Vietnam, have recently soared.
　　The prices of rice, salt, and meat have risen by more than 10%. The lack of firewood and charcoal, as well as speculation in medicines and other daily necessities, have made Saigon residents very uneasy. According to Saigon newspapers, the shortage of firewood and charcoal is a direct result of the Ngo Dinh Diem group's continued frantic suppression in the western region of South Vietnam. The western region is the main supply area for firewood and charcoal.
　　Due to the decline in purchasing power, many factories and enterprises in Saigon have had to shut down, and unemployment has become increasingly serious.

    开门七件事件件难
    南越物价涨风日盛
    新华社河内讯　西贡消息：据西贡“越南时报”11月2日刊载的食品价格表表明，最近几周内，西贡物价不断上涨，牛肉平均上涨8％，猪肉上涨14％，鲜虾上涨28％，其他像马铃薯、卷心菜、大豆、胡椒、葱和蒜头等的价格也不断上涨。
    在反映西贡肉类日益缺乏的情况时，吴庭艳的喉舌“国家革命报”11月5日也承认生猪供应不足。“自由报”11月3日写道，目前供给西贡市民的猪肉比以前减少了一半。目前，西贡炭荒现象波及南越各个城市。
    这些报纸指出，造成南越主要食品和副食品缺乏的主要原因，是由于美国—吴庭艳集团近来在南越各地展开“扫荡”，破坏了人民的正常生产。
    新华社河内讯　据越南通讯社报道，南越西贡的粮食和各种消费品的价格最近猛涨。
    大米、食盐和肉类的价格已经上涨10％以上。木柴和木炭的缺乏以及在药品和其他日用品方面的投机行为使西贡居民十分不安。据西贡报纸透露，木柴和木炭的缺乏，是由于吴庭艳集团在南越西部地区继续进行疯狂镇压的直接结果。西部地区是木柴和木炭的主要供应区。
    由于购买力的下降，西贡的很多工厂和企业不得不停工，失业情况已日益严重。
