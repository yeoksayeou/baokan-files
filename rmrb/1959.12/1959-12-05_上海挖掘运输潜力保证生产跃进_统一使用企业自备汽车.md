Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 4th: Shanghai is uniformly organizing the city's factories' and enterprises' self-owned freight vehicles to collaborate with professional transportation departments in intra-city transportation. This has greatly unleashed the potential of existing vehicles and basically meets the needs of the current continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the sharp increase in freight volume.

Shanghai's factories, enterprises, government offices, and other units have more than 3,800 freight vehicles, accounting for 63% of the city's freight vehicles, but their utilization rate is only about 20% of that of professional transportation vehicles. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the call to oppose right-leaning tendencies and encourage vigor, a new production upsurge emerged on the industrial and agricultural fronts, requiring more materials to be transported. Therefore, vigorously tapping the transportation potential of self-owned vehicles has become an important task to support production. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a special meeting in September and decided to uniformly organize this part of the scattered transportation force and centrally dispatch it. As of now, apart from a portion of self-owned vehicles needed for special purposes such as fire protection, cleaning, and filmmaking, as well as those used within factories for production processes and temporary rush transport, more than 2,100 vehicles have been organized and concentrated, accounting for about 90% of the vehicles that can be organized.

In view of the characteristics of self-owned freight vehicles, such as their large number, wide distribution, and complex types, Shanghai has adopted two forms in its organization work. The first is that nine bureaus with larger freight volumes, such as metallurgy, electrical machinery, machinery, chemical industry, light industry, construction engineering, foreign trade, and the first and second commercial bureaus, have concentrated the freight vehicles of their key factories and enterprises into teams, linked them with professional vehicle yards that transport similar materials, established joint dispatch stations, and comprehensively arranged their business. The second is that the self-owned vehicles of small and medium-sized factories and enterprises affiliated to these nine bureaus and other systems are organized by the districts where they are located, according to the source of goods and vehicle conditions, into motorcades, contracted to transport the consigned goods in this area. They are also linked with the business offices of professional transportation units located in the district—implementing unified contracting of business, unified freight rates, and unified management.

Shanghai has grasped the following principles in organizing self-owned vehicles: After the vehicles are organized, the ownership belongs to the original factory or enterprise, and the drivers, loaders, and managers transferred with the vehicles still belong to the original unit. Their wages and benefits remain unchanged according to the original unit's standards. Each motorcade has priority in transporting the materials of its own unit, without disrupting the original production order. At the same time, after the vehicles are organized, cost accounting is carried out by motorcade, and each vehicle is recorded, with the surplus and depreciation handed over to the original unit. On the other hand, due to the increased frequency of vehicle operation, parts are easily worn, and relevant units have strengthened the maintenance of vehicles. Therefore, despite the increase in vehicle mileage, the rate of intact vehicles has actually increased. Due to the correct implementation of these principles, all factories and enterprises actively support the method of uniformly organizing self-owned vehicles.

It has only been more than two months since the self-owned vehicles of factories and enterprises were organized, but this practice has already shown great advantages. According to statistics, the vehicle-ton-day output (the amount of transportation per day per ton of load of each vehicle) of these more than 2,000 vehicles has increased from 3.65 tons in the past to 6.19 tons, and the transportation efficiency has increased by about 70%, which can transport 27,600 tons of goods more per day, equivalent to adding 293 Liberation brand vehicles with a load of four tons.

Due to the unified arrangement of business and the rational use of vehicles, it has been initially possible to achieve full load and multiple shipments. This is the first effect shown after the organization. After the organization, it is convenient to arrange vehicles according to the size of the freight volume, using large vehicles for large quantities of goods and small vehicles for small quantities of goods. The scattered materials of nearby factories and enterprises can also be consolidated, giving full play to the transportation potential.

Secondly, each motorcade rationally dispatches vehicles according to the flow of materials, reducing the mileage of empty vehicles. A light bulb factory in Hongkou District used two vehicles with a load of 750 kilograms each to transport more than ten tons of light bulbs to the station every day and then return empty to the factory. It ran continuously from morning to night but still could not complete the task. A food factory in this district used to send a large truck with a load of six tons to the station every day to transport back non-staple foods such as pork and fruits, and even more trucks were sent when there were more goods. Now, the motorcade uses large trucks to load light bulbs and transport back non-staple foods, usually making four or five round trips a day to meet the needs of both parties. The two vehicles of the light bulb factory have also been freed up to support the transportation of other factories.

Drivers, loaders, and other workers scattered in various units have established Party organizations and strengthened political and ideological work after being concentrated into teams. The workers have launched labor competitions, learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced, and their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high. After the self-owned vehicles are organized, the workers can better carry out technical innovation through experience exchange.

After the transportation potential of self-owned freight vehicles is brought into play, the principle of "guaranteeing key points and taking care of general needs" is more effectively implemented. Now, most of the transportation tasks of Shanghai's small and medium-sized enterprises in terms of production needs and market supply are undertaken by organized self-owned vehicles, so professional transportation units can concentrate more efforts on the transportation of materials for large factories, key basic construction projects, and trunk lines of stations and ports. The Fifth Motor Transport Yard has converted the 50 vehicles that transported non-staple foods and daily necessities to transport important chemical raw materials.

    上海挖掘运输潜力保证生产跃进
    统一使用企业自备汽车
    据新华社上海4日电　上海市统一组织全市工厂、企业的自备货运汽车，同专业运输部门分工协作，参加市内运输，使得现有车辆的潜力大大发挥，基本上满足了当前工农业生产继续跃进、运量猛增的需要。
    上海各工厂、企业、机关等单位共有货运汽车三千八百多辆，占全市货运车辆的63％，但是使用效率只相当于专业运输车辆的20％左右。党的八届八中全会发出反右倾、鼓干劲的号召以后，工农业战线上出现了新的生产高潮，需要运输的物资更多。因此，大力挖掘自备车辆的运输潜力，就成为支援生产的一项重要任务。中共上海市委在9月份专门召开会议，决定把这部分分散的运输力量统一组织起来，集中调度。到目前为止，自备车辆中除了消防、清洁、拍电影等特种用途，以及工厂内部各生产工序间使用和临时性突击运输需要的一部分以外，已经组织集中的有二千一百多辆，占可以组织的车辆90％左右。
    针对自备货运汽车数量多、分布广、车种复杂的特点，上海在组织工作上采取了两种形式。第一种，运量较大的冶金、电机、机械、化工、轻工、建筑工程、对外贸易、第一和第二商业等九个局，将所属重点工厂企业的货运汽车集中编队，分别跟运输同类物资的专业车场对口挂钩，设立联合调度站，全面安排业务。第二种，这九个局所属的中小型工厂企业和其它各系统的自备汽车，由所在的区根据货源和车辆情况，按地段编组车队，包干承运这个地段的托运物资。他们又同专业运输单位设在本区的营业所挂钩——实行统一承揽业务，统一运价和统一管理。
    上海市在组织自备汽车的过程中，掌握了这样几个原则：车辆组织起来以后，产权属于原来的工厂企业，随车调出的司机、装卸工人和管理人员，仍然属原单位编制。他们的工资和福利待遇，也按原单位标准不变。各车队优先承运出车单位的物资，不打乱原来的生产秩序。同时，车辆组织起来以后，还以车队为单位进行成本核算，每辆车都记账，盈余和折旧交给原单位。另一方面，由于车辆运行次数增加，机件容易磨损，有关单位加强了车辆的保修工作。因此，尽管车辆行驶里程增加，完好率反而提高。由于这些原则的正确贯彻，各工厂企业都积极拥护统一组织自备汽车的办法。
    工厂企业的自备汽车组织起来才两个多月，已经显示出这种做法的很大优越性。据统计，这两千多辆汽车的车吨日产量（每辆汽车每个载重吨位的一天运输量）从过去的三点六五吨提高到六点一九吨，运输效率提高70％左右，每天可以多运两万七千六百吨货物，相当于增加载重四吨的解放牌汽车二百九十三辆。
    由于统筹安排业务、合理使用车辆，已经初步做到满载多运。这是组织起来以后表现的第一个效果。组织起来以后，便于根据运量大小安排车辆，货多用大车，货少用小车，就近工厂企业的零星物资还能实行拼装，充分发挥了运输潜力。
    其次，各车队根据物资的流向，合理调度车辆，减少了汽车空驶的里程。虹口区一家灯泡厂每天用两辆载重七百五十公斤的汽车，把十多吨灯泡运往车站又空驶回厂，从早到晚连续奔跑还不能完成任务。这个区一家食品厂每天派一辆载重六吨的大卡车，到车站运回猪肉、水果等副食品，货多时还派得更多；现在，车队利用大卡车装去灯泡，运回副食品，通常每天来回四五次就满足了双方的需要，灯泡厂的两辆汽车也因此腾出来支援了其他工厂的运输。
    分散在各单位的司机、装卸工人等集中编队后，普遍建立了党的组织，加强了政治思想工作。工人们纷纷展开劳动竞赛，学先进，赶先进，生产热情空前高涨。自备汽车组织起来以后，工人们能更好地通过经验交流，大闹技术革新。
    自备货运汽车运输潜力发挥以后，更有效地贯彻了“保证重点，照顾一般”的原则。现在，上海各中小企业生产需要和市场供应这两方面的运输任务，大部分已由组织起来的自备汽车担负，专业运输单位因此能够集中更多力量从事大型工厂、重点基本建设工程和车站、港口干线的物资运输。汽车运输第五场已经把运副食品、日用品的五十辆汽车，改运重要的化工原料。
