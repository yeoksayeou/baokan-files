Under the brutal rule of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, South Vietnam's fisheries are also declining daily, and fishermen are living in misery.

Fisheries, one of the main sources of income for the people of South Vietnam, are controlled by American capitalists. In recent years, the United States, through Ngo Dinh Diem's group, has established eighty so-called "fishery cooperatives," seizing the main fish-producing areas of South Vietnam. At the same time, it has monopolized the export rights of South Vietnamese seafood, buying seafood at low prices and refusing to buy "inferior fish." Fishermen cannot sell their fish and have to use them as fertilizer, which has caused their living standards to decline sharply. The U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem authorities also exploit fishermen by lending money at usurious interest rates through the so-called "National Agricultural Credit Bureau." Fishermen are forced to abandon the fisheries passed down from their ancestors and find other ways out. Therefore, South Vietnam's fisheries are not only not developing, but are declining daily. According to the "Tropical and Mediterranean Markets" publication on September 5 this year, South Vietnam's total fishery output in 1958 was only 143,000 tons, 12,743 tons less than North Vietnam in the same year. Fishery income has also declined significantly, from 7.5 billion yuan (South Vietnamese currency) in 1954 to 4.16 billion yuan in 1955. Between 1957 and 1958, fishery income further declined to 1.5711 billion yuan.

Regarding this situation, even Ngo Dinh Diem's "National Revolution Daily" had to admit that "the debts of Southern fishermen are too large to be repaid." Saigon's "Chung Sheng Bao" also acknowledged that some South Vietnamese fishermen "do not even have clothes to cover their bodies" or "live a wandering and painful life all year round."

### 南越渔业生产日益下降  渔民负债累累　生活十分悲惨

    南越渔业生产日益下降
    渔民负债累累　生活十分悲惨
    在美国和吴庭艳集团的残暴统治下，南越的渔业也日益衰退，渔民生活痛苦不堪。
    越南南方人民经济收入的主要来源之一——渔业，掌握在美国资本家的手里。几年来，美国通过吴庭艳集团的名义，成立了八十个所谓“渔业合作社”，强占了南越主要的产鱼区，同时还垄断了越南南方海产出口权，低价购买海产，又拒绝购买“次等鱼”，渔民的鱼卖不出去，只好当肥料用，使渔民生活水平急剧下降。美国—吴庭艳当局还通过所谓“国家农信局”放高利贷剥削渔民，渔民只好被迫放弃祖祖辈辈传下来的渔业而另找出路。因此，南越渔业不但得不到发展，反而日益下降。据“热带和地中海市场”刊物今年9月5日报道，1958年南越渔业总产量只有十四万三千吨，比越南北方同年少一万二千七百四十三吨。渔业收入也显著下降，1954年渔业收入达七十五亿元（南越币），1955年下降至四十一亿六千元；1957年—1958年间，渔业收入更下降到十五亿七千一百万元。
    对于这种情况，连吴庭艳的“国家革命报”也不得不承认，“南方渔民债务之多是无法偿清的”。西贡“钟声报”也承认，南越渔民“有些人连蔽身的衣服也没有”或“终年过着漂荡痛苦的生活”。
