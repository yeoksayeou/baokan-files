The Despicable Face of Historical Fabricators
By a commentator from this newspaper

    December 19th is the anniversary of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the French. Thirteen years ago today, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people rose up to defend the great achievements of the August Revolution—the nascent Democratic Republic of Vietnam—and resist the barbaric aggression of the French colonial army. The entire heroic history of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the French proves that an awakened and well-led small nation is capable of defeating seemingly powerful colonialists. In the eight-year history of the war of resistance against the French, the Vietnamese people used blood to write down the honor and pride of the Vietnamese nation.

    However, now the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam dares to openly attempt to fabricate history and steal the great achievements of the Vietnamese people in the national liberation war; at the same time, they are trying to prettify themselves and pose as ridiculous so-called "national heroes." The so-called "Republic of Vietnam's Policy towards Former Resistance Personnel," published by the Saigon "National Revolution Daily" from August 25th to September 2nd this year, is a complete exposure of this despicable attempt. This document makes a thorough distortion and fabrication of the history of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the French, and the most shameless desecration of the national dignity of all the Vietnamese people.

    The historical fabricators in South Vietnam attempt to deny the leading role of the Vietnamese Labor Party (formerly the Vietnamese Communist Party and the Indochinese Communist Party) in the Vietnamese national liberation war, and even shamelessly slander that "the Viet Cong did not participate in the war of resistance," but instead "undermined and betrayed the war of resistance." The Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam believes that lies written in ink can cover up facts written in blood. However, anyone who knows a little about the history of the Vietnamese national liberation movement knows that since the French colonialists invaded Vietnamese territory, the Vietnamese people have heroically fought against the French colonialists, one after another. Although they constantly achieved many victories in their struggles, they were unable to drive the French colonialists out of Vietnam. Only in 1930, after the establishment of the Vietnamese Communist Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh, did the Vietnamese national liberation movement enter a new stage. Under the leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people waged arduous struggles against the French colonialists and Japanese fascist bandits, and finally launched the glorious August Revolution in August 1945, establishing the independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In 1946, when French imperialism attempted to stage a comeback and reoccupy the sacred territory of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of their great leader and the Communist Party, launched a nationwide war of resistance. After eight years of war, the Vietnamese people's armed forces developed from a guerrilla team of only thirty-four people and a dozen guns into a people's army with hundreds of thousands of people and modern weapons, liberating most of Vietnam from the French colonialists, giving the French aggressors a fatal blow; and the victory of the Dien Bien Phu battle in 1954 finally forced the French colonialists to sign the Geneva armistice agreement and recognize the independent rights of the Vietnamese people. Today, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the people of North Vietnam are working to build a prosperous and happy socialist country and are continuing to strive for the unification and complete independence of their motherland. The Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh enjoy supreme prestige in the hearts of all the Vietnamese people, which cannot be destroyed by any lies or bayonets of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

    It is very clear that the reason why the Ngo Dinh Diem clique wants to publish a document fabricating history at this time is to follow the will of its American masters and further undermine the Geneva Accords, creating an excuse for it to carry out a larger-scale bloody persecution of former resistance personnel residing in South Vietnam. As everyone knows, the provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning Vietnam stipulate that there shall be no retaliation or discrimination against former resistance personnel and their families and related groups, and that their democratic freedoms shall be guaranteed. However, this document of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique openly stipulates, in the name of "distinguishing former resistance elements from Viet Cong sabotage groups," that "all members, cadres, and leading cadres of the Indochinese Communist Party and the Vietnamese Labor Party (i.e., the Viet Cong) cannot be regarded as former resistance personnel," and that all people who are loyal to the cause of national independence and demand the implementation of the Geneva Accords, "regardless of whether they are Communist Party members," also "cannot be regarded as former resistance personnel." Then, who are the remaining so-called "former resistance personnel"? According to the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's distortion of the truth, they are of course the dregs of Vietnamese society who betrayed national interests, recognized the enemy as their father, and opposed communism and the people during the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the French. After reversing the truth of "former resistance personnel," the Ngo Dinh Diem clique further clamored fiercely in the document that they would "establish special military tribunals" and "severely punish Viet Cong saboteurs" based on Ngo Dinh Diem's so-called "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959." In fact, since the signing of the Geneva Accords, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, under the instructions of the United States, has consistently disregarded the Geneva Accords and carried out bloody persecution of former resistance personnel and patriotic people in South Vietnam who still reside in the South. According to incomplete statistics, 200,000 patriotic people in South Vietnam have been imprisoned, tortured, and killed in these years. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique has also dispatched a large number of troops to carry out bloody "sweeps" against the patriotic people of South Vietnam. Now the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has published this document obliterating the truth of Vietnamese history, which is a vicious signal that the South Vietnamese authorities will further suppress patriotic people and massacre former resistance personnel. All those who are concerned about the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam and concerned about the cause of peaceful reunification of Vietnam should pay serious attention to this sinister intention of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam.

    The historical fabricators in South Vietnam want to dress up the Ngo Dinh Diem clique as "national heroes" of Vietnam, which is simply a matter of not knowing shame. Everyone knows that when the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party, were resisting French colonial rule and Japanese fascist rule, Ngo Dinh Diem, this self-proclaimed "national hero," was precisely a traitor to the Vietnamese nation. In history, Ngo Dinh Diem has always been a servant of the French colonialists. After the Japanese fascists invaded Indochina in 1940, Ngo Dinh Diem immediately went over to the Japanese occupiers. The year after the Vietnamese August Revolution broke out, Ngo Dinh Diem once again became a pawn of Morlière, the then commander-in-chief of the French army in Indochina. After the all-out war of resistance in Vietnam began in December 1946, the French colonialists transferred Ngo Dinh Diem to Saigon to serve his French masters. After 1950, seeing that French colonial rule was on the verge of collapse under the blows of the people, Ngo Dinh Diem transformed himself and threw himself into the arms of American imperialism. After the restoration of peace in Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique obediently acted according to the instructions of American imperialism, wantonly sabotaged the Geneva Accords, obstructed the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and gradually turned South Vietnam into a de facto military base and colony of the United States. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique is a complete lackey of American imperialism, a shameful traitor and betrayer of the cause of Vietnamese national independence. This is the true despicable face of the historical fabricators in South Vietnam.

    历史伪造者的卑污面目
    本报评论员
    12月19日是越南人民抗法战争的纪念
  日。十三年前的今天，越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，奋起捍卫八月革命的伟大成果——新生的越南民主共和国，抗击法国殖民军的野蛮侵略。越南人民抗法战争的全部英勇历史，证明一个觉醒了的具有成熟领导的弱小民族，是能够战胜那些貌似强大的殖民主义者的。越南人民在八年抗法战争的历史上，用鲜血写下了越南民族的荣誉和骄傲。
    但是，现在南越吴庭艳集团竟敢在光天化日之下，企图伪造历史，窃取越南人民在民族解放战争中的伟大功绩；同时替自己涂脂抹粉，装扮成可笑的所谓“民族英雄”。今年8月25日至9月2日，西贡“国家革命报”发表的所谓“越南共和国对前抗战人员的政策”的文件，就是这种卑鄙企图的大暴露。这个文件对越南人民抗法战争的历史，作了彻头彻尾的歪曲和捏造，对于越南全体人民的民族尊严作了最无耻的亵渎。
    南越的历史伪造者企图否定越南劳动党（它的前身是越南共产党和印度支那共产党）在越南民族解放战争中的领导作用，甚至厚颜无耻地诬蔑“越共没有抗过战”，而是“破坏与背叛了抗战”。南越吴庭艳集团以为，墨写的谎言可以掩盖血写的事实。但是，只要稍为了解越南民族解放运动历史的人都知道，自从法国殖民者侵入越南国土的时候起，越南人民就曾前仆后继地对法国殖民者进行着英勇的斗争。他们在斗争中虽然不断取得许多胜利，但并没有能把法国殖民者驱逐出越南。只有到了1930年，越南成立了以胡志明主席为首的越南共产党以后，越南的民族解放运动才进入了一个新的阶段。在越南共产党和胡志明主席的领导下，越南人民进行了反抗法国殖民者和日本法西斯强盗的艰苦斗争，而最后在1945年8月发动了光辉的八月革命，建立了独立的越南民主共和国。1946年法国帝国主义者企图卷土重来，重新侵占越南神圣的国土，越南人民在自己的伟大领袖和共产党的领导下展开了全民的抗战。经过八年抗战以后，越南人民武装力量由一支只有三十四人、十几支枪的游击队，发展成为一支拥有数十万人和现代化武器装备的人民军队，从法国殖民者手里解放了越南大部国土，给予法国侵略者以致命的打击；而1954年奠边府战役的胜利，终于迫使法国殖民者在日内瓦停战协议上签字，并且承认了越南人民的独立权利。今天，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，越南北部的人民正在为建设一个富强康乐的社会主义国家，正在继续为祖国的统一和完全独立而奋斗。越南劳动党和胡志明主席在全体越南人民心中享有至高无上的威望，这是吴庭艳集团用任何谎言或者刺刀都不能够摧毁的。
    事情很明白，吴庭艳集团之所以要在这个时候发表伪造历史的文件，是为了遵照其美国主子的意志，进一步破坏日内瓦协议，为它对居住在南越的前抗战人员进行更大规模的血腥迫害制造借口。大家知道，有关越南的日内瓦协议的条款规定，不得报复和歧视前抗战人员及其家属和有关团体，并且保证他们的民主自由权利。而吴庭艳集团的这个文件公然在“区别前抗战分子与越共破坏集团”的名义下，规定“印支共党及越南劳动党（即越共）的全部党员、干部，首脑干部都不能算是前抗战人员”，一切忠于祖国独立事业和要求贯彻日内瓦协议的人民，“不论是否共产党员”，也都“不能算是前抗战人员”。那末，剩下来的所谓的“前抗战人员”是些什么人呢？按照吴庭艳集团颠倒黑白的说法，当然是那些在越南人民抗法战争期间出卖民族利益，认贼作父，反共反人民的越南社会的渣滓了。在颠倒了“前抗战人员”的真伪以后，吴庭艳集团在文件中进一步穷凶极恶地叫嚷将根据吴庭艳的所谓“59年第十号法令，设立特别军事法庭”，“严惩越共破坏分子”。事实上，自从日内瓦协议签订以来，吴庭艳集团在美国的指使下，一直无视日内瓦协议，对仍然居住在南方的越南前抗战人员和南越的爱国人民进行了血腥的迫害。据不完全统计，已有二十万南越的爱国人士在这几年里遭到囚禁、酷刑和杀害。吴庭艳集团还出动众多的军队对南越的爱国人民实行血腥的“扫荡”。现在吴庭艳集团发表这个抹煞越南历史真相的文件，是南越当局进一步镇压爱国人民和屠杀前抗战人员的一个凶恶的信号。一切关心日内瓦协议在越南实施和关心越南和平统一事业的人们，对南越吴庭艳集团这个险恶的用心，都应该严重注意。
    南越的历史伪造者想把吴庭艳集团打扮成越南的“民族英雄”，这简直是不知人间尚有羞耻事。谁都知道，正当越南人民在越南共产党领导下反抗法国殖民统治和日本法西斯统治的年月里，吴庭艳这个自封的“民族英雄”正是越南民族的叛徒。在历史上，吴庭艳一直都是法国殖民者的仆从，1940年日本法西斯侵入印度支那后，吴庭艳又立刻投靠了日本占领者。当越南八月革命爆发后的第二年，吴庭艳又重新成为当时印度支那的法军总司令莫利埃的走卒。1946年12月越南全面抗战开始后，法国殖民者把吴庭艳调往西贡，为其法国主子效劳。1950年以后，吴庭艳眼见法国殖民统治已在人民的打击下摇摇欲坠了，他就摇身一变，投入了美国帝国主义的怀抱。在越南和平恢复以后，吴庭艳集团驯服地按照美国帝国主义的指令办事，肆意破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的和平统一，逐步地把南越变成了美国事实上的军事基地和殖民地。吴庭艳集团是美国帝国主义的十足的走狗，越南民族独立事业的可耻的奸细和叛卖者。这就是南越历史伪造者的真正的卑污面目。
