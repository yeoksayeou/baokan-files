Xinhua News Agency, 11th—In the large-scale water conservancy efforts, the people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing resolutely implemented the policy of diligent and thrifty water management, saving considerable funds and materials.

    Self-raising funds and materials, and trying not to ask the state for anything, is a characteristic of this winter's water conservancy construction in the suburbs. The Suncun Brigade of the Huangcun Commune plans to excavate more than 715,000 meters of various channels and build 18 main canal sluice gates this year. Initially, some cadres of the brigade were daunted, believing that it would be difficult to complete such a large water conservancy construction task without relying on state funds and materials. The brigade party committee held a cadre meeting, criticizing this passive waiting mentality, and put forward the slogan "Do your own thing, don't cry to the state for difficulties." They adopted the method of self-reliance and using local materials. They have now prepared 100,000 bricks, solving the material needs for building the gates. The Wangjiayuan Reservoir in Changping District was completely built by the Nankou People's Commune mainly through self-raised funds. In order to solve the problem of insufficient tools, they organized young people to beat brambles, weave baskets, cut pickaxe handles, and carry stretchers, meeting the needs of construction.

    Extensive use of substitutes, replacing the new with the old, and wood for iron, is another characteristic of this winter's water conservancy construction in the suburbs. During the construction of the river-blocking sluice gate in Daxing District, the design required more than 1,900 tons of cement. In order to save cement for the state, they criticized the idea that "substitutes cannot be used for sluice gate construction." For concrete projects with lighter loads, they adopted the method of mortar-laid and poured rubble, which not only saved cement, but also resulted in good project quality. The Changping District Youth Reservoir construction site sent people to the mountains to beat brambles and weave them into bundles to replace the wood used to build work sheds, then plastered them with yellow mud, which not only saved 15,000 yuan in expenses, but was also very warm.

    In the diligent and thrifty water management, the people's communes promoted the spirit of mutual exchange and cooperation, greatly saving expenses. When the Nanyuan People's Commune was building an artificial lake, thanks to the support of nearby communes such as Huaifang and Dahongmen Brigades, it quickly installed a complete set of electrical equipment with little expense.

    The Sheyanggang Reservoir in Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, used local materials to erect a sky bridge 136 meters long and 14 meters high, reducing the earth transportation distance by 200 meters and increasing work efficiency by eleven times.

    北京郊区勤俭治水
    新华社11日讯　北京郊区各人民公社在大兴水利中，坚决贯彻执行勤俭办水利的方针，节省了不少资金和材料。
    自筹资金物料，尽量不伸手向国家要东西，是郊区今冬水利建设的一个特点。黄村公社孙村大队今年要开挖各种渠道七十一万五千多米，建干渠大闸十八座。开始时大队某些干部有畏难情绪，认为不依靠国家的资金和物料，很难完成这么大的水利建设任务。大队党委召开干部会，批判了这种消极等待思想，提出“自己事情自己办，不向国家喊困难”的口号。他们采取自力更生、就地取材的方法，现在已经准备好十万块砖，解决了建闸所需要的材料。昌平区王家园水库完全是南口人民公社用自筹为主的方法修建起来的。他们为了解决工具不足的困难，组织青壮年打荆条、编筐、砍镐把和抬扛，满足了施工的需要。
    广泛使用代用品，以旧代新、以木代铁，是郊区今冬水利建设的另一个特点。大兴区在建筑拦河闸的工程中，按照设计需要水泥一千九百多吨，他们为了给国家节省水泥，批判了“建闸工程不可能用代用品”的说法，对受力较轻的混凝土工程，采取了浆砌浇筑块石的办法，不但节省了水泥，而且工程质量良好。昌平区青年水库工地派人上山打荆条，编成荆把代替搭工棚用的木材，然后用黄泥抹好，不仅节省了一万五千元的开支，而且还很保暖。
    各人民公社在勤俭办水利中，发扬了互通有无的协作精神，大大节约了开支。南苑人民公社在建造人工湖时，由于得到附近公社槐房、大红门等大队的支援，花钱不多，就迅速安装了全套电力设备。（附图片）
    浙江龙游县社阳港水库就地取材，架起一座长一百三十六米、高十四米的天桥，运土距离缩短二百米，提高工效十一倍。
