From newspapers, I read about the model deeds of some outstanding pig farmers, and I was deeply moved.

In the Lianqun Livestock Farm of Toutuo Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, there are ten outstanding pig-raising girls. Each of them raises an average of fifteen sows, twenty-five piglets, and ten meat pigs, and all the pigs, large and small, are fat and healthy. In the feeding process, they don't mind getting dirty or tired. When a pig gets sick, they are so "worried that they lose their appetite and can't sleep well." They are not only good at raising pigs but also have learned a set of techniques such as mating and epidemic prevention.

There is also the story of the "Three Golden Lotus" raising pigs. The "Three Golden Lotus" refers to Hu Jinlian, Xu Jinlian, and Li Jinlian. All three of them are thirty-six years old this year and are feeders in the Guangji Production Team of Lihui Commune in Shanghai County. People praise the "Three Golden Lotus" not because they have the same name and the same age, but because they all love the pig-raising business. The survival rate of the pigs raised by the "Three Golden Lotus" reached 99%, every sow is pregnant, and the meat pigs grow fat and fast. Some people say, "Being a feeder means dealing with pigs, which is dirty, smelly, and has no future." The "Three Golden Lotus" said, "Raising pigs accumulates fertilizer to nourish the fields, and it can also support the cities." They are not afraid of getting dirty or smelly. Whenever a sow gives birth to piglets, they sleep in the pigsty to take care of them. The "Three Golden Lotus" have a total of sixteen children who need to be taken care of, but they have overcome various difficulties and concentrate on raising the pigs well.

The most fundamental reason why they love the pig-raising business so much is that they have integrated the pig-raising work with the revolutionary cause as a whole. They have demonstrated a high sense of responsibility towards the revolutionary cause in the matter of raising pigs.

Raising pigs, raising chickens, raising ducks..., these all seem to be "trivial" matters, insignificant. But in the eyes of revolutionaries, all issues related to the lives of the masses are major events in the world. Our people often use the phrase "bumper harvest of grains, prosperity of livestock" to describe a well-fed and clothed prosperous life. It can be seen how important "grains" and "livestock" occupy in people's lives. To change the "poor and blank" face of our national economy, we must promote both industry and agriculture. In agriculture, we must not only achieve a "bumper harvest of grains," but also "prosperity of livestock." In fact, we are not only trying to make "livestock" prosper, but also "eight kinds of livestock" prosper, "ten kinds of livestock" prosper, and make all livestock useful to the people flourish greatly. If livestock prospers, the things contributed to the people will also increase, isn't this exactly what the revolutionary cause needs? Outstanding feeders such as the "Ten Girls" and the "Three Golden Lotus" have seen the actual needs of the revolution, recognized the contribution of pig-raising work to the revolutionary cause, so they do not regard pig-raising as suffering, but as happiness; they do not regard pig-raising as shame, but as honor. They are indomitable in the face of difficulties, and they try their best to raise more and better pigs, determined to achieve "prosperity of livestock." This ambition is a revolutionary ambition!

In our construction undertaking, there are many arduous and complex tasks; dealing with pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits, etc. is also not an easy task. It is impossible to do this work well without unlimited love for the revolutionary cause. Is raising pigs dirty? Of course, it's dirty. Does it smell bad? Of course, it smells bad. However, because the "Ten Girls" and the "Three Golden Lotus" infused lofty revolutionary enthusiasm into their feeding work, they didn't think about dirt or stench, but how to raise more pigs for the country; they didn't consider personal comfort, but how to create happiness for the collective. Naturally, they inevitably get dirty and smelly in their feeding work, but their thoughts are very pure and fragrant. In front of these selfless and public-spirited feeders, what reason do people have not to respect their labor or to be unwilling to engage in this noble labor?

All labor that is beneficial to the revolution is glorious. Only in the old society was there a so-called distinction between "noble" and "lowly." Those exploiters, despised labor, and lived off the exploitation of other people's labor; they abhorred the dirt and stench of raising pigs, but they haggled over every ounce when eating pork. They thought they were clean and self-respecting, but they were the dirtiest and smelliest.

The outstanding feeders have given us an inspiration: All labor that is beneficial to the people is an indispensable force in the revolution.

    养猪和革命
    单久山
    从报纸上读到了一些优秀饲养员的模范事迹，深受感动。
    浙江黄岩县头陀公社联群畜牧场，有十个出色的养猪姑娘，她们每人平均饲养十五头母猪、二十五头小猪和十头肉猪，大猪小猪个个肥健。在饲养过程中，她们不嫌脏不嫌累。猪一害病，她们就“担心得吃饭无味，睡觉不安”。她们不仅善于饲养，还学会了配种、防疫等一套技术。
    还有一个“三金莲”养猪的故事。“三金莲”指的是胡金莲、许金莲、李金莲，她们三人今年都是三十六岁，都是上海县鲁汇公社光继生产队的饲养员。人们称颂“三金莲”并不是因为她们名字相同、年龄相同，而是因为她们都热爱养猪事业。“三金莲”养的猪成活率达到99％，母猪头头满怀，肉猪长得又肥又快。有人说：“做饲养员与猪打交道，又脏又臭没出息。”“三金莲”却说：“养猪积肥可养田，又可以支援城市。”她们不怕脏不怕臭，每当母猪生小猪，就睡在猪棚里看护。“三金莲”共有十六个孩子，都需要照顾，可是她们却克服了种种困难，专心一意把猪饲养好。
    她们如此酷爱养猪事业，最根本的原因，就是她们把养猪工作和革命事业联成了一个整体，她们在养猪的问题上表现了对待革命事业的崇高的负责精神。
    养猪、养鸡、养鸭……，似乎都是些“鸡毛”小事，微不足道。可是在革命者看来，一切关系到群众生活的问题，都是天下大事。我国人民常常用“五谷丰登，六畜兴旺”的话来形容丰衣足食的富裕生活。可见，“五谷”和“六畜”在人民生活中占着何等重要的地位。我们要改变我国国民经济“一穷二白”的面貌，就要工农业并举，而在农业中，不仅要使“五谷丰登”，也要使得“六畜兴旺”起来。其实，我们何止是要使“六畜”兴旺呢？简直要使“八畜”兴旺，
  “十畜”兴旺，使一切对人民有用的牲畜都要大兴旺。牲畜兴旺了，贡献给人民的东西也就多了，这不正是革命事业所需要的吗。“十姑娘”、“三金莲”等优秀的饲养员，正是看到了革命的实际需要，认清了养猪工作对革命事业的贡献，所以她们不以养猪为苦，而以养猪为乐；不以养猪为耻，而以养猪为荣。她们在困难面前百折不挠，千方百计地要把猪养得多，养得好，立志做到“六畜兴旺”。这种志气，是一种革命的志气！
    在我们的建设事业中，有着很多艰巨、复杂的工作；和猪牛羊鸡鸭兔等打交道，同样不是一件容易的事情，没有对于革命事业的无限热爱，是不可能做好这件工作的。养猪脏不脏呢？当然脏；臭不臭呢？当然臭。可是，由于“十姑娘”和“三金莲”把崇高的革命热情灌注到饲养工作中去了，她们想到的不是脏，不是臭，而是怎样为国家多养几头猪；她们考虑的不是个人生活舒适，而是怎样为集体创造幸福。自然，她们在饲养工作中有时免不了会弄得一身脏臭，然而她们的思想却十分纯洁，芳香四溢。在这些舍己为人、为公忘私的饲养员面前，人们有什么理由不尊重她们的劳动，或者不愿意从事这种高尚的劳动呢？
    一切对于革命有益的劳动都是光荣的。只有在旧社会，才有所谓“高贵”、“低贱”之分。那些剥削者们，轻视劳动，靠剥削别人的劳动养活自己；厌恶养猪的脏臭，吃起猪肉来却斤斤较量。他们自以为洁身自好，可是最脏最臭的也正是他们。
    优秀的饲养员们给了我们一个启发：凡是对人民有益的劳动都是革命不可缺少的一份力量。
