After Hubei Province, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, promoted the experience of Gao Huatang, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Construction Management District of Dayan Commune in Yun County, in leading the masses to manage water, mountains, and soil, and the experience of Zaoyang County in transforming hills, a mass movement to manage water, mountains, and soil quickly unfolded. Now, hundreds and thousands of barren mountains have been turned into fertile fields, and water conservancy projects are blooming everywhere, rapidly changing the natural appearance of many areas that were once called backward. Today, our newspaper publishes this news and a corresponding article, which is an important experience worthy of universal attention. Yun County and Zaoyang County in Hubei Province are located in mountainous areas with thin soil and abundant rocks. Before liberation, the average grain yield per mu was only a few dozen jin, and people lived in poverty. After liberation, the Yun County Party Committee and the Zaoyang County Party Committee tried many ways to change this backward situation, carried out some agricultural capital construction, such as building water conservancy projects and reclaiming wasteland, and achieved certain results, initially improving people's lives. However, due to the small scale and weak strength of mutual aid groups and primary cooperatives, they could only treat the symptoms but not the root causes, and the level of production was still relatively low. After the advanced cooperatives, especially the people's communes, the situation fundamentally changed. The experience of the Party organization and General Branch Secretary Gao Huatang of the Construction Management District of Dayan Commune in leading the masses to transform mountainous areas was formed under such historical conditions. This involves combining water management, mountain management, and soil management, making unified plans, with water management as the center, and water management focusing on water storage, and vigorously developing gravity irrigation. Under the unified leadership and overall planning of the people's commune, comprehensive management is carried out according to water systems and mountains. At the same time, work is combined with terracing slopes, planting trees, and other soil and mountain management tasks. This is agricultural capital construction and the foundation for doing a good job in agricultural production. This can not only prevent mountain floods from washing away the land, but also provide gravity irrigation, develop diversified operations, and save a large amount of labor. This ensures that mountainous areas are free from drought and flood, and their appearance is changed accordingly. This is a great victory for the people's communes in mountainous areas in fundamentally conquering nature.

Gao Huatang's experience in leading "water management, mountain management, and soil management" not only provides a correct method for transforming mountainous areas, but more importantly, it liberates people's minds. Can the natural appearance of mountainous areas be changed? Most people believe that it can be changed. But can it be changed more quickly? This is a ideological question that many people have not yet resolved. Some people believe that there are many difficulties in transforming mountainous areas. Instead of actively creating conditions and overcoming difficulties, they wait for help from the state and the plains. Others want to develop the plains first, lay a foundation, and then support the mountainous areas, thus failing to fully mobilize the masses in the mountainous areas to change the natural appearance through self-reliance. Obviously, this approach is incorrect. Of course, the plains and advanced areas have better conditions and are generally areas with higher yields. It is necessary to strengthen leadership and provide necessary support to these areas in order to increase the production of more agricultural products. However, it is wrong to neglect the mountainous areas. Transforming poor mountains and bad waters into people's paradises is a very arduous task. The Party's leadership should not be weakened, but must be strengthened. It is necessary for the state to provide certain assistance to the mountainous areas. The state has already done so, but the idea of completely relying on state support to change the appearance of the mountainous areas is unrealistic. Because this would relax efforts to mobilize the broad masses in the mountainous areas to change the backward situation themselves. At the same time, under the current circumstances, the state's funds are limited and it is difficult to fully meet the needs of the mountainous areas. The great significance of the experience of the Party organization and Comrade Gao Huatang of the Construction Management District of Dayan Commune in water management, mountain management, and soil management lies in the fact that it proves that by relying on the strength of the people organized together, fully utilizing the superiority of the people's commune, it is entirely possible to change the backward natural appearance of the mountainous areas in a relatively short period of time. In their work on water management, mountain management, and soil management, they implemented the spirit of self-reliance as the primary focus and striving for external assistance as a supplement. When they didn't have lime, they burned it themselves; when they didn't have explosives, they made them themselves; when they didn't have enough iron crowbars, they used wooden tools instead. More than 80% of the cadres learned how to survey terrain. This formed a vigorous mass movement in which everyone took action and everyone strived to change the backward situation. Experience has proven that this is a way to change the appearance of mountainous areas quickly, well, and economically. In the past two years, the Construction Management District of Dayan People's Commune in Yun County, which was once known as a poor mountainous area with bad waters, has built six main canals and ninety-six branch canals on the mountains, and dug more than one hundred ponds and dams in the ditches, achieving canals on every mountain and ponds in every ditch. A large number of mountain slopes have been converted into terraced fields, with each person averaging one mu of terraced fields and seven fen of terraced land. In 1958, they resisted the largest mountain flood in history, and in 1959, they resisted the historically rare one-hundred-day drought, ensuring freedom from drought and flood, and achieving a bumper grain harvest. The grain output in 1958 increased tenfold compared to 1948. In the past, the state had to supply grain, but this year the grain production per capita has reached the standard of food-rich areas, and more than 1.3 million jin of surplus grain has been sold to the state, achieving self-sufficiency in grain in the mountainous areas. People describe this area, which was once called a poor mountainous area with bad waters, as: "Water flows on the top of the mountains, terraced fields fill the mountain gullies, the fragrance of apples is everywhere, fish swim in the ponds, there is no worry about food or clothing, there is no need for cattle to grind the mill, there is no need for oil to light the lamp, and people in the high mountains will never have worries." Yun County promoted Gao Huatang's experience in water management, mountain management, and soil management, and in just over two months, more than 5,300 mountains and more than 19,000 gullies were transformed into nearly 700,000 mu of terraced fields and terraced land. At the same time, more than 2,000 li of highways and roads were built, rapidly changing the appearance of the mountainous areas. All of these show that under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, by fully utilizing the superiority of the people's commune, strengthening the Party's leadership, and vigorously carrying out mass movements, the appearance of all backward areas can be greatly changed in a relatively short period of time.

The tenacious struggle of the Party organization and Comrade Gao Huatang of Dayan Commune in leading the masses to manage water, mountains, and soil fully demonstrates the communist's ambition to transform the world. It is true that they faced a large mountainous area with poor mountains and bad waters, inconvenient transportation, lack of water sources, limited labor, and limited funds, all of which made the already difficult task of transforming nature even more difficult. In the face of these difficulties, the communist style of each person is tested. Some people are always worried about everything, with many difficulties and obstacles, believing that this is impossible and that cannot be done. Holding these cowardly and lazy worldviews, there is of course no way to go to war with nature and rapidly transform the natural appearance. The style of true communists is completely opposite to these people. They have great ideals and always lead the masses to overcome all difficulties and advance by leaps and bounds with high revolutionary enthusiasm and great drive. There are two different worldviews on the relationship between man and nature: either being manipulated by nature and being a slave to nature, or conquering it and being the master of nature. Comrade Gao Huatang was not intimidated by the various difficulties of natural conditions. He made a great ambition to change the difficult conditions. This management district has long passed down the saying: "Poor mountain gullies, selling firewood villages, poor mountains and bad waters, a bitter place." Comrade Gao Huatang bravely challenged this statement. Under the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses, he put forward a struggle slogan, which is to turn the mountainous area into: "Wanbao Mountain, a land of fish and rice, a rich and beneficial place." When some people could not withstand the test and asked to move from the mountains to the plains, he was able to stand firm, hold high the red flag of transforming the mountainous area, resolutely rely on the masses, summarize the experience of the masses in transforming the mountainous area, and gradually guide the masses to do it, thereby rapidly changing the natural appearance of the entire township.

The experience of Gao Huatang in leading the masses to manage water, mountains, and soil can quickly become the common wealth of the broad masses of the whole province of Hubei, which is due to the correct application of an important Marxist leadership method. This is to continuously summarize the experience of the masses, discover typical examples in a timely manner, vigorously promote typical examples, use typical examples to promote the general, and hold high the red flag to bravely advance. The management district where Gao Huatang is located is a remote mountainous area. The Yun County Party Committee discovered and summarized his experience in a timely manner. The Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee quickly promoted Gao Huatang's experience throughout the entire prefecture, vigorously publicized Gao Huatang's experience, and organized county party secretaries, commune party secretaries, and production team leaders from various counties to visit and study. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee attached great importance to these experiences, organized the first secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees and the first secretaries of the county party committees throughout the province to visit, held on-site meetings to help summarize and further promote these experiences, making these experiences more systematic, complete, and quickly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. After this visit, a massive "three managements" movement quickly unfolded throughout the province. This approach of using typical examples to promote the general is precisely the leadership method that Comrade Mao Zedong often told us. This Marxist leadership method should be vigorously promoted.

The whole country is continuing to leap forward, and the situation in the mountainous areas is extremely good. As the saying goes: "Poverty leads to change." This typical experience of Hubei proves that as long as we strengthen leadership, have correct policies, rely on the communes, and trust the masses, certain unfavorable natural conditions in the mountainous areas can be turned to their own advantage, becoming a huge driving force for building the mountainous areas, making the mountainous areas quickly become a socialist treasure mountain.

    山区面貌可以迅速改观
    湖北省各地在省委领导下推广郧县大堰公社建设管理区党总支书记高华堂同志领导群众治水、治山、治土的经验和枣阳县改造岗地的经验之后，迅速展开一个治水、治山、治土的群众运动，现在，成百上千座荒山改为良田，水利工程遍地开花，许多一向被称为落后地区的自然面貌迅速改观。今天本报发表了这个消息和通讯，这是一个值得普遍重视的重要经验。湖北省郧县和枣阳两县地处山区，土薄石厚。解放前，粮食平均亩产量只有几十斤，人们过着穷困不堪的生活；解放后，中共郧县县委和枣阳县委，曾想了许多办法来改变这种落后面貌，搞了一些农业基本建设，如修水利、开荒地等等，取得了一定成绩，初步改善了人民的生活。但是，由于互助组和初级社组织规模小，力量弱，因而只能治标，不能治本，生产水平仍然是比较低的。高级社，特别是人民公社以后，情况发生了根本的变化，大堰公社建设管理区党组织和总支书记高华堂同志领导群众改造山区的经验就是在这样历史条件下形成的。这就是把治水、治山、治土结合起来，作出统一的规划，其中以治水为中心，治水又以蓄水为主，大搞自流灌溉。在人民公社的统一领导和全面规划下，按水系、按山综合治理。同时结合作好坡地改梯田、梯地、植树造林等治土、治山等工作，这是农业基本建设，是搞好农业生产的基础。这样既可制止山洪暴发冲刷土地，又可自流灌溉，发展多种经营，节省大批劳动力。作到山区水旱无忧，面貌为之改观。这是山区人民公社从根本上征服自然的伟大胜利。
    高华堂领导“治水、治山、治土”的经验，不仅给改造山区找到了一个正确办法，更重要的是它解放了人们的思想。山区的自然面貌能不能改变？一般人都相信可以改变。但是能不能更快地加以改变？这却是许多人还没解决的思想问题。有些人认为改造山区困难多，他们不是积极创造条件，克服困难，而是等待国家和平原地区的帮助；还有人想把平原先搞好，打下个基础，再来支援山区，因而没有充分发动山区群众自力更生地改变自然面貌。显然，这种作法是不正确的。当然，平原和先进地区条件较好，一般都是产量较高的地区，加强对这些地区的领导，给以必要支援，以便增产更多的农产品，这是必要的；但是忽视山区却是不对的。把穷山恶水改变为人民乐园，是个十分艰巨的工作，党的领导不但不应减弱，而且必须加强。国家对山区进行一定的帮助是必要的，国家已经这样作了，但是那种企图完全依赖国家的支援，来改变山区面貌的思想，则是不现实的。因为这样会放松发动山区广大群众自己动手改变落后面貌的努力，同时，在目前的情况下，国家的资金有限，很难完全满足山区的需要。大堰公社建设管理区党组织和高华堂同志创造的治水、治山、治土的经验的重大意义在于，它证明了，依靠人民组织起来的力量，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，完全可以在不太长的时间内改变山区的落后的自然面貌。他们在治水、治山、治土的工作中，贯彻自力更生为主，争取外援为辅的精神，没有石灰，自己烧；没有炸药，自己造；没有足够的铁撬，就用木头工具代替；80％以上的干部学会测量地形。这就形成了一个人人动手，个个争先改变落后面貌的轰轰烈烈的群众运动的局面。经验证明，这是一条多快好省地改变山区面貌的道路。穷山恶水的郧县大堰人民公社建设管理区在近两年内，就在山上修了六条干渠，九十六条支渠，在沟里挖了一百多口塘堰，作到了山山有渠、沟沟有塘，大批山坡改成了梯田，每人平均已有一亩梯田、七分梯地。1958年抗住了有史以来的大山洪，1959年抗住了历史罕见的百天大旱，水旱无忧，粮食丰收。1958年的粮食产量比1948年增长了十倍，过去一向要国家供应粮食，今年粮食生产每人口粮标准赶上了富裕地区，还卖给国家一百三十多万斤余粮，作到了山区粮食自给有余。人们形容这块昔日被称为穷山恶水的地区是：“水在山顶流，梯田满山沟，遍地苹果香，鱼在塘里游，吃不愁，穿不愁，推磨不用牛，点灯不用油，高山人家永无忧。”郧县推广高华堂的治水、治山、治土的经验，两个多月就把五千三百多座山，一万九千多条沟变成了近七十万亩梯田梯地；同时还修公路马路二千多华里，迅速改变了山区的面貌。这些都说明：在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，一切落后地区的面貌完全可以在不太长的时间内大大地改变。
    大堰公社党组织和高华堂同志领导群众治水、治山、治土的顽强斗争，充分表现出共产党人改造世界的雄心壮志。不错，他们面对的是穷山恶水的大山区，交通不便、水源缺乏、劳力不多、资金有限，这一切就使得本来已经是有很多困难的改造自然的工作变得更加困难。在这些困难面前，考验着每一个人的共产主义者的风格。有些人遇事都是忧心忡忡，困难重重，这也不可能，那也办不到，抱着这些懦夫和懒汉的世界观，当然谈不到向自然开战，迅速改造自然面貌。真正共产主义者的风格同这些人完全相反，他们有着伟大的理想，永远是以高度的革命热情和伟大的干劲领导群众排除一切困难，大踏步前进。在对待人和自然界的关系上有着两种不同的世界观：要么是被自然界摆布，作自然界的奴隶；要么是征服它，作自然界的主人。高华堂同志没有被自然条件的各种困难吓倒，他立大志要改变困难条件。这个管理区长期留传着这样的话：“穷山沟，卖柴乡，穷山恶水苦地方”。高华堂同志勇敢地向这种说法挑战，他在党的领导下依靠人民群众，提出了一个斗争口号，这就是要把山区变成：“万宝山，鱼米乡，富山益水好地方”。有些人经不起考验，要求从山上向平原搬家的时候，他能站稳立场，高举改造山区的红旗，坚决依靠群众，总结出群众改造山区的经验，并且逐步引导群众去干，从而使全乡的自然面貌迅速得到改观。
    高华堂领导群众治水、治山、治土的经验，能够迅速地成为湖北全省广大人民的共同财富，这是由于正确地运用了一条重要的马克思主义的领导方法。这就是不断总结群众经验，及时发现典型，大张旗鼓地宣传典型，运用典型推动一般，高举红旗奋勇前进。高华堂所在的管理区是一个偏僻山区，郧县县委及时发现并总结了他的经验。中共襄阳地委很快就把高华堂的经验推广全专区，大张旗鼓地宣传高华堂的经验，组织各县县委书记、公社党委书记、生产队长参观学习。中共湖北省委对这些经验极为重视，组织了全省地委、市委第一书记和各县县委第一书记前往参观，开现场会议帮助总结和进一步推广这些经验，使这些经验更加系统完整和迅速深入人心。经过这次参观，声势浩大的“三治”运动很快地就在全省范围内展开。这种运用典型，推动一般的作法，正是毛泽东同志经常告诉我们的领导方法。这种马克思主义的领导方法，应该大力推广。
    全国在继续跃进，山区的形势极为良好。常言说得好：“穷则思变”。湖北的这个典型经验证明：只要加强领导，政策正确，依靠公社，相信群众，山区的某些不利的自然条件可以走到它自己的反面，变成为建设山区的巨大的推动力，使山区迅速成为社会主义的万宝山。
