    High Output, High Quality, Low Cost; Low Consumption, Safety, High Efficiency
    Three Advanced Factories Achieve Year-Round Success
    Their common experience: 1. In-depth and meticulous political and ideological work; 2. Launching mass movements and technological innovation; 3. Adhering to centralized leadership and strengthening enterprise management.
    
    Shijingshan Power Plant
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 8th, the Shijingshan Power Plant workers have comprehensively completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule, achieving comprehensive and balanced leap forward in high output, high quality, low consumption, safety, high efficiency, and low cost.
    
    As of the end of November, this factory had overfulfilled this year's power generation and total output value plan thirty days ahead of schedule; completed the profit delivery plan thirty-one days ahead of schedule; completed the labor productivity plan thirty-three days ahead of schedule, with labor productivity from January to November increasing by 27.13% compared to the same period last year; completed the annual plan for burning low-quality coal sixty-one days ahead of schedule, and by November, the cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity had been reduced by 9.3% compared to the plan; the major equipment overhaul plan was also completed, and the overhaul quality all reached "excellent" and "good" levels; the safety production situation was very good, with no major personal injury accidents for 789 consecutive days, and no equipment damage accidents for 1,394 consecutive days.
    
    The important reason for the factory's achievements is the resolute implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction, continuous anti-rightist campaigns to boost morale, and the combination of strengthening centralized leadership and launching mass movements, which improved the level of enterprise management and continuously improved operations and innovations. After March, right-leaning thoughts rose, and a few technicians believed that increasing power generation would make it difficult to further reduce coal consumption, and burning low-quality coal would affect power generation. The factory Party committee launched a mass debate, criticizing this one-sided view of separating more, faster, better, and more economical results and seeing only objects and not people, making the workers realize that under the existing technical equipment conditions, as long as they give full play to their subjective initiative, strengthen management, and continuously innovate, they can achieve both more power generation and save coal. The Party Secretary, Factory Director, and Chief Engineer all participated in labor and engaged in "experimental fields," mobilizing workers to continuously improve operations and reduce coal consumption, and using low-quality coal left over from coking at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company to replace good coal for power generation. As a result, power generation exceeded the plan, and coal consumption decreased month by month. As of the end of November, the average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour was 505 grams, a decrease of 31 grams compared to the same period last year. At the beginning of the year, low-quality coal accounted for only 23% of the total coal consumption, but now it accounts for 75%.
    
    The factory focuses on production, and while strengthening centralized leadership, it established and implemented a complete set of democratic management systems, truly making management the business of the workers. Technical and business management work starts from the team and group level, and a team and group production plan task book and team and group accident analysis system have been established, implementing a graded management system for eliminating equipment defects.
    
    Tianjin Tractor Factory
    According to Xinhua News Agency Tianjin, 7th, the Tianjin Tractor Factory has completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule. As of December 4, the total output value plan has been completed by 100%, and labor productivity has increased by about 10% compared to the plan; the tractor output has exceeded the plan by 110 units, and the production plans for gas generators, gasoline engines, gas-gasoline dual-use engines, and the generator supporting tasks have also been completed ahead of schedule. Production costs, from January to the end of November, decreased by 0.36% compared to the state-stipulated targets. The performance of various products has reached the stipulated standards. Other aspects such as profit delivery and capital turnover have also exceeded the plan.
    
    An important experience of this factory in achieving a comprehensive leap forward this year is the establishment and improvement of the production command and management system under the leadership of the Party committee, so that enterprise management adapts to the situation of large-scale mass movements. In terms of planning management, the factory has adopted a method of hierarchical compilation and classification management since the beginning of the year. All levels throughout the factory, from the factory director to the workers, are clear about the completion of the plan, which not only gives full play to the enthusiasm of organizations at all levels, but also organizes balanced production rhythmically, ensuring that the production plan is overfulfilled month after month.
    
    Over the past year, the factory has gradually established and improved various management systems such as operation plans, quota-based material requisition, financial management, and process work; on the principle of streamlining personnel and improving efficiency, it restored the process section and finance section, strengthened the inspection section and tool equipment section, equipped each workshop with process technicians, improved group management, and improved the scheduling meeting system. Therefore, it not only ensures the full exertion of the enthusiasm of all factory employees, but also organizes production evenly on a ten-day basis. Quality has been increasing month by month, costs have been decreasing month by month, and the turnover rate of working capital, one of the important standards reflecting the level of enterprise management, has also doubled compared to last year.
    
    Jilin City Paper Mill
    According to Xinhua News Agency Jilin, 7th, the Jilin City Paper Mill has completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule. The annual total output value plan and variety output plan were completed ahead of schedule on November 6th and 18th respectively; quality increased by 3.4% compared to the planned targets; costs decreased by 1.58% compared to the plan; labor productivity increased by 40% compared to the plan, and profits exceeded the plan by 18.3%.
    
    This year, the planned output of this paper mill increased by 35% compared to last year's actual output. Faced with this arduous production task, the factory's leaders, based on the main problems in production, took charge of their respective responsibilities and went to the workshops to mobilize the masses to overcome difficulties. The leaders of each workshop also went to the work sections to personally grasp production, so that many problems that were previously considered impossible to solve without increasing investment were solved one by one. The pulp produced by the pulping workshop originally could not meet the needs of the paper-making workshop. After workshop director Lang Jingyun participated in production, he discovered that worker Niu Fengjin's operating method was advanced, immediately summarized and promoted it. As a result, without adding a vacuum washer, the daily output of pulp in the entire workshop increased from twelve tons to thirty tons. According to statistics, the factory implemented a total of 120 technical innovations in the second half of the year, which greatly increased labor productivity and played a significant role in reversing the backward production situation.
    
    In terms of production management, at present, 45 groups in the factory have implemented a team and group economic accounting system, strengthening the analysis of economic activities, so that the workers are comprehensively concerned about production, striving to comprehensively achieve leap-forward targets in output value, output, quality, cost, and safety. Therefore, a new situation of high output, high quality, low consumption, and safety has emerged. The consumption of raw materials has also decreased significantly. The cost of products has also decreased accordingly, turning from a loss to a surplus. Due to mobilizing the masses to strengthen equipment maintenance and repair, and implementing safety production regulations, equipment accidents have been basically eliminated since September, increasing the actual effective operating time of the equipment from 14 hours per day in the past to 22.5 hours, achieving daily overproduction.

    高产、优质、低成本　低耗、安全、高效率
    三个先进厂　实现全年红
    他们的共同经验：一、深入细致的政治思想工作；二、大搞群众运动大闹技术革新；三、坚持集中领导加强企业管理。
    石景山发电厂
    据新华社8日讯　石景山发电厂职工提前全面完成今年国家计划，做到了高产、优质、低耗、安全、高效率、低成本全面均衡跃进。
    到11月底止，这个工厂已经提前三十天超额完成了今年发电量和总产值计划；提前三十一天完成了上缴利润计划；提前三十三天完成了劳动生产率计划，1月到11月的劳动生产率比去年同期提高27.13％；提前六十一天完成了全年燃烧低质煤的计划，累计到11月份，每千度电的成本比计划降低9.3％；设备大检修计划也完成了，检修质量全部达到“优”“良”水平；安全生产情况很好，已经连续七百八十九天无重大人身事故，连续一千三百九十四天无设备损坏事故。
    这个厂取得上述成就的重要原因，是坚决执行党的社会主义建设总路线，不断反右倾、鼓干劲，加强集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合，提高了企业管理水平，不断改进操作不断革新的结果。3月份以后，右倾思想抬头，少数技术人员认为多发电就很难再降低煤耗，烧低质煤就会影响多发电。工厂党委就发动群众辩论，批判了这种把多快好省割裂开来和只见物不见人的片面观点，使广大职工认识到在现有的技术设备条件下，只要充分发挥主观能动性，加强管理，不断革新，就能做到既多发电，又省煤。党委书记、厂长和总工程师都亲自参加劳动，搞“试验田”，发动工人不断改进操作，降低煤耗，并且用石景山钢铁公司炼焦剩下来的低质煤代替好煤发电，结果发电量超额完成了计划，煤耗也月月降低。截至11月底的计算，每度电平均耗煤五百零五克，比去年同期降低了三十一克。年初烧的低质煤只占全部用煤量23％，现在已占到75％。
    这个厂以搞好生产为中心，在加强集中领导的同时，建立和实行了一整套的民主管理制度，把管理工作真正变成广大工人的事情。各项技术管理和经营管理工作都从班组做起，建立了班组生产计划任务书、班组事故分析等制度，实行了消灭设备缺陷的分级管理制度。
    天津拖拉机厂
    据新华社天津7日电　天津拖拉机制造厂已经提前全面完成了全年生产计划。到12月4日为止，总产值计划完成100％，劳动生产率比计划提高10％左右；拖拉机比计划超产了一百一十台，煤气机、汽油机、煤气汽油两用机的产量计划，以及发电机的配套任务，也都按品种提前超额完成。生产成本，1至11月底比国家规定的指标下降了0.36％。各种产品的性能都达到了规定的标准。其他如上缴利润、资金周转，也都超额完成了计划。
    这个厂今年实现全面跃进的一条重要经验，是在党委领导下建立和健全了生产指挥和管理系统，使企业管理适应了大搞群众运动的形势。在计划管理方面，工厂从年初开始就采取了逐级编制、分级管理的办法，全厂上下左右，从厂长到工人，对完成计划情况都能心中有数，既发挥了各级组织的积极性，又有节奏地组织均衡生产，保证了生产计划的月月超额完成。
    一年来，这个厂已经逐步建立和健全了作业计划、限额领料、财务管理、工艺工作等各项管理制度；在精简人员提高效率的原则下，恢复了工艺科和财务科，加强了检验科和工具设备科，每个车间都配备了工艺员，健全了小组管理，健全了调度会议制度。因此，既保证了全厂职工干劲的充分发挥，又做到了按旬均衡地组织生产。质量逐月上升，成本逐月下降，反映企业管理水平高低的重要标准之一的流动资金的周转速度，也比去年加快了一倍。
    吉林市造纸厂
    据新华社吉林7日电　吉林市造纸厂已经提前全面完成了今年国家计划。全年总产值计划和品种产量计划，在11月6日和18日就分别提前完成；质量比计划指标提高3.4％；成本比计划降低1.58％；劳动生产率比计划提高40％，利润超过计划18.3％。
    今年这个造纸厂的计划产量比去年实际产量增加35％。面对这一繁重的生产任务，全厂领导干部根据生产中的主要问题，分工负责，到车间发动群众大破难关。各车间的领导干部也下工段亲自抓生产，使许多过去认为非增加投资不能解决的问题，都一一解决。制浆车间生产的纸浆，原来不能满足制纸车间的需要。车间主任郎敬云参加生产后，发现工人牛凤金的操作方法先进，马上加以总结推广，结果没有增添真空洗条机，就使全车间纸浆的日产量由十二吨提高到三十吨。据统计，下半年全厂共实现了一百二十项技术革新，使劳动生产率大大提高，对于扭转生产落后局面起了重大作用。
    在生产管理方面，目前，全厂已有四十五个小组实行班组经济核算制，加强经济活动分析，使工人群众全面地关心生产，力争在产值、产量、质量、成本、安全等方面全面实现跃进指标，因此出现了高产、优质、低耗、安全的新局面。原料的消耗量也显著下降。产品成本也随之下降，由一度亏损变为盈余。由于发动群众加强设备维护检修，贯彻安全生产规程，从9月份以来已经基本上消灭了设备事故，使设备的实际有效作业时间由过去每天十四小时提高到二十二个半小时，实现了日日超产。
