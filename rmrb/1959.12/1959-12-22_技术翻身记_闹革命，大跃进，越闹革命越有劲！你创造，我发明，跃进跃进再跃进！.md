A Record of Technological Transformation
    “Make revolution, Great Leap Forward, The more we make revolution, the more energetic we become! You create, I invent, Leap Forward, Leap Forward again!”
    He Zhenhai Zhou Bide
    In March, a fierce debate unfolded at a Party branch meeting at the Shanghai Zhichengxing Steel Products Factory.

    Due to economic reorganization and support for other factories, the factory's machines this year decreased from the original seven shears to four, and the number of workers decreased from 187 to 127; the area of the site was also greatly reduced. However, the workers, full of enthusiasm, had formulated a plan to double the output value compared to last year. Now, with the reduction of machines, labor, and site, can they still complete such a glorious and arduous task?

    Determined to Turn Things Around
    How can production be doubled?

    Knowing that the branch would not support the practice of working overtime, some people still proposed some ideas such as "Go to work earlier to do some preparatory work, leave work later, and hold on tighter," and so on. However, the branch secretary said, "We can't just rely on physical strength, we must use our brains more."

    Xu Juchu, who lost his right eye in an industrial accident before liberation, blurted out after hearing this, "It's not enough to rely on physical strength, it's easy to have work injuries. Didn't Zhou Bin's waist get twisted when he lifted steel plates before liberation? For many years, he can't even straighten his body in rainy weather. How long are we going to carry steel plates!"

    Someone then chimed in, "To improve labor productivity, we must use machinery to replace manual operations and launch a major technological revolution!"

    This suggestion was immediately supported by the branch secretary. After the meeting, the masses hoped to immediately start a major technological revolution, but some "condition-only theorists" came out to pour cold water, saying, "Our factory has three shortages and one difficulty in carrying out technological revolution. First, we lack machines; second, we lack technical personnel; third, we lack materials. In addition, the processing specifications are complex, and the finished product specifications range from hundreds of pounds to a few cents. It is really difficult to develop a universal machine to adapt to such complex specifications."

    Some people remembered that even if a screw rod was broken in the factory, they had to ask other factories to process and repair it. Their own factory only had a manual vise and a few spanners and chisels in the repair group. There was also only one worker who had learned a few months of lathe skills, which had long been neglected. Thinking about the "three shortages and one difficulty," they felt that there was some truth to it and inevitably felt a little discouraged.

    The Party branch promptly realized that this "condition-only theory" of seeing things but not people had become an obstacle to carrying out the technological revolution. It immediately organized the masses to visit the city's exhibition of simple equipment, the technological revolution achievements of brother factories, and watch dramas such as "Fiery Red Heart" and "People Who Dare to Think and Do." Then, it guided the masses to freely express their opinions and debate, and analyzed the factory's four favorable conditions for carrying out a major technological revolution: first, there was the correct leadership of the higher-level Party committee and the support of brother factories; second, there was the soaring enthusiasm of all the factory's employees and their boundless enthusiasm for the socialist cause; third, the factory had half a turner and shear masters, so it could not be said that there were no technical talents; and another condition was that through the exercise of the steelmaking movement last year, everyone had personally experienced the great power of liberating the mind and forged steel-like will. So, why couldn't they launch a major technological revolution?

    Everyone said they would do it, and dozens of suggestions were immediately sent to the Party branch.

    Treating the Root Cause and the Symptoms
    Another fierce debate.

    When the branch expanded meeting discussed the rationalization proposals of the masses, some cadres laughed as soon as they saw that some workers proposed "shear automation" and "complete set of large-scale lifting and transporting equipment": "Empty talk, unrealistic, can't be done!" But someone immediately retorted: "If it can't be done, don't propose it? As long as you have determination, you are not afraid of any difficulty!"

    After the debate, everyone unified their understanding: The factory is poor is a fact, but if poor, then change, if change, then things will work out, things depend on people. The branch also promptly organized a technological innovation group, with the Party branch secretary personally taking charge, and first classified all the rationalization proposals into three categories: one category was relatively simple and could be realized immediately; one category was more complex but urgently needed to be solved for the current production; and the other category could not be realized temporarily according to the conditions. After the classification was completed, the branch pointed out that the technological revolution should have lofty ambitions, treat the root cause and the symptoms. Treating the symptoms meant to fiercely attack the key to the current production so that the technological revolution would have an immediate effect on production. Treating the root cause meant to create conditions while fiercely attacking the key, start planning and deploy the next larger innovation project, create various large-scale machines, fundamentally and thoroughly change the backward production appearance of the factory that relied solely on heavy physical labor, and encourage the masses to launch a full-scale technological revolution.

    After the direction and steps were clear, the branch led the technological innovation group to fiercely attack the key. At the same time, the innovation projects were announced on the "Talent Recruitment List," calling on everyone to use their hands and brains. In this way, all the masses in the factory automatically organized themselves, three in a group, five in a crowd, each doing their best, cooperating with each other, and immediately contracted all the projects.

    Fiercely Attacking the Key
    The battle began, and people took out the energy they had during the steelmaking last year and rushed straight to the difficulties!

    At that time, the key to production was mainly that the labor intensity of carrying large steel plates was high, and the production efficiency was low, which could not keep up with the needs of the shears. How to overcome this key? Someone suggested: The abandoned overhead crane from the Yutai Rolling Mill, which has been unable to be used for many years under our factory's custodianship, can be dismantled, repaired, and used to solve the problem of transporting steel plates to the shears. The branch immediately supported this suggestion. The technological innovation group and the workshop workers worked together, knocking and disassembling, and transported the Yutai factory's crane to this factory in two days. At that time, someone doubted and said, "Can an abandoned overhead crane that has not been used for eight years be repaired? I heard that capitalists had asked experts to inspect it in the past, and they said it could no longer be used. Aren't we wasting our time trying to do it?"

    The comrades of the technological innovation group laughed and said after hearing this, "We will do what the experts can't do, and we must show the prestige of our workers." After saying that, everyone started to work, removing rust and adding oil to the rusty crane. However, it was not difficult to disassemble, but it could not be assembled properly. The branch secretary and everyone carefully inspected the parts to see if anything was broken. They said, "If it can be disassembled, it must be able to be assembled. Try a few more times, remember the position of each part when it is installed. If it is not right, change the position and install it again!" Everyone thought it was right, so two disassembled, three acted as consultants, repeatedly assembled and disassembled, disassembled and assembled, and tried to assemble dozens of times before finally assembling successfully.

    The runway was built, but how to put a large crossbeam weighing thousands of pounds onto the three-meter-high runway? There was no crane, the workshop was small, there were not enough people to lift it, and there was not enough space for more people to turn the crowbar. Standing on the ladder and lifting, they couldn't exert any strength. At this time, the branch secretary, the chairman of the trade union, and others personally participated in the lifting work. The workshop master, the section cadres, and the canteen cooks also came. Everyone, under the slogan of "Firing the first shot," some used their shoulders to support the crossbeam and lift it up; some stood on high platforms and used ropes to pull the crossbeam up; some stood on ladders and carried it upwards; some used their hands to hold the crossbeam up. With everyone united, the sound of humming filled the air. Lifting, pulling, supporting, and carrying, they finally installed the thousand-pound crossbeam onto the crane track.

    The First Battle Achieved Victory
    The overhead crane was installed. The first test run, it was very difficult to pull. Everyone was not discouraged. After disassembling and studying, they found that the eyes of the overhead crane and the crossbeam were not aligned, so they re-drilled the eyes and tried to assemble again. Until the fourth test run, the steel plate was finally lifted. In the cheers of everyone, several people used all their strength to pull the crane runway pulley. But for some reason, the pulley could not be pulled.

    Failed again. At this time, someone complained, "I said it was a waste of effort. Now it's neither up nor down, and it would be strange if it doesn't delay production. It's better to simply work a twelve-hour shift to complete the task."

    "No!" The firm voice showed the branch secretary's resolute will. Seeing that everyone was tired, he told everyone to rest well and work tomorrow.

    On a spring night, the cold moon was like frost, and the branch secretary paced back and forth in the workshop, touching the overhead crane for a while, and meditating with his head down for a while. He suddenly turned around and saw a few figures in the workshop. It turned out to be the head of the technological innovation group, Communist Youth League member Li Zuotang and a few others. They had been secretly studying since they got off work until now, and after reaching a preliminary conclusion, they ran to the site to do it again. The branch secretary was very excited on the one hand, but on the other hand, he was worried about their health and said, "Why don't you go to rest? Is your body made of iron?"

    Li Zuotang immediately asked back, "Then are you cast from steel?"

    These two sentences are both right. What a steel cast and iron forging, iron forging and steel cast, the Party and the masses, the masses and the Party, this is the general meeting of strength, this is the crystallization of wisdom! Hope, methods, were found in this unparalleled wisdom and strength.

    Several people gathered together and worked hard that night. Li Zuotang remembered that the runway was screwed onto the pillars with U-bolts in the Yutai factory, which could not bear the weight and became loose. The runway was stuck on the crossbeam, so it could not be used. He also used a spirit level to measure that the triangular iron pillar in the southwest corner was a little lower, and the runway was skewed, which naturally stuck the crossbeam and could not move. But to disassemble and reassemble and re-erect the pillars would be too laborious. The old worker Xu Juchu came up with a solution: pad the top of the pillar with a twenty-centimeter-thick iron plate. Find out the problem and act immediately until the east turns white. People who came to work together helped to hold up the crossbeam and lift the runway. Even those who had said "waste of effort" were moved by everyone's tenacious will.

    The overhead crane was finally repaired. The large steel plate that originally required a dozen people to lift can now be lifted lightly as long as two people pull the pulley. A few people straightened the steel plate and sent it to the shears.

    Continue the Efforts
    Having an overhead crane is not enough. It was also decided to build an indigenous crane to use machinery to transport steel plates from the site to the workshop.

    Patching together and running around everywhere for cooperation, the technological innovation group finally assembled the crane.

    The first test run, it could not lift. It was disassembled, and each part was checked, corrected, and reassembled. The second test run, it could lift, but it could not bear a ton of weight. The crane swivel suddenly broke, causing a major turnover, and the parts were broken. But everyone said nothing and started all over again. Difficulties did not frustrate people's will, but made their fighting spirit more firm. Everyone called the crane "King Kong Hercules" and decided not to withdraw until "King Kong" was built.

    The crane was finally built by these "poor and tough guys" and put into production. This indigenous crane that can lift 1.5 tons replaced carrying, which is equivalent to twenty laborers. The workers threw off the crowbars on their shoulders and happily sang:

    “A small blacksmith furnace, forging a King Kong,
    Lifting a large steel plate, saving effort and time!”

    Then, while the iron was hot, they made persistent efforts, and successively realized dozens of technological revolution and technological innovation projects such as flatbed car strip steel conveyors, weighbridges, and so on.

    As for those crowbars, the workers also found a place for them to settle down. They spent seven days building a large shed themselves to serve as an auxiliary workshop. The crowbars flew into the sky and became the eaves of the large shed.

    Obsessed with Innovation
    The fact that they started from scratch shattered the superstitious views of the "condition-only theorists," and the people who liberated their minds established lofty ambitions that overwhelmed mountains and rivers. The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party further encouraged the factory workers' determination to unswervingly implement the general line and resolutely defend the will of the general line. They saw that the steel plates, iron sheets, copper blocks, and aluminum ingots that they processed were sent to Nanchang, Tianjin, Shenyang, and other places; and sent to reservoirs, motor factories, sand-casting factories, machine factories, people's communes, and other industrial and agricultural construction fronts, and felt extremely excited and proud. Their hearts were closely connected with the hearts of people in all posts of the great socialist construction.

    Many people have become "innovation addicts." Now they want to do whatever they see, they want to do whatever they hear, and they will do what they think of. Not long ago, they visited the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition and saw a gantry crane and came back to the factory and started working without saying a word. Now this major technological innovation project has been completed. They heard that the shears in Anshan Iron and Steel are automatic, so they asked people who had been to Anshan Iron and Steel about the shape and structure of this automatic shears, and immediately brainstormed and designed and manufactured it themselves. At present, preparatory work has been completed. They saw a picture of a tower crane somewhere and immediately started preparing to make one themselves. At present, they are fighting with high morale towards higher goals.

　　技术翻身记
    “闹革命，大跃进，越闹革命越有劲！你创造，我发明，跃进跃进再跃进！”
    何振海　周畀德
    3月间，在上海志成兴钢铁制品厂的一次党支部大会上，展开了一场激烈的争论。
    由于经济改组和支援外厂，这个厂今年的机器由原来的七台剪床减少到四台，工人由一百八十七人减少到一百二十七人；场地面积也大大缩小。但是，干劲冲天的工人们曾经制订了产值指标比去年翻上一番的计划。现在在机器、劳动力、场地三减少的情况下，能不能照旧完成这样光荣而艰巨的任务呢？
    决心翻身
    怎样才能实现生产加番？
    有人明知支部不会支持加班加点的做法，还是提出了些什么“早点上班做些准备工作啦，下班后迟点走，手里抓紧点啦”等等意见。但是支部书记说：“我们不能光凭拼体力，要多动脑筋。”
    在解放前因工伤事故而瞎掉右眼的徐菊初听了这话冲口就说：“光拼体力是不行，容易出工伤，周斌的腰不就是解放前抬钢板扭伤的吗？多少年来阴雨天气连身子都伸不直，咱们抬钢板还要抬到什么时候！”
    有人就接上去说：“要提高劳动生产率，就要以机械来代替手工操作，大闹技术革命！”
    这个意见立即得到支部书记的支持。会后，群众希望立即动手大闹技术革命，可是有些“唯条件论”者却出来放冷空气说：“咱厂搞技术革命有三缺加一难，一缺机器，二缺技术人员，三缺材料，再加上加工规格复杂，成品规格重至成百斤，轻至几钱，要搞个万能机械来适应这样复杂的规格，实在很难。”
    有人想起厂内平日连断掉一根螺丝杆还得请外厂加工修制，自己厂内只有检修组一台手工老虎钳和几把扳头凿子，技工也没有，只有一个工人学过几个月的车床手艺，早就荒疏了。想想“三缺一难”的说法，觉得是有些道理，未免有些泄气。
    党支部及时地看出这种见物不见人的“唯条件论”已成为开展技术革命的阻力，便立即组织群众参观了市里举办的简易设备展览会，参观了兄弟厂的技术革命成就，并观看了“烈火红心”、“敢想敢做的人”等话剧，然后引导群众鸣放辩论，分析了厂内大闹技术革命的四个有利条件：一是有上级党委的正确领导和兄弟厂的支援；二是有全厂职工冲天的干劲和对社会主义事业的无限热情；三是本厂有半个车工和剪床老师傅，不能说没有技术人才；还有一个条件就是通过去年炼钢运动的锻炼，大家已经亲身体会到解放思想的巨大力量，炼出了钢铁般的意志。那么，为什么不能大闹技术革命？
    大家说干就干，马上就有几十条建议送到了党支部。
    标本兼治
    又是一场激烈的争论。
    在支部扩大会议讨论群众的合理化建议时，有的干部一看到建议中有的工人提出要“剪床自动化”“整套大型起重运输装置”，就笑起来：“空谈，不切实际，办不到！”但有人立即反驳说：“办不到就不提了吗？只要有决心，天大困难都不怕！”
    经过争辩，大家统一了认识：厂穷是事实，但穷则变，变则通，事在人为。支部又及时组织了技术革新小组，党支部书记亲自挂帅，首先将所有合理化建议分为三类：一类是比较简单马上可能实现的；一类是比较复杂但为当前生产迫切需要解决的；另一类是根据条件暂时不能实现的。分类停当，支部就指出，大闹技术革命要有雄心大志，标本兼治，治标就是要猛攻当前生产上的关键，使技术革命在生产上立显效果；治本就要在猛攻关键的同时创造条件，着手计划并布置下一步更大的革新项目，创造各项大型机械，从根本上彻底改变厂内单凭笨重体力劳动的落后生产面貌，鼓舞群众向技术革命全面大进军。
    方向、步骤明确以后，支部就领导技术革新小组猛攻关键；同时将革新项目公布在“招贤榜”上，号召人人动手，个个动脑。这样，全厂群众都自动组织起来，三个一组，五个一群，各尽所能，相互协作，一下子把所有的项目都包去了。
    猛攻关键
    战斗开始了，人们拿出去年炼钢的劲头，直向困难冲去！
    当时生产上的关键主要是扛运大钢板劳动强度高，生产效率低，跟不上剪床的需要。怎样攻下这个关键呢？有人提出：可以把代管厂裕太轧铁厂的一台多年不能使用的废行车拆下来，加以整修，用它来解决钢板运上剪床的问题。支部立即支持这个意见。技术革新小组和车间工人一起，七手八脚地敲的敲、拆的拆，搞了两天，把裕太厂的行车拆下来运到本厂。当时有人怀疑说：“八年不用的废行车能修好吗？听说过去资本家还请过专家来检验过，说是不能再用了。这样蛮干，不怕竹篮子打水——白忙一场吗？”
    技术革新小组的同志听了这话就笑着说：“专家干不了的咱们来干，一定要显显咱们工人的威风。”说罢，大家动手就干，将那锈痕斑斑的行车去锈加油。可是，拆下来不难，装却装不成样了。支部书记和大家仔细检验各部零件，看看并没有坏。就说：“拆得下，一定装得上，多试几遍，记住每次装的零件部位，不对头，换个部位再装！”大家认为很对，于是两个拆，三个做顾问，反复装上又拆，拆下又装，试装了好几十次，终于装成功了。
    行道架好了，但是怎样把一根成千斤重的大横梁架上三米高的行道上去呢？没有起重机，车间又小，人少了抬不起，人多了用杠棒转不开身，站在扶梯上抬，使不上劲。这时，支部书记、工会主席等都亲自参加了抬运工作，车间老师傅、科室干部、食堂炊事员也来了，大家在“打响第一炮”的口号下，有人用肩膀顶着横梁向上抬；有的站在高台上用绳拴着横梁向上拉；有的站在扶梯上扛着向上走；有的用手托着横梁向上举；万众一心，哼唷之声响成一片，抬的抬、拉的拉、托的托、扛的扛，终于把那千斤横梁安装到行车道上。
    首战告捷
    行车装好了。第一次试车，试拉时费劲很大。大家没有灰心，拆下一研究，发现行车和横梁两个眼子对不起头来，就重钻眼子再试装。直到第四次试车，钢板才被吊起来。在大家欢呼声中，几个人使尽了力气拉行道葫芦。可是不知怎么，葫芦却拉不动了。
    又失败啦。这时就有人埋怨说：“我说是白费劲，现在上不上下不下，不耽误了生产才怪，还是干脆干个十二小时一班，倒能完成任务。”
    “不行！”斩钉截铁的声音显示了支部书记的坚毅意志。他见大家累了，就叫大家好好休息，明天再干。
    春夜，寒月如霜，支部书记在车间里来回踯躅，一会儿摸摸行车，一会儿低头沉思。他猛回头看到了车间里有几个人影。原来是技术革新小组长、共青团员李佐棠等几个人，他们从下班起一直偷偷地研究到现在，初步得出结论后，现在又跑来现场再干。支部书记看了一方面感到很兴奋，一方面又耽心他们的身体说：“你们怎么还不去休息，身体是铁打的吗？”
    李佐棠马上反问一句：“那么你难道是钢浇的吗？”
    这两句话都说得对。好一个钢浇铁打，铁打钢浇，党和群众，群众和党，这就是力量的总汇，这就是智慧的结晶！希望，办法，就在这无比的智慧和力量中给找出来了。
    几个人聚在一起，当夜就猛干。李佐棠想起行道在裕太厂是用骑马螺丝旋在支柱上的，吃不起份量，松弛了，行道卡住横梁，所以不能用。他又用水平尺测量出现在西南角那根三角铁支柱低了一些，行道偏侧，自然卡住横梁动弹不得了。但是要重新拆装再架支柱，实在太费手脚，老工人徐菊初就想出一个办法：在柱头上垫二十厘米厚的铁板。找出毛病，立刻动手，直到东方发白。上班的人一起帮助顶起横梁抬行道，连说过“白忙一场”的人也为大家顽强的意志感动了。
    行车终于修成了，原来要十几个人抬的大钢板，现在只要两个人拉葫芦，它就轻轻地被吊起来，几个人扶正钢板，就可送上剪床去了。
    再接再厉
    有了行车还不行，还决定要造一辆土吊车，好用机械从场地运钢板到车间里来。
    七拼八凑，到处奔波，到处搞协作，技术革新小组终于把吊车装配起来。
    第一次试车，吊不动，拆下来，一个个零件核对，重新改正再装配；第二次试车，吊动了，吃不到一吨重，吊车转轴突然断了，来个大翻身，零件都摔坏了。但大伙儿二话没说，又从头再搞。困难没有挫折人们的意志，而是使斗志更坚定。大家叫吊车为“金刚大力士”，并且决定“金刚”不造成，决不收兵。
    吊车终于也被这些“穷汉硬汉”造起来投入生产了，这台能吊一点五吨的土吊车代替了扛运，足抵上二十个劳动力，工人们甩掉了肩上的杠棒，愉快地唱起来：
    “小小打铁炉，打出铁金刚，
    吊起大钢板，省力省辰光！”
    接着趁热打铁，一鼓作气，又接连实现了平板车条钢输送机、地磅等等几十项技术革命和技术革新项目。
    至于那些扛棒，工人们也给它们找到安身之处，他们花了七天时间，自己动手盖了个大凉棚做辅助车间，扛棒飞上了天，成了大凉棚的屋檐。
    革新成迷
    白手起家的事实粉碎了“唯条件论”者的迷信观点，解放了思想的人们树立了气吞山河的雄心大志，党的八届八中全会决议更鼓舞了这个厂工人们坚定不移贯彻执行总路线和坚决保卫总路线的意志。他们看到了自己加工好的钢板、铁皮、铜块、铝锭被送到了南昌、天津、沈阳等地；被送到了水库、电机厂、翻砂厂、机器厂、人民公社等工农业建设战线上，感到无比的兴奋和自豪。他们的心和伟大的社会主义建设的各个岗位上的人们的心紧紧地连结在一起。
    许多人已经成了“革新迷”。现在他们是看到什么就要做什么，听到什么就想干什么，而且想到就要做到。不久前，他们参观上海市工业展览会，看到一台落地龙门行车，回厂来二话不说，动手就干，现在这项重大的技术革新项目已经完成了。他们听说鞍钢的剪床是自动的，就向到过鞍钢的人打听这台自动剪床的形状和结构，并且马上群策群力，自设计自动手，目前已完成了准备工作。他们不知从哪里看到一张塔式起重机的实物图样，立刻就动手准备自制一座。目前他们正斗志高昂地向更高的目标奋勇前进。
