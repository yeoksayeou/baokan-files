Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 9th -- Li Dagui, the founder of "drawing water up the mountains" in Hubei Province, after "seeking grain from water"—converting dry land into paddy fields—immediately followed with "seeking labor from water," achieving new successes. Now, in Li Dagui's hometown—Xijiadian Commune in Jun County—in addition to all paddy fields achieving self-flowing irrigation, various water-powered processing tools such as water-powered mills, water-powered rice rollers, water-powered cotton gins and cotton carding machines, water-powered bellows (bellows used for iron smelting and red-hot sand casting furnaces), as well as water-powered electricity generation, water-powered vegetable cutting, straw chopping, sawing wood, papermaking, weaving, etc., have all been either successfully tested or widely promoted. According to rough calculations from Star Team One, where Li Dagui lives, the use of water power for processing can save at least more than 30,000 man-days and more than 6,000 animal-days in a year.

Since the spring of 1955, when Communist Party member Li Dagui took the lead in building the first "drawing water up the mountains" hillside canal, the entire commune has now achieved a situation where canals crisscross every team and village, with water flowing year-round. This not only facilitates irrigation but also creates conditions for the full utilization of water power. In 1956, they installed the first water-powered mill. Later, the ways to comprehensively utilize water power increased, especially after the establishment of the commune, which set up a farm tool factory and a comprehensive processing factory. Initially, the farm tool factory used eight people in shifts to pull the bellows for sand casting. Once the furnace was started for sand casting, the carpenters and bamboo craftsmen in the factory had to stop their other work and help pull the bellows, which not only delayed other work but also made people very tired. Later, they switched to water-powered bellows. The bellows worked automatically, and they could cast two to three hundred plowshares a day. The comprehensive processing factory used to use oxen to pull the rollers (to crush tree bark, rice straw, and other papermaking materials), and one person with one ox could crush one hundred catties of tree bark a day. Now, they have switched to water-powered rollers, eliminating the need for oxen. One person can watch over the rollers and crush five hundred catties of tree bark a day, increasing efficiency fourfold. The commune's iron smelting also uses water-powered bellows for blowing air. These bellows have a strong wind power, save labor, and the iron is smelted well.

Li Dagui and others have also conducted other water utilization experiments, such as using water power to automate the cutting of vegetables, radish slices, sweet potato slices, and sweet potato shreds in public canteens, chopping straw in cattle sheds, sawing wood by carpenters, and weaving cloth by textile workers, all of which have been successfully tested.

### 从“向水要粮”到“向水要劳力”  李大贵利用水力取得新成就

    从“向水要粮”到“向水要劳力”
    李大贵利用水力取得新成就
    新华社武汉9日电　湖北省“引水上山”的创始人李大贵，在“向水要粮食”——改旱地为水田以后，紧接着又“向水要劳力”，取得了新的成就。现在，在李大贵的家乡——均县习家店公社，除了全部水田做到自流灌溉以外，各种水力加工工具如水力磨、水力碾、水力轧花机和弹花机、水力风箱（炼铁、翻砂红炉用的风箱）以及水力发电、水力切菜、铡草、锯木、造纸、织布等等，都已先后试验成功或广泛推广。仅据李大贵居住的明星一队粗略计算，一年内利用水力加工至少可以节省三万多个人工和六千多个畜工。
    自从1955年春天，共产党员李大贵带头修成第一条“引水上山”的盘山渠起，现在全公社已经做到队队村村渠路纵横，常年流水。这样，不仅有利灌溉，还为充分利用水力创造了条件。1956年他们安装了第一盘水力磨。后来综合利用水力的门路越来越多，特别是公社成立后，社里办了农具厂和综合加工厂。起初农具厂翻砂，用八个人换班拉风箱。翻砂一开了炉，厂里的木匠、篾匠都要停下来，帮忙拉风箱，既耽误了别的活，人也很累。后来他们改用水力风箱，风箱呼拉呼拉地自动干起来，一天能翻造两三百个犁铧。综合加工厂造纸，原来用牛拉碾（碾树皮、稻草等造纸原料），一天一个人一头牛碾一百斤树皮，现在改用水力碾，不用牛了，一人看守一天碾五百斤树皮，提高工效四倍。公社炼铁也是用水力风箱鼓风的，这种风箱风力大，省了人，铁还炼得好。
    李大贵等还进行了其他用水的试验，如公共食堂里切菜、切萝卜片、红薯片和红薯丝，牛房里铡草，木匠锯木，纺织工人织布等等，利用水力自动化都试验成功了。
