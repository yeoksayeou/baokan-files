Upholding the Party's General Line is a Serious Class Struggle
Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, summarized China's long-term revolutionary experience, especially the experience of socialist construction in recent years, and with reference to the construction experience of the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries, put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This line is a creative Marxist-Leninist line, a model of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's specific revolutionary and construction practices. This line is so full of revolutionary spirit, so full of scientific spirit, and so highly embodies the wishes and will of the people of the whole country that as soon as it was put forward, "the all-powerful historical boiler all boiled," making the great power contained in the socialist system, which is infinitely superior to the capitalist system, and the great power contained in the liberated, united, and organized 600 million people, greatly brought into play. A vigorous mass movement of large-scale economic construction appeared, a comprehensive great leap forward in socialist construction was formed, and people's communes with infinite vitality and great superiority were born. This is the great victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction.

Like the Party's general line for democratic revolution and the general line for socialist revolution, the general line for socialist construction is a proletarian line. Only by firmly standing on the proletariat's position and being a thorough proletarian revolutionary can we deeply understand the revolutionary and scientific nature of the general line for socialist construction and wage an unyielding struggle for its thorough realization. Like the realization of the Party's general line for democratic revolution and the general line for socialist revolution, the realization of the Party's general line for socialist construction requires struggle, requires a serious class struggle. Isn't the right opportunist attack on the Party's general line, and the anti-right opportunist struggle we launched to defend the general line, a powerful proof?

After the basic victory of the socialist revolution on our country's economic front, some people thought that classes had been eliminated and class struggle had been extinguished. The bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism during the Party's rectification campaign, shattering these people's naive illusions. After the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts as a result of the anti-rightist struggle, some people again thought that classes had been eliminated and class struggle had been extinguished. This attack on the Party by right opportunist elements once again shattered their naive thoughts. Will class struggle disappear after the complete victory of this struggle against right opportunism? The answer is definitely no. As long as the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie exists, as long as the habits and forces of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie exist, classes will still exist, and class struggle will still exist. The nature of this struggle is still the serious question of "who will win." Will the proletariat defeat the bourgeoisie, or will the bourgeoisie defeat the proletariat? Will socialism defeat capitalism, or will capitalism defeat socialism? The question is so obvious and sharply posed. The exploiting classes that are about to be eliminated will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. Even in hopeless situations, they will carry out desperate struggles, especially in the ideological struggle, in the struggle of worldviews. We can foresee that this struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will, for a long time, fluctuate like waves with changes in the domestic and international situation, sometimes sharp, sometimes moderate, until classes are completely eliminated, until the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie is completely eliminated, and then this struggle will stop. Therefore, class analysis and the class line are far from outdated, and maintaining a high degree of class vigilance is still very necessary. Lenin said in "Greetings to the Hungarian Workers": "The elimination of classes requires a long, difficult, and tenacious class struggle. After overthrowing the bourgeois regime, after destroying the bourgeois state, after establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle does not disappear (as imagined by the philistines in the old socialism and old social democracy), but only changes its form and becomes more brutal in many ways." Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere, are still protracted, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its own worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its own worldview. In this respect, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not yet been truly resolved." The actual situation in recent years has fully proved that Lenin's and Comrade Mao Zedong's summaries of the laws of class struggle in the transition period are completely correct and extremely brilliant.

The current struggle against right opportunism is not accidental but inevitable. It is a new historical condition under which the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads and the struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois ideologies have continued for ten years. It is both a political class struggle and an ideological class struggle. The outcome of this struggle is related to the fate of our Party, country, and people. In this struggle, we have already achieved great victories, but we must resolutely carry it through to the end, expose all right opportunist elements, and thoroughly smash all right opportunist fallacies. We know that earnestly implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction can mobilize all positive factors, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, develop all socialist construction undertakings at high speed, build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science and culture. It will also prepare the basis for the transition to communism in terms of material and spiritual conditions. Opposing the Party's general line is, in effect, opposing the Party's leadership, opposing socialism, and opening the way for the restoration of capitalism in our country. However, right opportunist elements slander the large-scale mass movement, the great leap forward, and the high-speed development of socialist construction as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism," attack the "premature and poorly run people's communes," and oppose putting politics in command. In the final analysis, they are essentially opposed to the Party's general line for socialist construction. It can be seen that our political differences with right opportunism are concentrated on the struggle to uphold the general line and oppose the general line. Without thoroughly exposing and criticizing right opportunism, without thoroughly crushing right opportunism, we cannot defend and uphold the Party's general line, and we cannot build socialism at high speed.

Socialist construction itself is a revolution, a revolution to change the "poverty and blankness" of our country; and under the conditions permitted by objective possibilities, the faster the revolution, the better. Revolution cannot succeed without the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people, without a magnificent mass movement. Under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, the broad masses of the people are full of energy and striving to achieve something, creating a comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction. This is an extremely good thing, and it is a high tide of proletarian revolutionary enthusiasm. To say that this is "petty-bourgeois fanaticism" can only be the logic of the bourgeoisie, and it is the bourgeoisie's resistance to the socialist cause of the proletariat. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, a large number of facts proved that although advanced cooperatives were more advantageous than elementary cooperatives, they could no longer fully adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward and could not meet the requirements of the continued development of productive forces. Therefore, the establishment of people's communes with larger scale, wider scope of activities, and higher collectivity became an urgent demand of the broad masses of peasants whose socialist consciousness had been greatly improved. The people's commune movement quickly unfolded with irresistible force and quickly embarked on the road of consolidation, soundness, and development, fully proving that the people's communes were not only established in a timely manner but also managed very well. Right opportunist elements opposed the people's communes, in fact, representing the desperate resistance of the already declining classes and a part of the wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas against socialism. In our country's socialist revolution and construction, adhering to the policy of putting politics in command, strengthening the Party's unified leadership over all undertakings, and using Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's specific revolutionary practice, to guide all work, is the fundamental guarantee for continuous victories. "Following the Communist Party and listening to Chairman Mao is victory." This is the conclusion drawn by the broad masses of people based on their long-term personal experience. Right opportunist elements oppose this kind of putting politics in command. In reality, they demand that their group of reactionary bourgeois representatives be in command, that reactionary bourgeois ideology be in command, so as to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism in our country.

All of this shows that, under the new historical conditions, the struggle to uphold the general line and the struggle to oppose the general line is the manifestation of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. It is extremely wrong to have insufficient understanding or any neglect of the serious significance of the struggle against right opportunism.

Some people believe that right opportunist elements are few in number and cannot achieve anything significant, so they are not a cause for concern. Indeed, they are few in number, and we should not overestimate their role. We should not think that they can overturn the Party and the people's great ship, or that they can turn the wheels of history rolling toward socialism and communism to the capitalist road. They do not have such great power. The rapid victory of the current struggle against right opportunism is the best proof. However, we must not underestimate their role either. It must be seen that although they are few in number, and although they have never been Marxists, they oppose Marxism-Leninism under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, which has extreme deceptiveness and corrosiveness. Lenin said as early as in "The Historical Destiny of the Doctrine of Marx" that "The theoretical victory of Marxism has forced its enemies to disguise themselves as Marxists, such is the dialectic of history. Liberalism, whose internal organs have rotted, is trying to revive itself in the form of socialist opportunism." Under our country's socialist system, especially after the basic and decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front and the political and ideological front, the Party's prestige is so high, and the prestige of socialism is so high, that anyone who openly, blatantly, and nakedly opposes the Party's leadership, opposes socialism, and demands to take the capitalist road will have their reactionary face exposed at once. This situation forces right opportunist elements to use sophistry to replace dialectics, to replace the heavens and the earth by saying that the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, which represent the truth of Marxism-Leninism, are petty-bourgeois fanaticism, are "left" leaning adventurism, and to say that their right opportunism, which represents the bourgeois ideology, is Marxism-Leninism, so as to confuse the public, reverse black and white, and deceive the people. Because these right opportunist elements are within the Party, and some of them have a certain revolutionary history and political status, before their right opportunist faces are thoroughly exposed, they may have a certain deceptive effect on the masses. We know that fortresses are most easily breached from within. Therefore, our carrying the struggle against right opportunism to the end is not making a fuss over a trifle, but making a big deal out of a big problem. If we don't do this, we will not be able to make right opportunist elements repent and thoroughly transform themselves, nor will we be able to make some people who are wavering in the face of major issues firm. Without this, we cannot make the whole Party, on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and under the banner of Comrade Mao Zedong, be of one heart and one mind, unite as one, and go all out to struggle heroically for the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction. Of course, because these right opportunist elements within the Party still vaguely have socialist demands, our contradiction with right opportunist elements generally belongs to the contradictions among the people. In this struggle, we must adhere to the policy of "unity-criticism-unity" and the policy of "learning from past mistakes to avoid them in the future, and curing the sickness to save the patient."

Some people say that right opportunist elements only made mistakes accidentally because they saw the shortcomings in our work a little more seriously. This view is not in accordance with the facts. The essence of their mistakes is that they hold a bourgeois worldview. Ideologically speaking, our struggle with right opportunist elements, in the final analysis, is the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. Although some right opportunist elements have participated in the revolution for many years and have been members of the Party for many years, they have not accepted the Party's highest program, accepted the Party's education, and fundamentally transformed themselves, but stubbornly adhere to their own bourgeois worldview. They were active in the democratic revolution stage and had done some beneficial work for the people. However, when the socialist revolution was carried out, when the socialist revolution was carried through to the end, and when the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement were about to completely dig out the roots of private ownership of the means of production, they, as the spokesmen of the bourgeoisie within the Party, would stand up to oppose it. In short, we want socialism and communism, and they want capitalism; we want materialism and dialectics, and they want idealism and metaphysics. This is the fundamental difference in politics and ideology.

What we want to point out here is that although some people do not oppose the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and are different from right opportunist elements, they have serious right-leaning ideas, serious individualism and departmentalism, serious decline in revolutionary will, and always show serious wavering at the juncture of class struggle. Although these people have not developed to the degree of right opportunism, their worldview is also a bourgeois worldview. If they do not learn a lesson from this struggle and resolve to abandon the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian worldview, they will sooner or later fall into the quagmire of right opportunism.

In this serious class struggle against right opportunism and defending the Party's general line, we have more deeply realized that Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership is the source of all our victories. We must honestly be Comrade Mao Zedong's students, study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and use Comrade Mao Zedong's way of thinking to guide all our work. Only in this way can we, at any time and under any circumstances, resolutely wage a resolute struggle against all bourgeois ideologies that oppose the Party's general line, and advance victoriously under the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

    坚持党的总路线是一场严重的阶级斗争
    中共山东省委第一书记　舒同
    党中央和毛泽东同志，根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，总结了中国长期的革命经验，特别是近几年来社会主义建设的经验，并且参考了伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家的建设经验，提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，这条路线是创造性的马克思列宁主义的路线，是马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国具体的革命和建设实践相结合的典范。这条路线是这样富于革命精神，是这样富于科学精神，是这样高度地体现了全国人民的愿望和意志，它一提出来，“神通广大的历史锅炉全部沸腾起来了”，使得比资本主义制度无限优越的社会主义制度中间蕴蓄着的伟大力量，使得解放了的、团结和组织起来了的六亿人民中间蕴蓄着的伟大力量，大大地发挥了出来。经济建设中如火如荼的大规模的群众运动出现了，社会主义建设事业全面大跃进的局面形成了，具有无限生命力和巨大优越性的人民公社诞生了。这是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利。
    同党的民主革命总路线和社会主义革命总路线一样，社会主义建设总路线是一条无产阶级的路线。只有坚定地站在无产阶级的立场上，作一个彻底的无产阶级的革命家，才能深刻地认识社会主义建设总路线的革命性和科学性，才能为它的彻底实现而进行不屈不挠的斗争。同实现党的民主革命总路线和社会主义革命总路线一样，党的社会主义建设总路线的实现，是要经过斗争的，要经过严重的阶级斗争的。右倾机会主义对党的总路线发起的攻击，以及我们为了保卫总路线而展开的一场反对右倾机会主义的斗争，不就是有力的证明吗？
    在我国经济战线上的社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，有人以为阶级消灭了，阶级斗争熄灭了，资产阶级右派趁党整风的机会向党向社会主义发起的猖狂进攻，打破了这些人的天真的幻想。反右派斗争的结果，在政治和思想战线上的社会主义革命取得决定性胜利以后，又有人以为阶级消灭了，阶级斗争熄灭了，这次右倾机会主义分子对党进行的攻击，又一次打破了他们的天真的想法。在这次反对右倾机会主义的斗争取得彻底胜利以后，阶级斗争会不会消灭呢？肯定地说，不会的。只要资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响还存在，只要资产阶级和小资产阶级的习惯势力还存在，阶级就仍然存在，阶级斗争就仍然存在。这种斗争的性质仍然是“谁战胜谁”的严重问题。是无产阶级战胜资产阶级，还是资产阶级战胜无产阶级？是社会主义战胜资本主义，还是资本主义战胜社会主义？问题就是这样明显而尖锐地摆着的。将要被消灭的剥削阶级不会自动地退出历史舞台，就是在毫无希望的情况下，它们也会进行绝望挣扎，特别是在意识形态方面的斗争，在世界观方面的斗争，更是如此。我们可以预见到，无产阶级和资产阶级的这种斗争，在很长的时间内，会随着国内形势和国际形势的变化，像波浪一样起伏，时而尖锐，时而缓和，直到阶级完全消灭，直到资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响完全消灭，这种斗争才会停息。因此，阶级分析和阶级路线远远没有过时，经常保持高度的阶级警惕性仍然是十分必要的。列宁在“向匈牙利工人致敬”一文中说：“消灭阶级要经过长期的、艰难的、顽强的阶级斗争。在推翻资产阶级政权以后，在破坏资产阶级国家以后，在建立无产阶级专政以后，阶级斗争并不是消失（如旧社会主义和旧社会民主党中的庸人所想像的那样），而只是改变它的形式，在许多方面变得更加残酷。”毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这一著作中说：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”几年来的实际情况充分证明列宁和毛泽东同志关于过渡时期阶级斗争规律的概括，是完全正确和十分英明的。
    当前反对右倾机会主义的斗争不是偶然的，而是不可避免的。它是十年来社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级两种思想的斗争在新的历史条件下的继续，它既是一场政治上的阶级斗争，也是一场思想上的阶级斗争。这场斗争的胜负，关系着我们党、国家和人民的命运。在这场斗争中，我们已经取得极大的胜利，但是必须坚决地把它进行到底，把一切右倾机会主义分子揭露出来，把一切右倾机会主义的谬论彻底粉碎。我们知道，认真贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，就可以调动一切积极因素，把社会主义革命进行到底，高速度地发展一切社会主义建设事业，把我国建成为具有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国，并从物质条件和精神条件方面为过渡到共产主义准备基础。反对党的这条总路线，实际上就是反对党的领导，反对社会主义，为资本主义在我国的复辟开辟道路。但右倾机会主义分子却污蔑大搞群众运动、大跃进、高速度地发展社会主义建设事业是“小资产阶级的狂热性”，攻击“人民公社办早了，办糟了”，反对政治挂帅。归根到底，他们实质上是反对党的社会主义建设总路线。可见，我们同右倾机会主义的政治分歧，就集中地表现在坚持总路线和反对总路线的斗争上面。不彻底揭露和批判右倾机会主义，不彻底粉碎右倾机会主义，我们就不能保卫和坚持党的总路线，就不能高速度地建设社会主义。
    社会主义建设本身就是革命，革“一穷二白”之命；而且在客观可能性许可的条件下，革得越快越好。革命离开广大群众的积极性和创造性，离开波澜壮阔的群众运动，是断断不能成功的。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，广大群众干劲冲天，奋发有为，造成社会主义建设事业全面大跃进的局面，这是极大的好事，是无产阶级革命热情的高涨。说这是“小资产阶级狂热性”，只能是资产阶级的逻辑，是资产阶级对无产阶级的社会主义的事业的反抗。在1958年大跃进中，大量的事实证明，高级合作社虽比初级社有更多的优越性，但已经不能完全适应大跃进的形势，不能满足生产力继续发展的要求，因此，成立规模更大、活动范围更广、集体性更高的人民公社，成了社会主义觉悟大大提高的广大农民群众的迫切要求。人民公社运动以不可阻挡之势迅速地展开并迅速地走上巩固健全和发展的道路，充分证明人民公社既办得及时，又办得很好，右倾机会主义分子反对人民公社，实际上是代表已经没落的阶级和一部分有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农对社会主义的绝望反抗。在我国社会主义革命和建设中，坚持政治挂帅的方针，加强党对一切事业的统一领导，用马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国具体的革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想指导一切工作，是不断取得胜利的根本保证。“跟共产党走，听毛主席的话，就是胜利”，这是广大人民群众根据自己长期的亲身的经验得出的结论。右倾机会主义分子反对这样的政治挂帅，实际上就是要求由他们这帮反动的资产阶级代表挂帅，由反动的资产阶级思想挂帅，来为资本主义在我国的复辟开辟道路。
    这一切说明，在新的历史条件下，坚持总路线和反对总路线的斗争，就是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的表现形式。对反对右倾机会主义的斗争的严重意义认识不足，或有任何忽视，都是极端错误的。
    有人认为，右倾机会主义分子为数很少，成不了什么气候，不足为患，何必小题大作。的确，他们的人数很少，不能把他们的作用估计得过高，不能认为他们可以把党和人民的大船摇翻，可以把向社会主义和共产主义滚滚前进的历史车轮扭转到资本主义道路上去。他们没有这样大的力量。这次反对右倾机会主义的斗争之迅速取得伟大的胜利，就是最好的证明。但也不可把他们的作用估计过低。要看到，虽然他们人数很少，虽然他们从来不是马克思主义者，但是他们打着马克思列宁主义的招牌反对马克思列宁主义，这就具有极大的欺骗性和腐蚀性。列宁早在“马克思学说的历史命运”这一著作中就说过：“马克思主义在理论上的胜利，逼得它的敌人装扮成马克思主义者，历史的辩证法就是如此。内脏腐烂了的自由主义，企图在社会主义的机会主义形态下复活起来。”在我国社会主义制度下面，特别是在经济战线上、政治思想战线上的社会主义革命取得基本的、决定性的胜利以后，党的威信是这样高，社会主义的威信是这样高，谁要公开地、露骨地、赤裸裸地反对党的领导，反对社会主义，要求走资本主义道路，其反动面目是会一下子就被识破的。这种情况逼得右倾机会主义分子用诡辩论代替辩证法，偷天换日地把代表马克思列宁主义真理的总路线、大跃进和人民公社说成是小资产阶级的狂热性，是“左”倾冒险主义，而把他们代表资产阶级思潮的右倾机会主义说成是马克思列宁主义，借以混淆视听，颠倒黑白，蒙蔽和欺骗人们。由于这些右倾机会主义分子是处在党内的，其中有些人还有一定的革命的历史和政治地位，在他们右倾机会主义的真面目没有彻底揭露出来以前，对于群众就可能有某种迷惑作用。我们知道，堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。因此，我们把反对右倾机会主义的斗争进行到底，不是小题大作，而是大题大作。不如此，我们既不能使右倾机会主义分子悔过自新，彻底改造自己，也不能使一些在大是大非面前动摇不定的人们坚定起来。不如此，我们就不能使全党在马克思列宁主义的基础上，在毛泽东同志的旗帜下，同心同德，团结一致，鼓足干劲，为贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线而英勇奋斗。当然，由于这些党内右倾机会主义分子还模模糊糊地有社会主义的要求，我们同右倾机会主义分子的矛盾一般地属于人民内部的矛盾，在这一斗争中，我们必须坚持“团结—批评—团结”的方针，“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针。
    有人说，右倾机会主义分子只是由于把我们工作中的缺点看得严重一点，偶然地犯了错误。这种看法是不符合事实的。他们犯错误，本质上是由于他们抱有资产阶级世界观。从意识形态上说，我们同右倾机会主义分子的斗争，归根到底，是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的斗争。一些右倾机会主义分子虽然参加革命多年，入党多年，但是他们并没有接受党的最高纲领，接受党的教育，根本改造自己，而是顽固地坚持着自己的资产阶级世界观。他们在民主革命阶段上有积极性，对人民也曾作了某些有益的工作，但是当进行社会主义革命的时候，当把社会主义革命进行到底的时候，当大跃进和人民公社运动要彻底挖掉生产资料私有制的根子的时候，他们作为资产阶级在党内的代言人，就要起来反对了。总之，我们要社会主义和共产主义，他们要资本主义；我们要唯物主义和辩证法，他们要唯心主义和形而上学。这就是在政治上和意识形态方面的根本分歧所在。
    在这里我们要指出的是，有一些人虽然对党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社并不反对，与右倾机会主义分子有所区别，但是他们有严重的右倾思想，严重的个人主义和本位主义，革命意志严重衰退，在阶级斗争关头总是表现严重的动摇。这些人虽然没有发展到右倾机会主义的程度，但是他们的世界观也是资产阶级的世界观。如果他们不从这次斗争中吸取教训，决心抛弃资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观，他们迟早是会堕入右倾机会主义泥坑的。
    在这场反对右倾机会主义、保卫党的总路线的严重的阶级斗争中，我们更加深刻地体会到，毛泽东同志的领导是我们一切胜利的泉源。我们要老老实实地做毛泽东同志的学生，学习毛泽东同志的著作，用毛泽东同志的思想方法指导一切工作，只有这样，才能在任何时候，在任何情况下，毫不动摇地同一切反对党的总路线的资产阶级思潮进行坚决的斗争，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜下胜利地前进。
