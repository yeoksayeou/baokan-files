Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 8th: Soviet higher education institutions are further strengthening the connection between scientific research and production practice, and directly participating in the technological innovation of production.

Currently, many universities and colleges have established regular contact and cooperative relationships with factories and enterprises. This close connection not only enriches students' production knowledge but also contributes to technological progress in enterprises. Students at the Ural Polytechnic Institute have established connections with seventeen enterprises in Sverdlovsk. Based on the tasks proposed by these enterprises, they have conducted over a thousand technical studies, and hundreds of research results have been adopted by the enterprises, saving them a significant amount of funds. More than 300 students from the Stalingrad Mechanical Institute, together with workers and engineering technicians from factories such as the "Red October" in Stalingrad, are jointly researching the technical problems existing in these factories. The "gas fuel iron smelting furnace" designed by Yaloshenko, a student at the Mechanical Institute, has received high praise and has been adopted by the factory.

Students in Soviet higher education institutions not only participate in the research of technical topics in enterprises but also design and manufacture new machines, instruments, and various equipment in the school's design offices, laboratories, and technical workshops, and accept orders from factories. For example, students at the Ulyanov-Lenin Electrical Engineering Institute in Leningrad manufacture the latest tools and instruments themselves, and they also accept orders to manufacture a batch of universal instruments for the Leningrad National Economic Council.

Students in Soviet higher education institutions have also devised many ways to make their scientific research work more practical and enrich their production knowledge. The Kazan Aviation Institute has transformed the institute's production practice workshop into a factory for manufacturing drawing machinery, where the entire process from design and composition to production is carried out by the students themselves. The institute has also established a design department to design modern aviation sports equipment, and plans to manufacture these equipment themselves in the future. (Attached picture)

    学校工厂建立经常联系
    学生研究新技术设计新机器制成新产品
    据新华社莫斯科8日电　苏联高等院校学生正进一步加强科学研究工作与生产实践的联系，并直接参加生产技术的革新工作。
    目前许多高等学校都同工厂企业建立了经常的联系和合作关系。这种紧密的联系既丰富了学生的生产知识，也有助于企业中的技术进步。乌拉尔工学院的学生与斯维德洛夫斯克的十七个企业建立了联系，他们根据这些企业提出的任务，已经进行了一千多个技术专题研究，有几百项研究结果已被企业采用，结果为这些企业节约了大量资金。斯大林格勒机械学院有三百多名学生同斯大林格勒的“红十月”等工厂的工人和工程技术人员共同研究这些工厂中存在的技术问题，机械学院学生亚洛申科设计的“气体燃料熔铁炉”得到了很高的评价，并为工厂采用。
    苏联高等学校的学生不仅参加企业的技术课题的研究工作，而且还在学校的设计室、实验室、技术车间进行新机器、仪器以及各种设备的设计和制造，并接受工厂订货。例如，列宁格勒的乌里扬诺夫—列宁电工学院的学生就自己制造最新的工具和仪器，他们并接受订货，为列宁格勒国民经济委员会制造一批万能仪器。
    苏联高等学校的学生还想了许多办法，使自己的科学研究工作更切合实际并丰富自己的生产知识。喀山航空学院把学院里的生产实习车间改为制造绘图机械的工厂，在这里由设计、构图到生产，整个过程都由学生自己进行。这所学院还成立了设计处，设计现代化航空体育用具，今后还准备自己制造这些用具。（附图片）
