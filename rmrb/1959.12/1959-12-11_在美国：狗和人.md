A So-Called Free World

    In America: Dogs and People
    In the United States, a country claiming to be the most “affluent” and “civilized” in the Western world, lower animals like dogs live a life of luxury and ease; while millions of people who should enjoy dignity and the right to live lead lives of begging, poverty, and unemployment.
    The United States already had dog restaurants, dog hotels, and other special equipment for dogs. Recently, the "educational problem" of dogs has been put on the agenda of the wealthy. In mid-October, America's first dog school opened in New York, the largest and most luxurious city in the United States. The "Life and Leisure" section of "Newsweek" magazine reported in detail on the dog school under the headline "Further Study". The dogs have their own transportation, a red van, to pick them up and drop them off every day. They carry their own lunch boxes in their mouths. The average tuition is fifty dollars a week. In addition to learning obedience, they also correct the dog's personality, such as shyness and nervousness. The school has class time, as well as breaks and snack time. The dogs are affectionately called "good children" by their masters and teachers.
    However, on the same streets of New York City where these dogs are driven, groups of people live a rather "undignified" life. According to a recent issue of the American magazine "Life": the number of beggars in New York has become a "common fear". The magazine writes about beggars with disgust: in the morning, when people leave home for work and pass through intersections, "professional beggars" swarm up and extend their "extremely dirty" hands, complaining and "narrating their sufferings" to passers-by, and "surround" pedestrians in "broad daylight" until someone coughs up some money.
    In New York, this inverted situation between humans and dogs is not a special case, but a true reflection of American society. According to figures released by the US government: last year, 8% of American families had an annual income of less than $1,000, and 21% of families had an annual income of less than $2,000. As for the unemployed, they are, of course, much more distressed. In August and September of this year, 125,000 unemployed autoworker families were forced to leave Detroit, the center of the American automobile industry, because these families received only 23 US dollars in unemployment relief every two weeks, while the rent, utilities, gas, and food expenses for a family of two cost at least 41.65 US dollars every half a month. American officials admit that many of the children of the American working class are "out of school, in poor health, and living in chicken coops." While the wealthy are extravagant and wasteful, they generously pay what they call "tuition fees" exceeding nearly 30% of the income level of American families for the "further study" of their "good children" -- the dogs -- teaching their "children" the dogs to eat, drink, play, and enjoy themselves more luxuriously, just like them. Look, here again, how disparate the situation is between humans and dogs.
    This is yet another footnote to the so-called "prosperity," "civilization," and "respect for individual dignity" of the "gold dollar empire." (Da Peng)

    在美国：狗和人
    在号称西方世界最“富有”、“文明”的国家——美国，下等动物的狗倒是养尊处优，悠游自在；而千百万应当享有尊严和生活权利的人却过着求乞、贫穷和失业的生活。
    美国原来早就有了狗餐厅和狗旅馆以及其他的狗什么的特别设备了。最近，狗的“教育问题”又被提到阔人们的日程上。10月中旬，美国的第一所狗学校在美国最大的豪华都市纽约开张了。“新闻周刊”的“生活和消遣”栏里，在“进一步学习”的标题下，详细报道了这家狗学校的情况。狗儿们有它们自己的交通车，一辆红色的旅行车，每天接送它们。它们嘴里衔着自己的饭盒。每周学费平均五十美元，除了学习服从以外，还要纠正狗的个性如羞涩、神经质之类。学校有上课时间，也有课间休息和吃点心的时间。狗儿们被它们的主子和教师肉麻地称呼为“好孩子”。
    可是，就在以上这批狗儿们驱车而过的同一个纽约城的街道上，却有着成群的人过着颇不“尊严”的生活。据最近出版的一期美国“生活”杂志报道：纽约乞丐之多，已经成了“共同的恐惧”。这家杂志对乞丐，满怀恶感地写道：早上，当人们离家出外办公，经过十字路口时，“职业乞丐”便群拥而来，伸出他们的“极端污秽”的手，絮絮叨叨地在行人身边“诉苦”，并在“光天化日”之下，把路人“包围”起来，直到有人掏了腰包。
    在纽约，人狗之间这种颠倒的境况，并不是什么特殊情况，而正是美国社会的一个逼真的缩影。根据美国政府发表的数字：去年美国有8％的家庭全年收入不到一千美元，21％的家庭全年收入不到二千美元。至于失业的人，当然要更困苦得多。今年8、9月间就有十二万五千个失业的汽车工人的家庭被迫离开美国汽车业中心底特律，原因是这些家庭每两个星期才领到二十三元美元的失业救济金，而一个两口之家每半个月的房租、水电费、煤气费以及伙食费，最少也得花四十一点六五美元。美国官方承认，美国工人阶级的孩子很多是“失学的，身体很坏，居住在鸡窝里。”阔老们在荒淫挥霍无度之余，为了自己的“好孩子”——狗儿们的“进一步学习”，堂哉皇哉地交出了超过将近30％美国家庭收入水平的所谓“学费”，教他们的“孩子”狗儿们和他们一样学习更豪华地吃、喝、玩、乐。请看，在这里，人和狗的情况又是多么悬殊。
    这是“金元帝国”的所谓“繁荣”、“文明”以及“尊重个人尊严”的又一个注脚。　（大鹏）
