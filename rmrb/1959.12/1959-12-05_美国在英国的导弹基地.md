 U.S. Missile Bases in Britain

 Britain is one of the three countries with the most U.S. military bases (the other two countries are West Germany and Japan). On the small British Isles, there are eighteen U.S. military bases. On February 24, 1958, Britain announced that it had signed an agreement with the United States on the establishment of U.S. missile bases on British territory. The construction of missile bases then began on a large scale. It is reported that at least four missile bases are to be built in an area within a thirty-mile radius of the east coast of England alone. On August 25, 1958, the British Ministry of Defence announced that the first missile base had been completed in Norfolk. Shortly thereafter, U.S. "Thor" intermediate-range missiles were shipped to Britain. (Weng)

    美国在英国的导弹基地
    英国是被美国占有军事基地最多的三个国家之一（另外两个国家是西德和日本）。在小小的英伦三岛上，就有十八个美国军事基地。1958年2月24日，英国宣布它又同美国签订了关于在英国领土上建立美国导弹基地的协定。导弹基地的修筑工程随即大规模地开始。据报道，仅在英格兰东海岸方圆三十英里的一个地区内，至少要修筑四个导弹基地。1958年8月25日，英国国防部宣布第一个导弹基地在诺福克建成。其后不久，美国“雷神式”中程导弹就运到英国。（翁）
