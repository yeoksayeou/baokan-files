Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 14th: The Indonesian News Agency reported yesterday that Indonesian Deputy Minister of Domestic and Foreign Trade Harahap and Deputy Minister of Immigration, Cooperation, and Rural Social Development Achmadi jointly issued regulations on December 12 regarding the takeover of assets of foreign retailers. According to reports, the promulgation of these regulations is to implement Presidential Decree No. 10 concerning the prohibition of foreign retailers from operating in rural areas.

According to reports, according to these regulations, foreign retail stores operating outside of the first- and second-level autonomous regions and state capitals must close no later than January 1, 1960, and the transfer of industries must be carried out before this day.

The regulations define retail "trade stores" as trade shops that sell goods to consumers and purchase goods from small producers for resale to middlemen.

The regulations stipulate that foreign shop owners must invest their funds in institutions designated by the Indonesian authorities to take over their enterprises and "contribute" to these institutions. If they are not prepared to make their funds and abilities available to these institutions, all their remaining goods after January 1, 1960, except for a reasonable amount for household use, must be sold immediately and not be retailed. The regulations also stipulate that committees for determining the amount of compensation should be established in each township and regions with the same status as townships.

    印度尼西亚当局
    发布接管外侨零售商资产条例
    新华社雅加达14日电　印度尼西亚新闻社昨天报道：印度尼西亚国内外贸易部副部长哈拉哈普同移民、合作和乡村社会发展部副部长阿赫马迪12日联合发布了关于接管外侨零售商资产的条例。据报道，颁布这项条例，是为了执行有关禁止乡村地区的外侨零售商营业的第十号总统法令。
    据报道，根据这项条例，在一级和二级自治区和州首府以外营业的外侨零售商店最迟要在1960年1月1日关闭，而产业的转移要在这一天以前进行。
    条例规定了零售“贸易商店”的定义：把商品最后卖给消费者和向小生产者收购商品转售给中间商人的贸易店铺。
    条例规定外侨商店主必须把他们的资金投到印度尼西亚当局指派来接管他们的企业的机构里，并且为这些机构“贡献力量”。如果他们不准备把他们的资金和能力供这些机构利用的话，他们在1960年1月1日以后所有的剩余货物，除了数量合理的家用部分以外，必须立即出售而且不得零售。条例还规定在每个乡以及具有和乡同等地位的地区成立确定补偿数额的委员会。
