    To Be a Shining Candle
    He Xunwu, Qingshan Shuikou Elementary School, Pingxiang, Jiangxi

    I once saw an article in the newspaper criticizing the strange theory that "elementary school teachers are like candles, illuminating others and destroying themselves." I would also like to share my views on this.

    What does it mean to "illuminate others"? And what does it mean to "destroy oneself"? The reasons they give are: after ten or eight years, the students they taught become scientists, poets, or commune cadres, while they themselves remain in an elementary school; they remain in an elementary school with little fame or profit. According to these people, only jobs with high status, high pay, and easy work are glorious and won't destroy oneself. Unfortunately for them, in socialist China, they will not find such unearned work.

    Historically, no one who has illuminated others has destroyed themselves. It is precisely because candles illuminate others that people will never forget them. Dong Cunrui held up a cluster of explosives, illuminating the path to peace and happiness for humanity; Luo Shengjiao ignited the sacred flame of love and plunged into the icy river to save a Korean boy. Although their bodies no longer exist, because they illuminated others, others wrote them into the glorious annals of history. Village teacher Huaerhuana ignited the intelligence of others with her own intellectual fire, so that even in her old age, experts from all over came from afar to celebrate her birthday.

    The "candle theorists" have indeed destroyed themselves; they are not people who illuminate others, but merely broken candles. People call true people's teachers engineers of the human soul. Our teachers should learn from poets and compare their hearts to candles! – Red candle, such a red candle! Poet, spill your heart and compare: is it the same color? – excerpt from Wen Yiduo's "Red Candle Collection."

    做一支发光的腊烛
    江西萍乡青山水口小学　贺逊武
    曾经在报上看到一篇文章，批评那种说“小学教师像支蜡烛，照亮了别人，毁灭了自己”的怪论，我也来说一说自己的看法。
    什么是“照亮了别人”呢？又什么是“毁灭了自己”呢？他们端出的理由是：十年八载之后，自己教出来的学生，某某是科学家啦，某某是诗人啦，某某是公社干部啦，而自己仍然守着一所小学；自己依然守着一所小学名利欠收。按照这些人的打算，只有地位高、报酬多、做起来轻松的工作，才是光荣的不会毁灭自己的工作。然而遗憾得很，在社会主义制度的中国，他们是不可能找到这种不劳而获的工作的。
    历史上没有一个照亮了别人的人，而会毁灭掉他自己的。正因为蜡烛照亮了别人，人们才至今不会忘记它。董存瑞举起了一团炸药，照亮了人类通往和平幸福的道路；罗盛教点燃了人间的神圣爱火，投到冰河之中，救起了一个朝鲜少年。他们的身躯虽然已经不存在了，可是因为他们照亮了别人，别人却把他们写入了光辉的史册。乡村女教师华尔华娜用自己的智火点燃了别人的智火，所以就是到了晚年，各地各色专家不远千里而来，为她庆寿。
    “蜡烛论者”倒的确毁灭了自己，他们不是照亮别人的人，而只是些坏了的蜡烛。人们把真正的人民教师叫做人类灵魂的工程师，我们的教师也要学诗人一样，跟蜡烛去比红心！——红烛呵，这样红的烛！诗人呵，吐出你的心来比比：可是一般颜色？——摘自闻一多“红烛集”
