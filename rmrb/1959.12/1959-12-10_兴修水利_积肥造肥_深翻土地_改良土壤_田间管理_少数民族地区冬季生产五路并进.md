Winter Production Advancing on Five Fronts in Minority Areas

(Reported by our newspaper) On the basis of the consolidation and development of people's communes, farmers of all ethnic groups in minority areas of our country are launching a “five winters” production campaign centered on winter water conservancy construction to prepare for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year.

This year, the scale of water conservancy construction in various minority areas is even larger than in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, at the construction sites of key water conservancy projects stretching over a thousand kilometers north of the Tianshan Mountains, more than 100,000 farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups are braving the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius to dig canals and build reservoirs, intending to divert all the dozens of rivers flowing from the melting snow of the Tianshan Mountains to expand the irrigated area of farmland. This is a magnificent feat by the people's communes of Xinjiang, fully utilizing their superior conditions in terms of manpower and material resources to transform nature. In addition to key water conservancy projects, small-scale water conservancy construction has been widely carried out in various places. The scale of water conservancy construction in the entire region this year is more than double that of last year and the year before. While opening up wasteland and constructing a large number of new water conservancy projects, people of all ethnic groups are gradually carrying out comprehensive reconstruction of the old irrigation areas. People's communes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region finished the autumn harvest half a month earlier than in previous years, freeing up a large number of laborers to invest in winter water conservancy construction as early as possible. The farmers of all ethnic groups fighting on the water conservancy construction sites such as the Yellow River main canal and the West Liao River harnessing project alone completed more than 10 million cubic meters of earth and stone work within a month. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region started water conservancy construction earlier this year than in previous years. In some places, as early as June and July, preparations such as material preparation, road construction, canal excavation, and earth filling began on larger water conservancy projects. In October, water conservancy projects throughout the region were launched one after another, and more than 2,300 large and small water conservancy projects have now started. By November 30, the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province had repaired 122 canals, expanding the irrigated area by more than 39,000 mu, and at the same time renovated more than 2,000 canals that could irrigate more than 600,000 mu of farmland. In the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, which has suffered from drought for many years, the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction is soaring. Moving stories of couples, brothers, fathers and sons, and mothers and daughters vying to participate in water conservancy construction have emerged throughout the prefecture. Farmers in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, who have already freed themselves from the shackles of slavery, have launched a mass movement to dig thousands of pits, ten thousand ponds, and build reservoirs and dams this winter.

In the winter fertilizer accumulation campaign, many minority areas have adopted a method combining professional fertilizer accumulation teams with mass fertilizer accumulation, tapping fertilizer sources from all aspects, resulting in a large quantity and good quality of fertilizer. Due to the large land area and small population, the agricultural areas of Inner Mongolia, which previously accumulated less fertilizer, have launched a high tide of fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing ahead of schedule. Each commune in Aohan Banner organized more than 1,000 professional fertilizer accumulation teams, built more than 20,000 toilets and dug more than 20,000 fertilizer pits within a few days. The land that Zhaowuda League plans to sow next year has an average of nearly 5,000 jin of relatively good quality fertilizer prepared per mu. Ningxia's fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing is progressing quickly and with high quality this year. Overcoming the past phenomenon of “moving yellow soil,” it is promoting advanced experiences such as “one circle and three pits,” “field fertilizer manufacturing,” and “livestock pens going up the mountain” in mountainous areas. More than 115,000 professional fertilizer accumulation teams in the Nanning area of Guangxi are distributed in the mountains, fields, and riversides, adopting methods such as collecting, accumulating, digging, sweeping, and fishing, and have already accumulated more than 120 million dan of fertilizer.

The work of deep plowing and soil improvement in many minority areas has also been grasped earlier and done better than last year. People's communes in Ningxia organized a large number of manpower, livestock, and hundreds of tractors to carry out intensive land plowing day and night. More than 8.9 million mu of the region's 9.6 million mu of summer and autumn stubble land have already been plowed, some even plowed three to four times, with a depth generally around seven to eight inches. While deep plowing, fertilizing, leveling fields, and consolidating land, more than 470,000 mu of farmland has been transformed into small-scale, garden-style fields suitable for mechanized farming, crop rotation, and combined drainage and irrigation. In the Yellow River irrigation area of the Yinchuan Plain, drainage canals have been repaired and newly opened, lowering the groundwater level in low-lying areas, turning tens of thousands of mu of saline-alkali beaches, lakes, and swamps into fertile fields that can be planted with crops next year. By November 27, Guangxi had deep-plowed 14 million mu of land in winter. New agricultural tools were used in deep plowing in various places, and many high-efficiency pacesetters emerged. Xinjiang will transform a large amount of saline-alkali land into fertile fields through this winter's soil improvement work. Uyghur farmers in four counties in the Kashgar area are building large drainage canals and drainage networks to lower the groundwater level and reduce saline-alkali disasters, and are combining various methods such as deep plowing, fertilization, and sand suppression to improve the soil.

Field management of overwintering crops in Guangxi, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and other regions is generally more meticulous than in previous years. Most areas of Guangxi are mobilizing the masses to strengthen field management, determined to achieve "plant one mu, manage one mu well; plant one piece, reap a harvest in one piece." The winter wheat planted in Ningxia is growing well under the careful management of the commune members. In the past, ethnic minority areas in the border regions of Yunnan Province generally did not have the habit of planting small spring crops. After trying to plant small spring crops last year and achieving a bumper harvest, they broke superstitions. This year, they planted 1.75 million mu of small spring crops, and adopted methods such as experimental fields and command fields to drive large-scale high-yield production, changing the past production habit of "plant a slope, harvest a basket."

    兴修水利  积肥造肥  深翻土地  改良土壤 田间管理
    少数民族地区冬季生产五路并进
    本报讯　我国少数民族地区的各族农民，在人民公社巩固发展的基础上，正开展以冬修水利为中心的“五冬”生产运动，为明年农业生产继续跃进作准备。
    今年，各少数民族地区兴修水利的运动，比大跃进的1958年规模还要大。在新疆维吾尔自治区，天山以北迤逦一千多公里的重点水利工程的施工点上，十多万各族农牧民正冒着零下二十多度的严寒，挖水渠、修水库，要把几十条天山融雪的河流全部引下山来，扩大农田灌溉面积。这是新疆人民公社充分利用人力、物力方面的优越条件，改造自然的一项壮举。除了重点水利工程以外，各地还普遍开展了小型水利建设。全区今年水利建设的规模比去年和前年大一倍多，各族人民一面结合开垦荒地兴修大批新的水利工程，一面对旧灌区逐步实行全盘改建。内蒙古自治区的人民公社比往年提前半个月结束秋收秋打，抽出大批劳动力及早投入了冬季水利建设。光是战斗在黄河总干渠、西辽河根治工程等水利工地上的各族农民，一个月内就完成土石方一千多万立方。广西僮族自治区今年的水利建设动手比往年早，有的地方早在6、7月间，就在比较大的水利工地上开始备料、筑路、挖渠道、填土等准备工作。10月份，全区水利工程陆续上马，现在已经动工的大小水利工程有二千三百多处。甘肃临夏回族自治州到11月30日，修渠道一百二十二条，扩大灌溉面积三万九千多亩，同时整修了能灌田六十多万亩的两千多条渠道。历年干旱比较严重的云南红河哈尼族彝族自治州，群众兴修水利的干劲冲天，全州出现了夫妻、兄弟、父子、母女争相投入水利建设的动人事迹。已经摆脱了奴隶枷锁的四川凉山彝族自治州的农民，今冬掀起了一个千坑、万塘、大搞蓄水池和拦水坝的群众性运动。
    在冬季积肥运动中，许多少数民族地区采用了专业队积肥和群众积肥相结合的办法，从各方面挖掘肥源，积肥数量多、质量好。由于地多人少，过去积肥较少的内蒙古农业区，今天提前掀起了积肥造肥高潮。敖汉旗各公社组织了一千多个积肥专业队，几天内修建了两万多个厕所，挖好两万多个积肥坑。昭乌达盟明年计划播种的土地，平均每亩已准备好近五千斤质量比较好的肥料。宁夏今年积肥、造肥进度快、质量高。克服了过去“黄土搬家”的现象，正在推广“一圈三坑”、“田间造肥”和山区的“畜圈上山”等先进经验。广西南宁地区的十一万五千多个积肥专业队，分布在山间、田野、河边，采取采、积、挖、扫、捞等办法，已积肥一亿二千多万担。
    许多少数民族地区的深翻土地和土壤改良工作，也比去年抓得早、作得好。宁夏各人民公社组织大批人力、畜力和数百台拖拉机，日夜突击翻地。全区九百六十万亩夏秋槎地已经翻犁了八百九十多万亩，有的还翻了三遍到四遍，深度一般在七、八寸左右。各地边深翻、边施肥、边平田整地，使四十七万多亩耕地实现了便于机耕、轮作、排灌相结合的大系小畦园田化。在银川平原的黄河灌溉区，整修和新开了排水渠道，降低洼地地下水位，使数万亩碱滩、湖泊和沼泽变成了良田，明年就可以种植作物。到11月27日，广西冬耕深翻的土地已经有一千四百万亩。各地在深耕中使用了新式农具，涌现出不少高工效标兵。新疆经过今冬的改良土壤工作，将有大量盐碱化土地变为良田。喀什专区四个县的维吾尔族农民，正在大修排水渠道和排水网，降低地下水位，减少盐碱灾害，并结合深耕、施肥、压沙等各种办法改良土壤。
    广西、云南、新疆、宁夏等地区越冬作物的田间管理工作，一般比往年细致。广西大部分地区正在发动群众加强田间管理，决心实现“种下一亩，管好一亩；种下一垌，丰收一垌”。宁夏种植的冬小麦，在社员们细心管理下，生长良好。云南边疆少数民族地区过去大都没有种小春作物的习惯，去年试种小春作物获得丰收后，破除了迷信，今年种植小春作物一百七十五万亩，并采用试验田、指挥田等办法，带动大面积高额丰产，改变了过去“种一片坡，收一箩锅”的生产习惯。（附图片）
