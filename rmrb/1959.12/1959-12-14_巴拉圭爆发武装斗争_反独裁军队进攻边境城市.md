Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, December 12th. According to news received today from the Argentine-Paraguayan border, armed personnel opposing the Stroessner dictatorship in Paraguay entered Paraguay in batches from the border area this morning and launched an armed struggle.

News from the Argentine border city of Posadas said that armed personnel opposing the Stroessner dictatorship in Paraguay attacked Encarnación, a border city located 185 miles southeast of the Paraguayan capital Asunción. According to a radio broadcast from the anti-Stroessner forces, the anti-dictatorial army entering Paraguay numbers around 3,000.

According to newspaper reports, a statement issued by the headquarters of the anti-dictatorial forces announced the abolition of the 1940 constitution, which served the dictatorship, and all the persecutory laws enacted under it. The statement condemned the dictator Stroessner and his accomplices as shameless traitors.

According to newspaper reports, this offensive is related to the "May 14th Movement" led by the Paraguayan Liberal Party and the Febrerista Revolutionary Party.

According to the Argentine newspaper "Razón," the Stroessner government has ordered the immediate dispatch of troops to the Paraguayan border with Argentina to carry out suppression. The border adjacent to Argentina and the port of Asunción have been sealed off. Martial law has been declared in all military strongholds in Paraguay.

The Paraguayan people have been under brutal dictatorial rule for twenty years. The Paraguayan military dictatorial group headed by Stroessner came to power through a coup d'état in May 1954 with the support of the United States. Under the influence of the Cuban Revolution, the Paraguayan people's anti-dictatorial struggle has reached an unprecedented height this year.

    巴拉圭爆发武装斗争
    反独裁军队进攻边境城市
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯12日电　据今天从阿根廷和巴拉圭边境收到的消息说，巴拉圭反对斯特罗斯纳独裁政权的武装人员今天早晨从边境地带分批进入巴拉圭，展开武装斗争。
    来自阿根廷边境城市波萨达斯的消息说，巴拉圭反斯特罗斯纳独裁政权的武装人员袭击了位于巴拉圭首都亚松森东南一百八十五英里的边境城市安卡南新。据反斯特罗斯纳独裁政权部队方面的电台广播说，进入巴拉圭的反独裁军队有三千人左右。
    据报纸报道，反独裁政权军队的司令部发表的一项声明宣布：废除1940年的为独裁政权服务的宪法和据此制定的一切迫害性法律。声明谴责独裁者斯特罗斯纳及其走卒们为无耻的卖国贼。
    据报纸报道，这次出击和巴拉圭自由党和二月党领导的“五月十四日运动”有关。
    据阿根廷“理性报”报道，斯特罗斯纳政府已下令立即派军队到巴拉圭同阿根廷的边境去进行镇压。同阿根廷毗邻的边界和亚松森港已被封锁。巴拉圭各军事要塞地区已宣布戒严。
    巴拉圭人民二十年来一直处于残酷的独裁统治下。以斯特罗斯纳为首的巴拉圭军事独裁集团是在美国扶植下，在1954年5月通过发动政变上台的。在古巴革命影响下，今年巴拉圭人民反独裁斗争空前高涨。
