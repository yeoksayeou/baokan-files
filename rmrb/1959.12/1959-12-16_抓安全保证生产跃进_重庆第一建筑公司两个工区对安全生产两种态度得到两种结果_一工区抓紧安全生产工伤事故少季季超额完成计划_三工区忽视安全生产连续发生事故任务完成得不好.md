Grasp Safety to Guarantee Production Leap Forward
Two Work Areas of Chongqing First Construction Company Obtain Two Different Results Due to Two Different Attitudes Towards Safe Production
First Work Area Grasps Safety Production Tightly with Few Work-Related Accidents and Quarterly Over-Fulfilment of Plans
Third Work Area Neglects Safety Production with Continuous Accidents and Poor Completion of Tasks

(By our correspondent) Chongqing – The First Work Area and the Third Work Area of Chongqing First Construction Engineering Company adopted two different attitudes and practices towards safety production, resulting in two different outcomes: the First Work Area carried out in-depth and meticulous safety production work, with fewer work-related accidents, over fulfilling production quotas every quarter, and achieving excellent project quality; the Third Work Area neglected safety production, experienced continuous accidents, and performed poorly in completing production tasks.

The First Work Area has more than two thousand construction workers, with new workers accounting for over 80%. The projects they undertake include factories, schools, hospitals, and guesthouses, with dispersed construction sites and a long front. There are high-altitude and deep-pit operations, as well as both daytime and nighttime construction. All projects are relatively urgent and heavy, which brought difficulties to safe construction. Initially, some cadres and workers did not adequately recognize the complexity of construction and the importance of safety production. Some cadres had a one-sided view of "emphasizing progress over safety," while some workers relied on their "high skills and boldness," neglecting caution during construction. The Party and administrative leaders of the First Work Area took a serious and responsible attitude towards the safety production of workers, fought against various ideas that neglected safety production, and started by mobilizing the masses to clarify their thinking and improve the understanding of safety production among the vast number of cadres and workers. Safety production activities were carried out throughout the entire work area. The majority of workers conducted special discussions on "whether accidents can be avoided," putting forward more than six thousand suggestions and opinions related to safety production. The leadership of the work area improved their work based on the opinions of the masses. Each construction site universally used concrete examples with profound educational significance, and carried out propaganda and education to the masses through blackboards, radio broadcasts, exhibitions, and symposiums. The entire work area also selected seven safe production teams and one hundred and seventy safe producers as examples for workers to learn from.

In order to make safety production a regular practice, under the leadership of the Party General Branch, the work area established a safety production leading group, and each work section established a quality and safety supervision committee. The group also stipulated that from the work area director to the production team leader, they must grasp both production and safety; for important parts of the project and dangerous operations, the quality and safety supervision committee of each work section must formulate safety measures and assign special personnel to be responsible for implementation. All levels of organizations have established necessary rules and regulations related to safety production, and leaders organized workers to hold a safety activity day once a week, conducting regular and irregular safety inspections, and the teams conducted self-inspections and mutual inspections before and after shifts, in order to timely discover unsafe factors, eliminate accident risks, and plug loopholes that could lead to accidents. In order to ensure that various rules and regulations were deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the work area also held various safety education and training classes, organizing foremen, work section chiefs, team leaders, safety officers, and workers who had experienced accidents to learn safety production knowledge and safe operating procedures.

Based on the characteristic of having many new workers, this work area especially strengthened safety education before new workers entered the site and safety education during actual operations. Many work sections and teams also specifically dispatched veteran workers to construction sites with many new workers to provide on-site guidance on safety production.

Through these efforts, the First Work Area rarely had work-related accidents, realizing a double leap forward in production and safety, and becoming one of the best work areas in the entire company in completing tasks.

The production conditions of the Third Work Area this year were in many ways better than those of the First Work Area. The construction tasks were 26.6% less than those of the First Work Area, and the construction site was not large: there were only more than one thousand two hundred workers, most of whom were skilled workers, and new workers accounted for only 30%. However, due to the serious right-leaning ideology of the work area leaders, the safety production situation has been very poor since April.

The leaders of the Third Work Area also paid relatively much attention to safety production in the past. Last year, when they undertook the expansion project of a factory, they concentrated more than five thousand workers, using a cross-立体作业 method of construction day and night. At that time, because the leadership paid close attention to safety production, no major accidents occurred during the tense construction. This year, the tasks were relatively small, and the leaders developed a blind sense of complacency and right-leaning emotions, which also affected ordinary cadres and workers, and many people became numb and careless during construction. When the work area studied production tasks, it rarely studied safety issues. The leadership did not conduct in-depth investigations or carefully formulate safety measures for important construction projects. In July of this year, when the entire company launched a vigorous safety production campaign, the safety production publicity activities in this work area were bleak. Some workers in two teams have always failed to pay attention to safety production, and there have been many accidents, but the leadership has not seriously carried out education. As a result, since April, this work area has experienced three major accidents in a row. According to on-site inspections by relevant departments after the event, these major accidents could have been avoided if they had been prevented before they occurred. In August, September, and October, when there were many accidents, production was also affected, and only 71% of the monthly plan was completed in October.

Chongqing First Construction Company recently held a comparative on-site meeting on safety production, and seriously summarized their experiences and lessons. Now, the Third Work Area has taken measures in many aspects to strengthen safety work.

    抓安全保证生产跃进
    重庆第一建筑公司两个工区对安全生产两种态度得到两种结果
    一工区抓紧安全生产工伤事故少季季超额完成计划
    三工区忽视安全生产连续发生事故任务完成得不好
    本报讯　重庆市第一建筑工程公司的第一工区和第三工区，采取两种不同的态度和不同的作法对待安全生产，产生了两个不同的结果：第一工区安全生产工作做得深入、细致、工伤事故少，生产季季超额，工程质量优良；第三工区忽视安全生产，连续发生事故，生产任务完成得不好。
    第一工区有二千多名建筑工人，新工人占80％以上。他们承建的工程有厂房、校舍、医院、招待所，工地分散，战线长。有高空、深坑作业；有白天施工，也有夜间施工。工程都比较紧迫、繁重。这些都给安全施工带来了困难。开始，部分干部和工人对施工的复杂性和安全生产的重要性认识不足，有的干部存在着“重进度轻安全”的片面观点，有的工人自恃“艺高人胆大”，在施工中疏忽大意。第一工区的党和行政领导人员用认真严肃的态度对待工人的安全生产问题，同各种忽视安全生产的思想进行了斗争，从发动群众辩通思想，提高广大干部和工人对安全生产的认识着手，在全工区开展了安全生产的活动。广大工人进行了“事故能不能避免”的专题鸣放，提出了六千多条有关安全生产的建议和意见，工区领导方面根据群众意见改进了工作。各工地普遍运用有深刻教育意义的具体事例，通过黑板报、广播、展览会、座谈会向群众进行了宣传教育。全工区还评选出七个安全小组，一百七十名安全生产者，作为工人学习的榜样。
    为了使安全生产经常化，在党总支领导下，工区成立了安全生产领导小组，各工段成立了质量安全监督委员会，小组设立了安全员。他们还规定：从工区主任到生产组长，既要抓生产，又要抓安全；对工程重要部位、危险作业，各工段的质量安全监督委员会都要订立安全措施，指定专人负责贯彻。各级组织都建立了必要的有关安全生产的规章制度，领导工人一周举行一次安全活动日，定期和不定期地进行安全检查，小组在班前班后进行自检互检，以便及时发现不安全的因素，拔掉事故苗子，堵塞发生事故的漏洞。为了使各种规章制度深入人心，工区还开办了各种安全教育训练班，组织工长、工段长、小组长、安全员和出事故多的工人学习安全生产知识和安全操作规程。
    根据新工人多的特点，这个工区特别加强了新工人入场前的安全教育和实际操作中的安全教育。许多工段和小组还专门抽出老工人到新工人多的工地，进行现场安全生产的指导。
    经过这些努力，第一工区很少发生工伤事故，实现了生产、安全双跃进，成为全公司完成任务最好的工区之一。
    第三工区今年的生产条件在不少方面比第一工区还好。建筑任务比第一工区少26.6％，工地现场不大：工人只有一千二百多名，大部分是技术工人，新工人只占30％。但是由于工区领导人员思想上存在着严重的右倾思想，4月份以来安全生产的情况一直很差。
    第三工区的领导人员过去对安全生产也比较重视。去年，他们在承建一个工厂的扩建工程时，曾经集中五千多名工人，白天黑夜用交叉立体作业的方法施工。当时，由于领导方面对安全生产抓得紧，在紧张的施工中没有发生重大事故。今年任务比较小，领导人员滋长了盲目自满思想和右倾情绪，也影响了一般干部和工人，许多人在施工中麻痹大意。工区研究生产任务时，很少研究安全问题。领导方面对重要施工项目，也不深入调查，周密细致地订出安全措施。今年7月间，全公司开展轰轰烈烈的安全生产运动时，这个工区的安全生产宣传活动却冷冷清清。有两个小组的部分工人一直不重视安全生产，事故很多，领导方面也不认真进行教育。结果，自4月份以来，这个工区连续发生了三次重大事故，据有关部门事后现场检查，如果防范于未然，这几次重大事故都是可以避免的。在事故多的8、9、10月份，生产也受到了影响，10月份只完成月计划的71％。
    重庆市第一建筑公司最近召开了安全生产对比现场会，认真总结了他们的经验教训。现在，第三工区已经从多方面采取措施，加强了安全工作。
