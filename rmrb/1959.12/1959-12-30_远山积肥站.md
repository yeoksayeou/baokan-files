The Yanwan Production Brigade of the Shuangjing People's Commune in Guyuan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is located in a mountainous area. Based on the high mountains and remote lands, this brigade decided to establish twenty-five yuanshan (remote mountain) manure accumulation stations to herd sheep to the mountains for grazing and accumulate manure on the spot. Nine manure accumulation stations have now been built, accumulating more than 2.7 million jin of fertilizer.

After the establishment of the yuanshan manure accumulation stations, the entire brigade can save 821 man-days and more than 1,200 animal labor days for transporting fertilizer. The environmental sanitation of the village has also been improved.

　　远山积肥站
    宁夏回族自治区固原县双井人民公社严湾生产大队位于山区，这个队根据山高地远的情况，决定建立二十五处远山积肥站，把羊赶到山上放牧，就地积肥。现已修好积肥站九处，积肥料二百七十多万斤。
    建立远山积肥站以后，全大队可节省运肥的人力八百二十一个、畜力一千二百多个。村里的环境卫生也得到改善。
