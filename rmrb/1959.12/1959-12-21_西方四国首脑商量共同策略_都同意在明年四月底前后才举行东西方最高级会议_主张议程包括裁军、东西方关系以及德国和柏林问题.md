Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 19th: The three-day Western four-power heads of government meeting began this morning at the Élysée Palace, the French presidential residence. Attending the meeting were U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, French President Charles de Gaulle, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, as well as French Prime Minister Michel Debré and the foreign ministers of the four countries. It is understood that the purpose of this meeting is to determine the West's common stance at the East-West summit and to seek to reconcile differences of opinion among themselves.

　　At today's meeting, the time, place, and agenda of the East-West summit were mainly discussed.

　　According to U.S. government spokesman James Hagerty, the four countries had proposed different dates for the East-West summit, but at the meeting "everyone agreed to hold it near the end of April."

　　Regarding the location of the East-West summit, Western reporters here speculate that the meeting tends to favor holding it in Geneva.

　　Regarding the participants of the East-West summit, U.S. spokesman William J. Burdett stated that the West advocates limiting it to the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. Burdett and West German spokesman Felix von Eckardt both announced that Adenauer had stated that West Germany was unwilling to participate in the East-West summit. Eckardt also said that his government had no desire to participate in the East-West summit, not even to sit in the same room while the meeting was in progress. West Germany's adoption of this stubborn and ridiculous attitude is an attempt to prevent representatives of the German Democratic Republic from participating in the meeting.

　　According to a British spokesman, the meeting has agreed that the agenda of the East-West summit should include three items: disarmament, the German and Berlin questions, and East-West relations.

　　News from the meeting said that on the issue of disarmament, the Western four countries believe that the disarmament plan must be linked to the political settlement between East and West. Regarding the West Berlin issue, the meeting participants emphasized that the West Berlin issue should be discussed and resolved in conjunction with the German question. Western reporters pointed out that the Western countries have in fact agreed to use the "package plan" proposed by the West at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference as the basis for negotiations with the Soviet Union, believing that "this means that the attitude of the Allies has become tougher." West German spokesman Eckardt stated that Adenauer was "very satisfied" with this.

　　The meeting has instructed the foreign ministers of the four countries to draft documents to be submitted to the Soviet Union regarding the holding of the East-West summit, and to submit them to tomorrow's meeting for discussion and decision.

　　U.S. spokesman Burdett said that the Western four countries are studying whether to hold another Western summit or foreign ministers' meeting before the East-West summit.

　　After the meeting, which lasted more than two hours this morning, U.S. President Eisenhower held a one-hour private meeting with French President de Gaulle. Because the U.S. and France had a fierce dispute over the issue of military "integration" at the recently concluded North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, and France was greatly dissatisfied with the U.S. abstention in the United Nations General Assembly vote on Pakistan's proposal on the Algerian question, this meeting attracted attention from all sides. After the meeting, White House spokesman Hagerty acknowledged that they discussed the issues that everyone thought might be discussed, "mainly" the "U.S. abstention in the vote on the Algerian question at the United Nations and the issue of North Atlantic Treaty Organization integration (unified leadership)." American reporters emphasized that Eisenhower adopted a "firm and clear" attitude in the meeting, demanding that de Gaulle make concessions and not oppose handing over the French army to the unified command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, de Gaulle refused to agree. De Gaulle reiterated France's demand to enjoy "equal status" with the U.S. and Britain in the Western camp. On the Algerian issue, it is said that de Gaulle was "greatly displeased" with the U.S. abstention during the vote at the United Nations General Assembly.

　　In explaining, Eisenhower stated that the U.S. would continue to support the "de Gaulle Plan" and said that the U.S. originally opposed the United Nations General Assembly passing any proposals on the Algerian question. But he also said that the U.S. attitude at the United Nations General Assembly was irreproachable. "France-Soir" commented that the U.S.-French meeting began in a "difficult atmosphere" and that U.S.-French relations were "much colder" than when Eisenhower visited Paris in September.

　　It is reported that Eisenhower and de Gaulle will hold another private meeting.

### 西方四国首脑商量共同策略  都同意在明年四月底前后才举行东西方最高级会议  主张议程包括裁军、东西方关系以及德国和柏林问题

　　西方四国首脑商量共同策略
    都同意在明年四月底前后才举行东西方最高级会议
    主张议程包括裁军、东西方关系以及德国和柏林问题
    新华社巴黎19日电　预定开三天的西方四国政府首脑会议今天上午在法国总统府爱丽舍宫开始举行。参加会议的是美国总统艾森豪威尔、英国首相麦克米伦、法国总统戴高乐、西德总理阿登纳以及法国总理德勃雷和四国的外长。据悉，这次会议的目的是为了商定西方在东西方最高级会议上的共同态度，同时谋求调和相互之间的意见分歧。
    在今天的会议上主要讨论了东西方最高级会议的时间、地点和议程问题。
    据美国政府发言人哈格蒂说，四国对东西方最高级会议曾经提出了不同的日期，但是会上“每个人都同意在接近4月底举行”。
    关于东西方最高级会议的地点，此间西方记者传说，会议倾向于主张在日内瓦举行。
    关于东西方最高级会议的参加者，据美国发言人伯丁表示，西方主张只限于苏美英法四国。伯丁和西德发言人埃卡特都宣布，阿登纳已经表示西德不愿意参加东西方最高级会议。埃卡特还说，他的政府丝毫也不想参加东西方最高级会议，那怕是在会议进行时坐在同一个房间里。西德采取这种顽固而可笑的态度，是企图不让德意志民主共和国的代表参加会议。
    据英国发言人说，会议已经商定，认为东西方最高级会议的议程应包括三项：裁军问题、德国和柏林问题以及东西方关系问题。
    从会议传出来的消息说，在裁军问题上，西方四国认为裁军计划必须同东西方的政治解决联系起来。关于西柏林问题，会议参加者强调西柏林问题要和德国问题联系在一起讨论和解决。西方记者指出，西方国家实际上已同意以西方在日内瓦外长会议上提出的“一揽子计划”作为同苏联谈判的基础，认为“这意味着盟国的态度已变得强硬了”。西德发言人埃卡特表示，阿登纳对这一点“十分满意”。
    会议已责成四国外长草拟它们将向苏联提出的关于举行东西方首脑会议的文件，提交明日会议讨论决定。
    美国发言人伯丁说，西方四国正在研究在东西方最高级会议之前再举行一次西方最高级会议或外长会议。
    在今天上午开了两小时多的会议结束后，美国总统艾森豪威尔同法国总统戴高乐进行了一小时单独的会谈。由于美法两国在刚结束的北大西洋集团理事会会议上对军事“一体化”问题发生了激烈的争吵，以及法国对美国在联合国大会表决巴基斯坦关于阿尔及利亚问题的提案时弃权大为不满，这次会谈引起了各方面的注意。会谈后，白宫发言人哈格蒂承认，他们讨论了大家认为可能讨论的问题，“主要”是“美国在联合国就阿尔及利亚问题投票时弃权以及北大西洋公约组织一体化（统一领导）的问题”。美国记者强调说，艾森豪威尔在会谈中采取了“坚决和明确”的态度，要求戴高乐作出让步，不要反对把法国军队交给北大西洋公约组织统一指挥。但是戴高乐拒绝同意。戴高乐重申法国在西方阵营要同美、英两国享有“平等地位”的要求。在阿尔及利亚问题上，据说戴高乐对美国在联合国大会表决时弃权“大为不悦”。
    艾森豪威尔在解释时表示美国将继续支持“戴高乐计划”，并且说美国本来反对联合国大会就阿尔及利亚问题通过任何提案。但是他又表示，美国在联合国大会上的态度是无可指责的。“法兰西晚报”的评论说，这次美法会谈是在“困难的气氛”中开始的，美法关系比艾森豪威尔9月访问巴黎时“大为冷淡”了。
    有消息说，艾森豪威尔和戴高乐还要再举行单独会谈。
