　　Dangshan and Dianjiang Grain Yield Exceeds 1,000 Jin
    Dangshan County's Total Grain Output Nearly Doubles Compared to 1958
    Dianjiang County Creates a Miracle of Achieving Extraordinary Harvests in a Heavily Afflicted Area
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Huaibei Dangshan County in Anhui Province has surpassed the 1,000-jin mark in grain production. The county's 693,613 mu of grain crops averaged 1,002 jin per mu, a 71.28% increase compared to the bumper year of 1958. Due to the expansion of planting area, the total grain output of the county has nearly doubled compared to 1958.
    Comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and resolutely implementing the policy of "both multiple planting for more yield and high yield for more yield" are crucial keys to achieving the goal of becoming a 1,000-jin county. In the spring planting, the county not only focused on the main grains but also on minor grains. At the beginning of spring planting, in addition to making full use of vacant land to expand the planting area, it also actively expanded the multiple cropping area and comprehensively carried out intercropping and relay intercropping. Over 310,000 mu of cotton were intercropped with peanuts and sweet potatoes, and over 360,000 mu of sweet potatoes were intercropped with kohlrabi or corn wherever possible. According to statistics, the county had 93,475 mu of intercropped and relay intercropped land and reclaimed 57,932 mu of wasteland. The grain obtained from these two items alone almost completed the overproduction plan.
    While vigorously pursuing multiple planting for more yield, the county party committee also paid special attention to high-yield crops such as rice and sweet potatoes. This year, the rice planting area was 1.9 times larger than last year, and the sweet potato planting area was 66,151 mu larger than last year. At the same time, a large-scale high-yield campaign was widely carried out, resulting in large-scale continuous rice harvests and large-area high-yield sweet potatoes. The county had 23,149 mu of sweet potatoes with yields exceeding 10,000 jin per mu. The increased sweet potato and rice planting alone yielded more than 72 million jin of grain (the sweet potato yield is calculated by converting it to main grain).
    According to Xinhua News Agency, under the leadership of the Party and relying on the power of the people's communes, the people of Dianjiang County, Sichuan Province, overcame the extraordinary drought and created a miracle of achieving an extraordinary leap forward and becoming a 1,000-jin county in a heavily afflicted area. The county's 750,000+ mu of grain crops averaged 1,204 jin per mu, a 35.4% increase compared to last year.
    From June to mid-September this year, Dianjiang County had virtually no rain for more than 80 consecutive days. The drought-affected area of ​​the county's 560,000 mu of major spring crops reached more than 80%, and in many places, rivers dried up and the soil cracked. More than 110,000 mu of mid-season rice, corn, and sweet potatoes alone were killed by the drought. Major spring grain crops account for the vast majority of the annual grain output, and whether or not the disaster can be overcome is the key to whether or not the entire county can achieve a bumper harvest this year. Party organizations at all levels in the county led the masses in launching a vigorous anti-drought struggle. The broad masses tried every possible means to draw water, bail water, lift water by waterwheels, carry water, draw water, release water, and dig underground water to irrigate the fields. In more than 80 days, the county built more than 110,000 dikes, dug underground water sources, and sank wells, providing two to four irrigations to the major spring crops. In conjunction with protecting seedlings and saving seedlings, topdressing and weeding were generally carried out, and field management was strengthened.
    Dianjiang County has a mild climate and a long growing season for crops. In order to make up for the losses caused by the disaster, the people of the county, with increased planting as the center, vigorously promoted replanting, changing planting, intercropping, relay intercropping, and expanding the area of ​​late autumn crops, striving for multiple planting for more yield. The commune members put forward the slogan "If one mu dies from drought, reclaim two mu," not only rushing to plant late rice, sweet potatoes, and late autumn crops on time, but also planting all the land that could be planted. The area of ​​sweet potatoes, potatoes, buckwheat, radishes, and other miscellaneous grains that were rushed to plant and replant in the county reached 420,000 mu. As a result of the harvest, sweet potatoes, buckwheat, and potatoes alone accounted for 16.4% of the county's total grain output.

### 砀山垫江粮食单产超千斤  砀山县粮食总产量比1958年增长近一倍  垫江县创造重灾区夺得特大丰收的奇迹

　　砀山垫江粮食单产超千斤
    砀山县粮食总产量比1958年增长近一倍
    垫江县创造重灾区夺得特大丰收的奇迹
    据新华社讯　安徽省淮北砀山县粮食生产越过千斤关。全县六十九万三千六百一十三亩粮食作物，平均亩产一千零二斤，比大丰收的1958年增长了71.28％；由于播种面积扩大，粮食总产量比1958年增长将近一倍。
    全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”，坚决执行“多种多收和高产多收同时并举”的方针，是实现粮食千斤县的重要关键。在春种中，这个县不仅抓好了主粮，而且也抓好了小杂粮。春种开始，除充分利用空隙地扩大种植面积外，还积极扩大复种面积，全面开展间作套种。三十一万多亩棉花全部间种了花生、甘薯，三十六万多亩甘薯能间种的都种了大头菜或玉米。据统计，全县间作复种的有九万三千四百七十五亩，开荒五万七千九百三十二亩，仅这两项多收的粮食就接近完成超产计划。
    在大抓多种多收的同时，县委还特别重视水稻和甘薯等高产作物。今年水稻比去年扩大一点九倍；甘薯比去年多种六万六千一百五十一亩；同时广泛开展大面积丰产运动，获得水稻连片大丰收，甘薯大面积高产，全县亩产万斤以上的甘薯就有二万三千一百四十九亩。仅今年扩大的甘薯和水稻就多收粮食七千二百多万斤（其中的甘薯产量，是折合主粮计算的）。
    据新华社讯　四川省垫江县人民今年在党的领导下，依靠人民公社的威力，战胜了特大干旱，创造了重灾县获得特大跃进，并一举成为粮食千斤县。全县七十五万多亩粮食作物，平均亩产一千二百零四斤，比去年增产35.4％。
    从今年6月到9月中旬，垫江县连续八十多天基本未下过雨。全县五十六万亩大春作物受旱面积达80％以上，许多地方河水断流，田土龟裂。仅中稻、玉米、红苕等作物旱死达十一万多亩。大春粮食作物占全年粮食产量的绝大部分，能否战胜灾害是今年全县能否丰收的关键。全县各级党组织领导群众展开了轰轰烈烈的抗旱斗争。广大群众千方百计地采取抽水、戽水、车水、挑水、提水、放水、挖地下水等办法，引水灌田。八十多天中，全县扎河堰、挖地下水、打井等达十一万多处，给大春作物普遍浇灌了二到四次。结合保苗救苗，普遍进行追肥和锄草，加强了田间管理。
    垫江县气候温和，作物生长期长。为了弥补灾害带来的损失，全县人民以增种为中心，大抓补种、改种、间种、套种和扩大晚秋作物面积，力争多种多收。社员们提出“旱死一亩，夺回两亩”的口号，不仅把晚稻、红苕、晚秋作物按时抢种下去，而且把一切能种的土地都种上。全县抢种、补种的红苕、洋芋、荞麦、萝卜和其它杂粮的面积就达到四十二万亩。收获结果，仅红苕、荞麦、洋芋三项就占全县粮食产量的16.4％。
