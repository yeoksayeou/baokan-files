    Schiller's Masterpiece
    To commemorate the bicentennial of Schiller's birth, the China Youth Art Theater performed the play "Intrigue and Love," a masterpiece by the great 18th-century German poet and playwright Schiller.
    The play, through the love tragedy of Ferdinand, the major son of Duke's Prime Minister Walter, and Louise, the daughter of musician Miller, depicts the conflict between the court aristocratic class and the petty-bourgeois class, reflecting the struggle between the emerging bourgeois democratic ideas and the increasingly declining feudalism in Germany at that time. Engels gave a high evaluation of this script, saying that the main value of Schiller's "Intrigue and Love" lies in the fact that it is the first German political tendency play.
    The play performed by the China Youth Art Theater better embodies the progressive thought of this great poet and playwright, and also truly reproduces the characters portrayed in the play and the era it depicts.

    席勒名作
    中国青年艺术剧院为了纪念席勒诞生二百周年演出了话剧“阴谋与爱情”，这是德国十八世纪伟大的诗人、剧作家席勒的名作。
    这个剧是通过公爵的宰相瓦尔特的儿子裴迪南少校和乐师米勒的女儿路易斯的恋爱悲剧，写宫庭贵族阶级和小市民阶级的冲突，反映了当时德国新兴资产阶级民主思想和日益没落的封建主义的斗争。恩格斯曾对这个剧本给予很高的评价，他说：席勒的“阴谋与爱情”的主要价值就在于它是第一部德国政治倾向的剧本。
    青艺演出的这个剧，较好地体现了这位伟大诗人、剧作家的进步思想，也真实地再现了剧中所刻划的人物形象和所描绘的时代面貌。
