　　With Ambition, One Can Soar High; Strive for a Good Start
　　Yao Guoxiang, Welder at Shanghai Shipyard
    There is an old Chinese saying: "People strive to go higher, with ambition, one can soar high." We should have this ambition and advance bravely with the spirit of continuous revolution. That is to say, after completing one target, we should think about completing higher, newer targets. Our factory will soon build the second 3,000-ton ocean-going vessel, and the construction cycle on the slipway must be shorter than the thirty-five-day record created last year. This is a very glorious and very arduous task. Judging from the situation of our welding workshop, most of the workers are young technicians and apprentices. It is not without difficulties to complete this glorious task in such a short period of time. But none of us were intimidated by the difficulties. On the contrary, we were even more motivated, thumping our chests and saying: "Our workers have great enthusiasm, the heavier the task, the more satisfied we are. We will grow innovative wings and tap potential to make another leap forward!" We made up our minds and also arranged a battle plan. First of all, we concentrated our efforts on tapping the potential of machinery and equipment, vigorously carried out technological innovation, and greatly improved production efficiency. In order to adapt to the needs of new production, we learned from experienced master workers and technical books, and at the same time went to other factories to "seek treasures and learn lessons," so as to quickly master and improve technical levels, so that the existing ten people who can operate independently increased to twenty-six, so that everyone can stand alone and each one can be an advanced soldier in the leap forward.
    The battle horn of 1960 has already sounded. We have made all preparations, determined to achieve a good start in this year's production, strive to achieve monthly red, and climb to new peaks of the leap forward! (Reported by Baoshan)

　　有志能高飞  力争开门红
　　上海船厂电焊工　姚国祥
    中国有句老话：“人往高处走，有志能高飞。”我们应该有这种志气，用不断革命的精神奋勇前进。也就是说，完成了一个指标，就应该想到完成更高的新的指标。我厂很快就要建造第二艘三千吨海轮，船台周期比去年创造的三十五天纪录，还要缩短。这是一件十分光荣而又十分艰巨的任务。从我们电焊工段的情况看，大部分是青年技工和学徒工，要在这样短的时间内完成这个光荣的任务，不是没有困难的。但我们谁也没被困难吓倒，相反地，更加鼓足了干劲，猛拍胸脯说：“咱们工人有干劲，任务越重越称心，长上革新大翅膀，挖掘潜力再跃进！”我们下了决心，也安排了作战计划。首先我们集中力量，从挖掘机具潜力着手，大搞技术革新，大大提高生产效率。为了适应新的生产的需要，我们一方面向有经验的老师傅学习，向技术书本学习，同时到外厂去“取经觅宝”，从而迅速掌握和提高技术水平，使现有能单独操作的十个人增加到二十六个，做到人人能独挡一面，个个做跃进尖兵。
    1960年的战斗号角已经吹响了，我们已作好一切准备，立志做到今年生产开门红，力争实现月月红，攀登跃进新高峰！（宝山记）
