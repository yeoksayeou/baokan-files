Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 24th: The eight minority-inhabited counties of Sanjiang, Damaoshan, Longsheng, Yishan, Huanjiang, Ningming, Jingxi, and Mubian, which won the first prize for grain production in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1958, have continued to make leaps forward in grain production this year, catching up with the advanced levels of the Han areas in Guangxi.

These eight counties are distributed in the remote mountainous areas of northern and southwestern Guangxi. In the past, grain yields were very low. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, grain production surged, with total output increasing by 50% to 100% compared to 1957, transforming them from grain-deficient counties to surplus-grain counties. This year, on the basis of last year, the total grain output of these eight counties has increased by another 20% to 50%, and Longsheng and Mubian have emerged as two "thousand-jin counties." In Ningming County, the average grain per person in 1957 was 577 jin. This year, the population has increased by more than 8,000 compared to two years ago, and the average grain per person is 1,627 jin.

Adhering to putting politics in command and constantly opposing various right-leaning conservative ideas are the fundamental keys to the sustained leap forward in these eight counties. In 1958, the county committees of the Chinese Communist Party in these counties fully mobilized the masses and powerfully criticized the "backwardness theory" and "special theory" in minority areas, thereby liberating the minds of the people of all ethnic groups and establishing a bold and daring style and lofty aspirations. This year, these counties have continued to criticize new right-leaning ideological sentiments. For example, Mubian County criticized the "peak production theory," further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses.

In the past two years, people of all ethnic groups have also reformed some outdated customs and bad habits that have hindered production for thousands of years. After raising their ideological awareness, the people of the ethnic minorities in the two autonomous counties of Sanjiang and Longsheng abolished all "taboo days," "forbidden days," and "ghost days" that prevented them from working, adding a total of 5.74 million workdays per year, universally promoted the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, and changed backward production methods such as slash-and-burn cultivation.

Learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and launching mass movements are another basic experience for increasing grain production. Since the beginning of this year, Longsheng Various Nationalities Autonomous County has conducted four county-wide general inspections and appraisals, promptly promoting advanced experiences, planting red flags, and establishing pace-setters. Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County not only carried out competitions between communes, teams, and individuals within the county, but also linked up with 32 counties, including Longsheng, Damaoshan, and Chaoan County in Guangdong Province, to carry out labor competitions.

Simultaneous development of industry and agriculture and comprehensive development of the five industries have directly supported grain production. These counties generally have abundant timber and rich local specialties. While developing grain production, they have paid attention to diversified operations, so that various productions such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have been rapidly developed. The great development of sideline production not only increased the income of communes and members, but also expanded land investment. For example, in Longsheng County, the income from sideline production last year averaged 95 yuan per household. The communes and brigades all took out a portion of their income to purchase large quantities of production materials and chemical fertilizers and invested them in agricultural production. At the same time, the counties, communes, and brigades have also set up some factories according to production needs and resource conditions, which have played a great role in supporting agriculture. For example, Munan Commune in Ningming County used the funds accumulated by the commune to set up factories for agricultural tools and indigenous chemical fertilizers. The fertilizer factory produced 140,000 jin of indigenous chemical fertilizer in half a year; the agricultural tool factory produced 2,893 large and small agricultural tools and transportation tools, which timely supported agricultural production and guaranteed a bumper harvest of grain.

The fact that eight minority-inhabited counties have developed at high speed vividly demonstrates the superiority of the people's communes. Most of these counties are located in high and cold mountainous areas, with high mountains and long roads, small and scattered plots of land, inconvenient transportation, and a prominent problem of insufficient labor. After communization, this problem was basically solved. For example, Napo Commune in Mubian County eliminated more than 3,700 mu of interspersed fields when adjusting the cultivated areas, turning remote fields into nearby fields, and built three highways and three avenues, overcoming the difficulties of high mountains and long roads. In particular, the universal establishment of public canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries freed thousands of women laborers from trivial housework and allowed them to participate in major labor, becoming a vital force in agricultural production.

　　广西八个少数民族聚居县
    粮食生产跃上先进水平
    总产量比去年增长二至五成，龙胜、睦边已成千斤县
    据新华社南宁24日电　荣获1958年广西僮族自治区粮食生产头等奖的三江、大苗山、龙胜、宜山、环江、宁明、靖西、睦边八个少数民族聚居的县，今年粮食生产继续跃进，已经赶上广西汉族地区的先进水平。
    这八个县分布在广西的北部和西南部的边远山区，过去粮食产量很低，在1958年大跃进中，粮食产量突飞猛进，总产量分别比1957年增长50％至一倍，由缺粮县变为余粮县，今年，这八个县在去年的基础上，粮食总产量又分别增产两成至五成，并且出现龙胜、睦边两个千斤县。宁明县1957年平均每人五百七十七斤粮，今年人口比两年前增加了八千多人，而平均每人有粮一千六百二十七斤。
    坚持政治挂帅，不断地反对各种右倾保守思想，是这八个县获得持续跃进的根本关键。1958年这些县的中共县委曾充分发动群众，有力地批判了少数民族地区“落后论”、“特殊论”，从而使各族人民解放了思想，树立敢想敢干的风格和雄心大志。今年，这些县又继续批判了新的右倾思想情绪。如睦边县批判了“增产到顶论”，进一步调动了广大群众的积极性。
    两年来，各少数民族人民还改革了千百年妨碍生产的一些陈规陋习。三江、龙胜两个自治县的少数民族人民在提高思想觉悟以后，把不能出工的“忌日”、“禁日”、“鬼日”等全部废除，一年共增加五百七十四万个劳动日，普遍推行了农业生产“八字宪法”，改变了刀耕火种等落后的生产方式。
    学先进、赶先进、大搞群众运动，是粮食增产的另一个基本经验。龙胜各族自治县今年以来，进行了四次全县性的大检查、大评比，及时地推广先进经验，插红旗，树标兵。三江侗族自治县不仅在县内开展公社与公社、队与队、人与人之间的竞赛运动，同时和龙胜、大苗山以及广东省的潮安县等三十二个县挂钩，开展劳动竞赛。
    工农业并举，五业全面大发展，直接支援了粮食生产。这些县一般木材茂盛，土特产丰富，在发展粮食生产的同时，都注意了多种经营、使林、牧、副、渔等各种生产都得到了迅速发展。副业生产大发展，不仅使公社和社员的收入增加，而且扩大了土地投资。如龙胜县去年副业生产收入，平均每户达九十五元，各公社和大队都拿出一部分收入购买大批的生产资料和化肥，投入了农业生产。同时，各县、公社、大队又根据生产的需要和资源条件，举办一些工厂，对支援农业也起了很大的作用。如宁明县的睦南公社利用公社积累的资金，办起农具、土化肥等工厂，化肥厂建厂半年，就生产十四万斤土化肥；农具厂造出了二千八百九十三架大小农具和运输工具，及时地支援了农业生产，保证了粮食的大丰收。
    八个少数民族聚居县生产高速度发展的事实，生动地显示了人民公社的优越性。这些县大都处于高寒山区，山高路远，田块小而分散，交通不便，劳动力不足是个突出的问题。公社化以后，这个问题得到了基本解决。如睦边县那坡公社在调整耕作区时，消灭了三千七百多亩插花田，变远田为近田，并且修了三条公路和三条大道，克服了山高路远生产不便的困难。特别是普遍建立公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所，把数以千计的妇女劳动力从琐碎的家务中解放出来，参加了主要劳动，成了农业生产上的一支生力军。
