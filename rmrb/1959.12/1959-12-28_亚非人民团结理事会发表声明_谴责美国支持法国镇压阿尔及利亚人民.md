Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 26th - Youssef el-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, read out a statement at a press conference today, condemning the United States' position on the Algerian issue at the United Nations General Assembly and "expressing regret for its support of French imperialism."

The statement pointed out that the United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, rejected the proposals of Asian and African countries on the Algerian issue, which did not bring prestige to the United Nations. The statement went on to say that in order to prevent the Asian-African proposal from obtaining a two-thirds majority, the vote of the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan was used.

In its statement, the Secretariat expressed regret that some Asian and African countries, under the pressure of the United States, did not support Algeria when the Algerian issue was discussed at the United Nations General Assembly.

The statement said that by supporting Algeria, the people of Asia and Africa are not only supporting a country fighting for freedom and independence, but also supporting the struggle of all other countries fighting to regain their deprived rights, especially African countries.

Finally, the Secretariat called on the people of Asia and Africa to express their strong anger at the position taken by the United Nations and the attitude of some Asian and African countries that disregarded Algeria. It also called on the people of those countries to do everything in their power to change their governments' attitude towards Algeria.

　　亚非人民团结理事会发表声明
    谴责美国支持法国镇压阿尔及利亚人民
    新华社开罗26日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处总书记优素福·西巴伊今天在记者招待会上宣读一项声明，谴责美国在联合国大会上对阿尔及利亚问题所采取的立场，并且“对它支持法国帝国主义的做法表示遗憾”。
    声明指出，联合国在美国操纵下拒绝亚非国家关于阿尔及利亚问题的提案的做法，没有给联合国带来声望。声明接着说，为了阻止亚非提案获得三分之二的多数，竟利用了台湾蒋介石集团的一票。
    书记处在声明中对一些亚非国家在美国的压力下，在联合国大会上讨论阿尔及利亚问题时没有支持阿尔及利亚一事表示遗憾。
    声明说，通过支持阿尔及利亚，亚非各国人民不仅是在支持一个为自由和独立而斗争的国家，而且也是在支持为重新获得自己被剥夺的权利而奋斗的所有其他国家、特别是非洲国家的斗争。
    书记处最后呼吁亚非各国人民对联合国采取的立场以及不顾阿尔及利亚的一些亚非国家的态度表示他们强烈的愤怒。并且还要求那些国家的人民竭尽全力来改变他们的政府对阿尔及利亚的态度。
