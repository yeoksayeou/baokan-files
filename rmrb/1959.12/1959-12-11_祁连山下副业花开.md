Under the Qilian Mountains, sideline industries are blossoming.

    The Qilian Deer Farm in Qilian County now raises thirty-seven young deer. Stepping into the deer farm, one is greeted by the sight of lithe young deer leaping and bounding. Most of these young deer were carefully raised after being captured as fawns. Currently, with the assistance of people of all ethnic groups, the deer farm employees are taking advantage of the winter hunting season to capture young deer.
    In September, Haomen Farm built three fish ponds and caught 150,000 wild Qinghai Lake naked carp fry from the nearby Haomen River for trial breeding. During the trial breeding process, the fish fry have been developing and growing well.

    祁连山下副业花开
    祁连县祁连养鹿场，现在已饲养幼鹿三十七只。走进鹿场，身材矫健的小鹿就会迎着人蹦蹦跳跳。这些小鹿，大都是捕到鹿羔后经过精心饲养成长的。养鹿场职工目前正在各族群众协助下，趁冬季狩猎捕捉幼鹿。
    浩门农场在9月份修建了三个养鱼池，到附近的浩门河中捞捕野生的湟鱼苗试养，两个多月来已经捕捞鱼苗十五万尾。在试养过程中，鱼苗发育成长情况良好。
