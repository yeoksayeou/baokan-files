    The statement said that the Japanese Communist Party feels honored today to be able to commemorate Katayama Sen's glorious achievements together with people from all walks of life in Japan and people from all over the world. We believe that he should be regarded as the pride of the Japanese people, and his great life of struggle for the liberation of the Japanese and world people and for peace should be promoted to the broad masses of the people. At the same time, we must inherit his legacy and strive to further develop the cause of the Japanese people and the Japanese Communist Party.
