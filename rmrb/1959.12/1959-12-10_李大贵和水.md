In the old days, in the mountains of Jun County, farmers had to worship the "Dragon King" every year on the second day of the second lunar month. They offered pig heads and "human heads" (the person offering would kneel before the "Dragon King," cut their forehead, and drip drops of blood as a "human head"), begging the "Dragon King" for a year of favorable weather. Of course, in the end, it was either drought or flood, year after year.

	Developing Production Requires Water Management

Li Dagui (National Model Agricultural Laborer, Deputy Director of Xijiadian People's Commune in Jun County, Hubei Province) lived in Lijiawan. In front of the village was the Da Bai River, and behind it was Wolong Ridge. A heavy rain would cause the river to rise, washing away the fertile soil of the ridge, leaving gullies; the fertile soil of the river滩 (滩 is an area of flat land near a river or coast) was washed away, leaving piles of stones. After the rain, the river would dry up within a month. Not to mention diverting water to irrigate the fields, even drinking water for people had to be obtained by digging pits and springs. The bare Wolong Ridge couldn't grow trees; the white, glittering river灘 couldn't grow weeds.

It was truly a disaster! Eighteen of the twenty-three households in Lijiawan lived in dilapidated thatched houses, with holes in the front and back. The entire village had only a little over one mu of paddy fields. Every year, they ate pumpkins for four months and sweet potatoes for eight months; eating a meal of white rice was like celebrating the New Year. In years of disaster, twenty-two out of the twenty-three households fled the famine and begged for food. By the time Lijiawan was liberated in 1947, only eighteen households remained.

In 1951, Lijiawan established a mutual aid team, with Li Daming as the leader and Li Dagui as the deputy leader. They thought: if production is to develop, we must manage water and plant more paddy fields. They divided the river滩 into pieces for the team members, whoever planted it would harvest it. The team members exchanged labor, opening up eight mu of paddy fields. With few people and little strength, the soil they spread was thin; the seedlings they planted couldn't stand firm and had to be weighed down with stones. The first year they had a harvest, and the team members were very happy. The second year they opened up another eleven mu of fields.

	Bringing River Water Up the Hillside

In the spring of 1954, Lijiawan established an agricultural production cooperative. As soon as the cooperative was established, it started opening up the river滩, improving the soil, and developing paddy fields.

After the rice seedlings were planted, Dagui began to think: how can we increase production? At first, he considered the mountain gullies, wanting to dig a channel along the gully and dig a small pond with an area of half a mu, so that the mountain water would flow into the pond. However, at ordinary times, the mountain water was like a cat's urine, and the small pond couldn't even be filled; when it rained, the mountain water flowed quickly and washed the pond away at once.

If mountain water can't be managed, can we dig a channel to bring river water up the hillside? Dagui walked up the river滩, thinking and looking. When he reached the upper part, he saw that the riverbed was very steep, and after reaching the 崩土? (possibly a local term for a geological feature, translated as "collapsed soil slope" for now), it was level with the fields of Lijiawan. He thought: there's a way. The next day, he asked the carpenter Rao Duqing to take a look. Rao Duqing said, "Yes! It looks like the collapsed soil slope is as level as the fields of Lijiawan." Dagui also discussed it with Li Dayi, who said, "It looks like the water can come up, but this matter is not simple!" Dagui couldn't make up his mind and kept thinking about what to do.

Once, Dagui accompanied County Party Secretary Chen Yuwen to the riverbank, and incidentally leaned on the river灘 to measure the collapsed soil slope. Comrade Chen Yuwen asked, "What are you looking at?" Dagui said, "I want to build a channel to bring water up the hillside from the collapsed soil slope, do you think it will work?" Comrade Chen Yuwen looked at it and said, "As long as it can go up, why not?" This sentence strengthened Dagui's determination to bring water up the mountain.

Dagui convened a meeting of the cooperative committee to discuss the construction of the channel. At this time, the cooperative had expanded to thirty-eight households, and six of the nine committee members disagreed. Some said, "This is like pulling a boat on dry land, a wild goose chase!" Some said, "Even if the water comes up, the yellow clay soil can't be turned into paddy fields." Some said, "The area is large, the labor force is small, we can't change it." Everyone was talking at once, arguing endlessly. There was no way to resolve it, so the meeting was adjourned. Dagui was anxious and went home to sleep.

The news of the channel construction spread, and the villagers discussed it. Dagui's wife said to Dagui, "In the entire cooperative of dozens of households, only you, Dagui, care!" Dagui got angry and argued with her. Dagui's blind father also said, "Dagui! It's better to do less than to do more. Building a channel is a good thing, but if the water can't be brought up, the labor is wasted, the money is spent, the villagers will complain, and the government won't agree!"

	Dagui's Leveling Instrument

What to do? Give up? No! Dagui convened a meeting of Party and Youth League members and key figures, calculated the increase in production from converting land to paddy fields, and mobilized the Party and Youth League members to take the lead in building the channel. Everyone agreed to build it, but they were afraid that the water wouldn't come up. Dagui himself relied on his eyes, but he wasn't very sure. He thought about it during the day and at night, and suddenly he thought of the aiming practice when he was a militiaman. "Can't I use a bamboo tube to aim now?" The next day, he brought a table to the river灘, scooped up a handful of sand, piled it on the table, put a bowl of water on the sand to adjust the level, found a bamboo tube, made a small hole at one end, and put a crosshair at the other end, placed it on the bowl, looked through the small hole, and the level was very clear. "It works, the target is found, the water can come up." He immediately returned to the village and called everyone to see. Some people looked at it once, then again. The young people believed it and said, "Dagui is really capable! The small bamboo tube is effective. This channel can be built!"

On the sixteenth day of the first lunar month in 1955, construction began. Dagui checked the level and directed everyone to dig the channel. Dig a section of soil, release a section of water; connect a section of water, then dig a section of soil. At this time, a few of the older villagers had not yet come around and deliberately made things difficult for Dagui, not digging according to the measured line. As a result, the soil was dug, but the water didn't flow. Dagui knew what was going on, so he adjusted the people, letting those who had come around dig the channel, and those who hadn't carry stones. In four and a half days, the channel was completed, and the water flowed over. The villagers were overjoyed, and men, women, old and young, all ran out to see the water. Dagui's blind father also felt his way to the riverbank, touched the water in the channel with his hand, and said, "Is this the water of the Da Bai River? Am I not dreaming?" The old man smiled happily, and Dagui's wife also smiled at Dagui.

This year, Lijiawan converted forty mu of land to paddy fields, expanding the paddy field area to seventy mu. The total output of rice for the year increased by 110% compared to 1954, and each person received one hundred and ten jin of rice. This channel attracted the surrounding mutual aid teams. With the arrival of the high tide of cooperativization in winter, the masses joined the cooperative one after another. By the spring of 1956, the cooperative had expanded to one hundred and fifty-six households.

During the high tide of cooperativization, the district sent Dagui to Zhujiaying to help build a cooperative. Zhu Mingjun, who lived near Zhujiaying, repeatedly consulted with Dagui, wanting to bring water to the Wu Jia River. Dagui heard people say that there was water in Luzichi Gully, so he took some time to go there.

As soon as he arrived at Luzichi Gully, Dagui visited the oldest farmer, Grandpa Wang Si, and asked him to take him to see the water. In the mountain hollow, there was a Dragon King Temple, and below the temple was a small dam, blocking a pool of clear water. Outside the dam, there were three springs, each the size of a vegetable bowl, flowing down the gully. Dagui asked Grandpa Wang Si, "Why isn't this water dammed up?" Grandpa Wang Si said, "It was dammed up in the past. As soon as it was dammed up, a flood washed it clean. When it was dammed up again, another flood washed away even the stones." After Dagui asked in detail where the water came from, how much there was in dry weather, and how much there was in rainy weather, he had a good idea: this water could not only be brought to the Wu Jia River, but also be used by several villages below.

	Good Things Take Time

After cooperativization, the county, district, township, and cooperative were all drawing up long-term plans. Dagui proposed to bring the water from Luzichi Gully and build the Wolong Long Channel, descending the mountain, which could build a dozen reservoirs, convert seven thousand two hundred mu of fields, and benefit nine cooperatives in two townships. Zhao Xiu, the First Secretary of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee, heard about this and attached great importance to it. He quickly sent cadres from the Water Conservancy Bureau to help with the measurement. Who knew that good things are hard to come by, and they encountered resistance from conservative ideas again.

In 1956, Dagui twice requested the township general branch to start construction of the long channel, but the township head, Liu Bingtian, said, "The masses' thinking is not clear." Dagui said, "If it's not clear, let's hold a township people's congress to discuss it!" Liu Bingtian said, "Let's not hold a meeting! The more we meet, the more opinions there will be." At that time, the cooperatives were small. In one township with ten cooperatives, only the tenth, sixth, and first cooperatives would benefit greatly and were willing to do it; the ninth cooperative was upstream and didn't need it very much; the second, fourth, and fifth cooperatives were downstream and were afraid that the water would be small and wouldn't flow down; the third, seventh, and eighth cooperatives would not benefit and didn't want to do it. The construction of the channel had to be put aside for the time being.

After the rice seedlings were planted in 1957, Dagui once again proposed discussing the issue of channel construction at the township people's congress. As soon as he finished speaking, Liu Bingtian flew into a rage: "The masses have a lot of opinions about your proposal to build water conservancy projects. I said not to build them for your own good! If you don't believe me, go ask the director of the sixth cooperative, Zhao Wenhua." Dagui said, "The director of the sixth cooperative, Zhao Wenhua, told me that if others don't build it, our two cooperatives will build it together!" Liu Bingtian criticized Dagui at the meeting and, after the meeting, called him into his house and criticized him again. The township general branch secretary didn't say who was right or who was wrong in this debate. In this way, the construction of the long channel was shelved.

	"Build it, build it boldly!"

In July 1957, Dagui went to the prefectural committee to attend a symposium. Comrade Zhao Xiu asked him, "Has the Wolong Long Channel been built?" Dagui hesitated and didn't say anything. Comrade Zhao Xiu smiled and said, "Someone is opposed to it, right! You build it, build it boldly. How much money do you need?" Dagui said, "A thousand or so yuan." Comrade Zhao Xiu said, "Okay, the organization will help you solve any difficulties." Dagui was extremely happy. He reported to Comrade Chen Yuwen in the county, and Comrade Chen Yuwen said, "That's very good! We'll send a county committee member to help you with the planning." Two days later, County Chief Luo came and held a general meeting of cadres in the township, specifically to discuss the construction of the Wolong Long Channel. A command headquarters was established, with County Chief Luo as the commander and Dagui as the deputy commander. In October, construction of the long channel began.

However, on October 6th, the agreed-upon date for the start of construction, people came sparsely. It was difficult to urge fifty or sixty people to come, but although the people came, their hearts didn't. Some were worried about the distribution at home; some wanted to go up the mountain to gather firewood, fearing that there would be no firewood to burn if it snowed; some wanted to engage in some sideline occupations to earn some money and make clothes; some wanted to cultivate their private plots and plant some melons and vegetables; some said that the construction started late, and this year they would only do half of it, and if it rained, it would be silted up, laboring in vain, so it would be better to start construction early next year; some were worried that the water was only so much, and those upstream would have enough to irrigate, but those downstream wouldn't. After Dagui reported these ideological situations that he had learned to the Party branch, he said, "The masses are watching the Party members and cadres. If the Party members and cadres work hard, the masses will work hard; if the cadres don't work hard, the masses won't be willing to work hard. We can't just take care of the interests of our own cooperative; we must think about the long-term happiness of the masses." The branch strengthened ideological work and made necessary arrangements for the actual difficulties in the lives of the masses. The hearts of the masses were united, and their enthusiasm also increased.

	Hard Work First

The first step in building the channel was to clear the bottom of the dam. The bottom was a layer of stone and a layer of sand, constantly seeping spring water. The north wind grew stronger every day. The villagers wore only a cotton jacket on their upper body, and were barefoot, standing in the water to clear the bottom, feeling unbearably cold. The villager Zhang Mazi said to Dagui, "The masses are watching the cadres with their eyes open. If the cadres work, the masses will work; if the cadres don't work, the masses won't be willing to work." The next day, Dagui took the lead in jumping into the water, and when the other cadres saw it, they all followed suit. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses was rekindled. They cleared and cleared, and cleared to a depth of five or six chi, but still hadn't reached the bottom. The masses were a little discouraged, and some cadres also wavered. When they cleared to a depth of more than one zhang, suddenly the soil was about to collapse. A villager shouted, "Quick, the soil is about to collapse!" Dagui looked up and saw that the soil was collapsing downwards. The villager Zhang Huahu was still trying to save furniture. Dagui quickly pulled Huahu behind him. In an instant, stones and loose soil collapsed together, Dagui's leg sank into the soil, and Zhang Huahu's knee was crushed to the bone. Someone said to Dagui, "How dangerous! We shouted at you, but you were still worrying about others." Dagui smiled and said, "He is a villager, and I am a cadre!" Some people were frightened by this scene and said, "Look, something happened! It's not worth dying." Zhang Huahu continued, "Don't be afraid. The Yangtze River Bridge couldn't be sounded to the bottom for many years, but the Communist Party sounded it all at once. What is this mountain hollow?" The health worker wrapped his wound, and he jumped back into the pit to work. Many people said, "Oh, he's injured and still working like this, how can we not work? If you want to eat big fish, you have to cast a long line!" With one burst of energy, they cleared to the bottom.

	More Difficulties, More Solutions

More difficulties, more solutions. They made their own explosives; they replaced iron crowbars with willow branches cut from the mountain; they burned their own lime; they mobilized the villagers to make their own straw sandals. Working diligently and thriftily in water management, they spent only one thousand five hundred yuan to build the dam, saving more than half of the budget.

While building the dam at the top, they built the channel at the bottom. Each cooperative was divided into sections to be responsible for building and opening the channel. After the dam was built, they opened a section of the channel and released a section of water, but the water leaked out before it had gone very far. Dagui transferred five hundred people to dig the channel deeper and line the bottom with yellow soil. The water flowed for a while and then leaked out completely at Yuanshanbao. At this time, Township Head Liu Bingtian said sarcastically, "Are you convinced now? What I said in the past was for your own good!" Dagui became anxious and ran to Grandpa Wang Si for advice. Grandpa Wang Si said, "If you don't soak a bucket, it will still leak water. Building such a big channel, the earth shakes and the mountains move, I don't know how many cracks and seams there are, how can it be so solid! It will take two or three years to stop leaking." Hearing this, Dagui's courage grew. However, the fifth cooperative of Mingxing, the fourth cooperative of Hongguang, and the fifth cooperative of Hongguang were unwilling to continue.

Dagui thought, after so much trouble, the land below still can't be converted to paddy fields, what should he do? While thinking, he walked down along the Da Bai River. When he reached Cuijia Gully, he looked at the hill, and an idea popped into his head: "Can we bring the water from the Da Bai River up, one channel with two intakes, one dragon with two heads, wouldn't that be better?" Dagui took out the leveling instrument that County Chief Luo had given him and measured from the channel on the hill to the riverbank, finding that the intake was in Zhujiaying.

In December 1957, construction of the Zhujiaying intake began. Each person dug three chi per day, and the work was completed in ten days. However, after the water was released overnight, it couldn't get past the Duanjia Gully. When they looked, the hole in the bottom of the channel was the width of an abacus, more than half a li long, and more than one chi deep. Dagui decided to carry out the yellow mud stone soil from the hole and fill it with "gouzi youtu" (a type of oily soil). More than two hundred people worked for two days to repair it. Two days later, after a night of heavy rain, ninety-two places collapsed. Just after it was repaired, there was another night of rain, and the top collapsed again. The masses were furious, like arguing over orchid beans, lots of opinions. Finally, Director Yang of the county committee said, "If you collapse it, I'll fill it, we must get the water through!" People were sent day and night to guard and repair it. By the end of March 1958, the channel water flowed through. A rushing stream of water flowed up Wolong Ridge and into the Lujia Gully Reservoir. Now, the bare mountains have become green mountains, the dry land has become paddy fields, and the people of Wu Jia Gully are also eating rice.

Now the paddy fields in Lijiawan have grown from one mu and four li before liberation to one thousand two hundred mu, an average of one and a half mu per person. They are not afraid of drought or flood, and the total grain output increases year after year. This year, there was a drought for a hundred days, the river didn't rise, and the rain didn't soak the soil, but without pumping water, production still increased. The production team where Lijiawan is located expects the total grain output this year to increase by 25% compared to last year, averaging one thousand two hundred jin per person.

The story of Li Dagui taking the lead in water management quickly spread throughout the prefecture, the province, and the country.

专栏：

    李大贵和水
    中共湖北省委、襄阳地委、均县县委　工作组
    旧时代，在均县的山里，每逢旧历二月初二，农民都要敬“龙王爷”。供上猪头，供上“人头”（当供的人，跪在“龙王爷”面前，划破自己的额头皮，滴下一滴滴鲜血当“人头”），求“龙王爷”开恩，给个风调雨顺年。当然，到头来，不是旱，就是淹，年年如此。
    发展生产必须治水
    李大贵（全国农业劳动模范、湖北省均县习家店人民公社副主任）住在李家湾。湾的前面是大柏河，后面是卧龙岗。一场大雨，河里起了水，岗地的肥土被带走了，留下一道道水沟；河滩的肥土被冲走了，留下一堆堆石头。雨后，过不了一个月，河就断流。不要说引水灌田，连人喝的水都得掏坑挖泉。光秃秃的卧龙岗，树木不长；白闪闪的河滩地，野草不生。
    真是遭孽！李家湾二十三户人家，十八间草房，间间是前后塌，两头通。全湾只有一亩多水田。年年都是四个月南瓜，八个月红薯；吃上一顿白米饭，好比是过年。遇到灾年，二十三户人家有二十二户逃过荒、讨过饭。到1947年李家湾解放时，只剩下十八户。
    1951年，李家湾成立了互助组，李大明当组长，李大贵当副组长。他们想：要想生产发展，必须治水，多种水田。他们把河滩划成一块块的分给组员，谁种谁收。组员互相换工，开了八亩水田。人少力量小，铺的田土少，土层薄；插的秧站不住，要用石头压秧根。第一年有了收成，组员很高兴，第二年又开了十一亩田。
    把河水引上山坡
    1954年春天，李家湾建立起农业生产合作社。合作社一成立，就大开河滩，改良土壤，发展水田。
    秧插罢了，大贵动了心思：怎样才能增产？起初，他从山沟里打主意，想顺着山沟开渠，挖一口半亩面积的小塘，让山水顺渠流到塘里。可是，平时山水像猫子尿，小塘也浇不满；下雨，山水流的急，一下子就把塘冲垮了。
    山水治不住，能不能开渠引河水上山坡呢？大贵顺着河滩往上走，一边走，一边想，一边看。走到上边，他看见河床很陡，到了崩土?那里以后就和李家湾的田平起来了。他想：有办法了。第二天就请木匠饶笃清去看。饶笃清说：“是呀！看上去崩土?和李家湾的田是一样平。”大贵又和李大义商量，大义也说：“看着水是能上来，可是这事不简单呀！”大贵心里拿不定主意，一直琢磨着怎么办好。
    有一次，大贵陪着县委书记陈玉文同志走到河边，顺便又趴在河滩上测量崩土?。陈玉文同志问：“你在看啥？”大贵说：“我想修条渠，从崩土?引水上山坡，你看行不行？”陈玉文同志看了一看，说：“只要上得去，为啥不行？”这一句话，坚定了大贵引水上山的决心。
    大贵召集社委开会，讨论修渠的事。这时合作社已经扩大到三十八户，九个社委员当中，就有六个人不同意。有的说：“这是旱地拉船，胡球搞！”有的说：“水上来，黄胶泥地也不能改水田。”有的说：“面积大，劳力少，改不过来。”你一言，我一语，吵个不休。没办法，散了会，大贵干着急，回家倒头便睡。
    修渠的事传开了，社员们议论纷纷。大贵的媳妇对大贵说：“全社几十户人家，就你大贵一个人会操心！”大贵气得和她吵起来。大贵的瞎子爹爹也说：“大贵呀！多一事不如少一事。修渠是好事，要是水引不上来，工花了，钱费了，社员埋怨，政府也不答应你呀！”
    大贵的水平仪
    咋办呢？罢手吗？不行！大贵召开党团员骨干会，算了算改水田的增产账，动员党团员带头修渠。大伙同意修，但是又怕水上不来。大贵自己凭眼看，也拿不很准。白天想，黑夜想，他忽然想到过去当民兵的时候练习瞄准的事情。“现在能不能用竹筒管瞄准呢？”第二天，他端了一个桌子，来到河滩，捧了一捧沙，堆在桌上，一只盛水的碗，搁在沙上调整水平，找一根竹管筒，一头打一个小眼，另一头穿上一个十字架，放在碗上，从小眼里望过去，水平看得很清楚。“行了，目标找到了，水能上来。”他马上回到湾里，把大伙叫来看。有的人看一遍，又一遍。年青人相信了，说：“大贵真算能！小竹筒有板眼。这条渠能修！”
    1955年旧历正月十六日，开始动工。大贵看水平，指挥大伙挖渠。挖一节土，放一节水；通一节水，再挖一节土。这时，少数年老的社员思想还没有通，故意和大贵作难，不按测量的线挖。结果是土挖了，水不通。大贵心里有数，他调整了一下人，让思想通的人挖渠，思想不通的人挑石头。四天半的时间，渠修通了，水流过来了。社员们乐坏了，男女老少都跑出来看水。大贵的瞎子爹爹，也摸到河边来，用手摸着渠里的水，说：“这是大柏河的水吗？这不是在做梦吧？”老人高兴地笑了，大贵的媳妇也望着大贵笑了。
    这一年，李家湾改了四十亩水田，水田面积扩大到七十亩，全年稻谷总产量比1954年增加110％，每人分到稻谷一百一十斤。这条渠吸引了周围的互助组。冬季合作化高潮到来，群众纷纷入社。到1956年春天，这个社扩大到一百五十六户。
    合作化高潮时期，区里派大贵到朱家营帮助建社。朱家营附近的朱明君几次找大贵商量，想把水引到吴家河。大贵听人说芦子齿沟有水，就抽个空跑去了。
    一到芦子齿沟，大贵就访问了年纪最大的老农王四爷，请他带着去看水。山凹里，有一座龙王庙，庙下一个小坝，拦住一洼清水。坝外还有三股菜碗大的泉水，顺山沟往下流。大贵问王四爷：“这水为啥不闸住？”王四爷说：“往年闸过。刚闸好，一水打得精光。再闸好，又一水打得连石头都不见。”大贵详细地问了水从哪里来，天干多大，天雨多大等等细节以后，心中有了底：这水不但可以引到吴家河，而且下面几个村子都用得着。
    好事不怕多磨
    合作化以后，县里、区里、乡里、社里，都在订远景规划。大贵就提出要引芦子齿沟的水，修卧龙长渠，盘山而下，可以修十几个水库，改田七千二百亩，两乡九社受益。襄阳地委第一书记赵修同志听说这件事，很重视，很快就派来了水利局的干部，帮助测量。那晓得，好事多磨，又遇到了保守思想的抵抗。
    1956年，大贵两次向乡总支要求动工修长渠，乡长刘炳田说：“群众思想不通。”大贵说：“不通，开个乡人民代表大会，讨论讨论看！”刘炳田说：“不开会吧！越开，意见越大。”那时是小社，一个乡十个社，只有十社、六社、一社受益大，愿意搞；九社在上水，不很需要；二社、四社、五社在下头，怕水小，流不下来；三社、七社、八社不受益，不想搞。修渠的事只好暂时放下了。
    1957年插秧完毕，大贵再次提出在乡人民代表大会上讨论修渠问题。话音一落，刘炳田就大发脾气：“群众对你主张修水利的意见很大，我说不修是好意。不信，你到六社去问。”大贵说：“六社赵文华主任对我说，别人不修，我们两社合修哩！”刘炳田在会上把大贵批评了一顿，会后叫到屋里又批评了一顿。乡总支书记在这场争论里，不说谁对，也不说谁不对。就这样，修长渠的事，一巴掌打到箱子里去了。
     “修吧，大胆修！”
    1957年7月，大贵到地委开座谈会。赵修同志问他：“卧龙长渠修了没有？”大贵吞吞吐吐地不好说。赵修同志一笑，说：“有人反对吧！你修，大胆修。要多少钱？”大贵说：“千把元。”赵修同志说：“行，有困难组织上帮你解决。”这一下，大贵可高兴极了。回到县里向陈玉文同志汇报，陈玉文同志说：“好得很！我们去一个县委委员帮你作规划。”过两天，罗县长来了，开了个全乡的干部大会，专门讨论修卧龙长渠的事。成立了指挥部，罗县长当指挥长，大贵当副指挥长。10月，长渠动工了。
    可是，到了约好动工的10月6日，人来得稀稀拉拉。好不容易催来了五、六十人，人来了，心没有来。有的记挂家里的分配；有的要上山打柴，怕一下雪，屋里没柴烧；有的想抓点副业，挣点钱，做件衣裳；有的想弄一下自留地，种点瓜瓜菜菜；有的说动工晚了，今年搞个半截子，一下雨淤了，劳而无功，不如明年早动工；有的顾虑水只这么大，有上头浇的，没有下头浇的。大贵把他了解到的这些思想情况向党支部汇报以后说：“群众看党员、看干部，党员、干部要带头干，不能光顾自己一社的利益，要为群众的长远幸福着想。”支部加强了思想工作，对群众生活上的实际困难作了必要的安排，群众的心一齐，干劲也大了。
    苦干在前
    修渠的第一步，是拦水坝清底。底子是一层石头，一层沙，不断往外浸泉水。北风一天紧一天，社员上身空棉袄，下边打赤脚，站在水里掏底，冷得受不住。社员张麻子对大贵说：“群众睁着眼睛看干部，干部干，群众就干；干部不干，群众不愿干。”第二天，大贵带头跳下水去，别的干部一看，也都跟着下去了。这样，群众的劲头又起来了。掏呀，掏呀，掏到五、六尺深还是沙，没见到底，群众有些泄气，有的干部也动摇了，掏到一丈多深，忽然土要塌下来了。一个社员喊了一声：“快，土要塌了！”大贵抬头一看，土正在往下坐，社员张华虎还在抢家具。大贵连忙把华虎往身后拉过来，霎时间，石头、浮土一齐塌下来，大贵的腿陷在土里，张华虎的膝头轧得见了骨头。有人对大贵说：“多险啊！喊你，你还在顾别人”，大贵听了，笑一笑说：“人家是社员，我是干部呀！”有的人见到这般情景害起怕来，说：“你看，出事了吧，死人划不着。”张华虎接着说：“不要害怕，长江大桥多年探不到底，共产党一下子就探到了底，我们这山洼子算个啥？”卫生员给他裹了裹伤，他又跳下坑去干。好多人都说：“唉呀，人家受伤还这样干，我们还能不干？想吃大鱼，要放长线啊！”大伙儿一股劲，就掏见了底。
    困难多，办法更多
    困难多，办法更多。炸药，自己做；铁橇，上山砍花柳树杠子代替；石灰，自己烧；草鞋，发动社员自己打。这样勤俭治水，只花一千五百元就把坝修好了，比预算节省一半还多。
    高头修坝，下头修渠。各社划分地段，包修包通。坝修好后，开一节渠，放一节水，可是没放多远，水就漏光了。大贵调了五百人，把渠挖深些，挑黄土垫底。水流了一段，到圆山包，又漏光了。这时，乡长刘炳田说起风凉话来：“你还服不服？过去我说的话是害你！？”大贵急了，跑去向王四爷请教。王四爷说：“买个水桶，不泡一泡，还要漏水。修这么大一条渠，地动山摇，晓得多少口子、多少缝，那里会那么结板！总得二、三年才能不漏。”这一说，大贵的胆子才壮起来。但是，明星五社、红光四社、红光五社都不愿继续搞了。
    大贵想，费了这么大周折，下面还是改不成田，怎么办？一边想，一边顺着大柏河走下来。走到崔家沟，上岗瞅一瞅，一个思想跳出来：“能不能把大柏河的水引上来，一渠二首，一龙二头，不是更好吗？”大贵回家把罗县长送给他的水平仪拿出来，从岗上的渠道往河边测，找到了渠首在朱家营。
    1957年腊月，朱家营渠首动工了。每人每天挖三尺，十天完了工。可是，水放了一夜，过不了段家沟。一看，渠底的洞子有算盘宽，半里多长，一尺多深。大贵决定把洞里的黄浆石土挑出来，把“狗子油土”填进去。两百多人干了两天才修好。过了两天，一夜大雨，垮了九十二处。刚修好，又是一夜雨，高头又垮了。群众气急了，像吵兰花豆一样，噼里啪拉，好多意见。最后县委杨部长说：“你垮我填，非要通水不可！”日日夜夜派人守护、抢修。干到1958年3月底，渠水通了。哗哗的一股大水，流上卧龙岗，流到芦家沟水库。现在，秃山变成青山，旱地变成水田，吴家沟的人也吃上大米了。
    现在李家湾的水田，由解放前的一亩零四厘，发展到了一千二百亩，平均每人一亩半。不怕干，不怕淹，粮食总产年年上长。今年大旱一百天，河不起水，雨不透墒，不用车水，照样增产。李家湾所在的生产队，今年粮食总产量预计比去年增加25％，平均每人可以达到一千二百斤。
    李大贵带头治水的事迹，像风一样很快地传遍了全专区、全省、全国。
