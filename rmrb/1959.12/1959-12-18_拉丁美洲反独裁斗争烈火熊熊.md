Xinhua News Agency, December 17th - As 1959 nears its end, an armed struggle against the Stroessner dictatorship has broken out in Paraguay. The flames of resistance burning in Paraguay have, like this year, swept through other Latin American countries ruled by the remaining dictatorships supported by the United States.

The anti-dictatorship struggle in Latin America has made significant progress this year. The victory of the Cuban people at the beginning of this year in overthrowing Batista, the U.S. puppet dictator, has inspired and promoted this struggle. In several major dictatorial countries—Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Paraguay—the anti-dictatorship struggles have taken the form of armed combat.

The armed struggle that broke out in Paraguay on December 12th is the result of the growing contradiction between the Paraguayan people and the Stroessner dictatorship, a U.S. lackey. Stroessner, on the one hand, betrays the nation and serves the military and economic interests of the United States, and on the other hand, implements a reign of terror, turning the entire country into a large concentration camp. The people have reached the end of their patience. As the Paraguayan Communist Party's "Unidad" pointed out in August, criticism of public opinion is not enough, and the people have decided to "criticize the dictatorial government's sinful offensive with weapons."

In Nicaragua, since the outbreak of the anti-dictatorship armed struggle at the end of May, despite the Somoza regime's massive suppression and detention of insurgents, the struggle continues to persist and develop with the support of the people. With the active help of local residents, the insurgents have continuously launched guerrilla activities in the western and northern areas, as well as in the province of Rivas in the northern Pacific coast area and the province of Chinandega in the south.

In the Dominican Republic, since the anti-dictatorship forces began fighting in mid-June this year, they have established two bases in the Constanza mountain area in the center and the Puerto Plata province mountain area in the north. Although the dictator Trujillo dispatched aircraft and fully American-equipped troops and mobilized a large number of foreign mercenaries to fight, the insurgents annihilated 400 government troops in the first six weeks of fighting alone.

The unity of anti-dictatorship forces in various countries has been significantly strengthened this year. Broad anti-dictatorship united front organizations including various political factions have been established in the four dictatorial countries of Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, and Haiti. They have formulated a common program including the establishment of democratic governments, implementation of land reform, and guaranteeing basic civil rights. At the same time, revolutionary exiles from various countries have established hundreds of anti-dictatorship organizations abroad, echoing the underground organizations at home, creating a tremendous momentum.

In the face of the rising anti-dictatorship movements at home and abroad, serious divisions have occurred within the dictatorial regimes. Obvious rifts have appeared in the two pillars of the Paraguayan dictatorial regime—the ruling National Republican Association-Colorado Party and the military. A strong opposition faction and a strong trend demanding the normalization of the constitutional system have formed within the National Republican Association-Colorado Party. Among the army, there is also a "liberal faction" opposed to the current government. In the Dominican Republic, the vice president, the Minister of Labor, and the governor of the Reserve Bank have all been assassinated by Trujillo this year for expressing dissatisfaction.

The U.S. imperialists are extremely alarmed by the current situation. Since the beginning of this year, the United States has carried out a series of open and behind-the-scenes activities, directly intervening in arranging the suppression of the people's resistance in various countries, supporting the dictatorial regimes, and attempting to use them to interfere in the Cuban revolution, vainly attempting to contain the giant wave of national democratic struggles of the people of Central and South America.

As early as mid-April, the United States, at its meeting of ambassadors to Caribbean countries, formulated detailed measures to suppress the national liberation movement in Central American countries, and decided to continue to step up arms and financial aid to dictators in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Haiti, and other countries. The United States sent officers to help the Dominican Republic and Haiti train their troops, while instructing the Dominican Republic to act as a vanguard for interfering in Cuba.

The awakened Latin American people are launching a raging struggle. The "Trinity" of "archbishops, American dollars, and dictatorial soldiers," which the Latin American people deeply hate, is on the verge of a major collapse, and no force can save them.

### 拉丁美洲反独裁斗争烈火熊熊

    拉丁美洲反独裁斗争烈火熊熊
    据新华社17日讯　当1959年接近岁末的时候，巴拉圭爆发了反对斯特罗斯纳独裁政权的武装斗争。燃烧在巴拉圭的反抗的火焰，今年以来同样席卷着美国支持下的拉丁美洲残存的其他几个独裁政权统治的国家。
    拉丁美洲反独裁斗争在今年有重大的发展，古巴人民今年年初推翻美国走狗独裁者巴蒂斯塔的胜利鼓舞和推动了这一斗争。在几个主要独裁国家——尼加拉瓜、多米尼加和巴拉圭反独裁斗争都采取了武装战斗的形式。
    巴拉圭12月12日爆发的武装斗争是巴拉圭人民同美国走卒斯特罗斯纳独裁政权的矛盾日益加剧的结果。斯特罗斯纳一面出卖民族，为美国的军事和经济利益效忠，一面实行恐怖统治，把整个国家变成一个大集中营。人民已经到了忍无可忍的地步。正像巴拉圭共产党“团结报”8月间指出的，舆论的批评已经不够，人民决定要“用武器来批评独裁政府罪恶的进攻”。
    尼加拉瓜在5月底爆发反独裁的武装斗争以来，尽管索摩查政权大事围剿和拘禁起义者，这一斗争在人民支持下仍在坚持和发展中。起义者在当地居民的积极帮助下，不断在西部、北部地带，以及太平洋沿岸地区北部的里瓦斯省和南部的奇南德加省展开游击活动。
    在多米尼加，反独裁部队自从今年6月中开始战斗以来，已经在中部康斯坦萨山区和北部普拉塔港省山区建立了两个根据地。尽管独裁者特鲁希略出动飞机和全部美式装备的军队并调动大批外籍雇佣兵作战，但是仅在战斗开始后的前六个星期，起义者就歼灭了政府军四百人。
    各国反独裁力量的团结在今年有了显著的加强。在尼加拉瓜、多米尼加、巴拉圭和海地这四个独裁政府统治的国家都建立了包括各种政治派别的广泛的反独裁统一战线组织，并且制定了包括成立民主政府、实行土地改革和保障公民基本权利的共同纲领。同时，各国的革命流亡者在国外成立了几百个反独裁组织，同国内的地下组织互相呼应，造成了巨大的声势。
    在国内外反独裁运动日益高涨的形势下，独裁政权的内部发生严重的分裂。在巴拉圭独裁政权的两大支柱——执政党国家共和党和军队中出现了明显的裂痕。国家共和党内形成了强有力的反对派和一股要求宪法制度正常化的强大潮流。在陆军当中，也出现了反对现政府的“自由派”。在多米尼加，今年以来，副总统，劳工部长和储备银行行长，都因流露出不满情绪而遭到特鲁希略的暗杀。
    美帝国主义者对于当前局面极为恐慌。今年以来美国进行了公开的和幕后的一系列活动，直接插手布置镇压各国人民的反抗，为独裁政权撑腰，并企图利用它们来干涉古巴革命，妄想遏止中南美人民民族民主斗争的巨浪。
    早在4月中旬，美国在它的驻加勒比地区国家使节会议上就详细拟定了镇压中美国家民族解放运动的措施，决定继续加紧以武器和金钱援助多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、海地等国独裁者。美国派遣军官帮助多米尼加、海地训练军队，同时，指使多米尼加充当干涉古巴的急先锋。
    觉醒了的拉丁美洲人民正在掀起如火如荼的斗争，拉丁美洲人民深切痛恨的“大主教，美国金元，独裁军人”三位一体的黑暗统治正处在大崩溃的过程中，任何势力也挽救不了它们。
