　　Unprecedented Bumper Harvests Rely on the Communes
　　Hexi Getu, First Secretary of the CPC Siziwang Banner Committee, Inner Mongolia
    Since the second half of 1958, under the correct leadership of the higher party committee and inspired by the General Line, Siziwang Banner, like other parts of the country, has achieved brilliant successes in various productions. Agricultural and pastoral production has greatly developed, the lives of farmers and herdsmen have significantly improved, the face of agricultural and pastoral areas has greatly changed, and the socialist construction cause of the whole banner has entered a new stage of development.

    The Great Leap Forward over the past year or so has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests in agriculture and animal husbandry. The total output of more than 1.6 million mu of crops sown in the banner this year reached more than 200 million jin, an increase of 88.5% over 1957 before communization. The average yield per mu of grain was 144.4 jin, an increase of 113% over 1957. Calculated on the basis of the banner's agricultural population, the amount of grain and oil per person increased by 86.3% compared with 1957.

    In the second half of 1958, the banner fully realized the cooperation and communization of animal husbandry, and successfully completed the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, paving the way for the high-speed development of animal husbandry. On the basis of 627,000 head (of livestock) in 1958, the banner's livestock had developed to more than 778,000 head (of livestock) by 1959. The total increase rate of various livestock reached 36.5%, with a total increase of more than 151,200 head (of livestock) in one year, and a net increase rate of 24.1%. Many high-yield achievements have emerged.

    The high-speed development of animal husbandry production has strongly supported the country's socialist construction. In the past two years (1958 and 1959), the banner sold a total of more than 146,000 head (of livestock) of various livestock to the state, supported the state with more than 1.76 million animal hides (including various wild animal hides), and more than 2.27 million jin of wool. The rapid development of animal husbandry production is inseparable from the conscientious implementation of the "Eight Measures" for animal husbandry production. This year, the problem of pasture without water and grass has been basically eliminated, and at the same time, forage base construction has been vigorously carried out. A total of 250,000 mu of forage and feed have been sown in the banner.

    While agriculture and animal husbandry have made great leaps forward, other socialist construction undertakings have also developed rapidly. In the past, Siziwang Banner had nothing but a handful of ironworkers, carpenters, and shoemakers, and no other industries. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, with soaring enthusiasm and overcoming numerous difficulties, various small factories, such as machinery factories, wineries, power plants, brick and tile factories, copper mines, coal mines, and precious blue stone mines, have been built and put into production like mushrooms after a spring rain. Finance and trade, culture and education, health, science, and technology have also made new and great progress. In 1959, the industrial output value plan was overfulfilled by 110.4% seventy days ahead of schedule; grain and oil purchase, financial revenue, urban savings, and other annual plans were overfulfilled ahead of schedule, realizing a complete victory in financial and trade work.

    The people's communes have given full play to their advantages in various production and construction undertakings. Socialist cooperation based on mutual assistance and mutual benefit between communes, management districts, and production teams has been greatly developed. During the spring sowing season, the communes supported each other with more than 600,000 jin of seeds and more than 200,000 jin of forage. As a result of resolutely relying on the masses, overcoming various difficulties, the spring sowing task was completed by 16.9% above quota despite insufficient production base, heavy spring sowing tasks, and tight time, laying a good foundation for this year's bumper harvest. The communes in the banner have established a total of 102 factories directly serving agricultural and animal husbandry production, such as machinery repair and chemical fertilizer, which have basically solved the problems of tool repair, small-scale manufacturing, etc. in agriculture and animal husbandry, and increased fertilizer supply, powerfully supporting agricultural and animal husbandry production. With the development of various construction undertakings, communes have universally established various welfare undertakings, establishing a total of 338 agricultural busy season canteens and 586 nurseries, liberating the vast number of women in agricultural and pastoral areas from housework and strengthening the agricultural and animal husbandry production front. After communization, large-scale capital construction (especially water conservancy construction) was carried out, land and labor were rationally utilized, and the potential for increased land production and the labor enthusiasm of commune members were fully exploited. In particular, after the development of diversified operations, resources were widely exploited, resulting in a large increase in income.

    The Great Leap Forward in Siziwang Banner over the past year or so is only the beginning of continuous leaps forward in the future. In the future, we will continue to forge ahead along this road of victory.

　　空前丰收靠公社
　　中共内蒙古四子王旗委员会第一书记　贺喜格图
    1958年下半年以来，四子王旗各项生产，在上级党委的正确领导和总路线的鼓舞下，同全国各地一样，都取得了辉煌的成就。农牧业生产有了很大发展，农牧民群众的生活有了显著的提高，农、牧区的面貌大大改观了，全旗的社会主义建设事业已经进入一个新的发展阶段。
    一年多来的大跃进，夺得了历史上所没有过的农、牧业大丰收。全旗今年播种的一百六十多万亩农作物，总产量达二亿多斤，比公社化前的1957年增长88.5％。粮食平均单位产量一百四十四点四斤，比1957年增长113％。按全旗农业人口计算，每人占有的粮食、油料，比1957年提高86.3％。
    1958年下半年，全旗全面实现了牧业合作化和公社化，胜利地完成了畜牧业的社会主义改造，为高速发展畜牧业铺平了道路。全旗牲畜在1958年的六十二万七千多头（只）基础上，到1959年已发展到了七十七万八千多头（只）。各种牲畜总增率达36.5％，一年内共增加大小牲畜十五万一千二百多头（只），纯增率达24.1％，并且出现了不少的高额丰产事迹。
    畜牧业生产的高速度发展，有力地支援了国家的社会主义建设，两年间（1958、1959年）全旗共交售给国家各种牲畜十四万六千多头（只），支援给国家畜皮一百七十六万多张（包括各种野生兽皮），绒毛二百二十七万多斤。畜牧业生产的飞速发展，是和认真贯彻执行牧业生产“八项措施”分不开的。今年这里基本上消灭了无水草场，同时大力建设饲料基地，全旗共播种饲草饲料二十五万亩。
    在农、牧业大跃进的同时，其它的各项社会主义建设事业都有了迅速发展。过去四子王旗除了寥寥无几的铁、木匠、钉鞋匠以外，再没有什么工业。自1958年大跃进以来，以冲天的干劲，克服了重重困难，各种小型工厂，如机械厂、酿造厂、发电厂、砖瓦厂、铜矿、煤矿以及名贵的大青石矿等等，如雨后春笋般地建成和投入了生产。财政贸易、文教卫生和科学技术等各项事业，也都有新的巨大的发展。1959年提前七十天超额完成了工业产值计划的110.4％；粮油征购、财政收入、城镇储蓄等都提前超额完成了年度计划，实现了财贸工作的满堂红。
    人民公社在各项生产建设事业中充分发挥了优越性。各公社、管理区以及生产队之间以互助互利为原则的社会主义大协作大大地开展起来。春播时，各公社之间互相支援的籽种有六十多万斤，草料二十多万斤。由于坚决依靠群众的结果，在生产底垫不足，春播任务大，时间又紧迫的情况下，克服了种种困难，超额16.9％完成了春播任务，为今年的大丰收打下了良好的基础。全旗各公社共建立了一百零二个机械修配、化肥等直接服务于农牧业生产的工厂，使农牧业的工具修配、小型制造等问题基本得到解决，并增加了肥料，有力地支援了农牧业生产。随着各项建设事业的发展，公社普遍建立各种福利事业，共建立三百三十八个农忙食堂、五百八十六个托儿所，使农牧区广大妇女从家务中解放出来，加强了农牧业生产战线。公社化后还大规模地进行了基本建设（特别是水利建设），合理地利用了土地和劳力，充分地发挥了土地增产潜力与社员的劳动积极性，尤其是发展多种经营以后，广泛地开辟了资源，使收入有很大增加。
    四子王旗一年多来的大跃进仅仅是今后不断跃进的开始，今后，我们将沿着这胜利的道路，继续鼓足干劲前进。
