    Guangxi Wild Raw Materials Transferred to Industrial Cities
    (Our newspaper, Nanning, 4th) The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is vigorously carrying out mass-based processing and transportation of wild plants. As of the end of November, the autonomous region's commercial departments had purchased over 1,889,000 dan of wild fibers, starches, oils, and tannin extracts.
    In order to consolidate and expand the results of the "small autumn harvest," various localities have adopted the "three-pronged" approach of simultaneous collection, processing, and transportation, ensuring good collection, good processing, and good transportation. They mainly adopted the following three methods for processing wild plants: For small-volume wild plants that require simple processing techniques and no investment, they widely organize the elderly and commune members to carry out preliminary processing in their spare time. The masses in Du'an Yao Autonomous County process the collected wild hemp and wild rattan into hemp ropes, bamboo baskets, and rattan hats. Commune members in Bobai County cut the large amounts of wild starches such as Dioscorea cirrhosa Lour and yellow dog head into slices for preliminary processing, and also used wild fibers to produce more than 7,000 dan of pulp; For those requiring certain equipment and investment, the communes and brigades adopted a combination of specialized team processing and mass-based shock processing. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,100 various wild plant processing factories have been established in Nanning, Yulin, Baise and other regions, and have processed more than 5,160,000 jin of oils, starches, tannin extracts, pulp, etc.; Those with more complex techniques, large production volume, and requiring comprehensive processing by large factories are concentrated in county processing factories for processing, in order to more rationally utilize raw materials and increase their value. At present, the wild plant processing factories in various counties of the autonomous region are generally directly linked to the communes, and the communes are continuously transporting raw materials to supply the factories for processing. In the upper and middle of November, Yulin region collected and transported 2,900 tons of wild plants to counties and transportation routes. The largest winery in Nanning City, the Red Star Winery, has been supported by wild starch raw materials from various counties and has reserves of more than half a year's worth of raw materials.
    In order to do a good job in processing, commercial departments in various places actively organized the supply of various processing tools and provided technical guidance. In Yulin region, 2,100 commercial cadres have gone deep into production brigades to assist in guiding processing.
    As of the end of November, the entire autonomous region had transferred more than 300,000 dan of wild plants, supplying paper-making, chemical and other departments in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places.

    广西野生原料调往工业城市
    本报南宁4日电　广西僮族自治区大力开展群众性的野生植物加工和调运工作。到11月底为止，自治区商业部门已收购野生纤维、淀粉、油料、栲胶一百八十八万九千多担。
    为了巩固和扩大“小秋收”的成果，各地都采取了边采集、边加工、边调运的“三边”办法，做到了采集好、加工好、调运好。他们加工野生植物，主要采取了以下三种方式：凡是小宗的、加工技术简单、不需要投资的野生植物，就广泛组织老人和社员利用空闲时间来初制加工。都安瑶族自治县的群众，把采集到的野麻、野藤加工成麻绳、竹篓和藤帽。博白县各公社社员们把采集到的大量薯莨、黄狗头等野生淀粉初制切成片，又利用野生纤维制造出七千多担纸浆；凡是需要一定设备和投资的，由各公社和大队采取专业队加工和群众性突击加工相结合的办法进行。据不完全统计，南宁、玉林、百色等专区已建立各种野生植物加工厂二千一百多个，现已加工出油脂、淀粉、栲胶、纸浆等五百一十六万多斤；技术较复杂、生产量大、需要大厂综合加工的，都集中到县加工厂加工，以便更合理地利用原料，提高使用价值。目前，自治区各县的野生植物加工厂，正普遍和公社直接挂钩，各公社都源源不断地调运原料，供应各厂加工。玉林专区在11月上中旬，集运到县和交通沿线的野生植物就有二千九百吨。南宁市最大的酒厂——红星酒厂，由于得到各县野生淀粉原料的支援，已储备有半年多的原料。
    为了作好加工工作，各地商业部门积极组织供应各种加工工具，进行技术指导等。玉林专区已有二千一百个商业干部深入生产大队，协助指导加工。
    截至11月底止，全自治区已调出野生植物三十多万担，供应北京、上海、天津、广州等地的造纸、化工等部门。
