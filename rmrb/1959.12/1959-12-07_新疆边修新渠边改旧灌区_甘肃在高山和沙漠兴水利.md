    Xinjiang Simultaneously Builds New Canals and Transforms Old Irrigation Districts
    Gansu Develops Water Conservancy in High Mountains and Deserts

    This newspaper reports: The winter water conservancy project in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is progressing rapidly. In the past two months, various regions have completed more than 43,787,000 cubic meters of earthwork, accounting for 26.3% of the planned water conservancy workload. On the construction sites of new water conservancy projects, 2.1 million mu of wasteland with well-organized canal systems have been reclaimed.
    This year's water conservancy construction in Xinjiang is more than double the scale of last year and the year before. Among the more than 300 water conservancy projects that have already started, key projects are mostly concentrated in the area along the Lanxin Railway in northern Xinjiang. Now, at more than 1,000 kilometers of water conservancy construction sites along the Tianshan Mountains, more than 100,000 farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups are braving the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius to build canals and dig reservoirs, in order to divert all the rivers of melted snow from the Tianshan Mountains and reduce seepage and loss in the Gobi Desert along the way. These projects include 38 dry-laid rubble channels for erosion and seepage prevention, two concrete channels, and 47 small and medium-sized reservoirs, which can expand the irrigated area by 2.85 million mu. Among them, the Urumqi River, Manas River, and Hutubi River and others, after treatment this winter and next spring, the river flow can be fully controlled. The dry-laid rubble projects for erosion and seepage prevention at the headworks of the large-scale Yarkand River, Gez River, and Cele River on the southern slope of the Tianshan Mountains are also underway.
    While building a large number of new water conservancy projects, farmers and herdsmen in various parts of Xinjiang also regard the renovation of old irrigation areas as an important aspect of this year's water conservancy campaign. The old irrigation areas after renovation have been completely renewed, and the canal system has been basically engineered. Water inlet gates and diversion gates have been set up for large and small canals along the river, laying the foundation for planned water use, soil improvement, and expansion of irrigation area. After land leveling in each irrigation area, a new landscape of contiguous land, straight canals, and well-organized ditches and ridges has also emerged.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: According to statistics as of November 24, Gansu Province has newly built 2.61 million mu of irrigated land, renovated 4.49 million mu of irrigated land, and the winter irrigation area has reached 8.95 million mu. The area where soil erosion has been initially controlled is more than 18,961 square kilometers, and the area where soil erosion has been basically controlled reaches more than 15,912 square kilometers.
    The canals, reservoirs, and soil and water conservation projects built in various places this year are mostly constructed in high mountains, plateaus, or deserts. Minqin County, surrounded by the Tengger Desert on three sides, has dug 1,374 "underground reservoirs" in the desert. The Taohui Canal in Lintao County, which is 65 kilometers long, crosses 95 gullies and 4 kilometers of frequently collapsing Xieshan Mountain, including the arduous Ya Huzu stone mountain blasting project, the Huanghougou large filling project, and the Dabi River aqueduct project, with a total of 168 large and small buildings, requiring more than 7 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. Now the first section of the project has been completed, and the gurgling Tao River water has been diverted to the dry ping at an altitude of 1,900 meters, irrigating 30,000 mu of land in winter.
    The high work efficiency construction movement is an important guarantee for the high-speed water conservancy construction in Gansu Province. According to statistics from Dingxi, Tianshui, and Pingliang prefectures alone, 600 water conservancy construction site factories have been set up, and 504,200 pieces of advanced tools have been created and promoted, which has promoted a leap in work efficiency, steadily improved quality, and greatly saved labor.

    新疆边修新渠边改旧灌区
    甘肃在高山和沙漠兴水利
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔族自治区冬修水利工程进展迅速。两个月以来，各地已经完成土方四千三百七十八万七千多立方，占计划水利工程量的26.3％，新修水利的工地上已经开垦出了二百一十万亩渠系整齐的荒地。
    新疆今年兴修水利的规模比去年和前年大一倍多，已经动工的三百多项水利工程中，重点工程多集中在新疆北部兰新铁路沿线一带。现在，沿天山一千多公里的水利施工点上，十万多名各族农牧民正冒着零下二十多度的严寒，修水渠、挖水库，要把几十条天山融雪的河流全部引下山来，减少在中途戈壁滩上的渗漏流失。这些工程中包括三十八条防冲防渗的干砌卵石渠道和两条混凝土渠道，四十七座中小型的蓄水库，共可扩大灌溉面积二百八十五万亩地。其中乌鲁木齐河、玛纳斯河、呼图壁河等河流，经过今冬明春的治理，河道流水便可得到全部控制。天山南麓规模宏大的叶尔羌河、盖孜河、策勒河的渠首防冲、防渗的干砌卵石工程也正在进行。
    在兴修大批新的水利工程的同时，新疆各地农牧民也把改建旧渠区当作今年水利运动的重要方面。经过改建的旧灌区面貌焕然一新，基本做到了渠系工程化。沿河大小渠道都设立进水闸、分水闸，为计划用水、改良土壤、扩大灌溉面，打下了基础。各灌区土地经过平整后，也出现了土地连片、水渠笔直、沟畦整齐的新的园田化的景象。
    据新华社兰州讯　截止11月24日统计，甘肃省新修水地二百六十一万亩，整修水地四百四十九万亩，冬灌面积已达八百九十五万亩，初步控制水土流失面积一万八千九百六十一余平方公里，基本控制水土流失面积达一万五千九百一十二余平方公里。
    今年各地兴修的渠道、水库和水土保持工程，大部是在高山大塬或沙漠上施工的。被腾格里大沙漠三面包围的民勤县，已在沙漠上挖成“地下水库”一千三百七十四个；临洮县全长六十五公里的洮惠渠，跨越了九十五条沟壑和四公里长的经常塌陷的泄山，其中有艰巨的鸦狐咀石山爆破工程，皇后沟大填方和大碧河的渡槽工程，共有大小建筑物一百六十八座，需做土石方达七百多万立方米。现在第一段工程已全部完工，已把淙淙的洮河水引上海拔一千九百米的旱坪，冬灌三万亩土地。
    高工效施工运动是甘肃省高速度进行水利建设的重要保证。仅据定西、天水、平凉三个专区统计，已经办起水利工地工厂六百个，创制推广先进工具五十万零四千二百件，促使工效飞跃上升，质量节节提高，劳力大量节约。（附图片）
