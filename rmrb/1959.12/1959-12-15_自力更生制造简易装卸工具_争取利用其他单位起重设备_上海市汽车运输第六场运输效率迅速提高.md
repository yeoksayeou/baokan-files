Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 14th: The Shanghai No. 6 Automobile Transportation Team has adopted a two-pronged approach to vigorously promote the mechanization of loading and unloading. Within a short year, the loading and unloading of goods has basically reached the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization, saving manpower and rapidly improving transportation efficiency.

During the great upsurge of technological innovation, all employees of the team, based on the principle of "one key for one lock," made tools according to what they were loading and unloading. Now, there are corresponding tools for loading and unloading various machine equipment of different weights, lengths, properties, and shapes, including indigenous, foreign, and semi-indigenous and semi-foreign ones. For loading and unloading particularly heavy materials, there are ten-ton cranes; for general materials, there are duck-head-type cranes and motorized winches. The methods they have used to manufacture loading and unloading tools through self-reliance can be summarized in four aspects. First, "imitation." In the process of manufacturing large-scale loading and unloading equipment, workers lacked technical data, so they imitated. Second, "creation." If there was a need for transportation that could not be imitated, they designed and created it themselves. Third, "learning." When encountering difficulties in production, they visited relevant factories for guidance, and sometimes invited experienced workers to the garage for instruction. Within the garage, workers also learned from each other, drawing on each other's strengths. Fourth, "searching." When there was not enough raw material in production, they tried every possible means to collect old and scrap materials, or used substitutes.

In order to strengthen cooperation with relevant units and make the most of their loading and unloading machinery, the No. 6 Transportation Team held regular meetings with cargo owners and dispatched liaison officers to major stations, docks, and some large factories to communicate information, coordinate plans, and arrange the use of loading and unloading machinery. There were four specific practices: First, using the mechanical equipment of stations and docks for loading and unloading automobiles. For example, when a ship unloaded cargo, the ship's boom directly loaded the cargo onto the car. Second, cars drove into the factory's workshop or parked at the door, and when the traveling crane transported the finished products from the workshop, they were directly hoisted onto the car. Third, the transportation team sent a certain number of cranes and forklifts to key stations, docks, and factories to be used together with the loading and unloading machinery of these units. In this way, the transportation team could send fewer loading and unloading machines. Fourth, for some factories that regularly transport large quantities of materials and have their own loading and unloading equipment, the transportation team sent a car squad to be stationed there, specializing in transportation for them and using the factory's machinery to help load and unload.

Practice has shown that this kind of cooperation is beneficial to all parties. Because of the quick loading and unloading of automobiles, the turnover of goods was accelerated, and the throughput of materials at stations and ports increased. Factories were also able to obtain raw materials and machine equipment supplies more timely, and finished products were able to leave the factory faster. On the transportation team's side, the materials loaded and unloaded using the machinery of various units currently account for more than 10% of the total mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading volume.

Because the No. 6 Transportation Team has basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, the cargo loading and unloading time has been greatly shortened, and the number of vehicle runs has increased accordingly. In November, each vehicle carried goods an average of 11.38 times a day, an increase of more than one-third compared with the same period last year. The number of loading and unloading workers has also been greatly reduced. Over the past year, this transportation team has transferred more than 500 people from loading and unloading work, trained them, and assigned them as drivers or repair technicians.

The workers of Shanghai No. 6 Automobile Transportation Team created a flatbed trailer specially for transporting large items. This type of vehicle is easy to load and unload, and can be lengthened and shortened. This is a picture of loading and unloading workers using this trailer to transport a 28.5-meter-long gantry crane.

    自力更生制造简易装卸工具  争取利用其他单位起重设备
    上海市汽车运输第六场运输效率迅速提高
    据新华社上海14日电　上海市汽车运输第六场采取两条腿走路的办法，大搞装卸机械化。在短短一年内，货物装卸基本上达到了机械化和半机械化的水平，使装卸人力节约，运输效率迅速提高。
    在大闹技术革新中，全场职工根据“一把钥匙开一把锁”的原则，装卸什么就做什么工具。现在，装卸各种不同重量、长度、性能和形状的机器设备，都有了相应的工具，其中有土的、洋的，也有半土半洋的。装卸特别重的物资有十吨大吊车，一般的有鸭头式吊车和机动绞盘，他们自力更生制造装卸工具的办法，归纳起来有四个方面。第一是“仿”。职工们在制造大型装卸设备的过程中，缺乏技术资料，就进行仿制。第二是“造”。运输上需要而无法仿制的，便自己设计、创造。第三是“学”。遇到生产上的疑难，就到有关工厂参观请教，有时也请一些老师傅来车场指导。在车场内部，工人们也相互学习，取长补短。第四是“找”。生产中原材料不够，就千方百计搜集旧料、零料，或者采用代用品。
    为了加强同各有关单位的协作，尽量利用他们的装卸机械，第六车场定期召开货主会议，并且派联络员驻在主要的车站、码头和部分大工厂，沟通情况。衔接计划，安排装卸机械的使用，在具体做法上有四种：首先是利用车站、码头的机械设备，为汽车装卸。例如汽车停在码头上，轮船卸货时，船上的吊杆直接把货装在车上。其次是汽车驶入工厂的车间或停在门口，行车把成品从车间运走的时候，就直接吊到车上。第三是车场派出一定数量的吊车、铲车到重点车站、码头和工厂，同这些单位的装卸机械放在一起使用。这样车场就可少派一些装卸机械。第四是对有些经常有大批物资运输而本身装卸设备较多的工厂，车场便派一个汽车小队驻在那里，专为他们运输，利用工厂的机械帮助装卸。
    实践结果表明，这样的协作对各方面都有利。由于汽车快装快卸，加速了货物周转，车站、港口的物资吞吐量提高。工厂也能更及时地获得原料材料和机器设备的供应，成品能够更快出厂。在车场方面，目前利用各单位机械装卸的物资，占到机械化半机械化装卸总量的10％以上。
    第六车场由于基本上实现了装卸机械化和半机械化，货物装卸时间大大缩短，车辆运行次数相应增加。11月份平均每辆车每天载运货物十一点三八次，比去年同期提高三分之一以上。装卸工人也大大减少了。一年来，这个车场从装卸工人中调出了五百多人，培训后担任了司机或修理技工。（附图片）
    上海市汽车运输第六场工人创造了专运大件的平板拖车。这种车装卸方便，能长短伸缩。这是装卸工人在用这种拖车装运28.5米的大行车。
