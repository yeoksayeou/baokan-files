	The ten-thousand-ton coal mining team is producing at high yield,
	One person does the work of two,
	Half a shift produces three hundred carts of coal,
	Mouths dry and stomachs hungry, they want to eat.
	The store sends a salesperson,
	Bringing everything to drink and eat,
	With soda and biscuits,
	Snacks and fruits delivered to their hands.
	Let's sing a quick verse,
	Everything is for producing more coal.
	Eating and listening happily,
	Adding fuel to the fire and increasing enthusiasm,
	The salesperson helps out,
	Exceeding the quota by one hundred and thirty percent.
	The secretary and mine director come to celebrate the achievement,
	Giving flowers, taking pictures, and praising them,
	Everyone sits in the seat of honor,
	The salesperson is placed in the very center.
	Glory should be attributed to the Party,
	The store is on the merit book.

    功劳簿上有商店万吨回采闹高产，一人顶上两人干，半班出煤三百车，嘴干肚饿想吃饭。商店派来售货员，喝的吃的带个全，有汽水、有饼干，点心、水果送手边。打起快板唱一段，一切为了多出炭。边吃边听心喜欢，火上加油干劲添，售货员、帮着干，超额任务一百三。书记矿长来庆功，戴花照像又称赞，人人都坐功臣席，售货员让在最中间。光荣应当归于党，功劳簿上有商店。
