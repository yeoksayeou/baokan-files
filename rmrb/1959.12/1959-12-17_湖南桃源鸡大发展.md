    Xinhua News Agency report: The Taoyuan large breed chicken in Taoyuan County, Hunan, one of China's famous breeds of high-quality chickens, has seen great development this year. As of mid-November, the number of chickens kept in cages in the county had increased sevenfold compared to last year, with an average of twenty chickens raised per household in the county.
    The Taoyuan large breed chicken is characterized by its high legs, large body, loud crowing, beautiful feathers, and high egg-laying rate. By July, the county had transferred 200,000 high-quality chicks and 800,000 eggs to other areas.
    In order to vigorously develop this excellent breed of chicken, the county has established nine "ten thousand chicken mountains (farms)" and three hundred and forty-six "thousand chicken farms." All six thousand seven hundred and twenty-eight canteens in the county have been transformed into "hundred chicken halls." In the development of chicken raising, in addition to actively developing collective chicken raising, collectives also lend breeding chickens and eggs to commune members to develop private chicken raising. Now, every household in the county raises chickens.

    湖南桃源鸡大发展
    据新华社讯　我国著名的良种鸡之一——湖南桃源县的桃源大种鸡，今年有很大发展。11月中旬全县存笼的鸡，比去年增加了七倍，全县每个农户平均养鸡二十只。
    桃源大种鸡的特点是腿高、体大，鸣声宏亮，羽毛美丽，产蛋率高。到7月份，全县外调良种仔鸡二十万只、种蛋八十万枚。
    为了大力发展这种优良鸡种，全县共办了九个万鸡山（场），三百四十六个千鸡场，全县六千七百二十八个食堂全部变成百鸡堂。在发展养鸡生产中，除积极发展集体养鸡外，还由集体借给社员种鸡、种蛋，发展私人养鸡，现在全县已经做到户户养鸡。
