Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Telegram: Currently, nearly 500,000 builders in the Soviet Union are working heroically on power station construction sites across the country, striving to accelerate the construction speed of power projects in the Seven-Year Plan.

According to Soviet newspapers, the All-Union Power Construction Engineering Conference recently held in Moscow has called on power engineering builders across the country to strive to reach the power engineering construction level stipulated for the final year of the Seven-Year Plan, 1965, one year ahead of schedule, and to put new power stations with a generating capacity of 10 million to 12 million kilowatts into production each year.

The Seven-Year Plan is a decisive stage for the Soviet Union to complete national electrification. During this period, the Soviet Union will build and renovate 230 power stations, and the total generating capacity of power stations across the country will increase by 58 million to 60 million kilowatts. In order to accelerate construction speed, Soviet power engineering builders have decided to adopt standard designs of prefabricated reinforced concrete when building power stations, and to comprehensively mechanize and widely automate the construction process. They guarantee to master new and advanced methods for constructing and installing large-scale thermal power stations, so that such a power station can be fully built and put into production in three to four years. They also guarantee to shorten the construction period of large-scale hydroelectric power stations to four to five years.

In order to achieve this goal, from 1962 onwards, the Soviet Union will use prefabricated components and structures produced in factories on a large scale to build power stations, and the mechanization degree of their earthwork, concrete work, and construction and installation work will reach 97%-98%. Auxiliary enterprises producing prefabricated components will be built in the eleven important power project construction areas stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan. The implementation of this measure alone will shorten the preparation period for the main work of each construction project by seven to eight months.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Telegram: The famous Soviet Academician Strumilin believes that in the next fifteen years, the Soviet Union can completely catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of the development level of the power industry.

The academician pointed out in an article published in the 47th issue of the Soviet magazine "New Times" this year that the current development level of the Soviet power industry is one-third of that of the United States. However, the development speed of the Soviet power industry has been several times faster than that of the United States in the past few decades. He said that compared with 1927, in 1957, the generating capacity of Soviet power stations increased by 28.5 times, while the generating capacity of American power stations only increased by four times during this period. In the above-mentioned thirty years, the generating capacity of Soviet power stations increased by an average of 205% every ten years, while the United States only increased by about 58%. He said that because the Soviet Union is developing much faster, by 1974, it can catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of the generating capacity of power stations, if not sooner.

Strumilin said that according to the plan formulated by the Americans, in the twenty-five years from 1955 to 1980, the growth rate of the generating capacity of American power stations will not exceed 126.5%, or an average increase of 41% every ten years. However, under peaceful development conditions, the growth rate of Soviet power generation capacity in the future may be higher than in the past few decades (including the war years). He said that according to the calculations of Soviet scientists, before 1977, the comparison of the development level of the power industry between the Soviet Union and the United States will be roughly as follows (unit: one million kilowatts):

	Year	Soviet Union	United States
	1957	48.4	143
	1967	148	226
	1972	257	284
	1974	314	310
	1977	450	357

That is to say, by 1972, the Soviet Union's generating capacity had been very close to the level of the United States, and by 1974 it would be 4 million kilowatts more than the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Telegram: The Kremenchug Hydroelectric Station, one of the important power construction projects stipulated in the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, has begun to generate electricity. Its first turbine unit with a generating capacity of 57,200 kilowatts supplied the first batch of electricity to nearby industrial enterprises on the 4th of this month. By the end of this year, it is expected that three more turbine units with the same generating capacity will be put into production.

The Kremenchug Hydroelectric Station is one of the cascade hydroelectric stations on the Dnieper River, the second largest river in the European part of the Soviet Union. Its total generating capacity is 625,000 kilowatts. After it is fully built and put into production, it can generate 2.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year. Due to the construction of the Kremenchug Hydroelectric Station, a huge reservoir with an area of 252,000 hectares has been built here. The reservoir's storage capacity accounts for a quarter of the average annual flow of the Dnieper River. It can ensure uninterrupted power generation at the Kremenchug Hydroelectric Station throughout the year, and can improve the power generation of the downstream hydroelectric stations on the Dnieper River—the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the Dneprodzerzhinsk Hydroelectric Station, and the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station—allowing them to produce 700 million kilowatt-hours more electricity each year. At the same time, it also makes it possible to double the generating capacity of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station (640,000 kilowatts). (Attached picture)

    争取提前一年达到七年计划动力工程建设水平
    苏联加快电站工程建设速度
    重要动力工程之一克列门楚格水电站开始发电
    苏联电力工业发展速度比美国快几倍
    最近十五年内发电能力必将赶上美国
    据新华社莫斯科电　目前，苏联差不多有五十万建设者在全国各地发电站建筑工地上英勇地劳动，力争加快七年计划动力工程的建设速度。
    据苏联报纸报道，最近在莫斯科举行的全苏动力建筑工程会议已经号召全国动力工程建设者，争取提前一年达到七年计划规定的最后一年即1965年的动力工程建设水平，每年使发电能力为一千万到一千二百万瓩的新发电站投入生产。
    七年计划是苏联完成全国电气化的决定性阶段。这期间，苏联将新建和改建二百三十座发电站，全国发电站的总发电能力将增加五千八百万至六千万瓩。为了加快建设速度，苏联动力工程建设者决定在建设发电站时，采用装配式钢筋混凝土的标准设计，并使建设过程全面机械化和广泛自动化。他们保证掌握新的，先进的建设和安装大规模火力发电站的方法，使一座这样的发电站能在三、四年内全部建成和投入生产。他们同时还保证把大规模水电站的建设期限缩短到四年至五年。
    为了达到这一目的，从1962年起，苏联就将大规模用工厂预制的装配式构件和结构建设发电站，它们的土方工程、混凝土工程和建筑安装工作的机械化程度将达到97％—98％。在七年计划规定的十一个重要动力工程建设地区，将建设生产装配式构件的辅助企业。单是实行这一措施，就会使每一建设工程的主要工作的准备时期缩短七、八个月。
    新华社莫斯科电　著名苏联科学院院士斯特鲁米林认为，在最近十五年内，苏联完全可以从电力工业的发展水平上赶上和超过美国。
    这位院士在今年第四十七期苏联“新时代”杂志发表文章指出，目前，苏联电力工业的发展水平为美国的三分之一。然而，苏联电力工业的发展速度在过去几十年中要比美国快好几倍。他说，与1927年比较，1957年，苏联发电站的发电能力增加为二十八点五倍，而美国发电站的发电能力在这期间只增加为四倍。在上述三十年间，苏联发电站的发电能力每十年平均增加205％，而美国只增加约58％。他说，由于苏联的发展速度要快得多，到1974年，它就可以从发电站的发电能力方面赶上和超过美国，如果不是更早一些的话。
    斯特鲁米林说，根据美国人制定的方案，在1955年到1980年的二十五年间，美国发电站的发电能力的增长速度将不会超过126.5％，或者平均每十年增加41％。然而，在和平发展的条件下，今后苏联发电能力的增长速度还可能高于过去几十年（包括战争年代在内）。他说，据苏联科学家的计算，在1977年以前，苏美两国的电力工业发展水平的对比大致将如下表（单位：一百万瓩）：
    年代　苏联　美国
    1957　四十八点四　一四三
    1967　一四八　二二六
    1972　二五七　二八四
    1974　三一四　三一○
    1977　四五○　三五七
    这就是说，到1972年，苏联的发电能力已十分接近美国的水平，而到1974年就将比美国多四百万瓩。
    新华社莫斯科电　苏联七年计划规定的重要动力建设工程之一——克列门楚格水电站，已经开始发电。它的第一台发电能力为五万七千二百瓩的涡轮机组，已于本月4日向附近的工业企业供应了第一批电力。到今年年底，预计还将有三台发电能力同样大的涡轮机组投入生产。
    克列门楚格水电站是苏联欧洲部分第二大河——第聂伯河上的水电站梯级之一。它的总发电能力为六十二万五千瓩，全部建成和投入生产以后，每年将可以生产二十五亿度电。由于建设克列门楚格水电站，在这里建成了一个面积为二十五万二千公顷的巨大水库。这个水库的储水量占第聂伯河每年平均流量的四分之一，它可以保证克列门楚格水电站全年不间断地发电，并可以改进第聂伯河下游各水电站——第聂伯水电站、第聂伯罗捷尔任斯基水电站和卡霍夫卡水电站的发电情况，使它们每年可以多生产七亿度的电力，同时还使得第聂伯水电站的发电能力（六十四万瓩）有可能再增加一倍。（附图片）
