Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 5th. Marosán, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee, delivered a report on amending the Party Constitution at the meeting of the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on the 4th.

    Marosán said that our party has three solid foundations: Marxist-Leninist ideology, policies serving the interests of the masses and progress, and organizational principles guaranteeing unbreakable unity.

    He said that the Party Constitution submitted to this congress for approval integrates the theoretical and practical experience of the Hungarian and international workers' movements over the decades. It is based on Lenin's doctrine and faithfully reflects the experience of the Hungarian workers' movement.

    Marosán said that our Party Constitution has been tested by history. The Party Congress in 1957 made amendments to various points and added new content. These amendments conform to Lenin's organizational principles, are helpful in the daily life and work of party organizations at all levels in practice, promote party building, strengthen party life, and will continue to be suitable as principles for determining the life of our party.

    Marosán then explained the amendments to the Party Constitution item by item. He said that before October 1956, sectarianists incorrectly interpreted and distorted the leading role of the Party, while revisionists denied the leading role of the Party. Our attitude on this issue is clear. At the Party Congress in 1957, we affirmatively stated that the Party can only accomplish its tasks and maintain its unity and firmness by waging an uncompromising struggle against all revisionist betrayals and dogmatic distortions.

    Marosán said that the experience of the past two years has proved that the Party Constitution adopted by the National Congress of the Party in 1957 is correct. We recommend that the Party Congress approve the various amendments to the Party Constitution made by the Congress. Marosán then said that democratic centralism is the basic principle, guiding ideology, method, and practice of our party. Now, democratic centralism has been fully realized in the life of the Party and the country. The Party has carried out a two-front struggle, developing intra-party democracy on the one hand, and consolidating the central leadership on the other. The experience of the past three years tells us that this approach is correct, centralism has been consolidated within the Party and also in the life of the country through the Party; at the same time, democracy has been further strengthened and deepened. Marosán said that we must improve the level of leadership. The accelerated progress of socialist construction, the socialist transformation of agriculture, the development of the cultural revolution, and the ideological struggle against nationalism, anti-Semitism, and religious worldviews all require improving the leadership level of party organizations at all levels. Therefore, we must consider how to further improve the cultivation and awareness of party cadres.

    Marosán emphasized that criticism and self-criticism must be carried out within the Party. We must trust the masses, pay constant attention to their opinions and demands, enhance their political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm, and strengthen the leadership and assistance to mass organizations.

    Marosán pointed out that with the great development of the cooperative movement this year, noteworthy achievements have also been made in developing party organizations in cooperatives. Party organizations in various states and districts have regarded the work of building party organizations in cooperatives as a key task in the struggle to consolidate production cooperatives. In January 1959, production cooperatives with grassroots party organizations accounted for 43.7%, which increased to 69.4% by October.

    Marosán said that we do not need to make any major revisions to the Party Constitution. However, in order to further improve party life, the Central Committee has several proposed amendments: (1) We propose adding the following under Section 7 of Article 3 of the Party Constitution: "Those who suppress critics must be subject to Party discipline sanctions"; (2) We believe that the content of Article 40 of the Party Constitution is inaccurate because, in practice, the power to approve the decisions of various Party committees has always been exercised by the relevant higher-level Party organizations. We propose that the Party Constitution stipulate: "Party committees at all levels shall be approved by the directly superior Party committee" to expand the scope of authority of Party committees at all levels to decide on issues; (3) Article 43 of the Party Constitution stipulates: "Party organizations in institutions and academic organizations have no right to supervise the leaders and leadership of institutions and academic organizations." We propose that the Party Constitution stipulate: "According to the instructions of the Central Committee, party organizations in various government ministries and certain central agencies have the right to supervise the work of the leaders and leadership of various government ministries and certain central agencies"; (4) Article 20 of the Party Constitution stipulates: "The Party is established according to the principles of region and production, and there can only be one Party leading body in an enterprise or a region." We propose that the Party Constitution stipulate: "This restriction may not apply with the approval of the Central Committee"; (5) It is recommended to make the following amendment to Article 13 of the Party Constitution: Members of the Discipline Inspection Commission (except the chairman) may also be held by party members who are not members of the Party committee; (6) It is recommended to increase the party membership dues for party members whose wages are above five thousand forints; (7) It is recommended to determine the number of members and alternate members of the Budapest City, State Committees, and Inspection Committees in Article 35 of the Party Constitution; (8) It is recommended to stipulate in the Party Constitution that the deadline for appealing a disciplinary action for a party member who objects to the action is six months. Marosán said that party life is rich and colorful, shining with rational optimism and the vision of the future. We must improve the level of the Party, because the higher the ideological and cultural level of our party members, the more united and stronger the Party will be, and the stronger its combat effectiveness will be, and the more steadily it will be able to lead the broad masses of the working people on the glorious road of communism!

### 马罗山作关于修改党章的报告

    马罗山作关于修改党章的报告
    新华社布达佩斯5日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、书记处书记马罗山在匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会4日会议上作了关于修改党章的报告。
    马罗山说，我们党有三个牢固的基础：马克思列宁主义思想、为群众利益和进步服务的政策以及保证牢不可破的团结的组织性。
    他说，提交这次代表大会批准的党章，综合了匈牙利和国际工人运动几十年来的理论和实践经验。它以列宁学说为基础，同时也忠实地反映了匈牙利工人运动的经验。
    马罗山说，我们的党章是受过历史考验的。1957年党代表会议就其中各点作了修改，并且添加了新的内容。这些修改是符合于列宁的组织原则的，在实践中有助于各级党组织的日常生活和工作，推进了党的建设，加强了党的生活，而且今后仍将适合于作为确定我们党的生活的原则。
    马罗山接着对党章的修改部分逐条作了说明。他说，在1956年10月以前，宗派主义者不正确地解释和歪曲了党的领导作用，而修正主义分子则否定了党的领导作用。在这一问题上，我们的态度是明确的。在1957年党的代表会议上，我们肯定地提出，党只有同一切修正主义背叛行为和教条主义的歪曲进行毫不妥协的斗争，才能完成党的任务，维护党的团结和坚定性。
    马罗山说，两年来的经验证明，1957年党的全国代表会议所通过的党章是正确的。我们建议党代表大会批准代表会议对党章所作的各种修改。马罗山接着说，民主集中制是我们党的基本原则、领导方针、方法和实践。现在在党和国家的生活中，民主集中制已经完全实现。党进行了两条战线的斗争，一方面发展了党内民主，另一方面又巩固了中央领导。三年来的经验告诉我们，这种做法是正确的，中央集权在党内巩固了，并且通过党在国家生活中也巩固了；同时，民主也得到了进一步的加强和深入。马罗山说，我们必须提高领导水平。社会主义建设的加速进行，农业社会主义改造，文化革命的发展以及对民族主义、反犹太主义、宗教世界观进行的思想斗争，都要求提高各级党组织的领导水平。因此，我们必须考虑怎样才能进一步提高党员干部的修养和认识水平。
    马罗山强调指出，党内必须展开批评和自我批评。必须信任群众，经常注意群众的意见和要求，提高他们的政治热情和劳动积极性，必须加强对群众团体的领导和帮助。
    马罗山指出，随着今年合作化运动的大发展，在发展合作社党组织方面也取得了值得注意的成绩。各州、区的党组织在巩固生产合作社的斗争中曾把合作社的建党工作当作一个重点。在1959年1月，建立了党的基层组织的生产合作社占43.7％，到10月份已增至69.4％。
    马罗山说，我们没有必要对党章作任何重大的修改。但是，为了进一步改进党的生活，中央委员会有几项修改建议：（1）我们建议在党章第三条第七节下补充：“压制批评者必须受到党纪的制裁”；（2）我们认为党章第四十条的内容不准确，因为，在实践过程中批准各党委会的权力过去都是由有关上级党组织行使的。我们建议党章规定：“各级党委会由直接的上级党委批准”，以扩大各级党委决定问题的职权范围；（3）党章第四十三条规定：“机关和学术机构的党组织无权监督机关和学术机构的领导人和领导”。我们建议党章规定：“根据中央委员会的指示，在政府各部和某些中央机关中的党组织有权监督政府各部和某些中央机关领导和领导人的工作”；（4）党章第二十条规定：“党是按照地区和生产的原则建立起来的，在一个企业或一个地区中只能有一个党的领导机关”。我们建议党章规定：“在中央委员会批准下，可以不受此限制”；（5）建议对党章第十三条作这样的修改：纪律委员会的委员（除主席外）也可以由不是党委会委员的党员担任；（6）建议增加工资收入在五千福林以上的党员的党费；（7）建议在党章第三十五条中确定布达佩斯市、州委员会和检查委员会委员和候补委员的人数；（8）建议在党章中规定：被处分的党员对处分有意见时上诉的期限为六个月。马罗山说，党的生活是丰富多采的，在我们党的生活中闪烁着合理的乐观主义信心和未来的远景的光芒。我们必须提高党的水平，因为我们党员的思想、文化水平越高，党就越统一强大，党的战斗力也就越强，也就更能稳步地领导广大的劳动群众在光荣的共产主义道路上前进！
