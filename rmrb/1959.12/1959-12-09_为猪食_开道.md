Using large quantities of green and coarse feed

To raise a large number of pigs, the first problem to solve is feed.

We know that pigs are omnivorous animals, and they have the ability to digest all kinds of feed. Therefore, not only grains and other refined feeds and various processed by-products can be used to feed pigs, but also wild grass, wild vegetables, tree leaves, wild fruits and their seeds can be used to fatten pigs. As the saying goes, "Pigs eat hundreds of kinds of grass, it depends on whether you can find them," which is the truth.

Using large quantities of green and coarse feed to feed pigs is a very important aspect of "paving the way" for pig feed in the future.

The sources of green and coarse feed are very wide. For example, planting alfalfa, fodder radish, fodder watermelon, and carrots and other high-yield and juicy feed can yield ten to twenty thousand catties per mu, and at least several thousand catties; there are even more wild forage grasses (various wild grasses, tree leaves, roots, etc.), which can be collected and stored in large quantities in the green season for the winter; bran, corn cobs, sunflower discs, cotton husks, etc. after processing agricultural and sideline products are also very good feed. According to our tests of more than 70 kinds of green and coarse feed, they generally have high nutritional value. For example, sweet lettuce, bitter lettuce, broom seedlings, thistle and willow leaves, etc., contain more than 3% crude protein, wild amaranth contains 14% protein, and they are also quite rich in minerals and several vitamins. The nutritional composition of wild grass seeds is equal to that of refined feed. Roughly calculated, a pig weighing eighty to one hundred catties needs about two to two and a half feed units of feed per day, which is equivalent to feeding five to six and a half catties of bran, or about ten to twelve catties of high-quality weeds.

Can cow dung be used to feed pigs? In principle, cow dung contains undigested feed, and the action of microorganisms in the rumen increases the variety of B vitamins and enhances the value of protein; at the same time, pigs have the habit of eating dung, so cow dung can promote pig growth and can replace part of the refined feed. The feeding amount of wet cow dung should account for 20% of the daily feed amount; generally, it is better to use the dung of healthy cattle fed with refined feed and green feed.

Acorns can also be used to feed pigs. They contain a lot of starch and sugar and can be used to make wine or as feed. Our experiments have proved that one catty of acorns with shells is equal to 0.67 catties of corn, and the feeding amount can reach about 20%, up to a maximum of no more than 35% of the daily feeding amount.

Refining coarse feed

Coarse feed can become soft and palatable after fermentation, while increasing protein, vitamins and other nutrients. This fermentation method is called "bian zao" in southeastern Shanxi. There are three types of "bian zao": large "bian zao", small "bian zao" and "bi hu zao". There are three methods for storing "bian zao" feed: cellar storage, jar storage and mat storage. According to our experiments, use ninety catties of grain husks, one hundred and forty catties of corn cobs, forty-five catties of acorns, and fifteen catties of distiller's yeast, grind them, mix them evenly, add one to two times the amount of water, pile them on the ground for a few hours to two days, steam them in a pot for two to three hours, then take them out and spread them out, cool them to 32 degrees Celsius, then sprinkle distiller's yeast, mix them evenly, and then put them into a jar, cover and seal tightly, ferment for about five days, and you can get six hundred catties of "bian zao" feed.

Drying and grinding are important methods for the masses to prepare coarse feed. There are two drying methods: one is shade drying, which is mostly used for green feed, because it can preserve nutrients; the other is sun drying, which is mostly used for old coarse feed, such as bean pods, chaff, cotton boll shells, sunflower disc leaves, cottonseed, and tree leaves. According to our experimental results, each mu of sunflower disc can provide food for one and a half half-grown pigs for one year. In the comparative experiment of feeding pigs with sun-dried and ground sunflower discs and millet bran, the average feed required to gain one hundred catties of weight was 1,695 catties for sunflower discs and 2,304 catties for millet bran. This proves that sunflower disc is an excellent feed. Because corn cobs are hard and difficult to absorb, they can be greatly changed after being ground in water. Its nutritional value is slightly less than that of millet bran or wheat bran, and fattening pigs can gain an average of 0.4 catties per day.

Stir-frying the feed can make the feed smell fragrant, pigs love to eat it, and it is easy to digest. We use stir-fried cotton boll shells in combination with green feed, using methods such as "coarse first, then green, feed less, and add frequently" to feed pigs, and the effect is very good. According to experimental analysis, although cotton boll shells have a high crude fiber content, their crude protein content is as high as 10.75%, and the mineral content is as high as 8.5%. This is a large amount of feed that can be used in cotton-producing areas.

In addition, in order to strengthen the utilization value of refined feed, we have also conducted experiments on saccharifying corn. After corn is saccharified by Aspergillus oryzae, its utilization efficiency can be increased by 25.4%. Fattening pigs are kept in dark pens for more than ten days before being sold, which is very much in line with the statement that "pigs eat their fill, lie down, rest, and fatten," so fattening is faster.

The green and coarse feeds that we have experimented with and analyzed can all have their nutritional value improved after processing. Of course, the collection and processing process requires a lot of labor, which increases the feed cost. However, with the reform of feeding tools, this problem can be gradually solved.

How to feed pigs well and fully

First, green feed has a large volume, but the pig's stomach capacity is limited. When pigs eat a lot of green feed, they feel full for a while, but according to the nutrients needed by pigs, it is not enough, so they are not resistant to hunger and cannot meet the needs for producing meat and oil. Therefore, silage feed should be processed and prepared, such as using cooking, fermentation and other methods to reduce the volume of green feed, and at the same time increase the number of times pigs are fed.

Second, coarse feed contains a lot of fiber and has poor palatability, which easily causes constipation. In order to increase the palatability and digestibility of coarse feed, modulation processes such as grinding and soaking should be adopted to promote palatability. At the same time, the possibility of digestion and utilization is increased because the contact area between the feed and the digestive juice is increased. When feeding coarse feed, it is necessary to properly match juicy green feed to avoid constipation. The ratio of juicy green feed to coarse feed is generally seven to three.

Third, piglets need a lot of nutrients due to their rapid growth and development, so they should be fed more refined feed, and efforts should be made to cultivate and improve the ability of piglets to utilize coarse feed.

Fourth, feed at fixed times, in fixed quantities, and at a fixed food temperature, and achieve "eight no-nos" (that is, no feeding late, no feeding early, no feeding too much, no feeding too little, no feeding cold, no feeding hot, no feeding thick, no feeding thin).

Fifth, use refined feed on the cutting edge. Feeding refined feed should be based on the pig's life history, and at some critical periods of growth, take the method of "grasping both ends and taking care of the middle" (that is, "refined at both ends and coarse in the middle"). For example, in my country, pigs are generally divided into three stages from small to large: piglet stage (within 30 catties), frame pig stage (30 catties to 100 catties), and fattening stage (40 to 50 days before slaughter, about 120 catties). In the first and third stages, due to rapid growth and more fat storage, refined feed should be added. In addition, pregnant sows should be fed refined feed in the first ten to twenty days of pregnancy, when the fertilized eggs have not yet been well fixed, in order to promote the development of the fertilized eggs after they are fixed and to improve the health of the sows. From twenty days after mating to one month before delivery, the fetus develops slowly, so green and coarse feed is the main food. One month before giving birth to piglets, it is the fastest period of fetal development, and an appropriate supply of refined feed is needed to ensure complete fetal development. These critical periods are the so-called "cutting edge" periods, and not only should they be fed well, but also management should be strengthened. People who know how to raise pigs should also find out various contradictions in production, distinguish between primary and secondary ones, and solve them.

Sixth, use seasoning methods to keep pigs' appetite strong and meet the large amount of nutrients needed for production. This is of great significance for improving some coarse feeds with poor palatability. (Attached pictures)

    为猪食“开道”

    大量采用青粗饲料
    大量养猪，首先要解决饲料问题。
    我们知道猪是一种杂食动物，它具有消化各种各样饲料的能力。所以，不仅粮食等精料及各种加工副产品能喂猪，就是野草、野菜、树叶、野果及其籽实也能把猪养肥。俗语说：“猪吃百样草，看你找不找”，就是这个道理。
    大量用青粗饲料喂猪，这是今后为猪食“开道”很重要的一个方面。
    青粗饲料来源很广。例如，栽种苜蓿、饲料萝卜、饲料西瓜和胡萝卜等高产多汁的饲料，亩产量可达到一二万斤，最低也有几千斤；野生饲草就更多了（各种野草、树叶、根茎等），可以在青绿季节大量采集、贮存过冬；农副产品经过加工的糠壳、玉米轴、葵花盘、棉壳等也是很好的饲料。根据我们化验的七十多种青粗饲料，一般都有很高的营养价值。如甜苣、苦苣、扫帚苗、刺儿菜和柳叶等，含粗蛋白质在3％以上，野苋菜的蛋白质达14％，它们含矿物质和几种维生素也相当丰富。野草子的营养成分等于精饲料。粗略计算，一头体重八十到一百斤的猪，一天约需二至二点五个饲料单位的饲料，这个数量，等于喂给五到六斤半麸皮，或相当于质量好的杂草十至十二斤左右。
    牛粪是否可以喂猪？从道理上讲，牛粪内含有未消化的饲料，同样由于在瘤胃中微生物作用增加了各种乙种维生素，提高了蛋白质价值；同时猪又有吃粪的习惯，所以牛粪可以促进猪生长，并能代替部分精料。湿牛粪的喂量，以占每日喂量的20％为宜；一般以使用喂精料与青饲料多的健康牛粪为佳。
    橡树子也可以喂猪，它含有大量淀粉与糖粉，可以制酒，也可作饲料。我们进行试验证明，一斤带壳橡树子等于零点六七斤玉米，喂量可达20％左右，最多不超过每日喂量的35％。
    粗料细作
    粗饲料经过发酵可以变得柔软可口，同时增进蛋白质、维生素等营养成分。这种发酵的办法在晋东南称为变糟。变糟方法有三种：大变糟，小变糟和秕糊糟。变糟饲料的储藏法有窖藏、缸藏和席囤藏三种。经我们试验，用九十斤谷壳、一百四十斤玉米轴、四十五斤橡树子、十五斤酒曲磨碎混匀，加水一到两倍拌匀，在地上堆闷几小时到两天，上锅蒸二至三小时，然后取出散开，凉到摄氏三十二度时再撒酒曲，拌匀后可入缸中加盖封严，发酵五天左右，可得变糟饲料六百斤。
    干燥、磨碎是群众调制粗饲料的重要方法之一。干燥方法有两种：一种是阴干，多用于青绿饲料，因为能保存营养；另一种是晒干，多用于老粗饲料，如豆角、秕壳、棉铃壳、葵花盘叶、棉籽、树叶。据我们试验结果，每亩葵花盘可供一头半大猪食用一年。用晒干磨碎了的葵花盘与小米糠养猪的对照试验：平均增重一百斤所需饲料，葵花盘需要一千六百九十五斤，小米糠需要二千三百零四斤。这证明葵花盘是一种优良饲料。玉米轴由于质地坚硬，难于吸收，但是经过水磨碾碎可以得到很大改变，它的营养价值略次于小米糠或小麦麸，育肥猪每日可以平均增重零点四斤。
    炒熟饲料，可以使饲料气味焦香，猪爱吃，也容易消化。我们利用炒熟加工处理的棉铃壳搭配青绿饲料，采用先粗后青，少喂、勤添等方法喂猪，效果很好。根据试验分析，棉铃壳虽有较高的粗纤维，但其粗蛋白含量高达10.75％，矿物质含量亦达8.5％。这是产棉区可以利用的大宗饲料。
    此外为了加强精饲料利用价值，我们还曾进行过糖化玉米试验。玉米经过黄曲霉糖化处理后，可以增加其利用效能的25.4％。肥猪在出售前十多天关在黑暗圈舍内喂养，很符合“猪吃饱躺倒歇着养膘”的说明，这样肥育较快。
    我们试验与分析过的青粗饲料经过加工处理，都可以提高其营养价值。当然，收集和加工过程花费劳力较多，使饲料成本变高。但是随着饲养工具的改革，这个问题可以逐步解决。
    怎样喂饱喂好
    第一，青饲料体积大，而猪胃容积有限。当猪吃大量青饲料后一时感觉饱了，但按猪需要的营养物质说却不够，所以不耐饿，也不能满足用以生产肉和油的需要。所以青贮饲料要加工调制，如采用煮熟、醱酵等办法缩小青饲料的体积，同时要增加喂猪的次数。
    第二，粗饲料含纤维多，而适口性差，容易引起便秘。为了增加粗饲料的适口性与可消化性，应采取磨细、泡软等调制过程，促进可口性，同时由于增加了饲料与消化液接触面积，增加了消化利用的可能性。喂粗饲料需要适当搭配多汁青饲料，以避免便秘。多汁青饲料与粗饲料搭配的比例，一般为七比三。
    第三，幼猪由于生长发育快，因而需要大量养份，应该喂比较精细些的饲料，并设法培育提高幼猪利用粗饲料的能力。
    第四，定时、定量、定食温，做到“八不喂”（即迟不喂、早不喂、多不喂、少不喂、冷不喂、热不喂、稠不喂、稀不喂）。
    第五，把精料使用在刀刃上。喂精料应按猪的生活史，在生长上的一些关键性时期，采取“抓两头顾中间”（即“两头精中间粗”）的方法。譬如，我国一般把猪从小到大分为三个阶段：小猪阶段（三十斤以内），架子猪阶段（三十斤到一百斤），肥育阶段（屠宰前四十至五十天，约一百二十斤左右）。一、三阶段由于生长快，储脂多，所以应给以补充精料。此外，妊娠猪在怀孕最初十到二十天，受精卵尚未很好固定，应加喂精料以促进受精卵固定后发育，并增进母猪健康。配种后二十天到分娩前一个月，胎儿发育较慢，以青粗饲料为主就行。临生小猪前一个月，是胎儿发育最快时期，需要适当供应精料，保证胎儿发育完全。这些关键性时期，正是所谓“刀刃子”时期，不但应喂得好，还应加强管理。会养猪的人也应该找出生产中的各种矛盾，分清主次加以解决。
    第六，用调味的办法，使猪经常保持食欲旺盛，满足生产所需的大量养分。这对于改进一些可口性差的粗饲料来说，有重大的意义。（附图片）
