In his report, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej spoke in detail about the development of Romania's national economy in 1960. He said that the tasks of the 1960 national plan were formulated based on the achievements already made by the working people. The six-year plan for the national economy is also being formulated.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej first spoke about Romania's achievements in developing the national economy in 1959. He said that, according to existing figures, the tasks of increasing production and labor productivity and reducing costs in this year's national economic plan will be fulfilled and overfulfilled. Some enterprises have completed or overfulfilled their 1959 plan tasks.

The Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Construction and Building Materials, the Ministry of Consumer Goods Industry, and the Forestry Bureau have made excellent achievements in terms of savings. This year, state farms have overfulfilled the task of providing the state with wheat, corn, and other agricultural products.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that the State Planning Committee, based on the Party's intention to vigorously develop industrial and agricultural production, expand the commodity circulation of the socialist commercial sector, and expand the number of employees in the national economic sector, has formulated the draft national plan for 1960.

The national income in 1960 will increase by 12.5% ​​compared to 1959. On the basis of better use of existing production capacity and some new projects to be put into production, industrial production next year will increase by 14%.

The increase in major industrial products in 1960 will reach the following levels: electricity will reach 7.7 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 14%; iron ore - 1.4 million tons, an increase of 27%; steel - 1.7 million tons, an increase of 22%; steel products - 1.14 million tons, an increase of 51%; the production of drilling equipment will increase by 63%; tractors will reach 15,000 units, an increase of 36%; cotton textiles will reach 235 million square meters, an increase of 9%; meat will increase by 18%; sugar will reach 325,000 tons, an increase of 41%; edible oil will double this year, reaching 115,000 tons.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that the total industrial investment in the coming year will account for 59% of the total investment in the national economy, of which nearly four-fifths will be used to develop the basic sectors of the national economy: electricity, fuel, metallurgy, machine manufacturing, chemical, fiber and rubber processing and other industrial sectors. Some important enterprises and workshops will be put into production in 1960.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej said that agricultural investment will reach 4.4 billion lei, an increase of more than 25% over this year. This will be used to expand agricultural machinery and equipment, provide more chemical fertilizers and pesticides, improve the soil, and first of all, expand the irrigated area.

The draft plan stipulates that in 1960, industry will supply agriculture with 10,750 tractors, 12,000 seeders, 5,000 combine harvesters and other agricultural machinery. The draft also stipulates the production increase targets for wheat, corn, sugar beet and sunflower in 1960.

At the end of his report, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized the need to improve the leadership of local state organs and party organizations over the national economy.
