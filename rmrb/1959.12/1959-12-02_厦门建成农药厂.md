    Xiamen Builds Pesticide Factory
    The Xiamen City Xinglin Pesticide Factory, which began construction in July of this year, has recently been completed and put into production.
    This factory uses fish vine roots (commonly known as "luteng"), which are abundant in tropical and subtropical regions, as raw materials to produce pesticides. The rotenone emulsion made from this raw material has a strong insecticidal effect (two to three times stronger than DDT or 666) and is very effective against vegetable white butterfly worms, citrus malignant pests, cotton aphids, fruit aphids, tea caterpillars, etc.

    厦门建成农药厂
    今年七月动工兴建的厦门市杏林农药厂，已在最近建成投入生产。
    这个厂是用盛产于热带和亚热带地区的鱼藤根（俗称芦藤）作原料来制造农药的。用这种原料制成的鱼藤精乳剂，杀虫效力强（比滴滴涕或六六六强两三倍），对蔬菜白蝶虫、柑桔恶性害虫、棉蚜虫、果蚜虫、茶毛虫等，都有特效。
