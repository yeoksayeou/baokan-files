In five canyons there are five waterfalls, like five roaring tigers, carving out five streams in the deep mountains, noisy and bustling, each going its own way. Sometimes they hide beneath the chaotic rocks, sometimes they rush through the wild bamboo thickets, sometimes they hum softly, swaying the dense aquatic plants, and sometimes they rage against the green stone cliffs. Countless boulders have been worn into pebbles, paving a green path for themselves, flowing here for who knows how many years, even the withered branches and banyan trees cannot remember clearly.

One day a Communist Party member came, and the clear streams sparked his thoughts: the land, ah, often suffers from drought, transportation, ah, relies entirely on carrying on backs and shoulders. Before we were all suffering slaves, united we overthrew the landlords, before we were very poor here, united we are creating happiness. If we lead the clear streams up the high mountains, there will be abundant rice here, if we organize the five streams, they will become a large river.

He went to the commune with his new enlightenment, and told the Party about his thoughts, and the Party encouraged his boldness: "Go do it, as a task of the Party!" He told the masses this new idea, and the masses jumped up and cheered, the entire commune organized three thousand warriors to subdue the five waterfalls.

He led the team off, the bright red flag pointed the way for him, going to the barren mountains, the barren mountains thanked him, going to the fields, the fields blessed him. The motherland sent hundreds of tons of dynamite, leveling five high mountain tops, filling five deep canyons, locking up five ferocious waterfalls.

A dam was built on the mountainside, and a man-made lake appeared in the clouds, where five clear streams converged, and a large river wound around the mountain and flowed into the distance. The workers also sent the latest water turbine, installing the brightest eyes in the mountains, a line of poles lined up and went in all directions, sending the stars into every window.

Thus, a lake in the clouds appeared here, with thousands of tangerine trees on the shore, and ten thousand plum trees, speedboats speeding and blowing long whistles on the high mountains, like spaceships transporting in the high sky. Thus, thousands of streams swept away the drought, the poor mountain areas changed their appearance, Jiangnan rice blossomed here, and silver ducks from Beijing came to settle here.

Man-made long river, ah, man-made large lake, you are a product of the Great Leap Forward, you reflect the heroic figure of the commune, you are filled with the happiness of the commune members.

And that Communist Party member is setting off again, a red flag leading the heroic team, thousands of miles of high mountains are waiting for them, their smiles are dyeing the clouds on the mountaintop red.

    五瀑河之歌
    雁翼五个峡谷里有五个瀑布，像五只咆哮的老虎，在深山里闯出了五条小溪，吵吵嚷嚷，各走各的路。有时它们隐藏在乱石下面，有时在野竹丛中奔流，有时摇着密密的水草低吟，有时又在青石壁上发怒。多少巨石被冲成了卵石，给自己铺成了绿色的路，不知在这里流了多少年月，连那枯枝黄桷树也记不清楚。有一天来了个共产党员，清溪引开了他的思路：土地呵，常常受着干旱，运输呵，全靠背背肩负。以前我们全是受苦的奴隶，组织起来我们打倒了地主，以前我们这里很穷，组织起来我们创造着幸福。如果把清溪引上高山，这里就会丰产稻谷，如果把五条小溪组织起来，就会变成一条大河。他带着新启示走向公社，把他的思想向党讲述，党鼓励了他的大胆：“去干吧，作为党的任务！”他把这新思想告诉给群众，群众高跳起来欢呼，全公社组织起了三千勇士，去把那五个瀑布治服。他领着队伍出发了，那鲜艳的红旗给他指路，走向荒山，荒山向他致谢，走向田野，田野向他祝福。祖国送来了百吨炸药，削平了五个高高的山头，填平了五个深深的峡谷，锁住了五个凶恶的瀑布。山腰间筑成了拦水大坝，云里出现了人造大湖，五条清溪在这里会师，一条大河绕山奔向远处。工人又送来最新的水轮机，给山区安上最亮的眼珠，一排排线杆列队走向八方，把星斗送进了每一个窗户。于是这里出现了云中大湖，岸上金桔千株，红梅万树，汽艇高呼着长笛开上高山，像飞船在高空中运输。于是千条溪水横扫干旱，贫穷的山区改变了面目，江南水稻在这里开花，北京的银鸭到这里落户。人造的长河呵，人造的大湖，你是大跃进的产物，你映着公社英雄的身姿，你盛满了公社社员的幸福。而那位共产党员又出发了，一杆红旗领着英雄的队伍，千里高山正在把他们等待，他们的笑颜染红了山顶的云雾。
