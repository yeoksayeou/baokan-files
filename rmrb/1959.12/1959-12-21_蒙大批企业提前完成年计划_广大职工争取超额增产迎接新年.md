Ulaanbaatar Dispatch: The broad masses of workers in the Mongolian People's Republic are enthusiastically carrying out socialist production emulation, and factories and enterprises in various regions are continuously reporting good news of completing this year's production plans ahead of schedule. The workers are welcoming the production tasks of 1960, the final year of the Three-Year Plan, with full confidence.

The workers of the Bulgan Flour Mill, Mongolia's first flour mill, actively carried out labor emulation in response to the call of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party to meet the domestic flour needs in the next few years, and overfulfilled this year's production plan forty-two days ahead of schedule. This mill also reduced production costs and saved 1.2 million tugriks (Mongolian currency) in funds.

The Match Factory in Sukhbaatar City, Mongolia's second industrial city, completed 101% of its annual production plan twenty days ahead of schedule, and increased the country's revenue by 100,000 tugriks.

After completing this year's production plan twenty days ahead of schedule, the workers of the Adenchuluun Coal Mine in Choibalsan Province are also striving to produce more coal to welcome the New Year. One production team of this coal mine increased its daily coal output from the original twenty tons to thirty-six tons.

The food factories under the handicraft cooperative system in many provinces have also completed their production plans ahead of schedule. For example, the Handicraft Cooperative in the Former Khangai Province completed its annual plan one month ahead of schedule, improved labor efficiency, and saved funds, creating favorable conditions for completing the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The food processing plants in Uvs Province and Bayan-Ölgii Province have all achieved this year's production plans ahead of schedule. The thirty-seven small creamery workshops in Bayan-Ölgii Province produced more than 5,700 tons of cream, completing the production plan ahead of schedule, and the quality of the cream is very good.

1960 is the final year of Mongolia's Three-Year Plan. At present, while striving to overfulfill this year's plan, the workers across Mongolia are confidently preparing to meet even greater tasks next year and are working hard to complete the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

　　蒙大批企业提前完成年计划
    广大职工争取超额增产迎接新年
    本报乌兰巴托20日电　蒙古人民共和国的广大职工热烈开展社会主义生产竞赛，各地工厂企业不断传来提前完成今年生产计划的捷报。职工们满怀信心地迎接三年计划最后一年——1960年的生产任务。
    蒙古第一个面粉厂——布拉干面粉厂职工们响应蒙古人民革命党发出的在最近几年内满足国内面粉需要的号召，积极开展劳动竞赛，提前四十二天超额完成了今年的生产计划。这个厂还降低了生产成本，节约了一百二十万图格里克（蒙币）的资金。
    蒙古第二个工业城市苏赫巴托尔市火柴厂提前二十天完成了年度生产计划的101％，并且为国家增加了十万图格里克的收入。
    乔巴山省阿登楚伦煤矿的职工们在提前二十天完成今年的生产计划后，还在争取生产更多的煤炭迎接新年。这个煤矿的一个生产队由原来日采煤二十吨提高到三十六吨。
    许多省的手工业合作系统所属食品工厂也提前完成了生产计划，例如前杭爱省手工业合作社已经提前一个月完成了年度计划，并提高劳动效率，节约了资金，为提前完成三年计划创造了良好条件。乌布苏省和巴彦乌列盖省的食品加工厂都分别提前实现了今年的生产计划，巴彦乌列盖省的三十七个小型奶油坊生产五千七百多吨奶油，提前完成生产计划，奶油的质量都很好。
    1960年是蒙古三年计划的最后一年。现在，蒙古全国职工在争取超额完成今年计划的同时，正满怀信心地准备迎接明年更大的任务，为争取提前完成三年计划而努力。
