    Yicheng Cottonseed Oil Extraction Rate Exceeds 20%
    (By our report) After the Yicheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee issued the call to all oil processing industry workers in the county to "increase cotton oil production by two jin per hundred jin of cottonseed" in mid-October, all local oil mills in the county responded to the call. By November 30th, the average oil extraction rate of the eighty-three local oil mills in the county had stabilized at over 20%. Every hundred jin of cottonseed produced 2.6 jin more oil than at the end of October. Due to the in-depth development of the oil increase production campaign in the county's oil mills, output and oil extraction rates have been increasing month by month, ten-day period by ten-day period, and day by day. In early November, daily output reached 62,520 jin, and the oil extraction rate rose to 18.33%; in mid-November, daily output rose to 71,000 jin, and the oil extraction rate rose again to 18.83%; in the last ten days of the month, daily output increased to 100,160 jin, and the oil extraction rate rose sharply to 20.1%.

    翼城棉籽出油率超过20％
    本报讯　山西翼城县土榨棉籽出油率达20％以上。
    10月中旬，中共翼城县委和县人委向全县油脂加工业职工发出了“百斤棉籽增产二斤棉油”的号召以后，全县各土榨油厂普遍响应了这个号召。到11月30日，全县八十三座土榨油厂，平均出油率已稳定在20％以上。每百斤棉籽比10月底多产了二点六斤油。这个县各油厂由于增产油脂运动的深入展开，产量和出油率出现了月月高，旬旬高，日日高的局面。11月上旬日产达六万二千五百二十斤，出油率上升为18.33％；中旬日产量上升为七万一千斤，出油率又上升为18.83％；下旬日产量又增为十万零一千六百斤，出油率直线上升为20.1％。
