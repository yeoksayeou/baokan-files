    Ten Thousand Boats Compete to Sail Upstream
    By the Chinese Communist Party Hongze County Committee, Jiangsu Province
    Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, and on the foundation of the Great Leap Forward of 1958, our county's aquatic production this year, like that of the rest of the country, continues to be in a situation of continuous leap forward. Especially since August, the Party's great call to oppose Rightism, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy has inspired the 34,000 fishermen of the entire lake. "Everyone is boosting their morale, everyone is striving to be the best, every tool is achieving high yields, and every boat is achieving a great harvest" has become the revolutionary fighting spirit of the vast fishermen of Hongze Lake. They put forward the battle slogan of "Fighting hard in the fourth quarter, one season surpassing three seasons, completing and overfulfilling the annual fish production of 40 million catties, and making the whole lake a sea of red," and launched a new and vigorous production upsurge. From January to November, the entire lake has produced more than 26 million catties of fish and shrimp, exceeding last year's output by 30%. It is expected that with the addition of the December output and the 15 million catties from the 56,000 mu of inland pond aquaculture and harvesting, the completion of the annual planned output is entirely possible.
    The situation of our county's fishery output this year is: output is rising steadily, each month surpassing the previous month, and each season surpassing the previous season. For example, the average monthly output in the second quarter increased by more than double that of the first quarter; the third quarter increased by 212% compared to the second quarter; and the average monthly output in October and November increased by another 3.7% compared to the third quarter. The great leap forward in output since the third quarter fully demonstrates that this is the result of deeply implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.
  Oppose Rightism and Launch a New Upsurge in Production
    Right-leaning conservative thinking is a stumbling block to continuous leap forward. Because it was resolutely removed in the new production upsurge, fish production here has more than tripled. Our county's fish production from January to July was very low. The reason for the low output was the interference of Right-leaning thinking. Under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we firmly grasped the key of opposing Rightism and boosting morale, vigorously launched mass movements, organized on-site visits, carried out high-yield competitions, and held two ten-thousand-person rallies of fishermen from the entire lake, criticizing Right-leaning conservative thinking and digging out its roots. This was a profound education for the cadres and fishermen of the entire lake. Some people took the initiative to criticize their own lack of effort, saying: "Others are full of effort, have high output, strive to be the best, wear the flower of glory, win the red flag, and become famous throughout the lake; our tools and people are the same, but our thinking is not right, and we lack effort, so we have fallen behind and become Guan Yu once (meaning we blushed once). Next time, we must strive to catch up." In particular, through the third-quarter distribution conference, people further understood the relationship between developing production and the income of commune members. In this distribution, units upstream averaged more than 100 yuan per household, while those downstream only received more than 30 yuan per household. This situation deeply moved the downstream units. After the distribution, they held commune member meetings overnight, summarized the reasons for low production, studied leap forward measures, and sent battle reports to the upstream units: "We lost this time, we will learn from you, and we will compete again at the next conference." For example, the Sanhe Brigade of the Sanhe Commune was a low-yield unit at the evaluation conference. After the meeting, its daily output soared by more than double.
          Establish Models at Every Level and Seize Red Flags at Every Level
    "Establish models and seize red flags" is a good way to deepen the high-yield competition movement. With the appearance of models, the masses have clear goals to learn from, catch up with, and surpass. The production methods, indicators, measures, effort, and output of the models all attract the surrounding masses to emulate. For example, Hu Yusheng, a model of large-net fishing, goes to the lake every day before dawn to produce, and other production boats follow suit, setting sail for the lake without falling behind. After this competition movement was launched, it gained great momentum and was filled with enthusiasm. A model commune, a model brigade, and a model team were established throughout the lake. There are five types of tool models: large weirs, large nets, hooks, trawls, and small tools. Communes, brigades, and production teams all have unit models and boat and tool models. The county, communes, and teams have established more than 1,000 models in total. Establishing models at every level and seizing red flags greatly promotes production. The cadres and members of Shunhe Commune, the county's model unit, put forward the determination to "unite as one, strive to be the first with all tools, keep the model flag, and always be the best in the lake." In order to fully exploit the labor potential, this commune, in just a few days, rushed to manufacture 121 sets of drawstring nets, 963 hook boats, and 223 small "ka" boats, solving the problem of more than 1,000 laborers lacking tools, and increasing daily output from more than 60,000 catties to 100,000 catties, with a maximum of more than 135,000 catties in one day. Qiu Faqi, the county's small tool model, has caught more than 5,000 catties of fish in just 50 days since the fourth quarter, more than double the output of ordinary small tools.
          Technical Innovation and Multi-Tool Combined Operation
    In the past, single-tool production was more common in Hongze Lake fishing. Generally, fishermen only had the production skills of using one or two tools. Those who used nets could not use drawstring nets or trolling hooks, those who used weirs could not cast nets, and those who used "ka," small "zeng," or small dredges did not know how to use other tools at all. The applicable scope of various tools is limited. Using only one type of tool often leads to missed production. Without changing this single-tool production method, it would be very limited to improve output. Therefore, we put forward the slogan of "one boat with four tools, multi-method production." The vast fishermen warmly agree with doing so. However, some people worry that they don't know how to use the tools, and some people think that "one boat with four tools is both wasteful and ties up funds. Even if they are made, we won't know how to use them, so it's better not to make them." How to solve these ideological problems? We used the method of calculating carefully to find the high-yield case of the ninth and tenth production teams of the Hongsheng Brigade of the Shunhe Commune, which had one boat with four tools, to convince them. In addition to the main tool production, the daily output of these two production teams' boats with combined tools was around 100 catties every day. If the auxiliary tools of each boat could produce 50 catties per day, it would be possible to produce more than 10,000 catties in a year. After this calculation, everyone's thinking was clear. We immediately mobilized the fishermen of the entire lake to learn from each other, carry out large-scale technical instruction, with teams leading teams, boats leading boats, and people leading people. After three months, we basically overcame the technical hurdle. The vast majority of production boats have achieved one boat with four tools and combined operation. The technical problems that some people were worried about were easily solved.

    万人千帆争上游
    中共江苏洪泽县委员会
    在党的总路线光辉照耀下，在1958年大跃进的基础上，今年我县的水产生产和全国各地一样，仍然是一个继续跃进的形势。特别是在8月份以来，党的反右倾，鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的伟大号召，振奋了全湖三万四千个渔民。“人人鼓干劲，个个争上游，具具齐高产，船船大丰收”，成为洪泽湖广大渔民的革命斗志。他们提出了“奋战四季度，一季超三季，完成和超额完成全年渔产四千万斤，全湖满堂红”的战斗口号，并且掀起了一个新的轰轰烈烈的生产高潮。全湖1月至11月已生产鱼、虾二千六百多万斤，超过去年产量30％，预计加上12月份的产量和五万六千多亩的内塘养殖捕捞产量一千五百万斤，完成全年计划产量是完全可能的。
    今年我县渔业产量的形势是：产量节节上升，下月超上月，一季胜一季。如第二季度平均月产量比第一季度增长一倍多；第三季度比第二季度又增长212％；10月和11月平均月产量比第三季度再增长3.7％。从第三季度以来产量的大跃进看，充分表明，这是深入贯彻八届八中全会精神的结果。
  反掉右倾，掀起生产新高潮
    右倾保守思想是继续跃进的绊脚石。由于在新的生产高潮中坚决地搬掉了它，这里的鱼产量猛增两倍以上。我县1至7月的鱼产量是很低的。低的原因是右倾思想的作祟。在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召下，我们紧紧的抓住了反右倾、鼓干劲这条纲，大搞群众运动，组织现场参观，开展高产竞赛，和召开两次全湖渔民万人大会，批判了右倾保守思想，挖出了它的老根。这对全湖干部和渔民是一次深刻的教育，有的人主动批判自己干劲不足说：“人家干劲足，产量高，争了上游，戴上光荣花，夺了大红旗，全湖闻了名；我们工具和人一样，就是思想不对头，干劲不足，才落个下游，做了一次关老爷（意思是红了一次脸），下次一定争取后来居上。”特别是通过第三季度分配大会，人们进一步认识了发展生产和公社社员收益的关系。这次分配，上游单位平均每户分得一百多元，下游的每户仅分了三十多元。这种情况对下游单位激动很深，他们在分配后连夜开社员会，总结低产原因，研究跃进措施，向上游单位递战表：“这次输了，向你们学习，下次大会再比高低”。如三河公社的三河大队，在评比大会上是低产单位，会后，日产量陡增两倍以上。
          层层树标兵，层层夺红旗
    “树标兵，夺红旗”，是高产竞赛运动深入发展的一种好方法。有了标兵的样子，群众就有了学、赶、超的明确目标；标兵的生产方法、指标、措施、干劲、产量等等，都吸引着周围群众去效仿。如大网标兵胡玉胜，每天天不亮下湖生产，其他生产船就跟着扬帆下湖，一步不让。这样竞赛运动掀起以后，声势很大，干劲冲天。全湖共树立一个标兵公社，一个标兵大队，一个标兵小队。树立工具标兵的有大簖、大网、挂钩、绞网、小型工具等五种。公社、大队、生产队都有单位标兵和船、具标兵。县、公社、队共树立标兵一千多个。层层树标兵，夺红旗，对生产促进很大。县标兵单位顺河公社全体干部、社员提出了“全社一条心，万具齐争先，保住标兵旗，永做全湖第一名”的决心。为了充分发挥劳动潜力，这个社在短短几天里，就赶制拉筋一百二十一盘，挂钩九百六十三船，小卡二百二十三船等等，解决了一千多个劳力缺工具的困难，日产量由六万多斤提高到十万斤，最高一天捕十三万五千多斤。县小型工具标兵丘发启从四季度以来，仅五十天就捕鱼五千多斤，超过一般小型工具的产量一倍以上。
          技术革新，实行多具套作
    过去在洪泽湖捕鱼，单一化工具生产是较普遍的，一般渔民只有用一具或两具的生产技术，用网就不会拉筋、淌钩，下簖的不会张网，下卡、下小曾、用小罱的，其他工具一样也不会用。各种工具的适应范围是有一定局限性的，单用一种工具，往往有误生产。不改变这种单一工具的生产方式，提高产量就很有限。因此，我们提出“一船四具，多法生产”的口号。广大渔民是热烈赞成这样做的。但有些群众顾虑有具不会用，也有人认为“一船办四具，既浪费又积压资金，办了也不会用，不如不办”。怎样解决这些思想问题呢？我们用算细账的办法，找出顺河公社洪胜大队第九、第十生产队一船四具的高产事例来说服他们。这两个生产队每船除了主具生产外，套作工具每天的日产量都在一百斤左右。如果每船的附具每天都能生产五十斤的话，一年就可生产一万多斤。通过这样一算，大家思想通了。我们紧接着发动全湖渔民互相学习，大搞技术传授，以队带队，以船带船，以人带人，经过三个月，就基本上闯过了技术这一关，绝大多数的生产船都做到了一船四具，套作生产。一些人所顾虑的技术问题，就迎刃而解了。
