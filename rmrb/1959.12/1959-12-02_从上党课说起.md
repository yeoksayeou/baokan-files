Starting with Party Lessons

With the development of socialist construction, the tasks of rural Party organizations are becoming heavier and the requirements for Party members are becoming higher. Therefore, regularly conducting political and ideological education among the broad masses of Party members to improve their political consciousness and ideological level has become an indispensable task. The enormous effect achieved by the Zhouzhuang Commune (formerly Zhouzhuang Township) in adhering to Party lesson education for five years is a good illustration of this.

Some commune Party organizations do not deny the importance of strengthening ideological education, but they lack resolute measures and are preoccupied with production tasks, effectively relaxing ideological education for Party members. Consequently, these Party organizations cannot help but fall into a situation where the busier they are, the less they can conduct ideological education for Party members. Without regular ideological education, the ideological awareness and work ability of Party members cannot be quickly improved, and they cannot better complete the tasks assigned by the Party.

How can this situation be escaped? On the one hand, it requires a good arrangement of time for production and study, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to pay attention to ensuring that the content of the study is relevant to the current situation. The Zhouzhuang Commune Party organization often takes the work at that time and in that place as the theme, combining it with explanations of basic Party knowledge, the Party's principles, policies, and lines, the position, viewpoints, thoughts, and methods that Party members should have, etc. This not only improved the theoretical and policy level of Party members, but also improved their business ability. It not only improved political awareness and class consciousness but also solved the problems of Party members in actual work. This method is undoubtedly a good one.

    从上党课说起
    随着社会主义建设事业的发展，农村党组织的任务越来越重，对于党员的要求也越来越高。因此，在广大党员中经常地进行政治思想教育工作，提高他们的政治觉悟和思想水平，就成为一件必不可少的事。周庄公社（原周庄乡）五年来坚持党课教育所取得的巨大效果就是一个很好的说明。
    有些公社党组织并不否认加强思想教育工作的重要意义，但他们缺少坚决的措施，忙于生产任务，实际上放松了对党员进行思想教育。于是，这些党组织不能不陷入了这样一种境地：工作愈忙就愈不能对党员进行思想教育，党员得不到经常性的思想教育，思想觉悟和工作能力就不能很快地提高，从而就不能更好地完成党交给的任务。
    究竟怎样才能摆脱这种境地呢？一方面要求很好地安排生产和学习的时间，一方面也要注意学习的内容要切合时效。周庄公社党组织经常以当时、当地的工作为主题，结合讲解党的基础知识，党的方针、政策、路线，党员应有的立场、观点、思想、方法等等，这样既提高了党员的理论、政策水平，又提高了业务能力，既提高了政治觉悟、阶级觉悟，又解决了党员在实际工作中的问题。这种方法无疑是一种好的办法。
