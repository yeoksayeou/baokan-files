    Victory of the Policy of Simultaneously Implementing Self-Sufficiency Production and Commodity Production
    ——Achievements of the Weihe People's Commune in Developing Diversified Economy and Establishing Commodity Production Bases
    中共黑龙江省委财贸部　中共牡丹江地委　中共尚志县委　工作组调查报告
    The Weihe People's Commune in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, is located between the main peak of the Huyue Ridge in the Wanda Mountains. Surrounded by mountains, it is home to 4,200 households and 16,300 people. Since the establishment of the People's Commune in September 1958, it has only been a year, but it has already displayed a picture of agriculture and diversified economy flying together.

          From Harvesting One Autumn to Harvesting Ten Autumns
    The Weihe Commune is located in a mountainous area with dense forests, crisscrossing rivers, fertile soil, and abundant grasslands. It not only has the conditions to develop grain crops, cash crops, animal husbandry, and fisheries, but also abounds in precious medicinal materials such as ginseng, deer antler, and musk, which are famous at home and abroad, as well as various mountain products and local specialties. People compare this place to "Golden River, Mountain of Treasures." In 1957, Weihe's agricultural production had already made great progress, but the development of diversified economy was not fast enough. On average, two households raised one pig, and one household raised only two chickens, and the income from mountain products was also very small. Therefore, some farmers said: "Living in a treasure trove, sideline occupations are not well done." Some agricultural cooperatives also wanted to actively develop diversified economy, but they were afraid of affecting grain production, fearing that they would "end up with nothing." In 1958, the horn of the Great Leap Forward sounded throughout the country, and everyone in Weihe was filled with fiery enthusiasm. They were determined to turn Weihe into a prosperous and happy mountain village. After a great debate on whether agriculture and diversified economy could achieve an all-round leap forward, the masses concluded that "walking on one leg leaps, walking on two legs leaps even further." Based on unified thinking and understanding, the Weihe Township Party Committee, in accordance with the wishes of the masses, formulated an all-round leap forward plan with grain as the key link and the development of diversified economy, and put forward the battle cry of "grasping agriculture tightly, grasping sideline occupations fiercely, and running industries by the whole people to achieve three million (annual output value)." The entire mountainous area was boiling. Commune members, unafraid of high mountains and deep waters, and undeterred by the cold weather, surveyed resources everywhere and developed diversified economy production. As a result, the planning targets for diversified economy were repeatedly exceeded, from an average income of 30 yuan per farmer to 40 yuan, then to 60 yuan, and finally to 70 yuan. But at that time, a prominent contradiction was encountered: the organizational form of advanced agricultural cooperatives was not adapted to the comprehensive and large-scale development requirements of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. For example, the Beixing, Heshun, and Jingzhou advanced cooperatives had extremely rich mountain resources, but due to the inability to allocate labor, they picked agriculture and abandoned sideline occupations. The Huayi and Sanhe advanced cooperatives each had large grasslands of hundreds of miles, but they were unable to develop animal husbandry on a large scale. The Zhicheng cooperative had a large area of linden forest, which could raise 500 boxes of bees, but only raised more than 100 boxes, and had no strength to develop further. Some advanced cooperatives also had large areas of oak forests and water surfaces, suitable for silkworm raising and fish farming, but due to insufficient manpower, material resources, and financial resources, these rich resources were not rationally utilized. As the masses said: "Grasping the mountains delays the fields, grasping the fields delays the mountains, working on both fields and mountains, people are few and strength is weak." What to do? The Party's general line of building socialism illuminated the road forward for the people of Weihe, and people's minds were liberated. Liu Xiangyun, secretary of the Victory Cooperative Party Branch, and Wei Changfu, director of the Huayi Cooperative, proposed to the township Party committee in April 1958 to implement large-scale cooperation by region and district. The township Party committee adopted their opinions and divided the 18 advanced cooperatives in the township into five cooperative zones, each directly controlled by a member of the township Party committee, and made unified arrangements for the production and labor force of each advanced cooperative in the zone. In this way, the contradiction of competing for resources and labor was initially eased, but the problem was not fundamentally solved. Therefore, the masses further deliberated on merging into larger cooperatives. At this time, the Party put forward the call to establish people's communes. After heated discussions by all members of the agricultural cooperatives, the Weihe People's Commune was formally established on September 2, 1958.
    The people's commune, freed from the shackles of small collectives, is like a steed galloping freely across the vast mountains and fields. Here, the saying "ten harvests a year" (note) has been circulating for a long time, but in the era of small-scale peasant economy, nine out of ten harvests were abandoned. In the era of advanced cooperatives, although the strength was much greater than before, it still did not achieve "ten harvests out of ten." In 1958, when the people's commune was established, it was the eve of the autumn harvest, and the unprecedentedly good corn, soybeans, rice, and millet were about to be harvested; various local specialties in the mountains were also in the annual peak season of production, and missing the opportunity would be wasted on the ground. According to the characteristics of the people's commune's large organizational scale, wide scope of activities, and strong leadership, the commune Party committee made unified arrangements for the labor force of the entire commune, formed five production brigades, and launched a full-line assault, ensuring not only the autumn harvest and the collection of mountain products, but also the basic construction of farmland. The autumn harvest task was completed in full within 20 days, 15 days ahead of previous years. In 25 days, local specialties worth 250,000 yuan were seized, realizing "ten harvests out of ten." Then, in the severe winter season, the task of deep plowing 25,000 mu of land was completed in 20 days; in the past, the delivery of requisitioned grain had to be dragged on until the spring plowing of the following year, but this year it took less than a month to complete the requisition task of 3,490 tons; at the same time, an "iron and steel production army" was organized. As a result, by the end of 1958, the leap forward plans for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries were comprehensively overfulfilled. The total grain output increased by 30.07% compared with 1957, and the average output per mu increased from 270 jin in 1957 to 360 jin, with an average of 1,381 jin of grain per person; the income from diversified economy other than agriculture increased by 92% compared with 1957, with an average income of 100 yuan per person, and the variety of products expanded from 171 in 1957 to 232; the output value of farm tool repair, rice milling, power generation, wine making, sugar making, brick and tile and other industries, which were started from scratch, increased by 1.8 times compared with 1957. The masses sang: "In the past, one harvest a year, gold and silver treasures were lost all over the mountains, the commune harvests 'ten harvests' a year, a great harvest all over the mountains and fields!"
    The realization of the comprehensive leap forward plan in 1958 further inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of Weihe. They demanded that a comprehensive development of "five industries" be achieved in 1959. At the beginning of 1959, the Weihe Commune Party Committee, in accordance with the national plan and the principle of rationally utilizing resources and developing production according to local conditions, formulated a plan for taking grain as the key link, developing diversified economy, expanding commodity production, and realizing the comprehensive development of "five industries." Among the 17 management districts in the commune, 11 management districts have fertile soil, abundant water sources, and flat terrain, and implement the policy of developing grain as the main focus, combined with the development of diversified economy; 6 management districts have very rich mountain, water, and grass resources, and implement the policy of attaching equal importance to agriculture and sideline occupations. At the same time, according to the different conditions of each district and team, different varieties of key operations are determined. For example, some districts and teams focus on developing mountain sideline occupations; some districts and teams focus on developing animal husbandry; some districts and teams focus on developing fisheries; some districts and teams focus on developing sericulture. In addition, the policy of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains, and using the mountains to support the mountains" was also implemented, and wild plant cultivation bases were established, planting 15 mu of fritillary bulbs, 1,000 ginseng plants, 300 mu of strawberries, and edible mushrooms, tree ears, etc., and achieving a combination of collection and cultivation, a combination of protection and utilization, and a combination of current production and long-term construction. The ideal of "making the best use of the land and making the best use of everything" that people have long pursued has begun to be realized in the people's commune.
    Agricultural production here is harvested once a year, and the frost-free period is short. On the one hand, because there is a lot of land and few people, it has always been difficult to persist in carrying out diversified economy on a large scale during the busy farming season; but on the other hand, because it is harvested once a year, there is a relatively long slack farming season, which is a favorable opportunity to develop diversified economy. After communization, the organizational scale has increased, and it is possible to make full use of the seasonal conditions of busy and slack farming to comprehensively develop production, and to act according to the seasons. According to this characteristic of the people's commune, the Weihe Commune Party Committee, based on the policy of taking grain as the key link and developing diversified economy, adopted long-term planning, seasonal adjustments, focusing on agriculture during the busy farming season; focusing on sideline occupations during the slack farming season; and when both agriculture and sideline occupations are busy, taking a reasonable arrangement according to the proportion, and combining perennial arrangements with seasonal allocation, combining professional team production with mass seasonal assaults, and combining fixed division of labor with temporary allocation, so as to ensure the comprehensive development of agricultural production and diversified economy. From January to September 1959, a total of five mass sideline production assault movements were organized. September in the slack farming season is the peak season for mountain products. The commune Party committee put forward the call of "working hard and skillfully for 30 days, and all kinds of mountain products will be brought down the mountain," and organized a collection army of more than 4,000 people, collecting mountain products worth more than 100,000 yuan in 15 days.
    After communization, there are more ways to produce, so it is possible to absorb all kinds of people to participate in all kinds of production, arrange labor according to people and things, those who can go up the mountain go up the mountain, those who can go down the water go down the water, those who are suitable for agriculture do agriculture, and those who are suitable for sideline occupations do sideline occupations, so as to give play to the role of all kinds of people and turn many "idle people" into production experts. There are currently 1,070 people in the commune participating in diversified economy production, 60% of whom are elderly people, disabled people, and women who could not participate in agricultural production in the past. For example, Xing'an Village has a total of 261 people. In addition to children under the age of 15, there are 155 adults. In the era of advanced cooperatives, only 68 people participated in labor. Now that a breeding farm has been set up, the number of people participating in labor has increased to 149, accounting for 96% of adults.
    On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the people of Weihe achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in 1959 after eight months of intense fighting. The grain yield per mu reached 400 jin, realizing the target set by the "National Agricultural Development Program" eight years ahead of schedule, with an average of 1,596 jin of grain per person. The income from diversified economy during this period in 1959 increased by 34% compared with the same period in 1958. Among them, the number of live pigs increased by 40%, the number of poultry increased by more than four times, the number of sheep increased by 1.3 times, the number of rabbits increased by five times, the number of bees increased by three times, the number of fruit trees increased by 50%, and the number of dairy cows increased by 53%. In 1959, a total of 57 medium-sized and small-sized factories and workshops such as farm tool repair, rice milling, power generation, fertilizer, food, clothing, brick and tile, and graphite were expanded and newly built, and the total output value from January to August increased by 35.7% compared with the same period in 1958. This is the brilliant achievement made by the Weihe People's Commune in the year since its establishment.

          Establish Commodity Production Bases
    Before 1957, production here was mainly for self-sufficiency, and there was little commodity production. In 1957, the average commodity value produced by each farmer here was only 38 yuan. The amount of non-staple food commodities produced locally was very small, and even the meat, fish, and vegetables consumed in the local market had to be supplied from other places. In 1957, 400 pigs and 3 million jin of vegetables were transferred from other places. Although the production of pigs, poultry, vegetables, etc. made great progress in 1958, the commodity rate was still not high because the living standards of the commune members improved and the consumption of non-staple foods they needed increased. How to quickly increase the commodity rate and provide a large number of commodities to the state? On this issue, a struggle between two ideas was launched at the beginning of 1959. One idea advocated mainly relying on commune members' families to develop commodity production such as pigs and poultry; the other idea advocated implementing the policy of combining public and private efforts, with collective production as the main focus and commune members' family production as the auxiliary, and establishing specialized commodity production bases directly operated by the commune. The commune Party committee supported the latter idea, believing that the method of organizing commune members' families to raise pigs and poultry was necessary and should be actively promoted, but relying on this method alone could not guarantee the stable growth of commodity volume or the strengthening of the collective economic strength of the commune. Therefore, specialized commodity production bases should be established while actively developing mass production. This is the most active and reliable way to ensure the continuous growth of commodity volume.
    There are some villages here with abundant natural resources, suitable for developing diversified economy, but with barren soil. In the past, in order to solve the problem of food, they had to devote their main efforts to self-sufficient grain production, and they were unable to make full use of resources and develop commodity-based diversified economy production. After communization, because it was possible to plan production in a unified way and the financial strength was great, it was possible to take out some money to invest in the development of long-term production undertakings, implement specialized management, and develop commodity production. Therefore, in the spring of 1959, the commune invested more than 100,000 yuan in several production teams with barren land, low income for commune members, and unusually rich natural resources to establish eight specialized commodity production bases for animal husbandry, fisheries, beekeeping, sericulture, vegetables, and fruits, initially forming a commodity production base network for the commune. These eight bases all focus on one or two varieties and implement comprehensive management, with self-sufficiency in grain, oil, and feed.
    After the commune had commodity production bases, production that could not be carried out in the past was carried out, and the development that was slow became faster, especially expanding the quantity of commodities. Xingbei Village, surrounded by mountains on all sides, has more than 100 kinds of mountain products, wild feed all over the mountains and fields, and there are many sunny mountain slopes and fresh air. It has never suffered from livestock and poultry epidemics. There are also large areas of linden forests for honey collection around it, which is a good place to develop animal husbandry, mountain products, and beekeeping. The commune has turned this village into a specialized breeding base, focusing on raising pigs, bees, chickens, and planting fruit trees, and vigorously developing pigs, poultry, and mountain products. In 1958, this village only had 33 pigs and 330 chickens. Now there are pigs in the pens, chickens all over the mountains, bees flying all over the sky, and fruit trees all over the mountains. In 1959, the agricultural and sideline output value of this village increased by 2.5 times compared with 1958, and the commodity volume increased by 3.5 times. Another Xiangyang animal husbandry base has more than 300 hectares of grassland, growing dense sheep grass, and is also close to the Ant River, focusing on raising pigs, cattle, and sheep, combined with raising poultry and bees, and self-sufficiency in grain. In 1959, the income from agriculture and sideline occupations can reach 37,000 yuan, an increase of two times compared with 1958. The linden honey produced by the commune's beekeeping base is pure in quality, white in color, and fragrant in taste, and is famous in domestic and foreign markets. In the past, advanced cooperatives had a small range of honey sources, and honey collection was restricted by region. After the commune established a specialized beekeeping base, it transferred and raised bees in different places within the scope of the entire commune. Wherever there are more honey sources, they go there to raise bees. Now the number of bee colonies has increased from 814 at the beginning of 1959 to 3,000. Sanrenban Village in Xinmin Management District has 800 hectares of oak forest around it. The commune established a sericulture farm here, focusing on raising silkworms and combining raising pigs and rabbits. The oak silkworms released in 1959 suffered five natural disasters in a row, but because the commune was strong and had strong disaster resistance, it finally successfully released oak silkworms in this area at 45 degrees north latitude, collecting 1.5 million cocoons. A fish farm was established in Xinli Village, located in the middle of the Weisha River and the Ant River, raising 1 million fish from scratch, and also raising 120 dairy cows and beef cattle. In addition, specialized horticultural farms and forest farms were also established. In the past, vegetables could not be self-sufficient, but now they are evergreen in all seasons. The masses said: "Multiple industries are really better than one industry, mountain valleys have become treasure troves, pigs, chickens, bees, and rabbits have become helpers, producing commodities and also producing grain!"
    The experience of this commune proves that establishing commodity production bases directly operated by the commune is the best form for developing commodity production and increasing commodity volume. Although the commodity production bases of this commune are newly built, they have already provided commodities worth 830,000 yuan to the state in the first eight months alone, an increase of 50% compared with the same period in 1958, and 60% more than the total commodity volume in 1957, including grain.

          Poor Mountain Valley Becomes Rich Mountain Valley
    Developing diversified economy and expanding commodity production have created very favorable conditions for gradually realizing agricultural modernization and commune industrialization. The public accumulation of the Weihe Commune reached 356,000 yuan in 1958, an increase of 2.3 times compared with 1957, and is expected to reach 701,000 yuan in 1959, an increase of 97% compared with 1958. In 1958 and 1959, four tractors (standard units), four trailers, one large thresher, one diesel engine, nine water wheels, and a total of 469 feed crushers, grass cutters, and flour milling machines were purchased. Six medium-sized factories and five small power stations were established. People here have already used various agricultural tools and daily necessities produced by local factories; they use mechanical power to harvest, thresh, and mill rice, and use tractors to cultivate fields; half of the management districts in the commune have lit up electric lights. In this mountain valley, which is known for its desolation and loneliness, farmers who have worked for a day study culture and talk about the past and the present under the electric lights. It can be imagined that on this basis, the realization of agricultural modernization and commune industrialization is not so far away.
    Developing diversified economy and expanding commodity production have turned poor mountain valleys into prosperous townships. In 1958, the distribution to commune members increased by 69% compared with 1957. Adding the income from household sideline occupations, the average income per household was 411 yuan, and the average income per person was 110 yuan. In 1959, the distribution to commune members increased by 31% compared with 1958. Adding the income from household sideline occupations, the average income per household can reach 524 yuan, and the average income per person is 157 yuan.
    As the income of commune members increased, the purchasing power also increased greatly, and life became rich and colorful. In 1958, the sales of the commune's supply and marketing cooperative increased by 38% compared with 1957. From January to August 1959, it increased by 58.5% compared with the same period in 1958. The savings deposits of commune members were 20,482 yuan in 1957, and increased to 82,483 yuan by the end of August 1959, an increase of more than three times.
    The cultural and recreational life of commune members is even richer and more colorful. The commune has a cultural palace and eight clubs. Each management district has amateur theater troupes. During festivals and holidays, commune members can enjoy the performances of their own theater troupes. There are various newspapers, magazines, and popular books in the 17 libraries for commune members to read. There is also a cinema and a radio station with 210 loudspeakers. After work every day, commune members gather in groups of three or five around the loudspeakers to listen to the news and moving music.
    Endemic diseases that have plagued people for a long time (Kashin-Beck disease, goiter, Keshan disease) have been controlled. After liberation, especially after the establishment of the people's commune, a hospital was established, with four health clinics, and the number of medical personnel increased to 27. Each production team or natural village also has non-full-time health workers, forming a commune-wide medical and health care network, which fundamentally prevents the occurrence of endemic diseases. Many households who had planned to move no longer move, and those who had moved away have returned one after another.
    In the year of the Great Leap Forward and the year after the establishment of the people's commune, the changes in Weihe are tremendous, but this is just the beginning of a beautiful socialist life, and an even more beautiful picture is being displayed in front of the commune members. The Weihe Commune Party Committee plans to increase the grain yield per mu by 30% in 1960 compared with 1959, increase the output value of diversified economy by 40%, take out more commodities to support the country, and turn Weihe into a more beautiful mountain township.

    实行自给性生产和商品性生产并举方针的胜利
    ——苇河人民公社发展多种经营建立商品生产基地的成就
    中共黑龙江省委财贸部　中共牡丹江地委　中共尚志县委　工作组调查报告
    黑龙江省尚志县苇河人民公社，位于完达山脉虎越岭主峰之间，在群山环抱中，住着四千二百户人家，一万六千三百口
  人。从1958年9月成立人民公社以来，时间刚刚一年，就展示了一幅农业和多种经营比翼双飞的图画。
          从收一秋到收十秋
    苇河公社地处山区，森林茂密，河流纵横，土质肥沃，草原丰盛，不仅有条件发展粮谷作物、经济作物和畜牧业、渔业，而且盛产驰名国内外的人参、鹿茸、麝香等珍贵药材和各种山产、土特产。人们把这个地方比作“金钱河，万宝山”。1957年苇河的农业生产就已经有了很大的发展，但多种经营还发展的不快，平均两户才养一头猪，一户才养两只鸡，山产收入也很少。因此，有的农民说：“住在宝中宝，副业没搞好。”有些农业社也想积极发展多种经营，但怕影响粮食生产，怕“弄的鸡飞蛋打两头空”。1958年全国响起了大跃进的号角，苇河每一个人的心里，都充满了火热的干劲，他们一心要把苇河变成繁荣幸福的山乡。经过关于农业和多种经营能不能全面跃进大辩论以后，群众给这次辩论作出结论说：“一条腿走路跳，两条腿走路跃。”在统一思想认识的基础上，中共苇河乡党委根据群众的愿望，制定了以粮为纲发展多种经营的全面跃进规划，提出了“农业抓的紧，副业抓的狠，工业全民办，实现三百万（年产值）”的战斗口号。整个山区沸腾起来了。社员们不怕山高水深，不畏天寒地冻，到处勘察资源，开展多种经营生产，结果多种经营的规划指标一再被突破，由原来每个农民平均收入三十元增加到四十元，又增加到六十元，最后增加到七十元。但当时却遇到了一个突出的矛盾：高级农业合作社的组织形式和农、林、牧、副、渔的全面大发展要求不相适应了。比如：北兴、合顺、景州三个高级社，山区资源极为丰富，但由于劳动力调配不开，拣了农业，扔了副业。化一、三合两个高级社，各有百里方圆大草原，但无力大量发展畜牧业。志诚社有大片椴树林，可饲养五百箱蜜蜂，但只养了一百多箱，再无力发展了。还有些高级社有大片柞林和水面，适于放蚕、养鱼，却因为人力、物力、财力不足，没有把这些富饶的资源合理利用起来。正如群众所说：“抓山误了田，抓田误了山，山田一齐干，人少力量单。”怎么办？党的建设社会主义的总路线给苇河人民照亮了前进的道路，人们的思想解放了。胜利社党支部书记刘向云和化一社主任魏长富，在1958年4月间就向乡党委提出了分片、分区实行大协作的建议。乡党委采纳了他们的意见，将全乡十八个高级社划为五个协作区，每区由一名乡党委委员直接掌握，对区内各高级社的生产、劳动力也作了统一安排。这样一来，争资源争劳动力的矛盾初步缓和了，但问题还没有根本解决。于是，群众又进一步酝酿合并大社。正在这时候，党提出了办人民公社的号召，经过各个农业社全体社员的热烈讨论，1958年9月2日苇河人民公社正式成立了。
    摆脱了小集体束缚的人民公社，就如骏马在广阔的山野上纵情飞奔。这里很久就流传着“一年十秋”的说法（注），但在小农经济时期，十秋倒有九秋扔。高级合作社时期，虽然比从前力量大得多了，但也没有作到“十秋十收”。1958年成立人民公社的时候，正是秋收的前夜，长得空前好的玉米、大豆、水稻、谷子就要开镰；山上的各种土特产也正是一年一度的生产旺季，错过时机就会废弃于地。公社党委根据人民公社组织规模大、活动范围广、领导力量强的特点，把全社劳动力做了统一安排，组成了五路生产大队，全线突击，既保证做好秋收和采集山产，又进行农田基本建设。在二十天内全面完成了秋收任务，比往年提前十五天。在二十五天内夺取了价值二十五万元的土特产，实现了“十秋十收”。接着又在严寒的季节里，以二十天的时间完成了两万五千亩深翻地的任务；过去送交征购粮要拖到第二年的春耕前，而这一年却只用了不到一个月的时间，就完成了三千四百九十吨的征购任务；同时还组织了“钢铁生产大军”。结果到1958年末全面超额完成了农、林、牧、副、渔各项生产跃进计划。粮食总产量比1957年提高30.07％，每亩平均产量由1957年的二百七十斤提高到三百六十斤，每人平均占有粮食一千三百八十一斤；农业以外的多种经营的收入比1957年提高92％，每人平均收入一百元，生产品种由1957年的一百七十一种扩大到二百三十二种；白手起家办起来的农具修配、制米、发电、制酒、制糖、砖瓦等工业产值，比1957年提高了一点八倍。群众歌唱道：“从前一年收‘一秋’，金银财宝满山丢，公社一年收‘十秋’，满山遍野大丰收！”
    1958年全面跃进规划的实现，更加鼓舞了苇河人民的革命干劲，他们要求在1959年实现“五业”全面大发展。1959年初，苇河公社党委根据国家计划和合理利用资源，因地制宜发展生产的原则，制定了以粮为纲、发展多种经营、扩大商品生产、实现“五业”大发展的规划。在全社十七个管理区中有十一个管理区土质肥沃，水源充足，地势平坦，实行以发展粮食为主、结合发展多种经营的方针；有六个管理区山、水、草资源非常丰富，实行农副业并重的方针。同时，根据各区、队的不同条件，确定不同品种的经营重点。例如有的区、队着重发展山产副业；有的区、队着重发展畜牧业；有的区、队着重发展渔业；有的区、队着重发展养蚕业。此外，还贯彻了“靠山吃山，吃山养山”的方针，建立了野生植物培育基地，种植了平贝十五亩、人参一千棵、草梅三百亩和元蘑、木耳等，并且作到了采集和培育相结合，保护和利用相结合，当前生产和长远建设相结合。人们长久追求的“地尽其力，物尽其用”的理想，在人民公社里开始实现了。
    这里的农业生产是一年一收，无霜期短，一方面因为地多人少，历来很难作到在农忙时期坚持大搞多种经营；但另一方面又因为一年一收，有比较长的农闲时期，这又是发展多种经营的有利时机。公社化后，组织规模大了，能够充分利用农忙、农闲的季节条件全面发展生产，作到因时制宜。根据人民公社的这个特点，苇河公社党委本着以粮为纲、发展多种经营的方针，采取了长年规划，季节调整，农忙集中抓农业；农闲集中抓副业；农、副都忙的时候，就采取按比例合理安排的办法，同时以常年安排和季节调配相结合，专业队伍生产和群众季节性突击相结合，固定分工和临时调配相结合等办法，保证农业生产和多种经营全面发展。1959年1月到9月，共组织了五次群众性副业生产突击运动。农闲的9月份，正是山产旺季，公社党委提出“苦干巧干三十天，各种山产都下山”的号召，组织了四千多人参加的采集大军，在十五天内共采集了价值达十万多元的山产。
    公社化后，生产门路多了，就能够吸收各种各样的人参加各种各样的生产，因人因事制宜安排劳动力，能上山的上山，能下水的下水，适于搞农业的搞农业，适于搞副业的搞副业，这样就发挥了各种人的作用，把许多的“闲人”变成了生产能手。全社现有一千零七十个人参加多种经营生产，其中有60％的人是过去不能参加农业生产的老年人、残废人和妇女。比如兴安屯一共有二百六十一口人，除了十五岁以下的小孩以外，成年人是一百五十五人，在高级合作社的时候，仅有六十八人参加劳动，如今办起养殖场以后，参加劳动的人就增加到一百四十九名，占成年人的96％。
    苇河人民在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年经过八个月的紧张战斗，夺得了农、林、牧、副、渔的全面大丰收。粮食亩产达到了四百斤，提前八年实现了“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标，每人平均占有粮食一千五百九十六斤。1959年这个期间的多种经营收入比1958年同一时期增加了34％。其中生猪增加40％，家禽增加四倍多，羊增加一点三倍，兔增加五倍，蜂增加三倍，果树增加50％，奶牛增加53％。1959年还扩建和新建了农具修配、制米、发电、肥料、食品、服装、砖瓦、石墨等中小型工厂和作坊共五十七个，1月到8月的生产总值比1958年同期增长了35.7％。这是苇河人民公社成立一年来所取得的辉煌成果。
          建立商品生产基地
    在1957年以前，这里主要是自给性的生产，商品性生产是不多的。1957年这里每个农民生产的商品价值平均不过三十八元。当地生产的副食品商品量很少，甚至当地市场消费的肉、鱼、蔬菜还要靠外地供应。1957年由外地调进猪四百头、蔬菜三百万斤。1958年猪、禽、菜等生产虽然有了很大发展，但因为社员生活提高了，本身需要的副食品消费量增加了，因此商品率仍然不高。怎样迅速提高商品率，给国家提供大量的商品呢？对这个问题，在1959年年初展开了两种思想斗争。一种思想主张主要依靠社员家庭发展猪、禽等商品生产；另一种思想主张实行公私并举的方针，以集体生产为主，以社员家庭生产为辅，建立由公社直接经营的专业商品生产基地。公社党委支持了后一种主张，认为组织社员家庭养猪和家禽的办法是必要的，应当积极提倡，但光依靠这个办法，不能保证商品量的稳定增长，不能保证公社集体经济力量的壮大，因此应当在积极发展群众性生产的同时，建立专业性的商品生产基地，这是保证商品量不断增长的一个最积极可靠的办法。
    这里有一些自然资源丰富、适合发展多种经营、但土质瘠薄的村落，过去为了解决吃粮问题，不得不以主要力量从事自给性的粮食生产，无力充分利用资源，发展商品性的多种经营生产。公社化以后，由于能够统一筹划生产和资金力量大，便能够拿出一些钱投资发展长远性的生产事业，实行专业经营，发展商品生产。因此公社在1959年春天，对几个土地瘠薄、社员收入低而自然资源异常丰富的生产队，投了十几万元资金，建立了畜牧、渔、蜂、蚕、蔬菜、水果等八个专业商品生产基地，初步形成了公社的商品生产基地网。这八个基地都以一、两个品种为主，实行综合经营，粮、油和饲料自给。
    公社有了商品生产基地以后，过去不能办的生产办起来了，发展慢的变快了，特别是扩大了商品数量。四周环山的兴北屯，有一百多种山产品，满山遍野都是野生饲料，而且向阳山坡多，空气清新，历年没闹过畜禽瘟疫，周围还有大片可供采蜜的椴树林，是发展畜牧业和山产、养蜂的好地方。公社将这个屯变成了一个专业养植基地，以养猪、养蜂、养鸡、种植果树为主，大力发展猪、禽和山产。1958年这个屯只有猪三十三口。鸡三百三十只，现在已经是猪满圈，鸡满山，蜜蜂满天飞、果树满山坡了。1959年这个屯的农、副业产值比1958年增加了两倍半，商品量增加了三倍半。另一个向阳畜牧基地，有三百多公顷草原，长着茂密的羊草，还靠近蚂蚁河，以饲养猪、牛、羊为主，结合养禽、养蜂，粮食自给自足。1959年农副业收入可达三万七千元，比1958年增加两倍。这个公社养蜂基地出产的椴树蜜，质纯、色白、味芬芳，驰名国内外市场。过去高级合作社因蜜源范围小，采蜜受到区域的限制，公社建立专业养蜂基地以后，在全社范围内移地放养，哪个地方蜜源多，就到哪里去放养，现在养蜂已由1959年初的八百一十四箱发展到三千箱。新民管理区三人班屯，周围有八百公顷柞树林，公社在这里建立了养蚕场，以养蚕为主结合养猪、养兔。1959年放养的柞蚕曾连续遭受五次自然灾害，但由于公社力量大，抗灾力量强，终于在这北纬四十五度的地方成功地放养了柞蚕，收茧一百五十万粒。在位于苇沙河、蚂蚁河中间的新利屯建立了养鱼场，从无到有养起一百万尾鱼，还养有奶牛和菜牛一百二十头。此外，还建立了专业的园艺场和林场。过去蔬菜不能自给，现在作到了四季长青，群众说：“多业真比一业强，山沟变成万宝囊，猪鸡蜂兔成了帮，又出商品又打粮！”
    这个公社的经验证明：建立由公社直接经营的商品生产基地，是发展商品生产，增加商品量的最好形式。这个公社的商品生产基地虽都是新建，但仅仅前八个月已经为国家提供的商品价值就达到了八十三万元。比1958年同期增加50％，比1957年包括粮食在内的全部商品量还多60％。
          穷山沟变成富山沟
    发展多种经济，扩大商品生产，给逐步实现农业现代化和公社工业化，创造了十分有利的条件。苇河公社的公共积累1958年达到三十五万六千元，比1957年增加二点三倍，1959年预计达到七十万一千元，比1958年增加97％。1958年和1959年购买了拖拉机四台（标准台）、拖车四台、大型脱谷机一台、柴油机一台、水车九台和饲料粉碎机、铡草机、磨面机等共四百六十九台，建立了六个中型工厂和五个小型发电站。这里的人们已经用上了当地工厂生产的各种农具和日用品；使用机械动力收割、脱谷、制米，用拖拉机耕田；全社有一半的管理区点上了电灯，在这素称荒凉寂寞的山沟里，劳动一天的农民在电灯下学习文化，谈古论今。可以想见，在这个基础上实现农业现代化和公社工业化，已经不是多么遥远的事了。
    发展多种经营，扩大商品生产，使穷山沟变成了富裕乡。1958年社员分配，比1957年提高69％，加上家庭副业收入，每户平均收入四百一十一元，每人平均一百一十元。1959年社员分配，比1958年提高31％，加上家庭副业收入，每户平均收入可达五百二十四元，每人平均一百五十七元。
    社员收入增加了，购买力也大大上升了，生活丰富多彩了，1958年公社供销部的销售额比1957年提高38％。1959年1月到8月份又比1958年同期提高了58.5％。社员们的储蓄存款，1957年是两万零四百八十二元，到1959年8月末就增加到八万二千四百八十三元，增加三倍多。
    社员们的文化娱乐生活，更加丰富多彩。全社设有一个文化宫和八个俱乐部，各个管理区都有业余剧团，每逢佳节、假日，社员们可以欣赏到自己剧团的演出。在十七个图书室中设有各种报刊、杂志和通俗的书籍，供社员阅读。还有一个影院和一个广播站，有二百一十个广播喇叭，每天劳动之余，社员都三五成群，围着喇叭收听新闻和动人乐曲。
    长期折磨人的地方病（大骨节、大粗脖、克山病），已经被控制住了。解放后，特别是人民公社化后，建立了一处卫生院，四处卫生所，医务人员增加到二十七名，各个生产队或自然屯也都设有不脱产的保健员，形成一个全社性的医疗保健网，这就从根本上制止了地方病的发生。许多曾经打算搬家的户，现在也不搬了，已经搬走的又纷纷回来了。
    大跃进一年来，人民公社成立后一年来，苇河的变化是巨大的，但这只是美好的社会主义生活的开始，一幅更加美丽的图景正展示在社员们的面前。苇河公社党委计划1960年粮食亩产比1959年提高30％，多种经营产值提高40％，拿出更多的商品支援国家，把苇河变成更加美好的山乡。陈冰岩　刘景华阎景春　訾宪章王成志　陶　源执笔
