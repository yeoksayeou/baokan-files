    False Masks and Old Policies
    Xinhua News Agency Commentary
    1959 was a year of great misfortune for U.S. imperialism in Latin America. The victory of the Cuban People's Revolution on January 1st opened a new page in the anti-American movement in Latin America. Since then, the tide of anti-American struggle has swept across Latin America uncontrollably. This struggle is still surging forward and continuing to develop, and its intensity can be seen from the Panamanian people's demand for the return of sovereignty over the Canal and the Puerto Rican people's unyielding anti-American demonstrations.
    How to deal with this situation? This is a question that the anxious Washington is racking its brains over. A "National Advisory Committee on Latin American Affairs" chaired by Secretary of State Herter was established and began its activities, and its task is said to be to "readjust" the U.S. policy toward Latin America.
    The United States has been clamoring to "adjust" its policy toward Latin America for several years. But despite the clamor for "adjustment," the opposition it has encountered has become increasingly fierce. The fundamental problem is that the so-called "adjustment" of the U.S. ruling group is nothing more than putting on a more deceptive painted skin on its rejected policy of enslaving and invading the people of Latin American countries.
    It is worth noting that the United States has recently tried its best to put on a "smiling face" towards some Latin American countries. In August this year, Secretary of State Herter talked at length about the "principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of American countries" at the Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Americas. In October, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on relations with Cuba, declaring that the United States "adheres to the policy of non-interference in Cuba's internal affairs." But what about the actual actions of the U.S. government? The focus of U.S. intervention in Latin America this year is precisely Cuba. The United States regards the victory of the Cuban revolution as a thorn in its side. The United States openly harbors Cuban counter-revolutionary bandits on its own soil, and uses U.S. soil and neighboring countries of Cuba as bases to continuously instigate counter-revolutionary armed rebellions and sabotage activities in Cuba. Even while U.S. officials were singing the praises of "non-interference," the U.S. government repeatedly sent notes to Cuba, coercing Cuba to abandon its land reform plan, otherwise it would reduce Cuba's share of sugar exports to the United States, and so on.
    The United States also issued a statement when the Panamanian people held fierce anti-American demonstrations, expressing its willingness to "seek mutually satisfactory solutions to outstanding issues" between the two sides. However, in the so-called "friendly negotiations" between the United States and Panama, it blatantly threatened the Panamanian people not to take actions against the U.S. occupation of the Panama Canal Zone.
    The United States, which has always supported dictatorial regimes in Latin America, has recently stated that it "opposes dictatorship" and hopes to implement so-called "representative democracy." One of the two agenda items arranged by the United States for the Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Americas held in August this year was the issue of "the effective implementation of representative democracy and respect for human rights." Fair public opinion in Latin America pointed out at the time that the real purpose of the United States in doing so was to vilify the Cuban revolutionary regime for "not having representative democracy" and to organize intervention activities against Cuba. The obvious fact is that the Cuban Batista dictatorial regime originally supported by the United States has fallen like many other dictatorial regimes, and the United States is currently continuing to fully support some of the remaining dictators.
    Economic "aid" is the "sugar-coated bullet" that the United States is constantly strengthening to launch at Latin American countries. In 1958, the total amount of U.S. "aid" and loans to Latin America reached 594 million U.S. dollars, while in 1957 it was 337 million U.S. dollars, and in 1955 it was 100 million U.S. dollars. Complete statistics for 1959 are not yet available, but for Chile and Mexico alone, loans and "aid" amounted to 315 million U.S. dollars. In addition, the United States also decided this year to join the Inter-American Development Bank and continue to peddle "economic stabilization plans" to some countries with economic difficulties through the International Monetary Fund.
    The increase in "aid" is the strengthening of plunder and control. The result of Argentina's acceptance of the "economic stabilization plan" is: currency devaluation, wage freezes, skyrocketing prices, the long drive straight in of American economic and political forces, and the intensification of domestic economic and political crises.
    As the movement of the Latin American public against military bases imposed by the United States and demanding a reduction in the burden of arms expansion flourished, the U.S. State Department announced at the end of November that it "supports the proposal to limit Latin American armaments." The U.S. State Department's statement also said, "This has long been the attitude of the U.S. government." However, who doesn't know that the United States has been strengthening its war preparations in Latin America for many years. This year, the United States has not only increased its troops in existing bases, but also established many new bases in Argentina and other countries. It has held a series of military exercises and nuclear explosion tests in the Latin American region. And just after the U.S. State Department announced its "support for the proposal to limit Latin American armaments," on December 7th, news from Washington said that the United States would give some submarines and naval vessels to Argentina, Chile, Peru and other countries.
    It is especially worth noting that in the U.S. State Department's so-called "support for arms limitation" statement, it also mentioned the need to "strengthen the inter-American collective security system." Hidden behind this is the conspiracy to organize an "international police force" that has not yet succeeded. The United States has been active this year in organizing this force to overthrow the current regime in Cuba and suppress national movements in other countries, but it has not received a response at the Inter-American Conference in June and the Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Americas in August. However, U.S. congressmen have long advocated the establishment of this force in the name of the "Inter-American collective system," and Congress has decided to allocate more than 30 million U.S. dollars for this purpose.
    Obviously, this set of so-called "non-interference," "anti-dictatorship," "friendly negotiations," "economic aid," and even "arms limitation" of the U.S. ruling group is nothing more than a false mask, a "smile" that is false, and "swords" that are real.
    All this is only to cover up its intensified suppression of the national democratic movement in Latin America and its intensified economic plunder of Latin America. Of course, the result of doing so cannot be anything else but that the tide of Latin American people opposing U.S. imperialism will become even more turbulent and high.

    假面具和老政策
    新华社记者述评
    1959年是美帝国主义在拉丁美洲大大倒霉的一年。今年1月1日古巴人民革命胜利，为拉丁美洲开辟了反美运动的新的一页。在这以后，反美斗争的浪潮就不可遏止地席卷整个拉丁美洲。这一斗争现在还在汹涌澎湃地继续发展，其激烈程度可以从巴拿马人民要求收回运河主权和波多黎各人民进行不屈的反美示威上得到说明。
    怎样对付这种形势？这是惶惶不安的华盛顿方面煞费心思的一个问题。一个由国务卿赫脱主持的“拉丁美洲事务国家顾问委员会”成立并且开始活动了，据说它的任务是“重新调整”美国对拉丁美洲的政策。
    美国嚷嚷要“调整”它对拉丁美洲的政策已经有几年了。但是尽管嚷着“调整”，遭到的反对却是越来越厉害。根本问题是美国统治集团的所谓“调整”，不过是在它被唾弃的、奴役和侵略拉丁美洲各国人民的政策上披上一张更加容易迷惑人的画皮而已。
    值得注意的是，美国近来对一些拉丁美洲国家已竭力装出一副“笑脸”。今年8月，国务卿赫脱在美洲外长会议上大谈“不干涉美洲国家内政的原则”。10月美国国务院就同古巴关系发表的声明里宣称美国“遵守不干涉古巴内政的政策”。但是，美国政府的实际行动如何呢？美国今年在拉丁美洲的干涉重点正是古巴。美国把古巴革命胜利看作眼中钉。美国公开在本土窠藏古巴反革命匪徒，并且以美国本土及古巴邻国为基地，连接不断地在古巴策动反革命武装叛乱和破坏活动。甚至在美国官方高唱“不干涉”的同时，美国政府屡次照会古巴，要挟古巴放弃土地改革计划，否则便要削减古巴向美国出口蔗糖的份额等等。
    美国也曾经在巴拿马人民举行激烈反美示威时发表声明，表示愿意就双方“悬而未决的问题谋求共同满意的解决办法”。但是就在美国同巴拿马举行的所谓“友好谈判”中，它公然威胁巴拿马人民不得采取反对美国霸占巴拿马运河区的行动。
    一贯在拉丁美洲扶植独裁政权的美国，近来还表示它“反对独裁”，希望实施所谓“代议制民主”。美国为今年8月举行的美洲外长会议安排的两项议程之一是“代议制民主的有效实施和尊重人权”问题。拉丁美洲的公正舆论当时即已指出，美国这样作的真正目的是为了诋毁古巴革命政权“没有代议制民主”，组织对古巴的干涉活动。有目共睹的事实是，原来美国扶植的古巴巴蒂斯塔独裁政权同好些其他独裁政权一样垮台了，而美国目前继续在全力支撑着残留的一些独裁者。
    经济“援助”是美国正在不断加强的对拉丁美洲国家施放的“糖衣炮弹”。1958年美国对拉丁美洲的“援助”和贷款总数达五亿九千四百万美元，而1957年是三亿三千七百万美元，1955年是一亿美元。1959年完整的统计数字还没有，仅智利和墨西哥两国，贷款和“援助”即达三亿一千五百万美元。此外，美国今年还决定参加泛美开发银行，通过国际货币基金组织继续向一些经济困难的国家兜售“稳定经济计划”。
    “援助”的增加，就是掠夺和控制的加强。阿根廷接受“稳定经济计划”的结果是：货币贬值，工资冻结，物价暴涨，美国经济和政治势力长驱直入，国内经济和政治危机益形尖锐化。
    在拉丁美洲公众反对美国强加的军事基地、要求减轻扩军重担的运动蓬勃开展下，美国国务院11月底宣布，它“支持限制拉丁美洲军备的建议”。美国国务院的声明并且说，“长期以来，这一直是美国政府的态度。”但是，谁不知道，多年来美国一直在拉丁美洲加强备战部署。美国今年不仅增兵原有基地，还在阿根廷等国新设立了不少基地。它在拉丁美洲地区举行一连串的军事演习和核爆炸试验。而就在美国国务院宣布“支持限制拉丁美洲军备的建议”之后，12月7日，来自华盛顿的消息说，美国将给阿根廷、智利、秘鲁等国家若干潜水艇和海军舰只。
    尤其值得注意的是，在美国国务院所谓“支持限制军备”的声明里，并且谈到要“加强美洲集体安全制度”。这后面隐藏着至今未能得逞的组织“国际警察部队”的阴谋。美国今年来一直在活动组织这支部队来推翻古巴目前的政权和镇压其他国家民族运动，但在6月中美国家会议和8月美洲国家外长会议上都没有得到响应。而美国国会议员早已主张在“美洲集体制度”名义下成立这支部队，国会已决定为此拨出三千多万美元的经费。
    很明显，美国统治集团的这一套所谓“不干涉”、“反独裁”、“友好谈判”、“经济援助”甚至“限制军备”之类不过是假面具，“笑脸”是虚，“刀剑”是实。
    这一切只是为了掩盖它更加紧对拉丁美洲民族民主运动的镇压，更加紧对拉丁美洲的经济掠夺。当然，这样做的结果不可能是别的，只能是拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义的浪潮更加汹涌高涨。
