    Reported by our newspaper: According to the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun," the "Security Treaty Criticism Group," centered around literary figures such as Kiyoshi Aono, Tatsuzo Ishikawa, Katsuiro Kamei, and Kenzo Nakajima, held a "Criticism of the Security Treaty Speech Meeting" on November 26th at the Kyoritsu Auditorium in Kanda, Tokyo.
    
    Approximately 1,300 people attended the lecture. The meeting was chaired by Kenzo Kawashima. Ten cultural figures, including Tatsuzo Ishikawa, Katsuiro Kamei, Jun Eto, Sumako Fukao, Zen'ei Hotta, Sumiko Tanaka, Ryoumei Iisaka (Professor at Gakushuin University), Hajime Terasawa (Associate Professor at the University of Tokyo), Osamu Takizawa (Member of the Mingei Theatre Company), and Kagemi Nishikawa (Head Priest of Honpo Temple), criticized the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Security Treaty."
    
    Tatsuzo Ishikawa said, "Some say that Japan cannot survive without doing business with the United States. However, if it is necessary to do business with the United States, wouldn't it be sufficient to sign a commercial treaty? Why is it necessary to conclude a new military alliance? I suspect that some people must want to make money. I cannot help but think that the situation is this: the munitions industry is profitable, and the conservative parties want to help them make money to consolidate their own positions. The authorities want to revise the 'Security Treaty' precisely for this reason."
    
    Sumiko Tanaka emphasized that the people's lives will become increasingly difficult due to the revision of the "Security Treaty." She said, "Whenever unemployment countermeasures and disaster countermeasures are mentioned, the government always says that it cannot raise money. If they are really that poor, then why does the authorities spend such a large sum of money on military expenses? Increasing defense spending due to the revision of the 'Security Treaty' would probably push the already poorly implemented social insurance work into an even more pitiful situation. ... Japan does not take people seriously enough. Although the government says that revising this treaty is for peace and independence, it is clearly a military alliance, as the American side frankly admits. If true independence is desired, wouldn't it be better for Japan not to participate in any military groups?"
    
    Ryoumei Iisaka, who traveled to Southeast Asia twice this year, said that he had deep feelings when he saw the situations in Burma and Thailand. He said, "Neutral Burma and Thailand, which receives American aid and invests large sums of money in the military, are clearly different. In Bangkok, neon lights are flashing, and dance halls are lively. Compared to this situation, Rangoon in Burma does not have such prosperity. However, the university students in that country said: 'We have chosen the uneven path of neutrality. Although this path is uneven, we have a bright future...' I wondered at the time, which country is Japan like? Isn't Japan being dragged along by the superficial prosperity displayed by the colorful neon lights of the dance halls? Japan should not be influenced by such prejudices, nor be dragged along by superficial prosperity, but strive for true independence and freedom."
    
    Katsuiro Kamei criticized the method of posing the question often seen in Japan, "Anti-communist, or pro-communist?" He said, "That kind of thinking is outdated. Our group is composed of people with different positions. Despite this, we are united in our concern about the work of revising the 'Security Treaty.' The issue is not about anti-communism or pro-communism or other ideologies. The issue is whether the lives of our people are stable. Therefore, I oppose the authorities' revision of the 'Security Treaty' and believe that Japan should choose the path of neutrality."
    
    Jun Eto also said that the "Security Treaty" cannot guarantee Japan's survival. He said, "The Japanese government believes that military force is justice, and believes that this idea of theirs is realistic. This was indeed realistic in the nineteenth century, but it has become unrealistic in the twentieth century. How much the world has changed in these ten years. In the 1960s, the world will probably change even more. The situation in 1970 is impossible to predict. Despite this, the government still says 'Revise the Security Treaty, hand over ten years, and don't worry about anything!' Isn't this a fanciful, unrealistic idea?"
    
    Zen'ei Hotta also spoke about this "ten-year" problem: "What will the future picture of Japan look like? I am not a prophet, I cannot predict. Although the so-called future is difficult to understand, there is a way to understand it. The way is in history. Japan owes a 'debt' in history. This 'debt' is the issue of China. The growth of modern Japan was achieved by plundering Chinese wealth. I cannot understand the morals of those who do not want to repay this historical debt. Not recognizing China, but wanting to do business, this idea is the same as 'wanting to buy cigarettes in a cigarette shop, but not recognizing the existence of the cigarette shop,' and can only be said that the person who thinks this way is a fool. Revising the 'Security Treaty' is to pre-borrow the next ten years of Japanese history on the basis of this foolish idea. And it is to instill a kind of 'Security Treaty mentality,' which can also be said to be a 'patronage mentality' domestically. I believe this practice is eroding Japanese culture..."
    
    At the lecture, Kagemi Nishikawa, from the standpoint of a Buddhist, Osamu Takizawa, based on his own past experience, and Hajime Terasawa, based on the expert viewpoint of an international law scholar, respectively explained the dangers of revising the "Security Treaty." Poet Sumako Fukao recited her own poem: "We must become people who can think again to consider... Is it okay to think like this? Is it okay? ... Become clever little sheep... Think about whether the outstretched hand is a wolf's claw painted with color..." When she recited the poem, which was one hundred lines long, there was great applause in the hall.
    
    "Asahi Shimbun" said: "None of these speeches are clichés. Although the tone of the speakers is calm and subdued, it is possible to fully feel how closely they are paying attention to the 'Security Treaty' issue; and it can be seen that they are expressing a clear determination to oppose the revision of the 'Security Treaty.'"

### 日本文学家集会批判“安全条约”  修改“安全条约”贻害无穷  选择中立道路前途光明

    日本文学家集会批判“安全条约”
    修改“安全条约”贻害无穷
    选择中立道路前途光明
    本报讯　据日本“朝日新闻”消息：以青野季吉、石川达三、龟井胜一郎、中岛健藏等文学家为核心组成的“安全条约批判会”11月26日在东京神田的共立讲堂举行了一次“批判安全条约演讲会”。
    到会听讲的人约有一千三百人。演讲会由川岛健藏主持。石川达三、龟井胜一郎、江藤淳、深尾须磨子、堀田善卫、田中寿美子、饭坂良明（学习院大学教授）、寺泽一（东京大学副教授）、泷泽修（民艺剧团人员）、西川景文（本法寺主持）等十位文化界人士抨击岸信介政府修改“安全条约”。
    石川达三说，“有人说，日本如果不同美国做买卖就活不下去。但是，假如需要同美国做买卖的话，签订通商条约不就可以了吗？为什么非缔结新的军事同盟不可呢？恐怕一定有人要赚钱。我不能不认为情况是这样的：军需工业有利可图，保守政党想使他们赚钱，以便巩固自己的地盘。当局要修改‘安全条约’，正是由于这个缘故。”
    田中寿美子强调指出，国民的生活会因为“安全条约”的修改而越来越困难。她说：“一谈到失业对策和灾害对策，政府总是说筹不到钱。如果真是穷到那个地步，那为什么当局要把那么一大笔钱用去作军事费呢？由于修改‘安全条约’而增拨防御费，那样做恐怕就会使向来就没有好好进行的社会保险工作陷于更加可怜的境地。……，日本太不把人当做一回事了。虽然政府说修改这项条约是为了和平和独立，可是，正像对方的美国坦率地承认的那样，那显然是军事同盟。如果希望真正的独立，日本不参加任何军事集团不好吗？”
    今年到东南亚旅行过两次的饭坂良明说，他看到缅甸和泰国的情况，有很深的感受。他说：“中立的缅甸和接受美国援助、把大笔钱投到军事方面去的泰国显然不同。在曼谷，霓虹灯在闪耀着，舞场很热闹。同这种情况比较起来，缅甸的仰光却没有这样的繁华。可是，这个国家的大学生说：‘我们选择了不平坦的中立道路。虽然这条道路不平坦，可是我们有光明的前途……’我当时想，日本的情况像哪一国呢？日本不正是被那种用舞场的五颜六色的霓虹灯显示出来的表面繁荣拖着走吗？日本应该不受那种偏见所影响，不被表面的繁荣拖着走，而去争取真正的独立和自由。”
    龟井胜一郎批评了在日本常见的“反共呢，还是容共呢？”那种提出问题的方法。他说：“那样的想法已经过时了。我们的这个会是由立场各不相同的人组成的。虽然这样，我们在对修改‘安全条约’工作都感到担心这一点上却是一致的。问题不在于反共还是容共等等思想意识。问题在于我们国民的生活是不是安定这一点。因此我反对当局修改‘安全条约’，认为日本应该选择中立的道路。”
    江藤淳也说“安全条约”并不能保障日本的生存。他说：“日本政府认为武力就是正义，并且认为它这种想法是现实的。这在十九世纪，的确曾经是现实的，但在二十世纪就变成不现实的了。在这十年间，世界起了多么大的变化啊。到1960年代，恐怕世界更要变化吧。1970年的情况，是预料也预料不出来的。尽管如此，但是，政府还说‘修改安全条约，把十年交出来，你们什么都不要管吧！’这不是空想的、不现实的想法，又是什么呢？”
    堀田善卫也就这个“十年”的问题说：“日本的未来图景是什么样子？我不是预言家，我是不能预言的。所谓未来，虽然是不好懂的，但是，要想懂，是有办法的。办法就在历史上。日本在历史上欠了‘债’。这笔‘债’就是对中国问题。现代日本的成长，是靠掠夺中国财富的办法来实现的。对于不想偿还这笔历史债的人们的道德观，我是不能理解的。不承认中国，但是想要做买卖，这种想法同‘想要在纸烟铺买纸烟，但是不承认纸烟铺的存在’这一说法相同，只能说这样想的人是个傻瓜而已。修改‘安全条约’就是要在这种愚蠢的想法的基础上预借今后十年的日本的历史。而且是要在国内灌输一种也可以说它是‘安全条约根性’的‘求庇护的根性’。我认为这种做法在侵蚀着日本的文化……”
    在演讲会上，还有西川景文站在佛教徒的立场上，泷泽修根据他自己过去的经验，寺泽一根据国际法学家的专家观点，分别说明了修改“安全条约”的危险性。诗人深尾须磨子朗诵了她自己作的诗：“我们要重新成为能够思考的人来考虑……想一想这样就可以吗？可以吗？……要成为聪明的小羊……想一想伸出来的手是不是涂上颜色的狼爪……”当她朗诵长达一百行的诗的时候，会场响起了很大的掌声。
    “朝日新闻”说：“这些演讲没有一个是老一套的。演讲者的语调虽然都是平稳而且低沉的，但是，可以令人充分感觉到他们多么密切地注意‘安全条约’问题；而且可以看出他们表现出来的对反对修改‘安全条约’运动的明确的决心。”
