    Beijing Vigorously Promotes Mechanization of Cooking Utensils
    After the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant used machines for cooking, personnel were reduced by two-fifths, working hours were shortened by one-quarter, and the quality of meals improved significantly.
    The manufacture of cooking machinery is mainly based on indigenous methods combined with foreign technology and self-reliance. Specialized factories also manufacture some.
    (This newspaper reports) Following the example of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant canteen in the mechanization of cooking utensils, a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution in the mechanization of cooking utensils has recently been set off in the collective canteens of many factories, construction sites, government agencies, shops, schools, streets, and some people's communes in the capital. According to incomplete statistics, in just over a month, one hundred and sixty-six collective canteens have produced three hundred and eighty-two pieces of cooking machinery; the collective canteens of more than twenty units, such as the Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory, the Beijing Instrument Factory, and the Shijingshan Power Plant, have achieved mechanization of their main cooking utensils.
    This movement began in the canteen of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. After this canteen basically realized the mechanization of cooking utensils, the number of cooks was reduced from one hundred and forty-seven to eighty-three, and the ratio of cooks to dining employees changed from one to forty-three to one to seventy-one, proving that the potential of the canteen's labor force is very large.
    Under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, this canteen has adopted a method combining cooks, workers, and cadres since March this year. Combining indigenous methods with foreign technology, using waste materials, designing its own equipment, and after hundreds of experiments, it has successively trial-produced ten kinds of cooking machinery such as rice washing, dishwashing, dough mixing, and vegetable cutting, basically realizing the mechanization of cooking utensils and eliminating heavy manual labor. Although the number of cooks has been reduced by two-fifths, the working hours of each person per day have been reduced by one-quarter. This not only improved cooking efficiency but also created better conditions for improving meals, improving canteen hygiene, and improving the cooks' political, cultural, and technical levels. In the past, cooks had heavy physical labor and had no time to improve food varieties. After realizing mechanization, more than one hundred new recipes have been formulated, and the number of main and non-staple foods each day has increased from seven or eight to about forty. The attendance rate of the canteen's cultural class often reaches more than 90%. Recently, they also formed an amateur drama group and rehearsed dramas themselves.
    The relevant departments of Beijing Municipality attached great importance to the canteen’s initiative. More than a month ago, they seriously summarized the experience of the canteen in basically realizing the mechanization of cooking utensils, and successively held several on-site meetings, deciding to vigorously promote it in collective canteens of all walks of life throughout the city. This work has received attention from leaders of many departments and is welcomed by the vast number of cooks. A technical innovation and technical revolution movement to realize the mechanization of cooking utensils quickly formed throughout the city. After the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company sent people to the canteen of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant to visit and learn, the Party committee secretary immediately convened a meeting of cooks, formed a leading group for the innovation of cooking machinery, and put forward the slogan "Fight hard for fifty days, the canteen machines turn, the number of people is reduced by half, and the efficiency is doubled," mobilizing the masses to manufacture sixty-one cooking machines in half a month, and another sixty machines are under construction. Under the leadership of the Party committee, all the cooks of the Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory worked together, bought waste products from the waste product company, and after half a month of hard work, they made vegetable cutting machines, dishwashing machines, and rice washing machines, and improved the oven, making the labor efficiency generally increased by ten times, and the most increased by forty-four times. The ratio of cooks to diners has reached about one to eighty.
    Beijing has adopted a combination of self-reliance by various units and manufacturing by specialized factories to manufacture cooking machinery. All units with conditions adopt the method of hard work and self-reliance to manufacture cooking machinery; for some units that do not have the conditions to manufacture cooking machinery themselves, the Beijing Municipal Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau has designated the Haidian Agricultural Machinery Factory to be responsible for manufacturing and supplying them. At present, this factory has accepted orders for more than one thousand cooking machines from one hundred and forty-five units.
    At present, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of mechanization and semi-mechanization of cooking utensils in Beijing is developing further. Many canteens are striving to achieve results within the year, saving labor to support industrial and agricultural production and other work.

    北京大力推行炊具机械化
    第一机床厂用机械做饭以后，人员减少五分之二，工作时间缩短四分之一，饭菜质量显著提高
    炊事机械的制造以土洋结合自力更生为主　专业工厂也制造一部分
    本报讯　以北京市第一机床厂食堂炊事用具机械化为标兵，首都许多工厂、工地、机关、商店、学校、街道和一部分人民公社的集体食堂，最近掀起了炊具机械化的技术革新和技术革命高潮。据不完全统计，一个多月来已有一百六十六个集体食堂制成了三百八十二件炊事机械；北京广播器材厂、北京仪器厂、石景山发电厂等二十多个单位的集体食堂，主要炊具已经实现了机械化。
    这一运动是从北京第一机床厂食堂开始的。这个食堂基本上实现了炊事用具机械化以后，炊事员由一百四十七人减少到八十三人，炊事员和用餐职工的比例由一比四十三变为一比七十一，证明了食堂劳动力的潜力是很大的。
    这个食堂在工厂党委领导下，从今年3月起就采用炊事员、工人、干部三结合的办法，土洋结合，利用废料，自己设计，经过上百次试验，陆续试制成功了淘米、洗碗、和面、切菜等十种炊事机械，基本上实现了炊具机械化，消灭了笨重体力劳动。炊事员虽然减少了五分之二，每人每天的工作时间却减少了四分之一。这样，就不仅提高了炊事操作效率，还为改善伙食，改善食堂卫生，以及提高炊事员的政治、文化、技术水平创造了更好的条件。过去炊事员体力劳动繁重，无暇改进食品花样；实现机械化以后，已制定了一百多种新食谱，每天的主副食由过去的七、八种增加到四十种左右。食堂文化班的出勤率经常达到90％以上。最近，他们还组成了业余话剧组，自己排演戏剧。
    北京市有关部门对这个食堂的创举极为重视，在一个多月前，就认真总结了这个食堂基本上实现炊具机械化的经验，连续召开了几次现场会议，决定在全市各行各业的集体食堂中大力推广。这一工作受到很多部门领导人员的重视和广大炊事员的欢迎，一个实现炊具机械化的技术革新和技术革命运动很快在全市形成。石景山钢铁公司派人到第一机床厂食堂参观学习以后，党委书记立即召开炊事人员会议，组成炊事机械革新领导小组，提出“大战五十天，食堂机器转，人员减一半，效率翻一番”的口号，发动群众，半月时间就制成了六十一台炊事机械，还有六十台机械正在制造中。北京广播器材厂全体炊事员在党委领导下，一起动手，从废品公司买来废品，经半月奋战，制成了切菜机、洗碗机和洗米机，并且改进了烤炉，使劳动效率一般都提高十倍，最多的提高四十四倍。炊事员和用餐人数的比例达到一比八十左右。
    北京市制造炊事机械，采取了各单位自力更生和专业工厂制造相结合的办法。凡有条件的单位都采用穷干苦干的办法，自力更生制造炊事机械；一些没有条件自行制造炊事机械的单位，北京市机电工业局已指定海淀农业机械厂负责制造供给。现在，这个工厂已经接受了一百四十五个单位的一千余台炊事机械的订货。
    目前，北京市炊具机械化和半机械化的技术革新和技术革命运动正在进一步深入发展。许多食堂力争在年内作出成绩，节省出劳动力来支援工农业生产和其他工作。
