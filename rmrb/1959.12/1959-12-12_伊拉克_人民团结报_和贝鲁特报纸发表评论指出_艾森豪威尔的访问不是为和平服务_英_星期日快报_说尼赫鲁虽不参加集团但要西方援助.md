Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 10th: The Iraqi "People's Unity" newspaper published a commentary on December 8th stating that Eisenhower's visit is not for the service of world peace.

The commentary pointed out that most of the eleven countries Eisenhower visited are members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The commentary said that these aggressive treaties are aimed at socialist countries and national liberation movements, especially the national liberation movement in the Middle East region.

The newspaper said that the purpose of Eisenhower's trip is obvious, it can only be to promote and instigate the reactionary policies implemented by most member states of these military treaties.

The newspaper pointed out, "What is noteworthy in this visit is that the countries included in this visit include India, as well as the recent talks Eisenhower has made in this regard." The newspaper said that reactionary groups inside and outside India are attempting to use the Sino-Indian border dispute to make India abandon its policy of peace and independence. The newspaper emphasized that the Sino-Indian dispute is only a matter between the two countries and should be resolved through peaceful negotiations between the two countries, "Imperialist countries and others attempting to interfere in this matter will only harm the two countries' achievement of understanding and harm the cause of peace and international cooperation in Asia and the world."

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 10th: Beirut newspapers continued to publish articles on the 10th exposing the United States' two-faced policy, pointing out that the United States only puts on a show of supporting peace on the surface, but in fact takes a hostile attitude towards peace.

The "Beirut Evening News" published an editorial on the 10th saying that when Arabs see President Eisenhower in Rome, Ankara, and Karachi raising his hands and shouting for peace in photographs, and at the same time see news in the newspapers that the United States supports France in fighting the Algerian people, they immediately see through the United States' hypocritical two-faced policy.

The newspaper expressed its belief that the United States' policy "cannot deceive anyone. ... We doubt whether this policy can peddle 'peace' and buy friends."

The "Voice of the Arabs" newspaper published a cartoon on the front page on the 9th exposing the United States' two-faced policy, depicting Eisenhower holding a smiling mask with an olive branch symbolizing peace in one hand, while the other hand is holding de Gaulle as a dagger, stabbing the Algerian people in the back. The caption of the cartoon is: "The inspiration from the United States' 'peace plan' trip!"

An article in "Call of the People" on the 10th said, "Whenever anything happens between the Arabs and the imperialists, the United States never fails to walk in front of our enemies, funding them and encouraging them to attack the Arab people."

Xinhua News Agency, December 11th: London dispatch: The British "Sunday Express" published an article by Taylor on the 6th, commenting on US President Eisenhower's visit to India and the Sino-Indian border dispute.

The article mentioned that Eisenhower will encounter a "big mystery" during his visit to Delhi, which is: "Why did the border dispute between India and China suddenly erupt and become a global headline?" The article refuted the view "that this dispute is recent and was deliberately provoked by China."

The article said, "In fact, border entanglements have been going on for a long time. And when this entanglement became headline news, the Chinese were as surprised as anyone else. Take the Ladakh issue as an example. Here, the Chinese built a road through what is claimed to be Indian territory. But a road cannot be built overnight. Road construction has been going on here for several years. Indeed, this place is almost uninhabited. But even so, it is unimaginable that the Delhi government has only just learned about the road construction."

The article said, "It was India, not China, that brought the news to the world's attention - Nehru, not Zhou Enlai. So why did Mr. Nehru do this?"

The article then put forward its own answer, saying, "Nehru has encountered economic difficulties. India lives in long-term poverty. India is in extreme need of assistance from wealthy, advanced countries, especially the United States. Nehru's dilemma lies here. He is determined to continue non-alignment and determined not to stand under the Western banner. But he needs Western aid."

The author of the article believes that people "should hesitate" when taking steps on the Sino-Indian border issue, because "if this matter is a naked and brutal aggression, then there should be no hesitation, no matter how great the danger or how serious the consequences may be. But that is not the case." The article said, "The Chinese side has never been heard. They are unjustly excluded from the United Nations."

The article said: "Ladakh is of no value to India. That road is of great value to the Chinese."

As for the so-called McMahon Line at the eastern end of the border between the two countries, the article believes that "this line was drawn by a British official in 1914... but has never been approved by any Chinese government from then to now. On the contrary, successive Chinese governments have insisted that they do not recognize the McMahon Line. For more than forty years, the Chinese government has been busy dealing with internal chaos and foreign aggressors, so it has no time to deal with this remote border. Now China has brought up the 1914 argument again... the Chinese have a lot to say on this argument."

    伊拉克“人民团结报”和贝鲁特报纸发表评论指出
    艾森豪威尔的访问不是为和平服务
    英“星期日快报”说尼赫鲁虽不参加集团但要西方援助
    新华社巴格达10日电　伊拉克“人民团结报”12月8日发表评论说，艾森豪威尔的访问不是为世界和平服务的。
    评论指出，艾森豪威尔访问的十一个国家大部分是东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织或北大西洋公约组织的成员国。评论说，这些侵略性条约是矛头针对社会主义国家和民族解放运动的，特别是中东地区的民族解放运动。
    报纸说，艾森豪威尔此行的目的是显而易见的，它只能是助长和怂恿这些军事条约的大多数成员国所执行的反动政策。
    报纸指出，“在这次访问中引人注意的是：这次访问的国家中包括印度以及最近艾森豪威尔在这方面所发表的谈话”。报纸说，印度国内外的反动集团企图利用中印边界争端来使印度放弃和平独立的政策。报纸强调说，中印争端只是这两个国家的事，并且应该通过两国的和平谈判来解决，“帝国主义国家和其他企图干预这件事的人只会损害两国取得谅解，损害亚洲和全世界的和平和国际合作事业”。
    新华社贝鲁特10日电　贝鲁特报纸10日继续登载文章揭露美国的两面政策，指出美国仅仅在表面上装出拥护和平的姿态，事实上对和平采取敌视态度。
    “贝鲁特晚报”10日发表社论说，当阿拉伯人看到艾森豪威尔总统在罗马、安卡拉和卡拉奇高举着手高喊和平的照片，同时又在报上看到美国支持法国同阿尔及利亚人民作战的消息时，他们对美国口是心非的两面派政策就一目了然了。
    报纸表示相信，美国的这种政策是“欺骗不了任何人的。……我们怀疑这种政策是否能兜售出‘和平’和收买到朋友”。
    “阿拉伯之声报”9日在头版登载了一幅揭露美国两面派政策的漫画，画着艾森豪威尔一只手拿着一张面露笑容、戴着象征和平的橄榄树枝的假面具，而另一只手握住戴高乐当作一把匕首，从背后刺向阿尔及利亚人民。漫画的说明是：“美国‘和平计划’旅行给人的启发！”
    “呼声报”在10日的一篇文章中说，“在阿拉伯人和帝国主义者之间发生任何事情时，美国没有一次不走在我们敌人的前面，资助他们，怂恿他们来攻击阿拉伯人民。”
    新华社11日讯　伦敦消息：英国“星期日快报”6日刊载了泰勒写的一篇文章，评论美国总统艾森豪威尔对印度的访问和中印边界争端。
    文章谈到，艾森豪威尔在德里访问时将遇到一个“大谜”，就是：“印中两国的边界纠纷为什么会突然爆发出来，并成了全世界的头条新闻？”文章批驳了这样一种看法，“以为这种争端是新近发生的，而且是由中国蓄意挑起的”。
    文章说，“事实上，边界上的纠葛，已经持续了一个长时期。而且当这种纠葛成了头条新闻时，中国人同任何人一样地感到意外。就拿拉达克问题来说吧。在这里，中国人修筑了一条通过据称是印度领土的公路。但是一条公路不是一夜之间就能建成的。筑路工作已在这里进行了好几年了。的确这块地方差不多是荒无人烟。但是即使如此，也无法想像德里政府是现在才刚刚知道筑路之事。”
    文章说，“提请世界注意这个消息的是印度，而不是中国——是尼赫鲁，而不是周恩来。那么尼赫鲁先生为什么要这样作呢？”
    文章接着提出自己的答案说，“尼赫鲁遇到了经济上的困难。印度生活在长期的贫困中。印度极端需要富有的、先进的国家的援助，尤其是美国的援助。尼赫鲁的两难处境就在这里。他决心要继续不参加集团，决心不站在西方的旗帜下。可是他需要西方的援助。”
    文章的作者认为人们在对于中印边界问题采取步骤的时候“应该迟疑一下”，因为“如果这件事是一次赤裸裸的粗暴的侵略，那么便不容有什么迟疑，不论会冒多大的危险或者会有何等严重的后果。但是事情不是那样。”文章说，“中国人的理由从来未被听取过。他们被不公正地排除在联合国的外面。”
    文章说：“拉达克对于印度没有什么价值。那条公路对于中国人却具有很大价值。”
    至于两国边界东头的所谓麦克马洪线，文章认为“这条线是在1914年由一位英国官员制定的……但是从未得到从那时到现在的任何一个中国政府的批准。相反的，历届中国政府都坚持说，它不承认麦克马洪线。四十多年来，中国政府一直忙于对付内部混乱和外国侵略者，以致无暇处理这条遥远的边界。现在中国重又提出1914年的论点……在这个论点上，中国人是有很多话可说的。”
