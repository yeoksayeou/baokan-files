    Money Can't Buy Everything
    Gong Tongwen
    Using the phrase "money can't buy everything" to describe the noble style of the working class is indeed inappropriate. They would rise up to retort: "We are building socialism, not doing it for money." This statement is correct. What this article intends to criticize are precisely those who attempt to use "money" to buy enthusiasm. Some people one-sidedly emphasize material incentives to motivate the masses' production enthusiasm, even attempting to negate the Party's policy of putting politics in command.
    Our Party advocates the combination of political education and material encouragement, but politics must be in command, and ideology must be the soul. I can cite countless examples to illustrate the extreme importance of putting politics in command.
    Ma Xueli, a worker at the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, devoted himself to labor, boldly innovated, stepped forward when faced with difficulties, yielded when it came to honor, learned from the advanced, and helped the backward. Li Taizhuan, a 47-year-old miner at Yuanhua Coal Mine, has had perfect attendance for ten years since liberation, day after day. Li Guangzhen, a female worker at Shashi Yarn Factory and a mother of three, has had perfect attendance for ten years, month after month, year after year. Han Wendi, the deputy shift leader of the Qingshan Thermal Power Plant and a member of the Communist Youth League, fearlessly rescued the factory and his endangered comrades in thick smoke and raging fire... And so on, famous and nameless, thousands upon thousands of heroic models, are the outstanding sons and daughters of China, the advanced fighters of communism. However, in their eyes, these outstanding deeds have become so ordinary, not even kept in mind. For many years, no one knew about them, yet they continued to work, seizing every minute and second, year after year. What power supports and encourages them? Can this be measured with money! Let me tell another story. In the spring of 1958, a single-labor household came to mobilize retired worker Huang Leting to work at his home, saying, "As long as you are willing to work, you can earn 200 yuan a month." Huang Leting asked him, "Are you a single-labor household?" The man nodded. Huang Leting waved his hand and left. He said, "I am taking the socialist road. No matter how much money you offer, I will not take the capitalist road." When a state-owned factory asked him for help another time, he said, "As long as it is for socialism, I won't take a penny!" The answer can only be one: under the leadership of the Party, they have put politics in command. They have infinite love for the new society and infinite hatred for the old society. The noble working class's sense of awareness and pride has become a powerful driving force in their lives.
    Perhaps someone will retort: "These are just a few advanced elements!"
    Well, let's take a look at 1958. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and other working people were full of energy, high in spirits, working tirelessly, day and night. Where did this energy come from?
    We never deny material interests. The political command emphasized by our Party is precisely the result of the thorough socialist revolution, the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and the liberation of social productive forces. Workers and peasants like to recall and compare. When they think of the old society, they feel infinite sorrow. When they see the new society, they are full of energy. After liberation, they have undergone a great transformation politically and economically. Now, with the attitude of masters, they stand tall and march forward to build their beautiful life—communism. Isn't this the greatest interest, the long-term interest, and the fundamental interest of the working people! Isn't putting politics in command a concentrated reflection of economics!
    Only by adhering to putting politics in command can we better combine political education and material encouragement. Only then can we better implement the principle of material encouragement. Some people think that only economic incentives can improve production enthusiasm, and they do not think that the socialist consciousness of the masses has any significant effect. What are the consequences of this neglect of politics? We have had experience and lessons. When this is done, the more material incentives are emphasized, the more "unsatisfied" people become. They compare their lives, and as they compare, their revolutionary will declines, evil tendencies rise, and some people fall into the quagmire of bourgeois individualism and cannot extricate themselves. Conversely, when the banner is raised high, there is a great competition of energy, production leaps forward, and people feel comfortable. Why? Because the opposite of putting politics in command is bourgeois individualism, so it is a sharp class struggle. There was a young worker in Jiang'an Vehicle Factory who worked as an apprentice in a pharmacy before liberation, and he was determined to become a small boss. After the pharmacy collapsed, he went home to study, determined to become an engineer. He said that he had a personal general line, that is, "work for money, no concern for meals, work more when there is more money, work less when there is less money, no work without money, man for himself, heaven and earth will punish him." May I ask, if you follow this path, won't you go to capitalism! This kind of thinking is not unique. Relying on material incentives to mobilize his enthusiasm is like "meat buns hitting a dog, once gone, never returning." The bourgeois's insatiable, profit-seeking nature is a stinking pit that can never be filled. Those who are infected with bourgeois individualism are preoccupied with personal gains and losses, and they are endlessly distressed. They must have a bed worth 160 yuan for marriage, and they are not satisfied if there are any goods they cannot buy. Although the proportion of people who simply pursue personal enjoyment and are indifferent to socialist construction is very small among the staff and workers, if we do not resist it and overcome it, then it will have a bad effect of corroding the working class.
    Please do not misunderstand. Our emphasis on putting politics in command is not only not contradictory to caring about the lives of the masses, but also does not violate the basic economic law of "gradually improving the people's living standards on the basis of production development." We are correctly grasping and applying objective laws. At the same time, we also know that the development of production always lags one step behind the needs of life. Of course, this is the driving force for promoting production development, but the masses must also understand this principle. This autumn, the leaders of an enterprise in Wuhan mobilized the masses to send representatives to visit Lao Tongcheng Restaurant (Hankou's first-class restaurant). The restaurant gave them an accounting comparison: from 1950 to 1954, the average daily sales were more than 250 yuan, serving more than 1,000 people. In 1958, the average daily sales were more than 1,300 yuan. From January to October 1959, the average daily sales were more than 2,800 yuan. From 1950 to 1954, capitalists and single-labor households accounted for 70% of the people served, while since 1958, workers and peasants have accounted for the vast majority. This is a vivid lesson in socialist education. The masses saw the facts of production development and improved living standards, and they also understood the changes in the relationship between supply and demand during the period of socialist construction, which greatly improved their awareness, and a new upsurge in production appeared. Comparing this with simple material incentives, which one is more powerful? Isn't it self-evident! The workers said it well: "We want politics in command, not banknotes in command."

    千金难买
    龚同文
    用“千金难买”这句话来形容工人阶级的高尚风格，的确是不恰当的。他们会起来反驳说：“我们是为了建设社会主义，不是为了钱。”这句话说得对。本文所要批判的也正是那些企图用“千金”来买积极性的人。有些人片面强调物质刺激来调动群众的生产积极性，甚至企图以此来否定党的政治挂帅的方针。
    我们党是主张政治教育和物质鼓励相结合的，但是必须以政治为统帅，思想为灵魂。我可以举出无数的事例来说明政治挂帅的极端重要性。
    武汉重型机床厂调整工马学礼同志，忘我劳动，大胆革新，见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮。源华煤矿四十七岁的老矿工李太转同志，解放以后，十年不缺勤，十年如一日。沙市纱厂女工李光珍同志，三个小孩的妈妈，十年不缺勤，年年月月红。青山热电厂运行副班长、青年团员韩文第，在浓烟烈火中，奋不顾身，抢救工厂，抢救遇难的伙伴……如此等等，有名的，无名的，千千万万的英雄模范，是中国的优秀儿女，是共产主义的先进战士。可是，在他们心目中，这些卓绝的事却变得如此平凡，没有记在心上，多少年无人知道，他们同样是争分夺秒地、年复一年地干着，干着。这是什么力量支持和鼓舞着他们呢？难道说，这是能够用货币来计量的吗！再说一个故事。1958年春天，有一家独劳户来动员退休老工人黄乐庭到他家里去做工，说是“只要肯干，一月二百元都行。”黄乐庭问他：“你是独劳户么？”那人点了点头。黄乐庭一摆头就走了。他说：“我走的是社会主义，给多少钱，我也不走资本主义。”当另外一次国营工厂请他帮忙时，他说：“只要是为社会主义，我一个钱也不要！”答案只能是一个：在党的领导下，他们政治挂了帅。他们对新社会有无限的热爱，对旧社会有无限的仇恨。高尚的工人阶级的自觉心和自豪感，变成了他们生活中的强大的动力。
    也许有人反驳说：“这是少数的先进分子嘛！”
    好吧，就请我们看看1958年好了。广大的工农群众及其他劳动人民群众，干劲冲天、意气风发、废寝忘食、夜以继日地大干特干。这股劲，又是哪里来的呢？
    我们决不否认物质利益，我们党所强调的政治挂帅，正是彻底的社会主义革命，正确地处理人民内部矛盾，解放了社会生产力所产生的结果。工人、农民最喜欢回忆对比，他们一想到旧社会，无限悲伤，一看到新社会，浑身是劲。解放了，政治上、经济上大翻身，现在，他们以主人翁的姿态，挺起了胸膛，为建设自己美好的生活——共产主义而前进，前进。这不是劳动人民的最大利益、长远利益、根本利益吗！政治挂帅不正是经济的集中反映吗！
    只有坚持政治挂帅，才能更好地把政治教育和物质鼓励结合起来。才能更好地贯彻执行物质鼓励的原则。有些人以为只有靠经济上的刺激，才能提高生产积极性，对于群众的社会主义觉悟，却不认为有什么大的作用。这种忽视政治的后果如何呢？我们也有过经验和教训。当着这样做的时候，越讲物质刺激，反而越不能“满足”，都比生活，比来比去，革命意志衰退，邪气上升，使得有一些人陷入资产阶级个人主义的泥坑而不能自拔。反之，帅旗高举，大比干劲，生产跃进，人心舒畅。为什么？因为政治挂帅的对立面是资产阶级个人主义，所以它是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。江岸车辆厂有一个青年工人，解放前在药店当学徒，一心想当个小老板，药店垮了台，回家去读书，发奋想当工程师。他说自己有一条个人总路线，即“干活拿钱，吃饭不管，钱多多干，钱少少干，无钱不干，人不为己，天诛地灭。”试问，循着这条路走去，不是走到资本主义，还是哪里！这种思想不是绝无仅有的，靠物质刺激来调动他的积极性，那是“肉包子打狗，有去无来”，资产阶级贪得无厌，唯利是图的本质，是永远填不满的臭坑。凡是沾染了资产阶级个人主义的人，患得患失，苦恼无穷，结婚非有一百六十元一张的床不可，还有什么商品买不到就不满意。这种单纯追求个人享受，对社会主义事业漠不关心的人，在职工群众中占的比例虽然很小，但是如果不抵制它，不克服它，那末，它就起腐蚀工人阶级的坏作用。
    请不要发生误会，我们讲政治挂帅，不仅和关心群众生活不矛盾，而且也没有违背“在生产发展的基础上，逐步改善人民生活”的基本经济规律。我们是正确地掌握和运用着客观规律的。同时，我们也知道，生产的发展总是落在生活需要的后面一步。当然，这是促进生产发展的动力，但是也必须使群众懂得这个道理。今年秋季，武汉市一个企业的领导者发动群众派代表到老通成餐馆（汉口第一流餐馆）参观访问，这家餐馆给他们作了一个算账对比：1950—1954年平均每天卖二百五十多元，供应一千多人次，1958年平均每天卖钱额一千三百多元，1959年1—10月份平均每天卖钱额二千八百多元。供应对象1950—1954年资本家和独劳户占供应人数的70％，1958年以来，工人、农民占绝大部分。这是社会主义教育的生动的一课。群众看到了生产发展，生活改善的事实，也明白了社会主义建设时期供需关系的变化，从而大大提高了觉悟，生产出现了新高潮。拿这事和单纯物质刺激相比较，哪一个有力些？不是不言而喻吗！工人说得好：“我们要政治挂帅，不要钞票挂帅”。
