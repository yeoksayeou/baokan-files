Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 3rd - Albanian newspapers published commentaries on the 2nd, sternly condemning the U.S. State Department's statement issued on November 28th, which was hostile to Albania and slandered the friendship between Albania and the Soviet Union.

    "People's Voice" published a commentary pointing out that for fifteen years, the U.S. ruling clique has used every means to implement the so-called "liberation" and "independence" policy towards Albania, attempting to restore the feudal-bourgeois tyrannical system in Albania.

    The commentary said that the Albanian people despise the U.S. government's interference in Albania's internal affairs. This slanderous and provocative statement by the United States shows that not only does the tendency of the "Cold War" policy still dominate the U.S. State Department, but it is also trying to hinder the just-beginning relaxation of international tensions.

    "Unity" published a commentary saying that the Albanian people are not surprised by this action, as they have heard many such statements over the past fifteen years.

    The commentary said that this statement once again proves that the U.S. rulers still adhere to their policy of strength, and their policy of sabotage and interference. They want to use Albanian traitors and criminals residing abroad to organize U.S. spy networks, etc., to help them carry out subversive sabotage activities. But this is wishful thinking. Our people's power is solid. Today, Albania has loyal friends - the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Let the imperialists bark; our ranks are advancing with confidence.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 28th (TASS) - The U.S. State Department issued a statement in the worst traditions of the "Cold War" on the forty-seventh anniversary of Albania's independence. This statement, written according to the "Christmas Message" template, insisted that "Albania is subordinate to the Soviet Union," and said that the United States expresses "sympathy for the Albanian people's desire for national independence."

    The State Department attempted to portray this blatant provocative statement as a manifestation of "the United States' continuous pursuit of peace among all peoples in a spirit of justice." This is a rare example of hypocrisy.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸抨击美国的挑衅声明
    揭露美国统治者坚持实力政策
    新华社地拉那3日电　阿尔巴尼亚报纸2日发表评论，严正谴责美国国务院11月28日发表的敌视阿尔巴尼亚和诽谤阿尔巴尼亚同苏联友谊的声明。
    “人民之声报”发表的评论指出，十五年来，美国统治集团采用了一切手段来执行对阿尔巴尼亚的所谓“解放”、“独立”政策，图谋在阿尔巴尼亚复辟封建—资产阶级暴政制度。
    评论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民蔑视美国政府对阿尔巴尼亚内政的干涉。美国这一诬蔑和挑衅性的声明表明，不仅“冷战”政策的倾向仍然统治着美国国务院，而且还在竭力阻碍刚开始的国际紧张局势的缓和。
    “团结报”发表的评论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对这一行动并不感到惊异，十五年来他们已听到过很多这样的声明。
    评论说，这一声明又一次证明，美国统治者仍然坚持他们的实力政策，坚持破坏和干涉的政策。他们想利用侨居在国外的阿尔巴尼亚人民的叛徒和罪犯，组织美国的间谍网等，以帮助他们搞颠复破坏活动。但这是白费心机的。我们的人民政权是巩固的。今天，阿尔巴尼亚有着忠实的朋友——苏联和其他社会主义国家。让帝国主义去吠叫吧，我们的队伍正满怀信心地前进。
    新华社讯　塔斯社华盛顿11月28日讯：美国国务院在阿尔巴尼亚独立四十七周年的时候发表了一项坚持“冷战”最坏传统的声明。这项根据“圣诞咨文”样本写成的声明硬说“阿尔巴尼亚这个国家隶属于苏联”，说什么美国“对阿尔巴尼亚人民希望民族独立的愿望”表示“同情”。
    国务院企图把这项明目张胆的挑衅性声明说成是“美国本着公正的精神不断谋求各国人民之间的和平”的表现。这是少有的伪善的典型。
