U.S. Capital Controls Canadian Economy
Canadian "Globe and Mail" Alarms that Canada Has Become a Colony

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to materials recently published by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics of Canada, the economic lifeline of Canada, a country that was previously dominated by British forces, is now more than half controlled by the United States. The speed and scale of the American invasion are growing, and Canadian public opinion has issued a warning that Canada is becoming an American colony.

    The Dominion Bureau of Statistics' materials point out that U.S. investment's control over the Canadian economy has reached a new peak. From 1956 to 1958, approximately 44% of all new capital investment in Canada was directly supplied by foreign countries. At the end of 1957, the total investment in sectors such as manufacturing, mining, petroleum, and natural gas reached nearly 17.9 billion U.S. dollars. Of all the funds, approximately 52% was controlled by the United States, only 10% by Britain and other countries, and only 38% by Canadian capital. The intrusion of U.S. capital is concentrated in the mining industry. From 1954 to 1957, the mining industry (including smelting) controlled by the United States increased from 49% to 52%. In the petroleum and natural gas industries, the capital controlled by Canada has decreased from 31% three years ago to 24%, while U.S. control has increased from 67% to 71%. By the end of 1958, Canada's total foreign long-term investment reached 19.1 billion U.S. dollars, of which the United States accounted for 14.6 billion U.S. dollars, and Britain only accounted for 3.1 billion U.S. dollars.

    Canada's foreign trade is also completely manipulated by the United States. Figures on Canada's overseas trade published by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics show that in the first nine months of 1959, Canada's exports increased to a record 3,637,800,000 U.S. dollars, but this was almost entirely due to the increase in Canada's exports to the United States, accounting for 61.8% of Canada's total exports, while in the first nine months of last year, it only accounted for 58.3%. The proportion of British exports to Canada decreased from 15.8% to 15.4%.

    Canada's "Globe and Mail" pointed out: "This post-war trend of concentrating our trade in the United States and ignoring the rest of the world is accelerating." It also said: "Our export situation in 1959 is as disturbing as its proportions." Raw materials and semi-finished products dominate exports, and there are almost no manufactured goods exports, except for a few items such as whiskey and agricultural implements. Therefore, the newspaper sighed: "Although Canada has been stepping up its industrial development in the past two decades, in terms of foreign trade, we are still a 'colonial' country." The newspaper said that Canada is "cutting down wood and mining ore for the industrial 'processing' of the United States," which is a "situation full of danger to Canada's national future."

    The December 7th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" asked triumphantly: "Does Canada really belong to Canada?" Its reply was: Not so in industry, because two-thirds of industry is "foreign-owned - and mainly by American investors." The publication revealed that the United States will continue to expand its expansion activities in Canada.

### 美国资本控制加拿大经济  加“环球邮报”惊呼加拿大已成殖民地

    美国资本控制加拿大经济
    加“环球邮报”惊呼加拿大已成殖民地
    本报讯　据不久以前加拿大自治领统计局公布的材料，加拿大这个过去是英国势力占优势的国家的经济命脉，目前已有半数以上转入美国的控制下。美国势力入侵的速度和规模，正在越来越大，加拿大舆论发出了加拿大正在成为美国殖民地的警告。
    自治领统计局的材料指出，美国投资对加拿大经济的控制，已达到了一个新的高峰。1956年到1958年，加拿大所有新的资本投资中，大约有44％的资金是直接由外国供给。1957年底，在制造业、采矿业、石油业和天然煤气业等部门的投资总额达到将近一百七十九亿美元。全部资金中美国控制的约占52％，英国和其他国家控制的仅占10％，加拿大资本只占38％。美国资本的侵入，集中在采矿业方面。从1954年到1957年美国控制的采矿业（包括冶炼在内）从49％提高到52％。在石油和天然煤气工业方面，加拿大所控制的资本已由三年前的31％下降到24％，而美国的控制则从67％提高到71％。到1958年年底，加拿大的全部外国长期投资达到一百九十一亿美元，其中美国就占一百四十六亿美元，英国仅占三十一亿美元。
    加拿大的对外贸易也完全受到了美国的操纵。自治领统计局发表的加拿大海外贸易的数字表明，在1959年的头九个月中，加拿大的输出增加到三十六亿三千七百八十万美元的创纪录的数字，但是这种几乎全部是由于加拿大对美国输出的增加，占加拿大输出总额的61.8％，而在去年头九个月还只占到58.3％。英国在加拿大输出中所占比例却由15.8％降到15.4％。
    加拿大“环球邮报”指出：“这种战后把我们的贸易集中于美国而忽视世界其余地区的趋势，正在加速发展。”它并且说：“我们1959年各项输出情况像它们的比例情况一样使人感到不安。”输出物品中原料和半制成品占压倒地位，除威士忌酒和农具等少数几种项目外，几乎没有制成品输出。这家报纸因此叹息说：“尽管加拿大在过去二十年中在加紧发展工业，然而在对外贸易方面，我们仍然是一个
  ‘殖民地’国家”。报纸说，加拿大是为了美国的工业“加工而砍伐木材和挖掘矿石”的，这是一种对加拿大“国家前途充满危险的情况”。
    12月7日的“美国新闻与世界报道”得意洋洋地问道：“加拿大是不是真正属于加拿大呢？”它的答复是：在工业方面并非如此，因为三分之二的工业是“外国人拥有的——而主要是美国投资者”。这家刊物透露，美国将继续扩大它对加拿大的扩张活动。
