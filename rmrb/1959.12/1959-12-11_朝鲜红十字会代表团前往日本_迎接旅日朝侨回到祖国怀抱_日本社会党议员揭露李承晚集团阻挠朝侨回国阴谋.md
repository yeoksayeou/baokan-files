Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th—The delegation of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, according to the agreement signed by the Red Cross Societies of Korea and Japan regarding the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, left Chongjin by ship on the morning of the 9th for Niigata, Japan, to receive Korean residents in Japan coming to the Republic and to carry out related matters.

The delegation is headed by Li Il-kyeong, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross Society. At the request of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross Society, the 5,000-ton passenger ship "Krylion" and the 3,500-ton passenger-cargo ship "Tobolsk" from the Soviet Union went along; these two ships will transport Korean residents in Japan back to their country.

Those who saw them off at the dock included Kim Ung-gi, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross Society, members of the Central Reception Committee for Overseas Korean Compatriots in Japan, Finance Minister Song Bong-uk, Kim Cheon-hae, Chairman of the Presidium of the Fatherland Front, Song Yeong, Chairman of the Korean Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, and more than 5,000 people from all walks of life in Chongjin.

Before departure, Li Il-kyeong said in a statement, "It is thanks to the consistent and sincere efforts of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government that it has been possible to realize the wish of Korean residents in Japan to return home. People from all walks of life in Japan have given active support and assistance to the realization of the wish of Korean residents in Japan to return to their motherland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as soon as possible. The Korean people are satisfied with this support and assistance from the Japanese people and are convinced that it will contribute to the future development of friendly relations between the peoples of Korea and Japan."

He pointed out, "American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique are still struggling to sabotage the repatriation work by various malicious methods. The conscience of humanity cannot tolerate their conspiracy to violate and trample on humanitarianism." He said, "I expect that the Japanese people will continue to provide active assistance to effectively ensure the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan."

Xinhua News Agency, 9th—Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Socialist Party Diet member Kozo Inomata revealed at a meeting of the House of Representatives Legal Affairs Committee on the 8th that the Syngman Rhee group was obstructing the return of Korean residents in Japan to North Korea, and raised questions to the Japanese government on this issue.

This Diet member said that it is said that the Syngman Rhee group sent personnel from the intelligence agency into Japan from the US military base in Tachikawa, and is planning to take terrorist measures, such as planning to bomb the Japanese Red Cross Society in Niigata and the trains transporting Korean residents in Japan.

This Diet member also pointed out that it is said that Kim Young-han, the third secretary of the South Korean delegation in Japan, handed an 8 million yen check to intelligence agency personnel through Shin Cheol-seon, the fishery minister of the delegation, at a Korean restaurant in Tokyo on the 4th. He said that if this is true, it can be considered that the South Korean delegation is a base for disrupting public order in Japan, which is a major issue.

Kozo Inomata said, "We believe that the Syngman Rhee group has set up the headquarters for disrupting public order work in Toyama Prefecture, and intelligence agency personnel landed from Uki Port in Toyama Prefecture."

He demanded that the government answer the questions he raised. Japanese Minister of Justice Sakuya Ino and other relevant officials only gave vague answers.

In order to obstruct the return of Korean residents in Japan to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States and the Syngman Rhee group are doing everything possible to carry out sabotage activities. It is reported that the Syngman Rhee group made a proposal to Japan on the 5th, using the release of Japanese fishermen detained in Busan and the restoration of trade as bait, demanding that Japan reach an agreement with it to kidnap Korean residents in Japan to South Korea.

According to reports, the Japanese police authorities arrested two Syngman Rhee elements carrying explosives in Shibata City, Niigata Prefecture, on the evening of the 4th. These two Koreans attempted to bomb the repatriation reception center of the Japanese Red Cross Society in Niigata City to obstruct the return of Korean residents in Japan to North Korea. The police also confiscated four gasoline drums they had hidden at Niigata Station.

In Japan, the reactionary Korean residents' organization "Residence Group" is preparing to mobilize 1,000 people on the 10th to obstruct the first group of Korean residents in Japan from leaving Tokyo to go to Niigata City to board ships to return home. This organization also spent 100,000 yen to rent rooms in eleven hotels in Niigata City to accommodate saboteurs who went to Niigata to prevent Korean residents from boarding ships.

    朝鲜红十字会代表团前往日本
    迎接旅日朝侨回到祖国怀抱
    日本社会党议员揭露李承晚集团阻挠朝侨回国阴谋
    新华社平壤9日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国红十字会代表团根据朝日两国红十字会签订的关于旅日朝侨归国协议，为了接受前来共和国的旅日朝鲜侨民和执行有关事宜，9日上午乘船离开清津前往日本新潟。
    代表团由朝鲜红十字会中央委员会副委员长李一卿任团长。根据朝鲜红十字会中央委员会的请求由苏联来的五千吨级客轮“克利里昂”号和三千五百吨级客货轮“托波尔斯克”号同去，这两艘轮船将载运旅日朝侨回国。
    到码头送行的有，朝鲜红十字会中央委员会委员长金应基、中央迎接旅日朝侨委员会委员和财政相宋凤郁、祖国战线议长团议长金天海、朝鲜对外文化联络委员会委员长宋影和清津市各界人民五千多人。
    李一卿在出发之前发表谈话说，“由于朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府始终一贯的有诚意的努力，才有了实现旅日朝侨归国愿望的可能。日本各界人民为了旅日朝侨实现早日回到自己的祖国朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的愿望，给予了积极的支持和协助。朝鲜人民对日本人民的这种支持和协助感到满意，并确信它将为今后发展朝日两国人民间的友好关系作出贡献。”
    他指出，“美帝国主义和李承晚集团，至今还企图以各种恶毒的方法为了破坏归国工作继续进行挣扎。人类的良心决不能容许他们这种违背和蹂躏人道主义的阴谋。”他说，“我期待日本人民为了有成效地保证旅日朝侨的归国工作继续给予积极协助。”
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本社会党议员猪俣浩三8日在国会众议院法务委员会会议上揭露李承晚集团阻挠旅日朝侨回朝鲜北部，并就这个问题向日本政府提出质询。
    这位议员说，据说，李承晚集团把特务机关工作人员由美军立川基地派进日本，而且正在计划采取恐怖手段，如计划爆炸新潟的日本红十字会和运送朝侨的火车等。
    这位议员还指出，据说，南朝鲜驻日本的代表团三等秘书金永汉曾经于4日在东京的一个朝鲜菜馆里通过代表团的渔业部长申铁仙把八百万日元的支票交给了特务机关工作人员。他说，如果这是事实，就可以认为，南朝鲜代表团是扰乱日本治安的据点，这是一个重大问题。
    猪俣浩三说，我们认为，李承晚集团把扰乱治安工作的总部设在富山县，特务机关工作人员由富山县优木港登陆。
    他要求政府回答他提出的这些质问。日本法务相井野硕哉和其他有关官员都只作了空泛的答复。
    为了阻挠旅日朝鲜侨民回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，美国和李承晚集团正在千方百计进行破坏活动。有消息说，李承晚集团曾经在5日以释放拘留在釜山的日本渔民和恢复贸易为诱饵，向日本提出了一项建议，要求日本同它达成一项把旅日朝侨劫持到南朝鲜的协定。
    据报道，日本警察当局曾经在4日晚上在新潟县新发田市逮捕了两名携带炸药的李承晚分子。这两个朝鲜人企图爆炸在新潟市的日本红十字会的回国朝侨收容所，来阻挠旅日朝鲜侨民回到北朝鲜。警察还没收了他们藏在新潟车站的四个汽油桶。
    在日本的反动朝侨组织“居留民团”正在准备动员一千人在10日阻挠第一批朝侨离开东京，前往新潟市搭船回国。这个组织还花了十万日元租下新潟市的十一家旅店的房间，来安置到新潟阻挡朝侨搭船的破坏分子。
