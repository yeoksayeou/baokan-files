　　Better Participation in Enterprise Management
　　By Pan Dianhua, Worker of the Heat Treatment Group, Second Workshop, Hua'an Machinery Factory, Heilongjiang Province

    The new year is about to begin. Looking back at 1959, our factory has made considerable achievements in all aspects. In terms of enterprise management, after fully mobilizing the masses to participate in management, the workers' sense of responsibility as masters has been greatly developed, and the factory's appearance has become even more prosperous. In the past year, as a material handler, I have deeply realized that the Party's principle of mobilizing workers to participate in enterprise management is completely correct.

    In the past, our work section used a lot of materials, and management was not strict enough. Take the most consumed item, cotton gloves, for example: the leadership often issued us cotton and yarn gloves to prevent us from burning our hands when using tongs to clamp materials in the furnace. In the past, everyone did not pay much attention to saving gloves. Sometimes, after finishing work, they would take them off and throw them away casually. If they were a little damaged or dirty, they would get new ones. The entire group of fifty-eight people consumed an average of one pair per person per day. After I was elected as a material handler, I took the initiative to discuss with the leaders of the group, and used pre-shift and post-shift meetings to explain to everyone the great significance of workers participating in the daily management of the group. Everyone realized that they should not waste raw materials. I then mobilized everyone to mend old gloves, explaining that saving cotton gloves was equivalent to saving cotton cloth. Two groups of more than thirty female comrades first used their spare time to mend old gloves, and then some male comrades also joined in the mending; at first, they only sewed in the workshop, and later they even sewed when they returned to the dormitory; they started by sewing for their own group, and later they even sewed for other groups. The matter of mending old gloves quickly spread throughout the entire workshop. From January of this year to now, our group has not received any new gloves except for the sixty pairs of new gloves used for the production of special products; we have also handed over more than five hundred pairs of mended old gloves to the workshop material group.

    In my work, I often discuss with the leaders of the group and consult with everyone, and with the help of professional personnel, I have solved some problems in terms of raw material supply. For example, in January of this year, asbestos tape for heat treatment tongs (wrapping asbestos on the tong jaws to prevent burning and damage to the product) was temporarily in short supply, and it looked like it would affect production; after everyone's research, the problem was solved by using waste copper pipes to cover the tong jaws. In the past, asbestos tape needed to be replaced twice a day; after using copper pipes, some have not been replaced until now. This improvement alone has saved the country more than 5,000 yuan from January of this year to now.

    With the help of professional personnel, our group has established a registration ledger for the receipt and issuance of materials. Open the ledger, how much is received, how much is issued, who receives how much, how much is left, who wastes, and who saves, is all clear at a glance. Individual savings figures are announced once a week, and the completion of the monthly consumption target is announced at the end of the month. We also explain to everyone the material supply situation, material performance, and prices for the next month. At the same time, based on the remaining materials from the previous month and the production tasks for the next month, we mobilize everyone to formulate the material plan for the next month. Usually, people who have done well in saving materials are praised in a timely manner, and people who have wasted materials are helped to find the causes and improvement methods. Therefore, our group has developed a habit of saving materials, and we can complete the savings plan every month. Production also exceeds the target every month.

    In the continued leap forward of 1960, under the leadership of the Party, I will rely on the close cooperation of the comrades in the group and the professional management personnel in the department to participate better in enterprise management, so that the group's material management work can cooperate well with the pace of production leap forward.

　　更好地参加企业管理
　　黑龙江省华安机械厂第二车间热处理小组工人  潘殿华
    新的一年就要开始了。回顾1959年，我们厂在各方面都取得不小的成绩。在企业管理方面，经过充分发动群众参加管理，工人的主人翁责任感大大发扬，企业面貌也更加欣欣向荣。我在一年来担任材料员工作的过程中，深深体会到党的发动工人参加企业管理的原则完全正确。
    过去我们工段用的材料很多，管理不够严格。拿消耗量最大的线手套来说吧：领导方面为了使我们在烘炉上拿钳子夹料不烤伤手，经常发给我们线手套和棉手套。过去，大家用手套不大注意节约，有时候干完活便摘下来随便一扔，坏了点、脏了一些就领新的，全组五十八个人平均每人一天就得消耗一副。大伙选我当材料员以后，我主动同小组的领导同志研究，利用班前班后会向大家讲解工人参加小组日常管理工作的重大意义，大家都认识到不应该浪费原材料。我便发动大家缝补旧手套，向大家说明节约线手套，就等于节约棉布。两组三十多名女同志首先利用闲余时间动手缝补旧手套，接着有的男同志也参加缝补；起初只在车间里缝，后来回到宿舍也缝；开始缝本组的，后来连别的组也给缝了。缝补旧手套要用“布”，大家便把过去擦产品用的废破布，洗净后使用。缝补旧手套的事很快传遍了全车间。从今年1月份到现在，我们小组除了生产特殊产品领用了六十副新手套以外，没有另外领新的；我们还将缝补好的旧手套交到车间材料组五百多副。
    我在工作当中，经常同组内领导同志研究，和大伙商量，并且取得专业人员的帮助，在原材料供应方面解决了一些问题。例如今年1月份，热处理钳子用的石棉带（钳口上缠石棉既不怕烧又不会夹伤产品）一时供应不上，眼看要影响生产；经过大家研究，用废紫铜管套在钳口上，把这一问题解决了。过去用石棉带缠钳口，一天需要换两次；使用紫铜管以后，有的到现在还没有换过。仅这一项改进，从今年1月到现在，就给国家节约了五千多元。
    在专业人员的帮助下，我们小组已经建立了材料领入和发出登记账。打开账本，领入多少，发出多少，谁领多少，还剩多少，谁浪费了，谁节约了，一目了然。每周公布一次个人节约数字，月底公布全月的消耗指标完成情况。我们还向大家说明下月材料供应情况、材料性能和价格，同时根据上月剩的材料和下月的生产任务，发动大家制订下一个月的材料计划。平时对节约材料成绩好的人及时给予表扬，并帮助浪费了材料的人找出原因和改进办法。因此，我们小组在节约材料方面已经形成风气，月月都能完成节约计划。生产上也是月月超额完成任务。
    在继续跃进的1960年，我一定要在党的领导下，依靠小组同志们和科室专业管理人员的密切合作，更好地参加企业管理，使小组的材料管理工作能很好地配合生产跃进的步伐。
