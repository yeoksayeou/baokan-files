    Increase and Decrease
    Jing Yu
    It is really hard to calculate how much potential is contained in technological innovation. Every major reform brings great changes to production, and every minor reform also brings changes to production that are not insignificant.
    The Fenshuitou mining area of the Xinshao Iron Plant in Hunan Province implemented six reforms from mining to transportation and loading and unloading. These reforms were not very large, some were very small, but the changes they brought to production were great. In April, the entire mine had more than 300 people with a monthly output of only 80 tons. In October, the number of people was reduced to 90, while the monthly output soared to more than 350 tons.
    The Yong'an County Transport Company in Fujian Province realized the use of chutes for loading, unloading and transportation, which is considered a major reform, and the work efficiency increased eight times. In addition, there is a water-sprinkling log rolling method, which is a very small reform, and the work efficiency increased three times. Due to the accumulation of large and small innovations, the number of production personnel was reduced from more than 700 last year to more than 400, but the production completed was about double that of last year.
    These are two of the most common events in the countless innovations since the Great Leap Forward.
    The number of personnel in a factory has been reduced by more than half, while the output has increased by more than three times, which means that one person is doing the work of seven or eight people. If more small iron plants carry out some innovations like the Xinshao Iron Plant in light of local conditions, the national production figures will increase significantly, and the labor force will be saved significantly.
    In the past, some people, when it came to increasing production, always wanted to focus on increasing personnel, but they did not understand that reducing personnel can also increase production. Simply using the method of increasing personnel can certainly complete the task of increasing production, however, when personnel increases, the cost of the enterprise increases, and although the total output increases somewhat, the labor productivity does not increase, and may even decrease relatively. If the method of technological innovation is adopted to complete the task of increasing production, not only will production increase, personnel decrease, and labor productivity increase, but also the cost of the enterprise will decrease.
    People are the decisive factor in the development of social productive forces. Fully utilizing production efficiency is not simply about increasing personnel, but should be about trying every means to create all favorable conditions and improve the labor efficiency of each individual. Any enterprise with the conditions that does not utilize the favorable conditions, innovate technology, and improve production, but places its hope on increasing personnel is a great waste of human resources. Any enterprise without the conditions that does not actively create conditions, innovate technology, and improve production, but places its hope on waiting for conditions and external support, is also a great loss in production. Increasing production without increasing personnel or even increasing production while reducing personnel requires conditions, including political and ideological conditions and material and technical conditions. Here, the dominant position is still ideological conditions. With advanced innovative thinking, there is a prerequisite for improving material and technical conditions, and with the addition of technical improvements, it is possible to achieve increased production without increasing personnel, and even increased production while reducing personnel.
    Vigorously carrying out technological innovation—reducing personnel, increasing production, and improving labor productivity—this is the formula of increase and decrease that we need.

    增和减

    技术革新中究竟蕴藏着多大潜力，实在难以计算。每一项重大改革，给生产带来的变化固然很大，每一项微小的改革，给生产带来的变化也并不微小。
    湖南新邵铁厂分水坳矿区从采矿到运输装卸，实行了六项改革。这些改革并不很大，有的是很微小的，然而给生产带来的变化却很大。4月份全矿三百多人，月产量仅八十吨，10月份人员减少到九十人，而月产量则猛增到三百五十多吨。
    福建永安县搬运公司实现装卸运输滑槽化，这算是一项较大的改革，工效提高了八倍；另外，有一种泼水滚木法，是一项极小的改革，工效提高了三倍；由于大大小小的革新汇集一起，生产人数就由去年的七百多人减少到四百多人，生产却完成了比去年增长约一倍的任务。
    这是大跃进以来无数革新事件中两件最普通的事。
    一个厂的人员减少过半，而产量增长了三倍多，这就是一个人干了七、八个人的活。如果有更多的小型铁厂，都因地制宜地像新邵铁厂那样进行一些革新，全国的生产数字就会有显著的增长，劳动力就会有显著的节省。
    过去，有些人一提起增产，总是想在增加人上打主意，却不了解减少了人员，也可以增加生产。单纯用增加人的办法，当然也可以完成增产任务，不过，人增加了，企业的成本增加了，总的产量尽管有所增加，而劳动生产率却并未提高，甚至相对降低了。如果采用技术革新的办法来完成增产任务，不仅生产增加了，人减少了，劳动生产率提高了，企业的成本也降低了。
    人是发展社会生产力决定性的因素，充分发挥生产效能并不是单纯地增加人，而应是千方百计，创造一切有利条件，提高每个人的劳动效率。凡是具有条件的企业，如果不去利用有利条件，革新技术提高生产，而把希望寄托在增加人员上，这就是人力上的极大浪费；凡是没有条件的企业，如果不去积极创造条件，革新技术提高生产，而把希望放在等待条件、外力支援上，这也是生产上的一大损失。增产不增人或者增产又减人，都是要有条件的，包括政治思想条件和物质技术条件。这里，处于支配地位的还是思想条件，有了先进的革新的思想，就有了改进物质技术条件的前提，再加上技术的改进，就能够做到增产不增人，甚至增产还减人。
    大搞技术革新——减少人员、增加生产、提高劳动生产率，这才是我们所需要的增和减的公式。
