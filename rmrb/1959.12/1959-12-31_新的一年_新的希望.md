People's Daily, Moscow, December 30th – Amidst the joy of welcoming the New Year and bidding farewell to the old, this reporter interviewed advanced Soviet workers, collective farm chairmen, and cultural figures. They shared their achievements of 1959 and their prospects for 1960, and warmly expressed their congratulations to the Chinese working people.

	Soviet Machine Adjuster Antropov Says:
	Better Conscious Labor for Communism

	Machine adjuster Antropov, a famous inventor at the Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory, told the reporter, recalling his achievements over the past year: "This year, there are three most unforgettable events in my life: first, on May 1st, I received the glorious title of Communist Labor Shock Worker; second, I participated in the June Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee; and third, over the past year, I designed and manufactured nine automated and semi-automated lathes for the country with different purposes, most of which were made this year. An ordinary person like me, who came from a shepherd background, can achieve such results, which is due to nothing but the wise leadership of the Party and the government. The Party has cultivated me into a person who can consciously strive for the cause of communism, and the Party has created all the best conditions for our creative labor. Therefore, I will work harder to build communism."

	Then, Antropov said: "The new year of 1960 is coming. For me, it is not very common to work without thinking about creating and inventing something. My personal plan is to propose at least forty rationalization proposals within seven years that can greatly improve labor productivity. In the new year, I want to better carry out conscious creative labor for communism.

	In order to further improve my level, I will study part-time at the factory's affiliated technical school in 1960. In the new year, there is no doubt that our communist construction will achieve greater success, and our path will become wider and brighter. Here, I also wish the Chinese worker brothers greater achievements in socialist construction in the new year."

	“Vladimir Ilyich” Farm Chairman Biyanov Expresses:
	Next Year Agricultural Production Will Be a Year of Continued Upsurge

	During the days of bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the new, everywhere in the "Vladimir Ilyich" farm in the Moscow region, one can see a scene of joy. Every household and cultural palace has installed a green and evergreen fir tree. The farm's buses are full of villagers going to the city early in the morning to buy New Year's goods and gifts. And in the snowy fields, one can still see horse-drawn carts and trucks busy transporting fertilizer and feed. People are already busy striving for a greater harvest in 1960.

	These two days are the busiest for the farm chairman and Socialist Labor Hero Biyanov. Just after summarizing this year's victorious achievements, he will discuss the higher production plan for 1960. He also has to go to the state to attend meetings. Someone said: "Biyanov has already stepped into 1960".

	Biyanov replied to this with humor: "How can communist construction take a break? If we win this year, we must strive for greater victory next year. We must seize the time to carry out communist construction."

	When Biyanov talked to reporters about the farm's production achievements in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, he said: "Our farm members, like all Soviet agricultural workers, are in a huge upsurge of political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm this year. The farm is mainly engaged in animal husbandry and vegetable production. This year, the amount of meat and milk sold to the state has doubled compared with last year, and the amount of eggs has increased four times. Every villager is actively working hard under the encouragement of communist construction. For example, the two field work teams of Kolpokaur and Denisov, they are each responsible for 300 hectares of cultivated land. As a result, the yield of corn silage they planted reached about 600 quintals per hectare, entering the state's large-area high-yield record plan. Now three work teams are striving for the title of 'Communist Labor Team' and are working very well."

	When talking about the farm's production in the second year of the Seven-Year Plan, Biyanov said: "It is certain that next year's production will be better than this year. Now the farm is starting to accumulate 13,000 tons of fertilizer, striving to harvest 28 quintals of grain per hectare (15 mu). Milk and meat production will also take a big step forward. The coming year is a year of continued upsurge in Soviet agricultural production. We have full confidence that we must strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan in three to four years."

	Famous Film Director Gerasimov Talks About Next Year's Prospects:
	To Create More Works Reflecting the Appearance of People's Heroes

	On the eve of the New Year, we visited the famous Soviet film director Gerasimov at the "House of Friendship" in Moscow. He is the vice chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association and had just returned from a visit to Mexico. The energetic film artist told reporters: "1959 was not only a year of great development in Soviet economic construction, but also a year of exceptionally rich harvest in cultural construction. Due to the large-scale development of communist construction, many encouraging new events have emerged among the Soviet people. At present, all Soviet literary and art workers and film workers are focusing their attention on creating works that reflect modern life."

	Gerasimov recalled the achievements of the Soviet film industry over the past year and said: "In the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, Soviet film workers worked with all their strength. In this year, many excellent films have been praised by the audience. Not long ago, the organizing committee of the Soviet Filmmakers Association held a meeting, and everyone unanimously expressed that they would create more works in 1960 that reflect the heroic appearance of the Soviet people in communist construction." When talking about next year's plans, he said that he was preparing to make a film reflecting the achievements of Soviet science. He said that some Western filmmakers have recently often shown the destructive nature of scientific development in movies. An American film director even made a scientific fantasy film assuming the outbreak of an atomic war. He said: "Not long ago, I saw this American film. After watching it, I wanted to answer it with a film with completely opposite content. I want to show the constructive nature of scientific achievements in the film, how the crystallization of human wisdom serves human life, and promotes human progress." He wanted to spend half a year writing the script first. Not long ago, he had talks with some scholars from the Soviet Academy of Sciences and found a lot of materials. He would probably be able to start writing in half a year.

	Gerasimov first visited China ten years ago, when he participated in the filming of the historical documentary "Liberated China". Last year, he also received a medal awarded to him by our country. He said that he was very moved after receiving the medal. He very much hopes to have the opportunity to visit China again. Finally, he expressed that in the coming year of 1960, he hoped that the cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union would achieve greater success, and congratulated his Chinese colleagues on their greater achievements.

　　新的一年  新的希望
    本报莫斯科30日电　在迎新年辞旧岁的欢乐声中，记者访问了苏联先进的工人、集体农庄主席和文化界人士，他们对记者倾谈了他们在1959年取得的成就和对1960年的展望，并且热情地表示了对中国劳动人民的祝贺。
　　苏联机器调整工安特罗波夫说
　　更好地为共产主义进行自觉的劳动
    机器调整工安特罗波夫是莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车厂著名的创造发明家，他在回忆一年来的收获时对记者说：“今年，在我的生活中有三件最难忘的大事：第一是5月1日我获得了共产主义劳动突击手的光荣称号；第二是参加了苏共中央六月全会；第三件是一年多来我为国家设计制造成了九台用途不同的自动化和半自动化的车床，其中大部分是在今年制成的。像我这样一个牧童出身的普通人，能取得这样的成绩，这不是别的而是党和政府英明领导的结果。党把我培养成了一个能为共产主义事业自觉奋斗的人，党为我们创造性的劳动创造了一切最好的条件，因此我要加劲为建成共产主义而劳动。”
    接着，安特罗波夫说：“新的1960年就要来到了，对我说来，在工作中不动动脑筋创造发明些什么东西是不太习惯的。我个人的计划要在七年内至少提出四十项能大大提高劳动生产率的合理化建议。在新的一年中我要更好地为共产主义进行自觉的创造劳动。
    为了进一步提高自己的水平，1960年我要进工厂附设的工艺学校业余学习。在新的一年中，毫无疑问，我们的共产主义建设事业一定会取得更大的成绩，我们的道路越走越宽阔光明；这里我也预祝中国的工人兄弟在新的一年中，在社会主义建设中取得更大的成就。”
　　“弗拉基米尔·伊里奇”农庄主席比扬诺夫表示
　　明年农业生产将是继续高涨的一年
    在辞旧岁迎新年的日子里，莫斯科州“弗拉基米尔·伊里奇”农庄里，到处可以见到一片欢乐的景象。家家户户和文化宫里都安装起碧绿常青的枞树。农庄的公共汽车一清早就载满庄员们上城里办年货、买礼物。而在白雪皑皑的田野里，还不时见到马套车和载重汽车忙着运送积肥和饲料。人们已在为争取1960年更大丰收而繁忙着了。
    这两天要算农庄主席社会主义劳动英雄比扬诺夫最忙碌了，刚总结好今年的胜利成就，就要讨论1960年的更高生产计划。还要到州上开会。有人说：“比扬诺夫早就跨进了1960年了”。
    比扬诺夫对这一点颇有风趣的回答说：“共产主义建设那能歇脚？今年胜利了，那就要争取明年更大胜利。我们要进行共产主义建设就要争取时间。”
    比扬诺夫在与记者谈到农庄在七年计划第一年生产成就时说：“我们的农庄庄员跟全苏农业劳动者一样，今年处在政治热情和劳动热情的巨大高涨之中。农庄以畜牧业与蔬菜生产为主，这一年交售给国家的肉类与牛奶比去年增加了一倍，蛋类增加四倍。个个庄员都在共产主义建设鼓舞下积极努力。如科尔波考尔与杰尼索夫两个田间工作队吧，他们各自负责三百公顷耕地，结果他们种的玉米青贮饲料产量达到每公顷六百公担左右，进入了全州大面积高产纪录的计划。现在有三个工作队正在为争取‘共产主义劳动队’称号而努力，劳动得非常出色。”
    在谈到七年计划第二年农庄生产时，比扬诺夫说：“可以肯定地说，明年的生产要比今年更好。现在农庄开始积肥一万三千吨，争取每公顷（十五市亩）收获二十八公担谷物。牛奶和肉类生产也将大大迈进一步。即将来临的一年是苏联农业生产继续高涨的一年。我们有充分信心，一定争取要在三至四年内完成七年计划。”
　　著名电影导演格拉西莫夫谈明年展望
　　要创作更多反映人民英雄面貌的作品
    新年前夕，我们在莫斯科“友好之家”访问了苏联著名电影导演格拉西莫夫，他是苏中友好协会理事会副主席，不久前刚从墨西哥访问归来。这位精力充沛的电影艺术家向记者说：“1959年不但在苏联经济建设上是巨大发展的一年，并且在文化建设上也是收获异常丰富的一年。由于共产主义建设的大规模展开，在苏联人民中间出现了许多令人鼓舞的新鲜事件。目前苏联所有的文艺工作者和电影工作者都把自己的注意力放在创作反映现代生活的作品上。”
    格拉西莫夫回忆过去一年来苏联电影事业成绩时说：“在七年计划的第一年，苏联电影工作者是全力工作的。在这一年内，许多优秀影片得到了观众的称赞。不久前，苏联电影工作者协会筹委会举行了一次会议，大家一致表示要在1960年中创造更多的反映苏联人民在共产主义建设中的英雄面貌的作品。”在谈到明年的计划时，他说他准备摄制一部反映苏联科学成就的影片。他说，西方的一些电影工作者最近常在电影中表现科学发展的破坏性。美国的一个电影导演甚至拍摄了假设原子战争爆发后的科学想像片。他说：“不久前，我看到了这部美国影片，看过它以后，我就想用一部同它内容完全相反的片子来回答它。我要在影片中表现科学成就的建设性，表现人类智慧的结晶如何为人类的生活服务，并且促使人类前进。”他想用半年的时间先写出脚本，不久前他曾与苏联科学院的一些学者进行了谈话，并且找到了许多材料，在半年后大概就可以开始写作。
    格拉西莫夫在十年前曾首次到过我国，那时他参加了历史性纪录片“解放了的中国”的拍摄工作。去年他还得到了我国奖给他的奖章。他说，得到奖章后非常感动。他非常希望有机会再到中国访问。最后，他表示，在即将来临的1960年里，希望中苏两国的文化交流取得更大的成绩，祝贺中国的同业取得更大的成绩。
