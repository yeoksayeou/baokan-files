    U.S. Uses Military "Aid" to Intensify Cold War
    Driving Asian Vassals to Provide Cannon Fodder, Bases, and Resources

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) Under the guise of developing underdeveloped regions, the United States is strengthening its military "aid" to various regions, especially Asia. This is a step currently being taken by the United States to intensify the "Cold War."

    The Associated Press reported on November 29 that Eisenhower had determined that the total amount of foreign "aid" for next year would be approximately $4.1 billion, of which "military aid will be greatly increased," accounting for about half, while "the $2 billion allocated for economic aid also includes funds for defense support." This means that "aid" for military purposes will account for the vast majority of the total.

    The United States will continue to focus its military "aid" on Asia. According to a November 26 report by the Associated Press, the United States shipped approximately $1.8 billion worth of weapons to its Asian "allies" in the current fiscal year. When discussing the importance the United States attaches to military "aid" to Asia, the news agency said that the U.S. authorities consider Asia an "increasingly important arena of contest."

    It is reported that Draper, chairman of the U.S. President's "Foreign Aid Program Research Committee," advocated increasing U.S. military aid to the Far East, particularly to the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea, in his secret testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in order to intensify tensions in the Far East and threaten China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He emphasized that, for the United States, these two regions are "true front lines. It is a truce, not peace, at present." Draper also advocated driving Japan to intensify its arms expansion through "military aid." He said that the United States is giving Japan "military aid," and Japan "is building a fairly well-equipped army and beginning to build a small navy. Their air force is small, but it is making great strides." According to reports, the United States gave the Chiang Kai-shek clique $300 million in military "aid" last year, and military "aid" to South Korea in the last fiscal year totaled approximately $175 million. In the past four years, the United States has given Japan an average of $100 million in military "aid" each year.

    In Laos, the United States not only maintains a 30,000-strong army (including police) through military "aid," but in recent months has also used large amounts of weapons and money to expand the Sanaikone government's army in order to intensify and expand the civil war in Laos.

    In his report to Congress on the implementation of the U.S. foreign "aid" program, Eisenhower also admitted that the "direct central objective" of the U.S. foreign "aid" program is to set up military bases and deploy troops in the Far East, maintain the military alliances pieced together by the United States, and arm, train, and support the troops of its Asian "allies." In his special message to Congress on "foreign aid," Eisenhower also said that more than two-thirds of the $830 million in indirect military aid, the so-called "defense support costs," in the United States' 1960 fiscal year will be given to South Vietnam, South Korea, Turkey, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, and about one-third will be given to countries such as Iran, Thailand, and the Philippines. The message said that the purpose of this "aid" from the United States is to drive countries receiving "U.S. aid" to maintain the "troops that the United States hopes they will maintain" and make "valuable contributions" to U.S. military plans. The message also suggested allocating "special aid" to countries that the United States considers to be of "great strategic importance." Eisenhower stated that the United States would provide its military allies' troops with "indispensable conventional weapons and ammunition, highly sophisticated electronic equipment, missiles, and other new weapons."

    Grantham, Director of the Regional Mutual Assistance Office of the U.S. Department of Defense, revealed that the purpose of the U.S. military aid program in that region is not only to maintain the troops already established there, "but also to provide new weapons and training, which are considered essential to improving the military structure of the recipient country in the face of the growing potential of the enemy." U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Dillon said on March 17, while testifying for Eisenhower's 1960 fiscal year joint security plan: "We need joint military forces, bases, strategic resources, and production capacity." This means that the purpose of U.S. "foreign aid" is to exchange it for cannon fodder, bases, and strategic resources. Former U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins also openly stated that one of the factors determining how much military "aid" the United States gives to its Asian "allies" is the geographical distance between the "aided" country and the so-called "Communist-controlled countries." Recently resigned U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy also clamored on December 1 that stepping up military "aid" is "very important."

    Through military "aid," the United States directly controls many countries in Asia that are "aided." In South Vietnam, the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group," with more than 2,000 military personnel, has become the supreme ruler of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, tightly controlling South Vietnam's military, political, and economic affairs. The South Vietnamese "Times" pointed out that this advisory group "seems like a U.S. government set up next to the South Vietnamese government." In Thailand, the United States has also established a military advisory group. A large number of American personnel have entered Thailand and, under the titles of "advisors" and "experts," have infiltrated various departments of Thailand's political, economic, and military sectors to seize power. At the same time, the United States has also secretly established intelligence organizations such as the "Southeast Asia Supply Company," a branch of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, to secretly train "underground armed forces," collect intelligence, and monitor the activities of the Thai people. Thai Member of Parliament Nai Klai Narapati accused the United States of intensifying its interference in Thailand's internal affairs, saying that U.S. "experts" controlled various Thai government departments like a spider web. In Iran, the United States has built a large number of military projects. "U.S. News & World Report" wrote: "A country that was once within the British 'sphere of influence' has now become the American 'sphere of influence.'"

### 美国利用军事“援助”加剧冷战  驱使亚洲仆从提供炮灰、基地和资源

    美国利用军事“援助”加剧冷战
    驱使亚洲仆从提供炮灰、基地和资源
    本报讯　美国在开发不发达地区的幌子下，加强对各个地区特别是亚洲地区的军事“援助”。这是目前美国加剧“冷战”的一个步骤。
    美联社11月29日报道，艾森豪威尔已确定明年对外“援助”总数为四十一亿美元左右，其中“军事援助大大增加”，约占一半，而“拨作经济援助的二十亿美元还包括用于防御支持的款项”。这就是说，用于军事目的的“援助”将占全数的绝大部分。
    美国仍将把军事“援助”的重点放在亚洲。据美联社11月26日的消息说，在本财政年度，美国运给它的亚洲“盟友”的武器为十八亿美元左右。这家通讯社在谈到美国重视对亚洲的军事“援助”时说，美当局认为亚洲是“日益重要的角逐场”。
    据报道，美国总统“援外计划研究委员会”主席德莱柏在众议院外交委员会秘密作证时曾鼓吹增加美国对远东地区、特别是对台湾蒋介石集团和南朝鲜李承晚集团的军事援助，以加剧远东紧张局势和威胁中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。他强调说，对美国说来，这两个地区是“真正的前线。目前是休战而不是和平”。德莱柏还鼓吹通过“军事援助”驱策日本加紧扩充军备。他说，美国正在给予日本以“军事援助”，而日本“正在建立一支相当精良的陆军和开始建立一支小规模的海军。他们的空军规模小，但是正在大踏步前进”。有消息说，美国去年给蒋介石集团军“援”三亿美元，在上个财政年度对南朝鲜的军事“援助”约计一亿七千五百万美元，而在过去的四年中，美国每年平均给日本一亿美元的军事“援助”。
    在老挝，美国不仅以军事“援助”维持着一支三万人的军队（包括警察），而在最近几个月中更以大量武器和金钱来扩充萨纳尼空政府的军队，以加剧和扩大老挝内战。
    艾森豪威尔在向国会提出关于美国对外“援助”计划执行情况的报告时也承认，美国对外“援助”计划的“直接中心目标”是在远东设置军事基地和部署军队，维系美国拼凑的军事同盟，武装、训练和支持它的亚洲“盟国”的部队。艾森豪威尔在向国会提出关于“援外”的特别咨文中又说，美国在1960年度的间接军事援助，即所谓“防御支持费用”的八亿三千多万美元中三分之二以上将给予南越、南朝鲜、土耳其和台湾蒋介石集团，约三分之一给予伊朗、泰国、菲律宾等国。咨文说，美国这种“援助”的目的是要驱使接受“美援”的国家维持美国“希望它们维持的部队”，对美国的军事计划作出“有价值的贡献”，咨文还建议拨出“特别援助”给予那些美国认为在战略上有“极大重要性”的国家。艾森豪威尔表示美国要向它的军事盟国的部队“提供不可缺少的常规武器和弹药、极复杂的电子装备、导弹和其他新式武器”。
    美国国防部地区互助处处长格兰瑟姆透露，美国对那个地区的军事援助计划的目的不仅是为了保持已经在那里所建立的军队，“而且还是为了提供新式武器和训练，这种新式武器和训练被认为是对在日益增长的敌人的潜力的面前改进接受国的军事结构十分重要的”。美国负责经济事务的副国务卿狄龙3月17日在为艾森豪威尔的1960年财政年度的共同安全计划作证时说：“我们需要联合军事力量、基地、战略资源和生产能力。”这就是说，美国“援外”的目的是要换取炮灰、基地和战略资源。前美国陆军参谋长柯林斯也公然说，决定美国给予它的亚洲“盟国”的军事“援助”多少的因素之一是受“援”国同所谓“共产党控制的国家”的地理距离。最近辞职的美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊12月1日还叫嚷加紧进行军事“援助”是“十分重要的”。
    通过军事“援助”，美国直接控制了亚洲许多被“援助”的国家。在南越，拥有二千多名军事人员的美国“军事援助顾问团”成了吴庭艳政权的太上皇，它紧紧地控制着南越的军事、政治和经济。南越“时论报”指出，这个顾问团“好像设置在南越政府旁边的一个美国政府”。在泰国，美国也设立了军事顾问团。大批的美国人员进入泰国，以“顾问”、“专家”等头衔渗透到泰国的政治、经济、军事等各个部门中掌握大权。同时，美国还在泰国秘密设立了作为美国中央情报局分支机构的“东南亚供应公司”等特务组织，秘密训练“地下武装”、搜集情报和侦察泰国人民的活动。泰国议员乃克莱·纳拉帕蒂指责美国加紧干涉泰国内政说，美国的“专家”像蜘蛛网一样控制了泰国各个政府部门。在伊朗，美国建造了大量军事工程，“美国新闻与世界报道”写道：“一个一度是英国‘势力范围’之内的国家，现在已经变成美国的‘势力范围’了”。
