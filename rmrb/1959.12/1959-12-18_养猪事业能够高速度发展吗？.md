Can Hog Raising Develop at High Speed?

The pig is the head of the six domestic animals. The great significance of developing the hog-raising industry at high speed was discussed in this newspaper yesterday. The question now is whether it is possible to develop the hog-raising industry at high speed, and whether it is possible to greatly increase the number of pigs on hand in a relatively short period of time. Today, this newspaper publishes news about the rapid development of hog-raising in Xinle County, Hebei Province, and Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, which convincingly answers this question.

Xinle County, Hebei Province, now has more than 1.06 million pigs, an increase of 2.4 times over last year, reaching 11 heads per household, 2.3 heads per person, and 1.04 heads per mu, making it the first county in Hebei Province to achieve one pig per mu. Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, now has more than 350,000 pigs, an increase of two times over the beginning of this year, reaching 5.4 heads per household, 1.28 heads per person, and one head per mu. The situation in these two counties proves that it is entirely possible to increase the number of pigs on hand by one or two times within a year. What is true for one county is also true for one province. For example, in Shanxi Province, the hog-raising industry used to be relatively backward. After the Party and the government actively promoted and supported it after liberation, the number of pigs on hand only increased from about 600,000 in 1952 to about 800,000 in 1957. In five years, the number of pigs only increased by 33%. From the Great Leap Forward last year to the continued Leap Forward this year, Shanxi Province has fundamentally changed its backward situation in hog raising, turning low speed into high speed. Now the province has a total of 3.03 million pigs on hand. The number of pigs has increased more than threefold in two years. Some people may think that Shanxi is a mountainous area with abundant wild plants and sufficient feed, so the hog-raising industry has developed so quickly. Is it only in mountainous areas that the hog-raising industry can develop quickly? Not at all. Hebei, Shandong, Henan and other provinces are mostly plains, and the hog-raising industry in these areas has developed equally rapidly, even faster than in mountainous areas. From March to October this year, the number of pigs on hand in Hebei Province increased by about 80%, and in Shandong Province, it also increased by 46% during the same period. Henan Province has developed even more rapidly. The number of pigs on hand in the province at the end of June was still 6.63 million, but by late November, it had risen to 11.89 million. In less than half a year, the net increase rate reached more than 79%. Among them, in the first twenty days of November, a total of 2.73 million heads were added, an average daily increase of 136,000 heads.

Is it only in the northern provinces that the hog-raising industry can develop quickly? Also, not at all. The southern provinces and regions have very good natural conditions, a mild climate, and many places are evergreen all year round with abundant feed, so the hog-raising industry has developed even more rapidly. Jiangxi Province has added a total of 1.64 million pigs in the last two months (October and November), developing at a rate of more than 27,000 heads per day on average. The development speed of the hog-raising industry in Shangrao Prefecture of this province is particularly encouraging. More than 10,000 collective pig farms were established in Shangrao Prefecture during the same period, and the requirement that communes, management districts, production teams, and production squads all have pig farms has been realized. Now this prefecture raises a total of 1.78 million pigs, an increase of two times over September. The hog-raising industry in the suburbs of cities can also develop at high speed. The number of pigs on hand in the suburbs of Shanghai in the first ten months of this year increased by 92% compared with the end of last year. It is not necessary to list more examples of high-speed development of hog-raising in various places. Many advanced areas and advanced units with high-speed development of hog-raising not only appear in mountainous areas, but also in plains; not only in the north, but also in the south. From the facts of high-speed development of hog-raising in many places, it is entirely possible to draw such a conclusion: in all parts of the country, the hog-raising industry can achieve high speed.

However, from a national perspective, the development speed of our hog-raising industry is still unbalanced. In many areas, the number of pigs raised this year has increased by half, one time, or even more; but in many other areas, the increase has been relatively slow. How to overcome this imbalance and enable the temporarily lagging areas to quickly catch up with the advanced areas? In order to solve this problem, it is very necessary to study the experiences of areas and units with rapid development of the hog-raising industry.

Hog raising, like many other things, is something that must overcome many difficulties to be done well. For example, funds, pig breeds, pig pens, feed, feeding, disease prevention, etc., are all difficulties. But there can be two completely different attitudes towards these difficulties. One attitude is to regard difficulties as the driving force for progress, fight against difficulties in every possible way with great fearlessness, and finally conquer the difficulties, achieve new success, and push the cause forward. This is the communist attitude. The other attitude is to regard difficulties as obstacles to progress, not to advance in the face of difficulties, but to retreat in the face of difficulties. This is the attitude of cowards and lazy people. The reason why the hog-raising industry in many advanced areas and advanced units has developed so quickly is not because there are no difficulties there, but because they are not afraid of difficulties and have conquered one difficulty after another. The key is only one, that is, they have a great drive. No matter what you do, drive is always the most important issue, and it is the key to the success or failure of the matter. With drive, you will not be afraid of difficulties, you will dare to despise difficulties, and you will be able to think of ways to overcome difficulties. Procrastination, numerous difficulties, this is also impossible, that can not be done, these are the worldview of cowards and lazy people, there is no similarity with the lofty aspirations of Marxism-Leninism, and it is a world apart from the communist style. Drive is putting politics in command. When cadres have sufficient drive, they can improve and strengthen their leadership over the hog-raising industry; when the masses have sufficient drive, they can participate in the hog-raising industry with greater enthusiasm. Once these two forces of drive are combined, they will form a vigorous hog-raising upsurge. Once putting politics in command is combined with vigorously launching mass movements, and the broad masses of the people truly take action, all difficulties will be solved easily, the hog-raising upsurge will immediately appear, and the development of the hog-raising industry will immediately appear at high speed. The fact that Kuixingzhuang in Hebei Province has developed the hog-raising industry at high speed is one of thousands of typical examples. Kuixingzhuang is a small village with only forty-one households, and it is now a production team of Wangqiansi People's Commune in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province. This production team used only ten months to develop from seventeen pigs to two hundred and fifty-seven pigs. The number of pigs increased sharply by fourteen or five times in the short period of ten months. Are there no difficulties there? It should be said that the process of suddenly increasing from seventeen pigs to two hundred and fifty-seven pigs contains countless difficulties, large and small. However, the problem is obviously not whether there are difficulties or how many difficulties there are, the problem is that they have the style of communists and the lofty aspirations of Marxism-Leninism. They did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties, but moved forward in the face of difficulties, fully mobilizing the masses, so that one difficulty after another was solved. No funds? Cadres took the lead in investing, and the masses immediately responded. No pig pens? The commune members collected broken bricks and wood, and used poor methods to build simple collective pig farms. No feed? The commune members took out the yam vines, corn cobs and cotton scraps they had collected and gave them to the pigs in the team to get through the winter. The cadres said: "No matter how great the difficulty is, as long as we look downwards and rely on the masses, we can solve it." This is the secret of their success. They did it this way, and they succeeded. Many other places that have done this have also succeeded. This, it should be said, is the most fundamental experience for many places to achieve high-speed development of the hog-raising industry.

Now the situation for the great development of the hog-raising industry is extremely good. The hog-raising industry has been universally valued, and there are also many typical examples of high-speed development of the hog-raising industry. We believe that as long as everyone stirs up greater revolutionary drive and conscientiously implements the hog-raising policy of "public raising as the main focus, with public and private efforts combined," the new upsurge of hog-raising will soon spread to every corner of the country, and our country's hog-raising industry will be able to develop at high speed.

### 养猪事业能够高速度发展吗？

    养猪事业能够高速度发展吗？
    猪为六畜之首，高速度发展养猪事业的重大意义，本报昨天已经论述过了。现在的问题是能不能高速度发展养猪事业，能不能在比较短的时间内大大增加猪的存栏头数。今天本报发表河北省新乐县和江西省玉山县养猪事业迅速发展的新闻，很有说服力地回答了这个问题。
    河北省新乐县现有猪一百零六万多头，比去年增长了二点四倍，达到了每户十一头，每人二点三头，每亩地一点零四头，是河北省第一个实现了一亩地一头猪的县。江西省玉山县现有猪三十五万余头，比今年初增长了两倍，达到了每户五点四头，每人一点二八头，每亩地一头。这两个县的情况证明，一年内使猪的存栏数增长一倍、两倍是完全可能的。一个县的情况如此，一个省的情况也是这样。例如山西省，这个省过去养猪事业比较落后，解放后经过党和政府积极提倡和扶持，到1957年存栏猪数才由1952年的六十万头增加到八十万头左右，五年时间猪的头数仅仅增长了33％。从去年大跃进到今年的继续跃进，山西省的养猪从根本上改变了自己的落后面貌，低速度一变而为高速度。现在全省存栏猪数达到了三百零三万头。两年之内猪的头数增加了两倍多。也许有人会认为山西是山区，野生植物丰富，饲料充足，所以养猪业才发展得这样快。是不是只有山区的养猪业才发展得快呢？完全不是，河北、山东、河南等省大都是平原，而这些地区的养猪业发展得同样迅速，甚至比山区发展得还要快。河北省从今年3月到10月，猪的存栏数增长了80％左右，山东省在同一时间，也增长了46％。河南省发展得更为迅速，全省6月底的存栏猪数还是六百六十三万头，到11月下旬就上升为一千一百八十九万头，时间不到半年，纯增率达到79％以上。其中11月份的前二十天内，共增加二百七十三万头，平均每日增加十三万六千头。
    是不是只有北方各省的养猪业才能够发展得很快呢？也完全不是。南方各省区自然条件很好，气候温和，有许多地方四季常青，饲料丰富，养猪事业发展得更是迅速。江西省最近两个月内（10月和11月）共增加猪一百六十四万头，以每天平均增加二万七千多头的速度向前发展着。这个省的上饶专区养猪业的发展速度尤其令人振奋。上饶专区同一时间内建立起了一万多个集体养猪场，已经实现了社、管理区、生产队和生产小队都有养猪场的要求。现在这个专区共养猪一百七十八万头，比9月份增加了两倍。城市郊区的养猪业同样也能够高速度地发展，上海郊区今年头十个月猪的存栏头数比去年底增加了92％。这里不必更多地列举各地高速度发展养猪业的事例了。许许多多的养猪业高速度发展的先进地区和先进单位，不仅出现在山区，也出现在平原；不仅北方有，南方也有。从这许多地方的高速度发展养猪的事实中，完全可以得出这样的结论：在全国一切地方，养猪事业都能出现高速度。
    但是，从全国范围看来，我们的养猪事业的发展速度还是不平衡的。有许多地区，今年的养猪头数增加了半倍、一倍，甚至更多；但也有不少地区增加得比较慢。怎样克服这种不平衡，使暂时落后了的地区迅速赶上先进地区呢？为了解决这个问题，研究一下养猪事业发展得快的地区和单位的经验是十分需要的。
    养猪这件事和其他许多事情一样，是一桩要克服重重困难才能做好的事情。例如资金、猪种、猪舍、饲料、饲养、防治病疫等等这一切都是困难。但是对于这些困难，可以有两种完全不同的态度。一种态度是把困难看作前进的动力，大无畏地千方百计地同困难作斗争，终于征服了困难，取得了新的成功，把事业推进一步。这是共产主义的态度。另一种态度是把困难看作前进的障碍，不是知难而进，而是知难而退。这是懦夫懒汉的态度。许多养猪的先进地区、先进单位的养猪事业之所以发展得快，并不是因为他们那里没有困难，而是因为他们不怕困难，把一个个困难都征服了。关键只有一个，那就是他们有一个很大的干劲。无论办什么事情，干劲总是第一重要的问题，它是事情成败的关键。有了干劲才能不怕困难，才敢于蔑视困难，才能够想出克服困难的办法。拖拖沓沓，困难重重，这也不可能，那也办不到，这些都是懦夫和懒汉的世界观，与马克思列宁主义的雄心壮志没有丝毫相同之点，与共产主义风格相去十万八千里。干劲就是政治挂帅。干部干劲足，便能够改善和加强对养猪业的领导；广大群众干劲足，便能够以更大的热情参加养猪事业。这两股干劲一经结合起来，便会形成一个轰轰烈烈的养猪高潮。政治挂帅同大搞群众运动一经结合，广大群众真正行动起来了，一切困难便会迎刃而解，养猪高潮马上便会出现，养猪业的发展也马上便会出现高速度。河北省魁星庄高速度发展养猪业的事实就是千万个典型事例中的一个。魁星庄是一个只有四十一户的小村，现在是河北省吴桥县王谦寺人民公社的一个生产队。这个生产队只用了十个月的时间，就从十七头猪发展到了二百五十七头，十个月的短短时间内猪的头数就猛增了十四、五倍。他们那里没有困难吗？应当说，从十七头猪一下子猛增到二百五十七头这个过程包含着大大小小无数的困难。可是，问题显然不在于有无困难或者困难多少，问题在于他们有共产主义者的风格，有马克思列宁主义的雄心大志。他们不是在困难面前低头，而是迎着困难前进，充分发动群众，于是，一个个的困难都解决了。没有资金吗？干部带头投资，群众立即响应。没有猪圈吗？社员们凑了碎砖和木料，利用穷办法盖起了简易的集体养猪场。没有饲料吗？社员们将自己收藏的山药蔓、玉米骨和棉花落都拿出来，让队里的猪度过冬天。干部们说：“天大的困难，只要眼睛向下，依靠群众，就能解决”。这就是他们获得成功的秘诀。他们这样办，成功了。别的许多地方凡是这样做的，也成功了。这一条，应当说，就是许多地方养猪业获得高速度发展的最根本的经验。
    现在养猪事业大发展的形势极好，养猪业已经受到普遍重视，又有了许多高速度发展养猪事业的典型，我们相信，只要大家鼓起更大的革命干劲，认真贯彻“公养为主，公私并举”的养猪方针，养猪的新高潮很快就会遍及全国每一角落，我国的养猪事业就能够高速度地发展。
