    With Teachers' Help
    Peking University Students Revise "A History of Chinese Literature"
    In the Great Leap Forward last year, the 1955 class of the Literature Specialization Department of the Chinese Department of Peking University compiled a 750,000-word "A History of Chinese Literature," which received attention from the academic community. In March and April of this year, the Writers Association, the Institute of Literature, Beijing Normal University, Peking University, and other relevant units jointly held several symposia to systematically offer opinions on this history of literature. The 1955 class then spent nearly five months revising it with the help and guidance of teachers from the Chinese Literature History Teaching and Research Section.
    During the revision process, they read more than 3,270 classical literary works and author collections, 840 Marxist-Leninist literary theory works and thematic papers, and conducted more than 340 discussions on more than 30 important issues. Now, the history of literature has increased from 750,000 words to 1.24 million words in length, the materials are richer, and the discussions are more profound. According to Feng Guanyun and Fei Zhengang's "'Several Understandings in the Revision of 'A History of Chinese Literature'" in the fourth issue of the "Peking University Journal (Humanities)" in 1959, and Yang Hui et al.'s "Talking About the Revised Edition of 'A History of Chinese Literature'" in the 22nd issue of "Frontline," this history of literature has been revised on some important points. For example, the law of the struggle between the people's progressive literature and the anti-people's reactionary literature in the history of Chinese literature has replaced the original book's claim of the law of the struggle between realism and anti-realism in the history of Chinese literature. The revised edition also abandoned the idea that folk literature is the mainstream or orthodox of Chinese literature, and placed folk literature in the position of a component of the people's progressive literature, and so on, which strengthens the persuasiveness of the arguments. The revision of this history of literature has also absorbed the new academic research results of the past year. Therefore, its appearance marks a major step forward in the writing of a scientific history of Chinese literature.

    在教师帮助下
    北大学生修订“中国文学史”
    北京大学中文系文学专门化1955级学生，在去年大跃进中间，编写了一部七十五万字的“中国文学史”，受到了学术界的重视，今年3、4月间，作家协会、文学研究所、师大、北大等有关单位联合举行了几次座谈会，对这部文学史系统地提出了意见。1955级学生又用了将近五个月的时间，在中国文学史教研室教师的帮助和指导下，进行了修改工作。
    在修改过程中，他们阅读了三千二百七十多部古典文学作品和作家专集，八百四十篇马克思列宁主义文艺理论著作、专题论文，就三十几个重要问题进行了三百四十多次的讨论。现在这部文学史在篇幅上从七十五万字增加到了一百二十四万字，材料也更加丰富了，论述也更加深刻了。据“北京大学学报（人文科学）”1959年第四期冯馆芸、费振刚等的“‘中国文学史’修改中的几点认识”和“前线”第二十二期杨晦等的“谈‘中国文学史’修订本”中谈到，这部文学史在一些重要的论点上已作了修改，譬如以人民的进步文学与反人民的反动文学在中国文学史中的斗争的规律，代替了原书中的现实主义和反现实主义在中国文学史中的斗争的规律的提法。修订本也放弃了民间文学是中国文学的主流或正宗的说法，而把民间文学安排在人民的进步文学的组成部分的地位上，等等，这就使得论断的说服力加强了。这部文学史的修订，还吸取了一年来新的学术研究成果，因此，它的出现，标志着向科学的中国文学史的写作方面迈进了一大步。
