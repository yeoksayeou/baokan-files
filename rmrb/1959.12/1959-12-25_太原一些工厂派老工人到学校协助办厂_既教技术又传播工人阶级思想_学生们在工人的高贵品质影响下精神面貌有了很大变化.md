The following is the translation of the article:

　　Taiyuan News – In the process of assisting various secondary schools in running factories, some factories in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, sent veteran workers and outstanding workers to the schools, which not only helped the schools overcome technical difficulties in running factories, but also spread the ideology of the working class among the students.

　　The sixty-one factories of various secondary schools in Taiyuan City have all developed through factory-school cooperation. A total of nineteen factories participated in the cooperation. In the process of cooperation, these factories all regarded educating the next generation as their own responsibility. They not only allocated a part of their machinery to equip the school factories, but also sent three hundred and fourteen veteran workers and outstanding workers from their factories to the schools. These workers had relatively high technical skills and ideological awareness. After arriving at the schools, they taught students technology meticulously and patiently, so the students could quickly master various production technologies. Many students studying mechanics could independently operate lathes after being taught by them for only two days. Before the master craftsmen came, the automobile repair shop of the Third Middle School could only carry out automobile maintenance work. After the Shanxi Automobile Manufacturing Factory sent master craftsmen, the students of the Third Middle School not only learned the small and medium repair techniques of automobiles in only six months, but also were able to carry out major repairs. This made the small factory, which was originally not a proper operation, a vital force in the automobile repair industry in Taiyuan City.

　　These workers are not only technical teachers for students in labor but also disseminators of the working-class ideology. Liu Laifu and Jia Fan, two master craftsmen in the Twelfth Middle School, are both veteran workers with more than 30 years of service. Their noble qualities of not complaining, not boasting about their achievements, and selflessly working have had a profound impact on the students of the whole school. The students all regard them as role models. The original organization and discipline of some classes in the Twelfth Middle School were poor. When the students in these classes saw that the twelve technical workers sent by the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory had not been late or left early once in the past year, they were very moved. The teachers seized this example in time to carry out discipline education, so that the students quickly reversed the past phenomenon of often being late and absent from classes. Students of the Seventh Middle School, because they saw the master craftsmen in labor always leaving the difficulties to themselves and giving the convenience to others when something happened, gradually formed a good atmosphere of "leaving the trouble to themselves and giving the convenience to others." Many students who originally had good grades also automatically reviewed that they had not helped their classmates enough in the past and would actively help their classmates to make progress together in the future.

　　Because these workers have a strong sense of ownership, they pay great attention to conducting political and ideological education for students in both labor and daily life. If anyone carelessly throws away a pair of gloves, a screw, or does not abide by the operating procedures in labor, they seize the opportunity to educate students on cherishing state property and abiding by labor discipline. Once, after assigning labor to a class in the third grade of junior high school in the Thirteenth Middle School, some students did not study hard. Master Zhou Jixian gathered these students and talked about everything from the production as a whole to the situation of being beaten and unable to learn technology when he was an apprentice in the factory of a capitalist in Tianjin forty years ago. This gave these students a profound class education and communist ideological education, quickly setting off a wave of learning. In order to give students more education, various schools also regularly hold heart-to-heart talks and life meetings between master craftsmen and students in production labor. After each stage of labor, a appraisal meeting should also be organized for students and master craftsmen, so that every student can hear the master craftsmen's opinions on themselves, so that every student can clarify the direction of their future efforts.

　　Under the influence and guidance of these workers, the mental outlook of the students has changed greatly. In the past, students only had an abstract understanding of the greatness and nobility of the working class from books, but now they have truly and concretely realized it. In the past, many students lacked feelings for workers and peasants and felt ashamed to go out of the school gate wearing work clothes, but now they feel that it is an honor. In the past, there were few articles praising the working people in composition books, but now such articles appear in large numbers in composition books. In the past, bad habits such as being late, leaving early, quarreling, and talking in class that often occurred among students have also been greatly reduced. (Attached Pictures)

### 太原一些工厂派老工人到学校协助办厂  既教技术又传播工人阶级思想  学生们在工人的高贵品质影响下精神面貌有了很大变化

　　太原一些工厂派老工人到学校协助办厂
    既教技术又传播工人阶级思想
    学生们在工人的高贵品质影响下精神面貌有了很大变化
    本报太原讯　山西太原市一些工厂在协助各中等学校办工厂的过程中，把老工人和优秀工人派到学校里去，既帮助学校克服了办厂中的技术困难，又在学生中传播了工人阶级的思想。
    太原市各中等学校的六十一个工厂，都是通过厂校协作发展起来的。参加协作的工厂共有十九个。这些工厂在协作过程中，都把教育下一代当作自己的责任，不仅抽出了一部分机器武装了学校工厂，而且把自己工厂里的三百一十四名老工人和优秀工人派进了学校。这些工人技术水平和思想觉悟都比较高，到学校以后，向学生传授技术，既细致，又耐心，学生们因此都能很快掌握各种生产技术。很多学机工的学生只要他们教上两天，就能上车床独立操作。第三中学的汽车修理厂在没有老师傅以前，只能进行汽车的保养工作，山西省汽车制造厂派来了老师傅以后，只半年多的工夫，第三中学的学生不仅学会了汽车的小修、中修技术，而且已经能进行大修。使这个原来不成个摊子的小工厂现在成为太原市汽车修理业中的一支生力军。
    这些工人不仅是学生在劳动中的技术老师，而且是工人阶级思想的传播人。第十二中学里的刘来福和贾璠两位老师傅，都是三十多年工龄的老工人，他们那种不叫苦、不表功、忘我劳动的高贵品质对全校学生影响极深，学生们都把他们当作自己学习的榜样。第十二中学原来有的班组织性纪律性较差，当这些班的学生看到山西机床厂派来的十二名技术工人一年来没有发生过一次迟到早退的现象，很受感动，老师们及时抓住这个事例进行纪律教育，使学生们很快扭转了过去经常迟到、缺课的现象。第七中学的学生，由于在劳动中看到老师傅们，遇到发生什么事情，总是把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，因此也逐渐形成一种“把麻烦留给自己，把方便让给别人”的好风气，不少原来功课好的学生，还自动检查了过去帮助同学不够，今后要积极帮助同学共同进步。
    这些工人由于有强烈的主人翁感，所以无论在劳动中和日常生活中，都非常注意对学生进行政治思想教育。在劳动中谁要是随便丢掉一副手套，一个螺丝钉，或在劳动中不遵守操作规程，他们就抓紧机会向学生进行爱护国家财产和遵守劳动纪律的教育。有一回，第十三中学初中三年级的一个班在分配劳动以后，一部分学生不好好学习，周继先老师傅就把这部分学生召集起来，从生产一盘棋讲起，一直讲到他四十年前在天津资本家工厂里当徒弟挨打受气学不到技术的情况，使这部分学生受到了一次深刻的阶级教育和共产主义思想教育，迅速掀起了学习热潮。为了使学生受到更多的教育，各个学校在生产劳动中，还经常举行老师傅和学生的谈心会和生活会。每一阶段劳动完了以后，也要组织学生和老师傅开一次鉴定会，让每一个学生都能听到老师傅对自己的意见，使每一个学生都明确自己今后努力的方向。
    学生们在这些工人的影响和教导下，精神面貌变化很大。过去学生只是从书本上抽象地了解工人阶级的伟大和高尚，现在他们真正具体地体会到了；过去不少学生缺乏工农感情，穿上了工作服就羞得不敢出校门，现在反觉得这是一种光荣。过去作文本上很少有歌颂劳动人民的文章，现在这种文章大批的出现在作文本上；过去学生中经常发生的迟到、早退、吵架、上课说话等等坏习惯，现在也大大减少了。（附图片）
