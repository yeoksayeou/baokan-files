Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: The agricultural cooperativization movement, technical reform movement, and production development movement launched by the broad masses of farmers in North Vietnam under the leadership of the Labor Party have achieved brilliant successes.

Truong Chinh, Member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, pointed out at a meeting convened by the Party Central Committee in Hanoi on the 7th to review the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives in the autumn of 1959 and discuss the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives that the agricultural cooperativization movement in North Vietnam has developed extremely rapidly and has achieved great victories in recent months.

In his opening remarks at the meeting, Truong Chinh said that after this year's autumn cooperative establishment movement, there are currently 26,829 agricultural production cooperatives in North Vietnam, and the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives accounts for 41.6% of the total number of farmer households in North Vietnam. At the beginning of this year, farmer households joining agricultural cooperatives only accounted for 21% of the total number of farmer households, increasing nearly twofold in just a few months. He said that this is an extremely rapid rate of development and a great victory.

Truong Chinh emphasized that the current focus of work is to closely integrate winter-spring production to consolidate all agricultural cooperatives. This key link should be grasped to do a good job.

Tran Huu Duc, Member of the Central Committee of the Labor Party and Minister of the Central Rural Work Department, delivered a report to the meeting on "Reviewing the Establishment of Cooperatives in the Autumn of 1959 and Current Agricultural Cooperativization Tasks."

According to reports, North Vietnam is currently vigorously consolidating agricultural cooperatives. The Phu Tho Provincial Party Committee has put forward many specific measures to strengthen socialist education for cooperative members and improve the technical and cultural level of cadres. While focusing on consolidating agricultural cooperatives, the Nam Dinh Provincial Party Committee has launched a competition campaign in all agricultural cooperatives throughout the province to summarize late-season production experience and do a good job in winter-spring production. Some provincial and county Party committees have sent cadres to the countryside to strengthen the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.

Tran Huu Duc, Member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Minister of the Central Rural Work Department, recently told a Vietnam News Agency reporter that North Vietnam is advancing along the socialist road after completing the national democratic revolution. In this stage, agricultural cooperativization and the development of agricultural production are a major link.

Tran Huu Duc said that we have achieved great successes in recent years, and have brought about extremely good new changes in many aspects since 1958. These changes are manifested in the countryside as: changing production relations, reforming production technology, and developing production. These three movements are closely linked and promote each other's development.

Tran Huu Duc emphasized that the major victories achieved in agricultural cooperativization have greatly strengthened the socialist forces in the countryside, further repelled the spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside, and created conditions for the development of the cooperativization movement in 1960.

Tran Huu Duc said that on the basis of the rapid development of the cooperativization movement, the technical reform movement has also made great progress compared with the past. The yield and unit area yield of many crops have been increased. Especially for rice, the average annual yield in 1958 reached 2,048 kilograms per hectare, the average early rice yield in 1959 reached 2,070 kilograms per hectare, and the average late rice yield reached 2,500 kilograms per hectare. The average annual yield can reach 2,300 kilograms per hectare. In 1939, during the French colonial rule, the average yield in the entire North was only 1,300 kilograms per hectare. In addition, the production of coarse grains, cash crops, animal husbandry, breeding, forestry, and fishery has also developed compared with the past.

He said that if compared with South Vietnam, it can be seen more clearly that our agricultural production has developed rapidly. In 1939, the total rice output in the South was 4.1 million tons, while the total output in the North at that time was only 2.4 million tons. In 1958, the North increased to 4.576 million tons, while the South decreased to 3.9 million tons. This year, the total output in the North is expected to reach approximately 5.2 million tons.

When talking about the future tasks in the countryside, Tran Huu Duc pointed out that in the cooperativization movement, after the autumn cooperative establishment movement ends, the focus of work should shift to consolidating agricultural cooperatives, and we must continue to vigorously consolidate and develop mutual aid teams to create conditions for the further development of the movement in 1960. In terms of technical reform, we must actively and appropriately implement the comprehensive production-increasing technical measures proposed in the winter-spring production plan based on existing experience.

    越南农业合作化和增产运动比翼飞
    目前入社农户已占农户总数百分之四十以上，几个月内增加近一倍
    今年稻谷总产量可达五百二十万吨，平均每公顷产量二千三百公斤
    本报综合报道　据新华社河内电：越南北方广大农民在劳动党领导下掀起的农业合作化运动、技术改革运动和发展生产运动已经取得了辉煌的成就。
    越南劳动党中央委员会委员长征7日在劳动党中央在河内召开的检查1959年秋季建立农业生产合作社运动情况和讨论巩固农业社问题的会议上指出，越南北方农业合作化运动发展极快，几个月来已取得了巨大的胜利。
    长征在会上致开幕词时说，经过今年的秋季建社运动，目前，越南全北方已经有二万六千八百二十九个农业生产合作社，入社农户占北方农户总数的41.6％。而在今年年初加入农业社的农户只占农户总数的21％，在短短几个月内，增加将近一倍。他说，这是一个极快的发展速度，是一个巨大的胜利。
    长征强调指出，当前的工作重心在于紧密结合冬春生产来巩固所有农业社。应该抓住这一主要环节来做好工作。
    劳动党中央委员、中央农村工作部部长陈友翼向会议作了“检查1959年秋季建社运动情况和当前农业合作化任务”的报告。
    据报道，目前越南北方各地正在大力巩固农业合作社。富寿省委已提出了许多有关加强对社员进行社会主义教育，提高干部技术、文化水平的具体措施。南定省委在大抓巩固农业社工作同时，在全省各个农业社中，发动了竞赛运动，以便总结晚造生产经验，搞好冬春生产。有些省、县委为了加强对农业社的巩固工作，已经分别派出干部下乡。
    越南劳动党中央委员会委员、党中央农村工作部部长陈友翼，最近对越南通讯社记者说，我国北方在完成了民族民主革命后，正在沿着社会主义道路前进。在这个阶段里，农业合作化和发展农业生产是一个主要的环节。
    陈友翼说，几年来我们取得了巨大的成绩，并且带来了1958年以来多方面的极其良好的新的变化。这些变化在农村中表现为：改变生产关系，改革生产技术，发展生产。这三个运动紧密地结合在一起而又互相推动着向前发展。
    陈友翼着重指出，农业合作化方面所取得的重大胜利，大大加强了农村社会主义的力量，进一步击退了农村的资本主义自发势力，为1960年合作化运动的发展创造了条件。
    陈友翼说，在合作化运动迅速发展的基础上，技术改革运动也比过去有了很大的进步。许多作物的产量和单位面积产量都得到提高。尤其是稻谷，1958年全年平均产量每公顷达到二千零四十八公斤，1959年早稻平均产量每公顷达到二千零七十公斤，而晚稻平均产量每公顷达到二千五百公斤。全年平均产量每公顷可达二千三百公斤。而在法国殖民者统治时期的1939年，全北方平均产量每公顷只有一千三百公斤。此外，杂粮、经济作物、畜牧、饲养、林业、渔业生产也比过去有了发展。
    他说，如果同南越相比，更可以看出我们农业生产发展的迅速，在1939年南方稻谷总产量为四百一十万吨，北方当时总产量只有二百四十万吨，1958年北方增长到四百五十七万六千吨，南方却下降到了三百九十万吨。今年，北方总产量大约可达到五百二十万吨。
    在谈到农村今后的任务时，陈友翼指出，在合作化运动方面，秋季建社运动结束以后，工作中心应当转到巩固农业社上，还要继续大力巩固和发展变工组，为1960年运动的进一步发展创造条件。在技术改革方面，必须根据已有的经验，积极而适当地推行冬春生产计划提出的全面的增产技术措施。
