The South African African National Congress is scheduled to hold its 47th annual meeting today, which will be of great significance to the South African people's struggle against racial discrimination and for human rights and freedom. Premier Zhou Enlai's telegram of congratulations and support fully expresses the wishes of the Chinese people.

With the vigorous development of the African national independence movement, the struggle of South African Africans against racial discrimination has also reached an unprecedented high this year. Starting with the conflict between Virginia gold mine workers and white colonial officials and military police in early January over colonial exploitation, Africans in various regions have risen up to protest the South African authorities' racial discrimination policies, and the scale of the struggle has grown. On June 18, 40,000 African residents of Durban, many of whom were women, held a large-scale demonstration against racial discrimination and persecution. Although the white military police carried out bloody suppression of the unarmed African people, they failed to stop the development of the African people's struggle. Many regions held demonstrations and protests to support the struggle of Durban women, forming a magnificent climax to the struggle against racial discrimination.

The South African people's struggle against racial discrimination has deep social and historical roots. In 1910, South Africa established a federal government dominated by European white immigrants, becoming a so-called independent country. However, the situation of the more than 9.6 million Africans, who account for two-thirds of South Africa's total population, did not improve in the slightest as a result; on the contrary, they were even more enslaved and persecuted. After World War II, with the rise of the African national independence movement, the South African authorities also stepped up the implementation of racial discrimination policies to suppress the South African Africans' liberation struggle. After the South African National Party came to power in 1948, it successively promulgated more than 70 racial discrimination and oppression laws, the most important of which were the "Apartheid Act," the "Suppression of Communism Act," the "Pass Laws," the "Masters and Servants Act," the "Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act," the "Natives (Urban Areas) Act," and the "Native Labour Regulation Act," etc. In recent years, the South African ruling authorities' racial discrimination policies have become even more intensified and have emerged one after another, and a series of new racial discrimination laws have been promulgated. Although the racial discrimination laws of the South African Federation are numerous in name, they have only one purpose, which is to maintain absolute colonial oppression and colonial exploitation of the African people. For example, the "Pass Laws" stipulate that every African over the age of sixteen must carry 27 types of documents, such as "identity cards," "migration permits," "job search certificates," and "tax receipts," with them at all times and everywhere, otherwise they will be arrested and sentenced to imprisonment or fined. In this way, the South African people are deprived of all freedom of movement. From 1956 to 1957 alone, more than 643,000 Africans were arrested for violating the "Pass Laws" and other minor "crimes." These people have become the reserve army of South African slave labor. According to the South African magazine "Drum," South Africa's "farmers hope to obtain labor without spending a penny, and providing such labor has indeed become the main purpose of the pass system. The implementation of this system has turned the police and government officials into cheap farm labor recruiting teams." According to the so-called "Native Land Act," the South African authorities have condoned white colonists in seizing large tracts of fertile land from Africans and expelling millions of Africans to more than 200 specific "native reserves" across the country with barren land and small areas. Due to the lack of minimum living resources, approximately 60% of Africans have no choice but to sell their labor and work as coolies in white factories and mines. The colonists have thus obtained a steady stream of extremely cheap labor.

Under the cruel rule and enslavement of the South African ruling group, the South African people live a life worse than that of animals. The wages of African workers are generally only one-twentieth of the wages of white workers. African farm laborers have to work for the landlords for 180 days a year for free and are also subjected to whippings, imprisonment, and other abuses. "South Africa" magazine wrote that in white farms, Africans "work in conditions like the Middle Ages," "they are often beaten, and people are often beaten to death." Due to the poverty of the indigenous people, according to materials cited by the South African Federal Ministry of Health, the average life expectancy of Africans is 25-30 years lower than that of whites. According to official materials, 200 to 300 out of every 1,000 newborns in this country die, and only 50% of the remaining ones live to the age of sixteen.

Of course, the South African Africans cannot tolerate such an inhuman living situation, and they have been carrying out heroic struggles for a long time. As early as 1912, they established the African National Congress, and under the leadership of this self-organized organization, they united and struggled. In 1951, the African National Congress and other organizations launched the "Defiance Campaign against Unjust Laws." In June 1955, the South African Federal People's Congress formulated the "Freedom Charter," which put forward the slogan "We want freedom in our lifetime," which embodies the African people's reasonable desire and struggle goal of demanding the abolition of all racial discrimination and oppression laws and demanding national equality and democratic freedom. In 1957, in order to oppose fare increases, 60,000 Africans participated in a three-month-long boycott of buses. They walked 20 miles to and from work every day in South Africa's hottest summer and rainy season, and finally won. On March 16, 1958, more than 5,000 African workers gathered to demand equality in political, economic, and social aspects. In late October of the same year, African women continuously demonstrated against the "Special Identity Card" law. This year's demonstration movement by Africans in Durban Port is a new development in the South African natives' struggle against racial discrimination and for freedom. After that, the number of resistance movements has become more and more frequent, and the momentum has become more and more magnificent. Recently, Africans in the Baal area of South Africa held demonstrations and marches to protest the white government's conspiracy to exile Mrs. Mafeking, a trade union leader in the area, to a remote place 700 miles away from her hometown. African women have shown that they are a very important force in the struggle, and many arrested African women still persist in the struggle in prison. When the British "Scotsman" talked about the reason for the firm struggle of South African women, it could not help but admit that this was because "African women recognize the injustice of the system imposed on them and the humiliation they suffer from this system." "The migrant labor system implemented by the white government has caused more and more men to leave the reserves, forcing the women who are left behind to shoulder greater and greater responsibilities... On the other hand, these women have found that their lives in the city do not enjoy the safety of a family, and they have to protect themselves in a disintegrating and sinful society." The newspaper believes: "One thing is certain, now that women have awakened and taken political action, they cannot be easily stopped."

At present, the South African people's struggle against racial discrimination has become an important part of the entire African people's struggle against colonial rule and for national liberation. The vast number of African people have been encouraged and supported by the South African people's struggle. Therefore, colonialists such as Britain, France, and Portugal hold a deeply hostile attitude towards the South African people and actively support the South African reactionary authorities' bloody suppression policies. The United States, which has huge colonial interests in South Africa, is also the most important accomplice of the South African authorities. Not long ago, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Satterthwaite, revealed the hideous face of US imperialists on the South African issue. He clearly announced that the United States stands on the side of the South African ruling group and adopts a so-called "non-interference" attitude towards bloody racial discrimination and racial oppression.

The South African Africans' just struggle against racial discrimination has won the sympathy and support of freedom-loving people in Africa and around the world. Some enlightened white women in the South African Federation have also protested against the authorities' persecution of indigenous women. They believe that "identity cards will mean misfortune, fear, and suffering for African women and their families." In this country, the 1.36 million mixed-race colored people and more than 400,000 Asians who share a common destiny with Africans are even more united with them in a common struggle. People from all over the world, especially the broad masses of people in Asia and Africa, resolutely oppose the racial oppression of the South African Federation. The 1955 Asian-African Conference believed that "the policies and practices of apartheid and discrimination" are "not only a flagrant violation of human rights, but also a denial of the basic values of civilization and human dignity." International organizations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Democratic Women's Federation, and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council have repeatedly condemned the South African Federal Government's policy of racial discrimination and persecution at home and demanded equal political, economic, and social status for all non-Europeans. Recently, the United Nations General Assembly has again passed a resolution condemning racial discrimination in the South African Federation for the eighth time. People in countries such as Uganda and Tanganyika have recently launched a movement to boycott South African goods. Teachers and students in countries such as Britain and Ghana have protested against the South African Federal Government's implementation of racial discrimination policies against students. All progressive mankind is watching the heroic struggle of South African Africans against racial oppression and racial discrimination with deep sympathy. As Chief Luthuli, President of the South African African National Congress, recently said: "The increasingly accelerated progress of the South African struggle and the advance of the various African peoples indicate that the days of colonialism and oppression are not long."

    南非人民反对种族歧视的斗争
    周修庆
    南非非洲人国民大会定于今天举行第四十七届年会，这对于南非人民反对种族歧视、争取人权和自由的斗争，将具有重大意义。周恩来总理致电表示祝贺和支持，这完全表达了中国人民的意愿。
    随着非洲民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，今年以来南非非洲人反对种族歧视的斗争也有了空前高涨。从1月上旬弗吉尼亚金矿工人因反对殖民剥削和白人官员军警发生冲突开始，各地非洲人民纷起抗议南非当局的种族歧视政策，斗争规模越来越大。6月18日德班港四万非洲居民，其中许多是妇女，为反对种族歧视和迫害举行了大规模的示威。白人军警虽然对手无寸铁的非洲人民进行了血腥的镇压，但是并未能制止非洲人民斗争的发展。许多地区举行了示威抗议，支持德班妇女的斗争，形成了波澜壮阔的反对种族歧视斗争的高潮。
    南非人民反对种族歧视的斗争，是有其深刻的社会历史根源的。1910年，南非建立了以欧洲白种移民占绝对统治地位的联邦政府，成为所谓独立国家。但是，占南非总人口三分之二的九百六十多万非洲人的处境并未因此得到丝毫改善，他们反而更加处于被奴役的和受迫害的地位。第二次世界大战以后，随着非洲民族独立运动的高涨，南非当局也加紧实行种族歧视政策来镇压南非非洲人的解放斗争。1948年，南非国民党上台以后，曾先后颁布了七十余种种族歧视和压迫的法令，重要的有：“种族隔离法”、“镇压共产主义条例”、“通行证法”、“奴役法”、“禁止杂婚法”、“土著迁移法”和“土著民族劳工法”等等。近年以来，南非统治当局的种族歧视政策更是变本加厉、层出不穷，又颁布了一系列新的种族歧视法令。南非联邦的种族歧视法令虽然名目繁多，但它们的目的则只有一个，这就是维持对非洲人民绝对的殖民压迫和殖民剥削。例如“通行证法”就规定每一个年满十六岁的非洲人必须随时随地携带“身份证”、“迁移证”、“寻职证”、“纳税收据”等二十七种证件，否则就要遭到逮捕而被判徒刑或处以罚金。这样，南非人民就被剥夺了一切活动自由。仅在1956年到1957年，由于违犯“通行证法”和其他细小的“罪名”被捕的非洲人就达六十四万三千多人。这些人都成了南非奴隶劳动的后备军。据南非“鼓声”月刊揭露：南非的“农场主希望不花一文地获得劳工，提供这样的劳动力确乎已经成为通行证制度的主要目的。这种制度的实施已经把警察和政府官员变成廉价的农场劳工的强募队”。南非当局根据所谓“土著保留地法案”，纵容白种殖民者抢走了非洲人的大片肥沃土地，将几百万非洲人驱逐到全国特定的二百多个土地贫瘠、面积狭小的“土著保留地”里去。由于缺乏最低限度的生活资料，大约60％的非洲人不得不以出卖劳动力而到白人的工厂和矿场去做苦工。殖民者由此得到了源源不断的极其廉价的劳动力。
    在南非统治集团残酷的统治和奴役下，南非人民过着牛马不如的生活。非洲工人的工资一般只有白种工人工资的二十分之一。非洲雇农每年要给地主白白地工作一百八十天，还要受到鞭笞、监禁和其他虐待。“南非”杂志写道，在白人的农场中，非洲人“在和中世纪一样的条件下工作”，“他们常常被毒打，经常有人被打死。”由于土著居民的贫困，根据南非联邦卫生部所引用的材料，非洲人的寿命平均比白人低二十五—三十岁。根据官方材料，这个国家每一千个新生婴儿中就有二百到三百人死亡，其余能活到十六岁的只有50％。
    对这种惨无人道的生活处境，南非非洲人当然不能忍受下去，他们长期来一直在进行着英勇的斗争。早在1912年，他们就成立了非洲人国民大会，在这个自己组织的领导下团结一致地进行斗争。1951年，非洲人国民大会等团体发动了“蔑视不公正法令运动”。1955年6月南非联邦人民代表大会制订了“自由宪章”，提出了“我们要终生自由”的口号，体现了非洲人要求废除一切种族歧视和压迫的法令、要求取得民族平等和民主自由的权利的合理愿望和斗争目标。1957年，为了反对车费涨价，六万非洲人参加了历时三个月的抵制乘车运动，他们在南非最炎热的夏季也是多雨的季节每天来回步行二十英里路程去上班，最后取得了胜利。1958年3月16日，五千多名非洲工人集会要求在政治、经济、社会各方面地位平等。同年10月下旬，非洲妇女连续示威反对“特别身份证”法。今年德班港非洲人的示威运动，更是南非土著居民反对种族歧视、争取自由斗争的新的发展，在这之后，反抗运动的次数越来越频繁，声势也越来越浩大了。最近，南非巴尔地区的非洲人举行示威游行，抗议白人政府阴谋把该地工会领袖马费肯夫人放逐到离家乡七百英里外的荒凉地方去。非洲妇女在斗争中显示出她们是一支十分重要的力量，有许多被捕的非洲妇女在监狱中仍然坚持着斗争。英国“苏格兰人报”在谈到南非妇女斗争坚决的原因时也不能不承认这是由于“非洲妇女认识到强加于她们的制度的非正义性和这种制度使她们遭受到的屈辱。”“白人政府所实行的移民劳工制度已使越来越多的男人离开保留地，迫使留下来的妇女担负越来越大的责任……。另一方面，这些妇女又发现她们在城市中的生活享受不到一个家庭的安全，她们不得不在一个瓦解的、罪恶社会中保护自己。”这家报纸认为：“有一件事是肯定的，妇女们既然已经觉醒起来采取政治行动，她们是不能轻易加以阻挡的”。
    目前，南非人民反对种族歧视的斗争已经成为全非洲人民反对殖民统治、争取民族解放斗争的重要组成部分。广大非洲人民都从南非人民的斗争中得到鼓舞和支持。因此，英、法、葡萄牙等殖民主义者对南非人民都抱着刻骨的敌视态度，积极支持南非反动当局的血腥镇压政策。在南非有着巨大殖民利益的美国，也是南非当局最重要的帮凶。不久以前，美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿萨脱斯威特便曾在南非问题上露出了美帝国主义者的狰狞面目。他明白宣布，美国站在南非统治集团一边，对血腥的种族歧视和种族压迫采取所谓不“干预”的态度。
    南非非洲人的反对种族歧视的正义斗争，得到了非洲和全世界爱好自由人民的同情和支持。南非联邦的一些开明的白人妇女，也曾抗议当局对土著妇女的迫害。她们认为“身份证对非洲妇女和她们的家庭将意味着不幸、恐惧和苦难”。在这个国家里，同非洲人有着共同命运的一百三十六万混血的有色人和四十多万亚洲人，更是同他们团结在一起共同斗争。世界各国公众，首先是亚非各国的广大人士都坚决反对南非联邦的种族压迫。1955年的亚非会议认为“种族隔离和歧视的政策和实践”，“不仅是对人权的粗暴的侵犯，而且对文明的基本价值和人类尊严的否定”。世界工会是联合会、国际民主妇女联合会、亚非人民团结理事会等国际性组织，也都一再谴责南非联邦政府在国内实行种族歧视和迫害的政策，要求给一切非欧洲人以政治、经济和社会等方面的平等地位。最近，联合国大会又第八次地通过了谴责南非联邦种族歧视的决议。乌干达、坦噶尼喀等国家的人民最近都开展了抵制南非商品的运动。而英国和加纳等国的教师、学生则纷纷抗议南非联邦政府对学生施行种族歧视政策。所有进步的人类都怀着深刻的同情注视南非非洲人反对种族压迫和种族歧视的英勇斗争。正如南非非洲人国民大会主席卢图利最近所说的：“南非斗争的日益加速进行以及非洲各族人民的挺进都表明殖民主义和压迫的日子不长了。”
