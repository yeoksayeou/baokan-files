    Always Maintain Vigor
    Liǔ Dí
    In the mornings in Beijing, young athletes are often seen running long distances on the roads. Whether it's the heat of summer or the cold of winter, they are always steaming with sweat, their faces flushed, gathering all their strength, their lithe steps flying forward, running, running. This scene attracts the attention of some pedestrians. It often happens that during a race, some athletes temporarily fall behind a few steps, but people don't laugh at them. Discerning people comment: "Don't think he's not running in front; he has plenty of drive and stamina!" Sure enough, the long-distance champions are often those athletes who are always full of energy. Their steps are strong and powerful, their momentum increasing, running faster and faster. As they approach the finish line, they sprint and surge ahead.
    Isn't doing a job or handling a matter just like running a long distance? A good revolutionary, like an excellent long-distance runner, always keeps their revolutionary drive increasing, handles things better and better, and constantly unleashes inexhaustible power to push the revolutionary cause from victory to victory. However, there are also situations where, due to insufficient subjective effort or the influence of objective conditions, some comrades temporarily fall behind a few steps, and some work is temporarily not in the forefront. In this case, a true revolutionary never shrinks back, feeling overwhelmed by difficulties, afraid to do this or that, but instead picks up their spirits and catches up. If they lagged behind in the previous stage, they make redoubled efforts to catch up in the next stage. This is how a revolutionary demonstrates their indomitable will and courageous revolutionary perseverance, using this spirit to make up for shortcomings in their work, using this spirit to strive for greater victories, and they will always be able to continuously leap forward. When we do anything, we always hope to do it well from the start and strive to be "upstream." If we don't achieve "upstream" at the beginning, then we continue to work hard and put in extra effort to grab the "upstream." This spirit of catching up is something every revolutionary should possess.
    People who truly possess revolutionary vigor always maintain and develop full vigor from beginning to end in everything they do. The vitality in them never dries up, but becomes more and more vigorous. A careful observation will show how much enormous power the increasingly vigorous revolutionary drive has exerted in our socialist construction. Workers on the industrial front have already made great achievements in completing this year's production plan. They are not satisfied and want to fully seize the last few dozen days to complete and overfulfill the state plan ahead of schedule. A small number of industrial and mining enterprises did not complete their production plan last month, or did not overfulfill it, so this month they worked hard to catch up, and completing it is not enough, they must overfulfill it; overfulfilling it is not enough, they must overfulfill it even more. This is a valuable drive. This year, many regions have suffered severe natural disasters. Some places had reduced spring crops, but people were not discouraged. They used redoubled efforts to overcome the disasters, enabling the late autumn crops to have a bumper harvest and making up for the losses of the spring crops. This is another valuable drive. In competitions, those who temporarily fall behind do not lose heart or belittle themselves. They do not want to be cowards, but warriors, so they chase after them in one breath, finally catching up with the advanced and surpassing the advanced. This is also a valuable drive. Many things are achieved with an increasingly full drive to obtain the final victory. Things that were not done in the past are now done with redoubled efforts; things that were not done well yesterday are done better today with extra effort. Without such an increasingly full drive, nothing can be accomplished. Without such a noble revolutionary perseverance, the revolution cannot be carried through to the end. We have boosted our morale and strived for progress, changing the country's economic landscape. But this is just the beginning; our greater strength is behind us, and greater achievements are also behind us.
    People often say, "The older you get, the younger you become." This is absolutely true. Every revolutionary should have an increasingly vigorous revolutionary will and an increasingly abundant revolutionary drive. Be full of vitality when you are young, and be "vigorous in old age" when you are old. Always maintain and develop revolutionary drive, day after day, decade after decade, the light and heat emitted from the body is inexhaustible. In one's life, one must always become an excellent long-distance runner, a resolute and thorough revolutionary.
    The advanced are in front, and those behind must catch up! Difficulties block the way, we must overcome difficulties and catch up; those in the "middle reaches" must catch up! Those in the "lower reaches" must work harder to catch up. Where does this drive to catch up come from? It comes from lofty revolutionary ideals, from a strong revolutionary will, from unwavering confidence and courage, and also from continuous learning and training, and continuous tapping of potential. Without these, it is naturally impossible to have a vigorous revolutionary drive, let alone continue to develop a revolutionary drive and boost the drive to the fullest. If the initial drive is not used, then use the subsequent drive. The initial and subsequent drives are always twisted into a huge force, pushing us forward with our heads held high.

    永保干劲
    柳笛
    北京的早晨，马路上经常有一些年轻的运动员锻炼长跑。不管是炎夏，还是寒冬，他们总是头上冒着热气，脸上泛着红光，鼓足全身的力气，飞动着矫健的步伐，向前跑着，跑着。这情景，很吸引了一些行人的注意。常有这样的情况：在比赛的时候，有的运动员暂时落后了几步，可是人们并不讥笑他，有眼力的人们议论着：“你别看他没有跑在前面，他的干劲足，有后劲！”果然不错，长跑冠军常常是那些始终干劲十足的运动员，他们的步子雄壮有力，劲头越来越大，越跑越快，接近目的地的时候，一个冲刺，便跑到前面去了。
    我们做一件工作，办一件事情，不是也和长跑一样吗？一个好的革命者就像一个优秀的长跑运动员一样，总是把革命干劲越鼓越足，把事情越办越好，永远发挥着无穷无尽的力量，把革命事业由胜利推向胜利。可是，也有这样的情况：有时由于主观努力不够，或者受客观条件的影响，有的同志暂时落后了几步，有的工作暂时没有身居上游。在这种情况下，一个真正的革命者从来都不畏畏缩缩，觉得困难重重，这也不敢做，那也不敢做，而是振作精神，迎头赶上。前一段拉下了，就在后一段加倍努力赶上去。这才能表现出一个革命者百折不挠的意志和勇往直前的革命毅力，用这种精神去弥补工作中做得不足的地方，用这种精神去争取更大的胜利，就永远能够不断地跃进。我们做任何事情，总希望一开始就把它做好，争得“上游”，如果开始没有争得“上游”呢？那就继续努力，多加一把劲去把“上游”争到手。这种迎头赶上去的劲头，是每一个革命者都应该具备的。
    真正具有革命干劲的人，他们办任何事情都是自始至终永远保持和发扬十足的干劲，他们身上的活力永不枯竭，越来越旺盛。仔细观察一下就可以看见，在我们的社会主义建设事业中，越来越旺盛的革命干劲，发挥了多么巨大的力量。工业战线上的职工在完成今年生产计划中已经做出了很大的成绩，他们不满足，还要全面抓紧最后几十天，提前和超额完成国家计划。有少数的工矿企业，前一个月没有完成生产计划，或者没有超额完成生产计划，这一个月就努力赶上去，完成了不算，还要超额；超额了还不满足，还要超额得更多。这是一种可贵的干劲。今年许多地区遭受特大灾害，有的地方春季作物减产，可是人们并不灰心丧气，他们用加倍的努力战胜灾害，使晚秋作物获得丰收，并且弥补了春季作物的损失，这又是一种可贵的干劲。在竞赛中，暂时落在后面的人，不灰心，不自馁，他们不做懦夫，而要做勇士，于是一鼓作气地追上去，终于赶上先进，超过先进，这也是一种可贵的干劲。许多事情都是凭着越来越足的干劲获得最后胜利的。过去没有做到的事，现在加倍努力去做到；昨天没有做好的事，今天多加一把劲去做好。没有这么一股子越来越足的劲头，什么事情也办不成功，没有这么一种高贵的革命毅力，就不能革命到底。我们鼓足干劲，力争上游，改变了国家的经济面貌。可是，这只不过是个开始，我们更大的力量在后面，更大的成绩也在后面。
    人们常说：“越活越年轻”。这话千真万确。每一个革命者都应该是革命意志越来越旺盛，革命干劲越来越充沛。年轻时朝气蓬勃，年纪大了“老当益壮”。永远保持和发扬革命干劲，几十年如一日，身上发出的光和热是取之不尽，用之不竭的。一个人在一生中，时时刻刻都要成为优秀的长跑健将，成为坚决、彻底的革命者。
    先进者在前，后面的人要迎头赶上！困难拦路，我们要战胜困难，迎头赶上；身居“中游”者要迎头赶上！身居“下游”更要发奋努力迎头赶上。这种迎头赶上的干劲从哪里来？它来自远大的革命理想，来自坚强的革命意志，来自毫不动摇的信心和勇气，也来自不断地学习和锻炼，不断地挖掘潜力。没有这些，自然就不可能有旺盛的革命干劲，更谈不上继续发扬革命干劲，把干劲越鼓越足了。前劲没有用上，就用后劲，前劲后劲永远拧成一股巨大的力量，推动着我们永远昂首挺胸地前进。
