Factory and Mine Workers Praise Stores

    Your service spirit is excellent. We guarantee to do a good job in production to repay your support.
    ——Liu Jiaming, Hunan Xikuangshan Mine Party Branch

    It is very difficult to repair the machines underground. If you hadn't delivered food and drink in time, it wouldn't have been repaired in fifty minutes. It only took five minutes to eat something, and as a result, it was repaired in twenty minutes!
    ——Zhao Jiuyi, Fengfeng Coal Mine Repairman

    The factory and the store are one family, the service attitude is praised by everyone, they care about the workers in every way, and promote production to rise steadily.
    ——Workers of Zhuzhou City

    工厂商店是一家，服务态度人人夸，关心职工样样好，促进生产节节高。
