Xinhua News Agency, December 29th, dispatch from Tokyo by TASS on December 28th: This year has not been easy for ordinary working people in Japan. According to newspaper reports, commodity prices in November this year rose by 5% compared to November last year. Rubber shoes, which are in high demand among Japanese residents, increased in price by 10%-15% in December.

The white paper on residents' material living conditions, published on November 28th, stated that one-eighth of families had formally requested government agencies to improve unbearable living conditions.

According to official sources, approximately ten million people nationwide in 1959 had incomes below the prescribed minimum living expenses. In the Japanese capital, one-seventh of the residents live in a state of semi-starvation.

In 1959, the number of unemployed people increased again. In particular, capitalists in the coal mining areas of Kyushu and Hokkaido laid off workers on a large scale. As a result, the number of unemployed people on Kyushu Island increased by more than 50,000.

What awaits Japanese workers in the coming year? According to official statements, the largest cities in Japan, Tokyo and Osaka, will increase gas fees by an average of 12% starting from New Year's Day. According to officials, this will lead to price increases for certain commodities. Authorities plan to increase electricity fees by 7% and also increase the price of rice, the staple food of residents.

Local councils in Tokyo and other cities are studying the issue of raising rents. They are also preparing to increase Tokyo subway fares by 25% next year.

Xinhua News Agency, December 30th, dispatch from Tokyo: A commentary published by Japan's Kyodo News Agency on the 26th, looking at Japan's economic prospects, expressed concern that the distorted development of the Japanese economy would cause a new crisis.

The commentary said that recently, some dangerous signs sufficient to cause "excessive economic expansion" have begun to appear in Japan's economic trends.

The commentary said that since August, prices in Japan have been gradually rising. From next year, gas fees, transportation fees, and the prices of petroleum products will increase. Entrepreneurs' desire to invest in equipment is becoming increasingly strong. A large increase in equipment investment will cause prices to rise. In the financial sector, the number of Bank of Japan notes issued has increased by 17% compared to the same month last year, reflecting the increased demand for funds. This increase rate greatly exceeds the 1959 economic growth rate. This situation shows that Japan's economy has begun to take on inflationary characteristics. Japan's import volume has recently begun to increase, leading to a tendency for the balance of international payments to deteriorate. Japan's surplus in foreign exchange receipts and payments in November was 34 million U.S. dollars, a decrease of 40 million U.S. dollars compared to the previous month.

　　日本经济状况一年不如一年
    新的一年面临更严重的失业、饥饿和物价上涨
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社东京28日讯：今年这一年对日本的普通劳动人民说来是不轻松的。据报纸报道，今年11月份商品的价格比去年11月份上涨了5％。在日本居民中需求量很大的胶鞋12月份涨价10％—15％。
    11月28日出版的关于居民物质生活条件的白皮书说，八分之一的家庭曾经正式向政府机关请求改善无法忍受的居住条件。
    据官方消息，1959年在全国约有一千万人的收入低于规定的最低生活费。在日本首都，七分之一的居民过着半饥饿的可怜生活。
    在1959年，失业的人数又增多了。特别是九州和北海道煤矿区的资本家大批地解雇了工人。这样，九州岛上的失业人数增加了五万多。
    在将要到来的一年中，什么东西在等着日本劳动者呢？据官方声明说，日本的最大城市——东京和大阪将从元旦起平均提高煤气费12％，据官方说，这将引起某些商品的涨价。当局打算提高电费7％，还要提高居民的主食品——米的价格。
    东京和其他城市的地方议会都在研究提高房租的问题。而且还准备在明年提高东京地下电车费25％。
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本共同社26日发表的一篇展望日本经济前景的评论，担心日本经济的畸形发展将引起新的危机。
    评论说，最近在日本的经济动向方面已经开始出现一些足以引起“经济过分膨胀”的危险征兆。
    评论说，自从8月以来，日本的物价就在逐渐上涨。从明年起，煤气费、交通运输费、石油制品的价格等将要提高。企业家进行设备投资的愿望越来越强烈。设备投资的大量增加将会使物价上涨。在金融方面，日本银行券的发行数额比上一年同月的水平增加了17％，这反映出资金需求量增加的情况。这个发行数额的增加率大大超过了1959年度经济增长率。这个情况显示日本的经济已经开始带上了通货膨胀的色彩。日本的进口数额最近已经开始增加，以致国际收支开始出现恶化的倾向。日本11月份在外汇收支方面盈余三千四百万美元，盈余数额比上一月减少了四千万美元。
