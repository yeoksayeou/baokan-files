To uphold putting politics in command and to criticize and overcome right-leaning opportunist thought are the main tasks on our country's ideological and political fronts at present, and are the main ideological and political conditions for ensuring the continued great leap forward of our country's socialist construction.

**Politics in Command Means Party Leadership**

Putting politics in command means implementing proletarian political leadership, i.e., the leadership of the Communist Party, over the cause of socialist construction.

The Party's policy of "putting politics in command" is a firm Marxist-Leninist policy. However, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists within the Party oppose the Party's putting politics in command and oppose the Party's leadership over the cause of socialist construction. Their opposition to the Party's leadership over the cause of socialist construction is extremely absurd, both theoretically and practically.

Marxist-Leninist theory and historical facts from around the world tell us that all socialist revolutions, like any revolution in history, must be based on certain objective laws of economic development (the law that the relations of production must conform to the nature of the productive forces) and laws of political development (the laws of class struggle and revolution). However, socialist revolution differs fundamentally from any revolution in history. Revolutions in history have only replaced one new system of exploitation with an old one, and the foundation of these systems has been built upon the private ownership of the means of production. Precisely because of this, at the time, new social and economic forms were always formed spontaneously within the old society on the basis of private ownership (for example, the economic forms of capitalism spontaneously formed within feudal society). Therefore, the task of the revolution was limited to establishing a ruling position for the new economic forms that had already formed spontaneously, and was limited to promoting the smooth development of the new economic forms by destroying the old political and legal superstructure and eliminating the old economic forms. Therefore, this kind of revolution always ends with the establishment of the political rule of a new exploiting class. Not only that, but the transformation of this political superstructure is limited to the change of rulers and does not change the old anti-people state machine itself. In contrast, socialist economic forms cannot be formed spontaneously on the basis of private ownership of the means of production, that is to say, they cannot be formed spontaneously within capitalist society. Therefore, the socialist revolution has a particularly important task, which is to establish new socialist economic forms. Precisely because of this, the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship is not the end of the socialist revolution, but only the beginning of the socialist revolution, only "the first step in the workers' revolution" ("The Communist Manifesto"). The socialist revolution is the most profound and extensive revolution in human history. It must thoroughly transform all class exploitation systems inherited from the past and all private ownership systems of the means of production that inevitably produce exploitation. It must thoroughly transform all superstructures built upon class exploitation systems and private ownership systems, including the social, political, and ideological superstructures. In this way, socialist revolution and socialist construction will go through the following stages or key points of development: creating a complete proletarian worldview—the scientific Marxist-Leninist proletarian revolutionary theory; establishing a proletarian vanguard Communist Party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory; the Communist Party leading the proletariat and the working people to carry out violent revolution to seize power, completely smashing the old anti-people state machine of the landlord and bourgeois classes, and establishing the proletarian dictatorship led by the Communist Party; then, under the protection of this new political superstructure of the proletarian dictatorship, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, carrying out a revolution to change the ownership of the means of production, economically eliminating the exploiting classes, and transforming the petty-private owner class, thereby gradually developing to the elimination of all class distinctions; carrying out socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, continuing to complete the transformation of the political relations of various classes, that is, the transformation of the political superstructure (including the thorough transformation of political and legal institutions and the transformation of political parties and organizations), and completing the fundamental transformation of people's thoughts, feelings, habits, traditions, and worldviews; transforming all social relations according to socialist principles, including national relations, family relations, and social lifestyles; developing the productive forces at high speed according to the basic economic laws of socialism and the laws of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, and vigorously improving the material and cultural lives of the people, and so on. Overall, the socialist revolution is to clear the way for socialist and communist construction, and after the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship, socialist revolution and socialist construction on all fronts are carried out in an interlocking manner. Socialist revolution and socialist construction are a process of continuous revolution and construction on all fronts, which includes the entire era of transition from capitalist society to communist society. In Marx's words, this is an "era of revolutionary transformation." From this, it can be seen that the socialist economy is fundamentally created consciously by the proletarian vanguard Communist Party and the socialist state led by the proletariat, according to objective economic and political laws, leading the proletariat and the working people, and can never be formed spontaneously. In such a situation, how can the cause of socialist construction be without proletarian politics in command, and how can it be without the leadership of the Communist Party?

**On the Relationship Between Politics and Economics**

One of the "reasons" why right-leaning opportunists oppose the leadership of the Party and putting politics in command is that the Party attaches too much importance to the role of politics and not enough to the role of the economy and material things. This argument of the right-leaning opportunists is a complete reprint of the anti-Marxist fallacies spread by Trotsky, Bukharin and others after the Russian October Revolution. In his article "On the Trade Unions, the Present Situation and Trotsky's Mistakes," written in December 1920, Lenin criticized Trotsky for looking at the role of trade unions apart from politics, pointing out that this attitude "is not Marxist," because in Marxism, "politics is the most concentrated expression of economics." In his article "More on the Trade Unions, the Present Situation and the Mistakes of Trotsky and Bukharin," Lenin, referring to the fact that these two people said that Lenin was looking at the problem "from a political point of view" and they were looking at the problem "from an economic point of view," further pointed out: "There is an amazing theoretical error here. In my speech, I have repeatedly said that politics is the concentrated expression of economics... Politics cannot but take precedence over economics. Not to affirm this is to forget the most basic common sense of Marxism." Lenin went on to say: "If it is said (or if this idea is only indirectly expressed) that looking at the problem from a political point of view and looking at the problem 'from an economic point of view' have the same value, and 'both' can be adopted, this is to forget the most basic common sense of Marxism... This is a theoretical degeneration to an eclectic position... The whole problem lies in (from the Marxist point of view, and can only lie in): a class cannot maintain its rule if it does not deal with problems correctly from a political point of view, and therefore cannot solve its production tasks." Does not Lenin's meaning here clearly say that we should implement proletarian politics in command for the cause of socialist construction?

Politics arises directly from people's economic relations, that is, the relations of production, and from the social relations (class relations) determined by the relations of production. Politics is the superstructure built on a certain economic foundation. It is used to protect the economic foundation and serve the economic foundation, and it has a significant role in promoting or hindering the development of social productive forces. The politics of the proletariat is a series of tenacious struggles carried out by the proletariat and the revolutionary people in order to establish and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, to transform the entire social life with the principles of socialism and communism, and to establish the socialist system and develop socialist and communist construction. The politics of the proletariat is the means by which the proletariat and the revolutionary people correctly handle various relations between people, correctly handle contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, and is used to transform the objective world and transform their own subjective world, to unite ourselves and unite all forces that can be united, to defeat the enemies of socialism and build socialism and communism. In a word, the politics of the proletariat is the conscious struggle carried out by the proletariat and the working people under the leadership of the proletarian vanguard Communist Party in order to establish a socialist and communist system. This conscious struggle has a decisive role in achieving the victory of the socialist revolution and building socialism and communism; because, as mentioned earlier, the socialist economy is fundamentally created consciously and actively by the Communist Party leading the proletariat and the revolutionary people; and the politics of the proletariat clears all obstacles on the road to the development of the socialist economy. In this way, politics cannot but take precedence over economics.

Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the practice of socialist construction in our country, brilliantly elaborated the principle of "politics is the most concentrated expression of economics" that Lenin said, and he particularly emphasized that all economic work must rely on the Party's strong political and ideological work to ensure, that is, to implement politics in command. He said: "Political work is the lifeblood of all economic work, especially in a period when fundamental changes are taking place in the social and economic system."

Political work is so important because in any historical period, there will always be contradictory ideological struggles between the advanced and the backward, the innovative and the conservative, and the active and the passive among the people, and in the transition period, the struggle is mainly between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. If the proletariat's ideology does not occupy the position in people's minds, the bourgeoisie's ideology will definitely occupy it. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's thinking, as far as the present is concerned, although the social and economic system has changed, the bourgeois ideology and upper-petty-bourgeois ideology left over from the old era and remaining in the minds of a considerable number of people cannot be overcome quickly. To overcome this requires a considerable amount of time, and it requires our Party to carry out strong ideological and political work. As early as the end of 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his note to the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside": "The agricultural cooperation movement, from the very beginning, was a serious ideological and political struggle. Every cooperative cannot be established without such a struggle... After the cooperative is established, it must go through many struggles to consolidate itself. After it is consolidated, it may collapse again as soon as it slackens... Opposing the spontaneous tendency of selfish and self-interested capitalism and advocating the socialist spirit of taking the principle of combining collective interests and personal interests as the standard of all words and deeds is the ideological and political guarantee for the gradual transition of the scattered small-scale peasant economy to a large-scale cooperative economy." He also said: "Cooperatives must emphasize doing a good job in political work. The basic task of political work is to continuously instill socialist ideas into peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies." These instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong are, of course, still fully applicable to rural work after the realization of the people's communes.

Comrade Mao Zedong's saying in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that "without a correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul" applies to everyone participating in socialist construction. In order to accelerate socialist construction, our Party must not only strengthen the socialist ideological education of the peasant masses, but also strengthen the ideological education of workers, young students, intellectuals, and industrialists and businessmen. Of course, generally speaking, the specific requirements for ideological work among people of different classes are different. For bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, the requirement is that they fundamentally change their class stand and worldview, while for the working class and the working masses, the general requirement is to overcome the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie; however, the fact that people of all classes need to be transformed and need to establish or improve their communist worldview is the same. That is to say, it is inseparable from putting politics in command. Even within the Communist Party, it is necessary to constantly carry out ideological work and constantly carry out necessary ideological struggles, because the class struggle in society and the struggle between the two roads in the transition period will inevitably be reflected in the Party. The current struggle against right-leaning opportunist elements is a sharp manifestation of the struggle between the two roads within the Party.

From the above, it can be seen that the right-leaning opportunists' attack on the Party's emphasis on the role of politics and not on the role of economics only exposes their refusal to recognize the most basic truth of Marxism-Leninism about the relationship between politics and economics. Because the right-leaning opportunists are plagued by their bourgeois ideology, and because they not only refuse to disarm their bourgeois worldview, but also vainly attempt to use their bourgeois worldview to transform the Party and transform Chinese society, they are most afraid of and hate the Party's strong ideological and political work.

**On the Relationship Between Subjective Initiative and Objective Economic Laws**

When attacking the Party's policy of putting politics in command and the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," the right-leaning opportunists also attempt to set the subjective against the objective and the Party's leadership and the subjective efforts of the people under the Party's leadership against objective economic laws. They insist that the Party attaches too much importance to the role of the subjective initiative of the masses and not enough to the role of objective economic laws. This statement is also extremely absurd. The Party's leadership and the subjective efforts made by the masses under the Party's leadership are based on objective economic laws and proceed from objective practical possibilities, and are not opposed to objective economic laws and objective practical situations. From the Marxist-Leninist point of view, people cannot create or eliminate objective laws based on subjective wishes, that is to say, objective laws cannot be violated. But at the same time, Marxism-Leninism also recognizes and attaches great importance to the subjective initiative of the revolutionary masses, and recognizes and attaches great importance to the creative spirit and initiative of the revolutionary masses in creating history. This is because, first, although objective laws cannot be violated, advanced people can and should consciously master and apply them to achieve their goals. Second, unlike the laws of development in nature, social laws must take effect through the active and conscious struggle of advanced social forces to overcome reactionary social forces. Similarly, the basic economic laws of socialism and the laws of planned and proportionate development must take effect through the conscious and active efforts of the proletariat and the working people under the leadership of the Communist Party. Third, the struggle of the proletariat and the revolutionary people in transforming the objective world must proceed from the objective practical situation and must plan their activities within the scope permitted by objective conditions; however, within this scope, the conscious and active efforts made by the proletariat and the revolutionary people under the leadership of the Communist Party have a decisive role in the victory or failure of the struggle, and in the early or late, fast or slow achievement of the socialist revolution and the cause of socialist construction. Fourth, from the Marxist-Leninist point of view, and all historical facts have also proved that human history is ultimately created by the people. The people are not only the bearers and promoters of social productive forces, not only the creators of all social material and cultural wealth, but also the realizers of the transformation of the social mode of production, that is, the social economic system. However, before the proletariat armed with Marxist-Leninist theory appeared as a conscious class, the people could not consciously realize their role in creating and promoting history, but could only unconsciously create history and promote social development, so they could not but be dominated by the laws of social development and become slaves of objective laws, so they were always deceived and dominated by the exploiting classes and ruling classes of all ages and became their slaves. After the proletariat armed with Marxism-Leninism appeared as a conscious class, this situation fundamentally changed. At this time, the proletariat and the broad masses of the people have consciously realized their role as creators of history, have mastered the objective laws of social development under the leadership of the Communist Party, and are using them to achieve their goals. In this way, the people have changed from slaves of objective social development laws to masters who can control and use objective laws to transform the world. In this way, the creative power of the people has been expanded many times; the role of the subjective initiative of the people in transforming society and promoting the development of social productive forces has been expanded many times more than in any period in history.

It is precisely in the era when the proletariat and the revolutionary people are completely consciously creating their own history, it is precisely in the era when the proletariat and the revolutionary people are consciously striving to build a conscious social production organization of planned production and planned distribution, it is precisely in the era when the creative power of the people has been unprecedentedly expanded, and their subjective initiative in creating history has been unprecedentedly increased, that the right-leaning opportunists have vigorously attacked the role of the people's consciousness, that is, the role of subjective initiative, and praised the blind spontaneous action of the laws of social development. May I ask, is this not a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism? Is this not in reality a complete betrayal of the proletariat's socialist cause?

Our country's general line for socialist construction is precisely the product of the unity of objective laws and subjective initiative, and the combination of Marxism-Leninism and our country's specific realities. Seriously implementing the general line can greatly accelerate our country's construction cause; and the practice of the past year or so has also proved this. From the perspective of objective conditions, first, because our country has experienced the most thorough democratic revolution and socialist revolution, our country's social productive forces have been completely liberated, especially our country's most powerful productive force, that is, more than 600 million people, has been completely liberated. This is the most important condition for developing our country's socialist construction cause at high speed. Second, our country also has the mutual support of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and we also have the rich construction experience of the Soviet Union for more than 40 years for us to learn from, so that we can avoid taking many detours. All these situations show that the development of our country's construction cause may be faster. In terms of subjective conditions, the development of our country's construction cause may be faster because our Party's leadership is correct, and the Party's general line for socialist construction is correct. The reason why our Party's leadership and the Party's general line are correct is that it is the most scientific, proceeds from the possible conditions of objective reality, follows the laws of development of objective economic life and political life, and it is also the most revolutionary, fully recognizing and relying on the enormous creative power of more than 600 million people; in that it excellently combines cool scientific analysis with the resolute revolutionary spirit of relying on the masses. The essence of the Party's general line is the due high regard for the awareness, enthusiasm, and creativity of more than 600 million people in building the socialist cause. The "basic point" of the general line adopted by the Eighth National Congress of the Party requires us to use the method of correctly handling contradictions among the people to mobilize all positive factors to the socialist construction front; to use several methods of simultaneous development (this is the concretization of the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy under the conditions of our country) to open up the broadest position, so that the construction team of the broadest masses of the people can be deployed, so that their strength can be most fully used in the socialist construction cause, thereby ensuring the realization of the requirements of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The Party's general line for socialist construction, which gradually formed from 1956 to 1958, has been fully proven to be completely correct in the practice of the past four years. However, the right-leaning opportunists attacked the Party's leadership, attacked the Party's general line of combining objective laws with the creativity of the people, that is, combining the Party's leadership with the broadest mass movement, and they also described the infinitely bright current political and economic situation as a pitch black, which made them reach the point of reversing right and wrong and confusing black and white, so that they fell into the quagmire of subjectivism that was completely divorced from reality and from the masses, and in reality completely stood on the bourgeois anti-socialist position.

**The First Secretary Taking Command is the Organizational Guarantee for Strengthening Party Leadership**

To strengthen the Party's leadership over the cause of socialist construction and implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, we must use the Party's strong organizational work to guarantee it. It is precisely because of this that after the basic victory of the socialist revolution, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong timely pointed out that the entire Party, first of all the Party committees at all levels, must put the main energy into the construction cause, and must seriously grasp it and practically grasp it. The so-called seriously grasping it and practically grasping it is to grasp it accurately and grasp it tightly. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the first secretary of the Party committees at all levels should directly grasp the construction work, that is, the first secretary should directly take command. The first secretary taking command to lead the construction work is the concretization of putting politics in command for the construction cause in terms of organizational leadership. It is precisely because the first secretaries of the Party committees at all levels directly took command, effectively strengthening the leadership of the Party committees at all levels over the construction cause, and closely combining the Party's strong leadership with the broad mass movement, that the overall great leap forward of the construction cause in 1958 and the people's communization of the rural areas throughout the country were realized, and the continued leap forward of the construction cause in 1959 was further realized, and the people's communes were put on the road of consolidation and sound development.

The system of responsibility of the first secretary of the Party committee, as well as the direct command of the first secretary of the Party committee over certain most important tasks, is not only not contradictory to the system of collective leadership of the Party committee, to the broad democracy within the Party, and to the Party's leadership following the mass line, but is precisely the guarantee for realizing the collective leadership of the Party committee, promoting democracy within the Party, and implementing the mass line. We implement democratic centralism in the political life of the country and within the Party. This means that the various suggestions and criticisms freely put forward by the broad masses inside and outside the Party, as well as the advanced experiences they have created, must be concentrated by the Party committees of the leading organs at all levels; and in addition to the Party committee members being responsible for various aspects of work, the first secretary must also be responsible for the overall responsibility, and he must concentrate the collective wisdom of the Party committee, concentrate the opinions and experiences of the masses, and lead the work of the Party committee. Here, democracy and centralism, the Party's leadership and the mass line, the collective leadership of the Party committee and the command of the first secretary, are interdependent, mutually restrictive, and complementary to each other. Without centralism, there can be no democracy; without the Party's leadership, there is no mass line; without the first secretary being responsible for the overall responsibility, a Party committee is scattered and cannot exert the role of collective leadership. However, the right-leaning opportunist elements deliberately "forgot" these most basic truths of Marxism-Leninism, and they opposed the command of the first secretary, insisting that this was "undemocratic" and "dictatorial." In fact, they only wanted to overthrow the Party's proletarian leadership that followed the mass line and implemented democratic centralism, and let themselves usurp the Party's leadership and implement their own anti-Party bourgeois dictatorship.

From the above, it can be seen that the debate between our Party and a small handful of right-leaning opportunist elements on whether or not to put proletarian politics in command, that is, whether or not to have the Party's leadership, is actually a major debate on whether or not to have socialism, and is a serious ideological struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Our Party advocates adhering to putting proletarian politics in command, which is actually adhering to the socialist system, adhering to the correct road of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and adhering to the great leap forward movement and the people's commune movement that eradicate the possibility of capitalist restoration. The right-leaning opportunist elements oppose putting proletarian politics in command, which is actually not wanting the socialist system, but attempting to restore the capitalist system, and is actually advocating putting bourgeois politics in command, that is, letting themselves usurp the Party and "take command" in order to use their bourgeois worldview to transform the Party and transform Chinese society. The evil attempts of the right-leaning opportunist elements have been shattered. We seriously study and publicize the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, adhere to the glorious banner of the Party's general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes, adhere to the Party's policy of putting politics in command and the working methods of the mass line, and thoroughly criticize and overcome the erroneous ideas of right-leaning opportunism, which will undoubtedly greatly improve the socialist and communist awareness of our broad cadres and masses, thereby further greatly promoting our cause of socialist construction. Facts have proved that our Party's leadership is correct, and the Party's policy of putting politics in command is correct. Let us, the entire Party and the people of the whole country, continue to advance bravely under the leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong!

    论政治挂帅
    廖盖隆
    坚持政治挂帅，批判和克服右倾机会主义思想，这是当前我国思想战线上和政治战线上的主要任务，是保证我国社会主义建设事业继续跃进的主要的思想条件和政治条件。
    政治挂帅就是党的领导
    政治挂帅就是对于社会主义建设事业实行无产阶级的政治领导，即共产党的领导。
    党的“政治挂帅”的方针，是坚定的马克思列宁主义的方针。但是党内一小撮右倾机会主义分子却反对党的政治挂帅，反对党对于社会主义建设事业的领导。他们反对党对社会主义建设事业的领导，无论在理论上和实践上，都是异常荒谬的。
    马克思列宁主义理论和全世界的历史事实告诉我们，社会主义革命同历史上任何革命，都必须依据一定的客观的经济生活的发展规律（生产关系要适合于生产力的性质的规律）以及政治生活的发展规律（阶级斗争和革命的规律）；但是社会主义革命同历史上的任何革命比较又有根本的区别。历史上的革命都不过是用一种新的剥削制度来代替旧的剥削制度，这种制度的基础都是建立在生产资料私有制上面；正因为这样，在当时，新的社会经济形式总是在私有制度的基础上、在旧社会内部自发地形成的（例如资本主义的经济形式在封建社会内部就自发地形成了）。因此，革命的任务只限于为已经自发形成的新的经济形式确立统治的地位，只限于用破坏旧的政治法律上层建筑和消灭旧的经济形式的办法来促进新的经济形式的顺利发展。因此，这种革命总是以建立新的剥削阶级的政治统治而宣告结束。不仅如此，这种政治上层建筑的变革，也只是限于统治者的改变，而并不改变旧的反人民的国家机器本身。与此相反，社会主义的经济形式却是不可能在生产资料私有制的基础上自发地形成的，也就是说，它是不可能在资本主义社会内自发地形成的。因此，社会主义革命有一个特殊重大的任务，就是要建立新的社会主义的经济形式。正因为这样，无产阶级专政的政权的建立，不是社会主义革命的结束，而只是社会主义革命的开始，只是“工人革命的第一步”（“共产党宣言”）。社会主义革命是人类历史上最深刻、最广泛的革命，它必须彻底变革过去存留下来的一切阶级剥削制度和必然产生剥削的一切生产资料的私有制度，必须彻底变革过去存留下来的一切建立在阶级剥削制度和私有制度之上的上层建筑，包括社会的、政治的和思想的上层建筑在内。这样，社会主义革命和社会主义建设，就要经历以下的发展阶段或者关键，这就是创立完整的无产阶级的世界观——科学的马克思列宁主义的无产阶级革命理论；建立以马克思列宁主义理论为武装的无产阶级先锋队共产党；共产党领导无产阶级和劳动人民进行夺取政权的暴力革命，彻底打碎旧的地主资产阶级的反人民的国家机器，建立共产党领导的无产阶级专政；之后在无产阶级专政这种新的政治上层建筑的保护下，在共产党的领导下，进行改变生产资料所有制的革命，在经济上消灭剥削阶级，改造小私有者阶级，由此逐步地发展到消灭一切阶级的区分；进行政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，继续完成各阶级的政治关系即政治上层建筑的变革（包括政治法律机构的彻底改造和政治党派、团体的改造），完成人们的思想、感情、习惯、传统和世界观的根本变革；按照社会主义原则来改造人们的一切社会关系，包括民族关系、家庭关系和社会生活方式等等；按照社会主义的基本经济规律和国民经济有计划、按比例发展的规律，高速度地发展生产力，大力提高人民的物质和精神生活，等等。整个说来，社会主义革命是为社会主义和共产主义建设扫清道路的，而在无产阶级专政建立以后，各个战线上的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，是互相交错着进行的。社会主义革命和社会主义建设是各个战线上不断革命和建设的过程，它包括了从资本主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的整个时代，用马克思的话来说，这是一个“革命转变时代”。由此看来，社会主义经济，在根本上就是由无产阶级先锋队共产党和无产阶级领导的社会主义国家，根据客观的经济规律和政治规律，领导无产阶级和劳动人民自觉地创立起来的，而决不可能是自发地形成的。在这样的情况下，试问社会主义建设事业怎么能够没有无产阶级的政治挂帅怎么能够没有共产党的领导呢？
    关于政治和经济的关系
    右倾机会主义者反对党的领导和政治挂帅的一个“理由”是：党太重视政治作用，而太不重视经济物质的作用了。右倾机会主义者的这种论点，完全是俄国十月革命后托洛茨基和布哈林等人所散布的那种反马克思主义谬论的再版。列宁在1920年12月所作“论工会、目前局势及托洛茨基的错误”一文中批驳托洛茨基离开政治来看工会的作用时指出：这种态度“不是马克思主义的”，因为在马克思主义看来，“政治是经济的最集中的表现”。列宁在“再论工会、目前局势及托洛茨基和布哈林的错误”一文中，谈到这两个人说列宁是“从政治上”看问题，而他们是“从经济上”看问题的时候，进一步地指出：“这里存在着惊人的理论错误。我在自己的发言里曾经重复说过，政治是经济的集中表现，……政治同经济相比不能不占首位。不肯定这一点，就是忘记了马克思主义的最起码的常识。”列宁又说：“如果说（或者只是间接地表达了这种思想）从政治上看问题和‘从经济上’看问题有同等的值价，‘二者’都可以采用，这就是忘记了马克思主义的最起码的常识。……这样就在理论上堕落到折衷主义立场上去了。……全部问题在于（从马克思主义的观点来看，也只能在于）：一个阶级如果不从政治上正确地处理问题，就不能维持它的统治，因而也就不能解决它的生产任务。”难道列宁这段话的意思不明明是说，应当对于社会主义的建设事业实行无产阶级的政治挂帅吗？
    政治是从人们的经济关系即生产关系，以及从被生产关系所决定的社会关系（阶级关系）中直接产生出来的。政治是建立在一定的经济基础之上的上层建筑，它是用来保护经济基础和为经济基础服务的，它具有促进或者阻碍社会生产力发展的重大作用。无产阶级的政治，就是无产阶级和革命人民，为着建立和巩固无产阶级专政，为着用社会主义和共产主义的原则来改造整个社会生活，为着确立社会主义制度和发展社会主义、共产主义建设而进行的一系列的顽强的斗争。无产阶级的政治，就是无产阶级和革命人民用来正确地处理人与人之间的各种关系，正确地处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的手段，就是用来改造客观世界和改造自己的主观世界、用来团结自己和团结一切可能团结的力量、战胜社会主义事业的敌人和建设社会主义、共产主义的手段。一句话，无产阶级的政治，就是无产阶级和劳动人民在无产阶级先锋队共产党的领导下为了建立社会主义和共产主义制度而进行的自觉的斗争。这种自觉的斗争，对于取得社会主义革命的胜利和建成社会主义和共产主义，具有决定的作用；因为如同前面所说，社会主义经济，根本上就是共产党领导无产阶级和革命人民自觉地主动地创立起来的；而无产阶级的政治，则为社会主义经济的发展扫清了前进道路上的一切障碍。这样，政治同经济相比，就不能不占首位了。
    毛泽东同志根据我国社会主义建设的实践，卓越地阐发了列宁所说的“政治是经济的最集中的表现”的原理，他特别强调一切经济工作，都要依靠党的坚强的政治思想工作来保证，也就是实行政治挂帅。他说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线，在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”
    政治工作所以这样重要，是因为在任何历史时期，在人民群众中总是会有先进和落后、革新和守旧、积极和消极这类矛盾的思想斗争的，而在过渡时期，则主要是社会主义道路和资本主义道路、无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的斗争。人们头脑中的阵地，如果无产阶级的思想不去占领，资产阶级的思想就一定会去占领。按照毛泽东同志的思想，就现在说，社会经济制度虽然变了，旧时代遗留下来的残存于相当大的一部分人们头脑里的资产阶级思想和上层小资产阶级思想，是不可能很快克服的。要克服，就需要相当长的时间，而且需要我们党进行坚强的思想政治工作。早在1955年底，毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书的按语中就说：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。每一个合作社，不经过这样的一场斗争，就不能创立。……合作社建立以后，还必须经过许多的斗争，才能使自己巩固起来。巩固了以后，只要一松劲，又可能垮台。……反对自私自利的资本主义的自发倾向，提倡以集体利益和个人利益相结合的原则为一切言论行动的标准的社会主义精神，是使分散的小农经济逐步地过渡到大规模合作化经济的思想的和政治的保证。”他又说：“合作社必须强调做好政治工作。政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向。”毛泽东同志的这些指示，对于实现人民公社化以后的农村工作，当然还是完全适用的。
    毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中所说的“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”适用于参加社会主义建设的每一个人。为了加快社会主义建设，我们党不但必须加强对于农民群众的社会主义的思想教育工作，而且必须加强对于工人、青年学生、知识分子和工商业者的思想教育工作。当然，一般说来，对于不同阶级的人们进行思想工作的具体要求是不同的，对于资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，是要求他们根本改变阶级立场和世界观的问题，而对于工人阶级和劳动群众，则一般是克服资产阶级的思想影响的问题；但是，各阶级的人们都需要改造、都需要建立或者健全共产主义世界观这一点，则又是相同的。也就是说都离不开政治挂帅。就是在共产党内部，也必须不断地进行思想工作，不断地开展必要的思想斗争，因为社会上的阶级斗争，过渡时期两条道路的斗争，是必然要反映到党内来的。目前反对右倾机会主义分子的斗争，就是两条道路斗争在党内的尖锐表现。
    从上面说的看来，右倾机会主义者攻击党重视政治作用而不重视经济作用，只不过是暴露了他们拒绝承认马克思列宁主义关于政治和经济的关系的最起码的真理，右倾机会主义者由于他们满脑袋的资产阶级思想作怪，由于他们不但不肯解除自己的资产阶级世界观的武装，反而妄图用他们的资产阶级世界观来改造党和改造中国社会，他们也就最害怕和仇视党的坚强的思想政治工作。
    关于主观能动性和客观经济规律的关系
    右倾机会主义者在攻击党的政治挂帅的方针和党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的时候，还企图把主观同客观对立起来，把党的领导和人民群众在党的领导下进行的主观努力，同客观的经济规律对立起来。他们硬说，党太重视人民群众的主观能动的作用，而太不重视客观经济规律的作用了。这种说法，同样是极端荒谬的。党的领导和人民群众在党的领导下所进行的主观努力，正是以客观的经济规律为依据、从客观的实际可能性出发，而并不是同客观的经济规律和客观实际情况相对立的。从马克思列宁主义的观点看来，人们不能凭着主观的愿望去创立或者摒除客观规律，就是说，客观规律是不能违反的。但是与此同时，马克思列宁主义又承认而且极为重视革命群众的主观能动作用，承认而且极为重视革命群众创造历史的首创精神和主动性。这是因为，第一，客观的规律虽然是不能违反的，但是先进的人们却可以而且应当自觉地掌握和运用它们，来达到自己的目的。第二，与自然界的发展规律不同，社会规律要发生作用，必须经过先进的社会力量战胜反动的社会力量的主动的自觉的斗争。同样地，社会主义的基本经济规律和有计划、按比例的发展规律要发生作用，必须经过无产阶级和革命人民在共产党的领导下所进行的自觉的积极的努力。第三，无产阶级和革命人民改造客观世界的斗争，必须从客观的实际情况出发，必须在客观条件许可的范围内去计划自己的活动；但是，在这个范围内，无产阶级和革命人民在共产党的领导下所进行的自觉的主动的努力，对于斗争的胜利或者失败，对于取得社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业胜利的或迟或早、或慢或快，却具有决定的作用。第四，从马克思列宁主义的观点看来，而且全部历史事实也证明了：人类历史归根结底是人民群众所创造的。人民群众不仅是社会生产力的承担者和推进者，不仅是一切社会的物质和文化财富的创造者，并且是社会生产方式即社会经济制度的变革的实现者。但是，在以马克思列宁主义理论为武装的无产阶级作为自觉的阶级出现以前，人民群众还不可能自觉到自己的创造和推进历史的作用，而只能是不自觉地在创造历史和推动社会向前发展，因而他们就不能不为社会发展规律所支配而成为客观规律的奴隶，因此他们也就总是被历来的剥削阶级、统治阶级所欺骗所支配而成为他们的奴隶。当以马克思列宁主义为武装的无产阶级作为自觉的阶级出现以后，这种情况就根本改变了。在这种时候，无产阶级和广大的人民群众已经自觉到自己作为历史创造者的作用，已经在共产党的领导下掌握了客观的社会发展规律，并且运用它们来达到自己的目的。这样，人民群众就从客观的社会发展规律的奴隶，变为能支配和运用客观规律来改造世界的主人。这样，人民群众就使自己的创造力量扩大到不知多少倍；人民群众的主观能动性对于改造社会和推动社会生产力的发展的作用，比之历史上任何时期，就不知道要扩大多少倍。
    正是在无产阶级和革命人民完全自觉地自己创造自己的历史的时代，正是在无产阶级和革命人民自觉地奋力建设按计划生产和按计划分配的自觉的社会生产组织的时代，正是在人民群众的创造力量空前扩大，而他们创造历史的主观能动作用空前增长的时代，右倾机会主义者却大肆攻击起人民群众自觉性的作用即主观能动作用，而颂扬起社会发展规律的盲目的自发作用来了。试问，这不是完全背叛马克思列宁主义吗？这不是在实际上完全背叛无产阶级的社会主义事业吗？
    我国的社会主义建设总路线，正是客观规律和主观能动性相统一，马克思列宁主义和我国具体实际相结合的产物，认真贯彻执行总路线，就能使我国的建设事业大大加快；而一年多来的实践，也已证明了这一点。从客观条件方面来看，第一，由于我国经历了最彻底的民主革命和社会主义革命，我国的社会生产力已经获得了彻底的解放，特别是我国最强大的生产力，即六亿多人民，获得了彻底的解放，这是高速度地发展我国社会主义建设事业的最重要的条件。第二，我国又有苏联和其他社会主义国家的互相支援，又有苏联四十多年的丰富的建设经验可供我们学习，使我们能够避免走许多弯路。所有这些情况说明了，我国建设事业的发展有可能快一些。在主观条件方面，我国建设事业的发展可能快一些，是由于我们党的领导是正确的，党的社会主义建设的总路线是正确的。我们党的领导和党的总路线所以是正确的，在于它是最科学的，是从客观实际的可能条件出发的，是遵循着客观的经济生活和政治生活的发展规律的，它又是最革命的，是充分承认和依靠六亿多人民的巨大的创造力量的；在于它把冷静的科学分析同坚决依靠群众的革命干劲卓越地结合起来。党的总路线的本质，是对六亿多人民群众在建设社会主义事业中的觉悟性、积极性、创造性的应有的高度重视。党的八大二次会议所通过的总路线的“基本点”，要求我们用正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法，调动一切积极因素到社会主义建设战线上来；用几个同时并举的方法（这是国民经济有计划、按比例发展规律在我国条件下的具体化），来开辟最广大的阵地，使最广大的人民群众的建设队伍能够展开，使他们的力量能够最充分地使用到社会主义建设事业中来，从而使多快好省地建设社会主义的要求的实现得到保证。从1956年到1958年逐步形成的党的社会主义建设总路线，在过去四年的实践中已经充分证明了它是完全正确的。但是右倾机会主义者却攻击党的领导，攻击党的把客观规律同人民群众的创造性结合起来、也就是把党的领导同最广大的群众运动结合起来的总路线，他们还把无限光明的当前政治经济形势说成是一团漆黑，这样就使他们自己达到了颠倒是非、混淆黑白的地步，这样他们就陷入了完全脱离实际、脱离群众的主观主义的泥坑，而在实际上完全站到资产阶级的反社会主义的立场上去了。
    第一书记挂帅是加强党的领导的组织保证
    要加强党对于社会主义建设事业的领导和贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，就必须用党的坚强的组织工作来保证。正是因为如此，在社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，党中央和毛泽东同志及时地指出，全党首先是各级党的委员会必须把主要精力放到建设事业上来，必须认真地抓、切实地抓。所谓认真地抓、切实地抓，就是要抓得准、抓得紧。党中央和毛泽东同志指出，要由党的各级党委的第一书记来直接抓建设工作，也就是要由第一书记来直接挂帅。由第一书记挂帅来领导建设工作，这就是对于建设事业实行政治挂帅在组织领导方面的具体化。正是由于各级党委第一书记直接挂帅，切实加强了各级党委对建设事业的领导，使党的坚强的领导同广大的群众运动密切地结合了起来，才实现了1958年建设事业的全面大跃进和全国农村的人民公社化，进一步实现了1959年建设事业的继续跃进，并且使人民公社走上了巩固的健全发展的道路。
    党委第一书记负责制，以及党委第一书记对某些最重要的工作直接挂帅，这同党委集体领导制、同党内的广大民主、同党的领导走群众路线，不但不是矛盾的，而且正是实现党委集体领导、发扬党内民主和执行群众路线的保证。我们在国家的政治生活中和党内生活中，都是实行民主集中制。这就是说，广大的党内党外群众所自由地提出的各种建议和批评，以及他们所创造的先进经验，必须由各级领导机关党的委员会来集中；而各级党委除了必须由党委委员分工负责各方面的工作之外，还必须由第一书记来负总的责任，由他来集中党委会的集体智慧、集中群众的意见和经验，并且领导党委会的工作。在这里，民主和集中，党的领导和群众路线，党委集体领导和第一书记挂帅，是互相依存、互相制约的，是相辅相成的。没有集中，就不可能有民主；没有党的领导，就无所谓群众路线；没有第一书记负总的责任，一个党委就是散的，就不可能发挥集体领导的作用。但是右倾机会主义分子却故意“忘记了”这些马克思列宁主义的最起码的真理，他们反对第一书记挂帅，硬说这是“不民主”，这是“独裁”。其实，他们只是要攻倒党的走群众路线的、民主集中制的无产阶级领导，而由他们自己来篡夺党的领导，由他们自己来实行反党的资产阶级独裁罢了。
    由上述看来，我们党同一小撮右倾机会主义分子关于要不要无产阶级政治挂帅，即要不要党的领导的争论，实际上是要不要社会主义的大争论，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的一场严重的思想斗争。我们党主张坚持无产阶级的政治挂帅，这实际上就是坚持社会主义制度，就是坚持多快好省地建设社会主义的正确道路，就是坚持根绝资本主义复辟可能性的大跃进运动和人民公社运动。右倾机会主义分子反对无产阶级政治挂帅，实际上就是不要社会主义制度，而企图复辟资本主义制度，实际上就是主张资产阶级的政治挂帅，即由他们自己来篡党、来“挂帅”，以便用他们的资产阶级世界观来改造党和改造中国社会。右倾机会主义分子的这种罪恶的企图已经被粉碎了。我们认真地学习和宣传党的八届八中全会的决议，坚持党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光荣旗帜，坚持党的政治挂帅的方针和群众路线的工作方法，彻底地批判和克服右倾机会主义的错误思想，无疑将会大大提高我们广大的干部和群众的社会主义和共产主义的觉悟水平，从而进一步地大大推进我们的社会主义建设事业。事实证明，我们党的领导是正确的，党的政治挂帅的方针是正确的，让我们全党同志和全国人民，在伟大的、光荣的、正确的党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，继续奋勇前进！
