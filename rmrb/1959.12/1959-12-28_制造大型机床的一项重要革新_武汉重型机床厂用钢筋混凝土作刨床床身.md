Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan — The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant has successfully trial-produced a gantry planer with a bed cast from reinforced concrete.

The National Appraisal Conference on Reinforced Concrete Machine Tools, recently held in Wuhan by the First Ministry of Machine Building, certified that this machine tool performs well. The rigidity of the concrete bed is no less than that of a cast iron bed, and the machine tool's precision and performance fully meet standards. This planer can process components 1.5 meters wide and 4 meters long. Cutting tests have shown that the precision of the processed components also meets the prescribed requirements.

Reinforced concrete machine tools are an important creation of the technical innovation movement in industrial enterprises last year. In order to develop this creation and consolidate the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, with the assistance of scientific research departments, conducted in-depth research on the structure and technology of this type of machine tool this year, and successfully trial-produced this reinforced concrete heavy-duty planer.

The National Appraisal Conference affirmed that reinforced concrete heavy-duty machine tools have five major advantages: (1) They save a significant amount of metal. The cast iron used per casting is reduced from 9,500 kilograms to more than 4,300 kilograms, and the wood consumed by wooden molds can also be saved. (2) They transform large castings into small castings, which is of great significance in overcoming the current difficulty of insufficient supply of large castings. The cast iron bed weighs 9,600 kilograms. After using a concrete bed, the largest casting is only 650 kilograms. (3) They shorten the production cycle and increase production capacity. For example, it generally takes 3,500 hours to make a cast iron model, while a cement casting can be completed in only 1,000 hours. Other processes, such as cooling and sand cleaning after casting, are also greatly shortened. (4) The process is changed from hot processing to cold processing, which greatly improves labor conditions. (5) Costs can be reduced by more than 1,000 yuan.

　　制造大型机床的一项重要革新
    武汉重型机床厂用钢筋混凝土作刨床床身
    据新华社武汉讯　武汉重型机床厂试制成功一台床身用钢筋混凝土浇铸成的龙门刨床。
    第一机械工业部最近在武汉举行的全国钢筋混凝土机床国家鉴定会议鉴定证明，这台机床性能良好，水泥床身的刚度不低于铸铁床身，机床精度和性能完全符合标准。这台刨床能加工宽一米五、长四米的部件，经过切削试验，加工出的部件精度也达到规定要求。
    钢筋混凝土机床是去年工业企业技术革新运动中的一项重要创造。武汉重型机床厂为了发展这个创造，巩固大跃进的成果，今年在科学研究部门的协助下，对这种机床的结构和工艺作了深入的研究，又试制成功这台钢筋混凝土重型刨床。
    国家鉴定会议肯定了钢筋混凝土重型机床具有五大优点：（1）大量节约金属，每台铸铁件所用的铸铁由九千五百公斤降低到四千三百多公斤，还可以节约木模所耗用的木材。（2）化大铸件为小铸件，对克服目前大型铸件供应不足的困难有重大作用。铸铁床身重九千六百公斤，改用混凝土床身后最大铸件仅六百五十公斤。（3）缩短生产周期，提高生产能力，例如铸铁模型一般要三千五百个小时作一个，而水泥铸件只要一千个小时就能完成，其他如浇铸后冷却和清砂时间都大为缩短。（4）由热加工改为冷加工，使劳动条件大为改善。（5）可以降低成本一千元以上。
