　　Highland Pasture Livestock in Herds
　　——Zengshan Agricultural Cooperative in Korea Vigorously Increases Livestock and Poultry
　　The Eulryongdeok Highland in Korea, 1,300 meters above sea level, is a natural good pasture. At present, it has become the base for the Zengshan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kwangchon County, South Hamgyong Province, Korea, to develop animal husbandry.

　　This agricultural cooperative responded to the call of the Korean Workers' Party - "Rely on the mountains to eat the mountains," and developed livestock breeding in accordance with local conditions.

　　When the Zengshan Agricultural Cooperative was first established, there were very few livestock, only eighteen pigs, fifty-six cattle, and fifteen sheep. But this year, in addition to producing thirty tons of pork, it has also raised more than 800 pigs, more than 200 cattle, and more than 300 sheep. This year's goal is to increase the number of pigs to 3,500, and efforts are now being made to increase the farrowing rate of sows. As the number of livestock and poultry increases, two cattle sheds, fifteen pig sheds, three sheep sheds, one chicken coop, and one rabbit shed have been built this year. At the same time, the agricultural cooperative has also established six livestock production teams with more than 230 breeders.

　　At present, in order to further develop animal husbandry, the agricultural cooperative is preparing to convert more land into forage land and turn the Eulryongdeok Highland into a forage base. The preliminary plan is to provide 350 tons of meat next year. The agricultural cooperative's livestock research team is actively carrying out research work, expanding livestock sheds, promoting advanced breeding technology, and carrying out livestock disease prevention work.

    高原牧场家畜成群
    ——朝鲜甑山农业社大力增殖牲畜家禽
    拔海一千三百米的朝鲜乙龙德高原是一个天然的好牧场。目前，这里已经成为朝鲜咸镜南道广泉郡甑山农业生产合作社发展畜牧业的基地。
    这个农业社响应朝鲜劳动党的号召——“靠山吃山”，因地制宜地发展了饲畜业。
  甑山农业社在刚成立时，牲畜很少，仅有十八头猪、五十六头牛和十五只羊。但是今年除了已经生产了三十吨猪肉外，还饲养了八百多口猪、二百多头牛、三百多只羊。今年的目标是：把猪的头数增加到三千五百头，现在正在提高母猪产仔率。由于牲畜家禽头数日益增多，今年已经兴建了两座牛舍、十五座猪舍、三座羊舍、一座鸡舍和一座兔舍。同时，农业社还成立了六个畜产班，有二百三十多名饲养员。
    目前，农业社为了进一步发展畜牧业，准备把更多的土地改变为饲料用地，把乙龙德高原变成饲料基地。初步计划明年提供三百五十吨肉类。农业社的饲畜研究小组正在积极开展研究工作，扩充畜舍，推广先进饲养技术，开展家畜防疫工作。
