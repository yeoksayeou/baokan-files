    Monkey Bird
    In the zoo, we have seen all kinds of exotic birds and animals, but there is also a unique and rare bird - the monkey bird - that we have not yet seen, which was just discovered in the deep mountains and dense forests of Guizhou. Newsreel No. 67 has a preliminary introduction to its image and habits.
    This bird's head looks like a monkey, so it is called the monkey bird; and because it is born fierce and its habits are somewhat like an owl, it is also called the monkey-headed eagle.
    It is a carnivorous bird. It is quite large, about one meter tall, and weighs about ten to twenty kilograms. Even the newly born chicks weigh more than half a kilogram.

    猴鸟
    在动物园里，我们看见过各式各样的奇禽异兽，但是还有一种奇特的珍禽——猴鸟，我们还没有看见过，是在贵州的深山密林里刚发现的。新闻简报六十七号中，对它的形象、习性有初步介绍。
    这种鸟的头部像猴子，所以叫猴鸟；又因为它生来凶猛，习性有些像猫头鹰，所以也叫猴头鹰。
    它是一种吃肉食的鸟。它的体积相当大，高约一米，重约十到二十公斤。就连刚生下来的小雏鸟，也有半公斤多重。
