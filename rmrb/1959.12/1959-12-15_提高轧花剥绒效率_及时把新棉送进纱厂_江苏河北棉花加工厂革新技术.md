To Improve Cotton Ginning and Delinting Efficiency: Deliver New Cotton to Spinning Mills Promptly
Jiangsu and Hebei Cotton Processing Plants Innovate Technology

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 14th dispatch) Jiangsu Province's cotton processing departments are vigorously engaging in mass movements and technical innovations, achieving a double leap forward in high-yield and high-quality ginning and delinting. Up to now, the province has processed a cumulative amount of ginned cotton, accounting for 90% of the new cotton entering the factories, an increase of more than 30% compared with the same period last year. Short绒 (rong) production has also increased month by month. In the three months since the new cotton was put on the market, a total of 100,000 dan of short 绒 have been delinted, which is 70% more than the amount of delinting in the same period last year. Product quality has also improved significantly, with an average impurity content of 2.2% for ginned cotton.

As early as May, more than 80 power ginning factories in the province overhauled their machines and made preparations for processing. During the technical innovation movement, workers at the Xushi Ginning Factory in Changshu County manufactured an automatic oiler to replace manual oiling, saving half an hour of downtime for oiling each machine in ten hours. As a result, the entire factory can gin an additional 4,000 jin of ginned cotton per day. The nine ginning factories in the province with saw gins absorbed the advanced experience of Soviet comrade Roganov's "new type ginning working box", enlarged the cotton roll box, and appropriately increased the speed of the saw shaft, so that the output per unit time of ginned cotton increased from an average of 600 jin to more than 900 jin.

Various localities have also vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution in short 绒 production. Nanyang Ginning Factory in Qidong County created a short 绒 continuous cleaning device, which reduced the impurity content of short 绒 by 50%. In the delinting production, this factory firmly grasped the "seven-character" operation method—safety operation (安), cleaning cotton seeds (清), milling saw blades and grinding iron filings (铣), blocking regulating parts and matching cotton seed flow (挡), separating down collection, separate collection and bundling, separate weight and grade (分), cleaning foot down, achieving daily cleaning (理), maintaining the gap between each part, keeping saw blades sharp, and maintaining the angle of saw teeth (保). As a result, they seized high yield and high quality. The average output per unit time of short 绒 in the factory was more than 60 jin, and the amount of short 绒 delinted per 100 jin of cotton seeds was 7 jin, with an impurity content of only 4%, reaching the most advanced level in the province. The "seven-character" method of high-yield and high-quality short 绒 production in this factory has been promoted throughout the province.

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 14th dispatch) Cotton processing departments in Hebei Province are vigorously carrying out technical innovation and tapping production potential, accelerating the progress of ginning and delinting production. As of December 6, the amount of ginned cotton processed accounted for 51% of the total purchase volume, and short 绒 production had completed 30% of the annual plan (from September this year to August next year) by the end of November.

The Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province grasped the work of ginning and short 绒 production early and tightly. According to the cotton purchase situation this year, they began to repair and install equipment and train technicians as early as July. Large-scale collaboration was carried out between regions and between factories. After the cotton was put on the market, the cotton processing departments in the province launched a production competition with technical innovation as the main content, mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and suggestions, and tapped the potential of existing equipment. The advanced experiences created and promoted in various places in terms of ginning include expanding the cotton roll box, changing small saw teeth to large saw teeth; transforming the hulling ribs to increase the amount of cotton eaten; accelerating the speed of the beater roller of the cotton cleaner, and expanding the amount of cotton fed, etc. The output of ginning has increased rapidly. The average output per unit time in the province has increased from the original 2,000 jin to 2,500 jin to 3,000 jin, and the highest has reached 3,500 jin. In terms of delinting production, the main measures taken were to improve workers' skills, grasp the appropriate density of the cotton seed room, implement light holding and skillful holding, and also adopt methods such as strengthening machine maintenance, regular filing and grinding, and multi-channel impurity removal, so that the short 绒 output per unit time reached 40 jin to 60 jin, an increase of about 20% compared with last year. The quality of short 绒 meets the prescribed standards. The three-channel delinting method has been universally promoted in the province, increasing the delinting rate by 5% to 6%.

    提高轧花剥绒效率　及时把新棉送进纱厂
    江苏河北棉花加工厂革新技术
    本报南京14日电　江苏省棉花加工部门大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新，轧花、剥绒高产优质双跃进。到目前为止，全省累计加工的皮棉，占进厂新棉的90％，比去年同期增加30％以上。短绒产量也逐月上升。新棉上市三个多月来，共剥短绒十万担，比去年同期剥绒量多七成。产品质量也有显著提高，皮棉含杂率平均为2.2％。
    早在5月份，全省八十多家动力轧花厂就把机器检修好，做好了加工准备工作。在技术革新运动中，常熟县徐市轧花厂职工制造了一种自动加油器代替人工加油，每部车在十小时中节省了半小时停车加油的时间，全厂因此每天可以多轧皮棉四千斤。全省拥有锯齿机的九个轧花厂，吸取了苏联罗加诺夫同志“新型轧花工作箱”的先进经验，放大棉卷箱，适当加快锯轴转速，使台时皮棉产量平均从六百斤增加到九百斤以上。
    各地在短绒生产中也大搞技术革新和技术革命。启东县南阳轧花厂创造了一种短绒连续清杂器，使短绒含杂率降低50％。这个厂在剥绒生产中紧紧掌握“七字”操作法——安（安全操作），清（清理棉籽），铣（铣好锯片、磨净铁屑），挡（挡好调节部分，配好棉籽流量），分（分道收绒、分收分捆、分磅分级），理（清理脚绒，做到班清日净），保（保持各部间隙、保持锯片锋利、保持锯齿角度），结果夺取了高产优质。全厂短绒平均台时产量六十多斤，每百斤棉籽剥短绒七斤，含杂率只有4％，达到全省最先进的水平。这个厂的短绒生产高产优质的“七字”法，已在全省推广。
    本报天津14日电　河北省棉花加工部门大搞技术革新，挖掘生产潜力，使轧花、剥绒生产进度加快。到12月6日，加工皮棉占总收购量的51％，短绒生产至11月底完成年度计划（由今年9月到明年8月）的30％。
    河北省各级党委对轧花和短绒生产工作抓得早，抓得紧。根据今年棉花收购情况，早在7月就开始检修和安装设备，训练技术人员。地区之间、厂与厂之间开展了大协作。棉花上市以后，全省棉花加工部门开展了以技术革新为主要内容的生产竞赛，发动群众献计献策，挖掘现有设备潜力。各地在轧花方面创造和推广的先进经验有扩大卷棉箱，小锯齿改换大锯齿；改造阻壳肋条，增加吃花量；加快清花机刺辊转数，扩大喂棉量等等。轧花产量迅速提高。全省平均台时产量，由原来的二千斤，提高二千五百斤到三千斤，最高达到三千五百斤。在剥绒生产方面，主要是提高工人技术，掌握棉籽室的适当密度，实行轻托、巧托，另外采取了加强机器检修保养、定时锉磨、多道排杂等办法，使短绒台时产量达到四十斤到六十斤，比去年提高20％左右。短绒质量达到规定标准。全省普遍推行了三道剥绒法，提高剥绒率5％到6％。
