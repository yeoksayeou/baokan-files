Anhui Rice Bran Oil Extraction Rate Reaches 9.93%

    (Our report) Anhui Province is vigorously promoting rice bran oil extraction, increasing oil production by more than 2.4 million jin in three months. Rice bran oil can be used to extract glycerin and rice bran wax to manufacture soap, hardened oil, and lubricating oil. After refining, it can also be eaten. The bran cake after oil extraction is a very good feed.

    The use of rice bran to extract oil by the grain departments of Anhui Province started in Binghui County. In August of this year, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions requiring various localities to carefully study and promote rice bran oil extraction. Now, the rice milling factories of the grain departments throughout the province have added ninety-three oil extraction workshops. Due to the diligent promotion of advanced oil extraction experience in various places, the average oil extraction rate of rice bran has also increased from 7.39% in the past to 9.93%.
