Gansu Water Conservancy Scientific Research Promotes Production
    Solved Many Urgent Problems in Water Conservancy Construction

    (Our Dispatch) Gansu Province's water conservancy scientific research departments, facing the masses and practical needs, have creatively researched and solved many urgent problems in water conservancy construction, powerfully promoting production.
    With the assistance of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and the Ministry of Geology, Gansu Province's water conservancy scientific research departments have already put forward more than thirty production reports and research reports in this year's thirteen projects and forty-nine major research topics. Among them, eight research achievements, such as cobblestone lining, loess seepage prevention and anti-collapsibility, and mountain irrigation, have been proven to have high economic value and theoretical significance through appraisal and production practice. At the same time, through these studies, the veil of "scientific mystery" has been torn off, making water conservancy scientific research a mass activity.
    The mass water conservancy construction in Gansu Province has presented a series of new topics to water conservancy scientists. For example, in the Hexi Corridor, where agriculture is impossible without irrigation and close to the Gobi Desert, the annual utilization of Qilian Mountain snowmelt for irrigation amounts to more than 9.7 billion cubic meters. However, due to the lack of water diversion control and anti-leakage projects, the water loss in canals reaches 60% to 70%. Solving this urgent canal lining project problem using modern engineering facilities faces many difficulties in terms of investment, time, technical force, and material supply. The water conservancy scientific research departments summarized and improved the masses' experience in using cobblestones and sod to reinforce gates and protect against danger, and successfully extended the anti-scouring and anti-leakage lining projects from small canals to large canals. Canals lined according to standards have improved safety and anti-scouring capacity, and the anti-leakage efficiency has also been reduced from 70% canal water loss to about 11%. The masses' experience, when scientifically summarized and improved, demonstrates its advantages and economic value. It is not damaged by freezing forces, facilitates winter irrigation, and is easy to maintain. It utilizes cobblestones, which can be sourced locally, shortening the construction period by one to three years while greatly reducing project costs, in line with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. It also theoretically shattered the notion that "cobblestones cannot form a structured whole," opening up avenues for implementing the "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and "walking on two legs" policy.
    The water conservancy project of diverting the Tao River up the mountain is a great initiative by the people of Gansu to transform nature and eradicate drought. However, more than two-thirds of this 1,400-kilometer-long canal winds around mountains and passes through loess areas, easily causing seepage, collapsibility, and collapse in the canal project. Therefore, how to reduce seepage losses and avoid collapsibility damage to ensure the safe operation of the canal, improve the effective coefficient of the canal, and expand the irrigation area is an urgent problem to be solved. There are many new methods to solve this problem. Water conservancy researchers chose the method of compacting loess and compacting a mixture of loess, lime, and red soil, which are easily accepted by the local masses and cost-effective, and set up research stations in the construction area to organize mass experiments and research. The results proved that the strongly collapsible, large-pore loess along the main canal of the Tao River Diversion significantly changes in soil quality once compacted in layers, reducing the permeability coefficient and weakening the collapsibility performance. In order to avoid cracks in the seepage prevention layer due to intermittent water release, climate, water erosion, and other factors, a protective layer is laid on the seepage prevention layer. This can ensure the effectiveness of the seepage prevention layer and extend its lifespan. The solution of this problem guarantees the smooth progress of the Tao River Diversion project.
    Gansu Province's water conservancy scientific research work has developed vigorously in a short period of time, powerfully promoting the leap forward in water conservancy construction. This is a victory for the Party's policy of facing the masses and facing practical needs, and also the result of continuous struggle against various forms of bourgeois ideology and right-leaning conservative thought. They resolutely implement the policy of closely integrating scientific and technological research with production and follow the mass line. They pay attention to summarizing the masses' experience, and regard the construction site as a school, the project as teaching material, and entrust the scientific and technological research work to the masses. On the Tao River Diversion project site alone, more than 600 Red and Expert schools were held, training 15 "native experts," more than 230 "native engineers," and thousands of peasant technicians. These peasant technicians have rich practical knowledge. Once combined with scientific and technological personnel with scientific knowledge, and "native" and "foreign" methods are used in parallel, water conservancy scientific research work, like spring buds, blooms brightly in an instant.

    甘肃水利科学研究推进生产
    解决了水利建设中许多急待解决的课题
    本报讯　甘肃省水利科学研究部门面向群众，面向实际，创造性地研究和解决了水利建设中许多急待解决的课题，有力地推动了生产。
    甘肃省水利科学研究部门在中国科学院、水利电力部、地质部等的协助下，在今年的十三个项目、四十九个主要研究课题中，已经提出了三十多个生产报告和研究报告。其中卵石衬砌、黄土防渗和防湿陷以及山地灌溉等八项研究成果，经过鉴定和生产实践，证明有很高的经济价值和理论意义。同时，通过这些研究，撕下了“科学神秘”的帷幕，使水利科学研究成为群众性的活动。
    甘肃省群众性的兴修水利给水利科学工作者提出了一系列新课题。例如，在地近戈壁，没有灌溉就没有农业的河西走廊，那里每年利用祁连山雪水灌溉，年水量有九十七亿多立公方。但是，由于缺乏引水控制和防漏工程，渠水损失量达60％到70％。这个迫切需要解决的衬砌渠道工程问题，如果采用现代化的工程设施来解决，在投资、时间、技术力量和物资供应上都有许多困难。水利科学研究部门总结和提高群众用卵石、草皮镶闸护险的经验，由小型渠道推广到大型渠道的防冲、防漏的衬砌工程上，获得成功。按照标准衬砌的渠道，安全抗冲能力提高了，防漏效能也由渠水损失70％降低到11％左右。群众的这项经验，从科学上加以总结和提高，就显示了它的优点和经济价值。它不受冰冻力的破坏，利于冬灌，容易护养。它利用卵石，就地取材，可以缩短工期一到三年，同时可以大大降低工程造价，符合多快好省原则。它还从理论上粉碎了“卵石不能组成有结构的整体”的说法，为贯彻“土洋并举”和“两条腿走路”的方针开辟了道路。
    引洮上山的水利工程是甘肃人民改造自然、根治干旱的伟大创举。可是，这条长达一千四百公里的渠道，三分之二以上盘绕山岭，经过黄土地区，容易造成渠道工程的渗漏、湿陷和塌坍。因此，怎样减少渗漏损失和避免湿陷破坏，以保证渠道安全运行、提高渠道有效系数、扩大灌溉面积，是迫切需要解决的问题。解决这个问题的新法很多，水利科学研究人员选择了当地群众容易接受和费用省收效宏的黄土夯实和黄土、石灰、红土掺合夯实的办法，深入工区设研究站，组织群众性的试验研究。结果证明：引洮总渠沿线的强湿陷大孔性黄土，一经分层夯实，土质就大大改变，渗透系数变小，湿陷性能减弱。为了避免因为间歇放水、气候、水流冲削等因素，防止防渗层发生裂缝，又在防渗层上铺填保护层。这就可以确保防渗层的效果并且延长它的寿命。这个问题的解决，保证了引洮工程的顺利进行。
    甘肃省的水利科学研究工作，在短时间就蓬勃开展，有力地推动水利建设事业的跃进，这是党的面向群众、面向实际的方针的胜利，也是不断地向形形色色的资产阶级思想和右倾保守思想斗争的结果。他们坚决贯彻执行科学技术研究紧密结合生产的方针，走群众路线。他们注意总结群众经验，而且把工地当作学校，把工程当作教材，把科学技术研究工作交给群众。光是引洮工程工地就举办红专学校六百多所，培养了“土专家”十五名，“土工程师”二百三十多名，以及成千上万的农民技术员。这些农民技术人员具有丰富的实践知识，一旦同具有科学知识的科学技术人员结合，“土”“洋”并举，水利科学研究工作就像春天的蓓蕾一样，转眼间花开灿烂。
