Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 1st - The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council held a mass rally here on the evening of December 1st for "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day."

The conference began with the song "Let Africa Be Free." The first speaker was Toufiq Madani, the Algerian Minister of Cultural Affairs. He said that the slogan "Get Out of Africa" has been known to Africans since childhood.

Speaking about the current struggle in Algeria, Madani said that Algeria is experiencing the first month of the sixth year of the war against French imperialists. He expressed Algeria's readiness to fight to the end until independence is achieved. He expressed his belief that Algerians, along with other Africans, will dig the grave for imperialism.

Osende Afana, the Cameroonian Secretary of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, delivered a speech on behalf of the Secretariat. He reviewed how, in the year since the last "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," the climax of Africa's struggle for freedom spread to the Congo, Nyasaland, Rhodesia, and other parts of the African continent.

Afana strongly condemned the United States' aggressive policies in Asia. He accused U.S. imperialism of supporting the Lao government, which is undermining the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreement, turning Laos into a U.S. military base.

Afana condemned the United States for occupying China's inalienable territory, Taiwan. He also condemned the United States' conspiracy to extend its occupation of Japan under the pretext of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He said that the Afro-Asian people need no protection other than vigilance against imperialism.

Afana exposed the hypocrisy of the French colonialists' granting of independence to Cameroon, and pointed out that Cameroon is still filled with an atmosphere of terror. He condemned French colonialism for forcibly imposing enslaving economic and military agreements on Cameroon.

UAE representative Fadel Galal spoke at the conference, exposing the essence of the West's so-called "mission to spread civilization" in Africa, and expressed support for the African national movement.

The conference passed a resolution calling on African freedom fighters to intensify their struggle for complete independence and freedom. The resolution also called on all freedom-loving people around the world to support the African national liberation movement.

The resolution called on the United Nations to take action to promote the independence of African countries and to investigate the situation in African countries under the iron curtain of Spanish and Portuguese rule.

The resolution said: "We are fully convinced that no one, and no force, is powerful enough to stop the upsurge of the African people to fight for freedom and equality with other peoples of the world."

The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council also sent telegrams to the United Nations and the heads of state of Asian and African countries, requesting them to support the African people's struggle for freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 1st - Soviet newspapers today published editorials and articles on "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," supporting the just struggle of the African people for national independence and freedom.

The article in "Pravda" said that Africa has stood up. The past year has been a year of fierce battles for the African people on the front lines of the struggle for national liberation. The heroic Algerian people have waged an armed struggle for freedom, the land under the feet of the Belgian colonialists is also burning, the Congolese people have risen up to fight, and the independence movement in Cameroon is strengthening. The people of British and Portuguese colonies are all fighting. The entire African continent supports the slogan "Independence in our generation."

The article said that U.S. capital has been injected into Africa. In the past fifteen years, U.S. investment in Africa has increased ninefold, reaching two billion U.S. dollars. The African people cannot fail to see that what is replacing the monopolistic capital of British, French, and Belgian imperialism is the monopolistic capital of U.S. imperialism.

The article emphasized that Africa has sincere and selfless friends, namely the people of socialist countries, millions of Asian people, and honest workers in Europe and the Americas. With their support, the African people will eventually break free from the shackles of colonial enslavement.

The editorial in "Izvestia" pointed out that U.S. monopoly organizations and U.S. aggressive blocs are trying to break into Africa to replace the old colonial powers. U.S. imperialism has now become the main pillar of colonialism. The new colonialists are tightly wrapped around Africa's body; they will not want to get out of the African continent unless they are beaten.

The editorial said that Africa is no longer willing to be a slave to imperialist colonialists. The African people demand to manage their own rich mineral resources.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Soviet people are convinced that, with the support of all progressive humanity, the African people will eliminate the shameful system of colonial oppression, unite their ranks, and embark on the broad road of progress and prosperity.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, December 1st - The Burmese Trade Union Congress issued a statement today on "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," firmly supporting the just struggle of the African people for national independence.

The statement said that French colonialists are barbarically massacring the Algerian people. Its establishment of military bases and its intention to conduct nuclear weapons tests in the Sahara Desert are threatening the African people's struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace.

The statement strongly condemned and protested against the Western imperialists who suppress and persecute the African people, and demanded that they must withdraw from Africa.

    阿法纳谴责美国霸占中国不可分割的领土台湾。他还谴责美国在修改日美“安全条约”的借口下，延长它霸占日本的阴谋。他说，亚非人民除了警戒帝国主义以外，不需要任何保护。
    阿法纳揭露了法国殖民主义者允许喀麦隆独立的虚伪性，并且指出，喀麦隆仍然充满着恐怖的气氛。他谴责法国殖民主义对喀麦隆强行实施奴役性的经济和军事协定。

    新华社莫斯科1日电　苏联各报今天就“帝国主义滚出非洲日”发表社论和文章，支持非洲人民争取民族独立和自由的正义斗争。
    “真理报”的文章中说，非洲已经站立起来。过去的一年是非洲人民在争取民族解放的战线上进行激烈战斗的一年。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民为自由进行了武装斗争，比利时殖民者脚下的土地也正在燃烧，刚果人民起来斗争了，喀麦隆的独立运动正在加强。英国、葡萄牙的殖民地人民都在进行斗争。整个非洲大陆都支持“我们这一代的生活要独立”的口号。
    文章说，美国资本已在注入非洲，最近十五年来美国在非洲的投资增加了九倍，达到了二十亿美元。非洲人民不能不看到，代替英、法、比利时帝国主义垄断资本的是美帝国主义垄断资本。
    文章强调说，非洲有着真诚无私的朋友，这就是社会主义各国人民、千百万亚洲人民和正直的欧洲、美洲的劳动者。在他们的支持之下，非洲人民一定会最终地摆脱殖民主义奴役的锁链。
    “消息报”的社论指出，美国垄断组织、美国侵略集团力图打进非洲去，以取代老牌的殖民主义国家。美国帝国主义现在已成为殖民主义的主要支柱。新殖民主义者紧紧地缠在非洲的身体上，不打他们，他们总不想滚出非洲大陆。
    社论说，但是，非洲已经不愿意再给帝国主义殖民主义者当奴隶了。非洲人民要求自己来管理自己的丰富的矿藏。
