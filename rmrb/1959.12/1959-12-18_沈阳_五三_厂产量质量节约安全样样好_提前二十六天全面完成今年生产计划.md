Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 17th: The workers of the Shenyang "May 3rd" Factory, which won the Red Flag at the National Conference of Heroes, have comprehensively completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule. As of December 5th, the factory's total output value exceeded the annual state plan by 8.28%, all product varieties were completed according to plan at 100%, the output of the main product, electric motors, exceeded the plan by 7.19%, product costs were reduced by 5.05% compared to the plan, labor productivity increased by 8.38% compared to the plan, profits submitted to the state completed 144.58% of the plan, and the quality of all products exceeded the planned targets.

This year, because the factory grasped the leadership of ideology and production from the beginning, it successfully completed the state plan in the first quarter. On this basis, all factory workers launched a grand competition for high quality, high output, conservation, and safety, and carried out a major inspection campaign on quality, safety, and equipment, ensuring the comprehensive completion of the first half of the year's state plan twelve days ahead of schedule, and quickly breaking through the fourteen key quality points of electric motor products, improving the quality of electric motors. Due to the continuous increase in production, temporary difficulties in material supply appeared in July, and a right-leaning conservative ideology of "determining production by materials and conserving resources" arose among some cadres. The factory's Party Committee immediately launched a struggle against right-leaning conservatism throughout the factory, boosted the enthusiasm of cadres and workers, and re-revised the plan, increasing the third quarter plan by 34% compared to the original plan, and new situations of red every ten days, red every month, and all-around red continuously appeared in production. In order to ensure the early completion of the annual plan, all factory workers also extensively carried out technical performance competitions with technical innovation and technical revolution as the main content.

At present, the factory has launched a technical transformation movement with the improvement of mechanization and automation as the main content and technical performance competitions as the basic form, striving to increase the production of urgently needed products for the country before the end of the year.

    沈阳“五三”厂产量质量节约安全样样好
    提前二十六天全面完成今年生产计划
    新华社沈阳17日电　荣获全国群英会红旗的沈阳市“五三”工厂职工，提前全面完成了今年的国家计划。到12月5日止，这个工厂的生产总值超过了全年国家计划8.28％，全部产品品种已按计划100％完成，主要产品电机产量超过计划7.19％，产品成本比计划降低了5.05％，劳动生产率比计划提高8.38％，上缴利润完成计划144.58％，各种产品质量都超过计划指标。
    这个工厂今年由于一开始就抓紧了思想和生产的领导，在第一季度就出色地完成了国家计划。在这一基础上，全厂职工又大搞优质、高产、节约、安全满堂红竞赛，开展了质量、安全、设备大检查运动，保证了提前十二天全面完成了上半年国家计划，并且迅速突破了电机产品的十四项质量关键，提高了电机质量。由于生产不断增加，7月份出现了材料供应暂时困难的情况，在某些干部中产生了“以料定产，细水长流”的右倾保守思想。这个厂党委立即在全厂开展了反右倾保守的斗争，鼓起了干部、工人的干劲，重新修订了计划，使第三季度计划比原订计划增大34％，生产上连续出现了旬旬红、月月红、满堂红的新局面。为了保证提前完成全年计划，全厂职工还以技术革新和技术革命为主要内容广泛开展了技术表演赛。
    目前这个工厂掀起了一个以提高机械化、自动化程度为主要内容，以技术表演赛为基本形式的技术改造运动，争取年底以前再为国家增产一批急需的产品。
