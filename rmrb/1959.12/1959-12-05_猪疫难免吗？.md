    Is Swine Fever Inevitable?
    Currently, all regions are actively developing pig farming. To meet the needs of the rapid development of pig farming, people are trying every possible means to find feed, build pigsties, and increase the number of piglets. Undoubtedly, these are important measures in developing pig farming. However, preventing swine fever and increasing the survival rate of pigs are also crucial measures for the high-speed development of pig farming.
    Can swine fever be prevented and controlled? Some people are skeptical about this question. They believe that swine fever is inevitable; no matter how many pigs are raised and how well they are raised, an outbreak of disease will render all previous efforts futile, thereby reducing the interest in pig farming. Swine fever is indeed a difficult problem in pig farming. In the past, pig farming generally had a disease mortality rate of several percent, and in areas where diseases were severe, the mortality rate even reached 20% to 30%, resulting in significant losses. However, we must not conclude from this that swine fever is inevitable. In the Jiaoxie Management Area of Gushi Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, due to good prevention and control work, the disease mortality rate of pigs has been reduced from 22% last year to 2.3%; the Qiufeng Production Team raised more than 400 pigs, and not a single pig has contracted any disease or died this year. This fact shows that swine fever can be avoided.
    The key to doing a good job in epidemic prevention is to follow the mass line. As the saying goes, "A single prescription can anger a famous doctor." This sentence does not belittle famous doctors, but rather it means that the masses have some prevention and control methods that are not only simple and convenient to use, inexpensive, but also very effective. Many people with experience in raising pigs among the masses are also often experienced in treating pig diseases. Although they cannot explain the complete set of scientific principles, a slight operation can produce immediate results. These are all favorable conditions for us to prevent and control swine fever. Of course, while universally adopting these "local" methods, we should also adopt "foreign" methods as much as possible, such as injecting vaccines. Combining "local" and "foreign" methods and using them flexibly will naturally have greater effects.
    Secondly, to do a good job in epidemic prevention, it is necessary to implement the principle of attaching equal importance to prevention and treatment, with emphasis on prevention. "Although the medicine for knife wounds is effective, it is better not to get cut." If a pig gets sick, there is a risk of death. Even if it can be cured and death is avoided, it will still have a great impact on the pig's growth and development, and it will also increase some difficulties in feeding management. If we can do a good job in prevention and make the disease not occur or occur less frequently, it will be of great benefit to the development of pig farming. Therefore, when implementing the principle of attaching equal importance to prevention and treatment, emphasis should be placed on prevention. To achieve this, we must carefully study and grasp the laws of occurrence and causes of swine fever, and then carry out mass epidemic prevention work according to different regions, different seasons, and different pig breeds: on the one hand, improve feeding management, and on the other hand, carry out immunization injections to reduce or even eliminate the occurrence of diseases. Thanks to good prevention work, Jiangsu Province has further controlled the epidemic of pig diseases. Several key pig-raising counties in the Lixiahe area have not experienced any infectious diseases such as swine fever this year. The work experience of these regions is worthy of attention.
    Finally, let's talk about whether prevention and control should have a focus. Some people believe that fat pigs are of great value and accumulate a lot of fertilizer, so fat pigs should be the focus of prevention and control; it doesn't matter if a piglet dies, as not much effort has been put into it. Others emphasize that piglets are very scarce and their resistance to diseases is poor, so the focus of prevention and control should be on piglets. We say that these two views are not comprehensive and both approaches have shortcomings. Large pigs are important, and piglets are also important. Attention should be paid to the prevention and control of diseases in both large and small pigs. Large pigs grow up from piglets. Without piglets, where do large pigs come from? If we don't pay attention to large pigs, what is the purpose of raising piglets well? Moreover, the disease itself is contagious and will not only occur within the scope of large pigs or piglets. Therefore, we must pay attention to both large and small pigs and do a good job in prevention and control to develop pig farming faster.

### 猪疫难免吗？

    猪疫难免吗？
    目前各地都在积极发展养猪事业。为了适应养猪事业大发展的需要，人们正在千方百计地寻找饲料、修盖栏圈和增加仔猪。毫无疑问，这些都是发展养猪事业中的重要措施。但是，防治猪疫，提高猪的成活率，是高速度发展养猪事业的又一个重要措施。
    猪疫能不能防治？在这个问题上有人持怀疑态度，他们认为猪疫难免；猪养得再多再好，疫病一发，就会前功尽弃，因而降低了养猪的兴趣。猪疫的确是养猪事业中的一个难关。过去养猪一般都有百分之几的疫病死亡率，疫病流行严重的地方死亡率甚至达到20％到30％，损失很大。但是，绝不能由此得出结论，认为猪疫难免。陕西渭南县固市公社交斜管理区由于防治工作做得好，猪的疫病死亡率由去年的22％降低到2.3％；秋丰生产队养的四百多头猪，今年没有一头猪发生疫病和死亡。这个事实说明：猪疫是可以避免的。
    做好防疫工作的关键是走群众路线。常言说“单方气死名医”。这句话并不是轻视名医，而是说群众中有一些防治办法，它不仅用起来简单方便，花钱不多，而且效果很好。群众中很多养猪有经验的人，常常也是治猪病有经验的人，尽管他们说不出成套的科学原理，但略施手术便能立见功效。这些都是我们防治猪疫病的有利条件。当然，在普遍采用这些“土”办法的同时，也要尽可能地采用“洋”办法，如注射防疫针等。“土”办法和“洋”办法兼收并蓄，灵活使用，效果自然会更大。
    其次，做好防疫工作要贯彻防治并重、以防为主的方针。“刀创药虽灵，不割为妙。”猪生了病就有死亡的危险，即使能治好，避免了死亡，但对猪的生长发育也有很大影响，饲养管理上也要增加一些困难。如果能做好预防工作，使疫病不发生或者少发生，对发展养猪事业会有很多好处。所以，在执行防治并重的方针时，应当是以防为主。要做到这一点，就必须认真研究并掌握猪疫的发生规律、发生原因，然后才能根据不同地区、不同季节、不同猪种，开展群众性的防疫工作：一面改善饲养管理，一面进行防疫注射，减少以至消灭疫病的发生。江苏省由于预防工作做得好，已经进一步控制了猪病疫的流行，里下河地区几个重点养猪县今年根本没有发生猪瘟等传染病。这些地区的工作经验都值得重视。
    最后，谈一谈防治要不要有重点的问题。有人认为肥猪价值大，积肥多，应该以肥猪为防治重点；小猪没花多少工本，死个把也无关紧要。也有人强调仔猪很缺，猪小抵抗病疫的力量差，防治重点应当是小猪。我们说，这两种主张都不全面，两种做法都有缺点。大猪重要，小猪也重要，大猪小猪的疫病都要注意防治。大猪是由小猪长大的，没有小猪，大猪从何而来？不重视大猪，养好小猪的目的又是什么呢？而且疫病本身是有传染性的，不会仅仅发生在大猪或者小猪的范围内。因此，必须对大小猪同时重视，切实做好防治工作，才能更快地发展养猪事业。
