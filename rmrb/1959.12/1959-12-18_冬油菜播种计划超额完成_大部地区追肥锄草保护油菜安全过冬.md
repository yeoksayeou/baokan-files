Xinhua News Agency, December 17th—The winter rapeseed sowing plan in nineteen provinces (municipalities) across the country has been exceeded. This year's winter rapeseed is more and better sown than in any year since liberation. Currently, the vast majority of rapeseed has dark green leaves and is growing well. People's communes in various regions are actively organizing labor to topdress, weed, control pests, and dredge ditches for rapeseed, cultivate strong seedlings, and strive for safe wintering.

This year, rapeseed in most areas was sown under drought conditions. During September and October, when rapeseed was being sown, many areas suffered from drought, severely affecting the progress of sowing. However, by implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, combating Rightist tendencies, and boosting morale, various regions fully utilized the superiority of the People's Communes, organized large-scale cooperation and shock work, overcame natural disasters, and completed drought-resistant emergency sowing. After criticizing the idea of relying on heaven for rain, the Guanye Temple Management District of the Nanhai People's Commune in Hanzhong City, Shaanxi, adopted methods such as irrigation and rushed plowing, completing the sowing of one thousand mu of rapeseed in two days.

The characteristics of this winter's rapeseed sowing are more, faster, earlier, and better. Before sowing, People's Communes in various regions summarized last year's high-yield experiences and further implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." Whether direct seeding or transplanting, it was generally ten to twenty days earlier than last year, and the sowing speed was increased by more than 50%, achieving timely sowing. In Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan and other nine provinces and cities, approximately 80% of the rapeseed sown was deeply ploughed to five or six inches or more, of which about 10% was deeply ploughed to one foot or more. This year, most areas applied about 3,000 to 5,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and the fertilizer quality was generally improved compared to last year. In Sichuan Province, a high-yield rapeseed area, more than 60% of the rapeseed was fertilized with more than 10,000 jin per mu this year. In Hubei Province, the amount of fertilizer applied to rapeseed was generally increased by 30% to 50% compared to last year. Most areas further achieved rational close planting according to specific conditions and local conditions. In Sichuan Province, the number of plants per mu has generally increased from 5,000 to 6,000 last year to 6,000 to 10,000. In Hubei Province, the general planting density is 10,000 to 20,000 plants per mu. In Zhong County, Sichuan Province, the sowing quality has been generally improved. The more than 50,000 mu of rapeseed sown in the county are all Victory Rapeseed improved varieties. The area deeply ploughed to more than eight inches accounts for about 75%. Generally, 4,000 to 5,000 jin of fine fertilizer and 10,000 jin of compost are used as base fertilizer per mu, and the density is generally doubled compared with last year.

While expanding the rapeseed sowing area, many areas mobilized the masses to use "marginal land" and other gaps to cultivate "Rapeseed Kings" in an effort to harvest more. At present, six provinces including Sichuan, Guizhou, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Hunan have planted more than 1.9 billion "Rapeseed Kings" (or nests), of which Sichuan Province has more than 1.6 billion nests.

Winter rapeseed in various regions is generally growing better than in the same period last year. According to the classification and ranking of rapeseed in nine provinces and cities including Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, the first-class seedlings that have grown six to seven true leaves, are growing vigorously, are free from diseases and pests, and have no missing seedlings account for about 41%; the second-class seedlings that have four to six true leaves and are growing shorter account for about 37%; and the third-class seedlings that are growing poorly account for about 21%. After the rapeseed sowing ended, various regions successively shifted to field management. At present, in addition to some late-sown rapeseed fields that are still being checked and replanted, most areas are intensively applying topdressing, weeding, cultivating soil, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. According to incomplete statistics from ten provinces and cities including Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, as of the beginning of this month, 50%-60% of the rapeseed has been topdressed once, and 40%-50% of the rapeseed has been cultivated and weeded once. In Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan, more than 90% of the more than 500,000 mu of rapeseed fields have been topdressed once, and 30%-50% have been topdressed twice. Various regions have also launched rapeseed field management competitions and strengthened rapeseed field management. The Huidong Production Team of the Huinan People's Commune in Nanhui County, Shanghai, issued a proposal to fraternal communes and teams in the city, putting forward the action slogan of "Thoroughly criticize Rightism, boost morale, work hard this winter and spring, and break through the thousand-jin mark for rapeseed." This team is currently working hard on field management with the spirit of embroidery in field management, striving for safe wintering of rapeseed.

### 冬油菜播种计划超额完成  大部地区追肥锄草保护油菜安全过冬

    冬油菜播种计划超额完成
    大部地区追肥锄草保护油菜安全过冬
    新华社17日讯　全国十九个省（市）区的冬油菜播种计划已经超额完成。今年冬油菜比解放以来任何一年都种得多、种得好。目前绝大部分油菜，叶片浓绿，生长良好。各地人民公社正在积极组织劳力，给油菜追肥、锄草、防治虫害、开沟清沟，培育壮苗，争取安全过冬。
    今年多数地方的油菜是抗旱播种的。在9、10月间，正当油菜播种的时候，许多地方遭受到干旱，严重地影响了播种工作的进行。但是，各地通过贯彻党的八届八中全会决议精神，反右倾、鼓干劲，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，组织大协作、大突击，战胜自然灾害，抗旱抢种完毕。陕西汉中市南海人民公社关爷庙管理区在批判了靠天等雨的思想后，采取灌水、抢犁等办法，突击两天就完成了一千亩油菜播种任务。
    今冬油菜播种的特点是多、快、早、好。各地人民公社在播种之前总结了去年的丰产经验，进一步贯彻了“农业八字宪法”。不论直播或移栽，一般都比去年提早十天到二十天，播种速度加快了50％以上，做到了适期播种。上海、江苏、浙江、湖北、湖南、江西、四川、贵州、云南等九个省、市播种的油菜，深耕五一六寸以上的达到播种面积80％左右，其中约有10％深耕一尺以上。今年各地油菜每亩大多施基肥三千斤至五千斤左右，肥料质量普遍比去年提高。油菜高产区的四川省，今年有60％以上的油菜每亩施肥万斤以上。湖北省的油菜施肥量，一般比去年增加30％—50％。大多数地区都根据具体条件，因地制宜地进一步做到了合理的密植。四川省一般地区由去年每亩植五千至六千株增加到六千至一万株。湖北省一般每亩植一万到二万株。四川省忠县播种质量普遍提高，全县播种的五万多亩油菜，都是胜利油菜良种，深耕八寸以上的面积约占75％，一般每亩下精肥四至五千斤和堆肥一万斤作基肥，密度普遍比去年增加一倍。
    在扩大油菜播种面积的同时，不少地区发动群众利用“十边”等隙地培植“油菜王”，力争多收。目前四川、贵州、江苏、浙江、湖北、湖南等六个省已种十九亿多万株（或窝）油菜王，其中四川省就有十六亿多万窝。
    各地冬油菜普遍比去年同期长得好。据江西、江苏、浙江、上海、湖北、湖南、四川、贵州、云南等九个省、市的油菜分类排队，已经长出六至七片真叶、植株生长茁壮、无病虫、无缺苗的一类苗约占41％；长有四至六片真叶、生长较矮的二类苗约占37％；生长较差的三类苗约占21％。各地在油菜播种结束之后，大都相继转入田间管理。目前，除部分迟种的油菜地还正在查苗补苗外，大部地区正在紧张地追肥、锄草、培土和防治病虫害。据四川、湖北、江苏、上海等十个省、市不完全统计，到本月上旬已有50％—60％，的油菜追过一次肥，40％—50％的油菜中耕除草一次。四川南充专区的五十多万亩油菜田，追肥一次的已达90％以上，追过二次肥的达30％—50％。各地还展开油菜田间管理竞赛。加强油菜田间管理工作。上海市南汇县惠南人民公社惠东生产队向全市兄弟社、队发出倡议，提出：“把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，大干特干一冬春，闯过油菜千斤关”的行动口号。这个队目前正以田间管理赛绣花的精神，作好田间管理工作，争取油菜安全过冬。
