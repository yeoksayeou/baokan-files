Anhui Takes Livestock Raising as the Main Approach, Acquiring Fertilizer Through Four Channels

(Our Hefei dispatch, December 4th) Anhui is adopting measures focusing on livestock raising, combining raising, planting, accumulating, and producing to broadly expand fertilizer sources. Since November, over two million people across the province have been engaged in winter fertilizer accumulation activities daily.

The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, summarizing the masses' experiences in fertilizer accumulation over the years, pointed out that fertilizer accumulation must focus on livestock raising, combining raising, planting, accumulating, and producing. This is the fundamental measure for solving the fertilizer problem. Various localities have earnestly implemented the Provincial Committee's instructions, resulting in this year's winter fertilizer accumulation work showing the characteristics of multiple avenues and high quality from the very beginning.

Focusing on livestock raising means raising more livestock and poultry, especially raising more pigs, and accumulating more manure. Pig manure and urine are not only abundant but also highly effective as fertilizer, especially for improving the sandy soil of the Huaibei Plain in Anhui Province. Last year, the Sunyuan Production Team of the Guangwu Commune in Jieshou County accumulated 400,000 dan of livestock and poultry manure, enabling the average wheat yield per mu to reach over 504 jin; this year, the team has raised an average of 1.4 pigs per mu of cultivated land. With the development of pig raising and other livestock and poultry farming, people's communes in various localities are building pigsties, cattle pens, and chicken and duck cages on a large scale, establishing a system for accumulating livestock and poultry manure and urine, ensuring frequent bedding changes to prevent manure and urine from being lost. People's communes in Su County adopted the method of setting quantities, work points, and rewards, assigning the task of accumulating livestock and poultry manure and pig and cattle pen soil to breeders, accumulating 6.46 million dan of farmyard manure in just over ten days.

Planting means planting more green manure. The province has planted over 3.6 million mu of green manure such as red clover, and is currently strengthening management to strive for high yields. This green manure is not only of good quality but also allows for on-site planting and fertilization, saving labor. In addition, various localities are making extensive use of barren slopes, vacant land, and lake beaches to plant perennial green manure.

Accumulating means collecting various rural soil and miscellaneous manure. This is an inexhaustible source of fertilizer. Currently, in addition to continuing to promote the ten-character诀 (诀jué, secrets/formulas) for fertilizer accumulation familiar to the masses ("熏xūn smoke, 烧shāo burn, 挖wā dig, 换huàn exchange, 扫sǎo sweep, 铲chǎn shovel, 沤òu steep/soak, 堆duī pile, 拾shí pick up, 捞lāo scoop"), various localities are also vigorously building field cellars. This not only reduces the labor of transporting fertilizer but also extracts biogas, and the fertilizer produced after fermentation to extract biogas has a higher fertilizing effect than ordinary steeped fertilizer. Currently, over 300,000 people in the Fuyang and Anqing regions are building field cellars every day. By November 19th, they had built over 840,000 cellars, steeping over 300 million dan of fertilizer, and some are already able to extract biogas.

Producing means using indigenous methods to produce chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers. People's communes have universally established indigenous chemical fertilizer plants, using local materials to produce high-quality fertilizers. In the recent twenty days or so, they have produced over 5.38 million dan of indigenous chemical fertilizer. The indigenous chemical fertilizer plants run by people's communes in She County number 2,715, producing over 6,000 dan of indigenous chemical fertilizer and 880 dan of bacterial fertilizer daily. Many commune canteens are also extracting ammonia from flues to make fertilizer.

Currently, various localities have further arranged labor, combining it with various winter production activities, to launch a larger movement of "focusing on livestock raising and attacking fertilizer through four channels."

    安徽以养为主四路取肥
    本报合肥4日电　安徽各地采取以养为主，养、种、积、制四结合的措施，广辟肥源。11月份以来，全省每天有二百多万人开展冬季积肥活动。
    中共安徽省委总结了群众历年来积肥的经验，指出积肥必须以养为主，养、种、积、制四者结合，这是解决肥料问题的根本措施。各地认真执行省委指示，使今年的冬季积肥工作，一开始就出现了门路多、质量高的特点。
    以养为主，就是多养家畜家禽，其中主要是多养猪，多积粪肥。猪粪尿不但数量多而且肥效高，特别是对安徽省淮北平原砂矼地有改良土壤的作用。界首县光武公社孙园生产队去年积家畜家禽粪四十万担，使小麦平均亩产达到五百零四斤多；今年这个队平均每亩耕地已养猪一点四头。随着生猪和其他家畜家禽的发展，各地人民公社都大建猪牛圈、鸡鸭笼，建立了积蓄家畜家禽粪尿的制度，做到了勤垫勤换，不让粪尿流失。宿县各人民公社采取定数量、定工分、定奖励的办法，把积家畜家禽粪尿和猪牛栏肥土的任务包给饲养员，十多天就积聚了厩肥六百四十六万担。
    种，就是多种绿肥。全省已种下红花草等绿肥三百六十多万亩，目前正在加强管理，争取高产多收。这些绿肥不但质量好，而且就地种植就地施肥，节省了劳动力。另外各地还利用荒坡、隙地、湖滩大种多年生绿肥。
    积，就是积攒各种农家土、杂肥。这是取之不尽、用之不竭的肥源。现在全省各地除继续推行群众所熟知的“熏、烧、挖、换、扫、铲、沤、堆、拾、捞”的积肥十字诀以外，并大搞田头窖，这样既可减少运肥的劳力，又可提取沼气，而且经过发酵提取沼气的沤肥比一般的沤肥肥效还要高。现在阜阳、安庆两专区每天都有三十多万人，兴建地头窖，到11月19日，就已建八十四万多个，沤制了三亿多担肥料，有的已经能提取沼气。
    制，就是利用土法制造化学肥料和细菌肥料。各人民公社普遍办了土化肥厂，就地取材，制造优质肥料。最近二十天左右，就已制土化肥五百三十八万多担。歙县各人民公社办的土化肥厂就有二千七百一十五个，日产土化肥六千多担、细菌肥料八百八十担。很多公社食堂还在烟道内取氨制肥。
    目前各地已进一步安排劳动力，结合各项冬季生产活动，掀起更大的“以养为主，四路攻肥”的运动。
