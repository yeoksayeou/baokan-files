Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Electric Dispatch: According to local newspapers, the Zuo Tian Zinc Mine Geological Exploration Team in Bac Thai Province, Vietnam, completed its full-year task for 1960 on November 18th, four hundred and eight days ahead of schedule, achieving a brilliant victory by completing the Three-Year Plan targets ahead of time.

This is the first unit in the North since the restoration of peace to achieve such brilliant results on the production front. This exploration team completed its full-year task for 1959 as early as September 18th this year.

This brilliant record is the result of the victory of enterprise reform. After studying enterprise reform, the leading cadres of this team went deep among the masses, delved into reality, and improved their leadership style. The workers further enhanced their socialist consciousness through study. Under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, one production upsurge after another was continuously launched. During the production process, the workers put forward hundreds of rationalization proposals and inventions to improve technology, greatly increasing labor productivity. For example, the efficiency of twelve workers drilling blasting holes increased from the original thirteen meters per day to twenty-five meters. Machine drilling workers originally set a monthly target of eighty meters, but they increased it to one hundred and twenty-one meters. The working speed of workers building new mine shafts also increased from seventeen meters to thirty-five meters per day. With the concerted efforts of all employees, the team victoriously entered 1960 by September 18th this year.

After winning the 1959 Red Flag, the enthusiasm of all employees was even higher. They immediately launched a new production upsurge, the "Soviet Rocket Race Movement," and decided to complete the full-year work task for 1960 during the fourth quarter.

In order to accomplish this glorious task, the entire team overcame difficulties such as the shortage of raw materials and tools. All cadres, party members, and Youth League members played exemplary leading roles everywhere. Workers repairing machines also fought day and night in shifts to rush repairs on tools and supply them in a timely manner. Under the inspiring slogans of "One day in the fourth quarter is equal to three days in the third quarter" and "Catch up with the advanced, surpass the advanced," encouraging good news from the construction site continued to come out. At 10:00 PM on November 18th, with a burst of explosives, the entire team completed its final blasting, victoriously surpassing 1960. (Attached picture)

    越南一支勘探队掀起“苏联火箭竞赛运动”
    提前四百多天胜利跨越1960年
    新华社河内电　据这里报纸报道：越南北?省佐田锌矿地质勘探队在11月18日提前四百零八天完成了1960年的全年任务，夺取了提前完成三年计划的指标的辉煌成绩。
    这是全北方和平恢复以来在生产战线上创造这样辉煌成绩的第一个单位。这个勘探队在今年9月18日就完成了1959年全年任务。
    这一辉煌纪录是企业改革取得胜利的结果。这个队的领导干部经过企业改革学习以后，深入群众，深入实际，改进了领导作风。工人们通过学习，社会主义觉悟进一步提高。在越南劳动党的领导下，连续地掀起了一个接一个的生产热潮。工人们在生产过程中提出了成百项改进技术的合理化建议和创造发明，使劳动生产率大大提高，如钻爆炸眼的十二名工人每天钻眼效率从原来的十三米提高到二十五米，机钻工人原订每月指标为八十米，结果提高到一百二十一米，修建新矿井的工人每天工作速度也从十七米提高到三十五米。在全体职工的奋战下，到今年9月18日，这个队已胜利跨进了1960年。
    在胜利夺下1959年红旗之后，全体职工的劲头更加高涨，他们紧接着又掀起了一个“苏联火箭竞赛运动”的新的生产热潮，决定在第四季度期间内完成1960年全年工作任务。
    为了完成这个光荣的任务，全队克服了原材料、工具不足的困难，全体干部、党员和团员处处发挥了模范带头作用。修理机器的工人也分班地日夜奋战，赶修工具，及时供应。在“第四季度的一天等于第三季度的三天”、“赶先进、超先进”的战斗口号下，工地上振奋人心的喜讯不断地传出来，到11月18日晚上十时，在一阵炸药的轰鸣下，全队完成了最后一次爆破，胜利地跨越了1960年。（附图片）
