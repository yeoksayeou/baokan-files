　　Hunan, Anhui, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia All Report Good News
    Six Provinces and Autonomous Regions Achieve Industrial Output Value Targets
    The Combination of Large, Medium, and Small Enterprises Works Well; Small-Scale Modern Groups Play a Big Role; Mass Movements Develop Forward
　　Hunan
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 24th: Hunan Province has already exceeded its annual total industrial output value plan by 0.7% one month ahead of schedule; among the main products listed in this year's plan, 54 have also completed their annual output plans more than one month ahead of schedule.
    The main reason that Hunan Province's industrial front has been able to achieve this victory is that, under the leadership of the Party, all the province's workers have united and worked selflessly. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and launch a production increase and conservation campaign, it further encouraged the workers' enthusiasm. In a very short period of time, a new and prosperous atmosphere emerged on the province's industrial front, and production levels continued to rise. Comparing November with July, the output of major products such as steel, iron, coal, and coke generally increased by more than double.
    The achievements made by Hunan Province's industrial production this year further prove the importance of adhering to the Party's policy of taking steel as the key link for overall leap forward and "walking on two legs" in accelerating the process of socialist industrialization. This year, 75% of the pig iron produced in the province was completed by the "small-scale modern groups" enterprises, which were developed on the basis of last year's "small indigenous groups"; the output of small coal mines accounted for about 50% of the coal produced this year; and the coke used for iron smelting in the province this year was also basically produced by indigenous furnaces. With the development of production, the technical level of these small enterprises has continuously improved, the quality has continuously risen, and the cost has continuously decreased. For example, the blast furnace utilization coefficient of the Gaomingxi Iron Plant in Qianyang area has recently averaged around four; the qualified rate of pig iron in the Songbai Iron Plant in Changning has reached 100%, and the cost of each ton of pig iron has dropped to around one hundred yuan, catching up with the level of modern large blast furnaces.
　　Anhui
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 24th: Anhui Province's industrial production has continued to achieve a great victory of overall leap forward this year. The province's annual total industrial output value plan has been overfulfilled one month ahead of schedule; the annual output plans for 36 major products such as steel, iron, coal, blister copper, and cotton cloth have been completed one to three months ahead of schedule. Other economic indicators have also been completed very well. For example, the average qualified rate of pig iron in November has reached 88.95%. The province has also successfully trial-produced many new products this year.
    This year, the Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province have continuously struggled against right-leaning thinking and continued to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and a series of "walking on two legs" policies in industrial production. The "small-scale modern groups" established in last year's large-scale steelmaking campaign have played a huge role in steel production. The output of small blast furnaces accounted for more than 60% of the pig iron produced in the province this year. Departments such as coal, machinery, chemicals, cement, and light industry have also further promoted the combination of large, medium, and small enterprises and the development of "small-scale modern groups" this year, promoting the high-speed development of production.
　　Yunnan
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 24th: Yunnan Province has overfulfilled its annual total industrial output value plan thirty days ahead of schedule; as of the 20th of this month, the completed total industrial output value has exceeded the annual plan by more than 7%. At the same time, the output of 38 major industrial products such as steel, steel products, iron, coke, copper, chemical fertilizers, and cotton cloth has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the annual plan.
    Under the leadership of the Party, hundreds of thousands of workers in Yunnan Province summarized the great achievements and rich experiences of last year's Great Leap Forward at the beginning of this year, and put forward the slogan of "striving to be ahead rather than behind, striving to be early rather than late," and completed the production plan for the first quarter in one go. In the second quarter, the province's industrial front launched a mass campaign to ensure high-quality and high-yield production, focusing on enterprise management and tapping production potential, and the quality and quantity of products have improved by leaps and bounds. After the Party issued the great call to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and practice production increase and conservation, a new upsurge of the production increase and conservation campaign was quickly set off on the province's industrial front, promoting the steady growth of production and achieving an all-round success in industrial production this year.
　　Shaanxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 24th: Shaanxi Province has completed its annual total industrial output value plan forty-three days ahead of schedule. As of the 23rd of this month, the completed total output value has exceeded the annual plan by 18.45%. The output of 54 products such as steel, iron, coal, electricity generation, agricultural machinery, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn in the province has also completed the annual plan and has greatly increased compared with last year. Among them, electricity generation, steel, and pig iron have increased by more than 50% compared with last year, and cotton yarn and cotton cloth have increased by more than 18%.
    This year, Shaanxi Province's industrial sector has vigorously implemented a complete set of policies of "walking on two legs," such as combining industry and agriculture, combining large, medium, and small enterprises, and combining indigenous and modern methods. Last year's large-scale development of small indigenous groups in the steel industry ended Shaanxi Province's lack of iron and steel; this year, in addition to rectifying, consolidating, and improving the indigenous furnace groups, the province has vigorously developed small-scale modern groups and built more than ten modern iron plants. Steel production has also developed from the original indigenous steelmaking method to converter and electric furnace steelmaking. This year, Shaanxi Province adhered to the method of following the mass line in the industrial front and carried out a large-scale mass campaign. After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, factories and mines opposed right-leaning tendencies and boosted morale, and launched a magnificent upsurge of industrial production throughout the province, effectively accelerating the province's early overfulfillment of the plan.
　　Inner Mongolia
    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 24th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region completed its annual total industrial output value plan ahead of schedule at the end of November. As of December 15th, the region's total industrial output value has exceeded the state plan by 11.59%. Thirty major industrial products have completed the annual output plan, of which 18 have increased by 35% to several times compared with last year, such as pig iron, which has increased by 1.75 times. This year, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee resolutely implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies. The production of steel, machinery, and light industries such as textiles has grown rapidly. The commissioning of Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace and the establishment of medium and small-sized steel bases in Hohhot, Baotou, Jining, Chifeng, Ulanhot, and other places have made Inner Mongolia's steel production leap forward. With the development of the steel industry, industries such as coal, machinery, petroleum, dairy products, and textiles have grown rapidly, and various factories have sprung up everywhere. Since last year's Great Leap Forward, many large, medium, and small coal mines have been newly built and expanded in various places. The coal produced this year has increased by 41.06% compared with last year, which not only meets the needs of the region but also supports other regions.
　　Ningxia
    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, December 24th: The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region completed its annual total industrial output value plan for the region ahead of schedule at the end of November, exceeding it by 12.06%; sixteen major products such as raw coal, pig iron, electricity generation, iron ore, crude oil, and refractory bricks have all completed the annual plan ahead of schedule.
    This year, Ningxia's industrial production has achieved a continuous leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. The output of some major products has greatly increased compared with last year. Due to the commissioning of new enterprises, the region has also manufactured a large number of new products that had never been manufactured in the past. The "small indigenous groups" enterprises in various industries are gradually transitioning to "small-scale modern groups." Due to the development of "small-scale modern groups" in the metallurgical sector, more than half of this year's pig iron output was smelted by small blast furnaces. The production of sulfuric acid, paper, and cement also accounts for a certain proportion of modern methods, which has begun to bring about profound changes in Ningxia's backward industrial outlook.
    Ningxia only began large-scale industrial construction after last year's Great Leap Forward and the establishment of the autonomous region, and its original foundation was very weak. However, under the kind care of the Party and the state, the enthusiastic support of fraternal provinces, and the correct leadership of the autonomous region's Party committee, the Hui and Han workers in the region are determined to build their own industry. Since the beginning of the year, they have launched a mass campaign to increase production and conserve resources, and have made great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution. According to incomplete statistics, since this year, the vast number of workers in the region have put forward more than 110,000 rationalization proposals, innovated more than 10,000 technologies, and created, trial-produced, and imitated more than 2,000 kinds of tools and equipment. Therefore, labor productivity has been greatly improved, ensuring the early completion of this year's total industrial output value plan.

　　湖南　安徽　云南　陕西　内蒙古　宁夏齐报喜讯
    六省、区实现工业产值指标
    大中小结合得好小洋群发挥大作用群众运动向前发展
　　湖南
    新华社长沙24日电　湖南省已经提前一个月超额0.7％完成了全年的工业总产值计划；列入今年计划的主要产品中，有五十四种也已经提前一个月以上完成了今年的产量计划。
    湖南省工业战线能够取得这一胜利，主要原因是全省职工在党的领导下，团结一致，忘我劳动的结果。党的八届八中全会发出了反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的伟大号召后，更加鼓舞了职工们的干劲，在很短的时间内，全省工业战线上就出现了一片欣欣向荣的崭新气象，生产水平不断上升。以11月份同7月份比较，钢、铁、煤、焦主要产品产量一般都增长了一倍以上。
    湖南省今年工业生产取得的成就，进一步证明坚持党的以钢为纲全面跃进和“两条腿走路”的方针，对于加速社会主义工业化进程的重要性。今年，全省生产的生铁，有75％是由在去年“小土群”的基础上发展起来的“小洋群”企业完成的；今年生产的煤炭，小煤井的产量占到了50％左右；全省今年炼铁所用的焦炭，也基本上是依靠土炉生产的。随着生产的发展，这些小型企业的技术水平不断提高，质量不断上升，成本不断降低。如黔阳地区高明溪铁厂高炉利用系数，近来平均达到四左右；常宁松柏铁厂的生铁合格率达到100％，每吨生铁的成本已经下降到一百元左右，赶上了现代化大高炉的水平。
　　安徽
    据新华社合肥24日电　安徽省工业生产今年又继续获得了全面跃进的巨大胜利。全省今年的工业总产值计划，已经提前一个月超额完成；钢、铁、煤、粗铜、棉布等三十六种主要产品的年度产量计划，分别提前一个月到三个月完成。其他各项经济指标也完成的很好。如生铁合格率11月份平均已达88.95％。全省今年还试制成功很多新产品。
    安徽省各地党委今年不断同右倾思想作斗争，在工业生产中继续贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线和一系列“两条腿走路”的方针。去年大办钢铁中建立起来的“小洋群”，在钢铁生产中发挥了巨大的作用。全省今年生产的生铁中，小高炉的产量占了60％以上。煤炭、机械、化工、水泥、轻工业等部门，今年也进一步大搞大中小结合，大搞“小洋群”，促进了生产高速度发展。
　　云南
    新华社昆明24日电　云南省提前三十天超额完成了全年工业总产值计划；截至本月20日止，完成的工业总产值已超过年度计划7％以上。同时，全省钢、钢材、铁、焦炭、铜、化肥、棉布等三十八种主要工业产品的产量，已提前超额完成了年度计划。
    云南省数十万职工在党的领导下，今年初总结了去年大跃进的伟大成就和丰富经验，并且提出了“赶前不赶后，赶早不赶晚”的口号，一鼓作气地超额完成了第一季度生产计划。在第二季度，全省工业战线又开展了保证优质高产的群众运动，大抓企业管理，大挖生产潜力，产品质量和数量有了突飞猛进的提高。党的反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的伟大号召发出之后，全省工业战线上又迅速掀起了增产节约运动的新高潮，促使生产蒸蒸日上，实现了今年工业生产满堂红。
　　陕西
    据新华社西安24日电　陕西省提前四十三天完成了全年工业总产值计划。到本月23日止，完成的总产值已超过年度计划18.45％。全省钢、铁、煤、发电量、农业机械、棉布、棉纱等五十四种产品的产量，也都完成了全年计划，并且比去年有很大增长。其中，发电量、钢、生铁比去年增长50％以上，棉纱和棉布增长18％以上。
    陕西省工业部门今年大力贯彻了工农业并举、大中小并举、土洋并举等一整套两条腿走路的方针。钢铁工业去年大搞小土群，结束了陕西省手无寸铁的局面；今年，全省除了整顿、巩固提高土炉群以外，大搞小洋群，建设起十多个洋铁厂。钢的生产也由原来的土法炼钢发展成转炉和电炉炼钢。今年，陕西省在工业战线上坚持贯彻群众路线的方法，开展了大规模的群众运动。党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，各厂矿企业反右倾、鼓干劲，在全省范围内掀起了波澜壮阔的工业生产高潮，有力地加快了全省提前超额完成计划。
　　内蒙古
    新华社呼和浩特24日电　内蒙古自治区于11月底提前完成了今年工业总产值计划。到12月15日为止，全区工业总产值已超过国家计划11.59％。有三十种主要工业产品完成了全年产量计划，其中比去年增产35％到几倍的有18种，其中如生铁就增长一点七五倍。内蒙古党委今年坚决贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针。钢铁、机械以及纺织等轻工业生产，都增长很快。包钢一号高炉投入生产，和呼和浩特、包头、集宁、赤峰、乌兰浩特等地中、小型钢铁基地的建立，使得内蒙古的钢铁生产飞跃上升。随着钢铁工业发展，煤炭、机械、石油和乳品、纺织等工业迅速成长，各种工厂遍地开花。各地从去年大跃进以来，新建、扩建了许多大中小煤矿，今年生产的煤炭，比去年增加41.06％，不仅满足了本区需要，还支援了外地。
　　宁夏
    新华社银川24日电　宁夏回族自治区在11月底，超额12.06％提前完成了今年全区工业总产值计划；原煤、生铁、发电量、铁矿石、原油、耐火砖等十六种主要产品，都分别提前完成了全年计划。
    今年，宁夏地区的工业生产在去年大跃进的基础上，实现了继续跃进。一些主要产品的产量，都比去年有很大的增长。由于新建企业的投入生产，全区还制造了大批过去从未制造过的新产品。各行业的“小土群”企业正在逐步向“小洋群”过渡。冶金部门由于发展了“小洋群”，今年的生铁产量就有一半以上是由小高炉炼出来的。硫酸、纸、水泥的生产中洋法生产也占有一定比重。这就使宁夏工业落后的面貌开始发生深刻的变化。
    宁夏在去年大跃进和自治区成立之后，才开始大规模的工业建设，原来的基础十分薄弱。但是全区回、汉族职工在党和国家的亲切关怀下，在各兄弟省的热情支援和自治区党委的正确领导下，决心建设自己的工业。他们从年初开始就开展了群众性的增产节约运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命。据不完全统计，今年以来，全区广大职工已经提出了十一万多件合理化建议，革新技术一万多项，创制、试制、仿制工具和设备二千多种。因此大大提高了劳动生产率，保证了今年工业总产值计划的提前完成。
