Fuzhou, December 15th (From our newspaper) Cadres at all levels in Lianjiang, Yongtai, Ningde, and other counties in Fujian Province are vigorously developing pig raising "experimental fields," pushing the mass pig raising movement to a new high.

Cadres from various departments at the county level in Lianjiang County, under the direct leadership of the County Party Committee, are establishing a large-scale comprehensive pig farm as a pig raising "experimental field." They are organizing cadres from various departments directly under the county to work here and study the experience of solving problems such as feed, piglets, and pigsties to promote the county's pig raising movement. Each commune and brigade in the county has also established one or two pig raising "experimental fields," with commune and brigade cadres taking turns working in the fields for a period of two to four months. Currently, more than 3,000 cadres in the county have been drawn to participate in the work of pig raising "experimental fields." In the hundred days from early August to mid-November, the total number of pigs raised in the county increased sharply from the original 39,290 to 82,377, more than doubling. In Yongtai County, 438 county, commune, and brigade cadres, under the slogan of "First be a good feeder, then be a commander; be a feeder and a commander at the same time," worked alongside commune members in pig farms, feeding, researching, and solving problems together. In twenty days, the collective pig raising in the county increased by more than double, and the number of collective pig farms increased from the original 48 to 506. In order to realize the leap forward plan of one pig per person by next year, Ningde County has sent more than 1,100 Party members, League members, and cadres to pig farms to work as feeding and management personnel.

In the movement of cadres at all levels vigorously developing pig raising "experimental fields," the experience of leading pig raising has been continuously increasing, and pig raising technology has been continuously improving. Li Taosheng, the first secretary of the Guantou Commune Party Committee in Lianjiang County, went deep into the Tangxia Brigade to develop pig raising "experimental fields." After summarizing a set of collective pig raising experiences, he immediately promoted it to all production teams in the commune. In just one month, the number of collectively raised pigs increased from the original 2,120 to 4,701. In order to ensure that the piglets could keep up with the needs of the great development of pig raising, Yang Wenchao, the captain of Tangxia Brigade, and the commune members studied together and adopted methods such as heavy mating, re-mating, and transferring piglets to foster mothers, creating the experience of producing 16 to 23 piglets per litter, and ensuring that all sows in the team were pregnant.

After cadres at all levels participated in pig raising and led pig raising, the idea of some people underestimating pig raising work was quickly changed, the sense of honor of the feeders was strengthened, and an example was set for mass pig raising. Chen Wendu, the captain of the Mingdeng Brigade of Wutong Commune in Yongtai County, got up early and stayed up late every day to do a good job in pig raising in the pig farm. Under his encouragement, the commune members who were originally not at ease in doing feeding work were all at ease. Due to the careful feeding by cadres and feeders, the weight gain of each fat pig increased from the original half a catty per day to more than one catty.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing. Leading cadres at all levels in Changshou County, a suburb of Chongqing, have recently been carrying their luggage to pig farms to work as feeders, participating in pig raising, and leading pig raising, giving the pig farms a new look. A trend of the whole Party and the whole people paying attention to pig raising has formed in the county, changing the phenomenon of high mortality and weakness of pigs after winter in previous years.

Changshou County, which has eleven people's communes, one hundred and forty-five management areas, and six hundred and eighty-four production brigades, has recently sent a total of more than 1,000 cadres to pig farms, including more than 100 cadres from county-level organs and commune Party committee secretaries.

The pigs in the people's communes of Changshou County have developed greatly this year. At present, the total number of pigs has increased by 80% compared with the end of last year. Recently, the County Party Committee and the Party Committees of the People's Communes seriously analyzed the current pig raising situation, and believed that the current period is the peak season for farrowing and an important period for winter mating; it is also a critical period for doing a good job in preventing cold weather and preventing and controlling diseases. Therefore, it was decided that the county, commune, management area, and brigade would all send cadres to pig farms to strengthen the leadership of pig raising work.

After cadres at all levels went to the breeding farms, they first strengthened the political and ideological work of the breeders, so that the breeders further realized the great significance of the pig breeding undertaking. After Yu Houben, secretary of the Party branch of the 15th Management District of Shuanglong Commune, arrived at the pig farm of the 3rd Brigade, he found that some breeders did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of breeding work, so he launched a debate among the breeders on "Why raise pigs? What are the benefits of raising pigs? Can we raise pigs well? How to raise pigs well?" Through the debate, the breeders' political awareness was greatly improved, and the work was immediately transformed.

After cadres at all levels went to the pig farm, they promptly discovered and solved many problems in feeding. After Liang Zhaolin, secretary of the Xinglong Commune Party Committee, and Wang Zhiyu, director of the Party Committee Office, arrived at the Wangjiawan breeding farm, they found that the breeding farm did not have a clear feeding management system and the work was relatively chaotic. They discussed and discussed with the breeders and formulated a "seven fixings," "three guarantees," and "two rewards" feeding management system to make the breeding farm work in an orderly manner and have a new look. The Longxi Commune Stud Farm originally stipulated that each pig should have 18 to 20 catties of green fodder and half a catty to one catty of refined fodder per day. After the commune cadres arrived at the stud farm, they found that this was sometimes not done. They immediately studied and established a fodder use and registration system with the masses, so that various regulations were seriously implemented, and all three types of pigs in the farm were upgraded.

After the cadres went to the pig farm, they humbly learned technology from the masses, and many people were able to simultaneously serve as "five personnel": feeders, veterinary epidemic prevention personnel, castrators, artificial insemination personnel, and piglet delivery personnel.

    长寿县一千多名干部到养猪场当饲养员
    本报福州15日电　福建省连江、永泰、宁德等县各级干部大搞养猪“试验田”，把全民养猪运动推向新的高潮。
    连江县县一级各部门的干部在县委会直接领导下，正在建立一个大型综合养猪场，作为养猪“试验田”，组织县直属机关各部门干部在这里劳动，并研究解决饲料、猪苗、猪舍等问题的经验，推动全县养猪运动。这个县的各公社、大队也分别办起一个到二个养猪“试验场”，社队干部以二个月到四个月为一期轮流下场养猪。目前全县已抽出三千多干部参加养猪“试验田”的工作。全县从8月上旬到11月中旬的一百天中，养猪总头数由原来三万九千二百九十头发展到八万二千三百七十七头，激增一倍多。永泰县四百三十八个县、社、队干部在“先当好饲养员、再当司令员，一面当饲养员，一面当司令员”的口号下，在养猪场和社员们一起边饲养、边研究、边解决问题，二十天中，全县集体养猪增长一倍多，集体养猪场由原来四十八个增加到五百零六个。宁德县为提前实现明年一人一头猪的跃进规划，有一千一百多名党团员和干部到养猪场当饲养管理人员。
    各级干部在大搞养猪“试验田”运动中，领导养猪的经验不断增多，养猪技术不断提高。连江县琯头公社党委第一书记李逃盛深入塘下大队搞养猪“试验田”后，总结了一套集体养猪经验，立即向全社各生产队推广，仅一个月，集体养猪从原来二千一百二十头增加到四千七百零一头。该社塘下大队队长杨文潮为了使猪苗能够赶上养猪大发展的需要，他和社员一起研究，采取母猪重配、复配、移苗寄母等办法，创造了一胎产十六头到二十三头小猪的经验，并作到全队母猪满怀。
    在各级干部参加养猪、领导养猪以后，迅速改变了一些人轻视养猪工作的思想，加强了饲养员的光荣感，为全民养猪树立了榜样。永泰县梧桐公社明灯大队队长陈文肚每天起早带晚在养猪场内搞好养猪工作，在他的鼓舞下，原来不安心做饲养工作的社员都安了心。由于干部和饲养员一起细心喂养，使每头肥猪由原来每天长膘半斤提高到一斤以上。
    据新华社讯　重庆市郊长寿县的各级领导干部最近纷纷背着行李到生猪饲养场当饲养员，参加养猪，领导养猪，使各个饲养场面貌一新。全县形成了全党全民重视养猪事业的风气，改变了历年来生猪入冬后死亡多、瘦弱多的现象。
    有十一个人民公社、一百四十五个管理区、六百八十四个生产大队的长寿县，最近已经下到养猪场的干部共有一千多人，其中包括县一级机关干部和公社党委书记等干部一百多人。
    长寿县各人民公社的猪今年有很大发展，目前，猪的总头数比去年年底增加了80％。最近，县委和各人民公社党委认真分析了当前的养猪情况，认为当前是产仔旺季和冬配的重要时期；又是作好猪的防寒过冬、防治疫病的关键时期，因此，决定县、社、管理区、大队都抽出干部下到养猪场，加强养猪工作领导。
    各级干部下到饲养场后，首先加强了对饲养员的政治思想工作，使饲养员进一步认识到养猪事业的重大意义。双龙公社十五管理区党支部书记余厚本到第三大队猪场后，发现有些饲养员对饲养工作的意义认识不足，就发动饲养员展开“为什么要养猪？养猪有哪些好处？能不能养好猪？怎么养好猪？”的辩论，通过辩论，大大提高了饲养员的政治觉悟，工作即时有了转变。
    各级干部到养猪场后，及时发现和解决了饲养中的许多问题。兴隆公社党委书记梁兆林和党委办公室主任王志禹到王家湾饲养场后，发现这个饲养场没有明确的饲养管理制度，工作比较混乱，就和饲养员们一起研究讨论，订出了“七定”、“三包”、“两奖”的饲养管理制度，使饲养场工作有条不紊，面貌一新。龙溪公社种猪场原规定每头猪每天有十八斤到二十斤青饲料、半斤到一斤精饲料，公社干部到种猪场以后，发现有时没有做到，他们立即和群众研究建立了饲料使用、登记制度，使各项规定得到认真贯彻，全场三类猪全部升了级。
    干部们下到养猪场后，虚心向群众学习技术，不少人已能同时担任饲养员、兽疫防治员、阉割员、人工授精员、小猪接生员的“五员”工作了。（附图片）
