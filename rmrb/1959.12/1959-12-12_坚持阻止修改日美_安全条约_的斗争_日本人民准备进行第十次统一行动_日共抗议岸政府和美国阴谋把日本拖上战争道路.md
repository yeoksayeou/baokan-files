Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th Dispatch: The National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in Japan decided today that it and its local organizations will hold rallies and demonstrations on the Tenth Unified Action Day (December 22nd) to demand a halt to negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" and to protest the Kishida Nobusuke government's suppression of the movement against the "Security Treaty." The rallies and demonstrations will also oppose the enactment of laws prohibiting public demonstrations around the Diet.

The representative of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) said at today's meeting that the workers of Sohyo firmly oppose the enactment of laws prohibiting demonstrations around the Diet. He said that Sohyo workers are prepared to wage a large-scale struggle to oppose any attempt to realize this plan.

The National Council also decided on detailed plans for holding a national anti-"Security Treaty" convention. The convention, scheduled for December 16th, will hear a report on the Supreme Court's ruling on the "Sunagawa Incident." It is expected that the verdict will be announced on that day. Bicycle and motorcycle processions will come from various prefectures in the Kanto region to participate in the national convention.

The National Council also decided that representatives of the National Councils Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" from all over the country will hold a meeting on December 24th to formulate an action plan to prevent Kishida Nobusuke from visiting the United States in January next year and to summarize the achievements of this year's anti-"Security Treaty" movement.

Representatives of the National Council also went to the Metropolitan Police Department to protest the police's arrest of some activists of the worker, farmer, and student movements yesterday and today, and the summoning of trade union leaders.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) submitted protest letters to the Kishida Nobusuke government and U.S. President Eisenhower on the 10th, demanding the immediate cessation of the U.S.-Japan negotiations on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The protest letter to the Kishida Nobusuke government pointed out that the Japanese people's anxiety and indignation towards the Kishida Nobusuke government's collusion with the U.S. government in persisting in the conspiracy to forcibly revise the "Security Treaty" is growing daily.

The protest letter pointed out that revising the "Security Treaty" will not only make Japan even more subordinate to the U.S. military alliance, trample on the Japanese Constitution, open the way for Japan to send troops abroad, and rapidly expand Japan's military preparations, but will also promote the militarization of Japan's politics, economy, and education, and intensify the destruction of democracy and the people's livelihood. At the same time, this is running counter to the world trend of peaceful coexistence and the easing of international tensions, strengthening the policy of hostility towards China and the Soviet Union, and promoting an anti-national conspiracy to lead Japan onto the path of war.

The Japanese Communist Party strongly protests against the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet for implementing this traitorous policy, and at the same time demands the immediate cessation of the U.S.-Japan negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty," and demands the immediate cessation of the Kishida Nobusuke-led government delegation's plan to go to the United States to sign a new treaty.

The protest letter seriously protests against the Kishida Nobusuke government's wanton and illegal suppression of the people participating in the Eighth National Unified Action, and demands that it immediately cease the formulation of laws restricting demonstrations near the Diet and the conspiracy to punish Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō, etc.

The JCP also protested against the Kishida Nobusuke government and the ruling party's attempt to extend the Diet session, and pointed out that this conspiracy is contrary to the will of the Japanese people and attempts to forcibly pass laws restricting demonstrations, approve the war reparations agreement illegally signed with South Vietnam, and open the way for revising the "Security Treaty." The JCP demanded that the government withdraw its plan to extend the Diet session.

Japanese Communist Party representatives Shiga Yoshio and Murakami Yu and others delivered the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party's protest letter to Eisenhower to the U.S. Embassy in Japan, condemning Eisenhower and MacArthur II for making statements one after another, blatantly supporting and urging the Kishida Nobusuke government to complete the revision of the "Security Treaty" as soon as possible, and slandering and intimidating Japanese public opinion advocating a neutral policy. The protest letter emphasized that the Japanese people can no longer tolerate Japan being in a state of subordination to the United States, and firmly refuse to be the U.S.'s lackeys and accomplices in its war policy.

The Japanese Communist Party strongly demands that the U.S. government promptly cease the U.S.-Japan negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty," withdraw its troops from all over Japan, and abolish its bases, and promptly return Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan.

    坚持阻止修改日美“安全条约”的斗争
    日本人民准备进行第十次统一行动
    日共抗议岸政府和美国阴谋把日本拖上战争道路
    据新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天决定，它和它的地方组织都将在第十次统一行动日（12月22日）举行集会和示威游行，要求停止关于修改“安全条约”的谈判，以及抗议岸信介政府镇压反对“安全条约”的运动，集会和示威游行还将反对制定禁止公众在国会周围游行示威的法律。
    日本工会总评议会的代表在今天的会议上说，总评议会的工人坚决反对制定禁止在国会周围举行示威游行的法律。他说，总评议会的工人准备进行大规模的斗争来反对想实现这种计划的任何企图。
    国民会议还决定了关于举行全国反对“安全条约”大会的详细计划。预定于12月16日举行的这个大会将听取关于最高裁判所就“砂川事件”作出的判决的报告，预料在那一天将要宣布判决。自行车和摩托车游行队伍将从关东地区的各县前来参加全国大会。
    国民会议还决定，全国各地阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议的代表将在12月24日举行会议，来制定阻止岸信介明年1月访问美国的行动计划和总结今年展开反对“安全条约”运动的成就。
    国民会议的代表还到警视厅，抗议警察在昨天和今天逮捕工人、农民和学生运动的一些积极分子和传讯工会领导人。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会10日分别向岸信介政府和美国总统艾森豪威尔提出抗议书，要求立即停止修改日美“安全条约”的日美谈判。
    向岸信介政府提出的抗议书指出，日本人民对岸信介政府勾结美国政府坚持强行修改“安全条约”的阴谋所表示的不安和激愤情绪，正在日益增长。
    抗议书指出，修改“安全条约”不仅将使日本更加从属于美国的军事同盟，蹂躏日本宪法，为日本派兵出国打开道路，迅速扩充日本的军备，而且将促使日本政治、经济、教育的军国主义化，加剧破坏民主和国民生活。同时，这是同和平共处、国际紧张局势趋向缓和的世界潮流背道而驰的，加强敌视中国和苏联的政策、促使日本走上战争道路的反民族的阴谋。
    日本共产党强烈抗议岸信介内阁执行这种卖国政策，同时要求立即停止修改“安全条约”的日美谈判，要求立即停止以岸信介为首的政府代表团去美国签订新条约的计划。
    抗议书严重抗议岸信介政府对参加第八次全国统一行动的人民横加非法镇压，并且要求它立即停止制订限制在国会附近举行示威游行的法律和处罚社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎等阴谋。
    日共还抗议岸信介政府和执政党企图延长国会会期，并且指出，这个阴谋是违背日本人民的意志，企图强行通过限制示威游行的法律、批准同南越非法签订的战争赔偿协定和给修改“安全条约”打开道路。日共要求政府撤销延长国会会期的计划。
    日本共产党代表志贺义雄和村上由等人向美国驻日本大使馆递交的日本共产党中央委员会给艾森豪威尔的抗议书，谴责艾森豪威尔和麦克阿瑟第二先后发表谈话，露骨地支援和催促岸信介政府赶紧完成修改“安全条约”工作，并对日本主张采取中立政策的舆论进行诬蔑和恫吓。抗议书强调指出，日本人民已不能再忍受日本处于从属于美国的状态，并且坚决拒绝做美国的走狗和战争政策的共谋者。
    日本共产党强烈要求美国政府尽速停止修改“安全条约”的日美谈判，从日本全境撤出军队和撤销基地，尽速把冲绳岛和小笠原群岛归还给日本。
