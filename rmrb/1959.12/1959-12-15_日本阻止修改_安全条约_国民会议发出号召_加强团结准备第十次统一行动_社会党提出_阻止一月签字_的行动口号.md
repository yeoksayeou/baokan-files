Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 14th: The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" today requested its prefectural and local branches to prepare to hold local gatherings as the main form of expressing public sentiment for the tenth nationwide unified action against revising the "Security Treaty," scheduled for December 22nd. It called on branches to oppose the Kishida Nobusuke government's measures to suppress the anti-"Security Treaty" movement and to oppose the conspiracy to draft laws prohibiting mass demonstrations near the Diet.

The National Conference made these requests in an appeal issued today.

The appeal stated that despite the powerful demonstrations held by the Japanese people in the eighth and ninth national unified actions against revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the government still insists on signing the treaty in mid-January and has already organized a government delegation to the United States to sign it. The U.S. government has also claimed its support for the Japanese government's attempt to sign the treaty as soon as possible.

The appeal pointed out that the situation is becoming increasingly urgent.

The appeal called on the lower-level organizations of the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to meet the decisive stage of the struggle against the "Security Treaty" with stronger unity in the upcoming tenth national unified action.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 12th: The Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party decided on the 11th to hold the tenth unified action against revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" on December 22nd, with the central slogan of "Prevent Signing in January."

After analyzing the current situation, the Central Executive Committee meeting pointed out that millions of people have already joined the struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." At the same time, Japanese cultural figures have also taken action, and this mass movement is increasingly reaching a climax. The meeting also pointed out that powerful figures within the Liberal Democratic Party also hold different views from Nobusuke Kishida on the issue of revising the "Security Treaty." The Socialist Party believes that future developments depend on how to set off a broader mass movement and a climax of parliamentary struggle.

The future struggle plan determined by the meeting stipulates: if Nobusuke Kishida, despite the opposition of the Japanese people, goes to the United States on January 16th next year to sign the new "Security Treaty," a larger-scale struggle will be launched, unified protest actions will be launched, and protest rallies will be held in cities, towns, and villages throughout the country.

The plan also stipulates: the day that the Kishida Nobusuke government signs a new military alliance treaty with the United States will be designated as "National Day of Anger," and various opposition actions will be launched simultaneously across the country; from early February to early April, upsurge conferences to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" will be held in all villages and towns, and a national march to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" will be organized in March; if the Kishida Nobusuke group forcibly deliberates the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the Diet, the Socialist Party will organize powerful strikes by workers and mobilize people from all walks of life, including farmers, youth, women, and cultural figures, to take powerful unified action.

The meeting also decided to hold mass rallies in Tokyo and other places on December 16th, the day the Supreme Court pronounces judgment on the "Sunagawa Incident" against the U.S. military base, to support the fair judgment made by the Tokyo District Court in March this year, which declared that the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan and the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" violated the Japanese Constitution and acquitted the defendants in the "Sunagawa Incident."

    日本阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议发出号召
    加强团结准备第十次统一行动
    社会党提出“阻止一月签字”的行动口号
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天要求它的县和地方的各分会准备举行地方性的集会，以作为定于12月22日举行的第十次反对修改“安全条约”全国统一行动的表示公众情绪的主要形式。它号召各分会反对岸信介政府镇压反对“安全条约”运动的措施，反对拟订禁止在国会附近举行群众示威游行的法律的阴谋。
    国民会议是在今天发表的一项呼吁书中提出这些要求的。
    呼吁书说，尽管日本人民在第八次和第九次全国统一行动中举行了反对修改日美“安全条约”的强有力的示威，但是政府还是坚持要在1月中旬签订这个条约，并且已经在组织到美国去签订这个条约的政府代表团。美国政府也声称支持日本政府早日签订这个条约的企图。
    呼吁书指出，现在局势是变得愈来愈紧迫了。
    呼吁书号召阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议的较低各级组织在即将举行的第十次全国统一行动中，要以更强有力的团结来迎接反对“安全条约”斗争的决定性阶段。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会11日决定，以“阻止1月签字”为中心口号在12月22日举行反对修改日美“安全条约”第十次统一行动。
    中央执行委员会会议在分析了目前的形势后指出，几百万群众已经投入阻止修改日美“安全条约”的斗争中，同时，日本的文化界人士也行动起来，这一群众运动正在日益走向高潮。会议还指出，自由民主党内的有力人士也在修改“安全条约”问题上同岸信介抱有不同意见。社会党认为，今后的形势发展取决于如何掀起更广泛的群众运动和国会斗争的高潮。
    会议确定的今后斗争计划规定：如果岸信介不顾日本人民反对在明年1月16日前往美国签订新的“安全条约”，将发起更大规模的斗争，展开抗议的统一行动，并且在全国各市、镇、村举行抗议集会。
    这项计划还规定：把岸信介政府同美国签订新的军事同盟条约那天作为“国民愤怒之日”，在全国各地一齐展开各种各样的反对行动；从2月初到4月上旬，将在所有村、镇举行阻止修改“安全条约”的奋起大会，并且在3月里组织一个阻止修改“安全条约”的国民大游行；如果岸信介集团在国会里强行审议新的日美“安全条约”，社会党将组织工人举行强有力的罢工，动员农民、青年、妇女、文化界人士等各阶层人民共同采取强有力的统一行动。
    会议还决定在12月16日最高裁判所对反对美军基地的“砂川事件”进行宣判的当天，在东京和各地举行群众集会，支持东京地方裁判所在今年3月宣布的美军驻扎日本和日美“安全条约”违反日本宪法和宣判“砂川事件”被告无罪的公正判决。
