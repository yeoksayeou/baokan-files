    The Hero and Poet of Bulgaria's Anti-Fascist Struggle
    —In Commemoration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of Vaptsarov's Birth
    Ge Baoquan
    December 7th of this year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Nikola Vaptsarov, the heroic fighter in the Bulgarian people's anti-fascist struggle and the outstanding revolutionary poet. During the heroic anti-fascist struggle waged by the Bulgarian people around the time of the outbreak of World War II, Vaptsarov was always an unyielding and glorious banner. His poems, full of revolutionary passion and beloved by the broad masses of the people, will forever occupy a most glorious place in the history of the development of revolutionary poetry in Bulgaria. Today, the immortal name of Vaptsarov lives not only in the hearts of all the Bulgarian people, but also in the hearts of millions of progressive people and peace-loving people all over the world!
    We know that Bulgarian people's poetry has a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle. This tradition, like a red thread, runs through the folk songs of the Haiduts (guerrillas) against Turkish enslavement, and also through the poetry of the three great revolutionary poets of Bulgaria since the nineteenth century—Hristo Botev, Hristo Smirnenski, and Nikola Vaptsarov. Vulko Chervenkov, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria, once said of these three great revolutionary poets: "Smirnenski and Vaptsarov—these are the highest points reached by Bulgarian revolutionary poetry after Hristo Botev."
    Nikola Vaptsarov was the heir to the revolutionary poetry traditions of Botev and Smirnenski, and he succeeded them in raising Bulgarian revolutionary poetry to a newer and higher stage. The era in which Vaptsarov lived and created was the era after the failure of the Bulgarian people's armed uprising in September 1923 and around the outbreak of World War II, which made him a heroic fighter and great singer in the Bulgarian people's anti-fascist struggle. Unfortunately, Vaptsarov, like Botev and Smirnenski, died in the prime of his life and poetic creation; but like them, he devoted his life to the revolutionary cause, and with his heroic revolutionary struggle and passionate poetry, he wrote the most brilliant pages in the history of the Bulgarian people's revolutionary struggle and the development of revolutionary poetry!
    Nikola Vaptsarov was born on December 7, 1909, in the town of Bansko in the Pirin Mountains of southwestern Bulgaria, into a family of Macedonian revolutionaries. His mother was a knowledgeable and cultured woman who, from childhood, taught Vaptsarov to recite the revolutionary poems of Botev and Vazov, and also cultivated in him a love for the motherland, the people, freedom, and labor. In 1926, Vaptsarov entered the Naval Mechanical School in Varna. During his time as a student and intern, he first came into contact with revolutionary sailors and was influenced by communist ideas. After graduating from the Naval Mechanical School, he faced the problem of unemployment. In order to solve his livelihood problems, he had to work as a stoker in paper mills and locomotives, and as a mechanic in waste recycling plants, which made it possible for him to have close contact with the working people and determined him to fight for the cause of proletarian liberation. Thus, he joined the ranks of the Bulgarian Workers' Party and devoted himself to the cause of the Bulgarian people's revolutionary struggle.
    Vaptsarov had already begun writing during his middle school years, and his poems published while he was living in Sofia were well received and recognized by society. In 1940, his first and only collection of poems, "Motor Songs," was published, which immediately established his immortal status in Bulgarian revolutionary poetry. The first poem in this collection, "Belief," is the only poem that was not censored. Here, Vaptsarov powerfully expressed the indestructible belief of a revolutionary poet and fighter:
          Perhaps you want
          to destroy
          my belief
          in happy days;
          my belief that tomorrow
          life will be better,
          life will be more meaningful?
          May I ask, how will you attack it?
          With bullets?
          No! It's no use!
          Go to hell!—Don't waste your efforts!
          Its chest
          is clad in strong armor,
          the armor-piercing shells
          to attack it
          have not yet been invented!
          Have not yet been invented!
    In poems such as "Factory," "Memories," and "We Will Build Factories" in this collection, Vaptsarov wrote about the tragic and unfortunate fate of the Bulgarian working class, and their heroic struggle; in poems such as "Motherland" and "Land," he wrote about his love for the motherland; and in the series of poems "About a Certain Country," he wrote about his boundless sympathy for the fighting Spanish people. More importantly, in his poems, he used the yearning for a bright future and the belief in the inevitable victory of the revolutionary cause and the communist cause to inspire and encourage the Bulgarian people.
    Around the time of the outbreak of World War II, as the fascist threat grew increasingly serious, Vaptsarov used his position as editor of the "Literary Criticism" newspaper to unite many progressive writers to jointly fight against fascism. On June 22, 1941, German fascists perfidiously attacked the Soviet Union. The pro-fascist government of Bulgaria betrayed the interests of the motherland and turned its territory into a military base for German fascist bandits. At this time, Vaptsarov, as a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Workers' Party, participated in the Central Military Commission and devoted all his energy to underground secret revolutionary work. He went to Varna to establish secret contact with the Soviet Union; at the same time, he led armed struggles and various sabotage and explosive operations in various places. Vaptsarov, as a poet, suddenly became a heroic fighter; he wrote about his feelings in an unfinished poem at that time ("No, Now Is Not the Time to Write Poetry"). On the morning of March 4, 1942, Vaptsarov was unfortunately arrested and suffered all kinds of torture in the police station, but as he said in the poem "Belief," all attempts to destroy his strong beliefs and will were in vain. On July 6, the military court held a trial. Vaptsarov made a heroic defense in court and spoke with great fearlessness: "Gentlemen judges, ... my activities ... are precisely against the German troops in our country, against the fascists and their Bulgarian accomplices. I am acting with clear consciousness, that is, to fight for the freedom of my motherland. You can judge my activities as you wish. ... I fight for the happiness of my motherland and am prepared to die for it!" On July 23, Vaptsarov was sentenced to death. He and several other anti-fascist revolutionary comrades were shot in the tunnel of the military shooting range. He was only thirty-three years old when he died. He and his comrades heroically and calmly went to their deaths together, singing the famous lines of Botev's "He who falls in the fight for freedom does not die." His death was glorious, in his own words:
        I clearly know
        my place in life,
        I will never
        contribute my life in vain.
        I want to die sincerely
        as a worker,
        to die in our
        struggle for bread and freedom!
    Although Vaptsarov died, his spirit did not die! The World Peace Council, in high respect for this anti-fascist fighter and defender of peace, decided in June 1953 to posthumously award him the honorary award of the 1952 International Peace Prize. For the Chinese people, Vaptsarov is a very familiar name, and his poems full of revolutionary passion are widely recited by our readers today.
    Vaptsarov has not died! He is always with us! We will always remember these lines of poetry he wrote before his martyrdom:
        The struggle is ruthless and cruel.
        The struggle, as people say, is like an epic.
        I have fallen. ...
        But in the storm, we are still with you ...
                  December 6, 1959, in Beijing

    保加利亚反法西斯斗争的英雄和诗人
    ——为纪念瓦普察洛夫诞生五十周年而作
    戈宝权
    今年的12月7日，是保加利亚人民反法西斯斗争中的英勇战士和杰出的革命诗人尼古拉·瓦普察洛夫诞生的五十周年。在第二次世界大战爆发前后保加利亚人民所进行的反法西斯的英勇斗争中，瓦普察洛夫始终是一面不屈不挠的光辉的旗帜。他的为广大人民所热爱的充满革命激情的诗歌作品，在保加利亚人民的革命诗歌的发展史上，也永远占着一个最光荣的地位。在今天，瓦普察洛夫这个永垂不朽的名字，不仅仅活在全保加利亚人民的心中，同时也活在全世界千千万万的进步人士和热爱和平的人们的心中！
    我们知道，保加利亚人民的诗歌，是有着光辉的革命斗争传统的。这个传统，正像一条红线似地，贯穿在保加利亚人民反对土耳其人奴役统治的民歌——海杜特（游击队）的歌声当中，也贯穿在十九世纪以来保加利亚的三大革命诗人——赫里斯多·保泰夫、赫里斯多·斯米尔宁斯基和尼古拉·瓦普察洛夫的诗歌作品当中。保共中央政治局委员、保加利亚部长会议副主席伏尔科·契尔文科夫曾经这样讲起这三大革命诗人：“斯米尔宁斯基和瓦普察洛夫——这是在赫里斯多·保泰夫之后保加利亚的革命诗歌所达到的最高点。”
    尼古拉·瓦普察洛夫是保泰夫和斯米尔宁斯基的革命诗歌传统的继承者，他继他们之后把保加利亚的革命诗歌提到了更新和更高的阶段。瓦普察洛夫生活和创作的时代，是在1923年9月保加利亚人民武装起义失败之后和第二次世界大战爆发前后的时代，这就使得他成为保加利亚人民反法西斯斗争中的英勇战士和伟大歌手，不幸的，是瓦普察洛夫也正像保泰夫和斯米尔宁斯基一样，死在他的生活和诗歌创作的盛年；但他也和他们一样，终生献身于革命事业，用自己的英勇革命斗争和充满革命激情的诗歌作品，在保加利亚人民的革命斗争史上和革命诗歌的发展史上，写下了最辉煌的篇页！
    尼古拉·瓦普察洛夫于1909年12月7日诞生在保加利亚西南部皮林山区班斯利城的一个马其顿革命者的家庭里。他的母亲是位博学而又有教养的妇女，从童年时起，就教会了瓦普察洛夫朗诵保泰夫和伐佐夫的革命诗歌，并且还培养了他对于祖国、人民、自由和劳动的热爱。1926年，瓦普察洛夫进了瓦尔纳城的航海机械学校，在学生时代和实习期间，他最初接触了革命的水兵们，并且受到共产主义思想的影响。从航海机械学校毕业之后，摆在他面前的就是失业的问题。为了解决生活困难，他不得不到造纸工厂和火车头上去当火伕，在废物利用工厂里当机工，这就使得他有可能和劳动人民发生了密切的联系，并决心要为无产阶级争取解放的事业而斗争。这样他就加入了保加利亚工人党的队伍，献身于保加利亚人民的革命斗争事业。
    瓦普察洛夫在中学时代就已经开始写作，当他在索非亚居住期间所发表的诗歌作品，曾得到社会的好评和公认。1940年，他的第一本诗集，也是他一生中仅有的一本诗集“马达之歌”出版了，这本诗集立即奠定了他在保加利亚革命诗歌中的不朽的地位。这本诗集开头的第一首诗“信念”，是唯一的一首没有经过审查的诗。瓦普察洛夫在这里有力地讲出了一个革命诗人和战士的不可摧毁的信念：
          也许你们想要
          毁灭掉
          我对于
          幸福的日子的信念；
          我对于明天
          生活得将会更加美好，
          生活将会更有意义的
          信念？
          请问，你们怎样进攻它？
          用子弹吗？
          不！没有用！
          去你的吧！——不要枉费心机！
          它的胸膛
          装着坚固的铁甲，
          用来进攻它的
          穿甲弹，
          还没有发明！
          还没有发明！
    就在这本诗集里的“工厂”、“回忆”、“我们要建造工厂”等诗中，瓦普察洛夫写出了保加利亚工人阶级的悲惨的和不幸的命运，写出了他们所进行的英勇斗争；在“祖国”、“土地”等诗中，写出了他对于祖国的热爱；在“关于某一个国家”的组诗中，写出了他对于战斗的西班牙人民的无限同情。更重要的，就是他在自己的诗歌作品中，用对于未来美好的日子的向往，用对于革命事业和共产主义事业必胜的信念来鼓舞和激励保加利亚人民。
    在第二次世界大战爆发前后，随着法西斯的威胁日益严重，瓦普察洛夫曾利用担任“文学批评”报的编辑的机会，团结了很多进步的作家，共同来进行反对法西斯主义的斗争。1941年6月22日，德国法西斯背弃信义进攻苏联，保加利亚的亲法西斯政府出卖了祖国的利益，把自己的国土变成为德国法西斯匪徒的军事基地。这时候，瓦普察洛夫作为保加利亚工人党的中央委员，参加了中央军事委员会，并把自己全部的精力都贡献给地下的秘密革命工作。他到过瓦尔纳城，和苏联取得秘密联系；同时他还领导各地进行武装斗争和各种破坏爆炸的工作。作为诗人的瓦普察洛夫突然变成了一位英勇的战士；他当时曾在一首未完成的诗中（“不，现在不是写诗的时候”）写出了自己的心情。1942年3月4日的早晨，瓦普察洛夫不幸被捕，在警察厅里受尽了各种严刑拷打，但正像他在“信念”一诗中所讲的，一切摧毁他的坚强信念和意志的企图都是枉然的。7月6日军事法庭举行审讯，瓦普察洛夫在法庭上进行了英勇的抗辩，并且以大无畏的精神讲道：“诸位法官先生，……我的活动，……正是为了反对在我们国家里的德国军队、反对法西斯分子和他们的保加利亚帮凶们。我是怀着明显的自觉在活动的，就是要为了自己祖国的自由而斗争。对于我的这个活动，你们想怎样判决就怎样判决。……我为了我的祖国的幸福而斗争，并且准备为了它而死亡！”7月23日瓦普察洛夫被判处死刑，他和其他几位反法西斯的革命志士同在军用打靶场的地道里被枪毙了，死的时候，他只有三十三岁。他和他的同志们，一同唱着保泰夫的“谁在争取自由的斗争中倒下去，这个人并没有死亡”的著名的诗句英勇地从容就义。他的死是光荣的，用他自己的诗句来说：
        我清楚地知道
        我在生活中的位置，
        我决不会白白地
        就贡献出自己的生命。
        我要作为一个工人
        真诚地死掉，
        在我们
        为了面包和自由的斗争中死掉！
    瓦普察洛夫虽然死了，但他的精神并没有死亡！世界和平理事会为了对这位反法西斯的战士与保卫和平的战士崇高的敬意，曾在1953年6月决定把1952年的国际和平奖金的荣誉奖追赠给他。对于中国人民，瓦普察洛夫是一个非常熟悉的名字，他的充满革命激情的诗歌今天也为我们的读者广泛地传诵着。
    瓦普察洛夫并没有死亡！他永远和我们在一起！我们永远记着他在殉难前写的这样几行诗：
        斗争是无情的残酷。
        斗争，正像人们所说的，像史诗。
        我倒下去了。……
        但在暴风雨里，我们还是和你们在一起……
