A Trip to Baiyangdian
Li Huixin

	Early in the morning, I boarded a fish scull and headed straight from Xin Town to Baiyangdian.

	With a smooth wind, the sail was full, and the boat moved faster than a steamer, sweeping past the scenery on both sides of the river. Suddenly, Old Song, who was steering the boat, lowered the sail and the mast, and the boat spun around in place. After going not far, he raised the mast again and hoisted the sail. I was puzzled, and then the sail came down again. "What, has the wind changed?" I asked anxiously.

	"No," Old Song said, raising his head towards the sky. "Didn't you see that we're avoiding the overhead wires?"

	Only then did I notice some scattered small power stations on the south bank of the Daqing River. In the short distance of just over half a mile, the mast was lowered three times. I became a little impatient: "These wires are really in the way!"

	"Old Li, you can't say that," Old Song retorted. "We're hoping that the day will come soon when the wires in the sky are as dense as a fishing net. Then, our Baiyangdian will be like a small Beijing."

	"How will sailboats travel then!" I said.

	"Old Li! Why are you so narrow-minded? Am I, Old Song, going to sail these small boats forever? By then, I, Old Song, will also be driving a small 'Jim Car' (as the villagers call small steamers). Just step on the gas, and with a 'toot' you'll be miles away," he said, laughing heartily.

	"This little sailboat, if the wind is with you, it goes smoothly; but against the wind, it takes a lot of effort! Look," Old Song pointed to the shore, "that string of three people are trackers."

	I saw three young men with bare upper arms, bending over and struggling forward. Behind them, a little more than a yard away, a boat filled with goods was slowly moving on the water. Only then did I understand Old Song's eagerness to drive a "Jim Car."

	After passing Zhaobeikou, the river gradually widened, and the water, I don't know when, had changed from murky to crystal clear. I cupped some in my hand and drank a few mouthfuls, and my heart immediately felt sweet and refreshing. The naturally and artificially sown reeds grew to be more than ten feet tall, looking dense and lush from a distance, like impervious, green walls. At this moment, I naturally thought of the novels describing Baiyangdian during the Anti-Japanese War. In the book, the reed marshes were compared to copper walls and iron ramparts, and today I truly understand what that meant.

	At this time, Old Song also talked to me about the situation at that time: "Don't think the devils were so fierce with their 'wah-yah, wah-yah' cries. Their small steamers would be blown over at any time as soon as they went 'toot-toot'. Later, the devils simply didn't dare to get close to Baiyangdian. The ambushes were really beautiful!"

	Unknowingly, the boat had sailed into the East Dian of Baiyangdian. Here, the area is about ten miles in radius, and the lake water is crystal clear. At the extreme end, you can vaguely see the dividing line between the sky and the lake water.

	In the evening, we arrived at Quantou. It was still eighteen miles away from Xin'an. Since there was no boat to Xin'an that night, I stayed at Old Song's house overnight.

	Old Song has a harmonious family. There is an old mother in her sixties taking care of the housework. Old Song's wife also participates in the work of the commune. There are four children, the eldest daughter graduated from senior primary school the year before last and is now a work point recorder in the commune. The other two go to elementary school, and there is a three-year-old boy in the nursery team. Their family is very warm and hospitable, and they took out freshly ground wheat to make pancakes to entertain Old Song and me, who had returned from afar.

	The next morning, I said goodbye to Old Song's family and boarded a small sailboat, heading straight to Xin'an. According to the recent division of counties and districts, this small town has been designated as a township in Xushui County.

	The commune office was empty, with only one person left to take care of the phone. All the staff, including the five secretaries of the commune, had gone down to participate in flood control. When I went, I happened to meet Secretary Ruan of the commune, who was going to Dazhangzhuang to inspect flood control work, so I went with him.

	Out of the South Gate, we took the North Dam road. On the lake, we could often see flocks of ducks grazing. Secretary Ruan introduced to me, "The ducks raised in Dazhangzhuang are second to none in Baiyangdian. The ducklings bought from the township are the same, but those raised in Dazhangzhuang are almost half-grown ducks, but those in other villages are only half the size of those in Dazhangzhuang." I asked what the reason was. Secretary Ruan smiled and said, "Don't underestimate raising ducks, it's a profound technology!"

	Later, living in Dazhangzhuang, I met the duck raising team leader, Old Zhang. He has been raising ducks for forty or fifty years. He explained to me in detail the things to pay attention to when raising ducks, such as young ducks cannot be driven into deep water, but can only be grazed in water more than a foot deep. He also told me that Dazhangzhuang, with only a hundred or so households, has the task of raising 10,000 ducks, but they are now raising 20,000, exceeding the quota by a hundred percent.

	The impression that Dazhangzhuang gave me was that the people here have amazing calmness and courage. On the first day I arrived in Dazhangzhuang, the streets had already been flooded, and several elderly people were using "water dragons" to pump water out. Although this village is not large, it has a complete primary school with four or five hundred students. The terrain of this primary school is the lowest in the whole village, so it is also the place in the whole village that gets flooded the earliest. The elementary school students waded through water that was deeper than their thighs to school to persist in attending classes, until the legs of the desks were submerged, and the school announced a temporary suspension of classes.

	According to the elderly, the rainfall this year is extraordinarily heavy. In one day, the village rose more than a foot. However, the surging flood did not frighten the people of Dazhangzhuang. On the contrary, people are seizing all the time to carry out intense labor. The water outside the canteen has reached the threshold, but the electric flour mill installed in the courtyard is still spinning rapidly. Several high school graduates who are watching the machines take turns shoveling soil to build a sub-dike next to the machine. I asked them when the machine would stop. A young man mischievously winked and said with a smile, "When the flood washes the machine away, we won't grind anymore."

	All the labor and semi-labor force in the village went to the North Dam. I went with the women. The water in the street was already half a person deep, and it was more than enough to sail a boat. Production team leader Xiao Fang rowed a boat to pick up the women who were going to the dam.

	People call this dam the "Thousand-Li Dam," but it is not a thousand li, only a hundred or so li long. Inside the dam are millions of acres of rice fields, and outside the dam is the lake water of Baiyangdian. Baiyangdian is the confluence of nine rivers, including the Daqing River, Ziya River, Cao River, and Juma River. Every summer, no matter which river rises, it will affect the water level of Baiyangdian. Therefore, repairing the "Thousand-Li Dam" every year is the main task of flood control, and this year is no exception.

	There are about 30,000 people in the army repairing the dam. In addition to the labor force from the water village, there is also a large part from the dry land, and even people from Nanzhang and Beizhang, which are fifty or sixty li away from the dam, come to help. The elderly often lamented, "Chairman Mao's leadership is good. When there are difficulties, everyone helps. In the past, people would not take action if the water did not flood their own village, let alone being fifty or sixty li apart." I stayed on the dam for three days and three nights and saw the newly built sub-dike withstand the test of a rainstorm. When I left there, the water outside the dike had begun to recede. When I left, Hu, the section chief of the Aquatic Products Bureau, said regretfully to me, "It would be good if you left a few days later. When the water recedes again, the fish harvesting in Baiyangdian will begin. In just half a day, you can fill a small boat with various kinds of white fish."

	Although I have been to Baiyangdian for less than half a month, including the delays on the journey, it has left me with a very deep impression, whether it is the lush reeds or the snow-white, lovely flocks of ducks. More vivid, of course, are the hardworking, brave, and wise people of Baiyangdian.

    白洋淀行
    李惠薪
    清晨，我搭上鱼拨子，径直从新镇向白洋淀驶去。
    一路顺风，帆儿被风灌得满满的，船儿走的比轮船还快，两岸的景物一扫而过。突然，使船的老宋，落下了帆儿，放倒了桅杆，船儿直在原地打转。走了没有多远，他又立起了桅杆，拉上了篷。我正纳闷，帆儿又落下来了。“怎么，是变了风向了？”我有些焦急起来。
    “不是。”老宋冲着天扬扬头说，“你没看见这是躲天上的电线。”
    这时我才发现在大清河的南岸有些散在的小型发电站。在短短的一里多的行程中，一共放倒了三次桅杆。我有些不耐烦起来：“这些电线可真碍事！”
    “老李哟，你可别那么说。”老宋反驳道。“俺们就盼着快点有那么一天，天空中的电线像鱼网那么密，那时候，我们白洋淀就要像个小北京城了。”
    “那帆船怎么走呀！”我说。
    “老李哟！你怎么那么死心眼儿。俺老宋还驾一辈子这样的小船儿呀！到那时，俺老宋也驾起了小
  ‘吉姆卡’（社员们对小型轮船的称呼）只要脚一踩油门，嘟的一声就是几里下去了。”说完他哈哈地笑了起来。
    “这小帆船啦，要是顺风，走得倒挺顺当；要逆着风可就费大劲了！你看，”老宋用手向岸上一指，“那一串三个人就是拉纤的。”
    我看见三个赤裸着上臂的青年，弓着身子艰难地向前迈着步子，在他们身后一丈多远的地方有一只装满了货物的船，在水面上慢慢地移动。这时我才体会到老宋迫切想驾驶“吉姆卡”的心情。
    过了赵北口，河面渐渐宽敞起来，河水不知从什么时候起已经由混浊变得清澈见底了。我用手捧着喝了几口，心里顿时感到甜沁沁的。天然的和人工播种的苇子长得有一丈多高，远远望去蓊蓊郁郁的，好像是一道道风雨不透的、绿色的围墙。这时我自然地想起了描写白洋淀在抗日时期的小说来，书中把芦苇地比喻成铜墙铁壁，今天我才算真正地体会到了。
    这时老宋也跟我谈论起当时的情景来：“别看鬼子哇呀，哇呀，叫得挺厉害。他的小汽船只要嘟嘟一响，说不定什么时候就被炸翻了。后来鬼子们简直不敢挨近白洋淀了，那伏击打得可真漂亮！”
    不知不觉船已经驶进了白洋淀的东淀。这里方圆十里左右，湖水碧澄澄的，极远的尽头，可以隐约地看到天空和湖水的分界线。
    傍晚我们到了圈头。这里离新安还有十八里路，当晚已经没有开往新安的船了，我就留在老宋家里过夜。
    老宋有一个和睦的家。家里有个六十多岁的老娘照料家务。老宋的老婆也参加社里的劳动。儿女四个，大姑娘前年高小毕业后，就在社里当记工员，其余两个上小学，还有个三岁的小男孩放在幼儿队。他们一家子非常热情、好客，拿出新磨的麦子烙饼，用来款待远道归来的老宋和我。
    次日清早，我辞别了老宋全家，坐上了小帆船，径直来到了新安。这个小城，根据最近县、区的划分，它被划为徐水县的一个乡。
    公社办公室里空荡荡，只留下一个人照顾着电话，所有的工作人员，连公社的五位书记全部下去参加防汛去了。我去的时候，恰好碰见公社的阮书记要去大张庄检查防汛工作，我就和他同路了。
    出了南关，我们取道北大堤，在湖面上时常可以看到正在放牧的鸭群。阮书记向我介绍说：“大张庄养的鸭子，在全白洋淀是数一数二的。同样从乡里买来的雏鸭，大张庄养的已经快成半大鸭子了，可别的庄子也就只有大张庄的一半大。”我问这是什么原因，阮书记笑着说：“你可别小看养鸭子，这也是门高深的技术哩！”
    后来住在大张庄，我结识了养鸭子的小队长老张。他养鸭子已经有四、五十年的历史了。他详细地向我讲解了养鸭子要注意的事情，如雏鸭不能往深处赶，只能放牧在一尺多深的水上。他又告诉我，仅仅有一百来户的大张庄有着养一万只鸭子的任务，但是他们现在养着两万只，超额了一倍。
    大张庄所给予我的印象，是这里的人们有着惊人的镇静和勇敢。我到大张庄的第一天，街上已经进了水了，几个上了年纪的老人正在用“水龙”往外抽水。虽然这个庄子不大，但却有一个拥有四五百学生的完小。这所小学的地势，在全村来说是最低的，因此也是全村最早上水的地方。小学生们就趟着深过大腿的水到学校坚持上课，直到课桌的腿已被淹没了，学校才宣布暂时停课。
    据老人们讲，今年的雨水大的出奇，一天的功夫，村里就长一尺多水。但是，猛涨的洪水并没有吓倒大张庄的人们，相反的，人们正抓紧一切时间，进行着紧张的劳动。食堂外面的水已经齐到门坎儿了，而安装在院里的电力磨面机还在飞快地转动着。几个看机器的高小毕业生，轮流铲土修筑在机器旁边筑成的子埝。我问他们什么时候机器才停，一个小青年调皮地眨一眨眼睛，笑着说：“多?大水把机器冲跑了就不磨了。”
    村里的劳力、半劳力全部上了北大堤，我是和妇女们同去的。街里的水已有半人深，驶船早绰绰有余了。生产队长小芳划着船，挨户去接上堤的妇女。
    人们都称这道堤是“千里堤”，其实它不够一千里，只有百十里长，堤圈里是上百万亩的稻田，堤圈外面就是白洋淀的湖水。白洋淀是大清河、子牙河、漕河、拒马河等九条河的汇合处，每年夏季，不论那条河水涨了都会影响白洋淀的水位，因此每年整修“千里堤”就是防汛中的主要任务，今年更不能例外。
    修堤的大军共有三万人左右，这里面除了水乡的劳力外，还有很大的一部分来自旱地，甚至远距大堤五、六十里的南张、北张的人也跑来帮忙了。上了年纪的人常感慨地说：“毛主席就是领导的好，有了困难大家帮忙，要在从前，水没上自己的庄子是不会动手的，更何况相隔五、六十里了。”我在堤上一共住了三天三夜，看到新筑的子埝经受住了一次暴风雨的考验。当我离开那里的时候，堤外已经开始脱水了。临走时，水产局的胡科长遗憾地对我说：“你要是晚走几天就好了，等水再落一落，白洋淀的治鱼又要开始了。只一个上半天就可以装满一小船白花花的各式各样的鱼。”
    虽然算上旅途上的耽搁，我来白洋淀还不满半个月，但它却留给了我极深的印象，无论是那蓊郁的芦苇，还是那雪白的惹人喜爱的鸭群。更鲜明的，自然是那些勤劳、勇敢、智慧的白洋淀人了。
