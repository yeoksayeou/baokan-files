Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 13th: Since the anti-China incidents in Indonesia, more than two thousand Indonesian Chinese have returned to the motherland. They received a warm welcome from the People's Government and relevant departments as soon as they set foot on the motherland's soil.

These overseas Chinese returned to the country successively between September and the end of November. Many of them were in dire economic straits upon their return. Xie Guangqing, a 66-year-old repatriated overseas Chinese who had lived in Indonesia for over 40 years and worked as a miner and pepper plantation worker, brought back only a small, broken iron box given to him by a friend at the time of his departure and two pounds of pepper. He had nothing else. Overseas Chinese worker Lin Binglong had saved more than 7,000 Indonesian Rupiah through frugality, but when he wanted to return to China, Indonesia suddenly devalued its currency, and this amount was not even enough to buy a boat ticket.

The Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent staff to Shenzhen to warmly receive these returned overseas Chinese. Zheng Fangting, a 69-year-old returned overseas Chinese who arrived in Shenzhen in November, injured his left leg when the ship arrived in Hong Kong, making it difficult for him to move around. Upon arrival in Shenzhen, staff members of the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission carried him on and off the train. After arriving in Guangzhou, these overseas Chinese were placed in the Guangzhou Returned Overseas Chinese Service Center. The Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission made proper arrangements for their work and lives, generally within half a month, based on the principles of resettlement according to origin, primarily focusing on rural areas, and assigning those with skills according to their abilities. The Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also provided free food and lodging to impoverished returned overseas Chinese, issued them cotton clothing and bedding, subsidized travel expenses, and assisted them in returning to their hometowns or going to farms. When these returned overseas Chinese were about to leave for employment or return to their hometowns, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also held farewell parties for them and sent staff to accompany them to their destinations. These returned overseas Chinese were deeply grateful for the meticulous care of the People's Government. They expressed their determination to work hard in their new jobs and contribute to building a strong motherland.

    最近被迫从印度尼西亚归来
    二千多归侨投入祖国温暖怀抱
    他们的工作和生活迅速得到了妥善的安置
    新华社广州13日电　自从印度尼西亚排华以来，已经有二千多名印度尼西亚华侨回到祖国，他们一踏上祖国大门就受到了人民政府和有关部门的热情接待。
    这些华侨是在9月到11月底之间先后回到祖国的。许多人回国的时候经济很困难。六十六岁的老归侨谢光清，在印度尼西亚侨居四十多年，做过矿工、胡椒园工。他这次带回来的行李，只是临别时朋友送的一个小烂铁箱和二斤胡椒，此外一无所有。华侨工人林炳龙省吃节用积蓄了七千多盾印度尼西亚币，他要回国的时候印度尼西亚突然贬低币值，这七千多盾连买一张船票都不够。
    广东省华侨事务委员会派工作人员到深圳热情地接待这些归侨。11月间回到深圳的六十九岁老华侨郑仿廷，在轮船到香港时跌伤左腿，行动不便，到达深圳时，广东省华侨事务委员会的工作人员背着他上下火车。这些华侨到达广州后被安置在广州归国华侨服务所。广东省华侨事务委员会对于他们的工作和生活，根据按籍安置，主要面向农村，有技能者量才录用的原则，一般都在半个月内作出了妥善安置。广东省华侨事务委员会还对贫苦的归侨免费供给膳宿，给他们发放棉衣棉被，资助车船费协助他们返乡或前往农场。当这些归侨要启程去就业或返乡的时候，华侨事务委员会还为他们举行欢送会并派工作人员一直陪送他们到目的地。这些归侨对人民政府无微不至的关怀十分感激。他们表示要在新的工作岗位上好好工作，为建设自己强大的祖国贡献力量。
