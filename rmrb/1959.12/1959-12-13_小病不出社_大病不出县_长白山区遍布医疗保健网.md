Minor illnesses treated in the commune; major illnesses treated in the county.
Medical and Healthcare Network Spreads Throughout the Changbai Mountain Area

(Reported by this newspaper) The Tonghua Special District of Jilin Province has already established a medical and healthcare network throughout the mountain region, basically achieving the goal of every county having a hospital, every commune having a health clinic, and every production team having three personnel (healthcare worker, midwife, childcare worker), so that the mountain people can receive treatment for "minor illnesses without leaving the commune" and "major illnesses without leaving the county." Wherever there is a large labor force, there is medicine and medical care.

Before liberation, this region was plagued by epidemics of cholera, typhoid, smallpox, malaria, and other infectious diseases. Puerperal fever in mothers and tetanus in newborns also occurred frequently. Three major endemic diseases, Kaschin-Beck disease, Keshan disease, and goiter, posed a serious threat to the health of the mountain people. After liberation, the Party and the government vigorously developed medical and health undertakings. General hospitals were established in all cities and counties, and the number of city and county maternal and child health stations and epidemic prevention stations increased ninefold compared to the early days of the People's Republic of China. The number of district and township health clinics also increased more than fourfold, forming a unified medical and health network from top to bottom. The closer this medical and healthcare network is to the grassroots level, the more closely-knit it is, and the more significant its role. For example, Gushanzi Township (commune) in Liuhe County has two hospitals with simple beds available to accommodate inpatients. The sixteen management areas under the commune have established health clinics, and each production team has a total of 192 healthcare workers and midwives. After the formation of the medical and healthcare network, the role of medical institutions has been fully utilized. During the measles prevention and control efforts last year, Gushanzi Township completely controlled the spread of measles.

Using these widely established medical and healthcare networks, while continuously carrying out mass patriotic health campaigns, infectious diseases such as cholera, smallpox, and typhoid have been eradicated. Keshan disease, malaria, and other diseases have also been brought under control. Various localities have adopted measures to prevent and treat endemic diseases such as Kaschin-Beck disease and goiter, including expanding vegetable planting areas, increasing nutritional intake, promoting iodized salt, and exchanging grain and water, which have greatly reduced the threat of these endemic diseases. Last year, various cities and counties also promoted the comprehensive treatment methods of acupuncture, moxibustion, medicine, physiotherapy, and physical therapy from Henan Province for Kaschin-Beck disease, which has restored the health of more than 12,000 of the more than 20,000 Kaschin-Beck disease patients who received treatment, allowing them to return to the production front. At the same time, due to the establishment of more than 400 rural maternity homes and 350 midwifery stations in mountain villages, and the adoption of new midwifery and childcare methods, puerperal fever in mothers and tetanus in newborns have also been basically eliminated.

Through the "eliminate the four pests" campaign and large-scale environmental sanitation campaigns, the living habits of the people in the Changbai Mountain area have also greatly changed. Before liberation, plagues were prevalent every year in the Liudaogou area of Linjiang County. After liberation, not only have the plagues long been eradicated, but every household has clean windows and tidy furniture, and every household has a vegetable garden and flower garden. Many families have everyone washing their faces with towels and brushing their teeth every day. They are in good spirits and good health, so their attendance rate for labor production is very high.

### 小病不出社　大病不出县  长白山区遍布医疗保健网

    小病不出社　大病不出县
    长白山区遍布医疗保健网
    本报讯　吉林省通化专区已经在全山区建立了医疗保健网，基本上达到县县有医院，社社有卫生所，队队有三员（保健员、接生员、保育员），使山区人民“大病不出县”，“小病不出社”，那里有劳动大军，那里就有医有药。
    解放前，这个地区常年流行着霍乱、伤寒、天花、疟疾等传染病，产妇的产褥热和新生儿的破伤风也不断发生；大骨节病、克山病和甲状腺肿三大地方病，更严重威胁山区人民的健康。解放后，党和政府大力发展医疗卫生事业，各市、县普遍建立综合医院，市县妇幼保健站和防疫站较建国初期增长了九倍，区乡卫生所也增长了四倍多，形成了一个上下统一的医疗保健网。这种医疗保健网愈接近基层就愈严密，所起作用也特别显著。如柳河县孤山子乡（公社）拥有两个医院，院中设了简易病床，可以收容住院患者。公社所属十六个管理区，都建立了卫生所，各生产队共有保健员、接生员一百九十二人。医疗保健网形成后，充分发挥了医疗机构的作用。在去年麻疹防治中，孤山子乡就完全控制了麻疹的流行。
    运用这些广泛建立的医疗保健网，同时不断开展群众性的爱国卫生运动，已经使霍乱、天花、伤寒等传染病绝迹；克山病、疟疾等也被制服。各地对预防大骨节和甲状腺肿等地方病，采取了扩大蔬菜播种面积、增加生活营养、推广碘盐以及采取换粮换水等措施，大大减少了这些地方病的威胁。去年各市县又推广了河南治疗大骨节病的针、灸、药、理、体的综合性治疗方法，已经使二万多名接受治疗的大骨节病患者中一万二千多人，恢复了健康，投入生产战线。同时，山村中由于建立了四百多处农村产院和三百五十处接生站，采取了新法接生和新法育儿，产妇的产褥热和新生儿的破伤风也已基本消灭。
    经过“除四害”和大搞环境卫生运动，长白山区的群众生活习惯也大为改观。临江县六道沟一带解放前年年流行瘟疫，解放后不仅瘟病早已绝迹，而且家家窗明几净，户户有菜园花园，很多人家都人人用毛巾洗脸，天天刷牙，他们心情舒畅，身体健康，因此劳动生产出勤率很高。
