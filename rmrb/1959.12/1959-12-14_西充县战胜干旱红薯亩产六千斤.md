Xinhua News Agency Report: Xichong County, Sichuan Province, overcame a drought unseen in a century, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest of sweet potatoes. The county's 223,000-plus mu of sweet potatoes have now been harvested. After inspection and verification, the average yield per mu reached 6,218 jin, an increase of 52.1% in unit area yield compared to last year.

When planting sweet potatoes this year, the county encountered an extreme drought. Various communes widely carried out large-scale cooperation. At that time, there was no water on the mountains, so they carried it from the rivers; when there was no water in the rivers, they dug into the riverbeds. When the sun was strong, they used leaves to cover the sweet potato seedlings; when the weather was hot and the ground temperature was high, they applied fertilizer and watered to lower the temperature and help the seedlings grow. The county excavated more than 120,000 underground water sources, irrigating each mu of sweet potato fields with 100 loads of water at a time, watering five times or more in total. In this way, they ensured a bumper harvest of 220,000 mu of sweet potatoes.

    西充县战胜干旱红薯亩产六千斤
    据新华社讯　四川省西充县战胜百年未有的大旱，红薯空前大丰收。全县二十二万三千多亩红薯现已收获，经过验收核实，平均亩产六千二百一十八斤，单位面积产量比去年增加百分之五十二点一。
    这个县今年栽薯的时候，正逢特大干旱。各个公社广泛开展了大协作。当时山上没有水，就从河里担；河里没有水，就向河底淘。太阳大，就用树叶遮盖薯苗；天气热地温高，就施肥浇水，降温提苗。全县挖掘了地下水源十二万多处，每亩薯地一次灌水一百挑，前后浇灌了五次以上。就这样，保证了二十二万亩红薯获得丰收。
