Xinhua News Agency, 2nd December. Washington dispatch: Deputy Secretary of State Murphy, who will accompany U.S. President Eisenhower on his overseas visit, emphasized in a speech at the National Press Club on December 1 that the "position of strength" policy pursued by the U.S. government will remain unchanged.

Murphy stated that Eisenhower's visit to eleven countries this time is aimed at seeking initiative for the increasingly isolated and bankrupt American diplomacy. He expressed disagreement with some people in the United States who believe that this visit "is not a desirable thing, it is better to stay at home," believing that this is tantamount to the U.S. government "sitting still" in diplomacy. Murphy said, "We cannot answer all questions on the basis of immobility."

Murphy emphasized that the "basic principles of American foreign policy are consistent," and its cornerstone is to "maintain a position of strength." He said: "Without strength, our national security would be in serious danger when we implement foreign policy."

Murphy then played the "Cold War" cliché, admitting on the one hand that the Soviet Union was "seeking to ease tensions"; but, on the other hand, he deliberately smeared the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions, saying that there were so-called "mutually contradictory factors of belligerence and reconciliation" in the Soviet policy.

In his speech, Murphy also expressed great unease about the Soviet Union's tremendous achievements and grand prospects in economy and science and technology, clamoring "we should obviously not underestimate this challenge." Obviously feeling powerless to reverse the situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, Murphy pinned his hopes on the absurd fantasy that the Soviet Union's socialist system would "deteriorate."

### 美国副国务卿墨菲承认  “实力”是美外交政策基石

    美国副国务卿墨菲承认
    “实力”是美外交政策基石
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：即将陪同美国总统艾森豪威尔出国访问的副国务卿墨菲1日在全国新闻俱乐部发表演说时强调，美国政府推行的“实力地位”政策仍将不变。
    墨菲表明，艾森豪威尔这次到十一个国家进行访问，目的是要为日益陷于孤立和破产的美国外交谋求主动。他表示不同意美国国内一些人以为这个访问“不是一件可取的事情，倒不如呆在家里”的说法，认为这等于要美国政府在外交方面“坐着不动”。墨菲说，“我们不能在静止不动的基础上对一切问题作出回答”。
    墨菲强调指出，美国“外交政策的基本原则是始终一贯的”，它的基石是要“维持实力地位”。他说：“要是没有实力的话，在我们执行外交政策时，我们国家的安全就会遭到严重危险。”
    墨菲于是大弹“冷战”滥调，他一方面承认苏联在“谋求缓和紧张局势”；但是，另一方面又故意对苏联的和平意图进行污蔑，说苏联的政策中存在着所谓“好战和和解的互相矛盾的因素”。
    墨菲在演说中还对苏联的经济和科学技术的巨大成就和宏伟的远景表示很大的不安，叫嚷“我们显然不应轻视这种挑战”。显然是由于自感无力扭转这个东风压倒西风的局势，墨菲把他的希望寄托在苏联的社会主义制度“变质”的荒唐幻想上。
