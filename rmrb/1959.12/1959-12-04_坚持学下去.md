    Persist in Studying
    Hua Ren
    The theoretical study of the worker and peasant masses is a great ideological revolution. However, without the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and without the rapid development of all aspects of our country, there would not have been such broad masses consciously demanding to study theory. Workers, peasants, cadres, soldiers, and street residents, tens of thousands of people have begun to explore the mysterious "palace" of theory. Is this accidental?
    With the development of China's economic situation, workers directly participate in production management, and farmers also have to concern themselves with national affairs, which poses new subjects for them: To be good masters of the country, in addition to practical work, they must also be resourceful and decisive, come up with ideas, and think of ways. Only in this way can they manage the affairs of the country well and promote the development of production. This is the fundamental reason why the broad masses of workers and peasants urgently demand to study theory.
    The facts are also like this. After studying "On Contradiction," the workers of the Shanghai Qiu Xin Shipyard consciously grasped the key problems in production. They said: "Grasping the key is grasping the main contradiction. Grasping the main contradiction in production is like leading a bull by the nose. If you want to lead a bull, what do you pull? If you pull the horns, it will butt; if you drag the tail, it won't move. Only by holding the key point of the bull's nose will it obediently follow you." The working class learns theory and easily grasps the essence of the problem. Today, there is also a good example in the news from Harbin published in this newspaper. In the "high quality and high yield" red flag competition carried out in the Third Workshop of the First Tool Factory, some people put forward the argument that "high quality cannot produce high yield." At this time, the workers used the philosophical theory they had learned to refute the above point of view and promote production. Workers and peasants are practitioners of production, and it is easy to connect with reality when they learn theory, so they can use what they learn and see immediate results.
    At present, the vast majority of places have persisted in theoretical study; however, a few places have relaxed their leadership in this area due to tight production, which needs to be paid attention to. As mentioned above, once the worker and peasant masses grasp the theory, it does not affect production, but promotes it. As long as time is properly arranged and theory is studied persistently, it is not something that cannot be done. Moreover, after more than a year of practice, the broad masses of workers and peasants have a generally high enthusiasm for theoretical study, and have accumulated some experience. As long as we can actively lead and persist in studying, we will definitely learn better and better, and the effect will become increasingly apparent.

    坚持学下去
    华仁
    工农群众学理论，是一个巨大的思想革命。然而没有1958年的大跃进，没有我国各方面的飞跃发展，也就不会有这样广大的群众自觉地要求学习理论。工人、农民、干部、士兵、街道居民，成千成万的人开始探索理论的神秘的“宫殿”。这难道是偶然的吗？
    随着我国经济形势的发展，工人直接参加了生产管理，农民也要过问国家大事，这就给他们提出了新的课题：要当好国家的主人，除了实干，还必须多谋善断，出点子，想办法。只有这样，才能管好国家大事，才能促进生产的发展。这是广大工农群众迫切要求学习理论的根本原因。
    事实也是如此。上海求新造船厂的工人，在学习了“矛盾论”以后，就自觉地抓生产上的关键问题。他们说：“抓关键就是抓主要矛盾。生产上抓主要矛盾就好比牵牛鼻子。人要牵一条牛，你拉什么？拉牛角，它会顶；拖牛尾，又拖不动。只有牵住牛鼻子这一关键，它就乖乖地跟你跑了。”工人阶级学理论，很容易掌握住问题的本质。今天，本报发表的哈尔滨的新闻中，也有个很好的例子。第一工具厂第三车间在开展“优质高产”的红旗竞赛中，有部分人提出“优质不能高产”的论调。这时，工人们就用自己学习的哲学理论，驳倒了上述论点，促进了生产。工人和农民是生产的实践者，在学习理论时容易联系实际，因此学了就能用，立刻见效。
    目前绝大多数地方都坚持了理论学习；但也有少数地方因为生产紧张，放松了这方面的领导，需要引起注意。如上所述，工农群众一旦掌握了理论以后，不是影响了生产，而是推动了生产。只要把时间作适当的安排，坚持学习点理论，并不是办不到的事情。况且，经过一年多的实践，广大工农群众对理论有着普遍高涨的学习热情，而又积累了一些经验，只要我们能够积极领导，坚持学下去，一定会愈学愈好，效果也会日益显露出来。
