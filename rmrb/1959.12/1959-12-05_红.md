    Red is a symbol of beauty and happiness. The working people of our country have always loved the color red. During the Spring Festival, red couplets are pasted up. On festive occasions, red silk fabrics are hung. If an actor's skills are outstanding, it is said that he has become "red."...
    In our era, red has become a color symbolizing revolution. People like red not only for its color but also for the revolutionary content it represents. As far back as the period of the domestic revolutionary war, our revolutionary troops were called the Red Army. People placed their hopes for happiness on them and praised them as myths. Now, the revolutionary red color has spread all over the motherland. Red flags are waving everywhere, and everyone is striving for the red flag. "A red start, red every day, red every ten days, red every month!" This is the bold statement of hundreds of millions of people. People are red in their hearts, and they have created miracles that their ancestors never had!
    The red commune member movement carried out in Yongji County is a concrete illustration of this. Because red is not just a randomly attached title, but it has definite content. For a red commune member, he must listen to the Party, obey the leadership, he must be active in labor, and love the commune as his home... Only by truly achieving all of this can one be called a red commune member. In a commune, when the number of such members increases, their spirit of loving socialism and their high revolutionary enthusiasm will inevitably spread and become a model for everyone to learn from. In the face of these red people, everything else will also turn red. Look, the Huapichang People's Commune used to be a relatively backward commune, but since the launch of the red commune member movement, a leap forward has immediately appeared. The county party committee summarized the experience of this commune, and after promoting it throughout the county, the entire county showed a thriving scene. In less than a year, 80% of the poor management areas in the county have caught up with the wealthy management areas!
    Our era is a red era. The red flag of the General Line will be held higher and higher, and our leap forward pace will become larger and larger!

    红，是美丽和幸福的象征。我国劳动人民，从来就喜欢红的颜色。过春节，要贴红的对联。有喜庆节日，要挂红的彩绸。哪个演员技艺超群，就说他唱“红”了。……
    到了我们这个时代，红又成为象征革命的色彩。人们喜欢红，不再仅仅限于它的颜色，而在于它所代表的革命内容。远在国内革命战争时期，我们的革命部队叫做红军，人们将幸福的希望寄托在他们身上，大家把他们当做神话来歌颂。现在，象征革命的红色更是染遍了祖国大地。到处红旗招展，个个争夺红旗。“开门红，日日红，旬旬红，月月红！”这就是亿万群众的豪言壮语。人们红在心里，干出了祖祖辈辈未有过的奇迹！
    永吉县开展的红色社员运动，就是这方面的一个具体写照。因为，红，不是随便附加的一个称号，而是有着确确实实的内容。以一个红色社员来说，他必须听党的话，服从领导，他必须劳动积极，爱社如家，……真正做到了这一切，才能称做一个红色社员。在一个公社里，这样的社员增多了，他们热爱社会主义的精神，他们的高涨的革命干劲，必然会扩展开来，成为大家学习的榜样。在这些红色人的面前，其他一切也会红起来的。你看，桦皮厂人民公社原来是个比较落后的社，只从开展红色社员运动后，马上就出现了一片跃进局面。县委总结了这个社的经验，在全县推广后，全县都呈现了欣欣向荣的景象。不到一年工夫，全县有80％的穷管理区，都赶上了富裕管理区！
    我们的时代，是一个红的时代。总路线的红旗，必将愈举愈高，我们的跃进步伐，也会越迈越大！
