Li Shusen, a model pig breeder in the Second Management Area of the Huojing Brigade of the Hongqi People's Commune in Pengxi County, Sichuan, is an expert at transforming Category Three pigs. Over the past year, he has cured sick pigs, fattened skinny pigs, and strengthened weak pigs, returning a total of 140 Category Three pigs to their original breeding units. He is currently responsible for raising another 114 Category Three pigs.

When I visited, I saw groups of plump, rolling pigs grazing on the barren hillsides. Li Shusen said, "These pigs were so skinny when they arrived that they were just skeletons. They had to be carried or lifted here. Now, they've completely changed, and they're about to be discharged!"

Li Shusen is 54 years old. He has rich experience in raising pigs and understands their habits thoroughly. Therefore, he has a set of methods for raising Category Three pigs. At the end of 1958, he was responsible for feeding eight Category Three pigs. At the beginning, the eight pigs were staggering and falling. He knew at a glance that it was caused by poor feeding, with times of plenty and times of starvation. Therefore, he first cleaned the pigsty inside and out, and trained the pigs to develop the habit of not defecating and urinating randomly and loving cleanliness. In terms of pig feed, he ensured that it was timed and quantified, with small meals frequently, and that coarse and fine feed were eaten evenly. He also added a little salt and herbal medicine to strengthen their spleen and stomach. After feeding, he would drive them up the mountain for a while to help them digest. In less than twenty days, all eight pigs grew fat and plump. From then on, Li Shusen's reputation for raising Category Three pigs spread. Later, a sow in the First Canteen Feeding Farm of the Huojing Brigade fell ill, lying down to defecate and urinate. When this sow was carried into the pig farm, some people said sarcastically, "If anyone can raise this sow alive, I'll fry fish with my palm!" Li Shusen didn't lose heart when he heard this. He worked with the veterinarian to study and adopted a combination of local and foreign methods, using herbal medicine and injections to cure the pig's disease. He also used the bonus he received when he was named a model to buy tonics for the sow to eat. Because of his careful care, the sow quickly recovered her health, went into heat, and was bred, giving birth to twelve piglets in one litter. The last piglet born was particularly thin and weak, and it was shivering when placed in the nest. Li Shusen unbuttoned his cotton coat, stuffed it into his arms to keep it warm, ensuring that all twelve piglets survived. After the piglets reached one month old, Li Shusen sent them and their mother to the First Canteen. The canteen feeder said with emotion, "Li Shusen, you are truly a good example for us to learn from!"

Recently, the Huojing Brigade Party Branch and veterinary personnel summarized Li Shusen's main experiences in raising Category Three pigs: 1. Emphasize hygiene and cleanliness, wash feed clean, and keep feeding utensils clean; 2. "Three fixings," that is, fix feeding time, fix feeding quality, and fix feeding quantity, and regulate the number of feedings, portions, and fine or coarse feed according to the pig's height, strength, and needs. For those that are particularly thin, take the approach of fine first and then coarse, with small meals frequently, feeding two to four times a day; as the pigs gradually grow stronger, gradually reduce the number of meals and increase the coarse feed; 3. "Five no's," that is, do not feed stale food, do not feed moldy feed, do not feed raw and cold food, do not feed before the prescribed time, and do not feed wild feed that has not been cooked thoroughly; 4. "Four carefulnesses," that is, careful management, finely grind the concentrated feed, finely chop the green feed, and process coarse feed into fine feed; 5. "Three medicines," that is, use medicine to treat diseases, use medicine to remove insects, and use medicine to prevent diseases and insects when there are no diseases or insects; 6. According to the pig's life rhythm and physical strength, allow the pigs to have a certain amount of time to move freely in the wild every day, sunbathe, promote good digestion, and grow strong. The Huojing Brigade has held on-the-spot meetings many times at the feeding farm managed by Li Shusen to promote his experience in raising Category Three pigs. (Reporter Gan Quan from Sichuan Daily)

Guan Baohu

Recently, Guan Baohu's rich pig-raising experience has been widely praised in some areas of the Jiangmen Special Zone in Guangdong.

Guan Baohu is a feeder in the Buxi Production Team of the Yijing Brigade in the Tangkou Commune of Kaiping County. He and two other feeders have raised 328 pigs for the team in the past year, an average of one and a half pigs per mu of land.

What is most admirable is that Guan Baohu can turn skinny pigs into fat pigs. Among the more than 300 pigs he raises, more than 200 were originally skinny pigs. These more than 200 pigs had been raised in other places for one or two years but did not grow big, so they were sold to the Buxi Production Team.

"Guan Baohu specializes in taking in skinny pigs" has become well-known news among people near the Tangkou Commune. Whoever's pigs don't grow big likes to call Guan Baohu to take them in. Once, Guan Baohu went to the neighboring Shengping Brigade to catch seven skinny pigs. A relative saw him and said bluntly, "Do you still want to raise these pigs? Look, some have been raised for two years, and they still look like monkeys." Guan Baohu smiled and said, "Don't worry, come and see in a month." Sure enough, a month later, those seven skinny pigs that looked like monkey skins had all turned into big, fat pigs.

How does Guan Baohu turn skinny pigs into fat pigs? According to him, there is no mystery, just "put in some effort!" He studied the reasons why pigs don't fatten up: First, they are fed badly. Some "Category Three pigs" are originally weaker, and the feeders don't separate them into different pens, allowing them to eat feed in the same pen as stronger pigs, often not getting good food, and slowly damaging their appetite. Second, they are not hygienic. Most "Category Three pigs" have mange, and they "scratch" all day, consuming a lot of energy; originally, these pigs don't eat much, and with the added consumption, they slowly become "Category Three pigs" with "long mouths, big ears, hanging bellies, and thick skin." He formulated a method to transform "Category Three pigs" based on these two problems. That is, first, don't be afraid of dirt and odor, give these pigs baths to treat mange; second, differentiate by size and feed them in separate pens. The more than 200 "Category Three pigs" he took in grew fat and big using this method. Recently, he took in another 27 "Category Three pigs" from the Licun Brigade. Some of the piglets were even unsteady on their feet, so he brought them close to the trough to eat feed; two piglets didn't want to eat feed, so he held them and fed them spoonful by spoonful. Under his patient care, he finally rescued these 27 "Category Three pigs" from the brink of death and fattened them up.

　　两个收瘦养肥的养猪能手
　　李树森
    四川蓬溪县红旗人民公社火井区联队第二管理区有个改造三类猪的能手——模范饲养员李树森。一年多来，他把病猪治好，瘦猪变肥，弱猪变强，共养好了一百四十多头三类猪，送还了原来的饲养单位。现在，他负责养的三类猪还有一百一十四头。
    我前往访问时，只见他喂的一群一群肥滚滚的猪只，在荒山坡上放牧。李树森说：“这些猪来时瘦得只有一副骨架。不是背着来，就是抬着来的。现在，它们全变了样子，快要出院了！”
    李树森五十四岁，他有着丰富的饲养猪只的经验，摸透了猪的习性，因此，也有一套养三类猪的办法。1958年底，他负责喂八头三类猪。开始时，八头猪偏偏倒倒的，他一瞄，就知道是饲养不善，时饱时饿造成的。因此，他先把猪圈内外打扫干净，并且训练猪只养成不乱屙屎屙尿、爱清洁的习惯。在猪食方面，做到定时定量，少吃多餐，粗细饲料吃得均匀，并且加少许盐巴和草药健脾胃。喂食后，就赶上山去活动一阵，帮助消化。不到二十天，八头猪都长得肥滚滚的。从此，李树森养三类猪的名声就传开了。后来，火井区联队第一食堂饲养场有一只母猪病倒了，睡倒屙屎屙尿。当这只母猪抬进猪场时，有人冷言冷语说：“这头母猪谁能养活，我用手板心来煎鱼吃！”李树森听了并没有泄气。他找兽医共同研究，采取土洋结合办法，用草药、针药治好了猪病，并且把他被评为模范时所得的奖金买来补品给母猪吃。由于他细心照料，这头母猪也很快就恢复健康，发情了，并且配上了种，一胎就生了十二只小猪。最后生下的一只末尾猪特别瘦弱，放到窝里还打抖。李树森就解开棉衣，把它塞进怀里，让它取暖，保证了十二只小猪全部成活。小猪满月后，李树森把它们母子送到第一食堂，食堂饲养员感动地说：“李树森，你真是我们学习的好榜样！”
    最近，火井区党支部和兽医人员一起，总结了李树森饲养三类猪的几条主要经验：一、讲卫生，爱干净，饲料洗干净，?瓢等用具干净；二、“三定”，即喂食定时、定质、定量，按照猪的身高强弱和需要来规定喂食的次数、分量、细料或粗料。身体特别瘦的，则采取先细后粗、少吃多餐的办法，每天喂食二次到四次；随着猪只逐步强壮，逐渐减少餐次，增加粗料；三、“五不”，即不喂陈食，不喂霉料，不喂生冷，不到规定时间不喂，没有煮熟煮烂的野生饲料不喂；四、“四细”，即经营管理仔细，精饲料磨细，青饲料切细，粗饲料加工变成细料；五、“三药”，即有病用药治疗，有虫用药除掉，无病无虫喂药预防；六、根据猪的生活规律和身体强弱，每天让猪有一定的时间到野外自由活动，晒太阳，促进消化良好，生长健壮。火井区联队曾多次在李树森负责的饲养场开现场会，推广他的饲养三类猪的经验。（四川日报记者　甘泉）
    关保湖
    最近，在广东江门专区的一些地方，传颂着关保湖丰富的养猪经验。
    关保湖，是开平县塘口公社以敬大队步溪生产队的饲养员。他和其他两个饲养员，在最近一年来，给队里饲养三百二十八头猪，平均每亩田有猪一头半。
    使人赞叹不过的，是关保湖能将瘦猪养成肥猪。在他饲养的三百多头猪中，有二百多头原来是瘦猪。这二百多头猪，都是别地养了一年、两年，养不大，才卖给步溪生产队的。
    “关保湖专收瘦猪”，已经成为塘口公社附近人所共知的新闻。谁家的猪养不大，都喜欢叫关保湖收养。有一次，关保湖到邻近的升平大队去捉七头瘦猪，一个亲戚见了，直率地对他说：“你还想养大这些猪吗？你看，有的已养上两年了，还像马骝似的。”关保湖笑着说：“不怕，过一个月来看吧。”一个月后，果然那七头皮猴似的瘦猪，都变成了大肥猪。
    关保湖是怎样将瘦猪变肥猪的呢？据他自己讲，并没有什么奥妙的地方，就是“费些心机罢啦！”他研究了猪养不肥的原因：第一、是喂坏了。一些“三类猪”本来是较弱的，饲养员不会分窝，让它们和强猪同窝吃饲料，往往吃不到好东西，慢慢地就把胃口弄坏了。第二、是不卫生。“三类猪”大多生癞，整天“卡痒”消耗大；本来这些猪吃的就不多，加上消耗大，慢慢就变成“嘴长、耳大、肚吊、皮厚”的“三类猪”了。他针对这两个毛病，定出了改造“三类猪”的办法。这就是第一、不要怕脏怕臭，给这些猪洗澡治癞；第二、要区别大小，分栏喂养。他收养的二百多头“三类猪”，就是用这个办法育肥长大的。最近，他又向李村大队收养了二十七头“三类猪”，其中有的小猪连走路都不稳，他就把它们送近槽边吃饲料；有两头小猪不吃饲料了，他就抱着它们逐羹逐羹的喂。在他的耐心抚育下，终于把这二十七头“三类猪”从死亡的边缘挽救过来，并且养肥长大。
