Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The people of Western European countries have launched increasingly broad and large-scale mass movements over the past year to oppose the United States' establishment of missile bases and preparations for nuclear war in their countries.

The United States currently has approximately thirty units of missile forces equipped with medium-range and short-range missiles stationed in Europe. It has already built four medium-range missile bases in Britain; two medium-range missile bases in Italy are also under construction. It has also reached an agreement with Turkey on the establishment of medium-range missile bases and is negotiating with Greece to establish such bases. In addition, the United States has established ten short-range missile bases in West Germany and is directly assisting West Germany in its atomic armament, equipping the West German army with short-range missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. According to Bonn's "Parliamentary Political News Bulletin," the Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Group, controlled by the United States, plans to form a missile base network consisting of more than sixty missile battalions in ten Western European countries by the end of 1960 and to establish one hundred missile battalions in Western Europe by 1963.

Broad sections of people in Western European countries have long recognized the disasters that this mad nuclear arms race activity of the United States will bring to them and have waged a heroic struggle against the United States' establishment of missile bases in their countries. After the US-UK missile base agreement was announced last February, a wave of protests immediately swept across Britain. Since the beginning of this year, the movement against the establishment of American bases and against nuclear war policies has developed more vigorously. The social strata participating in these movements are becoming wider and wider, including not only communists and peace progressives, but also Labor Party members, scholars, and professors such as the famous philosopher Russell, non-interventionists, and religious figures such as Reverend Collins; there are young people, housewives, elderly people, and the disabled. The forms of mass action are also becoming more and more diversified. People not only hold demonstrations and rallies attended by tens of thousands of people, but also hold a series of protest encampments and vigils at various missile bases and nuclear weapons research and manufacturing centers. Construction workers refuse to work for American missile bases, and British peace warriors, disregarding the persecution of the Conservative government, would rather go to jail than give up the struggle against nuclear war, and even go on hunger strike in prison to protest.

The "March for Survival Demonstration" held in London on June 28, with the participation of 20,000 people, is a typical example of the British people taking action against the threat of atomic death. The march was organized by the British Peace Committee, and the various organized units participating in the march represented a total of approximately two million Britons. They came from all over Britain, from Scotland in the north to Wales in the southwest. At the end of the march, a mass meeting was held, demanding that the government abandon nuclear weapons and refuse to use the British Isles as missile bases and hydrogen bomb aircraft bases.

People from all walks of life in Britain also held a second march against nuclear weapons this Easter. This peaceful march started from Aldermaston, the British atomic weapons research center, and ended in London, lasting four days and covering a distance of one hundred and fifty li. Heavy rain could not stop people determined to fight against the shadow of nuclear destruction. When the team arrived at Trafalgar Square in the center of London, it had grown from 4,000 people at the start to an army of 15,000 people.

On December 26, British peace warriors once again held demonstrations against American military bases and hydrogen bombs. One hundred and fifty peace warriors in London held a continuous 52-hour anti-hydrogen bomb "Christmas Peace Vigil" in front of the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. In Liverpool, forty young peace warriors launched an anti-hydrogen bomb peace march from Liverpool on the west coast of England to Hull on the east coast. By the 29th, this team had expanded to more than 120 people.

The annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress held in September this year, despite the opposition of right-wing leaders, passed a resolution protesting the government's provision of British territory as American missile launch sites and demanding the cancellation of these missile bases. This resolution of the Trades Union Congress, which has eight million members, reflects the strong sentiment of the British people against the American "nuclear deterrence" policy.

In West Germany, despite the Adenauer government's frenzied persecution, the broad masses of people still carried out a tenacious struggle in difficult circumstances to oppose atomic armament and the establishment of missile bases.

According to reports, opinion polls held in various cities in West Germany show that more than 90% of those participating in the survey oppose atomic armament and advocate the removal of all nuclear weapons from German territory. The Bonn "Combat Committee Against Atomic Death," the Munich "Committee Against Atomic Armaments," and the Demaun City "Association for Combating Atomic Disaster" recently jointly launched a postcard campaign against atomic armament. From the last week of November to the 7th of this month, approximately 8,000 West German residents mailed postcards against atomic armament to the Bonn Federal Parliament.

The actions of the American and British occupation forces in establishing missile bases and storing various nuclear weapons in West Germany have aroused extremely strong reactions among the West German people. In the spring of this year, 600,000 residents of the Ruhr industrial city of Dortmund fiercely opposed the stationing of a British missile regiment equipped with American "Corporal" missiles in West Germany. Under the surging public sentiment, various political parties in Dortmund also rose up in opposition, and even Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union had to do so. As a result, the city council unanimously passed a resolution condemning the Adenauer government for allowing British missile forces to be stationed there. In addition, the residents of Nuremberg and the citizens of Qisun City also strongly protested the stationing of American atomic artillery units.

During the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference, people from all walks of life in West Germany sent telegrams and letters to the conference expressing their opposition to the threat of atomic death. West German and West Berlin student organizations participating in the youth representative conference held in Frankfurt am Main in late May, together with British student organizations, issued a joint statement to the Geneva Conference expressing their opposition to the installation of nuclear weapons on German territory.

After the United States forced the Italian government to agree to establish American missile bases in Italy, a movement against this traitorous agreement immediately unfolded vigorously throughout Italy. Workers, farmers, students, business, and cultural figures widely participated in this movement. Even some Italian military leaders expressed dissatisfaction with the government's dangerous promise. Former Chief of Staff of the Italian Armed Forces General Minella and former Chief of Staff of the Army General Ulicchi resigned in protest against the government's traitorous actions.

Many cities in Italy have convened mass rallies to protest the establishment of American missile bases in Italy. Spano, Secretary-General of the Italian "Peace Movement" Committee, pointed out at a rally that the Italian government's decision has serious consequences for the people, because once a war breaks out, Italy will inevitably be hit by a retaliatory attack from an aggressed country.

The Greek people are also firmly opposed to the establishment of American missile bases. When US President Eisenhower recently visited Greece, the Chairman of the Greek United Democratic Left Party, Pasalidis, wrote an open letter to Eisenhower pointing out that the Greek people oppose the establishment of American missile bases in Greece because the Greek people do not want to be a "beachhead for war." Twenty-six prominent Greek politicians and social activists, including former Prime Minister Gonatas and five former ministers, members of parliament, retired senior officials, and cultural figures, issued an appeal to the government, demanding that it refuse to set up missile bases on Greek territory and support the proposal to establish a nuclear and missile-free zone in the Balkans.

This year, British peace warriors have held successive peace demonstrations against American military bases and hydrogen bombs. This is a scene from one of them.

　　西欧人民阻止核武装运动声势越来越大
    1959—反美国导弹基地斗争高涨年
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：西欧各国人民一年来展开了越来越广泛的声势浩大的群众运动，反对美国在他们的国家建立导弹基地和准备核战争。
    美国目前在欧洲驻有装备着中程和短程导弹的导弹部队大约为三十个单位。它已经在英国建成了四个中程导弹基地；在意大利的两个中程导弹基地，也正在加紧施工。它还同土耳其达成了关于建立中程导弹基地的协议，并且正在同希腊谈判建立这种基地。此外，美国还在西德建立了十个短程导弹基地，并且直接帮助西德进行原子武装，以能够装备核弹头的短程导弹装备西德军队。据波恩的“议会政治新闻公报”透露，美国所控制的北大西洋集团最高司令部计划在1960年年底在西欧十个国家组成一个包括六十多个导弹营的导弹基地网，到1963年在西欧建立一百个导弹营。
    西欧各国的广泛阶层人士早已认识到美国这种疯狂的核备战活动将给他们带来的灾难，并且为反对美国在他们国家建立导弹基地进行了英勇的斗争。在去年2月美英导弹基地协定公布后，抗议的浪潮立刻席卷了全英国。今年以来，反对建立美国基地、反对核战争政策的运动更加蓬勃发展。参加这些运动的社会阶层越来越广泛，不但有共产党人和和平进步人士，而且有工党人士，有学者、教授如名哲学家罗素，有非战主义者和宗教界人士如柯林斯牧师；有青少年、家庭妇女、高龄老人和残废者。群众行动的方式也越来越多样化，人们不但举行成千上万人参加的示威游行和集会，而且还在各导弹基地以及核武器研究和制造中心举行了一连串的抗议性宿营和守夜。建筑工人拒绝为美国导弹基地工作，英国的和平战士们不顾保守党政府的迫害，宁愿坐牢也不放弃反对核战争的斗争，甚至在狱中还绝食抗议。
    今年6月28日在伦敦举行的两万人“争取生存示威游行”，是英国人民以行动反对原子死亡威胁的一个典型事例。这次游行是由英国和平委员会组织的，参加游行的各个有组织的单位总共代表大约二百万英国人。他们来自英国各地，从北部的苏格兰到西南部的威尔士。游行结束时举行了群众大会，向政府提出摒弃核武器以及拒绝利用英伦三岛作为导弹基地和氢弹飞机基地等要求。
    英国各界人士还在今年复活节举行了第二次反对核武器进军。这次和平进军从英国原子武器研究中心的阿尔德马斯顿出发，到伦敦结束，历时四天，行程达一百五十华里。滂沱大雨拦不住坚决同核毁灭的阴影作斗争的人们，当队伍到达伦敦中心的特拉法加广场时，它已经从出发时的四千人壮大为一万五千人的大军。
    12月26日，英国和平战士再次举行反对美国军事基地和反对氢弹的示威行动。伦敦一百五十个和平战士在唐宁街十号首相府门前，举行了连续五十二小时的反对氢弹“圣诞和平守夜”。在利物浦，四十名青年和平战士发起了从英国西海岸利物浦到东海岸赫尔的反氢弹和平进军，到29日，这支队伍已扩大到一百二十多人。
    今年9月举行的英国职工大会年会不顾右翼领导方面的反对，通过了一个决议，抗议政府提供英国国土作美国导弹发射场，并且要求取消这些导弹基地。拥有八百万会员的职工大会的这个决议，反映了英国广大人民反对美国“核威慑”政策的强烈情绪。
    在西德，尽管有阿登纳政府的疯狂迫害，广大人民仍然在艰苦的环境中进行了顽强的斗争，反对原子武装，反对建立导弹基地。
    据报道，在西德各城市举行的民意测验表明，参加测验的人有90％以上反对原子武装，主张从德国领土上取消一切核武器。波恩“反对原子死亡战斗委员会”、慕尼黑“反对原子军备委员会”和德芒市的“反对原子灾难斗争协会”不久以前联合发起了一个投寄反对原子武装的明信片运动。从11月最后一周起到本月7日止，就有大约八千名西德居民向波恩联邦议院投寄反对原子武装的明信片。
    美国和英国占领军在西德建立导弹基地和贮存各种核武器的行径，在西德人民中引起极其强烈的反应。今年春天鲁尔区工业城市多特蒙德有六十万居民猛烈反对装备着美国“下士式”导弹的英国导弹团进驻西德。在群情沸腾下，多特蒙德各政党，也起来反对，甚至阿登纳的基督教民主联盟也不得不这样做，结果这个市的市议会一致通过决议，谴责阿登纳政府允许英国导弹部队进驻。此外，纽伦堡的居民和岐孙市的市民，也强烈地抗议美国原子炮部队进驻。
    在日内瓦东西方外长会议期间，西德各阶层人士纷纷打电报和写信向会议表示，他们反对原子死亡的威胁。参加5月下旬在美因河畔法兰克福举行的青年代表大会的西德和西柏林学生组织，就同英国学生组织一起向日内瓦会议发出共同声明，表示反对在德国领土上设置核武器。
    在美国迫使意大利政府同意在意大利建立美国导弹基地之后，反对这种卖国协议的运动立即就在意大利全国各地蓬勃地展开了。工人、农民、学生、商界和文化界人士广泛参加了这一个运动。甚至一部分意大利军事领袖也对政府这种危险的允诺表示不满。意大利前武装部队参谋总长米涅拉将军和前陆军参谋长乌利契将军就因不满政府这种卖国行为而辞职。
    意大利的许多城市都召开了群众大会，抗议在意大利建立美国导弹基地。意大利“和平运动”委员会总书记斯巴诺在一次集会上指出，意大利政府的决定对人民具有严重的后果，因为一旦发生战争，意大利必然会遭到被侵略国家的回击。
    希腊人民也坚决反对建立美国导弹基地。希腊统一民主左翼党主席帕萨利迪斯在美国总统艾森豪威尔最近访问希腊时，曾经写公开信给艾森豪威尔指出希腊人民反对在希腊建立美国导弹基地，因为希腊人民不愿做“战争的滩头堡”。26名希腊著名政治家和社会活动家，其中有前首相戈纳塔斯和五名前任大臣、议员、退休的高级官员及文化界人士，向政府发出呼吁，要求拒绝在希腊领土上设置导弹基地，而支持在巴尔干建立无原子和导弹武器地区的主张。
    今年以来英国和平战士接连举行反对美国军事基地和氢弹的和平示威。这是其中一次的情景。
