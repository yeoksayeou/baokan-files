　　Sea Purslane
    Sea Purslane, also known as "xunfan" or "local vegetable," is a plant of the Chenopodiaceae family. It grows on the seashore, with an erect stem that branches out, reaching a height of three to four decimeters. It blooms with purple flowers in autumn and bears utricles. When processing sea purslane, first rinse the leaves with fresh water, then put them in a pot and boil them until cooked. Rinse them again with fresh water to remove the bitter taste. Then, place them in a vat, add fresh water (enough to submerge the feed), and soak for two to three days before taking them out to feed the pigs. This can be preserved in the vat for two to three months. When feeding, mix it with other feeds. Each medium-sized pig can be fed six to eight jin per day. (Attached image)

　　海松菜
    海松菜又叫做蟳饭、土菜，是藜科植物。生于海滨，茎直立，有分枝，高三到四分米，秋天开紫花，结胞果。加工海松菜时，可先把叶子用淡水冲洗，放进锅里煮熟，再用淡水冲洗一次，以除去苦味，然后装入缸内，加入淡水（以淹过饲料为度），浸二到三天后，就可以取出喂猪。这样放在缸内可保存二到三个月。喂时要和其他饲料拌和，中等猪每头每天喂六到八斤。（附图片）
