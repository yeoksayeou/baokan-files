    Qitai: A County Where All Cows and Horses are Mated and Pregnant
    (Our report) Xinjiang's Qitai County has over 8,500 mature cows and mares, with 94% confirmed pregnant, making it a county where all cows and horses are mated and pregnant.
    Qitai County is located on the north side of the Tianshan Mountains and is a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area. Last year, the county established four people's communes integrating agriculture and animal husbandry, and set up four commune-run ranches, implementing unified management and specialized administration, creating excellent conditions for the high-speed development of cattle and horse production.
    This year, in terms of mating, the establishment of six large animal artificial insemination stations, four large and small animal mixed mating stations, and mobile large animal mating stations enabled 80% of the female animals to be mated centrally, greatly increasing the pregnancy rate of female animals. This fundamentally changed the backward situation of insufficient breeding stock in agricultural areas and natural mating in pastoral areas. According to inspections by the Huojian (Rocket) and Hongqi (Red Flag) communes, the pregnancy rate of cattle and horses using artificial insemination averaged above 95%.
    Before communization, draught animals in agricultural areas had heavy labor burdens, making it difficult to achieve full-fat mating. In pastoral areas, because breeding was decentralized and pastures were not used rationally, female animals were weak, also making full-fat mating difficult. This year, before large animal mating, each commune adopted the method of temporarily drawing thousands of large animals from pastoral areas to support agricultural areas, ensuring the mating of mature female animals.
    In order to ensure the safe overwintering and calving of female animals, each commune promptly organized grass-cutting teams of thousands of people and specialized shed-building teams, working hard for dozens of days, so that each head of large livestock averaged one thousand kilograms of fodder, basically achieving that every head of large livestock had a shed, and pregnant female livestock had a warm shed (shed with three walls and mud on the roof), completely changing the past situation where more than 50% of large livestock had no shed to spend the winter.
    Before communization, due to the inability to fully and rationally use pastures, nearly four thousand heads of large livestock and female animals in the county lacked good winter pastures. This year, after the mating of large livestock, the county rationally adjusted winter pastures, giving all large livestock, especially female animals, good winter pastures.
    The people's communes are further strengthening the work of protecting pregnant female animals. Four hundred healthy cattle have been transferred from various ranches to support agricultural brigades, allowing female animals in agricultural areas to avoid miscarriages due to excessive labor.

    奇台——牛马全配满怀县
    本报讯　新疆奇台县八千五百多头适龄母牛、母马有94％怀胎，成为牛马满配满怀县。
    奇台县位于天山北面，是半农半牧区。去年全县成立了四个农牧结合的人民公社，建立起四个社办牧场，实行统一经营，专业管理，为高速度发展牛马生产创造了很好的条件。
    今年，在配种方面，由于建立了六个大畜人工授精站、四个大小畜混合交配站和流动大畜交配站，使80％的母畜集中进行交配，大大提高了母畜怀胎率。根本改变了从前农业区种畜不足、牧区实行自然交配的落后状况。据火箭、红旗两个公社的检查，实行人工授精的牛马，怀胎率平均都在95％以上。
    在公社化以前，农业区耕畜劳役繁重，很难做到满膘配种。牧区因为饲养分散，没有合理使用草场，母畜瘦弱，也很难做到满膘配种。今年各公社在大畜配种前，都采取从牧区临时抽调几千头大畜支援农区的办法，保证了适龄母畜的配种。
    为了保证母畜安全过冬生仔，各公社及时组织了上千人的打草队和搭盖圈棚专业队，大干了几十天，使每头大牲畜平均有一千公斤饲草，基本上作到头头大畜有圈棚，怀胎母畜有暖棚（三面是墙，顶上抹泥的圈棚），彻底改变了过去有50％以上的大畜没棚圈过冬的状况。
    公社化前，由于草场不能充分合理使用，全县有近四千头大畜和母畜没有良好的过冬草场。今年大牲畜配种后全县合理调剂了冬季草场，使所有的大畜、特别是母畜有了良好的过冬草场。
    各人民公社正进一步加强母畜保胎工作，已从各牧场抽调四百头健牛支援农业大队，让农业区的母畜避免因劳役过重流产。
