    A Handful of Highland Barley
    Zaxi Dunzhu held a handful of highland barley, leading his five-year-old son Ga'an, and hurried towards the lush Linka, where the festive drumbeats were sounding! At the top of a tall tent, a giant image of Chairman Mao hung high in the sky! White hadas and colorful flowers reflected Chairman Mao's benevolent smile! Zaxi Dunzhu held up the highland barley and presented it to the image with reverence: "Chairman Mao, this is the first time in generations that we have harvested the crops we planted ourselves!" He turned and hugged the child beside him, tears welling up on his dark red face: "Chairman Mao, these are my tears of joy, and future generations will forever escape from the abyss..." The "Wangguo" festival's bells and drums beat even more joyfully, and the liberated people gathered around the image of Chairman Mao. Zaxi Dunzhu raised the golden highland barley, scattering the seeds of happiness all over the vast plateau!

    一把青稞扎西顿珠抱着一把青稞，牵着五岁的儿子尕安，快步跑向绿郁的林卡，那里正响着节日的鼓点！在一个高大帐篷的顶端，毛主席的巨像临空高悬！洁白的哈达，缤纷的鲜花，照映着毛主席慈祥的笑颜！扎西顿珠捧起青稞，满怀敬意地送到像前：“毛主席，这是祖祖辈辈头一回呵，自己种的庄稼自己收还！”他回头又抱起身边的孩子，黑红的脸膛上泪如涌泉：“毛主席呵，这是我快活的眼泪，子孙后代永远跳出深渊……”“望果”节的钟鼓越敲越欢，翻身的人们围在毛主席像前，扎西顿珠举起金色的青稞，幸福的种子撒遍万里高原！
