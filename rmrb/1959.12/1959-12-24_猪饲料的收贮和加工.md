　　Pig Feed Collection, Storage and Processing
　　Editor's Note: Pigs are omnivorous animals, requiring a variety of nutrients and capable of digesting various feeds. Therefore, not only grains and other concentrated feeds but also by-products of crop processing, as well as wild grasses, vegetables, fruits, leaves, and many aquatic plants, are good pig feeds. It is clear from this that the source of pig feed is very broad.
　　The nutrients required by pigs can be broadly divided into protein, fat, carbohydrates, and minerals. Various green and coarse feeds contain one or several of these nutrients; green feed contains juice, and various nutrients and vitamins are particularly abundant, making it palatable and easily digestible for pigs. Therefore, the notion that only grains can be used to raise pigs well lacks scientific basis. The saying among the masses, "Pigs eat hundreds of grasses," is a scientific summary of practical experience.
　　Here, we provide specific methods for pig feed collection, storage, and processing for local reference.
Storage of Green Feed
　　1. Silage:
　　Choose a site that is dry, has solid soil, and good drainage to dig a rectangular or circular cellar. Compact the walls of the cellar, and coat the bottom with a layer of lime slurry. After it dries, cut the green feed into pieces of about one inch, and load it layer by layer, tamping it down firmly. After filling, cover with a layer of rice straw or weeds, then cover with a foot and a half of soil, forming a bun shape, with drainage ditches around it and a shed above it to shelter it from the rain. Silage can be used one month after ensiling; it can also be stored for a longer period. Silage has the following benefits:
　　(1) It meets epidemic prevention and hygiene requirements and can reduce costs. When feed is ensiled, the green feed is stored in an oxygen-deprived environment. Through the propagation of lactic acid bacteria, sugars in the cell sap are used to produce lactic acid, inhibiting other microorganisms (mainly inhibiting the growth of spoilage bacteria), so it can be stored for a long time. Because the fermentation produces high temperatures and the activity of lactic acid bacteria produces lactic acid, parasite eggs and bacteria have been eliminated, and it can be fed directly to pigs without boiling.
　　(2) It can regulate the surplus and shortage of feed. Store a large amount of green feed when it is available; when green feed is scarce, it can be fully utilized to ensure that there is no shortage of feed in the off-season.
　　(3) It can improve the feed utilization rate. Silage is aromatic and has a sour taste, which can enhance the appetite and digestive ability of pigs, so they are willing to eat and grow well.
　　2. Making Dry Feed:
　　Pea vines, broad bean stalks, and sweet pea, and corn leaves after harvest, can be dried in the sun or hung on hay racks to make hay, then ground into powder or chopped short with a chaff cutter for storage.
Feed Processing and Modulation
　　There are roughly the following methods to turn coarse feed into concentrated feed, improve feed utilization, and increase nutrient content:
　　1. Fermentation Method: The fermentation method includes the following methods:
　　(1) Simple Fermentation Method: Grind wheat bran or rice hulls into powder, add 100 pounds of boiling water to every 120 pounds, stir well, and put it into a jar or fermentation tank to ferment. Wheat bran powder takes five or six days, and rice hull powder takes three or four days.
　　(2) Mixed Fermentation Method: Mix 50 pounds of millet bran powder, 40 pounds of wheat bran powder, and 10 pounds of rice hull powder. Add 100 pounds of boiling water to every 50 or 60 pounds of mixed powder, stir well, and put it into a jar or fermentation tank, tamping it down firmly. It can be mixed with other feeds to feed pigs after three or four days of fermentation.
　　(3) Sugar-Acid Distilling Method: Clean the hulls of buckwheat, naked oats, wheat, millet, etc., stir-fry them dry, crush them, and sieve them into powder. Put them in a large wooden trough, add four and a half times the amount of clean water, and add 24 pounds of bran, distiller's grains, vinegar grains, etc., per 100 pounds of raw material. Mix and stir well, put it into a jar for preliminary fermentation, then add 6 pounds of sugar residue, and seal the mouth of the jar tightly. In about four to six days, it will become sugar-acid fermented feed.
　　(4) Dry Fermented Feed Method: Take the fermented feed out of the jar or fermentation tank, squeeze out the water, and dry it in the sun, and store it in a clean place. When using it, crush the dried feed, soak it in warm water, and you can feed it directly to pigs, or you can mix it with other feeds to feed pigs.
　　2. Alkalization Method: The pods and stalks of many crops (such as pea stalks, broad bean stalks, and dry vines of beans) can be soaked in 1% lime water overnight before use. This method can increase the nutritional value of the feed by half to one time. After the feed is alkalized, the fiber becomes soft, and it also increases calcium, which is very beneficial for pigs. Alkalized feed should be mixed with green feed to feed pigs.
　　3. Grinding Method: Coarse feeds such as peanut shells, cottonseed shells, rice hulls, and bean pods contain a lot of fiber and must be ground before pigs can digest and absorb them, so that coarse feed is fed finely. Barnyard grass used as feed must be ground finer to prevent it from being excreted with the feces and germinating again.
　　4. Steaming and Boiling Method: Green and coarse feeds with large volume and high fiber content should be steamed and boiled to reduce the volume, soften the fiber, increase the aroma, and improve the utilization rate of the feed. At the same time, it can also kill parasite eggs and bacteria and reduce the occurrence of diseases. When steaming and boiling green feed, be careful to cook it thoroughly, or add a small amount of baking soda or lime water to avoid causing feed poisoning. Because under closed steaming conditions, at a temperature of 56 degrees Celsius and a pH of 5.3 to 5.6, hydrocyanic acid will be produced due to the action of enzymes, causing poisoning.
　　5. Stir-frying and Grinding Method: Corn cobs, bean pods, peanut shells, and other feeds can be stir-fried before processing and grinding. This not only makes it easier to grind, but also makes the feed smell fragrant, which is easy to promote the appetite of pigs and easy to digest.
　　6. Distilling Method: Crush corn cobs, rice bran, sorghum husks, vine stalks, dried wild vegetables, and leaves, etc., add five cents of distiller's yeast per 100 pounds, add water and stir well, press tightly in a jar, seal the mouth of the jar tightly with mud, and take it out after ten and a half months. It will have the smell of distiller's grains, which pigs love to eat. If rice bran is used for distilling, add 190 pounds of water to 100 pounds of bran, and seal it in a jar for five to eight days.
　　7. Yellow-Green Hay Modulation Method: Modulating yellow hay and green hay is more effective for fattening pigs than using wheat straw and flax stalks. The method is:
　　(1) Clean and chop the yellow hay and green hay short (the shorter the better), put 5 to 8 pounds in each pot, stir-fry for 15 to 20 minutes, and grind it into crumbs to feed the pigs. When stir-frying, the heat should be even, and it should be stir-fried to a deep yellow color. If it is stir-fried too much, it will have a bitter taste, and if it is stir-fried too little, it will lack the oily aroma, and the pigs will not like to eat it. After stir-frying, store it in a dry place to prevent it from getting wet and becoming difficult to grind.
　　(2) Half an hour before feeding the pigs, soak one pound of grass crumbs in two or three pounds of water, and it can be fed to the pigs after soaking.
　　(3) Using the pot simmering method. Boil the water, pour in the grass crumbs, stirring as you pour, stir well and put it in the pot to simmer for half an hour to an hour, and it will have a strong sweet aroma, which pigs love to eat. If the fermentation method is better, stir the grass crumbs and water evenly, put them in a jar or fermentation tank, and ferment them into a dark brown feed, which will have a sour aroma, which pigs love to eat very much.
　　8. Root and Stem Feed Modulation Method: Yams and feed radishes are called root and stem feeds, which are very good for feeding pigs. If the yams have sprouted, the buds must be removed, washed clean, steamed or boiled before feeding. The remaining water from steaming is poisonous and cannot be used to feed pigs, otherwise it will cause disease and death. Other feeds such as feed radishes, carrots, beets, and feed pumpkins can be chopped and fed raw or cooked, preferably mixed with other feeds.
　　9. Other Feed Modulation Methods:
　　(1) Corn Cob Soup: Crush corn cobs, soak them in boiling water for one or two days, grind them into fine powder, cook them, and cool them before feeding pigs.
　　(2) Radish Residue Soup: Cook the radish residue after boiling sugar and feed it to pigs.
　　(3) Seasoned Flour: Grind dried alfalfa, elm leaves, bean leaves, etc., into flour and mix it with other feeds to feed pigs.
　　(4) Grass Paste: Mix sweet potato vines, sweet potato leaves, and cotton leaves into flour, and boil it into a paste with water, called grass paste, which is very good for feeding pigs after cooling.
　　(5) Stir-Fried Flour: Stir-fry cotton shells until cooked, grind them finely, and feed them to pigs after mixing them with boiling water.
　　The following points must also be paid attention to during processing and modulation.
　　First, no matter what kind of feed, it needs to be removed from sand, soil, etc., and those with a bad smell and rotten ones should also be removed. Various vegetable stalks, stalks, etc. that have been sprayed with pesticides must be washed clean.
　　Second, when loading feed into the jar or fermentation tank, it must be tamped down firmly layer by layer so that the water submerges the feed by one or two inches, isolating the feed from direct contact with the air, so as to avoid spoilage and promote early fermentation of the feed.
　　Third, the rust water of fermented feed is poisonous and should not be fed to pigs; if the feed is too sour, it needs to be washed with clean water before feeding to pigs.
　　Fourth, processing and modulating feed should be done with a variety of feeds in combination.
　　Fifth, fermented feed should be mixed with other feeds, and it should be fed less first and then more, gradually increasing, to prevent sudden large amounts of fermented feed from causing pig diseases. At the same time, add three or four cents of salt per pig to stimulate appetite.
　　Sixth, in order to make the feed ferment faster, 10% of the feed in the jar or fermentation tank should be retained as yeast, which will make the next fermentation faster.
　　Seventh, if the concentration of alkalized straw is too high, it needs to be rinsed with water, otherwise it will cause indigestion and constipation in pigs.

　　猪饲料的收贮和加工
    编者按　猪是杂食性动物，它需要多种多样的营养成分，也具有消化多种饲料的能力。因此，不仅粮食等精饲料，各种农作物加工的副产品，以及野草、野菜、野果、树叶和许多水生植物，也都是很好的猪饲料。由此可见，猪饲料的来源是十分广阔的。
    猪所需要的营养成分，大体上可以分为蛋白质、脂肪、碳水化合物和矿物质等。各种青粗饲料都含有其中一种或几种养分；青饲料含有浆汁，各种养分和维生素也就特别多，猪爱吃，也容易消化。所以那些认为只有用粮食才能喂好猪的说法，是缺乏科学根据的。而群众说“猪吃百样草”，却是对于生活经验的科学总结。
    这里，我们仅就猪饲料的收贮和加工的一些具体作法，提出供各地参考。青饲料的贮藏
    一、青贮饲料：
    选择地势干燥、土质结实和排水良好的地方，挖长方形或圆形的窖。将窖壁四周打紧，窖底涂上一层石灰浆。等干了以后，把青料切成一寸左右，层层装入踩紧。装满后，盖上一层稻草或杂草，再盖一尺五寸厚的土，呈包子形，周围开沟排水，上面搭一草棚遮雨。青贮后一月，便可开窖使用；也可以保存更长的时间。青贮饲料有这样一些好处：
    （1）合乎防疫卫生要求，又可以降低成本。饲料青贮时，是把青料贮藏在缺氧的环境中，通过乳酸菌的繁殖活动过程，利用细胞液中的糖分制造乳酸，抑制其他微生物（主要是抑制了腐败细菌的生长），因而能贮藏较久。由于发酵产生了高温，乳酸菌的活动产生了乳酸，因此寄生虫卵细菌等已被消灭，不需煮沸就可直接喂猪。
    （2）可调节饲料余缺。有青料时，大量贮藏；缺青料时就可以充分运用，保证淡季饲料不缺。
    （3）可提高饲料利用率。青贮料味道芳香，带酸味，能增强猪的食欲和消化能力，猪肯吃肯长。
    二、制成干饲料：
    豌豆藤蔓和胡豆秆、苕子，收获后的玉米叶等，可采取晒干和挂在干草架上晾干制成干草，然后再打成粉末或用铡刀切短，收藏备用。
    饲料的加工和调制
    把粗料变精，提高饲料的利用率，增加营养成分，方法大体有以下几种：
    1、发酵法：发酵法包括下面几种作法：
    （一）简单发酵法：把麦壳或谷壳磨成粉，每一百二十斤中兑开水一百斤，搅匀放入缸内或发酵池内发酵，麦壳粉经过五六天，谷壳粉经过三四天就行了。
    （二）混合发酵法：把五十斤糜壳粉、四十斤麦壳粉和十斤谷壳粉混合起来，每五六十斤混合粉兑开水一百斤，搅匀放入缸内或发酵池内踩实压紧，发酵三四天后就可以和其他饲料掺和喂猪。
    （三）糖酸变糟法：把荞麦、莜麦、小麦、谷子等壳子弄干净、炒干、压碎、箩成粉，放在大木槽内，兑清水四倍半，每百斤原料中加入二十四斤糠麸、酒糟、醋糟等，混合搅匀装入缸内，初步发酵后再加入六斤糖渣，盖严缸口，大约有四至六天，就会变成糖酸发酵饲料。
    （四）发酵饲料干制法：把发酵好的饲料从缸内或发酵池内取出来，挤干水分晒干，放在干净地方保存好。用的时候把饲料干打碎，放在温水里泡透，就能直接喂猪，也可以掺和其他饲料喂猪。
    2、碱化法：许多农作物的荚壳和秸秆（如豌豆秆、胡豆秆、豆类的干藤蔓等），都可以放在1％的石灰水里，浸泡一昼夜后，捞出使用。这种方法能使饲料的营养价值提高半倍到一倍；饲料碱化以后，纤维变软，也增加了钙质，猪吃了很有好处。碱化饲料，应该和青料混合喂猪。
    3、磨碎法：花生壳、棉子壳、谷壳、豆类的荚壳等粗饲料含纤维多，要经过磨碎，猪才能消化吸收，做到粗料细喂。稗子作饲料，更要磨细，免随粪便排出，再度发芽。
    4、蒸煮法：凡是体积大、含纤维多的青粗饲料，都宜用蒸煮的办法，缩小体积，使纤维变软，增加香味，提高饲料的利用率；同时，还可以杀死寄生虫卵和细菌，减少疫病发生。蒸煮青饲料时，要注意煮熟，或加少量小苏打、石灰水，可避免引起饲料中毒。因为，在密闭蒸煮的条件下，温度摄氏五十六度、酸碱度五点三至五点六时，由于酶的作用，会产生氰氢酸引起中毒。
    5、炒碾法：玉米心、豆类荚壳、花生壳等饲料，可先炒了以后，再加工磨碎。这样，不仅容易磨碎，而且饲料的气味香，容易促进猪的食欲，也容易消化。
    6、变糟法：把玉米轴、谷糠、高粱壳、秧蔓、干野菜和树叶等，一起碾碎，每百斤加五钱酒麯，兑水搅匀后，紧压在缸内，用泥把缸口糊严，十天半月后取出来，就带有酒糟味，猪很爱吃。如果用谷糠变糟，一百斤糠兑水一百九十斤，在缸内密封五天至八天就行了。
    7、黄青干草调制法：把黄干草和青干草调制好，比用麦秸、胡麻秆喂猪更肯上膘。办法是：
  （一）把黄干草和青干草弄净切短（越短越好），每锅放五至八斤，炒十五分至二十分钟，磨成碎面，就能喂猪。炒的时候火要匀，炒到深黄色就行了。炒焦了有苦味，炒嫩了缺乏油香味，猪都不爱吃。炒好后，存放在干燥的地方，防止潮湿了磨不烂。
    （二）在喂猪的前半小时，把一斤草面泡在二三斤水中，泡好就能喂猪。
    （三）用锅焖法。把水烧开，倒入草面，随倒随搅，搅匀后放在锅内焖半小时至一小时，就有强烈的甜香味，猪很爱吃。如果用发酵法更好，把草面和水搅匀，放入缸内或发酵池内，发酵成深褐色的饲料，就有一股酸香味，猪非常爱吃。
    8、根茎饲料调制法：山药蛋和饲料萝卜等，都叫根茎饲料，喂猪很好。如果是发芽的山药蛋，必须去掉芽子，洗干净，蒸熟或煮熟喂。蒸熟的残水败汤里面有毒，不能喂猪，否则引起疾病，造成死亡。其他如饲料萝卜、胡萝卜、甜菜、饲料南瓜等，切碎后生喂熟喂都行，最好和其他的饲料掺和起来喂。
    9、其他饲料调制法：
    （一）玉米轴汤：把玉米轴打碎，用开水泡一两天，碾成细末煮熟，晾冷喂猪。
    （二）萝卜渣汤：把熬糖后的萝卜渣，煮熟后喂猪。
    （三）调和面：把干苜蓿、榆叶、豆叶等碾成面和其他饲料掺和喂猪。
    （四）草酱：把薯蔓、薯叶和棉叶混合碾成面，用水熬成糊糊，叫草酱，晾冷喂猪挺好。
    （五）炒面：把棉花壳炒熟碾细，用开水冲后喂猪。
    在加工调制的时候，还必须注意以下几件事。
    第一，不管哪种饲料，都需要除去沙子、泥土等，带臭味和腐烂了的也要去掉，洒过农药的各种菜帮、秸秆等必须洗净。
    第二，往缸内或发酵池内装饲料时，必须分层踩实压紧，使水淹住饲料一二寸，隔绝饲料和空气的直接接触，才能避免腐烂，促使饲料早发酵。
    第三，发酵饲料的锈水，里面有毒，不可喂猪；如果饲料太酸，还需要用清水洗一下再喂猪。
    第四，加工调制饲料，应多种饲料搭配。
    第五，发酵饲料要与其他饲料混合喂，并要先少喂后多喂，逐渐增加，防止突然大量吃发酵饲料，引起猪病。同时，按每头猪加三四钱食盐刺激食欲。
    第六，为了使饲料发酵得更快，缸内或发酵池内的饲料，应留10％作酵母，下次再发酵就快了。
    第七，碱化的秸秆等，如果浓度太大，需要用水冲洗，否则会引起猪的消化不良，发生便泌。
