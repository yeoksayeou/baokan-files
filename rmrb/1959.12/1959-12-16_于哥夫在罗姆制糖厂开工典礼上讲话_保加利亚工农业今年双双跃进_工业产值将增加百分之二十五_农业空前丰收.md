Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 14th: Bulgarian Minister of the Council Chairman Yugov said on the 13th that thanks to the heroic labor of Bulgarian workers, engineering and technical personnel, and agricultural cooperative members, Bulgaria has achieved a genuine leap forward in developing the national economy this year.

　　He said that according to preliminary statistics, Bulgaria's industrial output value this year will increase by about 25% compared to last year. Although the climatic conditions this year were not good, the harvest of agricultural products was more than any previous year.

　　Yugov made these remarks at the opening ceremony of a newly built modern sugar factory in Bulgaria, the Rom Sugar Factory.

　　Yugov said that these achievements in developing the national economy in Bulgaria once again prove the great superiority of the socialist system, prove the trust and unlimited loyalty of the Bulgarian working people to the Bulgarian Communist Party, and prove the correctness of the party's line of accelerating economic development.

　　In his speech, Yugov also talked about the current international situation. He pointed out that thanks to the peace-loving policy of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries and Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States, the international situation has begun to ease. The people of all countries approve of the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament because they believe that this is a prerequisite for consolidating world peace and the peaceful coexistence of the two social systems. Yugov then said, of course, we know that the most stubborn "Cold War" elements will continue to adhere to the "Cold War" and hinder the victory of the cause of peace, friendship, and understanding among the people of all countries. However, we firmly believe that it is possible and necessary to destroy the stubborn resistance of these warmongers. The powerful socialist forces and the people of all countries will certainly be able to stop the "Cold War" elements.

　　In his speech, Yugov reiterated Bulgaria's good-neighborly policy and sincere desire to improve relations with Greece and Turkey.

　　The Rom Sugar Factory is built near Rom City in the Mikhailovgrad Oblast and is one of the most modern factories in Bulgaria. This factory was designed with the help of the German Democratic Republic, and the main machines and equipment of the factory are also supplied by the German Democratic Republic. The entire production process of the factory is mechanized and automated, and it can process 1,200 tons of sugar beets per day, with an annual output of more than 27,000 tons of sugar.

    于哥夫在罗姆制糖厂开工典礼上讲话
  　保加利亚工农业今年双双跃进
    工业产值将增加百分之二十五  农业空前丰收
    新华社索非亚14日电　保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫13日说，由于保加利亚工人、工程技术人员和农业合作社社员的英雄劳动，今年保加利亚在发展国民经济方面实现了一个真正的跃进。
    他说，据初步统计，今年保加利亚的工业产值将比去年增加约25％。虽然今年的气候条件不好，但是，农产品的收获量却比过去任何一年都多。
    于哥夫是在保加利亚新近建成的一座现代化制糖厂——罗姆制糖厂的开工典礼上讲话时说这番话的。
    于哥夫说，保加利亚在发展国民经济方面取得的这些成就，再次证明了社会主义制度的巨大优越性，证明了保加利亚劳动人民对保加利亚共产党的信任和无限忠诚，证明了党所制订的加速经济发展的路线的正确。
    于哥夫在讲话中还谈到了目前国际局势。他指出，由于苏联和所有社会主义国家的爱好和平政策和赫鲁晓夫同志在美国的访问，国际局势开始趋向缓和。各国人民赞同苏联提出的全面彻底裁军建议，因为他们认为这是巩固世界和平和两个社会体系的和平共处的前提条件。于哥夫接着说，当然，我们知道，最顽固的“冷战”分子将继续坚持“冷战”，阻挠各国人民间和平、友谊和谅解事业的胜利。但是，我们坚信，一定能够，而且必须摧毁这些战争狂人的顽抗。强大的社会主义力量和世界各国人民一定能够制止“冷战”分子。
    于哥夫在讲话中再次重申了保加利亚的睦邻政策和改善与希腊、土耳其关系的真诚愿望。
    罗姆制糖厂建立在米哈伊洛夫格勒州罗姆市附近，是保加利亚最现代化的工厂之一。这座工厂由德意志民主共和国帮助设计，工厂的主要机器和设备也是由德意志民主共和国供给的。工厂的整个生产过程都实行机械化和自动化，每昼夜可以加工一千二百吨甜菜，年产砂糖二万七千吨以上。
