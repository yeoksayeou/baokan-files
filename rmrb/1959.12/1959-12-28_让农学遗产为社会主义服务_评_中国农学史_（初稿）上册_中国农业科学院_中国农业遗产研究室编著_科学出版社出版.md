　　Let Agricultural Heritage Serve Socialism
    Review of "A History of Chinese Agricultural Science" (Draft), Volume 1

    Our hardworking and wise farmers have created and accumulated a very rich wealth of agricultural production experience in thousands of years of production struggle. Some of these experiences are still used by farmers today and have played a positive role in the great leap forward in agricultural production. However, some good experiences have not been promoted due to historical limitations, and have even been ignored and forgotten.
    Some ancient agronomists in our country once summarized the production experience of contemporary and previous farmers and wrote some agricultural books, which are all very precious agricultural heritage. However, due to the limitations of historical and class conditions, their works cannot be completely scientific. Before and after the "May Fourth" Movement, the "national essence" that some "national essence-ists" tried to maintain was actually the dross of feudalism; and some bourgeois scientists only worshiped the West, both despising the production practice experience of our country's farmers and ignoring the historical heritage of the motherland. It was impossible for them to scientifically summarize our country's agricultural heritage.
    Therefore, our scientific workers today must follow the instructions of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and use the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method to sort out and study the precious heritage of the motherland, including agricultural heritage, critically re-summarize it, and make it better serve current politics and production. The recently published "A History of Chinese Agricultural Science" (Draft), Volume 1, is an achievement in scientifically summarizing our country's agricultural heritage in accordance with the instructions of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and under the direct leadership of the Party, relying on collective strength, and with a leap forward spirit.
    Based on ancient agricultural books or books related to agricultural records, this book comprehensively analyzes the origin and development process of various agricultural production technologies and agricultural science in our country. The first volume starts with the invention of primitive agriculture in our country, and describes the origin, evolution, and innovation of various agricultural production technologies, up to the development situation reflected in the "Qi Min Yao Shu" in the late Northern Wei Dynasty (the turn of the fifth and sixth centuries AD). It is divided into nine chapters, with about 300,000 words.
    In describing the development of agricultural production, this book emphasizes that every invention and development of new technologies is the creation of the masses of farmers in their production practice, and does not obliterate the contributions of ancient agronomists. The content, scientific principles, and role in production practice of ancient major agricultural works are all analyzed or criticized in detail based on the historical background in which each book was produced, the author's stand, viewpoint, and its historical and class limitations. Generally speaking, this aspect is written relatively well. At the same time, the book also focuses on exploring the development process and laws of agricultural production technology and agricultural science in ancient China. However, it is more detailed and clear in discussing the development process; while it is relatively poor in explaining the regularity. In addition, when analyzing the development process of agricultural production technology, it is discussed in connection with the socio-economic conditions at that time.
    In the discussion of each chapter, this book also strives to analyze in connection with the actual situation of current agricultural production science. For example, this is how it is done in Chapter 6, which discusses "The Crop Cultivation Principles and High-Yield Methods in the 'Fan Shengzhi Shu'" and Chapter 9, which discusses "The Development of the 'Qi Min Yao Shu' in Crop Cultivation Principles." Moreover, the book also criticized the reactionary theories of bourgeois scholars' "law of diminishing returns" and "population theory."
    Regarding the evolution of ancient Chinese farm tools, the construction and utilization of water conservancy and irrigation projects, the invention, application, effectiveness, and improvement of various agricultural production technologies, etc., this book makes a more comprehensive and detailed discussion on the time, region, and conditions of their emergence and development. This aspect is written relatively well, and a lot of effort has been put into it. From a certain perspective, this "A History of Chinese Agricultural Science" is also a history of the development of Chinese farm tools and agricultural production technology. At present, the compilation and teaching of general histories of China generally have relatively brief discussions on agricultural productivity, which is a major shortcoming. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Since the existence of class society, there are only two kinds of knowledge in the world, one is called knowledge of the struggle for production; the other is called knowledge of the class struggle." Therefore, only knowing the historical knowledge of class struggle, but not knowing the historical knowledge of the struggle for production, one cannot understand the whole picture of history. Moreover, productive forces and relations of production are two closely interdependent aspects. Without understanding the development of productive forces in history, it is difficult to deeply study the development of relations of production at that time. The publication of "A History of Chinese Agricultural Science" will partially remedy the above shortcomings.
    This book certainly has shortcomings. The main ones are: the focus of discussion is not prominent in many chapters, some arguments are too far from the theme, and inevitably become cumbersome, and so on. For example, in the first section of Chapter 7, it is necessary to refer to the era of the "Classic of Mountains and Seas," but it is not necessary to cite a lot of historical data to prove that the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" is a geographical book. For another example, in the first section of Chapter 9, it is necessary to emphasize the landlord class position of Jia Sixie, the author of "Qi Min Yao Shu," but it is not necessary to repeatedly argue, because Jia Sixie's class position is relatively clear and will not cause any doubts and disputes. On the other hand, it is also inappropriate that the book does not affirm the positive role played by his compilation of the "Qi Min Yao Shu" after emphasizing Jia Sixie's class position.
    In terms of the use of terms and concepts in political economy, there are also some inaccuracies or improprieties in the book. For example, the way of obtaining means of subsistence is the way of producing material means, but when discussing the "way of obtaining means of subsistence in the Book of Songs era" in the third section of Chapter 2, it only lists what people ate and wore at that time to prove the diversity of production items. This does not conform to the actual content of the concept of the mode of production. For another example, in Chapters 2 and 3, it is generally emphasized that the individual economy is superior to the collective economy, without specific analysis from the perspective of the transformation of production relations, and without discussing the historical progressiveness and historical inevitability of the relationship of the then peasant individual economy (whether it is free small peasants or tenant farmers) compared to the original clan commune or rural commune relationship, which is very inappropriate.
    The second section of Chapter 5 says that the decisive factor in promoting the development of agricultural productivity in the early Former Han Dynasty "lies in a stratum of middle-class or middle-class people, they are small and medium-sized landlords, and they are also producers or personally guide the producers." This is an obvious theoretical error. Because, the landlord class, no matter how big or small, is an exploiter who does not work for a living, not a producer; and although the feudal economy at that time was a progressive mode of production, the decisive factor in promoting the development of agricultural productivity was by no means the small and medium-sized landlord class, but the peasant labor masses and their class struggle and production struggle. As for the general shortcomings or inadequacies of the book in applying the principles of historical materialism, one is that the regularity of the development of agricultural production technology is not clear and not prominent; the other is that when describing the economic conditions of various eras in conjunction, it is more prone to general discussions, and rarely further analyzes the dialectical relationship of mutual dependence and mutual influence between production relations and agricultural productivity (including farm tools and production technology, etc.), and even less discusses how the class struggle at that time played a huge historical role in promoting the development of agricultural productivity.

　　让农学遗产为社会主义服务
    评“中国农学史”（初稿）上册

    我国勤劳而智慧的农民在几千年生产斗争的实践中，创造了并积累了非常丰富的农业生产经验。其中有些经验到今天仍为农民所沿用，并在农业生产大跃进中起了积极的作用。但是，也有些好经验因历史条件的限制而未能推广，甚至被忽视和遗忘。
    我国古代有些农学家，曾经总结当代及其以前的农民生产经验，写过一些农学著作，这些都是很可珍贵的农学遗产。但是，毕竟由于历史条件和阶级条件的限制，他们的著作不可能完全合乎科学。“五四”前后，一些“国粹主义”者极力维护的“国粹”，其实只是封建主义的糟粕；而一些资产阶级科学家又只崇拜西方，既轻视我国农民的生产实践的经验，也漠视祖国的历史遗产。他们都不可能对我国的农学遗产进行科学的总结。
    因此，我们今天的科学工作者，就必须遵照党和毛泽东同志的指示，以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，对祖国历史的珍贵遗产，其中包括农学遗产，进行整理研究，批判地给以再总结，使其更好地为当前的政治和生产服务。最近出版的“中国农学史”（初稿）上册，就是遵照党和毛泽东同志的指示，并在党的直接领导之下，靠集体力量，以跃进精神，科学地总结我国农学遗产的一个成果。
    这本书根据古代农书或有关农事记载的书籍，比较全面地分析了我国各种农业生产技术和农学的起源及其发展过程。上册从我国原始农耕的发明起，中述各方面农业生产技术的起源、演变及其革新，到“齐民要术”所反映的北魏末期（公元五、六世纪之交）的发展情况为止，共分九章，约三十余万字。
    本书在叙述农业生产的发展中，对于每一新技术的发明和发展，既强调它们是历代农民群众在生产实践中的创造，也不抹煞古代农学家的贡献。对古代的主要农学著作的内容、科学原理及其对生产实践的作用等等，都就各书产生的时代背景，作者的立场、观点及其历史的和阶级的局限性，进行了比较详细的分析或批判。一般地说，这一方面写得比较好。同时，书中也着重探讨了我国古代农业生产技术和农学的发展过程及其规律。不过，在论述发展过程方面，比较详细和明晰；而在阐明规律性方面，却比较差些。此外，在分析农业生产技术的发展过程时，都联系当时的社会经济状况作了论述。
    本书在各章的论述中，也努力联系当前农业生产科学的实际进行分析。例如，在第六章论述“氾胜之书的作物栽培原理和丰产方法”和第九章论述“齐民要术在作物栽培原理上的发展”时，都是这样做的。并且书中还对资产阶级学者的“土地报酬递减律”和“人口论”的反动学说作了批判。
    关于我国古代农具的演变，水利灌溉工程的建设和利用，各种农业生产技术的发明、应用、成效及其改进的情况等等，本书都就其产生和发展的时间、地区和条件等方面，作了比较全面而详细的论述。这方面写得比较好，费的功夫也很大。就某一角度说，这本“中国农学史”又是一本中国农具和农业生产技术的发展史。目前，关于中国通史的编写和讲授，一般对于农业生产力方面的论述，都比较简略，这是一大缺憾。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“自从有阶级的社会存在以来，世界上的知识只有两门，一门叫做生产斗争知识；一门叫做阶级斗争知识。”因此，只知道阶级斗争的历史知识，而不知道生产斗争的历史知识，便不能了解历史的全貌。而且，生产力和生产关系是密切地相互依赖着的两个方面，不了解历史上生产力的发展状况，便很难深入研究当时生产关系的发展状况。“中国农学史”的出版，将能部分地补救上述的缺点。
    这本书当然也有缺点。主要的是：很多章节中论述的重点不突出，有些论证离开主题太远，不免流于繁琐等等。例如，在第七章第一节中，参证“山海经”一书的著作时代是必要的，但是引用不少史料来论证“山海经”是地理类书籍便不必要了。又如，在第九章第一节中强调“齐民要术”作者贾思勰的地主阶级立场是必要的，但是用不着加以反复的论证，因为贾思勰的阶级立场较为明显，不会引起什么疑问和争论。另一方面，书中在强调贾思勰的阶级立场之后，没有肯定他编著“齐民要术”一书所起的积极作用，也不妥当。
    在运用政治经济学的名词概念方面，书中也有不谨严或欠妥之处。例如，生活资料谋取方式就是物质资料生产方式，而第二章第三节论述“诗经时代生活资料谋取方式”时，只是列举那时人们吃的什么、穿的什么，来论证生产项目的多样性，这和生产方式这一概念的实际内容不相符合。又如，在第二章和第三章中，笼统地强调个体经济比集体经济优越，而没有从生产关系的变革方面进行具体分析，没有从当时农民个体经济的关系（无论是自由小农或佃农）比原始氏族公社或农村公社关系具有历史的进步性和历史发展的必然性方面加以论述，这是很不妥当的。
    第五章第二节中说推动前汉初期农业生产力发展的决定因素，“在于一部分中家或中民这一阶层，他们是中小地主阶级，同时又是生产者或亲自指导生产者”。这是理论方面的明显错误。因为，地主阶级不论大中小，都是不劳而获的剥削者，不是生产者；而当时的封建经济虽然是进步的生产方式，但是推动农业生产力发展的决定因素，也绝不是中小地主阶级，而是农民劳动群众及其所进行的阶级斗争和生产斗争。至于书中在运用历史唯物主义原理方面的一般缺点或不足之处，一是阐明农业生产技术发展的规律性不明确，不突出；一是在连带叙述各个时代的经济状况时，多流于一般的论述，很少从生产关系和农业生产力（包括农具和生产技术等）的相互依赖互为影响的辩证关系作进一步的分析，更没有论述当时阶级斗争如何起着推动农业生产力发展的巨大历史作用。
