Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 19th. The Shenyang Fan Factory, a red banner unit honored at the National Conference of Heroes, has comprehensively completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule. As of the 15th, the total output value plan was fulfilled by 108%, the product output plan by 116%, the variety plan by 100%, the labor productivity plan by 103%, the product qualification rate reached 100%, the product cost was reduced by 19% compared to the plan, and profits turned over to the state were fulfilled by 102%.

In achieving this year's comprehensive leap forward, the factory adhered to putting politics in command and vigorously launched mass movements, thus exceeding the production plan in every quarter.

The factory's fourth-quarter plan increased by 14.88% compared to the actual third quarter, mainly focusing on manufacturing blowers with complex structures, high technical requirements, and high labor consumption, such as blowers, power station induced draft fans, and mine fans. Among them, the annual plan for large precision blowers was ninety-seven units, with over 52% needing to be completed in the fourth quarter. The annual plan for large axial flow fans was two hundred and ninety units, with 46% needing to be completed in the fourth quarter. However, the factory's main equipment capacity was lacking by more than 20%, and the technical workforce was also insufficient. In response to this situation, the factory's Party committee timely informed the entire factory's workers and masses of the situation, tasks, and key points, pointing out that whether these key products could be completed on time would directly affect the continued leap forward of eighty-one key enterprises in metallurgy, coal mines, and power stations next year, thereby strengthening the determination of all employees to overcome difficulties. At the same time, the factory Party committee also timely organized workers to study the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in carrying out technical performance competitions, the experience of Shenyang Water Pump Factory in implementing technical innovation support, and the experience of the transformer factory in promoting advanced producer service teams, and launched a "long-term goal, short-distance race." The practice of this competition is: under the overall goal of the whole month, requirements are put forward by ten-day periods, and well-prepared and purposeful technical performance competitions are carried out for three to five days. After summarizing, evaluating, coordinating, and exchanging, a second technical performance competition is organized, ensuring that production is red every ten days and rising step by step.

    沈阳扇风机厂夺得全胜迎新年  产量质量品种成本样样都跃进
    新华社沈阳19日电　荣获全国群英会红旗单位称号的沈阳扇风机厂，提前全面完成了全年生产计划。到15日为止，总产值计划完成108％，产品产量计划完成116％，品种计划完成100％，劳动生产率计划完成103％，产品合格率达到100％，产品成本比计划降低19％，上缴利润完成102％。
    这个厂在实现今年的全面跃进中，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，因而每个季度都超额完成了生产计划。
    这个厂第四季度计划比第三季度实际提高14.88％，主要是制造结构复杂、技术要求高和耗费工时多的鼓风机，电站鼓引风机，矿井风机；其中，大型精密的鼓风机全年计划生产九十七台，有52％以上需要在四季度内完成，全年计划生产二百九十台大型轴流通风机，有46％需要在四季度内完成。但是，厂里的主要设备能力缺少20％以上，技工能力也不足。厂党委针对这种情况，适时地向全厂职工群众交形势、交任务、交关键，指出这些重点产品能否按时完成，对冶金、煤矿和电站等八十一个重点企业明年继续跃进有直接影响，从而坚定了全体职工战胜困难的决心。同时，厂党委又及时组织职工学习了鞍钢大搞技术表演赛的经验，沈阳水泵厂搞技术革新配套的经验，以及变压器厂推行先进生产者服务队的经验，开展了“长目标短途赛”。这种竞赛的做法是：在全月总目标下，分旬提出要求，有准备、有目的地开展为期三天到五天的技术表演赛，经过总结、评比、配套、交流后，再组织第二次技术表演赛，保证了生产旬旬红、步步高。
