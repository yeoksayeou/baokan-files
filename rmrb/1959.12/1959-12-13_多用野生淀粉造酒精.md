    Use More Wild Starch to Make Alcohol
    This year, the nation's wild starch raw materials have had an unprecedented bumper harvest. Up to now, the commercial departments have purchased one and a half times more various wild starch raw materials than last year. And now, the "small autumn harvest" movement in most areas has not yet ended, and it is expected that by the end of the year, the harvest of wild starch raw materials will have an even greater increase.
    With the bumper harvest of wild starch raw materials, how to better process and utilize them has become a very important issue at present. Wild starch raw materials can be used to make various non-staple foods, various pastries, slurries, glucose, maltose, can be used to brew white wine and distill alcohol, and the remaining residue can also be used as feed. In short, wild starch has many uses, and many things processed from grain can be replaced by wild starch raw materials. Since the uses of wild starch raw materials are so wide and the output is so large, where is it more appropriate to use them? From an economic point of view, using starch to make white wine and distilled alcohol is much more valuable than using starch raw materials to make non-staple foods. In the past, most alcohol was made from grain. If wild starch raw materials are processed into white wine, and then the white wine is distilled into alcohol, and then the alcohol is used to make synthetic rubber, the economic value is even greater. Because rubber is an indispensable chemical raw material for many national economic sectors. It is needed to produce rubber shoes and rain boots, to produce various tires, and for transmission belts, V-belts, and various rubber tubes used on machines. About five tons of alcohol can make one ton of butadiene-styrene rubber. If all the wild starch raw materials that the commercial departments have already purchased are made into alcohol, and these alcohol is used to make rubber, it will strongly support socialist construction.
    Of course, using wild starch raw materials to brew alcohol, compared to using it to make various non-staple foods and feed, requires solving some equipment and technical problems. However, some problems are not difficult to solve. Brewing white wine can be completely done by the people's communes using indigenous methods and indigenous equipment on the spot. Our country has always had the habit of brewing wine in rural areas. In November this year, the people of all ethnic groups in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture used indigenous methods to turn more than 5 million dan of wild raw materials into more than 19 million jin of starch, white wine, etc. In order to promote the development of the brewing industry in people's communes in various places, commercial departments should help the people's communes with equipment and technology, and actively sign purchase contracts with the people's communes to give full play to the superiority of the people's communes.
    The utilization of wild raw materials must be considered from economic and political aspects. If used properly, it will not only increase the income of communes and commune members, improve the lives of commune members, but also better support national construction. If used improperly, it will not only cause economic waste, but also damage the enthusiasm of the vast number of collectors politically. It is hoped that all localities will actively provide guidance so that the fruits already in hand can give full play to their role.

### 多用野生淀粉造酒精

    多用野生淀粉造酒精
    今年全国的野生淀粉原料获得了空前的大丰收。到目前为止，商业部门已收购的各种野生淀粉原料比去年多一倍半，而现在绝大部分地区的“小秋收”运动还没有结束，预计到年底，野生淀粉原料的收获量，还会有更大的增加。
    野生淀粉原料丰收了，如何更好地加工利用，就成为当前十分重要的问题。野生淀粉原料可以做各种副食品，做各种点心，浆料、葡萄糖、饴糖，可以酿白酒和蒸馏酒精，剩下来的渣子，还可以做饲料。总之，野生淀粉用途很大，很多用粮食加工的东西，都可用野生淀粉原料来顶替。野生淀粉原料的用途既然这样广泛，产量又是那么多，究竟用到哪里才算比较得当呢？从经济意义上来讲，把淀粉用来做白酒和蒸馏酒精，要比用淀粉原料做副食品价值大得多。过去大部分酒精都是用粮食来做，如果用野生淀粉原料加工成白酒，再用白酒蒸馏成酒精，再用酒精做合成橡胶，经济价值更大。因为橡胶是很多国民经济部门不可缺少的化工原料，生产胶鞋、雨鞋需要它，生产各种轮胎需要它，机器上用的传动带、三角带、各种胶管也需要它。大约每五吨左右的酒精就可以制一吨丁钠橡胶。如果把商业部门已经收购的野生淀粉原料都做成酒精，并且用这些酒精制成橡胶，就有力地支援了社会主义建设。
    当然，用野生淀粉原料酿造酒精，比用来做各种副食品和饲料，需要解决一些设备和技术问题。但是，有些问题不难解决。酿造白酒完全可以由人民公社用土办法、土设备就地加工。我国农村历来就有酿酒的习惯。今年11月份，黔东南苗族侗族自治州各族人民，利用土办法，把五百多万担野生原料制出淀粉、白酒等一千九百多万斤。为了促进各地人民公社酿酒工业的发展，商业部门应该从设备和技术上帮助人民公社，并且积极和人民公社订收购合同，充分发挥人民公社的优越性。
    野生原料的利用，必须从经济、政治各方面去考虑，利用得当，既增加了公社和社员的收入，改善了社员的生活，还可以更好地支援国家建设。利用不当，不仅在经济上造成浪费，政治上也会损伤广大采集人员的积极性。希望各地积极辅导，让已经到手的果实充分发挥它的作用。
