    CPC Central Committee Congratulates Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Congress
    A New Starting Point for Accelerating Hungary's Socialist Construction

    (Dispatch from our newspaper) The congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party was read by Tan Zhenlin, head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, at the congress. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

To the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party,
Dear Comrade Delegates:

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all Communist Party members and the entire Chinese people, extends warm and fraternal congratulations to the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and expresses sincere and heartfelt respect to the glorious Hungarian working class and the Hungarian people through the congress.

    The Hungarian working class and Hungarian communists have a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Hungarian working class, with the communists as its core, united the Hungarian working people and waged a long-term struggle to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat and realize socialism, writing a glorious page in the history of the Hungarian revolution and the international workers' movement. Since liberation, Hungarian communists have led the Hungarian people to overcome many difficulties on the road forward, advancing along the bright road of socialism. In 1956, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government headed by Comrade Kádár, and with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and the support of progressive forces worldwide, the Hungarian people repelled the attacks of imperialism and domestic counter-revolution, defending the socialist cause of the Hungarian people.

    The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is the successor to the revolutionary traditions of the Hungarian working class and communists. For the past three years, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and guided by the Party's correct line, the Hungarian working class and working people have steadfastly consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, rapidly restored the national economy, and continued to develop socialist economic construction and cultural construction at an even higher speed. At the same time, you have waged arduous and victorious struggles on the ideological and political fronts and have also achieved great success in the socialist transformation of agriculture. All these victories and achievements make the Chinese communists and the Chinese people feel happy and encouraged.

    The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, loyal to socialist patriotism and proletarian internationalism, and is making effective efforts to defend and develop the socialist cause of the Hungarian people. All of this has united the Hungarian people more and more closely around the Party. The convening of your congress this time, on the basis of summarizing the experiences of fourteen years of revolution and construction and formulating the basic tasks of socialist construction in the future, will surely become a new starting point for further mobilizing the people of Hungary to strive to accelerate socialist construction. This congress will make new contributions to the development of the socialist cause of the Hungarian people, to the strengthening of the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the struggle of the people of the world to defend world peace.

    The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have always regarded the great achievements made by the fraternal Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian people in the cause of socialist construction as their own achievements. The people of China and Hungary have established a deep friendship in the struggle for a common cause, and this fraternal friendship will continue to be consolidated and developed. Our two peoples are united with the great Soviet people and the people of other socialist brother countries, advancing side by side and fighting together, and our common cause will be ever victorious.

    We wish the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party a complete success!
                            The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                      　November 29, 1959

    中共中央祝贺匈牙利社会主义工人党代表大会
    加速匈社会主义建设的新起点
    本报讯　中国共产党中央委员会给匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会的贺电，已由中国共产党代表团团长谭震林在会上宣读。贺电全文如下：匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会亲爱的代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表全体中国共产党党员和全体中国人民，向匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺，并且通过大会向光荣的匈牙利工人阶级和匈牙利人民表示衷心的诚挚的敬意。
    匈牙利工人阶级和匈牙利共产党人有光荣的革命传统。匈牙利工人阶级以共产党人为核心，团结匈牙利劳动人民，为建立无产阶级专政、实现社会主义而进行了长期的斗争，在匈牙利革命和国际工人运动历史上写下了光辉的篇页。解放以来，匈牙利共产党人领导匈牙利人民克服了前进道路上的许多困难，沿着社会主义的光明大道前进。在1956年，匈牙利人民在以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，在苏联的兄弟般的援助和全世界进步力量的支持下，击退了帝国主义和国内反革命的进攻，保卫了匈牙利人民的社会主义事业。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党是匈牙利工人阶级和共产党人的革命传统的继承者。三年来，匈牙利工人阶级和劳动人民在匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下，在党的正确路线的指引下，坚定地巩固了无产阶级专政，迅速地恢复了国民经济，并且以更高的速度继续发展着社会主义经济建设和文化建设。在这同时，你们在思想战线和政治战线上进行了艰巨而胜利的斗争，在农业的社会主义改造方面也取得了巨大成就。所有这些胜利和成就，都使中国共产党人和中国人民感到高兴和鼓舞。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党忠于马克思列宁主义原则，忠于社会主义爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义，为捍卫和发展匈牙利人民的社会主义事业进行着成效卓著的努力，这一切已经把匈牙利人民越来越紧密地团结在党的周围。你们这一次代表大会的召开，在总结十四年来革命和建设的经验的基础上制定今后社会主义建设的基本任务，必将成为进一步动员匈牙利全国人民为加速社会主义建设而奋斗的新的起点。这次大会，对于发展匈牙利人民的社会主义事业，对于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力，对于全世界人民保卫世界和平的斗争，都将作出新的贡献。
    中国共产党和中国人民对于兄弟的匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利人民在社会主义建设事业中所取得的伟大成就，从来就看做是自己的成就。中匈两国人民在为共同事业的斗争中建立了深厚的友谊，这种兄弟友谊必将继续巩固和发展。我们两国人民同伟大的苏联人民和其他社会主义兄弟国家人民团结在一起，并肩前进，共同奋斗，我们的共同事业将无往而不胜利。
    祝匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会圆满成功！
                           中国共产党中央委员会
                      　一九五九年十一月二十九日
