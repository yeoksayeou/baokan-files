　　Sowing the Seeds of Spring
    Our country's young film projection industry has experienced unprecedented development in the past decade. Currently, the projection teams have spread throughout urban and rural areas of the country, becoming a vital force in popularizing culture.
    Film projection work is one of the most powerful, important, and popular propaganda weapons for popularizing cultural education. Through film projection, many films with educational significance are having a great impact on the broad masses. In fact, projection teams are using the fastest method to sow the seeds of spring to hundreds of millions of peasants. The Party's call, communist ideology, the creations of the masses, and the latest achievements of socialist construction are all spread to every mountain village through the hard work of small film projection teams, allowing the spring breeze of socialist construction in our country to blow through every corner. What a significant role film projection teams play in raising the socialist consciousness of the masses, conducting patriotic and internationalist education, inspiring the masses' enthusiasm for production, and promoting the development of production!
    From the very beginning, the film projection network of New China has resolutely implemented the literary and art policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving politics and production. The vast majority of film projection personnel scattered throughout the country can endure hardship and are able to go deep among the masses. Carrying heavy machines, they travel all year round, trekking through mountains and rivers to bring movies to the doorsteps of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They also provide meticulous and patient explanations, doing everything possible to ensure that the masses see, understand, and appreciate the films. At the same time, they combine the content of the films with the central work of the local area, using various forms of propaganda such as broadcasting, slide shows, picture exhibitions, and seminars to carry out propaganda and mobilization, spreading new people, new things, and advanced scientific and cultural knowledge. Film projection team members have become the Party's capable propagandists. Their spirit of enduring hardship, working diligently, and serving the masses wholeheartedly has been warmly praised by the masses.
    Local Party committees and cultural administrative departments also need to further emphasize this powerful propaganda tool of film projection, strengthen leadership and organizational work, exchange and promote advanced projection experiences, and promote greater popularization of film art, so as to fully exert the propaganda and educational role of film and meet the cultural life needs of the broad masses.
    In the all-round leap forward of socialist construction, the political and cultural levels of our people are advancing rapidly, and the need for cultural life is growing rapidly. Let us pay our highest respect to those film projection workers who are not afraid of hardship, go deep among the masses, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly! Let our country's film projection industry achieve greater development.

　　撒播春天的种子
    我国年青的电影放映事业，十年来得到了空前发展，目前放映队伍已遍及全国城乡，成为一支普及文化的生力军。
    电影放映工作是普及文化教育的一个最有力的、最重要的、最为广大群众所欢迎的宣传武器。通过电影放映，许多具有教育意义的影片在广大群众中发生着很大的影响。实际上放映队是用最快的办法，向几亿农民播送春天的种子。党的号召、共产主义思想、群众的创造、社会主义建设的最新成果，都通过小小的电影放映队的艰苦劳动，传播到每一个山村，让我们国家社会主义建设的春风，吹遍每个角落。电影放映队对于提高群众社会主义觉悟，进行爱国主义与国际主义教育，鼓舞群众生产的积极性，推动生产的发展，有着多么重大的作用！
    新中国的电影放映网从最初建立的时候起，就坚决贯彻为工农兵服务和为政治、生产服务的文艺方针。散布在全国各地的电影放映人员绝大多数都能吃苦耐劳、深入群众，他们携带着笨重的机器，终年奔波、跋山涉水把电影给工农兵群众送上门去，并细致耐心地进行讲解，千方百计使群众看到、看懂、看好电影，同时还根据影片内容结合当地中心工作，运用广播、幻灯、图片展览、座谈等多种宣传方式进行宣传鼓动，传播新人新事和先进的科学文化知识。电影放映队员，成为党的得力的宣传员。他们艰苦耐劳、热心为群众服务的精神，受到群众热烈的赞扬。
    各地党委和文化行政部门，还需进一步重视电影放映这一有力的宣传工具，加强领导和组织工作，交流与推广先进的放映经验，促进电影艺术更大的普及，以充分发挥电影的宣传教育作用和满足广大群众的文化生活需要。
    在社会主义建设全面跃进中，我国人民的政治、文化水平正在突飞猛进，文化生活需要正在飞速增长，让我们向那些不畏艰苦、深入群众、全心全意为工农兵服务的电影放映工作者致以崇高的敬意！让我国电影放映事业得到更大的发展。
