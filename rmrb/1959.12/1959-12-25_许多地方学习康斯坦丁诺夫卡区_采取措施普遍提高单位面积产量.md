　　Moscow Dispatch: A mass movement to learn from the Konstantinovka District in raising per unit area yields is unfolding in many regions of the Soviet Union, striving to harvest 200 poods (3276 kilograms) of grain per hectare (15 mu).
    The Konstantinovka District is located in Ukraine. Previously, an average harvest of 100 poods per hectare was considered the ideal yield. In recent years, due to the measures taken by the Party, the situation in the rural areas has changed. In 1958, the average yield for the entire district reached 158 poods per hectare. In order to welcome the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the Konstantinovka District guaranteed an average yield of 160 poods of grain per hectare in 1960 and 200 poods per hectare in 1962.
    Soviet newspapers pointed out that the main point is not the number "200". Many collective farms have already reached this indicator. The important thing is to enable all districts to produce an average of 200 poods of grain per hectare.
    The Ukrainian Ministry of Agriculture held a meeting, fully supporting the initiative of the Konstantinovka District, calling on all districts of the republic to participate in this movement, pointing out the need to tap potential and strive for two harvests a year.
    The report said that the Stalinino Oblast Party organization and agricultural experts are widely adopting the method suggested by Academician Lysenko—mixed fertilizers made from soil, manure, organic matter, and minerals. The collective farms in the Konstantinovka District have done a very good job in this regard. The Stalinino Oblast Committee decided to require all collective farms to manufacture fertilizers according to Lysenko's suggestions.
    Currently, the Kuban region and many other regions have responded to the call of the Konstantinovka District and have entered into a competition movement.

　　许多地方学习康斯坦丁诺夫卡区
    采取措施普遍提高单位面积产量
　　本报讯　莫斯科消息：苏联许多地区展开了学习康斯坦丁诺夫卡区提高单位面积产量的群众运动，争取每公顷（十五亩）收二百普特（三千二百七十六公斤）谷物。
    康斯坦丁诺夫卡区位于乌克兰，从前这里平均每公顷收一百普特就算是最理想的收成了。由于近年来党采取了措施，农村情况改变了。1958年全区平均每公顷的收成达到了一百五十八普特。为了迎接苏共中央全会，康斯坦丁诺夫卡区保证1960年平均每公顷收一百六十普特谷物，1962年每公顷收二百普特谷物。
    苏联报刊指出，主要之点不在于“二百”这个数字。许多农庄现在已达到了这个指标。重要的是使所有的区都能够平均每公顷出产二百普特谷物。
    乌克兰农业部召开了会议，完全支持康斯坦丁诺夫卡区的倡议，号召共和国各区参加这个运动，指出要注意挖掘潜力，争取一年有两次收获。
    报道中说，斯大林诺州党组织和农业专家正广泛采用李森科院士建议的方法——用土、粪、有机物和矿物混合制成的混合肥料。康斯坦丁诺夫卡区的农庄这方面的工作做得很好。斯大林诺州委员会决定要求所有农庄都按照李森科建议的方法制造肥料。
    目前库班地区和其他许多地区都响应康斯坦丁诺夫卡区的号召，投入了竞赛运动。
