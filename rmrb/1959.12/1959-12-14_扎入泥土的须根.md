    Rootlets Plunging into the Soil
    Meiyuan
    The pine on the high mountain stands tall and firm, the wind cannot blow it down, nor can the rain batter it apart. Why does it possess such vigorous vitality? Because it has countless thick rootlets, deeply plunged into the soil, absorbing ample nourishment. Our Party is the pine, it will forever stand tall atop the high mountain, with far-reaching vision, giving people hope and strength. And our Party’s millions of grassroots cadres and activists are just like the countless rootlets of this pine tree, deeply plunged into the soil—among the masses of the people, tightly linking the tree trunk and the soil together.

    The Party has cultivated a large number of grassroots cadres and activists among the masses, and they are the backbone of the socialist cause. Let us look at one of them to see what role grassroots cadres and activists play in the rural socialist cause:

    Jiang Shouchang, the Party Secretary of Qinghu People's Commune in Luchuan County, Guangxi, served as the chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association during the land reform. At that time, he said: "I don't know much, but relying on everyone's unity, I will definitely work with everyone to the end, overthrow the landlords, and achieve socialism, and will never give up halfway. Wherever the Party points, I will follow." Jiang Shouchang busied himself day and night, mobilizing the masses. The Party, through him and other activists, gave the masses fiery enthusiasm. After collectivization, Jiang Shouchang served as township head and district cadre. In the spring of 1957, in the wave of rampant attacks by capitalist forces in the countryside against advanced cooperatives, he maintained a clear head and stood firm. Under the leadership of the Party, he calmly carried out the struggle. He and other grassroots cadres went deep into the areas with the most households wanting to withdraw from the cooperatives, and talked with the masses, calculated accounts, and made comparisons. Finally, they brought back some farmers who wanted to withdraw, and production was not affected. After the establishment of the People's Commune, Jiang Shouchang served as the Party Secretary of the Commune, and led the peasants to achieve unprecedented increases in production. He moved his office to the fields and worked with the masses. The masses said he was a model in production. They said his advantages were firstly, that he was hardworking and thorough, and took the lead in everything; and secondly, that he resolutely implemented the Party's instructions and humbly listened to the opinions of the masses. Jiang Shouchang himself said: "I have nothing special, I only know how to do things according to the Party's words." "Only know how to do things according to the Party's words," what a simple and yet rich statement! Countless grassroots cadres and activists of our Party, precisely because they resolutely do things according to the Party's words and implement the Party's policies and lines, have become the backbone of the socialist cause.

      Those who "only know how to do things according to the Party's words" are loved by the broad masses and are inevitably hated by all opponents of socialism. Bourgeois rightists attacked them in the past, and now, right-leaning opportunists are also attacking them: "Things were messed up by the grassroots cadres." What did they mess up? No! They brought about the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune! Listen to the rebuke of right-leaning opportunists by the peasants of Xian County, Hebei: "You are only looking at the shortcomings the size of rice grains, and not looking at the achievements the size of bowls!"

    Thirty-two years ago, Chairman Mao, in his "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," had already exposed and refuted the gentlemen who opposed and attacked grassroots cadres. Just like the activists of the peasant movement that Chairman Mao praised at that time, today's grassroots cadres and activists have established great feats in the socialist revolution. Without them, there would be no socialist revolution. Denying them is denying the socialist revolution. Attacking them is attacking the socialist revolution.

    "We should cherish any tiny bit of socialist enthusiasm on the part of the peasants and cadres, and should not frustrate it. We should share the fate and breathe the same air as the cooperative members, cooperative cadres, and county, district, and township cadres, and not frustrate their enthusiasm." (Chairman Mao: "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation") The Party and the broad masses affirm their achievements, which are much larger than bowls, and praise their great contributions to the socialist cause, allowing them to continue to stride forward with full confidence on the socialist road!

    Pine on the high mountain! Those original roots and countless new rootlets, tightly link the pine and the soil together forever!

    扎入泥土的须根
    梅原
    高山上的青松凛然屹立，风吹不倒它，雨打不烂它。为什么它有如此强劲的生命力？因为它有无数粗壮的须根，深深地扎入泥土，吸取着充足的养分。我们的党是青松，它永远屹立在高山之巅，高瞻远瞩，给人们以希望和力量。而我们党的千百万个基层干部和积极分子，正像这棵青松的无数须根一样，深深地扎入泥土——人民群众之中，使树身和泥土紧紧地连结在一起了。
    党在群众中培养了大批基层干部和积极分子，他们是社会主义事业的骨干。让我们通过其中的一个，看一看基层干部和积极分子在农村社会主义事业中，是起着怎样的作用吧：
    广西陆川县清湖人民公社党委书记江寿昌，在土地改革时担任贫雇农主席团主席。当时他说：“我不识什么，靠大家团结，我一定和大家做到底，斗倒地主，搞到社会主义，决不中途丢手。党指到哪里，我就跟到哪里。”江寿昌日夜奔忙，发动群众。党通过他和其他积极分子，给了群众火一般的热力。在合作化后，江寿昌担任了乡长和区干部。1957年春，在农村资本主义势力猖狂攻击高级社的风浪里，他头脑清醒，站稳脚跟，在党的领导下，沉着地进行了斗争。他和其他基层干部，一起深入到闹退社户最多的地方，和群众谈心、算账、对比，终于使有些闹退社的农民归了队，生产上也没有受影响。人民公社成立后，江寿昌担任公社党委书记，又领导农民取得了空前的增产。他把办公地点搬到地头，和群众一起劳动，群众说他是生产上的模范。说他的优点一是艰苦深入，样样带头；二是执行党的指示坚决，虚心听取群众意见。江寿昌自己则说：“我没有什么，只会照党的话办事。”“只会照党的话办事”，这是一句何等简明，而又何等丰富的话！我们党的无数基层干部和积极分子，正因为坚决按照党的话办事，贯彻党的政策路线，成为社会主义事业的骨干。
      “只会照党的话办事”的人，为广大群众所热爱，就必然为一切社会主义的反对者所痛恨。资产阶级右派在过去攻击过他们，现在，右倾机会主义分子也在攻击他们：“事情就是被基层干部搞糟了”。他们搞糟了什么？没有！他们搞出一个大跃进、搞出一个人民公社来了！请听听河北献县农民对右倾机会主义分子的斥责吧：“你这是光看米粒大的缺点，不看那碗大的成绩！”
    三十二年前，毛主席在“湖南农民运动考察报告”里，早已对反对和打击基层干部的老爷们进行了揭露和驳斥。正像毛主席当时歌颂的农民运动积极分子一样，今天的基层干部和积极分子，在社会主义革命大业中建立了奇勋。没有他们，便没有社会主义革命。否认他们，便是否认社会主义革命。打击他们，便是打击社会主义革命。
    “我们应当爱惜农民和干部的任何一点微小的社会主义积极性，而不应当去挫折它。我们应当同合作社社员、合作社干部和县、区、乡干部共命运，同呼吸，不要挫折他们的积极性。”（毛主席：“关于农业合作化问题”）党和广大人民肯定他们比碗还大得多的成绩，赞扬他们对社会主义事业的极大功勋，让他们在社会主义大道上信心百倍地继续阔步前进！
    高山上的青松啊！那原有的根子和无数新的须根，把青松和泥土永远紧密地连结在一起了！
