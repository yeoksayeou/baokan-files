　　Between Mountains and Rivers
　　Liu Feng
    As early as 1853, Marx said, "Climate and soil conditions ... make the use of canals and irrigation projects the basis of Eastern agriculture." In our country, water conservancy construction is particularly important, because our country also has the characteristic of having many high mountains. From the average height of the land, it reaches 2,800 meters, which is 2,370 meters higher than the Soviet Union and 2,500 meters higher than Europe. The disparity in elevation between high mountains and plains is also rare in the world. East of the Taihang Mountains, Funiu Mountains, and Wushan Mountains line, there is a precipitous drop.
    How is such a terrain related to water? This is of great importance. Water flows downwards, as everyone knows. The presence of high and low terrain leads to the appearance of rivers and lakes. The steeper the terrain, the faster the water flows. It comes and goes quickly. It cannot stay on the surface for a long time, nor can it seep into the ground enough to be stored for times of drought. Thus, rain becomes floods, and the absence of rain becomes drought.
    The faster the water flows, the stronger its ability to move, and the more severe the erosion of the ground. The soil covering the mountains is constantly washed away by the water, exposing the gaunt rocks. At this point, it becomes even more difficult for water to seep into the ground, and more water quickly flows off the surface. The increased amount of surface water, in turn, strengthens the destructive force on the mountains. Thus, a vicious cycle emerges: the destructive force of water on the mountains → the destruction of the mountains strengthens the destructive force of the water → the strengthened destructive force of water causes even more severe destruction to the mountains → ….
    This conflict between mountains and water causes people great suffering, and they are called "living in poor mountains, worrying about both drought and flood." And "poor mountains and bad waters" has become a complete phrase.
    However, while the relationship between mountains and water can continuously deteriorate, it can also be mutually reinforcing and complementary. The key is that people cannot allow them to develop naturally or even add fuel to the fire of already deteriorating relationships.
    We must find ways to slow down the water flow and ensure that some of the water is always retained in the mountains.
    We don't need to flatten the mountains. Horizontal ditches, fish-scale pits, check dams, reservoirs, and terraces dug on the mountains are all sufficient to greatly dampen the momentum of rushing water. Because in these places, the terrain becomes locally gentle, the water flow speed has to slow down, and some of the water is temporarily retained.
    We have also found an important helper in mediating the conflict between mountains and water, which is plants. Plants are like umbrellas or coats for the mountains. They prevent raindrops from directly impacting the soil and rocks on the mountains, reducing the damage to the mountains. The roots of plants also unite the soil on the mountains, making it difficult to wash away. And each plant is a small reservoir, both absorbing a lot of water themselves and intercepting a lot of water for storage underground. In forest areas, soil erosion is almost zero, and one hectare of forest evaporates a total weight of 1 to 3.5 million kilograms of moisture into the air each year, and the climate can also be improved.
    Thus, we get a new and beautiful cycle: water enables plants to grow on the mountains → plants enable more water to be retained on the mountains, reducing the damage of water to the mountains → the less damage to the mountains, the more water on the mountains, and the better the plants grow; animals that depend on plants for survival also breed. Developing continuously in this way, it becomes more and more beautiful. We get forest mountains, flower and fruit mountains, cattle and sheep mountains, treasure mountains, and we also avoid the threat of drought and flood at the foot of the mountains, and the reservoirs in the mountains are also a source of electricity.
    Making the relationship between mountains and water enter this beautiful cycle is truly a blessing for future generations. This requires great efforts from us. Mountain areas account for two-thirds of China's area, while forest area only accounted for about one-tenth of the country's total area at the time of national liberation.
    In ancient times, there were water managers, but there was no such thing as mountain managers. The feudal rulers could only "seal Mount Tai and offer sacrifices on Mount Liangfu," worshiping before the large and small mountains. This great cause can only be accomplished by the heroic people of the Mao Zedong era.

　　山水之间
　　柳风
    早在1853年，马克思就说过：“气候和土地条件，……使利用运河和水利工程进行灌溉成了东方农业的基础。”在我国，兴修水利尤为重要，因为我国还有一个特点是山多且高，从陆地的平均高度来看，达到二千八百米，这比苏联高出二千三百七十米，比欧洲高出二千五百米，而高山平原间高低相差的悬殊，也为世界少有，自太行山伏牛山巫山一线以东，真个是一落千丈。
    地势如此，与水何关？这可大有关系，水往低处流，人所共知，地势有高有低，方有河流湖泊的出现，而地势愈陡，水流愈急，来也匆匆，去也匆匆，既不能在地面有较久的停留，又来不及较多地渗入地下储备以供天旱时所需，于是有雨成水灾，无雨成旱灾。
    水流愈急，水的活动能力也愈强，对地面的冲刷也就愈加厉害，复盖山上的土壤不断被水冲走，露出了瘦骨嶙峋的岩石，这时水就更难渗入地下，更多的水迅速打地面流走，而地面流水的水量加大后，反过来对山的破坏力又加强了，于是这里出现了一个恶性的循环，水力对山进行破坏→山的破坏使水的破坏力加强→加强了的水力对山进行更厉害的破坏→……。
    山和水的这种纠纷使得人们大吃苦头，被称作“住在穷山头，旱涝都发愁。”而“穷山恶水”成了一个完整的词儿。
    但是山水之间的关系固然可以不断恶化，但也可以相辅相成，相得益彰，关键在于人们不能听任它们自然发展，或者甚至对已经恶化的关系火上加油。
    我们要设法使水流得慢些，设法使水经常能保持一部分在山中。
    我们用不着把大山夷平，山上挖掘的水平沟、鱼鳞坑，修建的谷坊、水库、梯田等都足以大挫流水汹汹的来势，因为在这些地方，地势局部地变得平缓了，水流速度只好减慢，并且有一部分暂时停留下来。
    我们还找到一个调解山水纠纷的重要帮手，这就是植物，植物像山的雨伞或者外衣，它们使雨点不能直接冲击山上的土石，减弱对山的破坏，植物的根还使山上的土壤团结起来不易冲走，而每一棵植物都是一个小小的水库，一方面自己吸收了许多水分，一方面还拦截了许多水分储藏在地下。在林区，土壤的流失几等于零，而一公顷森林每年蒸发到空中的湿气总重量有一百至三百五十万公斤之多，气候也可以得到改善。
    于是我们得到了一个新的美好的循环，水使山上生长植物→植物使水更多地保持在山上，减轻水对山的破坏→山的破坏愈小、山上的水愈多、植物生长愈好；依赖植物为生的动物也繁殖起来。如此不断发展，愈来愈美好，我们得到了森林山、花果山、牛羊山、万宝山，在山下也免掉了旱涝的威胁，而山中的水库更是电力的来源。
    使山水的关系进入这美好的循环中真是造福万代的事业，这需要我们很大的努力，山区占我国面积的三分之二，而森林面积在全国解放时只有全国总面积十分之一左右。
    在古代，治水者倒还有，治山者就没有听说过，封建统治者们只能“封泰山，禅梁甫”，膜拜于大小山岳之前，这伟大的事业，只有毛泽东时代的英雄人民才能完成。
