    Don't Relax Cultural Learning on Water Conservancy Construction Sites
    When faced with anything, some people always present a pile of difficult conditions first, and the result of this presentation seems to leave them with no other option than to bow to the difficulties. Today's news about the cultural learning of civilian laborers at the Gangnan Reservoir construction site in Hebei Province gives these people another lesson.
    On a water conservancy construction site where tens of thousands of people are working collectively and production is so intense, it is of course difficult to carry out spare-time cultural education without affecting production. If one only sees these difficult aspects, then one can only give up cultural learning. However, on the other side of these unfavorable conditions, there are many favorable conditions, which are as described in the news: most of the civilian laborers are young and middle-aged people, they urgently demand to learn, the reservoir construction site has concentrated production, the working hours are uniform... The Party Committee of the Gangnan Reservoir construction site used these favorable conditions to establish a command headquarters for spare-time cultural education, strengthened leadership, and properly arranged study time. Because the civilian laborers urgently demanded to learn, they created study methods such as "four follows and four walks," "four squeezes," and "five grasps" according to the characteristics of production and specific circumstances, limiting the influence of unfavorable conditions. As a result, spare-time cultural learning developed rapidly, and it did not stop even during the most intense days of labor. By now, more than 30,000 people have shed their illiteracy, and more than 10,000 people have reached the level of higher primary school.
    The facts are not as some people think: it doesn't matter whether cultural learning is carried out or not, as long as the production tasks are completed. After the civilian laborers at the Nangang Reservoir construction site improved their cultural level, they carried out technical innovations on a large scale, which improved labor productivity. Several thousand people mastered one or several technologies, which greatly promoted the progress of the project. If one only sees the unfavorable conditions and does not engage in cultural learning, then it is very likely that the production tasks will indeed not be completed!
    Currently, many places across the country are engaged in large-scale water conservancy projects, concentrating thousands or tens of thousands of people to work together. This is a good opportunity to vigorously promote spare-time cultural education in accordance with local conditions and in accordance with the times. The experience of Gangnan Reservoir can be used for reference.

### 水利工地上不要放松文化学习

    水利工地上不要放松文化学习
    有一些人碰到甚么事情，都要先摆出一堆困难条件，摆的结果，好像除向困难低头外，别无其他办法。今天发表的河北省岗南水库工地民工学文化的新闻，又给这些人上了一堂课。
    在几万人集体劳动的水利工地，生产是那样紧张，要开展业余文化教育而不影响生产，当然会有许多困难。假如光看到这些困难的一面，则只有放弃文化学习。但是，也正是在这些不利条件的另一面，有着许多有利条件，这就是像新闻中所讲的：民工中青壮年多，他们迫切要求学习，水库工地生产集中，劳动时间统一……。岗南水库工地党委利用了这些有利条件，建立了业余文化教育的指挥部，加强了领导，妥善安排了学习时间；由于民工迫切要求学习，他们根据生产的特点和具体情况，创造了“四跟四走”“四挤”“五抓”等学习方法，限制了不利条件的影响，结果业余文化学习迅速开展起来了，在劳动最紧张的日子里也没有间断，到现在已经有三万多人摘掉文盲帽子，一万多人达到高小水平。
    事实也并不是像有些人所想的那样：生产任务完不成交代不过去，文化学习搞不搞没关系。南岗水库工地民工提高文化水平以后，大搞技术革新，提高了劳动生产率，有几千人掌握了一种或几种技术，大大促进了工程的进度。如果只看到不利条件，不去搞文化学习，那么生产任务就很可能当真交代不过去哩！
    现在全国许多地方都在大兴水利，集中几千人、几万人在一起劳动，正好借此机会因地制宜、因时制宜地大搞业余文化教育。岗南水库的经验可资借鉴。
