Be a Good Vanguard in Agricultural Production
Commentator of this newspaper

    The favorable situation of the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has opened up broad prospects and created favorable conditions for accelerating the development of China's meteorological work. Since the Great Leap Forward, China's meteorological work has made great achievements in serving socialist construction, especially agricultural production, and has changed the face of meteorological work. A meteorological service network has been basically established throughout the country. According to statistics up to September this year, the number of meteorological stations run by the state has increased by 75.8% compared with 1957. At the same time, mass meteorological organizations have also developed greatly, and meteorological outposts and weather observation groups have been established in people's communes and production brigades. At present, a meteorological service network of "stations in every special zone, posts in every county, outposts in every commune, and groups in every brigade" has been densely distributed throughout the country, forming a meteorological army with both meteorological personnel and the participation of the broad masses. Under the guidance of the principle of "taking production service as the key link and agricultural service as the focus," this meteorological army has established a production viewpoint, a service viewpoint, and a mass viewpoint, faced production, penetrated into rural areas, and widely carried out meteorological service work. In the process of serving production, due to the full play of the role of state-run meteorological stations and mass meteorological outposts, modern meteorological science has been combined with the rich experience of the masses, business and technology have been innovated, and weather forecasting methods that combine indigenous and foreign methods, large, medium, and small scales have been created, enriching and developing China's meteorological science and greatly improving the quality of weather forecasts. Due to the continuous improvement of the quality of weather forecasts, it has played a great role in serving agricultural production and has achieved remarkable results. For example, in overcoming this year's extraordinarily severe natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, frost, and insects, the vast meteorological stations and outposts stood at the forefront of the struggle against natural disasters, playing the role of "vanguard" and "advisor."

    Experience has proven that to do a good job in meteorological service, it is impossible to rely solely on the strength of a few professional meteorological workers, and it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses under the leadership of party committees at all levels to establish a widespread meteorological service network. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and the climate situation is complex, and the impact of climatic conditions on crops varies from place to place. To make meteorological service closely integrated with production needs, adapting to local conditions, specific times, and specific matters, it is necessary to combine the strength of professional meteorological workers and the broad masses, gather wisdom and pool efforts, and let everyone "manage the weather." In this way, we can focus on the center, combine with production, be good advisors, and provide good service. For example, in the sweet potato storage work in Shandong Province this year, more than 3,000 meteorological stations and outposts were mobilized to conduct observation services for more than 600,000 sweet potato cellars. Due to the timely heat dissipation and insulation of the sweet potato cellars by the broad masses, rot and frostbite were completely avoided. May I ask, to conduct observation services for so many sweet potato cellars, without relying on the strength of the vast meteorological outposts and without mobilizing the broad masses, it is impossible to do a good job in service. The establishment of a meteorological service network combining national stations and mass outposts can not only mobilize the strength of professional meteorological personnel and the broad masses to do a good job in service, but also can simultaneously promote indigenous and foreign methods and rapidly develop China's meteorological science.

    Weather changes are particularly significantly affected by terrain and geographical characteristics. Not only does the weather situation in a province vary, but even the weather situation in a county and a commune can be very different. As the saying goes, "Thunderstorms are separated by a cow's back." This sentence vividly reveals the complexity and regional nature of weather changes. Therefore, to accurately forecast the weather in each specific place and make it closely integrated with the needs of production, it is necessary to combine modern meteorological science with the rich experience of the masses, combine large-scale weather changes with the characteristics of local weather changes, and resolutely implement the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods and combining weather forecasts of large, medium, and small scales.

    In the struggle against nature, the Chinese working people have accumulated rich experience. Most of these experiences are combined with production needs. Since the Great Leap Forward, the vast meteorological stations, posts, outposts, and groups have gained many valuable experiences and conclusions in applying the experience of the masses, which have greatly enriched the content of meteorological science. Seriously studying and summarizing the experience of the masses and better combining modern meteorological science with the rich experience of the masses can rapidly improve the accuracy of weather forecasts and promote the development of meteorological science. Denying the simultaneous use of indigenous and foreign methods and looking down on the experience of the masses will hinder the improvement of forecast accuracy and also hinder the rapid development of meteorological science. In this regard, the experience of the Baimao Meteorological Outpost in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, and the former Beijing Forecast Group of the Central Meteorological Science Research Institute are a clear contrast. Because the Baimao Outpost conscientiously listened to the weather forecasts of large stations and county stations, combined with agricultural proverbs, as well as the changes in local celestial phenomena, physical phenomena, and meteorological elements, it made supplementary forecasts, and the accuracy rate reached about 97%. However, the former Beijing Weather Forecast Group of the Central Meteorological Science Research Institute, due to the lack of a production viewpoint, insisted on using only foreign methods in forecasting, without combining the experience of the masses and the characteristics of local weather. Several heavy rains, strong winds, and hailstorms in the Beijing area this year were not forecast, causing great losses to production. Two methods, two results. Of course, we do not deny the role of modern meteorological science and professional meteorological workers. Rather, we are saying that professional meteorological workers must be combined with the masses, and modern meteorological science must be combined with the experience of the masses, in order to promote the continuous development of meteorological science.

    Next year will be a year of continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture and ensuring the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year are the most important tasks for the Chinese people at present. Meteorological work is the vanguard of agricultural production and must have a greater leap forward in order to meet the needs of the development of the situation. On the agricultural front, adhering to the "Eight-Character Constitution" and accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture require meteorological service to be more accurate and more rigorous, which puts forward many new topics for meteorological workers. For example, the relationship between mechanized operations and weather changes and soil moisture changes, the impact of climatic conditions on the planning, design, and construction of water conservancy projects, etc., should all be put on the agenda and start to be studied and resolved so that meteorological work can better play the role of production vanguard.

    At present, in the meteorological work departments, a mass movement should be launched focusing on improving service quality and comprehensively improving business quality, grasping disaster weather forecasts with one hand and agricultural meteorological forecasts with the other. In terms of disaster weather forecasting, it is necessary to ensure that weather forecasts such as cold waves, frosts, typhoons, and strong winds at sea are accurate and timely, and to do a good job in service. In terms of agricultural meteorological forecasts, first of all, it is necessary to combine with the local main crops to do a good job in forecasting the sowing period, flowering period, and harvest period, and to closely cooperate with the agricultural departments to do a good job in predicting and forecasting plant diseases and insect pests. In addition, professional forecasts for forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery should also be vigorously carried out.

　　当好农业生产的尖兵
　　本报评论员
    工农业生产持续跃进的有利形势，为加速我国气象工作的发展，开辟了广阔的前途，创造了良好的条件。大跃进以来，我国气象事业在为社会主义建设、特别是为农业生产服务方面，取得了很大成绩，改变了气象工作的面貌。在全国范围内，已经基本上建成了气象服务网。截至今年9月份的统计，国家办的气象台站比1957年增长了75.8％。与此同时，群众性的气象组织也有了很大发展，在人民公社和生产大队建立了气象哨和看天小组。目前，一个“专区有台、县县有站、社社有哨、队队有组”的气象服务网已经密布全国，组成了既有气象人员、又有广大群众参加的气象大军。这支气象大军，在“以生产服务为纲，以农业服务为重点”方针的指导下，树立了生产观点、服务观点和群众观点，面向生产，深入农村，广泛地开展了气象服务工作。在为生产服务的过程中，由于充分发挥了国家办的气象台站和群众性气象哨组的作用，就把近代气象科学和群众的丰富经验结合了起来，革新了业务技术，创造了土洋并举、大中小相结合的天气预报方法，丰富和发展了我国气象科学，大大提高了天气预报质量。由于天气预报质量的不断提高，在为农业生产服务上，发挥了很大作用，取得了显著效果。如在战胜今年旱、涝、风、冻、虫等特大自然灾害方面，广大的气象台站哨组，站在与天灾作斗争的最前哨，起到了“尖兵”和“参谋”的作用。
    经验证明，要做好气象服务工作，只依靠少数专业气象工作者的力量是不可能的，必须在各级党委领导下，充分发动群众、依靠群众，建立起星罗棋布的气象服务网。我国地大物博，气候情况复杂，农作物受气候条件的影响各地有所差异。要使气象服务工作密切结合生产需要，因地、因时、因事制宜，必须把专业气象工作者和广大群众的力量结合起来，群策群力，人人“管天”。这样，才能围绕中心，结合生产，当好参谋，服务得好。如山东省在今年地瓜的储藏工作中，发动三千多个气象台站哨组，对六十多万个地瓜窖进行观测服务，由于广大群众对地瓜窖及时散温和保温，完全避免了腐烂和冻伤。试问，对这么多地瓜窖进行观测服务，不依靠广大气象哨组的力量，不发动广大群众，是不能做好服务工作的。建立国家台站和群众性哨组相结合的气象服务网，不仅可以动员专业气象人员和广大群众的力量，做好服务工作，而且可以土洋并举，迅速发展我国气象科学。
    天气变化受地形地理特点的影响，特别显著，不仅一省天气情况有所差异，甚至一县和一个公社的天气情况也存有很大差异。俗话说，“雷雨隔牛背”。这句话十分形象地道破了天气变化的复杂性和地区性。因此，要报准每个具体地方的天气，并使之能密切结合生产的需要，必须把近代气象科学和群众的丰富经验结合起来，把大范围天气变化和局部天气变化特点结合起来，坚决贯彻土洋并举、天气预报大中小相结合的方针。
    我国劳动人民在向大自然斗争中，积累了丰富的经验。这些经验，大部分都是结合生产需要的。大跃进以来，广大气象台、站、哨、组在运用群众的经验中，得出了许多宝贵的经验和结论，大大地丰富了气象科学的内容。认真学习和总结群众经验，更好地把近代气象科学和群众的丰富经验结合起来，就可以迅速地提高天气预报准确率，推动气象科学的发展。否定土法、洋法并举，看不起群众的经验，就会妨碍预报准确率的提高，也会妨碍气象科学较快的发展。在这方面，江苏省常熟县白茆气象哨和中央气象科学研究所原北京预报组的经验就是个显明的对比。白茆哨由于认真地收听大台和县站的天气预报，结合农谚，以及本地天象、物象、气象要素的变化，作出补充预报，准确率达到97％左右。而中央气象科学研究所原北京天气预报组，由于缺乏生产观点，在预报中坚持只用洋办法，没结合群众的经验和地方天气的特点，今年北京地区几次暴雨、大风、冰雹都未报出，使生产遭到了很大损失。两种方法，两种结果。当然，我们并不否定近代气象科学和专业气象工作者的作用。而是说，专业气象工作者必须与群众相结合，近代气象科学必须与群众经验相结合，才能推动气象科学的不断发展。
    明年是工农业生产继续跃进的一年，加速农业技术改造和保证实现明年农业生产继续跃进，是当前我国人民头等重要的任务。气象工作是农业生产的尖兵，必须有更大的跃进，才能适应形势发展的需要。在农业战线上，坚持“八字宪法”和加速农业技术改造，要求气象服务工作更加准确、更加严格，给气象工作者提出了许多新的课题。例如，机械化作业的进行与天气变化、土壤水分变化之间的关系，水利化的规划、设计、施工，受气候条件的影响等等，都应该提上日程，着手研究解决，使气象工作更好地起到生产尖兵的作用。
    当前，在气象工作部门，应该掀起一个以提高服务质量为中心的全面提高业务质量的群众运动，一手抓灾害性天气预报，一手抓农业气象预报。在灾害性天气预报方面，要确实保证寒潮、霜冻、台风和海上大风等天气预报，准确及时，做好服务工作。在农业气象预报方面，首先要结合当地的主要作物，做好播种期、扬花期和收获期的预报，并密切配合农业部门做好病虫害的预测预报。此外，林业、畜牧、渔业等专业预报，也应该大力开展。
