The Final Sprint
    Our Shanghai Correspondent

    As the year draws to a close, over one million workers in Shanghai are making a valiant sprint towards the finish line of the "100-meter race." A great victory for the entire year is now within sight.

    "Star" Factories Helping "Star" Factory
    Production has recently become increasingly intense at the Qunxing Machinery Manufacturing Factory, and there are more and more unfamiliar faces appearing at the factory. Originally a factory with only two to three hundred workers, it now appears to have more than four hundred. It turns out that this factory was having difficulty completing its annual plan. After many fraternal factories learned of this situation, they immediately "dispatched troops and generals," sending people to provide support.

    The Qunxing Factory is undertaking a batch of papermaking machine manufacturing tasks. The work is complex. The papermaking machine that produces twenty-five tons of paper per day alone has over 70,000 parts. Because it was the first time manufacturing them and they had no experience, only 81% of the annual plan had been completed by the end of November. Therefore, a work group dedicated to supporting the Qunxing Factory in completing its plan was established under the leadership of the superior company. After the workers of the Hefengyong Machine Factory calculated that they could complete this year's plan well ahead of schedule, they immediately selected more than thirty experienced workers, led by the factory director, and headed to the Qunxing Factory in a mighty force. Subsequently, the Chenxingji Machine Factory, the People's Machine Factory, and other factories also transferred personnel, vacated equipment, and made room.

    Walking into the Qunxing Factory's director's office is like walking into a frontline command post. More than a dozen factory directors who came to provide support gathered here to offer ideas. Hu Guibao, the director of the Qunxing Factory, is in charge of the progress of all departments in the factory. Li Xingquan, the director of the Hefengyong Machine Factory, is here discussing how to strengthen the contact work of outsourced parts. Over there, the sound of loud telephone calls can be heard. That is Wang Jixiang, the section chief of the People's Machine Factory, who is negotiating with a metal spraying factory about the copper plating of a batch of parts. A huge collaboration table hangs on the office wall, densely filled with factory names, telling people that there are dozens of factories fighting intensely for the Qunxing Factory.

    These days, a sense of impending victory can be felt everywhere. The large machine frame of the papermaking machine in the south of the workshop is still being assembled, and the drying cylinder in the north has been completely completed. The workers outside the workshop are already transporting some of the packaged parts outside.

        High Speed Radiates Great Splendor

    The Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, which has already completed the annual state plan ahead of schedule, also completed the annual Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule on the 12th of this month. On this day, they completed the last product—a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator. This steam turbine generator only took seventeen days, whereas last year it took them more than eighty days.

    In rushing to produce this last product, the workers said heroically: "We must let the soul of the General Line—high speed—radiate great splendor in our products."

    On the morning of the 26th of last month, when the more than ten-ton rotor blank was transported into the steam turbine generator workshop, the curtain was raised on a fierce struggle to "compete for kilowatts against time." The workers in the first process, the lathe team, immediately took out the sharp cutting tools they had prepared and, according to the pre-planned measures—double-person, double-knife simultaneous powerful cutting—worked vigorously. When the rotor was passed to the milling machine like a baton in a relay race, the lathe team attached a red bulletin. Yu Yongxing, a milling machine master, gently read the few roughly written characters on it: "The lathe breaks a new record again, the outlook depends on you milling team!" Yu Yongxing understood in his heart: the lathe team completed the plan twenty hours ahead of schedule and came to "challenge" them. After all, Yu Yongxing was experienced and decided to increase the cutting depth by a factor of one. Sure enough, the processing efficiency was greatly improved. He immediately introduced the experience to other milling machine masters, so that the plan was completed five hours ahead of schedule.

    When the rotor was still being processed on the milling machine, the winding workers were already conducting large-scale training on the rotor of another steam turbine generator. As soon as the rotor arrived, they immediately started working, with hot hearts and nimble hands, and they wound a coil in only one hour, three times more efficient than in the past.

          The Director's Experimental Furnace

    Walking into the converter workshop of the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6, bursts of dazzling steel flowers continuously spew out from the mouths of the three converters. In the past, this place has always been tense, and in the days leading up to the end of the year, the atmosphere seems more unusual. At this time, the factory director and the party secretary are conducting a new high-yield experiment on a furnace. At a glance, it can be seen that this experimental furnace is working even more happily than other furnaces. It lowers its head to drink four or five tons of molten iron, then eats a little lime and silicon iron, stretches its waist, and spews out red-hot slag and thick yellow smoke. The flame in the furnace mouth changes from long to short, from red to white. In less than twenty minutes, the molten steel is poured out.

    Since the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 has adhered to the General Line, constantly opposing conservative and lax attitudes, so that all employees are always full of forward-moving vitality, production has continued to comprehensively leap forward, and the current steel production level has doubled compared to the beginning of the year without increasing personnel or equipment. In order to overfulfill the national target of producing twelve million tons of steel this year as much as possible, the workers of the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6, like the steelworkers of other plants, are determined to boost their enthusiasm in December and further improve the level of steelmaking. The factory director and the party secretary went to the workshop to conduct experimental furnaces with the masses in order to find new ways to speed up steelmaking. They observed and recorded every steelmaking operation and the changes in the furnace carefully for three consecutive days next to the experimental furnace, and found that after changing certain steelmaking operations, the amount of lime used could be further reduced, the smelting time could be shortened, and the quality of steel ingots could be improved; therefore, a comparative experiment was immediately organized on Furnace No. 1 and Furnace No. 5. They used molten iron of the same composition to supply these two furnaces for blowing, but the No. 1 experimental furnace adopted new operating methods and added two-thirds less lime than the No. 5 furnace. On the 12th, the experiment was finally successful. Furnace No. 1 managed to produce a furnace of steel every fifteen to twenty minutes, and nine of the twelve furnaces of steel were high-quality welding rod steel.

    The experimental furnace of the factory director and the party secretary established a benchmark among the steelworkers, and the workers used the experience gained from the experimental furnace to improve their operations. The smelting time has been generally shortened, and the furnace life has been generally extended. The output on the 13th and 14th continuously exceeded 400 tons, an increase of 11% compared to the average daily output in the first ten days of this month.

      Assault Battle on the Railway Line

    Boom, boom, boom... Trains loaded with machinery, equipment, and daily necessities, like long dragons, whizzed out of the Zhenru Station and rushed to all parts of the country.

    Starting on the evening of the 13th, the Zhenru Station launched a transportation assault battle. More than 1,200 railway workers quickly loaded, unloaded, and transported, seizing the eighteen days within the year to transport all the materials Shanghai supported the construction of various places this year.

    A busy scene unfolded on the station's eight loading and unloading operation lines. The crane booms towering in the air, like the arms of giants, hoisted boxes of machines that had just been transported from the factory into the train. The locomotives scheduling vehicles pulled the loaded cars back and forth for marshalling. On some lines, the workers launched an assault loading as soon as the goods from other places were unloaded. Some workers stood on the carriages loaded with steel plates and were busily loading bundles of bicycle steel rims. In the transportation assault battle, the workers cleverly loaded more, using the "piggyback" method of carrying light goods with heavy goods and carrying small goods with large goods to tap the potential of the vehicles. These two days, more than one hundred tons of goods were carried out without using flatcars every day.

    In the nearby dispatch room, dispatcher Xu Chunhui was busy directing the loading and unloading of goods and scheduling vehicles on each line, speaking into the microphone on the table. A small loudspeaker beside him continuously broadcast reports from the weighmen on the line: the goods on that car have been unloaded, that car has been loaded... Dispatcher Zhang Yanqi walked in, hurriedly wrote a "vehicle dispatch card," and then took the red and green flags and rushed out to direct the locomotive.

    The assault battle got off to a flying start. From 6 p.m. on the 14th to 6 p.m. on the 15th, in one day and night, the Zhenru Station loaded a car every thirteen minutes on average, and the total volume of goods dispatched reached 3,300 tons, an increase of 13% compared to usual.

    These days, all cargo stations in Shanghai have launched transportation assault battles like Zhenru Station. They sorted the goods to be transported and put the materials urgently needed for local production and construction first. Now, the railway workers are seizing every minute and second, working day and night to rush to transport these materials and support the opening red of the production of industrial and mining enterprises in various places next year.

    最后的冲刺
    本报驻上海记者
    岁末，上海一百多万职工正在向着“百米赛跑”的终点勇猛冲刺。现在，全年大捷已经在望。
  群星帮“群星”
    群星机械制造厂最近生产越来越紧张了，厂里出现的陌生面孔也越来越多。本来只有二、三百工人的一个工厂，现在看上去有四百人还多。原来，这个厂完成今年计划有困难，许多兄弟工厂知道这个情况以后，立即“调兵遣将”，派人前来支援。
    群星厂担负了一批造纸机的制造任务。活儿复杂，单单日产二十五吨纸的造纸机，零件就有七万多件。因为是第一次制造，没有经验，到11月底还只完成年计划的81％。于是，一个全力支援群星厂完成计划的工作组，在上级公司的领导下成立起来了。和丰涌机器厂职工一算自己可以大大提前完成今年计划，立即挑选了三十多个有经验的工人，在厂长率领下，浩浩荡荡地赶到群星厂。接着，陈兴记机器厂、人民机器厂等工厂也调人的调人，腾设备的腾设备，让场地的让场地。
    走进群星厂的厂长办公室，真像走进了一个前线指挥部。前来支援的十多个工厂的厂长，聚在这里一起出主意。群星厂厂长胡桂宝掌握着全厂各个部门的进度。和丰涌机器厂厂长李兴泉正在这边和人们讨论如何加强外包件的联系工作。那边，传来了高声打电话的声音，那是人民机器厂的工段长汪吉祥正在和一家喷金属的工厂接洽一批部件的涂铜问题。办公室墙上挂着一张巨大的协作表，表上密密麻麻地排列着工厂名字，这告诉人们：还有几十个工厂在为群星厂紧张地战斗着。
    这几天，到处可感受到胜利在望的气氛。车间南面的造纸机大机架还在装配，北面的烘缸已经全部完工。车间外面的工人们已经在把部分包装好的部件往外运了。
        高速度大放光芒
    已经提前完成全年国家计划的上海电机厂，在本月12日又提前完成了全年跃进计划。这一天，他们完成了最后一台产品——二万五千瓩汽轮发电机，这台汽轮发电机只用了十七天时间，而他们在去年是用了八十几天。
    在赶制最后这台产品中，工人们豪迈地说：“一定要让总路线的灵魂——高速度，在我们的产品中大放光芒。”
    上月26日清晨，当十多吨重的转子毛坯运进了汽轮发电机车间，一场激烈的“向时间争瓩”的斗争序幕就揭开了。第一道工序车床班的工人，立即拿出早已准备好的锐利车刀，按照事先计划好的措施——双人双刀同时强力切削，猛干起来。当转子像接力赛跑中的接力棒一样，传到铣床上的时候，车床班附来了一张红色的喜报。铣床老师傅俞永兴，轻轻地念着上面墨汁未干的几个草字：“车床再破新纪录，苗头看侬刨铣班！”俞永兴心里明白：车床班提前二十小时完成了计划，来“将”他们的“军”了。到底俞永兴的经验足，决定把吃刀量提高一倍。果然，加工效率提高了许多。他马上向其他铣床老师傅介绍了经验，使计划提前五个小时完成了。
    当转子还在铣床上加工的时候，嵌线工人已经在另一台汽轮发电机的转子上大练兵了。转子一到，他们马上就干起来，心热手快，只用了一个小时就嵌好了一只线圈，效率比过去提高了三倍。
          厂长的试验炉
    走进上钢六厂的转炉车间，一阵阵耀眼的钢花不停地从三座转炉炉口喷出来。往常，这里一向是紧张的，在临近年底的日子里，气氛更显得不比寻常。这时候，厂长和党委书记正在一座炉子上作一次新的高产试验。一眼望去就可看出，这只试验炉比其他炉子干得更欢。它一会儿低下头来喝进四、五吨铁水，一会儿吃一点石灰、矽铁伸伸腰喷出通红的渣子和浓浓的黄烟。炉口里火光由长变短、由红变白，不到二十分钟，钢水倒出来了。
    今年以来，上钢六厂坚持总路线，不断反对保守松劲情绪，使全厂职工经常充满着前进的朝气，生产持续全面跃进，在不增加人、不增加设备的条件下，使目前的钢产水平比年初翻了一番。为了尽可能超额完成全国今年产钢一千二百万吨的指标，上钢六厂的职工和其他厂的炼钢工人一样，决心在12月份鼓起干劲，把炼钢的水平进一步提高。厂长和党委书记到车间里和群众一起搞试验炉，就是为了寻找加快炼钢速度的新道路。他们在试验炉旁和工人技术人员一起，连续三天仔细地观察和记录每道炼钢操作以及炉子的变化，发现某些炼钢操作改变后，可以进一步减少石灰用量，缩短冶炼时间，提高钢锭质量；于是，马上在一号炉和五号炉上组织了一次对比性的试验。他们用同样成份的铁水供应这两座炉子吹炼，只是一号试验炉比五号炉采用新的操作法和少加三分之二石灰。12日这一天，试验终于成功了。一号炉做到每十五到二十分钟就炼出一炉钢，并在十二炉钢中有九炉是优质电焊条钢。
    厂长和党委书记的试验炉在炼钢工人中树立了标兵，工人们用试验炉上取得的经验来改进他们的操作。使冶炼时间普遍缩短，炉龄普遍延长。13、14两天的产量连续突破四百吨，比这个月上旬的平均日产量增长了11％。
      铁路线上的突击战
    轰隆、轰隆、轰隆……满载着机器设备和日用百货的火车，像一条条长龙，驰出真如车站，奔向全国各地。
    从13日晚上开始，真如车站展开了一场运输突击战。一千二百多个铁路工人快装、快卸、快运，抓紧年内十八天，把今年上海支援各地建设的物资，全部运出去。
    车站的八条装卸作业线上，一片繁忙景象。高耸在空中的起重机吊杆，像巨人的手臂，把才从工厂运到的一箱箱机器吊进火车。调度车辆的火车头，牵引着装好的车皮，来回奔跑编组。有的线路上，刚刚卸下外地运来的货物，工人就突击装车。有些工人站在装着钢板的车厢上，正在紧张地把一捆捆自行车钢圈加载上去。在运输突击战中，工人们巧装多载，用重带轻、大带小等种种“捎脚”的办法，大挖车辆潜力。这两天，不用车皮带出去的货物每天有一百多吨。
    在附近的调度室里，调度员许春惠对着桌上的话筒，忙着指挥各条线路的货物装卸，调度车辆。他身旁的一只小喇叭里，不断传出线路上司磅员的报告：那个车皮的货物已经卸完，那个车皮已经装好……调度员张延启走进来，匆匆的写好“调车卡”以后，又拿着红、绿旗，奔出去指挥机车。
    突击战旗开得胜。从14日晚上六时到15日晚上六时的一昼夜间，真如车站平均每十三分钟就装好了一个车皮，总发货量达到三千三百吨，比平时增加13％。
    这几天，上海各个货运车站都和真如站一样展开了运输突击战。他们对待运物资进行排队，把各地生产建设上急需的物资放在第一位。现在，铁路工人正抓紧一分一秒，夜以继日地赶运这些物资，支援各地工矿企业明年生产开门红。（附图片）
