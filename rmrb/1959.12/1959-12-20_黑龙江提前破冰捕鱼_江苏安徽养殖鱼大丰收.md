Heilongjiang Begins Ice Fishing Early
Jiangsu and Anhui Enjoy Bumper Harvest of Farmed Fish

Our newspaper's correspondent in Harbin reported on the 19th that in Heilongjiang Province, a well-known freshwater fish production area in China, from the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers along the Sino-Soviet border to the network of inland rivers and the famous lakes such as Xingkai Lake, Jingbo Lake, and Wudalianchi, all have frozen over. Currently, employees of state-owned aquaculture farms and fishermen from people's communes along the rivers and lakes throughout the province are braving wind and snow, working day and night to break the ice and lay nets, engaging in this year's winter ice fishing production with soaring enthusiasm. The crucian carp, carp, and snakehead fish caught from under the ice by various fishing grounds are piling up like mountains, and batches of fresh fish are being transported to various parts of the province by rail and over the ice. According to statistics from Heilongjiang Province's aquatic products department, ice fishing has just begun, and the current average daily output of fish in the province has reached 240,000 jin. With the advent of the winter fishing high tide, the daily output will increase greatly.

Although the ice-sealing period for rivers in Heilongjiang Province was somewhat delayed this year, due to the emphasis placed on winter fisheries production by Party committees at all levels, the work of ice fishing was grasped earlier this winter than in previous years. Therefore, the winter fishing work in the province is moving faster and the production momentum is greater than in any previous year. After vigorously criticizing various right-leaning conservative sentiments that were detrimental to fisheries production, various localities conducted detailed surveys of fish resources. Based on these surveys, they started with improving the production enthusiasm of fishermen, arranged labor, fishing grounds, and fishing gear according to local conditions, adjusted fishing organizations, formulated production plans, and implemented production tasks. At the same time, when the ice layer on the rivers and lakes could support people walking and vehicles traveling, a vigorous fishing production began. The people's communes in Fujin County, located in the lower reaches of the Songhua River, after arranging winter agricultural production after the autumn harvest, immediately extracted more than 1,900 people and formed four fishing brigades. Due to improved operating procedures and increased fishing efficiency, the current daily fish catch in the county has reached about 80,000 jin. In the Dorbod Mongolian Autonomous County along the Nen River, more than 1,000 people have been mobilized since the beginning of winter to form a professional fishing team, dispatching sixteen large nets and harvesting 24,000 jin of fresh fish per day.

Our newspaper's correspondent in Nanjing reported on the 19th that people's communes in Jiangsu are launching a concentrated effort to catch farmed fish. According to statistics for the first ten days of December, the amount of farmed fish caught throughout the province increased by about 50% compared with the same period last month. This year, the planned output of farmed fish in Jiangsu Province accounts for more than 47% of the total planned output of aquatic products, a very large proportion. Therefore, the completion of the farmed fish production plan is an important link in completing and overfulfilling the total annual output plan for aquatic products. In order to complete the annual production increase task and ensure market supply, people's communes in various places have broken the old habit of starting to catch fish only during the Spring Festival and are actively organizing manpower and material resources to carry out fish production. During the concentrated fishing effort, many regions have organized professional teams. In Zhenjiang Prefecture, more than 5,500 people are engaged in specialized fishing. The Tingguan Commune in Jintan County established a farmed fish catching team to cooperate with various agricultural brigades in concentrated fishing, increasing the daily output from more than 200 jin to more than 1,000 jin.

Our newspaper's correspondent in Hefei reported on the 19th that since the beginning of winter, various parts of Anhui Province have transferred a large number of laborers, seized the peak season, and launched large-scale fishing work. According to statistics at the end of November, the province had completed 87.18% of this year's adult fish production plan. The fishing volume increased the fastest in October and November, and the output in these two months exceeded the total output of the previous nine months by 3.7%. Various localities are currently carrying out winter fishing, striving to overfulfill the annual fishery production task.

Anhui Province suffered a hundred days of severe drought this year, and the water sources in ditches, ponds, rivers, and lakes in most areas were dry and shallow, reducing natural fish resources significantly, and causing great difficulties in stocking fish fry and adult fish. However, because the great superiority of the people's communes was brought into play, these difficulties were not only overcome one by one, but also achieved a large increase in production despite the severe drought.

### 黑龙江提前破冰捕鱼  江苏安徽养殖鱼大丰收

    黑龙江提前破冰捕鱼
    江苏安徽养殖鱼大丰收
    本报哈尔滨19日电　我国著名的淡水鱼类出产地区的黑龙江省境内，从中苏边境的黑龙江、乌苏里江到交织如网的内地大小江河，以及兴凯湖、镜泊湖、五大莲池等著名的湖泊已经冰封。目前，全省各地江湖沿岸国营水产养殖场的职工和人民公社的渔民们，正在冒着风雪出没在江湖之上，日日夜夜破冰敷网，以冲天的干劲进行着今年的冬季冰下捕鱼生产。各个渔场从冰下捕出来的鲫鱼、鲤鱼、黑鱼堆积如山，成批的新鲜鱼通过铁路和冰上运往省内各地。据黑龙江省水产部门的统计，冰下捕鱼刚刚开始，当前全省捕鱼平均日产量达到二十四万斤。随着冬季捕鱼高潮的来临，日产量将大大的增加。
    今年黑龙江省虽然江河冰封期比往年有所推迟，但是由于各级党委对今年冬季渔业生产的重视，今冬各地对冰下捕鱼工作抓的较早，因而全省冬季捕鱼工作比往年行动较快，生产声势也比以往任何一年都大。各地在有力的批判种种不利于渔业生产的右倾保守情绪之后，详细地调查了鱼源，在这些基础上，从提高渔民生产积极性入手，因地制宜的安排了劳动力、渔场和渔具，调整了捕鱼组织，制定了生产方案，并且落实了生产任务。同时，各地江湖上的冰层能够撑住人走、车行的时候，便开始了轰轰烈烈地捕捞生产。位于松花江下游的富锦县的各人民公社，在秋收以后安排好冬季农业生产以后，立即抽出一千九百多人，组成了四个捕鱼大队。由于改进操作规程，提高捕捞效率，目前全县日捕鱼量达到八万斤左右。嫩江沿岸的杜尔柏特蒙古族自治县，入冬以来动员一千多人成立了专业捕鱼队，出动十六趟大网，日收鲜鱼二万四千斤。（冯佳林）
    本报南京19日电　江苏各地人民公社突击捕捞养殖鱼。据12月份的头十天的统计，全省养殖鱼的起捕量比上月同期增长50％左右。今年，江苏省养殖鱼的计划产量占水产品生产计划总产量的47％以上，比重很大，因此养殖鱼生产计划的完成，是完成和超额完成全年水产品计划总产量的重要一环。为了完成全年增产任务，保证市场供应，各地人民公社打破往年到春节时才起捕的老习惯，积极组织人力、物力开展捕鱼生产。在突击捕捞中，许多地区组织了专业队。镇江专区担任专门捕捞的有五千五百多人。金坛县汀官公社成立养殖鱼捕捞队配合各农业大队突击捕捞，使日产量由二百多斤上升到一千多斤。

    本报合肥19日电　安徽省各地入冬以来，抽调了大批劳力，抓住旺季，开展大规模捕鱼工作。到11月底统计，全省已完成今年成鱼生产计划数的87.18％。10月和11月，捕鱼量上升最快，这两个月的产量就超过前九个月产量总和的3.7％。各地目前正在开展冬季捕捞，力争超额完成全年渔业生产任务。
    安徽省今年遭受了百日大旱，大部地区的沟塘、河、湖水源枯浅，天然鱼源减少很多，放养鱼种、成鱼也都有很大困难。但是因为发挥了人民公社的巨大优越性，这些困难不但被一一克服，而且还在大旱的情况下得到了大增产。
