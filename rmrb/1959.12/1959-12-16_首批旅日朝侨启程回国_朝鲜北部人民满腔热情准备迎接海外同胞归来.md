Xinhua News Agency, December 14th, Tokyo Dispatch: The first group of 975 Korean residents returning from Japan left Niigata this afternoon aboard two Soviet ships, bound for Chongjin in northern Korea.

　　Four thousand people went to the dock to see them off, including Hatanaka Masaharu, Chairman of the Japan-Korea Association; Hozumi Kei, Secretary-General of the Association for Assisting the Return of Korean Residents in Japan; Okada Muneyuki, representative of the Japan Socialist Party; Hakamada Satomi, representative of the Japanese Communist Party; Kitamura Kazuo, Governor of Niigata Prefecture; and Watanabe Kotaro, Mayor of Niigata City.

　　The returning Korean residents and those who came to see them off threw paper streamers to each other while saying goodbye loudly. The returning Korean residents and the Koreans who came to see them off also sang songs praising Premier Kim Il-sung loudly. When the ships left the dock, a burst of cheers erupted.

　　Earlier, a farewell meeting was held at the dock. Hatanaka Masaharu, speaking on behalf of the three Japanese organizations participating in the work of supporting the return of Korean residents, said at the meeting that they would make further efforts to support the work of the return of Korean residents until this work is completed.

　　Lee Il-kyung, head of the delegation of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said in his speech that the Koreans will never forget the friendship shown by the Japanese people in supporting the work of the return of Korean residents after they leave this country.

　　Lee Il-kyung and Kasai Kaji, Vice-President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, signed a document this afternoon regarding the transfer of returning Korean residents by Japan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang Dispatch: As the date of the return of Korean residents from Japan draws nearer, the people of northern Korea are making all preparations with full enthusiasm and deep fraternal love to welcome their compatriots returning from overseas.

　　According to the agreement between the Red Cross Societies of Korea and Japan regarding the return of Korean residents from Japan, Chongjin and Rajin are the ports where Korean residents returning from Japan will land. Now, a spacious and bright large lounge with a construction area of 3,200 square meters has been built near the docks of these two ports.

　　Cities and villages in Chongjin and Rajin, as well as other places in northern Korea, have prepared houses for the returning Korean residents from Japan. In the new houses prepared for them by people from all walks of life in Chongjin and Rajin, the kang beds are covered with beautiful kang paper, the stoves are installed with pots, and the houses also have utensils such as buckets, kitchen knives, and cutting boards. Jiachuan County, South Pyongan Province, has prepared 140 houses for Korean residents returning from Japan. The workers of the Jiachuan Brick and Tile Factory built a three-story building that can accommodate 30 households for them. The members of the Shantou Agricultural Cooperative in Longchuan County, North Pyongan Province, have also built 40 new houses, hoping that Korean residents from Japan will come to them as new members.

　　Local farms have already studied methods to teach technology to Korean residents returning from Japan who will be working there, and some farm personnel have already been assigned to this task.

　　The Ministry of Education and Culture of Korea has instructed schools in various places to arrange for the children of returning Korean residents in Japan to attend school according to the schools and classes they attended in Japan. Students who do not speak Korean can also be gathered together to study Korean for a period of time.

    首批旅日朝侨启程回国
    朝鲜北部人民满腔热情准备迎接海外同胞归来
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：从日本回国的第一批朝鲜侨民九百七十五人今天下午乘两艘苏联船离开了新潟去朝鲜北部清津。
    有四千人到码头送行，其中包括日朝协会理事长畑中政春、旅日朝鲜人归国协助协会干事长帆足计、日本社会党代表冈田宗司、日本共产党代表袴田里见、新潟县知事北村一男、新潟市市长渡边浩太郎。
    归国朝侨和送行的人们在高声道别中互相抛掷了纸带。归国朝侨和送行的朝鲜人还高声唱起了颂赞金日成首相的歌曲。当轮船离开码头的时候，响起了一阵阵的欢呼声。
    早些时候，在码头上举行了一个告别会。畑中政春代表三个参加支援朝侨回国工作的日本组织在会上讲话时表示，他们还要作进一步的努力，来支持朝鲜侨民回国的工作，直到这个工作结束为止。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国红十字会代表团团长李一卿致辞说，朝鲜人在离开这个国家之后将永远不会忘记日本人民在支援朝侨回国的工作中所表示的友谊。
    李一卿和日本红十字会副会长葛西嘉资今天下午签署了一项关于日本移交归国朝侨的文件。
    新华社平壤电　随着旅日朝侨归国的日期日益接近，朝鲜北部人民正以满腔热情和高度的同胞友爱，做好一切准备工作，来迎接从海外归来的同胞。
    根据朝日两国红十字会关于旅日朝侨归国的协议，清津和罗津为旅日朝侨归国时登陆的港口。现在这两个港口的码头附近都建立了一座有三千二百平方米建筑面积的宽敞明亮的大休息室。
    清津和罗津以及朝鲜北部其他地方的城市和乡村，都为即将归来的旅日侨胞准备好了住宅。清津市和罗津市的各界人民为他们准备的新住宅中，炕上糊上了漂亮的炕纸，灶上安好了锅，住宅内还有水桶、菜刀、砧板等用具。平安南道价川郡为旅日朝侨准备了一百四十户的住宅。价川砖瓦厂的职工为他们盖了一幢能容纳三十户的三层楼房。平安北道龙川郡山头农业社的社员们，也新建了四十幢新住宅，希望旅日侨胞到他们那里当新社员。
    各地农场都已经研究好向即将到它们那里工作的旅日侨胞传授技术的方法，有的农场人员已经在这方面分了工。
    朝鲜的教育文化省已指示各地学校，根据归国旅日朝侨子女在日本时所上的学校和班级，安排他们就学。不会朝鲜语的学生还可以集中起来学习一个时期的朝语。
