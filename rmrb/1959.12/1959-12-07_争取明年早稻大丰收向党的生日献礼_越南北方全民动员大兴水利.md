Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th - In order to strive for a bumper early rice harvest next year as a gift to the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Labor Party, the "All People Building Water Conservancy" movement in the vast rural areas of North Vietnam is unfolding vigorously.

Under the leadership of the Labor Party, the people in the Northwest Region of North Vietnam have gradually overcome the habit of planting only one crop a year for thousands of years and the idea of "relying on heaven". In the past few years, they have built and renovated thousands of kilometers of irrigation canals and hundreds of lakes, ponds, and wells. Recently, more than 400 water sources have been discovered in areas such as Moc Chau, Thuan Chau, Van Chan, Mai Son, Shen Yuan, and Mang La. The people here are building hundreds of reservoirs using various mountain streams. The people of Song Zhou are making full use of river water sources and striving to expand the early rice planting area to two and a half times that of last year. Hu Tou Township in Phong Tho Chau renovated a dry canal that had been silted up for more than 20 years, doubling the early rice planting area. Some agricultural cooperatives have also turned all their arable land into double-cropping fields due to good water conservancy work.

After a major debate on the "water conservancy issue," the people of Ninh Binh Province gained a deeper understanding of the policy of "water storage as the main focus, people-run as the main force, and small-scale as the main type." Therefore, they have confidently devoted themselves to the battle of building water conservancy. From October 21 to November 25 alone, they excavated nearly 400,000 cubic meters of earth and stone and built 1,099 water conservancy projects with a total length of 300 kilometers. Many townships completed the equivalent of the entire year's workload last year in just one month.

Due to the good water conservancy work, the water storage capacity in Ninh Binh Province is generally higher than last year. Except for some areas, most areas have a water storage capacity of 10 to 60 centimeters in their arable land. During the same period last year, 11,000 hectares of arable land in the province were suffering from drought. The people of Yi'an Province are also vigorously engaged in water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and the improvement of agricultural tools, striving to do a good job in winter and spring production. At present, 172 townships and two mountainous counties in the province have formulated water conservancy plans, and 15,000 people are engaged in renovating water diversion ditches. The amount of earthwork excavated for water conservancy projects in the province has approached 120,000 cubic meters.

### 争取明年早稻大丰收向党的生日献礼  越南北方全民动员大兴水利

    争取明年早稻大丰收向党的生日献礼
    越南北方全民动员大兴水利
    新华社河内5日电　为了争取来年早稻大丰收，作为向劳动党建党三十周年的献礼，越南北方广大农村的“全民办水利”运动，正在风起云涌、轰轰烈烈地展开。
    越南北方西北区的人民在劳动党的领导下逐渐克服了千百年来只种植一季作物的习惯和“靠天”思想，几年来兴修和整修了上千公里长的灌溉渠道和数以百计的湖、塘、水井等。最近在木州、顺州、文珍、梅山、申渊、芒罗等地发现了四百多处水源。这里的人民群众正利用各个山涧修起数以百计的水库。嵩州人民充分利用河流的水源，争取把早稻种植面积扩大到去年的两倍半。风土州胡透乡修整淤塞了二十多年的干渠，把早稻种植面积扩大了一倍。有些农业社也因搞好了水利工作，使全部耕地变成双季田。
    宁平省人民经过关于“水利问题”的大辩论后，对“蓄水为主、民办为主、小型为主”的方针，有了进一步的认识，因此信心百倍地投入了兴修水利战斗。他们仅在10月21日至11月25日，就挖了近四十万个土石方，修了一千零九十九处水利工程，这些工程全长达三百公里。许多乡仅在一个月的时间内就完成了相当于去年全年的工作量。
    由于水利工作作得好，宁平省目前各地蓄水量一般比去年多，除了部分地区之外，大部分地区耕地蓄水量都达十至六十厘米，而去年同期，全省有一万一千公顷耕地正在受旱。宜安省人民也在大搞水利、积肥、改进农具，力争搞好冬春生产。目前，全省已经有一百七十二个乡和两个山区的县订好水利规划，一万五千人正在展开整修引水沟渠，全省兴修水利所挖的土方已接近十二万个。
