New Scenes of the Grassland
By our reporter Miji Dedaoerji

Things have changed, they've really changed,
Millennia of nomadism turned to settlement;
Cattle and sheep in countless numbers, descendants filling the halls with endless laughter;
Flowers of happiness bloom all over the grassland, thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

This is a folk song popular on the Ulanqab grassland of Inner Mongolia. It describes the enormous changes in production and life of the Mongolian herdsmen after ending their life of moving from place to place in search of water and pasture for thousands of years.

On December 5th, the reporter visited the settlement of the Xilamulin Ranch. It is surrounded by mountains, with lush water and grass. A river called Xilamulin flows through the ranch and into the distance. The river surface is already frozen. On the north bank of the river are buildings and yurts, as well as many fixed livestock sheds. In a threshing ground in the middle of the village, more than a dozen herdsmen are busy threshing feed. The village has bright and clean windows, and the sounds of chickens and dogs can be heard. This is a settlement of the Ulan Tug People's Commune - Zhong'e Ke pastoral village.

The party branch secretary of the pastoral village, Comrade Handema (Mongolian), is an enthusiastic middle-aged herdsman woman. She said that the 28 herdsmen households living in this village were semi-nomadic and semi-settled before liberation. After liberation, the village's livestock has more than doubled, fifteen herdsmen households have built thirty-five new houses, and the remaining thirteen households have also renovated their old houses from the semi-settled period. Since then, all the herdsmen in the village have completely settled down, and the life of the herdsmen has changed.

When we visited the herdsman Uliji Jinjia's home, a completely different family life scene from the nomadic period appeared before us. The residence of the herdsman Uliji Jinjia is a large five-room house facing south, which is their bedroom and guest room. There are also two kitchens and two warehouses on the east and west sides. Fixed cattle and sheep sheds and stables have also been built near the house. The sunny side of the house has bright windows with glass. The inside is particularly clean, with a ceiling and a heated kang. A portrait of Chairman Mao hangs on the front wall, with a row of wardrobes below. The kang is covered with mats and felt, and there are six or seven floral quilts. The room is heated by a stove, which is very warm. Two children, wearing lined clothes, are playing on the kang without feeling cold. At this time, it is already a severe cold season of more than ten degrees below zero outside.

Before liberation, Uliji Jinjia worked as a long-term laborer for more than 30 years for herd owners and wealthy households. After liberation, the life of Uliji Jinjia's family got better day by day. Starting in 1952, he added and repaired houses, and built fixed sheds for livestock. In a few years, he completely settled down. After settling down, Uliji Jinjia's family no longer moved with the livestock like in the nomadic period. Women give birth while pregnant in the settlement, and both mother and child are very safe. Uliji Jinjia has six children, three of whom were born after liberation. In 1956, the eldest son got married, and Uliji Jinjia had two more little grandsons. Now, Uliji Jinjia's family has eleven people. Such a large family is still rare on the grassland. After settling down, Uliji Jinjia's livestock suffered very few losses, and in six or seven years, it has more than doubled. Now, in addition to more than 200 sheep and more than 120 cattle and horses entering the commune, he also keeps dairy cows, riding horses, and meat sheep for his own use. His wife, Na Re, raises two pigs and several chickens on the settlement, which was impossible during nomadic times. This year, the family's income has more than doubled compared to last year. Uliji Jinjia happily said: "Now that we are settled and communalized, we herdsmen have both people and meat and noodles, we have everything to wear, and our lives have changed greatly!"

On the vast winter pasture, the reporter made a tour. In each residential area, herdsmen have built houses and a large number of livestock sheds, and there is a scene of prosperity everywhere. Comrade Longtao (Mongolian), the secretary of the commune party committee, told me that with the gradual realization of settlement, and after the state provided free treatment for various diseases to the herdsmen, the population of the commune grew particularly fast. Before liberation, the entire commune averaged only one child for every three married women; now, the average is four children for every married woman. Especially after the people's commune, livestock has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Now, the total number of livestock in the commune has increased by 1.5 times compared to the time of liberation. This year, herdsmen have built more than 100 new permanent warm livestock sheds and 14 large warm pens on the settlements, plus the original warm sheds and warm pens, all the livestock in the commune have fully realized three modernizations: calf sheds for young livestock, semi-sheds for female livestock, and warm pens for cattle and sheep. Livestock no longer fear blizzards during winter and spring. Moreover, on average, a well has been drilled for every 100 livestock, realizing the well network of the four seasons' pasture.

Before liberation, the herdsmen here could not farm. In recent years, with the construction of settlements, herdsmen have learned and done with the help of Han farmers, and planted feed on the pastures every year. This year, the commune planted more than 10,000 mu of various feed crops, harvesting 1.5 million jin of grain feed. The herdsmen living on this grassland ended the history of relying on the state to supply grain feed this year. After leaving enough rations and livestock feed for the whole year, the herdsmen also sold 200,000 jin of grain to the state (last year the state supplied them with 700,000 jin of grain feed). There are small grain feed processing plants, iron and wood factories, and sewing factories in the commune's central point and various settlements. This year, the sewing factory made 4,300 pieces of clothing for the herdsmen. Now, the herdsmen in the commune also raise more than 340 pigs and more than 10,000 chickens. Herdsmen's homes are stocked with cabbage, potatoes, and some also pickle pickles. In addition to drinking milk tea every day, they also eat mutton stir-fries and rice, making their lives rich and diverse.

In Zhong'e Ke pastoral village, I also visited the village's pastoral mechanization experimental station. This station was established this year with the help of the state. It now has two tractors and some new agricultural machinery. More tractors, hay rakes, and shearing machines will be added next year. The herdsmen happily told me that now that we are settled and communalized, our animal husbandry will soon be mechanized. (Attached pictures)

    草原新景
    本报记者　密吉德道尔基
    变了，变了，真变了，
    千年游牧变定居；
    牛羊成群数不尽，子孙满堂笑不完；
    草原开遍幸福花儿，感谢毛主席共产党。
    这是流行在内蒙古乌兰察布草原的一首歌谣。它描述了蒙古族牧民，结束千百年来逐水草而居的生活以后，生产、生活上所起的巨大变化。
    12月5日，记者访问了这里的西拉姆林牧场定居地。这儿群山环绕，水草丰美。有一条叫西拉姆林的河，穿过牧场，流向远方。河面已经封冰，河北岸，是一幢幢房屋和一些蒙古包，还有许多牲畜固定棚圈。在牧村中间的一个谷场上，十多个牧民正忙着给饲料脱粒。村里，窗明几净，鸡犬相闻。这里就是乌兰图格人民公社的一个定居地——忠额克牧村。
    牧村党支部书记罕德玛（蒙古族）同志，是位热情的中年牧民妇女。她说，居住在这个牧村的二十八户牧民，解放前都是半游牧半定居的。解放后，全村的牲畜增长了二倍多，十五户牧民盖了三十五间新房，其余十三户也把半定居时期的旧房子，修整一新。从此，全村牧民完全定居了下来，牧民的生活就变了样。
    当我们到乌力吉金嘎牧民家作客时，面前出现了一副完全和游牧时期不同的家庭生活景象。乌力吉金嘎牧民的住宅，有一幢座北朝南的五间大房，这就是他们的卧室和客房。东西两侧，还有两间厨房和两间仓库。靠下边又修建了固定的牛羊棚圈和马厩。房屋的向阳处，都是明窗，镶着玻璃。里面特别干净，有天棚、火炕。正面墙上挂着毛主席像，下面是一排衣柜。炕上铺着席子和毛毡，放着六、七床花被褥。屋里生着火炉，暖烘烘的。有两个小孩，穿着夹衣在炕上玩耍，也毫无寒意。而这时，外面已是零下十多度的严寒季节了。
    乌力吉金嘎，解放前给牧主和富裕户，扛了三十多年长工。解放后，乌力吉金嘎一家的生活，一天天好了起来。从1952年开始，他就增建和修建房屋，又给牲畜建筑了固定棚圈。不几年，就完全定居下来。定居后，乌力吉金嘎一家，再不像游牧时期那样，跟着畜群游动了。妇女怀孕生产，都在定居地，母子很安全。乌力吉金嘎有六个子女，其中三个都是解放后生的。1956年，大儿子结了婚，乌力吉金嘎又抱上了两个小孙孙。现在，乌力吉金嘎一家，已有十一口人了。这样人口众多的牧户，在草原上还是稀少的。定居后，乌力吉金嘎的牲畜，损失很少，六、七年中，就增加了一倍多。现在，他除了入公社的二百多只羊、一百二十多头牛马外，还自留有奶牛、乘马和食用肉羊。他的妻子娜热，在定居地上喂了两口猪和几只鸡，这在游牧时候是办不到的。今年，他们一家的收入，比去年增加了一倍多。乌力吉金嘎高兴地说：“现在定居了，公社化了，我们牧民既有人，又有肉面，穿甚有甚，生活可大变了！”
    在广阔的冬季牧场上，记者作了一次巡礼。在每个居民点上，牧民们都兴建了房屋和大量牲畜棚圈，到处是一片繁荣景象。公社党委书记龙套（蒙古族）同志告诉我，随着定居的逐步实现，和国家给牧民免费治疗各种疾病后，全社人口增长的特别快。解放前，全社平均每三个已婚妇女，才有一个小孩；现在，平均每个结婚妇女，就有四个子女。特别是人民公社化后，牲畜获得空前大丰收。现在，全社牲畜总头数，比解放当时增长了一点五倍。今年牧民们在定居地上，又新建了一百多间永久性的牲畜暖棚和十四个大型暖圈，加上原有暖棚暖圈，全社所有牲畜，全部实现了三化：仔畜暖棚化，母畜半棚化，牛羊暖圈化。牲畜过冬度春，再也不怕暴风雪了。而且，平均每一百头牲畜，还打了一眼水井，实现了四季牧场的井网化。
    解放前，这里的牧民是不会种地的，近几年，随着定居地的建设，牧民们在汉族农民的帮助下，边学边做，每年都在牧场上种了饲料。今年全社种了各种饲料作物一万多亩，收获了一百五十万斤粮食饲料。生活在这个草原上的牧民，今年就结束了依靠国家供应粮食饲料的历史。牧民们留足全年口粮和牲畜饲料外，还向国家出售了二十万斤粮食（去年国家还供应了他们七十万斤粮食饲料）。在公社中心点和各定居地上，都有小型粮食饲料加工厂、铁木厂和缝纫厂。今年，缝纫厂就为牧民做了四千三百多件衣服。现在，全社牧民还养了三百四十多口猪、一万多只鸡。牧民的家里，都贮备了白菜、马铃薯，有的还腌了咸菜，他们每天除了喝牛奶茶，还吃到羊肉炒菜和饭，生活丰富多样。
    在忠额克牧村，我还参观了村里的牧业机械化试验站。这个站是今年国家帮助牧民建立的，现有两台拖拉机和一些新式农业机械。明年还要增加一批拖拉机、打搂草机和剪毛机。牧民们高兴地告诉我，定居了，公社化了，我们的畜牧业也快机械化了。（附图片）
