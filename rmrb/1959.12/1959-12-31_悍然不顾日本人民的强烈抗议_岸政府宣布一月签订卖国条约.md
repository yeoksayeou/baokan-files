Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 30th: The Foreign Ministry of the Kishi Nobusuke government announced today that the Japanese and American governments will sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in Washington on January 19th of next year.

The U.S. government simultaneously announced the above decision in Washington. The U.S. had originally planned to sign the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the Kishi Nobusuke government in February of this year. Under the circumstances of the Japanese people bravely launching a surging struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty," the action of signing this treaty was delayed. The fact that the Kishi Nobusuke government brazenly announced the conclusion of this aggressive military alliance with the United States shows that it is determined to drag Japan onto the road of following the United States in carrying out war adventures, regardless of the opposition of the Japanese people.

The Foreign Ministry also announced that the Japanese delegation, led by Kishi Nobusuke himself, will depart for Washington on January 16th of next year. At the cabinet meeting held yesterday, the Kishi Nobusuke government had formally formed this delegation.

In assembling this large delegation of thirty people, Kishi Nobusuke tried his best to win over representatives of some factions within the ruling party to participate in the delegation, attempting to have the factions share the political responsibility for signing this military treaty that betrays the national interests of Japan. However, Vice President of the Liberal Democratic Party and anti-mainstream member Banboku Ohno refused to participate in the delegation. The members of the delegation finally determined by Kishi Nobusuke also included representatives of Japanese monopoly capital, whose expansionist ambitions are becoming increasingly blatant.

This large delegation, personally led by Kishi Nobusuke, consists of five plenipotentiary members, three advisors, and twenty-two attendants. In addition to Kishi Nobusuke, the plenipotentiary members also include Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party Kojiro Ishii, President of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Tadashi Adachi, and Japanese Ambassador to the United States Koichiro Asakai.

According to Kyodo News, after signing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Kishi Nobusuke intends to hold talks with U.S. President Eisenhower, U.S. Secretary of State Herter, and others to "frankly express his views on how Japan will implement policies after the new security treaty is approved."

　　悍然不顾日本人民的强烈抗议
    岸政府宣布一月签订卖国条约
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府外务省今天宣布，日美两国政府订于明年1月19日在华盛顿签订新的日美“安全条约”。
    美国政府在华盛顿同时宣布了上述决定。美国原定在今年2月同岸信介政府签订新的日美“安全条约”。在日本人民英勇展开汹涌澎湃的反对修改“安全条约”的斗争的情况下，签订这项条约的行动拖延了下来。岸信介政府悍然宣布同美国缔结这项侵略性军事同盟的事实表明，它决心不顾日本人民的反对，要把日本拖上追随美国进行战争冒险的道路。
    外务省同时宣布，由岸信介亲自率领的日本代表团将在明年1月16日启程前往华盛顿。在昨天举行的内阁会议上，岸信介政府已经正式组成了这个代表团。
    在拼凑这个由三十人组成的庞大代表团过程中，岸信介极力拉拢执政党内一些派系的代表参加代表团，企图使各派系分担同美国签订这项出卖日本民族利益的军事条约的政治责任。但是，自由民主党副总裁、反主流派成员大野伴睦拒绝参加代表团。岸信介最后确定的代表团成员中，还包括了扩张野心日益露骨的日本垄断资本的代表。
    这个由岸信介亲自率领的庞大的代表团由全权委员五人、顾问三人、随员二十二人组成。除了岸信介以外，全权委员还包括外务相藤山爱一郎、自由民主党总务会长石井光次郎、日本商工会议所会长足立正、日本驻美国大使朝海浩一郎。
    据共同社报道，岸信介打算在签订新的日美“安全条约”以后，同美国总统艾森豪威尔、美国国务卿赫脱等举行会谈，来“坦率地表明他对日本在批准新的安全条约以后怎样执行政策问题的意见”。
