　　 本报讯　新疆特克斯县本着统一规划，合理使用，互相协作，共同跃进的精神，合理调剂冬季牧场，为境内五十多万头牲畜安全过冬作好了准备。
　　特克斯是伊犁的主要牧业县，境内水草丰茂，草原辽阔。但近几年来，特别是去年公社化后，由于牲畜发展很快，草场感到不够使用。加以过去缺乏规划，草场余缺不匀、使用不合理现象就越明显了。为了适应牧业生产日益发展的需要，使国营牧场和人民公社的畜群都能有安身之地，早在今年7月间，特克斯县委就召集有关单位，研究了草场问题，并组织了草场管理委员会，由县委副书记瓦力斯带领工作组，深入山区进行勘查。同时，对各公社、牧场的草场使用情况进行了调查。在这个基础上，县委本着统一规划，合理使用，挖掘潜力，地尽其利的精神，对四季牧场作了初步规划。各单位也发挥了共产主义协作精神，在有利于生产发展的原则下，按实际需要进行了调剂，从第二、三、四、五公社过去共同占有的包扎得勒腾出了二百多个冬牧场（每个可容纳牲畜五百只），让给国营牧场和其他公社；由哈拉郎及芃其克里克山区腾出三十多个牧场，让给草场不够使用的伊宁、昭苏、尼勒克、巩留等县。同时，在包扎等地新开辟了二百多个冬牧场，分别拨给两个国营牧场及两个冬牧场少的公社。这样，全县的冬牧场由过去的六百多个增加到现在的八百零五个，全县五个公社及国营牧场和邻县的牲畜都有了冬牧场，基本上解决了冬草场不足的问题。
　在调剂冬牧场的同时，各单位进一步发扬了协作精神，对冬牧场进行了必要的基本建设。截至11月上旬，八百多个冬牧场都整修或新建了棚圈，在通往包扎冬牧场和克其分拾台等山险地区，新开了两条大道，在毛因台和沙勒考甫修了两条水渠，第一次作到了每个冬牧场都有棚圈、饮水和便道，为牲畜安全转移和过冬创造了条件。
　　本报西宁12日电　青海省果洛藏族自治州广大牧民在各类牲畜已经实现了满膘、满怀的基础上，正在抓紧当前有利时机，突击做好打储饲草、修棚搭圈等的防冻保畜工作，力争全部牲畜安全度过严冬。
　　入冬以来，自治州各人民公社坚决贯彻执行了自治州党委作好防冻保畜工作，保证超额完成全州牲畜增产任务的指示，普遍成立了冬季畜牧业生产指挥部，加强领导；各县、各人民公社纷纷抽调大批干部深入生产队，深入畜群，一面参加劳动，一面进行具体领导，有力地推动了防冻保畜工作的迅速展开。目前，全州已经有许多公社做到了大畜有圈、幼畜有棚，各种牲畜冬春不缺草。达日县唐欠沟公社在实现了牲畜满膘、满怀以后，又妥善安排了劳力，一面抓紧牲畜饲养放牧管理，继续保膘、保胎；一面突击进行打储饲草，修棚搭圈，只几天功夫，全社就实现了大畜有圈，幼畜有棚，平均每头牲畜储草一百多斤。
　　今年，全州各族牧民根据“夏膘长肉、秋膘长油，有膘有油，冬春不愁”的经验，在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，从8、9两月以来，就采取了适当划小畜群，固定专人放牧，建立和健全生产责任制度等措施，大抓夏膘、秋膘。截至目前，全州各类牲畜已经消灭了三类膘，一类膘的达到了95％。由于牲畜膘肥体壮，适龄的母畜发情旺盛，全州各类牲畜受胎率普遍达到90％以上，其中母牛受胎率高达96.45％。
　　目前，果洛草原上正是母羊产羔的季节。各地人民公社生产队，正在采取各种措施，一面赶修羊羔暖棚，接羔暖炕和准备哺乳器、接羔袋等接羔育幼用具；一面给产羔母羊群增添了放牧人员，并召开座谈会交流母羊管理、接羔育幼经验。
　
Xinhua News Agency:
　　 Xinjiang Tekes County, adhering to the spirit of unified planning, rational utilization, mutual cooperation, and common leap forward, has rationally adjusted winter pastures and made preparations for the safe wintering of more than 500,000 livestock within the county.
　　Tekes is a major livestock county in Ili, with abundant water and grass and vast grasslands. However, in recent years, especially after the communization last year, the rapid development of livestock has led to a perceived shortage of grassland. Coupled with the lack of planning in the past, the uneven distribution and irrational use of grassland have become increasingly apparent. In order to meet the growing needs of livestock production and ensure that livestock herds of state-owned farms and people's communes have a place to settle down, as early as July this year, the Tekes County Party Committee convened relevant units to study the grassland issue and organized a Grassland Management Committee, led by Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, Walis, to conduct in-depth investigations in the mountainous areas. At the same time, the grassland usage of various communes and farms was investigated. Based on this, the County Party Committee, adhering to the spirit of unified planning, rational utilization, tapping potential, and making the most of the land, made preliminary plans for the four-season pastures. Various units also demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation and made adjustments according to actual needs under the principle of benefiting production development. More than 200 winter pastures were vacated from Baozha Dele, which was jointly occupied by the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Communes in the past (each capable of accommodating 500 livestock), and given to state-owned farms and other communes. More than 30 pastures were vacated from the Haralang and Pengqi Kelike mountainous areas and given to Yining, Zhaosu, Nileke, Gongliu, and other counties that lacked grassland. At the same time, more than 200 new winter pastures were opened up in Baozha and other places and allocated to two state-owned farms and two communes with fewer winter pastures. In this way, the number of winter pastures in the county increased from more than 600 in the past to the current 805, and livestock from the five communes, state-owned farms, and neighboring counties in the county all had winter pastures, basically solving the problem of insufficient winter pasture.
　　While adjusting winter pastures, various units further promoted the spirit of cooperation and carried out necessary basic construction on winter pastures. As of early November, more than 800 winter pastures have been renovated or newly built with sheds and corrals. Two new main roads have been opened in the mountainous areas leading to Baozha winter pastures and Keqi Fenshitai, and two canals have been built in Maointai and Shale Kaupu, making it possible for the first time for each winter pasture to have sheds, water, and access roads, creating conditions for the safe transfer and wintering of livestock.
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 12th: The broad masses of herdsmen in the Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, on the basis of having achieved full fatness and full pregnancy of all kinds of livestock, are seizing the current favorable opportunity to rush to do a good job in anti-freezing and animal protection work such as cutting and storing fodder, repairing sheds and building corrals, striving to ensure that all livestock safely spend the severe winter.
　　Since the beginning of winter, the people's communes in the autonomous prefecture have resolutely implemented the instructions of the autonomous prefecture's Party Committee to do a good job in preventing freezing and protecting livestock, and to ensure the over-fulfillment of the prefecture's livestock production increase task. Winter Animal Husbandry Production Headquarters have been generally established to strengthen leadership. Counties and people's communes have transferred large numbers of cadres to go deep into production teams and into livestock herds, participating in labor while providing specific leadership, vigorously promoting the rapid development of anti-freezing and animal protection work. At present, many communes in the prefecture have achieved that large livestock have corrals, young livestock have sheds, and all kinds of livestock do not lack grass in winter and spring. Tangqiangou Commune in Dari County, after achieving full fatness and full pregnancy of livestock, also properly arranged labor, seizing the management of livestock feeding and grazing on the one hand, continuing to protect fatness and protect pregnancy; on the other hand, rushing to cut and store fodder, repair sheds and build corrals. In just a few days, the entire commune achieved that large livestock have corrals, young livestock have sheds, and an average of more than 100 jin of grass is stored per head of livestock.
　　This year, herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the prefecture, based on the experience of "summer fat grows meat, autumn fat grows oil, with fat and oil, winter and spring are not worried," under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, since August and September, have adopted measures such as appropriately reducing the size of livestock herds, assigning fixed personnel to graze, and establishing and improving the production responsibility system, vigorously grasping summer fat and autumn fat. As of now, all kinds of livestock in the prefecture have eliminated Category Three fatness, and Category One fatness has reached 95%. Due to the fatness and strength of livestock, suitable-aged female animals have vigorous estrus, and the pregnancy rate of all kinds of livestock in the prefecture has generally reached more than 90%, of which the pregnancy rate of cows is as high as 96.45%.
　　At present, it is the lambing season for ewes on the Golog Grassland. People's commune production teams in various places are taking various measures, on the one hand, rushing to repair lambing warm sheds, receiving lambing warm kangs, and preparing lambing and rearing supplies such as feeding devices and lambing bags; on the other hand, increasing the number of herders for lambing ewe flocks and holding symposiums to exchange experiences in ewe management, lambing and rearing.
