Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 29th: The 34th Ordinary Session of the Japanese Diet opened today. The focus of the struggle between the democratic forces of Japan and the Nobusuke Kishi group in this 150-day Ordinary Session of the Diet will be concentrated on the discussion and ratification of the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

After holding the opening ceremony today, the Japanese Diet announced the start of the New Year recess. The session will be postponed until January 28th to resume. The Nobusuke Kishi government made the above arrangement for the session of the Ordinary Diet so that the delegation led by Nobusuke Kishi himself could sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the U.S. government in Washington around January 19th, in order to force the Diet to approve this aggressive military treaty after the Diet resumes.

In order to accelerate the arms expansion and war preparations and strengthen the suppression of the Japanese people in accordance with the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Nobusuke Kishi group also attempted to pass the 1960 fiscal year's national budget and reactionary laws prohibiting demonstrations and parades around the Diet in this Ordinary Session of the Diet.

The Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party have stated that they will launch a more vigorous struggle against the signing and ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" during the Ordinary Session of the Diet. Asahi Broadcasting Corporation of Japan said that when the Ordinary Session of the Diet deliberates on the issue of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," "fierce conflicts will occur between the ruling and opposition parties."

　　日本国会平时会议开幕
    “安全条约”问题将是斗争焦点
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本第三十四次国会平时会议在今天开幕。日本民主力量同岸信介集团在这次为期一百五十天的国会平时会议上的斗争焦点将集中于讨论和批准修改后的日美“安全条约”问题上。
    日本国会今天举行了开幕仪式后，宣布开始新年休会。会议将延至1月28日恢复。岸信介政府对这次国会平时会议的会期作出上述安排，是为了使由岸信介亲自率领的代表团于1月19日前后在华盛顿同美国政府签订新的日美“安全条约”，以便在国会复会后强使国会批准这项侵略性军事条约。
    为了根据新的日美“安全条约”加速扩军备战和加强对日本人民的镇压，岸信介集团还企图在这次国会平时会议上通过1960财政年度的国家预算和禁止在国会周围示威游行的反动法律。
    日本共产党、社会党已经表示要在国会平时会议期间展开更加猛烈的反对签订和批准新的日美“安全条约”的斗争。日本朝日广播公司电台说，预料国会平时会议审议新的日美“安全条约”问题时，“执政党和在野党将发生猛烈的冲突”。
