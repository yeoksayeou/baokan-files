Actively Develop Woody Oil Production
By Our Staff Commentator

In recent years, China's oil production has increased significantly, but it still cannot meet the needs of the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's living standards. In order to quickly solve the oil problem, in addition to actively developing animal oil and herbaceous plant oil production, we must also vigorously develop and improve woody oil production.

Woody oil materials have many advantages. Woody oil crops generally grow in mountainous and hilly areas and do not compete with agriculture for land; the investment and labor required to develop woody oil are small, but the returns are large, which has a positive effect on revitalizing the mountain economy and increasing the income of communes and members; woody oil crops all have the characteristic of one planting and multiple harvests for many years. Once the trees are planted, they can bear fruit for decades or even hundreds of years; woody oil crops have a strong ability to resist natural disasters and have a relatively stable yield. Therefore, developing woody oil is of great significance.

The masses in mountainous areas have rich experience in managing woody oil. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, the masses have launched a campaign for rapid growth and high yield of trees, which has not only achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of woody oil, but also created rich experience in high yield; the realization of communization has opened up broad prospects for the development of woody oil. These are all favorable conditions for developing woody oil production.

There are many types of woody oil in China. At present, we should mainly focus on the development of oil-tea camellia and walnuts.

Oil-tea camellia is distributed in various provinces in southern China and is the main edible oil in some provinces. In 1958, the national tea oil production increased by 3.6 times compared with 1950. However, at present, a quarter of the 35 million mu of existing mature forests in the country are in a state of disuse and semi-disuse. It is an urgent task to quickly reclaim these abandoned oil-tea camellia forests. Experience has proven that once abandoned oil-tea camellia forests are reclaimed, production can be increased by 20%-30% in the same year and the following year, and the yield can be increased several times after the third year. It is hoped that all localities will deeply plow all the abandoned oil-tea camellia forests once this winter to lay a solid foundation for a greater bumper harvest of oil-tea camellia next year.

In order to ensure that the production of oil-tea camellia continues to rise, management must also be strengthened. New young forests can bear fruit early as long as they are properly nurtured. Now is a good time for winter afforestation, and all localities should actively build timber forests and protective forests, while vigorously building oil-tea camellia forests. All places with the conditions should establish woody oil production bases in a planned way.

All localities should vigorously plant walnuts. Walnut kernels are valuable non-staple foods and have high oil content and good oil quality. Walnut wood is even better. All localities should widely mobilize the masses to launch a walnut planting campaign, not only to build forests in pieces, but also to make full use of the gaps around the houses to plant walnuts.

In addition, tung oil and cypress oil, which are used in industry, are currently in short supply and need to be vigorously developed. Existing mature forests must be strengthened in management to increase production. For the numerous and abundant wild woody oil materials, we should also actively collect and utilize them. This is a new way to increase oil production with great potential. At present, it is the best season for winter afforestation, launching small autumn harvest campaigns and diversified operations. All localities should combine these activities to promote woody oil production. We believe that as long as we thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies and go all out, we will surely be able to complete the task of establishing woody oil production bases, and we will surely be able to strive for a greater bumper harvest of woody oil year after year.

    积极发展木本油料生产
    本报评论员
    几年来，我国油料产量有了很大的增长，但仍不能满足工农业生产发展和人民生活水平提高的需要。为了迅速解决油料问题，除积极发展动物油和草本植物油的生产外，还要大力发展和提高木本油料的生产。
    木本油料有很多优点。木本油料作物一般长在山地和丘陵地区，不与农业争地；发展木本油料所需的投资小、劳力少，而收益大，对繁荣山区经济、增加公社和社员收入有积极作用；木本油料都具有一次栽植多年收获的特点，树栽下后，就能结实几十年甚至上百年；木本油料作物抗御自然灾害的能力较强，产量较稳定。因此，发展木本油料有重大意义。
    山区群众有经营木本油料的丰富经验。特别是大跃进以来，群众开展了林木速生丰产运动，不但获得了木本油料空前的大丰收，而且创造了丰富的丰产经验；公社化的实现，更为木本油料的发展开辟了广阔的前途。这些都是发展木本油料生产的有利条件。
    我国木本油料种类很多，当前主要应抓紧油茶和核桃的发展。
    油茶在我国南方各省都有分布，并且是某些省区的主要食用油。1958年全国茶油比1950年增产了三点六倍。但是，目前在全国三千五百万亩现有成林中，还有四分之一的油茶林处于荒芜和半荒芜状态。迅速把这些荒芜的油茶林垦复过来，是一个迫切的任务。经验证明，荒芜的油茶林一经垦复，当年和次年就能增产20％—30％，第三年后就可提高产量几倍。希望各地在今冬将所有荒芜的油茶林全部深翻一次，为明年油茶更大丰收打下坚实的基础。
    为使油茶产量持续上升，还必须加强经营管理。新造幼林只要抚育得法，可以提前结实。现在正是冬季造林的大好时光，各地应在积极营造用材林、防护林的同时，大力营造油茶林。凡是有条件的地方，都应该有计划地建立木本油料生产基地。
    各地都要大力种核桃。核桃仁是珍贵的副食品，而且含油量高，油质好，核桃树的木材更好。各地应广泛发动群众，开展一个种植核桃运动，不仅要成片营造，还要充分利用四旁隙地种核桃。
    此外，工业用油中的桐油和柏油，目前都很缺乏，需要大力发展；对现有成林，要加强经营管理，提高产量。对于种类繁多、储量丰富的野生木本油料，也应积极采集利用，这是增产油料的一个潜力巨大的新途径。目前，正是冬季造林、开展小秋收运动和多种经营的最好季节，各地应该结合这些活动，把木本油料生产抓起来。我们相信，只要反透右倾，鼓足干劲，就一定能够完成建立木本油料生产基地的任务，就一定能够争取木本油料一年比一年更大的丰收。（附图片）
