Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 24th: This correspondent reports: Czechoslovakia’s capital construction situation is good this year. Of the six hundred and twenty national capital construction projects under construction, one hundred and forty were started this year. Ninety capital construction projects have been completed and put into production this year.

According to the person in charge of capital construction work at the Czechoslovak State Planning Commission, it is expected that the annual capital construction task will be completed at 102%—103%. This year will be the best year for the implementation of the capital construction plan since the liberation of Czechoslovakia.

The total national capital construction investment this year reached 44.6 billion crowns (Czech currency), and the total workload increased by 12% compared with last year. The capital construction investment directly controlled by the central government increased by more than 30% compared with last year.

This year, the state's funds are concentrated on developing metallurgy, power, chemical, and fuel industries, which are the foundation of the national economy. Czechoslovakia's total investment in the metallurgical industry this year reached 2.5 billion crowns. This year, four new projects have been put into production, including smelting equipment with an annual production capacity of 720,000 tons of coke, 300,000 tons of steel, and 220,000 tons of steel products. Currently, fifty-two new metallurgical projects are under construction. The newly built metallurgical projects are all carried out according to the most modern production requirements.

Among the fifty-two power projects under construction, nine have been completed this year, and generating equipment with a capacity of 600,000 kilowatts has been put into production. During the construction process, the cost of capital construction has been greatly reduced due to workers using every possible means. In the past, each kilowatt of generating capacity cost two to three thousand crowns, but this year it only cost one thousand five hundred crowns, greatly saving state funds.

In terms of the fuel industry, thirteen capital construction projects were completed this year, including new mines with an annual output of 3.86 million tons of lignite and 500,000 tons of hard coal. The three major coal mines in Ostrava, the coal and steel center, are also being expanded. After completion, the daily output of these three coal mines will increase by 2,800 tons. In the Bohemian region, six new open-pit coal mines are also under construction.

The chemical industry is increasingly becoming an important link in Czechoslovakia's industrial construction. Currently, there are forty-eight chemical industry projects under construction nationwide, nine of which started construction this year. This year, a factory with an annual output of approximately 2,000 tons of caprolon has been put into production. A factory with an annual output of 2,500 tons of rayon has also been completed. A large-scale synthetic rubber factory and a chemical fertilizer factory are under intense construction. These two factories will each provide 50% of the country's rubber and fertilizer needs.

The characteristic of Czechoslovakia's capital construction this year is that, while accelerating the construction of new projects, it vigorously renovates and updates the equipment capacity of existing factories, implementing the state's proposed policy of being fast, good, and economical. The competition to save capital construction investment and accelerate construction speed, which has been carried out in the capital construction sector, has also brought about a new situation in this year's capital construction. Workers and designers vigorously use advanced technology and design to improve labor efficiency in order to save investment and reduce costs. They have adopted industrialization methods in construction, revised many original design plans, which not only reduced the cost of new engineering construction, but also accelerated the speed of construction.

Due to the development of the movement to save capital construction investment, the capital construction sector has saved 500 million crowns since this summer. The country's construction costs in electrification have been reduced by 15%, cement factory construction costs have been reduced by 35%, power plant construction costs have been reduced by 30% to 50%, and the construction cost of each housing unit has been reduced by 20%.

　　广大职工开展竞赛加快建设速度
    捷今年大批企业投入生产
    新华社布拉格24日电　本社记者报道：捷克斯洛伐克今年基本建设形势良好。正在施工的六百二十项全国性基本建设工程中，有一百四十项是今年动工兴建的。今年完工投入生产的基本建设工程就有九十项。
    据捷克斯洛伐克国家计划委员会基本建设工作负责人说，预计今年全年基本建设任务将完成102％—103％。今年将是捷克斯洛伐克解放以来基本建设计划执行得最好的一年。
    今年全国基本建设的总投资达四百四十六亿克朗（捷币名），总工作量比去年多12％。由中央直接掌握的基本建设投资比去年增加了30％以上。
    今年国家的资金集中用于发展作为国民经济基础的冶金、动力、化学和燃料工业等方面。捷克斯洛伐克今年在冶金工业方面的投资总额达二十五亿克朗。今年已有四项新的工程投入生产，其中包括年产七十二万吨焦炭、三十万吨钢和二十二万吨钢材的生产能力的冶炼设备。目前有五十二项新的冶金工程正在建设中。新建的冶金工程都是按照最现代化的生产要求进行的。
    在五十二项正在兴建的动力工程中，今年已经完成了九项，有六十万瓩能力的发电设备已经投入生产。在建设中，由于工人们想尽一切办法，基本建设的成本大大降低了，过去每一瓩的发电能力要花二千到三千克朗，今年只需一千五百克朗，大大节约了国家的资金。
    在燃料工业方面，今年有十三项基本建设工程完工，其中包括年产三百八十六万吨褐煤和五十万吨硬煤的新矿。煤钢中心俄斯特拉发的三座大煤矿也正在进行扩建，完工后，这三座煤矿的日产量将提高二千八百吨。在波希米亚地区，六座新的露天煤矿也正在动工兴建。
    化学工业日益成为捷克斯洛伐克工业建设中的重要环节，目前全国有四十八项化学工业工程在建设中，其中有九项是今年开始动工的。今年一个年产约二千吨卡普隆的工厂已投入了生产。一个年产二千五百吨人造纤维的工厂也已建成。规模巨大的人造橡胶厂和化学肥料厂正在紧张地兴建，这两个工厂都将分别提供全国所需橡胶和化肥的50％。
    今年捷克斯洛伐克基本建设的特点是，在加速新的工程建设的同时，大力改建和更新现有工厂的设备能力，贯彻了国家所提出的又快、又好、又省的方针。在基本建设部门中开展的节约基本建设投资、加快建设速度的竞赛，也使今年的基本建设出现了一个新的局面。工人们和设计人员大力运用先进的技术和设计，提高劳动效率，以达到节约投资和降低成本的目的。他们在基本建设中采用了建筑工业化的办法，修改了许多原来的设计方案，这样不仅降低了新的工程修建的成本，也加快了修建的速度。
    由于节约基本建设投资运动的开展，从今年夏天以来，基本建设部门已经节约了五亿克朗。国家在电气化方面的建筑成本降低了15％，水泥工厂修建方面的成本降低了35％，修建热电站的成本降低30％至50％，每一套住房建筑的成本降低了20％。
