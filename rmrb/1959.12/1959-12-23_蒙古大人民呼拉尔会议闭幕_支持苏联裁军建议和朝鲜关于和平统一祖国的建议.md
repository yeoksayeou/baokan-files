Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 21st: The Fourth Session of the Third Great People's Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic concluded at noon today.

　　The meeting adopted two statements, expressing support for the Soviet Supreme Soviet's appeal to the parliaments of all countries on the issue of complete and thorough disarmament, and for the letter from the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the parliaments of all countries on the peaceful reunification of Korea.

　　The first statement adopted at the meeting stated that the Mongolian people firmly support the unremitting efforts of the Soviet government to ease international tensions, eliminate the "Cold War," and safeguard and consolidate world peace. The Mongolian Great People's Hural supports the Soviet disarmament proposal and is willing to make every possible contribution to the realization of this proposal.

　　The second statement adopted at the meeting said that the letter from the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea to the parliaments of all countries on the peaceful reunification of Korea is of great significance for realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea and consolidating peace in the Far East and the world.

　　The statement said that one of the basic conditions for correctly resolving the Korean question through peaceful means is the complete withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea and the cessation of the American reactionary group's blatant interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people. The Korean question should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. The statement demanded that all foreign troops withdraw from South Korea.

　　At today's meeting, a decree on the payment of livestock products to the state by agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, cooperative members, and other residents was also adopted. The decree stipulates the methods for handing over livestock products.
