　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 20th: The economy of Soviet collective farms is being continuously consolidated and developed. Their public accumulation funds and the degree of public ownership are increasing and improving, exceeding the scope of a single farm, and the economic and production links between farms are expanding.

　　In recent years, the wealth and material and technical foundation of collective farms—public accumulation funds—have undergone significant changes in quantity and scope of use. In 1932, the public accumulation funds of all collective farms in the Soviet Union were less than 5 billion rubles, but by 1958, they exceeded 100 billion rubles. Since this year, the collective farms' public accumulation funds have continued to grow. This year, the growth rate of public accumulation funds in collective farms in the Ukrainian Republic will greatly exceed the average level of the past five years. Due to the growth of public accumulation funds, collective farms have the potential to carry out economic construction on a larger scale. Last year, the investment of collective farms in the Russian Federation reached more than 25 billion rubles, 1.4 times more than in 1957. And from 1955 to 1957, the total funds used by collective farms throughout the Soviet Union for production and cultural construction were only 29.3 billion rubles.

　　Now, the scope of use of collective farms' public accumulation funds has also expanded, and many farms have joined together to establish industrial, agricultural enterprises, and welfare facilities. For example, collective farms in the Ukrainian Republic have also jointly used public accumulation funds to build eight sanatoriums and five hundred and sixty-five schools; another one thousand five hundred schools will be built this year. Collective farms in Belgorod and Ryazan Oblasts of the Russian Federation jointly built one hundred and fifty hospitals and maternity hospitals. Many collective farms have also jointly built or are building joint power stations, irrigation systems, roads, and technologically advanced subsidiary enterprises. On this basis, public property jointly owned by several collective farms has been formed and developed. Some scholars believe that this will be a higher form of collective farm ownership.

　　The Soviet collective farms have become diversified and economically consolidated collective farms, possessing more and more material strength, thus generating a demand for more effective use of these material forces. For example, due to the large-scale construction of production buildings and cultural and living buildings, collective farms in various places require the establishment of enterprises that produce building materials, and corresponding joint construction organizations for collective farms. Due to the rapid development of animal husbandry, there is a need to establish joint feeding stations, and so on. Practical experience shows that it is economically beneficial for collective farms to jointly organize various undertakings. For example, collective farms in Stalin Oblast, Ukrainian Republic, buying one ton of cement from their jointly built cement plant is half the price of buying it from other small cement plants. In Krasnodar Krai, construction projects undertaken by joint construction organizations not only shortened the construction period, but also reduced construction costs by 30% to 35%.

　　Now, the undertakings jointly organized by collective farms have greatly developed throughout the Soviet Union. Taking the Ukrainian Republic as an example, in 1957, 477 joint construction organizations were established throughout the republic, with 7,437 collective farms participating in these organizations. Now, the number of joint construction organizations has increased to 603, and the number of participating collective farms has reached 9,067, that is, 81% of the republic's collective farms have participated in this type of organization. According to Soviet scholars, the production enterprises and other organizations jointly established by collective farms are a higher stage of production concentration of collective farms.

### 公有化程度日益提高  物质技术基础更加雄厚  苏联集体农庄经济不断巩固发展

　　公有化程度日益提高  物质技术基础更加雄厚
    苏联集体农庄经济不断巩固发展
    新华社莫斯科20日电　苏联集体农庄的经济正在不断巩固和发展。它们的公积金和所有制公有化程度日益增加和提高，而越出了一个农庄的范围，农庄之间的经济、生产联系正在扩大。
    近几年来，集体农庄的财富和物质技术基础——公积金在数量和使用范围上有了重大的变化。1932年，全苏联集体农庄的公积金还不到五十亿卢布，到1958年就超过了一千亿卢布。今年以来，集体农庄公积金继续增长。今年乌克兰共和国集体农庄的公积金的增长速度就将大大超过近五年来的平均水平。由于公积金的增长，集体农庄就有可能以更大的规模进行经济建设。俄罗斯联邦集体农庄去年的投资达到了二百五十亿卢布以上，比1957年多一点四倍。而1955—1957年全苏集体农庄用于生产和文化生活用建筑方面的资金还只是二百九十三亿卢布。
    现在，集体农庄公积金的使用范围也已扩大，许多农庄都联合起来兴办工业、农业企业和福利设施。例如，乌克兰共和国的集体农庄还用公积金联合建设了八个休养所、五百六十五所学校；今年还要建设一千五百所学校。俄罗斯联邦共和国别尔哥罗德、梁赞州的集体农庄则联合建设一百五十所医院和产院。许多集体农庄还共同建设了或正在建设联合发电站、灌溉系统、道路，以及用现代技术装备起来的附属企业。在这个基础上，几个集体农庄所共有的公共财产就形成和发展起来了。一些学者认为，这将是集体农庄所有制的更高的形式。
    苏联的集体农庄已经变成了多种经营的和经济上巩固的集体农庄，它们拥有越来越多的物质力量，因而产生了更有效地利用这些物质力量的要求。譬如，由于大规模地兴建生产用建筑物和文化生活用建筑物，各地集体农庄就要求兴办生产建筑材料的企业，和与之相适应的集体农庄的联合建筑组织，由于急剧发展畜牧业，就要求建立联合饲养站，等等。实际经验表明，集体农庄联合举办各种事业，对集体农庄经济上是有利的。如乌克兰共和国斯大林州的集体农庄在自己联合建设的水泥厂买一吨水泥，要比在其它小型水泥厂买的便宜一半。在克拉斯诺达边疆区，由联合建筑组织负责进行的建设工程，不仅缩短了建筑期限，而且建筑造价也低了30％—35％。
    现在集体农庄联合兴办的事业在全苏联各地都有了很大的发展。以乌克兰共和国为例，1957年全共和国成立了四百七十七个联合建筑组织，有七千四百三十七个集体农庄参加了这些组织。而现在，联合建筑组织已发展到六百零三个，参加的集体农庄则达到了九千零六十七个，即共和国81％的集体农庄都参加了这种组织。根据苏联学者的意见，集体农庄联合成立的生产企业和其他组织，是集体农庄生产集中的更高阶段。
