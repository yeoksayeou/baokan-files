    Gdansk Jottings

    Looking at the Baltic Sea from the port of Gdansk, the seawater is dark green, sometimes with a very deep blue tinge. The beautiful Baltic Sea appears profound and solemn. But if you stand in the port for a while, or take a small motorboat along the port for a week, you will see the bustling life of the port. Polish and foreign ships docked at the wharf are busy loading and unloading cargo, and the long arms of the cranes are constantly swinging back and forth. Moreover, the Baltic Sea is not as tranquil as it appears at first glance. Its rushing waves excitedly beat against the shore and the docks, as if eagerly telling you about the tortuous and heroic fighting history of the city of Gdansk, once known as the "Free City of Danzig". The magnificent port and the tranquil yet passionate Baltic Sea immediately grab people's hearts, making them fall in love with this place.

    Gdansk is indeed an attractive place. This is not only because it is the largest maritime gateway in northern Poland and the center of Poland's emerging shipbuilding industry, but also because it embodies the tortuous path taken by the Polish people, their heroic anti-fascist struggle, and the rapid progress made by the people's government in the past fifteen years.

    Gdansk is one of the oldest cities in northern Poland, belonging to Poland since the twelfth century. However, its strategic position, especially its economic status as a major commercial port, brought it many disasters, and it was later occupied by Prussia for a long time, which called it "Danzig" until the First World War. But after this war, it still did not return to the embrace of its motherland. According to the Treaty of Versailles, it became the "Free City of Danzig" and was still under the control of German imperialism. In 1945, the armies of the Polish and Soviet people fought side by side to crush the Hitler fascist army and liberate this ancient seaport. Gdansk was then stripped of the humiliating name of "Free City" and truly became a free city of People's Poland.

    When we arrived in Gdansk, we first went to the heroic Westerplatte area. This place became world-famous in the early days of the Second World War due to the heroic spirit of the Polish people in resisting the fascist invasion. During the period of the "Free City of Danzig", Poland's rights in this city were limited to customs, post office, and this area called Westerplatte. This area is a narrow peninsula facing the Baltic Sea on two sides and the port canal on one side. At dawn on September 1, 1939, when the Hitler fascist army launched a full-scale attack on Poland, this peninsula area under its eyelashes bore the brunt. The Hitler army bombarded from warships and from the city with heavy artillery, and dozens of planes bombed in turn. However, the Polish defending soldiers and railway workers on the peninsula, numbering only two hundred or so, carried out an extremely heroic defense, holding out for seven days and nights under a rain of shells. According to Polish friends, the first shot of the Hitler fascist invasion of Poland was fired here. At the same time, the first victim of the Polish people's heroic resistance against the German fascist aggression was Naisalak, the stationmaster of the Westerplatte narrow-gauge railway station. Therefore, the Polish people have preserved the remains of the fierce battle on the peninsula, considering it the most memorable area.

    Westerplatte used to be covered with dense forests and was a beautiful place, but now it looks almost barren. Only crooked branches remain on a few very thick old trees. The remains of the two bunkers are well preserved, and the traces of the narrow-gauge railway can also be seen. Beside the grave of the peninsula defenders, two tall and straight oak trees seem to symbolize the heroes' perseverance. The sound of the sea waves here is passionate and resounding, like a hymn played for them.

    Not far from the defenders' tomb, a powerful excavator is working, breaking the surrounding silence. The heroic Westerplatte is also contributing to the construction cause of the Polish people. The expansion project of the port of Gdansk will be extended here.

    Speaking of the port, one immediately thinks of the emerging shipbuilding industry here in the era of the people's government. This is a major symbol of Gdansk's rapid progress in the past fifteen years.

    Everyone knows that before the Polish people seized power, there was only a small merchant fleet, almost no shipbuilding industry, and the only seaport was the small port of Gdynia, more than 20 kilometers away from Gdansk. After liberation, Poland recovered a large area of ​​land, the coastline became longer, and not only were huge seaports built, but also a shipbuilding industry arose in Gdansk and Szczecin on the basis of the severely damaged ship repair yards and small shipyards. Now, Poland can not only manufacture fishing boats, but also build giant ships of more than 10,000 tons. In September of this year, Polish shipbuilding workers warmly celebrated the happy event of the shipbuilding industry producing one million tons of ships, and put forward the bold statement of building one million tons of ships in the next four years. This year, the tonnage of ocean-going vessels manufactured in Poland reached 200,000 tons, surpassing countries with a long shipbuilding history such as Finland, ranking eleventh in the world, and will reach 260,000 tons next year. Polish sea vessels now travel to ports in forty countries.

    The Gdansk Shipyard is the largest of the three major shipyards in Gdansk, Gdynia and Szczecin in Poland. From the small bridge next to the "Green Gate", the ancient imperial palace in the city center, board a motorboat and proceed along the tributary of the Vistula River estuary. After walking not far, turn right and you can see the tall cranes and docks lining the right bank. This is the Gdansk Shipyard. This factory was just a ship repair yard before the war. Now it can build 18,000-ton ships, and it is also preparing to build 35,000-ton large oil tankers. At the end of September this year, the 10,000-ton ship newly built and launched by this factory was named "Beijing" to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country.

    Gdansk and Gdynia, which is to its northwest, have formed a joint port, or in other words, have united into one city - Greater Gdansk. Gdynia was Poland's only maritime gateway before the war. Today, its port stands with merchant ships and warships, majestic in its momentum. Ships of the Sino-Polish Maritime Transport Company, which travel between Poland and our country, often dock here. Gdynia is advancing side by side with Gdansk. During Poland's second five-year plan (1961-1965), a new large shipyard capable of manufacturing 65,000-ton ships will be established here.

    In Gdansk, besides the Baltic Sea, the port and the shipyard, the most attractive is its ancient city area. Entering through the Vizinna City Gate built in the sixteenth century, you will find Long Street and Long Market. This area concentrates the beautiful houses of the Renaissance period with their quaint charm. At the end of Long Street is the Municipal Building, built in the seventeenth century, which is 82 meters high. Further ahead is Long Market. However, although the houses on Long Street and Long Market are old Renaissance style, it is not quite accurate to call them old. Because these houses were basically rebuilt after the war. In 1945, before the Hitler army retreated, it stubbornly resisted and fought fiercely, destroying 92% of this street, leaving only two complete houses. Part of the Municipal Building was also destroyed. After the war, when the people of Gdansk rebuilt their homes, they hoped to preserve the city's famous medieval architectural art and restore Long Market to its original attractive ancient beauty. However, these old houses are relatively narrow, each house is only three or two rooms wide, and they cannot meet the needs of modern people's careers. What should we do? Finally, they decided to restore the original appearance of Long Market Street, but only in external form, while the interior of the houses is several buildings linked together, spacious and equipped with modern facilities. We visited the District People's Congress on this street. The interior is spacious and comfortable, but from the outside, it looks like six houses with different colors and decorations.

    Of course, the post-war restoration of Gdansk's city appearance is not limited to Long Market Street. The Municipal Building has also been restored. And on the road from Gdansk to Gdynia, all the buildings on the right side of Victory Bodhi Tree-lined Avenue, which is one and a half kilometers long, were newly built after the war.

    In the past fifteen years, Gdansk has gone from a port that was destroyed and paralyzed to one of the largest ports in Europe, from a small ship repair shop to the largest and most prestigious shipyard in Europe, from rubble and ruins to Long Market and Victory Boulevard, attracting millions of tourists. Everywhere you can see the glorious achievements of the Polish people in building a socialist motherland with their hardworking hands.

    革但斯克散记
    从革但斯克港口看波罗的海，海水是墨绿色的，有时还泛出很深的蓝色。美丽的波罗的海显得深沉、肃穆。但是当你在港口站上一会儿，或是乘小汽艇沿港口驶一周，就会看到港口的沸腾的生活。码头上停泊着的波兰的和外国的船只忙着装卸货物，起重机的长臂不停地来回摆动。而且波罗的海也不是乍看起来的那么宁静。它那奔腾的浪花激动地拍打着岸边、码头，像是急切地向你叙述这一度被称为“但泽自由市”的革但斯克城的曲折的、英勇战斗的经历。壮丽的港口和恬静而又热情的波罗的海一下子就抓住了人们的心，使人不由得立刻爱上这个地方。
    革但斯克确实是个吸引人的地方。这不仅因为它是波兰北方海上最大的门户，是人民波兰新兴的造船业中心，而且从它身上可以看到波兰人民走过的曲折的道路、英勇的反法西斯斗争和人民政权十五年来的突飞猛进。
    革但斯克是波兰北部古老的城市之一，从十二世纪就属波兰。但是它的战略地位，特别是大商港的经济地位，给它带来了不少灾难，后来则长期被普鲁士占领，普鲁士把它叫作“但泽”，直到第一次世界大战。可是这次大战后它依然没有回到祖国的怀抱，根据凡尔赛条约成为了“但泽自由市”，还是在德国帝国主义控制之下。1945年，波兰和苏联两国人民的军队并肩粉碎了希特勒法西斯的军队，解放了这个古老的海港。革但斯克从此才去掉了所谓“自由市”的屈辱的名称，真正成了人民波兰的自由城市。
    来到革但斯克，我们首先到英雄的维斯特普拉台地区去。这个地方由于波兰人民抗击法西斯进攻的英雄气概，在第二次世界大战爆发的最初几天曾名闻世界。在“但泽自由市”的时期，波兰在这个城市的权利只有海关、邮局和这个名叫维斯特普拉台的地区。这个地区两面临波罗的海，一面临港口运河，是个狭长的半岛。1939年9月1日拂晓，希特勒法西斯军队向波兰全线进攻时，这个在它睫毛下的半岛地区，首当其冲。希特勒军队当时从军舰上、从城市用重炮轰击，几十架飞机轮番轰炸。但是半岛上波兰的守卫战士和铁路职工，人数不过二百多名，进行了英勇无比的保卫战，在炮弹如雨的情况下坚守了七昼夜。据波兰朋友说，希特勒法西斯进攻波兰全国的第一枪是在这儿打响的，同时，波兰人民英勇反抗德国法西斯侵略的第一个牺牲者，就是维斯特普拉台窄轨铁路小车站的站长那依萨拉克。因此，波兰人民保留着半岛上激战的遗迹，认为它是最值得纪念的地区。
    维斯特普拉台原来披着茂密的树林，是个美丽的地方，如今看起来几乎是光秃秃的了。几棵很粗的老树只留下了歪扭的枝杈。两个地堡的遗迹还很好地保存着，也看得见那窄轨小铁路的痕迹。半岛保卫者的墓旁，两棵高大挺直的橡树，好似英雄们坚忍不拔的精神的象征。这儿海浪声激昂高亢，像是为他们奏的颂歌。
    距保卫者的墓不远，一架强大的挖土机在工作，冲破了四周的寂静。英雄的维斯特普拉台也要为波兰人民的建设事业贡献一份力量。革但斯克港口的扩建工程将扩展到这里。
    谈到港口，就立刻使人想起在人民政权时代这里新兴的造船工业。这是革但斯克十五年来阔步前进的一个主要标志。
    谁都知道，波兰在人民掌握政权以前，只有一支不大的商船队，几乎没有造船工业，海港也只有距革但斯克二十多公里的小海港格但尼亚。解放后，波兰收复了大片国土，海岸线长了，不仅建起了巨大的海港，而且在革但斯克和什切青那遭到严重破坏的船只修理厂和小造船厂的基础上，兴起了造船工业。现在，波兰不但能制造捕鱼汽艇，而且能制造万吨以上的巨轮了。今年9月，波兰造船工人曾经热烈地庆祝了造船业生产的船只满一百万吨的喜事，并提出今后四年内要建造一百万吨轮船的豪语。今年，波兰制造的远洋轮船的吨位达二十万吨，已经超过了具有悠久造船历史的芬兰等国，占世界第十一位，明年就要达到二十六万吨。波兰的海船现在往来于四十个国家的港口。
    革但斯克造船厂是波兰在革但斯克、格但尼亚和什切青那的三大造船厂中最大的一个。从市中心古老的帝王行宫“绿门”旁边的小桥处登上汽艇，沿着维斯杜拉河入海处的支流前行，走不多远向右一转，就看得见右岸上高大的起重机和船坞林立，这就是革但斯克造船厂了。这个厂战前只不过是个船只修理厂，现在已经能造一万八千吨的轮船，而且还准备建造三万五千吨的大油轮呢。今年9月底，这个厂新造成下水的万吨轮船，为了庆祝我国建国十周年，被命名为“北京”号。
    革但斯克同在它西北的格但尼亚已经组成一个联合港了，或者说，已经联成为一个城市——大革但斯克了。格但尼亚在战前是波兰唯一的海上门户，如今它的港口屹立着商船和军舰，气势雄伟，往来于波兰和我国之间的中波海运公司的船只就经常停泊在这里。格但尼亚正在同革但斯克并驾齐驱地前进着，在波兰第二个五年计划期间（1961—1965年），这儿将要建立一个新的能制造六万五千吨轮船的大造船厂。
    在革但斯克，除了波罗的海、港口和造船厂外，最吸引人的就是它那古老的市区。从十六世纪建的维任纳城门进去，便是长街和长市场。这儿集中了文艺复兴时期古色古香的优美的房屋。长街尽头是十七世纪建起的高达八十二米的市政大厦，再向前走就是长市场了。不过，长街和长市场上的房子虽然是古老的文艺复兴式的，但说它古老并不恰当。因为这些房子基本上是战后新建的。1945年希特勒军队撤退前曾经顽抗激战，把这条街破坏了92％，只剩下了两所完整的房子。市政大厦也破坏了一部分。战后当革但斯克人民重建自己的家园时，人们希望保存这个城市颇负盛名的中世纪的建筑艺术，使长市场恢复它本来那诱人的古代美。可是这些古老的房子比较狭窄，每幢房子不过三两间宽，又不能满足现代人民事业的需要。怎么办呢？最后他们决定恢复长市场街的本来面目，但只是外部形式上是这样的，而房子内部却是几幢联在一起、宽敞的具有现代化设备。我们曾到这条街上区人民代表会去参观，里边宽敞舒适，但从外表看来，却是色彩不同、装饰花样各异的六幢房子。
    当然，革但斯克市容战后的修复工作不仅长市场街而已。市政大厦也修复了。而从革但斯克前往格但尼亚的路上，长达一公里半的胜利菩提树林荫大道，右面所有的楼房都是战后新建的。
    十五年来，革但斯克从被破坏得已经瘫痪了的港口到侪身于欧洲最大的港口之列，从小小的船只修理所到波兰最大而且在全欧享有盛名的造船厂，从瓦砾废墟到吸引着千万游人的长市场和胜利林荫路，处处都看得出波兰人民用勤劳的双手建设社会主义祖国的光辉成就。
