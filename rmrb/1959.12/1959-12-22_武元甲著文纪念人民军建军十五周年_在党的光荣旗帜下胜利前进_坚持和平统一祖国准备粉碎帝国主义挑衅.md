Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Electric Dispatch: The latest issue of the Vietnamese Labor Party's political theory journal "Study Magazine" published an article by General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, entitled "The People's Army's Fifteen Years of Combat and Growth Under the Party's Glorious Banner," commemorating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army (December 22).

The article pointed out that the Vietnamese People's Army is a true people's army under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, and that "the Party's leadership, the Party's correct political line and military line are the decisive factors for the victory of the Vietnamese people." The article said, "The Party's military line took shape in 1940-1945 and was fully and creatively developed during the war of resistance to save the country. It is the concrete application of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism in our country's revolutionary struggle, especially armed struggle. It is the line of conducting people's war and building a people's army under the leadership of the Party."

The article said that the Vietnamese people's armed struggle and the heroic long-term resistance against French and American imperialism are people's wars, and therefore they have achieved great victories.

The article pointed out that the Party's leadership is the decisive factor for the Vietnamese people's armed struggle and the Vietnamese People's Army to achieve victory in combat. In the process of the People's Army's growth, the system of Party leadership, the political commissar system, and the political work system have gradually taken shape and developed. The People's Army pays special attention to the unity of commanders and fighters and the unity between the army and the people, fully implements internal democracy, and has strict discipline built on a conscious basis.

The article said that the world situation is tending towards relaxation, but imperialism still exists, and they will inevitably continue to expand their armies and prepare for war. In Vietnam, the US imperialists and their running dog Ngo Dinh Diem regime are ravaging half of Vietnam, persecuting the South Vietnamese people, and stepping up their arms expansion and war preparations. Recently, US imperialism has intensified its intervention in Laos, threatening the security of Vietnam. Therefore, ideological paralysis and loss of vigilance are dangerous mistakes.

The article said that our policy is to adhere to peace, consolidate peace, and strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. But we are always ready to crush the provocative conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors.

　　武元甲著文纪念人民军建军十五周年
    在党的光荣旗帜下胜利前进
    坚持和平统一祖国准备粉碎帝国主义挑衅
    新华社河内电　最近一期的越南劳动党政治理论刊物“学习杂志”刊登了越南人民军总司令武元甲大将为纪念越南人民军建军十五周年（12月22日）发表的题为“在党的光荣旗帜下，人民军十五年来的战斗和成长”的文章。
    文章指出，越南人民军是越南劳动党领导下的真正的人民军队，“党的领导，党的正确的政治路线和军事路线是越南人民取得胜利的决定因素”。文章说，“党的军事路线在1940—1945年形成，并在抗战救国时期获得充分和创造性的发展。它是马克思列宁主义普遍真理在我国的革命斗争、特别是武装斗争中的具体运用。它是在党的领导下进行人民战争和建设人民军队的路线”。
    文章说，越南人民的武装斗争和英勇地反对法、美帝国主义的长期抗战是人民战争，因此它取得了巨大的胜利。
    文章指出，党的领导是越南人民的武装斗争和越南人民军在战斗中取得胜利的决定因素。在人民军成长的过程中，关于党的领导的制度、政委制和政治工作制度逐步形成和发展。人民军特别重视指挥员和战斗员的团结一致和军民之间的团结，充分实行内部民主，并具有建立在自觉基础上的严明的纪律。
    文章说，世界局势正在趋向缓和，可是帝国主义还存在，它们必然继续扩军备战。在越南，美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳当局正在蹂躏越南半壁河山，迫害南越人民，加紧扩军备战。最近，美帝国主义又加紧干涉老挝，威胁越南的安全。所以思想麻痹、失去警惕性的倾向是危险的错误。
    文章说，我们的政策是坚持和平、巩固和平、为和平统一祖国而奋斗。可是我们时刻准备粉碎帝国主义侵略者的挑衅阴谋。
