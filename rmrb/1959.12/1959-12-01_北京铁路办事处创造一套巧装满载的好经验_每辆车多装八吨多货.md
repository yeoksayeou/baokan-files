    Beijing Railway Office Creates a Set of Good Experiences in Clever Loading to Achieve Full Capacity
    Each Car Loads More Than Eight Tons of Goods

    (Our dispatch) Beijing Railway Office employees have created a complete set of experiences for improving the static load capacity (the load weight of each freight car). Over the past month, the average load weight of each freight car has increased from 39.9 tons to 48 tons, reaching the advanced national level.
  The Beijing Railway Office is one of the three offices under the Beijing Railway Bureau. The entire office has ninety-two freight stations, distributed in Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, and other places. Before the office vigorously increased the static load capacity of freight cars, the contradiction between transportation volume and carrying capacity was very sharp. In the office's freight section, at least fifty consigning units waited every day to request transportation arrangements. Many stations also had a large backlog of materials that could not be shipped out.
    In late October, the Party Committee of the Beijing Railway Office decided to reverse this passive situation. After analysis and research, it was found that the potential of the static load capacity of freight cars was very large. The load weight of each freight car was only 91% of the marked load weight of the freight car. On average, loading eleven freight cars' worth of goods was equivalent to wasting one freight car. They calculated a detailed account. If each freight car could load three more tons of goods, a large number of backloged goods could be shipped out in a timely manner. Subsequently, the Party Committee convened a mass meeting, mobilizing all employees to launch a clever loading and full capacity movement to load three more tons of goods per freight car.
    Since the mass movement to improve the static load capacity of freight cars was launched, employees have put forward a total of more than two thousand six hundred rationalization proposals for clever loading and full capacity. Each freight car has loaded an average of 8.1 tons more goods, greatly exceeding the targets set by the Party Committee. Due to the improvement of the static load capacity level, the first two weeks of November transported more than 245,000 tons of goods than the same period in October, equivalent to the one-time carrying capacity of more than 6,000 freight cars in the past.
    The clever loading methods created by the employees can be summarized into ten characters: "dismantle, modify, match, nest, stack, carry, piece, share, combine, climb." Dismantle: Under the condition of ensuring quality, disassemble and assemble some large machinery with simple assembly; Modify: Improve the packaging specifications of goods to adapt to the volume of different vehicles; Match: Match light goods and heavy goods for loading; Nest: Nest large goods and small goods together; Stack: Stack light goods high and reinforce them with strapping; Carry: Use empty freight cars going in the same direction to carry goods; Piece: Consolidate scattered goods destined for the same location that are insufficient to fill a freight car for loading; Share: In the past, when goods exceeded the length of each freight car, it was necessary to add a flatcar as a "idler car". Now, it is changed to two freight cars sharing one "idler car"; Combine: According to different goods, use boxcars, open cars, and flatcars for loading respectively to achieve rational use of vehicles; Climb: When transporting cars, change from flat loading to climbing loading. For example, the East Suburb Station recently, when transporting two hundred and fifty 7.1-meter-long "hay rakes," according to the previous method of loading, each freight car could only load two units. This time, they cooperated with the technical personnel of the cargo owner—the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory—to disassemble the axles, wheels, and other large parts of the "hay rakes" and stack them in layers on the car. As a result, each freight car loaded eleven units, and the average load weight increased by more than four times. Through clever loading and full capacity, various stations can timely transport the frequently backloged scattered goods over a long period without increasing the number of vehicles. The Guang'anmen Station, where scattered goods account for an average of 80% of the freight volume, had more than 5,000 tons of scattered goods regularly backlogged at the station and in warehouses a month ago. Since the employees adopted more than twenty methods of cleverly loading scattered goods, the average load volume of each freight car has increased by half. Now, this station has basically achieved "loading goods on the same day they arrive, and ensuring no backlog every day" for scattered goods.
    In the process of vigorously improving the static load capacity of freight cars, the Beijing Office has always adhered to a vigorous mass movement and has closely grasped four principles: 1. Do not extend the stop time at the station; 2. Do not exceed the vehicle's specified load weight to ensure driving safety; 3. Ensure that the goods are not damaged; 4. Do not create unloading problems for neighboring stations for the convenience of loading at this station. To solve the contradiction between loading more goods and not prolonging the stop time at the station, many stations have created a large number of loading tools to improve loading efficiency. The average stop time of all vehicles in the office has been shortened by 0.2 hours compared to before the increase in static load capacity.

    北京铁路办事处创造一套巧装满载的好经验
    每辆车多装八吨多货
    本报讯　北京铁路办事处职工创造了一套完整的提高货车静载重（每辆货车的载重量）的经验，一个月来，每辆货车的载重量平均从三十九点九吨提高到四十八吨，达到全国先进水平。
  北京铁路办事处是北京铁路局所属的三个办事处中的一个。全处共有九十二个货运车站，分布在北京、张家口、保定等地。这个处在大力提高货车静载重以前，运输量和运载能力的矛盾很尖锐。在办事处的货运科里，每天至少有五十多个托运单位等着要求安排运输任务。许多车站又积压了大量物资运不出去。
    10月下旬，北京铁路办事处党委会决心扭转这种被动局面，经过分析研究后，发现货车静载重的潜力很大，每辆货车皮的载重量只达货车标记载重的91％，平均每装十一辆货车的货，等于浪费一辆货车。他们算了一笔细账，如果每辆货车能够多装三吨货物，就能把大量积压的货物及时运出去。接着，党委会就召开群众大会，发动全体职工开展每辆货车多装三吨货物的巧装满载运动。
    群众性的提高货车静载重运动开展以来，职工们总共提出了二千六百多项巧装满载的合理化建议，每辆货车平均多装了八点一吨货物，大大突破了党委提出的指标。由于静载重水平的提高，11月头两旬比10月份同期多运了二十四万五千多吨货物，等于过去六千多辆货车一次的运量。
    职工们创造的巧装满载方法，归纳起来有“拆、改、配、套、码、捎、凑、共、合、爬”十个字。拆，在保证质量条件下，将一些装配较简单的大型机械分解拆装；改，改善货物包装规格，适应不同车辆的容积；配，轻货物和重货物配装；套，大货物和小货物套装；码，把轻货物堆砌码高，绑扎加固；捎，利用没装满的顺路货车捎货；凑，把发往同一地点不足一辆货车的零散货物，拼凑装车；共，过去货物超过每辆货车的长度时，必须加挂一个平板车作为“游车”，现在，改为两辆货车共用一个“游车”；合，根据不同货物，分别使用篷车、敞车、平板车装载，做到合理用车；爬，载运汽车时由平装改为爬装。例如，东郊车站最近在装运二百五十台七点一米长的“集草车”时，按以往方法装车，每辆货车只能装载两台，这次他们和货主——北京农业机械厂的技术人员合作，把“集草车”的车轴、车轮等大部件拆下来，分层迭装在车上。结果每辆货车装运了十一台，载重量平均提高四倍多。各个车站通过巧装满载，在不增加车辆的情况下，长期来经常积压的零散货物都能及时运送出去。零散货物平均占货运量80％的广安门车站，一个月以前，在车站和仓库内积压待运的零散货物经常达五千多吨。自从职工们采取了二十多种巧装零散货物的方法以后，每辆货车的载货量平均提高了一半。现在，这个车站对零散货物基本上已经做到“当天货当天装，天天做到不积压”。
    北京办事处在大力提高货车静载重过程中，始终贯穿着轰轰烈烈的群众运动，并且紧紧地掌握了四条原则：一、不能延长停站时间；二、不能超过车辆规定的载重量，确保行车安全；三、保证货物不受损伤；四、不能为本站装车方便，而造成邻站卸车麻烦。为了解决多装货物和不延长停站时间的矛盾，许多车站创造了大批装车工具，提高装车效率。全处车辆平均停站时间比提高静载重前，反而缩短了零点二小时。
