Fly, Steel Eagle
By our correspondent stationed in Anshan

Anshan Iron and Steel, the steel eagle of the motherland, is spreading its wings vigorously, soaring towards new production peaks in the coming year on the height it has already reached this year.

The Aspiration to Advance Courageously

This year, especially after August, the steel production of Anshan Iron and Steel has been rising month by month, soaring upwards. Now, the heroes of Anshan Iron and Steel have taken advantage of the victory and are beating the drums of war for continued leaps forward next year. Recently, we visited Anshan Iron and Steel and felt a kind of courage to advance and constantly leap forward shining everywhere.

The furnace chiefs of the nationally famous Red Flag Open Hearth Furnace – Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 Open Hearth Furnace, after completing the annual plan ahead of schedule, held a meeting overnight to study how to stride into 1960. Yang Guofa, the furnace chief of Shift C, had just finished his shift and had not had time to take off his work clothes before rushing to participate in the meeting. He proposed to increase production by another 10,000 tons of steel, turning December into the highest level of the year, setting a more advanced example for continued leaps forward next year. All four shift chiefs had this requirement. Everyone contributed ideas and suggestions, drafting measures to create the highest monthly production level. The meeting lasted from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. As soon as the meeting ended, they plunged into the new battle.

Among the blast furnaces, in front of and behind the open hearth furnaces, and beside the rolling mills, the aspiration for continued leaps forward is being transformed into the practical actions of steel heroes.

Xu Zhenye, the pacesetter for maintaining the tapping hole of Blast Furnace No. 9 and the leader of the front-of-furnace team of Shift A, picked out a drill bit with the largest diameter, aimed at the angle and inserted it into the tapping hole, swinging the sledgehammer several times in a row. Pulling out the drill bit and jumping back, it was truly as quick as lightning, and dazzling molten iron rushed towards the molten iron ladle. After tapping the iron, the depth of the tapping hole was measured and maintained above 1.7 meters, a smile of victory appearing on his face. It turned out that as soon as December began, the production of Blast Furnace No. 9 encountered difficulties: because the iron production suddenly increased, the tapping hole was eroded very shallow, generally only about 1.3 meters. When tapping the iron, it was necessary to reduce the air supply, and each reduction in air would reduce the production of several tons of iron. After repeated research, Xu Zhenye successfully experimented with making large holes when tapping iron, allowing the molten iron to flow quickly and reducing the time the molten iron eroded the tapping hole, overcoming the difficulty of shallow tapping holes. The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 Blast Furnace, the champion of large blast furnaces in the country, continuously broke through four barriers, including shallow tapping holes and low hot air temperature, increasing the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace from 2.203 in the highest month of this year to 2.358 in the first 20 days of December, realizing the aspiration of setting a higher standard for continued leaps forward next year.

The Magic Weapon for Continuous Leaps Forward

In front of the "Open Hearth King's" platform, among the steelworkers who were operating intensely, we found Secretary Liu of the Party Committee of the Third Steelmaking Plant. We saw him swinging a shovel for a while, rushing towards the long tongues of flame, skillfully blocking the furnace door, and then talking intimately with the workers about something... In order to organize the continued leaps forward next year, he is planting "experimental fields" here, helping the workers summarize and learn various advanced experiences in increasing steel production through "more charging and faster smelting."

As early as May of this year, the Party Committee of this plant used such leadership methods to discover and cultivate the experience of the technical performance competition that caused a sensation throughout the country. Over the past few months, through the technical performance competition, all the workers of this steelmaking plant have innovated thousands of production technologies, rapidly increasing the daily steel production level from about 2,700 tons in April to more than 4,100 tons since December.

As soon as December arrived, the Party Committee of the Third Steelmaking Plant led the mass movement of technical performance competitions to a new climax. Two secretaries and three plant directors led the cadres of the entire plant to work in three shifts, helping the workers conduct a "grand review and grand summary" of the experiences that had already emerged, compiling a total of 514 sets of advanced experiences to ensure that production next year would continue to leap forward even better.

This leadership method of going deep among the masses, summarizing the experience of the masses, and guiding the mass movement to advance continuously has become the magic weapon for leading cadres at all levels of Anshan Iron and Steel to organize continuous leaps forward in production.

The Source of Infinite Potential

Cui Yushen, the general furnace chief of Open Hearth Furnace No. 6, peered at the boiling situation of the molten steel through blue protective glasses, then turned around and came to the back of the open hearth furnace, waved to the crane operator, and a ladle of molten iron scurried into the open hearth furnace like a golden dragon. People watching the technical performance couldn't help but ask: "How much is charged in this furnace?" Cui Yushen looked at the rolling molten steel in the furnace and replied, "About 300 tons!" The person who asked couldn't help but stick out his tongue. When the furnace was tapped and calculated, it produced 290 tons of steel, and because the molten steel ladle couldn't hold it all, there were still ten tons or so left in the furnace. Not only was 20 tons more steel produced than planned, but the steelmaking time was also shortened by more than an hour, creating a new record of "more charging and faster smelting."

When we congratulated him, he humbly told us: "This is the result of learning the advanced experience of Open Hearth Furnace No. 4." Open Hearth Furnace No. 6 and Open Hearth Furnace No. 4 have always been competitors. In terms of conditions, the two furnaces are about the same, but in the competition in the first nine months of this year, Open Hearth Furnace No. 4 has always been behind Open Hearth Furnace No. 6. In October, the workers of Open Hearth Furnace No. 4 successfully experimented with an experience of "pouring molten iron," increasing the charge of the open hearth furnace from the original 229 tons to 256 tons, suddenly catching up with Open Hearth Furnace No. 6. As soon as the experience of Open Hearth Furnace No. 4 appeared, the workers of Open Hearth Furnace No. 6 decided to learn humbly, striving to use the experience of Open Hearth Furnace No. 4 to surpass Open Hearth Furnace No. 4 again. Wu Youfa, the furnace chief of Shift C, took the lead in experimenting, but he spilled slag and iron all over the place. General furnace chief Cui Yushen was recuperating at home at the time. When he heard that learning advanced experience had not been successful and slag and iron had been spilled all over the place, he got out of bed and ran to the factory in one breath. Later, he personally experimented with three furnaces and found the reason for the slag and iron spills, and the advanced experience was successfully learned. The production in November took a big step forward and really caught up with Open Hearth Furnace No. 4. Recently, the experience of Open Hearth Furnace No. 4 has blossomed and borne fruit in all the open hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel. This will play a significant role in increasing production next year. This atmosphere of humbly learning advanced experience and continuously innovating production technology has excavated huge potential for Anshan Iron and Steel's continued leaps forward next year.

Front and Rear United as One

In Anshan Iron and Steel's raw material base – the Dagushan Iron Mine, the ore dressing workers launched a battle in November to improve the quality and output of iron concentrate powder.

Technician Liu Jinsheng stayed by the magnetic separator every day, studying how to make the magnetic separator fully exert its separation effect. In the past, the separation capacity of the magnetic separator was low, affecting the output and quality of iron concentrate powder from being improved. Old worker Fu Shiye and Liu Jinsheng experimented with reducing the concentration of the mineral liquid, increasing the quality of the iron concentrate powder from less than 62.8% to more than 63%. Another old worker, Zhao Tingyu, came up with a method of increasing the current on this basis, sucking back a lot of the iron powder that had run away, which not only improved the quality but also increased the output. The statistics chart of the production section of the Dagushan Iron Mine tells people: Since entering December, the iron content of the iron concentrate powder has increased from 62.8% in October to about 64%, and the output of iron concentrate powder has also steadily broken through the 10,000-ton mark. Blast furnaces can eat more of this fine grain next year.

A battle of transporting more and faster and rushing to transport "grain and grass" is being carried out enthusiastically in Anshan Iron and Steel's transportation department. More than 200 factory directors, station masters, and section chiefs who used to be drivers, old generals, are taking the field again, returning to their old profession, to perform transporting more and faster. Under the leadership of the old generals, the transportation workers transport a large amount of ore powder from the raw material base to the sintering plant every day. In mid-December, more than 100,000 tons more were transported than in the first ten days of the month, preparing enough "grain and grass" for a good start next year.

Looking at the heroic actions of the steel heroes, we shouted with full of passion: Spread your wings and fly high, Anshan Iron and Steel, you steel eagle!

　　飞吧，钢铁的雄鹰
　　本报驻鞍山记者
    鞍钢，祖国的钢铁雄鹰，正在今年已经达到的高度上，展翅雄劲地冲向明年生产的新高峰。
    勇往直前的壮志
    今年，特别是8月以后，鞍钢的钢铁生产，一个月比一个月高，一直是扶摇直上。现在，鞍钢的各路英雄已经乘胜擂响了明年继续跃进的战鼓。最近，我们在鞍钢访问，到处都感到一种勇往直前、不断跃进的思想在闪烁发光。
    全国著名的红旗平炉——鞍钢十号平炉的炉长们，在提前完成全年计划以后，就连夜开会，研究如何大步跨进1960年。丙班炉长杨国发刚下班，还没有来得及脱工作服，就跑来参加这个会。他提议再增产一万吨钢，把今年12月份变成全年的最高水平，为明年继续跃进树立更先进的榜样。四个班的炉长都有这种要求。大家便你献一计，我献一策，拟好了创造最高月产水平的措施。会议从晚上九点钟一直开到夜里十一点。刚刚散会，他们就紧张地投入了新的战斗。
    在高炉群中，在平炉前后，在轧钢机旁，继续跃进的壮志正在变成钢铁英雄们的实际行动。
    九号高炉维护出铁口的标兵、甲班炉前工组长徐振业，挑出一根直径最大的钎子，量准角度插进出铁口里去，抡起大锤一连就是几锤，拔出钎子纵身一跳，真是说时迟那时快，只见耀眼的铁水急湍地向铁水罐流去。出完铁一量出铁口，深度保持在一米七以上，他的脸上现出了一丝胜利的微笑。原来，刚一进入12月，九号高炉的生产就碰到了困难：因为铁的产量突然增加，出铁口被冲刷的很浅，一般只有一米三左右，出铁时要减少送风量，而减一次风就要少产几吨铁。徐振业经过多次研究，试验成功出铁时打大眼，让铁水快流，减少铁水冲刷出铁口的时间，攻克了出铁口浅这一关。全国大型高炉冠军——鞍钢九号高炉的职工，就这样连续闯过出铁口浅、热风温度低等四道关口，使高炉利用系数从今年最高月份的二点二零三，提高到12月头二十天的二点三五八，实现了为明年继续跃进树立更高标准的壮志。
    不断跃进的法宝
    在“平炉王”的炉台前，在紧张操作的炼钢工人当中，我们找到了第三炼钢厂党委刘书记。只见他一会儿抡起铁锹，冲向长长的火舌，在熟练地堵炉门，一会儿又同工人亲切地谈论着什么……。为了组织明年的继续跃进，他正在这里种“试验田”，帮助工人总结学习各种“多装、快炼”增产钢的先进经验。
    早在今年5月间，这个厂的党委就运用这样的领导方法，发现和培植了轰动全国的技术表演赛经验。几个月来，通过技术表演赛，这个炼钢厂的全体工人革新了成千上万项生产技术，使钢的日产水平从4月份的二千七百吨左右，迅速地提高到12月以来的四千一百吨以上。
    刚一跨进12月，第三炼钢厂党委便又把技术表演赛的群众运动引向了一个新高潮。两个书记、三个厂长，率领全厂干部分三班跟班劳动，帮助工人对已经出现的经验进行“大检阅、大总结”，共配成五百一十四套先进经验，保证明年的生产更好地继续跃进。
    这种深入群众、总结群众经验、引导群众运动不断前进的领导方法，已经成为鞍钢各级领导干部组织生产不断跃进的法宝了。
    无穷潜力的源泉
    六号平炉总炉长崔玉深，透过蓝色的保护眼镜，注视了一会钢水的沸腾情况，然后转身来到平炉后面，向吊车司机一招手，一罐铁水便像金龙一般窜进平炉里去。看技术表演的人，都不住地问：“这一炉装多少？”崔玉深看一看炉里翻滚的钢水，回答说：“大概有三百吨吧！”问的人不禁吐一下舌头。等到出完炉一计算，一炉产钢二百九十吨，因为钢水罐装不下，炉里还剩了十来吨，不仅比计划多产了二十吨钢，炼钢时间还缩短了一个多小时，创造了“多装快炼”的新纪录。
    当我们向他祝贺的时候，他谦虚地告诉我们：“这是学习四号平炉先进经验的结果”。六号平炉和四号平炉，一直是竞赛对手，论条件，两座炉差不多少，可是在今年头九个月的竞赛里，四号平炉一直落在六号平炉的后面。10月份，四号平炉工人试验成功了一项“兑铁水”的经验，把平炉的装入量，从原来的二百二十九吨提高到二百五十六吨，一下子赶过了六号平炉。四号平炉的经验一出现，六号平炉的工人就决定虚心学习，争取用四号平炉的经验再超过四号平炉。丙班炉长吴有发带头试验，但是跑了满地渣子和铁。总炉长崔玉深，当时正在家里养病，听说学习先进经验没学好，跑了满地渣子和铁，便从炕上爬起来，一口气跑到厂里来。后来，他亲手试验了三炉，找出了跑渣跑铁的原因，先进经验学习成功了。11月份的生产向前大大跃进了一步，真的赶过了四号平炉。最近，四号平炉的经验已经在鞍钢的所有平炉上开花结果。这对明年增产将起不小作用。这种虚心学习先进经验，不断地革新生产技术的风气，已经为鞍钢明年的继续跃进挖掘出巨大的潜力。
    前方后方一条心
    在鞍钢的原料基地——大孤山铁矿里，选矿工人在11月间就展开了提高精矿粉质量和产量的战斗。
    技术员刘金声每天守在磁选机旁，研究怎样让磁选机充分发挥选别作用。过去磁选机选别能力低，影响精矿粉的产量和质量不能提高。老工人富世业和刘金声试验降低矿液浓度，使精矿粉的质量从原来不到62.8％提高到63％以上。另一个老工人赵庭玉又在这一基础上，想出了一个加大电流的办法，把跑掉的铁粉吸回来很多，不但提高了质量，又提高了产量。大孤山铁矿生产科的统计图表告诉人们：进入12月以来，精矿粉的含铁成分，已经从10月的62.8％提高到64％左右，精矿粉的产量也稳定地突破了万吨大关。明年高炉可以更多地吃这种细粮了。
    一个多拉快跑、抢运“粮草”的战斗，正在鞍钢运输部门热烈进行着。二百多名过去当过司机的厂长、站长、段长，老将出马，重操旧业，到前线表演多拉快跑。在老将们带动下，运输职工每天从原料基地，给烧结总厂运来大量矿粉。12月中旬比上旬多运了十几万吨，为明年开门红准备下了足够的“粮草”。
    看着钢铁英雄们的英雄行动，我们满腹激情地高呼：振翅高飞吧，鞍钢，你这钢铁的雄鹰！
