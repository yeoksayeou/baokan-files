Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 24th: Daye Steel Plant achieved a production "all-round red" this year with high output, high quality, low cost, and high efficiency. The annual total output value plan was completed 42 days ahead of schedule; the steel and steel material output plan was completed 21 days ahead of schedule; the quality of steel and steel materials exceeded planned requirements; new product trial production plans were also overfulfilled; labor productivity completed the plan 49 days ahead of schedule; and the cost plan was completed 21 days ahead of schedule. Currently, the plant is vigorously preparing for next year's production, striving for a "red" start next year.
	Since the beginning of this year, the plant has adopted the mass line method of conveying the situation, assigning tasks, conveying difficulties, and conveying measures from top to bottom, and discussing, summarizing, inspecting, and comparing from bottom to top when arranging production plans every quarter and every month, constantly mobilizing the masses to eliminate difficulties and ideological obstacles on the road ahead. They adopted the method of grasping early, grasping tightly, and grasping specifically for the production plan, and established a system of the plant grasping daily plans, the workshop grasping shift plans, the shift grasping hourly plans, and pre-shift arrangements, mid-shift inspections, and post-shift summaries; they implemented long-term plans and short-term arrangements, ensuring that plans were grasped at every level and by everyone. In addition, they focused on the "five firsts" in the production plan, namely, grasping the first month of the quarter, the first ten days of the month, the first day of the ten days, the first shift of the day, and the first hour of the shift, to ensure a "red" start to production and strive for the initiative to complete the plan.
	In order to increase steel production, the entire plant, under the leadership of the Party committee, established a "problem-solving" headquarters, and workshops established "problem-solving" groups and shock brigades. Focusing on key issues such as equipment matching and shortening smelting time, as well as turning bad iron into good steel, they continuously organized five mass "problem-solving" campaigns through large-scale collaboration and technical performance competitions, successively overcoming more than 3,700 production bottlenecks, which continuously improved the daily output level of steel and steel materials, ensuring that the entire plant completed the annual plan ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th: Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant has already completed the annual production tasks ahead of schedule and comprehensively exceeded the quota. As of December 15th, pig iron production exceeded the plan by 16,000 tons, the average pig iron qualification rate increased by 1% compared to the plan, the cost was reduced by 3.81% compared to the plan, and labor productivity completed 100% of the plan.
	The average utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces in this plant this year reached 2.4, an increase of 0.547 compared to last year, constantly winning the honor of collective champion in utilization coefficient among large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide.
	The plant's newly added production tasks for converter steel and small-sized steel materials have also been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota.

　　钢铁工人又放新年礼花
    大冶钢厂钢和钢材提前二十一天完成年计划
    本溪第一钢铁厂生铁产量已超额一万六千吨
    据新华社武汉24日电　大冶钢厂今年实现了高产、优质、低成本、高效率的生产满堂红。全年总产值计划提前四十二天完成；钢和钢材产量计划提前二十一天完成；钢和钢材质量都超过计划要求；新产品试制计划也超额完成；劳动生产率提前四十九天完成计划；成本计划提前二十一天完成。目前，这个厂正在大抓明年的生产准备工作，争取明年开门红。
    今年以来，这个厂在每季、每月布置生产计划时，都采取了自上而下地交形势、交任务、交困难、交措施，和自下而上地讨论、总结、检查、评比的群众路线的方法，不断地发动群众扫除前进道路上的困难和思想障碍。他们对生产计划采取抓早、抓紧、抓具体的办法，建立了厂抓日计划，车间抓班计划，班抓小时计划和班前布置、班中检查、班后总结的制度；实行长计划短安排，做到了层层抓计划，人人抓计划。另外他们在生产计划上还大抓五个第一，即季抓第一月，月抓第一旬，旬抓第一天，天抓第一班，班抓第一小时，保证生产一开始就红，争得完成计划的主动权。
    为了提高钢的产量，全厂在党委领导下成立了“攻关”指挥部，车间成立“攻关”小组和突击队，围绕着设备配套和缩短冶炼时间以及坏铁炼好钢等关键，采取大协作和开展技术表演赛等办法连续组织了五次群众性的“攻关”运动，先后攻下了三千七百多个生产关键，使钢和钢材的日产水平不断提高，保证全厂提前完成了全年计划。
    据新华社沈阳24日电　本溪第一钢铁厂已经提前全面超额完成全年的生产任务。到12月15日止，生铁产量超过计划一万六千吨，生铁合格率平均比计划提高1％，成本比计划降低3.81％，劳动生产率完成计划百分之百。
    这个厂今年以来的高炉平均利用系数达到二点四，比去年提高零点五四七，不断赢得全国大中型高炉利用系数集体冠军的荣誉。
    这个厂今年新增的转炉钢和小型钢材的生产任务，也已经提前超额完成了。
