Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: More than two million ethnic minority herdsmen across the country have ended their nomadic lives of wandering for water and grass for thousands of years and have basically achieved settlement. New market towns and villages are constantly being built on the vast grasslands. People have houses and livestock have pens, presenting a joyous scene of prosperity for both people and livestock everywhere.

The people's commune system in pastoral areas has greatly accelerated the implementation of settling nomadic people. The communes have relatively strong construction funds and can uniformly allocate labor, which is very beneficial for carrying out this work in a planned way. All people's communes on the Inner Mongolia grasslands are making comprehensive plans for settlement based on production conditions and are actively building settlements. The settlement points of the people's communes in Xinjiang's pastoral areas have reached about 2,000. In the Altay Prefecture, where the Kazakh people live, the people's communes have built and expanded 150 settlement villages this year, allowing more than 80,000 Kazakh herdsmen to move into new homes. In Qinghai Province, nomadic settlements have spread all over the grasslands. Some places that were once desolate and infested with wolves and bears are now being built into bustling towns by the people's communes. In Gansu Province, 70% of the more than 200,000 ethnic minority herdsmen have settled down, and more than 10,000 new houses have been built in this year alone.

After the vast number of herdsmen achieved settlement, under the unified leadership of the people's communes, the single animal husbandry economy is gradually being replaced by a new pastoral economy that "focuses on animal husbandry, combines agriculture and animal husbandry, and develops diversified operations," and all aspects of production are flourishing. The people's communes in pastoral areas dispatch a portion of young and strong male and female herdsmen to graze outside, focusing on raising cattle and sheep. Another part of the commune's labor force settles down to carry out grassland construction. They reclaim farmland, build water conservancy projects, expand grain and fodder bases, strive to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in grain and fodder, and build sheds and pens in the settlements to store sufficient fodder to ensure the relatively stable and high-speed development of animal husbandry. This year, the communes in the Inner Mongolia pastoral area planted 1.4 million mu of grain and fodder and stored 7.2 billion jin of green grass; the new sheds and pens built in the settlements and winter camps numbered more than 193,600, and with the addition of the old sheds and pens, the vast majority of the region's breeding stock and young stock have cold-proof equipment. After some communes in the Qinghai pastoral area achieved settlement, they vigorously developed water conservancy, solving the problem of water shortage in the grasslands that had been impossible to solve for many years, making the pastures lush and flourishing, and the livestock were well-fed and strong. Zhaosu County in Xinjiang also relied on outside supplies of grain last year. This year, the county increased grain production by more than 58%, achieving self-sufficiency, and the number of various livestock developed to more than 370,000, a net increase of 38% compared to last year. In the Gansu grasslands and Subei Ranch, herdsmen who reclaimed wasteland and tried to plant crops also frequently reported good news of bumper harvests of both livestock and grain. Some communes in Gannan have also started pastoral scientific research work near the settlements.

While agriculture and animal husbandry are leaping forward, grassland industry has also developed accordingly. The Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia, a purely nomadic area, had no industry at all in the past. After communization, herdsmen built thousands of small dairy processing plants in their settlements, as well as many small hydropower stations, fur processing plants, agricultural and pastoral machinery plants, and shoe factories. Herdsmen in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang have also built thousands of industrial units. On the Heqa grassland in Qinghai, the people's communes have already unveiled the prelude to running industry on the grasslands.

Settling nomadic people has not only brought about tremendous changes in the pastoral economy, but also brought a new life to the vast number of herdsmen. Herdsmen began to have a stable and comfortable family environment. The elderly, children, pregnant women, and frail and sick herdsmen no longer brave the wind, snow, frost, and dew to wander with the herds. Many people's communes in Qinghai built a large number of earthen or thatched houses for their members in the settlements. In the Inner Mongolia pastoral area, tens of thousands of earth-wood structures and yurts have replaced the ancient felt yurts. Many ethnic minority herdsmen were all smiles when they moved from tents and felt packs into new houses with heated brick beds and glass windows. The old herdsman Jia Manzhi of Yongfeng Commune in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, Gansu, happily said after moving into a warm and bright new home: "In the past, I wore a sheepskin and didn't know where I would die. Now the Communist Party has brought us into 'paradise'." Now, cultural and health care institutions have been established throughout the settlements. Children and adults have the opportunity to study, and they can receive timely treatment when they get sick. All the people's communes have set up collective welfare undertakings, and some communes have also installed broadcasting equipment, allowing herdsmen to know about national affairs, hear weather forecasts, and enjoy music while sitting at home. After settling down, many herdsmen have added furniture, suitcases, sewing machines, and thermos bottles to their homes. They also plant trees, melons, and vegetables, and raise chickens and pigs near their homes, making their lives richer than in the past.

Ethnic minority herdsmen have received strong support from the state and the Han people in the process of moving from nomadic to settled life. The state has allocated a large amount of funds and timely supplied various materials such as machinery and timber to help herdsmen carry out grassland construction. In the Inner Mongolia pastoral area alone, the government allocated 2.88 million yuan from 1955 to July of this year. In some settlements, the state helped herdsmen establish mechanical water supply stations, veterinary stations, factories, schools, shops, hospitals, and bookstores, and cinemas, making these settlements gradually form new economic and cultural centers on the grasslands. Many Han cadres and Han farmers near the pastoral areas enthusiastically helped herdsmen build houses and water conservancy projects, and patiently taught agricultural production knowledge. They enhanced national friendship in their joint labor.

    结束千百年来逐水草而居的游牧生活
    二百万少数民族牧民实现定居
    辽阔草原上不断建起新的集镇和村落　人有屋畜有圈人畜两旺
    开垦农田扩大粮食饲料基地　以牧为主农牧结合发展多种经营
    新华社13日讯　全国已有二百多万少数民族牧民，结束了千百年来逐水草而居的游牧生活，基本上实现了定居。辽阔的草原上，不断建起新的集镇和村落。人有屋、畜有圈，到处呈现人畜两旺的欢乐景象。
    牧区人民公社化大大加速了定居游牧的推行。公社拥有较为雄厚的建设资金，又能统一调配劳力，对有计划地进行这项工作十分有利。内蒙古草原上所有的人民公社，都在根据生产情况作出定居的全面规划，积极地建设定居地。新疆牧区人民公社的定居点，已达两千个左右。在哈萨克族聚居的阿勒泰专区，各人民公社今年新建和扩建了一百五十个定居村，使八万多哈萨克牧民搬进新居。在青海省，牧民定居点已遍布草原，有些地方不久以前还是荒无人烟、狼熊出没，而今被人民公社建设成热闹的村镇。甘肃省二十多万少数民族牧民已有70％定居下来，今年一年内就新盖了上万座房屋。
    广大牧民实现定居之后，在人民公社统一领导下，单一的畜牧经济正在逐步被“以牧为主、农牧结合、发展多种经营”的新的牧区经济所代替，各项生产蒸蒸日上。牧区人民公社都派遣一部分年轻力壮的男女牧民出外游牧，专心饲养牛羊。公社的另一部分劳动力则定居下来，进行草原建设。他们开垦农田、兴修水利，扩大粮食饲料基地，争取逐步达到粮食和饲料自给，并在定居地搭棚修圈，贮备充足的饲草，以保证畜牧业比较稳定的高速度发展。内蒙古牧区各公社今年种植了一百四十万亩粮食和饲料，并贮备了七十二亿斤青草；在定居地和冬营地上新建的棚圈，有十九万三千六百多座，加上旧的棚圈，使全区绝大多数母畜、幼畜有了防寒设备。青海牧区有些公社实现定居后，大兴水利，解决了多年无法解决的草原缺水问题，使牧草丰美繁茂，牲畜吃得膘肥体壮。新疆昭苏县去年还依靠外地供应口粮，今年全县增产粮食58％以上，自给有余，各种牲畜发展到三十七万多头，比去年净增38％。在甘肃草原和肃北牧场，开荒试种庄稼的牧民，也纷纷传出牧畜、粮食双丰收的喜讯。甘南有的公社还在定居点附近，开始了牧业科学试验工作。
    在农牧业双跃进的同时，草原工业也相应地有了发展。内蒙古的纯游牧区锡林郭勒草原，过去根本没有工业，公社化以后牧民们在定居地上兴建了成千座小型乳品加工厂，还有许多小型水力发电站、皮毛加工厂、农牧机具厂、制靴厂等。新疆伊犁哈萨克族自治州的牧民，也建起成千个工业单位。在青海河卡草原上，人民公社已经揭开了草原办工业的序幕。
    定居游牧不仅使牧区经济发生巨大变革，并且给广大牧民带来新的生活。牧民们开始有了安定舒适的家庭环境，老人、儿童、孕妇和病弱牧民，不再冒着风雪霜露，跟随畜群飘泊四方。青海许多人民公社在定居地上，为社员们建造了大批土房或草房。在内蒙古牧区，成千上万间土木结构的房屋和蒙古包，代替了古老的毡蒙古包。许多少数民族牧民从帐房、毡包迁入烧有热炕、安着玻璃窗的新屋时，笑逐颜开。甘肃天祝藏族自治县永丰公社的老牧民贾满志，搬进温暖明亮的新居之后，高兴地说：“从前一张羊皮披上身，生死不知在何方，如今共产党把我们带进了‘天堂’。”现在，各定居地上普遍建立了文化和卫生医疗机构，儿童和成年人都有学习的机会，生了病可以及时得到治疗。各人民公社都办起集体福利事业、有些公社还安装了广播设备，让牧民们坐在家中便知道国家大事，听到气象预报和欣赏音乐。许多牧民定居之后，添置桌柜、皮箱、缝纫机、热水瓶等家庭用具。他们在住屋附近还种上树、瓜和蔬菜，养鸡、养猪，生活内容比过去丰富了。
    少数民族牧民在从游牧走向定居的过程中，得到国家和汉族的大力帮助。国家曾拨给大批资金，及时供应机械、木材等各种物资，扶助牧民进行草原建设。仅内蒙古牧区从1955年到今年7月，政府就拨给二百八十八万元。在有些定居地上，国家帮助牧民兴办了机械供水站、兽医站、工厂、学校、商店、医院、书店和电影院，使这些定居地逐渐形成为草原上新型的经济文化中心。许多汉族干部和牧区附近的汉族农民，热情地帮助牧民建造房屋、兴修水利，耐心教给农业生产知识。他们在共同劳动中，增进了民族友谊。
