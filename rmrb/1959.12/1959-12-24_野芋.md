　　Wild Taro

    Wild taro, also known as water taro, is similar in shape to cultivated taro. It is distributed along small rivers, likes warmth and is resistant to waterlogging, and grows all year round. It is harvested from May to September, with the most abundant harvest in June and July. After the leaves of the wild taro are cut, they will regenerate in half a month to a month. Generally, the stems and leaves are washed, cut short, boiled and then used to feed pigs. (Attached picture)

　　野芋
    野芋又名水芋，形态与栽培的芋头相似，分布在小河边，性喜温耐涝，全年都会生长，5月到9月采集，以6月、7月为最多。野芋叶割后，经半个月到一个月又会再生。一般是把茎叶洗净，切短，煮后喂猪。（附图片）
