Advanced Schools Help Less Advanced Ones; Old Schools Guide New Schools
Fuzhou Middle Schools Work Together for a Great Leap Forward

(Our report) The inter-school teaching research groups established by various middle schools in Fuzhou City have played an important role in carrying out inter-school mutual assistance and cooperation, and continuously improving and raising the quality of teaching.

Fuzhou City currently has twenty-six middle schools, with more than 1,300 teachers and more than 30,000 students. Among these schools, some older schools have a better foundation and more teaching experience; while some middle schools were developed from remedial schools or primary schools to meet the needs of the masses, and are generally smaller in scale and have a weaker foundation. Among the teachers, there are some young teachers with limited teaching experience. Therefore, it is very important to strengthen teaching research and exchange of teaching experience between schools and between new and old teachers.

The Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the education administrative departments frequently organize new and old teachers from various middle schools to visit each other, observe teaching, and exchange teaching experiences according to the needs of teaching and the demands of teachers. In order to persist in this work with leadership and organization, city-wide teaching research groups have also been established. In their work, the inter-school teaching research groups first concentrate their efforts on running some key middle schools well, so that they can play a demonstrative role in teaching and lead and help general and less well-off schools to advance together. When carrying out activities, the inter-school teaching and research group pays great attention to cultivating a group of outstanding teachers as the backbone of the inter-school teaching and research group's research in various subjects, carrying out teaching and research activities or conducting demonstration teaching. At the same time, it emphasizes that through regular teaching activities, teachers should be organized to study Marxism-Leninism, current affairs, and policies, and lead them to actively participate in political movements and production practices, so as to improve their political awareness and establish a new atmosphere of teaching and learning from each other, so that inter-school teaching and research work can be continuously consolidated and developed. Fuzhou City has selected six middle schools with better teacher qualifications and teaching equipment as key points, and has given strong support in terms of human and material resources. The Party committee and the education administrative department also frequently send working groups to these schools to summarize teaching experience and promptly disseminate and exchange these experiences in the inter-school teaching and research group. The inter-school teaching and research group also adopted methods such as helping new teachers prepare lessons, providing teaching reference materials, and putting forward key points, to drive general or less well-off schools to improve together. In the past, the teaching foundation of Fuzhou No. 6 Middle School was poor. After the help of the teaching and research group, the average score of students participating in the college mathematics examination this year reached 81.09 points, an increase of 32.95 points compared with last year.

The inter-school teaching research group is organized on the basis of the teaching research groups of various schools. It includes eleven subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, Chinese, politics, music, and physical education. The central research group of each subject is composed of the heads of the teaching and research groups and excellent teachers from various schools. Each subject has half a day a week as the activity time for the inter-school teaching and research group. Their specific activities are carried out under the leadership of the Party committee and the education administrative department, focusing on the party's educational policy, the teaching tasks of each subject, and the problems encountered in the teaching of each subject. Therefore, through this organization, relevant creations and experiences can be quickly disseminated.

In carrying out various activities, the inter-school teaching and research group also pays attention to improving the political level and teaching ability of teachers from both political and professional aspects. They also regularly organize teachers to study Marxist-Leninist theory and participate in various political movements and production practices. They also hold teachers' spare-time training classes and organize teachers to conduct systematic advanced studies in combination with teaching. At the same time, they also establish close ties with nearby colleges and universities, and invite professors and lecturers to hold various scientific lectures. (Attached picture)

　　先进帮后进　老校带新校
    福州各中学携手共跃进
    本报讯　福州市各中等学校建立的校际教学研究组，对开展校际互助协作，不断改进和提高教学质量，起了重要作用。
    福州市现有中学二十六所，教师一千三百多人，学生三万多人。在这些学校中，有一部分老校基础较好，教学经验也较丰富；也有一些中学是为了适应群众的需要，由原来补习学校或从小学发展起来的，一般规模较小，基础较差。在教师中有一部分青年教师，教学经验不多。因此，加强校与校、以及新老教师之间的教学研究和交流教学经验的工作十分重要。
    中共福州市委和教育行政部门根据教学上的需要和教师们的要求经常组织各中学新、老教师互相访问，观摩教学，交流教学经验。为了把这一工作有领导有组织的坚持下去，又建立了全市性教学研究组。校际教学研究组在工作中，首先集中力量办好一些重点中学，使它在教学中起示范作用，带动和帮助一般的和条件较差的学校共同前进。校际教研组在开展活动的时候，很注意培养一批优秀教师作为校际教研组各学科研究的骨干，开展教研活动或进行示范教学。同时，强调通过经常的教学活动，组织教师学习马列主义、时事政策，领导他们积极参加政治运动和生产实践，以提高政治觉悟，树立教学相长、相互学习的新风气，使校际教研工作不断地巩固和发展。福州市选择了师资条件、教学设备较好的六所中学作为重点，在人力物力上都给予大力支持，党委和教育行政部门还经常派出工作组到这些学校总结教学经验，及时在校际教研组中传播交流这些经验。校际教研组还采取帮助新教师备课，供给教学参考资料、提出重点等办法，带动了一般或基础较差的学校共同提高。福州第六中学过去教学基础较差，经过教研组的帮助，今年学生参加高等学校数学考试的平均成绩达八十一点零九分，比去年增加三十二点九五分。
    校际教学研究组是在各个学校教学研究组的基础上组织起来的，它包括数学、物理、化学、语文、政治、音乐、体育等十一个学科。每个学科的中心研究组是吸收各个学校教研组长、优秀教师组成的。各个学科每星期有半天时间作为校际教研组的活动时间。他们的具体活动，是在党委和教育行政部门的领导下，围绕着党的教育方针，各科教学任务以及各科教学中遇到的问题，开展研究。因此通过这个组织又能及时把有关方面的创造、经验，迅速传播开来。
    校际教研组在开展各种活动中，还注意从政治和业务两方面提高教师的政治水平，教学能力。他们还定期组织教师学习马列主义理论，参加各种政治运动和生产实践。他们还举办教师业余进修训练班，组织教师结合教学进行系统的进修。同时还和附近各高等院校建立密切联系，邀请教授、讲师，举办各种科学讲座等。（附图片）
