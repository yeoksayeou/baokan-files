    Protest Against Indonesian Anti-Chinese Activities; Support Foreign Minister Chen's Three Reasonable Suggestions
    Editor's Note: After the publication of Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, many returned overseas Chinese and the broad masses of workers wrote letters expressing their support for Foreign Minister Chen's suggestions. We now publish two of these letters:

    Overseas Chinese Have Shed Blood and Sweat for Indonesia; Persecuting Overseas Chinese is Tantamount to Treating Friends as Enemies
    To the Editor:
    We are returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia. After reading Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, we express our support for and endorsement of the three suggestions made by Foreign Minister Chen for a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese issue.

    We regret to learn that some reactionary forces in Indonesia have recently stirred up anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. The situation has even developed to the point where large numbers of military police are dispatched to forcibly relocate overseas Chinese, brutally beat and humiliate them, causing widespread displacement and serious threats to their personal safety. We are extremely indignant about this!

    When the Indonesian people were engaged in a heroic struggle for national independence and against Dutch colonialists, some of us joined Indonesian youth in the Battle of Surabaya, sacrificing our blood in the common fight. Some of our relatives and friends even gave their precious lives. During the one or two decades that we lived in Indonesia, we always regarded Indonesia as our second hometown and lived with the local people, sharing weal and woe. After returning to our motherland, we still cherish the brave and hardworking Indonesian people. The friendship we formed in the long-term common struggle and common life is eternal.

    Our government and people have always sympathized with and supported the Indonesian people's struggle to safeguard national independence. However, overseas Chinese in Indonesia are now being treated as enemy aliens and persecuted in every possible way. As Chinese who have shed blood and sweat for Indonesia's national independence, we cannot tolerate this act of repaying kindness with ingratitude! We want to warn the reactionary forces that are hostile to the friendship between China and Indonesia: the days when Chinese citizens could be arbitrarily bullied and humiliated are long gone! You should pull back from the brink and immediately stop these anti-China and anti-Chinese activities!

    Now, we returned overseas Chinese are living a happy and fulfilling life in our warm socialist motherland, participating in the socialist construction of our country. For overseas Chinese who are displaced in Indonesia and unwilling to continue living there, the motherland welcomes them back. In our motherland, they will receive the utmost care and have the opportunity to participate in the construction of the motherland.

    We firmly believe that with the support of a strong motherland and 650 million people, overseas Chinese struggling for survival and legitimate rights will surely achieve victory! The anti-China and anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia will surely meet with shameful failure!

    The Anti-China and Anti-Chinese Current Must Be Stopped; Friendship Between the Two Countries Should Be Cherished
    To the Editor:
    After reading Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to the Indonesian Foreign Minister, all of our overseas Chinese students at Beijing Normal College express our firm support and complete endorsement of the three suggestions put forward by our government for resolving the overseas Chinese issue.

    For a long time, some influential forces in Indonesia who are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship have been carrying out anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. Although our government has repeatedly reminded them to pay attention to this, this adverse current has not only not been stopped, but has intensified and become increasingly rampant, to the point where bloodshed has occurred during forced relocations. Some Indonesian newspapers have also taken the opportunity to incite anti-China sentiments and insult our head of state. Are these signs of friendship?

    Many of our relatives are being brutally persecuted in Indonesia, and their lives and property are not guaranteed. We cannot help but feel extremely indignant about this. We want to warn the anti-China elements in Indonesia: the era in which overseas Chinese were at the mercy of others has long passed. The powerful motherland and the 650 million Chinese people resolutely protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. The Chinese people will not tolerate anyone who imagines treating overseas Chinese as less than human, as the colonialists of the past did.

    The overseas Chinese issue is a long-standing historical problem that should be resolved fairly and reasonably in the spirit of friendship. We believe that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's suggestions fully demonstrate that our government has once again made a major effort to thoroughly resolve the overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries. We hope that the Indonesian government will value friendship and accept the suggestions of our government, hold negotiations, and reach a proper and reasonable solution to the relevant issues, so as to benefit the development of friendship between China and Indonesia.

    抗议印度尼西亚排华活动  支持陈外长三点合理建议
    编者按：我国陈毅外长给印度尼西亚苏班德里约外长的信件发表后，许多归国华侨和广大职工纷纷来信，支持陈外长的建议。现发表其中的两封来信如下：华侨为印度尼西亚出过血汗如今迫害华侨实属以友为敌
    编辑同志：
    我们是来自印度尼西亚的归国华侨，看了陈毅外长给印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约的信以后，对陈外长就全面解决华侨问题所提出的三点建议，表示拥护和支持。
    我们遗憾地知道，在印度尼西亚国内的一些反动势力，近来掀起了反华和排华活动。事态竟然发展到出动大批军警、强迫华侨迁移、野蛮殴打和凌辱华侨的地步，广大华侨因而颠沛流离，人身安全受到严重威胁，我们对此感到万分的愤慨！
    当印度尼西亚人民为争取民族独立、反对荷兰殖民主义者而进行英勇斗争时，我们当中有些人曾经和印度尼西亚青年一起，参加了泗水的保卫战，在共同战斗中献出了自己的热血。我们的一些亲友甚至献出了他们宝贵的生命。在我们侨居印度尼西亚的一、二十年当中，我们一向把印度尼西亚当作自己的第二故乡，并和当地人民生活在一起，同甘苦，共患难。我们回到自己祖国后，还一直怀念着勇敢勤劳的印度尼西亚人民。我们在长期的共同斗争和共同生活中形成的友谊是永恒不灭的。
    我国政府和人民也一贯同情和支持印度尼西亚人民维护民族独立的斗争。但是，现在华侨在印度尼西亚被当作敌国侨民加以对待，百般迫害。作为曾经为印度尼西亚的民族独立出过汗流过血的中国人，我们就更加不能容忍这种以怨报德的行动！我们要正告敌视中国和印度尼西亚友谊的反动势力：中国侨民被任意欺凌侮辱的时代早已一去不复返了！你们应该悬崖勒马，立即停止这种反华排华的活动！
    现在，我们归国华侨在温暖的社会主义祖国，过着美好的幸福生活，参加着祖国的社会主义建设。对于在印度尼西亚流离失所和不愿继续居留的华侨，祖国欢迎他们回来。在我们祖国，他们都会受到最大的关怀，得到参加祖国建设的机会。
    我们坚信，在强大祖国及六亿五千万人民的支持下，为争取生存和正当权益而斗争的华侨，一定会取得胜利！在印度尼西亚的反华排华活动必将遭到可耻失败！

    反华排华逆流必须制止两国之间友谊应该珍重
    编辑同志：
    我们北京师范学院全体华侨同学在读了陈毅外长写给印度尼西亚外长的信件以后，对我国政府提出的解决华侨问题的三点建议，表示坚决拥护和完全支持。
    印度尼西亚一部分敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的有影响的势力，好久以来一直就在进行反华排华活动，虽然我国政府一再提醒重视，这股逆流却不仅没有被制止，反而变本加厉，越来越猖狂，以至在武力迫迁时发生流血事件。印度尼西亚某些报刊还借此煽动反华情绪，侮辱我国元首，凡此等等，难道是友好的表示吗？
    我们之中，许多人的亲属正在印度尼西亚遭到粗暴的迫害，生命财产毫无保障。对此，我们不能不感到十分愤慨。我们要正告印度尼西亚敌视中国的分子：华侨任人宰割的时代早已成为过去了，强大的祖国和六亿五千万中国人民坚决保护华侨的正当权利和利益，谁要想像过去的殖民主义者那样不把华侨当人看待，中国人民是不能容忍的。
    华侨问题是长期历史遗留下来的问题，应该本着友好的原则求得公平合理的解决，我们认为我国陈毅外长
  的建议充分表明，我国政府为彻底解决存在于两国之间的华侨问题，又一次作出了重大的努力，我们希望印度
  尼西亚政府以友谊为重，接受我国政府的建议，举行谈
  判，就有关问题取得妥善合理的解决，以利于中国和印度尼西亚友谊的发展。
