Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 5th – At the Huanglishu Reservoir construction site in Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, a method of "focusing on one link to promote all links" has been adopted. Vigorous tool reforms have been implemented in the four processes of digging, loading, transporting, and compacting soil. As a result, the engineering tasks that originally required 10,000 people to complete can now be completed on schedule by only 3,000 people.

The dam of this medium-sized reservoir connects to mountain ridges over eighty meters high at both ends, with the Xiang River, which has a significant flow, passing through the middle. There is no readily available soil nearby. The five soil extraction sites across the construction area are generally five or six hundred meters away from the dam site, making soil transportation a very arduous task. In the early stages of construction, half of the 3,000 laborers at the site were involved in carrying soil, with an average daily efficiency of only 0.8 cubic meters per person. At this rate, the entire project would have required 10,000 people working for five months to complete.

The construction site's Party committee seized this critical issue and mobilized the masses to build factories on-site, using local wood and bamboo. In ten days, they modified and newly manufactured over 420 flatbed carts, rubber-tired carts, wheelbarrows, tricycles, pulleys, etc., and constructed pulley tracks, realizing the vehicle-ization of soil transportation and increasing the average soil transportation efficiency to 3 cubic meters per person. This meant that the original processes of digging, loading, and compacting soil could no longer meet the demands of the increased transportation efficiency. Faced with this situation, the construction site's Party committee organized all the laborers to engage in extensive debates, criticizing conservative thinking while soliciting suggestions and plans to carry out tool reforms and innovate operational methods for digging, loading, and compacting soil. Qin Youliang, the deputy county head responsible for engineering command, personally took the lead in creating an automatic soil loader that increased loading efficiency several times over. The masses also created soil extraction methods suitable for different locations. One method involved splitting soil on hillsides, which could split up to ten cubic meters at a time. Another method involved using oxen to pull double-shared plows on flat ground, which increased soil digging efficiency several times compared to shovels. In terms of soil compaction, they created a method of using manpower to pull large stone rollers, which greatly improved efficiency compared to manual ramming.

In order to quickly promote the use of these new tools and operational methods throughout the construction site, the construction headquarters adopted a method of creating, evaluating, and promoting simultaneously, ensuring that splitting methods, automatic loading methods, and others were quickly and widely adopted across the entire site. As a result, the digging, loading, and compacting processes not only kept pace with the vehicle-ization of soil transportation but also freed up 800 people to supplement the soil transportation process. Currently, the average daily efficiency of each person at the entire construction site has reached 4 cubic meters, more than three times higher than in the early stages of construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 5th – At the Chaoying Reservoir construction site in Chenxi County, Hunan Province, mechanized soil construction has been fully implemented. The average efficiency of the laborers across the entire site has rapidly increased from 1.1 cubic meters to 17.22 cubic meters, setting a record for the highest efficiency in water conservancy construction in the area in recent years. On November 29th, Lu Qingyun, the First Secretary of the Qianyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the First Secretaries of the county committees of various counties held an on-site meeting at the construction site. They unanimously agreed that this was a red banner in this year's water conservancy construction movement in the entire prefecture and decided to promote their experience throughout the prefecture.

The Chaoying Reservoir is a relatively large reservoir being newly built in Chenxi County this winter. It has a storage capacity of over 2 million cubic meters and can irrigate over 5,000 mu of farmland. It requires the excavation and filling of over 124,400 cubic meters of earth and stone, requiring a total of over 78,000 labor days. Since construction began on November 10th, all laborers and cadres have engaged in a mass movement of everyone offering suggestions and treasures by opposing Rightist tendencies and boosting enthusiasm. They have vigorously carried out tool reforms, adopting a method of progressing from small to large and from low to high, focusing on the five important processes of digging, loading, transporting, unloading, and compacting. They promptly organized over 60 technical personnel, including blacksmiths, carpenters, bamboo craftsmen, and stonemasons, to establish three on-site factories to process materials locally, modify and repair them on-site, and carry out crash programs to imitate, trial-produce, create, and improve nine types of tools. The construction site gradually achieved blasting for soil extraction, cableway, vehicle, and boat transportation, ox-powered roller compaction of soil, and automated loading and unloading, greatly reducing the labor intensity of the laborers, and various efficiencies soared. With the general increase in efficiency, the workforce at the construction site was reduced from 1,100 to 770, and the labor saved was used to support other projects and current production. The project was originally planned to be completed in 60 days, but it is now expected to be completed much sooner.

The emergence of high efficiency is due, on the one hand, to the tremendous power of soil mechanization itself, but also to the rational use and full utilization of the effectiveness of various tools. At the beginning of construction, the construction headquarters, based on natural conditions, carefully planned and arranged the construction site, made comprehensive arrangements for soil extraction, and planned the use of soil based on "far before near and low before high" to ensure a constant supply of soil. At the same time, they made rational use of the terrain, opened roads along slopes, and built bridges over water, successively opening 26 cableways, slides, wooden-rail soil train tracks, and manual and animal-powered vehicle tracks, and promoting 42 soil trains, 20 ox-drawn carts, 6 rubber-tired carts, 120 manual wheelbarrows, 3 rock transportation vehicles, 2 transportation boats, and 6 cableways. Sliding plates and funnels were also installed on large tools to achieve automated loading and unloading, with an average efficiency four to eleven times higher than manual carrying. In particular, the use of "digging"-shaped blasting holes, deep digging, and tight construction fully utilized the power of local explosive blasting for soil extraction, with each person blasting an average of 154.7 cubic meters of soil per day, increasing efficiency by 38.7 times compared to hoeing.

At the beginning of the construction of the Chaoying Reservoir, some laborers still had an unclear understanding of the important significance of large-scale water conservancy construction and the implementation of mechanized soil construction and lacked confidence. However, the commune Party committee adhered to political leadership and strengthened specific leadership. By conveying and implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on water conservancy construction, extensive debates were promptly launched on the construction site. By recalling, accounting, and comparing, the masses' awareness was raised, and they unanimously recognized that to continue the Great Leap Forward next year, it was first necessary to vigorously improve water conservancy, and it was necessary to do everything possible to improve efficiency, carry out mechanized soil construction, and strive for early completion and early benefit. On the basis of unifying thinking, a mass movement of everyone offering suggestions and treasures was launched, and the form of on-site meetings was used to conduct on-site experiments, on-site evaluations, and on-site promotions, thereby liberating thinking, breaking superstitions, and continuously generating creations and inventions, so that mechanized soil construction gradually formed from small to large and from low to high.

    技术革新促进高工效
    黄栎树水库工地三千人肩负起万人任务
    超英水库工地平均工效达到十七立方米
    新华社合肥5日电　安徽全椒县黄栎树水库工地采取“抓一环、环环促进”的办法，在挖土、装卸、运土、夯压四道工序中大力改革工具，使原来需要万人完成的工程任务，只要三千人就可以按期完成。　　这个中型水库的大坝，两端连接八十多米高的山岗，中段有流量很大的湘河通过，就近无土可取。全工地五个取土道，一般都离坝址五、六百米远，因而运土任务十分艰巨。开工初期，全工地三千民工有一半人参加挑抬，每人每日平均工效只有零点八立方米。按这样的速度，整个工程需要一万人干五个月才能完成。
    工地党委抓住这个关键性问题，发动群众就地建厂，取用附近木材竹料，用十天时间改制和新制了四百二十多部板车、胶轮车、独轮车、三轮车、滑车等，修建了滑车道，实现运土车子化，把每人平均运土工效提高到三立方米。这样，原来的挖土、装土和压土等工序，就不能适应运土效率提高后的要求了。面对这种形势，工地党委组织全体民工大鸣大放大辩论，一面批判保守思想，一面献计、献策，大搞挖土、装土、压土工具改革和革新操作方法。负责工程指挥的副县长秦友良等亲自带头创造了提高装土工效几倍的自动装土器，群众也创造了适用于不同地点的取土法。一是在山坡上劈土，一次可劈上十个立方米；二是在平地上用牛牵引双铧犁犁土，比锹挖土工效提高几倍。在压土方面，创造了人拉大石滚的方法，工效比人力打夯也大大提高。
    为了使这些新工具、新操作方法迅速在全工地推广使用，工地指挥部采取边创造、边鉴定、边推广的办法，使劈土法、自动装土法等都迅速在全工地普遍推广使用。这样，挖土、装土和压土等工序，不但跟上了运土车子化的步调，而且还减少了八百人充实到运土工序上。现在，整个工地每人平均日工效已达到四立方米，比开工初期提高工效三倍以上。
    据新华社长沙5日电　湖南辰溪县超英水库工地全面实行土机械化施工，整个工地民工平均工效由一点一立方米迅速提高到十七点二二立方米，创造了当地历年来兴修水利工效的最高纪录。11月29日，中共黔阳地委第一书记卢青云和各县县委第一书记在这个工地召开现场会议，一致认为这是全专区今年兴修水利运动中的一面红旗，决定在全专区推广他们的经验。
    超英水库是辰溪县今冬新修的一座较大的水库，它的容水量二百多万立方米，能灌溉五千多亩农田，需填挖十二万四千四百多土石方，共需劳动日七万八千多个。从11月10日开工以来，全体民工、干部通过反右倾、鼓干劲，在整个工地掀起了人人献策、个个献宝的群众运动，大搞工具改革，采取由小到大、由低到高的办法，抓住挖、装、运、卸、压五个重要工序，及时组织铁匠、木匠、篾匠、石匠等技术人员六十多人，开办三个工地工厂，就地取材加工，就地改装修理，突击仿制、试制、创制、改良了九种工具。工地逐步做到爆破取土，索道、车、船运输，牛力磙压夯土，自动装卸，大大减轻了民工的劳动强度，各项工效扶摇直上。随着工效的普遍提高，工地劳力由一千一百人减少到七百七十人，节省出来的劳动力支援了其他工程和当前生产。这个工程原来计划需要六十天完成，现在预计可以很快提前完成。
    高工效的出现，一方面是由于土机械化本身的巨大威力，但另一方面也由于合理使用，充分发挥了各种工具的效能。开工之初，工地指挥部根据自然条件，认真进行了施工场地的规划和布置，对兴工取土进行了全面安排，根据先远后近、先低后高，规划用土，保证土源能经常供应。同时合理利用地形，随坡开路，遇水搭桥，先后开辟索道、滑道、木轨土火车道、人力畜力车道共二十六条，推广土火车四十二部、牛拉车二十部、胶轮车六部、人力独轮车一百二十部、运岩车三部、运输船二只、索道六根。在大工具上还安装了滑板、漏斗，作到装卸自动化，一般平均工效比肩挑提高四倍到十一倍。特别是用掏字形炮眼，深掏、筑紧的办法，充分发挥了土炸药爆破取土的威力，每人每天平均爆破一五四点七方土，比锄挖提高工效三十八点七倍。
    超英水库在开工之初，部分民工对大修水利和实行土机械化施工的重要意义还是认识不清，信心不足的。但是公社党委坚持政治挂帅，加强具体领导。通过传达贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，和中共湖南省委对兴修水利的指示，工地上及时开展了大鸣大放大辩论，通过回忆算账对比，提高了群众觉悟，一致认识到明年要继续跃进，首先就要大力修好水利，一定要千方百计提高工效，搞土机械化施工，力争早完工，早受益。在统一思想的基础上，开展人人献策，个个献宝的群众运动，运用现场会的形式，就地试验，就地鉴定，就地推广，因此解放了思想，破除了迷信，创造发明不断涌现，使土机械化施工由小到大，由低到高，逐步形成。（附图片）
