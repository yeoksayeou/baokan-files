Build a River Transport Network in Conjunction with Water Conservancy Construction

Currently, in the mass movement to build water conservancy projects on a large scale, a mass movement to build a river transport network has also begun to take shape. Building a river transport network in conjunction with water conservancy construction is an important experience from the Great Leap Forward last year. Applying this experience, continuing to build a river transport network in the larger-scale mass movement of water conservancy construction this winter and next spring is of great significance for fully leveraging the role of water transport and tapping the potential of transportation.

China is a country with many rivers. There are more than 5,000 natural rivers with a total length of 420,000 kilometers, and more than 900 lakes of various sizes. These are extremely favorable conditions for the development of water transport in our country. Water transport requires less investment and has a large carrying capacity. Many larger rivers can be used by large fleets, and factories along the river can also solve the problem of industrial water use. This is a new trend in the industrial layout of developed countries. Since liberation, China's water transport industry, like other socialist construction undertakings, has also undergone tremendous development. By the end of 1958, the inland river navigable mileage had reached 150,000 kilometers, an increase of one time compared with before liberation, of which the navigable mileage for ships had reached 40,000 kilometers, an increase of 65.4% compared with before liberation. However, compared with the needs of national economic development, the utilization of water transport is still insufficient. Many navigable rivers have not been used for navigation, many channels are still in their natural state, and the use of irrigation canals for navigation has not yet received widespread attention. At present, with the continuous leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production and construction, the volume of transportation is constantly increasing, and higher demands are being placed on the transportation sector. Vigorously building a river transport network and fully leveraging the role of water transport is an important measure to appropriately meet the transportation needs of various sectors of the national economy. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council pointed out in the instructions on launching a mass short-distance transportation movement issued on September 25: "Wherever there are rivers that can be navigated, efforts should be made to actively improve the waterways and realize ship transportation as much as possible." We should fully understand the urgent requirements put forward by the continuous leap forward in the national economy for the development of water transport, actively improve rivers, improve the navigation conditions of existing channels, vigorously open up rivers and dig canals, and open up new channels, striving to manage every river possible, and sail on every water, so that the crisscrossing rivers and ditches in our country can be gradually developed and universally used for boats.

The scale and speed of the mass movement to build water conservancy projects this year are unprecedented. Such a favorable situation for water conservancy construction has brought extremely favorable conditions for the construction of river transport networks in the plains. The construction of river transport networks and the development of shipping are an integral and important part of water conservancy construction. On August 29, 1958, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its instructions on water conservancy work that in the construction of water conservancy projects, "the goal of fully and comprehensively utilizing water resources should be achieved, and efforts should be made to combine farmland irrigation, hydropower generation, and shipping as much as possible." In fact, many water conservancy projects can be combined with the development of shipping, such as irrigation canals can be used for boats; river network development in plains can form a river transport network; the construction of water conservancy key projects can canalize rivers and increase water depth; reservoir construction can adjust water volume and organize shipping in the reservoir area; soil and water conservation prevents soil erosion, which can reduce river sediment and prevent channel siltation. All of this shows that the construction of river transport networks and the development of shipping have a close relationship with water conservancy construction. The development of water conservancy in the past ten years has played a great role in opening up channels and developing inland river shipping, especially the mass movement of large-scale water conservancy in 1958, which pushed the construction of river transport networks to a new stage. According to incomplete statistics, about 1,500 rivers were excavated across the country last year, some plain areas realized river network development, and many mountainous areas also excavated and built irrigation canals, connecting the transportation of many counties and communes. For example, Junxian County in Henan Province implemented the principle of comprehensive utilization in water conservancy construction. From October last year to mid-October this year, the county opened up four new航线, with a length of 113 kilometers; developed 125 field navigable canals, with a length of 1,350 kilometers, basically realizing that every township is navigable, every channel is connected, and the water transportation is accessible in all directions. Without the mass movement of large-scale water conservancy, how could we imagine such a huge achievement in one year? It can be seen that the mass movement of large-scale water conservancy construction is a favorable condition for building a river transport network. As long as we seize this favorable opportunity, and actively plan for artificial canals that must be developed to connect certain rivers, so that they can gradually connect, the construction of river transport networks and inland river shipping can achieve high-speed development.

The construction of the river transport network should be closely combined with the two mass movements of water conservancy construction and short-distance transportation, instead of starting from scratch. Therefore, in the construction of the river transport network, issues such as the organization of construction teams, materials, and technical strength should be considered in conjunction with the water conservancy construction movement. At present, in view of the considerable arduousness of agricultural production tasks, it is impossible to draw a lot of labor force outside of water conservancy construction to specialize in the management of waterways, so the construction of the river transport network is mainly combined with water conservancy construction, using the rivers and canals that have been or are being managed and excavated. In those places where it is necessary and conditional to build a river transport network on a large scale, special teams can be organized to carry out the work, but labor should also be arranged in a unified way. In the construction of the river transport network, attention should also be paid to carrying out technical innovation, reforming tools, improving labor organization, and improving work efficiency. In this regard, there are already many successful experiences that should be promoted. For example, the Rengang Sluice project in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, adopted the method of hydraulic flushing, and each person can dig 25 cubic meters of soil per day, which is 18 times higher than the efficiency of manual excavation. At present, this method has begun to be promoted on the worksites of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal and the Tongyang Canal in Yangzhou. All localities should pay attention to summarizing and promoting this aspect of experience in the movement to reform tools and improve work efficiency.

The urgent problem in the construction of the river transport network is to increase the number of ships. On the one hand, we must seize the matching and installation of small power engines for wooden sailboats, and on the other hand, we must seize the work of repairing and building ships. Relevant departments of the central government and various localities have allocated a batch of small power engines to equip wooden sailboats to realize motorized towing. It is estimated that after all of these power engines are installed on ships, the transportation capacity can be increased by two times, and the labor force can be saved by half. All localities should seize the matching and installation of these power engines and strive to play a role in transportation as soon as possible. In terms of shipbuilding, we must vigorously promote the use of substitute materials. The technical problems of manufacturing steel wire mesh cement ships and fiberglass cement ships have been solved, and they can be widely promoted and used in inland river barges, store ships, and small tugboats. Reed mat boats made in Hebei Province and bamboo boats made in Sichuan Province should also be studied and promoted in areas where conditions permit.

In addition to being carried out in conjunction with the water conservancy movement, the construction of the river transport network also requires an overall plan. The river transport network of the whole country, provinces (regions), counties, and communes should have an overall long-term plan. This plan should mainly include how the river transport network should be laid out, how the channel standards should be determined, how large the scale of locks and bridges should be, how the ports, shipyards, and ship types should be developed, how to closely integrate industrial layout, how to cooperate with water conservancy projects, how to comprehensively develop with railways and highways, what should be achieved in the most recent one or two years, and what should be achieved in the next five, ten, and fifteen years. All of these should be comprehensively planned, with both short-term goals and construction prospects. Some work has been done on the planning of the river transport network in the past, especially this year, all provinces (regions) have made a preliminary plan for some major rivers in the country. In the coming winter and spring, all provinces and regions should deploy the planning tasks to the special districts, counties, and communes along with the development tasks. When considering the planning and construction of the river transport network, we must not only be farsighted, but also be down-to-earth, and implement the principle of "overall planning, comprehensive utilization; combining near and far, combining foreign and indigenous methods; gradually improving, prioritizing access before smoothness, from line to network, accessible in all directions."

The future of China's water transport industry is infinitely broad. We should seize the current favorable opportunities that the mass movement of water conservancy construction and the mass movement of short-distance transportation have vigorously developed, and work hard and strive for the upper reaches, develop and improve more channels in the coming winter and spring, and make use of more irrigation canals for navigation.

　　结合水利运动建设河运网
    目前，在大规模兴修水利的群众运动中，一个建设河运网的群众运动也已经开始形成了。结合水利运动建设河运网，这是去年大跃进中一项重要的经验。运用这个经验，在今冬明春更大规模的兴修水利的群众运动中，继续建设河运网，对于充分发挥水运的作用，挖掘运输潜力，有着重大的意义。
    我国是一个多河流的国家，全国有总长达四十二万公里的天然河流五千多条，有大小湖泊九百多个。这是我国发展水运事业的极其有利的条件。水运事业投资省、运量大，许多较大的河流都可以通过大型船队，沿河设厂又能兼而解决工业用水问题，是目前工业发达的国家工业布局的新趋势。解放以后，我国的水运事业也同其他各项社会主义建设事业一样，有了巨大的发展。内河通航里程到1958年底已达十五万公里，比解放前增加了一倍，其中通轮船的航道里程已达四万公里，比解放前增加了65.4％。但是，同国民经济发展的需要比较起来，水运的利用还是不充分的。许多可以通航的河流还没有利用起来通航，许多航道还处于自然状态，利用灌溉渠道通航也还没有引起普遍的重视。目前，随着工农业生产和建设事业的不断跃进，运输量不断增长，对运输部门提出了更大的要求。大力建设河运网，充分发挥水运的作用，是适当满足国民经济各部门对运输需要的一项重要措施。中共中央和国务院在9月25日发出的关于开展群众短途运输运动的指示中就曾指出：“凡有河流可通的地方，应当积极整治河道，尽可能地实现船运化。”我们应该充分认识国民经济不断跃进对发展水运事业提出的迫切要求，积极整治河流，改善现有航道的通航条件，大力开河挖渠，增辟新的航道，尽可能作到有河就整治，有水就行船，使我国纵横密布的江河沟渠，逐步得到开发，普遍畅通舟楫。
    今年兴修水利的群众运动，规模之大，速度之快，是过去不曾有过的。这样一个水利建设的大好形势，为平原地区河运网的建设带来了极为有利的条件。建设河运网、发展航运事业，是水利建设中不可分割的重要组成部分。1958年8月29日，中共中央在水利工作的指示中曾指出在兴修水利工程时“要达到充分地综合利用水利资源的目的，力求农田灌溉、水力发电、船运尽可能互相结合”。事实上许多水利工程都可以结合发展航运事业，如灌溉渠道可以通行舟船；平原地区河网化可以形成河运网；水利枢纽工程的建设可以使河流渠化增加水深；水库建设可以调整水量，并可以组织库区航运；水土保持防止了水土流失，可以减少河流的泥沙，防止航道的淤积。凡此等等，可见，河运网的建设、航运的发展同兴修水利有着唇齿相依、血肉相连的关系。过去十年水利事业的发展，对开辟航道、发展内河航运事业起了很大的作用，特别是1958年大兴水利的群众运动，更将河运网的建设推上一个新的阶段。据不完全的统计，去年全国约开挖了一千五百多条河流，部分平原地区实现了河网化，许多山区也开挖和修建了灌溉渠道，沟通了不少县社的交通运输。例如，河南省的浚县，在水利建设中贯彻了综合利用的原则，从去年10月到今年10月中旬，全县开辟了四条新航线，长达一百一十三公里；发展田间通航渠道一百二十五条，长达一千三百五十公里，基本上实现乡乡通航，渠渠相连，水上运输四通八达的局面。如果没有大兴水利的群众运动，怎么能设想在一年的时间里取得这样巨大的成果呢？可见，大规模兴修水利的群众运动，是大搞河运网建设的有利条件。只要抓紧这个有利时机，并对必须开发的连接某些河流的人工运河积极加以规划，使之逐渐连通，就可以使河运网的建设和内河航运事业得到高速度的发展。
    河运网的建设，要紧密结合兴修水利和短途运输两个群众运动进行，而不是另起炉灶。因而在河运网的建设中，施工队伍的组织、材料、技术力量等问题，都要与兴修水利运动结合起来考虑。目前，鉴于农业生产任务相当繁重，不可能在水利建设之外抽调很多劳动力来专门治理航道，所以河运网的建设主要是结合兴修水利，利用已经或者正在治理和开挖的河道和渠道。在那些有必要而且又有条件大规模建设河运网的地方，可以组织专门队伍进行，但是也要统一安排劳动力。在河运网建设中，同样要注意大搞技术革新，改革工具，改善劳动组织，提高工效。在这方面，已经有不少成功的经验，应该注意推广。例如江苏省南通市任港船闸工程，采用水力冲土的办法，每人每日可挖土二十五方，比人工挖土工效提高了十八倍。目前这个办法已经开始在扬州的京杭大运河和通扬运河等工地上推广。各地在改革工具，提高工效的运动中，都应该注意总结和推广这方面的经验。
    目前河运网建设中的迫切问题是增加船舶，一方面要抓紧木帆船小型动力机的配套和安装工作，一方面要抓紧修造船舶的工作。中央有关部门和各地已经调拨一批小型动力机用来武装木帆船，实现机动拖带。估计这批动力机全部安装上船后，运量可以增加两倍，劳动力可以节省一半。各地应该抓紧这批动力机的配套和安装工作，争取及早在运输中发挥作用。在造船方面，要大力提倡使用代用材料，现在制造钢丝网水泥船和玻璃丝水泥船的技术问题已经解决，可以在内河驳船、囤船、小型拖轮等方面大量推广使用。河北省制成的苇席船、四川省制成的竹篾船，在有条件的地区也应该研究推广。
    河运网的建设除了结合水利运动进行以外，也还需要有一个全面规划。全国、省（区）、县、公社的河运网，都应该有一个全面的长远的规划。这个规划，主要应该包括河运网怎么布局，航道标准怎么确定，船闸桥梁的尺度多大，港口、船厂、船型如何发展，如何紧密结合工业布局，如何与水利工程配合，如何与铁路公路综合发展，最近一两年达到什么样子，今后五年、十年、十五年要达到什么样子，所有这些，都要全面规划，既有近期目标，又有建设远景。河运网规划过去已经作了一些工作，特别是今年各省（区）对全国一些主要河流都作了一次初步规划。各省、区在今冬明春应把规划任务随同开发任务布置到专、县和公社。在考虑河运网规划和建设时，既要高瞻远瞩，也要脚踏实地，贯彻“全面规划、综合利用；远近结合、洋土并举；逐步提高，先通后畅，由线到网，四通八达”的方针。
    我国水运事业的前途是无限广阔的。应当抓紧当前兴修水利的群众运动和短途运输的群众运动已经蓬勃开展的有利时机，鼓足干劲、力争上游，在今冬明春开发和整治更多的航道，把更多的灌溉渠道利用起来通航。
