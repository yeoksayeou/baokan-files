　　American Monopoly Capitalists and Arms Production
　　Lè Shān
    On the lintel above an entrance to the Pentagon, the U.S. Department of Defense, is inscribed half a sentence from the Gospel of Matthew in the “New Testament”: “For to everyone who has, more will be given.” The original words in the "Bible" are: “For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.” These two sentences aptly depict the relationship between the U.S. government, representing the interests of monopoly capitalists, and the American working people.
    The U.S. government spends more than $40 billion annually (60% of total budget expenditures) on arms expansion and war preparations. This money is squeezed from the bones and marrow of ordinary American taxpayers. However, American monopoly capitalists are making a fortune from this massive military expenditure. Colluding with officials in the Pentagon, they use various cunning methods to control all government military orders, from which they extract huge profits. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. In the eyes of the U.S. government and Pentagon officials, this is the most reasonable thing to do, because they are loyal servants employed by the monopoly capitalists.

    Cunning Methods
    The U.S. "Atomic Energy Act" stipulates that the U.S. atomic energy industry is "state-owned" and is handed over to large-scale, well-equipped electrical and chemical companies for "operation." What is going on here? It turns out that American monopoly capitalists are unwilling to bear the huge equipment costs and the training costs of specialized technical personnel for the atomic industry. The U.S. government uses money squeezed from taxpayers to build factories and train technical personnel, and then hands over all atomic factories and laboratories to monopoly groups through "contracts." In this way, American monopoly capitalists own the atomic industry without paying a penny, and extract huge profits from the production of atomic weapons.
    From 1942 to June 1959, the U.S. government spent a total of $21 billion under the "Atomic Energy Program." In the fiscal year 1942-1943, the U.S. "Atomic Energy Program" cost only $77 million. By the 1958-1959 fiscal year, the "Atomic Energy Program" had increased to approximately $2.63 billion. In the 1959-1960 budget, this cost will reach $2.745 billion.
    The U.S. atomic energy industry and atomic weapons production are controlled by the following companies: General Electric, controlled by the Morgan consortium; Western Electric; Monsanto Chemical; Westinghouse Electric, jointly controlled by the Rockefeller and DuPont consortiums; Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, jointly controlled by the Rockefeller and Mellon consortiums; DuPont, controlled by the DuPont consortium; Phillips Petroleum, within the DuPont consortium's sphere of influence, and so on.
    Because these companies have monopolized the U.S. government's atomic industry and atomic weapons production, their assets increased by 2.5 to 3 times from 1946 to 1957. In 1958, although the profits of general industry in the United States declined, the profits of these companies increased. Examples are as follows:
　　Company Name	Assets in 1946	Assets in 1957	Net Profit in 1958
　　(Unit: Million USD)
　　DuPont	965	2,756	341
　　General Electric	857	2,361	242
　　Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation	439	1,456	124
　　Westinghouse	503	1,401	74
　　Phillips Petroleum	332	1,519	84
    Stealing the sky and changing the sun under the name of "state-owned" and extracting a large amount of wealth from the atomic energy industry and atomic weapons production is the magic trick by which the U.S. government and monopoly capitalists collude to suck the blood and sweat of the working people.

    The Way to Make Money
    From 1951 to 1956, the ten largest companies that occupied the most important position in U.S. arms production received a total of $38.5 billion in military orders. General Motors ranked first, receiving a total of $6.874 billion in military orders. Boeing, United Aircraft, and General Electric each received more than $4 billion. Douglas Aircraft, North American Aviation, General Dynamics, and Lockheed Aircraft each received more than $3 billion. Curtiss-Wright and Republic Aircraft each received more than $2 billion.
    In 1957, after the U.S. warmongering and aggressive group began to vigorously develop missile production, the rankings of major U.S. arms production companies changed greatly. General Dynamics jumped to first place. In 1957, the company received $1.1 billion in military orders. General Electric jumped to second place. American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Martin Company, which ranked 13th and 23rd respectively during the Korean War, jumped to 5th and 9th places.
    Why is there such a big change? It turns out that the U.S. government and monopoly capitalists have other magic tricks.
    In order to use the power and influence of the military to compete for military orders, General Dynamics recruited a large number of retired senior generals to join the company's board of directors and serve as company leaders. For example, Frank Pace Jr., the general manager of General Dynamics, was the Secretary of the Army; Earl D. Johnson, the deputy general manager, was the Assistant Secretary of the Army and the Undersecretary of the Army; Gordon Dean, the deputy general manager, was the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission; Joseph T. McNarney, the deputy general manager, was the commander of the U.S. forces in the European theater; Laurence B. Richardson, the deputy general manager, was a Vice Admiral; William Palmer Dixson, a director, was the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Ninth Air Force.
    These people's salaries are extremely generous. Through various personal relationships, they won a large number of military orders for General Dynamics. The senior generals in office also "treat" General Dynamics with "special consideration," considering their "way out" after retirement.
    In March 1958, Pace reported to shareholders at the annual meeting of General Dynamics: "Regardless of any temporary recession, General Dynamics shareholders have ample reason to share future profits for a long time."
    In 1957, General Dynamics' net profit rose to $44.3 million, an increase of 32% over 1956. In 1958, amid widespread profit declines, General Dynamics still achieved a huge profit of $36.72 million.
    Since the United States stepped up missile production, American Telephone and Telegraph—the American Telephone Company—has also played an increasingly important role in military production. Its subsidiary, Western Electric, sold $660 million worth of "Nike" missiles and other military equipment to the U.S. Department of the Army in 1957, more than eleven times the amount in 1950, accounting for one-quarter of the company's sales in 1957.
    Different from General Dynamics' method of recruiting senior generals to serve as directors, American Telephone and Telegraph Company sent its employees to serve in important military positions. Callis, the director of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company Research Institute, has successively served as the Secretary of the Air Force and the Undersecretary of Defense for the U.S. government. According to American columnist Pearson, fourteen employees of American Telephone and Telegraph Company are working in the Department of the Army, holding various positions from Undersecretary downwards.
    Martin Company, which is engaged in the production of the "Vanguard" rocket and the "Titan" missile, is a company jointly controlled by the Rockefeller consortium and the Mellon consortium. Martin Company built a magnificent villa on an island called Eleuthera in the Bahamas. It is specially used to entertain senior American generals for free on weekends.
    The "New York Times" stated on December 6 this year that a congressional investigation committee announced the names of twenty-seven senior generals who frequently enjoyed free hospitality at Martin Company's villa, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Twining, and others.
    Martin Company's money is not spent in vain. According to a message revealed by the Associated Press in November this year, the U.S. Department of Defense has authorized the Air Force to spend money to continue producing Martin Company's "Mars" missile. Congress has also expressed no opposition to the "Mars" program. In this way, Martin Company can get another sum of up to 100 million U.S. dollars.

    Merchants in Congress
    Whether it is the abolition of a military base or the cancellation of a military order contract, it will cause a major dispute in the U.S. Congress that involves the President and the Department of Defense. What is the reason for this?
    In order to ensure their military "big business," American monopoly capitalists have not only arranged their agents in the government but also in Congress.
    The July 13, 1959 issue of "U.S. News & World Report" revealed that the members of Congress from the states most deeply involved in the arms program hold important positions in the U.S. Congress that can protect the interests of the monopoly capitalists they represent. "Therefore, any reduction—whether it is a reduction in the total amount on the payroll, the cancellation of projects, or the cancellation of military orders—will immediately cause a reaction. Congressmen are very sensitive to changes in military business or military facilities in their state."
    For American monopoly capitalists, military bases and other military facilities are as important as military orders. "U.S. News & World Report" said: "Currently, there are nearly 700 various important military facilities, from large-scale sea and air force bases to smaller armories. On average, each state should have fourteen facilities, but California accounts for ninety-seven, Texas forty-nine, and Virginia forty… The total military facilities and equipment in the forty-eight states (excluding Alaska) are equivalent to the government's investment of approximately $112 billion.
    "Whenever a new base is established, or an old base is greatly expanded, there is a construction business. Military construction contracts are around 1.4 billion U.S. dollars per year. California has the largest number, accounting for about 14%, New York accounts for about 7%, and Texas accounts for nearly 6%."
    In Congress, four members of the House Armed Services Committee are from California, and three are from New York. The person in charge of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee is a congressman from Texas. In the Senate, the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the Defense Program Oversight Subcommittee is also a Texan. In total, twelve states that account for most of the defense business occupy nineteen of the thirty-nine seats on the House Armed Services Committee, eight of the seventeen seats on the Appropriations Subcommittee of the House that controls the financial bill for defense programs, and six of the seventeen seats on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
    The collusion and collaboration between monopoly capitalists and members of Congress explain why U.S. military spending increases every year; it also explains why U.S. monopoly groups and their servants constantly advocate the "Cold War" and fear the relaxation of the international situation.

　　美国垄断资本家与军火生产
　　乐山
    在美国国防部的五角大楼一个入口的门楣上，题着“新约圣经”马太福音中的半句话：“凡有的，还要加给他”。“圣经”上原来的话是：“凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有余。凡没有的，连他所有的也要夺去。”这两句话，恰如其分地描绘了代表垄断资本家利益的美国政府和美国劳动人民之间的关系。
    美国政府每年要花四百多亿美元（占预算支出总额的60％）进行扩军备战。这些钱都是从美国普通纳税人的身上敲骨吸髓搜刮来的。可是，美国垄断资本家却从这笔庞大的军费开支中，大发横财。他们同五角大楼里官员们串通起来，使用各种诡诈的手法，控制政府的一切军事订货，从中攫取丰厚的利润。富的愈富，穷的愈穷，在美国政府和五角大楼的官员们看来，那是最合理不过的事了，因为他们是垄断资本家雇用的忠顺的仆从。
    狡黠的手法
    美国的“原子能法案”规定，美国的原子能工业是“国有的”，由政府交给规模巨大、设备完善的电气公司、化学公司去“经营”。这是怎么一回事呢？原来美国垄断资本家不愿意承担原子工业的庞大的设备费用和专门技术人员的训练费用，美国政府就用从纳税人身上搜刮来的钱建厂和训练技术人员，然后用“合同”的方式，把所有的原子工厂、实验室都交给垄断集团。这样，美国垄断资本家就不费分文地拥有了原子工业，从原子武器生产中攫取大量利润。
    从1942—1959年6月，美国政府在“原子计划费”项目下，共用去二百一十亿美元。在1942—1943年的财政年度中，美国的“原子计划费”只有七千七百万美元，到1958—1959年度，“原子计划费”增加到约二十六亿三千万美元，而在1959—1960年度的预算中，这项费用将达二十七亿四千五百万美元。
    美国的原子能工业和原子武器生产，是由下列一些公司分别控制的：摩根财团操纵的通用电力公司、西方电气公司、孟山都化学公司，洛克菲勒财团与杜邦财团共同操纵的威斯汀豪斯电气公司，洛克菲勒财团与梅隆财团共同操纵的联合炭素及炭化合物公司，杜邦财团的杜邦公司，杜邦财团势力范围内的菲里浦斯石油公司等。
    这些公司由于垄断了美国政府的原子工业和原子武器生产，它们的资产从1946年到1957年增加了二点五倍至三倍。1958年，尽管美国的一般工业利润下降，但这些公司的利润却是增长的。试举例如下：
　　公司名称　1946年资产　1957年资产　1958年纯利
　　（单位：百万美元）
　　杜邦公司　965　2，756 　341
　　通用电气公司　857　2，361　242
　　联合炭素及炭化合物公司　439　1，456　124
　　威斯汀豪斯公司　503　1，401　74
　　菲里浦斯石油公司　332　1，519　84
    假借“国有”的名义，偷天换日，从原子能工业和原子武器生产中攫取大量财富，这是美国政府和垄断资本家勾结起来吮吸劳动人民血汗的魔术。
    生财有道
    从1951年至1956年，在美国军火生产中占最重要地位的十家大公司，共获得军事订货款项三百八十五亿美元。通用汽车公司居于首位，共获得六十八亿七千四百万美元的军事订货。波音飞机公司、联合飞机公司、通用电气公司各获得四十多亿美元。道格拉斯飞机公司、北美航空公司、通用动力公司、洛克希德飞机公司各获得三十多亿美元。寇蒂斯—赖特和共和飞机公司各获得二十多亿美元。
    1957年，美国好战侵略集团开始大力发展导弹生产以后，美国从事军火生产的大公司的座次发生了很大的变化。通用动力公司一跃而居首位，1957年，该公司获得了十一亿美元的军事订货。通用电气公司跃居第二位。在朝鲜战争时期，军事订货分别居于第十三位和第二十三位的美国电讯公司和马丁公司一跃而居第五位和第九位。
    为什么会有这样大的变化呢？原来美国政府和垄断资本家还有另外的魔术。
    通用动力公司为了利用军人的势力和影响争夺军事订货，搜罗了一大批退役的高级将领参加公司董事会和担任公司领导工作。例如，通用动力公司的总经理小佛朗克·佩司，曾任陆军部长；副总经理厄尔·德·约翰逊，曾任陆军助理部长、陆军部副部长；副总经理戈登·迪安，曾任原子能委员会主席；副总经理约瑟夫·特·麦克纳里，曾任欧洲战场的美军司令；副总经理劳伦斯·巴·理查逊，曾任海军中将；董事维廉·帕麦尔·迪克逊，曾任第九航空队副参谋长。
    这些人的薪金极为优厚。他们通过种种人事关系为通用动力公司争取了大批的军事订货。而在职的高级将领考虑到自己退役后的“出路”，也就对通用动力公司“另眼相看”。
    1958年3月，佩司在通用动力公司的年会上向股东们作报告说：“不管任何暂时的衰退，通用动力公司的股东们有很充分的理由长期分享未来的利润。”
    1957年，通用动力公司的纯利上升到四千四百三十万美元，比1956年增加32％。1958年，在利润普遍下降声中，通用动力公司仍旧获得了三千六百七十二万美元的巨额利润。
    自从美国加紧导弹生产以来，美国电话托辣斯——美国电讯公司在军事生产上也担任了日益重要的脚色。它的子公司西方电气公司在1957年向美国陆军部出售的“奈克”式导弹和其他军事装备，价值达六亿六千万美元，超过1950年的十一倍，占该公司1957年销售额的四分之一。
    与通用动力公司搜罗高级将领充当董事会人员的手法不同，美国电讯公司派出了它的职员担任重要的军事职务。美国电讯公司研究所所长卡利斯先后充当了美国政府的空军部长、国防部副部长。据美国专栏作家皮尔逊透露，美国电讯公司的职员有十四名在陆军部任职，担任着自副部长以下的各种职务。
    从事“先锋号”火箭和“大力神”式导弹生产的马丁公司，是洛克菲勒财团和梅隆财团共同
    控制的公司。马丁公司在巴哈马群岛中一个名叫埃留特拉的岛屿上，建筑了一个富丽堂皇的别墅。专门免费招待美国的高级将领度周末。
    “纽约时报”于今年12月6日称，众议院的一个调查委员会公布了经常到马丁公司的别墅享受免费招待的二十七名高级将领的名字，其中包括参谋长联席会议主席特文宁等人。
    马丁公司的钱不是白花的。据美联社今年11月透露的消息中说，美国国防部已经授权空军花钱来继续生产马丁公司的“马斯”式导弹。国会也表示不反对“马斯”计划。这样，马丁公司又可以捞上一笔数达一亿美元的款项了。
    国会里的商人
    无论是撤销一个军事基地或是取消一笔军事订货合同，都会在美国国会中引起一场把总统和国防部都牵涉进去的大纠纷，这又是什么原故呢？
    美国垄断资本家为了确保自己的军火“大生意”，不但在政府里、也在国会中布置了他们的代理人。
    1959年7月13日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”透露，同军备计划中利害关系最深的几个州的议员，掌握着美国国会中能够保护他们所代表的垄断资本家利益的重要职位。“因此无论削减哪一方面——削减工资单上的总额也好，取消工程也好，取消军事订货也好——都会立即引起反应。国会议员们对于他们本州内军事生意或军事设施的变动都很敏感。”
    对美国垄断资本家说来，军事基地和其他军事设施与军事订货同等重要。“美国新闻与世界报道”说：“目前，各种各样重要的军事设施将近七百处，从大规模的海、空军基地直到规模较小的军火库。这些设施平均起来每州应有十四处，但是加利福尼亚州就占了九十七处，得克萨斯州四十九处，弗吉尼亚州四十处……四十八州（阿拉斯加不算在内）的全部军事设施及其装备，相当于政府约一千一百二十亿美元的投资。
    “每当设立新的基地，或者大事扩充旧基地的时候，就有了一笔建筑生意。军事建筑的合同每年在十四亿美元左右。加利福尼亚州的数目最大，约占14％，纽约州约占7％，得克萨斯州将近6％。”
    在国会里，众议院军事委员会中有四名委员是加利福尼亚州人，三名是纽约州人。国防费用拨款小组委员会负责人是得克萨斯州议员。在参议院里，多数党领袖兼防务计划监督小组委员会的主席，也是一个得克萨斯州人。总的算来，十二个占了大部分国防生意的州，在众议院军事委员会的三十九席中占了十九席，在众议院掌握防务计划的财政法案的拨款小组委员会的十七席中占有八席，在参议院军事委员会的十七席中占有六席。
    垄断资本家与议员的互相勾结、狼狈为奸，说明了为什么美国的军费开支每年有增无减；也说明了美国垄断集团及其仆从们为什么不断地鼓吹“冷战”，害怕国际局势的缓和。
