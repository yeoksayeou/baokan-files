This newspaper, Urumqi, December 1st - In the year since communization, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has reversed the slow breeding of draft horses. According to statistics from the agricultural departments, more than 80% of the region's 295,000 eligible mares have been bred, greatly exceeding any previous year; the conception rate has also increased by about 20% compared with the same period last year. Now, the people's communes are going all out to re-examine and re-breed.

In order to protect pregnant mares and ensure that they give birth to live foals and safely overwinter, the people's communes in pastoral areas have sent out survey teams to survey the routes to winter pastures. Leaders of Party organizations at all levels also personally lead the transfer of livestock to avoid injuries and miscarriages caused by unclear roads and congestion of livestock herds. In agricultural areas, the heavy use of pregnant mares in the past has also been changed, and some specific measures to protect the fetus have been formulated. Thanks to the above measures taken in pastoral and agricultural areas, there have been basically no cases of livestock abortions.

Xinjiang is a major horse-producing area in China. Before communization, due to the inability to fundamentally change the dispersed small-scale animal husbandry production situation, the survival rate of horse breeding was generally around 40%, becoming a weak link in the high-speed development of draft animals.

This year, the people's communes in pastoral areas have adopted methods of rationally using breeding stock, dividing pastures, focusing on fattening, and widely promoting artificial insemination, so that eligible mares can generally be bred when fully fattened, and the conception rate has been unprecedentedly improved. The communes in agricultural areas have also adopted the method of temporarily transferring a batch of draft horses from the animal husbandry teams to support the agricultural teams one month before breeding, and 80% of the eligible mares have been extracted and concentrated for fattening, which has also basically achieved full fattening breeding.

This newspaper, Lanzhou, December 1st - The Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province, which has historically raised very few pigs, has now become a model for the high-speed development of pig raising in pastoral areas. In the past six months, the number of pigs raised in the state has increased one and a half times, and now there are more than 96,000 heads, with an average of 1.6 pigs per household.

Pig raising in Gannan pastoral areas has developed on the basis of vigorously promoting the settlement of nomads after communization. In the past, nomads lived a nomadic life, pig pens could not be fixed, and there was a lack of feed, making it difficult to raise pigs. Only agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas near cities raised pigs. After communization, in order to develop animal husbandry at high speed and improve the lives of herders, the Party advocated the settlement of nomads, and soon more than 6,000 houses were built on the grasslands, and nearly 100 residential areas emerged.

Adapting to the new situation of settled grazing, the Party vigorously promoted pig raising in pastoral areas. Based on the characteristics of insufficient labor, lack of feed, and lush pastures in pastoral areas, *Potentilla anserina* pigs, which are fond of weeds, suitable for grazing, reproduce quickly, and have tender meat, were selected as the main breed for developing pig production in pastoral areas. In order to solve the problem of pig sources, societies, teams, and canteens have set up pig farms, and sows are not castrated or slaughtered, and a large number of piglets are bred to meet the needs of collective and commune member breeding. The communes have also collected and stored a large amount of wild grass and wild vegetables as feed. In the past six months, all agricultural and pastoral production teams in the state have raised a large number of pigs. In April of this year, there were less than 40,000 pigs, and the current number of pigs in stock is more than 96,000, a sharp increase of one and a half times, of which collective pig raising accounts for 80%.

Now, the state has launched a winter pig raising campaign, striving for continued rapid development of pig raising in 1960.

    人民公社合理使用种畜推广人工授精
    新疆适龄母马大部配种
    甘肃甘南藏族自治州半年养猪加番
    本报乌鲁木齐1日电　公社化一年，新疆维吾尔族自治区就扭转了耕马繁殖缓慢的状况。据农业部门统计，全区二十九万五千匹适龄母马，80％以上都配了种，大大超过了以往任何一年；受胎率也比去年同期提高了20％左右。现在各人民公社正全力进行复查补配。
    为了保护怀胎母马全产全活，安全过冬，牧区各人民公社都派出勘查小组，去勘查转移冬牧场的路线。各级党组织负责人也亲自领导牲畜转移工作，避免由于道路不明，畜群拥塞，造成跌伤、流产。在农业区，对怀胎母马也改变了过去使役繁重的情况，制定了一些具体保胎措施。由于在牧区和农业区分别采取了以上措施，目前基本上没有发生牲畜流产现象。
    新疆是我国主要产马区。公社化以前，由于不能从根本上改变分散的小规模的畜牧业生产状况，马的繁育成活率一般在40％左右，成为高速度发展耕畜的薄弱环节。
    今年，牧区各人民公社都采用合理使用种畜、划分草场、集中抓膘和普遍推广人工授精的办法，使适龄母马一般都能满膘配种，受胎率空前提高。农业区各公社也采取了在配种前一个月，由牧业队临时抽调一批役用马匹支援农业队的办法，把80％的适龄母马抽出来集中抓膘，也基本上实现了满膘配种。
    本报兰州1日电　历来很少养猪的甘肃省甘南藏族自治州，现在成了牧区高速度发展养猪的一个榜样。半年来全州养猪增加了一倍半，现在共有九万六千多头，平均每户养猪一点六头。
    甘南牧区养猪是在公社化后大搞牧民定居游牧的基础上发展起来的。以往，牧民过着游牧生活，猪圈不能固定，缺乏饲料，很难养猪。只有农业区和靠近城市的半农半牧区养猪。公社化后，为了高速度的发展畜牧业和改善牧民生活，党提倡牧区定居放牧，不久草原上修建了六千多间房屋，出现了近百个居民点。
    适应定居放牧的新情况，党在牧区大力提倡养猪。根据牧区劳力不足、饲料缺乏、牧草繁茂的特点，选择了喜食杂草，宜于放牧，繁殖快、肉鲜嫩的蕨麻猪，作为牧区发展养猪生产的主要品种。为了解决猪源，各社、队、食堂办起了猪场，母猪不阉不宰，大量繁殖仔猪供应集体和社员饲养的需要。各公社还大量收贮了野草野菜作为饲料。半年来，全州各个农牧业生产队已经大量养猪。今年4月猪还不足四万头，到目前实存栏数九万六千多头，猛增了一倍半，其中集体养猪占80％。
    现在，全州又掀起了冬季养猪高潮，力争1960年养猪继续迅速发展。
