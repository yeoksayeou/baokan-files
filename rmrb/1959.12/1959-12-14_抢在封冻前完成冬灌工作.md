Complete Winter Irrigation Before Freezing

Shandong Organizes Wheat Field Management Professional Teams, Irrigating 900,000 Mu Daily

Hebei Strengthens Cooperation, Nearly Half of Wheat Fields Irrigated Once

Shaanxi Promotes Trickle Irrigation Method, Greatly Improving Irrigation Efficiency

Shanxi's Winter Irrigated Area More Than Four Times Higher Than the Same Period Last Year

Gansu Formulates Reasonable Water Usage Plans Based on the Characteristics of Different Irrigation Areas

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan - Shandong is carrying out a winter wheat field irrigation campaign, striving to irrigate all wheat fields once before freezing. By the 9th, the province had irrigated more than 8.6 million mu of wheat fields, an increase of 45% over the same period last year.

Shandong's winter wheat was sown earlier and better this year, and the wheat seedlings are growing better than in any previous year. In order to thoroughly irrigate before the freeze, wheat field management professional teams have been generally organized throughout the region, irrigating more than 900,000 mu of wheat fields daily across the province. Qihe and Penglai counties, based on the imminent freezing and the urgency of the task, increased the wheat field management army from the original 110,000 to more than 150,000 people, utilizing wells, reservoirs, and water pits. Penglai County installed 700 new windmills to solve the problem of insufficient water lifting tools. These two counties irrigated more than 460,000 mu of wheat fields in three days.

In order to closely integrate water management with winter wheat irrigation, all regions are using water conservancy projects while building them, giving full play to the benefits of the projects. According to statistics from six counties and cities in the Liaocheng area, including Shou Zhang, Linqing, and Liaocheng, the Yellow River irrigation alone has newly dug and renovated more than 48,000 large and small canals, irrigating 2.35 million mu of wheat fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 13th - People's Communes in Hebei Province are carrying out a vigorous winter wheat irrigation campaign. According to statistics, as of the 5th of this month, the province had winter-irrigated 48% of its wheat fields. Zhangjiakou and Chengde, which have colder climates, have completed all irrigation.

Under the leadership of the People's Commune Party Committee, commune members in various regions have demonstrated a high degree of communist collaboration in winter irrigation. In the friendly competition between the fifteen communes and more than 800 production teams in Gaocheng County, the wealthier teams with better conditions took the initiative to help the poorer teams, and the advanced teams helped the backward teams. Six communes in this county, including Chengguan, Dachen, and Wuji, had 105 advanced teams taking out more than 200 sets of drainage and irrigation machinery to support more than 50 production teams whose wheat irrigation progress was slow due to a lack of livestock and tools, enabling these teams to carry out winter irrigation in a timely manner. All communes and teams in Anguo County greatly promoted the communist style of giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to themselves. For example, the Huozhuang and Beixuxinzhuang production teams shared a mechanized well. The Huozhuang commune members helped the Beixuxinzhuang commune members irrigate the wheat during the day, and the Beixuxinzhuang commune members took the initiative to help the Huozhuang commune members at night, resulting in the two production teams completing the winter wheat irrigation task two days ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an - Shaanxi Province has vigorously improved irrigation methods and irrigation tools. Since the winter irrigation work began in late November, more than 1.6 million mu have been irrigated.

This year, the method of trickle irrigation has been widely promoted in winter irrigation. The irrigated wheat fields have no scouring, water accumulation, water leakage, or deep seepage. Water use efficiency has also been greatly improved. In the Jing and Wei irrigation areas, a flow rate of one cubic meter per second irrigates more than 1,000 mu of wheat fields per day and night. The irrigation efficiency of the Qinghui Canal irrigation area in Sanyuan County is as high as 1,500 mu, which is 1.6 times that of last winter. Various regions also carry out irrigation according to the specific conditions of the wheat fields. For example, more irrigation for fertile land, less irrigation for barren land; less irrigation for moist land, more irrigation for dry land; more irrigation for low groundwater levels, less or no irrigation for high groundwater levels, etc. Various regions have also greatly improved irrigation tools. Shicao Commune in Dali County created and imitated more than 180 kinds of water lifting tools. They converted water pumps into mobile pumping stations on boats, which moved around to irrigate the land, giving full play to the effectiveness of the tools. While irrigating in winter, various regions generally apply top dressing, prevent insects, and harrow in winter to increase soil fertility and seal cracks.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan - Since the beginning of winter, People's Communes in various parts of Shanxi Province have been dispatching troops and organizing professional teams to seize the winter irrigation. As of December 5, the province had winter-irrigated 3.01 million mu of land, more than four times higher than the same period last year.

Various regions generally combine winter irrigation with water conservancy construction and large-scale land landscaping, so winter irrigation work has high efficiency, fast progress, and good quality. Since the beginning of winter, more than 35,000 small-scale water conservancy projects have been started throughout the province, and 15,000 of them have been completed ahead of schedule and put into winter irrigation. These projects can expand and improve the irrigation area by more than 2.69 million mu. A 10-mile-long canal and two mechanical irrigation stations recently built by the Chengguan People's Commune in Pingyao County have irrigated more than 2,700 mu of wheat fields and winter fallow land in the past month. At the same time, due to the widespread leveling of land and large-scale landscaping, the phenomenon of large-scale flooding in winter irrigation has been prevented, greatly improving water utilization. In Wenshui County, the average water consumption per mu of 230,000 mu of high-standard landscaped cultivated land has been reduced from 136 cubic meters in the past to 56 cubic meters in winter irrigation. The amount of water that used to irrigate 30,000 mu of land can now irrigate 71,000 mu.

This newspaper reports that the current daily progress of winter irrigation in Gansu Province has reached 625,800 mu, which is an unprecedented high speed in the history of winter irrigation in Gansu. As of December 5, the province had winter-irrigated 12,527,200 mu.

Zhangye Prefecture, a large irrigation area, has been running ahead of all prefectures in the province in winter irrigation this winter. People's Communes generally adopt methods such as dividing troops by irrigation area, cooperating with each other, diverting large amounts of water, merging small amounts of water, and where the water arrives, the people arrive. They have already winter-irrigated 6,252,300 mu. The Jiuquan Municipal Party Committee further exerted the superiority of the People's Communes and made long-term plans, short-term arrangements, and mobile water use according to the characteristics of different irrigation areas. For example, in flood areas, large water diversions, flood rushes, and small water diversions were used to irrigate far away before near, improving utilization. The method of planned water supply is: more water is allocated to those with more land and more labor, and less water is allocated to those with less land and less labor, avoiding the shortcomings of uneven water distribution and waste of water.

Each county in Pingliang Prefecture adapts to local conditions, drilling wells where suitable, building dams where suitable, and repairing canals where suitable, making full use of water sources for winter irrigation.

After the Nanyang Canal, a large-scale canal that diverts water up the mountains in the Linxia area, was fully opened to traffic, the Dongxiang Autonomous County has begun large-scale winter irrigation. (Attached picture)

    抢在封冻前完成冬灌工作
    山东组织麦田管理专业队日浇达九十万亩
    河北各地加强协作近一半麦田已浇灌一遍
    陕西推广细流灌溉方法灌溉效率大大提高
    山西已经冬灌面积比去年同期增加四倍多
    甘肃根据不同灌区特点制定合理用水计划
    据新华社济南讯　山东各地正在开展麦田冬灌运动，力争在封冻前将麦田普浇一次。到9日，全省灌溉麦田已达八百六十多万亩，比去年同期增加45％。
    山东省今年冬小麦播种得又早又好，麦苗生长得超过过去任何一年。为了浇透冻前水，各地普遍组织了麦田管理专业队，全省日浇麦田达九十多万亩。齐河、蓬莱两县，根据即将封冻、任务时间紧迫的情况，麦田管理大军由原来十一万人增加到十五万多人，把水井、水库、水坑等都利用起来。蓬莱县为解决提水工具不足的问题，新安装风力水车七百多部。这两个县在三天内灌溉麦田四十六万多亩。
    为了使治水与冬灌小麦紧密结合起来，各地在兴修水利中都是边修边用，充分发挥工程效益。仅据聊城专区寿张、临清、聊城等六个县市的统计，仅引黄灌溉就新挖和整修大小渠道四万八千多条，灌溉麦田二百三十五万亩。
    据新华社天津13日电　河北省各地人民公社展开热火朝天的小麦冬灌活动。据统计，到本月5日，全省已冬浇麦田48％。气候较冷的张家口、承德地区已全部浇完。
    在人民公社党委的领导下，各地社员在冬灌中发挥了高度的共产主义协作精神，藁城县十五个公社和八百多个生产队在携手赛中，条件好的富队都主动帮穷队，先进队帮助后进队。这个县的城关、大陈、无极等六个公社，有一百零五个先进队把二百多台排灌机械拿出来支援五十多个因缺少牲口、工具浇麦进度较慢的生产队，使这些队的麦田及时进行了冬灌。安国县各社队大大发扬了把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己的共产主义风格。例如，霍庄和北徐辛庄两个生产队伙用一眼机井，霍庄社员白天帮北徐辛庄社员浇麦，晚上北徐辛庄的社员又主动帮霍庄社员干，结果两个生产队提前两天完成小麦冬浇任务。
    据新华社西安讯　陕西省大力改进灌溉方法和灌溉工具，从11月下旬开始冬灌工作以来，已灌溉一百六十余万亩。
    今年，各地在冬灌中普遍推行了细流灌溉的方法，灌溉过的麦田没有冲刷、积水、跑水和深层渗漏等现象。用水效率也大大提高。泾、渭两个灌区，一个秒公方水的流量一昼夜灌溉一千多亩麦田。三原县清惠渠灌区的灌溉效率高达一千五百亩，为去冬的一点六倍。各地还根据麦田的具体情况进行灌溉。例如地肥的多灌，地瘦的少灌；墒大的少灌，墒小的多灌；地下水位低的多灌，地下水位高的少灌或不灌等。各地还大量改进了灌溉工具。大荔县石槽公社创造和仿制了一百八十多种提水工具，他们把抽水机改装在船上，成为流动抽水机站，到处流动浇地，充分发挥了工具的效能。在冬灌的同时，各地普遍追肥、防虫和冬耱，以增加地力，封闭裂缝。
    据新华社太原讯　入冬以来，山西省各地人民公社都纷纷调兵遣将，组织专业队伍抓紧冬季灌溉。到12月5日，全省已经冬灌土地三百零一万亩，比去年同期增加了四倍多。
    各地普遍把冬灌工作和兴修水利、大搞土地园田化紧密地结合起来，所以冬季浇灌工作效率高、进度快、质量好。入冬以来，全省开工修建的三万五千多处小型水利工程，已经有一万五千处提前竣工投入冬浇，这些工程可扩大和改善灌溉面积二百六十九万多亩。平遥县城关人民公社最近建成的一条长十里的水渠和两个机械灌溉站，一个月来，已灌溉麦田和冬闲地两千七百多亩。同时，由于各地普遍平整土地，大搞园田化，防止了冬浇中大水漫灌现象，大大提高了水的利用率。文水县二十三万多亩达到高标准园田化的耕地，在冬灌中每亩平均用水量从过去的一百三十六立方米，减少到五十六立方米。过去灌溉三万亩土地的水量，现在能灌溉七万一千亩。
    本报讯　目前甘肃省冬灌日进度已到六十二万五千八百亩，这是甘肃冬灌史上空前未有的高速度。到12月5日，全省已冬灌一千二百五十二万七千二百亩。
    大型灌溉区的张掖专区，今冬冬灌一直跑在全省各专区的前边。各人民公社普遍采取按灌区分兵作战，互相协作，大水分渠，小水并渠，水到哪里人到哪里等办法，已冬灌六百二十五万二千三百亩。酒泉市市委进一步发挥了人民公社的优越性，根据不同灌区的特点，长计划，短安排，机动用水。如洪水地区，大水分灌，洪水抢灌，小水先远后近的灌，提高了利用率。计划给水的办法是：地多劳多多配水，地少劳少少配水，避免了分水不匀浪费水量的缺点。
    平凉专区各县因地制宜，宜打井的打井，宜打坝的打坝，宜修渠的修渠，充分利用水源进行冬灌。
    临夏地区引水上山的大型渠道南阳渠全线通水后，东乡族自治县已开始大规模的冬灌。（附图片）
