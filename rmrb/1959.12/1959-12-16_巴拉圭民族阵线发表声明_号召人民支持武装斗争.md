Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, December 14th: The Central Leadership Committee of the Paraguayan National Liberation United Front issued a statement today calling on the Paraguayan people to "resolutely support and assist, by all means, the patriotic detachments that are currently and will be engaged in armed struggle for national liberation."

The statement pointed out that "The heroic struggle of the Paraguayan people against the Stroessner tyrannical rule has entered the initial stage of armed uprising due to the actions of certain patriotic detachments. These patriotic detachments have strengthened the armed resistance initiated earlier by peasants in some areas of our country." The statement added, "The Paraguayan people will not cease their struggle until the current dictatorial regime and its machinery of suppression are thoroughly destroyed. This is not simply a struggle to replace personnel, but a struggle for freedom."

The statement said, "The United Front calls on all Paraguayans, belonging to all parties and holding all different ideas and beliefs, to unite like steel in the struggle against tyrannical rule, to establish committees and joint committees to organize and mobilize the people, in order to use violence to establish a democratic provisional government representing all factions in the country."

The Paraguayan National Liberation United Front was established in Uruguay in February this year, with members including the Liberal Party, the February Party, the Communist Party, democratic elements within the ruling party (National Republican Association), and Catholics.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, December 14th: The anti-dictatorial forces that crossed the border into Paraguay on the morning of the 12th continue to fight government troops in eastern and southeastern Paraguay.

Fighting is taking place in five locations within Paraguay, three of which are near Encarnación in the southeast, close to Argentina, and two of which are near the eastern border with Brazil.

According to sources from the anti-dictatorial forces, the anti-dictatorial forces have established ten bridgeheads along the Paraná River bordering Argentina and Brazil, and have occupied border towns such as Capitán Bado, Guazú, Bella Vista, and Embarcación. Railway traffic between Asunción, the capital of Paraguay, and Encarnación has been cut off.

According to the Argentine newspaper "Razón," a force of eight hundred to one thousand men, led by Major Villamayor, entered Paraguay from Brazil and began advancing towards the border villages. The newspaper said that this armed operation was led by the opposition within the ruling party (National Republican Association), headed by Méndez Fleitas.

The anti-dictatorial army's radio station called on the Paraguayan people to join the struggle against the "bloody tyranny of Stroessner and his servants." Jiménez Caballero, one of the anti-dictatorial leaders, said that the uprising movement would immediately launch land reform to destroy "Paraguay's large landholdings and the system of slavery."

The anti-dictatorial armed forces have received support from the citizens of Yegros, Uté, and Carmen del Paraná. News reports indicate that the garrisons of the three small towns of Carmen del Paraná, Uté, and Yegros have joined the ranks of the anti-dictatorial armed forces.

    巴拉圭民族阵线发表声明
    号召人民支持武装斗争
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯14日电  巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线中央领导委员会今天发表了一项声明，号召巴拉圭人民“千方百计地坚决支持和帮助现在和将来为了民族解放进行武装斗争的爱国者分队”。
    声明指出，“巴拉圭人民反对斯特罗斯纳暴政统治的英勇斗争，由于某些爱国者分队开始行动而进入了武装起义的最初阶段。这些爱国者分队壮大了我国某些地方的农民早先发起的武装反抗。”声明又说，“不彻底摧毁目前的独裁政权及其镇压机器，巴拉圭人民决不停止斗争。这不是一次简单地更换人员的斗争，而是一次争取自由的斗争。”
    声明说，“联合阵线号召属于各党派、具有各种不同思想和信仰的所有巴拉圭人，在反对暴政统治的斗争中钢铁般地团结起来，建立委员会和联合委员会来组织和动员人民，以便用暴力建立一个代表全国各派势力的民主临时政府。”
    巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线是今年2月间在乌拉圭成立的，参加的成员包括自由党、二月党、共产党、执政党（国家共和党）中的民主分子以及天主教徒。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯14日电
  12日早晨越过边境进入巴拉圭的反独裁武装继续在巴拉圭东部和东南部地区同政府军队作战。
    战斗在巴拉圭境内的五个地方进行，其中三个地方在东南部靠近阿根廷的恩卡尔纳松附近，两个地方在靠近东部的巴西边境。
    来自反独裁部队方面的消息说，反独裁部队已经在和阿根廷、巴西接壤的巴拉那河沿岸建立了十个桥头堡，占领了卡皮坦巴多、瓜苏、贝利亚比斯塔、恩巴耳塞等边境城镇。巴拉圭首都亚松森和恩卡尔纳松之间的铁路交通已经断绝。
    据阿根廷“理性报”报道，有一支八百到一千人的部队在比利亚马约尔少校领导下从巴西进入巴拉圭，开始向边境村镇挺进。这家报纸说，这个武装行动是由门德斯·弗莱斯塔为首的执政党（国家共和党）内的反对派领导的。
    反独裁军的电台号召巴拉圭人民参加反对“斯特罗斯纳和他的仆从的血腥暴政”的斗争。反独裁领导人之一希梅内斯·卡巴列罗说，起义运动将立即发动土地改革，以摧毁“巴拉圭的大地主领地和奴役制度”。
    反独裁武装部队得到耶格罗斯、乌蒂和卡门德尔普拉纳市民的支持。消息说，卡门德尔普拉纳、犹泰和耶德罗三个小镇的驻军参加了反独裁武装部队的行列。
