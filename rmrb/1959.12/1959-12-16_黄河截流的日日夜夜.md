The people's hearts are stirring! The people's blood is boiling! The rampant Yellow River flood has been forced by the dam to a mere one-meter-wide spillway. It struggles desperately, roaring! At this moment, the people fighting on the diversion construction site are even more high-spirited. The laborers transporting willow bundles are running forward one after another, and the heroes conveying stones are swiftly passing stones. Another ten minutes passed like lightning. The floodwaters rushing to escape began to lower their heads, making hoarse cries of supplication, and were finally choked by a large willow-stone pillow. It submitted, became obedient, and we were victorious! The fierce and unusual Yellow River, which had harmed the people for thousands of years, was cut off at the waist by the heroes! The river water turned its head and obediently flowed eastward under the control of the dam gates. The diversion heroes on the north and south banks had a victorious meeting on the dam! People embraced each other warmly, jumping and cheering, with tears of excited happiness in their eyes, shouting long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party! The valleys and the earth shook with it. At the foot of Huangshan Mountain, near the dam, a seventy-two-year-old man, Huang Yuqian, said meaningfully, "I have one less thing to worry about in my life, and I no longer have to worry about my descendants being harmed by the Yellow River." This time, when the Yellow River changed its course, people did not wail and run away. Instead, tens of thousands of smiling eyes watched the surging flood rolling down according to the will of the people.

人人同心
Everyone United

November 25th was a solemn day. Tens of thousands of laborers on the diversion construction site held a rally to pledge to cut off the Yellow River. "Heroes have lofty aspirations, we swear not to stop until the Yellow River is cut off." This was the oath of the heroes. When the order to wage a decisive battle against the Yellow River was given, a tense battle immediately unfolded on the dam head. Dozens of ropes as thick as fists were pulled from the shore to the pontoon boats fixed in the river. The first "zhanzi" (obstruction made of willow branches, wheat straw, stones, etc.) for the diversion was extended into the Yellow River. Among the lively and vigorous river workers, there were dozens of elderly people in their sixties, intently directing where the sorghum stalks should be laid and where the wooden stakes should be driven on the dam slope. They had been fighting the Yellow River for decades and were experienced "local experts." Here, there was an old river worker, Xue Jiuling, who had fought in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area and participated in more than thirty blocking operations. He was already seventy-eight years old this year. Each "zhanzi" took more than twenty to forty hours to put in place. But before the "zhanzi" settled on the riverbed, he never had a good sleep. Although he reluctantly returned to the work shed under the urging of the leaders, he reappeared on the dam slope with a wooden ruler in his hand after an hour or two.

Night fell, and ten thousand lights shone across the Yellow River like a giant fire dragon, illuminating the construction site as if it were daytime. The winter night wind was bitterly cold. But the heroes fighting on the dam slope almost all took off their cotton-padded coats, and their fiery hearts repelled the cold wind. Ma Cheng let wiped the sweat from his face and swung a five-foot-long large board to smooth the slope surface as flat as water. He and his brother, Ma Chengfu, were known as two good hands at the technique of smoothing the surface. They had been smoothing the surface for decades, but they had never smoothed it so quickly or with such vigor as they did today.

On the seventh day of the battle to cut off the Yellow River, dark clouds filled the sky, and the piercing cold wind made the red flag flutter. Suddenly, a torrential downpour began. The ferocious Yellow River seemed to have reinforcements and roared loudly, wanting to swallow the unfinished dam in one gulp. But the wind and rain could not scare the heroes! The twelve heroes who were guarding the pontoon boat, led by team leader Li Baofu, fought even more intensely. Twenty-four eyes were fixed on the various ropes on the boat, sometimes loosening the "zhan rope" and sometimes changing the "lian rope." Their cotton clothes and shoes were soaked through, but they said that the rain could only wet their clothes and socks, not their fiery hearts. They had been guarding the boat for five days and four nights in order to cut off the Yellow River. Qin Liansheng and Han Fanghua, who were fighting on the dam slope, seemed oblivious to the pouring rain, hammering wooden stakes into the sorghum stalks one by one with a heavy hammer. The mud on the road made it difficult to transport materials, and the dam slope urgently needed straw and soil. At this moment, Comrade Liu Xibin, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee and Deputy Commander of the Diversion Headquarters, and more than a hundred cadres appeared on the damhead position carrying large baskets of yellow soil. "Secretary Liu personally carried soil to support us," a young man on the dam slope shouted loudly. What a great encouragement this was to the heroes! This Deputy Secretary Liu had not had a good night's sleep for four days and four nights since the diversion began. Liu Yongqi, the cadre leading the laborers, had fought alongside Martyr Huang Jiguang in Shangganling and had suffered nine wounds. Today, he also insisted on fighting like other comrades. Cao Peiyun and Chen Dongxian were two admired construction site nurses. In this tense moment, they stepped through the mud, rushing among the laborers to see if anyone needed medicine, showing a high degree of concern for the workers.

In this way, the heroes completed the task of advancing six "zhanzi" ahead of schedule.

汹涌的人流
A Raging Flow of People

During the days of cutting off the Yellow River, there was a huge flow of people, day and night, flowing from the material yard to the diversion dam and from the diversion dam to the material yard. Two million eight hundred and eighty thousand catties of straw, more than eighteen thousand cubic meters of earth, and two thousand six hundred cubic meters of stone all turned into solid "zhan slopes" with the flow of this human stream. As a result, the dam became higher, the river narrower, and the Yellow River was cut off. This flow of people was the transportation army composed of 16,500 people from Liaocheng, Shouzhang, and Linqing. They were the powerful helpers of the 650 technicians fighting on the front lines of the diversion.

The technicians said well: "The comrades who transport materials are truly heroes, worthy of being good members of the people's commune." Yes, the transportation army is indeed a fierce and skilled fighting force. Regardless of wind or rain, they always provided sufficient materials, greatly increasing the efficiency of the diversion.

"Suffered from the Yellow River for many years, today we cut off the river to create happiness." This is the wish of the transportation army. For many years, the people living on both sides of the Yellow River have been harmed by this "evil dragon." In the heroic achievements of cutting off the Yellow River, who would not want to contribute all their strength! Xing Jinliang, captain of the Steel Assault Team of the Jiahe Commune in Shouzhang, said: "I remember that the Yellow River flooded my home six times, the Yellow River drowned my mother, and the Yellow River forced me to beg for food in Tianjin and Northeast China. Today, the Communist Party wants to turn the harmful river into a beneficial river. I am willing to fight the Yellow River to the end." This is the determination of a young commune member, and it is also the wish and will of 16,500 transportation warriors. They, with a speed of transporting 290,000 kilograms of straw, 380 cubic meters of stone, and more than 1,200 cubic meters of earth per day, cooperated with the technical army and cut off the ferocious Yellow River in just fourteen days.

When night had just fallen on December 8th, the Party Committee of the Diversion Headquarters suddenly issued an emergency order: the main dam was about to close, and soil compaction must immediately follow. It was stipulated that within eighteen hours, more than 1,500 cubic meters of soil and more than 200,000 catties of straw should be compacted on the dam to make the dam as stable as Mount Tai. Upon hearing this mobilization order, the transport army immediately entered the battle. The laborers who had just gotten off work, after eating dinner, carried their tools and ran to the construction site. In an instant, straw was like a forest on the dam, soil-carrying carts were like a long dragon, machines roared, and people shouted. "Make a final effort to block the Yellow River tightly!" Encouraged by the victory, people completely forgot their fatigue and worked continuously from 6:30 in the evening until dawn the next day.

一月胜过两年
One Month is Better Than Two Years

On the west side of the dam, on the Yellow River bank spanning sixteen square miles, sorghum stalks, stone blocks, willow branches, wooden stakes... were piled up like small mountains in patches and stacks. Here were stored more than 6.5 million catties of straw, more than 3 million catties of willow branches, more than 15,000 cubic meters of stone, and a large number of wooden stakes, hemp ropes, and sacks... These materials were used for the diversion.

Seeing these materials, people would think of the carts and vehicles covering the sky and the ground a dozen days ago, and the moving scenes of commune members rushing to deliver materials.

The news of the diversion attracted the hearts of millions of people like a magnet. From October 13th to November 25th, for more than a month, this section of the Yellow River bank was truly bustling with vehicles, a flowing crowd, and boats like shuttles, day and night. The people's communes mobilized a large number of transportation tools, mobilized the strongest labor force, and delivered materials to the construction site from thousands of miles away. Regardless of rain or snow, regardless of the cold night, it never stopped. Under the battle cry of "Everything for the Diversion," Chiping County mobilized the entire population and the entire party. It overfulfilled the task by 270,000 catties, completing 2.4 million catties of straw. Shouzhang County's determination was: to send as many materials as needed, to supply whatever was needed, and to arrive whenever needed. After completing the task, they also specially prepared more than 200,000 catties of reeds to be used as a supplement if there were insufficient willow branches for the diversion. The commune members of the Taochengbu Management Area of the Zhangqiu Commune were even more energetic. Upon hearing that the materials were for cutting off the Yellow River, adults and children worked together and carried 120,000 catties of sorghum stalks to the construction site in one night. The comrades in charge of the material yard at the diversion construction site said with emotion: "If it weren't for the people's commune, it would take at least two years to collect these things; but we only used more than a month!"

In cutting off the Yellow River, the broad masses of people in southwestern Shandong have done their best, and the people of Shandong Province and neighboring brother provinces have also contributed their strength. When the news of the diversion reached the Yantai Ship Equipment Factory, the workers fought day and night and manufactured 24 large iron anchors sixteen days ahead of schedule, so that the key pontoon boats and towing cable boats could stand firmly in the water, ensuring the smooth progress of the occupation work. When the news of the diversion reached Henan Province, the Henan Provincial People's Committee allocated a large wooden boat and two hundred technicians to support the project, and also opened all the sluice gates in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, reducing the flow and lowering the water level. People said that under the leadership of the Communist Party, there is nothing that cannot be done. It is truly a case of everyone united and the whole country united! (Attached picture)

    黄河截流的日日夜夜
    刘作坤　房文光
    人们的心激动着！人们的血在沸腾！猖狂的黄河洪水被拦河大坝逼得只剩下一米宽的泄水道路了。它拼命地挣扎着，咆哮着！这时，战斗在截流工地上的人们更加斗志昂扬。运送柳把的民工一个接着一个跑步前进，传送料石的英雄们在飞快地传送着石头。时间又飞也似的闪过了十分钟，夺路的黄水开始低头，发出了嘶哑的哀求声，最后被一个大柳石枕扼住了喉咙。它驯服了，老实了，我们胜利了！凶猛异常、危害人民数千年的黄河，被英雄们拦腰斩断了！河水掉过头来，通过拦河闸的控制乖乖东流。南北两岸的截流英雄们，在拦河大坝上胜利会师了！人们热烈地拥抱着，跳跃着，欢呼着，噙着激动的幸福的泪花，高喊毛主席万岁！共产党万岁！山谷和大地为之震撼。近临拦河大坝的黄山脚下一位七十二岁的老人黄玉谦意味深长地说：“我这一辈子又少了一件心事，再不担心子孙们受黄河的害了。”这次黄河改道，人们不是嚎哭逃跑，而是用数万只含笑的眼睛，望着澎湃的洪水听从人民的意志滚滚而下。
              人人同心
    11月25日，是一个庄严的日子，截流工地上的数万民工举行了腰斩黄河誓师大会。“英雄立下凌云志，不断黄河誓不休”，这就是英雄们的誓言。当向黄河决战的号令响起后，坝头上立即展开了紧张的战斗。数十根拳头粗的巨绳，从岸上扯到固定在河中的捆厢船上，截流的第一个“占子”（用柳条、麦秸、石块等制成的阻塞物）伸进了黄河。在生龙活虎的河工中，有几十名年过花甲的老人，在坝埽上聚精会神地指挥着秫秸铺到那里，木桩打到那里。他们是跟黄河斗争了几十年，是经验丰富的“土专家”。这儿，有一位转战冀鲁豫、参加堵口三十多次的老河工薛九龄，今年已经七十八岁了。每进一个“占子”，需要二十多个小时到四十多个小时。可是在“占子”没落河底以前，他从未很好地入睡过。虽然在领导人的督促下，他勉强回到工棚，但一两个小时后，他又持着木尺出现在坝埽上。
    夜幕下垂，万盏灯光好像一条巨大的火龙横跨黄河，把工地照得如同白昼。冬夜的风寒冷彻骨。但是战斗在坝埽上的英雄们几乎都脱去了棉袄，火热的心击退了寒风。马成让擦了擦脸上的汗水，抡起五尺多长的大板飞快地把埽面打得像水一般平。他和他的兄弟马成福，论打板技术称得起两把好手。他俩打了几十年的大板，可是都没有今天打的这样飞快，这样起劲。
    腰斩黄河的战斗，进行到第七天的时候，乌云布满了天空，凛冽的寒风吹的红旗呼啦啦响。霎时，哗哗的大雨下了起来。凶猛的黄河好像有了援兵一样，发出了巨大的咆哮声，想把没有筑好的拦河大坝一口吞没。但是风雨吓不倒英雄好汉！坚守在捆厢船上的十二名英雄，在组长李保福率领下，更加紧张地战斗着。二十四只眼睛紧紧盯住船上的各路用绳，他们一会儿松松“占绳”，一会儿又换换“练绳”。棉衣、鞋袜湿透了，他们却说：雨只能淋湿他们的衣袜，不能淋湿他们那颗火热的心。为了斩断黄河，他们已经在船上坚守了五天四夜了。战斗在坝埽上的秦连生和韩芳华，好像没有觉察到倾盆大雨，紧张地抡着油锤，把木桩一根根打进秫秸里。路上的泥泞，给运料带来了困难，坝埽上迫切需要秸料和土。正在这时，截流指挥部党委副书记兼副指挥刘习斌同志和一百多名干部，抬着大筐大筐的黄土出现在坝头阵地上。“刘书记亲自抬土来支援我们来了”，坝埽上一个年青小伙子大声的喊着。这对英雄们是一个多么大的鼓舞！就是这位刘副书记在截流开始后，四天四夜没有好好地睡一个觉了。带领民工的干部刘永其，曾在上甘岭和黄继光烈士并肩作过战，身负九处伤、今天他也和其他同志一样，坚持战斗。曹培云和陈东仙是两位受人赞扬的工地护士，在这紧张的时刻里，她俩踏着泥泞，奔走在民工里探看是否有人需要医药，表现了高度的对劳动者的关怀。
    英雄们就是这样提前完成了共进六个“占子”的任务。
          汹涌的人流
    在腰斩黄河的日子里，有一支巨大的人流，日日夜夜从料场流到截流大坝上，又从截流大坝流到料场上。二百八十八万斤秸料，一万八千多土方，两千六百方石料，都随着这支人流的流动，变成了一座座坚固的占埽，随着，大坝高了，河身窄了，黄河斩断了。这支人流就是聊城、寿张、临清一万六千五百人组成的运料大军，他们是战斗在截流最前线的六百五十多名技工的得力帮手。
    技工同志们说得好：“运料的同志真是英雄汉，不愧为人民公社的好社员。”是啊，运料大军确实是一支猛打善战的部队，不管风里雨里，总是把材料供应得足足的，使截流效率猛提一倍。
    “受了黄河多年苦，今日斩河创幸福。”这是运料大军的意愿。多少年来，这些生活在黄河两岸的人们，就一直受着这条“孽龙”的侵害，在腰斩黄河的英雄业迹中，谁又不想尽上自己所有的力量！寿张夹河公社钢铁突击队队长邢金良说：“我记得黄河六次淹了我的家，黄河淹死了我的娘，黄河逼着我到天津、东北去讨饭。今天共产党要把害河变利河，我愿和黄河拼到底。”这是一个青年社员的决心，也是一万六千五百个运料战士的愿望和意志。他们以日运秸料二十九万公斤、三百八十方石料、一千二百多土方的速度，仅用十四天的时间，配合技术大军，将凶猛的黄河拦腰斩断。
    当12月8日，夜刚刚降临时，截流指挥部党委忽然下了紧急命令：正坝合龙了，压土必须马上跟上去，限定在十八小时之内，将一千五百多方土、二十余万斤秸料压到坝上，叫大坝稳如泰山。运输大军听到这个动员令，马上投入了战斗，刚刚下班的民工，吃过晚饭又扛起工具跑向了工地。一霎时，大坝上秸料如森林，运土车如长龙，机器吼鸣，人声沸腾。“尽最后一把力把黄河堵得死死的！”人们在胜利的鼓舞下完全忘记了疲劳，从晚上六时半，一直干到第二天天明。一月胜过两年
    在拦河坝的西侧，纵横十六平方里的黄河岸上，高粱秸、石方、柳枝、木桩……一片片、一垛垛像小山一样。这里存放着秸料六百五十余万斤，柳枝三百余万斤，石料一万五千余方，还有大量的木桩、麻绳、麻袋……这些物料是截流用的。
    看到这些物料，人们就会想到十几天前盖天片地的大车小辆，就会想到公社社员争先恐后送料的动人场面。
    截流的消息像磁石一样地吸引着千百万人的心。从10月13日到11月25日的一个多月内，这段黄河岸上真是车水马龙，人群如流，船舶如梭，日夜不绝。人民公社出动了大量的交通用具，发动了最坚强的劳力，不远数千里把料物送到了工地，不管雨雪，不管寒夜，从来也没有停止过。茌平县在“一切为了截流”的战斗口号下，全民动员，全党动手，二百四十万斤秸料超额二十七万斤完成了任务。寿张县的决心是：要多少料送多少料，要什么供应什么，什么时候要什么时候到。他们在完成任务后，还特地准备了二十余万斤苇子，准备截流的柳枝不足时补用。张秋公社陶城埠管理区的社员劲头更足，一听是腰斩黄河的用料，大人小孩一齐动手，一个晚上把十二万斤高粱秸扛到了工地。管理截流工地料场的同志感动地说：“要不是人民公社，这些东西起码要两年才能汇集起来；可是我们才用了一个多月啊！”
    腰斩黄河，鲁西南广大人民尽到了自己的力量，山东省以及邻近兄弟省的人民也贡献了自己的力量。当截流的消息传到烟台船具厂时，工人们日夜奋战，提前十六天制造了二十四口大铁锚，使截流中带有关键性的捆厢船、拖缆船牢牢地立在水中，保证了进占工作的顺利进行。当截流的消息传到了河南省，河南省人民委员会拨来了一只大木船，二百名技术工人，支援工程进行，并且把黄河上游的水闸全部开放，使流量减少，水位降低。人们说，在共产党领导下没有办不成的事，真是众人一条心，全国一条心！（附图片）
