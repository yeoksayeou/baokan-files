Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 11th. Under the slogan "Breaking boundaries in competition, thousands of communes, ten thousand teams as one family," the people's communes and production teams in the adjacent areas of counties and special districts in Jiangsu Province are extensively carrying out a socialist labor emulation campaign and collaboration, enabling the mass movement in the border areas to unfold vigorously, just like in the central areas. This has effectively promoted production in the border areas.

The Xinba Commune in the border area of Nantong County and the Yonggan Commune in the border area of Rugao County are competitors. The Xinba Commune applied different fertilizers to the wheat seedlings according to their condition, and the third-class seedlings improved rapidly. After visiting the Xinba Commune, the Yonggan Commune not only learned the topdressing techniques of the Xinba Commune, but also introduced their measures for loosening the soil and protecting the wheat seedlings to survive the winter safely to the Xinba Commune. As a result, the two communes jointly improved the level of wheat field management. After the Nanping and Tianzhuang Communes in Haian County and the Daizhuang Commune in Rugao County launched a competition, they jointly organized inspection teams to regularly inspect and evaluate production work. In the inspection and evaluation of wheat field management, the Daizhuang Commune learned from the experience of the Nanping and Tianzhuang Communes, mobilized commune members to dig drainage ditches and accumulate fertilizer in the wheat fields, and applied a dose of quick-acting fertilizer to 4,000 mu of fertilizer-deficient wheat fields, significantly improving the quality of wheat field management.

The commune and team competitions in the border areas of Jiangsu developed during the Great Leap Forward last year. However, last year's competitions were generally covert, with secret visits and learning. After communization, the collectivist ideology of cadres and masses in the border areas continued to improve, and the friendship between adjacent communes and teams gradually deepened. During the spring plowing production this year, many communes and production teams in the border areas transformed the original covert competitions into overt competitions, and gradually developed from simple competition to both helping and competing, from competitions between communes and teams on the borders of the same county to competitions between counties and special districts. In the competition, many adjacent counties and special districts also launched activities to exchange goods and support each other based on the principle of equivalent exchange. Many communes and teams kept the difficulties for themselves and provided convenience to others, helping their competitors overcome difficulties. For example, the Tuanjie Brigade of the Guben Commune in Haian County and the Liangsi Brigade of the Fuan Commune in Dongtai County are competitors. During the autumn drought resistance struggle, most of the 1,300 mu of rice in the Tuanjie Brigade were cut off from water sources, and the rice seedlings gradually turned from yellow to withered. At this critical moment, the cadres and members of the Liangsi Brigade took the initiative to dig open the Yangjiaba dam in their territory and released water to the Tuanjie Brigade, saving more than 1,000 mu of rice that was about to dry up. Thanks to close collaboration and mutual support, the two brigades achieved a bumper harvest of autumn crops, and the total autumn grain output increased by more than 20% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

Before and after the autumn harvest and planting this year, Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province conscientiously summarized the achievements and experiences of carrying out competition and collaboration in the border areas. They generally believed that the benefits of this kind of competition and collaboration are: it greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of cadres and masses in the border areas, promoted production development, and further changed the production outlook of the border areas; it cultivated the communist ideology of cadres and masses, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths, supporting each other in times of difficulty, and advancing together; it strengthened the Party's leadership over the border areas, enabling the mass movement in the border areas to also develop vigorously. After this summary, the competition in the border areas has been further developed. Twenty-one communes in Rugao County are competing with thirteen communes in five counties, including Rudong, Nantong, Haian, Taixing, and Jingjiang; seventeen communes and ninety-five brigades in Dongtai County participated in the border area competition. Many border communes and teams jointly formed competition committees, fixed full-time personnel to work, timely collected information, strengthened information liaison between borders, and regularly researched and discussed the situation of border competition, ensuring the healthy development of the competition movement in the border areas.

### 冲破边界比武　千社万队一家  江苏边界地区相互竞赛协作推动生产发展

    冲破边界比武　千社万队一家
    江苏边界地区相互竞赛协作推动生产发展
    各社队之间的竞赛协作，已经由暗比暗赛发展为明比明赛，由单纯的竞赛发展为既帮又赛，由本县边界社队的竞赛，发展到县与县、专区与专区的边界竞赛。
    新华社南京11日电　江苏省县与县、专区与专区毗邻地区的各人民公社和生产队，在“冲破边界比武，千社万队一家”的口号下，广泛进行社会主义劳动大竞赛、大协作，使边界地区的群众运动，和中心地区一样蓬勃展开。有效地促进了边界地区的生产。
    南通县边界地区的新坝公社和如皋县边界地区的勇敢公社是竞赛对手，新坝公社根据不同的麦苗追施了不同的肥料，三类苗升级很快。勇敢公社到新坝公社参观后，一面学习新坝公社的追肥技术，一面把他们麦田松土和保护麦苗安全过冬的措施介绍给新坝公社，结果，两个公社共同提高了麦田管理水平。海安县南屏、田庄两个公社和如皋县戴庄公社开展竞赛以后，联合组织检查组，定期检查评比生产工作。在麦田管理的检查评比中，戴庄公社学习了南屏、田庄两个公社的经验，动员社员在麦田中突击开挖排水沟和积肥，在四千亩缺肥的麦田里追施了一次速效肥料，使麦田管理质量显著提高。
    江苏各地边界地区的社、队竞赛，是在去年大跃进中发展起来的。但去年一般是暗比暗赛，暗里参观学习。公社化以后，边界地区干部和群众的集体主义思想不断提高，毗邻社队间的友谊逐步加深，今年春耕生产中，许多边界地区的公社和生产队便把原来的暗比暗赛发展为明比明赛，并且逐步由单纯的竞赛发展为既帮又赛，由本县边界的社、队竞赛发展到县与县、专区与专区的边界竞赛。在竞赛中，很多毗邻县、专区的社、队还根据等价交换的原则，展开了互通有无，互相支援的活动。许多社队把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，帮助竞赛对方战胜困难。例如，海安县古贲公社团结大队和东台县富安公社梁四大队是竞赛对手，在秋季抗旱斗争中，团结大队一千三百多亩水稻大部分断绝水源，稻苗逐渐由黄变枯，就在这个紧要关头，梁四大队的干部和社员主动地挖开自己境内的杨家坝，放水给团结大队，使这个大队的一千多亩即将干枯的稻子得到挽救。这两个大队由于紧密协作，互相支援，秋熟作物都获得了丰收，秋季粮食总产量都比大跃进的1958年增产二成以上。
    今年秋收秋种前后，江苏省各级党委认真地总结了边界地区开展竞赛协作的成绩和经验，普遍认为，这种竞赛协作的好处是：大大激发了边界地区干部和群众的干劲，促进了生产发展，进一步改变了边界地区的生产面貌；培养了干部群众的共产主义思想，互相帮助，取长补短，患难相扶，共同跃进；加强了党对边界地区的领导，使边界地区的群众运动也蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。经过这次总结后，各边界地区的竞赛又有了进一步的发展。如皋县有二十一个公社和如东、南通、海安、泰兴、靖江等五个县的十三个公社竞赛；东台县有十七个公社、九十五个大队参加了边界地区竞赛。许多边界的社、队联合组成竞赛委员会，固定专人办公，及时汇集情况，加强边界之间的情报联系，经常地研究和讨论边界竞赛的情况，保证了边界地区的竞赛运动健康发展。
