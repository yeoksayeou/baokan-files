Weishan Lake's Abundant Fish Herald a Bumper Harvest

(Our report) Weishan County's fishermen in Shandong Province, building upon their autumn catches, are vigorously carrying out winter fishing activities. As of the end of November, the county has produced more than 52.6 million jin of fish, an increase of 45.8% over the same period last year. The daily fish production here has also increased from 200,000 jin in mid-November to 260,000 jin, breaking the historical daily production record. This year, the water conditions in Weishan Lake are good, so there are more carp, accounting for more than 40% of the fish caught. For example, the third team of the Gujing Production Team of the Chenzhuang Management Area of the Luqiao Commune caught more than 1,000 jin of fish on November 30, of which 80% were carp.

This year, large fish have also been continuously discovered in Weishan Lake. The Aihu Production Team of the Mingyang Management Area of the Mingyang Commune caught a "Huang Jiang Gan" fish using a hook, weighing 61.8 jin. According to veteran fishermen, the repeated catches of large fish in Weishan Lake this year are a sign of a bumper fish harvest this winter.

    微山湖大鱼兆丰收
    本报讯　山东微山县的渔民在秋季捕捞的基础上，大力开展冬季捕鱼活动。截至11月底，全县已产鱼五千二百多万斤，产量比去年同期增加45.8％。这里捕鱼的日产量也由11月中旬的二十万斤，提高到二十六万斤，打破历史日产纪录。今年微山湖的水势好，因此鲤鱼较多，占捕捞鱼的40％多。如鲁桥公社陈庄管理区古井生产队三小队在11月30日捕的一千多斤鱼中，有80％是鲤鱼。
    今年微山湖还不断发现大鱼。明阳公社明阳管理区爱湖生产队用座钩捕获一条“黄坚杆”鱼，体重六十一斤八两。据老渔民说，今年微山湖一再捞到大鱼是今冬鱼产大丰收的预兆。
