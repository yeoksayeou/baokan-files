Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 19th: This year, the Harbin Bearing Factory achieved a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in production. As of December 15th, the entire factory had comprehensively overfulfilled this year's national plan and all contract tasks. Compared with this year's national plan: output exceeded by 15%, total output value exceeded by 33%, labor productivity increased by 14%, product cost reduced by 1.3%, variety completion reached 100%, profit exceeded by 12%, and product quality met national standards. Compared with 1958, this year's output of precision and cutting-edge products increased by 31 times, and the output of large-sized products increased by 3.5 times, effectively supporting the needs of more than 2,200 industrial and mining enterprises across the country.

At the beginning of this year, a few cadres in the Harbin Bearing Factory had complacency and relaxation, believing that last year's output had more than doubled, the production potential had been almost fully tapped, and further efforts would not have much effect. In response to this thinking, the factory Party committee promptly mobilized the masses to launch debates and criticisms, further implemented the general line, and thus achieved a "full house red" in the first quarter four days ahead of schedule. In May, when the factory mobilized the masses to continue improving product quality, some cadres again put forward arguments such as "new apprentices accounting for a large proportion" and "good quality and saving cannot be achieved with high speed and quantity." The factory Party committee used the typical facts of the punching group in the steel ball workshop, where apprentices accounted for half of the workforce but achieved high-quality and high-yield production every month, to educate all employees and criticize the erroneous thinking of opposing high speed and quantity with good quality and saving. The entire factory quickly formed a competition movement centered on "high quality, high yield," which made production and quality both leap forward, and the product qualification rate increased from 91.6% in the past to 97.5%.

In order to ensure the early completion of the annual national plan, since entering the fourth quarter, the factory Party committee has mobilized all employees to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. A new situation has emerged in every workshop, where everyone offers ideas and treasures, and everyone competes to take "pillboxes." In the past month or so alone, the entire factory has put forward more than 34,000 technical innovation proposals, implemented more than 8,800, and summarized and promoted more than 3,500 advanced experiences, respectively increasing production efficiency by 30% to 200 times.

While continuously strengthening political and ideological leadership, this factory has also systematically strengthened enterprise management this year. After May, the entire factory elected machine leaders on each machine tool, responsible for the comprehensive completion of the plan and related organizational work for the three shifts on their respective machine tools, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of workers to participate in production management. In the month when machine leaders were established, the efficiency of more than 200 machine tools doubled, greatly increasing the output of bearings. In terms of enterprise management system, the factory closely focused on the three links of production scheduling, technical management, and economic accounting, and implemented "three combinations" at every level and in every matter, closely combining management work with the mass technical innovation movement.

In order to enable leaders at all levels to grasp key issues, the factory also established a daily reporting and analysis system for indicators such as variety, output, total output value, and quality, which was handled by each functional department to the end, reported to relevant leaders, so that everyone at all levels always had a clear understanding in their minds, always maintained a clear head, and achieved orderliness in the mass movement.

### 时时刻刻鼓干劲　人人献策搞革新  哈尔滨轴承厂提前完成年计划

    时时刻刻鼓干劲　人人献策搞革新
    哈尔滨轴承厂提前完成年计划
    新华社哈尔滨19日电　哈尔滨轴承厂今年生产获得了全面持续跃进。到12月15日止，全厂已经全面超额完成了今年的国家计划及一切合同任务。同今年的国家计划相比：产量超额15％，总产值超额33％，劳动生产率提高14％，产品成本降低1.3％，品种完成100％，利润超额12％，产品质量合乎国家标准。同1958年相比：今年的精密尖端产品产量猛增三十一倍，大型产品产量增加三点五倍，有力地支援了全国二千二百多个工矿企业单位的需要。
    今年初，哈尔滨轴承厂曾有少数干部产生自满、松劲情绪，认为去年产量翻了一倍半，生产潜力已经挖得差不多，再使劲效果也不大了。针对这种思想，工厂党委及时发动群众展开了辩论和批判，进一步贯彻了总路线，因而提前四天实现了首季满堂红。5月份，在工厂发动群众继续提高产品质量时，部分干部又出现了“新徒工占一大半”、“要好省就不能多快”等论调，工厂党委以钢球车间冲压小组徒工占半数、月月优质高产的典型事实，向全厂职工进行了教育，批判了把多快和好省对立起来的错误思想，全厂迅速形成了以“优质、高产”为中心的竞赛运动，使产量、质量双双跃进，产品合格率由过去的91.6％提高到97.5％。
    为了保证提前完成全年国家计划，进入第四季度以来，工厂党委发动全厂职工大搞技术革新和技术革命，各个车间都出现了人人献策、献宝，个个争拿“碉堡”的新局面。仅在最近一个多月内，全厂就提出了三万四千多项技术革新建议，实现了八千八百多项，总结推广了三千五百多项先进经验，分别使生产效率提高30％至二百倍。
    在不断加强政治思想领导的同时，今年这个厂还系统地加强了企业的管理工作。5月份后，全厂在每个机台上选举了机台长，负责本机台三个班次全面完成计划及有关组织工作，大大发挥了工人参加生产管理的积极性。在建立机台长的当月，就有二百多台机台的效率提高了一倍，使轴承产量大大增加。在企业管理制度方面，这个厂紧紧抓住了生产调度、技术管理、经济核算三个环节，实行层层事事“三结合”，把管理工作和群众性的技术革新运动紧紧结合起来。
    为了使各级领导能够抓住关键问题，工厂还建立了品种、产量、总产值、质量等指标的逐日日报和分析的制度，由各职能科一条线抓到底，向有关领导汇报，因此使得上下心中随时有数，经常保持头脑清醒，在群众运动中做到忙而不乱。
