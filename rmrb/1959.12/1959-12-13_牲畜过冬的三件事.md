	Three Things for Livestock to Survive the Winter

	Protecting livestock through the winter is a very important task for developing livestock production. Doing this well can not only consolidate the achievements of the great development of livestock over the past year, but also have a tremendous impact on the continued leap forward in livestock production next year, the development of agricultural production, and the improvement of people's lives. The three most important things for livestock to safely survive the winter are: to ensure they are fed, kept warm, and do not contract epidemics. To ensure livestock are fed, one should start from two aspects: preparing sufficient feed and using this feed well. According to investigations by relevant departments, this year, whether in pastoral or agricultural areas, sufficient attention has been paid to winter feed for livestock, and most areas have prepared enough feed. However, there are also a few areas where, either due to relatively serious natural disasters such as floods and droughts that have affected crop yields, or due to insufficient attention and late action, the amount of winter feed prepared is insufficient or of poor quality. These areas must seize the time, take effective measures, catch up, and be sure to properly solve the feed problem. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the feed must be used well to achieve the goal of being fed well. In the past, some areas often used feed loosely at the beginning and tightly at the end. This practice of being full for a while and hungry for a while, good for a while and bad for a while, does not allow livestock to grow strong and fat. This year, all regions should strengthen the planning of feed use. With sufficient feed and strengthened planning for feed use, the problem of ensuring livestock are fed will be basically solved. However, to achieve the requirement of ensuring livestock are fed well, attention must also be paid to the preparation and processing of feed. Most of the feed used in winter is dry-stored crop stalks and vines with hard textures; when feeding these feeds, appropriate processing must be carried out to achieve better fattening results. The saying "chop grass into three pieces, even without feed, it will gain fat" illustrates this principle. This year, more regions have adopted more detailed methods to process roughage, such as chopping, grinding, fermenting, and cooking. This practice of feeding roughage finely is worthy of universal promotion.

	Keeping warm is a very important issue for livestock to safely survive the winter, especially in the cold north. This year, a new situation has emerged in terms of keeping warm: not only are there many livestock and large herds in pastoral areas, but also, due to communization and collective raising, livestock in agricultural areas are also in herds. Herds of livestock require larger pens for keeping warm. On the surface, building larger pens may seem difficult, but precisely because the pens are larger, the number is relatively reduced, which provides favorable conditions for solving the pen problem. Some areas have slightly repaired and renovated old pens, or used old houses and vacant rooms, as well as utilizing mountain caves, etc., and the pen problem has been solved relatively smoothly. Many places have also created many good ways to save money and materials when solving the winter pen problem. The digging and repairing of semi-underground warm pigsties, beam-less pigsties, etc. in some areas of Jilin and other provinces are a noteworthy creation in solving the problem of winter pens for livestock.

	Winter and spring are seasons when livestock epidemics are prevalent. The prevalence of livestock epidemics often leads to a large number of livestock deaths. In the case of collective feeding, if livestock epidemics spread, the harm will be even greater. We must do a good job in winter epidemic prevention. For winter epidemics such as swine fever and bovine pleuropneumonia, China has preventive vaccines. All people's communes and livestock farms should universally vaccinate livestock. By doing a good job in preventing livestock epidemics, we can ensure that livestock are not attacked by diseases in winter and spring, and can safely and healthily survive the winter.

    牲畜过冬的三件事
    保护牲畜过冬是发展畜牧业生产上一件很重要的事情。这件工作做得好，不仅可以巩固一年来牲畜大发展的成果，而且对明年畜牧业继续跃进，对发展农业生产以及改善人民生活，都有十分巨大的关系。牲畜安全过冬，最重要的三件事是：让牲畜吃饱、住的暖和不发生疫病。要做到让牲畜吃饱，应该从两方面入手，就是准备下足够的饲料和很好地使用这些饲料。根据有关部门调查，今年全国无论是牧区还是农业区，对牲畜过冬饲料都十分重视，绝大部分地区都准备下了足够的饲料。但是也有少数地区或者由于遭受比较严重的水旱等自然灾害，农作物的收成受到一定的影响；或者由于重视不够和动手较晚，过冬饲料还准备得数量不足或质量较差。这些地区一定要抓紧时间，采取有效措施，迎头赶上，务必把饲料问题妥善解决。这是一方面。另一方面，还要把饲料用好，才能达到吃饱吃好的目的。过去，有些地区在使用饲料上往往是前松后紧，这种饱一阵饥一阵，好一阵坏一阵的作法，牲畜是不能长得肥壮的。今年各地应该加强饲料使用的计划性。有了充足的饲料，加强了对饲料使用的计划性，使牲畜吃饱的问题就基本解决了。但要达到让牲畜吃好的要求，还必须注意饲料的调制和加工。冬季喂用的饲料，大部分是干储的质地较硬的作物秸秆藤蔓；喂用这些饲料，一定要进行适当的加工，才能收到较好的肥育效果。农谚“寸草铡三刀，无料也上膘”，就是这个道理。今年已有更多的地区，采用了比较细致的办法来处理粗饲料，如切碎、磨碎、发酵、煮熟等等。这种粗料细喂的作法，是值得普遍提倡的。
    保暖是牲畜安全过冬的一个很重要的问题，在寒冷的北方尤为重要。今年在保暖问题上出现了一个新情况：不仅牧区是畜多群大，同时，由于公社化和集体饲养，农业区牲畜也成群了。成群的牲畜保暖需要较大的栏圈。表面看起来，要修建较大的栏圈似乎是一个困难，但是正因栏圈较大，在数量上就相对减少，这又提供了解决栏圈的有利条件。有些地区对旧栏圈略加修理改造，或利用旧房闲屋，以及利用山洞等，栏圈问题都比较顺利地解决了。有不少地方在解决冬季栏圈问题时，还创造了很多省钱省料的好办法。吉林等省的一些地区挖修半地下保暖猪圈、无梁猪圈等，就是在解决牲畜过冬栏圈方面的一个很值得重视的创造。
    冬春是畜疫流行的季节。畜疫的流行，往往给家畜带来大量的死亡。在集体饲养的情况下，如果畜疫蔓延开来，为害就会更大。我们必须把冬季的防疫工作作好。冬季流行的畜疫猪瘟、牛肺疫等等，我国都有了预防疫苗。各人民公社和畜牧场应该普遍地给家畜接种疫苗。做好了畜疫的预防工作，才能保证牲畜在冬春不受疫病的侵袭，安全健壮的过冬。
