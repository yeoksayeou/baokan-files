The Haizhou Open-Pit Mine in Fuxin City, Liaoning Province, by November 28th, had excellently completed its annual coal mining plan thirty-three days ahead of schedule and exceeding it by 6,096 tons. This represents a 19% increase over the total coal production of 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward. The total value of production and profits submitted to the state also exceeded the annual state plan. Overall efficiency increased by 10.6% compared to the state plan; raw coal ash content was reduced by 1.55% compared to the state plan; and raw coal costs were reduced by 5.11% compared to the state plan. This demonstrates an outstanding comprehensive leap forward in high yield, high quality, high efficiency, and low cost.

At the beginning of this year, the mine's Party committee adopted the "three exchanges" (exchanging the situation, exchanging tasks, exchanging methods) and "four greats" (great mobilization, great comparison, great inspection, great summarization) methods to boost the enthusiasm of the workers and launched a coal-grabbing campaign "with steel as the key link and coal guaranteeing the key link". Later, following the central government's instructions, they combated right-leaning tendencies, boosted morale, and deeply carried out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In August, the mine suffered the most severe rainstorm since its opening, and it was in a semi-shutdown state in the first ten days of the month. Under the slogan of "fighting rainy days, seizing sunny days, small rain does not affect, big rain affects less, declare war on God", all the mine workers, through hard work and struggle, not only made up for the coal production shortfall in the first ten days of the month but also exceeded the task. Since September, they have created a new situation of continuous daily red and monthly all-round red production for three consecutive months. The mine's workers vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. By the end of October, more than 2,000 technical innovation proposals had been realized, greatly improving production efficiency. In terms of large-area high yield, 21 electric shovels in the mine achieved the requirements for large-area high yield, and the inclined shaft achieved 10,000 tons of ore in both September and October. The mine also vigorously carried out road-mine collaboration with the railway department and launched a mass car loading campaign, reducing the loading time from 311 minutes to 97 minutes, creating an advanced record of 4.2 hours for one transport operation, and winning the red flag of road-mine collaboration from the Ministry of Coal and the Ministry of Railways.

While vigorously grasping coal mining, the mine also tightly grasped production preparation work. In addition to continuously engaging in high-yield stripping and tunneling, it also adopted a series of measures such as "loading one more scoop" and "short-distance spoil lines" to continuously improve stripping production. By the end of October, stripping production increased by 12% compared to the same period last year, and tunneling increased by 29%.

The mine also conscientiously implemented the policy of "walking on two legs". In response to the inability of large-scale mechanized coal mining to mine "triangular coal" and "thin coal seams," it established specialized manual coal picking teams in the mining and tunneling areas, spoil areas, and coal preparation plants, and carried out coal picking and coke screening in locations where underground electric picks could not be used and in various culverts. The coal produced by the whole mine using this method is equivalent to the output of two large inclined shafts with an annual output of 600,000 tons.

### 海州露天矿全面完成年计划  原煤产量比1958年全年产量增长19％

    海州露天矿全面完成年计划
    原煤产量比1958年全年产量增长19％
    本报讯　辽宁省阜新市海州露天矿到11月28日止，已经提前三十三天并且超额六千零九十六吨，出色地完成了全年采煤计划，比特大跃进的1958年的全年产煤量还增长了19％。生产总值，上缴利润也都超额完成了全年国家计划；全员效率比国家计划提高了10.6％；原煤灰分比国家计划降低1.55％；原煤成本比国家计划降低5.11％。这就出色地实现了高产、优质、高效率、低成本的全面跃进。
    今年年初，这个矿的党委就采取三交（交形势、交任务、交方法）、四大（大动员、大评比、大检查、大总结）的方法，鼓足职工的干劲，掀起了“以钢为纲，以煤保纲”的夺煤大战。后来，又根据中央指示，反右倾，鼓干劲，深入开展了增产节约运动。8月份，这个矿遭受了开矿以来的特大暴雨的灾害，上旬处于半停产状态。全矿职工在“战雨天，抢晴天，小雨不影响，大雨少影响，向老天爷宣战”的口号下，经过努力奋战，不但补上了上旬欠产的煤炭，还超额完成了任务。9月份以来，更创造了连续三个月生产日日红、月月满堂红的新局面。这个矿的职工大搞技术革新和技术革命。到10月底，已经实现的技术革新建议已有两千多项，大大提高了生产效率。在大面积高产方面，全矿有二十一台电铲实现了大面积高产的要求，斜井在9、10两月份都实现了万吨矿。这个矿还同铁路部门大搞路矿协作，大搞群众装车运动，使装车时间由三百一十一分缩短到九十七分，创造了运输一次作业时间四点二小时的先进纪录，获得煤炭部、铁道部路矿协作的红旗。
    这个矿在大抓采煤的同时，紧紧地抓住了生产准备工作。除不断地大闹剥离、掘进高产外，还采取了“多装一勺”、“近距离排土线”等一系列的措施，不断地提高了剥离产量。到10月底止，剥离产量比去年同期提高了12％，掘进提高了29％。
    这个矿还认真贯彻执行了“两条腿走路”的方针，根据大型机械化采煤不能采“三角煤”、“薄煤层”等情况，分别在采掘场、排土场、选煤厂等成立了专业人工拣煤队，分别在坑下电镐不能采的地点和各?子道进行拣煤和筛焦。全矿采取这样的办法生产的煤炭，相当于年产六十万吨的两对大型斜井的产量。
