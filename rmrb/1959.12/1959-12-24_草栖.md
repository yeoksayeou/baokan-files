　　Grass habitat, also known as shrimp silk or goldfish vegetable, is a perennial aquatic plant that grows year-round. Grass habitat grows rapidly in warm weather, with the most vigorous growth from June to August, and less growth in winter. It can be chopped up, cooked, and mixed with other feed to feed pigs, or it can be fed fresh. (Picture attached)
