    Several Questions on the History of Chinese Astronomy
    Xi Zezong
    The Relationship Between Production Needs and the Development of Astronomy
    Astronomy is a natural science, a crystallization of knowledge gained by mankind in the struggle against nature during production practice. The Chinese nation first lived in the Yellow River basin, making a living by nomadic herding. At that time, in order to identify the direction of travel on the vast grasslands, they first recognized the Big Dipper. At the same time, they also discovered the connection between the arrival of cold and heat throughout the year and the different constellations seen in the southern sky at dusk. The Book of Documents says: "When the day is at its midpoint, the star Bird, to mark mid-spring"; "When the day is long, the star Fire, to mark mid-summer"; "When the night is at its midpoint, the star Void, to mark mid-autumn"; "When the day is short, the star Pleiades, to mark mid-winter." The "day at its midpoint," "day is long," "night at its midpoint," and "day is short" here are the later vernal equinox, summer solstice, autumnal equinox, and winter solstice, which are the four most basic solar terms of the year. Later, in order to adapt to the needs of agricultural production, these four solar terms were gradually developed into the twenty-four solar terms. The complete names of the twenty-four solar terms first appeared in the "Huainanzi" in the early Han Dynasty. China's twenty-four solar terms are entirely for agricultural service and were formed in the development of agriculture. The development of Chinese astronomy in the early stage due to agricultural needs is one aspect. On the other hand, the long-term stagnation in agricultural society, without experiencing the industrial revolution and industrialization, also hindered the development of astronomy. Because for the arrangement of agricultural affairs, a difference of a few days does not matter. However, industrial measurements require a very high degree of time accuracy. For example, after liberation, in order to establish industrial bases and geological explorations everywhere, geodetic surveying work was vigorously carried out; in the past ten years, the main task of astronomy in our country has been to improve the accuracy of time observation to two thousandths of a second to meet the needs of geodetic surveying work. This task was completed in 1958.
    The Relationship Between Practice and Theory in Ancient Astronomy
    Calendar work was the main work of ancient Chinese astronomy. The characteristic of ancient Chinese calendars is to place the conjunction of the sun and moon on the first day of each month and the winter solstice in November. However, the tropical year (365.2422 days) cannot be evenly divided by the synodic month (29.5306 days), and practically a month or a year cannot have a decimal fraction of a day. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust by cutting off the excess and supplementing the deficiency, using the method of leap months. Whether the leap month is properly inserted and whether the conjunction is exactly on the first day must be verified by observation. However, the conjunction is invisible and can only be seen during a solar eclipse. Therefore, it is necessary to predict solar eclipses in advance in order to observe them at the time. Therefore, the calculation of solar eclipses and the arrangement of leap months are the two main components of the calendars of past dynasties. Around the end of the Spring and Autumn Period, it was known, based on long-term observation data, that seven leap months should be inserted in nineteen years. In the early Han Dynasty, it was known that up to twenty-three solar and lunar eclipses could occur in one hundred and thirty-five months. These two rough cycles allowed people to theoretically calculate conjunctions and solar eclipses from the Han Dynasty onwards. If the calculation results differed greatly from the observation results, calendar reforms would have to be carried out. From this, we can see the relationship of theoretical dependence on practice: the foundation of theory is practice, which in turn serves practice and is also tested by practice. In this way, practice, theory, re-practice, and re-theory, circulating back and forth, gradually improved the level of Chinese calendars and solar eclipse calculations. The progress of improvement can be illustrated by Xu Guangqi's statistics in the late Ming Dynasty: "From the Han to the Sui Dynasties, there were a total of 293 solar eclipses, and 77 occurred on the last day of the month (accounting for 26%), 3 on the day before the last day, and 3 on the second day of the month. It was so sparse. From the Tang to the Five Dynasties, there were a total of 110, with 1 on the last day, 1 on the second day, and 1 on the third day. It was slightly denser. During the Song Dynasty, there were a total of 148, with no eclipses on the last day, which was even denser; there were still 13 cases of predicting an eclipse but it did not occur. During the Yuan Dynasty, there were a total of 45, also with no eclipses on the last day, which was even denser; there was still 1 case of predicting an eclipse but it did not occur, 1 case of an eclipse occurring but not being predicted, and 1 case of a night eclipse being recorded as a daytime eclipse; as for the advance or delay of the time, by three or four quarters, it was already happening at that time. We still follow it today, how can we avoid this?… From the Han Dynasty to today, for 1,500 years, there have been only 13 calendar systems. It is a matter of comparing the merits and demerits over several hundred years, not something that one person's thoughts and efforts can achieve." (Xu Wending Gong Ji, Volume 4, page 70). Here, Xu Guangqi not only explained the process of the gradual accuracy of our country's calendar, but also explained that the progress of science cannot be achieved by the power of one person, but by the long-term labor of countless people.
    The Significance of Astronomers' Philosophical Thoughts and Political Attitudes to the Development of Astronomy
    In a class society, everyone belongs to a certain class, and the so-called "transcendence" is just the deception of the reactionary class. Ancient Chinese astronomers basically belonged to the ruling class intellectuals and served their own class. However, their work could spontaneously produce materialism. Therefore, the thoughts of ancient astronomers mostly had both idealist and materialist components. All astronomers with greater achievements had more materialist components in their thinking and were more progressive politically. Take Zhang Heng, the greatest astronomer in ancient China, for example. When he was young, he wrote "Rhapsody on the Two Capitals," satirizing the Han Dynasty, telling them not to be dizzy with victory and live extravagant and boring lives; at the same time, he strictly demanded of himself "not to worry about the lack of dignity of the position, but to worry about the lack of lofty virtue; not to be ashamed of the lack of generous salary, but to be ashamed of the lack of broad knowledge," believing that fame and fortune are "obtained by fate, and seeking them is useless." In terms of philosophical thought, he even offended the imperial laws and regulations and wrote to the emperor requesting a ban on the idealist "prognostication studies" that were popular throughout the country at that time. Obviously, Zhang Heng's achievements in astronomy are inseparable from his progressive ideas. Take Shen Kuo of the Song Dynasty as another example. He politically supported Wang Anshi's reform and innovation, and in terms of learning methods, he was able to implement the mass line and the spirit of seeking truth from facts through experimentation. He said: "Skills, instruments, sizes, dimensions, black, yellow, azure, and red, how can they all come from sages; all craftsmen, officials, people in the market, fields, and villages participate in it," so he wrote "Dream Pool Essays," extensively collecting the creations and inventions of the working people and compiling a scientific masterpiece. Among them, there are many astronomical insights that are still novel even today. For example, he advocated "directly taking the day of the Beginning of Spring as the first day of the first month of spring, the Awakening of Insects as the first day of the second month of spring, with months ending at thirty-one days for large months and thirty days for small months; every year ends evenly, with no leap months forever." This is the most thorough solar calendar and is quite superior. From this, it can be seen that a scientist is most creative when combined with the working people.
    Contradictions and Struggles in the Development of Astronomy
    Astronomy itself has a spontaneous materialistic nature. Astronomers must have a materialistic ideology prevail in order to achieve something. But this is not to say that there are no idealist components in the development of astronomy. Due to historical limitations, astronomers throughout history have not consciously studied dialectical materialism, and they often make one-sided mistakes in the process of cognition. As Lenin said: "Man's knowledge is not a straight line (nor does it proceed along a straight line), but infinitely approximates a series of circles, approximates a spiral curve. Any segment, fragment, or small section of this curve can be transformed (one-sidedly transformed) into an independent and complete straight line, and this straight line can lead people (if they only see the trees and not the forest) into the mud pit, into clericalism" (Lenin: "Philosophical Notebooks," Chinese translation, page 365). Therefore, what is recognized and the theories formed at a certain level of practice will, after a period of time, be found to have shortcomings or even be completely wrong by new practices. This requires new concepts and theories to modify, supplement, or replace the old concepts and theories. In the process of modification, supplementation, and replacement, some people with one-sided understanding will inevitably oppose it, thus forming a struggle between progress and conservatism, constituting one aspect of the struggle between materialism and idealism. These kinds of contradictions and struggles are unavoidable in the development of astronomy. Astronomy develops through them. There is another reason that can cover astronomy with a layer of idealism, that is, the ruling class and its intellectuals consciously distort some of the achievements of astronomy or make idealist interpretations in order to achieve certain political goals. For astronomy itself, this is an external addition, which inevitably leads to the resistance of astronomers' spontaneous materialism, thus forming another aspect of the struggle between materialism and idealism. This type of contradiction hinders the development of astronomy and belongs to the category of history. These two types of contradictions are often related and influence each other. However, when analyzing specific problems, we can still see which one is the main contradiction. In the history of astronomy in our country, there are many examples belonging to the former type of contradiction, such as the debate on the method of inserting leap months from the first year of Duke Wen of Lu in the Spring and Autumn Period (626 BC) to the first year of Taichu in the Han Dynasty (104 BC), the debate between the Hun Tian and Gai Tian theories that began in the Han Dynasty, and the debate between Ping Shuo and Ding Shuo from He Chengtian of the Liu Song Dynasty (443 AD) to Guo Shoujing of the Yuan Dynasty (1280 AD). These debates lasted for a long time, with twists and turns in the middle, but ultimately the theories and methods that were more in line with objective facts prevailed. Regarding the latter, we can take the "Three Systems Calendar" as an example. Liu Xin, in order to support Wang Mang's reform and system change in the name of antiquity, attached the Yi Jing's commentaries to the "Taichu Calendar" based on observation and wrote the "Three Systems Calendar." We do not deny that the Three Systems Calendar is the first calendar with written records in our country, and its content is very rich, but it gives mystical explanations to various astronomical data, making it difficult for few people to understand for more than a thousand years. It was not until Li Rui, Chen Li, and others in the Qing Dynasty spent a great deal of effort to figure it out, but at this time, many Western theories had been introduced. If they had not or did not bother to study this book, and instead studied Western theories, perhaps the level of modern astronomy in our country would not be so low, so the Three Systems Calendar also hindered the development of astronomy in our country.
    This intentional distortion of astronomical achievements is an obstacle to the development of astronomy. And this obstacle is still very serious in imperialist countries today. Some scholars employed by the bourgeoisie are distorting some of the latest achievements in astronomy (such as the redshift of the spectral lines of extragalactic galaxies) to defend the dying capitalist system and the bourgeoisie's worldview. Only within the socialist camp, under the guidance of the only correct Marxism-Leninism, adhering to the view that science can only be "an understanding of the original appearance of nature without any additions" and the epistemological theory of dialectical materialism, can astronomy develop at a high speed.

    中国天文学史的几个问题
    席泽宗
    生产需要和天文学发展的关系
    天文学是一门自然科学，它是人类在生产实践中向自然作斗争所得到的知识结晶。中华民族最早活动在黄河流域，以游牧为生。那时为了在一望无际的草原上辨认行路的方向，就最早地认识了北斗七星。同时，还发现了一年当中的寒来暑往和黄昏时分在南方天空所看到的星宿的不同有联系。尚书尧典里说：“日中星鸟，以殷仲春”；“日永星火，以正仲夏”；“霄中星虚，以殷仲秋”；“日短星昴，以正仲冬”。这里的日中、日永、霄中、日短即后来的春分、夏至、秋分、冬至，它是一年当中四个最基本的节气。后来为了适应农业生产上的需要，在这四个节气的基础上逐渐发展成为二十四节气。二十四节气的全部名称，首见于汉初的“淮南子”。中国的二十四节气是完全为农业服务的，它是在农业的发展中形成的。中国天文学由于农业上的需要在早期得到了发展，这是一个方面。另一方面，由于长期的停留在农业社会，没有经历过工业革命，没有工业化，也阻碍了天文学的发展。因为对农事的安排，时间差几天也没有关系。但工业上的测量所要求的时间准确度很高。例如，解放后，为了在各处建立工业基地和地质勘探，大地测量工作蓬勃展开；十年来，我国天文学的主要工作就是把时间观测的精确度提高到千分之二秒，以适应大地测量工作的需要，这个任务已于1958年完成了。
    古代天文学中实践和理论的关系
    历法工作是中国古代天文学的主要工作。中国古代历法的特点是要把日月合朔放在每月初一，把冬至放在11月。但是回归年（365.2422日）不能被朔望月（2 9.5306日）整除，而且实用上一月或一年也不能带有日的小数，因此必须截长补短，用闰月的办法来进行调整。闰月是否安插得当，合朔是否正在初一，这要依靠观测来检验。然而合朔是看不见的，只有在日食的时候才能看到，因此就得预先推算日食，以便届时进行观测。所以日食的计算和闰月的安置是中国历代历法的两个主要组成部分。大概在春秋末期已经根据长期的观测资料知道十九年里边应该插入七个闰月，在汉初已经知道在一百三十五个月中最多可以发生二十三次日月食。这两个粗略的周期使得从汉代开始人们可以从理论上推算合朔和日食，推算结果若和观测结果相差很远，就得进行历法改革。从这里可以看出理论对于实践的依赖关系：理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务，同时又为实践所检验。就这样地实践、理论、再实践、再理论，循环往复，一步步地提高了中国的历法和日食计算水平。提高的进度可以用明末徐光启的统计来说明：“日食自汉至隋凡二百九十三，而食于晦日者七十七（占26％），晦前一日者三，初二日者三，其疏如此。唐至五代凡一百一十，而食于晦日者一，初二日者一，初三者一，稍密矣。宋凡一百四十八，则无晦食，更密矣；犹有推食而不食者十三。元凡四十五，亦无晦食，更密矣；犹有推食而不食者一，食而失推者一，夜食而书昼者一；至加时先后，至三、四刻者，当其时已然。至今遵用，安能免此。……汉至今千五百岁，立法者仅十有三家。盖于数百年间一较工拙，非一人之心思知力所能黾勉者也”。（徐文定公集，卷四第七十页）。在这里徐光启不但说出了我国历法逐渐准确的过程，而且说明了科学的进步不是一人之力所能作为，非无数人长期劳动不可。
    天文学家的哲学思想和政治态度对天文学发展的意义
    在阶级社会里，任何人都要附属于一定阶级，所谓“超然”只是反动阶级的欺骗。中国古代的天文学家，基本上是属于统治阶级知识分子，为本阶级服务。但是他们所做的工作又能自发地产生唯物主义。因此古代的天文学家的思想，大都具有唯心和唯物两种成分。凡是成就较大的天文学家，他们思想上的唯物成分总是较多，政治上也比较进步。就拿我国古代的最大的天文学家张衡来说吧，他在年青的时候，就写出“二京赋”，讽刺汉王朝，叫他们不要胜利冲昏头脑，过奢侈无聊的生活；同时严格要求自己“不患位之不尊，而患德之不崇；不耻禄之不伙，而耻知之不博”，认为名利这个东西“得之在命，求之无益。”在哲学思想方面，他更是冒犯着朝章国典，上书皇帝要求禁上当时盛行全国的唯心主义的“图谶之学”。显然，张衡在天文学上的成就和他的这些进步思想是分不开的。再拿宋代的沈括来说，他在政治上支持王安石变法维新，在治学方法上又能贯彻群众路线和实事求是的实验精神。他说：“技巧、器械、大小、尺寸、黑黄苍赤，岂能尽出于圣人；百工、群有司、市井、田野之人莫不预焉”，于是著“梦溪笔谈”，大量地收集劳动人民的创造发明，编成一部科学巨著。其中，有许多关于天文的见解，今天看来也还是新颖的，例如他主张“直以立春之日为孟春之一日，惊蛰为仲春之一日，大尽三十一日，小尽三十日；岁岁齐尽，永无闰月”。这是最彻底的阳历，而且相当优越。由此可见，当一个科学家和劳动人民相结合的时候，才是最富有创造力的时候。
    天文学发展中的矛盾和斗争
    天文学本身具有自发的唯物主义性质。天文学家要有所作为，也必须是唯物主义思想占上风。但这不是说天文学的发展中就没有唯心主义成分。由于历史条件的限制，历来的天文学家没有自觉地学习过辩证唯物主义，他们在认识过程中往往会犯片面性的错误。正如列宁所说：“人的认识不是直线（也不是沿着直线进行的），而是无限地近似于一串圆圈、近似于螺旋的曲线。这一曲线的任何一个片段、碎片、小段都能被变成（被片面地变成）独立的完整的直线，而这条直线能把人们（如果只见树木不见森林的话）引到泥坑里去，引到僧侣主义那里去”（列宁：“哲学笔记”，中译本第三百六十五页）。因此，在一定的实践水平上所认识到的东西，所形成的理论，过了一个时期以后，新的实践会发现其中有缺点甚或完全错误，这样就需要新的观念和理论来修改、补充或代替旧的概念和理论。在修改、补充和代替的过程中，必然有一部分认识上具有片面性的人反对，这样就形成进步与保守之争，构成唯物主义和唯心主义斗争的一个方面。这类的矛盾和斗争，是天文学发展中不可避免的。天文学通过它而得到发展。还有一种原因，能使天文学蒙蔽上一层唯心主义色彩，那就是统治阶级及其知识分子为了达到一定的政治目的，有意识地将天文学的一些成果加以歪曲或作唯心主义的解释。对于天文学本身来说，这是一种外来附加，它必然引起天文学者自发唯物主义的反抗，于是形成唯物主义和唯心主义斗争的又一个方面。这类矛盾阻碍着天文学的发展，它是属于历史范畴的东西。这两类矛盾往往互相联系，互相影响。但在分析具体问题时，我们还是可以看出那一个是主要矛盾。在我国天文学史上，属于前一类矛盾的例子很多，例如从春秋鲁文公元年（公元前六百二十六年）一直到汉太初元年（公元前一百零四年）关于闰月插法的争论，从汉代开始的浑天说和盖天说之争，从刘宋何承天（公元4 43年）开始一直到元代郭守敬（公元1280年）关于平朔、定朔之争。这些争论都进行了很长时间，争论中间迂回曲折，但最终都是更合乎客观事实的学说和方法取得了胜利。关于后者可以举“三统历”为例，刘歆为了支持王莽的托古改制，便把易系辞附会在以观测为基础的“太初历”上，写成“三统历”。我们不否认三统历是我国有文字记载的第一部历法，内容很丰富，但它将各种天文数据给以神秘主义的解释，使得一千多年来很少人能看懂，一直到了清代李锐、陈澧等人花费了九牛二虎之力才搞清楚，然而这时西方学说已大量传来。如果他们没有或不去啃这本书，而去对西方学说进行研究的话，也许我国的近代天文水平，不会如此之低，所以三统历也妨碍了我国天文学的发展。
    这种对天文学成就的有意歪曲，是天文学发展的障碍。而这个障碍，今天在帝国主义国家还很严重，资产阶级的一些御用学者正在歪曲天文学的一些最新成就（如河外星系谱线的红移等）来为垂死的资本主义制度及资产阶级的宇宙观进行辩护。只有在社会主义阵营内，在唯一正确的马克思列宁主义指导下，坚持科学只能是“对自然界本来面目的了解而不给以任何附加”的世界观和辩证唯物主义的认识论，才能使天文学得到高速度发展。
