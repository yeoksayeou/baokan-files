    Anti-Suppression, Fight for Freedom
    Fiji Island Oil Workers Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, Suva, December 16th: The strike by oil workers on the Fiji Islands in the South Pacific has achieved results. On December 15th, representatives of the Oil Workers Union and the British Shell Oil Company authorities signed an agreement in which the oil company authorities agreed to increase the minimum wage from three pounds sixpence per week to three pounds eleven shillings.
    The union's secretary, James Anthony, said that he and the union chairman were not satisfied with the agreement. He hopes to go to London as soon as possible to meet with the British Colonial Secretary to discuss the social, economic, and political situation in Fiji.
    The oil workers' strike last week aroused the Fijian people to rise up in opposition to colonial rule and racial discrimination.
    On December 9th, police interfered with a rally held by oil workers in Suva, using smoke bombs and batons to beat the workers. Fijians in Suva immediately united to oppose the colonial authorities' suppression. The police station arrested four people on the 12th.
    On the 15th, bus and taxi drivers also went on strike in solidarity. The New Zealand Labour Federation and some Australian trade unions sent representatives or wrote letters to support the Fiji Oil Workers Union.

    Fiji Islands
    The Fiji Islands, far away in the South Pacific, have recently seen a new struggle erupt against the British colonial authorities.
    The Fiji Islands are a British colony in the South Pacific. This archipelago, consisting of more than 320 islands of various sizes, has only 106 inhabited islands. Most are volcanic islands, surrounded by coral reefs, with fertile land, a good climate, and abundant resources, covering a total area of 18,200 square kilometers and a population of more than 340,000, including nearly 150,000 Fijians, nearly 170,000 Indians, and more than 4,000 overseas Chinese. The capital is Suva.
    Since annexing the Fiji Islands in 1874, British colonialists have rampantly enslaved and plundered the Fijian people using the most brutal methods.
    The British Governor comprehensively controls Fiji's internal affairs, diplomacy, and military affairs, and administers the surrounding colonial and protectorate islands, such as the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, Tonga, the Solomon Islands, and other islands. Every year, the Governor holds three meetings of upper-level leaders of indigenous peoples in the Fiji Islands. The scope of the discussions is completely limited, and any resolutions must be decided by the Governor.
    Fiji is rich in sugarcane and coconuts. In addition, it also produces oil and gold. Sugarcane is Fiji's most important economic crop, producing large quantities of sugar. However, the sugar industry is entirely monopolized by British colonialists.
    The British established its most important naval base in the South Pacific in Suva, the capital of Fiji. Due to its strategic location on the South Pacific transportation line and being the hub of the US-Australian route, Fiji has strategic significance.
    Under the bloody rule and enslavement of the British colonialists, the Fijian people live an inhuman life, with meager wages and cruel racial discrimination. Lakshman, chairman of the Fiji Sugar Workers Union, said that Fijian workers live in dust and garbage heaps.
    The Fijian people have united to refuse to be beasts of burden for British imperialism, forcing the British to recruit laborers from other places. From 1878, Indian laborers entered the Fiji Islands in large numbers, and later Chinese laborers were also abducted here by British colonialists. The Fijian people's struggle against British imperialism is growing stronger, as evidenced by the recent anti-British struggle of the Fijian people.

    反镇压　争自由
    斐济岛石油工人罢工
    新华社16日讯　苏瓦消息：南太平洋斐济群岛石油工人的罢工已经获得了成果。15日，石油工人工会代表和英国壳牌石油公司当局签订了一项协议，石油公司当局答应把最低工资从每周三镑六便士增加到三镑十一先令。
    这个工会的书记詹姆斯·安东尼说，他和工会主席对这项协议并不满意。他希望尽早到伦敦去见英国殖民大臣，和他谈判有关斐济的社会、经济和政治情况问题。
    石油工人在上星期举行的罢工曾经引起斐济人民纷纷起来反对殖民统治和种族歧视。
    12月9日，警察干涉石油工人在苏瓦举行的集会，他们施放了烟幕弹并且用警棍殴打工人。苏瓦的斐济人立即一致起来反对殖民当局的镇压。警察局在12日逮捕了四个人。
    15日，公共汽车和出租汽车的司机也举行了声援罢工。新西兰劳工联合会和澳大利亚的一些工会派遣代表或写信支持斐济的石油工人工会。
    斐济岛
    远处南太平洋的斐济群岛最近爆发了反抗英国殖民当局的新的斗争。
    斐济群岛是英国在南太平洋的殖民地。这个由大小三百二十多个岛屿组成的群岛，仅有一百零六个岛有人居住。大部为火山岛，周围珊瑚礁环绕，土地肥沃，气候良好，物产丰富，面积共一万八千二百平方公里，人口三十四万多人，其中斐济人近十五万，印度人近十七万，华侨四千多人。首府是苏瓦。
    英国殖民者自1874年吞并斐济群岛以来，大肆以最残暴的方法奴役和掠夺斐济岛人。
    英国总督全面地控制了斐济岛的内政、外交和军事，并管辖周围的殖民地和保护地岛屿，如吉尔柏特和埃里斯群岛、东加、所罗门群岛及其他岛屿。每年总督在斐济群岛召开土著民族上层领袖的会议三次，会议讨论的范围，完全是被限制的，任何决议都必须由总督决定。
    斐济岛盛产甘蔗、椰子。此外，还出产石油和黄金。甘蔗是斐济岛最重要的经济作物，出产大量的糖。但糖业全由英国殖民者所垄断。
    英国在斐济岛的首府苏瓦建立了它在南太平洋上最重要的海军根据地。由于斐济岛处于南太平洋的交通线上，是美澳航线的中枢，具有战略意义。
    在英国殖民者的血腥统治和奴役下，斐济人民过着非人的生活，工资少得可怜，还要受到残酷的种族歧视。斐济制糖工人职工联合会主席拉克希曼说，斐济工人是在尘埃和垃圾堆中度日的。
    斐济岛人民曾团结起来拒绝为英帝国主义当牛马，迫使英国不得不从别的地方召募劳工。从1878年起，印度劳工大量进入斐济群岛，其后又有中国劳工被英国殖民者拐骗到这里来。斐济岛人民反对英帝国主义的斗争日益壮大，最近斐济人民的反英斗争，就是证明。
