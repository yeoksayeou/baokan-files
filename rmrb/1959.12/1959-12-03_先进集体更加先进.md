    Advanced Collective Becomes More Advanced
    After Zhuang Hongsheng, the representative of the Zhuang Hongsheng excavation team of the excavation area No. 1 of the Hanqiao Mine in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, which is an advanced collective attending the National Hero Conference, returned, the workers of this team became even more motivated.
    They have already overfulfilled their annual excavation plan.
    Now, they have proposed to further engage in technical innovation and strive for a greater leap forward. Previously, some workers believed that "long drill rods cannot have multiple cycles." Now, the entire team has broken this superstitious thought. First, the Hu Jingkui team created the double-cycle experience of using a six-meter drill rod to drill one borehole and then adding a three-meter drill rod for another borehole, increasing the progress by more than 50%. The workers analyzed that the main key to long drill rods having multiple cycles is the problem of digging, loading, and transportation. They then innovated on this key. On the one hand, they further promoted the fast digging and loading experience of the Wu Xiulun team, and on the other hand, they improved the organization of labor, changing from two people pushing a cart to one person pushing a cart, increasing the transportation from four wooden carts per shift to six carts. They achieved long drill rod double cycles and completed a ten-day plan in five days. Then, they further improved the transportation work, achieving long drill rod triple and quadruple cycles, creating a maximum record of 65.9 meters per day, exceeding the plan by more than seven times. The entire month of November was planned for 240 meters, but it was completed in just nine days. By November 13, the entire team was already working on the tasks planned for April 1960.

### 先进集体更加先进

    先进集体更加先进
    出席全国群英会的先进集体、江苏省徐州市韩桥矿掘进一区庄洪生掘进小组的代表庄洪生回来以后，这个小组工人的干劲更足了。
    他们全年的掘进计划已经超额完成。
    现在，他们又提出要进一步大搞技术革新，争取更大的跃进。以前，有些工人认为“长钎子不能多循环”，现在全组打破了这种迷信思想，首先由胡井奎班创造了六米钎子打一查炮、再加三米钎子一查炮的双循环经验，进度提高了50％以上。工人们分析了长钎子多循环的主要关键，是扒装运输问题。他们就在这个关键上闹革新，一方面进一步推广吴修伦班的快速扒装经验，一方面改进劳动组织，把两人推车改为一个人推，每班由四辆木车运输增加到六辆。实现了长钎子双循环，五天就完成了一旬的计划。接着，他们进一步改进运输工作，达到了长钎子三循环、四循环，创造了日进六十五点九米的最高纪录，超过计划七倍多。11月份全月计划二百四十米，只用九天就完成了。到11月13日，全组已经在干1960年4月份的活了。
