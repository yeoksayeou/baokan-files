    Anhui Province Finance and Trade Steel Plant Modestly Learns from Experience
    Creates Advanced Record of High Yield, High Quality, and Low Consumption for Small Blast Furnaces
    Average Utilization Coefficient of Youth Furnace at Anyang No. 2 Steel Plant Reaches 3.24
    (Reported by this newspaper) The No. 12 blast furnace of the Anhui Province Finance and Trade Steel Plant has created an advanced record of high quality, high yield, and low consumption for small blast furnaces.
    This eight-cubic-meter small blast furnace was put into production on October 14th this year. From October 15th to 31st, the average utilization coefficient reached 2.65, the pig iron qualification rate was 100%, and the coke consumption per ton of pig iron was 0.82 tons. Entering November, the production level rose sharply. The average monthly utilization coefficient reached 3.253, the highest reaching 4.646, the pig iron qualification rate was 100%, and the coke ratio was 0.87.
    The equipment of the No. 12 blast furnace is very simple, and the coke is the local coke refined by the factory itself. Under the leadership of the Party, the workers of this furnace earnestly studied advanced experience and improved their smelting technology. They put forward the slogan of "Learn from where it is advanced, catch up with where it is advanced." When they saw in the newspaper that the highest utilization coefficient of the No. 1 blast furnace of the Wuhu Prefectural Committee-directly affiliated Steel Plant reached 4.002, they compared and checked themselves item by item according to their experience, and in one go, caught up on October 25, with a utilization coefficient of 4.018. When the People's Daily reported that the average utilization coefficient of the Red Flag No. 2 blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company reached 3.201 in October, the highest reaching above 4, the average coke ratio was 0.812, and the qualification rate was 100%, they formulated specific measures to catch up with the Red Flag No. 2 blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company in November. Because everyone had clear goals and was full of energy, the average and highest utilization coefficients in November exceeded those of the Red Flag No. 2 blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, reaching the advanced national level. The workers of the No. 12 blast furnace also conscientiously studied and promoted the "five stability" operation experience of the No. 11 blast furnace of this factory (stable wind pressure, stable wind temperature, stable load, stable charging system, stable slag and iron tapping time) and the "four diligence" experience of Chen Yutang, the hot blast worker of the No. 4 blast furnace, in managing the hot blast furnace (diligent in cleaning ash, diligent in changing water, diligent in observing, diligent in adjusting). In terms of raw material management, they also promoted the advanced experience of "three cleanliness" (screening out ash, washing away mud, picking out large pieces) of the No. 1 furnace in this factory and implementing two-stage crushing of small materials into the furnace. This quickly improved the technical level and mastered the production law of the blast furnace.
    In addition, according to the experience of this factory and other places, they changed the tuyeres from three to four, changed the T-shaped cold air pipe to a herringbone shape, and added a hot air main pipe directly to the surrounding pipe, thereby ensuring large air and high temperature operation, so that the output and quality rose sharply.
    (Reported by this newspaper) The eight-cubic-meter youth furnace with brick structure of Anyang No. 2 Steel Plant in Henan Province achieved an average utilization coefficient of 3.24 in November, with coke consumption of 0.94 tons per ton of iron, a pig iron qualification rate of 89%, and an average efficiency of five people per ton of iron, creating a new record in the province for continuous high yield, high quality, high efficiency, and low consumption of small blast furnaces.
    The reason why this small blast furnace has been able to achieve continuous high yield and comprehensive leap forward is that the Party Committee of the factory has adhered to putting politics in command, overcoming all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas, and mobilizing the workers to carry out comprehensive technical transformation of the small blast furnace. The main thing was to transform the hot blast system. The original hot blast furnace adopted parallel operation of two machines and parallel air supply of two hot blast furnaces. Using this method, hot air could not be completely sent into the blast furnace. The air supply of the two blowers of the eight-cubic-meter blast furnace was 84 cubic meters per minute, but only half of the air was actually sent to the blast furnace, which affected the increase in furnace temperature and the increase in output. In response to this shortcoming, the factory leaders, after discussing with the workers, decided to adopt a multi-machine and multi-pipe separate air supply method with one blower, one cold air pipe, and one hot air pipe, plus the promotion of the advanced experience of multi-nozzle low-position combustion. The air temperature of the hot blast furnace was increased from 400 degrees to about 600 degrees, and the amount of air received in the blast furnace reached eight times the volume of the furnace body, meeting the requirements for high yield; the hot air pressure also increased from 80 in the past to 185 mercury columns. They also increased the load of the blast furnace, increased the smelting intensity, and correspondingly improved the charging system, which greatly increased the output.

    创造小高炉高产优质低耗先进纪录
    安阳市第二钢铁厂青年炉平均利用系数达到三点二四
    本报讯　安徽省财贸钢铁厂十二号高炉，创造了小高炉优质高产低消耗的先进纪录。
    这座八立方米小高炉是今年10月14日投入生产的，从10月15日至31日的平均利用系数就达到二点六五，生铁合格率达100％，每吨生铁耗焦零点八二吨。进入11月份，生产水平直线上升。全月平均利用系数达三点二五三，最高达到四点六四六，生铁合格率100％，焦比零点八七。
    十二号高炉的设备很简单，焦炭是本厂炼的土焦。这座炉的职工在党的领导下，踏踏实实学习先进经验，提高冶炼技术。他们提出了“哪里先进，就学哪里、赶哪里”的口号。当他们在报纸上看到芜湖地委直属钢铁厂八立方米一号高炉最高利用系数达到四点零零二时，便按人家的经验，逐条对照检查自己，一鼓作气，在10月25日赶了上去，利用系数达到四点零一八。当人民日报报道马鞍山钢铁公司红旗二号高炉10月份平均利用系数达到三点二零一，最高达到四以上，平均焦比零点八一二，合格率100％的消息后，他们就订出11月份赶马钢红旗二号高炉的具体措施。由于人人目标明确，干劲十足，11月份平均利用系数和最高利用系数，都超过了马钢红旗二号高炉，达到了全国先进的水平。十二号高炉职工还认真研究推广了本厂十一号高炉的“五稳”操作经验（稳定风压、稳定风温、稳定负荷、稳定装料制度、稳定出渣铁时间）和四号高炉热风工陈玉堂管理热风炉的“四勤”经验（勤清灰、勤换水、勤观察、勤调剂）。在原料管理方面，还推广了本厂一号炉的“三净”（灰分筛净、泥土洗净、大块拣净）和实行两级破碎小料入炉的先进经验。这就很快地提高了技术水平，掌握了高炉的生产规律。
    此外，他们还根据本厂及外地的经验，把风口由三个改成四个，丁字形冷风管改成人字形的，增加一个热风总管直通到围管，从而保证了大风高温操作，使产量、质量直线上升。
    本报讯　河南省安阳市第二钢铁厂砖结构的八立方米青年炉，11月份平均利用系数达到三点二四，每吨铁耗焦炭零点九四吨，生铁合格率89％，全员效率平均五人一吨铁，创全省小高炉连续高产、优质、高效率、低消耗的新纪录。
    这座小高炉所以能够连续高产，全面跃进，是由于厂党委坚持了政治挂帅，战胜了形形色色的右倾保守思想，发动职工群众对小高炉进行了全面的技术改造。主要是改造了热风系统。原来的热风炉是采取双机并联和两个热风炉并联送风。使用这种办法，热风不能全部送进高炉。八立方米高炉的两个风机送风量每分钟是八十四立方米，但是，实际送到高炉里的风只有一半，这样就影响炉温的提高和产量的上升。针对这个缺点，厂领导人员经过和工人研究，决定采用一个鼓风机、一个冷风管和一个热风管的多机多管分道送风的办法，再加上推广多嘴低位置燃烧的先进经验，适当加粗了送风管道，加大了风嘴直径，热风炉的风温便由四百度提高到六百度左右，高炉内接受的风量达到炉体容积的八倍，满足了高产的要求；热风压也由过去的八十提高到一百八十五个水银柱。他们还加大了高炉负荷，提高了冶炼强度，并相应地改进了上料制度，这样就大大提高了产量。
