    Improving Labor Organization and Labor Methods Centered on Technological Innovation:
    Labor Shortage in Shazhen Commune Resolved

    (Our dispatch) Jinan – The Shazhen Commune in Liaocheng County, Shandong Province, launched a high work efficiency movement centered on technological innovation, mobilizing the masses to solve the difficulty of labor shortage. By the end of November, they had completed more than 70% of the various winter production tasks, more than double the amount of farm work completed in the same period last year.

    According to the commune's calculation of the entire winter's tasks, a total of 2.13 million workdays would be needed from the beginning of October to the end of the year. Based on the existing labor force, each person should work an average of 116 workdays, but there were only ninety days, so the labor force was obviously insufficient. The commune's Party committee mobilized all commune members to find ways to tap labor resources to ensure the realization of the winter production plan. The commune members put forward more than 30 ways to solve the labor shortage, which can be summarized into four aspects:

    1. Innovate tools. In terms of transportation and field operations, the seven-style light and convenient deep plows (which are twice as efficient as single-blade plows), wooden-wheeled carts with rubber tires (which doubled the carrying capacity and increased the speed by one-third), and animal-powered fertilizer application and soil loosening machines for wheat fields (which are more than ten times more efficient) were widely promoted. These three types of tools saved a total of more than 189,000 labor and animal power days. The comprehensive utilization of irrigation and drainage machinery played an even greater role in solving the labor shortage. Originally, the entire commune's grain and feed processing required at least 1,000 head of livestock and 1,000 people every day. Later, by fully utilizing the 18 irrigation and drainage machines, they drove more than a dozen processing tools such as steel mills, improved stone mills, stone rollers, cotton gins, cotton gins, and feed crushers. The entire commune's flour and feed processing was basically mechanized and semi-mechanized. This winter, this aspect alone can save 100,000 human and 100,000 animal power days.

    2. Rationally use labor and cleverly arrange farm work. First of all, each production team, based on the priority of farm work and the strength of the labor force, organized various professional troops to make the best use of everyone's talents. Cadres from the commune to the production team clarified their division of responsibilities and implemented a six-determination (leadership, labor, tasks, time, specifications, remuneration) and one-reward responsibility system. In terms of farm work arrangement, each stage has its own focus, and the focus leads the general. For example, after the wheat sowing was completed, while carrying out water conservancy construction, they concentrated their efforts on five small-stage assaults, including wheat inspection and replanting, harvesting the remnants of autumn, deep plowing and leveling the land, and accumulating fertilizer. All 1,200 feeders in the commune universally combined usage with feeding, adding more than 800 laborers to field labor every day.

    3. Improve labor methods. Originally, the fertilizer transportation roads of each production team were not only uneven, but also very roundabout. This winter, in conjunction with leveling the land, they straightened the bends and repaired a total of more than 60 roads with a total length of more than 300 li, and also built field tillage roads, which greatly shortened the fertilizer transportation distance. The fertilizer transportation for only 30,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields can save more than 17,000 labor days. Improving fertilizer-saving methods can also greatly save labor. Each production team earnestly implemented the method of building pig farms in the fields for on-site pig raising, on-site material preparation, on-site fertilizer accumulation, and on-site fertilization. More than 8,000 pig pens in the commune have now been moved to the fields. In addition, according to the characteristics of short days and long nights in winter, the practice of starting work early, ending work late, and delivering meals at noon is universally implemented.

    4. Arrange the lives of commune members well. Since the beginning of winter, the canteens have been universally rectified, and nurseries and dismantling and sewing groups have been established, so that more than 3,700 women in the commune who have labor but are burdened by housework can participate in labor with peace of mind.

### 以技术革新为中心改进劳动组织和劳动方法  沙镇公社劳力不足得到解决

    以技术革新为中心改进劳动组织和劳动方法
    沙镇公社劳力不足得到解决
    本报讯　山东聊城市沙镇公社开展以技术革新为中心的高工效运动，发动群众解决了劳力不足的困难。到11月底，已完成冬季各项生产任务的70％以上，比去年同期农活多完成一倍多。
    这个公社根据整个冬季任务计算，从10月初到年底，共需用工二百一十三万个；按现有劳力计算，平均每人应做一百一十六个工日，但时间仅仅只有九十天，劳动力显然不够用。公社党委发动全体社员千方百计挖掘劳力，保证实现冬季生产计划。社员一共提出三十多条解决劳力不足的办法，归纳起来有四个方面：
    一、革新工具。在运输和田间操作方面，普遍推行了七式轻便深耕犁（较单铧犁效率提高一倍），木轮小车加胶胎（运量提高了一倍，速度提高三分之一），麦田畜力追肥松土器（效率提高十倍多），以上三种工具共节省劳畜力十八万九千多个。排灌机械综合利用对解决劳力不足的作用更大。原来全社粮食和饲料加工，每天最少要用一千头牲畜和一千个人力。后来把十八部排灌机械充分利用起来，带动了钢磨、改良石磨、石碾、弹花机、轧花机、饲料粉碎机等十几种加工工具，全社面粉、饲料加工基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。今冬在这一方面就能节省十万个人力和十万个畜力。
    二、合理使用劳力，巧妙安排农活。首先是各生产队本着农活的轻重缓急，劳力的强弱等，组织各路专业大军，使人尽其才。从公社一直到生产小队的干部都明确分线分工负责，实行六定（领导、劳力、任务、时间、规格、报酬）一奖责任制。在农活安排上，段段有重点，重点带一般。如小麦播种结束后，在开展水利建设的同时，集中力量搞了小麦查补、收拾残秋、深耕平整土地、积肥等五次小段突击。全社一千二百个饲养员普遍做到使用和喂养相结合，每天增加八百多个劳力投入田间劳动。
    三、改进劳动方法。原来各生产队的运肥道路不但高低不平，而且绕道很远。今冬结合平整土地取弯修直，共改路六十多条，全长三百余华里，还修筑了田间耕作路，大大缩短了运肥路程。只三万亩小麦丰产方的运肥，就能节省一万七千多个劳动日。改进节肥方法，也能大大节省劳力。各生产队认真执行了田间建场就地养猪、就地整料、就地积肥，就地施肥的办法。全社现在已有八千多口猪的圈移置到田间。此外，根据冬季天短夜长的特点，普遍实行早上工、晚收工和中午送饭的办法。
    四、安排好社员生活。入冬以来，普遍整顿了食堂，成立了托儿所、拆洗缝纫组，使全社三千七百多名有劳力而被家务缠身的妇女，安心地参加了劳动。
