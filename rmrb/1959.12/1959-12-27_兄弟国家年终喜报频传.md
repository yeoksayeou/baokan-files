Brotherly Countries Frequently Report Good News at the End of the Year

Vietnam: Another Batch of Factories and Mines Complete This Year's Plan Ahead of Schedule; Albania: Twelve Enterprises Enter 1960; Poland: This Year's Total Industrial Output Will Increase by 8.5%; Bulgaria: Industrial Production in the Capital and Other Places Reports Success Ahead of Schedule

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 25th: To welcome the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party (January 6, 1960), the upsurge of the "Patriotic Emulation Movement" to present gifts to the Party, launched by the broad masses of workers and staff in North Vietnam, continues to rise. On the industrial front, following a large number of factories and mines that completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule, another batch of factories and mines have entered 1960.

　　Nam Dinh Textile Factory, Vietnam's largest textile factory, exceeded its annual production plan for cloth and silk on the 18th and 21st of this month, respectively. Many advanced production groups have emerged in the various workshops of this factory during the competition. Forty-nine outstanding workers have honorably joined the Labor Party.

　　Hanoi Gia Lam Locomotive Repair Factory, Lao Cai Apatite Mine, Hai Phong Port, Phu Tho Tea Factory, Hai Phong Water Plant, and other enterprises and many construction sites have also completed their annual plans ahead of schedule.

　　This newspaper, Tirana, December 26th: The Albanian people have just joyfully celebrated the 15th anniversary of liberation, and now they are welcoming 1960 with the good news of completing the annual plan ahead of schedule. In recent days, twelve enterprises in Albania have completed the 1959 annual plan ahead of schedule and successfully entered 1960.

　　Workers in the capital, Tirana, have exceeded the plan and excellently produced industrial products worth 437 million leks for the country. The workers of the Stalin Textile United Factory, which has always produced banners for Albania, have not only completed the plan, but also produced 400,000 meters more of cotton fabrics.

　　Thousands of outstanding workers in various regions of the country are ahead of schedule. For example, in the Pogradec District, 387 workers have started working for February next year, and 24 workers are already working for March next year. Three tractor drivers from the Gjinokaster Tractor Station are engaged in the work for 1961, 1962, and 1963, respectively, while Vashar Kasifa is already working for 1964.

　　These excellent achievements are primarily due to the socialist labor competition organized effectively by the Albanian Labor Party, trade unions, and youth leagues, and the continuous absorption of the wisdom of the broad masses of workers to carry out technological innovations and continuously improve labor productivity. The movement to strive for the glorious title of "Production Team for the 15th Anniversary of the Liberation of the Motherland," proposed by workers of the Stalin Textile Factory, has quickly unfolded in the industrial, mining, transportation, construction, and rural production sectors since February. Now, more than 9,400 young men and women have participated, among which 164 production teams in the capital Tirana have overproduced 23.75 million leks worth of products and saved 14 million leks in participating in this movement. The initiatives to save raw materials and increase labor quotas have also been widely supported in various enterprises. The construction sector alone has revised nearly 300 kinds of quotas, with an average increase of 15%. Many workers have decided to officially change the trial quotas into technical quotas. After raising the labor quota by 9.5%, the Shkodër Textile Factory broke this quota again, and in October alone, the workers overproduced 1.21 million leks worth of products.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 25th: Poland has made great achievements on the industrial front in 1959. The production of the entire industry, especially heavy industry, has developed rapidly. The enthusiasm of the working people to build socialism continues to rise, and labor productivity has greatly improved.

　　Due to the good situation on the Polish industrial front, Poland's industrial production this year will exceed the annual plan by 1.3%, and the total industrial output value will increase by 8.5% compared with last year.

　　This year, the growth of the production of means of production in Poland is faster than in any of the recent years. It is estimated that the production of means of production this year will increase by 10.2% compared with 1958, exceeding the plan for this year by 3.9%; the production of consumer goods will increase by 6.7%.

　　In terms of basic construction, Poland is carrying out large-scale construction everywhere this year. At present, there are 120 large enterprises under construction in the country. Dozens of large enterprises have been started and expanded this year alone.

　　Poland's chemical industry and machinery manufacturing industry have achieved great development this year. The chemical industry produced 400 kinds of new products this year, 128 more than in 1958. The machinery manufacturing industry manufactured more than 70 kinds of new machines and equipment this year.

　　The further growth of the enthusiasm of Polish industrial workers to build socialism is a major feature of this year's industrial front. At the beginning of this year, the Polish working people launched a large-scale labor competition to welcome the convening of the Third Congress of the United Workers' Party, and they put forward various guarantees to present gifts to the Party Congress. Forty thousand young people alone participated in this gift-giving movement.

　　The rising enthusiasm of the Polish working people to build socialism is also manifested in the nationwide discussion on the directives of the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the Polish national economy from 1959 to 1965. The employees of all industrial and mining enterprises in the country participated in this discussion. They unanimously supported the development goals put forward by the Party in the discussion, made guarantees to the Party to overfulfill the Seven-Year Plan, and enthusiastically put forward suggestions for improving production. For example, workers in Katowice Province, the industrial center, put forward more than 20,000 suggestions in the discussion of the Party Central Committee's instructions.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 25th: The Bulgarian people are welcoming 1960 with new achievements. In recent days, good news of completing the annual plan ahead of schedule has continued to come from various production fronts.

　　The industrial enterprises in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, which accounts for a quarter of the country's total industrial output value, have completed this year's production plan ten days ahead of schedule. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the city's 155 industrial enterprises will exceed the annual plan by 3.5%. They will produce 135 more lathes, 1,000 tons of steel castings, and 250 tons of cotton yarn than originally planned.

　　The employees of the industrial enterprises in Dimitrovo Oblast have started producing products for 1960 since December 19. It is estimated that by the end of the year, they will overproduce products worth more than 75 million leva (Bulgarian currency) beyond the plan.

　　The industrial production plan of Gabrovo Oblast has been completed fifteen days ahead of schedule. By the end of the year, the industrial enterprises in this oblast will produce products worth about 92 million leva for the country.

　　After completing this year's production plan on the 22nd of this month, the employees of Sliven Oblast also guaranteed that they would never slack off, and would work harder and more enthusiastically to strive to overfulfill next year's production leap plan. (Attached picture)

　　兄弟国家年终喜报频传
    越南又一批厂矿提前完成今年计划　阿尔巴尼亚十二个企业跨进1960年  波兰今年工业总产值将增长8.5％　保加利亚首都等地工业生产提前报捷
　　据新华社河内25日电　为迎接越南劳动党成立三十周年（1960年1月6日），越南北方广大职工开展的向党献礼“爱国竞赛运动”的热潮继续高涨。在工业战线上，继一大批厂矿提前完成全年生产计划之后，又有一批厂矿跨进1960年。
      越南最大的纺织工厂南定纺织厂在本月18日和21日先后超额完成全年的布、绸生产计划。这个工厂的各个车间在竞赛运动中涌现了许多先进生产小组。有四十九名优秀工人光荣地加入了劳动党。
    河内嘉林机车修理厂、老街磷灰石矿、海防港口、富寿茶厂、海防自来水厂等企业和许多建筑工地也先后提前完成了全年计划。
    本报地拉那26日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民刚刚欢欣鼓舞地庆祝了解放十五年的节日，现在又以提前完成年度计划的捷报迎接1960年。近日来阿尔巴尼亚全国已有十二个企业单位提前完成了1959年全年计划，胜利地跨进了1960年。
    首都地拉那工人超过计划出色地为国家生产了价值四亿三千七百多万里克的工业产品。一贯为阿尔巴尼亚全国生产旗帜的斯大林纺织联合工厂的工人们，不仅完成了计划，并且多生产了四十万米的棉织品。
    全国各个区都有成千优秀工人走在时间前面，如波格拉迪茨区已有三百八十七个工人开始了明年2月份的工作，二十四个工人已在进行明年3月份的工作，纪诺卡斯特拖拉机站的三个拖拉机手已分别从事1961、1962、1963年的工作，而瓦谢尔·卡西法已在从事1964年的工作了。
    这些优良的成就的得来，首先是由于在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、工会和青年团的有效组织下开展了社会主义劳动竞赛和不断地吸取广大工人的智慧进行技术革新，不断提高劳动生产率的结果。由斯大林纺织厂工人提出的争取“祖国解放十五周年生产队”光荣称号的运动自从2月份开始以来，很快就在工矿、交通、建筑各生产部门和农村中展开。现在参加的青年男女已有九千四百多人，其中首都地拉那的一百六十四个生产队在参加这一运动中已超额生产了二千三百七十五万里克的产品，同时节约了一千四百万里克。节省原材料和提高劳动定额的倡议也在各企业中得到了广泛的支持。单建筑部门就已修订了近三百种定额，定额平均提高了15％，不少工人决定把试行定额正式改为技术定额。斯库台纺织厂在提高劳动定额9.5％后，又打破了这个定额，仅10月份一个月工人们就超额生产了价值一百二十一万里克的产品。
    据新华社华沙25日电　1959年波兰在工业战线上取得了巨大的成就。整个工业、尤其是重工业的生产发展得很快。劳动人民建设社会主义的热情继续高涨，劳动生产率有了很大提高。
    由于波兰工业战线上的良好形势，今年波兰的工业生产将超额1.3％完成年度计划，工业总产值将比去年增长8.5％。
    今年波兰生产资料生产的增长比近几年来的任何一年都快。预计，今年生产资料的生产将比1958年增长10.2％，超计划3.9％完成今年的计划；消费品的生产将增加6.7％。
    在基本建设方面，今年波兰各地都在大兴土木。目前，全国正在建设中的大型企业就有一百二十个。仅在今年开工兴建和扩建的大型企业就有几十个。
    波兰的化学工业和机器制造业今年获得了巨大的发展。化学工业今年生产的新产品就达四百种，比1958年多一百二十八种。机器制造业今年制造了七十种以上的新型机器和设备。
    波兰工业劳动者建设社会主义的热情的进一步的增长，是今年工业战线上的一大特色。还在今年年初，波兰全国劳动人民就为迎接统一工人党第三次代表大会的召开而开展了规模巨大的劳动竞赛，他们纷纷提出各种保证，向党代表大会献礼。单是参加这一献礼运动的青年就有四十万人。
    波兰劳动人民建设社会主义的高涨热情，还表现在全民讨论1959—1965年波兰国民经济发展的七年计划的指示上面。全国所有工矿企业的职工都参加了这一讨论。他们在讨论中一致支持党所提出的发展目标，向党提出了超额完成七年计划的保证，并且踊跃提出了改进生产的建议。例如，工业中心区的卡托维茨省的工人在讨论党中央的指示中共提出了二万多条建议。
    据新华社索非亚25日电　保加利亚人民正在以新的成就迎接1960年，最近几天以来，从各个生产战线上继续传来提前完成年度计划的捷报。
    占全国工业总产值四分之一的保加利亚首都索非亚市的工业企业已经提前十天完成了今年的生产计划。预计，全市一百五十五个工业企业到今年年底，将超额3.5％完成年度计划。他们将比原计划多生产一百三十五台旋床、一千吨钢铸件和二百五十吨棉纱。
    季米特洛沃州工业企业的职工们，从12月19日起，就已开始生产1960年的产品。预计，到年底，他们将超计划生产价值七千五百多万列弗（保币）的产品。
    加布罗沃州的工业生产计划已提前十五天完成。到年底，这个州的工业企业还将给国家生产约值九千二百万列弗的产品。
    斯利文州的职工们在本月22日完成了今年生产计划之后，又保证决不松劲，要更愉快紧张地劳动，争取超额完成明年的生产跃进计划。（附图片）
