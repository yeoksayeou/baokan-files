Holding High the Banner of Marxism-Leninism
    ——On the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party
    By Our Correspondents Wei Lingbing and Wang Chongjie

    The Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has victoriously concluded amidst rousing songs of triumph and advancing bugle calls! This is a triumphant gathering after the complete crushing of the counter-revolutionary rebellion and the achievement of brilliant successes in socialist construction. It is a rally to pledge to accelerate socialist construction towards even greater victories!

    During the congress period (November 30 to December 5), the Budapest Construction Workers' Union Building became the focus of attention for the people of the whole country. Every morning, more than seven hundred party representatives would arrive here with the morning sun. Among them were miners from Komló, tractor drivers from the Algyő Plain, famous scholars and artists, and leading party and government officials. These outstanding sons and daughters of the working people conscientiously summarized the party's struggle experience and formulated the future combat tasks.

    At this solemn moment, every representative would recall the difficult and glorious path the party has traversed. Forty years ago, the Hungarian communists, following the Russian working class, established the second Soviet Republic in the world, shaking the capitalist world. Over the past forty years, the party has won many victories in the course of struggle, and has also suffered temporary failures and setbacks; but the communists have always broken through all obstacles and steadfastly led the working people towards the ultimate goal of communism!

    This congress was convened under the international situation where the red flag of socialism has been planted on the moon and the East wind prevails over the West wind. The domestic situation in Hungary is also very encouraging. The prestige of the Socialist Workers' Party among the masses is growing. Under the leadership of the party, the unity of the whole people is stronger than ever, and a surge of labor emulation is surging in the industrial and mining sectors. To date, most industrial sectors have reached the main targets set by the Three-Year Plan more than a year ahead of schedule. After the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement in the spring, socialist management has been implemented on more than 50% of the country's cultivated land. At present, individual peasants are flocking to the socialist road. Flowers are also blooming in the literary and art garden.

    This congress was filled with a warm and harmonious atmosphere from beginning to end, fully demonstrating the party's steel-like unity based on Marxist-Leninist principles and its lively and vigorous democratic style. In their speeches, the representatives unanimously supported the political line and socialist construction policies pursued by the Party Central Committee over the past three years. Many representatives also made strict criticisms of shortcomings in their work.

    Three years ago, the imperialist group headed by the United States, colluding with domestic counter-revolutionary forces and revisionists in Hungary, launched a frenzied attack on the Hungarian People's Republic. They attempted to overthrow the people's democratic regime and break through the entire socialist camp. During the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the imperialists and revisionists laughed hideously, thinking that socialist Hungary no longer existed. In that critical situation that determined the destiny of the motherland and the people, outstanding communists and patriots firmly took up arms and, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet army, smashed the imperialists' conspiracy, suppressed the counter-revolutionaries and the revisionist traitor group headed by Imre Nagy, and defended national independence, peace, and the achievements of socialist construction.

    In the flames of the struggle against the counter-revolution, the vanguard of the Hungarian proletariat, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, purged the revisionists, making the party ranks unprecedentedly pure and united, the dictatorship of the proletariat was further consolidated, and the political consciousness and vigilance of the working people were greatly enhanced. Truly, a bad thing turned into a good thing.

    In their speeches, the representatives unanimously condemned the treacherous acts of the revisionists. They believed that the entire process of the revisionists headed by Imre Nagy, from attacking and distorting the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, splitting the party's unity, to colluding with imperialism and all reactionary forces, launching a counter-revolutionary rebellion, until finally being completely annihilated, typically illustrates the danger of revisionism in the international communist movement and the inevitability of its ultimate demise.

    The congress pointed out: In the future, we must continue to wage an irreconcilable struggle against revisionism, and never allow imperialism to find its agents in the vanguard of the Hungarian proletariat again.

    Based on the economic achievements already made and the unprecedented upsurge in the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses, the congress put forward to the entire party and the whole people the grand goal of completing the work of laying the foundation for socialism in the next few years, and further accelerating the speed of socialist construction. The instructions on the formulation of the Second Five-Year Plan adopted by the congress outlined a bright and vigorous prospect. By 1965, industrial production should increase by at least 65% to 70% compared with the level of 1958, at which time industrial production will be more than four times that of 1949. Industrial labor productivity will increase by 37% to 40%. This means that two-thirds of the production growth will be achieved by increasing labor productivity.

    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the state's investment alone will reach 170 billion to 175 billion forints. National income will increase by 50% compared with 1958. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, agricultural production cooperation will be realized nationwide. At the same time, agricultural production will achieve unprecedented rapid development. From 1961 to 1965, the average agricultural output will increase by 30% to 32% compared with the average output from 1954 to 1958. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the use of chemical fertilizers will be doubled compared to now, and the number of tractors will increase by one and a half times.

    With the development of production, the people's lives will be further improved.

    Delegations or representatives from forty-six fraternal parties from all over the world attended the congress. They brought to the congress the congratulations of millions of communists and working people, and news of the victories in socialist construction and the national liberation struggle. They cheered for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party for holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and leading the people of the whole country to smash the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and were gratified for the great achievements made by their fraternal party in socialist construction.

    The representatives of the fraternal parties who spoke at the congress believed that the victory of the Hungarian people in extinguishing the counter-revolutionary rebellion not only saved socialist Hungary, but also had great historical significance in the international communist movement. They also believed that the armed assistance of the Soviet Union, the moral support of the people of socialist countries and the world peace forces were important factors in achieving this victory. The anti-Soviet and anti-communist backlash and the rampant attacks of the revisionists on Marxism-Leninism, which were set off in many countries three years ago, were also thoroughly defeated due to the strong unity of the world proletariat.

    The imperialist group, especially US imperialism, has not accepted the lessons of the disastrous defeat of instigating the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion, and is now forcing the so-called "Hungarian question" onto the agenda of the UN General Assembly. Comrade Khrushchev, head of the CPSU delegation, and Comrade Tan Zhenlin, head of the CPC delegation, who attended the congress, both severely condemned the conspiracy manufactured by the imperialists in their speeches to the congress, believing that this was a crude interference in Hungary's internal affairs.

    The representatives of the fraternal parties who spoke at the congress unanimously condemned the war policy and aggression of the imperialist group headed by the United States. They all emphasized that the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America are developing vigorously, and the imperialists are no longer able to stop the struggle of the people of colonies and semi-colonies for independence and freedom.

    The speeches of the representatives of the fraternal parties at the congress were full of the spirit of great international proletarian solidarity. The attempts of the imperialists and revisionists to split the socialist camp and the international communist movement have completely failed.

    The call of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Congress to complete the work of laying the foundation for socialism and accelerate socialist construction in the next few years has been warmly responded to by the people of the whole country, and they are struggling to achieve this great goal!

    高举马克思列宁主义旗帜
    ——记匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会
    本报记者　魏凌冰　王崇杰
    匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会在激昂的凯歌和挺进的号角声中胜利闭幕了。这是彻底粉碎反革命暴乱并在社会主义建设方面取得辉煌成就后的凯旋大会，这是加速社会主义建设走向更大胜利的誓师大会！
    在大会期间（11月30日到12月5日）布达佩斯建筑工会大厦成了全国人民注视的中心。每天清晨，七百多名党代表便迎着晨曦赶到这里。他们当中有科姆洛的矿工，有阿尔干德平原的拖拉机手，有著名的学者和艺术家，有党政负责人。这些劳动人民的优秀儿女认真负责地总结了党的斗争经验，制定了今后的战斗任务。
    在这庄严的时刻，每个代表都会回忆一下党所走过的艰难而光荣的道路。四十年前匈牙利的共产党人就继俄国工人阶级之后在世界上建立了第二个苏维埃共和国，震动了资本主义世界。四十年来，党在斗争过程中取得了许多胜利，也遭受过暂时的失败和挫折；但共产党人总是冲破一切障碍，坚定不移地领导劳动人民向着共产主义的最终目标挺进！
    这次代表大会是在社会主义的红旗已插上月球、东风压倒西风的国际形势下召开的。匈牙利国内形势也是非常令人欢欣鼓舞的。社会主义工人党在群众中的威信愈来愈高。在党的领导下，全民的团结比过去任何时候都更加坚强了，在工矿部门中劳动竞赛的热潮汹涌澎湃。到目前为止，大多数的工业部门已经提前一年多达到了三年计划规定的主要指标。农业合作化运动在春季大发展后，全国已在50％以上的耕地上实行了社会主义的经营。目前个体农民正纷纷走上社会主义的大道。文艺园地里的鲜花也朵朵盛开。
    这次大会自始至终充满着热烈和谐的气氛，充分显示了党基于马克思列宁主义原则的钢铁般的团结和生动活泼的民主作风。代表们在发言中都一致支持党中央在三年来所执行的政治路线和社会主义建设的方针。许多代表对工作中的缺点也提出了严格的批评。
    三年前，以美国为首的帝国主义集团同匈牙利国内的反革命势力和修正主义分子勾结起来，对匈牙利人民共和国发动了猖狂的进攻。他们企图推翻人民民主政权，突破整个社会主义阵营。在反革命暴乱期间，帝国主义者和修正主义分子曾发出狰狞的笑声，他们以为社会主义的匈牙利已经不存在了。在那决定着祖国和人民命运的危急情况下，优秀的共产党人和爱国者坚定地拿起了武器，在苏军兄弟般的帮助下，粉碎了帝国主义的阴谋，镇压了反革命分子和以纳吉·伊姆雷为首的修正主义叛国集团，捍卫了民族独立、和平和社会主义建设的成果。
    在同反革命斗争的烈火中，匈牙利无产阶级的先锋队，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，清除了修正主义分子，使党的队伍变得空前纯洁和团结一致，无产阶级专政更加巩固了，劳动人民的政治觉悟和警惕性也大大提高了，真是坏事变成了好事。
    代表们在发言中一致谴责了修正主义分子的叛卖行为。他们认为，以纳吉·伊姆雷为首的修正主义分子，从攻击和篡改马克思列宁主义的基本原则、分裂党的团结，到同帝国主义和一切反动势力相勾结、发动反革命暴乱，直到最后被彻底歼灭的整个过程，典型地说明了在国际共产主义运动中修正主义的危险性和它最后灭亡的必然性。
    大会指出：今后要继续同修正主义展开不调和的斗争，绝不容许帝国主义再在匈牙利无产阶级的先锋队里找到他们的代理人。
    基于已取得的经济成就和广大群众劳动热情的空前高涨，大会向全党全民提出了在今后几年内结束社会主义奠基工作的宏伟目标，进一步加快社会主义建设的速度。大会通过的关于制定第二个五年计划的指示，刻划了蓬勃发展的美好前景。到1965年工业生产至少要比1958年的水平提高65％到70％，那时工业生产将相当于1949年的四倍多。工业劳动生产率将提高37％到40％。这就是说，生产增长的三分之二是通过提高劳动生产率来实现的。
    第二个五年计划期间，仅国家的投资额就达一千七百到一千七百五十亿福林。国民收入将比1958年增加50％。在第二个五年计划期间内，将在全国范围内实现农业生产合作化。与此同时，农业生产将得到空前未有的迅速发展。1961—1965年，农业平均产量，将比1954—1958年的平均产量提高30％到32％。五年计划末，化肥的使用量将比现在增加两倍，拖拉机增加一倍半。
    随着生产的发展，人民的生活也将得到进一步的改善。
    来自世界各国的四十六个兄弟党的代表团或代表参加了大会。他们给大会带来千千万万共产党人和劳动者的祝贺，带来社会主义建设和民族解放斗争的胜利消息。他们为匈牙利社会主义工人党高举马克思列宁主义旗帜、领导全国人民粉碎了反革命叛乱而欢呼，为自己的兄弟党取得社会主义建设的巨大成就感到欣慰。
    在大会上致词的兄弟党代表认为，匈牙利人民扑灭反革命暴乱的胜利，不仅拯救了社会主义的匈牙利，而且在国际共产主义运动中也具有重大历史意义。他们还认为，苏联的武装援助，社会主义阵营各国人民和世界和平力量的道义支持，是取得这个胜利的重要因素。三年前在许多国家中掀起的反苏反共逆流和修正主义分子对马克思列宁主义的猖狂进攻，也由于世界无产阶级的坚强团结而被彻底击退。
    帝国主义集团，特别是美帝国主义，并没有接受策动匈牙利反革命暴乱的惨败教训，现在又强迫把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入联大议程。出席这次代表大会的苏共代表团团长赫鲁晓夫和中共代表团团长谭震林等同志，都在向大会致词时严厉谴责了帝国主义者所制造的这个阴谋，认为这是对匈牙利内政的粗暴干涉。
    在大会上发言的兄弟党代表都一致谴责以美国为首的帝国主义集团的战争政策和侵略活动。他们都强调指出，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展，帝国主义者已经无法阻挡殖民地和半殖民地人民争取独立自由的斗争。
    各国兄弟党代表在大会上的致词都充满着国际无产阶级大团结的精神，帝国主义者和修正主义分子分裂社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的企图已经完全破产了。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党代表大会所提出的在今后几年内结束社会主义奠基工作、加速社会主义建设的号召后，获得匈牙利全国人民的热烈响应，他们正在为实现这一伟大的目标而奋斗！
