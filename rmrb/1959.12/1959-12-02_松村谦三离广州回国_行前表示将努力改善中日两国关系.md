Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 1st. Mr. Matsumura Kenzo of Japan and his entourage concluded their visit to our country and departed Guangzhou by train this morning via Shenzhen to return home. Sun Pinghua, director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and others accompanied the guests to Shenzhen.

Those who came to the station to see them off included An Pingsheng, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province; Sun Leyi, Vice Mayor of Guangzhou; Du Guoxiang, Deputy to the National People's Congress; Luo Peiyuan, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; and Feng Naichao, Director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

Matsumura Kenzo had visited Beijing, Lanzhou, Kunming, Chongqing, Wuhan, Shanghai, and other places in our country for more than a month. Yesterday, he arrived in Guangzhou from Hangzhou by special plane. Last night, An Pingsheng, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, hosted a banquet to bid farewell. Vice Governor An Pingsheng spoke at the banquet, hoping that Mr. Matsumura Kenzo would make contributions to promoting the friendship between the people of the two countries and improving relations between China and Japan after returning home.

Mr. Matsumura Kenzo then spoke. He first expressed his great gratitude for the warm reception he received during his visit to China. He mentioned that he had held frank and cordial talks with Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing and had also exchanged views with famous people in Beijing and other places. He believed that although China and Japan have different systems, they can completely join hands and coexist peacefully. He said, "Although there are still many obstacles to achieving this at present, I firmly believe that these obstacles will be overcome in the near future." He said, "I and my entourage will unanimously make our best efforts for this."

Matsumura Kenzo then spoke freely about his impressions after visiting various parts of China. He said, "China's socialist industrial base has been built, and it will develop rapidly in the future." He also said, "After visiting the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project and hearing about the plan to harness the Yellow River, I know that the Yellow River, which has been difficult to clear for a hundred years, will be cleared by the Chinese people within ten years." He believed that the large-scale greening movement currently underway in various places is far greater than building the Great Wall, and from the magnificent aspirations of the Chinese people to build their motherland, he deeply realized the greatness of the Chinese nation. When talking about the People's Communes, he said, "We also visited the People's Communes in various places and learned and observed from many aspects. I am convinced that the People's Communes will surely succeed throughout China." Matsumura Kenzo also praised our country's great achievements in railway construction and the protection of historical relics.

    松村谦三离广州回国
    行前表示将努力改善中日两国关系
    新华社广州1日电　日本松村谦三先生和随行人员结束了在我国的访问，今天上午乘火车离广州经深圳回国。中国人民外交学会理事孙平化等陪同客人到深圳。
    到车站欢送的，有广东省副省长安平生、广州市副市长孙乐宜、全国人民代表大会代表杜国庠、政协广州市委员会副主席罗培元、中国人民外交学会理事冯乃超等。
    松村谦三曾在我国北京、兰州、昆明、重庆、武汉、上海等地作了一个多月的参观访问，昨天乘专机由杭州到达广州。昨晚，广东省副省长安平生设宴欢送。安平生副省长在宴会上讲话，希望松村谦三先生回国后，对促进两国人民的友谊，改进中、日两国的关系作出贡献。
    松村谦三先生接着讲话。他首先对这次在中国访问中受到的热情接待表示非常感激。他谈到了他在北京时，曾经和周恩来总理进行了坦率亲切的交谈，也和北京等地著名人士交换过意见。他认为，中日两国尽管制度不同，但完全可以携起手来，和平共处。他说：“虽然目前要作到这一点还有很多的障碍，但我坚信，这些障碍在不久的将来一定可以克服。”他说：“我和我的随行人员，将一致为此尽最大的努力。”
    松村谦三接着畅谈了这次在中国各地参观访问后的感想。他说：“中国社会主义的工业基础已经建成，今后就会迅速发展。”他还说：“参观了三门峡水利工程和听到治理黄河的计划后，知道百年难清的黄河，中国人民将在十年内使黄河水清。”他认为目前各地进行的大规模绿化运动，要远比修筑万里长城伟大，从中国人民建设祖国宏伟志愿中，又深深地体会到中国民族的伟大。在谈到人民公社时，他说：“我们在各地还参观了人民公社，并从多方进行了解、观察。我确信不疑：人民公社一定能在全中国获得成功。”松村谦三还赞扬了我国的铁路建设和保护历史文物等方面的伟大成就。
