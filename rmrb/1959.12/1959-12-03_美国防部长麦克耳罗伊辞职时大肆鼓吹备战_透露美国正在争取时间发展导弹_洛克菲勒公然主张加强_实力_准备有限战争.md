US Talk of Peace is Pure Posturing
Foreign Aggression Policy Remains Unchanged

Beijing News: Under the smoke screen of "peace," the US government is actively expanding its armaments and preparing for war, especially focusing its efforts on developing missiles, attempting to reverse its backwardness in the missile field. The remarks made by US Defense Secretary McElroy, who resigned on December 1, revealed this fact.

According to reports, McElroy, at a press conference, repeated the myth of "deterrent force," which had long been bankrupt by American warmongers. He said that by 1963, the US would be able to master more means of launching hydrogen warheads to deal with the Soviet Union. In his remarks, McElroy admitted that during his two years in office, the "Atlas" intercontinental missile had become a well-tested weapon. The US is currently "working hard" to deploy this weapon.

He then said that the US is also "making good progress" in developing the "Hound Dog" missile, a 500-mile range missile carried by the B-52 bomber. He also said that during his tenure, the "Polaris" missile system also made significant progress, and this weapon would be available by the end of 1960. The "Minuteman" missile, as the "second generation" intercontinental missile, is expected to be available before 1963. He also predicted that by 1963, the US would have a large number of "Atlas" and "Titan" intercontinental missiles.

McElroy admitted that the US would still lag behind the Soviet Union in missiles for the next three years. He said that before this situation changes, the US must always maintain several American bombers carrying nuclear weapons in the air. McElroy openly stated that "the US government's policy must be to be prepared to use any necessary weapons to achieve our military goals," and that "it would seem to be asking for trouble to adopt any other policy."

McElroy also advocated that "the US should step up its military assistance programs," believing that the money spent on military assistance is "just as important" as the money allocated to US defense.

US President Eisenhower announced on December 1 that he had accepted McElroy's resignation and nominated the current Deputy Secretary of Defense, Thomas Gates Jr., as Secretary of Defense.

According to the "New York Post," New York Governor Rockefeller delivered a speech at a luncheon meeting of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council on November 12, once again advocating escalating the "Cold War," clamoring that "military strength" must be used to support the US in resolving "Cold War" issues with the Soviet Union.

Rockefeller insisted on the US bankrupt policy of "strength." He said that the US should negotiate from a "position of strength," supplementing America's "most powerful retaliatory strike force" with "the vast power to wage limited wars."

Rockefeller opposed summit meetings between heads of state. Speaking at the luncheon, he said, "The weak can only beg, only the strong can conduct real and serious negotiations." Therefore, he believed that the differences between the US and the Soviet Union could not be ended "by a declaration."

Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: New York News: The "New York Times" published an article by Sulzberger on the 25th, admitting that the US government's recent talk of peace was just a posture, and the US aggressive foreign policy had not changed.

Sulzberger pointed out that "it is wrong to say that Herter's policy (towards Moscow) has replaced the old 'Dulles policy'." He said that the US State Department's policy "remains the same," and its current foreign policy "has no substantial difference from the previous policy."

Sulzberger admitted that what has changed is the mood of the American people. He said that after Khrushchev's visit to the United States, "the American people have a growing affection for the Soviet Union," and their understanding of the Soviet Union "has undergone an amazing difference," and now "a new mood of reconciliation has emerged in the country." But he made it very clear: "Mood is not the same as foreign policy." Sulzberger also said that the US is only "more amiable in attitude" towards the Soviet Union diplomatically, and that this "change in the State Department" is "not so obvious." Sulzberger was very uneasy about the rising tide of the American people's desire for peace. He tried his best to spread doubts about the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy, and clamored that the American people's "mood" should not "change too much," and should not fuel the "idea that it is now possible to relax."

In his article, Sulzberger also vigorously advocated that the Western "allies" should step up their arms expansion, fearing that the relaxation of international tensions would cause the "cement" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to "fall off in large chunks."

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: TASS Washington, December 1st: Following the recent failed launch of a lunar rocket by the United States, a series of articles published in American newspapers have emphasized that the United States is far behind the Soviet Union in space research.

"American Weekly" published an article by Lieutenant General Gavin, the former head of the Research and Improvement Department of the US Army Staff, who emphasized that the US needs five years to catch up with the Soviet Union in terms of achievements in space research.

The Washington "Star" published a conversation with a staff member of the National Interstellar and Space Navigation Agency, who said: "When I first started working at the Navigation Agency a year ago, we talked about why we needed a year to catch up (with the Soviet Union). And now we are talking about five years."

At the same time, some of those writing such articles are trying to use the fact that the United States is behind the Soviet Union in space research to stir up war hysteria and actively engage in an arms race. The aforementioned Gavin in the above-mentioned article tried his best to instill in readers the idea that the Soviet Union's achievements in conquering space seem to be a "threat" to the United States. Gavin believes that space is a "strategic place" of a military nature and demands that "the American economy be fully adapted to the current era of space rockets."

Former US Air Force Secretary Finletter also published an article in the "Star," in which he attempted to intimidate American readers with the Soviet Union's achievements in rocket technology. He called for the United States to accelerate the production of bombers and missiles and implement all of its military plans.

The articles by Gavin and Finletter truly echo the pronouncements of such bankrupt "strength" policy advocates as Truman, Acheson, and Rockefeller.

    美国防部长麦克耳罗伊辞职时大肆鼓吹备战
    透露美国正在争取时间发展导弹
    洛克菲勒公然主张加强“实力”准备有限战争
    “纽约时报”载文承认
    美国侈谈和平全属姿态
    对外侵略政策原封未动
    本报讯　美国政府正在“和平”的烟幕下，积极扩军备战，特别是集中力量发展导弹，企图扭转它在导弹方面的落后局面。12月1日辞职的美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊的谈话就露了这个底。
    据报道，麦克耳罗伊在记者招待会上重复美国好战分子早已破了产的“威慑力量”的神话时说，到1963年时，美国将能掌握型式更多的投掷氢弹头的手段来对付苏联。麦克耳罗伊在谈话中供认，在他任职的两年期间，“阿特拉斯式”洲际导弹已成为试验好了的武器。美国目前正在为部署这种武器而“努力”。
    他接着说，美国还在发展“猎狗式”导弹方面“进展得顺利”，这是由B—52型轰炸机携带的一种五百英里射程的导弹。他还说，在他任职的期间内，“北极星式”导弹体系也有重大发展，这种武器在1960年底以前可供使用。作为“第二代”洲际导弹的“民兵式”导弹可望于1963年以前使用。他并且预言说，到1963年时，美国将拥有大量“阿特拉斯式”和“大力神式”的洲际导弹。
    麦克耳罗伊承认美国今后三年内在导弹方面仍将落后于苏联。他说，在这个状况改变前，美国必须时刻保持着有几架载有核武器的美国轰炸机在空中飞行。麦克耳罗伊公开说，“美国政府的政策必须是准备采用任何必需的武器来实现我们的军事目的”，并且认为，“要是采取任何其他政策，看来都将是自找麻烦”。
    麦克耳罗伊还主张“美国应加紧进行军事援助计划”，他认为，花在军事援助上的钱同拨给美国国防方面的钱“同样十分重要”。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔1日宣布，他已接受麦克耳罗伊的辞职，并提名现任国防部副部长小托马斯·盖茨担任国防部长。
    本报讯　据“纽约邮报”报道，纽约州州长洛克菲勒在11月12日洛杉矶世界事务委员会一次午宴会上发表演说，再次鼓吹加剧“冷战”，叫嚣必须以“军事实力”来支持美国同苏联解决“冷战”问题。
    洛克菲勒坚持美国破了产的“实力地位”政策。他说，美国应从“实力地位”出发进行谈判，用“能够进行有限战争的巨大力量”来补充美国的“最强有力的报复性攻击力量”。
    洛克菲勒反对各国首脑举行会谈。他在午宴会上发言说，“弱者只能乞讨，只有强者才能进行真正的和认真的谈判”。因而，他认为美国和苏联之间的分歧不可能“靠一项宣言”来结束。
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”25日刊载苏兹贝格的一篇文章，承认美国政府最近侈谈和平不过是一种姿态，美国侵略性的外交政策并未改变。
    苏兹贝格指出，“如果说赫脱（对莫斯科的）政策已经代替了旧的‘杜勒斯政策’的话，这是错误的”。他说，美国国务院的政策“依旧如故”，它现行的外交政策“同以前的政策并没有实质的差别”。
    苏兹贝格承认，有变化的倒是美国人民的情绪。他说，在赫鲁晓夫访问美国后，“美国人民对苏联抱有越来越大的好感”，他们对苏联的认识“有了惊人的不同”，现在美国“国内出现了一种新的和解的心情”。但是他说得很清楚：“情绪并不等于外交政策”。苏兹贝格还说，美国在外交上对苏联只是“态度比较和蔼”，而且在美国“国务院这种改变”还“不那么明显”。苏兹贝格对于美国人民要求和平的情绪的高涨感到十分不安，他竭力对苏联的和平外交政策散布怀疑，并且叫嚷美国人的“心情”不要“改变太多”，不能助长“认为现在可以放松的主张”。
    苏兹贝格在文章里还大力鼓吹西方的“盟国”要加紧扩充军备，他担心国际紧张局势的缓和使北大西洋公约组织的“水泥”“大块脱落”。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿1日讯：美国最近发射月球火箭再次遭到失败之后，美国报纸发表的一系列文章都强调指出美国在研究宇宙方面大大落后于苏联。
    “美国人周刊”刊登了美国前陆军参谋部研究和改进处的负责人陆军中将加文的一篇文章，他强调指出，美国需要五年的时间才能在宇宙研究的成就方面赶上苏联。
    华盛顿“明星报”刊登了全国星际和空间航行局一个工作人员的谈话，他说：“一年前，我第一次到航行局工作的时候，我们曾经谈过为什么我们需要一年才能赶得上（苏联）。而现在我们谈的是五年。”
    同时，写这种文章的某些人企图利用美国在宇宙研究方面落后于苏联的事实来挑起战争狂热和积极进行军备竞赛。上面提到过的加文中将在上述文章中竭力向读者灌输这样一种说法，说苏联在征服宇宙空间方面的成就似乎是对美国的一种“威胁”。加文认为宇宙是具有军事性质的一个“战略场所”，并且要求使“美国的经济完全适应于目前宇宙火箭的时代”。
    美国前空军部长芬勒特也在“明星报”上发表文章，他企图以苏联在火箭技术方面的成就恫吓美国读者。他要求美国加速生产轰炸机和导弹，并贯彻实行美国全部的军事计划。
    加文和芬勒特的文章同杜鲁门、艾奇逊和洛克菲勒这样一些早已破产了的“实力地位”政策鼓吹者的言论真是一唱一和。
