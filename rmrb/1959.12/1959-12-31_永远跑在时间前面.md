　　Always Run Ahead of Time
　　Wèi Gāohòu, National Advanced Producer, Milling Worker of Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory
　　1959 was a year of continued leap forward in China's production and construction. This year, under the Party's kind education and with the enthusiastic help of my comrades, my work has also taken a step forward. In one year, I implemented a total of 615 innovation proposals, solved 91 major key problems, and saved an average of 5,000 yuan of wealth for the country every day. This little achievement is far from enough for a Communist Party member, because the task assigned to us by the Party is to change the "poor and blank" face of the motherland. In the future, I will work more, faster, better, and more economically. In this era where one day equals twenty years, time is more precious than gold. I will always run ahead of time, making one year do the work of several.
　　1960 is coming, and it will be a new year of leap forward. In 1960, our factory will achieve a continued leap forward without increasing a single person or machine. I will also start with technological innovation, making the machine tool I operate perform the work of three, and complete eight years of work in this new year. Because I understand that the human brain is not like a machine; a machine always has a maximum load, while the human brain has no "limit." You can use it as much as you want, and the more you use it, the better it becomes. Technological innovation is also a "bottomless pit," and the more tricks you find, the more there are. I plan to implement 750 innovation proposals in this new year. On the first day of work in the new year, I will implement five innovations, complete the task for January in seven days, and complete the task for the first quarter by January 18th.
　　The Party has repeatedly taught us that we should not only maintain the glory of being advanced but also promote the communist spirit, helping our companions with full enthusiasm and sincerity, imparting our advanced experience without reservation, and helping other units and individuals to rise to an advanced level. I will spread the 96 advanced technical experiences I learned at the National "Congress of Heroes" in the shortest possible time, so that all workers in the factory can master them according to their different jobs. I will work hand in hand with the comrades in the workshop and team, and help 150 comrades to leap into the ranks of the advanced.
　　In 1960, I will also strive to improve my political and cultural level. This year, I will systematically study philosophy to better master revolutionary principles, better understand and implement the Party's resolutions and policies, be a good and obedient tool of the Party, and work with my fellow workers across the country to achieve new victories in the new battle!

　　永远跑在时间前面
    全国先进生产者重庆长安机器厂铣工  魏高厚
    1959年是我国生产建设继续跃进的一年。这一年，我在党的亲切教育下，同时得到同志们的热情帮助，工作也向前迈进了一步。一年的时间，我一共实现了六百一十五件革新建议，解决重大关键问题九十一个，平均每天为国家节约五千元的财富。这点成绩，对于一个共产党员说来，那是很不够的，因为党交给我们的任务是要改变祖国“一穷二白”的面貌。今后我要工作得更多、更快、更好、更省。在这一天等于二十年的时代里，时间比金子还贵重，我要永远跑在时间前面，让一年当几年用。
    1960年就要来到了，这是新的跃进的一年。1960年，我们厂要在不增加一个人，不增加一部机器的情况下实现继续跃进。我也要从革新技术着手，让我操作的机床一部当三部用，在这新的一年中完成八年的工作量。因为我懂得：人脑子不像机器，机器总有个最大负荷，而人的脑子没有什么“极限”，你要怎么用就怎么用，而且是越用越好用；技术革新也是个“无底洞”，窍门越找越多。我打算在这新的一年中实现革新建议七百五十项。新年上班头一天，就实现五项革新，1月份的任务七天完成，第一季度的任务在1月18日完成。
    党一再教导我们：不仅要保持先进的光荣，而且要发扬共产主义风格，满腔热情地、诚心诚意地帮助自己的同伴，毫无保留地传授自己的先进经验，帮助别的单位和别人提高到先进水平。我要把在全国“群英会”上学到的九十六种先进技术经验，在最短时间内传播开去，让全厂的工人同志按不同的工种分别掌握。我要同车间、小组的同志携手前进，并帮助一百五十位同志跃入先进行列。
    在1960年，我还要努力提高政治、文化水平。这一年，我要系统学完哲学，以便更好地掌握革命道理，更好地领会、理解、贯彻党的决议、政策，当好党的驯服工具，同全国工人弟兄一道，在新的战斗中获得新的胜利！
