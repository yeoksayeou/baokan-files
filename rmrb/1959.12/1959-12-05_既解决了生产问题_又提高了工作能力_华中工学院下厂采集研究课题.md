Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 4th: Scientific research activities are very active among teachers and students at Huazhong Institute of Technology. Many teachers and students from various departments are going to factories to collect problems in production for scientific research, enthusiastically serving industrial production and construction. Teachers and students from various departments, who are fully collaborating with Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation and Daye Steel Plant, have formed working groups and gone to factories to collect research topics. In Wuhan Iron and Steel alone, they have collected more than two hundred research topics. For some urgent production problems, they organize forces to conduct research and solve them on the spot. The Department of Mechanical Engineering has specially formed a group to go deep into small and medium-sized mechanical and electrical factories in Wuhan to assist in technological innovation. In the laboratories and factories of the institute, various scientific research works are being carried out intensively. For example, the Department of Mechanical Engineering is accelerating the research work of establishing an automated workshop; the Department of Electrical Engineering is striving to adjust the successfully trial-produced AC calculation table as soon as possible to serve the production of hydropower stations.
The school's Party organization attaches great importance to the leadership of scientific research work, and adheres to the correct direction of scientific research serving production and engaging in large-scale collaboration. From the Party Secretary to the responsible cadres of Party organizations at all levels, they often take the lead in going deep into reality, and do their best to help solve the difficulties and problems in scientific research work. Under the leadership and attention of the Party, the enthusiasm of all teachers and students in the institute is high, and they are full of energy, taking pride in being able to contribute to the great leap forward in production. They have adopted various forms to establish extensive collaboration with factories. These forms are roughly as follows: The first is to contract research projects proposed by relevant units. The second is to collaborate with factory enterprise departments. They have carried out collaboration with hundreds of factories and enterprises related to machinery, electrical instruments, metallurgy, power, etc. in eleven provinces and sixteen cities. The third is to deliver technology to the door. Since the second half of last year, the school has established a technical guidance group, sending more than 1,000 teachers and students to various special districts in Hubei Province and neighboring provinces to provide technical guidance for the newly established machinery and steel industries in various places. The fourth is to change all graduates' graduation designs into combining production labor and scientific research, solving thousands of technical problems for factories and enterprises.
After the development of scientific research work, it has not only solved production problems, but also enabled students to master rich knowledge and improve their independent working ability. Through going deep into reality and participating in scientific research activities, teachers have also increased their production knowledge, enriched the teaching content, and explained the courses more vividly and thoroughly.

    既解决了生产问题　又提高了工作能力
    华中工学院下厂采集研究课题
    据新华社武汉4日电　华中工学院师生科学研究活动十分活跃。许多专业的师生纷纷下厂收集生产中的问题进行科学研究，热情地为工业生产建设服务。同武汉钢铁公司、大冶钢厂全面协作的各个专业的师生，成立了工作组，下厂采集研究课题，仅在武钢就采集了各种研究课题二百多个。对一些生产中迫切需要解决的问题，他们就组织力量，就地进行研究和解决。机械系专门成立小组，深入到武汉市中小型机电工厂里，协助进行技术革新工作。在学院的实验室、工厂里，各项科学研究工作正在紧张进行着。如机械系正在加速进行建立自动化车间的研究工作；电机系正力争在最近把试制成功的交流计算台调整好，以便为水电站的生产服务。
    学校党组织很重视对科学研究工作的领导，坚持科学研究必须为生产服务、大搞协作的正确方向。从党委书记到各级党组织的负责干部都经常带头深入实际，尽力帮助解决科学研究工作中的困难和问题。在党的领导和重视下，全院师生情绪高涨，干劲十足，都以能为生产大跃进贡献一分力量为光荣。他们采取多种多样形式同工厂建立广泛的协作。这些形式大约有以下几种：第一种是承包有关单位提出的研究项目。第二种是同工厂企业部门协作。他们已与十一个省和十六个市的有关机械、电机仪表、冶金、动力等方面的数百个工厂企业开展协作。第三种是把技术送上门去。去年下半年起，学校就成立技术辅导团，派出一千多名师生到湖北省各专区及邻近省分，对各地新办的机械、钢铁工业进行技术辅导工作。第四种是把毕业生的毕业设计全部改成结合生产劳动、科学研究进行，为工厂企业解决了成千个技术问题。
    科学研究工作开展后，既解决了生产问题，又使学生掌握了丰富的知识，提高了学生的独立工作能力。教师们通过深入实际和参加科学研究活动，也增加了生产知识，充实了教学内容，把课程讲解得更加生动透彻。
