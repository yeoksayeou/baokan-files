Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Jiangsu Province, after the basic completion of autumn harvesting and planting, immediately launched a massive winter plowing and deep turning movement. After more than a month of hard work, winter fallow land throughout the province has been basically plowed once, and most areas are plowing and harrowing a second and third time.

This year, Party committees at all levels have taken winter plowing as an important task. In the Xuhuai area, which has the largest winter plowing task, not a single stubble of winter fallow land was left, and the plowing depth of ordinary fields reached four to five inches, and basic fields eight inches to one foot.

The specifications and standards for winter plowing and deep turning in various places are closely combined with the spring sowing layout for next year. In the large-scale deep turning in Siyang County, different forms such as intercropping with large and small rows are adopted according to crop layout and soil quality, so as to reasonably use manpower and animal power. This saved labor, accelerated progress, and also facilitated layered fertilization.

At present, the Xuhuai area is carrying out deep plowing on the basis of the first winter plowing, combined with applying base fertilizer and land preparation. In the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu's rice-growing region, more than ten counties including Xinghua, Gaoyou, and Yancheng have not only plowed three or four times, but also raised the management of paddy fields to the same important position as wheat field management. Yancheng County, with 500,000 mu of paddy fields, has organized special personnel to carry out winter plowing, irrigation, weeding, and base fertilizer application.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi: Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has overfulfilled this year's wasteland reclamation plan. The region has reclaimed 5,310,000 mu of wasteland, exceeding the plan by 310,000 mu. While reclaiming wasteland, various places have vigorously grasped farmland water conservancy and land leveling, so that the newly reclaimed wasteland has irrigation facilities. At present, more than 2 million mu of the newly reclaimed wasteland has been planted with winter wheat, and the rest will be sown next spring.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, December 21: After more than a month of efforts, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has made great achievements in winter wheat field management. According to inspections in various places, the number of winter wheat seedlings is generally around 350,000 plants per mu, and first and second-class seedlings account for about 80% to 90%. At present, communes in the Tarim Basin and Turpan Basin are rushing to harrow and compact the soil to prevent moisture loss and soil cracking, and applying "mengtou fen" (manure applied to the top of the seedlings) and covering with fine soil to ensure that millions of mu of wheat are not damaged by frost. In the northern Tianshan area, where snow covers the ground, communes are transporting large amounts of fertilizer to the fields, preparing to topdress the wheat seedlings when they turn green in the spring, and at the same time dispatching part of the labor force to remove weeds from the edges of the fields to eliminate overwintering pests.

Xinjiang's winter wheat field management this year has been grasped early, grasped firmly, and grasped meticulously. Seedling inspection and replanting were carried out as soon as the wheat seedlings emerged, and then winter irrigation, pest and disease control, and topdressing with winter fertilizer were carried out in a timely manner. Winter irrigation started in full swing around the time of Cold Dew, with fast progress and good quality. At present, except for some wheat fields that are not suitable for irrigation due to high groundwater levels or low-lying terrain, all areas of the autonomous region have been irrigated once. Sandy and Gobi land with rapid infiltration and poor water retention has generally been irrigated twice.

In previous years, the prevention and control of pests and diseases such as aphids, cutworms, and rust, which seriously harm wheat seedlings, only started after the beginning of spring. This year, people's communes took action in advance and resolutely eliminated these pests and diseases before overwintering. After two months of fierce and skillful fighting, as of December 15, the area where pests and diseases have been eliminated has reached 96.6% of the area where they occurred.

Under the slogan of "First-class seedlings ride the wind and waves, second-class seedlings keep up closely, and third-class seedlings upgrade ahead of schedule," various places have organized topdressing teams to rush to apply winter fertilizer. Many people's communes have classified and ranked wheat seedlings, and prescribed the right medicine for the symptoms. Sheep manure is applied to alkaline soil, and grassy mud is applied to black soil. The amount of topdressing is generally 3,000 to 4,000 jin of high-quality fertilizer per mu. At present, the movement to accumulate and apply fertilizer is still actively underway throughout the autonomous region.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: Under the slogan of "Don't let silt flow to the Sanmenxia Dam," the people in the mountainous areas of Shanxi Province have been universally carrying out a soil and water conservation movement from north to south since the end of October. In just over a month, a large amount of soil erosion area has been initially controlled.

This year, soil and water conservation work in Shanxi Province focuses on the Yellow River Basin and the upper reaches of reservoirs. In order to increase grain production in mountainous areas, the province has newly built 3.2 million mu of terraced fields in the vast hilly and mountainous areas, and 6.77 million mu of cultivated land in mountainous areas has been cultivated with field ridges. All localities have combined engineering control with biological measures such as afforestation and grass planting. The province has planted 5.92 million mu of soil and water conservation forests and 1.18 million mu of pasture. Because counties and communes have a focus on centralized, comprehensive, and integrated management, the progress of gully engineering is also very fast. The province has built more than 28,600 dams and more than 320,000 valley weirs. At the same time, existing projects are consolidated and renovated with emphasis. The area of various projects that have been renovated and consolidated in the province has reached 3.39 million mu.

In the Yellow River Basin and the upper reaches of various reservoirs, a high-standard management movement with the main contents of turning slopes into terraced fields, gullies into platforms, cultivated land into irrigated land, and mountainous areas into gardens has been universally launched. Zhongyang County in Jinzhong District organized county-wide cooperation to manage the Nanchuan River Basin. It has newly built 280,000 mu of terraced fields. Together with the terraced fields built last year, the county has an average of 3 mu of terraced fields per person. The county has also afforested 178,000 mu. Together with various projects over the years, the county has controlled a total of 1.82 million mu of soil erosion area, accounting for 95% of the county's soil erosion area. Now, the mountain slopes and cultivated land on both the east and west banks of the Nanchuan River have become terraces, and barren mountains have been planted with seedlings of various trees. The entire basin has taken on a new look.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan: Winter irrigation work on the Yinchuan Plain in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has ended, and some places in the southern mountainous areas are in tense progress.

This year's winter irrigation work in the Ningxia area has been progressing rapidly due to early preparation and early action. Because the winter irrigation work is combined with the work of cultivating land, leveling fields, and developing garden-like fields, the quality of winter irrigation is also very good. In previous years, because land cultivation could not keep up with winter irrigation, a large part of the land was irrigated without being plowed, so that a large amount of water flowed over the surface of the land and could not penetrate the soil layer. This year, after the autumn harvest, people's communes rushed to cultivate and level the land, so that more than 3 million mu of plowed land were irrigated in time, ensuring the quality of winter irrigation. The universal leveling of fields and the development of garden-like fields by people's communes have also prevented large-scale flooding and greatly improved the utilization rate of water. In Guyuan, Tongxin and other counties in the southern mountainous area, due to the newly built and renovated more than 1,000 canals and the newly built six reservoirs, the winter irrigation area has increased by more than two times compared with last year.

People's communes in various places have also universally carried out harrowing and compaction work on the cultivated land that has been winter-irrigated, correcting the soil compaction and moisture loss caused by not harrowing and compacting in the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: Gansu Province has improved more than 1.1 million mu of low-yielding land this winter in conjunction with the construction of water conservancy and soil and water conservation.

Gansu Province has about 9 million mu of low-yielding land. Since the beginning of this year, a mass movement focusing on improving low-yielding land has been launched in the eastern mountainous area, the central Loess Plateau, and the Hexi Corridor. Counties in the Hexi Corridor, where saline-alkali land is most harmful, have focused on improving 170,000 mu of low-yielding saline-alkali land through measures such as opening ditches for drainage, leveling fields, suppressing saline-alkali, and laying sand. The people of all ethnic groups in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture have adopted methods such as building terraced fields and cultivating field ridges in arid areas, combined with increasing the application of organic fertilizer and deepening the cultivated layer to improve white soil; they have adopted methods such as paving sand, applying more organic fertilizer, and cultivating and grinding multiple times to improve alkaline soil in low-lying areas; and they have adopted methods such as applying more organic fertilizer, combined with leveling fields and cultivating field ridges to maintain water and soil, to improve red soil and "yaofen" soil in mountainous areas; and people's communes in Wudu County in the eastern mountainous area have vigorously adopted methods such as paving sand, building dams, and silting in cotton fields to improve the soil.

　　翻地·改土·积肥·冬灌·开荒
    冬季生产热气腾腾
    江苏冬闲地已耕翻一遍
    据新华社南京讯　江苏省在秋收秋种基本结束以后，立即掀起了一个声势浩大的冬耕深翻运动。经过一个多月的奋战，全省冬闲地已基本冬耕一遍，大部分地区正在耕耖二遍和三遍。
    今年，各级党委都把冬耕工作作为一项重要任务来抓。冬耕任务最大的徐淮地区，冬闲田没有留一分板茬，耕翻深度一般田达四至五寸，基本田八寸至一尺。
    各地冬耕深翻的规格标准都与明年春播布局紧密的结合。泗阳县在大面积深翻中，根据作物布局、土质，采用大小行间作等不同形式，合理地使用人力和畜力。节省了劳力，加快了进度，而且便于分层施肥。
    目前，徐淮地区正在已冬耕一遍的基础上搞深翻，并结合施基肥和整地。苏北水稻区里下河地带兴化、高邮、盐城等十多个县的沤水田，不但已耕三、四遍，而且把水田管理提高到与麦田管理一样重要的位置。盐城县五十万亩水田，组织了专人进行冬耕、灌水、除草、施基肥等工作。
    新疆开荒造田五百万亩冬麦管理又早又快又好
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆维吾尔自治区各地超额完成了今年的开荒计划。全区已开荒造田五百三十一万亩，超过计划三十一万亩。各地在开荒造田的同时，大抓农田水利和平整土地，使新开的荒地都有了灌溉设施。现在，新开荒地中已有二百多万亩种上了冬麦，其余的将在明春播种。
    新华社乌鲁木齐21日电　经过一个多月的努力，新疆维吾尔自治区冬麦田间管理工作已取得很大成绩。据各地检查，冬麦保苗每亩一般在三十五万株左右，一、二类苗达到80％到90％左右。现在，塔里木盆地和吐鲁番盆地各公社正突击耙磨镇压，防止跑墒和土地龟裂，并给麦苗施蒙头粪，盖细土，保证几百万亩小麦不受冻害。在瑞雪盖地的天山北部地区，各公社正在把大量的肥料送往地头，准备明春麦苗返青时追施，同时出动一部分劳力，在田边地角清除杂草，以消灭潜伏越冬害虫。
    新疆今年的冬麦田间管理工作抓得早，抓得狠，抓得细。麦苗刚露土就进行了查苗补苗，以后又及时进行冬灌、防治病虫害和追施越冬肥。冬灌在寒露前后就全面开始，进度快，质量好。目前，全自治区除一部分麦田因地下水位高或地势低洼不宜灌溉外，都浇了一次水，渗水快、保水差的沙土地、戈壁地一般都浇水两次。
    往年，对严重危害麦苗的蚜虫、地老虎、锈病等病虫害的防治，都是在开春以后才开始，今年各人民公社提前动手，坚决把这些病虫消灭在越冬之前。经两个月的猛攻巧打，截止12月15日，消灭病虫害的面积已达发生面积的96.6％。
    在“一类苗乘风破浪，二类苗紧紧跟上，三类苗提前升级”的口号下，各地都组织追肥队突击追施越冬肥。许多人民公社对麦苗作了分类排队，对症下药，碱性土壤施羊粪，黑壤土施草泥土，追肥量一般为每亩优质肥三千至四千斤。目前，全自治区的积肥施肥运动还在积极展开。
　　山西普遍开展水土保持运动
    据新华社太原讯　山西省山区人民在“不让泥沙流到三门峡”的口号下，从10月下旬开始，由北到南地普遍开展水土保持运动，一个多月已初步治理了大量的水土流失面积。
    今年山西省的水土保持工作以黄河流域和水库上游为重点。为了提高山地的粮食产量，全省已在广大丘陵山区新修水田梯田三百二十万亩，并且有六百七十七万亩山垣地区的耕地垦修了地埂。各地都结合工程治理，大抓造林、种草等生物措施，全省已营造水土保持林五百九十二万亩，种植牧草一百一十八万多亩。由于县县社社都有集中、全面、综合治理的重点，因此沟壑工程进度也很快，全省已打坝两万八千六百多道，筑谷坊三十二万多座。同时，有重点地巩固和整修原有工程。全省经过整修和巩固的各项工程面积，已有三百三十九万亩。
    在黄河流域和各个水库上游地区，普遍开展了以坡地梯田化，沟壑川台化，耕地水利化和山区园林化为主要内容的高标准治理运动。晋中区的中阳县，组织全县协作，治理南川河流域，已新修梯田二十八万亩，连同去年修成的梯田，全县每人平均已有梯田三亩；全县还造林十七万八千亩。连同历年的各项工程，这个县共已治理水土流失面积一百八十二万亩，占到全县水土流失面积的95％。现在南川河东西两岸的山坡耕地都已变成一台台平整的梯田，荒山都已种植了各种林木的幼苗，整个流域已经面貌一新。
    宁夏结合深翻整地进行冬灌
    据新华社银川讯　宁夏回族自治区银川平原冬灌工作已经结束，南部山区有些地方正在紧张进行。
    今年宁夏地区的冬灌工作，由于准备早和行动早，进展很快，并由于把冬灌工作和耕地、平田、大搞园田化等工作结合起来进行，所以冬灌质量也很好。往年因为耕地赶不上冬灌，所以有大部分土地没有经过耕翻就灌上了水，使大量的水沿地表面流过而不能渗入土层。今年秋收结束后，各人民公社就突击耕地和平整土地，使三百多万亩翻过的土地都及时灌上了冬水，保证了冬灌的质量。各人民公社普遍平田整地和大搞园田化的结果，还防止大水漫灌现象，大大提高了水的利用率。南部山区的固原、同心等县，由于新修和整修了一千多条渠道和新修了六个水库，冬灌面积比去年增加了两倍多。
    各地人民公社对已经冬灌过的耕地，还普遍地进行了耙耱镇压工作，纠正了以往不耙耱镇压而造成的土壤板结和跑墒现象。
    甘肃一百多万亩低产地得到改良
    据新华社兰州讯　甘肃省结合兴修水利和水土保持，今冬已改良低产地一百一十多万亩。
    甘肃省低产地约九百多万亩。今年以来，在东部山区、中部黄土高原和河西走廊上掀起了重点改良低产地的群众运动。盐碱地危害最大的河西走廊各县，通过开沟排水、平田整地、冲压盐碱、铺沙压碱等措施，重点改良了低产盐碱地十七万亩。临夏回族自治州的各族人民，在干旱地区采用修梯田、培地埂，结合增施有机肥料与加深耕层的方法改良白土；洼地采用铺砂、多施有机肥料及多次耕磨的方法改良碱土；在山阴地区采用多施有机肥料为主，结合平田整地、培地埂保持水土的方法，改良红土和鹞粪土；东部山区的武都县各人民公社在棉花地内大力采用铺沙、打坝、淤泥等办法改良土壤。
