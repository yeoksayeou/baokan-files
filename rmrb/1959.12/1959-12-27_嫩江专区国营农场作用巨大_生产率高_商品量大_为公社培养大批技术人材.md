　　Nenjiang Prefecture State-Run Farms Play a Huge Role
    High Productivity, Large Commodity Volume, Cultivating a Large Number of Technical Talents for Communes
    (Our dispatch) The state-run farm (livestock) complex in Nenjiang Prefecture, Heilongjiang Province, consisting of seventy-four farms and ranches, has become a powerful base for the state to carry out agricultural technical transformation locally and an important commodity base for agricultural and livestock products. The state-run farm complex in Nenjiang Prefecture is an important part of the state-run farm complex in Heilongjiang Province. The total cultivated land area of this farm complex in the prefecture is more than 4.4 million mu, with five large-scale mechanized grain farms with more than 200,000 mu of cultivated land, and four large-scale mechanized livestock farms. Zhao Guang Farm (formerly Tongbei Farm), China's first mechanized farm, cultivated 350,000 mu of land this year, while the "September 3rd" Veterans Farm is more than twice as large as Zhao Guang Farm, with a cultivated area of 767,000 mu. The Red Prairie Ranch spans tens of thousands of square miles, and the Binzhou Railway Line passes through this ranch, with five stations set up along the way.
    The Nenjiang Prefecture state-run farm complex, which has been in operation for twelve years, demonstrates the great significance of using modern mechanized farm implements for agricultural technical transformation with its outstanding labor productivity. The farms in the entire area are equipped with two thousand standard tractors, five hundred large-scale harvesters and threshers, one hundred and seventy-four trucks, and tens of thousands of various machine farm tools. These facilities ensure that each farm and ranch worker cultivates 70 mu of land, producing more than 888.8 million jin of grain for the state this year, with an average yield of more than 200 jin per mu. On average, each farm worker produces more than 14,000 jin of grain per year. And Zhao Guang Farm produces an average of more than 39,000 jin per person. The third production team of the Heping Branch of this farm produces an average of more than 100,700 jin of grain per person, and the grain produced by one person can feed 200 people. From spring planting to autumn harvest, most of the farming on the grain farms has been mechanized; the modern equipment of the livestock farms has long attracted the attention of local farmers. The Xin Sheng Collective Farm is located near the "September 3rd" Veterans Farm, and it was organized in this way, becoming one of the earliest established advanced agricultural cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province. After the people's communeization, the situation of large-scale technical transformation of agriculture has taken shape, and the farms and ranches have further become the "base camp" and technical schools for agricultural technical transformation. The farms and ranches in the entire prefecture have a total of six schools and training classes specifically for training technical personnel for the communes, with more than a thousand farmers studying in each session. The technical force cultivated by the farms for the rural people's communes in the entire region, including tractor drivers, inseminators, and livestock workers, totals more than 2,500 people. They are all the technical backbones of the communes. In recent years, the improved seeds propagated and promoted by the farms have made all wheat and soybeans in the entire region improved varieties. Every year during the production season, a large number of farmers visit the farms to learn various production techniques. In recent years, the farms in this prefecture have transferred more than 4,700 technical personnel and management cadres to other places.
    The state-run farm complex in Nenjiang Prefecture is known as the national commodity base or "living warehouse" because of the large quantity and high rate of commodities it produces, and because it absolutely obeys the needs of the state, while also allowing the state to obtain large profits. The cultivated land of the farms in the entire region accounts for only a little more than 13% of the cultivated land in the prefecture, but the marketable grain sold to the state this year accounts for more than 20% of the entire prefecture. For large grain farms, 76 jin out of every 100 jin of grain produced is marketable grain. The commodities sold by the farms are all wheat, soybeans, pork, milk, wool, and eggs with higher value. The "September 3rd" Veterans Farm sold 70 million jin of wheat to the state this year, which is more than the total amount of wheat sold to the state by all the farmers in an ordinary county. In the past two years, in the case of large-scale seed retention and propagation, the farms and ranches have sold 1.5 million jin of pork, 22 million jin of milk, 180,000 jin of wool, and 200,000 jin of eggs to the state.
    The state-run farm complex in Nenjiang Prefecture made a profit this year, totaling more than 24 million yuan for the state. As state commodity bases, the farms and ranches first operate and produce according to the needs of the state. This year, all farms planted barley. According to market prices, planting one mu of barley would result in 6 to 7 yuan less income than wheat, but the state required ensuring the raw materials for beer production, so Zhao Guang Farm planted 22,500 mu of barley, and the "September 3rd" Veterans Farm planted 36,000 mu. Yarsei Farm, which mainly produces non-staple foods, had a bumper harvest of summer vegetables this year. When a large amount of vegetables from various communes flooded the market, the state ordered Yarsei Farm to properly store the summer vegetables, reduce the amount of vegetables sold, and then transfer them out in large quantities when the amount of vegetables on the market decreased, so as to balance the market supply.

　　嫩江专区国营农场作用巨大
    生产率高　商品量大　为公社培养大批技术人材
    本报讯　黑龙江省嫩江专区由七十四处农场、牧场形成的国营农（牧）场群，已经成为国家在当地进行农业技术改造的强大阵地和重要的农产、畜产商品基地。嫩江专区的国营农场群是黑龙江省的国营农场群的重要组成部分。这个专区农场群的耕地总面积达四百四十多万亩，耕地在二十万亩以上的大型机械谷物农场五处，大型机械畜牧农场四处。我国第一个机械农场——赵光农场（原名通北农场），今年种地三十五万亩，而“九三”荣军农场又比赵光农场大一倍还多，耕地面积达七十六万七千亩。红色草原牧场纵横一万几千平方里，滨州线铁路穿过这个牧场，就设了五个车站。
    先后已经有十二年经营历史的嫩江专区国营农场群，以突出的劳动生产率说明了用现代化的机器农具的装备进行农业技术改造的巨大意义。全区农场配备两千标准台拖拉机，五百台大型收割机和脱谷机，一百七十四辆载重汽车，成万件的各种机器农具。这些设备保证了农、牧场职工每人种地七十亩，今年为国家生产了八亿八千八百多万斤粮食，平均亩产二百斤以上。农场职工平均每人一年生产粮食一万四千多斤。而赵光农场平均每人生产三万九千多斤。这个农场的和平分场第三生产队，平均每人生产十万零七百多斤粮食，一个人生产的粮食可以供二百人食用。谷物农场从春播到秋收，绝大部分耕作都已经机械化；畜牧农场的现代化设备，早已经吸引住当地农民的注意力。新生集体农庄靠近“九三”荣军农场，它就是这样组织起来的，成为黑龙江省最早建立的高级社之一。人民公社化以后，农业进行大规模的技术改造的形势已经形成，农、牧场进一步成为农业技术改造的“大本营”和技术学校。全专区农、牧场共设有六处专门为公社培养技术人材的学校和训练班，每期就学的农民都在千人以上。全区农村人民公社由农场代为培养成长的技术力量，包括拖拉机手和配种员、畜牧员等，共有两千五百多人。他们都是公社的技术骨干。几年来农场繁殖推广的优良种子，使全区小麦、大豆全部良种化。每年生产季节，大批农民到农场参观、学习各种生产技术。这个专区的农场几年来向外地输送技术人材和管理干部四千七百多人。
    嫩江专区的国营农场群被称为国家的商品基地或“活仓库”，是因为它们生产的商品量大，商品率高，而且绝对服从国家的需要，同时又使国家获得大量的利润。全区农场耕地占这个专区的耕地13％多一点，而今年交售给国家的商品粮，却占全专区20％以上。大谷物农场，每生产一百斤粮食，就有七十六斤是商品粮。农场出售的商品都是价值较高的小麦、大豆、猪肉、牛奶、羊毛和鸡蛋。“九三”荣军农场今年出售给国家的小麦就有七千万斤，比一个普通县全县农民卖给国家的小麦还多。农、牧场近两年在大量留种繁殖的情况下，出售给国家一百五十万斤猪肉、两千二百万斤牛奶、十八万斤羊毛、二十万斤鸡蛋。
    嫩江专区的国营农场群今年场场盈利，共计可以使国家获得利润两千四百多万元。作为国家商品基地的农、牧场，首先是按国家需要经营生产。今年各农场都种了大麦，按市价，种一亩大麦要比小麦少收入六元到七元，可是国家要求保证啤酒的生产原料，赵光农场就种了两万二千五百亩大麦，“九三”荣军农场种了三万六千亩。以副食品生产为主的雅尔塞农场，今年夏菜丰收，当各公社的蔬菜大量拥入市场，国家又指令雅尔塞农场妥善保管夏菜，减少出场量，等蔬菜上市量减少时，再大批调出，平衡市场供应。　（李万义）（附图片）
