Direction of Major Technological Innovation and Revolution in Large Enterprises
    A Batch of Automatic Production Lines Appear in Harbin
    Automatic Production Lines Successfully Tested by Dalian Machine Tool Plant and Luoyang Bearing Plant Increase Production Efficiency by 70% to Six Times

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 28th: In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, a number of modern large-scale enterprises in Harbin have built many automated continuous production lines. The emergence of these automated production lines has shattered the mistaken notion held by some in the past that modern enterprises cannot engage in technological innovation, and has opened up a path for modern enterprises to carry out technological innovation and technological revolution.

    The automatic production lines built by a number of large enterprises in Harbin are based on the original equipment, reforming and reorganizing individual automated machines or mechanized equipment, and adding devices such as conveyor belts to connect them into a group of automated continuous production machines. Workers only need to adjust the machines at the beginning of production to enable this group of machines to automatically and continuously complete all or several processing steps of a certain part.

    Adopting this method for production, factories not only fully utilize the potential of the equipment, save machine tools, and increase the utilization rate of production sites, but also greatly increase labor productivity, ensure product quality, and further achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. Employees of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory transformed machines for processing "hand taps" into fully automated ones, and connected them with automatic conveyor belts to form a "cold-processing automatic line for taps." During production, workers load materials from the first machine and, after continuous processing by six machine tools, produce cold-processed finished products. In the past, the production of taps involved processing on seven machines, each machine being an independent process operated by one worker, requiring a total of seven workers per shift; now, only two workers are needed to monitor the operation of the machines, saving five workers. In the past, cutting and stamping were performed as two separate processes on two machines; now, workers install cutting and stamping tools on one machine, combining the two processes on one machine simultaneously, saving one machine tool, reducing the area of the production site, and improving processing efficiency. In the past, for each process, workers needed to take the processing task to the machine and then take it off after processing, resulting in a relatively long non-production time; now, six machines continuously process, reducing non-production time. At the same time, the processing efficiency of the machines has generally improved after the transformation. According to factory calculations, after being connected into an automatic production line, the output of taps has increased by more than seven times, and labor productivity has increased by twelve times. The Harbin Bearing Factory adjusted the positions of the original three machine tools and connected them with automatic conveying mechanisms to form an automatic production line for rough grinding of long beads, increasing production efficiency by 50% and also reducing three workers.

    In the past, mechanical workers had to rely on craftsmanship to ensure product quality during production. Now, on the automatic production line, the product is completely automatically processed by machines, and workers can control the output and quality of the product by simply relying on indicator lights and instruments. Therefore, the product qualification rate has also greatly increased. After the soft shaft rocker production automatic line of Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory was put into production, the product qualification rate increased by 30%.

    The automatic production line also creates good working conditions for the workers. In the past, one worker managed one machine tool, and the eyes had to be fixed on the processing object during operation, and the loading, unloading, and transportation of products between upper and lower processes were also frequent; now, workers can sit in front of the console and supervise the work of groups of machines, greatly reducing the intensity of labor. The workers said happily: "In the past, we thought that the equipment in our factory was brand new, and no matter how hard we tried, we couldn't change anything. Now it seems that there are still many places that can be reformed!" So far, a total of twenty-five automatic production lines have been put into production in the city, and more than eighty are still under research and testing.

    The fundamental experience of Harbin's modern large factories in building automatic production lines is to adhere to putting politics in command and resolutely implement the idea of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. In the past, some cadres in some modern factories believed that technological innovation and technological revolution were matters for small and old factories, and that large and new factories had good equipment and high production levels, so there was no need to carry out any more innovation. The Party committees of various factories took ideological revolution as the prerequisite for technological revolution, and first conducted education among cadres to eliminate ideological obstacles and enhance the confidence of personnel participating in design and manufacturing. As a result, the first automatic production line was born in the large and new Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory.

    This newspaper reports that the gear processing automatic line designed and trial-produced by the Dalian Machine Tool Factory has been successful, and the first batch of standard gears has been rolled out.

    The technical achievements and economic effects of this gear processing automatic line designed and manufactured by the Dalian Machine Tool Factory are enormous. According to relevant department appraisals: it increases production efficiency by three to six times compared to milling, slotting, shaving, and grinding processing methods. A gear can be produced every ninety seconds (required to reach seventy seconds after adjustment). Compared with the gear cutting method, the gear strength of the rolled gear is about 30% higher, the floor space is reduced by about 23%, about 10% to 15% of steel is saved, and the cost is reduced by 10% to 15%. The number of workers required after automation will be reduced from the original eighteen to one.

    This newspaper reports that the Luoyang Bearing Factory has completed two automatic lines. In addition to the inner ring grinding automatic line, which was officially put into production in September and increased efficiency by 70%, a cutting automatic line modified from a six-axis semi-automatic machine tool has recently been successfully tested. This automatic line can save one-third of the labor force.

　　大企业大搞技术革新和技术革命的方向
    哈尔滨出现一批生产自动线
    大连机床厂和洛阳轴承厂试验成功的自动线生产效率提高70％至六倍
    据新华社哈尔滨28日电　哈尔滨市一批现代化的大型企业在技术革新和技术革命运动中，建成许多条自动化连续生产的生产自动线。这些生产自动线的出现，打破了一部分人过去认为现代化企业不能搞技术革新的错误观点，为现代化企业开展技术革新和技术革命开辟了一条道路。
    哈尔滨一批大型企业建成的生产自动线，是在原有设备的基础上，将单个的自动化机器或机械化设备加以改革改组，并且增加传送带等装置，使之连成一组自动化连续生产的机器群。工人们只要在开始生产时调整好机器，就可以使这组机群连续不断地自动地完成某种零件的全部加工工序或几道加工工序。
    各个工厂采用这种方法进行生产，不但充分发挥了设备潜力，节省了机床，提高了生产场地利用率，而且大大提高了劳动生产率，保证了产品质量，进一步做到又多又快又好又省。哈尔滨量具刃具厂职工，将加工“手用丝锥”的机器改造为全自动化，用自动传送带把它们联结成一条“丝锥冷加工自动线”。生产时，工人们从第一台机器上上料，经过六台机床连续不断地加工，最后便制出了冷加工成品。过去生产丝锥由七台机器加工，每台机器是一个独立的工序，由一个工人操作，每班共需七个工人；现在，只需两个工人监督机器操作，节省了五个工人。过去，切断、冲压是分作两道工序在两部机器上进行；现在，工人们在一台机床上安装切断、冲压两种工具，将两道工序合并在一台机床上同时进行，节省了一台机床，缩小了生产场地面积，提高了加工效率。过去，每道工序，工人们都需要将加工活拿到机器上去，加工以后又从机器上拿下来，非生产时间比较多；现在六台机床连续加工，减少了非生产时间。同时，机器经过改造，加工效率一般都有提高。据工厂测算，在联结成生产自动线以后，丝锥的产量提高七倍多，劳动生产率提高十二倍。哈尔滨轴承厂将原有三台机床的位置加以调整，用自动传送机构连接起来，组成了长珠粗磨生产自动线，提高生产效率50％，还减少了三名工人。
    过去机械工人生产时要凭手艺来保证产品质量，现在在生产自动线上，产品完全由机器自动加工，工人只要凭指示灯和仪表就可以控制产品的产量和质量，因此产品的合格率也大大提高。哈尔滨电表仪器厂的软轴摇制生产自动线投入生产以后，就使产品合格率提高了30％。
    生产自动线还为工人们创造了良好的劳动条件。从前一个工人管一台机床，操作时眼睛得紧紧盯着加工对象，上料、下料和上下工序之间运送产品也很频繁；现在，工人们坐在操纵台前就可以监督成群的机器干活，劳动程度就大大减轻。工人高兴地说：“过去认为咱们厂的设备都是全新的，再动脑筋也改不出什么名堂来，现在看来可以改革的地方还多着哩！”到目前为止，全市投入生产的生产自动线共有二十五条，还有八十多条正在研究试验中。
    哈尔滨各现代化大工厂建成生产自动线的根本经验，是坚持政治挂帅，坚决贯彻多快好省的思想。过去，有些现代化工厂的部分干部认为，技术革新和技术革命是小厂和旧厂的事，大厂和新厂设备好，生产水平高，不必也不能再搞什么革新了。各工厂党委把思想革命作为技术革命的前提，先在干部中进行教育，扫清了思想障碍，使参加设计和制造的人员增强了信心。结果，第一条生产自动线就在又大又新的哈尔滨量具刃具厂诞生了。
    本报讯　大连机床厂设计试制的齿轮加工自动线已获得成功，并轧制出第一批标准齿轮。
    大连机床厂设计制成的这条齿轮加工自动线的技术成就和经济效果是巨大的。据有关部门鉴定：它比铣、插、剃、磨的加工方法生产效率提高三至六倍。每隔九十秒（调整后要求达到七十秒）就可制出一个齿轮，轧齿法加工出来的齿轮与切齿法相比，齿轮强度约高30％，占用厂房面积约减少23％，约节约钢材10％至15％，降低成本10％至15％。自动化后所需的工人数将由原来的十八人减少到人。
    本报讯　洛阳轴承厂已搞成了两条自动线。除了9月份正式投入生产的内圈磨加工自动线提高效率70％外，最近又试验成功了六轴半自动机床改装的切削自动线，这条自动线可以节省三分之一的劳动力。
