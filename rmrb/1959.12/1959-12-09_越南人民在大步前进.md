The Vietnamese People Are Advancing in Great Strides
Yang Xiufeng, President of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association and Head of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association Delegation

Just as the people of our country were joyfully and enthusiastically celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association, at the gracious invitation of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, sent a delegation to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for a two-week friendly visit (September 25 to October 10) and to participate in the Vietnamese people's celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of China.

In beautiful and fertile Vietnam, we visited factories, mines, docks, schools, the Revolutionary Museum in Hanoi and Haiphong, and the Fangxing Agricultural Cooperative in Hai Duong Province. During this period, we were warmly welcomed by the Vietnamese people. The enthusiastic celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of China held by the Vietnamese people, and their incomparable joy at the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people over the past ten years, are difficult to describe in words. This shows that the friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples is very deep and is growing stronger day by day. Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said: "Since ancient times, our two countries have had extremely close relations in many aspects. Today, in the socialist family, our two peoples love each other like flesh and blood."

Under the direction of the Central Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of China in Vietnam, the Vietnamese people began a nationwide propaganda campaign with rich and varied content from mid-September. Various districts, provinces, cities, enterprises, mines, docks, and farms carried out various celebration activities: celebration meetings, report meetings, get-togethers, a Chinese Film Week, a Chinese Photo Exhibition, a Chinese Pictorial Distribution Week, a Chinese Book and Publication Distribution Week… Comrades of the Central Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of China personally gave reports on the achievements of China's construction over the past ten years at mass rallies in Hanoi's government offices, factories, schools, and other provinces and cities. Many responsible comrades of the Vietnamese Party and government leading organs also published articles celebrating China's National Day. These celebratory activities further enhanced the Vietnamese people's understanding of China and further developed the friendship between the two peoples. The Vietnamese people celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of China with unparalleled excitement, just as they would celebrate their own festival. In particular, the workers launched a "Friendship Competition Month" from September to welcome and celebrate China's National Day.

During our visit, we conveyed the cordial respect and greetings of the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people. We also saw everywhere that the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, were living a happy new life and were heroically striving with full confidence to realize the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960). The great achievements of the Vietnamese people in building their motherland have also greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the Chinese people in building socialism.

Under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese people are vigorously consolidating the North, leading the North to advance rapidly along the socialist road; and are fighting to achieve the unification of the motherland. This is an extremely arduous, great, and glorious historical task. At present, through extensive socialist ideological education, the three major socialist transformations have been further promoted, and a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production has been launched since the autumn. Wherever we went, we could see the soaring drive and high labor enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, as well as their excellent style of diligence, bravery, and simplicity. One production upsurge after another is pushing towards newer and higher peaks.

During the days when we celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of China with the Vietnamese people, we personally witnessed the unprecedented development of the socialist construction and socialist transformation cause in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Due to the continuous improvement of the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of the Vietnamese people, production is not exceeding the quota by a few percent, but by 10%, 20%, 30%... fulfilling the state plan. It is estimated that the total value of the country's industrial production in 1959 will be equivalent to one and a half times that of last year, two and a half times that of 1957, and more than sixteen times that of 1955.

Hanoi, the capital of the Vietnamese people, is now like the rising sun, advancing in great strides towards a thriving socialist industrial city. In addition to the thirteen original enterprises that have been restored and expanded, many new factories have been built and have begun to produce products that were previously imported.

We once visited the Hanoi Heavy Machinery Plant, which is the largest and most modern large-scale factory, and is now in production. When we visited the workshops, the workers, who were working selflessly, greeted us with enthusiastic eyes and cheers because they could not stop operating. When we said goodbye, because their hands were covered with machine oil and it was not convenient to shake hands, they stretched out their strong arms. This is a moving manifestation of the great friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples. When we visited the Hanoi Unification Match Factory, the person in charge of the factory told us that the production cost in the first half of this year was 7.08% lower than the same period last year, while the productivity increased by 31%. We visited the Haiphong Pier and the Haiphong Enamel Factory in Haiphong City. The throughput of the Haiphong Pier has increased by 50% this year compared with last year, and by 100% compared with the year before, and the labor productivity of workers has increased by 100% to 200%. The Haiphong Enamel Factory only started construction on December 29 last year, but it started trial production on Vietnam's National Day – September 2 this year. The enamel gifts sent to us were trial products from the newly built factory, but the quality was very good. The workers in the Cam Pha mining area of ​​Hong Quang District are also striving to realize the initiative of increasing production targets by another 23% compared with last year.

While industry is developing rapidly, the agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production have also developed rapidly. The cooperativization movement in the vast rural areas of northern Vietnam is advancing valiantly along the path pointed out by President Ho Chi Minh, the beloved leader of the Vietnamese people. We recently learned that, to date, 1,109,528 peasant households in northern Vietnam have joined agricultural cooperatives, accounting for 41.6% of the total number of peasant households. This is the result of the broad masses of peasants, under the leadership of the Labor Party, deeply understanding the darkness of the old society and the unparalleled superiority of cooperativization through factual education and the great debate on the "two roads." They originally expected that by the end of this year, more than 40% of peasant households in northern Vietnam would join agricultural cooperatives, but this target has already been achieved, and many provinces and regions have greatly exceeded this percentage. For example, Vinh Linh district has basically been cooperativized, with 92% of peasant households joining the cooperatives; Phu Tho province has 56% of peasant households joining the cooperatives; Quang Binh province has 51.7% of peasant households joining the cooperatives... When other comrades of our delegation visited Fangxing Agricultural Cooperative in Hai Duong Province, the secretary of the Party branch of this cooperative confidently introduced that by the end of this year, more than 80% of the peasant households in the township would join the agricultural cooperative.

In the vigorous upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, a mass water conservancy movement has also been launched. As of the beginning of October, 3,950 townships have formulated water conservancy plans.

Grain has been harvested abundantly. Although the summer rice crop this year suffered from natural disasters, the yield was still 50% higher than last year's summer rice crop. We recently saw even more exciting news in the newspaper that northern Vietnam overcame water and drought disasters, and the late rice crop in most areas grew better than in any previous year, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest, which will be about one million tons more than last year, twice as high as the average yield per hectare in South Vietnam. The average harvest of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives will be 25% to 30% more than that of individual farmers. This year's bumper harvest in various production cooperatives has further promoted the upsurge of agricultural collectivization.

The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts in northern Vietnam has also made great progress since last year. The management and production of joint ventures have been improved and improved compared with before. The output of industrial production has generally increased by 20% to 100%, with an average increase of 30%. For example, the Hanoi "Ju Li Machinery Factory" could only produce parts in the past, but after the joint venture, it has been able to produce rice milling machines of 15 to 30 tons. After the joint venture, the relationship between commerce and state-owned enterprises has become closer, and the goods sold have greatly increased. The income of many stores has increased three to four times compared with before the joint venture. We once visited the largest Dong Xuan Market in Hanoi, where the order was very good and the management was well-organized.

While the broad working people of South Vietnam are living an inhuman life under the cruel rule of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and cannot even talk about receiving education, in northern Vietnam, with the rapid advancement of industry and agriculture, education has also achieved great achievements. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated in 1958, and currently more than 1.22 million people in various provinces are actively participating in cultural studies. The number of students in ordinary schools (grades 1 to 10) has increased from more than 1,110,000 in 1958 to more than 1,460,000 now, of which the number of students in grades 5 to 10 (equivalent to junior and senior high schools in our country) has increased from more than 130,000 last year to more than 170,000 now. The number of students in secondary vocational schools has increased from more than 8,000 last year to more than 17,000 now. The number of students in higher education institutions has increased from more than 5,000 last year to more than 8,000 now. Including enlightenment classes, there are now more than 2,520,000 young people and children in northern Vietnam who are living a happy and joyful learning life.

Since the educational policy of combining education with productive labor was implemented in 1958, theory has been linked with practice and learning has been closely linked with practice in teaching. On the one hand, they actively participate in public welfare labor outside the school, and at the same time, they have established production workshops in the school to make many products such as chalk, soap, and rayon. Larger schools have also built iron-smelting furnaces. The political and ideological education of schools has also been greatly strengthened. Currently, northern Vietnam is carrying out the communist "New Style Movement" among young people. The booming educational cause in northern Vietnam, like industry and agriculture, is advancing rapidly with great strides.

We are delighted by the rapid development of the Vietnamese people in industry, agriculture, cultural education, and the great achievements in socialist transformation. These great achievements have not only laid a good foundation for consolidating the North, building socialism, and striving for the reunification of the North and South, but also strengthened the strength of the entire socialist camp.

At present, while the Vietnamese people are striving to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland and are working hard to build a socialist North, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in the South, under the aegis of US imperialism, is deliberately sabotaging the Geneva Accords and obstructing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. The Chinese people are extremely angry about this! We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, holding high the banner of peace, reunification, independence, and democracy, will surely achieve victory in their just struggle against US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Next year, the Vietnamese people will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Republic, and will hold the Labor Party Congress to complete the three-year plan for the national economy. At present, the Vietnamese people are welcoming this great year with joy and excitement and with redoubled efforts. We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people will achieve even greater achievements next year. The advance of the Vietnamese people in the cause of socialist construction in the North is an important factor in the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. This visit by our delegation deeply felt the depth of the friendship between China and Vietnam and learned a lot. We believe that the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples will be increasingly consolidated and developed.

    越南人民在大步前进
    中越友好协会会长  中越友好协会代表团团长  杨秀峰
    正当我国人民欢欣鼓舞、热烈庆祝建国十周年的时候，中越友好协会应越中友好协会的盛情邀请，派遣代表团到越南民主共和国进行为时两周（9月25日到10月10日）的友好访问，并参加越南人民庆祝中国建国十周年的活动。
    在美丽富饶的越南，我们访问了河内、海防、鸿广区的工厂、矿山、码头、学校、革命博物馆和海阳省的方兴农业合作社。在此期间，我们受到了越南人民热烈的欢迎。越南人民对中国建国十周年所举行的热情洋溢的庆祝，为中国人民十年来所取得的巨大成就而无比愉快的心情，很难用文字来形容。这说明中越两国人民之间的友谊是十分深厚的，并且日益增强。越南民主共和国范文同总理说：“自古以来，我们两国在许多方面就有着极其密切的关系。今天在社会主义大家庭里，我们两国人民如同骨肉般地相亲相爱。”
    越南人民在越南庆祝中国建国十周年中央筹备委员会的主持下，从9月中旬就开始了全国性的、内容丰富多采的宣传活动。各区、省、城市、企业、矿山、码头、农场都进行了各式各样的庆祝活动：庆祝会、报告会、联欢会、中国电影旬、中国图片展览、中国画报发行旬、中国书刊发行旬……。庆祝中国建国十周年中央筹备委员会的各位同志，亲自在河内的机关、工厂、学校和其他省市的群众集会上作关于中国建国十年来建设成就的报告。越南党、政领导机关的许多负责同志还发表了庆祝中国国庆的文章。这些庆祝活动，进一步增强了越南人民对中国的了解，更加发展了两国人民之间的友谊。越南人民就像庆祝自己的节日一样，怀着无比兴奋的心情来庆祝中国建国十周年。特别是工人们，从9月份起就展开了迎接和庆祝中国国庆的“友好竞赛月”。
    我们在访问期间，向越南人民转达了中国人民的亲切敬意和问候。我们也到处看到越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，过着愉快的新生活，并正在满怀信心地为实现三年计划（1958至1960年）而英勇奋斗。越南人民建设祖国的巨大成就，也大大鼓舞了中国人民建设社会主义的热情。
    越南人民在越南劳动党的领导下，正在大力巩固北方、领导北方沿着社会主义道路迅速迈进；并且正在为实现祖国统一而斗争。这是一项极其繁重、伟大而光荣的历史任务。目前，通过广泛的社会主义思想教育，进一步推动了社会主义的三大改造，掀起了入秋以来的工农业生产新高潮。我们所到之处，都可看到工人、农民的冲天干劲和高涨的劳动热情，以及勤劳勇敢、艰苦朴素的优良作风。生产高潮一浪赶过一浪，推向更新的高峰。
    我们在同越南人民一道庆祝中国建国十周年的日子里，亲眼看到了越南民主共和国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业获得了空前的大发展。由于越南广大人民的社会主义觉悟不断提高，生产就不是超额百分之几，而是超额10％、20％、30％……地完成国家计划。预计1959年国家工业的生产总值将相当于去年的一倍半，相当于1957年的二倍半，相当于1955年的十六倍多。
    越南人民的首都河内市，现在正如旭日东升，朝着欣欣向荣的社会主义工业城市大步迈进。除了已经恢复和扩建原有十三个企业外，还新建了许多工厂，开始生产向来都靠进口的产品。
    我们曾经参观过河内重型机床厂，这是一个规模最大、设备最新的大型工厂，现在已经投入生产。当我们到各车间参观时，正在忘我劳动的工人们，因为无法停止操作，就用充满着热情的眼光和欢呼声迎接我们。告别时，由于他们双手沾满了机器油不好握手，就把健壮的胳膊伸过来。这是越南人民对中国人民伟大友谊的动人的表现。当我们到河内统一火柴厂参观时，工厂的负责同志告诉我们，今年上半年的产品成本比去年同期降低7.08％，而生产率却提高31％。我们到海防市参观过海防码头和海防搪瓷厂。海防码头的吞吐量，今年比去年增加50％，比前年增加100％，工人劳动生产率提高100％到200％。海防搪瓷厂是去年12月29日才动工兴建，但在今年越南国庆节——9月2日那天就开始试产了，送给我们的搪瓷礼品，虽是新建厂的试产品，但质量很好。鸿广区锦普矿区的工人们，也正在为实现生产指标比去年再提高23％的倡议而奋斗。
    在工业大发展的同时，农业合作化运动和农业生产也有迅速的发展。越南北方广大农村的合作化运动，正沿着越南人民敬爱的领袖胡志明主席指出的道路勇猛前进。最近了解，到目前为止，越南北方参加农业合作社的农户为一百一十万九千五百二十八户，占农户总数的41.6％。这是广大农民在劳动党的领导下，经过事实的教育和通过“两条道路”的大辩论，深刻地认识了旧社会的黑暗和合作化的无比优越性的结果。他们原来预计到今年年底，越南北方将有40％以上的农户加入农业合作社，可是现在就已经达到这个指标，而且有许多省、区大大超过了这个百分比。如永灵区已基本上合作化，有92％的农户入了社；富寿省有56％的农户入了社；广平省有51.7％的农户入了社……。我们代表团其他同志到海阳省参观方兴农业合作社时，这个社党支部书记满怀信心地介绍说，到今年年底，该乡将有80％以上的农户加入农业合作社。
    在声势浩大的农业合作化高潮中，群众性的水利化运动也已展开，到10月上旬止，就已经有三千九百五十个乡制订了水利规划。
    粮食已庆丰收。今年夏稻虽然遭到了自然灾害，仍比去年夏稻产量增加50％。我们最近从报纸上看到了更加振奋人心的消息，越南北方战胜了水、旱灾害，大部分地区的晚稻长得比过去任何一年都好，获得了空前的大丰收，将比去年大约增加一百万吨，比南越的平均每公顷产量高一倍。参加农业生产合作社的农民的平均收成将比个体农民多25％到30％。今年各生产合作社的丰收，进一步推动了农业集体化的高潮。
    越南北方资本主义工商业、手工业的社会主义改造，从去年以来也有很大进展。合营后的经营和生产都比以前有所改进和提高。工业的生产产量一般增加20％到100％，平均增加30％，如河内“巨力机器厂”，从前只能生产零件，合营后已能生产十五吨到三十吨的碾米机。商业在合营后与国营企业的关系更加密切，销售的货物大大增加，许多商店收入比合营前增加三倍到四倍。我们曾经参观过河内最大的同春市场，秩序很好，经营有条不紊。
    正当越南南方广大劳动人民在美国和吴庭艳集团的残酷统治下过着非人的生活，根本谈不到受教育的时候，在越南北方，随着工农业的大步前进，教育事业也获得了巨大成就。1958年已经基本扫除了文盲，目前各省共有一百二十二万多人在积极参加文化学习。普通学校的学生（一年至十年级）已从1958年的一百一十一万多人发展到现在的一百四十六万多人，其中五年至十年级（相当于我国初、高中）学生则由去年十三万多发展到现在的十七万多人。中等专业学校的学生则由去年的八千多人发展到现在的一万七千多人。高等学校学生已从去年的五千多发展到现在的八千多人。连同启蒙班在内，越南北方现在共有二百五十二万多青少年和儿童，在过着幸福、愉快的学习生活。
    自从1958年贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针以来，在教学上，理论联系实际、学习与实践密切地联系起来了。一方面积极参加校外的公益劳动，同时在校内建立了生产车间，自制粉笔、肥皂和人造棉等许多产品，较大的学校还兴建了炼铁炉。学校的政治思想教育也大大加强，目前越南北方正在广大青年中开展共产主义“新风尚运动”。蓬勃发展的越南北方教育事业，像工农业一样，正以巨大的步伐向前猛进。
    我们为越南人民在工业、农业、文化教育事业等方面获得迅速的发展和社会主义改造方面也获得了巨大的成就而欢欣鼓舞。这些巨大的成就，不仅为巩固北方、建设社会主义和争取南北统一的大业奠定了良好基础，而且壮大了整个社会主义阵营的力量。
    目前，越南人民正在争取实现祖国的和平统一、努力建设社会主义北方的时候，南方吴庭艳集团却在美帝国主义的卵翼下，蓄意破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的和平统一。中国人民对此万分愤怒！我们坚信，越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，高举着和平、统一、独立和民主的大旗，坚决反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的正义斗争，一定会取得胜利。明年，越南人民将庆祝越南劳动党成立三十周年和共和国成立十五周年，将召开劳动党代表大会，完成国民经济的三年计划。目前，越南人民正以欢欣鼓舞的心情，以加倍的努力来迎接这伟大的一年。我们坚信，越南人民将会在明年获得更大的成就。越南人民在北方的社会主义建设事业的迈进，是和平统一越南的重要因素。我们代表团这次访问，深刻体会到中越两国友谊之深厚，学到了很多东西。我们相信，中越两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊，将日益巩固和发展。
