Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 29th: Workers at the Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan Province have overfulfilled the annual state plan ahead of schedule. As of December 20th, raw coal production exceeded the state plan by 7.97%, an increase of 44.8% compared to last year; total tunneling footage exceeded the state plan by 3.74%; and raw coal costs were reduced by 0.18% compared to the state plan.

Under the leadership of the Party, the workers of Jiaozuo Coal Mine have vigorously engaged in technological innovation and revolution, comprehensively renovating and expanding old mines. They have also promoted various advanced experiences, greatly increasing the output of coal mining work surfaces. From March to November this year, the average daily output of coal mining work surfaces reached more than 15,000 tons, an increase of 28.46% compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, December 29th: Xuzhou Coal Mine achieved a double harvest in production and capital construction. As of the 26th, the mine had overfulfilled this year's coal production plan, increasing total output by 49.1% compared to last year; the annual tunneling plan was also completed, with total footage increasing by 65.4% compared to last year; and the ash content of raw coal from January to November was 3.12% lower than the state plan. The annual capital construction task was completed ten days ahead of schedule. Since July, nine pairs of large and small mines and three washing plants have been built and put into production.

This year, Xuzhou Coal Mine workers put forward more than 72,000 rationalization proposals, of which more than 2,000 were of significant value, playing a great role in saving labor and solving difficulties in materials and equipment shortages. This year, the mine promoted and created many high-yield experiences in coal mining and tunneling. For example, the first mining area of ​​Xiaqiao Mine boldly created a coal mining method with two or even three shots per cut, increasing the daily output from more than 500 tons to more than 800 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 28th: Tianfu Coal Mine in Chongqing, one of the largest coal mines in Southwest China, has fully completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule. As of the 25th of this month, the total output value of raw coal, tunneling footage, and labor productivity have all been completed ahead of schedule, and costs have been reduced by 2.2% compared to the plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 29th: A large-scale mine, Mine No. 1, newly built at the Pingdingshan Coal Mine in Henan Province, was officially handed over for production on the 25th. Before the handover, it was inspected and appraised by the State Acceptance Committee, and the project quality was excellent. The design capacity of Pingdingshan Mine No. 1 is 1.5 million tons of raw coal per year. The total construction period for this modern, large-scale mine was only two years, seven and a half months ahead of the design period, and the investment was saved by 35.97%.

Pingdingshan Mine No. 1 is the largest pair of mines in the Pingdingshan Coal Mine. By the time Mine No. 1 was put into production, a total of eight pairs of mines had been built and put into production in the entire Pingdingshan Coal Mine, with a total design capacity of 5.52 million tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou: A modern, large-scale vertical shaft producing 600,000 tons of prime coking coal annually was officially handed over for production on the 25th in the Shiguai coalfield near Baotou. It is a new type of mine where everything from drilling, blasting, underground transportation to hoisting is fully mechanized.

The Shiguai Coal Mine is a coal mining area with a large reserve of coking coal. In the near future, Baotou Iron and Steel (Baogang)'s required coking coal will be largely supplied from here.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 29th: The Pinghu and Xianguling mines, two newly built mines in the Fengcheng Coal Mine in Jiangxi Province, were officially completed and handed over for production on the 27th.

The Pinghu mine is a pair of hydraulic mining mines with the latest technical equipment, and the entire production process is fully mechanized. The Xianguling mine is a pair of dry mining mines, and most of the entire production process is also mechanized.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The Quantai and Qishan mines in Xuzhou, two medium-sized mechanized coal mines, were recently completed and handed over for production ahead of schedule.

The Quantai vertical shaft was put into production eight months ahead of the time stipulated by the state. The Qishan coal mine has a shaft depth of 280 meters, making it the deepest mine in Jiangsu Province.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 29th: Another mechanized mine in Chongqing, the Yanshitai Mine, was recently fully completed and officially put into production. This pair of mines produces coking coal and has a design capacity of 450,000 tons per year.

　　煤炭工业连传捷报
    焦作、徐州和天府煤矿全面完成今年生产计划
    河南、内蒙古、江西、江苏、四川有七对新矿井投入生产
    据新华社郑州29日电　河南焦作煤矿职工提前超额完成了全年国家计划。到12月20日止，原煤产量超过国家计划7.97％，比去年增产44.8％；掘进总进尺比国家计划超额3.74％；原煤成本比国家计划降低0.18％。
    焦作煤矿职工们在党的领导下大闹技术革新和技术革命，全面改建和扩建了旧矿井。他们还推广了各种先进经验，使采煤工作面的产量大大提高了；今年3月到11月，采煤工作面平均日产量达到一万五千多吨，比去年提高28.46％。
    据新华社徐州29日电　徐州煤矿生产和基本建设双丰收。到26日为止，这个矿已经超额完成了今年的产煤计划，比去年总产量提高49.1％；全年掘进计划也同时完成，总进尺比去年提高了65.4％；1至11月份的原煤灰分比国家计划降低3.12％。全年基本建设任务提前十天完成。从7月份以来，先后有九对大小矿井和三座洗选厂建成并投入生产。
    今年，徐州煤矿职工共提出七万二千多条合理化建议，其中价值比较重大的有二千多条，对节约劳力，解决材料、设备不足的困难，起了很大作用。这个矿今年在采煤和掘进方面推广和创造了许多丰产经验。例如，夏桥矿采煤一区大胆创造了一刀两炮甚至三炮的采煤方法，日产量从五百多吨提高到了八百多吨。
    据新华社重庆28日电　西南地区最大的煤矿之一——重庆天府煤矿，已提前全面完成今年国家计划。到本月25日止，原煤总产值，掘进进尺、劳动生产率都已提前完成，成本比计划降低2.2％。
    据新华社郑州29日电　河南省平顶山煤矿新建的一矿大型矿井，25日正式移交生产；移交生产前，经过国家验收委员会验收鉴定，工程质量优良。平顶山一矿的设计能力为年产原煤一百五十万吨。这对现代化的大型矿井，总建设工期只用了两年，比设计工期提前七个半月，并且节约投资35.97％。
    平顶山一矿是平顶山煤矿最大的一对矿井。截至一矿投入生产止，全平顶山煤矿已有八对矿井建成生产，总设计能力达五百五十二万吨。
    据新华社包头电　一对年产六十万吨主焦煤的现代化大型竖井，25日在包头附近的石拐煤田上正式移交生产。它是一座从打眼、放炮、井下运输，一直到提升完全是机械化操作的新型矿井。
    石拐煤矿是一个蕴藏着大量炼焦煤的煤矿区。不久以后，包钢需要的炼焦煤，将大量由这里供应。
    据新华社南昌29日电　江西省丰城煤矿新建的坪湖、仙姑岭两对矿井，在27日正式建成移交生产。
    坪湖矿井是一对具有最新技术装备的水力采煤矿井，生产过程全部机械化。仙姑岭矿井是一对旱采矿井，整个生产过程也大部分是机械化作业。
    据新华社南京电　徐州权台、旗山两对中型机械化煤井，最近先后提前建成移交生产。
    权台竖井比国家规定的时间提前八个月投入生产。旗山煤井井筒深二百八十米，是江苏省现有矿井中最深的一个。
    据新华社重庆29日电　重庆市又一对机械化的矿井——砚石台矿井，在最近全部建成并正式投入生产。这对矿井生产炼焦煤，设计能力为年产四十五万吨。
