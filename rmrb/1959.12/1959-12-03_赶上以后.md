Short Commentary:

    The powerful vitality of the people's communes is increasingly displaying even more brilliant splendor. The fact that all nine poor teams of the Jiangxiang People's Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi, introduced in today's newspaper, have caught up with the rich teams is another proof of this powerful vitality and incomparable superiority.

    However, what to do after the poor teams catch up with the rich teams, and what problems need to be solved? This is a new subject. Only by continuing to solve new problems can new achievements be made. Judging from the situation of the Jiangxiang Commune, there are at least two problems currently facing these production teams that have caught up: In economic terms, it is easy to produce contradictions between accumulation and consumption; in ideological terms, it is easy to have contradictions between relaxation, complacency, and continued progress. Because these production teams caught up with the rich teams all at once this year, both the total income and the net income of the commune members have increased several times. Some commune members want to acquire more personal belongings and are unwilling to accumulate more; in addition, some commune members feel that they have worked hard for a year and finally caught up with the rich teams, and now they can take a rest, and a mood of relaxation has occurred. Therefore, how to seize the opportunity of the year-end distribution and winter production, combined with resolving these contradictions, is an important issue for further developing production and consolidating the commune.

    The leaders of the Jiangxiang People's Commune have a visionary spirit. They have studied these contradictions in a timely manner and focused on helping these production teams in two aspects: The first is to strengthen ideological education. By summarizing the experience of these production teams from poverty to prosperity, they further realize that although the production level of their own team has greatly improved this year, compared with the original rich teams, the public accumulation is less and the basic construction is poor, and the foundation for further development of production is relatively weak. Moreover, the broad masses of commune members must realize that our goal is to build a modern, mechanized, and electrified new countryside. To achieve this, we must live rich days as if they were poor days, continue to be diligent and thrifty in managing the household and running the commune, and appropriately increase accumulation. Through summarizing experience and future education, the minds of the commune members have brightened, and everyone is full of energy, and they have put forward the goals for next year's struggle. In order to achieve this goal, many commune members have saved their surplus cash, appropriately increased the proportion of public accumulation funds, and vigorously carried out farmland capital construction, preparing more sufficient material conditions for next year's production.

    Secondly, the commune needs to continue to strengthen its leadership and support for these production teams. Although the production of these production teams has greatly developed this year, due to various reasons, they still have many difficulties, such as less farmland capital construction, poor water conservancy conditions, poor soil, fewer livestock and farm tools, and weaker cadre strength. The Jiangxiang Commune has not relaxed its leadership and support for them because these teams have caught up with the rich teams, but has continued to strengthen leadership and support. They allocated funds to support these production teams to build drainage and irrigation projects, organized farm tool factories to rush to make tools to support these teams in deep plowing and soil improvement, and when arranging production, they allocated more tasks of planting high-yield cash crops with large incomes to these production teams in order to increase their income more, and focused on cultivating and generally training the cadres of these production teams. The main cadres of the commune divided their work and contracted to strengthen their leadership, etc. This approach is correct. Will this affect the development speed of the entire commune's production? No. First, because while vigorously strengthening the leadership of these production teams with a weak economic foundation, they have not relaxed the leadership of general teams and rich teams; second, strengthening the leadership of these teams to make their production continue to leap forward is an important factor in promoting the rapid development of the entire commune's production; only by further eliminating the economic differences between teams can the pace of the entire commune's progress be more consistent, and the speed of the commune's progress be faster.

    赶上以后
    人民公社的强大生命力日益发挥出更绚烂的光彩。本报今天介绍的江西南昌县蒋巷人民公社的九个穷队全部赶上了富队的事实，就是这种强大生命力和无比优越性的又一证明。
    但是，穷队赶上富队以后怎么办，还有些什么问题需要解决？这是一个新的课题。只有继续解决一些新的问题，才能取得新的成就。从蒋巷公社的情况看，当前摆在这些赶上来的生产队面前的，最少有两个问题：在经济方面，容易产生积累与消费的矛盾；在思想方面，容易发生松懈自满与继续前进的矛盾。由于这些生产队今年一下赶上了富队，总收入和社员的纯收入都有成倍的增长，有些社员就想多置些个人的家当，不愿意多积累；另外，有些社员觉得苦干了一年，好容易赶上富队，如今可以休息一下了，发生了松一口气的情绪。因此，如何抓紧年终分配与冬季生产的时机，结合解决这些矛盾，是进一步发展生产和巩固公社的一个重要问题。
    蒋巷人民公社的领导者具有高瞻远瞩的气概，他们及时地研究了这些矛盾，着重从两方面来帮助这些生产队：首先是加强思想教育，通过总结这些生产队由穷变富的经验，使大家进一步认识到虽然本队的生产水平今年有了很大提高，但是比起原来的富队，公共积累少，基本建设差，进一步发展生产的基础就比较弱；并且要广大社员认识：我们的目标是要建立一个现代化、机械化和电气化的新农村，要做到这些，就必须把富日子当穷日子过，继续勤俭持家，勤俭办社，适当增加积累。通过总结经验和前途教育，社员的心地亮堂了，个个干劲十足，提出了明年的奋斗目标。为了实现这个目标，许多社员把多余的现金储蓄起来，适当地提高公积金的比例，大办农田基本建设，为明年的生产准备了更充足的物质条件。
    其次，公社还需要继续加强对这些生产队的领导与支援。虽然这些生产队今年的生产有了很大发展，但是由于种种原因，他们仍然有不少困难，譬如农田基本建设少，水利条件差，土壤不好，牲口农具少，干部力量较弱等。蒋巷公社并没有因为这些队赶上了富队，就放松了对他们的领导和支援，而是继续加强领导和支援。他们拨出资金支援这些生产队修建排灌工程，组织农具厂赶制工具支援这些队深耕改良土壤，安排生产时把收益大的种植高产经济作物的任务多分配一些给这些生产队，以便更多地增加他们的收入，重点培养和普遍训练这些生产队的干部，公社主要干部分工包干加强对他们的领导等等，这样作是正确的。这会不会影响整个公社生产的发展速度呢？不会。第一，因为他们在大力加强领导这些经济基础较差的生产队的同时，并没有放松对一般队和富队的领导；第二，加强了对这些队的领导，使它们的生产继续跃进，就是促使全社生产迅速发展的一个重要因素；只有进一步消灭了队与队之间的经济差别，整个公社前进的步伐才能更加一致起来，公社前进的速度才能更快。
