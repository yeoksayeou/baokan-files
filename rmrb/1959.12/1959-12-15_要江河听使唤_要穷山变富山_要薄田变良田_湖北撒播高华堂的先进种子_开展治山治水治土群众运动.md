To Make Rivers Obey, To Turn Barren Mountains into Rich Mountains, To Turn Poor Land into Fertile Land
Hubei Sows the Advanced Seeds of Gao Huatang and Launches a Mass Movement to Control Mountains, Rivers, and Soil
Gao Huatang's advanced experience: Control water before mountains and soil, control water from the source, and lead water up the mountains; on this basis, vigorously develop terraced fields and land construction, continuously improve the soil, and vigorously develop afforestation and other diversified operations.

(Our newspaper, Wuhan, 14th dispatch) “To make rivers obey, to turn barren mountains into rich mountains, to turn poor land into fertile land,” the agricultural basic construction with water control, mountain control, and soil control created by Gao Huatang, a labor model in Yun County, as the main content, has formed a vigorous mass movement throughout Hubei Province.

This excellent situation emerged after the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, put forward the experience of "learning from Gao Huatang, catching up with Gao Huatang," "learning from Yun County, catching up with Yun County," and "learning from Zao Yang, catching up with Zao Yang" in controlling mountains, rivers, and soil. After the promotion of these advanced experiences, the province successively completed more than 140 million cubic meters of earthwork, reclaimed more than 15 million mu of wasteland; converted more than 6.6 million mu of dry land into paddy fields and slopes into terraced fields; leveled about 25 million mu of land, of which about 14 million mu reached the standard of garden-like fields, and improved the soil in varying degrees on more than 2.25 million mu of fields and land, all within two months. The progress has greatly exceeded the same period last year. In addition, all localities have done a great job in vigorously grasping the accumulation and production of fertilizer, diversified operations, and field management.

Gao Huatang is a famous labor model in Yun County and the Party Branch Secretary of the Construction Management District of Da Yan Commune. Under the leadership of the Party organization and with the support of the masses, he has created a set of comprehensive water control, mountain control, and soil control experiences after several years of exploration: Water control must be done before mountain and soil control, and water control must trace the source and start from the source, leading water up the mountains; on the basis of water control, vigorously develop the construction of terraced fields and land, continuously improve the soil, and vigorously develop afforestation and other diversified operations. This approach has been extremely effective. By last year, the grain output of the entire management district had increased more than tenfold compared to 1948; this year, despite the severe drought, grain production still achieved a bumper harvest. Since last year, the Yun County Committee of the Communist Party of China has summarized Gao Huatang's experience and launched a movement of "learning from Gao Huatang and catching up with Gao Huatang" throughout the county, which has also achieved significant results. Last year, the county's grain output increased by more than 1.3 times compared to 1948, transforming it from a grain-deficient county to a surplus-grain county; this year, under severe drought conditions, the county's grain output increased by another 10% compared to last year. From autumn plowing and autumn planting to the present, the county has further promoted Gao Huatang's experience. In the past two months, the county has built a large number of new water conservancy projects, converted nearly 700,000 mu of mountains into terraced fields and land, and completed nearly 200,000 mu of afforestation tasks.

Zao Yang County is a county with a small population, large land area, little plain, and more hilly land. Water conservancy conditions are poor, transportation is extremely inconvenient, and agricultural output was very low in the past. Since last year, the county has vigorously transformed the hilly land with the construction of water conservancy as the center, so that this year's grain output in the county still increased compared with last year under severe drought conditions, greatly exceeding the normal annual production level in history.

At the end of October, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a symposium on winter production and agricultural production basic construction with the participation of the first secretaries of the local prefectural committees, municipal committees, and county committees. At this symposium, the Provincial Committee summarized the experiences of Gao Huatang and Yun County and Zao Yang County, determined to take water control, mountain control, and soil control as the main content of agricultural basic construction, and put forward the call of "learning from Gao Huatang, catching up with Gao Huatang," "learning from Yun County, catching up with Yun County," and "learning from Zao Yang, catching up with Zao Yang." Then, the participating cadres, led by Wang Renzhong, the first secretary of the Provincial Committee, visited Zao Yang and Yun County, and focused on the Construction Management District led by Gao Huatang as the focus of the visit, using the method of visiting, discussing, and arranging to promote the advanced experience of these areas in vigorously carrying out agricultural basic construction. Subsequently, various localities successively organized a large number of cadres and mass representatives to visit these areas. The broad masses of cadres and the masses were greatly encouraged through visits, communication, and discussion, expressing their desire to actively learn from and promote the advanced experience of Gao Huatang and others. Subsequently, a new upsurge of agricultural basic construction with water control, mountain control, and soil control as the main content quickly formed throughout the province.

When learning from and promoting the advanced experience of Gao Huatang and others, Hubei Province generally paid attention to combining the learning of their magnificent spirit of transforming nature with the promotion of their successful methods of transforming nature, and combining their advanced experience with the specific conditions of the local area. Therefore, the following aspects were generally emphasized: overall planning, strengthening leadership; water-based, comprehensive management; adapting to local conditions, self-reliance; mobilizing the masses, reforming tools. The Jingzhou area, most of which is located in the Jianghan Plain, under the premise of overall planning and strengthening leadership, boldly mobilized the masses, vigorously built river networks, and took into account the water conservancy construction in mountainous and hilly areas, planning to comprehensively utilize the Yangtze River, Han River, lakes, and mountain water sources, and also actively reclaimed wasteland, expanded cultivated land area according to the characteristics of the vast land in the Jianghan Plain, and vigorously transformed terraced fields and land in mountainous and hilly areas, so as to increase agricultural products at a high speed and better support national construction. At present, more than 1.2 million laborers in this area have been put into the water control, mountain control, and soil control movement. The Huanggang area, located in the hills, has proposed a grand plan to comprehensively control water, mountains, and soil according to water and mountain systems based on the experience of Gao Huatang and others, and to rapidly change the face of the entire region. During this winter and next spring, the eight major water systems in this area, including Jushui, Daoshui, Xishui, and Qihe, will be completely managed except for individual ones. At that time, the irrigation area will account for 90% of the total cultivated land area. In order to change the poor and backward face of the mountainous areas, the Enshi area, where mountainous areas occupy a dominant position, has decided to vigorously develop diversified operations in the mountainous areas with water control as the center, turning poor mountains into rich mountains and barren mountains into orchards.

After the masses in various places were mobilized, the speed of agricultural basic construction continued to accelerate through large-scale corps operations and vigorous tool reform. Many rivers, wastelands, and hills changed their appearance in a few days or ten days. Ying Shan County and An Lu County each reclaimed more than 700,000 mu of wasteland in more than a month, more than the original cultivated land of the two counties. After carrying out the tool improvement, semi-mechanization, and mechanization movement, Han Yang County created a large number of improved tools, so that the efficiency of transporting soil increased from an average of 1.5 cubic meters per person per day at the beginning to more than 10 cubic meters. Shi Shou County organized more than 60,000 people as a unit of the commune and adopted the method of large-scale corps operations, and completed 10 lake management projects in seven days, turning 130,000 mu of wasteland of reeds into good farmland. In just over 20 days, the Jiu Dao Qu Commune in Fang County completed 140 water conservancy projects that can irrigate 35,000 mu of paddy fields, and converted 15,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields.

Now, under the leadership of the Provincial Committee and the Party Committees at all levels, the broad masses of cadres and the masses are advancing victoriously, full of confidence to create conditions for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year. (Attached pictures)

    要江河听使唤　要穷山变富山　要薄田变良田
    湖北撒播高华堂的先进种子  开展治山治水治土群众运动
    高华堂的先进经验：治山治土先治水，治水要从源头治起，引水上山；在此基础上大搞梯田、梯地建设，不断改良土壤，大力发展植树造林等多种经营。
    本报武汉14日电　“要江河听使唤、要穷山变富山、要薄田变良田”，以郧县劳动模范高华堂所创造的治水、治山、治土为主要内容的农业基本建设，已在湖北全省形成轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
    这个大好形势是在党的八中全会精神的鼓舞下，中共湖北省委提出了“学高华堂、赶高华堂”，“学郧县、赶郧县”，“学枣阳、赶枣阳”治山治水治土的经验以后出现的。这些先进经验推广以后，全省在两个多月的时间内先后完成的土方达一亿四千多万方，开荒一千五百多万亩；旱地改水田和坡地改梯地共六百六十多万亩；平整土地约二千五百万亩，其中约一千四百万亩达到了园田化的标准，在不同程度上改良了土壤的田和地共达二百二十五万多亩。进度都大大地超过了去年同期。此外，各地在大抓积肥、造肥、多种经营、田间管理等方面，都作得很出色。
    高华堂是郧县著名的劳动模范、大堰公社建设管理区党总支书记，他在党组织的领导和群众支持下，经过几年的摸索，创造出了一套全面治水、治山、治土的经验：治山、治土必须先治水，而治水必须追源溯流，从源头治起，引水上山；在治水的基础上大搞梯田、梯地的建设，不断改良土壤，大力发展植树造林等多种经营。这种作法收效极大。到去年，全管理区的粮食产量已较1948年增长十倍以上；今年虽遭特大旱灾，粮食生产仍然获得了丰收。去年以来，中共郧县县委总结了高华堂的经验，在全县掀起了“学高华堂、赶高华堂”的运动，收效也极显著。去年，这个县的粮食产量较1948年增长一点三倍强，由缺粮县一跃而为余粮县；今年，全县在大旱情况下，粮食产量较去年又增产一成。从秋耕、秋种到现在，这个县进一步推广了高华堂的经验。两个多月来，全县又新建了大批水利工程，在五千多座山上改出梯田、梯地近七十万亩，还完成了植树造林近二十万亩的任务。
    枣阳县是个人少、地多，平原少、岗地多的县份，水利条件差、交通极不方便，过去农业产量很低。去年以来，这个县以兴修水利为中心大力改造了岗地，使今年全县粮食产量在大旱条件下仍比去年增产，大大地超过了历史上的常年年产水平。
    10月底，中共湖北省委召开了有各地委、市委、县委第一书记参加的冬季生产和农业生产基本建设座谈会。在这次座谈会上，省委总结了高华堂和郧县、枣阳县的经验，确定以治水、治山、治土为农业基本建设的主要内容，并且提出了“学高华堂、赶高华堂”“学郧县、赶郧县”，“学枣阳、赶枣阳”的号召。接着，到会干部在省委第一书记王任重同志亲自率领下，到枣阳、郧县参观，并以高华堂领导的建设管理区作为参观的重点，用边参观、边讨论、边安排的办法，推广这些地区大搞农业基本建设的先进经验。随后，各地又先后组织了大批干部和群众代表，到这些地区参观和访问。广大干部和群众通过参观、访问、传达、讨论，受到了巨大的鼓舞，表示要积极学习和推广高华堂等的先进经验。接着，一个以治水、治山、治土为主要内容的农业基本建设新高潮，就在全省迅速形成。
    湖北省各地在学习和推广高华堂等的先进经验时，普遍地注意了把学习他们改造自然的雄伟气魄和推广他们改造自然的成功方法结合起来，把他们的先进经验和本地的具体情况结合起来。因此，一般都强调了如下几个方面：全面规划，加强领导；以水为主，综合治理；因地制宜，自力更生；发动群众，改革工具。大部分地区处于江汉平原的荆州专区，就在全面规划，加强领导的前提下，放手发动群众，大力兴建河网，并兼顾山区、丘陵区的水利建设，计划把长江、汉水、湖泊和山区水源，都加以综合利用，同时还根据江汉平原土地辽阔的特点，积极开荒，扩大耕地面积，并在山区和丘陵区大改梯田、梯地，这样来高速度地增加农产品，更好地支援国家建设。目前，这个专区投入治水、治山、治土运动的劳动力已达一百二十多万。地处丘陵的黄冈专区已根据高华堂等的经验，提出了按水系、山系全面治水、治山、治土，高速改变全区面貌的宏伟规划。在今冬明春内，这个专区的举水、倒水、浠水、圻河等八大主要水系，除个别外，都将治理完毕。那时，灌溉面积将占总耕地面积的90％。山区占统治地位的恩施专区，为改变山区穷困、落后的面貌，决定以治水为中心大力发展山区多种经营，把穷山变成富山，荒山变成花果山。
    各地群众发动起来以后，通过大兵团作战和大搞工具改革，使农业基本建设的速度不断加快。许多河流、荒地、山丘，在几天、十几天之间就变了样子。应山县和安陆县一个多月内各开荒七十多万亩，比两县原有的耕地还多。汉阳县在开展了工具改良化、半机械化和机械化运动后，创造大批改良工具，使运土工效由开始时的平均每人每天一方半提高到十方多。石首县以公社为单位组织了六万多人采用大兵团作战的方法，在七天内就完成了十处治湖工程，将十三万亩芦苇丛生的荒湖洲变成了良田。房县九道渠公社，仅用二十多天的时间就完成了可灌溉三万五千亩水田的水利工程一百四十处，并且把一万五千亩旱地改成了水田。
    现在，在省委和各级党委的领导下，广大干部和群众意气风发地乘胜前进，满怀信心地为明年农业生产的继续跃进创造条件。（附图片）
