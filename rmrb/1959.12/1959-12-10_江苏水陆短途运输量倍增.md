Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 8th. Jiangsu Province is actively organizing mass short-distance water and land transportation, transporting large quantities of agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, oil, and pigs, as well as basic construction materials, to cities and construction sites; and promptly delivering daily-use industrial products to rural areas. In November, the province's short-distance transport volume of goods increased by more than double compared to October.

Jiangsu Province's cargo transportation volume in November and December will greatly exceed the level of the same period in 1958, with most of the materials needing to be transported via short distances. Based on this situation, Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province are further implementing the policy of "walking on two legs." In addition to strengthening the unified dispatch of professional transportation tools to better undertake the long-distance transportation tasks between provinces, special districts, and counties, they are also organizing civilian tools to further strengthen mass short-distance transportation.

Currently, 84% of the province's people's communes have established professional transportation teams and loading and unloading teams, and have also organized reserve transportation teams that are both agricultural and transport-oriented. Nine medium-sized cities have established street transportation organizations. Various industrial and mining enterprises are also drawing on manpower and tools, based on the spirit of self-reliance, to independently handle short-distance transportation. Since late November, an average of nearly 30,000 wooden sailing boats and over 100,000 carts and animal-drawn vehicles have participated in short-distance transportation every day throughout the province.

    江苏水陆短途运输量倍增
    据新华社南京8日电　江苏省各地积极组织群众性的水陆短途运输，把大批粮、棉、油、猪等农副产品和基本建设物资源源运往城市、工地；又把日用工业品及时送到农村。11月份，全省短途运输的物资比10月份增加一倍以上。
    江苏省十一、十二两个月的货物运输量将大大超过1958年同期的水平，其中大部分物资需要经过短途运输。根据这个情况，江苏省各级党委进一步贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，除了加强统一调度专业运输工具，使它们更好地担负起省、专区和县际之间的长途运输任务以外，还把民间工具组织起来，进一步加强群众性的短途运输。
    目前，全省已有84％的人民公社建立了专业运输队和装卸队，还组织了亦农亦运的后备运输队。九个中等城市都建立了街道运输组织。各个工矿企业也本着自力更生精神，抽调人力工具，自办短途运输。从11月下旬以来，全省平均每天有近三万条木帆船、上十万辆人力畜力车参加短途运输。
