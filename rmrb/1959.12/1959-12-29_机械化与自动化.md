Mechanization and Automation

　　In the production process, whether it is basic or auxiliary operations, if machines are used to perform all tasks, and manual labor is limited to only a few effortless tasks (such as operating machines), this is called mechanization. On the basis of mechanization, if we further adopt automatic control, automatic measurement, and automatic adjustment devices to operate machines; or, in other words, if the entire process, from the entry of raw materials to the delivery of finished products, is automatically completed by machines, and people only supervise the normal operation of the machines, then this is called automation. Partial or incomplete mechanization and automation are respectively called semi-mechanization and semi-automation. Therefore, automation is a further development of mechanization and is a higher stage of mechanization.

　　Automation can be divided into equipment automation and comprehensive automation according to its scope of application. Equipment automation, also known as single-machine automation, refers to the automation of a single working machine; it is the basis of comprehensive automation. Comprehensive automation mainly refers to automated production lines, automated workshops, and automated factories, etc., which is the highest form of automation. On the basis of single-machine automation, when automatic transportation devices are used to connect related automatic machines together according to the technological process, and automatic measurement and adjustment devices are used to complete the entire manufacturing process of a certain workpiece, it is called an automatic production line. If the scope of the automatic production line is further expanded to the entire workshop or the entire factory, then it is an automated workshop and an automated factory.

　　Automation has a higher labor productivity than mechanization, and it can also improve product quality and improve labor conditions.

　　机械化与自动化
    在生产过程中，不论基本操作或者辅助操作，都是用机械来进行，手工劳动仅限于极少的不大费力的工作（如操纵机器），这就叫做机械化。在机械化的基础上，如果更进一步采用自动控制、自动测量和自动调整的装置来操纵机器；或者说，从毛坯进入到成品送出都由机器自动地去完成，人只是从旁监督机器的正常运转，那就叫做自动化。部分的、不完整的机械化和自动化，分别被称为半机械化和半自动化。因此，自动化是机械化的进一步发展，是机械化的高级阶段。
    自动化按其应用范围来说，又可分为设备自动化和综合自动化。设备自动化，也称单机自动化，是指单个工作机器的自动化；它是综合自动化的基础。综合自动化，主要是指自动化生产线、自动化车间和自动化工厂等，它是自动化的最高形式。在单机自动化的基础上，用自动运输装置按工艺过程把有关的自动机联系在一起，并采用自动测量、自动调整装置去完成某种工件的全部制造过程时，叫做自动生产线。如果自动生产线的范围进一步扩大到全车间或全工厂，那就是自动化车间和自动化工厂了。
    自动化具有比机械化更高的劳动生产率，它同时还能改进产品质量和改善劳动条件。
