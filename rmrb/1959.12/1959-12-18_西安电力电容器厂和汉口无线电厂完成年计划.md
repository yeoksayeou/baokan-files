Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 16th: The Xi'an Electrical Capacitor Factory, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and vigorously promoting mass movements, overcame material shortages and comprehensively overfulfilled this year's plan by the end of November. Among them, total output value exceeded by 19.29%, product output exceeded by 23.03%, all product variety plans were completed, product quality all met national requirements, cost was reduced by 13.41% compared to the plan, labor productivity increased by 19.7% compared to the plan, and profits turned over exceeded the plan by 24.48%. In order to meet the needs of the continuously developing electric power industry, this factory also successfully trial-produced twenty-six new products this year.

The Xi'an Electrical Capacitor Factory was officially put into production in July 1958. Due to its persistence in vigorously promoting mass movements, it reached its design capacity in less than a year after being put into production. The products produced by the factory from January to November this year exceeded the original designed annual output by 16.8%.

The comprehensive overfulfillment of the annual plan by the Xi'an Electrical Capacitor Factory is the result of adhering to putting politics in command and vigorously promoting mass movements. Due to the continuous increase in output, the supply of raw materials for this factory was insufficient this year. At the beginning, some cadres believed that "even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice" and developed a fear of difficulties in continuing the Great Leap Forward. The Party committee led all the factory workers to criticize this right-leaning conservative thinking through extensive airing of views, debates, and discussions, and put forward the call to "increase revenue and reduce expenditure" to solve the problem of raw materials. To this end, all the factory workers actively carried out technological innovation. They used methods such as saving materials, trying out substitute materials, and finding new sources of materials to produce more and better products. For example, technician Li Qingxian and workers jointly studied and modified the design of the phase-shifting capacitor, which increased the capacitor's capacity by 20% compared to the original, while ensuring quality and without increasing raw materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 17th: The Hankou Radio Factory has completed its annual production tasks ahead of schedule and in an all-round and over-fulfilled manner, achieving an all-round leap forward of high output, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, and safety. As of the 15th of this month, the factory's annual planned output value has been completed by 111.3%, commodity output value has been completed by 126%, labor productivity has been completed by 112.8%, cost has been reduced by 21.34% compared to the plan, and profit has been completed by 154%. The fifteen product varieties and outputs included in the state plan have all completed or overfulfilled the plan, and the product quality meets the national standards. In terms of safe production, the factory has not had a major personal injury accident or equipment accident since the beginning of this year.

In the process of leading all factory workers to achieve a comprehensive leap forward this year, the factory's Party committee has firmly grasped the central link of comprehensively completing the state plan, and has consistently used the spirit of the General Line to inspect production and work. In the first quarter of this year, the factory's Party committee put forward the slogan of "A tall building starts from the ground, and the quality of the building depends on the foundation" to all the factory workers, and put forward specific goals, leading the workers to successfully complete the quarterly production tasks. In April, the factory's Party committee launched a socialist competition centered on high quality, high output, low consumption, and safety, comprehensively completed the state plan, and realized the guarantee of offering gifts to "May Day." In June, the factory's Party committee proposed to comprehensively complete the state plan every month and offer gifts to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. After the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, the Party committee mobilized all the factory workers to exert even greater efforts, thereby promoting the monthly increase in production and ensuring the early completion of the annual production tasks.

    西安电力电容器厂和汉口无线电厂完成年计划
    据新华社西安16日电　西安电力电容器厂坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，克服材料不足的困难，在11月底全面超额完成今年计划。其中，总产值超额19.29％，产品产量超额23.03％，品种计划全部完成，产品质量都达到国家要求，成本比计划降低13.41％，劳动生产率比计划提高19.7％，上缴利润超过计划24.48％。为了适应电力工业不断发展的需要，这个厂今年还试制成功二十六种新产品。
    西安电力电容器厂是在1958年7月正式投入生产的，由于坚持大搞群众运动，投入生产不到一年就达到了设计能力。今年1至11月份全厂生产的产品，比原设计的年产量还多16.8％。
    西安电力电容器厂全面超额完成全年计划，是坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的结果。由于产量不断增加，今年这个工厂的原料材料供应不足。开始时，有些干部认为“巧妇难为无米之炊”，对继续跃进产生畏难情绪。党委领导全厂职工，通过大鸣大放大辩论，批判了这种右倾保守思想，提出“开源节流”解决原料材料的号召。全厂职工为此积极开展技术革新，他们用节约材料、试用代用材料和寻找新的材料来源等办法，生产出又多又好的产品。例如技术员李庆先和工人共同研究，修改了移相电容器的设计，在保证质量和不增加原料材料的情况下，使电容器的容量比原来增加20％。
    新华社武汉17日电　汉口无线电厂提前全面超额完成了全年生产任务，实现了高产、优质、多品种、低成本和安全的全面跃进。到本月15日止，全厂年度计划产值已完成111.3％，商品产值完成126％，劳动生产率完成112.8％，成本比计划降低21.34％，利润完成154％；列入国家计划的十五种产品品种及产量，都完成或超额完成了计划，而且产品质量合乎国家规定标准。在安全生产方面，今年以来全厂没有发生一次较大的人身事故和设备事故。
    这个厂的党委在领导全厂职工实现今年全面跃进的过程中，紧紧抓住全面完成国家计划这一中心环节，始终不渝地以总路线精神来检查生产和工作。今年第一季度，厂党委向全厂职工提出了“万丈高楼从地起，高楼好坏在打基”的口号，并且提出了具体的奋斗目标，领导职工胜利地完成了季度生产任务。4月份，厂党委发动全厂职工开展了以优质高产低耗安全为中心的社会主义竞赛，全面完成了国家计划，实现了向“五一”献礼的保证。6月份，厂党委提出要月月全面完成国家计划，向建国十周年献礼的号召。党的八届八中全会的号召发出之后，党委又动员全厂职工鼓足了更大的干劲，从而促进生产月月上升，保证了全年生产任务的提前完成。
