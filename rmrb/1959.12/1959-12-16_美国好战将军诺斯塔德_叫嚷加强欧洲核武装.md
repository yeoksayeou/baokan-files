Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 12th: According to TASS, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, U.S. General Norstad, recently delivered a speech in the United States. The full text of the speech has now been released by his headquarters. In his speech, Norstad raised the question of entrusting all existing nuclear weapons in Europe to a "multi-national nuclear agency" for supervision. This agency would be composed of the fifteen member states of NATO.

Norstad clamored that "the potential of modern defense is built on the basis of atomic weapons." He said, "The defense of Europe relies on such weapons."

From Norstad's speech, it can be seen that Norstad had to admit that "the intentions of NATO member states on the issue of nuclear weapons are mutually contradictory." In order to maintain and strengthen this aggressive bloc, Norstad suggested that the supervision of nuclear weapons be handed over to NATO, with the United States and West Germany playing a major role in its implementation.

    美国好战将军诺斯塔德
    叫嚷加强欧洲核武装
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社巴黎12日讯：北大西洋公约组织驻欧洲部队最高司令、美国将军诺斯塔德不久前在美国发表了一席讲话，讲话全文现在已由其司令部公布。诺斯塔德讲话中提出了这样一个问题：把欧洲现有的核武器统统交给一个“由许多国家组成的核机构”来监督。这个机构由北大西洋公约组织十五个成员国参加。
    诺斯塔德叫喊说，“现代防御的潜力是建筑在原子武器基础上的”。他说，“保卫欧洲就要依靠这种武器”。
    从诺斯塔德的讲话中可以看出，诺斯塔德不得不承认“北大西洋公约组织成员国之间在核武器问题上的打算是相互矛盾的”。为了维持并加强这个侵略集团，诺斯塔德建议把对核武器的监督交由北大西洋公约组织执行，美国和西德在执行方面起主要的作用。
