Repairing Leather Shoes with Machines
    Washing Old Cotton Without Hands
    The leather shoe repair and old cotton washing industries, which have always relied on manual labor, have blossomed with technological innovations in Beijing.
    Sun Wenyuan, a worker at the shoe repair shop in Haidian District located at Peking University, used old clock springs to create blades and formed them into a shoe sole shape, creating a simple blanking die to replace manual blanking. This not only increases efficiency fivefold but also saves materials and ensures quality.
    Jiang Zhongfu, Zhang Chun, and Zhang Qingquan, members of the Xuanwu District Cotton Ginning Cooperative, jointly made an electric rotating drum to replace the manual labor of washing old cotton on a washboard. Previously, twenty-six people could only wash 300 jin of cotton per day, but now with the rotating drum, only six people are needed to wash 400 jin per day.

    修理皮鞋有机具
    洗旧棉花不用手
    一向是纯手工操作的皮便鞋修理和洗旧棉花行业，在北京开出了技术革新的花朵。
    海淀区设在北京大学里的修鞋部工人孙文元用旧钟条打出刃，围成鞋掌型，制成一个简单的下料模子，代替了手工下料，不但提高效率五倍，而且能够节约材料、保证质量。
    宣武区弹花合作社社员姜忠福、张春、张清泉三人合制了一个电动转鼓，代替了手工在挫板上洗旧棉花的体力劳动。过去二十六个人每天只能洗棉花三百斤，现在用转鼓，每天只用六个人就可以洗四百斤。
