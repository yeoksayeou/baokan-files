    Uphold the Mass Line From Beginning to End

    A large-scale upsurge in water conservancy construction has already been launched in the broad countryside. How can water conservancy construction be carried out even better? Everyone participating in water conservancy construction is concerned about this issue. Many construction sites have already devised methods, found experiences, and achieved results in this regard.

    In order to carry out water conservancy construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, during the construction process, many construction sites actively improve labor organization, fully utilize the strengths of each individual, and truly ensure that everyone has something to do and everything is managed. Many construction sites mobilize the masses and vigorously carry out tool reforms, which have increased labor efficiency by multiples. The experience of Leinan County, Guangdong Province, introduced in this newspaper today, of extensively mobilizing the masses and absorbing them into the design process is another good method and good experience for achieving greater success in water conservancy construction.

    Leinan County's adherence to the mass line in design work, formulating engineering design plans in accordance with local conditions, has saved a large amount of manpower and material resources, improved engineering quality, and shortened construction time. According to the ten designs that have already been revised, it can save 20 tons of steel, more than 3,000 bags of cement, and 130 cubic meters of wood. More importantly, because the design is more scientific and reasonable, it saves a large amount of earth and stone work, thereby saving 950,000 workdays. This fact tells us that making the design plan better and more scientific is a very important aspect of implementing the principle of building more, faster, better, and more economically.

    Leinan County's experience also vividly illustrates that as long as we follow the mass line in the design process and effectively implement the "three combinations" of scientific and technical personnel, the masses, and leaders, we can make the design plan better. Whether the engineering design is good or not has many conditions or standards, but whether this design is suitable for local conditions and whether it saves the most manpower and material resources while achieving greater benefits is a fundamental standard. To achieve this, it is not only necessary to have the scientific knowledge of the design personnel, but also the experience and wisdom of the broad masses. The masses are the most familiar with their hometowns. They know where there is water, where canals can be opened, and where reservoirs can be built. They know where the terrain is high and where the terrain is low, and how to arrange canals and reservoirs most rationally. The construction of water conservancy requires a lot of equipment, and the masses know which mountains have stones, where quarries can be mined, and where lime kilns can be built. The leading cadres of Leinan County went deep into the Longmen Reservoir construction site, widely solicited the opinions of the masses, and according to the opinions of the masses, changed the original filling project in one place to an excavation project. The quality of the project was not only more solid, but it could also save a lot of steel and concrete, reduce the use of 300,000 workdays, and complete the entire project one and a half months ahead of schedule.

    It can be seen from the facts of Leinan County that not only should the masses be mobilized and relied upon in the construction process, but also the mass line should be followed in the design process, and the masses should be absorbed into the design work. Only by implementing the mass line from beginning to end can the water conservancy construction this winter and next spring be carried out in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

### 自始至终贯彻群众路线

    自始至终贯彻群众路线
    广大农村已经掀起了大规模水利建设高潮。怎样才能把水利建设搞得更好？每一个参加水利建设的人都关心这个问题，很多工地在这方面已经想出了办法，找到了经验，取得了成绩。
    为了多快好省地进行水利建设，在施工过程中，许多工地积极改善劳动组织，充分发挥每一个人的特长，真正作到人人有事做，事事有人管；许多工地发动群众，大闹工具改革，使劳动效率成倍、几倍地提高。今天本报介绍的广东省雷南县在设计过程中，广泛发动群众，吸收群众参加设计，这又是一个使水利建设获得更大成就的好办法，好经验。
    雷南县在设计工作中走群众路线，因地制宜制定工程设计方案，节省了大批人力物力，提高了工程质量，缩短了建设时间。仅据已经修改的十宗设计来看，就可以节省钢筋二十吨、水泥三千多包、木材一百三十立方，尤其重要的是由于设计更加科学合理，节省了大量的土石方，从而节省了九十五万个劳动日。这个事实告诉我们，把设计方案制定得更好更科学，是贯彻多快好省建设方针的一个十分重要的方面。
    雷南县的经验还生动地说明：只要在设计过程中走群众路线，很好地实行科学技术人员、群众和领导“三结合”，就能把设计方案制定得更好。工程设计好不好，有很多条件或标准，但是这个设计是否适合当地的条件，是否最节省人力物力而又能发挥更大的效益，却是一个根本的标准。要做到这一点，固然需要设计人员的科学知识，同时也需要广大群众的经验和智慧。群众是最熟悉自己家乡的，他们知道哪里有水源，哪里可以开渠、修水库；他们知道哪里地势高、哪里地势低，渠道和水库怎样安排才最合理；修水利需要很多器材，群众知道哪个山里有石头，哪里能开采石场，哪里能建石灰窑。雷南县的领导干部深入龙门水库工地，广泛征求群众意见，并根据群众意见把原设计的一处填方工程换了一个位置，改为挖方工程，工程质量不仅更加坚实，还可以节省大量钢筋和混凝土，少用三十万个劳动日，使整个工程提早一个半月完工。
    从雷南县的事实可以看出，不仅在施工过程中要发动群众、依靠群众，在设计过程中同样要走群众路线，吸收群众参加设计工作。只有自始至终地贯彻群众路线，才能使今冬明春的水利建设进行得更加多快好省。
