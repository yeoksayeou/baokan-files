People's Commune Investigation

    Public Canteen Forever Red
    — The Emergence and Development of the Public Canteen in Hongguang People's Commune, Pixian County, Sichuan
    Investigation Team of the Rural Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, has 16,982 households, 75,752 people, and 134,000 mu of cultivated land. The terrain here is flat, and the soil is fertile. It belongs to the famous Dujiangyan self-flowing irrigation area, which mainly produces rice, wheat, and rapeseed. People praise this area as the "Heavenly Land of Heavenly Land." With the development of production and the establishment of the people's commune, public canteens have been universally established. Over the past year, these public canteens have overcome some difficulties in the initial period and have become better and better, playing a huge role in promoting the development of production and organizing the lives of commune members.

      From Busy Season Canteens to Year-Round Canteens
    In order to start work early, have everyone present, and do more work, before the establishment of public canteens, "rotating meals" were popular in this area: working at Zhang's house meant eating at Zhang's house, working at Li's house meant eating at Li's house. The cost of meals was deducted from the exchange of labor compensation, or commune members brought rice and vegetables to cook and eat together. During the period of agricultural production cooperatives, especially after advanced agricultural collectivization, in order to seize the season and save time, forms such as "eating collective meals," "eating labor meals" (commune members participating in production eating collectively), and "busy season canteens" appeared in many production teams or production groups. In 1958, the production upsurge came one after another, and the amount of labor used increased exponentially, and the phenomenon of labor shortage became more prominent. Busy season canteens appeared in all of the original sixty advanced cooperatives.
    As soon as the people's commune was established, it organized a group of laborers to go to the mountains to smelt steel and iron and built fifty indigenous blast furnaces. The variety of diversified business projects expanded from the original five to more than twenty. Soil fertilizer plants, pesticide plants, brick and tile plants, chemical plants, wineries, and agricultural and sideline product processing plants were also established. At the same time, an autumn harvest, autumn storage, autumn plowing, and autumn planting campaign was launched on the agricultural front, and the demand for labor increased greatly. Under such circumstances, year-round public canteens replaced busy season canteens. The entire commune established 432 public canteens. Most of these canteens were established based on production teams, with the largest canteen including 126 households and the smallest 16 households, generally around 40 households.

      Public Canteen "Five Satisfactions"
    Once the public canteens were established, they immediately demonstrated unparalleled superiority in promoting production development and improving the lives of commune members.
    The establishment of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens completely liberated women, who accounted for half of the commune's population, from household chores, and their social and economic status was further enhanced. More than 17,000 female laborers who were originally unable to work or unable to work full-time, freed from the shackles of tedious housework,投入了田间生产 (invested in field production). More than 60% of the labor force participating in the autumn harvest in 1959 were women, and they could receive their due share of remuneration like male commune members. With the improvement of women's socio-economic status, their labor enthusiasm soared, and production technology progressed rapidly. Among the 54 women in the 10th production team of the Xingfu Management Area, about 70% learned new production techniques, of which nearly half learned rice transplanting, while in 1958, only three people in this team could transplant rice.
    Bachelors no longer have to worry about cooking. Jiang Zijin, a bachelor in the Dongfeng Management Area, before the commune set up a canteen, often cooked for two or three days at a time in order to earn more work points and save firewood, and eight out of ten meals were leftovers. After the establishment of the public canteen, he could eat fresh meals every time and was very satisfied.
    Commune members eat in the public canteen, eating both full, good, and hygienic meals. Some public canteens also have small shops selling wine, cigarettes, and daily necessities, and 95% of the canteens are equipped with loudspeakers. After working, commune members sit in the canteen, eating while listening to the loudspeakers broadcasting domestic and foreign news and music. Such a happy and pleasant life can only be obtained after the establishment of public canteens. The masses said that the public canteen has "five satisfactions": women are satisfied, no longer confined to the house; heads of households are satisfied, no longer worry about oil, salt, firewood, and rice; bachelors are satisfied, no longer have to cook and wash dishes themselves, and can concentrate on production; cadres are satisfied, no longer running from house to house when arranging work; young people are satisfied, have more time to study culture and entertainment.

      Cannot Be Blown Down by the Wind, Cannot Be Scattered by Thunder
    When the broad masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, warmly support and actively support the public canteens, a very small number of rich middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas come out to make waves. They oppose the implementation of the distribution system that combines the wage system and the supply system, saying that the public canteen is "not free." The destructive words and deeds of these people aroused the righteous indignation of the broad masses of commune members, and the masses posted many big-character posters, praising and defending their canteens. One of the big-character posters wrote: "The rice is fragrant, the vegetables are fragrant, don't forget the Communist Party when you pick up your chopsticks; work hard and cleverly, strive for ten thousand catties per mu." The rich peasants were not satisfied with the public canteens and made strange remarks, which were refuted by the commune members anytime and anywhere. Hu Zhongxian, an old upper-middle peasant, deliberately asked the commune member Zhou Yucai, "Are you full?" while working in the field one day. Zhou Yucai retorted to Hu Zhongxian: "If I am not full, can I save so much grain?" Hu Zhongxian was left speechless. Those who oppose public canteens are not only isolated among the masses, but even isolated in their families. For example, Zheng Gongpin, a new upper-middle peasant in the first production team of the Shuanggui Management Area, has a family of four. His father and mother suffered half their lives of poverty in the old society and have a deep understanding of the happy life since the establishment of the commune. They are willing to participate in the public canteen, but Zheng Gongpin is unwilling to participate, so he is often criticized and educated by his parents.
    The public canteens can be run very well and receive warm support from the broad masses because the commune Party committee has strengthened leadership and adopted effective measures. In the process of running public canteens, the commune Party committee determined that the first secretary of the Party committee should lead this work. The Party branches and branches of each production team also designated a secretary to manage the canteen work. Each canteen has democratically elected cooks who have good backgrounds, good thinking, active work, good health, and certain cooking skills. The commune and various management areas often hold on-site meetings to exchange experiences and train cooks.
    According to the distribution system that combines the wage system and the supply system, the public canteen also implemented the "contracting both ends" food supply method, that is, implementing the food supply system for the elderly who have lost their ability to work and children who have no ability to work. For commune members who have the ability to work, food basic work points of different levels are assessed according to the strength of the labor force. Those who do enough basic work points do not need to pay for meals, and those who do not do enough need to pay a certain amount of food expenses. This method encourages commune members with the ability to work to work actively, and implements social insurance and collective mutual assistance for those without the ability to work, and thus receives warm support from the vast majority of commune members. In terms of saving grain, the canteen implemented the principle of "quantifying according to people, distributing to households, eating in the canteen, and saving for oneself," so as to ensure that one eats more during busy farming seasons and less during slack seasons, and to ensure that one eats full, eats well, saves, is hygienic, and uses grain in a planned way. The 356 households and 1,658 people in the Shuanggui Management Area saved 1,999 catties of grain in August 1959.
    According to the instructions of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the beginning of the establishment of the public canteen, the commune allocated an average of five li of vegetable base per person to the canteen and designated a special person to manage it. These vegetable plots, planted with dozens of varieties throughout the year, produce more than 10,000 catties per mu, which not only ensures the vegetable needs of the canteen but also provides a large number of commercial vegetables, increasing the canteen's income, and there is money to buy oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar. The canteen vegetable plot of the first production team of the Hongguang Management Area, in addition to supplying commune members with vegetables, also supplied more than 30,000 catties to the market, increasing income by more than 1,200 yuan. Piggeries have been set up around the public canteens. The canteens and production teams jointly raised more than 35,400 pigs, an increase of 12,500 over before the establishment of the commune. In addition, each canteen also raised chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits. In the past year, the commune sold more pigs and poultry to the state than in any previous year, the commune members' meat consumption increased, and their income also increased.
    In order to take care of the convenience of commune members' lives, the commune also retained restaurants, tea houses, various workshops, and small stoves for commune members. In addition to the vegetables eaten in the canteen, some vegetables were also distributed to commune members, allowing them to take them home to cook the dishes they wanted to eat. During the Spring Festival, each canteen held a dinner party and also distributed some rice, pork, and vegetables to commune members to take care of the needs of commune members to visit relatives and friends. The public canteen took appropriate care of the elderly, young, sick, weak, pregnant women, and new mothers, allowing them to take meals home to eat and making soft meals for the elderly and children. The elderly, weak, pregnant women, new mothers, and patients who had difficulty walking could also cook their own meals at home. The canteen managers also regularly delivered the grain and vegetables allocated to them to their doorsteps. Xiong Damao, who is more than 70 years old in the Satellite Management Area, was very touched when the canteen manager brought her rice and vegetables, saying: "In the past, when we were one household at a time, we could not carry the distributed grain, and it was troublesome to ask someone to move it. Now someone delivers it to the door. The public canteen is so good!"
    With the great development of production, the material strength of the public canteen is increasing day by day, and various facilities are also improving. Over the past year, each canteen has not only had spacious kitchens and dining rooms, but also repaired many pigsties, raised many pigs and small poultry, and established vegetable bases. Many canteens have begun to reform cooking utensils, such as installing indigenous tap water pipes, and self-made sweet potato slicers and radish shredders. This work will be vigorously carried out in the future to gradually realize the semi-mechanization of cooking utensils. These have shown a bright future for the public canteen.
    The broad masses of commune members love collective life, and they take great care of the canteen and enthusiastically demand to participate in the canteen's voluntary labor. They are tired all day in the fields, and they voluntarily repair the houses for the canteen at night. Some commune members also planted fruit trees, flowers, and plants around the canteen to beautify the canteen environment. Now the public canteen has taken root firmly in the hearts of the commune members, and they all say: "The people's commune is the east wind, and the public canteen will be forever red!"

    公共食堂万年红
    ——四川郫县红光公社公共食堂的产生和发展
    中共四川省委农村工作部调查组
    四川郫县红光人民公社有一万六千九百八十二户，七万五千七百五十二人，有耕地十三万四千亩。这里地势平坦，土壤肥沃，属于著名的都江堰自流灌溉区，主产水稻、小麦、油菜，人们赞美这一带为“天府之天府”。随着生产的发展，人民公社的成立，公共食堂普遍建立起来。一年来，这些公共食堂克服了初办时期的一些困难，越办越好，对促进生产的发展和组织社员的生活，发挥了巨大的作用。
      从农忙食堂到常年食堂
    为了出工早、出工齐、多做活路，没有建立公共食堂以前，这一带就盛行吃“转转饭”：在张家干活就在张家吃饭，在李家干活就在李家吃饭，吃饭费用在换工的报酬中扣除，或者由社员带米带菜，在一起合着做合着吃。在农业生产合作社时期，特别是高级农业合作化以后，为了赶季节、抢时间，“吃集体伙食”、“吃劳动饭”（参加生产的社员集体吃饭）、“农忙食堂”等形式，就在许多生产队或生产小组里出现了。1958年，生产高潮一个接一个，用工量成倍地增加，劳动力紧张的现象更为突出。农忙食堂在原来的六十个高级社内都出现了。
    人民公社一成立，就组织了一批劳动力上山炼钢、炼铁，建起了五十座土高炉；多种经营项目由原来的五种扩大到二十多种；土化肥厂、农药厂、砖瓦厂、化工厂、酿酒厂和农副产品加工厂等也建立起来了。同时，在农业战线上开展了秋收、秋藏、秋耕、秋种运动，劳动力需要量增加很大。在这种情况下，常年性的公共食堂代替了农忙食堂。全公社建立了四百三十二个公共食堂，这些食堂大多数是以生产小队为单位建立起来的，最大的食堂包括一百二十六户，最小的是十六户，一般是四十户左右。
      公共食堂“五满意”
    公共食堂一经建立，就在促进生产发展和改善社员生活方面，立即显示出无比的优越性。
    公共食堂和托儿所、幼儿园的建立，使得占公社人口一半的妇女从家务劳动中彻底解放了出来，他们的社会地位和经济地位更加提高。原来根本不能出工或不能全天出工的一万七千多个妇女劳动力，摆脱了繁琐的家务拖累，投入了田间生产。1959年参加秋收的劳动力60％以上是妇女，她们能和男社员一样领取自己应得的一份报酬。妇女的社会经济地位提高了，劳动热情空前高涨，生产技术进步很快。幸福管理区第十生产小队的五十四个妇女中，学会了新的生产技术的约占70％，其中学会栽秧的人占将近一半，而1958年这个小队只有三个人栽秧。
    单身汉也不再为做饭吃发愁了。东风管理区单身汉江子金，在公社办食堂以前，为了多做些工分和省一些柴火，经常是一次做出两三天的饭，十顿饭中有八顿吃剩的。公共食堂建立以后，他顿顿能吃到新鲜饭菜，非常满意。
    社员在公共食堂吃饭，吃得又饱、又好、又卫生。有一部分公共食堂还设了卖酒、买烟、卖日用品的小卖部，有95％的食堂装有广播喇叭。社员劳动后，坐在食堂里，边吃饭，边听喇叭播送国内外新闻和音乐。这样幸福愉快的生活，只有办起了公共食堂才得到的。群众说公共食堂有“五满意”：妇女满意，再不缠在屋里打转转了；当家人满意，再也不愁油盐柴米了；单身汉满意，不用自己煮饭洗碗，可以一心一意搞生产了；干部满意，安排活路时不再一家一户跑了；青年人满意，有更多的时间学习文化和娱乐了。
      风吹不倒　雷打不散
    当广大群众特别是贫苦农民热烈拥护、积极支持公共食堂的时候，极少数资本主义思想严重的富裕中农出来兴风作浪，他们反对实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，说公共食堂“不自由”。这些人的破坏言行激起了广大社员的义愤，群众贴出了许多大字报，赞扬和保卫自己的食堂。其中有一张大字报上写的是：“饭香菜香，举筷不忘共产党；苦干巧干，力争亩产万斤粮”。富裕农民对公共食堂不满意，讲怪话，随时随地受到社员们的驳斥。老上中农胡仲贤，有一天在田里做活路时故意问社员周玉才：“你吃饱没有？”周玉才反问胡仲贤：“吃不饱，我还能节约那样多的粮食？”问得胡仲贤哑口无言。反对公共食堂的人，不仅在群众中是孤立的，甚至在家庭中也是孤立的。如双桂管理区第一生产队的新上中农郑功品，全家四口人，他的父亲和母亲在旧社会曾经受过半辈子的穷苦生活，对建立公社以来的幸福生活体会较深，愿意参加公共食堂，只有郑功品不愿意参加，因此他经常受到父母的批评和教育。
    公共食堂能够办得很好，受到广大群众的热烈拥护和支持，是由于公社党委加强了领导，采取了有效措施。在举办公共食堂的过程中，公社党委确定党委第一书记领导这一工作。各个生产队的党总支和支部也指定一个书记管理食堂工作。各个食堂都通过民主选举，选出了成分好、思想好、工作积极、身体健康、有一定烹调技术的炊事人员。公社和各管理区经常召开现场会议，交流经验，训练炊事员。
    按照工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，公共食堂还实行了“包两头”的伙食供给办法，即对丧失劳动能力的老年人和没有劳动能力的儿童实行伙食供给制。对有劳动能力的社员，按劳动力的强弱评定高低不等的伙食基本工分，做够基本工分的人吃饭不要钱，做不够的人需要补缴一定的伙食费。这个办法鼓励有劳动能力的社员积极劳动，对无劳动能力的人实行社会保险和集体互助，因而得到绝大多数社员的热烈拥护和支持。在节约用粮上，食堂贯彻执行了“以人定量，分配到户，食堂吃饭，节余归己”的原则，做到农忙多吃，农闲少吃和保证吃饱、吃好、节省、卫生，有计划地用粮。双桂管理区的三百五十六户，一千六百五十八人，1959年8月份节余粮食一千九百九十九斤。
    公社根据中共四川省委的指示，在公共食堂建立之初，就划给食堂平均每人五厘蔬菜基地，指定了专人管理。这些蔬菜地，一年中种植几十个品种，每亩产一万多斤，既保证了食堂的蔬菜需要，又提供了大批商品蔬菜，增加了食堂收入，购买油盐酱醋都有钱了。红光管理区第一生产队的食堂蔬菜地，除供给社员吃菜外，还供应市场三万多斤，增加收入一千二百多元。在公共食堂周围，都设立了养猪场。食堂与生产队共养了三万五千四百多头猪，比建立公社以前增加了一万二千五百头。此外，各个食堂还养了鸡鸭鹅兔。一年来公社出售给国家的猪、家禽比任何一年都多，社员的肉食量增加了，还增加了收入。
    为了照顾社员生活上的方便，公社还保留了饭馆、茶馆、各种作坊和社员的小锅小灶。除去食堂吃的蔬菜以外，还分给社员一些蔬菜，让他们拿回家去做自己想吃的菜。过春节时，各食堂都举行了会餐，还分发了一些大米、猪肉和蔬菜给社员，照顾社员探亲访友的需要。公共食堂对老、幼、病、弱和产妇、孕妇做到了适当的照顾，允许他们打饭回家去吃，并为老年人和小孩做软饭。走路不方便的老弱、产妇、孕妇和病人，也可以在家自己煮饭。食堂的管理员还定期把分给他们的粮食和蔬菜送上门去。卫星管理区七十多岁的熊大娘，当食堂管理员给她送米送菜去时，很感动地说：“过去一家一户的时候，分得的粮食背不动，拿不回去，求人搬，又麻烦，现在有人送上门，公共食堂就是好！”
    随着生产的大发展，公共食堂的物质力量日益增强，各项设备也日臻完善。一年来，各个食堂不只有了宽敞的厨房、餐室，还培修了不少猪圈，养了不少猪和小家禽，建立了蔬菜基地，不少食堂已开始改革炊事工具，如装置了土自来水管，自制红苕切片机、萝卜切丝机，今后还要大力开展这项工作，逐步实现炊事工具半机械化。这些，都为公共食堂展示了美好的前景。
    广大社员热爱集体生活，他们对食堂爱护备至，热烈要求参加食堂的义务劳动。他们白天在地里劳累了一天，夜里还自愿给食堂修缮房屋。有些社员还在食堂周围栽种了果木花草，美化食堂环境。现在公共食堂已经在社员的心里扎下了牢固的根子，他们都说：“人民公社是东风，公共食堂万年红！”
