This newspaper Hangzhou, 22nd December - Zhejiang Province is experiencing a surge in communes and teams establishing collective pig farms. By the end of November, communes, production brigades, production teams, and production groups across the province had set up more than 125,000 pig farms. Approximately 60% of these have been established in just the last two months. Currently, the number of publicly raised pigs in the province has increased by more than 660,000 compared to October.

Communes across Zhejiang Province have been using facts, setting up model examples, and summarizing local experiences in running collective livestock farms to promote the many advantages of collective livestock farms, such as raising more pigs, raising them well, faster meat growth, and lower costs. This has greatly increased the enthusiasm of the members in developing collective pig raising. The Ningbo area launched a mass movement to establish livestock farms, increasing the number of pig farms from more than 16,000 to more than 36,000 in just over two months.

In the large-scale establishment of livestock farms, communes and teams have generally implemented the principle of thrift, making the most of existing conditions, using local materials, fully utilizing existing old houses and vacant houses for renovation, or having the commune's masons and carpenters build earth walls and thatched houses as pigsties, ensuring that the construction of livestock farms meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. The more than 10,000 newly built pigsties in Chun'an County's communes were all built using old houses and materials.

Building farms in the fields and putting pig farms on the mountains are prominent features of the large-scale establishment of livestock farms in Zhejiang. Communes and production teams throughout the province have utilized orchards, bamboo gardens, tea gardens, mulberry gardens, and mountains, fields, and hillsides to establish simple pig farms. Currently, more than 10,000 pig farms in the province are built on mountains or in fields. These pig farms are widely welcomed by the masses. Many members say that mountain and field pig farms have four major benefits: convenient collection of feed, easy access to water and firewood, labor-saving in manure accumulation and delivery, and separation of humans and animals for cleanliness and hygiene.

After communes and teams in Zhejiang Province established pig farms, they have taken various measures to strengthen leadership. Party committees at the county and commune levels have recently transferred a group of Party and Youth League members and outstanding cadres to work in the pig farms or as feeders.

This newspaper Nanchang, 22nd December - Jiangxi is vigorously developing collective ownership breeding farms and developing livestock production centered on pig raising. In the past two months, the province has established more than 70,000 collective breeding farms, averaging sixty farms per commune; the number of live pigs has increased by 1.64 million compared to September and by 1 million compared to October. At the same time, the province's poultry farming has also developed to 50 million birds.

In October, Jiangxi Province actively raised pigs by adopting the method of "four-level farm construction and five-level breeding." Communes, brigades, production teams, and public canteens vigorously established collective ownership breeding farms at four levels, and communes, brigades, production teams, public canteens, and members all worked together to breed at five levels. In the past two months, the Shangrao area mobilized members to build 10,115 breeding farms, achieving a breeding farm in every commune, team, and canteen. The total number of publicly and privately raised pigs in the area has reached 1.78 million, an increase of two times compared to September.

Party secretaries at all levels in Jiangxi personally took command and strengthened leadership in livestock production. The Provincial Party Committee established a Livestock Production Development Committee, with Liu Junxiu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, serving as the director of the committee. The secretaries of Party organizations at all levels in charge of agriculture personally took charge of the leadership. Party organizations in many areas of the province also used telephone conferences, on-site meetings, and other methods to specifically arrange and arrange pig raising and other livestock production and exchange and promote advanced experiences. Party organization secretaries and cadres at all levels also universally carried out pig-raising "experimental fields" to discover and solve the difficulties and problems in running farms, as well as explore and summarize farm-running experiences.

In the large-scale establishment of collective breeding farms, Jiangxi, on the one hand, gave full play to the superior conditions of the communes, and on the other hand, mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and plans, and widely adopted the "poor method" of building farms. Communes used the advantageous condition of having more manpower in the communes, drawing labor to organize construction commando teams, which solved the manpower problem; relying on members to build sheds in a simple manner solved the pig shed and chicken coop problem. Communes in the Jiujiang area organized members to find ways to build farms thriftily, using only a small amount of manpower and equipment to build 5,369 pigsties.

The massive increase in breeding farms requires a sufficient supply of pigs and feed. Jiangxi promptly solved these problems. In terms of pig sources, in addition to drawing funds to purchase a batch of piglets, communes widely promoted effective experiences: implementing "double mating and re-mating" for sows to increase the conception rate of sows and produce more piglets; implementing the "first-born sow" system to increase the number of sows. In terms of feed, localities, following the principle of relying on the mountains and water, adopted the following methods: breeding farms established feed bases and planted feed crops; collected wild feed; propagated aquatic feed; established feed processing plants; and reserved an appropriate amount of concentrated feed.

Many areas had not run breeding farms in the past and lacked management experience, so they focused on strengthening this work. Leping County sent 1,650 Party members, Youth League members, and activists to serve as Party branch secretaries, farm managers, and feeders in the newly built 1,000 breeding farms, strengthening the leadership of the farms and establishing and improving the management system of the farms, so that each breeding farm was run well. In addition, epidemic prevention networks have been universally established throughout the province. Counties have veterinary stations, communes have veterinary stations, brigades have veterinary rooms, and production teams have veterinary groups. Every breeding farm has a "pig doctor" who treats diseases when they occur and prevents epidemics when there are no diseases, preventing pig diseases.

　　高速发展养猪业的好办法
    浙江江西遍建养猪场
    浙江建场十二万个江西建场七万个
    本报杭州22日电　浙江省各地掀起了社社、队队大办集体养猪场的热潮。到11月底止，全省公社、生产大队、生产队和生产小队已办起养猪场十二万五千多个。其中，60％左右都是最近两个多月来新办起来的。目前，全省公养猪的数量比10月份增加了六十六万多头。
    浙江省各地公社都通过摆事实、立标兵和总结当地办集体畜牧场的经验，宣传集体畜牧场养猪多、养得好、长肉快、成本省等许多优越性，大大提高了社员们发展集体养猪的积极性。宁波专区开展了群众性的大办畜牧场运动，两个多月来养猪场由一万六千多个增加到三万六千多个。
    各地社、队在大办畜牧场中，普遍贯彻执行勤俭办场方针，因陋就简，就地取材，充分利用原有的旧屋、空屋加以整修，或由公社的泥水匠、木匠筑土墙，搭草房作猪舍，做到兴建畜牧场符合多快好省的要求。淳安县各公社新建的一万多个猪舍全部是利用旧屋、旧料修建起来的。
    田间建场、猪场上山，是浙江各地大办畜牧场的一个突出的特点。各地公社、生产队都利用果园、竹园、茶园、桑园和山地、田头，建立简易的养猪场，目前全省共有一万多养猪场建在山上或田头。这种养猪场受到群众普遍欢迎，很多社员反映山地、田头猪场有四大好处：采集饲料方便、用水用柴容易、积肥送肥省劳力、人畜分居清洁卫生。
    浙江省社社、队队办起养猪场后，都采取各种措施加强领导，各县、公社党委新近调派了一批党、团员和优秀干部去养猪场工作或当饲养员。
    本报南昌22日电　江西大办集体所有制的饲养场，发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产。全省在两个月来办起了七万多个集体饲养场，平均每个公社有六十个饲养场；生猪比9月份增加了一百六十四万头，比10月份增加了一百万头。同时，全省饲养家禽也发展到五千万只。
    10月份，江西省各地采取“四级建场、五级饲养”的办法积极养猪，公社、大队、生产队和公共食堂四级大办集体所有制的饲养场，公社、大队、生产队、公共食堂、社员五级一齐动手饲养。两个月来，上饶专区发动社员兴建了一万零一百一十五个饲养场，达到了社社、队队和每个食堂都有饲养场；全区公养私养的生猪已达一百七十八万头，比9月份增加了二倍。
    江西各级党委书记亲自挂帅，加强领导畜牧业生产。省委成立了发展畜牧业生产委员会，省委书记刘俊秀担任委员会主任。各级党组织管农业的书记亲自负责领导。全省许多地区的党组织还运用电话会、现场会等方式，专门布置与安排养猪及其他畜牧业生产，交流与推广先进经验。各级党组织书记、干部还普遍搞了养猪“试验田”，发现并解决办场中的困难和问题，以及摸索与总结办场经验。
    在大办集体饲养场中，江西各地一面发挥公社的优越条件，一面发动群众出谋出计，广泛采取“穷办法”建场，各公社运用公社人力多的有利条件，抽出劳力组织建场突击队，解决了人力问题；依靠社员因陋就简兴建棚舍，解决了猪棚鸡舍问题。九江专区各公社组织社员找到勤俭建场的办法，只用了少量的人力、器材，就建立了五千三百六十九栋猪舍。
    饲养场大量增加，需要充足的猪源和饲料。江西各地及时解决了这些问题。在猪源方面，各公社除抽出资金购进了一批小猪外，广泛推行了行之有效的经验：实行母猪“双配、复配”，提高母猪受胎率，多产小猪；推行“一产母猪”制，增加母猪。在饲料方面，各地在靠山吃山、靠水吃水的原则下，采取了下面的办法：饲养场建立饲料基地，种植饲料作物；采集野生饲料；繁殖水生饲料；建立饲料加工厂；留足适量的精饲料。
    许多地区过去没有办过饲养场，缺乏管理经验，因此着重加强了这方面的工作。乐平县派了一千六百五十名党员、共青团员和积极分子，到新建的一千多个饲养场担任党支部书记、场长和饲养员，加强了场的领导，建立并健全了场的管理制度，使个个饲养场都办得很好。此外，各地还普遍建立了防疫网，县有兽医所，社有兽医站，大队有兽医室，生产队有兽医小组，个个饲养场有“猪医生”，有病治病，无病防疫，防止了生猪病疫。
