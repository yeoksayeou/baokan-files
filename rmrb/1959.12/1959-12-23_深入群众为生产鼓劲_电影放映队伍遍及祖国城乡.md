Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: To meet the ever-growing cultural needs of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country, a vibrant force for popularizing culture – film screening teams – is rapidly developing and growing stronger. Composed of more than 50,000 people, these teams are spread throughout the nation's towns, factories, mines, rural areas, and military units. Year-round, they brave hardships, travel across mountains and rivers to bring films to the doorsteps of workers, peasants, and soldiers, ensuring that even remote ethnic minority regions, small islands, and isolated mountain areas can enjoy movies. During this year's National Day 10th Anniversary New Domestic Film Exhibition Month, screening teams across the country swiftly delivered the latest celebratory films such as "Lin Zexu," "The New Story of an Old Soldier," "Young People in Our Village," "The Storm," "Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness," "Little Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate," and other excellent films to all parts of the country. In October, they created an unprecedented record of 540,000 screenings with 420 million viewers, including over 300 million rural viewers, enabling the broad masses to share in the joy of nationwide celebration.

Our country's film screening network has expanded from just over 600 cinemas concentrated in a few cities before liberation to nearly 15,000 screening units now (excluding military screening teams). Old cinemas, once tools for profit for the bourgeoisie, have been transformed into places of entertainment for the people. Modern, well-equipped new cinemas have been widely established, and film screening teams and film clubs catering to workers, peasants, and soldiers have developed on a large scale from scratch. The total number of film viewers nationwide is estimated to reach over 4 billion this year, an increase of 85 times compared to 1949, with workers and peasants accounting for about 80%. In Jiangsu Province, each person can now see an average of six films per year. In Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas, forest areas, factories, mines, and towns, more than 400 film screening units have been established. In the People's Liberation Army, over 90% of officers and soldiers can see four films a month. Many people's communes in various regions have established film screening teams.

For our country's 500 million peasants, film art has transformed from being completely unfamiliar in the past to becoming an urgently needed spiritual nourishment. The masses in various regions warmly welcome film screening teams that serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. When the first screening team in Shaanxi Province braved the biting cold to screen films in remote mountain villages in northern Shaanxi, the masses beat gongs and drums, and set off firecrackers to welcome them from more than ten miles away. Many peasants traveled from dozens or even hundreds of miles away to see "Chairman Mao's films." When young projectionists in Lin County, Henan Province, at the eastern foot of the Taihang Mountains, carried disassembled machine parts over treacherous areas such as "Rolling Corpse Mountain" and "Ghost Gate Pass" to bring films to Sifangnao Mountain Village, the masses sang praises: "Films come to the mountains, everyone smiles, if not for the Communist Party, we wouldn't even dream of it." Many model screening teams deeply loved by the masses have emerged in various provinces across the country, and the masses have bestowed upon them honorary titles such as "Night-Shining Pearl" and "Chairman Mao's Screening Team." In order to better meet the needs of the masses, many screening teams are using their ingenuity to increase the number of screenings under existing manpower and equipment conditions. Many teams regularly complete their screening plans ahead of schedule and in excess of targets.

Film screening activities in various regions resolutely implement the policy of serving politics and production. Attention is paid to selecting films with educational significance according to different audiences, providing simple and clear explanations before, during, and after screenings, introducing the film's content, significance, characters, and scenes, and making every effort to ensure that the masses can see, understand, and appreciate the films. In conjunction with the central work of the local area, various forms of propaganda, such as broadcasting, slides, exhibitions, and forums, are used to inspire the masses' enthusiasm for production and disseminate cultural and scientific knowledge. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the Yidu County screening team in Hubei Province screened the documentaries "Moving Mountains and Seas" and "The Great Leap Forward in the Countryside" for the Shanhe Brigade, which was building a canal. Based on the film content, they conducted propaganda and mobilization related to technical innovation on the construction site: "Watch films, learn from advanced experiences, learn from advanced experiences, engage in innovation, everyone creates, everyone invents, create new technologies, and complete the project early." The laborers were inspired and educated by the films, created and reformed many tools, and greatly improved production efficiency. The screening team of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in coordination with factories, launched a socialist debate on "For Whom Do We Labor," and screened films related to class education such as "Liu Jiemei" and "The White-Haired Girl," which played a positive educational and inspiring role. They also cooperated with the technical innovation movement by screening "Infinite Potential" and "The Great Starting Point," both of which had a positive effect. Recently, after the Yadi Commune screening team in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, screened "Young People in Our Village" in Xiazhuang Village, they organized a forum for students from Xiazhuang Middle School. Some students who looked down on the countryside and did not love labor were educated by the film and expressed their determination to join the canal volunteer team, engage in rural socialist construction, and change the face of their hometown.

### 深入群众为生产鼓劲  电影放映队伍遍及祖国城乡

　　深入群众为生产鼓劲
    电影放映队伍遍及祖国城乡
    新华社22日讯　适应我国广大工农兵群众不断增长的文化生活需要，一支普及文化的生力军——电影放映队伍，正在迅速发展壮大。由五万多人组成的电影放映队伍，遍及全国的城镇、工矿、农村和部队，他们终年不畏艰苦、跋山涉水把电影给工农兵群众送上门去，使边远的少数民族地区、小小的海岛和偏僻的山区都能看到电影。在今年庆祝建国十周年国产新片展览月期间，各地放映队把“林则徐”、“老兵新传”、“我们村里的年轻人”、“风暴”、“英雄战胜北大荒”、“小鲤鱼跳龙门”等最新的献礼影片以及其他优秀影片，迅速传送到祖国各地，在10月份创造了放映五十四万场、观众四亿二千万人次的空前纪录，其中农村观众达三亿多人次，使广大群众能共享普天同庆的欢乐。
    我国的电影放映网，已由解放前集中在少数城市的六百多个电影院，发展到现在将近一万五千个放映单位（部队放映队尚未统计在内），旧有的电影院已由过去为资产阶级赢利的工具，改造成为人民群众的娱乐场所，现代设备的新影院普遍建立，以工农兵群众为对象的电影放映队和电影俱乐部更从无到有大量发展起来。全国电影观众人数今年约达到四十亿多人次，比1949年增长八十五倍，其中工农观众占到80％左右。江苏省每人每年平均已能看到六次电影，内蒙的牧区、林区、工矿、城镇建立了四百多个电影放映单位。人民解放军部队90％以上的官兵每月可以看到四次电影。各地许多人民公社建立了电影放映队。
    对于我国五亿农民，电影艺术已从过去完全陌生的情况，成为迫切需要的精神食粮。各地群众热情地欢迎为工农兵服务的电影放映队。当陕西省第一个放映队冒着刺骨的寒风去到陕北偏僻山村放映时，群众敲锣打鼓、鸣放鞭炮到十几里之外来迎接他们，许多农民从几十里甚至上百里以外赶来看“毛主席的电影”。当太行山东麓河南林县的年青放映员，背着拆卸的机器零件，越过“滚尸山”、“鬼门关”等险要地带把电影送上四方脑山村时，群众歌颂道：“电影上了山，人人笑连天，不是有了共产党，做梦咱也梦不见。”全国各省涌现了许多深受群众爱戴的模范放映队，群众赠予他们“夜明珠”、“毛主席的放映队”等光荣称号。许多放映队为了更多更好地满足群众需要，在现有人力、设备条件下，开动脑筋努力增加映出场次，许多放映队都能经常提前超额完成放映计划。
    各地的电影放映活动，坚决贯彻为政治为生产服务的方针。注意根据不同对象，挑选有教育意义的影片，在映前、映间、映后进行通俗简明的解说，介绍影片的内容、意义、人物、情景等，千方百计使群众看到、看懂、看好电影，并结合当地中心工作，运用广播、幻灯、展览、座谈等多种宣传形式，鼓舞群众的生产干劲，传播文化科学知识。去年大跃进中，湖北宜都县放映队为修建渠道的山河大队放映了纪录片“移山造海”、“农村在大跃进”，并根据影片内容结合工地的技术革新进行宣传鼓动：“看电影、学先进，学先进、搞革新，人人搞创造，个个有发明，创造新技术，工程早完成。”民工们从电影上受到启发教育，创造改革了许多工具，大大提高了生产效率。北京市工会的放映队，配合工厂进行“为谁劳动”的社会主义辩论，放映了“刘介梅”、“白毛女”等有关阶级教育的影片；又配合技术革新运动放映“无穷的潜力”、“伟大的起点”，都起了积极的教育鼓舞作用。最近山西闻喜县畖底公社放映队在下庄村放映“我们村里的年轻人”之后，组织下庄中学学生举行了座谈会，有的看不起农村、不热爱劳动的学生，受到影片的教育，表示要决心参加开渠志愿队，投入农村社会主义建设，改变家乡面貌。
