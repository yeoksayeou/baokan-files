Railway workers launched a heated competition during the few days of the major transportation campaign from November 26th to December 1st, with many moving events occurring. On November 26th, in the midst of the vigorous unloading and dispatching efforts in the Luoyang area, forty-three coal cars awaiting unloading were key to the day's operations. Ji Sutian, the assistant stationmaster of Luoyang Station, and his father, Ji Jingyu (director of the Luoyang Locomotive Depot's Fuel Plant), used poetry to challenge and respond to each other in order to expedite the unloading of these coal cars. These two poems expressed the heroic spirit of the railway workers in overcoming difficulties and vigorously promoting winter transportation, as well as the competitive spirit of mutual promotion and mutual assistance. The father and son's challenge and response is also a fine story.

Son's Challenge Poem:
　　If father's a hero, son's a good man,
　　Let's compete tonight, let's see who can,
　　Unload forty-three (cars) of locomotive coal,
　　Guaranteeing they're empty before the signal's toll.
　　Sending loads, taking empties, a single game,
　　Ensuring timeliness without a second to blame;
　　Son hopes Father will accept the fight,
　　Together we'll leap forward, planting a red flag bright!

Father's Response Poem:
　　Suddenly hearing my son's battle call,
　　The old father almost laughed 'til he'd fall,
　　Singing a triumphal song, I accept the war,
　　How could I fear this little cub I bore?
　　Though old, my strength's like Huang Zhong's might,
　　Guaranteeing the unloading, guaranteeing the empty flight,
　　As long as you deliver the cars to me,
　　Forty minutes and they'll all be free;
　　After unloading, I want you to check the time,
　　Taste how spicy old ginger can be, in its prime.

    父子竞赛抢卸车
    季景鱼　季素田
    铁路职工们在11月26日到12月1日的几天运输大战中，热烈地展开了竞赛，出现了许多动人的事例。11月26日那天，洛阳地区铁路职工在大卸大排的奋战中，有四十三车待卸的机煤，是当天的关键车。洛阳车站助理站长季素田和他的父亲季景鱼（洛阳机务段燃料厂厂长），为了抢卸这批煤车，用诗歌挑战、应战。这两首诗歌表达了铁路职工们战胜困难大搞冬季运输的英雄气概，和互相促进、互相帮助的竞赛热潮。父子挑战应战，也是一段佳话。
    儿子的挑战诗父是英雄儿好汉，今晚咱们比比看，抢卸机煤四十三（车），保证排空在此关。送重取空一盘棋，分秒不差保及时；儿盼父亲来应战，双双跃进插红旗！
    父亲的应战诗忽听我儿战表下，老父差点笑掉牙，高唱凯歌把战应，岂怕你这小娃娃。年迈力壮赛黄忠，保卸机煤保排空，只要你把车送到，四十分钟全卸下；卸后要你把表看，尝尝老姜辣不辣。
