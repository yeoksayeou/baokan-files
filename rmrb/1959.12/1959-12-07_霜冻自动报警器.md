    Frost Automatic Alarm

    The Cangxian Meteorological Station in Hebei Province recently successfully trial-produced a "Frost Automatic Alarm". This alarm is equipped with an electric bell and an indicator light. Before frost arrives, the electric bell on the alarm will automatically ring, and the indicator light will also automatically light up.

    This alarm uses a specially made thermometer. Wood lubricating oil (wood lubricating oil has the same thermal expansion and contraction properties as mercury but is not conductive) is placed at the bottom of the mercury column of the thermometer. A metal wire is inserted into the mercury column. One end of the metal wire is connected to the top of the mercury column, and the other end is placed at a degree close to frost, and connected with the electric bell and indicator light, through the current. When the temperature drops and the mercury column drops to a degree close to frost, the mercury column touches the metal wire, the circuit is connected, the electric bell automatically rings, and the indicator light also lights up.

    霜冻自动报警器
    河北沧县气象站最近试制成功一种“霜冻自动报警器”。这种报警器上装有电铃和指示灯，在霜冻到来之前，报警器上的电铃就自动响起来，指示灯也就会自动发亮。
    这种报警器是用一种特制的温度计，在温度计水银柱的底部放入木溜油（木溜油具有同水银同样热涨冷缩的性质，但不导电），水银柱内插入金属丝，金属丝一端接到水银柱顶端，一端安放在接近霜冻的度数上，并与电铃、指示灯连接一起，通过电流。当温度下降，水银柱降到接近霜冻的度数的时候，水银柱与金属丝相触，电路接通，电铃就自动发出响声，指示灯也亮了。
