A typical example of a People's Air Force warrior
Xiao Hua

The movement to learn from the martyr Du Fengrui, which is being enthusiastically carried out in the Air Force, is a very meaningful event.

It has been more than a year since Du Fengrui, an outstanding young pilot from a poor peasant background, heroically sacrificed his life. However, his heroic deeds in that famous air battle where he sacrificed himself, risking his life to save his comrades, pursuing the fleeing enemy while wounded, and shooting down two enemy planes in succession; his consistent and resolute support for the Party's line and policies, actively educating relatives and the masses to never forget their roots after liberation, always listen to the Party, follow the Party, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end; his moving experience of overcoming numerous difficulties for the sake of the Party's needs, and through persistent efforts, finally mastering scientific culture and complex flying techniques from being an illiterate cowherd who didn't know a single character, all of these will forever remain in our memory and become a role model for everyone to learn from.

The only force that enabled Du Fengrui to make such brilliant contributions to the revolutionary cause in his ordinary and short life from cowherd to people's warrior was the teachings of the Chinese Communist Party, the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. From the sharp contrast between the old and new societies in his own experience, Du Fengrui deeply understood that a poor peasant child who had suffered all kinds of oppression in the old society would accomplish nothing if he left the Party, the organization, the collective, and the people. He completely achieved consciously and happily "thinking of the interests of the Party and the people in everything." He was happy to "sacrifice his own interests, even his life, for the interests of the Party and the interests of the collective."

Du Fengrui, he is a red star that shines forever in the blue skies over the Fujian front, the embodiment of the heroic image of a Chinese People's Liberation Army soldier who grew up under the guidance of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. We are saddened by the loss of such a good comrade as Du Fengrui, but we are even more proud to have such good comrades in our ranks. We have already seen that under the leadership and education of the Party, thousands of new-type people's warriors with communist style like Du Fengrui are growing up. This is the guarantee that our great cause of building and defending socialism will surely achieve final victory!

[Editor's Note] In the study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army launched a movement to learn from the martyr Du Fengrui. Taking Du Fengrui's spirit of self-sacrifice, fearless combat, and firm stance in defending the general line as the content of education, communist education was carried out to the vast number of officers and soldiers to promote an all-round leap forward in various tasks.

Martyr Du Fengrui was a Communist Party member and a wingman pilot in a certain Air Force unit. Last year, he repeatedly made battle achievements in operations against the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force on the Fujian front. In a fierce battle, in order to protect the safety of his comrades, he single-handedly rushed into the enemy ranks, bravely and stubbornly shooting down one Chiang Kai-shek plane. Then he attacked another enemy plane. At this time, an enemy plane drilled out from his right rear and fired on him, seriously damaging his plane. At this critical moment of life and death, Du Fengrui did not parachute, but insisted on controlling the wounded plane and continued to attack. Finally, he set the enemy plane on fire and it fell into the sea. At this time, Du Fengrui's plane failed. After Du Fengrui parachuted, he was shamelessly attacked by enemy planes and heroically dedicated his life to the motherland.

Du Fengrui was not only a brave and tenacious fighter, but also an excellent Communist Party member who exemplary implemented the Party's policies and lines. In the successive political movements such as land reform, unified purchase and sale of grain, agricultural cooperativization, people's communes, and the mass steelmaking campaign, he maintained a firm stance, constantly educated his family and comrades, and told them to listen to the Party, take the lead in the movements, and actively respond to all the Party's calls.

    人民空军战士的典型
    萧华
    空军部队正在热烈开展着的学习杜凤瑞烈士的运动，是一件极有意义的事。
    杜凤瑞这个贫农出身的优秀的青年飞行员，他英勇牺牲已经有一年多了。但是，他在献出自己生命的那次著名空战中，冒险救战友，负伤追逃敌，接连击落敌机两架的英雄业迹；他一贯坚决拥护党的路线政策，积极教育亲属和群众翻身不忘本，永远听党的话，跟党走，把社会主义革命进行到底的模范行为；他为了党的需要，克服重重困难，经过坚毅地努力，终于由一个放牛娃出身一字不识的文盲，掌握了科学文化，掌握了复杂的飞行技术的动人经历，这一切，永久地留在我们大家的记忆里，成为大家学习的榜样。
    使得杜凤瑞在他从放牛娃到人民战士这平凡而短短的一生中，能够对革命事业做出如此光辉的贡献的唯一力量，就是中国共产党的教导，马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的教导。杜凤瑞从亲身经历的新旧社会鲜明对比中，深刻地懂得了一个在旧社会受尽压迫的贫农孩子，如果离开党、组织、集体和人民群众，就将一事无成。他完全做到自觉而愉快地“处处为党的利益和人民的利益着想”。他乐于“为党的利益、为集体的利益，牺牲自己的利益，甚至生命”。
    杜凤瑞，他是福建前线的碧海蓝天里永远闪耀着光芒的一颗红星，是在党和毛泽东同志教导下成长起来的中国人民解放军战士英雄形象的化身，我们为失去了杜凤瑞这样一个好同志而感到难过，但我们更为我们队伍里有这样好的同志而感到自豪。我们已经看到，在党的领导和教育下，千万个像杜凤瑞一样具有共产主义风格的新型人民战士正在成长起来。这就是我们所从事的建设和保卫社会主义的伟大事业，必定获得最后胜利的保证！
                                        1959年12月1日
    〔编者附记〕中国人民解放军空军部队，在党的八届八中全会文件学习中，开展了一个向杜凤瑞烈士学习运动。以杜凤瑞的舍己为人、临危不惧的战斗精神和保卫总路线的坚定立场，作为教育内容，向广大官兵进行共产主义教育，推动各项工作全面跃进。
    杜凤瑞烈士是共产党员，空军某部僚机飞行员。去年，他在福建前线与蒋军空军的作战中屡创战功。在一次激战中，他为了掩护战友的安全，只机冲入敌群，英勇顽强地击落蒋机一架。接着他又向另一架敌机攻击。这时候从右后方钻出一架敌机向他开炮，他的飞机负了重伤。在这生死关头，杜凤瑞没有跳伞，坚持操纵负伤的飞机，继续攻击。终于把这架敌机打得冒起大火，掉到大海。这时候，杜凤瑞的飞机失灵了，杜凤瑞跳伞后遭到敌机无耻攻击，英勇地为祖国献出了自己的生命。
    杜凤瑞不仅是一个英勇顽强的战士，而且是一个模范地执行党的政策、路线的优秀共产党员。在土地改革、粮食统购统销、农业合作化、人民公社化、全民炼钢等历次政治运动中，他立场坚定，不断教育家庭和战友，要听党的话，在运动中起带头作用，积极响应党的一切号召。
