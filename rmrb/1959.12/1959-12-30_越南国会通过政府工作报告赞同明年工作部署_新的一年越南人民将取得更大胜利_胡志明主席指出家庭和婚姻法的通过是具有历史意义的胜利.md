Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 29th. The 11th session of the Vietnam National Assembly, at its plenary meeting this morning, passed the government work report and the Law on Marriage and Family.

　　The 11th session of the Vietnam National Assembly opened on the 18th. After hearing reports on the draft of the new constitution, the government work report, the report on the Law on Marriage and Family, and the report on the election law, the session moved into group discussions.

　　The resolution on the government work report adopted at today's meeting stated that the National Assembly unanimously confirmed that the Vietnamese people's work in all aspects in 1959 has seen rapid development and achieved great progress. The National Assembly also believes that since the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese people have overcome various difficulties and achieved brilliant and great victories. These achievements fully demonstrate that the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, is correct. The Party's correct line and the people's creative labor are the keys to the great achievements of North Vietnam in the cause of socialist construction.

　　The resolution praised the revolutionary enthusiasm, creative labor, and patriotic spirit of all strata of people in North Vietnam.

　　The resolution also warmly praised the spirit of struggle of the South Vietnamese people in resolutely opposing the aggressive policies of US imperialism and demanding peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　The resolution endorsed the principles put forward by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for major tasks in 1960, and believes that 1960 will be a year of greater victories for the Vietnamese people.

　　President Ho Chi Minh, Premier Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, Hoang Van Hoan, and many other National Assembly delegates spoke on the Law on Marriage and Family this morning.

　　President Ho Chi Minh said in a speech after the National Assembly passed the Law on Marriage and Family that the passage of the Law on Marriage and Family is a historically significant victory for the people of North Vietnam, especially for young people and women. The four principles of the Law on Marriage and Family are: freedom of marriage; monogamy; equality between men and women; protection of women's interests in the family and protection of children's interests.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 29th. This reporter reports: 1959 is a crucial year for the three-year (1958-1960) construction plan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In this year, the people of North Vietnam have achieved great successes in the cause of socialist construction. The various sectors of the national economy of Vietnam have continued to develop rapidly this year and have comprehensively exceeded the highest pre-war production level of 1939; North Vietnam's socialist transformation of agriculture, capitalist industry and commerce, and handicrafts has also achieved great development.

　　According to estimates from relevant departments in Vietnam, the total industrial output value of North Vietnam this year will increase by about 42% compared to last year, exceeding the highest pre-war production level of 1939 by 20%. This year, North Vietnam has newly built twenty-two factories and mines above the quota, bringing the number of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises above the quota newly built and expanded in North Vietnam in the past five years to one hundred and eight.

　　This year, the Vietnamese Labor Party continued to adopt the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and combining large, medium, and small enterprises in industrial production and construction, which greatly increased the speed of industrial development. Local industries, which only began to develop in North Vietnam last winter, have provided the state with approximately 10% of the total industrial output value this year.

　　In agriculture, North Vietnam achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of rice this year. The total rice output reached 5.2 million tons, an increase of more than 600,000 tons compared to last year. This year, the total agricultural output value of North Vietnam increased by 10% compared to last year. The output of miscellaneous grains in mountainous areas has also increased significantly compared to last year. Calculated per capita, North Vietnam harvested 66% more grain this year than in 1939.

　　The debate on the two roads of capitalism and socialism launched in the rural areas of North Vietnam this autumn has further enhanced the socialist consciousness of the peasants. Coupled with the bumper harvest in agriculture this year, it has promoted the rapid development of the agricultural cooperation movement in North Vietnam. So far, 44% of farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives. At the end of last year, there were only more than 4,900 agricultural cooperatives in North Vietnam. By the end of this year, this number has grown to more than 27,700, including more than 800 advanced cooperatives. According to estimates from relevant departments in Vietnam, North Vietnam will basically achieve agricultural cooperation by the end of next year.

　　This year, 45% of capitalist industrial and commercial households in North Vietnam have achieved joint state-private operation; 60% of handicraftsmen have joined various cooperative organizations. Production in enterprises after the implementation of joint state-private operation has generally increased by about 20%. The amount of daily necessities provided to the domestic market by a large number of handicraft cooperative organizations has greatly increased compared to last year.

　　Under the guidance of the policy of "comprehensively, vigorously, and systematically developing education" put forward by the Vietnamese Labor Party, the education cause in North Vietnam has also developed rapidly this year. At present, the plains area of North Vietnam has basically completed the task of eliminating illiteracy. The work of eliminating illiteracy in mountainous areas is being carried out vigorously.

　　Due to the large increase in the number of schools at all levels, the number of students in ordinary schools (middle and primary schools) in the entire North Vietnam has reached 1,522,213, an increase of half compared to 1958, and an increase of nearly three times compared to 1939, when the number of students was the highest during the French rule. In addition, according to incomplete statistics, by the end of September, 1.22 million people in the entire North Vietnam had participated in studies at various levels of night schools and cultural refresher courses.

　　越南国会通过政府工作报告赞同明年工作部署
    新的一年越南人民将取得更大胜利
    胡志明主席指出家庭和婚姻法的通过是具有历史意义的胜利
    新华社河内29日电　越南国会第十一次会议在今天上午举行的全体会议上，通过了政府工作报告以及家庭和婚姻法。
    越南国会第十一次会议是在18日开幕的。会议听取了关于新宪法草案的报告、政府工作报告、家庭和婚姻法的报告以及选举法的报告之后，转入了小组讨论。
    在今天的会议上通过的关于政府工作报告的决议说，国会一致确认越南人民1959年各方面的工作有了迅速的发展和取得巨大的进步。国会同时认为，和平恢复以来，越南人民已经克服种种困难，取得了辉煌的、巨大的胜利。这些成就充分证明了以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党和政府的领导是正确的。党的正确路线和人民的创造性劳动是越南北方在社会主义建设事业中取得巨大成就的关键。
    决议赞扬越南北方各阶层人民的革命热情、创造性的劳动和爱国主义精神。
    决议还热烈赞扬了南越人民坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和要求和平统一祖国的斗争精神。
    决议赞同越南民主共和国政府在1960年各项重大工作方面所提出的主张，并且认为1960年将是越南人民取得更大胜利的一年。
    胡志明主席、范文同总理、武元甲、黄文欢等许多国会代表今天上午就家庭和婚姻法发了言。
    胡志明主席在大会通过家庭和婚姻法后发言说，家庭和婚姻法的通过，对越南北方人民，尤其是对青年和妇女，是一个具有历史意义的胜利。家庭和婚姻法的四项原则是：婚姻自由；一夫一妻制；男女平等；保护妇女在家庭中的利益和保护子女的利益。
    据新华社河内29日电　本社记者报道：1959年是越南民主共和国三年（1958—1960）建设计划的关键性的一年。在这一年里，越南北方人民在社会主义建设事业中取得了巨大的成就。越南国民经济各个部门今年继续以迅速向前发展，并且全面超过了战前最高的1939年的生产水平；越南北方对农业、资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造也取得了巨大的发展。
    据越南有关部门估计，越南北方今年的工业总产值将比去年增长42％左右，超过战前生产水平最高的1939年的20％。今年，越南北方新建了二十二个限额以上的厂矿，使越南北方五年来新建和扩建的限额以上的国营工矿企业达到一百零八个。
    越南劳动党今年在工业生产和建设方面继续采取“多、快、好、省”和大中小相结合的方针，大大提高了工业发展的速度。去年冬季才在越南北方开始发展起来的地方工业，今年内已经向国家提供了占工业总产值约10％的产品。
    在农业方面，越南北方今年的稻子获得空前大丰收。稻谷总产量达到五百二十万吨。比去年增加了六十多万吨，今年，越南北方的农业总产值比去年增长了10％。山区杂粮的产量也比去年大大增加。按人口平均计算，越南北方今年收获的谷物比1939年增长了66％。
    今年秋天在越南北方农村中展开的资本主义和社会主义两条道路的辩论，进一步提高了农民的社会主义觉悟，加上今年农业的大丰收，促进了越南北方农业合作化运动的迅速发展。到目前为止，已经有44％的农户加入了农业生产合作社。去年年底，越南北方只有四千九百多个农业社，今年年底发展到二万七千七百多个，其中有八百多个高级社。据越南有关部门预计，越南北方将在明年年底以前基本实现农业合作化。
    越南北方今年有45％的资本主义工商户实现公私合营；60％的手工业者加入了各种合作组织。实现公私合营后的企业生产一般增长了20％左右。大量手工业合作组织为国内市场提供的日用品比去年大大增加。
    在越南劳动党提出的“全面、大力和有计划地发展教育事业”的方针指导下，越南北方的教育事业今年也有了迅速发展。目前，越南北方平原地区已经基本上完成了扫盲任务。山区的扫盲工作正在大力开展中。
    由于大量增办各级学校，目前，全北方普通学校（中、小学校）学生人数已经达到一百五十二万二千二百十三人，比1958年增加半倍，比法国统治时期学生人数最多的1939年增加了将近三倍。此外，据不完全统计，到9月底止，全北越有一百二十二万人参加了各级夜校和文化进修班学习。
