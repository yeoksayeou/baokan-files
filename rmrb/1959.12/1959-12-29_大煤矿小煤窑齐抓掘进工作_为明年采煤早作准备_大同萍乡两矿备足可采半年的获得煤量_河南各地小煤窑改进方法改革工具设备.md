Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 28th: After overfulfilling the annual total output value plan and the raw coal production plan thirty days and twenty-two days ahead of schedule respectively, the Datong Coal Mine is concentrating its main strength on preparing for continued leaps forward next year.

　　They are vigorously strengthening tunnel excavation work. So far, the amount of coal prepared for extraction can supply mining for more than half a year next year. Great achievements have also been made in the preparation of various equipment, materials, spare parts, and accessories. Most of the machines have been repaired. Each mine has set up worker training classes for different types of work. At Yongdingzhuang Mine, more than two thousand workers have been trained and become new skilled workers who can skillfully master operating techniques. Many mines have adopted the method of old workers mentoring new workers to train new workers in practical work. Many employees have also been sent to fraternal coal mines to learn advanced experiences.

　　Datong Coal Mine's plan for January of next year and the annual plan, as well as various guarantee measures, have been distributed to various mines, work sections, and teams, and the employees have been organized to discuss them to ensure that everyone is clear about them. Management work has also been further strengthened. The entire mine has established and improved a complete set of practical and feasible systems, including job responsibility systems, operating procedures, motor maintenance regulations, ventilation management, roof management, job-specific operations, and handover acceptance systems.

　　The entire mine has also made specific arrangements for the holiday employee rotation schedule to ensure that employees produce well and rest well.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 28th: The Pingxiang Mining Bureau has made preparations to ensure a good start to production next year.

　　As early as two months ago, the Mining Bureau began to prepare for next year's production from three aspects: tunneling, electromechanical maintenance, and material supply. After adjustments, various mines have strengthened their tunneling forces and opened up more tunneling faces. The experience of "four-eight" cross-operations and "three meters per blast" rapid tunneling has been promoted in key main roadways to accelerate the tunneling speed, ensuring that the extractable coal volume can be guaranteed until the first half of next year. In the past two months, the Mining Bureau has concentrated its main electromechanical manufacturing and repair forces and necessary materials to rush to produce a large number of equipment parts. Small and medium-sized equipment has been repaired in batches, and the maintenance of large equipment is being stepped up and can be completed before the end of the year.

　　In terms of material supply, the Mining Bureau has dispatched cadres to the places of origin of materials and the factories manufacturing equipment since September to negotiate and strive for early delivery. By the first half of December, all the equipment ordered this year had been delivered, of which 95% had been transported to the Mining Bureau and put into production.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 28th: Small coal pit workers in various parts of Henan Province are actively preparing for production, striving for continued leaps forward next year.

　　This year, the small coal pits in Henan Province have already exerted tremendous power. As of December 20th, raw coal production exceeded the national plan by 32.5%, a significant increase compared to last year. Due to the rapid development of small coal pits, the coal supply situation in the entire province has undergone fundamental changes. In 1958, the province's coal supply was not self-sufficient, but this year it is not only self-sufficient but also supports other areas.

　　Since the end of November, small coal pits throughout the province have begun to produce and prepare for continued leaps forward next year. While arranging production for the first quarter of next year, the Xuchang area, focusing on the key to continued leaps forward in small coal pits, launched a "five improvements" campaign among small coal pit workers in the entire area: improving development methods, improving coal mining methods, reforming tools and equipment, improving labor conditions, and improving ground transportation. The entire area also established a rapid tunneling advanced experience dissemination team to perform and disseminate advanced tunneling experience to various small coal pits. Small coal pits in Luoyang, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, and other areas are also actively focusing on tunneling, equipment maintenance, pit timber substitutes, and safety inspections, centering on welcoming continued leaps forward in production next year, to prepare for a good start. Small coal pit workers in Linru County recently manufactured 250 iron-wood combined soil mine cars in technical innovations, replenishing transportation equipment, and also repaired twelve kilometers of soil railways. After strengthening tunneling work, the small coal pits in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City have now prepared enough extractable coal for more than two months.

　　大煤矿小煤窑齐抓掘进工作
    为明年采煤早作准备
    大同萍乡两矿备足可采半年的获得煤量
    河南各地小煤窑改进方法改革工具设备
    新华社太原28日电　大同煤矿在分别提前三十天和二十二天超额完成全年总产值计划和原煤生产计划之后，集中主要力量为明年继续跃进作准备。
    他们大力加强巷道掘进工作，到目前止已经准备的获得煤量，可供明年开采半年以上。各种设备、器材、备品、配件的准备工作也取得很大成绩。大部分机器已经检修好了。各矿分别设立了不同工种的工人训练班，永定庄矿已经有两千多名工人经过训练，成为能够熟练地掌握操作技术的新的技术工人。不少矿井采取老工人带新工人的方法，在实际工作中培养新工人。有不少职工还被派到兄弟煤矿去学习先进经验。
    大同煤矿明年1月份的计划和全年计划以及各项保证措施，已经下达到各个矿井、工段和队组，组织职工群众讨论，使人人心里明确。管理工作也进一步加强，全矿已建立和健全了工种责任制、作业规程、电机检修规程、通风管理、顶板管理、分工种操作和交接班验收制等一整套切实可行的制度。
    全矿对节日职工轮班休息计划也已作出具体安排，保证职工生产好、休息好。
    新华社南昌28日电　萍乡矿务局已经作好保证明年生产开门红的准备工作。
    早在两个月以前，矿务局就从掘进、机电检修、器材供应三方面，着手为明年生产作准备。各矿经过调整，充实了掘进力量，增开了掘进壋头，在关键性的主要巷道中推行了“四、八”交叉作业和“一炮三米”的快速掘进经验，加快了掘进速度，使获得煤量可采期限保证到明年上半年。两个多月来，矿务局集中了主要机电制修力量和必要的材料，赶制了大批设备配件。中小型设备已经分批检修好，大型设备的检修工作正在加紧进行，年底以前可以全部检修完毕。
    器材供应方面，矿务局从9月份起就抽调了干部分头到材料产地和承制设备的工厂协商争取提前交货。到12月上半月止，今年订购的设备已全部交货，其中有95％已运到矿务局投入生产。
    新华社郑州28日电　河南省各地小煤窑职工正在积极进行生产准备，争取明年继续跃进。
    今年，河南省的小煤窑生产已经发挥了巨大威力，到12月20日止，原煤产量超过国家计划32.5％，比去年有了很大增长。由于小煤窑的迅速发展，使全省煤炭供应情况发生了根本变化。1958年这个省煤炭供应还不能自给自足，今年不但自给，还支援了外地。
    从11月下旬以来，全省小煤窑就开始边生产边为明年继续跃进作准备。许昌专区在布置明年第一季度生产的同时，针对小煤窑继续跃进的关键，在全区小煤窑职工中开展了改进开拓方式、改进采煤方法，改革工具设备、改善劳动条件、改进地面运输的“五改”运动。全区还成立一个快速掘进先进经验传播队，到各个小煤窑表演和传播先进掘进经验。洛阳、新乡、郑州等地区的小煤窑，也都以迎接明年生产继续跃进为中心，积极地抓掘进、抓设备检修、抓坑木代用品、抓安全检查，为明年开门红作准备。临汝县的小煤窑职工最近在技术革新中制造了铁木结合的土矿车二百五十辆，补足了运输设备，还修好了十二公里长的土铁路。郑州市郊区的各个小煤窑加强掘进工作以后，现在都已经准备下两个多月的获得煤量。
