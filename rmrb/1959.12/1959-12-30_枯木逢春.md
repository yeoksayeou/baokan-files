    The new play "Withered Tree Meets Spring," which the Beijing People's Art Theater will stage on New Year's Day in 1960, reflects our great victory on the schistosomiasis prevention and control front and praises the Party and Chairman Mao's deep concern for the suffering of the people.
    The play begins before liberation. Under the threat of schistosomiasis, Ku Meizi's family leaves their hometown to seek a way out. Her seriously ill father-in-law, not wanting to burden the family, drowns himself. Ku Meizi, her husband, and her mother-in-law are scattered by the reactionary army conscripting soldiers. After enduring many hardships, ten years later, the family reunites in the area where they were scattered. However, Ku Meizi is unfortunately suffering from severe schistosomiasis. Despite the deep love between the young couple, the disease prevents them from living happily together. Ku Meizi, unwilling to burden her husband, painfully hides her feelings. The mother, for the sake of her son's health, has to harden her heart and dissuade the young couple from reuniting. Fortunately, under the strong leadership of the Party, the schistosomiasis prevention and control station makes every effort to carry out prevention and control work, finally defeating the disease and saving the lives of all local schistosomiasis patients. Ku Meizi regains her health and happiness, and the family is reunited once again. The Party and Chairman Mao's care for schistosomiasis patients is like a gentle spring breeze and warm spring sunshine, causing withered trees on the verge of decay to sprout and blossom again.
    This play concentrates the pain and misfortune of millions of schistosomiasis patients and their families in the experience of Ku Meizi and her family's joys and sorrows. At the same time, through the ideological struggle within a schistosomiasis prevention and control station, it reflects the struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideology on the schistosomiasis prevention and control front. This play has rich ideological content and moving and tortuous plots.
    The playwright, Wang Lian, lived in Yujiang County, Jiangxi, and other areas where schistosomiasis was prevalent. He experienced the great joy of patients after relieving their suffering from the disease and their heartfelt gratitude to the Party. The infinitely excited mood prompted him to use the theme of schistosomiasis prevention and control to express the great theme of the Party and Chairman Mao's deep concern for the people's health.
    Xia Chun is the director of the play, and the main actors include Di Xin, Lü Qi, Wu Shukun, Yang Wei, Qin Zanyao, Zhang Fupian, Jin Zhao, and Yang Baozong. The music is composed by musicians Zhang Dinghe and Zhu Chongmao. The music better expresses the theme of the play and the atmosphere of the times, and at the same time, it is full of Jiangnan flavor, adding to the lyrical meaning of the performance.

　　“枯木逢春”
　　宁晔
    北京人民艺术剧院将要在1960年元旦上演的新戏“枯木逢春”，反映了我们在血吸虫病防治战线上的伟大胜利，歌颂了党和毛主席对人民疾苦的深切关怀。
    剧本从解放前写起。苦妹子一家人在血吸虫病的威胁之下，离乡背井，出外寻求生路。病重的公公不愿意连累一家人，投水自尽，苦妹子和丈夫、婆婆被抓壮丁的反动军队冲散。饱经沧桑，十年之后，这一家人又在被冲散的地区重新相遇了，但是苦妹子不幸患着严重的血吸虫病。尽管这一对年轻夫妻彼此深爱，但是疾病却使他们不能快乐地生活在一起。苦妹子不愿连累丈夫，忍痛隐瞒起自己的感情；母亲为了儿子的健康，也不得不硬着心肠劝阻小两口团圆。幸亏在党的有力领导下，血吸虫病防治站千方百计地开展着防治工作，终于战胜了它，挽救了当地所有血吸虫病患者的生命。苦妹子重新获得健康和幸福，一家人才重又团圆。党和毛主席对血吸虫病患者的关怀，就如和煦的春风、温暖的春阳，使行将雕谢的枯木，重新茁芽开花。
    这出戏把千百万血吸虫病人和他们家庭的痛苦不幸，集中体现在苦妹子和她一家的悲欢离合的经历里。同时通过一个血吸虫病防治站内的思想斗争，反映出在血吸虫病防治战线上无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的斗争。这个戏有丰富的思想内容和曲折动人的情节。
    剧作者王炼曾到江西余江县以及其他流行过血吸虫病的地区去生活，他体会到患者解除疾病痛苦后的巨大喜悦和对党的衷心感激。无限激动的心情促使他以防治血吸虫病这一题材，表现出党和毛主席对人民生命健康的深切关怀这个伟大主题。
    这个戏由夏淳担任导演，主要演员有狄辛、吕齐、吴淑昆、杨薇、覃赞耀、张福骈、金昭、杨宝琮等。演出由音乐家张定和、朱崇懋担任作曲。音乐较好地表现了剧本的主题和时代气氛，同时富有江南风味，增加了演出的抒情意味。（附图片）
