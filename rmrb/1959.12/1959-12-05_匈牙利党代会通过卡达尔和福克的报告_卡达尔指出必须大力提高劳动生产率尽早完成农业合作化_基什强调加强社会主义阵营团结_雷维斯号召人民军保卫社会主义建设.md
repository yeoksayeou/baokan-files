Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 4th: The Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party continued its session on the morning of the 4th.

    János Kádár, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, made a concluding speech at the morning session on the results of the Congress's discussion of the two reports made by Kádár and Fock.

    Kádár said that over the past three days, forty-seven delegates had spoken on the two reports from various aspects, very seriously, responsibly, and frankly. The delegates unanimously supported the policies implemented by the Party Central Committee over the past three years and pointed out that the new Central Committee should more bravely and firmly implement the Party's line.

    Kádár said that representatives of more than thirty fraternal parties had spoken at the Congress. They also pointed out that our Party is implementing Marxist-Leninist policies and expressed their support for us.

    Kádár said that in the process of discussing the two reports, the delegates put forward many valuable opinions. He suggested that the new Central Committee should study these issues and make specific decisions.

    Kádár pointed out that in the industrial field, special attention should be paid to vigorously improving labor productivity and improving production technology. In the agricultural field, propaganda and organizational work should be carried out better to strive to complete agricultural cooperativization nationwide as soon as possible, and to vigorously consolidate the newly established cooperatives by fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the peasant masses and strengthening leadership. At the same time, agricultural production should be rapidly increased.

    Kádár pointed out that the Party is currently strong and healthy and capable of fulfilling its historical mission.

    Kádár emphasized that the Hungarian issue should be discussed and decided by our liberated working people, our Party, Parliament, and government, and not by the United Nations.

    After listening to Kádár's concluding speech at the morning session, the delegates unanimously approved the reports of Kádár and Fock.

    The morning session also heard a report on the revision of the Party Constitution by Mátyás Marosán, member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Secretariat.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 3rd: The Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party continued its session on the afternoon of the 3rd.

    Károly Kiss, member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Committee, spoke on Hungary's foreign policy and the Party's international relations.

    Kiss pointed out that the increasingly strengthened unity and close economic ties of the socialist camp are a very important factor in the current international situation. Close ties and cooperation with the countries of the socialist camp, the selfless fraternal assistance of socialist countries, and our Party's unwavering Marxist-Leninist policy have enabled us to overcome the counter-revolutionary rebellion, rapidly consolidate politics and the economy, enable us to continue to move forward, and enable our people to prosper.

    Kiss said that since the victory over the counter-revolutionary rebellion, our country's ties with socialist countries have become more consolidated and developed. In the past three years, the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries in Europe and the Far East have been further strengthened. It is clear that the crushing of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion and the strengthening of the people's regime were a serious blow to the imperialist aggressor groups.

    Kiss pointed out that many political leaders of Western capitalist countries once hoped that the Hungarian people would abandon the path of building socialism in the 1956 counter-revolutionary rebellion. The hopes of these gentlemen have been dashed! They should understand that the Hungarian people have chosen the people's regime not temporarily, but permanently, and have embarked on the path of socialism and communism.

    Kiss said that because we have adopted a firm and unwavering policy, for some time the governments of most capitalist countries have expressed their willingness to normalize relations in one form or another. Some of them whispered, afraid that Uncle Sam would find out; others beat drums and gongs, intentionally wanting Uncle Sam to hear. Currently, the number of countries that have established diplomatic relations with our country is far greater than before the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

    Kiss said that our country's relations with the Asian and African countries that have recently been liberated from the shackles of imperialist colonialism and have embarked on the path of national independence are developing day by day, and we are happy and satisfied with this. Like the countries of the socialist camp, our country observes and supports the struggles of Asian and African countries to defend national independence and eliminate economic backwardness with sincere friendship and deep sympathy.

    In talking about the relationship between the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and fraternal parties, Kiss said that in the past three years, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has greatly strengthened its relationship with fraternal parties under the internationalist principles of the international communist movement.

    He said that the international solidarity of the communist parties greatly demonstrated its vitality after the 1956 counter-revolutionary rebellion. Representatives of many fraternal countries and fraternal parties visited our country during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Their declaration of agreement with the goals of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government was a great assistance to our Party, which was in a difficult situation at the time. The situation of our Party and our country's economic and political situation were quickly stabilized after the counter-revolutionary rebellion was quelled. This is largely due to this moral and political support, and also due to the multifaceted economic assistance provided by fraternal countries.

    Kiss emphasized that our ties with fraternal parties in various countries have become more comprehensive and active. Our ties with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have developed particularly well. These ties can be traced back decades, to the period before the Hungarian proletarian revolution of 1919. Honestly, the ties between our two parties have never been as close and deep as they are today.

    Kiss finally pointed out that the forces of the Cold War are still constantly attempting to harm humanity and prevent the easing of the international situation. These forces have repeatedly attempted to interfere in our country's internal affairs and poison the international atmosphere with worthless slanders. Therefore, we must continue to be vigilant, unite closely and inseparably with the countries of the socialist camp, and continue to implement Marxist-Leninist foreign policy to ensure lasting world peace and fully build socialism in our country.

    János Révész, member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of Defense, said in his speech that our army is now more united, stronger, and has closer ties with the masses than in the past. The political ideology, moral character, and sense of responsibility of officers have been significantly improved.

    Révész pointed out that the People's Army learned three main lessons from the 1956 counter-revolutionary incident: (1) When the enemy takes up arms against the people's regime, we must firmly take up the weapons given to us by the people and thoroughly crush the counter-revolution; (2) The People's Army should closely unite and cooperate with other armed forces in the country; (3) In order to defend socialist construction and crush the conspiracies of imperialism, it is necessary to maintain close combat cooperation with the armies of socialist countries, especially the Soviet army.

    Révész said that we fully support the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, but when the West German army, led by officers who were subordinates of Hitler, is still strengthening its armaments, and when there are still American military bases in Italy and Greece not far from us, and our motherland is still being threatened, we cannot abandon vigilance and we cannot abandon the work of strengthening the army. We will cooperate closely with the armies of socialist countries, and we are loyal to the Warsaw Pact. This treaty is a guarantee of peace and socialist construction.

    Árpád Kiss, member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Director of the National Planning Bureau, spoke about the issue of improving the level of production technology.

    He said that it is necessary to improve the utilization rate of raw materials and power, adjust the production structure, and concentrate scientific research on industrial projects that can develop industry and have the potential to reach the world's technological level. In order to develop technology well, it is necessary to train more technical cadres and improve the level of production organization and leadership. Party organizations should boldly support new initiatives and lead the masses to fight against habitual forces and complacency.

    Also speaking at the afternoon session on the 3rd were: József Nagy, Minister of Light Industry, Kálmán Karcagi, representative of Pest County, and László Nemeslaki, First Secretary of the Komárom County Party Committee, etc.

    Representatives of fraternal parties from Tunisia, Venezuela, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway, etc., addressed the afternoon session on the 3rd.

Xinhua New Agency, Budapest: István Komócsin, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committe of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Youth Union, spoke at the morning session on the 3rd about the achievements of the Hungarian CYU in youth work over the past three years and the role of youth in socialist construction. He said that the CYU should boldly publicize class struggle and revolutionary ideas to young people, and educate young people through labor and struggle. He also said that the Party must strengthen its direct leadership over the CYU.

    Also speaking at the morning session were Pálnok Putnoky, First Secretary of the Heves County Party Committee, István Plješovski, First Secretary of the Borsod County Party Committee, Ferenc Molnár, First Secretary of the Bács County Party Committee, Academician László Novobátzky, and two representatives from Budapest. In their speeches, they all expressed agreement with the reports of Kádár and Fock, and put forward many valuable opinions for improving work based on the actual situation and experience of various regions.

    匈牙利党代会通过卡达尔和福克的报告
    卡达尔指出必须大力提高劳动生产率尽早完成农业合作化
    基什强调加强社会主义阵营团结　雷维斯号召人民军保卫社会主义建设
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会4日上午继续举行会议。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔在上午会议上就大会讨论卡达尔和福克所作的两个报告的结果作了总结发言。
    卡达尔说，三天来，有四十七位代表从各方面对两个报告非常认真、负责、坦率地发了言。代表们都一致支持党中央三年来所执行的政策，并且指出了新的中央委员会应当更勇敢、更坚定地贯彻党的路线。
    卡达尔说，已有三十多个兄弟党的代表在大会上讲了话。他们也指出，我们党是执行着马克思列宁主义的政策，并且表示支持我们。
    卡达尔说，在讨论两个报告的过程中，代表们提出了很多宝贵意见。他建议新的中央委员会要针对这些问题进行研究，并作出具体决定。
    卡达尔指出，在工业方面，要特别注意大力提高劳动生产率和改进生产技术。在农业方面，要更好地开展宣传组织工作，争取尽早在全国范围内完成农业合作化，并通过充分发挥农民群众的积极性和加强领导，来大力巩固新成立的合作社。与此同时，还要迅速提高农业生产。
    卡达尔指出，目前党是强大的，健康的，能够完成它所承担的历史使命。
    卡达尔强调指出，匈牙利问题是要由我国解放了的劳动人民、我们的党、议会和政府来讨论决定的，而不是由联合国来讨论决定的。
    上午会议在听取了卡达尔的总结发言后，代表们一致通过了卡达尔和福克的报告。
    上午会议并且听取了党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记马罗山所作的关于修改党章的报告。
    新华社布达佩斯3日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会在3日下午继续举行。
    社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、中央委员会书记基什·卡罗伊就匈牙利的外交政策和党的国际联系发了言。
    基什指出，社会主义阵营日益加强的团结和紧密的经济联系，是当前国际局势中一个非常重要的因素。同社会主义阵营各国的紧密联系和合作、社会主义国家无私的兄弟般的援助以及我们党坚定不移的马克思列宁主义政策，这一切使我们能够战胜反革命暴乱，政治和经济迅速得到巩固，使我们能够继续向前迈进，使我国人民得到繁荣。
    基什说，战胜反革命暴乱以来，我国同社会主义各国的联系更加巩固和发展。在过去三年中，我国同苏联、中华人民共和国及欧洲和远东的其他人民民主国家之间的牢不可破的友谊和合作进一步加强了。很明显，匈牙利反革命暴乱被粉碎、人民政权的加强对于帝国主义侵略集团是一个严重的打击。
    基什指出，西方资本主义国家的许多政治领导人曾经指望匈牙利人民在1956年反革命暴乱中离开建设社会主义的道路，这些先生们的希望落空了！他们应该了解：匈牙利人民不是暂时地、而是永久地选择了人民政权，走上了社会主义和共产主义道路。
    基什说，由于我们采取了坚定不移的政策，一段时期来绝大部分资本主义国家政府通过这种或那种形式表示愿意使双方关系正常化。他们之中有的只是低声轻语，害怕美国叔叔知道；有的则敲锣打鼓，有意要让美国叔叔听见。目前，同我国建立外交关系的国家已经大大超过反革命暴乱以前。
    基什说，我国同那些不久刚从帝国主义殖民主义枷锁下解放出来、走上了民族独立道路的亚非国家的关系，正在日益发展，我们为此感到高兴和满意。我国同社会主义阵营各国一样，怀着真诚友好和深切同情的心情注视并支持亚非国家为保卫民族独立和消灭经济落后状态所进行的斗争。
    在谈到匈牙利社会主义工人党和各兄弟党之间的关系时，基什说，三年来，匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会在国际共产主义运动的国际主义原则下，大大加强了同各兄弟党之间的关系。
    他说，1956年反革命暴乱后，共产党的国际团结大大显示了它的生命力。许多兄弟国家、兄弟党的代表在镇压反革命暴乱期间来我国访问，他们声明同意匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的目标，这一点对当时处在困难情况中的我们党来说是一个巨大的援助。我们党的处境以及我国经济政治局势，在平定反革命叛乱后很快就得到了稳定。这在很大程度上应归功于这种道义上的和政治上的支持，也应归功于各兄弟国家给予我们的多方面的经济援助。
    基什强调说，我们同各国兄弟党的联系更加全面、更加活跃了。我们同苏联共产党之间的联系发展得特别好，这种联系可以追溯到几十年前，追溯到1919年匈牙利无产阶级革命以前的时期。老实说，我们两党之间的联系从来没有像今天这样紧密深厚。
    基什最后指出，冷战势力还在不断企图为害人类，阻止国际局势的缓和，这些势力一次又一次地试图干涉我国的内政，用一钱不值的污蔑来毒化国际气氛。因此，我们要继续提高警惕，和社会主义阵营各国紧密地、牢不可破地团结在一起，继续执行马克思列宁主义的外交政策，以保证世界的持久和平，并在我国完全建成社会主义。
    社会主义工人党中央委员、国防部长雷维斯在会上发言时说，现在我们的军队比过去更加团结、更加强大了，同群众的联系也更加密切了。军官的政治思想、道德品质和责任感有了显著的提高。
    雷维斯指出，人民军通过1956年反革命事件，吸取了三个主要的教训：（1）当敌人拿起武器反对人民政权时，我们必须坚定地拿起人民给我们的武器，彻底粉碎反革命；（2）人民军应当同国内其他武装力量紧密团结和合作；（3）为了保卫社会主义建设和粉碎帝国主义的阴谋，必须同社会主义各国的军队，特别是苏联军队保持紧密的战斗合作。
    雷维斯说，我们完全支持苏联提出的全面、彻底裁军的建议，但是当为希特勒部下的军官所率领的西德军队还在加强军备，当离我们不远的意大利和希腊还设有美国的军事基地，我们的祖国还在被威胁着的时候，我们不能放弃警惕性，不能放弃加强军队的工作。我们将同社会主义各国的军队亲密合作，我们忠于华沙条约。这个条约是和平和社会主义建设的保障。
    社会主义工人党中央委员、国家计划局局长基什·阿帕德在发言中谈到提高生产技术水平的问题。
    他说，必须提高原材料和动力的利用率，调整生产结构，科学研究要集中在能使工业得到发展并有可能达到世界技术水平的工业项目上。为了很好地发展技术，必须培养更多的技术干部，提高生产组织和领导的水平。党组织应大胆支持新的倡议，领导群众同习惯势力和安逸思想作斗争。
    在3日下午会议上发言的还有：轻工业部部长纳吉·约瑟夫、佩斯州代表卡尔凯兹和科马罗姆州党委会第一书记内梅什拉基等。
    在3日下午会议上致词的有突尼斯、委内瑞拉、荷兰、加拿大、瑞士、瑞典和挪威等国的兄弟党的代表。
    据新华社布达佩斯电　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局候补委员、匈牙利共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记科莫钦在3日上午会议上的发言中谈到了匈牙利共青团过去三年来，在青年工作方面所获得的成就以及青年在社会主义建设中的作用。他说，共青团应当大胆地向青年宣传阶级斗争和革命思想，要通过劳动和斗争来教育青年。他还说，必须加强党对共青团的直接领导。
    在上午会议上发言的还有赫维斯州党委会第一书记普特诺基，包尔绍德州党委会第一书记普利耶索尔，巴奇州党委会第一书记莫尔纳尔，科学院院士诺沃巴茨基，以及布达佩斯市的两名代表。他们在发言中都表示同意卡达尔和福克的报告，并根据各地的实际情况和经验，提出了改进工作的很多宝贵的意见。
