    This newspaper reports that Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, known for its thin soil, rocky ground, and frequent droughts, has achieved an unprecedented agricultural bumper harvest this year by overcoming a century-long drought and multiple wind, hail, and insect disasters. It has reached the national agricultural development program's target of 400 jin per mu of grain eight years ahead of schedule.
    This year, Pingshun County's grain crop area is over 202,000 mu, with a total output of over 81 million jin, an average yield of 402.5 jin per mu, an increase of 27% compared to 1958. Among them, autumn fields cover over 146,000 mu, with a total output of over 72.85 million jin, an average yield of 498 jin per mu, an increase of 30% compared to 1958. The county's total agricultural income increased by more than 50% compared to last year; the total output value of forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production increased by 150% compared to last year.
    This year's disasters were extremely severe. Although arduous disaster relief and rescue work was carried out, over 13,000 mu of major autumn crops in the county still suffered severe losses. Some communes and management districts experienced reduced production due to the disasters. Some communes, after launching a rescue campaign of "replenishing lost autumn crops with late autumn crops, replenishing lost grain fields with vegetable plots, replenishing lost dry land with paddy fields, and replenishing lost agriculture with sideline occupations," transformed severe disasters into minor disasters, basically maintaining last year's output.
    This year, Pingshun County experienced frequent disasters. In the summer, during the earing period of autumn crops, it suffered a continuous 72-day major drought starting from the beginning of the first ten-day period of summer, which was even longer than the major drought that occurred in the third year of the Guangxu reign in history. The corn leaves were withered and dry, and could be lit with a match, and the corn tassels also generally experienced the phenomenon of "rusting" (failing to ear). Since May, there have also been seven hailstorms and eight relatively severe insect plagues, and the severity of these disasters was also unprecedented. Three strong winds during the wheat harvest, the peak growing season of autumn crops, and the autumn harvest caused great difficulties for normal crop growth and careful harvesting. However, the collective strength of the people's communes is great, and they have overcome disasters time and time again, turning major disasters into minor disasters and severe disasters into light disasters.
    This year's drought occurred during the earing stage of crops, which is locally called a "strangling" drought. When the drought began to appear, the Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China fully utilized the strength of the large collective of the commune and launched a 100-day anti-drought battle throughout the county. Various communes adopted the method of watering and fertilizing by carrying water and spot watering to protect seedlings, achieving both watering and fertilization in one fell swoop. Under the encouragement of the slogan "protecting seedlings is like protecting life," some communes carried water from ten miles away, and many commune members' shoulders were swollen, but they were unwilling to rest. In the struggle against the disaster, the cooperation between communes and management districts was very good. The two communes of Shicheng and Beidanche cooperated and concentrated labor and waterwheels to divert the Zhang River water to the high mountains, irrigating more than 10,000 mu of dry land. The Doukou Management District of Shicheng Commune also used the method of suspending pipes with ropes to transport water in the air, diverting water from the South Mountain to the North Mountain for irrigation. After a day and night assault by 50,000 anti-drought troops throughout the county, fully utilizing all machinery and water sources, the drought-stricken crops throughout the county were generally spot-watered or furrow-irrigated once during the major drought.
    In order to ensure that crops would catch up after suffering from the late drought, each commune put forward the slogan "the more drought, the more processing," so that autumn fields were generally shallow-cultivated more than four times, an increase of one time compared to previous years; an average of seven to ten dan of topdressing fertilizer was applied per mu more than before. This not only greatly increased the drought resistance of crops, but also created conditions for normal crop development. In particular, after the Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed measures to give full play to the benefits of floods, the people's communes throughout the county launched a "million water channels" campaign, making it possible to build flood diversion channels everywhere and flood diversion ditches in every plot, greatly benefiting from floodwater. On August 19, it began to rain throughout the county. When it rained, all the men, women, old, and young people in the county mobilized, braving the rain to divert and block water, so that the rainwater irrigated 150,000 mu of cultivated land, and the crops basically escaped the threat of drought.
    The persistent implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture by the communes throughout the county played a significant role in fighting disasters and achieving high yields. Last year, the communes cooperated extensively to increase the depth of cultivated land from three or four inches in the past to more than five inches. More than 50,000 mu of land were deeply ploughed to seven inches to one foot, increasing the soil's ability to retain water and allowing crops to take root deeply. This year, the amount of sowing was generally 20%-30% more than in the past, achieving reasonable close planting. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu of cultivated land throughout the year generally reached 160 dan, an increase of 60 dan compared to the past. In particular, the launch of the "Red, Diligent, and Clever" labor competition throughout the county resulted in an unprecedented increase in labor efficiency. The total number of labor days throughout the county increased by 47% compared to last year, so the number of labor days invested per mu of cultivated land increased from an average of more than 20 to 30.

### 平顺县战胜百年大旱和七次雹灾八次虫害  提前八年实现农业纲要粮食指标  一万多亩秋田损失严重农业收入仍比去年增五成

    平顺县战胜百年大旱和七次雹灾八次虫害
    提前八年实现农业纲要粮食指标
    一万多亩秋田损失严重农业收入仍比去年增五成
    本报讯　以石厚土薄、十年九旱著称的低产区——山西平顺县，今年战胜百年大旱和多次风、雹、虫灾，获得了空前的农业大丰收，提前八年达到了全国农业发展纲要中粮食亩产四百斤的指标。
    平顺县今年粮食作物面积二十万二千多亩，总产量八千一百多万斤，亩平均产量为四百零二斤五两，比1958年提高了27％。其中秋田十四万六千多亩，总产七千二百八十五万多斤，平均亩产四百九十八斤，比1958年提高30％。全县农业总收入比去年增长五成多；林、牧、副总产值比去年增长了一倍半。
    今年的灾害十分严重，虽然经过了艰苦的抗灾抢救工作，全县仍有一万三千多亩大秋作物损失严重。有一部分公社管理区因灾减产；有部分公社经过开展“大秋丢了晚秋补，粮田丢了菜地补，旱地丢了水地补，农业丢了副业补”抢救运动，使重灾化为轻灾，基本保持了去年的产量。
    今年，平顺县灾害频繁。夏季正当秋作物绣穗期间，从初伏开始，连续遭受了七十二天的大旱灾，比历史上光绪三年发生的大旱灾时间还长。玉米叶子都干枯了，用火柴能够燃着，玉米脑缨也普遍发生了“堆锈”现象（绣不出穗）。从5月开始，先后又发生七次雹灾和八次较严重的虫害，这些灾害的危害程度也是空前的。在麦收和秋作物生长盛期和秋收中曾刮三次大风，这都为作物正常生长和细打细收造成了很大困难。但是人民公社的集体力量大，一次又一次地战胜灾害，使大灾变小灾，重灾变轻灾。
    今年的旱灾发生在作物绣穗阶段，当地称作“卡脖子”旱。当旱灾露头的时候，中共平顺县委充分利用公社大集体的力量，在全县掀起了百日抗旱大战。各个公社在保苗中采取了水掺肥担水点浇的办法，既浇水又施肥，一举两得。在“保苗如保命”的口号鼓舞下，有的公社到十里以外去担水，许多社员肩膀压肿了，都不肯休息。在抗灾斗争中，公社、管理区之间的协作搞得很好。石城与北耽车两个公社协同作战，集中劳力、水车，把漳河水引到高山，使一万多亩旱田得到了灌溉。石城公社竇口管理区还用绳索吊管的办法，空中运水，把南山的水调到北山灌溉。经过全县五万抗旱大军昼夜突击，充分利用一切机具、水源，使全县受旱作物在大旱之际普遍点浇或沟灌一次。
    为了保证作物在受旱后期迎头赶上来，各公社提出“越旱越要加工”的口号，使秋田普遍浅锄四次以上，比往年增加一次；平均每亩地多施追肥七至十担。这样不仅大大增加了农作物耐旱能力，同时更为作物正常发育创造了条件。特别是中共平顺县委提出充分发挥洪水效益的措施后，各人民公社在抗旱保苗的同时，又掀起了“百万条水渠”运动，作到了地地修引洪渠、块块有引洪沟，大收洪水之利。8月19日全县开始降雨，降雨时，全县男女老少齐动员，冒着雨拨水挡水，使雨水灌溉了十五万亩耕地，作物基本上摆脱了干旱的威胁。
    全县各公社坚持不懈地执行农业八字宪法，对抗灾丰产起了很大作用。去年各公社大协作，耕地深度由以往三、四寸提高到五寸以上，有五万多亩地深耕七寸到一尺，使土壤增加含水能力，作物扎根深。今年播种量一般比过去多20％—30％，作到了合理密植。每亩耕地全年施肥量普遍达到了一百六十担，比过去增加了六十担。特别是全县开展“红、勤、巧”劳动竞赛，劳动效率空前提高，全县总劳动工数比去年提高47％，因而每亩耕地的投工数由平均二十多个增加到三十个。
