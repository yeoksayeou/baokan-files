    Camel Carts of the Hexi Corridor
    If you are from out of town and set foot in the Hexi Corridor, you will be drawn to the various camel carts. Whether on the streets of towns or on the highways of the wilderness, it travels alongside cars, horse-drawn carts, and ox carts, undertaking busy transportation tasks. Currently, there are 1,004 camel carts engaged in short-distance transportation here, with a total tonnage of over 1,800 tons, equivalent to the transportation capacity of 450 cars.
    The camel, always called the "ship of the desert," was once the main means of transportation in the Hexi area. A camel can carry 300 jin of goods and travel 60 li per day. Every year in autumn, winter, and spring, groups of camel caravans travel to Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other places to carry goods. After liberation, as trains ran directly through the Hexi Corridor and cars became accessible in all directions, the role of camels greatly diminished. In 1956, employees of the Jiuquan Tire Cart Cooperative first attempted to have camels pull carts. In 1958, with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the task of short-distance transportation increased, and camel carts were greatly developed. Camels have enormous pulling power. In Zhangye and Jiuquan, four camels are used to pull a four-wheeled cart with a trailer, carrying 8 to 9.5 tons, increasing transportation efficiency by more than ten times compared to carrying on their backs. When Wuwei rushed to transport grain this year, eight camels were used to pull seven four-wheeled carts, carrying 47 tons, approximately equal to the transportation capacity of twelve cars. Changing camels from carrying goods on their backs to pulling carts also saves time in loading and unloading.
    There are now more than 26,000 strong camels in the Hexi Corridor, three times more than in the early post-liberation period. Zhangye Prefecture plans to gradually shift 60% of the camels to pulling carts. Camels will play a greater role on the transportation front. (Guo Xing, Cheng Lu, Wen Ru) (Attached photo)

    河西走廊的骆驼车
    如果你是外地人，踏进河西走廊，就会被那各式各样的骆驼车把注意力吸引住。不管是在城镇的街道上，还是在旷野的公路上，它同汽车、马车、牛车一同往来，担负着繁忙的运输任务。目前，这里参加短途运输的各种骆驼车已达一千零四辆，总吨位达一千八百余吨，相当于四百五十辆汽车的运力。
    一向被称为“沙漠之舟”的骆驼，曾是河西一带主要的运输工具。一峰骆驼可以驮载三百斤货物，日行六十华里。每年秋、冬、春三季，成群的骆驼队，运行至新疆、内蒙古等地驮运货物。解放后，随着火车直穿河西走廊，汽车四通八达，骆驼的作用大大缩小了。1956年，酒泉胶车社的职工首先作了骆驼拉车的尝试。1958年工农业生产大跃进，短途运输任务加重，骆驼车就大量发展起来了。骆驼有着巨大的牵引能力。张掖、酒泉两地，用四峰骆驼牵引一辆四轮车挂拖斗，载重八吨到九吨半，运输效率比驮运提高十几倍。武威今年突击运粮时，还用八峰骆驼牵引了七辆四轮车，载重四十七吨，约等于十二辆汽车的运力。骆驼由驮运改为拉车，装卸起来也省时间。
    河西走廊现有壮骆驼两万六千多峰，比解放初期增长了三倍。张掖专区计划逐步将60％的骆驼转向拉车。骆驼将在运输战线上发挥更大的作用。（国兴、承禄、文如）（附图片）
