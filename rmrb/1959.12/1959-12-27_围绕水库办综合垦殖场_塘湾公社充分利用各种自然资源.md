Running a Comprehensive Reclamation Farm Around the Reservoir
Tangwan Commune Makes Full Use of Various Natural Resources

(Our report) Tangwan Commune in Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved great success in running a comprehensive reclamation farm based on the reservoir.

Last winter, Tangwan Commune built a reservoir that irrigates more than 3,000 mu of farmland. The banks above the reservoir's flood storage level are barren mountains covering more than 5,000 mu, and in front of the reservoir is a barren land of more than 1,000 mu. The reservoir can be used for raising fish and ducks, the barren mountains can be afforested, and the barren land can be planted with crops and forage grass, which are favorable conditions for developing diversified operations. Now, the farm has seventy-eight people; production projects include agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, as well as processing industries; the cultivated area is more than 3,000 mu.

The comprehensive reclamation farm has shown its great role in less than a year. The members have summarized it with four major benefits: First, it has strengthened the economic power of the commune. The farm's net income this year reached 30,000 yuan, which is equivalent to 6% of the commune's collective economic income this year. This makes it easier for the commune to help poor teams catch up with rich teams and to encourage and educate members to love the commune. Second, it has developed and utilized natural resources. In the past, this was a barren mountain and wasteland. After the reclamation farm was built, more than 10,000 fruit trees, tung trees and other economic forests have been planted on the barren mountains; more than 100 mu of barren land have been reclaimed, and water from the reservoir has been used for irrigation, planting wheat, rapeseed, and feed crops; a pig farm has been established next to the feed land, raising more than 50 pigs; more than 30,000 fish and 200,000 fish fry have been raised in the reservoir; more than 3,000 ducks have been raised; and a power station has been established using the reservoir channel. A small industrial group has been built around the power station: oil pressing plant, rice mill, feed processing plant, and paper mill, which not only solve the processing of grain and feed in the farm, but also process agricultural and sideline products for the commune and the state. Third, it has expanded commodity production and become a commodity production base for the commune. This year, the reclamation farm has sold a large number of fresh fish, ducks, duck eggs, and grain to the state. Fourth, it has established an experimental garden for the commune to lead production throughout the commune. The advanced production experiences and advanced tools that the commune wants to promote throughout the commune are first tested on the reclamation farm.

The establishment of the Tangwan Commune's comprehensive reclamation farm is a victorious result of liberating the mind and daring to speak and act. When the commune proposed the plan to build the farm this spring, a few people opposed it, saying, "We can't run a commune-run reclamation farm." "Without experience and without funds and equipment, building a reclamation farm is just wishful thinking." In response to this idea, the commune party committee organized cadres and members of the whole commune to conduct a debate. After unifying the ideological understanding through debate, the commune party committee mobilized the masses to build the farm. First, it organized members and students to use their spare time to quarry rocks to make the foundation and to cut wood to make the roof beams. Within half a month, three farmhouses were built. At the same time, carpenters and ironworkers were mobilized to rush to make various production tools such as hoes, plows, and harrows for the reclamation farm. Under the principle of equal exchange, fish fry, breeding ducks, and breeding pigs were transferred from major teams. A small amount of funds was used to purchase a batch of machines needed by small factories that the commune could not manufacture from other places. As a result, the reclamation farm was built in less than a month.

After the establishment of the Tangwan Commune's comprehensive reclamation farm, in the development of production, it carried out the principle of adhering to the state plan and not competing with the production teams for profits, and implemented the policy of developing diversified operations according to local conditions. For example, the reservoirs, barren mountains, and grasslands operated by the reclamation farm are all owned by the commune or are beyond the capacity of the production teams to operate. In addition, in expanding production projects, according to the needs of the national market and resource conditions, it has developed fishery, animal husbandry, and agricultural and sideline product processing industries, and expanded commodity production.

　　围绕水库办综合垦殖场
    塘湾公社充分利用各种自然资源
    本报讯　江西贵溪县塘湾公社以水库为基地，兴办综合性垦殖场获得很大成绩。
    塘湾公社去冬兴建了一座灌溉三千多亩农田的水库。这座水库的蓄洪水位以上沿岸是面积达五千多亩的荒山，水库前面是一块一千多亩的荒地。水库可用来养鱼放鸭，荒山可造林，荒地可播种农作物和畜草，这是开展多种经营的有利条件。现在，全场有七十八人；生产项目包括农、林、牧、副、渔多种生产和加工工业；垦殖面积三千多亩。
    综合垦殖场建立不到一年，已显示了它的巨大作用。社员们总结它有四大好处：一、壮大了公社经济力量。垦殖场今年的纯收入达到三万元，这个数目相当于今年全社社有经济收入的6％。便于公社帮助穷队赶上富队和鼓舞、教育社员热爱公社。二、开发与利用了自然资源。这里过去一片荒山荒地，建起垦殖场之后，荒山上已栽植了一万多株果树、桐子树等经济林；一百多亩荒地已经垦复，引用水库蓄水进行灌溉，播种了小麦、油菜和饲料作物；在饲料地旁建立了一个养猪场，养猪五十多头；利用水库放养了三万尾鱼和二十万尾鱼苗，三千多只鸭；利用水库渠道建立一个动力站，以动力站为中心建起了一个小型工业群：榨油厂、碾米厂、饲料加工厂和造纸厂，除解决了场内粮食和饲料加工外，还为公社、国家加工了农副产品。三、扩大了商品生产，成为公社的商品生产基地。垦殖场今年已向国家出售了大批鲜鱼、鸭、鸭蛋和粮食。四、为公社领导全社生产建立了试验园地。公社要向全社推广的各项先进生产经验、先进工具，都先在垦殖场进行试验。
    塘湾公社综合垦殖场的建立，是解放思想、敢说敢干的胜利成果。公社今春提出办场计划时，少数人提出反对，他们说什么“不能搞社办垦殖场。”“既无经验，又无资金器材，要办垦殖场，真是异想天开。”公社党委针对这种思想，组织全社干部、社员开展了辩论。通过辩论统一了思想认识后，公社党委发动群众建场。首先，组织社员、学生利用业余时间开山取石做屋基，伐木做屋梁，半月之内就盖起了三栋场房。同时又发动木工、铁工为垦殖场赶制了锄、犁、耙等各种生产工具。在等价交换的原则下，从各大队调来了鱼苗、种鸭、种猪。以少量的资金，从外地购进了一批本社不能制造的小型工厂需要的机器。结果，不到一个月，垦殖场就建成了。
    塘湾公社综合垦殖场建起后，在发展生产中开展了坚持服从国家计划和不与生产大队争利的原则，贯彻了因地制宜发展多种经营的方针。例如，垦殖场经营的水库、荒山、草地，全部都是社有的或是生产大队无力经营的。又如，在扩大生产项目中，根据国家市场需要和资源情况，发展了渔业、畜牧业和农副产品加工工业，扩大了商品生产。
