Xinhua News Agency, 3rd December: Singapore News: The Singapore ruling party, People's Action Party's, organ "Action Weekly" published on November 28th pointed out in an article that the recent anti-Chinese incidents in Indonesia and other places were obviously encouraged by some forces behind the scenes.

The article criticized the provocative remarks made by some international figures recently on the issue of overseas Chinese. It said that their intention in doing so is very clear, and any ruling authority that mishandles these issues is likely to cause tragedy.

The article pointed out that many emerging countries in Southeast Asia inevitably have overseas Chinese residents. They have always lived in harmony with other ethnic groups, and their contributions to local construction cannot be erased. Naturally, they cannot be treated as outsiders.

The article said that the anti-Chinese incidents currently occurring in Indonesia and other places may be unfortunate events caused by some narrow-minded nationalists. It believes that the overseas Chinese issue can only be resolved according to correct principles, so as not to fall for the schemes of political brokers who sow discord.

    新华社3日讯　新加坡消息：11月28日出版的新加坡执政党人民行动党机关刊“行动周刊”在一篇文章中指出，最近在印度尼西亚等地发生的排华事件，显然是受到某种势力在背后鼓励。
    文章指责国际上一些人士最近在华侨问题上发表的挑拨性言论。它说，他们这样做的用意是很明显的，任何执政当局如果对这些问题处理不善，便很可能造成悲剧。
    文章指出，在东南亚许多新兴国家中都不免有华侨居住，他们同其他民族一向和睦共处，他们对当地建设的贡献也不能抹煞，自然不能把他们当作外人看待。
    文章说，目前在印度尼西亚等地发生的排华事件可能是一些狭隘民族主义者造成的不幸事件。它认为，华侨问题只有依照正确的原则去解决，才不会上政治掮客挑拨离间的当。
