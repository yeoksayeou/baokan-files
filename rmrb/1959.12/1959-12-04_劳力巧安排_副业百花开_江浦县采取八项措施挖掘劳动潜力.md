(Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 3rd) Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, while vigorously developing water conservancy projects and managing overwintering crops, is making every effort to tap labor potential and engage in diversified operations in winter. From October 1st to November 26th, the county's income from diversified operations reached 2.15 million yuan, accounting for approximately 22% of the total agricultural output value, completing 67% of the total output value of winter diversified operations, with an average income of 61 yuan per household.

This year's winter production tasks in Jiangpu County are more arduous than in previous years: 180,000 mu of overwintering crops urgently need processing and management; the volume of earthwork for water conservancy is 40% higher than the same period last year; 30,000 mu of winter-idle land urgently needs plowing; and diversified operations need to be launched. However, the county only has 65,000 full and semi-laborers. Faced with this situation, some cadres and commune members developed a fear of difficulties and a lack of confidence. They said: "Winter production is so busy, and we still have to engage in diversified operations. How many hands can one person have? Where will the labor come from?" "If grain production is not done well, we will be criticized, but if sideline production is not done well, we will only be named." In order to ensure a comprehensive leap forward in winter production and a more rational arrangement and use of labor, and to use every ounce of power on the "cutting edge," the county party committee, based on the ideological situation of the cadres and the masses, conducted political and ideological work on the one hand, and fully promoted democracy on the other. From bottom to top, cadres and commune members were mobilized to arrange agricultural work, time, and labor at each level, and plans for arranging and using labor were formulated at each level. According to the arrangements and plans of various places, the county party committee immediately invested 25% to 30% of its labor force in farmland water conservancy construction; 50% of its labor force in the field management of overwintering crops centered on accumulating fertilizer and topdressing; 15% of its labor force in collective welfare; and 10% to 15% of its labor force in diversified operations. In this way, both key projects and general projects were taken care of; both regular projects and sudden projects were taken care of. Winter production is changing rapidly, and the number of diversified operations projects has rapidly increased from more than 40 to more than 100. Commune members happily said: "Skillful labor arrangement, diverse sideline occupations flourish, water is treasure, mountains are full of wealth, income is greatly increased, and life is greatly improved."

In the course of carrying out winter diversified operations, various localities have further adopted eight specific measures to rationally organize and use labor, and to tap labor potential in all aspects. The eight measures are:

(1) According to the strength of labor, the lightness of agricultural work, and the difficulty of operation, different labor forces are assigned to do different tasks, giving full play to the role of each labor force. For example, heavier agricultural work such as cutting firewood in the mountains is assigned to stronger labor forces; lighter agricultural work such as collecting wild plants is assigned to commune members with weaker physical strength; and light agricultural work such as peeling cotton stalks is mobilized for the elderly and children to do. After such arrangements were made in Shiqiao Commune, more than 1,000 auxiliary laborers, such as the elderly and children, peeled nearly 70,000 jin of cotton stalks in three evenings alone.

(2) For projects with higher technical requirements, dedicated personnel are fixed to be responsible, giving full play to the technical expertise of commune members. To develop aquatic production, each people's commune selected more than 800 commune members with experience in fishing and catching crabs to enrich the aquatic fishing team. In 47 days, they caught more than 600,000 jin of fish and crabs, three times more than the amount caught in the third quarter. Various localities also extracted 126 hunting experts, who captured more than 16,000 wild chickens, rabbits, roe deer, etc. in more than a month, exceeding the hunting achievements of any previous year.

(3) There is both professional division of labor and flexible mobilization of labor in order to promote each other and improve production capacity. Daqiao Commune organized a professional fertilizer accumulation team of more than 1,200 people and a professional wild plant collection team of more than 1,100 people. The fertilizer accumulation work can be done day and night, while the wild plant collection can only be done during the day. Therefore, the wild plant collection team draws out 80% of its labor force every night to help accumulate fertilizer, while the fertilizer accumulation team draws out a part of its labor force during the day to help collect wild plants, promoting both diversified operations and the fertilizer accumulation movement.

(4) Closely combine various agricultural tasks and carry out diversified operations. For example, combine the collection of sunflower stalks and castor beans with field management, combine catching crabs in dry rivers with fertilizer accumulation, and combine collecting wild plants with grazing cattle and sheep.

(5) According to the characteristics of diversified operations projects, seize the season and combine regular and concentrated efforts closely. Since October, it has been the season for picking wild plants, which will wither after frost. According to this characteristic, the county party committee organized six county-wide concentrated efforts, collecting more than 380,000 jin of wild plants, and also cutting back a large amount of mountain firewood, reeds, and thinned tree branches.

(6) Mobilize government cadres, employees, and students to use holidays and spare time from work and study to invest in sideline production; actively help urban residents, especially housewives, arrange household chores, squeeze out time for sideline occupations, and give play to the labor potential of urban residents.

(7) Actively rectify collective welfare undertakings and reduce non-production personnel. On the premise of running public canteens well, the county further adjusted the canteen staff, extracting more than 1,300 auxiliary laborers to invest in sideline production. At the same time, based on the principle of voluntary participation and active management, more than 600 canteens were restored and developed, and the number of nurseries also increased from more than 500 to more than 830, saving a total of more than 2,000 laborers.

(8) Mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out tool reform and carry out high-efficiency movements to free up labor and invest in diversified operations production. In the autumn sowing, water conservancy construction, and other movements, the county reformed tools for sowing, threshing, fertilizing, and water conservancy, increasing efficiency by about one time, saving more than 850 laborers to invest in diversified operations.

After Jiangpu County adopted rational arrangements and use of labor, a comprehensive leap forward situation appeared in the county's winter production. In more than a month, the income from winter diversified operations increased by one and a half times compared with the same period last year, more than 83,000 more earthworks were done in farmland water conservancy projects than in the same period last year, more than 7 million dan of fertilizer was accumulated, an increase of more than one time compared with the same period last year, and more than 90,000 mu of seedling fertilizer was topdressed, more than a month earlier than last year. In addition, the county has completed the task of plowing more than 30,000 mu of winter land.

    劳力巧安排  副业百花开
    江浦县采取八项措施挖掘劳动潜力
    本报南京3日电　江苏江浦县在大兴水利工程、管好越冬作物的同时，千方百计挖掘劳动潜力，大搞冬季多种经营。全县从10月1日至11月26日的五十七天中，多种经营收入达二百一十五万元，约占农业总产值22％左右，完成冬季多种经营总产值67％，平均每户已收入六十一元。
    江浦县今年的冬季生产任务比往年更为繁重：十八万亩越冬作物急需加工管理；水利土方比去年同期增加40％；三万亩冬闲地急待耕翻；多种经营又要上马，而全县总共只有六万五千个整半劳力。面对这种情况，曾有一部分干部和社员，产生了畏难情绪，信心不足。他们说：“冬季生产这样忙，还要搞多种经营，一个人能有几双手，劳力哪里来？”“粮食生产搞不好会受批评，副业生产搞不好顶多点点名。”等等。为了保证冬季生产全面跃进，更加合理安排和使用劳力，把每个动力用在“刀口上”，县委根据干部和群众中存在的思想情况，一面进行政治思想工作，一面充分发扬民主，自下而上层层发动干部和社员排农活、排时间、排劳力，层层订出了安排和使用劳力的规划。县委根据各地安排和规划，全县立即以25％至30％的劳力投入农田水利建设；以50％的劳力开展以积肥追肥为中心的越冬作物田间管理运动；以15％的劳力搞集体福利，以10％至15％的劳力搞多种经营。这样，既照顾了重点项目，又照顾了一般项目；既照顾了经常性的项目，又照顾了突击性的项目。冬季生产日新月异，多种经营的项目迅速由四十多种增加到一百多种。社员们高兴地说：“劳力巧安排，副业百花开，靠水皆是宝，靠山遍地财，收入大增加，生活大改善。”
    在开展冬季多种经营的活动中，各地又进一步采取八项具体措施，合理地组织和使用劳力，并从各方面挖掘劳动潜力。八项措施是：
   （1）根据劳力强弱、农活轻重、操作难易等情况，分配不同的劳力去做，充分发挥了每个劳力的作用。如上山砍柴等较重的农活分配较强的劳力去做；采集野生植物等较轻的农活，分配体力较差的社员去做；剥棉秆皮等轻便农活发动老人、小孩去做。石桥公社经过这样安排，单是一千多个老年人、儿童等辅助劳动力，三个晚上就剥棉秆皮近七万斤。
    （2）对于技术性较强的项目，都固定专人负责，充分发挥社员的技术专长。发展水产生产，各人民公社选出八百多名有捕鱼、捉蟹经验的社员，充实水产捕捞队伍，四十七天中捕捞鱼蟹就达六十多万斤，比第三季度的捕捞量增加三倍。各地还抽出打猎能手一百二十六人，一个多月捕获野鸡、野兔、獐子等一万六千多只，超过了过去任何一年的狩猎成绩。
    （3）既有专业分工，又灵活地调动劳力，以便互相促进，提高生产能力。大桥公社组织积肥专业队伍一千二百多人，采集野生植物专业队伍一千一百多人，积肥工作白天晚上都能干，采集野生植物只能白天干。因此，采集野生植物专业队每天晚上抽出80％的劳力帮助积肥，而积肥专业队白天抽出一部分劳力帮助采集野生植物，促进了多种经营和积肥运动两高涨。
    （4）紧密结合各项农活，开展多种经营活动。如搞田间管理时结合收集葵花秸、蓖麻等，积肥时结合干河捕捉螃蟹，放牛放羊时结合采集野生植物。
    （5）根据多种经营项目的特点，抓住季节，做到经常与突击紧密结合。10月以来，正是野生植物采摘的季节，这些野生植物下霜后都会枯萎。根据这个特点，县委组织六次全县性的大突击，采集野生植物三十八万多斤，还砍回大量山柴、芦苇和间伐树枝。
    （6）发动机关干部、职工、学生利用假日和工作、学习等空余时间投入副业生产；积极帮助市镇居民特别是家庭主妇安排家务，挤出时间搞副业，发挥了市镇居民劳动潜力。
    （7）积极整顿集体福利事业，紧缩非生产人员。全县在办好公共食堂的前提下，进一步调整了食堂工作人员，抽出一千三百多个辅助劳力投入副业生产。同时，根据自愿参加、积极办好的原则，恢复与发展食堂六百多个，托儿所也由原来五百多个发展到八百三十多个，共节省劳力二千多人。
    （8）发动群众大搞工具改革，开展高工效运动，腾出劳力，投入多种经营生产。全县在秋播、兴修水利等运动中，改革播种、脱粒、施肥、水利等工具，提高工效一倍左右，节省出八百五十多个劳力投入多种经营。
    江浦县采取合理安排和使用劳力以后，全县冬季生产出现了全面跃进的局面。一个多月来，冬季多种经营的收入比去年同期增加一倍半，农田水利工程比去年同期多做八万三千多土方，积造肥料七百多万担，比去年同期增长一倍以上，追施苗肥九万多亩，比去年提前一个多月。此外，全县已完成冬翻土地三万多亩的任务。
