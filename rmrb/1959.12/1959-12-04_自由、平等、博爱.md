Poetry and Painting Combination

    "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"
    Jiuquan, poetic accompaniment: The colonial master laughs heartily, calling out, "My little slave, my son! From now on, you can call me daddy. No need to worry about the shoeshine money anymore. You shine the shoes, I wear the shoes, everyone is free; you and I become one family, we are equal to each other; daddy loves son, son loves daddy, very fraternal. Old slogans, but there may be people who still believe them!" (Attached image)
      "From now on, you can call me Papa." Painting by the French artist Kaam.
