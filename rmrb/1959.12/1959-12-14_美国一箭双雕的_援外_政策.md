    The U.S.'s Two-Birds-With-One-Stone "Foreign Aid" Policy
    Zhang Zhenya
    The day after U.S. President Eisenhower left Washington for his eleven-nation "goodwill visit," the *New York Post*, in an article discussing the visit, stated: "Russia's lead in science and China's 'Great Leap Forward' in economic development have greatly damaged the prestige of democratic nations in every region of the world. One way to deal with them is to need a bold new plan, a Marshall Plan for Asia and Africa."
    This statement by the *New York Post* coincides with a recent report by Japan's Kyodo News. The news agency, in reporting on the trend of U.S. foreign "aid," stated that the recent U.S. foreign economic "aid" policy shows a "trend of focusing on major Asian and African countries with strong neutral colors, such as India and the United Arab Republic."
    Even before the U.S. President's departure for his visit, the slogan of "aiding Asian and African countries" was already being loudly promoted in Washington. President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Herter, Undersecretary of State Dillon, and politicians and economists from both the Democratic and Republican parties were all emphasizing "the importance of aiding economically underdeveloped countries to the free world" on various domestic and international occasions. The United States Information Agency boasted extensively about the details of U.S. "aid" to India. The Associated Press also specifically listed the details of the "aid" received by the ten countries Eisenhower was visiting over the past twelve years, boasting that the total had reached $21 billion, in order to exaggerate America's "generosity."
    What is the purpose of the U.S. ruling clique's vigorous promotion of "aiding Asian and African countries"? This can be clearly seen from the recent remarks of some policymakers in Washington. On November 17, U.S. Undersecretary of State Dillon, in a speech in Des Moines, openly stated that the "socio-economic revolution sweeping Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America" must be brought into the Western orbit. He also said that the most effective way to do this is to promote the U.S.'s "Mutual Security Program" (i.e., "U.S. Aid"). Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Satterthwaite, in discussing providing more "aid" and more "technical assistance" to Africa's development, also stated that the purpose of U.S. policy is to "encourage the continent to develop soundly and orderly in a manner consistent with the ideals of the free world." A U.S. Senate foreign policy expert group recently also "frankly" said: "In order to effectively participate in the revolutionary economic development process of (underdeveloped countries), we should at least use a quarter of America's annual increase in production—that is, an amount exceeding the current level of 'aid'—for this purpose in the next ten years." These statements, when exposed, are nothing more than an attempt to firmly control these countries within the orbit of the U.S. imperialist colonial system.
    However, despite these noises about "aiding underdeveloped countries," Washington is actually outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and struggling to make ends meet. Economic difficulties unprecedented since the war are causing it to face a difficult situation in peddling "U.S. Aid." In the past two years, the U.S. has experienced a staggering deficit of $7.4 billion in its foreign payments, leading to a large outflow of gold. After the U.S. federal budget had a deficit of $12.5 billion in the last fiscal year, it will have a deficit of several billion dollars in this fiscal year. At the same time, the national debt currently exceeds $290 billion, and the annual interest expense on the national debt alone is equal to the entire federal budget of 1940. In addition, under deficit financing, domestic inflation is increasing. The prices of daily necessities have risen six times in the past seven months. The price index of daily necessities in October increased by 25.5% compared to the average level of 1947-1949. At a time when domestic finances are in such a mess, the U.S. ruling authorities want to substantially increase "foreign aid" spending, which is nothing more than trying to appear fat by slapping one's face. In fact, in recent years, due to heavy domestic taxes and a general decline in people's living standards, the American people strongly oppose "foreign aid" appropriations that are useless to them. "U.S. Aid" funding has been in a "slump" state. According to a recent report by the "Draper Committee" appointed by Eisenhower, the U.S. government had $8 billion in "military aid" appropriations approved by Congress but not yet used when Eisenhower took office in 1953, but currently only $2.5 billion remains. The reason is that in recent years, under the pressure of voters, the "military aid" appropriations approved by members of Congress each year have been far lower than the U.S. government's actual annual "military aid" expenditure. "Military aid" is already in this state, and "economic aid" is even more difficult to improve.
    However, although the U.S. ruling authorities face many difficulties in expanding their "foreign aid" plan, they are not willing to give up. Currently, in addition to striving to increase "U.S. Aid" funding domestically, they are also doing everything possible to force their "allies" in Western Europe and Japan to jointly share the burden of their "foreign aid." In the words of Undersecretary of State Dillon, while the U.S. "does not relax its own efforts," Western Europe and Japan must also cooperate with the U.S. in "playing a greater role" in "aiding" Asian and African countries.
    To achieve this goal, the U.S. ruling group has launched a so-called "aid to underdeveloped countries" campaign. At the end of September this year, the 14th annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which is controlled by the United States and has 68 member countries, passed a resolution to establish an "International Development Association" to provide long-term loans to underdeveloped countries, with a planned fund of $10 billion, of which the United States would provide $330 million, and Western Europe and Japan would provide $420 million. On November 19, the Economic Committee of the North Atlantic Group Parliamentary Assembly passed a resolution calling on member states to "increase assistance to underdeveloped regions of the world." On November 22, Ross, a responsible official of the British Foreign Office, Eastwood of the Colonial Office, and Hunt of the Commonwealth Relations Office, also specifically discussed the issue of US-British cooperation in Africa with Satterthwaite, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs at the State Department in Washington. According to Western newspapers, Undersecretary of State Dillon's recent trip to Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting beginning on December 16 will both include "aid to underdeveloped countries" as an important topic for discussion.
    However, the West's conspiracy to jointly control the political and economic life of economically underdeveloped countries is not as "united" as it appears on the surface. On this issue, although they have consistent interests, the irreconcilable contradictions between them are even more obvious.
    Originally, the U.S. wanted Western European countries and Japan to share more of the "foreign aid" burden. On the one hand, the aim was to firmly put the noose of "aid" on economically underdeveloped countries so as to bring them into the Western orbit, that is, into the U.S. colonial orbit; on the other hand, it was trying to take the opportunity to control the increasing funds of Western European countries and Japan and make them available for U.S. use.
    For the past two years, Washington has long been envious of the rapid increase in the gold and foreign exchange reserves of Western European countries and Japan, and has been eager to control them, which is no secret. In 1958, the United States lost $2.3 billion in gold. However, Western European countries and Japan have greatly strengthened their reserves. Among them, Britain's gold reserves increased by $1.25 billion, the Netherlands increased by $300 million, Belgium increased by $350 million, Italy increased by $600 million... Japan's foreign exchange reserves also increased by nearly $400 million, forming a sharp contrast between the relative rise in the economic status of Western Europe and Japan and the sharp decline in the economic status of the United States. This situation has continued to develop this year. In the first half of the year, Western Europe's foreign exchange surplus increased by more than $5 billion. In order to find a way out for their surplus funds, the six Western European countries have established a "Common Market Overseas Development Fund." In addition, they are planning a joint "foreign aid" plan. According to the *Times* on November 4, Western Europe also intends to establish a new European institution to provide general export credit to economically underdeveloped countries on a multilateral basis. Obviously, Western Europe plans to start its own business in "foreign aid" and capital export, and is unwilling to be restrained by the United States. However, the United States is doing everything possible to bring their plan into the U.S. orbit. At the 14th annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank held in Washington at the end of September, U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson proposed the establishment of the "International Development Association," requiring Western Europe and Japan to provide more "aid" funds for this new institution, which was an attempt in this regard. Although this proposal was forcibly passed under U.S. pressure, according to the U.S. *Business Week* on October 10, many Western European countries and Japan had reservations about the establishment of this institution at the meeting: Britain believed that it had done its best, providing $322.2 million in "grants" and loans to underdeveloped countries in the last fiscal year, and now it no longer had the strength to provide more "aid" funds; West Germany at the time stated that it was only willing to "aid" underdeveloped countries by lending to West German exporters; France, on the other hand, citing the Algerian War as a reason, indicated that it was unable to "provide surplus funds." In this case, U.S. *Fortune* magazine pointed out: "Because other countries are unwilling to provide more funds, the International Development Association will once again become a U.S. (aid) plan that is only nominally international." This finally aroused a "strong reaction" from the U.S. decision-making authorities. From the beginning of October, a wave of vehement condemnation of Western European countries' unwillingness to share the "foreign aid" burden swept through Washington, and at the same time, it threatened that the United States "would be forced to completely revise its economic policy toward Western Europe." The implication was to restrict the import of Western European goods and reduce "aid" to Western Europe as a threat. In order to punish Western European countries and Japan for their "selfish behavior" of being unwilling to provide more "aid" funds, Washington also added "buy American" restrictions to the loan conditions of its "Development Loan Fund" and the long-term engineering loans provided by the "International Cooperation Administration" in order to implement the so-called principle of "whoever provides aid buys whose goods" in order to crack down on Western European countries and Japan from obtaining more U.S. dollar foreign exchange. However, despite this, the pressure exerted by Washington has not yet been able to make its Western European partners quickly submit.
    In this way, the U.S. ruling authorities want to use the name of "aiding underdeveloped countries" to play a "two birds with one stone" trick: both controlling economically underdeveloped countries and controlling its partners in Western Europe and Japan. However, regardless of whether Western European countries and Japan dare to continue to resist the United States and not succumb to the pressure exerted by the United States, the people of economically underdeveloped countries are increasingly able to see through the U.S.'s dollar shackles.

    美国一箭双雕的“援外”政策
    张振亚
    美国总统艾森豪威尔离开华盛顿作他的十一国“亲善访问”的第二天，“纽约邮报”在一篇谈论这次访问的文章中说：“俄国在科学方面走在西方的前面以及中国在经济发展方面的‘大跃进’，大大损害了民主国家在世界每个地区的威信。对付它们的一个方法就是需要一个大胆的新计划，一个亚洲和非洲的马歇尔计划”。
    “纽约邮报”的这一说法同日本共同社最近的一则报道不谋而合。这家通讯社在报道美国对外“援助”的趋势时说，最近美国对外经济“援助”政策表现出一种“要把重点放在中立色彩浓厚的印度、阿联等亚非主要国家方面的动向”。
    还在美国总统出国访问以前，“援助亚非国家”的口号在华盛顿就已高唱入云。总统艾森豪威尔、国务卿赫脱、副国务卿狄龙、民主党和共和党的政客、经济学者在各种国内和国际场合，都在强调“援助经济不发达国家对自由世界的重要”。美国新闻处大事吹嘘了美国对印度“援助”的详细情形。美联社还特别列举了艾森豪威尔所周游的十个国家十二年来从美国接到的“援助”的细账，吹嘘总数已达到了二百一十亿美元，以夸耀美国的“慷慨”。
    美国统治集团这样大事吹嘘“援助亚非国家”的目的何在呢？这从华盛顿一些决策人士最近的言论中就可以看得明白。11月17日美国副国务卿狄龙在美国得梅因的一次演说中毫不隐讳地说：必须把“席卷亚洲、非洲、中东和拉丁美洲的社会经济革命”纳入西方轨道，他并且说，在这方面最有效的办法就是推行美国的“共同安全计划”（即“美援”）。国务院负责非洲事务助理国务卿萨脱斯威特在谈到给非洲的发展以更多的“援款”和更多的“技术援助”时也表示：美国政策的目的就是要“鼓励这个大陆以符合于自由世界的理想的方法健全地有秩序地发展”。美国参院的一个外交政策专家小组最近也“坦率”地说：“为了有效地参预（不发达地区国家）革命性的经济发展进程，我们至少应该在今后十年间把美国每年增产所得的四分之一——即超过目前‘援助’水平的数目——用于这一目的”。这些说法，拆穿了只不过是硬要把这些国家牢牢地控制在美帝国主义殖民体系的轨道之内罢了。
    不过，尽管有这些“援助不发达国家”的喧嚷，华盛顿实际上却是外强中干，捉襟见肘。战后所从未有过的经济困难，正在使它在兜销“美援”方面出现寸步难行的局面。两年来，美国在对外支付中已出现七十四亿美元的惊人逆差，导致了大量的黄金外流。美国联邦预算在上一财政年度出现一百二十五亿美元赤字以后，本财政年度又要出现好几亿美元的赤字。同时，国债目前已超过二千九百亿美元，仅国债年利开支已等于1940年的整个联邦预算。另外，在赤字财政下，国内通货膨胀正在有增无已。日用品价格近七个月中已上涨了六次。10月份日用生活品价格指数比1947年—1949年平均水平增加了25.5％。在国内财政如此焦头烂额的时候，美国统治当局想再大量增加“援外”开支，不过是打肿了脸充胖子，实际上，几年来由于国内税收苛重，人民生活普遍下降，美国人民强烈反对对他们一无用处的“援外”拨款，“美援”经费一直处于“不景气”状态。据艾森豪威尔任命的“德莱柏委员会”最近的报道，美国政府手中拥有的经国会批准而尚未动用的“军事援助”拨款在1953年艾森豪威尔上台时尚存有八十亿美元，目前已仅余二十五亿美元。原因就是几年来国会议员在选民压力下每年通过的“军事援助”拨款，大大低于美国政府每年的实际“军事援助”支出。“军事援助”尚且如此，“经济援助”就更难有起色了。
    不过美国统治当局在扩大它的“对外援助”计划方面虽然困难重重，但它并不肯因此死心。目前它除了在国内力求增加“美援”经费之外，还千方百计地强使它的“盟国”西欧和日本共同分担它的“援外”负担。用副国务卿狄龙的话来说就是，在美国“不放松自己的努力”的同时，西欧和日本也要配合美国在“援助”亚非国家方面“发挥更大的作用”。
    为了达到这个目的，美国统治集团开始了一个所谓“援助不发达国家”的运动。今年9月底，为美国控制的拥有六十八个成员国的国际货币基金组织和世界银行第十四届年会已通过决议，成立了对不发达国家提供长期贷款的“国际开发协会”，基金预定十亿美元，美国提供三亿三千万美元，西欧和日本提供四亿二千万美元。11月19日北大西洋集团议员会议经济委员会通过了要会员国“增加对世界不发达地区的帮助”的决议。11月22日英国外交部的负责官员罗斯、殖民地部的伊斯特伍德和联邦关系部的亨特，在华盛顿还特别同国务院非洲事务助理国务卿萨脱斯威特讨论了美英在非洲合作的问题。据西方报刊透露，最近美国副国务卿狄龙的前往欧洲以及12月16日开始的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议，都将把“援助不发达国家”作为它们讨论的重要议题。
    但是西方在阴谋共同控制经济不发达国家的政治和经济生活中，并不像表面所显示的那样“团结无间”。在这个问题上，它们虽然有着一致的利害关系，但是更明显的是它们之间存在着无法协调的矛盾。
    原来美国要西欧国家和日本更多分担“援外”负担，其目的一方面是要给经济不发达国家牢牢套上“援助”的套索，以便把它们纳入西方轨道，也就是纳入美国的殖民轨道；另一方面则是图谋乘机控制西欧国家和日本正在增加着的资金，使之为美国所利用。
    两年来，华盛顿对西欧国家和日本黄金和外汇储备的迅速增加，早就看得眼红而亟欲加以控制，这并不是什么秘密。1958年美国损失黄金二十三亿美元。但西欧国家和日本却大大加强了它们的储备。其中英国黄金储备增加了十二亿五千万美元，荷兰增加了三亿美元，比利时增加了三亿五千万美元，意大利增加了六亿美元……日本的外汇储备也增加了近四亿美元，形成了西欧和日本经济地位相对上升，美国经济地位急骤下降的尖锐对比。今年以来，这一情况继续在发展。上半年，西欧外汇结余又增加了五十多亿美元。为了给自己的多余资金找出路，西欧六国已建立了“共同市场海外开发基金组织”。另外，它们正在筹划一项联合“援外”计划。据11月4日的“泰晤士报”透露，西欧还打算建立一个新的欧洲机构，专门在多边的基础上为经济不发达国家提供一般的出口信贷。显然，西欧计划在“援外”和资本输出上另起炉灶，不愿受美国羁绊。可是美国却千方百计，想把它们的计划纳入美国的轨道。9月底在华盛顿召开的国际货币基金组织和世界银行十四届年会上，美国财政部长安德逊提出成立“国际开发协会”，要西欧和日本为这个新机构多提供“援助”基金，就是这方面的一次尝试。虽然这个建议在美国压力下被强行通过，但据10月10日美国“商业周刊”透露，许多西欧国家和日本在会上都对这个机构的成立抱有保留意见：英国认为它已竭尽所能，在上个财政年度向不发达国家提供了三亿二千二百万美元的“赠予”和贷款，现在已没有力量提供更多的“援助”基金；西德当时表示只愿通过贷款给西德出口商的办法来“援助”不发达国家；法国则以阿尔及利亚战争为理由，表明无力“提供多余资金”。在这种情况下，美国“幸福”杂志曾指出：由于其他国家不肯多提供基金，“国际开发协会将又会成为只是空挂上一个国际名义的美国（援助）计划。”这事终于引起了美国决策当局的“强烈反应”。从10月初起，在华盛顿遂掀起一片对西欧国家不肯分担“援外”负担的厉声斥责，同时并扬言美国“将被迫彻底修改对西欧经济政策”相威胁。言外之意就是要限制西欧货物入口，减少对西欧的“援助”，作为要挟。为了责罚西欧国家和日本不愿多提供“援助”基金的“自私行为”，华盛顿还在它的“开发贷款基金会”的贷款条件中以及“国际合作署”所提供的长期工程贷款中加上了“买美国货”的限制，以实行所谓“谁提供援助，就买谁的货”的原则，以打击西欧国家和日本获取更多的美元外汇。可是尽管这样，华盛顿所施行的压力直到今天仍没有能使它的西欧伙伴迅速就范。
    美国统治当局就这样想借用“援助不发达国家”为名，玩弄一次“一箭双雕”的手法：既控制经济不发达国家，又控制它的伙伴西欧和日本。但是，不管西欧国家和日本是不是敢于同美国继续抗争，不屈服于美国所施加的压力，经济不发达国家的人民却越来越能看清楚美国的这条美元铐锁了。（附图片）
