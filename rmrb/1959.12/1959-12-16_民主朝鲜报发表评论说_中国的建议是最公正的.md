Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 15th. “Democratic Korea” published a commentary today stating that the proposal made by Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi in his letter to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio is the fairest and most reasonable solution to the Overseas Chinese issue currently existing between China and Indonesia. It clearly demonstrates the sincere efforts made by the Chinese government to safeguard the friendship between the two countries and to resolve the Overseas Chinese issue comprehensively. It is another concrete manifestation of the peaceful foreign policy consistently pursued by the government of the People's Republic of China.

The commentary expressed hope that the Indonesian government would accept this proposal and immediately take corresponding measures. It said: This will not only be of extremely important significance to maintaining the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, but also to consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

The commentary pointed out that after the Chinese government repeatedly drew the Indonesian government's attention to the matter, anti-China clamoring and anti-Chinese activities have not only not been stopped, but have continued to expand. The commentary expressed regret over this fact.

The commentary said that the imperialists headed by the United States are plotting vicious conspiracies in order to pursue the long-bankrupt "Cold War," to intensify international tensions, and to restore the collapsed colonial system in Asia. The commentary pointed out that, therefore, the issue of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia should be resolved satisfactorily as soon as possible on the basis of the Chinese government's proposal.

    民主朝鲜报发表评论说
    中国的建议是最公正的
    新华社平壤15日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论说：中国外交部长陈毅在他写给印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约的信中所提出的建议，是解决目前存在于中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的华侨问题的最公正和合理的方案。它清楚地表明中国政府为了维护两国之间的友谊和全盘解决华侨问题所作的诚挚的努力。它是中华人民共和国政府一贯执行的和平外交政策的又一个具体表现。
  评论表示希望印度尼西亚政府接受这一建议，并且立即采取相应的措施。它说：这将不仅对维护中国和印度尼西亚之间的友好关系，而且对巩固亚洲和世界和平也有极其重要的意义。
    评论指出，在中国政府屡次提请印度尼西亚政府加以注意之后，反华叫嚣和排华活动不仅没有被制止，反而继续扩大。评论对这一事实表示遗憾。
    评论说，以美国为首的帝国主义者为了追求早已破产的“冷战”，为了加剧国际紧张局势和在亚洲恢复崩溃了的殖民统治制度，正在策划着恶毒的阴谋。评论指出，因此，应该在中国政府的建议的基础上，早日圆满地解决在印度尼西亚的华侨的问题。
