Good Water and Soil Conservation Makes Clear Water Flow Forever

　　On November 9th, I visited the soil and water conservation project of the Jianchangou Team in the Hongqi Commune, Xiuyan County, Liaoning. When I reached the top of the mountain and looked around, I saw that the more than one thousand mu of mountain ridges were filled with fish-scale pits, resembling a huge carp lying horizontally there. Fruit trees, mulberry trees, and purple spiked willows were planted next to the pits. The eastern side of the gully was filled with layers of terraced fields. There was a large patch of young pine forest on the top of the mountain, showing a dark green color in the withered yellow grass.

　　Anyone who hadn't been here before would never have imagined that this was a barren mountain ridge only two years ago. In 1958, inspired by the General Line, people began to manage this barren mountain. Cadres from the soil and water conservation station helped with surveying and design, and the commune selected a portion of the labor force to organize a capital construction team, which began construction in March of last year.

　　Now, the more than 2,400 mu of barren slopes that have been treated have withstood the test of heavy rains in the summer and autumn seasons. The water in the terraced fields flows out of the drainage ditches in an orderly manner; the water flowing down the mountain is blocked by the valley weirs and slowly flows to the small river at the foot of the mountain. Thanks to the good water and soil conservation, Jianchangou's crops have had a bumper harvest this year. The soybeans in the terraced fields yielded more than 200 jin per mu; the sorghum yielded more than 400 jin per mu; the Chinese cabbages grew large and leafy, not worse than the cabbages in the commune members' own gardens. The commune members said: This is a bumper harvest that Jianchangou has not had for many years.

    水土保持好　清水永长流
    11月9日，我参观了辽宁岫岩县红旗公社茧场沟小队的治山治水工程。当我走上山顶，四下一望，在一千多亩的山岭上，挖满了鱼鳞坑，好像一条巨大的鲤鱼横卧在那里。坑旁栽植着果树、桑树和紫穗
　。沟的东面是层层的水平梯田。山顶上有好大一片小松林，在枯黄的草丛里，显出黑绿色。
    过去没有来过这里的人，谁会想到两年前这儿还是个荒山秃岭呢？1958年在总路线的鼓舞下，人们开始治理这座荒山。水土保持站的干部在这里帮助勘测设计，社里抽出了一部分劳动力组织基建队，去年3月间，就开始动工了。
    现在，经过治理的两千四百多亩荒坡，已经经过了夏秋两季大雨的考验。梯田里的水，从排水沟里规规矩矩地流出来；山上淌下来的水，经过谷坊阻挡，慢慢地向山下的小河流去。由于水土保持搞的好，今年茧场沟的庄稼获得了大丰收。梯田上的大豆，每亩打了二百多斤；高粱亩产四百多斤；大白菜长的棵大叶肥，比社员园子里的白菜都不坏。社员们说：这是茧场沟多少年来没有过的大丰收。
