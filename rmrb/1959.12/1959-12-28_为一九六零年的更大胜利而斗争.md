Strive for Greater Victory in 1960
Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction and inspired and encouraged by the banner of Mao Zedong, the people of Hebei Province have thoroughly implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Through the struggle against right-leaning tendencies, they have mustered revolutionary zeal and launched an in-depth movement to increase production and practice economy, achieving a great victory in the sustained leap forward of various socialist construction undertakings in Hebei Province in 1959. Now, the vast numbers of cadres and masses in Hebei Province are stepping into 1960 with confidence and heroic strides, a year destined for even greater victories.

Found the Road to Sustained Leap Forward

In 1959, Hebei Province's total industrial and agricultural output value is expected to increase by 39.8% compared to the extraordinary leap forward of 1958. In industry, the total output value increased by 47%, steel by 34.8%, pig iron by 2.4 times, and coal by 43.2%. It should be emphasized that the industrial leap forward in 1959 was a leap forward characterized by high output and high quality, as well as economy and safety. The vast majority of enterprises completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded their targets, with 2,070 enterprises at or above the county level entering 1960 one month in advance. In agriculture, the total output value increased by 24.2% compared to 1958, with total output of grain, cotton, and peanuts, and the development of live pigs increasing by about 11%, 20%, 20%, and 43% respectively. Furthermore, the per-unit area yield of grain in twenty-three counties in two special zones exceeded the 400-jin target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. The continuous leap forward in grain production has enabled Hebei Province to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, which is a significant change in the agricultural development of Hebei Province. In transportation, capital construction, finance and trade, culture and education, etc., plans were also overfulfilled and leaps forward were achieved. In 1959, tens of thousands of heroic figures emerged on all fronts. They highly promoted the communist style, dared to think and act, were courageous in creation, boldly innovated, worked selflessly, did not care about remuneration, put others before themselves, and supported each other. Wherever there were difficulties, they went there. Their noble style fully demonstrated the great improvement of the socialist and communist ideological consciousness of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in Hebei Province under the leadership of the Party.

The fact that a continued leap forward was achieved in 1959 on the road of the Great Leap Forward initiated in 1958 eloquently proves that the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" and the whole set of policies of "walking on two legs" are completely correct. It is now becoming increasingly clear to people that the Party's General Line for socialist construction gives us not just the leap forward of individual departments, but the leap forward of the entire national economy; not just the leap forward of individual years, but a continuous leap forward. It can be said that the foundation for the rapid development of our socialist construction has been laid, and the road to sustained leap forward has been found.

The fact of sustained leap forward also fully proves that the people's communes, the inevitable product of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, have incomparable superiority and strong vitality, and are the best basic social organizational form for accelerating agricultural development and thus accelerating the progress of the entire socialist construction.

The fact of the sustained leap forward of the national economy has once again vividly and powerfully proved that whether carrying out socialist revolution or socialist construction, it is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's policy of putting politics in command and launching mass movements on a large scale.

It is precisely because we have firmly implemented the General Line, which fully reflects the laws of socialist construction in our country, and the whole set of policies of "walking on two legs," resolutely rectified, consolidated, and developed the people's communes, and resolutely implemented the policy of putting politics in command and launching mass movements on a large scale, that we have most widely mobilized the people and most fully brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, ensuring the continued leap forward of socialist construction.

The General Line, the whole set of policies of "walking on two legs," the people's communes, putting politics in command, and launching mass movements on a large scale are all created by combining the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959 are precisely the victory of the thought of combining the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and the victory of the thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. The banner of Comrade Mao Zedong is the banner that leads us continuously from victory to greater victory. The right-leaning opportunists, in an attempt to hinder the development of our cause, viciously attacked precisely the most fundamental things that enabled us to achieve victory. However, the vivid facts of 1959 so powerfully show how absurd the right-leaning opportunist arguments are, how brilliant the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong is, and how diligent and courageous our workers, peasants, and intellectuals are.

Must First Ensure the Leap Forward of Agriculture

We absolutely do not think that we have done enough because we have already achieved victory. What lies before us is the increasingly gigantic glorious task of economic construction and cultural construction. In order to build China into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long period, at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the new historical tasks of technological revolution and the cultural revolution that complements the technological revolution to the whole Party and the people of the whole country. At the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong again called on the whole Party and the people of the whole country to strive to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in about ten years and put forward the requirement to strive to complete the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The Party organizations and the people of the whole province must be more energetic and strive for progress, and strive for the continued leap forward of the national economy in the coming years, especially in 1960. 1960 is a year in which the agricultural technological transformation of Hebei Province will inevitably develop even greater, and a year in which the industry, agriculture, transportation, and other economic and cultural undertakings of Hebei Province will inevitably leap forward even greater.

In promoting the leap forward of the entire national economy, we must correctly arrange and handle the relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, and first ensure the leap forward of agriculture, and promote the development of the entire national economy through the leap forward of agriculture. The position of agriculture in the entire national economy, as the Party Central Committee pointed out, in a country like China with a large population and vast land and resources, agriculture is the foundation for the development of the national economy. On this point, Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1945 in "On Coalition Government": "The peasants—this is the main body of the Chinese industrial market. Only they can supply the most abundant food and raw materials and absorb the largest amount of industrial products." For ten years, the experience of economic recovery and economic construction in Hebei Province has fully proved the role of agricultural development in promoting the development of the entire national economy. In 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong further elaborated in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "China is a large agricultural country, and the rural population accounts for more than 80% of the country's population. The development of industry must be carried out simultaneously with the development of agriculture. Only then will industry have raw materials and markets, and only then will it be possible to accumulate more funds for the establishment of a strong heavy industry." Simultaneously developing industry and agriculture is an important basic point of the Party's General Line for socialist construction. Therefore, we must combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and implement the policy of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously.

Achieving the technological transformation of agriculture as soon as possible is of paramount importance for accelerating the speed of socialist construction. Because Hebei Province's iron and steel industry and machinery manufacturing industry have already made great progress, and because the people's communes are becoming increasingly consolidated and stronger, we have the possibility of basically realizing the water conservancy, mechanization, and initial electrification of agriculture after three to five years of hard work. In the struggle to realize the technological transformation of agriculture, the problem of water should be solved first. As long as we adhere to the policy of the mass line in water conservancy construction, rely on the great strength of the people's communes, and work hard for two winter and spring seasons, we will be able to basically realize water conservancy throughout the province and eliminate drought and flood disasters. In order to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, we must adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs." On the one hand, according to the situation of agricultural machinery production, mechanization should be gradually realized with priorities and step by step. At the same time, we must vigorously promote tool reform, manufacture indigenous tools and machinery, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and actively create conditions for mechanization from indigenous to foreign methods. Similarly, in order to ensure increased agricultural production and solve the fertilizer problem, we must also combine indigenous and foreign methods, and give priority to indigenous methods. That is, relying on vigorously raising pigs to increase organic fertilizer. One pig is a small organic fertilizer factory. Therefore, we must launch a great revolution in animal husbandry production, and be determined to achieve an average of one pig per rural population in the province next year, and some areas should strive to exceed this.

It must also be emphasized here that the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural increase is the fundamental plan to ensure agricultural harvest, and resolutely implementing it and further improving the level of garden-style management that comprehensively applies the "Eight-Character Charter" will surely ensure the continued leap forward of agricultural production in 1960.

Industry Should Take Steel as the Key Link and Achieve Overall Leap Forward

While promoting the comprehensive development of agricultural production, we should actively further develop light industrial production to supply the people with more necessities of life. With the development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase of people's income, the broad masses of people have put forward more demands for necessities of life, and our light industrial production should strive to adapt to this demand. In order to increase the output of light industrial products, agriculture should first be required to provide a large amount of diverse raw materials, and we must also try every means to expand the sources of various raw materials and actively develop the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products. In order to further change the face of light industrial production in Hebei Province, on the one hand, we must carry out key construction of light industry, increase equipment, make up for shortcomings, and develop county and commune processing industries in a planned way according to the principle of rational layout; at the same time, we must also actively improve product quality, increase varieties and designs, and develop towards high-end and precision.

In order to support the technological transformation of agriculture and adhere to the high-speed development of industry, the industrial front in 1960 should continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving overall leap forward. On the one hand, vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, improve the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization, improve equipment utilization rate and labor productivity, continue to carry out the high-yield, high-quality, and energy-saving movement, and fully tap the production potential of existing enterprises. At the same time, under the unified planning of the country, actively focus on the construction of new enterprises, especially strengthening the construction of weak links such as power, mining, and raw material industries, as well as the exploration and exploitation of non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and petroleum.

The leap forward of industrial and agricultural production must be strongly supported by the transportation industry, commerce, as well as finance and financial work. All these aspects should continue to leap forward in 1960. In transportation, we should further exploit the potential of existing equipment, strengthen the construction of railways and ports, increase new transportation equipment, strengthen the cooperation of all relevant parties, vigorously organize civil transportation forces, and develop short-distance transportation, so that transportation can adapt to the needs of the leap forward of industrial and agricultural production. Financial and trade work should start from production, and promote the development of production, especially agricultural production, through exchange and distribution, in order to meet the needs of people's lives.

Push the Cultural Revolution to a New Climax

In order to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the national economy, and in order to cooperate with the continuous leap forward of industry and agriculture, it is necessary to vigorously carry out the cultural revolution, and push the already started cultural revolution movement to a new climax. The high-speed development of industry and agriculture requires a large number of technical cadres and workers with communist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge. Therefore, in 1960, we must continue to vigorously promote the popularization of culture, vigorously run technical education, vigorously run spare-time education, and actively improve higher education, in order to improve the communist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge level of workers and peasants at the fastest speed, and gradually complete the great historical task of intellectualizing workers and peasants. The experience of the Great Leap Forward proves that to carry out the cultural revolution in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, we must thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, comprehensively plan, launch mass movements on a large scale, and conscientiously implement the policy of "walking on two legs," and implement the principle of combining unity and diversity, combining popularization and improvement, and implement all the people running schools, that is, the state running schools and factories, mines, enterprises, agencies, and people's communes running schools, both ordinary education and vocational education, both children's education and adult education, both school education and self-study, both free education and non-free education, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of all aspects of society to run schools to meet the needs of the masses and the needs of national construction.

We must pay attention to grasping the work of key improvement while extensively popularizing culture and education. Establish lofty ambitions and great aspirations, resolutely take down the modern cultural and scientific fortress, quickly grasp the cutting edge of world science and technology, and cultivate and establish a technical cadre team of the working class. At the same time, we must enable our culture, art, health, sports, and other cultural and educational undertakings to have corresponding development.

Can we successfully realize the continued leap forward in 1960? The answer is yes. We have all the necessary favorable conditions and many favorable factors to ensure the glorious task of realizing the continued leap forward of economic construction and cultural construction in 1960. As mentioned earlier, the victory of the continued leap forward in 1959 and the victory of the struggle against right-leaning tendencies have provided favorable political, ideological, material, and technical conditions for the continued leap forward in 1960. After the struggle against right-leaning tendencies, the broad masses of cadres and masses have more deeply realized that the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the whole set of policies of "walking on two legs," and the policies of putting politics in command and launching mass movements on a large scale, not only point out the correct path and correct methods for the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country, but also precisely the guarantee for the continued leap forward. Therefore, their confidence, determination, and enthusiasm for implementing the General Line and the Party's policies have become even greater. At the same time, after the practice of 1958 and 1959, our Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of cadres and masses have accumulated considerable rich experience. Our people's communes, after rectification, have embarked on the road of consolidation and sound development in the struggle against nature and in the struggle between the two roads, and will inevitably play a greater role in the development of production. Our material and technical foundations, after two consecutive years of leap forward, are much stronger than in the past, whether from the equipment capacity of industrial production or from the construction of farmland water conservancy. As long as we have greater enthusiasm and fully use and bring into play these favorable conditions and favorable factors, we will surely be able to successfully complete the tasks of economic and cultural construction in 1960.

The General Line Is the Key Link of All Work

In order to achieve greater victory in 1960, the Party organizations and the people of the whole province of Hebei must hold high the red flag of the General Line, take the General Line as the key link to lift all work, and as the driving force for winning greater victory. To adhere to the General Line, we must deeply carry out the struggle between the two roads, and further arm the masses with the Party's General Line, and constantly oppose right-leaning thoughts. We must know that right-leaning thoughts will often appear on our road of advancement. It binds the thoughts and hands of the masses and hinders the high-speed development of socialist construction. Constantly criticizing and overcoming right-leaning thoughts can make the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses constantly high, and it will also make the mass movement of socialist construction develop more deeply and lastingly.

In order to successfully realize the tasks of 1960, in order to continuously develop production and construction, we must vigorously carry out the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, and push this movement to a new climax. On the industrial and capital construction fronts, the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement must adhere to the principle of letting go of mobilizing the masses and all things through experimentation, and around the key issues in production, actively improve equipment, improve operation methods, improve product design, adopt new raw materials and materials, and find substitutes, and gradually mechanize and semi-mechanize manual labor, in order to greatly improve labor productivity, improve the quantity and quality of products, and reduce the consumption of raw materials and materials. At the same time, we should strive to overcome cutting-edge technology. Whether it is an outdated small and medium-sized enterprise or a large enterprise with modern equipment, technological innovation and technological revolution should be carried out. In technological innovation and technological revolution, we must implement the policy of "walking on two legs," and adopt foreign methods if we can, and adopt indigenous methods if we cannot, and combine foreign and indigenous methods. At present, the technological innovation and technological revolution on the industrial front in Hebei Province have been widely carried out, and have created many good experiences, which should be summarized and promoted in a timely manner to promote the further in-depth development of the movement.

In all enterprises and rural people's communes, we should further widely carry out the socialist labor competition of comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward. Carrying out this kind of competition and changing the production level of a few advanced people into the production level of the whole society is an important method for us to improve production in socialist society. At present, there are many advanced producers and advanced production units who not only maintain their own advanced level, but also help the backward catch up with the advanced level. This is a communist style worth greatly promoting, and an important manifestation of the further improvement of the communist consciousness of the people, which is the most important feature of the in-depth development of the mass movement of our socialist construction. The technical performance competitions implemented by some enterprises and the "hand-in-hand competitions" launched between teams and teams, communes and communes in many people's communes, as well as other competition forms created by many units and regions, play an important role in promoting the "comparison, catch-up, learning, and help" movement, and should be widely used.

In order to successfully complete the tasks of 1960, we must also greatly promote socialist large-scale cooperation. Not only within an enterprise, but also between various enterprises and industries, between production, transportation, and supply, and between people's communes, we must promote large-scale cooperation. Under the socialist system, the consistency of the fundamental interests of individuals and collectives, and the necessity of mutual cooperation between enterprises and enterprises are determined, and therefore they must and can consciously support and closely cooperate with each other. This kind of cooperation can create new and greater productive forces. For the rapid development of our cause, every region or enterprise should greatly promote the communist style of obeying the collective, taking care of the overall situation, putting others before themselves, and cooperating with each other.

In order to successfully complete the tasks of 1960, and for the high-speed development of socialist construction, we must further promote the spirit of self-reliance and building the country with diligence and thrift, and adhere to the combination of hard work, practical work, and skillful work. We have done this in the past and achieved great achievements in the continued leap forward, and in order to build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science, and culture at the fastest speed, we must continue to work hard, be diligent and thrifty, accumulate more and consume less, live rich days as poor days, and combine current interests with long-term interests. We must combine political education for the masses with material encouragement, and must take politics as the soul and commander. Only by embracing the communist ambition and great aspirations, carrying forward the spirit of continuous revolution, self-reliance, and hard work can we reach our great goals at the fastest speed.

In order to better promote socialist construction, and in order to successfully shoulder the increasingly greater construction tasks, we must further strengthen the study and propaganda movement of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the socialist and communist ideological education of the people, strengthen the in-depth and specific propaganda of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and further arm the masses with the spirit of the General Line. It must be pointed out that we must never relax political and ideological work slightly because the struggle against right-leaning opportunist ideology has achieved great victory, and precisely the experience of this struggle profoundly shows that adhering to the implementation of the Party's General Line for socialist construction is a serious class struggle, and shows that the struggle between the two roads, two kinds of thoughts, and two kinds of world outlook on the political and ideological front is long-term. Without the proletarian world outlook, it is impossible to adhere to and implement the Party's General Line. Therefore, launching a deep and lasting movement to study Comrade Mao Zedong's thought throughout the Party, and further arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, has extremely great significance for ensuring the implementation of the Party's General Line, for ensuring the victorious development of our socialist construction, and for the transition from socialism to communism in the future.

Let the Party organizations and the people of the whole province hold high the banner of Comrade Mao Zedong and advance bravely to fight for greater victory in 1960.

　　为一九六零年的更大胜利而斗争
　　中共河北省委第一书记　林铁
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在毛泽东旗帜的指引和鼓舞下，河北全省人民深入贯彻了党的八届八中全会决议，经过反右倾斗争，鼓足革命干劲，深入开展了增产节约运动，使河北省社会主义建设的各项事业，取得了1959年持续跃进的伟大胜利。现在，河北全省广大干部和群众，正满怀信心地迈着英雄的步伐，跨入必将取得更大胜利的1960年。
    找到了持续跃进的道路
    1959年，河北省工农业总产值预计比特大跃进的1958年增长39.8％。在工业方面，总产值增长47％，钢增长34.8％，生铁增长二点四倍，煤增长43.2％。应该强调指出的是，1959年的工业大跃进是既高产又优质，既节约又安全的大跃进。绝大多数企业提前超额完成了全年的生产计划，有二千零七十个县以上的企业提前一个月跨入了1960年。在农业方面，总产值比1958年增长了24.2％，粮食、棉花、花生的总产量和生猪的发展，分别增长11、20、20和43左右。并且有两个专区二十三个县的粮食单位面积产量，超过了全国农业发展纲要规定的四百斤指标。由于粮食生产的不断跃进，已经使河北省粮食达到了自给自足，这是河北省农业发展过程中一个有重大意义的变化。在交通运输、基本建设、财政贸易、文化教育等方面也都超额完成了计划和有了飞跃的发展。1959年，在各个战线上，涌现了成千上万的英雄人物。他们高度发扬了共产主义风格，敢想敢干，勇于创造，大胆革新，忘我劳动，不计报酬，先人后己，相互支援，哪里有困难就到哪里去。他们的崇高风格，充分地表现了河北省工人、农民、知识分子在党的领导下社会主义和共产主义思想觉悟的大大提高。
    在1958年开创的大跃进的道路上，接着又取得1959年继续跃进的事实，雄辩地证明了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针是完全正确的。现在已经使得人们愈来愈看得清楚，党的社会主义建设的总路线给予我们的不是个别部门的跃进，而是整个国民经济的跃进；也不是个别年份的跃进，而是持续不断的跃进。可以说，我们的社会主义建设事业飞跃发展的基础已经奠定了，持续跃进的道路已经找到了。
    持续跃进的事实，也充分证明了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的必然产物——人民公社，有不可比拟的优越性和强大的生命力，是加速农业发展从而加速整个社会主义建设事业前进的最好的基层的社会组织形式。
    国民经济持续跃进的事实，又一次更加生动地有力地证明了无论进行社会主义革命或者社会主义建设，必须坚决贯彻执行党的政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的方针。
    正是因为我们坚定地贯彻执行了充分反映我国社会主义建设规律的总路线以及一整套两条腿走路的方针，坚决地整顿、巩固、发展了人民公社和坚决地执行了政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的方针，因而最广泛地动员了人民群众和最充分地发挥了人民群众的积极性、创造性，保证了社会主义建设事业的继续跃进。
    总路线、一整套两条腿走路的方针、人民公社、政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，都是马克思列宁主义的革命原理和中国革命的具体实践相结合而创造出来的。1958年的大跃进，1959年的继续跃进，正是马克思列宁主义的革命原理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的思想的胜利，正是我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志思想的胜利。毛泽东同志的旗帜，是我们不断地由胜利走向更大胜利的旗帜。右倾机会主义分子企图阻碍我们的事业的发展而恶毒攻击的正是上述我们所以能够取得胜利的最根本的东西。但是，1959年活生生的事实如此有力地表明右倾机会主义的论调是多么荒谬，党中央和毛泽东同志的领导是多么英明，我们的工人、农民和知识分子是多么勤劳勇敢。
    必须首先保证农业的跃进
    我们绝对不因为已经取得的胜利，便认为作得够了。摆在我们面前的是愈来愈巨大的经济建设和文化建设的光荣任务。为了在一个不太长的时间内把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，在党的八大二次会议上，党中央和毛泽东同志向全党和全国人民提出了技术革命以及同技术革命相辅而行的文化革命的新的历史任务，在党的八届八中全会上党中央和毛泽东同志又向全党和全国人民发出了争取在十年左右的时间内，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国的号召，提出了争取大大提前完成全国农业发展纲要的要求。我们全省党的组织和全省人民必须更加鼓足干劲、力争上游，争取在今后的年份，首先是1960年国民经济的继续跃进。1960年是河北省农业技术改造必将更大发展的一年，是河北省工业、农业、交通运输以及其他经济事业和文化事业必将更大跃进的一年。
    在促进整个国民经济的跃进中，我们必须正确安排和处理农业、轻工业和重工业的关系，首先保证农业的跃进，通过农业的跃进，促进整个国民经济的发展。农业在整个国民经济中的地位，正如党中央所指出的，在我们中国这样一个人口众多、地大物博的国度里，农业是国民经济发展的基础。对于这一点，毛主席早在1945年所写的“论联合政府”中就指出：“农民——这是中国工业市场的主体。只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”十年来，河北省经济恢复和经济建设的经验，充分地证明了农业的发展对于促进整个国民经济发展的作用。1957年，毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中，又进一步阐述：“我国是一个大农业国，农村人口占全国人口的百分之八十以上，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。”工业和农业同时并举，这是党的社会主义建设总路线的一个重要的基本点。因此，我们必须把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，贯彻执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针。
    尽快地实现农业的技术改造，对于加快社会主义建设的速度有头等重要的意义。由于河北省钢铁工业和机械制造工业已经有了很大的发展，由于人民公社的日益巩固、壮大，我们有可能经过三、五年的苦战，基本实现农业的水利化、机械化和初步电气化。在为实现农业技术改造而进行的斗争中，应该先解决水的问题。只要我们坚持贯彻水利建设上的群众路线的方针，依靠人民公社的巨大力量，大干两个冬春，就能够在全省范围内基本实现水利化，解除旱涝灾害。为了加速实现农业机械化，必须坚持实行两条腿走路的方针。一方面根据农业机械生产的情况，有先有后，由点到面，逐步实现机械化。同时，必须大搞工具改革，制造土工具，土机械，作到土洋结合，由土到洋，积极地为机械化创造条件。同样，为了保证农业增产，解决肥料问题，也必须土洋结合，而且要以土为主。这就是依靠大搞养猪，增加有机肥料。一头猪就是一个小型的有机化肥厂。因此，我们必须在畜牧生产上掀起一个大革命，立志明年全省达到按农村人口平均一人一猪，有些地区还应该努力争取超过。
    这里还必须强调指出，农业增产的“八字宪法”是保证农业丰收的根本大计，坚决地贯彻执行，并且进一步提高综合运用八字宪法的园田化的水平，就一定能够保证1960年农业生产的继续跃进。
    工业方面要以钢为纲全面跃进
    在促进农业生产全面发展的同时，应当积极地进一步发展轻工业生产，以供应人民更多的生活必需品。随着工农业生产的发展和人民收入的增长，广大人民对生活必需品提出了更多的要求，我们的轻工业生产应当努力去适应这种要求。为了增加轻工业产品的产量，首先要求农业提供大量的多种多样的原料，并且还要千方百计地扩大各种原料的来源，积极开展对于农副产品的综合利用。为了进一步改变河北省轻工业生产的面貌，一方面，必须进行轻工业的重点建设，增加设备，补足缺门，按照合理布局的原则有计划地发展县社加工工业；同时，还要积极地提高产品质量，增加花色品种，向高、精发展。
    为了支援农业的技术改造和坚持工业的高速度发展，1960年工业战线上应当继续贯彻执行以钢为纲，全面跃进的方针。一方面，大搞技术革新和技术革命，提高机械化和半机械化的水平，提高设备利用率和劳动生产率，继续开展高产、优质、节约运动，充分发掘原有企业的生产潜力。同时，要在全国统一规划下，积极地重点进行新企业的建设，特别是加强电力、矿山采掘、原材料工业等薄弱环节的建设，以及有色金属、稀有金属和石油的勘探和开采工作。
    工农业生产的跃进，必须有交通运输业、商业以及财政和金融工作的大力支援。所有这些方面，在1960年都应当继续跃进。交通运输方面，应当进一步发挥原有设备的潜力，加强铁路和港口的建设，增加新的运输设备，加强各有关方面的协作，大力组织民间的运输力量，发展短途运输，使运输适应工农业生产跃进的需要。财贸工作要从生产出发，通过交换和分配，促进生产的发展，特别是农业生产的发展，以满足人民生活的需要。
    把文化革命推向新高潮
    为了适应国民经济高速度发展的需要，为了配合工业、农业的持续跃进，必须大搞文化革命，使已经开始的文化革命运动推向新的高潮。工农业的高速度发展，需要大量的具有共产主义觉悟和文化科学知识的技术干部和工人。因此，在1960年，我们必须继续大搞普及文化、大办技术教育、大办业余教育，积极提高高等教育，以便用最快的速度提高工农群众的共产主义觉悟和文化科学知识水平，逐步完成工农群众知识化这个伟大的历史任务。大跃进的经验证明，要多快好省地进行文化革命，必须彻底反掉右倾，全面规划，大搞群众运动，认真贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针，在统一性与多样性相结合，普及与提高相结合的原则下，实行全党全民办学。即国家办学与厂矿、企业、机关、人民公社办学并举，普通教育与职业教育并举，儿童教育与成人教育并举，学校教育与自学并举，免费教育与不免费教育并举，充分调动社会上各方面办学的积极性，来满足群众的需要和国家建设的需要。
    我们必须注意在文化教育大普及的同时，抓紧重点提高的工作。树雄心、立大志，坚决拿下现代文化科学堡垒，迅速地掌握世界科学技术的尖端，培养建立起一支工人阶级的技术干部队伍。同时，要使我们的文化、艺术、卫生、体育事业和其他文教事业都有相应的发展。
    我们能不能够胜利实现1960年的继续跃进呢？回答是肯定的。我们具有一切必要的有利条件和许多有利因素，以保证实现1960年经济建设和文化建设继续跃进的光荣任务。正如前面所说，1959年继续跃进的胜利和反右倾斗争的胜利，为1960年的继续跃进提供了政治思想的和物质技术的有利条件。广大干部和群众，经过反右倾斗争，更加深刻地体会到党的社会主义建设总路线，一整套两条腿走路的方针，以及政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的方针，不仅指出了我国社会主义建设高速度发展的正确道路、正确方法，而且正是持续跃进的保证。因而，他们对于执行总路线和党的方针的信心、决心和干劲更大了。同时，经过1958年和1959年的实践，我们各级党组织和广大干部、群众，已经积累了相当丰富的经验。我们的人民公社经过整顿，在向自然斗争以及在两条道路斗争中，已经走上巩固的和健全发展的道路，对于生产的发展，必将愈来愈发挥更大的作用。我们的物质技术基础，经过连续两年的跃进，不论从工业生产的设备能力，或者是农田水利建设等方面来看，都比过去的条件强大的多了。只要有更大的干劲，充分运用和发挥这些有利条件和有利因素，我们就一定能够胜利地完成1960年的经济、文化建设的任务。
    总路线是一切工作的纲
    为了1960年取得更大的胜利，河北全省党的组织和全省人民必须更高地举起总路线的红旗，把总路线作为提起一切工作的纲，作为夺取更大胜利的动力。要坚持总路线，就必须深入开展两条道路的斗争，用党的总路线，进一步武装群众，不断地反对右倾思想。要知道，右倾思想在我们前进的道路上是会经常出现的，它束缚群众的思想和手脚，阻碍社会主义建设事业的高速度发展。不断地批判和克服右倾思想，就可以使群众的革命热情不断地高涨，也就会使社会主义建设的群众运动更加深入地持久地发展下去。
    为了胜利实现1960年的任务，为了不断地发展生产和建设，必须大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，并且把这个运动推向新的高潮。在工业和基本建设战线上，当前的技术革新和技术革命运动，必须按照放手发动群众，一切经过试验的原则，围绕生产中的关键问题，积极地改进设备，改进操作方法，改善产品设计，采用新的原料、材料和寻找代用品，并且使手工劳动逐步机械化和半机械化，以大大提高劳动生产率，提高产品的数量和质量，降低原料、材料的消耗。同时，应当努力攻克尖端技术。不论设备陈旧的中小企业、还是现代化设备的大型企业，都应当进行技术革新和技术革命。在技术革新和技术革命中，必须贯彻两条腿走路的方针，能采用洋办法的就采用洋办法，不能采用洋办法的就采用土办法，把洋的和土的结合起来。现在河北省工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命已经广泛开展起来，并且创造了很多好经验，应该及时总结推广，以推动运动进一步地深入发展。
    在一切企业单位和农村人民公社，要进一步广泛开展比先进、赶先进、学先进、帮后进的社会主义劳动竞赛。开展这种竞赛，变少数先进者的生产水平为全社会的生产水平，这是我们社会主义社会提高生产的重要方法。目前有许多的先进生产者和先进生产单位，不仅自己保持先进，而且帮助落后赶上先进的水平。这是一种值得大大发扬的共产主义风格，是人民群众共产主义觉悟进一步提高的重要表现，这是我们的社会主义建设的群众运动深入发展的最重要的特点。有些企业单位实行的技术表演赛和许多人民公社在队和队、社和社之间开展的“携手赛”，以及不少单位和地区创造的其他竞赛形式，对于推动“比、赶、学、帮”的运动，有重要作用，应该广泛地加以运用。
    为了胜利地完成1960年的任务，我们还要大大提倡社会主义的大协作。不仅在一个企业内部，在各个企业、产业之间，在生产、运输、供应各个环节之间，在人民公社之间，都要提倡大协作。在社会主义制度下，决定了个人和集体之间，企业和企业之间根本利益的一致性和相互协作的必要性，因而必须和能够自觉地互相支援和密切协作。这种协作可以创造出新的更大的生产力。为了我们事业的迅速发展，每一个地区或企业单位，都要大大发扬服从集体、照顾大局、先人后己、相互协作的共产主义风格。
    为了胜利地完成1960年的任务，为了社会主义建设事业高速度地发展，我们必须进一步发扬自力更生和勤俭建国的精神，坚持苦干、实干、巧干相结合。我们过去这样做了，取得了持续跃进的伟大成就。为了以最快的速度把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，我们必须继续艰苦奋斗，克勤克俭，必须多积累一些，少消费一些，把富日子当穷日子过，把目前利益和长远利益结合起来。要把对群众的政治教育和物质鼓励结合起来，而且必须以政治为灵魂、为统帅。只有抱定共产主义的雄心大志，发扬不断革命的精神，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，才能以最快的速度达到我们的伟大目标。
    为了更好地推进社会主义建设，为了胜利地担负愈来愈大的建设任务，我们必须进一步加强马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的学习和宣传运动，加强人民群众的社会主义和共产主义思想教育，加强党的社会主义建设总路线的深入具体的宣传，用总路线的精神进一步武装群众。必须指出，绝不能因为反对右倾机会主义思想的斗争已经取得巨大胜利而稍微放松政治思想工作，恰恰是这个斗争的经验深刻地说明了，坚持贯彻党的社会主义建设的总路线，是一场严重的阶级斗争，说明了在政治思想战线上两条道路、两种思想、两种世界观的斗争是长期的。没有无产阶级的世界观，就不可能坚持贯彻执行党的总路线。因此，在全党掀起一个深入持久的学习毛泽东同志思想的运动，用毛泽东思想进一步武装我们的头脑，对于保证党的总路线的贯彻，对于保证我们的社会主义建设事业的胜利发展和在将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义，有极其伟大的意义。
    让我们全省党的组织和全省人民更高地举起毛泽东同志的旗帜，奋勇前进，为夺取1960年的更大胜利而斗争。
