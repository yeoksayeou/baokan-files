    Jinan Winter Mass Sports Activities
    Jinan City is carrying out mass winter sports activities. The number of people participating in physical exercise in various enterprises, government offices, and schools has increased compared to previous years. Currently, 260,000 people are participating in the symbolic relay long-distance running event "One Day 10,000 Meters High-Speed Leap Over 1960," which is being launched throughout the city.
    In recent years, the people of Jinan City have persisted in regular physical exercise, which has enhanced people's physical fitness and promoted production. Moreover, a group of outstanding athletes has emerged on the basis of the popularity of sports.

    Female workers from the Jinan Renfeng Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory are doing "textile exercises" after work. These textile exercises are a simple form of gymnastics created by the factory itself based on the physical conditions of textile workers.
    Residents also participate in physical exercise. Women are often seen participating in tug-of-war competitions on Sili Street in Lixia District, Jinan.
    The field long-distance running team of Jinan Dongyuansheng Printing and Dyeing Factory has set off again. Leading the way is advanced producer and sports enthusiast Jia Chengde.
    In the early morning, Tai Chi enthusiasts practice boxing by the Daming Lake.
