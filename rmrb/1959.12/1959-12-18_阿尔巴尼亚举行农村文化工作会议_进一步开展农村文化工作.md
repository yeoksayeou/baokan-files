Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 17th: In order to further develop rural cultural work, the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian Council of Ministers held a national rural cultural work conference in Tirana on the 15th and 16th.

Albanian party and government leaders Hoxha, Shehu and others attended the meeting.

Party Central Committee Secretary Belishova gave a report at the meeting. She pointed out that with the rapid development of the national agricultural economy, rural culture should also have a high degree of development. The primary task of current rural cultural work is to make culture powerfully serve the political and economic tasks of socialist construction. Rural cultural work should be closely integrated with production. At the same time, education and political propaganda in rural areas should be strengthened, backward customs should be opposed, and a cultured life should be established in rural areas.

Since liberation, the cultural work in the vast rural areas of Albania has achieved remarkable development, and the face of the countryside has been greatly changed. In the past, farmers and their children had few opportunities for education, and about 90% of farmers were illiterate, but today, of the 2,275 primary schools in the country, 2,129 are located in rural areas, and of the more than 170,000 primary school students, 120,000 are children of farmers. In the past, there were no seven-year schools in rural areas, but now there are 366. At present, there are more than 5,000 teachers in rural areas, and a total of more than 1,400 technical and medical personnel.

Before liberation, there was no cultural life to speak of in rural Albania, but now almost all towns have their own cultural centers, historical showrooms and museums. According to statistics, there are 710 large and small cultural centers and 34 cultural palaces in rural areas across the country. Historical showrooms have been established in 204 villages, and local chronicles have been compiled in more than 1,700 villages. More than 116,000 farmers have participated in amateur cultural and recreational activities.

    阿尔巴尼亚举行农村文化工作会议
    进一步开展农村文化工作
    新华社地拉那17日电　为了进一步开展农村文化工作，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和阿尔巴尼亚部长会议15、16两日在地拉那召开了全国农村文化工作会议。
    阿尔巴尼亚党政领导人霍查、谢胡等出席了会议。
    党中央书记别利绍娃在会上做了报告。她指出，随着全国农业经济的迅速发展，农村文化也应该有高度的发展。当前农村文化工作的首要任务在于使文化有力地为社会主义建设的政治和经济任务服务。农村文化工作应该紧密地和生产相结合。同时，还应加强农村的教育和政治宣传工作，反对落后习俗，在农村建立起有文化的生活。
    解放以来，阿尔巴尼亚广大农村的文化工作获得了显著的发展，农村面貌已大大改观。过去，农民和他们的子女很少有受教育的机会，约有90％的农民是文盲，但今天全国二千二百七十五所小学中，就有二千一百二十九所设在农村，十七万多名小学生中，有十二万名是农民的子弟。过去农村中一所七年制学校也没有，现在已经有了三百六十六所。目前，在农村的教师已有五千多人，技术人员和医务人员共有一千四百多人。
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚农村中根本谈不到什么文化生活，但是现在，差不多所有城镇都有了自己的文化中心、历史陈列室和博物馆。据统计，全国农村共有大小文化中心七百一十个，文化宫三十四个，已经有二百零四个村子建立了历史陈列室，一千七百多个村编写了自己的地方志。参加业余文娱活动的农民已经达十一万六千多人。
