Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 25th: "Izvestia" today published an article entitled "Two Tendencies," stating that the U.S., British, and French heads of government, with the participation of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, proposed to the Soviet Union to hold a top-level meeting in Paris on April 27. This is a great achievement of the peace-loving forces, the result of long-term efforts. Now, even the most fanatical supporters of the "Cold War" can no longer openly show their faces. However, these superficial signs of good omen cannot conceal the fact that "certain influential political groups in the West, while accepting the idea of top-level talks, have begun (or rather, are continuing) to secretly undermine the upcoming talks, striving to make them fruitless or even break them down."

The article said that the Paris meeting of Western heads of government and NATO member states reflected two tendencies. On the one hand, it passed and seemed to unanimously agree to hold a top-level meeting, while on the other hand, it made concessions to those who were unwilling for this meeting to succeed. These contradictions were so obvious that even some participants in the Paris meeting were confused.

U.S. and British representatives said that they would consider the Khrushchev-Eisenhower talks at Camp David and the Geneva talks when preparing for the top-level meeting, but Adenauer portrayed things in a completely different way. He affirmed that he had received a firm promise from his Western partners not to negotiate on the Berlin issue. At the same time, the West German group is spreading the message that it wants to revive the corpse of the so-called "package plan."

The article said that those who oppose easing international tensions have begun to actively mobilize their forces and means. They have found their soil in NATO. Participants in the NATO Council in Paris could not completely close their eyes to the new things happening in the world. They also talked about the improved international situation and even swore allegiance to the idea of disarmament. However, immediately following this, the U.S. leaders of NATO demanded new armaments, reinforcements, and accelerated construction of new U.S. missile bases on the territories of NATO member states.

The article concluded that such practices are clearly contradictory to the main tendency of the current international life, which is developing towards health.

Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: Sydney Dispatch: The Australian Communist Party's organ, the "Forum" Weekly, commented on the fact that the West was finally forced to propose a date for the East-West top-level meeting under the pressure of world public opinion, saying that striving for world peace remains the task before the people of the world. The newspaper pointed out that the West still refuses to agree to the universal demand for ending the Cold War. Therefore, the situation still contains dangers.

The newspaper said that NATO is holding exercises, West Germany is rearming with nuclear weapons, France is preparing to conduct nuclear tests, and behind all this is the revival of the U.S. "hard-line" policy advocated by Nelson Rockefeller and Nixon.

　　苏联“消息报”发表评论指出
    西方某些集团正暗中破坏最高级会谈
    澳“论坛”周报揭露西方国家顽固坚持“冷战”
    新华社莫斯科25日电　“消息报”今天发表题为“两种趋向”的文章说，有德意志联邦共和国总理参加的美英法政府首脑向苏联建议4月27日在巴黎举行最高级会谈，这是爱好和平力量的巨大成果，这一成果是长期努力的结果。现在即使是最狂热的“冷战”拥护者已不可能公开露头角了，但这些表面的良好征候不能掩盖住这一事实，即“西方某些有影响的政治集团在接受最高级会谈思想的同时开始了（更确切些——还在继续）暗中破坏即将举行的会谈，竭力使会谈陷于毫无成果甚至破裂。”
    文章说西方政府首脑和北大西洋公约组织参加国的巴黎会议反映出了两种趋向，一方面是通过了而且似乎是大家一致赞成举行最高级会议，而另一方面又对那些不愿意这一会议取得成就的人作了让步，这些矛盾是那么明显，甚至使得巴黎会议的某些参加者感到困惑。
    美英代表人物说他们在准备最高级会议时将考虑赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔在戴维营的会谈和日内瓦会谈，但阿登纳完全把事情描绘成另外一会事，他肯定说他已从西方伙伴那里获得了对柏林问题不作任何谈判的坚决允诺。同时西德集团正在散播消息说要使所谓“一揽子计划”的尸体复活。
    文章说，反对缓和国际紧张局势的人已开始积极动员自己的力量和手段，他们在北大西洋公约组织找到了自己的土壤，在巴黎的北大西洋公约组织理事会参加者不能完全闭起眼睛不看世界上所产生的新的东西，他们也谈了已有改善的国际形势，甚至发誓赌咒地要忠于裁军思想，但是紧跟着这些却是北大西洋公约组织的美国领导人要求新的武装、补充军队、加速在北大西洋公约组织参加国的领土上建设新的美国导弹基地。
    文章最后说，这种作法都是同正在向健康方面发展的当前国际生活的主要趋向显然矛盾的。
    新华社24日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党机关报“论坛”周报评论西方在世界舆论压力下终于被迫提出举行东西方最高级会议的日期这件事时说，争取世界和平仍然是摆在世界人民面前的任务。这家报纸指出，西方目前仍然拒绝答应关于停止冷战的普遍要求，因此，局势仍旧包含着危险。
    这家报纸说，北大西洋公约组织举行演习，西德用核武器重新武装，法国准备进行核试验，而在这一切背后的是纳尔逊·洛克菲勒和尼克松所鼓吹的美国“强硬”政策的复活。
