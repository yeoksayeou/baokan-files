Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 18th—Fuqing County, Fujian Province, which has a large number of dependents of returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, has properly settled the production and lives of more than 4,900 returned overseas Chinese since liberation.

Returned overseas Chinese with technical expertise and a certain level of education were quickly assigned jobs by relevant departments based on their personal wishes and the needs of national construction. For example, Wang Liangzhong, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia with car driving skills, was assigned to the Haikou Overseas Chinese Farm as a tractor driver; Yu Zhaofu, an old returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia with rich experience in growing tropical and subtropical crops, was assigned as the director of the Limei Overseas Chinese Orchard; He Xiushui, who used to run a small shop in Indonesia, is now the director of the sales department of the Chengguan Department Store; Lin Shiying, Zheng Shiqiao, Chen Meixiu, and others, who used to be teachers at overseas Chinese schools in Indonesia, have all been assigned as teachers at overseas Chinese middle schools.

For returned overseas Chinese who do not have technical expertise but have a certain ability to work, the overseas Chinese affairs departments have assigned them to the Fuqing Oil Factory, Sugar Factory, and people's communes invested in by overseas Chinese according to the needs of various parties, so they can participate in production.

The lives of returned overseas Chinese who have returned to China for retirement and housewives with many children are also taken care of by relevant departments.

Many returned overseas Chinese in various work positions have now become advanced workers and model laborers. Among the model figures in steel and grain production selected throughout the county in 1958, there were 463 returned overseas Chinese and dependents of overseas Chinese. Liu Cunqing, director of the Yuxi Pig Farm and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, has been repeatedly named a provincial and county labor model. The pig farm he leads was also named an advanced unit by the province and county last year. Tractor driver Wang Liangzhong was awarded the honorary title of advanced worker this year.

The political status of returned overseas Chinese is also valued. More than 20 returned overseas Chinese in the county have been elected as county people's representatives, three returned overseas Chinese serve as members of the county people's committee, and another nine serve as members of the county CPPCC. Gao Zhirong, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, also serves as the deputy county magistrate and vice chairman of the Fuqing County CPPCC.

    有专长的得到适当工作　有劳力的参加生产劳动
    福清五千归侨得到妥善安置
    新华社福州18日电　印度尼西亚华侨眷属众多的福建省福清县，解放以来妥善安置了四千九百多名归侨的生产和生活。
    有技术专长和有一定文化水平的归侨，有关部门根据他们个人的志愿和国家建设的需要，迅速安排了他们的工作。如印度尼西亚归侨王良忠有驾驶汽车技术，就被安置在海口华侨农场当拖拉机手，印度尼西亚老归侨俞兆复对种植热带和亚热带作物有丰富的经验，被安置担任里美华侨果林场场长；曾在印度尼西亚经营小商店的何修水，现在当上了城关百货商店门市部主任；曾在印度尼西亚华侨学校担任教员的林时英、郑式侨、陈枚秀等，都被安排在华侨中学担任教师。
    对于没有技术专长，但有一定劳动能力的归侨，侨务部门根据各方面需要，分别安置他们到华侨投资的福清油厂、糖厂和人民公社参加生产。
    归侨中有回国养老和多子女的家庭妇女，他们的生活，也得到有关部门的照顾。
    在各个工作岗位上的归侨，有许多现在已成为先进工作者和劳动模范。1958年全县选出的钢铁和粮食生产方面的模范人物中，归侨、侨眷就有四百六十三人。渔溪养猪场场长、印度尼西亚归侨刘存庆，曾多次被评为省和县的劳动模范，他所领导的养猪场去年也被评为省和县的先进单位。拖拉机手王良忠，今年获得了先进工作者的光荣称号。
    归侨的政治地位也同样受到重视。全县有二十多名归侨当选为县人民代表，有三名归侨担任县人民委员会委员，另外还有九人担任县政协委员。印度尼西亚归侨高至荣还担任福清县副县长和县政协副主席。
