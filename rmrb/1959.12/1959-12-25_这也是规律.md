This is Also a Law
　　Zhang Pei
　　The revolutionary train is running tirelessly. It is advancing towards a great goal—communism, one stage after another. Sometimes it travels in treacherous mountains and winding ridges, having to pass through large slopes, and it seems to move slower and more difficultly, but it is advancing. Sometimes it speeds across vast plains, leaving all forces that attempt to hinder its progress far behind.

　　For a true revolutionary with unwavering determination, no matter what the circumstances, he will firmly stand his ground and will not leave the great revolutionary train. However, on the road of struggle, there are always some people who travel with us for a period of time, long or short, and then fall off the train.

　　Right-leaning opportunists are the ones who fall off the revolutionary train. Of course, some of them may regain their senses after a painful fall and want to climb back onto the train, reform themselves, and advance with us again. If this is the case, it is a very good thing, and every comrade should warmly extend their hands and give them a good pull.

　　Why do some people fall off the revolutionary train? Is this an accidental misstep? Is it an abnormal phenomenon without规律? No. This is also a规律. This is a reflection of class struggle in society within our party, a reflection of the laws of class struggle. Engels pointed out long ago: "The movement of the proletariat necessarily goes through various stages of development, and at each stage, some people stop and do not move forward" ("To August Bebel").

　　From this struggle against right-leaning tendencies, as well as from the history of our party's long revolutionary struggle, we have seen this objective inevitability: whenever the revolution develops to an important juncture, whenever the revolution takes a step further, a few vacillating right-leaning opportunists within the party stand up to oppose the correct leadership of the party, oppose the correct line of the party, and even become enemies of the revolution, such as Chen Duxiu, Zhang Guotao, and others.

　　Why do right-leaning opportunists rise up against the party's leadership and line precisely when the revolution is developing in depth? This is because the more the revolution develops in depth, the more the transformation of the relations of production moves in a more thorough direction, and the more intense the ideological changes and conflicts of various classes in society become. This situation inevitably reflects in the party. A section of people within the party who have a bourgeois worldview and have not consciously undergone transformation for a long time, feel more and more that the proletarian worldview and the party's correct line are incompatible with their bourgeois worldview and right-leaning opportunist line. Therefore, they reveal their true colors and embark on the road of resisting socialism.

　　Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," "Those who join our party not only come from all strata of society, but also come with all kinds of different purposes and motives." Many people come to the Communist Party to find personal advancement. Before joining the party, they neither have a clear and definite communist outlook on life and the world, nor a firm proletarian stance, but most of them, after joining the party, have been tempered by the flames of long-term revolutionary struggle, have worked hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have abandoned various non-proletarian viewpoints, positions, and styles, and have gradually established a communist outlook on life and the world, becoming staunch proletarian fighters. Therefore, they will not lose their way in great storms and will firmly stand on the side of the party's correct line. Some of them may not be able to see clearly on individual issues for a while, but on the fundamental issues of right and wrong concerning the party's leadership and line, they are basically firm. However, there are still a few people who, after joining the party organizationally, have not joined the party ideologically for a long time. They have neither seriously studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, nor have they determined to temper themselves and transform themselves in actual struggle. Therefore, they stubbornly maintain their original worldview for a long time. It can be said that they all have serious bourgeois individualism and liberalism without exception. When the revolution develops deeper and deeper, the contradiction between the reality of the revolution and the reality of their thinking—the bourgeois worldview—becomes greater and greater. Therefore, under certain circumstances, they expose the face of hostile classes, represent the interests of hostile classes, and raise the banner of anti-party and anti-socialism.

　　In 1958 and 1959, China's socialist revolution had a deeper and more thorough development. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes meant that all roads leading to capitalism were blocked; the old roots of private ownership were about to be uprooted; the elements of communism began to sprout in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people; the revolutionary train was leaping forward, and the torrent of the mighty mass movement was washing away all decadent old things. All this could not but cause a violent shock in the political and ideological fields. Those who were nominally communists, but actually stubbornly maintained a bourgeois worldview—right-leaning opportunists—realized that their last position was about to be lost. Therefore, they frantically attacked the People's Communes, the Great Steel Smelting, and high speed, attacked the distribution system combining wage system and supply system, attacked communal dining halls, and attacked all great new things. They launched a desperate offensive, attempting to give the dying bourgeoisie another artificial respiration.

　　Some of them had, to a certain extent, approved of the party's minimum program, which showed that they still had a certain degree of enthusiasm for the democratic revolution, and therefore they passed the test of the democratic revolution. They also had a vague idea of socialism, but when the party thoroughly implemented the maximum program, this violated the bourgeois kingdom deep in their minds—the bourgeois program. Therefore, they became angry and opposed the party, failing to pass the test of socialism. There were also some people among them who did not completely approve of the party's minimum program and were not thorough democratic revolutionaries. They also passed the test of the democratic revolution shakily. Now that they are to realize the party's maximum program, they will of course stubbornly resist. No matter what kind of fellow travelers they are, the targets of their attacks are, without exception, the party's leadership and the party's General Line. They attempted to replace the party's correct leadership and correct line with right-leaning opportunist leadership and line; they wanted to defeat the proletarian worldview with the bourgeois worldview. What does this show? It shows that right-leaning opportunists were not true proletarian revolutionaries in the first place, and they did not want to carry out the revolution to the end. Some of them made revolution for a distance, some made revolution for two distances, and some made revolution for at most three distances, and then they could no longer make revolution.

　　Hasn't the socialist revolution been basically completed? Hasn't capitalist ownership of the means of production and individual ownership that can breed capitalist factors disappeared? Since the foundation that created class struggle has basically ceased to exist, why is class struggle still reflected within our party?

　　Our socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production was basically completed as early as 1956, but it has not been completely completed. Capitalist ownership still reflects its faint figure in some form (such as fixed interest). Our economic base is already basically a single socialist economic base. The foundation has been changed, but the superstructure—ideology—that reflects the old foundation has not disappeared with the disappearance of the old foundation. The ideology that reflects the old foundation still wanders like a ghost over the new foundation. What does this show? It shows that the flames of class struggle have not been extinguished. In 1957, we crushed the frantic attack of the bourgeois rightists and carried out a great socialist revolution in politics and ideology, and achieved a decisive victory. But it cannot be said that the bourgeois ideology has been swept away from everyone's minds. On the contrary, it takes a long time to overcome it completely. Under the situation of the rapid development of socialist construction, the attack of right-leaning opportunists reflects the bourgeoisie's resistance to the in-depth development of socialism. It can be seen that although the capitalist economic base has been basically destroyed, the bourgeois ideology is not willing to easily give up its position on the political and ideological front. The already decayed slogans of "liberty, equality, and fraternity" of the French bourgeoisie nearly two hundred years ago are still being praised by some right-leaning opportunists in China today. It can be seen that the struggle between the two roads in the political and ideological aspects will continue for a long time. The basic completion of the socialist revolution in the economic aspect has created good conditions for carrying out the socialist revolution in the political and ideological aspects; and the in-depth development of the socialist revolution in the political and ideological aspects has cleared the way for carrying out a more thorough socialist revolution in the economy. The role of the foundation and the counter-role of the superstructure are carried out interactively, constantly pushing our country's socialist revolution forward. It can be seen that in the process of socialist construction, the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, appearing repeatedly with highs and lows and intermittent interruptions, is precisely a reflection of the laws of class struggle in the transition period, which is not surprising at all.

　　In the spring and summer of this year, right-leaning opportunists took advantage of some individual, local, and temporary shortcomings in our work that have been quickly overcome and are being overcome, exaggerated them infinitely, and directed the spearhead of the attack at the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. In this respect, their actions are in step with the imperialist reactionaries. At that time, the reactionaries all over the world were slandering and cursing China's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. At this critical juncture, right-leaning opportunists echoed the attack of the imperialist reactionaries.

　　"Strong grass is known in a strong wind." The true situation is completely opposite to the estimates of the right-leaning opportunists. Because they possess an anti-dialectical materialist bourgeois worldview, and because they stand on a position hostile to the party, they often have an instinctive illusion about the situation. Originally, it was a beautiful day with sunshine, but they shouted loudly that a storm was coming; when hundreds of millions of people were making great strides with full enthusiasm, they sighed and kept beating the retreat, as if disaster was imminent. The purpose of their doing so is to accuse the party's line of being wrong, and to prove that their line—the right-leaning opportunist line—is correct. The sinister wind of right-leaning was quickly dispelled by the party's noble spirit. For us, 1959 is a year as glorious as 1958. However, this also shows that even in a very good revolutionary situation, some right-leaning opportunists who are labeled as communists but are actually bourgeois revolutionaries will also use the individual, local, and temporary shortcomings in our work to deny the great achievements of socialist construction, attack the party's correct leadership, and open the way for capitalist restoration. This is also a规律.

　　Since the anti-right-leaning struggle is a reflection of class struggle within our party, then it is inevitable to launch this struggle, and it is also inevitable that some people will fall off the revolutionary train. The view that the flames of class struggle would be extinguished after the basic completion of the socialist revolution has been proven to be completely incorrect by practice. The anti-right-leaning struggle is an excellent class education for us. Through this anti-right-leaning struggle, our class consciousness will be further enhanced, we will raise the banner of the General Line higher, we will better study Mao Zedong Thought, our ranks will be more united and stronger, we will be able to better overcome all the difficulties on the road of advancement, and we will build our motherland into a great socialist power at high speed.

### 这也是规律

　　这也是规律
　　张沛
    革命的列车永不停息地奔驰着。它一程又一程地朝着一个伟大目标——共产主义前进。它有时行进在险恶的丛山、曲折的峻岭，要通过很大的坡度，看起来，它走得缓慢些、艰难些，但它在前进。它有时在辽阔的平原上风驰电掣，把一切企图阻挡它前进的力量，远远地抛在后面。
    对于一个矢志不渝的真正的革命者来说，不管在什么情况下，他都是稳稳地坚守在自己的位置上，都不会离开伟大的革命列车。可是，在斗争的道路上总有那样一些人，他们或长或短地和我们同了一段路，然后从列车上掉下去了。
    右倾机会主义分子，就是从革命列车上掉下去的人。当然他们中间有些人，可能在摔得很痛以后，神智反而清醒了，还想爬到列车上来，洗心革面重新和我们一同前进。果真这样，这是很好的事情，每个同志都应当热情地伸开双手，好好地拉他们一把。
    为什么有人会从革命的列车上掉下去？这是一种偶然的失足吗？是一种没有规律的反常现象吗？不。这也是规律。这是阶级斗争的社会现象在我们党内的反映，是阶级斗争的规律的反映。恩格斯早就指出过：“无产阶级的运动，必然要经过各种发展阶段，在每一个阶段上都有一部分人停留下来，不再前进”（“致奥·倍倍尔”）
    从这次的反右倾的斗争中，以及从我们党的漫长的革命斗争的历史中，我们看到了这种客观必然性：每当革命发展到一个重要关头，每当革命深入一步，党内少数动摇成性的右倾机会主义分子，就起来反对党的正确领导、反对党的正确路线，甚至成为革命的敌人，如陈独秀、张国焘等就是这种人。
    右倾机会主义分子为什么会恰恰在革命深入发展的时候，起来反对党的领导和路线呢？这是因为革命越向深入发展，生产关系的变革向更彻底的方向转化，社会上各阶级的思想变化及其冲突就会激烈起来。这种情况必然反映到党内来。党内一部分有资产阶级世界观而长期没有自觉地经过改造的人，这时就越感到无产阶级的世界观、党的正确路线和他们的资产阶级世界观和右倾机会主义的路线格格不入，于是他们原形毕露，走上反抗社会主义的道路。
    刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”中说，“加入我们党的人，不只是来自社会上的各阶层，而且是带着各种各色不同的目的与动机而来的。”许多人是为了到共产党中来找个人的出路。他们在入党以前，既没有清楚而确定的共产主义的人生观和世界观，也没有坚定的无产阶级立场，但他们中间的大多数人，在入党以后，经过了长期革命斗争的烈火的冶炼，努力学习了马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，抛弃了各种非无产阶级的观点、立场和作风，逐步地树立了共产主义的人生观和世界观，成为一个坚定的无产阶级的战士，因而在大风浪中他们不会迷失方向，坚决地站在党的正确路线方面。他们中间有些人在个别问题上也可能一时看不清楚，但在对党的领导、路线这些根本性的大是大非的问题上，他们基本上是坚定的。然而也还有少数人，他们在组织上入党以后，思想上却长期没有入党。他们既没有认真地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，又没有下决心在实际斗争中锻炼自己，改造自己，因而长期地顽强地保持着他们原有的世界观，可以说，他们无例外地都具有严重的资产阶级个人主义、自由主义。当革命发展一步比一步深入的时候，革命的实际和他们思想的实际——资产阶级世界观的抵触越来越大，因而在一定的气候下，他们就暴露出敌对阶级的面貌，代表敌对阶级的利益，举起反党反社会主义的旗子。
    1958年和1959年我国的社会主义革命有了更深入更彻底的发展，总路线、大跃进、人民公社化，意味着通向资本主义的一切道路都被堵塞了；私有制的老根就要被连根拔除了；共产主义的因素开始在亿万人民的心坎上萌芽了；革命的列车在飞跃前进，浩荡的群众运动的激流，冲刷着一切陈腐的旧事物。这一切不能不在政治思想领域内造成一种剧烈震动。那些名义上是共产党员，而实际上顽强地保持着资产阶级世界观的同路人——右倾机会主义分子，这时发现他们最后的阵地就要丧失了，于是他们疯狂地攻击人民公社、大炼钢铁和高速度、攻击工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度、攻击食堂化、攻击一切伟大的新生事物。他们发起了一种绝望的进攻，企图为灭亡中的资产阶级再进行一次人工呼吸。
    他们中间的一些人，曾经在一定程度上赞成过党的最低纲领，这表明他们还有一定程度的民主革命的积极性，因而他们通过了民主革命这一关。他们也有一种朦朦胧胧要社会主义的思想，可是当党彻底履行最高纲领的时候，这就触犯了他们思想深处的资产阶级王国——资产阶级的纲领，于是他们动怒并且起来反对党了，社会主义这一关过不去了。他们中间还有些人，对党的最低纲领也不是完全赞成的，还够不上一个彻底的民主革命者，他们过民主革命这一关的时候，也是摇摇晃晃混过来的，现在要实现党的最高纲领，他们当然就要负隅顽抗。无论哪一种色彩的同路人，他们攻击的目标，无例外的都是党的领导和党的总路线。他们企图用右倾机会主义的领导和路线，来代替党的正确领导和正确路线；想用资产阶级的世界观来战胜无产阶级的世界观。这说明了什么呢？说明了右倾机会主义分子本来就不是真正的无产阶级革命家，本来就不是想革命革到底的人。他们有的革了一段路，有的革了两段路，有的至多革了三段路，就再也革不下去了。
    社会主义革命不是基本完成了吗？生产资料方面的资本主义所有制和能够孕育资本主义因素的个体所有制不是已经消失了吗？既然造成阶级斗争的基础已经基本不存在了，为什么阶级斗争仍然在我们党内得到反映呢？
    我们的生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命，早在1956年就基本完成了，但是还并未彻底完成，资本主义所有制还以某种形态（如定息）反射出它的微弱的身影。我们的经济基础已经基本上是一个单一的社会主义的经济基础，基础是改变了，可是反映旧基础的上层建筑——意识形态，并没有随着旧基础的消失而消失。反映旧基础的意识形态仍然像游魂一样飘荡在新基础的上空。这说明了什么呢？说明了阶级斗争的火焰，并没有就此熄灭。1957年，我们粉碎了资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，在政治上思想上进行了一场伟大的社会主义革命，并且取得了决定性的胜利。但是不能说资产阶级的观念形态已经从所有人的头脑中一扫而光了，相反，需要很长的时间才能得到彻底克服。在社会主义建设一日千里发展的形势下，右倾机会主义分子的进攻反映了资产阶级对社会主义深入发展的反抗。由此可见，资本主义的经济基础虽然基本上已被摧毁了，但是，资产阶级的意识形态，还不肯在政治思想战线上轻易让出阵地。早已腐朽了的差不多两百年以前法国资产阶级的“自由、平等、博爱”的口号，不是仍被今日中国的一些右倾机会主义分子所颂扬吗？可见政治思想方面两条道路的斗争，还会继续一个长时期。经济方面的社会主义革命的基本完成，为在政治、思想方面进行社会主义革命创造了良好条件；而政治、思想方面社会主义革命的深入，又为经济上进行更彻底的社会主义革命扫清道路。基础的作用和上层建筑的反作用交互进行着，把我国的社会主义革命不断向前推进。由此可见，在社会主义建设过程中，无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的斗争，高一阵低一阵时断时续地反复出现，正是过渡时期阶级斗争规律的反映，是一点也不奇怪的。
    右倾机会主义分子在今年春夏之交，利用我们工作中一些已经迅速克服了和正在克服中的个别的、局部的、暂时的缺点，将其无限夸大，把进攻的矛头针对着总路线、大跃进、人民公社。在这一点上，他们的行动和帝国主义反动派是步伐一致的，就在那个时候，全世界的反动分子，都在污蔑、咒骂我国的总路线、大跃进、人民公社。在这个紧要关头，右倾机会主义分子唱和了帝国主义反动派的进攻。
    “疾风知劲草”，真正的形势和右倾机会主义分子的估计完全相反，由于他们拥有的是反辩证唯物主义的资产阶级世界观，由于他们站在和党相敌对的立场上，所以他们常常对形势产生一种本能的错觉。本来是阳光普照的丽人天，他们却大声喧嚷风雨欲来了；当亿万人民干劲十足继续跃进的时候，他们却唉声叹气不停地敲起退堂鼓，似乎灾难临头了。他们这样做的目的，在于指责党的路线错了，在于证明他们的路线——右倾机会主义的路线是正确的。右倾的阴风，被党的浩然正气迅速击散了，对我们来说，1959年是一个和1958年同样光辉灿烂的年度。然而，这也表明：即便在革命形势十分良好的情况下，一些挂着共产主义者的牌子而实际上是资产阶级革命家的右倾机会主义分子，也会利用我们工作中的个别的、局部的、暂时的缺点，来否定社会主义建设的巨大成就，攻击党的正确领导，为资本主义复辟打通道路。这也是一种规律。
    既然反右倾斗争是阶级斗争在我们党内的反映，那末展开这场斗争就是必不可免的，而一些人从革命的列车上摔下去也是不可避免的。以为在社会主义革命基本完成以后，阶级斗争的火焰就从此熄灭了的看法，被实际证明是完全不正确的。反右倾斗争对于我们是一次极好的阶级教育，经过这次反右倾斗争，一定会进一步提高我们的阶级觉悟，更高地举起总路线的旗帜，更好地学习毛泽东思想，我们的队伍将更加团结强大，能更好地战胜前进道路上的一切困难，高速度地把我们的祖国建设成一个伟大的社会主义强国。
