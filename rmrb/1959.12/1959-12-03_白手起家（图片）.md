    This is a set of paintings depicting the process of four workers at the Benxi Alloy Factory in Liaoning Province building the factory from scratch. The complete set consists of fourteen paintings, created by students of the High School Affiliated to the Luxun Academy of Fine Arts. Only five of them are published here.
    (1) When the Benxi Alloy Factory was first established, there were only four demobilized soldiers. They didn't understand the technology and had no factory buildings, raw materials, or tools. But they were not discouraged. They went everywhere and borrowed a spoon, two pots, and three molds from Shenyang. This is the so-called "Starting from scratch with one, two, three, four."
    (2) The factory grew from nothing to something, from small to large. Through countless storms and rains. However, no one wavered, no one retreated. They brought into play the collective wisdom and strength, and overcame all kinds of difficulties.
    (3) "Stars rely on the sunlight, the masses rely on the Communist Party." The Party has always supported and encouraged these daring people. When they encountered difficulties, leading comrades were always with them to study the problems, and also sent technicians to help them.
    (4) "Nothing is impossible to a willing heart." After repeated research and experiments, the alloy was finally smelted. The victory encouraged all the staff, and they were determined to continue to improve their technology and produce more high-quality alloy steel for the country.
    (5) The Party's General Line put them on the steed of the Great Leap Forward. They built the factory and produced at the same time, displaying soaring enthusiasm. Production doubled, and the variety of products reached more than 300.

    这是一套描绘辽宁省本溪市合金厂四个工人空手建厂经过的组画，全套共十四幅，是鲁迅美术学院附中学生创作的。这里发表的只是其中的五幅。
    （一）本溪市合金厂建厂时只有四个复员军人，不懂技术也没有厂房、原料和工具。但是他们没有气馁，四处奔走从沈阳借来一把勺子、两口锅、三个模子，这就是所谓“一二三四起家”
    （二）厂子从无到有，从小到大，风呀雨呀，也不知经历了多多少少。但是，谁也没有动摇，谁也没有后退，发挥集体的智慧和力量，战胜了种种困难。
    （三）“星星靠的太阳光，群众靠的共产党。”党一直支持和鼓励这几个敢想敢说敢干的人，遇到困难，领导同志总是同他们在一起研究，还派技术人员帮助他们。
    （四）“天下无难事，只怕有心人。”经过反复研究和试验，合金终于炼出来了，胜利鼓舞了全厂人员，他们下决心继续提高技术，为国家生产出更多的优质合金钢。
    （五）党的总路线使他们跨上了大跃进的骏马，他们边建厂，边生产，发挥了冲天的干劲，生产翻了一番，产品的种类达到三百余种。
