　　Rhapsody of Hainan Island
　　Ji Peng
　　
　　Arriving at Tongza at night, car after car flies down the mountain road, headlights shining like bright pearls, glittering streams, dark green old forests, hello, Tongza, a city full of lights. Streetlights reflect the smiling faces of pedestrians, bangles jingle, colorful skirts are like flowers, pineapples smell fragrant, laughter echoes in the theater, couples stroll under the lychee trees. The hazy moonlight embraces the mountain city, Tongza, you are a poem, a painting, but the guide quietly tells me that before liberation, there were only a few Li and Miao families here.

　　I walk on the Nandu River Bridge, white waves soaring, trees sailing on the water, homes washed empty, people as thin as dried wood, bandit soldiers grabbing recruits and looting, leather boots kicking, whips lashing...

　　I walk on the Nandu River Bridge,
　　Remembering those times of hardship. Riding bamboo rafts to cross the river at night, raising knives and guns to attack enemy pillboxes, battle cries louder than the river's roar, anger burning high to avenge blood feuds.

　　I walk on the Nandu River Bridge,
　　Unforgettable is that battle before dawn. Red flags shining red on the river, celebrating victory with coconut wine, rebuilding the homeland on the wasteland, planting rice and building dikes, soldiers and civilians hand in hand.

　　I walk on the Nandu River Bridge,
　　Forever remembering that time of victory. Rice paddies golden, fishermen's songs endless on the river, the scenery on both banks like brocade, songs and dances celebrating the harvest.

　　I walk on the Nandu River Bridge,
　　Praising the happiness and freedom here. So many reflections and prospects, so much joy and hard fighting, sunshine after the storm, the trust of the motherland on our shoulders.

　　I walk on the Nandu River Bridge,
　　During that arduous patrol.

    海南岛散歌
    纪鹏
    夜抵通杂辆辆汽车沿着山路飞下，车灯宛如明珠闪着光华，亮晶的流泉，墨绿的老林，你好呵，满城灯火的通杂。街灯映着行人的笑脸，手镯轻响，彩裙如花，菠萝喷香，剧院里笑语喧哗，对对情侣漫步在荔枝树下。朦胧月色拥抱着山城，通杂，你是一首诗，一幅画，可是向导悄悄地告诉我，解放前，这里只有黎苗几家。
  我在南渡江桥上行走白浪滔天，树上行舟，水洗家空，人如枯柴瘦，匪军抓丁又抢掠，皮靴踢，鞭子抽……
    我在南渡江桥上行走，
    忆起那苦难重重的时候。乘着椰筏夜渡江，高举刀枪攻打敌炮楼，杀声胜过江涛响，怒火高燃报血仇。
    我在南渡江桥上行走，
    难忘那黎明前的战斗。红旗辉映江水红，欢度胜利饮椰酒，荒原重建新家园，插秧、筑堤军民手携手。
    我在南渡江桥上行走，
    永记那胜利的时候。稻田一片金黄，江上渔歌不住口，两岸风光如锦绣，歌舞喧天庆丰收。
    我在南渡江桥上行走，
    赞美这里的幸福自由。多少回想与展望，多少欢乐和艰苦的战斗，风雨过后艳阳天，祖国的信任担肩头。
    我在南渡江桥上行走，
    在那严峻的巡逻时候。
