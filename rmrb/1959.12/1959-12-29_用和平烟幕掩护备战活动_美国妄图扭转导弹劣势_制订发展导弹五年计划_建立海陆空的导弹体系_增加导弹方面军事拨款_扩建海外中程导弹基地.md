　　Using a Peace Smoke Screen to Cover Up War Preparations
    The United States Vainly Attempts to Reverse its Missile Inferiority
    Formulate a Five-Year Missile Development Plan; Establish a Sea, Land, and Air Missile System; Increase Military Appropriations for Missiles; Expand Overseas Intermediate-Range Missile Bases
　　Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: A series of facts recently revealed by American officials and newspapers show that while paying lip service to "peace," the American ruling clique is frantically pushing forward its new five-year (1959-1963) plan to develop military strength. The core of this plan is to concentrate efforts on developing advanced strategic offensive weapons—long-range missiles—as the main force of "nuclear deterrence," while also not relaxing preparations for "local wars." The American ruling clique is buying time to implement this plan in order to change its current inferior position in military strength. The actual actions of the American ruling clique in actively preparing for nuclear war fully demonstrate the falsity of its proclaimed "desire for peace."
    U.S. President Eisenhower's remarks at a recent press conference prove that the United States is in the process of shifting the main basis of nuclear attack from the Strategic Air Command (long-range bombers) to missiles. He said that the United States "is now transitioning from one defense system to another, especially on the issue of deterrence." At another press conference, Eisenhower also pointed out that in the current U.S. "defense" and military scientific research, missiles and outer space tools "hold the highest priority." A research report issued by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on December 5 called for the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles with "maximum effort" and the establishment of fixed missile launch sites on land and mobile ground, air, and sea missile systems with "maximum effort" to buy time to shorten the "missile gap."
    According to American newspapers, the U.S. Department of Defense intends to vigorously develop "Atlas," "Titan," and "Minuteman" intercontinental ballistic missiles, "Polaris" intermediate-range missiles launched from submarines, and intermediate-range missiles launched from aircraft during the period from now to 1963, so that the U.S. military can be equipped with a large number of intercontinental missiles and other modern missiles by 1963.
    According to a November report in "Fortune" magazine, the U.S. government plans to build nine "Atlas" intercontinental missile squadrons, eleven "Titan" intercontinental missile squadrons, and one "Minuteman" intercontinental missile squadron (each squadron equipped with ten missiles) by 1963, as well as forty nuclear submarines carrying "Polaris" intermediate-range missiles. Since the "Atlas" missile has only been successfully tested "in a symbolic sense," and the "Minuteman," "Titan," and "Polaris" missiles are still in the research and testing stage, the current U.S. nuclear attack force will still mainly rely on the Strategic Air Command, aircraft carriers, and some intermediate-range missiles based on overseas bases.
    In order to concentrate financial resources on the development of missile weapons, the U.S. government is adjusting its military budget to make it more focused. According to American newspapers, the U.S. is expected to spend $7 billion on missiles in the 1960 fiscal year, which began on July 1 this year. Even the official figure of $4 billion is more than ten times the $300 million spent in 1953. According to American newspapers, in the 1961 fiscal year, which begins on July 1 next year, the U.S. government, regardless of the severe financial crisis, will still maintain direct military spending at the huge figure of $41 billion, while spending on missiles is expected to increase to $8 billion, an increase of $1 billion over this year. According to "Business Week" on October 31, spending on space programs will also increase from $800 million in this fiscal year to $1.3 billion.
    In order to concentrate financial resources on the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the United States is cutting military spending in other areas and making some adjustments in its strategic deployment. In this regard, a notable feature is that although the U.S. government is vigorously developing new weapons under the guise of strengthening "defense," it is cutting spending on tactical defensive weapons and developing offensive strategic weapons. The U.S. government recently cut its plans to manufacture "Bomarc" and "Nike-Hercules" air defense missiles. Baldwin, a well-known military commentator for "The New York Times," admitted in his commentary that this reduction reflects the opinion of some Americans who believe that spending too much money on air defense is "futile," and that the best way today is "only one—attack." Baldwin called this "the United States' revision of its defense policy, replacing defense with attack." The United States is also preparing to reduce or stop the production of certain short-range missiles and other tactical missiles, encouraging its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies (primarily West Germany) and Japan to produce these missiles so that the United States can free up its hands to develop offensive long-range missiles.
    Some conventional weapons and conventional forces that have gradually become obsolete are also being prepared for some reductions. The U.S. Air Force has announced that it will reduce production of B-58 jet bombers in the next fiscal year. Earlier this month, it also announced that it would retire 900 aircraft to save costs. On the 22nd of this month, the U.S. Navy also announced that 22 older warships would be retired from service. According to "U.S. News & World Report," the U.S. government has also decided to reduce the number of naval and air force troops by about 30,000 next year, the second nuclear-powered aircraft carrier will cease production, and air force squadrons will be reduced by ten to twenty.
    Similarly, in order to accelerate the development of missiles and outer space tools, the U.S. government has re-assigned some responsibilities to the three armed services and other relevant departments. "Business Week" reported that according to the U.S. government's plan, the U.S. Air Force will be responsible for the research and production of intercontinental missiles, intermediate-range missiles, early warning satellites, reconnaissance satellites, etc.; the Navy will be responsible for the research and production of "Polaris" intermediate-range missiles launched from submarines and navigation satellites; the Army will be responsible for the research and production of "Nike-Zeus" anti-missile missiles and communication satellites, etc.; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will be responsible for outer space exploration and the launch of certain military-related satellites. However, the magazine admitted that most of the above missiles and satellites are in the early stages of research or testing.
    While concentrating on the development of missiles and outer space tools, the U.S. government is not relaxing its preparations for so-called "local wars." Former Secretary of Defense McElroy clamored before resigning that he would devote himself to developing weapons used "in non-nuclear limited wars." The Army is also doing its best to advocate that it must have sufficient capabilities to carry out military operations like the armed intervention in Lebanon and the possible armed intervention in Laos. Under the guidance of this strategic thinking, the U.S. government has now decided not to reduce the number of army troops next year, a regular aircraft carrier will be built, and the tactical air force needs to strengthen its so-called non-nuclear strike force.
    In terms of overseas bases, the United States is also redeploying them in accordance with its new strategic plan. Feeling that intercontinental missiles are lagging behind and have too short a range, the United States is stepping up the establishment of intermediate-range missile bases around socialist camp countries and is urging its allies to establish troops equipped with intermediate-range or short-range missiles. In addition to establishing seven intermediate-range missile bases with a range of 1,500 miles in the already agreed-upon Britain, Italy, and Turkey, it is also forcing Western European countries such as Greece, France, and Denmark to agree to establish such bases. Among the ten Western European North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, the United States has established 30 battalions equipped with short-range and tactical missiles this year, and plans to establish 100 missile battalions by 1963. In the Far East, it is also stepping up the establishment and expansion of missile bases in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Okinawa. On the other hand, some adjustments are being made to some overseas bases that are gradually losing their effectiveness in order to reduce the pressure of overseas military spending. For example, the U.S. government announced earlier this month that it would withdraw about 1,200 army personnel from Iceland, but still retain naval and air force bases. Prior to this, the U.S. government reached an agreement with the Philippine government to return thirteen bases to the Philippines and conditionally return another four, but still retain the right to use these bases in wartime. As for the four major U.S. military bases in the Philippines, they remain retained. According to the joint communiqué issued by Eisenhower and the King of Morocco on the 22nd, the United States will withdraw its bases in Morocco in 1963, that is, when its five-year plan to develop military strength is completed. There are reports that the role of the U.S. bases in Morocco will be replaced by missile and air force bases in Spain and Turkey and elsewhere. American newspapers admit that these adjustments do not harm the United States' global strategic deployment in the slightest.

　　用和平烟幕掩护备战活动
    美国妄图扭转导弹劣势
    制订发展导弹五年计划  建立海陆空的导弹体系  增加导弹方面军事拨款  扩建海外中程导弹基地
　　新华社28日讯　美国官方和报刊最近透露的一系列事实说明，美国统治集团在侈谈“和平”的同时，正在狂热地推行它发展军事力量的新五年（1959—1963）计划。这个计划的中心是集中力量着重发展战略进攻性的尖端武器——远程导弹，把它作为“核威慑”的主力，同时也不放松“局部战争”的准备。美国统治集团正在争取时间实现这个计划，以便改变它目前在军事力量上的劣势地位。美国统治集团这种积极准备核战争的实际行动，充分地说明了它所宣传的“和平愿望”的虚假性。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在最近一次记者招待会上的谈话，证明了美国在军事上正处在把核攻击的主要基础从战略空军（远程轰炸机）转移到导弹上去的调整过程中。他说，美国“现在正从一个防御体系转到另一个防御体系去，特别是在威慑力量这样一个问题上”。在另一个记者招待会上，艾森豪威尔还指出，在当前美国的“防务”和军事科学研究中，导弹和外层空间工具“占有最优先的地位”。美国参议院外交委员会12月5日发表的一个研究报告要求以“最大的努力”发展洲际导弹，并且以“最大的努力”来建立陆地上的固定的导弹发射场和机动的地面、空中和海上的导弹体系，以争取时间缩短“导弹方面相差的距离”。
    据美国报刊透露，美国国防部的打算是：在目前到1963年这个期间竭力发展“阿特拉斯式”、“大力神式”、“民兵式”洲际导弹，从潜艇上发射的“北极星式”中程导弹，以及从飞机上发射的中程导弹等，以便能在1963年以大量洲际导弹和其他现代化的导弹把美国军队装备起来。
    据11月份的“幸福”杂志报道，按照美国政府的计划，到1963年要建成九个“阿特拉斯式”洲际导弹中队，十一个“大力神式”洲际导弹中队，一个“民兵式”洲际导弹中队（每个中队装备导弹十枚），以及四十艘携带“北极星式”中程导弹的原子潜水艇。由于“阿特拉斯式”导弹只“在象征的意义上”试验成功，“民兵式”、“大力神式”、“北极星式”导弹，还只是在研究试验之中，目前美国的核攻击力量将仍然主要依靠战略空军、航空母舰和加上设在海外基地上的一些中程导弹。
    为了集中财力发展导弹武器，美国政府正在调整它的军事预算，使它重点更为突出。据美国报刊透露，在今年7月1日开始的1960财政年度中，美国预定用在导弹方面的开支达七十亿美元，即使是美国官方宣布的数字四十亿美元，也比1953年的三亿美元增加了十多倍。据美国报刊报道，在明年7月1日开始的1961财政年度里，美国政府不顾严重的财政危机，将仍把直接军费维持在四百一十亿美元的庞大数字上，而用在导弹方面的经费预定要增加到八十亿美元，比今年再增加十亿美元。据“商业周刊”10月31日报道，用于空间计划的经费也将由本财政年度的八亿美元增加到十三亿美元。
    为了集中财力发展洲际导弹，美国正在削减其他方面的军事费用，并在战略部署上作了一些调整。在这一方面，一个显著的特点是：尽管美国政府大力发展新式武器是在所谓加强“防御”这个幌子下进行的，但是它却在削减用于战术防御性武器方面的费用，而发展进攻性战略武器。美国政府不久前削减了制造“鲍马克式”和“奈克—赫尔克里士式”防空导弹的计划。“纽约时报”著名军事评论员鲍德温在评论中承认，这方面的削减反映了美国某些人的意见，他们认为把太多的钱花在防空方面“于事无补”，今天的最好办法“只有一个——进攻”。鲍德温把这一点称为“美国修改国防政策，以攻击代替防御”。美国还准备削减或停止生产某些短程导弹和其他战术性导弹，鼓励它的北大西洋集团盟国（首先是西德）以及日本来生产这些导弹，以便让美国腾出手来发展进攻性的远程导弹。
    对某些已经逐渐过时的常规武器以及常规部队也准备作一些削减。美国空军曾宣布，下一财政年度将削减B—五八型喷气轰炸机的生产。本月初又宣布将使九百架飞机退役，以节省开支。本月22日美国海军也宣布二十二只较旧的军舰退出现役。据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说，美国政府还决定在明年把海军和空军部队削减约三万人，第二艘用核能发动的航空母舰将停止制造，空军联队减少十个到二十个。
    同样，为了加速发展导弹和外层空间工具，美国政府对三军和其他有关部门重新作了一些分工。“商业周刊”报道说，按照美国政府的计划，美国空军将负责洲际导弹、中程导弹、早期警报卫星、侦察卫星等研究和生产工作，海军将负责由潜艇发射的“北极星式”中程导弹和导航卫星的研究和生产工作，陆军将负责“奈克—宙斯式”反导弹导弹和通讯卫星等研究和生产工作，全国星际和空间航行局将负责外层空间探索和某些同军事有关的人造卫星发射工作。但是，这家周刊承认，上述这一些导弹和卫星绝大部分都处在初期研究或试验阶段。
    在集中力量发展导弹和外层空间工具的同时，美国政府也不放松对进行所谓“局部战争”的准备。前国防部长麦克耳罗伊在辞职前就叫嚷要致力发展“在非核有限战争中”使用的武器。陆军方面也竭力鼓吹必须拥有充分能力，以进行像武装干涉黎巴嫩以及可能进行的武装干涉老挝的那样的军事行动。在这种战略思想的指导下，美国政府现在决定在明年不削减陆军部队人数，一艘普通的航空母舰将要建造，战术空军需加强所谓非核子攻击力量。
    在海外基地方面，美国也正在根据新的战略计划重新部署。由于感到洲际导弹落后，手太短了，因此，美国正加紧在社会主义阵营国家周围建立中程导弹基地，并且鞭策它的盟国建立配备中程或短程导弹的部队。除了在已经同意的英国、意大利和土耳其建立七个射程为一千五百英里的中程导弹基地以外，还正在逼迫希腊、法国、丹麦等西欧国家同意建立这种基地。在西欧十个北大西洋集团国家中，美国今年已建立了配备有短程和战术导弹的部队三十个营，计划到1963年建立一百个导弹营。在远东，也加紧在日本、南朝鲜、台湾和冲绳等地建立和扩建导弹基地。另一方面，对某些逐渐失去作用的海外基地也作了一些调整，以减少海外军事开支的压力。例如，美国政府在本月初宣布从冰岛撤出陆军约一千二百人，但仍然保留海空军基地。在这以前，美国政府同菲律宾政府达成协议，把十三个基地归还菲律宾，另外四个有条件归还，但是仍然保留在战时使用这些基地的权利，至于美国在菲律宾的四个主要军事基地却仍然保留。根据艾森豪威尔同摩洛哥国王22日发表的联合公报，美国将在1963年，即是说，在它的发展军事力量的五年计划完成之际，撤出它在摩洛哥的基地。有消息说，美国在摩洛哥的基地的作用将由在西班牙和土耳其等地的导弹基地和空军基地代替。美国报刊承认，这些调整毫不损害美国的全球性战略部署。
