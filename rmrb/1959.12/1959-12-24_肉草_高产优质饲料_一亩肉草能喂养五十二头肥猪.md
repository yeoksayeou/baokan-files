Meat Grass - High-Yield and High-Quality Feed
One Mu of Meat Grass Can Feed Fifty-Two Fat Pigs
Liao Xingyuan, Minister of Rural Work Department, Shiling County Party Committee

Meat grass is a promising feed and green manure crop. The Doulian Brigade of the Yunjiang Commune in Shiling County, Guangxi, was the first to discover and utilize meat grass.

It was only last year that the Doulian Brigade's sideline farm in Yunjiang Commune cultivated meat grass. At that time, the pig farm raised 242 pigs, and the planted area of more than 40 mu of feed was not enough, so they sent ten women to find wild vegetables to maintain the supply. Zhong Yusheng, the deputy director of the sideline business, and Liang Guicai, the farm manager, felt that this was not a long-term solution. They remembered that wild meat grass was not only loved by pigs but could also be eaten by people as vegetables. Why not try planting it in the fields? It was early August at this time, so Liang Guicai found more than ten kilograms of meat grass by the ditch and asked the breeders to plant it in two small fields below the pig farm. After cultivation and fertilization, the meat grass grew very well, and by December there was a harvest, which the pigs loved to eat. Now, the feed for all 62 pigs on the farm is supplied by this one mu of meat grass, and on average, each mu of meat grass can raise more than 50 pigs.

Meat grass, also known locally as Zhuji grass or Goose Vegetable, belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is scientifically known as *Murdannia loriformis*. It grows quickly, has good nutrition, and a sweet taste, making it a good feed for raising pigs. Meat grass is a perennial herb that can grow even in winter. It prefers moist conditions and grows easily in acidic soil. There are two types of meat grass: one grows in moist soil, with thicker stems and a few fine hairs; the other grows in paddy fields, with thinner stems and no hairs. Its shape: the stem has distinct nodes, the leaves are alternate, the petiole wraps around the stem, with purple stripes on the top, the leaves are slender, silvery-white on the back, and the texture is soft, crisp, and non-toxic. According to analysis by the health department, meat grass contains 89% water, 2.8% protein, 1.2% crude fiber, and also contains carotene, riboflavin, and vitamins. In terms of protein content, meat grass is better than sweet potato vines and water hyacinths.

Meat grass has many advantages, specifically:

First, the yield is high. According to farm manager Huang Youlai, Liang Guicai, and breeder Wei Youlan, meat grass can be harvested twice a month. Each mu yields 24,000 catties at a time, with an annual output of about 576,000 catties. Each large pig eats an average of 30 catties per day, and each pig needs 10,950 catties per year. Thus, each mu of meat grass can raise 52 fat pigs. Meat grass has a high yield and is widely used. The stems and leaves of meat grass are tender and crisp, not only nutritious, but also can be fed raw, saving firewood and reducing pig raising costs. The Doulian Brigade's sideline farm uses meat grass to feed pigs, and they gain 15 to 18 catties of fat per month, which is 3 to 5 catties more than when feeding a mixture of wild vegetables and other pig feed. Meat grass can also be eaten as a vegetable, with a fresh, sweet, and delicious taste, comparable to water spinach.

Second, it can grow in all seasons. It can be harvested once every half a month in hot weather and once every half a month in cold weather, making it the best feed for winter and spring.

Third, it is easy to cultivate, saves land and labor. Planting meat grass is the same as planting rice: harrow the paddy mud, apply sufficient base fertilizer, and plant according to the spacing of one chi between plants and rows, with two or three seedlings per clump. If it is too dense, it will not grow robustly; if it is too sparse, the stems and nodes will spread on the ground, and more roots will grow from the nodes, affecting the yield. Fertilize and weed for the first time 15 to 20 days after planting (without cultivating), and then fertilize each time after harvesting. In the past, the Doulian Brigade's sideline farm did not grow meat grass, and more than 200 pigs required more than 40 mu of feed land and 14 people to manage them full-time; now, with only 4 mu of land and 4 people to manage, the pigs cannot finish eating the meat grass.

Fourth, it can be used as green manure. Last year, the Doulian Brigade converted 2.6 mu of meat grass to rice cultivation. It was planted 15 days after "Liqiu" (the Beginning of Autumn), and no fertilizer was applied after planting. It grew very well and yielded a total of more than 1,300 catties of grain, with an average yield of 500 catties per mu, a yield increase of 100% compared to the past.

In short, growing meat grass can solve the contradiction of the lack of pig feed, the contradiction of insufficient fertilizer, the contradiction of insufficient labor, and the contradiction of limited land. It is a treasure for farmers. On December 2, the Shiling County Party Committee held an on-site meeting in Yunjiang Commune to promote the experience of the Doulian Brigade's sideline farm in planting high-yield feed crop - meat grass.

### 肉草——高产优质饲料  一亩肉草能喂养五十二头肥猪

　　肉草——高产优质饲料
　　一亩肉草能喂养五十二头肥猪
　　中共石龙县委农村工作部长　廖兴元
    肉草是一种很有发展前途的饲料和绿肥作物。最初发现和利用了肉草的是广西石龙县运江公社都莲大队。
    运江公社都莲大队副业场栽培肉草不过是去年的事情。那时候，养猪场养了二百四十二头猪，种了四十多亩饲料，不够吃，便派十个妇女专门去找野菜来维持。副业主任钟裕生和场长梁桂才认为长期这样做不是办法，他们想起野生的肉草不但猪爱吃，人也可以当菜吃，不妨种在田里试一试。这时正是8月初，梁桂才便去水沟边找得十多斤肉草回来，让饲养员种在猪场下面的两块小田里。经过中耕施肥，肉草生长很好，12月就有了收获，猪很爱吃。现在全场六十二头猪的饲料，就靠这一亩多肉草供应，平均每亩肉草可养猪五十多头。
    肉草，当地又名竹箕草、鹅儿菜，属鸭跖草科，学名水竹叶。它生长快，营养好，味甜，是养猪的好饲料。肉草为多年生草本，冬季也能生长，性喜潮湿，在酸性土壤易于生长。肉草有两种：一种在潮湿地生长，茎较粗，有少许细毛；一种在水田生长，茎较细，无毛。它的形状：茎具明显的节，叶互生，柄包茎，上面有紫色条纹，叶细长，背面银白色，质柔软松脆，无毒。据卫生部门分析，肉草含水份89％，蛋白质2.8％，粗纤维1.2％，还含有胡萝卜素和核黄素，维生素等。以含蛋白质的成分来说，肉草比红薯藤、水浮莲都好。
    肉草的好处很多，具体地讲有以下几个：
    第一，产量高。据场长黄有来，梁桂才和饲养员韦有兰介绍，肉草每个月可以割两次。每亩一次收二万四千斤，年产量约五十七万六千斤。每头大猪平均每天吃三十斤，一年每头猪需要一万零九百五十斤，这样每亩肉草可以养五十二头肥猪。肉草产量高，而且用途广。肉草茎叶脆嫩，不但营养好，而且可以生喂，节省柴草，降低养猪成本。都莲大队副业场用肉草喂猪，每月长膘十五到十八斤，比用野菜和其他猪菜混合喂的多长三到五斤。肉草还可以拿来当菜吃，味道鲜甜可口，可以和空心菜比美。
    第二，四季能生长。热天半月可以割一次，冷天半月也可以割一次，因此是最好的冬春饲料。
    第三，容易栽培，省地省人工。种肉草和种水稻一样，耙好田泥，施足基肥，按株行距一尺，每蔸二、三苗的规格种植。太密了，生长不粗壮；太稀了，茎节铺地，节生根多，影响产量。种后十五至二十天可进行第一次施肥除草（不中耕），以后割一次施一次肥就行了。都莲大队副业场过去不种肉草，二百多头猪，要四十多亩饲料地，要十四个人专门管理；种肉草只要四亩地，四个人管理，猪就吃不完。
    第四，可作绿肥。都莲大队去年把二亩六分肉草改种稻谷，过了“立秋”十五天才种，种以后没有施肥，生长很好，共收谷一千三百多斤，平均亩产五百斤，比过去增产一倍。
    总之，种肉草可以解决养猪饲料缺乏的矛盾，肥料不足的矛盾，劳力不足的矛盾和土地少的矛盾。它是农家一宝。石龙县委12月2日在运江公社召开现场会议，推广都莲大队副业场种植高产饲料作物——肉草的经验。
