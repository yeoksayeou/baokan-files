Under the Fostering of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
West Germany Speeds Up Military Expansion and Preparation
Proposes an Unprecedentedly Huge Military Budget for Atomic Armament
　　(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Under the fostering and instigation of the United States and the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, West Germany is intensifying its war preparations. The 1960-1961 national budget submitted to the Bundestag by West German Finance Minister Etzel on December 10 stipulates a total expenditure of 41.9 billion marks, the highest figure since the war, of which direct military expenditure amounts to more than 10 billion marks.

　　According to sources in Bonn, important expenditures of the West German Ministry of Defense for the coming year include 51 million marks for so-called "military technology experimentation fees" to develop new weapons, including atomic weapons (nearly nine times the 5.5 million marks for this year). The West German-French joint atomic weapons research institute in Saint-Louis, Alsace, France, will receive a "subsidy" of 3.7 million marks from West Germany (this budget item was 100,000 marks this year).

　　Since the Bundestag passed the resolution in March 1958 to equip the Bundeswehr with atomic weapons, West Germany has openly embarked on the path of atomic armament. According to a report in the West German newspaper "Die Welt," the West German Bundestag Defense Committee agreed on October 7 to a plan proposed by the West German Ministry of Defense to allocate 7.24 billion marks to purchase Hawk missiles from the United States to establish nine missile battalions in the West German Bundeswehr. After these nine missile battalions are established, three Nike missile battalions capable of launching atomic warheads will also be established. After the Council of the "Western European Union" passed a resolution on October 22 this year to lift the ban restricting West Germany from producing missile weapons, West Germany has intensified its atomic armament even further.

　　At the same time, West Germany is constantly expanding its Bundeswehr. When Lieutenant General Kammhuber, Inspector General of the West German Air Force, celebrated the completion of the second West German reconnaissance squadron at an air force base near Munich on December 12, he announced that the strength of the West German Air Force had been expanded to the level stipulated by the North Atlantic bloc for it to reach this year. This squadron is the twelfth active air force squadron that West Germany has built to date. According to the Paris Accords, West Germany should submit 1,326 fighter jets under the jurisdiction of the North Atlantic Command. In addition, West Germany can have 2,000 "auxiliary" aircraft. But the Bonn government now plans to equip the air force with 5,000 aircraft. According to the North Atlantic Group's plan, by the end of 1958, the West German Navy already had 120 ships. In the future, it will be expanded to 170 ships. Recently, a spokesman for the West German Ministry of Defense confirmed that Bonn is vigorously expanding its navy, and negotiations on easing the tonnage limit for West Germany to build certain types of ships are underway within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The British "Daily Express" revealed on November 3 that the West German Ministry of Defense has launched a large-scale plan to rebuild Baltic naval ports and is installing radar equipment.

　　As of 1958, the first phase of West Germany's military buildup had come to an end. According to the second phase plan: before the end of March 1961, twelve army divisions will be built, totaling 200,000 people; in 1962, twenty-one naval squadrons will be built, totaling 25,000 people; by mid-1963, twenty air force wings will be built, totaling 100,000 people. In addition, the local defense forces will be expanded to 25,000 people. The total number of people will reach 350,000. According to a recent announcement by the West German Ministry of Defense, West Germany's total military strength is now 235,000, accounting for two-thirds of the planned strength.

　　在北大西洋公约组织扶植下
    西德扩军备战加快速度
    提出空前庞大军事预算进行原子武装
    本报综合报道　在美国和北大西洋侵略集团的扶植和怂恿下，西德加紧了备战活动。西德财政部长埃策尔于12月10日提交联邦议院的1960—1961年度国家预算，规定岁出总额为四百一十九亿马克，是战后以来最高的数字，其中直接军费数达一百亿马克以上。
    据波恩方面透露的消息，明年度西德国防部的重要开支有用来发展包括原子武器在内的新式武器的所谓“军事技术试验费”五千一百万马克（比本年度的五百五十万马克增加近九倍）。设于法国阿尔萨斯圣路易的西德与法国共有的原子武器研究所，将得到西德的“补助费”三百七十万马克（本年度这项预算为十万马克）。
    自从1958年3月联邦议院通过用原子武器装备联邦国防军的决议以后，西德就明目张胆地走上了原子武装的道路。据西德“世界报”报道，西德联邦议院国防委员会于10月7日同意西德国防部提出的计划，决定拨款七十二亿四千万马克，向美国购买鹰式导弹，在西德国防军中建立九个导弹营。在这九个导弹营建成后，还要建立三个能发射原子弹头的、奈克式导弹营。今年10月22日，“西欧联盟”理事会通过决议，撤销限制西德生产导弹武器的禁令后，西德更加紧进行原子武装。
    与此同时，西德不断扩充国防军。西德空军总监卡姆胡贝尔中将12月12日在慕尼黑近郊某空军基地庆祝西德第二个侦察机中队建成时宣布，西德空军的实力已经扩充到了北大西洋集团规定它应该在今年达到的水平。这个中队是西德迄今为止建成的第十二个现役的空军中队。根据巴黎协定，西德应该把一千三百二十六架战斗机提交北大西洋司令部管辖。此外西德还可以有二千架“辅助”飞机。但是波恩政府现在计划给空军配备五千架飞机。根据北大西洋集团计划，1958年年底，西德海军就已拥有一百二十艘舰艇。今后还将扩大到一百七十艘舰艇。最近西德国防部发言人证实波恩正在大力扩充海军，关于放宽西德建造某种舰艇吨位限制的谈判，已在北大西洋公约组织内部进行。英国“每日快报”11月3日透露，西德国防部已经发起一个重建波罗的海海军港口的大规模计划，并且正在安装雷达设备。
    截至1958年为止，西德建军的第一阶段已告结束。根据第二阶段计划：1961年3月底以前建成十二个陆军师，共二十万人；1962年建成二十一个舰艇中队，共二万五千人；1963年年中建成二十个空军联队，共十万人。另将地方防御部队扩至二万五千人。总共人数达三十五万人。据西德国防部最近宣布，西德兵力现在总共为二十三万五千人，已占计划达到的兵力的三分之二。
