Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 18th: The 20th meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which opened on the 14th, concluded here on the 17th.

    The meeting unanimously adopted a general resolution, a statement on complete and thorough disarmament, an open letter to the working people and trade union organizations of the world on the issue of disarmament, and also adopted resolutions on the establishment of a specialized committee of trade unions for the peaceful use of atomic energy, on holding a world trade union representative conference on the development of economic and trade relations between countries, an open letter from the WFTU Executive Committee to working women and trade unions of all countries on the 50th anniversary of International Women's Day, a resolution on strengthening the WFTU's propaganda activities, and a call for support for persecuted trade union fighters, etc.

    The meeting also unanimously agreed, upon the initiative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, to hold the 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing in 1960, and adopted a resolution accepting the General Federation of Iraqi Trade Unions as a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The meeting also approved the WFTU's budget for 1960 and resolutions on financial issues.

    In the general resolution adopted by the meeting, it mentioned the achievements of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp countries in science, economy, society, and politics, the vigorous development of the struggles of the working people in capitalist countries to achieve their demands, the rapid disintegration of the colonial system under the pressure of anti-imperialist forces around the world, and the continuous growth of the people's forces and trade union movements in Asian, African, and Latin American countries. The general resolution pointed out that all of this is conducive to the working people and peace forces, and unfavorable to imperialism and colonialism.

    The general resolution went on to point out that the Executive Committee reminds the working people and trade union organizations of the fact that despite changes in the world situation, reactionary forces, especially munitions industry trusts and militarist groups, are continuing to oppose the easing of international tensions and the peaceful will of the peoples of all countries.

    The general resolution said that the Executive Committee recommends that the working people and trade union organizations take the demand for complete and thorough disarmament as their central slogan for the "May Day" celebrations in 1960. Trade union organizations should make their own contributions to the broad popular movement for disarmament.

    Kivu Stoica, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, and Apostol, Chairman of the Central Council of Romanian Trade Unions, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 17th to entertain the participants of the meeting.

    世界工联执委会会议闭幕
    十一次理事会会议明年在北京举行
    新华社布加勒斯特18日电　14日开幕的世界工联执行委员会第二十次会议17日在这里闭幕。
    会议一致通过了一项总决议、关于全面彻底裁军的声明、就裁军问题告世界劳动人民和工会组织书，还通过了关于成立和平利用原子能工会专门委员会的决议、关于就发展各国间经济贸易联系问题举行世界工会代表会议的决议、世界工联执委会就国际妇女节五十周年告各国劳动妇女和工会书、关于加强世界工联的宣传活动的决议，以及关于支持受到迫害的工会战士的呼吁书等。
    会议还一致同意根据中华全国总工会的倡议，于1960年在北京举行世界工联第十一次理事会议，通过了接受伊拉克工会总联合会为世界工联会员的决议。会议还通过了世界工联1960年的预算和财经问题的决议。
    会议在通过的总决议中谈到了苏联和整个社会主义阵营国家在科学、经济、社会和政治方面的成就，资本主义国家劳动人民为争取实现自己的要求的斗争的蓬勃发展，殖民体系在全世界反帝国主义力量的压力下的迅速瓦解以及亚非和拉丁美洲各国的人民力量和工会运动的不断增长。总决议指出，这一切都有利于劳动人民和和平力量，而不利于帝国主义和殖民主义。
    总决议接着指出，执行委员会提醒劳动人民和工会组织注意这一事实：尽管世界局势发生了变化，但是反动力量、特别是军火工业托辣斯和军国主义集团正在继续反对缓和国际紧张局势，反对各国人民的和平意志。
    总决议说，执行委员会建议劳动人民和工会组织在1960年“五一”节把要求全面彻底裁军作为自己的中心口号。工会组织应当在争取裁军的广泛的人民运动中作出自己的贡献。
    罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡和罗马尼亚工会中央理事会主席阿波斯托尔17日晚设宴招待会议参加者。罗马尼亚党和国家领导人乔治乌—德治和毛雷尔等出席了宴会。
