    "Excess" and "Correct"
    Xu Feiguang

    There is a Chinese idiom called "correcting a wrong by overcorrecting," meaning to rectify a mistake by exceeding the proper limit. Another idiom is "too much is as bad as too little," meaning exceeding the objectively permissible limit will lead to the opposite. These idioms are not wrong in their original meanings, but right-leaning opportunists distort them to oppose the Party's General Line. When the Great Leap Forward achieved great success, they shouted, saying it was "too fast," "too early," "too high," "too hasty," "too fiery," and so on. In short, they slapped a "too much" label on every major revolutionary measure and every step forward we took.
    Slapping a "too much" label on us is not a new "invention." A brief review of history shows that calling revolutionary parties "extremist parties" and revolutionary actions "extremist behaviors" is "ancient history." Since the day the Communist Party was born, all conservative and reactionary parties and classes have given it the title of "extremist faction," calling its members "extremists," and invariably denouncing all its revolutionary measures and actions as "extreme," "leftist," "excessive," and so on. As early as the First Revolutionary Civil War, Chairman Mao answered those who criticized the peasant movement in Hunan as "excessive" in his "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." It can be seen that the right-leaning opportunists' various arguments about "too much" are just old tunes. However, old tunes with new lyrics still need to be refuted.
    Marxists believe that what constitutes "excess," what constitutes "correct," and what constitutes "too little" cannot be arbitrarily determined by personal subjective desires, but has an objective standard. In our view, all thoughts and actions that reflect the objective requirements of historical development are correct, that is, "correct." Only when the objective process of development is exceeded, when future things are done today, or when things that cannot be achieved through subjective efforts are forced to be done, is this "excess." And failing to keep up with the changing objective situation, failing to keep one's thoughts and actions in line with the changes in the objective situation, is "too little." We oppose "too little" because it lags behind the developing objective reality; we also oppose "excess" because it exceeds the scope allowed by the objective reality. Whether it is "excess" or "too little," because it violates objective laws, it will always run into walls and go bankrupt in the face of reality. Our position is to strictly follow objective laws in all circumstances.
    Using this basic viewpoint to examine our Great Leap Forward, the Great Steel Smelting Movement, and the Great People's Commune Movement, we can see that there is no question of "excess" here at all; because this great movement itself is the inevitable product of China's political and economic development, it reflects the common desire of 600 million people to get rid of the "poor and blank" situation, and this desire is the embodiment of the objective laws of historical development. Facts are the best testimony. The Great Leap Forward did not stop because it was supposedly "excessive." 1958 was a Great Leap Forward, and 1959 continued to be a leap forward; the People's Communes did not collapse and disintegrate because they were "excessive." On the contrary, after rectification and improvement, they have been greatly consolidated and developed forward. The Great Steel Smelting Movement has not affected China's economic development because it was "excessive." Instead, it has developed from "small native groups" to "small foreign groups," becoming a vital force in China's steel industry. It can be seen that it is completely wrong to associate the word "excess" with the great leap forward cause we are carrying out under the illumination of the General Line.
    The essence of the problem is not whether we have "exceeded," but that right-leaning opportunists have completely turned "correct," "excess," and "too little" upside down. They call "correct" "excess," and "too little" "correct." In their view, engaging in mass movements is "excess," while being cold and indifferent is "correct"; high speed is "excess," while a "small-footed woman"-like pace is "correct"; the Great Leap Forward is "excess," while continuing to maintain "poverty and blankness" is "correct"; "exerting full effort and striving for the upper reaches" is "excess," while the "Doctrine of the Mean" and "content to be in the middle reaches" are "correct"; "more, faster, better, and more economical" is "excess," while "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" is "correct." In a word, all destruction of the old order and the emergence of new things are "excess," while "clinging to the old and preserving the remnants" is "correct." In this way, they actually attribute revolution and development to the scope of "excess."
    Who exactly would feel that revolution and development are "excess"? Facts prove that it is only the forces representing the old things that are afraid of the rolling forward and continuous development of history, while the forces representing the new things are striving to promote this development. The working class welcomes revolution, because in the revolution they have nothing to lose but "a chain around their necks," and what they gain is "the whole world." The vast majority of the 600 million Chinese people welcome high speed and the Great Leap Forward, because this means getting rid of the "poor and blank" situation left over from old China as soon as possible, and what they get is "happiness for generations." However, for the bourgeoisie and certain forces representing the bourgeoisie, the situation is different. They may, to a certain extent and within a certain range, approve of or even participate in the revolution, but only to the extent that it does not touch their class interests. Once the revolution is about to finally destroy their "bourgeois kingdom," their shouting of "excess" reflects their nostalgia for and attempt to preserve the old system.
    Revolution is the objective law of social development. As Lenin said, the revolutionary period is "not a deplorable result of extremism and error, but the most vital, most important, most essential, and most decisive turning point in the history of human society" ("Against Boycott"). If revolution is "excess," then we should welcome this "excess." Standing on the bourgeois standpoint and looking at the world with an unchanging eye, revolution is of course "excess" for the old order, and development is also "excess" for stagnation, but without revolution and development, new things cannot be produced and society cannot move forward. The right-leaning opportunists' so-called prevention of "excess" is nothing more than wanting to tie people's hands and feet, only allowing us to make some not "excessive" improvements to the old things within the limits they can tolerate, and not allowing us to carry out thorough revolution. We must answer them with Chairman Mao's words: "To correct a wrong, one must overcorrect; without overcorrecting, one cannot correct the wrong." Only by "exceeding" the bourgeoisie's "correctness" can we correct the bourgeoisie's wrong, thereby ensuring the proletariat's "correctness."
    Of course, in a great movement of 600 million people, small "excesses" or "too littles" are unavoidable. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in On Practice: "People engaged in transforming reality are often subject to many limitations, not only often subject to the limitations of scientific and technological conditions, but also subject to the limitations of the development of the objective process and the degree of its expression." Moreover, these small "excesses" or "too littles" are bound to be overcome. And the right-leaning opportunists exaggerate certain individual temporary, or even already overcome or are rapidly overcoming shortcomings, as an overall and frequent phenomenon. This is the method of cutting off both hands when seeing a finger is sick.
    In the struggle against right-leaning opportunism, we have understood a truth. When we hear others accusing us of "excess" and "too little" in our progress, we must treat them differently according to different situations. If they stand on the proletarian position and put forward well-intentioned opinions on certain work, with the purpose of doing this work better, this should of course be welcomed. If they use the excuse that one finger is sick to cut off our hands, we should be more vigilant and expose their reactionary position and purpose in time. Never treat their lies as truth.

### “过”和“正”

    “过”和“正”
    徐非光
    中国有一句成语叫做“矫枉过正”，意思是纠正错误而越过了应有的限度；还有一句成语叫做“过犹不及”，意思是越过了客观所允许的限度，便会走到反面。这些成语从原来的意义上来说是并不错的，可是右倾机会主义分子却把它们加以歪曲用来反对党的总路线。当全民大跃进取得了伟大成绩的时候，他们却在那里大喊大叫，说什么“过快”了，“过早”了，“过高”了，“过急”了，“过火”了，等等。总之，他们把我们的每一个重大的革命措施，把我们前进的每一步，都扣上了一个“过”的帽子。
    给我们扣上一个“过”的帽子，并不是什么新的“发明”。稍为回顾一下历史就可以知道，把革命政党叫做“过激党”，把革命行动叫做“过激行为”，这是“古已有之”的。自从共产党产生那一天起，一切保守的反动的政党和阶级就给他加上“过激派”的头衔，称他的党员为“过激分子”，并且把他的一切革命措施和行动也无不指责为“过激”、“过左”、“过分”……。毛主席早在第一次国内革命战争时期，就在“湖南农民运动考察报告”中回答了那些指责农民运动“过”了的论调。可见右倾机会主义者关于“过”了的种种议论，不过是老调而已。但是，老调子，新唱词，还有驳斥的必要。
    马克思主义者认为，什么是“过”、什么是“正”、什么是“不及”，并不能由个人的主观愿望来随意判定，而是有一个客观标准的。在我们看来，凡是反映历史发展客观要求的思想和行动，就是正确的，也就是“正”。只有超过了客观过程一定的发展阶段，把将来的事放到今天来做，或把经过主观努力仍无法达到的事硬要去做，这才是“过”；而落后于变化着的客观情况，不能使自己的思想和行动随着客观情况的变化跟上去，这才是“不及”。我们反对“不及”，因为它落后于发展着的客观实际；也反对“过”，因为它超过了客观实际所允许的范围。不管是“过”还是“不及”，由于都违背了客观规律，所以在现实面前总是要碰壁和破产的。我们的主张则是在任何情况下都要严格地按照客观规律办事。
    用这个基本观点来考察我们的大跃进、大炼钢铁、大办人民公社运动，就可以看出在这里根本谈不到什么“过”的问题；因为这个伟大的运动本身就是我国政治经济发展的必然产物，它反映了六亿人民摆脱“一穷二白”状况的共同愿望，这种愿望就是历史发展的客观规律的体现。事实是最好的见证，大跃进并没有因为所谓“过”了而停顿下来，1958年是大跃进，1959年还是继续跃进；人民公社并没有因为“过”了而垮台散伙，反而经过整顿和提高，大大地巩固并向前发展了；大炼钢铁也没有因为“过”了而影响我国经济的发展，反而已经从“小土群”发展到“小洋群”，成为我国钢铁工业的生力军。可见把“过”字和我们在总路线照耀下所进行的伟大跃进事业联系在一起是完全错误的。
    问题的实质不在于我们是否“过”了，而在于右倾机会主义分子把“正”、“过”、“不及”完全弄翻了个。他们把“正”说成是“过”，又把“不及”说成是“正”。在他们看来，大搞群众运动是“过”，而冷冷清清才是“正”；高速度是“过”，而“小脚女人”似的步伐才是“正”；大跃进是“过”，而继续保持“一穷二白”才是“正”；“鼓足干劲、力争上游”是“过”，而“中庸之道”和“甘居中游”才是“正”；“多快好省”是“过”，而“少慢差费”才是“正”。一句话，凡是旧秩序的破坏、新事物的产生统统是“过”，而“抱残守缺”才是“正”。这样，他们实际上把革命和发展都归之于“过”的范围了。
    到底什么人会感到革命和发展是“过”呢？事实证明，害怕历史滚滚向前不断发展的只是代表旧事物的力量，而代表新事物的力量则是努力推进这一发展。工人阶级欢迎革命，因为他们在革命中失去的只有“自己颈上的一条锁链”，而获得的却是“整个世界”。六亿中国人民绝大多数欢迎高速度和大跃进，因为这就是意味着及早摆脱旧中国遗留下的“一穷二白”局面，而他们得到的却是“万代幸福”。但是，对于资产阶级和某些代表资产阶级的势力，情况就不同了。他们在一定时期一定范围内也可以赞成甚至参加革命，但是这只能以不触及他们的阶级利益为限度。一旦当革命要最后摧毁他们的“资产阶级王国”的时候他们高喊“过”了，正是反映了他们留恋和力图保存旧制度的心情。
    革命是社会发展的客观规律。正如列宁所说的，革命时期，“不是过激和谬误的可悲的结果，而是人类社会历史中最有生气、最重要、最本质、最具有决定性的关头”（“反对抵制”）。如果说革命是“过”的话，那么我们就应当欢迎这种“过”。站在资产阶级的立场上用千古不变的眼光去看世界，革命对于旧秩序来说当然是“过”，发展对于停滞来说也是“过”，但是没有革命和发展就不可能产生新生事物，社会也不可能前进。右倾机会主义分子的所谓防“过”，不过是想要束缚人们的手脚，只让我们在他们所能够忍受的限度内对旧的东西作一些不“过分”的改良，而不准我们进行彻底的革命。我们必须用毛主席的话回答他们：“矫枉必须过正，不过正不能矫枉”。只有“过”资产阶级之“正”，才能矫资产阶级之枉，从而保证无产阶级之“正”。
    当然，在一个六亿人民的伟大运动中，小的“过”或“不及”是难免的。正像毛泽东同志在实践论中所说的：“从事变革现实的人们，常常受着许多的限制，不但常常受着科学条件和技术条件的限制，而且也受着客观过程的发展及其表现程度的限制”。而且这些小的“过”或“不及”是一定会克服的。而右倾机会主义分子把某些个别的暂时的甚至早已克服了或者正在迅速克服中的缺点夸大为全体的经常的现象，这是看到一个指头生病就要割掉双手的办法。
    在反对右倾机会主义的斗争中我们懂得了一条真理。在听到别人指责我们前进中的“过”和“不及”时，必须根据不同的情况予以不同的对待。如果他们站在无产阶级立场，对某些工作提出善意的意见，目的是为了把这些工作作得更好，这当然是应该欢迎的。如果他们借口一个指头有病而要割去我们的双手，我们就要多加警惕，及时揭露他们反动的立场和目的。千万不要把他们的谎言当作真理。
