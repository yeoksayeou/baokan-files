(Our newspaper Harbin, December 3rd dispatch) The Harbin basic construction department systematically summarizes and promotes complete sets of technical innovation achievements from the large-scale mass movement. It rapidly concentrates one-off and local innovation results, persists in them, and turns them into complete sets of assets for everyone. From the second quarter of this year to now, they have summarized and promoted 169 sets and 2,068 pieces of innovative machinery in the city in the fields of construction woodworking, rebar, plumbing, concrete, sheet metal, and ventilation. This has enabled 72 processes in six trades to use a combination of indigenous and foreign machinery, realizing mechanization. At the same time, in the plastering and bricklaying trades, they summarized and promoted 29 kinds of advanced tools and advanced operating methods for 29 processes, greatly increasing construction efficiency. Now, the average labor productivity of construction and installation workers in the city has increased by 98% compared to the first quarter of this year, with one person doing the work of two. The quality of all projects has reached excellent, and safe production has been basically achieved.

Systematically summarizing and promoting complete sets of innovation achievements is a new requirement for the in-depth development of the technical innovation movement. Last year, basic construction workers in the city created more than 6,000 pieces of indigenous and foreign innovative machinery and greatly improved operating methods, ensuring a great leap forward in construction. However, these innovation achievements were scattered across various construction sites. From the perspective of the entire city, there were many different kinds of innovations for the same trade, the same process, and the same purpose, with varying degrees of effectiveness. A reform that had already succeeded in one place was still being explored and tested in another. A failure in one place was being repeated in the same way in another. In particular, within the same trade, one place reformed several processes, while another place reformed other processes, each having only half a set, each missing something, and not complementing each other. In response to this situation, the Harbin basic construction department adopted a method of systematically summarizing and promoting complete sets of innovations.

The work of systematically summarizing and promoting complete sets of innovation achievements by the Harbin basic construction department is carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee, with the joint participation of various forces. At each construction site and engineering company, it is a combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses of workers. At the city level, it is a combination of the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and scientific research units, as well as advanced producers and veteran workers organized by them. They compare, select, and evaluate the innovation achievements scattered on various construction sites, from the construction site to the company, and then to the city, layer by layer, according to the criteria of "easy to use, easy to manufacture, low cost, and high efficiency." They select good experiences from them, "match them up," combine them into complete sets, and promote them comprehensively.

This approach has yielded three major benefits in promoting the development of the technical innovation movement. First, it can extract the essence from the rough and select the best from the good. The "horizontal cutting saw" created by the 201 Construction Site was a relatively good machine for the woodworking material cutting process, with an efficiency ten times higher than manual operation. In the process of systematically summarizing and promoting complete sets, the "wheel-type material cutting saw" of the 202 Construction Site and the "material cutting saw" of the 103 Construction Site were found to be even better. Finally, the "material cutting saw" was selected and promoted, with an efficiency 25 times higher than manual operation. Second, it complements the missing parts, extends the short legs, and combines them into complete sets according to trade. In the woodworking trade of the 505 Construction Site, innovative machinery had been created for eight of the eleven processes in the past, reducing the 380 carpenters needed for manual operation to 128. This time, they learned and promoted the innovative machinery of the 503 Construction Site and the Municipal Timber Processing Plant, enabling the entire trade to use a complete set of innovative machinery, reducing the number of carpenters to 36. In the past, because three processes did not have innovative machinery, the innovative machinery that had been adopted could not fully exert its effectiveness, and the average labor productivity of each carpenter was only five times higher than manual operation. Now, with the adoption of a complete set of innovative machinery, each person's efficiency is 25 times higher than in manual operation. Third, it enables machinery for the same purpose and similar operating methods to concentrate advantages, learn from each other's strengths, and improve further. The advanced plastering method of Li Shenghua, the representative of Harbin City at the National Congress of Heroes, is twice as efficient as the production quota. Now, by combining the advantages of the nationally renowned "Yang Dezong plastering method" and "Zhu Siming plastering method" learned and used by others with the advantages of his plastering method, a "comprehensive advanced plastering method" has been formed, with an efficiency four times higher than the production quota.

The Harbin basic construction department has been carrying out the work of systematically summarizing and promoting complete sets of innovation achievements continuously since the second quarter of this year, and each time it has pushed the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new climax. The first time, in just over eighty days, they selected the best innovative creations scattered on various construction sites, combined them into seven sets, and promoted 103 sets and 1,703 pieces. The second time, after more than a month, the supporting machinery had new developments, and three types of 23 pieces of fixed operation machinery grew legs and developed into "mobile machinery." Since the third time, another six sets of woodworking, rebar, and concrete machinery have developed towards "linking," so that each process is balanced in production, avoiding intermittency. This approach is repeated, so that the results of technical innovation are continuously improved and expanded. (Attached picture)

    哈尔滨基本建设部门抓住技术革新运动的重要一环
    系统总结和成套推广革新成果
    全市建筑安装工人的劳动生产率八个月提高98％
    本报哈尔滨3日电　哈尔滨市基本建设部门把大规模群众运动中的技术革新创造，加以系统总结，成套推广，把一事一地的革新成果迅速集中起来，坚持下去，变为大家的成套财富。从今年第二季度到现在，他们在全市范围内总结和推广了一百六十九套、二千零六十八台（件）革新机具，使全市建筑施工方面的木工、钢筋、水暖、混凝土、白铁、通风等六个工种七十二道工序用上了土洋结合的机械，实现了机械化；同时在抹灰和瓦工两个工种二十九道工序，总结和推广了二十九种先进工具和先进操作法，成倍地提高了施工效率。现在全市建筑安装工人的劳动生产率平均比今年第一季度提高了98％，一个人顶两个人用，工程质量全部达到优等，同时基本上做到了安全生产。
    系统总结并成套推广革新成果，是技术革新运动向纵深发展提出的新要求。去年全市基本建设职工创造了六千多台（件）土洋结合的革新机具，大量改进操作方法，保证了施工大跃进。但是，这些革新成果分散在各个工地上，从全市范围看，同一工种、同一工序和同一用途的革新，花样很多，效果高低不齐；一种改革，有的地方已经成功了，别的地方还在摸索试验，有的地方失败了，别的地方还在走着同样的弯路；特别是同一工种，这个地方改革了几道工序，那个地方又改革了另外几道工序，各有半套，都有缺门，没有互相补充。针对这一情况，哈尔滨市基本建设部门采用了系统总结、成套推广的办法。
    哈尔滨市基本建设部门系统总结和成套推广革新成果的工作，是在党委统一领导下，组织各方面力量共同进行的。在各个建筑工地和工程公司，是领导干部、技术人员和职工群众相结合；在全市范围，是市建筑工程局、市总工会和科学研究单位以及他们组织的先进生产者和老工人相结合。他们把分散在各个工地上的革新成果，从工地到公司，再到全市，类类比，层层选，逐级评定，按照“使用方便，制造容易，成本低，效率高”的标准，从中选出好的经验，“对号入座”，搭配成套，全面推广。
    这种作法在推动技术革新运动的发展方面收到了三大好处。第一，可以粗中取精，良中取优，好的里边选好的。二零一工地创造的“卧式截锯”，是木工截料工序上较好的机具，比手工操作效率高十倍。在系统总结、成套推广过程中，又发现了二零二工地的“带轮式截料锯”和一零三工地的“截料锯”比它还好，最后选中和推广了“截料锯”，比手工操作效率高二十五倍。第二，按工种补齐缺门，接长短腿，搭配成套。五零五工地木工工种的十一道工序过去已有八道创造出了革新机具，使当时手工操作所需要的三百八十名木工减少为一百二十八名；这次，他们学习推广了五零三工地和市木材加工厂的革新机具，使整个工种用上了全套革新机具，木工人数减少为三十六名。过去因有三道工序没有革新机具，已采用的革新机具不能充分发挥效能，每个木工的劳动生产率平均只比手工操作提高五倍，现在，采用全套革新机具，每个人比手工操作时提高效率二十五倍。第三，使同一用途的机具和同类操作方法能集中优点，取长补短，提高一步。哈尔滨市出席全国群英会的代表李升华的先进抹灰法，效率比生产定额高两倍；现在把别人学习运用的全国著名的“杨德重抹灰法”和“朱泗明抹灰法”的优点，和他的抹灰法的优点集中在一起，形成“综合先进抹灰法”，效率比生产定额高出四倍。
    哈尔滨市基本建设部门系统总结和成套推广革新成果的工作，从今年第二季度以来已连续进行过三次，每次都把技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高潮。第一次，仅用八十几天就把分散在各个工地上的革新创造选出最好的配成七套，推广了一百零三套、一千七百零三台（件）。第二次，过了一个多月，配套机具有了新的发展，三种二十三台（件）固定作业的机具长了腿，发展成为“流动机具”。第三次以来，又有木工、钢筋、混凝土等六套机具向“连动化”发展，使各道工序平衡生产，避免间歇。这种作法循环不已，就使技术革新成果不断提高不断扩大。（附图片）
