The Historical Phenomenon of Agriculture Lagging Behind Industry Can Be Overcome

Industry and agriculture are the two major material production sectors in the national economy, and they are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Agriculture provides industry with food and various raw materials, a market for industrial products, and a continuous supply of strong labor; modern industry provides agricultural production with important means of labor and rural residents with daily industrial consumer goods, which can promote the improvement of agricultural production technology and meet the needs of farmers for living goods. Therefore, agriculture is the foundation on which industry exists and develops, and modern industry is the most important source for the technological development and improvement of agriculture.

If we put aside the long-existing handicraft industry, modern industry only began to appear in the capitalist stage of historical development. The emergence and development of capitalist industry, in addition to other conditions, also depends on the development of agriculture. Marx once pointed out: "A certain degree of development of domestic or foreign agriculture is the basis for the development of capital." (Marx: "Theories of Surplus Value" Volume 1, p. 42)

However, in all capitalist countries, without exception, agriculture always lags behind the development of industry. This is the law of capitalist economic development. Lenin pointed out: "The development of agriculture lagging behind industry is a phenomenon inherent in all capitalist countries, and is one of the most profound causes of the disruption of proportions between various sectors of the national economy, the occurrence of crises and high prices." ("Lenin Collected Works" Volume 22, p. 84)

The lagging of capitalist agriculture behind industry has caused serious economic consequences. It has further deepened the opposition between cities and villages that has existed for thousands of years. Cities have highly developed productivity and have become economic, political, and cultural centers, while rural areas have long been trapped in technical backwardness and ignorance. This situation seriously hinders the progress of the entire society. The lagging of agriculture behind industry also disrupts the proportional relations of the national economy. The deformed development of industry increasingly requires colonies to provide agricultural raw materials and markets for industrial products, forming an international division of labor of a predatory nature between capitalist world industrial countries and agricultural countries. The lagging of agriculture behind industry makes the prices of agricultural products high, the lives of the working class deteriorate, and the cost of industrial products increase. All of this affects the development of industry. The contradiction of agriculture lagging behind industry cannot be fundamentally overcome in a capitalist society based on private ownership of the means of production. However, this situation will be gradually overcome in a socialist society based on public ownership of the means of production. Marx said: "...The fact that industry develops more rapidly than agriculture is originally a characteristic of the capitalist mode of production. But this is a historical difference that can be eliminated." (Marx: "Theories of Surplus Value" Volume 2, p. 247)

The Great Role of Agricultural Development in Promoting Industrial Development

Under the socialist system, while gradually overcoming the contradiction of agriculture lagging behind industry, the role and significance of agriculture in promoting industrial development has also greatly increased compared to capitalism. Socialist agriculture does not passively adapt to the development of industry, but actively plays a huge role in promoting and facilitating industrial development.

The promoting and facilitating role of socialist agriculture in industrial development is first manifested in the provision of human resources. The source of human resources for capitalist industrial development relies on the bankruptcy of a large number of farmers and handicraftsmen, and the spontaneous and blind flow of the rural population to cities; where there is a huge relative surplus population. Under the socialist system, farmers will never go bankrupt, and unemployment has been eliminated. In this way, it is necessary to plan the allocation of labor between industry and agriculture, and continuously transfer a large number of laborers from agriculture to supplement the needs of urban industrial construction; at the same time, manpower must also be freed up in rural areas to engage in small and medium-sized industrial production. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "The peasants—this is the predecessor of the Chinese workers. In the future, tens of millions of peasants will enter the cities and enter the factories. If China needs to build a strong national industry and build many modern big cities, there must be a long process of transforming the rural population into the urban population." To extract manpower from agriculture to run industry can only be done if agriculture continues to develop. Therefore, here, increasing agricultural labor productivity has particularly important significance. China has more than 500 million peasants, of which there are more than 200 million laborers and semi-laborers. Every 1% increase in agricultural labor productivity can free up more than 2 million full and semi-laborers while maintaining the total agricultural output unchanged. Suppose that half of them are used to increase agricultural production, and the other half are invested in industrial production, then more than 1 million full and semi-laborers will be transferred to industrial production. Therefore, developing agriculture and increasing agricultural labor productivity is very important for promoting the development of the country's industry.

The second aspect of the promoting and facilitating role of socialist agriculture in industrial development is capital accumulation. Capitalist industrial development has also absorbed capital from agriculture, which was obtained through the plunder of small peasant producers, through unequal exchange and the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products. At the same time, the bourgeois state also plunders the peasant class through taxation. Under the socialist system, national industrialization has become the common goal of workers and peasants, and they jointly undertake the task of accumulating funds for industrialization. Although, due to the low agricultural labor productivity, each peasant provides less accumulation compared with workers. However, because China's agricultural population accounts for an absolute advantage, the amount of industrialization funds that farmers can provide is very large. Agriculture accumulates funds for industry mainly in the following forms: First, through the form of agricultural tax. Socialist peasants have freed themselves from the exploitation of rent, and their lives have been improved and raised accordingly, which can provide a certain amount of capital accumulation for national industrialization. Second, the state accumulates funds for industrialization by selling light industrial products to rural areas and purchasing agricultural, sideline, and special local products from farmers. Third, the savings deposits of the vast number of farmers can also be used by the state for industrial construction.

The third promoting role of socialist agriculture in industrial development is that agriculture provides industry with grain and raw materials. Industrial construction requires grain first; without grain, workers and the urban population will have nothing to eat. The development of light industry requires agricultural raw materials, and certain heavy industrial sectors also need agricultural and sideline products as auxiliary materials. The grain and raw materials needed by capitalist industry flow into the city spontaneously from the countryside, and the law of value spontaneously regulates the production of grain and raw materials to meet the requirements of industrial development. At the same time, capitalist countries also continuously obtain grain and raw materials from colonies and dependent countries (the United Kingdom is the most obvious). Under the socialist system, the production of grain and raw materials is carried out in a planned manner. In this way, the production of grain and raw materials largely determines the speed and scale of industrial construction. This is not only the case for light industry, but often also for heavy industry. Judging from the situation of my country's economic construction in the past ten years, in years of agricultural harvest, when the growth rate of agricultural output is faster, the growth of industrial production in the current or the next year is also faster; conversely, when natural disasters are greater and affect agricultural production increase, the growth rate of industry in the current or next year will also be slower. In 1958, my country's Great Leap Forward in the national economy also started with the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

The promoting and facilitating role of socialist agriculture in industrial development is also manifested in the market issue. The industrial products produced by socialist industrial enterprises must be sold in order to carry out expanded reproduction. In capitalist society, due to the increasing impoverishment of the working people and the imbalance of the national economy (agriculture lagging behind industry is one of its most important elements), the sales of industrial products are hampered; the periodic economic crises make capitalist commerce even more depressed, and industrial products are not easy to sell. Under the socialist system, the situation is completely opposite. With the continuous development of agricultural production in our country and the continuous improvement of farmers' lives, the demand of rural residents for industrial products is also increasing. This is a huge force driving the development of industrial production in our country. From 1952 to 1958 in our country, farmers' incomes increased by 42.9%, and the total supply of agricultural production materials increased by 373.8%, which is a very obvious example. When Chairman Mao talked about the market for industrial development, in addition to talking about the close relationship between light industry and agriculture, he also emphasized the importance of agriculture as a market for heavy industry. He said: "The point that heavy industry needs agriculture as an important market has not yet been made very clear to people. But with the gradual development of agricultural technological reform and the increasing modernization of agriculture, machinery, fertilizers, water conservancy construction, power construction, transportation construction, civilian fuel, civilian building materials, etc. serving agriculture will increase day by day. The situation in which heavy industry regards agriculture as an important market will be easily understood by people." Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction is very important at a time when China's agriculture is gradually moving towards modernization.

It can be seen that any viewpoint that ignores and underestimates the positive role of agriculture in the national economy, and believes that agriculture should only passively adapt to the development of industry, is theoretically wrong and harmful to practical work.

Fully Develop Agriculture and Light Industry with Heavy Industry as the Center

In his book "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong further reminded us that the issue of the relationship between socialist industrial and agricultural development is an issue of the path to industrialization. He said: "The issue of the path to industrialization mentioned here mainly refers to the issue of the development relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture. It must be affirmed that our country's economic construction takes heavy industry as the center. But at the same time, we must fully pay attention to the development of agriculture and light industry." Comrade Mao Zedong's understanding of the relationship between industry and agriculture to the level of industrialization has particularly important significance for practical work. It tells us that realizing national industrialization is not just a question of how to carry out industrial construction, but also a question of how to build agriculture. And the latter is the foundation of the former. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "During the second and third five-year plans, if our agriculture can have greater development, and light industry can have more development accordingly, it will be beneficial to the entire national economy. When agriculture and light industry develop, heavy industry will have a market and funds, and it will develop faster." This policy is fully in line with the basic principles of Marxist reproduction, the laws of socialist economic development, and the specific social and economic conditions of our country.

According to the principles of Marxist reproduction, social reproduction is divided into two major categories, namely the first category that produces the means of production and the second category that produces the means of consumption. In real economic life, the former is mainly manifested as heavy industry, and the latter is mainly manifested as agriculture and light industry. The relationship between the first category and the second category is actually mainly manifested as the relationship between heavy industry and agriculture and light industry. Marx pointed out that in order to carry out expanded reproduction, there is a need for: first, additional means of production; second, additional means of consumption; and third, additional labor. Additional means of production are mainly produced by heavy industry, while additional means of consumption and labor must be provided by agriculture and light industry. Among the latter, agriculture is particularly important. Because agriculture not only produces grain and raw materials for light industry, but also a huge source for replenishing labor in expanded reproduction. Socialist reproduction is characterized by high-speed expanded reproduction, therefore, in the process of economic construction, not only should heavy industry be developed with priority, but also efforts should be made to develop agriculture and light industry. Neglecting any one aspect will hinder the high-speed development of socialist construction.

Since the relationship between heavy industry and agriculture and light industry reflects the mutual relationship between the first category and the second category, it also constitutes the most important content of the national economic proportions. The planned and proportional development of the socialist economy, the most important of which is to adjust the relationship between heavy industry and agriculture and light industry, so that they can develop in a coordinated and mutually cooperative manner. Therefore, the policy of "developing industry must go hand in hand with developing agriculture" is also required by the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy. Correctly implementing this policy can grasp the strategic proportional relationship in the national economy, and establish a comprehensive balance of the entire national economy on this basis. This is the reason why Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly reminded us of the importance of actively developing agriculture while emphasizing the realization of national industrialization in the process of leading our country's economic construction.

Judging from the experience of our country's economic construction, agriculture has extreme importance in the national economy. It is the foundation for the development of the national economy. In 1958, the total agricultural output value increased by 131.4% compared with 1949. During the same period, the total industrial output value increased by 829.4%, and industrial and agricultural production were basically adapted to each other. In the future, to ensure the high-speed development of the national economy, it is necessary to continue to develop industry, but first, we must ensure the rapid development of agriculture. What measures should be taken to rapidly develop agriculture?

Marx pointed out that there are two basic forms for realizing expanded reproduction: one is expanded reproduction under the condition of unchanged technology, and the other is expanded reproduction under the condition of improved technology. Of course, the two are often combined in economic life. Taking agricultural production as an example, the former method is to increase the amount of agricultural labor, extend working hours, increase labor intensity, expand the cultivated area and increase the amount of labor per mu under the condition of unchanged technology; the latter method is to realize agricultural technological revolution and technological innovation, and realize the modernization of agriculture. We have always attached great importance to agricultural technological reform, and the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture is a scientific summary of implementing agricultural technological reform under China's conditions. However, since our country's industrial base was very weak in the past, industry could not provide agriculture with a large number of machines, fertilizers, electricity, automobiles, etc. Therefore, in the past few years, agricultural technological reform could only be carried out on a certain scale. In some cases, it had to adopt the first form of expanded reproduction to a greater extent.

Now, our situation is beginning to change. The successful completion of the first five-year plan has laid a preliminary foundation for our country's industrialization. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959 have enabled our country's industrial construction to achieve greater development. The strength of industry to support agriculture has greatly increased. In 1958, industry provided agriculture with 3.15 billion yuan of major means of production, which is equivalent to more than half of the total of 5.19 billion yuan of means of production provided in the previous five years. Moreover, because we have implemented the policy of combining central industry and local industry, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production in industrial construction, a certain amount of industrial technology has been widely distributed throughout the urban and rural areas of our country. In addition, the people's commune system that has been established in our country's rural areas can accommodate different levels of productivity of socialist society and communist society, thus opening up the broadest road for the development of production. That is to say, the social conditions for realizing agricultural technological transformation in our country are already fully available. In the future, more efforts should be made to support the modernization of agriculture. In order to realize agricultural technological transformation as soon as possible, the production of heavy industry must be greatly increased, especially to provide agricultural production with more machinery, farm tools, fuel, electricity, chemical fertilizers, and building materials. At the same time, light industry should also supply more daily necessities. Therefore, realizing agricultural technological transformation and rapidly developing agriculture also require industry to develop faster. Giving priority to the development of heavy industry is still an urgent task. Neglecting this point is also wrong. Only by combining giving priority to the development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture can the speed of socialist construction in our country be accelerated.

    论农业和工业的关系
    俞明仁
    农业落后于工业的历史现象可以克服
    工业和农业是国民经济中的两大物质生产部门，它们之间是互相依赖互相促进的关系。农业给工业提供粮食和各种原材料，提供工业品的销售市场和不断向工业输送强壮的劳动力；现代工业则给农业生产提供重要的劳动资料和给农村居民提供日用工业消费品，它可以促进农业生产技术的提高和满足农民生活用品的需要。因此，农业是工业借以存在和发展的基础，现代工业则是农业技术发展和提高的最重要的源泉。
    如果撇开久已存在的手工业不谈，现代工业是在历史发展的资本主义阶段才开始出现的。资本主义工业的发生和发展，除了其他条件之外，还要以农业的发展为条件。马克思曾经指出：“本国农业或者外国农业的一定发展程度，是资本的发展基础。”（马克思：“剩余价值学说史”第一卷，第42页）
    但是，在一切资本主义国家中，毫无例外地农业总是落后于工业的发展。这是资本主义经济发展的规律性。列宁指出：“农业的发展落后于工业，这是一切资本主义国家所固有的现象，是国民经济各部门间的比例遭到破坏、发生危机和物价高涨的最深刻的原因之一。”（“列宁全集”第二二卷第84页）
    资本主义农业落后于工业，造成了严重的经济后果。它使几千年来城市和乡村的对立进一步加深了，城市具有高度发达的生产力和成为经济、政治、文化的中心，而农村则长期陷于技术落后和愚昧无知的状态。这种情况严重地阻碍了整个社会的进步。农业落后于工业还使国民经济的比例关系遭到破坏，工业的畸形发展愈来愈需要殖民地提供农业原料和工业品的销售市场，形成资本主义世界工业国和农业国间的掠夺性质的国际分工。农业落后于工业使农产品的价格高昂，工人阶级的生活
  日益恶化和工业品的成本提高，这一切都影响到工业的发展。农业落后于工业的矛盾，在以生产资料私有制为基础的资本主义社会是根本无法克服的。但是，这种情况，在以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义社会是会逐渐被克服的。马克思说过：“……工业比农业发展得更迅速这件事，本来就是资本主义生产方法的特征。但这是一个历史上的差异，是能够消灭的。”（马克思：“剩余价值学说史”第二卷，第247页）
    农业发展对推动工业发展的巨大作用
    在社会主义制度下，与逐渐克服农业落后于工业的矛盾的同时，农业对工业发展的作用和意义比起资本主义来也大大提高了。社会主义农业不是消极地适应着工业的发展，而是积极地对工业的发展起着巨大的推动和促进作用。
    社会主义农业对工业发展的推动和促进作用，首先表现在提供人力资源方面。资本主义工业发展的人力来源依靠大量农民和手工业者的破产，依靠农村人口自发、盲目地流向城市；在那里存在着庞大的相对人口过剩。在社会主义制度下，农民根本不会发生破产的事情，失业现象也消灭了。这样，就需要有计划地在工业和农业之间调配劳动力，不断地从农业中调出大批劳动力来补充城市工业建设的需要；同时，在农村中也要腾出人手来从事中小型的工业生产。毛主席早就指出过：“农民——这是中国工人的前身。将来还要有几千万农民进入城市，进入工厂。如果中国需要建设强大的民族工业，建设很多的近代的大城市，就要有一个变农村人口为城市人口的长过程。”要从农业中抽出人力来办工业，只有在农业不断发展的情况下才办得到。因此，在这里，提高农业的劳动生产率就有特殊重要的意义。我国有五亿多农民，其中有二亿以上的劳动力和半劳动力，农业劳动生产率每增加1％，就能在保持农产总量不变的情形下腾出二百多万个整、半劳动力来。设若其中一半用之于增加农业生产，另一半投入工业生产，那么，转入工业生产的整、半劳动力就有一百多万人。因此，发展农业，提高农业劳动生产率，这对推动国家工业的发展是十分重要的。
  社会主义农业对工业发展的推动和促进作用的第二个方面是资金积累。资本主义工业的发展也曾从农业中吸取过资本，那是通过对农民小生产者的掠夺，通过不等价交换和工农业产品的剪刀差而得到的。同时，资产阶级的国家，也通过税收的形式掠夺农民阶级。在社会主义制度下，国家工业化成为工人和农民共同奋斗的目标，他们共同担负着积累工业化资金的任务。虽然，由于农业劳动生产率较低，与工人比较起来每个农民提供的积累也较少。但是由于我国农业人口数量占着绝对优势，因此，农民所能提供的工业化资金的数额是很多的。农业为工业积累资金主要有以下的一些形式：第一，通过农业税的形式。社会主义农民摆脱了地租的剥削，他们的生活因之得到了改善和提高，可以为国家工业化提供一定的资金积累。第二，国家通过向农村销售轻工业品，向农民收购农副土特产品，为工业化积累资金。第三，广大农民的储蓄存款，国家也可以将其一部分用到工业建设中去。
    社会主义农业对工业发展的第三个促进作用是农业向工业提供粮食和原料。工业建设首先需要粮食，没有粮食，工人和城市人口就没有吃的。发展轻工业需要有农产原料，某些重工业部门也需要农副产品作为辅助材料。资本主义工业所需要的粮食和原料，是从农村自发地流入城市，价值规律自发地调节着粮食和原料的生产，以适应工业发展的要求。同时，资本主义国家还不断地从殖民地附属国取得粮食和原料（英国表现得最为明显）。在社会主义制度下，粮食和原料的生产都是有计划地进行的。这样，粮食和原料的生产，就在很大程度上决定着工业建设的速度和规模。不仅轻工业是如此，重工业也往往是如此。从我国十年来经济建设的情况来看，凡是农业丰收之年，农业产量增长速度较快，当年或者次年的工业生产增长也就较快；反之，凡是自然灾害较大，影响农业增产，当年或者次年的工业增长速度也就较慢。1958年，我国国民经济的大跃进，也是从农业生产的大跃进开始的。
    社会主义农业对工业发展的推动和促进作用，还表现在市场问题上。社会主义工业企业生产出来的工业品，必须销售出去，才能进行扩大再生产。在资本主义社会中，由于劳动人民的日益贫困化和国民经济的比例失调（农业落后于工业是其最重要的要素之一），使工业品的销售遭到困难；周期性的经济危机，更使资本主义商业萧条，工业产品不易销售。在社会主义制度下，情况就完全相反。随着我国农业生产的不断发展和农民生活的不断提高，农村居民对工业品的需求也在日益增长。这是推动我国工业生产发展的一支巨大力量。我国从1952年到1958年，农民收入增长了42.9％，农业生产资料供应总额增长了373.8％，就是一个很明显的例子。毛主席在谈到工业发展的市场时，除了谈到轻工业和农业的密切关系之外，还着重强调了农业作为重工业市场的重要意义。他说：“重工业要以农业为重要市场这一点，目前还没有使人们看得很清楚。但是随着农业的技术改革逐步发展，农业的日益现代化，为农业服务的机械、肥料、水利建设、电力建设、运输建设、民用燃料、民用建筑材料等等将日益增多，重工业以农业为重要市场的情况，将会易于为人们所理解。”毛泽东同志的这个指示，在我国农业逐步走向现代化的时候，显得十分重要。
    可见任何忽视和低估农业在国民经济中的积极作用，认为农业只应该消极地适应着工业发展的观点，在理论上是错误的，对实际工作也是有害的。
    以重工业为中心充分发展农业和轻工业
    毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一书中，进一步提醒我们，社会主义工业和农业发展关系的问题，是一个工业化道路的问题。他说：“这里所讲的工业化道路的问题，主要是指重工业、轻工业和农业的发展关系问题。我国的经济建设是以重工业为中心，这一点必须肯定。但是同时必须充分注意发展农业和轻工业。”毛泽东同志把工农业的关系提高到工业化道路问题上来认识，这对实际工作有特别重要的意义。它告诉我们，实现国家工业化不仅仅是如何进行工业建设的问题，而且必须考虑如何建设农业的问题。并且后者还是前者的基础。毛泽东同志说：“在第二个五年计划和第三个五年计划期间，如果我们的农业能有更大的发展，使轻工业相应地有更多的发展，这对于整个国民经济会有好处。农业和轻工业发展了，重工业有了市场，有了资金，它就会更快地发展。”这个方针是完全符合马克思主义再生产的基本原理，符合社会主义经济发展的规律和我国社会经济的具体情况的。
    根据马克思主义再生产的原理，社会再生产划分为两大部类，即生产生产资料的第一部类和生产消费资料的第二部类。在现实经济生活中，前者主要表现为重工业，后者主要表现为农业和轻工业。第一部类和第二部类的关系，实际上主要表现为重工业和农业、轻工业的关系。马克思指出，为了进行扩大再生产，需要有：第一，追加的生产资料，第二，追加的消费资料，第三，追加的劳动力。追加的生产资料主要是由重工业生产的，追加的消费资料和劳动力则必须由农业和轻工业提供。在后者之中农业尤其重要。因为农业不但生产粮食和轻工业原料，而且还是扩大再生产中补充劳动力的巨大源泉。社会主义再生产是以高速度扩大再生产为特征的，因此，在经济建设过程中，不仅要优先发展重工业，而且要努力发展农业和轻工业，忽视任何一个方面都会妨碍社会主义建设的高速度发展。
    重工业和农业、轻工业的关系既然表现了第一部类和第二部类的相互关系，因之它也就构成了国民经济比例中的最重要的内容。社会主义经济有计划按比例的发展，其中最重要的也就是要调整重工业和农业、轻工业的关系，使其协调地互相配合地向前发展。因此，“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举”的方针，也是国民经济有计划按比例发展规律所要求的。正确地执行这个方针，就能抓住国民经济中的战略性的比例关系，在这个基础上建立整个国民经济的综合平衡工作，毛泽东同志在领导我国经济建设的过程中，在强调实现国家工业化的同时，一再向我们提醒积极发展农业的重要性，就是这个道理。
    从我国经济建设的经验来看，农业在国民经济中具有极端的重要性。它是国民经济发展的基础。1958年的农业总产值，比1949年增长131.4％，同一时期工业总产值增长829.4％，工农业生产基本上是相适应的。今后要保证国民经济的高速度发展，既要继续发展工业，还必须首先保证农业的迅速发展。采取什么办法迅速发展农业呢？
    马克思指出实现扩大再生产有两种基本形式，一种是在技术不变条件下的扩大再生产，一种是在技术提高条件下的扩大再生产。当然，这两者在经济生活中是经常结合在一起的。以农业生产来说，前者的办法就是增加农业劳动力数量，延长劳动时间，提高劳动强度，在技术条件不变的情况下，扩大耕地面积和增加每亩地上的用工量等等；后者的办法是实现农业技术革命和技术革新，实现农业的现代化。我们一向是十分重视农业技术改革的，农业八字宪法就是在我国情况下实行农业技术改革的科学总结。但是，由于我国过去的工业基础十分薄弱，工业不能给农业提供大量的机器、化肥、电力、汽车等等，因此，过去几年，农业技术改革只能在一定的规模上进行，在某些情况下，还不得不较多地采用第一种扩大再生产的形式。
    现在，我们的情况要开始改变了。第一个五年计划的胜利完成，已给我国的工业化奠定了初步基础。1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进，又使我国的工业建设获得更大发展。工业支援农业的力量大大增强了。1958年工业向农业提供的主要生产资料达三十一亿五千万元，相当于前五年提供的生产资料总和五十一亿九千万元的一半以上。并且，由于我们在工业建设上贯彻执行了中央工业和地方工业、大型企业和中小型企业、洋法生产和土法生产相结合的方针，已使我国的全国城乡都广布了一定的工业技术力量。此外，在我国农村已经建立起来的人民公社制度，可以容纳社会主义社会和共产主义社会的不同程度的生产力，从而为生产的发展开辟了最广阔的道路，这就是说，我国实现农业技术改造的社会条件，也已经是充分具备了。今后应该以更多的力量去支援农业的现代化了。为要尽快地实现农业技术改造，重工业的生产必须大大增长，特别是要给农业生产更多的机械、农具、燃料、电力、化肥和建筑器材等等。同时，轻工业也要供应更多的生活日用品。因此，实现农业技术改造和迅速发展农业，也要求工业更快地发展。优先发展重工业，仍然是迫切的任务。忽视这一点，也是错误的。必须把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，才能加快我国社会主义建设的速度。
