    Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: This reporter reports: The Japanese people's struggle against the revision and for the abrogation of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," regardless of the Kishida Nobusuke group's frenzied suppression, is developing in a magnificent manner.
    In order to conclude this military alliance treaty in mid-January next year, which is hostile to China and the Soviet Union and suppresses the national independence movements of Japan and various countries in the Far East, the Kishida Nobusuke group has not only adopted despicable means such as threats, sabotage, and deceptive propaganda, but has even recently implemented large-scale armed suppression. On November 27th, the Tokyo police used force to suppress the masses petitioning the Diet, resulting in a bloody tragedy in which more than two hundred people were injured.
    However, the heroic and unyielding Japanese people were not intimidated by this suppression. Millions of people launched the eighth national unified action across the country on that day as planned. It pushed the struggle against the "Security Treaty" to a new high.
    The increasingly powerful united struggle of the Japanese people has panicked the Kishida Nobusuke group. They have drafted a bill to prohibit demonstrations in and around the Diet and all courts, attempting to further deprive the people of their democratic rights. They also illegally searched trade unions such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Tokyo Regional Council of Trade Unions, and the National Metalworkers' Union, which actively participated in the opposition to the "Security Treaty," under the pretext of the so-called "Public Security Ordinance," which had long been ruled unconstitutional by the courts. The police authorities of the Kishida Nobusuke government also convened a meeting of police chiefs to deploy the suppression of the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and progressive groups, attempting to launch a more rampant offensive against patriotic and democratic forces and undermine the ninth unified action.
    This fascist policy of the Kishida Nobusuke government has aroused even greater anger and resistance from the Japanese people. The Japanese Communist Party has continuously exposed the enemy's conspiracies, calling on the people to maintain and strengthen the anti-American patriotic united front and repel the enemy's attacks. National organizations and many mass organizations in various regions such as the Socialist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan Peace Committee, the Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Congress of Journalists, and the Japan "Security Treaty Criticism Association" have all issued statements or passed resolutions, strongly protesting against the Kishida Nobusuke government's suppression, and expressing their determination not to succumb to the pressure of the reactionaries and to fight to the end.
    Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch, Tokyo: Seventy representatives of the people of Osaka, Japan, began a four-day sit-in demonstration in front of the Diet tonight, demanding that the government immediately stop negotiations on the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." These demonstrators are representatives of the Osaka National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," including communists and socialists, workers and farmers.

    岸政府的威胁、破坏和欺骗无济于事
    日本人民斗争意志坚不可摧
    大阪人民派代表在国会前静坐示威
    据新华社9日讯　本社记者报道：日本人民反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的斗争，不顾岸信介集团的疯狂镇压，正在波澜壮阔地发展。
    岸信介集团为了在明年1月中旬缔结这个同中苏为敌并且镇压日本和远东各国民族独立运动的军事同盟条约，不仅采取了威胁、破坏、欺骗宣传等卑鄙手段，最近甚至实行大规模的武力镇压。在11月27日东京警察就曾武力镇压向国会请愿的群众，造成了二百多人受伤的流血惨案。
    但是，英勇不屈的日本人民并没有被这种镇压所吓住，数百万人民按照计划当天在全国各地展开了第八次全国统一行动。它把反对“安全条约”的斗争推向了新的高潮。
    日本人民日益强大的联合斗争使岸信介集团感到恐慌。他们拟订了禁止在国会和所有法院周围游行示威的法律草案，企图进一步剥夺人民的民主权利。他们还假借早已被法院判决违反宪法的所谓“公安条例”，非法搜查日本工会总评议会、东京地方工会评议会、全国金属工会等积极参加反对“安全条约”的工会。岸信介政府的警察当局并且召集了警察头目会议，布置镇压日本共产党、社会党和进步团体，企图向爱国民主力量发动更猖狂的进攻，并破坏第九次统一行动。
    岸信介政府这种法西斯政策激起了日本人民更大的愤怒和反抗。日本共产党不断地揭露了敌人的阴谋，号召人民维护和加强反美爱国统一战线，击退敌人的进攻。社会党、日本工会总评议会、日本和平委员会、日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会、日中友好协会、日本新闻记者会议、日本“安全条约批判会”等全国性组织和各地许多群众团体都发表声明或通过决议，强烈抗议岸信介政府的镇压，并且表示决不屈服于反动派的压力，坚决斗争到底。
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本大阪人民的七十名代表今天晚上开始在国会前面举行为时四天的静坐示威，要求政府立即停止关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判。这些示威者是大阪阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议的代表，其中有共产党人和社会党人，工人和农民。
