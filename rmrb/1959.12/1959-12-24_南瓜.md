    Pumpkins and pumpkin vines are both good pig feed.
    Ten jin of pumpkin has the nutritional value of one jin of barley. Pumpkins are very productive. Early-maturing "seven-leaf gourds" can produce fifty jin of gourds per plant. Three hundred plants per mu will yield a total of 15,000 jin. They can be harvested forty to sixty days after planting, and vegetables can also be planted between rows. Mid- and late-maturing pumpkins can yield about 200 jin per plant, with high yields reaching up to 300 jin.
    Pumpkins can be ensiled for several months. (Image attached)

    南瓜和南瓜藤蔓都是很好的猪饲料。
    十斤南瓜的养分可顶上一斤大麦。南瓜产量很高，早熟的七叶瓜，每株能产瓜五十斤，一亩种三百株，总产量达一万五千斤。种后四十到六十天就能收获。而且株行间还可种植蔬菜。中晚熟的南瓜，每株可收获二百斤左右，高产的可达三百斤。
