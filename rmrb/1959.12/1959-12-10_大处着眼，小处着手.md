When hundreds of millions of people's commune members brave wind and snow, split mountains and block rivers, build canals and divert water, eating in the wilderness and living in the wilderness, caring for the lives of the masses becomes a serious political issue.

Organizing production and organizing life have always been two inseparable aspects of the same thing. Only by ensuring that people are fed, warm, and well-rested can they work better. The higher the enthusiasm of the masses for labor, the more important it is to care for their lives - this has always been one of the hallmarks of the close ties between our Party and the masses. If someone thinks this is a "trivial matter of life," then they are completely wrong. They will become detached from the masses, and inevitably fail to complete the tasks assigned by the Party.

The fact that Xinjiang has made good preparations for winter and is able to make rapid progress on projects shows that the Party committees at all levels in Xinjiang have truly put politics in command in winter water conservancy projects. They can both "think big" and "start small."

    大处着眼，小处着手
    当千百万人民公社社员冒着风雪严寒，劈山拦河、修渠引水，吃在荒野，住在荒野的时候，关心群众生活就成为严重的政治问题。
    组织生产同组织生活从来就是不可分割的一件事情的两个方面。只有保证人们吃饱、住暖、休息好，才能劳动得更好。群众劳动热情越高，就越要关心群众的生活——这从来就是我们党和人民群众血肉相连的标志之一。如果有人认为这是“生活小事”，那就大错特错了，那样就要脱离群众，必然也就完不成党所交给的任务。
    新疆各地由于冬季过冬准备工作做得好，所以能够做到工程进展迅速。这一事实说明，新疆各级党委在冬季兴修水利工程中真正作到了政治挂帅，他们既能从“大处着眼”，又能从“小处着手”。
