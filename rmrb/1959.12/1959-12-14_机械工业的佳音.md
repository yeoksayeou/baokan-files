Good News for the Machinery Industry

　　Producing blanks is the first basic process in the machinery industry. Only with blanks can parts be processed, and only with parts can machines be assembled. The quantity and quality of blanks ultimately determine the output and quality of machines. In the past two years, due to the rapid growth of machining capacity, the production of blanks has lagged behind processing. This requires greatly increasing casting and forging capacity. Gradually realizing die forging is one of the important measures to improve forging capacity and ensure the production of blanks quickly, efficiently, and economically.

　　To gradually realize die forging, sufficient forging hammers and forging dies are needed. The relevant departments have made unified arrangements for the production of forging hammers. How to manufacture forging dies quickly, efficiently, and economically was originally a problem that had not been completely solved. Now, the successful use of cast steel surfacing welding by the First Automobile Factory to manufacture forging dies for ten-ton forging hammers has opened up a new path for manufacturing large forging dies. The problem of manufacturing forging dies can also be solved smoothly. The experience of the First Automobile Factory should be vigorously promoted in a planned way. Promoting this experience will allow us to produce more blanks and ensure a faster leap forward in the machinery industry.

    机械工业的佳音
    生产毛坯是机械工业的第一道基本工序，有了毛坯，才能加工零件，有了零件，才能装配成机器；毛坯的多少、好坏，最终决定机器的产量和质量。近两年，由于机械加工能力的迅速增长，出现了毛坯生产落后于加工的情况。这就要大大提高铸造和锻造能力。而逐步实现模锻化，就是提高锻造能力、保证多快好省地生产毛坯的重要措施之一。
    要逐步实现模锻化，需要有足够的锻锤和锻模。锻锤的生产，有关部门已作了统一安排。如何多快好省地制造锻模，原来还是个没有完全解决的问题。现在，第一汽车厂用铸钢堆焊的方法制造十吨锻锤用的锻模成功，就为制造大型锻模开辟了新的途径。锻模的制造问题也可以顺利解决了。第一汽车厂的经验应该有计划地大力推广。推广了这一经验，便可以更多地生产毛坯，保证机械工业更快地跃进。
