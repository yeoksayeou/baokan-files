    Kishi Government Mobilizes Ten Thousand Police
    Deliberately Suppressing Workers Participating in Unified Action
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 9th: The Kishi Nobusuke government's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Etusaburo Shiina, openly stated today that the government intends to suppress Japanese workers who are scheduled to strike tomorrow in opposition to the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    Shiina Etusaburo issued a statement, stubbornly claiming that the just actions of Japanese workers in holding strikes to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty" "exceed the scope of the right to collective action guaranteed by the Constitution."
    He especially threatened members of the Japan Council of Public Corporation Workers' Unions (JCPCWU), who are expected to play a key role in tomorrow's strike, clamoring that these government agencies and public utility workers will absolutely not be allowed to participate in the strike.
    Shiina Etusaburo said that the government intends to "severely punish" personnel who "violate the law" by participating in the strike.
    According to Kyodo News, the Kishi Nobusuke government is preparing to dispatch ten thousand police officers to Tokyo tomorrow to "maintain vigilance."
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 5th: Disregarding the protests of the Japanese public, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has decided to further suppress progressive political parties and labor unions in an attempt to undermine the Japanese people's ninth national unified action against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The Kishi Nobusuke government's National Police Agency held a national criminal division chiefs' conference in Tokyo on the 3rd and 4th to plot the suppression of the Japanese Communist Party and demanded that police agencies in various regions "seriously heighten vigilance" regarding the struggle to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
