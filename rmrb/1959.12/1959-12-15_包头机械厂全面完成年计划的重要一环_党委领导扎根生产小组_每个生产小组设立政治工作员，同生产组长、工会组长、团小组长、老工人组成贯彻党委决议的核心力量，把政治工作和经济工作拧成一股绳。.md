Baotou, December 14th (reporter from this newspaper) – The Baotou Machinery Plant, an advanced collective that attended the National Conference of Heroes, has adhered to the principle of putting politics in command, continuously carried out mass movements, and constantly overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. It has comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan for eleven consecutive months this year. The annual state production plan, as well as technical and economic indicators such as quality, cost, profit delivery, and improved labor productivity, were also fully completed by the end of November.

The Baotou Machinery Plant's monthly and comprehensive success this year is mainly because, in the midst of vigorous mass movements, it implemented the "firm, fast, unified, and comprehensive" working methods. "Firm" means firmly implementing the instructions and resolutions of the higher-level Party committee; "fast" means the Party's resolutions quickly meet with the masses; "unified" means under the unified leadership of the factory Party committee, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League unify their thinking, actions, and work arrangements; "comprehensive" means comprehensively arranging work.

At the beginning of this year, this factory, which had just transitioned from mechanical repair to mechanical manufacturing, undertook the task of manufacturing nearly two thousand tons of complete sets of cement equipment, coal washing equipment, and various non-standard equipment for the Baosteel No. 1 blast furnace, many of which were "high, large, and precise" products. To accomplish this arduous task, problems such as equipment, technology, and materials had to be solved. First, it was necessary to reverse the negative emotions of a few cadres and clear the ideological obstacles on the road to the Great Leap Forward. According to the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, the factory Party committee led all employees in launching a great debate on two kinds of ideologies and two kinds of methods, and carried out positive education on continuous revolution for the employees, greatly boosting their enthusiasm. Within a week, the workers created twelve kinds of advanced tools, such as "snake swallowing an elephant" and "ants gnawing at bones," for processing large parts with small machines. The foundry workshop also used a three-ton cupola furnace to cast a gantry planer base weighing eleven tons, and a five-ton crane managed to lift the eleven-ton blank into the workshop, quickly overcoming the equipment barrier. Subsequently, the factory Party committee further mobilized the masses to overcome barriers in materials, technology, personnel, and management. With fewer personnel than last year, the factory completed three times more production tasks in the first quarter than in the same period last year.

At the beginning of the second quarter, a few cadres exaggerated certain shortcomings in the quality of products in the first quarter, believing that high speed and quantity could not coexist with quality and economy, and that only by reducing production targets could quality be guaranteed. The factory Party committee promptly launched mass criticism and debate, criticizing the erroneous view that "quality and quantity" could not leap forward together, and strengthened the worker self-inspection system in the production teams. "Defective Product Medical Stations" were established in various workshops, and high-quality product exhibition stands and breakthrough quota miracle stands were set up. At the same time, groups that had not produced a single defective product for fourteen months and overfulfilled their tasks every month, and individuals who had not produced a defective product for five years, were established as pacesetters. As a result, the finished product rate of new product castings increased from the planned 70% to 73.3%, and the waste from product rework in April was 3,700 yuan, which dropped sharply to 174 yuan in May.

Resolutely and decisively implementing the instructions of the higher-level Party committee is a major characteristic of the factory's Party committee leadership method. In April, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee held a regional industrial secretaries' meeting in Baotou. On the same day that the meeting made a resolution on launching a socialist red flag competition, the factory's Party committee convened a Party committee meeting to formulate a plan for implementing the resolution and quickly promoted it at a workers' representative meeting that evening. Within three days, a surge of competition to catch up and surpass each other and strive to become red flag bearers formed throughout the factory. Immediately afterwards, the Party committee studied the specific content and methods of organizing the competition based on the production characteristics of each workshop. For example, the "thousand-machine-hour" competition was promoted in the metal processing workshop, the "one-topping-two" (one person doing the work of two) competition was promoted in the forging and riveting workshop, and the "ten-thousand-jin-hundred-yuan" (producing ten thousand jin of castings per person per month and saving one hundred yuan) competition was launched in the foundry workshop. Through these competitions, the factory's production efficiency was greatly improved. In the "thousand-machine-hour" competition, the metal processing workshop increased work efficiency by one to twenty-five times.

In order to quickly transform the Party's resolutions into the actions of all employees, the factory's Party committee concentrated its efforts to strengthen the work of the production teams in a thorough and meticulous manner, and established worker political work personnel in each team. At the same time, with the political work personnel as the backbone, it absorbed the production team leader, the labor union group leader, the Communist Youth League group leader, and experienced veteran workers to form the leading core of the production team. Under the leadership of the workshop Party branch, this core became the grassroots force for implementing the Party committee's resolutions, so that political and ideological work took deep root in each team, and political work and economic work were closely integrated. Since the establishment of political work personnel in the production teams, the Party committee's resolutions could quickly meet with the masses, the political atmosphere in the teams was strong, and the ranks of advanced producers continued to expand. The strengthening of political work in the teams has achieved economic results such as a gradual reduction in costs and a continuous increase in labor productivity. From January to November this year, the total cost of comparable products decreased by 26.8% compared to last year, and labor productivity increased by 127% compared to last year, overfulfilling the plan every month, with continuous increases in output and quality, greatly promoting the early completion of the annual plan.

The factory's Party committee conscientiously implemented the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee, combined with the system of each committee member being responsible for their respective duties. The completion of each task was uniformly arranged by the Party committee and handled by all parties, which ensured the Party's unified leadership and brought into play the role of each organization. For example, in February, when receiving the task of manufacturing one hundred machine tools, a few cadres felt that time was pressing and had varying degrees of negative emotions. The Party committee first convened an enlarged meeting of Party committee cadres. After specific analysis, it criticized these negative emotions and conservative thinking, found measures to overcome the difficulties, and called on all employees to launch a technical innovation movement to complete the task. Then, the Party committee secretary, the factory director, and engineers went deep into the weak links, worked shifts with the workers, and strengthened the leadership of the metal processing workshop. Other Party committee members also went deep into other workshops. The labor union organized a technical innovation competition, mobilizing employees to propose more than twelve thousand innovation projects, while also focusing on three major tasks—evaluation and rewards, employee education, and employee life—to promote production. The Communist Youth League also focused on educating young workers and apprentices about quality and conservation, launching a red apprentice competition, and giving play to the youth's daring to think and act. Through the efforts of all employees, the machine tool manufacturing task was overfulfilled by 34%.

    包头机械厂全面完成年计划的重要一环
    党委领导扎根生产小组
    每个生产小组设立政治工作员，同生产组长、工会组长、团小组长、老工人组成贯彻党委决议的核心力量，把政治工作和经济工作拧成一股绳。
    本报包头14日电　出席全国群英会的先进集体——包头机械厂，坚持政治挂帅，持续开展群众运动，不断地克服右倾保守思想，今年连续十一个月全面超额完成国家计划。全年的国家生产计划以及质量、成本、上交利润、提高劳动生产效率等技术经济指标，也在11月底全面完成。
    包头机械厂今年生产月月红、全面红，主要是因为在大搞群众运动中，贯彻执行了“坚、快、统、全”的工作方法。“坚”是坚决贯彻执行上级党委的指示和决议；“快”是党的决议和群众见面快；“统”是在厂党委的统一领导下，党、政、工、团统一思想，统一行动，统一安排工作；“全”是布置工作全面。
    今年年初，这个刚由机械修配转为机械制造的工厂，就承担了生产成套水泥设备、洗煤设备和包钢一号高炉各种非标准设备近二千吨的制造任务，其中有不少是属于“高、大、精”的产品。为了完成这样繁重的任务，必须解决设备、技术、材料等问题，首先就要扭转少数干部的畏难情绪，扫清跃进路上的思想障碍。工厂党委根据上级党委指示，领导全体职工展开了两种思想、两种方法的大鸣大放大辩论，并向职工进行不断革命的正面教育，大大鼓起了职工们的干劲。在一个星期内，工人们就创造了“蛇吞象”和“蚂蚁啃骨头”等小机器加工大部件的十二种先进工具，铸工车间也用三吨冲天炉铸出了重达十一吨的龙门刨底座，五吨吊车也设法把十一吨重的毛坯吊进了车间，迅速攻破了设备关。接着，工厂党委会又深入发动群众，连破材料、技术、人员、管理关。在人员比去年有所减少的情况下，这个工厂第一季度完成了比去年同期多三倍的生产任务。
    第二季度开始的时候，少数干部夸大了第一季度产品质量上的某些缺点，认为多快就不能好省，只有降低产量指标才能保证质量。工厂党委一面及时地发动群众鸣放辩论，批判了“质和量”不能齐跃进的错误观点，一面加强了生产小组中的工人自检制度。在各车间建立了“废品医疗站”，设立了优质产品展览台和突破定额奇迹台，同时树立了十四个月没出一件废品、月月超额完成任务的小组和五年没有出过废品的个人为标兵。这样，使新产品铸件成品率由计划的70％提高到73.3％，4月份产品返修浪费为三千七百元，5月份一下就降到一百七十四元。
    贯彻执行上级党委指示坚决果断，雷厉风行，是这个工厂的党委领导方法的一个主要特点。4月份，内蒙古党委在包头召开了全区工业书记会议，在会议作出关于开展社会主义红旗竞赛的决议的当天，这个工厂的党委就召开党委会制定了贯彻执行这个决议的方案，并在当天晚上召开了职工代表大会迅速推行。三天之内，全厂形成了你追我赶、个个争当红旗手的热潮。紧接着，党委又根据各车间生产的特点，研究了组织竞赛的具体内容和方法。例如在金属加工车间推广了“千台时”竞赛，在锻铆车间推行了“一顶二”（一个人顶二人干活）竞赛，在铸工车间展开了“万斤百元”（每人每月生产一万斤铸件，节约一百元）竞赛。通过这些竞赛，全厂生产效率大大提高。金属加工车间在“千台时”竞赛中，提高工作效率一至二十五倍。
    这个厂的党委为了使党的决议迅速变成全厂职工的行动，集中力量深入细致地加强了生产小组的工作，在每个小组设立了工人政治工作员。同时，以政治工作人员为骨干，吸收生产组长、工会小组长、共青团小组长和技术水平较高的老工人，组成生产小组领导核心，在车间党支部领导下，成为基层贯彻党委决议的核心力量，使政治思想工作在每个小组中深深地扎下根，把政治工作和经济工作紧密地结合了起来。自从生产小组建立了政治工作人员以后，党委决议很快就能和群众见面，小组政治空气浓厚，先进生产者队伍不断扩大。小组政治工作的加强，收到了成本逐步降低和劳动生产率不断提高的经济效果。今年1至11月份，可比产品的总成本，比去年降低了26.8％，劳动生产率比去年提高了127％，月月超额完成计划，产量、质量持续上升，大大地促进了年度计划的提前完成。
    这个厂的党委认真贯彻执行了党委领导下的厂长负责制和各个委员分工负责相结合的制度。每项任务的完成，都由党委统一安排，各方去办，既保证了党的统一领导，又发挥了各个组织的作用。例如2月份，在接到百台机床的制造任务时，少数干部感到时间匆迫，有着程度不同的畏难情绪。党委首先召开了党委扩大干部会议，经过具体分析，批判了这些畏难情绪和保守思想，找到了克服困难的措施，号召全厂职工开展技术革新运动来完成任务。接着，党委书记、厂长、工程师深入薄弱环节，跟班劳动，加强了对金属加工车间的领导。其他党委委员也分别深入了其他车间。工会组织技术革新竞赛，发动职工提出了革新项目一万二千多项，同时抓住评比奖励、职工教育、职工生活三件大事，来推动生产。共青团也在青年工人和徒工中抓质量、抓节约的教育，开展红色徒工竞赛，发挥青年的敢想敢干作用。经过全厂职工的努力，结果，超额34％完成了机床制造任务。
