Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 1st. At the meeting of the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on the 1st, the discussion of the reports made by Kadar and Fock began.

    Minich, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, spoke on the national and economic leadership work. Minich said that from the very beginning, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government had established collective leadership and the establishment of collective leadership forms as one of the main principles of its activities. He said that the direction of the government's work is correct. It has basically completed its tasks well in implementing the Party's policies. Minich said that in terms of national economic leadership, we have taken a series of measures. Local councils at all levels have made great efforts to meet the economic, social welfare and cultural needs of residents. The widespread absorption of working people into administrative and economic leadership over the past three years is one of the main factors of our victory. In the future, the connection with the masses will be strengthened more widely and deeply.

    Apro, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and First Deputy Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, spoke about the commodity supply, foreign trade, and economic cooperation with socialist countries. He pointed out that only by continuously increasing production and improving labor productivity can the improvement of people's living standards be guaranteed in the long run. This year, Hungary's industrial and agricultural production will reach the main indicators of 1960 stipulated in the Three-Year Plan. Therefore, the growth of employees' actual income and commodity retail sales has also exceeded the indicators stipulated in the Three-Year Plan. In the past three years, the state construction and state loans have built a total of 107,000 private housing units. From the counter-revolutionary incident to the present, residents' savings have increased by 3.3 billion forints, a growth of more than five times. The commodity supply for residents is very good, both in cities and in rural areas. Apro said that in realizing the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan, foreign trade and close cooperation with socialist countries are of particular significance. He said that we trade with most countries in the world. The trade volume with socialist countries accounts for about three-quarters of Hungary's foreign trade volume. Hungary's international payments are now balanced. Apro said that in the future, Hungary will further develop economic mutual assistance and cooperation with fraternal countries.

    Elde, Chairman of the Hungarian National Council of Women, Krauko, First Secretary of the Bekes County Party Committee, Benke, First Secretary of the Szabolcs-Szatmar County Party Committee, and Rambosh, First Secretary of the Gyor-Sopron County Party Committee, also spoke at the meeting on the 1st.

    At the meeting on the 1st, representatives of the fraternal parties of France, Italy and Morocco also delivered speeches successively.

    Duclos, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the French Communist Party, pointed out that the Hungarian counter-revolutionary event in 1956 was not only an event in Hungary, but also an international event, which caused an anti-Soviet and anti-communist backlash internationally. The French reactionary group also took the opportunity to attack the French Communist Party, but the French people firmly supported the just struggle of the Hungarian people. More than 50 cities across the country held anti-imperialist parades and demonstrations. In his speech, Duclos congratulated the Hungarian people on their great achievements in socialist construction. Duclos also said that the French people warmly welcomed Khrushchev's visit to France, which showed the French people's friendship towards the Soviet Union. Duclos said that the French people unanimously demanded that the French government immediately start negotiations with the Algerian government. Duclos also condemned the French government for insisting on carrying out atomic weapons tests in the Sahara, regardless of the opposition of the world's people. Duclos finally said that the prestige of the French Communist Party among the people is growing. The broad masses of the people clearly see that the French Communist Party is truly fighting for the interests of the people. The French Communist Party adheres to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and unswervingly fights for the victory of the world communist movement.

    Bagetta, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, praised the victory of the Hungarian people in crushing the counter-revolutionary riots in 1956 in his speech. He said that Italian communists are now engaged in a struggle on two fronts, namely, opposing revisionism on the one hand and opposing sectarianism and dogmatism on the other. He said that the reactionaries clamored to bury the Italian Communist Party, but due to the Party's correct policies, more and more new forces are supporting us.

    Ali Yata, First Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Moroccan Communist Party, said in his speech that your elimination of the counter-revolutionary rebellion not only saved the dictatorship of the proletariat in your country, but also greatly encouraged the national liberation struggle and helped the cause of peace. Your victory proves that the imperialists cannot turn back the wheel of history.

    Ali Yata said that the Moroccan government's declaration of the Moroccan Communist Party as illegal has aroused the opposition of the Moroccan people. He pointed out that although Morocco is independent, foreign troops are still stationed on its territory. He said that we demand that the French and Spanish troops withdraw from Morocco and demand the abolition of the US military bases in Morocco.

    The speeches of the representatives of the fraternal parties were warmly welcomed.

    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 2nd. The Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party continued its meeting on the morning of the 2nd to discuss the reports of Kadar and Fock.

    The Congress first listened to and adopted the report of the Credentials Committee.

    Then, Kallai Gyula, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, spoke on the issue of ideological revolution and cultural revolution.

    In his speech, Kallai analyzed the development of the ideological and cultural revolution in Hungary since liberation. He pointed out that in the past three years, the Socialist Workers' Party has resolutely defended Marxism-Leninism in the struggle against counter-revolution, and has crushed the rampant attacks of various kinds of bourgeois hostile views and revisionism.

    Kallai said that at present, bourgeois ideology still exists and plays a role among the broad masses of the people. This is not only in the minds of some people, but also manifested in daily life, in the fields of science, literature and art. We must strengthen political propaganda and education, expose those hostile and erroneous views, and liquidate them in principled struggle and ideological struggle.

    Kallai said that socialist construction requires accelerating the socialist transformation of the masses' ideological consciousness, and socialist morality, socialist labor attitude and patriotism must take root in the broadest masses in a relatively short period of time. This is the ideological condition for us to transition to communist construction after a not-too-long historical period.

    Kallai pointed out that internationally, peaceful coexistence does not mean compromise in principle and politics, nor does it mean ideological coexistence, but rather to conduct open and sharp ideological struggle. In the period of peaceful coexistence, we must strengthen the struggle against all bourgeois ideological manifestations.

    Kallai emphasized that in order to accomplish the above tasks, the Party must strengthen ideological and cultural work and make it an integral part of the Party's overall work. He also said that the leading role of the Party in socialist construction requires every Party member to study, improve their professional skills and knowledge level. He said that the Chinese slogan "Red and Expert" is also effective here.

    Kallai said that today there are still many remnants of revisionism. It is still the main danger in social sciences. Although this latent revisionism has lost its public platform, it is still conducting defensive battles in the scientific and journalistic circles in a hidden form, looking for forms of expression adapted to the new conditions. In the field of literary research, some people are also trying to revive the "art for art's sake" literature. Today, it is no longer enough to just fight against revisionism in a general way. We should conduct Marxist observation and analysis of specific historical, economic, philosophical, and literary issues to free our social sciences from the shackles of revisionism. We should strengthen ideological purity and communist party spirit.

    When talking about the Party's policy towards intellectuals, Kallai said that our policy towards intellectuals has been proven correct in life. Intellectuals have accepted the Party's policies and are working to implement them. He said that most intellectuals have not yet established a Marxist-Leninist world outlook. We hope that they will strengthen ideological transformation and serve the working people.

    After Kallai's speech, Ulbricht, head of the delegation of the German Socialist Unity Party and First Secretary of the Central Committee, gave a congratulatory speech to the Congress. When talking about the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident in 1956, he said that this incident gave the workers of the German Democratic Republic a great lesson. He also said that Nagy Imre's transformation from an opportunist to a traitor to the motherland clearly shows where revisionism will lead.

    Ulbricht pointed out that the residents of the German Democratic Republic, the residents of West Berlin, and the peace-loving forces in West Germany especially hope that a summit meeting of heads of government can be held so that the consequences of Hitler's war can be eliminated in Germany, the "Cold War" can be ended, and a peace treaty can be signed.

    Next , Bacilek, head of the delegation of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and member of the Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech to the Congress. He said that by strengthening cooperation and fraternal assistance among socialist countries, we will be able to move forward faster. We, like other socialist countries and fraternal parties, regard strengthening the solidarity of the socialist camp and the revolutionary international workers' movement as our responsibility. This solidarity will shatter all provocations against socialism and communism by Western imperialism and modern revisionism.

    Aidit, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, said in his congratulatory speech to the Congress that the Indonesian communists realized from the very beginning that the Soviet Union's assistance to Hungary in crushing the counter-revolutionary riots was a concrete manifestation of the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

    Aidit said that in the newly independent Asian and African countries, the national bourgeoisie plays a leading role in the government. The imperialists are trying to steer its development in a right-leaning direction. But in Indonesia, this right-leaning development direction is restricted. Because the progressive forces are quite strong, and cooperate with the revolutionary national forces led by President Sukarno on many issues. However, we cannot underestimate the right wing of the national bourgeoisie.

    Aidit said that the imperialists are taking advantage of the fact that the national bourgeoisie fears the victory of the revolutionary movement under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, and are fully supporting the bourgeoisie's policy of reducing the people's democratic rights, in an attempt to change the balance of power in Indonesia. The imperialists are also cunningly using the national bourgeoisie's fear of the powerful People's Republic of China for the purpose of their "anti-communist strategy" and undermining Asian-African solidarity.

    Aidit emphasized that the Indonesian people are determined to defend democracy, and for this reason, all conspiracies of US imperialism and domestic reactionary forces should be crushed. The Indonesian people are deeply convinced that even the worst democratic system is better than military dictatorship or personal dictatorship. The Indonesian Communist Party is leading the struggle for the people's democratic rights, leading the struggle to defend the friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people, the people of other Asian and African countries, and the people of the world. This is our answer to the heinous "strategy" of the US imperialists.

    Bodnaras, head of the delegation of the Romanian Workers' Party and member of the Central Political Bureau, delivered a congratulatory speech, saying that our people, together with all peace-loving people in the world, are struggling to ease international tensions and achieve peaceful coexistence. The Romanian government has always done its utmost to promote mutual understanding among the Balkan countries and to make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Our people fully support Khrushchev's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament at the United Nations.

    Loga-Sowinski, head of the delegation of the Polish United Workers' Party and member of the Central Political Bureau, said in his speech at the meeting that the unbreakable unity of the socialist countries is the guarantee for the socialist system to defeat the capitalist system. He said that Marxism-Leninism is the unshakable foundation of our Party's activities. In the future, we will continue to be vigilant against revisionism at all times.

    Fainber, head of the delegation of the Austrian Communist Party and First Secretary of the Central Committee, also gave a congratulatory speech to the Congress.

    The speeches of the fraternal parties were warmly welcomed by the audience.

    Also speaking at the morning meeting today were: Cinede Lajos, First Secretary of the Szolnok County Party Committee, as well as representatives from the Kabor Iron and Steel Plant, Becs City, and Zala County.

    During the meeting, representatives of the Hungarian Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers congratulated the Congress. They presented flowers to the Presidium of the Congress and the representatives of the fraternal parties attending the meeting, and also reported to the Congress the good news that the national youth had overfulfilled the production guarantees put forward to welcome the Party Congress.

    The morning meeting ended here.

    明尼赫、奥普罗和卡拉伊在匈牙利党代会上发言
    今年将提前实现三年计划主要指标
    九个兄弟党代表致词祝贺匈牙利人民的成就
    新华社布达佩斯1日电　在匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会1日的会议上，开始讨论卡达尔和福克所作的报告。
    社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、工农革命政府总理明尼赫，就国家和经济领导工作发了言。明尼赫说，匈牙利工农革命政府一开始，就把树立集体领导和建立集体领导的形式作为活动的主要原则之一。他说，政府工作的方向是正确的。它在执行党的政策方面，基本上很好地完成了任务。明尼赫说，在国民经济领导方面，我们采取了一系列的措施。各级地方议会在满足居民的经济、社会福利和文化需要等方面作了很大努力，过去三年在行政和经济领导中广泛吸收劳动人民参加，是我们胜利的主要因素之一。今后将更加广泛和深入地加强同群众的联系。
    社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、工农革命政府第一副总理奥普罗在发言中谈到了居民的商品供应、对外贸易和社会主义国家经济合作问题。他指出，只有不断增加生产和提高劳动生产率才能持久地保证人民生活水平的提高。今年，匈牙利的工农业生产就能达到三年计划所规定的1960年的主要指标，所以职工的实际收入和商品零售额的增长也超过了三年计划所规定的指标。最近三年内，国家建筑和国家贷款给私人建筑的住宅共达十万七千套。从反革命事变到目前为止，居民的存款增长了三十三亿福林，即增长了五倍多。居民的商品供应不论在城市或乡村都很良好。奥普罗说，在实现第二个五年计划的指标方面，对外贸易和同社会主义国家之间的紧密合作有着特别的意义。他说，我们同世界上大多数的国家进行贸易。同社会主义国家之间的贸易额占匈牙利对外贸易额的四分之三左右。现在匈牙利的国际支付是平衡的。奥普罗说，今后，匈牙利将进一步发展同兄弟国家的经济互助合作关系。
    匈牙利妇女全国委员会主席埃尔德，贝克什州党委会第一书记克劳科，萨伯尔齐—沙特马尔州党委会第一书记本凯和吉厄尔—索普伦州党委会第一书记朗博什等也在1日的会议上发了言。
    在1日的会议上，法国、意大利和摩洛哥的兄弟党的代表也先后致了词。
    法国共产党中央政治局委员、书记处书记杜克洛指出，1956年的匈牙利反革命事件不仅是匈牙利的事件，同时也是一个国际事件，它在国际上引起了反苏反共的逆流。法国反动集团也乘机向法共进攻，但是法国人民坚决支持了匈牙利人民的正义斗争，全国有五十多个城市举行了反帝游行示威。杜克洛在发言中祝贺匈牙利人民在社会主义建设方面取得的巨大成绩。杜克洛还说，法国人民非常欢迎赫鲁晓夫访问法国，这表明了法国人民对苏联的友好。杜克洛说，法国人民一致要求法国政府同阿尔及利亚政府立即开始谈判。杜克洛并谴责法国政府不顾世界人民的反对坚持在撒哈拉进行原子武器试验。杜克洛最后说，法国共产党在人民中的威信日益增长，广大人民清楚地看到，法国共产党是真正为人民利益而斗争的。法国共产党坚持马克思列宁主义的原则，始终不渝地为世界共产主义运动的胜利而奋斗。
   意大利共产党中央政治局委员巴叶塔在致词时赞扬了匈牙利人民粉碎1956年反革命暴乱的胜利。他说，意大利共产党员现在正在进行着两条战线的斗争，即一面反对修正主义，一面反对宗派主义和教条主义。他说，反动派扬言要埋葬意大利共产党，但是，由于党的正确政策，有愈来愈多的新的力量支持着我们。
    摩洛哥共产党中央书记处第一书记阿里·亚塔致词时说，你们消灭了反革命叛乱不仅在你们国内拯救了无产阶级专政，而且大大鼓舞了民族解放斗争，并有助于和平事业。你们的胜利证明：帝国主义者无法使历史车轮倒转。
    阿里·亚塔说，摩洛哥政府宣布摩洛哥共产党为非法的行为，激起了摩洛哥人民的反对。他指出，摩洛哥虽然独立了，但外国军队还驻在它的领土上。他说，我们要求法国和西班牙的军队撤出摩洛哥，要求取消美国在摩洛哥的军事基地。
    兄弟党代表们的致词，受到了热烈的欢迎。
    新华社布达佩斯2日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会2日上午继续开会，讨论卡达尔和福克的报告。
    大会首先听取并通过了资格审查委员会的报告。
    接着，匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记卡拉伊·久洛就思想革命和文化革命问题发了言。
    卡拉伊在发言中分析了匈牙利解放以来思想和文化革命的发展情况。他指出，最近三年来，社会主义工人党在同反革命的斗争中，坚决地捍卫了马克思列宁主义，粉碎了形形色色的资产阶级敌对观点和修正主义的猖狂进攻。
    卡拉伊说，目前，资产阶级思想还在广大群众中存在，起着作用。这不仅是在一些人的头脑中，而且还表现在日常生活中，在科学、文学、艺术领域中。我们必须加强政治宣传教育工作，揭露那些敌对的和错误的观点，并在原则斗争和思想斗争中清算它们。
    卡拉伊说，社会主义建设要求加速对群众思想意识的社会主义改造，必须在比较短的时间内使社会主义道德、社会主义劳动态度和爱国主义在最广大的群众阶层中扎下根。这是我们在经过一段不长的历史时期后，过渡到共产主义建设的思想条件。
    卡拉伊指出，在国际上，和平共处并不意味着原则和政治上的妥协，也不是思想上的共处，而是要进行公开和尖锐的思想斗争。在和平共处时期，必须加强反对一切资产阶级思想表现的斗争。
    卡拉伊强调说，为了完成上述任务，党必须加强思想和文化工作，使其成为全党工作的有机组成部分。他又说，党在社会主义建设中所起的领导作用要求每个党员都要学习、提高业务和知识水平。他说，中国的口号“红与专”在我们这里也是有效的。
    卡拉伊说，今天修正主义的残余还不少。在社会科学中还是主要的危险。这种潜伏的修正主义虽然失去了公开的讲台，但是它们在科学界和新闻界仍然以隐蔽的形式，进行防御性的战斗，在寻找适应于新条件的表现形式。在文学研究方面也有些人企图复活“为艺术而艺术”的文学。今天已经不应该只是泛泛地进行反对修正主义的斗争。应该对具体的历史、经济、哲学、文学等问题进行马克思主义的观察和分析，使我们的社会科学摆脱修正主义的束缚。应该加强思想的纯洁性和共产主义的党性。
    卡拉伊在谈到党对知识分子的政策时说，我们对知识分子的政策在生活中被证明是正确的。知识分子接受了党的政策，并且为实现这一政策而工作。他说，但是大部分知识分子还没有建立起马克思列宁主义的世界观。我们希望他们加强思想改造，为劳动人民服务。
    在卡拉伊发言后，德国统一社会党代表团团长、中央委员会第一书记乌布利希向大会致祝词。他在谈到1956年匈牙利反革命事件时说，这一事件给德意志民主共和国的工人上了一次大课。他又说，纳吉·伊姆雷从一个机会主义者变成了祖国的叛徒，这清楚地表明，修正主义将导向何处。
    乌布利希指出，德意志民主共和国的居民、西柏林的居民和西德爱好和平的力量，特别希望召开政府首脑会议，以便能在德国消除希特勒战争的后果，结束“冷战”和签订和约。
    接着，捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团团长、捷共中央政治局委员巴契列克向大会致祝词。他说，加强社会主义国家间的合作和兄弟般的帮助，我们就能够更快地向前迈进。我们同其他社会主义国家和兄弟党一样，把加强社会主义阵营和革命的国际工人运动的团结，看作是自己的责任。这种团结将粉碎西方帝国主义和现代修正主义反对社会主义和共产主义的一切挑衅。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席艾地在向大会致祝词时说，印度尼西亚共产党人从一开始就认识到，苏联帮助匈牙利粉碎反革命暴乱是无产阶级国际主义精神的具体表现。
    艾地说，在重新取得独立的亚非各国，民族资产阶级在政府中起着领导作用。帝国主义者企图把其发展方向引向右倾。但在印度尼西亚，这个右倾的发展方向是受到限制的。因为进步力量相当强大，在很多问题上是同苏加诺总统领导的革命的民族力量进行合作的。但是，我们不能轻视民族资产阶级的右派。
    艾地说，帝国主义分子利用民族资产阶级畏惧在印度尼西亚共产党领导下的革命运动所取得的胜利这一点，全力支持资产阶级缩小人民的民主权利的政策，企图改变印度尼西亚的力量对比。帝国主义分子为了他们的“反共策略”和破坏亚非团结的目的，还在狡猾地利用民族资产阶级对强大的中华人民共和国的恐惧心理。
    艾地强调说，印度尼西亚人民坚决要保卫民主，为此应该粉碎美帝国主义和国内反动力量的一切阴谋。印度尼西亚人民深信，就是最坏的民主主义制度也比军事专制或个人独裁要好。印度尼西亚共产党领导着争取人民的民主权利的斗争，领导着捍卫印度尼西亚人民同中国人民、其他亚非国家人民和全世界人民的友谊的斗争，这就是我们对美帝国主义者罪恶的“战略”的回答。
    罗马尼亚工人党代表团团长、中央政治局委员波德纳拉希致祝词说，我国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为缓和国际紧张局势和实现和平共处而斗争。罗马尼亚政府一贯竭尽全力，争取巴尔干国家相互了解，使这一地区成为无原子武器和核武器地区。我国人民完全支持赫鲁晓夫在联合国提出的全面彻底裁军的建议。
    波兰统一工人党代表团团长、中央政治局委员洛加—索文斯基在会上致词说，社会主义各国的牢不可破的团结是社会主义制度战胜资本主义制度的保证。他说，马克思列宁主义是我们党的活动的不可动摇的基础。今后我们仍将时刻警惕修正主义。
    奥地利共产党代表团团长、中央委员会第一书记费恩伯也向大会致了祝词。
    各兄弟党的致词受到了全场的热烈欢迎。
    在今天上午会议上发言的还有：索尔诺克州党委第一书记齐内杰·拉约什，以及卡博尔铸铁厂、贝奇市和佐洛州的代表。
    在会议进行期间，匈牙利共产主义青年团和少先队代表到大会祝贺。他们向大会主席团和参加会议的各兄弟党的代表献了花，并且还向大会报告了全国青少年超额实现迎接党代会所提出的生产保证的喜讯。
    上午会议到此结束。
