Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, December 20th: According to Argentinian newspapers, Paraguayan anti-dictatorial armed forces are actively carrying out guerrilla activities. Fighting has occurred in San Estanislao, 150 kilometers from the capital Asuncion, and in General Artigas, 75 kilometers from Asuncion. Battles are also continuing in three places near the Brazilian border: Hernandarias, Caaguazu, and Itaquia.

According to members of the Paraguayan National Liberation United Front here, one team of insurgents attacked a patrol near the town of Yuti in the Sapa area, seizing weapons and ammunition; another team attacked a police patrol on the highway from Machiel to Sapa, capturing some personnel and seizing some guns. Both teams successfully retreated to their bases in the forest after the attacks. According to a report in "La Prensa" today, Stroessner's troops arrested 300 members of the Liberal Party and February Party living in Puerto Elsa and Benetrette last Monday, 22 of whom were shot in the town of Colonia Falcón. According to travelers from Asuncion, Stroessner's armed militia continues to arrest members of the opposition on the streets of Asuncion. Nearly 600 prisoners have recently been arrested and are being held in the town of Bahia Negra. According to "La Razón", Stroessner has established a Nazi-style concentration camp there.

Exiles from the Paraguayan National Liberation United Front held another demonstration here last night, demanding in a statement to "La Prensa" that the dictatorial government immediately release the arrested political prisoners and imprisoned workers and students.

　　巴拉圭反独裁武装四处出击
    独裁政权加紧恐怖活动到处搜捕反对派
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯20日电  据阿根廷报纸报道，巴拉圭反独裁武装部队正积极展开游击活动。在离首都亚松森一百五十公里的圣埃斯塔尼斯劳和离亚松森七十五公里的赫内拉耳阿蒂加斯都发生了战斗。在靠近巴西边境的埃尔南达里亚斯、卡瓜苏和伊塔基亚等三个地方的战斗也在继续中。
    据巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线的人员在这里说，一队起义人员在萨帕地区的尤蒂镇附近袭击巡逻队，缴获了武器和弹药；另一队在从马谢耳通向萨帕的公路上袭击了警察巡逻队，俘虏了一些人员并缴获了一些枪支。两队人员在进行袭击以后顺利撤回他们在森林中的根据地。据“新闻报”今天报道，斯特罗斯纳军队在上星期一逮捕了三百名居住在埃耳萨港和贝特雷特两地的自由党人和二月党人，其中有二十二人在哥隆尼亚法耳孔镇被枪杀。据从亚松森来的旅客说，斯特罗斯纳的武装民兵在亚松森大街上继续逮捕反对派的成员。最近被捕的将近六百名犯人都被关在巴希亚内格拉镇。据“理性报”报道，斯特罗斯纳在那里设立了一个纳粹式的集中营。
    巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线的流亡者昨晚在这里再次示威游行，他们在对“新闻报”发表的宣言中要求独裁政府立即释放被捕的政治犯和被监禁的工人和学生。
