　　Did you know?
    The earliest country in the world to implement mechanized grain harvesting was ancient Rome, two thousand years ago.
    The harvester was a two-wheeled vehicle. It was pushed by oxen from behind, and the front edge of the vehicle was fitted with a metal comb. The metal comb "combed" the ears of grain off, which then fell into a box.
    Obviously, under the labor conditions of the slave system, it was impossible to seriously pursue mechanization. Therefore, this grain harvester was later lost. But strangely, at the beginning of the twentieth century, a combine harvester was seen in Australia, which abandoned the device for cutting crops and replaced it with a comb-like device similar to the ancient Roman one.

　　你知道吗？
    世界上最早实行粮食收割机械化的，是在两千年前的古罗马。
    收割机是辆两轮车。车后有牛推动，车前边缘处装设着一个金属梳，金属梳将稻穗“梳”下后倾入箱中。
    显然，在奴隶制度的劳动条件下，不可能认真讲求机械化。因此这架粮食收割机后来就失传了。但是奇怪的是，二十世纪初叶在澳大利亚竟见到有一种康拜因机，其中废去切割农作物的装置而代之以古罗马装置似的梳妆器械。
