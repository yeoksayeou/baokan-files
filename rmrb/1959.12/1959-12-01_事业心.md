　　Drive for Progress

　　Pigs are trained to obey human commands: eating food in a designated order, and after finishing the fixed amount, the feeder taps the feeding trough a few times with a mallet, and with a shout, the pigs turn around and return to the pen; in winter, the pigs can obey commands to sleep in opposite directions to keep each other warm... Why can pigs live such an orderly life? How much hard work did the feeder put in to achieve this!

　　In our era, there are thousands upon thousands of heroic model figures who have created amazing miracles in the most ordinary of jobs. Although their work posts are different, they all have one thing in common, that is, they love their work and spare no effort to dedicate all their energy to the people's cause. The comrades of the pig farm of Zhonglianchuan Production Team in Gongjing Commune are such people. In their pig-raising endeavor, they racked their brains and created a set of scientific feeding management methods. In three years, the number of pigs increased from sixty to five thousand two hundred and forty-three, an increase of eighty-six times.

　　Glory to you, comrades feeders!

    事业心
    把猪驯服得听从人的指挥：定位按序吃食，吃完定量以后，饲养员把拌食的榔头在食槽上敲几下，随声一喊，猪就转身回圈；冬天，猪能够听从命令颠倒睡觉，以便相互取暖……。猪为什么能够生活得这样有秩序？做到这一点，饲养员付出了多少辛勤的劳动！
    在我们的时代里，有千千万万的英雄模范人物，他们在最平凡的工作中创造了惊人的奇迹。尽管他们的工作岗位不同，但是都有一个共同的特点，那就是热爱自己的工作，为人民的事业毫不吝惜地献出全副精力。贡井公社中连川生产队养猪场的同志们，就是这样的一些人，他们在养猪事业中，绞尽了脑汁，创造出一套科学的饲养管理办法，三年中猪由六十头发展到五千二百四十三头，增加了八十六倍。
    光荣呵！饲养员同志们。
