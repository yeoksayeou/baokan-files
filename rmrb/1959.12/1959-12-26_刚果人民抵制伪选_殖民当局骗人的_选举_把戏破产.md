Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, December 22nd: The Belgian Communist newspaper "Red Flag" stated in an editorial today that the recent "local elections" held in the Congo were "a painful failure" for the Belgian authorities. The newspaper said that the situation in the "elections" showed "the decisive influence of the parties that support immediate independence."

News received here indicates that the Congolese people massively boycotted the "local elections" arranged by the Belgian authorities on the 20th. In the capital, Leopoldville, more than 70% of residents responded to the ABAKO party's call to boycott the "elections" and did not vote. The colonial governor of Leopoldville Province, Bowman, admitted that due to the ABAKO party's boycott, many areas of Leopoldville Province did not hold "elections" on the 20th. It is reported that out of 12,000 residents in Matadi Port, only 3% were forced to vote. In the Falls area, there was not even a single candidate.

In Stanleyville in the northeast, the colonial authorities, who recently carried out bloody suppression there, arrested two local leaders of the Congolese National Movement Party and some Congolese youth on the 20th for boycotting the "elections." Those who did go to vote mostly voted for the Congolese National Movement Party (Lumumba faction), which demands independence. It is reported that this party won sixteen out of seventeen seats in one district of Stanleyville.

　　刚果人民抵制伪选
    殖民当局骗人的“选举”把戏破产
    据新华社布鲁塞尔22日电　比利时共产党报纸“红旗报”今天在社论中指出，对比利时当局说来，最近在刚果举行的“地方选举”是“一个痛苦的失败”。这家报纸说，“选举”中的情况显示了“支持立即独立的各政党的决定性影响”。
    这里收到的消息表明，刚果人民在20日大规模地抵制了比利时当局安排在那天举行的“地方选举”。在首府利奥波德维尔，有70％以上的居民响应阿巴科党抵制这次“选举”的号召，没有去投票。利奥波德维尔省的殖民总督鲍曼承认，因为阿巴科党进行抵制，利奥波德维尔省许多地区在20日没有举行“选举”。据报道，在马塔迪港的一万二千居民中，只有3％的人被迫投了票。在瀑布区，甚至连一个候选人也没有。
    在东北部的斯坦利维尔，不久前在那里进行血腥镇压的殖民当局，20日逮捕了抵制“选举”的刚果民族运动党的两位地方领袖和一些刚果青年。而去参加投票的，大多数投了要求独立的刚果民族运动党（卢蒙巴派）的票。据报道，这个党在斯坦利维尔的一个区就获得了十七席中的十六席。
