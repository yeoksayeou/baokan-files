    Three Mistakes of "Closing the Door to Reflect on One's Mistakes"
    Mo Guiru
    Idioms originating from the term "closing the door," which we often hear, include "closing the door to build a cart," "closing the door to read books," and "closing the door to reflect on one's mistakes," etc. Although their specific meanings vary, their fundamental spirit is consistent: detachment from reality, detachment from the masses, detachment from political struggle, and emphasis on individual action, nothing more. Intellectuals in the past greatly appreciated these idioms, even considering them their mottoes, likely for these very reasons. The lingering poison continues to circulate and has not yet been thoroughly eradicated.
    Over the past ten years, with the rise of the proletariat and the elimination of capitalism, and repeated demolition and construction, intellectuals have understood the truth that closing the door to build a cart inevitably leads to misalignment, and closing the door to read books results in useless learning. They no longer believe in phrases like "closing the door..." Only "closing the door to reflect on one's mistakes" is still favored by a minority. Whenever an ideological remolding movement arrives, there are always some comrades who are unwilling to open the door of their minds, bring out their mistakes, and openly break with them. Instead, they spend their days plotting a "secretly reform" scheme, sealing their true thoughts layer upon layer, single-mindedly wanting to take the old path of "closing the door to reflect on one's mistakes." It is said that this is based on two considerations: first, revealing mistakes would be embarrassing; second, "secretly" and openly exposing them are just different methods, and both can achieve the goal of "reforming." The idea is indeed ingenious, but the outcome may not be so.
    Correcting mistakes is like treating an illness. To correct mistakes without wanting to expose them is like treating an illness without revealing the symptoms. Logically, how can this make sense! Committing mistakes proves that there are problems in one's ideology and stance. The only way is to expose them, analyze and criticize them oneself, and at the same time, ask the Party and the masses to help analyze and criticize them, dig out the root of the mistakes, point out the nature of the mistakes, thereby raising awareness and resolving to correct them. Otherwise, going it alone, fighting disease with an unhealthy body, is bound to be weak. Therefore, "closing the door to reflect on one's mistakes" definitely cannot be deeply thought through; "secretly reforming" definitely cannot be thoroughly reformed. If, during the process of reflection, one gets into a dead end, unable to understand after much thought, wouldn't that be wasted effort? Even worse, the more one thinks, the more confused one becomes, becoming a prisoner of erroneous thoughts, sinking deeper into the mire of bourgeois ideology, which would be counterproductive.
    The style of a revolutionary cadre should be upright and honest, with a broad mind. Frankly exposing and openly criticizing proves one's ability to bow to the truth and willingness to dedicate oneself to the revolution. Being overly concerned with gains and losses and covering up such a decent behavior, isn't that individualism at play? During the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, some comrades made mistakes, and tracing their roots, it was often bourgeois ideology at play, unwilling to speak from the standpoint of the interests of the Party and the masses. Now, when correcting mistakes, they are repeating the same mistake, not listening to the Party's admonition, exposing mistakes, and raising awareness, thinking that they can "secretly reform" without the help of the Party and the masses. This really makes one wonder: do these comrades really have the sincerity to correct their mistakes? No matter what basis the "secretly reform" proposal is put forward on, it is actually deceiving oneself. The so-called "closing the door to reflect on one's mistakes" is equivalent to giving socialist thought the cold shoulder; the so-called "secretly reforming" is equivalent to rejecting the criticism of the Party and the masses from afar. In short, the "secretly reform" proposal itself has three major mistakes. Not being brave enough to admit mistakes, not seriously correcting mistakes, that is the first mistake; not believing in the Party, not believing in the masses, that is the second mistake; not telling the Party the truth, not being loyal and honest, that is the third mistake. Old mistakes not removed, new mistakes added, how can "secretly reforming" be discussed?!
    We do not oppose "reflecting on one's mistakes," but rather advocate "reflecting on one's mistakes," and promote "reflecting on one's mistakes." However, there is one condition: reflecting on one's mistakes must be done with the door open, and self-criticism must be combined with mutual criticism, thoroughly exposing erroneous words and deeds and erroneous thoughts, without any concealment, finding the crux of the problem, prescribing the remedy, and continuously transforming one's ideology and stance under collective supervision. This is like treating an illness, paying attention to exercise, being careful about daily life, which are certainly important, but once bedridden, the main thing is to get injections and take medicine, relying on the doctor. Opening the door of one's soul wide, letting the sunshine of socialist thought shine directly in, is really the top priority for some comrades. (Originally published in Anhui Daily)

### “闭门思过”三错

    “闭门思过”三错
    莫圭如
    从“闭门”这个词儿产生的成语，经常听到的就有“闭门造车”、“闭门读书”、“闭门思过”等等，具体含义固然各有不同，基本精神则是一致的，那就是脱离实际，脱离群众，脱离政治斗争，强调个人作用，如此而已。从前的知识分子很欣赏这些成语，甚至奉之为座右铭，恐怕也就是这些原因。遗毒流传，至今尚未彻底肃清。
    十年来，兴无灭资，几番破立，知识分子懂得了闭门造车必不合辙、闭门读书学而无用的道理，再也不相信“闭门……”之类的话了。唯独“闭门思过”，尚为少数人所宠爱，每逢思想改造运动到来，总有那么一些同志不愿打开思想大门，搬出错误，公开决裂，而是成天打着“偷偷改”的小算盘，内一层外一层，层层密封思想真象，一心一意要走“闭门思过”的老路。据说所以如此，出于两种考虑，其一，搬出错误，有失体面；其二，“偷偷”与暴露，只是方法不同，同样能达到“改”的目的。想法确实很妙，只怕结果未必如此。
    改错等于治病。改错而不愿暴露错误，等于治病不讲出病情，在逻辑上，这怎么能说得通！犯了错误，证明思想上、立场上有毛病，唯一的办法是暴露出来，自己分析批判，同时请党和群众帮助自己分析批判，挖出错误的根源，指出错误的性质，从而提高认识，决心改错，否则，单枪匹马，以不健康的身体去和疾病作斗争，未免力量单薄，所以，“闭门思过”，肯定不能思得深透；“偷偷地改”，肯定不能改得彻底。倘若在思的过程中，一旦钻进牛角尖，百思不解，岂不劳而无功？甚至，越想越不通，做了错误思想的俘虏，在资产阶级思想的泥坑里，深陷一步，这就适得其反了。
    一个革命干部的风格，应该光明正大，胸怀磊落。坦率暴露，公开批判，证明能向真理低头，愿意献身革命，对于这种体面的行为，反而患得患失，遮遮掩掩，不是个人主义在作怪又是什么？在大跃进的高潮中，有些同志犯了错误，穷其根源，常常是资产阶级的思想在作怪，不愿站在党和群众利益的立场上说话。如今改错，又重蹈复辙，不听党的忠告，暴露错误，提高认识，以为不要党和群众的帮助，也能“偷偷改”正。这实在令人怀疑：这些同志究竟有无改错的诚意？不管“偷偷改”的主张是在什么基础上提出来的，实际上是自欺欺人。所谓“闭门思过”，等于让社会主义思想吃闭门羹；所谓“偷偷地改”，等于拒党和群众的批评于千里之外。总而言之，“偷偷改”的主张，本身有三大错。不勇于认错，不认真改错，其错一也；不相信党，不相信群众，其错二也；对党不说真心话，不忠诚老实，其错三也。旧错未除，新错又添，“偷偷改”错，从何谈起！？
    我们并不反对“思过”，而且主张“思过”，提倡“思过”。不过有一条，思过要开门，自我批评要和相互批评结合起来，彻底暴露错误言行和错误思想，毫无埋伏，找出症结，开出药方，并在集体的监督下，不断改造思想和立场。这好比治病，注意锻炼，留心起居，固属重要，但是一旦卧病在床，更主要的还是打针吃药，依靠医生。大开心灵的大门，让社会主义思想的阳光直射进来，对于一些同志来说，实在是当务之急。　（原载安徽日报）
