Zibo in One Year

Since implementing the policy of "walking on two legs," in Zibo City, Shandong Province, hundreds of small and medium-sized factories, including those in heavy industry, light industry, and the chemical industry, have sprung up everywhere. Currently, this city has transformed from being able to only produce single products such as coal and coarse ceramics in the early days of liberation to a comprehensive industrial city capable of producing pig iron, alumina, silicon carbide, silicon carbon rods, motors, high-alumina refractory bricks, fine ceramics, as well as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and other chemical products.

Zibo City is a famous "treasure land" with extremely rich deposits of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the guidance of the policy of "taking steel as the key link," Zibo City has established 55 medium-sized factories in just one year.

After vigorously developing the iron and steel industry, 150,000 tons of first-class iron were produced in just over four months, supporting steel mills in Shanghai and other places. After "two transformations" and "five fixings," the city currently has 20 regular iron smelting plants and workshops. In the first ten months of this year, over 158,000 tons of qualified iron have been transferred to Shanghai and other places.

The development of the iron and steel industry has greatly promoted the development of mining, coking, and refractory materials industries. Previously, there was only one iron mine here, but last year eight were established, with a daily output of more than 8,000 tons of ore. After the 46 simple No. 2 coke ovens built this year were put into production, the annual output of coke can reach 700,000 tons. Zibo City has rich deposits of diaspore and bauxite. In order to support the continued Great Leap Forward in the national steel industry, the city vigorously expanded and built several bauxite mines and refractory materials factories, providing a sufficient supply of refractory bricks and refractory raw materials to Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel, Chongqing Iron and Steel, and dozens of key metallurgical enterprises in Hebei, Jilin, Shanghai, and other places. Now, the refractory materials industry here is developing towards manufacturing high-grade products such as special-shaped bricks, in order to further meet the needs of various parts of the country.

In terms of coal production, Zibo City opened more than 100 small coal pits last year. Currently, the more than 80 small coal pits that have been rectified have a daily output of about 4,000 tons, which is equal to the total output of all modern coal mines in the city in 1949.

In terms of the machinery industry, Zibo City had only more than 20 lathes in the early days of liberation. Now the city has more than 1,180 various types of lathes. The AC motors produced here are sold all over the country.

While vigorously developing heavy industry, Zibo City has also paid attention to developing light industry that serves the people's lives. The calcium gluconate, barbital, amytal and other drugs manufactured by Zibo Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory also enjoy a high reputation in the international market.

At present, the total number of employees in factories and mines throughout the city has increased sharply from more than 50,000 in the early days of liberation to more than 200,000; the total industrial output value will increase 14 times this year compared to 1949.

    淄博一年间
    山东淄博市贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针后，几百个包括重工业、轻工业、化学工业的中小型工厂遍地开花。目前，这个市已经由解放初期只能生产煤、粗陶瓷等单一产品，一变而为能够生产生铁、铝氧、金钢砂、矽炭棒、电机、高铝耐火砖、细陶瓷及农药、医药和其他化工产品的综合工业城市。
    淄博市是有名的“宝地”，黑色、有色金属等矿藏极为丰富。大跃进以来，淄博市在“以钢为纲”的方针指导下，一年之间，就办起了中型工厂五十五座。
    大办钢铁以后在短短四个多月的时间里，就炼出了十五万吨一类铁，支援了上海等地的炼钢厂。经过了“两化”“五定”，目前全市已有二十个正规的炼铁厂和车间，今年头十个月已调给上海等地十五万八千多吨合格铁。
    钢铁工业的发展又大大促进了采矿、炼焦，耐火材料等工业的发展。以前这里只有一个铁矿，去年一下就办起了八个，日产矿石八千多吨。今年兴建的四十六座二号简易焦炉投入生产后，年产焦炭可达七十万吨。淄博市蕴藏着丰富的焦宝石和铝矾土。为了支援全国钢铁工业的继续跃进，这个市曾大力扩建和新建了好几个铝矾土矿、耐火材料厂，使鞍钢、武钢、石钢、重钢及河北、吉林、上海等几十个重点冶金企业的耐火砖和耐火原料，得到了充足的供应。现在，这里的耐火材料工业，正在向制造异型砖等高级产品方向发展，以进一步满足全国各地的需要。
    在煤炭生产方面，去年淄博市开办了一百多座小煤井，目前经过整顿的八十几个小煤井，日产量在四千吨左右，等于1949年全市所有现代化煤矿的总产量。
    机械工业方面，解放初期淄博市只有二十多部车床。现在全市已拥有一千一百八十多部各式车床。这里生产的交流电动机已遍销全国。
    在大办重工业的同时，淄博市也注意发展了为人民生活服务的轻工业。淄博市新华制药厂制造的葡萄糖酸钙，巴比妥、阿米妥等药品，在国际市场上也享有盛誉。
    现在，全市厂矿企业的职工总人数已从解放初期的五万多人，剧增到二十多万名；工业总产值今年将比1949年增长十四倍。
