Xinhua News Agency Report: Zhejiang's people's communes are carrying out kitchen technology innovation in their public canteens, and have created and promoted a large number of new cooking tools.

The province-saving and firewood-saving "All-Purpose Stove" is being widely promoted in all counties of the province. The "All-Purpose Stove" was first created by the Meihua Canteen of the Wudongzha People's Commune in Cixi County. After this canteen used the "All-Purpose Stove," the number of cooks was reduced from seven to three, and it only took about three and a half hours to cook three meals a day, while in the past it took three hours to cook one meal with an earthen stove. Now, more than 7,700 canteens in the province use "All-Purpose Stoves" to cook rice and vegetables, and many collective livestock farms have also built "All-Purpose Stoves," which has doubled the efficiency of cooks and breeders, saving a large amount of labor for agricultural production. The Jinhua Special District manufactured and promoted a large number of new cooking tools such as vegetable cutters, slicers, and shredders. More than 300 canteens in the entire special district have achieved simple mechanization and semi-mechanization of kitchen utensils, and work efficiency has generally increased by more than five times.

Many canteens in the mountainous and semi-mountainous communes of Jinhua, Ningbo, Jiaxing, and other special districts also used bamboo to make their own simple tap water systems, so cooks no longer have to carry water from rivers and wells all day long. After more than 100 canteens in the Xinxiao Commune in Lishui County universally used simple tap water pipes erected with bamboo, they saved more than 100 people who were needed to fetch water. Many canteens also installed filter tanks in the simple tap water systems to eat clean filtered water.

Canteens in various places are carrying out labor competitions with kitchen technology innovation as the content to make the canteens better and the commune members more satisfied. Some commune members who originally cooked their own meals have recently joined the canteens. After the communes in Anji County promoted more than 100 "All-Purpose Stoves," a large number of vegetable cutters, and more than 500 simple tap water systems, the work of the canteens was significantly improved, and the number of commune members participating in the canteens rapidly increased to 92.6% of the total number of commune households. Many production teams have 100% of their commune members eating in the canteens. At present, more than 90% of the total number of commune households in the province are eating in the canteens.

Xinhua News Agency Report: Shandong Province has launched a mass movement to reform cooking tools. Heze, Jinan, Zibo, Yantai, Linyi and other special districts and cities have reformed, created, and promoted more than 150,000 pieces of cooking equipment. In the Yantai Special District, which is progressing faster, more than 3,500 of the 19,000 canteens have realized the improvement and semi-mechanization of major cooking utensils.

Shandong has implemented the principles of "mainly indigenous methods, a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, adapting to local conditions, and self-reliance" to reform cooking tools. Xiaozhai Production Team of Chengyang Commune has electricity, so it transformed stone mills for grinding starch, sweet potato choppers, etc., to be driven by electricity. Haiyang County has less electromechanical power, so it transformed old stone mills into capstan mills, which also increased work efficiency by more than two times. In the installation of tap water, some areas had pipe materials and used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods; some areas did not have pipe materials and used galvanized iron pipes, bamboo pipes, etc. instead. Linyi area eats pancakes, so it transformed the old stoves into rotary stoves, which increased work efficiency by three or four times and greatly saved firewood. Yantai area eats窝窝(wōwō – a type of corn bread), so it is seizing the opportunity to reform dough mixers, 窝窝 machines, and steamers.

The large-scale reform and promotion of cooking tools has greatly saved manpower and animal power. Liangshan County created and imitated 19 types of tools, 4,243 pieces in total, which can save more than 30,000 labor days per day. After the Yangting Commune in Weihai City fully promoted capstan mills, one person and one animal could grind from 60 jin to 200 jin of flour per day, saving 210 man-days and 180 animal-days per day. The canteen of the Baishabu First Production Team of the Chashan Commune in Linyi City has 596 people eating. Originally, 65 cooks worked from morning till night, and the food supply was still not timely. After reforming tools such as stone mills, vegetable cutters, steamers, rotary stoves, and seven-star stoves, only 25 cooks were needed to ensure that the food was timely, and that coarse grains were refined, so that the commune members could eat hot and good food.

Xinhua News Agency Report: The public canteens of the people's communes in Shanxi Province have made great achievements in reforming cooking tools. In the Jin Southeast Special District, of the more than 15,000 rural public canteens, more than 4,500 canteens have realized simple mechanization of cooking. In the Jin North Special District, 20% to 30% of the canteens have basically realized the power-driven grinding of grains. In the Jin Central Special District, 40% of the canteens in various counties and cities have begun to use mechanical grinding. Various places have also recently created and promoted more than 100 new cooking utensils such as dough mixers, noodle pressing machines, noodle shaving machines, vegetable cutters, meat grinders, and filling mixers. Many canteens have also installed simple tap water systems.

The various cooking tools created and promoted in Shanxi Province generally meet the requirements of simple manufacture, convenient operation, low cost, good quality, high efficiency, and great effect. They not only reduce the labor intensity of cooks, improve work efficiency and food quality, and consolidate and improve public canteens, but also save a large amount of labor to participate in agricultural production. For example, since the Jin North Special District realized the mechanization of grain processing and grinding, it has saved 2.28 million man-days and more than 2 million animal-days. The Jin Southeast Special District has also freed up more than 6,000 people from the canteens to participate in agricultural production and water conservancy construction through the reform of cooking tools.

　　吃水不用挑　做饭用机械　磨面用动力
    改革炊具　办好食堂
    浙江山东山西节省大批劳力投入生产
    据新华社讯　浙江各地人民公社的公共食堂正在开展炊事技术革新工作，已经创造和推广了大批新式炊事工具。
    省工省柴的“万灵灶”，正在全省各县普遍推广。“万灵灶”是慈溪县五洞闸公社美化食堂首先创造出来的。这个食堂使用“万灵灶”后，炊事员由七人减少到三人，每天烧三餐饭只要三个半小时左右，而过去用土灶烧一餐饭就要三个小时。现在全省已有七千七百多个食堂用“万灵灶”煮饭和烧菜，很多集体畜牧场也建造了“万灵灶”，使炊事员、饲养员的工效成倍提高，节省出大批劳力投入农业生产。金华专区制造和推广了大量的切菜机、刨片机、刨丝机等新式炊事工具，全专区已有三百多个食堂实现了炊具简易机械化和半机械化，工效普遍提高五倍以上。
    金华、宁波、嘉兴等专区许多山区半山区公社的食堂，还利用毛竹自制土自来水，炊事员再不用一天到晚去河边井边挑水了。丽水县信孝公社一百多个食堂在普遍使用毛竹架设的土自来水管后，就节约了一百多个取水的人力。很多食堂还在土自来水中装设过滤缸，吃用清洁的过滤水。
    各地食堂以炊事技术革新为内容，开展劳动竞赛，使食堂办得更好，社员更加满意。一些原来自己烧饭的社员，最近也纷纷参加食堂。安吉县各公社推广一百多座“万灵灶”、大批切菜机和五百多处土自来水后，食堂工作有了显著改进，参加食堂的社员迅速增加到占社员总户数的92.6％，许多生产队百分之百社员参加食堂吃饭。目前全省在食堂吃饭的社员已占社员总户数90％以上。
    据新华社讯　山东省掀起群众性的炊事工具改革运动。菏泽、济南、淄博、烟台、临沂等专区、市已改革、创造和推广炊具十五万多件。进度较快的烟台专区，一万九千多个食堂中已有三千五百多个实现了主要炊事用具改良化和半机械化。
    山东各地都贯彻“以土为主，土洋结合，因地制宜，自力更生”的原则，改革炊事工具。城阳公社小寨生产队有电源，就把磨淀粉的石磨、剁地瓜机等改成用电力带动。海阳县机电动力少，就把旧石磨改造成绞关磨，工效也提高两倍多。在安装自来水中，有的地区有管材，就采用半土半洋；有的地区没有管材，就用白铁管、竹管等代替。临沂地区吃煎饼，就把旧熬子改成转盘熬子、工效提高三、四倍，还大大节约了柴草；烟台地区吃窝窝，就抓紧改革和面机、窝窝机和蒸笼等。
    大量改革和推广使用炊事工具，已经大大节省了人力和畜力。梁山县共创制仿造各种工具十九种四千二百四十三件，每天可节约劳动日三万多个。威海市羊亭公社全面推广绞关磨以后，一人一畜每天磨面由六十斤提高到二百斤，每天可节约二百一十个人工和一百八十个畜工。临沂市茶山公社白沙埠第一生产队的食堂有五百九十六人吃饭，原来六十五名炊事员起早带晚地干，饭菜供应还不及时，经过改革石磨、切菜机、蒸笼、转盘熬子、七星灶等工具后，只需二十五名炊事员就能做到饭菜及时，粗粮细作，使社员吃热吃好。
    据新华社讯　山西省各地人民公社的公共食堂改革炊事工具取得很大成绩。晋东南专区一万五千多个农村公共食堂中，已有四千五百多个食堂的炊事工作实现了土机械化。晋北专区有20％到30％的食堂，已经基本实现了碾磨动力化。晋中专区各县市有40％的食堂开始用机械磨面。各地最近还创制和推广了合面机、压面机、削面机、切菜机、绞肉机、拌馅机等一百多种新炊具。还有不少食堂安装了土自来水。
    山西省各地创制和推广的各种炊事工具一般都符合制造简单，操作方便，成本低，质量好，效率高，作用大的要求。它们不仅减轻了炊事员的劳动强度，提高了工作效率和饭菜质量，使公共食堂得到巩固和提高，并且因此节省出大批劳力参加农业生产。例如，晋北专区在实现粮食加工碾磨化以来，已节省了二百二十八万个人工和二百多万个畜工；晋东南专区通过炊事工具改革也从食堂中腾出了六千多个人力参加农业生产和水利建设。（附图片）
