	The phrase "sharpening knives for pigs and sheep" comes from the famous Ballad of Mulan, describing how Mulan's younger brother generously slaughtered pigs and sheep to welcome his sister's triumphant return home. What a sumptuous feast it was! However, that was merely a family's joy. I am now going to tell a story about a factory celebrating its success by slaughtering pigs and sheep for its workers.

	Due to a business trip, I went to the Dalian Limestone Mine. While eating in the cafeteria, I saw a notice written on red paper, the gist of which was: In order to celebrate the limestone mine being named a national red banner unit, the Party committee has decided to slaughter two pigs and five sheep to celebrate. All the mine workers were overjoyed to eat the pigs and sheep raised by their own cafeteria, which was reflected in their greater enthusiasm in production.

	The Dalian Limestone Mine achieved outstanding results in the continuing Great Leap Forward of 1959 and won the glorious title of National Red Banner Unit. This is certainly a major event worth celebrating. In my opinion, the fact that the cafeteria can provide its own raised pigs and sheep to reward the workers is equally worthy of celebration.

	In the past, factories and enterprises were naturally consumers of agriculture. But now, factories can actually eat their own raised pigs and sheep, which is undoubtedly a fresh and gratifying thing.

	Of course, I am not advocating excessive eating and drinking, but rather advocating more production. The more we raise now, the more we can eat in the future. Raising pigs and sheep can also be done by everyone.

	From the newspapers, we can see that many urban industrial and mining enterprise canteens across the country are also running farms. These are all inspiring news and new signs brought about by the Great Leap Forward. Communes running industries, farmers participating in certain industrial labor; factories running farms, workers participating in certain agricultural labor - this not only plays a positive role in gradually eliminating the gap between urban and rural areas, but also, for the time being, will be a practical and self-reliant way to improve the supply of non-staple food in cities.

	The fact that the Dalian Limestone Mine was able to slaughter two pigs and five sheep during the celebration eloquently proves this point.

    磨刀霍霍向猪羊
    天津永利化工厂　林泽尘
    “磨刀霍霍向猪羊”一词出于有名的木兰词，是说花木兰的弟弟为了迎接姊姊的凯旋归家而盛情款待，杀猪宰羊。这是多么丰盛的筵席啊！不过这到底只是一家人之乐，我现在要述说的是一个企业庆功时为职工们杀猪宰羊的故事。
    因公出差的关系，我到大连石灰石矿去了一趟，在食堂用饭时见到了一张用红纸写出的布告，大意是：为了庆祝石矿被评为全国矿山红旗单位，党委会决定杀猪两头，宰羊五只，以示庆祝。全矿职工吃到了自己食堂饲养的猪羊真是皆大欢喜，表现在生产上是个个鼓足了更大干劲。
    大连石矿由于在继续大跃进的1959年作出优异的成绩，获得了全国红旗单位的光荣称号，这固然是件值得祝贺的大事，依我看来，连食堂能拿出自己饲养的猪羊来慰劳职工一事，也同样是值得祝贺的。
    过去，工厂企业是农业的当然消费者，而现在工厂里居然能吃到自己饲养的猪羊，这就不能不说是件新鲜而又可喜的事了。
    当然，我不是主张大吃大喝，而是主张应当更多生产，现在养得多，将来才能吃得多。养猪养羊，也可以人人动手。
    从报纸可以看到，全国许多城市的工矿企业的食堂也兼办农场。这些都是振奋人心的消息，也是大跃进带来的新气象。公社办工业，农民参加一定的工业劳动；工厂办农场，工人参加一定的农业劳动，这不单对逐步消除城乡差别起到积极的作用。就目前而论，这对改善城市副食品的供应，将是一个切实可行的自力更生的办法。
    大连石灰石矿之能够在庆功时杀猪两头，宰羊五只雄辩地证明了这一点。
