First Secretary of the CPC Licheng County Committee, Liu Yiwei

After communization, everyone in Licheng County plants walnuts, and every village plants walnuts. In one year, the county planted 25 million walnut trees, with an average of 1.7 *dou* of walnuts planted per household. Now the mountains and fields are covered with walnut saplings two to three feet high. The masses say: Communization has brought a great development of walnuts; planting walnuts is planting "seeds of happiness."

Last August, after the communization of Licheng County, the entire national economy has been comprehensively and continuously leaping forward. Among the thousands of miracles, one that is very encouraging is the afforestation movement. In just one year and three months, 240,000 *mu* of forest were created, and more than 150 million trees were planted. On average, each male and female laborer in the county afforested more than 4 *mu* and planted 2,500 trees. There is also a characteristic in afforestation: everyone plants walnuts, and every village plants walnuts. Last autumn and this spring, after two concentrated seedling cultivation and planting campaigns, the county planted a total of 25 million walnut trees, an average of 227 trees per person. Currently, there are three walnut mountains with an area of 5,000 *mu* that have been planted and are being transplanted, 187 double-thousand-*mu*, thousand-*mu*, and hundred-*mu* walnut mountains, 420 walnut ditches ranging from two to ten *li* in length, eight thousand-*mu* walnut orchards, and 158 hundred-*mu* walnut orchards and walnut slopes; more than 58,000 field ridges, bank roots, side embankments, and canal embankments have been greened with walnut trees, with a total length of approximately 4,000 kilometers. All seedling transfer and transplanting tasks will be completed by next spring. After the tasks are completed, among the eleven people's communes and 209 management areas in the county, there will be three communes with an average of more than 500 walnut trees per person, and seventeen management areas with an average of more than 1,000 trees per person. Now these saplings are growing two to three feet high, and each one is strong. People say, "Communization has brought a great development of walnuts."
Hands Skillfully Embroider a "Picture of Happiness"

Licheng County is a loess hilly and rocky mountainous area in the Taihang Mountains. The total area is 2.3 million *mu*, of which 330,000 *mu* are cultivated land. Excluding villages, rivers, grazing slopes, and rocky cliffs, there are 1.4 million *mu* of land suitable for afforestation, accounting for 56.5% of the total area. The forest area historically left behind is less than 100,000 *mu*, and it was also severely damaged by the Japanese devils and the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandits, resulting in almost total loss. Due to the scarcity of forests, the area of soil erosion in the county has reached 1.5 million *mu*, the climate is out of balance, and natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, hail, and floods have become a regular occurrence, seriously threatening agricultural production and affecting the lives of the people in the mountainous areas.

Afforestation and eliminating disasters are the most urgent requirements of the broad masses. This is a revolutionary base area. As early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the domestic Liberation War, the Party and the People's Government took advantage of the gaps in the war to lead the masses in afforestation. Since 1948, in ten years, 180,000 *mu* of new forests have been created and 60 million trees have been planted, including 7 million fruit trees, controlling an area of 900,000 *mu* for soil and water conservation.

After the people's communeization, the people have put forward higher aspirations for afforestation, namely: to further develop the production of economic forests, support socialist construction, and beautify the mountainous areas of the motherland. According to the climate, soil quality, topography, and labor distribution in the Licheng area, vigorously planting walnuts is an important measure to meet the needs of the masses. After the call to "plant one *sheng* of walnuts per household" was put forward in 1958, it quickly turned into practical action by 110,000 people in the county. An old man in the Thirty *mu* Management Area, named Wang Chunrong, who is already 67 years old, planted 5,000 walnut trees with all his might. The "Red Scarves" of the first team of the Taipei Management Area Elementary School planted 1,250 walnut trees per person. A "Long March Team" composed of 20 people from the Nanweiquan Commune braved the wind and rain, searched along the mountains, and fought hundreds of kilometers, sowing more than 315,000 walnut trees. The masses at Lingdi smashed the mountain rocks to plant walnuts. This management area, with only 34 households, sowed 350 *mu* of walnuts, with each laborer planting an average of more than 8,200 walnut trees. Members of the County Party Committee Secretariat planted more than 100 walnut trees per person. The results show that the county planted 25 million walnut trees, and each household planted not one *sheng* of walnuts, but 1.7 *dou*.

A year of hard work has sown the seeds of eternal happiness. Walnut trees will provide a large amount of walnut oil, walnut kernels, and walnut timber to support national construction and exports, while increasing the income of the people in the mountainous areas and improving their material living standards; it will play a role in conserving water sources, improving soil, controlling soil erosion, and changing the natural climate, promoting the development of agricultural production; more importantly, thousands of people have broadened their horizons, saw the bright prospects of socialist construction in the mountainous areas, and promoted the consolidation of the people's communes.

Commune Strength is Great

In one year, Licheng County planted walnuts all over the mountains and fields. This fact once again demonstrates the superiority of the people's communes.

After communization, the commune carried out economic zoning on a larger scale and allocated labor on a larger scale, unified planning for production, and quickly solved a series of problems that were difficult for advanced cooperatives to solve. This is the fundamental reason for the great development of walnuts. (1) Before afforestation, the county and commune absorbed some labor models, experienced veteran farmers, cattle and sheep workers, and representatives from afforestation, water conservancy, and animal husbandry to form a planning committee and a greening headquarters. Management areas and production teams (including mountain villages, small villages, and shelters) all established planning and greening guidance groups to launch a mass large-scale afforestation movement on one mountain and one ridge with planning and leadership. Because the walnut is a fruit tree that likes warmth, and its root system is widely and deeply distributed, it is generally planned to be planted on the sunny slopes of mountain gullies and valleys with deep, fertile, and moist sandy loam, or on field ridges and embankments; walnut orchards planned on cultivated land implement intercropping of forests and grains within three years, so as not to affect agricultural output due to planting walnuts. (2) According to the principle of "voluntary equivalence," the commune uniformly allocated labor and widely organized a large-scale collaborative campaign to plant walnuts, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient labor. (3) The people's commune uniformly planned production and timely solved the seed problem in the large-scale walnut planting movement. The solution: one is unified allocation and transfer by the county and the people's commune; the other is relying on the masses to contribute seeds. A total of more than 520,000 *jin* of walnut seeds were allocated. (4) During the large-scale walnut planting, more than 70 poor management areas lacked funds and tools, and were once behind the advanced management areas. The people's commune used the strength of the public collective economy to help them solve the funding problem, so that these management areas quickly caught up with the advanced management areas. (5) The people's commune also timely solved the technical problems of planting walnuts. In the past, some people regarded planting walnuts as extremely mysterious, saying that only "experts" could plant them and make them survive; in places where walnut trees had not been planted before, some people believed that to plant walnut trees, they must go to Shexian County, Hebei Province, to invite "craftsmen." However, the Party organization resolutely relied on the masses, summarized experience locally, printed and distributed technical manuals, trained technical experts, and widely organized the masses to visit and practice, so that tens of thousands of people mastered the technology of walnut cultivation.

The masses compare walnuts to "seeds of happiness," and I don't think it's an exaggeration at all. Walnut buds will surely grow and become strong, evergreen, and forever create happiness for people. In the future, our task is to carefully cultivate and protect these buds, so that they can quickly blossom and bear fruit. (Attached picture)

    公社化带来核桃满山
    中共黎城县委第一书记　刘已未
    公社化以后，黎城县人人种核桃，村村种核桃，一年之间，全县种核桃二千五百万株，每户平均种核桃一斗七升。现在漫山遍野都是二、三尺高的核桃树苗。群众说：公社带来了核桃大发展，种下核桃就是种下“幸福种子”。
    去年8月黎城县公社化后，整个国民经济一直是全面地、持续地向前跃进。在千百项奇迹中，一项非常鼓舞人的，是植树造林运动。仅仅一年零三个月，即造林二十四万亩，植树一亿五千多万株，全县每个男女劳力平均造林四亩多，植树二千五百株。造林中还有一个特色：人人种核桃，村村种核桃。去年秋季和今年春季，经过两个突击育苗和栽种运动，全县共种核桃树二千五百万株，每人平均二百二十七株。目前已经栽种和正在移植的有五千亩面积的核桃山三个，双千亩、千亩和百亩核桃山一百八十七个，二里至十里长的核桃沟四百二十个，千亩核桃园八个，百亩核桃园和核桃垙一百五十八个；以核桃树绿化田埂、岸根、边堰、渠埝五万八千多道，总长度约四千公里。全部移苗和移栽任务将在明年春季完成。任务完成后，全县十一个人民公社，二百零九个管理区，每人平均五百株核桃树以上的有三个公社，每人平均一千株以上的管理区有十七个。现在这些树苗均长起二、三尺高，棵棵茁壮。人们说是“公社化带来了核桃大发展”。双手巧绣“幸福图”
    黎城县是太行山上一个黄土丘陵和石山地区。总面积为二百三十万亩，其中耕地三十三万亩，除去村庄、河流、牧坡和石山悬崖，宜林地一百四十万亩，占总面积56.5％。历史上遗留下来的林木面积不足十万亩，还惨遭日本鬼子和蒋阎匪帮的破坏，损失殆尽。由于林木稀少，全县水土流失面积达一百五十万亩，气候失调，旱、涝、风、雹、洪等自然灾害的袭击已成定律，严重威胁着农业生产，影响着山区人民的生活。
    植树造林，排除灾害，是广大群众最迫切的要求。这里是革命根据地，早在抗日战争和国内解放战争时期，党和人民政府就曾乘战争空隙，领导群众进行植树造林。从1948年以来，十年中新造林十八万亩，植树六千万株，其中水果树七百万株，控制水土保持面积达九十万亩。
    人民公社化以后，人民群众在植树造林事业上提出了更高的愿望，这就是：进一步发展经济林木生产，支援社会主义建设，美化祖国山区。根据黎城地区的气候、土质、地形地势以及劳动力分布状况，大力种植核桃，正是体现群众要求的一项重要措施。1958年提出“每户栽种一升核桃”的号召后，很快变成了全县十一万群众的实际行动。三十亩管理区一位老大爷，名叫王春荣，已经六十七岁了，他一股劲栽下五千棵核桃树。台北管理区小学一队“红领巾”，每人栽核桃树一千二百五十株。南委泉公社一支由二十人组成的“远征队”，顶风冒雨，沿山摸岭，转战数百公里，播下核桃三十一万五千多株。岭底群众砸碎岭石插核桃，这个仅有三十四户的管理区，播种核桃三百五十亩，每个劳力平均栽核桃八千二百多株。县委书记处成员每人栽核桃在百株以上。结果统计，全县种核桃二千五百万株，每户栽下的核桃不是一升，而是一斗七升。
    一年辛苦，播下了万年幸福的种子。核桃树将提供大量的核桃油、核桃仁及核桃木材，支援国家建设和出口，同时增加山区群众的收入，提高物质生活水平；它将起到涵养水源、改良土壤、控制水土流失和改变自然气候的作用，促进农业生产的发展；更重要的是，成千上万的群众开拓了眼界，看到了山区社会主义建设的灿烂前景，促进了人民公社的巩固。
      公社力量大
    一年之间，黎城县满山遍野地种上了核桃，这个事实又一次说明了人民公社的优越性。
    公社化以后，公社在更大范围内进行经济区化和在更大范围内调配劳动力，统一计划生产，迅速解决了高级社难以解决的一系列问题，这是实现核桃大发展的根本原因。（1）在造林之前，县和公社吸收一部分劳动模范、技术老农、牛羊工及造林、水利、畜牧方面的代表，组成规划委员会和绿化指挥部，管理区及生产队（包括山庄、小村、窝铺）都成立规划和绿化指导小组，有计划有领导的展开一片山、一个岭的群众性大面积的造林运动。因为核桃是一种喜爱温暖的果树，它的根系分布广而深，一般都规划在土层深厚、肥沃潮润、沙质壤土的山沟与山谷的阳坡上，或者田埂堤岸上；规划在耕地上的核桃园，三年之内实行林、粮间作，不致因种核桃而影响到农业产量。（2）根据“自愿等价”原则，公社统一调配劳动力，广泛组织突击栽种核桃大协作，克服了劳动力不足的困难。（3）人民公社统一筹划生产，及时解决了大种核桃运动中的种子问题。解决的办法：一是由县和人民公社统一调剂和调运；二是依靠群众献种。前后共调剂核桃种五十二万余斤。（4）在大种核桃当中有七十多个贫困管理区缺乏资金及工具，曾一度落在先进管理区的后面，人民公社以公有集体经济力量，帮助他们解决了资金问题，使这些管理区很快赶上了先进管理区。（5）人民公社还及时解决了栽核桃的技术问题。过去有些群众把栽核桃看得异常神秘，说不是“内行”栽不活；没栽过核桃树的地方，有人认为要栽核桃树一定得到河北涉县请“把式”。但是，党组织坚决依靠群众，就地总结经验，印发技术手册，训练技术能手，广泛组织群众参观和实习，使数万群众掌握了栽培核桃的技术。
    群众把核桃比作“幸福种”子，我看一点也不过分。核桃的幼芽必将生长壮大起来，万古长青，永远为人们造幸福。今后我们的任务是要精心培育和保护这批幼芽，让它迅速开花结果。（附图片）
