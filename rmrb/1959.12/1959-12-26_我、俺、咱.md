　　I, An, Zan
　　Ding Shan'ao
    We often see in published works that the character "I" (我) is written as "Zan" (咱) or "An" (俺), which makes people feel more intimately that the characters portrayed by the author are working people who often live in the north. However, what is strange is that in some works, even when it is the same character, once "Zan" or "An" is used instead of "I," the character "I" still keeps coming out of the same character's mouth, resulting in a situation where "Zan" or "An" is mixed with "I," and sometimes "I" is mixed with "Zan" or "An," making it difficult for the reader to clearly determine whether the character in the work is from the south or the north. Although the problem lies only in randomly misusing a word, it creates a sense of confusion and impracticality in the reader's mind. Because readers would say: In life, we rarely encounter people who mix "I, An, Zan" when speaking.

    我们常从报刊发表的作品里，看到有把“我”字写成“咱”或“俺”字的，这更使人亲切地感到作者刻划的人物，是常居北地的劳动人民。然而，令人奇怪的是，有些作品里同是一个人物，一经以“咱”或“俺”来代“我”，可这“我”字却仍然不断从同一个人物嘴里说出，弄成一会“咱”或“俺”夹杂着“我”，一会“我”又夹杂着“咱”或“俺”，使读者难于明确作品里的人物究竟是南方人或北方人。虽然问题只在于随意搬乱一个字，但在读者印象里却造成糊涂和不实际的感觉。因为读者会说：生活中很少遇到把“我、俺、咱”混合说着的人呵。
