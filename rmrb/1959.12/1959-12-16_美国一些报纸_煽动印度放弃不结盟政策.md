Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th - Around the time of U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to India, some major American newspapers have been vigorously inciting India to abandon its non-aligned policy and form a military alliance with Pakistan. The "New York Herald Tribune," in an editorial on the 8th, called India and Pakistan "the decisive battleground of the Cold War." The newspaper stated that India must "recognize that it shares a common destiny and tribulations with Pakistan." The editorial bluntly stated that Pakistan has joined the Western military bloc, and it would be "wrong if Indian Prime Minister Nehru, because of this or any other difference, fails to see the urgent need to strengthen ties with India's closest neighbor."

The "New York Herald Tribune" also published an editorial on the 11th, stating that Eisenhower's speech in the Indian Parliament showed that "the basic philosophy determining the policies of India and the United States has never been so close." The editorial also said that "India will no longer deny that goodwill alone is not enough to defend its borders from" so-called "communist aggression." The United States and India "can emphasize their common goals and ideals, rather than their differences."

The "New York Times" also incited India to abandon its non-aligned policy in an editorial on the 10th. The editorial falsely accused China of "invading India" and claimed that India's "years of non-alignment" have been "badly rewarded." The editorial stated that the United States "has no designs on India" and hopes to provide economic "assistance" to India.

Some editorials in the "New York Daily News" falsely accused China of "invading India's northern border" and, under this pretext, advocated for a military alliance between India and Pakistan. The editorial clamored that "Pakistan's rulers have a strong army and are fiercely anti-communist, so the next chapter of Pakistan's history may be an alliance with India," saying that Pakistan could become "a strong and brave ally" for India.

    美国一些报纸
    煽动印度放弃不结盟政策
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国总统艾森豪威尔访问印度前后，美国一些大报竭力煽动印度放弃不结盟政策，同巴基斯坦结成军事联盟。“纽约先驱论坛报”在8日的评论中把印度和巴基斯坦称为“冷战的决定性的战场。”这家报纸说印度要“认识到它跟巴基斯坦是共命运，同患难的”。评论露骨地说，巴基斯坦参加了西方的军事集团，如果印度总理尼赫鲁由于这一点或任何其他分歧的原因“就看不到加强同印度的最紧密的邻国的联系这种迫切需要，那将是错误的”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”11日还发表社论说，艾森豪威尔在印度议会的演说表明，“决定印度和美国的政策的基本哲学从未这样接近过”。社论同时还说“印度现在不会再否认，仅仅是善意是不足以保卫边境不受”所谓“共产主义侵犯的”。美国和印度“可以强调它们的共同目标和理想，而不强调它们的分歧”。
    “纽约时报”10日在一篇社论中也煽动印度放弃不结盟政策。社论诬蔑中国“侵入了印度”，并且说什么印度“多年的不结盟”“得到了恶报”。社论说什么美国“对印度没有图谋”，美国希望在经济上对印度进行“帮助”。
      “纽约每日新闻”的一些社论诬蔑中国“侵入了印度的北部边境”，并且在这个借口下鼓吹印度和巴基斯坦缔结军事同盟。社论叫嚷说，“巴基斯坦的统治者有着强大的武装，而且是激烈反共的，所以巴基斯坦历史的下一章可能是同印度组成一个联盟”，说巴基斯坦可以成为印度的“一个强大而又勇敢的盟国”。
