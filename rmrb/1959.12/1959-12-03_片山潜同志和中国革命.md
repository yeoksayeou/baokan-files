    Comrade Katayama Sen and the Chinese Revolution
    Kang Sheng
    December 3rd this year marks the centenary of Comrade Katayama Sen's birth. The Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese working people, and progressive individuals will commemorate this outstanding Japanese Marxist and remarkable leader of the proletarian revolutionary movement on this day. As a comrade and friend of Comrade Katayama Sen in the international communist movement, I am filled with boundless admiration and wish to join the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people in commemorating this best friend of our Chinese revolution.
    Comrade Katayama Sen was a pioneer of the Japanese proletarian revolutionary movement, a founder of the Japanese Communist Party, and one of the earliest enlighteners of the Eastern communist movement. As early as the late 19th century, he began to spread Marxism in the East. He dedicated his precious life entirely to the liberation movement of the Japanese working people, while also tirelessly engaging in supporting the Eastern revolution and the Chinese revolution. Consequently, his name and his activities are not only warmly admired by the Japanese people but also sincerely loved by Marxists in various Eastern countries.
    In 1933, I had the opportunity to meet and live with Comrade Katayama Sen, whom I had long respected, in the Comintern, which was an extremely happy occasion for me. Unfortunately, he passed away in November of the same year. I attended Comrade Katayama Sen's funeral with infinite sorrow. Although our time together was so short, my understanding of Comrade Katayama Sen's revolutionary activities, especially his enthusiastic concern for and active support of our Chinese revolution, will forever live in my heart. And I am also deeply convinced that it will forever live in the hearts of our Chinese people.
    Comrade Katayama Sen had a profound scientific foresight and extraordinary enthusiasm for the Chinese revolution. As early as March 1919, on the eve of the Chinese "May Fourth Movement," he made a correct Marxist-Leninist assessment of the future prospects of the Chinese revolution in an article titled "Japan and China" published in the American left-wing magazine "Class Struggle." He said: "Judging from recent developments, I think China will probably not develop into a mature capitalist country. The upcoming revolution in China, like its neighbor Russia, will develop towards the establishment of a socialist-communist republic. The Chinese revolution will succeed earlier than Japan, which is more developed in capitalism." The historical practice of the Chinese revolutionary movement over the past forty years has fully proven Comrade Katayama Sen's prediction of the future of the Chinese revolution. This also demonstrates Comrade Katayama Sen's high level of Marxist-Leninist cultivation and outstanding insights.
    From December 1921 onwards, Comrade Katayama Sen resided in Moscow and participated in the work of the Comintern. From then until his death, he was engaged in supporting the Eastern revolutionary movement within the Comintern. Among these, supporting our country's revolution was one of his important tasks. In 1924, he visited China, which was precisely when the great revolutionary storm of 1924-1927 in our country was beginning. He investigated the Chinese revolution at that time and, in his "Impressions of a Trip to China," gave warm praise and high evaluation to our country's revolutionary movement and the working class and revolutionary intellectuals. He wrote: "Although the Chinese workers' movement started late, its leaders, who are intellectuals, are thoroughly revolutionary people armed with Marxism-Leninism. … Compared to Japan, the Chinese workers' movement has its advantages, that is, the Chinese workers are stronger than the Japanese workers in terms of unity. … Chinese workers, especially the general people, have no sense of official superiority over civilians, and they are not afraid of official suppression. It is not uncommon to resist official suppression. Therefore, workers are not afraid of the police's suppression of the workers' movement, especially the suppression of strikes. This is a very good characteristic of the workers' movement. … If the imperialist powers are stubborn and must violate the will of the 400 million Chinese people and continue to exploit them, then the Chinese outcome will imitate worker-peasant Russia. … The Chinese revolution is advancing with irresistible force, just like the Yangtze River's torrent. This is my impression after coming to China." After I met Comrade Katayama Sen, he enthusiastically told me about his visit to China at that time.
    Comrade Katayama Sen's fervent praise for the Chinese revolution, and his strong hatred and uncompromising spirit towards the Japanese imperialist elements, the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people at that time, fully demonstrated his noble communist style. When he fled abroad, he bravely declared that he would never compromise with the Japanese reactionary ruling class, the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, and was determined to dedicate his life to communism. He said: "I have told my friends that I want to return to Japan. But this does not mean stopping the socialist movement. If I am asked to stop communist activities, I would rather die. … I repeat, I will never yield to the Tanaka cabinet, which is trying to strangle the Chinese revolution." (See the Japanese "Industry World" magazine, December 1927)
    When the Chinese revolution was devastated in 1927 and Japanese imperialism massively invaded China, Comrade Katayama Sen enthusiastically encouraged our people to support our country's revolution, while also loudly appealing to the people of the world, demanding that they launch a movement against Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. In July 1928, the Comintern held its Sixth Congress, and Comrade Katayama Sen, on behalf of the Japanese, British, American, and other branches of the Comintern, presented a declaration on the Chinese revolution at the congress. This declaration added enormous strength to our people who were in difficulty. The declaration enthusiastically wrote: "Chinese workers and peasants! The world proletariat is sharing weal and woe with you. To overthrow imperialism in China and break through the imperialist front in the most important place requires sacrifice and courage. However, the Chinese workers have shocked the world with their boldness, their loyalty to the revolution, and their heroic death-defying actions. Tens of thousands of workers and peasants have died under the knives of imperialism and the Kuomintang. But the revolution is still developing, and the revolutionary ranks are growing stronger. The comrades who died in the struggle will be immortal! … Dear comrades! The international proletariat clearly knows that you are the shock troops of the proletarian revolution… In order to support the national revolutionary struggle, the Sixth Congress regards organizing the forces of the international proletariat and promoting the victory of the Chinese revolution as one of its main tasks." Comrade Katayama Sen finally shouted: "Long live the independent and united Chinese Soviet Republic!"
    After Japanese imperialism massively invaded our country in 1931, Comrade Katayama Sen gave a speech at the World Anti-War Congress held in Amsterdam in 1932, saying: "Japanese imperialists are not only the enemies of the Chinese and Korean people but also the enemies of Japanese workers and peasants." "Now Japanese imperialists are plundering Northeast China, attacking Jehol and Shanghai, killing and arson." He particularly pointed out that the Japanese communists and the Japanese revolutionary workers and peasants were carrying out a heroic anti-war struggle together with the Chinese people against this cruel war of aggression by Japanese imperialism. Japanese imperialists had already started the flames of imperialist war of aggression in China, and the people of the world were facing the danger of a world war. Therefore, he loudly called on the working people of the world at the congress: "We must oppose imperialist war with revolutionary war, and we must transform imperialist war into domestic war." In September 1933, Comrade Katayama Sen wrote a letter to Romain Rolland and others, requesting the International Anti-War and Anti-Fascist Struggle Committee to organize a worldwide movement against Chiang Kai-shek. In the letter, he wrote: "Please pay attention to another counter-revolutionary action. We must launch an international-scale anti-movement to oppose this counter-revolutionary action. This is Chiang Kai-shek's fifth 'encirclement and suppression' campaign against the Chinese Soviets and the Red Army with the active assistance of American and British imperialism. The counter-revolutionary executioner has obtained the full support of imperialism and is more prepared than in the past. Now the Chinese revolution is facing a greater threat. I believe that the International Anti-War and Anti-Fascist Committee must organize a world-scale movement against Chiang Kai-shek. This struggle will simultaneously be an anti-war and anti-fascist movement."
    The above-listed partial facts are enough to tell us what precious friendship and sincere assistance Comrade Katayama Sen gave to the Chinese revolution in the years when the Chinese people were facing heavy disasters. This is something that the Chinese people can never forget. Now the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, have achieved liberation, won the victory of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and are making doubled efforts to build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and technology. This great fact can completely comfort Comrade Katayama Sen's earnest expectations for the Chinese revolution during his lifetime. At the same time, I also firmly believe that the Japanese revolution, which Comrade Katayama Sen hoped for and struggled for throughout his life, will surely be victorious after the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people follow the direction pointed out by Comrade Katayama Sen and make arduous efforts.

    片山潜同志和中国革命
    康生
    今年12月3日，是片山潜同志诞生一百周年。日本共产党、日本劳动人民和进步人士，都将在这个日子里，来纪念这位日本杰出的马克思主义者和无产阶级革命运动的卓越领袖。作为片山潜同志的国际共产主义运动的同志和朋友，我油然地涌溢出无限的追慕心情，愿同日本共产党和日本人民一道，来纪念这位我们中国革命的最好的朋友。
    片山潜同志是日本无产阶级革命运动的先驱，日本共产党的创始人，又是东方共产主义运动最早的启蒙者之一。早在十九世纪末叶，他就开始在东方传播马克思主义。他把自己宝贵的一生完全贡献给日本劳动人民的解放运动，同时又孜孜不倦地从事于支援东方革命和中国革命的工作，因而他的名字和他的活动，不仅受到了日本人民的热烈景仰，而且也受到了东方各国马克思主义者的衷心爱戴。
    1933年，我在共产国际有机会同素所敬爱的片山潜同志相识而且同住在一起，朝夕过从，这对我是一件极其高兴的事情。但不幸的是，同年11月，他就与世长辞了。我当时怀着无限悲痛的心情，参加了片山潜同志的丧礼。虽然我们相处在一起的时间是那样短促，但是我所了解的片山潜同志的革命活动，特别是他对于我们中国革命的热情关怀和积极的支援活动，却永远地活在我的心中。而且我也深信，它也将永远地活在我们中国人民的心中。
    片山潜同志对于中国的革命，是具有深刻的科学预见和非凡的热情的。早在1919年3月，即中国“五四运动”的前夕，他就在美国左翼刊物“阶级斗争”杂志上所撰的“日本和中国”一文中，对中国革命的未来前途，作出了马克思列宁主义的正确论断。他说：“从最近发展的情况来看，我认为中国大概不会发展成为一个成熟的资本主义国家，中国即将到来的革命，将和邻邦的俄国一样，向着建立社会主义——共产主义的共和国发展。中国革命将比资本主义发达的日本，更早地取得成功。”四十年来，中国革命运动的历史实践，完全证明了片山潜同志对于中国革命前途的预言。这也表明了片山潜同志所具有的马克思列宁主义的高度修养和卓越的见解。
    从1921年12月以后，片山潜同志就居留于莫斯科参加共产国际的工作。从这时起，直到逝世为止，他一直在共产国际内部从事支援东方革命运动的工作。其中对于我国革命的支援，是他的重要工作之一。1924年，他曾来中国访问，当时正是我国1924—1927年巨大革命风暴开始的时候。他考察了当时的中国革命，并且在他所写的“中国旅行杂感”一文中，对于我国当时的革命运动和工人阶级、革命知识分子，给予了热烈的赞扬和很高的评价。他写道：“中国的工人运动虽然兴起较晚，但是它的知识分子出身的领袖，却是用马列主义武装的、彻底革命的人。……中国的工人运动和日本比起来有它的优点，这就是在团结这点上，中国工人要比日本工人强。……中国工人，特别是一般人民，毫无官尊民卑的感觉，他们更不害怕官方的镇压。对官方的镇压实行抵制是决不稀奇的事。因此工人对于警察对工人运动的镇压，特别是对罢工的镇压毫不畏惧。这是工人运动很好的特点。……如果帝国主义列强冥顽不化，一定要违背中国四亿人民的意志，继续进行剥削，那么中国结局就将仿效工农俄国。……中国的革命正以不可阻挡之势向前进展着，正如扬子江的巨流一样。这就是我来中国后的感想。”当我和片山潜同志相识后，他又热情洋溢地把他那次访问中国的情况告诉给我。
    片山潜同志对于中国的革命是这样的热烈讴歌，而对于当时中国人民和日本人民的共同敌人日本帝国主义分子又是怀抱着强烈的憎恨和决不妥协的精神，这充分表现了他的崇高的共产主义风格。在他亡命国外的时候，他曾勇敢地宣布决不对中日人民共同的敌人日本反动的统治阶级作丝毫妥协，而决心为共产主义献出自己的生命。他说：“我曾经告诉过我的朋友，我想回日本。但是这决不是意味着停止社会主义运动，如果要我停止共产主义的活动，我是毋宁死的。……我再重复说一遍，我决不向企图扼杀中国革命的田中内阁作任何屈服。”（见1927年12月日本“实业之世界”杂志）
    当1927年中国革命遭受到摧残，日本帝国主义大肆侵略中国的时候，片山潜同志为支援我国革命，对我国人民进行了热情的鼓舞，同时又向世界人民大声疾呼，要求展开反对日本帝国主义和蒋介石的运动。1928年7月，共产国际召开第六次大会，片山潜同志在会上代表共产国际的日本、英国、美国等支部，提出了对中国革命的宣言。这一宣言给正处在困难中的我国人民增加了莫大的力量。宣言热情地写道：“中国的工人、农民们！全世界无产阶级正和你们一起同甘共苦。要推翻在中国的帝国主义和在最重要的地点突破帝国主义的战线，是需要牺牲和勇气的。然而中国的工人，已经以他们的大胆、他们对革命的忠诚和他们英雄的决死行动，使全世界为之震惊。几万工人、农民死在帝国主义和国民党的屠刀下。但是革命依旧在发展着，革命的队伍更加壮大。在斗争中死去的同志们将永垂不朽！……亲爱的同志们！国际无产阶级清楚地知道，你们是无产阶级革命的突击队……为了支持民族革命斗争，第六次大会把组织国际无产阶级的力量和促进中国革命的胜利，看作是自己的主要任务之一。”片山潜同志最后高呼：“独立的团结的中华苏维埃共和国万岁！”
    1931年，日本帝国主义大举进犯我国以后，片山潜同志又在1932年于阿姆斯特丹召开的世界反战大会上发表演讲说：“日本帝国主义者不仅是中国人、朝鲜人的敌人，也是日本工人和农民的敌人。”“现在日本帝国主义者又在掠夺中国的东北，进攻热河和上海，杀人放火。”他特别指出，对于日本帝国主义的这种残酷的侵略战争，日本共产党人和日本革命的工农群众正在同中国人民一道进行着英勇的反战斗争。日本帝国主义者已在中国开始点起了帝国主义侵略战争的火焰，世界人民已面临着世界大战的危险，因此，他在大会上向全世界劳动人民大声疾呼地号召：“我们必须以革命战争来反对帝国主义战争，必须变帝国主义战争为国内战争。”1933年9月，片山潜同志又写信给罗曼·罗兰等，要求国际反战反法西斯斗争委员会，组织全世界规模的反对蒋介石的运动。他在信中写道：“请各位注意另一个反革命行动，我们必须展开国际规模的反对运动来反对这个反革命行动，这就是蒋介石在美、英帝国主义的积极协助下，对中国苏维埃和红军发动的第五次‘围剿’。反革命刽子手已经取得帝国主义的全力支持，比过去有更多的准备。现在中国革命正受到更大的威胁，我认为国际反战反法西斯委员会必须组织世界规模的反对蒋介石的运动。这个斗争将同时是反战、反法西斯的运动。”
    上述列举的部分事实已足以告诉我们，在中国人民灾难重重的年月里，片山潜同志给了中国革命以多么宝贵的友情和真诚的援助，这是中国人民永远不能忘记的。现在中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下已经获得了解放，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，并正在为把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家而进行加倍的努力，这个伟大的事实是完全可以告慰于片山潜同志生前对于中国革命的殷殷热望的。同时，我也坚决相信，片山潜同志所瞩望的、并为其奋斗一生的日本革命，在日本共产党和日本人民沿着片山潜同志所指出的方向，经过艰巨的努力之后，也是一定能够胜利的。
