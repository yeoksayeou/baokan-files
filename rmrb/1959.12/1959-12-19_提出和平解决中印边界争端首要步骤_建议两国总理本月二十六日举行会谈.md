Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: Premier Zhou Enlai replied to Indian Prime Minister Nehru's letter of November 16th regarding the Sino-Indian border issue on December 17th. The full text of Premier Zhou's letter is as follows:
To His Excellency Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of the Republic of India, New Delhi, Dear Prime Minister,

Thank you for your letter of November 16, 1959. Although the Indian government's views on preventing border conflicts are somewhat different from the Chinese government's suggestions of November 7th, and some of these views are obviously unfair, it is gratifying that you expressed your willingness in your letter to find ways to avoid all border conflicts and resolve the border dispute between the two countries through peaceful means.

The Chinese government's suggestion on November 7th that the armed forces of the two countries each withdraw twenty kilometers from the entire border is intended to completely eliminate the difficult-to-predict dangers of border conflicts, fundamentally change the current tense situation of armed confrontation between the two countries on the border, and create a good atmosphere of mutual trust between the two countries. These objectives cannot be achieved by other temporary measures. Taking this measure before the border is demarcated will not in any way restrict either party from making its own claims when negotiating a resolution to the border issue. Therefore, the Chinese government still sincerely hopes that, for the sake of the friendship between our two countries for the past and future millennia, we can reach an agreement on such measures. As for how far the armed forces of the two countries should withdraw, the Chinese government is fully willing to consult with the Indian government to determine a distance that both parties deem appropriate.

Pending agreement on the above, the Chinese government, in the spirit of reconciliation and with the desire to move towards a full-scale withdrawal, is prepared to agree first to a partial solution, that is, to apply the suggestion you made in your letter that neither side station troops in Longju to other disputed border locations. In the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border, Indian armed personnel once occupied Longju and still occupy Khenzemane. In the western section of the Sino-Indian border, Indian armed personnel still occupy Shipki Pass, Pariqas, Sang, Tsungsha, Poling, Dza, Chujer, Kharnak Fort, and Lapthal. Most of these locations, which definitely belong to China, were gradually occupied by Indian armed personnel after the signing of the 1954 agreement between China and India on trade and communication between the Tibet region of China and India, which first proposed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Poling, in particular, is one of the ten trading markets in the Ali region of Tibet, China, which the Chinese government agreed to open, as specified in Article 2, Section 2 of the 1954 agreement. Now that the Indian government has different opinions on the ownership of these locations, the Chinese government suggests that neither side station armed personnel at any of the above-mentioned locations.

Pending further agreement between the two sides, the Chinese government also welcomes the Indian government's suggestion that border outposts of both sides cease sending out patrols. In fact, after the Kongka Pass incident, the Chinese government had already instructed the Chinese border troops to cease sending out patrols from all outposts on the entire Sino-Indian border. Since the Indian side has also taken the same steps, this is certainly a welcome step forward in protecting the tranquility of the border between the two countries. However, the Chinese government would like to clarify that the suggestion to cease patrols should apply to the entire Sino-Indian border, and not to adopt different measures in the section of the border bordering Ladakh, India.

The Chinese government is greatly puzzled by Your Excellency's separate suggestion on preventing conflicts in the section of the border between China and Ladakh, India. The Chinese government deems it necessary to point out that: (1) There is no reason to single out this section of the border. The actual line of control on both sides of this section of the border, like the actual line of control on both sides of other sections of the Sino-Indian border, is very clear. In fact, the 1956 Chinese map you mentioned correctly marked the traditional boundary between the two countries in this section. Apart from the Pariqas area on the Sangzangbu River, India has not occupied any Chinese territory east of this traditional boundary line. (2) Your Excellency's suggestion is a major step backward from the principle that the two countries have long agreed to temporarily maintain the existing state of the border. To demand a substantial change in this situation as a prerequisite for eliminating border conflicts is not to narrow the dispute but to widen it. (3) Your Excellency's suggestion is unfair. Your Excellency suggests that, in this section, Chinese personnel withdraw east of the boundary line marked on Indian maps, and Indian personnel withdraw west of the boundary line marked on Chinese maps. To those who are unaware of the truth, this suggestion may seem "equal." However, even the most anti-China newspapers in India immediately pointed out that, according to this suggestion, India's "concession" is only theoretical. Because the area involved does not belong to India in the first place, and India has no personnel to withdraw from there, while China needs to withdraw border guards and civil administration personnel belonging to Hotan County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Rutog County in the Ali region of the Tibet Autonomous Region from more than 33,000 square kilometers of territory that has long belonged to it. (4) This area has long been under Chinese jurisdiction and is of great significance to China. Since the Qing Dynasty, this area has been the lifeline connecting Xinjiang and the vast western regions of Tibet. As early as the second half of 1950, troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army passed through the traditional transportation line in this area from Xinjiang to the Ali region of Tibet to guard the border. For nine years, they have been using this transportation line normally and frequently to obtain supplies. From March 1956 to October 1957, Chinese border troops, together with more than 3,000 laborers, based on this transportation line, built a 1,200-kilometer-long highway from Yecheng in southwestern Xinjiang to Gartok in southwestern Tibet, winding around high mountains, building bridges, and constructing culverts under extremely difficult natural conditions. From the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang and Tibet, the stationing and patrolling of troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in this area, until the incident in September 1958 when Indian armed personnel invaded the area, the Chinese side carried out such a large number of activities in this area under its jurisdiction for a total of eight or nine years; while the Indian side knew nothing about it. This powerfully proves that this area has indeed consistently belonged to China's jurisdiction and not to India's. Now the Indian government insists that this area has always belonged to India's jurisdiction, which is absolutely unconvincing.

If, after understanding the above views of the Chinese government, the Indian government still insists that its claims regarding this area are appropriate, then the Chinese government is willing to know whether the Indian government is prepared to apply the same principle equally to the eastern section of the border, that is, to stipulate that both China and India withdraw all personnel from the area between the so-called McMahon Line and the Sino-Indian border line in the eastern section marked on Chinese maps (which has also been marked on Indian maps for a long time). The Chinese government has so far not made any claims to the area south of the so-called McMahon Line as a precondition or transitional measure. What I find difficult to understand is why the Indian government insists on making demands regarding China's unilateral withdrawal from its western border area.

Your Excellency and the Indian government have repeatedly mentioned the historical data on the Sino-Indian border presented by the Indian side. The Chinese side originally expected to present its detailed responses to Your Excellency's letter of September 26 and the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note of November 4 during the upcoming talks between the Prime Ministers of the two countries, and believed that it would be more appropriate to do so. Since the talks between the Prime Ministers of the two countries have not yet taken place, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared to issue a response soon. I do not want to go into the details of the issue here. I would just like to point out once again the simple fact that, according to objective history, the entire border between our two countries has indeed not been demarcated, and it is impossible to deny this. I have noted that the Indian side's account of the border between the two countries deliberately ignores many obvious basic facts. For example, they do not mention that the official maps drawn by the Survey of India, even in the 1938 edition, still depict the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border in accordance with Chinese maps, while no boundary line is drawn for the western section of the Sino-Indian border; even the 1950, 1951, and 1952 editions published after the founding of the People's Republic of China, although the eastern and western sections of the Sino-Indian border were drawn incorrectly, clearly indicated that they were undetermined boundaries. The Chinese government does not understand on what grounds the Indian government suddenly changed the undetermined boundaries in the eastern and western sections to determined boundaries on its maps in recent years. I have studied in detail the large amount of data cited in Your Excellency's letter of September 26, but I still cannot find any satisfactory answers.

The Chinese government has pointed out many times that the Sino-Indian border is long and has not been demarcated by the governments of the two countries, and the maps of the two countries differ, so it is natural for the two countries to hold different opinions on the border. As long as friendly consultations are conducted, this historical issue is not difficult to resolve reasonably. The People's Republic of China is a socialist country belonging to the working people. Here, those exploiting classes and pro-imperialist forces who attempt to profit from foreign expansion and foreign provocations have long lost their ground forever. The People's Republic of China has always been loyal to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and will never allow treating other countries with great-power chauvinism, let alone encroaching on an inch of another country's land. Moreover, China has such a vast territory, and more than half of the regions are sparsely populated and in need of vigorous development. It would be absurd and ridiculous to imagine that such a country would still go to some remote areas of its neighbors to find trouble. Therefore, although China has some undetermined borders with some neighboring countries in South Asia (whether these countries are large or small, friendly or unfriendly to China), China has never and will never use this situation to take unilateral actions to make any changes to the existing state of the border. Moreover, even after the border issue is resolved, China is prepared to work with all its neighbors to create the most peaceful, safe, and friendly border. Your Excellency knows that the past governments of China have never recognized the so-called McMahon Line in the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border, and the government of the People's Republic of China has also not recognized it, but the government of the People's Republic of China strictly abides by its statement and will never allow its armed personnel to cross this line, pending a friendly resolution of the border issue. It is obvious that since China has not even set foot on the large tracts of land south of the so-called McMahon Line, which not long ago (some of which belonged to the government of Tibet, China, as late as 1951) were under the jurisdiction of the local government of Tibet, China, it certainly would not have thought of setting foot on Indian territory at any location in the western section of the Sino-Indian border. There, the Chinese military and civil administration personnel, like those in other border areas, are only stationed on their own land. However, the fact that the Indian government not only adopts an unreasonable attitude of refusing to discuss the eastern section of the border, but also makes territorial claims to a piece of land in the western section of the border that India has never ruled, has indeed caused extraordinary surprise to the Chinese government and the Chinese people. In order to safeguard the friendship between China and India, the Chinese government has always tried its best to exercise restraint, hoping to resolve these disputes through friendly negotiations. Even after Indian armed personnel crossed into Chinese territory and provoked unfortunate incidents south of Maja and south of Kongka Pass one after another, the Chinese government still maintained the spirit of reconciliation, prevented the situation from expanding, and treated the captured Indian armed personnel in the Kongka Pass incident in a friendly manner. However, the Indian side, disregarding the objective facts, insisted that China provoked the two incidents, insisted that China mistreated the captured Indian personnel, and even wantonly slandered China as an aggressor, an imperialist, and so on. I must say that our people and our government feel extremely sorry for this serious situation.

Your Excellency's expression of welcome to my suggestion of November 7 for a meeting between the Prime Ministers of the two countries is indeed the hope for an improvement in relations between the two countries. Although there are differences of opinion between our two countries on the border issue, I believe that this will not hinder the Prime Ministers of the two countries from holding talks, but rather requires that these talks be realized as soon as possible in order to first reach some principled agreements as guidance for the specific discussion and resolution of the border issue between the two sides. Without this guidance, the specific discussions on the border issue between the two sides run the risk of falling into endless and fruitless disputes. Therefore, I specifically suggest that the Prime Ministers of the two countries hold talks on December 26. If you suggest other dates, I am also willing to consider them. As for the location of the talks, if you agree, you can choose any place in China, because there are no activities in China that are hostile to Sino-Indian friendship, and you will be welcomed and respected by our people as a distinguished guest of the Chinese government. If you think that holding talks in China is inconvenient for you, then the location of the talks can also be set in Yangon with the consent of the Burmese government.

Dear Prime Minister! Our two countries are both economically and culturally backward, and we both urgently need to concentrate on long-term peaceful construction at home in order to gradually get rid of the current backward state. We do not need to create tension between our two friendly countries, or against any other country, so as to divert and shift our people's attention from domestic affairs. The world situation is developing in a direction favorable to peace, which excites the people of our two countries and the vast majority of people around the world. But unfortunately, there are still many powerful groups in the world who stubbornly oppose this trend. They are trying to poison the international atmosphere, continue the Cold War and create tensions, set obstacles for East-West talks, slander the peaceful policies of socialist countries, and incite discord between Asian and African countries and socialist countries in order to profit from it. At present, they are obviously trying their best to sow discord between China and India. Under this situation, the prompt meeting between the Prime Ministers of the two countries is not only our undeniable responsibility to the people of the two countries, but also our undeniable responsibility to world peace.

With highest regards.
                                             Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai (signed)

    周恩来总理写信答复印度总理尼赫鲁
    提出和平解决中印边界争端首要步骤  建议两国总理本月二十六日举行会谈
    中国政府本着和解和走向全线撤军的愿望，准备同意首先在有争议的朗久、巴里加斯等所有边境地点双方不派驻武装人员；欢迎印方关于双方停止边境巡逻的建议，希望这项建议适用于全部边境——印方关于中国和印度拉达克接壤地区的单独建议是没有理由的、不公平的——中国一贯忠实于和平共处原则，不会侵占别国一寸土地。在边境冲突发生后，中国政府为了维护中印友谊，一直采取克制态度，期望同印度政府在友好谈判中解决这些争端。对于印方不顾事实，谩骂中国的严重情况表示极大遗憾——中印两国都迫切需要专心致志于和平建设，我们不需要在两国之间，或者对任何其他国家制造紧张关系。
    新华社18日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来12月17日就中印边界问题答复印度总理尼赫鲁11月16日的来信，周总理的信全文如下：新德里印度共和国总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生阁下亲爱的总理先生：
    感谢你1959年11月16日的来信。尽管印度政府关于防止边境冲突的意见同中国政府11月7日的建议还有一定的距离，而且其中一部分意见显然缺乏公平，但是，你在来信中表示愿意设法避免一切边境冲突，用和平的方法解决两国的边界争端，这是令人高兴的。
    中国政府11月7日提出的两国武装部队各自从全部边境后撤二十公里的建议，是为了彻底消除边境冲突的难以完全预见的危险，根本改变目前两国在边境武装对峙的紧张局面，创造两国互相信任的良好气氛，这些目的是其他临时办法所不能达到的。在边界划定以前采取这个措施，也丝毫不会约束双方在谈判解决边界问题的时候提出自己的主张。因此，中国政府仍然衷心地希望，为了我们两国在过去和今后千百年的友谊，我们能够就这样的措施达成协议。至于两国武装部队各自后撤多远，中国政府完全愿意同印度政府协商确定一个双方都认为适当的距离。
    在达成上述的协议之前，中国政府本着和解的精神和走向全线撤军的愿望，准备同意首先达成这样的局部解决，那就是，把你在来信中提出的双方不在朗久驻军的建议，同样适用到其他双方有争议的边境地点。在中印边境东段，印度武装人员一度进占朗久，现在仍然占据着兼则马尼。在中印边境西段，印度武装人员至今占据着什普奇山口、巴里加斯、桑、葱沙、波林三多、巨哇、曲惹、香扎、拉不底。这些肯定属于中国的地点，大多数都是在1954年中印两国首次提出和平共处五项原则的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定签订以后，才被印度武装人员陆续占据的。这些地点中的波林三多，还是1954年协定第二条第二款所载明的、由中国政府同意在中国西藏地方阿里地区开放的十个贸易市场之一。现在，既然印度政府对于这些地点的归属有不同的意见，中国政府建议，双方在上述的所有地点都不派驻武装人员。
    在双方取得进一步协议之前，中国政府也欢迎印度政府关于双方边境哨所停止派出巡逻队的建议。事实上，在空喀山口事件以后，中国政府已经指示中国边防部队在中印边境的全部哨所停止派出巡逻队。既然印度方面也采取了同样的步骤，这对于保护两国边境的安宁当然是一个可喜的进步。但是，中国政府希望澄清一点，即停止巡逻的建议应该适用于全部中印边境，而不应该在中国同印度拉达克接壤的一段边境采取不同的办法。
    中国政府对于阁下在中国同印度拉达克接壤的一段边境提出防止冲突的单独建议，感到十分迷惑不解。中国政府认为有必要指出：（1）把这一段边境特殊化是没有理由的。这段边境的双方实际控制线，同中印边境其他地段的双方实际控制线一样，都是很清楚的。事实上，阁下所提到的1956年中国出版的地图，就正确地标明了两国在这一地段的传统边界。除了桑格藏布河畔的巴里加斯地区以外，印度没有占据这段传统边界线以东的任何中国地方。（2）阁下的这一建议是从两国早已同意的暂时维持边境实际存在的状况的原则后退了一大步。要求以大大改变这种状况为消除边境冲突的前提，这就不是缩小争端而是扩大争端。（3）阁下的建议是不公平的。阁下建议，在这一段，中国人员退到印度地图标明的边界线以东，印度人员退到中国地图标明的边界线以西。对于不明真相的人们说来，这个建议似乎是“平等”的。但是，甚至印度最反华的报刊也立即指出，按照这一建议，印度的“让步”只是理论上的。因为所涉及的地区本来不属于印度，印度在那里本来没有可以撤退的人员，而中国却需要从久已属于自己的三万三千多平方公里的领土上撤出守卫边疆的军事人员，以及分属于新疆维吾尔自治区和阗县和西藏自治区阿里地区日土宗的民政人员。（4）这一地区长期属于中国管辖，并且对于中国具有重大意义。从清朝以来，这一地区就是联结新疆和西藏西部广大地区的交通命脉。早在1950年下半年，中国人民解放军的部队就通过这一地区的传统交通线从新疆进入西藏的阿里地区，守卫边疆。九年来，他们一直正常地、频繁地利用着这一交通线取得补给。1956年3月至1957年10月，中国边防部队连同三千多民工，以这个交通线为基础，在极端困难的自然条件下，盘绕高山，架设桥梁，修筑涵洞，从新疆西南部的叶城到西藏西南部的噶大克，建成了长达一千二百多公里的公路。从新疆和西藏和平解放、中国人民解放军的部队在这个地区驻守和巡逻起，直到1958年9月发生印度武装人员侵入该地区的事件为止，前后共八九年之久，中国方面在自己所管辖的这个地区上进行了这样大量的活动；而印度方面却毫无所知。这就有力地证明了这个地区确实是一贯地属于中国而不属于印度的管辖。现在印度政府硬说这个地区向来属于印度的管辖，那是绝对无法令人信服的。
    如果印度政府在了解中国政府的上述观点以后，仍然坚持自己关于这一地区的要求是适宜的，那么，中国政府愿意知道，印度政府是否准备把同样的原则平等地适用于东段边境，也就是说，规定中印双方从所谓麦克马洪线到中国地图所标明的（也是印度地图在长期间所标明的）中印东段边界线中间的地区撤出所有的人员。中国政府至今没有对于所谓麦克马洪线以南的地区提出任何要求作为先决条件或者过渡措施，我感到难以了解的是，为什么印度政府偏要提出关于中国单方面由自己西部边防地区撤出的要求。
    阁下和印度政府曾一再提及印度方面提出的关于中印边界的历史资料。中国方面原来期望，对于阁下9月26日来信和印度外交部11月4日的照会，在两国总理即将举行的会谈中可以提出自己的详细答复，并且认为那样作更为适当。既然两国总理的会谈现在还没有举行，因此中国外交部准备最近提出答复。我不想在这里涉及问题的细节。我只愿意再一次指出这个简单的事实：根据客观的历史，我们两国的整个边界确实没有划定过，否认这一点是不可能的。我注意到，印度方面关于两国边界的叙述故意忽略了许多显而易见的基本事实。例如，他们不提印度测绘局绘制的官方地图，迟至1938年的版本，关于中印边界东段的画法还与中国地图相符，而关于中印边界西段则没有画出任何边界线；甚至在中华人民共和国成立以后出版的1950年、1951年、1952年的版本，对于东段和西段中印边界虽然画得不正确，但是都明确地表示出是未定界。中国政府不明白，印度政府究竟根据什么理由，在最近几年中忽然在自己的地图上把东段和西段的未定界都改成已定界。我详细研究了阁下9月26日来信所引用的大堆资料，但是仍然找不到任何满意的解答。
    中国政府曾经多次指出，中印两国边界漫长而又未经两国政府划定，两国地图互有出入，因此，两国对于边界持有不同的意见是自然的。只要通过友好的协商，这个历史悬案完全不难求得合理的解决。中华人民共和国是一个属于劳动人民的社会主义国家，在这里，那些企图从对外扩张和对外挑衅中取得利益的剥削阶级和亲帝国主义的势力，早已永远失去了活动的地盘。中华人民共和国一贯忠实于和平共处五项原则，决不容许以大国主义的态度对待别国，更不会侵占别国的一寸土地。何况中国有这样广大的领土，而且有一半以上的地区人口稀少，有待大力开发。要设想这样的国家还要向自己邻国的一些荒僻地方去寻找麻烦，就简直是荒谬可笑到极点了。因此，尽管中国同南亚的一些邻国（无论这些国家是大是小，对中国友好不友好）有一些未定的边界，中国从没有也永不会利用这种情况，采取单方面的行动，去对边境实际存在的状况作任何改变。而且，就在边界的悬案解决以后，中国也准备同一切邻国同心协力，创造最和平、最安全和最友好的边界。阁下知道，中国过去的历届政府对于中印东段边境的所谓麦克马洪线是从未承认过的，中华人民共和国政府也同样没有承认它，但是中华人民共和国政府严格遵守自己的声明，决不让自己的武装人员越过这条线，以待边界问题的友好解决。显而易见，中国既然连不久以前（其中一部分迟至1951年）还属于中国西藏地方政府管辖的所谓麦克马洪线以南的大片土地都没有踏入，当然更不会想到要在中印边境西段的任何地点去踏上印度的领土。在那里的中国的军事人员和民政人员，同在别的边境地区一样，只是驻守在自己的土地上。但是，印度政府不但对于边境东段采取拒绝讨论的不合理态度，而且对于边境西段的一块印度从未统治过的土地也提出领土要求，这件事确实引起了中国政府和中国人民的异常的惊讶。中国政府为了维护中印两国的友谊，一直竭力采取克制态度，期望同印度政府在友好的谈判中解决这些争端。就在印度武装人员越入中国境内，先后在马及墩以南和空喀山口以南挑起不幸事件以后，中国政府仍然保持和解的精神，防止事态扩大，并且对于在空喀山口事件中被俘的印度武装人员作了友好的处理。但是，印度方面竟不顾客观事实，硬说两次事件是中国挑起的，硬说中国虐待了印度被俘人员，甚至肆意地谩骂中国是侵略者，是帝国主义者，等等。对于这种严重的情况，我必须说，我国人民和我国政府都感到极大的遗憾。
    阁下表示欢迎我在11月7日提出的两国总理会谈的建议，这确实是两国关系好转的希望所在。尽管我们两国关于边界问题存在着意见分歧，但是，我相信，这决不妨碍两国总理举行会谈，恰恰要求这一会谈早日实现，以便首先取得一些原则性的协议，作为双方具体讨论和解决边界问题的指导。没有这种指导，双方对于边界问题的具体讨论就有陷入无休止的、无结果的争论的危险。因此，我具体建议，两国总理在12月26日举行会谈。如果你建议其他的日期，我也愿意考虑。会谈的地点，如果你同意，可以选择在中国的任何地方，因为在中国没有仇视中印友好的活动，你将作为中国政府的贵宾受到我国人民的欢迎和尊敬。如果你认为在中国会谈对你不便，那么，在征得缅甸政府同意的情况下，会谈地点也可以定在仰光。
    亲爱的总理先生！我们两国在经济上和文化上都还很落后，我们都迫切地需要专心致志于国内的长期的和平建设，以便逐步摆脱目前的落后状态。我们不需要在我们两个友好国家之间，或者对任何其他国家，制造紧张关系，以致分散和转移我们人民对国内事务的注意。世界形势正在向有利于和平的方向发展，这是我们两国人民和全世界绝大多数人所感觉兴奋的。但是可惜，世界上还有不少有势力的集团顽固地反对这种趋势，他们力图毒化国际气氛，继续进行冷战和制造紧张局势，为东西方会谈设置障碍，诽谤社会主义国家的和平政策，煽动亚非国家和社会主义国家之间的不和，以便从中取利。目前，他们显然是在中国和印度之间竭力进行挑拨离间。在这种形势下，两国总理的迅速会谈，不但是我们对于两国人民的不容推诿的责任，也是我们对于世界和平的不容推诿的责任。
    致崇高的敬意。
