    Do Not Persecute Patriots of the "Sunagawa Incident"
    Tokyo Mass Rally Protests the Supreme Court's Unreasonable Judgment
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - Eight thousand people from all walks of life in Japan held a rally in Tokyo today to protest the Supreme Court's unreasonable judgment on the "Sunagawa Incident" and to express their opposition to revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    Participants in the rally included workers, students, monks, and citizens. Representatives from neighboring prefectures also rushed to participate in the rally by bus, motorcycle, and bicycle.
    The conference passed a statement pointing out that today's judgment shows that the Supreme Court has abandoned its responsibility to protect the Constitution from being undermined and has succumbed to pressure from the reactionary government. The Japanese people, who enjoy national sovereignty, will never recognize this judgment.
    The statement said that the Supreme Court's judgment is a hostile provocation against the Japanese people. It is no accident that this judgment was made at a time when the Japanese people and the Nobusuke Kishi government are engaged in a fierce struggle over the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The statement condemned the Supreme Court's judgment as an impermissible political judgment.
    The statement emphasized that the Nobusuke Kishi government is attempting to use the Supreme Court's judgment to strengthen its suppression of the people's forces who are fighting against the revision of the "Security Treaty." The statement emphasized that the strength of the Japanese people will not be affected by today's deceptive judgment. They will develop national unified action to a higher stage and carry the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" to the end.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - The Japanese Supreme Court announced today that it was overturning the Tokyo District Court's first instance judgment on the "Sunagawa Incident," which stated that the U.S. military stationed in Japan and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" were in violation of the Japanese Constitution, and demanded that the Tokyo District Court retry the case.
    In March of this year, the Tokyo District Court ruled that the U.S. military stationed in Japan and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" were in violation of the Japanese Constitution, and that the seven patriots from Sunagawa Town who were arrested in the summer of 1957 for opposing the expansion of the Tachikawa Air Force Base by the U.S. military were innocent. This judgment embarrassed the Japanese and U.S. authorities, who feared that this fair judgment would have an impact that would shake the "legitimate status" of the U.S. military stationed in Japan.
    The defendants in the "Sunagawa Incident" immediately issued a statement on the judgment expressing serious protest. The statement accused the Supreme Court's judgment of acting as a running dog of the Nobusuke Kishi government and shielding the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    Akio Date, the presiding judge of the Tokyo District Court, pointed out that he would never consider his initial judgment on the "Sunagawa Incident" to be wrong.
    Yoshio Shiga, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said that this judgment shows that the Supreme Court has abandoned its qualifications as a court of an independent country and has degenerated into a mouthpiece for the United States.

    不准迫害“砂川事件”爱国者
    东京群众集会抗议最高裁判所的无理判决
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：八千名日本各界人士今天在东京举行集会，抗议最高裁判所对“砂川事件”的无理判决，并且表示反对修改日美“安全条约”。
    参加大会的有工人、学生、僧侣以及市民。邻近各县的代表也乘大汽车、摩托车和自行车赶来参加这次大会。
    大会通过声明指出，今天所作出的判决表明，最高裁判所已经放弃了保卫宪法免遭破坏的责任，向反动政府的压力屈服。享有国家主权的日本人民决不承认这个判决。
    声明说，最高裁判所的判决是对日本人民的敌对挑衅。正当日本人民和岸信介政府之间在修改日美“安全条约”问题上进行着激烈斗争的时候，作出这种判决，这不是偶然的。声明谴责最高裁判所的判决是一个不能容许的政治性判决。
    声明强调指出，岸信介政府企图利用最高裁判所的这种判决来加强对正在为反对修改“安全条约”而斗争的人民力量的镇压活动。声明强调指出，日本人民的力量不会由于今天的欺骗性判决而受影响。他们将使全国统一行动发展到更高阶段，把反对修改“安全条约”的斗争进行到底。
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本最高裁判所今天宣布取消东京地方裁判所关于驻日美军和日美“安全条约”是违反日本宪法的“砂川事件”第一审判决，要求东京地方裁判所重新审判这个案件。
    东京地方裁判所在今年3月判决，美军驻在日本和日美“安全条约”是违反日本宪法的，1957年夏季砂川町人民因反对驻日美军扩大立川空军基地而被逮捕的七名爱国者无罪。这个判决使日美当局感到狼狈，他们唯恐这个公正判决会产生动摇驻日美军的“合法地位”的影响。
    “砂川事件”被告立即就这个判决发表声明表示严重的抗议。声明指责说，最高裁判所的判决表明它在充当岸信介政府的走狗和庇护日美“安全条约”。
    东京地方裁判所裁判长伊达秋雄指出，他决不认为当初他对“砂川事件”的判决是错误的。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员志贺义雄说，这个判决表明，最高裁判所抛弃了作为独立国家的法院的资格，堕落成为美国的传声筒。
