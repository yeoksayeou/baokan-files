Luda Studies Susceptible Children's Situation to Prescribe the Right Medicine

The first preventive administration of placental powder to all susceptible children in the Zhongshan District has ended, and the entire district is conducting the second preventive administration. The Friendship Street section responsible by the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital has completed the second administration due to the hard work of the medical staff and is preparing for the third administration. In order to facilitate the management of susceptible children, they drew a "Distribution Map of Measles-Susceptible Children." Looking at this map, the number and distribution of susceptible children in the entire street are clear at a glance. At the same time, in order to grasp the health status of all residents in the street, they also established "Health Household Registration" on a household basis, and the health status of each household is recorded on it; but they still feel dissatisfied and are preparing to establish "Health Cards" for each person to have a better understanding in their minds and facilitate prevention. In the Shahekou District, in order to do a good job in the key prevention objects, doctors often visit homes. In addition, they also established "Epidemiological Investigation Cards for Measles Patients." Every measles patient must fill out this card. In this way, on the one hand, it can be learned who the sick children have been in contact with, which is convenient for managing contact with susceptible children; on the other hand, it can also be learned where the sick children were infected from, so as to take preventive measures. In preventive administration, in the absence of specific drugs at present, they adopt the method of combining Chinese and Western medicines.

In order to eliminate diphtheria this year, preventive vaccination work has been fully carried out for children from six months to eight years old in the city. So far, the first preventive vaccination work in the urban area has been fully completed. According to preliminary statistics, more than 90% of the children who should be vaccinated have been vaccinated. At present, each district is conducting a review and finishing work on the one hand, and has begun the second preventive vaccination on the other hand. Shahekou District has great determination, sufficient energy, and does a meticulous and good job in this preventive vaccination work. Their slogan is: Set up more vaccination points, use evenings and holidays to carry out vaccination in a big way, and strive to achieve 100% vaccination of all children who should be vaccinated. In the process of vaccination, they changed the original setting of vaccination points according to residents' committees to setting up points according to residents' groups, which greatly facilitated the masses.

    早动手　争主动　防治冬春传染病
    天津结合生产大抓防病工作
    据新华社天津6日电　天津市以工厂企业和水利工地为重点，积极展开以预防冬季传染病为中心的除害灭病活动。
    天津市人民委员会早在10月份就召开了冬季卫生工作会议，对冬季除害灭病工作作了部署。各区、县以工厂企业和水利工地为重点，结合生产大抓防病工作。各区、县以及大部分工厂企业、街道和人民公社，先后建立或加强了由党委直接领导的除害灭病指挥机构，积极采取措施开展预防冬季传染病工作。全市加强疫情报告和统计分析工作，主动掌握防病工作。现在，天津市区已基本做到单位、车间、地段甚至大院都有了疫情报告员；大部分医院和门诊部由专人管理疫情材料，定期进行分析。全市还建立了流行感冒观察站，负责观察掌握流行感冒的发病规律。同时，分批分区训练了红十字卫生员，通过他们在群众中开展广泛防病宣传。全市还调查了麻疹易感儿童，进行儿童体格检查，确定幼弱病患者作为重点保护对象，做出防治计划。
    配合郊区各县区冬修水利工作，天津市医务部门在水利工地建立了卫生组织，分派医务人员到工地进行医疗预防工作，做到了平均每五百名民工中有一名医务人员，每五十名民工中训练了一名红十字卫生员。医务人员除了积极防治冬季传染病外，还对民工作了体格检查，注意协助有关部门搞好民工的吃、喝、睡和粪便的处理工作，保证了广大民工的健康。
    南京人人动手除害灭病
    本报讯　南京市采取抓早、抓紧、抓深、抓细、抓透的办法，展开以防治季节性传染病和多发病为中心的爱国卫生运动。目前全市基本上已经做到家喻户晓，人人动手，讲究卫生，无病防病，早期发现，随见随报，隔离治疗，就地扑灭。
    为了保障人民健康和生产建设的飞跃发展，中共南京市委加强了对于防病工作的领导，层层发动，块块贯彻，条条保证，医疗单位划片包干。街道办事处成立了防病小组，居民委员会由街道卫生所的地段医师分工负责，配合红十字卫生站工作，各居民小组都有红十字会员及疫情报告员，形成了强大的卫生专业队伍与严密的疫情报告网。医务人员深入居民家中讲解防病常识，小学校、托儿所、幼儿园加强了晨间检查，实行盐开水漱口，定期用碘酒、碘甘油涂喉或青霉素喷雾，食具严格消毒，小朋友出门都戴上了口罩，公共场所及儿童活动场所全部实行湿性扫除，加强通风换气与空气消毒。
    居民群众的防病活动也广泛开展，地段预防接种一般已做到应接种人口的90％以上。除涂喉、喷雾等药物预防措施外，还采用多种中药防病及针灸防病。发现病人就近送院隔离，彻底治疗，需要转院的事先都经过急救处理，病具严密消毒，对接触病人的人，还要进行带菌检查及医药处理。
    河南采取措施提高防疫质量
    本报讯　河南省展开防止冬春季传染病工作，控制白喉、麻疹、猩红热、流行性感冒、流行性脑脊髓膜炎及百日咳等病的发生与流行。为了充分保证这一任务的顺利完成，各地除加强健康检查和疫情报告工作外，又抓紧训练基层脱产和不脱产的卫生人员，以提高防疫工作质量，同时，还大力印发宣传材料，利用广播站、报社等对居民，集体福利机构——敬老院、幼儿园、托儿所，水利建设工地，公共娱乐场所等进行广泛宣传。
    对于传染病发生后的管理措施，各地也根据具体情况作了细致的安排：洛阳市在五个医院中抽出一部分病床，作为冬春季传染病的隔离病床，由市卫生防疫站统一掌握；鹤璧市规定对传染病人实行登门治疗，以防交叉感染，广大农村一般都采取就地隔离，专人巡回治疗、护理的办法，实行有病村和无病村，有病户和无病户，病人和健康人，确诊病人和可疑病人之间的严格隔离。

    旅大研究易感儿情况对症下药
    本报讯　旅大市的各级卫生部门和广大医务人员，积极开展预防肝炎、麻疹、白喉等冬季传染病工作。
  早在10月间，中共旅大市委和旅大市人委联合召开的干部大会上，即对冬季除害灭病运动作了部署。在麻疹和白喉的预防工作上，为了减少麻疹发生和降低死亡率，除了采取重点保护乳、幼、病、弱儿童外，还提出加强对接触易感儿的管理等办法。目前全市对易感儿调查工作已告完成，广大医务人员正采取各种办法进行防治和深入居民中进行宣传。中山区对所有的易感儿第一次胎盘粉预防性投药已经结束，全区正进行第二次预防性投药。妇产科医院负责的友好街道地段，由于医护人员的干劲足，第二次投药已经结束，正准备进行第三次投药。他们为了便于掌握易感儿，绘制了“麻疹易感儿分布图”，一看这张图，对全街道的易感儿数字和分布情况，一目了然。同时他们为了掌握全街道居民的健康状况，还以户为单位建立了“保健户口”，每家每户的健康状况都记载在这上面；但他们还感到不满足，还准备为每人建立“保健卡片”，做到心中更有数，便于预防。沙河口区各个地段，为做好重点预防对象的工作，大夫经常登门访问。另外，他们还建立了“麻疹患者流行病学调查卡片”每个麻疹病人都要填写这个卡片。这样做一方面可以了解到病儿都接触过谁，便于管理接触易感儿；另方面还可以了解病儿是从什么地方传染来的，以便采取预防措施。在预防性投药上，在目前尚无特效药的情况下，他们采取中西药并用的方法。
    为了在今年内消灭白喉，对全市六个月以上到八周岁的儿童，全面开展了预防接种工作。到目前为止，市内区第一次预防接种工作已经全部结束，据初步统计，应接种的儿童已经达到90％以上。当前各区一方面进行复查扫尾，另一方面已开始第二次预防接种。沙河口区在这次预防接种工作中，决心大、干劲足，做的又细又好。他们的口号是：多设接种点，利用晚间和假日大搞接种，力争达到百分之百的应接种的儿童全部接种。在进行接种工作中，他们把原来按居民委员会设接种点改为按居民小组设点，大大的便利了群众。
