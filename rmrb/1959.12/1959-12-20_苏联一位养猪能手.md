A Pig-Raising Expert in the Soviet Union

In the Shevchenko Collective Farm in Zolochev District, Lvov Oblast, western Ukraine, there is a very outstanding pig-raising expert named Yaroslav Semenovich Chytyi. Because of his love for pig-raising, bold research, and improved feeding methods, he has developed from being able to raise only about thirty or forty pigs to now being able to feed five hundred pigs simultaneously. The pigs he feeds are all strong and fat, gaining weight quickly day and night. Chytyi originally planned to sell 50,000 kilograms of pork to the state in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan. As a result, he sold 50,200 kilograms in the first ten months of this year, completing and exceeding the original plan ahead of schedule. Now he has decided to sell 100,000 kilograms of pork to the state in 1960. By 1961, he will strive to raise 2,500 pigs by himself.

Why can Chytyi feed so many pigs by himself? Is it because he is an old member of the farm or an old pig-raising "expert"? Not at all. Chytyi was originally a demobilized soldier and a Communist Party member who worked as a miner in a coal mine. Three years ago, because the doctor did not allow him to continue working underground, he voluntarily came to his hometown's Shevchenko Collective Farm. The farm members warmly received him. As soon as Chytyi arrived at the farm, he worked actively, and the party members of the farm unanimously elected him as the secretary of the primary party organization.

At that time, the pig-raising business of the Shevchenko Collective Farm was not given enough attention. The breeding and growth of pigs were very slow, the pigsties were quite dirty, a lot of labor was spent, and the cost was alarmingly high, with the cost of 100 kilograms of pork reaching 1,000 rubles.

After discovering this phenomenon, Chytyi proposed to the farm committee: "Please give me some pigs to raise, and I will personally participate in the feeding." The farm committee agreed with his opinion and sent him to work at the pig farm.

When Chytyi came to the pig farm, he encountered a series of difficult problems at the beginning. What kind of feed should be used to feed the pigs, and how to manage them—these were basic knowledge for a breeder, but he knew nothing about them. At first, he didn't feed many pigs, and he ran from one pigsty to another all day long, feeding, watering, and cleaning, and he couldn't keep up at all. The pigs were not raised well either. These difficulties did not discourage Chytyi. He knew that if he did not have enough feeding knowledge, he could not be a good breeder. So, on the one hand, he took time to read many books on pig-raising methods, and on the other hand, he boldly studied how to thoroughly improve feeding methods. He thought: To increase the number of pigs and raise them well, it is necessary to use mechanical tools to replace manual feeding. Therefore, he began to study and establish a strict "life program" for raising and managing pigs.

He first divided the pigs he raised into three categories: the first category was pigs from two to four months old, the second category was pigs from four to six months old, and the third category was large meat pigs over six months old. He implemented feeding in separate sheds in different periods, with fixed times and quantities. Each type of pig was fixed in each pigsty. Each pigsty was connected to an automatic water supply pipe. In addition, he also installed a conveying tool for delivering feed. When it was time to feed, Chytyi pushed the automatic feeding tool and fed the pigs according to the feeding amount of piglets and large pigs. Each pigsty was connected to an open-air small flat ground, and after feeding, the pigs were driven there to "walk." There was also an automatic water supply pipe installed there. Chytyi had a fixed schedule for feeding the pigs and cleaning, and he worked in an orderly manner, thereby improving labor efficiency. He also paid great attention to hygiene to prevent pig diseases.

In order to reduce production costs, Chytyi paid great attention to replacing fine feed with cheap rough feed, combining fine and rough feed, feeding in a timely manner, and saving feeding procedures. In summer, he used various green fodder and high-yield crop corn silage to feed the pigs, and the production cost was greatly reduced. This year, the cost of every 100 kilograms of pork fed by Chytyi was reduced to 224 rubles, which is equivalent to a quarter of the previous cost.

Chytyi's advanced pig-raising methods have been greatly valued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the vast number of collective farm members. Many farms from various places have sent delegations to visit and learn. Not long ago, Comrade Khrushchev also visited this farm. In a conversation with Chytyi, Khrushchev praised his achievements.

    苏联一位养猪能手
    在乌克兰西部里沃夫州佐洛切夫区谢夫钦科集体农庄里，有一个非常出色的养猪能手。他叫雅罗斯洛夫·谢麦诺维奇·契季。由于他热爱养猪工作，大胆研究，改进饲养方法，从一个人只能饲养约三、四十头猪，发展到现在他一个人能同时喂养五百头猪。他所喂养的猪个个都茁壮肥胖，昼夜间长肉都很快。契季原定在七年计划第一年里交售给国家五万公斤猪肉，结果在今年前十个月内就交售了五万二百公斤，提前并超额完成了原计划。现在他又决定在1960年里交售给国家十万公斤猪肉。到1961年时，他争取一人喂养二千五百头猪。
    契季为什么一个人能喂养好那么多的猪呢，是不是由于他是个老庄员，或者是个老养猪“专家”？完全不是。契季原是一个转业军人、共产党员，早先在煤矿上当矿工。三年前，由于医生不允许他继续下井劳动，于是他自动来到自己家乡的谢夫钦科集体农庄。庄员们热情地接待了他。契季一到农庄就积极工作，农庄的党员们一致选他为基层党组织书记。
    当时，谢夫钦科集体农庄的养猪事业没有被足够的重视。猪的繁殖与成长都很慢，猪圈相当污秽，劳动力花得多，成本高得惊人，一百公斤猪肉的成本竟达到了一千卢布。
    契季在发现了这个现象后，就向农庄委员会提出：“请交给我一部分猪吧，由我亲自来参加喂养”。农庄委员会同意了他的意见，派他到了养猪场工作。
    契季来到养猪场，一开头就遇到了一连串的困难问题，应该用什么饲料来喂猪，怎样来管理它们这些是一个饲养员的基本知识，但是对他来说还是一窍不通。起初，他喂的猪数量不多，成天从这个猪圈跑到那个猪圈，喂料、给水、搞清洁，根本忙不过来。猪也养得不好。这些困难并没有把契季吓倒。他知道，如果饲养知识不足，是不能当好一个饲养员的。于是他一方面抽空读了许多有关养猪方法的书籍，一方面又大胆研究如何彻底改善喂养方法。他想：要提高养猪的数量并养得好，一定要利用机械工具来代替手工喂养。于是，他开始钻研，建立了一套饲养和管理猪的严格的“生活程序。”
    他先把自己喂养的猪分成三类：第一类是二个月到四个月的猪，第二类是四个月到六个月的猪，第三类是六个月以上的大肉猪。对它们实行分棚分期、定时定量的喂养。每一类猪分别固定在各个猪圈。每一个猪圈都接有自动给水管。此外，他还安装了送饲料的输送工具，一到喂料时间，契季就推上自动的喂料工具，根据猪仔、大猪的喂料量分别喂料。每一个猪圈都通连一块露天小平地，喂食后，把猪赶到那里“散步”。那儿也装有自动给水管。契季给猪喂料和搞清洁都有固定时间表，工作得有条不紊，从而提高了劳动效率。他也非常注意清洁卫生，防止了猪疫病。
    为了降低生产成本，契季非常注意用廉价的粗饲料代替精饲料，精粗搭配，适时喂养，并且节省了喂养手续。夏天，他多用各种青草饲料和高产作物玉蜀黍青贮饲料来喂猪，生产成本大为降低。今年契季所喂养的每一百公斤的猪肉成本降到了二百二十四卢布，即相当于早先的四分之一。
    契季的先进养猪方法受到了苏共中央和广大农庄庄员的极大重视。各地许多农庄派代表团前往参观学习。不久前，赫鲁晓夫同志也访问了这个农庄。在与契季谈话时，赫鲁晓夫赞扬了他所取得的成就。
