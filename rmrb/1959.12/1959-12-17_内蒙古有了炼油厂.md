Inner Mongolia now has an oil refinery. This is the first petroleum plant in the Ordos Plateau's Ikezhao League.

This plant refines oil shale produced in the Ikezhao League and can produce 3,500 tons of gasoline, kerosene, light and heavy diesel oil annually. It has three workshops: mining, refining, and sulfuric acid production. Mining and material transportation are done manually, while everything from ore crushing to oil refining is mechanized.

    内蒙古有了炼油厂
    内蒙古自治区第一个炼油厂正式投入生产。这是鄂尔多斯高地伊克昭盟的石油一厂。
    这个厂用伊克昭盟出产的油母页岩炼油，每年可以生产汽油、煤油、轻重柴油等三千五百吨。有采矿、炼油、硫酸炼制三个车间，采矿运料用人工，从矿石粉碎到炼油都用机械。
