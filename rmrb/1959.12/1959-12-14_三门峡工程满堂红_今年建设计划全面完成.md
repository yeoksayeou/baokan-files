Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, December 13th: The entire workforce of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau, after more than eleven months of hard work and skillful execution, has comprehensively completed this year's engineering construction plan. By December 9th, the bureau's total annual investment, concrete pouring, metal structure and large-scale construction machinery installation, and aggregate mining had all fulfilled the state plan, and even slightly exceeded it. The quality of the projects all met design standards, and savings plans were overfulfilled by 94%.

The early and comprehensive completion of this year's plan for the Sanmenxia Yellow River Water Control Project, particularly the early completion of the concrete pouring task, has laid the foundation for the dam to play a full flood control role during the next flood season.

After the Second Congress of the Communist Party of China Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau was held in February of this year, the fighting goal of the dam partially blocking the flood in 1959 was put forward. With the strong support of the people across the country and the direct assistance of Soviet experts, the entire workforce launched a socialist labor competition of high-speed construction. In March, it broke through the mark of pouring 100,000 cubic meters of concrete per month, and continued to rise in April and May, achieving high output, high quality, safety, and complete success in savings. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Engineering Bureau Party Committee opposed Rightist tendencies and boosted morale. The workers were enthusiastic and reversed the situation in which the construction speed had slowed down in June and July, so that the amount of concrete pouring rose month by month, ensuring the early completion of this year's construction plan.

    三门峡工程满堂红
    今年建设计划全面完成
    新华社三门峡13日电　三门峡工程局全体职工，经过十一个多月的苦干、巧干，已全面完成了今年的工程建设计划。到12月9日，全局全年总投资、混凝土浇筑、金属结构和大型施工机械安装、砂石开采都完成了国家计划，并且略有超额；工程质量都合乎设计标准；节约计划超额94％完成。
    黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程今年的计划提前全面完成，特别是混凝浇筑任务的提前完成，为大坝争取在明年汛期起全部拦洪作用奠定了基础。
    今年2月召开的中共三门峡工程局第二届代表大会，提出了1959年大坝部分拦洪的奋斗目标后，全局职工在全国人民大力支援和苏联专家的直接帮助下，掀起了高速度建设社会主义的劳动竞赛，3月份突破了月浇筑混凝土十万立方米的大关，4、5月继续上升，实现了高产、优质、安全、节约满堂红。在党的八届八中全会以后，工程局党委反右倾、鼓干劲，职工们群情焕发，扭转了6、7月份建设速度一度减慢的局面，使混凝土浇筑量又月月上升，保证了提前完成今年建设计划。
