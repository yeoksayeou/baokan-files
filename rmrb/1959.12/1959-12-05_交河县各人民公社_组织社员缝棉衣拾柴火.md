People's Communes in Jiaohe County
    Organize Members to Sew Cotton Clothes and Gather Firewood

As the cold winter approaches, the communes in Jiaohe County, Hebei Province, have already helped the majority of their members solve the problems of cotton clothing and firewood for heating.

The Jiaohe County Party Committee is very concerned about the lives of its members and convened two telephone conferences early on to arrange for the winter living arrangements of the members. The county also organized twenty-three winter living visitation teams to visit the canteens, kindergartens, and member families of each production team. After discovering that some members of the communes were insufficiently prepared with cotton clothing and lacked firewood for heating, the county party committee immediately instructed the communes to actively resolve the problems. After receiving the instructions from the county party committee, the Fucheng Commune organized 779 dismantling, washing, and sewing groups and rushed to make 5,700 pieces of cotton clothing in five days. The communes also took active measures for members who lacked clothing and bedding. For example, the Gucheng Commune solved the problem of more than 300 pieces of cotton clothing for members in difficulty.

The communes also mobilized the majority of their members to gather grass and store firewood. The Jianqiao Commune proposed the slogan "Bend over in autumn, better than running three times in winter," and the entire commune gathered 3.18 million jin of firewood in ten days. The Wangji Commune mobilized all members to launch a crash firewood collection campaign, collecting 1.5 million jin of firewood every day. Seven communes, including Shuangmiao, have an average of 1,300 jin of firewood per person, which basically solves the problem of firewood for heating in winter.

    交河县各人民公社
    组织社员缝棉衣拾柴火
    寒冬逼近，河北交河县各公社已帮助广大社员解决了棉衣和烧柴取暖等问题。
    交河县委十分关心社员的生活，很早就召开过两次安排社员过冬生活的电话会议，全县还组织了二十三个冬季生活访问团，到各生产队的食堂、幼儿园和社员家庭访问。当时发现各公社都有一些社员棉衣准备不足，缺乏取暖烧柴情况后，县委马上指示各公社要积极解决。阜城公社接到县委指示后，组织了七百七十九个拆洗缝纫组，五天赶作棉衣五千七百件。对于缺衣少被的社员，各公社也采取了积极措施。如古城公社即为有困难的社员解决了三百多件棉衣。
    各公社还发动广大社员打草贮柴。建桥公社提出“秋天弯弯腰，胜如冬天跑三遭”的口号，全社十天打柴三百一十八万斤。王集公社发动全社人员突击拾柴，每天拾柴一百五十万斤。双庙等七个公社平均每人已有烧柴一千三百斤，基本上解决了冬季烧柴取暖的问题。
