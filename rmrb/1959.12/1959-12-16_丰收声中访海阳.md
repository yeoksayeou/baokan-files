Visiting Haiyang Amidst the Sounds of Harvest
By Our Correspondent Hu Benying

Not long ago, we visited Haiyang Province, which achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of late rice this year. Facing the gentle sea breeze blowing from the direction of Haiphong, the car sped along the flat and wide highway. The rice fields on both sides of the road were full of the harvesting army. Large swathes of rice had already been cut down, and many farmers were busy carrying them back to the villages. On the roads near the villages, farmers were using the smooth surfaces to thresh and dry the rice.

After more than an hour's drive, we arrived at the Haiyang Provincial Administrative Committee. In a spacious reception room, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the province warmly received us and introduced us to the achievements Haiyang Province has made on the agricultural front in recent years.

Haiyang Province is one of the famous rice-producing areas in the northern plain of Vietnam. 90% of the province's 860,000 people rely on agriculture for their livelihood. During the war of resistance, this was a guerrilla zone. Due to the enemy's frantic mopping-up operations, tens of thousands of people were killed and large amounts of rice paddies were abandoned. Especially in 1945, countless people starved to death in the great famine created by the Japanese and French imperialists. However, the indomitable people of Haiyang Province, under the strong leadership of the Labor Party, dealt a heavy blow to the enemy: In the nine years of resistance, they eliminated more than 40,000 French colonial soldiers.

The Vice-Chairman of the province said that after the restoration of peace, the people of the province immediately threw themselves into the upsurge of restoring production. In recent years, despite suffering from varying degrees of natural disasters every year, the output of agricultural production has increased year by year. In 1939, the year with the highest yield during the French rule, the average yield of early rice was 13.2 quintals per hectare, and late rice was more than 15 quintals. In 1955, the first year after the restoration of peace, both early and late rice exceeded the highest yield in the past. In 1957, the average yield of early rice was 19.3 quintals per hectare, and late rice was 22.2 quintals. This year is an even bigger bumper year. The average yield of early rice this year is 22.67 quintals per hectare, and more than 90% of late rice has now been harvested, and it is estimated that the average yield per hectare will be at least 28 quintals or more.

Listening to the Vice-Chairman's words, we noticed the various certificates and medals inlaid in glass frames on the four walls of the reception room. It turned out that because the people of Haiyang Province have made outstanding contributions in agriculture, water conservancy, and other aspects, they have been rewarded by the state every year for several years.

The Vice-Chairman continued, "This year, the rice yield in Haiyang Province averages 483 kilograms per person, an increase of 34% compared to 1939. The three-year plan proposed by the state stipulates that an average of 500 kilograms of rice per person should be achieved by 1960, and we have completed 96% of the state plan in two years."

Why did we achieve such a bumper harvest this year? The Chairman of the province told us that the natural conditions in Haiyang Province this year were not good, and floods, especially droughts, brought great difficulties to agricultural production. The fundamental reason for the bumper harvest is that the Party led the peasants onto the road of cooperation. In the winter of 1958, 81% of the farmers in Haiyang Province participated in mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives. This spring, 1,286 agricultural cooperatives were established in the province, with 74,360 households joining the cooperatives; and this autumn, after the great debate on the two roads, the number of agricultural cooperatives increased to 1,561, with 96,266 households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 54% of the total number of households. Due to cooperation, the members collectively fought effectively against natural disasters; various agricultural cooperatives carried out mass movements to build water conservancy projects in a planned and led manner, greatly demonstrating the superiority of being organized; at the same time, the members accepted advanced farming methods, broke with conservative ideas, implemented deep plowing and close planting, and paid attention to fertilization. In this way, the peasants won this year's bumper harvest.

In order to allow us to personally understand the actual situation in the countryside, the Vice-Chairman accompanied us to Zhangcun Township, Fangxing County, not far from the city, to visit the agricultural cooperatives in the afternoon, despite his busy schedule.

Zhangcun Township has a total of six agricultural cooperatives, all of which are general cooperatives, not the most advanced. Soon after leaving the city, we arrived at this village nestled in a patch of green bamboo groves. The Party Secretary of the township looked only in his thirties, with a swarthy face, a sturdy physique, and his sincere and simple manner of speaking. Without asking, one could tell that he came from a peasant background. He told us that Zhangcun Township has a total of 885 households, and currently 53.5% of the total number of households have joined the agricultural cooperatives, of which 85% of the households in Zhangcun have joined the agricultural cooperatives. Because of the improvement in farming methods this year, the average yield of late rice can reach 31 quintals per hectare, more than double the increase compared to last year, thus basically solving the grain problem of the whole township. He excitedly said that the province has now decided to use their township as a demonstration township and has given them a tractor. Looking forward to the future, he said that the people of the whole township are full of infinite confidence, and under the leadership of the respected President Ho Chi Minh and the Labor Party, they will surely achieve even greater harvests next year.

Mentioning the past of this township, it has a tragic history. Before liberation, landlords and rich peasants occupied 730 of the 845 Vietnamese mu of land in the township, and 90% of the peasants did not have an inch of land. Because they could not make a living, many peasants were forced to leave their homes and go to South Vietnam to find a livelihood. Even now, more than 100 people are still wandering in South Vietnam. During the great famine of 1945, more than 500 people starved to death in this fertile land, especially in Zhangcun, where more than 150 people starved to death.

The people of this township, who have suffered deeply, expressed sincere love and gratitude for today's new life and the Labor Party. The experience of Comrade Chen Wenhan, a township cadre who spoke with us, can fully illustrate this point. Chen Wenhan is 32 years old this year. Before liberation, his family had no land or house. In the great famine of 1945, his parents, brothers, and sisters all starved to death, and only he survived. After liberation, he was allocated land, and this year he built a new thatched house in January. After joining the agricultural cooperative, his income has increased year by year. This year, his family received 280 kilograms of early rice and 870 kilograms of late rice, an increase of almost 50% compared to last year. He said, "Today we can live such a good life, and we will never forget the Party!" This is also the reason why the cooperation of Zhangcun Township has developed the fastest. A folk song composed by a peasant sings well: "Holding gold in your hand is not reliable, joining the agricultural cooperative gets food and clothing!"

When we bid farewell to the farmers harvesting in the fields, the sun was already setting. The sunset glow dyed half the sky red, the water in the rice fields sparkled with brilliant gold, and in the distance and near, we could still see the harvesting crowds and hear the banging sound of threshing.

    丰收声中访海阳
    本报记者　胡本英
    不久前，我们到今年晚稻获得空前大丰收的海阳省去参观访问。迎着从海防方面吹来的习习海风，汽车在平坦宽阔的公路上飞驰。公路两旁的稻田里，到处是收割大军。大片稻子已经割倒，许多农民忙着往村子里挑。在靠近村子的公路上，农民正借用光滑的路面来晒打稻子。
    车行一个多小时，到达了海阳省行政委员会。在一间宽敞的会客室里，省主席和副主席热情地接待了我们，向我们介绍了海阳省几年来在农业战线上取得的成就。
    海阳省是越南北方平原著名产稻区之一，全省八十六万人口中有90％的人靠农业为生。抗战时期，这里是游击区，由于敌人的疯狂扫荡，成千上万的人被杀害，大量的稻田荒废了，特别是1945年，在日、法帝国主义者制造的大饥荒中，无数人活活饿死。但是，不屈的海阳省人民在劳动党的坚强领导下，给了敌人沉重的打击：九年抗战中，消灭了法国殖民军四万多名。
    省副主席说，和平恢复后，全省人民立即投入了恢复生产的热潮。几年来，尽管年年都遭受到程度不同的自然灾害，但农业生产的产量一年比一年增加。1939年是法国人统治时期产量最高的一年，这里的早稻平均每公顷产量为十三点二公担，晚稻为十五公担多。而和平恢复后的第一年——1955年，无论早稻、晚稻都超过了过去的最高产量。1957年的早稻平均每公顷产量为十九点三公担，晚稻为二十二点二公担。今年更是大丰收的一年。今年的早稻平均每公顷产量是二十二点六七公担，晚稻现在已收割90％以上，估计平均每公顷产量至少可达二十八公担以上。
    听着副主席的话，我们注意到会客室四壁镶在玻璃框里的各种奖状和奖章。原来由于海阳省人民在农业、水利等各方面作出了卓著的贡献，几年来每年都受到国家的奖励。
    副主席接着说，今年海阳省的稻子产量平均每人可达四百八十三公斤，同1939年相比，增加34％。国家提出的三年计划规定，到1960年平均每人要达到五百公斤稻子，而我们在两年内已经完成国家计划的96％了。
    今年为什么会获得这样大丰收呢？省主席告诉我们，今年海阳省的自然条件并不好，水灾、特别是旱灾给农业生产带来很大困难。丰收的根本原因是党领导农民走上合作化道路。海阳省在1958年冬就有81％的农户参加了变工组和农业社。今年春季，全省成立了一千二百八十六个农业社，入社农户达七万四千三百六十户；而今秋经过两条道路大辩论，农业社增加到一千五百六十一个，入社农户达九万六千二百六十六户，占总农户的54％。由于合作化，社员们集体地同自然灾害进行了有成效的斗争；各个农业社有计划地有领导地开展了兴修水利的群众运动，大大发挥了组织起来的优越性；同时，社员们接受了先进耕作方法，打破了保守思想，实行深耕密植，注意施肥。这样，农民就夺得了今年的大丰收。
    为了使我们能够亲自了解农村的实际情况，下午，副主席在百忙中陪同我们到离城不远的方兴县张村乡参观农业社。
    张村乡共有六个农业社，它们都是一般的社，并不是最先进的。出城不久我们就来到这个掩映在一片绿竹丛中的村庄，乡党委书记看上去只有三十多岁，黧黑的面孔、粗壮的体格和他那真挚、朴素的谈吐，不用问就可以知道他出身农民。他告诉我们，张村乡共有八百八十五户，目前参加农业社的已占总农户的53.5％，其中张村85％的农户参加了农业社。由于今年改进了耕作方法，晚稻产量平均每公顷可达三十一公担，比去年增产一倍多，因而基本上解决了全乡的粮食问题。他兴奋地说，现在省里已经决定把他们的乡作为示范乡，并送给了他们一辆拖拉机。瞻望远景，他说全乡人民充满了无限信心，在敬爱的胡主席和劳动党的领导下，明年一定会获得更大的丰收。
    提到这个乡的过去，却有着一段悲惨的历史。解放前，全乡八百四十五越亩土地，被地主、富农占去的就有七百三十越亩，90％的农民没有一寸土地。由于无法维生，许多农民被迫背井离乡到南越去找生计，直到现在还有一百多人流浪在南越。1945年大饥荒的时候，在这片富饶的土地上，全乡就饿死了五百多人，特别是张村，竟饿死了一百五十多人。
    曾经遭受过深重苦难的这个乡的人民，对于今天的新生活和劳动党，表现了由衷的热爱和感激。同我们谈过话的一位乡干部陈文罕同志，他的经历可以充分地说明这一点。陈文罕今年三十二岁，解放前家里无地无房，1945年的大饥荒中父母兄弟姐妹统统饿死，只有他一个人幸免于难。解放后，他分了土地，今年1月又新盖了一栋草房，参加农业社后收入年年增加。今年他家分得早稻二百八十公斤，晚稻八百七十公斤，比去年几乎增加50％。他说：“今天我们能过着这样好日子，永远也忘不了党！”这也正是张村乡的合作化发展得最快的原因。一个农民编的一首歌谣唱得好：“手拿黄金也不牢靠，参加农业社得温饱！”
    当我们在田里同收割的农民告别的时候，太阳已经偏西了。晚霞烧红了半边天，稻田里的水闪着灿烂的金光，远处近处仍然可以看到收割的人群，听到砰砰的打稻声。（附图片）
