(Reported by this newspaper) The Hezhe people, residing along the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers, are one of China's smallest ethnic groups. This ethnic group, which was on the verge of extinction before liberation, now enjoys happy labor and a fulfilling life in the great family of the motherland.
    According to statistics from around 1911, there were 2,500 to 3,000 Hezhe people in Heilongjiang Province. Due to the reactionary rule's national oppression and brutal exploitation, only about 300 Hezhe people remained by the eve of liberation. In the fourteen years since liberation, the Hezhe population has doubled.
    Now the Hezhe people enjoy equal political status with other fraternal ethnic groups. In Xiabacha, Fuyuan County, where many Hezhe people live, an ethnic township has been established. Among the six hundred-plus Hezhe people, there are nineteen township people's representatives, five county people's representatives, eight county or township government committee members, one provincial CPPCC member, and one county CPPCC member.
    The production and economic life of the Hezhe people have greatly developed since liberation. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, many Hezhe people were driven to live in swampy areas. After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government immediately helped them return to their homeland to rebuild their homes, and provided them with guns, ammunition, grain, and clothing for hunting. With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, they were attracted to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations and later in people's communes on a voluntary basis, helping them not only to engage in fishing and hunting but also to develop agricultural production. Over the years, the government has issued a large number of production loans to the Hezhe people. Now the Hezhe people have an average of one set of bedding and more than three sets of clothes per person. From 1954 to 1958, the Hezhe people built more than one hundred new houses, and some even bought sewing machines and gramophones. The Hezhe people's current food includes rice, flour, meat, and vegetables, whereas previously, even in the best of times, they only had some unsalted dried meat, wild vegetables, and millet soup, and wore fish skin and animal skin clothing.
    In Xiabacha and Jinjiekou in Fuyuan County, there are Hezhe ethnic primary schools or ethnic joint primary schools. The local Party and government organs pay close attention to absorbing Hezhe people to study in various schools. The Party School, cultural cadre school, middle school, normal school, and ethnic cadre training class in Raohe County all have Hezhe people studying. Among this very small ethnic group, the Party and the state have cultivated one professor, one assistant professor, one film director, one hospital president, and one physician.

    赫哲族生产生活蒸蒸日上
    人口增加一倍物质和文化生活大改善
    本报讯　居住在黑龙江和乌苏里江边的赫哲族，是我国人口最少的民族之一。这个解放前几乎灭绝的民族，现在在祖国的大家庭里劳动愉快，生活幸福。
    据1911年前后的统计，黑龙江省内的赫哲族共有二千五百人到三千人。由于反动统治的民族压迫和残酷剥削，到解放前夕，赫哲族只剩下三百来人了。解放后的十四年中，赫哲族的人口增加了一倍。
    现在赫哲族和其他兄弟民族享有同等的政治地位。抚远县下八岔赫哲族聚居较多的地方成立了民族乡。六百多人的赫哲族中有十九名乡人民代表，五名县人民代表，八名县或乡的政府委员，一名省政协委员，一名县政协委员。
    赫哲族人民的生产和经济生活在解放后大大地发展了。敌伪统治时期，不少赫哲人曾被赶到沼泽地区居住。解放后，共产党和人民政府立即帮助他们迁回故里重建家园，发给他们狩猎用的枪枝弹药和粮食衣服。随着互助合作运动的发展，在自愿的原则下，吸引他们参加互助合作组织和以后的人民公社，帮助他们不仅从事渔猎，同时发展农业生产。几年间，政府在赫哲族中发放了大量的生产贷款。现在赫哲族平均每人有一套被褥、三套以上的衣服。从1954年到1958年，赫哲族盖了一百多间新房屋，有的还购买了缝纫机、留声机。赫哲人现在的食品有米、面、肉、蔬菜，而以前最好的生活，也只是一些无盐的肉干、野菜、小米汤，穿的则是鱼皮和兽皮。
    在抚远县的下八岔、津街口，都有赫哲人的民族小学或民族联合小学。当地的党、政机关都非常注意吸收赫哲人在各种学校里学习。饶河县的党校、文化干部学校、中学、师范、民族干部训练班，都有赫哲人学习。在这个人口虽然极少的民族中，党和国家已经培养出教授、助教、电影导演、医院院长、医师各一人。
