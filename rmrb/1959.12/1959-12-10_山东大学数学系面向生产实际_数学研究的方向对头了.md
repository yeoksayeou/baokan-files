Shandong University Mathematics Department Faces Production Reality
    Mathematical Research is Headed in the Right Direction

    (Our dispatch) Jinan - After criticizing the bourgeois method of mathematics research going from books to books and from theory to theory, the Mathematics Department of Shandong University closely integrated mathematical research with practical application, served production diligently, greatly enriched research content, improved teaching quality, and promoted the development of the mathematics department. Teachers and students happily said that from now on, the goal of the Mathematics Department in cultivating talents is clearer, and the direction of mathematical research is correct.

    In the past, the teachers and students of this department were deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology, believing that "mathematics is different from other disciplines and cannot be linked to production practice; it can only engage in pure theoretical research." Therefore, most teachers and students neglected politics, going from literature to literature, for science for the sake of science, and the atmosphere of detachment from reality was very strong. Scientific research in other departments was booming because they took the road of linking with reality and serving production, but they were cold and quiet. The general Party branch of the Mathematics Department organized all teachers and students to deeply expose and criticize this bourgeois ideology, refuted the fallacy that "mathematical research cannot be linked to reality and cannot serve production," and adopted many measures to thoroughly implement the Party's education policy. They once organized some teachers and students to participate in the trial production of general-purpose digital electronic computers with the Mathematics Research Institute of the Shandong Provincial Academy of Sciences and other units, and another group of teachers and students made analog electronic computers themselves. More importantly, at the end of last year and in April this year, they organized teachers and students on two large scales to go deep into factories and mines to discover and solve mathematical problems in production practice, and accepted and solved some major problems raised by various production units. In this way, the scientific research work of the Mathematics Department was directly oriented towards production, towards reality, and closely integrated with socialist construction. The Jinan Railway Administration encountered great difficulties in mathematical calculations that affected construction, and the teachers and students of this department calculated the required results for them, greatly advancing the construction date. The Jinan Power Plant organized manpower many times to calculate the thermal and strength of a turbine, but failed to complete it. The Mathematics Department sent a working group, which, after two months of repeated calculations, finally provided theoretical data for improving the output of the turbine. From October 1958 to the present, for more than a year, the teachers and students of this department have solved more than 200 mathematical problems in factories and mines, and written 354 papers and reports, exceeding 66.2% of the papers written since liberation; by helping transportation departments and material allocation units formulate linear programming and organize rational transportation, it is estimated that more than 24 million yuan can be saved for the state.

    In the process of solving practical production problems, the teachers and students of this department adopted the method of "sticking to the end," that is, going deep into the production site, discovering problems, raising them to theory to be solved, and then returning to guide production practice. Through these efforts, all teachers and students have become more clearly aware that mathematics is a powerful tool for production and construction and other disciplines, and that mathematical research must serve production practice and is also capable of serving production practice.

    With more and more cutting-edge or major problems in production, more and higher demands have also been placed on mathematicians. At present, various factories and mining enterprises have raised many major problems that require the Mathematics Department to assist in solving, such as mathematical calculation problems in the Weishan Reservoir project, the theory of blasting, etc. In this way, mathematical scientific research can not only serve production and construction more and better, but also production and construction have opened up a broad field for mathematical research.

    In scientific research related to production practice, this department has obtained a large number of materials, which have been sorted, analyzed, researched, and applied to teaching, greatly enriching the teaching content. For example, in the course of operations research, there are already a large number of linear programming materials related to transportation throughout the province; in the course of differential geometry, some valuable materials collected during the work in factories have also been applied. On the basis of the widespread development of scientific research and the significant achievements already made, this department has newly established "calculation specialization," and opened five new courses closely related to production practice, such as approximate methods, probability theory, operations research, computer principles, and program design, and has already trained a group of graduates specializing in calculation for the country.

    Students who participate in scientific research also directly gain a lot of knowledge that cannot be obtained from books. In the process of trial-producing analog electronic computers, students are equivalent to learning a course in computing technology. Current students have learned more courses than previous graduates, such as approximate methods, probability theory, and operations research. Students' ability to think and work independently has also been significantly improved. For example, the problem of humidity control, which has long existed in Jinan State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1, was repeatedly explored and studied by a third-year student, who came up with a formula that enabled the yarn factory to scientifically control the humidity of the workshop, providing a reliable scientific basis for cotton yarn quality control.

    山东大学数学系面向生产实际
    数学研究的方向对头了
    本报讯　山东大学数学系批判了数学研究从书本到书本、从理论到理论的资产阶级方法以后，数学研究密切联系实际，紧紧为生产服务，大大丰富了研究内容，并且提高了教学质量，促进了数学系的发展。师生们满心欢喜地说，从此数学系培养人材的目标更加明确了，数学研究的方向对头了。
    这个系的师生，过去受资产阶级思想影响比较深，认为“数学与其它学科不同，没法联系生产实际，只能搞些纯理论性的研究”。因而，多数师生忽视政治，从文献到文献，为科学而科学，脱离实际的风气非常浓厚。其它系的科学研究由于走了联系实际、为生产服务的路，轰轰烈烈，他们却冷冷清清。数学系党总支组织全系师生对这种资产阶级思想进行了深刻的揭发和批判，驳倒了“数学研究不能联系实际、不能为生产服务”的谬论，采取许多措施，深入贯彻党的教育方针。他们曾经组织一部分师生参加山东省科学分院数学研究所等单位关于通用数字电子计算机的试制工作，另一部分师生自己动手试制模拟电子计算机。而更重要的是于去年年底和今年4月，先后两次大规模地组织师生深入到厂矿中去发掘和解决生产实践中的数学问题，并接纳解决各生产单位提出的一些重大问题。这样，就使数学系的科学研究工作直接面向生产，面向实际，与社会主义建设密切结合起来。济南铁路管理局曾经因为数学计算上遇到很大困难而影响施工，这个系的师生为他们算出所需结果，大大提前了施工日期。济南发电厂对一部汽轮机进行关于热力与强度的计算，多次组织人力，都没有完成。数学系派去一个工作小组，经过两个月，反复计算多次，终于对汽轮机提高出力问题，提供了理论数据。从1958年10月到现在一年多来，这个系的师生下厂下矿解决了二百多个数学问题，写出论文和报告三百五十四篇，超过解放以来所写论文的66.2％；通过帮助运输部门和物资调拨单位制订线性规划，组织合理运输，约计可以为国家节省资金二千四百多万元。
    在解决生产实际问题的过程中，这个系的师生采取了“一杆子插到底”的方法，即深入生产现场，发掘出问题，提高到理论加以解决，再返回去指导生产实际。通过这些工作，全系师生更加明确认识到，数学这个学科是为生产建设和其它学科服务的有力工具，数学研究必须为生产实际服务、也是能够为生产实际服务的。
    随着生产中的尖端问题或重大问题愈来愈多，对数学工作者也提出了更多更高的要求。现在各厂矿企业单位提出了许多要数学系协助解决的重大问题，如位山水库工程中的数学计算问题、爆破理论等。这样一来，数学科学研究不仅能够更多更好地为生产建设服务，而且生产建设也为数学研究开辟了广阔的园地。
    这个系在联系生产实际的科学研究中，获得了大批材料，经整理、分析、研究，运用到教学中去，大大丰富了教学内容。如在运筹学这门课程中，已经有了联系全省交通运输的大量的线性规划材料；在微分几何这一课程中，也应用了一些下厂时收集到的宝贵材料。在科学研究广泛开展并已经获得显著成绩的基础上，这个系新建立了“计算专门化”，开出了密切联系生产实践的近似方法、概率论、运筹学、计算机原理、程序设计等五门新课程，并且已经为国家培养出了一批计算专门化的毕业生。
    学生们参加科学研究，也直接得到了许多书本上得不到的知识。在试制模拟电子计算机过程中，学生就相当于学了一门计算技术课程。现有学生比历届毕业生多学了近似方法、概率论、运筹学等门课程。学生独立思考和工作的能力也有显著提高。如济南国棉一厂过去长期存在的回潮率控制问题，经三年级一个学生多次探讨研究，得出一个公式，使纱厂能够科学地控制车间回潮率，为棉纱质量控制提供了可靠的科学根据。　　（王建林）
