Zhao Changqing Creates Combined Loading, Unloading, and Log-Turning Vehicle Machine
    Relieving the Heavy Labor of Forestry Workers

    Zhao Changqing, an old loading worker from the Xiniqi Forestry Bureau of the Greater Khingan Mountains in Inner Mongolia, created a combined loading, unloading, and log-turning vehicle machine during a technical innovation.

    This machine is similar to a winch. Its structure is relatively simple, using an old automobile engine to drive four drums. It is equivalent to the function of two domestically produced double-drum winches. Its characteristic is that it can simultaneously carry out work such as loading trains and unloading automobiles. Using this machine to load a train car of timber takes only forty minutes, manpower can be reduced by half compared to the original, and efficiency can be increased five times. Using this machine to unload automobiles can also increase efficiency by two times.

    In the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area, the heaviest physical labor is manually carrying timber to load trains. In order to relieve this heavy labor and improve loading efficiency, old loader Zhao Changqing started creating a loading machine in 1956, and after three unsuccessful attempts. But he still persevered and studied day and night, asking technical personnel for advice on things he didn't understand, or visiting other places to learn. After more than ten months of research, he finally successfully created this machine.

    赵长青制成联合装车卸车倒楞车机
    解除了林区工人的重劳动
    内蒙古大兴安岭西尼气林业局老装车工人赵长青，在技术革新中创造一台联合装车、卸车、倒楞车机。
    这种机器类似绞盘机。它的构造比较简单，用一台旧汽车发动机带动四个卷筒。它相当于两台国产双卷筒绞盘机的作用。它的特点是可以同时进行装火车和卸汽车等工作。运用这种机器装一火车皮木材只要四十分钟，人力可比原来减少一半，而效率可提高五倍。用这种机器来卸汽车，效率也可提高两倍。
    在大兴安岭林区最重的体力劳动就是人抬木材装火车。为了解脱这种繁重劳动和提高装车效率，老装车工赵长青从1956年就动手创造装车机，经过三次试验未成功。但他仍然百折不挠地日夜钻研，不懂的地方就向技术人员请教，或到外地参观学习。经过十个多月的钻研，终于创造成功这台机器。
