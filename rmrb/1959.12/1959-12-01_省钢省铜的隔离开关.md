    Isolation Switch That Saves Steel and Copper
    The Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory has trial-produced a new type of 35 kV and 60 kV high-voltage isolation switch.
    Compared with the old type, this new product has a volume reduced by one-third, saving about 50 kilograms of metal materials such as steel and copper, and also saving a large number of porcelain bottles. Taking the 60 kV high-voltage isolation switch as an example, each old product requires 18 porcelain bottles, while the new one only requires 6. This item alone can save more than 300 yuan.

    省钢省铜的隔离开关
    沈阳高压开关厂试制出新型的三十五千伏、六十千伏高压隔离开关。
    这种新型产品比旧型产品体积缩小三分之一，节约钢、铜等金属材料约五十公斤，还可节省大量瓷瓶。以六十千伏高压隔离开关为例，每项旧型产品要用瓷瓶十八个，而新型的却只用六个，仅此一项就可节约三百多元。
