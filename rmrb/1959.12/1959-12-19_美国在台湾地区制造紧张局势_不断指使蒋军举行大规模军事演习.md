Xinhua News Agency, December 18th dispatch from Taipei: In order to create tensions in the Taiwan region, the United States has recently been directing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to conduct large-scale military exercises continuously.

On December 10th, Chiang's army's ground forces conducted a joint land-air search and combat exercise in southern Taiwan. The exercise included airdrops, aerial command issuance, intelligence transmission, search guidance, reconnaissance of positions, and handling of various combat situations. The Chiang army authorities boasted that this was the "first demonstration search and combat exercise using new equipment and light aircraft after the United States modernized Chiang's army's ground forces." When the exercise was conducted, a group of officials from the U.S. military assistance advisory group in Taiwan were present to supervise.

Chiang's army also recently conducted a so-called "unannounced mobilization exercise," and coerced retired Chiang army officers and soldiers who had been demobilized and transferred to participate. A large number of retired Chiang army officers and soldiers were concentrated at railway stations in Taichung, Changhua, and other places on December 12th, and then collectively escorted by Chiang army officers to Chiang army barracks in Songshan, Shilin, Xindian, and other places in Taipei to report for participation in the exercise.

The United States has also recently built a shell-loading plant for the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The construction of the plant was undertaken by the Sperry Rand Corporation, whose chairman is MacArthur, the former commander-in-chief of the U.S. Far East Command and war-monger.

    美国在台湾地区制造紧张局势
    不断指使蒋军举行大规模军事演习
    据新华社18日讯　台北消息：为了在台湾地区制造紧张局势，美国最近指使蒋介石集团连续举行大规模的军事演习。
    蒋军陆军部队本月10日在台湾南部举行陆空联合搜索作战演习。演习项目包括空投、空中命令下达、情报传递、搜索指导、阵地侦察和各种作战情况的处置等。蒋军当局吹嘘这是美国把蒋军陆军部队加以“现代化改制后，利用新式装备，配合轻型航空机所作的首次示范性搜索作战演习”。当演习时，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团的一批官员到场监督。
    蒋军最近还举行了一项所谓“不预告动员演习”，并且胁迫已经复员和转业的蒋军退役官兵参加。大批蒋军退役官兵在本月12日集中在台中、彰化等地的火车站，然后由蒋军军官把他们集体解送到台北松山、士林、新店等地的蒋军兵营报到，参加演习。
    美国最近还替蒋介石集团建成一个炮弹装药厂。建厂的工作由前远东美军总司令、战争贩子麦克阿瑟任董事长的斯佩里·兰德公司负责进行。
