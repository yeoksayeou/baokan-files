    Saigon News - According to the Saigon "Vietnam Times" on November 13th, "In the first eight months of 1959, the United States ranked first among suppliers to Vietnam for the first time due to the sale of 35 million US dollars worth of goods." The newspaper said that Japan ranked second with sales of 28 million US dollars worth of goods, and France ranked third with sales of 27 million US dollars worth of goods. The French weekly "International Forum," published on November 20, stated that because Ngo Dinh Diem and his advisors pursue a policy of excluding French influence in favor of American interests, French business owners either have to sell their industries at low prices to Ngo Dinh Diem's privileged cronies or compradors of American companies, or they have to agree to let "Vietnamese" funds invest, which is currently the counterpart fund of US "aid."

    美国资本在南越排挤法国资本
    西贡消息　据西贡“越南时报”11月13日报道，“在1959年的头八个月中，美国第一次由于销售三千五百万美元的货物而在越南的供应国中居首位。”报纸说，日本以出售二千八百万美元的货物而居第二位，法国以出售二千七百万美元的货物而居第三位。11月20日出版的法国“国际论坛”周刊说，由于吴庭艳及其顾问们奉行排斥法国的势力以利于美国的利益的政策，使法国企业主们要么把产业低价出让给享有特权的吴庭艳的亲信们或美国公司的买办们，要么只好同意让“越南”资金入股，而这项资金在目前就是美“援”的对等基金。
