Another "Cold War" Tactic by the United States
By Our Staff Commentator

In the election for non-permanent members of the Security Council at the current UN General Assembly, the election for a seat that should belong to an Eastern European country has not yielded a result after forty-nine ballots due to obstruction by the United States. The United States is attempting to forcibly have Turkey, which is fundamentally not an Eastern European country, once again occupy the seat of an Eastern European country, in order to prevent Poland, the candidate country nominated through consultation by Eastern European countries, from being elected. This blatant U.S. exclusion of the socialist country Poland from the Security Council is an extremely vile "Cold War" tactic.

According to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council bears the "primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security"; and in order for this body to be able to smoothly fulfill its responsibilities, the United Nations Charter also stipulates that its composition must "give due regard to equitable geographical distribution." In 1946, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France also reached a "Gentleman's Agreement" in London, deciding that the distribution of the six non-permanent members of the Security Council should be: Latin America two, Near and Middle East one, British Commonwealth one, and Western and Eastern Europe one each. However, in the past few re-elections, the United States has repeatedly violated this "Gentleman's Agreement." Since 1951, in the three re-elections of non-permanent members that should belong to Eastern European countries, the United States has successively dragged Greece, Turkey, and Japan, which fundamentally have no right to represent Eastern European countries, into the Security Council. The United States has each time trotted out stale arguments to defend itself, saying that "the 1946 agreement was only valid for the elections of that year." But in past re-elections of non-permanent members from regions other than Eastern Europe, the principles of the agreement have always been followed. On November 12, the plenary session of the current UN General Assembly elected Ecuador and Ceylon to replace Panama and Canada, whose terms had expired. Why hasn't this principle become invalid when applied to other regions, but it has become invalid when applied to countries in the Eastern European region? What other explanation is there besides the fact that U.S. imperialism is deliberately excluding Eastern European socialist countries?

Those who insist that the London Agreement is invalid are now putting forward the so-called "compromise" proposal of having Poland and Turkey share the two-year term of a non-permanent member. Doesn't this prove that it is difficult for them to completely destroy the London Agreement? However, this attempt to use the roundabout tactic of "compromise" to undermine the London Agreement and exclude socialist countries should also be condemned and opposed.

Recently, in the face of the exhaustion of its arguments, the U.S. representative even resorted to shameless slander against Poland, saying that the Polish delegation was acting under some kind of pressure and that Poland should be held responsible for the failure to reach a result in the election. The Polish delegation has issued a statement in response, sternly refuting the slander by the U.S. representative.

The Soviet Union, in line with its consistent spirit of upholding the United Nations Charter and the London Agreement, has demanded that the General Assembly elect Poland as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. In its statement on October 6, the Soviet delegation pointed out that Poland is the candidate country nominated by Eastern European countries and should have a seat on the Security Council. The fact that the Polish people fought heroically against fascism is another powerful argument for electing Poland to the Security Council. Poland's peaceful policy in modern international relations is also well known to everyone. The Soviet delegation solemnly condemned the actions obstructing Poland's election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. It is clear that the U.S. insistence on violating the agreement and excluding Poland can only show that it is using the issue of seats on the UN Security Council as a despicable tactic to antagonize socialist countries and continue to escalate the "Cold War."

    美国又一“冷战”手法
    本报评论员
    在本届联大进行的安全理事会非常任理事国的选举中，一个应属于东欧国家的席位的选举，由于美国的阻挠，经过四十九次投票还未得出结果。美国企图强行把根本不是东欧国家的土耳其再次霸占东欧国家的席位，以阻止由东欧国家协商提出的候选国波兰当选。美国这样露骨地排斥社会主义国家波兰进入安理会，是一种极端恶劣的“冷战”手法。
    根据联合国宪章的规定，安理会负有“维持国际和平及安全之主要责任”；而为了使这个机构能够顺利地履行它的职责，联合国宪章还规定，它的组成必须“充分斟酌地域上之公匀分配”。苏、美、英、法等国1946年又曾在伦敦达成了一项“君子协定”，决定安理会六个非常任理事国席位的分配，应当是：拉丁美洲二，中近东一，英联邦一，西欧和东欧各一。但是，在过去几次改选中，美国一再破坏了这个“君子协定”。1951年以来，三次改选应属东欧国家的非常任理事国时，美国都曾先后把根本没有权利代表东欧国家的希腊、土耳其、日本拉进了安理会。美国每一次都搬出陈腐的论据来替自己辩护，说什么“1946年协定只对那一年的选举有效。”但过去历届改选东欧以外其余地区的非常任理事国时，都是按协定的原则确定的。本届联大全体会议11月12日就曾选出厄瓜多尔和锡兰，接替任期届满的巴拿马和加拿大。为什么这样的原则用于其他地区时并未失效，而用于东欧地区的国家时却失效了呢？这除了说明美帝国主义蓄意排斥东欧社会主义国家之外，还能有什么别的解释呢？
    那些硬说伦敦协议失效的国家，现在却又提出所谓“折衷”主张，即把非常任理事国的两年任期由波兰和土耳其分享，这不是证明他们要完全破坏伦敦协议是困难的吗？但是，这种想用“折衷”的迂回战术，破坏伦敦协议，排斥社会主义国家的主张，同样也是应该受到谴责和反对的。
    最近美国代表在理屈词穷之余，竟对波兰进行无耻诽谤，说什么波兰代表团是在某种压力下行事的，选举得不到结果应由波兰负责。波兰代表团已对此发表声明，严词驳斥了美国代表的诽谤。
    苏联本着一贯维护联合国宪章和伦敦协定的精神，要求大会选举波兰为安全理事会非常任理事国。苏联代表团10月6日的声明中指出：波兰是东欧国家提出的候选国，本应在安全理事会占有席位。波兰人民曾英勇地进行过反法西斯的斗争，这个事实是把波兰选入安全理事会的又一个有力的论据。波兰在现代国际关系中的和平政策也是大家都清楚地知道的。苏联代表团严正地谴责了阻挠波兰当选安理会非常任理事国的行为。很显然，美国坚持违背协定、排斥波兰的行为，只能说明它把联合国安理会的席位问题，也作为敌视社会主义国家和继续加剧“冷战”的一个卑鄙手法。
