A Visit to the Kitchen Machinery
By our reporter Xu Zhongren

The Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory has recently issued more than a thousand blueprints for kitchen machinery, but the number of visitors continues unabated.

In a rectangular room, various cooking utensils are neatly displayed.

Next to the dough mixer, a cook puts two bags of dry flour into a fan-shaped box machine, adds water, and starts the motor. The mixer inside the iron box immediately starts to rotate rapidly. After two or three minutes, the cook opens the machine, and inside is a very evenly mixed wet dough. He smiled and said to us, "In the past, it took two people more than half an hour, sweating all over, to mix it evenly!" This time, the dough is for steaming buns. If it is for making noodles, it takes an average of only forty seconds to mix a bag.

South of the dough mixer, under a cylindrical tower-shaped rice washing machine, the washed rice grains are flowing down the trapezoidal flume with a rustling sound. People can see that the electric rice feeding pipe sucks the rice from the bucket into the tower, which is slightly taller than a person, and the spiral blades in the tower are constantly rotated by the water. Two hundred pounds of rice can be washed in five minutes, and the bran and sand are all separated.

At the other end of the room, a simple structure of the vegetable cutting machine exerts a powerful force. In a few seconds, it cuts six or seven pounds of cabbage into snow-like flakes that fall into a large dustpan. It can cut two thousand pounds of cabbage in half an hour, which is 160 times more efficient than manual cutting. This kind of vegetable cutting machine can cut both shreds and slices.

Next to the vegetable cutting machine, the cook is putting the pork produced by his sideline production into the meat cutting machine. As soon as the half-horsepower motor starts, the many serrated round iron slices of the meat cutting machine start to rotate rapidly. According to the cook's wishes, within fifteen minutes, fifty pounds of meat is cut into diced meat, shredded meat, and sliced meat according to people's wishes.

This cafeteria, which serves six thousand people, has a heavy workload for washing dishes. In the past, it took twelve people four hours to wash the dishes used for one meal. Now, with a dishwasher, the situation is very different. There is a cook at each end of the machine. One cook places the dirty bowl diagonally in a drawer-like wooden bucket and pushes it into the chest of the machine; when the iron wheel transmits it to the other end of the machine, what people see is a disinfected clean bowl. In two hours, the two cooks wash all the tens of thousands of dishes. This dishwasher, which is more than five meters long, has hot steam underneath. After heating, the water is heated to more than eighty degrees. The dirty bowls are rinsed by the hot water sprayed up and down, and even the thickest grease cannot stay.

In this kitchen utensils room, there are also filling squeezing machines, cake cutting machines, flour sack sweeping machines, corn flour pressing machines, vegetable washing machines, as well as steaming boxes and ovens. All these machines were made by the workers and cooks of this factory in cooperation, and they only cost more than a thousand yuan in total. The power consumption is also not much, about ten degrees per day. The saved cooks account for more than two-fifths of the original number, a total of sixty-four people. Now, they have all participated in industrial and agricultural production and other work. (Attached pictures)

### 炊事机械参观记

    炊事机械参观记
    本报记者　徐仲人
    北京第一机床厂食堂最近已经发出了一千多份炊事机械的图纸，可是参观的人还是络绎不绝。
    在一间长方形的屋里，井然有序地陈列着各种炊事用具。
    在和面机旁，炊事员把两袋干面放进像扇形盒子的机器里，配上了水，开动马达，铁盒内的搅拌机立即飞快地转动起来。过了两三分钟，炊事员把机器一打开，里面已是和得非常匀称的湿面了。他笑着对我们说：“过去要两个人，用半个多小时，出一身大汗，才能把它和匀哩！”这次和的是蒸馒头的面，要是和做面条的面，平均只要四十秒钟，就可以和一袋。
    在和面机南边，圆柱塔形淘米机下，洗净的米粒正沿着梯形水槽沙沙地流下来。人们看到，电动的上米铁管把米从桶里吸向比人稍高的塔中，塔里的螺旋叶就被水冲得不停地转动起来。五分钟就洗好了二百斤大米，糠秕和砂子通统被分离了出来。
    在屋子的另一端，结构简单的切菜机发挥着强大的威力。它几秒钟就把六、七斤重的白菜切得雪片似地纷纷落在大簸箩里，半个小时可以切两千斤白菜，比手工切菜提高效率一百六十倍。这种切菜机既能切丝又能切片。
    在切菜机旁边，炊事员正把自己搞副业生产的猪肉放到切肉机上去，半马力的马达一响，切肉机的许多锯齿圆铁片便呼呼地转动起来。按照炊事员的意愿，在十五分钟内，五十斤肉就随着人的心愿被分别切成肉丁、肉丝和肉片了。
    这个六千人用餐的食堂，洗碗工作很繁重，以前一顿饭用的碗碟，十二个人洗四个小时还洗不完。现在有了洗碗机，情况就大不同了。机器的两头各有一位炊事员，一位炊事员把脏碗斜放在像抽屉一样的木斗里，推进机器的胸膛；当铁轮把它传送到机器的另一头时，人们看到的已是消毒过的干净碗了。在两小时内，这两位炊事员就把上万只碗碟全部洗好。这台五米多长的洗碗机，下面是热蒸汽，加温后，水被烧到八十多度，脏碗经过上下喷出的热水的冲涮，再厚的油腻也留不住了。
    在这个炊事用具室里，还有挤馅机、切饼机、扫面袋机，压玉米面机、洗菜机，还有蒸箱和烤炉。所有这些机器，都是这个厂的工人和炊事员们合作制成的，一共只花费了一千多元。耗电也不多，每天大约十多度。节省出来的炊事员，却占原来人数的五分之二以上，共有六十四人。现在，他们都已分别参加了工农业生产和其他工作。（附图片）
