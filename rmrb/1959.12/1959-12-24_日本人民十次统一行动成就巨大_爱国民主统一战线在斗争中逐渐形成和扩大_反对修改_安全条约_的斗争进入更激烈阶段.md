Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: This reporter reports: Since April 15th this year, the Japanese people's national unified actions to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke government from revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" have been carried out vigorously ten times. The Japanese people have written a brilliant page in the epic of the struggle against the conclusion of a military alliance between Japan and the United States and for Japan's independence, peace, and neutrality, using the unique form of "unified action."

Fostering the revival of Japanese militarism and concluding a Japan-U.S. military alliance are important arrangements in the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression in Asia. Especially in the situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, the national independence movements in Asia and Africa are rising, and the U.S. "position of strength" policy has gone bankrupt, the United States attaches more importance to Japan as its base for conducting nuclear war and to Japan's role as its "gendarme" in Asia. On the other hand, the Kishi Nobusuke government, which is plotting to relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," attempts to rely on the support of its U.S. masters to rapidly revive militarism, carry out economic expansion into Southeast Asia, and openly embark on the old road of imperialism. Therefore, both the U.S. and Japan want to use each other to conclude a military alliance to achieve their respective aggressive goals. Since last autumn, the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke government have been actively engaged in revising the "Security Treaty" and planned to sign it in February this year. However, this step of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries was disrupted by the Japanese people's struggle. The unified actions, which were more and more powerful each time, have postponed the date of the signing of the new "Security Treaty" by the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke government for a year, and exposed the aggressive nature of this new treaty to the people of the world, arousing widespread opposition. This shows that the Japanese people's rising struggle has achieved great victory, which is a major contribution made by the Japanese people to the cause of peace in Asia.

The Japanese people's patriotic democratic united front has gradually formed and expanded in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty." Since the establishment of the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" jointly formed by the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan in March this year, this mass movement has become more leadership-oriented and organized, and has rapidly moved towards a climax. On April 15th this year, hundreds of thousands of people across Japan participated in the first national unified action; at present, the Japanese people's unified action against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has developed into a movement that shakes Japan, with more than four million people simultaneously striking, gathering, demonstrating, marching, and petitioning across the country. According to Japanese newspapers, the number of people now united around the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has reached seven million, and the number of people opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty" in various forms has reached ten million.

In the past year of struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Japanese people have realized that the root causes of the threats to their peaceful lives, democratic rights, and the deterioration of living conditions lie in the U.S. military's occupation of Japan and the revival of Japanese militarism. Therefore, they closely integrated the struggle to support the innocent defendants of the "Sunagawa Incident" and the "Matsukawa Incident," the workers' opposition to unemployment and dismissal, the farmers' opposition to heavy taxes and demands for higher rice purchase prices, and the women's struggle to defend their families and children with the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," and have continuously achieved victories in these struggles.

In the past year, the Kishi Nobusuke group, while implementing a war policy of following the United States, has adopted an increasingly blatant hostile policy towards China.

Japanese public opinion points out that once a new "Security Treaty" is concluded with China as an enemy country, it will increase the obstacles to improving Japan-China relations. In response to this situation, the Japanese people have strengthened the movement to demand the improvement of Japan-China relations in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty," making the slogan of Japan-China friendship more popular.

The Kishi Nobusuke group has announced that it will go to the United States in January next year to sign a new "Security Treaty" and attempt to forcibly pass this treaty in the Diet afterward. Under this circumstance, the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" will enter a more intense and important stage.

　　日本人民十次统一行动成就巨大
    爱国民主统一战线在斗争中逐渐形成和扩大
    反对修改“安全条约”的斗争进入更激烈阶段
    据新华社23日讯　本社记者报道：从今年4月15日以来，日本人民阻止岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的全国统一行动，已经轰轰烈烈地进行了十次。日本人民用“统一行动”这种独创的形式在反对日美缔结军事同盟、争取日本独立、和平和中立的斗争的史诗中写下了光辉的一页。
    扶植日本军国主义复活和缔结日美军事同盟，是美帝国主义者侵略亚洲政策中的重要布局。特别是在东风压倒西风、亚非民族独立运动日益高涨、美国的“实力地位”政策已经破产的情况下，美国更加重视日本作为它进行核战争的基地和使日本充当它在亚洲的“宪兵”的作用。另一方面，阴谋重温“大东亚共荣圈”旧梦的岸信介政府，企图依靠美国主子的撑腰，迅速复活军国主义，向东南亚进行经济扩张，公开走上帝国主义老路。因此，美日双方都想通过缔结军事同盟来彼此利用和达到侵略的目的。去年秋季以来，美国和岸信介政府就积极进行修改“安全条约”的活动，并且打算在今年2月签字。但是，美日反动派的这一步调被日本人民的斗争打乱，一次比一次声势浩大的统一行动，已经把美国和岸信介政府签订新的“安全条约”的日期推迟了一年，并且使这个新条约的侵略本质暴露在世界人民面前而引起普遍反对。这说明日本人民一浪高一浪的斗争已经取得很大胜利，这是日本人民对亚洲和平事业作出的重大贡献。
    日本人民的爱国民主统一战线在反对修改“安全条约”的斗争过程中逐渐形成和扩大。自从今年3月由日本社会党、共产党和日本工会总评议会联合组成的阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议成立以来，这一群众运动更加有领导和有组织了，并且迅速地走向高潮。今年4月15日，日本全国有几十万人参加第一次全国统一行动；目前，日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的统一行动已经发展成为一次就有四百多万人在全国各地同时罢工、集会、示威游行和请愿的震动日本的运动。据日本报刊报道，现在团结在阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议周围的人数已经达到七百万人，以各种形式来反对修改“安全条约”的人数已经达到一千万人。
    日本人民在一年来的反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争中，认识到他们的和平生活、民主权利的遭到威胁和生活条件的恶化，其根源在于美军对日本的占领和日本的复活军国主义。因此，他们把支援“砂川事件”和“松川事件”的无辜被告的斗争，把工人反对失业和解雇，农民反对重税和要求提高大米收购价格以及妇女保卫家庭和儿童的斗争，都同阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争紧密地结合起来，并且在这些斗争中不断取得胜利。
    一年来，岸信介集团在执行追随美国的战争政策的同时，对中国采取了日益露骨的敌视政策。
    日本舆论指出，一旦缔结以中国为敌国的新的“安全条约”，就将增加改善日中关系的阻力。针对这种情况，日本人民在反对修改“安全条约”的斗争中，加强了要求改善日中关系的运动，使日中友好的口号更加深入人心。
    岸信介集团已经宣布要在明年1月去美国签订新的“安全条约”，并且企图随后在国会上强行通过这项条约。在这种情况下，日本人民阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争将进入更加激烈和重要的阶段。
