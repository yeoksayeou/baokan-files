    Did You Know?
    In southern Africa, there is a bird called the "honeyguide," or "guide cuckoo."
    When it finds a wild beehive, the cuckoo first looks around for people and calls out to the first person it encounters. It leads the way in front of the person, going several hundred meters or a kilometer, then it looks back to see if the person is following.
    The cuckoo leads the person to the wild beehive and waits aside. Only after the person has scooped out the watery wild honey is it satisfied to eat the honey residue and wild bee larvae. Its bird skin is very thick and not afraid of wild bee stings at all. [Compiled by Jin Chun]

    你知道吗？
    非洲南部有一种鸟，叫做“蜂蜜指南”，或者叫“指南杜鹃”。
    当它找到野蜂巢时，杜鹃首先去四处找人，用叫声招呼它所遇见的第一个人。它在人前引路，走到几百米或者一公里，它回头看看人是不是跟在后面。
    杜鹃把人领到野蜂巢，自己在一旁等着。等人把多水分的野蜂蜜掏净，它才满意地吃蜂蜜残渣和野蜂幼虫。它的鸟皮非常厚，一点也不怕野蜂螫咬。　〔金纯编译〕
