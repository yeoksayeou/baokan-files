    Welcome Investigation Reports on People's Communes

    Recently, the People's Daily on pages three and seven has published some investigation reports on people's communes. These investigation reports, with concrete facts, vividly and convincingly illustrate that the emergence of people's communes is not accidental, but an inevitable product of China's political and economic development; it is a product of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line. Therefore, it has strong vitality and unparalleled superiority. The facts powerfully refute all the slanders of the right-leaning opportunists against the people's communes. The claims that people's communes were "stirred up by a few people," "established too early," or "badly managed" are complete nonsense. People's communes are very good, a hundred times good! We hope that newspapers will publish more articles like this.

    欢迎人民公社调查报告
    人民日报三版和七版近来发表了一些人民公社调查报告。这些调查报告，以具体事实，生动地令人信服地说明了人民公社的出现不是偶然的，而是我国政治、经济发展的必然产物；是在党的总路线光辉照耀下1958年大跃进的产物。因此，它有强大的生命力和无比的优越性。事实有力地回击了右倾机会主义分子对人民公社的一切诽谤。什么人民公社是“少数人轰起来的”，“办早了”、“办糟了”，这完全是一派胡说。人民公社好得很，一百个好得很！我们希望报纸多发表一些这样的文章。
