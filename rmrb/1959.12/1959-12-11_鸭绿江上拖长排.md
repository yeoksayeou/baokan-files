    Long Rafts Towed on the Yalu River
    The Yongdian Wooden Sailboat Transport Cooperative in Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, recently successfully test-sailed wooden boat towing rafts on the 180-kilometer route of the Yalu River from "Xiaolu River to Yongdian." Two wooden sailboats with a deadweight of 29 tons each towed 607 cubic meters of wood at a time, increasing transportation efficiency by 3.5 times compared to the past. The monthly output per ton of the boats reached 2,607 ton-kilometers, 1.6 times higher than the 1,000 ton-kilometer target per month per ton of boat proposed at the National Heroes Conference.
    Wooden boat towing rafts is an effective method to tap the potential of transportation equipment and expand transportation capacity. It can increase transportation efficiency several times over, opening up a new way to solve the shortage of transportation capacity.

    鸭绿江上拖长排
    辽宁省宽甸县永甸木帆船运输合作社最近在鸭绿江的“下露河至永甸”长达一百八十公里的航线上，试航木船拖排成功。两只载重二十九吨的木帆船一次拖运木材六百零七立方米，比过去提高运效三倍半，船吨月产达二千六百零七吨公里，比全国群英会上提出的船吨月产千吨公里指标提高一点六倍。
    木船拖排是挖掘运输设备潜力、扩大运输能力的一种有效方法，它可以几倍地提高运输效率，为解决运力不足开辟了一条新的途径。
