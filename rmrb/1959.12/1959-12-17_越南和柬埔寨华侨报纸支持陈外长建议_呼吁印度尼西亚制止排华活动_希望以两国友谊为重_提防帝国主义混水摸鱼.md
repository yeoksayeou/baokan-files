Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 16th: 河内“新越华报” (Hanoi's "New Vietnam-China News") published a commentary on the 14th, calling on the Indonesian authorities to prioritize the friendship between China and Indonesia, the solidarity of Asian and African countries, and the peace of Asia and the world. It urged them to immediately stop all anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia and promptly appoint representatives to negotiate with representatives of the Chinese government to comprehensively resolve the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia.

The commentary pointed out that the anti-Chinese activities taking place in Indonesia only benefit American imperialism. The commentary hoped that the Indonesian authorities would adopt a wise attitude, heighten their vigilance, and not allow American imperialism to exploit the overseas Chinese issue to muddy the waters and take the opportunity to realize its sinister and vicious conspiracies.

The commentary refuted the reactionary Indonesian forces' slanderous accusations that "the overseas Chinese economy is a colonialist economy" and that "overseas Chinese are the fifth column." The commentary pointed out that if Indonesia wants to develop its national economy, it should concentrate all its efforts on fighting the tiger lying next to it (referring to the foreign monopoly capital that controls Indonesia's economic lifeline). The commentary said that as for the overseas Chinese small merchants in Indonesia, they are playing a positive role in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in Indonesia to meet the needs of the local people.

The commentary said that as for the "fifth column" mentioned by the Indonesian reactionaries, it is not the overseas Chinese, but precisely the Indonesian reactionaries themselves – the agents of American imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: Phnom Penh report: Cambodian overseas Chinese newspaper "工商日报" (Industry and Commerce Daily) published an editorial on the 13th, expressing warm support for the proposal made by Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi in his letter to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio to comprehensively resolve the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. It also expressed hope that the Indonesian government, in accordance with the Bandung spirit, would prioritize the friendship between China and Indonesia and Asian-African solidarity, and take corresponding measures to reasonably resolve the overseas Chinese issue.

The newspaper said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's proposal is correct and reasonable. It represents the will of 650 million Chinese people. The newspaper said that now, the overseas Chinese are receiving the care and protection of their great motherland and are no longer "overseas orphans." The overseas Chinese will never tolerate persecution against them under any pretext.

The newspaper accused the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia of launching anti-Chinese activities. It said that this not only makes the Chinese people feel indignant, but also violates the will of the Indonesian people. The newspaper said that there are no fundamental contradictions between the people of the two countries. On the contrary, both countries have been subjected to imperialist aggression and interference. Therefore, only mutual support and strengthened cooperation between the two countries is in line with their common interests. The newspaper hoped that the Indonesian side would carefully consider this issue.

    越南和柬埔寨华侨报纸支持陈外长建议
    呼吁印度尼西亚制止排华活动
    希望以两国友谊为重  提防帝国主义混水摸鱼
    新华社河内16日电　河内“新越华报”在14日发表评论，呼吁印度尼西亚当局以中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的友谊为重，以亚非国家的团结为重，以亚洲和世界和平为重，立即制止在印度尼西亚发生的一切排华活动，早日指派代表同中国政府的代表进行协商，以全盘解决在印度尼西亚的华侨的问题。
    评论指出，在印度尼西亚发生的排华活动只有利于美帝国主义。评论希望印度尼西亚当局采取明智的态度，提高警惕，不让美帝国主义利用华侨问题来混水摸鱼，乘机实现它的不可告人的毒辣阴谋。
    评论驳斥了印度尼西亚反动势力诬蔑“华侨经济是殖民主义经济”、“华侨是第五纵队”的谬论。评论指出，印度尼西亚如果想发展它的民族经济，它应该集中全力去打躺在它身边的老虎（指控制印度尼西亚经济命脉的外国垄断资本）。评论说，至于在印度尼西亚的华侨小商贩，他们在促进印度尼西亚城乡之间的物资交流以满足当地人民需要方面是起着积极作用的。
    评论说，至于印度尼西亚反动派谈到的“第五纵队”，那不是华侨，而恰好是印度尼西亚的反动派——美帝国主义的代理人自己。
    据新华社16日讯　金边消息：柬埔寨华侨报纸“工商日报”在13日发表社论，表示热烈支持中国外交部长陈毅在他写给印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约的信中提出的全盘解决在印度尼西亚的华侨问题的建议，并且表示希望印度尼西亚政府根据万隆精神，以中国和印度尼西亚的友谊和亚非团结为重，采取相应的措施来合理解决华侨问题。
    这家报纸说，陈毅外交部长的建议是正确的、合理的。它代表了六亿五千万中国人民的意志。报纸说，现在，华侨得到伟大祖国的关怀和保护，不再是“海外孤儿”了。华侨决不容忍以任何借口对他们进行迫害。
    这家报纸指责印度尼西亚右翼反动势力发动排华活动。它说，这不仅使中国人民感到愤慨，而且违背了印度尼西亚人民的意愿。这家报纸说，两国人民之间没有带有根本性质的矛盾，相反，两国同样受到帝国主义者的侵略和干涉，因此，只有两国相互支持和加强合作，才符合它们的共同利益。这家报纸希望印度尼西亚方面慎重地考虑这个问题。
