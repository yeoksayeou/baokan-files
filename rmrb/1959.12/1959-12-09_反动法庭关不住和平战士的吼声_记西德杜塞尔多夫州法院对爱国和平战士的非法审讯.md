    Reactionary Courts Cannot Silence the Roar of Peace Fighters
    Recording the Illegal Trial of Patriotic Peace Fighters by the Dusseldorf State Court in West Germany
    Li Yue
    Solemn declarations, angry accusations, sharp exposures and condemnations—this has been the victorious struggle waged by West German peace fighters against the West German reactionary authorities in the courtroom of the Dusseldorf State Court for the past four weeks.

    Beginning on November 10th, the West German judicial authorities have been conducting an illegal trial of seven patriotic peace activists on the charge of "leaders of organizations that undermine the constitution and commit criminal offenses in secret." For four weeks, the heroic struggle of the peace fighters in the courtroom has increasingly placed the West German prosecution and judicial authorities in a passive and embarrassing position.

    Initially, the court, disregarding justice and humanity, forced Mrs. Monde, a 71-year-old female peace fighter, a member of the World Peace Council, and the first chairwoman of the West German Peace Committee, who was suffering from illness for many years, to stand trial while ill. However, under strong public opposition, the court finally had to agree to "temporarily suspend" her trial. Mrs. Monde issued a statement upon leaving the court, expressing her determination to resolutely fight against the unreasonable attacks on her work and character. In the courtroom, the audience watched with a mixture of respect and indignation as this brave old woman, almost paralyzed, was carried out of the court by her defense lawyers.

    In the seven hearings over the first three weeks, the speeches of the six peace fighters in the courtroom became a powerful indictment against the West German authorities.

    Eckert, a member of the World Peace Council and the second chairman of the West German Peace Committee, forcefully pointed out in court that the West German authorities, who are actively engaged in atomic armament, oppose the Stockholm Appeal and the declarations of the World Peace Council, which are supported by hundreds of millions of people. This proves the necessity and justice of the World Peace Movement and the activities of the West German Peace Committee. He declared: We are not afraid of this trial, and we will continue to oppose the Bonn government's war policy.

    Two Christian defendants, Diehl and Oberhof, also declared in court that their participation in the struggle to defend peace was driven by Christian moral concepts. They also expressed their support for the communists who are fighting for peace alongside them. Reverend Oberhof, in his fifties, resolutely stated in his speech that his past statement that "praying for peace is not enough; we must fight for peace" was correct. His impassioned speech won the approval of many. This made the prosecutor uneasy, and he repeatedly asked the judge to stop him from "giving speeches here in this form." However, the pastor ignored them and continued to proclaim the truth of peace in his forceful voice.

    Vollrat, who had participated in the war to defend the Spanish Republic, sharply criticized the West German secret police for persecuting peace fighters. Refuting the slander that the Peace Committee was "hired," he pointed out that the broad mass movement in West Germany is the foundation of the Peace Committee, and people support the activities of the West German Peace Committee through the struggle for peace. Vollrat exposed with irrefutable facts that the West German Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union and its affiliated organizations receive hundreds of millions of marks in funding annually from the industrial federation of big capitalists. His powerful exposure left the prosecutor, who was accustomed to slandering others as being "hired," speechless.

    The court's trial not only became a platform for peace fighters to proclaim justice but also became an occasion for them to condemn the Bonn government's fascist rule. Defendant Kompara denounced in court the Bonn government's "liberation of eastern territories" and the continued appointment of Oberlander, who had massacred many Poles, as a minister. The prosecutor, as if stabbed by something, stood up and threatened to record his words and file charges. However, Kompara said righteously that he was not afraid of such charges at all and that he could provide proof of his speech at any time.

    The defendants' solemn declarations and angry accusations aroused great sympathy and support in the audience. Mrs. Gupta, a representative of the Women's International Democratic Federation who attended the hearing, said in describing her impression that the defendants were so undoubtedly defending the cause of peace and that their speeches during the trial were a contribution to expanding and strengthening the world peace movement.

    When the trial entered the stage of verifying evidence, the struggle in the courtroom reached a new climax. The "witnesses" who testified for the prosecution authorities not only failed to provide any real evidence; on the contrary, the questions and exposures from the defense lawyers and the defendant's bench made these "witnesses" extremely embarrassed. As a result, two of the four "witnesses" scheduled to appear in court claimed to be ill and did not come.

    The first "witness," Riester, was completely exposed as soon as he appeared in court. According to defense lawyer Kaul, Riester had been working for the West German intelligence agency "Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution" since April 1953. Kaul produced a photo of Riester's past confession record on the spot, proving that he had admitted to providing intelligence through a post office box in Cologne to a so-called state-established "opinion survey institute" and had received payment for it. Under questioning and exposure, this "witness" was full of contradictions and finally had to admit that he was "completely confused." It is worth noting that this "witness" admitted that he had never been a staff member of the peace movement, did not know any of the defendants, and could not say anything about the political and organizational aspects of the Peace Committee. Bringing such a "witness" to testify precisely proves that the West German ruling authorities are using despicable means to persecute the peace and democratic movement and frame peace fighters.

    The other "witness," Roland, was similarly questioned in court until he was full of contradictions, and even the presiding judge had to sigh and say: "Now you are completely confused!" Even more ridiculous was that the prosecutor rushed forward to defend this "witness," saying that this was not a contradiction but that he was not feeling well and was confused by the defendants' questions. At that time, despite repeated prohibitions by the judge and bailiffs, bursts of contemptuous laughter constantly erupted in the courtroom.

    In order to prove the defendants' guilt, the prosecution authorities even produced fabricated evidence. But their deception was quickly exposed.

    It was not enough that the witnesses were embarrassed on the spot; the "physical evidence" did not make the court and prosecution authorities any easier either. The judges read out documents that they had brought as evidence, but these were nothing more than articles and speeches publicly published by peace fighters over the years, as well as statements from the Peace Committee. From these documents, people once again heard the righteous calls for peace and opposition to war, which is the best proof of the peace fighters' heroic struggle for peace.

    An official of the West German Peace Committee stated that the public's opposition to the West German government's atomic armament is constantly growing. Today, wherever the Bundeswehr establishes a new missile base, the people there will absolutely not remain silent. The development of the peace movement naturally makes the Bonn ruling authorities, who pursue militarist policies, feel afraid. Therefore, for ten years, peace and progressive organizations and individuals in West Germany have been constantly subjected to interference and persecution. The first so-called "Criminal Law Amendment Act" announced by Bonn in August 1951 became the "basis" for the prosecution of these seven peace fighters. In West Germany, the peace movement has always been subjected to police harassment. This trial by the West German authorities of seven peace fighters, including the main persons in charge of the Peace Committee, is an attempt to "legalize" past police actions by convicting them, and then to ban the activities of all Peace Committee local organizations and suppress the peace and democratic movement. This series of facts shows that the West German authorities are further intensifying their fascist rule.

    However, like all reactionary rulers, the West German authorities' measures to frantically suppress the peace and democratic forces do not indicate their strength but rather their weakness and fear. Even in this trial, the prosecution was initially filed in 1952. After seven years of preparation, the West German government repeatedly took illegal measures to search the Peace Committee. But it was not until now that the trial was opened, which precisely shows that the West German rulers are very afraid of the impact of a public trial and the protests it would cause from the public at home and abroad. It is revealed that some senior figures in the West German ruling group have also admitted that trying this case is a very thorny matter. Therefore, during the trial, the West German authorities tried their best to block news of the trial. For a month, West German newspapers have hardly mentioned this trial, and many West German residents do not even know that the trial of seven famous peace fighters is currently underway.

    However, despite this, through the persistent struggle of peace organizations and individuals, the news of the illegal trial has been spread. Representatives from all over West Germany are constantly being sent to Dusseldorf to attend the hearing and report the news of the trial. The situation of the trial has aroused widespread protests from people of all walks of life in West Germany. A representative from Hesse said that everyone who heard the news of the trial was surprised and angry. They asked why peace fighters were being tried when there was a general demand for easing the situation. The public in various places also held continuous protest rallies, demanding an immediate end to this illegal trial. Internationally, this illegal trial has also aroused strong condemnation from public opinion in various countries. Police suppression and illegal trials cannot stop the development of the West German peace movement. In places where Peace Committee local organizations have been banned, peace activists continue to struggle.

    反动法庭关不住和平战士的吼声
    记西德杜塞尔多夫州法院对爱国和平战士的非法审讯
    李越
    庄严的宣告，愤怒的控诉，尖锐的揭露和谴责——这就是西德和平战士们四周来在杜塞尔多夫州法院的法庭上对西德反动当局所进行的胜利斗争。
    从11月10日开始，西德司法当局对七位爱国和平人士进行了非法审讯。罪名是“破坏宪法和刑事犯罪秘密组织首领”。四周以来，和平战士们在法庭上的英勇斗争，使得西德检察和司法当局越来越陷入被动和狼狈境地。
    一开始，法庭不顾正义和人道强使七十一岁高龄并且患病多年的女和平战士、世界和平理事会理事和西德和平委员会第一主席蒙德夫人带病受审。但是，在舆论的坚决反对下，法庭最后不得不同意“暂时停止”对她的审讯。蒙德夫人在离开法庭时发表声明表示，对于她的工作和人格所受的无理攻击，一定要坚决进行斗争。在法庭上，旁听的人们都带着崇敬与义愤交织的心情，目送这位被辩护律师们抬着的几乎瘫痪了的勇敢老人走出法庭。
    在头三周的七次审讯中，六位和平战士在法庭上的发言，成为对西德当局有力的控诉。
    世界和平理事会理事、西德和平委员会第二主席艾克特在法庭上有力地指出，积极进行原子武装的西德当局反对为亿万人民所拥护的斯德哥尔摩宣言和世界和平理事会的宣言，这就证明了世界和平运动和西德和平委员会展开活动的必要性和正义性。他宣称：我们不怕这种审讯，我们将继续反对波恩政府的战争政策。
    两位基督教徒被告——迪尔和奥伯霍福也在法庭上宣称，他们参加保卫和平的斗争，是由于基督教道德观念的驱使。他们还表示支持同他们一起为和平而斗争的共产党人。五十多岁的奥伯霍福牧师在讲话中，坚决表示他过去说的“光是为和平祈祷还不够，必须为争取和平而斗争”这句话是正确的。他的慷慨激昂的讲话，赢得了不少人的赞同。这使得检察官坐立不安，不止一次要求法官制止他“用这种形式在这里发表演说”。但是，这位牧师根本不理睬他们，照旧用他有力的声调宣扬着和平的真理。
    曾经参加过捍卫西班牙共和制度的战争的沃耳拉特，尖锐地指责了西德秘密警察对和平战士的迫害。他在驳斥所谓和平委员会受人“雇佣”的这种诬蔑时指出，西德的广大群众运动就是和平委员会的基础，人们以争取和平的斗争支持西德和平委员会的活动。沃耳拉特以无可辩驳的事实，揭露了西德阿登纳的基督教民主联盟及其附属组织每年都从大资本家的工业联合会拿到几亿马克的资助。他的有力揭露，使得惯于诬蔑别人受“雇佣”的检察官哑口无言。
    法庭的审讯，不仅变成和平战士宣扬正义的讲台，而且也成为他们谴责波恩政府法西斯统治的场合。被告康帕拉在法庭上痛斥波恩政府“解放东部地区”的谰言和让屠杀过许多波兰人的奥伯兰德尔继续担任部长。检察官像被什么刺了一下似的，站起来威吓他说，要记下他的话，提出控告。但是，康帕拉理直气壮地说，他绝不怕这种控告，他可以在任何时候为他的讲话提供证明。
    被告们的庄严宣告和愤怒控诉，引起了旁听席上的极大同情和支持。出席旁听的国际民主妇联代表古普塔夫人，在叙述她的印象时说，被告是多么确信不疑地捍卫着和平事业；他们在审讯过程中的发言，是对扩大和加强世界和平运动的贡献。
    当审讯进入了核对证据的阶段之后，法庭上的斗争达到一个新的高潮。为检察当局作证的“证人”不但提不出任何真正的证据；相反，从辩护律师和被告席上发出的质问和揭露却使得这些“证人”狼狈万分。结果预定出庭的四个“证人”有两个都称病不来了。
    第一个“证人”里斯特一出庭就被揭露得体无完肤。据辩护律师考尔揭露，里斯特从1953年4月起就为西德特务机关“联邦宪法保卫局”工作。考尔当场拿出一份里斯特过去的供词记录照片，证明他当时承认曾经通过科隆的邮政信箱向一个所谓国家设立的“意见调查所”提供过情报，并为此得到报酬。这个“证人”在质问和揭露下，矛盾百出，最后只得承认他“完全混乱”了。值得注意的是，这个“证人”承认他从来不是和平运动的工作人员，也不认识被告中的任何一个人，更讲不出任何关于和平委员会的政治和组织方面的情况。搞这样一个“证人”出庭作证，恰恰证明西德统治当局是在使用卑劣手段迫害和平民主运动，诬陷和平战士。
    另一个“证人”罗兰在法庭上同样被人们问得矛盾百出之后，连法庭庭长也不得不叹息地说：“现在你完全一塌糊涂了！”更令人发笑的是，检察官这时赶忙抢上前去为这个“证人”辩解说，这不是矛盾，而是他身体不大好，被被告们的问题把他弄乱了。当时尽管庭长和法警一再制止，法庭中还是不断爆发出一阵阵轻蔑的笑声。
    为了证明被告的罪状，检察当局甚至搬出捏造的证据。但是很快他们的骗局就被揭穿了。
    人证当场出丑还不算，“物证”也并没有使法庭和检察当局轻松一些。法官们拿来作为证据宣读的，不过是和平战士们多年来公开发表的文章、讲演以及和平委员会的声明等文件。人们从这些文件中，又一次听到要求和平、反对战争的正义呼声，这正是和平战士们为和平而英勇奋斗的最好证明。
    一位西德和平委员会负责人发表谈话说，目前群众反对西德政府搞原子武装的情绪正不断地增长。今天只要国防军在什么地方搞新的导弹基地，那里的人民绝对不会保持沉默。和平运动的发展，当然使得奉行军国主义政策的波恩统治当局感到害怕，因此十年来西德的和平进步组织和人士不断遭受干涉和迫害。1951年8月波恩宣布实施的第一个所谓“刑事法修改法”，就成为对这七位和平战士的起诉的“根据”。在西德，和平运动一直是受到警察的摧残的。西德当局这次审讯包括和平委员会主要负责人在内的七位和平战士，就是企图通过对他们作出判决来使过去的警察行动“合法化”，进而禁止所有和平委员会地方组织的活动，镇压和平民主运动。这一系列的事实说明，西德当局正在进一步加紧法西斯统治。
    但是，同一切反动统治者一样，西德当局疯狂镇压和平民主力量的措施，并不说明它的强大，却正好说明是它的虚弱和恐惧。即以这次审讯来看，最初提出起诉，还是在1952年，经过七年时间的准备，西德政府曾多次对和平委员会采取非法手段进行搜查。但直到现在才开庭审讯，这正说明西德统治者十分害怕公开审讯造成的影响和引起国内外公众的抗议。据透露，西德统治集团中有些高级人员也曾经承认，审理这一案件是一件很棘手的事。因此在审讯时，西德当局竭力封锁审讯的消息。一个月来，西德报纸对这次审讯几乎一字不提，很多西德居民甚至根本不知道现在正在进行对七位著名和平战士的审讯这回事。
    但是，尽管如此，通过和平组织和人士的坚持斗争，非法审讯的消息还是被传播开了。西德各地不断派代表到杜塞尔多夫来旁听，把审讯的消息报道出去。审讯的情况，引起了西德各地各阶层人士的广泛抗议。一位来自黑森州的代表说，凡是听到审讯消息的人，都感到惊讶和愤怒。他们问为什么在普遍要求局势缓和的时候，竟对和平战士进行审讯。各地公众并不断举行抗议集会，要求立即停止这种非法审讯。在国际上，这一非法审讯同样引起了各国公众舆论的强烈谴责。警察镇压和非法审讯，并不能阻挡西德和平运动的发展。在和平委员会地方组织已经被禁止的地方，和平人士仍在继续斗争。　　　　（附图片）
