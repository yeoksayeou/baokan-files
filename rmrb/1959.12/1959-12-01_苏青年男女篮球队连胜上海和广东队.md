The visiting women's team defeated the Guangdong women's team 66-58, and the men's team defeated the Guangdong men's team 90-56.

    In the women's team match, the competition was very fierce, with the score tied twelve times throughout the game. The visiting team led 32-31 in the first half.

With three minutes left, the score was tied at 54. Afterwards, Laya Salimova, a 1.98-meter-tall player for the visiting team, showed her skills under the basket, scoring four consecutive goals, which decided the victory.

    In the men's team match, the tall visiting athletes took the initiative tonight with fast attacks and accurate shooting, leading 42-25 at the end of the first half. The Guangdong team adopted a mixed defense tactic of frontcourt press and backcourt zone defense tonight, but there were many loopholes. Their players were also not very accurate in shooting when attacking, and finally lost to the visiting team by 34 points.

    The Soviet National Youth Men's and Women's Basketball Teams will leave Shanghai for Beijing on December 2nd, and then return to their country.
