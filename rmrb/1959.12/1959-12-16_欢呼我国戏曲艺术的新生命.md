    Hail the New Life of Chinese Opera Art
    Ma Shaobo
    A Riot of Color in Full Bloom
    The past ten years have been a great ten years. In these ten years, our motherland has fundamentally changed its old face, and the cause of socialist construction has developed by leaps and bounds, entering a new era of prosperity and strength. Opera work is only a small aspect of the motherland's socialist construction cause. Although this aspect is small, the changes are unprecedented and enormous. Such great achievements would have been impossible in the old era and absolutely unimaginable at that time.
    No one will forget that in the era of old China, due to the indifference and destruction of the reactionary ruling class, many opera genres were lost and scattered, living a miserable existence of self-birth and self-destruction! The artists suffered insults and oppression, untold pain and bitterness! Opera was on the verge of "imminent danger."
    In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Mao issued a resounding call, putting forward the policy of "making the old serve the new." He gave very clear instructions on how to treat the cultural heritage of the motherland:
    "China's long feudal society created a splendid ancient culture. To clear away the process of development of this ancient culture, to discard its feudal dross and assimilate its democratic essence is a necessary condition for developing our new national culture and increasing our national self-confidence, but we can never accept it uncritically and indiscriminately. We must separate all the decadent things of the ancient feudal ruling class from the excellent ancient people's culture which was more or less democratic and revolutionary in character. China's present new politics and new economy have developed from the old politics and old economy of ancient times, and China's present new culture has also developed from the old culture of ancient times. Therefore, we must respect our own history and must not break with history. But this respect means giving history its proper place as a science, respecting the dialectical development of history, and not eulogizing the past and disparaging the present, and not praising any feudal poison. ..." ("On New Democracy")
    Under the glorious light of this great policy, the opera reform workers in Yan'an and various liberated areas at that time carried out various attempts to inherit and innovate the opera art, mainly Peking Opera art, and accumulated some useful experience.
    In 1949, the whole country was liberated. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution first brought about the liberation of the artists themselves. Their social status was no longer one of being insulted and oppressed; instead, they were respected and cared for. Opera art was regarded as a huge and precious wealth of the people and was unprecedentedly valued and cherished.
    In 1950, the Party and Chairman Mao further put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and making the old serve the new." This policy, like a lighthouse, illuminated the way forward for opera work throughout the country.
    Over the past ten years, an unprecedentedly new look and prosperous scene have appeared on the national opera stage. After excavation, sorting, and reform, there are currently more than 400 types of opera in the country. The number of professional opera troupes has developed to 2,569, with more than 166,000 opera performers. More than 50,000 traditional plays have been excavated and sorted, and new plays have been adapted and created. People often use "a riot of color in full bloom" to describe the splendid and prosperous scene of Chinese opera art, and this metaphor is very accurate.
        The East Wind Smiles Back to the Hundred Flowers Spring
    The reason why China's opera has developed so vigorously is due to the Party's formulation of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and making the old serve the new" and the correct implementation of this policy. It once again proves the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought—the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.
    "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" means allowing all progressive artistic flowers created by the people to flourish and develop without exception, and to continuously innovate and improve in friendly free competition, mutual learning, and close cooperation, so that they can better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve the socialist cause, and better meet the needs of the broad masses of the people. "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" requires each opera genre to be rich and diverse in terms of themes, forms, artistic schools, and artistic styles, each with its own unique style.
    The proposal of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" is completely in line with objective requirements. It reflects China's long-standing artistic traditions and the rich and beautiful artistic heritage, reflects the broad masses' diverse hobbies and interests in art, and reflects the broad masses of art workers' demand to fully unleash their creativity in art after being politically liberated. And "making the old serve the new" is the correct approach to solving the inheritance and innovation of Chinese opera tradition on the basis of "letting a hundred flowers bloom." "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and making the old serve the new" are complementary and dialectically unified.
    China's opera heritage is the result of the people's genius creation. It not only has a long history, rich content, and exquisite techniques, but also always maintains a close spiritual connection with the broad masses of the people. Most of the plays have a strong popular character and a positive spirit of realism. They expose the darkness of the old society, reflect the noble character of the ancient people, and the various tenacious struggles of the people against oppressors under the oppression of the feudal system. They vividly depict the life of the ancient people, express their love and hate, joy and sorrow, as well as their yearning and pursuit for a better life. For thousands of years, countless unforgettable artistic images and their stories and legends have played a profound educational and inspiring force among the broad masses of the people, even in remote and backward areas.
    Of course, many of China's operas originated in the feudal era and were once wantonly utilized and distorted by the feudal rulers. Therefore, some parts of them inevitably carry feudal and backward elements. However, the people's love and hate are clear, which is exactly the opposite of the will of the feudal rulers. The people's true sympathy is always on the side of the oppressed and bullied, and they have always expressed unparalleled anger and contempt for those vicious oppressors and exploiters. From ancient feudal dynasties to the period of Kuomintang reactionary rule, this kind of sharp and tortuous struggle has been going on in the field of opera. Therefore, although due to the limitations of historical conditions, a small number of plays are completely harmful and useless to the people; however, the vast majority of plays are gems and pearls, but these gems and pearls are always covered with a layer of dust, or have some kind of defect and damage. The popular character and feudal character are in a state of mutual entanglement. In order to protect the heritage, develop the tradition, and make it better serve the people and the current political affairs, Marxists have the responsibility to earnestly "discard its feudal dross and absorb its democratic essence" so as to carry it forward. This is the basis and spiritual essence of "making the old serve the new."
        Advancing Through the Waves
    How to establish China's new opera art, although there are no ready-made systematic experiences to follow in practice, under the Party's cordial care and specific guidance, the following issues were first resolved from the beginning of the founding of the country: 1. The issue of raising the social status of opera artists. 2. The standards of essence and dross, good plays and bad plays. 3. The issue of banning or not banning plays, and how to ban plays. 4. Clarifying the stage image. 5. The issue of transferring a large number of new literary and art workers to participate in opera reform work. 6. The excavation and sorting of plays of various genres and mutual observation to improve. 7. Appropriately arranging the expression of historical themes and modern life themes according to the different characteristics of opera genres. 8. The issue of ideological remolding of opera workers. 9. The issue of cultivating the younger generation. 10. Carrying out opera research work and strengthening artistic experimental demonstration work.
    In 1950, the Ministry of Culture, through opera research institutions involving representatives of the drama circle and the National Opera Work Conference, seriously discussed the situation of opera reform work in the country and ways to improve it. In 1951, the Government Administration Council issued the "Instructions on Opera Reform Work," which pointed out: The "most important thing at this time is the lack of unified standards for reviewing plays, and there are still some anti-historical and dogmatic tendencies in the work of compiling and revising scripts." The standard for reviewing plays was put forward: "Opera should take promoting the people's new patriotic spirit and inspiring the people's heroism in revolutionary struggle and productive labor as the primary task. Operas that promote resistance to aggression, resistance to oppression, love of the motherland, love of freedom, love of labor, and commend the people's justice and their good character should be encouraged and promoted. On the contrary, operas that promote feudal slave morality, advocate barbaric terror or obscene and poisonous behavior, and uglify and insult the working people should be opposed."
    Regarding the issue of whether to ban or not ban plays, the instructions also made clear provisions: "Carrying out reform should mainly rely on the concerted cooperation of the broad masses of artists, relying on them to jointly review, revise, and write scripts, and relying on newspapers and periodicals to appropriately launch opera criticism. Generally, it should not rely on administrative orders and banning performances." That is to say, the method of banning plays is generally not used to clarify the chaotic phenomenon of plays, but the method of compiling and reviewing together with the artists is adopted to sort out the plays while improving the artists' understanding, giving play to the artists' creativity, and at the same time, the effect of opera work cadres learning from the artists is achieved. If a not-so-good play comes out, the method of banning the play is not adopted, but the method of criticism is used to publicly discuss it in newspapers and periodicals to influence the audience and the troupe. As for those operas that are seriously poisonous to the people and must be banned, the instructions strictly stipulate: "It should be handled uniformly by the Ministry of Culture, and localities shall not ban performances without authorization."
    In addition, effective measures were also taken on how to promote the healthy, beautiful, and correct side of the stage image, eliminate the morbid, ugly, and distorted side, and mobilize and organize a large number of new literary and art workers to enrich the opera reform team and inject new blood, and good results were quickly achieved. Moreover, opera festivals were held continuously in Beijing and throughout the country to provide conditions for mutual observation and learning among various genres. Through these activities, correct evaluations and due respect for each genre and artist played a great role in boosting morale. In 1950, the Ministry of Culture established the Chinese Opera School, and then opera schools or young actors' study teams were established in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, and other provinces and cities, and the training of new forces began. Specialized opera research institutions were established to systematically conduct theoretical research, and experimental and demonstrative theaters and troupes were established one after another in various genres to carry out popularization and improvement work in a planned way.
    From the beginning of the founding of the country, the Party's line and policy were correctly implemented in opera work. However, due to the different angles and depths of understanding of the policy by some comrades, or due to the inheritance of certain traditional erroneous concepts, some shortcomings and errors also occurred. Therefore, the practice process of implementing the policy has always been a process of continuous persuasion and overcoming of those who despise tradition, arbitrarily tamper with crude styles, hasty moods trying to achieve success in one fell swoop, and conservative ideas that adhere to the status quo and refuse to reform.
    At that time, the anti-historical tendency of some comrades in opera reform was more prominent. Observing and depicting history with the modern working class's thinking is completely different from depicting the historical figures of ancient history as the modern working class's thinking. The former is correct, and the latter is wrong. Some comrades did not strictly distinguish between them in theory and practice. Some even used ancient stories to expound "social development history," or made historical figures go beyond a certain historical category, very far-fetchedly alluding to and comparing with the reality of modern struggle. The serious criticism conducted in this regard at that time played a role in improving how to treat history and historical-themed opera creation.
    At the same time, the discussion initially clarified the difference between mythology and superstition. Whether it is mythology or superstition, they both reflect the ancient people's naive understanding of the world and a belief in supernatural power. But the meanings of the two are very different. The difference lies in the essence of thought, and it cannot be judged solely by appearance. Although mythology also originates from the ancient people's naive fantasy about natural phenomena, it reflects people's protests against social injustice or their pursuit of an ideal world. The most obvious characteristic is that they are unwilling to succumb to fate and take a positive attitude towards the world; superstition, on the other hand, is the opposite. It promotes the fatalistic view of cause and effect and retribution, which allows people to be content with fate and bow their heads in the face of fate in order to maintain the interests of the ruling class. Correctly treating mythology and superstition has played a great protective role in excellent mythological plays. In addition, the discussion promoted the correct development of opera plays on how to understand the popular character, how to understand the relationship between politics and art, how to correctly understand the truth of life and the truth of art, and how to distinguish between vulgar pornography and healthy love.
    From the first National Opera Festival to the first National Opera Program Work Conference in 1956, under the leadership of the Party, a large number of excellent plays emerged in opera art, and opera art has had a vigorous development; but there are still imbalances. In specific practice, some comrades have a vague understanding of the Party's policy. Therefore, some simple and crude phenomena that do not specifically analyze specific plays have occurred in opera criticism. At the same time, the conservative thinking of some comrades also seriously exists, manifested in being very obsessed with the past, satisfied with certain achievements of predecessors or their own existing achievements, adhering to the status quo, being complacent, and lacking habit, confidence, and enthusiasm for new viewpoints and new creations. This also plays an obstructive role in the development of opera art.
    In view of the above situation, the Ministry of Culture convened the National Opera Program Work Conference in 1956 to discuss and resolve it. The meeting also emphasized that each genre must sort out and perform its own excellent traditional plays, and should not just transplant the plays of fraternal genres. Subsequently, a number of opera actor training classes and learning institutions such as opera academies were established to strengthen the artistic advanced studies of actors and other artistic personnel, invite veteran artists to perform demonstrations, and systematically sort out their artistic experience.
    Artistic conservatism is often due to the rigidification of the laws of traditional art in cognition, which are regarded as static and unchanging things; and crudeness is often due to the lack of precise research and mastery of the laws and characteristics of traditional art in reform and creation, so the essential parts are lacked correct understanding and arbitrarily discarded, damaging the original characteristics that should be maintained. Conservative or crude attitudes are generally caused by vague understanding and insufficient experience, but they are only individual and temporary phenomena, and they are gradually corrected and improved through comradely criticism and discussion.
    Over the past ten years, thanks to the Party's correct policies and the cordial care and education of the artists, the ideological outlook of the opera circle has undergone significant changes, and the old system has undergone fundamental changes. This is the result of implementing the Party's policy, and it is also the material basis for continuing to implement the Party's policy.
    Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party, the artists have gradually overcome old ideas and old styles, established new ideas and new styles, and continuously improved politically, culturally, and artistically. They have further understood the country's policies, penetrated the people's lives and struggles, and clarified the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. From 1949 to 1951, "opera actor training classes" were held in various provinces and cities across the country, and the artists initially understood the relationship between art and politics, and clarified that opera art is not only for entertainment, but more importantly, it is for educating the people. Therefore, they began to engage in artistic creation with a cautious attitude. A series of political movements and democratic reforms after liberation purified the opera team and promoted ideological revolution; especially through the rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, the political and ideological consciousness of the artists has been significantly improved. They are closely united around the Party, enthusiastically working for the socialist construction of the motherland, and bravely advancing on the road of becoming both red and expert. Many opera artists have honorably joined the Communist Party of China.
    Over the past ten years, the ancient and excellent national art traditions have been correctly inherited and developed, and art and artists have been truly valued and respected. The older generation of artists are settled in their respective positions and are making the best use of their talents; the new generation of talents is emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Every genre, every troupe, and every opera school in the country has produced many rising stars without exception. Every elderly or middle-aged artist (including actors and musicians) has his or her proud successor. Because the policy of "all-round development and teaching students in accordance with their aptitude" is resolutely implemented in the training, these newcomers love the motherland, love the people, love the Party, love socialism, and love peace; their art, after the careful carving of famous teachers, has a solid foundation; and students who graduate from opera schools have reached a cultural level equivalent to high school.
    The road of opera reform is not smooth and unobstructed, and there is also a sharp struggle between two roads. Everyone still remembers that in the work of opera reform, two giants once stood in the way: one was the national nihilism represented by the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng. Hu Feng advocated that all literature and art before the "May Fourth" movement were "feudal literature and art," so he regarded Chinese opera as his mortal enemy and adopted a completely negative attitude. This reactionary fellow clamored in every possible way: whoever wants to inherit and develop the national opera tradition, whoever wants to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and making the old serve the new," whoever is a "old activist," "nationalist," or "national revivalist." The other was the national essenceism represented by rightist elements Wu Zuguang and Zhang Boju. They did not criticize the opera heritage at all, and completely prostrated themselves. They had great interest in feudal dross and backward things, and even openly raised the banner of "protecting the national essence" to resist the Party's policies and guidelines; they expressed extreme disgust and hatred for any progress in opera reform. In their eyes, the dazzling opera reform movement was a dark mass. Although these two reactionary waves originated from the same source—the reactionary ideology of the feudal class and the bourgeoisie that were anti-Party and anti-socialist—in form, they appeared in two different guises and from different aspects. In 1955 and 1957, the Party carried out the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and the anti-rightist struggle, resolutely smashed their attacks, and further enhanced the revolutionary consciousness of the literary and art circles, including the opera circles. From the perspective of opera work alone, this great struggle indeed cleared the way for the development of opera art.
    After the anti-rightist struggle, more profound changes took place in the opera circle. People's ideological consciousness was generally improved, and revolutionary enthusiasm was greatly enhanced. Then, like thousands of troops and horses, they plunged into the torrent of the Great Leap Forward, implementing the general line of socialist construction. By rushing to the mountains, going to the countryside, entering factories, and going to the troops to deliver operas to their doorsteps and carrying out labor training, strengthening the integration with workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers more deeply, and serving socialist construction, the political awareness of the broad masses of opera workers was unprecedentedly improved.
    The improvement of political thought inspired and encouraged the masses' high creative enthusiasm. They sang for socialism, danced for socialism, and everyone was overjoyed and full of energy. Since the Great Leap Forward, in the spirit of "walking on two legs," opera theaters and troupes across the country have achieved great success in sorting out and adapting traditional scripts, creating new historical dramas, and experimenting with new plays expressing modern themes. From April 1958 to this year's National Day, the number of plays sorted out, created, and performed has almost doubled. Some units have completed more than ten times the number of plays completed in the same period in the past. The ideological and artistic quality of many plays has also been greatly enriched and improved compared with the past. The older generation of artists are always young, and the new forces are full of vitality. A new situation of unprecedented prosperity has been formed. This year's celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China by the opera circles across the country, with a hundred flowers offering auspicious signs and ten thousand purples and reds, is a concentrated expression of this new situation.
        Red Flowers Are Even Redder
    The experience of the past ten years proves that the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and making the old serve the new" put forward by the Party and Chairman Mao is completely correct and very great. Under the glorious light of Mao Zedong Thought, China's opera art circles have launched an unprecedentedly lively mass movement, making China's ancient, rich, and colorful opera art stride from the category of old literature and art to the category of new literature and art.
    Over the past ten years, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on two roads in China's literary and art circles has been like a red thread running through the history of China's socialist literature and art, and the work of opera reform is no exception. The nature of these struggles includes contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, and contradictions within the people, but they are all reflections of class struggle. For a period of time, some "well-intentioned" people simply could not see the existence of class struggle in the opera circle. Of course, they may admit the class contradiction between artists and feudal headmen, but the problem is not limited to this. The more in-depth ideological struggle is the reflection of class struggle in the ideological field during the socialist revolution stage in China. The anti-rightist struggle in the opera circle crushed the attacks of the rightist elements, and at the same time prompted some well-intentioned comrades to wake up from their dreams.
    The Party's policy of "combining unity and education" will always be an important basis for political work in the opera circle. In the opera circle, the vast majority of comrades love the Party and love socialism. This is the basis of unity. However, starting from the desire for unity to achieve the goal of greater unity and progress, there is still a certain ideological struggle between them. It is mainly manifested in the differences between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology at times. As long as there are principled differences, these differences should not be blurred. It is very wrong to consciously or unconsciously blur these differences. Over the past ten years, the political consciousness of the opera circle has been generally improved. This is an undeniable fact, but we cannot be satisfied with this. In the future, strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism, going deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, closely integrating with the masses in labor, work, and life, exercising and transforming ourselves, actively overcoming the bourgeois individualism's thinking of fame and profit, establishing the proletarian collectivist thinking, and establishing the communist worldview are the goals of our common efforts.
    To continue to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and making the old serve the new" also lies in constantly overcoming the traditional inertia and conservative forces that are deeply rooted in the opera circle. This traditional inertia and conservative forces often consciously or unconsciously play a negative role in the development of art and the growth of the new generation.
    The facts of the past ten years have proved that the correct inheritance and development in art and the vigorous growth of new forces are important signs of whether a genre is full of vitality. Therefore, correct and bold creation and innovation and support and training for new forces have become important issues in the progress of opera work. Any suspicion, indifference, or even taking a cold-water attitude towards new people and new things will have a harmful impact on the people's opera cause.
    Over the past ten years, many genres have attached importance to the training of new forces, showing the genre's unlimited future of youth. This is mainly due to the Party's strong support and correct leadership, but it is also inseparable from the careful teaching of many veteran artists. The most prominent feature of the genres with significant achievements in this regard is that when the veteran artists train the new generation, it is not an individualistic attitude, but starts from the interests of the people's opera cause, and unifies the interests of the individual with the interests of the socialist cause: the growth of the new forces not only makes the art of the predecessors inherited and continuous, but also makes the genre revitalized with youth and unlimited prospects. "Metabolism" is always an objective law. What's more, now that the times have changed, the system has changed, and the relationship between people has also undergone fundamental changes. The new society respects and values ​​veteran artists, and also values ​​the training of new forces. All of this is for the future of drama art, and for better service to the people. The train of the times is constantly advancing. We should be protectors and promoters of new things and new forces, and resolutely wage a determined struggle against those bourgeois ideas and habits that suppress and exclude new people and new things.
    The experience of the past ten years proves that adhering to putting politics in command, consolidating the Party's leadership, implementing the mass line, and serving the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the unshakable principles of opera work. Since the Great Leap Forward, there have been people in the opera circle who have expressed doubts and wavered about implementing the Party's general line of building socialism in opera work. It can be seen that the ideological front in the opera circle has not been calm, and this cannot but arouse our serious vigilance.
    The experience of the past ten years proves that the Party's opera reform policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and making the old serve the new" is a deeply rooted and invincible work guideline. How to eliminate the dross and retain the essence from the content to the art form of opera is a very meticulous and complex work, and it must be treated seriously. On the other hand, the new era has broken the barriers of mutual isolation between various genres, and prepared sufficient conditions for mutual learning and mutual absorption of nutrients between genres. This has an excellent effect on the common improvement of various genres. However, when learning and absorbing from each other, attention should also be paid to maintaining the characteristics of the genre. There are common laws between any genres, but each genre itself, and even each play itself, has its own special laws and characteristics. To absorb things from fraternal genres, it should be bold and widely collected, but it must be digested and assimilated according to its own laws and characteristics.
    The new life of China's opera art lies more in the courage to "make the old serve the new" from the ideological content and artistic form, and correctly solve the relationship between inheritance and development. It respects and inherits the achievements of predecessors, and gives play to the spirit of originality, is good at learning, is diligent in practice, is courageous in creation, and strives to improve the ideological and artistic quality of the performed plays. It is not an improvement of one branch or one leaf, but a comprehensive improvement of stage art. Do not be intimidated by the achievements of predecessors, do not lie on the heritage and keep the status quo, and have great ambitions to surpass predecessors in all aspects. "The student surpasses the teacher," is the law of social development and the law of artistic development. The process of "making the old serve the new" is also a process of continuous revolution.
    The spirit of "making the old serve the new" is also manifested in the plays that reflect modern life. Various genres across the country have created very good achievements in expressing the life and struggle of contemporary people. Even ancient genres such as Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera, where there are greater contradictions between traditional forms and new content, have begun to make relatively successful attempts, and this should continue to be worked on. Whether historical plays or modern plays are needed by the people, and the proportion of more or less, sooner or later, faster or slower, should depend on the actual conditions of each genre or each troupe. For example, for ancient genres such as Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera, the proportion of modern plays should not be too large, because its inherent form is better at expressing historical life themes. Moreover, there is still a process of exploration and experimentation in expressing modern life themes, so we should adhere to the principle of being small but refined, insist on experimentation, and continuously accumulate experience; and continue to sort out, adapt, and create historical plays, and expand its strengths. Because in the past, now, and even in the more distant future, these traditional plays or new historical plays are still needed and welcomed by the broad masses of the people.
    Under the premise of putting politics in command, we should unswervingly continue to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and making the old serve the new" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend," vigorously advocate the diversification of themes, styles, and forms, and advocate free debate on academic issues and free competition of different artistic schools, so as to mobilize the active forces of all opera workers to develop and prosper the new opera of the socialist era. At the same time, we must pay special attention to the ideological nature and spirit of the times of the performed plays, and strive for artistic exquisiteness and completeness, make full use of technical conditions, and enhance the power of artistic expression and infection, so that China's opera art can reach the level required by the great era.
    The creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, in addition to focusing on correctly expressing the content of the socialist and communist era, should also be applicable to the life themes from the democratic revolution period all the way back to the past dynasties. The basis for using this creative method to deal with historical themes is the Marxist-Leninist historical and aesthetic viewpoints. It enables the historical events and character images we deal with to be both within a certain historical scope in artistic expression, and higher, more concentrated, stronger, more typical, and more spiritually connected with today's audience than the original life, exert a positive influence, and achieve "making the past serve the present."
    Over the past ten years, the achievements of China's opera art cause have been enormous, but compared with the speed of development of industrial and agricultural production and the brilliant achievements of the entire country's construction, it is just a "drop in the ocean." The increasing needs of the people's cultural life require us to make a hundred times more effort. Our motherland, with such an ancient and excellent artistic tradition and such a large and upward artistic team, will surely climb the peak of the world's advanced art.

    欢呼我国戏曲艺术的新生命
    马少波
    姹紫嫣红开遍
    过去的十年是伟大的十年。在这十年中，我们的祖国根本改变了旧面貌，社会主义建设事业在飞跃地发展，进入了一个繁荣富强的新时代。戏曲工作只不过是祖国社会主义建设事业的一个小小侧面，这个侧面虽小，可是变化也是空前巨大的。这样大的成就在旧时代根本不可能有，也是那时候绝对不可想像的事。
    人们谁也不会忘记，在旧中国的时代，由于反动统治阶级的漠视和摧残，多少戏曲剧种湮没流散，处于自生自灭的悲惨境地！艺人们受侮辱、受压迫，说不尽的痛苦辛酸！戏曲已濒于“岌岌危矣”的边缘。
    在抗日战争初期，毛主席发出了响亮的号召，提出了“推陈出新”的方针，对于如何对待祖国的文化遗产，他作了十分明确的指示：
    “中国的长期封建社会中，创造了灿烂的古代文化。清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件；但是决不能无批判地兼收并蓄。必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的人民文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。中国现时的新政治新经济是从古代的旧政治旧经济发展而来的，中国现时的新文化也是从古代的旧文化发展而来，因此，我们必须尊重自己的历史，决不能割断历史。但是这种尊重，是给历史以一定的科学的地位，是尊重历史的辩证法的发展，而不是颂古非今，不是赞扬任何封建的毒素。……”（“新民主主义论”）
    在这一伟大方针的光辉照耀下，当时延安和各个解放区的戏曲改革工作者，对戏曲艺术主要是京剧艺术进行了继承和革新的各种尝试，积累了一些有益的经验。
    1949年全国解放。中国人民革命的胜利首先带给艺人的就是他们自身的解放，他们的社会地位不再是被侮辱、被压迫；而是被尊重、被关怀。戏曲艺术被看作人民的一笔巨大的宝贵财富，受到空前的重视和爱护。
    1950年党和毛主席又进一步提出了“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针。这一方针像灯塔一样，照亮了全国戏曲工作前进的道路。
    十年来，全国戏曲舞台上出现了空前未有的崭新面貌和繁荣景象，经过发掘、整理和改革，目前全国戏曲已有四百多种，戏曲专业剧团已发展到二千五百六十九个，戏曲队伍达十六万六千多人，挖掘整理的传统剧目和改编、创作的新剧目约有五万多出。人们常以“姹紫嫣红开遍”来形容我国戏曲艺术灿烂繁荣的景象，这种比喻是十分确切的。
        东风笑回百花春
    我国戏曲之所以如此蓬勃地发展，是由于党制定了“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针和正确地贯彻执行这一方针的结果。它又一次地证明了毛泽东思想——马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的伟大胜利。
    “百花齐放”，就是要使人民创造的各种进步的艺术花朵都无例外地得到繁荣和发展，并且在友谊的自由竞赛、互相学习和亲密协作中不断地革新和提高，使它们更好地为工农兵、为社会主义事业服务，更好地满足广大人民的需要。“百花齐放”，就每个剧种来讲，要求在题材、形式、艺术流派和艺术风格上丰富多样，独具风格。
    “百花齐放”的提出，是完全符合客观的要求的，它反映了我国悠久的艺术传统和艺术遗产的丰富优美，反映了广大群众对艺术的多方面的爱好和兴趣，反映了广大艺术工作者在政治上得到解放以后，还要求在艺术上充分发挥他们的创造力。而“推陈出新”是在“百花齐放”的基础上解决对中国戏曲传统的继承和革新问题的正确做法。“百花齐放，推陈出新”是相辅相成的，是辩证的统一。
    我国的戏曲遗产，是人民天才创造的成果。它不但有悠久的历史、丰富的内容和精湛的技术，而且始终保持了和广大人民的密切的精神联系。多数剧目具有浓厚的人民性和积极的现实主义精神，它揭露了旧社会的黑暗，反映了古代人民的高尚品德和人民在封建制度压迫下对压迫者所进行的各种坚强不屈的斗争。它们十分生动地描绘了古代人民的生活面貌，表达了他们的爱与憎、欢乐与悲哀，以及他们对美好生活的向往和追求。无数使人难忘的艺术形象和他们的故事传说，千百年来，哪怕是穷乡僻壤，无远不届，它在广大人民中间，发挥着深广的教育和鼓舞的力量。
    当然，我国的很多戏曲产生于封建时代，曾经被封建统治者肆意地加以利用和歪曲过，因而其中有些部分不可避免地带有封建性和落后的成分。不过，人民的爱憎是分明的，这和封建统治者的意志恰恰相反，人民的真正同情总是在被压迫者、被欺凌者的一面，而对于那些凶恶的压迫者、剥削者从来是表示无比的愤怒和蔑视的。从古代封建王朝到国民党反动统治时期，在戏曲领域内一直进行着这种尖锐的曲折的斗争。因而虽然由于历史条件的局限，其中有少数剧目对人民完全是有害无益的；但是绝大多数的剧目是宝石和珍珠，只不过是这些宝石和珍珠上面总不免蒙罩着一层灰尘，或有某种残缺和损伤，人民性和封建性处于一种互相纠结的状态。马克思主义者为了保护遗产，发展传统，使之更好地为人民服务，为当前的政治服务，就有责任认真地“剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华”，使之发扬光大。这就是“推陈出新”的根据及其精神实质。
        破浪前进
    如何建立我国新的戏曲艺术，虽然在实践中没有现成的系统的经验可以遵循，但在党的亲切关怀和具体指导下，从建国伊始，就首先解决了如下的几个问题：一、提高戏曲艺人社会地位的问题。二、精华和糟粕，好戏和坏戏的标准问题。三、禁不禁戏，怎样禁戏的问题。四、澄清舞台形象的问题。五、输送大批新文艺工作者参加戏曲改革工作的问题。六、各剧种的挖掘整理剧目和相互观摩提高的问题。七、根据戏曲剧种的不同特点适当安排表现历史题材和现代生活题材的问题。八、戏曲工作者思想改造的问题。九、培养青年一代的问题。十、开展戏曲研究工作和加强艺术上实验示范工作的问题。
    1950年，中央文化部通过包括戏剧界代表人物参加的戏曲研究机构和全国戏曲工作会议，认真讨论了全国戏曲改革工作的状况和改进的办法，1951年政务院颁布了“关于戏曲改革工作的指示”，指示中指出：这时期“最主要的是审定剧目缺乏统一标准，与编改剧本工作中还有某些反历史主义的、公式主义的倾向”。并提出了审定剧目的标准：“戏曲应以发扬人民新的爱国主义精神，鼓舞人民在革命斗争与生产劳动中的英雄主义为首要任务。凡宣传反抗侵略、反抗压迫、爱祖国、爱自由、爱劳动、表扬人民正义及其善良性格的戏曲应予鼓励和推广，反之，凡鼓吹封建奴隶道德、鼓吹野蛮恐怖或猥亵淫毒行为、丑化与侮辱劳动人民的戏曲应加以反对。”
    对于禁不禁戏的问题，指示中也作了明确的规定：“进行改革主要地应当依靠广大艺人的通力合作，依靠他们共同审定、修改与编写剧本，并依靠报纸刊物适当地展开戏曲批评，一般地不应当依靠行政命令与禁演的办法。”这就是说，一般不用禁戏的办法来澄清剧目的混乱现象，而是采用与艺人同编同审的办法来一面整理剧目，一面提高艺人的认识，发挥艺人的创造性，同时还收得戏曲工作干部向艺人学习的效果；如果出了不大好的剧目，也不采取禁戏的办法，而是运用批评的方法在报刊上公开讨论，以影响观众和剧团。至于那些对人民有严重毒素的戏曲必须禁演的，在指示中则严格规定：“应由中央文化部统一处理，各地不得擅自禁演。”
    此外，关于如何发扬舞台形象的健康、美丽、正确的一面，清除病态、丑恶、歪曲的一面，以及动员和组织大批新文艺工作者充实戏曲改革队伍，注入新的血液，也采取了有效的措施，很快就取得了良好的效果。并且在北京和全国各地连续举行了戏曲会演，为各剧种之间互相观摩学习提供条件。通过这些活动，对于每个剧种和艺术家们给以正确的评价和应有的尊重，起了极大的鼓舞士气的作用。1950年，中央文化部便成立了中国戏曲学校，接着北京、上海、武汉、沈阳，以及其他各省、市，都成立了戏曲学校或青年演员学习队，开始新生力量的培养。并成立了专门的戏曲研究机构，系统地进行理论研究，各剧种先后建立了实验示范性的剧院、剧团，有计划地开展普及和提高的工作。
    从建国初期起，在戏曲工作中就是正确贯彻执行了党的方针路线的。可是，由于有些同志对于方针领会的角度不同、深度不同，或者因袭了某些传统的错误观念，也曾产生过一些缺点、错误。因而贯彻方针的实践过程，也一直是对那些轻视传统，任意篡改的粗暴作风，企图一蹴而成的急躁情绪，和对遗产墨守成规，不肯改革的保守观念不断地说服和克服的过程。
    那时候，有些同志在戏曲改革中的反历史主义的倾向是比较突出的。用现代工人阶级思想去观察和描写历史，与把古代历史上的人物描写成现代工人阶级的思想，完全是两回事，前者是正确的，后者则是错误的。有的同志没有在理论和实践中加以严格区别。甚至借古代故事来阐述“社会发展史”，或使历史人物超出了一定的历史范畴，十分牵强地影射和比拟现代的斗争现实。当时在这方面所进行的严肃的批判，对于如何对待历史和历史题材的戏曲创作，起了提高的作用。
    同时，也通过讨论初步明确了神话与迷信的区别。无论是神话或迷信，本来都是反映了古代人民对于世界的一种幼稚的认识，一种对于超自然力量的信仰。但两者的意义却大为不同，其区别在于思想本质，不能专以貌取。神话虽也出于古代人民对自然现象的天真幻想，但是它反映了人们对社会不平的抗议或对理想世界的追求，最明显的特征是不肯屈服于命运，对于世界采取积极的态度；而迷信则与此相反，它是宣传因果报应的宿命论的观点，让人们安于天命，在命运面前低头，以维护统治阶级的利益。正确地对待神话和迷信，对于优秀的神话剧发挥了极大的保护作用。此外，对于如何理解人民性、如何理解政治和艺术的关系、如何正确理解生活的真实和艺术的真实，如何区别庸俗的色情和健康的爱情等问题，都进行了讨论，推动了戏曲剧目的正确发展。
    从第一次全国戏曲会演到1956年第一次全国戏曲剧目工作会议之间，戏曲艺术在党的领导之下，涌现了大量的优秀剧目，戏曲艺术有了蓬勃的发展；但也还存在着不平衡的情况。有些同志在具体实践中，对党的方针存在着模糊的认识。因而曾在戏曲批评方面发生过一些不是对具体剧目进行具体分析的简单粗暴的现象。与此同时，有些同志的保守思想也严重存在着，表现在十分迷恋过去，满足于前人或自己现有的某些成就，墨守成规，故步自封，对新的观点、新的创造不习惯，缺乏信心和热情。这对戏曲艺术的发展，也起着阻碍的作用。
    针对着以上的情况，文化部在1956年间召开了全国戏曲剧目工作会议，进行讨论解决。会议还强调提出，每个剧种必须整理、上演自己的优秀传统剧目，不应当只是去移植兄弟剧种的剧目。接着举办了多次戏曲演员讲习班和建立戏曲学院等学习机构，加强演员和其他艺术人员的艺术进修，请老艺人们示范演出，并较系统地整理了他们的艺术经验。
    艺术上的保守，往往是由于在认识上把传统艺术的规律僵化，看成是静止不变的东西；而粗暴又往往是由于在改革创造中没有精确地研究和掌握传统艺术的规律和特点，因而对于其中的精华部分缺乏正确认识而任意抛弃，损伤了原有的应该保持的特色。保守或粗暴态度，一般是由于认识模糊和经验不足而产生的，只不过是个别的、暂时的现象，通过同志式的批评和探讨，便逐步得到了纠正和提高。
    十年来，由于党的政策正确，和对于艺人亲切的关怀和教育，戏曲界的思想面貌发生了显著的变化，旧制度有了根本性的变革，这是贯彻党的方针的结果，又是继续贯彻党的方针的物质基础。
    十年来，艺人们在党的领导下逐步地克服旧思想、旧作风，建立新思想、新作风，从政治上、文化上、艺术上不断提高，进一步了解国家的政策，深入人民的生活和斗争，明确了为工农兵服务的方向。在1949年到1951年间，全国各省、市都先后举办了“戏曲演员讲习班”，艺人们初步理解了艺术和政治的关系，明确了戏曲艺术不仅仅是为了娱乐，重要的是在于教育人民。因而开始以慎重的态度来从事艺术创造。解放后的一系列的政治运动和民主改革，纯洁了戏曲队伍，推动了思想革命；特别是通过整风、反右派斗争，艺人们的政治思想觉悟显著地提高了。他们紧密地团结在党的周围，为祖国的社会主义建设热情地劳动，向又红又专的道路奋勇跃进。不少戏曲艺术家光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    十年来，古老而优秀的民族艺术传统得到了正确的继承和发展，艺术和艺术家们受到了真正的重视和尊重，老一辈的艺术家各安其所，人尽其才；新生一代像雨后春笋一般的人材辈出。全国每一个剧种，每一个剧团，每一个戏曲学校都绝无例外地涌现出不少的后起之秀，每一位老年或中年的艺人（包括演员和音乐工作者）都有了他的得意的继承者。由于在培养中坚决贯彻“全面发展，因材施教”的方针，使这些新人爱祖国、爱人民、爱党、爱社会主义、爱和平；他们的艺术，经过名师的精雕细刻，基础稳固；而且戏曲学校毕业的学生，都达到相当于高中的文化水平。
    戏曲改革的道路上并不是平坦无阻的，它同样存在着两条道路的尖锐斗争。大家都还记得，在戏曲改革工作中，曾经出现过两个巨灵挡路：一个是以反革命分子胡风为代表的民族虚无主义，胡风主张凡是“五四”以前的文艺都是“封建文艺”，因而把中国戏曲当成了他的死敌，采取全盘否定的态度。这个反动家伙百般叫嚣：谁要继承和发展民族戏曲传统，谁要执行“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，谁就是“旧活动家”、“国家主义者”、“民族复古主义者”。另一个则是以右派分子吴祖光、张伯驹为代表的国粹主义。他们对于戏曲遗产丝毫不加批判，完全是五体投地地拜倒。他们对封建糟粕和落后的东西抱有极大兴趣，甚至公开打出“保护国粹”的旗帜，抗拒党的政策方针；他们对于戏曲改革中任何一点进步，都表示极端的厌恶和仇恨。光彩夺目的戏曲改革运动在他们的眼里，是一团漆黑。这两股反动的浪头虽然出于同一根源——反党、反社会主义的封建阶级、资产阶级的反动思想。在形式上，却是以两种不同的面目，从不同的方面而出现的。在1955和1957年间，党进行了反胡风反革命集团和反右派的斗争，坚决粉碎了他们的进攻，更进一步提高了文艺界包括戏曲界的革命觉悟。单从戏曲工作的角度来看，这一场伟大的斗争，确实为戏曲艺术的发展，扫清了道路。
    经过反右派的斗争，戏曲界发生了更加深刻的变化，人们的思想觉悟普遍提高，革命热情大为高涨，接着像千军万马一般投入了大跃进的洪流，贯彻社会主义建设的总路线。通过争先恐后地上山、下乡、进厂、到部队送戏上门并进行劳动锻炼，加强与工农兵相结合，更深入地为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设服务。广大的戏曲工作者的政治觉悟，从而得到空前的提高。
    政治思想的提高，启发和鼓舞了群众的高度的创作热情，为社会主义而歌，为社会主义而舞，人人心花怒放，浑身是劲。全国戏曲剧院、剧团从大跃进以来，本着“两条腿走路”的精神，都在传统剧本的整理改编、新历史剧的创作，和表现现代题材新剧目的实验工作中，获得了很大的成绩。从1958年4月到今年国庆，整理、创作、上演的剧目差不多都数倍于往昔，有的单位超过过去同等时间内完成剧目数量的十倍以上。很多剧目的思想和艺术的质量也比过去大为丰富、提高，老一辈的艺术家青春常在，新生力量朝气蓬勃。形成了空前繁荣的新局面。今年全国戏曲界为庆祝建国十周年，百花献瑞，万紫千红，就是这一新局面的集中表现。
        红花花更红
    十年来的经验证明，党和毛主席提出的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针是完全正确的，非常伟大的。我国的戏曲艺术界在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，展开了旷古未有的红火热闹的群众运动，使我国古老的丰富多采的戏曲艺术从旧文艺的范畴大踏步地迈进了新文艺的范畴。
    十年来，我国文学艺术界所进行的无产阶级与资产阶级两条道路的斗争，它像一条红线贯穿着我国社会主义文学艺术的历史，戏曲改革工作当然也不能例外。这些斗争的性质，有属于敌我矛盾的，也有属于人民内部矛盾的，但都是阶级斗争的反映。在一个时期内，有些“好心”的人根本看不见阶级斗争在戏曲界的存在。当然，他们也许承认艺人和封建把头的阶级矛盾，但是问题并不止此，更深入的思想斗争是我国社会主义革命阶段中阶级斗争在意识形态上的反映。戏曲界反右派的斗争，粉碎了右派分子的进攻，同时也促使了一些好心的同志从睡梦中惊醒。
    党的“团结和教育相结合”的方针，将永远是戏曲界政治工作的重要依据。在戏曲界，绝大多数的同志是热爱党，热爱社会主义的，这就是团结的基础，但是从团结的愿望出发，达到更加团结前进的目的，在这之间，也还存在着一定的思想斗争的。主要是有时表现在无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的分歧。只要存在着原则分歧的时候，就不应模糊这种分歧。无论是自觉或不自觉地模糊了这种分歧，都是非常错误的。十年来，戏曲界的政治觉悟有了普遍的提高，这是不能抹煞的事实，但不能以此为满足，今后，加强马克思列宁主义的学习，深入工农兵，在劳动、工作和生活中同群众密切结合，锻炼改造，积极地克服资产阶级个人主义的名利思想，树立无产阶级集体主义思想，确立共产主义的世界观，是我们共同努力的目标。
    继续贯彻“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，还在于不断地克服戏曲界根深蒂固地存在着的一种传统的惰性和保守的力量，这种传统的惰性和保守力量往往自觉或不自觉地对于艺术的发展和新生一代的成长，起着消极的作用。
    十年来的事实证明，在艺术上正确地继承发展和新生力量的蓬勃成长，是一个剧种的生命力充沛与否的重要标志。因而，正确而大胆地创造革新和对于新生力量的支持和培养，就成为戏曲工作前进中的重要课题。在新人新事的面前，表现任何的怀疑、冷淡，甚或采取泼冷水的态度，都会对人民的戏曲事业发生有害的影响。
    十年来，不少剧种重视了新生力量的培养，显示了剧种的青春无限的未来。这主要是由于党的大力支持和正确领导，但和许多前辈艺人的悉心教导也是分不开的。在这方面有显著成绩的剧种，最突出的特点，是前辈艺术家培养新生一代的时候，不是个人主义的态度，而是从人民戏曲事业的利益出发，是把个人的利益和社会主义事业的利益统一起来看：新生力量的成长既使前辈的艺术得到继承，川流不息，又使本剧种青春焕发，前途无限。“新陈代谢”总是客观的规律。何况现在时代变了，制度变了，人和人的关系也发生了根本性的变化。新社会既尊重和重视老艺人，也重视新生力量的培养，这都是为了戏剧艺术的未来，为了更好地为人民服务。时代的列车在不断前进，我们应当作新鲜事物和新生力量的保护者和促进派，并且坚决地同那些压制和排斥新人新事的资产阶级思想和习惯势力进行坚决的斗争。
    十年来的经验证明，坚持政治挂帅，巩固党的领导，贯彻群众路线和为工农兵服务的方向，是戏曲工作的不可动摇的原则。大跃进以来，戏曲界也还有人对于在戏曲工作中贯彻党的建设社会主义的总路线，表示怀疑和动摇。可见戏曲界思想战线上并没有风平浪静，这是不能不引起我们严重警惕的。
    十年来的经验证明，党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的戏曲改革政策，是深入人心的无往不利的工作指针。从戏曲内容到艺术形式如何去芜存菁，是十分细致复杂的工作，必须严肃对待。另方面，新时代打破了各剧种之间相互隔离的藩篱，为剧种之间的相互学习，相互吸收养料，准备了充分的条件。这对于各剧种的共同提高有极好的作用。但是相互学习相互吸收的时候，也应该注意保持本剧种的特色。任何剧种之间，有着共同的规律，但是每个剧种本身，甚至每个剧目本身，也都有它自己的特殊的规律和特性。吸收兄弟剧种的东西，应该
  大胆，应该广为采集，但必须根据自己的规律和特点加以融化，化为己有。
    我国戏曲艺术之获得新生命，更在于从思想内容和艺术形式上，勇于进行“推陈出新”，正确地解决继承和发展的关系。既尊重和继承前人的成就，又发挥独创精神，善于学习，勤于实践，勇于创造，努力提高演出剧目的思想和艺术质量。不是一枝一叶的提高，而应是舞台艺术的全面提高。不要被前人的成就所吓住，不要躺在遗产上碌碌守成，要有雄心大志，从各方面超越前人。“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”，是社会发展的规律，也是艺术发展的规律。“推陈出新”的过程，同样是不断革命的过程。
    “推陈出新”的精神同样也表现在反映现代生活的剧目方面。全国各个剧种表现当代人民的生活斗争都创造了很好的成绩，甚至如昆曲、京剧等传统形式和新的内容之间存在着较大矛盾的古老剧种，也开始作了比较成功的尝试，这是应该继续努力的。无论历史剧目或现代剧目都是人民所需要的，在比例上或重或轻，或多或少，或先或后，或急或缓，要取决于每个剧种或每个剧团的实际条件。例如昆曲、京剧等古老剧种，现代剧目的比重就不宜太大，因为它的固有形式更擅长于表现历史生活题材。而且表现现代生活题材还有一个摸索和实验的过程，因此应以少而精的原则，坚持试验，不断地积累经验；并继续整理、改编和创作历史剧目，展其所长。因为过去、现在即使更久远的将来，这些传统剧目或者新的历史剧目仍然是为广大人民所需要所欢迎的。
    在政治挂帅的前提下，我们应该坚定不移地继续贯彻“百花齐放，推陈出新”、“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，大力提倡题材、风格和形式的多样化，提倡学术上的自由辩论和不同的艺术流派的自由竞赛，从而调动一切戏曲工作者的积极力量，来发展和繁荣社会主义时代的新戏曲。同时，要特别重视演出剧目的思想性、时代精神，并力求艺术的精美完整，充分运用技术条件，增强艺术表现和感染的力量，使我国戏曲艺术达到无愧于伟大时代所要求的水平。
    革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，除了着重正确地表现社会主义、共产主义时代的内容之外，它对于民主革命时期一直上溯到历代的生活题材都应该是适用的。处理历史题材运用这一创作方法的基础，就是马克思列宁主义的历史观点和美学观点。使我们所处理的历史事件和人物形象，在艺术表现上既在一定的历史范围之内，又比原来生活更高、更集中、更强烈、更典型、更和今天的观众密切精神联系，发挥积极的影响，作到“古为今用”。
    十年来，我国戏曲艺术事业的成就是巨大的，但是比起工农业生产发展的速度和整个祖国建设的辉煌成就，只不过是“沧海一粟”。人民群众文化生活需要的日益增长，要求我们百倍努力。我们的祖国，有如此古老的优秀的艺术传统，有如此壮大的向上的艺术队伍，必将攀登世界先进艺术的高峰。
