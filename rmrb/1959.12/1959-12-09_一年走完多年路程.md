Completing Many Years of Journey in One Year

    The sixteen new specialties of the Harbin Institute of Technology, such as optical instruments, radio, and engineering physics, cooperate and promote each other with the original specialties, playing an increasingly significant role in jointly improving the school's teaching level and scientific research level.

    These sixteen specialties were all newly established during the Great Leap Forward last year. In the past year, they have completed a journey that would have taken several years to complete according to "convention." For example, the optical instrument specialty, which was established in October last year, has offered thirteen experiments in professional courses such as applied optics, glass technology, and practical optics, and wrote textbooks for two courses in less than a year, and the students were satisfied with the quality of the lectures and teaching materials. The various specialties of the newly established Radio Department have not only quickly offered four or five professional courses, but the teachers and students have also successfully trial-produced a one-kilowatt television central equipment.

    一年走完多年路程
    哈尔滨工业大学新建的光学仪器、无线电、工程物理学等十六个专业，同原来的专业互相配合、互相促进，在共同提高学校的教学水平和科学研究水平方面起着日益显著的作用。
    这十六个专业，都是在去年大跃进中新建的。它们一年来走完了按“常规”需要好几年才能走完的路程。例如去年10月才建立的光学仪器专业，不到一年就开出了应用光学、玻璃工艺、实用光学等专业课和实用光学等课程的十三个实验，写出了两门课的讲义，并且在讲课和教材质量上使学生感到满意。新建的无线电系各个专业，不但很快开出了四、五门专业课，而且师生们还试制成功了功率为一瓩的电视中心设备。　（据新华社讯）
