    Fitter's Tool Machine
    Liu Yaoli
    This summer, at the national mechanical system indigenous equipment and indigenous methods skills competition held in Beijing, a fitter's tool machine appeared. It could perform eleven kinds of tasks: scraping, drilling, reaming, tapping, filing, sawing, grinding, polishing, screwing, and milling small grooves. It opened a path for fitters to change from manual operation to mechanical operation and was awarded first prize at the conference. The creator of this tool machine is Zhong Zuyin, a twenty-seven-year-old Communist Party member and a fourth-grade fitter with only three years of schooling from the Changsha Machine Tool Factory.
    Speaking of creating this tool machine, there was a struggle involved.
    In 1958, the Party Committee of the Changsha Machine Tool Factory mobilized all the factory's employees to vigorously engage in technical innovation. Many experienced masters and engineering technicians, in order to change the tiring and slow manual scraping to mechanization, started to trial-produce scraping machines. After a long period of trial production, none were successful. Some people were stymied and abandoned the idea of trial production. At this time, fitter Zhong Zuyin stepped forward and boldly proposed the request to trial-produce a scraping machine. This news spread throughout the entire workshop. Some people said he was a "reckless fellow" and "a toad yawning, with a big mouth." However, the Party organization and some other comrades enthusiastically encouraged him. Workers Tan Bingnan and technician Wang Jianzhong immediately actively helped him with ideas. In fact, Zhong Zuyin knew that this was an arduous task, but for the sake of socialist construction and to realize the ideal of fitter mechanization, he was determined to do so.
    He learned, designed, and improved simultaneously. After more than a month of effort, he made a scraping machine, but because the scraping force was too small, it was unusable.
    One sunny Sunday, Zhong Zuyin went to the city of Changsha.
    "Boom, boom boom, boom boom boom!" The deafening engine sound caught his attention. A car was climbing up a hillside. He carefully observed that the engine was turning very fast, but the wheels were turning very slowly. The car's horsepower was increased, prompting the car to slowly climb the ridge. He immediately thought: If a motor and mechanical transmission were installed on the scraping machine, wouldn't it also increase the scraping force of the scraping machine? He immediately rushed back to the factory and designed a bevel gear transmission scheme that same day. Comrade Fu Shengyuan, the Party Secretary, was very happy to see this scheme and handed the drawings over to the machining workshop to be produced immediately. However, when it was installed and tested on the third day, although the scraping force was increased, it was still too small to be used. He thought: If the motor of the scraping machine could change speed, wouldn't it increase the scraping force? But he didn't understand motor knowledge, so he asked electrical engineer Jin Hanqing and electrician master Li Zhu for help. They helped him convert the original motor into a six-speed motor, and the scraping force was further increased, but it was still insufficient. Zhong Zuyin conducted more than ten more tests, but still failed. At this time, many people felt that the hope of success was getting smaller and smaller. Some people advised him to "call it quits" as soon as possible. At this critical juncture, Zhong Zuyin did not waver. He regarded every difficulty and every failure as a test of his revolutionary will. Late at night, he was still studying technical books and racking his brains. Finally, in subsequent experiments, he discovered that after the motor speed increased, the stiffness of the flexible shaft was insufficient, and the flexible shaft had to be changed to a square shaft. This required the square shaft joint and the eccentric wheel to be butt-welded together using "flash welding." He didn't understand welding at all, and no one in the factory could master "flash welding." Therefore, he had to study the section on contact welding in the Soviet-published translation of "Electro-Machining." To study this type of college course was so difficult for an ordinary worker who had only attended elementary school for three years! At first, he read it more than twenty times in a row, but he couldn't understand what was going on. He was stumped by technical terms such as "primary current," "secondary current," and "resistance coefficient." So he asked workers and engineering technicians with higher levels of education to teach him word by word, and he also looked for some popular electrical, physical, and chemical books for reference, and gradually experimented. In this way, learning and doing simultaneously, he studied a total of forty or fifty times before he understood the basic knowledge of flash welding, broke through the final obstacle, and successfully trial-produced the scraping machine.
    After that, he installed an electric drill, grinding head, tap, and tapping tool on the scraping machine. After his continuous improvements, this machine tool, weighing less than sixty kilograms, could not only perform scraping, drilling, reaming, and tapping operations, but also perform eleven processes such as filing, grinding, polishing, and milling small holes, becoming a light and flexible fitter's tool machine.

    年轻人的创造
    钳工的工具机
    刘耀黎
    今年夏天，在北京举行的全国机械系统土设备、土办法的比武大会上，出现了一部钳工工具机，能干十一种活：刮研、钻孔、绞孔、攻丝、锉、锯、磨、抛光、拧螺丝、铣小槽等，为钳工由手工操作改为机械操作打开了一条门路，被大会评为一等奖。创造这部工具机的，是长沙机床厂二十七岁的共产党员、仅读了三年书的四级钳工钟祖荫。
    说起创造这部工具机，却有一番斗争过程。
    在1958年，长沙机床厂党委动员全厂职工大闹技术革新，不少老师傅、工程技术人员，为了把又累又慢的手工刮研改成机械化，纷纷动手试制刮研机。经过一个较长时间的试制，都没有成功，有些人碰了钉子，把试制念头就打消了。这时，钳工钟祖荫挺身而出，大胆地提出试制刮研机的要求，这个消息一下就传遍了整个车间，有人说他是“冒失鬼”，是“癞头哈蟆打呵欠，口气大”，可是党组织和另外一些同志都热情地鼓励他。工人谭炳南、技术员王建中马上积极帮他出主意。其实，钟祖荫何尝不知道这是一件艰巨的工作，但为了社会主义建设，为了实现钳工机械化的理想，他毅然决然地要这样做。
    他边学习、边设计、边改进，经过一个多月的努力，做成了一部刮研机，可是由于刮削力量太小，根本不能使用。
    一个晴朗的星期天，钟祖荫到长沙市区去。
    “轰，轰轰，轰轰轰！”震耳的引擎声，引起了他的注意。一辆汽车正向山坡上爬行，他仔细一观察，发现引擎转得很快，车轮却转得很慢，汽车马力加大了，促使汽车慢慢爬上岭，他马上联想到：在刮研机上装上一个马达和机械变速器，不是也能提高刮研机的刮削力量吗？他马上赶回厂里，当天便设计成了一个伞齿轮变速的方案。党委书记傅声远同志看到这个方案非常高兴，将图纸交给加工车间立即赶制出来。可是第三天装好后试验时，刮削的力量虽然加大了，可是力量还是太小，不能使用。他想：刮研机的马达如能变速，不就可以增加刮削力量吗？但他不懂电机知识，便去请教电器工程师金汉卿，电工李柱老师傅，他们帮他把原来的马达改装成一个六级变速马达，刮削力量进一步增大了，不过还是不足。钟祖荫又进行了十多次的试验，仍然遭到了失败，这时不少人觉得成功的希望越来越小了。有些人劝他说“早收场”算了。在这紧要的关头，钟祖荫没有动摇，他对于每一个困难，每一次失败，都看成是对自己革命意志的考验。到深夜，他还在学习技术书籍，苦思苦想。终于，在以后的试验中，他发现在马达转速加快以后，软轴的刚度不够，必需把软轴改为方轴。这就要把方轴接头和偏心轮用“闪光焊”对焊起来。他根本不懂焊接，厂里也没有人能掌握“闪光焊”，于是，他又不得不学习苏联出版的“电加工学”译本中关于接触焊部分。要学习这种高等学校的课程，这对于一个只念过三年小学的普通工人说来，是多么不容易的啊！开始时，他连续看了二十多遍，也领会不了究竟是怎么一回事，单是“一次电流”、“二次电流”、“电阻系数”等技术名词，就把它顶住了，于是他请文化水平高的工人和工程技术人员教他一字一句地学习，还找些通俗的电器、物理、化学书籍作参考，并且一面逐步试验。就这样边学边做，先后共学习了四、五十遍才学懂了闪光焊的基本知识，突破了最后一道难关，将刮研机试制成功了。
    以后，他又在刮研机上装置电钻、磨头、丝锥、攻丝，经过他的不断改进，这个不到六十公斤的机床，不仅能够进行刮研、钻孔、绞孔、攻丝等操作，而且还可以从事锉、磨、抛光、铣小孔等十一道工序，成了一个轻巧灵活的钳工工具机了。
