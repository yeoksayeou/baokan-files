    Pigs Fertilize Fields, Fields Feed Pigs
      Tang Zongdao
    A large herd of fat pigs,
    Each one like a calf;
    Collective raising is good,
    Caring for them meticulously,
    The commune's pig farmer,
    Brags to everyone:
    "Just reported the numbers yesterday,
    New pigs added today;
    Thin pigs become fat pigs,
    Fat pigs full of meat.
    Pigs fertilize fields, fields feed pigs,
    One pig per mu of land,
    Both grain and meat,
    The commune is getting richer and richer."

    猪养田　田养猪
      唐宗祷
    肥猪一大群，
    个个赛牛犊；
    集体饲养好，
    精心来招呼，
    公社饲养员，
    逢人便夸说：
    “昨天才报数，
    今天增新猪；
    瘦猪变肥猪，
    胖猪一身肉。
    猪养田，田养猪，
    一亩田地一头猪，
    又有粮来又有肉，
    公社越来越富足。”
