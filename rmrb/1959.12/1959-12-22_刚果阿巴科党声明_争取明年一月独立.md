　　ABAKO Party of the Congo Declares
    Strive for Independence in January Next Year

    Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 19th: The ABAKO party of the Belgian Congo issued a statement on the 18th saying, "We are determined to sacrifice everything in order to achieve independence in January 1960."

    The statement announced that the party will not recognize the authority of the Belgian colonial authorities after the end of this year. The statement said that the Belgian authorities' administrative power over the ABAKO tribe in Lower Congo will cease on the night of December 31st.

    This statement was issued when King Baudouin of Belgium began his inspection of the Congo. It was published in the party's publication "Our Congo." The Belgian colonial police confiscated this issue. In its statement, the ABAKO party demanded that elections be organized in the Congo to give the Congolese people "the opportunity to freely choose their own leaders."

    The party stated that if the Belgian authorities abandon their so-called timetable for granting "independence" to the Congo, the party is still prepared to participate in a round table conference with the Belgians on the political future of the Congo. The ABAKO party statement rejects a "Belgian-Congolese community."

    In its statement, the ABAKO party called on its members to be vigilant and guard against the repression of the colonial authorities before and after the deceptive "local elections" that the Belgian authorities are to hold in the Congo. The statement demanded that if the party's leaders are arrested, members should abandon their property and take their wives and children to become prisoners.

　　刚果阿巴科党声明
    争取明年一月独立
    据新华社19日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比属刚果阿巴科党18日发表声明说，“我们决心牺牲一切以便在1960年1月获得独立。”
    声明宣布这个党在今年年底以后就不承认比利时殖民当局的权力。声明说，比利时当局对下刚果的阿巴科部族的行政权到12月31日晚就停止了。
    这篇声明是在比利时国王博杜安开始在刚果巡视的时候发表的。它登载在这个党的刊物“我们的刚果”上。比利时殖民警察没收了这期刊物。阿巴科党在声明中要求在刚果组织让刚果人民“有机会自由选择自己领袖”的选举。
    这个党表示，如果比利时当局抛开它所谓给刚果“独立”的时间表的话，这个党仍然准备参加同比利时人举行的关于刚果政治前途的圆桌会议。阿巴科党声明拒绝“比利时—刚果共同体”。
    阿巴科党在声明中号召党员在比利时当局要在刚果举行欺骗性的“地方选举”的前后，提高警惕，防备殖民当局的镇压。声明要求党员们，如果这个党的领袖被捕，就抛弃财产，带着妻子和小孩去做囚人。
