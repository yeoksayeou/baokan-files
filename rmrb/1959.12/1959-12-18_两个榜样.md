Two Exemplary Models

The Xingxian Baijiagou Management District and the Luzhou Special District Horticultural Science Research Institute pig farm are two good examples of preventing swine fever. Their most valuable experience is the conscientious implementation of the principle of "prevention is more important than cure" in many aspects.

First, they emphasize self-breeding and self-raising, and choose good breeds of pigs to raise, which avoids the spread of diseases from other places.
Second, they use many simple and easy-to-implement methods to enhance the disease resistance of pigs.
Third, rational feeding management ensures that every pig has a regular life. In this way, they have achieved remarkable results of not losing a single pig and not getting a single pig sick for many years.

Collective raising has created extremely favorable conditions for preventing and ultimately eliminating swine fever. We should make full use of this favorable condition. Let go and develop the collective pig raising business. (Attached pictures)

    两个榜样
    兴县白家沟管理区和泸州专区园艺科学研究所养猪场是防止猪疫的两个好榜样。他们最宝贵的经验，就是从多方面认真贯彻了“防重于治”的方针。
    第一，他们强调自繁自育，选择良种猪饲养，这就避免了外地病疫的传播。
  第二，他们使用许多简单易行的办法来增强猪只的抗病能力。
    第三，饲养管理合理化，使头头猪只生活有规律。这样，他们就做出了多年不死一头猪、不病一头猪的显著成绩。
    集体饲养为防治猪疫并进而消灭猪疫创造了极为有利的条件。我们应该充分运用这个有利条件。放手发展集体养猪事业。（附图片）
