    How to Preserve Cabbage in Cellars

    The management of Chinese cabbage during storage should adopt different management methods according to the seasonal temperature changes.

    Early storage period (from the Beginning of Winter to the Major Snow): Since the cabbage has just been put into the cellar, the respiration of the cabbage is relatively strong, and the weather is not too cold. The temperature and humidity in the cellar are relatively high, so a large amount of ventilation should be carried out. In the case where the Chinese cabbage will not be frozen, the skylights and vents should be fully opened day and night. During this period, turn the cabbage every three to five days. Each time the cabbage is turned, remove the yellow ribs and rotten leaves, and pick out the white cabbage that cannot be stored for advance processing.

    Mid-storage period (from the Major Snow to the Beginning of Spring): This is the coldest period of the year, and special attention should be paid to cold protection and insulation. Starting from the Major Snow, the vents on the cabbage cellar should be gradually blocked. First block the windward side, and then block the leeward side. The reed mats (or straw curtains) on the skylight should be rolled up and covered tightly in time according to the weather changes and the temperature inside the cellar. During the coldest "three nine days," if covering one layer of straw curtain is not enough to keep warm, add another layer. However, while keeping warm, the moisture in the cellar should be removed in time, but the ventilation window should be small and the ventilation time should be short. During this period, the respiration of the cabbage is very weak, and the temperature inside the cabbage pile is not easy to increase. Therefore, the time for turning the cabbage can be extended to ten to fifteen days. Slightly frozen cabbage can be turned immediately, and the ventilation time can be shorter, which can restore its original state.

    Late storage period (from the Beginning of Spring to the Qingming Festival): The weather gradually warms up, the cellar temperature rises, and the humidity also increases. Therefore, the management during this period should pay attention to lowering the cellar temperature. In order to reduce the inflow of hot air into the cabbage cellar, during the day, gradually cover the mats from noon to all day. At night, gradually open the skylights from half-covering to fully opening them for ventilation. The vents on the shady side can be gradually opened completely. During this period, turn the cabbage frequently, once every five or six days, otherwise it will easily rot. In addition, pay attention to the management of special weather: on windy days, roll up the mats on the windward side for ventilation to prevent cold air from directly attacking; on windy days, cover the mats tightly; on foggy days, ventilate later; on snowy days, clean the snow on the roof of the cellar in time; on rainy days, cover the mats. When it is not possible to roll up the mats on rainy or snowy days, a small shed can be set up on one side of the mat for ventilation.

    怎样保管窖藏白菜
    大白菜贮藏期间的管理，要根据季节温度的变化，采取不同的管理方法。
    贮藏初期（立冬后到大雪前）：由于白菜入窖不久，菜的呼吸较强，同时天气不太冷，窖内温度和湿度都比较高，所以应该大量通风换气，在大白菜不致受冻的情况下，天窗和气眼昼夜都要全部开放。这一时期每隔三五天翻菜一次，每次倒菜时要去掉黄帮烂叶，挑出颜色白不能存放的菜提前处理。
    贮藏中期（大雪后到立春前）：这时期气候最冷，要特别注意防寒保温。从大雪起，要陆续把菜窖上的气眼堵上，先堵迎风面，随后再堵背风面，天窗上的蒲席（或草帘子）要根据天气的变化和窖内的温度及时卷开和盖严。在最冷的“三九天”，如果盖一层草帘子还不能保温时，要多盖一层。但在保温的同时，还要及时排除窖内的湿气，不过换气的窗口要小，放气的时间要短。这一时期菜的呼吸作用很弱，菜堆内温度也不易增高，因此倒菜的时间可以拉长到十到十五天一次。受到轻微的冻菜，可以立即倒菜，换气时间小一点，能够恢复原状。
    贮藏后期（立春后到清明前）：天气逐渐转暖，窖温上升，湿气也大，因此这一时期的管理要注意降低窖温；为了减少热空气流入菜窖，白天要逐渐由中午盖席到全天盖席，夜间也是逐步由盖半席到全部敞开天窗放风，阴面的气眼可以陆续全部打开。这一时期要勤倒菜，每隔五六天倒一次，否则容易腐烂。另外，还要注意特殊天气的管理：刮风天要迎风卷席放风，防止冷空气直接袭击；大风天要盖严席；下雾天要晚换气；下雪天要及时打扫窖顶的积雪；下雨天要盖席。雨天、雪天不能卷席时，可在席的一边支起小窝棚放风。
