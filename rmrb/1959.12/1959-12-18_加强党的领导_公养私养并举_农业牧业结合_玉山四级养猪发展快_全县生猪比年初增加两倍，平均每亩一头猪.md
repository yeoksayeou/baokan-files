(Dispatch from Nanchang, December 17) Jiangxi Province has raised a red-flag county for pig raising. Yushan County in Jiangxi Province has conscientiously implemented the policy of combining public and private raising, with public raising as the mainstay, enabling hog production to develop at a high speed. The entire county has achieved one pig per mu of land. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has called on all parts of the province to earnestly study and promote Yushan County's experience in developing hog production at a high speed, and to vigorously develop animal husbandry production centered on pig raising.

Hog production is the second most important production in Yushan County, second only to agriculture; in previous years, the income from this production accounted for more than 40% of the total agricultural income. This year, Yushan County has developed pig raising to more than 350,000 heads, an increase of two times compared with the beginning of the year, and an increase of 17 and a half times compared with the early days of liberation; the county averages 5.4 pigs per household, 1.28 pigs per person, and one pig per mu of land. Among them, collectively raised pigs account for more than 70%.

More pigs mean more fertilizer, which promotes agricultural production. This year, the county's pig raising has accumulated 8 million dan of high-quality fertilizer, an average of 23 dan per mu, more than double that of last year. The county's total grain output this year increased by 20% compared with last year, transforming it from a historically grain-deficient county to a surplus-grain county.

With the development of hog production, the income of the broad masses of commune members has greatly increased. The county's income from pig raising this year has reached more than 5 million yuan, an average of nearly 80 yuan per household. This amount is equal to twice the total income from agricultural and sideline occupations in the agricultural cooperative period.

The main reason for the high-speed development of hog production in Yushan County is that Party committees at all levels have resolutely implemented the policy of combining public and private raising, with public raising as the mainstay. The county has adopted a four-level management method of communes, brigades, production teams, and commune member households, with the development of collective pig raising as the main focus and the development of commune member household pig raising as a supplement, fully mobilizing the pig-raising enthusiasm of all levels of the entire commune. The method of developing collective pig raising is to give full play to the strength of the people's communes and use the "small indigenous groups" method to run pig farms on a large scale. Small means that the scale of the farms is not large, generally each farm raises 100-200 pigs; indigenous means adopting the method of "three substitutions" (using miscellaneous wood to replace cedar wood, earthen walls to replace brick walls, and straw to replace tiles) and "one utilization" (utilizing old houses and temples), making do with whatever is available, using local materials, and building economical and practical farmhouses; groups means relying on the masses to run farms.

Strengthening Party leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the high-speed development of pig raising. To this end, the Yushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China established a Livestock Production Headquarters, with the first secretary of the county Party committee personally taking charge, and a fixed secretary specifically in charge of hog production; communes, brigades, and production teams at all levels established livestock production headquarters or leading groups, with a secretary or commune director/team leader specifically responsible. Party committees at all levels, like grasping agriculture, regularly study, deploy, and inspect hog production, and promptly solve problems existing in production. At the same time, Party committees at all levels used methods such as holding on-site meetings, organizing competitions and evaluations, and engaging in "pig raising experimental fields" to create, summarize, and promote advanced pig raising experiences, driving the overall situation and accelerating the development of hogs throughout the county.

In vigorously developing the pig raising industry, Yushan County has implemented the principle of integrating agriculture and animal husbandry, implementing the construction of farms in "坞坞 (wuwu - village unit)" and fertilizer production along the fields, combining the establishment of pig farms with the transformation of low-yield fields. This is a multi-benefit method: it not only manufactures a large amount of high-quality fertilizer for distant and poor fields, but also saves labor for transporting fertilizer; it not only makes it easier to solve pig feed but also finds a place for livestock grazing. Party committees at all levels in Yushan County have always adhered to the principle of "self-breeding and self-raising" to solve the problem of livestock sources. The main methods are: 1. Establish breeding pig farms, select excellent purebred pigs to cultivate breeding pigs. At present, more than 200 breeding pig farms have been established in the county, raising 32,000 breeding pigs, which are the livestock source base for the entire county. 2. Promote the "one sow production system." 3. Promote the "double mating," "multiple mating," "multiple births," and artificial insemination breeding methods to increase the conception rate of sows.

This year, Yushan County adopted the approach of "preparing for the off-season during the peak season, preparing for next year this year," grasping the four aspects of "planting," "collecting," "storing," and "processing," and implementing feed work throughout the year, basically solving the feed problem. Last winter, when the county Party committee arranged the planting plan, considering the needs of hog development this year, it expanded the planting area of ​​sweet potatoes, corn, and other crops. This summer, it launched a mass movement of "seizing every opportunity and vigorously engaging in feed." One-tenth of an acre of private plots per pig were planted with green feed; newly reclaimed wasteland and idle land along the roadsides were planted with pumpkins and corn. At the same time, tens of thousands of women and children rushed to the fields, mountains, and forests to collect more than 200 kinds of wild feed, totaling more than 52 million jin. During the autumn harvest, the broad masses of cadres and the masses launched a movement to "grasp utilization and grasp silage," and in a very short period of time, the collective silage alone amounted to approximately 2,700 cellars and more than 80 million jin, enough for the existing hogs' "rations" for half a year.

In order to strengthen pig raising management, this year, all communes in the county rectified the newly built pig farms, enriched them with new backbones, and formed a strong professional team for livestock production. Among them, the county Party committee specially summarized and promoted the advanced experience of the Qunli Commune in creating "the whole family entering the farm and taking the farm as their home." This experience was welcomed by the broad masses and brought a new atmosphere to the operation and management of the pig farms. The whole family enters the farm, and the whole family can play a role: men plant feed, women raise pigs, old people take care of children, and young people graze cattle. While promoting this experience, the responsibility system and distribution method of "proportional profit sharing and fixed quota rewards" were also fully implemented, increasing the enthusiasm of the breeders.

In terms of epidemic prevention, at the beginning of this year, the county Party committee put forward the slogan "grasp development with one hand and epidemic prevention with the other," leading the masses to carry out epidemic prevention work, and adopted a series of specific measures. Therefore, the county basically eliminated infectious diseases such as swine erysipelas, swine fever, and hog cholera this year, ensuring the healthy development of hogs.

On the basis of achieving great success in developing hog production, Yushan County is making persistent efforts and advancing victoriously. The county Party committee plans to raise 700,000 pigs next year and break through the one million mark in three years. At present, the county's Communist Party members and the broad masses of cadres and the masses have launched a surging new upsurge of pig raising centered on building farms and mating.

    江西竖起一面养猪红旗县
    加强党的领导　公养私养并举　农业牧业结合
    玉山四级养猪发展快
    全县生猪比年初增加两倍，平均每亩一头猪
    本报南昌17日电　江西玉山县认真贯彻公私并举、公养为主的方针，使生猪生产得到了高速度发展，全县实现了一亩田一头猪。中共江西省委号召全省各地认真学习和推广玉山县高速度发展生猪生产的经验，大力发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产。
  生猪生产是玉山县仅次于农业的一项主要生产；历年这项生产收入占农业总收入的40％以上。今年，玉山县养猪已发展到三十五万余头，比年初增加了两倍，比解放初期增加了十七倍半；全县平均每户养猪五点四头，每人养猪一点二八头，每亩田有猪一头。其中，集体饲养的占70％以上。
    猪多肥多，促进了农业生产。今年全县养猪积造优质肥料达八百万担，平均每亩田二十三担，比去年增加两倍多。全县今年粮食总产量比去年增长20％，由历史上缺粮一跃变成余粮县。
    随着生猪生产发展，广大社员的收入大大增加。全县今年养猪收入已达五百多万元，平均每户收入近八十元。这个数目等于农业社时期全年农副业总收入的两倍。
    玉山县生猪生产高速度发展，主要的原因是各级党委坚决贯彻了公私并举、公养为主的方针。该县采取公社、大队、生产队和社员家庭四级经营的办法，以发展集体养猪为主，发展社员家庭养猪为辅，充分调动了全社各级的养猪积极性。发展集体养猪的办法是，充分发挥人民公社的力量，运用“小土群”的方法大办养猪场。小，是场的规模不够大，一般每个场养猪一、二百头；土，是采取“三代”（杂木代杉木、土墙代砖墙、稻草代盖瓦）“一利用”（利用旧房屋、庙宇）的办法，因陋就简，就地取材，建设经济适用的场房；群，是依靠群众办场。
    加强党的领导，是高速度发展养猪的根本保证，为此，中共玉山县委成立了畜牧业生产指挥部，县委第一书记亲自挂帅，并固定一个书记专门抓生猪生产；公社、大队和生产队逐级建立畜牧业生产指挥所或指挥小组，有一名书记或社长、队长具体负责。各级党委如同抓农业一样，定期研究、布置、检查生猪生产，及时解决生产中存在的问题。同时，各级党委运用开现场会、组织竞赛和评比检查，搞“养猪试验田”等方法，创造、总结了推广养猪先进经验，带动全面，加速全县生猪的发展。
    在大力发展养猪事业中，玉山县贯彻执行了农牧结合的原则，实行了坞坞建场、田边造肥，把建立养猪场和改造低产田结合了起来。这是一举多得的办法：不仅为远田瘦田制造了大量的优质肥料，而且节省了运肥的劳动力；不仅使养猪饲料容易解决而且找到了牲畜放牧的场所。玉山县各级党委始终坚持“自繁自养”的方针，解决了畜源问题。主要办法有：一、建立种猪繁殖场，选择优良的纯种猪培养种猪。目前全县建立了二百多个种猪场，饲养的种猪达三万二千头，是全县的畜源基地。二、推行“一产母猪制”。三、推广“双配”、“多配”、“多产”和人工授精的繁殖方法，提高母猪的受胎率。
    今年玉山县采取了“旺季备淡季，今年备来年”，抓住“种”、“采”、“贮”、“加工”四个方面，把饲料工作贯彻全年，基本上解决了饲料问题。去年冬季，县委在安排播种计划时，考虑到今年生猪发展的需要便扩大了红薯、玉米等作物播种面积。今年夏季时，又掀起了一个“见缝插针、大搞饲料”的群众运动。一头猪一分地的自留地，种上了青饲料；新开垦的荒地路旁闲田都种上了南瓜、玉米。与此同时，成千上万妇女儿童奔向田野、山林采集野生饲料二百多种达五千二百多万斤。秋收期间，广大干部群众又掀起了一个“抓利用抓青贮”的运动，在一个很短的时期内，光集体青贮的饲料约有二千七百多窖、八千多万斤，足够现有生猪半年的“口粮”。
    为了加强养猪管理，今年全县各公社对新建的养猪场进行了一次整顿，充实了新的骨干，组成了一支坚强的畜牧业生产专业队伍。其中，县委特地总结并推广了群力公社创造的“全家进场、以场为家”的先进经验。这条经验受到了广大群众的欢迎，给养猪场的经营管理工作带来了新气象。全家进场、一家大小都能发挥作用：男种饲料女养猪，老带娃娃少放牛。在推广这个经验的同时，还全面推行了“比例分红、定额奖励”的责任制和分配办法，提高了饲养员的积极性。
    在防疫方面，今年一开始，县委就提出了“一手抓发展，一手抓防疫”的口号，领导群众开展防疫工作，并采取了一系列的具体措施。因此，全县今年基本上消灭了猪丹毒、猪肺疫、猪瘟等传染病，保证了生猪的健康发展。
    在发展生猪生产取得巨大成绩的基础上，玉山县再接再厉，乘胜前进。县委计划明年养猪七十万头，三年突破百万大关。目前，全县共产党员和广大干部群众已掀起了一个以建场、配种为中心的汹涌澎湃的养猪新高潮。
