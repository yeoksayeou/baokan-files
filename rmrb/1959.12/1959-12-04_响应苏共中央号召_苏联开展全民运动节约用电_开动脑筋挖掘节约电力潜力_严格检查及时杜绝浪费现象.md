Xinhua News Agency, Moscow - The working people throughout the Soviet Union are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and have launched a national movement to use electricity rationally and save electricity.

The CPSU Central Committee recently published an open letter to Party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in all regions, as well as to all working people, calling on the entire country to save electricity and demanding that the rational use of electricity in all sectors of the national economy and in civilian applications be regarded as a task of national significance. The letter stated that the most important condition for completing the Seven-Year Plan is continuous technological progress, and the foundation of technological progress is the electrification of the national economy. Without more extensive electrification, it will be impossible to further realize comprehensive mechanization and automation, and it will be impossible to greatly increase labor productivity. After the CPSU Central Committee issued this call, enterprises and institutions throughout the Soviet Union took action to tap the potential in this area.

Enterprises under the Moscow Railway have always attached importance to saving electricity. After discussing the open letter from the CPSU Central Committee, the employees of these enterprises further used their brains to explore the potential for saving electricity. For example, electric locomotive workers on the Moscow-Yaroslavl railway section discovered that electric trains consume 70 kilowatt-hours of electricity each time they stop at a station. Therefore, they are working with dispatchers to study how to shorten the stopping time.

Metallurgical machinery manufacturing enterprises and chemical industry enterprises in the Tashkent Economic Zone have decided to renovate their electrical equipment in order to use electricity more rationally. The Heavy Industry Administration of the economic zone is drafting new standards for electricity consumption per unit of product. Some workshops of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine put forward many ways to eliminate electricity waste when discussing the open letter from the CPSU Central Committee, and suggested launching a competition to save electricity. Electricians at the Ulyanovsk "Contactor" factory have already saved 70,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first three quarters of this year. After reading the letter from the CPSU Central Committee, they decided to replace some energy-intensive production equipment with less energy-intensive equipment and install automatic temperature measuring devices to automatically control electricity consumption in order to further save electricity.

Members of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League have always been vanguards in various conservation movements in the Soviet Union. This time, they are not lagging behind either. They have established surprise inspection posts or work teams to strictly inspect the use of electricity in enterprises, institutions, and collective farms in production and daily life, and promptly eliminate wasteful electricity practices.

    响应苏共中央号召
    苏联开展全民运动节约用电
    开动脑筋挖掘节约电力潜力
    严格检查及时杜绝浪费现象
    据新华社莫斯科讯　苏联全国各地劳动人民热烈响应苏联共产党中央委员会的号召，展开了合理使用电力和节约用电的全民运动。
    苏共中央最近发表了给各地党、苏维埃、工会、共青团组织和全体劳动人民的公开信，号召全国节约电力，并要求把在国民经济各部门和民用方面合理地使用电力看成为具有全国重大意义的任务。信中说，完成七年计划的最重要条件，是不断的技术进步，而技术进步的基础就是国民经济的电气化。没有更加广泛的电气化，就无法进一步实现全盘机械化和自动化，就无法大大提高劳动生产率。苏共中央的这一号召发出以后，苏联各地企业和机关纷纷行动起来，挖掘这方面的潜力。
    莫斯科铁路所属各企业过去一直重视节约用电。在讨论了苏共中央的公开信以后，这些企业的职工又进一步开动脑筋，挖掘节约电力的潜力。例如，莫斯科—雅罗斯拉夫铁路段电气机车工人们发现，电气列车每停一站要耗费七十度电力，因此，他们正在和调度员研究如何缩短停车时间的问题。
    塔什干经济区的冶金机器制造工业企业和化学工业企业决定要改建电力设备以便更合理地用电，经济区的重工业管理局正在拟订生产每一单位产品的耗电新标准。马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂的一些车间在讨论苏共中央的公开信时提出了许多杜绝电力浪费的办法，并建议展开节约电力的竞赛。乌里扬诺夫斯克“接触器”制造厂的电力工人在今年头三个季度中已节约了七万度电，在读了苏共中央的信以后，他们又决定把一些耗电多的生产设备换成耗电较少的，并安装自动测温器来自动控制用电量以便进一步节约用电。
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团团员一向是苏联各种节约运动中的尖兵。这一次他们也不甘落后，他们已建立起突击检查岗或工作队，来严格检查企业、机关和集体农庄在生产上和生活上用电的情况，及时杜绝浪费电力的现象。（附图片）
