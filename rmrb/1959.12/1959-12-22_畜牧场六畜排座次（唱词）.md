　　Ranking the Six Domestic Animals in the Livestock Farm (Lyrics)
　　Lyrics by Yi Heyuan, Illustration by Didi
　　One day the weather was very clear,
　　The companions sunbathed in the livestock farm,
　　The rooster crowed a song,
　　The sheep bleated in chorus.
　　The Palomino horse strolled on the field,
　　The old water buffalo crunched and munched grass busily.
　　The big black pig stretched out its legs on the ground,
　　A little dog ran from outside the field, barking woof woof!
　　Truly a prosperous scene of six domestic animals,
　　Brothers and sisters gathered together harmoniously.
　　Suddenly the rooster spoke:
　　"Brothers, sit down together and discuss,
　　The masters often praise us,
　　Saying each of us has strong abilities.
　　Everyone's abilities are different,
　　Who is the strongest among the six domestic animals?"
　　The Palomino horse refused to concede upon hearing this,
　　He said: "I am the king among the six domestic animals!
　　—Horse, Cow, Sheep, Chicken, Dog, Pig, people have said it long ago,
　　Why discuss it again today?"
　　The rooster said: "Brother Horse speaks too rashly,
　　What's the use of turning over the old almanac again!
　　The old order may not be appropriate,
　　It is appropriate to discuss again.
　　If you have the ability, tell us,
　　Let everyone decide together."
　　The Palomino horse's anger rose upon hearing this,
　　He said: "My abilities are strong and strong,
　　I run like flying,
　　Helping a lot with transportation,
　　Only hear the sound of hooves dada da,
　　I pull the cart and send public grain!……
　　Who can compare to these abilities?
　　If I am not the king, who is?"
　　While the Palomino horse was admiring himself,
　　The old water buffalo opened his mouth from the side:
　　"I am strong and powerful,
　　I am an expert in plowing and planting,
　　I don't say a second word about serving the people,
　　I only want to produce more grain.
　　The grass I eat, the milk I produce, is very nutritious,
　　Masters eat it to improve their health.
　　I haven't thought about whether the ranking is before or after,
　　But Brother Horse's opinion should still be discussed."
　　Before the words were finished, the sheep took over:
    "Old Cow's attitude is worthy of praise,
　　Everywhere is humble, a good example,
　　Unlike Old Horse, whose arrogance is rampant.
　　I don't have many advantages,
　　All depend on a good coat,
　　The wool is fine and soft, really beautiful,
　　Made into clothes, unparalleled in the world.
　　It can keep out the cold and block the wind,
　　Everyone wears it warmly.……”
　　The rooster looked at the black pig again:
    "You also explain your abilities in detail."
　　The big black pig spoke calmly:
    "My pig family's abilities are extraordinary,
　　It is not that I am arrogant without humility,
　　It is only right to say what I have to say.
　　First of all, the reproduction rate is faster than all the domestic animals,
　　Giving birth to a dozen in one litter is normal,
　　Generating generation after generation, the family is prosperous,
　　Ten become a hundred, and hundreds become thousands of descendants.
　　Each and every one of them can also set up factories,
　　Manufacturing large quantities of fertilizer to supply the farms.
　　The nutrition is good, the quality is high, and the crops praise it,
　　Eating it makes them grow fast and the granaries are full.
　　My skin can be made into leather, beautiful and attractive,
　　My meat tastes good, tender and fragrant.
　　My hair is very valuable and can be used to make wool textiles,
　　Pig casings and internal organs also have their uses.
　　No wonder everyone raises me,
　　My body is full of all kinds of treasures…"
　　The big black pig's words were truly powerful,
　　The companions nodded and praised him.
　　The little dog woofed and said:
　 "Old Pig's words are not exaggerated at all,
　　I used to be above him,
　　Now the ranking should be reordered."
　　The rooster asked: "Brother Horse, what do you think?"
　　The Palomino horse said: "His abilities are stronger than mine?
　　I am convinced and willing to give up the first place,
　　Old Pig should be the king among the six domestic animals.
　　I can only blame myself for being narrow-minded and blind,
    Being arrogant and absurd.
　　Please forgive me, everyone,
　　From now on, I will keep the word 'humility' in mind."
　　You said a word, he said a word, feeling relieved,
　　All guaranteed to give full play to their strengths from now on.
　　Serving mankind with high quality,
　　Living up to the master's good intentions.
　　Before long, the ranking was discussed and settled:
　　Pig, Cow, Sheep, Horse, Chicken, Dog, ranked in order.
　　Everyone was satisfied and happy,
　　Humming, singing, blowing and beating, each returned to their pen! (Attached picture)

　　畜牧场六畜排座次（唱词）
　　易和元作词  笛地配画
　　这一天天气很晴朗，
　　伙伴们畜牧场上晒太阳，
　　雄鸡喔喔把歌唱，
　　羊儿??来帮腔。
　　黄骠马散步在场上，
　　老水牛嘁嘁嚓嚓吃草忙。
　　大黑猪伸开四腿地上躺，
　　从场外跑来小狗叫汪汪！
　　真个是六畜兴旺好景象，
　　弟兄们和和气气聚一堂。
　　忽然雄鸡把话讲：
　　“弟兄们坐到一起来商量，
　　主人们常把我们来夸奖，
　　说我们一个一个本事强。
　　大家本事不一样，
　　六畜之中谁最强？”
　　黄骠马一听不相让，
　　他说道：“六畜之中我为王！
　　——马牛羊鸡犬猪早有人讲，
　　今日又来议论为哪桩？”
　　雄鸡说：“马兄说话太莽撞，
　　再翻那旧皇历有啥用场！
　　旧座次安排未必就妥当，
　　重新讨论理应当。
　　你有本事你就讲，
　　大家共同作主张。”
　　黄骠马一听怒气上，
　　他说：“我的本事强又强，
　　跑路我像飞一样，
　　交通运输帮大忙，
　　只听蹄声??响，
　　我拉起车子送公粮！……
　　这些本事谁能比得上？
　　我不为王谁为王？”
　　黄骠马正在那里自我欣赏，
　　老水牛它在一旁开了腔：
　　“我长得身强力又壮，
　　耕田种地我是内行，
　　为人民服务我不把二话讲，
　　一心只为多打粮。
　　吃的草，出的奶，很有营养，
　　主人们吃了它增进健康。
　　座次是前是后我没想，
　　不过是马兄意见还应商量。”
　　语声未落羊儿就接上腔：
    “老牛的态度值得表扬，
　　处处谦虚好榜样，
　　不像老马气焰张。
　　我的优点没几样，
　　全凭一身好衣裳，
　　羊毛细软真漂亮，
　　制成衣服世无双。
　　能够御寒把风挡，
　　人人穿上暖洋洋。……”
　　雄鸡又把黑猪望：
    “你也把本事说端详”。
　　大黑猪不慌不忙把话讲：
    “我猪家本事不寻常，
　　并非是不虚心态度狂妄，
　　有什么说什么理所应当。
　　首先是繁殖快大家畜都比不上，
　　一胎生十几个还算平常，
　　生一代又一代家口兴旺，
　　一变十十变百儿孙满堂。
　　一个个又都会开办工厂，
　　制造出大批肥料供应农庄。
　　营养好质量高庄稼夸奖，
　　吃了它长得快粮食满仓。
　　我的皮能制革美观漂亮，
　　我的肉滋味好又嫩又香。
　　我的毛很宝贵能制毛纺，
　　猪肠衣和内脏也有用场。
　　无怪乎大家都把我喂养，
　　我身上有的是诸般宝藏…”
　　大黑猪一席话真有力量，
　　伙伴们点头叫好齐赞扬。
　　小狗汪汪把话讲：
　 “老猪的话半点不夸张，
　　从前我在他之上，
　　现在应该重新序排行。”
　　雄鸡问：“马兄意见怎么样，”
　　黄骠马说：“他的本事比我强？
　　口服心服我愿把首席让，
　　六畜之中老猪该为王。
　　只怪我心胸狭窄眼不亮，
    自高自大太荒唐。
　　还请诸位多原谅，
　　从今后谦虚二字记心旁。”
　　你一言他一语心情舒畅，
　　都保证从今后发挥所长。
　　为人类服务品质高尚，
　　不辜负主人们一片心肠。
　　不多久座次商量停当：
　　猪牛羊马鸡犬依次排行。
　　个个满意心花放，
　　哼的哼，唱的唱，吹吹打打各回圈房！（附图片）
