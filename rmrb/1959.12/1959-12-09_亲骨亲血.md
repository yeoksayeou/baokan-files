    Kin by Bone and Blood
    Wang Junde, Jinxi Jiangjiatun People's Commune, Liaoning
    I've been working in the countryside away from Jinxi for over two years. Whenever I go to the county for meetings, I always visit the house where I used to live. The new owners always warmly welcome me and invite me to eat. Recently, I came to Jinxi again, and naturally, I wanted to see my "old home." Along the way, neighbors greeted me and told me that the house had a new owner, a woman named Aunt Yuan, who lived there with only her son, who worked in a machine factory. One of the women added, "Oh! That son of hers is so genuinely filial to her, just like a real son." This piqued my curiosity. I asked, "Oh, is he adopted?" The neighbor replied, "Adopted? Not at all! The old mother is from the Northeast, and the son is from Sichuan." I was even more surprised and, without asking for more details, headed straight to Aunt Yuan's house.
    As soon as I entered, the neighbor who came with me introduced me to Aunt Yuan, saying, "Auntie! This is Old Wang, he used to live in this house." Aunt Yuan quickly invited me to sit on the kang, offered cigarettes and tea, and was very warm. Although Aunt Yuan was seventy-two years old, she was still quite robust.
    As I drank my tea, I asked Aunt Yuan about her life. She said, "Now, I'm living a life of ease, but the past is just too painful to mention." When old people talk about the past, they're always very talkative. Aunt Yuan recounted her life story, and when she spoke of those years of hardship, the old woman's eyes reddened. Aunt Yuan came from a poor family. At the age of sixteen, she married a man twenty years her senior. Her husband had worked as a laborer for landlords since he was a child and had injured himself. To pay for his medical treatment, the meager family assets were gradually sold off. When Aunt Yuan's son, Yuan Dianchen, was eight years old, her husband died. Aunt Yuan led her son to beg door-to-door and barely managed to collect enough money to buy a thin coffin, just enough to get the old man buried.
    After her husband died, the neighbors all advised Aunt Yuan, "While you're still young, leave! Find a suitable family, and you won't have to beg with your child!" Aunt Yuan thought that life was the same for the unfortunate wherever they went. She was also afraid that her child would be mistreated in someone else's home, and be called "drag-along child", so she thought it was better to raise the child herself, begging for a living! When Yuan Dianchen turned ten, he started herding pigs and sheep for the landlord. Aunt Yuan did laundry and starching for the landlord's family to get a bowl of food.
    In 1948, her hometown was liberated, and Aunt Yuan and her son finally saw the light. Together with the poor peasants, they overthrew the landlord and received nine mu of land, one and a half houses, and over one shi of grain. Aunt Yuan had never seen so much grain before. She was so happy that she didn't know what to do and bowed to the image of Chairman Mao whenever she saw it on the street.
    In 1950, American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea. When the flames of war reached the Yalu River, Yuan Dianchen signed up to join the Volunteer Army without telling his mother. At that time, the village cadres didn't want Yuan Dianchen to go because he was an only child; but Yuan Dianchen insisted on going. When his mother heard that her son wanted to join the army, she was in a state of turmoil, unable to sit still or stand still. However, Aunt Yuan was not an unreasonable person. In order to repel the American aggressors and protect the good times, Aunt Yuan resolutely handed over her only son, on whom she depended for life.
    In one battle, Yuan Dianchen died a glorious death. The village cadres were afraid that the old woman would be too heartbroken, so they originally didn't plan to tell Aunt Yuan the news, but they also considered that not telling her wouldn't be a long-term solution. When Aunt Yuan heard that her son was gone, she cried her heart out. Indeed, Dianchen was her mother's lifeline!
    Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army, as well as cadres, often went to Aunt Yuan's home to express their condolences and comfort her, saying, "Don't be too sad, old woman, we are all your sons..." Aunt Yuan felt very relieved when she heard this, but when she sat down alone at home, she felt sad again. Although she had so many sons, none of them could stay by her side. The old woman often fantasized about adopting a godson, like her own son Dianchen, and living together. How wonderful that would be!
    Aunt Yuan's fantasy became a reality. She had a son, and, just as the neighbors said, he was no different from her own son.
    Aunt Yuan's son is named Shuai Shiyan, a native of Sichuan, and a very good member of the Communist Youth League. In 1956, Shuai Shiyan was discharged from the Navy. He had no family left. After being discharged, he immediately went to the government and requested, "...I am willing to be a son to all the elderly family members of revolutionary martyrs. However, I am only one person and cannot divide myself, please help me introduce a family member of a martyr who has no relatives, and I will be responsible for supporting them." At his repeated request, the Civil Affairs Section of the Jinxi County People's Committee introduced Aunt Yuan to be his mother.
    At that time, Shuai Shiyan worked at the Jinxi Machine Factory, and Aunt Yuan lived in Gaoqiao. They couldn't be together every day, and the mother and son missed each other. Once, Aunt Yuan fell ill, and Shuai Shiyan received a letter and immediately asked for leave to see his mother. His mother was seriously ill and couldn't get out of bed, so he took care of her in every way, both inside and outside. Gaoqiao didn't have good medicine, so he went to the Jinxi Pharmaceutical Company to buy it. The pharmaceutical company didn't have it either, so he contacted other places. He didn't leave until his mother recovered. In order to take care of his mother's life and to relieve the old woman's loneliness, Shuai Shiyan found a house in Jinxi and brought the old woman to Jinxi. Every month, he gave all his salary to his mother to manage. Whenever the old lady had a slight headache or fever, the son would buy fruits and canned food without being asked. He not only took care of her in every possible way, but also comforted his mother spiritually. At one point, Aunt Yuan was worried that Shuai Shiyan would leave in the future and felt uneasy. Comrade Shuai Shiyan saw this feeling in his mother's heart and said, "Mom! I am your real son, the flesh and blood that came from your body. We will never be separated." From then on, the mother no longer had any worries.
    Every morning, Aunt Yuan gets up very early, quietly cooks rice and prepares dishes, afraid of making any noise and waking up her sleeping son. Once the food is ready, she affectionately calls out, "Shiyan, get up and eat." She always leaves the best food for her son. The two always push and let each other: "Shiyan, you eat it, you work hard all day, you should eat something good." "Mom! You eat it! You are old, you should pay attention to your health."
    Aunt Yuan often thinks about her son's marriage and hopes to have a fat grandson as soon as possible. The old woman couldn't hold back the words in her heart and asked her son, "Shiyan! Aren't you going to find someone? If you like a girl, tell Mom, and Mom will talk to her." Shiyan immediately said, "Mom, when I find someone, I must find someone who is good to you and filial to you."
    I listened quietly to Aunt Yuan's story. Unknowingly, it was very late, and I had to say goodbye.
    On the way, my legs were moving mechanically, but my heart remained in Aunt Yuan's home. This small family is full of warmth, like an invisible fire in the center of the room, a fire ignited by the class love and motherly love intertwined. Aunt Yuan's original son, Yuan Dianchen, shed his last drop of blood on the mountains of Korea, but he will always be smiling. As a soldier, his mission has been taken over by his comrades-in-arms, and as his mother's son, his responsibility has also been taken over by an unfamiliar comrade-in-arms - Shuai Shiyan. What Shuai Shiyan has done is so natural, but it also shows what a noble soldier's heart he has.
    I am happy for Aunt Yuan, happy that she has such a filial good son in her old age; I am also happy for Comrade Shuai Shiyan, that he has such a loving mother. I sincerely wish them both a happier life. (Attached picture)

    亲骨亲血
    辽宁锦西江家屯人民公社　王俊德
    我离开锦西到乡里工作，已经两年多了。每逢到县开会，我都要回到原先住过的那栋房里去看望看望。这儿的新主人，总是热情地招待我，留我吃饭。最近，我又到锦西来，不用说，又要到“老家”看看。路上，左邻右舍都跟我打招呼，并且告诉我说，那房子又换了新主人，是一位叫袁大妈的，家里只有娘儿俩，儿子在机械厂工作。一位大嫂还补充说：“咳！人家那儿子，对老人可实在孝敬，和亲生儿子没两样。”这话引起了我的好奇心。我问：“怎么，是过继的儿子吗？”邻人回答说：“哪里是过继！老妈妈是东北人，儿子是四川人。”我更惊异了，没顾详细打听，直奔袁大妈家去了。
    一进门，同来的邻人便向袁大妈介绍说：“大妈！这是老王，从前他就住这房子。”袁大妈连忙把我让到炕上，递烟倒茶，十分亲热。袁大妈虽然是七十二岁的人了，身子骨却还很结实。
    我一边喝茶，一边问起袁大妈生活景况，她说：“如今，我是享清福了，可说起从前，那真是提不得。”老年人说到过往的事，总是滔滔不绝的，袁大妈向我叙述了她的身世，当说到那些受尽磨难的年月时，老人家的眼圈红了。袁大妈自小家穷，十六岁那年，嫁给一个比她大二十岁的丈夫。丈夫从小给地主扛活，累伤了身子。为了给他治病，薄薄的家产逐渐变卖光了。袁大妈的儿子袁殿臣八岁的时候，她的丈夫死了。袁大妈领着儿子挨门挨户磕头，好容易凑了几个钱买了一口薄棺材，算把老爷子抬出去了。
    丈夫死后，街坊邻居们都劝袁大嫂：“趁还年青，走了吧！找一个合适的人家，省了领着孩子去要饭！”袁大妈想，苦命的人，到哪儿都是一样，又恐怕把孩子带到别人家受气，让人喊“带犊子”，不如拉扯着孩子，讨着要着过吧！袁殿臣到十岁的时候就开始给地主家放猪、放羊。袁大妈给地主家洗洗浆浆，混碗饭吃。
    1948年，家乡解放了，袁大妈母子算是熬出头了。他们和贫苦农民一起，斗倒地主，自己分得了九亩地，一间半房子，一石多粮食。袁大妈从来也没有见过这么多粮食。她高兴得不知怎么好，在街上见着毛主席像就行礼。
    1950年，美帝国主义发动了侵朝战争。当战火燃烧到鸭绿江边的时候，袁殿臣瞒着妈妈，报名参加了志愿军。当时，村干部不让袁殿臣去，因为他是独生子；可是袁殿臣非去不可。妈妈听到儿子要参军，顿时心乱如麻，坐不定立不安。可是，袁大妈不是一个不明白的人，为了打退美国侵略者，为了保住大好的时光，袁大妈毅然交出了她唯一的、相依为命的儿子。
    在一次战斗中，袁殿臣光荣牺牲了。村干部们怕老人家过于伤心，本来不打算把这消息告诉袁大妈，但又考虑到，不告诉，日久天长了终究不是个事呀。袁大妈一听说儿子不在了，哭得死去活来。可不是，殿臣是妈妈的命根子呀！
    解放军、志愿军战士们，还有干部们，经常到袁大妈家去慰问，安慰大妈说：“你老人家别太伤心，我们都是您的儿子……。”袁大妈听了这话，很舒心，可是，当她孤孤单单在家里坐下来的时候，就又难过起来。虽然有这么多的儿子，可都不能留在自己身边。大妈常常幻想着，要是能收一个干儿子，像亲生儿子殿臣一样，生活在一起，有多好啊！
    袁大妈的幻想变成了现实。她有了一个儿子，而且，正像邻人们说的，和她的亲生儿子没有两样。
    袁大妈的儿子名叫帅士炎，四川人，是一个很好的共青团员。1956年，帅士炎从海军部队复员了。他家里已经没有人了。复员后，他立即就到政府请求说：“……我愿意给所有的烈属老人做儿子。不过，我只一个人，没法分开身子，请政府帮我介绍一位没有了亲人的烈属，我负责奉养。”在他再三请求下，锦西县人民委员会民政科便把袁大妈介绍给他做母亲了。
    当时，帅士炎在锦西机械厂工作，袁大妈在高桥住，不能每天在一起，母子俩彼此想念着。有一次，袁大妈生病了，帅士炎接到信，立即请假去看母亲。母亲病重，不能下床，他就端屎端尿，里里外外侍候着老人。高桥没有好药，他到锦西医药公司去买。医药公司也没有，他又到别的地方去联系。直到妈妈病好，他才离开。为了照顾母亲的生活，为了解除老人的孤独和寂寞，帅士炎又在锦西找了房子，把老人家接到锦西来了。每月发下工资，他就全部交给母亲掌管。老太太稍有些头疼脑热的，不用作声，儿子就把水果、罐头买回来了。他不仅生活上照顾得无微不至，更主要的从精神上安慰他的母亲。曾有一度，袁大妈怕帅士炎以后会走，有些不放心。帅士炎同志看出了母亲这种心情，就说：“妈！我就是您老的亲儿子了，就是你老身上掉下来的亲骨亲血，咱母子俩，永远也不会分离了。”从此，母亲再没有一丝儿不放心了。
    袁大妈每天早晨很早就起来，轻手轻脚地煮饭、熬菜，恐怕有一点响声，惊醒了甜睡的儿子。饭菜弄好了，就亲切地唤着：“士炎哪，起来吃饭。”有一点什么好吃的，总是留给儿子。娘俩总是你推我让的：“士炎，你吃吧，干一天活很累了，应当吃点好的。”“妈！你老人家吃吧！年老的人了，应当注意保养。”
    袁大妈常常思念着儿子的婚事，盼望能早日抱上胖孙子。老太太实在忍不住心里的话，便问儿子：“士炎哪！你还不搞个对象啊？你看上谁家姑娘，就告妈一声，妈给你说去。”士炎立刻说：“妈妈，我搞对象，一定要找个对你老人家好，孝敬你老人家的。”
    我静静地听袁大妈叙说着。不觉，天已很晚，不得不告辞了。
    路上，我的两条腿在机械地迈动，而我的心，却留在袁大妈家里了。这个小小的家庭里充满了温暖，就像屋子正中放了一炉看不见的火，这是阶级的爱和母子的爱交织在一起所燃起的火。大妈原先的儿子袁殿臣，在朝鲜的山岭上流尽了最后一滴血，然而，他会永远含着微笑。作为一个战士，他的任务由战友们接替了，作为妈妈的儿子，他的责任也由一位不相识的战友——帅士炎接替了。帅士炎所做的，是多么自然的事情，然而，这也显示出了，他有着一颗怎样崇高的战士的心。
    我为袁大妈庆幸，庆幸她晚年时有了这样一位孝顺的好儿子；我也为帅士炎同志高兴，他有了这样一位慈爱的妈妈。我衷心地祝福他们母子俩，祝他们生活得更幸福。（附图片）
