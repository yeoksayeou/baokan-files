    Resolving Ideological Knots

    Liu Xiuying is a female worker in the winding section of the assembly workshop at the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory. She generally completes her production tasks, but she always looks worried, as if she has a big knot in her heart.

    Her thoughts were seen through by Li Zhilan, a Communist Party member and veteran worker. So, she took the initiative to have a heart-to-heart talk with her. It turned out that Liu Xiuying believed that "she is a middle school graduate, and the winding job is not commensurate with her education," and she always wanted to change jobs. Li Zhilan patiently explained to Liu Xiuying the relationship between education and production, and the relationship between individual interests and national interests. Liu Xiuying felt that this made a lot of sense, so she did as Li Zhilan said. In production, she constantly exceeded quotas, and the quality was also high, making her an advanced producer in the factory.

    The factory launched a technical performance competition. Liu Xiuying and her apprentice, Li Yueting, both had concerns: Liu Xiuying was afraid of being overtaken by her apprentice; Li Yueting was also afraid of surpassing his master and losing face. After Li Zhilan discovered their thoughts, she encouraged Liu Xiuying, saying, "Be bold and perform, don't be afraid of your apprentice catching up. If the apprentice surpasses the master, it shows that the master has fulfilled her responsibility to the apprentice and has been patient in helping!" At the same time, she encouraged Li Yueting: "Work hard to perform and strive to break the record and win honor for your master. Don't be afraid of surpassing your master; if you do, it shows that you are learning from your master with an open mind." In this way, both the master and apprentice were relieved of their worries, and their enthusiasm was even greater. When winding ㄇ—4 coils, the master's highest daily output in the past was forty, while Li Yueting reached eighty. Liu Xiuying rose to the challenge. Later, Li Yueting further increased it to ninety.

    解思想疙瘩
    刘秀英，是沈阳低压开关厂装配车间绕线工段的女工。生产任务一般都能完成，可就是愁眉苦脸的，心里总好像有一个大疙瘩。
    她的心思，叫共产党员、老工人李芝兰看透了。于是，便主动找她谈心。原来刘秀英认为“自己是个中学毕业生，绕线这个工种与自己的文化不相称”，总想调换一下工作。李芝兰便耐心地向刘秀英讲解文化和生产的关系，个人利益和国家利益的关系。刘秀英听了觉得很有道理，就按照李芝兰的话去做。在生产上，不断突破定额，而且质量也高，成为厂里的先进生产者。
    厂里开展了技术表演赛运动。刘秀英和徒工李跃廷都有顾虑：刘秀英怕自己被徒弟拉下；李跃廷也怕超过了自己的师傅，面子上不好看。李芝兰发现了他们的心思后，一面鼓励刘秀英：“要大胆表演，不要怕徒弟撵上，如果徒弟超过了师傅，这说明是师傅对徒弟尽到了责任，耐心帮助的结果呀！”一面又鼓励李跃廷：“努力表演，争取打破纪录，给师傅争光。不要怕超过了师傅，如果超过，这说明你虚心向师傅学习。”这样一来，师徒双方顾虑都解除了，劲头鼓得更足。在绕制ㄇ—4线圈时，过去师傅最高日产量达四十个，而李跃廷却达到八十个，刘秀英起而直追。后来李跃廷又提高到九十个。
