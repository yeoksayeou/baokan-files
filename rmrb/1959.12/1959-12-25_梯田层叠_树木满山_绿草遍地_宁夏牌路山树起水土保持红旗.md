According to a report in the Ningxia Daily: After five years of tenacious struggle with nature, and especially in the past year or so, the Hui and Han commune members of Chengguan Commune in Haiyuan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, relying on the powerful strength of the commune, have conscientiously implemented the policy of "overall planning, comprehensive treatment according to local conditions, centralized continuous treatment, combining slope and gully treatment, with slope treatment as the main focus" for soil and water conservation. They have transformed the severely eroded and barren Pailu Mountain into a new socialist mountainous area with terraced fields, strip fields layered upon each other, trees covering the mountains, and green grass covering the ground. This commune has successively received awards from the State Council, the Communist Youth League Central Committee, the Autonomous Region, and Haiyuan County, becoming a red banner for large-scale soil and water conservation in the Autonomous Region.

Pailu Mountain is located ten li east of Haiyuan County, and is a branch of the Nanhua Mountain extending northward, with an altitude of approximately 1,900 meters and an area of approximately 60,000 mu. The area includes three large mountains, twenty small hills, two large gullies, and eighty-one branch gullies, which fragment the area into pieces, with pits and depressions everywhere. Before liberation, due to severe soil erosion, this area was often characterized by "three empties" (empty of seeds, empty of fertilizer, empty of crops) and "five harms" (drought, wind, frost, hail, and freezing), as well as a lack of "four materials" (feed, fuel, fertilizer, and timber), making it an impoverished area. After liberation, after five years of comprehensive treatment, concentrated treatment, and continuous treatment, especially after the overall assault and year-round treatment following the people's commune movement, Pailu Mountain, once a "mountain of disaster" and a "gully of harm," fundamentally changed its appearance and became a treasure mountain rich in resources for Haiyuan County. To date, the broad masses of Hui and Han commune members have planted 3.6 million trees of various types, including fruit trees, timber trees, windbreak trees, and scenic trees, on more than 30,000 mu of land with the most serious soil erosion on Pailu Mountain. The largest trees have grown to two or three meters high, and some have already blossomed and borne fruit. They have also built 30,080 mu of terraced fields, strip fields, embankments, gully head protection, and stepped fields. All of the original 114 sinkholes, some as deep as several dozen zhang, have been filled. The narrow paths have also been renovated into wide pedestrian paths and carriage roads crisscrossing the area, completely controlling soil erosion over an area of more than 30,000 mu. Elderly people in their seventies and eighties who live here, when climbing Pailu Mountain, exclaimed in surprise: "Pailu Mountain has really changed a lot. The people have turned over, the land has turned over, and even the dry mountains can turn over!"

The treatment of Pailu Mountain began in 1954 during the agricultural cooperative period. After several years of continuous assault treatment and comprehensive treatment, soil erosion on some land was initially controlled. However, the agricultural cooperatives at that time had limited manpower and could not concentrate on treatment year-round, so they could only carry out assault treatment in the spring and autumn seasons. Furthermore, due to the lack of unified and comprehensive treatment rules, they had to adopt a "piecemeal" approach, which meant that some projects did not fully play a role in maintaining soil and water. After the people's commune movement, the commune's Party committee promptly summarized this experience and lesson, and proposed the policy of overall and comprehensive treatment: "Turn mountain tops into gardens, create strip fields on gentle slopes, construct stepped fields in gully bends, build terraced fields on cultivated land, link roads with ring ponds, create fish-scale pits on steep slopes, build protection dams at gully heads, and construct check dams at the bottom of gullies." At the same time, it conducted a detailed and comprehensive survey of Pailu Mountain, divided it into suitable areas for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry according to the comprehensive treatment policy, and adopted different measures for treatment according to the different characteristics of each area. It also made unified arrangements for the commune's labor force, drawing more than 300 laborers from each production brigade to form a year-round capital construction team, and drawing more than 900 laborers from each large team to form an assault team. In terms of steps, it adopted a comprehensive and centralized treatment from the watershed to the slope foot, from the branch gullies to the main gullies, from top to bottom, and from small to large, so that water could be stored step by step everywhere in the gullies and slopes, with defenses set up step by step, and mud blocked in sections. In terms of methods, it adopted a combination of year-round treatment and renovation of existing projects with short-term assault construction of new projects, a combination of biological measures such as planting grass and trees with field projects, a combination of slope treatment and gully treatment, a combination of water storage and soil and water conservation, and a combination of afforestation and sorting and cultivation, so that the projects undertaken were not only large in quantity but also high in quality, and achieved the requirements of treating one slope, completing one slope, greening one slope, and consolidating one slope, and treating one gully, completing one gully, greening one gully, and consolidating one gully. At present, the soil and water conservation of the entire Pailu Mountain has reached a high standard, completely controlling soil erosion over an area of 20 square kilometers; 95% of the trees have survived, and many of the former abandoned gullies and rotten mountains have gradually gained benefits.

The treatment of Pailu Mountain has played a huge role in accelerating the socialist construction of mountainous areas and promoting the development of production. It is estimated that after the treatment of Pailu Mountain, 100,000 tons of sediment will not flow into reservoirs and the Yellow River each year, playing a certain role in fundamentally controlling the Yellow River and protecting the Shixiakou Reservoir project. Due to the complete eradication of flood hazards and the interception of floods, the more than 10,000 mu of land on Pailu Mountain alone can increase grain production by 500,000 to 600,000 jin per year. The large-scale utilization of abandoned gullies and barren slopes for planting various crops has generated an income of more than 16,500 yuan for Chengguan Commune in 1958 and 1959 alone, which can be used to purchase 275 head of draught cattle or more than 900 seven-inch walking plows. In soil and water conservation work, a total of 495 mu of sweet clover has been planted in the past two years, and more than 740,000 jin of fodder grass has been harvested and stored, promoting the development of animal husbandry.

　　梯田层叠　树木满山　绿草遍地
    宁夏牌路山树起水土保持红旗
    据宁夏日报报道　宁夏回族自治区海原县城关公社的回、汉社员，经过五年来和大自然的顽强搏斗，特别是近一年多来，依靠公社的强大威力，认真贯彻执行了“全面规划，因地制宜地综合治理，集中地连续治理，坡沟兼治，治坡为主”的水土保持方针，把水土流失极为严重的干山秃岭的牌路山，治理成梯田、带子田层叠，树木满山，绿草遍地的社会主义新山区。这个公社先后受到国务院、团中央、自治区和海原县的奖励，成为自治区大面积开展水土保持的一面红旗。
    牌路山位于海原县城东十华里的地方，是南华山向北伸展的一条支脉，海拔约一千九百米，面积六万亩左右；境内有三座大山、二十个小山头，两条大沟和八十一条支毛沟，把这块地方割裂得支离破碎，陷穴遍地。解放前，由于水土流失严重，这里常常是“三光”（种子光、肥料光、庄稼光）、“五害”（旱、风、霜、雹、冻）俱全，“四料”（饲料、燃料、肥料、木料）缺乏的贫苦地区。解放以后，经过五年的综合治理，集中治理，连续治理，特别是人民公社化以后的全面突击治理和常年治理以后，使“祸山”、“害沟”的牌路山从根本上改变了面貌，变成了海原县的一座资源丰富的宝山。到目前为止，广大回、汉社员，已在牌路山上水土流失最严重的三万多亩土地上种植了果树林、用材林、防风林、风景林等各种树木三百六十万株，最大的已经长到二、三米高，有的已经开花结果；修挖梯田、带子田、培地埂、沟头防护、台阶地等三万零八十亩；对原有的一百一十四个深达十几丈的陷穴，全部填平；羊肠小道也整修成纵横交错的宽大的人行道和马车路，全部控制水土流失面积三万亩以上。住在这里的七、八十岁的老人，登上牌路山，都惊奇地说：“牌路山真是大变样，人翻身，地翻身，干山也能翻身！”
    牌路山的治理工作，是从1954年农业社时期开始的。经过几年的连续突击治理和综合治理，初步控制了一部分土地水土流失。但是，当时的农业社人力单薄，不可能常年集中治理，只能在春、秋两季突击治理；还由于没有统一的全面治理规则，只好采取“零敲碎打”的方法，使某些工程没有完全起到保持水土的作用。人民公社化以后，公社党委及时总结了这个经验教训，提出了山头修花园，缓坡带子田，沟弯台阶地，耕地修梯田，道路连环池，陡坡鱼鳞坑，沟头防护坝，沟底修谷坊的全面治理、综合治理的方针；同时对牌路山进行了细致的全面考察，根据综合治理的方针分别划出了宜农、宜林、宜牧区，根据各个区域的不同特点，采取了不同的措施进行治理；又把全社的劳力做了统一安排，从各生产大队抽调了三百多个劳力，组成一支常年基建队，各大队又抽出九百多个劳力组成突击队。在步骤上，采取从分水岭到坡脚，从支毛沟到干沟，由上到下，由小到大地全面集中地治理，使沟、坡到处能够节节蓄水，步步设防，分段拦泥。在方法上，采取了常年治理和整修旧有工程与短期突击新修工程相结合，种草、种树等生物措施与田间工程相结合，治坡与治沟相结合，蓄水与水土保持相结合，植树造林与整理培育相结合等办法，使所做的工程不但数量多，而且质量高，并达到了治一坡、成一坡、绿化一坡、巩固一坡，治一沟、成一沟、绿化一沟、巩固一沟的要求。现在，全牌路山的水土保持已达到高标准化，全部控制了二十平方公里的水土流失；95％的树木已经成活，许多过去的废沟、烂山也逐步获得收益。
    牌路山的治理，对加速山区的社会主义建设、促进生产的发展，起了巨大作用。据估计，牌路山治理以后，每年将有十万吨泥沙不致流入水库和黄河，对根治黄河和保护石峡口水库工程起到了一定作用；由于彻底根治了洪水危害和拦蓄了洪水，仅牌路山上的一万多亩土地每年就可增产粮食五、六十万斤；大量利用了废沟荒坡种植各种作物，仅1958和1959两年，城关公社利用治理好的废沟荒坡种植的各种作物，就收入一万六千五百多元，用这些钱可以购买二百七十五头耕牛或买九百多部七吋步犁；在水土保持工作中，去、今两年共种植草木樨四百九十五亩，收贮饲草七十四万多斤，促进了畜牧业的发展。
