Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Washington: The American "Cold War" forces continue to advocate a policy of "strength."

Following Army Secretary Brucker, CIA Director Allen Dulles also delivered a "Cold War" tirade at a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers on the 4th. He viciously slandered the Soviet Union for pursuing a policy of "aggression" and carrying out "economic infiltration, political warfare, and subversion" against newly emerging nationally independent countries. Under the tattered guise of the Soviet "threat," Allen Dulles clamored that "we must not lapse into a complacent attitude that might leave the Communists in doubt as to our intentions." He said that the United States and "free nations" "must always be prepared in defense to deal with communist aggression."

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee released on the 5th a report prepared for it by a research institution at Johns Hopkins University. This report did its utmost to advocate that the United States should continue to expand its armaments. Using the excuse that the United States' lagging behind the Soviet Union in science and technology "poses an unprecedented and enormous danger to the security of the United States," the report emphasized that the United States should "make every effort to develop strong and reliable missiles and then mass-produce them." At the same time, the report openly opposed the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, clamoring that the United States should maintain a so-called "retaliatory force," and advocated continuing to focus foreign "aid" on military assistance. The report said, "Although military defense needs to be supplemented by economic, psychological, and other policies, providing sufficient and appropriate military forces is a prerequisite for world security."

Senator Jackson announced on the 4th that his Senate subcommittee had consulted with senior government policymakers and non-governmental experts to study the issue of reforming "government organizations responsible for the Cold War." He said he had received many suggestions, one of which called for the President of the United States to make an annual report on the "necessary measures for the Cold War."

    美国好战分子纷纷出场
    叫嚷扩充军备发展导弹
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国“冷战”势力继续在鼓吹“实力”政策。
    继陆军部长布鲁克之后，美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯4日又在全国制造商协会的集会上大放“冷战”厥词。他恶毒地诬蔑苏联推行“侵略”政策，对新兴的民族独立国家进行“经济渗透、政治战和颠覆活动”。艾伦·杜勒斯在苏联“威胁”这个破烂的幌子下叫嚷说，“我们一定不能流于一种心安理得的态度，那种态度可能使共产党人对于我们的意图有所怀疑”。他说，美国和“自由国家”“在防务上必须时刻准备好对付共产党的侵略”。
    美国参议院外交委员会5日发表了约翰·霍普金斯大学的一个研究机构为它准备的报告，这个报告竭力鼓吹美国要继续扩充军备。报告以美国在科学技术方面落后于苏联“使美国的安全遭到空前巨大的危险”为借口，强调美国要“全力发展强有力的、可靠的导弹，然后大规模地生产这种导弹”。报告同时公然反对苏联关于全面和彻底裁军的建议，叫嚣美国要保持所谓“报复力量”，并且主张继续把对外“援助”的重点放在军事援助上。报告说，“虽然军事防御需要经济、心理和其他方面的政策加以补充，提供充分和适当的军事力量是世界安全的先决条件”。
    美国参议员杰克逊4日宣布，他的参议院小组委员会已经同高级的政府决策人和非政府的专家进行磋商，研究革新“负责冷战的政府组织机构”问题。他说，他收到许多建议，其中之一要求美国总统就“冷战的必要措施”每年作一次报告。
