Six Years Without a Sick Pig
    Sichuan Luzhou Special District Horticultural Science Institute Pig Farm Enhances Disease Resistance of Pigs Through Multiple Measures

    (By our reporter) The Sichuan Luzhou Special District Horticultural Science Institute has fully utilized the superior conditions of large-scale pig farming, followed the characteristics of collective pig raising, and strengthened feeding management, effectively preventing the occurrence of diseases. It has achieved an outstanding record of six years without sick or dead pigs. Currently, the number of pigs in the pens has increased from 274 in 1954 to 1,052. This year, in addition to self-breeding and self-raising, by the end of October, it has also supported other areas with 254 high-quality breeding pigs, and transferred and self-consumed 332 pigs. Another batch of fat pigs will be out of the trough before the Spring Festival. All existing pigs are strong and healthy.

    Since 1954, this institute has adhered to the principle of self-breeding and self-raising, effectively preventing the spread of pig diseases. In self-breeding and self-raising, importance is attached to the selection of pig breeds, and high-quality pigs with particularly strong disease resistance are cultivated. They choose Rongchang purebred white sows crossed with Yorkshire purebred boars. The first-generation piglets produced are not only particularly resistant to diseases, but also have a large body shape, are willing to eat, and grow quickly. They can grow to more than 200 jin in one year, and the fastest can reach more than 300 jin.

    In terms of pig management, the Horticultural Science Institute, based on the principle of diligence and thrift, built large pig pens at various points, with each pen holding two to three hundred pigs. All pigs are penned according to type and grade. Sows and meat pigs are penned separately, which facilitates centralized management. Adult sows are kept in individual pens, while meat pigs are grouped into pens according to grade. After implementing this method, the size difference of the pigs in each pen is not large, avoiding bullying the small and squeezing the weak, ensuring even feeding, consistent growth, and making each pig strong and healthy, which greatly enhances disease resistance.

    After pigs are penned according to type and grade, and in response to the different eating characteristics of large and small pigs, it was determined that piglets should be fed four times a day and large pigs three times a day, strictly observing feeding times, so that pigs have a fixed time for eating, activity, and sleep. In terms of feed formulation, measures such as green roughage as the main ingredient, variety, washing and chopping finely, raw and cooked combination, even mixing and hot feeding, and proper dryness and clarity are adopted. Various feeds are carefully processed before feeding and are supplied in fixed quantities, first dry then thin, little by little, ensuring that pigs do not picky about food, and achieve clean troughs and dry pens.

    All pig farms have established strict epidemic prevention systems. The area around the sick pens is strictly sealed off, and piglet activity areas are equipped with bamboo fences to prevent wild livestock from entering and spreading germs. Usually, people are not allowed to enter the site without reason; entry must strictly comply with the epidemic prevention system and do a good job of disinfection to avoid bringing in germs. The floors and walls of all pig pens are regularly disinfected to isolate diseases and prevent their spread. Pig pens are cleaned three to four times a day to keep the pens dry and the troughs clean. Cleaning tools are dedicated to each pen; all pig farms and piglet activity areas are thoroughly disinfected once a month.

    All pig farms also conduct regular preventive injections. "Rabbit-adapted swine fever vaccine" is injected once each in spring, autumn, and winter to prevent swine fever; erysipelas vaccine is injected once within July and August (before the beginning of autumn) to prevent swine erysipelas; and swine plague vaccine is injected twice in February and July to prevent swine plague. If an epidemic occurs, it will be immediately sent to the isolated pig farm for treatment to prevent it from spreading.

    Here are three measures taken to prevent piglet diseases: 1. Exchange nursing. Within three days of piglets being born, piglets born to one sow are given to another sow to nurse, so that the piglets can obtain many new nutrients to compensate for certain deficiencies in congenital growth conditions, promote better growth and development of the piglets, and enhance disease resistance. 2. Mountain forest grazing. Piglets are prone to white dysentery. After the piglets are born for fifteen days, the sow takes the piglets for grazing in the mountain forest until the piglets are fifty days old and should be penned (this is the case in spring, summer, autumn, and winter), which can prevent the occurrence and spread of white dysentery. The reason is that the sows and piglets are active outside all day, and are often exposed to sunlight, which enhances the activity of various functions in the body, and the ability to resist epidemics is also enhanced; at the same time, piglets find food in the ground, and can also obtain many known and unknown trace elements, which enhances the body's disease resistance. 3. Penning with the mother. After the sow takes the piglets to the pen, the piglets can sleep at regular intervals and defecate and urinate at fixed points with the sow. Only when the piglets are completely accustomed to life in the pen will the sow and piglets be separated.

    The pig raising work of the Luzhou Special District Horticultural Science Institute is well done. In addition to the above technical measures, the fundamental guarantee lies in the Party branch strengthening its leadership. The branch secretary goes to the pig farm at any time to guide feeding management work and promote advanced feeding management methods. Other branch committee members are also very concerned about pig raising work. In addition, the enthusiasm of the feeders has been fully utilized. Each pig farm selects people who love pig raising work, have a strong sense of political responsibility, have certain feeding management experience, and are easy to accept advanced experience as feeders. They cherish the pigs very much, manage them meticulously, ensure the implementation of the above measures, and promote the great development of the pig raising industry.

    六年没有一头病猪
    四川泸州专区园艺科学研究所养猪场多方增强猪只抗病能力
    本报讯　四川泸州专区园艺科学研究所，充分运用大群养猪的优越条件，按照集体养猪的特点，加强了饲养管理，有效地防止了病疫发生，取得了六年不病猪不死猪的优异成绩。现在，这里圈存猪已由1954年的二百七十四头增加到一千零五十二头。今年除了自繁自养以外，到10月底止，还支援了外地优良种猪二百五十四头，外调和自食三百三十二头，春节前还有一批肥猪出槽。现有的各类猪只头头健壮。
    这里从1954年起，就坚持贯彻了自繁自养的方针，有效地防止了猪只病疫传染。在自繁自养中，重视了猪种的选择，培育出抗病力特别强的优良猪。他们选择荣昌纯种白母猪同约克纯种公猪杂交，产出的第一代仔猪，不仅抗病力特别强，而且体形大，肯吃，肯长，一年就可长到二百多斤，最快的在三百斤以上。
    园艺科学研究所在猪只管理方面，本着勤俭的原则，分点修建了大猪圈，每个猪圈关二、三百头猪。所有的猪，都实行了分类分级关圈。母猪和肉猪是分类上圈，便于分别集中管理，成年母猪都是一猪一圈，肉猪则分级成群上圈。实行这个办法后，每个圈的猪只大小相差不大，避免了大欺小、强挤弱，做到吃食均匀，生长一致，头头健壮，抗病力也就大为增强。
    猪只分类分级关圈以后，又针对大小猪吃食的不同特点，确定了小猪一天喂四次，大猪一天喂三次，严格遵守喂食时间，使猪只饮食、活动、睡眠都有一定的时间。在饲料的配合上，采取了青粗为主、多种多样、洗净铡细、生熟搭配、调匀热喂、干清得当等办法。各种饲料喂前都作了精细处理，并实行定量供应，先干后稀，少盛勤添，使猪不择食，达到槽净圈干。
    各养猪场都建立了严格的防疫制度。病圈周围进行了严密的封锁，小猪的活动场都设有竹栏，以防止野外牲畜入内传染病菌。平常无故不让人入场；入场得严格遵守防疫制度，作好消毒工作，以免带入病菌。所有猪圈的地板墙壁，都经常消毒，隔绝病疫，防止传播。猪圈每天打扫三至四次，经常保持圈干槽净。打扫清洁的用具分圈专用；所有的养猪场和小猪活动场，每月作一次大消毒。
    各养猪场还定期进行预防注射。春、秋、冬各注射一次“兔化猪瘟苗”，预防猪瘟；在7至8月（立秋前）内注射一次丹毒菌苗，预防猪丹毒；2月和7月各注射一次猪肺疫菌苗，预防猪肺疫。如果万一发生了疫病，就立即送往隔离养猪场治疗，防止蔓延。
    这里对于防止小猪病疫，采取了三条办法：一、交换哺乳。在仔猪生下的三天内，将这个母猪产的仔猪给另一种母猪喂养，使仔猪能获得许多新的营养素，以弥补先天生长条件的某些不足，促使仔猪更好的生长发育，增强抗病能力。二、山林放牧。小猪容易发生白痢病，在仔猪出生十五天后，由母猪带着仔猪在山林放牧，直到满五十天小猪该上圈时为止（春夏秋冬都是如此），就可防止白痢病的发生和传播。原因是母猪仔猪整天在外面活动，经常受日光的照射，增强了体内各种机能的活动能力，抗疫能力也就增强了；同时，仔猪在地里寻找食物，还能获得许多知名和不知名的微量原素，使猪只增强机体的抗病力。三、随母上圈。由母猪带小猪一同上圈后，小猪可以跟着母猪定时睡眠，定点拉屎尿。待小猪完全习惯圈内生活时，才将母猪与小猪分开。
    泸州专区园艺科学研究所的养猪工作搞得好，除了以上技术措施而外，根本的保证在于党支部加强了领导。支部书记随时到养猪场指导饲养管理工作，推行先进的饲养管理方法。其他支部委员也十分关心养猪工作。此外，就是充分发挥了饲养员的积极性。各养猪场都是选择热爱养猪工作、政治责任心强、有一定饲养管理经验并容易接受先进经验的人作饲养员，他们对猪只十分爱惜，管理入微，保证了上述措施的贯彻，促进了养猪事业的大发展。
