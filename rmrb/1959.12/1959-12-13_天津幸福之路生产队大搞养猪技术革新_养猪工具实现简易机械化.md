    Tianjin Happiness Road Production Team Vigorously Promotes Technical Innovation in Pig Raising
    Simplification and Mechanization of Pig Raising Tools Achieved
    Raise More Pigs, Use Less Labor
    One caretaker feeds 200 pigs well in 20 minutes. The team's pig inventory increased by 2,000, but the labor force used for pig raising decreased by 104 people.

    (According to a report from the Hebei Daily) The Happiness Road Production Team of Xiaozhan People's Commune in Tianjin is vigorously carrying out a technical innovation movement in pig-raising tools, realizing the simplification and mechanization of pig feed processing and the pig-feeding process. Each person now feeds 200 pigs, up from 40 in the past.

    In the past, in the team's pig feed processing factory, groups of male and female commune members chopped grass and cut vegetables, working diligently from dawn till late, but still couldn't keep up with the pigs' needs. Now, only a dozen people use diesel engines to drive self-made double-cylinder pulverizers, chaff cutters, dryers, and other tools to process feed, which is enough to supply the entire team for pig feeding. Before the innovation of pig-raising tools, few pigs were raised, and a lot of labor was used. The caretakers were always covered in wet filth. Now, each caretaker stands outside the pen and feeds 200 pigs well in just 20 minutes.

    After the increase in the number of pigs, a contradiction arose for a time between pig raising and agricultural production competing for labor. Collective pig raising alone required more than 300 laborers, accounting for more than 12% of the team's total labor force. In addition, commune members raising their own pigs took up a lot of full and semi-laborers. Under these circumstances, some cadres and commune members felt that pig raising could not be increased any further, as it would affect agricultural production. Some small team cadres even transferred caretakers to engage in agricultural production. When the brigade's breeding pig farm asked the small teams for caretakers, the small teams were unwilling to give them, and even if they did, they were called back as soon as the busy farming season arrived. Problems also arose in the pulverization of pig feed. A lot of feed needed to be processed and pulverized, but it couldn't be done in time, or the processing was too rough. Some feed was just boiled in a pot and fed, resulting in the pigs disliking it and a lot of waste. The brigade's Party General Branch analyzed these situations and believed that the only way to solve the contradiction between pig raising and agricultural production competing for labor was to achieve the semi-mechanization and mechanization of pig raising production. At present, efforts should be concentrated on first solving the semi-mechanization and semi-automation of feed processing and the pig-feeding process, so as to raise more pigs with less labor. Therefore, it was decided that the Party General Branch Secretary Teng Guohua would take charge, and General Branch Committee member Chen Dezhi would be specifically responsible for leading the masses in vigorously carrying out the innovation of pig-raising tools.

    The Party General Branch fully mobilized the masses, fighting difficulties with an indomitable spirit. In the initial stage, some cadres and commune members regarded tool innovation as very mysterious, only thinking about buying machines from other places or letting workers do it. In response to this thinking, the Party General Branch first explained to the caretakers, carpentry team, and ironworking team workers that tool innovation must start from indigenous methods and be manufactured locally, criticizing various erroneous ideas and inspiring everyone to offer suggestions, quickly mobilizing the masses. Everyone summarized existing experience for imitation and modification, while also creating new tools. Liu Jinshan and Li Fengyun of the brigade's factory, after visiting other places, worked hard for three days and nights and imitated a wooden double-cylinder pulverizer, worth 30 yuan, saving more than 170 yuan compared to buying one. This pulverizer could pulverize 8,000 to 10,000 catties of feed a day, which was two times more efficient than a purchased pulverizer. The Party organization gave more help and support to the creation of new tools. Old Farm Director Yang Wanqing planned to use the principles of the fast-running cart wheel and the ability of the fan car baffle to control the amount of grain leakage to create a semi-automatic feeding trough and feeding device. Party General Branch Committee member Chen Dezhi immediately supported his idea and worked with him on trial production. Factory Director Liu Jinshan worked overtime at night to make bearings for him. After six trials and revisions, it was finally successful. At present, the team has trial-produced more than ten kinds of tools, greatly improving labor efficiency. The team's pig inventory has increased from more than 4,000 last year to more than 6,000, saving 104 laborers and 46 livestock every day compared to the past. The number of pigs in the breeding pig farm has increased from 800 to 1,530, while the number of breeding and management personnel has decreased from 51 to 42.

    The great reform of pig-raising tools has created favorable conditions for the continued great development of pigs. Now, the team is continuing to vigorously carry out tool reform, planning to raise 30,000 pigs next year, achieving three pigs per mu of land, and achieving increased pigs without increasing labor.

    Xinhua News Agency reporter Hua Ai photographed Wu Jiapo Management District of Chengguan Commune in Fushan County, Shanxi Province, mobilizing the masses to reform tools, realizing the simple mechanization of pig raising tools. The district originally had 260 caretakers, and now only 67 are needed. This is the automatic flow of simply mechanically processed feed into the pig trough.

    天津幸福之路生产队大搞养猪技术革新
    养猪工具实现简易机械化
    多养猪  少用人
    一个饲养员二十分钟喂好二百头猪。全队圈存猪增加二千头，用于养猪的劳动力却减少一百零四人。
    据河北日报消息　天津市小站人民公社幸福之路生产队大力开展养猪工具技术革新运动，实现了猪饲料加工、喂猪过程简易机械化，每人由喂四十头猪增加到二百头。
    过去这个队的猪饲料加工厂里，成群结队的男女社员在铡草、切菜，起早恋晚紧干，还供不上猪吃。现在只有十几个人，用柴油机带动着自制的双筒粉碎机、铡草机、烘干器等工具作饲料加工，加工的饲料足足供应全队喂猪。在养猪工具革新以前，喂猪少、用人多，饲养员弄得满脚湿臭。现在每个饲养员站在圈外，只用二十分钟就把二百头猪喂好了。
    猪只增加以后，曾一度出现养猪和农业生产争夺劳动力的矛盾。光集体养猪就需要三百多个劳动力，占全队总劳动力的12％以上，再加上社员自己养猪，占用了不少整半劳动力。在这种情况下，有一些干部社员认为养猪不能再多了，再多就要影响农业生产。甚至有的小队干部把饲养员抽了去搞农业生产，大队种猪场向小队要饲养员，小队不愿意给，即使给了，一到农忙就又叫回去了。在猪饲料加工粉碎上也出了问题，需要加工粉碎的饲料很多，不能及时加工或加工粗糙，有的饲料只用锅一煮就喂，结果猪不爱吃，浪费很大。大队党总支分析了这些情况，认为解决养猪生产与农业生产争夺劳动力矛盾的唯一办法，是实现养猪生产的半机械化和机械化，目前应当集中力量先解决饲料加工和喂猪过程的半机械化和半自动化，作到多养猪、少用人。于是决定由党总支书记滕国华挂帅，总支委员陈德志具体负责领导，发动群众大搞养猪工具革新。
    党总支充分发动群众，以百折不挠的精神向困难作斗争。初期，有的干部和社员把工具革新看得很神秘，只想到外地买机器，或是让工人去搞。党总支针对这种思想，首先向饲养员、木工组、铁工组的工人，说明搞工具革新必须从土入手，就地制造，批判了各种错误思想，启发大家献策献计，很快把群众发动起来。大家一方面总结现有经验，进行仿制和改制，一方面创造新工具。大队工厂的刘金山、李凤云等到外地参观回来后，经过三天苦干深钻，仿制了一台木制双筒粉碎机，价值三十元，比买一台省一百七十多元。这台粉碎机一天能粉碎八千斤到一万斤饲料，比买的粉碎机效率还高两倍。对创制的新工具，党组织给以更多的帮助和支持。老场长杨万清打算利用轱辘马跑得快、扇车挡板能控制漏粮食多少的道理，制造一个半自动车槽联合喂猪器，党总支委员陈德志马上支持他的意见，和他一起试制，工厂厂长刘金山晚上加班给他作轴承。经过六次试制修改，终于成功了。目前，这队已经试制成十多种工具，大大提高了劳动效率。全队圈存猪由去年的四千多头增到六千多头，每天还比过去节约一百零四个劳动力和四十六头牲口。种猪场的猪只由八百头增到一千五百三十头，饲养和管理人员却由五十一人减到四十二人。
    养猪工具大改革，给猪只继续大发展创造了良好条件。现在这个队正继续大搞工具改革，明年要养猪三万头，达到一亩地三头猪，做到增猪不增人。（附图片）
