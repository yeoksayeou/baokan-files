    Huashi Commune Party Committee Cares for Reservoir Laborers
    Large Quantities of Rain Gear and Cotton Quilts Sent to Construction Site
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Huashi Commune Party Committee in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, has shown great concern for the well-being of the masses during the construction of the Huashi Reservoir project. As a result, the morale of over 10,000 laborers has remained high, and the attendance rate in the entire work area has increased from the original 80% to over 95%. Coupled with tool reforms, the average daily work efficiency per person has risen from the original 1.5 cubic meters to 5.7 cubic meters.
    The Huashi Reservoir is a large reservoir newly built in Xiangtan County this year. To accelerate the project's progress, the laborers seize every sunny day and work around the clock in shifts, but they also maintain a good balance between work and rest. The laborers have eight hours of sleep and three hours of rest each day. With the arrival of winter, the construction site Party committee made early arrangements for the laborers' winter living conditions. More than two hundred construction site canteens are well-managed, and cooks carry hot meals to the construction site. The fifteen residential buildings where the laborers live have been renovated and have windproof equipment added. The laborers' beds are thickly covered with straw. The construction site Party committee also arranged for over one hundred people to chop firewood and burn charcoal in nearby mountains. Recently, the commune's rear-area support team also transported more than six thousand pieces of rain gear and three thousand pieces of cotton clothing and quilts to ensure that laborers can work even on rainy days. Twenty-three doctors regularly patrol the construction site to provide medical care and strengthen disease prevention work at the construction site. The laborers eat well and sleep well, so everyone's morale is high, and everyone is full of energy, making the project progress faster day by day.

    大批雨具棉被送上工地
    本报讯　湖南省湘潭县花石公社党委会在修建花石水库工程中，十分关心群众生活，一万多民工一直情绪饱满，全工区出勤率已由原来的80％上升到95％以上。加上工具改革，每天平均每人工效由原来的一点五公方上升到五点七公方。
    花石水库是今年湘潭县新建的一个大水库。为了加快工程进度，民工们抓晴天，抢时间，日夜轮班干，但是劳逸结合得很好。每天民工有八小时睡眠和三小时休息。冬天来了，工地党委及早安排了民工过冬生活。两百多个工地食堂办得很好，炊事员挑着热腾腾的饭菜送到工地。民工住的十五栋民房，都经过整修，增加了挡风设备。民工的床铺都厚厚地铺上了稻草。工地党委还安排了一百多人在附近山上砍柴、烧木炭。最近，公社后方支援队还运来了六千多件雨具和三千多件棉衣、棉被，保证民工在雨天也能出工。二十三个医生又经常在工地巡回看病，加强工地疾病预防工作。民工们吃得好，睡得好，所以人人情绪饱满，个个干劲冲天，工程进度一天比一天快。
