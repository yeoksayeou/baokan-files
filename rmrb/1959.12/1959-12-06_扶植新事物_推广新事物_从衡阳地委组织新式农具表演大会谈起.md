Supporting New Things, Promoting New Things
From the Hengyang Prefectural Committee's New-Style Farm Implement Performance Conference
Shang Zhen
　　In early November, I participated in the Hengyang Prefectural Committee's district-wide competition of skilled operators of rice harvesters and threshing machines at Chetou Commune in Dao County. The new records created in this competition were:

　　Using a rice harvester to harvest two-fen of reasonably and densely planted paddy field in eight minutes and forty-seven seconds;

　　Using a threshing machine to thresh four-fen of reasonably and densely planted paddy field in thirteen minutes and forty-two seconds.

　　This practice of cultivating new forces, organizing skilled operators for touring performances, competitions, and technical instruction is a microcosm of the Hengyang Prefectural Committee's leadership in the farm implement reform movement. Since last year, Hu Yunchu, the first secretary of the Prefectural Committee, has personally presided over four district-wide conferences for training, performance, competition, and appraisal of new farm implements. At the same time, three performance teams were organized to conduct touring performances, competitions, and technical instruction. Subsequently, various counties also emulated this practice, organizing 15,000 professional teams using various new-style farm implements, forming a huge advanced force using new-style farm implements.

　　The invention and promotion of a new tool always results in three different attitudes among the masses: One type of person is the representative of new forces. They are eager to improve farm implements and hold a warm welcome attitude towards new farm implements. They wholeheartedly take the lead in studying technology, improving and enhancing new farm implements, actively spreading the word about the effectiveness of using them among the masses, and encouraging more people to learn and use them. These people are the locomotives of the farm implement reform movement, that is, the "seed hands." Another type of person, although they have the desire to reform farm implements, are somewhat conservative in their thinking and hold a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude towards new farm implements. When new farm implements encounter difficulties due to their imperfections or insufficient mastery of them in the initial stages of invention, they are prone to wavering and retreating. When some people use certain weaknesses of new farm implements to attack them, they are also prone to echoing them. However, after personally experiencing the benefits of new-style farm implements, they will also actively participate in the farm implement reform movement. The third type of person has more serious conservative thinking. They hold a resistant and opposing attitude towards the promotion of new farm implements, always feeling that old ways and old rules cannot be changed. They do not understand that the sickles currently in use, etc., also started from ancient times and have been shaped into their current form through countless inventions and improvements. Nor do they understand that all the tools currently in use are invented and created by the masses, starting from nothing and going through a process from incompleteness to gradual completeness; and that with the development of production, things that were originally complete will also appear backward and need to be reinvented and improved. Because they do not understand these things, they hold a discriminatory attitude towards new farm implements, often coming out to pick faults, spread an atmosphere of failure, and obstruct promotion. Only after a competition and personally experiencing the benefits of new farm implements will they admit defeat.

　　These three different attitudes reflect the struggle between the advanced and the backward, and also indirectly reflect the different class status and different levels of awareness of people in the countryside: Generally speaking, the first type of attitude is more common among Party members, League members, activists, young people, poor peasants, and new and old lower-middle peasants. This is because they hope to develop production at high speed and are eager to improve farm implements and increase labor productivity. The third type of attitude is generally more common among well-to-do middle peasants. This is because although they have the desire to develop production and improve their lives, they are not as eager as the three groups of people mentioned before. Many of them are skilled operators of old farm implements, satisfied with the status quo and not seeking improvement. Here, it reminds us of the story of someone racing a horse-drawn carriage against a train in the early days of the invention of the train. This can only be regarded as a laughing stock by later generations. Are the people who hold the third attitude in the farm implement reform not the same as the shortsighted coachmen who sit in a well and look at the sky?

　　These three types of people, like the growth of other new things, are gradually transforming. In the beginning, the second type of person always accounts for the majority. This is because the old-fashioned farm implements used by the vast number of peasants for thousands of years have accumulated experience and developed habits through generations of peasants using them day and night. There is a process of ideological understanding and mastering technology in clearing away habitual forces and establishing new things. However, farm implement reform means greatly increasing labor productivity, reducing labor intensity, and promoting the high-speed development of production and construction. This is the urgent demand of the masses and the location of the vital interests of the broad masses. The invention of new farm implements itself represents the strong desire of the masses. Therefore, although the superiority of new farm implements may not be understood by most people at the beginning, there will always be a group of advanced elements among the masses who welcome it and try their best to support its growth. They represent the truth, and their actions are in line with the general line and the spirit of the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, they have abundant vitality in them. Eventually, they will always overcome the old forces and continue to grow and develop. This is the force that should always be relied on in the development of the farm implement reform movement. Generally speaking, the attitude of those who hold the third type of attitude will change after education, criticism, and competition.

　　Not everyone has a deep understanding of the role of this new force and the law of movement development in the farm implement reform movement. Regarding this issue, three different attitudes can also be summarized among the vast number of cadres: One type of person, they are always concerned about the interests of the masses, understand the psychology and demands of the masses, and are therefore good at discovering the positive factors in the masses, and actively cultivate and support the activists in the movement with an enthusiastic attitude, so that they grow and develop. These cadres act as "gardeners" who sow seeds and cultivate seeds, and are the promoters of the farm implement reform movement. There is also another type of person, in some respects, they do not understand the demands of the masses and do not see the vitality of the positive factors and fresh things in the masses. Therefore, they are not concerned enough about the promotion of new farm implements, lack in-depth research, and do not actively support them. When encountering some temporary individual shortcomings and difficulties, or hearing some opposing opinions, they waver and retreat. In addition, there are a few people who are content with the status quo. No matter how beautiful they say it on the surface, their essence is to try their best to maintain the old things and oppose and exclude new things. Regarding the promotion of new farm implements, they hold a bourgeois master-style attitude, gesticulating and picking faults. Although many of them have not seen or used them, they "hear the wind and think it's rain" and still arbitrarily attack and obstruct them. These people are the demoters of the farm implement reform. Therefore, the first type of attitude needs to be greatly promoted, so that the second type of people can be educated and the third type of people can finally change their attitude.

　　The working methods of Hengyang tell us that in the farm implement reform movement, we must attach extreme importance to cultivating the growth of new forces. The promotion of a new farm implement, from budding, growing to being mastered by the broad masses, is full of complex and arduous struggles. Often in the early stages, the arrogance of the opponents will be very arrogant, and their arguments will easily mislead more people. From the superficial phenomenon, the new farm implement itself may not be perfect at the beginning, and there may not be many people supporting it among the masses. This requires us to have a calm mind, distinguish the most active factors in the masses, grasp it, and support it, so that it dares to fight against conservative thinking and strengthen itself in the struggle. The farm implement reform movement, like the past land reform movement, must be "rooted," and the most active "seeds" must be discovered in the masses, and various methods must be used to cultivate them so that they take root. Then, through them, the team can be expanded from point to surface. The Hengyang area has trained a large number of "seed hands" to promote new farm implements, which is a "rooting" method.

　　The experience of leading the farm implement reform movement in the Hengyang area tells us that in doing any revolutionary work and construction work, we must be good at discovering the positive factors in the work and rely on them to promote the entire work.

    扶植新事物　推广新事物
    从衡阳地委组织新式农具表演大会谈起
    尚真
    11月初，在道县车头公社参加了衡阳地委举办的全区割禾器、打谷机能手比武大会。这次比武创造的新纪录是：
    割禾器割合理密植的二分田是八分四十七秒；
    打谷机打合理密植的四分田是十三分四十二秒。
    这种培植新生力量，组织能手进行巡回表演、评比竞赛、传授技术的作法，是衡阳地委领导农具改革运动的一个缩影。去年以来，地委第一书记胡云初同志就曾亲自主持过四次全区性的训练、表演、竞赛、评比的新农具评比竞赛大会。同时组织了三个表演队，进行巡回表演比武，传授技术。以后各县也仿效了这种作法，组织了使用各种新式农具的专业队一万五千个，形成了一支巨大的使用新式农具的先进队伍。
    一件新工具的发明和推广，在群众中总是会出现这样三种不同态度的人：一种人，他们是新生力量的代表。他们迫切要求改进农具，对新农具抱着热烈欢迎的态度。他们满腔热情地带头钻研技术，改进和提高新农具，在群众中积极传播使用效果，促使更多的人来学它，用它。这些人，是农具改革运动中的火车头，也就是“种子手”。另一种人，他们虽然有改革农具的要求，但是思想上有些保守，对新农具抱着怀疑、观望的态度。当新农具在发明初期，由于不够完善或掌握不够熟练而遇到困难的时候，他们容易动摇、退缩。当有些人利用新农具的某些弱点进行攻击时，他们也容易随声附和。但当他们亲身体验了新式农具的好处以后，也会积极投入到农具改革运动中来。第三种人，保守思想比较严重。他们对新农具的推广抱着抵触与反对的情绪，总觉得老样子、老规矩不能改变。他们不懂得，现在使用的禾镰等等，也是从远古时代开始，经过不知多少次发明、改进才定型为现在这个样子的。也不懂得现在使用的一切工具，都是群众发明创造的，都是从无到有，都经过了由不完备到逐步完备的过程；而且随着生产的发展，原来完备的东西也会显得落后，又需要再发明，再改进。正由于他们不懂得这些，因而他们对新农具抱着歧视的态度，往往出来挑剔毛病，散布失败空气，阻挠推广。只有经过比赛，亲身体会到新农具的好处后，才会认输。
    这三种不同的态度，反映了先进和落后之间的斗争，也间接反映了农村中人们不同的阶级地位和不同的觉悟程度：持第一种态度的人，一般说来，党员、团员、积极分子、青年人、贫农、新老下中农较多。因为他们希望高速度发展生产，迫切要求改进农具，提高劳动生产率。持第三种态度的人，一般说来富裕中农所占的比重较大。因为他们虽有发展生产改善生活的要求，但不如三部分人迫切。他们中间不少的人是掌握旧农具的能手，满足现状，不求改进。在这里，使我们联想到在火车发明的初期，有人赶着马车和火车比赛的故事。这只能被后人作为笑谈。在农具改革中持第三种态度的人，不正是和当时的这个坐井观天、鼠目寸光的马车夫一样吗？
    这三种不同态度的人，和其他新生事物的生长一样，是在逐渐转化着的。在开初，第二种人总是占着多数。这是因为：广大农民千百年来所沿用的旧式农具，经过农民们祖祖辈辈日日夜夜地用它，已经积累了经验，也养成了习惯。清除习惯势力，树立新的东西，这中间有一段思想认识和掌握技术的过程。但是，农具改革，意味着大大提高劳动生产率，减轻劳动强度，促进生产建设高速度的发展。这是群众的迫切要求，也是广大群众切身利益的所在。新农具的发明，本身就代表了群众这种强烈的愿望。因此，虽然新农具的优越性开初不会为大多数人所了解，但是，在群众中总会涌现出一批先进分子，欢迎它。并且极力扶植它成长。他们代表着真理，他们的行动符合于总路线、大跃进的精神。因此，在他们身上蕴藏着充沛的生命力。最终总是要战胜陈旧的势力，不断成长和壮大起来的。这是农具改革运动发展中始终应该依靠的力量。对持第三种态度的人，经过教育批判、比赛以后，一般的说，态度是会转变过来的。
    农具改革运动中这种新生力量的作用和运动发展的规律，并不是所有的人都深刻认识了的。对于这个问题，在广大干部中也可以归纳成三种不同的态度：一种人，他们处处关心群众的利益，了解群众的心理和要求，因而善于发现群众中的积极因素，用热情的态度积极地培养扶植运动中的积极分子，使他们成长壮大。这类干部充当着撒播种子，培养种子的“园丁”，是农具改革运动中的促进派。还有一种人，在某些方面，他们理解不到群众的要求，看不到群众中的积极因素和新鲜事物充沛的生命力，因此，对于新农具的推广不够关心，缺乏深入钻研，不去积极支持。遇到一些暂时的个别的缺点和困难，或者听到一些反对意见，就动摇、退缩。此外，还有少数的人，他们安于现状。不管他们口头上说的多么动听，其实质是极力维护陈旧的东西，反对和排斥新鲜事物。对于新农具的推广，他们抱着资产阶级老爷式的态度，指手划脚，挑剔缺点。虽然有不少的他们还没有见过、用过，但他们“听见风，就是雨”，仍然任意攻击和阻挠。这些人是农具改革中的促退派。因此，第一种人的态度需要大大提倡，这样，就可以教育第二种人，使第三种人最后改变态度。
    衡阳的工作方法告诉我们，在农具改革运动中，必须极端重视培养新生力量的成长。一件新农具的推广，从萌芽、生长到为广大群众所掌握，中间充满着复杂艰巨的斗争。往往在初期，反对的人的气焰会很嚣张，他们的论调也会容易使比较多的人受到迷惑。从表面的现象上看，新农具的本身在开始时可能不够完善，群众中支持的人也可能不多，这就需要我们有冷静的头脑，分辨出群众中最积极的因素，抓住它、扶植它，使它勇于和保守思想作斗争，并且在斗争中壮大自己。农具改革运动也像过去土地改革运动一样必须“扎根”，要在群众中发现最积极的“种子”，用各种方法去培养他们，使他们生下根来，然后，再通过他们，由点到面，扩大队伍。衡阳地区训练出大批推广新农具的“种子手”，这正是一种“扎根”的办法。
    衡阳地区领导农具改革运动的经验告诉我们，做任何革命工作和建设工作，都必须善于发现工作中的积极因素，并且依靠着他们，去推动整个工作。
