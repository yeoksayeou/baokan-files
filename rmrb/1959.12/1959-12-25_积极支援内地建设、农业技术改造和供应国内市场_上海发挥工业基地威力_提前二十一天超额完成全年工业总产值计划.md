Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 24th. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, more than one million workers on Shanghai's industrial front resolutely implemented the Party's General Line for socialist construction and achieved a tremendous victory in continuing the Great Leap Forward of 1959 in a better and more comprehensive way.

According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Statistics, the city's industrial output value target set by the state has already been exceeded by 0.2% on December 10th, twenty-one days ahead of schedule. As of December 20th, among the 75 major products in the city listed in the national plan, the output of 51 products, including steel, steel products, coke, cement, heavy machinery, power machinery, metal cutting machine tools, power station boilers, steam turbines for power stations, turbine generators, transformers, automobile tires, antibiotics, printed and dyed fabrics, clocks, and soap, have either fulfilled or exceeded the annual state plan, and have shown significant growth compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The cumulative output as of December 20th increased more than twofold compared to the total output of last year for eight products including coke, calcium carbide, and sulfonamide drugs; more than doubled for seven products including power station boilers, cement, sulfuric acid, and antibiotics; more than 50% for seventeen products including steel, steel products, caustic soda, and clocks; and less than 50% for twenty-four products including heavy machinery, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, sewing machines, and paper.

This year, the quality of various major industrial products in Shanghai has generally improved, and costs have continued to decrease. The qualified rate of converter steel was 93.81% in March and reached 96.2% in October; the scrap rate of cast iron parts in the machinery industry was 8.29% in March and decreased to 5.99% in November; the standard product rate of cotton yarn in the textile industry was 99.45% in the highest month of last year, and has exceeded this level every month since August this year, reaching 99.96% in November, and by early December, 42 out of 44 cotton spinning mills had reached 100%. In light industrial products, the first-class product rate of enamel washbasins was 77.82% in March and rose to 87.98% in November; the first-class product rate of thermos bottle liners was 79.89% in March and rose to 82.92% in November; the repair rate of alarm clocks was 6.7% in March and has dropped to 2.2% in November.

In addition, Shanghai's industrial departments successfully trial-produced 19,312 new products and varieties in the first eleven months of this year, of which 10,205 have been officially put into production. The new products include advanced, precise, and major products such as 50,000 kW complete power station equipment, 220,000 volt 30,000 kVA three-winding large high-voltage transformers, 100,000x electron microscopes, and color movie film.

The tremendous victory of the continued comprehensive leap forward in 1959 has enabled Shanghai, as an industrial base, to exert even greater power. Since the beginning of this year, the quantity of various mechanical equipment that Shanghai has provided to support inland industrial construction and agricultural technology transformation has greatly exceeded that of previous years, and the daily-use industrial products needed to support the national market have also become more abundant.
