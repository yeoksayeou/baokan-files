Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 24th: After completing their annual total output value and tunneling plans twenty-three and twenty-seven days ahead of schedule, respectively, Kailuan Coal Mine also completed its annual raw coal production plan ahead of schedule on December 14th. As of the 14th, the mine's overall labor efficiency had increased by 0.17% compared to the annual plan, pit timber consumption per thousand tons was 0.95 cubic meters lower than planned, and the cost per ton of coal was one jiao lower than planned.

This year, the mine's Party Committee, in accordance with the spirit of the General Line, established the guiding ideology of pushing all work forward. The Party Committee used the method of mass movement, continuously overcoming various right-leaning conservative thoughts through big airing, big contending, and big debate. They established in the minds of all mine workers the idea of striving for the upper reaches without limit and inexhaustible production potential. As a result, a mass-based production upsurge quickly emerged in the first quarter, completing the quarterly production plan ahead of schedule. Since the second half of the year, production has also been increasing steadily. In particular, in September and October, the average daily production of raw coal increased by several thousand tons compared to the past.

When discussing and formulating production plans and measures for the next month at the end of each month, the Kailuan Coal Mine's mines, districts, shifts, and teams all deeply mobilized the masses for discussion, clarified the key to production, and then adopted the method of proposing topics and seizing the key to organize the masses to contribute ideas and solve key problems. In organizing competitions, they regularly checked the resolution of these key production issues and new problems that arose, and promptly summarized and promoted advanced experiences. This year, the mine not only widely promoted more than 130 types of advanced experiences from other places, but also summarized and promoted more than 100 types of effective experiences from its own mine.

Kailuan Coal Mine has been focusing on management work this year, grasping it tightly and meticulously. More than 60% of the leading cadres regularly go deep into the mine to participate in production and guide production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 24th: Huainan Coal Mine completed its annual production task seventeen days ahead of schedule. As of the 14th of this month, the raw coal plan was completed by 100.1%, overall labor efficiency was 8% higher than planned, costs were 11% lower than planned, pit timber consumption was 5% lower than planned, and tunneling footage exceeded the plan by 6%.

The Huainan Municipal Party Committee and the Coal Mine Party Committee this year led the Huainan Coal Mine workers to continuously overcome right-leaning laxity and effectively and meticulously organized sustained and balanced high production. For example, at the beginning of this year, they began to pay attention to overcoming the erroneous view that “the cycle of front-end slackness and back-end tightness is the 'norm' in coal mine production.” The Municipal Party Committee and the Mine Committee organized mass debates, refuted arguments such as "balance cannot achieve high output," and improved the understanding of the workers. Therefore, the output in March broke the one million ton mark, an increase of 300,000 tons compared to February. After the completion of the plan in the first half of the year, the new right-leaning slack mood was overcome in a short time in July, allowing the output to continue to rise. In the great battles of August and September, the daily output exceeded the 40,000-ton mark.

Huainan Coal Mine closely combined the movement to increase production and practice economy with technical innovation, reliably maintaining balanced and high production. They leveraged the wisdom of the masses, seizing several advanced technologies this year that were efficient, safe, and easy to implement, such as hydraulic coal mining, shield support coal mining, shallow mining multi-cycle operation, and the use of enamel chutes to replace chain conveyors. These were vigorously promoted throughout the mine, thereby ensuring the realization of the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results and safety.

### 煤海欢啸腾巨浪　矿工井下立大功  开滦淮南提前摘下全年跃进果

　　煤海欢啸腾巨浪　矿工井下立大功
    开滦淮南提前摘下全年跃进果
    据新华社天津24日电　开滦煤矿在提前二十三天和二十七天完成了今年总产值和掘进计划以后，在12月14日又提前完成了全年原煤产量计划。到14日止，这个矿的全员效率比年度计划提高0.17％，每千吨坑木消耗比计划降低零点九五立方米，吨煤成本比计划降低一角。
    今年以来，这个矿的党委会根据总路线的精神确定了一切工作往前赶的指导思想。党委运用群众运动的办法，通过大鸣大放大辩论，不断地克服各种右倾保守思想，在全矿职工中树立起力争上游无止境、生产潜力挖不尽的思想，因而在第一季度就迅速出现群众性的生产高潮，提前完成了季度生产计划。下半年以来，生产也是节节上升，特别是9、10月份，原煤平均日产量更比过去提高了几千吨。
    在月末讨论和制定下一月生产计划和措施的时候，开滦煤矿各矿、区、班、队都是深入地发动群众讨论，明确生产关键，然后采取提课题抢关键的方法，组织群众献计献策，解决关键问题。他们在组织比赛中，经常检查这些生产关键问题的解决情况和出现的新问题，抓紧总结和推广先进经验。今年以来，全矿不仅普遍推广了外地的一百三十多种先进经验，同时总结推广了本矿行之有效的经验一百多种。
    开滦煤矿今年管理工作抓得紧，抓得细。60％以上的领导干部经常深入井下，参加生产指导生产。
    据新华社合肥24日电　淮南煤矿提前十七天完成了年度生产任务。到本月14日止，原煤计划完成100.1％，全员效率比计划提高8％，成本比计划降低11％，坑木消耗比计划降低5％，掘进进尺超过计划6％。
    中共淮南市委和煤矿党委今年领导淮南煤矿职工不断克服右倾松劲情绪，有效地细致地组织了持久的均衡高产。例如今年年初，他们就开始注意克服前松后紧是煤矿生产循环不已的“常规”这种错误观点。市委和矿委组织群众辩论，驳斥了“均衡不能高产”等的论调，提高了职工群众的认识。因此，3月份产量即突破百万吨大关，比2月份增加了三十万吨。上半年计划完成以后，7月份在很短时间内克服新的右倾松劲情绪，使产量继续上升。大战8、9月，更突破了日产四万吨关。
    淮南煤矿把增产节约运动同技术革新紧密结合起来，可靠地保持均衡高产。他们发挥群众智慧，在今年抓住了几项效率高、安全好、简单易行的先进技术，例如水力采煤法，掩护支架采煤法，浅采多循环作业法，使用搪瓷溜子代替链板运输机等，在全矿大力推广，从而保证实现了多快好省和安全的要求。
