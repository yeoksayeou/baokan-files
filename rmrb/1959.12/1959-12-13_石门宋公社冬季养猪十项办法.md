The Shimen Song People's Commune in Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, famous for pig raising, has adopted ten measures to ensure the safe wintering of pigs. These ten measures are: (1) Universally dig underground cellars in all pigsties. The depth of the cellars should be such that the pigs can lie in them. The bottom of the cellars should be covered with dry sand, and the three sides should be piled up with firewood and covered to ensure that the pigsty is warm. (2) In order to allow pigs to eat warm food and reduce body temperature consumption, fields, teams, and households should universally establish warm pots, warm tanks, and warm jars, and process and prepare feed so that pigs like to eat and eat their fill. (3) To prevent pigs from developing skin diseases, frequently pad the pigsty with dry soil to avoid dampness in the pigsty and on the pig's body. (4) Do not allow pigs to eat human manure and urine or other things containing ascarid eggs. If ascarids are found in pigs, they should be treated immediately. (5) Piglets born in severe winter should be placed in baskets with wheat straw after birth, covered with quilts, and moved to the kitchen or greenhouse. (6) Thin and sick pigs should be classified and lined up, and fed by special personnel, taking measures to add vegetables, add feed, and increase the number of feedings to quickly restore their health. (7) In addition to disinfecting the walls of the pigsty with lime, the pen should be swept frequently and the soil should be padded frequently to keep the pigsty clean and dry at all times. (8) Fat pigs, castrated pigs, and empty sows should be kept together with sheep, which has the benefit of keeping them warm. (9) Implement a reward and punishment system. (10) Implement an inspection and evaluation system. (Shimen Song Commune Office, Shou Zhang County Party Committee Multi-Economic Office)
