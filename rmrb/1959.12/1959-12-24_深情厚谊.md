　　Profound Friendship
　　By Our Reporter Cheng Min
　　In the Longshan Production Team of the Baique Commune in Wuxing County, whenever the mechanized and electrified silkworm rearing cooperative is mentioned, the commune members are filled with gratitude, speaking highly of the support given by the workers of the Huzhou Silk Factory. Indeed, how can such profound friendship be forgotten? The old silkworm farmers who have used old handicrafts to raise silkworms in silkworm houses for generations, how can they not be moved from the bottom of their hearts when they start using machines?
　　The members of the Longshan Team value this noble friendship very much. They send the best rice straw to the silk factory, and they raise pigs, raise fish, and engage in mulberry garden experimental fields together with the silk factory. Many commune members have established very close friendships with the silk factory workers. In mid-November, Wang Renhe, a Communist Party member and electrician from the silk factory, came to the Longshan Team to help install electrical equipment for the cooperative rearing room. In just a few days, the commune members became very familiar with him, and everyone affectionately called him Lao Wang. Lao Wang is an electrician from a peasant background, and he was so excited to help the Longshan Production Team with mechanized and electrified silkworm rearing this time. He clearly remembered how hard his family used to cut mulberry leaves by hand, knife by knife, under the dim oil lamp! Now silkworm rearing can use electric lights, and mulberry cutting can use machines, how can he not be as excited as the commune members? In order to get the silkworm house illuminated by electric lights as soon as possible, he rushed to install them overnight, and the wind and rain could not stop him. He also told the commune members in detail about the common sense of using electricity. Production team leaders Wang Jinlin and Shen Bingrong said gratefully to Wang Renhe: "You worker elder brothers are really great. This time, we rely entirely on your help to use electricity and machines to raise silkworms." Wang Renhe always said very modestly: "Workers and peasants are one family. Our silk factory's raw materials also rely entirely on the support of the peasants. We work hand in hand to build socialism, and in the future, we will all become workers using machines."
　　Wang Renhe also told everyone about the great leap forward achievements in the silk factory, the workers' enthusiasm, engaging in competitions, and making innovations. Old commune member Shen Bingrong listened and thought: The worker elder brothers really have good ideas and high skills, and everything is worth learning from us peasants. He immediately said to Wang Renhe: "We peasants must learn from the worker elder brothers and do a good job in production." Shen Bingrong often invited Wang Renhe to sit in his home; whenever it rained, he would send his own umbrella and rain boots to him; and sometimes he would let him stay overnight in his team.
　　The members of the Longshan Team of the Baique Commune and the workers of the Huzhou Silk Factory help and promote each other in this way.

　　深情厚谊
    本报记者　程敏
    在吴兴县白雀公社龙山生产队，只要一提起机械化电气化养蚕共育室，社员们没有一个不怀着感激的心情，大谈湖州丝厂工人们给予的支援。的确，这种深情厚谊怎么能令人忘掉呢？世世代代用旧手工在蚕室养蚕的老蚕农，一旦使上了机器，怎能不从心坎里感动呢？
    龙山队的社员们非常重视这种高贵的友谊，他们把最好的稻草送给丝厂，他们和丝厂共同养猪、养鱼、搞桑园试验田。许多社员和丝厂工人建立了十分亲密的友谊。11月中旬丝厂电工共产党员王仁和，到龙山队来帮助共育室装电气设备，只有几天，社员就和他混得很熟了，大家都亲热地叫他老王。老王是一个农民出身的电工，这次帮助龙山生产队搞养蚕机械化电气化，他是那样的兴奋。他清楚地记得，过去自己家里人在半暗半明的油灯下，用手一刀刀切桑叶，多么辛苦啊！如今养蚕可用电灯了，切桑可用机器了，叫他怎能不和社员一样兴奋呢？他为了使蚕室早些有电灯照明，连夜赶装，狂风大雨也阻不住他，他还把用电的常识详细告诉社员们。生产队长王金林、沈炳荣感激地对王仁和说：“你们工人老大哥真伟大，这次全靠你们帮助，我们才能用电用机器养蚕。”王仁和总是很谦逊地说：“工人农民是一家，我们丝厂的原料也全靠农民支援，我们手拉手地共同建设社会主义，到将来，我们都成为一样用机器的工人了。”
    王仁和还把丝厂里生产大跃进的成绩，工人的干劲，搞竞赛，闹革新等讲给大家听。老社员沈炳荣一边听一边想：工人老大哥真是思想好，本领高，样样值得我们农民好好学习。他立即对王仁和说：“我们农民一定要向工人老大哥学习，搞好生产。沈炳荣还常常请王仁和到他家里去坐坐；逢到下雨，就把自己的雨伞雨鞋送去给他；有时还留他在自己队里宿夜。
    白雀公社龙山队的社员和湖州丝厂工人就是这样互相帮助互相促进的。
