Do a Good Job of Grain Distribution, Conservation, and Storage

This year's agricultural production, after overcoming severe natural disasters unseen in decades, has achieved another bumper harvest. Every grain is the fruit of the People's Commune members' hard work and heroic struggle. Our current task is to conscientiously do a good job of grain distribution, conservation, and storage.

Doing a good job of comprehensive grain distribution is a major event. This matter is related to the development of the entire national economic construction and the arrangement of the lives of the people throughout the country. In order to do a good job of comprehensive grain distribution, it is necessary, in accordance with the spirit of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, to take into account both the needs of national construction and the needs of communes and production teams to develop production and the lives of their members. On the one hand, we must actively fulfill and strive to overfulfill the state's grain procurement tasks. On the other hand, we must reserve sufficient seeds and feed according to the needs of next year's production development, reserve sufficient food rations for commune members according to national quantitative standards, and reserve a portion of grain for storage. At present, many People's Communes, while completing the state's grain procurement tasks, are focusing on grain work. After full deliberation and democratic discussion among their members, they have formulated distribution plans and made reasonable allocations and proper arrangements for seeds, feed, food rations, and stored grain, thus greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of commune members for labor production and throwing themselves into winter production with full energy. For example, the Wujianwu Production Team of the Dongcun People's Commune in Haiyang County, Shandong Province, decided after democratic discussion among its members that out of the 1,374,414 jin of grain harvested this year (estimated yield), the state would procure 230,000 jin, accounting for 16.7% of the total yield; 112,984 jin would be reserved for seeds (an average of 43 jin per mu), accounting for 8.2% of the total yield; 63,450 jin would be reserved for feed, accounting for 4.6% of the total yield; 678,470 jin would be reserved for food rations, accounting for 49.4% of the total yield (half grain and half sweet potato); and 289,510 jin would be stored as reserve grain (including some incentive grain), accounting for 21.1% of the total yield. After the announcement of this plan and the wage distribution plan, all members of the team were satisfied, greatly promoting the current production. The facts of the Wujianwu Production Team show that People's Communes in various places greatly need to focus on grain distribution work. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, in accordance with the spirit of overall planning, to properly arrange the food rations, seeds, and feed grain of the production teams. The Wujianwu Production Team did this and achieved good results. It is necessary for every production team in the country to do so. According to reports from some areas, a small number of production teams believe that this year's grain harvest is a bumper harvest and have relaxed the comprehensive arrangement of grain. Due attention must be paid to this situation. The county party committees and commune party committees in various places should help these production teams do a good job in grain distribution and ensure that the production teams' food rations, seeds, and feed are arranged one by one before the new grain is on the market next year.

After doing a good job in distribution, it is also necessary to manage the food rations well and let everyone eat well, so that the lives of the commune members are truly arranged well. Managing well and eating well means both conserving grain and ensuring that commune members eat well and eat their fill. The key lies in implementing planned grain consumption and improving grain processing and consumption methods to increase the yield of rice (flour) and the rate of cooked rice. At present, some people have the idea that since the grain harvest is a bumper harvest, they should eat as much as possible. Obviously, this idea is incorrect. It is possible and necessary to appropriately improve life after a bumper grain harvest. However, the improvement of life must be subordinate to the development of production and must be gradually improved. Moreover, a portion of the grain should be taken out as feed for livestock and as reserve grain for communes and teams. Therefore, after a bumper harvest, we should still pay attention to conservation, so that there is room for maneuver, and life will get better and better. After a bumper harvest, the implementation of planned grain consumption can achieve a steady flow, supplement deficiencies with surpluses, and ensure that life is guaranteed under any circumstances.

The implementation of planned grain consumption is to eat enough and eat well, not only for the present but also for the future to be able to eat enough and eat well. To achieve the goal of eating enough, eating well, and eating economically, it is necessary to have a plan for consumption during busy and slack seasons, to properly adjust the dry and the liquid, to properly match the refined and coarse grains, and to fully utilize the nutrients of the grain, and so on. Therefore, all localities should properly arrange the lives of commune members and fully implement the system of planned grain consumption and economical grain consumption.

In terms of improving grain processing methods and cooking methods, various localities have made some creations. For example, the method created by the Santaizi sideline team of the Weixing Commune in Heishan County, Liaoning Province, of first boiling corn (maize), then grinding it finely, and then using the ground soup noodles to steam pancakes or cornbread, is a good method. With this method, one jin of corn flour can increase the rate of cooked rice by 50% to 80%, and the food made with this method is varied, delicious, fragrant, and resistant to hunger. The Lingqian Production Team of the Liuqu Commune in Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province, created a grain processing method to improve the flour yield. The method is: first clean up the grain, mix it with water evenly, put it aside for a day, and then grind it the next day, so that more flour and whiter flour can be produced. One hundred jin of wheat can produce one hundred jin of flour. From the experience of the Santaizi sideline team of the Weixing Commune in Heishan County and the Lingqian Production Team of the Liuqu Commune in Tongchuan City, it can be seen that the potential for improving the yield of rice (flour) and the rate of cooked rice from grain processing is great. As long as everyone uses their brains, they will definitely be able to create more and better scientific grain processing methods and consumption methods.

When communes and production teams properly arrange production and the lives of their members, they should reserve a certain amount of stored grain in accordance with the spirit of "looking ahead and behind, supplementing deficiencies with surpluses" and "careful calculation and leaving a reserve." Why should we keep reserve grain? Because disasters such as water, drought, and pests may affect agricultural harvests at any time before we can completely conquer them. Like this year, more than a dozen provinces and regions across the country have suffered droughts and floods unseen in decades. Under such circumstances, having a certain amount of reserve grain can guarantee people's normal living needs. At the same time, it should also be seen that our country is a "poor and blank" country. Since liberation, although agricultural production has made great progress and people's lives have gradually improved, the need for grain has increased accordingly due to the increasing development of national construction and the increasing improvement of people's lives, and grain is still not abundant. Therefore, both the state, communes, production teams, and individual commune members should have a certain amount of reserve grain. Storing grain to prepare for famine is a fine traditional habit of our people. Many communes have stored a certain amount of grain and have won the heartfelt support of their members. For example, since the beginning of the autumn harvest, the Lianyuan County in Hunan Province has led its communes to widely educate their members on diligence and thrift and keeping reserves, reasonably distributed the bumper grain harvest, and properly arranged the lives of their members. Therefore, after deducting the state's grain procurement, seeds, feed, and food rations for commune members, the amount of reserve grain that had been put into storage throughout the county by the beginning of October reached more than 74 million jin, with reserves in every canteen and surpluses in every household. In order to properly store the reserve grain, the county has prepared 1,100 main grain storage warehouses and 32,000 miscellaneous grain storage warehouses, and has also selected 8,600 people to be specially responsible for storage, and has formulated various systems for storage and inspection. This is worth emulating by all localities.

Grain is the "treasure of treasures." Doing a good job of grain arrangement is of great importance and must not be taken lightly. All localities should, in accordance with the spirit of the "Resolution on Launching the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy" of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, make proper overall arrangements for grain and conscientiously achieve good sales, good distribution, good storage, and good use. We must treat grain distribution, conservation, and storage as a major event, and through this work, further mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses for production and prepare for continued leaps forward next year.

### 做好粮食的分配、节约和储备

    做好粮食的分配、节约和储备
    今年农业生产在战胜了数十年未有的严重的自然灾害以后，又获得了丰收。每一颗粮，都是人民公社的社员们辛勤劳动和英勇斗争的果实。我们当前的任务就是要认真做好粮食的分配、节约和储备。
    做好全面的粮食分配工作，是一件大事。这件事情关系到国家整个经济建设的发展和全国人民生活的安排。为了做好全面的粮食分配工作，必须根据统筹安排、全面照顾的精神，既照顾到国家建设的需要，又照顾到公社、生产队发展生产和社员生活的需要。一方面要积极完成和力争超额完成国家征购粮食的任务，另一方面，要根据明年生产发展的需要留足种子、饲料和按照国家定量标准留足社员口粮，还要留一部分储备粮。目前，许多人民公社在完成国家征购粮食的任务的同时，大抓粮食工作，他们经过社员充分酝酿、民主讨论制定分配方案，对种子、饲料、口粮和储备粮，都作了合理的分配和妥善的安排，因而大大鼓舞了社员劳动生产的积极性，干劲十足地投入冬季生产。如山东海阳县东村人民公社五间屋生产队，经过社员民主讨论决定：在今年收获的一百三十七万四千四百一十四斤粮食中（估产），国家征购二十三万斤，占总产量的16.7％；留种十一万二千九百八十四斤（每亩平均四十三斤），占总产量的8.2％；留饲料六万三千四百五十斤，占总产量的4.6％；留口粮六十七万八千四百七十斤，占总产量的49.4％（粮薯各半）；储备粮二十八万九千五百一十斤
  （内有部分奖励粮），占总产量的21.1％。这个方案和工资部分的分配方案公布以后，全队社员人人满意，大大推动了当前生产。五间屋生产队的事实说明，各地人民公社很需要大抓一下粮食分配的工作。必须按照统筹安排的精神，充分发动群众，依靠群众，把生产队的口粮、种子、饲料用粮妥当地安排好。五间屋生产队这样做了，效果很好。全国每一个生产队都有必要这样做。根据一些地区反映。有少数生产队认为今年粮食丰收，就放松了对粮食的全面安排。对于这种情况必须给予应有的重视。各地县委和公社党委要帮助这些生产队作好粮食分配的工作，务必把生产队在明年新粮登场以前的口粮、种子、饲料一一安排好。
    在做好分配工作以后，还要把口粮管好、让大家吃好，这才算真正把社员的生活安排好了。管好、吃好，就是既要节约粮食，又要使社员吃得好、吃得饱。关键就在于实行计划用粮，和改进粮食加工、食用方法，提高出米（粉）率和出饭率。目前，在一部分人中有这样一种想法，认为：粮食丰收了，就应该尽量多吃。显然，这种想法是不正确的。粮食丰收了，适当地改善一下生活是可以的，也是必要的。但是，生活的改善必须服从生产的发展，必须逐步改善。而且还应该拿出一部分粮食作为家畜的饲料和社、队的储备粮食。所以丰收以后仍旧要注意节约，这样留有余地，日子就越过越好过。丰收以后，实行计划用粮，就可以做到细水长流，以丰补歉，作到在任何情况下，生活都有保证。
    实行计划用粮，就是为了吃饱吃好，不但为了眼前，而且为了以后也能够吃饱吃好。要达到吃得饱吃得好又吃得省的目的，就要做到农忙、农闲消费有计划，干稀适当调剂，细粮粗粮搭配适当，粮食养分充分利用等等。因此，各地要妥善地安排社员生活；全面实行计划用粮和节约用粮的制度。
    在改进粮食加工方法和做饭方法方面，各地已有一些创造。如辽宁黑山县卫星公社三台子副业队创造的苞米（玉米）先煮一煮，然后磨细，再用磨成的汤子面蒸饼子或窝窝头的办法，就是一个好办法。用这种办法一斤苞米面可提高出饭率50％到80％，而且用这种办法制出的食品花样多、好吃、味香、耐饥。陕西铜川市流曲公社陵前生产队，创造了一个提高出粉率的粮食加工办法。这个办法是：先把粮食拾掇干净，水拌均匀，拌上后先放上一天，第二天再上磨，这就可以出粉多，出粉白。每百斤小麦可出一百斤面。从黑山县卫星公社三台子副业队和铜川市流曲公社陵前生产队的经验可以看出，提高粮食加工出米（粉）率和出饭率的潜力很大，只要大家开动脑筋，就一定可以创造更多更好的科学的粮食加工方法和食用方法。
    公社和生产队在妥善安排生产和社员生活的时候，应当根据“瞻前顾后，以丰补歉”、“精打细算、留有后备”的精神，留出一定的储备粮。为什么要留储备粮？因为水、旱、病虫等灾害在我们还未能完全征服以前，随时都可能影响农业的收成。像今年，全国就有十几个省区遭受了数十年未有的旱涝灾害。在这种情况下，有一定的储备粮，就能保证人们正常生活的需要。同时，还应当看到，我国是一个“一穷二白”的国家，解放后，虽然农业生产已有很大的发展，人民生活已逐步改善，但是，由于国家建设日益发展与人民生活日益提高，对粮食的需要也相应增大，粮食仍然不算宽裕。因此，不论是国家、公社、生产队和社员个人，都应当有一定的储备粮。储粮备荒，这是我国人民优良的传统习惯。许多公社储备了一定数量的粮食，得到了社员的衷心拥护。如湖南涟源县从秋收开始，县委就领导各公社在社员中广泛进行了勤俭节约、留有后备的教育，合理分配了丰收的粮食，妥善安排了社员生活。因此，在扣除国家征购粮食、种子、饲料和社员口粮以后，到10月上旬止全县已入库的储备粮就达到七千四百多万斤，个个食堂有储备，户户社员有节余。为了把储备粮保管好，全县已准备了一千一百个主粮储备仓库，三万二千个杂粮储备仓库，还挑选了八千六百人专门负责保管，并制定了保管检查的各种制度。这是值得各地效法的。
    粮食是“宝中之宝”，做好粮食安排工作，关系十分重大，决不能等闲视之。各地应当根据党的八届八中全会“关于开展增产节约运动的决议”的精神，把粮食加以妥善的统筹安排，认真做到交售好、分配好、保管好、用好。必须把粮食分配、节约和储备工作当作一件大事去作，并且要通过这一工作进一步调动群众生产的积极性，为明年的继续跃进作准备。
