Yuejin Commune Uses Eight Methods to Process 150 Kinds of Feed, Broadening the Source of Pig Feed

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, December 8th) The Yuejin Commune in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, broke with convention this year and developed over 150 kinds of feed for pigs, doubling the number of pigs raised and greatly improving their quality.

Historically, very few pigs were raised in the Yuejin Commune area. Mass pig farming began last year, but the number and quality of pigs were affected because the feed problem was not solved. Some pigs had large heads and small bodies, and their weight gain was slow. Therefore, a specious argument circulated among the masses: raising pigs without feed is worse than not raising them at all. After communization, the commune relied on its own efforts to broaden feed sources, turning scarcity into abundance, and a new look appeared in the pig-raising industry. The entire commune raises more than 8,000 pigs, doubling the number compared to 1958. The average household has 1.1 pigs in the pen, breaking through the annual plan of one pig per household. So far, the commune has overfulfilled the state's pig procurement task by 41%. Due to sufficient feed and improved feeding management techniques, the pigs are generally fat and fleshy. 70% of the pigs reach 100 to 150 jin in weight in eight months. More than 20 pigs grew from 30 jin to 160 jin in more than four months, an average gain of more than one jin per day. The average number of piglets produced by sows in the entire commune is one-third more than in previous years, and the new piglets rarely die. This year, the commune not only did not need more feed, but also saved all the 500,000 jin of grain left over for pig feed in the entire commune.

The Yuejin Commune adopted a two-pronged approach to solve the pig feed problem through self-reliance: on the one hand, the entire commune established more than 800 mu of pig feed planting bases; on the other hand, it made use of agricultural by-products, wild vegetables, weeds, tree leaves, etc. locally, and processed them to provide more than 150 kinds of feed sources for pigs. Different processing methods are adopted according to different raw materials, which can be summarized as: frying, drying, chopping, steaming, grinding, milling, pickling, and fermenting.

1.  Frying: This method is used for all hard raw materials, such as sorghum husks, millet husks, wheat husks, corn cobs, and wormwood and artemisia with seeds and flavor. After being fried until crispy, it is easy to crush into powder, and it also produces an oily fragrance that pigs like to eat. Some grasses and leaves can also remove their peculiar smell after frying.

2.  Drying: Collect wild grasses and vegetables suitable for feed, such as fennel grass, evergreens, sweet sow thistle, and bitter sow thistle, wash them, and dry them for easy storage.

3.  Chopping: Use a chaff cutter to chop yam vines, melon vines, grass vines, and corn and millet seedlings thinned out from the fields into one-inch lengths, or dry them in the sun and then grind them into powder, or pickle or ferment them in jars.

4.  Steaming: Steam, simmer, and crush radish tops, vegetable roots, grass roots, beet pulp after sugar making, etc., and mix them with other feeds to feed pigs.

5.  Grinding: This method is used for all raw materials that can be ground into powder, such as fried crop straws and cotton shells. It is easy to store and pigs love to eat it.

6.  Milling: Grind fried corn cobs, sunflower discs, sorghum husks, millet husks, etc. into powder, which is a good concentrated feed.

7.  Pickling: Such as taro leaves, mustard greens, and substandard tubers that people do not eat, put a small amount of salt on them and pickle them in jars for long-term preservation. They also have a salty and sour taste, which can adjust the pig's appetite.

8.  Fermenting: This method is mainly used to process multi-leaf grasses, vegetables, and tree leaves. Wash them, chop them, put them in a jar, add one jin of salt for every hundred jin, press them firmly with stones, pour water on them (submerge the leaves), and expose them to the sun for about seven days to make fermented feed. This feed can be stored for three to four months.

According to the analysis of these feeds by the Shanxi Provincial Science Department, some can replace concentrated feed, and some are better roughage. For example, fennel grass contains up to 23.2% protein and 2.9% fat. Sunflower discs and corn cobs all contain a certain amount of protein, fat, and fiber. Since the Yuejin Commune promoted these methods in April, in addition to fully ensuring the daily needs of pig feeding, it has also stored more than 1,000 sacks of feed powder, 50 warehouses of dried vegetables and other dry feeds, 21 cellars of silage, and 840 jars of pickled and fermented feeds, enough for the existing pigs to eat for half a year.

The Yuejin Commune experienced many twists and turns and difficulties in developing feed sources. The commune party committee concentrated the commune's technical talents to conduct experiments in the Beigui, Chengzhao, and Fenggu management areas first. After gaining experience, it organized visits to break through the masses' ideological barriers. During the promotion, there was a conflict between time and labor. After the commune made unified arrangements, it adopted a method of doing small-scale work during busy farming seasons and large-scale work during slack farming seasons, combining concentrated efforts with year-round work, breaking through the labor barrier. The commune established a large-scale pig feed processing plant to process more complex feeds; each production team established 50 small processing plants to process simple feeds; and mobilized commune members' families to collect and process feeds sporadically through the method of assigning tasks, setting quality standards, determining varieties, and setting remuneration. The commune also organized a pig feed technical team, focusing on training 25 professional talents; and organized a group of commune members to visit the Shanxi Agricultural College to learn how to make feed. In this way, the technical level was continuously improved, and the technical barrier was overcome. Finally, the most troublesome difficulty was encountered - after many feeds were produced in large quantities, the pigs initially ate very vigorously, but gradually stopped liking them. To overcome this difficulty, six cadres of the commune, together with the cadres of the management area, went deep into the pigpens to observe the pigs' feeding situation at all times, discussed with the breeders on the spot, and improved the feeding methods. More than 150 kinds of feed were made into various mixed feeds. This feed had a sour, salty, and oily fragrance, and when necessary, some refined flour was added to greatly stimulate the pigs' appetite.

    养猪饲料来源广阔跃
    进公社用八种方法加工一百五十多种饲料
    本报太原8日电　山西太谷县跃进公社，今年打破常规，为猪开辟了一百五十多种饲料，养猪数量翻了一番，猪的质量大大提高。
    跃进公社一带历史上很少养猪，去年开始大量养猪，但由于饲料没有得到解决，养猪数量和质量都受到影响。有些猪头大身小、增重缓慢，因此在群众中间流传着一种似是而非的说法：养猪没饲料，不如不养猪。公社化后，公社自力更生广开饲料来源，由不足变有余，养猪事业出现了新的面貌。全公社养猪八千多口，比1958年翻了一番，圈存猪平均每户一点一口，突破了一户一口的年度计划。到目前为止已超额41％完成了国家收购猪的任务。由于饲料充足，加以改进饲养管理技术，猪普遍膘肥肉满，70％的猪八个月达到一百至一百五十斤重。有二十多口猪四个多月期间由三十斤长到一百六十斤，一天平均长一斤多。全公社母猪平均比往年多产仔三分之一，新繁殖的小猪也很少死亡。今年这个公社非但没有再要饲料，并且把全公社留下的五十多万斤猪饲料粮食，全部节省下来。
    跃进公社采取了两条腿走路的办法，自力更生解决猪饲料问题：一方面全公社建立了八百多亩猪饲料种植基地；另一方面是就地利用农作物副产品、野菜、野草、树叶等，经过加工，为猪提供了一百五十多种饲料来源。根据不同的原料采取不同的加工方法，总起来是：炒、晒、切、蒸、碾、磨、腌、沤八种。
    一、炒，凡是硬性的原料，如高粱壳、谷子壳、麦壳、玉米轴心、带籽有味的艾草、蒿草等，都用此法。经过上火炒脆，便于破碎制粉，同时产生油香味，猪喜爱吃。有的草、叶经过炒，还可去掉邪味。
    二、晒，采集适宜作饲料的野草野菜，如茴茴草、老来青草、甜苣菜、苦苣菜等，洗净晒干，便于贮存。
    三、切，把山药蛋蔓、瓜蔓、草蔓和田间间出的玉米、谷子幼苗，用铡刀切成一寸长，或晒干后碾、磨制粉，或入缸腌、沤。
    四、蒸，把萝卜顶、菜根、草根、制糖后的甜菜渣子等蒸焖、搅碎，与其它饲料掺拌喂猪。
    五、碾，凡是能够碾压成粉的原料，如经过炒的作物秸秆、棉壳等都采取这种办法，既好保存，猪又爱吃。
    六、磨，把炒过的玉米轴心、葵花盘、高粱壳、谷子壳等，磨成粉，是好精饲料。
    七、腌，如芋头菜、芥菜以及人不吃的残次块茎菜，放上少量的盐，用缸腌起来，能长期保存，同时有咸酸味，可以调剂猪的胃口。
    八、沤，这种办法主要是处理多叶草、菜及树叶等，洗净切碎，放在缸里，每百斤加上一斤盐，用石块压实，倒上水（淹住叶子），用阳光晒七天左右即可成发酵饲料。这种饲料能贮存三、四个月。
    据山西省科学部门对这些饲料的分析，有的可代精饲料，有的是较好的粗饲料。如茴茴草含蛋白质达23.2％，脂肪达2.9％。葵花盘、玉米轴心都含有一定量蛋白质、脂肪和纤维。跃进公社从4月份推广这些办法以后，除充分地保证了日常喂猪需要外，并储存了饲料粉一千多麻袋，干菜等干饲料五十仓库，青贮饲料二十一窖，腌、沤饲料八百四十缸，够现有猪半年食用。
    跃进公社开辟饲料来源经历了许多波折和难关。公社党委集中全社技术人才先在北圭、城赵，丰固管理区进行试验，取得经验后，组织参观才突破了群众的思想关；在推广时发生了时间与劳力的矛盾，经过公社统一安排，采取了农忙小搞农闲大搞，突击与常年搞相结合的办法，突破了劳力关。公社建立了一个大型猪饲料加工厂，加工比较复杂的；各生产队建立了五十个小加工厂，加工简易的；通过定任务定质量定品种定报酬的办法发动社员家庭零星采集加工。公社还组织了猪饲料技术小组，重点培养了二十五个专业人材；并组织一批社员到山西农学院参观学习制作饲料的办法。这样不断地提高技术水平，攻下了技术关。最后，遇到了一个最为棘手的难关——许多饲料大批生产以后，猪起先吃的很凶，后来逐渐不爱吃了。为了攻这一关，公社六个干部协同管理区干部，时时刻刻深入猪圈观察猪吃饲料的情况，和饲养人员现场讨论，改进配料方法，一百五十多种饲料制成各种混合饲料，这种饲料有酸味咸味还有些油香气，必要时加些调和面，大大刺激了猪的食欲。
