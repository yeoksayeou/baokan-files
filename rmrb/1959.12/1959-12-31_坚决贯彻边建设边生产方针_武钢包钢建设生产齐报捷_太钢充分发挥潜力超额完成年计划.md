Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 30th: Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation has completed its basic construction and production plans for this year ahead of schedule.

This iron and steel complex had eighty projects completed and put into production this year. The annual basic construction investment plan was overfulfilled by 11% forty-one days ahead of schedule, and basic construction costs were reduced by 16.68%. All major projects were built quickly and well.

The production plans for the four major products—steel, iron, coke, and ore—and more than ten kinds of subsidiary products were all overfulfilled by December 22nd.

This year, in its construction, Wuhan Iron and Steel implemented political command, launched mass movements, and fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of its workers, overcoming various difficulties. Many company Party secretaries, managers, and other leading cadres went to key projects such as open-hearth furnaces, rolling mills, blast furnaces, and sintering plants to participate in labor; they consulted with workers on matters, discussed plans together, and researched measures, greatly inspiring the workers' labor enthusiasm.

In construction, Wuhan Iron and Steel fully utilized the experience of rapid construction, concentrating superior forces to first focus on major projects. In the first half of this year, efforts were concentrated on building the ironmaking system, and after the completion of the No. 2 blast furnace, efforts were concentrated on building the open-hearth furnace, which greatly advanced the completion dates of these projects. The No. 2 blast furnace, completed in July, and the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, completed before National Day, were completed one year and ten months ahead of schedule, respectively. The No. 2 open-hearth furnace, No. 3 open-hearth furnace, No. 3 coke oven, and No. 4 coke oven, originally planned to be completed in 1960, were also completed successively in the second half of this year, with the No. 4 coke oven already producing coke on the 29th ahead of schedule. Now they are concentrating on building the primary rolling mill.

On the 27th, over ten thousand employees of the entire company held a gathering to celebrate the great victory of overfulfilling the basic construction and production plans for 1959. They resolved to work practically, industriously, and skillfully in the new year, and resolutely overfulfill the tasks assigned by the Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, December 30th: Baotou Iron and Steel Corporation has completed its basic construction and production plans for this year ahead of schedule. The annual production plans for pig iron and steel have been completed ahead of schedule, and the basic construction plan was completed as early as October 28th.

This year, the Baotou Iron and Steel builders, on a long construction line stretching from Baiyunebo in the Ulanqab grassland in the north to the banks of the Yellow River in the south, completed a production system centered on the No. 1 automated large blast furnace one year ahead of schedule, bringing Baotou Iron and Steel into a new stage of simultaneous construction and production.

In the Baiyunebo iron ore area, which is under construction, the raw material supply after the No. 1 blast furnace was put into production has been guaranteed. The No. 4 and No. 3 large coke ovens, which were put into production this year, produced coke that, in addition to meeting the needs of the enterprise, also supported 251 brother factories and mines. The first thermal power plant has two powerful generator sets in operation. A large-scale water supply system has been completed. The general machinery plant, among others, was also put into production this year.

Currently, the Baotou Iron and Steel builders are actively constructing the mine crushing system, the iron ore sintering plant, and the steelmaking system in accordance with the national plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 30th: After overfulfilling the annual total output value plan thirty-eight days ahead of schedule, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has also completed the annual output plan for various products ahead of schedule. Significant achievements have also been made in product quality and variety. The product variety completed 118% of the annual plan. The overall labor productivity completed 117.7% of the annual plan. The cost was reduced by 5% compared to the plan.

This year's production task of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company was completed by fully utilizing the potential of existing equipment. Since the beginning of spring, all employees have actively responded to the call of the company's Party committee, launched large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution, and carried out a socialist labor competition centered on high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, and high efficiency. After the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, the company launched a mechanization and semi-mechanization movement, which promoted the continuous improvement of production levels and achieved a full victory throughout the year.

　　坚决贯彻边建设边生产方针
    武钢包钢建设生产齐报捷
    太钢充分发挥潜力超额完成年计划
    据新华社武汉30日电　武汉钢铁公司提前完成了今年的基本建设计划和生产计划。
    这个钢铁联合企业今年共有八十项工程建成投入生产。全年基本建设投资计划已经提前四十一天超额11％完成，基本建设成本降低16.68％。各项主体工程都建设得又快又好。
    钢、铁、焦炭、矿石四大主要产品和十几种附属产品的生产计划都提前在12月22日全面超额完成。
    武钢今年在建设中，各级党委实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，充分调动职工的积极性和创造性，克服了各种困难。许多公司的党委书记、经理等领导干部都分别到平炉、轧钢、高炉、烧结等重点工程参加劳动；他们有事和职工商量，共同讨论计划，研究措施，大大鼓舞了职工的劳动热情。
    在施工中，武钢充分运用快速施工的经验，集中优势兵力首先突击主体工程。今年上半年，集中力量建设炼铁系统，二号高炉竣工后，又集中力量建设平炉，使这些工程的竣工期限大大提前。7月建成的二号高炉和国庆前夕建成的一号平炉，分别比计划提前了一年和十个月。原计划在1960年建成的二号平炉、三号平炉、三号焦炉、四号焦炉，也都在今年下半年先后建成，其中四号焦炉已经在29日提前出焦。现在他们又正在集中力量建设初轧厂。
    27日，全公司上万名职工举行集会，庆祝1959年基本建设和生产超额完成计划的伟大胜利，他们决心在新的一年内要实干，苦干，巧干，坚决超额完成党交给的任务。
    据新华社包头30日电　包头钢铁公司已经提前完成今年的基本建设和生产计划。全年生铁和钢的生产计划都已分别提前完成，基本建设计划早在10月28日就提前完成了。
    今年，包钢建设者在北起乌兰察布草原上的白云鄂博，南至黄河边的漫长施工线上，提前一年建成了以一号自动化大型高炉为中心的生产体系，使包钢进入了边建设边生产的新阶段。
    在建设中的白云鄂博铁矿区，已保证了一号高炉投入生产以后的原料供应。在今年投入生产的四号和三号两座大型焦炉，生产的焦炭除了满足企业内部的需要以外，还外调支援了二百五十一个兄弟厂矿。第一热电站已经有两个强大的发电机组投入生产。规模巨大的供水系统已经建成。今年投入生产的，还有机械总厂等。
    目前，包钢建设者正按照国家计划，积极建设矿山大破碎系统、铁矿烧结厂和炼钢系统。
