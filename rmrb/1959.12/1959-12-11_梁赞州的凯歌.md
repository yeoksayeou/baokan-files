The victory song of Ryazan Oblast's agricultural workers, who completed three years of meat production tasks in one year during the first year of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan filled with the triumph songs of communist construction, is particularly loud and clear. The entire Soviet people rejoiced in the achievements of Ryazan Oblast. Now, when Soviet collective farmers talk about Ryazan Oblast, they affectionately praise it as a "good example!"

People still remember that at the beginning of this year, when the bugle call for the full-scale development of communist construction was sounded across the Soviet land, the people of Ryazan Oblast were the first to respond to the Party's call to drastically increase meat production, determined to triple meat production compared to last year in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, and challenged the whole country with this. The pioneering spirit of Ryazan Oblast quickly received an enthusiastic response from all over the Soviet Union. Thus, a production competition centered on increasing meat production, as well as agricultural and livestock products, took shape, and the people of Ryazan Oblast have always been at the forefront of the competition.

Now, the people of Ryazan Oblast have fulfilled their promise: they have completed the three-year meat production task in less than a year.

	From Backward to Advanced
Not long ago, we came to Ryazan Oblast and met the ordinary yet extraordinary people who achieved this great achievement with their hard work. Although the snow was filling the fields in the severe winter, and although the temperature had dropped to minus twenty degrees Celsius, the land, reverberating with the passion of communist construction, was filled with the atmosphere of spring.

Ryazan Oblast is located south of Moscow, more than two hundred kilometers away from Moscow. The winding Oka River flows through it, and the terrain is flat. Judging from the soil and climate conditions, it is not very conducive to the growth of crops. For a long time, the grain yield in the entire state was very low, and animal husbandry had not been well developed. Before 1953, Ryazan Oblast was a backward state in terms of agricultural and livestock products. In 1953, the total meat delivered by the state was only 23,000 tons, which means that it was far from meeting the needs of the people's lives in the state. Old villagers recalled humorously: "We are still considered livestock product farms! We have to go to Moscow to buy meat." Poultry production was almost non-existent. Gerkova, a chicken-raising girl from the "Kirov" farm, told us: "Not to mention chicken, even eggs have become golden eggs. The cost of an egg is twelve rubles." The high-quality dairy cows bred locally also had very low milk production.

After the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee in 1953, the Soviet Communist Party took many measures to drastically increase agricultural and livestock production. During this period, the agricultural and livestock production in Ryazan Oblast underwent a fundamental change. In 1958, the number of large livestock per 100 hectares of agricultural land doubled compared to 1953, and the number of pigs per 100 hectares of cultivated land increased by two times.

When all parts of the Soviet Union were discussing the Seven-Year Plan, revising and raising production targets, and striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the Ryazan Oblast Party Committee was considering this question: could meat production be tripled by relying on self-breeding and self-raising, and more breeding and more raising? This bold idea was supported at the agricultural conference held by the Oblast Party Committee. After calculation, it was believed that as long as the Party's organizational work and political work were strengthened, the masses were fully mobilized, and the production potential was fully exploited, it would be possible to increase meat production by three times.

The people of Ryazan Oblast warmly supported this plan, and completed the three-year meat production task in less than a year. At the same time, they also completed the annual production plans for other agricultural and livestock products. Calculated on the basis of meat production per 100 hectares of agricultural land, it reached 52 quintals, while last year it was only 9.5 quintals; 150,000 tons of meat were sold to the state, while last year it was only more than 40,000 tons.

We learned in Ryazan Oblast that their basic methods for greatly increasing meat production this year are: not missing a single breeding opportunity, self-breeding and self-raising, more breeding and more raising, especially paying attention to pig breeding; ensuring the highest survival rate of small livestock; using various feeds and improving feeding methods to make each head of large livestock grow about half a kilogram per day. At the same time, we also learned that the main reason for this victory is the people's communist labor enthusiasm.

	Deep Roots and Flourishing Leaves
The achievements of Ryazan Oblast in meat production this year are not accidental. After talking with the party workers of the state and district, farm chairmen, and farmers, our impression in this regard became even deeper. It can be said that this great victory is the result of the Party's strengthening of organizational work and mass political and ideological work, as well as the improvement of the communist consciousness of the broad masses of the people.

When we came to the state center from Moscow to visit the State Party Committee, the comrades of the State Party Committee received us very warmly, but we couldn't find a responsible comrade to introduce the production situation to us, because the responsible comrades were all down in the districts and farms.

After the first day of farm visits, we discovered that going down to the farms, going down to the livestock sheds, and going down to places with difficult work - this has almost become the "working principle" of local party organizations and communists at all levels. Responsible comrades of the state and district party committees spent most of their working hours going deep into the fields, deep into the livestock sheds, specifically helping to organize production, and carrying out mass political and ideological work. Almost all districts and farms were stationed with experienced cadres from the state and district party committees to help strengthen the work of the basic-level party. Zirokov, First Secretary of the Sherov District Committee, said: "To win the battle, we must have organizational and ideological preparation. We carry out mass political education work, requiring that every 'soldier' understands the great significance of this meat production war, and that each of them chooses their own combat position and consciously completes the task."

At the beginning of the competition, party members in various farms stood on the front line of meat production. When the "Socialist Foundation" farm in Sherov District held a basic-level party member meeting, all 36 party members unanimously requested to "go to the meat production front." This initiative immediately received enthusiastic support from party members throughout the state. Before long, three thousand party members voluntarily came to the cowsheds and pigsties. Currently, more than 7,000 members of the Soviet Communist Party are participating in labor on the livestock production front throughout the state. They all set an example, closely contacted the masses, organized and promoted the mass competition for increased livestock production. We visited many cowsheds, pigsties, and chicken coops, where production competition supervision posts and advanced experience introduction meetings were organized with party members as the core, and red corners and wall newspapers were also set up to encourage morale, so that the farmers were always full of enthusiasm in their work.

At the same time, the Party entrusted the most important tasks to outstanding Communist Party members. Party members used exemplary actions to directly lead the masses to move forward together. When we visited the "October Incident" farm, we met Petokhova, a cowherd with nearly 20 years of Party membership. As soon as we entered their group's cowshed, we immediately felt a sense of cleanliness and tidiness. Even on the bedding under the cows, there was no manure. A performance sheet written in red ink was conspicuously hung on the wall near the entrance, which stated that Petokhova planned to make the cows she was raising gain 1.1 kilograms of meat per head per day, but in fact it reached 1.15 kilograms! Her team has raised a total of 400 cows this year, which is 230 more than last year. The cows raised by their team at the age of six months all weighed 200 to 300 kilograms. Because they improved the feeding method, there was not a single case of livestock sickness or death throughout the year, and each cow gained an average of one kilogram of meat per day. Petokhova not only often helps other comrades in the group, but also cares very much about the lives of the group members. The group is full of an atmosphere of unity and friendship. The farm chairman was also present during the visit. When he introduced Petokhova, he said: "Everyone sees her working as hard as the young people from morning till night, who would be embarrassed to slack off?" But Petokhova explained: "Everyone is the same, building communism, there is no distinction between each other!" When asked how she overcame difficulties and tripled production, she replied with a hearty laugh: "As the saying goes: if you don't throw a hook, the fish won't jump into your hands by themselves!"

In the "Russia" farm, there is a labor hero in pig raising, Communist Party member Sudavikh, whose pig raising team handed over 1,400 large meat pigs to the state this year, nearly 1,000 more than last year. This farm only produced 100 quintals of pork per 100 hectares of cultivated land this year, more than twice the amount produced in the United States! The pigs raised by Sudavikh gained 700 grams or one kilogram of meat per day. Whenever we mentioned the name of Sudavikh, we always heard praise.

The exemplary deeds of the Communist Party members in the livestock production in Ryazan Oblast are countless.

	Collective Wisdom and Efforts
In the districts and farms of Ryazan Oblast, we saw men and women, old and young, competing to contribute their strength to the task of increasing meat production. We heard in Moscow that there was an old farmer named Kavrova in the "Socialist Foundation" farm. She is a milkmaid, and in thirty years, she has milked 1.5 million tons of milk. Comrade Khrushchev once said very figuratively: if these milks are gathered together, ocean-going ships can be opened! Unfortunately, when we arrived at the "Socialist Foundation" farm, Kavrova was in Moscow attending the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet meeting. But whether it was the farmers of the "Socialist Foundation" farm or the "Kirov" farm, they all knew her and introduced her deeds to us. The entire Ryazan Oblast calls Kavrova the "Mother of Ryazan Milkmaids." She is 67 years old this year and was originally planning to retire, but when the Seven-Year Plan was announced, she wrote a letter to Comrade Khrushchev saying that in order to participate in communist construction, she decided not to retire and guaranteed that in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, the cows she managed would produce an average of 8,700 kilograms of milk per year. She also wrote a letter to women throughout the state, calling on them to carry out production competitions. Under her influence, women throughout the state actively participated in the competition. Kavrova was also elected as the chairman of the state's production competition inspection committee. In order to help farms in various places overcome difficulties and complete tasks, she often went to districts and farms to inspect and impart advanced experience. The people of Ryazan Oblast love her and take her as an example.

In the chicken coop of the "Kirov" farm, we met two sisters: 22-year-old Gerkova and 17-year-old Valia. Both sisters voluntarily requested to work in the farm's chicken coop after graduating from middle school. The two sisters raised more than 1,000 white chickens with snowy feathers and red crowns. They loved their work very much. They took time to read many scientific books on raising poultry, and soon created a complete set of chicken-raising methods. The chickens they raised not only grew fast, but also continued to increase egg production. More than 80% of the livestock production positions in Ryazan Oblast are women, and a large proportion of them are young women. When we visited several farm livestock farms, we saw that most of the cowsheds and pigsties were managed by youth work teams. According to statistics, there are more than 50,000 young men and women working in livestock farming throughout the state, of which more than 10,000 have a secondary education level, and the rest are graduates of primary schools. The Party entrusted this arduous task to young people because they have a certain level of cultural knowledge and can combine science with production more quickly to improve production. Women and young people in Ryazan Oblast played an outstanding role in this year's livestock production and have been praised by the CPSU Central Committee and Comrade Khrushchev more than once.

In the two meat production assault months of August and September, all the farms in the state were mobilized. After repeated research and experiments, many farmers made each sow produce an average of 30 piglets. Satsky District, which took the lead in the state, did a particularly good job in breeding. The "Stalin" farm in this district obtained 93 to 98 calves from an average of 100 dairy cows undergoing artificial insemination. Many farms organized shock teams for feed production.

Under the spirit of strengthening the connection between education and life, middle and primary school students throughout the state generally actively participated in chicken and rabbit raising. When we passed through Yushchi Rural Middle School during our visit, the young principal Dmitriev insisted that we visit the students' labor achievements. He excitedly told us that the middle school had raised more than 1,000 chickens and rabbits this year, and these chickens and rabbits had been handed over to the farm and then to the state.

Urban workers also contributed as much as possible to meat production. For example, the workers of the Shanichi Sugar Factory used the remaining raw materials from sugar making to feed 6,000 pigs, 1,500 large livestock, and 25,000 poultry. In order to facilitate feeders in various places, save them time to go to the city to purchase goods, and concentrate on production, the trade organs of Ryazan Oblast also mobilized, organized special sales vehicles to go to the countryside, and delivered various supplies to livestock farms and farmers' homes.

The agricultural workers of Ryazan Oblast have successfully completed this year's task of increasing livestock products. The people of the entire state are not complacent. Not long ago, the State Party Committee decided to declare war on sandy land, accumulate 7 million tons of fertilizer, and strive for a double harvest of grain and feed next year; at the same time, it is necessary to vigorously develop animal husbandry, mainly pig breeding, and require an increase of 700,000 piglets in the first half of 1960. The people of Ryazan Oblast are joining hands with the people of the entire Soviet Union to greet 1960 with confidence. (Attached image)

    梁赞州的凯歌
    本报记者　戴枫
    在充满着共产主义建设凯歌的苏联七年计划第一年里，梁赞州农业劳动者一年完成三年肉类生产任务的胜利歌声特别嘹亮。全苏人民都为梁赞州的成就欢欣鼓舞。现在，苏联集体农民一谈到梁赞州都会亲切地称赞一声：“好榜样！”
    人们都还记得，今年年初，当全面展开共产主义建设的号角在苏维埃大地上吹响起来的时候，梁赞州的劳动人民首先响应党的急剧提高肉类生产的号召，决心要在七年计划头一年里，把肉类生产比去年猛增三倍，并以此向全国挑战。梁赞州的首创精神，迅速得到全苏各地热烈的响应。于是，一个以增产肉类为中心的农畜产品增产竞赛形成了，而走在竞赛最前边的一直是梁赞州的劳动人民。
    现在，梁赞州人民实现了自己的诺言：不到一年就完成了三年的肉类生产任务。
        从落后到先进
    不久前，我们来到了梁赞州，会见了用辛勤的双手取得这个重大成就的普通而又不平凡的人们。尽管是严冬的雪花撒满了田野，尽管是气温已降至零下二十多度，但是在这共产主义建设激情回荡的大地上，到处洋溢着春天的气息。
    梁赞州位于莫斯科以南，同莫斯科相距二百多公里。蜿蜒曲折的奥卡河川流其间，地势平坦。从土壤和气候条件看来，并不十分有利于农作物的生长。长期以来，全州谷物产量很低，畜牧业没有得到很好的发展。1953年以前，梁赞州在农畜产品方面是落后的一个州。1953年，全州交售的肉类仅有二万三千吨，这就是说，连满足本州人民生活需要也差得很远。老庄员回忆起来诙谐地说：“我们还算是畜产品农庄呢！吃肉都要上莫斯科去买。”家禽生产几乎没有。“基洛夫”农庄养鸡姑娘格尔斯科娃对我们说：“别说鸡肉了，鸡蛋都成了金蛋。一个鸡蛋的成本要十二个卢布。”本地种的优质奶牛产奶量也很低。
    1953年苏共中央9月全会以后，苏联共产党采取了许多措施，急剧地提高农畜业生产。这期间，梁赞州的农畜业生产面貌获得根本的改变。1958年一百公顷农业用地上大家畜头数比1953年增加了一倍，一百公顷耕地上猪的头数增加二倍。
    当全苏各地讨论七年计划，纷纷修订提高生产指标，力争提前完成七年计划的时候，梁赞州的党委就考虑着这样一个问题：能不能依靠自繁自养、多繁多养等方法，使肉类增产三倍呢？这个大胆的想法，在州党委召开的农业会议上得到了拥护。经过计算，认为只要加强党的组织工作和政治工作，全面动员群众，充分发掘生产潜力，那末使肉类生产提高三倍是可能的。
    梁赞州劳动人民热烈拥护这个计划，并且在不到一年的时间内就完成了三年肉类增产任务，同时，也完成了其他农畜产品的年度生产计划。按一百公顷农业用地上产肉量计算，达到了五十二公担，而去年只有九点五公担；交售给国家十五万吨肉类，而去年只有四万多吨。
    我们在梁赞州了解到，他们今年肉类大增产的基本方法是：不放过一个配种机会，自繁自养，多繁多养，尤其是注意了猪的繁殖；保证小家畜最高成活率；利用各种饲料，改善喂养方法，使每头大牲畜每昼夜增长半公斤左右。同时，我们也了解到，取得这个胜利的主要原因，还是在于人们的共产主义劳动热忱。
          根深叶茂
    梁赞州今年肉类生产的成就得来并不是偶然的。我们在和州、区党的工作者、农庄主席、庄员们谈话后，这方面的印象更加深了。可以这样说，这个巨大胜利是党加强组织工作和群众政治思想工作，以及广大劳动人民共产主义觉悟提高的结果。
    我们从莫斯科来到了州中心访问州党委时，州党委同志很热情的招待我们，可是就是找不到负责同志给我们介绍生产情况，因为负责同志都下区、下农庄了。
    经过第一天的农庄访问后，我们就发觉：下农庄、下畜舍、下到工作困难的地方去——这几乎已成为当地各级党组织和共产党员们的“工作原则”了。州、区党委负责同志把大部分的工作时间用在深入田间，深入畜舍，具体帮助组织生产，进行群众政治思想工作上面去了。各区农庄差不多都驻有州、区党委的有经验的干部，帮助加强基层党的工作。雪洛夫区委第一书记齐洛科夫对我们说：“要打胜仗，必须要有组织和思想准备。我们进行群众政治教育工作，要求达到使每个‘战士’懂得这场肉类增产战的巨大意义，并使他们每个人选择好自己的战斗岗位，自觉地完成任务。”
    还在竞赛开始时，各地农庄党员就纷纷站到肉类增产第一线上。雪洛夫区“社会主义基础”农庄开基层党员大会时，全体三十六名党员一致要求“到肉类生产战线上去”。这个倡议立刻得到全州党员的热烈拥护。不多久，三千名党员自动地来到牛棚、猪圈。目前有七千多名苏共党员在全州的畜产品生产战线上参加劳动。他们都以身作则，紧密联系群众，组织并推动了全州畜产品增产大竞赛。我们参观了许多牛棚、猪圈、鸡舍，那里都以党员为核心组织了生产竞赛监督岗、先进经验介绍会，并且办了红角和墙报等来鼓舞斗志，使庄员们在劳动中时时情绪饱满。
    同时，党还把最重要的任务委托给优秀共产党员们。党员们用示范行动直接地带动群众一起前进。我们在“十月事件”农庄访问时，遇到了有将近二十年党龄的养牛员彼多霍娃。一走进她们小组的牛棚，顿时就有一种清洁整齐的感觉，即使是牛身下的垫草上也看不到粪尿。靠门口墙上醒目地挂着一张红墨水写的成绩表，上面写着彼多霍娃计划让她喂养的牛每头每昼夜增长一点一公斤肉，而事实上却达到了一点一五公斤！她领导的小组一共四个人，今年共喂大了四百头牛，即比去年多喂了二百三十头。她们小组喂的满六个月的牛，都长到二、三百公斤。由于她们改进了喂养方法，全年没有发生过一次牲畜生病或死亡的事情，每天每条牛平均长一公斤肉。彼多霍娃不但时常帮助组内其他同志，并且非常关心组员们的生活，小组里充满团结友爱的气氛。参观时，农庄主席也在场。他介绍彼多霍娃时说：“大家见她跟青年人一样起早摸黑的干，谁还好意思偷闲呢？”彼多霍娃却解释说：“大家都一样啊，建设共产主义，那还分彼此！”当问到她如何克服困难，增产三倍时，她笑声朗朗地回答说：“俗语说得好：不下钩，鱼是不会自己跳到你手心里来的啊！”
    在“俄罗斯”农庄有一名养猪劳动英雄、共产党员苏达维赫，她领导的养猪组今年交给了国家一千四百头大肉猪，比去年多了将近一千头。这个农庄今年一百公顷耕地仅产猪肉就达一百公担，超过了美国一倍多！苏达维赫喂养的猪一昼夜有的长了七百克或一公斤肉。我们每到一处只要一提起苏达维赫的名字，总是有口皆碑。
    梁赞州畜产品生产中共产党员的忘我劳动的模范事例是不胜枚举的。
          群策群力
    我们在梁赞州各区农庄，到处都见到男男女女，老老少少，争先恐后地为肉类增产任务贡献自己的力量。在莫斯科就听说，“社会主义基础”农庄有个老庄员卡甫洛娃，她是挤奶员，三十年来，她挤的牛奶有一百五十万吨。赫鲁晓夫同志曾经非常形象地说：如果把这些牛奶汇集起来，可以开海船了！这次非常不巧，我们到“社会主义基础”农庄时，卡甫洛娃正上莫斯科出席俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃会议去了。但不管是“社会主义基础”农庄还是“基洛夫”农庄的庄员们全都知道她，并向我们介绍了她的事迹。全梁赞州都把卡甫洛娃称为“梁赞挤奶员的母亲”。她今年六十七岁了，本来准备退休了，但当七年计划公布后，她就写信给赫鲁晓夫同志说，为了参加共产主义建设，她决定不退休了，并且保证在七年计划第一年里，使自己管理的奶牛每条平均年产八千七百公斤奶。她还写信给全州妇女，号召开展生产竞赛。在她的影响下，全州妇女积极投入了竞赛。卡甫洛娃还被推选为州的生产竞赛检查委员会主席。为了帮助各地农庄克服困难，完成任务，她经常到各区农庄巡视和传授先进经验。梁赞州的人都热爱她，并以她为榜样。
    在“基洛夫”农庄的鸡舍里，我们遇见了两姐妹：二十二岁的格尔斯科娃和十七岁的瓦丽娅。她俩都是中学毕业后自动要求来到农庄鸡舍来工作的。姐妹俩喂养一千多只雪毛红冠的白种鸡。她们非常热爱自己的工作，平时抽空读了许多喂养家禽的科学书籍，不久就创造了一套完整的喂鸡方法。她们喂的鸡不仅长得快，而且产蛋量不断提高。在梁赞州畜牧业生产岗位上80％以上是妇女，而且其中女青年占很大比例。我们在几个农庄畜牧场参观时看到，绝大多数牛棚、猪圈都是青年工作班管理。据统计，全州在畜牧业方面工作的有五万多名青年男女，其中一万多名具有中等教育水平，其余都是初级学校毕业的。党把这一繁重的任务交给了青年人，因为他们具有一定的文化知识水平，能更快地使科学结合生产，提高生产。梁赞州妇女和青年在今年的畜产品生产中起了卓越的作用，受到了苏共中央和赫鲁晓夫同志的不止一次的赞扬。
    在8、9两个肉类生产突击月中，全州农庄总动员。许多农庄庄员经过反复研究试验，使每头母猪平均产猪仔三十头。全州一马当先的萨茨基区繁殖配种作得特别好。这个区的“斯大林”农庄平均一百条奶牛进行人工配种，得到了九十三至九十八条小牛。许多农庄组织了饲料生产突击生产队。
    全州农村中、小学校学生在加强教育同生活的联系的精神下，普遍积极参加了养鸡、养兔的工作。我们访问中途经尤斯契农村中学时，年轻的校长季米特里夫一定要我们参观学生们的劳动成绩。他兴奋地告诉我们，这个中学今年喂大了一千多只鸡和兔子，这些鸡兔已交给农庄转交给国家了。
    城市的职工们也尽可能为肉类生产出一把力。例如沙尼齐制糖厂职工们，利用制糖剩余原料喂养了六千头猪、一千五百头大家畜、二万五千头家禽。为了便利各地饲养员，节省他们上城里办货时间，专心生产，梁赞州的贸易机关也动员起来，组织了下乡售货专车，把各种用品送到养畜场、庄员家门口。
    梁赞州的农业劳动者出色地完成了今年畜产品增产任务。全州人民毫不骄傲自满。不久前，州党委会又决定，向砂子地宣战，积肥七百万吨，争取明年谷物、饲料双丰收；同时还要大力发展畜牧业，主要是养猪业，要求在1960年上半年增加七十万头猪仔。梁赞州的劳动人民正和全苏联人民一道，满怀信心地迎接1960年。（附图片）
