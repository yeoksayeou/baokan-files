Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Tokyo: Kenzo Matsumura, advisor to the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, who returned from a visit to China, published an article in the "Tokyo Shimbun" today, pointing out that the Japanese government should correctly understand the current situation in China to determine its policies.

Matsumura said that the Chinese people are using their own hands to promote construction in various aspects such as industry, railways, water conservancy, and people's communes at an astonishing speed, which is beyond expectations. We should frankly admit this fact.

He pointed out that this has been achieved because the Chinese people have raised their national consciousness and launched nationwide movements.

Matsumura said that if anyone thinks that the Chinese government will be overthrown one day, that is a big mistake.

Matsumura pointed out that the Chinese people have no hostility towards the Japanese people, but they harbor strong anger towards the policies of the Nobusuke Kishi government, especially towards the revision of the "Security Treaty." He said that Japan cannot ignore the emergence of a nation with national consciousness and modern industry near Japan.

Matsumura emphasized that it is not good to allow the relationship between Japan and China to remain in a state of severance. We should face and recognize the facts, and seriously consider what kind of policy should be established.

    松村在“东京新闻”著文指出
    日本应正确认识中国现状
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：从中国访问归来的日本自由民主党顾问松村谦三今天在“东京新闻”上发表文章指出，日本政府应该正确认识中国的现状来确定政策。
    松村说，中国人民用自己的手以惊人的速度推进工业、铁路、水利和人民公社等各方面的建设，它的速度出乎预料之外。我们应该坦率地承认这个事实。
    他指出，这是由于中国人民提高了民族觉悟，展开全民性运动才能够实现的。
    松村说，倘若有人想，中国政府将有一天会被颠覆的话，那是大错特错的。
    松村指出，中国人民对日本人民并没有敌意，但是对岸信介政府的政策，尤其是对修改“安全条约”怀着强烈的愤怒。他说，日本不能忽视在靠近日本的地方出现一个有国民觉悟和拥有近代产业的国家。
    松村强调指出，听任日中两国关系停留在断绝状态，这是不好的。应该正视和认识事实，认真考虑应该树立何种政策。
