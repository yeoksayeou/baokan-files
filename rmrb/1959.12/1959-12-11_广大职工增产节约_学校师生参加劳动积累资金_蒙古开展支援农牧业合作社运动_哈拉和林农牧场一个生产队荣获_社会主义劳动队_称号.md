Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 10th. Mongolian factory and enterprise workers and school teachers and students are carrying out a movement to increase production and practice economy, and accumulate funds to support agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives.

　　In late November, the employees of the Ulaanbaatar Railway Bureau initiated a proposal to guarantee overfulfilling the income plan and accumulate 8 million Tugriks (Mongolian currency) to support the agricultural and pastoral cooperatives that have flourished this year. This proposal was supported by the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which believed that it was practical support from the working class to the agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, and it was of great significance for consolidating the alliance between workers and herdsmen. Subsequently, all teachers and students of the Ulaanbaatar Normal School also made a proposal to various higher specialized schools, calling for participation in one month of labor during the summer vacation next year to accumulate 200,000 Tugriks to support the cooperatives as funds to consolidate the cooperatives.

　　These two initiatives received a wide response immediately after they were issued. Employees of the Mongolian Industrial United Factory decided to accumulate 300,000 Tugriks in the last month of this year. The Dongbaiyin Oil Factory decided to over fulfill the income plan to support the cooperative with one million Tugriks. The Ulaanbaatar Furniture Factory, Sewing Cooperative, Bus Station and other units have also developed plans to increase production, practice economy, and support the cooperatives. Teachers and students from Choibalsan University and specialized schools of finance and law also held meetings one after another, expressing their support for the two initiatives.

　　The support of factory workers and school teachers and students inspired the production enthusiasm of members of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. Ten agricultural and pastoral cooperatives in ten provinces including Choibalsan and Central Province jointly published an article in the newspaper on the 2nd, expressing their gratitude and determination to actively increase production and accelerate the socialist construction of agriculture and animal husbandry.

　　This newspaper, Ulaanbaatar, 10th dispatch: A production team of the Mongolian Khara Khorin Agricultural and Pastoral Farm, after fulfilling the conditions of various guarantees, has recently been officially awarded the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team" by the Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Youth League, becoming an advanced example on the Mongolian agricultural and pastoral production front.

　　The sixteen young workers, headed by tractor driver Dalza, formed a production team in March this year and put forward various requirements to meet the standards of the "Socialist Labor Team."

　　In the past eight months, this production team has over fulfilled its plans in spring ploughing, summer deep plowing, autumn ploughing, and autumn harvesting. Due to the good plowing work, the grain yield per hectare reached 13.2 quintals during the autumn harvest, an increase of 5.2 quintals compared to the original plan. The production team carefully saved fuel, saving the country more than 30,000 Tugriks (Mongolian currency).

　　This production team also organized study groups to learn agricultural and pastoral technology and agricultural knowledge, helping each other in learning and life, setting a good example.

　　The Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Youth League called on trade union members, members of the Communist Youth League, and all employees to learn from the advanced experience of the "Socialist Labor Team" and further carry out the movement to strive for this glorious title.

    新华社乌兰巴托10日电　蒙古各工厂企业职工和学校师生们正在开展一个增产节约、积累资金支援农牧业生产合作社的运动。
    11月下旬，乌兰巴托市铁路局职工提出了倡议，保证要超额完成收入计划，积累八百万图格里克（蒙币名）资金，以支援今年蓬勃发展起来的农牧业合作社。这个倡议得到了蒙古人民革命党中央委员会的支持，党中央认为，这是工人阶级对农牧业合作社的实际支援，对巩固工人和牧民的联盟有重要意义。随后，乌兰巴托市师范学校全体师生也向各高等专科学校提出倡议，号召在明年利用暑假参加一个月的劳动，积累二十万图格里克来支援合作社，作为巩固合作社的资金。
    这两项倡议发出后，立即得到广泛的响应。蒙古工业联合工厂职工决定，在今年最后1月积累三十万图格里克。东白音石油厂决定超额完成收入计划，以一百万图格里克支援合作社。乌兰巴托木器工厂、缝纫合作社、汽车站等单位也订出了增产节约、支援合作社的计划。乔巴山大学，财经、法律等专科学校的师生们也相继集会，表示支持这两个倡议。
    工厂职工和学校师生们的支援鼓舞了农牧业合作社的社员们的生产积极性。乔巴山、中央等十个省的十个农牧业合作社在2日联名在报上发表文章，表示感谢，并且决心积极增加生产，努力加快农牧业的社会主义建设。
    本报乌兰巴托10日电：蒙古哈拉和林农牧场的一个生产队，在实现了各项保证的条件后，最近正式获得蒙古工会中央理事会和革命青年团中央委员会授予“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号，成为蒙古农牧业生产战线上的先进榜样。
    以拖拉机手达尔扎为首的十六名青年工人，今年3月间组成了一支生产队，并提出了达到“社会主义劳动队”标准的各项要求。
    这个生产队在过去的八个月中，在春耕生产、夏季深翻、秋耕地以及秋收工作中，都超额完成了计划。由于翻地工作做得好，秋收时每公顷谷物产量达到十三点二公担，比原订计划增多了五点二公担。生产队认真节约燃料，替国家节约了三万多图格里克（蒙币）的资金。
    这个生产队还组织了学习农牧业技术和农业知识的学习小组，在学习和生活中互相帮助，作出了良好的范例。
    蒙古工会中央理事会和革命青年团中央委员会号召工会会员、青年团员以及全体职工们学习“社会主义劳动队”的先进经验，进一步开展争取获得这一光荣称号的运动。
