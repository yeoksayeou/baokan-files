Technical Revolution is the Demand of the Masses
——The Experience of Technical Transformation of Small Coal Pits in Qiyang Coal Mine, Hunan
Xiang Wen

    The small coal pits of Qiyang Coal Mine in Hunan Province have achieved remarkable results in technical transformation. Their basic experience is:

    To have a technical revolution, first there must be an ideological revolution

    The process of technical innovation and technical revolution in Qiyang Coal Mine is first and foremost a process of ideological revolution. At the beginning of the movement, the vast majority of workers warmly welcomed technical innovation and technical revolution, but a small number of people lacked confidence in technical innovation and technical revolution. Through airing of views and accounting, everyone saw the potential for production and realized that technical innovation and technical revolution were not only a need for production but also a demand of the masses. Thus, they unified their thinking and strengthened their determination and confidence in technical innovation and technical revolution.

    In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over technical innovation and technical revolution, the Party General Branch, on the basis of ideological mobilization, made a comprehensive plan from top to bottom and put forward specific tasks in stages; at the same time, it established a Technical Innovation Committee, with the secretary taking the lead personally, appointing a deputy mine director to take charge specifically, and other members contracting projects by division, forming special groups, and adopting the method of carrying a task through to the end. During the movement, the Party organization always stood at the forefront of the masses, supporting the advanced. As a result, all the mine's employees actively mobilized and formed a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution in which "everyone contributes ideas for creation, and everyone takes action to innovate."

    Self-Reliance, Indigenous Methods First, Foreign Methods for Transformation

    The rapid development and remarkable results of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Qiyang Coal Mine are particularly attributable to adhering to the principle of "from indigenous to foreign, combining indigenous and foreign methods." In the process of implementing this principle, there were two different attitudes: one was to value foreign methods over indigenous ones, saying, "To transform Qiyang Coal Mine, we must have foreign machines and foreign equipment," and passively waiting for the higher authorities to solve the problems; the other was to proceed from reality, implement the principle of "walking on two legs," and adopt the method of self-reliance, starting with indigenous methods first, followed by foreign methods for transformation. The Party General Branch and the majority of employees adhered to the latter attitude and, in a short period of seven months, carried out a series of technical transformations on all production links such as coal mining, ventilation, drainage, hoisting, transportation, sorting, crushing, washing, and refining, realizing the mechanization of the entire production process by combining indigenous and foreign methods. They were not satisfied with the status quo but innovated, summarized, and improved simultaneously. Initially, they felt that hauling coal manually was too clumsy and tiring, and the output was too low, so they changed to using indigenous winches; later, the workers were not satisfied with the status quo, continuously contributing ideas, installing ball bearings, and transforming them into winches that combined indigenous and foreign methods, increasing work efficiency fourfold compared to indigenous winches; recently, they converted the winches that combined indigenous and foreign methods to use automobile engines as power, and work efficiency was further increased by one and a half times. Another example is coal washing, which initially involved using yellow buckets and scoops to wash with both hands. The first step was to change to automatic flowing water coal washing troughs, increasing work efficiency twofold and saving more than 60 laborers; later, they developed from indigenous coal washing troughs to simple coal washing troughs, and then to double-layer coal washing troughs, increasing work efficiency by 4.5 times.

    Mass Movement is the Soul of Technological Innovation

    The experience of Qiyang Coal Mine proves that technical innovation and technical revolution are the urgent demands of the broad masses of employees. In the beginning, the workers reflected: "Dragging coal bruises the shoulders, digging coal hardens the hands, draining water hurts the buttocks, scooping coal strains the back, labor efficiency is low, tasks cannot be completed, it's hard work for little gain, we must find a trick." Under these circumstances, they consciously demanded to innovate technology, improve working conditions, and reduce labor intensity. For example, the old worker Liu Jishou saw that hauling coal manually was very strenuous and thought about it day and night, determined to improve it, and proposed to the leadership the suggestion of building an indigenous winch. The leadership adopted his suggestion and made eight indigenous winches, and since then, they no longer had to carry coal on their shoulders, and work efficiency was also doubled. The Party General Branch seized this urgent demand of the masses, guided the situation accordingly, launched a vigorous mass movement, and put forward the resounding slogan of "everyone uses their brains and everyone innovates," to which the employees responded enthusiastically and set off a "ten thousand suggestions competition" upsurge. As the technical innovation and technical revolution movement burned like wildfire in Qiyang Coal Mine, in less than half a month, a total of more than 11,000 rationalization proposals were put forward, an average of thirteen per person, and 380 innovation activists emerged, accounting for 47% of the total number of employees, including 115 pacesetters. In order to keep the mass movement rolling forward wave after wave, the entire mine timely launched competitive activities such as paired competitions between workshops, between groups, one-dragon competitions between work procedures, and personal opponent competitions and pacesetter competitions.

    Focus on Weak Links and Vigorously Attack Key Production Points

    Focus on the key points of production in each different period, concentrate forces to tackle weak links, and promote one weak link by breaking through another. First, they grasped the central link of transforming small tunnels, concentrating the main force to implement "four transformations" (small lanes changed to large lanes, curved lanes changed to straight lanes, steep slopes changed to inclined slopes, and artificial ventilation changed to natural ventilation). After the "four transformations" were realized, the faces increased from eight to twenty, the working face widened from the original 0.6 meters to more than one meter, and the output increased by more than 3.4 times. However, at this time, hoisting was still done with baskets, with a maximum of only 80 tons being hauled per day, so hoisting became a prominent weak link again. Therefore, the focus was on hoisting as the central task, and a vigorous indigenous winch movement was launched. After the weak links in the underground were eliminated, the central task was transferred to a series of processes on the ground such as crushing, sorting, and washing. At present, the various weak links in ground production and transportation have been basically resolved, so the mine Party General Branch has timely put forward the task of "consolidating, improving, and advancing again." Now, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of this coal mine has entered the fourth stage, which is centered on refining coke to remove sulfur and improve quality.

　　技术革命是群众的要求
　　——湖南祁阳煤矿小煤窑技术改造的经验
　　湘文
    湖南省祁阳煤矿的小煤窑在技术改造方面已经取得显著成绩。他们的基本经验是：
    要技术革命首先要思想革命
    祁阳煤矿技术革新和技术革命的过程首先是思想革命的过程。运动开始，绝大部分工人对技术革新和技术革命热情欢迎，但有少部分人对技术革新和技术革命缺乏信心。通过鸣放算账，大家看到了生产的潜力，看到了技术革新和技术革命不但是生产的需要，而且是群众的要求。从而统一了思想，坚定了对技术革新和技术革命的决心和信心。
    为了加强党对技术革新和技术革命的领导，党总支在思想发动的基础上，从上到下进行了全面规划，提出了分期分段的具体任务；同时，成立了技术革新委员会，书记亲自挂帅，确定一个副矿长专门抓，其他委员分项目包干，成立专题小组，采取一竿子插到底的办法。运动中，党组织自始至终站在群众的前头，支持先进。从而使全矿职工都积极行动起来，形成了一个“人人献计搞创造，个个动手搞革新”的技术革新和技术革命高潮。
    自力更生土法上马洋法改造
    祁阳煤矿技术革新和技术革命运动所以发展迅速，效果显著，特别重要的一条是坚持了“由土到洋、土洋结合”的方针。在贯彻这个方针的过程中，有两种不同的态度：一种是重洋轻土，说“要改造祁阳煤矿，就得有洋机器、洋设备”，消极地等待上面解决问题；另一种是从实际出发，贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，采取自力更生、先土法上马、后洋法改造的办法。党总支和多数职工坚持了后一种态度，在短短七个月的时间内，对采煤、通风、排水、提升、运输、选、碎、洗、炼等各个生产环节，进行了一系列的技术改造，实现了全部生产过程的土洋结合的机械化。他们并不满足现状，而是一边革新、一边总结、一边提高。开始用人工拖煤感到太笨太累，产量太低，便改用土绞车；后来工人不满足现状，连续献计，安上滚珠轴承，改成土洋结合的绞车，比土绞车提高工效四倍；最近把土洋结合的绞车，改用汽车引擎作动力，工效又提高了一倍半。又如洗煤，开始用黄桶捞箕两手掏洗，第一步改为自动流水洗煤槽，提高工效二倍，节约劳力六十余人；后来又由土洗煤槽发展为简易洗煤槽，再到双层洗煤槽，工效提高四点五倍。
    群众运动是革新技术的灵魂
    祁阳煤矿的经验证明：技术革新和技术革命，是广大职工群众的迫切要求。当初工人们反映：“拖煤肩压肿，挖煤手成钉，排水屁股痛，掏煤腰又酸，劳动工效低，任务完不成，费力不讨好，必须找窍门。”在这种情况下，他们自觉地要求革新技术，改善劳动条件，减轻劳动强度。如老工人刘继寿看到用人工拖煤很吃力，朝思暮想，决心要改进，并向领导提出了造土绞车的建议，领导采纳他的意见，做了八部土绞车，从此不再用肩挑了，工效还提高了一倍。党总支抓住群众这个迫切要求，因势利导，大搞群众运动，提出了“人人动脑筋，个个搞革新”的响亮口号，职工群众热烈响应党总支的号召，掀起了一个“万计竞赛”高潮。由于技术革新和技术革命运动像烈火一样在祁阳煤矿燃烧起来，不到半个月的时间，共提出合理化建议一万一千多条，平均每人十三条，涌现出革新积极分子三百八十人，占职工总人数的47％，其中标兵一百一十五人，为了使群众运动一浪盖一浪地滚滚向前，全矿适时地开展了车间与车间、小组与小组之间的对口赛，工序之间的一条龙赛，个人之间的对手赛、标兵赛等竞赛活动。
　　针对薄弱环节猛攻生产关键
    针对各个不同时期的生产关键，集中力量突击薄弱环节，通过突破一个薄弱环节去带动另一个薄弱环节。首先，他们抓住了改造小窿道这个中心环节，集中主力实行“四改”（小巷改大巷、弯巷改直巷、陡坡改斜坡、改人工通风为自然通风）。“四改”实现后，壋头由八个增加到二十个，工作面由原来的零点六米加宽到一米以上，产量提高了三点四倍以上。但这时提升仍用拖箕，一天最多拖八十多吨，于是提升又成了一个突出的薄弱环节，因此便以提升为中心课题，大搞土绞车化运动。井下薄弱环节消除以后，中心课题又转到地面的碎、选、洗等一连串的工序上来。目前，地面生产、运输的各个薄弱环节已经基本解决，因此矿党总支又及时提出了“巩固、提高、再前进”的任务。现在，这个煤矿的技术革新和技术革命运动已进入以炼焦去硫提高质量为中心的第四阶段。
