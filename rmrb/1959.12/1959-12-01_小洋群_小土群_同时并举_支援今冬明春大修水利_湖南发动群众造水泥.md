Simultaneously Promoting "Small Modern Groups" and "Small Indigenous Groups" to Support Large-Scale Water Conservancy Construction This Winter and Next Spring:
    Hunan Mobilizes the Masses to Produce Cement

(Our newspaper, Changsha, 30th dispatch) In order to support rural water conservancy construction and industrial capital construction, Hunan Province is launching a magnificent mass movement to produce cement. At present, preliminary results have been achieved. In the first twenty days of November, more than 7,600 tons of cement above grade 300 have been produced.

This year, the scale of capital construction in Hunan Province's industry and agriculture is grand, especially the large-scale water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, which requires a large amount of high-quality cement. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that increasing cement production is a major key to current capital construction. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee requested that Party committee secretaries at all levels personally take command, take emergency measures, and establish special leading bodies. On the basis of the existing "small modern groups" cement production, according to the principle of "walking on two legs," and using a combination of indigenous and modern methods, and a combination of large and small enterprises, a mass movement to produce cement is being launched. The "small indigenous groups" cement plants that were established last year should be restored as much as possible to produce more cement.

In the past, Hunan Province could not produce cement. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the guidance of the policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward, the province launched a mass movement to produce cement. In just a few months, more than 10,000 small vertical kilns were built, producing more than 100,000 tons of high and low grade cement, and more than 10,000 technicians and technical cadres were trained. At the beginning of this year, after rectification, consolidation and improvement, these small vertical kilns have gradually transitioned from "small indigenous groups" to "small modern groups". The number of "small modern groups" cement plants has increased to fifty-nine, and there are fifteen "small indigenous groups" cement plants, with a daily cement output of more than 600 tons; the cement grade has reached above grade 300, the production cost has been reduced to 50 yuan per ton, and the qualification rate has reached more than 95%. At the beginning of this mass movement to produce cement, on the one hand, dozens of "small modern groups" cement bases vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, tapped production potential, and achieved high output with fewer people, increasing the production of more high-quality cement. At the same time, all places in the province with cement kilns and cement production equipment have been put into production. People's communes, factories and mining enterprises in various places have also quickly restored the base points for large-scale cement production last year, and continued to carry out production by indigenous methods. The Gaosha Cement Plant in Dongkou County produced grade 500 cement entirely by indigenous methods. Some iron factories also organized forces to use slag to manufacture cement. The machinery and transportation departments also tried everything possible to support cement production according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee.

    “小洋群”“小土群”同时并举　支援今冬明春大修水利
    湖南发动群众造水泥
    本报长沙30日电　为了支援农村水利建设和工业基本建设，湖南省正在开展一个波澜壮阔的大造水泥的群众运动。目前，已经收到了初步效果，11月的前二十天就已生产出三百号以上的水泥七千六百多吨。
    今年，湖南省工农业基本建设规模宏大，特别是今冬明春的大修水利，需要大量优质水泥。中共湖南省委认为增加水泥生产是当前基本建设的一大关键。为此，省委要求各级党委书记亲自挂帅，采取紧急措施，成立专门的领导机构，在现有“小洋群”水泥生产的基础上，根据“两条腿走路”的方针，以土洋结合、大小结合的办法，开展一个大造水泥的群众运动。把去年办的“小土群”的水泥厂，尽量恢复起来，增产更多的水泥。
    过去湖南省不能生产水泥，大跃进以来，在以钢为纲全面跃进的方针指导下，全省曾掀起了大造水泥的群众运动，只几个月，就建立了小立窑一万多座，生产了高、低标号水泥十万多吨，还培养了技术工人和技术干部一万多名。今年年初，这些小立窑经过整顿、巩固提高后，已逐步由“小土群”过渡到
  “小洋群”。“小洋群”水泥厂增加到五十九个，“小土群”水泥厂十五个，日产水泥达六百多吨；水泥标号达到了三百号以上，生产成本降低到每吨五十元，合格率达到95％以上。这次大造水泥的群众运动一开始，一方面几十个“小洋群”水泥基地大搞技术革新和技术革命，大挖生产潜力，做到人少产量高，增产了更多的优质水泥。同时，全省凡是有水泥窑和有生产水泥设备的地方，都投入了生产。各地人民公社、厂矿企业也都迅速地把去年大搞水泥的基点恢复起来，继续用土法进行生产。洞口县高沙水泥厂全部用土法生产出五百标号的水泥。一些铁厂还组织力量利用炉渣制造水泥。各机械、交通运输部门也都根据省委的指示，想尽一切办法支援水泥生产。
