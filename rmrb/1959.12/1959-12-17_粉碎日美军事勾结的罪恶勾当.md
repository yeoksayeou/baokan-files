    The Japan-China Friendship Association Issues a Statement
    Resolutely Oppose the Revision of the "Security Treaty" and Defeat the Kishida Government's Anti-China Policy
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 16th: The Japan-China Friendship Association passed a statement at the National Board of Directors meeting held on the 15th, stating that it will resolutely fight against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and strive for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.
    The statement said that the Japan-China Friendship Association will launch a campaign to crush anti-China propaganda and defeat the anti-China policy of the Nobusuke Kishi government.
    The statement warned that if the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" succeeds, Japan-China relations will further deteriorate, and Japan's peace and independence will be ruined by militarists.
    The statement emphasized that the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" runs counter to the general international trend because its purpose is to attack China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries.
    The National Board of Directors meeting unanimously agreed that compared with the same movement carried out in the past ten years, the movement to strive for the normalization of Japan-China relations carried out in October and November this year was the most fruitful. The meeting emphasized that closely combining the struggle to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China with the movement to stop the Nobusuke Kishi government from revising the "Security Treaty" is an important aspect of this year's movement.

      Japanese Communist Party Senator Goro Suto Exposes
    The Kishi Government Assists the U.S. Military in Investigations in South Vietnam
    Accomplice in the U.S. Military's Aggression in the Far East
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 16th: According to today's "Akahata" report, Goro Suto, a member of the Japanese Communist Party in the House of Councillors, revealed at a meeting of the Communications Committee of the House of Councillors on the 10th that the Japanese government was helping the U.S. military investigate the construction of communication facilities in South Vietnam, assisting the U.S. military in carrying out military operations in the Far East.
    Suto said that the Japanese official Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation had sent an investigation team to South Vietnam to investigate the construction of VHF communication facilities for the U.S. military. The U.S. Far East Command, the U.S. military advisory group stationed in Japan, and South Vietnamese army personnel also participated in this investigation team.
    Suto pointed out that the investigation team also assisted the U.S. military in investigating the power, military communications, and the state of transportation agencies in South Vietnam. Suto pointed out that the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation also undertook similar work for the U.S. military stationed in Japan in the Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea, and Thailand.

          U.S. "New York Post" Admits
      The New U.S.-Japan Military Treaty is Hostile to China and the Soviet Union
        And Points the Spearhead of Aggression at Far Eastern Countries
    This newspaper reports that recent U.S. and Japanese newspapers, in reporting on the signing of the new "Security Treaty" between the U.S. and Japan, revealed that the new U.S.-Japan treaty is a military aggression alliance treaty that is unequivocally hostile to China, the Soviet Union, and the Asian people.
    On December 11, the U.S. "New York Post" reported in its "Washington News" column that the U.S. will use the new "Security Treaty" to further revive Japanese militarism and be hostile to China and the Soviet Union. The newspaper said that as a result of the signing of this treaty, Japan may obtain economic and technical assistance from the United States "to build a strong army, navy and air force, including many aircraft carriers and at least one nuclear submarine." It also said that Japan's possession of "this enhanced military power" is for the purpose of "countering" China and the Soviet Union.
    The "New York Post" also confirmed that the United States, through the revised U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," has actually formed a Northeast Asian military alliance and linked it to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, making Japan act as the Asian gendarme of the United States. According to the newspaper, the scope of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" includes Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, and the member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    粉碎日美军事勾结的罪恶勾当
    日中友好协会发表声明
    坚决反对修改“安全条约”击败岸政府敌视中国的政策
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会在15日举行的全国理事会会议上通过一项声明，表示要坚决为反对修改日美“安全条约”和争取日中外交关系正常化而斗争。
    声明说，日中友好协会将展开运动，来粉碎反华宣传和击败岸信介政府的敌视中国的政策。
    声明警告说，如果岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋得逞，那么，日中关系将进一步恶化，日本的和平和独立将被军国主义分子所断送。
    声明强调说，修改日美“安全条约”是同总的国际趋势背道而驰的，因为它的目的是进攻中国、苏联和其他亚洲国家。
    全国理事会会议一致认为，同过去十年期间开展的同样的运动相比较，今年10月和11月开展的争取日中邦交正常化的运动是最富有成果的。会议强调指出，把争取恢复日中外交关系的斗争同制止岸信介政府修改“安全条约”的运动紧密地结合在一起，是今年开展的这一运动的重要方面。
      日共参议员须藤五郎揭露
    岸政府协助美军在南越调查
    充当美军在远东侵略的帮凶
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党参议员须藤五郎10日在参议院递信委员会会议上揭露了日本政府为美军在南越调查建设通讯设施的工作，帮助了美军在远东进行军事行动。
    须藤说，日本官方经营的日本电信电话公司曾经派遣调查团到南越为美军建设超短波通讯设施进行调查工作。参加这个调查团的还有美军远东司令部和驻日美军军事顾问团以及南越陆军人员。
    须藤指出，这个调查团还协助美军调查了有关南越的电力、军用通讯的情况和交通机关的状态。须藤指出，日本电信电话公司还为驻日美军担任了在菲律宾、台湾、南朝鲜和泰国进行的类似工作。
          美国“纽约邮报”供认
      新日美军事条约以中苏为敌
        并把侵略矛头指向远东各国
    本报讯　最近美国和日本报刊在报道日美签订新的“安全条约”时透露，新的日美条约是不折不扣的以中苏和亚洲人民为敌的军事侵略同盟条约。
    12月11日美国“纽约邮报”在“华盛顿消息”栏中报道日美签订新条约时透露，美国将利用新的“安全条约”进一步复活日本军国主义，同中苏为敌。这家报纸说，签订这项条约的结果，日本可能从美国取得经济和技术援助“来建立一支强大的陆海空军部队，其中包括许多航空母舰和至少一艘核潜水艇。”它并且说，日本拥有“这种增强了的军事力量的目的”，是为了同中苏“抗衡”。
    “纽约邮报”还证实，美国通过修改后的日美“安全条约”实际上结成东北亚军事同盟，并且把它同东南亚条约组织联结起来，使日本充当美国的亚洲宪兵。据这家报纸说，新的日美“安全条约”适用范围包括朝鲜、台湾、越南、老挝和东南亚条约组织的成员国。
