Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 12th. Choi Won-tak, Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement today, strongly condemning the South Korean authorities' illegal confiscation of letters from the Supreme People's Assembly to members of the South Korean "National Assembly" and people from all walks of life. He also demanded the immediate delivery of the illegally confiscated letters to the relevant recipients.

Choi Won-tak said that in October of this year, the Sixth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea adopted letters to the members of the "Republic of Korea National Assembly" and the people of South Korea on the issue of peaceful reunification of the motherland. However, the South Korean authorities once again rejected the unanimous desire of all Korean people for peaceful reunification of the motherland, and did their utmost to prevent these letters from reaching the members of the South Korean "National Assembly" and people from all walks of life.

According to South Korean sources, the South Korean authorities confiscated more than 1,900 of the aforementioned letters on November 30th and December 1st alone, attempting to suppress the growing national aspiration for peaceful reunification of the motherland among the South Korean people through such despicable methods.

Choi Won-tak pointed out that all Korean people will struggle more resolutely to realize the plan for peaceful reunification of the motherland as outlined in the letters of the Supreme People's Assembly.

    崔元泽就南朝鲜没收信件发表谈话
    谴责李承晚集团阻挠和平统一
    新华社平壤电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议议长崔元泽12日发表谈话，强烈谴责南朝鲜当局非法没收最高人民会议给南朝鲜“国会”议员和各界人民的信这一行动，并且要求立即把非法没收的信件交给有关的收信人。
    崔元泽说，今年10月，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第二届最高人民会议第六次会议曾经通过了就和平统一祖国问题写给“大韩民国国会”议员和南朝鲜人民的信件，但是，南朝鲜当局又一次拒绝了全体朝鲜人民一致要求和平统一祖国的愿望，竭力阻挠这些信件转到南朝鲜“国会”议员和各界人民手中。
    据南朝鲜消息，南朝鲜当局仅在11月30日和12月1日两天，就没收了一千九百多封上述信件，企图以这种卑鄙的方法来压制在南朝鲜人民中日益高涨的迫切要求和平统一祖国的民族愿望。
    崔元泽指出，全体朝鲜人民将为了实现最高人民会议在信中阐明的和平统一祖国的方案更加坚决斗争。
