Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 27th (By our correspondent): In 1959, the people of North Korea, during the Chollima Movement to build socialism, launched a high tide of industrial and agricultural production and achieved tremendous accomplishments.

The North Korean people have already completed the first Five-Year Plan's total industrial output value target two and a half years ahead of schedule in June this year. Under the wise leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, the North Korean working class has achieved an average annual growth rate of 42% in total industrial output value since the war; this year, they will increase the total industrial output value by 50% compared to last year.

The unprecedented high-speed development of North Korean industry in 1959 has brought about significant changes in the North Korean industry. Over the past year, North Korea has further expanded and strengthened its heavy industrial base in the north, and has focused on developing the weak links of North Korea's industry in the past - the machine manufacturing industry. Currently, North Korea's machine manufacturing industry is already able to produce many kinds of modern production equipment and heavy machinery on its own. This has thoroughly eliminated the colonial nature of North Korea's economy caused by the long-term rule of Japanese imperialists.

This year, North Korea focused its efforts on developing heavy industrial sectors such as steel, machinery, and electricity. In terms of developing the steel industry, North Korea has restored, expanded, and newly built many metallurgical and steel rolling facilities this year. The Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works has restored and rebuilt two blast furnaces with a total production capacity of 700,000 tons this year and put them into operation. Together with the expanded blast furnace at the Hwanghae Iron Works, North Korea now has three modern blast furnaces flowing with large amounts of molten iron simultaneously. By the end of this year, the average daily output of these three blast furnaces has reached three times that of before liberation.

The Seongjin, Gangseon, and Cheongjin steel mills have each newly built steel rolling workshops, electric furnaces, and converters. These new production facilities will exert greater power in North Korea's steel production next year.

Since May this year, a movement to produce machine tools with machine tools has been launched in North Korea, which has greatly promoted the development of North Korea's machine manufacturing industry and the technological revolution in industry. According to the plan, North Korea aims to double the number of existing machine tools within one year through this movement. In the first six months after the start of the movement, North Korea has already produced 11,000 machine tools and simple machine tools.

The rapid development of local industries is an important achievement North Korea has made this year. It is estimated that the output value of local industries in North Korea this year will account for 34% of the total industrial output value, and consumer goods produced by local industries will account for 54% of the total output of consumer goods in the country. Since the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea called on the entire people to run local industries in June this year, more than 1,000 local industries have been established in half a year, forming a local industrial system.

This year, North Korea has also made great achievements in capital construction. The Guiseong Machine Tool Factory with an annual output of 1,000 machine tools, the automated "February 8" Madong Cement Factory, two railway factories in Pyongyang and Wonsan, the Pyongyang Metrology Factory, and the Kilju Plywood Factory, etc., have been completed and put into operation this year. The Turu River Power Station, designed by North Korea itself, has also been completed and generated electricity this year. This year, North Korean youth also built a 50-kilometer-long railway between Pyeongsan and Yichari.

In terms of agricultural production, North Korea has achieved bumper harvests of grain, oil crops, flax and other fiber crops, and fruits this year. Due to the implementation of deep plowing, close planting, and increased fertilization methods in agricultural cooperatives in various regions, the grain yield per unit area in North Korea this year has increased by 17.6% compared to last year. The famous rice-producing areas in North Korea - Namri Plain, Twelve Thousand Miles Plain, and Uiju Plain - have all achieved large-scale bumper harvests.

This year, the water conservancy, electrification, and mechanization movements launched in the rural areas of North Korea have all achieved significant achievements and progress. The large-scale water conservancy campaign carried out last winter and this spring has increased the irrigated area in North Korea by 377,000 jeongbo (one jeongbo is approximately equal to 15 mu), allowing more than 800,000 jeongbo of fertile land out of North Korea's 2 million jeongbo of cultivated land to be irrigated, which has created favorable conditions for the rapid development of North Korean agriculture. To date, 88% of the ri (i.e., townships) in North Korea's rural areas have electricity. The agricultural mechanization work is currently being carried out comprehensively in North Korea. Local factories in various regions are manufacturing agricultural machinery and tools in large quantities to support the peasant brothers.

　　朝鲜工农业生产齐奏凯歌
    工业产值将跃增百分之五十农作物获得丰收
    重工业基地进一步扩大地方工业体系已形成
    新华社平壤27日电　本社记者报道：1959年，朝鲜人民在建设社会主义的千里马运动中，掀起了工农业的生产高潮，取得了巨大的成就。
    朝鲜人民已经在今年6月提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划。朝鲜工人阶级在朝鲜劳动党的英明领导下，战后以来曾使每年工业总产值的增长速度，平均达到42％；而今年，他们将使工业总产值比去年跃增50％。
    1959年朝鲜工业的空前高速度发展，使朝鲜工业发生了重大的变化。一年来，朝鲜北部进一步扩大和加强了它的重工业基地，并且着重发展了过去朝鲜工业的薄弱环节——机器制造业。目前，朝鲜的机器制造业已经能够自己生产许多种现代化的生产设备和重型机械。这样就彻底消除了由于日本帝国主义者的长期统治所造成的朝鲜经济的殖民地性质。
    今年，朝鲜北部集中力量发展了钢铁、机械、电力等重工业部门。在发展钢铁工业方面，朝鲜北部今年恢复、扩建和新建了很多冶金和轧钢设备。金策制铁所今年恢复和改建了两座生产能力共达七十万吨的高炉，并且投入生产。这样，加上黄海制铁所扩建后的高炉，朝鲜北部已经有三座现代化高炉同时奔流着大量铁水。到今年年底，这三座高炉的平均日产量达到解放前的三倍。
    城津、降仙、清津三个炼钢厂都分别新建了轧钢车间、电炉和转炉。这些新的生产设备将在明年朝鲜北部的钢的生产中发挥更大的威力。
    从今年5月开始，在朝鲜北部展开了机床生产机床的运动，这个运动大大推动了朝鲜机器制造工业的发展和工业的技术革命。根据计划，朝鲜北部要在这个运动中使现有的机床数在一年内增加一倍。在运动开始后的头六个月内，朝鲜北部各地已经生产了一万一千台机床和简易机床。
    地方工业的迅速发展是朝鲜北部今年取得的重要成就。预计今年朝鲜北部地方工业的产值将占工业总产值的34％，地方工业生产的消费品将占全国消费品总产量的54％。自从今年6月朝鲜劳动党中央全会号召全民办地方工业后，在半年的时间内就创建了一千多个地方工业。已形成了地方工业体系。
    今年，朝鲜北部的基本建设也取得了很大成就。今年内建成投入生产的有年产一千台机床的龟城机床厂、生产设备自动化的“二·八”马洞水泥厂、平壤和元山的两个铁道工厂、平壤度量衡厂、吉州胶板厂等。由朝鲜自己设计的秃鲁江发电站也在今年建成发电。今年，朝鲜青年们还修建了一条平山一支下里间的长五十公里的铁路。
    在农业生产方面，朝鲜北部今年的粮食、油脂作物、亚麻等纤维作物以及水果等都获得了丰收。由于各地农业社实行了深耕、密植、多施肥料的耕作方法，今年朝鲜北部的粮食单位面积产量比去年增加了17.6％。朝鲜北部著名的水稻产区—那慕里平原、十二三千里平原、威州平原都获得了大面积丰收。
    今年在朝鲜北部农村中展开的水利化、电气化、机械化运动都取得了重大的成就和进展。去冬今春大搞水利化运动，使朝鲜北部的灌溉面积猛增了三十七万七千町步（一町步约合十五市亩），使朝鲜北部二百万町步耕地中有八十多万町步的良田可以得到灌溉，这就为朝鲜农业的迅速发展创造了有利条件。到目前为止，朝鲜北部农村88％的里（即乡）有了电。农业机械化工作目前正在朝鲜北部全面展开。各地的地方工厂都在大量制造农业机械和农具，支援农民兄弟。
