    "Guard the Three Passes, Eliminate the Source of Bacteria" for the Prevention and Control of Wheat Stripe Rust
    Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture
    Wheat stripe rust is a historical wheat disease in Shaanxi Province. In the two years of 1957-1958, the province's wheat production was reduced by more than 500 million catties due to the damage of stripe rust. In 1959, the disease situation was even more serious. However, under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, and based on the laws of disease prevalence over the years, we relied on the masses and boldly created prevention and control methods that focused on eliminating the source of bacteria, and launched a large-scale mass prevention and control movement. Therefore, in this year of large-scale outbreak of stripe rust, we still ensured a bumper wheat harvest.
    
    Three Stages, One Effort
    
    After autumn wheat seedlings emerged in 1958, the Guanzhong area suffered from the invasion of a large number of stripe rust bacteria. The diseased area before winter reached more than 6 million mu, of which 2.5 million mu were lightly affected, 3 million mu were heavily affected, 500,000 mu were severely affected, and more than 5,000 mu were most severely affected (the entire field was generally diseased).
    
    Under such circumstances, in order to actively eliminate wheat stripe rust, we divided the field prevention and control work into three stages:
    
    The first stage was to start early and seize the prevention and control of eliminating the source of bacteria before winter. From the beginning of November last year, all wheat-growing areas in the province mobilized more than 1 million people to use the "burying soil and cutting leaves" method to comprehensively treat the 6 million mu of diseased wheat fields, some of which were treated two to three times. Under the slogan of "Don't stop eliminating rust until the heavy snow covers the ground," all localities persisted in the prevention and control work until the end of the year.
    
    The second stage was to continue carrying out large-scale prevention and control under the call of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee to "Mobilize the whole people to vow to eliminate wheat stripe rust at the greening stage." In this stage (until the end of March), all localities mobilized more than 2 million people to use methods such as spraying ammonium sulfate water and raw urine water as pesticides, treating a small patch when a single plant was found, and treating a large patch when a small patch was found, universally treating the 1.77 million mu of diseased wheat once or twice, and some areas three to five times. In this stage, because of the special focus on eliminating the bacteria on the disease transmission base, the spread of the disease was effectively controlled.
    
    The third stage began in early April during the wheat heading stage. At that time, the slogan was: "Make one effort to win the final battle to eliminate stripe rust." In the last month of prevention and control, 3.21 million people were mobilized successively to use protective sprays to treat the 6.1 million mu of wheat fields three to five times.
    
    This year's wheat rust prevention movement in Shaanxi has persisted for more than six months, using more than 5 million catties of various chemical pesticides, more than 160 million catties of native pesticides, and creating more than 168,000 various native implements. During the tense stage of prevention and control work, three aircraft were also dispatched to treat 429,000 mu-times. On the whole, the prevention and control effect is very significant. For example, in Huazhou Commune, Weinan, the average thousand-grain weight of wheat was 28.6 grams last year due to the damage of stripe rust; the wheat grains after this year's prevention and control are full, and the thousand-grain weight generally reaches 31 to 34 grams. The total output of 100,000 mu of "Bima No. 1" winter wheat in the whole commune can be increased by more than 4 million catties. The masses generally reflect:
    
    "If it weren't for the government's leadership in preventing and controlling 'jaundice' (i.e., stripe rust), how could we have such good grains this year."
    
    Three Experiences, Leadership Takes the Lead
    
    How did this year's great achievements in the prevention and control of wheat stripe rust come about?
    
    First, put politics in command, strengthen leadership, and launch a large-scale mass movement.
    
    In order to strive for a greater wheat harvest this year, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee listed the elimination of wheat stripe rust as an important measure to ensure a bumper wheat harvest in Shaanxi Province. Starting last autumn, various localities carried out a series of publicity and mobilization activities, and held rust prevention professional meetings, on-site meetings, telephone conferences, and oath-taking rallies at all levels. In many areas, debates were also launched in this work to criticize "condition-ism," "foreign drug-ism," and "technical backwardness," and to deeply mobilize the masses and enhance confidence through concrete examples, comparative accounting. During the movement, the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and the Governor personally went to various places to inspect; the four levels of county (city), commune, management area, and production team took the lead, with the four leaders personally responsible, dividing the area and contracting tasks, dividing the passes and controlling the mouths, and dividing the lines to carry out the work. In order to give play to the role of grassroots organizations, all localities established professional teams with the production team as the unit, and set up a reconnaissance member for every 100 mu to achieve "leaders at every level, generals in every area, and soldiers in every block." In the prevention and control work, the method of majority prevention and control and professional teams sweeping up the remnants was also adopted to combine blitz prevention and control with regular and continuous prevention and control. We also carried out large-scale joint prevention, large-scale appraisal, and large-scale competitions throughout the province. A total of 16 joint prevention areas were established in 52 counties (cities) in the province. Joint prevention was also organized between communes and teams within the county (city), and inspections and appraisals were carried out, making the masses' enthusiasm greater and greater and the movement wave higher and higher.
    
    Second, master the development law of stripe rust and find out the prevention and control strategy of "guarding the three passes" to eliminate the source of bacteria in large quantities.
    
    After several years, especially the observation of the occurrence of wheat stripe rust last winter and this spring, the prevalence of wheat rust in the Guanzhong area is mainly due to the gradual reproduction and spread of bacteria on local autumn seedlings after overwintering. According to actual surveys in various localities, the bacteria that start activity in autumn first harm early-sown wheat fields, and then spread locally, forming single diseased leaves and disease transmission centers; and continuously infect and overwinter. Therefore, thoroughly eliminating the source of bacteria on autumn seedlings or early spring overwintering can effectively control the prevalence and harm of the disease. This is the basis for our adoption of the "eliminating the source of bacteria to control disease transmission" approach. After wheat turns green, the bacteria spread rapidly in local areas, forming several severely diseased areas; at the same time, due to the rapid growth of wheat during the jointing stage, the disease gradually shifts to the upper part of the wheat plant, and bacterial spores can spread with the wind, expanding and spreading to the surrounding area. Therefore, these early severely diseased areas become the disease transmission base. According to this situation, we took the work of seizing the disease transmission base to eliminate the source of bacteria, and comprehensively sprayed pesticides on it. This has played a great role in comprehensively controlling the disease prevalence. During the wheat heading stage, the temperature generally rises, the field humidity in dry land and sloping fields is relatively small, and the disease gradually turns lighter; along the river valley land and low-lying land on the plateau, the disease gradually becomes heavier due to the higher humidity. Mastering this law and making early arrangements to seize the comprehensive protection of the later diseased areas by spraying protectants is an effective measure to reduce harm. According to the above-mentioned law of occurrence and development of stripe rust, we formulated the prevention and control measures of "guarding the three passes and eliminating the source of bacteria": seizing early-sown wheat fields before winter to eliminate the overwintering source of bacteria; seizing the disease transmission base during the wheat greening period to control the spread of the disease; seizing the comprehensive protection of low-lying and humid areas during the heading stage to reduce harm.
    
    Third, start with local methods, combine local and foreign methods, and improve the prevention and control effect.
    
    In terms of prevention and control technology, we implemented the combination of artificial and chemical agents, the combination of local and foreign drugs, and the combination of local tools and aircraft prevention and control. In the current situation where there are no better prevention and control drugs, we adopted the local method of "burying soil and cutting leaves" before winter to eliminate the source of bacteria according to the law that stripe rust bacteria are easy to fly and live in living organisms. Although this is labor-intensive, each person can treat more than ten mu per day under skilled technical conditions. When disease transmission centers appear, the use of 3% ammonium sulfate water, 1:1 raw urine water, and 5% superphosphate water and other pesticides to kill diseased leaves and eliminate bacteria is very effective in eliminating the spread of disease, treating the elimination of disease transmission centers as a fortress to attack. The masses reflect that these are "local methods with foreign principles." A large number of protectants and native pesticides such as "lime sulfur mixture", castor leaf water, cypress leaf water, *Maguan Chang*, *Mao Eryan* water, etc. are sprayed during the wheat heading stage, and the effect is very good. In terms of the use of tools, on the one hand, we gave play to the role of existing sprayers, and on the other hand, we mobilized the masses to create local tools.
    
    Although our province has achieved great results and gained some experience in the prevention and control of wheat stripe rust this year, stripe rust has not been completely eliminated, and this is only the beginning of our work to eliminate wheat stripe rust. We must continue to strengthen prevention and control and further accumulate experience. (Attached picture)

    “守三关，灭菌源”防治条锈病
    陕西省农业厅
    小麦条锈病是陕西省历史性的小麦病害。1957—1958年两年内，曾因条锈病的危害，全省共减产小麦达五亿多斤。1959年发病情况更为严重，但由于在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我们根据历年病害流行的规律，依靠群众，大胆创用以消灭菌源为主的防治方法，开展了大规模群众性的防治运动，因此在今年条锈病大发生的年份里，仍保证了小麦的大丰收。
    三个阶段，一鼓作气
    1958年秋麦苗出土以后，关中地区即遭受大量条锈病菌的侵染。冬前发病面积达六百多万亩，其中较轻的二百五十万亩，较重的三百万亩，严重的五十万亩，最重的五千多亩（全田普遍发病）。
    在这种情况下，为了主动地消灭条锈病，我们在田间防治工作上分了这样三个阶段：
    第一个阶段是及早动手，抓紧冬前消灭菌源的防治。全省各麦区从去年11月上旬就动员了一百多万人次，采用“埋土切叶”的方法，将六百万亩发病麦田全面防治一遍，有的治过二到三次。在“大雪不盖地，灭锈不停止”的号召下，各地一直把防治工作坚持到年底。
    第二个阶段是在3月初在省委、省人委发出“全民动员誓把小麦条锈病消灭在返青关”的号召下，继续开展大规模的防治。在这个阶段（至3月底），各地共出动二百多万人次，采用喷洒硫酸铵水、生尿水等杀伤剂的办法，发现一株治一片，发现小片治大片，把发病的一百七十七万亩小麦普遍防治一到二次，部分地区防治三到五次。这一阶段，由于特别抓住消灭传病基地上的病菌，因此有效地控制了病害的传播。
    第三阶段是在4月上旬小麦孕穗期开始的。当时，提出的口号是：“一鼓作气，打胜消灭条锈病最后一仗”。在最后防治的一个月里，先后出动三百二十一万人次，采用喷洒保护剂的办法，给发病的六百一十万亩麦田防治三到五次。
    今年陕西防治小麦锈病运动一直坚持了六个多月，使用各种化学农药五百多万斤，土农药一万六千多万斤，创制各种土器械十六万八千多件，在防治工作紧张阶段还出动了飞机三架，防治了四十二万九千亩次。总的来看，防治效果很显著，如渭南的华州公社去年因条锈病为害，小麦千粒重平均为二十八点六克；今年防治后的小麦颗粒饱满，千粒重一般达到三十一到三十四克，全社十万亩“碧蚂一号”冬麦总计可增产四百多万斤。群众普遍反映：
    “要不是政府领导防治‘黄疸’（即条锈病），今年咋能有这样的好颗颗。”
    三条经验，领导当先
    今年防治小麦条锈病的巨大成绩是怎样得来的呢？
    第一、政治挂帅，加强领导，大搞群众运动。
    中共陕西省委和省人委为了争取今年小麦的更大丰收，把消灭小麦条锈病列为陕西省保证小麦丰收的一项重要措施。从去秋开始，各地进行了一系列的宣传动员工作，逐级召开防锈专业会、现场会、电话会、誓师会等。许多地区在这项工作中，还展开辩论，批判了“唯条件论”“唯洋药论”和“技术落后论”，通过具体事例，对比算账，深入发动群众，提高信心。在运动中，省委书记、省长亲赴各地检查；县（市）、社、管理区、生产队四级书记挂帅，四长亲自负责，划片包干，分关把口，分线进行。为了发挥基层组织的作用，各地都以生产队为单位建立专业队，每百亩设置一名侦察员，做到“层层有帅，片片有将，块块有兵”。在防治工作中还采用了多数人防治，专业队扫残的办法，使突击防治和经常持续防治相结合。我们还在全省范围里，开展了大联防、大评比、大竞赛，全省五十二个县（市）共成立十六个联防区。县（市）内社、队之间也组成联防，开展检查评比，使群众干劲越来越大，运动浪潮愈来愈高。
    第二、掌握条锈病发展规律，摸出“守三关”大量消灭菌源的防治策略。
    经过几年来特别是去冬今春的小麦条锈病发生情况的观察，小麦锈病在关中地区的流行，主要是由当地秋苗上的病菌越冬后逐渐繁殖蔓延而来的。据各地实际调查，秋季开始活动的病菌是先在早播麦田为害，随后就地蔓延传播，形成单病叶片和传病中心；并以连续侵染越过冬季。因此彻底消灭秋苗上的或早春越冬的菌源，就能有效地控制病害的流行为害。这就是我们采用的“灭菌源控制病害传播”作法的依据。小麦返青后病菌在局部地区内迅速蔓延，形成若干严重发病地带；同时由于小麦拔节阶段迅速生长，病害逐渐向麦株上部转移，病菌孢子能够随风传播，向四周扩大蔓延。因此这些早期严重发病的地带就成为传病基地。根据这一情况，我们采取了抓紧传病基地消灭菌源的工作，对它全面喷杀伤剂。这样对全面控制病害流行起了很大的作用。小麦孕穗期，气温普遍升高，旱塬、坡地田间湿度较小，病势逐渐转轻；沿河川道地、塬上低洼地，由于湿度较大，病势渐重。掌握这一规律，及早安排抓紧后期发病地区的全面喷保护剂，是减少为害的有效措施。根据以上所说的条锈病发生发展的规律，我们制定了“守三关，灭菌源”的防治措施：冬前抓早播麦田，消灭越冬菌源；小麦返青期，抓传病基地，控制病害传播；孕穗期抓低湿地区全面保护，减少为害。
    第三、土法上马，土洋结合，提高防治效果。
    在防治技术上我们贯彻了人工和药剂相结合，土药和洋药相结合，土工具和飞机防治相结合的方法。在当前没有更好的防治药剂的情况下，我们根据条锈病菌易于飞散和活物寄生的规律，冬前采用了“埋土切叶”，消灭菌源的土办法。这样虽然费工，但在技术熟练情况下，每人每天可防治十多亩。传病中心出现时，采用3％的硫酸铵水，一比一的生尿水，5％过磷酸钙水等杀伤剂，杀死病叶，消灭病菌，把消灭传病中心当做堡垒去攻打，对消灭病害传播效果很好。群众反映这些是“土办法，洋道理”。小麦孕穗期大量喷保护剂及土农药如“石硫合剂”、蓖麻叶水、柏树叶水、马灌肠、猫儿眼水等，效果都很好。使用工具方面，一面发挥现有喷雾器的作用，一面发动群众创造土工具。
    我省今年防治小麦条锈病，虽然获得了很大成绩，取得了一些经验，但条锈病还没有彻底消灭，而且这仅是我们消灭小麦条锈病工作的开始，还必须继续加强防治，进一步积累经验。（附图片）
