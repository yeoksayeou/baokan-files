Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, December 25th: The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has comprehensively fulfilled this year's national plan and increased production plan ahead of schedule, achieving a major victory in continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959. As of December 23, the plant's total output value has exceeded the annual plan by 10.7%, the production of "Liberation" brand trucks has exceeded the annual plan by 1.5%, cross-country vehicles have fulfilled the plan, various engines have exceeded the annual plan by 27%, product costs have been reduced by 2.6% compared to the plan, and labor productivity has increased by 10.6% compared to the plan.

Adhering to putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out mass movements are important experiences for the First Automobile Works in achieving continued leaps forward this year. Since the beginning of this year, the plant's Party Committee has further implemented the general line of socialist construction, constantly combating Right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale. In all aspects of work, it has insisted on vigorously carrying out mass movements, thereby significantly improving the plant's production level, technical level, and management level. After the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the political consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the plant's workers were further heightened, further launching a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy. Starting in September, the plant adopted the form of "great battle" and large-scale technical performance competitions, pushing this movement to a new peak and making the mass movement develop in a more comprehensive, larger, broader, and deeper manner. The number of cars produced by the plant from September to December 23 was equivalent to the total output from January to August, with an average production increase of one time.

Over the past year, the technical innovation and technical revolution have been vigorously carried out in the plant's mass movement. These innovations have ranged from small to large, from single machines to production lines, from general to sophisticated, and from individual to collective, combining large, medium, and small scales, and blossoming everywhere. According to statistics, since October alone, the plant's workers have put forward more than 42,000 technical innovation and rationalization proposals, of which more than 16,000 have been implemented. The result of a large number of innovative technologies is that they broke through production bottlenecks, overcame weak links in production, and greatly improved production capacity. Last year, the plant increased the output of cars to 100 per shift on the basis of the original design of 50 cars per shift; at the end of this year, the plant basically reached the level of 150 cars per shift.

This year, the plant also began batch production of "Red Flag" high-end sedans and three-axle off-road vehicles, achieving a victory in producing a variety of cars. The batch production of "Red Flag" sedans marks a leap forward in the level of China's automobile industry. (Attached picture)

Workers in the general assembly workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have greatly reduced the assembly time of trucks from four minutes per vehicle to about three minutes per vehicle due to vigorous technical innovation.

　　第一汽车厂群众运动硕果满枝
    全年生产计划提前完成　新型汽车开始成批生产
    新华社长春25日电　第一汽车制造厂已经提前全面完成今年全年国家计划和增产计划，取得了1959年继续跃进的重大胜利。截至12月23日，全厂完成的总产值已经超过年计划10.7％，解放牌汽车产量超过年计划1.5％，越野车完成计划，各种发动机超过年计划27％，产品成本比计划降低2.6％，劳动生产率比计划提高10.6％。
    坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，是第一汽车厂取得今年继续跃进成就的重要经验。今年以来，这个厂的党委进一步贯彻了社会主义建设总路线，不断反右倾、鼓干劲，在各项工作中都坚持大搞群众运动，因此显著地提高了全厂的生产水平、技术水平和管理水平。党的八届八中全会决议公布后，全厂职工的政治觉悟和劳动热情更加高涨，进一步掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。从9月开始，全厂采用“大会战”和技术表演大竞赛的形式，把这一运动推向新的高峰，使群众运动更全更大更广更深地发展。全厂从9月到12月23日出产的汽车，就相当于1月到8月产量的总和，生产平均提高一倍。
    一年来，全厂在大搞群众运动中，技术革新和技术革命蓬勃展开。这些革新从小到大、从台到线、从一般到精尖、从个别到集体，大中小结合，遍地开花结果。据统计，仅10月份以来，全厂职工就提出技术革新合理化建议四万二千多件，实现了一万六千多件。大量革新技术的结果，冲破了生产关键，克服了生产薄弱环节，使生产能力大大提高。去年这个厂曾在原设计班产五十辆汽车的基础上，把汽车产量提高到班产一百辆；今年年末全厂又基本上达到了班产一百五十辆的水平。
    今年，这个厂还开始成批生产“红旗”牌高级轿车和三轴越野车，取得了生产多品种汽车的胜利。成批生产“红旗”轿车，标志着我国汽车工业水平的飞跃提高。（附图片）
