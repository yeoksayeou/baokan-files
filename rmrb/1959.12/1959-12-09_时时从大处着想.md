"Leave the difficulties to yourself and offer convenience to others." This is the attitude of Communist Party member Tu Zhengu towards others.

Tu Zhengu is a cotton-planting expert and the Party Branch Secretary of Xinchang Brigade, Chengguan Commune, Shimen County, Hunan. She never stands idly by when she sees others in difficulty. In July of this year, when the drought was very severe, the brigade bought a water pump from the county. The machine had been transported to the Lishui River by their brigade, ready to be installed, and the commune members were very excited. At this time, she heard that the drought situation in the Hongqi Brigade was even more serious than theirs, so she decided to give the water pump to the Hongqi Brigade. Since the onset of the drought, the commune members who had been persistently drawing water from the river to fight the drought couldn't understand why the machine that had already been transported back to the brigade should be given to the Hongqi Brigade. She and the general branch secretary, Qu Xuesong, patiently explained to the commune members and took the lead in leading them to fight the drought.

Tu Zhengu also selflessly passed on her cotton-planting experience to others. Tangshi Brigade is a new cotton area, and women's team leader Liu Guangying led the women of the team to cultivate dozens of mu of high-yield cotton fields and started a competition with Tu Zhengu. In March, they sent eight women to Tu Zhengu to learn cotton-planting techniques. In addition to telling them every bit of her experience in deep plowing, close planting, seedling cultivation, and pest control, Tu Zhengu also encouraged them to be confident and catch up with her. With Tu Zhengu's enthusiastic help, they not only cultivated large areas of high-yield cotton fields, but also planted 310 cotton "satellite seedlings" per person. However, soon after they were planted, the "satellite seedlings" all died from sun exposure. Liu Guangying ran breathlessly from more than twenty miles away and found Tu Zhengu in the cotton field. When Tu Zhengu heard about it, she felt uneasy as if the cotton in her own field had died. After asking in detail, she learned that too much un-decomposed pig and cattle manure had been applied, and the cotton was burned to death by the sun. So, Tu Zhengu told them how to remedy the situation. After Liu Guangying returned to the brigade, she took remedial measures according to the method Tu Zhengu had taught them, and the results were very good.

Jiang Daichun, the leader of the women's team of Lingshui Brigade in Zaoshi Commune, is also a competitor of Tu Zhengu. This spring, she organized a "Ten Sisters" cotton-planting team and cultivated more than 30 mu of high-yield cotton fields, determined to surpass Tu Zhengu. Tu Zhengu was also very concerned about the growth of Jiang Daichun's cotton. One day, she made a special trip to visit the cotton field cultivated by Jiang Daichun's Ten Sisters. It was after the rain, and Jiang Daichun was leading the members of the team to plant broad beans. Tu Zhengu carefully checked a cotton plant and found that seven cotton bolls had been damaged by bollworms. If the pests were not caught immediately, it would affect the cotton yield. Tu Zhengu immediately told Jiang Daichun to control the pests immediately and told them how to control the pests, so that the pests could be eliminated in time. (Attached picture)

    时时从大处着想
    “把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人。”这是共产党员涂珍姑对待别人的态度。
    涂珍姑是湖南石门县城关公社新厂大队的植棉能手，又是党支部书记。她看到别人有困难，从不袖手旁观。今年7月，正当干旱十分严重的时候，队上从县里买回了一部抽水机，机器已运到他们这个大队的澧水河边，只待安装，社员们都非常兴奋。这时，她听说红旗大队的旱情比他们还严重，就决定把这部抽水机让给红旗大队。从旱象发生以来，一直坚持在河边车水抗旱的社员，听说要将已经运回队里的机器让给红旗大队，一时都想不通。她和总支书记屈学松耐心地向社员们进行了解释，并带头领导社员们抗旱。
    自己的植棉经验，涂珍姑也无私地传给别人。塘市大队是个新棉区，妇女大队长刘光英带领全队妇女培育了几十亩棉花丰产地，和涂珍姑展开了竞赛。3月份，她们就派了八个妇女向涂珍姑去学习种棉技术。涂珍姑除把自己深耕、密植、育苗、治虫等一点一滴的经验都告诉她们外，还鼓励她们坚定信心，赶上自己。她们在涂珍姑的热情帮助下，除培育了大片棉花丰产地，每人还栽了三百一十蔸棉花“卫星蔸”。可是刚栽下去不久，太阳一晒，“卫星蔸”棉花全死啦。刘光英气喘喘地从二十多里远的地方跑来，在棉花地里找到涂珍姑。涂珍姑听说后，就好像自己地里的棉花死了一样，非常不安。经过详细地询问以后，才知道原来是没有经过腐烂的猪牛粪下得太多，太阳一晒，把棉花全烧坏了。于是，涂珍姑就告诉她们补救的办法。刘光英回到队里以后，就按照涂珍姑讲的办法进行补救，效果很好。
    皂市公社领水大队妇女队长江代春，也是涂珍姑的一个竞赛对手。今年春天，她组织了一个“十姐妹”植棉专业队，培育了三十多亩棉花丰产田，决心要赛过涂珍姑。涂珍姑对江代春的棉花生长也非常关心。有一天，她特地跑到江代春十姐妹培育的棉花地里去参观。这时正是雨后，江代春领导专业队的社员种蚕豆去了。涂珍姑仔细地检查了一蔸棉花，发现有七个棉桃被金钢钻虫损坏了，如果不立即捉虫，就会影响棉花的产量。涂珍姑马上告诉江代春要立即治虫，并且告诉她们治虫的方法，使虫害能够及时扑灭。（附图片）
