How Anhui's Education Work Leapt Forward
Director of the Education Department of Anhui Province Ding Mingzhi

   Since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, and under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line for the transition period and the general line for socialist construction, with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and continuous efforts, we have basically changed the backward old face of education in Anhui. Now, compared with 1949, the number of students in universities has increased twentyfold, the number of students in secondary schools has increased elevenfold, primary education has been universalized, and spare-time education has greatly developed. As for the achievements in teaching and education work, judging from the results of high school graduates participating in the national university entrance examination, Anhui, which has always been backward, has been able to advance shoulder to shoulder with advanced brother provinces and cities this year.

   Why is it that teaching and education quality can also leap forward in the case of poor foundation and poor conditions? Our experience mainly includes the following points:

   The Party Effectively Grasps the Leadership of Schools

   Liberate thoughts, boldly promote and use cadres, and the Party effectively grasps the leadership of schools. Since 1952, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee has successively transferred Party member cadres to schools to take on leadership work, so that all secondary and higher schools have Party member principals or vice-principals. In 1958, according to the specific situation of our province, corresponding clear regulations were made on the political and cultural conditions of the cadres transferred to the schools, adhering to the principle of "sending them in first, then training and improving them"; emphasizing that Party committees at all levels should take action to make comprehensive arrangements, and in one fell swoop, equip Party member principals for universities, middle schools, and most primary schools, and successively establish Party leadership cores for most middle schools and university departments. From May to October 1958 alone, the province transferred more than 10,000 Party member cadres to schools at all levels, thus solving the fundamental problem of guaranteeing the Party's leadership over school work from the organizational level.

   We provide newly dispatched Party member cadres to schools with training and improvement in many ways. In addition to constantly encouraging them politically and ideologically, we also continuously improve their professional level through methods such as exchanging experiences, visiting and learning, and short-term training. Thanks to the Party's care and cultivation and their hard work in work practice, they have gradually become familiar with school operations.

   We also timely reversed the view of some educational administrative departments and schools that only emphasized professional work and not politics. On this basis, we boldly promoted teachers who had good politics, progressive thinking, and were willing to delve into their profession, to serve as teaching and research group leaders, class teachers, and other positions. Experience tells us that strengthening the Party's leadership over school work is a fundamental guarantee for rapidly improving teaching quality and running schools well; and organizational construction is a fundamental measure for realizing the Party's leadership.

   Putting Politics in Command Establishes the Determination to Strive for the Top

   Education is a mass undertaking. Fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people and the vast number of teachers and students is an important condition for running education well. Therefore, we must adhere to putting politics in command, with ideological work taking the lead, actively mobilize the masses, continuously oppose rightism, encourage vigor, and establish the determination to overcome difficulties and strive for the top. In Anhui, the long-term and prominent obstacle of right-leaning thought is "the theory of conditions." Therefore, the Party has conducted repeated struggles against "the theory of conditions" in ideological leadership, so that the subjective initiative of the masses can be fully exerted, various difficulties can be overcome, and work can continuously move forward. For example, after the first national college entrance examination in 1954, Anhui's results were not good. At that time, many people complained about the poor quality of teachers and the poor foundation of students, and there was a kind of helpless and self-deprecating sentiment of being willing to be downstream. The Provincial Party Committee timely criticized this erroneous view of emphasizing objective difficulties, put forward the slogan of "determined to change the backward situation," and launched a mass education quality inspection in various secondary schools. The local and municipal Party committees also correspondingly made decisions to improve the quality of education, and from top to bottom, they grasped the leadership of school teaching work, laying the foundation for further improving teaching and education quality. During the great development of education in 1956, the right-leaning thought of "more, faster cannot be better and more economical" was also criticized. At the Provincial Party Congress, the call to "accelerate the development of education, actively improve the quality of education, and catch up with the national level within a certain number of years" was put forward. Further emphasis was placed on the training of young teachers, and through various methods such as evaluating advanced examples, selecting and rewarding outstanding teachers, and holding representative meetings of outstanding teachers, the positive factors of teachers were mobilized, and a wave of "learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced" was launched. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the Provincial Party Committee made three resolutions on developing education, strengthening the Party's leadership over schools, and schools running factories and farms, and factories and farms running schools, and successively held several large-scale education work conferences, resolutely and timely implementing the Party's education policy, promoting a great leap forward in education.

   Breaking the "Theory of Qualifications" Emphasizes the Training of New Forces

   The lack of teachers is a relatively big difficulty in our province. First, the original education foundation was poor and the potential was small; second, the normal colleges were established relatively late, and the training was insufficient. In order to adapt to the needs of the rapid development of education, the method of "walking on two legs" was adopted: on the one hand, vigorously developing normal education, and on the other hand, holding various short-term training classes and crash courses in large quantities, while supplementing and replenishing teachers from the lower-level schools while preserving the backbone. Although these methods are transitional, they are necessary to solve the current contradiction between the development of education and the insufficient number of teachers. We put the work of training and improving teachers in the primary position of school work tasks. The method of improvement is also "walking on two legs," one is off-the-job training, and the other is on-the-job training. In the case of insufficient number of teachers, combining work and on-the-job training should be the main method to improve teachers. There are various ways to train on-the-job teachers. What we commonly use is: during the holidays, the province, prefecture, city, and county organize collective lesson preparation or open research conferences; usually, we emphasize the role of teaching and research groups, collective mutual assistance on the basis of self-study, and mobilize old teachers to specifically help new teachers who are unfamiliar with the business, fixed objects, and take apprentices. The method of taking apprentices includes old teachers giving lessons in advance, new teachers listening to lessons first, then teaching lessons while teaching and learning; new and old teachers arrange parallel lessons to facilitate guiding new teachers in lesson preparation; old teachers give large classes (the number of teachers is not enough to teach in separate classes), and other new teachers act as assistants. In short, under the premise of strengthening ideological and political work, through these methods, the professional level of new teachers has improved rapidly, and many graduates of secondary normal schools, primary school teachers, and junior high school teachers three or five years ago have now become the teaching backbone of high schools. Due to the rapid growth of new forces, it has also promoted the continued progress of old teachers.

   Comprehensively Implement the Party's Education Policy and Strengthen the Specific Leadership of School Work We have learned that, on the one hand, we must strengthen political classes and regular ideological and political work; on the other hand, we must seize various political movements to promote the entire school work, emphasizing that the successive comprehensive political movements are an important part of school ideological and political education. Party secretaries at all levels often personally give reports to school teachers and students, and some county Party committees also divide the work to serve as political teachers in secondary schools, which not only strengthens the school's ideological and political education, but also facilitates the close coordination of school education and the Party's central tasks. With the school Party branch as the leading core, the Communist Youth League and class teachers and political teachers are absorbed to form a political teaching and research group, and everyone works together to combine daily ideological work with the teaching of Marxism-Leninism theory, combining collective education with individual education, and the educational effect is great.

   In the leadership of teaching work, we have always emphasized "leading business with politics" and often seize the ideological work of teachers and students.

   In the years of constantly overcoming disasters in Anhui, teachers and students have participated in flood prevention and drought resistance, wasteland reclamation and production, and labor construction of schools. In peacetime, they are also often organized to help farmers rush to harvest and plant, and actively engage in various aspects of social public welfare labor. When work-study began, the Provincial Party Committee timely proposed the principles of focusing on industrial and agricultural production, focusing on collective production, and focusing on production within the school, so that work-study activities could develop healthily, and a climax of schools running factories and farms soon appeared. Following this, all teachers and students were organized to invest in the national movement of large-scale steelmaking and the shock of three autumns. During the large-scale steelmaking movement, we paid attention to seizing the gaps for classes and conducting on-site teaching; after the movement, we immediately seized the resumption of classes and remedial work. In this way, teachers and students were not only given labor training, but also ensured the completion of the teaching plan.

   To improve teaching effectiveness, it is necessary to grasp measures, work meticulously and realistically, and implement them throughout. We believe that it is necessary to grasp the three important links of lesson preparation, classroom teaching, and extracurricular tutoring. We have always emphasized that teachers carry out collective lesson preparation on the basis of self-study, and each teacher ensures that the lesson is prepared several weeks in advance; collective lesson preparation focuses on mastering key content and solving difficult problems. Thanks to the good cooperation between teachers and students, many students have mastered knowledge to the point of "clearing every class, every day, and every week." For some students with poor grades, strengthen extracurricular tutoring to ensure "everyone clears" without being half-baked and can keep up.

   In addition to organizing mass inspections of teaching and education quality every semester, after each college entrance examination, the results of each prefecture, city, and school are notified and analyzed, and the points for improvement are pointed out. Due to the timely summary and provision of the successful experience of good schools, and the summary and provision of the failed experience of poor schools, it is convenient for Party committees at all levels to grasp the school's work situation, further strengthen leadership, and promote learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, mutual competition, and striving for the top among regions and schools. Now everyone firmly believes that: with vigor, there will be a way; with a way, vigor will become greater and greater. People's subjective initiative will forever advance in the continuous development and continuous change of things.

   Although the achievements of our school education and teaching work are continuing to leap forward, they are still far from enough to meet the objective needs of socialist construction. At present, teachers and students at all levels in our province are, under the encouragement of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, further opposing rightism, encouraging vigor, and striving to achieve a continued leap forward in education and teaching work.

　　安徽教育工作是怎样跃进的
　　安徽省教育厅厅长　丁明志
    建国以来，我们在党中央和省委的领导下，在党的过渡时期总路线和社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，随着工农业生产的飞速发展，经过不断努力，基本上改变了安徽教育落后的旧面貌。现在与1949年比，高等学校的学生增加了二十倍，中等学校的学生增加了十一倍，小学教育已经普及，业余教育有了很大发展。至于教学和教育工作成绩，以高中毕业生参加全国高等学校考试的成绩来看，一向落后的安徽，今年已能做到与先进的兄弟省市并肩前进。
    为什么在基础差、条件差的情况下，教学与教育质量也能够跃进呢？我们的体会，主要有以下几点：
    党切实掌握对学校的领导权
    解放思想，大胆提拔使用干部，党切实掌握对学校的领导权。安徽省委自1952年起，即陆续调配党员干部到学校去担任领导工作，使中等以上学校，皆有党员校长或副校长。1958年，根据我省具体情况对调到学校去的干部的政治和文化条件，做了相应的明确规定，坚持了“先派进去，再培养提高”的方针；强调各级党委动手，进行全面安排，一举配齐了大、中学校和大部分小学的党员校长，大部分中等学校和大专学校各系科皆先后建立起党的领导核心。仅1958年5月到10月，全省调配到各级学校的党员干部即达一万多人，因而解决了从组织上保证党对学校工作领导的根本性问题。
    对于新派进学校的党员干部，我们从多方面给以培养提高。除了在政治上、思想上经常给以鼓励外，还通过交流经验、参观访问及短期训练等办法，不断提高他们的业务水平。由于党的关怀培养和他们在工作实践中的刻苦钻研，他们也就逐渐熟悉了学校业务。
    我们还及时扭转了某些教育行政部门和学校只重业务，不重政治的观点。在这一基础上，大胆地提拔了政治好、思想进步又肯钻业务的教师，担任教研组长、班主任等职务。经验告诉我们，加强党对学校工作的领导，是迅速提高教学质量，办好学校的根本保证；而组织建设又是实现党的领导的根本措施。
    政治挂帅树立争上游的决心
    教育事业是群众性的事业。充分调动人民群众和广大师生的积极性，是办好教育事业的重要条件。因此，我们必须坚持政治挂帅，思想工作先行，积极发动群众，不断地反右倾、鼓干劲，树立克服困难、力争上游的决心。在我们安徽长期的、突出的右倾思想障碍是“唯条件论”。因而党在思想领导上同“唯条件论”进行了反复的斗争，使群众的主观能动作用得以充分发挥，使种种困难得以克服，使工作不断前进。如在1954年全国第一次高考后，安徽成绩不好，当时不少人埋怨教师质量差、学生基础差，浮动着一种无可奈何、甘居下游的自卑情绪。省委及时批判了这种强调客观困难的错误观点，提出“决心改变落后面貌”的口号，发动各中等学校进行了群众性的教育质量大检查。各地、市委又相应地作出提高教育质量的决定，从上到下抓紧了学校教学工作的领导，为进一步提高教学和教育质量打下了基础。1956年教育事业大发展时期，又批判了当时存在的“多快不能好省”的右倾思想。在省党代表大会上提出了“加速教育事业的发展，积极提高教育质量，在一定年限内赶上国家水平”的号召。进一步又强调了对青年教师的培养，并通过评比先进事例、评选和奖励优秀教师、召开优秀教师代表会等多种办法，调动了教师的积极因素，掀起了“学先进、赶先进”的热潮。1958年大跃进，省委作出发展教育事业、加强党对学校领导和学校办工厂农场、工厂农场办学校等三项决议，连续召开了几次规模较大的教育工作会议，坚决地及时地贯彻执行了党的教育方针，促使教育工作大跃进。
    打破“资格论”重视新生力量的培养
    师资缺乏，是我省一个比较大的困难。一来原有教育基础差、潜力小；二来师范学院建立较迟，培养不及。为了适应教育事业飞速发展的需要，便采用了“两条腿走路”的办法：一方面大力发展师范教育，另一方面大量举办各种短训班、速成班，同时在保存骨干的原则下，在下一级学校教师中提升补充。这些办法虽然是过渡性的，但在解决当前教育事业发展与师资数量不足的矛盾问题，都是必需的。培养提高教师的工作，我们提到学校工作任务的首要地位。提高的办法也是“两条腿走路”，一是离职轮训， 一是在职培养。在师资数量不充裕的情况下，结合工作在职培养，应该是提高教师的主要办法。培养在职师资的办法是多种多样的，我们普遍采用的：假期由省、专、市、县分别组织集体备课或开研究会；平时强调教研组作用，在自我钻研的基础上集体互助，并发动老教师具体帮助业务生疏的新教师，固定对象，带徒弟。带徒弟的办法有老教师提前上课，新教师先听课、后教课边教边学；有新老教师排平行课，便于在备课中指导新教师；有老教师上大课（教师数量不够不能分班上课），其他新教师当助手。总之，在加强思想政治工作的前提下，通过这些办法，新师资的业务水平提高很快，许多三、五年前的中师毕业生、小学教师、初中教师，现在已成为高中的教学骨干。由于新生力量的迅速成长，也促进了老教师的继续前进。
    全面贯彻党的教育工作方针，加强学校工作的具体领导我们体会，一方面，加强政治课和经常的思想政治工作；一方面抓紧各项政治运动推动整个学校工作，强调把历次全面性政治运动作为学校思想政治教育的重要内容。各级党委书记，经常亲自给学校师生作报告，有些县委还分工担任中等学校的政治教员，不但使学校的思想政治教育加强，而且便于使学校教育和党的中心任务紧密配合。以学校党支部为领导核心，吸收共青团及班主任、政治教师组成政治教研组，大家齐动手，使日常思想工作和马列主义理论教学结合，集体教育和个别教育结合，教育效果很大。
    在教学工作的领导上，我们一向强调“以政治领导业务”，经常抓紧做好师生的思想工作。
    安徽在不断战胜灾荒的岁月里，防汛抗旱，开荒生产，劳动建校，教师和学生都是参加的。在平时，也经常组织他们帮助农民抢收抢种，并积极从事多方面的社会公益劳动。勤工俭学开始，省委及时提出工农业生产为主、集体生产为主、校内生产为主的原则，使勤工俭学活动得以健康发展，很快出现了学校大办工厂、农场的高潮。继之，组织全体师生投入大办钢铁和突击三秋的全民运动等。大办钢铁运动中，我们就注意抓紧空隙上课，进行现场教学；运动结束后，即抓紧了复课补课工作。这样，既使师生受到劳动锻炼，又保证了教学计划的完成。
    要提高教学效果，一定还要抓措施，细致踏实地工作，并贯彻始终。我们认为抓紧备课、课堂教学、课外辅导三个重要环节是很必要的。我们一直强调教师在自我钻研的基础上进行集体备课，每个教师保证提前数周把课备好；集体备课着重掌握重点内容，解决困难问题。由于师生协作得好，许多学生掌握知识已做到“堂堂清、天天清、周周清。”对于某些成绩较差的学生，加强课外辅导，以保证“人人清”，没有夹生，能够跟上去。
    我们除了每学期组织群众性的教学和教育质量的检查以外，每年高考以后，各专、市、各学校的成绩都加以通报，并进行分析，指出改进要点。由于及时总结和提供了好的学校的成功经验，也总结和提供了差的学校的失败经验，便于各级党委掌握学校工作情况，进一步加强领导，并推动了地区之间、学校之间，学先进、赶先进，互相比赛，力争上游。现在大家深信：有干劲，才会出办法；有了办法，干劲就越来越大。人们的主观能动作用，就在事物的不断发展不断变化中，永远前进。
    我们的学校教育和教学工作成绩，虽然是继续跃进的，但从适应社会主义建设客观需要看来，还是很不够的。目前我省各级学校师生，正在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，进一步反右倾、鼓干劲，为争取实现教育和教学工作的继续跃进而奋斗。
