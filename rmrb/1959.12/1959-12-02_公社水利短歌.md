Public Commune Water Conservancy Short Songs
Qu Gang

    Harnessing Water, Managing Soil, and Governing Mountains
    Legend has it that Yu the Great dredged the nine rivers,
    Qin Shi Huang cracked his whip and drove the mountains.
    The commune members are brave as tigers,
    Harnessing water, managing soil, and governing mountains.

    Red Maiden and Woodcutter Become Lovers
    Red Maiden River, Woodcutter Mountain,
    The sky canal connects you with a red thread.
    Red Maiden hears and jumps into the sedan,
    Singing songs all the way up the mountain.

    Reservoir Like a Concert Hall
    The reservoir is like a concert hall,
    The hundred-mile-long dam is like a stringed instrument.
    Newly built sluice gates are like piano keys,
    The flowing water plays songs, sound after sound.

    公社水利短歌
    瞿钢治水治土又治山传说大禹疏九河，始皇挥鞭赶大山，公社社员长虎胆，治水治土又治山。红女樵哥结成亲红女河，樵哥山，天渠为你牵红线，红女一听跳上轿，一路歌儿唱上山。水库像个音乐厅水库像个音乐厅，百里长堤像琴弦，新修水闸如琴键，流水弹唱歌声声。
