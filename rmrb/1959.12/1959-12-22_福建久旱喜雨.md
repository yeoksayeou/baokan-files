Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 20th: Recent continuous rains in various parts of Fujian Province have been very beneficial for the growth of various overwintering crops. From the 14th to the 16th, the rainfall in the northwest of the province, including Shaowu, Chong'an, Pucheng, Longyan, Shanghang, and Zhangping counties, as well as in the south in Hua'an and Yongchun counties, reached 34 to 49 millimeters. Areas that had been experiencing prolonged drought, such as the Minhou, Jinjiang, and Longxi regions and Xiamen City, also received widespread rainfall of 10 to more than 20 millimeters, easing the drought situation somewhat or basically resolving it.

Since mid-to-late September, only a small amount of rain had fallen in individual mountainous areas of Fujian Province. Coastal areas such as Minhou, Jinjiang, Longxi regions, and Xiamen City had experienced drought for as long as three months. According to incomplete statistics, more than 900,000 mu of crops were affected by the drought in these areas. Thanks to the close reliance on the masses by Party committees at all levels, the full utilization of the superiority of the people's communes, and resolute struggles against the drought, the vast majority of drought-stricken crops are growing normally.

After the widespread welcome rain, various localities seized this favorable opportunity to mobilize the broad masses of commune members to launch a concentrated effort to apply fertilizer, eliminate pests, and strengthen field management; repair canals and prepare for water diversion, storage, and irrigation. They also made a concentrated effort to replant, interplant, or expand planting on withered seedlings and on some land that had not yet been sown. In addition, various localities are taking advantage of the moist soil after the rain to accelerate deep plowing of the land in preparation for next year's production.

　　福建久旱喜雨
    新华社福州20日电　福建各地近日来连降喜雨，对各种越冬作物生长十分有利。14日至16日，西北部的邵武、崇安、浦城、龙岩、上杭、漳平，以及南部的华安、永春等县降雨量达三十四至四十九毫米；闽侯、晋江、龙溪专区和厦门市等久旱不雨的地区，也普遍降雨十毫米至二十多毫米，使旱象稍为缓和或基本解决。
    福建省自9月中、下旬以来，只有个别山区下过少量雨。闽侯、晋江、龙溪专区和厦门市等沿海地区，干旱达三个月之久。据不完全统计，这些地区受旱作物达九十万多亩。由于各级党委紧紧依靠群众，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，坚决和干旱斗争，使绝大部分受旱的农作物生长正常。
    普降喜雨以后，各地又抓住这一有利时机，发动广大社员突击施肥、除虫，加强田间管理；整修渠道，作好引水蓄水灌溉工作。对枯死苗以及部分尚未下种的土地，也突击补种、套种或扩种。此外，各地还利用雨后土地湿润的时机加速深翻土地，为明年生产作准备。
