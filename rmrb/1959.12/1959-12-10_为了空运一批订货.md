    To Airlift a Batch of Orders
    One afternoon, I took the delivery note to the supply and marketing department of the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant and asked them to transport our factory's urgently needed motor orders to the airport that afternoon. However, all the factory's trucks were out delivering goods, and the factory comrades were about to get off work. What could be done? Suddenly, I thought of calling the business department of the Wuhan Station of the Civil Aviation Administration to see if they could send a truck to help. Sure enough, as soon as they heard that it was an urgent order for the factory, they immediately agreed. In less than half an hour, the salesperson who answered the phone came with the truck. When we arrived at the warehouse to pick up the goods, the warehouse staff had left work. Although the warehouse负责人 (person in charge) agreed to issue the goods to us, the warehouse workers had left, and there was no one to load the truck. At this time, the comrade from the airport enthusiastically said, "Come on, let's load it ourselves!" At his suggestion, we (including the truck driver and the warehouse负责同志 (responsible comrade)) started working together.
    To support our factory, everyone didn't bother to eat dinner, worked on an empty stomach, and were covered in sweat. One box, two boxes, five boxes... until all forty-four motors were loaded onto the truck. When we arrived at the airport, the comrades from the business department didn't bother to eat or rest, and completed the air transport procedures for us, so that the batch of goods caught the flight to Kunming. Later, I learned that the name of the salesperson was Li Maoran.

    为了空运一批订货
    有一天下午，我带着提货单赶到武汉重型机床厂供销科去，请他们把我厂等着急用的电机订货在当天下午运到航空站去。可是工厂的汽车都出去运货去了，工厂同志又马上要下班，怎么办呢？忽然我想起给民航局武汉站营业部打电话试试，看他们能不能派汽车支援一下。果然，他们一听要运工厂急用的订货，马上就答应了。不到半小时，接电话的那位营业员就随汽车一道来了。当我们到提货的仓库的时候，仓库职工下班了，虽然仓库负责人同意给我们发货，但是仓库的工人走了，没人给装车。这时航空站的同志热情地说：“来，我们自己装吧！”在他的提议下，我们（包括汽车司机、仓库负责同志）就一起动手干起来了。
    为了支援我们工厂，大家都顾不得吃晚饭，饿着肚子，累得满头大汗。一箱、两箱、五箱……直到把四十四台电机都装上了车。到了航空站，营业部的同志顾不上吃饭休息，又为我们办了空运手续，使这批货赶上了到昆明去的班机。后来，我才知道那位营业员的名字叫李茂然。
