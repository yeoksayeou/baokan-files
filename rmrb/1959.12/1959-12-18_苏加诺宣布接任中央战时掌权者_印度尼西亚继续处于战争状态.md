Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 16th: Indonesian President Sukarno announced to the nation on the radio tonight that Indonesia remains in a state of war; and that he himself, in his capacity as head of state, will personally assume power as the Central Wartime Authority.

Sukarno announced in his broadcast the implementation of Government Regulation No. 23 of 1959 regarding the continuation of the state of emergency. This new government regulation, which replaces the 1957 state of emergency decree that expires tonight, will take effect tonight.

The new regulation stipulates that a state of emergency is divided into three stages: civil state of emergency, military state of emergency, and war state of emergency, with the war state of emergency being the most severe stage.

In explaining the reasons for extending the state of emergency, Sukarno said that Indonesia has not yet escaped the signs that threaten its survival. Although the basic forces of the rebels and the Islamic army have been defeated, work is still needed to consolidate and stabilize those areas. There are also chaotic situations in the economy, and subversive activities at home and abroad.

According to the new government regulation, Indonesia has only one Central Wartime Authority, which is the President, who also serves as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The wartime authorities in various regions must obey his orders and instructions and be responsible to him. When Sukarno exercises his powers as the Central Wartime Authority, he will be assisted by an agency composed of the First Minister, the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Interior, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Chiefs of Staff of the three services, and the Chief of the National Police.

    苏加诺宣布接任中央战时掌权者
    印度尼西亚继续处于战争状态
    据新华社雅加达16日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺今天晚上在电台向全国人民宣布，印度尼西亚仍然处于战争状态；而他自己以国家元首身份亲自接任中央战时掌权者。
    苏加诺在广播中宣布了继续执行紧急状态法令的1959年政府第二十三号条例。这项代替于今晚期满的1957年紧急状态法令的新的政府条例从今天晚上开始生效。
    这项新条例规定，紧急状态分三个阶段：民政紧急状态、军事紧急状态和战争紧急状态。其中以战争紧急状态为最严重的阶段。
    在解释延长紧急状态的原因时，苏加诺说，目前印度尼西亚仍然没有摆脱威胁着它的生存的征兆。虽然叛乱分子和伊斯兰教军的基本力量已经被打垮，但是仍需进行使那些地区巩固和稳定的工作。在经济方面还有紊乱的情况，国内外还有颠覆活动。
    根据新的政府条例，印度尼西亚只有一个中央战时掌权者，那就是兼任武装部队最高司令的总统。各地的战时掌权者必须服从他的命令和指示，对他负责。在苏加诺以中央战时掌权者身份执行他的权力时，将由一个由第一部长、国防部长、内政部长、外交部长、三军参谋长和国家警察总长组成的机构协助他工作。
