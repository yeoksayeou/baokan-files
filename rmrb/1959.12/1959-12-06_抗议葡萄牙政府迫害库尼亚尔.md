    Protest Against the Portuguese Government's Persecution of Cunhal
    Commentator of this newspaper
    Recently, the Salazar dictatorial government of Portugal has been intensifying its persecution of patriotic people. In particular, the Portuguese Communist Party has become the main target of the reactionary government's persecution. Many patriots have been subjected to severe torture, many communists have been imprisoned, and some have been brutally murdered. Álvaro Cunhal, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, who has been imprisoned for ten years, has also been subjected to cruel persecution in prison. This revolutionary leader, deeply loved by the masses, was arrested in 1949 and initially sentenced to four years in prison by the fascist court. Later, the fascist government increased the sentence by two years under a pretext, plus a so-called "preventive detention" of one year. Cunhal was supposed to be released after serving his term in 1956, but the dictatorial government, based on the fascist law of so-called "security measures," has twice consecutively increased his sentence by four years. The new sentence will expire in January next year, but the Salazar government still does not intend to restore his freedom.
    Álvaro Cunhal is an outstanding fighter who has actively struggled for the cause of peace and justice. He has long been engaged in the workers' movement and has united people from all walks of life in Portugal to fight unyieldingly against the fascist regime. Precisely because of this, the Salazar government regards Cunhal as a thorn in its side and has repeatedly persecuted him, attempting to break his will to fight. However, as a loyal son of the Portuguese people and the Communist Party, Cunhal solemnly condemned the conspiracies of the dictatorial rulers in court, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the working class. The fascist court could not prove Cunhal's "crimes," but instead exposed the fascist face of the Salazar ruling clique more clearly.
    During the thirty years of the dictatorial regime's rule in Portugal, fascist shadows have loomed over the country, secret agents and police have roamed everywhere, and the army of unemployed has grown year by year. In particular, the treasonous policy implemented by the Salazar government has reduced Portugal to a vassal of U.S. imperialism, bringing serious disasters and threats to the Portuguese people. The Portuguese people are unwilling to endure this humiliation and powerlessness any longer. They are further strengthening their unity and actively carrying out the struggle against the Salazar dictatorship and for democratic freedom. The Portuguese government's barbaric persecution of Cunhal and other patriots is increasingly arousing the indignation and opposition of the Portuguese people. A nationwide movement demanding the release of political prisoners is unfolding widely, and calls for the release of Álvaro Cunhal have spread throughout the country. Although the Salazar government is desperately persecuting the people in a desperate attempt to save its crumbling dictatorial rule, the democratic forces of the Portuguese people will one day defeat Salazar's fascist rule.
    The Portuguese people's struggle against the dictatorial regime has won the widespread sympathy and concern of the world's people of justice. We, the Chinese people, express our firm support for the Portuguese people's movement demanding the release of political prisoners. In order to uphold justice and safeguard human rights, we protest against the Salazar government's persecution of Álvaro Cunhal. We appeal to fair-minded public opinion around the world: Cunhal must be released, and all Portuguese patriots must be released!

    抗议葡萄牙政府迫害库尼亚尔
    本报评论员
    最近一个时期，葡萄牙的萨拉查独裁政府正在加紧对爱国人民的迫害。特别是葡萄牙共产党，成为反动政府迫害的主要目标。不少爱国志士遭到严刑拷打，许多共产党员身陷囹圄，有的被野蛮杀害。已被监禁达十年之久的葡萄牙共产党中央委员会书记阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔也在狱中遭到残酷的迫害。这位深受群众爱戴的革命领袖是在1949年被捕的，最初被法西斯法庭判处了四年徒刑，后来法西斯政府借故增加了两年徒刑，外加所谓“预防拘禁”一年。库尼亚尔本应在1956年服刑期满出狱，但是独裁政府竟根据所谓“安全措施”的法西斯法律，又连续两次增加了他四年徒刑。新的刑期将在明年1月届满，但是萨拉查政府仍不打算让他恢复自由。
    阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔是一位为和平和正义事业而积极斗争的杰出战士。他长期以来从事工人运动，并团结葡萄牙各阶层人民，不屈不挠地同法西斯政权进行斗争。正因为这样，萨拉查政府视库尼亚尔为眼中钉，一再对他进行迫害，企图折磨他的斗争意志。但是，作为葡萄牙人民和共产党的忠实的儿子，库尼亚尔在法庭上严正地谴责了独裁统治者的阴谋，表现了工人阶级坚贞不屈的英雄气概。法西斯法庭并不能证明库尼亚尔的“罪状”，反而更清楚地暴露了萨拉查统治集团的法西斯面目。
    在独裁政权统治葡萄牙的三十年间，法西斯阴影笼罩全国，特务和警察到处横行，失业大军与年俱增。特别是萨拉查政府执行的卖国政策，使葡萄牙沦为美帝国主义的附庸，给葡萄牙人民带来了严重的灾难和威胁。葡萄牙人民不愿意再忍受这种屈辱和无权的生活，他们正在进一步加强团结，积极进行反抗萨拉查独裁统治和争取民主自由的斗争。葡萄牙政府对库尼亚尔和其他爱国者的野蛮迫害，越来越激起葡萄牙人民的愤慨和反对。一个席卷全国的要求释放政治犯的运动正在广泛展开，要求释放阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔的呼声遍及各地。尽管萨拉查政府为了挽救其摇摇欲坠的独裁统治，不惜孤注一掷地对人民进行疯狂的迫害。但是，葡萄牙人民的民主力量总有一天会战胜萨拉查的法西斯统治。
    葡萄牙人民反抗独裁政权的斗争，得到全世界正义人民的广泛同情和关怀。我们中国人民，对葡萄牙人民要求释放政治犯运动表示坚决支持。为了伸张正义和保障人权，我们抗议萨拉查政府对阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔的迫害行为。我们向全世界公正舆论发出呼吁：必须释放库尼亚尔，必须释放葡萄牙的一切爱国者！
