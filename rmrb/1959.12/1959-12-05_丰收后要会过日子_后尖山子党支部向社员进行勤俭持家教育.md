Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 4th: The Houjianshanzi Production Team Party Branch of the Dayushubao Commune in Yixian County, Liaoning Province, promptly educated its members on thrifty housekeeping after the harvest, mobilizing them to make plans for a good life.

The Houjianshanzi Production Team reaped a bumper harvest in agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations this year, with each member household's income increasing compared to last year. The members' enthusiasm for production is even higher. However, some members lacked planning in their lives and lacked the spirit of continuous saving and thrifty housekeeping. After discovering this problem, the Party Branch believed that if the members were not promptly educated on thrifty housekeeping, some members' lives might become difficult by the time of the spring grain shortage, affecting next year's major production. However, some cadres said, "After working hard for a year, it's only right to eat and spend a little." "Who doesn't know how to live? There's no time to manage these trivial matters." In order to solve this problem promptly, the Party Branch first inspired Party members, Youth League members, and cadres to recall the lessons of the post-distribution period in 1957. 1957 was also a bumper year, but before the autumn harvest of 1958, some members still borrowed money from credit cooperatives. The reason was that some cadres at the time only focused on production and did not pay enough attention to the members' lives. After airing views and debates, everyone unanimously realized that they must learn from the lessons of 1957 and promptly educate the members on thrifty housekeeping.

The Production Team Party Branch first calculated four accounts for the members through airing views and debates: First, calculate the account of diligence and thrift, explaining that diligent production and saving expenses are the only way to live a good life; criticize the practice of being diligent but not thrifty, using up rice in one pot, firewood in one stove, and spending money recklessly, and establish the idea of diligence, thrift, and preparedness. Second, calculate the account of planned grain use and economical grain use, educating members to save at the beginning of storage and not to save only when the storage is almost empty. Third, calculate the account of doing a good job in winter production to ensure another bumper harvest next year; Fourth, calculate the account of doing a good job in winter household sideline production to increase income and support national construction. At the same time, two typical households were selected to educate the masses with facts. One household planned their lives well, and although their income was not high, they still had savings; the other household was only diligent but not thrifty, and although their income was not small, they had no food, no fuel, and no money to spend during the spring grain shortage. This sharp contrast made everyone further realize the benefits of thrifty housekeeping.

On the basis of improving the ideological understanding of the masses, the Party Branch then mobilized every household to make a living plan. Most of the 130 households in the team held family meetings and formulated expenditure plans based on their family income. According to the plan, in addition to necessary expenses, the members of the team had a total surplus of more than 41,000 yuan, all of which was deposited in the credit cooperative. In terms of household sideline production, each household also formulated a plan. According to this plan, the average income of sideline production for each household this winter and next spring can be more than 70 yuan. (Attached picture)

### 丰收后要会过日子  后尖山子党支部向社员进行勤俭持家教育

    丰收后要会过日子
    后尖山子党支部向社员进行勤俭持家教育
    据新华社沈阳4日电　辽宁省义县大榆树堡公社后尖山子生产队党支部，在丰收后及时向社员进行勤俭持家教育，发动社员订计划过好日子。
    后尖山子生产队今年农牧副业都获得了丰收，每户社员秋后收入都比去年增加。社员们的生产积极性更加高涨。但是有一部分社员过日子没有计划，缺乏细水长流、勤俭持家的精神。党支部发现这个问题以后，认为如果不及时对社员进行勤俭持家教育，这样下去，到明春青黄不接的时候，可能有些社员生活会发生困难，影响明年大生产。可是有些干部却说：“忙了一年，吃点花点是应分的。”“谁还不会过日子，哪有工夫管这些闲事。”为了及时解决这个问题，党支部首先启发党、团员和干部回忆了1957年分配后的教训。1957年也是个丰收年，可是到1958年秋收前，有的社员还向信贷社借钱。原因是当时有的干部只顾抓生产，对社员生活注意不够。经过鸣放辩论，大家一致认识到必须接受1957年的教训，及时向社员进行勤俭持家教育。
    生产队党支部首先通过鸣放辩论的方法，向社员算了四笔账：一算勤和俭的账，讲清勤劳生产、节约开支是过好日子的唯一出路；批判只勤不俭，有米一锅，有柴一灶，有钱乱花的作法，树立勤俭节约、有备无患的思想。二算计划用粮节约用粮账，教育社员囤尖省，别到囤底再省。三算搞好冬季生产保证明年再丰收账；四算搞好冬季家庭副业生产，增加收入支援国家建设账。同时，又选择了两个典型户，用事实教育群众。一户过日子有计划，虽然收入不多但还有存款；另一户只勤不俭，虽然收入不少，可是到青黄不接的时候没吃、没烧、没钱花。这个鲜明的对比，使大家更进一步认识到勤俭持家的好处。
    在群众思想认识提高的基础上，党支部又发动家家户户订过日子计划。全队一百三十户人家，绝大部分开了家庭会议，根据家庭收入情况订出了开支计划。根据计划，全队社员除去必要的开支以外，一共余下四万一千多元，全部存入了信贷社。在家庭副业生产方面每户也都订出了计划。根据这个计划，每户今冬明春副业生产平均可收入七十多元。（附图片）
