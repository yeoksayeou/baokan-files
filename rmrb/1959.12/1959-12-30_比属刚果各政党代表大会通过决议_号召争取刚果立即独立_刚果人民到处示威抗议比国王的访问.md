　　Xinhua News Agency, December 28th, Leopoldville dispatch: A three-day congress of political parties in the Belgian Congo concluded on the evening of the 27th with the passage of resolutions calling for the immediate independence of the Congo and setting February 5th as the date for negotiations with the Belgian government on the transfer of power.
    The resolution passed by this congress, convened at the suggestion of the ABAKO Party, the Kalonji faction of the Congolese National Movement, and the African Solidarity Party, declared that the election campaign would begin immediately, and the Congolese government formed after the election would immediately take over power. Before this Congolese government is established, the congress refuses to discuss any principles concerning the future relationship between Belgium and the Congo.
    Regarding the national structure of the Congo, the congress believes that the Congo's current six provinces can become six republics and unite to form the "Union of Central African Republics." The union will have legislative, executive, and judicial powers.
    This congress was held in Kizanitu, about fifty miles south of Leopoldville.
    During the congress, ABAKO party members wearing yellow armbands guarded the venue. In addition to the three parties that convened the meeting, the People's Party and the BAYANZI Alliance also participated.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 29th, Leopoldville dispatch: Belgian King Baudouin, who is currently "inspecting" various parts of the Belgian Congo, is encountering demonstrations by Africans everywhere demanding immediate independence.
    On the 28th, when he arrived in the Congolese capital, Leopoldville, along the route from the airport to the colonial governor's residence, many Africans, disregarding the strict precautions of the colonial military police, shouted slogans of "Immediate Independence" as Baudouin passed by. Some demonstrators also demanded the release of Patrice Lumumba, chairman of the Congolese National Movement, who is still imprisoned in Stanleyville prison.
    Despite the Belgian colonial authorities' extensive threats and deceptions beforehand, those who went to the airport to greet Baudouin that day were only some colonial military police, colonial officials, and some white "immigrants." Western news agencies admitted that this formed a sharp contrast to the grand scene of people warmly welcoming ABAKO Party Chairman Kasavubu when he returned from Brussels two weeks ago.
    Prior to this, on the 23rd, when Baudouin arrived in Elizabethville, Africans there also held placards with the slogan "Long Live Immediate Independence."
    Earlier, Baudouin also encountered similar people's demonstrations in Stanleyville.

　　比属刚果各政党代表大会通过决议
    号召争取刚果立即独立
    刚果人民到处示威抗议比国王的访问
    新华社28日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比属刚果各政党举行的历时三天的代表大会在27日晚上闭幕时通过决议，号召争取刚果立即独立，并且把2月5日定为同比利时政府就移交政权举行谈判的日期。
    由阿巴科党、刚果民族运动党卡隆吉派和非洲团结党建议召开的这个代表大会所通过的决议宣布，选举运动从现在就开始，选举后产生的刚果政府将立即接管政权。在这个刚果政府建立以前，代表大会拒绝讨论有关比利时和刚果的未来关系的任何原则。
    关于刚果的国家结构，代表大会认为，刚果目前的六省可以成为六个共和国而联合成为“中非共和国联盟”。联盟将拥有立法权、行政权和司法权。
    这次代表大会是在利奥波德维尔以南约五十英里的基赞图举行的。
    大会举行时，有戴着黄色臂章的阿巴科党员在会场周围警戒着。参加大会的除了三个召集会议的政党外还有人民党和巴阳齐联盟。
    新华社29日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：正在比属刚果各地“巡视”的比利时国王博杜安，到处遇到非洲人要求立即独立的示威。
    28日，当他到达刚果首府利奥波德维尔时，从机场到殖民总督府的沿途，许多非洲人不顾殖民军警的戒备森严，在博杜安经过时高呼“立即独立”的口号。一些示威者还要求释放现仍监禁在斯坦利维尔监狱中的刚果民族运动党主席卢蒙巴。
    尽管比利时殖民当局事前大肆威胁诱骗，但是当天到机场去迎接博杜安的，只是一些殖民军警、殖民官员和一些白种“移民”。西方通讯社承认，这同两星期前阿巴科党主席卡萨武布从布鲁塞尔回去时人民去热烈欢迎的盛况形成了尖锐的对照。
    在这以前，23日，当博杜安到达伊利莎伯维尔时，那里的非洲人也举着“立即独立万岁”的标语牌。
    再早些时候，博杜安在斯坦利维尔也遇到了同样的人民示威。
