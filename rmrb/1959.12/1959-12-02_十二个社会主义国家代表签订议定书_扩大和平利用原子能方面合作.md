Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 30th. Plenipotentiary representatives from the member countries of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research held a meeting in Dubna, near Moscow, from the 26th to the 28th. Representatives from twelve socialist countries participated in the meeting. At the closing session on the 28th, a protocol was signed to further expand cooperation among member countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and supplementary articles of association for the institute were adopted.

The Director of the Institute, Blokhintsev, delivered a report at the meeting on the work of the Institute in 1959. In analyzing the most important research work completed by the Institute in atomic physics this year, he pointed out that the scientific activities of the Institute have been greatly expanded as a result of work carried out at the High Energy Laboratory using the synchrophasotron. A series of works completed in this laboratory clarified some unclear aspects of nucleon structure and elucidated the laws governing the production of some "strange particles," thus creating conditions for naming these particles with new characteristics.

Blokhintsev said that one of the newly established laboratories—the Neutron Physics Laboratory—has formulated a meaningful experimental plan to verify the general theory of relativity. This will be the first time such an experiment has been conducted on Earth. Until now, such experiments were considered possible only in outer space.

In his report, Blokhintsev also mentioned the successful experiments in meson physics conducted by the Nuclear Problems Laboratory in 1959.

According to the supplementary articles of association passed at the committee, the authority of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research has been increased. In the future, the Institute can convene advisory meetings at the request of any member country to discuss research plans for the peaceful use of atomic energy, and can convene meetings to exchange experiences as needed. In addition, the supplementary articles stipulate that countries can mutually dispatch experts in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

At the committee, the Administrative Director of the Institute, Serdyuchenko, delivered a report on the 1960 budget, capital construction, and staffing plan. He said that next year the number of scientists and engineers from various countries in Dubna will double.

    十二个社会主义国家代表签订议定书
    扩大和平利用原子能方面合作
    新华社莫斯科30日电　联合原子核研究所成员国全权代表委员会26日到28日在莫斯科近郊的杜布纳举行会议。十二个社会主义国家的代表参加了会议。在28日闭幕会上，签订了进一步扩大各成员国在和平利用原子能方面的合作的议定书，通过了研究所补充章程。
    研究所所长勃洛欣采夫在会上作了1959年度研究所工作的报告。他在分析研究所今年完成的原子物理方面的最重要的研究工作时指出，由于在高能量试验室中利用同步稳相加速器开展工作的结果，研究所的科学活动大大地扩大了。在这个试验室中完成的一系列的工作阐明了核子结构方面的某些没有弄清楚的问题，阐明了一些“奇异粒子”的产生的规律，这样，就有条件给这些具有新特性的粒子命名。
    勃洛欣采夫说，新建立的实验室之一——中子物理实验室拟定了验证广义相对论的有意义的试验计划。这将是头一次在地球上进行这种试验。到目前为止，这种试验被认为只能在宇宙空间范围内进行。
    勃洛欣采夫在报告中还谈到了核问题实验室1959年进行的介子物理方面的成功的试验。
    根据委员会上通过的补充章程规定，联合原子核研究所的权限增大了，今后研究所可以根据任何成员国的请求召集咨询会议，讨论和平利用原子能方面的研究计划，可以根据需要召开交流经验的会议，另外，补充章程规定，各国可以互派和平利用原子能方面的专家。
    在委员会上，研究所行政所长谢尔坚科作了关于1960年预算、基本建设和工作人员名额计划的报告。他说，明年在杜布纳的来自各国的科学家和工程师将增加一倍。
