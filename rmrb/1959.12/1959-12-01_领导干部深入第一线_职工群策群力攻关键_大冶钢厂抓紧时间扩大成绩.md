Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 29th: The Daye Steel Plant is firmly seizing the last month or so of this year, mobilizing workers to overcome weak links, and ensuring the comprehensive early overfulfillment of this year's state plan.

On the 25th, the plant launched its fifth campaign to break through key production problems, strengthen equipment maintenance and repair, improve operating rates, and strengthen desulfurization work. The plant headquarters established a command post for tackling key problems, and workshops established tackling groups; the plant director, the Party committee secretary, and workshop leaders went deep into the production front lines, working shifts day and night alongside workers to solve key production problems. Technical performance competitions and rivalry matches were widely and deeply carried out in each workshop, and new production records emerged continuously. The No. 5 electric furnace, whose production had always been relatively backward, improved its operating methods in the rivalry match, adopting quick slag skimming and furnace patching, quick melting, quick charging, and high-temperature boiling and high-temperature refining operations, breaking through the key problem of long melting times. In the last ten days of the month it continuously created new records four times, catching up with their rivals. The open hearth furnace strengthened maintenance work, improved the operating rate, and in the first six days of the last ten days of the month, the daily output was 126 tons of steel more than the daily output in the middle ten days of the month.

    领导干部深入第一线　职工群策群力攻关键
    大冶钢厂抓紧时间扩大成绩
    据新华社武汉29日电　大冶钢厂狠狠抓紧今年最后一个多月的时间，发动职工克服薄弱环节，保证全面提前超额完成今年国家计划。
    25日，这个厂开展了第五次攻破生产关键的运动，加强设备维护修理，提高作业率，加强脱硫工作。厂部成立了攻关指挥部，车间成立了攻关小组；厂长、党委书记和车间领导干部都深入生产第一线，日夜轮流跟班劳动，同职工一起解决生产关键问题。各车间广泛深入地开展技术表演赛和对手赛，生产新纪录不断涌现。生产一向比较落后的五号电炉，在对手赛中改进操作方法，采取快扒渣补炉、快熔化、快装料和高温沸腾、高温精炼的操作方法，攻破了熔化期长的关键，下旬连续四次创造新纪录，赶过了他们的对手。平炉加强维护工作，提高了作业率，下旬前六天每天比中旬日产量多产一百二十六吨钢。
