(Xinhua News Agency, December 9th) According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly began discussing the so-called "Hungarian question" on the 8th, which was included on the agenda under pressure from the United States and other Western delegations.

    The United Nations Special Representative on the "Hungarian Question," Munro (New Zealand), presented a report on the "question" to the General Assembly. U.S. Representative Lodge then spoke, launching vicious attacks on the Hungarian People's Republic and the Soviet Union.

    The representatives of Hungary, the Soviet Union, and Albania exposed the slanders in Munro's report and pointed out that raising the so-called "Hungarian question" itself proves that proponents of the "Cold War" are once again attempting to obstruct the relaxation of the international situation.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, said that the Soviet delegation has repeatedly pointed out that including the so-called "Hungarian question" on the agenda is a brazen violation of the United Nations Charter, which prohibits interference in the internal affairs of other countries. It is regrettable that, due to the abuse of power by some national delegations, the United Nations General Assembly has been dragged into discussions that endanger the cause of peace and damage the prestige of the United Nations.

    Kuznetsov pointed out that some people in Western countries, including some who have influence on foreign policy, are unwilling to see the international climate improve and still adhere to a "position of strength" policy. Some people in the United States have been trying to carry out subversive activities against countries that are unwilling to follow the United States. The so-called "Hungarian question" should be considered from this perspective. If this issue is to be discussed, the main focus should be on the interference by Western countries in the internal affairs of other countries.

    Kuznetsov emphasized that socialist countries do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and they have the right to demand that other countries not interfere in the internal affairs of socialist countries.

    Kuznetsov concluded that the sooner the United Nations decisively refuses to discuss provocative issues such as the "Hungarian question," and the sooner it gains sufficient strength to stop the Cold War atmosphere within the United Nations, the better it will be for the United Nations and world peace. The Soviet delegation will vote against the draft resolution on the so-called "Hungarian question."

### 美国操纵联大讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”  匈苏阿代表反击冷战势力挑衅

    美国操纵联大讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”
    匈苏阿代表反击冷战势力挑衅
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会全体会议8日开始讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”，这个问题是在美国和其他西方国家代表团的压力下列入会议议程的。
    联合国关于“匈牙利问题”特别代表孟罗（新西兰）向大会作了关于这个“问题”的报告。美国代表洛奇紧跟着发言，对匈牙利人民共和国和苏联进行了恶毒的攻击。
    匈牙利、苏联和阿尔巴尼亚的代表揭露了孟罗报告中的诽谤，并且指出，提出所谓“匈牙利问题”本身就证明，“冷战”维护者再一次企图阻挠国际局势的缓和。
    苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫说，苏联代表团已经一再指出，把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入会议议程是悍然破坏禁止干涉他国内政的联合国宪章。令人遗憾的是，由于某些国家代表团滥用他们的权力，联合国大会被卷入了这种危害和平事业和损害联合国威信的讨论。
    库兹涅佐夫指出，西方国家的一些人士，其中包括一些对外交政策有影响的人士不愿意看到国际气候转暖，他们仍然坚持“实力地位”政策。美国某些人士一直设法对一些不愿追随美国的国家进行颠覆活动。所谓“匈牙利问题”正是应当从这个角度来加以考虑的。如果要讨论这个问题，这主要应当讨论西方国家对其他国家内政的干涉。
    库兹涅佐夫强调指出，社会主义国家不想干涉其他国家的内政，它们有权要求其他国家也不干涉社会主义国家的内政。
    库兹涅佐夫最后说，联合国愈早地断然拒绝讨论像“匈牙利问题”这样一些挑衅性的问题，越早获得足够的力量来制止联合国内的冷战气氛，那对于联合国和世界和平就愈好，苏联代表团将投票反对关于所谓“匈牙利问题”的决议草案。
