Karamay, Urumqi, December 18 (from our correspondent) -- Xinjiang's newly built oil base, the Karamay Oilfield, comprehensively overfulfilled its production, exploration, and basic construction plans half a month ahead of schedule this year. As of the 16th, crude oil production had reached 107% of the annual state plan, equivalent to three times the actual output of last year. Crude oil processing completed 100.4%, drilling and well testing exceeded the state plan by 3.5% and 17.5% respectively, crude oil reserve exploration plan completed 100%, basic construction investment completed 103% of the annual state plan, and total output value exceeded the state plan by 4.5%. The average cost of crude oil extraction, crude oil processing, gasoline, diesel, and kerosene products for the whole year was 7.83% lower than the state plan, and the average cost of basic construction, including drilling exploration wells, production wells, and well testing, was 9.02% lower than the state plan.

This year is the first year that the Karamay Oilfield has shifted from exploration to crude oil production as the main focus. From the beginning of the year, the Karamay Mining Area Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has adhered to the Great Leap Forward, put politics in command, constantly criticized right-leaning, relaxed sentiments, and adopted the method of centralized leadership and vigorously launching mass movements to carry out a large-scale competition centered on oil extraction, driving the overall leap forward of drilling, well testing, oil transportation, oilfield basic construction, and other corresponding links. Each period of the competition has a central focus. In the first quarter, in response to the conservative idea that severe cold weather prevented continued comprehensive leap forward, a competition was organized to reverse the past situation of slackness at the beginning of the year and the failure to increase production, enabling oil extraction and drilling to create unprecedented high speeds in winter. In the second quarter, with solving the problem of high quality, high yield, and low cost as the center, the right-leaning conservative idea that high yield could not be achieved with high quality was criticized through debate, enabling drilling and oilfield construction projects to achieve a double harvest of high quality and high yield. The quality of machinery and automobile repairs was satisfactory to the users. Reworking accidents in oilfield construction projects were eliminated, and the quality of oil well drilling reached 100% qualification. In the third quarter, according to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the Mining Area Party Committee swept away right-leaning conservative ideas, organized an oil-winning battle work group, and launched a mine-wide oil-winning battle centered on managing oil wells and increasing crude oil production. After entering October, with the goal of stepping into 1960 ahead of schedule as the central content of the competition, the Mining Area Party Committee continuously organized work groups to go deep into the oil extraction, drilling, and basic construction sites to check the implementation of measures to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule, vigorously tackle weak links, and ensure that the entire mine completed the annual state plan ahead of schedule.

In completing this year's arduous production tasks, the Mining Area Party Committee has always adhered to the method of positive balance, using vigorous mass movements to overcome the imbalances that constantly appear in various links. Due to the heavy production tasks this year, imbalances frequently appeared in various links. After oil extraction leaped forward in the first half of the year, oil transportation, oil storage, and oil transportation could not keep up. The produced crude oil could not be transported out and there was nowhere to store it, which seriously affected the completion of the oil extraction plan. At that time, some cadres advocated stabilizing production levels and lowering targets to adapt to the balance of other links. The Mining Area Party Committee criticized this idea of passive balance, handed over the difficulties to the masses for discussion, and mobilized employees to find solutions together. As a result, the employees of each pump station on the oil pipeline found the potential for repairing diesel engines, oil pumps, and other equipment through vigorous mass movements. The time for overhauling a diesel engine in each pump station was shortened from the original 40 days to 40 hours. In this way, the working efficiency of oil transportation equipment in each pump station was nearly doubled, increasing the daily crude oil output by one-third. At the same time, the mining area also took active measures to build sub-pipelines and non-metallic oil pools on the oil pipeline, so that oil extraction, oil transportation, oil storage, and other corresponding links reached a balance.

In addition, the Mining Area Party Committee's reliance on the masses to strengthen management also played an important role in ensuring the completion of this year's plan. In July this year, due to the failure to keep up with oil well management, production was affected. The Mining Area Party Committee broke the routine and distributed oil well data to the oil extraction teams and the team's oil selection stations, and adopted the "three-way combination" method to manage oil wells (in the past, oil well data was controlled by technicians, and oil well technical management was the responsibility of technicians). Each oil extraction team and the team's oil selection station launched a competition to manage oil wells well, and quickly realized the management system of "every well has data, every well has measures," and established an oil well analysis and "consultation" system, which stabilized the oil well production and gradually increased it, and controlled the phenomenon of sudden decline and instability in oil well production. Crude oil production in the third quarter was almost equal to the total of the first half of the year. In the fourth quarter, oil well production generally stabilized and increased, even exceeding the third quarter. (Attached picture)

    树立竞赛中心　坚持积极平衡　依靠群众管理
    克拉玛依今年采油勘探建设三好
    本报乌鲁木齐18日电　新疆新建的石油基地——克拉玛依油区今年提前半月全面超额完成生产、勘探和基本建设计划。到16日为止，原油生产完成全年国家计划107％，等于去年实际产量的三倍。原油加工完成100.4％，钻井和试油分别超过国家计划3.5％和17.5％，原油储量勘探计划完成100％，基本建设投资额完成全年国家计划103％，总产值超额4.5％完成国家计划。全年采油、原油加工、汽油、柴油和煤油产品平均成本比国家计划降低了7.83％，基本建设方面包括钻凿探井、生产井和试油在内的平均成本比国家计划降低了9.02％。
    克拉玛依油区今年是从勘探转入以原油生产为主的头一年，中共克拉玛依矿区委员会从年初一开始就坚持大跃进，政治挂帅，不断批判右倾松劲情绪，采取集中领导，大搞群众运动的方法，开展以采油为中心，带动钻井、试油、输油、油田基本建设等相应环节全面跃进的大竞赛。在每个时期竞赛都有中心内容。第一季度针对严寒不能继续全面跃进的保守思想，组织竞赛，扭转了历年来年初松、生产跃不上去的局面，使采油和钻井在冬季都创造了空前的高速度。第二季度以解决优质、高产、低成本为中心，通过辩论批判了高产不能优质的右倾保守思想，使钻井和油田建设工程实现了优质高产双丰收，机械和汽车修理质量分别作到了使用单位满意。消灭了油田建设工程的返工事故，油井钻探质量达到口口合格。第三季度矿区党委根据八届八中全会决议精神，横扫右倾保守思想、组织了夺油大战工作团，开展了以管好油井、增产原油为中心的全矿夺油大战。进入10月以后，以提前踏进1960年为竞赛中心内容，矿区党委不断组织工作组，深入采油、钻井和基本建设工地，检查提前完成全年计划的措施落实情况，大抓薄弱环节，保证了全矿提前全面完成全年国家计划。
    在完成今年艰巨的生产任务中，矿区党委一直坚持积极平衡的办法，用大搞群众运动来克服各个环节不断出现的不平衡。由于今年生产任务繁重，各个环节经常出现不平衡。上半年采油跃上去以后，输油、储油和运油跟不上，生产出来的原油输不出去，又无处可储，严重地影响着采油计划的完成。当时有些干部主张稳定生产水平，降低指标，以适应其他环节的平衡。矿区党委批判了这种消极平衡思想，把困难交给群众讨论，发动职工共同想办法。结果输油管线各个泵站职工经过大搞群众运动，找出了维修柴油机、油泵等设备的潜力，各泵站中修一台柴油机的时间，从原来四十天缩短到四十小时。这样，每个泵站输油设备工作时效提高了近一倍，使每天原油输出量增加三分之一。与此同时，矿区又采取积极措施，在输油管线上增建副管线，建筑非金属油池，使采油、输油和储油等相应环节达到平衡。
    此外，矿区党委还依靠群众加强管理，对保证完成今年计划也起了重要作用。今年7月由于油井管理跟不上，产量受影响，矿区党委打破常规，把油井资料下放到采油队和队的选油站，采用“三结合”办法管理油井（过去油井资料由技术人员掌握，油井技术管理由技术人员负责）。各个采油队和队的选油站展开管好油井的竞赛，很快实现了“井井有资料，井井有措施”的管理制度，并建立了油井分析和“会诊”制度，使油井产量稳定下来，并逐步上升，控制了油井产量突然递减和不稳定的现象。第三季度的原油产量几乎等于前半年的总和，到了第四季度，油井产量普遍稳定上升，更超过了第三季度。（附图片）
