    African People's Anti-Colonial Struggle Continues to Develop
    Protests Against British Colonial Secretary's Activities in Africa
    Kenyan and Ugandan People Demonstrate
    Xinhua News Agency, December 14th dispatch from Nairobi: Approximately two hundred Africans in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, demonstrated on the 13th against the newly appointed British Colonial Secretary, Macleod, who had arrived there from Uganda.
    The demonstrators held placards, and their demands included the release of Kenyan nationalist leader Jomo Kenyatta.
    In a statement issued upon his arrival in Nairobi, Macleod said that he would be meeting with government and political leaders in Kenya as the Kenyan "constitutional" conference was to be held in London next month. This "constitutional" conference arranged by the British government aims to maintain British colonial rule and obstruct Kenya's achievement of independence.
    On the 11th, when Macleod arrived in Uganda, African people in Uganda also demonstrated against him, holding placards with the slogan "Uganda to Achieve Autonomy in 1960." (Attached picture)

    非洲人民反殖民主义斗争不断发展
    抗议英国殖民大臣到非洲活动
    怯尼亚乌干达人民示威
    据新华社14日讯　内罗毕消息：怯尼亚首府内罗毕的约两百名非洲人13日向从乌干达到达那里的英国新任殖民大臣麦克劳德示威。
    示威者举着标语牌，他们提出的要求中包括要求释放怯尼亚民族主义领袖乔莫·肯雅塔。
    麦克劳德在到达内罗毕后发表的一篇声明中说，由于下月就要在伦敦举行怯尼亚“宪法”会议，他在怯尼亚要同政府和政治领袖会谈。英国政府所安排的这次“宪法”会议目的在于维护英国的殖民统治，阻挠怯尼亚实现独立。
    11日，当麦克劳德到达乌干达时，乌干达非洲人民也曾经高举着“乌干达要在1960年实现自治”的标语牌向他示威。（附图片）
