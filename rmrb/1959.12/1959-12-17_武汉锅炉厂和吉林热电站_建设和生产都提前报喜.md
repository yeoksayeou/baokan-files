Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th December: The newly built Wuhan Boiler Factory has completed its annual plans for both basic construction and production ahead of schedule. The basic construction plan was completed 55 days ahead of schedule, and the first phase of the project, which the state required to be completed before the end of the year, was fully completed and put into production as early as September this year. The output of boiler products (calculated by evaporation) was completed 2.2% ahead of schedule by one month. In addition to the 35-ton and 65-ton boilers specified in the national plan, a 120-ton boiler was also produced. The annual profit target was overfulfilled by 101.5% two months ahead of schedule. Recently, the total output value plan, commodity output value plan, labor productivity plan, and product total cost plan were overfulfilled 21 days ahead of schedule. Product quality met requirements, and there were no major work-related injuries throughout the year.
　　Wuhan Boiler Factory is a modern power station boiler manufacturing factory that began construction in 1956. This year, while accelerating the speed of basic construction, the staff strengthened the trial production and production of products, and began manufacturing boilers as early as the first half of this year. After August and September, the staff responded to the call of the Party and quickly launched a high tide of increasing production and practicing economy, and carried out technical innovations on a large scale. The rationalization proposals put forward in two months were equivalent to 80% of those in the first half of the year, and many major innovation projects were realized. For example, the suggestion made by old worker Wang Yanchang to reduce the allowance for the blanking of the steam drum head saved a lot of valuable steel after it was implemented. Due to improved tools and operating methods, many workers completed their annual workload ahead of schedule. The factory's production level also rose steadily. With the total output value completed in August as 100, it soared to 390 in September, 420 in October, and continued to rise to 475 in November.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 16th December: Jilin Thermal Power Plant comprehensively completed this year's construction plan one month ahead of schedule. The high-temperature and high-pressure generating units and substation power distribution, water supply and other auxiliary projects planned to be installed this year have all been completed by the end of November and delivered to the production department for use. After operational tests, the quality has been proven to be good. At the same time, the project cost was reduced by 20% compared to the plan, and the labor productivity of all employees completed 100.9% of the plan. This year, no major accidents occurred in the entire plant.
　　This year, the installed capacity of Jilin Thermal Power Plant is more than the total of the four years from 1955 to 1958. In order to complete this arduous task, the staff of Jilin Power Generation Installation Company, who were responsible for the construction project, widely adopted three-dimensional cross-operation and parallel cross-operation construction methods, and closely cooperated between civil engineering and installation, between various types of work, and between functional departments and on-site construction, promoting the continuous acceleration of project progress. One unit installed in July this year took only 33 days, shortening the construction period by 40 days compared to the installation of the same type of unit last year. The construction period for another unit of the same type installed in September was shortened by another three days.

    武汉锅炉厂和吉林热电站
    建设和生产都提前报喜
    新华社武汉16日电　新建的武汉锅炉厂基本建设、生产双双提前完成年度计划。基本建设计划提前五十五天完成，国家要求年底前建成的第一期工程早在今年9月份就已全面建成并投入生产。锅炉产品的产量（按蒸发量计算）计划提前一个月超额2.2％完成，除国家计划的三十五吨、六十五吨两种锅炉外，还增产了一种一百二十吨的锅炉；全年上缴利润计划提前两个月超额完成101.5％；最近又提前二十一天超额完成了总产值计划、商品产值计划、劳动生产率计划和完成了产品总成本计划；产品质量达到要求；全年无重大工伤事故。
    武汉锅炉厂是1956年开始建设的现代化电站锅炉制造厂。今年以来，职工在加快基本建设速度的同时，加强了产品的试制和生产工作，早在今年上半年就开始制造锅炉。8、9月份以后，职工们响应党的号召，迅速掀起增产节约运动高潮，大搞技术革新。两个月中提出的合理化建议就相当于今年上半年的80％，而且实现了许多重大的革新项目。如老工人王彦昌提出的减少汽包封头下料余量的建议实现后，就节约了大量贵重钢材。由于改进工具和操作方法，很多工人提前完成了全年的工作量。全厂的生产水平也节节上升，以8月份完成的总产值为一百，9月份就猛升到三百九十，10月份又上升为四百二十，11月份继续上升为四百七十五。
    新华社长春16日电　吉林热电站提前一个月全面完成了今年的建设计划。今年计划安装的高温高压发电机组和变电配电、供水等附属工程，都已在11月底全部完成，并交付生产部门使用，经过运行试验，证明质量良好。与此同时，工程成本比计划降低20％，全员劳动生产率完成计划100.9％。今年以来，全厂没有发生重大事故。
    今年，吉林热电站的装机容量比1955年至1958年四年的总和还多。为了完成这个繁重的任务，担负建设工程的吉林发电安装公司职工，广泛采用立体交叉作业和平行交叉作业的施工方法，并在土建与安装之间、各工种之间、职能科室与现场施工之间密切协作，促进了工程进展速度不断加快。今年7月份安装的一台机组只用了三十三天，比去年安装同类型机组缩短工期四十天；9月份安装的另一台同类型机组工期又缩短了三天。
