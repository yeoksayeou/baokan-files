　　Golden Star Hero Stockbreeder
　　By our reporter Dai Feng
　　Petukhova is a member of the "October Cause" farm in Ryazan Oblast, a nationally renowned breeder who has twice been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. For more than twenty years, she has raised more than 6,000 cattle for the farm. The cattle she raises gain weight particularly quickly, and none have ever died due to illness or poor management. This year, in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, Petukhova made another outstanding contribution. The four breeders in her team raised 400 cattle in one year, an increase of almost two-thirds compared to last year. The rate of weight gain for livestock is no longer calculated by month or day, but by the hour! The cattle raised by Petukhova gain an average of nearly 50 grams per hour, reaching 1.15 kilograms per day. This is a rare record in the entire Oblast and even the whole country!
　　Passing through the center of Izhevo district, it is not far to the boundary of the "October Cause" farm. Before us is a large area of livestock sheds. These are two long rows of thirty or so neat livestock sheds, where more than 2,500 cattle and pigs are raised. The livestock sheds are tall and built of brick and wood. The walls are whitewashed, and plumes of hot air rise from the roofs. To the right of the livestock sheds is a large open space that stretches as far as the eye can see. Here, the grass is green in spring, summer, and autumn, and livestock graze here.
　　We met Petukhova in a cowshed. This famous hero is tall, wearing a black cloth work suit over a black coat, with sharp eyes and a vigorous spirit. She looks like a serious and enthusiastic woman. Petukhova led us into the cowshed, which was spacious and bright with fresh air. The cow stalls and walls were spotlessly clean. Each stall contained three to five calves, all round and fat. The golden yellow bedding was very soft, and the calves could sink into a pit when lying on it.
　　The livestock farm of the "October Cause" farm has completely adopted the method of classified and separate sheds, phased division of labor, and special personnel responsibility. Petukhova's team is specifically responsible for raising calves from twenty days to six months after birth. The feeding and management of this juvenile period is not only difficult but also extremely important. As Petukhova said, "If the juvenile livestock does not develop well, the meat and milk production will be directly affected when they grow up." For more than twenty years, Petukhova has come to the cowshed every morning at four or five o'clock and does not leave until late at night. People say that she "loves livestock as she loves her own children," which is not an exaggeration. Petukhova silently reached her hand into a fence, and the calf lying there immediately jumped up and stretched its head to affectionately lick Petukhova's hand. Petukhova introduced, "This calf has some special characteristics and doesn't like to move around. We keep it in a separate pen for feeding. If it is mixed with those little fellows who like to run and fight, it will definitely be bullied."
　　Petukhova can almost tell the characteristics and feeding methods of each cow. This reminds us of what the farm chairman Babaev said. He said, "Some people think that breeding work is simple, just feeding, watering, and cleaning. In fact, breeding work requires very careful attention, to understand the personality of each animal and treat them differently. This is not simple at all. In this regard, Petukhova can be regarded as an 'artist'."
　　Petukhova invited us to sit in her home. Her home is at the north end of the village by the street, a semi-new single-story wooden house. The living room is simply and plainly decorated, with a white-covered sofa against the wall, and a long table and several wooden chairs by the window. The fireplace was burning warmly. Two photos were hanging on the wall, one of Petukhova in the Kremlin conference hall. Petukhova also handed us two photos of Premier Zhou Enlai talking to Petukhova. It turned out that Petukhova was a representative of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. At this meeting, she met Premier Zhou Enlai.
　　When talking about work experience, Petukhova said, "We only have one experience: whether it is raising cattle or raising pigs, for breeders, we must first establish the idea of loving livestock as we love our own children. As the saying goes, it is up to people to make things happen. Any kind of work can achieve good results, as long as people wholeheartedly love their work and engage in creative labor."
　　Petukhova's and her team's specific breeding experience can be summarized into three aspects: (1) Strictly pay attention to selecting and breeding, and conduct special management of female livestock; (2) Establish a specialized feeding responsibility system with classified and separate sheds, phased division of labor, and strictly establish a "life order" for livestock with fixed time, fixed quantity, and multiple feedings; (3) Strictly implement cleaning and hygiene work, prevent diseases, and ensure the highest survival rate of livestock.
　　In terms of selecting and breeding, it is necessary to select strong, powerful, and wide-bodied livestock. Single mating, complex mating, artificial breeding and other methods are used for mating. Female livestock after pregnancy are generally taken care of by special personnel after one or two months, and supplemented with concentrated feed. When livestock are produced, female livestock enter the "delivery room" to give birth. The newly born young livestock should be washed clean. In the first few days, the young livestock live with the female livestock and should be fed colostrum. After about twenty days, they are fed in separate pens and troughs.
　　Petukhova has also established a strict "life system" for livestock. She feeds purebred dairy cows, purebred bulls, and beef cattle in separate sheds. Small cattle from twenty days to two months old are generally one cow per pen; three cows per pen from two to four months; and five cows per pen over four months. Feed three times a day: 6:00 am, 12:00 noon, and 7:00 pm. When feeding, ensure that the food utensils are clean, not cold or hot, first less and then more, and feed evenly. The temperature of hot food should not be lower than 36 degrees Celsius. Let the livestock move outside the shed once from 9:00 to 10:00 in the morning, and the time is longer in summer. In addition, each breeder has a livestock life log, which records in detail the characteristics of the livestock, specific feeding methods, and the daily diet, digestion, weight gain, etc. of the livestock. This scientific feeding method ensures the regularization of livestock life. The cattle fed by Petukhova can generally grow to about 250 kilograms within six months.
　　When talking about feed issues, Petukhova said: To make livestock gain weight quickly, feed is an important key. When feeding, it is necessary to reasonably match refined and coarse feed. Among milk, green grass, corn, oats, etc., green grass accounts for a large proportion. At the same time, it must be strictly timed and quantified. Water pipes, feeding vehicles, cleaning vehicles and other tools have also been built in the cowshed to replace heavy manual labor.
　　Establish a strict cleaning and hygiene system to prevent diseases. The cowshed is thoroughly cleaned twice a day, and cleaned several times on a small scale, shoveling feces and sweeping urine whenever it is seen. Each breeder must understand certain epidemic prevention and simple medical methods, and often pay attention to the state of the livestock. In this way, Petukhova's team has eliminated disease and death accidents, and the calves are all healthy. Many purebred dairy cows they raise produce 7,000 to 8,000 kilograms of milk per year.

　　金星英雄饲养员
　　本报记者　戴枫
    彼多霍娃是梁赞州“十月事业”农庄庄员，全苏闻名的荣获两次社会主义劳动英雄称号的饲养员。二十多年来，她为农庄喂大了六千多头牛。她喂的牛长肉特别快，而且从来没有因病或因管理不善而死过一头。今年，在这七年计划第一年里，彼多霍娃又作出了卓越的贡献，她领导的全组四个饲养员，一年中喂养大了四百头牛，比去年几乎增加了三分之二。牲畜长肉的速度不再是按月按日计算，而是按小时计算！彼多霍娃所饲养的牛每小时平均长肉将近五十克，一昼夜达一点一五公斤。这是全州也是全国罕有的纪录！
    穿过依齐甫区的中心，走不多远就到了“十月事业”农庄地界。眼前是一大片畜舍。这是两长排三十来个整齐的畜舍，这里喂养着二千五百多头牛、猪。畜舍高大，都是用砖木砌成的。墙粉刷得雪白，房顶上冒出一股股热气。畜舍右边，是一眼望不到边的大块空旷地。这里，春、夏、秋三季绿草常青，牲畜就在这儿放牧。
    我们在一个牛舍见到了彼多霍娃。这位闻名的英雄身材高大，黑色的大衣外边罩着一件黑布工作服，目光锋利，精神健旺。看得出是一位严肃而热忱的妇女。彼多霍娃领我们走进牛棚，这儿宽大敞亮，空气新鲜。牛栏架上、墙上都干净得一尘不染。每个栏里关着三、五头不等的牛犊子，个个溜圆肥胖。黄澄澄的垫草非常松软，小牛卧在上面可以陷下一个坑去。
    “十月事业”农庄的饲畜场完全采取了分类分棚，分期分工，专人负责的饲养方法。彼多霍娃的小组专门负责饲养出世后二十天到六个月的牛犊子。这段幼畜时期的饲养管理不但困难，而且极为重要。正如彼多霍娃说的，“幼畜发育不好，长大时出肉出奶都受直接影响”。彼多霍娃二十多年来如一日，每天清晨四、五点来到牛棚，直到深夜才肯离开。人们说她“爱畜如爱子”，一点也不夸大。彼多霍娃不作声地将手伸进一个栏栅，那只卧着的小牛立刻跳起，伸过头来亲切地舔着彼多霍娃的手。彼多霍娃介绍说：“这只小牛性格有些特别，不爱活动。我们把它单独放在一个栏喂养。它如果同那些爱跑好斗的小家伙混在一起，准要受欺侮。”
    彼多霍娃几乎能说出每头牛的特性和喂养方法。这使我们想到农庄主席巴巴耶夫的话。他说，“有人认为，饲养工作简单，不过是喂喂料、喂喂水、搞清洁而已。其实不然，饲养工作要求非常细心认真，要摸清每头牲畜的性格，分别对待喂养，这是极不简单的。在这方面，彼多霍娃可算是个‘艺术家’了。”
    彼多霍娃邀我们到她家里坐坐。她的家在村北头靠大街，是一幢半新的单层木头房子。客室里布置简单朴素，靠墙放着白套子的长沙发，靠窗一个长桌和几把木椅。壁炉烧得暖烘烘的。墙上挂着两幅照片，是彼多霍娃在克里姆林宫会议大厅里照的。彼多霍娃又递给我们两张照片，是周总理正在同彼多霍娃谈话的照片。原来，彼多霍娃是苏共第二十一次党代表大会的代表。这次会上，她遇见了周总理。
    谈到工作经验时，彼多霍娃说：“我们的经验只有一条：不管是养牛也好，养猪也好，对饲养员来说，首先必须树立爱畜如子的思想。俗语说得好，事在人为。任何一种工作都能获得好成绩，只要人们全心全意热爱自己的工作，创造性地从事劳动。”
    彼多霍娃同她的小组的具体饲养经验归结起来可以分为三个方面：（一）严格注意选种育种，对母畜进行特别管理；（二）建立分类分棚，分期分工的专人饲养负责制，严格建立定时定量，分次喂食的牲畜“生活秩序”；（三）严格执行清洁卫生工作，防止病疫，保证牲畜的最高成活率。
    在选种育种方面，要选择强壮、力大、体宽的牲畜。配种使用单配、复配，人工配殖等方法。怀孕后的母畜一般在一两个月后都有专人照顾，增喂精料。产畜时，母畜进“产房”生育。刚生下的幼畜要洗干净，最初几天幼畜与母畜一起生活，要喂初乳。二十天左右分栏分槽喂养。
    彼多霍娃还建立了一套严格的牲畜“生活制度”。她把纯种奶牛、纯种公牛、肉用牛分棚喂养。二十天到两个月的小牛，一般是一牛一栏；两个月到四个月的三牛一栏；四月以上的五牛一栏。一天喂食三次：早六点，中午十二点，晚七点。喂食时做到食具清洁，不冷不热，先少后多，喂得均匀。喂热食要保持温度不低于三十六度。上午九到十时让牲畜到棚外活动一次，夏天时间长些。此外，每个饲养员都有一本牲畜生活日志，详细记载着牲畜的特性、具体喂养法，以及每天牲畜饮食、消化，长肉度等等情况。这种科学的喂养方法，保证了牲畜生活的规律化。彼多霍娃所喂出的牛，六个月内一般可长到二百五十公斤左右。
    在谈到饲料问题时，彼多霍娃说：要使牲畜长肉快，饲料是重要的关键。喂料时要做到精粗饲料合理配搭。在牛奶、青草、玉米、燕麦等之间，青草占了很大比例。同时必须严格地定时定量。牛栏里还建有输水管，送料车，清洁车等等工具，代替了繁重的手工劳动。
    建立严格的清洁卫生制度，预防病疫。牛栏每天大清除两次，小清除数次，见粪就铲，见尿就扫。每个饲养员都要懂得一定的防疫与简单医疗法，经常注意牲畜的神态。这样彼多霍娃的小组杜绝了病亡事故，牛犊个个健壮。她们喂大的许多纯种奶牛每年产奶量达七、八千公斤。（附图片）
