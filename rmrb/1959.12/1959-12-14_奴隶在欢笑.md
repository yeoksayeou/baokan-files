    Slaves Are Laughing
    Shang Wenjian
    Blast Furnaces

    On the vast grassland, an iron and steel plant has been established, its fiery glow illuminating the excited and amazed eyes of the herders. The bellows huff and puff, singing the world's most magnificent song. From the furnace mouth, pale blue smoke spirals toward the snowy mountains...
    Ah! These are the first blast furnaces to appear on the grasslands in thousands of years. Eagles are startled and fly away, roe deer abandon their homes and flee. In this long-forgotten place, unmarked on the map, a brand-new golden age has begun!

    Who is the steelworker wielding the drill in front of the furnace? It is the slave, who was oppressed and never smiled in the past. Who is the girl carrying ore? It is the family member who was whipped and humiliated by the chieftain in the past. White-haired fathers and mothers, ah, they are laughing with tears in their eyes! Look, these hands that were tormented by the iron chains of slavery are now creating happiness on the free and prosperous land, creating a paradise that countless serfs dared not dream of.

    Slave, this short word containing pain and tears, is now thrown into the furnace by the herders. On the ground, the blood-stained iron shackles and instruments of torture are thrown into the furnace by the herders. And the old mother's mournful dirge, sung for sixty years, is also thrown into the furnace by the herders...

    Blast furnace, ah, you are the furnace of happiness! Tears are thrown in, and joy flows out! Barrenness is thrown in, and prosperity flows out! Iron shackles and instruments of torture are thrown in, and sickles and hunting rifles flow out!...

    The herders gallop across the grasslands, by the lakes, on the snowy mountains. They always love to gaze at the brightest, most magnificent place, where the iron and steel plant—this pearl of the grasslands—is shining brightly!

    The slaves have stood up, as majestic as the snow-capped mountains. The iron and steel plant has stood up, spewing clouds and smoke day and night. Look, look! On the vast grassland, the wind roars, the water rushes, and the red glow fills the sky!
        Socks

    People placed a pair of brand-new socks in Duo Ji's hands. This serf as old as a snow pine, this herdsman who has walked barefoot for sixty years, trembled as he held the socks, looked up at the sun, tears streaming down his face…

    The socks are worn on the feet, but warm the heart. The socks come from the interior, from a beautiful city that Duo Ji has never seen even in his dreams, from the magnificent factories of our Han brothers.

    Like an eagle regaining its wings, the democratic reforms have returned freedom to millions of slaves. Like Duo Ji, what they have lost is the fate of being enslaved and the tears of bitterness, and what they have gained is the entire sky, the grassland, the sun, cattle, sheep, tents, and socialism!

    Duo Ji put on his socks, one step, two steps… he walks like a child; as if he has never walked in these sixty years! How many feet, covered with thick calluses, have walked across snow-capped mountains and waded through icy rivers, strong and sturdy feet, that were buried in the suffering grasslands without ever wearing warm and soft socks. They died, and their families were even more saddened because the Buddha said that those who die barefoot cannot go to heaven.

    Today, heaven is on the grassland, Duo Ji can see it, he can touch it, he knows its taste in his heart.

    The joyful pot dance has begun! The green groves are filled with silver moonlight. The songs of the girls and the laughter of the JinZhu MaMi (Liberation Army) have merged into a huge wave of sound, awakening the sleeping kingfishers, as if the snow-capped mountains are also gently shaking. Look, thousands of feet wearing brand-new socks are stepping to the most enthusiastic beat, dancing with abandon. Ah, here, it is impossible to tell which pair is Duo Ji's socks, which pair is Zhuo Ma's socks… Ah, ha! A nation that has suffered so much is laughing heartily today!

    奴隶在欢笑
    商文健
    高炉群
    茫茫大草原上，炼铁厂建立起来了，火光熊熊，映照着牧民们兴奋而惊奇的眼睛；风箱呼呼，唱着世界上最雄壮的歌，炉口旋卷着淡蓝色的烟柱，向着雪山飞去……
    呵！这是千百年来草原上第一次出现的高炉群。大鹰被惊飞了，獐子弃家而逃。在这地图上还没有标出名字、被人们长久遗忘的地方，一个崭新的黄金时代开始了！
    手挥钢钎的炉前工是谁？是过去被压迫得从不曾欢笑的奴隶；背矿石的少女是谁？是过去被头人鞭打和凌辱的家人。白发蓬松的阿爹和阿妈呵，笑出了眼泪！看呵，这些被奴隶制的铁链折磨过的双手，今天，在自由富饶的土地上创造幸福，创造千百代农奴不敢梦想的天堂。
    奴隶，这个简短的词句里包含着的痛苦和眼泪，现在，牧民们把它扔进了炉中；地上，血迹斑斑的铁镣刑具，牧民们把它扔进了炉中；还有老阿妈唱了六十年的凄惨的悲歌，牧民们也把它扔进了炉中……
    炼铁炉呵，你是幸福的熔炉！泪水扔进去，欢乐流出来！荒凉扔进去，繁荣流出来！铁镣和刑具扔进去，麦镰和猎枪流出来！……
    牧民们在草原上纵马奔驰，在海子边，在雪山上，他们总爱向那最光明、最壮丽的地方眺望，那里，炼铁厂——这草原上的珍珠正在灼灼闪光呵！
    奴隶们站起来了，像雪山一样威严；炼铁厂站起来了，日夜喷吐着云烟。看呵，看呵！茫茫大草原上，风吼水响，红霞满天！
        袜　子
    人们把一双崭新的袜子，放在多吉的手上。这个雪松一样苍老的农奴呵，这个打了六十年赤脚的牧民呵，发抖的手捧着袜子，仰头望太阳，眼泪花花……
    袜子穿在脚上，暖在心里。袜子来自内地，来自多吉在梦中也没有见过的美丽的城市，来自汉族大哥雄伟的工厂里。
    像大鹰又得到了翅膀，民主改革把自由还给了千万奴隶。他们和多吉一样，失去的是被奴役的命运和辛酸的泪水，得到的是整个的天空、草原、太阳、牛羊、帐篷和社会主义！
    多吉穿上了袜子，一步，两步……他像孩子似地走着路；好像这六十年来，他从来没有走过路一样！有多少长满了厚茧的脚，走过雪山，趟过冰河，坚硬而粗壮的脚，一生没穿过温暖而柔软的袜子，就被埋葬在苦难的草原上。他们死了，亲人们却更加悲伤，因为，佛爷说赤脚死去的人，是上不了天堂的。
    如今天堂就在草原上，多吉看得见它，摸得到它，它是什么滋味，多吉心里全都知道。
    欢乐的锅庄跳起来了！绿色的林卡里盛满了银色的月光。少女们的歌声和金珠玛米（解放军）的笑声汇成一股巨大的音浪，惊醒了沉睡的翠鸟，仿佛雪山也在轻轻摇晃。看，千万双穿着崭新袜子的脚，踩着最热烈的节拍，在纵情地跳。呵，这里面分不出哪一双是多吉的袜子，哪一双是卓玛的袜子，……呵，呵！一个受尽了苦难的民族今天在纵情的欢笑！
