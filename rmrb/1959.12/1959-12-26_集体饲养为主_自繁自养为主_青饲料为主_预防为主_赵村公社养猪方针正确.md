Zhao Village Commune's Pig Raising Policy is Correct

(Our Dispatch) The Party Committee of Zhao Village People's Commune in Lushan County, Henan Province, relying on the masses to carry out the pig-raising movement, has achieved one pig per mu of cultivated land, promoted agricultural production increase, and promoted the comprehensive development of diversified operations. According to statistics in late November, the commune had 12,837 live pigs, of which 86.4% were collectively raised.

Zhao Village Commune is located in the deep mountainous area of ​​Funiu Mountain. Before liberation, a large amount of grain needed to be transferred from other places every year. Since liberation, although grain production has increased year by year, it was still not self-sufficient until 1957. In the spring of 1958, in order to further develop agricultural production, the commune party committee proposed the requirement of achieving one pig per mu of cultivated land. The Party Committee made a large calculation: it planned to develop 6,214 pigs by the end of the year, but there were only 314 sows. Based on each sow giving birth to two litters by the end of the year, with each litter having seven or eight piglets, a total of 4,800 piglets could be born, still short of 1,414 piglets. How to solve this problem? Some people advocated buying from outside, saying that it would be faster and easier. But most of the masses said, "Self-breeding and self-raising is the right way." Therefore, the Party Committee put forward the slogan of "keeping all sows and selecting boars to keep." The commune adopted the method of establishing breeding stations in every farm and breeding farms in every team, universally promoted the advanced experience of double mating and re-mating, and carried out the movement of all births and all surviving, so that the sow reproduction rate increased from an average of five or six piglets per litter in the past to seven or eight piglets. At the end of last year, there were only 625 sows, but now it has reached 3,210 sows. In the past year, a total of 7,890 piglets have been produced, which has played a decisive role in achieving one pig per mu of cultivated land.

Zhao Village Commune is a place with many mountains and abundant feed. The commune Party Committee has always emphasized using wild plants as feed and organized the masses to collect and store a large amount. Since the beginning of autumn this year, in order to meet the needs of the great development of pig raising, the Party Committee has also proposed the measures of "six collections" (collecting horns, collecting leaves, collecting roots, collecting shells, collecting hearts, collecting stalks) and "three搶 qiang (grabbing)" (搶 qiang before frost, 搶 qiang before freezing, 搶 qiang before heavy snow), calling on commune members to rush to collect pig feed. According to statistics at the end of November, the commune had collected 25.6 million catties of various feeds, which has prepared for the wintering of pigs and the great development next spring.

With the great development of pig raising, especially the great development of collective pig raising, the vast number of commune members are most worried about pigs getting sick, causing a large number of deaths. In order to prevent pig diseases, the commune and major brigade pig farms have established epidemic prevention agencies, and the animal husbandry school has been established in Dongping Brigade, and 150 epidemic prevention technicians have been trained in the past year. The commune has also established a medicine processing plant to ensure the normal development of epidemic prevention work and eliminate swine fever.

Relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, convening a representative meeting on pig production, grasping the key and the links according to the laws of the movement, and solving major problems is the leadership method of the Zhao Village Commune Party Committee. The commune has five pig-raising bases, including Nanyin, Xiaoercheng, Dongping, Erlangmiao, and Mazhuang. Party committee members often go deep into the bases to create experience, promote experience through representative meetings, and guide the development of the movement. In June, the Party Committee promoted the breeding experience of "one pig, ten piglets, and hundreds of grandchildren" in Nanyin Brigade and insisted on implementing the policy of self-breeding and self-raising. In October, the commune Party Committee also promoted the method of preparing "five-fragrance" feed in Xiaoercheng Brigade and the experience of fattening pigs, finely feeding coarse feed, and feeding raw feed cooked. Two months later, all the pigs in the commune gained weight.

　　集体饲养为主　自繁自养为主　青饲料为主　预防为主
    赵村公社养猪方针正确
    本报讯　河南省鲁山县赵村人民公社党委，依靠群众，开展养猪运动，实现了一亩耕地一头猪，促进了农业增产，推动了多种经营的全面发展。据11月下旬统计，全社实有生猪一万二千八百三十七头，其中集体饲养占86.4％。
    赵村公社在伏牛山深山区。解放前，每年都需要从外地调进大批粮食。解放以来，粮食产量虽然逐年提高，但是直到1957年粮食仍然不能自给。1958年春天，为了进一步发展农业生产，公社党委提出实现一亩耕地一头猪的要求。党委算了一笔大账：计划到年底发展猪六千二百一十四头，可是母猪只有三百一十四头，以每头到年底生两窝，每窝生七、八只小猪计算，共可生小猪四千八百头，尚缺一千四百一十四头。怎么解决这个问题？有人主张到外边买，说这样又快又省劲。但多数群众说：“自繁自养是正经办法。”于是党委提出了“母猪全留，公猪选留”的口号。公社采取场场建立配种站，队队建立繁殖场的办法，普遍推广双配复配的先进经验，开展全生、全活运动，使母猪繁殖率由过去每窝平均五、六头，提高到七、八头。去年年底只有母猪六百二十五头，目前已达到三千二百一十头，一年来共产小猪七千八百九十头，对实现一亩耕地一头猪起了决定性的作用。
    赵村公社是山多饲料广的地方。公社党委一直强调用野生植物作饲料，并组织群众大量采集贮存。今年入秋以来，为了适应生猪大发展的需要，党委又提出“六采”（采角、采叶、采根、采壳、采心、采秆）“三抢”（抢在霜前、抢在冻前、抢在大雪前）的措施，号召社员突击采集猪饲料。据11月底的统计，全社已采集各种饲料二千五百六十万斤，为猪过冬和明春大发展作好了准备。
    养猪大发展，特别是集体养猪大发展，广大社员最担心的是怕猪得病，造成大量死亡。为了防止猪病，公社和各大队猪场都建立了防疫机构，并在东坪大队建立了畜牧学校，一年来培养训练防疫技术员一百五十名。公社还建立医药加工厂，保证了防疫工作的正常开展，消灭了猪瘟。
    依靠群众，发动群众，召开生猪生产代表会，根据运动规律抓关键、抓环节，解决重大问题，是赵村公社党委的领导方法。全社有南荫、小尔城、东坪、二郎庙、马庄等五个养猪基地，党委委员经常深入基地创造经验，通过代表会议推广经验，指导运动发展。6月间，党委推广了在南荫大队的“一猪十仔百孙”的繁殖经验，坚持贯彻了自繁自养的方针。10月份，公社党委又推广了小尔城大队配制“五香”饲料的方法和进行生猪催肥、粗饲料细喂、生饲料熟喂的经验。两个月后，全社猪只头头增膘。
