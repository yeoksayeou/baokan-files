Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: University graduates who were assigned to the capital's civil engineering and construction departments from various universities last year have shown good performance in both political thought and professional skills over the past year.

These university graduates, whether in research, design, or construction work, can first consider the quality of construction projects, construction speed, and site conditions. Graduates who participated in design work had already done "real" graduation designs and worked on construction sites while in school, thus gaining experience in how to make design work faster, better, and more economical. Liang Boqian, a graduate of Tianjin University, used to like adding some winding and curving eaves to buildings when drawing design plans in school, thinking this would make them more "beautiful." Later, when he worked on construction sites, he felt that these small eaves took a lot of time to build and were not very beautiful. Therefore, when he participated in the interior decoration design of the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square after graduation, he paid attention to avoiding these impractical shortcomings and drew engineering drawings that met the requirements. Graduates participating in research work can also embody the spirit of scientific research serving production and practical needs. Wan Shichang, a graduate of Tsinghua University who was assigned to the China Academy of Building Research of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, is conducting research on "vibration" science, a research topic that has not been well resolved in current civil engineering. Wan Shichang and others realized when doing their graduation design in school that it was closely related to the life of buildings and the saving of building materials, so after accepting the topic, they were able to leave the research building and go to construction sites with various characteristics to collect materials. In this research institute, more than eighty university graduates who were assigned last year are simultaneously conducting research on issues that urgently need to be resolved, such as soil pressure, simplified shell calculations, and the design of hydraulic turbine power foundations. Some have applied the "native and foreign combined" methods they used during labor in their work.

These university graduates generally dare to think and act in their work, learn humbly, and pay attention to relying on the masses. When participating in the design of key projects in the capital, graduates assigned to the Beijing Urban Planning Bureau Design Institute moved the design office to the construction site with the engineers, designing while soliciting the opinions of veteran workers and modifying as they went, so that the engineering drawings could be used for construction as soon as they were completed. Li Zhenlou, a veteran worker at the Beijing Installation Company, praised the university students working with them for being hardworking, eager to learn, and unpretentious. These young people also enthusiastically taught theory to the workers, and some taught classes in technical training courses.

Most of the more than one hundred university graduates who were assigned to the China Academy of Building Research of the Ministry of Construction Engineering last year and this summer were able to take over special research after half a year of training. Among them, more than eighty graduates who were assigned last year from Tsinghua, Tianjin, Nanjing, Northwest, Tongji and other universities have made preliminary achievements in research on foundation and earthquake resistance and have built a "prestressed concrete research base" for testing new structural technologies; in the past, it took graduate one or two years of work experience to undertake deeper research. Many graduates who were assigned to the Beijing Urban Planning Bureau Design Institute to work on design directly participated in the design of key construction projects such as the Great Hall of the People and the National Cultural Palace under the guidance of engineers, and the engineering blueprints they drew basically met the specifications. Before liberation, university graduates generally had to work as draftsmen for about five or six years before they could do design work. Graduates assigned to construction work posts in the machinery, installation, and engineering companies of the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau can familiarize themselves with the construction site's construction equipment, engineering procedures, and labor force within one or two months, and can quickly cooperate with foremen and workers to carry out work. Song Wanru, a technician at the Fourth Engineering Company of the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau, graduated from Taiyuan University of Technology last winter and came to a construction site in the capital to work on technical innovation. In ten months, she reviewed, improved, and promoted more than twenty advanced technologies and was named a youth red banner pacesetter in the company. (Attached pictures)

### 肯干肯学　成绩显著  去年分配到首都建筑部门的大学生表现好

    肯干肯学　成绩显著
    去年分配到首都建筑部门的大学生表现好
    新华社4日讯　去年从各地高等学校分配到首都土木建筑部门工作的毕业生，一年来不论在政治思想和业务方面都有较好的表现。
    这些大学毕业生在研究、设计或施工工作中，都能首先为建筑工程的质量、施工速度和工地条件着想。参加设计工作的毕业生，在学校时就曾经做过“真刀真枪”的毕业设计和去工地劳动过，因此获得了设计工作如何多、快、好、省的锻炼。天津大学毕业生梁伯谦过去在学校绘设计图时，喜欢在建筑物上加上一些弯弯曲曲的小檐，以为这样可以“美观”些。后来他到工地劳动，感到这种小檐施工起来要花很多时间，也并不怎么美观。于是他毕业后参加天安门前人民大会堂的内部装修设计时，就注意避免了这种不切实际的缺点，绘出了合乎要求的工程图。参加研究工作的毕业生，也能在工作中体现科学研究为生产为实际服务的精神。分配在建筑工程部建筑科学研究院工作的清华大学毕业生万世昌等正在进行“震动”学方面的研究，这个研究课题是当前土木建筑学中还没有很好解决的。万世昌等在学校里做毕业设计时，就曾体会到它同建筑物寿命和节约建筑材料密切有关，因此他们在接受课题后能走出研究室大楼，到具有各种不同特点的工程工地上去搜集材料。在这个研究院里，去年分配来的八十多名大学毕业生，正在同时进行着当前急需解决的关于土壤压力、壳体简化计算、水轮机动力基础设计等问题的研究，有的在工作中运用了自己在劳动中用过的“土洋结合”办法。
    这些大学毕业生在工作中一般都敢想敢做，虚心学习，注意依靠群众。分配到北京市城市规划局设计院的毕业生在参加首都重点工程的设计时，曾随工程师们把设计室搬到工地上，一边设计，一边征求老工人的意见，一边修改，使工程图一出手就能施工。北京市安装公司老工人李珍楼称赞同他们一起工作的大学生肯干肯学，没架子。这些青年还热心地把理论教给工人，有的在技术训练班里教课。
    建筑工程部建筑科学研究院去年和今夏分配来的一百多名大学毕业生，大多数人经过半年培养就能接手做专题研究，其中去年从清华、天津、南京、西北、同济等大学分配来的八十多名毕业生，已经在有关地基基础、抗震等方面的研究中作出初步成绩，并且建成了试验新的结构技术用的“预应力混凝土研究基地”；而以往年毕业生都要经过一两年的工作锻炼才能担任较深的专题研究。分配在北京市城市规划局设计院担任设计工作的许多毕业生，一到工作岗位后，就在工程师指导下直接参加人民大会堂、民族文化宫等重点建筑工程的设计，他们绘出的工程蓝图基本上都合乎规格。而在解放前一般大学毕业生大约要做五六年描图员以后才能做设计工作。分配到北京市建筑工程局的机械、安装、工程公司等施工工作岗位的毕业生，一两个月内就能熟悉工地上施工设备、工程工序和人力等情况，能很快地同工长、工人合作进行工作。北京市建筑工程局第四工程公司技术员宋宛如，去年冬天从太原工学院毕业后，来首都一个工地担任了技术革新方面的工作，十个月中她经手鉴定、改进和推广了二十多项先进技术，被评为全公司的青年红旗手。（附图片）
