    Self-Reliance and Diligent Production, Supporting Animal Husbandry with Agriculture and Agriculture with Animal Husbandry
    Hou Tingren Sets an Example for Comprehensive Mountain Development
    Zhuxi Comprehensive Farm Starts from Scratch in High-Altitude Mountain Areas with Thriving Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations, and Industry
    (Our Dispatch) The Zhuxi Comprehensive Farm in Hubei Province, led by national agricultural labor model Hou Tingren, has adhered to the principle of "supporting the farm with the farm, supporting animal husbandry with agriculture, supporting agriculture with animal husbandry, and comprehensively developing mountain areas" for the past seven years. Starting from scratch, it has built a new type of socialist agricultural enterprise with thriving agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and industry in a high-altitude mountain area.
    When the farm was first established seven years ago, it had only seven workers, more than fifty mu of thin hillside land, and four dilapidated thatched houses. The farm is located in a high mountain range with an altitude of more than two thousand meters and an area of more than one thousand square miles, which is desolate and uninhabited. After seven years of diligent and frugal management, it has grown from small to large, from agriculture to animal husbandry, and agriculture and animal husbandry have further promoted the comprehensive development of local specialties, sideline occupations, and processing industries. Now the farm has more than 280 employees, more than 2,000 mu of cultivated land, 300 houses, more than 300 cattle, horses, and mules, 560 pigs, and flocks of chickens, ducks, sheep, and rabbits; 1,600 mu are planted with medicinal materials (codonopsis, scrophularia, angelica, coptis, etc.), as well as white fungus, mushrooms, raw lacquer, and other local specialties; and many processing plants such as paper mills, wineries, sugar factories, and ham factories have been established.
    In 1952, Communist Party member Hou Tingren accepted the instructions of the county party committee to start a farm in Sanhe Township (a remote mountain area bordering Hubei, Shaanxi, and Sichuan) in a high-altitude area. At that time, someone said to him: "To run a farm in a mountain area, you have to rely on the government to provide people and money; without money, nothing can be done." But Hou Tingren believed that the mountain area had inexhaustible natural resources. He did not ask the state for a penny and settled down in the barren mountains to start a business. With the support of the local party committee, he set up a farm and adopted the method of exchanging labor with local people to reclaim wasteland. In 1953, both rice and wheat had bumper harvests, with an income of more than 44,000 catties of grain. In addition to leaving food for the farm's personnel, 30,000 catties of grain were sold to the state; with the money, production tools and cattle were purchased, and pig farms and livestock farms were added. A year later, the pig farms and livestock farms also had income, and medicinal material farms were established; raising pigs and other livestock and poultry provided a large amount of fertilizer, which in turn strongly supported agricultural production. With the gradual development and growth of agriculture and animal husbandry, the funds became abundant and the production raw materials became rich, and paper mills, sugar factories, wineries, ham processing plants, etc. were established; the wineries and sugar factories provided a large amount of concentrated feed for livestock, which enabled the livestock farms to develop faster. The more pigs, sheep, and cattle, the more fertilizer, and the higher the grain yield year after year. In this way, promoting each other, the farm quickly developed and grew stronger. The soil in this mountain area is barren, and the grain yield per mu has always been only a few dozen catties, but because the farm has sufficient fertilizer and implements technical measures to increase production, the grain yield has increased dramatically. In 1958, the average yield per mu was 570 catties for wheat and 630 catties for rice; this year, the wheat yield has increased to 700 catties, and the rice yield has increased to more than 800 catties, which is about twice as high as the average yield of the people's communes around the farm.
    In terms of running the farm diligently and frugally and supporting the farm with the farm, Hou Tingren is good at using the characteristics and favorable conditions of the mountain area. The methods he proposed, such as "starting small to grow big, starting near to go far" and "using local materials and hatching eggs in the nest," are the crystallization of experience in developing mountain area production. Taking the development of medicinal material production as an example, their approach is to first go to the mountains to dig wild medicinal materials, sell a part to solve the expenses of manual labor and food, and transplant a part into cultivated medicinal materials to set up a medicinal material farm. The medicinal material farm then grows from small to large, and constantly expands. At the same time, according to the different characteristics of various medicinal materials and the different speeds of returns, the different characteristics are used in the cultivation of cultivated medicinal materials to support each other. For example, coptis and codonopsis grow slowly and yield slowly, while scrophularia, angelica, and schizonepeta have yields in the same year, so the former and the latter are developed simultaneously, with the faster-yielding supporting the slower-yielding. The establishment and development of animal husbandry and processing industries are mainly "using local materials and hatching eggs in the nest." For example, there are many wild lacquer trees in Qishuping, so they organize specialists to harvest wild lacquer for processing; the wild grass on Dahuayuan Mountain is abundant, so they set up a livestock farm there; there are many wild bamboos in Wangjiahe, so they opened a paper mill there; the soil in Dagou is suitable for growing sugar beets, so they expanded the planting area of sugar beets on the spot and opened a sugar factory; in addition, pig farms are set up near wineries and sugar factories, ham processing plants are set up near pig farms, and at the same time, the more pigs and the more fertilizer, the continuous expansion of the crop cultivation area....
    The high-altitude mountain areas, which have always been considered to have high mountains and thin land, are rapidly changing their poor face in front of heroes like Hou Tingren who control the mountains. Now Hubei Province has launched a vigorous mass movement to control water, control mountains, and control soil, and slogans of "learning from Hou Tingren and catching up with Hou Tingren" have been put forward everywhere. Fifty-one advanced production teams in various communes in Zhuxi County have basically caught up with the farm led by Hou Tingren, and more than 530 cadres, farm workers, and commune members in the county have been selected by the masses as "Hou Tingren-style" figures.

    自力更生勤劳生产  以农养牧以牧支农
    侯廷仁树立全面开发山区榜样
    竹溪综合农场在高寒山区白手起家农牧副工百业兴旺
    本报讯　全国农业劳动模范侯廷仁领导的湖北省竹溪综合农场，建场七年来，坚持“以场养场，以农养牧，以牧支农，全面开发
  山区”的原则，白手起家，在高寒山区建设成一个百业兴旺综合发展的社会主义新型农业企业。
    这个农场在七年前开始创办时，只有七个工人、五十多亩山坡薄地、四间破草房。这个农场座落在海拔两千多米高、方圆一千多华里的荒无人烟的高山峻岭上，经过七年来勤俭办场，由小到大，由农到牧，农牧进一步带动土特产、副业和加工业全面发展。现在全场已有二百八十多个职工，两千多亩耕地，三百间房屋，养牛、马、骡三百多头，猪五百六十头，鸡、鸭、羊、兔成群；种药材（党参、玄参、当归、黄连等）一千六百亩，还有白木耳、香菌、生漆等各种土特产；建立了纸厂、酒厂、糖厂、火腿厂等许多加工厂。
    1952年，共产党员侯廷仁接受县委指示，到高山地区三合乡（湖北与陕西、四川交界的荒山）创办农场。当时有人对他说：“山区办农场，要靠政府出人出钱；没有钱，啥事也办不成。”可是侯廷仁认为山区有取之不尽的自然资源，他没有向国家要一文钱，就在荒山上安家立业了。他在当地党委的支持下办起了农场，采取和当地群众互相换工的办法开荒。1953年，稻麦两季丰收，收入四万四千多斤粮食，除留下本场人员的口粮，卖给国家三万斤粮食；得了钱，添置生产工具、耕牛，又增设了养猪场、畜牧场。一年后，养猪场和畜牧场又有了收入，又办起了药材场；养猪和其他家畜家禽提供了大量肥料，反过来有力地支援了农业生产。农业与畜牧业的逐步发展壮大，资金雄厚了，生产原料丰富了，又开办了纸厂、糖厂、酒厂、火腿加工厂等；酒厂、糖厂又为牲畜提供了大量的精饲料，使畜牧场更快地发展，猪、羊、牛愈多，肥料也愈多，粮食产量也就年年提高。如此互相促进，农场迅速发展壮大起来。这个山区土质瘠薄，粮食历来亩产量只有几十斤，但是这个农场由于肥料充足，加上贯彻增产的技术措施，粮食产量突飞猛进。1958年平均亩产小麦五百七十斤，水稻六百三十斤；今年的小麦产量又提高到七百斤，水稻提高到八百斤以上，比农场周围的人民公社平均产量高一倍左右。
    侯廷仁在勤俭办场、以场养场方面，善于利用山区特点和有利条件，他所提出的“以小养大，以近养远”和“就地取材、就窝繁蛋”等办法，就是开发山区生产经验的结晶。以发展药材生产为例，他们的做法首先是上山挖野生药材，一部分卖钱解决人工吃食等开支，一部分移植为家生药材，办起了药材场，药材场又由小到大，不断发展扩大。同时，根据各种药材生长的特点不同，收益快慢不同，在培植家生药材中利用其不同特点，使之互相支援，如黄连、党参生长慢收益慢，而玄参、当归、荆芥等当年就有收益，于是把前后两种搭配同时发展，以收益快的支援收益慢的。畜牧及加工业的建立和发展，主要是“就地取材，就窝繁蛋”。如漆树坪的野生漆树很多，他们就组织专人采割野漆加工；大花园山上的野草丰盛，就在那里办起了畜牧场；王家河的野竹子多，在那里开办了造纸厂；大沟的土地土质适合种甜菜，就地扩大甜菜种植面积，并开办了一所糖厂；此外，酒厂、糖厂附近办养猪场，养猪场附近办起火腿加工厂，同时猪多肥多又不断扩大农作物耕作区……。
    一向被人们认为山高地薄的高寒山区，在侯廷仁式的治山英雄面前，迅速改变着贫困的面貌。现在湖北省已经掀起了轰轰烈烈的治水治山治土的群众运动，到处提出了“学侯廷仁、赶侯廷仁”的行动口号。竹溪县各公社有五十一个先进的生产队，基本赶上了侯廷仁领导的农场，全县有五百三十多个干部和农场工人、公社社员，已经被群众评选为“侯廷仁式”的人物。（附图片）
