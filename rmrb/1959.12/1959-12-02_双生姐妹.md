　　One cold and windy night, the clock had struck past eleven. Liu Qizhen was lying in bed, unable to sleep, worrying about the children in her class. Every day at this time, Liu Qizhen would be with the children, watching them sleep, checking if anyone had kicked off their blankets, and adding extra blankets to those who had thin ones. Today was her day off, and she had come home to sleep, but her heart was still at the kindergarten. She was most worried about the twin sisters, Han Liu and Han Li. They were both so weak, and the weather was so cold tonight. When she left, she had clearly instructed the auntie taking over her shift, but she still couldn't help but worry. The wind grew stronger, and the glass on the windows rattled. "Could the wind have blown the window open?" Liu Qizhen quickly got up, put on her clothes, and went outside. When she reached the kindergarten, she gently opened the door to the small class's dormitory. The room was so quiet, and the children were sleeping soundly. She touched Han Liu and Han Li's feet and checked on the other children before returning home to sleep with a sense of relief.

　　Han Liu and Han Li are the twin daughters of Zhang Xue, a worker at the Liulihe Cement Factory. During the Great Leap Forward last year, Zhang Xue's wife, like other workers' families, left home to participate in construction. She entrusted her two weak children to the kindergarten to be taken care of. These two children, barely one year old, were so thin that they couldn't even sit up. Everyone who saw them said, "These children will be hard to keep alive!" The aunties were also afraid that they wouldn't be able to raise them well. But Liu Qizhen thought that if she wanted the children's mother to work with peace of mind, then they, as kindergarten teachers, should shoulder the responsibility of being a mother.

　　From then on, Liu Qizhen regarded these twin sisters as her own children. She took extra special care of these two weakest children in the class. Han Li often had digestive problems, so while the other children ate eggs, Liu Qizhen would give her egg yolks. Sometimes, the child didn't eat much, and Liu Qizhen was afraid she would be hungry, so she would feed her an extra time. If one type of food wasn't suitable, she would often change it. No matter how busy she was, Liu Qizhen would always pick up the children and play with them for a while, just like a mother would. Han Liu and Han Li have grown well under the care of Liu Qizhen and the other aunties. When Han Liu first stood up holding onto the small bed and smiled at her, Liu Qizhen smiled happily too.

    双生姐妹
    升光
    一个寒风凛烈的夜晚，钟已敲过十一点，刘启贞躺在床上怎么也睡不着，她惦记着班里的孩子们。每天这个时候，刘启贞还陪着孩子们，看着他们睡觉，看看有没有踢掉被子的，谁的被子薄，多给盖上点。今天是她休息，回家睡来了，可是心还在幼儿园。最放心不下的是汉琉和汉璃姐妹俩。他俩身体太弱了，今夜天气又那么冷，她临回来的时候，和接班的阿姨交代很清楚，可是还是放心不下。风越刮越大了，窗上的玻璃吹得直响。“别是窗户被风吹开了吧！”刘启贞赶忙起来穿好衣服就往外走，当她走到幼儿园，轻轻拉开小班寝室的门，屋子里是那么安静，孩子们睡得正香甜，她摸了摸汉琉和汉璃的脚，又看了看别的孩子，才放心地回家去睡觉。
    汉琉和汉璃，是琉璃河水泥厂工人张学的一对双生女儿。去年大跃进，张学的爱人和其他职工家属一样，从家里走出来参加到建设岗位。她把两个病弱的孩子交给幼儿园照管，这两个刚满一岁的孩子，瘦得连坐都不会。谁见了都说：这孩子可难活啊！阿姨们也怕养不好。可是刘启贞想，要想让孩子妈妈安心工作，我们做保育员的就应该把做母亲的责任承担下来。
    从此，刘启贞把这对双生姐妹看成了自己的孩子。她对这两个班里最弱的孩子，照顾得格外周到。汉璃经常消化不好，别的小孩吃鸡蛋，刘启贞就给她吃蛋黄。有时，孩子吃东西不多，刘启贞怕她饿，就多喂一次。吃这样东西不合适，就经常换样。每天刘启贞不管怎样忙，总要像妈妈那样，把孩子抱起来，逗着玩一会。汉琉和汉璃在刘启贞和阿姨们的照顾下，已经长好了。当汉琉第一次扶着小床站起来向她微笑的时候，刘启贞也高兴地笑了起来。
