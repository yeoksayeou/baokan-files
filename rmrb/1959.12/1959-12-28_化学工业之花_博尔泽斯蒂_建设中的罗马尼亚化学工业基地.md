The Flower of the Chemical Industry

Borzeşti – A Romanian Chemical Industrial Base Under Construction

In Borzeşti, in the Moldavian province of eastern Romania, one of Europe's largest chemical industrial conglomerates is being rapidly built.

Amazing Underground Treasures

Borzeşti was originally a small village on the banks of the Trotuș River. In the past, people couldn't even find it on the map of Romania. As early as five hundred years ago, rich natural resources had been discovered around Borzeşti. However, before liberation, people paid no attention to it at all. It was not until the Romanian people became the masters of their country that Borzeşti received the attention it deserved. After exploration, it was proven that this area contains abundant resources such as salt, oil, and mineral springs. The proven reserves of salt alone are enough to supply the world for five hundred years.

A Magnificent Construction Scene

Borzeşti, like a flower waiting to bloom, is thriving and growing rapidly on Romanian soil. After several years of construction, it has already taken the initial shape of a chemical industrial city, and in the near future, it will become Romania's largest chemical industrial base.

The construction scale of this emerging chemical industrial city is quite large. The entire conglomerate covers an area of one thousand hectares, stretching for several kilometers, including power stations, refineries, chemical plants, rubber factories, and so on. When it is fully completed, the electricity it consumes will exceed that of Bucharest before the war. Currently, construction is proceeding rapidly. The astonishing scale of the project can be seen by simply listing a few figures: its construction project requires 200 tons of cement, 150,000 bricks, and seven train cars of wood every day. The combined length of various pipelines being laid reaches 3,100 kilometers.

Bright Prospects for Industrial Development

Due to the abundance of raw materials, Borzeşti has a bright future for the development of its chemical industry, because the chemical industry has low costs, high output value, and wide applications. For example, after mineral oil is manufactured by chemical methods, it will become synthetic rubber and plastics, and its value will increase dozens of times. The various exquisite products made from the salt here through the replication of the forty-four workshops of the alkali production enterprise will make it hard to believe that they are made of salt. Also, mineral water and natural gas will be made into caustic soda, polychlorides, synthetic rubber, carbolic acid, and other products in this chemical plant.

Borzeşti not only has many products, but also a very high output. By 1963, the synthetic rubber produced here will be equal to the current total output of synthetic rubber in West Germany. The caustic soda produced here can make 350,000 tons of soap every year. Calculated by the average Romanian population, each person can get 42 pounds of soap. Due to the high output and high profits, when the entire enterprise is completed and put into production, its entire construction investment can be recovered in less than two and a half years. And its annual total output value will be equal to 5% of Romania's entire national budget this year. What a huge wealth!

The Happy Life of the Builders

Like this young chemical industrial city, the builders participating in Borzeşti's construction are also young. The vast majority of the 10,000 builders here are young people. For example, the average age of the power plant's employees is twenty-nine years old. The manager is the oldest, but he is only forty years old. All this makes Borzeşti full of youthful vitality.

Currently, on the beautiful banks of the Trotuș River, beautiful employee residences have been built, and stores serving employees have also opened. The children of employees have entered new schools. Many welfare and cultural facilities are also under construction. Every holiday, groups of men and women stroll on the wide roads and dance on the beautiful river banks. They sing happily about today's happiness and are prepared to contribute even greater strength to the country's industrial construction.

　　化学工业之花
    博尔泽斯蒂——建设中的罗马尼亚化学工业基地
    在罗马尼亚东部摩尔多瓦省的博尔泽斯蒂，欧洲最大的化学工业联合企业之一正在加速兴建中。地下宝藏惊人丰富
    博尔泽斯蒂原来是特罗塔斯河畔的一个小村庄，过去，人们在罗马尼亚的地图上还找不到它。早在五百年前，博尔泽斯蒂的周围就已经发现了丰富的天然资源。可是，在解放前，人们根本没有注意它。直到罗马尼亚人民成了国家的主人，博尔泽斯蒂才受到了应得的重视。经过勘探证明，这个地区蕴藏着丰富的盐、石油、矿泉……等资源。单是已查明的盐的蕴藏量，就足够供应全世界五百年的需要。
    建设图景壮丽雄伟
    博尔泽斯蒂像含苞待放的花朵一样，在罗马尼亚的土地上欣欣向荣地迅速成长。经过几年来的建设，它已经初具一个化学工业城的规模，而不久的将来，它就要成为罗马尼亚最大的化学工业基地。
    这个新兴的化学工业城的建设规模是相当巨大的。整个联合企业占地一千公顷，蜿蜒几公里，包括发电站、精炼所、化学工厂、橡胶工厂等等。当它全部建成后，它所消费的电力将要超过战前的布加勒斯特。目前，建设工程正在加速进行。只要列举下面几个数字，就可见工程规模的惊人：每天它的建筑工程需要二百吨水泥、十五万块砖、七个火车车皮的木材。正在铺设的各种管道的长度加起来达三千一百公里。
    工业发展前程远大
    由于有着丰富的原料，博尔泽斯蒂发展化学工业的前途是远大的。因为化学工业成本低、产值高、用途广。例如，矿物油经过化学方法制造后，将成为合成橡胶和塑料，价值将要提高几十倍。这里的盐经过制碱企业的四十四个车间的复制，制出来的各种精美产品将使人很难相信它们就是用盐做的。又如，矿泉水和天然气将在这个化工厂制成苛性苏打、多氯化物、合成橡胶、石炭酸等产品。
    博尔泽斯蒂不仅产品多，而且产量也是很高的，到1963年，这里所产的合成橡胶将等于目前西德合成橡胶总产量，它所产的苛性苏打每年可制成三十五万吨肥皂，按罗马尼亚人口平均计算，每人可得到四十二磅肥皂。由于产量高，利润多，当这个企业全部建成投入生产，不需两年半，它的全部建设投资就可以收回。而它的每年总产值将等于今年罗马尼亚整个国家预算的5％。这是多么巨大的财富！
    建设者的幸福生活
    像这个年轻的化学工业城一样，参加博尔泽斯蒂的建设者也是年青的。这儿一万名建设者中，绝大多数是青年人。例如发电站的职工平均年龄为二十九岁。经理是最年长的，也只有四十岁。这一切使博尔泽斯蒂充满了青春的生气。
    目前，在风光秀丽的特罗塔斯河畔，一幢幢漂亮的职工住宅已经建成了，为职工服务的商店也开设了。职工子弟进入了新的学校。许多福利和文化设施也正在动工兴建。每当假日，一群群的男女漫步在宽敞的马路上，在美丽的河畔歌舞。他们欢唱着幸福的今天，准备为祖国工业建设献出更大的力量。　　　　（鲁）（附图片）
