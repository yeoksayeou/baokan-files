　　What Happened During Eisenhower's Overseas Visit
　　Eisenhower has concluded his eleven-nation tour of Western Europe, South Asia, and North Africa. People once held various hopes for Eisenhower's trip, hoping he would use this opportunity to contribute to easing international tensions. This hope is understandable because Eisenhower and some other responsible people in the United States have recently spoken many times about the U.S. government's desire for peace, disarmament, and the easing of international tensions, and Eisenhower himself called his own long journey a "visit of peace and goodwill."

　　Indeed, Eisenhower continued to make some remarks about peace during his overseas visit. He said that "the United States is striving for peace," that the United States is willing to "resolve international disputes with the conference table rather than with force," that the United States is "determined to implement policies aimed at alleviating the burden of armaments worldwide," and that the deepest desire of the United States is to "build a world in which all nations can enjoy prosperity in freedom, justice, and peace without being harmed or fearing." As long as these remarks can be reflected in the actual actions of the United States, then the international situation can indeed be improved, and people will have to look at the policies of the United States with new eyes.

　　But one cannot help but be surprised to note that while talking about peace during his visit, Eisenhower spent even more time talking about maintaining a strong military strength and strengthening military blocs. Eisenhower said that the West must "maintain military strength" and "develop and maintain this strength"; saying that "the North Atlantic Alliance remains the cornerstone of Western foreign policy" and that the United States is determined to "continue to strongly support" the Southeast Asia military bloc and the Middle East military bloc. He said so much in this regard that even the American "New York Post" could not help but admit that Eisenhower's visit was "like a general going to the front line to boost morale." Among the eleven countries visited by the US President, eight have US military bases, and for these eight countries, the US President has not made any indication that the US will abandon or weaken these bases. The only exception may be Morocco, where the United States has long been touting its intention to abandon military bases. But even though Morocco has been demanding the abolition of the obligations assumed during the French colonial rule, demanding that the United States abolish its military bases there and withdraw US troops, Eisenhower, upon arriving in Casablanca, still insisted that Morocco agree to allow the United States to maintain its four bases until 1963. This is because in the US war preparation plan, the US will mass-produce missiles four years later, and the air force base in Morocco will then lose its importance. Not only that, according to Western news agencies, Eisenhower also negotiated with the governments of Italy, Turkey, Spain, and other countries on the issue of setting up new US missile bases.

　　Particularly incompatible with Eisenhower's peace talks during his overseas visit were the diplomatic activities of the United States in Paris. There, from December 15 to December 17, a meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council was held, chaired by US Secretary of State Herter. At this meeting, US officials and generals trotted out a full set of "Cold War" language and plans for preparing for "hot war." US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining rebuked other member states of the North Atlantic Group, especially France, for insufficient military expansion, urging them to accelerate the pace of war preparations. US Secretary of State Herter proposed that the group maintain "a strong military system" that must have the "deterrent power" to wage "large-scale wars" and the "sufficient flexibility" to wage "local wars"; and advocated military "integration," requiring "allies" to share more military expansion costs. US Secretary of Defense Gates also advocated strengthening "joint defense efforts" to resolve the issue of the United States establishing nuclear weapons bases in other member states. US General Norstad clamored to make the North Atlantic Group the "fourth nuclear force." These activities blatantly show that the United States is strengthening its control over its "allies," forcing them to continue to step up military expansion and war preparations, serving the United States' war policies and aggression plans.

　　Eisenhower arrived in Paris on December 18 to attend the summit of the four Western powers held there. The US propaganda machine compared Eisenhower's trip to Paris with the visit of US President Wilson to Europe forty years ago, believing that he would become an "idol of the people" like Wilson, able to issue orders to America's "allies." Eisenhower personally held talks with de Gaulle, which United Press International called a "showdown meeting," attempting to "persuade" de Gaulle to accept the US military plans for the North Atlantic Group, especially the military "integration" plan. Eisenhower's activities in Paris, even the British "Daily Telegraph" believed to be extremely contradictory to his peaceful posture. The newspaper said: "When the peace envoy arrives with an olive branch at what is effectively a Cold War council," it is naturally "very incompatible."

　　The summit of Western heads of state accepted the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an East-West summit, which is certainly a positive aspect of this meeting. Convening an East-West summit to resolve pressing issues in the current international situation is the consistent demand of the Soviet Union, socialist countries, and all peace-loving countries and people for a long time. The United States and some other Western countries have repeatedly obstructed and delayed the convening of this meeting. Now, because the peace proposals of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are increasingly popular, and because the situation in which the East wind prevails over the West wind in the balance of world power is becoming increasingly clear, Western countries finally cannot but accept the proposal to hold an East-West summit. This is an important victory for the forces of peace. People all over the world demand that this meeting be successful. But one cannot fail to notice that powerful groups in Western countries are continuing to set obstacles to the summit. US Secretary of State Herter said at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting: "Negotiations with the Soviet Union will be quite long-term." Moreover, the communique of the Western heads of state summit also reaffirmed the West's previous position on the Berlin issue, that is, attempting to maintain the existing abnormal situation in West Berlin and the occupation of foreign troops. This attitude of the West is clearly not conducive to the resolution of the Berlin issue at the East-West summit.

　　What is particularly alarming is that during Eisenhower's overseas visit, the United States' war preparations activities have not been relaxed but have intensified. The United States is actively implementing the five-year (1959-1963) plan for developing missile weapons. In order to accelerate the production of missiles, the US government has even reduced funding for some conventional armaments to increase spending in this area. The United States is not only concentrating its efforts on developing intercontinental missile weapons at home, but also striving to expand missile bases in foreign countries (including Italy, Turkey, Greece, Spain, and other countries visited by Eisenhower this time). At the same time, the United States is also actively strengthening military blocs in various regions. In this regard, Eisenhower even mentioned it in the communiques issued after his talks with the heads of government of Italy, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, Greece, and other countries. The Chinese people cannot help but pay special attention to the fact that in the Far East, the United States is actively piecing together the Northeast Asia military group, announcing that it will revise the Japan-US "Security Treaty" with Japan in January next year; insisting on refusing to withdraw troops from South Korea, turning South Korea into a base for atomic war. In Southeast Asia, the United States continues to carry out the conspiracy to interfere in Laos' internal affairs using the United Nations, attempting to abolish the Geneva Accords; at the same time, it is striving to strengthen its war preparations activities in South Vietnam to maintain the tense situation in Indochina. The United States has recently intensified its hostile activities against China. The US propaganda machine has recently focused on attacking People's China, cursing China as the "greatest danger in Asia" and the "main threat to world peace," and trying to alienate neutral countries from China. US government officials have repeatedly reaffirmed that the policy of hostility towards our country remains unchanged, and insist on occupying our territory Taiwan for a long time. US Pacific Army Commander White clamored in Taipei not long ago: "The Cold War in Asia has not relaxed," and openly threatened: "Hot war is not impossible."

　　The actual actions of the United States are like this, so how can people easily trust the "peace sincerity" of the US government and President Eisenhower himself? How can the people of all countries who are fighting for lasting world peace, disarmament, and the easing of international tensions relax their vigilance against the forces of war and the forces of aggression?

　　In any case, although the world's forces of war and aggression will continue to employ all kinds of conspiracies and tricks, the forces of peace have achieved greater and greater victories. As long as all peace-loving people in the world persist in unity, persist in vigilance, strive to consolidate the victories already won, and strive for new victories, the forces of peace will inevitably completely overwhelm the forces of war. There is no doubt about this.

### 在艾森豪威尔出国访问期间发生了什么

　　在艾森豪威尔出国访问期间发生了什么
    艾森豪威尔已经结束了他访问西欧、南亚和北非十一国之行。对于艾森豪威尔的这次旅行，人们曾经抱有种种希望，希望他将利用这个机会，对于缓和国际紧张局势有所贡献。这种希望是可以理解的，因为艾森豪威尔和美国的一些其他负责人士在最近期间曾经多次谈到美国政府关于和平、裁军和缓和国际局势的愿望，而艾森豪威尔本人也把他自己的这一次远行称作“和平和亲善的访问”。
    的确，艾森豪威尔在出国访问期间继续发表了一些关于和平的言论。他说“美国正在努力谋求和平”，美国愿意“用会议桌而不是用武力来解决国际争端”，美国“决心执行旨在减轻全世界军备负担的政策”，美国最深的愿望就是“建立一个一切国家都可以不受损害地、无所畏惧地在自由、正义和和平中享受繁荣的世界”。只要这些言论能够见之于美国的实际行动，那么，国际形势就确实可以得到改善，人们也就不能不用新的眼光来看待美国的政策了。
    但是人们不能不惊讶地注意到，艾森豪威尔访问中在谈论和平的同时，还用了更多的时间来谈论保持强大的军事实力，谈论加强军事集团。艾森豪威尔说西方必须“在军事上保持强大”，而且“发展和保持这种力量”；说“北大西洋联盟仍然是西方外交政策的基石”，美国决心“继续大力支持”东南亚军事集团和中东军事集团。他在这一方面说得这样多，以至美国的“纽约邮报”也不能不承认，艾森豪威尔的访问就“好像一位将军到前线去进行鼓励士气一样”。在美国总统访问的十一国中间，有美国军事基地的就占八个，而对于这八个国家，美国总统却没有作出任何暗示，表示美国将放弃或者减弱这些基地。唯一的例外或者是美国久已宣传要放弃在那里的军事基地的摩洛哥。但是尽管摩洛哥一直就要求解除法国殖民统治时期承担的义务，要求美国取消在那里的军事基地和撤退美国驻军，艾森豪威尔到了卡萨布兰卡，却仍然硬要摩洛哥同意让美国保持它的四个基地到1963年。这是因为在美国的备战计划中，到四年之后美国将大批生产导弹，在摩洛哥的空军基地到那时才失去它的重要性。不仅如此，据西方通讯社透露，艾森豪威尔还同意大利、土耳其、西班牙等国政府谈判了设置美国的新导弹基地问题。　　跟艾森豪威尔出国访问期间的和平谈论尤其不调和的，是美国在巴黎的外交活动。在那里，从12月15日到12月17日，举行了由美国国务卿赫脱主持的北大西洋集团理事会会议，这个会上，美国的官员们和将军们端出了全套“冷战”语言和准备“热战”的计划。美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁斥责北大西洋集团的其他成员国特别是法国扩军不力，要它们加速备战步伐。美国国务卿赫脱提出这个集团要保持“一项强大的军事体系”，它必须有进行“大规模战争”的“威慑力量”，又有进行“局部战争”的“充分灵活性”；并且主张实行军事“一体化”，要求“盟国”分担更多扩军费用。美国国防部长盖茨也鼓吹加强“联合防御努力”，解决美国在其他成员国建立核武器基地问题。美国将军诺斯塔德则叫嚷要使北大西洋集团成为“第四个核力量”。这一些活动露骨地表明，美国正在加强对它的“盟国”的控制，迫使它们继续加紧扩军备战，为美国的战争政策和侵略计划服务。
    艾森豪威尔在12月18日到达巴黎，出席在那里举行的西方四大国的首脑会议。美国的宣传机器把艾森豪威尔的这次到巴黎同四十年前的美国总统威尔逊访问欧洲相比拟，认为他会像威尔逊一样成为“人们的偶像”，可以对美国的“盟国”发号施令。艾森豪威尔就曾亲自和戴高乐进行了合众国际社称为“摊牌会议”的会谈，企图“说服”戴高乐接受美国关于北大西洋集团的军事计划，特别是军事“一体化”的计划。艾森豪威尔在巴黎的活动，连英国“每日电讯报”也认为同他的和平姿态极其矛盾。这家报纸说：“当和平使者戴着橄榄枝抵达实际上是一个冷战的理事会时”，自然是“很不调和”的。
    西方国家首脑的会议接受了苏联关于召开东西方最高级会议的建议，这当然是这次会议的一个积极方面。召开东西方最高级会议来解决当前国际局势中迫切的问题，是苏联、社会主义各国以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民长时期以来的一致的要求。美国和其他的一些西方国家曾经再三阻挠、拖延召开这一会议。现在，由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的和平主张日益深入人心，由于在世界力量对比方面东风压倒西风的形势日益明显，西方国家终于不能不接受举行东西方最高级会议的主张，这是和平力量的一个重要胜利。全世界人民都要求这个会议能够取得成功。但是人们也不能不注意到，西方国家的有势力集团正在继续设置对于最高级会议的障碍。美国国务卿赫脱就在北大西洋组织理事会会议上说：“同苏联进行的谈判将是相当长期的”。而且西方国家首脑会议的公报还重申了西方以前对柏林问题的立场，即企图维持西柏林现存的不正常局面和外国军队的占领状态。西方的这种态度显然是不利于东西方最高级会议对于柏林问题的解决的。
    尤其值得人们警惕的是，就在艾森豪威尔出国访问的这段期间，美国的备战活动不是放松而是更为加剧了。美国正在积极执行发展导弹武器的五年（1959—1963）计划。为了加速生产导弹，美国政府甚至减少一些常规军备的拨款来增加这方面的费用。美国不仅集中力量在国内发展洲际导弹武器，而且竭力扩展在外国（包括艾森豪威尔这次访问的意大利、土耳其、希腊、西班牙等国）的导弹基地。与此同时，美国还积极加强在各个地区的军事集团，在这方面，艾森豪威尔在与意大利、巴基斯坦、土耳其、伊朗、希腊等国政府首脑会谈后发表的公报中甚至也提到了。中国人民特别不能不注意的是，在远东，美国积极拼凑东北亚军事集团，宣布明年1月同日本修改日美“安全条约”；坚持拒绝从南朝鲜撤军，把南朝鲜变成为原子战争基地。在东南亚，美国继续进行利用联合国干涉老挝内政的阴谋，力图废弃日内瓦协议；同时竭力加强它在南越的备战活动，以保持印度支那的紧张局势。美国最近敌视中国的活动是更加加紧了。美国的宣传机器最近集中攻击人民中国，把中国咒骂为“亚洲的最大危险”、“世界和平的主要威胁”，竭力挑拨中立国家和中国的关系。美国的政府官员一再重申敌视我国的政策不变，硬要长期霸占我国领土台湾。美国太平洋陆军总司令怀特不久以前在台北叫嚣：“亚洲的冷战并未松弛”，而且公然恫吓：“热战并非不可能”。
    美国的实际行动是这样，那么，人们怎么能够轻易信任美国政府和艾森豪威尔总统本人的“和平诚意”呢？为世界持久和平、裁减军备、缓和国际紧张局势而奋斗的各国人民，怎么能够放松自己对于战争势力、侵略势力的警惕性呢？
    无论如何，尽管世界上的战争势力、侵略势力还将继续施展各种各样的阴谋诡计，和平的力量已经取得愈来愈大的胜利。只要全世界一切爱好和平的人们坚持团结，坚持警惕，努力巩固已经得到的胜利，努力争取新的胜利，和平的力量必将彻底压倒战争的力量，这是毫无疑问的。
