Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 14th: The Harbin No. 1 Construction Engineering Company had, by early December, overfulfilled its annual engineering completion plan by 3.3%. Engineering costs were reduced by 3.1% compared to the annual plan, labor productivity increased by 5.4% compared to the annual plan, all engineering quality reached excellent grade, major safety accidents were eliminated, and general accidents were also greatly reduced.

	This year, the company undertook more than 250,000 square meters of construction projects, the majority of which were industrial buildings. The engineering structures were complex, the technical requirements were high, and the construction period was short. However, because the company adhered to the principle of guaranteeing key projects and launching them in batches, concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles and vigorously carrying out rapid construction, many key projects have been completed and put into production or delivered for use ahead of schedule. In the construction of the No. 6 workshop of the Harbin Bearing Factory, the company's employees creatively applied the rapid construction method of simultaneous cross-operations up and down, inside and outside, construction and installation, and completed the workshop in only twenty days, which is four months faster than the general construction speed.

	Mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution is an important method for this company to achieve high-speed construction. The company's tasks this year are 15% more than last year, but the number of construction personnel has decreased by more than 40% compared to last year. At the beginning of the year, the company's Party committee put forward the approach of combining hard work and clever work, and mobilized employees to carry out technical innovation activities. Since the third quarter, it has further carried out a red flag competition campaign focusing on high quality, rapid speed, and low cost, with the promotion of large-scale rapid construction and focusing on completion as the center. High-efficiency counterpart competitions were carried out between the same businesses and the same types of work, pacesetter competitions were carried out between individuals, and handover competitions were carried out between completed projects. In the competition, employees focused on key production areas and vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, putting forward more than 89,000 rationalization proposals in the third quarter alone. They also promoted 149 kinds of advanced machinery and tools in all types of work throughout the company, realizing mechanized and semi-mechanized construction in nine types of work such as carpentry, rebar work, concrete, plumbing, and ventilation, greatly improving construction efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 14th: The Yunnan Internal Combustion Engine Factory has completed its annual national plan ahead of schedule. As of the 12th, the total output value plan was 115% of the annual plan, the output plan was 100% completed, the quality was 33% higher than the planned target, the variety plan was 100% completed, the cost was 11% lower than the plan, and labor productivity was 23% higher than the plan.

	This factory was put into production in September last year while simultaneously carrying out capital construction. At the beginning, the management system was extremely unsound and product quality was low. The design capacity for manufacturing the 2160 coal gas engine was 35 horsepower, but they could only reach 22 horsepower. The factory Party committee analyzed this situation and first mobilized all factory employees to break through the quality barrier. They adopted the form of big airing, big contending, big-character posters, and big debates to mobilize employees to expose many specific problems existing in quality, criticized the thinking of not paying attention to quality, and put forward many methods to solve quality problems, which played a decisive role in solving quality problems. In order to strengthen technical management, the leadership established a set of process regulations from casting to assembly based on the opinions put forward by the masses, improved the "three-check system" of mass self-inspection, mass mutual inspection, and professional personnel inspection, and insisted on implementing the principle of not processing unqualified blanks, not assembling unqualified parts, and not allowing unqualified products to leave the factory, finally reversing the situation of low product quality and making product quality rise sharply.

	All factory employees also vigorously carried out technical innovation in the competition to improve production efficiency. The casting workshop, which is the first step in the factory's production, had low efficiency due to many manual operations. As a result of the leadership going to the front line to vigorously carry out technical innovation, cleaning machines, cleaning shovels, etc. were installed in this workshop, making manual operations mechanized or semi-mechanized, breaking through this weak link. All factory employees put forward more than 1,500 innovation proposals in the fourth quarter, which made production rise sharply. By December 11, they had completed 120 coal gas engines, doubling the 60 units produced in the third quarter.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, December 14th: The Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory insisted on putting politics in command, vigorously carried out technical innovation, and completed this year's national production plan in an all-round way eighteen days ahead of schedule. Cotton yarn exceeded the plan by 0.82%, cotton cloth completed the plan, printing and dyeing exceeded the plan by 4.9%, the quality of yarn, cloth, and printing and dyeing all exceeded the planned targets, the total output value exceeded the plan by 14.53%, the cost was 4.51% lower than the plan, labor productivity was 20.3% higher than the plan, and profits turned over to the state exceeded the plan by 26.96%. In addition, this factory has also added more than a dozen new products this year, such as corduroy, which is loved by ethnic minorities.

	Since the beginning of this year, the Party committee of the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory has focused on weak links in light of the specific circumstances of each period, and has successively led all factory employees to carry out production increase and frugality competitions to improve product quality, save raw materials, and quickly spin, weave, and print and dye, and vigorously carry out technical innovation. From January to October, the factory employees put forward a total of more than 32,000 technical innovation proposals. The realization of a large number of innovative proposals has brought great economic benefits to the factory. The value of saving electricity, raw materials, etc., that can be calculated alone is more than one million yuan. Comparing the fourth quarter with the first quarter, each piece of yarn saved 11 kilograms of raw cotton, saved 14 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and each kilometer of cloth saved 1.93 kilograms of yarn.

	In the mass movement of vigorously carrying out technical innovation, the Party committee of the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory has always insisted on putting politics in command and putting ideology first. When solving major problems, Party and government leaders went to the front line, ate, lived, and labored with the workers in the workshop, solved problems in a timely manner, and fully played the role of Party leadership and organization.

    又一批企业提前完成年计划
    哈尔滨第一建筑公司
    据新华社哈尔滨14日电　哈尔滨市第一建筑工程公司到12月上旬，已经超额3.3％完成了全年工程竣工计划，工程成本比年计划降低3.1％，劳动生产率比年计划提高5.4％，工程质量全部达到优等，消灭了重大安全事故，一般事故也大为减少。
    这个公司今年承担了二十五万多平方米的建筑工程，绝大部分都是工业建筑，工程结构复杂，技术要求高，工期要求短。但是由于这个公司根据保证重点、分批上马的原则，集中优势兵力打歼灭战和大搞快速施工，很多重点工程都已提前竣工投入生产或交付使用。在建筑哈尔滨轴承厂六号厂房中，这个公司的职工创造性地运用上下、内外、建筑和安装同时交叉作业的快速施工方法，仅用二十天的时间就建成了这座厂房，比一般施工速度快四个月。
    发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命，是这个公司获得建设高速度的重要方法。这个公司今年承担的任务较去年多15％，但施工人员却比去年减少了40％多。年初，公司党委就针对这个情况，提出了苦干和巧干相结合的做法，发动职工开展技术革新活动。进入三季度以来，进一步开展了以优质、快速、低成本为内容，以推行大面积快速施工和狠抓竣工为中心的增产节约红旗竞赛运动。在同业务、同工种间开展了高效率对口赛，个人之间开展了标兵赛，在竣工房号之间开展了按号交工对手赛。在竞赛中，职工们围绕生产关键大闹技术革新与技术革命，仅三季度就提出合理化建议八万九千多条。他们还在全公司各工种中推广了一百四十九种先进机械和工具，使木工、钢筋工、混凝土、水暖、通风等九个工种实现了机械化和半机械化施工，大大提高了施工效率。云南内燃机厂
    新华社昆明14日电　云南内燃机厂提前全面完成了全年的国家计划。截至12日止，总产值计划完成全年计划115％，产量计划完成了100％，质量比计划指标提高了33％，品种计划完成了100％，成本比计划降低了11％，劳动生产率比计划提高了23％。
    这个厂是在去年9月边基建边生产的情况下投入生产的，开始的时候管理系统极不健全，产品质量低。制造二一六○型煤汽机设计能力是三十五马力，他们只能达到二十二马力。工厂党委分析了这一情况，首先发动全厂职工突破质量关。他们采用大鸣大放大字报大辩论的形式，发动职工揭发了不少质量上存在的具体问题，批判了不重视质量的思想，提出不少解决质量问题的办法，对解决质量问题起了决定性的作用。为了加强技术管理，领导上根据群众提出的意见，建立了一套从铸件到装配的工艺规程，健全了群众自己检验、群众互相检验、专业人员检验的“三检制度”，并且坚持贯彻了不合格的毛坯不加工，不合格的零件不装配，不合格的产品不出厂，终于扭转了产品质量不高的局面，使产品质量直线上升。
    全厂职工在竞赛中还大搞技术革新提高生产效率。全厂生产第一道关的铸工车间，由于手工操作工序多效率很低，领导亲临前线大闹技术革新的结果，在这个车间装上了清砂机、清铲机等，使手工操作机械化或半机械化，突破了这一薄弱环节。全厂职工在第四季度提出了革新建议一千五百多件，使生产急剧上升，到12月11日止，就完成了一百二十台煤汽机，比三季度生产的六十台翻了一番。新疆七一棉纺织厂
    据新华社乌鲁木齐14日电　新疆七一棉纺织厂坚持政治挂帅，大搞技术革新，提前十八天全面完成了今年的国家生产计划。计棉纱超额0.82％，棉布完成计划，印染超额4.9％，纱、布、印染质量都超过了计划指标，总产值超额14.53％，成本比计划降低4.51％，劳动生产率比计划提高20.3％，上缴利润超额26.96％。此外，这个工厂今年还新增加了少数民族人民喜爱的灯芯绒等十几种新产品。
    七一棉纺织厂党委从今年年初开始，就针对每个时期的具体情况，狠抓薄弱环节，先后领导全厂职工开展了提高产品质量、节约原料材料和快纺、快织、快印染的增产节约竞赛，大搞技术革新。从1月到10月，全厂职工提出的技术革新建议共有三万二千多件。大量革新建议的实现，使全厂收到了很大的经济效果。单是节约用电和原料材料等能够计算的价值就有一百多万元。以第四季度和第一季度比较，每件纱节省原棉十一公斤，节省用电十四度，每千米布节省用纱一点九三公斤。
    在大搞技术革新群众运动中，七一棉纺织厂党委一贯坚持政治挂帅，思想先行。在解决重大问题时，党政领导干部都亲临第一线，在车间里和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，及时解决问题，充分发挥了党的领导和组织作用。（附图片）
