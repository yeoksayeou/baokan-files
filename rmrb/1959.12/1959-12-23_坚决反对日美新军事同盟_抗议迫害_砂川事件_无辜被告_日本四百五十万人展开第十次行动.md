Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd, Tokyo Dispatch: Four and a half million Japanese workers and citizens launched the tenth nationwide unified action today in more than 700 locations across the country, opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and protesting the Supreme Court's unreasonable ruling on the "Sunagawa Incident."

The tenth nationwide unified action shows that the Japanese people's struggle against revising the "Security Treaty" is growing in scale and participation with each iteration.

United struggle organizations in various parts of Japan today led local people to hold rallies, workplace meetings, and demonstrations, and held negotiations with local governments on preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty," as well as carrying out various publicity activities. Hyogo Prefecture, Fukuoka Prefecture, and Kanazawa City held large-scale mass rallies, lantern parades, and signature campaigns.

The Japanese Communist Party held a mass rally in Tokyo against revising the "Security Treaty."

The National Council Against Revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" further studied the arrangements for the tenth nationwide unified action central rally to be held in Tokyo on December 24th at its executive meeting today, and decided to hold the third National Congress of the National Council on December 25th.

The movement to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," combined with the Japanese workers' struggle to improve their lives and defend their rights, has also strengthened and empowered these struggles. For two years, the Japanese government has refused to hold collective bargaining with the Postal Workers' Union on issues such as wage increases. However, in the face of the workers' persistent struggle, the authorities were finally forced to agree to hold collective bargaining with the union the day before the tenth unified action. At the same time, the Japanese coal miners' struggle for year-end bonuses is gaining victory.

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd, Tokyo Dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) decided on a plan for the spring struggle next year, centered on preventing the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," at a meeting of union secretaries-general held today.

The plan stipulates that when Kishi Nobusuke goes to the United States on January 16th next year and the US and Japanese governments sign the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" in Washington, the unions affiliated with "Sohyo" will successively hold rallies and workplace meetings throughout Japan, and send resolutions opposing the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" to US President Eisenhower.

The struggle plan also stipulates that a large-scale struggle will be launched in February and March next year to oppose the Diet's deliberation and approval of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" and the military budget, and during the nationwide unified action from mid-March to mid-April, affiliated unions will be mobilized to launch a strong struggle of strength.

In order to realize this spring struggle plan, "Sohyo" decided to establish a central joint struggle council on January 11th next year, and decided to use five regions, including Kanto, Kansai, northern Kyushu, Hokkaido, and Tokai, as strongholds for the struggle. (Attached picture)

    新华社22日讯　东京消息：四百五十万日本工人和市民今天在全国七百多个地方展开了第十次全国统一行动，反对岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”，并且抗议最高裁判所对“砂川事件”的无理判决。
    第十次全国统一行动表明，日本人民反对修改“安全条约”的斗争，规模一次比一次大，参加的人数一次比一次多。
    日本全国各地方的联合斗争组织今天领导当地人民举行了集会、工作场所大会和示威游行，并且同当地政府举行了关于阻止修改“安全条约”的谈判和进行了各种宣传活动。兵库县、福冈县和金泽市举行了大规模的群众集会、提灯游行和征集签名运动。
    日本共产党在东京举行了反对修改“安全条约”的群众大会。
    阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天在干事会会议上进一步研究了12月24日在东京举行第十次全国统一行动中央集会的部署，并且决定在12月25日举行国民会议第三次全国代表大会。
    阻止修改“安全条约”的运动同日本工人要求改善生活和维护工人权利的斗争相结合，也使这些斗争更加壮大，更加有力。日本政府两年来一直拒绝同邮政工人工会举行关于提高工资等问题的集体谈判。但是在工人的坚持斗争面前，终于在第十次统一行动前一天迫使当局同意同工会举行集体谈判。同时，日本煤矿工人要求发给年终津贴的斗争正在取得胜利。
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会在今天举行的各工会书记长会议上，决定了以阻止修改日美“安全条约”为中心的明年春季斗争计划。
    这项计划规定，“总评”所属各工会将在岸信介于明年1月16日前往美国和美日两国政府在华盛顿签署新的日美“安全条约”的时候，先后在日本全国各地举行集会和工作场所大会，并且要把反对修改日美“安全条约”的决议送交给美国总统艾森豪威尔。
    斗争计划还规定在明年2、3月间展开声势浩大的斗争，反对国会审议和批准新的日美“安全条约”和军事预算，并且在3月中旬到4月中旬的全国统一行动中，动员所属工会展开强有力的实力斗争。
    为了实现这项春季斗争计划，“总评”决定在明年1月11日成立中央共同斗争会议，并且决定以关东、关西、九州北部、北海道、东海等五个地区为斗争据点。（附图片）
