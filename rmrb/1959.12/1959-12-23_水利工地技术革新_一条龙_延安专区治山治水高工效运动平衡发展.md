Water Conservancy Construction Site Technological Innovation "One-Stop"
Yan'an Prefecture's Mountain and River Management Achieves High Efficiency and Balanced Development

    (This newspaper's report) The high-efficiency movement for mountain and river management in Yan'an Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, has entered a new stage.

    Yan'an Prefecture has significant tasks for water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation projects this winter and next year: expanding the irrigated area by 250,000 mu, preliminary treatment of 4,100 square kilometers for soil and water conservation, basic treatment of 9,000 square kilometers, and construction of 400,000 mu of level terraced fields. 90% of these projects must be completed this winter and spring. The Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China calculated that, including logistics, a total of 34.65 million workdays would be required. Even if the entire prefecture mobilized 70% of its labor force and worked hard for 150 days, there would still be a shortfall of over 13 million workdays. The Prefectural Committee decided to launch a high-efficiency movement throughout the area to accelerate project progress. After the Prefectural Committee held a high-efficiency construction site meeting at the Yanhui Canal construction site in Yan'an County in mid-November, a high-efficiency movement in which everyone contributed ideas and engaged in innovation everywhere immediately took shape throughout the prefecture.

    As the high-efficiency movement unfolded, the Prefectural Committee discovered during inspections that each construction site was only undertaking individual innovations, reforming tools for a single process, while the previous or subsequent processes remained manual. This prevented close coordination between upstream and downstream processes, hindering the full utilization of improved tools. In response to this situation, the Prefectural Committee proposed to all areas that the tool reform movement on water conservancy and soil and water conservation construction sites must be interconnected, with close integration between upstream and downstream processes, eliminating weak links, and organizing new balances. Thus, the high-efficiency movement in the entire prefecture developed in depth along a new "one-stop" direction. For example, at the Dianyuan Canal construction site in Yichuan County, the frozen and hard soil initially meant that one person could only excavate a little over one to two cubic meters of soil per day. The potential of the soil transport labor force could not be fully realized, leading to work stoppages. Later, they adopted large-scale blasting methods, with a single blast excavating thousands of cubic meters of soil. Manual carrying could not adapt to this new situation, and large amounts of earth piled up, necessitating technological reform in soil transport. Under the leadership of the construction site Party organization, the mechanization of soil transport was quickly achieved. As the transport capacity caught up, the next process – filling and compacting – remained manual, using wooden tampers, which hindered the overall improvement of efficiency. Consequently, the use of rollers for compacting emerged. In this way, the technological innovation movement on the construction site formed a "one-stop" situation. Each link of construction achieved relatively balanced progress, increasing overall efficiency by about tenfold. Similar situations have subsequently appeared on many construction sites throughout the prefecture.

    To further promote the "one-stop" high-efficiency movement, the prefecture established a tool reform technical research group, headed by Bai Zhiming, the first secretary of the Prefectural Committee. The task of this group is to inspect water conservancy and soil and water conservation construction sites throughout the prefecture, promptly discover, research, and summarize new achievements in the local technological innovation movement, and immediately promote them comprehensively. Each county also studies, finalizes, and promotes high-efficiency tools through various methods. At the same time, all localities have promptly and appropriately resolved new problems that have emerged since the high-efficiency movement began. For example, after implementing tool reforms, various localities immediately reorganized labor organizations according to the instructions of the Prefectural Committee, universally implementing assembly line operations and the "five fixings" (fixing tasks, fixing locations, fixing times, fixing personnel, fixing quality), making labor organizations more adaptable to the development of the high-efficiency movement.

    The "one-stop" high-efficiency movement has achieved significant results in Yan'an Prefecture. Statistics from December 11 show that the entire prefecture has created, reformed, and promoted more than 50 types of advanced tools, totaling over 70,000 pieces, generally increasing efficiency by one to five times. Especially since the adoption of large-scale blasting for loosening soil, efficiency has increased even faster, generally by tens of times; the highest being the Yichuan Dianyuan Canal construction site, where a single medium-sized blast loosened more than 4,300 cubic meters of soil, saving over 2,150 labor days and increasing efficiency by 134 times.

### 水利工地技术革新“一条龙”  延安专区治山治水高工效运动平衡发展

　　水利工地技术革新“一条龙”
    延安专区治山治水高工效运动平衡发展
    本报讯　陕西延安专区治山治水高工效运动已步入一个新的阶段。
    延安专区今冬和明年的水利建设和水土保持工程任务很大：扩大灌溉面积二十五万亩，水土保持初步治理四千一百平方公里，基本治理九千平方公里，修水平梯田四十万亩。这些工程今冬明春要完成90％。中共延安地委按任务计算了一下，连后勤工算在内，共需三千四百六十五万个工日，而全专区即使把70％的劳力摆上去，大干一百五十天，尚差一千三百多万个工日。地委决定在全区开展一个高工效运动，以加速工程进度。11月中旬，地委在延安县的延惠渠工地召开了高工效施工现场会议以后，一个人人出谋献计、处处大搞革新的高工效运动，立即在全专区形成。
    高工效运动开展起来了，地委在检查中发现，由于各个工地只是单项革新，改革了某一工序的工具，而上一工序或下一工序仍保持着手工操作，使上下工序之间不能紧密衔接，使改良工具不能充分发挥效用。针对这一情况，地委又向各地提出水利、水土保持工地的工具改革运动，必须一环套一环，上下工序紧密结合，消灭薄弱环节，组织新的平衡。这样，全专区的高工效运动，便沿着“一条龙”的新方向向纵深发展。像宜川县的淀原渠工地，原来因为地冻土硬，一人一天只能挖一方多到两方土，运土劳力的潜力不能得到更大发挥，以至产生窝工现象；后来，他们采用了大爆破的方法，一次爆破即可炸出上千方土，人力担挑，不能适应这一新的情况，大量土方堆积起来，这就需要运土方面改革技术。在工地党组织的领导下，很快实现了运土车子化。运输力量赶上了，而下一道工序——垫方夯实工作仍是人力木夯，这就妨碍着整个工效的提高。于是，又出现了打夯磙碾化。就这样，工地上的技术革新运动形成了“一条龙”的局面，施工的各个环节，都获得了相对平衡的进展，使整个工效提高十倍左右。类似情况，在全专区许多工地都已相继出现。
    为了进一步开展“一条龙”的高工效运动，专区成立了工具改革技术研究小组，由地委第一书记白志明同志挂帅。这个组的任务是，巡视全专区水利、水土保持工地，及时发现、研究、总结各地技术革新运动中新的成果，并立即全面推广。各县也通过各种方法研究、定型、推广高工效工具的工作。同时，各地对开展高工效运动以后出现的新问题也都作了及时适当的解决。像实行工具改革后，各地根据地委指示，立即对劳动组织作了整顿，普遍实行流水作业法，实行“五定”（定任务、定地点、定时间、定人员、定质量），使劳动组织更加适应高工效运动的发展。
    “一条龙”高工效运动，在延安专区已获得显著成果。到12月11日统计，全专区已创造、改制、推广各种先进工具五十多种、七万多件，工效一般提高一倍到五倍。特别是采用大爆破松土以来，工效提高得更快，一般都提高几十倍；最高的宜川淀原渠工地，一次中型爆破，即松土四千三百多方，可节约劳力两千一百五十多个，提高工效一百三十四倍。
