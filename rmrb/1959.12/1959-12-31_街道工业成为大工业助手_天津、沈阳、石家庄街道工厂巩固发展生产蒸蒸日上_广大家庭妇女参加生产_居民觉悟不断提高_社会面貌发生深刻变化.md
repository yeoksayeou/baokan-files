　　Street Industry Becomes Assistant to Large Industry
    Tianjin, Shenyang, and Shijiazhuang Street Factories Consolidate Development, Production Flourishes
    Broad Masses of Housewives Participate in Production; Residents' Awareness Continuously Improves; Profound Changes Take Place in the Social Landscape

    (Reported by this newspaper) Tianjin's street industry, born in the upsurge of the entire people running industry, has become an effective assistant to large industry in supporting industrial production and meeting the needs of people's lives through more than a year of development, rectification, and improvement, with production flourishing.

    Street industries began to appear in some neighborhoods in Tianjin last summer. At present, the city has 2,584 street production units, with a total of more than 114,000 people participating in production, of which more than 90% are housewives. These street industries include 35 trades, manufacturing more than 700 kinds of products. By the end of November, they had created an output value of more than 110 million yuan, completing this year's production plan one month ahead of schedule and exceeding it by 2.1%.

    Since their organization, these street factories have given full play to their characteristics of low investment, quick results, flexible management, and utilization of waste materials for production, effectively serving large industrial production. According to statistics, there are more than 300 units in the city's street industry undertaking the manufacturing of various parts, tools, and raw material processing for large factories, producing no less than 200 kinds of products. The "Liu Hulan" Smelting Plant in the Southwest Corner Street uses slag from large factories such as electrolytic copper plants as raw materials, and can smelt four tons of metals such as steel, lead, aluminum, and iron alloys every day, which are then supplied to large factories for use. Many street factories have established regular product processing relationships with nearby large factories, becoming satellite factories or satellite workshops of large factories. The casting factory in Zhongshanmen Street and the Shenzhuangzi Machinery Casting Factory cast more than 2 million parts such as gears, motor housings, large iron hooks for steel ladle, and trolley snap rings for more than 200 factories such as the Electrical Equipment Factory, Tianjin Steel Plant, and the Second Cotton Textile Factory every month. The radio processing factory in Hongshunli Street undertakes more than 20% of the processing procedures of the nearby radio factory, completing its plan ahead of schedule every month, with a qualification rate of 100%, and has been praised by the processing unit many times.

    In terms of meeting the needs of people's lives, street industry is increasingly becoming a production unit closely related to people's lives. When the weather just turned cold, street factories rushed to produce a large number of stoves, chimneys, iron dustpans, stove hooks, and cotton clothes, cotton hats, cotton shoes, gloves, etc.; when the market urgently needed small commodities, street factories worked overnight to produce daily necessities such as shoe eyelets, shoe buckles, hairpins, rice spoons, and kettles. Various small commodities to meet market needs are already the main products of the city's street industry. At present, there are more than 1,400 units producing clothing, knitwear, wooden furniture, stationery, and daily hardware, with more than 500 kinds of products. From August to October this year alone, more than 10,000 kilograms of shoe eyelets and 563,000 hats were produced, and the quality generally reached the standards required by the commercial sector. The housewives participating in production have promoted their characteristics of diligence and thrift, and made full use of scraps and waste materials to make inexpensive and good-quality small commodities.

    After street industry was established, profound changes have also taken place in the social landscape. The ethos of loving labor, loving state property, and unity and harmony has been further established, street residents' new qualities have continued to grow, and their political awareness has continued to improve. Among the more than 20,000 residents participating in production in Nankai District, 97% have participated in cultural studies, including more than 3,800 who have participated in political and technical studies at Red and Expert Schools, and more than 440 who have participated in Party class studies. Ninety-four people have honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party in one year. The economic lives of residents throughout the district have also undergone great changes. In the past, the district had to issue more than 200,000 yuan in living subsidies every month, but now no one receives them anymore, and a new atmosphere of active savings has emerged. By the end of November this year, the total amount of savings in the streets of the entire district reached more than 627,000 yuan.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The street-run industry in Shenyang is booming, and has now become a strong assistant to state-owned industry, further enriching the supply of commodities, and promoting the prosperity of the market and the development of industrial and agricultural production. At present, there are 586 street-run factories in the city, with 1,390 production workshops and 9,258 sets of various machinery and equipment. These factories produce more than 2,900 kinds of products. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the total output value will reach more than 175.5 million yuan, equivalent to eight times the total output value of Shenyang's local state-owned industry in 1949.

    The establishment and development of street industry has played a significant role in meeting the needs of people's lives and assisting large industrial production. Over the past year, street factories have produced large quantities of parts needed by large industries and daily necessities for the people, enabling large industries to concentrate their efforts on completing their production plans.

    (Reported by this newspaper) After rectification, consolidation, and improvement, the street industry in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, has become a new social productive force for the city's socialist construction. At present, the city has established 336 street factories. From January to November, the total output value reached more than 77.78 million yuan, an increase of more than six times compared with the total output value of the city's street industry in 1958.

    Shijiazhuang's street industry was established by the vast number of workers' families and urban residents in the mass movement of the whole party and people running industry last year. The city's street industry directly processes more than 430 kinds of products for large industries. In practice, it has become the "auxiliary workshop" and "satellite factory" of large factories, enabling large factories to concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in major production. In addition, street industry has also become an important source of labor for large industries. Since the beginning of this year, the city's street industry has transferred more than 5,000 workers to large industries.

    Shijiazhuang is a newly emerging industrial city that has developed since liberation. In the past, there was less production of daily-use industrial products. After the establishment of street industry, not only has the output of many daily-use industrial products increased several times, but also the variety of products has increased significantly. The city's street industry produces more than 1,500 kinds of daily-use products. Toothbrushes, thermos bottle shells, trouser hooks, collar hooks, dairy products, etc., which used to rely on other places, are now mainly produced by street industry to meet market needs.

　　街道工业成为大工业助手
    天津、沈阳、石家庄街道工厂巩固发展生产蒸蒸日上
    广大家庭妇女参加生产　居民觉悟不断提高　社会面貌发生深刻变化
    本报讯　在全民办工业的热潮中诞生的天津市街道工业，经过一年多的发展、整顿和提高，生产蒸蒸日上，在支援工业生产、满足人民生活需要方面，越来越成为大工业的得力助手。
    去年夏天，街道工业开始在天津市的一些里巷中出现。目前全市已拥有二千五百八十四个街道生产单位，参加生产的人数共有十一万四千多人，其中90％以上是家庭妇女。这些街道工业共包括三十五个行业，制造出七百多种产品，到11月底已创造了一亿一千多万元的产值，提前一个月并超额2.1％完成了今年的生产计划。
    这些街道工厂，从组织起来以后，便充分发挥了它们投资少、收效快、经营灵活、利用废料生产的特点，有效地为大工业生产服务。据统计，全市街道工业为大工厂承制各种配件、工具和原材料加工的就有三百多个单位，产品不下二百种，西南角街的“刘胡兰”冶炼厂以电解铜厂等大工厂的炉渣作原料，每天可炼出四吨钢、铅、铝、铁合金等金属，再供给大工厂使用。很多街道工厂和附近的大厂建立了经常的产品加工关系，成为大工厂的卫星厂或卫星车间。中山门街的铸件厂和沈庄子机械铸造厂，每月都为电工器材厂、天津钢厂、第二棉纺织厂等二百多个工厂铸造齿轮、电动机壳、钢水包的大铁勾、天车卡环等二百多万个部件。鸿顺里街的无线电加工厂，包揽了附近无线电厂20％以上的加工工序，每月都提前完成计划，合格率达到百分之百，多次受到加工单位的表扬。
    在满足人民生活需要方面，街道工业更日益成为与人民生活息息相关的生产单位。在天气刚刚变冷的时候，各街道工厂就赶制出大批的炉子、烟囱、铁簸箕、炉勾和棉衣、棉帽、棉鞋、手套等；市场上迫切需要小百货的时候，街道工厂就连夜赶制鞋眼、鞋扣、发卡、饭勺、水壶等生活用品。供应市场需要的各种小百货，已是全市街道工业的主要产品。目前生产服装、针织、木器家具、文教用品、日用五金等产品的共有一千四百多个单位，五百多种产品。只今年8至10月，生产的鞋眼就有一万多公斤，帽子五十六万三千顶，质量方面一般地都达到了商业部门要求的标准。参加生产的家庭妇女发扬了她们勤俭持家的特长，充分利用下脚料和废料制成物美价廉的小商品。
    街道办工业以后，社会面貌也起了深刻的变化，热爱劳动，热爱国家财产和团结和睦的风尚进一步树立起来，街道居民新品质不断成长，政治觉悟不断提高。南开区参加生产的两万多名居民，97％的人都参加了文化学习，其中还有三千八百多人参加了红专学校的政治、技术的学习，四百四十多人参加了党课学习，一年中有九十四人光荣地加入了中国共产党。全区居民的经济生活也有了很大的改变，这个区过去每月要发放二十多万元生活补助费，现在已没有人再领了，而呈现了踊跃储蓄的新风气。全区街道的储蓄到今年11月底存款总额达到六十二万七千多元。
    本报讯　沈阳市街道民办工业蓬勃发展，现已成为国营工业的有力助手，进一步充实了商品供应，促进了市场的繁荣和工农业生产的发展。现在，全市共有街道民办工厂五百八十六处，有生产车间一千三百九十个，各种机器设备九千二百五十八台。在这些工厂中，生产各种产品有二千九百多种，预计到年底时，总产值可达一亿七千五百多万元，相当于1949年沈阳地方国营工业总产值的八倍。
    街道工业的兴办和发展，在供应人民生活需要及辅助大工业生产方面发挥了很大的作用。一年来，街道工厂曾大批生产大工业所需要的部件和人民群众的日常生活用品，使大工业能够集中力量完成自己的生产计划。
    本报讯　河北省石家庄市街道工业经过整顿、巩固和提高，成为全市社会主义建设的一支新的社会生产力。目前，全市已办起了三百三十六个街道工厂，1至11月份，生产总值达七千七百八十多万元，比1958年全市街道工业生产总值增长六倍多。
    石家庄市的街道工业是在去年全党全民大办工业运动中，广大职工家属和城市居民兴办起来的。全市街道工业，直接为大工业加工生产的产品达四百三十多种。实际成了大工厂的“辅助车间”和“卫星工厂”，使大工厂能够集中精力搞好主要生产。此外，街道工业还成为大工业劳动力的重要来源之一。今年以来，全市街道工业共给大工业输送了五千多名工人。
    石家庄是解放后发展起来的一个新兴工业城市，过去日用工业品生产较少。街道工业办起来以后，不仅有许多日用工业品的产量成倍增长，而且生产的品种也增加了很多。全市街道工业生产的日用产品达一千五百多种。过去一向依靠外地的牙刷、暖水瓶外壳、裤钩、领钩、奶品等，现在主要由街道工业生产供应市场需要。（附图片）
