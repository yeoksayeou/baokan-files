Raising Pigs Must Also Be Politically Guided
The Party Branch of Qianjin Production Team in Zhujing Commune Leads Pig Raising Experience
Xu Shoukeng, Fang Xiang

In the suburbs of Shanghai, in Jinshan County's Zhujing Commune, the Qianjin Production Team is praised by everyone for raising a lot of pigs and raising them well. In the first eleven months of this year, the team has already raised 2,230 pigs, averaging 1.24 pigs per mu of land, more than double the number raised in the entire year of last year. With more pigs and more fertilizer, the team's average yield of rice per mu this year broke through the thousand-jin mark.

Why are the pigs raised so well and in such large numbers in this team? The main reason is that the Party branch has a firm grasp on ideological and political work and does it meticulously.

Unraveling Ideological Knots

This year in January, when the Qianjin Team had just begun to develop pig raising on a large scale, some cadres in the team had the idea of "emphasizing agriculture and de-emphasizing sideline occupations," and some cadres and commune members were still worried about losing money raising pigs.

Before communization, the Qianjin Production Team collectively raised very few pigs. Some cadres were afraid of managing pig raising and were not actively leading. When raising pigs in the past, there was a shortage of feed, so the production team sent people everywhere to buy it. Once, they even sent people to other provinces to purchase it, and the travel expenses alone cost more than 200 yuan. Some small teams transferred people who were not good at agricultural production to raise pigs. For example, the two feeders transferred to the breeding farm in the sixth team were both physically handicapped, and no one taught them how to raise pigs, so the pigs they raised were so thin that only the bones remained, resulting in a loss of more than 800 yuan. The masses were very dissatisfied, and the cadres were also somewhat discouraged.

The Qianjin Team's Party branch believed that underestimating sideline occupations and fearing losses were like two big stones in the middle of the road. If they were not removed, the road to raising more pigs would be impassable. Therefore, the branch convened a meeting of cadres above the level of small team leader to discuss why pig raising had lost money in the past. At the meeting, the branch secretary led everyone to recall their own incorrect views and practices on pig raising in the past. When the facts were laid out, everyone was shocked. At that time, some cadres transferred old and weak soldiers to be feeders. How could the pigs be raised well? And the "rich methods" were used for pig raising, so how could they not lose money? After serious criticism and self-criticism, the cadres' understanding was improved. The branch then convened a meeting of commune members to tell everyone the facts presented at the cadre meeting, explaining that it was not pig raising that lost money, but because of poor leadership that the pigs were not raised well and lost money. The branch also stated that it would strengthen pig raising leadership in the future, and at the same time explained to the commune members the significance of pig raising for supporting national construction, promoting agricultural production increase, and increasing commune members' income. Finally, the team proposed the goal of striving to raise pigs this year.

The branch's determination was warmly supported by the vast majority of commune members. Some people said, "Raising pigs is like steering a boat. With the branch at the helm, what is there to be afraid of!" "Pigs are treasures in the home, and manure is gold in the fields. Raising pigs can also support national construction, so we should raise more." The whole team was enthusiastic and discussed raising more pigs. However, some well-to-do middle peasants were saying strange things on the sidelines, saying, "Raising so many pigs, unless they are raised under the commune members' beds." "Where will the feed come from? Can pigs grow up eating rotten mud?" In response to these arguments, the branch put forward the propositions of "solving the pigpen problem through self-reliance" and "raising pigs mainly with green fodder," and organized commune members to discuss them. These discussion meetings became debates between two different ideas and different practices. The commune members cited many facts to show that grass could be used to fatten pigs. Some people even sent the old wood and bricks from their homes to the production team on the night of the discussion in preparation for building pig pens.

Educating with Living Facts

The work of developing pig raising had already begun, but some well-to-do middle peasants still doubted whether collective pig raising could be done well and whether feeding pigs mainly with green fodder could fatten them. The team's breeding farm had thirty-six of the thinnest pigs. Because of the careless breeding and management in the past, some had been raised for five or six months, but they only weighed about fifty jin. Some well-to-do middle peasants used these thirty-six pigs as examples to prove that their ideas were correct.

The branch believed that in order to consolidate the development of the pig raising industry, if these thirty-six pigs were fattened, the idea of developing collective breeding would take deeper root among the masses. The branch decided to do it themselves, mainly using green fodder to raise these pigs well, and use the living facts to educate the cadres and commune members.

The branch appointed Yao Linmei, a Party member and head of the breeding farm, to lead the raising of these pigs. The branch secretary also helped cut grass, cook pig food, and clean the pig pens. The amount of refined feed fed to the thirty-six pigs remained the same as originally stipulated, 300 jin of bran and distiller's grains per month, without increasing a penny or a tael. Their first step was to separate the thirty-six pigs according to size, fatness, and thinness, so that the thinnest and smallest pigs would not be unable to get pig food. The grass used to feed the pigs was chosen to be relatively tender. When there was no time to cut grass during the day, they would take a wind lamp to cut it at night. The grass was cut finely and cooked thoroughly. After the bran was boiled, it was simmered and softened in the pot. Originally, these pigs were fed three meals a day, but now an extra meal was added at night. Because of their wholehearted care, the thirty-six pigs changed their appearance in a month, with shiny hair and round, plump meat growing on their backs. This news quickly spread. At this time, the Party branch seized the opportunity to organize production small team leaders and old farmers to visit. Three months later, except for four of the thirty-six pigs that were kept to cultivate "satellite pigs," the rest had been sold one after another. The large ones weighed 135 jin, and the small ones also weighed 103 jin. Every time the pigs were sold, commune members would run to watch along the way. Those who originally thought that these pigs could not be raised big now said, "As long as you are diligent, don't be afraid of ugly feed."

After these thirty-six pigs were raised well and fattened, the collective pig farm was expanded, and some piglets were supplied to commune members for private raising.

The Qianjin Team's pig raising is based on collective breeding, with both public and private raising developing rapidly at the same time. Now, collectively raised pigs account for about 80%, and privately raised pigs account for about 20%.

Making Friends with Feeders

After the number of pigs increased greatly, the focus of the Party branch's work was placed on improving the feeders' sense of responsibility. The branch believed that pigs are raised by the feeders, and their conscientiousness and responsibility are key to raising pigs well. If the Party wants to lead the pig raising work well, it must first do a good job in the feeders' ideological work. Branch Secretary Cao Deming often went to the breeding farm to help the feeders feed the pigs, cook pig food, and cut grass, on the one hand to gain pig raising experience, and on the other hand to talk with the feeders, make friends, and improve their sense of honor in the pig raising cause.

When Branch Secretary, Breeding Farm Head, and old feeders Xu Shuqing and Chen Yuda talked, the feeders expressed their concerns. What they were worried about was "not raising the pigs well and being held accountable," and they felt that raising pigs was more arduous than agricultural production and worried about low income. The branch secretary and farm head cited the example of the thirty-six thinnest pigs being fattened, explaining that as long as they were conscientious and responsible, the pigs would definitely be raised well. They also explained the principle of "not forgetting pig raisers in the harvest," enhancing their sense of honor in the pig raising cause. The branch secretary and production team cadres made careful study of the feeders' labor remuneration issue, stipulating that the feeders' work points would be calculated according to the number of pigs raised, with more work earning more, generally exceeding agricultural labor by 10%-15%. The feeders' enthusiasm was even higher.

The feeders in the Qianjin Team's breeding farm are managed with divided pens and division of labor. The Party branch organizes the feeders to compare and check each other twice a month. The branch also organizes the feeders to help each other and learn from each other, so that everyone is motivated and strives to be the first.

This year, the Qianjin Production Team has supplied 816 meat pigs to Shanghai, and accumulated more than 40 dan of fertilizer per mu of land. The net income from selling meat pigs alone is an average of 33.6 yuan per household. With more pigs and more fertilizer, the team's average rice yield per mu this year was 1,082 jin, an increase of 32.6% over last year.

    养猪也要政治挂帅
    朱泾公社前进生产队党支部领导养猪经验
    徐寿铿　方向
    上海市郊金山县朱泾公社前进生产队猪养得多，养得好，人人称赞。这个队在今年头十一个月里已经养猪二千二百三十头，平均一亩地有一点二四头猪，比去年全年饲养的猪翻了一番还多。猪多肥多，这个队今年水稻平均亩产量闯过了千斤关。
    这个队的猪为什么养得又多又好？主要原因是党支部政治思想工作抓得紧、做得细致。
    解开思想疙瘩
    今年正月，前进队刚开始大量发展养猪的时候，队里有些干部有“重农业、轻副业”的思想，有些干部和社员还顾虑养猪赔本。
    公社化以前，前进生产队集体养的猪很少，有的干部怕管养猪，不去积极领导。前年养猪时，缺少饲料，生产队就派人到处去买，有一次还派人到外省去采购，车费就花去二百多元。有的小队把农业生产上不顶事的人调去养猪。如第六小队调到饲养场去的两个饲养员都是生理上有残迹的人，又没有人教他们养猪的办法，因此养的猪瘦得只剩副骨头，结果亏了八百多元。群众很有意见，干部也有些灰心丧气。
    前进队党支部认为轻视副业和怕亏本好比摆在路中央的两块大石头，不搬掉，多养猪这条路就走不通。支部因此召开了小队长以上干部会议，讨论过去养猪亏本是啥原因？会上支部书记领导大家回忆过去自己对养猪的不正确看法和做法。事实一摆开，大家都吃了一惊。当时有的干部把老兵弱将调去当饲养员，猪怎能养得好？养猪又采用了“富办法”，怎会不亏本？经过严肃的批评与自我批评，干部认识提高了。支部就召开社员大会，把干部会上摆出的事实讲给大家听，说明不是养猪亏本，而是因为没有很好领导，所以才养不好猪、亏了本。支部还表示今后一定要加强养猪领导，同时向社员讲清养猪对支援国家建设、促进农业增产和增加社员收入的意义。最后提出了今年养猪的奋斗目标。
    支部的决心得到广大社员的热烈拥护。有人说：“养猪好比撑船，有支部撑舵，那还用怕！”、“猪是家中宝，粪是田中金，养猪还能支援国家建设，应当多养。”全队热气腾腾，都议论多养猪的事。但是也有些富裕中农却在一旁说怪话。说什么“养这么多猪，除非养到社员床底下去。”“饲料哪里来？猪吃烂污泥能长大吗？”支部针对这些论调提出了：“猪棚自力更生解决”、“以青饲料为主养猪”的主张，组织社员讨论。这些讨论会就成为两种不同思想、不同做法的辩论会。社员们举出许多事实说明用草可以喂肥猪；有些人在讨论的当夜就把自己家里的旧木料和砖瓦送到生产队，准备修建猪棚。
  用活的事实教育
    发展养猪的事已经开始，但是有些富裕中农还怀疑集体养猪养不好、以青饲料为主喂猪喂不肥。队里饲养场有三十六头最瘦的猪，因为过去饲养管理不经心，有些已经养了五六个月，也只有五十来斤重。有的富裕中农就用这三十六头猪当例子，证明自己的想法正确。
    支部认为，要巩固发展养猪事业，如果这三十六头猪养肥，发展以集体饲养为主的思想就会在群众中更深地扎根。支部决定亲自动手，主要用青饲料把这些猪养好，用活的事实来教育干部和社员。
    支部指定饲养场场长党员姚林梅领导养这些猪。支部书记也帮助割草、烧猪食、打扫猪棚。三十六头猪喂的精料仍旧照原来规定，每月三百斤糠和糠糟，不增加一钱一两。他们第一步工作是，把三十六头猪按大小、胖瘦分棚隔开，免得最瘦、最小的猪吃不到猪食。喂猪的草拣比较嫩的。白天来不及割草，就在晚上带盏风灯去割。草切得细、烧得透。糠煮过以后又在锅里焖酥、焖软。原来这些猪一天喂三餐，现在晚上又增加一餐。因为全心全意的照料，一个月工夫，三十六头猪就变了样，头头毛发亮光，背上长起圆滚滚的肉。这件事很快被当做新闻传开了。党支部这时就趁势组织生产小队长、老农来参观。三个月以后，三十六头猪里除了四只留着培养“卫星猪”以外，都已先后出售，大的有一百三十五斤重，小的也有一百零三斤。每次卖猪，沿途都有社员跑来看。原来认为这些猪养不大的人，现在也说：“只要手脚勤，不怕饲料丑。”
    这三十六头猪养好、养肥以后，集体养猪场扩大了，同时把一部分猪苗供给社员私人去养。
    前进队养猪是以集体饲养为主，公养私养同时飞快发展的。现在，集体养的猪占到八成左右，私人养的占二成左右。
  和饲养员交朋友
    猪大量增加以后，党支部的工作重点就放在提高饲养员责任心这件事上。支部认为，猪是靠饲养员养的，他们认真负责，是养好猪的一个关键。党要领导好养猪的事，首先就要做好饲养员的思想工作。支部书记曹德明经常到饲养场去帮饲养员喂猪、烧猪食、切草，一面取得养猪经验，一面和饲养员谈心，交朋友，提高他们的养猪事业心。
    支部书记、饲养场场长和老饲养员徐树清、陈余达四个人谈心时，饲养员谈出他们的心事。他们担心的是“猪养不好，怕追究责任”，并且感到养猪比农业生产辛苦，顾虑收入低。支部书记和场长就举出原来饲养场最瘦的三十六头猪养肥的例子，说明只要认真负责，猪一定能养好。又讲明“丰收不忘养猪人”的道理，提高他们对养猪事业的光荣感。饲养员的劳动报酬问题，支部书记和生产队干部作了慎重的研究，规定饲养员的工分按养的猪只数计算，多劳多得，一般可以超过农业劳动的10％—15％。饲养员的积极性更高了。
    前进队饲养场的饲养员是分棚分工负责管理的。党支部每月组织饲养员互相评比检查两次。支部还组织饲养员互相帮助、相互学习。使人人奋发，个个争先。
    今年，前进生产队已供应上海市的肉猪八百一十六头，每亩地积肥四十多担。单是出售肉猪的纯收入平均每户就有三十三元六角。猪多肥多，全队今年水稻平均亩产一千零八十二斤，比去年增产32.6％。
