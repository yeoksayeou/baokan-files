    Shenyang Shirt Factory Achieves Extensive Mechanization
    Without Increasing Workers or Adding Equipment, Annual Shirt Production Can Increase by 100,000 Pieces
    The workers of the Shenyang Shirt Factory have vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, basically realizing "three-izations" (production mechanization, power electrification, and tooling of production processes) throughout the factory. Next year, without increasing personnel or equipment, they can increase shirt production by more than 100,000 pieces.
    The factory has a total of 140 sewing machines. In the past, workers had to constantly step on the machine boards with both feet. Now, they only need to lightly turn on the power switch, and the long row of sewing machines immediately starts spinning rapidly. In addition to this, electric shears have replaced manual cutting; button sewing machines and buttonhole machines have replaced manual buttonholing and button sewing. Even the collar turning, lining, and cutting processes are all mechanized. As a result, while ensuring quality, the total factory output has increased by 30%.
    When the Shenyang Shirt Factory began to vigorously engage in technical innovation, some people believed that the clothing industry could not produce any significant innovations, and that sewing workers did not understand metalwork and could not make machines. The leadership mobilized the workers to speak out, debate, and organized visits to other factories in the same industry to learn about new advanced experiences, which greatly stimulated the workers' creativity and enthusiasm. They said, "With the leadership of the Party, those who work with cloth dare to play with iron, and sewing workers can also become metalworkers."

### 沈阳衬衣厂大搞机械化  不增工人不添设备一年可增产衬衣十万件

    沈阳衬衣厂大搞机械化
    不增工人不添设备一年可增产衬衣十万件
    沈阳市衬衣厂职工大闹技术革新和技术革命，全厂生产基本上实现了“三化”（生产机械化、动力电气化、工序生产工具化）。明年在不增加人和设备的条件下，可以增产十万多件衬衣。
    这个厂共有一百四十台缝纫机。过去工人们两脚不停地踏着机板。现在只要轻轻地把电门一开，长长的一列缝纫机，立刻飞快地转动起来。除这以外，电剪已代替了手工裁剪；钉扣机、锁眼机代替了人力锁眼、钉扣。甚至于翻领、浆衬切衬等各道工序，全部是机械化操作。因而在保证质量的前提下，全厂总产量提高了30％。
    沈阳市衬衣厂开始大搞技术革新的时候，曾有人认为被服行业革新搞不出什么名堂来，缝衣工人不懂铁工活，没法作机器。领导上发动职工鸣放、辩论，并组织参观同行业工厂新的先进经验，大大激起了职工的创造性和积极性。他们说：“有党的领导，摆弄布的敢玩铁，缝衣工人也会做铁工。”
