Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 29th: The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang) have comprehensively exceeded this year's production plan. The annual output targets for steel, steel materials, and pig iron were completed sixteen days, thirty-nine days, and four days ahead of the state plan, respectively. At the same time, the targets for increased steel and steel materials, as proposed by An'gang workers to brother factories and mines across the country, have also been achieved ahead of schedule.

	A notable feature of An'gang workers' implementation of this year's production plan is the comprehensive completion of the state plan. In addition to major production enterprises such as steel, pig iron, steel materials, ore, and coke completing their plans ahead of schedule, auxiliary departments such as railway transportation, power supply, and mechanical processing also exceeded their plans. Besides the completion of the total output value and output plans, indicators such as product quality, cost reduction, and profit delivery to the state have also completed the state plan. Furthermore, dozens of new steel materials have been added, and nearly six thousand different specifications of steel materials have been produced. In this way, An'gang workers have comprehensively realized the requirements of "good iron, good steel, steel into materials, and diverse materials", achieving comprehensive blooming in quantity, speed, quality, and economy.

	This year, An'gang's growth in the absolute quantity and leap forward magnitude of steel, pig iron, and steel materials has surpassed the Great Leap Forward of 1958. This is the result of conscientiously implementing the Party's General Line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies. After opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously carrying out mass movements, the production potential of large enterprises has been fully exploited. The vast majority of the increased steel, pig iron, and steel materials throughout the year have been obtained through tapping production potential. At the same time, the large number of small blast furnaces and converters built last year and distributed in various factories and mines have also demonstrated their power this year. About 13% of the increased steel and 30% of the increased iron this year were produced by small furnaces.

	An'gang has consistently adhered to large-scale mass movements throughout the year. Especially in late August, encouraged by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of workers put forward the initiative to brother factories and mines across the country to increase production by 250,000 tons of steel and 400,000 tons of steel materials, setting off a new upsurge in the increase production and practice economy movement. Steel production showed a situation of exceeding each ten-day period and surpassing each month.

	This year's mass movement at An'gang has entered a new stage after the promotion and development of technical performance competitions. In May, workers at the Third Steel Plant created the experience of technical performance competitions, which was quickly promoted in various factories and mines. By October, technical performance competitions had evolved from decentralized performances to joint performances. In just a few months, more than 63,000 technical innovations emerged, more than 23,000 production bottlenecks were broken through, more than 143,000 new records were created, and tens of thousands of advanced individuals emerged. In this way, the production level was continuously pushed to new heights, enabling the vast majority of technical and economic indicators throughout the year to reach the highest level in history.

	An'gang's mass movement this year has been closely integrated with strengthening enterprise management. Various factories and mines have adopted methods such as combining leadership with the masses and combining thorough destruction with vigorous establishment. In June and July this year, they established more than one thousand new rules and regulations, revised and supplemented more than two thousand, and retained more than one thousand four hundred. Especially after the mass movement developed to a stage centered on technical performance competitions, various factories and mines promptly mobilized the masses to incorporate newly emerging major technical experiences into operating procedures, thereby generally improving the production technology level of the masses and steadily increasing production.

	The large-scale mass movement carried out by An'gang this year has also made the communist spirit of cooperation among the broad masses of workers unprecedentedly high, uniting all links of the joint enterprise into one rope. After the vigorous mass movement was launched, how to achieve close cooperation between all links became a key issue in exploiting the production potential of the joint enterprise. From the first quarter of this year, more than forty factories and mines of An'gang launched inter-factory cooperation competitions centered on iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling. Since October, joint technical performance competitions have been continuously carried out in various factories and mines, so that a new cooperative situation of actively cooperating with each other and creating conditions for each other has emerged in various factories and mines of An'gang. Production links were closely linked one after another, leaping forward link by link, thus resulting in a great leap forward in the entire production.

	An'gang's production this year has achieved a great leap forward with the support of the whole country, and in turn, has vigorously supported the great leap forward of the whole country. This year, An'gang's supply of steel materials to the country has not only exceeded any year in history in quantity, but has also increased in variety. At the same time, it has also transferred more than 4,300 leading cadres, technicians, and skilled workers to brother factories and mines.

	At present, leading cadres and workers of various factories and mines in An'gang are reviewing the preparation for next year's production, and at the same time, they will hold a grand technical drill in the last three days. They are full of confidence to welcome a good start next year, and push next year's production level to a higher peak.

	Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 29th: The First Tractor Plant has completed this year's national production plan ahead of schedule. By December 23rd, the total output value plan was completed by 138%, the output plan was completed by 120.2%, the Dongfanghong tractors produced were all qualified in quality, and the cost decreased month by month.

	After the factory officially started production on November 1st, the workers launched a movement to break through the design quota, determined to make production basically reach the design level within the year. The workers of the whole factory put forward tens of thousands of innovation proposals, which greatly improved production efficiency. By December 21st, the number of tractors assembled daily by the factory had broken through the design quota. (Attached picture)

　　群众运动充分发挥了大企业的生产潜力
　　鞍钢全面超额完成今年计划
　　胜利实现增产倡议，钢铁钢材增长的绝对量和跃进幅度都超过去年
　　第一拖拉机厂生产突破设计定额，今年计划提前完成
    据新华社鞍山29日电　鞍钢职工已经全面超额完成了今年的生产计划。钢、钢材和生铁年度产量指标的完成时间，分别比国家计划提前了十六天、三十九天和四天。同时，鞍钢职工向全国兄弟厂矿倡议的增产钢和钢材的指标，也提前胜利实现了。
    鞍钢职工今年执行生产计划的一个显著特色，是全面地完成国家计划。除开钢、生铁、钢材、矿石、焦炭等主要生产企业提前完成了计划之外，铁路运输、动力供应、机械加工等辅助部门也超额完成了计划；除开总产值、产量完成了计划之外，产品质量、降低成本、上缴利润等项指标，也都完成了国家计划，并且增加了几十种新钢材，生产了将近六千多种不同规格的钢材。这样，鞍钢职工就全面地实现了“铁要好铁、钢要好钢、钢要成材、材要多种”的要求，作到了多快好省全面开花。
    今年鞍钢在钢、生铁、钢材的绝对数量的增长和跃进幅度上，都超过了大跃进的1958年。这是认真地贯彻了党的总路线和一整套两条腿走路方针的结果。经过反右倾、鼓干劲和大搞群众运动，大企业的生产潜力得到充分发挥，全年增产的绝大部分钢、生铁、钢材，都是靠挖掘生产潜力得到的；同时去年兴建的分布在各厂矿的大批小高炉、转炉，今年也发挥了威力。今年比去年增产的钢铁数量中，有13％左右的钢和30％左右的铁是小炉子生产的。
    鞍钢今年自始至终都坚持大搞群众运动，特别是8月下旬，在党的八届八中全会伟大号召的鼓舞下，广大职工向全国兄弟厂矿提出了增产二十五万吨钢和四十万吨钢材的倡议，掀起了增产节约运动的新高潮，钢铁生产出现一旬超过一旬、一月高过一月的局面。
    今年鞍钢的群众运动在推广和发展了技术表演竞赛之后，跨上了新的阶段。5月间，第三炼钢厂职工创造了技术表演赛经验，接着在各厂矿迅速地推广，到10月份，技术表演赛更由分散表演发展到联合表演。在短短几个月内就出现技术革新六万三千多件，突破生产关键两万三千多个，创造新纪录十四万三千多次，出现先进人物数万名。这样，就把生产水平不断地推向新的高峰，使全年绝大部分技术经济指标都达到了历史上最高水平。
    鞍钢今年的群众运动同加强企业管理紧密结合起来。各厂矿采取领导和群众相结合、大破和大立相结合等办法，在今年6、7月间就建立了一千几百种新的规章制度，修改和补充了两千多种，保留了一千四百多种。特别是在群众运动发展到以技术表演赛为中心内容的阶段以后，各厂矿及时发动群众把新出现的重大技术经验纳入操作规程，从而使群众的生产技术水平普遍提高，生产稳步上升。
    鞍钢今年开展的声势浩大的群众运动，也使广大职工共产主义协作精神空前昂扬，把联合企业的各个环节拧成了一股绳。轰轰烈烈的群众运动开展起来之后，各个环节怎样做到紧密配合，就成了联合企业发挥生产潜力的一个关键问题。从今年第一季度起，鞍钢四十多个厂矿分别开展了以炼铁、炼钢和轧钢为中心的厂际协作竞赛；从10月份起，又连续开展了各厂矿联合技术表演竞赛，使鞍钢各厂矿出现了主动互相配合、互创条件的新的协作局面，使生产一环紧扣一环，环环跃进，从而出现了整个生产的大跃进。
    鞍钢今年生产在全国支援下获得了大跃进，反过来又有力地支援了全国的大跃进。今年鞍钢供应全国的钢材除开数量超过历史上任何一年以外，在品种方面也增加了很多。同时，还输送了四千三百多名领导干部、技术人员和技术工人给兄弟厂矿。
    目前，鞍钢各厂矿的领导干部和职工，在纷纷检阅明年生产准备情况的同时，还要在最后三天里举行一场技术大练兵。他们信心百倍地迎接明年开门红，要把明年的生产水平推向更高峰。
    据新华社洛阳29日电　第一拖拉机厂已提前全面完成今年国家生产计划。到12月23日，总产值计划完成138％，产量计划完成120.2％，出产的东方红拖拉机台台质量合格，成本逐月降低。
    这个厂11月1日正式投入生产以后，职工们开展了突破设计定额的运动，决心在年内使生产基本达到设计水平。全厂职工共提出了革新建议上万条，使生产效率大大提高。到12月21日，这个厂日装拖拉机的数量就突破了设计定额。（附图片）
