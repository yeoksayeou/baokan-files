　　Welcoming the New Year, Advancing Victoriously
    Xu Jianchun, National Agricultural Labor Model, Director of Xiyou People's Commune, Ye County, Shandong

    The great year of 1959 is about to victoriously conclude, and the new year is approaching. In the past year, our commune, like all fraternal communes across the country, under the banner of the Party's General Line, conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, overcame various natural disasters, and thus achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest with an average yield of 846 jin per mu of grain land (an increase of 36.2% compared to the 1958 yield of 621 jin per mu), exceeding the increased production targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. Currently, after reserving enough grain, seeds, feed, and reserves for all members, the amount of public grain and surplus grain sold to the state is more than 8.4 million jin.

    With the rapid development of agricultural production, commune-run industry is also growing rapidly. Over the past year, we have established a machinery factory, a chemical factory, a knitting factory, and a sugar refinery. Each production team also has its own iron and woodworking production group. Old farmers who did not even know what new-style farm tools looked like in the past have now become skilled workers. The entire commune not only manages minor tool repairs within the team and major repairs within the commune, but also manufactures some small and medium-sized agricultural machinery, such as crushers, electric motors, sweet potato slicers, and deep plows. Due to the gradual expansion of public accumulation in the commune and the strong support of national industrial production, the entire commune now possesses one combine harvester, one tractor, thirty-five gas engines, eleven diesel engines, five portable steam engines, fifty-one water pumps, seventeen threshers, thirty-seven machine grinders, eight corn threshers, one truck, and three motorized sailboats. With these equipments, the rapid realization of agricultural modernization is entirely possible. These facts make me more deeply aware that as long as we faithfully listen to the Party's words, resolutely follow the path of the People's Commune, and hold high the red banner of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, we can leap forward, leap forward, and continue to leap forward.

    The situation is very good this year, and the situation will be even better next year. We must continue to exert our energy and push industrial and agricultural production to a new climax next year. Our Xiyou People's Commune has initially planned to achieve a grain yield of 1,200 jin per mu next year, including 500 jin per mu of wheat; to develop the pig population to 60,000 (one pig per mu), 100,000 chickens, 50,000 rabbits, 2,000 sheep, an aquatic product income of 2 million yuan, and a commune-run industrial output value of 1.655 million yuan. In this way, the average grain possession per capita of all members will increase from 1,180 jin this year to 1,770 jin, and the average actual income of members can increase from about 80 yuan this year (excluding household sideline income) to about 130 yuan. Currently, in order to ensure the realization of this advanced indicator, all members are vigorously building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, and focusing on wheat field management, as well as comprehensively developing diversified economic winter production.

　　迎新年，乘胜前进
    全国农业劳动模范山东掖县西由人民公社主任  徐建春
    伟大的1959年就要胜利度过了，新的一年即将来临。在过去的一年中，我们公社和全国各兄弟公社一样，在党的总路线的旗帜下，认真执行农业“八字宪法”，战胜了各种自然灾害，从而取得了全社粮田平均亩产八百四十六斤的空前大丰收（比1958年的亩产六百二十一斤增产36.2％），提前八年超额完成了全国农业发展纲要所规定的增产指标。目前全体社员除了留足口粮、种子、饲料和储备以外，交售给国家的公粮和余粮就有八百四十多万斤。
    随着农业生产飞跃发展，社办工业也在迅速地成长着。一年来，我们办起了机械厂、化工厂、针织厂和制糖厂。各生产队也都有了自己的铁木业生产组。过去连新式农具是什么样也不知道的老庄户，现在有些已经成了技术工人。全社不但作到了工具小修不出队，大修不出社，而且还制造了一些中小型农业机械，如粉碎机、电动机、地瓜切片机和深耕犁等。由于公社公共积累逐步扩大和国家工业生产的大力支援，现在全社已置有联合收割机一部、拖拉机一部、煤气机三十五部、柴油机十一部、锅驼机五部、水泵五十一部、脱谷机十七部、机器磨三十七台、玉米脱粒机八部、载重汽车一辆、机帆船三艘。我们有了这些装备，尽快地实现农业现代化是完全可以做到的。这些事实使我更深刻地认识到，只要忠实地听党的话，坚决走人民公社的道路，高举总路线大跃进的红旗，就能够跃进，跃进，不断跃进。
    今年形势很好，明年形势更好。我们一定要继续鼓足干劲，把明年的工农业生产推向新的高潮。我们西由人民公社初步规划明年粮食亩产量要达到一千二百斤，其中小麦亩产五百斤；猪要发展到六万头（一亩一头），鸡十万只，兔五万只，羊两千只，水产收入二百万元，社办工业产值达到一百六十五万五千元。这样，我们全体社员每人平均粮食占有量，将由今年的一千一百八十斤提高到一千七百七十斤，社员的平均实际收入，可由今年的八十元（家庭副业收入在外），提高到一百三十元左右。目前，全体社员为了保证这个先进的指标实现，正在大力兴修水利、积肥和狠抓麦田管理，以及全面开展多种经济的冬季生产。（附图片）
