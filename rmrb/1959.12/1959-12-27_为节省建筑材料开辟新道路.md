Opening New Roads to Save Building Materials
The Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of the Fifth Construction Engineering Company of Harbin
The Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of the Harbin Institute of Design

    The completion of the Harbin New Technology Experimental Building, like other new things, has been filled with the struggle between advanced and backward ideas, and between promoters and obstructers, from beginning to end. At the beginning of the building's conception, some people lacked confidence, saying that they had never heard of building houses with fly ash, so they thought it could not be done. When the ball mill equipment for preparing materials failed to crush shale and pumice, some people began to waver, wanting to change the building's three units into two or one, or even into a single-story house. But the activists and veteran workers were the opposite, they wanted to resolutely carry it through to the end. The provincial, municipal, and company Party committees resolutely supported these advanced ideas and constantly encouraged them to boldly innovate and create. With the encouragement and support of all parties, the workers established the confidence to win; so they improved the ball mill themselves, thus solving the problem that had been debated for more than a month. However, in the process of using fly ash as silicate testing, cracks, deformation, insufficient strength and other phenomena occurred many times, which could not guarantee the quality. At this time, some individuals doubted and wavered again about fly ash silicate, and some sarcastic remarks appeared, such as "If fly ash can build high-rise buildings, what do we need brick factories for!" After discovering these right-leaning conservative ideas, the Party committee immediately conducted a serious criticism, and pointed out to the trial workers that failure is the mother of success, and to experiment multiple times until success, and to be determined and not waver. Many workers continued to adhere to the trial production according to the instructions of the Party, and finally achieved final success.
    But after the building was completed, people with right-leaning ideas said again: "Even if it's built, I wouldn't live in it, what if it collapses and causes an accident!" But the workers who participated in the experiment and construction were the opposite. They said that if others don't live in it, we will, we have confidence in it. After the civil engineering was completed, they began to reform the heating equipment; after several days of experiments, all failed. A few people again produced the idea of "No matter what, the building is completed, we can deal with it with a native stove" and wanted to terminate the experiment. However, under the encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all the workers deeply opposed the right deviation, greatly boosted their energy, and set off a vigorous new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. All the workers of the company and the design institute reorganized their forces and continued the experiment, and finally succeeded. As many workers said, without opposing the right deviation, boosting energy, without the strong leadership of the Party, and without putting politics in command, it would be unimaginable to build the New Technology Experimental Building, and the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for achieving all victories.
    Vigorously carrying out mass movements and adhering to the experience of "two participations, one change, and three combinations" are important magic weapons for solving technical problems and breaking through production bottlenecks. In the entire trial construction process of the New Technology Experimental Building, the mass line and the experience of "two participations, one change, and three combinations" were implemented from beginning to end, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of all the workers, so that everyone used their brains, everyone offered suggestions, and problems were discovered and solved in a timely manner. However, in solving technical problems, many differences in understanding also arose due to different opinions. Technicians have a theoretical foundation and knowledge from books, but they lack experience in actual production struggles, so they are also prone to one-sidedness and limitations. For example, when the fly ash silicate experiment was successful and put into mass production, large pieces of it cracked, deformed, and had insufficient strength. The workers believed that it was due to uneven mixing ratio and insufficient gas supply; while the technicians believed that the workers were not careful in their operation and did not follow the operating procedures. In order to truly clarify the reason, the Party committee decided that everyone from the secretary, factory director to technicians would invest themselves in production, participate in labor, and find the reasons together with the workers. In fact, the workers were very serious in their attitude in the "rushing to the cutting edge" of creation. The cracks, deformation, and insufficient strength of the silicate large pieces were indeed caused by short mixing time, inaccurate mixing ratio, and excessive moisture during steam curing. This not only educated the technicians, but also further mastered the operating skills of the new technology in production. Facts have proved that new things or new technologies that appear are difficult to find in books. The workers are direct participants in production, the most practical, and the accumulated experience is also extremely rich. The experience and wisdom of the masses are infinite, so in the trial construction process of the New Technology Building, the task of solving each major technical issue was first handed over to the masses, and everyone was mobilized to discuss, concentrate the wisdom of the masses to solve it, and incorporate it into the main central content of workers' participation in management. Problems were discussed, suggestions were made, and difficulties were broken through every day through the form of pre-shift and post-shift meetings. Some veteran workers made as many as hundreds of rationalization proposals during the entire production process. The experience of "three combinations" once again exerted its great power in the creation process of this New Technology Experimental Building. In the entire production process, we held more than 100 "three combinations" meetings in response to countless major technical problems, so that many problems were readily solved.
    The successful creation of the New Technology Experimental Building is the crystallization of great communist collaboration. The New Technology Experimental Building is a composite of multiple technologies, so it is difficult for any one department to be competent alone. From the beginning of the proposal to the complete completion of the New Technology Experimental Building, the Harbin Institute of Design has always been closely integrated with the construction department. Not only did they exchange experience and jointly study plans in terms of design, but they also closely cooperated in the testing and construction of many important technologies. This solved the contradiction that the design could not keep up with the needs of the construction. At the same time, the construction of the New Technology Experimental Building also received strong support from six or seven departments, including Harbin Institute of Technology, the Academy of Sciences, and Heilongjiang Institute of Technology. They sent technical personnel to help with technical research, analysis and identification, and thus came to the final scientific conclusion. Therefore, the completion of the New Technology Building is a product of communist collaboration.
    The successful trial construction of the New Technology Experimental Building has further enhanced the confidence in carrying out technological innovation in construction. The relevant leaders in Harbin have decided to promote this new technology on a large scale. Some of the staff dormitories to be built next year will adopt this new technology and new materials.

    哈尔滨新技术试验楼的建成，也和其他新鲜事物一样，从始至终充满着先进思想和落后思想、促进派和促退派的斗争。在开始酝酿建筑时，就有些人信心不足，他们说从来就没听说用炉灰盖房子，因之就认为干不成。当备料中球磨设备磨不碎页岩和浮石时，有些人就开始动摇，要将这座建筑的三个单元改为两个或一个，甚至要改为小平房。但积极分子和老工人则相反，他们要坚决干到底。省、市委和公司党委坚决支持了这些先进思想，并不断地鼓励他们大胆地进行革新和创造。在各方面的鼓励支持下，职工们树立了必胜的信心；于是他们自己动手改进球磨机，从而解决了争论月余的难题。但在使用炉灰作矽酸盐的试验过程中，又多次发生了裂纹、变形、强度不够等现象，保证不了质量。这时，个别人又对炉灰矽酸盐发生了怀疑和动摇，随着就出现一些冷言冷语，说什么“炉灰能盖大楼还用砖厂干啥！”党委发现这些右倾保守思想之后，立即进行了严肃的批判，并向试制的职工指出，失败是成功之母，一次不成多次试验，直到成功为止，坚定信心决不动摇。许多职工根据党的指示，继续坚持试制，终于取得了最后成功。
    但在楼房建成后，有右倾思想的人又说：“盖成了给我住我也不住，塌下来出事故怎么办！”可是参加试验和建筑的工人们则相反。他们说别人不住我们住，我们心中有底。土建工程完毕之后，着手改革采暖设备；经过几天的试验，都失败了。少数人又产生了“不管怎样，楼房盖完了，用土炉子也可对付”的思想，想终止试验。但是在党的八届八中全会鼓舞下，全体职工深反右倾，大鼓干劲，掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约新高潮，公司和设计院全体职工，又重整旗鼓，继续试验，最后成功了。正如许多职工所说的，如果没有反右倾、鼓干劲，没有党的坚强的领导，没有政治挂帅，要想建成新技术试验楼是不可想像的，党的领导是取得一切胜利的根本保证。
    大搞群众运动和坚持“两参一改三结合”的经验，是解决技术问题、突破生产关键的重要法宝。在整个新技术试验楼的试建过程中，由始至终地贯彻了群众路线和“两参一改三结合”的经验，充分调动了全体职工的积极性和创造性，作到了人人动脑，人人献计，发现问题及时解决问题。但是在解决技术问题上，由于见解不同，也产生过许多认识上的分歧。技术人员有着理论基础和书本上的知识，但是，他们缺乏实际生产斗争的经验，因之也容易产生片面性和局限性。比如在炉灰矽酸盐试验成功大量投入生产时，大块发生了裂纹、变形、强度不够的现象，工人认为是配合比不均，供气不足的原因；而技术人员则认为，工人操作不细心，没有按操作规程干。为了切实弄清原因，党委决定，从书记、厂主任到技术员全部投入到生产中去，边参加劳动，边和工人一起找原因。事实上工人在“奔尖端”的创造中，态度是十分认真的。矽酸盐大块发生裂纹、变形、强度不够，确是搅拌时间短，配合比还不准，在蒸汽养生过程中产生水分过大等原因造成的。这不仅教育了技术人员，同时又进一步掌握了新技术在生产中的操作技巧。事实证明，新出现的新事物或新技术，在书本上是难以找到的。工人是生产中的直接参加者，最实际，所积累的经验也是极为丰富的。群众的经验和智慧是无穷的，因此在新技术楼的试建过程中，把解决每项重大技术课题，都首先交给群众，发动大家讨论，集中群众智慧加以解决，并把它纳入工人参加管理的主要中心内容。每天通过班前班后会的形式，讨论问题，提建议，突破难关。有的老工人在整个生产过程中提出的合理化建议达百条之多。“三结合”的经验，在这座新技术试验楼的创建过程中，又一次发挥了巨大威力。在整个生产过程中，我们针对无数次的重大技术难题，曾先后召开了百余次的“三结合”会议，从而使许多难题迎刃而解。
    新技术试验楼的创建成功，是伟大的共产主义大协作的结晶。新技术试验楼是多项技术的综合体，因此，无论是单靠那一个部门，都是难以胜任的。新技术试验楼从开始提出到全部建成，哈尔滨设计院始终是和施工部门紧密结合的。不仅从设计上作到了互相交流经验，共同研究方案，而且在很多重要技术的试验和施工上，也作到了紧密合作。从而解决了设计跟不上施工需要的矛盾。同时，新技术试验楼在建设中，也先后得到了哈尔滨工业大学、科学院、黑龙江工学院等六、七个部门的大力支持，他们派来了技术人员，从技术上帮助研究、化验分析和鉴定，从而得出了最后科学结论。因此，新技术楼的建成是共产主义大协作的产物。
    新技术试验楼的试建成功，进一步增强了在建筑方面进行技术革新的信心，哈尔滨有关领导方面已决定大面积地推广这一新技术。明年建设的职工宿舍，将有部分采用这种新技术、新材料。
