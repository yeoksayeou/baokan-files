　　Darwin and His "Origin of Species"
　　—Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of Darwin's Birth
　　Fang Zongxi
    In November 1859, England, during the rise of capitalism, published a world-renowned book – "On the Origin of Species." This masterpiece solved a fundamental problem in biology – the evolution of organisms. It was a potent bomb to the religious and theological camps, delivering a fatal blow to the religious, idealistic, and metaphysical worldview.

    Since ancient times, people have been interested in the natural world of life (the biological world). In the research, people have noticed the diversity of organisms and their adaptability to the environment. People have put forward various opinions on this, triggering fierce debates between metaphysical and evolutionary viewpoints. However, before the publication of "On the Origin of Species," various evolutionary viewpoints, including the evolutionary theory of the French scholar Lamarck (1744-1829), were crude and insufficient. During that period, idealistic metaphysical creationism, the immutability of species, and teleology dominated science. These theories advocated that various species in the world were separately created by God according to a certain purpose, and after creation, organisms would not undergo fundamental changes. Therefore, the diversity and wonderful adaptability of organisms were to show God's wisdom and omnipotence. Clearly, these fallacies were related to the relatively low level of science at that time, and also corresponded to the feudal aristocracy's longing for that static and unchanging social order.

    With the development of social productive forces, natural science also developed. In the historical development process, various departments of biological science, such as taxonomy, anatomy, embryology, paleontology, etc., also accumulated a lot of data, broadened people's horizons, and enriched people's knowledge, while also shaking the foundation of the metaphysical worldview. For example, the research of taxonomy, anatomy, and embryology has increasingly clarified that there are basically similar structures and embryonic development between various types of organisms. This similarity should be a sign of kinship (i.e., blood relationship) and evidence of a common origin. Paleontological research has increasingly clearly pointed out that the natural world of life is not immutable, but different with different geological eras, and some paleontological materials also show that organisms are gradually changing. These facts cannot be explained by creationism, the immutability of species, and teleology, as well as the theory of catastrophism proposed by the later French Cuvier (1769-1832). Therefore, an important task appeared in front of science: to summarize the materials accumulated by various departments of biology and give them a scientific explanation. Darwin's (1809-1882) book "On the Origin of Species" completed this task.

    Darwin graduated from the Faculty of Theology of Cambridge University in England in 1831 and was qualified to be a missionary. Needless to say, he was a believer in creationism, the immutability of species, and teleology at that time. From 1831 to 1836, due to some opportunity, he accompanied the British government's "Beagle" cruiser, which was sent to investigate world sea routes and colonial resources, to investigate the geology and biology of South America. He observed strata, excavated fossils, and collected animals and plants. In close contact with nature, his philosophical views gradually underwent fundamental changes. The vivid biological facts of the natural world inspired him, making him believe that species are not immutable but variable; various organisms are not separately created by God, are not without kinship, but are the product of long-term evolution. In this way, he transitioned from the idealistic, metaphysical viewpoints of creationism, the immutability of species, and teleology to the materialistic, dialectical viewpoints of evolutionism. After traveling around the world and returning to his country, he continued to collect materials related to biological evolution and diligently studied the principles of biological evolution for decades. In his research, he showed the demeanor of a progressive scholar: being realistic, learning with an open mind, and conducting extensive investigations. He finally completed the classic work that overthrew the old worldview – "On the Origin of Species" in 1859.

    The Main Content of Darwin's Theory

    The central idea of Darwin's theory is selection, including artificial selection, natural selection, and sexual selection. The theory of natural selection is the most important content of Darwin's theory, and it is further developed from the study of artificial selection. That is to say, before Darwin established the theory of how species evolve in nature, he first clarified the origin principle of varieties under domestic conditions.

    According to Darwin's research, domestic organisms (livestock and crops) originated from wild organisms. Humans have cultivated the diverse varieties we see today through long-term breeding from a few originally useful animals and plants. This process is called artificial selection. According to Darwin's research, organisms will undergo variations under the influence of the environment; organisms universally have many small variations, for example, no two individuals are exactly the same; most variations are hereditary; in the process of breeding organisms, humans often select those individuals with variations that are beneficial to humans (for example, larger bodies, stronger disease resistance, etc.) to pass on to future generations. After many generations, organisms accumulate variations beneficial to humans in a certain direction, finally forming useful and excellent varieties. Therefore, the basic elements of artificial selection are: variation, heredity, and human selection of variation. According to Darwin's research, humans can cultivate new varieties by using the small variations possessed by organisms and accumulating the effects of variations over many generations. He believed that there is a similar process in nature. He called the similar process that occurs in nature natural selection. The main points of the natural selection theory are as follows:

    1. Organisms have a tendency to over-reproduce. Animals and plants have huge reproductive power. The number of offspring they produce in each generation exceeds their parents by many times. However, under natural conditions, the number of individuals of each species remains largely stable over generations, indicating that most individuals of each generation are destroyed in the early stages.

    2. Struggle for existence. Since organisms produce far more offspring than can survive, individuals must compete for food and space, including the struggle between organisms and the inorganic world, interspecies struggle, and intraspecies struggle. Competition is the main content of the struggle for existence.

    3. Variation and natural selection. Organisms universally have a variety of small variations. Some variations are beneficial to survival, some variations are harmful to survival, and some variations are neither beneficial nor harmful to survival. In the process of the struggle for existence, those variations that are beneficial to survival are easily preserved and passed on to future generations, those variations that are harmful to survival are easily destroyed, and the preservation or destruction of those neutral variations is random. Darwin called the preservation of beneficial variations and the destruction of harmful variations natural selection or survival of the fittest.

    4. Inheritance of traits. The survivors of each generation (i.e., the victors) will pass on their traits (including beneficial variations) to future generations. Most individuals who are less adapted to survival die in the juvenile stage and cannot produce offspring.

    5. Continuous change. This is the inevitable result of natural selection. Due to natural selection, organisms will change over generations and may become more and more adapted to the environment. This is the origin of adaptation. However, because each generation produces too many individuals, and different individuals have different variations, and the struggle for existence occurs in each generation, and the surrounding environment is not immutable, complete adaptation is never achieved, and continuous change is inevitable.

    6. The formation of new species. This is also the result of natural selection. Due to the continuous changes caused by natural selection, not only will the descendants in the same area gradually become more and more different from the parent species, finally forming another species; but also the descendants facing different conditions will accumulate variations in different directions under different conditions, finally forming several different species. Darwin called the process of diverging traits from the parent species to produce new types in several directions trait divergence. According to his point of view, many different varieties of the same species, such as many varieties of domestic pigeons and many varieties of domestic chickens, show trait divergence; different species of the same genus, different genera of the same family, different families of the same order, etc., all show trait divergence, and are all products of natural selection. Due to the increasing complexity of living conditions, organisms will gradually improve their systems, and organisms will generally lead to upward development, transitioning from lower-level types to higher-level types.

    According to Darwin's opinion, the natural world of life is unified. The diversity, unity, and adaptability of organisms can be scientifically explained by the theory of natural selection. According to the theory of natural selection, the natural world of life has a common origin. In the beginning, there were one or a few of the most primitive ancestors, and in the historical development process, diversity was gradually produced through trait divergence. Since different organisms originated from a common ancestor, there is kinship between organisms. Since biological evolution is mainly achieved through natural selection, adaptation is the inevitable product of natural selection.

    In this way, the most basic life phenomena in nature have been given a unified scientific explanation, and the most basic and most difficult problem in biology – the origin and development of species – has been perfectly solved. Therefore, Engels wrote about Darwin's theory in "Dialectics of Nature": "No matter what changes this theory may have in some details, on the whole, it has now solved the problem in a way that is more satisfactory than ever."

    Darwin's Theory and Marxist Philosophy

    "On the Origin of Species" established a historical view in natural science with irrefutable facts, which overthrew the deadly enemy of dialectical materialism – the idealistic and metaphysical worldview, shattered teleology, and provided rich and reliable data for the development of dialectical materialism.

    According to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, the foundation of the entire universe and the entire natural world is matter, the activities of matter are governed by laws, the laws are objective, and they can be known. The natural world of life expounded by Darwin in "On the Origin of Species" is consistent with the material view of dialectical materialism. According to Darwin's point of view, the basis of life phenomena is not supernatural factors, there is no God in life phenomena; life is unified; the laws of life are objective and can be known, and he himself discovered the objective laws of biological evolution in his research.

    According to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, the entire universe and the entire natural world have a history, and they did not appear all at once in their present state. Matter is variable, and matter exists in motion, change, and development. The natural world of life expounded by Darwin in "On the Origin of Species" is consistent with the historical view of dialectical materialism. According to Darwin's point of view, the natural world of life has a long history, not just a few thousand years as said in the Christian Bible; organisms are variable; the natural world of life is not static, but is constantly renewed, and life exists in constant motion, change, and development.

    According to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, all things in the world are interconnected and mutually restricted, and they are constantly moving, changing, and developing in this state. The biological evolution expounded by Darwin in "On the Origin of Species" is exactly this situation. According to Darwin's point of view, organisms have complex and intricate connections with the surrounding environmental conditions (including inorganic conditions and organic conditions), and they are mutually restricted, and various contradictions often occur (this is the struggle for existence), which leads to the survival of the fittest and the elimination of the unfit (this is natural selection); this leads to changes in species.

    According to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, the process of development is a process from small quantitative changes to qualitative changes, and it is a process in which things transition from one qualitative state to another. Darwin expounded biological evolution in this way in "On the Origin of Species". According to Darwin's point of view, in the process of the struggle for existence and natural selection, organisms will gradually develop from one qualitative state (from old species) to other qualitative states (new species), and gradually transition from simple to complex, and from lower-level to higher-level. Darwin also discovered a mode of qualitative change – gradual qualitative change in this area of research. According to Darwin's opinion, gradual change (i.e., gradual qualitative change) is the main way of biological evolution.

    According to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, newborn things and newborn forces are invincible. Darwin pointed out in "On the Origin of Species" that the new species formed through natural selection, because they are more adapted to the environment, will inevitably defeat the old species in the struggle for existence and replace them. Many new species have broad development prospects.

    The principles put forward by Darwin's theory of natural selection can be regarded as the dialectics of the natural world of life, and they are the specific manifestations of dialectics in the natural world of life. Marx pointed out in a letter to Engels that Darwin's work "contains the natural scientific basis of our theory."

    However, Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" did not completely solve all the problems related to biological evolution, and "On the Origin of Species" also has shortcomings and errors. First, Darwin was not a conscious dialectical materialist. He only embarked on the scientific path of the theory of biological evolution due to the guidance of facts. The theoretical summary he made of the data on biological evolution made mistakes in some places, which is particularly evident in his argument that nature does not allow leaps, only smooth evolution. Second, he had no knowledge of the laws of social development, could not see the fundamental difference between animal evolution and human evolution, and mistakenly regarded Malthus's theory of population as a well-founded social law. Third, although he conducted research on heredity and variation, his research was insufficient. He neither understood the basic laws of heredity nor knew the mechanism of variation. Fourth, he had not conducted in-depth experimental research on the role of natural selection, nor had he specifically analyzed how variation changes the structure of populations under natural selection. Fifth, his analysis of the process of species formation was also insufficient, with very few specific materials. Now it seems that species formation has diversity.

    Of course, Darwin's shortcomings bear the characteristics of the times. After all, the level of science in Darwin's era was still limited, and genetics had not yet been established at that time. But these shortcomings cannot obscure the brilliance of "On the Origin of Species" in the slightest. How to develop Darwinism is the task of modern biology.

　　达尔文和他的“物种起源”
　　——纪念达尔文诞生一百五十周年
　　方宗熙
    1859年11月，处在资本主义上升时期的英国出版了一部举世闻名的书——“物种起源”。这部名著解决了生物学上的一个根本难题——生物的进化问题。它对宗教、对神学阵营是一颗烈性的炸弹，给予宗教的、唯心的、形而上学的世界观以致命的打击。
    从古以来，人们对生命自然界（生物界）就发生兴趣。在研究中人们就注意到生物的多样性和生物对于环境的适应性。人们就对此提出过种种不同的意见，发生过形而上学观点和进化观点的剧烈论战。但是在“物种起源”出版以前，各种进化观点，包括法国学者拉马克（1744—1829）的进化理论在内，都是粗糙的，不充分的。那个时期，在科学上占统治地位的是唯心的形而上学的特创论、物种不变论和目的论。这些理论主张，世界上各种物种是上帝按照一定目的分别创造的，创造出来以后，生物不会发生根本的变化。所以生物的多样性和美妙的适应性在于表现上帝的智慧和万能。很清楚，这些谬论是同当时比较低级的科学水平相联系，也是同当时封建贵族对那种静止不变的社会秩序的憧憬相适应的。
    随着社会生产力的发展，自然科学也发展起来。在历史发展进程中，生物科学各部门例如分类学、解剖学、胚胎学、古生物学等等，也累积了许多资料，开拓了人们的眼界，丰富了人们的知识，同时也动摇了形而上学世界观的基础。例如，分类学、解剖学和胚胎学的研究愈来愈清楚地阐明了各类生物之间有基本相似的结构和胚胎发育，这种相似应该是亲缘关系（即血统关系）的标志，是起源共同性的证据。古生物学研究愈来愈清楚地指明了，生命自然界并不是一成不变的，是随着地质年代的不同而不同的，而且还有某些古生物学材料表明生物是逐渐变化的。这些事实用特创论、物种不变论和目的论以及随后法国居维叶（1769—1832）所提出的激变论是不能解释的。于是在科学的面前就出现了一项重要的任务：总结生物学各部门所累积的材料，给以科学的解释。达尔文（1809—1882）的“物种起源”一书，完成了这项任务。
    达尔文1831年毕业于英国剑桥大学神学院，有资格去做传教士的。不消说，当时他是特创论、物种不变论和目的论的信徒。1831—1836年，由于某种机会，他随同英国政府派出调查世界航路和殖民地资源的“贝格尔”号巡洋舰去考察南美洲的地质和生物。他观察过地层，发掘过化石，采集过动物和植物。在跟大自然的紧密接触中，他的哲学观点逐渐发生了根本的变化。自然界生动的生物学事实启发了他，使他相信物种不是不变的，而是可变的；各种生物不是上帝分别创造的，不是彼此没有亲缘关系的，而是长期进化的产物。这样，他就由唯心的、形而上学的特创论、物种不变论和目的论的观点过渡到唯物的、辩证的进化论观点。他周游世界回国以后，继续不断地搜集有关生物进化的材料，孜孜不倦地研究生物进化的原理，几十年如一日。在研究中，他表现出进步学者的风度：实事求是，虚心学习，广泛调查。他终于在1859年完成了推翻旧世界观的经典著作——“物种起源”。
    达尔文学说的主要内容
    达尔文学说的中心思想是选择，包括人工选择、自然选择和性选择。自然选择学说是达尔文学说的最主要内容，它是从人工选择的研究中进一步发展而来的。这就是说，达尔文在建立物种在自然界里如何演变的理论以前，首先弄清楚了品种在家养条件下的起源原理。
    按照达尔文的研究，家养生物（家畜和作物），起源于野生的生物，人类从原来少数有用的动物和植物，通过长期的选种，才培育出现在所看到的多种多样的品种。这个过程叫做人工选择。按照达尔文的研究，生物在环境影响下会发生变异；生物普遍具有许多微小的变异，例如没有两个个体完全一样；变异大部分是遗传的；人类在繁育生物的过程中，经常挑选那些具有对人有利的变异（例如身体大些，抗病力强些等等）的个体传留给后代，这样经过许多代，生物就在一定方向累积了对人有利的变异，终于形成了有用的优良品种。所以人工选择的基本要素是：变异、遗传和人对变异的选择。按照达尔文的研究，人利用生物所具有的微小变异，经过许多世代对变异的累积作用，就可以培育出新品种。他认为在自然界里也有类似的过程。他把发生在自然界里的类似过程叫做自然选择。自然选择学说的主要论点如下：
    1、生物具有生殖过剩的倾向。动物和植物具有巨大的生殖力。它们每一代所产生的幼体数目比亲体超出了许多倍。可是在自然条件下每一物种的个体数目在累代中大抵保持稳定，这表明每一代的个体大多数在早期遭到毁灭。
    2、生存斗争。生物所产生的后代既然比所能存留的多得多，所以个体之间就必须为食物和空间进行竞争，包括生物跟无机界的斗争，种间斗争和种内斗争。竞争是生存斗争的主要内容。
    3、变异和自然选择。生物普遍具有多种的微小变异，有些变异对生存有利，有些变异对生存有害，有些变异对生存无利也无害。在生存斗争的过程中，那些对生存有利的变异容易得到保存，并传留后代，那些对生存有害的变异容易得到毁灭，那些中性的变异得到保存或毁灭则是随机的。达尔文把有利变异的保存和有害变异的毁灭叫做自然选择或最适者生存。
    4、性状的遗传。每一代的存留者（即胜利者）会把自己的性状（包括有利的变异）传给后代。比较不适于生存的个体，大多数在幼体时期死亡，不能产生后代。
    5、连续的变化。这是自然选择的必然结果。由于自然选择，生物会在累代中发生变化，并可能愈来愈适应于环境。这就是适应的起源。可是因为每一代都产生过多的个体，而且不同的个体有不同的变异，生存斗争又每一代发生，周围的环境又不是一成不变，因此完全的适应永远达不到，而连续的变化是不可避免的。
    6、新物种的形成。这也是自然选择的结果。由于自然选择所引起的连续的变化，不仅同一地区的后代会逐渐跟亲物种愈来愈有所不同，终于形成另一物种；而且面对着不同条件的后代，也会在不同条件下累积不同方向的变异，终于形成若干不同的物种。达尔文把从亲物种产生出性状在若干方向发生分化终于形成新类型的过程叫做性状分歧。按照他的观点，同一物种的许多不同品种例如家鸽的许多品种、家鸡的许多品种表现性状分歧，同一属的不同物种、同一科的不同属、同一目的不同科等等都表现性状分歧，都是自然选择的产物。由于生活条件愈来愈复杂，生物会逐渐改进体制，生物会一般地导致向上发展，由低级类型过渡到高级类型。
    按照达尔文的意见，生命自然界是统一的。生物的多样性、统一性和适应性都可以从自然选择学说得到科学的说明。按照自然选择学说看来，生命自然界有共同的起源。起初是一个或少数几个最原始的祖先，在历史发展过程中，通过性状分歧，就逐渐产生出多样性。由于不同的生物起源于共同的祖先，因此生物之间有亲缘关系。由于生物进化主要是通过自然选择而实现的，因此适应是自然选择的必然产物。
    这样，自然界里的最基本的生命现象就得到了统一的科学的解释，生物学上最基本的最困难的问题——物种的起源和发展问题，就得到了完满的解答。所以恩格斯在“自然辩证法”里对达尔文学说这样写着：“不管这个学说在一些细节上还会有什么改变，但是整个讲来，它现在已经把问题解答得令人再满意没有了。”
    达尔文学说与马克思主义哲学
    “物种起源”以无可辩驳的事实在自然科学上建立了历史观，这就在那里推翻了辩证唯物主义的死敌——唯心的和形而上学的世界观，粉碎了目的论，为辩证唯物主义的发展提供了丰富的可靠的资料。
    按照辩证唯物主义的观点，整个宇宙、整个自然界的基础是物质，物质的活动是有规律的，规律是客观存在的，是可以认知的。达尔文在“物种起源”里所阐明的生命自然界，跟辩证唯物主义的物质观是一致的。按照达尔文的观点，生命现象的基础不是超自然的因素，在生命现象里没有上帝；生命是统一的；生命规律是客观存在的，是可以认知的，他自己就在研究中发现了生物进化的客观规律。
    按照辩证唯物主义的观点，整个宇宙，整个自然界是有历史的，不是以现成的状态一下子出现的，物质是可变的，物质存在于运动、变化和发展中。达尔文在“物种起源”里所阐明的生命自然界，同辩证唯物主义的历史观是一致的。按照达尔文的观点，生命自然界有很长的历史，并不是像基督教圣经所说的只有几千年的历史；生物是可变的；生命自然界不是静止的，而是在不断地更新，生命存在于不断的运动、变化和发展中。
    按照辩证唯物主义的观点，世界万物彼此相互联系、相互制约，并在这种状态中不断地运动、变化和发展。达尔文在“物种起源”里所阐明的生物进化，正是这种情况。按照达尔文的观点，生物跟周围的环境条件（包括无机条件和有机条件）有千丝万缕的复杂的联系，并且相互制约，经常发生种种的矛盾（这就是生存斗争），由此引起适者生存，不适者灭亡（这就是自然选择）；由此引起物种的变化。
    按照辩证唯物主义的观点，发展的过程是由细小的量变进到质变的过程，是事物由一种质态进到另一种质态的过程。达尔文在“物种起源”里正是这样阐明生物进化的。按照达尔文的观点，生物在生存斗争和自然选择的过程中，会由一种质态（由旧物种）逐渐发展成另一些质态（新物种），并且由简单逐渐过渡到复杂，由低级逐渐过渡到高级。达尔文并在这方面的研究中，发现了质变的一种方式——渐进式质变。按照达尔文的意见，渐变（即渐进式质变）是生物进化的主要途径。
    按照辩证唯物主义的观点，新生的事物、新生的力量是不可战胜的。达尔文在“物种起源”中指出，通过自然选择所形成的新物种，由于更加适应于环境，必然在生存斗争中战胜旧的物种，并取旧物种的位置而代之。许多新物种有广阔的发展前途。
    达尔文的自然选择学说所提出的诸原理，可以看作是生命自然界的辩证法，是辩证法在生命自然界的具体表现。马克思在给恩格斯的信里指出，达尔文的著作“包含我们的理论的自然科学的基础”。
    但是，达尔文的“物种起源”并没有完全解决有关生物进化的所有问题，“物种起源”也有缺点和错误。第一，达尔文不是自觉的辩证唯物主义者，他只是由于事实的引导而走上生物进化论的科学道路。他对生物进化资料所进行的理论总结在某些地方犯了错误，这特别表现在他关于自然界不容许飞跃，只有平滑的进化这一论点上。第二，他对于社会发展规律没有什么知识，也不能看到动物进化和人类进化的根本区别，又错误地把马尔萨斯人口论看做是有根据的社会规律。第三，他对于遗传和变异虽然进行了研究，但他的研究很不够，他既不了解遗传的基本规律，也不知道变异的机制。第四，他对于自然选择的作用也没有进行过深刻的实验性研究，也没有具体分析过变异在自然选择下如何改变种群结构的过程。第五，他对物种的形成过程的分析也不够，具体的材料很少。现在看来，物种形成具有多样性。
    当然，达尔文的这些缺点带着时代的特征。达尔文时代，科学水平究竟还有限，当时遗传学也还没有建立起来。但是这些缺点丝毫不能遮盖“物种起源”的光辉。如何发展达尔文主义是现代生物学的任务。
