    Sun Guo Creates Chute
    Seven Minutes to Load Thirty Tons of Round Steel

    Sun Guo, a loading and unloading worker at Tangshan Station of the Beijing Railway Bureau, created a chute for loading round steel on high platforms, increasing loading efficiency by more than 20 times.

    Since November, employees of the loading and unloading department of Tangshan Station, in order to increase labor productivity and get rid of heavy manual labor, have extensively carried out a technical innovation movement.

    Loading and unloading worker Sun Guo, based on the simple principle of "water flows downhill," with the support of the Party, and after continuous hard work and improvement, created a chute for loading round steel on high platforms. In the past, it took 160 to 180 minutes to load a truck of thirty tons of round steel. With this chute, it only takes seven minutes (one minute for preparation, six minutes for pure loading). The number of loading and unloading workers has also been reduced from fifteen to ten, achieving speed, savings, and safety. Everyone generally reflects, "Seven minutes to load thirty tons of round steel! We never dared to even think about it in the past. Not to mention loading the truck, it wouldn't even be enough time to set up the planks."

    Now, all the employees of the station are launching a surging wave of technical innovation and technical performance competitions. (Ma Zhenqi)

    孙国创造滑溜器
    七分钟装三十吨元钢
    北京铁路局唐山站装卸工孙国，创造了高站台装元钢的滑溜器，提高装车效率二十多倍。
    11月份以来，唐山站装卸部门职工，为了提高劳动生产率，摆脱笨重的体力劳动，广泛开展了技术革新运动。
    装卸工孙国，根据“水往低处流”的简单道理，在党的支持下，经过了不断的苦钻和改进，创造出高站台装元钢的滑溜器。过去装一车三十吨元钢，用一百六十分到一百八十分钟的时间。用这种滑溜器，只用七分钟（准备工作一分，纯装六分）就可以了。装卸工人也由十五人减少到十人，达到了既快，又省，又安全。大家普遍反映说：“七分钟装三十吨元钢！过去连想都不敢想，别说是装车，就是搭搭跳板也不够用。”
    现在全站职工正波涛汹涌地掀起了技术革新和技术表演赛的浪潮。　（马振起）
