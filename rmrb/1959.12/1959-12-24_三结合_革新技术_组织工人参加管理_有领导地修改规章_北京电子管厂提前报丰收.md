Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: The Beijing Electron Tube Factory has comprehensively fulfilled this year's national plan ahead of schedule, and has accumulated experience in carrying out mass movements under the centralized leadership of the Party, providing a strong guarantee for continued leaps forward next year.

The factory has achieved excellent results in all production targets this year: the total output value plan was completed 43 days ahead of schedule, the output, variety, and labor productivity plans were completed 28 days ahead of schedule, the cost was reduced by 21% compared with the plan, the finished product rate was increased by 3% compared with the plan, safe production was achieved throughout the year, and all products ordered by other factories were delivered 25 days ahead of schedule.

The main content of the factory's large-scale mass movement is: under the premise of strengthening Party leadership and adhering to putting politics in command, mobilizing employees to vigorously carry out technological innovation; organizing workers to participate in enterprise management; and, based on summarizing the experience of mass movements, abolishing and revising some unreasonable rules and regulations and establishing some new rules and regulations suitable for production development.

When the factory first mobilized employees to carry out the technical innovation movement, it encountered opposition from some technical personnel. They believed that there was no need for a modern factory like an electron tube factory to engage in technical innovation; even if it were to be carried out, it could only be tested successfully by technical personnel in the laboratory before being promoted to the masses, and the worker masses could not have any creation or innovation. Under the leadership of the factory Party committee, the workers refuted this erroneous argument with their own practical actions. They carried out a series of innovations in design, processing technology, operation methods, and improving equipment efficiency, which greatly reduced the proportion of manual operations in the factory's production. After the factory Party committee used these facts to educate them, many technical personnel also participated in the mass technical innovation movement. A new upsurge of "three-combination" technical innovation of leading cadres, technical personnel, and worker masses quickly emerged throughout the factory. For example, leading cadres of the metal parts workshop of the tool parts branch factory found that the efficiency of automatic bending machines was low, and the metal parts produced could not meet the needs of the assembly workshop, so they proposed to study with technical personnel and workers, and jointly formulated a plan for innovating the automatic bending machine, with the technician responsible for design, the worker responsible for processing parts, and the workshop leading cadres responsible for contacting relevant parties. All eight bending machines were successfully transformed, which increased the output of processed parts by more than one time, meeting the needs of the assembly workshop. Now some workshops in this factory have transformed the original "three-combination" temporary research group into a fixed "three-combination" technical innovation committee or core group, establishing a more suitable organizational form for the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

All production group workers in this factory now participate in management, and more than 90% of the groups have implemented team economic accounting. Each production group in the factory generally has "eight members": economic accountant, quality inspector, material clerk, quota clerk, attendance clerk, tool clerk, process clerk, and technical safety and health worker. Their scope of work is limited to the group, and the workload is not large. After being skilled, each person generally only needs to spend more than ten minutes of spare time each day to get things done.

The result of workers' participation in management has further mobilized the enthusiasm of the workers: First, it strengthened the thinking of being masters of their own affairs. Workers consciously care about the production of the group and abide by rules and regulations and process discipline. Second, management work is clear, specific, detailed, and more in line with reality. Third, it saves management personnel. In the past, a workshop with more than ten staff members and technicians now has only three staff members and four technicians. Fourth, it has exercised the management ability of workers and found a way to train enterprise management cadres. Now, more than 2,400 workers in this factory have served as group administrators and group leaders, and some have been promoted to full-time management cadres in the workshop, and they are working very well.

In addition to participating in group management work, workers also participate in the management work of the entire factory through the factory's employee representative assembly.

In the mass technical innovation, technical revolution, and participation in enterprise management movements, based on the needs of production development, this factory also, on the basis of summarizing mass movements, led the abolition, revision, and establishment of rules and regulations by category. Before abolishing, revising, and establishing rules and regulations, they were all tested and proved to be feasible before being determined. Some production management systems are delegated to the workshops and groups, while the relevant product inspection standards and systems to ensure the cooperation of various departments are all controlled by the factory headquarters. In this way, there is both centralized leadership, ensuring the necessary production order; and creating convenient conditions for the development of mass movements, ensuring the continuous leap forward of production.

### “三结合”革新技术　组织工人参加管理　有领导地修改规章  北京电子管厂提前报丰收

　　“三结合”革新技术　组织工人参加管理　有领导地修改规章
    北京电子管厂提前报丰收
    据新华社23日讯　北京电子管厂提前全面完成今年的国家计划，并且积累了在党的集中领导下大搞群众运动的经验，为明年继续跃进提供了有力的保证。
    这个厂今年各项生产指标都完成得很好：总产值计划提前四十三天完成，产品的产量、品种和劳动生产率计划提前二十八天完成，成本比计划降低21％，成品率比计划提高3％，全年做到安全生产，外厂订制产品提前二十五天全部交货。
    这个工厂大搞群众运动的主要内容是：在加强党的领导坚持政治挂帅的前提下，发动职工大力进行革新技术；组织工人参加企业管理；在总结群众运动经验的基础上破除修改一部分不合理的规章制度，建立一些适合生产发展的新的规章制度。
    这个厂在开始发动职工开展技术革新运动时，曾遇到一部分技术人员的反对。他们认为像电子管厂这样的现代化工厂，没有必要再搞技术革新；即使要搞，也只能先由技术人员在试验室里试验成功以后，再拿到群众中去推广，工人群众不可能有什么创造和革新。在工厂党委领导下，工人用自己的实际行动驳倒了这种错误的论点，他们从设计、加工工艺、操作方法，提高设备效率等方面，进行了一系列的革新，使全厂生产中的手工操作比重大大减少。很多技术人员经过工厂党委用这些事实进行教育后，也纷纷参加到群众性的技术革新运动中来。全厂迅速出现了领导干部、技术人员和工人群众“三结合”的技术革新新高潮。例如工具零件分厂金属零件车间领导干部发现自动弯曲机效率低，生产的金属零件供不上装配车间的需要，就提出来和技术人员、工人一起研究，并且共同拟制出革新自动弯曲机的方案，由技术员负责设计，工人负责加工零件，车间领导干部负责与有关方面联系。八台弯曲机全部改装成功，使加工零件的产量提高了一倍多，满足了装配车间的需要。现在这个厂的一些车间已经把原来的“三结合”临时研究小组变为固定的“三结合”技术革新委员会或核心小组，为群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动建立了一种比较适宜的组织形式。
    这个厂现在所有的生产小组工人都参加了管理，并有90％以上的小组实行了班组经济核算。全厂每个生产小组内，一般都有“八员”：经济核算员、质量检查员、材料员、定额员、考勤员、工具员、工艺员、技术安全和卫生员。他们的工作范围只限于小组，工作量不大，在熟练以后，一般每人每天只要花十几分钟的业余时间，就能把事情办妥。
    工人们参加管理的结果，进一步调动了工人的积极性：第一，加强了当家作主的思想。工人们自觉地关心小组的生产，遵守规章制度和工艺纪律。第二，管理工作清清楚楚，具体细致，更加切合实际。第三，节省了管理人员。过去一个有十多名职员和技术员的车间，现在只有三名职员、四名技术员。第四，锻炼了工人的管理能力，为培训企业管理干部找到了一条途径。现在这个工厂已有二千四百多名工人担任了小组管理员和小组长，有些人已经提拔为车间的专职管理干部，他们工作得很好。
    除参加小组管理工作外，工人们还通过全厂职工代表大会参加全厂的管理工作。
    在群众性的技术革新、技术革命和参加企业管理的运动中，根据生产发展的需要，这个厂还在总结群众运动的基础上，有领导地分门别类破除、修改和建立了规章制度。在破除、修改和建立规章制度以前，都经过试验，证明切实可行以后再确定。有一部分生产管理制度下放给车间、小组掌握，有关产品检验标准和保证各部门协作的一些制度，则全部由厂部掌握。这样，既有集中领导，保证了必要的生产秩序；又为群众运动的发展创造了便利条件，保证了生产的不断跃进。
