    Individualism is the Source of All Evil
    Li Mancun

In the current struggle against right-leaning opportunism, a large number of facts prove that right-leaning opportunism is closely linked to bourgeois individualism. Therefore, to criticize right-leaning opportunism, we must dig up the roots of individualism; to criticize individualism, we must also elevate it to the height of opposing right-leaning thought and defending the Party's General Line.

Since the founding of our Party, we have been constantly fighting against all kinds of individualistic thinking within the Party. Why is it that even now some people fall into the quagmire of right-leaning opportunism because of individualism? The reason is that individualism has deep social roots; it is the product of class society and the private ownership system in history. It is the core of the ideological consciousness of all exploiting classes.

When private property ownership appeared for the first time in human history, with a minority of people possessing the means of social production and the labor products of the majority, there emerged exploiting classes who sought personal happiness by exploiting the labor of others, and exploited classes who lost their happiness by being exploited by others. Thus, a class society of man exploiting man, man oppressing man, and man eating man was formed. In order to maintain their private property system and exploitation system, the exploiting classes, in addition to adopting a series of exploitation and domination methods in the economic and political spheres, also developed a complete set of spiritual weapons serving the exploitation system in the ideological sphere, that is, the ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes. The core of all exploiting class ideological consciousness is individualism. Its essence is to build the happiness of a few on the basis of harming the happiness of the majority. In capitalist society, this self-serving, profit-seeking individualism developed to its peak, becoming a bourgeois ideological system, and possessing extremely hypocritical and deceptive qualities. This is bourgeois extreme individualism.

The class nature of the proletariat is a high degree of organization, discipline, and collectivist spirit. This is determined by its class status and the living environment associated with modern large-scale production. The highest and most concentrated expression of this organization, discipline, and collectivist spirit is the Party spirit of the Communist Party. However, not everyone in the ranks of the proletariat and the Communist Party fully possesses this proletarian nature and Party spirit; some comrades still retain individualistic ideas to varying degrees.

What is the reason for this? Generally speaking, there are two reasons.

The first reason is the influence and corrosion of external exploiting classes and other non-proletarian elements. In the period of socialist revolution and construction, classes have not yet been completely eliminated. The proletariat and the Communist Party always live in the same society as non-proletarian elements and maintain certain connections. On the one hand, the proletariat is constantly transforming and eliminating the bourgeoisie, which is the main trend and inevitable outcome of the struggle. But on the other hand, in the process of this struggle, the bourgeoisie is also using various forms to try to influence and corrupt the proletariat. Therefore, some wavering elements within the proletarian ranks often accept alien ideological consciousness under this influence and corrosion. The emergence of right-leaning opportunists is the result of this influence and corrosion.

The second reason is the impurity of internal elements. In capitalist society, the ranks of the proletariat are often supplemented by successively bankrupt small producers. Currently, the majority of our country's working class has just been absorbed from cooperativized farmers. The main component of our Party also comes from the basic masses of peasants, and a small number even come from exploiting-class families. Therefore, in their ideological consciousness, there will inevitably be more or less the brand of the original class. The majority of them have gradually eliminated the nature of the original class and have the class nature and Party spirit of the proletariat after undergoing production and war training and receiving education in Marxism-Leninism. However, there is also a small number of people who, for various reasons, still retain the ideological remnants of the original class, and some individuals have even remained completely unchanged.

Due to the above-mentioned internal and external reasons, it is not an incomprehensible oddity, but a completely understandable and logical phenomenon that there are still bourgeois individualism and other non-proletarian ideological remnants in the ranks of the proletariat and its vanguard—the Communist Party.

Bourgeois individualism is fundamentally opposed to proletarian collectivism, is incompatible with it, is a great enemy of the Party's unity, a great enemy of the proletarian cause, and is the source of all evil.

For every Communist Party member, regardless of his position or merits, as long as he retains or is infected with bourgeois individualistic ideas, he will inevitably have a progressive and revolutionary side, as well as a backward and even reactionary side. The process of struggle between this progressive and revolutionary side and the backward and reactionary side is the process of ideological transformation. In the process of ideological transformation, the progressiveness and revolutionariness of the majority of people will gradually develop; the backwardness and reactionariness will gradually weaken until they are completely overcome. However, there are also very few people who may do the opposite, their progressiveness and revolutionariness gradually weaken, while their backwardness and reactionariness greatly develop. Once bourgeois individualistic ideas occupy a dominant position in their minds, they will make various mistakes. Because bourgeois individualists must proceed from personal gains and losses, personal interests, and personal preferences when encountering anything, this will inevitably manifest itself as political opportunism, organizational exclusiveness, selfishness in life, and narrowness in ideological methods.

The so-called political opportunism means that the assessment of the political situation, the Party's line, policies, and revolutionary mass movements are not based on the fundamental interests of the proletariat, but on Marxist analysis and a positive and enthusiastic attitude; but often from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, from personal interests and personal preferences to estimate the revolutionary situation, understand the line and policies, and treat the mass movement. Therefore, at the critical juncture of the revolution, they often fear the class enemy, succumb to the pressure of the enemy, or fear temporary difficulties and fall into the quagmire of pessimistic and wavering right-leaning opportunism (this is the main thing at present); sometimes they may also underestimate the enemy, be overwhelmed by temporary victory and fall into the quagmire of blind action and adventurous "left"-leaning opportunism.

The so-called organizational exclusiveness means that in the relationship between Party members and Party members, individuals and organizations, this part of the organization and that part of the organization, and lower-level organizations and higher-level organizations, decisions on whether to welcome or exclude, support or resist, promote or suppress, unite or split are not made according to the principles of the Party, but according to their personal interests. In this way, they will inevitably love comrades to the point of wishing them alive and hate them to the point of wishing them dead; they will inevitably throw cadres into the abyss in anger and add them to their knees in joy; they will inevitably flatter and fawn on organizations and superiors that are compatible, and confront and resist those that are incompatible. In this way, he will inevitably commit the mistake of sectarianism and engage in independence, and even develop to the point of forming factions and engaging in anti-Party activities.

The so-called selfishness in life means that issues such as honor, status, and material treatment are not handled with the communist attitude of wholeheartedly serving the interests of the people, being honest and selfless, being upright and impartial, and enduring hardship before enjoying comfort, but pursuing personal interests, scrambling for fame and fortune, engaging in corruption and degeneration, striving for comfort, fearing hardship, and in serious cases, degenerating and deteriorating into criminal elements who violate laws and regulations.

The so-called narrowness in ideological methods means that individualism can make people blinded by profit, unwilling or afraid to face objective things squarely, and subjectively look at what they want to see and listen to what they want to hear according to the needs of personal interests and personal preferences; they turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to everything that does not suit their taste. Such an ideological method inevitably produces extreme subjectivity and one-sidedness. As a result, they are either prisoners of dogmatism or tools of empiricism.

In short, individualism is extremely harmful and can lead to personal ruin and damage the cause of the Party. There are many historical lessons, too many to list. Almost all the right-leaning opportunists who have been exposed have serious bourgeois individualistic ideas. This is by no means a coincidence, but the inevitable result of the serious development of individualism. Of course, this does not mean that a Communist Party member will not make other mistakes as long as he does not have individualistic ideas. But if he really does not have any individualistic ideas, then his chances of making major mistakes are always smaller. Even if he makes mistakes, because he has no personal gains and losses to worry about, it is faster and more thorough to correct them.

Our opposition to individualism does not negate all personal interests, let alone regard all reasonable personal demands as individualism; on the contrary, the Party has always been and only the Party can care about and properly handle the legitimate personal interests of Party members. For example, only the Party can give appropriate political and material treatment according to the size of a Party member's contribution to the Party and the people; only the Party can assign him a job that he can handle according to his personal talents; only the Party can systematically and organizationally cultivate and improve him according to his political, cultural, and professional level; only the Party can give him meticulous care according to his personal actual difficulties within the possible scope. However, the Party has always adhered to a principle in handling the personal interests of Party members, that is, the interests of the Party are above all else, personal interests must unconditionally obey the interests of the Party, and attention and care must be given to the personal interests of Party members under the principle of not violating the interests of the Party. Therefore, as far as individual Party members are concerned, any individualistic behavior that places personal interests above the interests of the Party or makes taking care of personal interests a condition for obeying the Party's decisions is not allowed.

    个人主义是万恶之源
    李曼村
    在目前反对右倾机会主义的斗争中，大量的事实证明：右倾机会主义与资产阶级个人主义是密切相联的；因此，批判右倾机会主义，一定要挖掉个人主义的根子，批判个人主义，也一定要提高到反对右倾思想和保卫党的总路线的高度。
    我们党从建党以来，就在党内不断地同形形色色的个人主义思想作斗争，为什么现在还会有人因为个人主义而堕落到右倾机会主义的泥坑里去呢？原因就在于个人主义有着深刻的社会根源，它是历史上阶级社会和私有制度的产物。是一切剥削阶级思想意识的核心。
    人类历史上第一次出现了私有财产制度，少数人占有社会生产资料，占有大多数人的劳动产品时，就出现了靠剥削别人劳动来谋取个人幸福的剥削阶级，和遭受别人剥削而丧失自己幸福的被剥削阶级。于是就形成了人剥削人、人压迫人、人吃人的阶级社会。剥削阶级为了维护其私有财产制度和剥削制度，除了在经济上、政治上采取一系列的剥削和统治办法外，在意识形态领域内，也发展了一整套为剥削制度服务的精神武器，即剥削阶级的思想意识。一切剥削阶级思想意识的核心，都是个人主义。它的实质是把少数人的幸福建立在损害大多数人幸福的基础上。到了资本主义社会，这种损人利己、唯利是图的个人主义发展到了顶峰，成为一种资产阶级的思想体系，并且具有极其虚伪和欺骗的性质。这就是资产阶级的极端个人主义。
    无产阶级的阶级本性，是高度的组织性、纪律性和集体主义精神。这是由于它的阶级地位和跟现代化大生产相联系的生活环境所决定的。这种组织性、纪律性和集体主义精神的最高的和集中的表现，就是共产党的党性。但是在无产阶级和共产党的队伍里，并不是每一个人都充分具有这种无产阶级本性和党性；有些同志在不同的程度上还保留着个人主义思想。
    这是什么原因呢？一般说来，有两个原因。
    第一个原因，是外部的剥削阶级及其他非无产阶级的影响和腐蚀。在社会主义革命和建设时期，阶级还没有完全消灭，无产阶级和共产党，总是要和非无产阶级共同生活在一个社会里，并且保持着一定的联系。一方面无产阶级在不断地改造和消灭着资产阶级，这是斗争的主要趋势和必然结局。但是另一方面，在这一斗争的过程中，资产阶级也在利用各种形式，力图影响、腐蚀无产阶级。因此无产阶级队伍内一部分不坚定的分子，就往往在这种影响和腐蚀之下，接受了异己的思想意识。右倾机会主义分子的出现，就是这种影响和腐蚀的结果。
    第二个原因，是内部的成份不纯。在资本主义社会里，无产阶级的队伍，经常是由相继破产了的小生产者来补充的。目前我国工人阶级的大部分，就是刚刚由合作化了的农民中吸收来的。我们党的主要成份，也是来自农民基本群众，少数的还来自剥削阶级家庭。因此在他们的思想意识里，必然会或多或少地存在着原来阶级的烙印。他们中间的大多数，经过了生产和战争的锻炼，经过了马克思列宁主义的教育，逐步地消除了原来阶级的本性，而且有了无产阶级的阶级性和党性。不过也有一小部分人，由于种种原因仍然保留着原来阶级的思想残余，个别的甚至原封未动。
    由于上述内外两方面的原因，在无产阶级及其先锋队——共产党的队伍里，仍然有资产阶级个人主义及其他非无产阶级的思想残余存在，就不是什么不可理解的怪事，而是完全可以理解的、合乎逻辑的现象了。
    资产阶级个人主义，是同无产阶级集体主义根本对立、水火不相容的，是党的团结的大敌，是无产阶级事业的大敌，是万恶之源。
    对于每个共产党员来说，不论地位高低，功劳大小，只要他保留着或者沾染了资产阶级个人主义思想，那么，他就必然在具有进步性、革命性的同时，也具有落后性、甚至反动性的一面。这种进步性、革命性的一面同落后性、反动性的一面的斗争过程，就是思想改造的过程。在思想改造的过程中，多数人的进步性、革命性会逐步发展；落后性、反动性会逐步削弱直至完全被克服。但也有极少数人可能相反，他们的进步性、革命性逐步减弱，而落后性、反动性却大大发展。一旦资产阶级个人主义思想在他们的头脑里占据了统治地位，他们就会犯这样那样的错误。因为资产阶级个人主义者遇到什么事情都要从个人得失、个人利害、个人好恶出发，这就必然会表现出政治上的投机性，组织上的排他性，生活上的自私性，思想方法上的狭隘性。
    所谓政治上的投机性，就是对于政治形势的估计，对于党的路线、政策和革命的群众运动，不是从无产阶级的根本利益出发，进行马克思主义的分析，采取积极热情的态度；而常常是从资产阶级、小资产阶级的立场出发，从个人利益和个人好恶出发去估计革命形势，理解路线政策，对待群众运动。因而在革命的紧要关头，他们往往会害怕阶级敌人，屈服于敌人的压力或畏惧暂时困难而陷入悲观、动摇的右倾机会主义的泥坑（目前这是主要的）；有时也会轻视敌人，为一时的胜利冲昏头脑而陷入盲动、冒险的“左”倾机会主义的泥坑。
    所谓组织上的排他性，就是在党员与党员、个人与组织、这一部分组织与那一部分组织、下级组织与上级组织的关系上，不是按照党的原则，而是按照他们的个人利益，决定是欢迎还是排斥，是拥护还是抵制，是提拔还是压抑，是团结还是分裂。这样，对同志就必然爱之欲其生，恶之欲其死；对干部就必然怒则投诸渊，喜则加诸膝；对组织对上级就必然合则阿谀逢迎，不合则对抗抵制。这样他就必然要犯宗派主义和闹独立性的错误，甚至发展到组织派别，进行反党的地步。
    所谓生活上的自私性，就是对荣誉、地位、物质待遇等问题，不是全心全意为着人民的利益，以廉洁奉公，正直无私，吃苦在前，享福在后的共产主义态度去处理，而是追求个人的私利，争名夺利，贪污腐化，力求舒适，害怕艰苦，严重的就会蜕化变质，堕落为违法乱纪的犯罪分子。
    所谓思想方法上的狭隘性，就是说个人主义可以使人利令智昏，不愿意或者不敢于正视客观事物，而主观地根据个人利益的需要和个人好恶，看他所愿意看的，听他所愿意听的；一切不合自己口味的东西，充耳不闻，视而不见。这样的思想方法就必然产生极大的主观性和片面性。结果，不是作教条主义的俘虏，就是作经验主义的工具。
    总之，个人主义为害无穷，可以使个人身败名裂；可以使党的事业遭受损害。历史上的教训很多，举不胜举。目前被揭露出来的右倾机会主义分子，几乎都有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想，这绝不是偶然的巧合，正是个人主义严重发展的必然结果。当然，这并不是说，一个共产党员只要没有个人主义思想，就不会再犯其他的错误。但是如果他确实没有任何个人主义思想的话，那么他犯重大错误的可能总是较小的。即使犯了错误，由于他没有个人得失的顾虑，纠正起来也是较快较彻底的。
    我们反对个人主义，并不是否定一切个人利益，更不是把一切个人合理的要求都说成是个人主义；相反的，党向来是而且只有党最能关心和正确处理党员正当的个人利益问题。例如：只有党能够根据党员个人对党对人民贡献的大小，给以恰如其分的政治的和物质的待遇；只有党能够根据党员个人的才能，分配他力能胜任的工作；只有党能够根据党员个人的政治、文化、业务水平，有计划有组织地加以培养提高，只有党能够根据党员个人的实际困难，在可能范围内给以无微不至的照顾。但是，党在处理党员的个人利益时，向来坚持一条原则，即党的利益高于一切，个人利益必须无条件地服从党的利益，在不违反党的利益的原则下，注意和照顾党员的个人利益。因此，就党员个人来说，任何把个人利益置于党的利益之上，或者把照顾个人利益作为服从党的决定的条件的个人主义行为，都是不能允许的。
