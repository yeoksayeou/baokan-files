　　Moving Towards the Final Year of the Three-Year Plan
　　By Our Correspondent Féng Yè
　　As we enter the harsh winter, the Mongolian grasslands are covered in a vast expanse of silver snow. The working people are seizing the last moments of this year, throwing themselves into intense labor and production to surpass their annual plans.
　　1959 is the second year of Mongolia's Three-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy and Culture, a year of decisive significance.
　　This year, the Mongolian people warmly responded to the call of the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, launching production competitions and achieving remarkable results on all fronts of production. The results of construction over the past year have proven that the call of the Third Plenary Session of the Mongolian Party Central Committee to comprehensively develop productive forces, expand and develop industrial and agricultural production, establish a socialist material base as quickly as possible, and further improve socialist relations of production has become a huge force inspiring the people to unleash their productive enthusiasm and has contributed to production and construction.
　　The achievements made by the Mongolian people in all aspects this year also prove that the Three-Year Plan, revised by the Third Plenary Session in March and approved by the Great People's Khural, is a realistic plan to accelerate socialist construction. All working people have expressed their determination to complete this plan ahead of schedule and surpass its targets.

　　One of the major achievements this year is the realization of collectivization in animal husbandry, Mongolia's main economic sector. According to recent statistics, 99.3% of the country's herdsmen have joined cooperatives, and the socialist transformation of individual herdsmen has been victorious. This glorious victory has made Mongolia's economic form a single socialist economy. The significance of this victory also lies in the creation of excellent conditions for the further development of pastoral and agricultural production, as well as favorable conditions for the gradual settlement of herdsmen and the establishment of consolidated fodder bases. A broad and infinitely bright future has been shown to the laboring herdsmen who make up the vast majority of the country's population.
　　The Mongolian pastoral cooperative movement has been flourishing in the past year. When the Party's 13th Congress was held last year, only 35% of the country's herdsmen had joined cooperatives. In order to accelerate pastoral collectivization, the Congress made a resolution requiring that most of the country's herdsmen join cooperatives by 1960. The Party's resolution was warmly supported by all herdsmen, and a high tide of collectivization quickly formed throughout the country. Herdsmen voluntarily signed up to join cooperatives, many Sums (counties) were collectivized, and some provinces were also collectivized. By this spring, collectivization had been basically realized throughout the country.
　　With the basic completion of collectivization, the basic-level administrative unit Baga (township), which was originally distributed throughout the grasslands, was no longer able to adapt to the new situation. Therefore, it was announced that the Baga would be abolished and the Sum would be merged with the cooperative. The administrative head of the Sum is also the leader of the cooperative. Streamlining the organization allows many cadres to directly participate in production. Currently, there are more than 400 Sums and a total of 389 cooperatives in the country. Each cooperative has a central area where economic and cultural institutions such as schools, clinics, shops, and canteens are established to serve the production and living needs of herdsmen.
　　This summer, after realizing collectivization, the laboring herdsmen of South Gobi Province further enhanced their ideological awareness. They voluntarily requested that their private livestock be re-entered into the cooperatives to better participate in collective production. According to the demands of the herdsmen, and for the further consolidation and development of the cooperatives, the Mongolian Party and government re-revised the draft model charter of the cooperatives, deciding to reduce the number of private livestock retained by members and appropriately increase the labor days of members. Following this, the laboring herdsmen launched a movement to re-enter private livestock into the cooperatives, increasing the number of collectively owned livestock. In 1958, livestock entering the cooperatives accounted for only 35% of the total number of livestock in the country. Now, collectively owned livestock has increased to 72%, and the enthusiasm of members for collective labor has further increased.
　　In the autumn, along with the victories in the collectivization and private livestock re-entry movement, the Mongolian grasslands reported good news of a bumper harvest. According to the results of this year's livestock count, the total number of livestock increased by more than 452,000 head compared to last year, an increase of 1.9%. Bayan-Ulgii and Bulgan provinces overfulfilled their livestock increase plans, completing the livestock increase tasks of the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule within two years (1958 and 1959). In 1960, the total number of livestock will increase to 24.3 million head, an increase of 1.6% compared to 1959. The collectivized herdsmen will surely be able to successfully complete this target.
　　Currently, herdsmen are braving the ice and snow to fight against nature and do a good job in protecting livestock through the winter. Soon, the Second Congress of Cooperatives will be held to discuss the consolidation of cooperatives and the development of production. Advanced herdsmen who have emerged in the collectivization movement will attend this congress.

　　This year is a year of great agricultural harvest for Mongolia. This is the result of the Mongolian Party and government's reclamation of wasteland and vigorous development of agricultural production.
　　In February of this year, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Council of Ministers made a decision to vigorously develop agricultural production, pointing out that simultaneously promoting the development of agricultural and pastoral production is a practical and important issue for increasing the number of livestock and improving the yield of livestock products. It requires meeting the domestic flour needs entirely within the next few years by expanding the cultivated area. To this end, it was decided to reclaim 88,600 hectares of wasteland this year and build four new state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms mainly for grain production.
　　Mongolia's decision to engage in wasteland reclamation and production has received economic, technical, and manpower assistance from the Soviet Union. Hundreds of new machines for reclaiming wasteland were transported from the Soviet Union, and more than 300 technical personnel were sent. Mongolian workers and Soviet technical experts worked together, throwing themselves into the heated battle of wasteland reclamation.
　　On the banks of the Kherlen and Orkhon rivers, in the basin of Lake Khövsgöl, and on many fertile virgin lands, young people drove tractors, plowing up the fragrant black soil. How fertile the soil is, people expect to grow fruitful results.
　　The young farm workers sowed the seeds of wheat, oats, and other grains. The seedlings emerged from the soil, growing strong and upright; during the growth period, they grew strong and plump. The grain matured in the autumn, and the newly reclaimed land won its first harvest.
　　This year, Mongolia overfulfilled the task of reclaiming wasteland. More than 150,000 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed, and the sown area increased by 52% compared to last year, reaching 150,000 hectares. Among them, state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms cultivated more than 111,000 hectares, with a grain output of more than 112,000 tons, completing 123.6% of the production plan, an increase of nearly double compared to last year's production volume. The yield per unit area has also increased compared to the past, with the average yield of wheat being 1.1 tons per hectare, and some agricultural and pastoral farms reaching a yield of 2.5 tons per hectare.
　　On the basis of the bumper grain harvest, the grain task handed over to the state by various agricultural and pastoral farms has also been overfulfilled. This has prepared sufficient raw materials for the emerging flour processing industry. This year's agricultural harvest also proves that the prospects for agricultural production are broad, and it is entirely possible to meet the domestic flour needs within the next few years.
　　Currently, agricultural production is mainly operated by state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms. Each agricultural and pastoral farm has tens of thousands of hectares of cultivated land and grasslands. The Kharakhorum agricultural and pastoral farm, which has only been built for three years, cultivated 12,000 hectares of land this year and harvested 16,000 tons of grain. The land is boundless, and the prospects are infinitely bright. Agricultural and pastoral farms use machinery for cultivation on large areas of land. There are a total of 1,864 tractors in the country (each calculated at 15 horsepower), with each farm having 25 to 125 tractors. There are also more than 500 combine harvesters.
　　Agricultural technicians on agricultural and pastoral farms are growing rapidly. This year, more than 800 tractor drivers were trained in the work of reclaiming wasteland, and they have contributed greatly to the wasteland reclamation work.
　　This year, an important step has been taken in wasteland reclamation and production, laying a solid foundation for continuing to expand the cultivated area in 1960. Next year, the cultivated area will reach 252,000 hectares, requiring the sown area of wheat to be doubled compared to this year, meeting 70% of the flour needs of the people nationwide.
　　Currently, farm workers are using winter as a season for learning. They are learning agronomic knowledge and various technologies. They will learn to operate machines as skillfully as they ride horses.

　　Mongolia's industrial, construction, and transportation sectors have seen further development this year.
　　In the first nine months of this year, industrial production completed 100.3% of the three-quarter plan, and product output increased by 6.7% compared to the same period last year. Among them, the production of means of production increased by 5.3%, and the production of consumer goods increased by 12%. The production plans for electricity, gasoline, leather, cream, and other products have been overfulfilled.
　　This year, Mongolia built and expanded many factories, and some newly built factories are emerging enterprises that did not exist in the past.
　　A pulp and paper mill and a prefabricated wooden structure house factory were completed and put into production simultaneously in Sukhbaatar city this autumn. These two factories, together with a thermal power plant built last year, form a new industrial base. The paper mill has an annual output of 3,500 tons of various types of paper, and the prefabricated wooden structure house factory has an annual output of 20,000 square meters of wooden house components. The completion of these two new factories will make good use of the forest resources in the north to meet the people's need for paper and the housing needs of settled herdsmen.
　　Currently, a large-scale flour processing plant is also under construction in Sukhbaatar city. This city is forming Mongolia's second industrial city.
　　In Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, there are many construction projects this year, with a wide range of projects, from production and construction, social and cultural welfare construction, to new bridges, roads, and the installation of underground water and heating pipes. Everywhere is a busy construction scene.
　　The new factory buildings of the newly built woolen textile factory, shoe factory, and flour mill stand tall in the suburbs of the capital. Some have already started production, and some are about to be put into production. On a construction site of 90,000 square meters, dozens of three- and four-story workers' dormitories are under construction. The houses are arranged on both sides of a new road, which will form a beautiful street. When a dormitory is completed, people move in with furniture and joy. The construction workers are speeding up the construction speed, and they are also actively building with a happy mood, striving to complete the project as soon as possible.
　　Several asphalt roads in the city and surrounding areas have been built. They are flat and wide, and are connected to the surrounding new building complexes, making people feel that the city is becoming more and more beautiful. In order to beautify the capital, the staff of government agencies and citizens participated in several voluntary labor activities this year. The leaders of the Party and the state also held hoes and shovels to work with the workers. Everyone participated in the excavation and repair of water and heating pipeline projects. Now, the first phase of the water and heating pipeline project has been put into use, and people are enjoying the happy fruits of their labor.
　　In Mongolia's industrial and other cultural and welfare construction, assistance has been received from the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries. Chinese workers are working side by side with Mongolian workers for Mongolia's socialist construction.
　　This year's basic construction tasks in Mongolia's cities and villages have exceeded any previous year. During the first Five-Year Plan, the total construction area in the country was more than 81,000 square meters, and this year's construction area has reached 200,000 square meters. From this figure, we can imagine the development of basic construction. This year's construction tasks have been completed well, with the first three quarters overfulfilling the plan by 6.4%.
　　In terms of transportation, with the development of construction, the tasks have also increased. In the first nine months of this year, the volume of freight transportation increased by 9.4% compared to the same period last year, and the passenger transportation plan was completed by 104.2%.

　　Cultural, educational, and health work has made further progress this year compared to the past. The number of students at all levels of schools has increased. Among them, the number of students in ordinary schools increased by 3.2%, the number of students in specialized schools increased by 7.8%, and the number of college students increased by 8%. The number of medical institutions, medical equipment, and maternal and child health care institutions has increased compared to last year.
　　An important event in this year's cultural construction is that the people of the whole country have responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and launched a movement to advance towards culture throughout the country.
　　The decision to launch the cultural advancement was made by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in July of this year – on the eve of the 38th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution. The decision requires that socialist culture be raised to a new stage of development within two years by the 40th anniversary of the People's Revolution in 1961.
　　The basic task of this socialist cultural revolution is to enable adults to have the knowledge level of ordinary education, to require everyone to develop healthy and civilized living habits, eliminate diseases, develop sports and mass culture, strengthen patriotism and internationalism education, and improve the communist education level of the working people. Three basic slogans were put forward: everyone should pay attention to hygiene; everyone should advance in education (such as literacy for the illiterate); everyone should abide by social order and public discipline, develop good moral character, and fight against bad phenomena such as alcoholism and troublemaking.
　　This is a revolution of socialist ideology and consciousness against the remaining old ideology and consciousness, a struggle between the new and the old. Through this cultural revolution, the people's cultural and health conditions will reach the level required by socialism.
　　This decision has been warmly responded to by the people of the whole country. Everyone, in light of their actual situation, has formulated plans to advance towards culture and expressed their intention to change their lives and thoughts in this movement. The working people of Ulaanbaatar have responded to the Party's call with practical actions to beautify the city, improve public health, and improve culture. In pastoral areas, while carrying out various propaganda activities, various measures such as building clubs, libraries, sports fields, and bathhouses are taken to create various conditions for advancing towards culture.
　　Among young workers and herdsmen, under the call to advance towards culture, a movement to strive to become a "socialist labor team" has been launched. Young people demand to produce, study, and live in a socialist way, demand to improve their skills, and become truly cultured people. A new batch of advanced figures is emerging in factories and pastoral areas. Khasbaatar, an electric welder at the First Automobile Transportation Station in Mongolia, worked 2,500 hours in 22 months, completing the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Tsevelmaa, a sewing worker in Khuvsgul province, also completed the Three-Year Plan in one year and nine months. New people and new things are constantly encouraging people to move forward.
　　The basic task of Mongolia's Three-Year Plan is to enable productive forces to achieve new and comprehensive development, further develop various sectors of the national economy on the basis of consolidating the socialist component of agriculture and animal husbandry, and continuously improve the people's material and cultural living standards. Completing the 1959 construction plan is of decisive significance for completing and overfulfilling the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
　　Now the victorious 1959 is about to pass. The Mongolian people are confidently moving forward towards the last year of the Three-Year Plan – 1960.

　　向三年计划的最后一年迈进
　　本报记者　逢烨
    时序进入严冬，蒙古草原，白雪茫茫，一派银色世界。劳动人民正抓住这一年的最后时刻，为超额完成年度计划，投入紧张的劳动生产中。
    1959年，是蒙古发展国民经济和文化的三年计划的第二年，是有决定意义的一年。
    这一年，蒙古人民热烈响应蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会和三中全会的号召，开展生产竞赛，在各个生产战线上，都取得了显著的成绩。一年来的建设结果证明，蒙古党的三中全会提出全面发展生产力，扩大和发展工业、农牧业生产，尽快建立社会主义物质基础，更加健全和改善社会主义生产关系的号召，已成为鼓舞人民发挥生产积极性的巨大力量，并且在生产建设中作出了贡献。
    今年蒙古人民在各方面获得的成就，同时证明3月三中全会修订的并经大人民呼拉尔会议通过的三年计划，是一个切合实际的加快社会主义建设的计划。全体劳动人民表示决心，要提前和超额完成这个计划。一
    今年获得的重大成就之一是，作为蒙古主要经济部门的畜牧业，已经实现了合作化。最近统计，全国牧民的99.3％都已加入了合作社，个体牧民的社会主义改造取得了胜利。这个光辉的胜利，使蒙古的经济形式成为单一的社会主义经济了。这个胜利的意义还在于，为牧业和农业生产创造了进一步发展的优良条件，也为牧民逐步定居和建立巩固的饲料基地创造了有利的条件。在占全国人口绝大多数的劳动牧民面前，展示了广阔的、无限美好的未来。
    蒙古牧业合作化运动是在最近一年来蓬勃开展起来的。去年召开党的第十三次代表大会时，全国只有35％的牧民入社。为了加速牧业合作化，大会作出决议，要求到1960年，使全国大多数的牧民加入合作社。党的决议，得到全体牧民的热烈拥护，很快在全国范围内形成合作化的高潮，牧民们自愿报名加入合作社，许多苏木（县）合作化了，一些省也合作化了，到今年春天，全国基本上实现了合作化。
    随着合作化的基本完成，原来分布在草原各地的基层行政单位巴嘎（乡），已经不能和新的形势相适应了，于是宣布撤销巴嘎，实行苏木和合作社合一，苏木的行政负责人同时是合作社的领导人。精简机构，使很多干部直接参加生产。现在，全国有四百多个苏木，共有三百八十九个合作社。每个合作社都有一个中心地区，在那里分别设立了学校、医疗所、商店和食堂等经济、文化机构，为牧民的生产和生活需要服务。
    今年夏天，南戈壁省的劳动牧民，在实现了合作化后，思想觉悟进一步提高了，他们自动要求把自留牲畜再行入社，更好的参加集体生产。蒙古党和政府根据牧民的要求，为了合作社的进一步巩固和发展，重新修订了合作社的示范章程草案，决定减少社员的自留牲畜头数，适当增加社员的劳动日。接着，劳动牧民开展了一个自留牲畜再入社的运动，使社有牲畜增多了。1958年入社牲畜仅占全国牲畜总头数的35％，现在社有牲畜已经增加到72％，社员的集体劳动积极性更加提高了。
    秋天，在合作化和自留牲畜再入社运动取得胜利的同时，蒙古草原传来丰收的喜讯。据今年清点牲畜的结果表明，牲畜总头数比去年增加了四十五万二千多头，即增加了1.9％。巴彦乌列盖和布拉干两省超额完成增畜计划，在1958和1959年两年内，提前完成了三年计划的增畜任务。1960年，牲畜总头数将增加到二千四百三十万头，即比1959年增加1.6％。实现了合作化的牧民，一定能胜利的完成这个指标。
    现在，牧民们正冒着冰雪严寒，和自然进行斗争，作好保畜过冬工作。不久以后，这里将召开合作社第二次代表大会，讨论巩固合作社和发展生产的问题，在合作化运动中涌现出来的先进牧民们，将出席这次大会。二
    今年是蒙古获得农业大丰收的一年。这是蒙古党和政府开垦荒地、大力发展农业生产的结果。
    今年2月间，蒙古人民革命党中央和部长会议，作出了大力发展农业生产的决定，指出同时提倡发展农业和牧业生产，是增加牲畜头数及提高畜产品产量的实际的重要问题。要求通过扩大耕地面积的途径，在最近几年内全部满足国内面粉的需要。为此决定今年开垦荒地八万八千六百公顷，新建四个以谷物生产为主的国营农牧场。
    蒙古开荒生产的决定，得到苏联经济技术和人力的援助。从苏联运来了几百台开垦荒地的新机器，派来了三百多名技术人员。蒙古职工和苏联技术专家一起，投入了开垦荒地的火热的战斗中。
    在克鲁伦、鄂尔浑河边，在库苏古尔的盆地上，以及许许多多的肥沃的处女地上，青年们驾驶着拖拉机，把芬香的黑土耕翻出来。多么肥沃的土壤啊，人们期待着长出丰硕的果实来。
    年青的农场工人们，把小麦、燕麦和其他谷物的种子播种下去，禾苗出土了，茁壮挺拔；在生长期间，结实饱满。谷物在秋后成熟了，新垦地上赢得了第一次丰收。
    今年蒙古超额完成了开垦荒地的任务。开荒十五万多公顷，播种面积比去年增加了52％，达到十五万公顷。其中，国营农牧场耕种了十一万一千多公顷，谷物产量十一万二千多吨，完成生产计划的123.6％，比去年的生产量增加近一倍。单位面积产量也比过去提高了，小麦每公顷的平均产量为十一公担，有的农牧场每公顷产量达到二十五公担。
    在谷物丰收的基础上，各农牧场上交国家的粮食任务也超额完成了。这就为新兴的面粉加工工业准备了充足的原料。今年的农业丰收，同时证明了农业生产的前景广阔，最近几年内满足国内面粉的需要是完全可能的。
    目前，农业生产主要由国营农牧场经营。每个农牧场都有上万公顷和几万公顷的耕地和草原。新建才三年的哈拉和林农牧场，今年就耕种一万二千公顷土地，收获了一万六千吨粮食。土地无垠，前景无限美好。农牧场在大面积土地上，都使用机械耕种。全国共有一千八百六十四台拖拉机（每台以十五马力计算），每个场有二十五台到一百二十五台。另有五百多台收割机。
    农牧场的农业技术人员正在迅速的成长。今年在开垦荒地工作中，培养了八百多名拖拉机手，他们对垦荒工作贡献了很大力量。
    今年在垦荒、生产迈出了重要的一步，为1960年继续扩大耕地面积打下了坚固的基础。明年，耕地面积将达到二十五万二千公顷，要求小麦的播种面积比今年增加一倍，满足全国人民面粉需要的70％。
    现在，农场工人们正把冬天作为学习的季节，他们学习农艺知识和各种技术，他们将像骑马那样纯熟的学好操纵机器。三
    蒙古的工业、建筑和交通运输事业，今年有了进一步的发展。
    今年头九个月，工业生产完成三个季度计划的100.3％，产品产量比去年同期增加了6.7％，其中，生产资料的生产增长了5.3％，消费用品的生产增长了12％。电力、汽油、皮革、奶油等产品的生产计划都超额完成了。
    今年蒙古新建和扩建了许多工厂，有些新建工厂是过去没有的新兴企业。
    一个制浆造纸厂和一个木结构房屋预制厂，今年秋天同时在苏赫巴托尔市建成，投入生产了。这两个工厂和去年建成的一个热电站，联成了一片，成为一个新的工业基地。造纸厂年产各种纸张三千五百吨，木结构房屋预制厂年产木房屋构件两万平方米。这两个新工厂的建成，将很好利用北部的森林资源，来满足人民用纸和牧民定居的房屋需要。
    现在，在苏赫巴托市，一个大型面粉加工厂又在开工兴建。这个城市正在形成蒙古的第二个工业城市。
    在蒙古首都乌兰巴托，今年建设的项目多，范围广，从生产建设、社会文化福利建设，到新建桥梁、马路，安装地下水、暖气管道，到处是一片繁忙的建设景象。
    新建的毛纺织厂、皮鞋厂和面粉厂的新厂房，分别在首都郊区耸立起来了。有的已开始生产，有的就要投入生产了。在九万平方米的工地上，几十幢三、四层楼的职工宿舍正在兴建，房屋排列在一条新马路的两边，将组成一条漂亮的大街。一幢宿舍交工了，人们带着家具，带着喜悦的心情搬进去。建筑工人们加快施工速度，他们同样以愉快的心情积极建设，争取早日交工。
    市内和环绕着市区的几条柏油马路，已经修建起来了，平整而宽广，和四周的新建筑群联系起来，使人感到这个城市越来越美丽了。为了美化首都，机关职工和市民们今年参加好几次义务劳动，党和国家的领导人也曾经执镐拿锹，和工人们一起劳动。大家参加挖修水、暖管道的工程。现在，第一期水、暖管道工程已经交付使用，人们享受着劳动的幸福果实了。
    在蒙古的工业和其他文化福利的建设中，得到苏联、中国以及其他兄弟国家的援助。中国工人们正和蒙古工人们一起，为蒙古的社会主义建设并肩劳动。
    今年蒙古城市和乡村的基本建设任务，超过了过去任何一年。在第一个五年计划期间，全国的建筑面积为八万一千多平方米，今年的建筑面积达到二十万平方米。从这个数字就可以想见基本建设的发展情况了。今年的建筑任务完成得好，前三季度超额6.4％完成了计划。
    在交通运输业方面，随着建设的发展，任务也加多了。今年头九个月的货物运输量比去年同期增加了9.4％，以104.2％完成了客运计划。四
    文化教育卫生工作，今年比过去又有了进展。各级学校的学生人数都增多了。其中，普通学校学生增加了3.2％，专科学校增加了7.8％，大学生增加8％。医疗机构、医疗设备以及妇幼保健机构都比去年增多。
    今年在文化建设方面的重要事件是：全国人民响应蒙古人民革命党中央的号召，在全国范围内开展向文化进军的运动。
    开展文化进军的决定，是蒙古人民革命党中央政治局在今年7月——蒙古人民革命胜利三十八周年前夕作出的。决定要求到1961年人民革命四十周年时的两年内，把社会主义文化提高到新的发展阶段。
    这次社会主义文化革命的基本任务是，使成年人都有普通教育的知识水平，要求大家养成健康的文明生活习惯，消除疾病，发展体育和群众文化，加强爱国主义和国际主义教育，提高劳动人民的共产主义教育水平。提出了三个基本口号：人人讲卫生；人人在教育方面进级（如文盲要识字等）；人人遵守社会秩序和公共纪律，养成良好的道德风尚，和酗酒、闹事等不良现象作斗争。
    这是以社会主义的思想意识，对残存的旧的思想意识的革命，是新与旧的斗争。通过这次文化革命，将使人民的文化和健康状况，达到社会主义要求的水平。
    这个决定，得到全国人民的热烈响应。大家联系自己的实际情况，纷纷制定了向文化进军的计划，并表示要在这个运动中改变生活和思想面貌。乌兰巴托市劳动人民，以美化市容，改进公共卫生，提高文化的实际行动来响应党的号召。在牧区，进行各种宣传活动的同时，并采取修建俱乐部、图书馆、运动场和洗澡堂等各项措施，为向文化进军创造各种条件。
    在青年职工和牧民中，在向文化进军的号召下，开展了争取成为“社会主义劳动队”的运动。青年们要求以社会主义的方式生产、学习和生活，要求提高技术，成为真正的有文化的人。工厂和牧区正在涌现一批新的先进人物。蒙古第一汽车运输站的电焊工人哈斯巴图，在二十二个月中作了二千五百小时的工作，提前完成了三年计划。后杭爱省缝纫工人策伯勒玛也在一年零九个月中完成了三年计划。新人和新事，不断鼓舞着人们前进。
    蒙古三年计划的基本任务是使生产力得到新的全面的发展，在巩固农牧业社会主义成分的基础上进一步发展国民经济的各个部门，不断提高人民的物质文化生活水平。而完成1959年的建设计划，对提前和超额完成三年计划有决定意义。
    现在胜利的1959年就要过去了。蒙古人民正满怀信心地向着三年计划的最后一年——1960年迈步前进。
