    Shandong, as well as many other provinces, has recently put forward a slogan: "Take pig raising as the key link, promote the prosperity of the six domestic animals, and achieve an all-round leap forward in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry." This slogan profoundly reflects the relationship between animal husbandry and agriculture and forestry, and also grasps the pig, the key to developing animal husbandry. The short proverb "Abundant harvests of grain, prosperity of the six domestic animals" embodies the desire for a prosperous life pursued by Chinese farmers for generations and reflects the close relationship of mutual promotion between agriculture and animal husbandry. The long history and rich practice of agricultural production in China profoundly prove the interdependent and mutually promoting dialectical relationship between "abundant harvests of grain" and "prosperity of the six domestic animals." Abundant harvests of grain are the foundation for the prosperity of the six domestic animals; the prosperity of the six domestic animals in turn promotes abundant harvests of grain. Only with the great development of agriculture, providing a sufficient material basis for animal husbandry—rich feed—can animal husbandry develop steadily and at high speed. With the development of animal husbandry, it can provide more fertilizer, power, and funds for agriculture, which in turn promotes the continuous leap forward of agricultural production. At present, the main source of fertilizer in our country is farm manure, which mainly relies on pig manure, cattle, horse, and sheep manure, as well as other organic fertilizers. The main power source for agricultural production in our country also mainly relies on large domestic animals such as cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules. Without fertilizer, crops will not grow well; without draft animals, it is difficult to complete farming tasks. Therefore, grasping agricultural production on the one hand and animal husbandry production on the other, with vigorous development of pig raising as a central link at present, is of particularly important significance for the overall development of China's rural economy.
    Since ancient times, the pig has been at the end of the six domestic animals, called "horse, cattle, sheep, chicken, dog, and pig (豕)," this ranking is really unfair. According to the importance of the six domestic animals to industrial and agricultural production and human life, it should be "pig, cattle, sheep, horse, chicken, dog," that is to say, elevating the pig to the head of the six domestic animals is the right thing to do.
    This is certainly not to say that horses, cattle, and sheep are not important and do not need to be developed rapidly. No. Horses, cattle, and sheep are still very important to agricultural production and people's lives, and every effort must be made to accelerate their development. However, due to the characteristics of the pig itself, special attention should be given to it among the six domestic animals. First of all, pigs reproduce quickly. As long as they are properly fed and managed, a sow can give birth five times in two years. A litter of piglets usually has around ten, and some even have twenty or thirty. After the piglets are born, they can be bred again in about half a year. A sow that is well fed can breed forty or fifty piglets a year. Piglets give birth to more piglets, and the number increases even more. Horses, cattle, and sheep are not as fast as pigs in comparison. Horses need to grow for three years before they can breed, and cattle need to grow for two years, and they only produce once a year, one at a time. Sheep breed at most three times in two years, and generally only produce one lamb, at most twins or triplets. Therefore, in terms of the speed of development among the six domestic animals, pigs undoubtedly occupy the top spot.
    Secondly, and more importantly, pigs can provide the largest amount, most frequent, and highest quality fertilizer. Pig manure is an organic chemical fertilizer, which not only contains the large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium elements urgently needed by crops but also contains relatively rich organic matter, which can enhance the activity of microorganisms in the soil. Applying it to the ground can not only supply the necessary nutrients for crops but also cultivate the soil and improve the soil. Pig manure contains about 0.60% nitrogen, and it is a fast-acting fertilizer that can be directly applied to the ground, suitable for various soils and various crops. Horse manure contains about 0.50% nitrogen, and cattle manure contains about 0.30% nitrogen, both lower than pig manure, and need to be fermented before they can be applied. Although sheep manure has a slightly higher nitrogen content, it rots more slowly, the quantity is small, and collection is not as easy as pig manure. In this way, pig manure is not only ten times better than inorganic chemical fertilizers, but also has more advantages than other livestock manure. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that a pig is a small organic fertilizer factory. On average, a pig can produce about forty dan of pig manure a year, and one dan of pig manure can increase grain production by about five to ten jin, so forty dan of manure can increase grain production by two hundred to four hundred jin. According to analysis and testing, forty dan of pig manure contains absorbable pure nitrogen approximately equivalent to the nitrogen content of sixty jin of ammonium sulfate. Calculating that each jin of ammonium sulfate increases grain production by three to five jin, the manure from one pig can also increase grain production by two to three hundred jin. Raising pigs is much easier than running a local chemical fertilizer factory, not only can communes and production teams raise them in large numbers, but even production small teams, public canteens, and commune members can raise them. As long as every commune and every team runs its own pig farm, as long as every household raises pigs, we can set up tens of millions, hundreds of millions of small organic fertilizer "factories" across the country, which is indeed the best way to solve the fertilizer problem in a faster, better, and more economical way. Many places have done this, getting both fertilizer and pigs, and increasing grain production, with extremely good results. In Hongcheng Commune, Shaowu County, Fujian Province, the Datong rice production specialized team realized one pig per mu this year. The amount of fertilizer applied was three times higher than that of ordinary teams. After a large amount of pig manure was applied, the land underwent four major changes: the soil changed from hard and compacted to loose, the soil color changed from gray-yellow to oily-black, the soil aggregate structure was greatly improved, and water retention changed from being dry after five days without rain to not being dry even after more than ten days without rain. This year, the average yield of rice in this team reached 1,613 jin per mu, an increase of 100% compared to last year. The fertilizer cost per mu of land was reduced from 9.3 yuan to 1.8 yuan, and a large amount of labor for accumulating fertilizer was saved. The benefits of raising pigs are as the masses say: increase pigs, increase fertilizer, increase grain; benefit the country, benefit the collective, and benefit oneself.
    Pigs supply grain (fertilizer) to crops on the one hand, and meat to humans on the other. With the continuous improvement of the living standards of the Chinese people, people's need for meat will also increase day by day. Raising pigs is the main key to solving the meat problem in our country. Pigs are not only highly fertile but also grow very quickly. Generally, in seven or eight months, at most ten months or so, they can grow into large, fat pigs weighing one or two hundred jin. From the perspective of continuously improving people's lives and meeting people's needs for pork, rapidly developing pig raising is also very important. Raising a large number of pigs is also beneficial to solving the oil problem. The oil produced by a 150-jin fat pig can offset the oil yield of one mu of soybeans. The oil produced by three 150-jin fat pigs can offset the oil yield of one mu of peanuts.
    The benefits of raising pigs for developing the commune's economy and increasing the income of commune members are even more obvious. Now let's briefly calculate this account: a pig from a piglet to a large pig takes about eight months to a year, and it can grow into a large, fat pig weighing more than one hundred jin. During this time, about forty dan of pig manure can be accumulated, worth about four yuan. Selling a meat pig to the state, calculated at 150 jin live weight, is worth about fifty yuan. Feeding a fat pig requires about one hundred jin of concentrated feed and some roughage, totaling about ten yuan in price, and buying a piglet costs about ten yuan. The labor spent on raising can roughly offset the cost of pig manure. Therefore, the net profit from raising a pig is generally about thirty yuan. A feeder in a collective pig farm who raises fifty fat pigs can increase the commune's income by 1,500 yuan a year, which is certainly an important source of capital accumulation for the people's commune. This year, the train engine brigade of the Hongqi Commune in Shaxian, Fujian, had an income of more than 70,000 yuan from raising pigs, accounting for 26.9% of the total income of the team, with an average of more than 290 yuan per household. This only refers to the income of the commune and commune members. If we consider the social value created by pigs, it would be even greater. Pigs have bristles, skin, bones, and internal organs, which are important raw materials for the leather industry, the wool textile industry, and the chemical industry. Pork, pigskin, pig bristles, and casings are also important export commodities. One ton of pork can be exchanged for five tons of steel, twelve boxes of pig bristles can be exchanged for a tractor, and one barrel of pig casings can be exchanged for more than eleven tons of fertilizer. To realize the modernization and mechanization of agriculture in our country, on the one hand, we must rely on our country's own industry to equip and support it; on the other hand, if our country's pig raising industry is greatly developed and more commodity pigs are produced for export, we can exchange for more chemical fertilizers, steel, and tractors to directly support the modernization of agriculture.
    Since the Party Central Committee and the State Council instructed the rural areas across the country to launch a pig raising upsurge this winter, the pig raising industry has developed rapidly in various places. The number of pigs in the country increased by 5.4% in October compared to September, and by another 9% in November compared to October. According to incomplete statistics from some areas in fifteen provinces (municipalities), three counties, sixty-seven people's communes, and more than four thousand production teams across the country have realized one pig per mu. There are even more regions and units that have realized one pig per person. We have long ago reached and exceeded one pig per household nationwide. Now, the people of our country should establish lofty ambitions and strive to achieve one pig for every two people in a not too long time, and then strive to achieve one pig per person or even a little more.
    To achieve such a goal, much hard work is naturally still required. Party committees in various places must first put politics in command, be full of energy, and launch mass movements on a large scale, elevating pig raising to the same important position as grain work. Pig fertilizer is the grain of crops, crops are the grain of livestock, and crops and livestock (especially pigs) are all the grain of mankind. As the folk song says: "There are so many benefits to raising pigs, it's like shooting three birds with one arrow, increasing the accumulation of fertilizer to ensure production, and increasing income and more meat." Why shouldn't we do such a good thing? All urban and rural areas across the country, except for a few ethnic minority areas that prohibit pigs, should be mobilized to raise pigs in large quantities and obtain more high-quality fertilizer and more meat from pigs. In rural areas, every commune and team should have pig farms, and every household should raise fat pigs. Factories, government offices, and schools with conditions in cities should find ways to raise pigs to solve the meat supply of their units.
    Now, wherever pig raising has developed rapidly, many good experiences have been created in implementing policies, solving problems of funds, feed, pig sources, feeding management, and reforming pig raising tools. It can be imagined that when these experiences are better disseminated and promoted, the pig raising industry across the country will definitely develop faster, and a greater pig raising upsurge will definitely appear in the vast rural people's communes across the country. The people of our country must make the greatest determination, muster soaring enthusiasm, and concentrate their efforts in the coming year to accelerate the reproduction of pigs, so that the number of pigs in stock will be greatly increased. We believe that under the strong leadership of the Party, most of the people's communes in our country will be able to gradually realize two pigs per person, one pig per person, or even a little more in a few years, so that the fertilizer problem needed for developing agricultural production in our country and the meat problem of the people of our country will be fundamentally solved.

    猪为六畜之首
    山东以及很多别的省区，最近提出了一个口号，叫作“以养猪为纲六畜兴旺，农林牧全面跃进”。这个口号既深刻地反映了畜牧业与农业林业的关系，又抓住了猪这个发展畜牧业的重点。“五谷丰登，六畜兴旺”这两句简短的谚语，是我国农民世世代代所追求的富裕生活的愿望，也体现了农牧业相互促进的密切关系。我国农业生产的悠久历史和丰富实践，深刻地证明了“五谷丰登”和“六畜兴旺”的互相依存、互相促进的辩证关系。五谷丰登是六畜兴旺的基础；六畜兴旺又促进了五谷丰登。只有农业的大发展，为畜牧业提供充分的物质基础——丰富的饲料，畜牧业才能稳定地高速度地发展。畜牧业发展了，就可以为农业提供更多的肥料、动力和资金，这又促进了农业生产的持续跃进。目前我国的肥料来源，主要是依靠农家肥料，也就是主要依靠猪粪、牛马羊粪以及其他有机肥料。我国农业生产的主要动力，也主要是依靠牛、马、驴、骡等大家畜。肥料缺乏庄稼长不好；没有役畜又很难完成耕作任务。因此，一手抓农业生产，一手抓畜牧业生产，而以大力发展养猪作为当前一个中心环节，这对我国农村经济的全面发展具有特别重要的意义。
    自古以来，猪位于六畜之末，叫作“马、牛、羊、鸡、犬、豕（即猪）”，这种排法实在很不公平。按照六畜对于工农业生产和人类生活的重要性来说，应该是“猪、牛、羊、马、鸡、犬”，也就是说把猪提升到六畜之首，才是天公地道。
    这当然不是说马牛羊不重要，不需要迅速发展。不是的。马牛羊对农业生产和人民生活仍然很重要，也必须尽一切可能加速发展。但是，由于猪本身具备的特点，应该在六畜中给于特别的重视。首先，猪繁殖得快。只要饲养得法，管理得当，一头母猪两年可生五次猪仔。一窝猪仔一般有十个上下，多的达二、三十个。小猪生下来以后，半年左右又可配种繁殖。一头母猪喂养得好，一年能繁殖四五十头小猪。小猪再生小猪，数量就更加多了。马、牛、羊比较起来就不如猪快。马要长三年才能配种，牛长二年配种，又都是一年产一次，一次产一个。羊至多两年配三次，一般只产一羔，至多产双羔、三羔。因此，在六畜中，就发展的速度来说，猪无疑占有首席。
    其次，更重要的是猪能够提供最大量、最经常、质量最高的肥料。猪粪肥是有机化学肥料，它不仅含有作物所迫切需要的多量的氮、磷、钾三要素，而且含有比较丰富的有机物，可以增强土壤中微生物的活动，施在地里不仅能供给作物必需的养分，还能培养地力和改良土壤。猪粪含氮素0.60％左右，而且是速效肥，可以直接施到地里，适用于各种土壤和各种作物。马粪含氮0.50％左右，牛粪含氮0.30％左右，都比猪粪低，又需经过发酵才能施用。羊粪含氮量虽略高，但腐熟较慢，数量少，收集也不如猪粪容易。这样看来，猪粪不仅比无机化学肥料要优胜十倍，而且也比别的家畜粪肥具有更多优点。因此，说一头猪就是一个小型有机化肥工厂，是一点也不夸大的。平均起来，一头猪一年大约可产四十担左右的猪粪，一担猪粪大约可增产五斤到十斤左右的粮食，四十担粪就可以增产二百斤到四百斤粮食。据分析化验，四十担猪粪中含有可以被作物吸收的纯氮约相当于六十斤硫酸铵的含氮量。按每一斤硫酸铵增产粮食三、五斤计算，一头猪的粪肥也可增产二、三百斤粮食。养猪比办土化肥厂要容易多了，不仅公社和生产队可以大养特养，连生产小队、公共食堂和社员也可以养。只要社社、队队都办起自己的养猪场，只要家家户户都来养猪，我们就可以在全国办起上千万、上万万的小型有机化肥“工厂”，这确是多快好省地解决肥料问题的一个最好的途径。许多地方这样做了，既得肥，又得猪，又增产粮食，效果极好。福建省邵武县红城公社有个大同水稻生产专业队，今年实现了一亩地一头猪以后，施肥量比一般队增加三倍，大量增施猪粪以后，土地发生四大变化：土质由板结变疏松，土色由灰黄变油黑，土壤团粒结构状况大为改善，保水由五天不雨就旱变成十多天不雨不旱。今年这个队水稻平均亩产达一千六百十三斤，比去年增产一倍。每亩田的肥料成本反而由九元三角降到一元八角，并且节约了大量的积肥劳动力。养猪的好处正如群众所说：增猪、增肥、增粮；利国、利社和利己。
    猪一方面给农作物供给粮食（肥料），一方面又给人类供给肉食。随着我国人民生活水平的不断提高，人们对于肉食的需要也会日益增多起来。养猪是解决我国肉食问题的主要关键。猪不仅繁殖力强，也生长得很快。一般七八个月，至多十来个月，就能长成一二百斤的大肥猪。从不断改善人民生活满足人民对猪肉的需要来说，迅速发展养猪事业也是十分重要的。大量养猪，还有利于解决油料问题。一头一百五十斤的肥猪所出的油，可以抵上一亩大豆的出油量。三头一百五十斤肥猪出的油，能抵上一亩花生的出油量。
    养猪对于发展公社经济、增加社员收入的好处更加明显。现在我们就来简单地算一算这笔账：一头猪从小猪养大，约需八个月到一年的时间，就可长成百斤以上的大肥猪。在这个时间内，可积猪肥四十担左右，约值四元左右。肉猪卖给国家，按一百五十斤毛重计算，约值五十元左右。喂一头肥猪约需一百斤精饲料和若干粗饲料，共折价约十元左右，买仔猪大约十元一头。饲养所花费的人工大体可以抵猪粪款。因此，养一头猪纯利一般可达三十元左右。一个集体养猪场的饲养员饲养五十头肥猪，一年就可为公社增加一千五百元的收入，这当然是人民公社资金积累的重要来源之一。福建沙县红旗公社火车头大队今年养猪收入达七万多元，占全队总收入的26.9％，按户平均，每户就有二百九十多元。这仅仅是指公社和社员收入。如果就猪创造的社会价值而言，那就更多了。猪有鬃、有皮、有骨、有内脏，是制革工业、毛纺工业和化学工业的重要原料。猪肉、猪皮、猪鬃和肠衣又是重要的出口物资。一吨猪肉可换五吨钢材，十二箱猪鬃可换一部拖拉机，一桶猪肠衣可换十一吨多肥田粉。我国农业要实现现代化和机械化，一方面要依靠我们国家自己的工业来装备和支援；另一方面，如果我国养猪事业大大发展起来，生产更多的商品猪出口，就可以更多地换回化学肥料、钢材和拖拉机来，直接支援农业的现代化。
    自从党中央和国务院指示全国农村在今年冬天要开展一个养猪高潮以来，各地养猪事业发展得很快。全国猪只的头数10月份比9月份增加5.4％，11月份又比10月份增加9％。据十五个省（市）部分地区的不完全统计，全国已有三个县六十七个人民公社和四千多个生产队实现了一亩地一头猪。实现一人一猪的地区和单位就更多了。全国每户一头猪，我们早就达到而且超过了。现在，我国人民应该树立雄心大志，要进一步争取在一个不太长的时间内，实现每两人一头猪，而后再争取达到一人一头猪甚至更多一点。
    要实现这样的目标，自然还须作许多艰苦的工作。各地党委首先要政治挂帅，鼓足干劲，大搞群众运动，将养猪工作提到和粮食工作同等重要的地位。猪肥是农作物的粮食，农作物是牲畜的粮食，农作物和牲畜（特别是猪）又都是人类的粮食。正如民歌所说：“养猪好处真是多，好比一箭射三雕，增积肥料保生产，收入加多肉食多”。这样的好事，我们何乐而不为呢？全国广大城乡，除了一些禁猪的少数民族地区以外，都应当动员起来，大养特养其猪，向猪要更多的优质肥料，要更多的肉食。农村中要做到社社队队有猪场，家家户户养肥猪。城市中有条件的工厂、机关、学校都应设法养猪，解决本单位的肉食供应。
    现在，凡是养猪发展快的地方，在贯彻政策、解决资金、饲料、猪源、饲养管理、养猪的工具改革等方面，都创造了很多很好的经验。可以设想，当这些经验更好地传播和推广以后，全国的养猪事业定会更快地发展起来，一个更大的养猪高潮定会在全国广大农村人民公社出现。我国人民一定要下最大的决心，鼓足冲天的干劲，在明年一年中集中力量，加速猪的繁殖，使猪的存栏数大大增加。我们相信，在党的坚强领导下，我们全国大多数人民公社将在若干年内一定能够逐步实现两人一头猪、一人一头猪甚至更多一点，从而使我国发展农业生产所需要的肥料问题和我国人民的肉食问题，从根本上得到解决。
