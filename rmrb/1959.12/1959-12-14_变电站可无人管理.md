The Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a new type of contactless remote control, measurement, and signal integrated equipment this year. This contactless remote control integrated equipment will soon be installed in an unmanned substation.

Experiments have proved that using this equipment, operators can sit in a dispatch room dozens of kilometers away from the substation and send dozens of different instructions to the substation by pressing buttons, enabling the substation to execute commands quickly and accurately. Similarly, through remote measurement and signaling equipment, instruments and signaling devices in the dispatch room can indicate the working status of the substation. In this way, the substation can be unmanned, which is both safe and reliable and can save a lot of maintenance costs and capital construction costs.

Ordinary remote control equipment uses "contact" relays. The so-called "contact" means that there are contact points in the middle of the line. When the line is energized, the contact points are connected, and when the power is off, the contact points are separated. The contact points are easily damaged and require frequent maintenance and adjustment.

    变电站可无人管理
    中国科学院自动化研究所今年研究制成一种新型无触点远距离控制、测量和信号综合设备。这种无触点远动综合设备即将安装在一个无人管理的变电站内。
    试验证明：使用这套设备，操作者只要坐在距离变电站几十公里的调度室里按按电纽就可把数十种不同的指令传到变电站，使变电站迅速而准确地执行命令；同样地，通过远距离测量和信号设备，调度室内仪表和信号装置可以指示出变电站工作状况。这样，变电站内就可以无人管理，既安全可靠而又可节省大量维护费用和基本建设费用。
    一般普通的远动设备，都是用的“有触点”继电器。所谓“有触点”就是线路中间有接触点，线路通电时，接触点就接上，断电时，接触点就分开，接触点容易损坏，需要经常维护和调整。
