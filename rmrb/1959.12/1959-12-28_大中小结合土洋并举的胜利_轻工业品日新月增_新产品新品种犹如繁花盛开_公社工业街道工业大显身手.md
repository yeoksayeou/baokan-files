Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Due to the implementation of the policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale operations and integrating indigenous and foreign methods, China's light industry has experienced significant development this year. According to statistics from the Ministry of Light Industry, the actual output of 45 major products from January to November this year has greatly increased compared to the same period last year. For example, the increase in machine-made paper, edible vegetable oil, sugar, soap, alcohol, thermos bottles, gold pens, cameras, musical instruments, etc., is substantial. Due to the rapid recovery and development of handicraft production, the output of many daily-use handicraft products has also increased significantly.

While the output of light industrial products has increased, the quality is also continuously improving. For example, the newsprint produced by paper mills in Jilin, Shixian, Qiqihar, and other places has a smooth surface, good ink absorption performance, and the rate of qualified products has gradually increased, with some reaching as high as 98%. The physical performance and appearance quality of rubber shoes have also improved. The quality of rubber shoes produced in Tianjin, Shanghai, Changchun, Harbin, and other cities has increased month by month since the second half of the year, and has exceeded the quality standards stipulated by the Ministry of Light Industry. The first-class product rate of thermos bottles increased from 74% in July to 81% in October. The color, gloss, and impact resistance of daily enamelware have been further improved compared to the past.

This year, the number of new products and varieties in the light industry system has greatly increased, blooming like flowers, colorful and brilliant. By November, Shanghai had successfully trial-produced and put into production a total of 2,148 new products and varieties. Guangzhou has trial-produced and put into production more than 1,600 new products and varieties. Tianjin has put into production a total of more than 1,400 new products and varieties. A large number of new products and varieties have also emerged in other places. The main new products produced in various regions this year include: giant clocks for the Beijing Railway Station, five-meter football clocks for the Workers' Stadium, Chenguang cameras, 17-jewel women's watches, universal sewing machines, Model 81 road racing bicycles, analog electronic computers, color positive films, spectroscopic photographic plates, movable movie screens, widescreen screens, color films, 660,000-volt cable paper, yellow wax silk paper, phlogopite paper, asbestos felt base paper, artificial gemstones, high-grade ballpoint pens, filter cigarettes, 15,000-liter acid-resistant tanks, glass acid-resistant pumps, quartz glass, etc. There are also many new varieties of canned food, ceramics, optical glass, special handicrafts, and so on. Many of these new products and varieties are products that China has never produced before.

The important reason why China's light industry has achieved brilliant achievements this year on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 is that, under the great call and encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the vast number of light industry workers across the country opposed right-leaning tendencies and boosted their morale, launched a magnificent production increase and economy campaign centered on "high output, high quality, low consumption, multiple varieties, and safe production," and carried out large-scale technical innovations and technical revolutions. They have made great achievements in improving equipment and tools, improving production technology and operation methods, increasing labor productivity, and saving raw materials. For example, in the paper industry, the production capacity of round-net single-cylinder paper machines has been improved through technological innovation. Some paper mills in Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chengdu have adopted measures such as strong ventilation, increasing the line pressure of pressure rollers and idler rollers, and increasing the dehydration effect of wet paper, which greatly accelerated the drying power of the drying cylinder, making the daily output of this type of paper machine 40% to 100% higher than before. In terms of the daily-use machinery industry, the North China Sewing Machine Factory created a "tooth-fork integrated machine tool," which combines twelve processes into one and can replace eight machine tools, increasing production efficiency by fifteen times. Another new creation in this area is the use of indigenous iron to replace foreign iron in the production of sewing machine parts, saving a large amount of good iron while ensuring product quality. The Shanghai Bicycle Factory successfully trial-produced a large-scale automatic combined electroplating machine, which reduces the original fourteen-step process to just one step, increasing production efficiency by four times and greatly saving electricity, steam, and water consumption, giving the electroplating production a new look. In the ceramics and glass industry, various mechanized and semi-automated equipment have been created using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, especially the successful trial of coal gas firing in various kiln types, laying the foundation for the comprehensive realization of gasification.

Resolutely implementing the policy of walking on two legs, combining large, medium, and small-scale operations and integrating indigenous and foreign methods, not only fully utilized the production potential of large and foreign enterprises, but also enabled small and indigenous enterprises to play an important role in realizing the overall leap forward in light industry. In the first half of this year, the street-run civil industries in cities and the people's commune industries in rural areas across the country, after rectification and improvement, continued to develop in the second half of the year, and have shown their strength in supporting agriculture, utilizing local resources, and meeting social needs. For example, most of the more than 900 small indigenous and small foreign paper mills built across the country from last year to October this year have gradually entered normal production after being put into operation. The production capacity of these small paper mills is equivalent to about 20% of the production capacity of the newly built large paper mills during China's first five-year plan period, saving a large amount of investment and steel materials for the country. This year, more than 2,000 small sugar mills have been established in various places, ensuring the processing of sugar materials in new sugar producing areas. The development of small alcohol factories is also very rapid. At present, alcohol produced by indigenous methods accounts for about 45% of the total national alcohol production. Other small factories such as those for oils and fats, starch, dairy products, fruit processing, ceramics, and shoemaking have also made great progress. (Attached picture)

　　大中小结合土洋并举的胜利
    轻工业品日新月增
    新产品新品种犹如繁花盛开  公社工业街道工业大显身手
    新华社27日讯　由于贯彻大中小结合土洋并举的方针，我国轻工业今年又有巨大发展。据轻工业部统计，四十五种主要产品今年1至11月份的实际产量都比去年同期有很大增长。如机制纸、食用植物油、食糖、肥皂、酒精、热水瓶、金笔、照相机、乐器等增长的幅度都相当大。因为手工业生产的迅速恢复和发展，许多日用手工业品的产量也大大增加。
    在轻工业品产量增加的同时，质量也在不断提高。例如吉林、石岘、齐齐哈尔等造纸厂生产的新闻纸，纸面平滑，吸墨性能好，合格率逐步上升，有的高达98％。胶鞋的物理性能和外观质量都有提高。天津、上海、长春、哈尔滨等市产的胶鞋，下半年来质量逐月上升，已经超过了轻工业部规定的质量标准；热水瓶的一级品率，由7月份的74％提高到10月份的81％；日用搪瓷品的颜色、光泽度、耐冲击力都比过去进一步提高了。
    今年，轻工业系统的新产品和新品种大大增加，犹如繁花盛开，绚丽多彩。到11月，上海试制成功已投入生产的新产品和新品种共达二千一百四十八种。广州市试制出的新产品和新品种已投入生产的有一千六百余种。天津市已投入生产的新产品和新品种共一千四百多种。其他各地也涌现出大量新的产品和品种。各地今年生产的比较主要的新产品有：北京火车站用的巨型时钟、工人体育场五米足球钟、晨光照相机、十七钻女式手表、万能缝纫机、八十一型公路赛车、模拟式电子计算机、彩色电影正片、光谱感光板、活动电影银幕、宽银幕屏、彩色胶卷、六十六万伏电缆纸、黄蜡绸纸、粉云母纸、石棉油毡原纸、人造宝石、高级圆珠笔、过滤嘴烟、一万五千公升耐酸罐、玻璃耐酸泵、石英玻璃等等，其他如罐头、陶瓷、光学玻璃、特种工艺品等的新品种也很多。这些新产品和新品种中，许多都是我国过去没有生产过的。
    我国轻工业在1958年大跃进的基础上，今年又取得辉煌成就的重要原因是，全国轻工业广大职工在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召与鼓舞下，反右倾鼓干劲，开展了波澜壮阔的“高产、优质、低耗、多品种、安全生产”为中心的增产节约运动，大搞技术革新和技术革命，在改进设备工具、改善生产工艺和操作方法、提高劳动生产率和节约原料材料等方面，作出了巨大成绩。例如：造纸工业方面，通过革新技术，提高了圆网单缸造纸机的生产能力。天津、上海、成都有些纸厂采取强力通风、提高压辊、托辊的线压力，增加湿纸脱水效果等措施，大大加速了烘缸的干燥力，使这种纸机日产量比原来提高40％至一倍。日用机械工业方面，华北缝纫机厂创造出“牙义综合机床”，把十二道工序合成一道，可以代替八台机床，提高生产效率十五倍。这一方面的另一新创造，是用土铁代替洋铁生产缝纫机零件，节约大量好铁，产品质量也能保证。上海自行车厂试制成功了大型自动联合电镀机，使原来要经过十四道工序的工作，现在只需要一道工序就完成了，提高生产效率四倍，并且大大节省了电、蒸气和水的消耗，使电镀生产面貌焕然一新。陶瓷、玻璃工业方面，已用土、洋结合的方法创造了各种机械化、半自动化的设备，尤其是在各种窑型上改烧煤气试验成功，为全面实现煤气化打下基础。
    坚决贯彻大中小并举、土洋并举的两条腿走路方针，既努力发挥了大洋企业的生产潜力，又使小土企业在实现轻工业全面跃进中起了重要作用。今年上半年，全国各地城市的街道民办工业和农村的人民公社工业经过整顿和提高，下半年继续发展，在支援农业、利用当地资源、满足社会需要等方面都已经显示出它的力量。如去年至今年10月全国建成的九百多个小土群、小洋群的造纸厂，相继投入生产后，大多数厂生产已趋正常。这部分小纸厂的生产能力，相当于我国第一个五年计划时期新建大型纸厂生产能力的20％左右。为国家节省了大量投资和钢铁材料。今年各地又兴办了二千多个小型糖厂。保证了新产糖区的糖料加工。小型酒精厂发展也很快，目前用土法生产的酒精占到全国酒精总产量的45％左右。其他如小型的油脂、淀粉、乳品、果类加工、陶瓷、制鞋等工厂，也都有很大发展。（附图片）
