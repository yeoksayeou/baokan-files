Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 20th: The first group of Korean residents in Japan who returned to the homeland arrived in Pyongyang by train today from Chongjin. Having just received a large-scale and warm welcome at Chongjin Port, they were once again greeted by relatives in the democratic capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Those who came to the station to welcome them included Vice Premiers of the Cabinet of Korea, Jung Il-ryong and Li Zhouyuan, Foreign Minister Park Sung-chul, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross, Li Il-kyung, and responsible persons of Korean party, government and social organizations, responsible persons of the Pyongyang city party and government, and 150,000 people from Pyongyang.

The scene at the station was deeply moving. Today, the Pyongyang station was decorated with flowers and clusters, with a portrait of Premier Kim Il-sung hanging high and huge slogans welcoming the return of Korean residents in Japan. When the first train carrying Korean residents in Japan slowly entered Pyongyang Station a little after 1 p.m., dense layers of colored paper tape fluttered, and thunderous cheers erupted. When the representatives of the first group of returning Korean residents in Japan, Li Shunying, Cui Bingshi, and other returning residents walked out of the station building, thousands of pairs of enthusiastic hands of the welcoming masses in the square in front of the station raised bouquets and cheered them. The Korean residents in Japan, who had just thrown themselves into the embrace of their long-missed motherland, also cheered with the welcomers. (Attached picture)

　　首批旅日朝侨回到平壤
    受到平壤十五万人热烈欢迎
    新华社平壤20日电　由日本归国的第一批旅日朝侨今天从清津乘火车到达平壤。刚刚在清津港受过大规模热烈欢迎的他们，今天在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国民主首都，又一次受到亲人的亲切的欢迎。
    到车站欢迎的有朝鲜内阁副首相郑一龙、李周渊，外务相朴成哲，朝鲜红十字会中央委员会副委员长李一卿和朝鲜党政社会团体的负责人，平壤市的党政负责人，以及平壤市人民共十五万人。
    车站上是一片感动人的景象。今天平壤车站打扮得花团锦簇，高悬着金日成首相的画像和欢迎旅日朝侨归来的巨幅标语。下午一点多钟，载运旅日朝侨的第一列火车徐徐驶进平壤站时，密密层层的彩色纸带在飘拂，顿时响起了雷鸣般的欢呼声。当第一批归国的旅日朝侨代表李舜英、崔秉植和其他归侨走出车站大楼的时候，车站前广场上的欢迎群众的千万双热情的手高举着花束，向他们欢呼。刚刚投进他们多年思念的祖国的怀抱的旅日朝侨们也同欢迎者一同欢呼。（附图片）
