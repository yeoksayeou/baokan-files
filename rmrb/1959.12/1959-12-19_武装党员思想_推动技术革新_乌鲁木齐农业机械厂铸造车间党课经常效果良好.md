　　Arming Party Members' Minds, Promoting Technological Innovation
　　Urumqi Agricultural Machinery Factory's Foundry Workshop Party Class Achieves Consistently Good Results
　　(Our dispatch) The Party School of the Foundry Workshop of Urumqi Agricultural Machinery Factory in Xinjiang conducts lively and effective Party lessons for its employees, combining the specific circumstances of the factory and the workshop. The political awareness of the students participating in the study has been continuously improved, and their enthusiasm for production is consistently high, promoting the technological innovation movement in the workshop. In less than a year since the opening of the Party School, workers have put forward 49,120 rationalization proposals, of which more than 19,000 have been put into effect in production, enabling the workshop to complete two years' worth of production tasks in one year.
　　The Foundry Workshop of Urumqi Agricultural Machinery Factory is a newly developed large workshop. The workshop has a total of more than 900 employees, of which more than 70% are new workers. In order to ensure that ideological education keeps pace with production development, the workshop Party branch, under the unified arrangement of the factory Party committee, established the workshop Party School in February of this year. In addition to the 32 Party members in the workshop, the Party School also absorbed 42 veteran workers and young activists to attend Party classes. The branch committee members personally serve as Party class teachers, and teachers from the factory Party committee and the Autonomous Region Party School are invited to give lectures in rotation, ensuring that the teachers of each subject are basically fixed. Class time must not be arbitrarily occupied, and in case of special circumstances, make-up classes must be held afterwards.
　　In order to improve the political awareness of the students and promote production, the content of the Party class is closely linked to the ideological and production reality of the factory and the workshop. There are many new workers in this workshop, their level of awareness is low, and many people have conservative ideas, making it difficult to carry out technological innovation. The Party branch analyzed and studied this situation and added it to the lecture outline, making the lectures vivid and specific, which was very enlightening for the students. For example, the workers in the model group had always believed that models could only be manufactured manually and could not be mechanized. Based on this idea, the Party branch combined it with the lesson on "Subjective Initiative" and explained the principle of "Everything depends on human effort" from a theoretical perspective, and cited many real people and events of technological innovation in the factory and the workshop during the Great Leap Forward to illustrate the scientific principle of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, which increased the students' confidence in breaking superstitions and overcoming difficulties. After listening to the Party class, the workers in the model group launched a discussion on the topic of "Can innovation be carried out?". Many people combined it with the production in the group to criticize their own superstitious and conservative ideas, and set a goal of achieving semi-mechanization of all processes in the group within five months. After everyone's hard work, overcoming the difficulty of rudimentary equipment, they created indigenous sawing machines, indigenous planers, cutting machines, polishing machines, etc. in a very short period of time, fully realizing mechanization, and increasing work efficiency by more than three times, with the highest reaching thirty times.
　　When teaching about the vanguard role of the Party, the Party School linked it to the issue of establishing pacesetters in the workshop, and explained the vanguard role of Party members and how they should take the lead in the movement. After studying and discussing, all Party members in the workshop actively participated in the competition to learn from pacesetters and catch up with the advanced. Yang Zhemin, the Party member group leader of the molding group, led all the workers in the group to tap potential, think of ways, and take the lead in working hard, breaking through the technical barrier of replacing cast iron with native iron, and production increased sharply, completing four years' worth of tasks in one year. Now, the whole group has entered 1964 and has become a pacesetter in the machinery industry of the Autonomous Region. All six pacesetters in the workshop are Party members. Non-Party activists have also greatly improved their class consciousness through Party class education. Many people have submitted applications to the Party branch to join the Party, and they are also more active in production. In addition to actively thinking of ways to innovate technologically, they also regard training new workers as their own responsibility. After a day of intense labor, they use their evening rest time to organize amateur technical training classes and enthusiastically pass on their skills to apprentices. In half a year, 54 apprentices have reached the third grade.
　　Through learning, Party school students have become assistants to the Party branch in educating workers. They help new workers improve their ideological awareness and pass on their skills to them; when new workers encounter difficulties in their lives, Party members and activists help them solve them with a spirit of love and mutual assistance. With the help of Party members and veteran workers, the awareness of new workers has improved rapidly, and bad phenomena such as lateness and early departure have been eliminated. In their work, they have also established a sense of ownership.

　　武装党员思想　推动技术革新
    乌鲁木齐农业机械厂铸造车间党课经常效果良好
    本报讯　新疆乌鲁木齐农业机械厂铸造车间党校，结合本工厂和车间的具体情况，向职工进行生动活泼的党课教育。参加学习的学员政治觉悟不断提高，生产热情经常饱满，推动了车间生产技术革新运动。开办党校不到一年，工人提出的合理化建议达四万九千一百二十条，其中一万九千多件，已在生产中发挥效用，使车间一年完成两年的生产任务。
    乌鲁木齐农业机械厂铸造车间，是一个新发展起来的大车间。这个车间共有职工九百余人，新工人占70％以上。车间党支部为了使思想教育工作跟上生产发展，在工厂党委统一安排下，今年2月间创办了车间党校。党校除车间的三十二名党员参加外，还吸收了四十二名老工人和青年积极分子听党课。党课教员由支委亲自担任，并聘请工厂党委和自治区党校教员，轮流讲课，做到各科教员基本上固定。上课时间不得任意占用，遇有特殊情况，事后也要补课。
    为了提高学员的政治觉悟，推动生产，党课内容紧密联系本厂、本车间的思想和生产实际。这个车间的新工人多，觉悟水平较低，不少人有保守思想，技术革新开展不起来。党支部分析研究了这一情况，并把它补充到讲课提纲中去，使讲课生动具体，对学员启发很大。如模型组工人，过去一直认为模型只能手工制造，无法机械化。党支部便根据这种思想，结合“主观能动性”一课，从理论上讲解了“事在人为”的道理，并列举本工厂、本车间在大跃进中许多技术革新的真人真事，说明敢想、敢说、敢干的科学道理，增加了学员破除迷信、克服困难的信心。模型组工人听了党课以后，以“能不能革新”为题，展开了讨论。许多人结合组内生产批判了自己的迷信保守思想，并订出全组各项工序在五个月内实现半机械化的奋斗目标。经过大家苦钻苦干，克服了设备简陋的困难，在很短的时间内就创造出土锯床、土刨床、切头机、磨光机等机器，全面实现了机械化，工效提高三倍以上，最高的达三十倍。
    党校在讲授党的先锋队作用时，便联系到本车间树立标兵的问题，讲述了党员的先锋作用和应该如何在运动中带头。经过学习和讨论以后，车间的所有党员都踊跃参加了学标兵、赶先进的竞赛运动。造型组党员组长杨哲民领导全组工人挖潜力，想办法，带头苦干，突破了以土铁代铸铁的技术关，生产猛增，一年完成了四年的任务。现在，全组已经跨进1964年，成为自治区机械工业的一支标兵。全车间六个标兵都是党员。非党积极分子通过党课教育，阶级觉悟也有了很大提高。许多人向党支部提出了入党申请，在生产上也更积极了。他们除了在技术革新上主动想办法，并把培养新工人当作自己份内的事情。在一天紧张劳动之后，他们利用晚上休息时间组织业余技术训练班，热情向徒工传授技术。半年中，使五十四名徒工达到了三级工。
    党校学员通过学习，成了党支部教育工人的助手。他们帮助新工人提高思想觉悟，并向他们传授技术；遇到新工人的生活上发生困难，党员和积极分子便以友爱互助的精神帮助他们解决。新工人经过党员和老工人的帮助，觉悟提高很快，迟到、早退等不良现象消灭了，在工作上，也树立了主人翁思想。
