Fighting Drought Until the Heavens Bow Their Heads, Protecting Seedlings Until the Grain Enters the Granary
Jiangsu Overcomes the Worst Drought in Thirty Years
More Than 20 Million Mu Increased Production, 5 Million Mu Protected Production, 5 Million Mu Reduced Production

Nanjing, December 5th (reporting from this newspaper) Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the 40 million people of Jiangsu Province, relying on the magnificent strength of the People's Communes, have overcome the worst drought in thirty years. Of the province's more than 30 million mu of early, mid, and late rice, with the exception of a few areas where the drought was particularly severe and some mid-season rice yields were slightly reduced, widespread good harvests were achieved.

This autumn, Jiangsu encountered the worst drought in thirty years. The drought lasted for more than sixty days in general, and as long as one hundred and eighty days in the Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Nanjing mountainous areas. The drought-affected area in the province reached more than 20 million mu, accounting for about one-half of the total area of autumn-harvested crops. July and August were the key periods for increasing rice production, with more than 19 million mu of mid-season rice in the heading and filling stage, and 7.6 million mu of double-season and single-season late rice in the regreening and tillering stages, all of which required sufficient moisture. However, during this period, the average rainfall in the province was only about 30 millimeters. According to historical data from the provincial water conservancy department, this was about 70% less than the rainfall during the same period in the historically severe droughts of 1929 (northern Jiangsu) and 1934 (southern Jiangsu). Throughout the autumn, Jiangsu was under the control of a tropical high-pressure system, resulting in unprecedented heat not seen in thirty years. The average daily evaporation rate in the province was about 20 millimeters. Jiangsu's two major water sources—the Yangtze River and the Huai River—also experienced the same low water levels as in the driest years in history (1928 for the Yangtze River and 1936 for the Huai River) due to the decreasing flow of water from the upper reaches. Due to prolonged drought and high evaporation, the water storage capacity of inland ponds and ditches gradually decreased. By mid-August, half of the more than 500,000 ponds and reservoirs in the mountainous areas of the province had dried up completely. This drought situation posed a great threat to the growth of rice, especially mid-season and late rice.

The severe drought did not shake the determination of the people of Jiangsu to strive for a good autumn harvest. With the tenacious will of "Man can conquer nature," the 40 million people put forward the slogans "Fight drought until the heavens bow their heads, protect seedlings until the grain enters the granary" and "Drought to the ends of the earth, fight to the ends of the earth," and declared war on the drought demon. Responsible cadres of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels always stood at the forefront of the drought resistance movement, leading the masses in a sustained struggle against the severe drought. According to the requirements put forward by the Provincial Party Committee at the end of July that drought-stricken areas should strive not to reduce production or to increase production as much as possible; areas with light drought should strive to increase production by 10% to 20%; and areas basically unaffected by drought should strive to increase production by 20% to 30% or 30% to 40%, specific targets for drought resistance and yield protection were set, and a vigorous production increase competition movement was launched, pushing the drought resistance struggle to a new climax.

In the struggle against the sustained and severe drought, the People's Communes demonstrated their magnificent strength. According to the degree of drought, the People's Communes uniformly adjusted their drought resistance forces. Young and strong people participated in digging canals, building dams, and operating waterwheels; those who knew how to operate machines managed the water pumping machines; experienced old farmers were responsible for irrigation water; and older commune members cooked meals and took care of children at home. Blacksmiths and carpenters organized into repair teams to go deep into the fields to repair water-lifting tools. In order to solve the increasingly serious difficulties in irrigation water, the People's Communes adopted various practical and effective measures. Areas along the Yangtze River strengthened the control of sluice gates along the river to divert and store tidal water. The Taihu, Lixiahe, and electromechanical irrigation areas implemented planned water use and saved water. In the hilly and mountainous areas where water sources were extremely scarce, the People's Communes organized labor to dig channels across mountains and ridges, erected waterwheels, and diverted water from rivers and lakes several or even a dozen miles away to rescue drought-stricken rice seedlings. In the drought resistance struggle, urban organizations, factories, schools, hospitals, stores, and People's Liberation Army garrison troops supported the rural drought resistance struggle with more and more strength.

After more than one hundred days of tenacious struggle by the people of the entire province, Jiangsu's drought resistance struggle finally achieved a great victory. Now, all of the province's more than 30 million mu of rice have been harvested. According to preliminary statistics, more than 20 million mu have achieved a good harvest, generally increasing production by more than 10% compared with last year, and some areas have increased production by 20%, 30%, or even more than 40%. Five million mu were protected. Only five million mu experienced reduced production (mainly mid-season rice), of which 2.5 million mu were reduced by 10% to 20%, 1.8 million mu were reduced by 30% to 50%, and 700,000 mu yielded nothing. The areas with a relatively large reduction in production were mainly some communes in the Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Nanjing mountainous areas that had been drought-stricken for more than 180 days.

In order to make up for the losses caused by the drought, various localities have planted a large number of late autumn crops such as buckwheat, carrots, and vegetables this year. At the same time, in accordance with the spirit of the provincial Party Committee's instruction to "live frugally even in prosperous times," they have vigorously promoted sideline production and the planned use and conservation of grain, so as to better arrange the people's lives this winter and next spring.

    抗旱抗到天低头　保苗保到粮进仓
    江苏战胜三十年来最大一次干旱
    二千多万亩增产，五百万亩保产，五百万亩减产
    本报南京5日电　江苏省四千万人民在各级党委的领导下，依靠人民公社的雄伟力量，战胜了三十年来最大的一次干旱。全省三千多万亩早、中、晚稻，除了少数地区因干旱特别严重，部分中稻稍有减产外，普遍获得了丰收。
    今年秋季，江苏遇到了三十年来最大的一次干旱。干旱时间一般在六十多天，镇（江）扬（州）宁（南京）山区干旱时间长达一百八十多天。全省受旱面积达二千多万亩，占秋收作物总面积二分之一左右。7、8两月，正是水稻增产的关键时期，全省一千九百多万亩中稻正在抽穗灌浆，七百六十万亩双季、单季晚稻正在返青阶段和分蘖盛期，都需要充足的水分。但是，在这期间，全省平均降雨量只有三十毫米左右，据省水利部门的历史资料记载，比历史上特大干旱的1929年（苏北）、1934年（苏南）的同期降雨量还少70％左右。整个秋季，江苏一直处在热带高压控制下，出现了三十年没有的奇热。全省每日平均蒸发量在20毫米左右。江苏的两条大水源——长江与淮河由于上游来水量日渐减少，也出现了与历史上最旱年（长江是1928年，淮河是1936年）相同的枯水位。由于久旱少雨和蒸发量大，内地塘沟水库存水量日见减少，8月中旬全省山区的五十多万个塘沟水库有一半干涸见底。这样的干旱情况对水稻尤其是中、晚稻的生长威胁很大。
    严重的干旱动摇不了江苏人民争取秋熟丰收的决心，四千万人民以“人定胜天”的顽强意志，提出了“抗旱抗到天低头、保苗保到粮进仓”、“旱到天边、抗到天边”的口号，向旱魔大宣战。江苏省委和各级党委负责干部始终站在抗旱运动的最前列，领导群众与严重干旱作持久斗争。各级党委根据省委7月底提出的干旱严重的地区，力争不减产或多收一些；干旱轻的地区，力争超产一、二成；基本不受旱的地区，力争超产二、三成或三、四成的要求，订出了分类抗旱保丰收的具体指标，开展了轰轰烈烈的超产竞赛运动，把抗旱斗争推向更高潮。
    在与持久的严重干旱作斗争中，人民公社显示了雄伟力量。各人民公社根据受旱程度，统一调整了抗旱力量，年轻力壮的参加开渠、打坝、车水，会开机器的管戽水机，有经验的老农负责灌溉用水，年纪大的社员在家里烧饭、带孩子，铁匠、木匠组织成修配小组，深入田头抢修提水工具。为了解决越来越严重的灌溉用水困难，人民公社采取了各种切实有效的措施。长江两岸地区加强沿江涵闸的控制，引蓄潮水，太湖、里下河地区和机电灌溉区，实行了计划用水，节约用水。在水源十分缺乏的丘陵山区，人民公社组织劳力翻山越岭挖渠道，架起一道道水车，把几里、十几里路以外的江湖河水引来抢救受旱禾苗。在抗旱斗争中，城市的机关、工厂、学校、医院、商店和人民解放军驻军部队，以越来越多的力量支援农村的抗旱斗争。
    江苏抗旱斗争，经过全省人民一百多天的顽强奋战，终于取得了巨大的胜利。现在，全省三千多万亩水稻已全部收获结束，据初步统计，有二千多万亩获得了丰收，一般比去年增产一成以上，有些地区增产二成、三成以至四成以上。有五百万亩保收。减产的只有五百万亩（主要是中稻），其中减产一成到二成的有二百五十万亩，减产三成到五成的有一百八十万亩，七十万亩无收。减产成数较多的主要是受旱一百八十多天的镇、扬、宁山区的一部分公社。
    为了弥补干旱所受的损失，各地今年抗旱抢种了大批荞麦、胡萝卜和蔬菜等晚秋作物，同时根据省委提出的“富日子当穷日子过”的指示精神，大抓副业生产，大抓计划用粮、节约用粮工作，更好地安排今冬明春的人民生活。
