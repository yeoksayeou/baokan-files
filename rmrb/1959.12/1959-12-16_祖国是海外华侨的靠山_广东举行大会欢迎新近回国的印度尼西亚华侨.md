Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 15th: The Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission held a meeting on the 14th to welcome newly returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia to Guangzhou. Wu Feng, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, expressed deep concern and sympathy at the meeting for the persecuted overseas Chinese in Indonesia. He also warmly welcomed those compatriots who have been persecuted and displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue living in Indonesia to return to the motherland to participate in the great socialist construction.

Wu Feng said that the people's communes and overseas Chinese farms in various overseas Chinese hometowns in Guangdong, as well as other relevant production and construction departments, the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Supplementary Middle School, and other schools at all levels, are all preparing to welcome overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese students returning to the motherland.

Huang Sheng, Director of the Office of the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, introduced the recent situation of receiving and resettling returned overseas Chinese in the past six months at the meeting.

He said that more than 4,800 returned overseas Chinese have returned to Guangdong in the past six months, more than 2,600 have been resettled in overseas Chinese farms and industrial and transportation departments, more than 1,000 have been resettled in their hometowns to participate in production and construction, and more than 800 children of overseas Chinese employees have been resettled in schools. The more than 200 people who have recently returned to China will also be properly resettled soon. This fully shows that the motherland is the backing of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese are no longer "overseas orphans."

Overseas Chinese who have recently returned from Indonesia also spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the motherland, expressed their strong support for the three-point proposal put forward by our government for a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese issue in Indonesia, and exposed the crazy anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia. Liang Huaxin, who returned from West Java and Bandung, said that the anti-Chinese activities in West Java are the most brutal, even near Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. In Cibinong, more than 30 overseas Chinese households were suddenly surrounded by more than ten military trucks with armed police on one day in November, as if facing a formidable enemy, and were forced to move out. In this area, incidents of beatings, shootings, and injuries have occurred many times during the persecution of overseas Chinese, which has not only aroused great indignation among the broad masses of overseas Chinese, but also caused unease and dissatisfaction among the local people.

An overseas Chinese from Makassar said that the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia were instigated by imperialist conspiracies, and some influential forces in Indonesia treated enemies as friends and friends as enemies. For thousands of years, overseas Chinese and local people have worked together to contribute to the economic and cultural development of Indonesia. Now they are being subjected to extremely brutal persecution, and we cannot but express our indignation. The Indonesian government should immediately stop the anti-Chinese activities!

Lin Xiuhan, a returned overseas Chinese from West Kalimantan, said that the three-point proposal put forward by our government for a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese issue existing between China and Indonesia is fair and reasonable. She demanded that the Indonesian government respect the wishes of those overseas Chinese who have been forced to become displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia, allow them to sell their property and take back the funds they have obtained, and send them back to China in batches and stages.

### 祖国是海外华侨的靠山  广东举行大会欢迎新近回国的印度尼西亚华侨

    祖国是海外华侨的靠山
    广东举行大会欢迎新近回国的印度尼西亚华侨
    新华社广州15日电　广东省华侨事务委员会14日举行大会，欢迎新近回到广州的印度尼西亚归国华侨。广东省华侨事务委员会副主任吴风在会上对遭受迫害的印度尼西亚华侨表示深切的关怀和慰问，他还表示热烈欢迎那些受到迫害而流离失所、无法谋生或者不愿继续留居在印度尼西亚的侨胞回到祖国来参加伟大的社会主义建设。
    吴风说，广东各个侨乡的人民公社和华侨农场以及其他有关的生产建设部门、广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校和其他各级学校，都在准备欢迎返回祖国的华侨和华侨学生。
    广东省华侨事务委员会办公室主任黄声在大会上向新近归国的华侨介绍了最近半年来接待和安置归侨的情况。
    他说，最近半年来回到广东的归国华侨有四千八百多人，安置到华侨农场和工矿交通部门的有二千六百多人，安置到原籍参加生产建设的有一千多人，安置就学的华侨职工子弟有八百多人，最近回国的二百多人不久也可得到妥善安置。这充分说明祖国是华侨的靠山，华侨再也不是“海外孤儿”了。
    新从印度尼西亚归来的华侨也在会上讲了话。他们在讲话中表达了对祖国的衷心感激，表示热烈支持我国政府提出的全面解决印度尼西亚华侨问题的三点建议，并且揭露了印度尼西亚的疯狂的排华活动。从西爪哇、万隆归来的梁华新说，西爪哇地区的排华活动是最残暴的，即使在印度尼西亚首都雅加达附近也不例外。在芝槟榔地方有三十多户华侨，11月的一天，突然开来十多部军用卡车，军警荷枪实弹，如临大敌，包围了华侨小商贩的房屋，迫令迁走。这个地区在迫害华侨时多次发生了殴打、开枪射击、伤人流血事件，不但激起了广大华侨的极大愤慨，也引起了当地人民的不安和不满。
    一位来自锡江的华侨说，印度尼西亚排华是帝国主义阴谋策动的，印度尼西亚一些有影响的势力以敌为友，以友为敌。千百年来，华侨和当地人民一起，对印度尼西亚经济、文化的发展尽力作出了贡献。现在竟然受到极其粗暴的迫害，我们不能不表示愤慨。印度尼西亚政府应该立即制止排华活动！
    西加里曼丹归侨林秀汉说，我国政府提出了全面解决存在于中国和印度尼西亚两国间的华侨问题的三点建议，是公平合理的。她要求印度尼西亚政府对于那些被迫得流离失所、无法谋生或者不愿意继续居留在印度尼西亚的华侨，尊重他们的志愿，允许他们变卖自己的产业并带回所得的资金，分期分批遣送他们回国。
