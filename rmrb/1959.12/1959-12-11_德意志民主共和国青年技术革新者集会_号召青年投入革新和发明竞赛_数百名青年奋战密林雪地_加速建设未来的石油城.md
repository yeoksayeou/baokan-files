Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch: The German Democratic Republic's nine hundred youth technological innovators, rationalization proposers, and inventors held a meeting in Leipzig from December 1st to 3rd to discuss how young people can improve technology and better complete the Seven-Year Plan. After the meeting, a communique was issued calling on youth across the country to actively participate in innovation and invention competitions.

    The meeting was opened by Apel, Director of the Economic Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. He said that the innovation groups now established by the trade union committees must pay serious attention to the suggestions put forward by young rationalization proposers and inventors and must give young technical experts more encouragement. He asked factory managers to hold regular meetings with these young people and maintain close contact with them.

    He said that in the first half of 1959, workers across the country had already put forward 203,600 innovation proposals, saving the country 230 million marks. In the same period last year, 145,000 innovation proposals were put forward, saving 175.5 million marks.

    Speeches by representatives at the meeting showed that young technological innovators, rationalization proposers, and inventors have actively put forward various rationalization proposals in production and have achieved success. For example, young workers in Leuna put forward two hundred and forty-five more proposals in July and August this year than in the same period last year. The implementation of these proposals can save 350,000 marks. The Neptune Shipyard in Rostock now takes three hundred and fifty days to build a three-thousand-ton cargo ship, and young workers plan to reduce this period to one hundred and fifty days through technical reforms and improved work organization.

    The communique issued at the meeting called on all young workers to do their best to find the most modern scientific and technological methods and participate in the socialist innovation and invention competition. The communique also called for the inclusion of all young workers and technical experts in the socialist labor team movement.

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th: More than a thousand socialist builders from all over the German Democratic Republic are enthusiastically working in the snow-covered forest area on the banks of the Oder River. They are actively preparing for the large-scale construction of the Schwedt Oil Refinery, the future oil city, next year.

    This refinery is one of the key projects of the German Democratic Republic's Seven-Year Plan. It will be built in the small town of Schwedt on the Oder River, northeast of the Frankfurt district. When completed, large amounts of crude oil will continuously flow from the Soviet Union through a large oil pipeline with a diameter of half a meter that crosses Poland and passes under the Oder River to this refinery.

    The refinery covers an area of ​​more than sixteen square kilometers, and the factory equipment will be the most modern. The entire refinery project is divided into three phases. When completed in 1970, the annual processing volume of petroleum will reach eight million tons. In addition to refining various petroleum products, it will also provide a large amount of raw materials for the chemical industry, thereby transforming the German Democratic Republic's chemical industry from its current lignite-based to a lignite and petroleum-based one.

    The foundation project of the refinery began in March this year. After half a year of hard work by the builders, a large area of ​​open space has now appeared in the dense forest, and the first batch of oil depot steel frames has been installed.

    Young people are playing a significant role in the construction of this factory. The Free German Youth League has declared this project a "youth construction project." The young men and women, who make up half of the builders, actively participate in labor competitions, political studies, and recreational activities under the leadership of the Free German Youth League.

    新华社柏林电　德意志民主共和国九百名青年技术革新者、合理化建议者和发明家12月1日到3日在来比锡举行会议，讨论青年们如何改进技术，更好地完成七年计划的问题。会后并发表了一项公报，号召全国青年积极参加革新和发明的竞赛。
    会议由德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局经济委员会主任阿佩耳主持开幕。他说，各工会委员会现在成立的革新小组必须认真注意青年合理化建议者和发明者所提的建议，必须给予青年技术专家以更多的鼓励。他要求工厂经理经常同这些青年人举行会议，同他们保持密切的接触。
    他说，在1959年上半年，全国各地工人已经提出了二十万零三千六百条革新建议，为国家节省了二亿三千万马克的资金。而去年同一时期，提出的革新建议为十四万五千条，节约资金一亿七千五百五十万马克。
    代表们在会上的发言表明，青年技术革新者、合理化建议者和发明家在生产中积极提出了各种合理化建议，并已取得了成就。如洛伊纳的青年工人在今年7、8月份里提出的建议比去年同期多二百四十五条。这些建议实施后可以节约三十五万马克资金。罗斯托克的海王星造船厂现在造一艘三千吨的货船需要三百五十天，青年工人打算通过技术改革和改进工作组织，把这个期限减少到一百五十天。
    会议发表的公报呼吁全体青年工人尽力寻找最现代化的科学技术方法，参加社会主义革新和发明竞赛。公报还要求吸收全体青年工人和技术专家参加社会主义劳动队运动。
    新华社柏林9日电　一千多名来自德意志民主共和国各地的社会主义建设者正在奥得河畔满复白雪的林区中热情地劳动着。他们为未来的石油城施韦特炼油厂明年的大规模施工积极进行准备。
    这个炼油厂是德意志民主共和国七年计划的骨干工程之一。它将建立在法兰克福专区东北、奥得河畔的施韦特小城中。建成时，大量的原油将源源不断地从苏联经过横贯波兰的一条直径为半米的大油管，穿过奥得河底，流到这个炼油厂。
    炼油厂占地十六平方公里以上，工厂设备将是最现代化的。炼油厂全部工程分三期进行，到1970年全部建成后，每年处理石油量将达八百万吨。它除提炼各种石油产品外，还将为化学工业提供大量原料，从而使德意志民主共和国的化学工业从目前的以褐煤为基础转变为以褐煤和石油为基础。
    炼油厂的奠基工程是今年3月开始的。经过建设者们的半年苦战，现在，密林中已出现了大片平地，第一批油库钢架已经安装起来。
    青年在这个工厂的兴建工程中起着显著作用。自由德国青年联盟已将这个工程宣布为“青年建设项目”。占建设者的半数的青年男女，在自由德国青年联盟的领导下，积极参加劳动竞赛、政治学习和文娱活动。
