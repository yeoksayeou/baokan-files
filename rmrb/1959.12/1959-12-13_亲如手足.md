As Close as Brothers
Zeng Zhen

I seem to see Comrade Xu Xuehui already in Chita. There, Comrade Romanov meticulously and skillfully fitted her with a prosthetic hand. I seem to see two hands, crossing thousands of kilometers, clasped tightly together, two hearts beating rapidly, two faces glowing with happy smiles. This handshake, this smile, represents the incomparably deep affection between the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union.

Xu Xuehui's hand was an ordinary yet precious hand, one that had diligently worked for the Party and the people, and one that had bravely fought bandits to protect the property of the state and the people. In the fight, she lost this hand. Her noble qualities have moved hundreds of millions of Chinese people, and many international friends as well. Soviet Comrade Romanov wrote a letter to Comrade Xu Xuehui offering to install a prosthetic hand for her, so that she could continue to work for the Party and the people. Comrade Xu Xuehui wrote back. Both letters were written with such enthusiasm and warmth that they moved people deeply after reading them! "The Chinese and Soviet people are brothers!" This is vividly and profoundly expressed in these two letters.

The Soviet people have a pair of great hands. These hands have not only created countless miracles in production, construction, and scientific invention, but also selflessly extend to help others. The Chinese people deeply thank these great hands! As I read these two letters, my heart grew wings and flew far away: flying to factories, flying to mines, flying to exploration teams, flying to oil wells. I saw thousands of Soviet experts diligently helping us with their hands to build, to train talents, and to overcome difficulties.

Comrade Xu Xuehui lost a hand, and Soviet comrades gave her a hand; in our socialist construction, the Soviet government and people are constantly extending a helping hand. This "hand" is a "hand" as close as brothers. The Chinese people thank this hand, holding it tightly, just as Xu Xuehui tightly holds Romanov's hand. It is truly:

        The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is deeper than the sea, as close as brothers, never to be apart,
        Two letters express affection, eight hundred million people are of one mind!

    亲如手足
    曾真
    我仿佛看见徐学惠同志已经到了赤塔。在那儿，洛玛诺夫同志细心地巧妙地给她配上了一副假手。我仿佛看见两双手越过几千公里的距离，紧紧地握在一起，两颗心急剧地跳动，两张脸泛着幸福的微笑。这握手，这微笑，代表着的是中苏两国八亿人民无比深厚的感情：
    徐学惠的手，是一双平凡而又宝贵的手，它曾经辛勤地为党为人民工作，也曾经为了保护国家人民的财产和匪徒英勇地搏斗。在搏斗中她失去了这双手。她的崇高的品质，感动了亿万中国人民，也感动了许多国际朋友。苏联洛玛诺夫同志写信给徐学惠同志愿意为她安装一双假手，好使她继续为党为人民工作，徐学惠同志写了回信，两封信都写得那么热情，那么亲切，读后使人感动不已！“中苏人民是兄弟”！在这两封信中，生动而又深刻地表达出来了。
    苏联人民有着一双伟大的手，这双手不仅在生产建设和科学发明方面创造了无数奇迹，这双手还伸出来无私地援助别人。中国人民深深地感谢这双伟大的手！当我读着这两封信的时候，我的心像长了翅膀一样飞向远方：飞向工厂，飞向矿山，飞到勘探队里，飞到炼油井边，我看见千百个苏联专家正在用他们的双手辛勤地帮助我们建设，帮助我们培养人材，帮助我们克服困难。
    徐学惠同志失去了手，苏联同志给她一双手；在我们社会主义建设中，苏联政府和人民不断地伸出支援之手。这“手”是亲如手足的“手”，中国人民感谢这双手，紧紧地握着这双手，就像徐学惠紧紧地握着洛玛诺夫的手一样。正是：
        中苏情谊比海深，亲如手足不离分，
        两封书信表情意，八亿人民一条心！
