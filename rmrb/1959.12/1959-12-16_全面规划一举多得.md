Comprehensive Planning Achieves Multiple Goals

    The comprehensive planning carried out by Zao Yang County in Hubei Province, focusing on transportation construction, integrates transportation development with agricultural production. This not only facilitates current short-distance transportation and supports agricultural production but also prepares favorable conditions for future agricultural mechanization and other rural construction work. It is a good experience that achieves multiple goals.
    Transportation construction serves production, and rural transportation construction directly serves agricultural production. However, to carry out transportation construction, to build roads, a certain amount of labor must be occupied, and even a certain amount of cultivated land must be used. Therefore, in some people's eyes, rural transportation construction seems to conflict with agricultural production. They have various concerns about developing rural transportation construction and improving short-distance transportation conditions, fearing that it will occupy labor, fearing that it will occupy cultivated land, fearing that it will affect agricultural production increase, and so on. In short, there are many concerns and slow progress. Moreover, when this understanding has not been corrected and action is reluctantly taken, it is indeed easy to have the phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of another. For example, drawing people away to build roads during the busy farming season delays agricultural work, and these people are even more certain of their views.
    Of course, the facts are not like this. Road construction requires some labor, but a well-built road can save more labor. Road construction requires some land, but if planned well, it is also possible to not occupy much land, and even save a lot of land. The transportation construction in Zaoyang County has already proven this. Why is it that something that seems so contradictory to some people is not contradictory in Zaoyang County? The most important experience here is that the transportation construction in Zaoyang County has comprehensive planning.
    Comprehensive planning is the dialectical materialist working method that Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us. This working method requires us to see the connections between things, and not isolate things; it requires us to see the development of things, and not see them as static; it requires us to look ahead and behind, and make overall arrangements, and not be one-sided and isolated, seeing the trees but not the forest. The transportation construction work in Zaoyang County applied this working method, formulated a comprehensive plan, developed the favorable aspects of mutual promotion between transportation construction and agricultural production, avoided the unfavorable aspects of mutual restriction, and achieved multiple gains. For example, when they carried out deep plowing of the land, they reserved roadbeds for transportation lines; when they carried out comprehensive land consolidation and field formation, they combined it with comprehensive construction. In this way, under the premise of centering on agricultural production, the transportation construction work was also done well at the same time; and doing a good job in transportation construction saved labor, expanded the planting area, and promoted agricultural production.
    In order to prepare better transportation conditions for short-distance transportation next spring, now is the time to seize the opportunity to grasp rural transportation construction. It seems that the experience of comprehensive planning in Zaoyang County is well worth learning.

### 全面规划一举多得

    全面规划一举多得
    湖北省枣阳县全面规划，大搞交通建设，使交通建设和农业生产结合起来，既便利了当前的短途运输，支持了农业生产；又为以后的农业机械化、和农村的其它建设工作准备了有利条件，是一个一举多得的好经验。
    交通建设是为生产服务的，农村的交通建设更是直接为农业生产服务的。但是要搞交通建设，要修路，总得占用一定数量的劳动力，甚至还要占用一定数量的耕地。于是，在有些人看来，农村的交通建设似乎是同农业生产矛盾的。他们对于发展农村交通建设，改善短途运输条件，有种种顾虑，怕占用劳动力，怕占用耕地，怕影响农业增产，等等。总之是顾虑颇多，步履迟迟。而且，当这种认识没有端正就勉强行动起来以后，也确实容易发生顾此失彼的现象。例如，正在农忙的时候抽人去修路，误了农时，于是，这些人就更肯定了自己的看法。
    事实当然不是这样的。修路要占用一些劳动力，但是路修好了却能节约出更多的劳动力来。修路要占用一些土地，但是如果规划得好，也可以做到不多占土地，甚至可以节省出很多土地。枣阳县的交通建设已经证明了这一点。为什么在有些人看来是这样矛盾的事情，在枣阳县却并不矛盾呢？这里最重要的经验是枣阳县的交通建设是有全面规划的。
    全面规划，这是毛泽东同志经常教导我们的辩证唯物主义的工作方法。这种工作方法要求我们要看到事物间的联系，而不要把事物孤立起来；要求我们看到事物的发展，而不把它看成是静止的；要求我们瞻前顾后，统筹安排，而不要片面孤立，见树不见林。枣阳县的交通建设工作运用了这种工作方法，制定了全面规划，就发展了交通建设和农业生产之间互相促进的有利方面，避免了互相制约的不利方面，取得了一举多得的收获。比如他们在进行深翻土地时，就为交通干线留下了路基；在大搞连片土地园田化时，就结合进行全面施工。这样，就在以农业生产为中心的前提下，同时作好了交通建设的工作；交通建设工作搞好了，又节约了劳动力，扩大了播种面积，促进了农业生产。
    为了替明春的短途运输准备更好的运输条件，现在正是抓紧农村交通建设的时候。看来，枣阳县全面规划的经验，很值得学习。
