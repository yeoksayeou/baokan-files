Yuzhong Carries out the "Five Becomes" Movement to Promote Production

    (Reported by this newspaper) In this year's continuing Great Leap Forward, Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, fully utilized and developed the experience of the mass competition and appraisal campaign carried out during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. It successfully launched the "Five Becomes" movement: competition becomes a network, experience becomes standardized, red flags become a forest, models become a line, and mutual aid becomes a trend. This has powerfully promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production throughout the county. This year, the average grain yield per mu in the county increased by 31% compared to 1958, and the total industrial output value exceeded this year's plan by 21.5% sixty days ahead of schedule. Transportation and commerce also entered 1960 sixty days early.

    The trend of backward areas catching up with advanced areas, advanced areas becoming even more advanced, all trades striving to move upstream, and everyone striving to become a red flag bearer has become the social norm in Yuzhong County. Competition movements have been launched on all fronts and in every corner of the county, with various forms such as sports competitions, paired competitions, opponent competitions, challenges, red flag grabbing, issuing war letters, and appraisal platforms. This year, Gaoya People's Commune alone launched 96 red flag grabbing competitions, 32 long-term competitions focusing on production and work, and 210 member appraisal platforms. A total of 310 units above the production team level participated in paired competitions, and more than 15,000 members participated in opponent competitions, accounting for more than 70% of all members, forming a mass upsurge in participation in competitions. In the mass competition movement throughout the county, more than 3,000 red flag bearers or red flag units emerged, and 571 models were established. Every industry, every people's commune, every production team, and every task has a red flag bearer, red flag unit, or model. At least three red flag bearers (or red flag units) and two models have been established in industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, culture and education, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, diversified economy, tool reform, and collective welfare undertakings. The highest number is 169 red flag bearers (or red flag units) and 36 models.

    In the vigorous competition movement, the communist spirit of mutual assistance and common leap forward has been universally promoted due to the strengthening of the Party's political and ideological work. Cadres and masses of the Gongjing People's Commune, in their vigorous collaboration, proposed the slogan "Three weaknesses (weak labor, weak livestock, weak farm tools) do not leave the team, three strengths (strong labor, strong livestock, strong farm tools) help others," treating the difficulties of others as their own and the victories of others as their own. There have been 143 relatively large-scale collaborations carried out throughout the county, with the participation of more than 27,000 laborers, more than 2,200 livestock, and 710 vehicles. Rich teams have supported poor teams with a total of 122 livestock, more than 66,000 catties of seeds, more than 3.7 million catties of rations, and 800 pigs and sheep, all based on the principle of equivalent exchange. From 1952 to 1958, on average, only a little more than eleven production teams per year changed from poor to rich. This year, due to the fact that poor teams are striving to move upstream and rich teams are helping poor teams on the basis of people's communes, 33 poor teams have caught up with rich teams in one year.

    In the nationwide competition movement, Yuzhong County has conscientiously summarized and promoted advanced experiences. From how the Party committee leads the overall leap forward to every specific link of agricultural production, from ensuring high-yield, high-quality, and low-cost production to livestock breeding and mating, and from consolidating and developing canteens to running well-integrated traditional Chinese medicine clinics, a relatively complete set of experiences has been accumulated in all aspects. These experiences have been repeatedly tested and have blossomed and borne fruit throughout the county.

    Putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out mass movements are the basic methods of Yuzhong County in carrying out the "Five Becomes" movement. The Yuzhong County Party Committee regards the "Five Becomes" movement as an important measure to promote the continuing leap forward. It conducts regular research, focuses on ideology, key points, and the center for specific organization and leadership. Before carrying out each task, the county party committee convenes committees, enlarged meetings, or activist meetings to discuss and research, solve ideological problems, propose action slogans, point out the time and measures for completing tasks, and adopt a combination of pre-emptive red flag grabbing and final judgment to organize the masses to carry out major competitions. At the same time, it also promotes the overall leap forward by organizing inspection teams, holding on-site meetings and broadcast appraisal meetings, and adopting the method of using points to lead the whole, deeply establishing models, and summarizing and promoting experiences. After the county party committee issued the decision to carry out the high-yield field movement and the red flag bearer movement at the beginning of this year, it proposed the method of "one task, one red flag" to organize all members to carry out competitions, and selected more than a dozen key points from all aspects as typical examples for the county party committee to create experiences and guide the overall situation. The commune and brigade party committees have also established their own key points in various industries. In early July, the county party committee convened a thousand-person activist conference to hold up red flags, establish models, summarize, and promote advanced experiences. After the meeting, more than 13,000 "three-good members" and more than 1,000 "five-good cadres" were evaluated and selected throughout the county, pushing the movement to a higher climax.

    The Yuzhong County Party Committee believes that the "Five Becomes" movement is a good method for promoting the overall leap forward and an effective measure for achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. It also specifically implements the Party's mass movement policy. Therefore, it is actively summarizing experience to make this set of working methods more complete and strive for the continued leap forward of various tasks next year.

    榆中开展“五成”运动促进生产
    本报讯　甘肃省榆中县在今年的继续跃进中，充分运用和发展了1958年大跃进中开展全民大竞赛大评比的经验，成功地开展了竞赛成网、经验成套、红旗成林、标兵成列、互助成风的“五成”运动，有力地促进了全县工农业生产的发展。今年全县粮食平均亩产量比1958年增加31％，工业总产值提前六十天超额21.5％完成今年计划。交通运输和商业也都提前六十天跨入1960年。
    后进赶先进、先进更先进、行行争上游、人人争当红旗手，已经成为榆中县的社会风尚。全县各个战线、各个角落都开展了竞赛运动，有运动赛、对口赛、对手赛、打擂台、夺红旗、下战书、评比台等多种形式。仅高崖人民公社今年就开展了夺红旗竞赛九十六次，以生产和工作为内容的长期赛有三十二项，社员评比台二百一十个，参加对口赛的生产组以上的单位共三百一十个，参加对手赛的社员达一万五千多名，占全体社员的70％以上，形成了广大群众参加竞赛的热潮。全县在群众性的竞赛运动中，出现了三千多个红旗手或红旗单位，还树立了五百七十一名标兵，各行各业、各个人民公社、各个生产队、每一件事，都有红旗手、红旗单位或标兵。工业、农业、商业、交通、文教、林业、水利、畜牧业和多种经营、工具改革、集体福利事业等方面，都至少各有三个红旗手（或红旗单位）、两名标兵，最高的有一百六十九个红旗手（或红旗单位）和三十六名标兵。
    在大搞竞赛运动中，由于加强了党的政治思想工作，因而互相帮助、共同跃进的共产主义精神，有了普遍发扬。贡井人民公社的干部和群众在大搞协作中，提出“三弱（弱劳力、弱牲畜、弱农具）不出队，三强（强劳力、强牲畜、强农具）帮别人”的口号，把别人的困难当作自己的困难，把别人的胜利当作自己的胜利。全县开展的规模较大的协作即达一百四十三次，参加的劳动力有二万七千多人，牲畜二千二百余头，车七百一十辆。富队以等价交换原则支援穷队的牲畜总计有一百二十二头、种子六万六千余斤、口粮三百七十多万斤、猪羊八百口。全县从1952年到1958年，平均每年由穷变富的生产队只有十一个多。今年由于在人民公社化基础上穷队争上游、富队帮穷队，一年间就有三十三个穷队赶上了富队。
    榆中县在全民性的竞赛运动中，认真地总结和推广了先进经验，从党委如何领导全面跃进到农业生产的各个具体环节，从保证生产高产优质、低成本到牲畜饲养配种，从巩固发展食堂到办好中医联合诊所等各个方面，都分别积累了一套比较完整的经验，这些经验都经过反复试验，并在全县范围内开花结果。
    政治挂帅，大搞群众运动是榆中县开展“五成”运动的基本方法。中共榆中县委把开展“五成”运动，作为推动继续跃进的重要措施，经常进行研究，抓思想、抓重点、抓中心进行具体组织领导。在进行每项工作以前，县委就召开委员会、扩大会或积极分子会，讨论研究，解决思想问题，提出行动口号，指出完成任务的时间和措施，采取预夺红旗和最后裁判相结合的方法，组织群众开展大竞赛。同时又通过组织检查团召开现场会和广播评比会，采取以点带面的方法，深入重点树立标兵，总结推广经验，以推动全面跃进。县委在今年初发出开展丰产田运动和红旗手运动的决定后，提出“一项工作，一面红旗”的方法，组织全体社员开展竞赛，并从各个方面选定十几个重点，作为县委创造经验指导全面的典型，公社和大队党委也都建立了自己的各行各业的重点。7月上旬，县委又召开举红旗立标兵总结推广先进经验的千人活动分子大会；会后又在全县评比出“三好社员”一万三千多名、“五好干部”一千多名，使运动向更高的高潮发展。
    中共榆中县委鉴于“五成”运动是推动全面跃进的良好方法，是实现多快好省的有效措施，并具体贯彻了党的大搞群众运动方针，因此正在积极地总结经验，使这一套工作方法更加完善，争取明年各项工作的继续跃进。
