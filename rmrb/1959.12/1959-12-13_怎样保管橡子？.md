Acorns contain abundant starch and are a good substitute for grain.

Acorns that are not fully mature have yellowish-white skin and high moisture content, but their germination ability is low. Mature acorns have black skin and are prone to sprouting. Therefore, when picking, acorns of different colors should be stored separately, and damaged, moldy, deteriorated, and worm-eaten acorns should be removed. When selecting, you can pour the acorns into a bucket or vat filled with water, stir with a wooden stick, and remove the shriveled or worm-eaten acorns that float on the surface. The remaining acorns can be dried in the sun for longer storage.

There are two storage methods for acorns. One is dry storage, which is further divided into three types: storage with shells, storage without shells (acorn kernels), and storage as flour. It is best to store them without shells to prevent sprouting and reduce insect infestation. To store as flour, dry acorn kernels are ground into rice-sized particles, bagged, and stored. Ventilation must be maintained during storage.

The second is wet storage, which can maintain the germination ability of the seeds. This method is divided into two types: pit storage and water immersion. For pit storage, dig a pit or trench in the open air. After digging, lay a layer of about 80% dry sand at the bottom of the trench, then a layer of acorns, and another layer of sand, layer by layer, and then cover it with dry sand level with the ground, and then pile it into a mound. Dig a drainage ditch around the pit, and cover the mound with rainproof mats or straw.

    怎样保管橡子？
    橡子，含有丰富的淀粉质，是很好的粮食代用品。
    没有十分成熟的橡子，皮色黄白，水分较大，但发芽能力较低；成熟的橡子，皮色发黑，容易生芽。因此，采摘时要把不同皮色的橡子分开存放，把破伤和发霉变质虫蛀的橡子剔除。挑选时，可以把橡子倒在盛水的桶或缸内，用木棒搅拌，把浮在水面的干瘪或虫蛀的橡子捞出除掉，留下的橡子晒干后，可以作较长时间储存。
    橡子的储存方法，一种是干藏法：具体分为带壳储存，脱壳（橡仁）储存和磨粉储存三种；最好是脱壳储存，可以免得发芽，减少生虫。磨粉贮藏是将干橡仁碾成米粒大小，装袋存放。储存期间必须注意通风。
    二是湿藏法：可以保持种子的发芽能力，这种方法分土坑贮藏和水浸法两种。土坑贮藏法是在露天挖一个坑或沟，挖好后在沟底铺一层有八成干的砂，接着铺一层橡子，一层砂，层层埋上，上面再培上干砂与地面齐平，然后堆成一个土丘。在土坑周围挖一条排水沟，可在土堆覆盖防雨的席子或草秸。
