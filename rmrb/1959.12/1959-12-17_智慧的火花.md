Sparks of Wisdom
By Our Correspondent in Tianjin

The broad masses of workers in Tianjin are advancing by leaps and bounds toward mechanization and semi-mechanization. Under the slogans of "Putting down the sledgehammer and carrying pole," "Eliminating heavy labor," and "Changing manual operations," the workers, with soaring ambition and diligent hands, are staunchly overcoming all difficulties. In every industry, factory, and type of work, sparks of wisdom are flashing everywhere, and the workers' passionate songs of praise for semi-mechanization and mechanization are heard everywhere.

"Farewell, Sledgehammer!"

"Farewell, Sledgehammer!" This is a phrase frequently spoken recently by the forge workers of the Tianjin Fifth Tool Factory, who have already entered 1960 one month and seven days ahead of schedule.

Old forge worker Li Wenquan, who had been working with a sledgehammer for over thirty years, was moved to tears the first time he stood by the electric hammer and pressed the button. He said to those around him: In the old society, I toiled all day with a sledgehammer weighing more than ten pounds, and I couldn't even fill my stomach after work. Now, I, who have been working with a sledgehammer for half my life, am using a machine in my old age! With mechanization, I want to compete with the young people! As a result, the young forge worker Liu Changying, known as "Hercules," became the object of jokes. His colleagues said to him, "This time, you, the iron-armed man who swings a thirty-two-pound sledgehammer, will have nowhere to display your heroism!" Liu Changying said frankly, "Hey, look at what you're saying, I don't feel bad about throwing away the sledgehammer at all. Let's see what happens with the electric hammer!"

Now, entering this factory, the scene of forge workers sweating like rain, swinging sledgehammers by the roaring furnace is gone, and the laborious shouts and the clang of iron hammers are no longer heard. Replacing them is a row of electric hammers roaring rhythmically. The forge workers put down the sledgehammer and wield the self-made electric hammer with awe-inspiring presence. As soon as the worker turns on the power and presses the handle, sparks fly from under the electric hammer, and in the blink of an eye, a forging weighing more than twenty pounds is shaped into various parts according to the worker's wishes. The efficiency of mechanization is three to ten times higher than manual labor.

Mechanizing forging is a long-cherished wish of the forge workers. This year, the factory's production plan has increased by more than double compared to last year. After realizing mechanization, production has jumped onto the galloping horse of the Great Leap Forward. The four large and small electric power hammers made by the workers themselves have replaced 60% of the forge labor at once. November saw a continuous creation of new daily production records; by November 24, the annual production plan was completed ahead of schedule.

New Machines Replace Old Spinning Wheels

"The spinning wheel is as fast as the wind." Huang Daopo-style spinning wheels, one next to the other, were placed next to modern machines. The female workers shook the spinning wheel, and one person had to shake it five or six million times a day, shaking until their backs ached and their arms were sore. The spun yarn shafts sometimes could not even meet the needs of the sock knitting machines. Now all this is gone. A six-foot-long machine, similar in shape to a spinning machine, only needs to be pressed with a button to replace all the above.

In the past, knitting workers Cao Fucheng, Chen Huitai, maintenance worker Zhao Jinqing, Li Yuesen, and Zhao Zhongchang always wanted to create a machine to replace the spinning wheel. They had visited many factories in Tianjin, but no factory knew how to manufacture this kind of machine; this time, the factory launched a mechanization movement, and the five people gathered together, but could not figure out what it should look like. They thought about it day and night, paying attention everywhere. One day, they were walking on the street when they suddenly saw a yarn-crossing machine spining in a weaving factory from the window on the side of the road. After watching it for a long time, they were enlightened, and they started to work, imitating the structure of the machine.

The sock knitting factory could not find much scrap steel, so the factory leaders found a carpenter to help them build a wooden machine frame. The five workers also picked up some small iron rods and wrought iron plates from the east and west, and made many parts by drilling and filing. To make this machine, two small gear wheels were needed, but after searching the entire factory, there was not even a piece of iron plate that could be used to make gear wheels. What should they do? Cao Fucheng and Zhao Jinqing got up in the dark and searched all the scrap iron stalls on the "early market." There were only six or seven old "iron cakes." The two discussed it for a while and bought them all back. That day, they used files to file and manual milling to mill, and the gear wheels were made. Later, they took turns using files to file for seven days, modifying it more than a hundred times, and used perseverance to make a peach wheel. Sometimes, when they felt insufficient confidence, they used the words of the Party branch secretary to encourage each other: "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." In order to overcome difficulties, they held Zhuge Liang meetings or consulted with the workers. In this way, more than four hundred parts were pulled out one by one. The yarn shafts produced by the new machine were neat and compact. When the female workers who had been shaking the spinning wheel for many years stood up from the ground, they enthusiastically wrote poems to praise:

Mechanization is a magic weapon, production is high and quality is good,
No need to stare, no need to shake, turn on the switch and it runs,
Hands don't hurt, back doesn't ache, the Party's kindness is higher than the sky.

The Birth of the Conveyor Belt

In the workshop of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, you can see rows of rotating conveyor belts constantly conveying raw rubber, sponges, rubber soles, finished shoes, and pressed toe caps. All the handling work in the workshop is replaced by conveyor belts according to the production sequence. Seeing this scene, who would have thought that this was made by the workers of this factory without asking the state for materials, using their own efforts!

The handling work in the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory workshop was all done manually. The labor intensity of the handling workers was high, and the workshop also appeared narrow and crowded. In order to improve this situation, young rubber milling workers Li Xuezheng, Chen Zhiqing, and Zhao Junhua formed a conveyor belt research group, intending to make a belt for direct conveying. In the trial production process, they received the support of the Party committee, and their confidence was even higher, and they decided to use all waste materials to solve the material problem. They didn't know how to design and calculate, so they used rulers to measure; if they didn't have a motor, they connected the main shaft to the ground shaft of the rubber milling machine through a belt; if they didn't have round iron to make the conveyor belt idler shaft, they replaced it with bamboo tubes. Lacking the support roller shaft for the conveyor belt, Chen Zhiqing thought for a long time and decided to use bamboo tubes instead of iron tubes. After more than twenty days, more than thirty group professional meetings were held, and finally the entire trial production of the conveyor belt was completed. They also used a day off to install the conveyor belt. After not running for two days, the bamboo tube was crushed due to the large weight of the conveyor belt, and there was another twist, so they had to stop. They also found round hardwood for making wooden handles from the wood shop, drilled holes and installed it, and it ran very normally after operation. From the first conveyor belt of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, in less than two months, only spent more than five hundred yuan, there were ten simple conveyor belts put into production, saving a total of more than fifty handling workers, four wheelbarrows, saving freight of seventeen thousand yuan throughout the year. The average efficiency of the whole factory was increased by one and a half times.

Continuous Innovation Bit by Bit

The needle welding group of Tianjin Knitting Factory has five female workers. In the past, no one had paid attention to them. But recently, they have become a well-known mechanization group in the whole factory.

One day, Zhao Guoliang, the secretary of the Party branch of the workshop, said to Tian Benhui of the needle welding group: "Little Tian, the weaving workers are all striving for high yield and high quality, but your needles can't keep up. In the future, we have to rely on you!" Tian Benhui immediately replied: "You just wait and see!"

"If we want to have enough needle supply, we have to use machines to replace manual operation! But, what kind of machine should we use?" Tian Benhui was really worried. At night, she lay in bed thinking: To weld a needle, you have to dip a small stick in hydrochloric acid. One person has to weld more than six hundred needles a day, so you have to dip it more than six hundred times! It would be much easier if we could make an automatic hydrochloric acid dipping gadget! But what method should be used to automatically dip hydrochloric acid? At this time, she suddenly thought of an eye drop bottle. When you pinch it with your hand, a drop of liquid flows down. …

The next morning at six o'clock, Tian Benhui entered the factory. She asked the medical office for a large glass tube. She asked the laboratory for a rubber tube. After one experiment, it worked, but the hydrochloric acid drops were too big. She thought of a syringe and immediately borrowed one from the medical office for testing. Automatic hydrochloric acid dipping was finally successful, and the daily output of welded needles increased from six hundred to one thousand three hundred.

At this time, someone said again: "Hydrochloric acid dipping is automated, but it is too troublesome to take the needles one by one when welding them!" Wang Yitong took over and said: "Isn't the clip in the rifle hold several bullets?" Before she could finish speaking, everyone rushed to say: "Yes, let's make a needle clip and put one or two hundred needles in it, so that it drops one by one!"

Three days later, the needle clip was made, and each person's daily output increased to one thousand eight hundred. As the needle welding speed increased, new inconveniences were discovered. That is, after welding, you have to use your hands to push the needles out, which is too slow. So everyone came up with an automatic needle pushing board, and the daily output increased to two thousand one hundred.

But not long after, everyone felt that the needles pushed by the needle pushing board were bouncing all over the ground. Song Shouhuan said: "Let's use a horizontal water basin on top, and the needles will fall into the basin." The horizontal water basin was installed, and the personal daily output jumped to two thousand three hundred and fifty.

With such a high output, after washing with water, you still have to wipe them dry one by one, which is still a waste of time. Liu Jinlan suddenly thought: "Just don't wipe it, just use the sun to dry it!" The five female workers discussed it and immediately tested it, and it really worked. But there is one thing, you can't always rely on the weather. What should you do when it's cloudy and rainy? Everyone studied it, and the factory had waste steam that could be used for baking, so they made an operating box for automatic drying, and each person's daily output was increased to two thousand six hundred, saving three people to support the weaving workshop. In this way, the five female workers, with the spirit of continuous revolution, from nothing to something, from small to large, bit by bit, made the completely manual operation group completely mechanized.

    智慧的火花
    本报驻天津记者
    天津市广大职工正在向机械化、半机械化飞驰猛进。工人们在放下大锤和扁担，消灭笨重劳动，改变手工操作等口号下，用凌云壮志，用勤劳的双手，顽强地战胜一切困难。各行业、工厂、工种，到处闪烁着智慧的火花，到处传来工人们对半机械化机械化热情的颂歌。
    “别了，大锤！”
    “别了，大锤！”这是已经提前一个月零七天跨进1960年的天津第五工具厂锻工们最近常说的一句话。
    和大锤打了三十多年交道的老锻工李文泉，第一次走到电锤旁，捺动电钮时，激动得热泪盈眶。他对旁人说：在旧社会，成天抱着十几磅重的大锤苦干，下了班精疲力竭，还混不饱肚子。现在，我这个和大锤打了半辈子交道的人，老了却用上机器了！有了机械化，我还要和青年们赛一赛呢！这一来，号称“大力士”的青年锻工刘长英却成了人们开玩笑的对象。伙伴们对他说：“这回你这个抡三十二磅大锤的铁膀子汉，又该英雄无用武之地啦！”刘长英却坦然地说：“嘿，瞧你们说的，扔了大锤我一点也不心疼。咱们电锤上见吧！”
    现在走进这个工厂，汗如雨淋的锻工们，在熊熊的炉火旁挥舞大锤的情景不见了，吃力的吆喝声和铁锤的叮当声听不到了。代替它们的是一排电锤在有节奏地轰鸣。锻工们放下大锤，威武地操纵着自制的电锤，只见工人把电门一开，把手一捺，电锤下火花飞溅，转眼之间一块二十多斤重的锻件，就随着人的心愿，打成各式各样的部件了。机械化的效率，比手工提高三到十倍。
    打铁机械化，这是锻工们多少年来的宿愿。这个工厂今年的生产计划比去年增加了一倍多，实现机械化后，生产跨上了跃进骏马。工人自制的大小四台电动夹板锤，一下子就代替了60％的锻工劳动，11月份连续创造日产新纪录；到11月24日就提前完成了全年的生产计划。
    新机器代替了老纺车“纺车儿快如风”。黄道婆式的纺车，一台紧挨着一台，放在近代化的机器旁边。女工们摇着纺车儿，一个人一天要摇五、六万次，摇得腰酸胳膊痛，打出的纱轴，有时还供不上织袜机的需要。现在这些都不见了，一台六尺长的机器，外形似纺纱机，只要一按电钮就代替了上述的一切。
    以前编织工人曹福成、陈辉泰，保全工赵金庆、李玉森、赵忠昌总想弄一种机器来代替纺车。天津的工厂跑得不少，可就是没有一家工厂会制造这种机器；这次，工厂里搞起了机械化运动，五个人凑在一起，怎么也琢磨不出个模样儿。他们日思夜想，处处注意。一天，他们走在街上，忽然从路旁一家织布厂的窗户里看到有台过纱机正在打穗。看了好大一会，他们的思想开窍了，就仿照着机器的结构，动起手来。
    织袜子的工厂，找不出多少废钢铁，工厂的领导就找来了一个木匠，帮助他们打了一个木头的机器架子。五个工人也东拣西找地弄来了一些小铁棍，熟铁板，就钻钻锉锉地做成了许多零件。要做这台机器，必须要有两个小牙轮，但是找遍全厂，连一块能做牙轮的铁板也没有，怎么办呢？曹福成、赵金庆两人就摸黑起床，找遍了“早市”上所有卖废铁的摊子，只有六、七块旧“铁饼”。两个人商量了一阵，都给买了回来。当天，就用锉刀锉，用人工铣，牙轮做成了。后来他们轮流着用锉刀锉了七天，修改一百多次，硬用毅力，又制作了一个桃轮。有时当他们感到信心不足的时候，他们就用党支部书记的话来相互勉励：“天下无难事，只怕有心人”。为了克服困难，他们召开了诸葛亮会，或找职工们共同商量。就这样，一件一件地把四百多个零件扣出来了。新机器打出的纱轴，又整齐又紧凑。当摇了多年纺车的女工们从地上站起来的时候，她们热情地写诗歌颂道：
    机械化是法宝，产量高质量好，
    不用瞅不用摇，电闸一开它就跑，
    手不痛腰不酸，党的恩情比天高。
          传送带的诞生
    在大中华橡胶厂的车间里，可以看到一条条转动着的传动带在不停地传送着生胶、海绵、胶底、成鞋、压包头等，车间的一切搬运工作，都按生产顺序由传送带代替了。看到这种景象，谁能想到这是这个厂的工人们没有向国家要材料，用自力更生的办法制造出来的呢！
    大中华橡胶厂车间搬运工作都是使用手工，搬运工人的劳动强度大，车间也显得狭窄和拥挤。为了改善这种状况，年轻的轧胶工人李学政、陈志清、赵钧华组成了传送带研究小组，打算做一条带子直接传送。在试制过程中得到了党委的支持，他们的信心更高了，并决定所有材料都用废旧料解决。他们不会设计和计算，就用尺子比划；没有马达就把主轴通过皮带连接在轧胶机的地轴上；没有圆铁做传送带托辊轴，就用竹筒代替。缺少传送带的托带辊轴，陈志清想了好久，决定用竹筒代替铁筒。经过二十多天的时间，召开了三十多次小组专业会议，终于完成了传送带的全部试制工作。他们又用一个休息日的时间，把传送带安装起来。没有运转两天，因为传送带重量大把竹筒压碎裂了，又发生了波折，只好停下来。他们又从木器行找来做木柄的圆硬木，打好眼安装上，经过运转十分正常。从大中华橡胶厂的第一条传送带起，不到两个月的时间，只花了五百多元就有十条简易传送带投入了生产，共节约了五十多个搬运工人，四辆小推车，全年节约运费一万七千元。全厂平均提高效率一倍半。
      一点一滴不断革新
    天津市针织厂焊针小组有五个女工，以前，谁也没有注意过她们。可是在最近，她们却成了全厂知名的机械化小组。
    一天，车间党支部书记赵国良向焊针组的田本惠说：“小田，织布工人都在闹高产优质，可是你们的针供不上。往后，可得瞧你们的啦！”田本惠立刻回答说：“您就瞧好吧！”
    “要想焊针供应充足，非叫机器代替手工操作不可！可是，用什么机器呢？”田本惠心里真着急。晚上，她躺在床上想：焊一根针，要用小棍蘸点镪水点
  上，一天一个人要焊六百多根针，就得点六百多下！要是搞个自动点镪水的玩艺儿，该多省事呀！可是到底用什么法子自动点镪水呢？这时，她忽然想起了眼药瓶，用手一捺，药水就往下流一滴。……
    第二天早晨六点钟，田本惠就进了工厂。向医务室要来个大玻璃管。找试验室要来个胶皮管，一试验，行是行，就是镪水点子太大。她又想起了注射器，马上找医务室借来作试验。自动点镪水终于搞成功了，焊针日产量由六百根提高到一千三百根。
    这时候，又有人说：“点镪水自动化啦，可是焊针的时候，还得一根一根的拿，太麻烦！”王义通接过来说：“步枪里头的梭子，不是一卡好几个子弹么？”没等她说完，大家抢着说：“对，咱们来个针梭子，一块放上一、二百根针，叫它一根一根地往外掉！”
    三天以后，针梭子作好了，每个人的日产量，又提高到一千八百根。焊针速度一快，又发现了新的不方便之处。就是焊好以后，还得用手把针往外扒，太慢了。于是大家又搞出来个自动推针板，日产量又提高到两千一百根。
    可是过不多久，大家都感到推针板推的针，蹦得满地都是。宋守环说：“咱们用卧式水盆卡在上头，针就掉在盆里了。”卧式水盆装上了，个人日产量又跃进到了两千三百五十根。
    产量这么高，用水洗以后，还得一根一根地擦干，这样还是浪费时间。刘金兰忽然想起：“干脆不擦它，就用太阳晒吧！”五个女工一商量，马上试验，结果还是真行。可有一样儿，总不能靠天吃饭，阴天下雨怎么办呢？大伙一研究，厂里有废汽可以用来烘烤，于是就作了个操作箱自动干燥，每个人的日产量又提到二千六百根，省下三个人支援了织布车间。就这样，五个女工以不断革命的精神，从无到有，从小到大，一点一滴，使完全手工操作的小组，全部机械化了。
