    110 kV Oil-Poor Circuit Breaker
    Automatically Cuts Off Faulty Transmission Lines
    Saving Steel and Transformer Oil Compared to Oil-Rich Circuit Breakers
    The Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a 110 kV oil-poor circuit breaker.

    This circuit breaker has a breaking capacity of 2,500 MVA and can automatically cut off faulty lines in less than one-tenth of a second. If the fault is quickly eliminated, it can also automatically reclose, which plays a role in protecting electrical equipment and ensuring safe power transmission in high-voltage lines.

    Circuit breakers are essential electrical appliances for high-voltage lines and power consumption departments, and are needed in large quantities. The newly trial-produced oil-poor circuit breaker can save about twenty tons of valuable materials such as steel and transformer oil compared to oil-rich circuit breakers of the same voltage level.

    110千伏少油断路器
    输电线路发生故障立即自动切断
    比多油断路器省钢材和变压器油
    上海华通开关厂最近成功地试制出一种一百一十千伏少油断路器。
    这种断路器的断流容量达二千五百兆伏安，可以在不到十分之一秒的刹那间，把发生故障的线路自动切断，如故障很快消除，还可自动合闸，这就在高压线路中起到保护电器设备和保证安全输电的作用。
    断路器为高压线路和用电部门所不可少的重要电器，需要数量很大。新试制的这种少油断路器，比同电压等级的多油断路器可以节约钢材、变压器油等贵重材料二十吨左右。
