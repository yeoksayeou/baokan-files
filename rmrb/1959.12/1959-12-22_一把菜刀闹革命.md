　　"Revolting with a Kitchen Knife"

　　The story of the Zhichengxing Iron and Steel Products Factory workers starting a great technical revolution with simple tools like a manual vise makes one unable to help but recall the moving story of our Workers' and Peasants' Red Army "revolting with a kitchen knife" back in the day; it also makes one unable to help but think: we not only started the revolution from scratch, but also started construction from scratch, didn't we? Yes, there are many difficulties in using a vise to make a great technical revolution and using a kitchen knife to make a revolution, but we Communists have always had broad vision and great spirit. We have always valued objective conditions, but we are never proponents of conditionalism. Since history is created by the people, when the conditions for revolution are already in place, why can't a kitchen knife make a revolution? Great ambition is originally a characteristic of proletarian revolutionary fighters. As soon as our proletariat stepped onto the historical stage, it shouldered the historical mission of liberating all mankind and made great ambitions to transform the entire world. When the weapons in our hands were only kitchen knives, red-tasseled spears, and a small number of backward guns, we were fully confident that the Chinese revolution would surely be victorious, the reactionaries would surely be overthrown, and the motherland would surely become prosperous and strong; as expected, imperialism was driven away by us, China's bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism were eradicated at the root, and a new socialist China was born. Now, in order to rapidly change our country's backward situation of "poverty and blankness," we are again making revolution from scratch, and we must build a brand-new socialist power on the broken-down mess left to us by the old society. Under the leadership of the Party, the 650 million people of the whole country have unleashed soaring enthusiasm and are developing at a speed of one day equals twenty years, advancing like a rocket! The Zhichengxing Iron and Steel Products Factory's story of "revolting with a vise" is not a wonderful microcosm of this great process? It is precisely because they have carried forward the proletarian revolutionary tradition and noble qualities, have broad vision, are fearless, full of enthusiasm, and courageous to move forward, that they can create remarkable achievements in production, revolutionize the backward and heavy manual labor, and win such a great victory in the struggle to develop productivity and in the struggle against nature!

　　Why can a small factory like Zhichengxing, which lacks both tools and equipment and technical strength, have such great ambitions, noble style, and heroic spirit? This is because they have unlimited enthusiasm for the proletarian revolutionary cause and a high sense of responsibility for the socialist construction cause. When they "encounter thousands of pounds of large steel plates, it is extremely difficult to complete the plan," how anxious they are! When they saw the oxygen cutting the edges of the steel plate, they felt as uncomfortable as if their own hearts were being cut. With such a high sense of responsibility for the socialist cause, how could they not strive for progress and work hard? We often say that the Party's general line concentrates and reflects the urgent desire of the 650 million people of our country to quickly "get rid of poverty and blankness," and this urgent desire is also extremely strong for the workers of this small factory. "Poverty and blankness," for those who are with levers all day long, for those who deal with steel plates bare-handed all day long, for those who lost an eye and had a finger cut off due to industrial accidents before liberation, their experience is so concrete and so profound! The high degree of love for socialism, the urgent desire to rapidly change the backward face, the infinite loyalty and high degree of consciousness to the Party's general line, this is the source of the Zhichengxing factory workers' strength, and it is also the ideological basis for their great ambitions. This fact eloquently shows that once the Party's general line is grasped by the masses and becomes the conscious demand of the broad masses, what a great power it will generate!

　　The Party's general line for building socialism concentrates and expresses the great ambitions of the 650 million people of our country. Today, whether we can have great ambitions and whether we dare to think and act, first of all, depends on whether our thoughts and actions conform to the Party's general line for socialist construction, and whether our mental state can adapt to the entire era and to the high-speed development of productive forces. Some units have very good conditions, but they do not pay enough attention to guiding the masses to make a great technical revolution and rapidly develop productive forces, and they feel that this is not good and that is not good. Whenever they encounter difficulties, they sigh and moan, and shrink back. They do not work hard on many things that can be done. This kind of lazy and unambitious right-leaning conservative thought is far from the requirements of the general line and the high-spirited mental state of the Zhichengxing Iron and Steel Products Factory workers by more than a hundred thousand miles. It should be seen that our cause of building socialism today is completely different from the situation of "revolting with a kitchen knife" in the struggle to seize power in the past. Although there is still a long way to go in terms of our economic foundation and the great ideals of socialism and communism that we want to achieve. However, after ten years of recovery and construction, we have laid the foundation for socialist industrialization. Obviously, as long as the leading cadres of our factories and enterprises have the great ambition of "revolting with a kitchen knife" like the workers of the Zhichengxing Iron and Steel Products Factory, completely eliminate the world outlook of idlers and cowards existing in some cadres, hold high the red flag of the general line, and fully carry forward the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act of the broad masses, not be afraid of all difficulties, set great ambitions, do great things, we will certainly be able to create a more vigorous and great cause, we will certainly be able to rapidly promote the development of social productive forces, build socialism at high speed, and we will certainly be able to conquer nature, establish a strong country, and realize the great ideals of our revolutionary predecessors and hundreds of millions of people!

### “一把菜刀闹革命”

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

　　“一把菜刀闹革命”
    志成兴钢铁制品厂职工从一台手工老虎钳等简单工具开始大闹技术革命的事迹，使人情不自禁地联想起我们工农红军当年“一把菜刀闹革命”的动人故事；也情不自禁地联想到：我们不仅闹革命是白手起家，搞建设又何尝不是白手起家？是的，用一把老虎钳大闹技术革命和用一把菜刀闹革命，都是有很多困难的，但我们共产党人从来就是具有远大的目光和雄伟的气魄。我们从来重视客观条件，但永远不是唯条件论者。既然历史是人民群众创造的，当革命的条件已经具备的时候，为什么一把菜刀不能闹革命呢？雄心大志，这本来就是无产阶级革命战士的特色。我们无产阶级一登上历史舞台，就肩负了解放全人类的历史使命，就立下了雄心大志，要改造整个世界。当我们手中的武器还只是些菜刀、红缨枪和为数极少的落后枪枝的时候，我们就完全相信，中国的革命一定能取得胜利，反动派一定能打倒，祖国一定会繁荣富强；果然，帝国主义被我们赶跑了，中国的官僚资本主义和封建主义被我们连根拔除了，社会主义的新中国诞生了。现在，为了迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的落后状况，我们又在白手起家闹革命，要在旧社会留给我们的破烂摊子上，建立起一个崭新的社会主义强国。全国六亿五千万人民在党的领导下，发挥了冲天干劲，正在以一天等于二十年的速度，飞也似地向前发展！志成兴钢铁制品厂“一把老虎钳闹革命”的事迹，不正是这个伟大过程的一个绝妙缩影吗？正因为他们发扬了无产阶级的革命传统和高贵品质，目光远大，毫无畏惧，满腔热情，勇往直前，因而他们才能在生产中创造显著的成绩，才能革掉落后的笨重体力劳动的命，才能在发展生产力的斗争中，在向自然的斗争中打这么一个大胜仗！
    为什么志成兴这样既缺工具设备又缺技术力量的小厂，能有这样的雄心大志、高尚风格、豪迈气概呢？这是因为他们对无产阶级革命事业具有无限热情，对社会主义建设事业具有高度责任感。当他们“碰上千斤大钢板，完成计划难上难”的时候，他们是多么焦急呵！当他们看见氧气割卷了钢板的边沿，就感到像割痛了自己的心似地难受，他们对社会主义事业具有这样高度的责任感，还能不奋发有为，大干特干吗？我们常说：党的总路线集中地反映了我国六亿五千万人民要求迅速“摆脱一穷二白的迫切愿望”，而这种迫切愿望在这个小厂的职工来说，也是再强烈不过的了。“一穷二白”，这对于整日与杠棒为伍的人来说，这对于整天赤手空拳与钢板打交道的人来说，这对于解放前因工伤事故而瞎掉一只眼、切掉手指头的人来说，体会得是多么具体、多么深刻呵！对社会主义的高度热爱，迅速改变落后面貌的迫切愿望，对于党的总路线的无限忠诚和高度的自觉，这就是志成兴厂职工力量的源泉，也是他们立下雄心大志的思想基础。这一事实雄辩地说明：党的总路线一为群众所掌握，变为广大群众自觉的要求，就会产生多么巨大的威力！
    党的建设社会主义的总路线正是集中地表现了我国六亿五千万人民这样的雄心大志。今天，能不能立下雄心大志，能不能敢想敢做，首先要看我们的思想和行动是否符合党的社会主义建设总路线，我们的精神状态能否与整个时代、能否与高速度发展的生产力相适应。有些单位，他们的条件很好，可是他们对引导群众大闹技术革命尽速发展生产力却重视不够，感到这也不行，那也不行，一遇到困难，就唉声叹气，畏畏缩缩，许多可能办到的事情也不努力去办，这种懒懒散散、胸无大志的右倾保守思想，与总路线的要求和志成兴钢铁制品厂职工那种意气风发的精神状态比较起来，相距何止十万八千里。应该看到，我们今天建设社会主义的事业，和过去在夺取政权的斗争中那种“一把菜刀闹革命”的情况已经完全不同了。虽然就我国的经济基础和我们所要达到的社会主义、共产主义的远大理想来说，还相差很远。但是，经过十年来的恢复和建设，我们已经奠定了社会主义工业化的基础。显然，只要我们工厂企业的领导干部，都具有志成兴钢铁制品厂职工的这种“一把菜刀闹革命”的雄心大志，彻底破除存在在某些干部中的懒汉和懦夫的世界观，把总路线的红旗高高举起，充分发扬广大群众敢想敢说敢作敢为的共产主义风格，不怕一切困难，立大志，干大事，我们就一定能够更加干出一番轰轰烈烈的事业来，我们就一定能迅速推动社会生产力向前发展，高速度地建设社会主义，我们也就一定能够征服自然，建立强国，实现我们的革命前辈和亿万人民的伟大理想！
