    Model Stockman Aas Mais
    Works diligently, technically advanced, helps the backward without regard to remuneration
    Milk production sharply increased and will reach the seven-year plan target
    In the mass movement to strive for high yields of livestock products in response to the call of the Party, many advanced figures on the agricultural production front of the German Democratic Republic and their model examples have been valued and praised.
    Jano Aas Mais, a dairy farmer at the "Grand Nangenwich" state farm in Pritzwalk County, Potsdam District, is one of these advanced figures.
    As early as 1955, the cows raised by Aas Mais had an average annual milk yield of 5,800 kilograms, almost double the national average. But he was not satisfied with his achievements. He often wondered: Why can't all the dairy cows in Pritzwalk County produce so much milk? Some colleagues said to him, "State farms have good feed, of course they produce more milk. You go to an agricultural production cooperative and try it, and your skills will be exhausted."
    Aas Mais was not shaken and was determined to increase milk production throughout the county. He asked himself: "Yes, why not go to a cooperative?" At this time, a nearby cooperative offered him a high salary of 1,000 marks per month to hire him, but he did not go. He decided to go to a backward agricultural cooperative to help improve breeding work, where the monthly salary was 500 marks.
    Last December, Master Aas Mais came to the agricultural cooperative in the village of Triglitz. At that time, the breeding management work of this cooperative was really unsatisfactory. Eighty dairy cows only produced 177 kilograms of milk per day, 46 of them had not calved, the cowshed was very dirty, and there was no fixed time for milking and feeding. As soon as Aas Mais arrived, he immediately cleaned the cowshed, grouped the cows according to milk yield, fed them regularly and according to type, and fixed the milking time. Due to the change in feeding methods, in a very short time, the daily milk production of the eighty cows increased to 628 kilograms. This year, the average annual milk yield per cow will reach 3,600 kilograms, which has reached the target set by the seven-year plan.
    Not long ago, at the dairy cow competition held in this county, four of the cows raised by Master Aas Mais won first prize.
    Master Aas Mais not only feeds the cows he is responsible for well, but he also regularly passes on his experience to other breeders every week. He is responsible for the guidance work of the breeding teams of three cooperatives in the county. In this way, he is respected and loved by many farmers in the county.
    The "New Germany Daily" recently published an editorial entitled "The Model Example of Master Aas Mais," pointing out that these advanced figures and advanced behaviors are of great significance for completing the current main economic tasks of the German Democratic Republic. The "New Germany Daily" said that at present, the German Democratic Republic has a total of 2.1 million dairy cows, with an average annual milk yield of 2,674 kilograms per cow. If the milk yield of each dairy cow reaches the level of the cows raised by Master Aas Mais, the country can increase 2 million tons of milk every year. (Xin)

    模范饲养员亚斯迈斯
    工作认真技术先进帮助落后不计报酬
    牛奶产量急剧提高将达七年计划指标
    在响应党的号召而开展的争取畜产品高产的群众运动中，德意志民主共和国农业生产战线上许多先进人物和他们的模范事例受到人们重视和赞扬。
    波茨坦专区普利兹瓦克县“大南根维希”国营农场的一位奶牛饲养员亚诺·亚斯迈斯，就是这些先进人物中的一个。
    早在1955年，亚斯迈斯养的牛每年平均产奶量就达到五千八百公斤，超过全国平均产量几乎一倍。但他并没有满足于自己的成绩，他经常想：为什么整个普利兹瓦克县的奶牛不能都产这么多的奶呢？有的同事对他说，“国营农场有好的饲料，当然产奶多，你到一个农业生产合作社去试试，你的本领就到头了。”
    亚斯迈斯没有动摇，一心想提高全县牛奶产量，他问自己：“是呵，为什么不到一个合作社去呢？”这时附近的一个合作社用每月一千马克的高工资聘请他去，他没有去。他决定到一个落后的农业合作社去帮助改进饲养工作，那里每月工资是五百马克。
    去年12月，亚斯迈斯老师傅来到了特里格立兹村的农业合作社。当时，这个合作社的饲养管理工作真是不能令人满意。八十头奶牛，每天只出一百七十七公斤的奶，其中四十六头没有下过牛犊，牛厩里非常不干净，挤奶和上料都没有固定时间。亚斯迈斯一到，马上动手把牛厩打扫干净，按产奶量把牛分了组，定时和分类喂料，挤奶的时间也固定下来，由于改变饲养方法，在很短时间内，八十头牛每天的产奶量就提高到六百二十八公斤。今年每头牛的平均年产奶量将达到三千六百公斤，已经达到七年计划规定的指标。
    不久前，在这个县里举行的奶牛比赛会上，亚斯迈斯老师傅养的牛有四头得了头等奖。
    亚斯迈斯老师傅不但把自己负责养的牛喂得好，他每星期还定期向其他饲养员们传授经验。他担负了县里三个合作社饲养队的辅导工作。这样，他受到县里许多农民的尊重和爱戴。
      “新德意志报”最近以亚斯迈斯老师傅的模范事例为题发表了社论，指出这些先进人物和先进行为对于完成德意志民主共和国目前主要经济任务具有巨大意义。“新德意志报”说，目前德意志民主共和国共有奶牛二百一十万头，每头每年平均产奶量二千六百七十四公斤。如果每头奶牛产奶量都达到亚斯迈斯老师傅养的牛的产奶水平，全国每年就可以增加二百万吨牛奶。（辛）
