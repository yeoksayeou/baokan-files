Participating in Public Welfare Labor Has Endless Benefits
120,000 University Students in the Capital Continuously Improve Their Awareness Through Practical Training

(Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that the universities and colleges in the capital are systematically organizing teachers and students to participate in social welfare labor and taking this as an important measure to implement the Party's educational policy and cultivate knowledgeable and skilled (red and expert) intellectuals. Through public welfare labor, the connection between students and the country's socialist construction has been strengthened, and the relationship between intellectuals and the workers and peasants has been deepened.

There are currently 120,000 university students in the capital. Since last spring, they have participated in the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production, the wheat harvest in the People's Communes, the autumn harvest, deep plowing of land, and afforestation. After the start of the summer semester this year, they participated in the construction of the Miyun Reservoir, the National Day projects in the capital, and the emergency harvesting of Chinese cabbage, peanuts, and sweet potatoes in the suburban communes. During this period, they completed a total of two million workdays, which is equivalent to twice the total number of workdays used to construct the Guanting Reservoir. Among them, they excavated 1.5 million cubic meters of earth and stone, planted 40,000 mu of trees, cultivated 53,000 mu of land, and produced 1,700 tons of indigenous steel and more than 1,900 tons of local steel.

In public welfare labor, the students closely connected themselves with the country's current political struggles and received relatively profound socialist education. Recently, students participating in labor at the Miyun Reservoir saw that this project was originally scheduled to be built in the Third Five-Year Plan. Now, under the guidance of the General Line, exploration, design, preparation, and construction are being carried out simultaneously. Construction started on September 1st last year, and flood control was achieved in August this year. They deeply realized the unparalleled vitality of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Some teachers and students who originally had incorrect attitudes towards the General Line and the Great Leap Forward quickly realized that their position and thinking were inconsistent with the working people after seeing this situation and expressed their desire to humbly learn from the working people.

Under the influence of the working people, the majority of teachers and students also demonstrated a spirit of tenacious struggle and fearlessness of difficulties. When students from the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications cleared the silt from the head of the flood control dam at the Miyun Reservoir construction site, they were not afraid of dirt or stench and jumped into the deep mud to persevere in the battle. Many students from the University of Science and Technology of China, regardless of the high mountains and dangerous roads, fought against the five or six-level winds in sub-zero weather and finally built a horizontal road halfway up the eastern mountain of the Miyun Reservoir dam, successfully completing the task ahead of schedule. During the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production last year, more than 2,000 students from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel went to 21 provinces and cities to help build more than 25,000 various steelmaking furnaces and ironmaking furnaces, solved more than 800 technical problems related to improving steel quality, and made more than 3,000 inventions, creations, and technical innovations. At present, on the basis of these "small indigenous groups," "small modern groups" have been gradually built, which have further played a role in steelmaking. Many students also learned the lofty spirit of self-sacrifice of the working people. In the steelmaking movement, Yang Hongshi, a student from Tsinghua University, braved thick smoke and gas to jump into the blast furnace to repair it, preventing an accident in which the blast furnace was burned out.

Through public welfare labor, the students established a relationship of sharing weal and woe with the workers and peasants. When students from the Department of Philosophy of Peking University left the Huangcun People's Commune in Beijing, the farmers sent them off for ten miles, weeping to say goodbye. In June of this year, the Huangcun People's Commune had fields of high-yielding wheat, and the good news was posted to Peking University, dozens of miles away, the next day. The students were overjoyed and spread the news. In July, the commune suffered from waterlogging, and the students were restless and demanded to return to the commune to fight the disaster. Some students from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel said when talking about their labor gains: "Our sweat is in the completion of 10.7 million tons of steel, our footprints are at the bottom of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, and we have also contributed to the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture." More than 700 students from four departments of Tsinghua University—Engineering Physics, Engineering Mechanics, Mathematics, and Automatic Control—rushed to the Songzhuang People's Commune in Tongzhou to harvest Chinese cabbage. During their spare time from labor, they investigated the attitudes of poor peasants, middle peasants, well-to-do middle peasants, rich peasants, and landlords toward the People's Communes. From the investigation, they learned that each class had different views on the People's Communes due to their different economic positions, and the views of poor peasants and middle peasants were generally very correct. In this way, the students increased their perceptual understanding of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, and at the same time improved their awareness, recognized the class struggle situation after the deepening of the socialist revolution, and strengthened their class viewpoint.

"Basket after basket of yellow sand has brought us closer to the working people; basket after basket of yellow sand has forged us into steel." This is the lyrics of a tamping song composed by the students during labor, which also summarizes the students' gains in labor. (Attached picture)

    参加公益劳动好处无穷
    首都十二万大学生通过实际锻炼觉悟不断提高
    本报讯　首都各高等学校有计划地组织师生参加社会公益劳动，并以此作为贯彻党的教育方针、培养又红又专的知识分子的一个重要措施。通过公益劳动，加强了学生和国家社会主义建设的联系，密切了知识分子和工农群众的关系。
    首都现有大学生十二万人。自去年春天以来，他们分批地参加了修建十三陵水库、大炼钢铁、人民公社的麦收、秋收、深翻土地、植树造林等劳动。今年暑期开学以后，他们又参加了修建密云水库、首都国庆工程、近郊各公社抢收大白菜、花生、白薯等劳动。在这一期间，他们共完成了二百万个工作日，相当于修建官厅水库所用劳动日总和的两倍。其中，挖土石方一百五十万，植树四万亩，整地五万三千亩，炼洋钢一千七百吨，土钢一千九百多吨。
    学生们在公益劳动中，把自己和国家的当前政治斗争紧密联系起来，受到了比较深刻的社会主义教育。最近在密云水库参加劳动的学生，看到这个工程原订第三个五年计划修建，现在在总路线的照耀下，边勘探、边设计、边准备、边施工，去年9月1日动工，今年8月就拦洪了，他们亲切地体会到总路线、大跃进和人民公社的无比生命力。有些原来内心对总路线、大跃进有不正确态度的师生，看到这种情况后，很快地就认识到自己的立场、思想和劳动人民不一致，表示要虚心向劳动人民学习。
    在劳动人民的感染下，多数师生也表现了顽强战斗、不怕困难的干劲。邮电学院的学生们在密云水库工地上清除拦洪坝坝头的淤泥时，不怕脏、不怕臭，跳进很深的污泥中坚持战斗。中国科学技术大学的许多学生不顾山高路险，在零度以下的天气里与五、六级的大风搏斗，终于在密云水库拦河坝东山上拦腰修起了横道，出色地提前完成了任务。去年大炼钢铁时，北京钢铁学院的两千多学生，分赴二十一个省市帮助各地建成了各种炼钢炉、炼铁炉两万五千多座，解决了提高钢铁质量有关的技术问题八百多项，发明创造、技术革新三千项。目前，在这些“小土群”的基础上逐步建成了“小洋群”，在炼钢中进一步发挥了作用。许多学生也学习了劳动人民崇高的自我牺牲精神。在炼钢运动中，清华大学学生杨洪士冒着浓烟和煤气，跳进高炉抢修，防止了高炉被烧坏的事故。
    通过公益劳动，学生们和工农建立了同呼吸共命运的感情。北京大学哲学系的学生在离开北京黄村人民公社时，农民远送十里，挥泪而别。今年6月黄村人民公社出现了小麦丰产田，第二天喜报就贴到远离数十里的北京大学，学生们欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。7月，公社受到涝灾，学生们坐立不安，纷纷要求回公社抗灾。北京钢铁学院有些学生谈起劳动收获时说：在完成一○七○万吨钢中有我们的汗滴，在十三陵水库的湖底有我们的足迹，在工农业大跃进中，也有我们的一份力量。清华大学工程物理、工程力学、数学、自动控制等四个系的七百多个学生，到通州宋庄人民公社抢收白菜，他们利用劳动的余暇，调查了贫农、中农、富裕中农、富农以及地主对人民公社的态度。从调查中，他们知道各阶层因自己的经济地位的不同，对人民公社都有着不同的看法，贫农、中农的看法一般是很正确的。这样，同学们都增加了学习八中全会文件的感性认识，同时也提高了觉悟，认清了社会主义革命深入后的阶级斗争形势，增强了阶级观点。
      “筐筐黄沙，拉近了我们和劳动人民的距离；筐筐黄沙，把我们锻炼成钢。”这是学生们在劳动中编的打夯歌的歌词，也概括了学生们在劳动中的收获。（附图片）
