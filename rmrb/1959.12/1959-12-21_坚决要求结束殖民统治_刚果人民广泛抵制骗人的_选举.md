　　Resolutely Demand an End to Colonial Rule
    Congolese People Widely Boycott Deceptive "Elections"
    Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 20th: The people of the Belgian Congo today boycotted the deceptive "elections" held by the colonial authorities in various cities of the Congo. In the capital, Leopoldville, the majority of the people responded to the call of the ABAKO party to boycott these "elections" and stayed home instead of voting. It is reported that Belgian colonial military police were on high alert. The city seemed to be in a state of semi-paralysis.
  In Matadi, the only seaport in the Congo, only 360 of the 12,000 voters deemed eligible by the colonial authorities registered to participate in the "elections."
    In the northern city of Stanleyville, the atmosphere was tense on the eve of the "elections." The colonial authorities specially dispatched troops to be stationed outside the central prison, where Congolese National Movement leader Lumumba, who had been on a hunger strike, was being detained. It is reported that in the Isangi area, about 100 kilometers northwest of the city, a soldier was stabbed to death when colonial troops suppressed local people's resistance on the 19th. According to reports, in some areas, the "elections" were difficult to conduct because there were neither candidates nor voters. Other reports said that many plantation workers refused to work to demonstrate against the colonialists.
    Belgian King Baudouin, who is currently touring the Congo, quietly left Stanleyville on the 19th and went to Usumbura, the capital of the Ruanda-Urundi region, a Belgian "trust territory." It is reported that he went there secretly to avoid encountering demonstrations by Congolese people in Usumbura demanding independence.
    Prior to the urban "elections" held on the 20th, the Belgian colonial authorities had been promoting these "elections" in rural areas for nearly two weeks, but they were widely boycotted by the Congolese people.

　　坚决要求结束殖民统治
    刚果人民广泛抵制骗人的“选举”
    新华社20日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比属刚果人民今天抵制殖民当局在刚果各个城市举行的欺骗性“选举”。在首府利奥波德维尔，大多数人民响应阿巴科党提出的抵制这次“选举”的号召，留在家里不去投票。据报道，比利时殖民军警严密戒备。城市似乎处于半瘫痪状态。
  在刚果唯一的海港马塔迪，被殖民当局认为合格的一万二千名选民中，只有三百六十人登记参加“选举”。
    在北部城市斯坦利维尔，“选举”前夕空气紧张，殖民当局特别派遣军队驻在中央监狱门外防备，在这个监狱内拘禁着刚果民族运动党领袖卢蒙巴，他曾经进行绝食斗争。在这个城市西北约一百公里的伊桑吉地区，殖民军队在19日镇压当地人民反抗行动时，有一名士兵被刺死。据消息说，有些地区，“选举”难以进行，因为既没有候选人也没有选民。还有消息说，许多种植园工人拒绝工作，对殖民主示威。
    目前正在刚果巡视的比利时国王博杜安19日悄悄地离开了斯坦利维尔，前往比利时“托管地”卢安达—乌隆迪区的首府乌松布拉。据报道，他秘密地前往那里，是为了避免遇到在乌松布拉的刚果人举行要求独立的示威。
    在20日举行城市“选举”以前，比利时殖民当局近两个星期以来就一直在乡村地区推行这种“选举”，可是却遭到了刚果人民的普遍抵制。
