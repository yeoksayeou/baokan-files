    People's Daily News: Shanghai Tongji University is launching a new upsurge of mass scientific research. After completing 103 projects to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day, teachers and students have successively proposed 580 more projects. Now 91% of the teachers and most of the senior students are participating in scientific research.

    Most of the 580 projects proposed this time are related to promoting industrial and agricultural construction and developing cultural undertakings. For example, in the field of building materials, in the key project of "Yangtze River Water Conservancy Hub," there are studies on "extra-large aggregate concrete" and "concrete plasticizers"; in the field of structures, there are studies on "Shanghai roof trusses" and "overall stability of the Yangtze River Bridge"; in the field of architectural design and urban-rural planning, there are studies on "planning and design of central residential areas in Shanghai County" and "planning and design of pilot residential areas in the southwestern district of Moscow" participating in international competitions; there are also many major projects in the fields of heating and water supply and drainage, architectural acoustics, and foundations.

    The combination of teachers and students, conducting in-depth practical investigations and research, identifying problems, finding materials, and determining urgently needed research projects are the characteristics of this mass scientific research campaign. Eighty teachers and fifth-year students of the water supply and drainage teaching and research group of the Urban Construction Department went to nine design institutes and more than 30 factories to investigate water supply and drainage problems in production, and determined 40 research projects, including key projects such as "water supply and drainage engineering design for film manufacturing plants." Teachers and students from the Architectural Engineering Department's design institute traveled to various theaters in Shanghai to investigate and collect data in order to design the first-class grand theater to be built in the Tilanqiao district. After analysis and research, they came up with a design scheme with the most ideal viewing angle and the clearest sound quality. Now they are conducting structural tests to find a new type of structure that saves the most materials.

    Another characteristic of this mass scientific research is the extensive collaboration inside and outside the university, which is closely integrated with teaching. The architectural teaching and research group of the Architectural Engineering Department collaborated with the urban and rural planning teaching and research group of the Urban Construction Department to study the "planning and design of pilot residential areas in the southwestern district of Moscow" for international competition. The steel and wood structure teaching and research group collaborated with the Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant to organize fifth-year students majoring in industrial and civil buildings to design the steel structure of the steel billet workshop as a course design. Teachers from the building materials teaching and research group of the Product Department, together with fourth-year students majoring in products and second-year students majoring in materials testing, collaborated with the Shanghai Institute of Building Materials Research to study projects such as silicate crystal embryos in combination with the teaching of cementitious material technology and non-metallic materials science.

    Fully leveraging the main role of teachers and the creativity and initiative of students to carry out teaching activities is the third characteristic of this mass scientific research. Fourth-year students majoring in roads of the Railway, Roads, Bridges, and Tunnels Department, under the leadership of the Party branch and the specific guidance of teachers, launched the "active reading" movement. In a short period of time, they not only made up for the lessons they had missed around the National Day, but also initially summarized a set of methods for mastering knowledge in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, which significantly improved the quality of learning, freeing up time to participate in scientific research.

    The rapid development of mass scientific research and creative teaching activities has further promoted teaching reform. For example, fifth-year students majoring in products in the Product Department have six courses scheduled for this semester according to the education plan. Due to students going to factories, through production labor, scientific research, and on-site teaching, they quickly mastered most of the content of courses such as "prefabricated component production technology," "organization and planning of building industrial enterprises," and "thermal insulation materials and products technology," freeing up a lot of time to connect with reality, study problems, and grasp the theory more thoroughly.

    This mass scientific research situation was formed on the basis of implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, raising ideological awareness, and continuing the Great Leap Forward. In this work, the school Party committee and administration further strengthened leadership, organized teachers and students to exchange experiences in teaching and scientific research, and strengthened the overall planning of school work.

    同济大学师生深入实际调查研究
    校内校外协作攻研科学
    本报讯　上海同济大学正在掀起一个群众性大搞科学研究的新高潮。全校师生继完成迎接国庆十周年的一百零三个项目以后，又陆续提出了五百八十个项目。现在91％的教师和大部分高年级学生都参加了科学研究工作。
    这一次提出的五百八十个项目，大部分与促进工农业建设和发展文化事业有关。例如，在建筑材料方面，在“长江水利枢纽”这一重点项目中，有“特大骨料混凝土”、“混凝土塑化剂”等的研究；在结构方面，有“上海屋架的研究”“长江大桥的整体稳定”等的研究；在建筑设计和城乡规划方面，有“上海县中心居民点规划设计”和参加国际竞赛的“莫斯科西南区试点居住区规划设计”等的研究；在供热供排水、建筑声学方面以及地基和基础方面都有许多重大项目。
    师生结合，深入实际进行调查研究，摸问题，找资料，确定急需研究的项目，是这次群众性大搞科学研究的特点。城市建设系给水排水教研组的教师和给水排水专业五年级学生八十人，深入九个设计院和三十多个工厂调查生产中的供水排水问题，确定了四十个研究项目，其中包括“胶片制造厂供排水工程设计”等重点项目。建筑工程系设计院的师生，为了设计即将在提篮桥区建设的第一流大剧院，跑遍了上海各个剧院，实地调查、收集资料，经过分析研究，得出一个视线最理想、音质最清晰的设计方案，现在他们又在进行结构试验，寻求一种最省材料的新型结构。
    这次群众性大搞科学研究的又一特点，是校内校外的广泛协作，并且同教学密切结合。建筑工程系建筑学教研组同城市建设系城乡规划教研组协作，研究“莫斯科西南区试点居住区规划设计”方案，准备参加国际竞赛。钢木结构教研组同上钢五厂协作，组织工业与民用建筑专业五年级学生进行钢胚车间的钢结构设计，作为课程设计。制品系建筑材料教研组教师同制品专业四年级学生和材料检验专业二年级学生，同上海市建筑材料研究所协作，结合胶凝物质工艺学和非金属材料学的教学，研究硅酸盐晶胚等项目。
    充分发挥教师的主要作用和学生的创造性和主动精神，开展教学活动，是这次群众性大搞科学研究的第三个特点。铁路道路桥隧系道路专业四年级的学生，在党支部的领导和教师的具体指导下，开展“活读书”运动，不仅在短短时间内补完了国庆节前后脱下来的功课，而且初步总结了一套多快好省地掌握知识的方法，使学习质量显著提高，可以腾出时间参加科学研究。
    群众性科学研究工作和创造性的教学活动的迅速发展，进一步推动了教学改革。如制品系制品专业五年级学生本学期按教育计划开出的六门课程，由于学生下厂，通过生产劳动、科学研究和现场教学，迅速掌握了“预制构件生产工艺学”、“建筑工业企业的组织和计划”以及“隔热材料和制品工艺学”等课程的大部分内容，腾出许多时间来联系实际，研究问题，更透彻地掌握理论。
    这一群众性的大搞科学研究的局面，是在贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，反右倾、鼓干劲，提高思想觉悟、继续跃进的基础上形成的。在这一工作中，学校党委和行政组织进一步加强了领导，组织师生交流了教学和科学研究的经验，加强了学校工作的全面规划。
