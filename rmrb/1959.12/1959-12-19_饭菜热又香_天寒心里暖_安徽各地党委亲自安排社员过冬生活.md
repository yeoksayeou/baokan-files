With More Enthusiasm, We Must Care More About the Masses' Lives
    Hot and Fragrant Food, Warm Hearts in the Cold
    Anhui Local Party Committees Personally Arrange Winter Life for Commune Members

    (By Our Newspaper) Anhui's various local People's Commune Party committees are concerned about the lives of commune members, and are actively arranging the winter work of the canteens, achieving "warm hearts in the cold, and hot and fragrant food."

    In Anhui's rural areas, peasant households participating in public canteens account for 90% of the province's total households. Since the beginning of winter, Party committees at all levels have personally taken charge of the winter work of the canteens. In mountainous and hilly areas, the communes have transferred some of the labor force to prepare a large amount of firewood for the canteens. In the Huaibei Plain in the Fuyang area, many public canteens also use biogas for cooking. There is also more winter vegetable planting and sun-drying of vegetables than in previous years. The pigs, chickens, and other livestock and poultry raised in the canteens in various places have also increased significantly. The four People's Communes in Xuji District, Liu'an County, have more than 1,900 canteens, and the people of the entire district eat in these canteens. These canteens plant 20,000 mu of vegetables, raise more than 10,000 pigs, more than 60,000 poultry, and 100,000 fish. They also have tofu workshops, sauce gardens, and snack departments, which provide very good meals for the commune members. They have hot food, hot dishes, hot water, dining halls, and dining tables. The commune members call the canteens "Happiness Halls."

    The local Party committees are even more concerned about the lives of the more than 5 million water conservancy workers in the province. The canteens at the construction sites have mostly been stocked with sufficient grain and firewood, and near some large and medium-sized construction sites, vegetables have been grown and pigs raised locally. The person in charge of the Party committee at the Huangdongshu Reservoir construction site in Quanjiao County personally helped more than 3,000 workers set up 24 canteens. Each canteen has established a management committee, and the workers' meals are very well prepared.

    The widely carried out kitchenware reform work in various places has not only saved a large number of labor force, but also diversified the meals for commune members, allowing for the processing of coarse grains into fine foods, and diverse food. The province has now reformed and promoted the use of more than 940,000 pieces of advanced cooking tools of various kinds, including noodle rolling machines, steamed bun machines, dumpling making machines, etc., overcoming the difficulties in the past where canteens had few staff and commune members rarely got to eat dumplings and noodles. After the more than 500 canteens of the Yuanqiang Commune in Taihe County basically achieved semi-mechanization of kitchen utensils, the number of cooks was reduced by half, and the food was made even better. The canteen of the Ruanlou Production Team in this commune can make more than ten kinds of food from sweet potatoes alone, such as pancakes, balls, vermicelli, and steamed buns.

    In order to do a good job in the winter work of the canteens, the Party committees in various places have also cultivated and selected model canteens, held on-site meetings, and promoted advanced experience in running canteens. After the Mengcheng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting at the Shao Weizhuang Canteen in the Sanyi Commune, the communes throughout the county learned and promoted the experiences of Shao Weizhuang Canteen in using biogas for cooking, reforming all cooking utensils, achieving self-flowing water, and diversifying food, which greatly improved the canteen work in the county, making the dishes hot and the food fragrant. Some Party member leading cadres of communes and production teams also personally went to the canteens to help improve the work.

    干劲越足，越要关心群众生活
    饭菜热又香　天寒心里暖
    安徽各地党委亲自安排社员过冬生活
    本报讯　安徽各地人民公社党委关心社员生活，积极安排食堂的过冬工作，做到“天寒心里暖，饭菜热又香”。
    安徽农村参加公共食堂的农户已占全省总农户数的90％。入冬以来，各地党委都亲自抓食堂的过冬工作。在山区和丘陵地区，各公社都抽调了一部分劳动力，给食堂准备了大量的柴草。处于淮北平原的阜阳专区，很多公共食堂还利用沼气做饭。种冬菜、晒干菜也比往年多得多。各地食堂养的猪和鸡等家畜家禽也增加了很多。六安县徐集区的四个人民公社有一千九百多个食堂，全区人民都在食堂里吃饭，这些食堂种菜两万亩，养猪一万多头，养家禽六万多只，养鱼十万尾，并有豆腐坊、酱园和小吃部，把社员们的生活调剂得很好，做到了有热饭、有热菜、有开水、有饭厅、有餐桌，社员们都把食堂称为“幸福堂”。
    全省五百多万治水民工的生活问题，各地党委更为关心。工地上的食堂大都已备足了粮食和柴草，有些大中型工程的工地附近，还就地种了菜、养了猪。全椒县黄栋树水库工地党委负责人亲自帮助三千多民工办了二十四个食堂，每个食堂都成立了管理委员会，民工伙食调剂得很好。
    各地普遍开展的炊具改革工作，不但节省了大批的劳动力，而且也为调剂社员伙食，做到粗粮细作、饭菜多样化。全省现已改革和推广使用的各种先进炊事工具，共达九十四万多件，其中有轧面条机、做馒头机、包饺子机等工具，克服了过去食堂人手少社员难得吃上饺子和面条等困难。太和县原墙公社五百多个食堂，在基本上实现了炊具半机械化以后，炊事人员节省了一半，而且把饭菜做得更好。这个公社的阮楼生产队的食堂，单甘薯一项，就能做出煎饼、丸子、粉丝、馒头等十多种花样的饭菜。
    各地党委为了做好食堂的过冬工作，还培养和选出了模范食堂，召开现场会议，推广办食堂的先进经验。中共蒙城县委在三义公社的邵魏庄食堂召开了现场会以后，全县各公社学习和推广了邵魏庄食堂烧饭用沼气、炊具全部改革、用水达到自流化和饭菜多样化等经验，使全县的食堂工作有了很大改进，大都做到菜热饭香。有些公社和生产队的党员负责干部，还亲自到食堂里帮助改进工作。
