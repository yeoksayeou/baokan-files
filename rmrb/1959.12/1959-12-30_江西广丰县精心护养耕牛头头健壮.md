Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, Carefully Nurses Plough Cattle, Ensuring Each is Strong and Healthy

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, is comprehensively strengthening the winter nursing and management of plough cattle.

　　In the two months since winter began, the 41,000 head of plough cattle in Guangfeng County, under the meticulous care of the commune members, have all grown strong and healthy. According to the latest statistics after the winter plough cattle appraisal carried out by various communes, 38,700 head of plough cattle in the county (accounting for 94.4% of the total number of plough cattle) have gained more weight than before winter. The remaining 2,300 old and weak plough cattle have also achieved winter weight retention, are disease-free, and there have been no deaths.

　　Guangfeng County's winter plough cattle nursing work has been successful primarily because Party organizations at all levels have strengthened their leadership in this work. Throughout the county, from the county Party committee to the Party committees of various communes and the Party branches of production teams, a secretary or head of the commune (team) has been designated to be specifically responsible for plough cattle nursing work.  The feeders generally adhere to "three grasps and three diligences," that is, grasp ideology and diligently educate feeders to attach importance to nursing work; grasp measures and diligently check the implementation of various wintering measures; grasp body condition and frequently carry out plough cattle appraisal work. When Zhou Jingshan, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, inspected work at the Wufengshan Reclamation Farm, he discovered that the farm had not reserved enough winter feed for its 30-plus head of plough cattle. He immediately convened a cadre meeting, and everyone brainstormed ways to increase the amount of sweet potato vines and ten catties of rice bran for each head of plough cattle. Secondly, they improved feeding management to ensure dry stalls and full feeding. Winter plough cattle are mainly kept in stalls, so it is first necessary to reserve enough feed for the winter. Guangfeng County's various communes have consistently adopted the method of "quantitative allocation to cattle and designated personnel for safekeeping" for reserving feed, dividing plough cattle into three grades based on their size and labor strength to determine the amount of feed.

　　In terms of feeding management, the "five diligences and three cleans" system (that is, diligent grazing, diligent watering, diligent bedding of stalls, diligent feeding, diligent inspection, clean feed, clean cattle stalls, and clean cattle bodies) has been widely promoted. Each cow is grazed once in the morning and once in the afternoon to invigorate blood and strengthen tendons; water is given two to three times a day, and warm water is given to the cattle in cold weather, with a small amount of salt added; the cattle stalls are frequently cleaned of manure and straw is frequently added to keep the stalls clean and dry; feeding is done in small, frequent meals, with some vegetable leaves and green grass added appropriately each time.

　　In order to encourage the feeders to raise the plough cattle well, the county also launched regular plough cattle appraisal activities. Feeders who do a good job in feeding and management are commended and rewarded as models; those who cause cattle to lose weight or become sick due to poor feeding management are given appropriate criticism or have work points deducted depending on the circumstances, which greatly enhances the feeders' enthusiasm for caring for the plough cattle.

　　江西广丰县精心护养耕牛头头健壮
    本报讯　江西广丰县全面加强冬季耕牛护养管理。
    入冬两个多月来，广丰县四万一千头耕牛，在社员的精心护养下，头头生长健壮。据最近各个公社开展冬季耕牛评比后的统计，全县有三万八千七百头耕牛（占耕牛总数的94.4％）体膘都比入冬前长得壮，其余二千三百头老弱耕牛也做到了冬季保膘、无病、无死亡。
    广丰县冬季耕牛护养工作做得好，首先是各级党组织加强了这一工作的领导。全县从县委到各公社党委、生产队党支部，都确定了一名书记或社（队）长，专管耕牛护养工作。饲养员一般做到了“三抓、三勤”，即抓思想，勤教育饲养员重视护养工作；抓措施，勤检查各项过冬措施的贯彻执行情况；抓体膘，经常开展耕牛的评比工作。县委第一书记周景山在五峰山垦殖场检查工作时，发现该场三十多头耕牛过冬饲料留得不够，当即召开了干部会，大家想办法，为每头耕牛增加了一部分红薯藤和十斤米糠。其次改进饲养管理，做到栏干食饱。冬季耕牛以栏养为主，因此首先必须留足过冬的饲料。广丰县各个公社对留饲料一贯采取了“定量到牛，定人保管”的办法，按牛的大小、劳力强弱不同，把耕牛分为三等评定饲料。
    在饲养管理方面，各地普遍推行了“五勤三净”（即勤放牧、勤给水、勤垫栏、勤喂料、勤检查，饲料净、牛栏净、牛体净）制度。每头牛每天上午下午放牧一次，活血健筋；每天给水两至三次，大寒天气给牛饮温水，并加入少量的食盐；牛栏做到勤出粪勤垫草，经常保持栏内清洁干燥；喂料时少吃多餐，每次都适当的加些菜叶、青草。
    为了鼓励饲养员把耕牛养好，全县还开展了定期的耕牛评比活动。喂养工作搞得好的饲养员，评模奖励；对因饲养管理不善，造成牛退膘生病的，根据情况给予适当的批评或者扣工分，这就大大的提高了饲养员护理耕牛的积极性。
