The Paraguayan people's struggle against the pro-American dictatorial regime is entering a new stage. The current situation in Paraguay is characterized by the increasingly acute contradiction between U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Stroessner group, and the Paraguayan nation and people, as the United States, through its puppet regime, intensifies its plunder and control of Paraguay and tries to turn it into a U.S. military base. Although the dictatorial government is stepping up its bloody suppression, workers, farmers, university students and other intellectuals, and even many members of the ruling National Republican Party, are increasingly joining the anti-dictatorship struggle and have begun to form a united front organization for the anti-dictatorship struggle—the Paraguayan National Liberation United Front. The armed struggle that broke out on December 12, with the support of the Paraguayan National Liberation United Front and the Paraguayan Communist Party, vigorously coordinated and strengthened the armed struggle launched earlier by farmers in some parts of Paraguay, deepening the crisis of the Stroessner dictatorial regime.

Paraguay is the last military dictatorship in South America. For twenty years, the Paraguayan people have been under cruel dictatorial rule. The dictators come and go, but all these people serve one master—American monopoly capital.

The forces of American monopoly capital penetrated Paraguay as early as the First World War. During the Second World War, by supporting the puppet Morinigo to power (1940-1948), American monopoly capital replaced the forces of Britain and Argentina in Paraguay and gained privileges to control Paraguay's domestic trade, mining, transportation, etc. In July 1950, Chavez of the National Republican Party was elected president, intensified the implementation of dictatorial rule internally, and his tendency to rely on the United States became more obvious externally. In May 1954, the United States instigated its loyal servant Stroessner to launch a military coup, further controlling Paraguay. In July of the same year, under the manipulation of the U.S. Embassy, Stroessner was "elected" president. Another "election" was held in February 1958, and Stroessner was "re-elected" president as the only candidate.

Since the Stroessner group was brought to power by the United States, in order to maintain his rule, he further sacrificed the interests of the nation and the people to serve the United States. Stroessner himself, in an interview with the press in 1955, claimed that he regarded the U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay, Mr. Eagelton, as his government's "minister without portfolio." In fact, the U.S. ambassador has become the governor of Paraguay.

Oil is Paraguay's main resource. In 1945, the U.S. California United Oil Company obtained the right to explore and exploit oil in the Chaco region for fifty years. Although they left there two years later, after Stroessner came to power, they returned to Paraguay in the second half of 1955 to exploit oil in the Chaco. In the autumn of 1957, four U.S. oil companies even "leased" 300,350 hectares of oil-bearing land from the Stroessner group. As a result, U.S. oil companies have actually become the "plenipotentiary masters" of Paraguay's oil industry.

The Stroessner dictatorial regime's traitorous policy facilitated the control and plunder of Paraguay by American monopoly capital. Most of the vast fertile land suitable for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry has fallen into the hands of American monopoly capital. The U.S. Johnson Coffee Company alone occupies 300,000 hectares, while 94% of Paraguayan farmers are landless. The U.S. "International Products Corporation" and another British company completely control the meat processing industry of this small South American country. At the same time, in order to facilitate economic plunder, the United States is building highways and airports under the guise of "developing" Paraguay's "transportation industry."

Since Paraguay was the first Latin American country to accept the U.S. "Point Four Program" in 1950, its financial economy is controlled by the United States. In 1957, in order to obtain a loan of ten million U.S. dollars from the "International Monetary Fund" and the U.S. Export-Import Bank controlled by the United States, the Stroessner dictatorial regime accepted the "economic stabilization plan" formulated by the United States, and implemented measures such as free exchange of foreign exchange, abolition of import restrictions, freezing of wages, dismissal of workers, and increased taxes, resulting in increasingly serious inflation and currency devaluation. Before the implementation of the "economic stabilization plan," the official exchange rate between the Paraguayan currency Guarani and the U.S. dollar was sixty to one. By March 1, 1959, it had fallen to one hundred and thirty to one. The devaluation of the Paraguayan currency means that American monopoly capital can buy Paraguayan agricultural products and industrial raw materials at low prices and pay meager wages to employees. For the vast number of Paraguayan people, it means rising prices, unemployment, hunger, and being forced to flee abroad to seek a way out.

While carrying out cruel economic plunder of the Paraguayan people, the United States is also intensifying its military expansion in Paraguay. Since Paraguay is located in the heart of the Latin American continent, adjacent to Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia, the United States attaches great importance to Paraguay's position in its plan to control South America. The United States not only pulled Paraguay into the "Rio de Janeiro Treaty" and the "South Atlantic Treaty Organization," attempting to drive the Paraguayan people to serve as cannon fodder for the United States, but also stepped up its efforts to turn Paraguay into its "intercontinental strategic base." This plan includes the establishment of an atomic plant in the Salto del Guaira region, accelerating the construction of highways and laying an oil pipeline in order to transport Paraguayan oil to the Atlantic coast to supply the U.S. fleet. In addition, the United States has stationed a military delegation in Paraguay and built air force bases in the Chaco and other regions. Every agency of the Paraguayan government, including the military, has American advisors and agents. Through these measures, the United States firmly controls Paraguay in its own hands.

Since the Stroessner group's foreign policy is to follow the lead of the United States, it is bound to implement a policy of terror internally, destroying the people's democratic freedoms and rights. All opposition parties except the ruling party have been declared illegal. In October 1955, the Paraguayan government passed a decree to suppress the Communist Party. In December of the same year, it promulgated a decree prohibiting the activities of all patriotic organizations, restricting freedom of the press and association, and arresting and persecuting Communists and trade union leaders. Many patriots who expressed dissatisfaction with the traitorous dictatorial regime, including opposition figures in the ruling party, have been subjected to crazy persecution - torture, imprisonment, expulsion, and shooting. Prisons and concentration camps are filled with political prisoners. And it is Earl K. Tilley, an agent of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and a U.S. Army colonel, who plans various tortures and terrorist activities for Stroessner's police.

The abject poverty, hunger, and police terror resulting from the Stroessner group's traitorous policies have forced one-third of Paraguay's 1.6 million residents to leave their country and flee to Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Chile.

However, despite the cruel and bloody rule imposed on the Paraguayan people by the United States in collusion with the Stroessner group, the flames of the Paraguayan people's movement for democratic freedom and national independence are burning more and more fiercely. In April 1958, the "Free Citizen Army for Paraguay's Freedom" appeared in southern Paraguay. In August and September of the same year, a large-scale, nationwide general strike broke out. After this, there were two more large-scale nationwide struggles against the Stroessner regime's brutal behavior in Villarrica, Paraguay's second largest city. Subsequently, armed peasant struggles took place in Concepcion, San Jose, Encarnacion and other places.

In January 1959, the victory of the Cuban people in overthrowing the Batista dictatorial regime greatly encouraged and promoted the Paraguayan people's anti-dictatorship struggle. Paraguay's domestic situation became increasingly unstable, and exiles abroad organized anti-dictatorship struggle organizations. In February, anti-dictatorship armed masses in the Capitan Meza area on the Parana River clashed with the dictatorial government's army. In the same month, Paraguayan exiles in Uruguay established the Paraguayan National Liberation United Front, which included the Liberal Party, the February Party, the Communist Party, democratic patriotic elements in the ruling party, and Catholics. The purpose of this organization is to lead and promote the Paraguayan people's struggle to overthrow the Stroessner dictatorship and establish a national democratic provisional government. From May to June, mass rallies, demonstrations and strikes were held in the capital and other cities, strongly protesting Stroessner's dictatorial rule. The recent outbreak of armed struggle has further strengthened the momentum of the Paraguayan people's anti-dictatorship struggle.

Under the pressure of the increasingly high tide of the people's movement, the Stroessner dictatorial regime has long been in a precarious state. Its survival is due, on the one hand, to the support of the U.S. State Department and the Paraguayan reactionary army, and, more importantly, to the fact that the anti-dictatorship forces have not yet fully and unreservedly united to fight together.

The Paraguayan Communist Party has done a great deal of work to establish a national united front against the dictatorship, calling on the people to rise up and establish a democratic provisional government more than once. The Paraguayan Communist Party has also called on the Paraguayan people more than once that, once armed action occurs, whether it is a military coup or Paraguayan exiles entering Paraguay from abroad to carry out armed struggle, the Paraguayan patriotic people should immediately mobilize to turn the coup and armed action into a genuine revolutionary movement.

Now, although the armed action of the Paraguayan people's anti-dictatorship struggle has broken out and is developing smoothly, the Paraguayan people's struggle is still arduous and complex. This is mainly because the united front of the Paraguayan people's anti-dictatorship struggle still needs to be strengthened and expanded.

However, the current situation is very favorable to the Paraguayan people. Internationally, the Paraguayan people's struggle is not isolated. This struggle is a link in the increasingly high tide of the national democratic struggle throughout Latin America, and they are supported by the people of Latin America and the world. A powerful people's solidarity movement has emerged domestically. The Paraguayan National Liberation United Front has issued a statement calling on Paraguayans to fully support the armed struggle, and also calling on all Paraguayans belonging to various parties, with various different ideas and beliefs, to unite like steel in the struggle against tyrannical rule. A recent statement issued in Buenos Aires by a delegation from the Guiding Committee of the Paraguayan Communist Party on the current situation in Paraguay pointed out that the Paraguayan people’s “current task is to find ways to make the armed struggle grow and strengthen, closely integrate it with the struggles of workers, farmers, students and all the people, so that the armed uprising becomes a genuine people’s revolution, and fight for the destruction and complete elimination of the police military regime, for democratic land reform, for the eradication of North American control in our country, and for the restoration of national independence.” The statement emphasized that the fundamental condition for achieving victory in the struggle is the unity of the entire nation, regardless of political or religious beliefs. Eduardo Cabrera, one of the main leaders of the Paraguayan revolutionary movement, also called on Paraguayans to unite at this historic moment. "The Anti-Dictatorship Army" also called on the Paraguayan people to participate in the struggle against "Stroessner and his minions' bloody tyranny." With the development of the armed struggle, the united front of the Paraguayan people's anti-dictatorship struggle will inevitably expand and consolidate. Due to the enthusiastic participation of the Paraguayan people in the struggle, workers have held large-scale general strikes, workers and students have fought in the streets, volunteers have joined the armed struggle one after another, and some people in the government army have also joined the ranks of the armed struggle, and farmers in some places have also taken up weapons to fight for land. Therefore, the spirit of overthrowing the dictatorship by force through revolutionary methods has been widely promoted. With the development of the armed struggle, the people's character of this struggle will inevitably be strengthened. In this situation, the crisis of the dictatorial regime is deepening, and the already existing divisions within the dictatorial regime and between the government and the military are also deepening. This situation shows that as long as the united front of the anti-dictatorship struggle can be continuously consolidated and expanded and persists in the struggle, turning the current armed struggle into a genuine national democratic revolution, it can completely destroy the dictatorial system in the united struggle of the people and establish a democratic provisional government representing all factions in the country.

　　巴拉圭人民反独裁政权的斗争
　　章叶
    巴拉圭人民反对亲美独裁政权的斗争，正在进入一个新的阶段。目前巴拉圭局势的特点是：由于美国通过它的傀儡政权加紧对巴拉圭的掠夺和控制，并竭力把它变成美国的军事基地，美帝国主义及其走狗斯特罗斯纳集团同巴拉圭民族和人民之间的矛盾，越来越尖锐化。虽然独裁政府加紧血腥镇压，但工人、农民、大学生和其他知识分子，甚至执政党国家共和党的许多党员，越来越多地投入反独裁斗争，并且开始组成反独裁斗争的统一战线组织——巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线。12月12日爆发的武装斗争，得到了巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线和巴拉圭共产党的支持，有力地配合和壮大了巴拉圭某些地方的农民早先发起的武装斗争，加深了斯特罗斯纳独裁政权的危机。
    巴拉圭是南美洲最后一个军事独裁国家。二十年来，巴拉圭人民一直处于残酷的独裁统治之下。独裁者换来换去，但是，所有这些人都是为一个主子——美国垄断资本服务的。
    美国垄断资本的势力，早在第一次世界大战时就侵入了巴拉圭。在第二次世界大战期间，由于把傀儡摩林尼哥扶植上台（1940—1948年）。美国垄断资本在巴拉圭取代英国、阿根廷的势力而占优势，并获得控制巴拉圭国内贸易、采矿、交通等特权。1950年7月，国家共和党查维斯当选总统，对内加紧实行独裁统治，对外投靠美国的倾向更为明显。1954年5月，美国又策动它的忠实奴仆斯特罗斯纳发动军事政变，更进一步控制了巴拉圭。同年7月，在美国大使馆的操纵下，斯特罗斯纳“当选”总统。1958年2月举行另一次“选举”，斯特罗斯纳作为唯一的候选人再度“当选”总统。
    斯特罗斯纳集团既然是由美国一手扶植上台的，为了维持他的统治，就进一步牺牲民族和人民的利益为美国效劳。斯特罗斯纳本人在1955年对报界的一次谈话中，就自称他把美国驻巴拉圭大使艾吉敦当作他的政府中的“不管部长”。实际上美国大使已经成了巴拉圭的总督。
    石油是巴拉圭的主要资源，在1945年，美国加利福尼亚联合石油公司就得到在大厦谷地区勘探和开采石油五十年的权利。两年后他们虽然离开了那里，可是在斯特罗斯纳上台后，他们在1955年下半年又回到巴拉圭来开采大厦谷的石油。1957年秋天，四家美国石油公司更从斯特罗斯纳集团手中“租借”到三十万零三百五十公顷蕴藏石油的土地的租让权。这样一来，美国的石油公司实际上已经成为巴拉圭石油工业的“全权主人”。
    斯特罗斯纳独裁政权的卖国政策，便利了美国垄断资本对巴拉圭的控制和掠夺。广大的适于发展农牧业的肥沃土地，大都落在美国垄断资本的手里，仅美国约翰逊咖啡公司一家，就占地三十万公顷，而巴拉圭无地的农民却占农民总数的94％。美国的“国际产品公司”和另一家英国公司完全操纵了这个南美小国的肉类加工业。同时，为了便于经济上的掠夺，美国正在“发展”巴拉圭的“交通运输业”的幌子下修筑公路和机场。
    由于巴拉圭在1950年作为拉丁美洲第一个国家接受美国“第四点计划”，它的财政经济都受美国的控制。1957年，斯特罗斯纳独裁政权为了取得美国控制的“国际货币基金组织”和美国进出口银行一千万美元的贷款，接受美国拟定的“稳定经济计划”，在国内实行外汇自由兑换、取消进口限制、冻结工资、解雇工人、增加税收等措施，结果造成了日益严重的通货膨胀和货币贬值。在实行“稳定经济计划”前，巴拉圭货币瓜拉尼同美元的官方兑换率是六十比一，到1959年3月1日，下降到一百三十比一。巴拉圭货币的贬值，意味着美国垄断资本能够以低价收购巴拉圭的农产品和工业原料，并且支付职工微薄的工资，而对于巴拉圭广大人民来说，则是物价高涨、失业、饥饿和被迫流亡国外寻找出路。
    美国在对巴拉圭人民实行残酷的经济掠夺的同时，还变本加厉地对巴拉圭进行军事扩张。由于巴拉圭位于拉丁美洲大陆的心脏地带，与阿根廷、巴西和玻利维亚为邻，美国在它控制南美的计划中非常重视巴拉圭所处的地位。美国不仅把巴拉圭拉入“里约热内卢条约”和“南大西洋公约组织”，企图驱使巴拉圭人民充当美国的炮灰，并且还加紧把巴拉圭变成它的“洲际战略基地”，这个计划包括在萨尔托德尔瓜伊拉地区建立一所原子工厂，加紧建设公路和敷设一条油管，以便把巴拉圭的石油运送到大西洋岸来供应美国舰队。此外，美国在巴拉圭派驻军事代表团，在大厦谷等地区建有空军基地。巴拉圭政府的每一个机关，包括军队在内，都有美国的顾问和代理人。美国通过这些措施把巴拉圭牢牢地控制在自己手中。
    斯特罗斯纳集团的对外政策既然是唯美国马首是瞻，对内就必然实行恐怖统治，摧残人民的民主自由权利。除了执政党以外，所有的反对党都被宣布为非法。1955年10月巴拉圭政府通过了一项镇压共产党的法令，同年12月又颁布法令禁止所有爱国团体活动，限制新闻和结社自由，逮捕和迫害共产党人与工会领袖。许多对卖国独裁政权表示不满的爱国者，包括执政党中的反对派人士在内，遭到疯狂的迫害——拷打、监禁、驱逐出境和枪杀。监狱和集中营中关满了政治犯。而为斯特罗斯纳的警察策划各种酷刑和恐怖活动的是美国联邦调查局的一个密探、美国陆军上校尔·克·提尔里。
    斯特罗斯纳集团卖国政策产生的赤贫、饥饿和警察恐怖手段，使巴拉圭一百六十万居民中的三分之一的居民，不得不离开自己的祖国，流亡在阿根廷、乌拉圭、巴西和智利等国。
    但是，尽管美国勾结斯特罗斯纳集团对巴拉圭人民施行残酷的血腥统治，巴拉圭人民争取民主自由和民族独立运动的火焰却越来越炽烈地燃烧起来了。1958年4月，在巴拉圭南部曾经出现过“争取巴拉圭自由公民军”。同年8、9月间爆发了一次规模宏大、席卷全国的总罢工。在这以后又发生了两次规模巨大的全民性的斗争，反对斯特罗斯纳政权在巴拉圭第二大城维拉里卡的残暴行为。接着，在公塞普森、圣约瑟和恩卡尔纳松和其他一些地方，发生了农民武装斗争。
    1959年1月，古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的胜利，大大鼓舞和推动了巴拉圭人民的反独裁斗争。巴拉圭的国内局势日益不稳，国外流亡人士纷纷组织反独裁斗争的组织。2月间，巴拉圭反独裁的武装群众在巴拉那河上的卡比坦·麦萨地区同独裁政府军队发生冲突。同月，巴拉圭在乌拉圭的流亡者成立了巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线，参加的有自由党、二月党、共产党、执政党中的民主爱国分子和天主教徒。这个组织的宗旨是领导和推动巴拉圭人民推翻斯特罗斯纳独裁统治和建立全国性的民主临时政府的斗争。5—6月间，在首都和其他城市举行了群众大会、游行示威和罢工，强烈抗议斯特罗斯纳的独裁统治。最近，爆发的武装斗争，更加强了巴拉圭 人民的反独裁斗争的声势。
    在日益高涨的人民运动的压力下，斯特罗斯纳独裁政权早已处于风雨飘摇之中。其所以免于崩溃，一方面是由于美国国务院和巴拉圭反动军队的支持，而更重要的是由于反独裁的力量还没有完全和毫无例外地团结起来，共同进行斗争。
    巴拉圭共产党为建立全民团结的反独裁统一战线进行了巨大工作，不只一次地号召人民举行起义，建立民主化的临时政府。巴拉圭共产党还不只一次地号召巴拉圭人民，一旦发生武装行动，不论是军事政变还是流亡的巴拉圭人从国外进入巴拉圭进行武装斗争，巴拉圭爱国人民就要立刻动员起来，使政变和武装行动变成真正的革命运动。
    现在，巴拉圭人民反独裁斗争的武装行动虽然已经爆发，并且正在顺利发展中，但是，巴拉圭人民的斗争仍然是艰巨而复杂的。这主要是因为巴拉圭人民反独裁斗争的统一战线还需要加强和壮大。
    但是，目前的形势非常有利于巴拉圭人民。在国际方面，巴拉圭人民的斗争并不是孤立的。这个斗争是整个拉丁美洲日益高涨的民族民主斗争的一环，他们获得拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的支持。在国内已经出现了强大的人民团结运动。巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线已经发表声明号召巴拉圭人全力支持武装斗争，还号召属于各党派、具有各种不同思想和信仰的所有巴拉圭人，在反对暴政统治的斗争中钢铁般地团结起来。巴拉圭共产党指导委员会代表团最近在布宜诺斯艾利斯就巴拉圭目前的形势发表的一项声明指出，巴拉圭人民“当前的任务是想尽办法使武装斗争成长壮大，同工人、农民、学生和全体人民的斗争紧密结合起来，以便使武装起义成为真正的人民革命，为争取摧毁和彻底消灭警察军事政权，争取民主土地改革，争取铲除北美在我国的控制，争取恢复民族独立而斗争。”声明并强调指出，取得斗争胜利的根本条件是全国人民不分政治和宗教信仰的团结一致。巴拉圭革命运动的主要领导人之一爱德华·卡布雷拉也号召巴拉圭人在这个具有历史意义的时刻团结一致。”反独裁军也号召巴拉圭人民参加反对“斯特罗斯纳和他的仆从的血腥暴政”的斗争。随着武装斗争的发展，巴拉圭人民反独裁斗争的统一战线必然日益扩大和巩固。由于巴拉圭人民热情地参加斗争，工人举行了规模巨大的总罢工，工人和学生在街上进行了战斗，志愿人员纷纷参加武装斗争，政府军中也有一些人加入武装斗争的队伍，有些地方农民也拿起了武器争取土地，因此通过武力用革命方法推翻独裁政权的精神已经普遍地发扬起来。随着武装斗争的发展，这个斗争的人民性也必然日益加强。在这种情况下，独裁政权的危机日益深重，早已存在的独裁政权内部和政府与军队之间的分歧也日益加深。这个形势表明，只要反独裁斗争的统一战线能够不断巩固和扩大并且坚持斗争，把目前的武装斗争变成一个真正的民族民主革命，就能在人民的联合斗争中彻底摧毁独裁制度，建立一个代表全国各派势力的民主临时政府。
