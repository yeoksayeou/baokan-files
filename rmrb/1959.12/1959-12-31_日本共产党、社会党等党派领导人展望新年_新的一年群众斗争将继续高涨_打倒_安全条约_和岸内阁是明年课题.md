Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 28th: Leaders of the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and mass organizations have delivered speeches summarizing the great achievements of the Japanese people's struggle this year. They also resolutely stated that they will fight to the end in the New Year to strive for the establishment of a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan.

    Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Nosaka Sanzō, pointed out that the changes in the international situation this year have played a huge and beneficial role in the struggle of the Japanese people, creating favorable conditions for uniting more and more people to participate in the struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty."

    He emphasized that over the past year, the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" has penetrated into all levels of the people, and the scale of the struggle far exceeded the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" last year. This struggle has forced the US imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party into trouble, and finally forced the US imperialism hidden behind the scenes to personally come forward to urge the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet to revise the "Security Treaty" and accelerate the arms expansion.

    Nosaka stated that in order to make the New Year a historically significant year for the development of the struggle to establish a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan, the Japanese Communist Party will organize and launch various forms of mass actions from the first day, in coordination with the struggle in the Diet, and launch a fierce attack to crush the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party.

    Chairman of the Socialist Party, Suzuki Mosaburo, stated that the Socialist Party will further develop this struggle based on the achievements of this year's rising struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    Suzuki said that the struggle to establish a peaceful and neutral Japanese government is still very difficult, but it is a struggle with hope of victory.

    He emphasized that overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is the task for next year. Therefore, the most important thing is for the democratic forces to unite and launch a joint struggle against the main enemy.

    Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Ōta Kaoru, after summarizing the achievements of the Japanese working class's struggle over the past year, emphasized that the Japanese working class has rapidly raised its political consciousness and strengthened its unity through these struggles. The Japanese working class has exerted a huge force and has been standing at the forefront, launching a struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    He also pointed out that the struggle of Japanese workers to safeguard their rights and oppose "enterprise rationalization" has also made great progress this year.

    Ōta pointed out that next year is an important year to determine the fate of the Japanese nation, and it is a decisive year for the struggle to break the war system, strive for independence, democracy, neutrality, and improve living standards. He stated that the General Council is determined to stand at the forefront, unite the entire Japanese people, and fight for the national cause of forcing monopoly capital into isolation and smashing the "security system."

    Chairman of the National Federation of Farmers' Associations of Japan, Nozoe Masaru, pointed out that Japanese farmers' organizations completed their unification this year, and there has been concrete progress in worker-peasant cooperation, which is a historically significant event in the farmers' struggle.

    He emphasized the great significance of farmers starting to participate in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty." He said that this means that farmers are exerting their huge vitality by participating in the struggle.

    Nozoe stated that in order to strive for Japan's complete independence, farmers will further strengthen cooperation with the working class.

    Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Yasui Iku, pointed out that the broad masses of people united around the council have overcome the political oppression of the reactionaries and have stood up to launch a struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty." This means that in the upcoming New Year, the conditions have been created for Japan's peace movement to take another step towards striving for a permanent end to nuclear weapons testing and complete and thorough disarmament.

    Yasui stated that next year, the council will further unite the tens of millions of people participating in the struggle, launch a large-scale movement to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and oppose nuclear armament, and promote the change of the reactionary policy of dispatching troops abroad to participate in the war.

    Director of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, Kazami Akira, pointed out that in order to fight against imperialism, the movement to strive for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations will occupy a very important position next year.

    When talking about the fact that US imperialism also has to sing the tune of "peace," Kazami said that it is extremely important for us to fight against "hypocritical" peace movements and "anti-communist" activities.

    Executive Director of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, Suzuki Kazuo, pointed out that this year, the Japanese economic community has launched a more active movement than the previous year by assisting Tanzan Ishibashi and Kenzo Matsumura in visiting China and convening manufacturers' conferences to demand the opening of the deadlock in Japan-China relations. This means that the demand to open the deadlock in Japan-China relations has penetrated and expanded to the entire economic community, including major manufacturers, and has begun to exert its potential power. This power will definitely play a greater role next year.

    Suzuki said that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is currently only trying to prolong its life and adhere to its rule, and the Japanese economic community's dissatisfaction with it is increasing day by day.

    After a period of persistent struggle, the Japanese people finally broke through the armed police defense line of the Kishi government and entered the Diet to express to the congressmen their wish to oppose the new US-Japan military alliance.

　　日本共产党、社会党等党派领导人展望新年
    新的一年群众斗争将继续高涨
    打倒“安全条约”和岸内阁是明年课题
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本共产党、社会党和群众团体领袖分别发表讲话，总结了今年日本人民斗争的巨大成就，同时坚决表示，将在新的一年中为争取建立和平、独立、民主、中立的日本而斗争到底。
    日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三指出，今年国际形势的变化对日本人民的斗争起了巨大的有益作用，为团结更加广泛的人民参加阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”斗争创造了良好的条件。
    他强调说，一年来阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争深入到各阶层人民，斗争规模之大远超过了去年反对修改“警职法”的斗争。这个斗争迫使美帝国主义和岸信介内阁以及自由民主党陷入困境，使隐藏在幕后的美帝国主义终于不得不亲自出面来催促岸信介内阁修改“安全条约”，加速扩军。
    野坂表示，为了使新的一年成为争取建立和平、独立、民主、中立的日本的斗争发展的具有历史意义的一年，日本共产党将从第一天起组织和展开各种形式的群众行动，配合国会的斗争，发动粉碎岸信介内阁和自由民主党阴谋的猛烈攻击。
    社会党委员长铃木茂三郎表示，社会党将以今年高涨的阻止修改“安全条约”斗争的成就为基础，进一步发展这个斗争。
    铃木说，为建立和平、中立的日本政府的斗争虽然还很艰苦，但是这是有胜利希望的斗争。
    他强调指出，打倒岸信介内阁是明年的课题。因此，最重要的是民主力量团结起来对主要敌人展开联合斗争。
    日本工会总评议会议长太田熏总结了一年来日本工人阶级斗争的成就后强调指出，日本工人阶级通过这些斗争迅速提高了工人阶级的政治觉悟，并且加强了团结。日本工人阶级发挥了巨大的力量，一直站在前列，展开阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争。
    他并且指出，日本工人维护权利、反对“企业合理化”的斗争在今年也有了巨大的发展。
    太田指出，明年是决定日本民族命运的重要一年，对于打破战争体制，争取独立、民主、中立和提高生活水平的斗争是具有决定性意义的一年。他表示，总评议会决心站在前列，团结全体日本人民，为迫使垄断资本陷入孤立、粉碎“安全体系”的民族事业而斗争。
    全日本农民协会联合会会长野沟胜指出，今年日本农民组织完成了统一，工农合作有了具体的进展，这是在农民斗争中具有历史意义的事情。
    他强调指出农民开始参加反对修改“安全条约”斗争的重大意义。他说，这意味着农民正在通过参加斗争发挥它们巨大的活力。
    野沟表示，为了争取日本的完全独立，农民将进一步加强同工人阶级的合作。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁指出，团结在协议会周围的广大人民排除了反动派的政治压迫，已经站起来展开反对修改“安全条约”的斗争。这意味着，在即将到来的新的一年中，日本的和平运动向争取永远停止试验核武器和全面彻底裁军的方向再迈出一步的条件已经具备。
    安井表示，明年，协议会将进一步团结参加斗争的几千万人民，展开大规模运动，阻止修改“安全条约”和反对进行核武装，促使派兵出国参加战争的反动政策改变。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章指出，为了同帝国主义展开斗争，在明年争取恢复日中邦交的运动将占很重要的地位。
    风见章在谈到美帝国主义也不得不唱“和平”调子的时候说，我们要同“伪善”的和平运动和“反共”活动展开斗争，这是极为重要的。
    日中贸易促进会专务理事铃木一雄指出，今年，日本经济界通过协助石桥湛山和松村谦三访华以及召开厂商大会要求打开日中关系僵局等，展开了比前年更活跃的运动。这意味着打开日中关系僵局的要求已经深入和扩展到包括大厂商在内的整个经济界，并且开始发挥它的潜在力量。这种力量在明年一定能起更大的作用。
    铃木说，岸信介内阁目前只图苟延残喘坚持执政，而日本经济界对它的不满正在日益增大。
  经过一番坚持斗争，日本人民终于冲破岸政府的武装警察防线，进入国会向议员们表达他们反对美日新军事同盟的愿望。
