Ma Village Commune Members Gao Baoxian and Xu Guanqing Boldly Create and Repeatedly Experiment
Successfully Extracting Starch from Corn Husk
Henan Begins to Promote the Method in Various Regions; Liaoning Invites Xu Guanqing to Impart Experience

(Our dispatch) Corn husk can extract a large amount of starch. This was created by comrades Gao Baoxian and Xu Guanqing, workers at the Ma Village Commune Non-Staple Food Processing Factory in Qingfeng County, Henan Province.

The starch extracted from corn husk can be eaten by people and is also good feed for pigs and livestock. This kind of starch, mixed with 20% to 30% of miscellaneous grain flour or wheat flour, can make pancakes, steamed buns, dumplings, etc., that are almost indistinguishable from white flour; mixed with 30% of mung bean flour, it can also make noodles and delicious pastries. The residue left after the starch is extracted from the corn husk – the crude fiber – can be used for papermaking, rope making, etc.

According to the Henan Provincial Grain Department Scientific Research Institute, dry corn husk contains 33.36% starch; 3% protein; 0.64% fat; 1.62% sugar, and other ingredients. Therefore, extracting starch from corn husk is scientifically sound. Inspired by the Party's General Line, comrades Gao Baoxian and Xu Guanqing began researching the extraction of starch from corn husk as early as October of last year, failing twice in a row. At that time, people with conservative ideas ridiculed them as "toads wanting to eat swan meat, with lofty but unrealistic dreams." However, with the support and encouragement of the Party, they continued to work hard and finally succeeded in their experiment.

The specific method for extracting starch from corn husk is as follows: wash the corn husk and put it into a pot to boil. For every pound of corn husk, use one tael, two mace, and five li of baking soda (halve the amount when boiling the second pot) and boil for three to four hours, until it is cooked until it can be picked into shreds by hand as the standard, then take it out and stir it in a vat. After cooling, wash it like washing clothes, wash it three or four times, then remove the shreds, filter the washed slurry to remove impurities, and pour the slurry into clean water to rinse it twice, and the starch is made. After Qingfeng County promoted this method, from October 15th to November 5th, in twenty days, it had already extracted 936 jin of wet starch from corn husk. The Henan Provincial Party Committee attached great importance to this experience, believing that it has significant political and economic significance, and convened an on-site meeting in Qingfeng County to promote it throughout the province.

After this news spread, Liaoning Province also invited Xu Guanqing, one of the creators of this experience, to Shenyang to give an on-site demonstration of corn husk starch extraction. The grain departments of Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces also sent people to participate in this on-site demonstration meeting.

    从玉米穗包皮提取淀粉成功
    河南各地开始推广辽宁邀请徐冠卿前往传授经验
    本报讯　玉米穗包皮（以下简称玉米皮）可以提取大量淀粉。这是河南清丰县马村公社副食品加工厂工人高保先、徐冠卿同志创造的。
    从玉米皮中提取的淀粉，人可以吃，也是猪和牲畜的好饲料。这种淀粉掺入20％到30％的杂粮粉或小麦粉，可以做出和白面粉相差无几的烙饼、馒头、饺子等；掺入30％的绿豆面还可以做面条和可口的糕点。玉米皮提取淀粉后剩下的渣子——粗纤维，可作造纸、打绳等用。
    据河南省粮食厅科学研究所化验：干玉米皮含有淀粉33.36％；蛋白质3％；脂肪0.64％；糖1.62％及其他成分，因此从玉米皮中提取淀粉是合乎科学道理的。高保先、徐冠卿同志在党的总路线的鼓舞下，早在去年10月，就开始研究用玉米皮提取淀粉，先后两次都失败了。当时有保守思想的人，讽刺他们是“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉，心高妄想。”但是在党的支持和鼓舞下，他们继续刻苦研究，终于试验成功。
    从玉米皮中提取淀粉的具体方法是：将玉米穗包皮洗净后下锅煮，每斤玉米穗包皮用一两二钱五厘面碱（煮第二锅时减半）煮三至四小时，以煮烂用手挑成丝为标准，然后捞出在缸内搅拌，冷却后像洗衣服一样淘洗，洗过三、四遍后把丝子捞净，把洗好的浆水过筛子去掉杂质，再把浆水倒入清水冲洗两遍，淀粉就制成了。清丰县推广这办法后，从10月15日到11月5日二十天中，已从玉米皮中提取湿淀粉九百三十六斤。中共河南省委很重视这项经验，认为具有重大的政治意义和经济意义，并在清丰县召开了现场会议向全省推广。
    这消息传出后，辽宁省还邀请这项经验的创造者之一的徐冠卿同志，到沈阳作了玉米皮提取淀粉的现场表演，黑龙江、吉林两省粮食部门也派人参加了这次现场表演会。
