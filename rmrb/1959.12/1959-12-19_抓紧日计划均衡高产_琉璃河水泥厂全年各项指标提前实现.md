Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: The Liulihe Cement Plant in Beijing has been grasping daily plans at every level in the midst of a vigorous mass movement this year. As a result, it has achieved high quality and high production every month, and has completed the annual state plan ahead of schedule. The lives of the workers are also filled with both work and leisure, and are rich and colorful.

The plant's comprehensive completion of the annual plan is as follows: the total output value plan was completed 39 days ahead of schedule; the total output plan was completed 27 days ahead of schedule; the product quality was up to standard, achieving the requirement of increasing the factory's cement by half a grade; labor productivity increased by 12% compared to the quota; the cost per ton of cement decreased by 1.2% compared to last year; and the state-stipulated cement allocation plan was fully completed on schedule.

The Liulihe Cement Plant started the planning work early, did it in detail, ensured that everyone was clear about the numbers, and grasped the inspection tightly at every level. On the 28th of each month, the factory would convene cadres from each workshop to estimate the possible problems in the next month based on the annual plan and the production situation of the current month, and to set the plan for the next month's output, quality, cost, etc. Following this, each workshop would hold a meeting with technicians, team leaders, and veteran workers, and, in accordance with the tasks assigned by the factory, analyze the equipment, raw materials, fuel, and other conditions, study corresponding technical measures, and set the daily plan for the whole month. Before starting work each day, the duty team leader of each production workshop would mobilize the workers in the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, and then, based on the workshop's daily plan and the previous shift's completion of tasks, consciously formulate the team's daily plan, and also compile an hourly plan. All auxiliary departments of the factory also formulated their own plans. After the various plans were formulated, each level adopted different methods to promptly check the implementation. The factory level grasped the ten-day plan and checked it on a daily basis; the workshop grasped the daily plan and checked it on a shift basis; and each team grasped the plan and checked it on an hourly basis. When the factory's Party committee was formulating and inspecting the production plans at all levels, it constantly carried out education among the workers on comprehensively completing the plan.

As a result of grasping the daily plan tightly at every level, more than 80% of the working days this year have completed or exceeded the plan. At the same time, production can be carried out in a balanced way, achieving a balance between work and leisure.
