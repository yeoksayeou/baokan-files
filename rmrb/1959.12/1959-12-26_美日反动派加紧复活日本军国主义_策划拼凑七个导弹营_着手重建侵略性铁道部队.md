　　Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's government's "Defense Agency" spokesman recently announced that the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" will be equipped with "Nike-Ajax" surface-to-air missiles.

　　He said that the "Defense Agency" has decided to send more than 200 personnel selected from the "Ground Self-Defense Force" to the "Nike" missile training center at Bliss, Texas, USA, for two years of training in the summer of next year.

　　Japan's Second Expansion Plan (1960-1965) stipulates that four "Nike" missile battalions and three "Hawk" missile battalions will be established by 1965. Sources say that the Japanese "Defense Agency" has decided that the first battalion will be composed of personnel from the "Ground Self-Defense Force," and the other three battalions will be composed of personnel from the "Air Self-Defense Force." Sources said that the United States has agreed that when the first batch of personnel trained in the United States return to Japan, it will "lend" Japan "Nike" missiles and launching devices to equip a battalion free of charge.

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, Tokyo dispatch: According to a report in "Akahata" today, the Nobusuke Kishi government is starting to rebuild aggressive railway troops.

　　"Akahata" said that a recent investigation by the National Railway (Kokutetsu) Motive Power Union has revealed that the Japanese "Defense Agency" has dispatched a group of "Self-Defense Force" members to the railway training center for training. National Railway Corporation Director Yosunago Toyo admitted at a meeting of the Transportation Committee of the House of Councillors on December 10 that this was to establish railway troops in Chiba Prefecture. The union's investigation revealed that the Nobusuke Kishi government's plan to establish railway troops began as early as June of last year, and this unit will bear the task of invading foreign countries and suppressing railway workers.

　　"Akahata" pointed out that the past railway troops fully assisted the Japanese imperialist army during the war and assumed the important task of invading China. Chiba Prefecture, where the new railway troops are being established, also had a railway unit stationed there during the war. The "Defense Agency's" plan is nothing more than a revival of aggressive railway troops.

　　The "Kokutetsu" Motive Power Union has lodged a serious protest with the "Kokutetsu" authorities, demanding an immediate halt to the training of "Self-Defense Force" personnel. The union also called on the "Kokutetsu" union and the All-Japan Transportation Workers Union Council to launch a joint struggle to stop the "Kokutetsu" authorities from assisting in the training of railway troops.

    策划拼凑七个导弹营　着手重建侵略性铁道部队
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本岸信介政府“防卫厅”发言人最近宣布，日本“自卫队”将配备“奈克—阿贾克斯式”地对空导弹。
    他说，“防卫厅”已经决定在明年夏季派遣两百多名从“陆上自卫队”中挑选出来的人员到美国得克萨斯州勃立斯堡的“奈克”式导弹训练所受训两年。
    日本的第二个扩军计划（1960年—1965年）规定在1965年以前建立四个“奈克”式导弹营和三个“隼”式导弹营。有消息说，日本“防卫厅”决定由“陆上自卫队”人员组成第一营，其它三个营由“航空自卫队”的人员组成。消息说，美国已经同意，在美国受训的第一批人员回日本时，将无代价地把装备一个营的“奈克”式导弹和发射装置“借”给日本。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，岸信介政府正在着手重新建立侵略性的铁路部队。
    “赤旗报”说，国营铁道（“国铁”）动力车工会最近进行的调查判明，日本“防卫厅”已经派遣一批“自卫队”队员到铁道教练所受训。“国铁”公司理事吾孙子丰12月10日在参议院运输委员会会议上承认，这是为了在千叶县建立铁道部队。工会的调查揭露，岸信介政府成立铁道部队的计划早在去年6月间就开始实施，这个部队将肩负侵略外国和镇压铁道工人的任务。
    “赤旗报”指出，过去的铁道部队在战争时期曾经全面协助日本帝国主义军队，担当了侵略中国的重要任务。目前在那里成立新的铁道部队的千叶县，在战争时也曾经驻有一支铁道部队。“防卫厅”的这项计划不外是复活侵略性铁道部队。
    “国铁”动力车工会已经对“国铁”当局提出严重抗议，要求立即停止训练“自卫队”人员。工会还呼吁“国铁”工会和全日本交通运输工会协议会展开共同斗争，以便制止“国铁”当局协助训练铁道部队。
