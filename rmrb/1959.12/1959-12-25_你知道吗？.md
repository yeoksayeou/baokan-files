　　Did you know?
　　There is a sea on Earth that glows whenever the water moves. When ships pass through it at night, it looks like they are sailing through a sea of fire, with the waves they create resembling countless flying sparks.
　　You don't need to worry about the ship catching fire, because there is no fire, and even the temperature of the sea is no higher than elsewhere. This glowing phenomenon is caused by tiny creatures called Noctiluca scintillans. Like fireflies, they can emit light, but they are much smaller. A single drop of seawater can contain hundreds of them, which creates the amazing phenomenon described above.
　　　　　　　　　　＊
　　We often consider deserts to be "barren lands," but in fact, many organisms still grow tenaciously in the desert.
　　The "saxaul" is one such tree. Although there is little rain in the desert and evaporation is rapid, saxaul seeds can germinate in just two or three hours if there is water. After rainfall, it sprouts before the moisture has even evaporated.
　　The saxaul also has very long roots, longer than its stem, which allows it to absorb water from deep underground and withstand the attacks of desert storms.

　　你知道吗？
    地球上有这样一种海，只要海水一动就会发光，因此当船只在黑夜里经过这里的时候，就像在火海中航行一样，激起的浪花仿佛千万颗火星飞舞。
    你不用担心船只会被烧着，这里没有火，甚至连海水的温度也并不比别处高，这种发光现象是一种微小的生物夜光虫造成的，它和萤火虫一样能够发光，但比萤火虫要小得多，一滴海水中就可以含几百个，而这时就造成了上面那种奇妙的现象。

    我们常把沙漠当作“不毛之地”，其实沙漠里仍然有不少生物在顽强地生长着。
    “梭梭”就是其中的一种树木，尽管沙漠中雨水少、蒸发又快，但是梭梭的种子只要有水，两三小时就能发芽，降雨后水分还来不及蒸发干它便已经发出芽来了。
    梭梭还有很长的根，比茎还要长，这使它能吸收地下深处的水分并且不怕沙漠中风暴的袭击。
