Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 16th. The Ge Bao water conservancy project, jointly built by the people on the Sino-Vietnamese border, officially opened its gates on the 12th to release water.

More than 12,000 local representatives and border residents from China and Vietnam participated in the water release ceremony and held a get-together.

On the morning of the 12th, Chinese local representatives and representatives of border residents went to the second aqueduct within the territory of Chongqing County, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to participate in the water conservancy project completion and water release ceremony hosted by the Vietnamese side. At 10:30 a.m., the water release ceremony began. Fang Jincheng, member of the Standing Committee of the Chongqing County Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, and Huang Xiaolin, First Secretary of the Jingxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting successively. After Comrade Fang Jincheng cut the ribbon, the surging river water sprayed out from the sluice gate and flowed straight down along the wide canal. At this time, applause and cheers rang out. At 7:30 p.m. that day, the representatives of both sides went together to Yuexu Town, Jingxi County, Guangxi, to hold a get-together. The get-together lasted for three days. At the get-together on the morning of the 13th, Huo Junfeng, head of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region delegation of China, and Hongqi, head of the Cao Bang Province People's Delegation of the Vietnam-Bac Autonomous Region, spoke successively, jointly congratulating the successful completion of this water conservancy project, which symbolizes the friendship between the people of China and Vietnam.

The Ge Bao water conservancy project was jointly constructed by the local governments of Jingxi County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China and Chongqing County in Cao Bang Province of Vietnam, according to the needs of the people on the border between the two countries. The project consists of 131 items, including flood discharge channels and irrigation canals in the Vietnamese irrigation area, with a total length of 17.01 kilometers; three stone mountain tunnels with a total length of 666 meters; two reinforced concrete aqueducts with a total length of 134.4 meters; as well as flood discharge gates, water intake gates, diversion gates, culverts, bridges, etc. The entire project used more than 778,000 workdays.

The Po Dou River, which flows from Jingxi in China to Vietnam, is blocked by the Ku Pang and Long Neng mountains across the Sino-Vietnamese border. For many years, more than 20,000 mu of land in the Yuexu and Dizhou communes of Jingxi County have been flooded frequently because the river water cannot be discharged; while the 2,700 mu of paddy fields in the Feng Nham and Ngoc Khe agricultural cooperatives of Chongqing County, Vietnam, have suffered from drought and reduced production due to the lack of water separated by the mountains. After the completion of the Ge Bao water conservancy project, not only can the flooded land in the Yuexu Commune of Jingxi County be protected from flood threats, but also more than 14,000 mu of arable land can be expanded. The water use problem of the drought-stricken paddy fields of the two agricultural cooperatives in Chongqing County, Vietnam, has also been completely solved, and the paddy fields can be transformed from one crop to two crops.

The border people of China and Vietnam, who have a tradition of unity and cooperation, fought side by side and supported each other in the construction of this water conservancy project. The Vietnamese side sent the Deputy Secretary of the Chongqing County Committee to lead a group of staff and a large number of migrant workers to participate in the project construction. When the Chinese side did not have enough cement, the Vietnamese side immediately transferred 1,000 tons of high-grade cement from Hanoi. Chinese migrant workers launched a "race against time" competition to cooperate with the construction of the Vietnamese irrigation canal system project. The migrant workers of the Xinxing Brigade, who were responsible for the backfilling project of the Zhu Long horizontal culvert, stayed on the construction site for three days and three nights, each carrying 150 jin of soil each time. Therefore, this project, which started in December 1958, was completed by the end of November this year, half the time ahead of the original plan.

    中越两国边境人民团结协作的结晶
    个宝水利工程举行放水典礼
    新华社南宁16日电　中越两国边境人民共同兴建的个宝水利工程，在12日正式开闸放水。
    中越两国地方代表和边境居民一万二千多人参加了放水典礼，并且举行了联欢。
    12日早晨，中国地方代表及边境居民代表，前往越南民主共和国重庆县境内第二渡槽参加越南方面主持的水利工程完工放水典礼。上午十时三十分，放水典礼开始，越南劳动党重庆县委常委方进成和中国共产党靖西县委第一书记黄小林，先后在会上讲话。方进成同志剪彩以后，汹涌的河水从水闸喷射而出，沿着宽阔的水渠直泻而下。这时，鼓掌声、欢呼声响成一片。当天下午七时半，双方代表又一同到广西靖西县岳圩镇举行联欢大会。联欢大会连续举行了三天。在13日早晨的联欢大会上，我国广西僮族自治区代表团团长霍俊峰和越南越北自治区高平省人民代表团团长红旗先后讲了话，共同祝贺这个象征中越两国人民友谊的水利工程胜利建成。
    个宝水利工程，是中国广西僮族自治区靖西县同越南高平省重庆县双方地方政府根据两国边境人民的需要共同修建的。工程共有一百三十一项，其中包括排洪渠和越南灌区渠道，共长十七点零一公里；三座石山隧洞，共长六百六十六米；两座钢筋混凝土渡槽，共长一百三十四点四米；以及泄洪闸、进水闸、分水闸、涵洞、桥梁等。全部工程用了七十七万八千多个工日。
    由中国靖西流向越南的坡豆河，被横在中越边境上的枯庞、陇能两座大山截阻，多少年来靖西县岳圩、地州两个公社由于河水无法流泄，经常有两万多亩土地遭受水淹；而越南重庆县的丰淰、玉溪两个农业合作社的两千七百多亩稻田，却因为隔山少水一直受旱减产。个宝水利工程完工后，靖西县岳圩公社不仅受淹的土地可以免受洪水威胁，同时还能扩大耕地一万四千多亩。越南重庆县两个农业社受旱稻田的用水问题，也全部得到解决，可以把稻田由一造变为两造。
    有着团结协作传统的中越两国边境人民，在修建这个水利工程中，并肩奋战，互相支援。越南方面派重庆县委副书记带领一批工作人员及大批民工参加工程建设，当中国方面水泥不够用时，越南方面立即从河内调来一千吨高标号水泥。中国民工为配合越南灌溉渠系工程的施工，掀起了“与时间赛跑”的竞赛热潮。负责祝龙横涵洞填土工程的新兴大队的民工，三天三夜不离工地，每人每次挑土达一百五十斤。因此，这个在1958年12月动工的工程，比原订计划提前了一半时间，在今年11月底就完工了。
