    印度尼西亚核心内阁
    就紧急状态法作出决定
    新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚核心内阁在8日晚上的会议上作出了关于紧急状态法的决定。据印度尼西亚情报部副部长马拉迪今天宣布，苏加诺总统完全赞同内阁的决定。这项决定将加以实施而不先提交国会。
    马拉迪在内阁会议后曾指出，内阁的决定是有关延长紧急状态问题的。马拉迪还说，内阁的决定是以总统在临时最高谘询委员会11月举行的会议上作出的这样一个决定为依据的：即如果紧急状态法要延长的话，也将考虑“逐步废除”这一法令的安排。马拉迪指出，还没有就形成和实行这种“逐步废除”问题作出任何决定。据宣布，内阁关于紧急状态法的决定至迟将在12月16日公布。目前的紧急状态法将在12月17日满期。
