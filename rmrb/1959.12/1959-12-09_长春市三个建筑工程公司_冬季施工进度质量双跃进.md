Changchun, December 8th (This newspaper) -- Workers from the First, Second, and Third Construction Engineering Companies under the Changchun City Construction Engineering Bureau are battling the severe cold and conscientiously adopting cold-proof and heat-preservation measures to ensure the smooth winter construction of eighty-nine key projects throughout the city.

The winter construction tasks of the three companies under the Changchun City Construction Engineering Bureau this year greatly exceed those of previous years. They must complete 22.4% of the annual plan in November and December. As early as before the start of winter, the three companies separately selected and trained more than forty temperature measurement personnel and supplied insulation materials such as sawdust, sorghum stalks, calcium chloride, and antifreeze agents. After the start of winter, the temperature measurement personnel at each construction site promptly and accurately measured and recorded the temperature in accordance with the technical requirements of winter construction, strictly controlling project quality. At the same time, each construction site used different insulation materials for cold-proof and heat-preservation according to different winter construction methods to prevent freezing accidents.

On the basis of cold-proof and heat-preservation, many construction sites organized rapid construction. In November and December, the three companies plan to rapidly construct nearly 20,000 square meters of building area. Due to the implementation of rapid construction, some projects have been completed ahead of schedule, and some projects are being accelerated. In general, the construction progress has been accelerated by more than 60%, and there have been very few project quality accidents, which is much lower than in previous years, achieving a double leap in construction progress and project quality in winter.

    长春市三个建筑工程公司
    冬季施工进度质量双跃进
    本报长春8日电　长春市建筑工程局所属一、二、三公司职工与严寒搏斗，认真采取防寒保温措施，保证了全市八十九项重点工程顺利进行冬季施工。
    长春市建筑工程局所属三个公司今年冬季的施工任务大大超过往年，在11和12两个月内要完成全年计划的22.4％。早在入冬前，三个公司就分别抽调和集训了四十多个测温人员，供应了锯末、秫秸、氯化钙等保温材料和防冻剂。入冬后，各工地的测温人员按照冬季施工的技术要求，及时准确地测量和记录温度，严格控制工程质量。同时，各工地根据不同的冬季施工方法，使用不同的保温材料进行防寒保温，防止发生冻寒事故。
    在防寒保温的基础上，许多工地组织了快速施工。在11月和12月内，三个公司计划快速施工的建筑工程面积将近二万平方米。由于推行了快速施工，目前已有部分工程提前建成，部分工程正在加速建成，一般都加快建设进度60％以上，而且工程质量事故极少，大大低于往年，在冬季做到了施工进度和工程质量双跃进。
