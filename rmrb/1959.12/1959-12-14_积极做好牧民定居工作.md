Actively Do a Good Job in Settling Herdsmen
By Our Own Commentator

In the vast pastoral areas of our country, due to various historical reasons, the vast number of herdsmen have always lived a nomadic life. This kind of life is not conducive to animal husbandry production, nor is it conducive to the health of the herdsmen, and it is even more impossible to carry out basic construction in the pastoral areas. Only by changing this situation, gradually establishing settlements, and helping the herdsmen to settle down will it accelerate the socialist construction of the pastoral areas and greatly develop the productive forces of the vast pastoral areas.

Since liberation, the Party and the state have always attached great importance to changing the nomadic economy. As early as 1953, the Third (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, in its "Basic Summary of Animal Husbandry Production in Several Pastoral Areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan, Qinghai, Xinjiang and Other Places," determined the policy of advocating settled nomadism. The symposium on animal husbandry production in pastoral areas jointly convened by the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the State Council, and the Ministry of Agriculture on November 25, 1957, also discussed and studied this issue. The symposium pointed out that in nomadic areas, settlements should be established first to facilitate socialist transformation and socialist construction.

With the vigorous help of the Party and the state, especially in the people's commune movement, and through the efforts of the vast number of herdsmen, our country's pastoral areas have achieved great success in promoting settled nomadism. Up to now, more than two million minority ethnic herdsmen across the country have basically ended their nomadic life for thousands of years and achieved settled nomadism. All people's communes on the Inner Mongolia grasslands are further making comprehensive plans for settlement based on production conditions, and are actively establishing settlements. There are already about 2,000 settlements in the people's communes of Xinjiang's pastoral areas. Settlements for herdsmen in Qinghai Province have spread all over the grasslands, and bustling villages and towns have appeared in many places. 70% of the more than 200,000 minority ethnic herdsmen in Gansu Province have settled down.

After the vast number of herdsmen established people's communes and settled down, they strengthened the feeding and management of livestock, developed diversified economies, and the herdsmen's labor conditions, production technology, and living habits have also changed. For example, this year, people's communes in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia planted 1.4 million mu of grain and feed, and many banners and counties have gone from being short of grain to being self-sufficient and having a surplus. Zhaosu County in Xinjiang used to rely on external supplies of rations last year, but this year the county's grain production increased by more than 58%, achieving self-sufficiency and a surplus. While vigorously developing agriculture, pastoral industries have also sprung up. The Xilin Gol League grassland in Inner Mongolia, a purely nomadic area, had no industry at all in the past. Now, thousands of small dairy processing plants, as well as many small hydropower stations, fur processing plants, and agricultural and pastoral machinery plants, have been built in the settlements. Many industries have also been established in pastoral areas such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu. Wherever settlements have been established, various cultural, educational, and health facilities have been established, and the cultural life of the vast number of herdsmen has begun to improve.

The implementation of settlements in pastoral areas is a new task, and there is not much experience yet. Therefore, the Party committees and governments at all levels attach great importance to summarizing experience in this regard. According to the experience of various places in the past few years, in promoting settlement work, we should first pay attention to strengthening propaganda and education among the herdsmen, so that the herdsmen can gradually settle down in a planned way under the principle of being conscious and voluntary; secondly, we should pay attention to selecting and determining the settlements, so that after the herdsmen settle down, they will have better grasslands and water sources for grazing, living and basic construction; thirdly, we must help the herdsmen solve various difficulties before and after settlement, such as the herdsmen being unfamiliar with agricultural production technology and lacking agricultural tools and materials for building houses. Therefore, we should help the herdsmen learn the techniques of managing agriculture, building houses, etc., and help solve material difficulties as much as possible; at the same time, we should determine the form and content of settlement according to the specific situation and actual possibilities at that time and place. If conditions permit and without affecting the management of animal husbandry, we can settle down completely, gradually carry out the basic construction of the settlement, develop diversified economies, and run various cultural and welfare undertakings; if it is difficult to implement complete settlement, we can temporarily implement seasonal settlement and gradually transition to the form of complete settlement. The construction of settlements can be done according to one's ability. Complete settlement is of course good, but semi-settlement can also combine settlement with nomadism to overcome the shortcomings of pure nomadism. Therefore, both of these forms of settlement should be valued.

In the past few years, the work of promoting settled nomadism in pastoral areas has achieved great success, and has therefore played a significant role in promoting animal husbandry production and changing the nomadic economy. However, at present, there are still some areas, such as the pastoral areas of Sichuan and Tibet, that have not yet implemented settlement and are still in a nomadic state; in some areas that have implemented settlement, production has not yet been fully developed, and the construction of settlements has only just begun. It will take a long time to solve these problems. Therefore, continuing to do a good job in settling herdsmen is still an important task in pastoral areas. Especially after the realization of the people's commune system, it is more conducive to promoting this work, and doing a good job in settlement will also help consolidate the people's commune. At present, the conditions for doing a good job in settling herdsmen are better than ever before. As long as we pay attention to it, this work will surely proceed smoothly and achieve greater success.

    积极做好牧民定居工作
    本报评论员
    在我国辽阔的牧业区里，由于历史上的种种原因，广大牧民一直过着游牧生活。这种生活，既不利于畜牧业生产，也不利于牧民的健康，更无法进行牧业区的基本建设。只有改变这种状况，逐步地建立定居点，帮助牧民定居下来，才会加速进行牧业区的社会主义建设，大大发展广大牧区的生产力。
    解放以来，党和国家一直非常重视游牧经济的改变。早在1953年，中央民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议上关于“内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地若干牧业区畜牧业生产的基本总结”中，就确定了提倡定居游牧的政策。1957年11月25日中共中央农村工作部、国务院民族事务委员会和农业部联合召开的牧区畜牧业生产座谈会上，也讨论和研究了这个问题。这次座谈会上指出：凡是游牧的地区，应当首先定居下来，以利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设。
    在党和国家的大力帮助下，特别是在人民公社化运动中，经过广大牧民的努力，我国牧业区推行定居游牧的工作已取得了巨大成就。到目前为止，全国已有二百多万少数民族牧民，基本上结束了千百年来的游牧生活，实现定居游牧。内蒙古草原上所有的人民公社，都在根据生产情况进一步作出定居的全面规划，积极地建立定居地。新疆牧区人民公社的定居点，已达两千个左右。青海省牧民的定居点已遍布草原，不少地方出现了热闹的村镇。甘肃省二十多万少数民族牧民有70％定居下来。
    广大牧民成立了人民公社和定居以后，对于牲畜的饲养管理加强了，多种经济发展了，牧民的劳动条件、生产技术以及生活习惯等方面也都发生了变化。例如内蒙古牧区各人民公社今年种植了一百四十万亩粮食和饲料，许多旗、县由粮食不足达到粮食自给有余。新疆昭苏县去年还依靠外地供应口粮，而今年全县增产粮食58％以上，自给有余。在大搞农业的同时，牧区工业也兴办起来了。内蒙古的纯游牧区锡林郭勒草原，过去根本没有工业，现在在定居点上兴建了成千座小型乳品加工厂，还有许多小型水力发电站、皮毛加工厂、农牧机具厂等。新疆、青海、甘肃等牧区，也建立了很多工业。凡是定居的地方，都建立了各种文教卫生设施，开始改善了广大牧民的文化生活。
    牧区实行定居，是一件新的工作，经验还不多。因此，各地党委和政府非常重视这方面经验的总结。根据以往几年来各地的经验，在推行定居工作中，首先应该注意加强对牧民的宣传教育，使牧民在自觉自愿的原则下，有计划地逐步定居下来；其次要注意选择和确定定居点，使牧民定居后，有较好的草牧场和水源，以便放牧、居住和基本建设；再次，要帮助牧民解决定居前后的各种困难，例如牧民对农业生产技术不熟练，缺乏农业工具和建筑房屋的材料等。因此，就应帮助牧民学会经营农业、建筑房屋等方面的技术，并尽可能帮助解决物质上的困难；同时，要根据当时当地的具体情况和实际可能确定定居的形式和内容。条件许可并在不影响经营畜牧业的条件下，可以完全定居下来，逐步进行定居点的基本建设，发展多种经济，举办各项文化福利事业；如果实行完全定居有困难，也可以暂时实行季节性的定居，逐步再向完全定居的形式过渡。定居点的建设可以量力而行。完全定居当然好，但半定居也可以做到定居与游牧相结合，克服纯游牧的缺点。因此，这两种定居形式都应当被重视。
    几年来，牧业区推行定居游牧的工作，已获得了巨大成就，因而，对促进畜牧业生产、改变游牧经济起了重大的作用。但是，目前还有一部分地区例如四川和西藏牧区还没有实行定居，仍然处在游牧状态中；有些已实行定居的地区，生产还没有全面发展，定居点的各项建设才刚刚开始，要解决这些问题还需要一个较长的时间。因而，继续做好牧民的定居工作，仍然是当前牧区的一项重要任务。特别在实现人民公社化之后，更有利于推行这项工作，而做好定居工作，也有助于人民公社的巩固。目前，做好牧民定居工作的条件，比以往任何时候都好，只要重视起来，这项工作一定能够顺利的进行，并取得更大的成就。
