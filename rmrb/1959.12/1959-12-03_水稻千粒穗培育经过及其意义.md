The Cultivation Process and Significance of High-Yielding Rice with Thousands of Grains per Panicle
Assistant Teacher of Agronomy Department, South China Agricultural College, Lu Yonggen

In order to achieve a continued leap forward in agricultural production, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed last year that "thousands of grains per panicle and ten thousand grains per kilogram" should be the goal for rice variety breeding work. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of South China Agricultural College, Comrade Yang Minghan was determined to cultivate high-yielding rice with thousands of grains per panicle (Editor's note: Yang Minghan was originally a young farmer from Luoding County, Guangdong, a member of the Communist Youth League, and is 23 years old this year). He began experiments on distant hybridization of rice breeding based on the Michurin theory in 1952. Because of his achievements in research, he was awarded the honorary titles of Outstanding Communist Youth League Member of Guangdong Province and National Agricultural Technology Innovator in 1954. In order to train him, the Party sent him to study at South China Agricultural College in 1956. Recently, many plants with thousands of grains per panicle have appeared in his experimental field. Among them, one plant had 23 panicles, with an average of 1,228 grains per panicle; the largest panicle of another plant reached 1,745 grains. So far, the cultivation of high-yielding rice with thousands of grains per panicle has achieved preliminary results.

Cultivation Process

When Yang Minghan started the selection of high-yielding rice with thousands of grains per panicle this year, he selected seeds from large-panicle plants of the fourth generation of "Xinfan Guibai" hybrid seeds as materials, numbering a panicle with 915 grains as "Xinfan Guibai" No. 48, a panicle with 878 grains as "Xinfan Guibai" No. 40, and a panicle with 823 grains as "Xinfan Guibai" No. 16.

The origin of "Xinfan Guibai" is as follows: In 1952, Yang Minghan used the late-season farmer variety "Xinyi Bai" as the female parent and "Fanluo Bai" for hybridization, resulting in the "Xinfan" hybrid. In 1954, Yang Minghan again used the second generation of "Xinfan" hybrid as the female parent and Guizhou barnyard grass for hybridization, resulting in "Xinfan Guibai." In the process of hybridization between rice and barnyard grass, Yang Minghan adopted the method of staggered sowing to adjust the heading period of rice and barnyard grass, sowing one batch every five days for a total of three batches. As a result, the two parents of the second batch headed at the same time. Barnyard grass usually blooms at 5:00 a.m., while the initial flowering period of rice every day is after 8:00 a.m. In order to delay the flowering period of barnyard grass, measures were taken to shorten the light exposure during the heading period of barnyard grass. A total of 2,466 florets were pollinated, and 12 grains were set, with a seed setting rate of 0.48%. Only five of the twelve seeds germinated, and one of the plants produced variation.

The hybrid offspring of "Xinfan Guibai" did not show segregation from the first to the third generation, but some traits of the plants were inclined to the male parent, such as thick and hard stems and extremely high grain density. A large amount of segregation occurred in the fourth generation. Under the cultivation conditions of single-plant planting with a spacing of 6x7 inches in ordinary fields, large-panicle plants with single panicles of 915 grains, 878 grains, and 823 grains appeared.

This year, Yang Minghan planted the fifth generation of "Xinfan Guibai" in ordinary paddy fields, with planting specifications of 10x8 inches and 6x3 inches for single-plant planting. Throughout the entire cultivation process, especially after the young panicle formation stage, the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer was increased to 1:1:2. Debudding treatment was carried out on individual plants, and all tillers were removed throughout the entire growth process of the rice plant, leaving only the main stem, so that the nutrients of the whole plant were concentrated on the growth of the main stem, making the rice panicle larger and increasing the number of florets.

Cultivation Results

In Yang Minghan's experimental field, all rice plants that had undergone debudding treatment achieved thousands of grains per panicle. Among them, the main panicle of "Xinfan Guibai" No. 48 reached 1,745 grains after debudding treatment.

More importantly, under the cultivation conditions of single-plant planting with a spacing of 10x8 inches in ordinary fields, without any treatment such as debudding, in the "Xinfan Guibai" No. 40 system, one plant had a total of 23 panicles, each panicle reaching more than 1,118 grains, with the largest panicle reaching 1,475 grains, averaging 1,228 grains per panicle. In the "Xinfan Guibai" No. 48 system, the main panicles of five plants were all above 1,000 grains, and the average number of grains in the main and tiller panicles of another two plants were all above 1,000 grains. In addition, under the specification of 6x3 inches, in the "Xinfan Guibai" No. 16 system, the average number of grains per panicle in the main and tiller panicles of three plants were all above 1,000 grains.

Scientific Basis of Cultivation

Comrade Yang Minghan's entire work was carried out under the brilliant guidance of Michurin's theory, and the basic principles of Michurin's genetics on hybrid breeding are the basis for all measures.

First, the selection of hybrid parents. Michurin's genetics tells us that the heredity of hybrid offspring is unstable, and it is easier to achieve success when using hybrids as parents in distant hybridization. The selection of the second generation of "Xinfan" hybrid as the female parent is based on this principle. Because this material is the offspring of inter-varietal hybrids, the conservatism of heredity may have been eliminated, and the plasticity is large, so it is easier to mate successfully with the more distantly related barnyard grass.

Second, the issue of directional cultivation and selection. Michurin's genetics tells us that hybridization is only the beginning of the work of breeding new varieties, and the most important work should be placed on directional cultivation and selection. Because the hybrid offspring of "Xinfan Guibai" have been selected in the direction of large panicles and many grains for many years, combined with meticulous cultivation, the number of grains per panicle has obviously increased year by year: 580 grains appeared in the first generation of "Xinfan Guibai" (1955), 755 grains appeared in the second generation (1956), 823 grains appeared in the third generation (1957), 915 grains appeared in the fourth generation (1958), and 1,475 grains appeared in the fifth generation (1959, excluding debudding treatments). It can be seen that the excellent economic traits of hybrid offspring are gradually formed and consolidated.

Here, it should be pointed out that the preliminary success in cultivating high-yielding rice with thousands of grains per panicle is itself a scientific basis, because it is in line with objective laws. All scientific principles are summarized from practice.

Significance of Cultivation Success

The preliminary success in cultivating high-yielding rice with thousands of grains per panicle has great significance in biological science theory. It further proves the bankruptcy of Mendel's and Morgan's genetics. According to the views of Mendel's and Morgan's genetics, due to the different number and characteristics of chromosomes in distant plants, the mating of distant plants is difficult to succeed. Even if mating is successful occasionally, the offspring are infertile. In order to overcome the infertility of distant hybrid offspring, the method of polyploidy must be adopted, that is, the method of inducing changes with colchicine. In addition, Mendel's and Morgan's genetics believe that each trait of an organism is dominated by particles (genes) on chromosomes, and recessive traits and dominant traits are absolute. Therefore, the first generation must not segregate, and the second generation must segregate. They regard the meiotic division of chromosomes as the mechanism of segregation of hybrid offspring. The fact that the fifth generation of "Xinfan Guibai" appeared with 23 panicles, each panicle with more than 1,000 grains, under ordinary field cultivation conditions, and that the hybrid offspring did not undergo colchicine-induced changes or other treatments, but only due to directional cultivation and selection, but the seed setting rate has been continuously improved, and because the hybrid offspring of "Xinfan Guibai" do not segregate from the first to the third generation, and only show crazy segregation in the fourth generation, not only sexual segregation occurs, but also asexual segregation occurs at the same time. Some plants have main panicles like rice and tiller panicles like barnyard grass, while others are the opposite, with main panicles like barnyard grass and tiller panicles like rice. A large number of high-yielding rice with thousands of grains per panicle appeared in the fifth generation, and there were many other rice panicles with more than 600 grains. These undeniable facts all prove the fallacy of Mendel's and Morgan's chromosome genetics theory. The appearance of "Xinfan Guibai" with thousands of grains per panicle once again proves the correctness of Michurin's genetics.

The preliminary success in cultivating high-yielding rice with thousands of grains per panicle also has very important significance in production practice. The yield of rice depends on the number of panicles, the number of grains, and the weight of grains per unit area. The increase in the number of panicles per unit area has a certain limit, although the potential for increasing the number of panicles is still very large. When the number of panicles is increased to the maximum, further increasing the yield depends on the number of grains and the weight of grains. The potential of the number of grains is very large, because it can develop in space. The appearance of high-yielding rice with thousands of grains per panicle opens up a broad path for selecting high-yielding rice varieties.

The preliminary cultivation of high-yielding rice with thousands of grains per panicle has been successful, but a lot of work is still needed to make it applicable to field production. Such as more planned systematic selection, further improving the seed setting rate and fullness, as well as improving the grain weight on the basis of the number of grains, all need further research.

    水稻千粒穗培育经过及其意义
    华南农学院农学系助教　卢永根
    为了实现农业生产的继续跃进，中共广东省委在去年提出“千粒穗、万粒斤”作为水稻品种选育工作的奋斗目标。在中共华南农学院党委的领导下，杨明汉同志立下培育千粒穗的决心（编者注：杨明汉原是广东罗定县的青年农民，今年二十三岁，共青团员）。他从1952年开始根据米丘林学说进行水稻远缘杂交育种的试验，因为研究工作有成绩，1954年获得广东省优秀共青团员和全国农业技术革新者的光荣称号。党为了培养他，1956年送他到华南农学院学习。最近在他的试验田中出现了很多千粒穗的植株，其中有一植株达二十三穗，每穗平均一千二百二十八粒；另一植株最大的穗竟达一千七百四十五粒。至此，千粒穗的培育已获得初步成果。
    培育经过
    今年杨明汉开始千粒穗选育工作时，选择“信饭贵稗”杂种子四代的大穗植株的种子作为材料，将九百十五粒的一个穗编号为“信饭贵稗”48号，八百七十八粒的一穗编号为“信饭贵稗”40号，八百二十三粒的一穗编号为“信饭贵稗”16号。
      “信饭贵稗”的来源是这样：1952年杨明汉以晚季农家品种“信宜白”作母本和“饭罗白”进行杂交，得到“信饭”杂种。1954年杨明汉再以“信饭”杂种第二代作母本和贵州稗草杂交，得到“信饭贵稗”。在水稻和稗草的杂交过程中，杨明汉为了调节水稻和稗草的抽穗期，采用分期播种的方法，分别每隔五天播种一期，共播三期，结果第二期的两个亲本同时抽穗。稗草通常在清晨五时即开花，而水稻每日的始花期却在上午八时以后，为了延迟稗草的开花期，在抽穗期间对稗草采取缩短光照的办法。授粉颖花数共二千四百六十六朵，结实十二粒，结实率0.48％。十二粒种子仅五粒发芽，植株产生变异的一粒。
  “信饭贵稗”的杂种后代由子一代至子三代都没有发生分离现象，但植株的某些性状是倾向父本的，例如茎秆粗硬，着粒密度特高，至子四代才发生大量的分离。在普通大田六乘七寸规格单株植的栽培条件下，出现了单穗分别为九百十五粒、八百七十八粒和八百二十三粒的大穗的植株。
    杨明汉今年将“信饭贵稗”子五代栽种在普通的稻田上，插植规格采用十乘八寸和六乘三寸单株植。在整个栽培过程中，特别是在幼穗形成期以后，增施氮磷钾肥的比例为一比一比二。在个别植株中曾进行去蘖处理，在稻株整个生长过程中将分蘖全都除去，只保留主茎，使全株养分集中到主茎生长，使稻穗增大，颖花数增多。
    培育结果
    杨明汉的试验田里，凡经去蘖处理的稻株，全部都获致每穗千粒。其中“信饭贵稗”48号有一植株去蘖处理后，主穗竟达一千七百四十五粒。
    更加值得重视的是：在未经去蘖等任何处理，在普通大田十乘八寸规格单株植的栽培条件下，在“信饭贵稗”40号的系统中，有一植株共二十三穗，每穗都达一千一百十八粒以上，最大的穗达一千四百七十五粒，每穗平均一千二百二十八粒。在“信饭贵稗”48号的系统中，有五株的主穗都在千粒以上，另外有二株，其主穗和蘖穗的平均粒数都在千粒以上。此外，在六乘三寸的规格下，“信饭贵稗”16号系统中，有三株其主穗和蘖穗平均穗在千粒以上。
    培育的科学根据
    杨明汉同志的整个工作是在米丘林学说的光辉照耀下进行的，米丘林遗传学关于杂交育种的基本原理是各项措施的根据。
    第一，杂交亲本的选择问题。米丘林遗传学告诉我们，杂种后代的遗传性是动摇的，在远缘杂交时采用杂种作亲本将更易获致成功。选择“信饭”杂种子二代作母本就是基于这个原理，由于这个材料是品种间杂种的后代，遗传性的保守性可能已被消除，可塑性很大，因而较易与亲缘较远的稗草交配成功。
    第二，定向培育和选择问题。米丘林遗传学告诉我们，杂交仅是培育新品种工作的开始，最主要的工作应放在定向培育和选择上面。“信饭贵稗”杂种后代由于连年朝着穗大粒多的方向进行选择，再结合精细的栽培，因此穗粒明显地逐年增加：“信饭贵稗”子一代出现五百八十粒（1955年），子二代出现七百五十五粒（1956年），子三代出现八百二十三粒（1957年），子四代出现九百十五粒（1958年），子五代竟出现一千四百七十五粒（1959年，去蘖处理的不包括在内），可见杂种后代的优良经济性状是逐步形成和巩固的。
    在这里，应当指出：千粒穗初步培育成功，这事实本身就是科学根据，因为它是符合客观规律的。一切科学原理都是从实践中概括出来的。
    培育成功的意义
    千粒穗的初步培育成功在生物科学理论上具有重大的意义，它进一步证明了孟德尔、莫尔根遗传学的破产。按照孟德尔、莫尔根遗传学的观点看来，由于远缘植物的染色体数目和特性不同，远缘植物的交配是很难成功的，即使偶一交配成功，其后代也是不孕的，为了克服远缘杂种后代的不孕性，必须采用多倍体的办法，即通常采用秋水仙咸引变的办法。另外，孟德尔、莫尔根遗传学认为，有机体的每一个性状都是由染色体上的微粒（基因）所主宰的，隐性性状和显性性状是绝对的，因此子一代一定不分离，子二代必然要分离，他们把染色体的减数分裂看成是杂种后代分离的机制。而“信饭贵稗”的子五代在普通大田栽培情况下，出现一株二十三穗、穗穗千粒以上的事实，杂种后代并没有经过秋水仙咸引变或其它的处理，仅由于定向培育和选择，但结实率却得到不断的提高，又由于“信饭贵稗”的杂种后代由子一代到子三代都不发生分离，到子四代才出现疯狂的分离，不单出现有性分离，而且还同时出现无性分离，一些植株的主穗像水稻，分蘖穗像稗草，另一些植株则相反，主穗像稗草，分蘖穗像水稻，在子五代却出现了较大数量的千粒穗，其它在六百粒以上的稻穗是不少的。这些无可争辩的事实都证明，孟德尔、莫尔根染色体遗传学理论的谬误。“信饭贵稗”千粒穗的出现，再一次证明了米丘林遗传学的正确。
    千粒穗的初步培育成功，在生产实践上也具有十分重大的意义。水稻产量的构成取决于穗数、粒数和粒重，单位面积内穗数的提高是有一定的限度的，虽然目前提高穗数的潜力仍是很大的。当穗数提高到最大限度时，要进一步提高产量，就取决于粒数和粒重了。粒数的潜力是很大的，因为它可向空间发展。千粒穗的出现，为选育水稻高产品种开辟了广阔的途径。
    千粒穗初步培育成功了，要使之能应用到大田生产上去，还要进行很多的工作。诸如更有计划地进行系统选择、进一步提高结实率和充实度，以及在粒数的基础上提高粒重等方面的工作，都有待进一步研究。
