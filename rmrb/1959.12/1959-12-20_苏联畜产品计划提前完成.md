One of the Outstanding Achievements of the First Year of the Seven-Year Plan
Soviet Livestock Products Plan Completed Ahead of Schedule
Ryazan Oblast Achieves Best Results
Young Livestock: Increase Retention of Female Animals, More Mating and Breeding; Feed: Expand Sources, Diversify; Corn Sheds: Seize Time to Build More New Sheds

(People's Daily Moscow, December 19th, by our reporter Dai Feng) In the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union has made great achievements in livestock production. The increase in meat production has been particularly rapid, and the output of milk and animal fats has also greatly increased.

Since the beginning of the year, livestock producers across the Soviet Union have been particularly active in the production competition to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Various regions and states have successively proposed to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan's livestock product targets two to four years ahead of schedule. Subsequently, a nationwide competition to expand livestock production, focusing on a sharp increase in meat production, was launched enthusiastically. The competition achieved remarkable results. The state's annual procurement plan for livestock products was completed ahead of schedule in less than ten months, with targets surpassed.

This year, the most prominent feature of livestock production in the Soviet Union is the particularly rapid increase in meat production. It is estimated that the total amount of meat purchased by the state this year will reach 7.5 million tons, an increase of 1.8 million tons over last year and more than double the amount in 1953. The annual meat production increase plans of all Soviet republics have been completed one to two months ahead of schedule. For example, the Russian Federal Republic, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, and other republics, which play an important role in meat production, completed their annual meat production plans ahead of schedule in early November. During this period, livestock workers in Kazakhstan delivered 88% more meat to the state than last year, the Russian Federal Republic increased by 43%, Latvia increased by 73%, Estonia increased by 58%, and Ukraine increased by nearly 30%. At the same time, the total number of livestock in the Soviet Union has also increased significantly. As of October 1, collective farms and state farms across the Soviet Union owned 48 million head of large livestock, an increase of 18% over the same period last year; 46.22 million pigs, an increase of 19% over the same period last year; an increase of 4% in sheep; and an increase of 50% in poultry.

The pioneer of the meat production increase competition in the Soviet Union, the agricultural workers of Ryazan Oblast, have worked particularly well this year. They completed the meat production increase task for three years ahead of schedule in one year. In the first half of December, they delivered 150,000 tons of meat to the state. At the beginning of the competition, the masses in Ryazan Oblast mobilized together to concentrate their efforts on solving the primary problems in meat production: young livestock, feed, and livestock sheds. In expanding young livestock, Ryazan Oblast adopted the methods of increasing the retention of female animals, more mating and breeding, self-breeding and self-raising, and not slaughtering a single young animal, ensuring the highest survival rate of young livestock. Throughout the year, the breeding rate of calves, especially piglets, reached an unprecedented number. At the same time, the raising of chickens, ducks, and rabbits has also been vigorously developed. With the sharp increase in livestock, the need for feed has also increased. In solving the feed problem, Ryazan Oblast first adopted the method of expanding feed sources. Local farms have successively organized high-yield feed crop – corn production teams to increase the area of ​​corn cultivation. On the other hand, a large number of summer pastures were opened up in all places where grass could grow. Many feeders themselves planted miscellaneous grass feed on the open spaces near the livestock sheds during their spare time. At the same time, feed is used in a planned and quantitative manner so that it is supplied in a timely and sufficient manner. Livestock workers completed the annual livestock shed construction task in just over half a year, and built new livestock sheds that can accommodate more than 120,000 head of livestock.

In order to make livestock grow rapidly, Ryazan Oblast pays great attention to improving feeding methods, especially the management and feeding methods of young livestock. Farms in various districts of the state generally implemented the method of classifying livestock by shed, by period, and by division of labor, with special personnel responsible for feeding, and established a complete set of strict management systems for livestock feeding, grazing, and rest in different seasons. The feeders all have a "life diary" for managing livestock. According to the different living characteristics of livestock, they are treated separately for feeding and watering to ensure that each livestock is healthy and grows quickly. The livestock sheds in various farms are kept clean in terms of feed, clean in terms of utensils, and clean in terms of livestock sheds, preventing livestock diseases and ensuring the highest survival rate. Therefore, the average daily weight gain of cattle and pigs in the state is more than half a kilogram per head. At present, in order to welcome the upcoming December Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, the livestock product producers across the Soviet Union, who have achieved great victories, are working hard to seize the last half month before the end of the year to strive for greater achievements and present gifts to the Central Plenary Session. Some states and regions have put forward new and higher production targets after a year of hard work, and want to complete the Seven-Year Plan in a shorter period of time. The livestock producers across the Soviet Union are full of energy and confidence to prepare for greater achievements in 1960.

    七年计划第一年杰出成就之一
    苏联畜产品计划提前完成
    梁赞州成绩最出色
    幼畜：增留母畜多配多繁  饲料：扩大来源多种  玉米畜舍：争取时间多筑新舍
    本报莫斯科19日电　本报记者戴枫报道：在这七年计划第一年里，苏联在畜牧业生产方面获得很大成就。肉类增产速度特别快，奶类、动物油脂产量也大有增长。
    年初以来，全苏在争取提前完成七年计划的生产竞赛中，畜牧业生产者特别活跃。各地边疆区、州都纷纷提出了力争提前两年—四年完成七年规定的畜产品指标。接着全国就热火朝天的展开了以猛增肉类生产为中心的扩大畜产品生产竞赛。竞赛获得了显著成绩。不到十个月国家全年的畜产品采购计划就提前超额完成了。
    今年，苏联畜产品生产中最显明的特点是肉类增产速度特别快。据计算，今年国家肉类采购总数将达七百五十万吨，比去年增加一百八十万吨，比1953年增加一倍多。全苏各共和国的肉类年度增产计划都先后提前一两个月完成了。如在肉类生产中占有重要地位的俄罗斯联邦共和国和哈萨克斯坦、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚、乌克兰等共和国，在11月初就提前完成肉类年度生产计划。这期间哈萨克斯坦畜牧业劳动者交售给国家的肉类比去年增加88％，俄罗斯联邦共和国增加43％，拉脱维亚增加73％，爱沙尼亚增加58％，乌克兰增加将近30％。与此同时，全苏牲畜头数也增加了很多，到10月1日全苏集体农庄与国营农场所拥有的大家畜为四千八百万头，比去年同期增加18％，猪——四千六百二十万头，比去年同期增加19％，羊增加4％，家禽增加50％。
    全苏肉类增产竞赛的首创者——梁赞州农业劳动者，今年工作得尤其出色。他们提前在今年一年内完成了三年的肉类增产任务。12月上半月，交售给国家十五万吨肉类。竞赛开始时，梁赞州各地群众一齐动员起来，集中全力解决了肉类增产中的首要问题：幼畜、饲料、畜舍问题。在扩大幼畜方面，梁赞州采取了增留母畜，多配多繁，自繁自养和不杀一个幼畜的方法，保证了幼畜的最高成活率。全年，牛犊子尤其是猪崽的繁殖率达到了空前未有的数量。同时，也大力发展了养鸡鸭和养兔业。牲畜的猛增，饲料的需要随之增加。梁赞州在解决饲料问题时，首先采取了扩大饲料来源的办法。各地农庄先后组织高产饲料作物——玉米生产队，增加了玉米耕种面积。另方面，凡是能够长草的地方，大量开辟了夏季牧草场，许多饲养员自己在工余时，到畜舍近旁空地上种植杂草饲料。同时，有计划地、定量地利用饲料使饲料及时充分供应。畜牧业劳动者仅用半年多的时间就完成了全年的畜舍建造任务，建成了容纳十二万多头牲畜的新畜舍。
    为了使牲畜迅速成长，梁赞州非常注意改善饲养方法，尤其是对幼畜的管理饲养方法。全州各区农庄普遍实行了牲畜分类分棚、分期、分工，专人负责饲养的办法，建立了一整套各个季节牲畜喂食、放牧、休息等不同的严格管理制度。饲养员们都有一本管理牲畜的“生活日记”，根据牲畜不同的生活特性，分别对待进行喂料、喂水，保证牲畜个个健康快速成长。各地农庄畜舍都做到饲料干净，食具干净，畜舍干净，防止了牲畜病疫，保证了最高成活率。因此，全州的牛猪每昼夜平均每头长肉半公斤以上。目前，为了迎接即将到来的苏共中央十二月全会，获得了巨大胜利的全苏畜产品生产者都努力于抓紧年终前的最后半个月时间，争取更大成绩，向中央全会献礼。部分州、区经过一年努力又重新提出了新的更高的生产指标，要用更短的时间完成七年计划。全苏畜牧业生产者们精神奋发，信心百倍地准备在1960年争取更大的成就。
