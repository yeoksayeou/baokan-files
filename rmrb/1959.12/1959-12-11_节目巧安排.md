    Clever Program Arrangement
    After seeing the China Peking Opera Troupe's Fourth Troupe perform the "Single Act Program" evening, it left a feeling of being small-scale and colorful. The programs were: "Wu Song Fights the Inn," "Eliminating the Three Evils," "Universe Screen," and "Hongqiao Presents a Pearl." Although these are all well-known short plays, the program arrangement is very clever and can cater to the audience's preferences and interests in various aspects. In these programs, from the opening play "Wu Song Fights the Inn" with its two-person fight scene, to the grand finale of "Hongqiao Presents a Pearl" with its large-scale fighting and acrobatics, interspersed in the middle is a short and concise singing-focused play "Eliminating the Three Evils," mainly featuring male and painted-face roles, and "Universe Screen," mainly featuring female roles, with an emphasis on both singing and acting. The entire performance is truly: with both literary and martial elements, with both singing and acting, and with a complete range of characters. The melodies are also very rich, including some of the main singing styles in Peking Opera. In addition, the actors perform meticulously, the performance content is healthy, and the form is lively, so it is warmly welcomed by the audience, allowing the audience to be completely immersed in artistic cultivation and unwilling to leave the theater.
    Diversifying opera program performances is a good tradition in the opera world. It is hoped that in the future, various troupes and dance companies will pay more attention to the arrangement of programs when performing small-scale programs.

    节目巧安排
    看到中国京剧院四团演出的“单折节目”晚会后，给人留下一种小型多彩的感觉。其节目是：“武松打店”、“除三害”、“宇宙锋”、“虹桥赠珠”。虽然都是早已脍炙人口的小戏，但节目安排得很巧妙，能从各方面适应观众的爱好和兴趣。在这些节目里，从开场戏“武松打店”里双人对打到最后“虹桥赠珠”中大开打、大出手，中间穿插了一出以生、净为主的短小精悍的唱工戏“除三害”，和以旦为主的，唱、做并重的“宇宙锋”，整个演出真是：有文有武，有唱有做，角色俱全。曲调方面也很丰富，包括了京剧里一些主要唱腔，加上演员演得一丝不苟，演出内容健康，形式活泼，所以受到观众的热烈欢迎，使观众完全沉浸在艺术陶冶中，不想离开剧场。
    戏曲节目演出多样化，是戏曲界的优良传统。希望今后各剧团、歌舞团在演出小型节目时，多注意剧目的安排。
