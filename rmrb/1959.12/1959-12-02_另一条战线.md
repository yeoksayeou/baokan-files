Another Front
——Two Short Stories from Beijing Liulihe Cement Factory

A Bowl of Millet Porridge
　 Xiùyīng

　　In the deep of night, Liu Jianbang, the canteen administrator of the power workshop, was awakened by urgent knocking. He hurriedly put on his clothes and opened the door, only to see electrician Xiao Wang panting and saying, "My wife is about to give birth, what should I do?" Master Liu quickly rolled up his sleeves and said to Xiao Wang, "Go! Take care of your wife and get her to the hospital first, don't worry about anything else." Xiao Wang turned around and ran home, helping his wife into the factory's health station's delivery room.
　　"This is terrible, she just arrived a couple of days ago and is already giving birth. She doesn't have anything prepared, this is really urgent." Xiao Wang was so anxious he didn't know how many times he paced back and forth in front of the delivery room. It turned out that Xiao Wang's wife had only arrived in Liulihe from her hometown in the South two days earlier to see Xiao Wang. Her due date was originally more than a month away, and she hadn't prepared anything for the birth. Who knew that the journey's fatigue would bring on her labor early? She felt something was wrong the second day after arriving in Liulihe, her stomach often hurt. Xiao Wang asked his wife: could it be that she was going into labor? His wife thought her due date was still far off, so she didn't think she was. She kept putting it off until the third day, when she really went into labor. Xiao Wang thought, the factory is so busy with production, every person is crucial, we can't afford to lose anyone. How can I ask for leave! Even if I get leave, how will I take care of the new mother's meals, there isn't even a pot or stove at home. Just as Xiao Wang was anxiously pacing outside the door, the door of the delivery room opened, and the nurse said with a smile, "Congratulations, both mother and child are safe. You can go in and see them now." As soon as Xiao Wang heard that the baby was born, the joy of being a father drove away his earlier anxiety, and he rushed into the delivery room. His wife was lying quietly in bed, and the baby was sleeping sweetly in a clean white blanket. Before Xiao Wang could speak, his wife said with great unease, "I've caused you trouble. If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have come yet." Xiao Wang also suppressed his inner anxiety and said to his wife: "You rest quietly, I'll ask for a few days off!" Just then, with a knock on the door, canteen chef Liu came in with a food box in one hand and a paper bag in the other, smiling. Chef Liu jokingly said to Xiao Wang, "Your wife just arrived two days ago, and you're already holding a baby." Chef Liu opened the food box and asked Xiao Wang, "Why are you still standing there dazed, a new mother who's just given birth to such a little thing must be hungry, let her eat." Xiao Wang looked at the food box in Master Liu's hand, a box of hot millet porridge, and several eggs. Xiao Wang's tightly furrowed brows immediately relaxed: "Master Liu, I was just worrying about this!"
　　"What are you worrying about? Once you're in our canteen, we have to take care of everything." Chef Liu said, then poured the brown sugar from the paper bag into the porridge and handed it to the new mother. Xiao Wang's wife was so moved that it took her a long time to say a word: "Chef Liu, thank you."
　　"Eat quickly! What are you thanking me for? This little thing doesn't need thanks, this is what our canteen should do." Chef Liu turned around and said to Xiao Wang: "You go to your shift, the canteen will do better than you in terms of meals, just tell us what the new mother wants to eat, I'll make it and send it over."
　　Xiao Wang walked out of the hospital, and the morning glow had already appeared in the east. He walked happily into the workshop.
　　For many days in a row, the canteen delivered fresh vegetables, tasty hot soup, and hot meals to the delivery room for every meal. According to her living habits, the canteen also made dumplings for the new mother to eat on the seventh day. They also often made noodles. When the baby reached its one-month milestone, they steamed sugar buns.
　　The canteen administrator knows the workers' situations very well. He knows who's wife is about to give birth, and when. He often prepares millet, eggs, noodles, and brown sugar. If someone in a family is sick and can't eat, they take special care to cook soft rice for them. The canteen administrator is also the life administrator. If the workers have any needs in terms of food, clothing, and housing, they all ask them for help. With such caretakers, the workers are even more at ease with production. (Attached picture)

    另一条战线
    ——北京琉璃河水泥厂的两个小故事
    一锅小米粥
  　秀英
    酣睡的深夜，动力车间食堂管理员刘建邦被急剧的敲门声惊醒，他急急忙忙披上衣服，开了门，只见电工小王气喘呼呼地说：“我爱人要生孩子，怎么办？”刘师傅赶忙伸上了衣服袖子，对小王说：“去！先照顾你爱人上医院，别的事你就别管了。”小王回身就往家跑，扶着他爱人进了厂里保健站的产房。
    “真糟心，谁知道刚来了两天，就生孩子，要啥没啥，真急人。”急得小王不知道在产房门口来回走了多少圈。原来小王的爱人是前两天才由南方的家乡到琉璃河来看小王，距产期本来还有一个多月，生孩子用的东西什么都没准备，谁知道路途上的劳累，使她的产期提前了。她刚到琉璃河的第二天就觉着不对劲儿，肚子时常痛。小王问他爱人：会不会是要生孩子，他爱人认为产期还早，不会生，一直拖到第三天，孩子真的要生了。小王想，厂里生产那么忙，现在是一个萝卜顶一个坑，少一个都不行，怎么能请假呢！即使请下假，我又怎样侍候产妇这几顿饭呢，家里连个锅灶都没有。正当小王焦急地在门外徘徊的时候，产房的门开了，护士满面笑容地说：“恭喜你，孩子大人都平安，现在你可以进去看看了。”小王一听说孩子生下来了，初作父亲的喜悦赶走了他刚才的焦虑，他三步两步地走进了产房。他爱人正安静地躺在床上，孩子也在洁白的小被子里睡得正甜。还没等小王说话，他爱人感到万分不安地说：“给你找来麻烦了，要知道这样，我就先不来了。”小王也抑制着内心的焦虑，对他爱人说：你安静地休息，我请几天假吧！”正当这时候，随着敲门声，食堂刘司釜一手提着一个饭盒，这只手里还攥着个纸包，笑呵呵地走进来了，刘司釜和小王打趣地说：“你爱人刚来这么两天，你就抱上娃娃了。”刘司釜打开饭盒问着小王：“还发什么怔，月子人生下这么个小东西，也该饿了，让她吃吧。”小王顺着刘师傅拿饭盒的手一看，一盒热腾腾的小米粥，还有好几个鸡蛋，小王刚才紧锁着的双眉立刻舒展开了：“刘师傅，我正在为这个事发愁呢！”
    “发什么愁，入了咱们的食堂，就得什么都管。”刘师傅说着又把纸包里的红糖倒在粥里，送到产妇的面前。小王的爱人感动的半天才说出了一句话：“刘司釜，谢谢您。”
      “快吃吧！谢什么？这点小事用不着谢，这是我们食堂应该作的事情。”刘师傅回转身子对小王说：“你去上你的班，吃饭的事我们食堂会比你作的更好，月子人想吃什么尽管说，我做了就给送来。”
    小王从医院走出来，东方已经露出了朝霞，他愉快地走进了车间。
    一连多少天，食堂顿顿都是把新鲜的蔬菜，有滋味的热汤、热饭送到产房。食堂还按照生活习惯，七天还给生孩子人包了一顿饺子吃。还经常给做面条。孩子过满月还给蒸了糖馒头。
    食堂的管理员对工人的情况摸得很清，谁的爱人要生孩子了，什么时候，他都知道，经常给准备些小米、鸡蛋、挂面和红糖。谁家有了病人，不能吃饭，他们就特别照顾，给做点软饭送去。食堂管理员也就是生活管理员，工人的吃、穿、住各方面有什么需要，都找他们帮助解决，工人们有了这样的管家人，生产就更安心了。（附图片）
