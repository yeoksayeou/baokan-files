Technical Innovation Transports More Timber
Tóng Huáyì, Deputy Director of the Tonghe Forestry Bureau, Heilongjiang Province

The Tonghe Forestry Bureau has earnestly implemented the "Three-izations" (mechanization of forestry production, rapid and high-yield forest growth, and comprehensive utilization of timber) and "Four Self-Sufficiencies" (mostly self-sufficient in iron and steel, machinery, oil, vegetables, and meat) forestry development direction proposed by the Provincial Party Committee. We adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, launch mass movements centered on tool reform, break free from the seasonal constraints of timber production, basically achieve year-round operation, and continuously achieve leaps forward in production. This year's plan was completed sixty days ahead of schedule.

            Implement the Policy of Walking on Two Legs

Before 1958, every winter, the Tonghe Forestry Bureau had to mobilize a large number of horses to go up the mountains for a concentrated transportation effort, because production was constrained by the seasons and timber was stranded on the mountains and could not be transported down. At the beginning of last year, the Tonghe Forestry Bureau Party Committee analyzed the internal and external situation of the enterprise and proposed "working hard for two years to basically achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization of collection (of timber), transportation (of timber), loading (onto vehicles), and sorting (of logs), gradually eliminating horses going up the mountains, and achieving year-round operation." In the process of achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization, we earnestly implemented the "walking on two legs" policy proposed by the Central Committee, adhered to the principle of first indigenous, then foreign, combining foreign and indigenous methods, and arming ourselves, and launched a large-scale mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on vigorously promoting tool reform. In the past two years, the masses have created, innovated, and promoted more than 30 kinds of new timber collection tools. After testing and appraisal, 16 types have been finalized. These new tools make full use of the favorable natural conditions, enabling the timber collection process to basically achieve cableway-ization, slide-way-ization, vehicle-ization, and channel-ization, increasing efficiency by 45.3% and reducing heavy physical labor. This year, we have created three major assembly line operation experiences, such as using tractors to release trolleys and using heavy trolleys to bring empty trolleys up the mountain, linking new tools with mechanized operations, reducing redundant operation processes, and loading the timber collected by the new tools onto the forest railway trolleys, further increasing production efficiency by 30% to 50%. A total of 544 laborers were saved throughout the year.

              Adhere to Putting Politics in Command

When the Party Committee put forward the requirement of developing year-round operation, it encountered two ideological obstacles: one was "the theory of conditions," which held that the forest farm conditions in the Tonghe forest area were not good, it was an over-cut forest area, the output was low, and the mountain angles were high, so year-round operation could not be carried out; the other was emphasizing "foreign" and downplaying "indigenous," believing that to carry out year-round operation, foreign machinery was needed, "no oxen (animal power) but iron oxen (tractors) were needed." In response to these situations, the Party Committee fully mobilized the masses to carry out large-scale debates, first solving ideological problems, and using the method of "if you don't understand, debate; if you don't believe, look; if you don't know how, learn; if you learn, do," to strengthen the confidence of the masses, boost morale, and greatly promote the development of the movement.

As the movement continued to deepen, new problems continued to emerge. Last winter, there was heavy frost and snow, and accidents frequently occurred with smooth-rail flatcars. The onlookers and doubters raised their heads again, saying "the new tools won't work in winter." The leadership promptly grasped the new tools for winter operations created by the staff of the Red Flag Forest Farm and the Fen Dou (Struggle) Forest Farm, such as ice-channel sleds, and promptly promoted them, so that the daily output in winter reached 3,500 cubic meters, with a maximum of 6,300 cubic meters. Since the beginning of spring this year, due to the lack of experience in production management of timber collection with new tools, the timber transportation volume of forest railways has been affected. Some people spread right-leaning remarks, saying "if one finger is rotten, ten fingers are in danger." At this time, the Party Committee criticized this kind of thinking and promptly proposed to get forest railway trolleys up the mountains, reformed the forest railway transportation methods, increased the daily timber transportation volume of forest railways from 2,400 cubic meters to 3,200 cubic meters, and further boosted the enthusiasm of the masses. Facts have proved that only by adhering to putting politics in command and doing a good job in political and ideological work can the technical innovation and technical revolution movement be carried out in depth.

            Rely on the Masses, There Are Many Methods

In the process of technical reform, the Tonghe Forestry Bureau insisted on carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and promptly put forward clear goals and tasks to the masses. Whenever difficulties were encountered, they were handed over to the masses to study and solve. After each farm carried out year-round operations, difficulties arose such as insufficient steel cables, light rails, and flatcars. The Party Committee led the masses to use wood to transport wood and obtain materials locally to solve the contradiction of insufficient materials. The staff and workers gave play to their creativity and successfully tested yin-yang rails (one side wooden rail, one side steel rail), which played a great role in production. The staff and workers also collected a lot of scrap iron, which solved the cast iron needed to manufacture small wheel vehicles, enabling production to continue to move forward.

    革新技术　多运木材
    黑龙江省通河林业局副局长　佟华义
    通河林业局认真贯彻执行了省委提出的“三化”（林业生产机械化、林木生长快速丰产化、木材利用综合化）、“四自给”（大部分钢铁、机械、油料、蔬菜和肉类自给）的林业发展方向，坚持政治挂帅，大闹技术革新和技术革命，开展以工具改革为中心的群众运动，摆脱了木材生产的季节性束缚，基本上实现了常年作业，生产获得了不断跃进。今年的计划提前六十天完成。
            贯彻两条腿走路的方针
    在1958年以前，每年的冬季，通河林业局都要动员大批马套子上山，突击运输，因为生产受季节的束缚，木材困在山上运不下来。去年年初，通河林业局党委分析了企业内部外部的形势，提出了“苦战二年，基本实现集（材）、运（材）、装（车）、归（楞）的半机械化和机械化，逐步取消马套子上山，实现常年作业”。在实现机械化、半机械化的过程中，认真贯彻执行了中央提出的“两条腿走路”方针，坚持先土后洋，洋土结合，自己武装自己的原则，开展一个规模壮阔的、以大搞工具改革为中心的群众性的技术革新与技术革命运动。两年来，群众创造、革新、推广了三十多种集材新工具，经过试验鉴定，已经定型的有十六种，这些新工具充分利用了天时地利，使集材工序基本实现了索道化、滑道化、车子化、槽道化，效率提高45.3％，减轻了笨重的体力劳动。今年又创造了用拖拉机溜放台车和以重台车带空台车上山等三大流水作业经验，把新工具和机械化作业联结起来，减少了重复作业过程，新工具集材下来就装到森铁台车上，生产效率又提高30％到50％。全年节约劳动力五百四十四个。
              坚持政治挂帅
    当党委提出发展常年作业的要求时，曾经遇到了两种思想障碍：一种是“唯条件论”，认为通河林区的林场条件不好，是过伐林区，出材量低，山角高，不能搞常年作业；另一种是重“洋”轻“土”，认为要搞常年作业就要洋机械，“不要黄牛（畜力）要铁牛（拖拉机）”。党委针对这些情况，充分发动群众开展大辩论，首先解决思想问题，用“不通就辩、不信就看、不会就学、学会就干”的方法，坚定了群众的信心，鼓舞了士气，大大推动了运动的开展。
    随着运动的不断深入，又不断出现新问题。去年冬季，霜大有雪，滑杠平车常出事故，观潮派和怀疑派又重新抬头，说“新工具到冬季就不行了”。领导上及时抓住了红旗林场和奋斗林场职工创造的冰槽爬犁等冬季作业的新工具，及时加以推广，使冬季的日产量达到三千五百立方米，最高达到六千三百立方米。今年入春以来，由于搞新工具集材在生产管理上还缺乏经验，影响了森林铁路的运材量。有人又散布右倾言论，说什么“一个指头烂了，十个指头也危险”。这时党委又对这种思想进行了批判，并且及时提出搞森铁台车上山，改革了森铁运输方法，使森铁的日运材量由二千四百立方米，提高到三千二百立方米，进一步鼓舞了群众的积极性。事实证明，只有坚持政治挂帅，做好政治思想工作，才能把技术革新和技术革命运动不断深入地开展起来。
            依靠群众办法多
    在技术改革过程中，通河林业局坚持大搞群众运动，及时向群众提出明确的奋斗目标和任务，每逢遇到困难，都交给群众研究解决。各场开展常年作业以后，曾经出现了钢索、轻轨、平车等工具器材不足的困难，党委就领导群众以木运木、就地取材，解决材料不足的矛盾。职工群众发挥了创造性，试验成功了阴阳轨（一边木轨、一边钢轨），对生产起了很大作用。职工们还收集了许多废铁，解决了制造小轮车所需的铸铁问题，使生产不断向前发展。
