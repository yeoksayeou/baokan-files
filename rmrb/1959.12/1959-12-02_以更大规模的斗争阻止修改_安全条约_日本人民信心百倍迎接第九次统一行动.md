Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - The secretariat of the National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" decided today at a meeting on a plan for the ninth nationwide unified action against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," scheduled for December 10th. This plan stipulates that a struggle of greater scale than the eighth unified action will be launched on the ninth unified action day, with striking workers as the backbone. According to this decision, people will not only raise demands regarding opposition to the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the ninth unified action, but will also protest against the police's attacks on participants in the eighth nationwide unified action.

The Executive Committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Council of Trade Unions also decided today at an enlarged meeting on a plan for workers' actions on the planned ninth unified action day.

According to the resolution, the Tokyo Metropolitan Council of Trade Unions ("Sohyo" Tokyo Local Council) will call on Tokyo workers to strike and hold a petition movement on a larger scale than the eighth unified action, demanding that the Diet take action to prevent the government from revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The resolution said that the struggle deployment of organizations in various districts of Tokyo should be strengthened; and the government's current repressive measures against workers should be crushed.

The secretariat unanimously agreed that the large-scale petition movement held on November 27 greatly encouraged the workers and filled them with confidence in their own strength.

A letter from the Hokkaido Workers' United Struggle Committee Against Revision of the "Security Treaty" was read at the meeting of the secretariat. The letter said that the success of the Tokyo petition movement encouraged 300,000 Hokkaido workers. They pledged their full support to the Tokyo workers. The letter also criticized the government's repressive measures against Tokyo demonstrators. The letter also guaranteed that Hokkaido workers would do everything possible to ensure the great success of the ninth nationwide unified action day.
