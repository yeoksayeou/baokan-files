Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch: According to TASS, Eskalante, Executive Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, published an article on the Cuban revolution in the Soviet "Pravda." He wrote: The purpose of the Cuban revolution is: to eliminate the domestic feudal remnants through a broad united front formed by all forces, to distribute land to peasants and agricultural workers free of charge, to develop industry and the country's entire economy, to strive for complete national independence, and to advance along the path of democracy, progress, and peace.

Eskalante pointed out that the establishment of the Cuban revolutionary regime has caused a desperate counterattack by the reactionaries, especially the counterattack by the reactionaries' backstage boss and the Cuban people's number one enemy—American imperialism. However, the revolution has received strong support from the vast majority of the people (about 90%), who are full of revolutionary spirit and deeply inspired by revolutionary measures, protecting and supporting the government.

Eskalante condemned American imperialism for attempting to subdue and suffocate Cuba by various economic means, such as threatening to reduce Cuban sugar imports in the American market, lowering Cuban sugar prices, and obstructing normal trade between the United States and Cuba. In terms of foreign policy, the United States is trying to isolate Cuba. Reactionary newspapers carried out a frantic anti-Cuba propaganda campaign. The U.S. State Department used every excuse, especially the lie of so-called "communist danger," to provoke Latin American governments against the Cuban revolution and lure them to participate in the imperialist-instigated intervention in Cuba.

Eskalante wrote: The Cuban revolution will never give up its indisputable rights and achievements. We must take defensive measures to repel the enemy's conspiracy to undermine the Cuban economy. These measures include: controlling foreign trade and the activities of foreign banks, strictly protecting national currency, foreign exchange, and gold reserves, consolidating and protecting national industry, increasing the production of imported goods that are most important to domestic needs, nationalizing mineral resources such as oil, and expanding Cuba's foreign markets.

Eskalante concluded: If imperialism instigates its pawns in countries such as the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua to invade Cuba, they will be met with gunfire sufficient to eliminate all enemies from Cuban territory. If the American ruling clique is blinded by greed and dares to launch an aggression against Cuba, the Cuban people will rise up unanimously to defend their motherland. Cuba was not, and will never be, the disaster-ridden Guatemala of 1954!

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 12th: The Cuban Revolutionary Directorate issued a statement today saying that it is ready at any time, under the leadership of the revolutionary government, to "defend our people against any aggression, no matter where it comes from." The statement was signed by the main leaders of the organization.

The statement condemned "war criminals, Batista elements, Trujillo mercenaries, weakened large landowners, domestic and foreign monopoly organizations and interest groups, corrupt politicians, and reactionaries" who are currently conspiring to launch a "cunning aggression against the Cuban people" to prevent them from winning victory. The statement said that in the face of this situation, "all Cubans who love the motherland" have only one obligation: "to join the battlefront for the revolution."

The statement emphasized that the "fortress" for defending the revolution is the unity of the entire people.

The Revolutionary Directorate today called for the organization of militias to defend the motherland and established offices for registering militias.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 11th: The Cuban Revolutionary Court began trying Ubert Matos, the ringleader of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy uncovered in October and former commander of the Camagüey Province forces, in Havana this afternoon.

While in office, Matos colluded with large landowners and foreign monopoly capital to conspire to undermine land reform and, together with Cuba's domestic and foreign enemies, plotted a plan to subvert the government.

During the trial, Matos admitted that he had incited all officers in the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces who were connected with him to oppose the revolutionary policies of the Cuban government headed by Prime Minister Castro.

He also admitted that he had connections with Cuban traitors, former President Urrutia and former Air Force Commander Díaz Lanz, and even held meetings with them after their betrayal.

During the trial, Matos also attempted to whitewash the counter-revolutionary crimes of Urrutia and Díaz Lanz.

For example, he even described Díaz Lanz's slanderous attacks on Cuba before the United States Senate committee and his crimes of strafing and bombing Havana residents as merely "deviating from the revolutionary ideological track."

It was revealed that Dominican dictator Trujillo, in a letter to Cuban counter-revolutionaries, pointed out that Matos was the person to rely on when implementing the plan to invade Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 12th: Cuban war criminals who have fled to the United States continue to conspire in Miami, Florida, to carry out subversive activities against the Cuban government.

According to a report today in "Revolución," the organ of the Cuban "26th of July Movement," Batista bandits held a meeting in Miami on the 11th to discuss plans for implementing "personal assassinations, invasions, and other terrorist activities." Participants in the meeting included Orlando Piedra, former head of the "Bureau of Investigation" of the Batista dictatorship, former Senators Masferrer and Rey Perna, and Portuondo, former chief representative of the Cuban delegation to the United Nations.

The news said that former Air Force Commander Díaz Lanz, a traitor to the Cuban people, also maintains close contact with these people.

On the same day, the Cuban "National Daily" published news from Miami City saying that Augusto Ferrando, the consul of the Dominican dictatorship in Miami City, admitted to giving $1,400 to U.S. customs officials in Miami City to ship weapons for Cuban counter-revolutionaries. Ferrando also said that he had received a "large sum of money" from former Cuban Senator Rey Perna for the transportation of weapons. The person responsible for transporting the weapons was Dominic Bartome, a salesman for the American "Cleveland Aviation Power Company" and a Batista element.

As everyone knows, Batista elements once cooperated with the Miami police to use the name of the aforementioned airline to transport weapons from Miami International Airport to the Dominican Republic to supply Batista bandits there.

Although Ferrando and Bartome confessed to their above-mentioned crimes in a trial in a U.S. court in Miami, they were still acquitted by the U.S. court without any hindrance.

    美国继续伙同古巴逃亡分子策划颠覆阴谋
    古巴人民坚决反击反革命活动
    新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：古巴人民社会党执行书记艾斯卡兰特在苏联“真理报”上发表了一篇关于古巴革命的文章。他写道：古巴革命的目的是：通过一切力量所结成的广泛的统一战线来消灭国内的封建残余，无偿地把土地分配给农民和农业工人，发展工业和国家的整个经济，争取民族完全独立，并且沿着民主、进步与和平的道路前进。
    艾斯卡兰特指出，古巴革命政权的建立引起了反动派的拼命反扑，特别是反动派的后台老板、古巴人民的头号敌人——美帝国主义的反扑。但是革命受到了绝大多数人民群众（约90％）的大力支持，他们满怀革命精神，深受革命措施的鼓舞，保护并拥护政府。
    艾斯卡兰特谴责美帝国主义企图用各种经济手段使古巴屈服和窒息，例如威胁削减美国市场上古巴糖的进口额、压低古巴糖价、阻挠美国同古巴之间进行正常贸易等等。在外交政策方面，美国企图孤立古巴。反动报纸进行了疯狂的反古巴宣传运动。美国国务院利用一切借口，特别是利用所谓“共产主义危险”的谎言来挑拨拉丁美洲国家政府反对古巴革命，并引诱它们参加帝国主义策动的对古巴的干涉。
    艾斯卡兰特写道：古巴革命决不会放弃它的无可争辩的权利和成果。我们一定要采取防御措施，击退敌人企图破坏古巴经济的阴谋。这些措施包括：控制对外贸易和外国银行的活动，严格保护本国货币、外汇和黄金储备，巩固并保护民族工业，增加那些对国内需要最重要的进口商品的生产，把石油等矿藏资源收归国有，扩大古巴的国外市场。
    艾斯卡兰特最后写道：如果帝国主义唆使他们在多米尼加和尼加拉瓜等国的走卒来侵犯古巴，那么他们将会遭到枪炮的回击，这些枪炮足以把所有的敌人从古巴的领土上消灭干净。如果美国统治集团冲昏头脑，胆敢对古巴发动侵略，古巴人民会一致奋起保卫自己的祖国。古巴过去不是、将来也决不是1954年多灾多难的危地马拉！
    新华社哈瓦那12日电　古巴革命指导委员会今天发表声明说，它随时准备在革命政府领导下“保卫我国人民，反对任何侵略，不管它是来自何方”。这个声明是由这个组织的主要领导人签署的。
    声明谴责“战争罪犯、巴蒂斯塔分子、特鲁希略雇佣兵、遭到削弱的大庄园主、国内外的垄断组织和利益集团、腐朽的政客和反动分子”目前正在密谋对“古巴人民进行狡猾的侵略”，以阻挠他们赢得胜利。声明说，面对这种情况，“一切热爱祖国的古巴人”只有一个义务：“走上为革命而斗争的战线”。
    声明强调指出，保卫革命的“堡垒”是全国人民的团结。
    革命指导委员会今天号召组织民兵保卫祖国，并且设立了登记民兵的办事处。
    新华社哈瓦那11日电　古巴革命法庭今天下午开始在哈瓦那审判10月间破获的反革命阴谋案首犯、前卡马圭省部队司令乌维尔特·马托斯。
    马托斯在任职期间，曾勾结大地主和外国垄断资本阴谋破坏土地改革，并且和古巴的国内外敌人一起策划颠覆政府的计划。
    在审讯中马托斯承认，他曾煽动古巴革命武装部队中一切与他有联系的军官起来反对以卡斯特罗总理为首的古巴政府的革命方针。
    他还承认他同古巴叛徒、前总统乌鲁蒂亚和前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯有联系，甚至在他们叛变之后，他还同他们举行过会议。
    马托斯在审讯过程中还企图为乌鲁蒂亚和迪亚斯·兰斯的反革命罪行粉饰。
    例如，他竟然把迪亚斯·兰斯在美国参议院委员会上对古巴的造谣攻击以及他驾驶飞机扫射和轰炸哈瓦那居民的罪行，说成仅仅是“越出了革命的思想轨道”。
    据揭露，多米尼加独裁者特鲁希略在写给古巴的反革命分子的一封信中曾经指出，马托斯是在实行入侵古巴的计划时应该依靠的人。
    新华社哈瓦那12日电　潜逃在美国的古巴战争罪犯继续在美国佛罗里达州的迈阿密城阴谋策划对古巴政府进行颠覆活动。
    据古巴“7月26日运动”机关报“革命报”今天报道，巴蒂斯塔匪徒11日在迈阿密城举行会议，讨论实行“个人暗杀、入侵和其他恐怖活动”的计划。参加这次会议的有巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的前“调查局”局长奥尔兰多·彼德拉、前参议员马斯费雷尔和雷伊·佩尔纳、联合国古巴代表团前首席代表波尔图翁多等。
    消息说，古巴人民的叛徒前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯也同这些人保持着密切的联系。
    同一天，古巴“国民日报”刊载迈阿密城的消息说，多米尼加独裁政权驻迈阿密城的领事奥古斯托·费兰多承认曾经交给美国迈阿密城的海关官员一千四百块美元，以便装运出供应古巴反革命分子的武器。费兰多还表示，他已经收到古巴前参议员雷伊·佩尔纳寄给他的用于运送武器的“大笔款项”。负责运送武器的是美国“克利夫兰航空动力公司”的销售商、巴蒂斯塔分子多米尼克·巴托梅。
    大家知道，巴蒂斯塔分子曾经跟迈阿密警察合作，用上述航空公司的名义载运武器从迈阿密国际机场运往多米尼加共和国，以便供给在那里的巴蒂斯塔匪徒。
    尽管费兰多和巴托梅在迈阿密的美国法庭的一次审讯中供认了他们的上述罪行，但是他们仍然毫无阻碍地被美国法庭宣布无罪释放。
