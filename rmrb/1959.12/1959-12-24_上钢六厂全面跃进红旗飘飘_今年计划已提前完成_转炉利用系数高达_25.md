Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd: The Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, a national red-banner unit for converter steelmaking, mobilized the masses to innovate equipment and operations, constantly overcoming difficulties encountered in the continued Great Leap Forward. After completing this year's national steelmaking plan 28 days ahead of schedule, it also completed the plant's steelmaking Great Leap Forward plan 16 days ahead of schedule. As of December 3rd, the plant's steel output fulfilled 100.64% of the annual plan, with cumulative output increasing by more than 50% compared to the previous year; total output value fulfilled 100.53% of the state plan, an increase of 91.24% compared to the previous year. The converter utilization coefficient (fixed furnace seat) gradually increased from 1.68 at the beginning of the year to 25, reaching the highest level in the country. The steel's qualified rate stabilized at 98%, and the first-class product rate reached a maximum of 81%, all meeting national requirements. The average iron consumption per ton of steel decreased from 1,600 kilograms last year to about 1,280 kilograms this year. In the sixteen days after completing the state plan, this plant has increased steel production by 6,300 tons for the country.

	The converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 is a workshop with narrow factory buildings and simple equipment in the Shanghai metallurgical system. There were also many difficulties encountered in production this year. 90% of the pig iron used for steelmaking is native iron with high sulfur content, and most of the coke used in the iron smelting furnace is also native coke made in the factory. Therefore, a series of difficulties were encountered, such as low melting rate of the iron smelting furnace, long converter blowing time, and short furnace life. However, the workers of this plant were not frightened by the difficulties. At the beginning of the year, they put forward the bold slogan of "Making high sulfur bow its head, and turning native iron into steel." All cadres, workers, and technicians in the plant were mobilized to carry out a series of research and experiments around controlling the chemical composition of molten iron, improving the structure of iron smelting furnaces and converters, and innovating operating techniques. From January to May, after continuous experimentation, analysis, and accumulation of experience, they finally summarized a complete set of advanced experience such as "strengthening blasting" and "thin layer and frequent additions" for iron smelting furnaces, and "steelmaking starts with furnace making" for converters, which greatly improved the melting rate of molten iron, generally extended the life of the converter furnace, and increased steel production from 210 tons per day in January to 290 tons per day in May.

	Under the guidance of the spirit of continuous revolution and continuous leap forward, the workers of this plant also found an important experience in making steel with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In the first half of October, the plant's steel output had leaped to a level of more than 420 tons per day, doubling the output in January. At this time, the crane, ingot casting, and slag removal work in the workshop were very tense. Especially after the increase in steel production, the amount of steel slag also increased greatly. Because there was not enough time to remove the steel slag, the converter could not often fully play its role. The leading cadres and the masses of this factory were determined not to let the pace of the Great Leap Forward stop. On the one hand, they launched a red-banner competition between groups in ingot casting and slag removal to strive to improve work efficiency. On the other hand, they mobilized steelmakers to find more advanced steelmaking methods that meet the requirements of greater, faster, better, and more economical results. After continuous exploration and research, they finally creatively and successfully tested the steelmaking operation method of adding less lime slag, breaking the superstition that high-sulfur iron must be refined with more lime and more slag. After using the new operation method for steelmaking in the second half of October, not only could dozens of kilograms of lime be added less per ton of steel, reducing the amount of steel slag, but also reducing the number of slag making and shortening the smelting time, so that steel production quickly leaped from an average daily output of 424 tons in the first half of the month to 462 tons, while iron consumption was further reduced and quality was also improved, achieving the requirements of an all-round Great Leap Forward with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

　　上钢六厂全面跃进红旗飘飘
    今年计划已提前完成　转炉利用系数高达25
    据新华社上海23日电　全国转炉炼钢红旗单位——上海第六钢铁厂，发动群众革新设备和操作，不断克服继续跃进中遇到的困难，在提前二十八天全面完成今年的国家炼钢计划以后，又提前十六天完成了本厂的炼钢跃进计划。到12月3日止，这个厂的钢产量完成全年计划100.64％，累计产量比去年全年增长50％以上；总产值完成国家计划100.53％，比去年增长91.24％。转炉利用系数（固定式炉座）从年初的一一点六八，逐步上升到二十五，达到全国最高水平。钢的合格率稳定在98％，一级品率最高达到81％，都达到国家的要求。每吨钢的平均用铁量从去年一千六百公斤下降到今年一千二百八十公斤左右。在完成国家计划后的十六天中，这个厂已为国家增产钢六千三百吨。
    上钢六厂转炉车间是上海冶金系统中一个厂房狭窄、设备简陋的车间。今年生产中遇到的困难也是很多的，炼钢用的生铁90％是含硫量较高的土铁，化铁炉用的焦炭也大部分是自己厂里炼出来的土焦。因此，遇到了化铁炉熔化率低、转炉吹炼时间长、炉子寿命短等一系列困难。但是，这个厂的职工没有给困难吓住。他们从年初就提出了“叫高硫低头、要土铁成钢”的豪迈口号。全厂干部、工人和技术人员都动员起来，围绕着控制铁水化学成分，改进化铁炉、转炉的结构和革新操作技术等方面，进行一系列的研究试验。从1月到5月，经过不断试验、分析和积累经验，终于总结出化铁炉“强化鼓风”、“薄层勤加”、转炉“炼钢先炼炉”等整套先进经验，使铁水熔化率大为提高，转炉炉龄普遍延长，钢产量从1月份日产二百一十吨，逐步上升到5月份的日产二百九十吨。
    在不断革命和不断跃进思想的指导下，这个厂的职工还找到了一条多快好省炼钢的重要经验。10月上半月，这个厂的钢产量已跃进到日产四百二十多吨的水平，比1月份的产量翻了一番。这时，车间里的行车、浇钢和清渣工作显得十分紧张。尤其是增加钢产量后，钢渣数量也大量增多，因为来不及出清钢渣，转炉常常不能充分发挥它的作用。这个厂的领导干部和群众决心不让跃进的步伐停下来。他们一方面在浇钢、清渣等工种间开展组与组红旗竞赛运动，努力提高工作效率，另一方面发动炼钢工寻找符合多快好省要求的更先进的炼钢方法。经过不断的摸索和钻研，终于创造性地试验成功了少加石灰渣料的炼钢操作法，打破了用高硫铁炼钢必须多加石灰多造渣的迷信。10月下半月用新操作法炼钢后，不仅每吨钢可以少加几十公斤的石灰，减少了钢渣数量，而且也减少了造渣次数和缩短了冶炼时间，使钢的产量从上半月平均日产四百二十四吨，迅速地跃进到四百六十二吨，同时铁耗进一步降低，质量也有所提高，达到多快好省全面跃进的要求。
