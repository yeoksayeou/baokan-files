Eliminating Shoulder Carrying and Manual Lifting
    ——Longwantao Water Conservancy Project Vigorously Promotes Technological Innovation
    By our reporter Jiang Tao
    Stepping into the Longwantao Water Conservancy Project in Sishui County, Shandong, one can hear the sound of motors and handcarts everywhere. Looking around, a unique new scene unfolds: more than 22,000 water conservancy construction workers are orderly operating newly created and modified tools, dashing across the vast construction site. Cartloads of yellow soil shuttle back and forth, power-driven carts slowly climb to the top of the 13-meter-high dam from the bottom, and manpower-pulled pulley carts go up and down. Makeshift derricks continuously lift baskets full of soil onto the carts, and tractors repeatedly compact the newly laid soil layers.
    The Longwantao Reservoir has a dam 300 meters long and 29 meters high, with a storage capacity of over 100 million cubic meters, and can irrigate 240,000 mu of farmland. It is one of the largest key projects in Sishui County. Its first phase of construction began in mid-November 1958. At that time, due to insufficient focus on tool reform, work efficiency was not high. More than 6,000 laborers worked for seven months and only completed 39.4% of the total project task, and most of the project had to be completed this winter. As the reservoir dam became higher and higher, the distance for transporting soil became longer and longer, and the amount of labor increased relatively. In addition, with the lack of tools, insufficient labor, and short time, completing this task became more and more arduous. To solve this problem, the Sishui County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to mobilize the masses to carry out technological reform. However, due to the conservative thinking of some leading cadres, who did not believe in the wisdom of the masses, technological reform had not been carried out effectively before. For example, more than 6,700 meters of iron rails were transported to the construction site, but only a few technicians laid them, and it took twelve days to lay 920 meters. At this speed, it would take two months to complete the laying; even the rails that had been laid were crooked and uneven, and no one was willing to use them.
    With the help of the County Party Committee, the construction site Party Committee summarized the experiences and lessons learned from the failure to launch the movement. On the one hand, it conducted in-depth socialist education from top to bottom and from within the Party to outside the Party, and launched a debate on whether to carry out tool reform and who to rely on for reform, thoroughly criticizing all kinds of conservative ideas. Then, under the slogan of "using tools to gain labor and using tools to compete for time," the broad masses used their brains and offered suggestions, launching a vigorous tool reform movement. On the other hand, it also convened on-site meetings combining veteran farmers, cadres, and technicians to "diagnose" the iron rails that had been laid but could not be used. After adopting the operating method of operating while finding the cause, researching, repairing, and assigning special personnel and vehicles with numbered operations, the method of transporting soil by iron rails was quickly promoted, which was much easier than shoulder carrying and manual lifting. The masses were mobilized, and more than 5,400 meters of iron rails were laid in three days and nights. The Jinzhuang labor team, led by Secretary Meng Chuanxi, took the lead and everyone worked together to lay 480 meters of iron rails in more than three hours. The technological reform leaped from backward to advanced unit. Now a large number of iron-wheeled carts are running on thirteen iron rails totaling more than 6,000 meters long at the construction site.
    The benefits of tool reform have continuously encouraged the confidence of the broad masses. In less than ten days, the masses put forward more than 300 rationalization proposals. According to the rationalization proposals put forward by the masses, more than ten types of equipment, including pulley-driven climbing devices, rail turntables, ferry cars, double-track cyclic operators, stone sheep horn rollers, and automatic soil loading devices, have been successfully tested and widely promoted, totaling more than 1,000 pieces. These tools generally improve work efficiency by several times to dozens of times. Zhu Qingxi and other four technological innovation experts from the County Machinery Factory used a 45-horsepower gas engine to modify a small locomotive, which can carry fifteen carts at a time. Working ten hours a day, it can transport more than 100 cubic meters of soil, which can replace 100 laborers. The vertical power-driven climbing device created by the masses can pull more than 1,000 kilograms each time on a 28-meter-long slope with a considerable gradient, and can pull once every 20 seconds, which is more than 20 times more efficient than manual labor. Using explosives to break the soil, up to 500 cubic meters can be blasted at a time, which is more than 70 times more efficient than manual labor. Now this construction site has realized power traction for climbing slopes, rolling compaction for tamping, blasting for opening rocks and loosening soil, and rail transportation of soil, basically eliminating shoulder carrying and manual lifting.
    With the development of tool reform and the large-scale promotion and use of advanced tools, labor has been greatly saved and physical labor has been reduced. Female laborers Zhao Yejuju and Qiao Zhirong from the Jinzhuang labor team said: In the past, two people carried soil 25 times a day, totaling a little over one cubic meter of soil, and felt a little tired; now they have switched to pushing handcarts, pushing 58 times a day, totaling eight cubic meters of soil, and feel very relaxed.
    The original plan was to complete the entire project in 150 days. After tool reform, it is expected to be completed 80 days ahead of schedule. Now the broad masses have put forward the resounding slogan of "Using brains around the project, breaking superstitions to find tricks, daring to think and act to create, labor efficiency is new every day, working hard and skillfully, completing the 150-day task in 70 days."

    消灭肩挑人抬
    ——龙湾套水利工地大搞技术革新
    本报记者　姜涛
    踏进山东泗水县龙湾套水利工地，就到处听到马达声和轱辘马声交织在一起，放眼望去，展现在眼前的是一个别开生面的新场面：二万二千多名水利建设大军，有秩序地驾驶着自己创造和改制的新式工具奔驰在规模壮阔的工地上。满载黄土的轱辘马斗车往返如梭，动力牵引的斗车从坝底下徐徐地爬到了十三米高的坝顶，人力滑车牵引的胶轮车你上我下的来回着，土制的吊杆不断地把装满土的筐一个个吊在斗车上，拖拉机来回地碾压着已经铺好了的新土层。
    龙湾套水库坝长三百米、坝高二十九米，蓄水一亿多公方，可灌溉农田二十四万亩，是泗水县最大的骨干工程之一。它的第一期工程是在1958年11月中旬开工，当时由于工具改革抓的不够，工效不高，六千多名劳力干了七个月才完成工程总任务的39.4％，大部分工程要在今冬完成。水库的大坝越筑越高，运土越来越远，劳动量相对的加重，再加上工具缺乏，劳力不足，时间又短，要完成这个任务就越来越艰巨。中共泗水县委为了解决这个问题，决定发动群众进行技术改革。可是由于部分领导干部存在保守思想，不相信群众的智慧，因此技术改革在前些时候一直搞不起来。例如运到工地上的六千七百多米铁轨，只由几个技术人员去铺，十二天才铺了九百二十米，按这样的速度需要两个月才能铺完；就是已经铺上的轨道也是弯弯曲曲，高低不平，谁都不愿使用。
    工地党委在县委的帮助下，总结了运动没有搞起来的经验教训，一方面从上到下、从党内到党外深入地进行了社会主义教育，展开了要不要进行工具改革和依靠谁来改革等问题的鸣放辩论，彻底批判了形形色色的保守思想。接着，广大群众在“向工具要劳力，以工具争时间”的口号下，人人动脑筋，个个献计策，开展了轰轰烈烈的工具改革运动。另方面又召开了老农、干部、技术员相结合的现场会议，对已铺上而不能使用的铁轨道进行了“会诊”，采取边操作，边找原因，边研究，边修理，并固定专人专车，人车编号的操作法后，很快就推广了铁轨运土法，比过去肩挑人抬轻快多了。群众发动起来了，三昼夜就铺铁轨道五千四百多米。金庄民工团由书记孟传喜同志带头，大家动手，三个多小时铺铁轨道四百八十米，技术改革由落后一跃变为先进单位。现在工地上大批铁轮斗车奔驰在十三条长达六千多米的铁轨道上。
    工具改革的好处又不断地鼓舞着广大群众的信心，不到十天的时间，群众提出的合理化建议达三百多件。根据群众提出的合理化建议，已经试验成功和大量推广使用的有滑车牵引爬坡器、铁轨转盘、渡车、双轨循环操作器、石制羊角碾、自动装土器等十余种，共一千多件，这些工具一般提高工效几倍到几十倍。县机械厂技术革新能手朱庆修等四人，用四十五马力的煤气机改制了一台小火车头，一次能拖带十五个斗车，每天工作十小时，能运土一百多方，可代替一百个劳动力。群众创造的立式动力牵引爬坡器在二十八米长坡度相当大的轨道上，每次牵引一千多斤，每二十秒钟就能牵引一次，比人工提高工效二十多倍。采用炸药破土，最多一次可爆破五百多方，比人工提高工效七十多倍。现在这个工地已实现了爬坡动力牵引化、夯实碾压化、开石松土爆破化、运土轨道化等，基本消灭了肩挑人抬。
    随着工具改革的开展，先进工具的大量推广使用，大大节省了劳力，减轻了体力劳动。金庄民工团女民工赵业菊、乔芝荣说：过去两个人一天抬土二十五趟，合一点一方土，感到有些累；现在改推轱辘马，一天推五十八趟，合八方土，觉着很轻快。
    原来计划整个工程一百五十天完成，工具改革以后，预计可提前八十天完成。现在广大群众又提出：“围绕工程动脑筋，破除迷信找窍门，敢想敢干搞创造，劳动工效日日新，大干苦干加巧干，一百五十天任务七十天完成”的响亮口号。（附图片）
