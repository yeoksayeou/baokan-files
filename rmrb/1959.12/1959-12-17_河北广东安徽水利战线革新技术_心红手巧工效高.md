Xinhua News Agency Report: On the Hebei Province's broad mountainous areas, plains and low-lying regions, commune members are speeding up the construction of large, medium and small-scale reservoirs, canals, water and soil conservation, flood and waterlogging prevention, and comprehensive management projects such as depression transformation, the work of drilling wells has also been launched to form a province-wide winter water conservancy upsurge.

The scale of Hebei Province's water conservancy winter repair project is huge this year. Large reservoirs are currently under construction in the upper and middle reaches of the Tang River, Hutuo River, Zhang River, Fuyang River, Luan River, and Yongding River. Various mountainous areas have already constructed a large number of water and soil conservation projects such as horizontal trenches and fish scale pits, and newly built terraces alone amount to more than 2 million mu.

During construction, party organizations at all levels thoroughly mobilize the masses, carry out heart red and skilled, everyone creates, a hundred things innovation competition movement. The Wangkuai Reservoir's migrant workers skillfully used the winch to carry the soil truck, in the case of the dam is 30 meters high, to achieve each winch can transport 5 cubic meters of soil per minute. Xinle County Koutou Reservoir blasting expert Zhang Fu, after painstaking research, created the successful "five-strand drilling heart lying hole" blasting method, a one-time collapse of 10,300 cubic meters of stone, equivalent to 10,000 labor one day of quarrying capacity. Huai'an County Yanghe Canal migrant workers, according to this principle, created the "serial blasting frozen soil" method, a one-time collapse of 1,200 cubic meters of frozen soil. Many water conservancy sites due to vigorously engage in technological innovation, to achieve soil transport car, car rolling bearing, road rail, loading and unloading soil automation, have accelerated the construction progress.

Hebei Province this winter built farmland water conservancy projects, mainly relying on the people's communes to self-reliantly run, the state investment is very small. Many people's communes run factories themselves on construction sites, no tools to make themselves, no lime to burn themselves, no explosives to make themselves. Huai'an County manufactured and reformed more than 20 kinds of tools a total of 32,100 pieces, to solve the shortage of tools difficulties.

Xinhua News Agency Guangzhou, December 15th Electric: Guangdong Province winter water conservancy construction site migrant workers seize the loosening, loading, transporting, unloading, pressing and other five links, with tool reform as the center to carry out high efficiency activities.

This year, Guangdong Province winter water conservancy are mostly water storage projects, the construction of dikes workload is particularly large, generally have to go through five processes of loosening soil, loading soil, transporting soil, unloading soil, compaction. At present, most of the key projects have achieved soil loosening with blasting, soil loading with hoppers, soil transport with cars, automatic unloading methods, soil compaction with water immersion methods, so that these five processes are one after another, interlocking, work efficiency generally increased by one to several times.

Soil loosening blasting method, is to use explosives blasting instead of manual loosening or digging soil. Qingyuan County water conservancy construction site to take blasting soil loosening, an ordinary shot can loosen 1,000 to 5,000 cubic meters of soil, work efficiency increased several times to more than ten times. Huazhou County Guanqiao Commune Shuikou Reservoir construction site, after the party committee secretary and migrant workers together to study, the use of three shots fired in a row of new methods, each blasting with 125 pounds of explosives, can loosen 6,000 to 7,000 cubic meters of soil.

In order to transport the soil loosened by blasting on the high ground to the construction site, several bridge frames are erected on the high ground, and several hoppers are installed on the bridge deck, and the mud is pushed to the bridge deck and leaked into the soil transport vehicle through the hopper, which is the use of hoppers for soil loading and cars for soil transport. After the implementation of this method at the Leibei County Youth Canal construction site, the work efficiency increased by more than 10 times compared with manual soil loading.

The automatic unloading method is to transform the side panels or loose panels of the mud box installed on the car into movable flaps, so that the car can automatically unload the soil. Zhanjiang area counties vigorously promote the use of cars for soil transport and automatic unloading methods, according to different terrain and conditions, respectively, with handcarts, large flatbed trucks, cattle carts, wooden rail trains, grinding wheel winches, inclined sliding cars, round rolling soil transport vehicles and other more than 20 kinds of vehicles to transport soil, soil transport efficiency generally increased by two or three times.

Soil compaction with water immersion, is to divide the earth dam to be built into blocks, filling soil while watering, using water immersion to sink the soil, instead of ramming compaction. Using this method of dam construction, can also be constructed in rainy days, pressed quickly and solid, not only high efficiency, good quality, but also can greatly reduce the labor of ramming or using stone roller to press the soil. At present, 147 water conservancy construction sites in the province have adopted this method.

This newspaper Hefei, December 16th Electric: Anhui Province this winter in the vigorous development of water conservancy movement, make full use of mechanical power to control water, the province's average daily work efficiency of water conservancy construction, has increased from the beginning of the winter repair in early November of two cubic meters to more than seven cubic meters.

Now, the people's communes water conservancy construction sites in the province, has created the use of mechanical power instead of manual operation, including excavation, loading, transport, unloading and compaction, drainage and other processes. Such as in the excavation of soil, with tractors to loosen the soil; in the transport of soil, Suxian County Zhang Youdao and the famous peasant inventor Gong Peizhi with 3.5 horsepower gas engine to drive the pulley transport device, one person driving the machine operation and six people with the excavation of soil, in the transport distance of 25 meters, the daily work efficiency of 300 to 350 cubic meters, an average of 40 to 50 cubic meters per person. In terms of compaction, the Ma'anshan Reservoir construction site in Zongyang County used a tractor to drag the sheep's horn roller to compact the soil, which is equivalent to the work efficiency of 1,200 people operating 170 stone rollers. These places use mechanical power instead of manual operation, the work efficiency is generally one to ten times higher than manual, and the labor force is saved by half. (Attached picture)

    河北广东安徽水利战线革新技术
    心红手巧工效高
    据新华社讯　在河北省广大山区、平原和低洼地区的公社社员，正在加紧兴修大中小型水库、渠道、水土保持、防涝防洪、洼地改造等综合治理工程，凿打机井的工作也已展开，形成全省冬修水利的高潮。
    河北省今年水利冬修工程规模巨大。唐河、滹沱河、漳河、滏阳河、滦河、永定河等河流上中游目前正在兴修大型水库。各地山区已经兴修了大量的水平沟和鱼鳞坑等水土保持工程，仅新修的梯田就有二百多万亩。
    在施工中，各地党组织都深入发动群众，开展心红手巧、人人创造，百事革新的竞赛运动。王快水库的民工巧妙地运用卷扬机带土车，在大坝高三十多米的情况下，达到每部卷扬机一分钟可运土五立方米。新乐县口头水库爆破能手张福，经过苦心钻研，创造成功了“五股钻心卧洞”爆破法，一次崩石头一万零三百多立方米，相当一万个劳力一天的采石量。怀安县洋河大渠的民工，按照这个原理，创造“连珠爆破冻土”法，一次崩冻土一千二百多立方米。许多水利工地由于大搞技术革新，实现了运土车子化、车子滚珠轴承化、道路轨道化、装卸土自动化，都加快了施工进度。
      河北省今冬兴修的农田水利工程，主要是依靠人民公社自力更生兴办的，国家投资很少。许多人民公社在工地自办工厂，没有工具自己造，没有石灰自己烧，没有炸药自己作。怀安县制造、改革工具二十多种共三万二千一百多件，解决了工具不足的困难。
    据新华社广州15日电　广东省各冬修水利工地民工抓紧松、装、运、卸、压等五个环节，以工具改革为中心展开高工效活动。
    今年广东省冬修水利大都是蓄水工程，建筑堤坝的工作量特别多，一般都要经过松土、装土、运土、卸土、压实五个工序。目前，多数重点工程都做到了松土用爆破、装土用漏斗、运土用车子、卸土自动法、压土用水浸法，使这五个工序一环接一环，环环扣紧，工效普遍提高一倍到好几倍。
    松土爆破法，是用炸药爆破代替人工松土或挖土。清远县各水利工地采取爆破松土，普通一炮可以松土一千至五千立方米，工效提高几倍到十几倍。化州县官桥公社水口水库工地，经过党委书记和民工一道研究，采用三炮连发的新办法，每次爆破用炸药一百二十五斤，可以松土六七千立方米。
    为了把高地爆破松过的土运到工地，在高地架设若干个桥架，桥板上面装着若干个漏斗，把泥土推到桥板上，通过漏斗漏进运土车上，这就是装土用漏斗，运土用车子。雷北县青年运河各工地实行这种办法后，工效比用人工装土提高十多倍。
    卸土自动法，是把车子上装泥木箱的旁板或松板，改装成活动的翻板，车子就能够自动卸土。湛江专区各县都大力推广运土用车子和卸土自动法，根据不同的地形和条件，分别用手推车、大板车、牛拉车、木轨火车、磨轮绞车、斜坡滑车、圆滚式运土车等二十多种车子运土，运土效率普遍提高两、三倍以上。
    压土用水浸，是把要建筑的土坝分成块块，边填土边灌水，利用水浸来沉实泥土，代替打硪压实。利用这种方法筑坝，在雨天也可以施工，压得又快又实，不仅工效高，质量好，而且可以大大减少打硪或用石辘压土的劳动力。目前全省已有一百四十七处水利工地采用了这种方法。
    本报合肥16日电　安徽省今冬大兴水利运动中，充分利用机械动力治水，全省兴修水利的日平均工效，已由11月上旬冬修开始的二立方米增加到七立方米以上。
    现在，全省各人民公社的水利工地上，已创造用机械动力代替人力操作的，包括挖、装、运、卸和夯实、排水等各个工序。如在挖土方面，用拖拉机松土；在运土方面，宿县张友道和著名的农民发明家龚培芝用三点五马力煤气机带动滑车运土器，一人开机器操纵和六人配合挖装土，在运距二十五米的情况下，日工效达三百到三百五十立方米，平均每人四十至五十立方米。在夯实方面，枞阳县马鞍山水库工地用一部拖拉机拖羊角碾压土，相等于一千二百人操作一百七十盘石硪的工效。这些地方利用机械动力代替人力操作以后，工效普遍比人力提高一倍至十倍以上，而劳力节省了一半。（附图片）
    河北省磁县岳城水库拦洪坝工程采用机械和人力相结合的联合作业，人工垫一层土，然后用机械把它压实。
