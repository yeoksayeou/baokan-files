Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30th: Our correspondent reports: This year, the Soviet people will record in history their great achievements in communist construction. In this year, the national economic construction front of the Soviet Union has presented a myriad of new aspects, its economic strength has been further enhanced, and all economic sectors have achieved new and significant surges. The Soviet people have obtained inspiring achievements in realizing the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) and establishing the material and technical base of communism, and in the race against time to catch up with the United States.

　　1959 is the first year of the Soviet Union's implementation of its grand Seven-Year Plan. This year, the situation in all sectors of the Soviet national economy is very good, with industrial production completing plans ahead of schedule and exceeding targets every month and quarter. In the first eleven months, the total national industrial output value increased by 11.3% compared with the same period last year, overproducing products worth more than 40 billion rubles. Good news has also come from the transportation industry. The railway transportation sector alone will transport more than 50 million tons of goods above the plan by the end of the year. In terms of capital construction, this year's construction and installation plan has been completed more smoothly than in the past. On average, almost three newly built large-scale industrial enterprises were put into production every day throughout the country. Agricultural production has also achieved fruitful results. The total output of grain and other crops has exceeded the average level of the past five years, and cotton production, both in terms of total harvest and yield per unit area, has broken historical records. The growth rate of livestock products is very large. In the first eleven months, the national collective farms and state farms increased meat production by 32% compared with the same period last year, milk by 15%, eggs by 25%, and wool by 11%.

　　The central issue for the Soviet Union in building the material and technical base of communism and catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries economically is to continuously accelerate economic development and gain time. Since the beginning of this year, the Soviet national economy has continued to advance at a high speed. According to estimates in the Soviet press, the growth rate of total Soviet industrial output value for the whole year will be about 40% higher than the average annual growth rate stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan, and about 50% higher than the original target for this year, that is, 11%-12% higher than last year. This speed also exceeds the average annual growth rate of industrial output value in the past seven years, and it is the fastest growing year in the last four years. It is worth noting that the development speed of many key heavy industrial sectors has been further accelerated. For example, in the first nine months of this year, Soviet steel and pig iron production increased by 9% compared with the same period last year, while in 1957, the growth rates of these two products were 5% and 4% respectively, and in 1958 both were 7%. The petroleum, gas, and chemical industries are industrial sectors that the Soviet Union has particularly focused on developing in recent years to meet the needs of communist construction. Compared with the same period last year, in the first three quarters of this year, the output value of Soviet chemical industrial equipment increased by 50%, and oil and gas production increased by 14% and 24% respectively.

　　While heavy industry is developing rapidly, consumer goods industry and agricultural sectors are also advancing rapidly. The Seven-Year Plan originally stipulated that the consumer goods industry would grow by an average of 7.3% per year, while it is expected to grow by 10.5% this year. In the past five years, Soviet milk and meat production have grown by an average of 9.6% and 6.2% per year, respectively, while since the beginning of this year, the total national milk production has increased by 16%, and the growth rate of meat production is expected to be no less than 20%.

　　Due to the accelerated growth rate of production, the Soviet Union will obtain more products this year than originally planned. For example, steel production will not be the originally planned 59 million tons, but will reach 60.3 million tons; iron ore production will not be the originally planned 92.7 million tons, but may reach 94 million tons; electricity will not be 258 billion kilowatt-hours, but will reach 262.8 billion kilowatt-hours; and oil production will also be 2.7 million tons more than the original target.

　　The comprehensive surge of the Soviet national economy this year has further strengthened the Soviet Union's economic strength and enabled the Soviet Union to win new victories in the economic competition to surpass and catch up with the United States. As everyone knows, before this year, the Soviet Union had already surpassed the United States in the total output of industrial products such as coal, combine harvesters, woolen fabrics, peat, sugar, reinforced concrete, etc., and in important agricultural products such as wheat, sugar beets, flax, milk, wool, and animal fats. And this year, the Soviet Union has also overtaken the United States in the production of internal combustion locomotives and iron ore. In the first nine months of this year, the Soviet Union's iron ore production was 1.5 million tons more than the total output of the United States last year. In addition, this year the Soviet Union's per capita animal fat production has exceeded that of the United States, and milk is very close to the level of the United States.

　　In contrast to the rising situation of the Soviet economy, this year has been a year of basically stagnant industrial production and deepening agricultural crisis for the US economy. This year, the US industrial production index has fluctuated several times and is still roughly at the level of the end of 1956 to the beginning of 1957. Compared with the same period last year, the US industrial production index only increased by 3.1% in the first three quarters of this year. However, during this period, Soviet industrial production increased by 23%. According to materials published by US officials, although the United States will increase its oil and gas production this year, the growth rate is far lower than that of the Soviet Union, and this is still based on a large reduction in production last year. Although US steel production this year has increased by about 7 million tons compared with the economic crisis of 1958, it is still about 21 million tons less than in 1957. The production of some other products, such as coal and iron ore, will stagnate or even decrease; it is estimated that coal production will decrease from 405 million tons last year to just over 400 million tons. The agricultural situation in the United States this year is even worse. According to TASS, the US Department of Agriculture recently estimated the harvest volume of sixteen agricultural products this year, nine of which are significantly lower than last year.

　　The victorious implementation of the Soviet communist construction plan and the development of the economic comparison between the Soviet Union and the United States have further strengthened the overall situation of the East Wind continuing to prevail over the West Wind.

　　People's Daily, Moscow, December 30th: Correspondent Dai Feng reports: In these days of bidding farewell to the old year and ushering in the new year, the Soviet newspapers and radio stations have been continuously transmitting encouraging news: the tasks of the first year of the Seven-Year Plan for comprehensively launching communist construction are being completed ahead of schedule and exceeding targets.

　　While actively striving to overfulfill this year's various construction and production tasks, the people of the Soviet Union have begun to prepare for a major effort in the second year of the Seven-Year Plan. The 1960 Soviet National Economic Development Plan adopted by the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet at the end of October has excited the hearts of every Soviet person, and they are full of confidence and are ready to move towards greater victories next year.

　　The Soviet industry in the second year of the Seven-Year Plan will still focus on the development of heavy industry, and the focus of construction will still be in the eastern region. Metallurgy, chemical industry, fuel, machine manufacturing, etc., will all move forward on a larger scale than in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan.

　　The second year of the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that steel production will be 64.9 million tons, that is, from the planned increase of 4.1 million tons this year to 6 million tons; in order to accelerate the development of the metallurgical industry, investment in basic construction in the metallurgical industry in 1960 will increase by 11% compared with this year. In this year alone, there will be 160 metallurgical industrial construction projects with a cost of over 100 million rubles, and the new steel base construction projects in the eastern region will be fully started. At the same time, the output of pig iron, steel pipes, steel, etc., will also increase greatly this year. In order to ensure steel production, iron ore production will achieve unprecedented development next year. The increase in iron ore production will reach 31 million tons, which is equal to the total increase in iron ore production in the three years from 1956 to 1958.

　　The second year of the Seven-Year Plan attaches great importance to the development of the chemical industry. This year, investment in plastics and synthetic rubber has increased by 50%, and synthetic fibers by 20%.

　　Electricity production in the second year of the Seven-Year Plan will also be greatly developed. In 1960, the electricity plan will increase production by 11.2%.

　　In 1960, more than 400 new and important machines and equipment will be put into mass production, and more than 1,400 of the latest machine tools and equipment will be manufactured at the same time. Next year, investment in basic construction in machine manufacturing will increase by 30%. The latest scientific achievements will be used in machine manufacturing: electronic computing, semiconductors, supersonics, isotopes, etc.

　　The development of the fuel industry in the second year of the Seven-Year Plan will still focus on increasing the production of oil and gas. This year, oil production will increase by nearly 15 million tons, and gas production will increase by more than one-third. The east-west oil pipeline running across the entire Soviet Union will be laid to the eastern industrial center - Krasnoyarsk. The total length of the oil pipelines to be laid this year is 6,000 kilometers, and the gas transmission pipelines are more than 4,000 kilometers. The unified gas transmission system in the European region of the Soviet Union will be completed.

　　高奏凯歌辞旧岁　满怀信心迎新年
    苏联经济高速前进奔向新高峰
    在同美国进行的经济竞赛中赢得新的胜利
    新华社莫斯科30日电　本社记者报道：今年苏联人民将以共产主义建设的丰功伟绩载入史册。在这一年里，苏联国民经济建设战线上气象万千，经济力量进一步增强，各经济部门都获得了新的巨大的高涨。在实现七年计划（1959—1965年）和建立共产主义物质技术基础方面，在争取时间猛追美国方面，苏联人民都获得了鼓舞人心的成就。
    1959年是苏联执行宏伟的七年计划的第一年。今年苏联各国民经济部门的形势非常良好，工业生产都是月月、季季提前和超额完成计划。在头十一个月中，全国工业总产值比去年同期增加了11.3％，超额生产了价值四百多亿卢布的产品。在运输业中也不断传来捷报，单是铁路运输部门到年底就将超计划运输五千多万吨货物。在基本建设方面，今年的建筑安装计划完成得比过去顺利，在一年中全国平均每一天就差不多有三个新建的大型工业企业投入生产。农业生产也获得了丰硕的果实。谷物等农作物的总产量超过了过去五年的平均平水，棉花生产不论是总收获量还是单位面积产量，都突破了历史上的最高纪录。畜产品的增长速度十分巨大，在头十一个月内，全国集体农庄和国营农场的肉类产量比去年同期增加了32％，奶类——15％，蛋类——25％，羊毛——11％。
    苏联建设共产主义物质技术基础和在经济上赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家的中心问题，是不断加快经济发展速度和赢得时间。今年以来，苏联国民经济继续以高速度前进。据苏联报刊估计，今年全年苏联工业总产值增长速度将比七年计划规定的年平均增长速度高40％左右，比今年原订指标高50％左右，即比去年增长11％—12％。这样的速度也超过了过去七年工业产值的年平均增长速度，而是最近四年来发展最快的一年。值得注意的是，许多关键性的重工业部门的发展速度都进一步加快了。例如，在今年头九个月内，苏联钢和生铁产量都比去年同期增加了9％，而在1957年，这两种产品的增长率分别为5％和4％，1958年都是7％。石油、瓦斯和化学工业是苏联为适应共产主义建设需要而在最近几年内特别着重发展的工业部门。与去年同期比较，在今年头三季中，苏联化学工业设备的产值增加了50％，石油和瓦斯产量分别增加了14％和24％。
    和重工业高速发展同时，消费品工业和农业各部门也在快步前进。七年计划原规定消费品工业每年平均增长7.3％，而今年预计将增长10.5％。过去五年，苏联牛奶和肉类生产每年平均分别增长9.6％和6.2％，而今年以来，全国牛奶总产量已增加了16％，肉类生产的增长率预计不会低于20％。
    由于生产增长速度的加快，苏联在今年将获得比原计划更多的产品。例如，钢产量将不是原计划的五千九百万吨，而将达到六千零三十万吨；铁矿砂产量将不是原计划的九千二百七十万吨，而可能达到九千四百万吨；电力将不是二千五百八十亿度，而将达到二千六百二十八亿度；石油产量也将比原定指标多二百七十万吨。
    今年苏联国民经济的全面高涨，进一步加强了苏联的经济力量，并使苏联在超美、赶美的经济竞赛中赢得了新的胜利。大家知道，在今年以前，苏联在煤、联合机、毛织品、泥炭、糖、钢筋混凝土等工业产品以及小麦、甜菜、亚麻、牛奶、羊毛、动物油脂等重要农产品的总产量上，已经超过了美国。而在今年，苏联又在内燃机车和铁矿砂的产量上赶过了美国。今年头九个月，苏联铁矿砂的产量比美国去年全国的产量还多一百五十万吨。此外，今年苏联按人口平均计算的动物油脂产量已超过了美国，牛奶则十分接近美国的水平。
    和苏联经济节节上升的情况相反，今年对美国的经济来说，却是工业生产基本上停滞不前、农业危机加深的年头。今年美国的工业生产指数曾几起几伏，目前仍大致处在1956年年底到1957年年初的水平上。与前年同期比较，今年头三季度美国工业生产指数只增加了3.1％。但是，在这个时期内，苏联工业生产却增加了23％。根据美国官方发表的材料，今年美国的石油和瓦斯，虽将增加一些，但增长速度却远远低于苏联，而且，这还是在去年大大减产的基础上增加的。美国今年的钢产量虽然比经济危机的1958年增加约七百万吨，但却比1957年约少二千一百万吨。另外一些产品，如煤和铁矿砂产量则将停滞不前甚至减产；预计煤产量将从去年的四亿零五百万吨减少到仅仅比四亿吨多一点。美国今年的农业情况更为不妙。据塔斯社报道，美国农业部最近估计了今年十六种农产品的收获量，其中有九种大大低于去年。
    苏联共产主义建设计划的胜利执行，以及苏联和美国经济对比的发展情况，进一步加强了东风继续压倒西风的总的形势。
    本报莫斯科30日电　记者戴枫报道，在这将辞旧岁迎新年的日子里，苏联每天的报纸和广播电台接连地传出了令人鼓舞的捷音：全面展开共产主义建设的七年计划第一年的任务，在提前和超额完成着。
    苏联各地人民在积极努力超额完成今年的各项建设生产任务的同时，已着手准备在七年计划第二年大干一番。10月底，苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议所通过的1960年苏联发展国民经济计划，激动着每一个苏联人的心，他们满怀信心，预备在明年走向更大的胜利。
    七年计划第二年的苏联工业，仍然以发展重工业为中心，建设重点仍在东部地区。冶金、化学、燃料、机器制造业等，都将以比七年计划第一年更大的规模向前发展。
    七年计划第二年规定钢的生产量为六千四百九十万吨，即从今年计划的增产量四百一十万吨增至六百万吨；为了加速冶金工业的发展，1960年用于冶金工业基本建设的投资比今年增加了11％。这一年里仅是造价达一亿卢布以上的冶金工业建设工程就达一百六十个，东部地区新建的钢铁基地工程都要全面兴工。同时，这一年的生铁、钢管、钢材等产量也将有很大增加。为了保证钢铁生产，明年铁矿砂的产量将获得前所未有的大发展。铁矿砂增产量将达三千一百万吨，这等于1956—1958年三年间铁矿砂增产的总和。
    七年计划第二年对化学工业发展给予了极大重视。这一年用于塑料和合成橡胶的投资增加了50％，合成纤维增加20％。
    七年计划第二年的电力生产也将得到巨大发展。1960年电力计划将增产11.2％。
    1960年将有四百多种新的重要机器装备成批生产，同时还要制造出一千四百多种最新式的机床与设备。明年用于机器制造业基本建设方面的投资将增加30％。机器制造业中将运用最新科学成就：电子计算学、半导体、超音速、同位素等。
    七年计划第二年燃料工业的发展仍然以增产石油、瓦斯为主。这一年里石油将增产近一千五百万吨，瓦斯将增产三分之一以上。横贯全苏的东西大油管将铺设到东部工业中心——克拉斯诺雅尔斯克。这一年要铺设的输油管全长六千公里，瓦斯输送管为四千多公里。苏联欧洲地区的统一瓦斯输送系统将要建成。
