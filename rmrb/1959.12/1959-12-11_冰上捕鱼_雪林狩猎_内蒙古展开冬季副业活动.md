Xinhua News Agency Report: Currently, the lakes on the Inner Mongolian grasslands have successively frozen over, and the peak season for ice fishing has arrived. The Dalai Lake Fishing Farm cast its winter nets in the second half of November and began harvesting plump, fresh fish.

Many communes in the Ik Zhao League and Bayannur League have established specialized winter fishing teams, actively fishing for various types of fish in the Yellow River basin and local lakes and reservoirs.

Another report: The golden season for hunting wild animals in Inner Mongolia has arrived. Hunters of the Oroqen, Ewenki, and Daur ethnic groups in the Hulunbuir League, together with Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen, have launched a winter hunting competition. In the vast forest, they are both protecting the forest from fire and hunting wild animals, striving to produce more fur and meat this winter and next spring, while also capturing a batch of live deer and elk to establish animal farms. The amateur hunting team of employees of the Dobukuer Forestry Bureau has already hunted back the first batch of roe deer and wild boars from the deep mountains and dense forests.

People of all ethnic groups in the Bayannur League, located in the Helan Mountains area, have also been vigorously carrying out hunting production recently, despite the severe cold. The seventeen fishing and hunting teams of various rural communes in Wuyuan County have already hunted 279 foxes and wild rabbits, and caught more than 50,000 jin of fish. Hunters on the Xilin Gol grassland have already sold thousands of gazelles they have hunted to food companies. (Attached picture)

    冰上捕鱼　雪林狩猎
    内蒙古展开冬季副业活动
    据新华社讯目前，内蒙古草原上的湖水先后封冻，冰上捕鱼旺季已经到来。达赉湖渔场从11月下半月撒开冬网，开始捕捞肥美鲜鱼。
    伊克昭盟、巴彦淖尔盟许多公社纷纷建立冬季捕鱼专业队伍，在黄河流域和当地湖泊、水库里积极捕捞各种鱼类。
    又讯　内蒙古捕打野生动物的黄金季节到来了。呼伦贝尔盟鄂伦春、鄂温克、达斡尔等族猎人，同蒙汉农牧民一起，发起冬季打猎竞赛。在千里林海中，他们一面护林防火，一面猎捕野生动物，争取在今冬明春生产更多的兽皮和兽肉，同时捕捉一批活鹿、活犴，举办养兽场。多布库尔林业局职工业余狩猎队，已从深山密林猎回第一批狍子和野猪。
    位于贺兰山地带的巴彦淖尔盟各族人民，最近也不顾严寒，大力开展狩猎生产。五原县各农村公社的十七个渔猎队，已经猎获狐狸和野兔二百七十九只，捕鱼五万多斤。锡林郭勒草原上的猎人们，已经把猎获的数千只黄羊卖给了食品公司。（附图片）
