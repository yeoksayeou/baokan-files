    Grasp the Forest Products Chemical Industry
    The forest products chemical industry is an emerging industry in our country. Its products, such as fiberboard, tannin extract, activated carbon, rosin, essential oils, synthetic petroleum, and alcohol, play important roles in industrial and agricultural production and construction, and are indispensable for people's lives. With the development of socialist construction and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, forest products chemistry is becoming increasingly important. The fundamental way to develop the forest products chemical industry is to comprehensively utilize timber. Currently, we feel that timber is insufficient on the one hand, and the utilization rate of timber is very low on the other, only 40%, while the Soviet Union is 70%. The reason for the low utilization rate is the failure to implement comprehensive utilization. According to surveys, when timber is harvested in various parts of our province, branches and leaves remaining on the mountains account for 30%; after timber is harvested, the wood chips, wood, and bark discarded after lumbering account for another 20%. Therefore, only half of the timber is actually utilized, and the other half is abandoned on the mountains or in timber processing plants. Taking the province's annual timber felling volume of four million cubic meters as an example, two million cubic meters can be used as raw materials for forest products chemistry. If comprehensively utilized, 600,000 tons of fiberboard can be produced. In addition, many essential oils, activated carbon, gasoline, alcohol, artificial cotton, paper pulp, etc., can also be made. Implementing the comprehensive utilization of timber can not only solve many industrial raw materials but also change the current situation of timber shortage. Therefore, it is necessary to promote it vigorously, especially the use of waste materials to manufacture fiberboard and paper, which is of great and urgent significance for saving timber. Taking fiberboard as an example, in the same place, only one cubic meter of fiberboard is needed, while four cubic meters of lumber are needed, and the production of four cubic meters of lumber requires 5.7 cubic meters of logs. Therefore, one cubic meter (ie, one ton) of fiberboard can replace 5.7 cubic meters of logs. As mentioned above, if 600,000 cubic meters of fiberboard are produced annually, it is equivalent to an increase of more than three million cubic meters of timber.
    Comprehensive utilization of timber and vigorous development of forest products chemistry are highly advantageous in this province. Because the province is rich in forest resources, not only can the existing forest reserves be used for long-term harvesting, but there are also more than 1,200 kinds of wild plants that can be used to manufacture fibers, tannins, oils, starches, and medicines; moreover, due to the mild climate, long growing season of plants, and rapid forest land renewal, this is the material basis for ensuring a continuous supply of raw materials for the forest products chemical industry. Establishing forest products chemical plants requires less investment, lower costs, quick results, and high returns, and the technology is not very complex. Therefore, vigorously developing forest products chemistry can be widely promoted. All communes with logging tasks can develop it, and state-owned logging farms can develop it even more.
    To develop the forest products chemical industry, it is necessary to implement the policy of walking on two legs and vigorously launch mass movements. That is: combine large, medium, and small, with medium and small as the main focus; combine indigenous and foreign methods, starting from indigenous methods to foreign methods; starting from scratch, from small to large; vigorously develop "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups". Generally speaking, communes (or production brigades) should vigorously develop "small indigenous groups", while state-owned logging farms can vigorously develop "small foreign groups"; as for the construction of "medium foreign groups" and "large foreign groups", it can be carried out gradually when conditions are met. When building factories, all localities should consider raw materials and transportation conditions. Locate the factories within the logging yards to achieve "on-site material acquisition and on-site production"; also, adapt to local conditions, and engage in multiple productions if possible, and produce one or two kinds of products if only one or two kinds of products can be produced. Do not demand uniformity or perfection. Only in this way can we quickly form mass movements, achieve widespread development, and achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Forest products chemistry is an emerging industry. Any new thing will encounter some difficulties at the beginning, but as long as we are determined to do it, the difficulties can be overcome. (Excerpted from Fujian Daily)

### 抓林产化学工业

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    抓林产化学工业
    林产化学工业是我国的一项新兴工业，它的产品如纤维板、栲胶、活性炭、松香、芳香油、人造石油、酒精等，在工农业生产建设上都起着重要的作用，也是人民生活所不可缺少的。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，和人民生活的不断提高，林产化工越来越显得重要了。发展林产化工的
  根本途径，是综合利用木材。目前我们一方面感到木材不足，另一方面木材利用率又很低，只不过40％，而苏联是70％。利用率低的原因是没有实行综合利用。据调查，我省各地木材采伐时，残存在山上的树枝、树叶占30％；木材采伐下来，经过制材后，丢弃的木屑、木头、树皮又占了20％。因此实际上木材只利用了一半，其余一半是遗弃在山上或木材加工厂内。以本省年伐木量四百万立方米计，就有二百万立方米可资作林产化工的原料，如果加以综合利用，就可以生产六十万吨纤维板。此外，也可制成许多芳香油、活性炭、汽油、酒精、人造棉、纸浆等。实行木材的综合利用，不但可以解决许多工业原料，同时也可改变木材不足的现状。因此必须大搞特搞，特别是利用废材制造纤维板和纸张，对于节约木材具有十分迫切的意义。以纤维板来说，同一个地方，用纤维板只要一立方米，如用板材就要四立方米，而制四立方米板材需要五点七立方米原木。因此，一立方米（即一吨）的纤维板可代替五点七立方米的原木使用。像上面所说，如年产六十万立方米纤维板，就无异增加了三百多万立方米的木材。
    综合利用木材，大兴林产化工，在本省是有十分优越的条件的。因为本省森林资源丰富，不仅现有的林木积蓄量可供长期采伐利用，还有一千二百多种可以制造纤维、单宁、油料、淀粉和药品的野生植物；而且由于气候温和，植物的生长期长，林地更新快，这是保证林产化学工业原料永续不断的物质基础。建立林产化工厂，投资少，成本低，收效快，收益大，而技术又并不怎样复杂。因此大搞林产化工是可以普遍推广的，凡是有伐木任务的公社都可以发展，国营伐木场更可以发展。
    发展林产化工必须贯彻两条腿走路的方针，大搞群众运动。那就是：大中小结合，中小为主；土洋结合，由土到洋；从无到有，从小到大；大搞“小土群”、“小洋群”。一般说来，公社（或生产大队）要大搞“小土群”，国营伐木场则可以大搞“小洋群”；至于“中洋群”、“大洋群”的建设，在条件具备的情况下，可以逐步进行。各地在建厂时要考虑到原料和交通运输条件。把工厂设在采伐场内，作到“就地取材，就地生产”；还要因地制宜，能搞多种生产就搞多种生产，只能生产一两种产品就生产一两种产品，不要强求一致，十全十美。只有这样，才能迅速形成群众运动，作到遍地开花，实现多快好省。
    林产化工是一项新兴的工业。任何新生事物开始都会碰到一些困难，但是只要下决心干，困难就一定能够克服。　（摘自福建日报）
