　　Lao Zhao and I

　　This day I was on the night shift, and I arrived at the factory early. As soon as I entered the steel casting workshop, Branch Secretary Zhao from the large component section greeted me and said, "Master Wen, I have good news for you. Today we are going to carry out technical matching..." Before Branch Secretary Zhao could finish speaking, I interjected and asked, "What do you mean by matching?" Branch Secretary Zhao smiled and said, "It means taking individual, scattered techniques and summarizing them into complete sets of experiences, helping each other, and improving together. What do you think?" I said, "Great, I must study hard." Just as we were talking, Secretary Li walked over and immediately challenged me, "Old fellow, it's not just 'studying,' you have to be the lead in this play. As an old worker, you must show your skills!" My face turned red, "Okay, let's match several sets!" Afterwards, I went to listen to the report. I was listening intently when suddenly I felt a punch in the back; I turned around and saw my old comrade-in-arms, Master Zhao Shijia. His face was full of smiles, and he immediately challenged me, "How about it, brother? Let's have a competition!" I couldn't lose this challenge, so I said, "Okay, I'll do it!"...

　　That night, I lay in bed, my mind racing, and I remembered the suffering I endured as a 15-year-old apprentice in the old society. Now the Party has nurtured me, my work is valued by the leaders and loved by everyone, and this year I even attended the city's advanced producer conference. As I thought about it, Secretary Zhao's words echoed in my ears. I couldn't calm down any longer, so I got out of bed. Who knew that this would wake up my "better half"? "Oh dear! Why aren't you sleeping in the middle of the night? What are you doing?" I explained the situation, and she understood, encouraging me, "We can't fall behind! You go ahead! I'll get the lamp ready for you!" Wow, I didn't expect her to challenge me too, so I put on a coat and started drawing under the lamp.

　　The next day at work, wow, as soon as I entered, there was a cacophony of gongs and drums. The conference room of the steel casting workshop was decorated in colorful ribbons; a horizontal plaque above the door read "3, 6, 9 Market" in golden letters. There were things like "Retail Department" and "General Store." It was truly dazzling. I was just about to ask how many sets Master Zhao had contributed when Secretary Li rushed over to ask me how many I had brought. I said, "Twenty sets." Secretary Li shook my hand and congratulated me. At this moment, Lao Zhao also congratulated me: "Good, you're ahead of me, but just wait until next time!"

　　Yesterday I heard that Lao Zhao had already matched twenty-five sets, so after work, I went home and thought and drew again. Lao Zhao heard this, and when he got home, he started drawing under the lamp too.

　　Now, if you ask me who is ahead, that's a tough question. Let's see what happens at the second "market." In any case, we've got each other fired up! To be honest, our technical "matching" is really great! Not only did I receive an ideological education and learn a lot, but it's also beneficial for improving everyone's technical skills. I will definitely contribute all of my experience.

### 我和老赵

　　我和老赵
    这天我上夜班，提前来到厂里，一进铸钢车间，大型工段赵支书就迎上前来对我说：“温师傅，告诉你件好事，今天要搞技术配套……”没等赵支书说完，我插嘴问道：“什么叫配套？”赵支书笑着说：“就是把个人分散的技术拿出来，总结成成套的经验，互相帮助，共同提高，你看怎样？”我说：“好呵，我得好好学习学习。”正说着，栗书记走过来了，见面就将了我一军：“老伙计，不是学习学习，这台戏你得作主角呵，老工人嘛，可要多显身手呵！”我脸一红：“好，多配几套！”随后就听报告去了。正听得入神，突然背后挨了一拳；回头看去，是我的老战友——赵世家赵师傅。他满脸堆着笑，又当场将了我一军：“怎样，兄弟？咱俩比量比量吧！”这一军，我可不能服输了，便说：“好吧，我跟你干！”……
    晚上我躺在床上脑子里翻来复去，把旧社会我十五岁入厂学徒所受的苦楚都想起来了。如今党培养了我，工作上受到领导的重视和大家的爱戴，今年还出席了市的先进生产者会议。想着，想着，赵书记的话又响在我的耳边。我再也不能平静下去了，便从被窝里爬起来。谁知这下子惊动了咱“屋里的”，“唉呀！深更半夜的不睡觉，干啥呀！”我把道理一说明，她也开了窍，便鼓励我说：“咱们可不能落后！你干吧！我给你准备灯！”好家伙，我没想到她也将了我一军，于是披件衣服，在灯光下画开了。
    第二天上班，嗬，一进门，锣鼓喧天，只见铸钢车间会议室装饰得花花绿绿；门前一块横匾写着：“三、六、九集”四个金字。什么“门市部”啦，“杂货店”啦。真是眼花缭乱。刚想打听一下赵师傅献多少套？栗书记就赶来问我拿来多少。我说：“二十套。”栗书记一听，就向我握手祝贺。这时老赵也向我祝贺：“好啊，你跑在我前头了，下次瞧吧！”
    昨天听说老赵已经配了二十五套，下班后，回家又想又画。老赵一听说，回到家里也在灯光下画起来了。
    现在，你叫我说咱俩谁占先，这就难住我了，看第二次“赶集”吧，不管怎样，反正咱俩算叫上劲来了！说句老实话，咱们开展的技术“配套”真好！不仅我受了一次思想教育，学到了不少东西，对提高大家的技术水平，都有好处。我一定把自己的全部经验拿出来。
