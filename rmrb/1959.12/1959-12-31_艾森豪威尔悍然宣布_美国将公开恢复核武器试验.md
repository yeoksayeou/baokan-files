Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: Washington dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower has refused to extend the U.S. moratorium on nuclear weapons testing, which expires at the end of this year. In a statement on the 29th, he announced that the U.S. "voluntary cessation of (nuclear weapons) testing will expire on December 31st," and that "we (the U.S.) consider ourselves free to resume nuclear weapons testing."

　　Eisenhower made this announcement after holding a high-level decision-making meeting at his vacation headquarters in Augusta, Georgia. Those attending the meeting included Secretary of State Herter, Secretary of Defense Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining, Chairman of the Government Atomic Energy Commission McCone, and senior officials from the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency.

　　Eisenhower also said that during the so-called U.S. "voluntary cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the United States will continue to implement its active program of research, development, and laboratory-form experimentation with weapons." He said that the United States "will not do so without prior announcement of our intention to resume nuclear weapons testing."

　　Eisenhower also said in the statement that "negotiations on the cessation of nuclear testing have now been going on for fourteen months, and there is still no sign of a satisfactory agreement." However, Eisenhower evaded the responsibility for the numerous obstacles that the United States has consistently set for the negotiations, and attempted to shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union, saying that at the Geneva Three-Nation Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests, Soviet experts "were unwilling to give serious scientific study to the effectiveness of seismic techniques for detecting underground explosions," thereby "damaging the prospects for an agreement" and "darkening the atmosphere of the negotiations."

　　The United States was forced to announce a one-year moratorium on nuclear weapons testing last August under public pressure after the Soviet Union took the initiative to announce a halt to nuclear weapons testing. The moratorium was due to expire on October 31st of this year, and after its expiration, it was announced that it would be extended to the end of this year.

　　艾森豪威尔悍然宣布
    美国将公开恢复核武器试验
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔拒绝延长到今年年底期满的美国暂停试验核武器的期限。他在29日的声明中宣布美国“自愿停止（核武器）试验的期限将于12月31日满期”，“我们（美国）认为我们自己有恢复核武器试验的自由”。
    艾森豪威尔是在他的休假总部佐治亚州的奥古斯大城举行高级决策会议以后作了这一宣布的。参加这次会议的有国务卿赫脱、国防部长盖茨、参谋长联席会议主席特文宁、政府原子能委员会主席麦康以及国务院、国防部和中央情报局的高级官员。
    艾森豪威尔又说，在所谓美国
  “自愿停止核武器试验期间，美国将继续执行它的研究、发展和以试验室形式实验武器的积极计划”。他说，美国“不会不事先宣布我们打算恢复核武器试验就这样做”。
    艾森豪威尔在声明中还说，“有关停止核试验的谈判到现在已经进行了十四个月，还看不出能达成圆满的协议。”但是，艾森豪威尔回避美国一贯为谈判设置重重障碍的责任，企图把责任推给苏联，说什么在日内瓦三国不继续试验核武器的会议上，苏联专家“不愿意对侦察地下爆炸的地震技术的效果给以认真的科学研究”，因而使“协议的前景受到了损害”，“使谈判的气氛变得阴暗起来”。
    美国是在苏联主动宣布停止核武器试验后，在去年8月在舆论压力下被迫宣布停止核武器试验一年。停止期到今年10月31日届满、届满后又宣布延长到今年年底。
