    Further Strengthen the Leadership Role of Party Organizations in People's Communes

    I
    People's communes are new social organizations developed on the basis of advanced agricultural production cooperatives. They are the inevitable product of China's political and economic development, and were created by China's hundreds of millions of peasants to meet the needs of the development of productive forces. Precisely because of this, people's communes have demonstrated their vigorous vitality and unparalleled superiority in just over a year.

    Lenin said: "We must study the new shoots with the utmost care, treat them with the greatest attention, and do everything possible to help them grow." Our Party has adopted such an attitude towards people's communes, this new social organization. When the vital seedling of the people's commune had just emerged on the horizon, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party made correct provisions on the nature and future of the people's commune, the steps to be taken to establish it, and relevant policy issues at its enlarged meeting in Beidaihe in August 1958. Subsequently, in November 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong, at a meeting in Zhengzhou attended by some central leaders and some local leaders, discussed the issue of rectifying people's communes. Subsequently, at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and at the enlarged meeting of the Central Political Bureau held in Zhengzhou in February and March 1959, a series of important decisions were made on the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes. According to these decisions, Party organizations in various localities launched a large-scale commune rectification movement starting in the winter of 1958. After rectification, the people's communes firmly established themselves and rapidly embarked on a path of consolidation and healthy development. At the same time, all parts of the country closely combined the commune rectification movement with Party rectification work, and achieved great success. This Party rectification work, combined with commune rectification, was extensive, the masses were fully mobilized, the combination of top and bottom was good, and the problems were solved relatively deeply and thoroughly. Party members and cadres received a very profound and practical socialist and communist education. They have a further understanding of the boundaries between capitalism and socialism, the differences and connections between the socialist and communist stages, the nature of the people's communes, and some of the economic laws of socialism. Through commune and Party rectification, the ideological style of Party members and cadres has been effectively improved, the Party's grassroots organizations and cadre ranks have been purified, and the leadership level of the commune Party organizations has been greatly improved. The situation in the countryside is now very good. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, various localities launched an anti-rightist, energizing, and vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy. The vast number of Party members, cadres, and the masses are more spirited, full of energy, and confidently striving to overfulfill this year's production plan.

    Currently, a deep-going socialist education movement is underway in rural areas across the country, combined with further commune and Party rectification work. Through this commune and Party rectification, further strengthening the leadership role of Party organizations in people's communes is an important task in current rural work.

    The experience of Party rectification in the past year has proven that the work of rectifying the Party's grassroots organizations and cadre ranks must permeate the entire process of commune rectification. The main contents of commune and Party rectification are consistent. Party rectification must be closely centered on solving the main problems existing in the commune. In the process of rectification, holding meetings of cadres at several levels by the province and county, holding Party congresses and members' representative meetings in the communes, and holding Party member meetings and members' meetings in the production teams can ensure that commune and Party rectification combines top and bottom, combines Party members and non-Party members, mobilizes at all levels, deepens step by step, and exposes and solves problems deeply and thoroughly. At the same time, specific requirements should be put forward for Party organizations and Party members, consciously exposing and solving problems existing within the Party, and improving the Party's leadership system and organizational life. This will not only solve the key problems within the Party and the commune, but also consolidate the achievements of commune rectification. Commune and Party rectification must be closely integrated, but the two should not be completely mixed together. In the process of rectification, if Party organizational construction work is not consciously carried out, not only will the internal problems of the Party not be well resolved, but the results of commune rectification will not be consolidated.

    Past experience in Party rectification has also proven that the process of Party rectification is the process of educating and improving Party members and cadres. Ideological and political work should run through the entire Party rectification work. In Party rectification, it is necessary to educate Party members and cadres, explain the principles clearly, point out the direction, so that they can draw a clear line between right and wrong on major principled issues, and solve the main problems existing in their ideological style. In Party rectification work, on the one hand, attention should be paid to commending good people and good deeds, protecting and promoting the enthusiasm of the vast number of Party members and cadres; on the other hand, for a small number of bad people and bad deeds and those who have committed serious mistakes, serious criticism and handling should be carried out. In this way, right and wrong can be distinguished, good and bad can be distinguished, role models can be established, the advanced can become more advanced, those with shortcomings and mistakes can easily correct them, and bad people can be punished as they deserve, and all Party members and cadres can be educated. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the vast number of Party members and cadres be truly protected and promoted.

    Focusing on rectifying and transforming a small number of backward branches is an important part of Party rectification work. Local experience has proven that in order to rectify backward branches, it is necessary to specifically analyze the reasons for their backwardness and take different measures according to different situations. For those branches that are lagging behind in their work and have weak leading backbones, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of educating and improving them, and make necessary adjustments to the leading backbones of the branches. For individual branches whose leadership is controlled by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, it is necessary to send capable cadres, fully mobilize the masses, clean out the counter-revolutionaries and various bad elements who have infiltrated the Party, and select those activists who are loyal to the interests of the people and the cause of socialism and communism to take on leadership positions. After rectification, after the main problems of the backward branches have been resolved, it is also necessary to provide specific assistance and leadership for a long period of time, and carry out a series of political and ideological work and organizational work in order to completely change their backwardness.

    We must absorb these beneficial experiences from the past and combine them with the current commune rectification movement to do a better job in Party rectification work. At the same time, through commune and Party rectification, further improve the leadership methods of the commune Party committees, strengthen the core leadership role of the branches, and improve the leadership level of the commune cadres.

    II
    When the Party committee of a people's commune leads the work of the commune, it must grasp both politics and economics; it must do a good job in both production and life; it must grasp the center and take care of other aspects, so that all aspects of work can be carried out in a planned manner, integrated with each other, promote each other, and achieve comprehensive development and a comprehensive leap forward. To do this, it is necessary to continuously improve the leadership methods of the commune Party committees through commune and Party rectification.

    The Party's mass line is the fundamental method for carrying out all our work. Without the mass line, without the high tide of revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and without the vigorous mass movement, the consolidation and development of the people's communes would be impossible. However, if we do not adhere to putting politics in command and do not give full play to the Party's leadership role in all work, it is impossible to correctly implement the Party's mass line and launch a mass movement. When the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in the countryside has not yet been finally and thoroughly resolved, if proletarian ideology does not take command, bourgeois ideology will inevitably take command. Only by strengthening the Party's leadership role, only by constantly strengthening political and ideological work, and carrying out socialist and communist education for the vast number of cadres and the masses, can we adhere to the political direction of the proletariat, correctly implement the Party's mass line, and truly mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the millions of masses, so that they can consciously participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    The Party's general line and the Party's policies and guidelines are the embodiment of the will of the broad masses, represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses, and are the soul of implementing the mass line. The vast majority of commune cadres are able to faithfully implement the Party's general line and policies in their work. However, there are also a small number of commune cadres who have varying degrees of right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions. They only one-sidedly emphasize some of the immediate and partial interests of the masses, so that they deviate from the Party's policies and guidelines. Their thinking lags behind the level of awareness of the masses, and it is impossible for them to lead the masses to advance victoriously. They lack vigilance against some wealthy peasants with serious capitalist spontaneous tendencies, and are influenced by them. Through this movement, we should hold the banner of the Party's general line even higher, thoroughly oppose rightism, and boost our energy. It is necessary to educate the cadres to correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, to correctly handle the temporary interests and long-term interests, and to overcome the individualism and departmentalism of some cadres. In particular, it is necessary to educate the cadres to correctly understand the situation of class struggle in the countryside, to further draw a clear line between the socialist and capitalist roads, and to overcome the capitalist spontaneous tendencies of a small number of wealthy peasants. At the same time, there are also a small number of cadres who, when implementing the Party's policies and resolutions, do not combine being responsible to the higher authorities with being responsible to the masses, but separate them. They are not good at carrying out their work in combination with the specific conditions of their regions and the actual situation of the masses. This approach is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, and therefore it is impossible to correctly implement the Party's policies and guidelines. It is necessary to educate the cadres to understand the unity of the Party's interests and the interests of the masses, to combine being responsible to the higher authorities with being responsible to the masses, and to combine the Party's policies and resolutions with the specific conditions of their regions. When commune cadres specifically implement the Party's policies and resolutions, they must study and understand the essence of the policies and resolutions, conduct serious investigations and research, and listen to the opinions of the masses. And according to the actual situation of their regions, they should put forward practical and feasible methods and measures, and carry out extensive and in-depth publicity, turning the Party's policies and resolutions into conscious actions of the masses. This is the Party's working method of the mass line of "concentrating, persisting."

    Since the Great Leap Forward, the Party's working method of the mass line has been greatly developed in rural work, and has accumulated rich experience. Such as the great airing of views, big-character posters, great debates, consulting with the members on everything, jointly deciding, jointly implementing, jointly responsible; cadres cultivating experimental fields and the combination of cadres, peasants, and technicians to improve production technology and create high-yield experience; holding on-the-spot meetings, organizing visits, holding exhibitions, conducting evaluations, and so on. At the same time, a set of systems for contacting the masses and obtaining mass supervision has also been established. For example: (1) Regularly hold Party congresses and members' representative meetings of the commune; the commune, production brigade, and production team regularly report their work to the members' representative meetings, representative meetings, and members' meetings, and listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses. The election of grassroots cadres should fully promote democracy so that the masses can elect cadres they truly support. (2) According to the needs of the work, hold meetings of cadres at several levels with the participation of professional groups, production teams, production teams, and production brigade cadres in a planned manner to convey and discuss the Party's policies and summarize work experience. (3) Hold seminars for old peasants, middle-aged people, and young activists in a planned manner to discuss and study important issues in production technology. (4) Cadres often go down, engage in typical experiments, conduct investigations and research, listen to the opinions and reflections of the masses, and modify their plans and measures according to the opinions of the masses. All of these are effective methods and systems for combining leadership and the masses, combining politics and economics, and combining technical theory and production practice, and must be adhered to in the future, and new experiences must be continuously created and accumulated in practice.

    According to the fundamental principle of democratic centralism, the Party committee of the people's commune should implement a system of combining collective leadership and individual responsibility. This is also a specific application of the mass line method in the Party's leadership work. Collective leadership and individual responsibility are a unity of opposites, and neither is indispensable. It is wrong to talk about collective leadership without talking about individual responsibility, or to talk about individual responsibility without talking about collective leadership. The members of the Party committee of the commune should include outstanding Party members from all aspects in order to concentrate opinions from all aspects and make the Party committee a leading core with knowledge in all aspects and close ties with the masses. The Party committee must conscientiously implement the principle of democratic centralism, and the meetings of the Party committee should be institutionalized. All major issues in the work must be seriously discussed by the Party committee collectively and jointly decided. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the secretary and members should have appropriate divisions of labor so that all aspects of the Party committee's work have someone responsible. There are roughly two types of division of labor: one is line leadership, that is, dividing battle lines according to the different businesses of the commune, and assigning someone to be responsible for each aspect of the work; the other is division of responsibility by area, with the secretary and members dividing up areas and going to production brigades or production teams to carry out central work. Both of these divisions of labor are necessary. If there is only division of responsibility by area and no line leadership, it is easy to neglect departmental work; if there is only line leadership and no division of responsibility by area, it will affect central work. The correct approach should be to combine division of responsibility by area with line leadership and to combine central work with departmental work. There are already many good experiences in this regard in various localities. These experiences can be summarized as: When the Party committee plans the work for each stage, it must arrange both central work and departmental work at the same time. It is necessary to highlight the central work and put the departmental work in an appropriate position. The Party committee members who are responsible for the work of each battle line should lead the departments to formulate plans to serve the central work, so that the business work of each department revolves around the central work. When Party committee members divide up areas and go down to work, they must do a good job in both central work and departmental work; they must pay attention to cultivating grassroots cadres and giving play to the role of grassroots organizations, and must not take over everything. In this way, the Party committee of the commune can truly combine the unified leadership and unified organization of the Party committee with the business guidance of each department and give play to the role of various organizations, and can also twist the forces of all aspects into one rope, ensuring the completion of the Party's central tasks and ensuring the regular work of each department.

    To fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, it is also necessary to give full play to the role of various non-Party organizations under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee.

    The Party is the advanced force of the working class and the highest form of class organization of the working class. The Party must lead everything and is also able to lead everything. All non-Party organizations can do a good job only if they conscientiously implement the Party's line, principles, and policies under the unified leadership of the Party, so as not to lose their direction. In some communes, some people, under various pretexts, one-sidedly emphasize the "independent" activities of their systems and the special role of their departments, and do not obey the unified leadership of the commune Party committee. This kind of thinking and action is extremely wrong. Of course, this is by no means to say that the Party can take over the daily affairs of non-Party organizations and confuse the principled differences between the Communist Party and all non-Party organizations; if so, it would turn the Party into a general mass and economic organization and reduce the role of the Party as the vanguard of the proletariat.

    In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over the commune and do a good job in all aspects of the commune's work, it is necessary to give full play to the role of the commune management committee. If the Party and the commune's working bodies are completely merged and the role of the management committee is not brought into play, the Party committee will inevitably be forced to handle a large number of specific economic and administrative affairs, and cannot study major policy issues, which will inevitably weaken the Party's leadership and political and ideological work. Therefore, in the process of commune and Party rectification, attention should be paid to improving the organization of the commune management committee and conscientiously leading and helping the management committee to establish its own regular work. Many tasks in the commune, such as business work related to production, distribution, food, finance, culture and education, and other administrative work of the original district and township governments, should be done by the management committee. The Party committee should regularly inspect the work of the management committee and help solve the difficulties in the work.

    The Communist Youth League is the Party's powerful assistant and one of the Party's links with the masses. The commune Party committee must enable the rural Youth League organizations to fully play this role, strengthen political and ideological work among young people, and truly become the Party's tool for uniting and educating young people. The Party committee must also attach importance to women's organizations and give full play to their role among women.

    III
    The Party branch of the production team or production brigade is the rural fighting fortress and the basic link between the Party and the members. Only by relying on the branch can all the Party's guidelines and policies be specifically implemented among the masses, and only by doing a good job in the branch's work can the broad masses be united around the Party, better complete the commune's production plan and work tasks, and timely reflect the opinions and requirements of the masses to the higher-level Party organization, so that the leadership and the masses can be closely combined.

    The fundamental task of the Party branch in the commune is to improve the political awareness of the masses, highly promote the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses in building socialism, lead the masses to develop production quickly, well, and economically, and gradually improve the people's lives on the basis of increased production, so as to continuously consolidate and develop the people's commune. How to achieve this task? In the final analysis, it requires all branches to work in accordance with the principles stipulated in the Party Constitution. The branch must, in conjunction with the local actual situation, ensure the correct implementation of the Party's general line and policies and resolutions; discuss and decide on major issues in production, distribution, and life in the unit according to the Party's policies and the instructions of the higher-level Party organization; understand and study the thoughts, emotions, and requirements of the masses, reflect them to the higher authorities, and conduct political and ideological education among the masses. That is to say, the branch must not only attach importance to the Party's organizational construction, but also attach importance to the Party's ideological construction, establish the regular work of managing and educating Party members; it must grasp both production and life, and shoulder the responsibility of organizing and leading the production and life of the masses.

    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the work of rural branches has become more lively and active, and the methods of activity have been greatly developed, further improving the combat role of Party branches. These experiences are mainly that, according to the principle that the Party is the highest form of class organization, the branch should uniformly plan and arrange all tasks of the production team. Various organizations of the production team, such as the team committee, the Communist Youth League, women's and militia organizations, etc., must carry out their work under the unified leadership of the Party branch. When the branch carries out activities, it should, according to the actual situation, distinguish the priorities and urgencies, and adopt flexible methods, combining the methods of "first within the Party, then outside the Party" and "all-inclusive." Sometimes the working method of "first within the Party, then outside the Party" is adopted, that is, first discussing the Party's policies within the Party, unifying understanding, and improving thinking, so that the Party organization and Party members clearly understand how to play a role in the work, and then going to the masses to implement them. Sometimes a method of mobilizing both within and outside the Party can be adopted, so that Party members and the masses can discuss and study the Party's policies and work tasks together, and put forward specific requirements for Party members. The adoption of these working methods can not only convey the Party's policies and resolutions to the masses, but also give play to the exemplary and backbone role of Party members.

    To improve the Party's organizational life and strengthen the management and education of Party members is the fundamental guarantee for making the thinking within the Party consistent, strengthening the Party spirit of Party members, boosting the revolutionary enthusiasm of Party members, and continuously improving the ideological awareness and policy level of Party members. All branches should convene branch member meetings, branch committee meetings, and group meetings on schedule in accordance with the principles stipulated in the Party Constitution. At these meetings, not only should work be arranged and inspected, but also the Party's policies should be carefully studied, the emotions and reflections of the masses should be discussed, thoughts should be exchanged with each other, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out to continuously overcome shortcomings and mistakes. All rural Party members should study the Party's policies and resolutions, study the basic knowledge of the Party, and study agricultural production knowledge. Those who are illiterate should learn to read and write and remove the hat of illiteracy. Party members should become models of learning. At present, emphasis should be placed on educating Party members on the Party's general line and on the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. The night Party schools, red-and-expert schools, short-term Party training classes, and regular Party lessons adopted by various localities in the past are all effective methods for educating and improving Party members, and they must be adhered to in the future.

    Strengthening the work on non-Party activists is an important link in giving play to the branch's leadership role over the masses. Activists are the bridge between the Party and the masses and the backbone of the mass movement of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Party branch should not only cultivate activists for the purpose of developing new Party members, but should regard this work as an important method of uniting and leading the broad masses. The Party branch should pay attention to discovering activists in this commune and Party rectification movement and various movements, strengthen their education, unite them around the branch, and, on the basis of commune and Party rectification, systematically absorb some activists who meet the requirements for Party membership into the Party to strengthen the Party's organization.

    IV
    The cadres of the people's commune are the largest cadre force of the Party. They are closely connected with the members, directly reflect the emotions and requirements of the masses, are the direct organizers and leaders of the rural people, and are the direct implementers of the Party's general line and various policies and resolutions for socialist construction. To further manage and educate this cadre force through commune and Party rectification is of great significance for strengthening the Party's leadership over the people's commune and consolidating and improving the people's commune.

    Through continuous allocation, adjustment, and rectification, the commune's cadre force has been organized and grown, and the vast majority of communes have established a strong leadership core. Local experience has proven that the leadership members of the commune, production brigade, and production team must be active elements who resolutely implement the Party's general line, have production experience, are closely connected with the masses, and are loyal to the interests of the people and the cause of communism. Wherever such a leadership core has been formed, the Party's policies are smoothly implemented, the masses are fully mobilized, the work is carried out solidly and deeply, production is greatly increased, and all tasks are completed quickly and well. In the small number of places where such a leadership core has not yet been formed, especially in places where the main leading cadres are right-leaning and conservative, lack a mass viewpoint, and lack production knowledge, the Party's policies are not easily implemented correctly, the enthusiasm of the masses cannot be truly mobilized, and production and various tasks are not done well.

    Our Party has always relied on cadres who have been tested by mass movements and practical work, who have both ability and integrity, and who are both red and expert, as the leadership backbone. In the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, and in the commune and Party rectification movement, various localities have selected many such excellent cadres. However, in some places, when selecting and using cadres, not enough attention was paid to comprehensively examining the cadres' moral and talent conditions in essence. They sometimes regarded some people with unstable positions, insufficient motivation, and who stuck to the rules, and even those who were seriously right-leaning, as "good cadres" and gave them important positions. In some places, there are still a considerable number of cadres who are not competent for their current positions. Since the commune and Party rectification in the winter of 1958, most places have paid attention to these problems and further adjusted the leadership components at all levels of the commune. Only a very small number of places have not yet had time to make adjustments. In this commune and Party rectification movement, the vast number of cadres should receive a profound class education and consciously correct some of their shortcomings. For those right opportunists and those who are seriously right-leaning and resist the Party's policies, they should be resolutely removed from their leading positions, and at the same time, they should be patiently educated and strive for them to correct their mistakes. In the rural grassroots organizations, the Party's class line should be resolutely implemented, and the leading advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants should be established. Cadres with wealthy middle peasant backgrounds should not, in principle, hold major leadership positions in production brigades and production teams. At the same time, truly excellent elements with good backgrounds, high awareness, strong motivation, loyalty to the Party, firm positions, close ties with the masses, fairness, and knowledge of production should be adjusted and selected to leading positions.

    It is necessary to strengthen the training and education of cadres at all levels of the commune and continuously improve their ideological and political level and business work ability. For cadres at all levels of the commune, on the one hand, political, cultural, and business education should be strengthened in a planned manner; on the other hand, they should be regularly and consciously helped to exercise and improve in practical work and mass movements.

    For the political, cultural, and business education of commune cadres, a combination of off-the-job training and on-the-job learning should be adopted. The cadres at all levels of the commune should be trained in rotation in a planned, phased, and continuous manner. The training method should mainly be short-term in order to accelerate the improvement of cadres and adapt to the needs of the work. In the past, the Party schools, cadre schools, and training classes of various levels of agencies above the county level have achieved great success and accumulated rich experience in rotating and training commune cadres, and they should continue to be run well. A system of spare-time learning for cadres should be established and improved. In the process of commune and Party rectification, cadre red-and-expert schools, night Party schools, and various spare-time schools should be rectified and improved. A variety of ways should be used for learning, the contradiction between learning and work of commune cadres should be properly resolved, a certain amount of time should be arranged, and learning of on-the-job cadres should be guaranteed, so that they can develop the habit of learning.

    Whether it is off-the-job training or spare-time learning, it is necessary to educate cadres with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, with the aim of establishing a proletarian worldview and profoundly understanding the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. All cadres should study the Party's policies and resolutions around the mass movement and central work of each period. They should also study the methods of thinking and working, study the basic knowledge of the Party, and study the basic knowledge of agricultural science and the practical experience of agricultural production. Cadres with low cultural levels should also earnestly study culture. The main leading cadres of the commune should learn a little philosophy and a little political economy. The learning method must adhere to the principle of linking theory with practice.

    In practical work and mass movements, we must always pay attention to putting politics in command, combining the virtual and the real. When holding meetings to discuss work, we must not only earnestly study and solve the practical problems in the work, but also earnestly study the Party's policy issues, the issues of thinking methods and working methods. When arranging work, we must not only explain the tasks, but also explain the policies and the methods. In the work, we must give full play to the initiative, creativity, and initiative of the cadres. The use of cadres should be both tight and open. On policy and principle issues and key issues, it should be grasped tightly in order to unify understanding, unify action, and ensure the realization of the Party's policy principles. In practical work, it should be open, and they should be boldly let them go to work, so that they dare to take responsibility, and can take the initiative and consciously combine the Party's policy principles with the actual conditions of the local area, and complete the work tasks in a realistic manner, thereby cultivating and improving their ability to work independently. When inspecting and summarizing the work, the problems and experiences and lessons existing in the work should be raised to the level of theory and policy principles for analysis and research, and the working methods and thinking methods should be linked together for analysis and research. In this way, not only can the practical problems in the work be solved, but also the level of cadres can be improved.

    There are many ways to cultivate and improve cadres in practical work. In addition to the above-mentioned points, other methods such as provincial, county, and commune-level cadre meetings, on-site meetings to exchange advanced experiences, improving organizational life, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, cadres participating in physical labor, and cadres cultivating experimental fields are also effective methods for cultivating and improving cadres and should be paid attention to and well used.

    Finally, it should be emphasized that this commune and Party rectification movement is the most profound and practical exercise and test for Party organizations and every Party member and cadre at all levels of the commune. We should strengthen the leadership of this movement and place the work of studying and improving the work of the Party's grassroots organizations and rectifying and improving the commune cadres in an important position. We must earnestly absorb the rich experience in the Party's ideological construction and organizational construction in the past, and through this commune and Party rectification movement, further improve the working methods of the Party organizations of the people's communes and improve the leadership level of cadres at all levels of the commune. Only in this way can the leadership role of the Party organizations of the people's communes be further strengthened. Only in this way can the great task of agricultural modernization in our country be realized as soon as possible under the brilliant light of the Party's general line.

    进一步加强人民公社党组织的领导作用
    安子文
    一
    人民公社是在高级农业生产合作社的基础上发展起来的新的社会组织。它是我国政治和经济发展的必然产物，是我国几亿农民群众为着适应生产力发展的需要而创造出来的。正因为这样，人民公社在短短一年多的时间中，就显示出了它的旺盛的生命力和无比的优越性。
    列宁说过：“我们应当缜密地研究新的幼芽，极仔细地对待它们，尽力帮助它们成长”。（注）我们的党，正是采取这样的态度来对待人民公社这个新的社会组织的。当人民公社这个富有生命力的幼芽刚刚冒出地平线的时候，1958年8月党中央政治局在北戴河召开的扩大会议上，就对人民公社的性质、前途、建立公社所应当采取的步骤和有关政策问题，作出了正确的规定。接着，1958年11月毛泽东同志在郑州召开的有部分中央领导同志和部分地方领导同志参加的会议上，讨论了整顿人民公社的问题。随后，在党的八届六中全会上和1959年2、3月间在郑州召开的中央政治局扩大会议上，对于整顿和巩固人民公社都作出了一系列重要的决定。各地党组织根据这些决定，从1958年冬季起，开展了大规模的整社运动。经过整顿，人民公社扎实地站稳了脚跟，迅速地走上了巩固而又健康的发展道路。与此同时，全国各地都紧紧地结合着整社运动，进行了整党工作，并且取得了伟大的成绩。这次结合整社进行整党的工作，声势浩大，群众发动得充分，上下结合得好，问题解决得比较深透。党员和干部都受了一次很深刻、很实际的社会主义和共产主义教育。他们对资本主义和社会主义的界限，对社会主义阶段和共产主义阶段的区别和联系，对人民公社的性质和社会主义的一些经济规律，都有了进一步的认识。经过整社整党，有效地改进了党员和干部的思想作风，纯洁了党的基层组织和干部队伍，大大提高了公社党组织的领导水平。现在农村的形势很好。在党的八届八中全会以后，各地开展了反右倾、鼓干劲和轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，广大的党员、干部和群众，更加精神奋发，干劲十足，满怀信心地为超额完成今年的生产计划而奋斗。
    目前，全国各地农村正在进行一次深入的社会主义教育运动，结合着这个教育运动进一步进行整社和整党的工作。通过这次整社整党，进一步加强人民公社党组织的领导作用，是当前农村工作的一项重要任务。
    近一年来整党的经验证明：整顿党的基层组织和干部队伍的工作，必须渗透在整社的整个过程中。整社和整党的主要内容是一致的。整党必须紧密围绕着解决公社中存在的主要问题来进行。在整顿的过程中，由省、县召开几级干部会议，公社召开党代表大会和社员代表大会，生产队召开党员大会和社员大会等，就能使整社整党做到上下结合，党内外结合，层层发动，逐步深入，问题暴露得深，解决得透。同时，还要对党组织和党员提出具体要求，有意识地揭发和解决党内存在的问题，健全党的领导制度和组织生活。这样就不仅能解决党内、社内的关键问题，而且也能加强党的建设工作。整社整党必须密切结合，但是二者又不能完全混同起来。在整顿的过程中，如果不有意识地进行党的组织建设工作，不仅党内问题得不到很好解决，而且整社的成果也不能够巩固。
    过去整党的经验也证明：整党的过程，就是教育提高党员、干部的过程。思想政治工作应贯彻整个整党工作的始终。在整党中，要对党员、干部进行教育，讲清道理，指出方向，使他们在重大原则问题上，划清大是大非的界限，并且解决他们在思想作风方面存在的主要问题。在整党工作中，一方面要注意表扬好人好事，保护和发扬广大党员、干部的积极性；另一方面，对于少数坏人坏事和犯有严重错误的人，要严肃地进行批判和处理。这样，才能分清是非，区别好坏，树立榜样，使先进的更加先进，使有缺点、错误的人易于改正，使坏人受到应有的惩处，并且使所有的党员、干部都受到教育。也只有这样，才能真正地保护和发扬广大党员、干部的积极性。
    着重整顿和改造少数落后支部，是整党工作的一个重要环节。各地经验证明，整顿落后支部，必须具体分析形成落后的原因，针对不同情况，采取不同的措施。对于那些工作落后、领导骨干过弱的支部，必须坚持教育提高的方针，并对支部领导骨干进行必要的调整。对于个别的被地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子掌握领导权的支部，必须派出得力干部，充分发动群众，把混进党内的反革命分子和各种坏分子清洗出去，选拔那些忠于人民利益和社会主义、共产主义事业的积极分子担任领导职务。经过整顿，在落后支部的主要问题解决以后，还必须进行较长时期的具体帮助和领导，进行一系列的政治思想工作和组织工作，才能彻底改变落后面貌。
    我们必须吸取过去这些有益的经验，结合当前的整社运动，把整党工作做得更好。同时，通过整社整党，进一步改进公社党委的领导方法，加强支部的核心领导作用，提高公社干部的领导水平。
     二
    人民公社的党委在领导公社工作的时候，既要抓政治，又要抓经济；既要搞好生产，又要搞好生活；既要抓住中心，又要兼顾其他，使各方面的工作都有计划地进行，互相结合，互相推动，全面发展，全面跃进。要作到这样，就必须通过整社整党，不断地改进公社党委的领导方法。
    党的群众路线是我们进行一切工作的根本方法。没有群众路线，没有群众的革命积极性的高涨，没有轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动，人民公社的巩固和发展是不可能的。但是，如果不坚持政治挂帅，不在一切工作中充分发挥党的领导作用，要正确地执行党的群众路线，大搞群众运动也是不可能的。在农村社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争还没有最后彻底解决的时候，如果无产阶级思想不挂帅，资产阶级思想就必然挂帅。只有加强党的领导作用，只有经常不断地加强政治思想工作，向广大干部和群众进行社会主义和共产主义教育，才能坚持无产阶级的政治方向，才能正确地执行党的群众路线，也才能真正调动起千百万群众的革命积极性，使他们自觉地参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    党的总路线、党的方针政策是广大群众意志的体现，它代表着广大群众的根本利益，是贯彻执行群众路线的灵魂。绝大多数公社干部都能够在自己的工作中忠诚地执行党的总路线和方针政策。但是也有少数公社干部存在着程度不同的右倾思想和右倾情绪，他们只是片面地强调群众的某些眼前的、局部的利益，以至离开了党的方针政策。他们的思想落后于群众的觉悟程度，不可能领导群众胜利前进。他们对一部分有严重资本主义自发倾向的富裕农民缺乏警惕，受了他们的影响。通过这次运动，我们应当更高地举起党的总路线的旗帜，把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足。要教育干部摆正国家、集体和个人的关系，摆正暂时利益和长远利益的关系，克服某些干部的个人主义、本位主义思想。特别是要教育干部正确认识农村阶级斗争的形势，进一步划清社会主义和资本主义两条道路的界限，克服少数富裕农民的资本主义自发倾向。同时，也有少数干部在贯彻执行党的政策和决议的时候，不是把对上级负责和对群众负责结合起来，而是使之分割开来。他们不善于结合本地区的具体条件和群众的实际情况进行工作。这种作法是脱离群众、脱离实际的，因而也是不可能正确地贯彻党的方针政策的。要教育干部懂得党的利益和群众利益的一致性，把对上级负责和对群众负责结合起来，把党的政策、决议和本地区的具体情况结合起来。公社干部在具体贯彻执行党的政策、决议的时候，必须学习和领会政策、决议的精神实质，认真地进行调查研究，听取群众的意见。并且根据本地区的实际情况，提出切实可行的办法和措施，广泛深入地进行宣传，把党的政策、决议变成群众自觉的行动。这就是党的“集中起来，坚持下去”的群众路线的工作方法。
    大跃进以来，党的群众路线的工作方法，在农村工作中有了很大的发展，并且积累了丰富的经验。如大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论、遇事和社员共同商量，共同决定，共同执行，共同负责；干部种试验田和干部、农民、技术人员三结合，提高生产技术，创造丰产经验；召开现场会议，组织参观，举办展览，进行评比，等等。同时，也建立了一套联系群众和取得群众监督的制度。比如：（1）定期召开公社的党代表大会和社员代表大会；公社、生产大队和生产队定期向社员代表大会、代表会议和社员大会报告工作，听取群众的意见和批评。基层干部的选举，要充分发扬民主，使群众能够选上他们真正拥护的干部。（2）根据工作需要，有计划地召开有专业组、生产小队、生产队和生产大队干部参加的几级干部会议，传达讨论党的政策，总结工作经验。（3）有计划地召开老农、中年人和青年积极分子的座谈会，讨论和研究生产技术方面的重要问题。（4）干部经常下去，搞典型试验，进行调查研究，听取群众的意见和反映，并根据群众的意见修改自己的计划和措施。所有这些，都是领导和群众相结合、政治和经济相结合、技术理论和生产实践相结合的有效方法和制度，今后还必须坚持下去，并且在实践中不断创造和积累新的经验。
    根据民主集中制的根本原则，人民公社的党委应当实行集体领导和分工负责相结合的制度。这也是群众路线的方法在党的领导工作中的具体运用。集体领导和分工负责是对立的统一，两者缺一不可。单讲集体领导，不讲个人分工负责，或者单讲个人分工负责，不讲集体领导，都是错误的。公社党的委员会的成员应该包括各方面的优秀党员，以便集中各方面的意见，使党委会成为具有各方面知识、密切联系群众的领导核心。党委必须认真贯彻执行民主集中制的原则，党委会议应该形成制度，工作中的一切重大问题都要经过党委集体的认真的讨论，共同作出决定。在党委会的统一领导下，书记和委员应当有适当的分工，使党委各方面的工作都有专人负责。分工大体有两种：一是分线领导，就是按公社的不同业务，划分战线，每一方面的工作都责成专人负责；一是分片包干，书记和委员按地区分工，分头到生产大队或者生产队，进行中心工作。这两种分工，都是需要的。如果只有分片包干，没有分线领导，就容易忽略部门工作；如果只有分线领导，没有分片包干，就会影响中心工作。正确的做法应该是把分片包干和分线领导结合起来，把中心工作和部门工作结合起来。各地在这方面已有不少好的经验。这些经验，概括起来就是：党委在计划每一阶段工作的时候，要同时安排中心工作和部门工作。既要把中心工作突出，又要把部门工作摆在适当位置。分工负责各战线工作的党委委员，要领导各部门制定为中心工作服务的计划，使各部门的业务工作，围绕着中心工作来进行。党委委员分片包干下去工作的时候，既要做好中心工作，又要做好部门工作；既要注意培养基层干部，又要注意发挥基层组织的作用，不能包办代替。这样，公社党委才能够真正把党委的统一领导、统一组织力量和各部门的业务指导、发挥各种组织的作用结合起来，也才能够把各方面的力量拧成一股绳，既保证党的中心任务的完成，又保证各部门经常工作的进行。
    要充分调动广大群众的积极性，还必须在公社党委统一领导下，充分发挥各种非党组织的作用。
    党是工人阶级的先进部队，是工人阶级的阶级组织的最高形式。党必须领导一切，而且也能够领导一切。一切非党组织只有在党的统一领导下，认真地贯彻执行党的路线、方针和政策，才不致迷失方向，才有可能把工作做好。在某些公社中，有的人用各种借口，片面强调本系统的“独立”活动和本部门的特殊作用，不服从公社党委的统一领导，这种思想和行动是极其错误的。当然，这绝不是说，党可以包办非党组织的日常事务，混淆共产党同一切非党组织的原则区别；如果这样，就会把党变成一般群众的、经济的组织，降低党的无产阶级先锋队的作用。
    为了加强党对公社的领导，做好公社的各项工作，必须充分发挥公社管理委员会的作用。如果把党和公社的工作机构完全合并起来，不发挥管理委员会的作用，就必然迫使党委会去处理大量的具体的经济事务和行政事务，不能研究重大的方针政策问题，这样也就必然会削弱党的领导和政治思想工作。因此，在整社整党的过程中，应该注意健全公社管理委员会的组织，认真领导和帮助管理委员会建立自己的经常工作。公社中的许多工作，如有关生产、分配、粮食、财务、文化教育等方面的业务工作和原来区乡政权的其他行政工作等，都应该由管理委员会去做。党委应该对管理委员会的工作定期进行检查，帮助解决工作中的困难。
    共青团是党的有力助手，是党联系群众的纽带之一。公社党委必须使农村团的组织充分发挥这种作用，在青年中加强政治思想工作，真正成为党团结教育青年的工具。对于妇女组织，党委也必须重视，充分发挥它在妇女群众中的作用。
    三
    生产队或者生产大队的党支部是农村的战斗堡垒，是党直接联系社员群众的基本纽带。党的一切方针和政策，只有依靠支部，才能具体地贯彻到群众中去，也只有做好支部的工作，才能把广大群众团结在党的周围，更好地完成公社的生产计划和工作任务，并把群众的意见和要求及时地反映给上级党组织，使领导和群众密切地结合起来。
    公社中党支部的根本任务，就是要提高群众的政治觉悟，高度发扬群众建设社会主义的热情和积极性，领导群众多快好省地发展生产，并在生产提高的基础上逐步改善人民的生活，这样来不断地巩固和发展人民公社。如何实现这个任务呢？归根结底，就是要求一切支部，都必须按照党章规定的原则进行工作。支部必须结合当地实际情况，保证正确地贯彻执行党的总路线和政策、决议；根据党的方针政策和上级党组织的指示，讨论和决定本单位的生产、分配和生活中的重大问题；了解和研究群众的思想情绪和要求，向上级反映，并向群众进行政治思想教育工作。这就是说，支部既要重视党的组织建设，又要重视党的思想建设，把管理和教育党员的经常工作建立起来；既要抓生产，又要抓生活，担当起群众生产和生活的组织者和领导者的责任。
    1958年大跃进以来，农村支部工作更加生动、活泼，活动方法有了很大的发展，进一步提高了党支部的战斗作用。这些经验主要是，根据党是阶级组织最高形式的原则，支部要统一计划、统一安排生产队的各项工作。生产队的各种组织，如队委会、共青团、妇女和民兵组织等，都必须在党支部的统一领导下进行工作。支部在进行活动的时候，要根据实际情况，分别轻重缓急，采取灵活的方式，把“先党内后党外”和“一揽子”的方法结合起来。有时采取“先党内后党外”的工作方法，就是首先在党内讨论党的方针政策，统一认识，提高思想，使党的组织和党员明确认识在工作中怎样发挥作用，然后再到群众中去贯彻执行。有的时候可以采取党内、党外同时发动的方法，使党员和群众在一起讨论、研究党的政策和工作任务，并且对党员提出具体要求。采用这些工作方法，既能把党的政策、决议传达到群众中去，又能发挥党员的模范骨干作用。
    健全党的组织生活，加强对党员的管理教育，是使党内思想一致，加强党员的党性锻炼，鼓足党员的革命干劲，不断提高党员的思想觉悟和政策水平的根本保证。所有支部都应当按照党章规定的原则，按期召开支部党员大会、支委会和小组会。在这些会议上，不仅要布置检查工作，而且要认真研究党的政策，讨论群众的情绪和反映，互相交谈思想，开展批评和自我批评，不断克服缺点和错误。一切农村党员都要学习党的政策、决议，学习党的基本知识，学习农业生产知识。没有文化的，要学习文化，摘掉文盲帽子。党员应该成为学习的模范。在当前，应当着重对党员进行党的总路线的教育，进行社会主义同资本主义两条道路斗争的教育。过去各地采取的夜党校、红专学校、短期党训班、定期上党课等，都是教育和提高党员的有效方法，今后还必须坚持下去。
    加强对非党积极分子的工作，是发挥支部对群众的领导作用的一个重要环节。积极分子是党联系群众的桥梁，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的群众运动的骨干。党支部不应该仅仅为了发展新党员才去培养积极分子，而应该把这项工作，做为团结和带动广大群众的一项重要方法。党的支部应该注意在这次整社整党运动和各项运动中发现积极分子，加强对他们的教育，使他们团结在支部的周围，并在整社整党的基础上，有计划地把一些够党员条件的积极分子吸收到党内来，以壮大党的组织。
    四
    人民公社的干部，是党的一支数量最大的干部队伍。他们密切联系着社员群众，直接反映群众的情绪和要求，是农村人民群众的直接组织者和领导者，是党的社会主义建设总路线和各项政策、决议的直接执行者。通过整社整党，进一步管理好和教育好这一支干部队伍，对于加强党对人民公社的领导，巩固和提高人民公社，具有重大的意义。
    经过不断地配备、调整和整顿，公社的干部队伍已经组织和成长起来，绝大多数公社已经建立起坚强的领导核心。各地的经验证明：公社、生产大队、生产队三级的领导成员，必须是坚决贯彻执行党的总路线、有生产经验、密切联系群众、忠实于人民利益和共产主义事业的积极分子。凡是已经形成了这样的领导核心的地方，党的政策就贯彻得顺利，群众就发动得充分，工作就进行得踏实深入，生产就大大提高，各项任务就完成得又快又好。而在还没有形成这样的领导核心的少数地方，特别是主要领导干部右倾保守、缺乏群众观点、缺乏生产知识的地方，党的政策就不容易正确地贯彻下去，群众的积极性也就不能真正地调动起来，生产和各项工作就做得不好。
    我们党一贯依靠经过群众运动和实际工作考验的、德才兼备的、又红又专的干部，作为领导骨干。在大跃进和人民公社化运动中，在整社整党运动中，各地曾经选拔了很多这样的优秀干部。但是，也有一些地方，在选拔使用干部的时候，从本质上全面地考察干部的德才条件注意不够。他们有时把一些立场不稳、干劲不足、墨守成规的人，甚至严重右倾的人，当作“好干部”加以重用。有些地方，还有相当数量的干部不能胜任现职。自1958年冬季整社整党以来，大多数地方都已经注意了这些问题，进一步调整了公社各级的领导成份。只是极少数地方还没有来得及进行调整。在这一次整社整党运动中，应当使广大干部受到深刻的阶级教育，自觉地改正自己的某些缺点。对于那些右倾机会主义分子和严重右倾、抗拒党的政策的人，应当坚决地把他们从领导岗位上撤换下来，同时也要耐心地教育他们，争取他们改正自己的错误。在农村的基层组织中，应该坚决贯彻执行党的阶级路线，树立贫农、下中农的领导优势。富裕中农成份的干部，原则上不宜于在生产大队、生产队中担任主要领导职务。同时，应该把成份好、觉悟高、干劲足、对党忠实、立场坚定、密切联系群众、办事公道、有生产知识的真正优秀分子，调整和选拔到领导岗位上来。
    必须加强对公社各级干部的培养教育工作，不断提高他们的思想政治水平和业务工作能力。对于公社各级干部，一方面，应该有计划地加强政治、文化和业务的教育；另一方面，要经常地、有意识地在实际工作和群众运动中帮助他们锻炼和提高。
    对于公社干部的政治、文化和业务的教育，应该采取离职训练和在职学习相结合的办法。要有计划地、分期分批地、经常不断地轮训公社的各级干部。训练的方法，应该以短期为主，以便加速提高干部，适应工作的需要。过去县以上各级机关的党校、干校和训练班等，对于轮训公社干部曾取得巨大的成绩和丰富的经验，应当继续办好。要建立和健全干部的业余学习制度。在整社整党过程中，要把干部红专学校、夜党校和各种业余学校加以整顿和提高。要利用多种多样的方式进行学习，要妥善解决公社干部学习和工作的矛盾，安排一定的时间，保证在职干部的学习，使他们养成学习的习惯。
    无论离职训练或业余学习，都必须以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想教育干部，目的是要确立无产阶级的世界观，深刻地领会党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。所有干部都应该围绕每个时期的群众运动和中心工作学习党的政策、决议。都要学习思想方法和工作方法，学习党的基本知识，学习农业科学基本知识和农业生产的实际经验。文化低的干部，还应该认真学习文化。公社的主要领导干部，应该学点哲学，学点政治经济学。学习方法必须坚持理论联系实际的原则。
    在实际工作和群众运动中，必须时刻注意政治挂帅、虚实并举。开会讨论工作的时候，不仅要切实研究解决工作中的实际问题，而且要认真研究党的方针政策问题、思想方法和工作方法问题。布置工作的时候，不仅要交代任务，也要交代政策、交代方法。在工作中要充分发挥干部的积极性、创造性和主动性。对干部的使用，既要抓得紧，也要放得开。在政策原则问题上和关键问题上，要抓得紧，以便统一认识、统一行动，保证党的政策原则的实现。在实际工作中，要放得开，要大胆放手地让他们去工作，使他们敢于负责，能够主动地、自觉地把党的政策原则和当地的实际情况结合起来，实事求是地去完成工作任务，从而培养提高他们独立工作的能力。在检查总结工作的时候，要把工作中存在的问题和经验教训，提高到理论和政策原则上来分析研究，把工作方法和思想方法联系起来分析研究。这样作，既能解决工作中的实际问题，又能提高干部的水平。
    在实际工作中培养提高干部的办法是很多的，除上面所举的几点外，其他如省、县、公社召开几级干部会议；召开现场会议，交流先进经验；健全组织生活，开展批评和自我批评；干部参加体力劳动，干部种试验田等等，也都是培养、提高干部的有效方法，应该注意很好运用。
    最后应着重指出，这次整社整党运动，对于公社各级党组织和每个党员、干部，都是一次最深刻、最实际的锻炼和考验。我们应当加强对这一运动的领导，把研究和改进党的基层组织的工作和整顿提高公社干部的工作放在重要的地位。我们必须认真地吸取过去党的思想建设和组织建设上的丰富经验，并且通过这次整社整党运动，进一步改善人民公社党组织的工作方法，提高公社各级干部的领导水平。只有这样，才能进一步加强人民公社党组织的领导作用。也只有这样，才能在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，尽快地实现我国农业现代化的伟大任务。
