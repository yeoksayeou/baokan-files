　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 23rd: The Bulgarian News Agency reported on December 23rd that Todor Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, said in a recent interview with a reporter from the Greek newspaper "Dawn" stationed in Sofia that there are no rocket installations on Bulgarian territory. However, if such installations are built in our neighboring countries, we will, of course, have to draw appropriate conclusions from this.
    Zhivkov reiterated that the Bulgarian government and people unanimously welcome and most actively support the Soviet government's proposal to make the Balkan and Adriatic Sea region a zone free of atomic and rocket weapons, as well as the Romanian government's proposal to hold a summit conference of Balkan countries. Zhivkov said that the most vivid manifestation of Bulgaria's love of peace is the proposal recently made by its government to the Greek government to sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression between the two countries. However, the Greek government rejected this proposal without any grounds.
    Zhivkov then exposed a series of actions by the Greek ruling clique that continue to stubbornly implement the "Cold War" policy. Such as rejecting the proposal to establish a Balkan nuclear-free zone, starting to equip the Greek army with rocket weapons capable of launching nuclear warheads; seeking excuses to justify the policy of aggravating tensions in the Balkans; rejecting the proposal to hold a summit conference of Balkan countries, etc.
    Zhivkov expressed the hope that the obstacles to improving relations between Bulgaria and Greece would be eliminated as soon as possible, and put forward some specific proposals for strengthening the socio-economic and cultural ties between the two countries.

　　日夫科夫答希腊“黎明日报”记者问
    揭露希腊当局冷战行径
    希望尽快消除改善保希关系的障碍
    新华社索非亚23日电　据保加利亚通讯社23日报道：保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫，最近在答希腊“黎明日报”驻索非亚记者问时说，在保加利亚的领土上，没有火箭装置。但是，如果在我们的邻国建立这种装置的话，当然我们也将不得不由此作出适当的结论。
    日夫科夫再次表示，保加利亚政府和人民一致欢迎和最积极地支持苏联政府提出的关于使巴尔干和亚得里亚海区域成为无原子和火箭武器区的建议，以及罗马尼亚政府提出的关于举行巴尔干国家首脑会议的建议。日夫科夫说，保加利亚爱好和平的一个最鲜明的表现，是它的政府不久前向希腊政府提出的关于两国签订互不侵犯条约的建议。但是，希腊政府却毫无根据地拒绝了这一建议。
    日夫科夫接着揭露了希腊统治集团继续顽固执行“冷战”政策的一系列行径。如拒绝关于建立巴尔干无原子区的建议，开始用能发射原子弹头的火箭武器装备希腊军队；找寻借口为加剧巴尔干紧张局势的政策辩护；拒绝关于举行巴尔干国家首脑会议的建议等等。
    日夫科夫表示希望尽快消除改善保希两国关系的障碍，并提出了一些有关加强两国社会经济和文化联系的具体建议。
