    Wutun – Hometown of Tibetan Painters
    The Longwu River meanders from south to north through Tongren, the capital of the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province. On the east side of the river's middle reaches, there are two closely linked villages, known as Wutun, praised by the people as the hometown of Tibetan painters.
    Wutun has over three hundred Tibetan households. Most of the boys here begin learning painting from the age of eight or nine, receiving rigorous artistic training, and pursuing painting, sculpture, and other artistic activities as their profession. The paintings, patterns, sculptures, and other works of art they create appear realistic, vivid, and full of appeal, with a unique style that fully demonstrates the wisdom and creativity of the Tibetan people. These artworks are not only famous throughout Qinghai but are also loved by the people in Tibetan areas of Sichuan, Gansu, and Tibet. Currently, more than one hundred Tibetan painters from Wutun are engaged in painting and sculpture in Tibetan areas of Sichuan, Gansu, Tibet, and other places for extended periods.
    Since liberation, with the Party's care and strong support, Wutun's art has greatly developed and improved. Many outstanding Tibetan folk painters have been selected and sent to art schools at all levels for study and advanced training. This summer, Tibetan painters from Wutun, together with Han Chinese art workers from the Qinghai Provincial Mass Art Center, collected and compiled a large number of excellent Tibetan folk patterns and created many works reflecting the life and struggle of the Tibetan people. Eight serial paintings with the theme of contrasting the past and present life, and many patterns, were warmly welcomed and praised by the masses at the Qinghai Provincial Art Exhibition celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

    藏族画家之乡——五屯
    隆务河弯弯曲曲地从南往北流过青海省黄南藏族自治州的首府——同仁。河中游的东面，有着两个上下紧连的村庄，这就是被人民誉为藏族画家之乡的五屯。
    五屯共有藏族居民三百来户。这里的男孩子大多数从八、九岁起就开始学习绘画，受着严格的绘画训练，并以从事绘画、雕塑等美术活动作为自己的职业。他们创作出来的绘画、图案、雕塑等美术作品，看上去真实、生动而富于感染力，有着独特的风格，充分显示出藏族人民群众的智慧和创造性。这些美术作品不仅闻名于青海各地，而且为四川、甘肃等省的藏族地区和西藏等地的群众所喜爱。现在，还有一百多名五屯的藏族画家长期在四川、甘肃、西藏等地的藏族地区从事绘画和雕塑。
    解放后，五屯的美术在党的关怀和大力扶植下，有了很大的发展和提高。许多优秀的藏族民间画家被选送到各级艺术学校进行学习和深造。今年夏天，五屯的藏族画家和青海省群众艺术馆的汉族美术工作者一起，收集整理了大量的藏族民间优秀图案，创作了许多反映藏族人民生活和斗争的作品。以今昔生活对比为主题的八幅组画和许多图案，在青海省最近举办的庆祝建国十周年美术展览中，受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎和好评。
