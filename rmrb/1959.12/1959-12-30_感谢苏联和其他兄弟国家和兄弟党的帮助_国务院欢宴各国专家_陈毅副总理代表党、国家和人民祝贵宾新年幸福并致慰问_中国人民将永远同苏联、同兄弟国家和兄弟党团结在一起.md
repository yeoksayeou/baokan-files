Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: The State Council of the People's Republic of China held a grand banquet in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People tonight to entertain experts from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries and brotherly parties who have come to help our country in its construction, as well as their wives and children, to welcome the upcoming year of 1960.

Vice Premier Chen Yi delivered a warm speech at the banquet.

The grand banquet began at six o'clock. Among those present at the banquet tonight were Vice Premiers of the State Council Bo Yibo, Tan Zhenlin, Lu Dingyi, and Xi Zhongxun, as well as Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Zhen and Guo Moruo, and others.

Invited to attend the banquet were Antonov, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, Fomin, head of Soviet economic, cultural, and educational experts, experts from various brotherly countries and brotherly parties, as well as diplomatic officials from the embassies of various brotherly countries in China and their wives and children.

Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech was met with thunderous and warm applause from the entire audience. The full text of the speech is as follows: "Dear comrades:

Today, with boundless joy, we gather with experts from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries and brotherly parties to welcome the upcoming year of 1960. At this communist family-style gathering, I would like to first extend, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, warm congratulations and cordial greetings to all the experts and your wives and children.

The experts present today are all talents nurtured over a long period by the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries and brotherly parties who are both red and expert. Your people originally needed you to stay and work in your own countries, but in order to help our country in its construction, you have left your homes and come to our country. You have worked selflessly in our country, unreservedly imparted your advanced experience to our workers, and put forward many valuable work suggestions, making important contributions to our socialist construction. All of this fully embodies the high spirit of internationalism of the brotherly countries, brotherly parties, and all the experts. Here, on behalf of our Party, our government, and our people, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the expert comrades and, through you, to your parties, governments, and peoples.

In the past year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, holding high the banner of the general line for socialist construction, have continued to achieve a great leap forward in the national economy. Under the call and promotion of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, our people have launched a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy and in production and construction. Our people's communes have embarked on the road of consolidation and sound development, which has enabled us to overcome various obstacles on the road forward, complete the main targets of our country's Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and open up infinitely bright prospects for the continued leap forward of our people in the coming year and years to come. However, the Chinese people will never be satisfied with the achievements they have already made. The Chinese people deeply understand that the achievements they have made are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries and from the hard work of all the expert comrades. In order to strive for greater achievements, we will continue to modestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries and continue to seek advice from all the expert comrades.

Comrades, we are pleased to see that in the past year, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become more prosperous and consolidated. In particular, the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have achieved brilliant achievements in the construction of communism and amazing developments in science and technology, and have repeatedly made major efforts to safeguard the cause of peace. This vigorous development of the socialist camp has greatly strengthened the struggle of the people of the world for peace and against imperialism. In order to save their doom, the imperialists are trying everything possible to undermine the unity of the socialist countries. However, their conspiracies have been shamefully defeated in the past and will never succeed in the future. The Chinese people have always regarded safeguarding Sino-Soviet unity and safeguarding the unity of the socialist camp as their sacred international obligation. Under no circumstances will we ever separate from the Soviet Union and from all brotherly countries and brotherly parties. Today, this family-like gathering of ours is a symbol of the great unity of our proletarian internationalism. We firmly believe that in the coming year, our unity will be more consolidated, our cause will be more prosperous, and we will make greater contributions to the struggle for world peace and human progress.

Now, I propose a toast:

To the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,

To our greater achievements in the new year,

To the health and happiness of all the experts and your wives and children!"

Antonov, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Union in China, then delivered a warm speech, in which he thanked Comrade Chen Yi and all the Chinese comrades present at the banquet today on behalf of the Soviet Embassy in China and the Soviet experts, and thanked them for their congratulations to the Soviet Union and the Soviet experts and for their high evaluation. He congratulated the Chinese people on their New Year's happiness and proposed a toast to the eternal and indestructible friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China and the people of all countries in the socialist camp, and to the happiness and joy of the Chinese people.

Fomin, the head of the Soviet experts, spoke at the banquet, thanking the Chinese Communist Party and the government of the People's Republic of China on behalf of all the Soviet experts working in China. He said that 1959 was a year in which the Soviet and Chinese people achieved world-renowned great achievements. In this year, the entire socialist camp advanced victoriously along the road of socialism and communism. Looking back on 1959, we are pleased to see that new factories, mines, and power stations have been scattered across the land of our socialist countries.

Fomin said that we have personally witnessed the astonishing development and growth of China's new technical forces. We are particularly pleased to see that the Chinese people have prepared a huge technical force and reserve force for the construction in 1960 to meet the even more ambitious construction tasks.

Finally, Fomin said, as we rejoice with you for your great achievements, we wish you new and greater achievements in 1960.

All the speeches aroused bursts of warm applause from the entire audience.

Tonight, the heads of various government departments and Beijing Municipality attended the banquet, and they accompanied the guests in drinking and chatting. Famous Chinese actors performed many wonderful entertainment programs during the banquet.

After the banquet, a grand get-together began. Some of the guests enjoyed the song and dance drama "Huaiyin Ji," some danced ballroom dances, and some played various games. The Great Hall of the People presented a picture of unity and joy in a socialist family. (Attached picture)

    据新华社29日讯　中华人民共和国国务院今晚在人民大会堂宴会厅举行盛大宴会，招待前来帮助我国建设的苏联和其他兄弟国家、兄弟党的专家以及他们的夫人、孩子们，迎接即将来临的1960年。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上发表了热情的讲话。
    盛大的宴会在六时开始。出席今晚宴会的，有国务院副总理薄一波、谭震林、陆定一、习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长彭真、郭沫若等。
    应邀出席宴会的，有苏联驻华大使馆临时代办安东诺夫，苏联经济、文教专家负责人符明，各兄弟国家和兄弟党的专家，以及各兄弟国家驻华大使馆的外交官员和他们的夫人、孩子们。
    陈毅副总理的讲话得到了全场暴风雨般的热烈欢迎掌声。讲话全文如下：“亲爱的同志们：
    今天我们怀着无限愉快的心情，同苏联专家和其他兄弟国家、兄弟党的专家一道，迎接即将来临的1960年。在这个共产主义家庭式的聚会上，首先我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，向全体专家和你们的夫人、小朋友们致以热烈的祝贺和亲切的慰问。
    今天在座的专家，都是苏联和其他兄弟国家、兄弟党长期培养出来的又红又专的人才。你们的人民本来很需要你们留在你们国内工作，但是为了帮助我国建设，你们远离家乡，来到了我们的国家。你们在我国进行了忘我的劳动，毫无保留地向我国的工作人员传授了你们的先进经验，提出了许多宝贵的工作建议，对我国的社会主义建设事业作出了重要的贡献。所有这些，都充分地体现了兄弟国家、兄弟党和全体专家的高度国际主义精神。在这里，我代表我们党、我国政府和人民，向全体专家同志并且通过你们向你们的党、政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。
    在过去一年中，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，高举社会主义建设总路线的大旗，继续实现了国民经济的大跃进。在党的八届八中全会的号召和推动下，我国人民掀起了增产节约运动和生产建设的新高潮，我国的人民公社走上了巩固和健全发展的道路，这就使我们能够克服前进道路上的种种障碍，提前三年完成我国第二个五年计划的主要指标，并且为我国人民在明年和今后年份的继续跃进开辟了无限光明的前途。但是，中国人民决不会满足于已经取得的一点成就。中国人民深深懂得，他们所取得的成就，是同苏联和其他兄弟国家的帮助分不开的，是同全体专家同志们的辛勤劳动分不开的。为了争取更大的成就，我们将继续虚心地学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验，继续向全体专家同志们领教。
   同志们，我们高兴地看到，在过去一年中，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加兴旺和巩固。特别是伟大的苏联人民，在苏联共产党的领导下，取得了建设共产主义的辉煌成就和科学技术上的惊人发展，并且对维护和平的事业一再作出重大的努力。社会主义阵营的这种蓬勃发展，大大地加强了全世界人民争取和平、反对帝国主义的斗争。帝国主义为了挽救他们的厄运，正在想尽一切办法，妄图破坏社会主义国家的团结。但是，他们的这种阴谋过去已经遭到可耻的失败，今后也绝不会得逞。中国人民一向把维护中苏团结、维护社会主义阵营的团结当作自己神圣的国际义务。不论在任何情况下，我们将永远同苏联，同所有兄弟国家、兄弟党紧紧地团结在一起。今天，我们这个亲如家人的聚会，正是象征着我们无产阶级国际主义的伟大团结。我们坚信，在未来的一年中，我们的团结将会更加巩固，我们的事业将会更加兴旺，我们对争取世界和平和人类进步的斗争将会做出更大的贡献。
    现在，我提议：
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，
    为我们在新的一年中取得更大的成就，
    为全体专家和你们夫人、小朋友们的健康和幸福干杯！”
    苏联驻中国临时代办安东诺夫接着热情致词，他代表苏联驻华大使馆和苏联专家感谢陈毅同志和在今天宴会上作陪的全体中国同志，感谢对于苏联和苏联专家的祝贺以及给予他们的高度评价。他祝贺中国人民新年幸福，并且提议为苏中两国人民之间和社会主义阵营各国人民之间的永恒的、坚不可摧的友谊，为中国人民的幸福快乐，干杯。
    苏联专家负责人符明在宴会上讲话，他代表在中国工作的全体苏联专家，向中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府表示感谢。他说，1959年是苏联和中国人民取得著名于世的伟大成就的一年。在这一年中，整个社会主义阵营都沿着社会主义和共产主义的道路胜利前进。在回顾1959年的时候，我们高兴地看到，新的工厂、矿山和电站，布满了我们社会主义各国的国土。
    符明说，我们亲眼看到，中国新的技术力量正在惊人地发展着、成长着。我们特别高兴地看到，中国人民已经为1960年的建设准备了巨大的技术力量和后备力量，以迎接更加宏伟的建设任务。
    符明最后说，当我们和你们一起，为你们取得的伟大成就而欢欣鼓舞的时候，我们预祝你们在1960年取得新的、更巨大的成就。
    所有的讲话都激起了全场一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。
    今晚，政府各部门和北京市的负责人都出席了宴会，他们分别陪同客人们在一起畅饮欢谈。中国著名的演员在宴会进行过程中表演了许多精彩的助兴节目。
    宴会结束以后，盛大的联欢晚会开始。宾主们有的欣赏歌舞剧“槐荫记”，有的跳交谊舞，有的玩着各种游戏。人民大会堂里呈现着一幅社会主义大家庭团结、欢乐的景象。（附图片）
