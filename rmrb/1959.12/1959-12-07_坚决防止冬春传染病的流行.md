    Resolutely Prevent the Epidemic of Winter and Spring Infectious Diseases
    Qian Xinzhong, Vice Minister of Health
    Currently, under the situation of vigorous advancement in industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings, launching a disease elimination movement centered on the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases on the health front is extremely important. This is an important measure to ensure the smooth progress of production and construction, work, and study.
    Disease prevention is a regular task. The reason for vigorously launching a mass movement for the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases now is based on the analysis of the epidemic patterns of diseases and the characteristics of this year. First, the winter and spring climate is cold and dry, and the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors is large. This is a season when acute infectious diseases such as influenza, measles, diphtheria, and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis are prone to occur. This year, the weather turned cold earlier, and the temperature in some areas is lower than in previous years. A slight oversight can easily cause the spread of these diseases. Second, the epidemic characteristics of these diseases are that they are mostly transmitted through the air and spread rapidly, posing the greatest threat to laborers in collective production and infants and students in collective life and study. This year, with the leap forward in production and various undertakings and the further consolidation of people's communes, the number of people engaged in collective labor and collective life is increasing day by day. For example, the number of factories and enterprises in cities is constantly increasing, and infrastructure construction is being stepped up. In rural areas, large-scale water conservancy and short-distance transportation are being carried out, and a large number of farmers have been put into large-scale collective labor, while nursery organizations and primary schools are universally developing in both urban and rural areas. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the fight against winter and spring infectious diseases by utilizing the favorable conditions of collectivization. The prevention and control of gastrointestinal infectious diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, and infectious hepatitis should not be relaxed. The sources of infection for these diseases still exist, and if hygiene work does not keep up or if there are any loopholes, they will take advantage of them. In order to ensure people's health and the continued leap forward in production and construction, these diseases must be strictly guarded against. If any disease occurs, it must be eliminated wherever it occurs, and it must not be allowed to spread.
    This year, many regions have started early and grasped tightly the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases. These situations show that the work of fighting diseases has shifted to a position of active prevention. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. "Preparation ensures success." In the fight against diseases, especially against seasonal infectious diseases, it is necessary to take the initiative and defeat the enemy before they act. If we wait until the diseases have spread and then concentrate our efforts to put them out (if this situation occurs, it is of course still completely necessary), then we have already been one step behind. The slogans put forward by the Changde Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hunan Province, "Prevent the occurrence of winter and spring infectious diseases as early as possible" and "Eliminate them in the bud if they occur," are very reasonable. This spirit of striving for initiative is a concrete manifestation of going all out and striving for the upstream.
    There are currently two viewpoints that are not conducive to fighting diseases and must be overcome. One is that the occurrence of some infectious diseases, such as measles, is impossible to prevent and unavoidable. Some people say, "Children have three passes, and measles is one pass," meaning that every child is bound to get measles. The other is that the peak of influenza and measles epidemics has a "periodicity." This year is a small epidemic year for measles, so there is no need to vigorously prevent it. The global epidemic peak of influenza in 1957 has only recently passed, so it may not be prevalent this year. People who hold these two viewpoints are all derived from the same root of "resignation to fate." They see the patterns of disease occurrence and do not fully exert their subjective initiative to find ways to eliminate the disease, but succumb to difficulties, believing that the phenomenon of disease is inevitable. This erroneous thinking is a serious obstacle to doing a good job in eliminating diseases in winter and spring and must be overcome.
    Then, under our current conditions, is there any way to prevent and eliminate seasonal epidemics? The answer should be affirmative. Of course, due to the limitations of the level of development of medical science, diseases such as influenza cannot be immediately eliminated. However, on the basis of the great improvement in people's living standards, the great improvement in people's cultural level, and the great development of people's health undertakings, as long as we implement the policy of prevention first and the combination of health work and mass movements from all aspects, and effectively control diseases such as influenza and reduce their spread and prevalence, it is entirely possible. If diseases such as influenza have had periodic major epidemics in the past, it is also inseparable from people's carelessness and lack of prevention. The fact is that if prevention work is done well, major epidemics can be turned into small epidemics or no epidemics; if prevention work is not done well, small epidemics can be turned into major epidemics. For example, during the influenza pandemic in 1957, the situation in two factories in Tianjin was different. In Tianjin Heavy Machinery Plant, due to the untimely prevention work, more than 130 employees fell ill in more than ten days. The neighboring woolen mill, during the same period, took timely preventive measures, discovered and isolated patients in a timely manner, and publicized preventive knowledge to employees, so influenza did not spread there. For example, there used to be a folk saying: "After a major flood, there will be an epidemic." However, this year, in some areas in the south that experienced extraordinarily large floods, due to the close attention paid to drinking water disinfection, the strengthening of food hygiene management, and the vigorous elimination of flies, not only did no serious epidemic occur this summer and autumn, but the number of dysentery cases was even lower than in previous years. These two examples show that by grasping the patterns of disease occurrence and prevalence, as long as we actively do a good job in prevention and control and fight an active battle, it is entirely possible to control the spread of diseases.
    To do a good job in the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases and resolutely prevent the spread of winter and spring infectious diseases, it is necessary to carry out mass movements on a large scale under the leadership of the Party. Some cadres and medical personnel believe that the prevention and control of diseases is only a matter for health and medical departments, and that it does not matter much whether the masses are mobilized or not. This view is incorrect. This is still a "one-sided emphasis on treatment" rather than a comprehensive view of "combining prevention and treatment." To prevent, we must mobilize the masses to actively participate. The main means of prevention is hygiene. Only when the masses have mastered the hygiene knowledge related to the prevention of these infectious diseases and consciously abide by and implement preventive measures and hygiene systems can these diseases be most effectively prevented. Furthermore, to strengthen necessary technical measures, such as strengthening epidemic reporting, epidemic area disinfection, and isolation work, it is not possible to do well by relying solely on the strength of health and medical departments and medical personnel. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to carry out the work together, especially to rely on hygiene activists among the masses, such as hygiene workers, health workers, epidemic reporters, nursery workers, Red Cross members, and so on. Therefore, two things must be done immediately: first, vigorously launch a publicity campaign on the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases, impart preventive knowledge to the masses, so that everyone pays attention and everyone prevents; second, train and organize a team of mass hygiene activists for the prevention of winter and spring infectious diseases, so that they can penetrate into all corners of people's lives and production and become powerful helpers in the fight against diseases and implement preventive measures.
    The prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases is a central task of the current patriotic health movement and must be firmly grasped; however, the work of eliminating the four pests, eliminating parasitic diseases, and other diseases must not be relaxed and must be carried out according to the original plan. In addition, it is also necessary to prevent gas poisoning, carry out basic hygiene construction and fundamental treatment work, and factories, mines, and construction sites must also carry out safety and hygiene labor protection (preventing injuries and frostbite) work. If any of these things are not done well, they will affect the current production and construction. In order to avoid losing sight of one thing while attending to another and to strive for a comprehensive victory in health work, the Party committees at all levels must strengthen the inspection and leadership of health work while focusing on production and various central tasks; the health departments at all levels must formulate specific plans and arrangements according to local conditions and organize forces to take effective measures in conjunction with the current central tasks of production. Health workers must devote themselves to work with high revolutionary enthusiasm and soaring revolutionary spirit. In this way, our work in preventing and controlling various infectious diseases in winter and spring will surely achieve a comprehensive victory.

    坚决防止冬春传染病的流行
    卫生部副部长　钱信忠
    目前，在工农业生产和各项建设事业蓬蓬勃勃地向前跃进的形势下，卫生战线上展开一个以防治冬春季传染病为中心的除害灭病运动，是十分重要的，这是保证生产建设、工作和学习顺利进行的一项重要的措施。
    预防疾病，是经常性的工作。当前所以要大力开展一个防治冬春季传染病的群众运动，是从分析疾病的流行规律和今年的特点提出的。第一，冬春季气候寒冷、干燥，室内外温度相差很大，本是流感、麻疹、白喉、流行性脑脊髓膜炎等急性传染病容易发生流行的季节，而今年的情况是，冷得较早，有些地区气温要比往年低，稍一疏忽就容易造成这些疾病的流行。第二，这些疾病的流行特点是多经空气传染，传播迅速，对集体生产的劳动者和集体生活学习的婴幼儿和学生威胁最大；而今年的情况是，随着生产和各项事业的跃进，和人民公社的进一步巩固，集体劳动和集体生活的人数日益增多，如城市里工厂企业不断增加，基建施工正加紧进行。农村中正在大搞水利和短途运输，大批农民投入了大规模的集体劳动，而托儿组织和小学校更不分城乡普遍发展。因此，必须利用集体化的有利条件加强对冬春季传染病的斗争。对于肠胃道传染病如痢疾、伤寒、传染性肝炎的防治工作也不能放松，这些疾病的传染源仍然存在，卫生工作如果跟不上去或一有漏洞，它们就会乘隙而起。为了保证人民健康和生产建设的继续跃进，对于这些疾病一定要严加防范，万一有的疾病发生了，也要做到疾病在哪里发生就在哪里消灭，坚决不让它流行。
    今年许多地区对于防治冬春季传染病，动得早，抓得紧。这些情况说明：与疾病作斗争的工作，已转入主动预防的地位。这是极可喜的现象。凡事“豫则立”，与疾病作斗争，特别是与季节性传染病作斗争，必须掌握主动，制敌于机先，如果等到疾病发生流行开来以后才集中力量去扑灭（如果有这情况发生，当然还是完全必要的），那就已经被动了一步。中共湖南省常德市委提出的“及早预防冬春季传染病的发生”和“万一发生就把它们消灭在萌芽时期”的口号，这是很有道理的。这种力争主动的精神，就是鼓足干劲、力争上游的具体表现。
    现在有两种观点，不利于与疾病作斗争，须要加以克服。一种是认为有些传染病如麻疹的感染发生，是防不胜防的，不可避免的，如有人说：“小儿有三关，麻疹是一关”，意思是说每个孩子都免不了出麻疹；一种是认为流感、麻疹的流行高峰都有“周期性”，麻疹今年是小流行年，不必大力预防，流感1957年世界性的流行高峰过去才不久，今年不一定会流行吧。有这两种观点的人，都是来源于“听天由命”的一个根子。他们看到了疾病发生的规律，就不去充分发挥主观能动作用，千方百计地想办法消灭疾病，而是屈服于困难，认为发病的现象是不可免的。这种错误思想是做好冬春季灭病工作的严重障碍，必须加以克服。
    那末，在我们现在的条件下，倒底有没有办法来防止和消灭季节性流行病呢？答复应该是肯定的。当然，由于医学科学发展水平的限制，对流感等疾病还不能立即把它们消灭；但是，在人民生活已有很大改善，人民文化水平已有很大提高，人民卫生事业已有很大发展的基础上，只要我们从各方面贯彻预防为主和卫生工作和群众运动相结合的方针，有效地控制流感等疾病，缩小它的传布和流行，则是完全可能的。如果说流感等疾病过去曾经出现过周期性的大流行的话，那也是和人们的麻痹大意疏于防范分不开的。事实是：如果预防工作做得好，大流行完全可以变成小流行或不流行；预防工作做的不好，小流行就可以变成大流行。例如在1957年流感大流行时期，天津市有两个工厂发生的情况就不一样，天津重型机器厂，由于预防工作不及时，在十多天里有一百三十多名职工发病；邻近的毛纺织厂在同一时期内，及时地采取了预防措施，发现病人及时隔离，并向职工进行预防知识的宣传，流感就没有在那里流行起来。又如过去民间有一句谚语：“大水之后，必有疫疠”，可是今年南方一些发生特大洪水的地区，由于抓紧了饮水消毒工作，加强了饮食卫生管理，大力消灭苍蝇，今年夏秋季不但没有发生严重的疫情，痢疾发病人数比往年还少。这两个事例都说明，掌握了疾病发生流行的规律，只要积极做好防治工作，打主动仗，是完全可以控制疾病的流行的。
    要做好冬春季传染病的防治工作，坚决不让冬春季传染病流行，必须是在党的领导下，大搞群众运动。有些干部和医务人员认为，防治疾病只是卫生医疗部门的事情，发动群众与否关系不大。这种看法是不对的。这仍然是“偏重于治”的方面而不是“防治结合”的全面观点。要防，就得发动广大群众积极参加。防的主要手段是讲卫生，只有广大群众都掌握了与预防这些传染病有关的卫生知识，自觉地遵守和执行预防措施、卫生制度，才能最有效地防止这些疾病。再从加强必要的技术措施来说，如加强疫情报告、疫地消毒和隔离工作等等，单靠卫生医疗部门和医务人员的力量也是做不好的，必须发动群众共同进行，特别要依靠群众中的卫生积极分子，如卫生员、保健员、疫情报告员、保育员、红十字会员等等。因此，当前要立即做好两件事情：第一，大张旗鼓地展开一个防治冬春季传染病的宣传活动，把预防的知识交给群众，使人人注意，个个预防；第二，训练和组织一支预防冬春季传染病的群众卫生积极分子队伍，使他们深入到群众生活和生产的各个角落，成为与疾病作斗争的有力助手，贯彻执行预防措施。
    防治冬春季传染病，是当前爱国卫生运动的一项中心内容，一定要抓紧抓好；但是，对于除四害，消灭寄生虫病和其他疾病的工作，也不能放松，要按照原定计划进行。此外，还要进行防止煤气中毒、卫生基本建设和治本工作，厂矿、工地还要进行安全卫生劳动保护（防伤、防冻）工作。这些事情哪一样做不好，都会影响当前的生产建设。为了避免顾此失彼，争取卫生工作的全面胜利，必须各级党委在大抓生产和各项中心工作的同时，加强对卫生工作的检查和领导；各级卫生部门要根据当地具体情况作出具体计划和安排，并组织力量结合当前生产中心任务采取有效措施。卫生人员要以高度的革命热情和冲天的革命干劲投入工作。这样，我们冬春季防治各种传染病的工作就一定能够取得全面的胜利。
