Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 14th: The Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, Youssef el-Sebai, read out a statement by the Secretariat at a press conference today. The statement expressed serious concern about the current situation in Japan and demanded the abolition of U.S. military bases in Japan and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The Secretariat stated that Japan is facing a decisive moment in which it must choose between two paths. One path will lead to foreign troops being permanently stationed on its territory, maintaining an abnormal situation in East Asia for a long time, exacerbating world tensions, increasing the possibility of nuclear war, and undermining Afro-Asian solidarity. The other path will lead to the establishment of a completely independent and neutral Japan, which can contribute to world peace as a good member of the Afro-Asian family.

The statement continued that negotiations between the Japanese and U.S. governments are proceeding along the first path, in order to revise the current U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and make Japan even more subordinate to the U.S.-led military bloc. However, on the other hand, the Japanese people are eagerly hoping to take the latter path. They have launched a nationwide struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty," which is scheduled to be signed next January.

The Japanese Secretary of the Secretariat, Masao Kitazawa, in his statement, recounted how the U.S. imperialists used the Korean War to create a U.S.-Japan treaty that made Japan more subservient to the United States and hindered the normalization of relations between Japan and certain Afro-Asian countries.

Masao Kitazawa pointed out in his statement the essence of the conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the dangers that would subsequently arise. He drew attention to the four main points of the revision of the "Security Treaty": (1) to allow U.S. troops to continue to be stationed in Japan; (2) to change the nature of the treaty from unilateral to bilateral, so as to more firmly control Japan through "common defense obligations"; (3) the revised treaty will have a term of ten years; and (4) to allow Japan to conduct nuclear armament, because there are no clauses that oppose U.S. troops from transporting nuclear weapons into Japan.

Masao Kitazawa finally spoke of the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    亚非团结理事会书记处发表声明
    要求废除日美“安全条约”
    据新华社开罗14日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处总书记西巴伊今天在记者招待会上宣读了书记处的一项声明。声明表示严重关注日本当前的局势，并且要求取消美国在日本的军事基地和废除日美“安全条约”。
    书记处在声明中指出，日本面临着决定性的时刻，在这个时候，它必须在两条道路中作出抉择。一条道路将导致外国军队永远驻在它的领土上，使东亚长期保持不正常的局势，加剧世界紧张局势和增加爆发核战争的可能性，并且破坏亚非团结。另一条道路将导致建立一个完全独立和中立的日本，它能够作为亚非大家庭中的良好的一员而对世界和平作出贡献。
    声明继续说，日美两国政府之间的谈判正在沿着第一条道路的方向进行，以便修改目前的日美“安全条约”，而使日本更加从属于美国领导的军事集团。但是，在另一方面，日本人民热切地希望走后一条道路。他们已经展开全国性的斗争来反对修改“安全条约”，新的日美“安全条约”预定在明年1月签字。
    书记处的日本书记北泽正雄在他的声明中，追述了美帝国主义者如何利用朝鲜战争来制造了使日本更加屈从于美国、并且阻碍日本同某些亚非国家关系正常化的日美条约。
    北泽政雄在声明中指出修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋的实质以及随后将产生的危险，他提请注意修改“安全条约”的四个主要之点：（一）使美国军队继续驻扎在日本；（二）使条约的性质从单边改为双边，以便通过“共同防御义务”使日本更牢固地受美国的控制；（三）修改后的条约的期限为十年；（四）使日本进行核武装，因为没有条款规定，反对美国军队把核武器运入日本。
    北泽政雄最后谈到日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的英勇斗争。
