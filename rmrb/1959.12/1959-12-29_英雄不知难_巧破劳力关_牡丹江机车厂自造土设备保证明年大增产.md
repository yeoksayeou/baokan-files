　　Heroes Don't Know Difficulty; Cleverly Breaking Through Labor Bottlenecks: Mudanjiang Locomotive Factory Self-Manufactures Indigenous Equipment to Guarantee Increased Production Next Year
    (Our Dispatch) The Mudanjiang Locomotive Factory in Heilongjiang Province is boldly mobilizing the masses to engage in technological innovation and revolution, preparing for continued leaps forward in the first quarter of next year.

    Based on the national need for continued leaps forward in the transportation sector, the factory comprehensively considered production for the first quarter of next year and identified weak links and key problems such as insufficient labor and equipment, and a lack of auxiliary materials. The factory's Party Committee decided to adopt the approach of fully mobilizing the masses and relying on their own efforts to solve these problems. They first balanced and adjusted the manpower and equipment of each workshop and section. Then, through the "four deliveries" and "four bigs" methods of delivering the situation, delivering the tasks, delivering the difficulties, and delivering the solutions, along with big airing, big character posters, and big debates, and by adopting the principle of "small problems dispersed, big problems concentrated," they mobilized the workers to tackle projects and vigorously engage in technological innovation and revolution to break through the key areas. Because the forging workshop's task of forging locomotive axles next year would increase compared to this year, it lacked not only forging equipment but also more than sixty people. The Party organization of this workshop mobilized the masses to create two sets of indigenous forging equipment and completed thirteen technological innovations such as axle turning machines and electric material pulling machines, which greatly increased production efficiency by mechanizing and semi-mechanizing many manual operations. In the past, forging large axles required thirteen people per shift, using tongs to clamp and turn them repeatedly. Now, with the axle turning machine, only eight people are needed per shift. Furthermore, the production increased from thirteen axles per shift of eight hours to twenty to twenty-two axles. Using the electric material pulling machine to pull materials out of the large furnace reduced the number of material pulling workers from nine to three. After engaging in technological innovation and adjusting labor organization, this workshop will only need to add a few workers next year, and no additional equipment will be needed. The lower section of the locomotive workshop originally requested the leadership to add ten people. Later, the masses were mobilized to engage in technological innovation, and manpower was appropriately adjusted. As a result, not only was it unnecessary to add people, but sixteen workers were also transferred to support other sections. The mechanical processing workshop originally lacked twelve lathes. The workers took six indigenous machine tools that had been abandoned last year and improved them. They also widely promoted advanced operating methods such as high-speed cutting, multi-tool and multi-blade cutting, template-based operation, and fixture-based operation. No additional lathes will be needed in the first quarter of next year. In order to solve the problem of insufficient auxiliary materials, the factory also established satellite factories for magnesium bricks, lead powder, and water glass.

    Targeting the factory's large number of apprentices, they adopted the method of holding "production sports meets" and technical performance large-scale training to accelerate the training of apprentices. Nearly half of the more than one thousand apprentices who entered the factory last winter are now able to operate independently, and the rest have also improved their technical skills. The forty-nine apprentices in the wheel workshop, after many technical performances, learned thirty-one advanced experiences. According to work efficiency calculations, originally an average of two people could only match one skilled worker, but now one person can match one person.

    According to the original calculations, it would be necessary to add more than four hundred and fifty workers and one hundred and fifty sets of equipment next year. After these months of effort, it is now basically possible to adapt to the production needs of the first quarter of next year.

### 英雄不知难　巧破劳力关  牡丹江机车厂自造土设备保证明年大增产

　　英雄不知难　巧破劳力关
    牡丹江机车厂自造土设备保证明年大增产
    本报讯　黑龙江省牡丹江机车厂放手发动群众，大搞技术革新和技术革命，为明年第一季度的继续跃进作好准备。
    这个厂根据全国继续跃进对交通运输事业的需要，对明年第一季度的生产进行了全面考虑，发现劳动力和设备不足、辅助材料缺乏等薄弱环节和关键问题。工厂党委确定采取充分发动群众，自力更生的办法，来解决这些问题。他们首先对各车间、工段的人力、设备进行了平衡调整，然后通过交形势、交任务、交困难、交办法和大鸣大放大字报大辩论的“四交”“四大”的办法，并且采取“小问题分散、大问题集中”的原则，发动职工抢课题，大闹技术革新和技术革命来突破关键。锻冶车间因为明年锻造机车大轴的任务比今年增加，不但缺少锻造设备，而且缺少六十多个人。这个车间的党组织发动群众，创造了两台土锻造设备，完成了大轴翻料机、电动拉料机等十三项技术革新，使许多手工操作实现了半机械化和机械化，结果生产效率大大提高。过去锻大轴一班要用十三个人，用钳子夹着翻来翻去地锻，现在用大轴翻料机操作，一班只要八个人就够了，并且由原来一班八小时锻十三根大轴提高到锻二十根到二十二根。用电动拉料机从大炉里往外拉料，使拉料的工人由九个减少到三个。这个车间经过搞技术革新和调整劳动组织，明年只要增加几名工人就行了，设备也不用增加了。机车车间下部工段原来要求领导方面给增加十个人，后来，发动群众搞技术革新，适当调整了人力，结果不但不要增加人，还抽调出十六名工人支援了其他工段。机械加工车间原来缺少十二台车床，工人们把去年废置的六台土机床拿来加以改进，并且普遍推广了高速切削、多刀多刃、样板化和胎型化等先进操作方法，明年第一季度就不需要增加车床了。为了解决辅助材料不足的问题，这个厂还办起了镁砖、铅粉、水玻璃等卫星厂。
    这个厂针对本厂徒工多的情况，采取开“生产运动会”、技术表演大练兵的方法，加速培训徒工。去年冬季入厂的一千多名徒工已有近半数能够独立操作，其余的也提高了技术水平。车轮车间四十九名徒工，经过多次技术表演，学习了三十一项先进经验，按工作效率计算，原来平均两个人只能顶一名技术工人，现在已能一人顶一人。
    根据原来的计算，明年需要增加四百五十多名工人和一百五十多台设备，经过这几个月的努力，现在基本上可以适应明年第一季度的生产需要了。
