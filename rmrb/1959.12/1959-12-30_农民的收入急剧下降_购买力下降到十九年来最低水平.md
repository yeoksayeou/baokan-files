Farmers' Incomes Plummet
Purchasing Power Drops to Lowest Level in Nineteen Years

　　Despite a good harvest in the United States this year, the income and purchasing power of American farmers have plummeted.

　　According to preliminary official data, the net income of American farmers this year totals $11.1 billion, a decrease of $2 billion from last year and $4 billion from 1952.

　　On the one hand, retail prices of goods, including food, continue to rise, while on the other hand, the prices companies pay farmers for agricultural products are getting lower and lower. This situation explains why farmers' incomes are declining.

　　The "New York Times" pointed out that the purchasing power of the farmer's dollar has fallen to its lowest level in nineteen years.

　　The magazine "U.S. News & World Report," a publication of large American corporations, published a special report on the 16th entitled, "Farmers Still in Trouble, and More Trouble Ahead." The report admits that despite the U.S. government spending billions of dollars to implement its agricultural programs, "farm prices are still falling, farmers' purchasing power is at its lowest point since 1940, and farm income has fallen by $1 billion. And experts say the worst may be yet to come."

　　The magazine says that the "problem" currently facing American agriculture "remains the country's declining farm income... Now almost every bit of financial well-being of farmers points to hardship. Recent statistics reveal the following:

　　"The total number of agricultural net income, calculated at an annual rate, has decreased by $1 billion compared to the figures previously estimated for the third quarter of this year. White House economists reported on November 1st that the figure for the third quarter was $9.5 billion at an annual rate. Prior to this, Department of Agriculture economists said in mid-September that the figure for the third quarter was $10.5 billion.

　　"According to estimates by the 'U.S. News & World Report' economics department, net farm income for this year will be $11.5 billion, a decrease of 19% from $14.2 billion in 1951...

　　"This year, the net income of each farm will also be greatly reduced. It is estimated that the income per farm will be $2,476, a decrease of 17% from the $2,900 per farm in 1958."

　　The magazine points out that the purchasing power of farmers has now fallen to its lowest point since August 1940. Central market prices for agricultural products are falling to their lowest levels since the days of price controls during World War II. Government indices at the end of October showed that agricultural product prices were 86.8% of the 1947 to 1949 average.

　　The magazine also said, "Looking ahead, most economists see nothing encouraging. Almost all farms and all aspects of this country are being hit by the plight of agricultural income." The magazine pointed out that whether farmers are planting cotton, wheat, or corn, their income will be lower this year than last year.

　　The magazine concludes that the "difficult situation" facing American agriculture "is far from new. The complaints that are now being heard have been heard intermittently for nearly forty years—ever since the agricultural recession following the end of World War I in the early 1920s." "The increasingly declining agricultural income is emerging as one of the important issues in the 1960 election. Most political observers believe that it will cause the Republican Party to suffer a serious blow in the Midwest. In that region, most of the Republican congressmen elected to Congress in 1952 have already given way to a Democratic majority." As for the overall agricultural situation, "in the eyes of most agricultural leaders and politicians, the bad situation already seems certain to worsen." (Attached picture)

### 农民的收入急剧下降  购买力下降到十九年来最低水平

　　农民的收入急剧下降
    购买力下降到十九年来最低水平
    虽然美国今年的收成很好，可是美国农民的收入和购买力却急剧下降。
    据官方初步的材料，今年美国农民的纯收入共计一百一十一亿美元，比去年减少了二十亿美元，而比1952年减少了四十亿美元。
    一方面商品的零售价格，包括食品的零售价格，不断上涨，另一方面公司向农民收购农产品的价格却越来越低。这种情况说明了为什么农民收入下降。
    “纽约时报”指出，农民的美元购买力下降到十九年来最低的水平。
    美国大企业的杂志“美国新闻与世界报道”16日刊登了一篇专题报道，标题是美国“农民仍然处在困难中，而且将来会碰到更多的困难”。这篇报道承认，尽管美国政府花了几十亿美元来推行它的农业计划，但是“农产品价格还是下降，农民购买力达到1940年以来的最低点，农业收入减少了十亿美元。而专家们说，最坏的情况可能还在前面”。
    杂志说，美国农业目前面临的“问题仍然是这个国家农业收入日益减少……现在农民的几乎是每一点财政福利都指向困难。最近的统计数字表露了下面这样的情况：
    “以年率计算，农业纯收入总数比以前在今年第三季度估计的数字减少了十亿美元。白宫经济学家在11月1日报告说，第三季度的数字是年率九十五亿美元。在此以前，农业部经济学家在9月月中说第三季度的数字为一百零五亿美元。
    “据‘美国新闻与世界报道’经济部估计，今年农业纯收入将是一百一十五亿美元，比1951年的一百四十二亿美元减少了19％……
    “今年，每个农场的纯收入也将大大减少。据估计每个农场的收入为二千四百七十六美元，比1958年每个农场二千九百美元的数字下降了17％。”
    杂志指出，农民的购买力现在已下降到1940年8月以来的最低点。中央市场的农产品价格正在下降到第二次世界大战期间实行价格控制的日子以来的最低水平。10月底政府指数表明农产品价格为1947年到1949年平均数的86.8％。
    这家杂志还说，“向前看，大部分经济学家看不到什么令人鼓舞的东西。几乎是一切农场和这个国家的一切方面都正受到农业收入的困境的打击。”杂志指出，不论是种植棉花、小麦、或者玉蜀黍的农民，今年的收入都要比去年减少。
    杂志最后说，美国农业面临的“困难情况远不是新的。现在听到的埋怨声已经时断时续地听了将近四十年了——自从二十年代初期第一次世界大战结束以后农业衰退以来就听到了。”“现在农业收入日益减少是作为1960年选举的重要问题之一出现的。大部分政治观察家认为，它将使共和党人在中西部遭到严重的打击。在那个地区，1952年选出的国会里共和党国会议员大多数已经让位给民主党多数了。”至于整个农业形势，“在大部分农业领袖和政治家看来，已经是不好的形势看来肯定还要恶化。”（附图片）
