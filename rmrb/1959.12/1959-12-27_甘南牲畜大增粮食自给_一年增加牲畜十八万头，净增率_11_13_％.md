Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 26th: The people of all ethnic groups in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, are celebrating the great harvest in animal husbandry production since the communization one year ago. As of early December, the number of various livestock has increased by more than 180,000 heads compared to the same period last year, with a net increase rate of 11.13%.

Recently, reports of bumper harvests in animal husbandry have been pouring in from various places. The Taojiang Gahai Animal Husbandry Middle School's pasture has seen an average net increase rate of 30.1% in various livestock, with a sharp increase of more than 2,200 heads of livestock within one year. The net increase rate of cattle in the Tieba Commune of Longdie County reached 68%. After more than two months of effort, the herdsmen throughout the state have newly built and repaired 60,914 sheds (seats) to protect livestock safely through the winter and spring. The proportion of various livestock in the state with first-class condition has increased to 96.5%.

The strong leadership of the Party, the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, the close unity of all ethnic groups, and the soaring revolutionary vigor are the fundamental guarantees for achieving the great development of animal husbandry production this year. The Party committees at the state, county, and commune levels, based on the actual conditions of Gannan, resolutely implemented the production policy of centering on animal husbandry production, launched mass movements in a big way, and vigorously grasped inspection and appraisal. Over the past year, the state, counties, and communes have held more than 70 on-site observation meetings and on-site appraisal meetings, rewarding more than 500 advanced units and individuals, establishing pacesetters, and summarizing and popularizing advanced experiences, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses.

After communization, the majority of herdsmen began to settle down and graze, changing the past single-operation pastoral situation in some areas. This year, the area planted with grain, fodder, and other crops in pastoral areas reached more than 200,000 mu, providing more than 200 million jin of feed and fodder for livestock, while also achieving self-sufficiency in grain in pastoral areas, ensuring the high-speed development of animal husbandry production.

The high-speed development of animal husbandry in Gannan has made Gannan's role in supporting other areas increasingly significant. This year, the state has transferred a total of more than 115,000 heads of draught animals and meat animals to other areas, providing more than 200,000 pieces of hides and more than 1 million jin of wool.

　　甘南牲畜大增粮食自给
    一年增加牲畜十八万头，净增率11.13％
    据新华社兰州26日电　甘肃省甘南藏族自治州各族人民，喜庆公社化一年来畜牧业生产大丰收。截至12月上旬，各类牲畜比去年同期增加十八万多头，净增率达11.13％。
    最近以来，各地不断传来畜牧业大丰产的捷报。洮江尕海畜牧中学牧场，各类牲畜净增率平均达30.1％，一年内牲畜猛增二千二百多头；龙迭县铁坝公社牛净增率达68％。全州牧民经过两个多月的努力，在保护牲畜安全过冬春方面，已新修和补修棚圈六万零九百一十四间（座）。全州一类膘的各种牲畜已增长到96.5％。
    党的坚强领导，人民公社的无比优越性，各族人民的紧密团结和冲天的革命干劲，是取得今年畜牧业生产大发展的根本保证。州、县、公社各级党委，根据甘南的实际情况，坚决贯彻了以畜牧业生产为中心的生产方针，大搞群众运动，大抓检查评比。一年来，州、县、公社召开了七十多次现场观摩会和现场评比会，奖励先进单位和个人共五百多个，树立了标兵，总结和推广了先进经验，大大鼓舞了广大群众的积极性。
    公社化以后，广大牧民开始定居放牧，改变了部分地区过去单一经营牧业的状况。今年，牧区种植粮食、饲料等面积达二十多万亩，为牲畜提供了两亿多斤的饲草、饲料，同时做到了牧区粮食自给自足，保证了畜牧业生产高速度地发展。
    甘南畜牧业高速度地发展，使甘南支援外地的作用越来越大。在今年，全州外调役畜、肉畜共十一万五千多头，提供了二十多万件皮张，一百多万斤羊毛。（附图片）
　　人民公社化，给甘南各族人民带来了无限幸福。这是藏族牧民在放牧的情景。
