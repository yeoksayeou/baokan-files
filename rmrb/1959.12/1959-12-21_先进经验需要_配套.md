　　Advanced Experience Needs "Matching Sets"
　　The joint technical performance competition at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 3 Steel Plant vigorously promoted production. Recently, the "matching" of advanced experiences at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Northern Machinery Repair Plant has pushed the competition to a new climax. This is truly a promising and excellent method.
　　Advanced experience "matching" not only summarizes and promotes advanced experience, strengthens enterprise management, and improves the technical level of employees, but more importantly, it gathers the creative essence of the masses and consolidates the achievements of technical innovation.
　　I have seen an experienced master electrician who has worked for more than 20 years. When he uses a welding gun to draw on a workpiece, the weld is flat, smooth, and neat, unlike the usual electrician who has to flatten it with a shovel after welding. Why? He has a set of advanced experience.
　　Our "Soaring Sky" steelmaking furnace used to have a utilization rate of 80 heats after a major overhaul, but now it has been increased to 130 heats. Why? Advanced thinking has enabled steelworkers to create a complete set of advanced operating experience.
　　Similar "sets" of advanced experience, "unique skills," and "specialties" are everywhere. The wisdom of the broad masses of workers is an inexhaustible source.
　　An old technician created a "hole marking method" that could reduce two construction steps and kept it for eighteen years. I asked him why he only contributed it now? He did not answer me, just smiled. I also asked a pacesetter in a technical performance competition: why does it take you half the time to repair an electric motor compared to others? He replied, "I can't really say."
　　From the above two examples, it is not difficult to see that the reason why advanced experience has not been disseminated is partly due to the constraints of conservative thinking, but mostly because the workers' simple style makes them unaware that their experience is advanced. An additional point is that some workers who are capable and good at doing things are not very good at speaking and writing. Therefore, mobilizing the masses to summarize advanced experience, matching some fragmented and scattered advanced experiences into sets, systematizing them, and embodying them in enterprise technical management and process regulations and systems, making them the wealth of the whole people, is of great significance for promoting production and strengthening construction.
　　We are believers in continuous revolution. Last year's advanced experience may become backward this year; this year's advanced experience may not be advanced next year. Hardworking laborers are creating everything in the world in a rapidly changing way. Therefore, the work of constantly summarizing advanced experience and constantly matching advanced experience into sets has infinite vitality.
　　Who will do the matching? The masses! It can only be the masses. Then let us take out all the advanced experience, pool our ideas and work together to sort out all the advanced experience and match it into sets!

### 先进经验需要“配套”

　　先进经验需要“配套”
    鞍钢第三钢铁厂的联合技术表演赛，有力地推动了生产。最近鞍钢北部机修厂的先进经验“配套”，又把竞赛推向了新的高潮，这真是一件大有可为的好办法。
    先进经验“配套”，不仅总结和推广了先进经验，加强了企业管理和提高职工技术水平，更重要的是汇集了群众的创造精华，巩固了技术革新的成果。
    我见过一位干过二十多年电焊工的老师傅，他用焊枪往工件上一划，焊口平整光滑，干净利索，不像通常见到的电焊工，焊完还要用铲锉平。为什么？他有一套先进经验。
    我们这里的“冲天号”炼钢炉，过去炉体经过一次大修，使用率为八十炉次，现在提高到一百三十炉次。为什么？先进的思想使炼钢工人创造了一整套先进操作经验。
    类似这些先进经验的“套套”，“绝招儿”“拿手”到处都有，广大劳动者的智慧是取之不尽、用之不竭的源泉。
    有一位老技师，他创造了一种能够减少两道施工工序的“号眼划线法”，一直保留了十八年。我问他为啥才献出来？他没有回答我，只是笑了笑。我还问过一位技术表演竞赛的标兵：为什么同样修一台电动机所需要的工时，你比别人少一半？他回答说：“我也说不好。”
    从上述两个例子中，不难看出，先进经验所以没有传播出来，少部分是受保守思想的束缚，而大部分是由于工人淳朴的作风使他们自己觉不出自己的经验是先进的。附带的一点是有些能做会干的工人，还不太能说会写。所以，发动群众总结先进经验，把一些零碎的分散的先进经验配成套，系统化，将它体现在企业技术管理和工艺规程制度中去，成为全民的财富，对于促进生产，加强建设就有着重大的意义了。
    我们是不断革命论者。去年的先进经验，今年也许就变得落后了；今年的先进经验，明年就不一定是先进的。辛勤的劳动者，在日新月异地创造世界上的一切，因此，不断总结先进经验，不断把先进经验配套的工作，也就有着无限的生命力。
    谁来配套？群众！只能是群众。那就让我们把先进经验都拿出来，集思广益，一齐动手，把所有的先进经验都整理整理配成套吧！
