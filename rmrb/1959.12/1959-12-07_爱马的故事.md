The story of loving horses
By our reporter Ding Wen

Horses don't get fat without eating night grass
There is a saying in the countryside: "Horses don't get fat without eating night grass." Every experienced horse feeder understands the importance of this saying. But how exactly can you feed horses well? It's not enough to just remember this saying; you have to think of many ways.

Du Yongfu, the deputy head of the sideline production team of the Hongguang People's Commune in Hutubi County, northern Xinjiang, is a horse feeder who has both inherited the horse-feeding experience accumulated by the people and has come up with various ways to feed the horses well.

For more than four years, from the advanced agricultural cooperative to the people's commune, he has been a horse feeder. To feed the horses well, every spring, as soon as the grass sprouts in the fields, as long as the horses he feeds are not away on assignment at night, he always drives the horses to the grass bay by the reed lake in the north, accompanying them through the long night, until the horses have eaten their fill of fresh dew-covered grass before dawn, then he drives them back. One summer evening this year, just as he was habitually winding the reins of the horses around their necks to drive them out, suddenly a dust storm that blotted out the sky and the sun blew in from the northwest. This was a sign of a rainstorm, and the team's cadres busily advised him not to go out tonight. He said, "Horses aren't afraid of wind and rain." He turned back to his house, took a broken sack, and drove the horses out. It poured rain for half the night, and when he returned, he was soaked from head to toe, but he still tethered the horses to the troughs one by one before going home to change clothes. To let the horses eat more fresh grass, he didn't know how many nights were like this one.

In winter, when the grass withered, he slept in a small room next to the horse pen every night, getting up three or four times a night to feed the horses until they were full.

He not only let the horses eat good night grass, but also took extra care of the horses at ordinary times. He often said: Horses have their likes and dislikes, and each has its own temperament. If they don't get along and are tied to the same trough, they will either kick and bite each other, or they won't eat well. Based on his observations, he fixed horses that could get along together at the same trough, tying the ones with big mouths together with the ones with big mouths, so that some horses would not eat poorly or not get enough to eat. When the horses returned from work, he always let the horses move around for a while before feeding them grass, and after feeding them a few percent full, he gave the horses some water. He said: Horses are always thirsty and hungry after working, and eating and drinking too much at one time can easily cause illness. At the same time, he also paid great attention to the hygiene of the horse pen. Because he was diligent and careful, the horses he fed never delayed production, and he could save the team a large amount of feed every year. Therefore, he was named a model horse feeder every year, and this year on National Day he was also selected as a labor model for the whole county.

One cold morning, I found this horse feeder, praised by everyone, under the horse shed of the Hezhuang Brigade. This is a 58-year-old man. Years of hired labor life have covered his face with wrinkles that have weathered the storm, but he still works like a young man. On this freezing morning, he was not wearing a cotton coat and was carrying horse manure out with two specially made large manure baskets, one on each shoulder. Taking advantage of this gap, I looked at the horse shed and enclosure, and indeed it lived up to its reputation. Whether it was the horse trough, the horse pen, or the outer horse shed, they were all neatly repaired and spotlessly clean. After he finished cleaning up, he led me to the yard and the mill to see the horses he fed. He fed a total of eighteen horses, twelve of the best ones had gone to the mountains to pull charcoal, and six were left at home for odd jobs, but even among these six horses, there was not a single weak one. When we walked into the mill, the gray and white horse with blinders on its eyes immediately pricked up its ears and neighed. I asked, "Why is the horse neighing?" The person grinding flour replied, "Shapi horse (the name Du Yongfu gave this horse) heard his master coming!" He said: Any horse fed by Du, not to mention hearing him speak, even hearing his footsteps and coughs, will neigh. The relationship between the horse and Du is very deep!

Noble feelings
Speaking of his feelings for horses, the members of the Hezhuang Brigade will tell you the story of how he saved this Shapi horse.

One summer evening this year, the driver Aishan returned from the mountains pulling wood. As soon as he unloaded the cart, the other horses immediately ran off jubilantly, but only the Shapi horse, which was now harnessed to the mill, didn't even want to roll around, and didn't have any energy when walking. He busily asked, "Did something happen to the horse on the road?" Aishan said, "Nothing, maybe it's just tired!" He was not at ease, so after arranging the other horses properly, he pulled the Shapi horse to his side and carefully stroked it all over, and found that the horse's belly was as swollen as a drum, and a big lump the size of a fist had swollen on its neck. He immediately determined that the horse had stopped eating and was suffering from heat and a sore throat. If it was not treated immediately, it would be in danger. But the nearby veterinarian happened to have gone to another village. What should he do? He immediately went home, took out clear oil, had his wife heat the oil, put a bowl of yellow millet in the oil, popped it into millet flowers, let it cool, and carefully poured it down the horse's throat. Then he gave the horse acupuncture, took a large sack and draped it over the horse's back, and slowly led the horse for a walk. While walking the horse, he thought, as long as he could clear the horse's heat, loosen its bowels, let the horse sweat a little, and not let it lie down, there would be a good chance of recovery. In this way, resting for a while, walking for a while, until before dawn, the horse really started to have diarrhea, and he breathed a sigh of relief. Just then, his wife ran panting to the horse stable and said that Xilan (his daughter) was ill and asked him to help take her to the hospital for a look. He looked at the Shapi horse thoughtfully: What will happen to the horse's illness if I leave? He decided not to go home, so he said to his wife, "You go and think of a way." He did not leave the horse for three days and three nights, staying with it until the horse's illness was cured, then he managed to find time to go home and see his daughter.

He not only took such good care of this Shapi horse, but also took good care of all the horses in the brigade. Last summer, their team added four new horses, all of which were so thin that their skin was wrapped around their bones, with festering sores on their shoulders and backs, unable to pull even six or seven hundred pounds of goods. Some people advocated selling them off to avoid losing money if they died. He carefully inspected the horses and found that the main reason was that they were not being fed well, so he took the initiative to take care of them, applying medicine to these horses two or three times a day, making the fodder very fine, feeding them more times a day and less each time, and when he was free, he would pull them around for a walk and groom their fur. After a month of care, the festering sores on the horses' bodies were all healed, and they had also gained weight. Now these horses are exactly the same as the horses he fed, and they have grown very strong.

I asked Du Yongfu why he loved horses so much? He told me the story of loving horses with profound meaning.

He said: Our place has a lot of fertile land, but no livestock; no matter how much land there is or how good it is, it still can't grow much grain. From the age of sixteen, I worked as a short-term laborer and a long-term laborer for the landlord, working like an ox or a horse for thirty-two years. At that time, I often reclaimed some land and planted crops, but I couldn't afford livestock, and the crops grown in the field were always half as short as the landlord's crops. The landlord also ridiculed me for having the fate of a long-term laborer. It wasn't until the land reform that I and another farmhand shared a jujube-red horse. Because I loved horses, I used part of my land to exchange for this horse and fed it until it was fat and strong. But poor people can't farm just by relying on horses, lacking this and lacking that. It wasn't until I joined the cooperative that I paid off the debts I had borrowed before.

Speaking of this, he paused slightly, and said again: I knew that joining the cooperative was good, but when it came to transferring to an advanced cooperative, when it was mentioned that the horse also had to join the cooperative, I really felt a little reluctant. A few people even suggested that I could exchange this horse for three horses, so I should sell it and just buy one to join the cooperative. Those few nights, I couldn't even sleep well. After thinking about it, I still couldn't sell this horse. In the old society, I worked as a long-term laborer for a lifetime, and I didn't even earn a donkey's tail after thinking about horses for so many years. Chairman Mao led us to establish advanced cooperatives and develop production. How could I sell this livestock? Later, I led the horse into the cooperative's horse pen. People in the cooperative said that I fed horses well and asked me to be a horse feeder. People who have farmed know that without capable livestock, how can you grow more grain? Everyone in the cooperative believes in me, so how can I not love the cooperative's livestock? (Attached picture)

    爱马的故事
    本报记者　丁文
    马不吃夜草不肥
    农村里流传着这样一句谚语：“马不吃夜草不肥。”凡是喂马的老手，都懂得这句话的重要。可是究竟怎样才能把马喂好？光凭记着这一句话不行，还得想许许多多办法。
    新疆北部呼图壁县红光人民公社和庄大队副业队的杜永福，就是一个既继承了民间积累起来的喂马经验，又想了种种办法把马喂好的饲养员。
    从高级农业社到人民公社，四年多来，他一直当饲马员。为了把马喂好，每年春天，当地里的青草一发芽，只要自己喂的马夜间没出差，他总是把马赶到北边芦苇湖旁的草湾里，陪着马度过漫长的黑夜，直到天亮前马吃饱了新鲜的露水草，才赶回来。今年夏天的一个傍晚，正当他习惯地把一匹匹马的缰绳盘在马脖子上往外赶时，突然西北方向刮起了遮天避日的大黄风。这是暴风雨的预兆，队里的干部忙劝他今夜不要出去了。他说了声：“马又不怕风雨。”翻回身到家里拿了一条破口袋，便赶上马出去了。倾盆大雨整整下了半夜，他回来时，浑身上下淌着水，可是他还是把马一匹一匹拴在槽上，才回家换衣服。为了让马多吃一些新鲜草，不知道有多少个夜晚都和这一夜一样。
    冬天草枯了，他每夜便和衣睡在马圈隔壁的一间小屋里，一夜要起来三、四次，把马喂的饱饱的。
    他不单让马吃好夜草，平时对马也管的特别细致。他常说：马有相好的，也有合不来的，各有各的脾性，合不来的拴在一个槽上不是踢伤咬伤，就是吃不好草。根据他的观察，他把能合在一起的马固定在一个槽上，口大的和口大的拴在一起，免得有的马吃不好，吃不饱。马干了活回来，他总是先放开马活动一会，然后才喂草，喂上几成饱就给马饮一些水。他说：马干了活总是又渴又饿，一次吃喝得过饱，容易得病。同时他也十分注意马圈的卫生，由于他勤快、细心，他喂的马从来没耽误过生产，年年还能给队里节省大批饲料。因此，他年年被评为模范饲养员，今年国庆节又被选为全县的劳动模范。
    一个寒风刺骨的清晨，我在和庄大队的马棚下找到了这位人人夸奖的饲养员。这是一位五十八岁的老年人，多年的长工生活，使他的脸上布满了饱经风霜的皱纹，可是干活的样子还完全像个年青人。在结冰的早晨，他全身上下还没穿一件棉衣，正在用两个特制的大粪筐，一担一担往外面挑马粪。趁着这个空隙，我看了看马的棚圈，果然名不虚传，无论是马槽、马圈和外边的马棚，都修理的整整齐齐，一干二净。等他收拾停当，便领我到院子和磨房里，看他喂的马匹。他一共喂了十八匹马，十二匹顶好的都到山里拉炭去了，家里剩下六匹作零活，可是这六匹马中也找不出一匹瘦弱的。当我们走进磨房，这匹双眼戴着按眼的灰白马立即竖直两只耳朵，叫起来。我问“马叫什么？”磨面的人回答：“沙皮马（杜永福给这匹马起的名字）听见他的主人来啦！”他说：凡是杜老汉喂的马，不要说听见他说话，就是听见他的脚步声和咳嗽声，也会叫起来，马和杜老汉的感情可深厚啦！
    崇高的感情
    提起他和马的情感，和庄大队的社员便会告诉你他救活这匹沙皮马的故事。
    今年夏天的一个黄昏，赶车员艾山从山上拉木料回来，一卸车，别的马立即欢腾的跑开了，只有现在这匹套磨的沙皮马滚也不想打，走起路来没一点精神。他忙问：“马在路上出了什么事？”艾山说：“没什么，大概是乏了吧！”他不放心，等把别的马安置妥当，便把沙皮马拉在身边，周身上下细细抚摸了一遍，发现马肚子涨得像鼓似的，脖子上也肿起拳头似的一个大疙瘩。他立即断定马吃停了食，又受了热，得了嗓?，不立即治疗就有危险。可是附近的兽医又偏巧到别的村去了。怎么办呢？他立即回家取出清油，让妻子将油熬热，把一碗黄糜子下在油里，爆成糜子花，放凉后，小心翼翼地给马灌下去，然后又给马扎了针，拿了一条大口袋搭在马背上，慢慢牵着马溜去了。一边溜马，他一边想，只要能给马清清火，泻泻肚，让马出点汗，不要卧倒，就有好的可能。就这样，歇一会，溜一会，一直到天亮前，马果真泻起肚子来，他才松了一口气。正在这时，他的妻子气喘喘地跑到马房里说，喜兰（他的女儿）得了病，让他帮着抱到医院看一看。他瞅着沙皮马沉思着：我走了马的病怎么办？他决定不回家，便对妻子说：“你去想想办法吧。”他三天三夜都没有离开马，一直守到马的病好了，才抽出身来回家看了看自己的女儿。
    他不光对这匹沙皮马这般爱护，而是对大队所有的马都很爱护。去年夏天，他们队里新添了四匹马，个个瘦得皮包骨头，肩上、背上生着浓疮，连六、七百斤重的东西也拉不动。有些人主张把它们卖掉，免得死了赔本。他把马详细地检查了一番，发现主要是喂得不好，便主动地把它们管起来，天天给这几匹马上两、三回药，又把草料制作得细细的，一天多喂几次，一次少喂一点，一闲下来便拉着溜一溜，给马梳洗皮毛。护理了一个月，马身上的浓疮全好了，膘也催起来了，现在这几匹马已和他所喂的马完全一样，长得十分健壮了。
    我问起杜永福为什么这般爱马？他意味深长地给我讲起爱马的故事来。
    他说：我们这个地方，地多地肥，可是没有牲口；地再多再好，还是长不出多少粮食来。从十六岁起，我就给地主打短工、扛长工，整整当了三十二年牛马。那时也常开垦些地，种上庄稼，可是买不起牲口，地里长的庄稼总比地主的庄稼矮一半，地主也讥笑我是长工命。直到土地改革时，才和另外一个雇农伙分了一匹枣红马。我因为爱马，就用一部分地把这匹马换过来，喂得又肥又壮。可是穷人种地光靠马也不行，缺这缺那，直到我入了合作社，才还清了从前借的债。
    说到这里，他稍停了一停，又说：我明知道入了社好，可是转高级社时，一提到马也要入社，心里真有些舍不得。有少数人还给我出主意，说这匹马能换三匹马，让我卖了，随便买一匹入社算了。那几夜，我连觉也睡不好，想来想去，还是不能卖了这匹马。旧社会我当了一辈子长工，想了多少年马，也没挣下一个驴尾巴。毛主席领导我们成立高级社，发展生产，我能把这头牲口卖了吗？后来我就把马牵进了合作社的马圈里。社里人都说我喂马喂得好，让我担任饲马员。种过地的人都知道，没有得力的牲口，还能多打粮食？社里人人相信我，我又怎能不爱社里的牲口呢？（附图片）
