Zhuzhou People Control the Backflow of the Xiang River
Striving to Ensure Full Harvests on More Than 90,000 Mu of "Large Water Fields" Next Year

(Our report) The people of Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, are undertaking large-scale water conservancy projects to control the harm caused by the backflow of the Xiang River. This project is massive in scale, requiring the construction of 120 kilometers of long dikes along the Xiang and Lu Rivers, 103 large and small water gates, and 4,000 small reservoirs, ponds, dams, and canals.

The biggest water disaster in the suburbs of Zhuzhou City over the years has been the backflow of the Xiang River. The Xiang River runs north-south through Zhuzhou for 90 kilometers, and its tributary, the Lu River, runs east-west. The two major rivers encompass hundreds of large and small river ports in the area, forming a dense network of waterways in the suburbs of Zhuzhou. However, due to the low-lying terrain of the downstream areas of each river port, the Xiang River rises every year after April, and the river water flows back into the ports, flooding the banks. The surrounding farmland is then submerged, and replanting can only take place after the water recedes. This type of field is locally called "large water fields." The Xiang River rises and falls several times each year, and the "large water fields" along the Xiang and Lu Rivers are flooded several times as well, up to five or six times a year, or at least three or four times, greatly affecting agricultural production and people's lives.

After liberation, the Party led the masses in a struggle against the floods, building some flood control dikes along the ports and establishing a water situation forecasting system. At the same time, some mountain ponds and reservoirs were built to store water, so the "large water fields" in this area still yielded harvests every year. However, because the mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives were weak in the past, they could not completely eradicate the water damage. More than 90,000 mu of "large water fields" remained along the river, accounting for about one-sixth of the total farmland area in the suburbs, and could still only grow one crop of rice per year. Even in good years, only 50% of the harvest could be achieved. Moreover, the repeated replanting consumed a large amount of labor, seeds, and fertilizer, making it an obstacle to the continued leap forward in agricultural production in the suburbs of Zhuzhou.

This year, the Zhuzhou Municipal Party Committee is determined to eradicate this historical water disaster. Leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee personally inspected the Xiang River, studied the city's water system, summarized the experience of water management in the past few years, researched water management methods, and formulated a comprehensive management plan for this year. It was decided to build twelve large water gates at the entrances of the twelve major river ports flowing into the Xiang and Lu Rivers, and thirty-eight medium-sized water gates and fifty-three small water gates at other small ports. When the water level of the Xiang and Lu Rivers is lower than the water level of the river ports, the gates will be opened, and the mountain floods and waterlogged fields upstream of the river ports can be discharged into the Xiang and Lu Rivers through the river ports. When the water level of the Xiang and Lu Rivers is equal to or higher than the water level of the river ports, the gates will be closed to prevent the river water from flowing back into the ports. At the same time, 120 kilometers of long dikes will be built on both sides of the Xiang and Lu Rivers at both ends of each water gate, level with the top surface of the water gate. This will raise the entire riverbank of the Xiang and Lu Rivers (two meters higher than the highest flood level in the area in 1954), so that the Xiang River will no longer be able to overflow the riverbank and submerge farmland during floods. In order to intercept floodwaters, store water, ensure irrigation, and regulate the river volume of the Xiang River during floods, it was also decided to add 4,000 small reservoirs, ponds, dams, and canals in the upstream and midstream areas of each river port. During construction, the principles of equal emphasis on dams and canals, the combination of dikes and gates, and the connection of dams and canals were implemented, so that this magnificent water conservancy project could quickly exert its benefits in flood control, irrigation, and soil and water conservation. The goal is to ensure a full harvest on more than 90,000 mu of "large water fields" next year, and to expand the double-cropping rice area by 150,000 to 200,000 mu. There will be no need for repeated replanting. In this way, 1 million jin of rice seeds can be saved each year, and 450,000 to 500,000 labor days can be saved. The labor force used for flood control and rescue in previous years can be concentrated on accumulating fertilizer and strengthening field management. This will not only fundamentally change the water conservancy landscape of Zhuzhou City, but also bring great benefits in changing the current situation where residential areas are generally concentrated in mountainous areas, turning dikes into roads, developing transportation, comprehensively repairing water conservancy, and building small hydropower stations.

After the Municipal Party Committee issued the fighting call of "Managing a hundred river ports, building a thousand li of dikes, conquering a hundred li of the Xiang River, and vowing to seize ten thousand dan of grain and cotton" to the people of the city, a high tide of industrial and agricultural cooperation in water conservancy construction was immediately launched. Many factories dispatched technicians to help the communes survey and design, and supported a large number of steel and cement to help build the gates. According to the engineers' calculations, the entire gate construction project would require 10,000 tons of cement and more than 1,000 tons of steel. After the masses contributed ideas and methods, they found ways to replace cement with "three-in-one" soil, so the entire project could be completed with only 3,000 tons of cement and 200 tons of steel, while ensuring the quality of the project. One hundred thousand laborers in the suburbs of the city have invested in this great battle.

　　建闸筑堤  挖塘修渠  拦蓄洪水
    株洲人民控制湘水倒灌
    力争九万多亩“大水田”明年全部保收
    本报讯　湖南株洲市人民为治服湘江江水倒灌为害，大兴水利。这个工程规模巨大，要在湘江、渌水沿岸修一百二十公里的长堤，建大小水闸一百零三座，小型水库及塘、坝、渠道等四千处。
    株洲市郊历年来最大的水患是湘水倒灌。湘江南北纵贯株洲境内有九十公里，它的支流——渌水，横贯于江东。两条大水吞纳着全境数以百计的大小河港，构成株洲市郊密如蛛网的水系。可是，由于各条河港下游地势低洼，每年4月以后湘江水涨，江水即倒流回港，泛滥于沿河两岸，附近的农田就被淹没，水退后才能补种。这种田当地称为“大水田”。每年湘江几涨几落，沿湘江、渌水两岸的“大水田”也几次被淹，多到每年淹五、六次，少也有三、四次，对农业生产和人民生活影响很大。
    解放后，党领导群众向水灾展开了斗争，在沿港一带筑了一部分防洪堤，建立了水情预报制度，同时还修了一些山塘、水库蓄水，因此这一带的“大水田”年年还有收成。但由于过去互助组、农业社力量单薄，无法彻底根治水害，沿江的“大水田”还留下有九万多亩，约占全郊区田亩总面积的六分之一，每年仍只能种一季稻谷，好年成也只有五成收；而且因为三番五次的重插补种，多用的人工、种子、肥料更是难以计算，成为株洲市郊农业社生产继续跃进的一个障碍。
    今年，中共株洲市委决心要根治这一历史性的水患，市委负责同志亲自沿湘江实地察看，研究全市水系，总结了以往几年来治水的经验，研究了治水方法，制定了今年全面治理的规划，决定在全市的十二条大河港流入湘江、渌水的入口处修建十二座大型水闸，在其他的小港口分别修建三十八座中型水闸和五十三座小型水闸。当湘江、渌水水位低于河港水位时，就开放闸门，河港上游的山洪和垅田渍水，都能通过河港泄入湘江、渌水；湘江、渌水水位与河港水位相平或高于河港水位时，就关闭闸门，挡住江水倒流入港。同时在各个水闸两头，沿湘江、渌水两岸分别修筑建成一百二十公里的长堤，做到与水闸顶面相平。这样就使整个湘江、渌水的河岸增高（比1954年当地最高洪水水位还要高出二米），使湘江在涨水时再也不能漫过河岸，吞没农田。为了拦洪蓄水，保证灌溉，调节湘江涨水时的河港水量，又决定在各河港的上游、中游增修四千处小型水库及塘、坝、渠道等。在修建中，贯彻坝渠并重、堤闸结合、坝成渠通的方针，使这一规模宏伟的水利工程在防洪、灌溉、水土保持等方面，都迅速发挥效益，力争明年九万多亩“大水田”全收，而且可以扩大双季稻面积十五到二十万亩，再不需要三番五次地重插补种了。这样谷种每年就可节省一百万斤，劳动日可以节省四十五到五十万个，往年用来防洪抢险的劳力就可以集中用于积肥和加强田间管理。这样不仅从根本上改变株洲市的水利面貌，而且在改变目前居民点普遍集中于靠山地方的状况，把大堤变成公路，发展交通、综合修水利，建设小型水电站等方面，都将收到很大的效益。
    当市委向全市人民发出了“治港百条，筑堤千里，征服百里湘江，誓夺万担粮棉”的战斗号召以后，全市立刻掀起了一个工农协作的兴修水利高潮。许多工厂抽出技术人员帮助公社勘察设计，支援了大批钢筋、水泥帮助建闸。原来按工程师计算，全部建闸工程需要一万吨水泥，一千多吨钢筋，经过群众献策献计，找出了以三合土代水泥等办法，全部工程只花三千吨水泥、二百吨钢筋就能建成，同时保证了工程质量。全市郊区有十万劳力投入了这一场伟大战斗。
