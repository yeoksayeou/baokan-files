Xinhua News Agency, December 12th, Hong Kong News: Newspapers in Hong Kong and Macao have recently published editorials, articles, and letters from overseas Chinese readers in Indonesia. These newspapers and the readers writing to them unanimously and strongly demand that the Indonesian authorities stop anti-Chinese activities and properly resolve the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia in accordance with the spirit of the Joint Communiqué of the Foreign Ministers of China and Indonesia. They unanimously pointed out that the increasingly serious anti-Chinese activities taking place in Indonesia are jeopardizing the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. The Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" published a commentary on November 4th, stating that the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia have aroused widespread concern among people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It wrote, "The actions of Indonesian wartime power holders in such a near-crazy expulsion and persecution of overseas Chinese are events that violate humanitarian principles, deviate from international morality, and insult the dignity of the Chinese nation." The commentary refuted the lies of Indonesian anti-Chinese elements who claimed that the persecution of overseas Chinese was to "solve the difficulties of the national economy" and that overseas Chinese endangered local security.

The newspaper said in an editorial on November 6th that the current anti-Chinese activities launched by some Indonesian wartime power holders are not measures that should be taken towards the nationals of a friendly country, nor are they the attitude that should be taken towards a friendly country. It runs counter to the ten principles of the Bandung Conference and falls precisely into the trap of U.S. imperialism to divide the unity of the Asian people in order to defeat them one by one.

The Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" published a commentary on November 5th, stating, "In fact, anti-Chinese activities are detrimental to Indonesia. Anti-Chinese activities affect Indonesia's rural economy and bring chaos to Indonesia's economy. Overseas Chinese are certainly harmed, but the Indonesian people, especially Indonesians in rural areas, are also harmed. Only a few reactionaries take the opportunity to make trouble, plunder the property of overseas Chinese, and benefit from it."

An article by a Hong Kong businessman published in "Ta Kung Pao" on December 1st said, "Indonesian wartime power holders dare not touch the large enterprises of imperialism in Indonesia at all, but instead target overseas Chinese small businessmen, hitting lambs instead of tigers, which is not the act of a wise man."

The "New Evening Post" published a commentary on November 6th, saying: For many years, people have not seen ordinary overseas Chinese harming Indonesia, but those who harm Indonesia are only the colonialists and imperialists from the West. Last year, it was the Americans who supported the rebellion and wanted to subvert the Republic of Indonesia.

The "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" published an editorial on November 10th, saying: Indonesia's anti-Chinese activities are actually a move that harms others and oneself, and is unjust and unwise; generally speaking, overseas Chinese have not done anything to offend Indonesia, and they have actually contributed to the development of Indonesia's economy.

The "Macao Daily News" published a commentary on November 8th, saying that Indonesia is one of the countries that supports the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and participated in the Bandung Conference. One of the provisions of the Bandung Conference is that all disputes should be resolved through peaceful negotiations, but now, Indonesian wartime power holders are using unilateral coercive measures, and even arbitrary looting methods, to forcibly relocate overseas Chinese. The newspaper asked, is this in line with the spirit of the Bandung Conference? The newspaper hopes that the Indonesian authorities will earnestly implement the Joint Communiqué of the Foreign Ministers of China and Indonesia and follow the spirit of the communiqué to resolve the overseas Chinese issue.

    港澳报纸要求印度尼西亚停止迫害华侨
    排华活动违背万隆精神
    恰恰中了美国分裂亚洲人民团结诡计
    据新华社12日讯　香港消息：香港和澳门的报纸最近连续发表社论、文章和在印度尼西亚的华侨读者的来信。这些报纸和写信给它们的读者一致强烈要求印度尼西亚当局停止排华活动，并且根据中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长联合公报的精神来妥善地解决在印度尼西亚的华侨问题。他们一致指出，在印度尼西亚发生的日益严重的排华活动正在危害着中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系。香港“文汇报”11月4日发表评论说，印度尼西亚的排华活动已经引起香港九龙各界人士广泛的关心。它写道，“印度尼西亚战时掌权者这种迹近疯狂的排斥华侨、迫害华侨的行动，是违反人道原则、背离国际道义、侮辱中国民族尊严的事件。”评论驳斥了印度尼西亚排华分子所说的迫害华侨是为了“解决民族经济的困难”和华侨危害当地安全等谎言。
    这家报纸在11月6日的社论中说，某些印度尼西亚战时掌权者目前掀起的排华活动，不是对待友好国家侨民所应采取的措施，不是对待友好国家应有的态度。它和万隆会议的十项原则背道而驰，恰恰中了美帝国主义分裂亚洲人民的团结以便它各个击破的诡计。
    香港“大公报”11月5日发表评论说，“排华事实上对印度尼西亚是不利的。排华影响印度尼西亚的农村经济，给印度尼西亚经济带来混乱。华侨固然受害，印度尼西亚人民，尤其是农村中的印度尼西亚人，也同样受害。只有少数反动派乘机捣乱，掠夺华侨的财物，得到好处。”
    “大公报”在12月1日发表的一位香港商人的文章说，“印度尼西亚的战时掌权者对帝国主义在印度尼西亚的大企业不敢触动分毫，却向华侨小商人开刀，不打老虎打羔羊，非智者所为。”
    “新晚报”11月6日发表评论说：多少年来，人们并没有看到一般侨胞损害印度尼西亚，而损害印度尼西亚的只是来自西方的殖民主义者、帝国主义者。去年支持叛乱，要颠覆印度尼西亚共和国的正是美国人。
    “香港商报”11月10日发表社论说：印度尼西亚的排华活动，实际上是损人损己，不义不智之举；一般而论，华侨并没有做过什么对不起印度尼西亚的事情，他们对于印度尼西亚经济之发展实际上是有过贡献的。
    “澳门日报”11月8日发表评论说，印度尼西亚是赞成和平共处五项原则和参加万隆会议的国家之一。万隆会议就有一条规定，一切纠纷通过和平谈判来解决，而现在，印度尼西亚战时掌权者却用片面强迫手段，甚至用任意劫掠的办法来迫迁华侨，这家报纸问道，难道这是符合万隆会议精神的吗？报纸希望印度尼西亚当局认真执行中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长联合公报，遵循公报的精神来解决华侨问题。
