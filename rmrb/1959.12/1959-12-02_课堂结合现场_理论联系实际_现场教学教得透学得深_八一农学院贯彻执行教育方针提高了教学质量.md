    Classroom Combined with On-Site Practice, Theory Linked with Reality
    On-Site Teaching Teaches Thoroughly and Learns Deeply
    August 1st Agricultural College Implements the Education Policy and Improves Teaching Quality
    (By our correspondent) The August 1st Agricultural College in Xinjiang has achieved remarkable results in implementing the educational policy of combining education with productive labor. They have adopted the method of on-site teaching, closely integrating the classroom with the site, linking theory with practice, and greatly improving the quality of teaching and scientific research work.
    The August 1st Agricultural College was established in 1952 by the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps. Over the past seven years, the August 1st Agricultural College has developed into a higher education institution with six departments, seven majors, and more than two thousand students and three hundred and fifty teachers. It has sent more than three thousand seven hundred graduates to Xinjiang and some inland provinces and regions.
    At the beginning of this year, in order to better implement the educational policy of combining education with productive labor, according to the instructions of the higher authorities and in light of the school's situation, eighty-two teachers and nine hundred and forty-nine students from the entire college were dispatched to farms, forestry farms, ranches, and people's communes in Nanshan, Hutubi, Wula Wusu, Shawan, Tacheng, Aksu, Kashgar, Toksun, and Yingjisha in Urumqi. During labor, each class and grade conducted on-site teaching for twenty-eight courses, from preparation and lecturing to discussion, practice, and even performance assessment, and achieved significant results. In the process of on-site teaching, the glorious traditions of the school were fully developed. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, they formulated a teaching plan for the down-to-the-countryside stage. On-site teaching was carried out for courses with strong observation and operation content or difficult to teach and learn well in the school, and where the conditions of the production unit were superior to the school. Secondly, they focused on ideological transformation and practical skills, so that on-site teaching was combined with labor training for teachers and students, and the teaching plan was coordinated with the business plan of the farm (commune), ensuring a perfect match between teaching, practice, and labor. Before spring sowing, they lectured on pre-sowing land preparation, seed treatment, and sowing methods, and then worked with farm workers and commune members in spring sowing labor. In addition, in the spirit of "more labor during busy farming seasons and more learning during slack farming seasons," the time for teaching and labor was appropriately arranged to ensure consistency between learning and doing.
    Through on-site teaching, the quality of teaching has been greatly improved. First of all, students combine theoretical study with on-site observation and practical operation, which not only increases perceptual knowledge and consolidates theoretical knowledge, but also cultivates the ability to think and work independently. For example, Mo Lingrong, a student in the Water Conservancy Department, directed the construction of canal construction with several thousand people in Maigaiti, while also engaged in design work. Many students reflected: "In the past, when listening to lectures, my mind was always not open. After contacting reality, it is not just listening to lectures, but coming to seek answers with a brain full of questions." When they saw the phenomenon of wheat seedlings dying in patches due to poor irrigation, which had never appeared in books, students from the Agronomy Department sought advice from teachers and friends, analyzed and discussed based on existing knowledge, and finally reached a consensus and immediately prescribed the right medicine, appropriately reducing the amount of stable manure, with good results. Although the course of entomology used to have specimens for observation, the species and colors of insects are ever-changing and vary with local seasons, water, and soil, so students initially found it difficult to learn and remember. However, after going to the site, due to personally observing the habits, hazards, changes, and prevention and control of insects, they not only memorized them firmly, but also were able to carry out timely and effective prevention and control of various pests. Precisely because of the equal emphasis on learning and doing, and applying what they have learned, academic performance has improved significantly. Students in the Agronomy Department have always found the rural course unfamiliar and difficult to understand. After on-site teaching, the situation has greatly changed. Of the one hundred and twenty people who took the exam, except for one person who scored three points, the entire department scored good and excellent. In the entomology exam, good and excellent scores were also above 94%. Secondly, through on-site teaching, teachers have made theory more closely integrated with specific problems in production, and the teaching materials have also been enriched. The Crop Cultivation course in the Agronomy Department found many problems on-site that were not mentioned in the books. Under the impetus of realistic conditions, teachers, based on existing knowledge and specific problems on-site, compiled a set of agronomy teaching materials including cultivation, seed selection, and cultivation along the order of local crop growth, which had both theory and perceptual materials, and absorbed the contents of general textbooks in the past and related to the specific problems in the Xinjiang region. It is easy for those who teach and easy for those who learn.
    Focusing on teaching and targeting important issues in production, teachers and students, together with farm workers and commune members, extensively launched mass scientific research activities, solving many problems for current production. More than 470 scientific research projects were completed this year, and the thirty-four students of the Farm 591 class alone wrote 59 scientific research papers of high standard and collected 119 valuable scientific research data. These scientific research works not only cultivated students' research abilities, enriched teaching content, and improved teaching quality, but also cooperated with production and solved many problems for production.
    Through on-site teaching, teachers and students have also improved their ideological awareness and strengthened their labor views. One hundred and fifteen of the one hundred and twenty students in the Agronomy Department were rewarded by the farm (commune). After this exercise, many teachers and students realized the superiority of the people's communes and the current excellent situation in the countryside, thereby motivating themselves and correcting their teaching and learning attitudes.

    课堂结合现场　理论联系实际
    现场教学教得透学得深
    八一农学院贯彻执行教育方针提高了教学质量
    本报讯　新疆八一农学院在执行教育和生产劳动相结合的方针中，取得显著成绩。他们采用现场教学的方法，使课堂紧密结合现场，理论联系实际，教学质量和科学研究工作都有很大提高。
    八一农学院是新疆军区生产建设兵团于1952年建立的。七年来，八一农学院已发展成包括六个系七个专业和拥有两千多名学生、三百五十多名教师的高等学府。它为新疆和内地部分省区已输送了三千七百多名毕业生。
    今年年初，为了更好地贯彻执行教育和生产劳动相结合的教育方针，根据上级的指示，结合学校情况，全院有八十二名教师和九百四十九名学生，分别下放到乌鲁木齐南山、呼图壁、乌拉乌苏、沙湾、塔城、阿克苏、喀什、托克逊和英吉沙等地农、林、牧场和人民公社。在劳动中，各班、级就二十八门课程从备课、讲课到讨论、实习以至成绩考核，进行了现场教学，收到显著成绩。在现场教学过程中，充分发扬了学校的光荣传统，在党委领导下，它们拟定了下乡阶段的教学计划。凡是属于观察、操作内容强或是在校内难以教好学好的课程，而生产单位条件又优于学校，就进行现场教学。其次，在思想上抓紧了改造，在业务上抓紧了实践，使现场教学结合师生的劳动锻炼，使教学计划配合场（社）业务计划，完满地保证了教学、实践、劳动很好吻合。春播前，讲播前整地、种子处理和播种方法，讲后即与农场工人、社员一块进行春播劳动。此外，还本着“农忙多劳动，农闲多学习”的精神，恰当地安排了教学和劳动的时间，保证了学做一致。
    通过现场教学，大大提高了教学质量。首先，学生结合理论学习，进行现场观察和实际操作，不仅增加了感性知识，巩固了理论知识，而且培养了独立思考和独立工作的能力，比如水利系学生莫铃荣在麦盖提就指挥几千人的渠道施工，同时兼搞设计工作。许多学生反映：
  “过去听课，总是思路不开，接触实际后再讲，就不单是听课，而是带着一脑子问题来求解答。”当他们看到从未在书本上出现的麦苗因灌溉不良而点片死亡的现象时，农学系学生就拜师访友，根据已有知识，分析讨论，最后取得一致意见，即刻对症下药，适当减少厩肥量，效果良好。昆虫学这门课程，过去虽有标本可供观察，但昆虫种色万千，并随当地季节、水土而变化无常，学生们开始觉得很难学，记不住。可是到了现场，由于对昆虫的习性、危害、变化和防治都亲自观察，结果不仅记牢了，而且还能对各种害虫作及时有效的防治。正因为学做并重、学以致用，学业成绩有了显著提高。农学系学生一向觉得农村课陌生难懂，经过现场教学后，情况大为改变，一百二十人参加考试，除一人得三分外，全系优良。昆虫学考试，优良成绩也在94％以上。其次，教师通过现场教学，使理论更结合了生产中的具体问题，教材也较前充实了。农学系作物栽培课，到了现场所发现的问题，不少在书中均只字未提，在现实条件促使下，教师根据已有的知识和现场的具体问题，沿着当地作物生长过程顺序，编出一套包括耕作、选种、栽培的农学教材，既有理论又有感性材料，既吸取了过去一般教材的内容，又联系了新疆地区的具体问题，教的人好教，学的人好学。
    围绕教学、针对生产中的重要问题，师生们与农场工人、社员一起，广泛展开了群众性的科学研究活动，给当前生产解决了不少难题。今年完成的科学研究项目达四百七十多个，仅农五九一班三十四个学生就写出了五十九篇水平较高的科学研究论文，收集一百一十九份宝贵的科学研究资料。这些科学研究工作，不仅培养了学生们的研究能力、充实了教学内容、提高了教学质量，而且配合生产，给生产解决了不少问题。
    通过现场教学，还使师生提高了思想觉悟，加强了劳动观点。农学系一百二十名学生就有一百一十五人受到场（社）奖励。好些师生经过这次锻炼，认清了人民公社的优越性和当前农村的大好形势，从而激励自己，端正了教学和学习态度。　（宋政厚）
