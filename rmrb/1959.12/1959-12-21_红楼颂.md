　　Ode to the Red Building
　　Yu Xintian

　　The red sun rises high in the sky, and under the brilliant sunshine, Yantan, the oasis in the heart of the Yellow River, appears even more verdant. Amidst the green trees, a corner of a red building is revealed, so bright and eye-catching that it comes into view from afar. That is the new commune members' dormitory building of the Yantan Commune, and it is precisely where I am heading now.

　　Farmers living in tall buildings is still a novelty in Gansu. As I walked towards Yantan, gazing from the south bank of the Yellow River at this red building nestled among the green trees, I couldn't help but quicken my pace, eager to visit it as soon as possible.

　　The area in front of the building was bustling with activity. To the right opposite the building was a row of livestock sheds. At this moment, a young man with a dark complexion—probably the keeper—was munching on a steamed bun while urging several tall, glossy mules to the canal for water. Next to the livestock sheds was a large open space. On the side nearest to the sheds were parked several trailers. A carpenter was building wooden frames on the trailers. Next to the trailers were piled up stacks of honey-yellow Lanzhou melons, crimson apples, purplish eggplants, bright red chili peppers, jade-green cabbages, golden corn... a truly dazzling array of colors. Several women were sorting them while chatting and laughing merrily. Further on was a row of sky-blue "Hotuo" twenty-five horsepower tractors, where several young workers were carefully cleaning them.

　　I found Secretary Liu of the Seventh Production Team. We walked to a pile of lumber in the open space and sat down. The three-story building stood before us, built entirely of red bricks. The bright glass windows, some with clean white curtains, some with open sashes, had pots of yellow chrysanthemums or pink hydrangeas on the sills. From some, you could even see New Year pictures pasted on the walls inside. I thought that each of these windows must hold some exciting stories! At this moment, Secretary Liu began to speak:

　　"Farmers living in tall buildings was just an ideal in the old society, and even during the time of advanced agricultural cooperatives. But after communization, the ideal has become a reality. Look at this building! It is a living example! Some people stare wide-eyed and clamor that 'the commune has messed things up,' but they just can't see this red building. Right now, this building can only house seventy households, and it can't include all commune members yet. Our cause is developing! Once we have this one, we will have ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand!"

　　Secretary Liu's eyes shone with intense light, looking at me as if asking, "Are you right?" These were such profound and philosophical words! My heart burned with his passionate language.

　　"Communization has indeed made people's eyes brighter and strengthened their confidence in taking the socialist road." Secretary Liu continued, "Although Yantan has fertile land, it was all controlled by landlords and merchants in the past. You must be clear about what kind of days we poor people lived in the old society. Take Wei Zhi's family in Yantan, for example. A single cotton-padded jacket became a family heirloom, worn by the grandfather, then the father, and then passed on to him, and he wore it until liberation. And what kind of houses did they live in? 'Hide-your-head houses,' barely enough to cover their heads. Now look at what our commune members wear, what they eat, and where they live. This is all thanks to the path pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao! And listen to what old man Wang Shuhuai said. At one meeting, he said: 'When they promoted living in tall buildings right after liberation, we thought it was idle talk. When they promoted living in tall buildings after the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, we thought we would probably never live in one in our lifetime. But unexpectedly, we really moved into a tall building today! We no longer have to worry about strong winds and heavy rains. Looking at the white walls, the shining glass windows, the bright electric lights at night, and eating in the canteen, if it weren't for the good leadership of Chairman Mao, how could Wang Shuhuai have such happy days!' This very same old man, who comes from a poor peasant background and is over sixty years old, took his steamed bun and automatically threw himself into the army digging the fish pond the day after moving into the building, and no one could stop him!"

　　Secretary Liu's introduction of old man Wang Shuhuai's words tightly gripped my heartstrings. I have heard similar words from peasants like old man Wang at many meetings. Every time I hear such words—these ordinary, simple, and completely heartfelt words—I feel equally fresh and intimate. I will be excited by the enormous changes in life reflected in those words! Old man Wang's words eloquently demonstrate how deeply the path of communization has taken root in the hearts of the peasants! At this moment, I couldn't help but say to Secretary Liu:

　　"Let's go and see old man Wang Shuhuai's home!"

　　"You can't expect to find old man Wang at home now!" Although Secretary Liu said this, he still led me towards old man Wang's home.

　　Old man Wang Shuhuai's family has a total of five people, including his old wife and three children. According to Secretary Liu, his eldest child has already found a partner and is about to get married. When we arrived at Wang Shuhuai's home, no one was there. Even though the host was not there, we still fully enjoyed admiring their new house. It was two rooms inside and out. Just as old man Wang Shuhuai said, white walls, bright glass windows, and electric lights hanging high. Inside, there was a double bed, covered with brand-new floral-striped sheets, with two neatly folded satin-faced new quilts on the bed. There were also two new chests at the head of the bed, and several new paintings on the wall. It was completely decorated for a wedding. In the outer room, there was a large bed, one end covered with felt and the other with a patched coarse cloth sheet. Several quilts were placed against the wall on the bed. A thermos and some jars and bottles were placed on the eight immortals table. Some small tools were also standing in the corner of the wall. From the furnishings of this room, traces of past life were still revealed, but they were all cleaned up neatly, overflowing with the owner's love for today's life. On the center of the wall above the Eight Immortals table, there was a pink silk cloth. I curiously opened it to see that there was a picture of Chairman Mao underneath!

　　At this moment, a cadre came to find Secretary Liu. Secretary Liu said to me: "It's time to go to the meeting. The team is discussing plans for accumulating fertilizer and deep plowing. Everyone is very enthusiastic! You can walk around by yourself!"

　　Secretary Liu left, and I also walked out of the building. A busy scene presented itself before me again....

　　I thought about this three-story red building bathed in sunshine. Was this an ordinary building? No, this is not an ordinary building. I thought about the changes in old man Wang Shuhuai's life that I saw with my own eyes. Were these ordinary changes? No, these are not ordinary changes! I thought of those people full of energy that I had seen in the past few days, surging towards the fields before the work bell rang, and slowly returning long after the work bell rang at night. I also thought of those poetic figures I saw at the commune party committee meeting: the per mu yield of vegetables on the upper crop reached 5,400 jin, an increase of 29.97% compared to the same period in 1958, and striving to exceed 10,000 jin per mu for the lower crop; the total income of the entire commune in 1958 was more than 4.28 million yuan, an increase of 21.4% compared to 1957 before communization... All of this made me associate it with this building and the changes in old man Wang Shuhuai's life! Isn't this clear? It is communization that has allowed production to develop. On the basis of the great development of production and the increase of public accumulation, this building was born, and this building has illuminated the eyes of so many people! It has made them see how ideals have turned into today's reality, and it has given them more energy to leap forward with a more heroic pace in the direction pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao!

　　Thinking, thinking, I had already walked to the colorful and splendid fields, and laughter and singing came from my ears. I turned my head occasionally and saw the corner of the red building nestled among the green trees again. It was so bright and dazzling! Despite the slander and curses of domestic and foreign enemies and right-leaning opportunists, our people's commune is being increasingly consolidated and strengthened; hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of red buildings are rising in the vast countryside of the motherland...

　　红楼颂
　　于辛田
    红日升上了高空，在灿烂的阳光照耀下，这黄河中心的绿洲——雁滩，越发显得青翠了。在绿树丛中，露出了一角红楼，是那么的鲜明夺目，老远就映进了你的眼帘。那是雁滩公社新盖的社员宿舍大楼，也正是我现在要去的地方。
    农民住大楼，在甘肃来说，还是一件新鲜事儿。当我在走向雁滩的途中，从黄河的南岸遥遥望见了这座掩映在绿树丛中的红楼，便不由得加快了脚步，想赶快先去把它参观一下。
    大楼前面充满一片繁忙景象。大楼对面右首，是一排牲口棚，这时，一个脸膛黑黑的小伙子——大概是饲养员吧，正一边啃着馍馍，一边吆着几匹毛色油光的高头大骡子，前往渠边饮水；牲口棚的旁边是一大片空场，靠牲口棚这头放着几辆拖车，木匠正往拖车上作木架，拖车旁堆满了鹅黄色的兰州瓜，胭脂色的大苹果，紫茸茸的茄子，红通通的大辣椒，碧玉色的莲花白，金黄的大玉米……真是五光十色，绚烂多彩，几个妇女一边在整理着，一边笑嘻嘻的谈的很热闹。再过去便是一排天蓝色的“热托”二十五马力的拖拉机，几个年青工人，正在那里细心擦洗。
    我找到第七生产队的刘书记。我们走向空场上的一堆木料，坐了下来。三层大楼矗立在眼前，因为大楼全是用红砖盖的。那一扇扇明亮的玻璃窗，有的挂着洁白的窗帘，有的窗扇打开着，窗台上放着一盆盆黄的菊花或粉红的绣球花，有的还可以望到屋内墙上贴的年画。我想着这每一个窗口内，都会有着一些激动人心的故事啊！这时，刘书记开了腔：
    “农民住大楼，不要说在旧社会，就是在高级农业社的时候，也只是理想；可是公社化后理想实现了。看看这座大楼吧！这就是活生生的例子！有些人瞪着眼睛嚷叫什么‘公社搞糟了’，他就是看不见这座红色大楼。眼下，这座大楼只能住七十户，还不能把全部社员都包下来。我们的事业是发展的呀，有了这一座，就会有十座、百座、千座、万座！”
    刘书记的眼睛里射出了强烈的光芒，注视着我好像是在问我：“你说对吗？”这是多么深刻、多么富有哲理的语言啊！我的心为他那炽热的语言燃烧起来。
    “公社化确实把人们的眼睛照得越发亮了，使人们走社会主义大道的信心越发坚定了。”刘书记继续说了下去。“雁滩上虽然有着肥沃的土地，过去可都把持在地主、商人手里。旧社会咱们苦人过的啥样日月，你一定也很亮清。就以雁滩上魏志家来说吧，一件棉袄成了传家宝，爷爷穿了爹穿，爹穿了又传给他，他一直穿到解放；住的呢，是‘藏头房’，仅仅能把头遮住。现在你再看看，咱社员穿的什么，吃的什么，住的什么，这都是党和毛主席指的路啊！你再听听王树槐老汉的话。一次会上他说：‘刚解放时宣传住大楼，咱认为那是闲扯呢。成立了农业社时宣传住大楼，咱心里思想咱这辈子怕住不上了。可想不到咱今天真的搬上了大楼！咱再不犯愁刮黄风，下暴雨了。望望那白生生的墙，明晃晃的玻璃窗，晚上电灯亮堂堂，吃饭进食堂，要不是毛主席他老人家领导的好，咱王树槐那有这幸福日月啊！就是这位已六十多岁贫农出身的社员，搬进大楼的第二天，拿上馒头，便自动的投到挖鱼池的大军中去了，谁也拉不住！”
    刘书记介绍王树槐老汉说的那一番话，紧紧的扣住了我的心弦。我在不少会上，听到过像王老汉这样的庄稼人说出的意思大致相同的话。每次听到这样的话，——这平凡而朴实、完全发自内心的话，我都感到同样新鲜、亲切，我都会为那些话里面所反映出的生活中的巨大变化而激动！王老汉的话，雄辩地说明了公社化的道路，在农民心中扎下了多么深的根！这时，我禁不住向刘书记说：
    “走，咱们到王树槐老汉家中去看看！”
    “现在，你可别想能在家里把王老汉找着！”刘书记虽然这样说，但还是领着我向王老汉家中走去。
    王树槐老汉家里共有五口人，除了他的老伴，还有三个孩子。据刘书记介绍，他的老大已找到了对象，就要结婚了。我们到了王树槐家中，果然一个人都没有。主人不在，我们还是尽情的把他们的新房欣赏了一番。这是里外两间，正像王树槐老汉说的，白生生的墙，明晃晃的玻璃窗，电灯高高的挂着。里间支着一张双人床，床上铺着崭新的花条单子，床上放着两床叠的整整齐齐的缎面子的新棉被，床头还放着两口新箱子，墙上贴着几张新画儿，完全是办喜事的样子。外屋里是一张大床，一头铺的是毡，一头是有着补绽的粗布单子，床上靠墙放着几床被子，一张八仙桌上放着暖水瓶和一些瓶瓶罐罐，靠墙角还竖着一些小工具，从这间房子的陈设上，还留露着过去生活的痕迹，但却都收拾的干干净净，洋溢着主人对今天生活的热爱。在八仙桌上面的墙中央，挂着一块粉红色的绸子，我好奇的揭开一看，下面是一张毛主席像！
    这时，一个干部找刘书记来了。刘书记向我说道：“该去开会了，队上正在讨论积肥、深翻的计划哩。大伙的心劲可大了！你一个人再转转吧！”
    刘书记走了，我也走出了大楼。眼前又呈现出一片忙碌景象……。
    我想着这座披满阳光的三层红色大楼，这是一座平常大楼吗？不，这不是一座平常大楼；我想着亲眼看见的王树槐老汉生活中的变化，这是寻常的变化吗？不，这不是寻常的变化！我想到这几天看见的那些干劲冲天的人们上工钟还没响，便涌向了田间，晚上下工钟响了很久，才缓缓的归来；我更想到在公社党委会看到的那些富有诗意的数目字，今年上槎蔬菜亩产达五千四百斤，比1958年同期增长29.97％多，力争下槎亩产超过万斤；1958年全社共收入四百二十八万多元，比公社化前的1957年增长21.4％，……这一切都使我联想到这座大楼，王树槐老汉生活的变化！这还不清楚吗？是公社化使生产得到了发展，在生产大发展，公共积累增加的基础上，诞生了这座大楼，而这座大楼又照亮了多少人的眼睛啊！使他们看到了理想怎样的变成了今天的现实，使他们更有了心劲，以更豪迈的步伐向前、向着党和毛主席指的方向跃进！
    想着，想着，我已走到那彩色绚烂的田野，耳旁传来一片欢笑和歌声。我偶一回头，又望到了那掩映在绿树丛中的一角红楼，它是多么的鲜明耀眼！尽管国内、外敌人和右倾机会主义分子在污蔑咒诅，但我们的人民公社正日益巩固、壮大；正有百座、千座、万座红楼，在祖国广大的农村中升起……
