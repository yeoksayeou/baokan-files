Dehui Takes Measures to Improve Leadership Methods and Strengthen Grassroots Forces
Strengthening the Core Role of Rural Branches

(Our report) Strengthening the political and ideological work and organizational construction of grassroots party organizations, and enhancing the combat effectiveness of rural branches, is an important experience of the Dehui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in leading production. This measure has powerfully guaranteed the implementation of the Party's various policies and guidelines, and has brought about a new leap forward in various production and work aspects.

In the great leap forward of socialist construction and the people's commune movement last year, the rural Party organizations of Dehui County played a strong leading role, and the broad masses of Party members demonstrated abundant revolutionary drive. However, in this huge transformation, because some Party grassroots organizations and Party members failed to quickly adapt to the new situation in terms of ideology, work, and leadership methods, some problems arose. For example, some grassroots Party organizations, because they were once mired in bureaucracy, often only grasped specific production details, neglecting political and ideological work, which made some grassroots Party organizations lack combat effectiveness. After discovering these problems, the Dehui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has taken a series of measures over the past six months to change this style of work, while vigorously strengthening the Party's grassroots work. First, the County Committee took the lead and mobilized Party organizations at all levels to check and criticize the phenomenon of not grasping the Party's political and ideological work from top to bottom, level by level; then, it organized all Party members to repeatedly and conscientiously study the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, to enhance everyone's understanding of the importance of the Party's work. The County Committee also used various meetings to carry out propaganda and education, requiring Party members and cadres to do a good job in Party work while doing a good job in central work and professional work. As a result, the Party committees of each commune have included strengthening the Party's grassroots work on the agenda of the Party committee, regularly conduct research, and strengthen leadership.

While taking these measures, the County Committee also used various methods to cultivate and improve the communist consciousness of Party members and the organizational leadership abilities of cadres. The County Committee Party School has planned to rotate training for rural Party members throughout the county, and nearly six hundred people have been trained in batches so far. Party school teachers also went to the countryside to give Party lectures. The Party committees of each commune have adhered to regular Party lessons and strengthened organizational life. Through these practices, Party members are educated in communism, basic Party knowledge, and the Party's current policies, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and further give play to the exemplary and leading role of Party members. The County Committee also organized leading cadres of branches to visit and exchange experiences in branch work, held on-site meetings, and strengthened cadres' theoretical studies, which improved the leadership level of grassroots cadres.

In order to promote an all-round leap forward, the Dehui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party paid special attention to grasping the weak branch as the central link. In addition to assigning some County Committee members to take charge of the work of several weak branches throughout the year, in various tasks, they sent capable work teams to specifically help with the work. The Party committees of each commune were all taken charge of by the deputy secretary of the Party committee or a stronger Party committee member to take charge of the weak management areas. The County Committee also adjusted and dispatched cadres to strengthen the leadership of weak areas. Since 1958, the county has dispatched more than one hundred and seventy stronger cadres to serve as leaders in communes and management areas; each management area has also transferred two hundred and ninety-four Party members to weak production teams. This has greatly strengthened the strength of the Party's grassroots organizations in weak areas. For example, Guo Jia, Mi Shazi, Zhu Chengzi and other people's communes were originally relatively weak communes in their work. After taking these measures to strengthen leadership, the role of branches and Party members has been greatly enhanced, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has been unprecedentedly high, and they have quickly leaped to become advanced communes.

In terms of leadership methods, the County Committee also used the mass line methods of grasping both ends to bring along the middle, on-site meetings, and evaluation and competition to guide and promote the Party's grassroots work. For example, this summer, the County Committee held an on-site meeting in Guo Jia People's Commune, introducing the practice of the Guo Jia Commune Party Committee of grasping typical examples and using the different results of strengthening Party work and neglecting Party work to educate all Party members. After the meeting, the Party committees of each commune universally promoted the practice of the Guo Jia Commune Party Committee, which powerfully promoted the development of grassroots organizational work and improved the level of branch work. In the production movements of spring plowing, summer hoeing, exceeding contracted production, and autumn harvest, different contents of evaluation and competition were carried out everywhere. Through evaluation, examples were established, and a wave of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced was set off.

Now, the combat effectiveness of the rural Party organizations in Dehui County has been significantly strengthened. The leadership level of grassroots organizations has been greatly improved, and the leadership role and methods have been greatly improved. The communist consciousness of Party members has been greatly improved, and they have played an exemplary and leading role in various movements and production and work. For example, the Shengyang Management Area branch of Shuangmiaozi Commune has a clear division of labor in its actual work, and has implemented the leadership methods of branch committee members taking charge of Party groups, Party groups taking charge of areas, and Party members taking charge of teams. All important tasks are discussed at branch committee meetings and branch general meetings to concentrate the wisdom of Party members. During the autumn harvest, the branch held a branch committee meeting and put forward a plan to lead the autumn harvest movement. Then, it held a general meeting of Party members to organize Party members to seriously discuss and make a resolution, immediately setting off a high tide of the autumn harvest movement, making the autumn harvest done quickly and well. The number of such good rural branches in the county has increased to 83.7%, and the number of poor branches has been reduced by half. Under the leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations, the masses are full of energy, and in various tasks, a situation of everyone striving to be upstream and everyone striving to be a model has emerged. This has resulted in this year's agricultural output increasing by 35.74% compared to last year, and sideline income has reached 12.5 million yuan as of September (last year's income was 3 million yuan), and other industries have also achieved new leaps forward.

    德惠采取措施改进领导方法充实基层力量
    加强农村支部核心作用
    本报讯　加强基层党组织的政治思想工作和组织建设工作，提高农村支部的战斗力，是中共吉林省德惠县委员会领导生产的重要经验。这一措施有力地保证了党的各项方针政策的贯彻执行，使各项生产和工作出现了新的跃进局面。
    德惠县农村党的组织在去年社会主义建设大跃进和人民公社化运动中，发挥了坚强的领导作用，广大党员表现了充沛的革命干劲。但是在这一巨大的变革中，由于有些党的基层组织和党员在思想上、工作上和领导方法上，未能很快适应新的形势，曾经产生一些问题。例如有的基层党组织因为一度陷于事务主义，往往只抓具体的生产细节，忽视了政治工作和思想工作，这就使有些党的基层组织缺乏战斗力。中共德惠县委发现这些问题后，半年多来，采取了一系列措施改变这种工作作风，同时大力加强党的基层工作。首先，县委以身作则，发动各级党的组织，自上而下，层层检查和批判不抓党的政治思想工作的现象；接着又组织全体党员反复认真学习党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，提高大家对党的工作的重要性的认识。县委还利用各种会议进行宣传教育，要求党员干部在做好中心工作和业务工作同时，必须做好党的工作。由此，各公社党委都把加强党的基层工作列入党委的工作日程，定期进行研究，加强了领导。
    在采取这些措施的同时，县委还采用各种办法培养提高党员的共产主义觉悟和干部的组织领导能力。县委党校有计划地轮训全县农村党员，到现在已经分批轮训了近六百人。党校教员还下乡上党课。各公社党委都坚持了经常的党课教育，并且加强了组织生活。通过这些做法，对党员进行共产主义、党的基本知识和当前党的方针政策的教育，开展批评与自我批评，进一步发挥了党员的模范带头作用。县委还组织支部领导干部参观，交流支部工作经验，召开现场会议，以及加强干部理论学习等，提高了基层干部的领导水平。
    为了促进全面跃进，中共德惠县委特别注意抓住薄弱支部这个中心环节。除确定一些县委委员常年包干几个薄弱支部的工作外，在各项工作中，都派得力的工作组具体帮助工作。各公社党委都由党委副书记或较强的党委委员包干薄弱管理区。县委还调整和下派干部，充实薄弱地区的领导力量。全县从1958年以来共下派了一百七十多个较强的干部，到公社和管理区担任领导工作；各管理区也抽调了二百九十四名党员到薄弱生产队。这样就大大加强了薄弱地区党基层组织的力量。如郭家、米沙子、朱城子等人民公社原来都是工作比较薄弱的公社，在采取了这些措施加强了领导后，支部和党员的作用大大增强，群众生产情绪空前高涨，很快跃为先进的公社。
    在领导方法上，县委还运用抓两头带中间、现场会议、评比竞赛等群众路线的方法，指导和推动党的基层工作。如今年夏季县委在郭家人民公社召开现场会，介绍了郭家公社党委抓取典型，用加强党的工作和忽视党的工作的不同结果，来教育全体党员。会后，各公社普遍推广郭家公社党委的做法，有力地促进了基层组织工作的开展，提高了支部工作水平。在春耕、夏锄、超包产和秋收等生产运动中，各地都开展了不同内容的评比竞赛。通过评比，树立榜样，掀起了学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮。
    现在，德惠县农村党组织的战斗力已经显著加强。基层组织领导水平有很大提高，领导作用和方法有很大改进。党员的共产主义觉悟大大提高，在各项运动和生产、工作中起了模范、带头作用。比如双庙子公社升阳管理区支部在实际工作中都有明确分工，实行了支委包党小组，党小组包片，党员包队的领导方法。凡是较重要的工作都开支委会、支部大会讨论，集中党员的智慧。秋收时，支部召开了支委会，提出了领导秋收运动的计划。然后召开了党员大会，组织党员认真讨论，做出决议，立即掀起秋收运动高潮，使秋收做得又快又好。全县类似这样较好的农村支部已增加到83.7％，较差的支部减少了一半。在党的基层组织领导下，群众干劲十足，在各项工作中，都出现了人人争上游，个个争模范的局面。这样就使今年农业产量比去年增加了35.74％，副业收入截至9月份的统计即已达一千二百五十万元（去年收入三百万元），其他各业也都获得了新的跃进。
