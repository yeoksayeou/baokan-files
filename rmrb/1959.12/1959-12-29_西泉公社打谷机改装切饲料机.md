　　Xiquan Commune Converts Threshing Machine into Fodder Cutter

　　(Our report) In the massive drive to ensile green fodder, the Xiquan People's Commune in Tongliang County, Sichuan, successfully converted a threshing machine into a fodder chopper. Two people can chop 8,000 jin of green fodder in a day, increasing efficiency by eight to ten times compared to manual labor.

　　The advantages of converting a machine to chop green fodder are: First, high work efficiency and labor saving. Each tool only requires two people to operate, one to feed the material and one to crank it. According to measurements, 800 jin of sweet potato vines can be chopped in one hour, which is eight to ten times more efficient than manual chopping; second, the chopped fodder is of appropriate thickness and good quality. The length of the chopped fodder is about 0.5 to 1 inch, and the quality meets the requirements; third, the conversion is easy, the cost is low, and the utilization rate of the machinery is improved. It only takes three or four workers and costs only about ten yuan; fourth, it is easy to use and does not pick and choose fodder. It can chop both green and dry fodder.

　　The conversion method is: First, move the original roller position, and move the roller on the side of the threshing machine frame to the center of the wooden frame; second, add blades to the iron disc blocking the roller head. Remove four wooden strips from the roller, and add four knives to the flatter inner side of the iron disc at the other end of the hand crank. The knives should be 34 cm long, 5 cm wide, and 5 mm thick, and the cutting edge should be sharp and shaped like scissors. Drill two holes at one end of the blade, and fix it on the square hole of the iron disc blocking the roller head with 4-fen screws; third, add a feeding hopper. At the end where the blades are installed, fix the hopper to the wooden side of the threshing machine frame with wood screws. The hopper has a large inlet and a small outlet, and the side wall of the hopper is low in the front and high in the back. Add a sloping wooden cover at the front to ensure uniform feeding. The hopper outlet must be closely matched with the blade opening; fourth, add four legs to the threshing machine frame. Clamp the original frame on four wooden pillars and tighten them with wooden bolts or screws to prevent shaking.

　　西泉公社打谷机改装切饲料机
    本报讯　四川铜梁县西泉人民公社在大抓青贮饲料中，用打谷机改装成功饲料切碎机，两人一天可铡青饲料八千斤，比人工提高效率八至十倍。
    改装青贮饲料切碎机的优点是：一、工效高，节省劳动力。每台工具只需二人操作，一人喂料，一人摇转。据测定，一点钟就铡了红苕藤八百斤，比人工切工效高八至十倍；二、粗细合适，质量好。饲料铡的长短在五分到一市寸左右，质量符合要求；三、改装容易，成本低廉，提高了机具的利用率。用工不过三、四个，成本只需十元左右；四、使用方便，不择饲料。既能铡青饲料，又能铡干饲料。
    改装的方法是：一、移动原来滚筒位置，将打谷机机架边上的滚筒移至木方架的中央；二、在滚筒挡头铁盘上加上刀片。在滚筒上拆下四根木条，在手摇的另一端铁盘较平的里面加上四把刀，刀长三十四厘米，宽五厘米，厚五毫米，刀口要锋利，做成剪刀口形。刀片的一端钻两个眼，用四分螺丝固定在滚筒挡头铁盘的方孔上；三、加喂料斗。在安有刀片一端，将料斗用木螺钉固定在打谷机机架的木方上。料斗进口大出口小，料斗边墙前低后高，前端加上有斜度的木盖子，使喂料时送量均匀一致。料斗出口要与刀口密接配合好；四、给打谷机机架加四条腿。将原有机架卡在四条木柱子上，用木拴或螺钉拴紧，免得摆动。
