    A Eulogy to the Heroes of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    ——After Viewing the Play "Long Live the Heroes"
    Wei Wei
    In history, only the heroic feats of the people are truly immortal. Therefore, it will always be a creative theme for literature and art.
    The War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea is one of the significant heroic feats of the Chinese people. Although this war has been over for six years, the dust of history has not diminished its color at all. Recently, the premiere of Comrade Du Feng's new work "Long Live the Heroes" deeply moved the audience, once again illustrating that using the heroic feats of the people to educate and inspire them to advance is one of the most important aspects of our proletarian literature.
    The summer and autumn of 1952 was the season when the Chinese People's Volunteers were fiercely battling the enemy on solidified positions. At that time, our broad masses had already created the "Underground Great Wall" connecting the east and west coasts. This was the crystallization of mass wisdom and the most brilliant example of applying the Party's mass line to military struggle. However, could this "Underground Great Wall" actually stop the enemy's offensive? Could the enemy, with its superior equipment, break through our defense line under the impact of superior forces? The decisive factor was still people, the people who held the positions. After the Korean armistice, didn't the enemy also learn from us and build tunnel fortifications? However, our army's summer offensive campaign in 1953 penetrated the enemy's line by dozens of kilometers, annihilating over 100,000 enemy troops, and the enemy's tunnels turned into advantageous defensive positions for our army. On the other hand, our army, under the same circumstances, relied on tunnels to create amazing miracles, preventing the enemy's heavy troops from advancing even a step. One of the miracles was that even when the enemy had occupied our surface positions, the positions had not been lost, the battle had not ended, and the enemy still could not advance because our people were still fighting beneath their feet. Who has ever seen such a battle? This is not found in any military textbook, and it is the best illustration of the combination of courage and wisdom of the Chinese People's Army. "Long Live the Heroes" extracts such material, and through the heroic struggle of a small unit defending tunnels beneath the enemy's feet, it reveals the great hearts of the heroes. This is a song of praise, full of enthusiasm, for the heroes of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.
    The play's depiction of life on the Korean battlefield is realistic, with a relatively strong atmosphere of life; and it runs through the author's full patriotism and internationalism from beginning to end; the characters in the play, especially several soldiers, are lively, vivid, and full of humor. This is the main success of the work. The author worked in the army for a long time and lived on the Korean front line, among his heroes, for a year. Without this personal experience, such a work could not have been written. Speaking of the shortcomings of the work, perhaps the main one is that it still lacks further concentration and refinement in terms of art. Many characters in the play have a good foundation in their personalities, but not enough attention has been paid to grasping a few of them and giving them more full and profound development. The relationships between the characters have also not been constructed more clearly and closely. Of course, talking about concentration and refinement is a bit "easier said than done," but we must solve this problem in order to raise our works to a higher level.
    This play was performed by the comrades of the Beijing People's Art Theater with great enthusiasm. It is said that Director Mei Qian and the actors, in order to make up for their lack of experience in military life, personally went to the front-line troops in Fujian to observe and experience life before rehearsing, and also invited military cadres to train their military movements. Therefore, although this was their first time performing a military play, judging from the performance effect, it can be said that they achieved great success. Among them, Comrade Ma Qun, who played the battalion commander, Comrade Dong Chao, who played the political commissar, Comrade Ying Ruocheng, who played the regimental commander, Comrade Li Xiang, who played the platoon leader, Comrade Tong Di, who played the communications soldier, and Comrade Lin Liankun, who played the soldier Ma Wenming, all performed quite successfully. Comrade Diao Guangqin, who played the division commander, performed very well, but seemed to lack a bit of the temperament of a military cadre. In addition, in some specific treatments by the director, there are still places that lack a sense of reality. For example, whenever subordinates accept tasks, it is always "Yes, yes," "Resolutely complete the task!" It seems very powerful, but in fact it is a bit rigid, and it is easy to generalize the unique features of the characters, and it does not conform to the unique customs of our army. Secondly, the characters' costumes are too new and too neat (the division commander is still wearing leather shoes), which also reduces the unique color of the battle. Despite these small shortcomings, as a member of the army, seeing the comrades of the Beijing People's Art Theater reproducing the great image of the Volunteer Army with great enthusiasm is very gratifying. I believe that the performance of "Long Live the Heroes" can give a very strong encouragement to the comrades who are in the upsurge of production, because our Volunteer Army warriors, in those years of hard struggle, were already the best example of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    一曲抗美援朝英雄的赞歌
    ——话剧“英雄万岁”观后
    魏巍
    在历史上，只有人民的英雄伟绩，才是真正不朽的事物。因此，它也会永远是文学艺术的创作主题。
    抗美援朝战争，是中国人民重大的英雄伟绩之一。这个战争，虽然已经过去了六年，但是历史的风尘，一点也没有减失它的彩色。最近，杜烽同志的新作“英雄万岁”上演后，使观众深受感动，又一次说明，运用人民的英雄伟绩来教育人民、鼓舞人民的前进，是我们无产阶级文学的一个最重要的方面。
    1952年夏秋，正是中国人民志愿军在巩固的阵地上与敌人进行鏖战的季节。当时我军广大群众已经创造了连接东西海岸的“地下长城”。这是群众智慧的结晶，是党的群众路线运用在军事斗争方面的最辉煌的例子。但是，这道“地下长城”，究竟能不能阻住敌人的进攻呢？敌人挟其优势装备，在优势兵力冲击下能不能突破我们的防线呢？决定的因素仍然是人，是据守阵地的人。在朝鲜停战后，敌人不是也学我们的样子搞了坑道工事吗？可是我军1953年的夏季进攻战役，一举就突入敌阵几十公里，歼敌十余万人，敌人的坑道反而变做我军有利的防御阵地。而我军却在同样情况下，依托坑道，创造了惊人的奇迹，使敌军重兵不能前进一步。奇迹之一，就是当敌人已经占领了我军表面阵地的时候，而阵地并未失守，战斗并未终止，敌人依然不能前进，因为我们的人仍然战斗在敌人的脚下。谁见过这样的战例？这是一切军事教科书中所没有的，这是中国人民军队勇敢与智慧相结合的最好说明。“英雄万岁”，就是采撷了这样的素材，通过一支坚守坑道的小部队在敌人脚下的英勇斗争，揭示了英雄们的伟大心灵。这是一曲对抗美援朝的英雄们满腔热忱的赞歌。
    剧作对朝鲜战场生活的描写是真实的，具有比较浓厚的生活气息；而且从头到尾都贯穿了作者饱满的爱国主义和国际主义的激情；剧里的几个人物，尤其是几个战士生动活泼而饶有风趣。这是作品主要成功的地方。作者长期工作在部队中，并且在朝鲜前线，在他的英雄们中间生活了一年。假若没有这种亲身感受，是写不出这样的作品来的。说起作品的不足之处，恐怕主要是在艺术上还缺少进一步的集中和提炼。剧本中不少人物的性格都有很好的基础，但是没有狠狠抓住几个，给予更充分的、更深刻的发挥。人物之间的关系也没有构成得更加明晰和紧密。当然，谈到集中，谈到提炼，是有点儿“说时容易做时难”的，但是我们必须解决这个问题，才能使我们的作品提到更高的水平。
    这个剧作，是北京人民艺术剧院的同志们怀着很高的热情演出的。听说导演梅阡同志和演员同志们，为了弥补部队生活经验的不足，在排演前，曾亲自到福建前线部队中观察体验，还请了部队干部来训练自己的军事动作。因此，虽说他们是第一次演出部队戏，从演出效果看，可以说获得了很大的成功。其中饰演营长的马群同志，饰演政委的董超同志，饰演团长的英若诚同志，饰演排长的李翔同志，饰演通讯员的童弟同志以及饰演战士马文明的林连昆同志都演得相当成功。饰演师长的刁光覃同志，演得很好，只是似乎还缺一点军事干部的气质。此外，在导演的某些具体处理上，也还有缺少真实感的地方。例如每逢下级接受任务时，总是“是、是”、“坚决完成任务！”，看来很有气势，实际上有些刻板，容易使人物的独特风貌一般化，而且也不符合我军特有的习俗。其次，人物的服装太新，也太整齐（师长还穿着皮鞋），也减少了战斗中特有的采色。尽管有这些小缺点，作为部队的一个成员，看到北京人民艺术剧院同志们以很高的热情来重现志愿军的伟大形象，是叫人十分高兴的。我相信“英雄万岁”的上演，能给正在生产高潮中的同志们一个极有力的鼓舞，因为我们的志愿军勇士们，在那艰苦斗争的年代，就已经是鼓足干劲、力争上游的最好榜样。
