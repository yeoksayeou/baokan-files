    Fine Work with Coarse Materials, Promoting Fattening of Pigs
    Jiaoxie Management Area in Weinan County Uses Wild Grasses and Leaves to Raise Fat Pigs
    Xianfeng Management Area in Pixian County Releases Fat Pigs Three Months Earlier Than in the Past
    Our newspaper, Xi'an, 3rd dispatch: Jiaoxie Management Area of Gushi People's Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, vigorously innovates pig-raising methods, using wild grasses and leaves to fatten pigs, and has gained rich experience.
    From January to October this year, this management area sold a total of 3,084 fat pigs to the state. These fat pigs were mainly fattened with wild grass, leaves, alfalfa, and various crop stalks and leaves.
    Jiaoxie Management Area has tested various wild vegetables, leaves, and crop stalks and leaves, proving that they contain sufficient nutrients. They meticulously process the collected wild grass, leaves, and various crop stalks and leaves: chop the green fodder; crush the dry leaves and vines with a stone roller and sift them through a sieve; the fodder for piglets is ground and sifted through a sieve, and processed and stored separately. When feeding, they mix and match according to the nutritional content and taste of various fodders, and change the variety frequently to prevent the pigs from eating the same food repeatedly. All fodder is cooked in a pot, the bitter water is drained out, and warm boiled water is added when feeding; acidic or sugary fodder is also fermented to increase nutritional content.
    The feeding methods are also diverse. For example, the feeding method varies depending on the season and the size of the pig. In summer, the feed is thinner, and in winter, it is thicker; the feed for piglets and meat pigs is thicker, and the feed for feeder pigs is thinner. Different fodders are also fed according to the nutritional needs of each growth stage of the pig (piglets, feeder pigs, and meat pigs). Only some bran and wheat bran are fed during the fattening period.
    This management area has discovered more than two hundred kinds of wild grasses, leaves, and crop stalks and leaves that pigs can eat. In one fodder collection campaign in September and October, the entire management area collected more than 5.51 million catties of dry fodder. The 8,592 pigs currently kept in the pens in the entire management area average 641 catties per head.
    Recently, the Weinan County Party Committee summarized the experience of this management area in fattening pigs with wild grasses, leaves, and branches and leaves of various crops, and specially organized a lecturer group to travel around the province with a large number of wild feed specimens to explain and exhibit, and promote their advanced experience.

    Our newspaper, Chengdu, 3rd dispatch: Xianfeng Management Area of Xianfeng Commune in Pixian County produces fat pigs with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    In the past year, the number of pigs in Xianfeng Management Area increased by 71.1% (currently 2,300 pigs in pens), and the fattening speed has accelerated. Of the 1,524 piglets kept in pens at the end of last year, 93% had been fattened into fat pigs by November. The average weight of these pigs leaving the pens is about 150 catties, the time of leaving the pens is three months earlier than in the past, and the cost is significantly reduced.
    The key to the rapid development and fattening of pigs in Xianfeng Management Area lies in giving full play to the superiority of the commune and conscientiously implementing the policy of "collective breeding as the main method, with public and private breeding coexisting." In terms of specific methods, the entire management area has established fourteen feeding command posts, each of which cultivates some "satellite pigs" to guide the overall fattening work. Around the feeding command posts, and taking the canteens as units, fifty-two fattening pig pens have been established. All piglets are sent to the fattening pig pens for feeding after they grow into feeder pigs. The main methods of fattening are:
    ① Feeding regularly and quantitatively, carefully matching the feed when feeding, achieving a combination of various feeds, fine feeding of coarse materials, adding flavor to fine materials, coarse first and then fine, thin first and then thick, chopping coarsely and cooking thoroughly, moderate temperature, adding while eating, feeding evenly and fully;
    ② Using drugs to promote fattening. In the past year, eleven methods of promoting fattening have been adopted, such as injecting milk needles and cutting the thyroid gland. The most effective method is to inject self-made traditional Chinese medicine fattening elements; pigs injected with this fattening element grow six ounces to half a catty more meat per day than those not injected;
    ③ Strengthening disease prevention and hygiene work. In addition to giving vaccinations, regular bathing and disinfection of pig pens are carried out, and efforts are also made to treat parasites in the pigs to speed up the fattening of the pigs.
    In order to ensure that a large number of fat pigs leave the pens quickly, Xianfeng Management Area has launched a campaign to increase the planting, intercropping, and relay intercropping of feed crops without competing with grain land, so as to ensure that there is no shortage of feed all year round.

    粗料细作  催育肥猪
    渭南县交斜管理区利用野草树叶等喂成肥猪
    郫县先锋管理区肥猪出槽比过去提早三个月
    本报西安3日电　陕西渭南县固市人民公社交斜管理区，大力革新养猪方法，以野草、树叶喂养肥猪，取得丰富经验。
    这个管理区今年1至10月共卖给国家三千零八十四头肥猪，这些肥猪主要是用野草、树叶、苜蓿以及各种农作物的梗叶喂肥的。
    交斜管理区对各种野菜、树叶和农作物的梗叶，都进行了化验，证明含有充足的营养。他们把采集的野草、树叶、各种农作物的梗叶，都经过了精细加工：青饲料铡碎；干叶干蔓用碾子碾碎、筛子筛过；给小猪吃的饲草饲料，都磨碎、用箩箩过，并做到分类加工，分类储存。喂时按各种饲草饲料的营养成分、味道，互相调配，并经常变样，使猪不吃重食。所有饲料都下锅煮熟，澄出苦水，在喂时掺温开水；对酸性的或有糖质的饲草饲料，还要进行发酵，以增加营养成分。
    在喂的方法上也多种多样。例如根据季节的不同和猪的大小不同，喂法也就不同。夏天喂稀些，冬天喂稠些；幼猪和肉猪喂稠些，架子猪喂稀些。还根据猪的各个生长时期（幼猪、架子猪和肉猪）所需要的营养，喂不同的饲草饲料。在催肥时期，才喂部分谷糠和麸皮。
    这个管理区已经发现猪能吃的野草、树叶、各种农作物的梗叶共有二百多种。全管理区在9、10月间的一次采集饲草饲料运动中，共采集了五百五十一万多斤干饲草饲料，全管理区目前圈存的八千五百九十二头猪，平均每头有六百四十一斤。
    最近，渭南县委总结了这个管理区采用野草、树叶和各种农作物枝叶等喂肥猪的经验，并专门组织了一个讲师团，带着大量的野生饲料标本到全省各地巡回讲解、展览，推广他们的先进经验。

    本报成都3日电　四川郫县先锋公社先锋管理区肥猪出槽多快好省。
    先锋管理区一年来，猪增长71.1％（现有圈存二千三百头），育肥速度加快，全区去年年底圈存的一千五百二十四头小猪，到11月份，93％已育成肥猪。这些出槽猪平均重量在一百五十斤左右，出槽时间比过去提早三个月，成本显著降低。
  先锋管理区的猪发展多、育肥快，关键在于充分发挥公社的优越性，认真贯彻“以集体饲养为主，公养私养并举”的方针。在具体作法上，全管理区建立了十四个饲养指挥场，每个场培育一些“卫星猪”，以便指导全面的育肥工作。围绕饲养指挥场，以食堂为单位，又建立了五十二个催肥猪圈，凡是小猪长成架子猪后，就送进催肥猪圈饲养。育肥的主要办法是：
    ①定时、定量喂食，喂食时要精心调配饲料，做到各种饲料搭配，粗料细喂，细料加香味，先粗后精，先稀后浓，切粗煮烂，温度适中，边吃边添，喂匀喂饱；
    ②使用药物催肥。一年来采用打牛奶针、割甲状腺等十一种催肥办法，其中最有效的是用自制的中药催肥素注射；注射这种催肥素比不注射的每天多长肉六两到半斤；
    ③加强防疫卫生工作。除打防疫针外，做到定期洗澡，猪圈消毒，还设法治疗猪体内的寄生虫，使生猪肥育加快。
    为了保证大量肥猪迅速出槽，先锋管理区在不与粮食争地的原则下，大搞增种、间种、套种饲料的运动，做到一年四季不缺饲料。（附图片）
