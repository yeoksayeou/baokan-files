    Socialist System and Bridge Technology
    Mao Yisheng, President of the Railway Science Research Institute

    During the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Pi, son of Cao Cao, led his troops on an eastern expedition against Sun Wu. Upon reaching the Yangtze River and seeing the turbulent waves, he dared not cross, lamenting, "This is truly Heaven's barrier separating North and South!" (from "Records of the Three Kingdoms"), and regretfully turned back. Later, during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, Kong Fan said, "The Yangtze River is a natural barrier, considered as such since ancient times" (from "Book of Chen"). The Yangtze thus "limited" the division of North and South China for thousands of years. But this was not limited by "Heaven," but by people. Indeed, once the great Mao Zedong era arrived, quickly "a bridge flies across, turning the natural chasm into a thoroughfare!" The completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge shattered the myth of the Yangtze River as an insurmountable barrier. Now, the second Yangtze River bridge, the Chongqing Bridge, has also been completed, and the third, the Nanjing Bridge, will soon begin construction. The Chinese people no longer have any large rivers or bridges that they cannot build with their own strength!

        The Excellent Tradition of Bridge Building in China

    Bridges are a characteristic of a nation's culture. As soon as humanity had transportation, it needed bridges. The more people lived near rivers, the more densely populated cities became, and the more bridges there were. Any country with early development would have many bridges. China has a long culture and many rivers, so of course, there are many bridges. Suzhou alone had 397 bridges in the early Qing Dynasty (from "Jiangnan Prefecture Records"). It is said that several million stone bridges have been built nationwide over the millennia. However, the characteristic of Chinese bridges lies not in quantity but in quality. First, it is reflected in the grandeur of scale. The "Zhongwei Bridge" in Xi'an, built during the Qin Dynasty, was already "six zhang wide, 280 bu long, divided into 68 spans" (from "Records of Guanzhong"). Later, the "Panguang Bridge" in Quanzhou, built around 1257 AD, "over 400 zhang long and 1 zhang 6 chi wide" (from "Quanzhou Prefecture Records"), was even more astonishing. Second, it is reflected in the variety of types. There were various types of bridges made of various materials. The above-mentioned Zhongwei Bridge and Panguang Bridge were both "beam bridges." There was a "pontoon bridge" on the Yellow River in Mengjin County around 270 AD. There was a stone "arch bridge" in Luoyang around 282 AD. There was a "cantilever bridge" in Daohe County, Gansu, around 410 AD. In addition, there were bamboo cable "suspension bridges" in Dujiangyan, Sichuan, iron cable suspension bridges in Panjiang, Guizhou, and a "movable bridge" that could open and close on the "Xiangzi Bridge" in Chaozhou, Guangdong. The main types of modern bridges are almost all included in ancient Chinese bridges. Third, it is reflected in the solid construction. Everywhere you can see stone bridges built hundreds of years ago, and even the "Luoyang Bridge" in Quanzhou, with nearly a thousand years of history, and the "Zhaozhou Bridge" in Hebei, with more than 1,300 years of history, are still in service today without interruption. Finally, and most importantly, it is reflected in the scientific structure of the bridges. The Zhaozhou Bridge is a 37-meter "span" stone arch bridge. In the bridge body above the large arch and below the road surface, four small arch holes were opened, which not only allowed water to pass but also reduced the weight of the bridge body. In modern bridges, this is called a "spandrel arch," which is the most economical, practical, and beautiful type, and is the most widely used, but the first time Europe built this type of arch bridge was more than 900 years later than China. The Luoyang Bridge, 3,600 chi long, used a kind of "li" to "glue" loose stones on the foundation to overcome the impact of waves when building the bridge piers, which was the earliest attempt at what is now called a "raft foundation." In addition, there are many similar creative structures. The most obvious proof is that modern heavy-duty vehicles drive on many ancient bridges. According to general design formulas, they cannot handle it, but they not only do not collapse, but are as solid as ever. It turns out that the structure fully utilizes the "passive pressure." This is still a new theory today, but it has long been widely used in Chinese stone bridges. Although the bridge-building masters of the past did not understand these scientific theories, they created various structural types by summarizing practical experience. Especially when repairing bridges, they understood the strengths and weaknesses of the structure from the damage, and thus sorted out a set of empirical rules to gradually improve the design. This is the excellent tradition of Chinese bridge-building technology and a valuable legacy passed down to future generations. From bridge construction, we also see the greatness of the Chinese working people.

    The Socialist System Guarantees the Rapid Development of Bridge Technology

    In the past hundred years, the excellent tradition of bridge-building technology in China has not been developed as it should have been due to the oppression of the feudal system and the aggression of imperialism. By the eve of liberation, China's bridge-building technology was already very backward in the world. Take the Qiantang River Bridge, designed by Chinese engineers themselves at that time, not only were the steel beams and machines foreign, but also the main bridge piers and bridge construction were contracted by foreigners. Although the problems of quicksand and deep foundations were solved technically, the methods used were also the old foreign ones, which were neither creative nor promoted. The situation of other old large bridges was similar, or even more backward. How can all these bridges be regarded as the technological heritage of old China?

    However, once liberated, China's bridge technology began to show a completely new look. After years of development, not only has the bridge-building team grown stronger and the material strength enriched on the basis of self-reliance, but also great achievements have been made in science and technology. The most obvious example is the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Its steel materials were produced in China, the steel beams were made in China, all projects were done by China itself, and there were many technical innovations that reached the world's advanced level, especially the pipe pile structure foundation completed with the help of Soviet experts, using vibration pile drivers to sink the pipe piles, which opened up a new era for underwater construction projects. I have given technical reports on this bridge in some capitalist countries, and their engineering circles were quite shocked and believed that China has made a major contribution to bridge technology.

    In the ten years since liberation, the number of railway, highway, and urban bridges built in China is considerable. The total length of railway bridges alone has reached 200,000 meters, not counting small and medium-sized bridges. Since the Great Leap Forward, the speed of bridge construction has been unprecedented. These bridges are distributed all over the country, the situation is complex, and the task is urgent, but they are all completed on schedule, and many are completed ahead of schedule. This is iron proof of the rapid development of bridge technology in China. This is because there is a correct direction, which is to solve the key problems in bridge technology in a faster, better, and more economical way. In other words, China's bridge technology is advancing along the glorious road of the general line for building socialism. This is all due to the leadership of the Party and the implementation of the mass line.

    Now, let me briefly introduce some of the key issues in bridge technology and see how these issues are resolved in China from the perspective of the requirements of the general line.

    How to Play a Role? The role of a bridge has become a common term, which shows that this role is valuable. There is an old saying, "Building bridges and repairing roads is doing good deeds," which can very well express this role—the meaning of leaving the difficulties to oneself and giving convenience to others. Building bridges on railways and highways must fully reflect this meaning. Just as roads serve vehicles and should be able to maximize the function of vehicles, bridges serving roads should also maximize the role of roads, otherwise, they will not become bridges but ferries. Speaking of ferries, people have always had a sense of vigilance, so the Yangtze River became a natural barrier. The Tang Dynasty poet Meng Haoran's poem "Looking at Jingkou": "The river wind and white waves rise, worrying the people at the ferry," is a portrayal of this mood. With a bridge to cross the river, the situation is very different. The first is safety, the second is that the speed of vehicles is not reduced, and the third is that vehicles do not stop when going up and down the bridge. Since the bridge is an elevated road and a part of the road, vehicles should travel on the bridge the same as on the road, and there should be no distinction between road and bridge. The width, slope, curvature, and "load" capacity of the bridge must have the same technical standards as the road it connects to, or even higher standards, because the development of transportation makes strengthening roads easier, while transforming bridges is more difficult.

    In addition to these positive roles of bridges, we must also consider its other aspect. For bridges over rivers, boats must travel on the river. Boats have a certain height, and the water level fluctuates. When the water rises, the boats rise, and the bridge must have a certain "clearance" height from the water surface to avoid hindering water traffic. For dry bridges across mountain valleys, they must connect to roads winding through the mountains, and these roads are often so high that it is difficult for the bridges to take root in the valleys. However, the bridge must not hinder the road. It can be seen that whether it is a bridge over a river or across a valley, there is a height problem. The problem of clearance above the water is even more difficult to solve because there is a contradiction between land and water transportation. The bridge on the water is connected to the road on land, requiring a "transition." This transition is a road built of earth for low bridges, while high bridges have to build bridges on both banks, called "approach bridges." If the boats on the water are high and the bridges are high, this approach bridge may be longer than the "main bridge" on the water, thus greatly increasing the cost of bridge construction. Some places, therefore, build tunnels to replace bridges. This clearance problem in capitalist countries is often unresolved due to disputes between vehicle and ship parties, resulting in indefinite bridge construction. However, in our country, thanks to the great cooperation of all parties concerned, it can be quickly and reasonably resolved.

    Take the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge as an example. We also did a design before liberation. At that time, the reactionary government's navy, under the pretext of national defense, insisted that the clearance above the water be at least 33 meters. Compared with the current bridge with 18 meters of clearance, not only would all the bridge piers have to be raised by 15 meters, but more importantly, the approach bridges on both banks would have to be greatly extended. How much waste would this create! Fortunately, that design was never realized! Now, the 18-meter clearance of the Wuhan Bridge has been proven by more than two years of facts that both water and land traffic are unobstructed, which shows the rationality of this number. Another example is the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, which is about to be built. The depth from the water surface to the bedrock at the bottom of the river far exceeds that of the Wuhan Bridge, and there are no mountains on either side of the river to use. Even with 18 meters of clearance, the height of the bridge piers and the length of the approach bridges are very alarming, so the project is very difficult. Moreover, the ships here must be higher than those in Wuhan, and 18 meters is not enough. It is rare in the world's bridges to have such a contradiction between vehicles and ships. However, in our country, due to the coordination of the whole country, the transportation and water transport departments try their best to reduce the height of the ships, the railway and land transport departments try their best to increase the clearance, and the local municipal departments try their best to cooperate with the bridge site. Everyone regards bridge construction as their own business and hopes to complete this largest bridge in the East as soon as possible. Any difficult problem can be solved reasonably, let alone this clearance problem. This is precisely the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system!

    How to Organize the Structure? A bridge is an elevated road, and its construction includes the road and the elevated parts. Since this road is facing the air below, with only support at both ends, it forms a kind of "superstructure" lying on top of the "substructure," creating a posture of being elevated. The various loads borne by the superstructure are transmitted to the foundation through the substructure. This upper and lower structure, in the water and in the air, forms a building that is long, high, flat, and hollow. Not only is it subjected to the power of vehicles above, the impact of water flow below, and the invasion of storms on both sides, but it is also affected by rain, snow, ice, and heat, and sometimes encounters earthquakes. Therefore, bridge construction bears a heavier and more complex burden than any other construction. This requires high-strength materials and the most reasonable structure to be formed from these materials. The so-called high-strength material is one that is light in weight, has great resistance, and has a long life. The so-called most reasonable structure is one that can maximize the strength of the material without exposing its weaknesses. Bridge design is a technology that enables this material to play its due role through this structure.

    When the bridge is playing its role, all kinds of loads on the bridge force the structure to change its shape, which is called "deformation," that is, forcing all the "components" that make up the structure to deform at the same time. The total deformation of the structure is the comprehensive result of the separate deformation of each component. The magnitude of the separate deformation of each component depends on the position of the component in the structure and the material from which the component is made. When the structural deformation stops, the bridge reaches a state of equilibrium under load. The smaller the deformation, the more stable the bridge, which is the goal of bridge design. Therefore, the materials that make up the structure must unify content and form, organically combine, and complement each other. The reason why there are many types of bridges is out of this requirement of mutual complementation. For example, in a "beam bridge" like a bench, the superstructure is a "beam," which shows a bending shape when deformed, so the material of the beam must be resistant to bending. The best material for this is steel, followed by reinforced concrete, and then wood. Another example is the upward-arching "arch bridge," the main structure of which is the crouching "arch." The deformation when bearing weight is compression, and the material of the arch must be resistant to compression without the need to resist tension, so stones or even bricks can be used. Another example is the suspension cable of a "suspension bridge," the deformation of which is all elongation. Its material must be resistant to tension without the need to resist compression, so steel wire rope is best, and even bamboo cables can do the job. It can be seen that the type of bridge should be determined by the materials that can be used, and then a structural form should be selected or created to fully exploit the maximum strength of this material.

    In capitalist countries, bridge construction often relies on raising funds through public debt, and in the future, "bridge tolls" are collected, treating bridges as commodities. The design and construction of bridges are based on the principle of earning maximum profit. The cheapest materials and the cheapest structures are adopted with money as the standard, regardless of whether they are scientifically reasonable, let alone matching the national economy, so there are often bizarre bridges. As for the exploitation of colonies, even if there are materials and labor locally, they are not used, and their own goods are forced to be sold, which is even more unnecessary to ask. Most of the railway bridges in China before liberation were built in this way. The bridges in China after liberation have fundamentally changed. The most significant thing is to use local materials. For example, in areas where stone is produced, stone is used as much as possible, and large-span stone arch bridges are built. For example, the Huanghugang stone arch bridge on the Hunan highway has a span of 60 meters. The second is to use all domestic materials and obey the unified distribution of the country. Whenever reinforced concrete can be used to build a bridge, steel is never used. For example, the reinforced concrete arch of the Danhe Bridge on the Zhanjiang-Dong Railway has a span of 88 meters. The third is to create a variety of structural types to fully utilize materials or improve the process. For example, the M-shaped steel truss of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the inclined cable-stayed bridge tower of the Jinsha River Highway Bridge, the 5.8-meter large pipe pile foundation of the Ganjiang Railway Bridge, and the steel and reinforced concrete combined beam near Xinyang on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, etc. It can be seen that how the structure of the bridge is organized is related to the social system of the country where it is located.

    How to Tap Potential? Any bridge material and the structure it forms have obvious advantages and disadvantages. The task of design is to promote the advantages and overcome the disadvantages, that is, to tap the potential of materials and structures, especially to strengthen the weak links. For example, concrete has a compressive strength that is far greater than its tensile strength. When used as the material of a beam, it has insufficient tensile strength and excessive compressive strength. However, if steel wires are placed in it and the steel wires are tensioned, so that the concrete is pre-compressed, and then it is partially tensioned, then this later elongation is only offsetting the pre-existing part of the compression. As a result, the concrete is still in a state of compression, but it has already played a role in resisting tension. This is "prestressed" concrete. Another example is that a hollow tube column is much stronger than a solid column with the same amount of material, and a raised tile can withstand more pressure than a flat tile. These are all examples of changing the shape to tap the potential of materials. Another example is that with the same material and the same quantity, in terms of the ability to withstand load or the size of the bridge hole, a solid slab beam is not as good as a hollow "truss," a straight slab beam is not as good as an arched slab beam, and whether it is a slab beam or a truss, a multi-span bridge that is not connected to each other is not as good as a multi-span connected "continuous bridge." If it is a truss, an arch, and a continuous bridge, it will be even more economical. These are all examples of leveraging the potential of the structure.

    In addition, the potential can also be tapped from the design theory with the same material and the same structural type. For example, "ultimate design" based on "plastic theory" is more economical than design based on "elastic theory." All these are methods of consciously tapping the potential. A bridge also has its more important potential, but it is automatically exerted by itself. The upper and lower structure of the bridge is a unified whole. When bearing the load, "one movement affects the whole body." It will automatically adjust according to the laws of nature to make the entire building reach a state of stable equilibrium. Through this automatic adjustment, the strong help the weak, and all the external forces that are not considered in the design, as well as the internal forces generated by the temporary deformation of the bridge, can be borne by the potential of the bridge. This strength reserve of the bridge is an important guarantee for it to safely complete its task. All the above examples of tapping potential can be seen everywhere in China's bridges, which is due to the full play of the enthusiasm of the masses, that is, the potential of people. Among them, the more prominent ones are the continuous steel truss with pipe piles as the foundation of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the 42-meter span prefabricated prestressed reinforced concrete rigid beam and flexible arch used in the Bawanghe Bridge on the Jier Railway, and the use of reinforced concrete pipes to build a 35-meter high bridge tower to replace the bridge piers in the Huangtugou Bridge near Gancaodian on the Baolan Railway, and so on. In terms of theory, some reinforced concrete beam bridges have adopted advanced ultimate design.

    How to Unify Contradictions? Building a bridge faces many factors in nature, some of which can be used, and some of which are contradictory. Some of these factors are relatively fixed, such as topography and geology, and some are constantly changing, such as water flow and wind and rain. When selecting the bridge site, the first thing to do is to make full use of the terrain. For example, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is built between Snake Mountain in Wuchang and Tortoise Mountain in Hanyang due to its large clearance, in order to reduce the length of the approach bridge and overcome the contradiction between vehicles and ships crossing the bridge. The second is to consider hydrology and geology. In a river, where the river surface is wide, the water is shallow and the flow is slow, and where the river surface is narrow, the water is deep and the flow is rapid, is it better to build a long bridge with short piers, or a short bridge with high piers? If the geology at the bottom of the river is good where the river surface is wide, and the geology at the bottom of the river is complex where the river surface is narrow, is it a long bridge with an easy foundation, or a short bridge with a difficult foundation? These contradictions have emerged new solutions under the premise of great cooperation among all parties in China. For example, regarding the width of the river, the water conservancy department can build "diversion dikes" to regulate the water flow and compress the bridge length; regarding the foundation depth, the geological department can vigorously assist in exploration and fully collect information to jointly determine the correct bridge alignment. Once the bridge site is selected and the total length of the bridge is known, how many bridge spans should it be divided into? The longer the span of the bridge span, the fewer the bridge piers, but the superstructure will cost more. The shorter the span, the more the superstructure will save, but the more bridge piers there will be. The main contradiction here is the span of one hole of the bridge and the depth of the foundation of the bridge pier, because the more bridge spans or the more bridge piers are only a matter of the quantity of the project, but if the span of the bridge span is large, or the foundation of the bridge pier is deep, it is a matter of the technical level of the project. For more important bridges in China, the design and construction departments invite relevant scientific research institutions and universities to hold meetings, which are resolved after full research, so they are always the most appropriate.

    When building bridge piers, the first thing to do is to overcome the various contradictions in the foundation project, such as hydraulic impact, sediment obstruction, deep-water pressure, etc. After the bridge piers are built, setting up the superstructure of the bridge body in the water and in the air is also full of difficulties and contradictions everywhere. All these problems must be solved rationally by comprehensively considering the various natural factors of the bridge site and combining the characteristics of the bridge. During construction, we should also make full use of the power of nature, such as the ebb and flow of tides, gravity balance, etc., to help overcome the contradictions of nature. It can be seen that the bridge is a product of the victory over nature through fierce struggle under the conditions of combining theory with practice. In the solution of all the above contradictions, the bridge-building responsible units in China are not fighting alone, but have always received the support and assistance of all relevant parties. Often, for a bridge, various relevant positive factors across the country are mobilized. For example, the materials and equipment required for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge are all given priority ordering in dozens of factories across the country, and the Wuhan municipal government gave great support in the fight against floods. Such a collective force to overcome difficulties and unify contradictions can only be fully mobilized in a socialist country!

    How to Improve Speed? High quality not only comes from large quantities but is also inseparable from high speed. Bridges are often surrounded by enemies and attacked from all sides during the construction process. Even when manufacturing materials and components, it is necessary to strike while the iron is hot, otherwise, things will change. Therefore, striving for high speed has become an important means to ensure quality. At the same time, high speed also promotes the continuous development of new materials, new structures, new theories, new styles, new designs, and new construction in bridge technology. For example, regarding new materials, we use quick-setting high-strength concrete to reduce the setting time of concrete and made ceramsite concrete to reduce its weight; regarding new structures, in addition to the components made of the above-mentioned prestressed concrete, now prefabricated concrete structures are being promoted, and all concrete components are manufactured in factories and then transported to the site for assembly instead of being poured on the spot, which can not only rush the construction period but also guarantee quality. Regarding new theories, this is developing with the development of new materials and new structures, such as prestressed concrete and pipe pile foundations. At the same time, rapid design and construction also raise new questions for theory. Regarding new styles, since bridges, like buildings, must also be beautiful, but materials or man-hours cannot be wasted because of this, we require the structure itself, in addition to being able to withstand the load, be economical and durable, and also be able to reflect the artistic style of modeling. Regarding new designs, it is mainly reflected in standardization. We have pre-made "standard designs" of various materials and various types of bridge structures according to the requirements of different loads, so that they can be applied to bridges with the same situation and can be supplied whenever needed, to overcome the contradiction that the design cannot keep up with the construction. This is a major condition for promoting prefabricated structures. Regarding new construction, it is mainly reflected in mechanization. Bridge construction has many strict requirements that must be met, such as lifting extremely heavy components in the air, completing very complicated work underwater, and operating very accurate measurements in wind and waves, all of which require the help of machinery, some with strong capabilities and some with high precision. When building bridges, we generally set up factories to manufacture mechanical tools, not only to build large ones, such as the 400-ton vibration pile driver manufactured by the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge factory, but also to produce various simple "local" machines, such as lifting derricks, cable cranes, etc., to reduce labor intensity. Through the above new measures to improve speed, we can adapt to local conditions, break with conventions, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and continuously innovate in bridge technology. Internally, there is parallel operation, and externally, there is comprehensive collaboration, so we have achieved many great victories. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, inspired by the general line, the masses have been full of enthusiasm and have exerted unparalleled initiative and creativity, and have frequently set off a climax of learning from advanced and catching up with advanced, thus the design and construction speed has continued to appear unprecedented records, providing better favorable conditions for the future greater bridge tasks of "bridge-building industrialization."

    From what has been said above, it can be seen that any key issues in bridge technology can be reasonably resolved in socialist China, so bridge construction can develop rapidly. Bridge construction is only a very small department in socialist construction, but like other departments, it proves from its own practice the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The extremely broad development space it creates for science and technology once again proves the infinite vitality of the Party's general line and the great historical significance of the Great Leap Forward!

    社会主义制度和桥梁技术
    铁道科学研究院院长　茅以升
    三国时，曹操的儿子曹丕，带领人马，东征孙吴，到了长江，见波涛汹涌，不敢渡，叹口气说：“固天所以限南北也”（见“三国志”），没奈何废然而返。后来南北朝时，有个孔范就说：“长江天堑，古以为限”（见“陈书”）。长江就这样把我国南北“限”了几千年。但这并不是“天”限，而是人限的。果然，一到伟大的毛泽东时代，很快就“一桥飞架，南北天堑变通途！”武汉长江大桥的建成，打破了长江天堑的迷信；现在长江上第二座的重庆大桥，又已建成，第三座的南京大桥，接着又要开工。中国人民再没有什么大江大河上的桥梁，不能用自己的力量来造成的了！
        我国桥梁建筑的优良传统
    桥梁是一国文化的一个特征。人类一有交通，即需要桥梁，越是靠河的地方，人口越集中，发展成为城市，桥梁就越多。任何开发较早的国家，桥梁都不会少，我国文化悠久，而且河流众多，当然桥梁也就特别多。苏州一个县，在清代初年，就有三百九十七座桥梁（见“江南府县志”）。据说仅石桥一项，几千年来，全国造了三百多万座。然而，我国桥梁的特点，不在数量而在质量。首先表现在规模的宏伟。秦始皇时所造的西安“中渭桥”，就已经是“宽六丈，长二百八十步，分六十八孔”（见“关中记”）。其后公元1257年左右修建的泉州“盘光桥”，“长四百余丈，宽一丈六尺”（见“泉州府志”），更是惊人。其次表现在种类繁多，有各种材料造成的各式各样的桥。上述的中渭桥和盘光桥都是“梁式桥”；约公元270年时在孟津县黄河上即有“浮桥”；约公元282年时在洛阳就有石砌“拱桥”；约公元410年时在甘肃导河县就有“伸臂桥”；此外，在四川都江堰有竹索“悬桥”，贵州盘江有铁索悬桥，广东潮州“湘子桥”有开合“活动桥”。近代桥梁的主要型式，在我国古桥中，几乎包括无遗了。再其次表现在建造的坚固，到处可看到几百年前造的石桥，甚至有将近千年历史的泉州“洛阳桥”和一千三百多年历史的河北“赵州桥”，直到今天还在继续服务，未曾中断。最后，也是最重要的，表现在桥梁结构的科学化。赵州桥是个三十七米“跨度”的石拱桥，在大拱之上路面之下的桥身里，开了四个洞的小拱，不但可以过水，而且减轻了桥身重量。这在近代桥梁上，名为“敞肩拱”，是个最经济、适用而又美观的型式，用途最广，但在欧洲初次建造这种拱桥时，却比我国晚了九百多年。洛阳桥，长三千六百尺，修桥墩时，为了克服波涛冲击，在桥基上利用一种“砺”来把松的石块“胶固”，就是近代所谓“筏型基础”的最早尝试。此外，类似的创造性的结构，还有很多。最明显的证明就是在许多古桥上行驶近代载重汽车，按一般设计公式核算，并不能胜任，但它们不但不倒，而且坚固如初，原来是在结构上，充分利用了“被动压力”的缘故；这在今天还是个新理论，而在我国石桥上，老早就被普遍应用了。以前的桥工巨匠虽然不了解这些科学理论，但是他们都从总结实践经验的过程中创造出各种结构型式。特别是在修理桥梁时，他们从损坏的状况，理会出结构中的强点和弱点所在，因而整理出一套经验法则，来逐步改进设计。这是我国造桥技术的优良传统，成为传留后世的宝贵遗产。从桥梁建筑中，也看到我国劳动人民的伟大。
    社会主义制度保证了桥梁技术的飞跃发展
    近百年来，我国造桥技术的优良传统，由于封建制度的压迫和帝国主义的侵略，未得到应有的发展；到了解放前夕，我国造桥技术，在世界上已经显得非常落后了。就拿那时由我国工程师自己设计的钱塘江大桥来说，不但钢梁和机器是外国来的，而且主要的桥墩和架桥工程都是由外国人包工的；技术上虽然解决了流沙和深基础等问题，但所用方法也是外国的老一套，既非创造，亦未得到推广。其他几座旧的大桥，情况类似，甚或更为落后。所有这些桥梁，那能算是旧中国的技术遗产呢？
    但是，一到解放，我国桥梁技术就开始出现完全崭新的面貌。经过逐年发展，不但在自力更生的基础上，壮大了桥梁队伍，充实了物质力量，而且在科学技术上，取得了巨大成就。最明显的例证就是武汉长江大桥。它的钢料是我国生产的，钢梁是我国制造的，一切工程是我国自办的，而且技术上有许多创造，达到世界先进水平，特别是在苏联专家帮助下完成的管柱结构基础，利用震动打桩机，下沉管柱，更为深水下的建筑工程开辟了一个新纪元。我曾在一些资本主义国家的首都，作过关于这座桥的技术报告，他们工程界颇为震动，都认为我国对桥梁技术作出了重大贡献。
    解放后十年来，我国所造铁路、公路和城市桥梁的数量，是很可观的，仅铁路大桥一项，总延长即达二十万米，中小桥不算。大跃进以来，桥梁的建设速度，更是空前。这些桥梁分布在全国各地，情况复杂，任务紧迫，但都是如期完成，而且很多是提前完成的。这就是我国桥梁技术飞跃发展的铁证。这是由于有了正确方向，这个方向就是要多快好省地解决桥梁技术中的关键问题。也就是说，我国桥梁技术是遵循着建设社会主义总路线的光辉道路前进的。这都是由于有了党的领导和贯彻了群众路线的必然结果。
    现在简单介绍一下桥梁技术中的一些关键问题，并从总路线的要求，来看这些问题在我国是如何解决的。
    如何发挥作用　桥梁作用已经成为通用名词，可见这种作用是难能可贵的。以前有句俗话“修桥补路做功德”，很能表达这种作用——把困难留给自己，方便让与别人的意义。在铁道公路上修桥，就要充分体现出这种意义。就像道路为车辆服务，要能发挥车辆的最大功能一样，桥梁为道路服务也要发挥道路的最大作用，否则就不成为桥梁而是渡船了。提到渡船，历来人们都不免要怀有戒心，因此长江才成为天堑。唐代诗人孟浩然“望京口”诗：“江风白浪起，愁杀渡头人”正是这种心情的写照。有了桥梁过江，情景就大不相同了。第一是安全，第二是车辆速度不降低，第三是上下桥时车不停留。由于桥梁是架空的道路，是道路的一部分，车在桥上走就要和在路上一样，不应有路归路、桥归桥的区别。桥梁的宽度、坡度、弯度和“荷载”能力等等都要和它连接的道路有同一技术标准，甚至要有更高的标准，因为运输发展，加强道路比较容易而改造桥梁是更为困难的。
    除了桥梁的这些积极作用而外，还要考虑它的另一方面。对过河的桥梁来说，河上要走船，船有一定高度而水面有涨落，水涨船高，桥梁离水面就要有一定“净空”高度，才不致阻碍水上交通。对跨越山谷的旱桥来说，它必须连接山中盘旋的道路，而这种道路往往高到使桥梁在山谷里难以生根，然而桥总不能因此而妨碍路。可见不论是过河或越谷的桥，都有个高度问题；而桥下水上的净空问题更难解决，因为在这里陆运和航运是有矛盾的。水上的桥和陆上的路相连接，需要一个“过渡”，这个过渡，在低桥是土方筑成的路，而在高桥就不得不在两岸上修桥，名为“引桥”。如果水上的船高桥高，这个引桥就可能比水上的“正桥”还长，因而大大增加了建桥费。有的地方就因此而建筑隧道来代替桥梁。这个净空问题在资本主义国家，往往因车船两方的争执，悬而不决，以致造桥无期，但在我国，由于有关各方的大协作，就能迅速合理地解决。
    再以武汉长江大桥来说，解放前我们也作过设计，那时反动政府海军方面，竟借口国防，坚持要求水上净空至少三十三米，比起现在建成的桥的十八米净空来，不但要把所有的桥墩都提高十五米，而且更重要的，要把两岸引桥都大大延长，这该形成多大浪费！幸而那个设计，未曾实现！现在武汉大桥的十八米净空，经过两年多的事实证明，水陆两方，畅通无阻，可见这个数字的合理。又如即将兴建的南京长江大桥，水面至江底岩层深度大大超过武汉大桥，江的两岸又无山头可利用，纵然用十八米净空，桥墩高度和引桥长度，都十分惊人，因而工程非常艰巨，何况这里的船，当然要比武汉的高，十八米还不够用，世界大桥中，像这样车船间的矛盾，恐怕是很少见的了。但在我们国家，由于全国一盘棋，交通水运部门尽量从降低船身高度设法，铁路陆运部门尽量从提高净空设法，地方市政部门尽量从配合桥址设法，大家都把修桥当作自己的事，都渴望早日建成这一世界东方最大的桥，任何困难问题都能合理解决，何况这一净空问题。这正是我们社会主义制度的无比优越性！
    如何组织构成　桥梁既是架空的道路，它的建筑就包括道路与架空的两个部分。由于这个道路是下面临空的，只有两头有支持，因而形成一种“上部结构”，横卧在“下部结构”之上，造成架空之势。上部结构所承受的各种荷载，通过下部结构，都要传达到地基。这上下部结构，在水中、空中，组成一座又长又高又扁而又空心的建筑，不但上面受着车辆的动力，下面受着水流的冲击，两旁受着风暴的侵袭，而且还要受雨雪、冰冻、酷热的影响，有时还会遇到地震。因此，桥梁建筑的担负比任何其他建筑都要格外沉重、格外复杂。这就需要用高强度的材料，并且把这材料组成最合理的结构。所谓高强度的材料就是要本身重量轻而抵抗力大并且寿命长。所谓最合理的结构就是要能发挥材料的最大强度而不暴露其弱点。桥梁设计就是使这种材料，通过这种结构，来起应有的桥梁作用的一种技术。
    桥梁在起作用时，所有桥上的各种荷载即迫使结构变更形状，谓之“变形”，也就是迫使组成结构的各单元“构件”，都同时变形。结构的总变形即是各构件单独变形的综合结果。各构件单独变形的大小，决定于构件在结构中的位置和制成构件的材料。结构变形终止时，桥梁即到达在荷载下的平衡状态。变形愈小，桥梁愈稳定，这是桥梁设计的争取目标。因此，材料组成结构，要能统一内容与形式，有机结合，相辅相成。桥梁之所以有多种型式，就是出于这种相辅相成的要求。比如，像一条板凳的“梁式桥”，上部结构是座“梁”，变形时显出弯曲形状，因而梁的材料就要能抗弯。这种材料最好是钢，其次是钢筋混凝土，再其次是木材。又如向上隆起的“拱桥”，主要结构是蜷伏的“拱”，承重时的变形是压缩，拱的材料就要能抗压而不必抗拉，因而就可用石块，甚至砖块。又如“悬桥”的吊索，变形全是拉长，其材料就要能抗拉而不需抗压，因而钢丝绳最好，甚至竹缆也可胜任了。可见桥梁的型式应当决定于可能采用的材料，然后选择或创造一种结构形式，来充分发挥这种材料的最大强度。
    在资本主义国家，修桥常靠公债筹款，将来收“过桥费”，把桥梁当作商品，对于桥梁的设计和施工，都以能博取最大利润为原则；以金钱为标准，来采用最便宜的材料，最便宜的结构，而不问其科学上是否合理，更谈不到配合全国经济，因而常有离奇的桥梁出现；至于对殖民地的剥削，当地有料有工而不用，强迫推销自己的货色，那就更不必问了。我国解放前的铁路桥梁，大半就是这样造成的。解放后的我国桥梁就根本改观了，最显著的是就地取材，如在产石地区，就尽量采用石料而且修建大跨度的石拱桥，像湖南公路黄虎港石拱桥，跨度达六十米；其次是全用本国材料并且服从全国统一分配，凡能用钢筋混凝土修桥时，决不用钢，如詹东铁路丹河桥钢筋混凝土大拱，跨度已达八十八米。再其次是创造多种结构型式，来充分利用材料或改进工艺过程，如武汉长江大桥的米字形钢桁架，金沙江公路桥的斜缆索桥塔，赣江铁路桥的五点八米的大型管柱基础，京广铁路信阳附近的钢和钢筋混凝土结合梁，等等。可见桥梁的如何组织构成是和它所在国家的社会制度有关的。
    如何挖掘潜力　任何桥梁材料和它组成的结构，都有显而易见的优点和缺点。设计的任务就要发扬优点，克服缺点，也就是要挖掘材料和结构的潜力，特别要加强薄弱环节。比如混凝土，抗压强度大大超过抗拉强度，用作梁的材料，则抗拉不足而抗压有余。但如放进钢丝，用张拉钢丝法，使混凝土预先全部受压，然后再使它局部受拉，那么，这后来的拉长不过是抵消了预有的部分压缩，其结果这混凝土仍然是在受压状态，但它却已经起了抗拉作用。这就是“预应力”混凝土。又如，空心管子的柱子，比同一数量材料的实心柱子，要强得多，一块隆起的瓦，比平面的瓦要能多受压，都是从变更形状来挖材料潜力的例子。又如，同一材料，同一数量，拿胜任荷载的能力或桥孔大小来说，实心板梁不如透空“桁架”，平直板梁不如拱形板梁，而不论板梁或桁架，互不连接的多孔桥就不如多孔连接的“连续桥”。如果又是桁架，又是拱形，又是连续，那就更经济了。这都是发挥结构潜力的例子。
    此外，同一材料，同一结构型式，还可从设计理论上来挖潜力，比如根据“塑性理论”来做“极限设计”，就比根据“弹性理论”来做设计更为经济。所有这些都是有意识地发挥潜力的方法。一座桥梁还有它更重要的潜力，却是靠它自己自动发挥出来的。桥梁的上下部结构是一个统一体，在承受荷载时，“牵一发动全身”，是会根据自然法则，自动调节，使整个建筑达到稳定平衡状态的。通过这样自动调节，以强济弱，所有设计时考虑不到的外力，以及桥梁临时变形所产生的内力，就都可由桥梁的潜力来担负了。桥梁的这种强度储备，是它能够安全完成任务的重要保证。所有以上的这些挖掘潜力的例子，在我国桥梁中，随处可见，这都是由于充分发挥了群众积极性，也就是人的潜力的结果。其中较突出的如武汉长江大桥以管柱为基础的连续钢桁架，集二铁路坝王河桥采用的四十二米跨度装配式预应力钢筋混凝土刚性梁柔性拱，宝兰铁路甘草店附近黄土沟桥用了钢筋混凝土的管子建成三十五米高的桥塔，来代替桥墩，等等。在理论方面，有的钢筋混凝土的梁式桥已采用了先进的极限设计。
    如何统一矛盾　建筑一座桥梁，面临着自然界的许多因素，有的是可以利用的，有的是有矛盾的。这些因素，有的比较固定，如地形、地质，有的经常变化，如水流、风雨。在选择桥梁地址时，首先要充分利用地形，如武汉长江大桥，由于净空大，就建筑在武昌蛇山和汉阳龟山之间，来减少引桥长度，克服车船过桥的矛盾。其次要考虑水文和地质。一条河在河面宽的地方，水浅流缓，河面狭的地方，水深流急，是造长桥矮墩好呢，还是短桥高墩好呢？假如河面宽的地方，河底地质好，河面狭的地方，河底地质复杂，是要基础好做的长桥呢，还是基础难做的短桥呢？这些矛盾，在我国各方大协作的前提下，出现了新的解决途径，比如关于河流宽度，水利部门可建筑“导流堤”来调节水流，压缩桥长；关于基础深度，地质部门可大力协助勘探，充分搜集资料，来协同定出正确的桥位线。桥位选定了，知道桥的总长，但该分几个桥孔呢？桥孔跨度长了，桥墩当然减少，但上部结构就费了，跨度短了，上部结构省，但桥墩又多了。这里的主要矛盾是桥梁一孔的跨度和桥墩基础的深度，因为桥孔多或桥墩多，还只是工程数量问题，但如桥孔的跨度大，或桥墩的基础深，则是工程的技术水平问题了。这在我国比较重要的桥梁，都是由设计施工部门约同有关的科学研究机构和高等学校举行会议，经过充分研究而解决的，因而总是最适当的。
    在建筑桥墩时，首先要克服基础工程中的种种矛盾，如水力冲击，泥沙阻碍，深水压力，等等，桥墩筑就，在水上空中，架设桥身的上部结构，其中也是困难重重，处处矛盾。所有这些问题必须善于综合考虑桥址的各种自然因素，结合桥梁的特点合理解决，而在施工时，更应充分利用自然界的力量，如潮水涨落，重力平衡等等，来帮助克服自然界的矛盾。可见桥梁是在理论结合实际的条件下，通过激烈斗争，战胜自然的产物。在所有以上矛盾的解决中，我国的造桥负责单位都不是孤军作战，而是始终都得到有关各方的支持协助的，时常为了一座桥而调动了全国有关的各种积极因素。比如武汉长江大桥所需材料机具，在全国几十个工厂都属于优先订货，在与洪水作战时，武汉市地方更给了极大支援。像这样克服困难，统一矛盾的集体力量，只有在社会主义国家才能充分调动起来！
    如何提高速度　高质量不但出于大的数量，而且和高的速度也是分不开的。桥梁在修建过程中，时常四面楚歌，处处受敌，就是在制造材料构件时，也是要趁热打铁，迟则生变，因而争取高速度成为保证质量的重要手段。同时，高速度也促进了新材料、新结构、新理论、新风格、新设计、新施工等在桥梁技术中的不断发展。举例来说：关于新材料，我们用快硬高强混凝土来减少混凝土的凝结时间，制成了陶粒混凝土来减轻自重；关于新结构，除了上述预应力混凝土做成的构件外，现在推广装配式混凝土结构，将所有混凝土构件都在工厂中制造，然后运往现场装配，来代替就地浇筑，既可赶工，更能保证质量。关于新理论，这是随着新材料、新结构的发展而发展的，如预应力混凝土和管柱基础就是这样。同时，快速设计和施工也为理论提出新问题。关于新风格，由于桥梁和建筑一样，也要美观，但不能因此而浪费材料或工时，我们就要求结构本身，除了胜任荷载，经济耐久而外，还要能体现出艺术上的造型风格。关于新设计，主要表现在标准化，我们把各种材料，各种型式的桥梁结构，都按照不同荷载的要求，预先制成“定型设计”，以便适用于情况相同的桥梁，随时需要，随时供给，来克服设计赶不上施工的矛盾。这是推广装配式结构的一个主要条件。关于新施工，主要表现在机械化。桥梁建筑有很多严格要求必须满足，如极沉重的构件要在空中起吊，很复杂的工作要在水下完成，很准确的测量要在风浪中操作，等等，都需要机械的助力，有的要能力强，有的要精度高。我们在修桥时，一般都附设工厂，制造机械工具，不但能造大型的，如武汉长江大桥工厂制造出四百吨震动打桩机，而且生产各种简易“土”机械，如起吊扒杆，缆索起重机等，来减轻劳动强度。经过以上各种提高速度的新措施，我们在桥梁技术上就能因地制宜，打破陈规，土洋并举，不断革新，内则平行作业，外则全面协作，因而取得了不少巨大胜利。特别是大跃进以来，受了总路线的鼓舞，群众干劲十足，发挥了无比的积极性和创造性，经常掀起学先进赶先进的高潮，因而设计和施工速度，不断出现空前纪录，为今后更大的桥梁任务，提供了更好的“造桥工业化”的有利条件。
    从上所说，可见任何桥梁技术中的关键问题，在社会主义的我国总能合理解决，因而桥梁建设得以迅速发展。桥梁建设只是社会主义建设中的一个极小部门，然而它和其他部门一样，从本身实践中，证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性，它给科学技术事业所创造的极其广阔的发展天地，再一次证明了党的总路线的无限生命力和大跃进的伟大历史意义！
