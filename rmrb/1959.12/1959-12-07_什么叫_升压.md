What is "Voltage Boosting"?

	"Voltage Boosting" means increasing the supply voltage under the condition of fully utilizing the original equipment and basically not adding new equipment. For example, increasing the lighting supply from 110 volts to 220 volts; increasing the power supply from 220 volts to 380 volts; increasing the 3,300-volt power supply to 6,300 volts; increasing the 6,300-volt power supply to 10,000 volts, etc. In this way, the power supply capacity can be greatly improved and the power loss on the wires can be reduced. For example, if the power supply is increased from 3,300 volts to 6,300 volts, the power supply capacity can be increased by more than one time without increasing or replacing large wires, and the power loss can be reduced by three-quarters.

    什么叫“升压”
    “升压”就是在充分利用原有设备基本上不增加新设备的条件下提高电压供电，如将照明由一百一十伏电压供电升高到二百二十伏供电；动力由二百二十伏电压供电升高到三百八十伏供电；三千三百伏电压供电升高到六千三百伏供电；六千三百伏供电升高到一万伏供电等等，这样就可以大大提高供电能力，减少电线上的电力损耗。如由三千三百伏电压升高到六千三百伏供电，在不增加和不更换大电线的情况下，可以提高供电能力一倍以上，而电力损耗则可减少四分之三。
