Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 12th: The Harbin Power Machinery Manufacturing Plant, by December 10th, had exceeded its annual plan for total output value by 15%, total output by 5.1%, labor productivity by 17%, and reduced costs by 13% compared to the plan. The variety of products and the product qualification rate both achieved 100% of the state plan.

In implementing this year's state plan, the Harbin Power Machinery Manufacturing Plant has consistently adhered to putting politics in command and fully utilized people's subjective initiative, thereby overcoming numerous difficulties. This year, the plant manufactured diesel engines and coal hopper elevators for the first time, and the factory's equipment was outdated with many new workers. Therefore, at the beginning of the year, it encountered many problems. Based on this situation, the factory Party committee promptly convened a cadre meeting to launch a "speaking out, airing views, and debating" campaign, criticizing the emotions of fearing difficulty and relaxing efforts, and summarizing past experiences in using local iron and local coal to cast general parts. Subsequently, a mass movement of everyone contributing ideas was launched throughout the plant, finally overcoming all difficulties and ensuring the early and comprehensive completion of the state plan.

In the process of completing the plan, the plant also adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, using old parts and leftover materials to self-make thirty-two sets of special equipment, such as automatic threading machines, steel grinding machines, and cam shaft grinders, overcoming the difficulties of outdated equipment and insufficient large equipment, and improving the factory's level of mechanization. Changchun Transformer Factory

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: By December 3rd, the Changchun Transformer Factory had already completed the various indicators of its annual plan ahead of schedule and exceeded them. The total output value exceeded by 46.2%, product output exceeded by more than double, labor productivity exceeded the plan by 41.19%, the total product cost was reduced by 4.84% compared to the plan, and the product variety plan was also exceeded, with product quality meeting national standards.

When arranging the production plan, the factory launched a mass movement, conveying the bottom line layer by layer from top to bottom, and mobilizing the masses from bottom to top to discuss and implement it. The production plan for the next month was drafted by the 10th of each month and sent to departments and workshops for comments. A production meeting was held on the 15th of each month to implement the plan, which was then passed down to the workshops. From the 22nd to the 25th, it was handed over to the workshop employees for extensive discussion to implement the plan down to the production teams.

The technological innovation campaign launched by all the factory employees is another important reason for the early completion of the annual plan. This year, the factory originally planned to increase one hundred and seventy workers. However, as a result of the workers carrying out a technological innovation movement, the plan to increase workers was completely cut. Shijiazhuang Vehicle Factory

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: The Shijiazhuang Vehicle Factory, which only started manufacturing freight cars in batches this year, has fully completed this year's production plan. As of December 6th, the factory's total output value completed 111.27% of the state plan. The output of freight cars, coal loaders, and steel respectively completed 102%, 101%, and 105% of the state plan. Comparable product costs were reduced by 10.24% compared to the state plan. Profits exceeded the plan by 55.56%. Labor productivity completed 110.14% of the plan. Product quality was qualified. Work-related injuries were greatly reduced.

The factory's ability to achieve an overall leap forward is mainly because the factory Party committee adhered to putting politics in command, led the workers to continuously struggle against the right-leaning conservative thinking of a few cadres, and carried out technological innovation and technological revolution movements, improving production capacity. At the same time, they educated the workers to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials by producing themselves, tapping potential, using substitutes, finding new raw materials, and saving materials. Tianjin Agricultural Machinery Factory

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: The Tianjin Agricultural Machinery Factory completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way. As of the end of November, the annual total output value plan was exceeded by 3.6%, the output plan was exceeded by 12.33%, product quality was improved by 1.33%, the labor productivity plan was exceeded by 17.7%, the product variety plan was fully completed, costs were reduced by 17%, and profits exceeded by 39.3%, achieving safe production.

Since August and September, the enthusiasm of the factory's employees has been high. They have revised the production plan several times, expanding production targets. The factory Party branch guided the situation, guiding the employees to work hard and skillfully, combining work and rest, and launching a wave of technological innovation. From August to November, the workers put forward more than 15,000 innovation suggestions, of which more than 13,000 were adopted. The level of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire factory's equipment has therefore increased from 48% at the beginning of the year to 78%. The workload completed in one day in November was equivalent to the workload of nine days in July. The workers reduced their labor intensity, went to work on time, rested on time, and completed their production tasks very well. Benxi Alloy Factory

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: The Benxi Municipal State-owned Alloy Factory comprehensively and over-fulfilled its annual production tasks by the 7th of this month. The total output value exceeded by 1.9%, total output exceeded by 2.6%, product qualification rate exceeded by 1%, labor productivity exceeded by 2.7%, costs decreased by 1.2%, and profits turned over to the state exceeded by 41.7%.

The red flag competition and technical performance competition organized by the factory played an important role in improving technical operation level and ensuring the completion of the plan. After the alloy class learned Wang Jingxiu's "three diligences" firing operation experience in the technical performance competition, the output of aluminum alloy increased by 120%. After the smelting workshop promoted the Wu Jiapeng team's "one stability, two flatness, three accuracy, four quickness" furnace tapping operation experience, the quality qualification rate of refined copper increased from 92% in the past to 98%. The Guo Changxu team in the smelting workshop improved the furnace cleaning operation, increasing efficiency by thirty-two times. Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th: After completing this year's output value and development excavation plan thirty-three days and twenty-eight days ahead of schedule, the Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine of the Kailuan Mining Bureau completed the state plan for the whole year of producing 3.35 million tons of coal ahead of schedule on December 7th. The efficiency of all employees increased by 4.72% compared to the plan, the cost of raw coal decreased by 5% compared to the plan, and the quality of raw coal also met the prescribed indicators.

Since the beginning of this year, the mine Party committee has organized workers to carry out fifteen large-scale "speaking out, airing views, and debating" campaigns in response to the right-leaning conservative thinking of some cadres and the key issues in production. Through these speaking out and debating campaigns, not only did the entire mine's employees maintain full labor enthusiasm at all times, but it also broke the "five loosenings and five tightnesses" – loosening at the beginning of the year and tightening at the end of the year, loosening at the beginning of the season and tightening at the end of the season, loosening at the beginning of the month and tightening at the end of the month, loosening in the first shift and tightening in the last shift, loosening at the beginning of the shift and tightening at the end of the shift. After these "conventional rules" were broken, the overall production level of the entire mine rose evenly, thereby ensuring the early and over-fulfillment of the annual plan. Nanchang General Machinery Factory

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 11th: The Nanchang General Machinery Factory in Jiangxi Province completed the state plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way. As of December 10th, the total output value exceeded by 5.49%, the output of fourteen products was completed according to the plan, the output of water pumps was twenty units more than the plan, the product qualification rate exceeded by 1%, labor productivity exceeded by 6.71%, costs were reduced by 8.2%, and profits turned over to the state exceeded by 25.71%.

    抓紧岁末每一天  全面告捷迎新年
    一批厂矿提前全面完成年计划哈尔滨动力机制造厂
    据新华社哈尔滨12日电　哈尔滨动力机制造厂到12月10日为止，总产值超过全年计划15％，总产量超过5.1％，劳动生产率超过17％，成本比计划降低13％，产品品种和产品合格率都百分之百地完成了国家计划。
    哈尔滨动力机制造厂在执行今年的国家计划中，一直坚持政治挂帅，充分发挥人的主观能动性，从而克服了重重困难。这个厂今年还是第一次制造柴油机、煤斗提升机，而且工厂设备陈旧、新工人多，因此在年初遇到了许多难题。根据这种情况，工厂党委及时召开干部会议展开鸣放辩论，批判了畏难松劲情绪，并且总结了过去用土铁土炭铸造一般部件的经验。随后，在全厂掀起了一个人人献计的群众运动，终于克服了一切困难，保证了国家计划的提前全面完成。
    这个厂在完成计划过程中，还采用土洋结合的办法，利用旧部件和余材废料，自制了自动套丝机、磨钢机、秃轮轴磨床等三十二项专用设备，克服了设备陈旧、大设备不足的困难，提高了工厂的机械化程度。长春变压器厂
    据新华社长春讯　长春变压器厂到12月3日止，已经提前超额完成了年度计划的各项指标，总产值超额46.2％，产品产量超额一倍以上，劳动生产率超过计划41.19％，产品总成本比计划降低4.84％；产品品种计划也超额完成了，产品质量合乎国家标准。
    这个厂在安排生产计划的时候，大搞群众运动自上而下地层层交底，自下而上地发动群众讨论落实。每月10日就把下月的生产计划订出来，送到科室和车间征求意见；每月15日召开生产会议落实计划，然后下达到车间；22日到25日交给车间职工展开广泛讨论，把计划落实到生产小组。
    全厂职工大闹技术革新，是这个厂提前完成全年计划的另一重要原因。今年这个厂原计划增加一百七十名工人。但是，由于工人们开展了技术革新运动，结果，把增加工人的计划全部削减了。石家庄车辆厂
    据新华社天津讯　今年才开始成批制造货车的石家庄车辆厂，已经全面完成了今年的生产计划。到12月6日，这个厂的总产值完成国家计划111.27％；货车、加煤机、钢三种产品的产量分别完成国家计划的102％、101％、105％；可比产品成本比国家计划降低10.24％；利润超过计划55.56％；劳动生产率完成计划110.14％；产品质量合格；工伤事故大大减少。
    这个厂能够取得全面跃进，主要是工厂党委坚持了政治挂帅，领导职工不断地向少数干部的右倾保守思想作斗争，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，提高了生产能力。同时教育职工用自己生产、挖掘潜力、利用代用品、找寻新原料、节省用料等办法，解决了原材料不足的困难。天津农业机械厂
    据新华社天津讯　天津农业机械厂提前全面完成了今年的国家计划。截至11月底，全年总产值计划超额3.6％，产量计划超额12.33％，产品质量提高1.33％，劳动生产率计划超额17.7％，品润计划超种计划全面完成，成本降低17％，利额39.3％，做到了安全生产。
    从8、9月份以来，这个厂的职工热情高涨，几次修改生产计划，扩大生产指标，工厂党支部因势利导，引导职工苦干加巧干，劳逸结合，掀起了技术革新的热潮。从8月到11月，工人们共提出革新建议一万五千多件，被采纳了一万三千多件。全厂设备的机械化和半机械化程度因此由年初的48％上升到78％。11月份一天完成的工作量，相当于7月份九天的工作量。工人们减轻了劳动强度，按时上班，按时休息，生产任务完成得很好。本溪合金厂
    据新华社沈阳讯　本溪市地方国营合金厂到本月7日止全面超额完成了年度生产任务。总产值超过1.9％，总产量超过2.6％，产品合格率超过1％，劳动生产率超过2.7％，成本下降1.2％，上缴利润超过41.7％。
    这个厂所组织的红旗竞赛和技术表演赛，对提高技术操作水平，保证完成计划起了重要的作用。合金班在技术表演赛中学习了王景秀的“三勤”烧火操作经验之后，使铝合金产量提高了120％。冶炼车间推广了吴家朋小组“一稳、两平、三准、四快”出炉操作经验以后，精铜的质量合格率由过去92％提高到98％。冶炼车间郭长绪小组改进清炉操作，提高效率三十二倍。唐家庄煤矿
    据新华社天津12日电　开滦矿务局唐家庄煤矿继提前三十三天和二十八天完成了今年产值和开拓掘进计划以后，在12月7日又提前完成了全年产煤三百三十五万吨的国家计划。全员效率比计划提高4.72％，原煤成本比计划降低5％，原煤质量也都合乎规定指标。
    今年以来，这个矿党委针对某些干部存在的右倾保守思想，以及生产当中的关键问题，先后组织职工开展了十五次大鸣大放大辩论。过通这些鸣放辩论，不仅使全矿职工始终保持了饱满的劳动热情，而且打破了“五松五紧”——年初松年末紧，季初松季末紧，月初松月末紧，第一班松末班紧，班初松班末紧的“老常规”。这些“常规”被打破之后，全矿的生产水平均衡上升，从而保证了全年计划的提前超额完成。南昌通用机械厂
    据新华社南昌11日电　江西南昌通用机械厂提前全面超额完成了国家计划。到12月10日止，总产值超过5.49％，十四种产品的产量都按计划完成，水泵比计划多产了二十台，产品合格率超过1％，劳动生产率超过6.71％，成本降低8.2％，上缴利润超过25.71％。
