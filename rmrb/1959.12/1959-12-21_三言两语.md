　　A Few Words

　　Small things appear larger the closer they are to the eye;
　　Large things appear smaller the further they are from the eye.
　　However, insignificance does not become great just by being placed on the tip of one's nose; greatness does not become small just because it is temporarily out of sight.
　　Marx said: "Sand appears very high under a microscope, while a pagoda seems lower than a mountain."

　　Time and money are both easily "lost" and are often felt to be insufficient.
　　Squandering money corrupts things; wasting time corrupts people.
　　However, in terms of time, racing against the clock is progressive; in terms of money, being penny-pinching is degenerate.　　(Tang Fengyi)

　　Don't think of yourself as a piece of pure steel, letting it rust and decay; think of yourself as a piece of pig iron! Throw it into the revolutionary furnace and forge it into a true piece of pure steel.
　　Overcoming your own shortcomings, even by a tiny bit, will increase your confidence and courage a hundredfold; tolerating minor mistakes is the root cause of bigger errors.
                      (Zhang Xinzheng)

　　三言两语
    小的，离眼越近越大；
    大的，离眼越远越小。
    不过，渺小并不因放在鼻子尖上就变大；伟大也不因暂时看不清它就会小。
    马克思说：“沙子在显微镜下看起来似乎很高的，宝塔比起山岳来就低了。”
    时间与金钱，同是容易“流失”，而又常被人患不足的。
    挥霍金钱是败坏物；虚度年华是败坏人。
    然而，在时间上，争分夺秒是上进；在金钱上，斤斤计较却是堕落。　　（唐丰义）
    别以为自己就是一块纯钢，任它生锈腐烂；当它是一块生铁吧！投进革命的熔炉里，把它锻炼成为一块真正的纯钢。
    战胜自己的缺点，哪怕是一星半点，也会百倍增强你的信心和勇气；容忍微小的过错，却是造成更大错误的根源。
                      （张心正）
