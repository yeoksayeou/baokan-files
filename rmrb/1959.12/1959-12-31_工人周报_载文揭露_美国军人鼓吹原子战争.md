　　“Worker’s Weekly” Publishes Article Exposing
    American Military Personnel Advocating Atomic Warfare
    Xinhua News Agency, December 29th dispatch from New York: The New York "Worker's Weekly" published a report on December 27th by Mike Newberry from Washington, entitled "Army Officers Disclose Atomic 'Hot War' Plans."
    Newberry wrote: U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Military Operations, General George Decker, revealed to the Army Association's Fifth Annual Meeting that "like most military personnel, I have given considerable thought to the problem of future warfare." Decker said that the "future war" occupying his mind would most likely be an atomic war.
    This figure, second in command in U.S. Army policy decision-making, boasted that since "once atomic weapons are used on the battlefield, the destruction of exposed targets seems quite certain," he advocated for a comprehensive atomic war plan.
    The first point of Decker's war plan demanded that the U.S. Army "quickly identify and destroy the enemy's targets with conventional forces or atomic forces as deemed appropriate."
    The final point demanded that the U.S. Army "be able to enter the enemy's territory, restore order, and control the civilians."
    Newberry said that Decker's "hot war" plan was official in nature, not only due to the Deputy Chief of Staff's own high position, but also because Army Secretary Brucker and U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Lemnitzer were on the rostrum at the meeting at the time.
    Chief of Staff Lemnitzer, emphasizing his deputy's combat plan, said that America's strategic corps "is ready at any time, and can be dispatched to any place in the world where it may be needed shortly after receiving orders." Lemnitzer said that the Army "must be able to deal with threats in areas outside of those where Army troops are already deployed."
    The author said that these words almost undisguisedly refer to countries the State Department considers "threatened," even though these countries do not consider themselves "threatened."
    Last month, Lemnitzer said that 40% of the entire U.S. Army was stationed on overseas bases scattered throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. Referring to General Lemnitzer's words last month, his emphasis on sending the U.S. Army to "areas outside of those where Army troops are already deployed" is noteworthy.
    Speaking of the Army's reserve forces, Lemnitzer said, "The reserve forces are already at the highest state of readiness in our country's peacetime history."
    He said that such a reserve force is extremely important for the concept of modern warfare.
    Army Secretary Brucker said that the "reservists are ready to be called into service at any time" for these thirty-seven reserve divisions.
    Lieutenant General Trudeau, Director of Missile Research, gave a speech on hydrogen bombs, missiles, and poison gas.
    General Trudeau spoke highly of electronic weapons, hoping that this weapon would end the "Communists' blackmail with ballistic missiles."

### “工人周报”载文揭露  美国军人鼓吹原子战争

　　“工人周报”载文揭露
    美国军人鼓吹原子战争
    据新华社29日讯　纽约消息：纽约“工人周报”27日刊载了迈克·纽伯里自华盛顿发出的一篇报道，题目是“陆军军官们吐露了原子‘热战’计划”。
    纽伯里写道：美国陆军高级司令部副参谋长乔治·贝克尔将军向陆军协会第五届年会吐露说，“同大多数军人一样，我对未来战争问题进行了相当多的考虑。”贝克尔说，盘据在他脑子里的“未来战争”将很可能是一个原子战争。
    这位在美国陆军政策的决策方面居于第二位的人物吹嘘说，由于“原子武器一旦在战场上使用，暴露的目标就将被毁灭这件事看来相当肯定，”他主张进行全面的原子战争计划。
    贝克尔的战争计划的第一点要求美国陆军“用认为适当的常规力量或是原子力量迅速找出敌人的目标并且加以摧毁”。
    最后一点要求美国陆军“能够进入敌人的国土，恢复秩序和控制平民”。
    纽伯里说，贝克尔的“热战”计划是具有官方性质的，这不但是由于这位副参谋长自己地位高，而且是由于陆军部长布鲁克和美国陆军参谋长兰尼兹尔将军当时都在会议讲坛上。
    参谋长兰尼兹尔在强调他们副手的作战计划时说，美国的战略兵团“随时准备着，在接到命令后一会儿就可以开往可能需要它的世界上任何地方”。兰尼兹尔说，陆军“一定要能够在陆军部队已经部署好的地区以外的地区对付威胁。”
    作者说，这些话几乎是毫不隐讳地指国务院认为“受到威胁”的国家。虽然这些国家并不认为自己“受到威胁”。
    兰尼兹尔上月说，美国全部陆军中已经有40％的部队驻在遍布亚洲、非洲、欧洲和拉丁美洲各国的海外基地上。参照兰尼兹尔将军上月所说的话，他强调派美国陆军到“陆军部队已经部署好的地区以外的地区”去就值得注意了。
    兰尼兹尔在谈到陆军后备力量时说，“后备部队已经处于我国和平时期历史上最高度的准备状态”。
    他说，这样的后备力量对现代化战争概念来说是极为重要的。
    陆军部长布鲁克说，这三十七个后备师的“后备人员随时准备着应召入伍”。
    导弹研究主任特鲁多中将发表了一篇关于氢弹、导弹和毒气的演说。
    特鲁多将军对电子武器评价很高，他希望这种武器会结束“共产党人靠弹道导弹进行的讹诈”。
