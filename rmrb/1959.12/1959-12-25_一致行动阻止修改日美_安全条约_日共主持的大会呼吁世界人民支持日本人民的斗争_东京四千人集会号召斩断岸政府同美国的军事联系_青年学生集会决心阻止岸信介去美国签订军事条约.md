Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: At the大会 against revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" sponsored by the Japanese Communist Party on the 22nd, a "Call to the People of the World and Asian Countries" was adopted, calling on the people of all countries to support the just and patriotic struggle of the Japanese people.

The call pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government, disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people, is colluding with U.S. imperialism to forcibly revise the "Security Treaty" and conspiring to establish an aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance. This plot will enable U.S. imperialism to further strengthen its rule and oppression over the Japanese people, revive Japanese militarism, and seriously threaten world peace, especially Asian peace.

The call emphasized that the Japanese people are eager to establish an independent, peaceful, democratic, and neutral country, resolutely oppose Japan becoming a base for U.S. imperialism to wage the "Cold War," oppose the revival of Japanese militarism that is hostile to the people of Asia and the world, and oppose Japan's re-emergence as an enemy of socialist countries and the people of Asian countries. To this end, the Japanese people are making every effort to struggle.

The call hoped that the people of Asia and the world would work together to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance and to safeguard world and Asian peace.

The大会 also adopted a "Call to the Japanese People." This call pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government is preparing to forcibly sign a new "Security Treaty" in January next year in order to openly carry out Japan's nuclear armament, conclude a Japan-U.S. military alliance hostile to China and the Soviet Union, and embark on the road of reviving militarism and war.

The call pointed out that the road Japan should take is to strive for the establishment of a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan.

The call said that Japan is currently facing a crucial juncture, and the Japanese people must strengthen their unity and fully launch a struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The call called on the Japanese people to organize joint struggle organizations in every corner of the country and launch various forms of struggle to smash the conspiracies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

The call called on all democratic forces, including the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party, to further strengthen their unity, establish a united front, and fight to prevent Nobusuke Kishi from going to the United States to sign a new "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: Four thousand people from all walks of life in Japan held a大会 in Tokyo today to oppose the Nobusuke Kishi government's revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the enactment of reactionary laws prohibiting demonstrations and marches around the Diet, and attempts to "punish" four Socialist Party members. This大会 was the central gathering in the tenth national unified action of the Japanese people to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Nobusuke Kishi government called the petition to the Diet by the Japanese people on November 27th to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" a "riot," and used this as an excuse to enact laws prohibiting demonstrations and marches around the Diet, while also wanting to "punish" Inejiro Asanuma and other four Socialist Party members, conspiring to suppress the Japanese people's movement.

The大会 today adopted resolutions and statements. The resolution expressed anger at the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to suppress the mass movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty." The resolution demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party cease all repressive measures against the people's movement against the "Security Treaty" and immediately revoke the decision to "punish" Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma and others.

The大会 issued a statement saying that the arrogant actions taken by the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party in order to sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in January next year show that they are facing the increasingly high tide of the Japanese people's movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and the strong condemnation of international public opinion, and feel anxious and uneasy. The statement said that the Japanese people will persist in the struggle to prevent the signing of the new "Security Treaty."

The four Socialist Party members who the Nobusuke Kishi government wanted to "punish" spoke at the大会.

Inejiro Asanuma expressed at the大会 his determination to fight against the Nobusuke Kishi government's "punishment" of them. He emphasized that this is a struggle for truth and justice, because petitioning the Diet is an inalienable right of the people. He said that the Socialist Party will demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government announce the full text of the revised "Security Treaty" at the regular Diet session to be held on December 29th, forcing Nobusuke Kishi not to go to the United States to sign this treaty. Asanuma finally called on the masses attending the大会 to fight for severing the Nobusuke Kishi government's military ties with the United States and for striving for Japan's peace and independence.

Japanese Communist Party member Yoshio Shiga emphasized in his speech that the reason why the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party wanted to "punish" Inejiro Asanuma was because Asanuma publicly stated during his visit to China that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people.

The大会 elected representatives to visit the speakers of both houses of the Diet, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and delivered the大会's protest letter to them. The participants in the大会 held a demonstration after the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: Representatives of Japanese youth and students held a meeting in Tokyo today and decided to call on national youth organizations to concentrate their efforts on launching a movement to prevent Nobusuke Kishi from going to the United States to sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Nobusuke Kishi is scheduled to go to the United States on January 16th next year to sign the new treaty.

This meeting was initiated by the Joint Struggle Conference of Japanese Youth and Students to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and was attended by representatives of youth joint struggle committees from various regions.

The meeting adopted a call to Japanese youth and students. The call emphasized that every possible means should be used to prevent Nobusuke Kishi from going to the United States to sign the new "Security Treaty."

The meeting also adopted a call to the youth of the world. It said that Japanese youth and students will continue to struggle until the attempt to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is crushed and the "Security Treaty" is abolished. Japanese youth and students believe that their struggle is part of the global movement for peaceful coexistence and complete disarmament.

The meeting also decided that youth and student organizations should support the struggle of coal miners against so-called "enterprise rationalization" and carry out a spring struggle together with the workers. The meeting suggested that youth organizations further develop joint actions between working youth and students.

The meeting received news that joint struggle committees of youth to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" have been established in twenty-five prefectures, including Hokkaido, Akita, and Hiroshima.

Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese writer Yoko Matsuoka said on the 22nd that the Japanese people should fight with greater strength next year to smash the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and strive to achieve Japan's peace, independence, and neutrality.

Yoko Matsuoka said this when reviewing the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" this year at a lecture held by the "Sunday Club."

When talking about the role played by Japanese women in this movement, Matsuoka said that this year Japanese women first participated in the movement against newspaper price increases, and then participated in the Fifth World大会 against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and convened the Japan Mothers大会. During the preparations for these two大会s, they repelled all the attacks of the reactionaries. She finally said that the task of activists in the Japanese mass movement next year will be to not only expose that the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan violates the Japanese Constitution, but also to expose that strengthening the "Self-Defense Forces" and producing Lockheed fighter jets also violate the Constitution, thereby accumulating the people's fighting force to strive for peace, independence, and neutrality.

    新华社24日讯　东京消息：在22日由日本共产党主持的反对修改日美“安全条约”大会上，通过了“给世界和亚洲各国人民的呼吁书”，呼吁各国人民支持日本人民的正义和爱国的斗争。
    呼吁书指出，岸信介政府不顾日本人民的反对，勾结美帝国主义强行修改“安全条约”、阴谋建立侵略性的日美军事同盟。这个阴谋将使美帝国主义进一步加强对日本人民的统治和压迫，复活日本军国主义，并且将严重威胁世界和平尤其是亚洲和平。
    呼吁书强调指出，日本人民渴望建立一个独立、和平、民主和中立的国家，坚决反对日本变成美帝国主义进行“冷战”的基地，反对以亚洲和世界人民为敌的复活日本军国主义，并且反对日本重新成为社会主义国家和亚洲各国人民的敌人。为此，日本人民正在全力进行斗争。
    呼吁书希望亚洲和全世界人民为反对美日军事同盟和为维护世界和亚洲和平而共同奋斗。
    这次大会还通过了“给日本人民的呼吁书”。这份呼吁书指出，岸信介政府准备在明年1月强行签署新的“安全条约”，以便公开进行日本的核武装，缔结与中苏两国为敌的日美军事同盟，走向复活军国主义和战争的道路。
    呼吁书指出日本应走的道路是争取建立和平、独立、民主、中立的日本。
    呼吁书说，日本目前正面临着重要关头，日本人民必须加强团结，全力展开阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争。
    呼吁书号召日本人民在全国每一个角落组织共同斗争组织，展开各种各样的斗争，来粉碎日美反动派的阴谋。
    呼吁书号召包括日本共产党和社会党在内的全体民主力量进一步加强团结，建立统一战线，为阻止岸信介去美国签署新的“安全条约”而斗争。
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本各界人士四千人今天在东京举行大会，反对岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”、制订禁止在国会周围示威游行的反动法律和企图“惩罚”四名社会党议员。这次大会是日本人民阻止修改日美“安全条约”第十次全国统一行动中的中央集会。
    岸信介政府把日本人民在11月27日为了反对修改日美“安全条约”向国会进行请愿称为“暴乱”，并且以此为借口制订了禁止在国会周围示威游行的法律，同时要“惩罚”浅沼稻次郎等四名社会党议员，阴谋镇压日本的人民运动。
    今天的大会通过了决议和声明。决议对于岸信介政府阴谋镇压反对修改“安全条约”的群众运动表示愤怒。决议要求岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党停止对人民反对“安全条约”的运动采取的一切镇压措施，立即撤销要“惩罚”社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎等人的决定。
    大会发表声明说，岸信介政府和自由民主党为了在明年1月签署新的日美“安全条约”而采取的蛮横做法，说明它们面对着日本人民日益高涨的反对修改“安全条约”的运动和国际舆论的强烈谴责，感到焦急不安。声明说，日本人民将坚持阻止签署新的“安全条约的”斗争。
    岸信介政府要“惩罚”的四名社会党议员在会上讲了话。
    浅沼稻次郎在会上表示决心要为反对岸信介政府对他们的“惩戒”而斗争。他强调说，这是为真理和正义而斗争，因为向国会请愿是人民的不可剥夺的权利。他说，社会党将在12月29日召开的国会平时会议上要求岸信介政府公布修改后的“安全条约”的全文，迫使岸信介不到美国去签署这项条约。浅沼最后号召参加大会的群众为斩断岸信介政府和美国的军事联系、为争取日本的和平和独立而斗争。
    日本共产党议员志贺义雄在讲话中强调说，岸信介政府和自由民主党所以要“处罚”浅沼稻次郎，是因为浅沼在访问中国的时候公开说，美帝国主义是日本人民和中国人民的共同敌人。
    大会选出代表访问了参众两院议长、岸信介首相和东京都警察厅，把大会的抗议书送交他们。参加大会的人在会后举行了示威游行。
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本青年和学生的代表今天在东京举行会议，决定号召全国青年组织集中力量展开阻止岸信介去美国签署新的日美“安全条约”的运动。岸信介预定在明年1月16日前往美国签署新条约。
    这次会议是由日本青年和学生阻止修改日美“安全条约”共同斗争会议发起的，参加会议的有各地青年共同斗争委员会的代表。
    会议通过了给日本青年和学生的呼吁书。呼吁书强调应当千方百计地来阻止岸信介去美国签订新的“安全条约”。
    会上还通过了给世界青年的呼吁书。它说，日本青年和学生将继续斗争，直到粉碎修改日美“安全条约”的企图和废除“安全条约”为止。日本的青年和学生认为，他们的斗争是全世界人民要求和平共处和全面裁军的运动的组成部分。
    会议还决定青年和学生组织要支持煤矿工人反对所谓“企业合理化”的斗争，并且同工人一起进行春季斗争。会议建议，青年组织进一步发展劳动青年和学生之间的共同行动。
    会议收到的消息说，包括北海道、秋田、广岛在内的二十五个县里都已成立了青年阻止修改“安全条约”共同斗争委员会。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本著名作家松冈洋子22日说，明年日本人民应当以更大的力量来进行斗争，以粉碎岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋，争取实现日本的和平、独立和中立。
    松冈洋子是在“星期日俱乐部”举办的讲座上回顾今年反对修改“安全条约”的斗争时这样说的。
    松冈在谈到日本妇女在这一运动中所起的作用时说，今年日本妇女首先参加了反对报纸涨价的运动，接着参加了第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会和召开了日本母亲大会。在筹备这两个大会期间，她们击退了反动派的一切进攻。她最后说，日本群众运动积极分子明年的任务将是不仅揭露美军驻扎在日本违反日本宪法，还要揭露加强“自卫队”力量和生产洛克希德式战斗机也是违反宪法的，从而积蓄人民争取实现和平、独立和中立的战斗力量。
