Xinhua News Agency, 6th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session adopted a resolution on the 5th, based on the report of the Trusteeship Council, to determine the dates of independence for two trust territories: Togo, under French trusteeship, will become independent on April 27, 1960; Somaliland, under Italian trusteeship, will become independent on July 1, 1960. The trusteeship of France and Italy in these two places will end on the date of independence, and the newly established countries will be admitted to the United Nations as equal member states.

Another resolution adopted by the General Assembly recommended that Western Samoa, under New Zealand trusteeship, be granted independence in 1961.

Togo

The struggle of the Togolese people for independence has led the General Assembly to adopt a resolution, based on the report of the Trusteeship Council, that Togo will become independent on April 27 next year.

In November 1957, the United Nations Trusteeship Council passed a resolution that Togo would hold elections for a legislative assembly in April 1958, and that the legislative assembly would decide on the issue of ending the trusteeship and independence. As a result of the election, the nationalist party advocating Togo's independence—the Togolese Unity Committee—won. The new legislative assembly passed a resolution in October 1958, demanding independence and the end of the trusteeship in 1960.

Togo is located in West Africa, with a land area of 55,000 square kilometers and a population of over one million. The Togolese people have suffered from long-term colonial plunder and rule. It became a German colony in 1884. During World War I, Britain and France divided Togo. After World War II, in December 1946, the United Nations decided that Togo would continue to be under the trusteeship of Britain and France separately. After Ghana's independence in March 1957, British-administered Western Togo was incorporated into Ghana by a United Nations decision. France had declared its trusteeship of Togo as an "autonomous republic" within the French Community in August 1956, but the Togolese people resolutely opposed it and continued their struggle for independence.

Somaliland

Somaliland was originally an ancient country in the "Horn of Africa," but in the 19th century it was divided by Italian, British, and French colonialists into three colonies. After World War II, in November 1949, the General Assembly decided to entrust the former Italian Somaliland to Italian trusteeship for a period of ten years, until independence in 1960. The people of Somaliland have always opposed the trusteeship and demanded independence. Last year, Italy tried its best to obstruct Somaliland's independence and held deceptive elections, but was opposed by the people of Somaliland. Now, Italian-administered Somaliland will become independent on July 1, 1960.

Italian-administered Somaliland has an area of more than 510,000 square kilometers and a population of 1.31 million, mainly engaged in nomadic life. Industry and agriculture are backward, and the people's lives are miserable. The people of Somaliland have been fighting against colonial division and striving for the unified independence of the entire Somaliland. At the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in December 1957, the delegation of the people of Somaliland expressed its determination to strive for Somaliland to become a unified and independent country. Therefore, the independence of Italian-administered Somaliland will surely inspire the people of Somaliland, still under British and French colonial rule, to strive for unification and independence.

    联大决定结束法国和意大利的托管
    多哥和索马里兰明年独立
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议5日根据托管委员会的报告通过了一项决议，确定两个托管地的独立日期：由法国托管的多哥在1960年4月27日独立；意大利托管的索马里兰在1960年7月1日独立。法国和意大利在这两个地方的托管将从独立日起结束，新建立的国家将作为平等的成员国吸收到联合国里来。
    大会通过的另一个决议建议，由新西兰托管的西萨摩亚群岛在1961年给予独立。
    多哥
    多哥人民争取独立的斗争，已使联大根据托管委员会的报告通过了多哥明年4月27日独立的决议。
    1957年11月，联合国托管委员会曾通过决议，多哥在1958年4月举行立法议会选举，由该立法议会决定关于结束托管和独立的问题。选举结果，主张多哥独立的民族主义政党——多哥统一委员会获得胜利。新立法议会在1958年10月通过决议，要求在1960年获得独立并结束托管。
    多哥位于非洲西部，土地面积五万五千平方公里，人口一百多万。多哥人民遭受了长期的殖民主义掠夺和统治。1884年即沦为德国的殖民地。第一次世界大战期间，英法分割了多哥。第二次世界大战后，1946年12月联合国决定多哥仍由英、法继续分别托管。1957年3月加纳独立后，英国托管的西部多哥经联合国决定并入加纳。法国曾在1956年8月宣布它托管的多哥为法兰西联邦的“自治共和国”，但多哥人民坚决反对，继续展开争取独立的斗争。　（明）
    索马里兰
    索马里兰原是在“非洲之角”的古国，但十九世纪就被意大利、英国和法国殖民主义者所瓜分，成了三个殖民地。第二次世界大战后，1949年11月联大决定仍将原意属索马里兰交由意大利托管，托管期为十年，至1960年独立。索马里兰人民一直反对托管，要求独立。去年意大利曾竭力阻挠索马里兰独立，举行欺骗性选举，但遭到索马里兰人民的反对。现在意大利托管的索马里兰将在1960年7月1日独立。
    意大利托管的索马里兰，面积五十一万多平方公里，人口一百三十一万，主要以游牧为生，工农业落后，人民生活痛苦。索马里兰人民一直为反对殖民主义的分割，争取整个索马里兰的统一独立而进行斗争。在1957年12月举行的亚非人民团结大会上，索马里兰人民的代表团就表示决心要争取索马里兰成为一个统一和独立的国家。因此，意大利托管的索马里兰的独立，必将鼓舞仍在英国和法国殖民统治下的索马里兰人民争取统一和独立的斗志。　（立）（附图片）
