    Combining Overhaul and Equipment Innovation
    Shanghai Cold-Rolled Strip Steel Plant Continuously Improves Production Capacity

    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, 18th Dispatch) The workers of Shanghai Cold-Rolled Strip Steel Plant, while overhauling machinery, equipment, and factory buildings, simultaneously implemented technological innovation measures, carrying out minor overhauls with minor innovations and major overhauls with major innovations, continuously improving the production capacity of the equipment, and increasing strip steel production quarter by quarter. The entire plant has already completed its annual plans for output value, production, and profit delivery forty-one days ahead of schedule. Currently, the workers are using the overhaul opportunity to further implement technological innovation measures to ensure that production continues to rise in the first quarter of next year.

    The Shanghai Cold-Rolled Strip Steel Plant was established last year after the merger and reorganization of fifteen small lane factories. The plant's twenty-eight cold-rolled strip steel mills are all old machines that have been in use for more than ten years. Rolling steel is both difficult and unsafe. The plant's workers are determined to rely on their own efforts and engage in large-scale technological innovation to change this situation. They seize the time for equipment maintenance and overhaul, implementing various technological innovation measures one by one. Minor overhauls lead to minor innovations, and major overhauls lead to major innovations. For example, the old-fashioned rolling mills' pull-up discs could not stop automatically, and the iron plugs and guide plates had to be moved manually. Changing the rolls was time-consuming, the rolling mill's operating rate was low, and production was affected. The workers in the rolling workshop successfully tested flexible iron plugs, flexible guide plates, roll changing frames, and semi-automatic pull-up disc stopping devices, etc., and during minor overhauls, installed them on the rolling mills in batches. Currently, each of the twenty-eight rolling mills has adopted two to seven technological innovation measures. After the implementation of these innovation projects, the old machines that used to produce three and a half to four tons of strip steel per day can now produce seven tons of strip steel per day. In the past, the operating rate of rolling mills in the entire workshop was less than 90%, but now it has increased to 95%. The plant's cold-rolled strip steel production has increased from an average monthly output of 2,500 tons in the first half of the year to an average monthly output of 4,500 tons in the third quarter, and to 5,807 tons and 6,496 tons in October and November.

    The important equipment in the return train workshop—the five-ton traveling crane—used to have one or two accidents per month, such as burning switches and hitting ground shafts, affecting the continuous leap forward in production. The workers used the opportunity of the major overhaul in November to relocate the crane's contact switch to a safer position and install a safety switch between the lifting hook and the crane's ground shaft, avoiding the accidents of the ground shaft often being damaged by the hook. After this technological innovation, this crane has not had any accidents such as damaging the ground shaft since November 15th.

    结合检修　革新设备
    上海冷轧带钢厂生产能力不断提高
    本报上海18日电　上海冷轧带钢厂职工在检修机器设备和厂房中，同时实现技术革新措施，实行小检修小革新、大检修大革新，不断提高设备的生产能力，使带钢产量一个季度比一个季度增长。全厂已经提前四十一天完成了产值、产量和上缴利润的年度计划。目前，职工正利用检修机会，进一步实现技术革新措施，保证明年第一季度生产继续上升。
    上海冷轧带钢厂是由十五家里弄小厂在去年合并改组以后建立的。厂里的二十八台冷轧带钢机都是使用了十年以上的老机器，轧起钢来既吃力又不安全。这个厂的职工决心自力更生，大搞技术革新，来改变这种状况。他们抓紧设备维护检修时间，一件一件地实现各项技术革新措施。小检修小革新，大检修大革新。如老式轧钢机上拉盘不能自动停车、塞铁和导板要用手工移动，掉换轧辊费时较多，轧钢机作业率低，影响轧钢的产量。压延车间的职工就试验成功活络塞铁、活络导板、换轧辊架子和拉盘半自动停车装置等，并在小检修中，把它们分批地安装到轧钢机上去。目前，二十八台轧钢机每台都采用了二件到七件技术革新措施。这些革新项目实现后，过去日产三吨半到四吨带钢的老机器，现在可以日产七吨带钢。过去全车间轧钢机作业率不到90％，现在提高到95％。全厂冷轧带钢的产量从上半年平均月产二千五百吨，上升到三季度平均月产四千五百吨，10、11两月上升到五千八百零七吨和六千四百九十六吨。
    回火车间的重要设备——五吨行车，过去一个月中总要发生一两次烧开关、碰地轴等事故，影响生产继续跃进。职工就利用11月份大检修的机会，把行车接触开关改装在另一个比较安全的位置上，在起重钩和行车地轴之间加装一只保险开关，避免了地轴常常被钩子碰坏的事故。经过这次技术革新，这台行车从上月15日到现在未曾发生过碰坏地轴等事故。
