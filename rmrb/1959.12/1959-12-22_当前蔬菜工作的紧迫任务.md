　　We achieved a great victory in vegetable production in 1959. This year, the suburbs of most cities established strong vegetable production bases, overcame serious natural disasters, and achieved bumper vegetable harvests. Cities have basically achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables; vegetable production in the vast rural areas has also greatly increased, especially the collective production of vegetables has seen prominent development. On the basis of the bumper vegetable harvest, a large-scale mass movement for processing and storing vegetables was launched throughout urban and rural areas. Many cities mobilized a large amount of labor and transportation from the urban areas to assist in the rush harvesting, transportation, and storage of autumn vegetables; some cities put forward slogans such as "urban-rural cooperation, public-private partnership, every household stores, everyone participates" and "one cellar of vegetables per courtyard, one jar of vegetables per family, not a leaf is discarded, not a vegetable rots," mobilizing the vast masses in urban and suburban areas to process and store large quantities of vegetables. According to statistics from sixty-three cities in the north, a total of 8.2 billion catties of vegetables were stored for consumption this winter and next spring, an increase of about three times compared to last year. The current supply situation is generally abundant. At present, people in major and medium-sized cities can generally eat one to one and a half catties of vegetables per day. Rural public canteens generally eat more vegetables than cities, and many water conservancy construction sites can also be fully supplied, which plays an important role in regulating meals and improving nutrition. All of this fully demonstrates that, thanks to the attention and concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and thanks to the strengthening of leadership by party committees at all levels and the launch of a large-scale mass movement, we won a great victory on the vegetable front in 1959.

　　However, can we think that the vegetable work has "passed the test" and we can rest easy from now on? No, we cannot think that way. Not only in the long run, vegetable work needs to be grasped tightly year after year and season after season, and vegetable production needs to be continuously consolidated, improved, and appropriately developed; but also from the current point of view, a large amount of vegetables produced must be arranged, used, and stored well, and the current winter vegetable production and preparation for next year's vegetable production must be grasped tightly. Here, we focus on a few issues that should be noted at present.

　　First, plan vegetable consumption and use vegetables appropriately sparingly. In general, there are still several months before the new vegetables are harvested, so we should make practical arrangements for the autumn vegetables that have already been obtained, so as to plan consumption, look ahead and behind, and make it last. In cities, units and residents generally have more vegetables stored for consumption, so commercial departments should control the amount of vegetables on the market, and mainly reserve the commercial vegetables stored by producers and business units for supply next spring. In rural areas, the vegetable consumption of public canteens must also be arranged well, so as not to eat too many vegetables now and have no vegetables to eat next spring, nor to not eat vegetables or eat very few vegetables now and accumulate a large number of vegetables for consumption next spring. When arranging vegetable consumption, attention should also be paid to eating vegetables that are not easy to store first, and storing vegetables that are easy to store as much as possible for future consumption. At the same time, propaganda and education should be carried out among the broad masses and cadres to save vegetables appropriately. Waste of vegetables after the harvest should be prevented, and vegetable stems and leaves that are removed and leftover during harvesting, cellaring, and processing should be utilized as much as possible. Those that can be eaten should be eaten in time or processed and pickled for consumption, and those that cannot be eaten should be used as feed.

　　Another important issue in planning vegetable consumption is that the proportion of commercial vegetables and self-sufficient vegetables in rural people's communes, especially suburban people's communes, should continue to implement the original arrangements in various places. The people's communes should first ensure the supply of vegetables to the cities in accordance with the national plan or the provisions of past contracts. When rural areas need more vegetables for self-consumption and feed, they should mainly solve the problem by tapping local potential, and should not mainly rely on reducing the outward transfer of commercial vegetables. It is necessary to explain to the cadres and masses of the suburban people's communes the great significance of ensuring the supply of vegetables to the cities for supporting urban production, increasing commune accumulation, and promoting the socialist construction of urban and rural areas, and to ensure that the specified commercial vegetables are supplied to the cities.

　　Second, continue to strengthen the leadership of storage work and conduct regular inspections. At present, the number of vegetables stored in urban and rural areas is unprecedentedly huge. These many vegetables are first in the hands of rural people's communes and production teams, secondly in the hands of urban organs, enterprises, schools, and troops, thirdly in the hands of commercial units, and in addition, a considerable number of vegetables are scattered in the homes of urban and rural residents. Among the large number of vegetables stored in all aspects, except for a small part that has been pickled into pickles or dried into dried vegetables, which are relatively easy to store, most of them are fresh vegetables, and storage requires certain equipment and technology. However, many urban organs, enterprises, schools, and troops and some residents rarely stored vegetables in the past and lack storage experience; some rural people's communes and production teams also lack the experience of storing a large number of vegetables. The initial storage situation of autumn vegetables this year is basically good. However, at present, a few units and residents have also experienced some spoilage and losses of stored vegetables due to lack of experience. Doing a good job in storage is the key issue to ensure the supply of vegetables in the next few months, and both urban and rural areas must fully pay attention to this work. According to the experience of some areas, in order to do a good job in storage, leadership organs at all levels should have special personnel in charge at each level, strengthen management, continuously check and compare, and carry out red flag competitions for vegetable storage. At the same time, it is necessary to organize professional teams for vegetable storage, arrange necessary labor, regularly check ventilation, adjust temperature and humidity, and continuously turn and sort. In addition, it is also necessary to help and guide various units and residents to familiarize themselves with storage technology and promote advanced experience in vegetable storage. For example, some suburbs of Beijing have established a "five-level cellar chief system" from the district level to the production team level, with strong cadres in charge at each level, who patrol and inspect every few days, and fixed special storage personnel to ensure frequent turning; at the same time, members of the commune familiar with storage technology are transferred from the suburban communes to help organs, enterprises, schools, etc. solve problems in storage, and vegetable suppliers are assigned to each area to assist nearby units and residents in mastering storage methods. For communes and teams in remote suburbs lacking experience in storing large quantities of vegetables, they are also taught storage techniques through training courses and on-site meetings. These methods are very good and worthy of reference by other regions.

　　Third, seize winter vegetable production and timely plan and prepare for next year's vegetable production. At present, some areas in the south are sowing winter vegetables, and although the north cannot grow a large number of winter vegetables, greenhouses and solar greenhouses have also developed in many areas. All localities should arrange labor to plant and manage winter vegetables well. For vegetable production that requires a lot of labor and is technically demanding, such as greenhouse production, attention should be paid to enriching professional teams. Next year's vegetable production task will be more important than this year's, and all localities should actively and timely plan and prepare for next year's vegetable production on the basis of summarizing this year's experience in vegetable production and high yield. Both urban suburbs and rural areas should determine next year's vegetable fields, carry out basic construction such as water conservancy and transportation, deep plow the land, and apply sufficient base fertilizer. In addition to appropriately increasing the yield of vegetables according to the needs of people eating vegetables and feed, urban suburbs should also pay attention to increasing varieties and gradually and appropriately increase the proportion of fine vegetables. In areas where vegetable seeds are insufficient, they should first be collected from the local masses; if the local area cannot solve the problem, they should be transferred from other places as soon as possible. Commercial departments should do everything possible to supply various means of production to support vegetable production; at the same time, in view of the fact that the vegetable production and sales contracts signed in various places this year have played a beneficial role, the contract system should be further implemented next year.

　　Storing and using the autumn vegetables produced this year well, and doing a good job in winter vegetable and next spring vegetable production is a major event in people's lives this winter and next spring. We must continue to oppose right-leaning ideas and boost our energy, further strengthen leadership and mobilize the masses, and strive to ensure the needs of urban and rural people for vegetables in the next few months, and strive for greater victories on the vegetable front next year.

　　当前蔬菜工作的紧迫任务
    1959年我们在蔬菜生产上获得了巨大的胜利。这一年，绝大多数城市的郊区建立了强大的蔬菜生产基地，战胜了严重的自然灾害，取得了蔬菜的大丰收。城市蔬菜已经做到基本自给；广大农村的蔬菜生产也有了很大的增长，特别是集体生产的蔬菜有了突出的发展。在蔬菜生产大丰收的基础上，全国城乡各地开展了声势浩大的加工和储存蔬菜的群众运动。许多城市动员了市区大量的劳动力和运输力量协助抢收、抢运和储存秋菜；有些城市提出了“城乡协作，公私并举，户户储存，人人动手”和“一院一窖菜，一家一缸菜，片叶不丢，棵菜不烂”等口号，发动市区和郊区广大群众大量加工和储藏蔬菜。根据北方六十三个城市的统计，可供今冬明春食用的蔬菜共储存了八十二亿斤，比去年增加两倍左右。目前供应状况一般是充裕的。各大中城市目前每人每天一般可以吃到一斤到一斤半菜。农村中公共食堂一般比城市吃到更多的菜，许多水利建设工地也能充分供应，这对于调剂伙食、改善营养起了重要的作用。所有这些都充分说明了，由于党中央和毛主席的重视和关怀，由于各级党委加强领导，开展了大规模的群众运动，1959年我们在蔬菜战线上打了一个大胜仗。
    但是，能不能认为蔬菜工作已经“过关”，从此可以高枕无忧了呢？不，不能这样认为。不但从长期来看，蔬菜工作需要年年抓紧、季季抓紧，蔬菜生产需要继续巩固、提高和适当发展；而且从目前来看，生产出来大量蔬菜还必须安排好、使用好、保管好，当前的冬菜生产和明年蔬菜生产的准备工作还必须抓紧进行。这里，我们着重谈谈目前应当注意的几个问题。
    第一是，计划用菜，适当节约用菜。目前一般地区距离新菜收获还有几个月，应当把已经拿到手里的秋菜进行切实的安排，做到计划消费，瞻前顾后，细水长流。在城市，目前各单位和居民一般都存有比较多的蔬菜可以食用，因此商业部门应当掌握蔬菜上市的数量，把生产者和经营单位储存的商品菜主要留到明年春天供应。在农村，也必须把公共食堂的吃菜安排好，既不要目前吃菜过多以致明春没有菜吃，也不要目前不吃菜或很少吃菜而把大量蔬菜积压到明年春季食用。在安排吃菜的时候，还应当注意先吃不容易保管的蔬菜，把容易保管的蔬菜尽量储存起来，留待将来食用。同时，要在广大群众和干部中进行宣传教育，适当节约蔬菜。要防止在丰收以后浪费蔬菜，还要把收获、窖藏和加工过程中剔出和剩余的菜帮菜叶尽可能利用起来，能够吃的，要及时作为食用或者加工腌制以后食用，不能吃的用作饲料。
    在计划用菜方面还有一个重要问题，就是农村人民公社、特别是城市郊区人民公社对于商品蔬菜和自给蔬菜的比例，应当继续贯彻执行各地原来的安排。人民公社应当按照国家计划或过去合同的规定，首先保证城市的蔬菜供应。农村需要更多蔬菜自食和用作饲料时，主要应当从当地挖掘潜力来解决，而不应当主要依靠减少外调商品菜来解决。要向郊区人民公社的干部和群众讲明白保证城市蔬菜供应对于支援城市生产、增加公社积累、推进城乡的社会主义建设的重大意义，保证把规定的商品蔬菜供应城市。
    第二是，继续加强对保管工作的领导，经常进行检查。目前城乡储存蔬菜的数量空前巨大。这许多蔬菜，首先是在农村人民公社和生产队的手里，其次是在城市的机关、企业、学校、部队手里，再次是在商业单位手里，另外，还有相当多的蔬菜分散在城乡居民家里。各方面储存的大量蔬菜里面，除了一小部分已经腌成咸菜或晒成干菜，比较容易保管以外，大部分都是鲜菜，保管需要有一定的设备和技术。而城市的许多机关、企业、学校、部队和一部分居民过去很少储存蔬菜，缺乏保管的经验；部分地区的农村人民公社和生产队也缺乏保管大量蔬菜的经验。今年秋菜的初期保管情况基本上是好的。但是，目前有少数单位和居民由于经验不足，所储存的蔬菜也发生了一些腐坏和损失的现象。做好保管工作是今后几个月保证蔬菜供应的关键问题，不论城市和农村都要充分重视这个工作。根据一些地区的经验，要做好保管工作，各级领导机关要层层有专人负责，加强管理，不断检查评比，开展蔬菜保管的红旗竞赛。同时要组织保管蔬菜的专业队伍，安排必要的劳动力，经常检查通风状况，调整温度、湿度，不断进行翻倒和整理。此外，还要帮助和指导各单位和居民熟悉保管技术，推广保管蔬菜的先进经验。例如，北京市一些郊区从区一级开始，直到生产小队，建立了“五级窖长制”，层层都有强有力的干部负责，几天就巡回检查一次，固定了专门的保管人员，保证经常翻倒；同时，从郊区公社抽调熟悉保管技术的社员，帮助机关、企业、学校等解决储存中的问题，由蔬菜供应商店分片包干，协助附近单位和居民掌握保管方法，对远郊区缺乏大量储存蔬菜经验的社队，也通过举办训练班、召开现场会议等办法传授保管技术。这些办法都是很好的，值得其他地区参考。
    第三，抓紧冬菜生产，及时规划和准备明年蔬菜生产。目前南方一部分地区正在播种冬菜，北方虽然不能大量种植冬菜，但许多地区的温室和阳畦也有了发展。各地都应当安排劳动力，把冬菜种好、管好，对于费工多、技术性强的蔬菜生产，例如温室生产，更要注意充实专业队伍。明年蔬菜生产任务比今年更加重大，各地要在总结今年蔬菜工作丰产经验的基础上，积极地及时地规划和准备来年蔬菜生产。城市郊区和农村都要确定明年的菜田，进行水利、交通等基本建设，深翻土地，施足底肥。除了根据人们吃菜和饲料的需要适当增加蔬菜的产量以外，城市郊区还要注意增加品种，逐步地适当地提高细菜的比重。蔬菜种籽不足的地方，首先要在当地群众中设法收集；当地无法解决的，应当及早从外地调剂。商业部门应当千方百计地供应各种生产资料，支援蔬菜生产；同时，鉴于今年各地订立的蔬菜产销合同都起了有益的作用，明年还应当进一步贯彻合同制度。
    把今年生产的秋菜储存好、使用好，把冬菜和明年春季蔬菜生产搞好，这是今冬明春人民生活中的一件大事。我们必须继续反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步加强领导、发动群众，努力保证今后几个月中城乡人民对蔬菜的需要，并且争取明年在蔬菜战线上获得更大的胜利。
