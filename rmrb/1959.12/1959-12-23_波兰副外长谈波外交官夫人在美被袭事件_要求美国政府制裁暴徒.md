Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 22nd. Polish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Naszkowski discussed the incident of American thugs attacking the wife of the Second Secretary of the Polish Embassy in Washington at a meeting of the Polish Parliament on the 21st.

He said that three weeks have passed since the incident occurred, but neither the Polish Embassy in Washington nor the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received any information about the results of the investigation, and the thugs are still at large. He then pointed out that this incident shows that there are still forces in the United States that oppose the policy of easing international tensions and oppose friendly Polish-American relations. Naszkowski said that it is clear that if the US government hopes to resolve this matter and prevent the continued development of Polish-American relations from being affected, then the only way is to solve the case of the thugs attacking the wife of the Polish diplomat as soon as possible and give them severe sanctions.

He finally pointed out that in order to achieve results that satisfy Polish society, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to take the necessary steps.

As previously reported, the incident occurred on November 29th. On that morning, three thugs broke into the home of Chayel, the Second Secretary of the Polish Embassy. They maliciously instigated Chayel's wife, asked him some provocative questions, and searched everywhere. Finally, disregarding the hostess's request for them to leave, the thugs beat her unconscious.

　　波兰副外长谈波外交官夫人在美被袭事件
    要求美国政府制裁暴徒
    新华社华沙22日电　波兰外交部副部长纳希科夫斯基21日在波兰议会会议上谈到了美国暴徒袭击波兰驻华盛顿大使馆二等秘书的夫人的事件。
    他说，这件事发生以后，已经过去三周了，可是波兰驻华盛顿大使馆和波兰外交部均未得到任何关于这件事的侦察的结果，暴徒仍然逍遥法外。他接着指出，这一事件说明，在美国仍然存在着反对国际局势缓和政策和反对波美友好关系的势力。纳希科夫斯基说，很显然，如果美国政府方面希望解决这件事，不使波美关系的继续发展受到影响，那么，唯一的途径是尽快地破获暴徒袭击波兰外交官夫人事件，而且给予他们以严厉的制裁。
    他最后指出，为了取得使波兰社会满意的结果，波兰外交部将继续采取必要的步骤。
    前已报道，这个事件是在11月29日发生的。当天早晨，有三名歹徒闯进波兰大使馆二等秘书恰耶尔的家中。他们对恰耶尔的夫人进行恶意煽动，向他提出一些挑衅性的问题，并且到处搜索。歹徒最后不顾女主人要他们离去的要求，竟然把她殴打得失去知觉。
