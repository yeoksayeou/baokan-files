    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 5th. Wuhan City recently adopted the method of combining professional transportation teams with the mobilization of all forces to support and cooperate in a concentrated effort to transport and unload the backlog of materials at ports and stations. This has rapidly eliminated congestion at ports and stations, significantly reduced the accumulation of materials, and ensured the smooth flow of vehicles and ships.
    Since September and October, the sharply increased volume of industrial and agricultural materials has converged on Wuhan, the center of combined water and land transport. Although the handling capacity of Wuhan Port and Stations has increased sevenfold compared to 1949, thanks to several years of reconstruction, expansion, and major technological innovations, it still cannot meet the needs. Due to insufficient transport capacity and throughput, the materials transported to Wuhan from various regions accumulated at the port and stations. By November 25th, the accumulated materials (excluding those used within the city) exceeded the maximum capacity of the port and station warehouses and yards by more than twofold. More than two hundred and eighty fully loaded vessels and barges were also anchored in the river, unable to unload in time.
    On November 25th, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an emergency mobilization order, calling on the entire city's population to assist professional transportation teams in a concentrated effort to transport the accumulated materials. On the same day, under the specific organization of the Municipal Party Committee, various government agencies, organizations, military units, and residents actively signed up to participate in the concentrated transport effort. Subsequently, led by leading cadres at all levels, approximately 30,000 people were mobilized daily to fight alongside tens of thousands of professional transport workers on the dozens of miles of front lines along both banks of the Yangtze River in Wuhan and at various stations. In the week from November 26th to December 2nd, 540,000 tons of materials were loaded and unloaded, with the mass mobilization teams handling 233,000 tons. This reversed the congestion situation within a few days, transferring the accumulated materials at the port and stations to cargo owners or to other open spaces, freeing up some warehouses and yards for new arrivals. The transfer of materials within the city to locations convenient for loading onto trucks also accelerated the turnaround of vehicles and ships. Supported and encouraged by the mass mobilization teams, professional transport teams continuously innovated tools within a few days, increasing loading and unloading efficiency by 20% to 30%.

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 5th. Recently, in order to overcome ice and snow and ensure the continued leap forward in steel production, a transportation campaign to rush unloading, rush dispatch, rush loading, and sweep snow on the Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel) transportation lines, has rapidly reversed the tense transportation situation that emerged in late November. Currently, over one thousand railcars that had been backlogged on the Ansteel transportation lines have been dispatched. The congestion of freight cars at stations and loading/unloading yards along the lines has been cleared. Coal and ore transported from various regions, as well as steel transported from Ansteel to various regions, are now flowing smoothly. In the first three days of December, the average turnaround time for railway vehicles was reduced to 17.12 minutes, and the number of railway vehicles retained at Ansteel was reduced to 1,651.
    On November 23rd, Anshan was hit by heavy snow and severe cold. Ground facilities such as rails and switches were buried under more than a foot of snow. Coal and ore powder transported to Ansteel from various regions were frozen inside the railcars, making unloading difficult and causing transportation blockages and a shortage of raw material supplies. During the most severe four days from November 24th to 27th, the average turnaround time for railway vehicles was as long as 42.30 minutes, almost double the state plan. The average daily number of railway vehicles retained at Ansteel was 3,652, a rare phenomenon in recent years. This situation threatened the normal production of Ansteel.
    The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Ansteel Party Committee called on all districts and factories and mines within the city to unite as one, fight against the severe cold, and launch a transportation campaign to rush unloading, rush dispatch, and rush loading. Thousands of cadres, students, citizens, and workers immediately responded to the Municipal Party Committee's call and formed snow-sweeping teams. After two days and nights of hard work, the accumulated snow was cleared. Loading and unloading workers from the Ansteel Transportation Department and farmers, workers, and citizens drawn from three urban districts, seventeen factories and mines, and five people's communes formed a nearly 6,000-person loading and unloading team, which was dispatched to loading and unloading yards along the railway lines. The loading and unloading team members put forward the slogan "Overcome the severe cold, load and unload quickly, and ensure steel and iron production," and enthusiastically launched a competition. Workers from the Third and Fourth Shifts of the Xibajiazi Loading and Unloading Yard of Ansteel engaged in a competition to unload frozen railcars. The workers of the Third Shift spent only 1 hour and 40 minutes unloading a frozen railcar, and the workers of the Fourth Shift also completed the task ahead of schedule in 1 hour and 45 minutes.
    In order to quickly reverse the transportation situation, the Ansteel Transportation Department and the sintering plant, chemical plant, power plant, Donganshan iron mine and other factories and mines carried out inter-factory cooperation competitions, twisting production and transportation into one rope, both ensuring steel and iron production and freeing up a large number of railcars. In the joint rush loading, unloading, and dispatching by employees of the Ansteel Transportation Department, the sintering plant, and the Anshan Station of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, the three-quick method of quick sorting, quick pickup and delivery, and quick unloading of goods was implemented, speeding up unloading and ensuring production. At present, the congestion and backlog on the Ansteel transportation front have been reversed, and transportation order is normal. Transportation department employees are vigorously carrying out a mass movement centered on stations to improve the efficiency and safety of shunting operations, and are organizing the transportation of raw materials and spare parts required for production in December this year and January next year to ensure the continued leap forward in production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, December 5th. Commercial departments in Guizhou Province are vigorously promoting "piggyback" transportation to deliver large quantities of agricultural and sideline products to cities and industrial and mining areas in a timely manner to meet the needs of the people's lives.

    Guizhou Province has achieved a bumper harvest of agricultural and sideline products this year, and commercial materials have greatly increased, with the volume of shipments increasing by about 30% compared to last year. The volume of materials to be shipped in the fourth quarter reached more than one million tons, exceeding two-thirds of the total volume shipped in the second half of last year.

    In order to distribute these agricultural and sideline products to consumers in cities and industrial and mining areas in a timely manner, the commercial and transportation departments of Guizhou Province decided to promote the experience of "piggyback" transportation. Starting in April, they first conducted experiments on automobile transportation, and after gaining experience, they quickly expanded it to aviation, railways, ox and horse carts, wooden boats, and animal power. From April to mid-November, the province piggybacked more than 400,000 tons of materials, of which the total volume of piggybacked materials from April to September accounted for about 60% of the total volume of automobile transportation during the same period, which is equivalent to the transportation volume of more than 1,000 four-ton trucks in a month.

    The widespread development of piggyback transportation in Guizhou Province is the result of common emphasis and mutual assistance from commercial departments, transportation departments, and relevant units. Leaders of the Transportation Bureau of the Provincial Department of Transportation led a working group to conduct key experiments in the Zunyi area, gained experience, and promoted it. The Provincial Department of Commerce also established piggyback transportation transfer stations and a piggyback transportation command, and transferred cadres to various places to establish a piggyback transportation network. More than 200 piggyback consignment stations have been established throughout the province, basically forming a piggyback transportation network of trunk and branch lines for highways and waterways.

    After these piggyback consignment stations were established, the Provincial Department of Commerce compiled and issued monthly piggyback transportation plans to various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, counties, and cities based on the total monthly volume of materials to be transported. These units then distributed the planned targets layer by layer to stations and teams based on the accumulation of agricultural and sideline products, and then mobilized them to carry out red flag competitions between special zones, between counties, between cities, and between stations.

    In order to ensure the completion of the piggyback transportation plan, commercial departments in various places "visited tirelessly and ran tirelessly," actively contacted units with vehicles and ships, grasped the dynamics of vehicles and ships, filled in gaps whenever possible, and seized every opportunity. Because they worked proactively and helped transportation departments solve the problem of vehicle and ship parts in a timely manner, and solved the problem of food and lodging for drivers, they received strong support from various units. In just two months, the Provincial Department of Commerce alone hooked up with thirty-two vehicle-owning units and negotiated the piggyback transport of more than 1,000 vehicles. Now, the province basically ensures that vehicles never run empty, ships never sail empty, and horses never carry an empty saddle.

    Various places have paid attention to simplifying procedures and doing a good job in preparing for piggyback transportation. Commercial departments have contacted short-distance transportation teams and people's communes, seized the opportunity, and transported agricultural and sideline products to the water and land lines or docks in a timely manner to ensure that goods are waiting for vehicles. In Meitan, Suiyang, Dafang, and Guiding and other places, due to the good preparations, the entire process of piggyback transportation from loading to completing procedures generally takes no more than half an hour for a full truckload. In the development of piggyback transportation, attention has also been paid to improving the settlement methods for piggyback fees to make them simple and fast.

    Now, activities to find piggyback transportation methods have been further launched throughout the province. For example, according to the characteristics of "driving pigs, cattle, and sheep forward one station," the Zunyi area uses castrated cattle to carry some agricultural and sideline products into the city, and the amount of agricultural and sideline products piggybacked to Guiyang City alone is more than 60 tons per day.

    武汉和鞍山组织各方力量突击装卸和搬运物资
    贵州建立公路水路捎脚运输网，做到车不空驶船不空行马不空鞍
    本报武汉5日电　武汉市最近采用了专业运输队伍和组织各方面力量支援协作的方法，大力突击搬运和装卸港口、车站积压的物资，使港、站堵塞现象迅速消除，积压物资大量减少，车船来去畅通无阻。
    9、10月份以来急剧增长的工农业物资，通过长、短途运输云集到水陆联运中心的武汉市。经过几年改建扩建和大搞技术革新的武汉港、站，虽然吞吐能力已比1949年提高了七倍，但仍不能满足需要。各地运到武汉的物资，由于现有运力和吞吐量的不足，到11月25日为止，港、站积存的物资（不包括市内使用物资）已超过港站仓库场地最大容量的两倍。有二百八十多艘满载的轮、驳，也因来不及卸货而停泊江中。
    中共湖北省委在11月25日发出紧急动员令，号召全市人民协助专业运输队伍，突击搬运积压物资。当天，在市委的具体组织下，各机关、团体、部队、居民纷纷报名参加突击搬运。随后，由各级领导干部带头，每天出动三万人左右，在武汉长江两岸和各车站上的几十里战线上，同数万专业运输队伍并肩奋战。从11月26日到12月2日的一周里，装卸了五十四万吨物资，其中群众队伍的搬运量达到二十三万三千吨。这样，几天内就扭转了堵塞的局面，把积存在港、站上的物资转给货主或转运到其他空地，腾出了部分仓库和场地，使新到物资有地方堆存，把市内物资转运到便于装汽车的地方，加快了车船周转。专业运输队伍在群众突击队伍的支援和鼓舞下，几天里不断改革工具，使装卸效率提高20％至30％。
    本报鞍山5日电　最近，鞍钢运输线上为了战胜冰雪严寒，确保钢铁生产继续跃进，掀起了抢卸、抢排、抢装和大扫雪的运输突击运动，迅速扭转了11月下旬出现的运输紧张局面。现在，鞍钢运输线路上积压的一千多个车皮已经排送出去；沿线车站和装卸货场的货车堵塞，都已疏通了。各地运来的煤炭、矿石和鞍钢运往各地的钢材，也都畅通无阻。12月份头三天，局车一次作业时间平均压缩到十七点十二分钟；路局车辆在鞍钢的保有量也已压缩到一千六百五十一辆。
    11月23日，鞍山遭受大雪、严寒侵袭，路轨、道岔等地面设施都被厚达一尺多深的大雪所埋没，各地运到鞍钢的煤炭、矿粉都被冻结在车内，卸车困难，产生了运输堵塞、原料供应不上的现象。在最严重的11月24
  日到27日四天中，局车一次作业时间平均长达四十二点三十分钟，超过国家计划几乎一倍；路局车辆在鞍钢的保有量平均每天有三千六百五十二辆，这是近几年来罕有的现象。这种情况，威胁了鞍钢的正常生产。
    中共鞍山市委和鞍钢党委号召市内各区和鞍钢各厂矿万众一心，跟严寒搏斗，开展抢卸、抢排、抢装的运输突击运动。成千上万名机关干部、学生、市民、工人立即响应市委号召，组成了扫雪突击队，经过两昼夜的艰苦努力，就把积雪清除干净了。鞍钢运输部装卸工人和从三个市区、十七个厂矿、五个人民公社抽调的农民、工人、市民，共同组成一支近六千人的装卸货物突击队，开赴铁路沿线装卸货场。装卸队员们提出“战胜严寒、快装快卸、保钢保铁”的口号，热烈展开竞赛。鞍钢西八家子装卸场第三、第四两班工人展开卸冻结车的对手赛。第三班工人卸一个冻结车只用了一点四十分钟，第四班工人也用一点四十五分钟提前完成任务。
    为了迅速扭转运输局面，鞍钢运输部和烧结总厂、化工总厂、发电厂、东鞍山铁矿等厂矿开展了厂际协作赛，把生产和运输拧成一股绳，既保钢保铁，又腾出大量车皮。鞍钢运输部、烧结总厂与沈阳铁路局鞍山车站职工在联合抢装抢卸抢排当中，实行了货物快编组、快取送、快卸车的三快方法，加快了卸车，又保证了生产。目前，鞍钢运输战线上堵塞和积压现象已经扭转，运输秩序正常。运输部门职工正在大力开展以车站为中心的提高倒调作业效率和安全正点的群众运动，组织运输今年12月份和明年1月份生产所需的原料和备料，保证生产继续跃进。
    本报贵阳5日电　贵州省商业部门大搞捎脚运输，把大批农副产品及时运送到城市和工矿区，满足人民生活需要。
    贵州省今年农副产品普遍丰收，商业物资大大增加，调运量比去年增长30％左右。第四季度的调运物资达一百多万吨，超过去年下半年总运量的三分之二。
    为了把这些农副产品及时分送到城市和工矿区消费者的手中，贵州省商业和运输部门决定推广捎脚运输的经验。从4月份开始，他们先在汽车运输上作试验，取得经验后，迅速扩大到航空、铁路、牛马板车、木船和畜力等方面。4月到11月中旬，全省捎运的物资达四十多万吨，其中4至9月捎运的物资总量，占同期汽车总运量的60％左右，约等于一千多辆载重四吨汽车一个月的运输总量。
    贵州省捎脚运输的广泛开展，是商业部门和运输部门以及有关单位共同重视、互相协助的结果。省交通厅运输局的领导人，率领工作组，深入遵义地区进行重点试验，取得经验，加以推广。省商业厅也建立了捎脚运输接转站和捎脚运输指挥部，抽调干部到各地建立捎脚运输网。全省已建立起捎脚托运站二百多个，基本上构成一个公路、水路的支、干线捎运网。
    这些捎脚托运站建立起来后，省商业厅根据每月物资总运量，按月编制捎运计划并下达各专、州、县、市，再由这些单位根据农副产品的蓄积情况，将计划指标逐层下达到站、组，然后发动他们开展专区与专区、县与县、市与市、站与站之间的红旗竞赛。
    各地商业部门为了保证完成捎运计划，“百访不厌、百跑不烦”，主动和各有车有船单位取得联系，掌握车船的动态，有空即补，见缝插针。由于他们工作主动，并及时帮助运输部门解决车船的配件，给驾驶人员解决食宿等问题，因而得到各单位的大力支持。仅省商业厅在两个月的时间中，便和三十二个有车单位挂上钩，商妥捎运的汽车就有一千多辆。现在，全省基本上做到车不空驶，船不空行，马不空鞍。
    各地都注意简化手续和做好捎运的准备工作。商业部门和短途运输队、人民公社取得联系，抓紧时机，及时把农副产品运到水、陆沿线或码头，做到货等车。湄潭、绥阳、大方和贵定等地，由于准备工作做得好，一般整车捎运从装货到办手续，都不超过半小时。在开展捎脚运输中，还注意改进捎脚费用的结算方法，做到简便迅速。
    现在，全省各地已进一步掀起了寻找捎运窍门的活动。例如遵义专区根据“猪、牛、羊向前赶一站”的特点，利用菜牛顺驮一部分农副产品入城，每天仅捎到贵阳市的农副产品就在六十吨以上。（附图片）
