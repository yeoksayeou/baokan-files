Local Newspaper Commentary Excerpts:

    The experience of "simplification, voltage increase, and ring network power supply" in power distribution systems is a new development in our province's electric power industry and electricity consumption; it is a major technological innovation in the electrical equipment of industrial and mining enterprises. This experience has created extremely favorable conditions for ensuring the sufficient power needed for the sustained and comprehensive leap forward in industrial production, and for achieving "more supply, less loss, safety, and conservation."
    Due to the limitations of past technical conditions, the original designs of electrical equipment in many industrial and mining enterprises in our province were unreasonable. In addition, a large number of electrical equipment have been added successively, resulting in some irrational phenomena in the layout and use of electrical equipment. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, the original electrical equipment in most enterprises has been operating at full load or even overload, which has affected the continuous improvement of production. Therefore, actively reforming electrical equipment has become an urgent task. The emergence of the Hongqi Chemical Plant's experience of "simplification, voltage increase, and ring network power supply" in power distribution systems, and the creative application of this experience by units such as the Harbin Wire Factory, have provided relatively complete experience for industrial and mining enterprises to reform their electrical equipment.
    At present, the production of electrical materials still cannot meet the needs of all parties. Under these circumstances, fully tapping the potential of enterprises' existing electrical equipment and materials can better support agriculture in accelerating the realization of electrification. Only the Harbin Wire Factory and the Provincial Party School, through promoting this experience, dismantled transformers, wires, oil switches, and other equipment, which are enough to equip a water conservancy irrigation station for 37,500 mu of paddy fields with the necessary electrical equipment. Preliminary estimates indicate that if this experience can be promoted throughout the province, 50,000 kVA of transformers, 400,000 meters of various specifications of wires, and other electrical equipment and materials can be tapped. If these equipment and materials are used to support rural electrification, they are enough to provide the electrical equipment needed for lighting for 1.2 million rural households (calculated at 40 watts per household).
    Promoting the experience of "simplification, voltage increase, and ring network power supply" in power distribution systems can increase the capacity of power supply equipment, reduce power loss, save national expenditure, and meet the requirements of more power supply and less power loss. Before promoting the Hongqi Chemical Plant's experience, the Harbin Wire Factory was often seriously affected in its production due to unsafe electricity consumption. By promoting this experience, the voltage was increased, which not only improved the transmission capacity and eliminated the problem of line overload, but also ensured the voltage quality, increased the machine speed, and increased the daily output by 15% compared with before the voltage increase. At the same time, due to the increase in voltage, power loss was also reduced, so that effective power can be saved and applied to businesses that urgently need electricity. After the Harbin Wire Factory did this, it can reduce the loss of 730,000 kWh of electricity per year. What a considerable figure this is!
    Promoting the experience of "simplification, voltage increase, and ring network power supply" in power distribution systems can also improve the safety and reliability of electricity consumption and ensure uninterrupted power supply for industrial production. Some people are still worried about whether there will be problems if so much equipment is dismantled. The experience of the Harbin Wire Factory proves that unified voltage levels and ring network power supply not only do not cause problems, but also solve the problem of backup power supply in production and increase the safety and reliability of electricity consumption. In the past, most of this factory used workshops as units to set up dedicated lines and dedicated transformers; moreover, due to the complexity of the electrical equipment in the factory and the many voltage levels, once an accident occurred, power could not be supplied to each other because the voltage was not unified, and production had to be stopped. This problem was solved after unified voltage levels and ring network power supply were implemented. When a substation or line fails, it can be powered by another line to ensure the normal progress of production, and because the equipment is simplified, the possibility of accidents is greatly reduced.
    The experience of "simplification, voltage increase, and ring network power supply" in the power distribution system of the Harbin Wire Factory can not only be vigorously promoted in industrial and mining enterprises, but also be widely promoted in government agencies, schools, and other units. The Provincial Party School, after promoting this experience, simplified the substation and implemented mixed power supply for power and lighting, resulting in a reduction from the original 24 lines to 4 lines, and the dismantling of 2,500 meters of wires of different specifications and many electrical materials, which is proof of this.
    In order to promote this experience well, it is first necessary to educate cadres and workers to correctly understand the great political and economic significance of promoting this experience. In practice, we should adopt the method of first easy and then difficult, first simple and then complex, according to the specific circumstances of our units, and proceed with leadership, planning, and preparation. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, scientific research departments and electricity departments in various regions should cooperate closely with relevant departments to specifically help industrial and mining enterprises solve the technical problems encountered in the promotion.

### 大力推行改革配电系统的经验

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    大力推行改革配电系统的经验
    配电系统“简化、升压、环形供电”的经验，是我省电力工业和用电事业中出现的新鲜事物；是工矿企业用电设备上的一项重大的技术革新。这一经验对于保证工业生产持续全面跃进所需要的充足的电力，对于实现“多供少损安全节约”创造了极为有利的条件。
    我省许多工矿企业的用电设备，由于过去技术条件的限制，原来设计的不合理，加之又陆续增加了大量电气设备，致使电气设备的布置与使用方式存在着一些不合理的现象。特别是大跃进以来，多数企业原有的电气设备已满负荷甚至超负荷运转，影响了生产的不断提高。因此，积极进行用电设备的改革就成为当前迫不及待的任务。红旗化工厂“配电系统简化、升压、环形供电”经验的出现，和哈尔滨电线厂等单位对此经验的创造性的应用，为工矿企业改革用电设备，提供了较为完整的经验。
    当前在电工器材的生产上还满足不了各方面的需要。在这种情况下，充分挖掘企业现有电气设备和器材的潜力，就可以更好地支援农业加快实现电气化。仅哈尔滨电线厂和省委党校两处推广这个经验，拆下来的变压器、电线、油开关等设备，用来支援农业生产，就足够装备一个三万七千五百亩稻田的水利灌溉站所需的电气设备。初步预计，如果全省范围内都能推行这一经验，就可以挖掘出变压器五万千伏安，各种不同规格的电线四十万米以及其他用电设备和材料。这些设备和材料，如用它来支援农村电气化，足够一百二十万农户的照明用电（每户以四十瓦计算）所需要的电气设备。
    推行配电系统“简化、升压、环形供电”经验，可以提高供电设备容量，减少电力损失，节约国家开支，符合多供电、少损电的要求。哈尔滨电线厂在推广红旗化工厂经验以前，因用电不安全，常常严重地影响生产。通过推行这一经验，升高电压以后，不仅提高了输电能力，消除了线路过负荷的问题，而且保证了电压质量，机器转速加快了，日产量较升压前提高了百分之十五。同时，由于升高电压，也减少了电力损失，这样就可以把有效的电力节约下来，应用到迫切需要电力的事业上去。哈尔滨电线厂这样作了之后，一年即可减少损失电量七十三万度。这是多么可观的数字啊！
    推行配电系统“简化、升压、环形供电”经验，还可以提高用电安全的可靠性，保证工业生产不间断地用电。现在还有人顾虑拆掉那么多设备会不会出问题。哈尔滨电线厂的经验证明，通过统一电压等级实行环形供电不仅不会出问题，而且还能解决生产上的备用电源，更增加了用电安全的可靠性。这个厂过去多数是以车间为单位设专用线路和专用变压器；而且由于厂内的电气设备复杂，电压等级繁多，因此，一旦发生事故，就因为电压不统一而不能相互供电，只好停产。统一电压等级实行环形供电以后，就解决了这个问题。当某一变电所或线路发生故障，就可以由另外线路供电，保证生产的正常进行，并且由于简化设备，也使发生事故的可能性大大减少。
    哈尔滨电线厂配电系统“简化、升压、环形供电”的经验不仅可以在工矿企业大力推行，而且也可以在机关、学校等单位广泛推行。省委党校由于经过推行这个经验，简化了变电所，实行动力、照明混合供电，结果由原来二十四趟线减少到四趟线，拆下了不同规格的电线二千五百米和许多电气器材的事实就是个证明。
    为了推行好这一经验，首先要教育干部和职工正确认识推行这一经验的重大政治意义和经济意义。在做法上应根据本单位的具体情况采取先易后难、先简后繁的方法，有领导、有计划、有准备地进行。各地区科学研究部门和电业部门要在党委的领导下，与有关部门密切协作，具体帮助各工矿企业解决在推行中遇到的技术问题。
