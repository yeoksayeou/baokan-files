    Seriously Do a Good Job in Winter Fire Prevention

    In winter, due to the sharp increase in the use of electricity and fire for production and heating, coupled with dry weather, fires are most likely to occur. This requires us to be highly vigilant and conscientiously do a good job in winter fire prevention. The reports in today's newspaper about the long-term absence of fires in Daowai District of Harbin City, Taokeng People's Commune in Chaling County, Hunan Province, and Xiangtan Power Plant in Hunan Province, all illustrate that as long as we resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party committee, follow the mass line, conduct serious investigation and research, fully grasp the laws of fire occurrence, and continuously adopt various practical and effective root-cause treatment measures, we can not only completely change the situation of increased fires in winter and reduce fires to a minimum, but also completely eliminate fires for a long period of time, and create many fire-free safe areas and safe units.

    At present, in order to do a good job in winter fire prevention, all regions have actively taken action, and on the basis of fully mobilizing and relying on the masses, have launched a safety inspection campaign centered on fire prevention, which will play an important role in preventing fire hazards. However, some people do not have a sufficient understanding of this, and believe that "a major safety inspection campaign has already been carried out, and a large number of fire hazard loopholes have been blocked, and there is nothing more to do now," and that "we can breathe a sigh of relief." This kind of thinking is wrong. It should be recognized that the struggle against fire is a long-term and arduous task. Fire factors are constantly changing with the development and changes of production, as well as the changes of the seasons. Old fire hazards are resolved, and new fire hazards will arise; this loophole is blocked, and another loophole may appear. Therefore, it is impossible to imagine that just conducting one or two campaigns can solve the problem once and for all, and we must constantly mobilize and rely on the broad masses, adopt the method of discovery - solution - re-discovery - re-solution, and carry out unremitting struggle against fire.

    Industrial and mining enterprises in various regions are now working hard to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule, exceeding the target in all areas, and preparing to achieve continued leaps forward next year. The water conservancy construction movement has also been launched on a large scale in various regions. Many industrial and mining enterprises and water conservancy construction sites attach importance to production and also attach importance to fire prevention and safety; however, some places neglect safety work, which is not right. Experience has proved that the more intense the production, the more attention should be paid to safety. The long-term elimination of fires in Daowai District of Harbin, Xiangtan Power Plant in Hunan, and Taokeng People's Commune in Chaling County vividly proves that the kind of thinking that sets production against safety, and believes that "it doesn't matter if a fire occurs," is a manifestation of paralysis and right-leaning thoughts, and a manifestation that the enthusiasm has not yet been fully mobilized. It should be overcome. We must firmly establish the idea that "safety is for production, and production must be safe," vigorously implement the policy of "grasping production with one hand and grasping safety with the other," strive to avoid accidental losses, and do a good job in production.

    Strengthening the fire safety work of the People's Commune is also very important. At present, agricultural products have been collected and stored in a centralized manner, and once a fire occurs, it may cause great losses. Therefore, propaganda and inspection work should be carried out in the People's Commune in a planned manner, and areas that are prone to fires and are likely to cause major losses and casualties after a fire, such as agricultural product warehouses, farm implement warehouses, commune-run industrial enterprises, nurseries, public canteens, and livestock sheds, should be listed as the focus of work, and a thorough inspection should be carried out to eliminate fire hazards.

    In short, winter fire prevention is very important. It is recommended that all regions and departments grasp this work well, adopt various effective measures, do it well, and ensure the continued leap forward in people's lives and various construction undertakings.

### 认真做好冬季防火工作

    认真做好冬季防火工作
    冬季由于生产、生活取暖用电用火骤增，加以天气干燥，最易发生火灾。这就要求我们必须提高警惕，认真地做好冬季防火工作。今天本报报道的哈尔滨市道外区、湖南茶陵县桃坑人民公社和湖南湘潭发电厂长期无火灾的情况，都可以说明：只要坚决依靠党委领导，走群众路线，认真地进行调查研究，充分掌握火灾发生的规律，不断地采取各种切实有效的根治措施，不仅完全可以改变冬季火灾增多的情况，使火灾减少到最低限度，而且完全可以在一个长时期内消灭火灾，出现许多无火灾的安全地区和安全单位。
    目前，各地为了做好冬季防火工作，都已积极行动起来，在充分发动和依靠群众的基础上，开展了以防火为中心的安全检查运动，这对于制止火灾危害，会起重要的作用。但是还有些人对此认识不足，认为“已经搞过安全大检查运动，大量的火险漏洞已被堵塞，现在再没有什么可搞的了”“可以松一口气了”，这种思想是不对的。应当认识到同火灾的斗争是一项长期艰巨的任务。火灾因素是随着生产的发展变化，以及季节的变化而不断变化的，旧的火险解决了，新的火险又会产生；这一个漏洞堵塞了，另一个漏洞又可能出现，因此，决不能设想只搞一二次运动就可以一劳永逸，而必须不断地发动和依靠广大群众，采取发现——解决——再发现——再解决的方法，同火灾进行不懈的斗争。
    各地工矿企业现在正在为提前超额全面完成今年计划和准备实现明年继续跃进而努力，水利建设运动也已经在各地波澜壮阔地开展起来。很多工矿企业和水利工地是重视生产也重视防火和安全的；但也有个别地方对安全工作有些忽视，这是不对的。经验证明，生产越是紧张，就越要注意安全。哈尔滨道外区、湖南湘潭发电厂和茶陵县桃坑人民公社长期消灭了火灾，就生动地证明了那种把生产和安全对立起来，认为“发生点火灾，不算什么”的认识，是麻痹和右倾思想在作怪，是干劲还没有鼓足的表现。应当克服它，必须坚定地树立“安全为了生产，生产必须安全”的思想，大力贯彻“一手抓生产，一手抓安全”的方针，力求避免意外损失，搞好生产。
    加强人民公社的防火安全工作也很重要，目前农产品多已集中收藏，一旦起火就可能造成很大损失。因此，应该有计划地在人民公社中开展宣传和检查工作，把一些容易发生火灾和发生火灾后易于造成大损失和人身伤亡的部位，如农产品仓库、农具仓库、社办工业企业、托儿所、公共食堂、牲畜棚等处所，列为工作的重点，彻底检查一次，堵绝火患。
    总之，冬季防火很要紧。建议各地区和各部门很好抓紧这项工作，采取各种有效措施，把它做好，保障群众生活和各项建设事业继续跃进。
