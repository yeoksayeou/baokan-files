Bulgaria Massively Rears Pigs, Sheep, Chickens, and Ducks
	National Average Exceeds One Sheep Per Person Chicken and Duck Population Increases by Eight Million in Eleven Months
	Since Bulgaria launched its economic leap forward movement at the end of last year, the livestock and poultry breeding industry, which occupies an important position in Bulgarian agriculture, has achieved great development.
	This year, Bulgaria has increased its sheep population by more than one million compared to last year. The country now has more than nine million sheep, meaning that the national average exceeds one sheep per person.
	The growth rate of pigs is also very rapid. In less than two years from the beginning of 1958 to the present, the number of pigs raised nationwide is 400,000 more than the number raised in the five years from 1952 to 1957.
	The increase in the number of chickens and ducks is even more astonishing. During the period from 1952 to 1957, the total number of chickens and ducks in the country only increased by about two million, while in nearly eleven months this year, it has already increased by at least eight million.
	With the increase in the number of livestock and poultry, the output of livestock and poultry products is also constantly increasing.
	Over the past year, members of Bulgarian agricultural production cooperatives, inspired by the slogan of "completing the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule," have tried every means to promote the development of livestock and poultry breeding. They have improved breeding methods, actively stored feed, expanded the planting area of feed crops, and improved the management of pastures and poultry farms. By about mid-November, the agricultural production cooperatives and state farms nationwide had accumulated a total of 6,462,000 tons of silage, an increase of about 100% compared with the same period last year. The country produced nearly twice as much auxiliary feed this year as last year. The planting area of corn for feed has increased more than four times compared to last year, reaching 7.5 million decares. This year, the country's capacity for hatching chicks has increased by about 150% compared to last year, and it can hatch 11 million chicks at a time.

　　保加利亚大养猪羊鸡鸭
    全国每人平均有羊一只以上  十一个月增加鸡鸭八百万只
    自从去年年底保加利亚开展经济跃进运动以来，在保加利亚农业中占重要地位的牲畜和家禽饲养业已经取得了巨大的发展。
    保加利亚今年比去年增长了一百多万只羊，现在全国共有九百多万只羊，也就是说，全国每人平均有羊一只以上。
    猪的增长速度也很迅速。从1958年初到现在不到两年的时间内，全国养猪的头数比1952到1957年五年期间养的还多四十万头。
    鸡鸭数目的增长更为惊人。从1952年到1957年期间，全国大鸡鸭总共才只增加了二百万只左右，而在今年近十一个月中就已经增加了最少八百万只。
    随着牲畜和家禽数量的增加，畜产品和家禽产品的产量也不断增长。
    一年来，保加利亚农业生产合作社的社员在“缩短期限完成第三个五年计划”的口号鼓舞下，千方百计地促进牲畜和家禽饲养业的发展。他们改进饲养方法，积极储存饲料，扩大饲料作物种植面积，改进牧场和禽场管理。到11月中旬左右，全国农业生产合作社和国营农场已经积存的青储饲料共达六百四十六万二千吨，比去年同期增加了约一倍。今年全国生产的辅助饲料比去年增加了近一倍。作饲料用的玉米播种面积比去年增加了四倍多，达七百五十万狄卡尔。今年来，全国孵小鸡的机器设备能力，比去年增加了约一倍半，一次就能孵出小鸡一千一百万只。
