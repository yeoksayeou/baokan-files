    (Our report) To invigorate intra-party democratic life and fully exert the fighting bastion role of Party branches, the Party branch of the Zhouliu Management District of the Gujiao People's Commune in Houma City, Shanxi Province, has improved its Party member congress system since last year. The Party member congress of this branch is now generally convened once a month, and it ensures adequate preparation before meetings, a clear agenda and prominent focus during meetings, and can fully promote democracy to carry out criticism and self-criticism.

    Whether a Party member congress can be successfully held depends first and foremost on adequate preparation before the meeting. The Zhouliu Party branch was previously unclear on this point. For example, in one Party member congress, the central topic was dealing with the issue of Wei Yinlong, the former deputy secretary of the branch, being exploited by rich peasant elements. Because there was no preparation before the meeting, the person in charge of the branch simply talked about the situation and then asked everyone to expose and criticize. As a result, only a few people spoke. After the meeting, some people said: "The matter is obvious, but the branch committee members are unwilling to push it, so what are we supposed to say!" The branch accepted this opinion and, in response to the reasons why this congress was not successful, made the necessary preparations. When the second Party member congress was convened, it first organized everyone to study relevant documents, further enhancing the political awareness of the Party members. On this basis, Wei Yinlong was asked to make an account to everyone. However, in his account, he flatly denied having any relationship with rich peasant elements. In order to thoroughly clarify the matter and carry out ideological struggle by presenting facts and reasoning, all Party members conducted a meticulous investigation and research among the masses. Therefore, at the third Party member congress, twenty-four Party members spoke, and all cited witnesses and material evidence to show that Wei Yinlong was indeed exploited by rich peasant elements and had lost his class position. Thus, Wei Yinlong had no choice but to admit his mistakes.

    From the above incident, the Party branch summarized three points of experience: First, before the meeting, the branch should organize Party members to study the Party's relevant policies and instructions around the central issue to be resolved. This can enable everyone to fully promote democracy on the basis of enhancing understanding, which is conducive to solving the problem. Second, after the branch determines the agenda of the congress, it should first widely solicit the opinions of Party members and commune members, and fully discuss them in the branch committee, discover problems, and earnestly do a good job in investigation and research. Third, the content of the congress must be notified to all Party members before the meeting, and they should be asked to make ideological preparations and actively express their opinions when the time comes.

    The Zhouliu Management District Party branch has varying degrees of debate on the central topic of each Party member congress. Because on this point, they also have profound lessons from the past. In the past, at one Party member congress, they often raised seven or eight tasks, such as fertilizer accumulation, hygiene, wheat field management, and current affairs propaganda, for everyone to discuss. This wasted a lot of time, and Party members had no way to start. As a result, after talking for a long time, the problem was not solved, and they had to announce the adjournment. This proves that the agenda must be clear, the center must be prominent, and it is essential to grasp the most important issues of the current work. Now, they never easily propose the agenda of the Party member congress, and they always confirm it after repeated research. For example, in March of this year, the commune Party committee arranged tasks such as wheat frost prevention, large-scale fertilizer accumulation, wheat spring irrigation, and cotton autumn field replanting. Which task should be the focus? Initially, the opinions of the branch committee members were also inconsistent. Some advocated focusing on fertilizer accumulation, some advocated focusing on wheat frost prevention, and some also advocated focusing on cotton autumn field replanting. The leading comrades of the branch did not rush to draw a conclusion, but successively exchanged opinions with production team leaders and Party members. Most people believed that fertilizer was the most lacking, and fertilizer accumulation should be ranked first. Then the branch made a calculation: According to the plan, the entire management district needed more than 17 million catties of fertilizer, but only had more than 8.2 million catties. If no measures were taken, the remaining fertilizer would take half a year to accumulate, which would greatly affect production. Only then did the branch committee members' understanding become consistent, and they explained it to the Party member congress, inspiring everyone to find fertilizer sources and arrange overall work around this central topic. Five fertilizer sources were quickly found at the meeting, and professional teams were organized. The fertilizer accumulation task was overfulfilled in twelve days, and other work was also carried out normally without being affected.

    One of the characteristics of the Zhouliu Management District Party member congress is to fully promote democracy and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Every Party member has a strong sense of responsibility for the congress and actively puts forward opinions, so that everyone is happy. The branch committee members not only carefully listen to approving opinions, but also humbly listen to opposing opinions. At the Party member congress in April of this year, when discussing the issue of dividing four production teams into eight teams, most people agreed with this opinion, and only six people opposed it. At this time, someone proposed a vote, but the branch believed that everyone had not yet stated their reasons, and it was necessary to continue the debate. Only then did those who raised opposing opinions state that dividing immediately would affect production during the cotton planting and wheat field processing season; the land in each team had already been planned, and it was also inconvenient to divide; each team only included about eighty households, and the labor force was just right for allocation. After saying this, everyone gradually felt that it was better not to divide, and made the decision not to divide. The Party member congress also often encounters situations like this: after repeated debates on an issue, a few people still disagree with the opinions of the majority, and the congress has to make a decision in accordance with the principle of the minority obeying the majority.

    The Zhouliu Management District Party branch can not only successfully hold Party member congresses, fully promote democracy, and make resolutions on current important work, but also take all measures to resolutely ensure the complete realization of the resolutions. Their measures mainly include four items: First, according to the ability and expertise of each Party member, implement division of labor and battle lines in production, and implement division of areas and responsibility to individuals in ideological work, so that all resolutions can be implemented. Second, give play to the role of Party groups, and check and supervise Party members to earnestly implement resolutions through organizational life meetings. Third, the branch committee regularly conducts inspections and helps solve specific problems. Fourth, strengthen the activities of Party members in various mass organizations and commune members, and turn the implementation of the resolutions of the Party member congress into the tasks of various mass organizations and the broad masses of commune members.

### 会前充分准备  会上议题明确  充分发扬民主  周流管理区党员大会开得好

    会前充分准备  会上议题明确  充分发扬民主
    周流管理区党员大会开得好
    本报讯　为了活跃党内民主生活，充分发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用，山西省侯马市古交人民公社周流管理区党支部，从去年以来，健全了党员大会制度。这个支部的党员大会，目前一般每月都能召开一次，而且作到了会前充分准备，会上议题明确，中心突出，并能充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评。
    党员大会是否能够开得好，先决条件之一在于会前的准备工作。这一点，周流党支部过去不够明确。比如在一次党员大会上，中心议题是处理前支部副书记卫引龙被富农分子利用问题。由于会前没有任何准备，会上支部负责人简单谈了一下情况，就让大家进行揭发批判。结果，只有几个人发言。会后，有人说：“事情是明摆着的，支委们还挖不破面皮，叫我们该说些啥呀！”支部接受了这一意见，针对这次大会没有开好的原因，进行了必要的准备工作。到第二次召开党员大会时，首先组织大家学习了有关文件，进一步提高了党员的政治觉悟。在此基础上，让卫引龙向大家作了交代。但他在交代中，一口否认与富农分子有关系。为了把问题彻底澄清，进行摆事实和讲道理的思想斗争，全体党员又深入群众作了细致的调查研究工作。因此，在第三次党员大会上，便有二十四个党员发言，而且都举出人证物证，说明卫引龙确实被富农分子利用，丧失阶级立场。这样，卫引龙才不得不低头认错。
    从上述这件事情中，党支部总结了三点经验：一、在会前，支部应当围绕要解决的中心问题，组织党员学习党的有关政策和指示。这样可以使大家在提高认识的基础上，充分发扬民主，有利于问题的解决。二、支部在确定了大会的议题以后，应当首先广泛征求党员和社员的意见，并在支委会上进行充分讨论，发现问题并认真做好调查研究工作。三、会前一定要将大会的内容通知全体党员，要他们做好思想准备，到时积极发表意见。
    对每次党员大会的中心议题，周流管理区党支部都有程度不同的争论。因为在这一点上，他们过去同样有着深刻的经验教训。过去，他们在一次党员大会上，常常把积肥、卫生、麦田管理、时事宣传等七八项任务提出来让大家讨论。这样时间浪费得很长，党员也无从下口。结果，说上半天，不解决问题，只好宣布散会。这就证明：议题必须明确，中心必须突出，而且一定要抓当前工作中最主要的问题。现在，他们对于党员大会的议题，决不轻易提出，总是要经过反复研究才肯定下来。如今年3月间，公社党委布置了小麦防冻、大搞积肥、小麦春浇、棉秋田补种等任务，究竟以哪项任务为中心呢？最初支委们的意见也不一致，有的主张以积肥为中心，有的主张以小麦防冻为中心，有的还主张以棉秋田补种为中心。支部的领导同志没有急于下结论，而是先后和生产队长、党员交换了意见，多数人认为肥料缺得最多，应当把抓肥排到第一位。接着支部又算了一笔账：按照计划，全管理区需要肥料一千七百余万斤，现有的只八百二十余万斤。若不采取措施，尚缺的肥料需要半年时间才能积够，那就会大大影响生产。这样支委们的认识才一致起来，并向党员大会作了说明，启发大家围绕这个中心议题，寻找肥源，安排全盘工作。会上很快找到了五种肥源，组织了专业队伍。积肥任务十二天便超额完成，其它工作也正常进行，没有受到影响。
    周流管理区党员大会的特点之一，是充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评。每个党员对大会都抱有坚强的责任感，积极提出意见，做到人人心情舒畅。支委们不仅细心地听取赞同的意见，而且也虚心地听取反对的意见。今年4月的党员大会在讨论把四个生产队分为八个队的问题时，大多数人同意这一意见，只有六人反对。这时有人提议进行表决，但支部认为大家还没有把各自的理由申述出来，需要继续辩论下去。这样提反对意见的人才申述道：正在种棉和麦田加工时期，马上分开会影响生产；各队土地已经规划，也不便分开；每队仅包括八十户左右，劳力正好调配。经这么一说，大家逐渐感到还是不分为好，才做出了不分的决定。党员大会上也经常遇到这样的情况：一个问题经过再三辩论，仍有少数人不同意多数人的意见，大会只好按照少数服从多数的原则作出决议。
    周流管理区党支部，不仅能够开好党员大会，充分发扬民主，对当前重要工作做出决议，而且还能采取一切措施，坚决保证决议的完满实现。他们的措施主要有四项：一，根据每个党员的能力和特长，在生产上实行分工分战线，在思想工作上实行分片包干、责任到人，使各项决议都能落实。二，发挥党小组的作用，通过组织生活会，检查督促党员认真执行决议。三，支委定期进行检查，并帮助解决具体问题。四，加强党员在各个群众团体和社员中的活动，把执行党员大会的决议，变成各个群众团体和广大社员的任务。
