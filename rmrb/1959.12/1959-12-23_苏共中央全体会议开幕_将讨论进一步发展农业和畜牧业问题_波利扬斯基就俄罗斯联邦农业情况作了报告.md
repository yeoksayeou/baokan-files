Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 22nd - TASS reports: The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opened today in the Grand Kremlin Palace. The meeting was presided over by Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

This Central Committee Plenary Session will summarize the implementation of the agricultural plan for the first year of the Seven-Year Plan and discuss the urgent tasks of further developing agriculture and animal husbandry in the Soviet Union.

Representatives from seven republics, including the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Azerbaijan, will report on the further development of agriculture.

The Central Committee will discuss measures to implement the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the December 1958 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee on increasing agricultural production and increasing the production of grain, sugar beets, cotton, and other agricultural products based on these reports.

The plenary session will also discuss the development of public animal husbandry and increasing livestock products, strengthening agricultural cadres, further mechanization of agricultural production, strengthening the collective farm public economy, and improving the material welfare of collective farmers.

Leading agricultural producers, representatives of industrial sectors, and scientists were invited to attend the plenary session.

Poliansky, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, reported on the agricultural situation in the Russian Federation at today's meeting.

Poliansky said that the major measures implemented in the country in recent years have led collective farms and state farms onto a path of rapid upswing.

Poliansky pointed out the tremendous achievements made by agriculture in the Russian Federation this year. He said that although the climatic conditions this year were not good, the grain sold to the state by the agricultural sector was higher than the average of the past five years. The total grain harvest of the entire Federation this year reached 4.2 billion poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin), which is 1.36 billion poods more than the average annual output in the five years before the reclamation of virgin land.

Poliansky said that in order to further increase grain production, preparations are underway to reclaim millions of hectares of wasteland in the Urals, the Volga River Basin, Siberia, and the Far East to expand the grain sown area and increase grain harvests by 500 to 600 million poods.

In the Northwest and the Central Non-Black Soil Zone, work will be carried out to reclaim cultivated fallow land, swamps, and flooded land. Important agricultural measures will be taken to increase grain yield per unit area.

When talking about the development of animal husbandry, Poliansky said that in the first eleven months of this year, meat production in the Russian Federation increased by more than one-third compared to last year, and milk production increased by 13%.

The state has purchased 4.3 million tons of meat, an increase of 1.244 million tons compared to last year. Poliansky particularly pointed out the achievements of agricultural workers in the Ryazan Region, who sold twice as much meat to the state this year as in 1958.

Poliansky said that the collective farms and state farms of the Russian Federation have been greatly strengthened, and most of them are now large and wealthy economic units. One of the signs of this is the unprecedented scale of construction of housing and cultural and living facilities in rural areas. Poliansky also pointed out that the collective farms and state farms of the Russian Federation received another 73,000 tractors, 33,000 combine harvesters, and many other machines this year.

    波利扬斯基就俄罗斯联邦农业情况作了报告
    新华社莫斯科22日电　据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议今天在大克里姆林宫开幕。会议由苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫主持。
    这次中央全会将总结七年计划头一年农业计划的执行情况，并讨论苏联进一步发展农业和畜牧业的迫切任务。
    俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、哈萨克、白俄罗斯、乌兹别克、塔吉克、阿塞拜疆等七个共和国的代表将就进一步发展农业的问题作报告。
    中央全会将根据这些报告来讨论关于执行苏共第二十一次代表大会和苏共中央1958年12月全体会议关于提高农业和增加谷物、甜菜、棉花和其他农产品生产的决议的措施。
    全会还将讨论发展公有畜牧业和增加畜产品的问题，加强农业干部问题，农业生产进一步机械化问题，加强集体农庄公有经济和提高集体农民物质福利的问题。
    应邀参加全体会议的有：农业先进生产者、工业部门的代表和科学界人士。
    俄罗斯联邦部长会议主席波利扬斯基在今天的会议上就俄罗斯联邦的农业情况作了报告。
    波利扬斯基说，最近几年来在国内所实行的重大措施把集体农庄和国营农场引上了急剧高涨的道路。
    波利扬斯基指出了今年俄罗斯联邦的农业所获得的巨大成就。他说，虽然今年的气候条件不好，但是农业部门交售给国家的粮食却高于最近五年的平均水平。今年全联邦的谷物总收获量达四十二亿普特（一普特等于三十二点七六市斤），这个数字比开垦生荒地以前的五年的平均年产量多十三亿六千万普特。
    波利扬斯基说，为了进一步增加谷物生产，准备在乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域、西伯利亚和远东开垦几百万公顷荒地，以扩大谷物播种面积，增收五亿到六亿普特的粮食。
    在西北地区和中央非黑土地带要开展开垦熟荒地、沼泽地和水淹地的工作。准备采取一些重要的农业措施来增加谷物单位面积产量。
    波利扬斯基在谈到畜牧业的发展情况时说，在今年的头十一个月中，俄罗斯联邦的肉类生产比去年增加了三分之一以上，奶类生产增长了13％。
    国家已收购到的肉类达四百三十万吨，比去年增多了一百二十四万四千吨。波利扬斯基特别指出了梁赞州农业劳动者的成绩，他们今年交售给国家的肉类比1958年多两倍。
    波利扬斯基说，俄罗斯联邦的集体农庄和国营农场已经大大加强了，现在，它们当中的大多数都是大型的、富裕的经济单位。这一点的标志之一便是，农村建设生产房舍和文化生活建筑物的规模空前庞大。波利扬斯基还指出，俄罗斯联邦集体农庄和国营农场今年又得到了七万三千台拖拉机、三万三千台联合收割机和其他许多机器。
