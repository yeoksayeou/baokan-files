Xinhua News Agency, December 28th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," today published an editorial titled "The Current Political Situation and the Direction of Development," pointing out that this year's political situation in Japan has developed with the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the issue of complete disarmament as its center.

The editorial pointed out that the petitions submitted by the Japanese people to the Diet on November 27th and the struggles launched throughout the country prove that the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" and their demands for complete disarmament are rising higher and higher. Although the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, the Liberal Democratic Party, and Japanese monopoly capital disregard the growing strength of the people and launch vicious attacks against them, this simultaneously promotes the gradual maturation of conditions for the people to organize even stronger counterattacks.

The editorial pointed out that the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" can continue to develop into a movement for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality in the future.

"Akahata" called on Japanese Communist Party members to go deep among the people and strengthen propaganda and organizational activities everywhere until the struggle to prevent revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty" achieves victory.

"Akahata" also called on the Japanese people to not only successfully implement the planned activities against the "Security Treaty" on the day Kishi Nobusuke leaves Japan for the United States to sign the new "Security Treaty," but also to take various forms of protest, such as factories and trains sounding their whistles together, holding various gatherings, and stores flying flags at half-mast to protest the revision of the "Security Treaty" by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

Xinhua News Agency, December 28th, Tokyo dispatch: The Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party held a meeting today and decided to resolutely oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to persecute Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma and other Diet members.

The meeting pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to have the Diet punish Asanuma and other Socialist Party members is a unilateral and unreasonable act, and the Socialist Party must investigate the responsibility and fight this behavior to the end with the unity of the entire party.

The meeting also decided to hold a Central Executive Committee meeting on January 26th and 27th next year to discuss countermeasures for the ordinary session of the Diet and other issues; an extraordinary Socialist Party convention will be held in mid-March to discuss the issue of preventing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, December 27th, Tokyo dispatch: The 33rd extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet, which began on October 26th, closed today.

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan used its majority seats in this extraordinary session of the Diet to force the passage of the agreement granting war reparations to South Vietnam in both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors.

In order to suppress the increasingly high tide of mass movements to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Liberal Democratic Party, in the absence of opposition party members from the plenary session of the House of Representatives, unilaterally passed a reactionary law prohibiting the Japanese people from holding demonstrations around the Diet. However, due to strong opposition from Japanese public opinion and the refusal of opposition party members to attend the plenary session of the House of Councillors, the House of Councillors was forced to decide to postpone the deliberation of this reactionary law and hand it over to the next ordinary session of the Diet for handling.

　　日共“赤旗报”号召党员深入人民
    阻止修改和废除“安全条约”
    社会党反对岸信介政府迫害社会党议员
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表题为“现在的政局和发展的方向”的社论指出，今年日本的政局是以修改日美“安全条约”和完全裁军问题为中心而发展的。
    社论指出，11月27日日本人民向国会的请愿和全国各地展开的斗争证明，日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争和关于完全裁军的要求越来越高涨。虽然岸信介内阁和自由民主党以及日本垄断资本轻视正在日益成长的人民的力量，对人民发动凶恶的攻击，但是这同时将促使人民组织更有力量的反击的条件逐渐成熟。
    社论指出，反对修改“安全条约”的斗争今后能够成为争取独立、民主、和平、中立的运动而继续发展。
    “赤旗报”号召日本共产党党员深入人民，在各处加强宣传和组织活动，直到阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”的斗争取得胜利为止。
    “赤旗报”还号召日本人民在岸信介为签署新“安全条约”离开日本到美国的那一天，不仅要胜利地实行原定反对“安全条约”活动的计划，而且要采取工厂和火车齐鸣汽笛、举行各种集会、商店升半旗等各种形式表示抗议美日反动派修改“安全条约”。
    据新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会今天举行会议，决定坚决反对岸信介政府迫害社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎等议员的阴谋。
    会议指出，岸信介政府阴谋使国会惩罚浅沼等社会党议员的活动是单方面的、不合理的行为，社会党要追究责任，全党一致地同这种行为斗争到底。
    会议并且决定明年1月26、27两日举行中央执行委员会会议，讨论国会平时会议的对策等问题；3月中旬将召开社会党临时代表大会，讨论阻止修改日美“安全条约”问题。
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：10月26日开始的日本国会第三十三次临时会议已经在今天闭幕。
    日本执政党自由民主党在这次国会临时会议上利用它的多数议席强使参众两院通过了给予南越以战争赔偿的协定。
    自由民主党为了镇压日益高涨的阻止修改日美“安全条约”的群众运动，在反对党议员拒绝出席众议院全体会议的情况下，单独通过了禁止日本人民在国会周围举行示威游行的反动法律。但是，在日本舆论的强烈反对和反对党议员拒绝出席参议院全体会议的情况下，参议院被迫决定推迟审议这项反动法律，把它移交下届国会平时会议处理。
