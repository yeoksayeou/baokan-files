Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 26th - The Nianbo People's Commune in Ledu County, Qinghai, fully utilizes the superiority of the commune, extensively carries out communist-style large-scale cooperation, and overcomes major hailstorms. This year, both industrial and agricultural production have achieved unprecedented leaps forward. The total output and average yield per unit area of more than 50,000 mu of grain crops in the entire commune have increased by more than 15% compared to the bumper year of 1958. More than 6,000 mu of high-yielding fields with yields of over 500 jin per mu have emerged, and more than half of the production teams have already exceeded the production targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The commune's industry and other economic developments have also been rapid. This year, the commune's industrial income accounts for 28.3% of the total industrial and agricultural income, and the output value is more than seven times that of 1958; the income from cash crops has also increased by 70% compared to last year.

The Nianbo Commune is located in the suburbs of Ledu County, surrounded by mountains and rivers, and is a good place for forestry, farming, and animal husbandry. However, in the past, due to the cruel exploitation of the reactionary ruling class, the people's lives were extremely difficult before liberation, and the level of production was not high. After liberation, especially after agricultural cooperativization, the production in this area has greatly developed. However, at that time, the following difficulties were still encountered in further developing production: First, there was a shortage of labor, and the distribution was uneven. In mountainous areas, each laborer had to bear more than ten mu of land on average, while in the plains, each laborer only had to bear three or four mu. Therefore, it was not possible to make the best use of people's talents, fully utilize the role of labor, and complete agricultural work on time and with quality. Another problem was that the mountainous areas lacked water, and the plains were harmed by mountain floods. Hailstorms often occurred before and after the harvest, so crops were often threatened by drought, floods, and hailstorms, and the yield was not guaranteed. After communization, labor was arranged in a unified manner, labor was adjusted between production teams, public canteens were established, and women's labor was liberated. In particular, since 1958, the commune has extensively organized large-scale labor cooperation through vigorous mass movements. In this way, the labor force of the entire commune has increased by nearly half, the labor attendance rate has reached 98%, and labor efficiency has increased by about one time.

Large-scale labor cooperation has played a very significant role in production. For example, this summer, just when the wheat crops in the plains were being harvested and the vegetable and other cash crops were growing vigorously, they encountered a hailstorm that had not been seen for decades, and were hit by seven hailstorms in a month. During this period, the ripe crops had to be harvested quickly, and the damaged vegetables had to be replanted, so the task was very urgent. In the face of this difficulty, the commune immediately mobilized the entire commune's strength to support the disaster area, and harvested more than 20,000 mu of mature crops, and swept back more than 145,000 jin of grain that had been knocked down on 5,000 mu of land. In the past year, the entire commune has also built 52 canals and 3 small reservoirs through large-scale cooperation, built many flood control dams, and planted more than 42,300 mu of greenery trees. In addition to the original soil and water conservation projects, it has controlled soil erosion area of more than 70 square kilometers, basically controlling the harm of mountain floods.

This year, the Nianbo Commune also adjusted the planting layout of various crops within the entire commune through unified planning, so that the land was used to its full potential. In addition to fully and rationally utilizing the existing cultivated land, this year the commune also uniformly allocated manpower to reclaim more than 13,000 mu of wasteland, more than three times the total wasteland reclaimed in the nine years after liberation.

The industry run by the commune has also developed greatly. From last year to now, the entire commune has established a total of 48 factories for agricultural implements, iron and woodworking, sand casting, power generation, bricks and tiles, and non-staple food processing, with more than 100 production items and hundreds of products. The rapid development of commune-run industry has strongly supported agricultural production. In the past year, the commune's local fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer plants have produced more than 150 million jin of bacterial fertilizer, local fertilizer, and mixed fertilizer; the commune's agricultural implement repair and assembly plant and the iron and wood factories of various teams have newly manufactured and repaired more than 38,000 pieces of large and small agricultural implements, 350 animal-powered vehicles, and also built a large number of handcarts, basically meeting the needs of agricultural production and ensuring that nearly one billion jin of fertilizer in the entire commune was transported to the fields in a timely manner. At the same time, the commune has established factories for processing agricultural and animal husbandry products, non-staple food processing, and building materials in accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, which has also played a great role in meeting the daily needs of commune members and serving national construction and the market.

Unified planning and managing agriculture according to local conditions have promoted the development of diverse economies centered on grain production. Among the total income, grain crops account for 35.42%, and diverse economies account for 64.58% (industry accounts for 28.3%; cash crops account for 22.29%; animal husbandry accounts for 6.6%; sideline occupations account for 6.27%; forestry accounts for 1.1%). This fact shows that the people's commune has transformed the single economy into a stable and growing comprehensive economy, and the production of commodities has been rapidly expanded.

With the rapid development of production, the commune has become more prosperous. This year, the total income of the entire commune has increased by 60% compared to 1958, and more than 230% compared to 1957. The strength of the collective economy has been enhanced. This year, the public accumulation of the entire commune accounts for 15.27% of the total income (excluding commune-run industry), more than five times that of 1958. The income of commune members has also increased. More than 90% of the commune members have increased their income. Significant changes have taken place in the lives of commune members. Now, savings accounts in the entire commune account for 92% of the total number of households, equal to 130% of the amount of savings at the end of 1958. The purchasing power of commune members has increased by 38.2% compared to the same period in 1958.

The collective welfare undertakings of the commune have developed extremely rapidly. Now, 64 public canteens have been established, some permanent, some temporary, some run by water conservancy construction sites, and some run by land reclamation expeditions; every team has nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and health stations; the commune has ordinary middle schools and agricultural technical middle schools, and there are 33 primary schools, with all more than 3,500 school-age children in the commune enrolled in school. Every production team has a civil school, reading room and club, every team has telephone access, and every village has installed loudspeakers.

　　一大二公　灾害低头
    碾伯公社粮食产量提高15％　工业产值增长六倍
    据新华社西宁26日电　青海乐都县碾伯人民公社充分发挥公社优越性，广泛开展共产主义大协作，战胜大雹灾，今年工农业生产都获得了前所未有的跃进。全公社五万多亩粮食作物，今年总产量和平均单位面积产量都比丰收的1958年增产15％以上，出现了亩产五百斤以上的大面积丰产田六千多亩，有一半以上的生产队已经提前超过全国农业发展纲要规定的生产指标。公社工业和其它各种经济发展也很迅速。今年公社工业的收入占到工农业总收入的28.3％，产值等于1958年的七倍多；经济作物的收入也比去年增长70％。
    碾伯公社在乐都县城郊，依山傍水，是宜林、宜耕、宜牧的好地方。但过去由于反动统治阶级的残酷剥削，解放前人民生活极为困苦，生产水平不高。解放以后，特别是农业合作化以后，这个地区的生产有了很大发展。但是，当时在进一步发展生产上仍然遇到以下几个困难：一是劳动力不足，分布又不平衡，山区每个劳动力平均负担十多亩土地，平川里每个劳动力只负担三、四亩，因而不能做到人尽其才，充分发挥劳动力的作用，按时、按质量地完成农活。另一个是山区缺乏水，川地山洪为害，收割前后经常落冰雹，因而庄稼常受干旱、洪水和雹灾的威胁，产量没有保证。公社化后，统一安排了劳动力，各生产队之间的劳动力作了调整，举办了公共食堂，妇女劳动力得到了解放；特别是1958年以来，公社通过大搞群众运动，广泛组织了劳力大协作。这样，全社劳动力增加了将近一半，劳动出勤率达到98％，劳动效率提高了约一倍。
    劳力大协作在生产中起了十分显著的作用。例如今年夏天，正当川地麦类作物开镰收割，蔬菜等经济作物生长旺盛的时候，遇到了数十年来未有的雹灾，一个月连遭七次冰雹猛袭。在这期间，庄稼已熟的要抢收，蔬菜打了的要补种，任务十分紧迫。在这种困难面前，公社立即动员全社的力量，支援灾区，抢收了成熟的庄稼二万多亩，并在五千亩地上扫回被打落的粮食十四万五千多斤。一年来，全社还通过大协作修建了五十二条水渠和三座小水库，修了许多防洪坝，绿化植树四万二千三百多亩，加上原来水土保持工程，已控制水土流失面积七十多平方公里，基本上控制了山洪为害。
    碾伯公社今年还通过统一规划，在全社范围内对各种作物的种植布局作了调整，做到了地尽其利。除了充分合理地利用现有耕地以外，今年公社还统一调配人力开垦了一万三千多亩荒地，比解放后九年来开荒的总和还多三倍多。
    社办工业也有很大发展。从去年到现在，全公社共建立了四十八个农具、铁工木工、翻砂、发电、砖瓦和副食品加工等工厂，生产项目有一百多项，产品达数百种。社办工业的迅速发展，有力地支援了农业生产。一年来，全社土化肥和细菌肥料厂，已经生产了细菌肥料、土化肥和混合肥料一亿五千多万斤；公社的农具修配厂和各队的铁木工厂，新制和修配了大小农具三万八千多件，畜力车三百五十辆，还修造了大量的手推车，基本上满足了农业生产的需要，保证了全社近十亿斤肥料及时运到地里。同时公社本着因地制宜、就地取材的原则，兴办了农牧产品加工、副食品加工和建筑材料等工厂，对于满足社员日常生活的需要和为国家建设与市场服务，也起了很大作用。
    统一计划和因地制宜的经营农业，促进了以粮食生产为中心的多种经济的发展。在总收入中粮食作物占35.42％，多种经济占64.58％（工业占28.3％；经济作物占22.29％；牧业占6.6％；副业占6.27％；林业占1.1％）。这一事实说明：人民公社已使单一的经济向稳定增长的综合经济发展，使商品性生产得到了迅速的扩大。
    随着生产的迅速发展，公社更加富裕了。今年全社总收入比1958年增加60％，比1957年增加230％还多。集体经济力量增强了。全社今年公共积累占总收入（不包括社办工业）的15.27％，比1958年增加五倍多。社员的收入也增多起来。全社90％以上的社员都增加了收入。社员的生活发生了显著变化。现在全社存款户已经占到总户数的92％，等于1958年年底时存款额的130％。社员的购买力比1958年同期增长了38.2％。
    公社集体福利事业发展极快。现在已经办了六十四个公共食堂，有常年的，有临时的，有水利工地办的，也有开荒远征队办的；队队有托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院和保健站；公社有了普通中学和农业技术中学，有三十三所小学，全社三千五百多适龄儿童全部入学，各生产队都有民校、阅览室和俱乐部，队队通了电话，村村安上了广播喇叭。
