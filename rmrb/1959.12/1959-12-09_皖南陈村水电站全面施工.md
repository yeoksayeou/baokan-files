The Chencun Hydropower Station project in Jing County, southern Anhui, has entered a stage of intense and comprehensive construction. The dam that cuts across the Qingyi River was successfully closed on November 10th. Currently, foundation clearing is underway, and large-scale concrete pouring is about to begin.

The Chencun Hydropower Station dam is 105 meters high and has an arc length of 195 meters. It can store 7.5 billion cubic meters of water, with an installed capacity of 290,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of 589 million kilowatt-hours, which is more than the total of the Foziling, Meishan, Xianghongdian, and Mozitan reservoirs combined. After all four units of the Chencun Hydropower Station are generating electricity, it will solve the peak load of electricity in Anhui Province.

After the hydropower station dam is built, the artificial lake upstream will have an area of more than 200 square kilometers, and large ships can reach the foot of Mount Huangshan directly. The flood flow of 2,800 square kilometers upstream of the reservoir will be completely intercepted, eliminating flood and drought disasters for more than 2 million mu of farmland downstream and providing irrigation, completely changing the mountainous area's situation of "floods in heavy rain and drought without rain." After the hydropower station is built, navigation will be possible upstream all year round, and the downstream flow will be maintained at 80 cubic meters per second, which can further develop the shipping and aquatic industry of the Qingyi River.

    皖南陈村水电站全面施工
    本报讯　皖南泾县陈村水电站工程，已经进入紧张的全面大施工阶段。腰斩青弋江的大围坝已在11月10日胜利合龙，现在，正在进行清基，即将大量浇筑混凝土。
    陈村水电站坝高一百零五米，坝身弧长一百九十五米，能够蓄水七十五亿立方米，装机容量二十九万瓩，年发电量为五亿八万九千度，比佛子岭、梅山、响洪甸、磨子潭四个水库的总和还多。陈村水电站四台机组全部发电后，将解决安徽全省电力的高峰负荷。
    水电站大坝筑成后，上游的人工湖面积为二百多平方公里，大型轮船可直抵黄山脚下；水库上游二千八百平方公里面积的洪水流量，将全部拦蓄起来，使下游二百多万亩农田根除洪、涝灾害并可灌溉，彻底改变山区“大雨洪灾，不雨旱灾”的状况。水电站建成后，上游常年通航，下游经常保持八十秒公方的流量，可以进一步发展青弋江的航运和水产事业。（附图片）
