　　Borrowing the East Wind
　　Yan Yizhong, Worker at Shijingshan Power Plant
    In this year's Great Leap Forward, "borrowing the wind" has become a magic weapon for everyone to promote work.
    To complete an arduous task, borrow the wind. When encountering difficulties in work, borrow the wind. When the wind arrives, dark clouds scatter and the sun emerges, a scene of ten thousand horses galloping.
    Here's an example from our factory: This year, we overhauled Furnace No. 14, originally planned for fifteen days. Due to the tight power supply, we were required to complete the task in twelve days. When put to the team for discussion, the result was that the task could be completed in thirteen days. What to do? This was still not enough to satisfy the higher authorities.
    Therefore, the Party committee invited Comrade Si Yuncheng, the Yellow River control representative who participated in the conference of heroes, to share his personal experiences. He spoke at length about how the exploration team of the Yellow River Harnessing Committee endured rain and dew in the barren mountains and dense forests, ate wild food, and fought against nature, finally overcoming numerous difficulties and following the path of the Red Army's Long March, completing the task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota.
    After listening, the comrades reduced the plan to ten days, and the task was completed in eight days. This is an unprecedented new record. Of course, there were many factors involved. However, a very important one was that the Party provided the East Wind, overcame right-leaning thoughts, and as a result, greatly exceeded the task quota.
    Therefore, borrowing the wind is extremely important. We must borrow more and borrow big. But, we must borrow well.
    What does "well" mean? It means borrowing the East Wind, borrowing the wind of the Great Leap Forward, borrowing the wind of the communist style, borrowing the wind of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and borrowing the wind of going all out and aiming high.
    Now, the Great Leap Forward year of 1959 is coming to an end, and a new year of leaping forward is coming. On the road of continuously advancing to build socialism, we will resolutely raise the banner of Marxism-Leninism, attract the East Wind, borrow the East Wind of Marxism-Leninism and the General Line, and ignite the Samadhi True Fire to burn away all the monsters and demons on our path forward.

　　借东风
　　石景山发电厂工人　阎一忠
    在今年的大跃进当中，“借风”已经成为大家推动工作的法宝了。
    为了完成一个艰巨的任务，借风。工作中遇到困难，借风。风到，则乌云散太阳出，一片万马奔腾的景象。
    举我厂一个实例：今年大修十四号炉，原计划是十五天。因为电源紧张，要求十二天完成任务。放到班组讨论，结果认为十三天可以完成任务。怎办？还不够上游。
    于是，党委就请来参加群英会的治黄代表司云程同志，现身说法，大讲他们根治黄河委员会的勘探队员，在荒山密林中，宿雨地，食野味，历尽风霜，与大自然搏斗，终于克服重重困难，踏着红军二万五千里长征经过的道路，提前超额完成了任务。
    同志们听后，计划缩到十天，结果八天就完成了任务。这是破天荒的新记录。当然，其中有很多因素。不过，很主要的一条，就是党给借来东风，克服了右倾思想，结果大大超额完成任务。
    因此，借风极为重要。要多借、大借。但，要借得好。
    何谓好？就是要借东风，借大跃进的风，借共产主义风格的风，借八中全会精神的风，借鼓足干劲力争上游的风。
    现在，大跃进的1959年就要过去，新的跃进的一年就要来了。在不断前进的建设社会主义的大道上，我们坚决举起马列主义旗帜，招引东风，借马列主义和总路线的东风，吹起三昧真火，烧掉我们前进道路上的一切魍魉。
