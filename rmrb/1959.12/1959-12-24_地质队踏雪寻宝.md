Xinhua News Agency Report:

Currently, on the Qinghai Plateau, the mountains are covered in snow and the earth is frozen. However, the thousands of geological exploration workers active on the Qinghai Plateau have broken with the usual practice of “leaving when the snow falls and frost arrives, and returning when the spring warms and flowers bloom,” and have begun large-scale field winter construction in the high mountains and barren salt lakes. Since the beginning of winter, they have successively discovered fifteen new mineral deposits, including mica, iron, and dolomite. On the exploration sites in the Qilian Mountains and the Qingshui River area, the drilling footage in November increased by 21.78% compared to October.

    地质队踏雪寻宝
    目前，青海高原大雪漫山，冰封土冻。可是活跃在青海高原上的几千名地质勘探职工，却打破历年
  “雪落霜降走，春暖花开来”的惯例，在崇山峻岭和戈壁盐湖间开始了大规模的野外冬季施工。入冬以来，他们已经先后发现云母、铁、白云岩等十五处新矿点，在祁连山、清水河一带的勘探工地上，十一月份的钻探进尺数比十月份增长百分之二十一点七八。
