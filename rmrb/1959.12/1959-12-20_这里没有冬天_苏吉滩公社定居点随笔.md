    No Winter Here
    Sketches from the Sujitan Commune Settlement
    By Our Correspondent Zhao Huaiqing
    Severe cold has descended upon the Qinghai grassland. On a slightly snowy evening, this reporter arrived at the Sujitan Commune settlement in the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. In the dim twilight, the ice and snow deeply locked the river, and newly built houses stretched along the riverbank into the misty distance. The cattle herds returned to their pens, and the children who had been dismissed from school chased and played with each other, running towards their respective houses and tents. The shops and factories were welcoming the busiest moment of the day. People who had forever escaped the life of moving with the water and grass, with satisfied smiles, were selecting their favorite daily necessities in the trading company.
    Late at night, I ran to the streets of the settlement to conduct interviews. The iron factory's furnace fire was like the summer evening glow, and the workers in the felt factory were rushing to make warm felt clothing for the herders participating in night grazing.
    Even at this late hour, the songs of the herders came from the grassland. After settling down, animal husbandry production became more solid, more meticulous, and more efficient. Almost all the livestock in the entire Suji Brigade reached the top grade of fatness. For many years, livestock were always "fat in autumn, thin in winter, and dying in spring," but this year, surprisingly, they gained weight since the beginning of winter. Many ewes weighed a plump 150 to 160 pounds. An old herder said spiritedly, "The ewes are even bigger than the castrated rams. I've been herding livestock my whole life and never seen such fatness."
    In the Sujitan Commune settlement, production is bustling with enthusiasm. Ice and snow cannot lock people's will and strength to conquer nature. Severe cold no longer brings people tears and death. Apart from the natural scenery of yellow grass and floating snow, it seems as if there is no winter here.
          A Family in the Settlement
    One afternoon, I stepped on the snow in the grassland and visited the home of Manjuedan, the Party Secretary of the commune. The red flag of an outstanding herder, hoisted high in front of his tent, attracted passers-by.
    This was a quite spacious tent, surrounded by wooden boxes and grain sacks, and sets of brand-new leather robes and bedding trimmed with pulu cloth were stacked on the boxes. Manjuedan's wife was busy cooking dinner; Manjuedan and his eldest son, Manxita, were enthusiastically discussing state affairs while reading newspapers. After settling down, conditions were created for them to study culture, and the father and son had become literate and educated people.
    Secretary Manjuedan talked to me about the family's past, saying, "Those who have suffered will understand the meaning of today's happiness even more." In the old society, he did not have his own cattle and sheep and worked as a slave for the herdowner in exchange for leftover scraps. When he really couldn't survive, he wandered to other villages. After liberation, the Party supported poor herdsmen in developing production, and through cooperativization and communization, life rose step by step. The whole family ate well and dressed warmly, especially after settling down, life became stable, and for the first time, they had a warm home. In recent years, six people have been added to their family, making it a large family of thirteen people. One daughter is a teacher at the Xining National Normal School; two daughters are studying at the settlement's elementary school. Last year, the family's income was more than 1,000 yuan, and this year it has increased more than doubled. The new life has stimulated the family's enthusiasm for production. The eldest son, Manxita, is an outstanding herder in the province and a national activist in socialist construction. He has summarized a complete set of work experience in grazing, preventing frostbite, lambing, and raising young animals. Now, this experience is being spread more and more widely throughout the province.
    By this time, it was already dark outside the window, and the wild wind in the wilderness was swirling through the withered grass. Mandale, the fourteen-year-old third daughter, who had just finished performing in a play, ran in singing and dancing. She was lively and generous and was a small actor with graceful dance moves and a melodious voice on the stage. Today, she performed in a play written by the teachers called "Lamb Mother," which told the story of a female commune member. This "Lamb Mother" who was praised for loving lambs like her own children was none other than the performer's sister-in-law, Du Ga Shiji, the wife of Manxita.
    I couldn't help but admire them, saying, "Your whole family is very capable!" Secretary Manjuedan said meaningfully, "We cannot forget how this honor and this good life came about. We cannot fail to live up to the Party's cultivation. Without the Party, there would be no family like ours!"
        The Cowherd Became a Tractor Driver
    In the settlement, many new figures have emerged. The new life prompted them to pursue things that they dared not imagine yesterday. The socialist revolution in pastoral areas, communization, and moving towards settlement have given the working herdsmen's thoughts wings.
    Would you like to know how an ordinary herder, Hashenghua, became a tractor driver? In the old society, he herded cattle for the herdowner from the age of ten. After liberation, in 1957, he joined the local pastoral cooperative. One spring morning, a huge iron object suddenly appeared on the land of the Haomen Farm, rushing towards him with a rumble, and the large iron piece hanging on its rear cut the frozen land into deep trenches. This scene immediately attracted Hashenghua. He panted heavily and ran from one end of the field to the other, and then chased from the other end to this end. When the tractor stopped, he jumped on it rashly, curiously moving this and touching that. He inadvertently stepped on a piece of iron, and with a "boom," the iron object vibrated, and he almost fell off it. The tractor driver saw it and said a few words to him. He didn't say anything and ran to ask the assistant, "What is this thing, so powerful!" The assistant told him it was a "tractor for reclaiming wasteland."
    "If I could also learn to drive this iron object and reclaim large areas of wasteland so that the herdsmen could grow their own grain, that would be great!" From then on, Hashenghua kept thinking about learning to drive a tractor. He asked the cadres to learn to drive a tractor when he saw them, and he dreamed of learning to drive a tractor, and sometimes he laughed happily in his dreams.
    After communization and settlement, according to the Party's policy in pastoral areas of "mainly animal husbandry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations," the commune bought a tractor and decided to vigorously develop the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry and reclaim wasteland for cultivation. Who should be sent to learn to drive? The cadres first thought of Hashenghua. This made Hashenghua's dream come true. He couldn't wait to grow wings and fly to Xining. But he encountered unexpected difficulties when he was studying. He failed the first exam. In those days, he was very distressed, and terms like "internal combustion engine" and "carburetor" made him dizzy. At this time, the leaders encouraged him, and many classmates came to help him, boosting his enthusiasm for learning. Hashenghua thought, "Is there anything that people can't do? I don't believe that I can't drill a hole in pig iron." From then on, in order to connect with reality and deepen his understanding of what he had learned in class, whenever he had time, he would turn around the tractor, and even on Sundays, he would sit on the tractor and ponder: how does oil turn into gas? And how does it burn? And he often disassembled the machine parts to study. He used what he was most familiar with as a metaphor: isn't the fuel tank like a cow's mouth? The cow's nose and the air filter are almost the same. This deepened his understanding of the course.
    When Hashenghua returned to the cooperative after completing his studies, it was the spring plowing season, and he drove the tractor to plow the land on the grassland, completely immersed in the joy of labor. He got up early and worked late, without even bothering to eat. When he was happy, he worked from dark to dawn. The old people said, "The cowherd has learned to drive a tractor. With the leadership of the Communist Party, people's minds have also opened up!"
            A Time of Prosperous Population
    The newly built houses with earth and wood structures on both sides of the settlement's street are stacked on top of each other, supporting the clear sky that is as blue as the sea. The animal bones that used to be scattered on the grassland have disappeared, and the streets are swept very clean.
    In the settlement's hospital, I met several Han and Tibetan medical workers, who are the guardians of the health of the herdsmen. The young Han doctor, Comrade Wang Yintian, came here from Henan Province in January of this year. As soon as he arrived, he encountered a serious measles epidemic. Almost all the children in the entire settlement became ill. At that time, he was the only doctor, appearing in the outpatient department one moment and in the ward the next, treating more than a hundred patients a day. In those days, he was often awakened as soon as he lay down on the bed, braving the wind and snow to cross mountains and ridges to make house calls; he didn't even bother to eat every day, eating steamed buns while seeing patients. Under his diligent work and busy schedule, the measles were finally eradicated.
    After leaving the hospital, I went to the home of Old Han Nayoula. Old Man Nayoula pointed to the earthen walls around the tent and said, "Before settling down, the tent was leaking air on all sides. When the wind blew and it snowed, it rained heavily outside and drizzled inside. Now we have transformed it." The old man also kept praising his warm kang, saying that he had lived for nearly sixty years and had never enjoyed such great happiness. We walked into the tent. It seemed that the mistress of this house was very clean. Whether it was boxes, stoves, or toiletries, they were all tidied up neatly. Old Man Nayoula told me that the commune had allocated two newly built houses to him, and he would be able to move there soon, which would be even more comfortable than it is now. At this time, the two older children who were studying at school returned from school, and the little brother in his wife's arms was happily cooing. I couldn't help but marvel at this family with a thriving population. Nayoula's wife was busy making milk tea for us, saying, "In the past, we looked forward to the stars and the moon, but we couldn't even look forward to a baby. The suffering we women endured cannot be mentioned. We didn't even know what hygiene was, and we gave birth to babies sitting on cow dung. At that time, it was rare to see a baby in ten or eight tents. Look at them now, they are all dark and strong and running all over the street."
    Old Man Nayoula also told me this: Some time ago, he and his wife were both ill. He was weak all over and had yellow pus running down his face, and his wife had postpartum fever. Both of them were lying in bed and couldn't get up. The commune sent people to deliver white flour and meat, and Dr. Wang came to see them day and night. Soon, the old couple's illnesses were cured. Old Man Nayoula said, "In the past, we would have either died of illness or starved to death! Before liberation, I got arthritis and couldn't get out of bed and almost starved to death!"

    这里没有冬天
    苏吉滩公社定居点随笔
    本报记者　赵淮青
    严寒降临到青海草原。在一个微雪的傍晚，记者来到了海北藏族自治州苏吉滩公社定居点。暮色苍茫中，只见冰雪深锁着河水，新盖的房屋沿着河畔伸展到烟雾弥漫的远方。牛群归圈了，散学的儿童互相追逐着、戏嬉着，奔向各自的房屋和帐房。商店和工厂正迎接着一天最繁忙的时刻。永远摆脱逐水草而居的生活的人们，带着满意的笑容，在贸易公司挑选他们最心爱的日用品。
    夜深了，我跑到定居点的街道上去访问。铁器工厂的炉火像夏天的晚霞，制毡厂的工人正为参加夜牧的放牧员赶制保暖的毡衣。
    在这样的深夜，还从草原上传来了放牧员的歌声。定居以后，畜牧业生产作得更踏实、更细致，效率更高了。整个苏吉大队的牲畜，几乎全部达到了一等膘。多少年来，牲畜总是“秋肥、冬瘦、春死亡”，而今年令人惊异的是：入冬以来，个个增膘，许多母羊胖墩墩的足有一百五、六十斤重，有个老放牧员神彩奕奕地说：“母羊比羯羊还大，挡了一辈子牲畜，没见过这样的膘情”。
    在苏吉滩公社的定居点上，生产热气腾腾，冰雪锁不住人们征服自然的意志和力量，严寒不再带给人们眼泪和死亡，除了草黄雪飘的自然景象，这里仿佛没有冬天。
          定居点上一家人
    一天下午，我踏着草原上的积雪，访问了公社党委书记满角旦的家。他那帐房门前高插着一面优秀放牧员的红旗，吸引着过往的行人。
    这是一幢挺宽敞的帐房，周围摆满木箱和粮袋，箱上罗着一套套崭新的、镶着氆氇的皮袄和被褥。满角旦的妻子正在忙着烧晚饭；满角旦和他的大儿子满西塔正拿着报纸热烈地讨论着国家大事。定居以后，为他们创造了学习文化的条件，他们爷俩已经变成能读能写有文化的人了。
    满角旦书记对我谈到了这个家庭的过去，他说：“受过折磨的人才会更加理解今天幸福的意义。”在旧社会，他没有自己的牛羊，给牧主当奴隶换一口剩汤残饭。实在活不下去，就飘泊外乡。解放后党扶植贫苦牧民发展生产，经过合作化、公社化，生活更是步步高升。全家吃的饱、穿的暖，特别是定居后，生活安定了，第一次有了一个温暖的家。几年来他们家添了六口人，已经成了一个有十三口人的大家庭。一个女儿在西宁民族师范当教员；两个女儿在定居点小学读书。去年全家收入一千多元，今年猛增了一倍多。新的生活激发了全家的生产干劲，大儿子满西塔是全省优秀的放牧员，是全国青年社会主义建设积极分子，他总结出一整套的放牧、防冻、接羔、育幼的工作经验。现在，这些经验正越来越广泛地在全省传播。
    这时窗外已经漆黑，旷野的狂风，飞卷着枯草，帐房里温暖如春。十四岁的三女儿满达勒刚刚演完剧，唱着、跳着跑进来，她活泼大方，在舞台上是一个舞姿婆娑、歌喉嘹亮的小演员。今天他登台演出的，是老师们编写的一个叫“羊羔妈妈”的女社员的事迹。这位被人歌颂的爱羔如子的“羊羔妈妈”，不是外人，正是表演者的嫂嫂、满西塔的妻子杜尕什吉。
    我不由得羡慕地说：“你们一家子都能干得很！”满角旦书记意味深长地说：“我们不能忘记这荣誉、这好日子是怎么来的，不能辜负党的培养，没有党就没有我们这个家啊！”
        放牛娃当上了拖拉机手
    在定居点上，涌现出许多新人物。新的生活促使他们去追求那些昨天还不敢想像的事情。牧区社会主义革命、公社化、走向定居，使劳动牧民的思想插上了翅膀。
    你愿意知道一个普通的牧民哈生华是怎样成为拖拉机手的吗？旧社会他从十岁起就给牧主放牛，解放后，1957年参加了当地的牧业社。那年春天的一个早上，在浩门农场的地头上忽然出现了一个庞大的铁家伙，冲着他轰隆轰隆地跑来，屁股上挂的大铁片，把结冻的土地割成一道道深沟。这情景立刻把哈生华吸引住了。他呼呼地喘着气，从地这头跑到地那头，又从地那头追到地这头，当拖拉机停下来的时候，他竟莽莽撞撞地跳了上去，好奇地动动这，摸摸那，他无意中用脚踩了踩一块铁片片，“轰隆”一声，那铁家伙震动了一下，他差点从上面栽下来。被拖拉机驾驶员看见了，说了他几句。他没有说什么，又跑去问助手：“这是个啥东西呀，这么厉害！”助手告诉他是“拖拉机，开垦荒地的”。
    “如果我也能学会开这铁家伙，开垦大片荒地让牧民自己种粮食吃，那该多好呀”！从那时以后，哈生华就一直想着学开拖拉机，见了干部就要求学开拖拉机，作梦也梦见学会了开拖拉机，有时在梦中高兴地笑了起来。
    公社化、定居以后，根据党在牧区“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针，公社买了一部拖拉机，决定要大搞农牧结合，开荒种地。派谁去学习驾驶呢？干部们首先想到了哈生华。这一来，哈生华的理想实现了。他恨不能插上翅膀飞往西宁。但在学习时，却遇到了出乎意料的困难。第一次考试就没有及格。那些天，他苦恼透了，什么“内燃机”啦，“气化器”啦，把他弄得懵头转向。这时，领导上鼓励他，许多同学都来帮助他，鼓舞了他的学习劲头。哈生华想：“什么不是人干的，不信生铁就钻不上个眼眼”。从那以后，为了联系实际，加深对课堂上所学内容的理解，一有空，他就围着拖拉机转，甚至星期天也坐在拖拉机上琢磨：油是怎样变成气的？又怎么燃烧起来的？并常常拆开机器零件研究。他拿自己最熟悉的东西作比喻：燃油箱不是和牛的嘴一样吗？牛的鼻子和空气滤清器倒是差不多。这就加深了对课程的理解。
    当哈生华学习结业回到社里的时候，正是春耕时节，他开着拖拉机在草原上耕地，完全沉浸在劳动的欢乐中。起早摸黑，饭也顾不得吃。一高兴，就从黑夜干到天明。老人们说“放牛娃学会了开拖拉机，有了共产党的领导，人心也开窍啦！”
            人丁兴旺的日子
    定居点街道两旁新建成的土木结构的房子，层层叠叠，托着蓝得像海一样的明洁的晴空。过去散落在草原上的兽骨不见了，街道上打扫得十分干净。
    在定居点的医院里，我结识了几位汉、藏族医务工作者，他们是牧民群众健康的保卫者。那位年轻的汉族医生王印天同志，是今年元月从河南省来到这里的，刚到就碰上了严重的麻疹流行，整个定居点的孩子差不多全部染上了病。那时就他一个医生，一会儿出现在门诊部，一会儿出现在病房，一天要诊疗一百多个病人。在那些日子里，他常常刚刚躺在床上就被叫醒，冒着风雪，翻山越岭出诊；每天连饭也顾不得吃，一边啃馒头，一边看病。在他这种辛勤的工作和奔忙下，麻疹终于被扑灭了。
    出了医院，我到了纳有拉老汉家。纳有拉老汉指着帐房周围的土墙说：“定居前，帐房四周围透风，刮风下雪，外边大下，里面小下，现在我们把它改造了。”老人还不停地称赞他的热炕，他说他活了将近六十岁，破天荒享了这么大福。我们走进帐房，看来这个家的女主人很爱干净，不论箱子、锅灶、洗脸用具，都收拾得很整洁。纳有拉老汉告诉我，公社分给他两间新盖的房子，不久就可搬过去，比现在还要舒适。这时在学校念书的两个大孩子散学回来了，妻子怀里抱着的小弟弟，高兴地呀呀直叫。我禁不住赞叹这个人丁兴旺的家庭。纳有拉的妻子一边忙着为我们烧奶茶，一边说，“以前盼星星盼月亮，也盼不到个娃娃，我们女人们受的罪就不能提了。根本不懂得什么叫讲卫生，坐在牛粪上生娃娃，那时候，十个八个帐房也难得见到个娃娃，你看现在，一个个又黑又壮满街跑。”
    纳有拉老汉还告诉了我这样一件事情：前一个时期他和老伴都病了。他浑身无力脸上直淌黄脓水，老伴得了产后褥热病，两个人都躺在床上起不来。公社差人送来白面和肉，王医生不管白天黑夜跑来给他们看病。不久，他老俩口的病都好了。纳有拉老汉说：“要在以前呀，病不死也得饿死！解放前我得了关节炎，起不来床就差点饿死了！”（附图片）
