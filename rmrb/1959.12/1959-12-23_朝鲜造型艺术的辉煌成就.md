　　The culture and art of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has a long history, and the fine arts of the Lee Dynasty had already reached a very high artistic level, with a unique national style. During the period of Japanese imperialist aggression, it was subjected to certain devastation. However, under the leadership of the Party, revolutionary artists also used their art as a sharp weapon to constantly encourage the Korean people to oppose the enemy's aggression, so that art was more closely linked to the people's thoughts and feelings. Since the establishment of the Republic, Korean artists have enthusiastically responded to the great call of the Party and the government, further inherited and developed Korea's inherent national cultural and artistic traditions, and actively participated in the practical labor of socialist construction in factories and rural areas. Because artists have deeply entered the struggle life, not only has the subject matter of creation been enriched, but also the leap-forward development of Korean culture and art has been promoted.
    Many outstanding works in this "North Korean Fine Arts Exhibition" fully prove that whether it is Korean painting, oil painting, sculpture, crafts, printmaking, or propaganda painting, they are all expressed by the authors through profound life experiences and appropriate artistic images, and the broad masses of Chinese audiences can also deeply appreciate this artistic language. Here are a few works to talk about my personal observations: For example, the oil painting "Sowing on New Land" (by Han Xiangyi), this painting first gives the audience the feeling that it is not only the color harmony of the sunlight projected on the characters, but also makes people realize the joy and yearning for a new life that blends in the depths of the hearts of these young workers. This oil painting has a high degree of skill, but the ability to master this skill and to use it well depends first on the author's thoughts and feelings and the proper handling of the theme content. Another example is Kim Seok-ryong's "Anti-Japanese Struggle of Coal Miners in Heunggyeong in 1930," which embodies the great perseverance and the magnificent momentum of the working class. If the author did not have a deep hatred for the enemy, this technique could not have been painted so movingly. Kim Seok-ryong's other painting, "Talking about Life Before Liberation," is obviously different from the previous one in composition, coloring, and brushwork, but the expression of memory in the eyes of the old man in the painting can also evoke people's sad scenes of the past peasants, making people think of today's happy life as something that has been exchanged through struggle. Other excellent works such as "March 1st," "Evening on the Daedong River," "Steelworkers," "Don't Forget the Enemy," "Farewell to the Volunteers," and many other excellent works with different themes, give people a deep impression and inspiration, which cannot be said to be achieved solely from the height of the technique and the characteristics of oil painting. Korean oil painters have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and have also seriously studied their own national traditional art to form their own new style and skills. In addition, in their sculptures, crafts, and propaganda paintings, they also express the enthusiasm of the heroic Korean people's life struggle to build socialism through superb skills.
    In this exhibition, I feel most cordial about Korean paintings, because these works, especially in landscape, flower and bird figures, have a close relationship with our Chinese paintings. These works show the inherent style of Korean national art, and also show that Korean artists have made great contributions in inheriting tradition and promoting the new. Although they use traditional techniques, they are not limited to traditional expressions in the use of brush and ink, but have created new techniques and have a new look. This is especially reflected in the works of many Korean painters. For example, Seonwoo Dan's "Dawn of Daedong Gate," Kim Yong-joon's "Early Autumn" and "Dance," Lee Seok-ho's "Azaleas" and "Vietnamese Scenery," Lee Pal-chan's "Restoration of Pyongyang," and Jeong Jong-yeo's "Goseong People Support the Front Line" are all excellent works with a profound traditional art foundation, and at the same time, they are new works of art that are oriented towards life and the people. However, what deserves our attention and learning here is that all the exhibited works of Korean paintings attach great importance to the traditional foundation of line drawing and the diverse changes of ink painting techniques, especially in the modeling of figure paintings. For example, "Goseong People Support the Front Line" obviously has a certain realistic ability and combines traditional brushwork and ink techniques to shape the true image and spiritual characteristics of the Korean people. Another example is "Dance," which uses vivid and solid outlines and freely rendered thick and light brushwork to highlight the wonderful posture of the characters singing and dancing. These are not stiffly applying traditional forms and mechanically copying the techniques of the ancients, but carefully created by the author, thereby portraying the specific environment and mood of the characters in the paintings, which has an artistic charm that is worth appreciating.
    This exhibition has many things worth learning from for Chinese painters. There is no doubt that this is a very meaningful cultural exchange. I believe that our two countries will definitely have more opportunities to promote each other in the future and create a new art that prospers and serves socialist construction. (Attached picture)

### 朝鲜造型艺术的辉煌成就

　　朝鲜造型艺术的辉煌成就
　　蒋兆和
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的文化艺术具有悠久的历史，远在李朝时代的造型艺术即已达到很高的艺术水平。而且具有独特的民族风格。在日本帝国主义侵略时期，曾遭受到一定的摧残。但是在党的领导之下，革命的艺术家们也把自己的艺术当作犀利的武器，不断地鼓舞朝鲜人民去反对敌人的侵略，使艺术与人民的思想感情得到更紧密的联系。在共和国建立以来，朝鲜艺术家们热烈地响应党和政府的伟大号召，进一步继承和发展朝鲜固有的民族文化艺术传统，并且积极参加工厂、农村社会主义建设的实际劳动。由于艺术家们深入了斗争生活，不仅丰富了创作的题材，而且也促进了朝鲜的文化艺术的飞跃发展。
    这次“朝鲜造型艺术展览会”展出中的许多杰出的作品，完全可以证明不论是朝鲜画、油画、雕塑、工艺、版画、宣传画等，都是作者通过深刻的生活感受和用恰当的艺术形象表现出来的，我们中国的广大的观众也能深刻地体会到这种艺术语言。这里略举一些作品谈谈我个人的观感：比如油画“在新土地上播种后”（作者韩湘翊），此画首先给观众们的感觉，不仅是阳光投射在人物形象上的色彩调和，而更使人觉察到这些年轻的劳动者内心深处融和着的喜悦和对新生活的向往。这幅油画具有高度的技巧，但是掌握这种技巧与善于运用技巧的能力，首先决定于作者的思想感情和主题内容的恰当处理。再如金奭龙的“1930年新兴煤矿工人的反日斗争”，体现出了工人阶级伟大的毅力和磅礴千古的气势。这种技巧，如果不是作者对敌人有深刻的仇恨，是不能画得如此感人的。金奭龙所作的另一幅画“谈谈解放前的生活”，在构图和设色以及笔法等都显然与前一幅不同，但通过画中老人眼睛里那种回忆的表情也能唤起人们对过去农民的悲惨的情景，使人联想到今天幸福的生活是经过斗争才换来的。其他如“三月一日”、“大同江的傍晚”、“炼钢的人们”、“不要忘记仇人”、“欢送志愿军”、以及许多不同主题的优秀作品，之所以给人以深刻的印象和启示，这都不能说是单从技巧的高度和油画的特点所能获得的成功。朝鲜的油画家们学习了苏联的先进经验，又认真学习了自己民族的传统艺术才形成了自己新的风格和技巧。此外在他们的雕塑、工艺、以及宣传画等方面，也是通过精湛的技巧而表现了英雄的朝鲜人民的生活斗争建设社会主义的热情。
    在这个展览会中的朝鲜画，使我最感到亲切。因为这些作品特别是在山水花鸟人物方面，同我们中国画有密切的关系。这些作品表现出了朝鲜民族艺术的固有风格，也说明了朝鲜艺术家们在继承传统推陈出新方面作出了很大的贡献。他们虽然运用了传统的技法，但在笔墨的运用上又完全不局限于传统的表现方法，而又创造了新的技巧，有了新的面貌。这特别体现在朝鲜许多画家们的作品中。例如鲜于澹的“大同门的黎明”、金熔俊的“初秋”和“舞”、李硕镐的“映山红花”与“越南风景”、李八灿的“恢复平壤”、郑钟汝的“固城人民支援前线”等杰作中，都是具有深厚传统的艺术基础，同时又是面向生活面向人民的新的艺术作品。不过这里值得我们注意和学习的，是朝鲜画所有展出的作品，非常重视传统的白描造型基础和水墨技法的多样变化。尤其是在人物画的造型上有了卓越的成绩。如“固城人民支援前线”，显然具有一定的写实能力又结合传统的笔法墨法，塑造出了朝鲜人民的真实形象和精神特征。再如“舞”这幅作品，以生动而又结实的勾线和浑染自如的浓淡笔法，突出了人物载歌载舞的美妙姿态。这些都不是生硬套用传统的形式和生搬古人的技法，而是经过作者精心的创造，从而刻划出画中人物特定的环境和心情。具有耐人欣赏的艺术魅力。
    这次展览，值得我们中国画家学习借鉴的地方很多。无可怀疑这是一次很有意义的文化交流。相信我们两国今后一定会有更多的机会互相促进，繁荣昌盛为社会主义建设服务的新艺术。（附图片）
