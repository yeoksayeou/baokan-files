　　The Great Power of Mongolian-Han Cooperation
    Investigation by the Investigation Team of the Jama Tu People's Commune of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　The Jama Tu People's Commune in the Horqin Left Wing Middle Banner of the Jirem League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is a large-scale people's commune established in a mixed Mongolian and Han area. It was formed by merging two districts, ten townships, and one hundred and four advanced agricultural production cooperatives, covering an area of more than 2,500 square kilometers. It is a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral commune, mainly agricultural, with about one million mu of arable land, of which more than 500,000 mu are cultivated; the boundless natural pastures can graze 100,000 head of livestock; in the northern wilderness grows a large stretch of lush "Black Forest", covering an area of more than 260 square kilometers; it also has inexhaustible alkaline soil. The Mongolian and Han people living in this area total more than 44,500, of which more than 18,000 are Mongolian. The facts of the past year have proved that in this area, not only has the people's commune been established, but it has also been run very well, accomplishing many things that advanced cooperatives could not accomplish, demonstrating the superiority of the people's commune's "large size and high degree of public ownership."

　　Everyone in the Commune is of One Mind

　　The residential situation of the Mongolian and Han people in the Jama Tu People's Commune is large-scale mixed residence and small-scale concentrated residence. This interlaced residential condition has led to economic connections and cultural exchanges between them for a long time. During the democratic revolution, under the leadership of the Party, the Mongolian and Han people eliminated the exploitation and oppression of princes, nobles, and landlords, and established brotherly fighting friendship in the heated class struggle. During the socialist revolution, they actively responded to the Party's call, jointly participated in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and in the upsurge of agricultural socialist transformation in the winter of 1955, they established forty-four advanced cooperatives dominated by Mongolians, jointly run by Mongolians and Hans, and sixty advanced cooperatives dominated by Hans, jointly run by Mongolians and Hans. The cooperatives dominated by Mongolians generally have large pastures with abundant water and grass and a relatively high proportion of animal husbandry, but the farmland is thin; while the cooperatives dominated by Hans generally have more fertile farmland and higher agricultural technology, but lack sufficient pastures. In the past few years, the Mongolian and Han people have greatly developed production, improved their lives, and improved their socialist consciousness in the collective labor of advanced cooperatives, and their national friendship has been further enhanced. However, advanced cooperatives are, after all, economic organizations with a narrow scope of operation, and for the two ethnic groups to carry out large-scale economic cooperation, give full play to labor potential, rationally utilize natural resources, carry out large-scale farmland water conservancy basic construction, achieve agricultural and animal husbandry integration on a larger scale, run industry on a large scale, develop diversified operations, ensure the sustained leap forward of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, jointly improve lives, and develop the economy and culture of all ethnic groups, there are still great limitations.

　　This limitation became more prominent in the booming all-round Great Leap Forward in 1958. At this time, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a resolution on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas. The resolution, like a beacon, pointed out the correct direction to the masses in a timely manner. In just nine days, the "Dongfeng" and "Satellite" people's communes were established separately within the original two districts in the south and north. In this way, the Mongolian and Han people were able to cooperate on a larger scale and jointly develop economic and cultural undertakings. However, the Dongfeng Commune had a larger proportion of agriculture, and the Satellite Commune had a larger proportion of animal husbandry. The mutual support between the two communes for agriculture and animal husbandry and the comprehensive utilization of various resources were still limited to a certain extent. For example, the Su Tu, Tuanjie, and Xinhe management areas of the Dongfeng Commune and the Chagan and Dailiji management areas of the Satellite Commune have close relations in developing animal husbandry by utilizing pastures. It is more beneficial to combine them together, and combining them together can also organize more labor to participate in farmland water conservancy construction and run industry on a large scale. After nearly two months of deliberation and preparation, in November, the two communes merged into the current Jama Tu People's Commune.

　　Cooperate and Work Together to Build Water Conservancy

　　In the past year, as a result of the Jama Tu People's Commune's unified allocation of labor, rational utilization of means of production and natural resources on a larger scale, a large-scale cooperation between the two ethnic groups has been formed. Mongolian and Han commune members are working hand in hand on the production and construction front, creating many amazing feats, achieving the goal of common development and common improvement, and further strengthening national unity.

　　The Xin Kai River and Mao Lin River run through the commune, and water resources are quite abundant, but they often cause floods. Before liberation, people were unable to resist the ferocious floods and often begged the "spirits" to bless them. Some people threw fat pigs into the river to worship the "River God." After liberation, the Party led the masses to build dikes along the Xin Kai River, which basically controlled the flooding of the Xin Kai River, but until before the Great Leap Forward, only some scattered river dams were built on the Mao Lin River, which still could not completely control the floods. In 1958, the Mongolian and Han people jointly built two reservoirs; in 1959, the commune used its slack farming time to organize Mongolian and Han people to build two more reservoirs. These four reservoirs can store a total of 40 million cubic meters of water. In the autumn of 1959, relying on these reservoirs, it guaranteed a good harvest in the face of an unusually large flood that had not been encountered in sixty years.

　　Before communization, although the floods of the Xin Kai River were basically subdued, the strength of a village and a cooperative was weak, and it was impossible to develop water conservancy. The members of the Wujianfang Advanced Cooperative watched the water of the Xin Kai River flow away in vain every year and felt very sorry. In the spring of 1954, they built a dam to divert water for irrigation, but because the cooperative was small and weak, they did not dig irrigation canals, and as a result, they did not irrigate the land. After the establishment of the commune, under the unified leadership of the commune, the Mongolian and Han people launched a comprehensive water conservancy construction. More than 2,000 people, starting from November 1958, mustered soaring enthusiasm, braved the cold weather, worked hard for more than four months, dug up frozen soil, compacted canal embankments, dug more than 482,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and built 132 irrigation canals with a total length of 134 kilometers. In the spring of 1959, they diverted water to irrigate 57,000 mu of land, overcame the severe spring drought, and protected all the seedlings.

　　Many production teams in the Tuanjie and Xinhe management areas are located in low-lying areas. When it rains heavily, they become a vast expanse of water, and about 20,000 mu of land are often subject to waterlogging and poor harvests. In the past, each advanced cooperative also carried out some drainage projects from its own local interests, but this led to the problem of "upstream drainage and downstream suffering," and disputes occurred between townships and cooperatives every year. In 1959, during the busy summer hoeing season, the commune organized more than 700 Mongolian and Han commune members and spent only eight and a half days digging a drainage ditch 29 li long and 5 meters wide. Although the rainfall in 1959 was much greater than in 1958, the waterlogged land was reduced to about 40 mu, and disputes over drainage were permanently eliminated. The Mongolian and Han people happily said: This is a veritable "Unity Canal"!

　　Deep Plowing Shows its Power

　　The history of agriculture here is only a few decades, especially due to the large land area and small population. Farming techniques have always been extensive. Some places still use primitive farming methods such as "broadcasting seeds." Until the advanced cooperative, the amount of autumn plowing and fertilization was still very small. After communization, a booming autumn plowing and deep plowing movement was immediately launched. More than 12,300 Mongolian and Han commune members participated in the struggle for autumn plowing, and they also made full use of the advantageous conditions of having more draught animals in this commune. The Dailiji, Su Tu, Gulu Mangha, and other management areas, which are mainly Mongolian, transferred more than 4,000 draught animals to support the Xinhe, Tuanjie management areas, which are mainly Han, and sold them more than 400 draught cattle. Although the Mongolian women in Dongchaganjili did not understand the Han language, they automatically brought shovels to help when they heard that the Tuanjie village had difficulties in completing the deep plowing task. Thanks to the large-scale cooperation between Mongolian and Han commune members, more than 320,000 mu of land (including 23,000 mu of deep-plowed land) were plowed in just 26 days, over fulfilling the task of autumn plowing and deep plowing, which is more than double the total amount of land plowed in the 13 years since liberation. During the autumn plowing and deep plowing movement, the masses were full of enthusiasm and adopted the method of "resting people and resting cattle but not resting ploughs" and "division of labor and cooperation, shift work," which doubled the efficiency of plowing. In the past, a double-wheel double-share plough pulled by four cattle could only plow more than six mu of land a day. Now, the number of cattle has been increased to eight to sixteen, and two to four shifts are implemented. Pulling a double-wheel double-share plough can generally plow more than 20 mu of land in one day and night.

　　While focusing on water and soil, a manure accumulation and delivery movement was also launched. Commune members used the advantageous conditions of having more fertilizer, more vehicles, and more horses, and the amount of fertilizer applied increased by 44% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Thanks to the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, especially the unprecedented bumper harvest of large areas of high-yielding fields, although there were spring droughts, autumn floods, and insect pests in 1959, and the disasters were similar to those in 1957, agricultural production still achieved a special leap forward. The total output of grain and oil is expected to reach 84 million jin, an increase of 69.1% compared to 1957 and an increase of 28.7% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In 1959, the grain and oil sold to the state will account for more than 60% of the total output.

　　Reasonable Regulation of Grass Pastures

　　The Jama Tu People's Commune conscientiously implemented the policy of giving equal importance to agriculture and animal husbandry. Within the entire commune, it reasonably regulated and appropriately expanded grass pastures, carried out large-scale basic construction of animal husbandry, and strengthened support for and leadership of animal husbandry production, so that livestock, especially cattle and horses, have developed by leaps and bounds.

　　The distribution of grass pastures in the Jama Tu Commune is very uneven. The pastures of the 37 production teams in the Dailiji, Su Tu, Gulu Mangha, and Chaganjili management areas account for 70% of the commune's pastures; the 25 production teams in the Xinhe, Tuanjie, and other management areas lack pastures, and the development of animal husbandry is very slow, and some even decline year by year. On the basis of strengthening socialist and communist education, the Party Committee and Management Committee of the commune organized the production teams to consult with each other and reasonably regulate 355 square kilometers of grass pastures, solving the disputes caused by the use of grass pastures between townships and cooperatives that had not been completely resolved in the past.

　　After the establishment of the commune, it unified the arrangements for agricultural and animal husbandry production, mobilized forces to strengthen animal husbandry production and basic construction of animal husbandry, and overcame the previous phenomenon of "grasping agriculture and abandoning animal husbandry." All production teams have established animal husbandry professional groups or teams, and the labor force invested in animal husbandry production has increased by nearly doubled compared to 1958. A total of 64 wells for animal husbandry were drilled, and 773 new and expanded livestock sheds and 307 livestock pens were built. The commune strongly supported animal husbandry production, established a veterinary hospital and eleven veterinary clinics, equipped each animal husbandry professional group with 110 livestock health workers, carried out animal epidemic prevention and control work, and stopped the spread of two outbreaks of rinderpest.

　　The unified leadership of the commune and the further integration of agriculture and animal husbandry have brought about an unprecedented bumper harvest in animal husbandry. Animal husbandry production has developed faster than in any previous year. The total number of livestock in 1959 reached 44,229, and the total breeding rate of large livestock was 19%. This is an unprecedented high speed in the local area.

　　Diversified Operations Develop Greatly

　　Jama Tu is a rich place. It not only has fertile farmland, abundant water resources, and large natural pastures, but also has inexhaustible alkaline soil and many precious wild birds and animals, as well as more than 30 kinds of wild plants, which are very suitable for running industry on a large scale and engaging in diversified operations.

　　There are two large wasteland areas here, covering a total area of 360 square kilometers, which are rich in alkaline soil. The large wasteland near Qikeshu is commonly known as the "Golden Basin," but it has always been dim in the past. Before communization, although some people came to "collect treasures" during the slack farming season, because they were working individually, they could only take care of boiling the alkali but not selling it, and they could not earn much money. After the establishment of the commune, it immediately organized more than 800 people to sweep alkaline soil on the two wasteland areas. After more than two months of hard work, they swept more than 27 million jin, accumulating sufficient raw materials for year-round alkali boiling, and also collected enough firewood for one year of alkali boiling. The commune also invested in 129 large pots and 1,529 small pots, fixed more than 300 workers, and established two large alkali plants. From November 1958 to October 1959, they boiled a total of 1.95 million jin of alkali, of which 400,000 jin were soda ash, with a total output value of more than 240,000 yuan. The once desolate "Golden Basin" is now shining brightly, with chimneys standing tall, houses in pieces, busy traffic, and noisy voices. Piles of alkali crystals sparkle in the golden sunlight. Passers-by cannot help but praise and say, "Golden Basin, Golden Basin, it really lives up to its name!"

　　In addition to running two alkali plants, the People's Commune has also established six factories serving agricultural and animal husbandry production and people's lives, such as iron and wood, weaving, pulp, dairy processing, bricks and tiles, and power generation. From November 1958 to October 1959, the total industrial output value has reached more than 549,000 yuan.

　　While organizing a great leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production, the commune, in accordance with the policy of comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, allocated labor, engaged in 13 kinds of sideline production such as raising pigs, chickens, bees, fish, collecting apricot kernels and medicinal materials, cutting reeds, and running transportation, greatly increasing income. From November 1958 to October 1959, sideline income has exceeded one million yuan, more than five times the sideline income in the year before communization.

　　Starting to Move Towards Mechanization

　　The establishment of the commune makes it easier to realize agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization. From their own personal experience, Mongolian and Han commune members have seen that agricultural mechanization reduces labor intensity, increases labor productivity, and can free up a large number of laborers to run industry and diversified operations, greatly increasing commune accumulation and commune member income. Therefore, they have developed a strong interest in mechanization and their demands are more urgent. In the year since the establishment of the commune, it has invested 140,000 yuan in agricultural mechanization and plans to invest another 800,000 yuan in the next three years.

　　With the development of commune industry and agricultural mechanization, the ranks of minority workers are also constantly growing and expanding. In the past year, 221 Mongolian workers have been trained, accounting for 37.2% of the total number of workers in the commune. Among them, there are 22 workers who have mastered tractor, power generation, and other technologies, accounting for 47% of the total number of skilled workers in the commune.

　　The commune's large-scale development of industry and diversified operations has enabled the commune's economy to develop rapidly. The public accumulation extraction in 1959 increased more than four times compared to 1958.

　　Now, all Mongolian and Han commune members are full of confidence in launching a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy. They are determined to thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, muster their energy, engage in large-scale autumn plowing, autumn irrigation, manure accumulation, building sheds and pens, and vigorously grasp sideline production, so as to prepare for continued leaps forward in 1960 and strive for a better life.

　　蒙汉大协作的强大威力
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会架吗吐人民公社调查组调查
    内蒙古自治区哲里木盟科尔沁左翼中旗的架吗吐人民公社，是在
  蒙、汉族杂居区办起来的一个规模很大的人民公社。它是由两个区、十
  个乡、一百零四个高级农业生产合作社合并成立的，面积二千五百多平方公里。它是一个半农、半牧、以农为主的公社，拥有可耕地约一百万亩，已耕土地五十多万亩；一望无际的天然牧场可以放养牲畜十万头；在北部的原野上生长着一大片苍郁茂密的“黑树林”，面积达二百六十多平方公里；它还有取之不尽的碱土。居住在这个地区的蒙、汉族人民共有四万四千五百余人，其中蒙古族有一万八千多人。一年来的事实证明，在这个地区，不但办成了人民公社，而且办的很出色，举办了许多高级社不能举办的事情，显示了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性。
    办公社人同此心
    架吗吐人民公社蒙、汉族人民的居住情况是大杂居、小聚居。这种插花居住的条件，使他们长期以来就发生了经济上的联系和文化上的交流。在民主革命时期，蒙、汉族人民在党的领导下，消灭了王公贵族和地主的剥削、压迫，在火热的阶级斗争中，建立了兄弟般的战斗友谊。在社会主义革命时期，他们积极响应党的号召，共同参加了互助合作运动，并在1955年冬农业社会主义改造高潮中，建立了以蒙古族为主，蒙、汉族联合的高级社四十四个，以汉族为主，蒙、汉族联合的高级社六十个。以蒙古族为主的社，一般都有水草丰美的大片牧场，牧业比重较大，但农田较薄；而以汉族为主的社，农田一般比较肥沃，农业技术也较高，但都缺乏足够的牧场。几年来，蒙、汉族人民在高级社的集体劳动中，大大地发展了生产，改善了生活，提高了社会主义觉悟，民族友谊也有了进一步的增进。但是，高级社毕竟还是经营范围狭小的经济组织，对于两个民族实行经济大协作，充分发挥劳动潜力，合理利用天然富源，大搞农田水利基本建设，在更大的范围内实现农、牧结合，大办工业，开展多种经营，保证工、农、牧业的持续跃进，共同改善生活，发展各民族的经济和文化，都还有很大的局限性。
    这种局限性在1958年轰轰烈烈的全面大跃进中，更显得突出了，正在这时，中共中央发布了关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议，决议像灯塔一样，适时地给群众指出了正确的方向。仅九天时间，就在南部和北部的原两个区的范围内，分别建立了“东风”和“卫星”两个人民公社。这样，就使蒙、汉族人民能够在更大范围内进行协作，共同发展经济和文化事业。可是东风公社的农业比重较大，卫星公社的牧业比重较大，两个社对于农、牧业互相支援和各种资源的综合利用，仍有一定的限制。例如东风公社的苏吐、团结、新河等管理区与卫星公社的查干、代力吉两个管理区，在利用牧场发展畜牧业方面，有着密切的关系，合在一起更为有利，而且合在一起还可以组织更多的劳动力，参加农田水利建设和大办工业。经过近两个月的酝酿和准备，到11月份，这两个公社又合并成现在的架吗吐人民公社。
    协作一致大兴水利
    一年来，架吗吐人民公社在更大范围内统一调配劳动力、合理利用生产资料和自然资源的结果，形成了两个民族之间的大协作。蒙、汉族社员在生产建设战线上携手并进，创造出许多惊人的事迹，达到了共同发展、共同提高的目的，进一步加强了民族团结。
    新开河和茂林河纵贯公社境内，水利资源相当丰富，但是常常泛滥成灾。解放前，人们在凶恶的洪水面前无力抗御，往往乞求“神灵”保佑，有的人把肥猪投入河水祭祀“河神”。解放后，党领导群众在新开河沿岸修了堤防，基本控制了新开河的泛滥，但直到大跃进以前，在茂林河上只筑起一些零星的拦河坝，仍然不能完全控制水患。1958年，蒙、汉族人民共同修了两个水库；1959年，公社利用农闲时间，又组织蒙、汉族人民修了两个水库。这四个水库共可蓄水四千万公方。1959年秋天，依靠这些水库，在六十年来未遇到过的特大洪水的进攻下，保证了丰收。
    公社化前，虽然基本上制服了新开河的洪水，但一村一社的力量单薄，无法开发水利。五间房高级社的社员们，年年看着新开河的水白白地流走，觉得非常可惜，他们在1954年春天，曾建筑起一条拦河坝，想引水浇地，但由于社小力量薄，没有挖成灌溉渠道，结果没有浇成地。公社成立后，蒙、汉族人民在公社的统一领导下，展开了全面的水利建设。二千多人从1958年11月开始，鼓足冲天干劲，不怕天寒地冻，苦战四个多月，刨开了冻土，夯实了渠埂，挖了四十八万二千多土方，修成了一百三十二条灌溉渠道，总长度达到一百三十四公里，在1959年春天，就引水灌溉了五万七千亩土地，战胜了严重的春旱，保住了全苗。
    团结和新河两个管理区的很多生产队处于洼地，雨量大时，一片汪洋，常年因内涝而歉收的土地约有二万多亩，过去各高级社也曾经从本身的局部利益出发，做了一些排涝工程，但这样又出现了“上游排涝，下游遭殃”的问题，乡与乡、社与社之间年年发生纠纷。1959年，公社在夏锄紧张时期，组织了七百多个蒙、汉族社员，仅用八天半的时间，就挖了一条二十九里长、五米宽的排水渠。1959年降雨量虽比1958年大的多，但内涝的土地却减少到四十来亩，并且永远消除了排涝上的纠纷。蒙、汉族人民都高兴地说：这是一条名副其实的“团结渠”！
    深翻土地显威力
    这里经营农业的历史只有几十年的光景，特别是由于地多人少。耕作技术一向粗放，个别地方还沿用着“漫撒籽”等原始的耕作方法，直到高级社时，秋翻、施肥的数量还很少。公社化后，立即掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的秋翻、深翻运动，一万二千三百多名蒙、汉族社员参加了秋翻的斗争，还充分地运用了这个社耕畜多的有利条件。以蒙古族为主的代力吉、苏吐、古鲁忙哈等管理区，调出了四千多头耕畜支援了以汉族为主的新河、团结管理区，并卖给他们四百多头耕牛。东查干吉的蒙古族妇女虽然不懂汉话，可是听说团结屯完成深翻任务有困难，也自动带着铁锹前去帮忙。由于蒙、汉族社员大协作，在短短的二十六天内，就翻完了三十二万多亩土地（其中深翻地二万三千亩），超额完成了秋翻和深翻的任务，比解放以来十三年的翻地总和还多一倍。在秋翻、深翻运动中，群众干劲冲天，采取了“歇人歇牛不歇犁”和“分工协作轮班作业”的办法，成倍地提高了翻地效率。过去一台四头牛拉的双轮双铧犁，一天只能翻六亩多地，现在把牛增加到八头到十六头，实行二班到四班倒，拉一台双轮双铧犁，在一昼夜里，一般都能翻二十来亩地。
    在大抓水、土的同时，又开展了积肥、送粪运动。社员们利用肥多、车多、马多的优越条件，施肥量比大跃进的1958年还增加44％。由于认真贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，特别是由于大面积高额丰产田获得了空前大丰收，1959年虽然春旱、秋涝，又有虫害，灾害和1957年差不多，但农业生产仍然实现了特大跃进，粮食和油料总产量预计可以达到八千四百万斤，将比1957年增产69.1％，比大跃进的1958年增产28.7％。1959年卖给国家的粮食和油料将占总产量的60％以上。
    合理调剂草牧场
    架吗吐人民公社认真贯彻执行了农牧业并举的方针，在全社范围内，合理调剂和适当扩大了草牧场，大搞牧业基本建设，加强了对牧业生产的支援和领导，使牲畜特别是牛、马有了飞跃的发展。
    架吗吐公社草牧场分布很不平衡，代力吉、苏吐、古鲁忙哈、查干吉四个管理区的三十七个生产队的牧场，占全社牧场的70％；新河、团结等管理区的二十五个生产队缺少牧场，牧业发展很缓慢，甚至有的还逐年下降。公社党委会和管委会，在加强社会主义和共产主义教育的基础上，组织各生产队互相协商，合理调剂出草牧场三百五十五平方公里，解决了过去没有彻底解决的乡社之间因使用草牧场而引起的争执。
    公社成立以后，统一安排了农牧业生产，调动力量加强了牧业生产和牧业基本建设，克服了以往那种“抓住农业，丢掉牧业”的现象。各生产队都成立了牧业专业组或小队，投入牧业生产的劳动力比1958年增加了将近一倍。共打了牧业用井六十四眼，新建和扩建牲畜棚七百七十三间、牲畜圈三百零七所。公社以很大力量支持了牧业生产，建立了一所兽医院和十一处兽医室，给各牧业专业组配备了一百一十名牲畜保健员，开展了防治畜疫工作，制止了两次牛瘟的蔓延。
    公社的统一领导，农牧业的进一步结合，带来了牧业的空前大丰收。牧业生产比以往任何一年都发展得快，1959年度的牲畜总头数达到四万四千二百二十九头，大牲畜的总增殖率为19％。这是当地空前未有的高速度。
    多种经营大发展
    架吗吐是个富饶的地方，不但有肥沃的农田，丰富的水利资源，大片的天然牧场，而且有取之不尽的碱土和很多珍贵的野禽、野兽，以及三十多种野生植物，很适宜于大办工业和大搞多种经营。
    这里有两个大荒滩，面积共三百六十平方公里，盛产碱土。在七棵树附近的那个大荒滩，俗称“金盆”，但过去一直暗淡无光。公社化前，虽然农闲时有些人来“取宝”，因为是单干，顾了熬，顾不了卖，挣不到多少钱。公社成立后，立即组织八百多人到两块荒滩上扫碱土，经过两个多月的苦战，扫了二千七百多万斤，给常年熬碱积存了充足的原料，还打够了一年熬碱用的烧柴。公社又投资置备了一百二十九口大锅、一千五百二十九口小锅，固定了三百多个工人，建立了两个大碱厂，从1958年11月到1959年10月，共熬了一百九十五万斤碱，其中纯碱为四十万斤，总产值达到二十四万多元。昔日荒凉的“金盆”，而今大放异彩，烟囱林立，房屋成片，车水马龙，人声喧腾，大堆的碱晶体在金色太阳光下闪闪发光。过路人莫不啧啧赞美，连说：“金盆，金盆，真是名不虚传！”
    人民公社除办成两个碱厂外，还办成了铁木、编织、纸浆、乳品加工、砖瓦、发电等六个为农、牧业生产和人民生活服务的工厂。从1958年11月到1959年10月，工业总产值已经达到五十四万九千多元。
    公社在组织工、农、牧业生产大跃进的同时，根据综合发展农、林、牧、副、渔业的方针，调配劳动力，大搞养猪、养鸡、养蜂、养鱼、采集杏核和药材、割芦苇、跑运输等十三种副业生产，大大增加了收入。从1958年11月到1959年10月，副业收入已超过一百万元，比公社化前一年的副业收入增加了五倍多。
    开始走向机械化
    公社的成立，更便于实现农业机械化和半机械化。蒙、汉族社员们从亲身体验中，看到农业机械化减轻了劳动强度，提高了劳动生产率，能腾出大批劳动力来举办工业和多种经营，大大增加了公社积累和社员收入。因此，他们对机械化发生了浓厚的兴趣，要求也更加迫切了。公社建立一年来，已在农业机械化上投资了十四万元，并计划在今后三年内再投资八十万元。
    随着公社工业和农业机械化的发展，少数民族工人队伍也在不断地成长壮大。一年来培养了二百二十一个蒙古族工人，占全社工人总数的37.2％。其中掌握拖拉机、发电等技术的工人有二十二名，占全社技术工人总数的47％。
    公社大办工业和大搞多种经营，就使公社经济迅速发展起来。1959年公共积累的提成，又比1958年增加四倍多。
    现在，全体蒙、汉族社员正满怀信心地开展声势浩大的增产节约运动，他们决心要反透右倾，鼓足干劲、大搞秋翻、秋浇、积肥、搭棚盖圈，大抓副业生产，为1960年继续跃进作好准备，为争取更美好的生活而奋斗。
