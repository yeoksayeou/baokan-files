Sino-Western Cooperation Explores the "Treasure Trove"
By our reporter Liu Peheng

    One afternoon, in the internal medicine ward of the affiliated hospital of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, I met Liang Guangye, a forestry worker. With a joyful smile, he pulled up his shirt and told me, "Now you can't tell I'm an ascites patient, can you? In the past, my belly was so swollen with ascites that I couldn't even button up such a wide shirt. I really have to thank the Party and Chairman Mao, and thank the good doctors he taught for giving me a new life." At this time, Dr. Lü Weibai, who was present, enthusiastically went on to introduce the patient's treatment. The patient came to the hospital nine months after suffering from cirrhosis of the liver with ascites. At that time, his skin was dark, his belly was very swollen, and the liver and spleen could not be felt during examination. After the cirrhosis research group used a treatment method that focused on attack and supplemented with tonification, with traditional Chinese medicine treatment as the main method, plus the auxiliary treatment of Western medicine, in just over half a month, the ascites was reduced a lot. The abdominal circumference decreased by seventeen centimeters, close to the size of a normal person. So far, it has not recurred for eight months.

    This is the good news brought to patients with cirrhosis of the liver and ascites by the joint scientific research on traditional Chinese medicine carried out by Chinese and Western medicine doctors in the internal medicine department of this hospital.

    People are no strangers to cirrhosis of the liver with ascites. It is a very stubborn and difficult disease, which is called "single abdominal distension" or "tympanites" in traditional Chinese medicine. This disease means that the liver has lost its compensatory ability, the ascites accumulates more and more, and the abdomen becomes larger and larger, so that the liver function gradually declines. Over the years, I don’t know how many people have lost their ability to work or even lost their lives due to this disease! Chinese and Western medicine doctors in the internal medicine department of the affiliated hospital of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine have listed this disease as a key project for scientific research this year, and used modern medical science methods to find out the rules of the unique traditional Chinese medicine therapy—"attacking water method" for the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver and ascites.

    "To explore the 'secrets' of the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine and conquer this medical fortress," the old traditional Chinese medicine doctor Huang Jianbai and the Western medicine doctors who have studied traditional Chinese medicine, such as Lü Weibai, Yu Rongqing, and Shi Dianbang, were all determined to do so. The cirrhosis research group they jointly formed decided to use modern medical science methods to sort out and study this traditional Chinese medicine therapy. When they found in a Chinese medicine magazine that the affiliated hospital of Tianjin Medical College used the traditional Chinese medicine "Tympanites Pill" to treat cirrhosis of the liver and ascites effectively, they immediately sent a doctor to "collect information."

    The main drug in "Tympanites Pill" is "Gansui", and "raw Gansui" is used, and the dosage is increased three times compared to the general dosage, so that the medicinal properties are stronger, and the patient has stronger reactions such as vomiting and nausea after taking it. How to further understand the medicinal properties of "Gansui" in order to reduce the painful reactions after patients take it is the first question the cirrhosis research group explored. They stayed in the library and read countless classical Chinese medicine documents to find theoretical basis. Sure enough, Zhang Zhongjing, a great medical scientist in the Eastern Han Dynasty, recorded more than a thousand years ago in "Synopsis of the Golden Chamber" and "Treatise on Febrile Diseases", that the famous "attacking water prescription" "Ten Jujube Decoction" is based on "Gansui". This further clarified that the "attacking water" method is a unique therapy of traditional Chinese medicine.

    At a discussion meeting, Dr. Huang Jianbai, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor with rich experience in "attacking method" treatment, introduced his understanding of the medicinal properties of "Gansui". He said: "For attacking prescriptions with 'Gansui' as the main ingredient, those decocted into soup are weaker and less effective than pills and powders." This practical experience is completely consistent with the results of animal experiments conducted by the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica to assist them. The experimental results also show that the effective components of "Gansui" are soluble in alcohol but not in water. These all made them more clear about the scientific basis of "Tympanites Pill" or "Gansui" preparations mostly being pills and powders. "It turns out that the dosage forms used in traditional Chinese medicine treatment have scientific basis!" Some Western medicine doctors have gained a deeper understanding of traditional Chinese medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine has also learned the scientific reason for using pills and powders for treatment for the first time from this research.

    Just as they were discussing the drug's reaction, Dr. Lü Weibai suggested wrapping the pills in "enteric coating" so that the drug taken by the patient would not dissolve in the stomach, the gastric mucosa would not be stimulated by the drug, and the drug would dissolve in the intestines to avoid or reduce the patient's reaction. Then, doctors Yu Rongqing, Shi Dianbang, Zhou Jianzhong and others cooperated with Dr. Tang Lingyun from the radiology department to conduct human experiments. One Sunday morning, they took pills made of barium sulfate wrapped in "enteric coating", then lay quietly in bed, and Dr. Tang Lingyun would fluoroscopically observe them at regular intervals to find out the rules that the drugs wrapped in "enteric coating" stayed in the stomach for about half an hour to an hour before reaching the intestines. In the laboratory, the staff of the pharmacy wrapped the "Tympanites Pill" in different layers of "enteric coating", and obtained some scientific rules from careful scientific observation and analysis.

    The doctors worked day and night tirelessly, and finally saw the effect in clinical practice. Patient Liu Zhenshan was an old patient in the hospital and had been hospitalized for more than a year. In the past, he had taken "Zhouche Pill" and other attacking agents 75 times. Every time he smelled the medicine, he vomited non-stop. The patient swallowed the medicine with tears in his eyes, but the amount of ascites disappeared very little. This time, he smoothly took the "Tympanites Pill" wrapped in "enteric coating". The reaction was mild, but the amount of diarrhea was large. Sometimes, he would have more than 2,000 milliliters of diarrhea at a time. In just over half a month, the abdominal circumference dropped from 112 centimeters to 93.5 centimeters. The patient smiled, and other patients gradually achieved the same good results by taking the improved "Tympanites Pill".

    The process of close integration of Chinese and Western medicine and the use of modern scientific methods to study this therapy of traditional Chinese medicine has made them further understand the correctness of the Party's traditional Chinese medicine policy. In the past, the old traditional Chinese medicine doctor Huang Jianbai was skeptical of Western medicine treatment. He always felt that Western medicine had nothing to offer in treatment, and that traditional Chinese medicine was "omnipotent" and had many methods. From the joint research with Western medicine on schistosomiasis liver cirrhosis ascites three years ago, plus this clinical research, he gradually eliminated the problems in his mind. When he recalled the painful scenes he had witnessed over the years of practice, in which many patients had vomiting and other reactions when taking attacking drugs, he also wanted to relieve the pain for the patients at that time, but he could not find a way. Now, wrapping the pills with "enteric coating", through the scientific research of Western medicine, reduces or eliminates the patient's painful reactions to taking medicine, expands the scope of patient treatment, and also researches some scientific basis for traditional Chinese medicine treatment. These facts not only make traditional Chinese medicine further understand science, but also deeply appreciate the correctness of the Party's policy of sorting out and studying traditional Chinese medicine with modern scientific methods. The Western medicine doctors who participated in the research also deeply realized that the medicine of the motherland is really a great treasure trove, and they were even more encouraged to explore this treasure trove and determined to continue to cooperate with traditional Chinese medicine to further carry out research activities. At that time, several young doctors talked almost every day: Ascites may grow and disappear at the same time, can we take continuous attacking methods? Before they had time to discuss it with Dr. Huang Jianbai, Old Doctor Huang came to them and was also talking about this issue. Based on his many years of clinical experience, he also wanted to try the continuous attacking method. A new research topic has been determined. Their research activities have also become more frequent. Dr. Lü Weibai found the Western medicine laxative - magnesium sulfate, which he had not paid attention to in the past, when reading internal medicine and other works. He recalled that in the past clinical treatment, he observed that in addition to the small amount of diarrhea, the biggest advantage of patients taking this drug was that they had no pain. Therefore, when using the improved "Tympanites Pill" for continuous attack, he also took some of this Western medicine alternately. At the same time, traditional Chinese medicine also used the tonification method, sometimes more attacking and less tonifying, sometimes more tonifying and less attacking. Generally, after more than half a month of treatment, the ascites would be reduced or close to disappeared. Patient Li Mengxun was admitted to the hospital in March this year. After five times of attacking water, the abdominal circumference was reduced from 93 centimeters to the normal abdominal circumference of 76 centimeters. After laboratory tests, the liver function was significantly improved, and he was discharged from the hospital after the National Day.

    If a patient with cirrhosis of the liver and ascites is very weak, can the attacking method be used for treatment? They raised this new question in the research. According to the experience of some traditional Chinese medicine doctors and the records of classical traditional Chinese medicine theory, most advocated the treatment method of "more tonifying and less attacking" or "only tonifying and not attacking". However, these doctors were not bound by these experiences and theories, and continued to explore in order to climb the peak of scientific research. After scientific analysis, testing and research, they boldly adopted the treatment method of "great tonification and great attack", and the results proved that the efficacy of this treatment method was very good. The blue veins exposed in the abdomen, the protruding navel, and the mental depression are typical deficiency symptoms, which are considered to be "five absolutes" incurable diseases in classical literature. But today, in the era of socialist leap forward, a patient who was in such a critical condition was saved. The drug was effective, the abdominal circumference disappeared by more than 20 centimeters, and the mental appetite was significantly improved. Isn't this the greatest good news for the patient? The close integration of Chinese and Western medicine not only expanded the scope of treatment and enriched the treatment experience of traditional Chinese medicine, but also developed the conclusions recorded in past classical medical literature.

    After they completed the academic paper "Clinical Summary and Treatment Rules of Using Attacking Water Method to Treat Liver Cirrhosis Ascites," Dr. Lü Weibai said with great emotion: "The process of learning traditional Chinese medicine and conducting scientific research is also a very good education for every doctor, and a deeper understanding of the greatness of the Chinese medicine policy proposed by the Party!" Some old traditional Chinese medicine doctors also said excitedly about this scientific research work: "The laws of Chinese and Western medicine, summarized in this way with modern scientific methods, can explain the scientific principles of traditional Chinese medicine. Chinese and Western medicine should be closely integrated, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, in order to better promote our great medicine and benefit mankind."

    中西医合作探“宝库”
    本报记者　刘佩珩
    一天下午，在中医研究院附属医院内科病房里，我遇到林业工人梁广业，他带着喜悦的笑脸，把上衣往前提了一提，告诉我说：“现在你看不出我像腹水病人吧！过去腹水胀着肚子，连这样宽大的衣服扣子都扣不上，真得感谢党和毛主席，感谢他教导的好医生给了我新生。”这时，在场的吕维柏大夫兴致勃勃地接着介绍了这个病人医治的情况。这个病人患肝硬变腹水九个月后才来医院，当时皮肤发黑，肚子胀的很大，检查时肝脾都摸不到。经过肝硬变研究小组用以攻为主的攻补兼施疗法，并以中医治疗为主，加上西医的辅助治疗，仅半个多月的时间，腹水就减少了很多。腹围减少十七公分，接近正常人的尺寸。到目前已经有八个月没有复发了。
    这是这个医院内科中西医共同开展中医科学研究给肝硬变腹水患者带来的福音。
    人们对肝硬变腹水并不陌生，它是一种十分顽固的疑难重症，中医称为“单腹胀”或“臌症”。这种病是肝脏丧失了代偿能力，腹水越聚越多，腹部越来越大，以致使肝脏功能渐趋衰竭。多少年来，不知有多少人因患这种病而丧失了劳动能力，甚至断送了生命！中医研究院附属医院内科中西医师，把这种疾病列入今年科学研究的重点项目中，用现代医学科学的方法找出中医独特的疗法—“攻水法”治疗肝硬变腹水的规律。
    “要探索祖国医学宝库的‘秘密’。攻下医学上这个堡垒”，老中医黄坚白和学习过中医的西医吕维柏、俞荣青、施奠邦等都抱定了这样的决心。他们共同组成的肝硬变研究小组，决定采用现代医学科学方法整理研究中医这个疗法。当他们在中医杂志上发现了天津医学院附属医院用中药“臌症丸”治疗肝硬变腹水有效时，立即派大夫去“采风”。
  “臌症丸”中的主要药物是“甘遂”，而且是用“生甘遂”，药量比一般用量增加三倍，这样药性更强了，病人服下后有呕吐、恶心等较强烈的反应。怎样进一步了解“甘遂”的药性，以减少病人服下后的痛苦反应，这是肝硬变研究小组首先探索的问题。他们守在图书室里不知翻阅过多少有关中医古典文献，来寻找理论根据。果然，东汉时伟大的医学家张仲景在一千多年前著的“金匮要略”、“伤寒论”中有过记载，以
  “甘遂”为主药的“十枣汤”就是有名的“攻水方”。这使他们进一步明确了“攻水”法是中医独特的疗法。
    在一次讨论会上，富有“攻法”治疗经验的中医黄坚白大夫，介绍了对“甘遂”药性的认识。他说：“以‘甘遂’为主剂的攻方，凡是煎成汤剂的都比丸、粉剂的药力弱效果小。”这个实际经验和中药研究所协助他们作的动物试验所得的结果完全一致。试验结果也是“甘遂”有效成分溶解于酒精而不溶解于水。这些都使他们更加明确了“臌症丸”或“甘遂”治剂多为丸剂和粉剂的科学依据。“原来中医治疗时用的剂型，都有科学根据啊！”一些西医们对中医医学有了进一步的认识，中医也从这次研究中第一次了解治疗时用丸剂、粉剂的科学道理。
    正当他们在探讨药物的反应时，吕维柏大夫建议用“肠溶衣”把药丸裹在里边，使病人服的药在胃里不溶解，胃粘膜不受药物刺激，让药到肠里时再溶解，来避免或减轻病人的反应。接着，俞荣青、施奠邦、周建中等大夫和放射科的大夫唐凌云合作，亲身作人体试验。在一个星期天的清晨，他们把用钡剂作成的丸药，裹在“肠溶衣”里服下，然后静静地躺在床上，每隔一定的时间唐凌云大夫就为他们透视观察，找出“肠溶衣”包裹的药物在胃里停留约半小时到一小时后到肠中的规律。在试验室里，药房的工作人员把“臌症丸”裹起不同层数的“肠溶衣”，从细致的科学观察和分析中也得到一些科学的规律。
    大夫们这样夜以继日不知疲劳地研究，终于在临床上看到了效果。患者刘振山是医院里的老病号，住院有一年多。过去曾服“舟车丸”等攻剂七十五次，每次嗅到药物就呕吐不止，病人痛苦的噙着眼泪咽下药，而腹水量消失却很少。这次他顺利的服下了用“肠溶衣”包着的“臌症丸”，反应轻微，泻水量却很多，有时一次就泻下二千多毫升，仅半个多月的时间，腹围就从一百一十二公分降到九十三点五公分。病人笑逐颜开，其他病人服用改进后的“臌症丸”也逐渐取得同样良好的疗效。
    中西医密切结合，用现代科学方法研究中医这种疗法所取得胜利的过程，使他们更进一步了解了党的中医政策的正确性。老中医黄坚白过去对西医治疗是抱着怀疑态度的，总觉得西医在治疗上没有什么可取的地方，只是中医“神通广大”办法多。从三年前他和西医共同研究了血吸虫病肝硬变腹水，加上这次结合临床的研究，才逐渐使他消除了脑中的问题。当他回想起自己行医多年亲眼看见多少病人服用攻药时产生呕吐等反应的痛苦情景，当时也想为病人解除这个痛苦，却一直找不出门路。现在用“肠溶衣”包裹起丸药，经过西医的科学研究，减轻或消除病人服药的痛苦反应，扩大了病人治疗的范围，而且对中医治疗也研究出一些科学依据。这些事实不仅使中医进一步认识了科学，更深深地体会出党提出用现代科学方法整理研究中医这个方针的正确性。参加研究工作的西医们也深刻地认识到祖国医学真是伟大的宝库，更加鼓舞起他们探索这个宝库的信心，决心继续配合中医进一步展开研究活动。那时，几个年青大夫们在一起几乎每天都交谈：腹水有随长随消的可能，是否可以采取连续攻的办法？他们还没有来得及和黄坚白大夫商量，黄老大夫却来找他们，也正是谈这个问题。他根据多年临床的经验，也想试用连续攻法。新的研究课题确定下来了。他们的研究活动也频繁了。吕维柏大夫在翻阅内科学等著作中发现了过去不曾重视的西药泻剂——硫酸镁。他回忆起过去在临床治疗上，观察病人服这种药物除泻水量少外，最大优点是病人没有痛苦，因此在用改进后的“臌症丸”连续攻时，也交替服一部分这种西药，同时，中医还兼用补法，有时多攻少补，有时多补少攻，一般患者经过半个多月的治疗，腹水就减少或接近消失。患者李孟勋，今年3月入院经五次攻水，腹围从九十三公分消减到正常腹围七十六公分，经化验检查，肝功能显著好转，国庆节后就出院了。
    肝硬变腹水病人如果身体非常虚弱，能不能用攻法治疗呢？他们在研究中又提出这个新题课。按照一些中医的经验和中医古典理论的记载，多主张“多补少攻”或“只补不攻”的疗法。而这些大夫们却没有受这些经验和理论所束缚，为了攀登科学研究的高峰，继续进行了探索。他们经过科学的分析、化验和研究，大胆地采用了“大补大攻”的治法，结果证明这样治法的疗效很好。腹胀的青筋暴露，肚脐突出，精神萎靡等重症是典型的虚症，在古典文献认为这是属于“五绝”不治之症。但是今天，在社会主义跃进的时代里，一位这样危急的奄奄一息的病人得救了，服药后收效显著，腹围消失二十多公分，精神食欲明显好转，对病人来说这能说不是一件最大的喜讯吗？中西医密切结合，不仅在治疗范围上扩大了，丰富了中医治疗经验，更重要的是发展了过去古典医学文献中记载的论断。
    当他们完成“用攻水法治疗肝硬变腹水的临床总结和治疗规律”的学术论文后，吕维柏大夫颇有所感的这样说：“学习中医和进行科学研究的过程，对每个医生来讲也是一次很好的教育，更深刻了解党提出的中医政策的伟大！”有的老中医谈起这次科学研究工作也兴奋地说：“中西医的规律，用现代科学方法这样一总结可讲清了中医的科学道理。中西医要密切结合，互相取长补短，才能更好地发扬光大我国伟大的医学，为人类造福。”（附图片）
