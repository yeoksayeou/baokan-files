　　Yellowflower

　　Yellowflower is also known as Pulsatilla chinensis. It grows on field ridges, fallow land, rice paddy fields, soybean fields, wheat fields, vegetable gardens, and other places. Yellowflower grows relatively sparsely. When utilizing it, chop the Yellowflower into pieces and boil it before feeding it to pigs. If you use 70% to 80% Yellowflower and mix it with 20% to 30% rice bran, the effect of feeding pigs will be even better. It is estimated that each pig weighing twenty-five jin can gain three hundred and twelve grams (0.62 market jin) per day. (Image attached)

　　黄曲
    黄曲又名白头翁。生长在田埂边、休闲地、水稻田坪和豆田、麦园、菜园等地。黄曲生长较分散，利用时，将黄曲切碎煮熟后就可喂猪，如用70％至80％的黄曲，掺入20％至30％的米糠，喂猪效果更好，估计二十五斤重的猪每头每天可增重三百一十二克（零点六二市斤）。（附图片）
