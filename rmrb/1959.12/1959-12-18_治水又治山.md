    Controlling Water and Transforming Mountains
  　Shi Erwu
    I read in the Henan Daily that the "poor mountains and wicked waters" of Wangwu Mountain have been transformed into a rich and beautiful land. The Wangwu Commune members have a few songs: "Wangwu becomes continuous mountains, endless good news, controlling mountains and controlling water, slopes changed to terraced fields, mountaintops greened with forests, canals winding around the mountains, fearing neither drought nor flood, bumper harvests every year. The commune's power is great, relying on the Party, not on Heaven." (December 12, Henan Daily) This sings out the common joy of the people of the whole country.
    Speaking of Wangwu Mountain, its reputation for being "harmful" has long been known. In the story of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved Mountains, he wanted to move the Taihang and Wangwu Mountains. The Foolish Old Man of legend was a very ambitious man; he had the idea of "man will conquer nature" at that time, determined to level these two mountains blocking the way. The spirit of the Foolish Old Man is precisely the essence of our national spirit. For thousands of years, our working people have continuously inherited and carried forward this spirit. Chairman Mao once used the "Foolish Old Man" spirit to teach the whole Party, calling on the whole Party and the people of the whole country to carry forward this spirit and dig away the two mountains of imperialism and feudalism that were weighing down on the Chinese people. It is precisely in accordance with the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao that we have dug away those two mountains.
    Now, we have two more mountains in front of us: one is called the Poor Mountain, and the other is called the Blank Mountain. The spirit of the Foolish Old Man has also been given a higher expression among our people. That is: no longer moving, but governing. The "transformation" of Wangwu Mountain is precisely the result of the Wangwu Commune people's "governance." It is the same mountain, but whether it can be transformed from "harm" to "benefit" and from poverty to wealth depends entirely on whether people govern it or not. The people of Wangwu Commune not only have the ambition to "control mountains and control water" but also have the methods to control mountains and control water, digging channels, building water cellars, digging mountain springs, digging wells, digging fish-scale pits on one hand, and building reservoirs, building river dams, building valley weirs, damming ditches to silt land, building land dikes, making contour lines, planting trees and creating forests, and closing mountains for afforestation on the other. Digging and building, for three years, the mountains and rivers have greatly changed.
    The people of the whole country are also using the spirit of "controlling mountains and controlling water" to govern the poor mountains and blank mountains. All trades and industries are constantly striving to dig, not only to dig away all "harmful mountains" and "wicked waters" and right-leaning stagnation, but also to dig out all sources and all potentials; and are constantly building, building golden, glittering spiritual mansions, building rich and beautiful paradises. Taking only water conservancy construction as an example, the scale is larger than in the past, the momentum is more magnificent than in the past, the ideas are more ingenious than in the past, and the work efficiency is higher than in the past. And our motherland's great rivers and mountains are becoming richer and more beautiful day by day. Only a liberated people can become the masters of nature, can constantly beautify nature, beautify the earth, and beautify the universe. The Chinese people, as skilled craftsmen repairing the earth, as engineers building the spiritual mansions of mankind, are truly worthy of the name!
    "Repairing the Earth," what a great spirit, it also reflects the dramatic change in the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people from moving to governing. The spirit of the Foolish Old Man's "man will conquer nature" is valuable. But the "man" in it has its own characteristics of the times. The people at that time were individual households, so the Foolish Old Man only relied on "the son begets the grandson, the grandson begets the son; the son also has sons, and the son also has grandsons." Although it was passed down from generation to generation, the momentum, strength, and spirit were still not big enough, not enough to make him establish the ideal of fundamentally controlling the mountains and rivers, so the end of the story could only be attributed to the gods moving the mountains away. And we are all people under the people's commune system, so we immediately think of "the commune's power is great, relying on the Party, not on Heaven." What we think of when we encounter problems is large-scale mass movements, is thousands of troops and horses. What we think of is not just moving back and forth, but fundamentally transforming and governing the mountains and rivers. This kind of ambition, this kind of style, this kind of grandeur, this kind of strength, is unprecedented. The communist style of the Chinese people that we often talk about is nothing else but the style of more than six hundred million people who have fully liberated their minds, established communist ambitions, and have the people's commune as their backing, thus having infinite power. If people can be named according to the times, then the Foolish Old Man, if he knew, would also sincerely admire the heroic name of "Commune Man"!

    治水又治山
  　施尔武
    在河南日报上看到，“穷山恶水”的王屋山变成了富饶美丽之乡。王屋公社的社员们有几句歌：“王屋变连山，喜事说不完，治山又治水，坡地改梯田，山顶绿林化，水渠盘山转，旱涝都不怕，年年大丰产。公社力量大，靠党不靠天。”（12月12日河南日报）唱出的是全国人民的共同欢乐。
    提起王屋山，是“害”名久传的了。当年愚公移山，要移的就是太行王屋二山。传说中的愚公，是一个很有志气的人，他那时就有了“人定胜山”的思想，决心挖平这两座拦路大山。愚公精神，正是我们民族精神的精华。几千年来，我们劳动人民不断继承和发扬光大这种精神。毛主席曾经用“愚公精神”教导全党，号召全党和全国人民发扬这种精神，挖掉压在中国人民头上的帝国主义和封建主义的两座大山。我们正是遵照党和毛主席的教导，把那两座大山挖掉了。
    如今，我们面前还有两座大山：一个叫穷山，一个叫白山。愚公精神也在我们人民中有了更高的发扬。这就是：不再是移，而是要治。王屋山的“变”，正是王屋公社人民“治”的结果。同是一山，能不能由“害”变“利”、由穷变富，全在乎人治还是不治。王屋公社的人既有“治山治水”之志，又有治山治水之法，一面挖渠道，打水窖，挖山泉，打水井，挖鱼鳞坑……；一面建水库，筑河坝，修谷坊，闸沟淤地，垒地堰，作水平线，植树造林，封山育林。挖挖、建建，三年下来，山河大变。
    全国人民也正在用“治山治水”的精神治理着穷山白山。行行业业，都在不断努力地挖，既要挖掉一切“害山”“恶水”和右倾暮气，又要挖出一切源流，一切潜力；也在不断地建，建起金光闪闪的精神大厦，建起富饶美丽的乐园来。仅拿水利建设一项来说，规模比过去更大，气势比过去更宏，心思比过去更巧，工效比过去更高。而我们祖国的伟大河山，也就一天天变得更富饶更美丽。只有像解放了的人民，才能成为自然的主人，才能不断美化自然，美化地球，美化宇宙。中国人民作为一个修理地球的巧手艺匠，作为一个建造人类精神大厦的工程师真是当之无愧的啊！
    “修理地球”，这是何等伟大的气概，它也正好反映了中国人民从移到治之间在精神面貌上的剧变。愚公的“人定胜山”的精神是可贵的。但其中的“人”，是有他的时代特征的。那时的人，是独家独户的人，所以愚公依靠的只是“子又生孙，孙又生子；子又有子，子又有孙”尽管世代相传，但那声势力量气魄毕竟还不够大，还不足以使他树立根治山河的理想，所以故事的最后只能归结为由神来把山移走。而我们都是人民公社制度下的人，因此一想便想到了“公社力量大，靠党不靠天”。我们遇事想到的是大规模群众运动，是千军万马。我们想的不只是移来移去，而是根本改造和治理山河。这种心志之大，风格之高，气魄之雄，力量之厚，都是前无古人的。我们常常说到的中国人民的共产主义风格，不是别的，正是六亿多充分解放了思想，树立了共产主义的雄心大志，又有人民公社作依仗因而力大无穷的人的风格。倘使人能因时代而名，那末，愚公有知，也会从心底羡慕“公社人”这个豪迈的名字的！
