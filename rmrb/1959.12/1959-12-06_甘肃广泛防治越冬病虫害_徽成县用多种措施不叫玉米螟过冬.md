Gansu Widely Prevents and Controls Overwintering Diseases and Pests
Huicheng County Uses Multiple Measures to Prevent Corn Borers from Overwintering

(Our report) The broad rural areas of Gansu Province, while engaging in water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, have widely launched work to prevent and control overwintering diseases and insect pests, aiming to eradicate crop diseases and insect pests and ensure the continued leap forward in agriculture next year.

This year, Gansu Province's prevention and control of overwintering diseases and insect pests implemented the policy of "early prevention, small prevention, thorough prevention, and good prevention," grasping it early and grasping it well. In the winter wheat areas, a series of preventive measures were taken before sowing. Various localities selected improved varieties with strong resistance to rust and red blight, such as "Zhongsu No. 68" and "Qianjiao Wheat," and the area of seed treatment with pesticides such as Ceresan reached more than 9.6 million mu, accounting for more than 90% of the total sown area. Ning County, Qingyang, Jingchuan and other counties also carried out soil disinfection with pesticides, reaching 860,000 mu. Therefore, this year's winter wheat generally grows lush and strong. However, due to the higher ground temperature and timely rainfall since the beginning of autumn compared to previous years, the occurrence of wheat rust and red blight was promoted. People's communes in various localities, holding high the glorious banner of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, gave full play to the superiority of the communes, divided areas for contracting, divided lines for combat, and organized joint prevention. Jingchuan, Pingliang City, Zhenyuan, Huicheng, and Tianshui City alone mobilized more than 150,000 people to prevent and control for twenty days, preventing and controlling rust in an area of approximately 2.5 million mu and red blight in an area of more than 751,000 mu, including aerial control of more than 51,000 mu, basically controlling the spread of diseases and insect pests. Currently, this work is still developing in depth.

Gansu also carried out encirclement and suppression of other crop diseases and insect pests. Huicheng County focused on the prevention and control of corn borers and rice borers. The county adopted three methods—compression, grinding, and burning—to treat 130 million jin of corn cobs and stalks, and used irrigation, plowing, and picking up rice stubble to prevent and control rice borers in more than 9,300 mu. Zhangye Prefecture and other spring wheat areas in Lanzhou City have also begun to actively allocate medicines and equipment, repair equipment, and carry out spring wheat seed treatment and prevention and control of wheat plant bugs and other diseases and insect pests.

In the vigorous effort to prevent and control overwintering diseases and insect pests, all counties and communes have strengthened the leadership of the Party, with secretaries taking the lead, vigorously launching mass movements, thereby making the work progress quickly and with good quality. Jingchuan County, which achieved a major victory in large-scale rust prevention last year, held three telephone conferences this year, mobilizing the masses at all levels and forming inspection groups, shock teams, and acceptance groups, with agricultural technicians providing guidance, to fully carry out prevention and control work. This county adopted a combination of indigenous pesticides and chemical pesticides, a combination of seed treatment, soil disinfection, and ground control, and a combination of manual encirclement and suppression and aerial control in its prevention and control measures, thus achieving great results.

In order to prevent and eliminate winter wheat rust and ensure increased wheat production next year, the Gansu Provincial Department of Agriculture recently issued an emergency notice on "Continuing to Fight and Eliminate Winter Wheat Rust," requiring all winter wheat areas to make persistent efforts and advance victoriously.

### 甘肃广泛防治越冬病虫害  徽成县用多种措施不叫玉米螟过冬

    甘肃广泛防治越冬病虫害
    徽成县用多种措施不叫玉米螟过冬
    本报讯　甘肃省广大农村，在兴修水利、积肥的同时，广泛开展了防治越冬病虫害工作，要农作物病虫害断子绝孙，保证明年农业继续跃进。
    今年甘肃省防治越冬病虫害，贯彻了“防早、防小、防了、防好”的方针，抓得早，抓得好。冬麦地区在播种前，就做了一系列预防工作，各地选用了抗锈、抗红病能力强的“中苏六十八号”、“钱交麦”等良种，用赛力散等农药拌种的面积达到九百六十多万亩，占播种总面积的90％以上。宁县、庆阳、泾川等县还用农药进行了土壤消毒达八十六万亩。因而，今年冬麦一般长得油绿茁壮。但由于入秋以来地温较往年高，雨水适时，助长了小麦锈病、红病发生。各地人民公社高举总路线、大跃进的光荣旗帜，充分发挥公社的优越性，划片包干，分线作战，组织联防。仅泾川、平凉市、镇原、徽成、天水市等就动员了十五万多人，防治了二十天，预防和防治锈病面积二百五十万亩左右、红病面积七十五万一千多亩，其中飞机防治五万一千多亩，基本控制了病虫害蔓延。目前，这一工作还正在向纵深发展。
    甘肃各地对其他作物病虫害也进行了围歼。徽成县大抓玉米螟、稻螟防治工作，全县采用压、磨、烧三种方法，处理玉米穗轴、茎秆一亿三千万斤，并以灌水、耕翻、拾稻槎等办法防治稻螟九千三百多亩。张掖专区各县和兰州市等春麦地区，也开始积极调药械、整修器具，进行春麦拌种和防治麦椿象等病虫害。
    在大搞越冬病虫防治中，各县、公社都加强了党的领导，书记挂帅，大搞群众运动，因而使工作进展快、质量好。去年获得大面积防治锈病胜利的泾川县，今年连续召开了三次电话会议，层层发动群众，组成检查组、突击组、验收组，由农业技术干部作指导，全面展开防治工作。这个县在防治措施上，采用了土农药和化学农药相结合，拌种、土壤消毒和地面防治相结合，人工围剿和飞机防治相结合的办法，因此收效很大。
    为了防治和消灭冬小麦锈病，保证明年小麦增产，最近甘肃省农业厅发出“关于继续奋战扑灭冬小麦锈病”的紧急通知，要求各冬麦地区再接再厉，乘胜前进。
