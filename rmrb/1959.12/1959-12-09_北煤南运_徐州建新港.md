North Coal South Transportation
Xuzhou Builds New Port
(Our report) To alleviate the heavy railway transportation tasks, a new line of the Grand Canal from south of Weishan Lake is being excavated, passing through the Xuzhou coal mining area eastward to Pixian County to connect with the old line of the canal. Two modern coal ports, Xuzhou Coal Port and Shuanglou Coal Port, are being built in Xuzhou.
　　At these two coal ports, branch lines are being laid from the Jinpu and Longhai railways into the port, so that coal trains can directly access the docks. Coal is automatically unloaded by car dumpers and loading machines load the coal into the ship's hold. Ships with a deadweight of 3,000 tons can be docked. All loading and unloading is mechanized.
　　After the coal ports are completed, in addition to handling the outward transport of Xuzhou coal, coal transported south from Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan and other places will also be transferred via Xuzhou by waterway to Shanghai and other places.

    北煤南运
    徐州建新港
    本报讯　为了分担繁重的铁路运输任务，京杭大运河从微山湖以南开挖新线，经徐州煤矿区往东至邳县与运河老线接通，并在徐州兴建两座现代化煤港——徐州煤港和双楼煤港。
    这两座煤港从津浦、陇海铁路铺支线到港内，装煤火车直接开到码头，由翻车机自动卸煤、装煤机把煤装入船舱、能停靠载重三千吨的轮船，全部装卸机械化。
    煤港建成后，除担负徐州煤炭外运外，山东、河北、山西、河南等地南运煤炭，也由徐州转水路运往上海等地。
