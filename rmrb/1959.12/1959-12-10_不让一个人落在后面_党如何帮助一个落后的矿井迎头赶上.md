    Not Letting Anyone Fall Behind
    —How the Party Helped a Backward Mine Catch Up
    By Ku Yoen, First Secretary of the Party Committee of the Mansfeld "Wilhelm Pieck" Smelting Combine and Mansfeld Mining Enterprise, German Democratic Republic

    Since the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, especially in welcoming the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the working people of the Mansfeld mines and smelters have made great achievements. The "Wilhelm Pieck" Smelting Combine had completed 80% of its annual plan by September 30th, the "Progress" mine completed 81.9%, and the "Thälmann" mine completed 76.7%.

    It is no coincidence that these enterprises are also at the forefront of carrying out socialist collective work. More than one-third of the employees in the Mansfeld smelters and mines have been involved in this movement. In the most important production areas, most work teams are striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." At the same time, many workers and intellectuals have formed socialist work collectives and started to solve important scientific and technological problems.

    Pioneer Falls Behind

    Despite these outstanding examples, there are also some enterprises and production departments here that have slowed down the overall speed of development on the seven-year plan track. For example, the Otto Brosowski mine, which for a long time played a pioneering role in the development speed of the entire industrial sector, has now begun to fall behind.

    The Party committee's working group revealed the reasons for the mine's continuous regression in completing the plan: the mine leadership had serious shortcomings in scientific and technological and mining work; some leading comrades adopted an opportunist attitude towards the Party's general line, such as former mine director Pegant and former mining director Eltel; the mine Party committee retreated in front of these leaders' views; and the view that "the plan is too high" spread pessimism.

    How did the Party committee help the comrades of the Otto Brosowski mine?

    Socialist Assistance

    The Party committee office decided to send outstanding workers, pit leaders, and leading cadres from other mines to give the Brosowski mine socialist assistance. This was the turning point.

    At two general membership meetings, the pessimism that had infiltrated the Party organization was shattered, and the opportunist attitudes of some comrades were criticized. For example, former mining director Eltel arrogantly said that he had been a miner for many years, so he did not need to learn any experience from other mines. What kind of Party member is it to kick aside the Party's resolution on scientific and technological progress and the significance of experience exchange?

    The conference also decided to adjust the Party groups. The Party organization of the Brosowski mine is a reputable and strong Party organization. Excellent Party members were sent to departments with fewer Party members. While explaining the overall task, each Party member was assigned a specific task. The Party organization summarized every day; Party members reported on their completion of the Party's entrustment, and those who fell behind were criticized. Through this concrete leadership and supervision, most Party members began to take the lead in the struggle to overcome shortcomings.

    While launching ideological criticism within the Party organization, we also sent outstanding work team leaders and foremen from other mines with rich experience in socialist collective work to the key points of the Brosowski mine. Through their outstanding performance there, they proved that it was not that the plan was too high, but that the leadership method was improper and technical and scientific progress was neglected. At the same time, the work team leaders and foremen of the Brosowski mine also went to the excellent work teams of other mines to learn, and soon returned to their own work teams to quickly promote the experience they had learned.

    In both cases, the life of initial skepticism was not long. The help and feeling were so strong that, with the achievement of success, more and more work teams overcame the mistake of distrusting their own strength, and more and more work teams and sections resolutely and optimistically threw themselves into the battle to complete the plan.

    At the same time, outstanding leading cadres such as Comrade Glebovsky ("Labor Hero," director of the Niederlübblingen mine) and Comrade Erich ("Labor Hero," mining director of the Thälmann mine) were also sent to be responsible for leading the important production departments of the Brosowski mine. They used practical examples to show the responsible foremen and chief foremen there how to manage and lead production departments in a socialist way.

    Like the mines, workshops and management departments on the ground also sent out excellent cadres. Experienced cadres were provided to the leaders of the Party organizations and mass organizations in order to also use the best leadership methods there. The most effective methods of the Party's mass work were quickly introduced to the Brosowski mine through the most outstanding forces.

    The external assistance organized under the leadership of the Party soon led to obvious progress. The consciousness of the mine's working people has been improved. Through our persuasion work and practical struggle experience, the miners are convinced that the plan can and must be completed. In this way, socialist assistance between workshops and work teams has gradually developed in the enterprise. Among the thirty-five work teams directly participating in production labor, thirty are now striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team."

    Comrade Flitzer of the Heidike work team said: "Our Heidike work team has always completed the plan well, but it is not right for other work teams to fall behind." Regardless of remuneration, he participated in the Balvi work team, which only completed 80% to 90% of the plan on average, to help it, so that it also became an advanced team. Soon after, this work team also reached the planned target. Comrade Flitzer also helped three other work teams in a few weeks. With the help of Captain Zimmloth of the "Thälmann" mine, the Liter work team has developed from a backward team to an advanced team. There are many similar examples.

    Thanks to fraternal assistance and socialist collective work, output has begun to grow again. In July, the copper production plan was completed by 70%, and in August it had reached 80%. At the end of August and the beginning of September, the mine began to complete its plan again.

    Through strict daily supervision of the implementation of the Party's resolutions, criticism of wrong views, and regular exchange of experience, the workers' trust in the Party has been greatly consolidated. In a short period of time, many workers applied to join the Party, precisely in those most difficult areas.

    Strength Lies in Collective Work

    What experiences have we gained? What conclusions have we drawn?

      (1) Practice has clearly proved that the speed of realizing the seven-year plan on the road to socialist victory mainly lies in socialist collective work.
      (2) Through socialist collective work, the fraternal unity of the working class has been unprecedentedly developed, and the alliance between the working class and the intellectuals has been consolidated.
      (3) Through the continuous help of the advanced to the backward, the main shortcomings in mass work, that is, only working for a part of the working class instead of the entire working class, have been overcome.
      (4) Workers, technicians, and engineers participating in socialist collective work are the main force in overcoming old habits and backwardness under the leadership of the Party.
      (5) The comprehensive external assistance provided to the Brosowski mine teaches us that we must fight practically, centrally, and purposefully for the implementation of new things and the overcoming of old things in key areas.

    This work has prompted our Party committee office to decide to carry out organized experience exchange not only in the economic field but also in the political field. Now the leaders of the Party and trade unions often hold meetings with the leaders of some enterprises. The two leaders regularly report their experience to the Party committee office. Workshop branches and similar production departments in various enterprises are also doing so. This helps us to more resolutely and quickly eliminate the situation where the development speed of similar enterprises or certain production departments is different for a long time and excellent working methods cannot be promoted.

    We are also resolutely overcoming the phenomenon of underestimating the significance of systematically working with many outstanding activists and innovators. The army of activists, innovators, rationalization proposers, and national title winners (of which there are thousands in the Mansfeld industrial sector) is a reserve cadre team for transporting leaders and backbones in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life.

    Another lesson is that even if the overall performance of a workshop or enterprise is good, we should not ignore the fact that more work teams or working people in these workshops or enterprises have not completed their plans. Originally, the Party committee office should have taken measures for the Brosowski mine earlier, but the good overall performance of the industrial sector blinded our vision.

    In the future, we should not only pay attention to socialist assistance outside the enterprise when some enterprises fall behind, but should also continuously promote the good experience of the most outstanding work teams and sections and implement them through practical assistance.

    不让一个人落在后面
    ——党如何帮助一个落后的矿井迎头赶上
    德意志民主共和国曼斯费尔德“威廉·皮克”冶炼
    联合企业和曼斯费尔德采矿企业党委第一书记  库·约恩
    自从德国统一社会党第五次代表大会以来，特别是在迎接德意志民主共和国成立十周年的时候，曼斯费尔德矿井和冶炼厂的劳动人民取得了巨大的成就。“威廉·皮克”冶炼联合企业到9月30日就已完成了全年计划的80％，“进步”矿井完成了81.9％，“台尔曼”矿井完成了76.7％。
    这些企业在开展社会主义集体工作方面也走在前面，这并不是偶然的。曼斯费尔德各冶炼厂和矿井有三分之一以上的职工已被卷入这个运动中。在最重要的生产地段，多数工作队都在争取“社会主义劳动队”的称号。同时有许多工人和知识分子组成了社会主义工作集体，着手解决重要的科学技术问题。
    开路先锋落后了
    尽管有着这些杰出的范例，在我们这里也有一些企业和生产部门，减缓了在七年计划轨道上向前发展的总速度。例如奥托·布洛索夫斯基矿井有很长一段时期，在整个工业部门发展速度方面起了开路先锋的作用，可是，现在它已开始落在后面了。
    党委工作组揭发了这个矿井在完成计划方面不断倒退的原因：矿井领导在科学技术和采矿工作中存在着严重的缺点；某些领导同志对党的总路线采取了机会主义的态度，例如前任矿长配冈特和前任矿务主任埃尔特尔就是这样；矿井党委在这些领导同志的观点前退缩；“计划太高了”的观点传播了悲观主义。
    党委是怎样对奥托·布洛索夫斯基矿井的同志进行帮助的呢？
    社会主义式的帮助
    党委办公室决定调派其他矿井的优秀工人、坑长和领导干部来给予布洛索夫斯基矿井以社会主义式的帮助。这是转折的起点。
    在两次全体党员大会上粉碎了渗入到党组织内来的悲观主义，批判了一些同志的机会主义态度。例如，前任矿务主任埃尔特尔曾自高自大地说，他当过多年矿工，因此就用不着学习其他矿井的什么经验了。把党关于科学技术进步的决议、经验交流的意义一脚踢开，这算是一个什么党员？
    大会同时决定调整党小组。布洛索夫斯基矿井的党组织是一个声誉卓著的坚强的党组织。优秀党员被派遣到党员不多的部门中去。在交代总任务的同时，每个党员都分配到具体的任务。党组织每天都进行总结；党员们汇报自己完成党的委托的情况，落后的就受到批评。通过这种具体的领导和监督，多数党员在争取克服缺点的斗争中开始起带头作用。
    在党组织内展开思想批判的同时，我们还把在社会主义集体工作方面经验丰富的其他矿井的杰出的工作队长和工长派到布洛索夫斯基矿井的重点上去。他们通过他们的杰出表现在那儿证明了，并不是计划太高了，而是领导方法不当和技术科学进步受到忽视。同时布洛索夫斯基矿井的工作队长和工长也到其他矿的优秀工作队去学习，过了不久就回到自己的工作队去，迅速地推广他们所学习到的经验。
    在这两种情况下，开始时的怀疑思想的寿命并不长，帮助和感受是如此的强烈，以致随着成就的取得，越来越多的工作队克服了不信任自己力量的错误，越来越多的工作队和工段坚决地乐观地投入了争取完成计划的战斗。
    同时，像“劳动英雄”、国家奖金获得者格莱布勃夫斯基同志（尼德吕布林根矿井主任）和“劳动英雄”、台尔曼矿井矿务主任艾利希特同志这样杰出的领导干部，也被派去负责领导布洛索夫斯基矿井的重要生产部门，他们用实际的例子向那儿的负责工长和总工长表明，怎样以社会主义方式来管理和领导生产部门。
    同各矿井一样，地面上的车间和管理部门也都派出了优秀的干部。向党组织和群众组织的领导提供富有经验的干部，为的是也在那儿运用最好的领导工作方法。党的群众工作的最有效的方法，通过最优秀的力量，迅速地介绍到布洛索夫斯基矿井上去。
    在党的领导下组织的企业外的帮助，不久就导致了明显的进步。矿井劳动人民的自觉性提高了。通过我们的说服工作和实际的斗争经验，矿工们确信计划能够并且必须完成。这样，车间对车间，工作队对工作队，社会主义式的帮助在企业里也逐渐发展起来。在直接参加生产劳动的三十五个工作队中，现在有三十个正在争取“社会主义劳动队”的称号。
    海迪克工作队的弗利采同志说：“我们海迪克工作队计划一直完成得不错，而别的工作队落在后面，这是不行的。”他不计报酬，参加了平均只完成计划80％到90％的巴尔维工作队，去帮助它，使它也成为先进的队。不久以后，这个工作队也达到了计划指标。弗利采同志在几星期过程中还帮助了其他三个工作队。在“台尔曼”矿井辛布洛特队长的帮助下，李特工作队从一个落后的队发展成为先进的队。类似的例子还有好多。
    由于兄弟般的帮助和社会主义集体工作，产量又开始增长。7月铜的生产计划完成了70％，8月就已达到80％。8月底、9月初，矿井重又开始完成自己的计划。
    通过每天严格监督党的决议的执行情况、批判错误的观点和定期的经验交流，工人对党的信任大大地巩固了。在短时期内，恰恰是在那些最困难的地段，有许多工人提出了入党的申请。
    力量在于集体工作
    我们获得了哪些经验？我们得出哪些结论？
      （1）实践明确地证明：在向社会主义胜利前进的道路上，实现七年计划的速度主要在于社会主义集体工作。
      （2）通过社会主义集体工作，工人阶级的兄弟团结获得了空前的发展，工人阶级和知识分子的联盟获得了巩固。
      （3）通过先进对落后的不断帮助，克服了群众工作中的主要缺点，即只对一部分而不是对整个工人阶级进行工作。
      （4）参加社会主义集体工作的工人、技术员和工程师，是在党的领导下克服旧习惯和落后的最主要力量。
      （5）向布洛索夫斯基矿井提供的这种全面的企业外的帮助教导我们，必须在重点地段踏实地、集中地和有目的地为贯彻新的事物和克服旧的事物而进行斗争。
    这种工作促使我们党委办公室决定，不仅在经济方面，而且也在政治方面进行有组织的经验交流。现在党和工会的领导经常和某些企业的领导开会。两个领导定期向党委办公室汇报它们的经验。车间支部和各企业的类似生产部门也在这样做。这就帮助我们更坚决更迅速地消除同类企业或某些生产部门在较长时期内发展速度不同和优秀工作方法得不到推广的局面。
    我们也坚决地克服这种现象，即低估对许多杰出的积极分子和革新者进行系统工作的意义。积极分子、革新者、合理化建议者和国家称号获得者的大军（其中曼斯费尔德工业部门有几千名），是输送政治、经济和文化生活各方面的领导人和骨干的干部后备队。
    另外一个教训是：即使车间或企业的总成绩良好，也不要忽视这些车间或企业中有较多的工作队或劳动人民没有完成自己的计划。本来党委办公室是应当更早地对布洛索夫斯基矿井采取措施的，可是工业部门的良好的总成绩蒙蔽了我们的视线。
    将来我们不能仅仅在遇到一些企业落后时才重视企业外的社会主义帮助，而且应当不断地推广最优秀的工作队和地段的良好经验，并通过实际帮助来加以贯彻。（附图片）
