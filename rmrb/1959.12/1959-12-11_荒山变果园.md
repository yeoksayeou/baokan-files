    Barren Hills Transformed into Orchards
    As people enter the Liuwang People's Commune in Rong County, Guangxi, they can see orchards everywhere on the hillsides. Some orchard gates are inscribed with: "May Fourth Youth Flower and Fruit Mountain," "March 8th Flower and Fruit Garden," "Liu Hulan Flower and Fruit Garden," "Xiang Xiuli Flower and Fruit Garden"...; some have couplets that read "Four seasons of fine fruit, fragrance of flowers everywhere." To date, the entire commune has planted more than 2,714,000 fruit trees of various kinds, an average of more than 90 trees per person. The orchards are filled with lush green fruit trees everywhere.
    The orchards of the Liuwang Commune have been developed in the last year or two. In the past, only the Liuwang Brigade had fruit trees. After communization, the Commune Party Committee, based on the situation of having more mountains than fields, put forward the call of "vigorously developing fruit trees on the mountains," which immediately received an enthusiastic response from the masses.
    In the process of greening barren hills and building orchards, the commune adopted the method of combining mass movements with specialized production. In less than a year, the entire commune built 62 orchards, covering an area of more than 5,100 mu. The Commune Party Committee plans to plant another 2,560,000 fruit trees of various kinds this winter and next spring.

    荒山变果园
    人们一走进广西容县六王人民公社，就可以看到山坡上到处是果园。有的园门上写着：“五四青年花果山”“三八花果园”“刘胡兰花果园”“向秀丽花果园”……；有的写着“四季有佳果，到处是花香”的对联。到目前为止，全公社已种植各种果树二百七十一万四千多株，平均每人达到九十多株。园内处处是绿油油的果树。
    六王公社的果园，是在最近一两年内发展起来的。过去这个社只有六王大队有果树。公社化后，公社党委根据山多田少的情况，提出了“大搞果树上山”的号召，立即得到了群众的热烈响应。
    在绿化荒山、建造果园当中，由于采取了大搞群众运动和专业生产相结合的办法，不到一年，全社便建成果园六十二处，面积五千一百多亩。公社党委计划在今冬明春再种各种果树二百五十六万株。
