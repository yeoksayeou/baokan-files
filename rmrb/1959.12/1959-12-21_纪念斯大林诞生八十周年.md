　　Commemorating the Eightieth Anniversary of Stalin's Birth
　　Ai Siqi
　　Today is the eightieth anniversary of the birth of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the outstanding figure of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state, the staunch revolutionary of the international communist movement, and the great Marxist-Leninist. From the age of fifteen, when Stalin joined the revolutionary movement, until his death at the age of seventy-four, he dedicated sixty full years to the cause of communism. After Lenin's death, he led the world's first socialist country, the Soviet Union, for thirty years. Today, as we commemorate Stalin, we see that the cause of communism has achieved unprecedented and enormous development, not only in the Soviet Union, but also in China and other socialist countries, and on a global scale.
　　Before the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, communism was merely the scientific prediction of Marxism. In order to realize this most noble ideal of mankind, the immortal Lenin led the advanced elements of the Russian proletariat, including Stalin, in actively disseminating Marxism, combining Marxism with the Russian workers' movement, and developing Marxist groups in various parts of Russia into a new type of proletarian revolutionary party—the Bolshevik Party—that was unified ideologically, politically, and organizationally. It was under the leadership of this party that the Russian proletariat victoriously realized the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat in 1917.
　　The Russian October Revolution opened a new era in human history, transforming socialism and communism from ideals into reality. After crushing the armed intervention of fourteen capitalist countries and completing the task of economic recovery, the Soviet people resolutely implemented Lenin's general line of industrialization of the Soviet state and collectivization of agriculture. The realization of this general line of socialist transformation and socialist construction enabled the Soviet Union to shake off its economically backward state and become an advanced and powerful first socialist country in human history. This brilliant achievement not only attracted the working people of the world, inspiring them to yearn for socialism, but also created the conditions for the Soviet Union to achieve victory in the war against Hitlerite fascism, enabling the Soviet Union to play a decisive role in defeating Hitler. The victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, with the Soviet Union as the main force, and the birth of the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe in this victory, became a major turning point in human history after the October Revolution. After World War II, socialism transcended the boundaries of one country and developed into a world system. The worldwide revolutionary workers' movement and the national liberation movements of oppressed nations also experienced a new upsurge. And the Soviet Union, as the head of the socialist camp, has become more developed and powerful after the war. Now, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people have begun comprehensive communist construction, and in the first year of the magnificent Seven-Year Plan for the rapid development of the national economy, they have already achieved tremendous success. In 1959, the Soviet Union's industrial output will increase thirty-five times compared to 1913. In the past five years, agricultural and animal husbandry production has seen tremendous growth. The success of the Soviet artificial earth satellites and cosmic rockets has begun the great feat of conquering the universe, marking that the Soviet Union has reached the highest peak in the world in the most important areas of science and technology. All these great victories and achievements that the Soviet Union has achieved in the forty-two years since the October Revolution should be attributed to the great Soviet people, and to the collectively of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, which has led them in their glorious struggle and has been tested over a long period of time. Stalin, who once held a leading position in this collective, made significant contributions during his lifetime.
　　After Lenin's death, Stalin, in order to defend Lenin's line, waged serious struggles against the Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and other bourgeois agents—enemies of Marxism-Leninism. In these struggles, he defended and creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism. In his works such as "The Foundations of Leninism" and "Problems of Leninism," Stalin systematically expounded the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism. He defended Lenin's theories on the uneven development of capitalism and the possibility of the initial victory of socialism in one country, and used this theory to encourage the Soviet people's confidence and determination to build socialism. He defended Lenin's theories on party building, the dictatorship of the proletariat, socialist construction, and so on. Based on Lenin's instructions, Stalin proposed the policies and tasks of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and defeated the joint attack on the party's general line by the Trotskyites and the Bukharinite right-wing opportunists. Stalin left behind many works. His last work, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," is an important document exploring socialist political economy. Stalin's creative contributions to Marxist-Leninist theory have had an indelible impact on all socialist countries, on the working class of the world, and on all oppressed nations. Although Stalin's works include individual erroneous viewpoints and formulas, on the whole, his works remain an important legacy in the treasure trove of Marxist-Leninist theory.
　　Stalin, infinitely loyal to the cause of proletarian revolution, was an irreconcilable enemy of imperialism. He made significant contributions to defending the socialist motherland, developing the international communist movement, assisting the liberation of oppressed nations, and fighting for world peace. The working people, oppressed nations, and peace-loving people of the world have received deep sympathy and enormous support from the Soviet Union in their struggles. Since its founding, the Soviet Union has consistently pursued Lenin's foreign policy of peace. In the struggle for lasting peace, Stalin, based on the rich experience of the Soviet Union's long-term struggle against imperialist countries, emphasized the need to maintain a high degree of vigilance against imperialism, to expose the conspiracies of imperialism before the masses of the people, and mobilized the masses to carry out unremitting struggles to defend peace. All peace-loving people remember what Stalin said in February 1951: "If the peoples of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and persist in this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the warmongers are able to ensnare the masses with a web of lies, deceive the masses, and drag the masses into another world war, then war may become inevitable."
　　Stalin made some serious mistakes in the later period of his life. These mistakes are only secondary compared to his great achievements. Now, the serious lessons learned from Stalin's mistakes have become an important asset of the international communist movement, and, like the Soviet Communist Party's series of successful experiences, it plays a positive role and can and should be used to raise the awareness of all communists, thereby preventing the recurrence of such mistakes and promoting the development of the communist cause.
　　Since Stalin's death, the international communist movement has undergone significant development in recent years and has entered a new stage. The meeting of communist and workers' parties held in Moscow in November 1957 not only demonstrated the strong unity of the international communist movement on an unprecedented scale, but, more importantly, this meeting summarized the common laws of proletarian revolution and socialist construction over the past hundred years, especially since the October Revolution. The Moscow Declaration is the most vivid banner for the people of all countries to strive for lasting world peace, the sharpest weapon for the communist and workers' parties of all countries to carry out revolutionary struggles for the final victory of the communist cause, and also the ideological and political foundation of their internationalist solidarity. The imperialists and the Yugoslav modern revisionists, taking advantage of the Soviet Communist Party's criticism of some of Stalin's mistakes, have greatly attacked the communist parties and socialist countries of various countries, and have launched an anti-communist high tide on a global scale. This has nakedly exposed the ugly counter-revolutionary features of the imperialists and the Yugoslav modern revisionists. In a fierce struggle, the imperialists and the Yugoslav modern revisionists' conspiracies to undermine the international communist movement have gone bankrupt. The cause of communism is developing forward with irresistible force. Of course, as long as the enemies of communism exist, they will not stop their sabotage activities for a single day. Therefore, we must be vigilant against the conspiracies of the imperialists and against the modern revisionists who are traitors to communism. We must hold high the great banner of the Moscow Declaration of communist and workers' parties, protect the unity of socialist countries, communist parties of all countries, and the international working class as we protect our eyes, defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and, in the struggle against the forces of war and aggression, make the cause of world peace advance from victory to victory; in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, make the international communist movement advance from victory to victory.

　　纪念斯大林诞生八十周年
　　艾思奇
    今天是苏联共产党和苏联国家的杰出人物、国际共产主义运动的坚强的革命家、伟大的马克思列宁主义者——约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇·斯大林诞生八十周年。斯大林从十五岁参加革命运动到七十四岁逝世，整整六十年献身于共产主义事业。在列宁逝世之后，他曾经领导世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联三十年之久。今天，当纪念斯大林的时候，我们看到：共产主义事业，不但在苏联，而且在中国和其他社会主义国家，在世界范围内，已经取得了空前巨大的发展。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以前，共产主义只不过是马克思主义的科学预见。为了实现这个人类最崇高的理想，不朽的列宁领导了俄国无产阶级的先进分子，包括斯大林在内，积极传播了马克思主义，使马克思主义和俄国工人运动相结合，使俄国各地马克思主义小组发展成为在思想上、政治上和组织上统一的新型的无产阶级革命的政党——布尔什维克党。正是在这个党的领导下，俄国无产阶级在1917年胜利地实现了无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。
    俄国十月革命开辟了人类历史的新时代，使社会主义和共产主义开始从理想变为现实。苏联人民在粉碎了十四个资本主义国家的武装干涉和完成了经济恢复工作以后，就坚决地执行列宁关于苏维埃国家工业化和农业集体化的总路线。这条社会主义改造和社会主义建设的总路线的实现，使苏联摆脱了经济落后的状态而变成先进的强大的人类历史上第一个社会主义国家。这个辉煌的成就，不仅吸引了全世界劳动人民，使他们向往社会主义；并且造成了苏联在反希特勒法西斯的战争中取得胜利的条件，使苏联在打败希特勒的战争中起了决定性的作用。以苏联为主力的世界反法西斯战争的胜利，以及在这个胜利中东欧人民民主国家的诞生，成为十月革命后人类历史的重大的转折点。第二次世界大战以后，社会主义已越出了一国范围并发展成为世界体系。全世界革命的工人运动和被压迫民族解放运动也有了新的高涨。而作为社会主义阵营的首脑的苏联，在战后也更加发展，更加强大了。现在苏联人民在苏联共产党领导之下，已经开始全面的共产主义建设，并且在大踏步发展国民经济的宏伟的七年计划的第一年中，已经取得巨大的成就。1959年苏联工业产值同1913年比较将增加三十五倍。最近五年来农牧业产量有了巨大的增长。苏联人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭的成功，开始了征服宇宙的壮举，标志着苏联在最重要的科学技术方面已经登上了世界的最高峰。苏联在十月革命后四十二年中所获得的这一切伟大的胜利和成就，都应当归功于伟大的苏联人民，归功于领导他们进行光荣的斗争的、久经考验的苏联共产党中央委员会的集体。在这个集体中曾经担任主要领导人的斯大林，在生前作了重大的贡献。
    在列宁逝世以后，斯大林为了维护列宁的路线，同马克思列宁主义的敌人——托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子和其他资产阶级代理人进行了严重的斗争。他在这些斗争中，保卫了并且创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义。斯大林在他的“论列宁主义基础”、“列宁主义的几个问题”等著作中，系统地阐述了马克思列宁主义的基本原理。他捍卫了列宁关于资本主义发展不平衡规律和社会主义可能在一个国家内首先胜利的理论，并且用这个理论鼓舞了苏联人民建设社会主义的信心和决心。他捍卫了列宁的关于党的建设、无产阶级专政、社会主义建设等等方面的理论。斯大林根据列宁的遗训，提出了国家工业化和农业集体化的方针和任务，击破了托洛茨基分子和布哈林右倾机会主义分子对党的总路线的联合进攻。斯大林遗留下不少著作。他的最后著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，是一本探讨社会主义政治经济学的重要文献。斯大林对于马克思列宁主义理论的创造性贡献，对于各个社会主义国家，对于全世界工人阶级和一切被压迫民族，都具有不可磨灭的影响。斯大林的著作中虽然包括个别错误的论点和公式，但是整个说来，他的著作仍然是马克思列宁主义理论宝库中的重要遗产。
    无限忠实于无产阶级革命事业的斯大林，是帝国主义的不可调和的敌人。他对于保卫社会主义祖国，对于发展国际共产主义运动，对于援助被压迫民族的解放，对于维护世界和平的斗争，都作出了重大的贡献。全世界劳动人民、被压迫民族、爱好和平的人们在自己的斗争中得到了来自苏联的深切的同情和巨大的支持。苏联从建国以来一贯执行列宁的和平外交政策。在争取持久和平的斗争中，斯大林根据苏联同帝国主义国家长期斗争的丰富经验，强调必须对帝国主义保持高度的警惕性，强调必须在人民群众面前揭露帝国主义的阴谋，并曾经动员人民群众为保卫和平进行不懈的斗争。一切爱好和平的人们，都记得1951年2月间斯大林所说的一段话：“如果各国人民把维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子得以用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众，欺骗人民群众，把人民群众拖入另一次世界大战中去，那么战争就可能变为不可避免”。
    斯大林在他一生的后期犯了一些严重的错误。这些错误同他的伟大的功勋相较，只是第二位的。现在，从斯大林的错误中得出来的严重教训，已经成为国际共产主义运动的一项重要的财产，它和苏联共产党的一系列成功的经验一样起着积极的作用，可以而且应该用来提高一切共产主义者的觉悟，从而防止重犯这种错误，并且推进共产主义事业的发展。
    在斯大林逝世以后，国际共产主义运动在最近几年来有了重大的发展，并且已经进入一个新阶段。1957年11月在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党会议，不但在空前的规模上表现了国际共产主义运动的坚强的团结，而且更重要的是这个会议总结了近一百年来特别是十月革命以来的无产阶级革命和社会主义建设的共同规律。莫斯科会议宣言，是各国人民争取世界持久和平的最鲜明的旗帜，是各国共产党和工人党为共产主义事业最后胜利而进行革命斗争的最锐利的武器，也是它们的国际主义团结的思想政治基础。帝国主义者及南斯拉夫现代修正主义者，曾经乘着苏联共产党批判斯大林的一些错误的时候大肆攻击了各国共产党和社会主义国家，掀起了全世界规模的反共高潮。这恰恰赤裸裸地暴露了帝国主义者和南斯拉夫现代修正主义者的反革命的丑恶的面目。在一场激烈的斗争中，帝国主义者和南斯拉夫现代修正主义者破坏国际共产主义运动的阴谋破产了。共产主义事业正以不可阻挡之势向前发展。当然，共产主义的敌人只要存在一天，就一天不会停止它们的破坏活动。因此，我们必须对帝国主义者的阴谋和对作为共产主义的叛徒的现代修正主义者提高警惕。我们必须高举共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言这个伟大的旗帜，像保护眼珠一样保护社会主义国家、各国共产党和国际工人阶级的团结，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，在反对战争势力和侵略势力的斗争中，使世界和平事业从胜利走向胜利；在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，使国际共产主义运动从胜利走向胜利。（附图片）
