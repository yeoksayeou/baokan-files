　　Hefei, December 9th (from our newspaper) - The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is actively taking measures to seize the time in the first and middle ten days of December, accelerate the transfer and transportation of pig iron to support Shanghai, and ensure that Shanghai has sufficient pig iron to complete this year's steel production increase plan.

　　The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to not only complete their own steel production increase plans in the last month of this year, but also to ensure the steel production increase plan of Shanghai, a key national priority. By the end of November, the province had completed 96.3% of the pig iron plan transferred to Shanghai. The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to not only complete the original plan ahead of schedule in December, but also to increase the transfer of a batch of pig iron from the province's increased pig iron production to support Shanghai's steelmaking. This iron must be transferred and transported more in the first and middle ten days of the month. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, the Provincial Party Committee decided: 1. Strictly control iron use within the province. Except for a small, most urgently needed portion allocated in batches in the first and middle ten days of the month according to the allocation plan, all other iron use will be postponed to the last ten days of the month for allocation. In December, the iron used by each special municipality should only be used after the region's external transfer tasks are completed. The iron produced by each ironmaking plant and workshop must be subject to unified allocation, and iron must not be used without authorization. 2. Each steelmaking plant should strive to reduce pig iron consumption in steelmaking, save pig iron, and enrich the source of iron for external transfer. 3. Collect social iron sources. All steel plants and machinery plants should concentrate the existing waste castings from sand casting and transfer them to Shanghai for steelmaking. All steel plants and all iron-using units must thoroughly clear their pig iron inventories and transfer the non-urgent pig iron to Shanghai first. 4. Each local municipal party committee and each factory party committee must have a secretary personally in charge of the iron transfer work, check the progress daily, and promptly study and solve existing problems. The transfer and transportation work should adopt a "long-term plan, short-term arrangement" approach. The provincial planning committee, metallurgical department, and transportation command will arrange and check the external transfer tasks every five days, and the external transfer situation will be counted twice a day.

　　Currently, all localities and municipal party committees are actively responding to the Provincial Party Committee's call to ensure the early completion of the plan to increase the transfer of pig iron to support Shanghai. After the Provincial Party Committee specifically convened a telephone conference of the secretaries of the local and municipal party committees on the 3rd to transfer iron to support Shanghai, deployments were made on the same day. The secretaries of each municipal party committee personally went to various ironmaking plants and workshops to investigate iron sources and strengthen short-distance collection and transportation. On the 4th, in addition to transferring more than 4,000 tons of pig iron, more than 9,000 tons of pig iron were collected and transported to stations and ports throughout the province. On the 5th, more than 14,000 tons of pig iron were transferred from the province. The person in charge of the Ma'anshan Municipal Party Committee personally took charge of the allocation of railway cars. The workers persisted in transporting iron in the rain, and the city transported 6,000 tons of pig iron in one day. The mechanical factories in Hefei reported that they had 1,500 tons of pig iron and waste castings from sand casting that were temporarily not in use, and they are actively transferring them. From the 1st to the 5th, the province transferred 25,160 tons of pig iron to Shanghai, and the average daily transfer volume increased by 60% compared to the same period last month.

    抓紧岁末  保证重点  再为炼钢出把力
    安徽增调生铁驰援上海
    严格控制省内用铁，加强短途集运，力争多调多运
    本报合肥9日电　中共安徽省委积极采取措施，抓紧12月上中旬的时间，加速调运生铁支援上海，保证上海有充分的生铁完成今年钢的增产计划。
    省委要求各地在今年最后一个月内不仅要完成本地区的钢铁增产计划，更要保证全国重点上海的炼钢增产计划。到11月底全省已完成调给上海的生铁计划的96.3％，省委要求各地在12月份内除提前完成原订计划外，并从全省增产的生铁中再增调一批生铁支援上海炼钢。这些铁要在上中旬内多调多运。为了确保这一计划的实现，省委决定：一、严格控制本省用铁，除按调拨计划把最急需的一部分，在上中旬分批拨给外，其余用铁一律推迟到下旬调拨。12月份各专市自用铁，应在地区外调任务完成以后才能动用。各个炼铁厂、车间生产的铁都要服从统一调动，不得擅自用铁。二、各炼钢厂要力争降低炼钢生铁损耗，节约生铁，充实外调铁源。三、搜集社会铁源，各钢铁厂、机械厂要把现有的翻砂报废的铸件等，都集中起来调上海炼钢。各个钢铁厂和所有用铁单位，要彻底清理生铁库存，把不急用的生铁先调上海。四、各地市委各厂党委都要有一个书记亲自掌握调铁工作，逐日检查进度，及时研究解决存在的问题。调运工作要采取“长计划，短安排”，外调任务由省计委、冶金厅、运输指挥部每五天安排和检查一次，外调情况每天统计两次。
    目前，各地、市委都积极响应省委号召，保证提前完成增调生铁支援上海的计划，在省委3日专门召开调铁支援上海的地市委书记电话会议后，都于当日进行了部署，各市委书记亲赴各炼铁厂、车间调查铁源，加强短途集运工作。4日，全省除调四千多吨生铁外，集运到车站、港口的生铁有九千多吨。5日，全省即调运出生铁一万四千多吨，马鞍山市委负责人亲自掌握车皮调度工作，工人们在大雨中仍坚持运铁，全市一天就运出生铁六千吨。合肥市各机械厂自报暂时不用的生铁和翻砂报废的铸件就有一千五百多吨，正积极调运。1至5日全省调上海生铁二万五千一百六十吨，平均日调量比上月同期增加60％。
