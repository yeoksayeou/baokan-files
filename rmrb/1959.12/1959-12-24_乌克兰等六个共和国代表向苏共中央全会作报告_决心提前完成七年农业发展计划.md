　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 23rd: TASS reports: The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union heard a report from Polyansky, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federal Republic, on the 22nd, followed by reports from representatives of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and four other republics on further developing agriculture.

　　In their reports, they discussed the agricultural production achievements of their respective republics and set forth the goal of completing the seven-year (1959-1965) agricultural development plan ahead of schedule.

　　Podgorny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, said in his report that the working people of Ukraine have decided to complete the seven-year plan for industrial production in five to six years and the seven-year plan for agriculture in five years. This means that by 1963, the republic's grain output will reach 2.1 billion poods, sugar beets 40 million tons, meat 4.3 million tons, and milk 26.5 million tons. Meat production will be 1.2 times higher than in 1958, almost doubling the original planned growth for the seven years.

　　Podgorny pointed out that preliminary statistics show that the level Ukraine has already achieved in agriculture this year makes it confident of completing the seven-year agricultural development plan in five years.

　　Podgorny emphasized that in the coming years, the main direction for developing agriculture in Ukraine will remain to vigorously increase grain production. The republic plans to achieve an average grain yield of 19 to 20 centners per hectare by 1963. The Communist Party of Ukraine believes that one of the main tasks is to eliminate the large disparities in yield per unit area in various regions in the coming years. Improving labor productivity and reducing product costs are central tasks in developing collective farm production.

　　Podgorny spoke about strengthening the public economy of collective farms. He said that in the past five years, the annual reserve fund appropriations of collective farms in the Ukrainian Republic have almost tripled. This year, the scale of public works construction in the republic's rural areas has greatly expanded. More than 1,000 joint organizations and enterprises run by collective farms have completed construction projects worth nearly 1 billion rubles, and about 85% of the collective farms in the republic have participated in jointly run organizations and enterprises.

　　Belyayev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, said in his report that agricultural workers in the Kazakh Republic will do everything possible to achieve the level of agricultural and animal husbandry production stipulated for 1965 by 1963.

　　Belyayev pointed out that the Kazakh Republic has reclaimed more than 23 million hectares of wasteland in recent years and has become the Soviet Union's second largest grain-producing area, and ranks second in the Soviet Union in terms of commodity grain output, second only to the Russian Federation. The Kazakh Republic has the potential to reclaim another 4 to 5 million hectares of wasteland.

　　Belyayev pointed out that vigorously increasing grain production remains the main task of agriculture in the Kazakh Republic. He said that it is necessary for the republic to establish another 250 to 280 state farms in the next two to three years, mainly state livestock farms.

　　Mazurov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus, said in his report that the Belarusian Republic has completed its annual plan for industrial production ahead of schedule this year, and by the end of the year, it will produce 1 billion rubles more products than originally planned. Despite the severe drought this summer, which was the worst in half a century, preliminary statistics show that the republic's grain harvest is roughly the same as last year. The increase in meat production this year is roughly equal to the increase in the past five years, and milk production will increase by 15%.

　　Mazurov said that the republic's collective farms and state farms plan to produce an average of about 40 centners of meat per 100 hectares of land in 1960, which is 35% more than this year; milk production will be about 170 centners, which is an increase of 25% over this year. He pointed out that the republic has the potential to complete the seven-year plan in five to six years, and by 1965 it will greatly exceed the originally stipulated level, producing 560 centners of milk and 90 centners of meat (slaughter weight) per 100 hectares of land.

　　Mazurov said that in order to complete the task of livestock product production stipulated in the seven-year plan ahead of schedule, Belarus guarantees to increase the republic's total grain output by 70% in 1960 compared to this year.

　　Rashidov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan, pointed out in his report that Uzbekistan, the Soviet Union's largest cotton-producing area, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, with a total raw cotton harvest of 3.15 million tons. In 1960, the republic guarantees to harvest and sell 3.17 million tons of seed cotton to the state.

　　Rashidov said that cotton growers in the Uzbek Republic have decided to reach the level of cotton production stipulated at the end of the seven-year plan (1965) one year ahead of schedule. In addition, the republic has also decided to reach the 1965 silkworm cocoon production level stipulated in the seven-year plan one year ahead of schedule, complete the seven-year plan for meat and milk production two years ahead of schedule, and complete the seven-year plan for vegetable, potato, and melon production three years ahead of schedule.

　　Rashidov pointed out that improving agricultural technical equipment and improving cultivation levels play an important role in developing agriculture in the Uzbek Republic.

　　The meeting continued on the 23rd.

　　Urzhabayev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, reported on Tajikistan's agricultural situation at the meeting. He emphasized that the revolutionary measures taken by the Soviet Union in recent years to drastically improve all sectors of agriculture mark a new stage in the development and consolidation of the collective farm system.

　　He said that Tajik cotton farmers sold 475,000 tons of seed cotton to the state this year, exceeding the plan by 25,000 tons. The republic has never had such a large bumper harvest. He said that there is now not a single collective farm or state farm in Tajikistan that harvests less than 20 centners of cotton per hectare.

　　When talking about the plan for 1960, Urzhabayev said that the task put forward by the republic is to increase cotton production to 480,000 tons, and the production of meat and wool will increase by 20% compared to this year.

　　He said that Tajik cotton farmers have decided to reach the original 1965 production level (560,000 tons) in 1964, and at the same time complete the production tasks of other agricultural products stipulated in the seven-year plan ahead of schedule.

　　Urzhabayev emphasized that Tajikistan is a shining example of implementing Lenin's legacy on eliminating the economic imbalances of all nationalities and on raising backward nationalities to the level of advanced nationalities.

　　Next, Akhundov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, delivered a report. He said that the various measures taken by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in agriculture in recent years have received the full support of collective farmers. These measures have caused an unprecedented surge in agricultural production, and they show how much tremendous power is inherent in the collective farm system.

　　When talking about the development of agricultural production in Azerbaijan, Akhundov said that compared with 1953, Azerbaijan's grain production has increased by 87%, tea has increased by 1.1 times, and tobacco has increased by 50%.

　　In these years, meat production has increased by 51%, milk has increased by 80%, and wool has increased by 48%.

　　Akhundov said that agricultural workers in Azerbaijan are determined to complete the seven-year plan for grape, fruit, meat, milk, and wool production in five years; complete the seven-year plan for silkworm cocoon and green tea production in four years; and complete the seven-year plan for tobacco production in three years.

　　He emphasized the importance of cotton cultivation to Azerbaijan. He said that although this year's conditions were very bad, 302,000 tons of seed cotton were sold to the state, which is more than 30,000 tons more than last year. By 1965, the last year of the seven-year plan, this republic will increase cotton production to 600,000 tons.

　　The meeting is continuing.

　　乌克兰等六个共和国代表向苏共中央全会作报告
    决心提前完成七年农业发展计划
    新华社莫斯科23日电　据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议22日在听取了俄罗斯联邦共和国部长会议主席波利扬斯基的报告后，接着听取了乌克兰、哈萨克等四个共和国的代表就进一步发展农业问题所作的报告。
    他们在报告中谈到了本共和国的农业生产成就，并提出了提前完成七年（1959—1965年）农业发展计划的奋斗目标。
    乌克兰共产党中央委员会第一书记波德戈尔内在报告中说，乌克兰劳动人民决定在五、六年内完成工业生产的七年计划，在五年内完成农业的七年计划。这就是说，在1963年，共和国的谷物产量就将达到二十一亿普特，甜菜达到四千万吨，肉类达到四百三十万吨，奶类达到二千六百五十万吨。肉类生产将比1958年多一点二倍，差不多比七年计划原订的增长额高一倍。
    波德戈尔内指出，初步统计材料表明，乌克兰今年在农业方面所已达到的水平，使得它有把握在五年内完成七年农业发展计划。
    波德戈尔内强调指出，今后几年，乌克兰发展农业的主要方针仍然是大力增产谷物。共和国计划在1963年使谷物的每公顷产量平均达到十九公担到二十公担。乌克兰共产党认为主要任务之一是，在最近几年内消除各地在单位面积产量方面的悬殊状况。提高劳动生产率和降低产品成本是发展集体农庄生产的中心任务。
    波德戈尔内谈到了加强集体农庄公有经济的问题。他说，最近五年来，乌克兰共和国的集体农庄每年的公积金提成差不多增加了三倍。今年，共和国农村的公共工程的建筑规模大大扩大了。集体农庄合办的一千个以上的机构和企业完成了价值将近十亿卢布的建筑工程，全共和国约85％的集体农庄参加了集体农庄联合开办的机构和企业。
    哈萨克共产党中央委员会第一书记别利亚耶夫在报告中说，哈萨克共和国的农业工作者将尽一切努力，争取在1963年就达到规定在1965年达到的农牧业产品生产水平。
    别利亚耶夫指出，哈萨克共和国最近几年来开垦了两千三百万公顷以上的荒地，它已成为苏联第二个大谷物产区，而且在商品粮食产量方面居苏联的第二位，仅次于俄罗斯联邦。哈萨克共和国有可能再开垦四百万到五百万公顷的荒地。
    别利亚耶夫指出，大力增加谷物生产仍然是哈萨克共和国农业的主要任务。他说，共和国有必要在最近两三年内再建立二百五十至二百八十个国营农场，其中主要是建立国营畜牧农场。
    白俄罗斯共产党中央委员会第一书记马祖罗夫在报告中说，白俄罗斯共和国今年提前完成了工业生产的年度计划，到年底将比原计划多生产十亿卢布的产品。尽管今年夏天遭到了半世纪来未曾有过的大旱，但是，据初步统计，共和国的谷物收获量仍和去年大致相等。今年肉类生产的增长额差不多等于最近五年来的增长额，奶类生产将增加15％。
    马祖罗夫说，共和国集体农庄和国营农场计划在1960年使每一百公顷土地上平均大约出产四十公担肉类，即比今年多生产35％；奶类生产大约为一百七十公担，即比今年增加25％。他指出，共和国有可能在五年到六年内完成七年计划，而到1965年就将大大超过原来规定的水平，使每一百公顷土地出产五百六十公担奶类和九十公担肉类（屠宰量）。
    马祖罗夫说，为了提前完成七年计划规定的畜产品生产的任务，白俄罗斯保证要使共和国的谷物总产量在1960年比今年增加70％。
    乌兹别克共产党中央委员会第一书记拉希多夫在报告中指出，苏联最大的棉花产地——乌兹别克共和国今年获得了历史上空前未有的大丰收，原棉总收获量达三百一十五万吨。在1960年，共和国保证收获并交售给国家三百一十七万吨籽棉。
    拉希多夫说，乌兹别克共和国植棉者决定提前一年达到规定在七年计划结束时（1965年）所要达到的棉花生产水平。此外，共和国还决定提前一年达到七年计划规定的1965年的蚕茧生产水平，提前二年完成肉类和奶类生产的七年计划，提前三年完成蔬菜、马铃薯和瓜类生产的七年计划。
    拉希多夫指出，改进农业技术设备和提高耕作水平在发展乌兹别克共和国的农业方面占有重要地位。
    会议在23日继续举行。
    塔吉克共产党中央委员会第一书记乌尔扎巴耶夫在会上就塔吉克的农业情况作了报告。他强调指出，最近几年苏联实行的急剧提高农业各部门的革命性措施，标志着集体农庄制度的发展和巩固的新阶段。
    他说，塔吉克棉农今年交售给国家四十七万五千吨籽棉，超过计划二万五千吨。共和国从来没有获得这样大的丰收。他说，现在塔吉克没有一个集体农庄和国营农场每公顷收获的棉花少于二十公担。
    乌尔扎巴耶夫在谈到1960年的计划时说，共和国提出的任务是，把棉花生产提高到四十八万吨，肉类和羊毛的生产将比今年增加20％。
    他说，塔吉克的棉农决定在1964年达到原订的1965年的生产水平（五十六万吨），同时提前完成七年计划所规定的其他农产品的生产任务。
    乌尔扎巴耶夫着重指出，塔吉克是执行列宁关于消灭各民族的经济不平衡、关于把落后民族提高到先进民族水平的遗训的光辉榜样。
    接着，阿塞拜疆共产党中央委员会第一书记阿洪多夫作了报告。他说，苏联共产党最近几年来在农业方面所采取的各项措施受到了集体农民的完全支持。这些措施引起了农业生产空前未有的高涨，它们表明，在集体农庄制度内蕴藏着多么巨大的力量。
    阿洪多夫在谈到阿塞拜疆农业生产的发展时说，同1953年相比，阿塞拜疆的谷物生产增加了87％，茶叶增加了一点一倍，烟草增加了50％。
    在这几年中，肉类生产增加了51％，奶类增加了80％，羊毛增加了48％。
    阿洪多夫说，阿塞拜疆的农业劳动者决心要在五年内完成葡萄、水果、肉类、奶类和羊毛生产的七年计划；四年内完成蚕茧和绿茶生产的七年计划；三年内完成烟叶生产的七年计划。
    他着重指出了植棉业对阿塞拜疆的重要意义。他说，尽管今年的条件非常不好，但是却向国家出售了三十万零二千吨籽棉，比去年增多了三万多吨。到七年计划的最后一年1965年，这个共和国将把棉花产量提高到六十万吨。
    会议在继续进行中。
