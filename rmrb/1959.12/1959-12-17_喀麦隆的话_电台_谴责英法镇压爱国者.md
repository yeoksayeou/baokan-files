Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 13th: The "Radio Cameroon Speaks" radio station here said today that British colonialism is colluding with French colonialism to oppose the Cameroonian people. The radio program made this accusation while commenting on a news item stating that several Cameroonian patriots who had sought refuge in British Cameroons from French Cameroons had been extradited to the French authorities and sentenced to death. The commentary said that this shows that the British government is not satisfied with providing diplomatic support to France in the United Nations, but also helps the French to eliminate the Cameroonian people.

The commentary said that the British authorities' approach is also an extremely barbaric act, because the patriots extradited in this despicable manner have been sentenced to death and have also been ruthlessly executed.

The commentary called on people of all countries to take action to ensure that Cameroonian patriots fighting for freedom and independence are granted asylum.

    “喀麦隆的话”电台
    谴责英法镇压爱国者
    新华社开罗13日电　这里的“喀麦隆的话”电台今天说，英国殖民主义者同法国殖民主义者进行勾结来反对喀麦隆人民。这个电台节目是在评论一条消息时提出这个指责的。这条消息说，从法属喀麦隆地区前往英属喀麦隆避难的若干喀麦隆爱国者已被引渡给法国当局并且被判处了死刑。评论说，这表明英国政府并不满足于在联合国对法国给予外交上的支持，他们还帮助法国人来消灭喀麦隆人民。
    评论说，英国当局的这种做法也是极端野蛮的行动，因为以这种卑劣的方式引渡的爱国者已被判决死刑，而且也已经被无情地执行了。
    评论呼吁世界各国人民采取行动，以保证为自由和独立进行斗争的喀麦隆爱国者获得避难权。
