    A Spirit that Swallows Mountains and Rivers

    Silver hoes fall, linking the Five Ridges to the sky,
    Iron arms shake, moving the Three Rivers to the core.

Since the beginning of winter, the broad countryside has once again launched a mass movement for water conservancy construction with great enthusiasm. People are moving mountains and harnessing rivers, opening up rivers and building dams, determined to work hard through the winter and spring to accelerate the realization of water conservancy. This is a battle to transform the face of nature. Standing in front of the map of our motherland and gazing intently, it is as if the thousands of mountains and rivers are dancing gracefully, obeying the orders of the people and being used by the people. Every mountain and every river must contribute to the people. The great rivers and mountains of our motherland have become even more lovely in the hands of 600 million people.

The face of nature has been arranged since the beginning of time. Who would have ever imagined moving thousands of mountains and rivers? However, the people of our country, under the leadership of the Party, have not only become the masters of the country but also the masters of nature. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, people's mental outlook has been completely renewed, the communist style has been greatly promoted, and the heroic spirit of the people to change the "poor and blank" face of our national economy is truly a spirit that swallows mountains and rivers. Using this new mental outlook to control nature and conquer nature, the unchanging face of nature for thousands of years can only bow to our will.

To say that the people have a "spirit that swallows mountains and rivers" is not an exaggeration at all. If you don't believe it, please look at how many mountains and rivers have been conquered by the people in the high tide of water conservancy construction. In Henan Province, only one month after the large-scale winter water conservancy project began, more than 200 million cubic meters of earth and stone had been completed, more than 1,600 small reservoirs had been built, more than 1 million small canals and 210,000 water wells had been dug, and more than 30,000 pits, ponds, weirs, and dams, as well as more than 34,000 other projects, had been completed. Two million troops in Shaanxi Province are preparing to build more than 7,700 large, medium, and small water conservancy projects. They will not only control water but also control mountains, slopes, gullies, and plains, and do a good job in soil and water conservation. More than 4,000 employees of the Baojixia diversion project of the Wei River irrigation project are determined to "grab the dragon's nose and lead the Wei River to the plateau." The "dragon's nose" cannot be easily grabbed, of course, but it has been grabbed by them. They want to build a dam in Baojixia to block the Wei River and use a 20-meter-wide canal to divert water along the edge of the Weibei Plateau to the east into the plateau to irrigate more than 1.7 million mu of land. In this project, mountains have to be opened and ridges split, and many mountain tops have to be moved. Now the "cutoff cofferdam" and "excavation of the diversion channel" projects of the dam have been completed. This is truly a so-called "mountain swallowing" project. "River swallowing" projects are even more common. The Liuzhou Special Zone in Guangxi Province has started construction of 1,150 kilometers of canals to allow the 2,000-li Long River to take a new course and irrigate more than 2 million mu of land. Look! Isn't the 2,000-li Long River "swallowed" up?

"A spirit that swallows mountains and rivers," our people are using this fearless heroic spirit to change the face of nature and create a better and happier life. This spirit is nothing else but a manifestation of the strong revolutionary will and courageous creative spirit of our people.

People are changing the face of nature according to their own will, and at the same time, they are tempering themselves in the struggle to transform nature, strengthening their revolutionary ambition, and becoming more confident and courageous in continuing to conquer nature. Facts are always the most educational. This year, large areas of our country suffered from extraordinary disasters, and production in some areas was reduced due to disasters. However, judging from the total agricultural output of the country, it can still exceed the extraordinarily bumper harvest of last year, which must be attributed to the great development of water conservancy construction. Here's a ready example: Five communes in Changde County, Hunan Province, thoroughly harnessed the Wang River last winter, cutting off three rivers and building five large reservoirs capable of storing more than 200 million cubic meters of water. They dug tunnels and chiseled through six large stone mountains, connecting the five reservoirs and three rivers, solving the flood control and irrigation problems of more than 400,000 mu of paddy fields. This year, there was a severe drought for more than 100 days, but the early, middle, and late rice crops in the irrigation area all had bumper harvests. The masses in the Wang River basin sang: "Opening mountains and splitting ridges to create the ocean, the Wang River has since become a paradise. Not afraid of mountain floods, not afraid of drought, rice grains everywhere are like gold. The people's commune is infinitely good, and future generations will be happy forever. Drinking water does not forget the well digger, and will never forget the Communist Party."

"Seeing the world from a grain of sand," people have personally experienced the superiority of the people's commune from this year's disaster relief struggle, and have personally seen the power of water conservancy projects. Therefore, they no longer "rely on heaven" but want to "manage heaven"; no longer "wait for water" but want to "control water." Thus, the people's heroic spirit of moving mountains and harnessing rivers and swallowing mountains and rivers is even more high-spirited. The "spirit" mentioned here refers to the soaring revolutionary vigor and the development of mass wisdom. The entire process of the Gansu Yintao project is mechanized with earthwork. A high work efficiency campaign is carried out on the construction site, with great efforts in tool reform, self-run construction site factories, cultivation of technical forces, and improvement of labor organization. 60,000 people completed the tasks that used to require nearly 400,000 people. With this "spirit that swallows mountains and rivers" and the wisdom of "competing with heaven for ingenuity," how can the mountains and rivers of our motherland not obey the orders of the people?

People are engaging in water conservancy on a large scale, with a spirit that swallows mountains and rivers, so that every water conservancy project becomes a sweet spring that nurtures fertile fields and harvests. However, within our Party, there is a small group of right-leaning opportunists who deliberately fail to face up to this new atmosphere. They slander our Great Leap Forward and also slander the achievements of the people's mass water conservancy construction. In fact, what can be done about this? The mountains and rivers on our motherland will always serve the people, and the brilliant achievements of socialist construction will never be diminished by their curses.

    气吞山河
    柳笛
    天连五岭银锄落，
    地动三河铁臂摇。
    入冬以来，广大农村又一次展开了热火朝天的水利建设的群众运动。人们移山治水、开河筑坝，要大干一冬春，加速实现水利化。这是一场改造自然面貌的战斗。站在祖国的地图前面凝神注目，仿佛感到那千山万水在翩翩起舞，它们听从着人民的调动，受着人民的使唤，一山一水都要为人民作出贡献。我们祖国的大好河山，在六亿人民的手里变得更加可爱了。
    自然界的面貌，是开天辟地以来就被安排好了的。谁曾设想过要把千山万水搬个家呢？可是，我国的人民，在党的领导下不仅做了国家的主人，也做了自然界的主人。特别是大跃进以来，人们的精神面貌焕然一新，共产主义风格大加发扬，人们要改变我国国民经济“一穷二白”面貌的英雄气概真是气吞山河。用这种新的精神面貌去支配自然，战胜自然，于是那万年不变的自然面貌就只能俯首听命了。
    说人民“气吞山河”，真是一点也不过分。不信请看，在水利建设高潮中，有多少山、多少水，被人民征服了。河南省大规模冬修水利工程开始才一个月，就已经完成了两亿多立方米土、石方，修建小型水库一千六百多座，小渠道一百多万条、水井二十一万眼，坑、塘、堰、坝三万多处，还有其他工程三万四千多处。陕西省二百万雄师正着手修建大、中、小水利工程七千七百多处，他们不仅治水、还要治山、治坡、治沟、治原，做好水土保持工作。宝鸡峡引渭灌溉工程枢纽大坝的四千多名职工，一定要“扭住龙鼻子，引渭上高原”。“龙鼻子”当然不是轻易可以扭住的，但是毕竟被他们扭住了。他们要在宝鸡峡修一个大坝，把渭水拦住，用二十米宽的大渠，引水沿渭北高原的边缘蜿蜒而东导入高原，去灌溉一百七十多万亩的土地。在这项工程中，要开山劈岭，让许多山头搬家。现在大坝的“截流围堰”“开挖引河”工程已经完成了。这真是所谓“吞山”的工程。“吞河”工程更是多见。广西柳州专区动工修建一千一百五十公里的渠道，让两千里的龙江改走新道，灌溉二百多万亩的田地。你瞧！两千里的龙江不是被“吞”下去了吗？
    “气吞山河”，我国人民就是用这种无畏的英雄气概，改变着自然的面貌，创造着美好幸福的生活。这种气概，不是别的，正是表现了我国人民坚强的革命意志和勇敢的创造精神。
    人们按照自己的意志改变自然面貌，同时，也在改造自然的斗争中锻炼了自己，坚定了革命的雄心壮志，对于继续战胜自然更加信心百倍，勇气十足。事实总是最富有教育力量的。今年我国广大地区遭受了特大灾害，部分地区因灾减产，可是，就全国农业的总产量来看，仍可超过特大丰收的去年，这不能不归功于水利建设的大发展。顺手拈来一个例子：湖南省常德县五个公社，去年冬天根治枉水，截断三条河、兴修五座能蓄水两亿多公方的大水库，打隧道凿通六座大石山，把五座水库串通，三条河连成一气，解决了四十多万亩稻田的防洪、灌溉问题。今年这里一百多天大旱，可是灌区的早、中、晚水稻都获得丰收。枉水流域的群众歌唱：“开山劈岭造海洋，枉水从此变天堂，不怕山洪不怕旱，遍地稻谷似金黄。人民公社无限好，子孙万代乐无疆，饮水不忘挖井人，万年不忘共产党。”
    “从一粒沙看世界”，人们从今年的抗灾斗争中，亲身体会到了人民公社的优越性，亲眼看到了水利工程显示的威力，因此，不再“靠天”，而要“管天”；不再“等水”，而要“治水”。于是，人们移山治水，气吞山河的英雄气概更加昂扬。这里所说的“气”一是指冲天的革命干劲，一是指群众智慧的发挥。甘肃引洮工程全部工序土机械化，工地上开展高工效运动，大搞工具改革，自办工地工厂，培养技术力量，改善劳动组织，六万人完成了过去需要近四十万人完成的任务。就凭着这种“气吞山河”的意志和“巧夺天工”的智慧，我们祖国的万水千山怎能不听从人民的使唤呢？
    人们大搞水利，气吞山河，要使每一项水利工程都成为润育良田丰收的甘泉。然而，在我们党内，却有那么一小撮右倾机会主义分子，他们有意不去正视这种新的气象。他们污蔑我国的大跃进，也污蔑人民群众的水利建设成绩。其实，这有什么办法呢？我们祖国土地上的千山万水总是要为人民服务的，社会主义建设的辉煌成绩也总不会因为他们的咒骂丝毫减色。
