The Tanggemu Farm in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, built a sugar factory with a daily output of 400 jin in the spirit of making use of simple and crude methods.

This sugar factory is the first sugar factory on the Tanggemu Grassland. It has now officially started production. They also plan to extract fruit candies, preserves, soy sauce, alcohol, vinegar and other products from by-products.

    塘格木建成糖厂
    青海省海南藏族自治州塘格木农场本着因陋就简的精神，建成了一座日产四百斤的糖厂。
    这座糖厂是塘格木草原上的第一个糖厂。现在已经开始正式生产。他们还准备从副产品中制取水果糖、酱果、酱油、酒精、醋等产品。
