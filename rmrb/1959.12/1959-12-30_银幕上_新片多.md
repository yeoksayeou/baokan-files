　　To celebrate the New Year and enrich the capital's people's holiday cultural life, Beijing's cinemas and clubs, in addition to screening the popular color feature films "Lin Zexu" and "The Lin Family Shop," and the films that were shown throughout the year, "People Who Dare to Think and Act" and "The Road to Happiness," will also show "Tempered Will" produced by the August First Film Studio, the Soviet "Animated Film Collection" that has been loved by audiences, and the Norwegian feature film "One Night" reflecting the Norwegian people's struggle against the Fascist bandits. The following are introductions to several new films that will also be screened:

　　Growing Up in the Revolutionary Storm
　　The new Soviet film "Girl from Kiev" is an excellent film.
　　Galya, the girl from Kiev, grew up in the storm of revolution. She lost her relatives, but the Party and Soviet society raised her. She loves her work, and actively improves tools with her comrades in the Communist Youth League, improves production efficiency, and wages a resolute struggle against hidden enemies. But a happy life was destroyed by the Fascists. Galya's family joined the sacred battle to defend the motherland. Galya, who loves her motherland and is loyal to the people, has withstood severe tests and gloriously joined the Party. After defeating the Fascist bandits, she joined the people of the whole country in building a paradise on earth. On the occasion of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, she reviewed the hardships and happiness she experienced since she was born on the same day as the socialist motherland, and marched towards the great communist goal with even greater confidence.

　　Leap Forward in Literary and Art Garland
　　The color long documentary "Leap Forward Flowers Bloom Red," recently produced by the August First Film Studio, focuses on fragments of excellent programs from the Second Literary and Art Performance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
　　Such as one of the most popular programs among the audience, the "General Chorus," fragments of the dance dramas "Five Red Clouds" and "Immortal Soldiers," as well as "Battlefield Music," which describes the revolutionary optimism of the Volunteer Army performed by amateur performance teams. These literary and artistic flowers, which bloomed brilliantly during the Great Leap Forward, have been carefully woven into a beautiful garland by the directors and presented to the audience.

　　Widescreen Film "Dark Morning"
　　This is the last part of A. Tolstoy's famous trilogy "The Road to Calvary." The film tells the story of the ideological transformation of intellectuals in the struggle to defend the Soviet regime. Teregin threw himself into the Red Army and participated in the fiery struggle, and became strong and mature. His lover, Dasha, also became a Red Army nurse and fought together to defend the young Soviet regime. The wavering Roschin went through a long and tortuous road. Under the education of reality, he finally stood on the side of the people and joined the Red Army.

　　"Borrowing a Bride" on the Screen
　　The opera art film "Borrowing a Bride" is adapted from the same-named Dian opera and is a comedy. Through the accidental and absurd plot of the scholar Li Chunlin borrowing Zhang Guiying to act as his wife, it humorously and incisively exposes the evils of the feudal arranged marriage system, and praises the bold and witty struggle of the girl Zhang Guiying, who sold herself to bury her father, in order to get rid of the life of being humiliated and pursue happiness. Like many traditional dramas of Dian opera with folk tales as their themes, it has a strong local color.

　　Wonderful Acrobatics
　　During the happy days of the 6th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival held in Moscow, acrobats from eleven countries performed beautiful and lively acrobatics with their own characteristics. This colorful documentary "Friendship Stage" will allow us to appreciate these acrobatic performances that frequently added color to the festival.

　　银幕上　新片多
    为了庆贺新年，丰富首都人民节日的文娱生活，北京市各电影院和俱乐部，除分别上映深受群众欢迎的彩色故事片“林则徐”“林家铺子”，和夸年度映出的国产片“敢想敢干的人”“康庄大道”等片以外，还有八一厂新出品的“烈火真金”，曾受到观众喜爱的苏联“美术片集锦”，反映挪威人民与法西斯匪帮作斗争的挪威故事片“如此一个夜晚”。下面介绍的几部新片也要放映：
    在革命风暴里成长
    苏联新片“基辅姑娘”，是一部优秀的影片。
    基辅姑娘迦丽亚是在革命的暴风雨里长大的。她失去了亲人，可是，党和苏维埃社会把她抚养成人。她热爱工作，和共青团小组的同志们积极改进工具，提高了生产效率，和暗藏的敌人进行了坚决的斗争。可是幸福的生活被法西斯破坏了。迦丽亚一家投入了保卫祖国的神圣战斗。爱祖国、忠于人民的迦丽亚，经受住了严峻的考验，光荣地入了党。在战胜法西斯强盗后，又和全国人民一道，建设着人间乐园。在庆祝十月革命四十周年的日子里，她回顾自己跟社会主义祖国同一天诞生所经历的艰苦和幸福的日月，更加信心百倍地向伟大的共产主义目标迈进。
    跃进的文艺花环
    八一厂最近摄制的彩色长纪录片“跃进花开朵朵红”集中辑录了中国人民解放军第二届文艺会演中部分优秀节目的片断。
    如最受观众欢迎的节目之一的“将军大合唱”、舞剧“五朵红云”和“不朽的战士”的片断，以及业余演出队演出的描写志愿军的革命乐观主义精神的“战地音乐”等。这些大跃进中开放得绚丽夺目的文艺花朵，经导演们精心地结成了美丽的花环，献给了观众。
    宽银幕影片“阴暗的早晨”
    这是阿·托尔斯泰名著“苦难的历程”三部曲的最后一部。影片叙述在保卫苏维埃政权的斗争中，知识分子的思想改造过程。杰列金投身在红军中，参加了火热斗争，锻炼得坚强成熟了，他的爱人达霞也成了红军护士，共同为捍卫年轻的苏维埃政权而斗争。动摇的罗申走过了漫长和曲折的道路，在现实的教育下，终于站到人民一面来，参加了红军。
    “借亲配”上银幕
    戏曲艺术片“借亲配”，是根据同名滇剧改编的，是一个喜剧。它通过书生李春林借张桂英假作妻子这一偶然的荒唐情节，诙谐而辛辣地揭露了封建买卖婚姻制度的罪恶，赞扬了卖身葬父的少女张桂英为摆脱受人凌辱的生活，追求幸福所进行的大胆而机智的斗争。它和滇剧的许多以民间故事为题材的传统剧目一样，具有较浓厚的地方色彩。
    精彩的杂技艺术
    在莫斯科举行的第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的幸福日子里，有十一个国家的杂技演员，表演了各具特色的优美而生动活泼的杂技艺术。“友谊舞台”这部五彩纪录片，将让我们欣赏到这些给联欢节频添彩色的杂技表演。
