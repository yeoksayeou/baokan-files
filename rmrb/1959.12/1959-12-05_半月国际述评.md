Semi-Monthly International Review

November 16th to December 4th

U.S. President Eisenhower left the country on the evening of December 3rd for a nearly twenty-day so-called "goodwill" visit to eleven countries in Western Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. What exactly is American foreign policy like? This has been one of the main topics of discussion in various countries recently.

Talking About DÃ©tente While Creating Tension

The American ruling class has recently made some gestures of willingness to ease international tensions, presenting itself as a "peace messenger," but they are also afraid that doing so will have unfavorable effects. Therefore, while some who play the role of the good cop are singing the tune of "peace," others who play the role of the bad cop continue to advocate for the "Cold War."

The "Cold War" clamoring from some responsible officials and politicians in the United States has not decreased compared to the past, but has become more frequent. Important figures such as Vice President Nixon and Secretary of State Herter, while talking about peace, also do not forget to maintain the "Cold War." Nixon openly said: "Western countries cannot accept what the Soviets call peaceful coexistence." Herter repeatedly emphasized the "unchanged importance" of military preparations for the North Atlantic Treaty nations. As for military and political leaders who are always known for advocating the "Cold War," such as Undersecretary of State Dillon, New York Governor Rockefeller, outgoing Defense Secretary McElroy, Air Force Chief of Staff White, U.S. Pacific Forces Commander Felt, and Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Group Burgess, they need not be mentioned. They do not miss any opportunity to clamor for stepping up war preparations, demanding the resumption of nuclear weapons testing, the development of missile weapons, the expansion of missile bases, and the increase of troops stationed abroad. The Fifth Annual Meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Conference held in Washington from November 16th to 20th became an important platform for the United States to incite the "Cold War." Under the leadership of Secretary of State Herter, American civil and military officials spread anti-Soviet hysteria, advocating continued arms expansion and strengthening military aggression groups. It is particularly noteworthy that at this time, some politicians in the opposition, such as former U.S. President Truman and former Secretary of State Acheson, were also eager to come forward and play an important role in the chorus of advocating the "Cold War." From the speeches of all these representative figures, it is not difficult for people to see what exactly is in the "bottom line" of the American ruling class.

The American authorities have not only not stopped the "Cold War" clamoring, but also actively engaged in activities that exacerbate international tensions everywhere. The United States has done quite blatantly in the United Nations General Assembly. After instigating the discussion of the so-called "Tibetan issue," the United States deliberately used the so-called "Hungarian issue" and "Korean issue" to carry out malicious slander and attacks on socialist countries, openly demanding to continue interfering in Hungary's internal affairs, and refusing to withdraw its invading troops from South Korea. Associated Press news analyst Roberts also admitted that the United States is intensifying the "Cold War" in the United Nations.

The "New York Times" published an article on November 25th by its well-known columnist Sulzberger from Washington, which is quite capable of reflecting the American ruling class's concerns about the easing of international tensions. Sulzberger pointed out that the United States' policy has not changed, but what has changed is public opinion, which is "having an increasing fondness" for the Soviet Union. He said that this "shift in public opinion" is "very disturbing from the American point of view. Reflected in our allies abroad, it is even more disturbing." Therefore, it is not surprising that more and more people have been advocating that "the West cannot relax" these days.

Behind the Smoke Screen of Peace

Since the American ruling class is unwilling to see the easing of international tensions, why does it have to make gestures of willingness to ease international tensions? In September, the British "News Chronicle" published a commentary. Of course, the author of this commentary could not or was unwilling to point out that the fundamental reason is that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is increasingly overwhelming the imperialist camp headed by the United States in the overall balance of power, that is, the East wind is prevailing over the West wind. However, the author, who reflects the weapon-only viewpoint of Western politicians and military men, said something that makes sense: "Russia has not only broken the United States' monopoly in nuclear weapons, but it is now dangerously ahead in long-range and medium-range missiles," which is the reason "that causes the United States to adopt a new flexibility in foreign policy."

The fact is indeed the case. Due to the rapid development of the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, especially after the successful launch of three red space rockets, more and more people in the American military and political circles have admitted that the United States has lost its military advantage in maintaining its so-called "position of strength." They especially emphasized that the United States is far behind the Soviet Union in missile weapons. They advocated "catching up quickly," catching up with the Soviet Union, and revitalizing the declining military strength of the United States. For example, U.S. Democratic Senator and former Air Force Secretary Symington said that by 1961, the Soviet Union's strength in intercontinental missiles would be four times that of the United States. He demanded that a larger amount of military spending be allocated to develop new weapons, especially intercontinental missiles. U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman McCone also shouted that the United States must take urgent action to maintain its "nuclear leadership." The outgoing former Defense Secretary McElroy, even one minute before stepping down, unreservedly announced that the United States is striving to accelerate the development of missiles, "By 1963, the United States will be able to master more types of means of launching hydrogen warheads to deal with the Soviet Union."

These remarks clearly reflect the views of the American ruling class. Faced with the reality of the changing balance of world power, the American authorities have no intention of abandoning their policy of aggression and war, and plan to revitalize the United States' military decline by stepping up the pace of arms expansion. This attempt to buy time is already embodied in current U.S. policy. Regardless of the huge financial deficit this year, the Eisenhower administration has decided to continue to maintain a huge military expenditure of 41 billion US dollars in the next fiscal year, focusing on the development of missiles. The American authorities are accelerating the research and manufacture of various intercontinental missiles and medium-range missiles, while stepping up the expansion of its intercontinental missile squadrons and expanding its network of missile bases at home and abroad, especially in Western Europe, Asia, and Africa. Obviously, the United States is starting a new round of the arms race.

It can be seen from this that the so-called willingness to maintain peace and ease international tensions expressed by the American authorities is nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up the bankruptcy of the U.S. "position of strength" policy and the stepping up of arms expansion and war preparations.

Tightening the Strings in the Far East

People must have noticed the activities of the United States in the Far East and Asian regions in recent times.

Recently, the United States has been particularly committed to slanderous propaganda against the Chinese people. The U.S. State Department published a booklet on Taiwan on November 16th, reiterating that the United States insists on its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, insists on long-term occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, and creates "two Chinas." Recently, many American military leaders have arrived in Taiwan and allocated more weapons to the Chiang Kai-shek troops for use, conducting military exercises in the Taiwan Strait, and carrying out new war threats. The American authorities, who have been armed occupying Chinese territory of Taiwan and carrying out aggression around the world, shamelessly made a lot of noise, slandering China as "belligerent."

Provoking the relationship between Asian and African countries and China is the main policy of the United States in recent times. A reporter from the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" stationed in Washington recently revealed the current strategy of the United States, saying that the United States "currently wants to expand the image of Communist China into the 'number one bad guy in the world'," so as to "achieve results in grasping Asian public opinion." After the failure of smearing China's Great Leap Forward and People's Communes, American politicians and propaganda machines are now more focused on attacking China as "more aggressive and threatening," attempting to scare other Asian and African countries. The role of the United States as a provocateur in Sino-Indian relations is particularly blatant. On the one hand, it distorts the facts, slandering China for "carrying out aggression" against India, and on the other hand, it incites India to adopt a "firm attitude" and "strengthen military measures." The "New York Times" even openly demanded that India not adopt a "restrained" policy. The United States' conspiracy to sow discord is also being used in other Asian countries.

The United States' activities to intensify tensions in the Far East and Asian regions have been very active recently. In Southeast Asia, the United States continues to step up its conspiracy to interfere in Laos by embezzling the United Nations flag, and is currently making every effort to place a permanent United Nations agency serving it in Laos; at the same time, the military personnel and weapons the United States has transported into Laos and South Vietnam have continued to increase. In Northeast Asia, the United States is stepping up the piecing together of a Northeast Asian aggression group. A secret military conference held in Baguio, Philippines, on November 14th and 15th, convened by U.S. Pacific Area Armed Forces Commander Felt, with representatives from the Philippines, Japan, and the Chiang Kai-shek group, is closely related to this plan. In Japan, the United States is colluding with the Kishi government to prepare to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in mid-January next year, and Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama has even impatiently announced the aggressive essence of this U.S.-Japan military alliance against China and the Soviet Union. The United States has also recently conducted a series of separate or joint military exercises in the Pacific region, including large-scale missile exercises held in Okinawa. These facts show that the United States' activities to create tensions in the Far East have not been relaxed at all compared to the past. U.S. Pacific Army Commander White clamored in Taipei on November 16th: "The Cold War in Asia has not eased." He even openly threatened: "Hot war is not impossible," which truly reveals the United States' true intentions in the Far East at present.

In summary, people can clearly see that the certain peace gestures made by the United States recently are due to the increasingly obvious situation of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind," and the United States is facing the strong pressure of the people of the world demanding lasting peace, and has to change its methods of pursuing aggression and war policies. The United States is spreading a smokescreen of peace to confuse and paralyze the people of various countries, while continuing to carry out conspiracies against socialist countries, against national democratic movements, and against world peace. However, it can be asserted that this two-faced trick of the United States will not last long, because the thin smokescreen of peace will eventually not be able to cover up the activities of arms expansion and war preparations.
