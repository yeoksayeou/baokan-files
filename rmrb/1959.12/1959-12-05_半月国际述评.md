Semi-Monthly International Review

November 16th to December 4th

U.S. President Eisenhower left the country on the evening of December 3rd for a nearly twenty-day so-called "goodwill" visit to eleven countries in Western Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. What exactly is American foreign policy like? This has been one of the main topics of discussion in various countries recently.

Talking About Détente While Creating Tension

The American ruling class has recently made some gestures of willingness to ease international tensions, presenting itself as a "peace messenger," but they are also afraid that doing so will have unfavorable effects. Therefore, while some who play the role of the good cop are singing the tune of "peace," others who play the role of the bad cop continue to advocate for the "Cold War."

The "Cold War" clamoring from some responsible officials and politicians in the United States has not decreased compared to the past, but has become more frequent. Important figures such as Vice President Nixon and Secretary of State Herter, while talking about peace, also do not forget to maintain the "Cold War." Nixon openly said: "Western countries cannot accept what the Soviets call peaceful coexistence." Herter repeatedly emphasized the "unchanged importance" of military preparations for the North Atlantic Treaty nations. As for military and political leaders who are always known for advocating the "Cold War," such as Undersecretary of State Dillon, New York Governor Rockefeller, outgoing Defense Secretary McElroy, Air Force Chief of Staff White, U.S. Pacific Forces Commander Felt, and Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Group Burgess, they need not be mentioned. They do not miss any opportunity to clamor for stepping up war preparations, demanding the resumption of nuclear weapons testing, the development of missile weapons, the expansion of missile bases, and the increase of troops stationed abroad. The Fifth Annual Meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Conference held in Washington from November 16th to 20th became an important platform for the United States to incite the "Cold War." Under the leadership of Secretary of State Herter, American civil and military officials spread anti-Soviet hysteria, advocating continued arms expansion and strengthening military aggression groups. It is particularly noteworthy that at this time, some politicians in the opposition, such as former U.S. President Truman and former Secretary of State Acheson, were also eager to come forward and play an important role in the chorus of advocating the "Cold War." From the speeches of all these representative figures, it is not difficult for people to see what exactly is in the "bottom line" of the American ruling class.

The American authorities have not only not stopped the "Cold War" clamoring, but also actively engaged in activities that exacerbate international tensions everywhere. The United States has done quite blatantly in the United Nations General Assembly. After instigating the discussion of the so-called "Tibetan issue," the United States deliberately used the so-called "Hungarian issue" and "Korean issue" to carry out malicious slander and attacks on socialist countries, openly demanding to continue interfering in Hungary's internal affairs, and refusing to withdraw its invading troops from South Korea. Associated Press news analyst Roberts also admitted that the United States is intensifying the "Cold War" in the United Nations.

The "New York Times" published an article on November 25th by its well-known columnist Sulzberger from Washington, which is quite capable of reflecting the American ruling class's concerns about the easing of international tensions. Sulzberger pointed out that the United States' policy has not changed, but what has changed is public opinion, which is "having an increasing fondness" for the Soviet Union. He said that this "shift in public opinion" is "very disturbing from the American point of view. Reflected in our allies abroad, it is even more disturbing." Therefore, it is not surprising that more and more people have been advocating that "the West cannot relax" these days.

Behind the Smoke Screen of Peace

Since the American ruling class is unwilling to see the easing of international tensions, why does it have to make gestures of willingness to ease international tensions? In September, the British "News Chronicle" published a commentary. Of course, the author of this commentary could not or was unwilling to point out that the fundamental reason is that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is increasingly overwhelming the imperialist camp headed by the United States in the overall balance of power, that is, the East wind is prevailing over the West wind. However, the author, who reflects the weapon-only viewpoint of Western politicians and military men, said something that makes sense: "Russia has not only broken the United States' monopoly in nuclear weapons, but it is now dangerously ahead in long-range and medium-range missiles," which is the reason "that causes the United States to adopt a new flexibility in foreign policy."

The fact is indeed the case. Due to the rapid development of the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, especially after the successful launch of three red space rockets, more and more people in the American military and political circles have admitted that the United States has lost its military advantage in maintaining its so-called "position of strength." They especially emphasized that the United States is far behind the Soviet Union in missile weapons. They advocated "catching up quickly," catching up with the Soviet Union, and revitalizing the declining military strength of the United States. For example, U.S. Democratic Senator and former Air Force Secretary Symington said that by 1961, the Soviet Union's strength in intercontinental missiles would be four times that of the United States. He demanded that a larger amount of military spending be allocated to develop new weapons, especially intercontinental missiles. U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman McCone also shouted that the United States must take urgent action to maintain its "nuclear leadership." The outgoing former Defense Secretary McElroy, even one minute before stepping down, unreservedly announced that the United States is striving to accelerate the development of missiles, "By 1963, the United States will be able to master more types of means of launching hydrogen warheads to deal with the Soviet Union."

These remarks clearly reflect the views of the American ruling class. Faced with the reality of the changing balance of world power, the American authorities have no intention of abandoning their policy of aggression and war, and plan to revitalize the United States' military decline by stepping up the pace of arms expansion. This attempt to buy time is already embodied in current U.S. policy. Regardless of the huge financial deficit this year, the Eisenhower administration has decided to continue to maintain a huge military expenditure of 41 billion US dollars in the next fiscal year, focusing on the development of missiles. The American authorities are accelerating the research and manufacture of various intercontinental missiles and medium-range missiles, while stepping up the expansion of its intercontinental missile squadrons and expanding its network of missile bases at home and abroad, especially in Western Europe, Asia, and Africa. Obviously, the United States is starting a new round of the arms race.

It can be seen from this that the so-called willingness to maintain peace and ease international tensions expressed by the American authorities is nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up the bankruptcy of the U.S. "position of strength" policy and the stepping up of arms expansion and war preparations.

Tightening the Strings in the Far East

People must have noticed the activities of the United States in the Far East and Asian regions in recent times.

Recently, the United States has been particularly committed to slanderous propaganda against the Chinese people. The U.S. State Department published a booklet on Taiwan on November 16th, reiterating that the United States insists on its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, insists on long-term occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, and creates "two Chinas." Recently, many American military leaders have arrived in Taiwan and allocated more weapons to the Chiang Kai-shek troops for use, conducting military exercises in the Taiwan Strait, and carrying out new war threats. The American authorities, who have been armed occupying Chinese territory of Taiwan and carrying out aggression around the world, shamelessly made a lot of noise, slandering China as "belligerent."

Provoking the relationship between Asian and African countries and China is the main policy of the United States in recent times. A reporter from the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" stationed in Washington recently revealed the current strategy of the United States, saying that the United States "currently wants to expand the image of Communist China into the 'number one bad guy in the world'," so as to "achieve results in grasping Asian public opinion." After the failure of smearing China's Great Leap Forward and People's Communes, American politicians and propaganda machines are now more focused on attacking China as "more aggressive and threatening," attempting to scare other Asian and African countries. The role of the United States as a provocateur in Sino-Indian relations is particularly blatant. On the one hand, it distorts the facts, slandering China for "carrying out aggression" against India, and on the other hand, it incites India to adopt a "firm attitude" and "strengthen military measures." The "New York Times" even openly demanded that India not adopt a "restrained" policy. The United States' conspiracy to sow discord is also being used in other Asian countries.

The United States' activities to intensify tensions in the Far East and Asian regions have been very active recently. In Southeast Asia, the United States continues to step up its conspiracy to interfere in Laos by embezzling the United Nations flag, and is currently making every effort to place a permanent United Nations agency serving it in Laos; at the same time, the military personnel and weapons the United States has transported into Laos and South Vietnam have continued to increase. In Northeast Asia, the United States is stepping up the piecing together of a Northeast Asian aggression group. A secret military conference held in Baguio, Philippines, on November 14th and 15th, convened by U.S. Pacific Area Armed Forces Commander Felt, with representatives from the Philippines, Japan, and the Chiang Kai-shek group, is closely related to this plan. In Japan, the United States is colluding with the Kishi government to prepare to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in mid-January next year, and Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama has even impatiently announced the aggressive essence of this U.S.-Japan military alliance against China and the Soviet Union. The United States has also recently conducted a series of separate or joint military exercises in the Pacific region, including large-scale missile exercises held in Okinawa. These facts show that the United States' activities to create tensions in the Far East have not been relaxed at all compared to the past. U.S. Pacific Army Commander White clamored in Taipei on November 16th: "The Cold War in Asia has not eased." He even openly threatened: "Hot war is not impossible," which truly reveals the United States' true intentions in the Far East at present.

In summary, people can clearly see that the certain peace gestures made by the United States recently are due to the increasingly obvious situation of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind," and the United States is facing the strong pressure of the people of the world demanding lasting peace, and has to change its methods of pursuing aggression and war policies. The United States is spreading a smokescreen of peace to confuse and paralyze the people of various countries, while continuing to carry out conspiracies against socialist countries, against national democratic movements, and against world peace. However, it can be asserted that this two-faced trick of the United States will not last long, because the thin smokescreen of peace will eventually not be able to cover up the activities of arms expansion and war preparations.

    半月国际述评
    十一月十六日至十二月四日
    美国总统艾森豪威尔已于12月3日晚上出国赴西欧、西亚、非洲等十一个国家进行为时将近二十天的所谓“亲善”访问。美国外交政策究竟怎么样？这是近来各国舆论的主要议题之一。
    谈缓和而搞紧张
    美国统治集团最近作出了一些愿意缓和国际紧张局势的姿态，把自己打扮成为“和平使者”，但是他们又唯恐这样做会产生不利的影响。因此当某些扮演红脸的人在高唱“和平”调子的时候，又有另外一些扮演白脸的人继续鼓吹“冷战”。
    近来美国一些负责官员和政客所发出的“冷战”叫嚣不但不比过去有所减少，而且更为频繁。像副总统尼克松、国务卿赫脱这样一些重要人物在一面侈谈和平的时候也一面不忘维护“冷战”。尼克松公开说：“西方国家不能接受苏联人所谓的和平共处。”赫脱再三强调军事准备对北大西洋公约国家的“重要性依然未变”。至于一向以鼓吹“冷战”著名的军政领袖如副国务卿狄龙、纽约州州长洛克菲勒、刚卸任的国防部长麦克耳罗伊、空军参谋长怀特、美国驻太平洋部队总司令费耳特、驻北大西洋集团常任代表伯吉斯之流就更不必说了。他们不放过任何一次机会叫嚷加紧备战，要求恢复核武器试验、发展导弹武器、扩充导弹基地、增加在国外驻军。从11月16日到20日在华盛顿举行的北大西洋公约组织议员会议第五届年会，成为美国煽动“冷战”的一个重要讲坛。美国的文武官员在国务卿赫脱的带头下，大肆散布反苏歇斯底里，鼓吹继续扩军和加强军事侵略集团。特别值得注意的是，在这个时候，像美国前总统杜鲁门、前国务卿艾奇逊等一些在野政客也急于出头露面，在鼓吹“冷战”的合唱中扮演重要角色。从所有这些富有代表性的人物的言论中，人们不难看出美国统治集团的那本“底账”里究竟是些什么样的货色。
    美国当局不仅没有停止“冷战”的叫嚷，而且到处积极干着加剧国际紧张局势的勾当。美国在联合国大会上就是做得相当露骨的。美国继策动讨论所谓“西藏问题”之后，又故意利用所谓“匈牙利问题”和“朝鲜问题”来对社会主义国家进行恶毒的诽谤和攻击，公然要继续干涉匈牙利的内政，拒绝从南朝鲜撤退侵略军队。美联社的新闻分析员罗伯茨也承认，美国是在联合国加紧“冷战”。
    “纽约时报”11月25日发表的该报不无名声的专栏作家苏兹贝格从华盛顿发出的一篇文章，是相当能够反映美国统治集团对国际局势缓和的担心的。苏兹贝格指出，美国的政策并没有变，变了的是舆论，这就是对苏联“抱有愈来愈大的好感”。他说，这种“舆论的转变”，“从美国来讲，这是十分令人不安的。反映在国外我们的盟国中间，这就更加令人不安”。因此，这些天来，越来越多的人在鼓吹“西方不能放松”，就毫不奇怪了。
    和平烟幕的背后
    美国的统治集团既然不愿意国际局势的缓和，为什么又偏要作出愿意缓和国际紧张局势的姿态呢？9月间英国“新闻纪事报”曾经发表过一篇评论，这篇评论的作者当然不可能或者不愿意指出根本原因是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在全盘力量的对比上正日甚一日地压倒以美国为首的帝国主义阵营，即东风压倒西风。但是，反映西方政客和军人们的唯武器论的观点的这位作者所说的这样的话是有道理的，他说；“俄国不仅打破了美国在核武器方面的垄断，而且它现在在远程和中程导弹方面危险地走到前面去了”，这是“使美国在外交政策方面采取新的灵活性”的原因。
    事实确是如此。由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量迅速发展，特别是三个红色宇宙火箭发射成功以后，美国的军政界中就有越来越多的人承认，美国已经丧失了它保持其所谓“实力地位”的军事优势。他们尤其强调美国在导弹武器方面远远落在苏联的后面。他们鼓吹“急起直追”，赶上苏联，重振美国一落千丈的军事力量。像美国民主党参议员、前空军部长薛明顿就说过，到1961年苏联在洲际导弹方面的力量将四倍于美国。他要求拨出更大数量的军事费用来发展新式武器，特别是洲际导弹。美国原子能委员会主席麦康也叫喊，美国必须以紧急行动来维持“核领导地位”。刚刚辞职的前国防部长麦克耳罗伊在下台前一分钟还毫不掩饰地宣布，美国正努力加速发展导弹，“到1963年美国将能掌握型式更多的投掷氢弹头的手段来对付苏联。”
    这些言论显然是反映了美国统治集团的意见。美国当局面对着世界力量对比变化的现实，无意放弃他们的侵略政策和战争政策，而且打算以加紧扩军的步伐来重振美国的军事颓势。这种争取时间的企图已经体现在美国目前的政策上。艾森豪威尔政府不顾今年出现的巨大财政赤字，已决定下一财政年度继续保持四百一十亿美元的庞大军事开支，而把重点放在发展导弹方面。美国当局正在一面加速研究和制造各种洲际导弹和中程导弹，一面加紧扩充它的洲际导弹中队和扩建它在国内外特别是在西欧、亚非地区的导弹基地网。很明显，美国正在开始军备竞赛的一个新的回合。
    由此可见，美国当局所表示的所谓愿意维护和平，愿意缓和国际紧张局势，完全不过是一种用来掩盖美国“实力地位”政策破产和加紧扩军备战的烟幕罢了。
    拉紧了远东的弦
    人们必定注意到，美国最近一个时期在远东和亚洲地区的活动。
    近来美国特别致力于对中国人民的诽谤宣传。美国国务院在11月16日发表了关于台湾的小册子，重申美国坚持敌视我国人民的政策不变，硬要长期霸占我国领土台湾，制造“两个中国”。近来美国的许多军事领袖纷纷到达台湾，并且把更多武器拨给蒋军使用，在台湾海峡举行军事演习，进行新的战争威胁。一直武装占领了中国领土台湾并在全世界进行侵略活动的美国当局，竟然恬不知耻地大放厥词，污蔑中国“好战”。
    挑拨亚非国家同我国之间的关系，是美国近来的主要方针。日本“朝日新闻”驻华盛顿的记者不久以前曾经透露美国当前的策略说，美国“在目前要把共产党中国的形象扩大成为‘世界上头号坏人’”，从而在“掌握亚洲舆论方面收到效果”。在对我国的大跃进和人民公社进行诬蔑失败以后，美国的政客和宣传机器现在更集中地攻击我国什么“更具侵略性和威胁性”，企图以此吓唬其他亚非国家。美国在中印关系上所扮演的挑拨者的角色是特别露骨的。它一边歪曲事实，诬蔑中国对印度“进行侵略”，一边煽动印度采取“坚定态度”、“加强军事措施”。“纽约时报”甚至公开要求印度不要采取“克制”政策。美国这种挑拨离间的阴谋，也在亚洲其他国家施展。
    美国最近在远东和亚洲地区的加剧紧张局势的活动是十分积极的。在东南亚，美国继续加紧进行盗用联合国旗帜干涉老挝的阴谋，目前正在竭力要在老挝安置一个替它服务的联合国常设机构；同时美国运进老挝和南越的军事人员和武器有增无已。在东北亚，美国正在加紧拼凑东北亚侵略集团。11月14日和15日在菲律宾的碧瑶由美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特召开的、有菲律宾、日本和蒋介石集团代表参加的一次秘密军事会议，同这个计划有密切的关系。在日本，美国勾结岸政府准备明年1月中旬修改日美“安全条约”，而日本外务相藤山甚至已经迫不及待地公开宣布这个美日军事同盟以中苏为敌的侵略实质。美国最近还在太平洋地区进行了一连串单独的或联合的军事演习，包括在冲绳岛举行的大规模导弹演习。这些事实表明，美国在远东制造紧张局势的活动，丝毫没有比过去稍为放松。美国太平洋陆军总司令怀特11月16日在台北叫嚷说：“亚洲的冷战并未松弛”。他甚至公然恫吓：“热战并非不可能”，这正道出了美国目前在远东的真心实意。
    综上所述，人们就可以很清楚地看出，美国最近所作的某些和平姿态，是由于“东风压倒西风”的形势日益明显，美国面对着全世界人民要求持久和平的强大压力，而不得不变换推行侵略和战争政策的手法。美国正在一面散布和平的烟幕来迷惑和麻痹各国人民，一面继续进行敌视社会主义国家、敌视民族民主运动、敌视世界和平的阴谋活动。但是，可以断言，美国的这种两面把戏是耍不久的，因为稀薄的和平烟幕终究遮掩不住扩军备战的勾当的。
