This newspaper reports: Nanning, December 2nd – In Xincheng County, Guangxi, one can see scenes of bountiful harvests in every season, along with busy cultivation and planting.

In early November, this reporter visited the county. The mid-season rice had already been harvested. Along the way, countless Zhuang women and children carried bamboo baskets, harvesting late corn in the fields. In the fields cleared of corn, beneath the dry, yellow corn stalks, a sea of white flowers swayed in the wind – autumn buckwheat, which was also nearing maturity. On the hills, laughter and singing could be heard amidst the greenery, as primary school students harvested cat beans.

Xincheng County, a place once known for its "barren land," has now become a paradise of year-round harvests. Whether on mountain tops, riverbanks, beside houses, or along roadsides, there are melons, beans, vegetables, and grains everywhere. The county Party secretary told the reporter that they had already harvested early rice, mid-season rice, early corn, spring sweet potatoes, pumpkins, cassava, and spring buckwheat in the summer; now they are harvesting late rice, cat beans, and miscellaneous beans; and there are hundreds of thousands of mu of autumn buckwheat, sorghum, millet, and sweet potatoes in the fields; and now they are planting barley, wheat, rapeseed, peas, and four-season sweet potatoes. This is a new phenomenon that has emerged after the implementation of the new planting system of "one plot of land, multiple uses, one plot of land, multiple harvests." Because there is planting and harvesting in every season, the county's total grain output has increased unprecedentedly: the total grain output for the whole year has increased by 60% compared with last year, and it has already overfulfilled the annual grain procurement task by 30%.

Xincheng County is a region with many rocky mountains and little land. The county's cultivated land area is only 400,000 mu, but this year's multiple cropping area has reached more than 990,000 mu. This is the result of the Xincheng County Party Committee's in-depth summary of the experience of multiple cropping and intercropping in several communes and brigades on the south bank of the Honghe River, and vigorously promoting it. For example, after the county Party committee put forward the instruction to make full use of the land for intercropping and interplanting, Longguang Commune fought day and night, planting 2,500 mu of cat beans in three days, and intercropping and interplanting a total of 21 kinds of crops, including soybeans, millet, millet, cassava, and taro, increasing the planting area of food crops from more than 13,000 mu to 42,000 mu.

After a year of intercropping and interplanting measures, the people of Xincheng County have undergone fundamental changes, and the so-called "spring famine" and "lean season" will be a thing of the past.

### 一地多用季季丰收  忻城县推行套种间作增加复种指数粮食增产六成

    一地多用季季丰收
    忻城县推行套种间作增加复种指数粮食增产六成
    本报南宁2日电　在广西忻城县，无论那一个季节，都可以看到丰收的情景，同时也会看到繁忙的耕种和播种。
    11月初，记者访问了这个县，这时中稻已经收完毕。一路上，数不尽的僮族妇女和儿童，背着竹箩，在地里收晚玉米。在收完玉米的地里，枯黄的玉米叶秆下，一片白花迎风摇动，那是秋荞麦，眼看也要成熟了。山岭上，万绿丛中不时传出笑声、歌声，那是小学生们在收获猫豆。
    忻城县，这个过去所谓“土地贫瘠”的地方，现在却成为四季丰收的乐园。不论是山顶、河岸、屋旁、路边，到处是瓜豆菜粮。县委书记告诉记者，这里夏季已经收获了早稻、中稻、早玉米、春红薯、南瓜、木薯、春荞麦等；现在正在收晚稻、猫豆、杂豆等；还有几十万亩秋荞麦、高粱、?子、红薯在地里；现在又在种大麦、小麦、油菜、菀豆、四季红薯等。这是实行“一地多用、一地多收”的新的种植制度之后出现的新气象。由于季季有种，季季有收，全县粮食产量空前增长：今年全年粮食产量，比去年增长60％，已经超额30％完成了全年的粮食征购任务。
    忻城县是一个石山多，土地少的地区。全县耕地面积不过四十万亩，而今年复播面积却达到九十九万多亩。这是由于忻城县县委深入总结了红河南岸几个公社和大队复种、套种的经验，并大力加以推广的结果。仅隆光公社在县委提出充分利用土地间种、套种的指示后，全社日夜奋战，三天种下了猫豆二千五百亩，间种、套种黄豆、小米、?子、木薯、芋头等共二十一种，粮食作物种植面积由一万三千多亩提高到四万二千亩。
    忻城县的人民，经过这一年的套种、间作措施后，面貌起了根本的变化，历来所谓的“春荒”、“青黄不接”，将一去不返了。
