Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 8th: While vigorously engaging in winter water conservancy construction, the people of Gansu are also launching large-scale, high-standard soil and water conservation activities in the basins of one river (the Bailong River) and ten rivers (the Yellow River, Wei River, Jing River, Tao River, Datong River, Daxia River, Hei River, Shule River, Shiyang River, and Zuli River) throughout the province. The key projects of this activity include 513 projects such as Dongzhi Yuan, Chedao Ridge, Flame Mountain, Linxia North Mountain, and the North and South Mountains of Lanzhou.

In the course of governance, all localities have implemented the principle of combining biological measures (planting trees and grass) with engineering measures, combining large, medium, and small-scale projects, and combining the governance of the plains, slopes, and gullies. They are building terraces on slopes, constructing flatlands in gullies, striving to irrigate all arable land, and planting trees extensively on mountains. In order to accelerate the progress of construction, various localities have launched a high-efficiency movement centered on tool reform. At present, the average daily area of soil erosion control in the province has increased from more than 700 square kilometers in October to more than 1,000 square kilometers.

Gansu is located on the Loess Plateau, with undulating hills and crisscrossing gullies, resulting in extremely serious soil erosion. Every year, 450 million tons of sediment are carried into the Yellow River. In the past, people described this place as "turbid currents rolling out of the mountain gorges, thousands of gullies and valleys transporting sediment; upstream erosion silting up downstream, water and drought disasters causing devastation to families." After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, people began to organize themselves to manage the mountains and rivers, storing floodwaters and retaining sediment, and have achieved certain successes. This year, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the favorable situation after the people's communization, decided to launch a mass movement this winter and next spring to step up soil and water conservation work in order to store water and conserve moisture, and ensure a good harvest next year; at the same time, reduce the Yellow River sediment and increase the benefits of the Sanmenxia project.

    全面规划  综合利用  建立完整的水利系统
    坡地改梯田　沟壑改川台　耕地有水灌　山上多种树
    甘肃全面治理一江十河
    新华社兰州8日电　甘肃人民在大力冬修水利的同时，在全省一江（白龙江）十河（黄河、渭河、泾河、洮河、大通河、大夏河、黑河、疏勒河、石羊河、祖历河）流域展开了大规模、高标准的水土保持活动。这一活动的重点工程有董志塬、车道岭、火焰山、临夏北山、兰州市南北山等五百一十三个。
    各地在治理中都贯彻了生物措施（植树种草）与工程措施相结合、大中小型工程相结合、治塬治坡治沟相结合的方针，在坡地上兴修梯田，在沟壑中兴修川台，耕地都力争做到有水灌溉，在山上大量植树造林。为了加速施工进度，各地开展了以工具改革为中心的高工效运动。目前全省平均每天治理的水土流失面积，已从10月间的七百多平方公里增加到一千多平方公里。
    甘肃地处黄土高原，境内丘陵起伏，沟壑纵横，水土流失极为严重，每年输入黄河的泥沙达四亿五千万吨。过去，人们形容这里是“浊流滚滚出山峡，千沟万壑输泥沙；上游冲刷下游淤，水旱灾害祸万家”。解放后，在党的领导下人们开始组织起来治理山河，蓄洪拦泥，已经获得了一定成就。今年，中共甘肃省委根据人民公社化以后的有利形势，决定今冬明春大搞群众运动，加紧开展水土保持工作，以便蓄水保墒，保证明年丰收；同时，减少黄河流沙，增大三门峡工程的效益。（附图片）
