A Leaf and a Stalk, Hard-Earned
Some people think that "once the cabbage is in the cellar, everything is fine." This is wrong. The fact that some vegetable storage units in the suburbs of Beijing are experiencing spoilage tells us that if they are not properly stored, they will be lost.

This year's Chinese cabbage has achieved a great harvest, which is the fruit of the suburban farmers' efforts in the face of continuous heavy rain and repeated floods. A leaf and a stalk, hard-earned; the Chinese cabbage stored by various units will mostly be eaten until March or April next year, so it is necessary to plan for consumption and take care in storage. That is to say, first, "live a rich life as if it were a poor one," pay attention to saving, and overcome waste; second, organize special personnel to be responsible for the storage of Chinese cabbage. If planning is poor and storage is inadequate, a year of vegetable harvest can turn into a year of vegetable shortage.

    一帮一叶，来之不易
    有人认为“白菜入窖、万事大吉”，这是不对的。北京城郊各区检查一些贮菜单位坏菜的事实告诉我们，保管不好，就要损失。
    今年的大白菜获得了很大的丰收，这是郊区农民在连天大雨、几冲几种的情况下夺得的丰收果实。一帮一叶，来之不易；各单位贮藏的大白菜，又大都要吃到明年三、四月，因此，一定要做到计划吃菜，细心保管。这就是说，第一，“富日子要当穷日子过”，注意节约，克服浪费；第二，要组织专人负责做好大白菜的保管工作。如果计划不好，保管不好，蔬菜丰收年也会变成缺菜年。
