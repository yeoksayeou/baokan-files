Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, December 15th: Following a meeting on the 14th between U.S. President Eisenhower and Iranian King Pahlavi, a joint communique was issued touting the importance of the Central Treaty Organization, a military aggression bloc. The communique stated that Eisenhower and Pahlavi "both emphasized the importance of the Central Treaty Organization in maintaining stability and security in this region." The communique also said, "They reaffirmed their governments' determination to support the Central Treaty Organization." The communique also emphasized the "beneficial role" of bilateral U.S.-Iran military agreements.

The communique said Eisenhower and Pahlavi "studied the world situation." They "exchanged views on various issues, especially those related to the Middle East." The communique stated that Eisenhower acknowledged Iran's "significant contribution" to "stabilizing" the situation in the Middle East, an important region, and expressed "admiration" for the "heroic stance" taken by the Iranian government in dealing with so-called "external pressures." The communique said, "For the common interests of both countries, the United States is willing to continue to assist Iran."

The communique blatantly reveals that Eisenhower, who constantly talked about peace during his trip, is actually working hard to incite the ruling forces of countries participating in military aggression blocs to maintain a tense, anti-peace stance.

During his brief stay in Tehran, Eisenhower also delivered a speech to the Iranian Parliament. In his speech, he blatantly hyped the Cold War. He said, "The world struggle we are engaged in is multifaceted. On the one hand, it is an ideological, political, and military struggle; on the other hand, it is both a spiritual and an economic struggle." He praised Iran for "not standing idly by" in this struggle and reiterated that "we cannot abandon the joint efforts of the Central Treaty Organization to deal with the continuing dangers of aggression and subversion."

Eisenhower arrived in Tehran on the morning of the 14th from New Delhi. He only stayed in Tehran for five hours before hurriedly flying to Athens.

    艾森豪威尔访问伊朗
    鼓吹军事集团的重要性
    新华社15日讯　德黑兰消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔和伊朗国王巴列维在14日会谈后发表的联合公报，鼓吹中央条约组织这一军事侵略集团的重要性。公报说，艾森豪威尔和巴列维“两人强调了中央条约组织在维护这一地区稳定和安全方面的重要性”。公报还说，“他们重申他们的政府决心支持中央条约组织”。公报并强调了美伊双边军事协定的“有益作用”。
    公报说，艾森豪威尔和巴列维“研究了世界局势”。他们“就各项问题、特别是有关中东的各项问题交换了意见”。公报说，艾森豪威尔确认伊朗在“稳定”中东这一重要地区的局势方面所作出的“重大贡献”，并且表示“钦佩”伊朗政府在对付所谓“外界压力”时采取的“英勇立场”。公报说，“为了两国共同利益，美国愿意继续援助伊朗”。
    公报露骨地表明，在旅行中不断谈论和平的艾森豪威尔，实际上是在努力鼓动参加军事侵略集团的各国统治势力继续保持紧张局势的反和平立场。
    艾森豪威尔在德黑兰的短暂停留期间，还在伊朗议会上发表了演说。他在演说中露骨地鼓吹冷战。他说，“我们所从事的世界斗争是多方面的。一方面，这是思想、政治和军事斗争；另外一些方面，这既是精神斗争，又是经济斗争。”他赞扬伊朗在这一斗争中“并未袖手旁观”，并且再次强调“不能放弃中央条约组织对付侵略和颠覆的持续危险而作的共同努力”。
    艾森豪威尔是在14日上午从新德里到达德黑兰的。他在德黑兰只停留了五小时，又匆匆乘机前往雅典。
