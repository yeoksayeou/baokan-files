　　Pig Manure is a Good Fertilizer
　　Xi Chengfan, Deputy Leader of the Soil Team, Chinese Academy of Sciences
　　Farmers often say, "Land fertilized with pig manure has great vigor." Those who grow crops have this experience. This year, when the Soil Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences cooperated with relevant units of the Academy to study organic fertilizers, they compared the nutrient content of various farmyard manures, and the results were in line with practical production experience. No matter which aspect of its nature is considered, pig manure is of the best quality. In terms of nutrient content: the nitrogen content of pig manure is 1.56% to 2.96%, which is several times higher than that of horse manure and cow manure. Compared with sheep manure, although the content is comparable, the carbon-nitrogen ratio of sheep manure is wide (high carbon, low nitrogen), and the nitrogen in sheep manure is released more slowly than in pig manure. The carbon-nitrogen ratio of cattle and horse manure is even wider (high carbon, even lower nitrogen), and nitrogen is released even more slowly. Among them, cow manure is the slowest. These slow-release fertilizers need to be well rotted before they can release nitrogen. From Table 1, it can be seen that the fiber decomposition nitrogen and hydrolyzable nitrogen contained in pig manure are higher than other fertilizers. These components come from the decomposition of fiber and the hydrolysis of proteins and amino acids. This shows that pig manure not only has a high nitrogen content, but also a high level of fast-acting nutrients, which are quickly absorbed and utilized by crops, resulting in an obvious fertilizer effect and great vigor.

　　Table 1: Comparison of nutrient content of pig manure with other manures (%)
　　　　　　Pig manure　　Sheep manure　　Horse manure　　Cow manure　　Peat
　　Total Nitrogen　1.56—2.96　1.22—2.35　0.66—1.22　0.69—0.84　0.54
　　Total Phosphorus　0.40　0.18　0.08　0.22　0.08
　　Total Potassium　2.08　2.13　2.07　2.00　——
　　Fiber Decomposition Nitrogen　0.50　0.44　0.32　0.21　——
　　Hydrolyzed Nitrogen　0.24　0.18　0.22　0.03　——
　　Carbon-Nitrogen Ratio　7.14　12.30　13.40　21.50

　　From the analysis results, it is also known that the potassium content in pig manure is comparable to other farmyard manures. However, in terms of phosphorus content, it is twice as high as cow and sheep manure, and much higher than horse manure. We know that the phosphorus in organic fertilizers is all organic phosphorus, and its fertilizer effect is better than superphosphate. After the application of superphosphate, the large amount of lime in the northern soil fixes the phosphate to form insoluble compounds; the southern soil contains a lot of iron and phosphorus combined to form iron phosphate precipitates, which greatly reduces the utilization rate of phosphorus. Pig manure contains organic phosphorus, which is less likely to be fixed. Relatively, it improves the fertilizer efficiency of phosphate fertilizer, and the result is that the crops have full grains after applying pig manure fertilizer.
    Farmers often say that pig manure has a high oil content. From the table below, it can be seen that the fat content in pig manure accounts for 11.42% of the total carbon content, which is higher than that of sheep, cattle, and horse manure. More fat means higher oil content. High oil content has two benefits. It can form a lot of anti-capillary water, reduce the evaporation of surface soil moisture, and enhance the water retention capacity of the soil. Another benefit is that dead soil becomes oily soil. Pig manure forms a lot of high-quality humic acid after rotting, and the humus content is high (26%), which is of great benefit to the formation of good soil structure, containing water, regulating soil moisture, increasing absorption exchange, and conserving fertilizer nutrients. From long-term production practice, farmers call soil with high maturity, high fertility, loose texture, and good structure as oily soil. Long-term and large-scale application of organic fertilizer can just accelerate the soil to become oily. Applying more high-quality fertilizers such as pig manure can speed up the transformation of raw soil into living soil, and living soil into oily soil. For example, originally saline-alkali soil, after applying pig manure for two or three years, can change the soil quality and reach the level of 200 jin of wheat per mu.

    Table 2: Organic matter composition of pig manure and other farmyard manures (percentage of carbon)
    　　　　　　Lipid Wax　　Total Humus　　Humic Acid　　Fulvic Acid　　Hemicellulose
    　　Pig manure　11.42　25.98　10.22　15.78　5.32
    　　Sheep manure　11.35　24.79　7.54　17.25　3.85
    　　Cow manure　6.05　23.80　9.05　14.74　9.94
    　　Horse manure　8.00　23.60　13.95　9.88　6.42

    Another benefit of pig manure fertilizer is that it forms a higher amount of humic acid after rotting. This is a high-molecular-weight organic compound formed by microbial condensation. The soil has a good aggregate structure, which is entirely dependent on it playing a leading role. This high-molecular-weight compound releases energy during the conversion process, which can stimulate the crop roots to absorb more nutrients. Experiments have proven that humic acid in organic fertilizers has a stimulating effect on the absorption of inorganic nutrients by crops, which can promote the large amount of inorganic nutrients entering the plant, making the crops grow tall and produce more grains. The high-energy compounds contained in pig manure, taking the carboxyl group as an example, are 460 milligram equivalents per 100 grams. While horse manure only has 400, and cow manure only has 380. This shows that pig manure has a high exchange capacity, which can conserve more nutrients, enhance soil activity, and increase fertility. This fully shows that pig manure not only has a high fertilizer content, but also can promote a large amount of inorganic fertilizer to enter the plant. Pig manure not only directly supplies a large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, but also has the effect of stimulating plants to absorb a large amount of inorganic nutrients. These properties are beyond the reach of chemical fertilizers.
    Each pig can produce an average of 3,400 jin to 4,000 jin of manure fertilizer per year. If composted with soil in a 1:1 ratio, it can produce 6,000 to 7,000 jin of refined fertilizer. This is a first-class high-quality fertilizer. If composted in a 1:2 ratio, it can also produce 10,000 jin of fertilizer. Experimental results have proven that applying 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu can maintain a bulk density of 1.14-1.260 in the soil, and can maintain a porosity of about 50%, that is, maintain the physical characteristics of fertile soil. From the perspective of nutrients, if the soil is regularly maintained with about 5 mg of hydrolyzable nitrogen, it can meet the needs of crop high yield. Such a level of fertilization, coupled with deep plowing of one foot to one and a half feet, and combined with measures such as water, seed, density, protection, management, and engineering, the crop harvest can be guaranteed. If we can seize the opportunity to topdress chemical fertilizers on this basis, the yield can be even higher. Under the leadership of the Party, the pig raising industry will surely have a great development in the future. The goal of one pig per person and one pig per mu can definitely be achieved. Organic fertilizer is originally the essence of the production experience of our working people for thousands of years, and pig manure is especially superior among them. We should strengthen the preservation of so much high-quality pig manure, pay attention to composting and refining techniques, and appropriately mix it with other chemical fertilizers to prepare higher-quality fertilizers, so as to ensure that grain and cotton production will increase again and again.

　　猪粪是好肥料
　　中国科学院土壤队副队长　席承藩
    农民常说：“地施猪粪劲头大”。种庄稼的人都有这个体会。中国科学院土壤队今年与本院有关单位配合研究有机肥料时，对比了各种厩肥的养分含量，结果与生产实践经验正相符合。无论从哪方面的性质来看，猪粪的质量最好。就养分含量来说：猪粪的含氮量为1.56％到2.96％，比马粪、牛粪高出数倍，和羊粪相比，虽然含量不相上下，但羊粪的碳氮比值宽（含碳多、含氮少），羊粪中的氮比猪粪放出来的慢。牛、马粪的碳氮比值更宽（含碳多，含氮更少），氮素放出来的更慢。其中以牛粪为最慢。这些慢性肥料，要经过好好腐熟，才能放出氮素来。从表1中可以看出猪粪中所含的纤维分解氮与水解性氮都比其他肥料为高。这些成分是从分解纤维，水解蛋白质、胺基酸而来的。这说明猪粪不仅含氮量高，而且速效养分高，很快为作物吸收利用，肥效明显，劲头儿大。
　　表1：　猪粪养分含量与其他粪肥的比较（％）
　　猪粪　　羊粪　　马粪　　牛粪　　泥炭
　　全氮  1.56—2.96  1.22—2.35  0.66—1.22  0.69—0.84  0.54
　　全磷  0.40  0.18  0.08  0.22  0.08
　　全钾  2.08  2.13  2.07  2.00  ——
　　纤维分解氮  0.50  0.44  0.32  0.21  ——
　　水解氮  0.24  0.18  0.22  0.03  ——
　　碳氮比  7.14  12.30  13.40  21.50
    从分析结果，也知道猪粪中钾的含量和其他厩肥不相上下。不过从磷的含量来看，比牛粪、羊粪高出一倍，比马粪高出很多。我们知道有机肥料中的磷都是有机磷，它的肥效特性比过磷酸钙好。施用过磷酸钙后，北方土壤中的大量石灰质，把磷酸固定形成不溶性化合物；南方土壤含很多的铁和磷酸化合形成磷酸铁沉淀下来，这些都大大降低了磷的利用率。猪粪所含的是有机磷，被固定的可能性少。相对地提高了磷肥肥效，反应出来的结果是施猪粪肥后作物结子饱满。
    农民常说猪粪的油性大。从下表中可看出猪粪中脂肪质含量占全碳量的11.42％，比羊、牛、马粪都高。脂肪质多就是油性大。油性大有两个好处，它可以形成很多反毛管水，减低了表层土壤水分的蒸发，使土壤的保水力增强。另一个好处是死土变油土。猪粪腐熟后形成很多优质的腐殖酸，腐殖质含量较高（26％），对土壤形成良好结构，含蓄水分，调节土壤水分，增进吸收代换量，保蓄肥分养分，都大有好处。农民从长期生产实践中，称熟化度高、肥力高、疏松，结构好的土壤为油土。长期大量施用有机肥料，正好能加速土壤变油。多施猪肥等优质肥料，更能尽快地把生土变活土，活土变油土。像本来是盐碱土的，施用猪粪二、三年后，就可以改变土质，达到亩产小麦二百斤的水平。
    表2：　猪粪与其他厩肥有机质组成（占碳的百分数）
    脂腊质    总腐殖质    胡敏酸    富啡酸    半纤维
    猪粪  11.42  25.98  10.22  15.78  5.32
    羊粪  11.35  24.79  7.54  17.25  3.85
    牛粪  6.05  23.80  9.05  14.74  9.94
    马粪  8.00  23.60  13.95  9.88  6.42
    猪粪肥料的好处还在于它腐熟后，形成较高量的胡敏酸。这是经微生物缩合而成的高分子状态的有机化合物。土壤有良好的团粒构造，全靠它起主导作用。这种高分子化合物在转化过程中放出能量，就能刺激作物根多吸收养分。试验证明，有机肥料中的胡敏酸，对作物吸收无机养分，有刺激作用，能促进无机养分大量进入植物体，使庄稼长得株高籽多。猪粪中所含的高能量的化合物，以羧基为例，是一百克中为四百六十毫克当量。而马粪只有四百，牛粪只有三百八十。说明猪粪具有高的交换量，可以更多地保蓄养分，使土壤的活性增强，肥力增高。这充分说明，猪粪不仅本身肥分高，还能促进无机肥料大量进入植物体。猪粪不仅直接供给大量的氮、磷、钾，还有刺激植物大量吸收无机养分的作用。这些性质都是化学肥料所不能及的。
    每一头猪，一年平均可产粪肥三千四百斤至四千斤。如以粪一土一作堆肥，可制六七千斤精肥。这是头等优质肥料。如以一比二作堆肥，也可作万斤肥料。试验结果证明，亩施万斤基肥，能保持土壤1.14—1.260的容积比重，能保持50％左右的孔隙度，即保持了丰产土壤的物理特性。从养分来看，如果经常使土壤保持约五毫克的水解性氮，就能满足作物丰产的需要。这样的施肥水平，加上深耕一尺至一点五尺，并与水、种、密、保、管、工等措施相结合，作物丰收即可得到保证。如能在这个基础上掌握时机，追施化学肥料，产量还可更高。在党的领导下，今后养猪业一定有一个大发展。每人一头猪，每亩一头猪的目标一定可以实现。有机肥料本来就是我国劳动人民几千年来生产经验的精华，猪粪在其中尤属上乘。对这么多上等肥料的猪粪，应加强保藏，讲究堆制、精制技术，并适当混合其他化学肥料，配制质量更高的优质肥料，保证粮棉增产再增产。
