Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 15th. The hundreds of thousands of Tibetan farmers on the Tibetan Plateau, having destroyed the feudal serf system and obtained their first harvest belonging to themselves this year, are, under the leadership of the Party, launching a winter production movement focused on winter plowing, fertilizer accumulation, seed selection, water conservancy repairs, and the repair and improvement of agricultural tools, striving for an even greater agricultural harvest next year. Now, across the thousands of miles of the Tibetan countryside, there is a new scene of busy production everywhere. The tragic situation of desolate rural production every winter for so many years has gone forever. Farmers in Gongbujiangda County sing, "Busy in the past, busy this year, this year is not the same as the past; in the past, hard work left hands empty, this year, hard work fills the granaries!"

To strive for a greater harvest next year, farmers in various places began plowing during the autumn harvest. In the main agricultural areas of Tibet, the Shannan and Lhasa regions, nearly one million mu of cultivated land in the twenty counties under their jurisdiction have mostly been plowed twice, and some have been plowed three times. In the past, plowing was only three or four inches deep, but this year some places have plowed to a depth of five to seven inches. In many counties, districts, and townships, the plowing of land has generally reached 60% to 70% or more of the total cultivated area. Mules, horses, and yaks, which for thousands of years were only used for riding or carrying loads, have now been trained to plow. The superstition that "women plowing will result in poor crops" has been broken, and some Tibetan women are starting to go into the fields to hold the plow. In Yangda Township in the western suburbs of Lhasa, twenty-seven women have learned to plow with new-style walking plows, and they have also proposed to compete with men in winter plowing.

Because farmers in various places, under the leadership of the Party, actively organize production mutual aid and rationally arrange manpower, animal power, and agricultural tools, this year's winter plowing work across the region is progressing faster and with better quality than in any year in Tibetan history. In the past, serfs had to first plow the lord's self-operated land, and by the time the serfs could plow their own corvée land or rented land, it was already frozen. Therefore, the land cultivated by serfs in exchange for heavy corvée labor and rent tribute was rarely winter-plowed, or could only be plowed coarsely.

After being freed from personal dependence and becoming masters of the land, the vast number of farmers have unleashed infinite enthusiasm and wisdom in production. While winter plowing, they are also carrying out a fertilizer accumulation and production movement. The fertilizer accumulated by farmers in many counties, districts, and townships has exceeded several times that of previous years. Places that never used fertilizer in the past are now starting to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. "Comparing manure piles this year, comparing grain piles next year" has become the action slogan of farmers in many areas. For many years, garbage, sludge, manure, animal bones, etc., scattered in rural areas and towns have been used by people to ferment fertilizer, and the rural environment has been completely renewed. Farmers in the Shannan area have accumulated more than 1 billion jin of fertilizer, averaging more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer per person. In counties such as Naidong, Zhalang, Linzhi, Qushui, Nimu, Dazi, and Mozhugongka, some districts and townships have formed a fertilizer accumulation competition movement with every household mobilized and everyone participating, digging manure pools, building toilets, and widely opening up sources of fertilizer. Zhalang County organized a fertilizer accumulation army of more than 5,000 people to produce fertilizer. Now, the county has basically achieved every family having a manure pool and every household having a toilet.

The Tibetan Plateau is rich in water resources, and rural canals crisscross, but under the serf system, these canals were mainly used to irrigate the manorial lord's self-operated land, and the land cultivated by serfs could not be irrigated in a timely and sufficient manner. Since the rebellion was quelled and it was announced that "whoever cultivates the land of the rebellious lords this year will reap the harvest," and "rent reduction for the land of the non-rebellious lords this year," farmers in various places have actively repaired the original canals, negotiated and coordinated irrigation, and ensured this year's increase in production. Since the autumn harvest, Tibetan farmers, with even more abundant production enthusiasm, have begun to comprehensively repair old canals, build new canals, and dig reservoirs in an organized manner under the leadership of farmers' associations. Some counties and districts have specially organized canal repair teams or shock brigades to speed up the construction day and night, so that water conservancy work and winter plowing and fertilizer accumulation can advance simultaneously. Counties such as Naidong, Mozhugongka, and Zhalang have built new canals tens of miles long. The seven new canals built in Zhalang County can irrigate 20,000 mu of land. The western suburbs of Lhasa have used repaired and newly built canals to irrigate more than 50,000 mu of land in the entire area once again after the second plowing. In order to help farmers solve irrigation problems, the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is leading farmers in the suburbs to build two trunk canals more than thirty kilometers long and more than eighty branch canals to draw water from the Lhasa River to irrigate the suburban land. Tibetan, Han, and Hui cadres from the Tibet Work Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and various departments in Lhasa have participated in voluntary labor to help farmers repair canals.

Production tools that have been in disrepair for years have now been restored and put back into production. The more than 300,000 new-style seven-inch walking plows and other iron agricultural tools that the state has distributed free of charge over the past few years have also been put into use. Farmers in various places are also actively improving and creating new agricultural tools. Some iron and wood factories serving production have been established in the Shannan area. Some counties and districts have organized blacksmiths, carpenters, and stonemasons to rush to produce new plowshares, plow handles, trolleys, pack frames, axles, stone rollers, etc., and repair old agricultural tools. Some counties have also established small agricultural tool manufacturing plants or production workshops. (Attached picture)

### 往年辛劳两手光　今年辛劳粮满仓  西藏农民狠抓冬季生产

    往年辛劳两手光　今年辛劳粮满仓
    西藏农民狠抓冬季生产
    新华社拉萨15日电　西藏高原上的几十万藏族农民，在摧毁了封建农奴制度和获得今年首次属于自己的丰收以后，正在党的领导下，掀起一个以冬耕、积肥、选种、整修水利和修补、改良农具为主要内容的冬季生产运动，争取明年农业更大的丰收。现在，纵横几千里的西藏农村到处是生产繁忙的新景象。多少年来，每年冬季农村生产萧条的悲惨情景已经一去不返了。工布江达县的农民唱道：“往年忙、今年忙，今年往年不一样，往年辛劳两手光，今年辛劳啊粮食堆满仓。”
    为争取明年更大丰收，各地农民在秋收时就开始翻地。西藏主要农业区的山南地区和拉萨地区所属的二十个县，近一百万亩耕地已大部翻过两遍，有的已翻了三遍，往年翻地只有三、四寸深，今年有些地方已深耕到五至七寸。许多县、区、乡，翻耕的土地一般也已达到总耕地面积的60％到70％以上。千百年来只供骑用或驮运的骡、马、牦牛，现在已被训练来犁地。“妇女犁地庄稼长不好”的迷信破除了，一些藏族妇女开始下田扶犁。拉萨西郊区羊达乡有二十七个妇女学会用新式步犁耕地，她们还提出要在冬耕中和男人竞赛。
    由于各地农民在党的领导下积极组织生产互助，合理地安排了人力、畜力与农具，今年全区的冬耕工作，比西藏历史上任何一年都进行得快而且质量好。往年，农奴必须首先翻完领主的自营地，等到农奴可以耕犁自己的差地或租地时就已经封冻，因此农奴以沉重的乌拉差役和租贡换来耕种的土地很少冬耕，或只能粗糙地耕一下。
    在解除了人身依附和成为土地的主人以后，广大农民在生产上发挥了无穷的干劲和智慧。他们在冬耕的同时，还开展了积肥造肥运动，许多县、区、乡农民所积肥料已超过往年的好几倍，过去从不施肥的地方，现在也开始大量积贮肥料。“今年比粪堆，明年比粮堆”，已经成为许多地区农民的行动口号。多年来散积在农村和城镇里的垃圾、污泥、粪便、兽骨等，都被人们用来沤制肥料，农村环境卫生焕然一新。山南地区农民已经积肥十多亿斤，平均每人积肥万斤以上。在乃东、扎朗、林芝、曲水、尼木、达孜、墨竹工卡等县，有些区、乡已形成户户齐动员、人人都动手的积肥竞赛运动，挖粪池、修厕所，广泛开辟肥源。扎朗县组织了一支五千多人的积肥大军积造肥料，现在全县已基本上达到家家有粪池、户户有厕所。
    西藏高原上水源丰富，农村水渠纵横，但在农奴制度下，这些水渠都主要用来灌溉农奴主的自营地，农奴耕种的土地不能得到及时和充分的灌溉。自从叛乱平息，并宣布了对叛乱领主的土地今年实行“谁种谁收”，对未叛乱领主的土地今年实行减租后，各地农民就积极整修了原有水渠，互相协商调剂灌溉，保证了今年的增产。秋收以来，生产热情更加充沛的藏族农民，在农会领导下，有组织地开始普遍整修旧水渠、增修新水渠和开挖蓄水池。有的县区专门组织了修渠队或突击队，日夜加紧赶修，使水利工作与冬耕积肥同时并进。乃东、墨竹工卡、扎朗等县都修了长达几十里的新水渠，扎朗县新修的七条水渠能灌溉二万亩土地。拉萨西郊区利用整修和新修的水渠，已将全区五万余亩土地，在深耕第二遍后又普遍浇灌了一次水。中共拉萨市委为了帮助农民解决灌溉问题，正领导郊区农民修筑两条长达三十多公里的干渠和八十多条支渠，引拉萨河水灌溉郊区土地。中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹委会和拉萨市各机关的藏、汉、回族干部，纷纷参加义务劳动，帮助农民修渠。
    过去年久失修的生产工具，现在又重新修复投入了生产，国家几年来无偿发放的三十多万件新式的七寸步犁和其他铁质农具，也已运用到生产中去。各地农民还积极改良和创造新的农具，山南地区已经成立了一些为生产服务的铁木工厂，有些县、区已把铁、木、石匠组织起来，赶制新犁尖、犁杖、推车、驮架、车轴、石滚等和修理旧农具，有的县还成立了小型农具制造所或生产作坊。（附图片）
