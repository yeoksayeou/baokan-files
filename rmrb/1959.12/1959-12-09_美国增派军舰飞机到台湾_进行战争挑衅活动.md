Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Taipei dispatch: The United States has recently dispatched warships and aircraft to Taiwan in succession, engaging in war provocation activities.

	The flagship "Bremerton" of the U.S. Navy cruiser squadron arrived at Keelung Port in Taiwan on the 7th, carrying out war intimidation under the guise of being "open for visits". This U.S. warship came from the eastern United States, arriving at Kaohsiung Port in Taiwan on the 3rd, transferring to Magong Port in Penghu on the 5th, and then to Keelung. The U.S. military stated that the "open for visits" of this heavy cruiser in Taiwan and Penghu is intended to "hopefully provide a greater understanding of the U.S. Navy through this visit".

	A batch of U.S. Air Force F-100 jet fighters was transferred to Taiwan on November 30th, staying for five days and holding so-called "flight performances" over Taipei, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan and other cities. On the 4th, this batch of aircraft also held joint formation flight exercises with the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force over Kaohsiung.

	Commander Nelson of the U.S. Navy's Third Cruiser Fleet has been active in various parts of Taiwan for several days. Prior to this, U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Army Milton and General Advisor Millard had visited Taiwan to hold talks with the heads of the U.S. forces invading Taiwan and inspect Chiang's military bases and paratrooper training.

    美国增派军舰飞机到台湾
    进行战争挑衅活动
    新华社8日讯　台北消息：美国最近接连派军舰和飞机前往台湾，进行战争挑衅活动。
    美国海军巡洋舰队的旗舰“布莱梅顿”号在7日驶抵台湾基隆港，以“开放参观”为名进行战争恫吓。这艘美国军舰由美国本土东来，在3日驶抵台湾高雄港，5日转往澎湖马公港，然后往基隆。美国军方说，这艘重巡洋舰在台湾、澎湖“开放参观”，是为了“希望能由于这项参观而对美国海军有更多的认识”。
    美国空军一批F—100型喷气战斗机在11月30日调到台湾逗留了五天，先后在台北、台中、嘉义、台南等市的上空举行所谓“飞行表演”。这批飞机4日在高雄上空还同蒋介石空军举行混合编队飞行演习。
    美国海军第三巡洋舰队司令尼尔逊连日在台湾各地活动。在这以前，美国陆军部副部长米尔顿和总顾问米勒德曾到台湾与侵台美军首脑会谈，并且视察了蒋军基地和伞兵训练情况。
