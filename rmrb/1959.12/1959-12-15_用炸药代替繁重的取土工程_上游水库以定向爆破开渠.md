Using Explosives to Replace Laborious Earth-Moving Projects
Upstream Reservoir Opens Canal with Directional Blasting

The Upstream Reservoir in Gaoan County, Jiangxi Province, has successfully used the experience of directional blasting for earth-moving, quickly and economically solving the most difficult problem in current water conservancy construction: earth acquisition.

"Directional blasting" is the process of making the blasted earth and rock rise and reach a predetermined direction, location, and distance; it can also be blasted according to the designed depth, width, and size of the project. The Upstream Reservoir has successfully tested this method for building dams and excavating canals.

According to the engineering design, this reservoir needed to build a secondary dam 64 meters long and 7 meters high. This dam required more than 16,000 cubic meters of earth, which originally required more than 16,000 workdays. After using the directional blasting method for earth acquisition, it only took 160 workdays to drill blasting holes, load explosives, and complete the work. Four shots were fired in succession, and the earth dam was built. The amount of explosives used was less than one jin per cubic meter of earth. This reduced the processes of digging and transporting earth, saving more than 15,000 workdays and nearly 10,000 yuan in construction costs, and advanced the construction period by two months. In addition, the reservoir also used the principle of heaving and throwing blasting in directional blasting to excavate a mountain-penetrating canal that had to pass through more than 160 mountain peaks, saving a total of 400,000 man-days and 100,000 yuan in construction costs.

The advantages of directional blasting for earth acquisition include not only accelerating construction progress, reducing labor intensity, and saving labor and funds, but also eliminating the threat of rain, snow, and freezing temperatures during winter construction because it does not require fieldwork and only requires drilling holes inside caves. At the same time, when excavating channels 20 meters deep, it can also solve the problem of extracting soil and stone from excessively deep channels, avoiding complicated construction procedures such as drainage in the channel and soil extraction in the water.

    用炸药代替繁重的取土工程
    上游水库以定向爆破开渠
    江西高安县上游水库成功地运用定向爆破取土经验，又快又省地解决了当前水利施工中最困难的取土问题。
    “定向爆破”就是使爆破的土石方，按照预定的方向、地点和距离扬起和送达；也可以按照工程设计的深浅、宽狭、大小进行爆破。上游水库已经试验成功用这种办法进行筑坝和开挖渠道。
    这个水库按工程设计需要建设一座长六十四米、高七米的副坝，这座坝共需取土一万六千多立方米，原来需要用一万六千多个工作日；在使用定向爆破的取土方法以后，只用一百六十个工作日来打炮眼、装炸药和收尾，一次连放四炮，就把这座土坝筑成了。所用炸药每方土不到一斤。这样就减少了挖土、运土等工序，节省了一万五千多个工作日和近一万元的施工经费，并且使工期提前了两个月。另外，这个水库还运用定向爆破中扬弃爆破的原理，开挖了一条要穿过一百六十多个山头的穿山渠道，一共节省了四十万个人工和十万元施工经费。
    定向爆破取土的好处，除了能加快施工进度，减轻劳动强度和节省劳力、经费以外，还由于不在野外作业，只需在洞内打炮眼，因而就解除了冬季施工中阴雨和天寒地冻的威胁。同时，在开挖二十米深的渠道时，还可解决因渠道太深土石方不易提取的问题，避免了渠中排水和水中取土等复杂的施工工序。
