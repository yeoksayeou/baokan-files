Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 5th: The World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on the 4th, expressing its full support for the magnificent struggle of the Japanese people against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The statement said that revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" runs counter to the general trend of easing international tensions, and will only aggravate the "Cold War" and endanger peace in the Far East and the world.

The World Federation of Trade Unions called on workers all over the world to support the struggle of Japanese workers and the Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 4th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth recently sent a telegram to the "Central Joint Struggle Conference of Japanese Youth and Students to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," expressing solidarity with the struggle of Japanese youth to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and to abolish the treaty, and condemning the suppression of the legitimate actions of the Japanese people and youth.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 6th: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council today sent a letter to the Japanese people, expressing support for the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The letter pointed out that fourteen years have passed since the end of World War II, and the U.S. military still occupies hundreds of military bases scattered throughout Japan. The letter said that revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is one of the conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists to undermine Afro-Asian solidarity and make Afro-Asian countries hostile to each other. The imperialists are plotting to permanently maintain an abnormal situation in East Asia, aggravate world tensions, and maintain and expand their political and economic rule in Asia by revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The letter said that the people of Afro-Asian countries, who have suffered from imperialist oppression for centuries, express serious concern about the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." They are closely watching the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against this treaty and for Japan's complete independence. The demonstration held by the Japanese people on November 27 deeply moved all peace-loving people.

The letter concluded by saying that the African people who are demanding that the imperialists get out of Africa also demand that the U.S. military get out of Japan, because the victory of the Japanese people is the victory of the people of Afro-Asian countries.

The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council also sent a telegram to the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, expressing support for the Japanese people's right to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which may turn Japan into a U.S. atomic base.

The telegram said that the stationing of foreign troops in Asia and Africa is a violation of the Bandung Conference principles and the resolutions of the Cairo Conference.

The Secretariat believes that the retention of these foreign troops is a threat to Afro-Asian solidarity and world peace, and the Secretariat fully supports the Japanese people's struggle to break free from foreign control.

    世界工联、世界青联、亚非团结理事会声明
    支持日本人民反对修改“安全条约”
    新华社布拉格5日电　世界工会联合会4日发表声明，表示完全支持日本人民为反对修改日美“安全条约”所进行的波澜壮阔的斗争。
    声明说，修改日美“安全条约”是同缓和国际紧张局势的总的趋向相违背的，它只会加剧“冷战”和危及远东和世界和平。
    世界工会联合会号召全世界工人声援日本工人和日本人民的斗争。
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　世界民主青年联盟书记处最近打电报给日本“青年和学生阻止修改安全条约中央共同斗争会议”，表示声援日本青年阻止修改日美“安全条约”和争取废除这一条约的斗争，并且谴责对日本人民和青年的正当行动的镇压。
    新华社开罗6日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天在给日本人民的一封信中，表示支持日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的英勇斗争。
    信中指出，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，已经有十四年了，美国军队还占领着散布在日本各地的数百个军事基地。这封信说，修改日美“安全条约”是美帝国主义者破坏亚非团结、使亚非国家互相敌对的阴谋之一。帝国主义者阴谋通过修改日美“安全条约”在东亚永久保持不正常的局面、加剧世界紧张局势以及维持和扩大他们在亚洲的政治和经济统治。
    这封信说，几世纪以来遭受帝国主义压迫的亚非各国人民对于修改日美“安全条约”表示严重的不安。他们密切注视着日本人民反对这个条约和争取日本完全独立的英勇斗争。日本人民在11月27日举行的示威深深地感动了所有爱好和平的人民。
    这封信最后说，要求帝国主义者滚出非洲的非洲人民也要求美国军队滚出日本，因为日本人民的胜利就是亚非各国人民的胜利。
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处还向日本亚非团结委员会拍发了一份电报，表示支持日本人民在反对修改日美“安全条约”方面的权利，这个条约可能使日本变成美国的原子基地。
    电报说，外国军队驻在亚洲和非洲是违反万隆会议原则和开罗大会的决议的。
    书记处认为这些外国军队的留驻是对亚非团结和世界和平的一个威胁，书记处充分支持日本人民为摆脱外国控制而进行的斗争。
