Xinhua News Agency, 5th. After a year of rectification and transformation, the nation's small-scale coal mines are developing rapidly along a normal and healthy path. Although the number of mine shafts and the labor force employed in small-scale coal mines across the country have been greatly reduced, the coal output of small-scale mines this year has exceeded last year's production level. According to statistics from seven provinces and autonomous regions, including Hunan, Henan, Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, 698 mine shafts have already been transformed this year. The production capacity of these mine shafts has more than doubled compared to before the transformation, thus not only meeting the needs of the widespread small blast furnaces and decentralized local industrial, agricultural, and civilian coal use, but also laying the foundation for continued development and improvement in the future.

The rectification and transformation work of small coal mines across the country was carried out on the basis of the great development last year. In the second half of last year, in order to support the "iron and steel marshal's ascent to power," a massive mass movement to run mines was launched across the country, and many small coal mines were opened. This year, according to the layout of the iron and steel industry and the local industrial and agricultural coal needs, localities carried out the "five fixings" work of small coal mines: fixing locations, types, personnel, organization, and leadership. At the same time, according to the principle of "overall transformation, focusing on improvement," technical transformation was carried out on small coal kilns with better resources and transportation conditions. After rectification and transformation, many small coal kilns have gradually transformed from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, into semi-mechanized mines, with continuously improving output and production efficiency. For example, in Hunan Province, the annual production capacity and average daily output of the 88 transformed mine shafts have more than doubled compared to before the transformation, labor efficiency has increased by one to 1.3 times, and costs have been reduced by 50%. In Henan Province, the average daily output of the 99 transformed mine shafts has also increased by nearly two times compared to the original.

After rectification and transformation, many small coal mines not only reduced the heavy physical labor of workers and improved underground working conditions, but also enhanced their ability to resist natural disasters. In Wuhu, Anqing, Fuyang and other special districts of Anhui Province, many small coal mines mobilized the masses to make great efforts in tool reform, universally adopting cars with light rails on the ground, using indigenous winches and millstones at the mine entrances, and using ropes and pulleys in areas with slopes. Now, these coal mines have basically eliminated phenomena such as carrying on shoulders, backs, and by hand. In the past, southern provinces such as Hunan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan have always had the habit of "digging coal in winter and resting in spring." During the rainy season, a large number of small coal kilns were often flooded, and production was intermittent. Since this year, many mine shafts have strengthened flood control measures in the technical transformation and began to change historical practices. Some mine shafts that have undergone key transformation have maintained normal production even during the rainy season.

With the development of rectification and technical transformation, the management and technical level of small coal mines in various places have also improved significantly. Some small coal mines have initially implemented planned management. The mines have also cultivated and trained a large number of management cadres and technical personnel through production practice, as well as by running training courses, organizing on-site visits and technical demonstrations, and entrusting large mines to provide training. Some regions, in conjunction with the rectification and transformation of small coal mines, have paid special attention to the comprehensive utilization of coal, not only supporting agricultural production, but also opening up broad avenues for the development of small coal mines. For example, the Jinbei Special District in Shanxi Province has built 42 small oil refineries near small coal mines. These small oil refineries have produced a large amount of light and heavy diesel oil, asphalt, semi-coke, and various chemical raw materials. Some coal mines in Sichuan, Hunan, and other places use the waste gas left over from coking or oil refining to make highly effective ammonium sulfate or local fertilizers for use in nearby rural areas.

At present, although the rectification and transformation of small coal mines across the country has achieved great results, it is still not compatible with the ever-increasing national needs. The transformation work of small coal mines in some areas has not yet been fully completed. These small coal mines still have some difficulties in equipment, transportation, and other aspects, which restrict the continued increase in output. Therefore, at the recently held National Small Coal Mine Work Conference, the guiding principles and tasks for further transforming small coal mines were discussed, and 60 advanced experiences in transforming small coal mines in 15 aspects, including drainage, ventilation, lighting, hoisting, coal mining, and tunneling, were shared. The conference also passed a proposal to rapidly launch a red flag competition movement in small coal mines across the country. In addition to evaluating various technical and economic indicators, this movement will also evaluate the achievements of technical transformation in small coal mines.

### 由小到大由土到洋逐步进行技术改造  全国许多小煤矿走上半机械化  湖南河南等七个省区六百九十八对矿井生产能力提高一倍以上

    由小到大由土到洋逐步进行技术改造
    全国许多小煤矿走上半机械化
    湖南河南等七个省区六百九十八对矿井生产能力提高一倍以上
    新华社5日讯　全国小型煤矿经过一年来的整顿和改造以后，正在沿着正常、健康的道路迅速发展。目前，全国小型煤矿的矿井数量和占用的劳动力虽然大为减少，但是今年小型矿井的煤炭产量却超过了去年的生产水平。据湖南、河南、安徽、山东、山西、广东、广西七个省、自治区的统计，今年就已经改造了六百九十八对矿井。这些矿井的生产能力比改造以前提高了一倍以上，因而，不仅满足了遍地开花的小高炉和分散性的地方工业、农业、民用煤的需要，而且为今后的继续发展和提高奠定了基础。
    全国小型煤矿的整顿、改造工作是在去年大发展的基础上进行的。去年下半年，各地为了支援钢铁元帅升帐，开展了声势浩大的群众办矿运动，开办了许多小型煤矿。今年各地又根据钢铁工业的布局以及当地工农业的用煤需要，对小型煤矿进行了定点、定型、定员、定组织、定领导的“五定”工作，同时根据“全面改造、重点提高”的方针，对资源、交通等条件较好的小煤窑进行了技术改造。许多小煤窑在经过整顿改造以后，已经由小到大、由土到洋地逐步变成了半机械化的矿井，产量和生产效率不断提高。例如湖南省改造的八十八对矿井，年产能力和平均日产量都已比改造前提高了一倍，劳动效率提高了一倍到一点三倍，成本降低50％。河南省改造的九十九对矿井，平均日产量也已经比原来提高了将近两倍。
    许多小型煤矿在经过整顿和改造以后，不但减轻了工人的笨重体力劳动，改善了井下的作业条件，同时还增强了抵抗自然灾害的能力。安徽省芜湖、安庆、阜阳等专区的许多小煤矿发动群众大闹工具改革，在平地上普遍采用了有轻便轨道的车子，在井口采用土制绞车和磨盘，在有坡道的地方用绳索和滑车。现在，这些煤矿已经基本上消灭了肩挑、人背、人抬等现象。湖南、江西、四川等南方各省，过去历来都有“冬季挖煤春季歇”的习惯，一到雨季，经常有大批的小煤窑被水淹没，生产时断时续；今年以来，许多矿井由于在技术改造中加强了防水措施，开始改变了历史惯例。有一些经过重点改造的矿井，即使在雨季也保持了正常生产。
    随着整顿和技术改造工作的开展，各地小型煤矿的管理和技术水平也有显著提高。有的小煤矿已经初步实行了计划管理。各矿还通过生产实践，以及办训练班、组织现场参观和技术表演、委托大矿代为训练等办法，培养训练了大批管理干部和技术人材。有些地区结合整顿和改造小煤矿，特别注意了煤炭的综合利用，不但支援了农业生产，还为小煤矿的发展开辟了广阔的道路。如山西省晋北专区已在小煤矿附近办起四十二个小型炼油厂。这些小炼油厂已经生产出大量轻重柴油、沥青、半焦和各种化工原料。四川、湖南等地有的煤矿利用炼焦或炼油后剩下的废气，制成肥效很高的硫铵或土化肥，供应附近农村使用。
    目前，全国小型煤矿的整顿和改造工作虽然获得很大成绩，但是与日益增长的国家需要比较起来，还是不相适应的。部分地区的小煤矿改造工作，还没有全部完成。这些小煤矿在设备、运输等方面还存在着一些困难，使产量继续提高受到限制。因此，在最近召开的全国小型煤矿工作会议上，讨论了进一步改造小煤矿的方针任务，着重交流了包括排水、通风、照明、提升、采煤、掘进等十五个方面的六十项改造小煤矿的先进经验。会上还通过倡议，要在全国小型煤矿中迅速开展红旗竞赛运动。这个运动的内容除了评比各项技术经济指标以外，还将评比小型煤矿技术改造的成绩。
