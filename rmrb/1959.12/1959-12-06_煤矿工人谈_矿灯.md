Coal Miners Talk About "Mine Lamp"

    "Mine Lamp" is a new film presented by Beijing Film Studio to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It vividly reflects the tragic life of coal miners before liberation under the cruel oppression and exploitation of the three major enemies: British and Japanese imperialists, Kuomintang reactionaries, and feudal foremen. It also depicts the arduous process of the workers, under the wise leadership of the Party, fighting the reactionaries with steely resolve and unity, and finally achieving victory. The film, using Lu Zi, Shun Zi, and others as representatives, shows how the younger generation of miners, under the Party's close guidance, withstood the tests of life and struggle and finally grew into strong class warriors. It embodies the inseparable relationship between the Party and the masses and the noble qualities of the working class: indomitable spirit, solidarity, and mutual assistance. Cadres and workers of the Jingxi Mining Area watched the film and organized a discussion. Below is a partial record of the discussion. – Editor

    Interwoven with Class Struggle and National Struggle

    Li Changshun (Secretary of the Jingxi Mining Bureau Party Committee):

    We are very happy that the film "Mine Lamp" has been made. This has been the wish of the majority of miners and many coal mine workers for the past few years since liberation. The film is successful; it vividly portrays class struggle, sharply exposes the ugliness of the old society and imperialism, and embodies the Party's leadership over the workers.

    I once suggested to the screenwriter, Comrade Lin Yi: the sharper the exposure of the oppression of the old society and imperialism, the better. This is a profound class education. Many people living in cities do not know this kind of life. In the old society, the life of the Mentougou coal miners was so miserable. At that time, people went down the well as coal miners only when they had nowhere else to go, and they were generally bankrupt peasants. The scene in the film of a person being eaten by dogs sharply illustrates the essence of that society. Therefore, if the film used a few shots to show the new life of coal miners now, a comparison between the old and the new would still be necessary.

    Li Wen (Chengzi Coal Mine):

    The film reflects the Party's leadership over the workers and has a strong fighting spirit. It embodies both the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the workers, and the tragic life and arduous struggles of the coal miners in the old society. It basically achieves the original purpose of making this film, which is to educate young workers through the comparison of the facts of the new and old societies, and to enable the old workers to cherish the current new life and new society even more as they look back on the past and think about the present.

    The first half of the film, which depicts the workers' miserable life and the solidarity of the working class, with the poor helping the poor, is truly touching. It particularly highlights the solidarity between those working outside the mine and those inside.

    The structure of the film is also relatively compact, and the music is well-matched, especially the theme song, which expresses the workers' desire for liberation at that time. Some of the handling is also good: for example, the first time there was an accident in the mine, the shot of the dead miners being carried out, and the British boss sitting in a soft sedan carried by four people, although only a fleeting image, is a sharp contrast and very telling.

    I have a few comments on some of the details: the scene in which the Communist Party member Fu Dongshan meets with Bainiao is not strong and powerful enough, lacking in grandeur. Also, in the scene where Wang Laotou is fished out of the pot gang by two white-faced men and thrown to the riverbank to be fed to the dogs, it is not clear whether those two guys are white-faced men or workers, because there is no explanation beforehand. A voice-over would make it clearer.

    Song Enrong (Director of Jingxi Mining Bureau):

    The film "Mine Lamp" gives a very good impression. It is permeated with class struggle and national struggle from beginning to end. It powerfully portrays the Party's leadership, and the Party's policies are also clear. The growth of miners from childhood to adulthood is also well-portrayed. The film gives a tragic impression from the start. The exposure of the situation at that time had to be like this, so that people would hate the old society when they watched it.

    I read the draft of this film script once. It is quite reasonable that Erdouzi was tricked by the supervisor into saying, "Lu Zi usually listens to Brother Fu the most." Erdouzi is a timid person who lives his life haphazardly and is not clear about class struggle. He said it unintentionally, which suits his character. In addition, the film uses a heavy can (a car used to push coal in the kiln) falling off the track to prevent the supervisor from closing the water gate and save the miners, making the vicious supervisor panic. Not only did his wishful thinking fail, but he also received a heavy kick from the Japanese guard captain, which was very satisfying. This scene is very good both ideologically and artistically. It exposes the insidiousness of the enemy and the traitors, and highlights the contradictions and conflicts within the enemy, as well as the working brothers' struggle against the enemy and their noble spirit of sacrificing themselves to save their brothers.

    Watch the Movie, Receive Education – Think About the Past, Compare with the Present

    Ma Tianshan (Representative of an Advanced Collective Attending the Congress of Heroes):

    The movie is like acting out my own past. The lives of the miners in the past were like this. However, the film did not show scenes of miners being beaten and scolded by mine police when they got into the cage. At that time, when workers went down the well, the mine police would drive them into the cage with whips, like herding livestock. Whoever resisted would be beaten. Almost no worker had never been beaten. The living quarters were dilapidated. An old man named Gao was sleeping when a stone fell from the roof and killed him. There were so many lice and fleas that they jumped up. People often said that mules and horses eat red sorghum when they go down the pit, but we coal miners only eat bean cakes. It was common for children like Lu Zi and Shun Zi to go down the well at the age of ten.

    What about now? My family lives warmly and comfortably. The working conditions are so good. We dress even better than when we got married. When I got married, everything I wore from head to toe was borrowed from others.

    This time, I am again representing our team at the Congress of Heroes. This is the greatest glory and trust the Party and the people have given me. Thinking about the past and comparing it with the present, what difficulties cannot be overcome? What is there not to put in full effort and strive to exceed the coal production target this year?

    Li Jiude (Drilling Worker, Representative Attending the Congress of Heroes):

    After watching the movie today, it made me think about the past, which is a profound education for me. Everything we have today is due to the Party's leadership, the bloodshed and sacrifice of the worker brothers, and their arduous struggle. Recalling the past, we cherish today's life, which is hard-won. When I saw Lu Zi, Shi Tou, and others going down the well to work, the clothes they wore, the food they ate, and their ages were similar to when I went down the well. When I saw the several poor children of the Da Ju family, their eyes fixed on the cake in the basket, afraid to take it down to eat, and Lu Zi dividing it for them but they still dared not eat it, I couldn't help but cry as I watched. Especially when I saw the section where old man Wang Fuhou was thrown to the riverbank and dogs were called to eat him, I couldn't bear to look down. It's not that I'm weak. The tragic life of our miner brothers in the past really breaks my heart, and I can't help but hate the old society. I started carrying coal in small kilns in Mentougou when I was thirteen years old. Even when I was sick, I had to risk my life to work. So when I saw the foreman whipping the worker brothers in the movie, it was as if the pain was on my own body.

    In those dark days, it was really like stars hoping for the moon, and it was not easy to finally wait for liberation. In June 1949, I came to the Chengzi Coal Mine, which had not been open for long. The cadres gave me a wage card and said to me very kindly, "In order to ensure the lives of the workers, we will temporarily issue wages in kind, eight catties of millet per day, and we will gradually increase it in the future." I was stunned when I picked up the wage card and couldn't believe my ears. I remember the first time I carried a bag of millet home, my mother took out a handful of golden millet, and her tears fell with joy.

    From then on, our family's life, like that of worker brothers all over the country, underwent earth-shaking changes. Our family lived comfortably and happily. To say nothing else, before liberation, the whole family of six had two quilts. Now, with eleven people, everyone has a set of quilts and mattresses, and there is still a surplus. In the past, I rarely went out of Mentougou. Now, I have been to the world's first socialist country, the Soviet Union.

    In the past, capitalists and foremen simply did not regard workers as human beings. People were not as good as machines. Even when there was water, they would call workers to work. After liberation, the mine leaders repeatedly emphasized safety equipment, and work must be done in accordance with regulations. In the past, capitalists did not provide pillars underground. Now, the leaders criticize anyone who does not put up pillars. If there is any accident in the working face, they first ask if anyone is safe, and then ask about the situation of the machines. The Party has always been so concerned about us and taught us. Without the Party, where would we be today?

    In the past ten years, I feel that I have only done the work that I should have done for the people, but the Party has encouraged me and taught me so much, and has given me great honor. Recently, I also attended the National Congress of Heroes. Comparing the past, thinking about today's socialist motherland and the future of communism, I can only work harder and harder.

    The Party is like the mine lamp of coal miners. In the darkness, it gave us warmth and light, and guided us onto the road to happiness. We can never be separated from the Party. No matter how the imperialists and right-leaning opportunists slander and spread rumors, these iron facts will smash them to pieces.

    Zhang Jiesheng (Chengzi Coal Mine):

    This film is of great educational significance to both new and old workers. Now that the film has removed the prelude and epilogue from the original script, some worker comrades have opinions. After watching the movie today, they called me from underground, believing that a little bit of the happy new life after liberation should be shown, so that the educational significance would be greater. This feeling is completely understandable, indicating the love of the working class, who have turned over and become masters, for the new life and their gratitude to the Party. I hope to continue filming a film that reflects the improvement of the political status and living standards of coal miners in the new society, and the new achievements in production during the Great Leap Forward.

    In addition, I have two small suggestions: first, body searches were very fierce during the Japanese imperialist occupation, but the film did not show much of this. Secondly, the scene in the film of giving the dying Da Ju's father a bowl of hot soup is not in line with the situation at that time. There was no hot soup to drink underground at that time. The workers drank dirty water from the ditch.

    Deng Fuyin (Old Worker):

    The movie portrays it exactly right. When I saw families breaking up and people starving, my tears fell. I came to the Mentougou mine at the age of eleven, walking the small kilns and carrying coal in the small kilns. I have walked all the kilns in Mentougou. But my family's life was not settled at all. After working for a year, I still couldn't pay off the pot gang's debt. Once, I didn't dare to leave the kiln entrance for three months, for fear that the pot gang would catch me.

    As soon as liberation came, I worked in the mine and became a squad leader. At that time, there were no pneumatic hammers, electric chutes, or electric poles. A group of more than twenty people only produced half a ton of coal. Now, there are many advanced tools, and there is also hydraulic coal mining. The highest output of a shift can be 300 tons of coal. Safety is also well-managed. There have been no industrial injuries for ten years.

    For four generations, my family has been illiterate. Now, not only do we eat well and dress well, but all four of my children are in school, one in high school, one in junior high school, and two in elementary school. I have also joined the Party myself. All this was given to me by the Party and the people. If it weren't for the Party, I wouldn't even exist. I now have hemiplegia and cannot work, but according to the labor insurance regulations, I still receive my salary every month. How can I, who drink the water, forget the person who dug the well? So as soon as my health improved, I asked the section chief to let me go down the well. If I couldn't go down the well, I would do some work to deliver tools. Besides, I am a Party member and must do my best to work for the Party.

    This kind of movie should be shown to new workers more often so that they can be educated.

    Wang Fengzhi (Family Member of an Old Worker):

    The movie gave me a profound education today. Now that we are liberated, our workers' families will no longer stand at the door and wait for their husbands and sons to come back when they get off work, like before liberation. When we meet, we first ask if what they pulled today is enough to eat? Were they beaten?

    Now we have everything to eat, wear, and use, and the children are all in school. Women also participate in production. In the past, we were hungry all day long, so how could we have any work? We can never forget the kindness of the Communist Party to us. Comparing our past lives, even though I cannot directly participate in production, I must do a good job in the auxiliary departments.

### 煤矿工人谈“矿灯”

    煤矿工人谈“矿灯”
    “矿灯”是北京电影制片厂向建国十周年献礼的新片。它生动地反映了解放前煤矿工人在英、日帝国主义、国民党反动派和封建把头这三大敌人的残酷压迫和剥削下的悲惨生活，以及工人们在党的英明领导下，坚强如钢、团结一致地向反动派进行斗争，终于获得胜利的艰苦过程。影片以路子、顺子等为代表，表现了青年一代矿工在党的亲切教导下，经受住了生活和斗争的考验，终于成为坚强的阶级战士的成长过程；体现了党和群众的水乳交融关系和工人阶级不屈不挠、团结互助的高贵品质。京西矿区的干部和工人们看了这部片子后，组织了座谈。下面发表的是座谈的一部分纪录。　　——编　者
    贯穿着阶级斗争和民族斗争
    李长顺（京西矿务局党委书记）：
    “矿灯”这部电影拍摄出来了，使我们很高兴。这是解放后几年来广大矿工和不少煤矿工作者的愿望。影片是成功的，表现阶级斗争很鲜明，对旧社会和帝国主义的丑恶揭露得很尖锐，党对工人的领导也体现出来了。
    我曾经向编剧林艺同志建议：揭露旧社会和帝国主义的压迫越尖锐越好，这是深刻的阶级教育，许多住在城市里的人是不知道这种生活的。在旧社会门头沟煤矿工人的生活就是这样的凄苦，那时候人到了无路可走的时候才下井去当煤矿工人，一般都是破产农民。像影片里反映的人被狗吃，就很尖锐地说明了这种社会本质。因此，如果在影片里，用几个镜头表现一下现在煤矿工人的新生活，新旧对比，也还是有必要的。
    李　文（城子煤矿）：
    影片反映了党对工人的领导，斗争性很强。既体现了党和工人的血肉关系，也表现了煤矿工人在旧社会的悲惨生活和他们的艰苦斗争，基本上达到了原来拍这部电影的目的，通过新旧社会的事实对比，来教育青年工人，也能使老工人抚今思昔更加热爱现在的新生活、新社会。
    影片前半段描写出的工人的凄惨生活，和工人阶级的心连心、穷帮穷的团结力量，确实很感动人，这里特别突出了里外工的团结。
    片子的结构也比较紧凑，音乐配得也不错，特别是主题歌，很能道出当时工人渴望解放的心情来。有的地方处理也是不坏的：比如第一次矿上出事，抬出砸死的矿工，和英国老板坐在四人抬的软轿上，镜头虽然是一晃而过，但是个尖锐的对比，很说明问题。
    对几个小节，有点意见：共产党员傅东山见白鸟那场戏，表现得还不够坚强有力，气魄不足。另外王老头被两个白面客从锅伙里捞到河滩上喂狗一场，因为前面没有交代，看不清那两个家伙是白面客、还是工人。如果旁白点一句，就会更清楚些。
    宋恩荣（京西矿务局局长）：
    “矿灯”这部片子给人很好的印象。从始至终贯穿着阶级斗争民族斗争，表现党的领导很有力，党的政策也明确；矿工们从小到大一辈辈地成长也表现得很好。影片从开始就给人一个悲惨的印象，暴露当时情况就得这样，让人看了对旧社会仇恨。
    这个电影剧本的草稿我读过一遍。二豆子被监工骗去说出了“路子平素最听傅大哥的话”，还很合乎情理。二豆子是性情怯懦，马马虎虎过日子的人，对阶级斗争是不清楚的，无意中说出来了，很合乎他的身份。另外影片用重罐（窑内推煤用的车）落道来阻止监工关水闸门，救出矿工们，使狠毒的监工仓皇失措，不但如意算盘未成，还挨了日本警卫队长狠狠的一脚，大快人心。这一场戏，无论在思想上、艺术创造上都很好，既暴露了敌人和汉奸的阴狠，又突出了敌人内部的矛盾和冲突，和工人弟兄的对敌斗争、舍生救自己弟兄的崇高精神。
    看影片，受教育  想从前，比现在
    马天山（出席群英会先进集体代表）：
    电影就像演的自己的过去一样，过去矿工的生活就像这样，不过影片里还没有上罐笼时被矿警打骂的镜头，那时工人下井，矿警拿着根鞭子往罐笼里轰，像赶牲口一样，谁反抗，谁挨揍。几乎没有工人没挨过揍的。住处是房倒屋塌，一个姓高的老头，正睡觉房上掉下块石头，把他砸死了。虱子、跳蚤多得跳起来了。人常说骡马下坑还吃红高粱，可我们煤黑子才吃豆饼。像路子、顺子那样十多岁小孩下井是很多的。
    现在呢？我一家过得暖暖和和。工作条件又那样好。现在我们穿得比结婚时还漂亮，我结婚时从头到脚都是向人借的。
    这次我又代表我们班出席群英会，这是党和人民给我的最大光荣和信任。想想过去，比比现在，还有什么不能克服的困难，还有什么不鼓足干劲，力争今年超额完成产煤任务的呢？
    李九德（钻掘工，出席群英会代表）：
    今天看了电影，让我把过去的事联想起来，对自己是个深刻的教育。我们今天的一切，都是由于党的领导，工人兄弟流血牺牲艰苦奋斗得到的，回忆起过去，也就更宝贵得来不易的今天的生活。当我看到路子、石头几个下井去干活，穿的吃的年龄都和我下井时的情况差不多；看到大菊一家几个饿得可怜的小孩，眼睛直盯着吊篮里的饼，不敢取下来吃，路子给分了还不敢吃时，我忍不住边看边哭；尤其是看到王福厚老爹被扔到河滩上叫狗来吃他的一段，更是低头不敢看。不是我脆弱，我们矿工兄弟们过去的悲惨生活，实在叫我痛心，无法不仇恨旧社会。我从十三岁就到门头沟小窑去背煤，有了病也得豁出命去干。所以我一看到电影里把头用皮鞭抽打工人兄弟们，就像痛在我自己身上一样。
    在那黑洞洞的日子里，真是像星星盼月亮一样，好容易才盼到了解放。1949年6月，我就来到了开工不久的城子煤矿。干部发给我工资证，还很和气地对我说：“为了保证工人生活，暂时先发实物工资，每天八斤小米，以后还要逐步增加。”我拿起工资证都发了呆，简直不相信自己耳朵。记得第一次我背着一袋小米回家，我妈掏出一把黄橙橙的小米，喜欢得眼泪直往下掉。
    打这以后，我们家的生活就和全国工人兄弟一样，有了天翻地复的变化。一家过得又舒适又快活。不说别的，解放前全家六口人两床被子，现在十一口人，每人一套被和褥子还有富裕。过去我连门头沟都出去得很少，现在我已经到过世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联。
    过去，资本家、把头根本不把工人当人看，人还不如机器，有水还叫工人去干；解放后，矿上领导却一再强调安全设备，工作必须按规程办事。过去资本家不给井下打柱子；现在领导上见谁不打柱子就批评，掌子里有一点事故，首先问人平安不。我记得有一次掌子塌了顶了，领导先问有没有人受伤，然后才问到机器的情况。党一直是这样关心我们、教导我们。如果没有党，哪里又会有今日呢？
    十年来，我觉得自己只给人民作了我应作的工作，党却是那样地鼓励我、教导我，给了我极大的荣誉。最近又参加全国群英会。对照过去，想着社会主义祖国的今天和共产主义的未来，我只有努力再努力。
    党就像煤矿工人的矿灯，她在黑暗中给了我们温暖和光明，指引我们走上了幸福大道，我们和党永远也离不开。哪怕帝国主义和右倾机会主义分子的诬蔑和造谣，这些铁的事实就要把他们击得粉碎。
    张杰生（城子煤矿）：
    这部片子对新老工人来说都有很大的教育意义。现在片子去掉了原剧本中的前奏和尾声，有些工人同志有意见。今天看完了电影，他们还从井下打电话给我，认为应该表现一点解放后幸福的新生活，这样教育意义会更大。这种心情完全可以理解，说明了翻身作了主人的工人阶级对新生活的热爱，对党的感激。希望继续拍摄一部反映在新社会里的煤矿工人的政治地位、生活水平的提高，和大跃进中生产上的新成就的影片。
    另外有两点小意见：一是搜身制在日本帝国主义侵占时期是很凶的，影片没作什么表现。其次片中叫给将死的大菊的爹一碗热汤，是不符合当时情况的，那时井下是没有热汤可喝的，工人喝的都是沟里的脏水。
    邓福银（老工人）：
    电影表现得一点也没错，看到一家家散的散，饿的饿，我眼泪就掉下来了。我从十一岁上来门矿，走小窑、背小窑，门头沟的窑我都走到了。家里生活却一点没着落。干一年活，还还不清锅伙的账，有一次，我就有三个月不敢出窑口，怕锅伙逮着我。
    刚解放，我就在矿上工作，当了班长。那时风锤、电溜子、电杆子都没有，一组二十多人才出半吨煤，现在很多先进工具都有了，还有了水力采煤。一班最高能产煤三百吨。安全也搞得好，十年没出过什么工伤事故。
    我家过去四辈子都是睁眼瞎、不识字，现在我家不但吃得饱、穿得好，四个小孩都上了学，一个上高中一，一个上初中三，两个在小学。我自己也入了党。这一切都是党和人民给我的，要是没有党，真连我这个人也不会有了。我现在得了个半身不遂的病，不能干活，可是按劳保条例，每月还照样拿工资。我吃水的哪能忘了打井的人，所以我身子骨一好些，就要求段长让我下井，不能下井，便做点送工具的活。何况我又是党员，更得尽力为党工作。
    像这样的电影，应该给新工人多演几场。让他们受到教育。
    王凤芝（老工人家属）：
    今天电影给了我深刻的教育。现在解放了，我们工人家属再也不会像解放前那样，一到下工的时候，就站在门口望丈夫、儿子回来。见面就先问今天拉的够吃不？挨打了没有？
    现在吃的穿的用的哪样没有，孩子们也都上了学，妇女也参加了生产，过去成天挨饿，哪还有什么工作。说什么也忘不了共产党给我们的恩情。对比我们过去的生活，我不能直接参加生产，也要搞好辅助部门的工作。
