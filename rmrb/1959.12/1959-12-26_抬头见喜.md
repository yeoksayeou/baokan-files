　　Looking Up, Seeing Joy
  　Hua Runlu
    In another five or six days, it will be the New Year. There are many joyous events at the end of the year and the beginning, and everywhere is filled with joy. There is a Spring Festival couplet in my hometown that says: "Looking up, seeing joy." Joyous events fill the house, visible when you look up, not at all wrong. These days, opening the newspaper, what I see are reports of victory; turning on the radio, what I hear are sounds of triumph. People are laughing and discussing, truly refreshed by happy events, everyone in a cheerful mood, with even greater drive.
    Where does the joy come from? Look up and see: batches of enterprises have completed the state plan ahead of schedule and exceeded targets, tens of thousands of workers have already stepped into 1960 at high speed, the tide of technological innovation is surging, and the mass movement of "learn from, catch up with, and surpass" is rolling forward. From rural areas across the country come news of bumper harvests: the people's communes are powerful, and hundreds of millions of heroic farmers have overcome rare natural disasters in history, ensuring increased grain production and a bumper cotton harvest. On the vast land, silver hoes fall, the earth shakes, and high-efficiency movements in water conservancy construction are blossoming everywhere. Anhui reports victory: as of December 17th, the earth and stone work completed in the province has exceeded the 1 billion cubic meter mark, with an average daily efficiency of over nine cubic meters per person. Hubei reports good news: there are already more than 2 million new water control tools, increasing efficiency by one to two times, and in some cases, by dozens or hundreds of times. The pig farming industry is developing at high speed, with red banner counties for pig farming constantly emerging: Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County in Hubei, Xinle County in Hebei, and Yushan County in Jiangxi have all achieved one pig per mu. ... Listen! Drums and gongs sound together, everywhere a sound of victory. Truly, the leap forward situation is infinitely good, and there is no telling how many joyous events there are.
    We are marching from victory to victory. Last year, we predicted this year's victory, and now we have indeed been victorious. This year, we also expect next year's victory, and next year's victory will certainly come. "You are being idealistic!" No! We are being realistic and pragmatic. We saw victory in the Party's General Line, we saw victory in the people's soaring enthusiasm, we saw victory in the momentum of the Great Leap Forward. We see victory in the rising sun—the people's communes. Look, haven't those who have completed the 1959 journey already prepared themselves and stepped onto a new journey with confidence? Aren't those with strong will striving to achieve even greater victories without arrogance or impatience? Next year's victory is already nurtured in the people's strong will, nurtured in the seething enthusiasm. We are never satisfied, not only looking up at today, but also looking up at tomorrow. We always walk with our heads held high, with broad vision, looking ahead, full of the conviction of victory and the spirit of revolutionary optimism.
    In this world, our many joyous events cause others much sadness, our great joy causes some great sorrow, our Great Leap Forward causes some great curses. Not long ago, didn't those Western bourgeois gentlemen still scold us for "swallowing a bitter pill" and for "economic collapse"? What are the facts? It is not us, but they themselves who have "swallowed a bitter pill" and are experiencing "economic collapse". They once gloated over their slander of our Great Leap Forward and people's communes, cursing us for being in "the darkest year", saying that we faced a "serious crisis" and were "already in an incurable situation". Even the editors of the London Times smugly said that they "don't have to worry about the threat of that giant dragon for the time being" and can "catch their breath a little". But what are the facts? This year, our Party's General Line has shone brightly, the people's communes have shone brightly, the national leap forward situation has shone brightly, and our country is full of light and splendor. This year is a glorious year for us. But the Western gentlemen's days are truly dark and lackluster, barely surviving. Faced with our continued Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest, they tremble at the sound of gongs and drums, and are saddened by joyous events, our boundless joy makes them cry tears of sorrow, gnash their teeth, and hate that we don't fail, don't retreat, don't die; but we are even more prosperous, advanced, vigorous, and have boundless longevity. What can be done about it? It "conforms to the principles of heaven, responds to human feelings, and is suitable for the trend of the world," who dares to do anything about it, who can do anything about it? We hahahaha, they wuwuwu, this is our counter-drama with imperialism.
      "The enemy is rotting away day by day, we are getting better day by day," the fate of all imperialism has long been decided. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out twenty years ago that the capitalist ideological system and social system have "'the sun is setting beyond the western hills, its breath is weak, human life is precarious, and it does not worry about the evening', and is about to enter the museum. Only the communist ideological system and social system are surging throughout the world with the momentum of overturning mountains and seas, the power of thunder, and maintaining their wonderful youth." (On New Democracy) Isn't that the case? Our country and six hundred million heroic people, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, are "surging throughout the world with the momentum of overturning mountains and seas, and the power of thunder." Any slander or curse from the enemy will not darken the sun, nor will it save their own tragic fate. Because: "The socialist system is bound to replace the capitalist system; this is an objective law independent of man's will. However much the reactionaries try to hold back the wheel of history, revolution will take place sooner or later and will inevitably triumph. 'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese saying to describe the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries in all countries are precisely such fools." (Mao Zedong's speech at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union celebrating 40th anniversary of the October Revolution).
    Today, we have many joyous events, and tomorrow, we will still have many joyous events. Let those fools do their best to slander and curse. We will always hold our heads high, looking up at that great goal, looking up at that broad road to progress, and march forward triumphantly!

　　抬头见喜
  　华润露
    再过五六天就是新年了。岁尾年首喜事多，到处喜气洋洋。我们家乡有一句春联是：“抬头见喜”。喜事盈门，抬头可见，一点也不错。这些天来，打开报纸，看到的是捷报；扭开收音机，听到的是捷音。人们笑着、议论着，真是人逢喜事精神爽，人人心情舒畅，干劲更高。
    喜从何来？抬头请看：一批又一批的企业提前超额完成了国家计划，成千上万的工人早已高速度跨进1960年，技术革新的浪潮汹涌澎湃，“学、赶、超、帮”的群众运动滚滚向前。各地农村传来丰收喜讯：人民公社威力强大，亿万英雄农民战胜了历史上少有的自然灾害，确保了粮食增产，棉花大丰收。在广阔的大地上，银锄落处地动山摇，水利建设中的高工效运动处处开花。安徽告捷：到12月17日止，全省所做土石方工程已突破十亿立方大关，平均每人每日工效达到九方以上。湖北报喜：治水新工具已有二百多万件，提高工效一倍到两倍，有的提高几十倍到百多倍。养猪事业高速度发展，养猪红旗县不断出现：湖北新晃侗族自治县、河北新乐县、江西玉山县都已达到了一亩一头猪。……听！锣鼓齐鸣，到处一片报捷声。真正是，跃进形势无限好，喜事不知有多少。
    我们是从胜利走向胜利的。去年，我们就预言过今年的胜利，如今我们果然是胜利了。今年，我们还预期着明年的胜利，明年的胜利也一定会到来。“你们这是唯心主义！”不！我们正是实事求是。我们从党的总路线上看到了胜利，我们从群众的冲天干劲上看到了胜利，我们从大跃进的声势中看到了胜利。我们从初升的太阳——人民公社中看到了胜利，请看，那些走完了1959年路程的人们不是已经作好准备，信心百倍地走上新的路程吗？那些意志顽强的人们不是正在不骄不躁、千方百计地夺取更大的胜利吗？明年的胜利，早已孕育在人们坚强的意志里，孕育在热气腾腾的冲天干劲里了。我们从来都是不满足的，不仅抬头看今天，而且抬头看明天。我们永远抬着头走路，目光远大，看着前方，充满着必胜的信念和革命的乐观主义精神。
    在这个世界上，我们喜事多，就引起别人伤心多，我们大欢乐，有人就大悲哀，我们大跃进，有人便大咒骂。不久以前，那些西方资产阶级的老爷们，不是还在骂我们“吞了苦丸”“经济崩溃”吗？事实如何呢？“吞了苦丸”“经济崩溃”的不是别人，正是他们自己。他们曾经得意忘形地诬蔑我们的大跃进、人民公社，咒骂我们正处在“最暗淡的一年”，照他们说来，我们面临着“严重的危机”，简直“已经陷入不可救药的地步”了。甚至就连伦敦泰晤士报的编辑先生们，也洋洋自得地说什么“暂时不必担心那条巨龙的威胁”了，可以“稍稍喘一口气”了。但是，事实又是如何呢？这一年来，我们党的总路线大放光明，人民公社大放光明，全国的跃进形势大放光明，我们的国家到处一片光明灿烂，今年是我们的一个光明年。而西方老爷们的日子，却真是暗淡无光，苟延残喘。在我们继续大跃进、大丰收的事实面前，听锣鼓而胆战，睹喜事而神伤，我们的无限欢乐，使他们伤心落泪，咬牙切齿，恨我们不败，不退，不死；我们却更加繁荣、前进、生气勃勃，万寿无疆。这有什么办法呢？“顺乎天理，应乎人情，适乎世界之潮流”嘛，谁又敢把它怎么样，能把它怎么样？我们哈哈哈，他们呜呜呜，这就是我们和帝国主义的对台戏。
      “敌人在一天天烂下去，我们在一天天好起来”，一切帝国主义的命运早已经盖棺论定了。我们伟大的领袖毛主席在二十年前就指出过，资本主义的思想体系和社会制度，已经“‘日薄西山，气息奄奄，人命危浅，朝不虑夕’，快进博物馆了。惟独共产主义的思想体系和社会制度，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。”（新民主主义论）事情不正是如此吗？我们的国家和六亿英雄的人民，正是在共产党的英明领导下，以“排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界”的，敌人的任何诬蔑、咒骂，都不会使得太阳暗淡下来，也不会挽救他们自己的悲惨命运。因为：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”（毛主席在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年会议上的讲话）。
    今天，我们喜事盈门，明天，我们还是喜事盈门。随便那些蠢人们怎样施展诬蔑、咒骂的伎俩好了。我们永远昂首挺胸，抬头看着那个伟大的目标，抬头看着那条前进的康庄大道，高歌猛进！
