    Hungary's Socialist Construction Has Bright Prospects
    The Chinese People Are Happy For Hungary's Achievements
    Comrade Tan Zhenlin's Speech At The Hungarian Party Congress
Dear Comrades:
    Entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, our delegation of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the entire Chinese people and all members of the Communist Party of China, extends warm congratulations to the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and, through the Congress, expresses heartfelt respect to the fraternal Hungarian people and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.
    Under the leadership of the Hungarian working class, with the Hungarian Communists as the core, the Hungarian people have carried out a long-term and unyielding struggle for the cause of revolution and socialism in Hungary. After experiencing a difficult, tortuous, and glorious fighting path, the people's regime was established in Hungary, democratic reforms were completed, and socialist revolution and socialist construction were carried out, making Hungary a member of the great socialist camp.
    In 1956, the Hungarian working class and working people once again underwent a severe test. At that time, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, headed by Comrade Kadar, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and the support of all progressive forces in the world, smashed the counter-revolutionary rebellion launched by foreign imperialism and domestic counter-revolutionary forces, and defended the socialist cause of the Hungarian people. This serious test not only taught the Hungarian people a lesson, but also taught the people of all socialist countries and the proletariat of the world a lesson.
    Over the past three years, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, based on the experience of class struggle and economic construction in the past, has carried out arduous struggles on the ideological and political fronts. In this struggle, the party ranks have become stronger, the positions of the working class have been consolidated, and the broad masses of people have become more closely united around the party. Over the past three years, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian people have not only rapidly restored the national economy, but also continued to develop socialist construction at a higher speed. The people's living standards have been continuously improving. The socialist transformation of agriculture has also made great progress. Now, the Hungarian people are victoriously implementing the three-year plan for the development of the national economy. The overfulfillment of this plan will create a higher starting point for the new five-year plan and accelerate Hungary's socialist construction.
    At the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Central Committee's proposals on economic tasks and the targets for the formulation of the second five-year plan will be discussed. The targets of the new five-year plan indicate that by 1965, industry will increase by 65% to 70% compared to 1958, agriculture will increase by 30% to 32% compared to the average level of 1954-1958, the socialist transformation of agriculture will be successfully completed, and the people's living standards will be further improved, thus presenting a bright picture of a new upsurge in economy and culture before the Hungarian people. This congress of your party will surely be recorded in history as a new milestone in the socialist cause of the Hungarian people.
    The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is loyal to Marxism-Leninism, firmly leads the socialist cause of Hungary, firmly struggles to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to oppose modern revisionism, and, together with the socialist countries, is making great efforts to safeguard peace in Europe and the world. All this makes the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party fully respected in the international communist ranks.
    Now, the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are vigorously developing socialist construction. Socialism is like the rising sun, shining brightly. At the same time, following Asia, the national liberation movements in Africa and Latin America are also continuing to rise. The world situation is becoming more and more favorable to the cause of peace of the people of the world, and unfavorable to the imperialist forces of aggression and war. The peace policy of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union has won the enthusiastic support of the people of the world. Recently, Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States made a great contribution to easing international tensions and maintaining world peace. The Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament has been welcomed and supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. Due to the fundamental changes in the international balance of class forces, there have been some signs of easing of international tensions. However, it is worth noting that the powerful groups in the United States and other Western countries, while talking about peace in words, have not only not abandoned their policies of aggression and war in practice, but are also trying to instigate reactionaries in various countries, maintain tension around the world, intensify the atmosphere of the Cold War, and undermine the peaceful efforts of the socialist camp. As everyone knows, the United States is still continuing to expand military bases in Europe and Asia, and is intensifying its support for West German militarism and the revival of Japanese militarism. After manipulating the United Nations General Assembly to pass a resolution on the so-called Tibet issue, the United States has now passed a resolution to include the so-called Hungarian issue on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. Under this situation, all peace-loving countries and people in the world must further unite, carry out persistent struggles, be free from the instigation and deception of the imperialist forces of aggression and war, and maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of reactionaries in various countries. Only in this way, we believe, will the cause of peace of the people of the world surely achieve greater victories, and the war policies and aggression policies of the imperialist reactionaries will surely suffer greater failures.
    Comrades! The people of China and Hungary have a deep fraternal friendship. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are watching the struggle of the Hungarian people with great concern and sympathy, and are happy for every achievement of the Hungarian people in socialist construction, regarding it as a victory for our common cause.
    In recent years, under the guidance of the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results put forward by the Communist Party of China, our people have created a situation of continuous leap forward in economic construction, and have realized the people's commune system in rural areas. Recently, the people of the whole country have warmly responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, and have rapidly launched a new upsurge of a mass movement to increase production and practice economy. We can complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year. Not long ago, the people of our country happily reviewed the achievements of the past ten years, and looked forward to the future with full confidence. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of our country will continue to leap forward, strive to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in about ten years or less, and strive to build our country into a socialist country

    匈牙利社会主义建设前景光辉灿烂
    中国人民为匈牙利的成就感到高兴
    谭震林同志在匈牙利党代会上致词亲爱的同志们：
    我们中国共产党代表团，受中国共产党中央委员会的委托，代表全体中国人民和全体中国共产党党员，向匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会表示热烈的祝贺，并且通过大会向兄弟的匈牙利人民和匈牙利社会主义工人党表示衷心的敬意。
    匈牙利人民在匈牙利工人阶级领导下，以匈牙利共产党人为核心，为匈牙利的革命事业和社会主义事业进行了长期的不屈不挠的斗争。在经历了艰难曲折的、光荣的战斗道路以后，在匈牙利建立了人民政权，完成了民主改革，开展了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，使匈牙利成为伟大的社会主义阵营的一员。
    1956年，匈牙利工人阶级和劳动人民又一次经受了严重的考验。当时以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府，在苏联的兄弟般的援助和全世界一切进步力量的支持下，粉碎了外国帝国主义和国内反革命势力所发动的反革命暴乱，捍卫了匈牙利人民的社会主义事业。这场严重考验，不仅使匈牙利人民获得教训，而且使社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界无产阶级都获得教训。
    三年来，匈牙利社会主义工人党根据过去时期的阶级斗争和经济建设的经验，在思想战线上和政治战线上进行了艰巨的斗争。在这个斗争中，党的队伍变得更加坚强了，工人阶级的阵地更加巩固了，广大人民也越来越亲密地团结在党的周围。三年来，匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党的领导下，不但迅速地恢复了国民经济，而且以更高的速度继续发展着社会主义建设。人民的生活水平不断地在提高。农业的社会主义改造也取得了巨大的进展。现在，匈牙利人民正在胜利地执行着发展国民经济的三年计划。这个计划的超额完成，将为新的五年计划创造更高的起点，加速匈牙利的社会主义建设。
    在匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会上，将要讨论中央关于经济任务和制订第二个五年计划的指标。新的五年计划的指标指明，到1965年，工业将比1958年增长65％到70％，农业将比1954—1958年的平均水平提高30％到32％，农业的社会主义改造将胜利完成，人民的生活水平将有进一步的提高，从而在匈牙利人民面前展现着经济和文化的新高涨的灿烂图景。你们党的这次代表大会，必将成为匈牙利人民社会主义事业的一个新的里程碑而载入史册。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党忠于马克思列宁主义，坚强地领导着匈牙利的社会主义事业，坚定地为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和反对现代修正主义而斗争，并且同各社会主义国家一起为维护欧洲和世界的和平进行着重大的努力。这一切都使匈牙利社会主义工人党在国际共产主义队伍里受到充分的尊敬。
    现在，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国都在蓬蓬勃勃地发展着社会主义建设。社会主义有如旭日东升，光芒万丈。与此同时，继亚洲之后，非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动也正在继续不断地高涨。世界形势愈来愈有利于世界人民的和平事业，而不利于帝国主义侵略势力和战争势力。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的和平政策赢得了全世界人民的热烈拥护。最近，赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国，对缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平作出了巨大贡献。苏联提出的全面彻底裁军的建议，获得了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的欢迎和支持。由于国际阶级力量的对比发生了根本的变化，国际紧张局势开始出现了某些趋向缓和的迹象。但是，值得注意的是，美国和其他西方国家的有势力集团尽管一面在口头上讲着和平，一面在实际上却不但没有放弃他们的侵略政策和战争政策，而且还力图鼓动各国反动派，在世界各地保持紧张局势，加剧冷战气氛，破坏社会主义阵营的和平努力。大家知道，美国现在还继续在欧洲和亚洲扩大军事基地，并且加紧扶植西德军国主义和复活日本军国主义。美国在操纵联合国大会通过了关于所谓西藏问题的决议以后，现在又通过了把所谓匈牙利问题列入联合国大会议程。在这种形势下，全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民必须进一步团结起来，进行坚持不懈的斗争，不受帝国主义侵略势力和战争势力的挑拨和欺骗，并且对各国反动派的阴谋保持高度的警惕。只要这样，我们相信，世界人民的和平事业必将取得更大的胜利，而帝国主义反动派的战争政策和侵略政策必将遭到更大的失败。
    同志们！中匈两国人民具有深厚的兄弟友谊。中国共产党和中国人民以极大的关怀和同情，注视着匈牙利人民的斗争，为匈牙利人民在社会主义建设中的每一个成就而感到高兴，把它看作是我们的共同事业的胜利。
    近年来，我国人民在中国共产党提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的照耀下，开创了经济建设持续跃进的局面，并且实现了农村的人民公社化。最近，全国人民热烈响应中国共产党的八届八中全会的号召，反右倾，鼓干劲，又迅速地掀起了一个新的群众性的增产节约运动的高潮。我们可以在今年提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。我国人民不久前以欢欣的心情回顾了过去十年的成就，并且充满信心地瞻望着未来。我国人民将在中国共产党的领导下，继续不断地跃进，争取在十年左右或者更短的时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国，为把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    我国人民所已经取得的成就，是同伟大的苏联、同匈牙利人民共和国和其他兄弟国家的援助和支持分不开的。我们相信，中匈两国在政治、经济和文化方面的互助合作必将继续发展，我们两国人民的友谊和团结必将日益加强和巩固。我们两国人民的友谊和团结，以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的友谊和团结，都是建立在共同理想和共同事业的基础之上的，它是永恒的，牢不可破的。维护这种伟大的友谊和团结是我们共同的最崇高的国际义务。
    现在，请允许我向大会宣读中国共产党中央委员会的贺电。（贺电全文见第一版）
