Xinhua News Agency, December 7th. A commemoration meeting was held in the capital's literary and art circles today to mark the 50th anniversary of the birth of Bulgarian revolutionary poet Nikola Vaptsarov. The commemoration meeting was jointly organized by the Sino-Bulgarian Friendship Association, the Chinese Writers Association, and the Beijing Library. Xiao San, a council member of the Chinese Writers Association and a poet, said in his speech: Vaptsarov was an outstanding and talented revolutionary poet of Bulgaria, a staunch revolutionary, and an anti-fascist fighter. He was only thirty-three years old when he was heroically martyred in 1942. His fiery and enthusiastic verses spread from the guerrillas, from the prison, and from the execution ground, and were widely recited by the people. Xiao San said: Vaptsarov is a poet, a Communist Party member (formerly a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Workers' Party). The qualities of a soldier and a poet are integrated in Vaptsarov, which is a model for a new type of poet of our era. Xiao San said: Bulgaria has produced many outstanding poets and writers, making valuable contributions to the world's cultural treasures. He finally wished the Bulgarian people's political, economic, and cultural life would become increasingly prosperous, and wished the great friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people would develop day by day.

    Ge Baoquan, a council member of the Chinese Writers Association, introduced Vaptsarov's life and his immortal poems in the collection "Motor Songs" at the meeting. He said: Vaptsarov dedicated his life to the revolution, using his heroic revolutionary struggle and passionate poetry to write the most glorious pages in the history of the Bulgarian people's revolutionary struggle and the development of revolutionary poetry. He said: In 1953, the World Peace Council posthumously awarded Vaptsarov the honorary prize of the International Peace Prize. Vaptsarov's poems are being widely recited among the people of our country.

    Bulgarian Ambassador to China, Panchevski, said in his speech at the meeting: Today's commemoration meeting vividly demonstrates once again the increasing cultural ties between our two peoples and the unbreakable Sino-Bulgarian friendship. He said: Vaptsarov's poems have been published in several editions in China and are warmly welcomed by readers, which shows that these poems have immortal artistic power, and its source lies in the poet's communist worldview, his revolutionary training, and his firm belief in the new era.

    After the meeting, Vaptsarov's poems "Belief," "Motherland," and "We Want to Build Factories" were recited, and the film "Song of Man," depicting the poet's life, was shown. Simultaneously with the commemoration meeting, an exhibition of pictures about the poet's life was also held.
