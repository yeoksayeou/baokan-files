Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 18th: Fujian Province has already completed its annual grain procurement task ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. After inspection, over 90% of the grain stored meets the prescribed quality standards.

Fujian Province had a bumper grain harvest this year, and the Party committees at all levels grasped the grain procurement work tightly and early. The people's communes in various places conducted socialist education for their members, and the socialist consciousness of the members was unprecedentedly enhanced. They adopted the method of harvesting, threshing, selling, and transporting grain simultaneously, and actively sold grain to the state. Forty-four counties and cities across the province had overfulfilled the annual grain procurement task when only about half of the autumn grain was harvested.

While procuring grain, all localities have also conscientiously arranged the lives of commune members, first grasping grain distribution, and reserving sufficient rations for commune members from now until the new grain is available next year, according to the prescribed standards. They also implemented the method of rationing by person, centralized storage, assigning quotas to households, eating with tickets, and keeping savings for themselves. Seeds and feed for collectively raised livestock were also reserved according to regulations and centrally managed by the production teams.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 18th: As of the 14th, Jiangsu Province had exceeded its annual grain procurement task by 4.4%. The quality of the stored grain meets the standards.

Jiangsu Province's completion of this year's grain procurement task quickly and well is the result of Party committees at all levels adhering to the principle of secretaries taking the lead and launching mass movements. After overcoming severe droughts and other natural disasters and achieving a bumper grain harvest, all localities ensured that each harvest was seized upon, and the procurement task was completed ahead of schedule for each crop.

In the procurement process, Jiangsu localities paid attention to correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the commune members, and reasonably reserved sufficient rations, seeds, feed, and reserve grain for commune members. The reserve grain of various communes in grain-producing areas has increased. Party committees in various localities are further arranging the lives of commune members, educating them to use grain in a planned way, and live frugally. Taicang County conducted propaganda and education among the masses, emphasizing that a good harvest should not be forgotten when saving grain. All 2,361 public canteens in the county have formulated annual and monthly grain consumption plans and have generally improved the grain management system.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 17th: Heilongjiang Province has already completed its annual grain procurement plan ahead of schedule. After inspection, more than 90% of the procured grain is of the first grade. While delivering grain, people's communes in various places have reasonably reserved sufficient rations, seeds, feed, and reserve grain for commune members, and have properly arranged the lives of commune members.

Heilongjiang Province, which has always had a high grain commodity rate, has further increased the grain commodity rate this year because the people's communes have implemented the policy of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production, implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture in agricultural production, gave full play to the power of agricultural machinery, and extensively promoted improved agricultural tools, resulting in a bumper harvest of grain crops. Before the realization of communization, the province's grain commodity rate was generally around 42%, but this year it reached 46%. Baiquan County, which uses more agricultural machinery, has a grain commodity rate closer to 60% this year.

    各地在征购粮食的同时，都认真地安排好社员生活，首先抓好了粮食分配，按照规定标准留足了从现在到明年新粮登场时为止的社员口粮，并且实行以人定量，集中保管，指标到户，凭票吃饭，节约归己的办法，种子和集体饲养的牲畜饲料也按照规定留足，集中由生产队保管。
    新华社南京18日电　江苏省到14日止，已超额4.4％完成了今年度的粮食征购任务。入库粮食的质量符合标准。
    江苏省今年的粮食征购任务完成得又快又好，是各级党委坚持书记挂帅，开展群众运动的结果。各地在战胜严重干旱等自然灾害，获得粮食大丰收以后，对征购工作都做到了上来一熟抓一熟，熟熟提前完成征购任务。
    江苏各地在征购中，注意正确处理国家、集体和社员三者之间的关系，合理留足了社员口粮、种子、饲料和储备粮。产粮区各公社的储备粮都有了增加。各地党委正在进一步安排社员生活，教育社员有计划地用粮，细水长流过日子。太仓县在群众中进行丰收不忘节约粮食的宣传教育，全县二千三百六十一个公共食堂全部订好了年度和各月的用粮计划，并且普遍健全粮食管理制度。
    新华社哈尔滨17日电　黑龙江省已经提前完成今年度的粮食征购计划。征购的粮食经过检验，一等粮占90％以上。各地人民公社在交售粮食的同时，都合理地留足社员口粮、种子、饲料和储备粮，妥善地安排社员的生活。
    粮食商品率一向较高的黑龙江省，由于人民公社今年贯彻执行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，在农业生产中贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，充分发挥农业机械的威力，大量地推广改良农具，使粮食作物获得丰收，从而进一步提高了粮食的商品率。在实现公社化以前，全省粮食商品率一般在42％左右，而今年达到了46％。使用农业机械较多的拜泉县，今年的粮食商品率更接近到60％。
