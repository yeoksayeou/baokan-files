　　Smelt More Steel for the Country
　　Li Weixian, shift leader of Qingdao Second Steel Plant, advanced producer of Qingdao City
    A year ago, I was just an ordinary iron-smelting worker. In 1958, the mass movement of large-scale steel production blossomed all over the country, and Qingdao City also engaged in it in a vigorous and lively manner. I also gloriously joined the ranks of steel warriors.
    Looking back on my personal experience in participating in large-scale steel production over the past year, I have deeply realized the correctness of the Party's General Line and the "indigenous methods combined with foreign methods" policy is a good policy for developing industry at high speed. Take the Qingdao Fifth Steel Plant, where I used to work, for example. If indigenous methods had not been adopted first, it would not have developed so quickly. It was because we first had experience operating indigenous furnaces that we were able to quickly master the technology of operating foreign furnaces.
    I also remember that since the steelmaking workshop of "Fifth Steel" started operations in April, the output and quality were not very good for a period of time. The general daily output was only forty to fifty tons, especially the three shifts could not maintain continuous high production. Since August, the Party committee of the factory and the branch of the workshop conducted research and analysis on the situation of fluctuating output and quality at that time, and found that in addition to some confusion in raw material management, the prominent reason was that the cooperation between shifts and between processes within the shift was not good enough, so the previous shift achieved high output, but the next shift dropped again. Since the leaders proposed to carry out "one-dragon" collaboration competitions in depth and strengthen the communist cooperation between upper and lower processes and between shifts, we have all guaranteed to "leave the difficulties to ourselves and send the convenience to others." Everyone paid attention to preparing for the next shift. In this way, it was possible to twist the upper, lower, left, and right into one rope, link one ring to another, and tighten each ring, realizing high-temperature rapid production. I remember that on September 18th, Shift B produced 26.25 tons of steel. After we comrades of Shift C took over, on the one hand, we congratulated Shift B, and on the other hand, we immediately studied and adopted measures to increase production, and as a result, we created a new record of 33.2 tons of output per shift; at the same time, we prepared everything for the production of the next shift, and Shift A also reached a high level of 28.25 tons. On this day, the daily output of our 1.2-ton small converter reached 87.7 tons. Later, it once created a high production record of more than 100 tons, and the quality has always been stable at more than 90%. Therefore, our workshop gloriously attended the National "Heroes' Meeting"; the entire factory also completed the national plan 78 days ahead of schedule, and obtained the glorious title of Red Flag Factory.
    In order to better arrange the city's steel production, the higher authorities merged "Fifth Steel" into Qingdao Second Steel Plant in December, and I was assigned to work as the shift leader in the first steelmaking workshop. The factory buildings and various equipment of "Second Steel" are much better than those of "Fifth Steel", and I believe that the production results will be better than "Fifth Steel". Therefore, I am determined to learn humbly and work with everyone to re-insert the red flag of "Fifth Steel" into the first workshop of "Second Steel" and produce more and better steel in 1960.

### 为国家炼更多的钢

　　为国家炼更多的钢
　　青岛市先进生产者青岛第二钢铁厂值班长  李维贤
    一年以前，我还是一个普通的化铁工人。1958年群众性的大办钢铁运动在全国遍地开了花，青岛市也搞得轰轰烈烈、热热闹闹，我也光荣地参加了钢铁战士的队伍。
    回想起一年来自己亲身参加大办钢铁的经历，我深深体会到党的总路线的正确，深深体会到“土洋并举”的方针是高速度发展工业的好方针。就拿我原来工作的单位—青岛第五钢铁厂来说吧，如果不是土法先上马，就不会很快地发展起来。我们就是因为先有一套操作土炉子的经验，所以才能够很快掌握操作洋炉子的技术。
    我还记得：“五钢”的炼钢车间，自从4月份上马以来，在一段时间内产量质量都不算好，一般的日产量只有四十至五十吨，特别是三班不能连续高产。自8月份以来，厂党委和车间支部针对当时产量、质量忽升忽降的情况，进行了研究分析，发现除了原料管理有些混乱外，突出的原因在于上下班之间、班内工序之间协作得不够好，所以造成上一班高产，下一班又降下来。自从领导方面提出要深入开展“一条龙”协作赛，加强上下工序之间、班与班之间的共产主义大协作以后，我们都保证：“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”。大家都注意为下一班做好准备工作。这样便作到了上下左右拧成一股绳，一环扣一环，环环扣紧，实现了高温快速生产。我记得在9月18日那一天，乙班产钢二十六点二五吨，我们丙班同志接班以后，一方面向乙班道喜，另一方面立即研究采取措施提高产量，结果创造了班产三十三点二吨的新纪录；我们同时为下一班的生产作好了一切准备工作，甲班也达到了二十八点二五吨的高产水平。这一天，我们的一点二吨的小转炉日产量达到八十七点七吨。以后又曾经创造了一百吨以上的高产纪录，质量也一直稳定在90％以上。因此，我们车间光荣地出席了全国“群英会”；全厂也提前七十八天完成了国家计划，取得了红旗厂的光荣称号。
    上级为了更好地安排全市钢铁生产，在12月份把“五钢”合并到青岛第二钢铁厂来了，我被分配到第一炼钢车间担任值班长的工作。“二钢”的厂房和各种设备都比“五钢”好得多，我相信生产成绩会比“五钢”更好。因此，我下了决心，一定要虚心学习，和大家一起，把“五钢”的红旗再插到“二钢”的第一车间，在1960年生产出更多更好的钢来。
