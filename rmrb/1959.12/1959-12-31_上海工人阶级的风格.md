　　The Style of the Shanghai Working Class
　　By our reporters He Changhua and Zhang Jiachi

　　"Once theory grasps the masses, it becomes a material force." -- Marx

　　The national situation is infinitely good, the whole country is red, and the good news of the early completion of the 1959 industrial production plan is coming from everywhere. Shanghai, one of China's largest industrial bases, has also completed the state-specified annual industrial output value target 21 days ahead of schedule, achieving a great victory in continuing the better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward.

　　Exceeding the plan by a few percentage points, and how much more steel, heavy machinery, cotton yarn, and paper have been produced than in the Great Leap Forward of 1958... These are certainly the rich fruits of Shanghai's continued leap forward in 1959, but merely listing the figures is far from enough to show the great victory of the continued leap forward in 1959. In this year, the Party's General Line has deeply rooted itself in the hearts of the people and become the conscious ideological weapon of the Shanghai working class, causing tremendous changes in their spiritual outlook. The communist style is emitting an unprecedentedly brilliant light in the sky of this large industrial city. This cannot be calculated by any units of measurement such as tons, meters, and percentages, and it is the source of creating such abundant material wealth in the continued leap forward of 1959.

　　During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Party's General Line liberated the minds of the Shanghai working class. They broke down superstitions, promoted the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, broke into the scientific "forbidden zone" that had existed for thousands of years, and climbed the peaks of technology. They automatically requested the abolition of piece-rate wages, wanting politics to be in command, not money. In the continued leap forward of 1959, the General Line took even deeper root in their hearts, and the Shanghai working class became more conscious and their style became even higher. When the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, they further developed the communist spirit of great collaboration. People were not only striving forward themselves, but also closely holding the hands of their class brothers and marching forward with their heads held high.

　　Defend the General Line and Uphold High Speed

　　Countless examples in life tell people how great a role people's ideology and spiritual outlook can play in class struggle and in the struggle to transform nature!

　　Ni Haibao, an ordinary weaving worker at the No. 9 State Cotton Mill, is quite honest, with a dark face, like a girl from the countryside. However, the General Line turned her into a giant of wisdom and courage. In order to increase the production of cotton cloth more, faster, better, and more economically, she and the workers in the workshop greatly increased the speed of the more than 60-year-old machine. But after the speed increased, the number of thread breaks increased. She thought, "I have two hands, I'm not afraid of the machine not listening to me." She came to work one or two hours early, and she was unwilling to leave the workshop after work. She also sped up her hands and feet when operating. She also studied the laws of work and how to rationally use every second of time in production. At this time, a second has its special meaning, which is directly related to the fate of "high speed." She painstakingly studied and innovated operating techniques to adapt to the new situation after high speed. She eliminated three movements in shuttle changing, shortening the time for changing a shuttle from 2.7 seconds to 1.8 seconds. The time for changing two shuttles can be used to change three shuttles. She also tried every possible way to make the thread joints fast, and practiced thread joining before and after meetings and during breaks. Sometimes she fell asleep in bed at night, still holding the yarn end in her hand. Her fingers were cut by the yarn, so she applied a "band-aid" and continued to practice hard. Thus, she also reduced the time for handling downtime from 11 seconds to 5.8 seconds.

　　In order to defend the General Line and uphold high speed, this ordinary female worker showed a high degree of loyalty to the cause of revolution and construction. Among the more than one million workers in Shanghai, there are many "Ni Haibao" who defended the General Line on the issues of combining indigenous and foreign methods, a comprehensive leap forward in achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, and a high-speed leap forward, and similarly demonstrated unparalleled determination and courage.

　　Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods to Deploy a Massive Ant Assault

　　In 1959, the Shanghai workers insisted on implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and developed the movement of making indigenous machine tools on a large scale in 1958. From January to November, they manufactured 10,100 new indigenous machine tools and simple equipment, solving many key problems in production. The workers of the Construction Machinery Factory greatly developed the experience of "ants gnawing at bones" in 1958 and deployed a massive "ant assault" in the factory. They transformed the original single "ant" (indigenous machine tool) that gnawed at (processed) a single "bone" (part) into a large group of "ants" simultaneously surrounding and "gnawing" at many "bones." They changed the indigenous machine tools from special-purpose to general-purpose, changed manual tool feeding to automatic tool feeding, and changed single-tool cutting to multi-tool multi-edge and whirlwind cutting. Moreover, one machine could be used for multiple purposes, giving the "ants" wings and turning "gnawing" bones into "swallowing" bones. Precisely because they adhered to the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, they were able to ensure that the annual output value plan was completed 48 days ahead of schedule and to undertake the more complex and heavier tasks of manufacturing rolling mill equipment, fertilizer equipment, smelting equipment, and other heavy machinery than in 1958.

　　The workers of the Xinzhong Power Machine Factory used their own hands to equip an indigenous machine tool assembly line for manufacturing gasoline engine connecting rods, solving the key problem of insufficient connecting rod production capacity. However, there were still some quality defects in the parts processed by these indigenous machine tools, totaling 24. A few people were ideologically wavering and advocated stopping the use of the indigenous machine tool assembly line and still using the old method of processing with foreign machine tools. The workers firmly disagreed, believing that defects could be improved. They immediately took action and modified and repaired these indigenous machine tools in a short period of time, overcoming 23 defects at once.

　　Greet Difficulties with a Smile; Victory Lies Behind Difficulties

　　"Greet difficulties with a smile" is another important manifestation of the new style of the Shanghai working class. They understand that to realize their great ambitions and to accomplish shocking revolutionary undertakings, they will inevitably encounter countless difficulties. They are high-spirited, full of vigor, and tenaciously repelled all obstacles on the road to the Great Leap Forward, achieving a great victory in 1959.

　　Let's see how the workers of the No. 6 Steel Plant greeted difficulties with a smile! This is a "poor" factory with "nest"-like factory buildings and equipment, a large number of "new recruits," and raw materials for steelmaking that are 90% high-sulfur indigenous iron, and the coke used for melting iron is also indigenous coke. How can we achieve a Great Leap Forward under such conditions? However, the workers said: We will not do shameful things; we will make good steel with good materials, and we will make good steel with bad materials. As long as it is iron, no matter what kind of iron it is, we will make it into good steel! They also said: Behind difficulties is the Great Leap Forward, is victory. They were as happy to see difficulties as they were to see the seedlings of the Great Leap Forward. They put forward the heroic slogan of "Making High Sulfur Bow Its Head and Turning Indigenous Iron into Steel" and launched a fierce and continuous offensive against high sulfur. The supply and marketing personnel ran to the station day and night, rushing to take samples from the transported pig iron for the factory's laboratory personnel to test and grasp the "enemy situation." The pig iron they used came from more than 50 places and there were more than 100 kinds, with widely varying chemical compositions, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. They used them together, complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses. The factory director followed the labor in the stockyard, and together with the workers, stacked the pig iron of various components in batches to facilitate batching. Finally, they grasped the temper of indigenous iron and indigenous coke, made high sulfur bow its head, and passed the "indigenous iron gate." After that, they successively conquered the "blast furnace technology gate," the "converter furnace life gate," and the "first-class steel gate," creating many valuable steelmaking experiences.

　　They also often boldly imagined: Can we use high-sulfur pig iron to make high-quality welding rod steel? Can we expand the output of a converter with a design capacity of only three tons to four tons or five tons? After the daily output of steel reaches 300 tons, can we leap forward again to 400 tons? After it reaches 400 tons, can we leap forward again to 500 tons? ... They not only "greet difficulties with a smile," but also tried every possible way to find difficulties for themselves, set new goals for struggle, and then realize them one by one, constantly revolutionizing and constantly advancing. Now they have won a complete victory for the whole year, completing the 1959 national steelmaking plan 28 days ahead of schedule; the converter utilization coefficient (fixed furnace seat) has leaped from 11.68 at the beginning of the year to 25; the steel qualification rate is stabilized at 98%; the pig iron consumption per ton of steel is only about 1,280 kilograms, raising the red flag of achieving a comprehensive leap forward in high yield, high quality, and low consumption with high-sulfur pig iron in the country.

　　This is really: with difficulty at the head, it is difficult to move an inch; with work at the head, one can travel thousands of miles a day.

　　Joyfully Watching Green Leaves Become Peonies

　　After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the National "Heroes Conference" was held not long after. "One flower does not make a spring; a riot of color does," in order to complete the plan ahead of schedule and strive for everyone to be advanced, a mass upsurge of communist collaboration appeared throughout Shanghai. The mass movement of "the advanced helping the backward, and the backward catching up with the advanced" quickly developed from people to people, from groups to groups, to factories to factories, and was promoted to the whole district and the whole city. The slogan of "not letting a comrade fall behind" and "not letting a brother factory fall behind" resounded in every corner.

　　Cao Huiju raised a bright red flag. She enthusiastically helped backward class partners catch up with her noble qualities, and was praised by more and more people, becoming an example for everyone to learn from.

　　"Joyfully watching green leaves become peonies" is a vivid summary of Cao Huiju's style. Cao Huiju is a 23-year-old grinding worker at the Shanghai Sewing Machine Needle Factory, and a fast hand. When she heard that the Yonghe Needle Factory had tight tasks, she took the initiative to ask to go to this factory to do voluntary labor. In the spring of 1959, she was finally transferred to support it. As soon as she arrived at the Yonghe Factory, she worked side by side with Kong Zili, a female worker who had always been called a "slow hand at grinding." Kong Zili's production situation was indeed not good. Her output was half lower than others, and she produced more defective products, so she often frowned and even secretly shed tears. Cao Huiju knew that Kong Zili was not willingly falling behind, so not only did she not blame her, but she also treated her difficulties as her own and enthusiastically helped her overcome them. Cao Huiju first used her own method of doing more work to make up for Kong Zili's shortfall and complete the team's plan. Of course, this could not solve the fundamental problem. She found that Kong Zili's machine was not easy to use and was very difficult to operate, so she replaced it with a light and flexible machine that she used herself, and helped her master the grinding skills hand in hand. Cao Huiju also found that Kong Zili had many children at home. Although she also had two children, she was taken care of by her mother-in-law, so she suggested that she work the day shift and she would work the night shift. Cao Huiju's communist style of selflessness deeply moved Kong Zili. Other workers in the team were also greatly educated, and everyone came to help Kong Zili. Kong Zili herself was of course particularly hardworking, secretly determined to strive for progress and to improve production in response to the concern of her comrades. In this way, the title of Red Flag Bearer, which had always been held by Cao Huiju, was transferred to Kong Zili in May. Some people said that Cao Huiju was a "big fool," but Cao Huiju was even happier than when she had won the red flag herself, and rushed to Kong Zili's house at night to report the good news. On this day, Kong Zili was sick, so Cao Huiju stayed at her house to take care of her. At night, Cao Huiju could not fall asleep for a long time. She felt that Kong Zili's biggest difficulty was that no one took care of her housework. Thinking about it, she got out of bed and secretly washed the children's diapers for Kong Zili, mopped the floor, and took care of everything properly before tiptoeing to close the door and go to work in the factory. What moved people about Cao Huiju was not only that she regarded helping others as her greatest pleasure, but also that when the difficulties that came from this pressed down on her, she had no complaints. Since the change of machines, Cao Huiju's output and quality have declined sharply, but after her hard work, she was re-evaluated as a Red Flag Bearer after June. She also led the entire team to unite as one and become an advanced team. At this time, it was no longer one flower blooming alone, but many flowers blooming on the branches.

　　People often use "Peonies are good, but they still need green leaves to support them" to encourage advanced figures not to separate themselves from the masses. The limitations of this sentence have been broken by the heroes of the Mao Zedong era. They are no longer satisfied with being the peony, the king of flowers, and letting others be green leaves, but use their own practical actions to help the people around them, so that the backward become advanced and the green leaves become peonies. Cao Huiju is such a person.

　　After Cao Huiju's advanced ideas and deeds were greatly promoted before and after the "Heroes Conference," they burned fiercely throughout the city like wildfire. Many workers in the "compare, learn, catch up, and help" competition learned from Cao Huiju, promoted the communist style of helping others, and powerfully promoted the development of a new upsurge in production where you learn from me and I help you to improve together.

　　Isn't the style shown by Cao Huiju the unique class characteristic of the working class! Apart from the far-sighted working class, what other class in the world can have such heroism! It is not terrible to be temporarily backward; what is terrible is to be content with being backward. The spirit of not being willing to fall behind, as shown by Kong Zili, also shines with the light of the excellent qualities of the working class and is equally praised by people.

　　The reason why the advanced thinking represented by Cao Huiju can grow rapidly and spread rapidly is inseparable from the Party's General Line. The General Line greatly stimulated the communist consciousness of the working class. The advanced elements first realized that taking on the important task of building the motherland cannot be accomplished by one person or a few people single-handedly. If the broad masses did not have the same urgent desire as Cao Huiju, it would be unimaginable to allow the sprouts of this communist ideology to grow into a lush tree in a short period of time.

　　How great is the power unleashed when the masses are armed with the ideas of the General Line!

　　At the end of the year, people are reviewing the changes of the past year with excitement. 1959 was an extraordinary year, a year of continued leap forward after 1958. With this year's training and improvement, the Shanghai working class is full of enthusiasm and confidence in the continued leap forward of 1960! (Attached picture)

　　上海工人阶级的风格
　　本报记者　贺昌华　张家炽
    “理论一旦把握了民众，它也就变成物质力量。”——马克思
    全国形势无限好，万里江山一片红，提前完成1959年工业生产计划的捷报到处传来。我国最大工业基地之一的上海，也已经提前二十一天完成了国家规定的全年工业总产值指标，取得了继续更好更全面地跃进的巨大胜利。
    超额完成计划百分之几，比大跃进的1958年又增产了多少钢材、重型机械、棉纱、纸张……，这固然是1959年上海工业继续跃进的丰硕果实，但仅仅罗列数目字，远不足以表明1959年继续跃进的巨大胜利。这一年中，党的总路线深入人心，成为上海工人阶级的自觉的思想武器，引起了精神面貌的巨大变化，共产主义风格在上海这个大工业城市的上空放出空前灿烂的光芒。这是吨、米、百分比一切度量衡单位所无法计算的，是1959年继续跃进中创造如此丰富的物质财富的源泉。
    1958年大跃进的日子里，党的总路线解放了上海工人阶级的思想。他们破除迷信，发扬了敢想敢说敢作的共产主义精神，闯进了千百年来的科学“禁地”，攀登着技术的高峰。他们自动要求取消计件工资，要政治挂帅，不要钞票挂帅。在继续跃进的1959年，总路线更在他们的心上扎了根，上海工人阶级的觉悟更高了，风格更高了。当党的八届八中全会发出提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大号召的时候，他们更高度地发扬了共产主义大协作精神，人们不仅仅自己奋勇前进，而是紧紧携着阶级弟兄的手一起昂首前进了。
    捍卫总路线　坚持高速度
    生活中无数的事例告诉人们：人的意识形态，人的精神面貌，在阶级斗争中，在改造自然界的斗争中，能起多么巨大的作用呵！
    倪海宝，国棉九厂一个普通的织布女工，人挺老实，黑黑的面孔，像个农村里的姑娘。可是，总路线使她变成一个智勇双全的巨人。为了多快好省地增产棉布，她和车间工人把六十多年的老机器的车速大大加快了。但车速加快以后，断头增多，她想：“我有两只手，不怕你机器不听话”。上班她早来一、二小时，下班她不肯离开车间，操作时也加快了手脚。她又研究工作规律，怎样合理运用生产中一分一秒的时间。一秒钟，在这时候有它特殊的意义，它直接关系着“高速”的命运。她苦心钻研，革新操作技术，来适应高速以后的新情况。她省去了换梭中的三个动作，使换梭的时间从二点七秒钟缩短到一点八秒，换两只梭子的时间能换三只梭。她还千方百计地使头接得快，在开会前后、休息时间就练习接头。有时夜里在床上睡着了，手里还拿着纱头。手指给纱线割破了，用“橡皮膏”贴好继续苦练。于是她又使处理停台的时间从十一秒降低到五点八秒钟。
    为了捍卫总路线，坚持高速度，这个普通女工表现了对革命和建设事业高度的忠诚。在上海的一百多万工人群众中，有许许多多的“倪海宝”，他们在土洋并举、多快好省全面跃进、高速度跃进等方针问题上，捍卫了总路线，同样表现出无比的坚定和勇敢。
    土洋并举大摆蚂蚁阵
    上海工人在1959年坚持贯彻了土洋并举的方针，发展了1958年大搞土机床的运动。从1月到11月新制造了一万零一百台土机床和简易设备，解决了生产上许多关键问题。建设机器厂工人大大发展了1958年“蚂蚁啃骨头”的经验，在厂里大摆“蚂蚁阵”：他们把原来一只“蚂蚁”（土机床）一道道啃（加工）一块“骨头”（部件），发展为一大群一大群的“蚂蚁”，同时围“啃”好多块“骨头”。他们把土机床从专用改为通用，人力进刀改为自动进刀，单刀切削改为多刀多刃和旋风切削，而且还可以一床多用，使“蚂蚁”长上了翅膀，“啃”骨头变成了“吞”骨头。正因为坚持了土洋并举的方针，他们才保证了全年产值计划提前四十八天完成，担当了比1958年更复杂更繁重的制造轧钢设备、化肥设备、冶炼设备等重型机械任务。
    新中动力机厂工人用自己的双手，装备了一条制造汽油机连杆的土机床流水线，解决了连杆生产能力不足的关键。但是，这些土机床加工出的零件质量上还有一些缺点，集中起来有二十四个。有少数人思想不坚定，主张停用土机床流水线，仍用过去的老办法——洋机床来加工。工人们坚决不同意，认为有缺点可以改进，马上动手，短时间内就改装和修理好这些土机床，一下子克服了二十三个缺点。
    笑迎困难，困难背后是胜利
    “笑迎困难”，是上海工人阶级新风格的又一重要的表现。他们懂得，要实现自己的雄心大志，要干出惊心动魄的革命事业，必然会碰到无数的困难。他们斗志昂扬，精神抖擞，顽强地击退了跃进道路上的一切拦路虎，取得了1959年的巨大胜利。
    且看上钢六厂工人如何笑迎困难！这是一个“穷”厂，草“窝”似的厂房设备，大批的“新兵”，炼钢用的原料90％是高硫土铁，化铁用的焦炭又是土焦。这样的条件怎样实现大跃进？可是，工人群众却说：丢脸的事我们不干；来好料炼好钢，来坏料也要炼好钢，只要是铁，不管它是怎么样的铁，都要把它炼成好钢！他们还说：困难后面就是跃进，就是胜利。他们见到了困难，好比见到了跃进的苗头一样兴高采烈。他们提出了“叫高硫低头，要土铁成钢”的豪迈口号，向高硫发起了一场猛烈的持续不断的攻势。供销人员日日夜夜跑车站，赶忙从运来的生铁中取出样子，给厂里化验人员化验，掌握“敌情”。他们用的生铁，来自五十多个地方，有一百多种，化学成分千差万别，各有优点、也各有缺点，他们就互相搭配使用、互相取长补短。厂长下料场跟班劳动，和工人们一起把各种成分的生铁分批堆放，便于配料。终于他们摸到了土铁土焦的脾气，使高硫低了头，闯过了“吃土铁关”。之后又连连攻克了“化铁炉技术关”、“转炉炉龄关”和“钢的一级品关”，创造了不少宝贵的炼钢经验。
    他们还常常大胆设想：能不能用高硫生铁炼出优质电焊条钢？能不能把设计能力只有三吨的转炉产量扩大到四吨、五吨？钢的日产量到了三百吨以后能不能再跃进到四百吨？到了四百吨以后能不能再跃进到五百吨？……他们不仅“笑迎困难”，还千方百计给自己找来困难，树立新的奋斗目标，然后再一个个地去实现它们，不断革命，不断前进。现在他们已夺取了全年大捷，提前二十八天完成了1959年炼钢国家计划；转炉利用系数（固定式炉座）从年初的十一点六八，一跃再跃到二十五；钢的合格率稳定在98％；每吨钢的生铁耗用量只有一千二百八十公斤左右，在全国举起了用高硫生铁达到高产优质低耗全面跃进的红旗。
    这真是：难字当头，寸步难移；干字当头，日行万里。
    喜看绿叶成牡丹
    党的八届八中全会召开以后，不久又召开了全国“群英会”。“一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春”，为了提前完成计划和争取人人先进，上海全市出现了群众性的共产主义大协作的高潮。“先进帮后进，后进赶先进”的群众性运动，由人与人、小组与小组，迅速发展到工厂与工厂，推向全区和全市。“不让一个同伴掉队”，“不让一个兄弟厂掉队”的口号响彻各个角落。
    曹慧菊树起了一面鲜艳的红旗。她热情帮助后进的阶级伙伴赶上自己的高贵品质，受到了越来越多的人赞扬，成为大家学习的榜样。
    “喜看绿叶成牡丹”，是曹慧菊风格的生动的概括。曹慧菊是上海缝纫机制针厂二十三岁的磨平女工，是个快手。她听到永和制针厂任务紧，曾主动要求到这个厂去义务劳动。1959年春天她终于被调去支援了。一到永和厂，她就和一向被人称为“磨平慢手”的女工孔自力车挨车地工作。孔自力的生产情况确实不好，产量比别人低一半，废次品又出得多，因此常常愁眉苦脸，甚至偷偷地掉眼泪。曹慧菊知道孔自力并不是自甘落后，因此不但不责备她，还把她的困难当作自己的困难，热情地帮助她克服困难。曹慧菊首先用自己多做活的办法，来弥补孔自力的缺额，完成小组计划，这当然并不能解决根本问题。她发现孔自力的车子不好使，操作起来很吃力，便把自己用的一部轻巧灵活的车子换给她，并且手拉手地帮助她掌握磨平技巧。曹慧菊又发现孔自力家里孩子多，自己虽然也有两个孩子，但有婆婆照顾，就建议她做日班，自己作夜班。曹慧菊这种舍己为人的共产主义风格深深感动了孔自力。小组其他工人也受到很大教育，大家都来帮助孔自力。孔自力自己当然格外努力，暗暗下定了决心，要力争上游，要搞好生产来回答同志们的关怀。这样，一直由曹慧菊保持的红旗手称号，5月份就转移到孔自力。有人说曹慧菊是个“大傻瓜”，但曹慧菊却比自己得到红旗还要高兴，连夜赶到孔自力家里去报喜。这一天，孔自力病了，曹慧菊就住在她家里来照顾她。夜里，曹慧菊久久不能入寝，她感到孔自力最大的困难是家务没有人料理，想着想着，她从床上爬起来，偷偷地替孔自力洗小孩尿布，拖地板，一切料理得好好的，然后才蹑手蹑脚地关好门，到工厂去上工。曹慧菊感动人的地方，还不仅是把帮助别人当作自己最大的快乐，而且当因此而得来的困难压到自己头上的时候，也毫无怨言。自从调换车子以后，曹慧菊的产量和质量都直线下降了，但是经过她刻苦钻研，6月以后又重新被评为红旗手。她并且带动整个小组团结一致，成了先进小组。这时，已经不是一花独放，而是繁花满枝了。
    人们常常用“牡丹虽好，还要绿叶相扶”，来勉励先进人物不要脱离群众。这句话的局限性已经被毛泽东时代的英雄所突破。他们已不满足自己当花中之王的牡丹，别人作绿叶，而用自己的实际行动，帮助周围的人们，使后进变为先进，绿叶成了牡丹。曹慧菊正是这样的人。
    曹慧菊的先进思想和事迹在“群英会”前后大大发扬以后，如星火燎原般地在全市猛烈燃烧起来，很多工人在“比、学、赶、帮”的竞赛运动中，学习曹慧菊，发扬了助人为乐的共产主义风格，有力地推动了你学我帮、共同提高的生产新高潮的发展。
    曹慧菊所表现出的风格，不正是工人阶级所特有的阶级本色么！除了高瞻远瞩的工人阶级以外，世界上还有什么别的阶级能有这样的英雄气概呢！暂时落后并不可怕，可怕的是自甘落后。像孔自力所表现出的那种不甘落后的气概，同样闪耀出工人阶级优秀品质的光芒，同样受到了人们的赞扬。
    曹慧菊所代表的先进思想之所以能迅速成长，之所以能迅速传播开来，这是和党的总路线分不开的。总路线大大激发了工人阶级的共产主义觉悟，先进分子首先认识到要担负起建设祖国的重任，绝不是一个人或少数人匹马单枪所能胜任的。如果广大群众没有具备如曹慧菊同样迫切的愿望，要在短时间内使这种共产主义思想的萌芽成长为枝叶繁茂的大树，也是不可想像的。
    总路线的思想一武装了群众，所发挥出的威力是何等巨大！
    值此岁末，人们怀着激动的心情回顾了一年来的变化。1959年是不平凡的一年，是继1958年之后继续跃进的一年。有了这一年的锻炼和提高，上海工人阶级对1960年的继续跃进充满热情，满怀信心！（附图片）
