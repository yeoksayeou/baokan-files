Eight Provinces Pre-fulfill Annual Industrial Output Value Plans
The Party's Two-Legged Walking Policy Significantly Promotes Production Development
Labor Emulation and Technical Innovation Movements Greatly Increase Labor Productivity

Hebei

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 26th: The workers on the industrial front in Hebei Province have pre-fulfilled this year's total industrial output value plan on November 27th. As of December 20th, the province has overfulfilled the state plan for fifty major products, including steel, steel materials, pig iron, iron ore, coal, power machinery, cement, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth. All products have seen significant growth compared to last year. The quality of major products has reached or exceeded the national standards. The ash content of raw coal is 0.79% lower than the national plan, and the qualification rate of pig iron has increased month by month, averaging 80% in September and rising to 81.3% in October. The cost of products has also been greatly reduced.

　　Under the unified leadership of the Party, the industrial production front in Hebei Province has continuously opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted morale, vigorously promoted mass movements, and resolutely and comprehensively implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction. Workers have launched production increase and thrift campaigns, and technical innovations and inventions have emerged one after another. As of the end of November, workers across the province had put forward more than 8 million rationalization proposals and 91,453 technical innovation projects. The development of the production increase and thrift campaign has increased the average industrial labor productivity of the province by 13%.

　　The great achievements on the industrial front in Hebei Province this year once again demonstrate the correctness of the "combining indigenous and foreign methods," "combining large, medium, and small enterprises," and other two-legged walking policies put forward by the Party Central Committee. The local small-scale enterprises established during the Great Leap Forward last year have become an important force on the province's industrial front. After rectification and technical transformation, "small indigenous groups" iron smelting plants and cement plants have transitioned to "small foreign groups" this year and have exerted tremendous power. This year, 90% of the province's pig iron was produced by small blast furnaces. The province has achieved self-sufficiency in iron for steelmaking and casting, changing the historical reliance on other provinces for pig iron supply.

Jiangsu

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 26th: Good news from the industrial front in Jiangsu Province: this year's total industrial output value plan was pre-fulfilled by twenty-eight days. As of December 20th, the province has overfulfilled the annual total industrial output value plan by 10%. The output of fifty-three major products has pre-fulfilled and overfulfilled the annual plan, and all have increased significantly compared to last year. Steel, pig iron, internal combustion engines, chemical fertilizers, and cotton yarn have increased by 10% to 50% or more compared to last year.

　　The continued leap forward in industrial production in Jiangsu Province this year is the result of continuous encouragement and striving for excellence. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, workers across the province launched vigorous production increase and thrift team competitions, opponent competitions, counterpart competitions, linking competitions, and one-dragon competitions. Through the competition, many factories and mining enterprises achieved high yield, high quality, low cost, high efficiency, low consumption, and safe production. Tens of thousands of advanced units and advanced producers have emerged.

　　This year, the Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province resolutely implemented the policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward." On the one hand, they produced a large amount of pig iron to supply the province and support Shanghai and other places; on the other hand, they manufactured a large number of agricultural machines to promote agricultural production. This year, the area of farmland with electric irrigation and mechanical irrigation in the province expanded by 40% compared to last year.

Guangdong

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 26th: Guangdong Province pre-fulfilled its industrial output value plan for this year by seventeen days. As of the 20th, among the major products, forty-four, including steel, steel materials, pig iron, refractory materials, timber, cement, sulfuric acid, plastics, chemical pesticides, and cotton yarn, have completed or overfulfilled the annual production plan; the output of many major products has increased significantly compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, such as sulfuric acid, which increased by 96.1% compared to the total output last year, and cement, which increased by 28.6%. Product costs have also been significantly reduced.

　　Under the leadership of the Party, the workers on the industrial front in Guangdong Province have further implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of two-legged walking policies, and have deeply carried out the production increase and thrift movement, as well as the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, thereby achieving great victories in production. Especially since August, the implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, has made the production level higher month by month. The province's industrial output value increased by 22% in August compared to July, 34% in September compared to August, 10.6% in October compared to September, 23% in November compared to October, and 8.7% in mid-December compared to early December.

Zhejiang

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 26th: Zhejiang Province had exceeded by 4% and pre-fulfilled this year's total industrial output value plan by December 20th. Eighty-three products, including steel, pig iron, sulfuric acid, caustic soda, power generation, metal cutting machine tools, motors, silk, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, have all pre-fulfilled the annual plan; the output of various products has increased significantly compared to 1958. Product quality, cost, and labor productivity have made great progress. The utilization coefficient of blast furnaces has been increased to above one, the qualification rate of pig iron has been increased to above 90%, the first-class product rate of silk has been increased to 99.61%, the coal consumption of power plants has been reduced by 6.46% compared to the beginning of this year, and the labor productivity of production workers in enterprises above the county level from January to November has increased by 14% compared to last year.

　　Zhejiang Province has not only further tapped the production potential of existing enterprises this year, but has also built a number of new enterprises or workshops. The commissioning of new enterprises has significantly increased the province's industrial production capacity and greatly improved its technical level. Many products that had not been produced in the past have also been produced this year. For example, the metallurgical industry has refined high-quality steel, the machinery industry has trial-produced hundreds of new products, and the light industry has richer and more colorful new products, with more than a thousand types put into production successively.

　　The achievements made by the industrial front in Zhejiang Province this year are a victory for resolutely implementing the Party's general line under the leadership of the Party, and a victory for implementing the Party's complete set of two-legged walking policies. In the first few months of this year, many enterprises had already seen a new situation of all-round leap forward with high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the great call to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and practice production increase and thrift, the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and workers became even higher, and the production level continued to rise. Taking the total industrial output value of July as 100, August was 118.4, September reached 167, October was higher than September, and November was even higher than October. Many factories and mines entered 1960 two months, one and a half months, or one month in advance.

Gansu

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 26th: Gansu Province had pre-fulfilled this year's total industrial output value plan by 2.09% by December 10th, twenty-one days in advance. Fourteen major products have also overfulfilled the production plan prescribed by the state.

　　The hundreds of thousands of workers on the industrial front in Gansu Province have continued to hold high the red flag of the Party's general line for socialist construction this year, and have launched a production upsurge centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. Especially after implementing the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Eleventh Plenary Enlarged Meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, the industrial production upsurge has become increasingly high, and the production level has risen every ten days and every month. The total industrial output value completed in August increased by 12.19% compared to July, 90.33% in September compared to August, 17.24% in October compared to September, and 24.38% in November compared to October. Workers across the province have also put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals and innovative technologies, making production efficiency multiply. For example, the workers of Lanzhou Chemical Plant carried out a technical innovation movement, which increased the daily output of synthetic ammonia by more than double the original design capacity, realizing the struggle goal of "one factory becoming two factories."

　　The industrial front in Gansu Province this year has shown a new atmosphere of competition forming a network, pacesetters forming a line, red flags forming a forest, experience forming a set, and mutual assistance becoming a trend. For example, in the county-run factories and mines in Dingxi, Tianshui, and Pingliang prefectures, more than 47% were rated as red flag units; in Lanzhou, Tianshui, Pingliang, Linxia, and Yumen, the workers rated as red flag hands accounted for 20% of the total number of workers.

Fujian

　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 26th: Fujian Province had exceeded by 3.46% and pre-fulfilled this year's total industrial output value plan by December 20th. Fifty-five major products, including pig iron, timber, iron ore, and sugar machines, have pre-fulfilled and overfulfilled the annual plan, and the output has increased a lot compared to the same period last year. The province has also successfully trial-produced a large number of new products, such as 28-cubic-meter small blast furnace equipment and coke ovens.

　　On the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year, Fujian Province has continued to implement a complete set of two-legged walking policies this year, actively tapping the potential of existing enterprises, and doing a good job in the production of newly built backbone enterprises; on the other hand, giving full play to the role of county and commune-run small and medium-sized enterprises, vigorously grasping the production and construction of various "small foreign groups," thus ensuring the continued leap forward of industrial production this year.

　　After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers in Fujian Province warmly launched a socialist labor emulation of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward." Entering the fourth quarter, thousands of workers have successively entered 1960 ahead of schedule, providing good conditions for the province to overfulfill the annual plan of total industrial output value.

Guizhou

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, December 26th: Guizhou Province had exceeded by 14.3% and pre-fulfilled this year's total industrial output value plan by December 20th. Major products such as steel, coal, coke, pig iron, and power generation have also pre-fulfilled the annual production plan. The quality of products has been significantly improved. The quality of twenty-two products in Guiyang City has reached the national advanced standards. Product costs have been greatly reduced. The cost of steel ingots in the third quarter was 14% lower than that in the second quarter.

　　The fundamental reason for the leap forward development of industrial production and construction in Guizhou Province this year is the resolute implementation of the complete set of "two-legged walking" policies put forward by the Party. While building a number of modern industrial and mining enterprises, the province has further developed county and commune-run industries this year, thus achieving great economic results in a relatively short period of time. The province's steel industry has transitioned from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups," forming twelve steel bases with Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant as the backbone. Two years ago, Guizhou was still a province with "no steel and little iron." The steel industry began to develop last year, and this year, as of December 20th, the production of foreign steel has increased by more than three times compared to the whole year last year; foreign iron has increased by one and a half times. The machinery industry has also begun to gradually improve from repair and assembly to being able to manufacture small and medium-sized complete sets of equipment. For example, 80% of the equipment for the 100-cubic-meter blast furnace newly built in the province this year was manufactured by the province's own machinery industry.

Qinghai

　　Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 26th: As of December 15th, Qinghai Province has pre-fulfilled the annual total industrial output value plan by 21.03%. At the same time, the province's output of more than 100 major products such as pig iron, crude copper, raw coal, coke, potash fertilizer, gypsum, and walking plows, as well as major indicators in basic construction, transportation, geological exploration, and postal and telecommunications, have also pre-fulfilled the annual plan; among them, the output of products such as crude copper and potash fertilizer has exceeded the plan by one to two times.

　　The variety of industrial products in Qinghai Province this year has greatly increased compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Many products that could not be manufactured in the past, such as 100-kilowatt motors, 1,000-kilovolt-ampere transformers, sulfuric acid, 48-row seeders, tractor-drawn three-furrow plows, machine-made paper, and plastic products, can now be manufactured by themselves.

　　The great achievements made by Qinghai Province on the industrial front this year are the result of adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously promoting mass movements, vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution, and carrying out large-scale collaboration. Since mid-October alone, workers across the province have put forward more than 1.2 million innovation proposals. These innovation proposals have played a great role in improving production efficiency and accelerating the completion of the annual plan. (Attached picture)

　　八省全年工业产值计划提前完成
　　党的两条腿走路的方针显著地促进了生产的发展
　　劳动竞赛和技术革新运动大大提高了劳动生产率
　　河北
    新华社天津26日电　河北省工业战线职工已经提前在11月27日完成今年工业总产值计划。到12月20日止，全省钢、钢材、生铁、铁矿石、煤炭、动力机械、水泥、棉纱、棉布等五十种主要产品，已经超额完成国家计划，各项产品都比去年有很大增长。主要产品的质量达到和超过了国家规定的要求。原煤的灰分比国家计划降低0.79％，生铁合格率逐月上升，9月份平均达到80％，10月份又上升到81.3％。产品的成本也大大降低。
    河北省工业生产战线在党的统一领导下，不断反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，坚决全面贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线。职工们开展了增产节约竞赛，技术革新、发明创造层出不穷。到11月底止统计，全省职工共提出合理化建议八百多万条，技术革新项目九万一千四百五十三项。增产节约竞赛的开展，使全省工业劳动生产效率平均提高13％。
    河北省今年工业战线上的巨大成绩，再一次表明了党中央提出的“土洋并举”、“大中小企业并举”等一整套两条腿走路方针的正确。在去年大跃进中办起来的地方小型企业，已成为全省工业战线上的一支重要力量。“小土群”炼铁厂、水泥厂经过整顿和技术改造，今年已经过渡到“小洋群”，并且发挥了巨大威力。今年全省生铁就有90％是由小高炉生产出来的。全省炼钢、铸造用铁已经做到自给，改变了历来依靠外省供应生铁的局面。
　　江苏
    新华社南京26日电　江苏省工业战线传出喜讯：今年工业总产值计划提前二十八天完成。到12月20日止，全省已超额10％完成了全年工业总产值计划。有五十三种主要产品的产量提前超额完成了年度计划，并且都比去年有大幅度的增长，钢、生铁、内燃机、化肥、棉纱分别比去年增产10％到50％以上。
    江苏省今年工业生产继续跃进是不断鼓干劲、争上游的结果，党的八届八中全会以后，全省职工开展了轰轰烈烈的增产节约班组赛、对手赛、对口赛、挂钩赛、一条龙赛等。通过竞赛，不少厂矿企业达到了高产、优质、低成本、高效率、低消耗和安全生产。并且涌现出数以万计的先进单位和先进生产者。
    江苏省各级党委今年坚决贯彻了“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针，一方面生产了大量生铁供给本省和支援上海等地；一方面制造了大批农业机械，促进农业生产发展。今年全省实现电力灌溉和机械灌溉的农田，比去年扩大了40％。
　　广东
    新华社广州26日电　广东省提前十七天超额完成了今年的工业产值计划。到20日为止，主要产品中，已有钢材、生铁、耐火材料、木材、水泥、硫酸、塑料、化学农药、棉纱等四十四种完成或超额完成年度产量计划；许多主要产品的产量比大跃进的1958年有了很大的增长，如硫酸比去年全年产量增长96.1％，水泥增长28.6％。产品成本也有显著降低。
    广东省工业战线的职工，今年在党的领导下，进一步贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，深入地开展了增产节约运动以及技术革新和技术革命运动，从而取得了生产上的巨大胜利。特别是从8月份以来，贯彻了党的八届八中全会决议，反右倾、鼓干劲，使生产水平一月高过一月。全省工业产值8月比7月增长22％，9月比8月增长34％，10月比9月增长10.6％，11月比10月增长23％，12月中旬又比上旬增长8.7％。
　　浙江
    新华社杭州26日电　浙江省到12月20日已经超额4％提前完成了今年的工业总产值计划。钢、生铁、硫酸、烧碱、发电量、金属切削机床、电动机、绸缎、棉纱、棉布等八十三种产品，都提前完成了全年计划；各项产品的产量比1958年有很大增长。产品质量、成本、劳动生产率有很大进步。高炉利用系数已提高到一以上，生铁合格率已提高到90％以上，绸缎正品率已提高到99.61％，电厂煤耗比今年初降低6.46％，1至11月县以上企业生产工人的劳动生产率比去年提高14％。
    浙江省今年不仅进一步发挥了原有企业的生产潜力，而且先后新建了不少企业或车间。新建企业的投入生产，使全省工业生产能力显著增长，技术水平大大提高。许多过去没有生产过的产品，今年也都生产出来。如冶金工业炼出了优质钢，机械工业试制出了好几百种新产品，轻工业新产品更加丰富多采，先后投入生产的有一千多种。
    今年浙江省工业战线取得的成就，是在党的领导下坚决贯彻执行党的总路线的胜利，是贯彻执行党的一整套两条腿走路方针的胜利。在今年头几个月中许多企业就已出现了高产、优质、低耗、安全的全面跃进新局面。党的八届八中全会提出反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的伟大号召后，干部和职工的革命干劲更加高涨，生产水平不断上升。以7月份工业总产值为一百，8月份为一百一十八点四，9月份达到一百六十七，10月份又比9月份高，11月比10月更高。许多厂矿都是提前两个月、一个半月、一个月跨进了1960年。
　　甘肃
    新华社兰州26日电　甘肃省到12月10日止，提前二十一天超额2.09％完成了今年的工业总产值计划，还有十四种主要产品超额完成了国家规定的产量计划。
    甘肃省工业战线上的几十万职工，今年继续高举党的社会主义建设总路线的红旗，掀起以技术革新和技术革命为中心的生产高潮。特别是在贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议和省委第十一次全体扩大会议的精神以后，工业生产热潮愈益高涨，生产水平旬旬月月上升。8月份全省完成的工业总产值比7月份增长12.19％，9月比8月增长90.33％，10月又比9月增长17.24％，11月比10月又增长24.38％。全省职工还提出了成千上万件合理化建议，革新技术，使生产效率成倍提高。如兰州化工厂职工开展技术革新运动，使合成氨日产量比原设计能力提高一倍多，实现了“一厂变两厂”的奋斗目标。
    甘肃省工业战线今年呈现出竞赛成网、标兵成列、红旗成林、经验成套、互助成风的新气象。如定西、天水、平凉三个专区的县办厂矿中，有47％以上被评为红旗单位；兰州、天水、平凉、临夏、玉门五个地区，被评为红旗手的职工占职工总数的20％。
　　福建
    新华社福州26日电　福建省到12月20日止，已经超额3.46％完成了今年的工业总产值计划。全省生铁、木材、铁矿石、糖机等五十五种主要产品，提前超额完成了年度计划，产量比去年同期增长很多。全省还试制成功二十八立米小高炉设备、炼焦炉等大批新产品。
    福建省在去年大跃进的基础上，今年继续贯彻了一整套两条腿走路的方针，积极挖掘现有企业的潜力，搞好新建的骨干企业的生产；另一方面，充分发挥县、社办的中小型企业的作用，大抓各种“小洋群”的生产建设，因而保证了今年工业生产的继续跃进。
    党的八届八中全会以后，福建省职工热烈展开“比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进”的社会主义劳动竞赛。进入第四季度，成千上万的工人相继提前跨进1960年，为全省超额完成工业总产值年度计划，提供了良好条件。
　　贵州
    新华社贵阳26日电　贵州省到12月20日止，已经超额14.3％完成了今年的工业总产值计划。钢、煤、焦炭、生铁、发电量等主要产品，也都提前完成了年产量计划。产品的质量有了显著提高，贵阳市有二十二种产品质量达到了国家先进标准。产品成本大大降低，钢锭成本第三季度即比第二季度降低14％。
    贵州省今年工业生产建设飞跃发展，基本原因是坚决贯彻执行了党所提出的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。在建成一批现代化工矿企业的同时，全省今年进一步发展了县和公社办的工业，因而在较短的时间内收到了很大的经济效果。全省钢铁工业已由“小土群”过渡到“小洋群”，形成了以贵阳钢铁厂为骨干的十二个钢铁基地。两年前贵州还是一个“无钢少铁”的省份，去年钢铁工业开始发展，今年到12月20日生产的洋钢又已比去年全年增长三倍多；洋铁增长一倍半。机械工业也开始由修配逐步提高到能够制造中小型的成套设备，如省内今年新建的一百立方米高炉，80％的设备都是本省机械工业自己制造的。
　　青海
    新华社西宁26日电　到12月15日止，青海省已提前超额21.03％完成了全年的工业总产值计划。与此同时，全省的生铁、粗铜、原煤、焦炭、钾肥、石膏、步犁等一百多种主要产品产量，以及基本建设、交通运输、地质勘探和邮电等方面的主要指标，也都提前超额完成了年度计划；其中粗铜、钾肥等产品产量，分别比计划超额一倍到两倍以上。
    青海省今年工业产品品种比大跃进的1958年大大增加。许多过去不能制造的产品，如一百瓩电动机、一千千伏安变压器、硫酸、四十八行播种机、机引三铧犁、机制纸和塑料制品等，现在都可以自己制造了。
    今年青海省在工业战线上取得巨大成就，是坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革新、技术革命和开展大协作的结果。仅从10月中旬以来，全省职工就提出革新建议一百二十多万件。这些革新建议，对于提高生产效率、加快完成年度计划，都起了很大作用。（附图片）
