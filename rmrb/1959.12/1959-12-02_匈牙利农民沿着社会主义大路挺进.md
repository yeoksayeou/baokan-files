Hungarian Farmers Advance Triumphantly Along the Socialist Road
By our correspondent Wang Chongjie

The agricultural collectivization movement in Hungary is developing rapidly and healthily. More than 40% of the country's villages and towns have now fully realized collectivization. The land area of ​​cooperatives and state farms accounts for 55% of the country's land, and the cultivated land area accounts for more than 50% of the country's cultivated land. A large number of new cooperatives that sprung up like mushrooms after the rain this spring have been consolidated and have won victories on the production front, demonstrating the superiority of socialist collective management. At present, many individual farmers are clamoring to join the cooperatives, and a new upsurge of collectivization will occur this winter and next spring.

It is particularly gratifying that the agricultural collectivization movement in Hungary has achieved such great victories this year after a tortuous and complicated road. Comrade Kadar, First Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, pointed out in April this year when talking about the rapid development of the collectivization movement in the spring: "This is the most significant event in Hungary in recent years besides the defense and consolidation of the people's power."

Advancing in Struggle

The agricultural collectivization movement in Hungary began in the autumn of 1948. By the end of 1952, there were 5,110 agricultural production cooperatives and cooperative groups in the country, with more than 282,000 peasant households joining the cooperatives, with more than 369,000 members. The total land area of ​​the cooperatives was 2,608,000 holds (each hold is about 8.55 mu), and the cultivated land area accounted for 22.6% of the country's total cultivated land. This period developed rapidly and achieved certain results. However, many places violated the principle of voluntariness when forming cooperatives, causing some adverse effects. The established cooperatives were also not well consolidated, and failed to fully demonstrate the superiority and exemplary role of large-scale collective management.

Right-wing elements who opposed the socialist transformation of agriculture took the opportunity to launch an attack on agricultural collectivization when the Party Central Committee criticized the errors and shortcomings that occurred in the previous stage of the collectivization movement at its June 1953 plenary session. They exaggerated the errors and shortcomings in the movement in an attempt to prevent the development of agricultural collectivization.

Revisionist elements headed by Nagy Imre distorted the correct decisions of the Party Central Committee and brazenly peddled their revisionist wares under the guise of anti-"leftism." They touted the great possibility of expanded reproduction of the small-scale peasant economy in the people's democratic system, spread the fallacy that "rural capitalism has been blocked," and nonsensically claimed that the small-scale peasant economy could also "grow into" socialism in its "own way," denying the necessity of socialist transformation of agriculture and doing everything possible to obstruct the collectivization movement. They also used their positions to support individual farmers instead of cooperatives, encouraged farmers to freely withdraw from cooperatives, and tolerated the crimes of rich peasants in sabotaging collectivization and resisting requisition. All of this caused ideological confusion among cadres and the masses, causing huge losses to the collectivization movement. Many cooperatives were dissolved one after another, and many farmers withdrew from the cooperatives. By the end of 1954, the total number of production cooperatives and cooperative groups in the country had dropped to 4,381, the number of households had dropped to more than 186,000, the number of members had dropped to more than 229,000, the total land area had dropped to 1,880,000 holds, and the cultivated land area had dropped to only 15.6% of the country's total cultivated land.

After the Party eliminated Nagy's mistakes in 1955, the collectivization movement gradually began to develop again. As of June 30, 1956, the number of production cooperatives and cooperative groups had increased to 4,863, the number of members had increased to more than 343,000, and the total land area was nearly 2,480,000 holds, with the cultivated land area accounting for 20.8% of the country's cultivated land. In other words, after more than a year, it had almost returned to the level close to the end of 1952.

During the counterrevolutionary riots in October 1956, counterrevolutionary elements directly or indirectly ruined more than half of the cooperatives by killing cooperative directors and Communist Party members, torturing cooperative members, restoring the reputations of landlords and rich peasants, dividing up the land and property of cooperatives, and spreading bourgeois and revisionist views to carry out inflammatory propaganda. By the end of 1956, only 2,089 production cooperatives and cooperative groups remained, with only more than 97,000 households and nearly 120,000 members remaining in the cooperatives. The total land area of ​​cooperatives had dropped to 1,038,000 holds, and the cultivated land area had dropped to 8.5%.

However, the counterrevolutionary elements also served as good negative teachers for the broad masses of working peasants. During the counterrevolutionary rebellion, the overthrown landlords, rich peasants, warlords and bureaucrats of the Horthy era, and the reactionary Cardinal Mindszenty all clamored to restore their past rule and exploitation and demanded that the peasants hand over the land they had obtained during the land reform. Revisionist elements also exposed their true colors of selling out the interests of the working people. The peasants clearly saw that if the counterrevolutionaries were to win and capitalism was restored, they would once again become slaves of the landlords and capitalists and fall into displacement, hunger and cold, and Hungary would once again become a country of "three million beggars." Therefore, the determined cooperative members bravely defended their cooperatives and the banner of socialism in the countryside with sickles and axes. Nearly half of the cooperatives across the country stood their ground and were tempered in the storm of counterrevolutionary attacks. This fully shows that socialist ideology has taken deep root in the Hungarian countryside.

After the counterrevolutionary rebellion was suppressed, the Party corrected some errors in its past agricultural policies. While helping state farms and cooperatives, the Party and the state also helped individual farmers increase production, greatly strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. Based on the situation at the time, the government also abolished the requisition system, adopted a contract purchase system, reasonably adjusted the purchase prices of agricultural products, and stopped a series of measures such as land adjustment, which effectively stimulated agricultural production.

With the consolidation of the state system, the statement of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government on January 6, 1957 emphasized: The government believes that one of its most important tasks is to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture and do its best to assist in the establishment of cooperatives. The resolution of the Party Central Committee in February charged the Party and state organs with the responsibility of supporting cooperatives. The resolution of the National Congress of the Socialist Workers' Party in June emphasized that cooperatives should be consolidated politically and economically to create favorable conditions for the healthy development of the collectivization movement.

Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the adverse effects caused by the counterrevolution were gradually eliminated, and some dissolved cooperatives also restarted collective management one after another. By the end of 1958, the number of production cooperatives and cooperative groups had increased to 3,507, with a total of 143,000 peasant households joining the cooperatives, with 168,000 people and a land area of ​​1,664,700 holds.

During this period, although the number of cooperatives had not yet recovered to the level before the counterrevolutionary rebellion, the cooperatives that had been established had been consolidated politically, organizationally and economically after more than two years. Whether it was in 1957, when the climate was good and agriculture was abundant, or in 1958, when the grain harvest was affected by drought, the production of cooperatives was much better than that of individual farmers. In the drought-stricken 1958, the superiority of large-scale collective management was especially evident. The average yield of grain per hold in cooperatives was more than 20% higher than that of individual farmers. The prestige of cooperatives among individual farmers has greatly increased.

New Upsurge of Collectivization

In December 1958, the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party formulated a resolution on continuing to carry out the agricultural production collectivization movement. At that time, the domestic political and economic situation was unprecedentedly improved, the Party's prestige was enhanced, and the general election of the National Assembly achieved a brilliant victory. The international situation was also one in which the East wind prevailed over the West wind, and socialist countries were rapidly building socialism.

The resolution of the Party Central Committee pointed out that the pace of socialist transformation of agriculture in Hungary should be accelerated, and all localities should strive to create conditions for establishing cooperatives; in places where conditions are already in place, production cooperatives should be established immediately; and existing production cooperatives should be rapidly and vigorously expanded. The Party Central Committee called on the entire Party and people, Party organizations at all levels, the National Assembly, and mass organizations to actively participate in the publicity and organization work of cooperatives.

However, at that time, there were different views within the Party on the issue of collectivization, mainly with two different erroneous views. Some people believed that implementing the collectivization policy would threaten the worker-peasant alliance that was being strengthened and lead to reduced production. They only saw the middle peasants who wanted to maintain the status quo and ignored the danger of rural capitalism. This was a right-leaning compromise attitude that emerged under the rampant attacks of the enemy and the influence of revisionist views. Others believed that agricultural socialist transformation could only be completed by greatly reducing the income of peasants and "impoverishing" wealthy peasants. They failed to see the growth of the Party's strength and influence, underestimated the consciousness of the peasant masses, and ignored the improvement of agricultural production and peasant sentiments. This was an attitude of lack of trust in the peasant masses.

The Party Central Committee severely criticized various erroneous views, overcame ideological obstacles to the development of the Party's collectivization movement, unified the ideological understanding of cadres, achieved unity of will and action, and ensured the correct implementation of the central resolution.

Since the beginning of this year, an unprecedented upsurge of the collectivization movement has emerged in the countryside. This movement has many characteristics: First, the speed is fast and the scale is large. The number of peasant households and land joining the cooperatives has quadrupled in three months. As of March 31, the number of cooperatives had increased to 4,490 (including 470 cooperative groups), with a total of 449,312 households, 523,295 people, and a land area of ​​3,710,800 holds.

Second, middle peasants and wealthy middle peasants joined the cooperatives in large numbers. Middle peasants accounted for only 15% of the original members, and small and middle peasants with 5 to 25 holds of land accounted for 70% of the new members, half of whom were middle and wealthy middle peasants with 8 to 25 holds of land.

Third, collectivization of entire villages and entire townships. About 1,400 villages and towns have fully realized collectivization. Moreover, most of them are one cooperative per village, and the average scale of the cooperatives is more than twice as large as in the past. This not only eliminates the trouble of adjusting land, but also facilitates public construction and the utilization of the advantages of large-scale management.

Fourth, the development of various regions is uneven. The three states of Győr-Sopron, Szolnok and Veszprém have basically realized collectivization, and eight of the other sixteen states are also developing faster, while the other eight are slower. The regions with rapid development are mainly due to sufficient preparatory work, good publicity and education, political and ideological work, and the earnest implementation of the Party's policies in a flexible manner based on local characteristics.

The reason why the collectivization movement in the spring was able to achieve rapid progress, as Comrade Kadar pointed out, is mainly due to the correct policies of the Party and the government, the increased political consciousness of the working masses, and their support for the Party's policies. The Party swept away the ideological obstacles affecting the development of the movement, mobilized the masses, mobilized the entire Party and people, and carried out extensive political propaganda work, creating a huge social momentum; and fully exerted the enthusiasm and creativity of local Party committees, and timely summarized and promoted experience. The early established cooperatives also played an exemplary role for individual farmers. The government's strong economic support for cooperatives and other measures also promoted the development of the collectivization movement.

Vigorously Consolidate New Cooperatives

After a large number of new cooperatives were established, the Party Central Committee decided at its March plenary session to temporarily stop the work of developing cooperatives, promptly shift to spring plowing and production, and vigorously rectify and consolidate the newly formed cooperatives. The Party pointed out that consolidating cooperatives should be regarded as the work of the entire society.

Establishing Party organizations in cooperatives is the most important political condition for consolidating cooperatives. With the development of the collectivization movement, the political enthusiasm of the peasants has also increased day by day. The Party has absorbed a large number of activists who have emerged in the agricultural collectivization movement into the Party and actively established and developed Party organizations in cooperatives. Now most cooperatives have Party grassroots organizations, expanding the Party's influence in the countryside.

The central and local governments have also transferred 1,900 political workers and 3,000 technical personnel such as accountants and agronomists to work in cooperatives for a long or short period of time. Among them, 600 political cadres and 900 agricultural technicians have been dispatched by the central government to work in the countryside for a long time. This has greatly strengthened the leadership work of cooperatives.

Leading cadres at the central and local levels also often go to the countryside to understand the situation and guide the work. All Party and government organs, social organizations, factories and enterprises, state farms, agricultural research institutes and other units are responsible for assisting a new cooperative and helping the new cooperative solve various difficult problems. Almost every new cooperative in the country receives fixed assistance from a factory or enterprise. This brings cooperative farmers closer to the working class, increases the working class's sense of responsibility for the collectivization movement, strengthens the worker-peasant alliance, and promotes the consolidation of cooperatives.

The state also provides huge economic support to cooperatives. The government has increased investment in agriculture. This year, in addition to allocating 1.2 billion forints (Hungarian currency) in long-term loans, public livestock sheds will be built for the 110,000 heads of livestock of the new cooperative members. According to statistics, this year's investment in the construction of agricultural production cooperatives is more than the total investment from 1950 to 1958. The state has also issued 1.3 billion forints in medium- and short-term loans for cooperatives to purchase seeds, fertilizers, and pay for the depreciation of livestock and farm tools of new members. In order to meet the needs of large-scale management for the use of machinery, in addition to increasing the domestic production of agricultural machinery, the state has also purchased 5,000 tractors, 3,400 seeders, and 500 combines from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia, providing agriculture with twice as much fertilizer as last year. All employees in the national agricultural machinery manufacturing, chemical industry and construction departments have universally launched a labor competition to increase production and save money and support agriculture. These huge financial and economic supports have helped new cooperatives quickly lay the foundation for large-scale management.

The working peasants who have embarked on the road of collective management, with the enthusiastic support of the entire Party and people, have worked together with one heart and high morale to invest in spring plowing and sowing work. This year's spring plowing and sowing work has been completed better than in previous years.

According to the bulletin of the third quarter of the Hungarian Central Bureau of Statistics, this year's bread grain and feed grain production increased by 30% compared with last year, while the average yield of wheat per hold in old cooperatives was about 25% higher than that of individual farmers, and the newly established cooperatives were also about 15% higher than that of individual farmers.

Győr-Sopron State, which has fully realized collectivization, used to have a more developed animal husbandry industry, and the yield per unit area of ​​crops was lower than the general level in the country. However, this year's average yield of wheat per hold is 80 kilograms higher than the national average, and rye is 130 kilograms higher. The sown area of ​​feed corn in this state has increased nine times compared with last year, and the vegetable planting area has increased two times. The proportion of agricultural product commodities provided by this state this year is also larger than in previous years and in states that have not yet been collectivized.

Facts have proved that the tasks of developing cooperatives and increasing production put forward by the Party can be completed at the same time. And only socialist agriculture with large-scale collective management can ensure the continuous and rapid improvement of agricultural production.

With the development of collectivization, the face of the countryside is also changing. The peasants in collectivized villages are using collective strength to build houses, cultural palaces, clinics, nurseries, and kindergartens. Many cooperatives have also formulated long-term plans for rural construction.

Accelerate the Pace of Progress

Although the agricultural collectivization movement in Hungary has gone through a tortuous road, the Socialist Workers' Party has accepted past experiences and lessons, corrected the errors and shortcomings that occurred in the past collectivization movement, carried out a resolute struggle against revisionist views, and implemented correct policies, finally leading the agricultural collectivization movement to a path of healthy development. The new upsurge of the agricultural collectivization movement this spring has not only taken a big step forward in the cause of agricultural collectivization, but also greatly promoted the development of industry, affected all strata of society, strengthened the worker-peasant alliance, and further consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is another heavy blow to domestic and foreign counterrevolutionaries!

The Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party emphasized in the instructions on the Seventh National Congress published at the end of September: It is necessary to create all necessary conditions, persuade individual farmers, and cooperate with them to end the socialist transformation of agriculture in the next few years; and at the same time as the socialist transformation of agriculture, rely on the large-scale socialist agricultural production to overcome the relative backwardness of agriculture, so that the average output of agriculture from 1961 to 1965 will increase by 30% to 32% compared with the average output from 1954 to 1958.

At present, the Party still attaches great importance to the consolidation of new cooperatives. Comrade Kadar pointed out: "Consolidation work is an indispensable condition for the further development of the entire collectivization movement."

The Party is further strengthening and developing Party organizations in rural areas, improving the leadership level of cadres, especially strengthening the political and ideological work of the masses and raising the socialist awareness of peasants. After individual farmers join the cooperatives, although there have been changes in ownership and production methods, it is difficult to change correspondingly the private views and habits that have been built on the basis of the small-scale peasant economy for a long time. Various contradictions often arise between the small-peasant ideology and the collective ownership system. The Party pointed out that it is necessary to carry out in-depth publicity and education work to help peasants establish collectivist views in order to better promote production.

The Socialist Workers' Party also discussed in detail the development of the collectivization movement in the coming year at the Central Plenary Session held on October 22 this year. The resolution of the Central Plenary Session pointed out that as long as the conditions are ripe, we must continue to bravely and vigorously organize cooperatives this winter and next spring. The so-called conditions mainly depend on how well the publicity and organization work in various places is done and whether the peasants are willing to join the cooperatives.

In the development of collectivization, the Party criticized the "theory of economic conditions only" - that is, the development of collectivization depends on how much loans the state can provide and how many machines it can supply, and does not see the collective strength of the peasants themselves after collectivization.

The Party also criticized the impetuous mood of not considering objective conditions in the development of collectivization, only starting from subjective wishes, and attempting to accomplish it all at once.

At present, many places are actively preparing for the establishment of cooperatives in winter. Under the correct leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, more farmers will embark on the road of collective management this winter and next spring.

Since the great development of the collectivization movement in Hungary this spring, the reactionary newspapers and radio stations in the West have all chorused that "Hungarian peasants are forced to join the cooperatives," "joining the cooperatives is equal to becoming hired laborers," and "cooperatives have plunged Hungarian peasants into hunger and cold" and other shameless lies. Yugoslav revisionists have also launched a large-scale attack on the socialist transformation of agriculture in Hungary.

Hungarian government spokesman Jaros pointed out at a press conference held in Budapest on April 10: The slander of Hungarian collectivization by the Yugoslav "International Affairs Review" is in the same tone as the slander of Hungarian peasants by the "Radio Free Europe." They insist that Hungarian peasants have embarked on the road of socialist collectivization under the influence of violence. The Yugoslav revisionists also maliciously publicized that the current "form of merger is not suitable for Hungarian peasants." But no matter how hard the imperialists and revisionists work to curse and slander, the Hungarian peasants are firmly advancing along the broad road of socialism!

    匈牙利农民沿着社会主义大路挺进
    本报记者　王崇杰
    匈牙利农业合作化运动正在迅速而健康地向前发展着。现在全国已有40％以上的村镇完全实现了合作化，合作社和国营农场的土地面积已占全国土地的55％，耕地面积已占全国耕地的50％多。今年春季雨后春笋般出现的大批新社已得到巩固，并在生产战线上打了胜仗，显示了社会主义集体经营的优越性。目前很多个体农民正在纷纷要求入社，今冬明春将出现合作化的新高潮。
    农业合作化运动在匈牙利经过一段曲折复杂的道路后，今年能够获得这样巨大的胜利是特别令人喜悦的。社会主义工人党第一书记卡达尔同志今年4月在谈到春季合作化运动的迅速发展时曾指出：“这是匈牙利国内几年来除了人民政权的得到保卫和巩固外，最具有重大意义的事件。”
    在斗争中前进
    匈牙利农业合作化运动是1948年秋开始的。到1952年底，全国已有五千一百一十个农业生产合作社和合作组，有二十八万二千多农户入了社，社员达三十六万九千多人，合作社的土地总面积共计有二百六十万八千霍尔特（每霍尔特约合八点五五市亩），耕地面积已占全国耕地总面积的22.6％，这个时期发展较快，取得了一定的成绩。但不少地方在组社时违反了自愿原则，造成一些不良影响。建立起来的合作社也没有很好地巩固，未能充分显示大规模集体经营的优越性和示范作用。
    反对农业社会主义改造的右派分子，当1953年6月党中央全会批判前一阶段合作化运动中出现的错误和缺点时，乘机向农业合作化发动了进攻。他们夸大运动中的错误和缺点，企图阻止农业合作化的发展。
    以纳吉·伊姆雷为首的修正主义分子歪曲了党中央全会的正确决定，在反“左”倾的幌子下，狂妄地贩卖其修正主义的私货。他们鼓吹小农经济在人民民主制度中扩大再生产的巨大可能性，散布“农村资本主义已被堵塞”的论调，胡说什么小农经济也能以其“自己的方式”“长入”社会主义，否认农业社会主义改造的必要性，百般阻挠合作化运动。他们并利用职权，支持个体农民而不支持合作社，鼓励农民自由退社，容忍富农破坏合作化和抗拒征购等罪恶活动。这一切都造成干部和群众思想上的混乱，使合作化运动蒙受巨大的损失。很多社先后解散，不少农民退了社。到1954年底，全国的生产合作社和合作组的总数下降到四千三百八十一个，户数下降到十八万六千多，社员下降到二十二万九千多人，土地总面积下降到一百八十八万霍尔特，耕地面积下降到只占全国耕地总面积的15.6％。
    1955年党清除了纳吉的错误之后，合作化运动又开始逐渐向前发展。到1956年6月30日，生产合作社和合作组增长到四千八百六十三个，社员增加到三十四万三千多人，土地总面积将近二百四十八万霍尔特，耕地面积占全国耕地的20.8％。也就是说，经过一年多的时间，差不多又恢复到接近1952年底的水平。
    1956年10月反革命暴乱时，反革命分子利用杀害社主任和共产党员，拷打社员，恢复地主富农的名誉，瓜分合作社的土地和财产，散布资产阶级和修正主义观点，进行煽动性的宣传，直接间接搞垮了二分之一以上的合作社。到1956年底，生产合作社和合作组只剩下二千零八十九个，留在合作社的只有九万七千多户和近十二万个社员，合作社的土地总面积下降到一百零三万八千霍尔特，耕地面积降低到8.5％。
    但是，反革命分子也给广大劳动农民当了很好的反面教员。在反革命叛乱过程中，被推翻了的地主富农、霍尔蒂时代的军阀官僚、反动红衣主教明曾蒂都猖狂地要恢复他们过去的统治剥削，要农民交出他们土地改革时得到的土地。修正主义分子也暴露了他们出卖劳动人民利益的原形。农民们清楚地看到，假若让反革命获胜和资本主义复辟，他们将重新变成地主资本家的奴仆，陷入流离失所、饥寒交迫的境地，匈牙利将重新成为“三百万乞丐”的国家。所以坚定的社员们拿起镰刀和斧头勇敢地保卫了他们的合作社，保卫了农村中社会主义的旗帜。全国差不多有将近一半的合作社在反革命进攻的风暴中站住了脚，并经受了锻炼。这充分说明社会主义思想在匈牙利农村中已经深深地扎下了根。
    反革命暴乱被镇压后，党改正了过去农业政策中的一些错误，党和国家在帮助国营农场和合作社的同时，也帮助个体农民提高了生产，大大加强了工农联盟。根据当时的情况，政府并取消了征购制，采取合同收购制，合理地调整了农产品的收购价格，停止了土地调整等一系列措施，有效地刺激了农业生产。
    随着国家制度的巩固，1957年1月6日工农革命政府的声明中就强调指出：政府认为它最主要的任务之一是进行农业社会主义改造，尽量协助建立合作社。2月的党中央全会的决议责成党和国家机关把支持合作社视为自己的职责。6月社会主义工人党全国代表会议的决议又强调指出，要在政治上和经营上巩固合作社，为合作化运动的健康发展创造有利的条件。
    由于党的正确领导，逐渐消除了反革命所造成的恶劣影响，一些解散了的合作社也先后重新开始了集体经营。到1958年底，生产合作社和合作组增加到三千五百零七个，入社农户共有十四万三千户，十六万八千多人，土地面积达一百六十六万四千七百霍尔特。
    这期间合作社虽然在数量上还没有恢复到反革命叛乱以前的水平，可是经过两年多的时间，已经成立的合作社在政治上、组织上和经济上都得到了巩固。不论在气候好、农业丰收的1957年，还是因天旱谷物收成受到一定影响的1958年，合作社的生产都比个体农民好得多。在天旱的1958年，尤其显示了大规模集体经营的优越性，合作社谷物每霍尔特的平均产量要比个体农民高20％以上。合作社在个体农民中的威信大大提高了。
    合作化新高潮
    1958年12月，社会主义工人党中央全会制定了关于继续开展农业生产合作化运动的决议。当时，国内的政治经济情况空前好转，党的威信提高，国会大选获得辉煌的胜利。国际局势也正是东风压倒西风，社会主义国家都在快速地建设着社会主义。
    党中央委员会的决议指出，匈牙利的农业社会主义改造的速度应该加快，各地应当努力创造建社的条件；在条件已具备的地方，应立即成立生产合作社；对已有的生产合作社，要迅速大力加以扩展。党中央号召全党全民、各级党组织、议会和群众团体都积极参与合作社的宣传组织工作。
    可是当时党内在合作化问题上看法不一，主要存在着两种不同的错误观点。一些人认为贯彻合作化政策会威胁正在加强着的工农联盟，导致减产。他们只看到希望保持现状的中农，无视农村资本主义的危险。这是在敌人猖狂进攻和修正主义观点影响下出现的右倾妥协态度。另一些人认为，只有大大减低农民的收入，使富裕农民“贫困化”，才能完成农业社会主义改造。他们看不到党的力量和影响的增长，低估了农民群众的觉悟，忽视农业生产和农民情绪的好转。这是一种对农民群众缺乏信任的态度。
    党中央严肃地批判了各种错误观点，克服了党关于合作化运动发展的思想障碍，统一了干部的思想认识，取得了意志和行动的一致，保证了中央决议的正确贯彻。
    今年开春以来，农村便出现了合作化运动的空前高潮。这次运动具有许多特点：首先是速快度，规模大。三个月内入社的农户和土地都翻了两番。到3月31日为止，合作社增加到四千四百九十个（其中包括四百七十个合作组），入社的共有四十四万九千三百一十二户，五十二万三千二百九十五人，土地面积达到三百七十一万零八百霍尔特。
    其次是中农、富裕中农成批入社。原有社员中中农仅占15％，新社员中有地五到二十五霍尔特的小、中农占70％，其中一半是八到二十五霍尔特的中农和富裕中农。
    第三是整村、整乡的合作化。约一千四百个村镇完全实现了合作化。而且大部分是一村一社，社的规模也平均比过去扩大了一倍多。这样既免除了调整土地的麻烦，又有利于进行公共建设和利用大规模经营的优越性。
    第四是各地区的发展不平衡。吉厄尔—索普伦、索尔诺克和维斯普雷姆三个州已基本上实现了合作化，其他十六个州有八个速度也较快，其他八个则较慢。发展快的地区主要是由于事前准备工作充分，宣传教育和政治思想工作做得好，根据地方特点采取灵活方式认真贯彻了党的政策。
    春季合作化运动所以能够获得迅速的进展，正像卡达尔同志所指出的，主要是由于党和政府的政策正确，劳动群众政治觉悟的提高以及对党的政策的支持。党扫除了影响运动发展的思想障碍，发动了群众，全党全民动员，大家动手，开展了广泛的政治宣传工作，造成巨大的社会声势；并充分发挥了地方党委的积极性和创造性，及时总结和推广了经验。早期成立的合作社也对个体农民起了示范作用。政府在经济上给予合作社以大力支持等等措施，也促进了合作化运动的发展。
    大力巩固新社
    在大批新社成立后，党中央三月全会决定把发展合作社的工作暂时停下来，及时转入春耕生产，并大力整顿和巩固新组成的合作社。党指出，要把巩固合作社看做是整个社会的工作。
    在合作社里建立党组织是巩固合作社最重要的政治条件。随着合作化运动的发展，农民的政治热情也日益高涨，党吸收了大批在农业合作化运动中出现的积极分子入党，积极建立和发展合作社的党组织。现在大部分合作社都有了党的基层组织，扩大了党在农村的影响。
    中央和各地并抽调了一千九百名政治工作者和三千名会计和农艺师等技术人员，长期或短期到合作社工作。其中由中央派遣到农村长期工作的政治干部有六百名，农业技术人员有九百名。这大大加强了合作社的领导工作。
    中央和地方的领导干部也经常下乡了解情况，指导工作。所有的党政机关、社会团体、工厂企业、国营农场和农业研究所等单位，都分别承担协助一个新社，帮助新社解决各种困难问题。全国几乎每一个新社都得到一个工厂企业的固定帮助，这使合作社农民更靠近工人阶级，也增加了工人阶级对合作化运动的责任感，加强了工农联盟，促进了合作社的巩固。
    国家也在经济方面给予合作社以巨大的支持。政府增加了对农业的投资。今年除拨出十二亿福林（匈币）的长期贷款，为新入社的十一万头牲畜修建公共畜舍。据统计，今年用于农业生产合作社建筑方面的投资比1950年到1958年投资的总额还多。国家还发放了十三亿福林的中期和短期贷款，供合作社购买种籽、肥料和支付新社员入社牲畜和农具的折价。国家为了满足大规模经营对机器使用的需要，除增加国内农业机器的生产外，还从苏联、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克增购了五千台拖拉机、三千四百台播种机和五百台康拜因，向农业提供了两倍于去年的化肥。全国农业机器制造业、化学工业和建筑部门的全体职工普遍展开了增产节约、支持农业的劳动竞赛。这些财政经济方面的巨大支持，帮助新社迅速奠定了大规模经营的基础。
    走上集体经营大道的劳动农民，在全党全民的热烈支持下，同心合力，斗志昂扬地投入了春耕春播工作。今年春耕春播工作比往年完成得都好。
    据匈牙利中央统计局第三季度的公报指出，今年面包谷物和饲料谷物比去年增产了30％，而老合作社麦子每霍尔特的平均产量比个体农民约高25％，新成立的合作社也比个体农民约高15％。
    已全部实现了合作化的吉厄尔—索普伦州，过去是畜牧业较发达，农作物的单位面积产量低于全国的一般水平。但今年小麦每霍尔特的平均产量比全国的平均产量高八十公斤、裸麦高一百三十公斤。这个州饲料玉米的播种面积比去年提高九倍，蔬菜种植面积增加了两倍。今年这个州提供的农产品商品的比例也比往年和现在尚未合作化的州大。
    事实证明党所提出的发展合作社和提高产量的任务是可以同时完成的。而且也只有大规模集体经营的社会主义农业，才能保证农业生产不断和迅速地提高。
    随着合作化的发展，农村的面貌也在发生着变化，合作化村的农民正在用集体的力量兴建住宅、文化宫、医疗所、托儿所和幼儿园，很多社并制定了乡村建设的远景规划。
    加速前进步伐
    农业合作化运动在匈牙利虽然经过了曲折的道路，但由于社会主义工人党接受了过去的经验教训，纠正了过去合作化运动中出现的错误和缺点，同修正主义观点进行了坚决的斗争，执行了正确的政策，终于把农业合作化运动导向健康发展的道路。今春农业合作化运动的新高潮，不仅把农业合作化事业推进了一大步，而且也大大推动了工业的发展，影响到社会的各阶层，加强了工农联盟，进一步巩固了无产阶级专政。这对国内外的反革命又是一次沉重的打击！
    社会主义工人党中央委员会9月底发表的关于第七次代表大会的指示中强调指出：必须创造一切必要的条件，说服个体农民，并与他们共同合作，在今后几年内结束农业的社会主义改造工作；并且在农业社会主义改造的同时，依靠社会主义农业大生产，克服农业的相对落后，使1961—1965年农业的平均产量比1954—1958年的平均产量提高30％到32％。
    目前党仍然非常重视新社的巩固工作。卡达尔同志指出：“巩固工作是整个合作化运动进一步发展不可缺少的条件”。
    党正在进一步加强和发展农村的党组织，提高干部的领导水平，特别是加强群众的政治思想工作，提高农民的社会主义觉悟。个体农民入社后，虽然在所有制和生产方式上起了变化，但长期建筑在小农经济基础上的私有观点和习惯，很难一时得到相应的改变。小农思想意识与集体所有制之间还经常产生各种各样的矛盾。党指出，必须进行深入的宣传教育工作，帮助农民树立集体主义观点，才能更好地推进生产。
    社会主义工人党在今年10月22日举行的中央全会上又详细讨论了今后一年合作化运动的发展问题。中央全会的决议指出，只要条件成熟的地方，今冬明春就要继续勇敢地大力组织合作社。所谓条件主要是要看各地的宣传组织工作做得如何，农民是否愿意入社。
    在合作化的发展上，党批判了“唯经济条件论”——就是说合作化的发展取决于国家能提供多少贷款，供应多少机器，而看不到合作化后农民本身的集体力量。
    党也批判了在发展合作化的问题上不顾客观条件，只从主观愿望出发，企图一气呵成的急躁情绪。
    目前很多地方都在积极进行冬季建社的准备工作，在社会主义工人党的正确领导下，今冬明春将有更多的农民走上集体经营的道路。
    今春匈牙利合作化运动大发展以来，西方的反动报刊和电台都异口同声的叫嚣“匈牙利农民是被强迫入社的”、“入社等于当雇农”、
  “合作社使匈牙利农民陷入饥寒交迫”等无耻的谎言。南斯拉夫修正主义分子也对匈牙利的农业社会主义改造大肆攻击。
    匈牙利政府发言人贾罗什4月10日在布达佩斯举行的记者招待会上指出：南斯拉夫“国际事务评论”对匈牙利合作化的诽谤同“自由欧洲电台”诬蔑匈牙利农民的声调是一致的。他们硬说什么匈牙利农民在暴力的影响下走上社会主义集体化的道路。南斯拉夫的修正主义分子并恶意的宣扬目前匈牙利的“合并形式是不适合于匈牙利农民的”。但是不管帝国主义和修正主义分子怎样煞费苦心地诅咒和诽谤，匈牙利农民却在坚定地沿着社会主义的康庄大道勇往直前！
