The pest and disease elimination work in the thirteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the south has achieved tremendous results. Currently, the five pests (snails, flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows) and four diseases (schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, filariasis, and malaria) are in the process of being reduced and eliminated. The desolate scenes of sparsely populated disease-ridden areas before liberation are gone forever, replaced by a prosperous atmosphere of "bumper harvests of grains and longevity of people." To meet the requirements of the continued leap forward in the country's production and construction in the coming year, the work of eliminating pests and diseases should continue to be carried out as a vigorous mass movement, and even greater achievements should be made.

The current excellent situation in the country is very conducive to further carrying out the work of eliminating pests and diseases. Under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, right-leaning ideas in health work such as "pests and diseases cannot be eliminated" and "mass movements cannot be carried out for eliminating pests and diseases" have been criticized and corrected. Everyone is enthusiastically participating in the pest and disease elimination campaign this winter and next spring. Under the leadership of the Party, various localities are relying closely on the people's communes to plan and arrange the work of eliminating pests and diseases, and are providing the necessary material and human resources for this work. Through several years of large-scale pest and disease elimination movements, the broad masses of people have accumulated rich experience. The large-scale water conservancy construction and manure accumulation movement carried out in the vast rural areas this winter and next spring is the best opportunity to carry out the prevention and control work of eliminating snails and eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds. We must make full use of the favorable opportunity to eliminate diseases this winter and next spring, take effective measures, work hard this winter and next spring, and further do a good job in eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating the most harmful diseases.

The experience of eliminating pests and diseases in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the establishment of the people's communes, has proven that in this great battle between people and natural diseases, just like other tasks, we must rely on the power of the broad masses of people, coordinate with production and construction, and carry out vigorous mass movements in order to achieve great victories.

Eliminating diseases must be carried out as a vigorous mass movement because it is the urgent demand of the broad masses of people. In old China, due to the cruel oppression of the reactionary rulers, the working people were trapped in the abyss of "poverty" and "disease" all year round. The poorer people were, the less power they had to resist the invasion of diseases, and the more prevalent the diseases became. Large numbers of people died and lost their ability to work, and it became increasingly impossible to escape poverty. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, in order to build a prosperous and strong socialist country, the working people urgently demanded a high-speed development of production and to strengthen their physique and eliminate various diseases. Under the leadership of the Party, the demands of the people have turned into endless creative power. Eliminating pests and diseases must adhere to carrying out vigorous mass movements. What should we pay attention to in carrying out the mass movement to eliminate pests and diseases?

It is necessary to properly solve the relationship between pest and disease elimination work and production. Starting from production, coordinating with production, and serving production is the firm and unwavering principle of pest and disease elimination work. Eliminating pests and diseases is the urgent demand of the broad masses of people, but if the problem of combining with production and serving production cannot be solved well, it may hinder production, and as a result, it will not be possible to launch a mass movement. The bourgeois idea of hygiene for the sake of hygiene should be prevented. Facts have proved that various localities have created many good methods from the perspective of production to carry out pest and disease elimination work, which has strongly supported production. Taking only the millions of schistosomiasis patients who have been cured, calculating that each schistosomiasis patient loses an average of 40% of their labor capacity, this is equivalent to sending about one million full laborers to the agricultural front. Through snail eradication and patriotic health campaigns, many areas have also combined pest elimination with reclaiming large areas of wasteland, developing fish and sideline production, and repairing farmland water conservancy, thereby increasing the income of the masses. Facts have proven that carrying out pest and disease elimination work in conjunction with production can indeed achieve multiple benefits with one action.

Carrying out the pest and disease elimination movement must combine scientific and technical personnel with the broad masses of people under the leadership of the Party. The experience of recent years has proven that the combination of the power of the masses and the power of science and technology can fully exert the combat role of pest and disease elimination. Scientific and technical personnel are an indispensable force, but they can only exert their power when combined with the mass movement. The broad masses of people have accumulated rich experience in the struggle against diseases over the years, and local methods are common among the people, but since they have not been sorted out and improved, they are still relatively crude; this requires scientific and technical personnel to closely integrate with reality, humbly learn from the masses, and sort out and improve their rich experience to meet the needs of the large-scale pest and disease elimination movement. The Party must strengthen its leadership over scientific and technical personnel, adhere to putting politics in command, implement the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, not only boldly mobilize the masses to launch a vigorous movement, but also gradually improve the scientific and technological level of pest and disease elimination on the basis of popularization.

In the process of fighting against diseases, it is necessary to combine the persistent struggle of shock movements and regular work in light of the laws of disease reproduction and transmission. This is an important method to accelerate the elimination of diseases. Because the reproduction and transmission of diseases are very fast, launching a vigorous shock movement can centrally give the diseases a devastating blow. In-depth and meticulous regular work can pursue the remaining diseases and consolidate and develop the results of the shock movement. Each shock movement and the regular work after the shock should propose new combat goals and formulate new battle plans based on the new situation, so that the movement can deepen step by step and improve step by step. In order to ensure that the shock movement and regular work are carried out to the end, it is necessary to vigorously cultivate and train the backbone of pest and disease elimination among the masses and form a basic team. At ordinary times, they will lead the masses to carry out regular prevention and control work, investigate and grasp the changes in diseases, and prepare for the shock movement. Whether it is a shock or regular work, we should implement the principle of combining fundamental and symptomatic treatments, not only thoroughly cleaning up the breeding places of diseases and eliminating the conditions on which diseases depend for survival, but also massively annihilating various larvae and adults that have grown up, so that they will not harm the people.

Carrying out the pest and disease elimination movement must be carried out step by step. According to the experience of recent years, pest elimination must first eliminate the five pests in residential areas and areas frequently visited by residents. Because pests in areas frequently contacted by people are most harmful to people, concentrating forces to first eliminate pests in these areas can more effectively protect people's health and ensure the development of production and construction and various undertakings. Then, we should try every means to gradually expand the scope of the struggle until the five pests are completely eliminated. According to the development process of the pest and disease elimination movement, there are generally three steps: control, reduction, and complete elimination. These three steps are interrelated. The previous step is the preparation for the next step, and the next step is the consolidation and development of the previous step. Relaxation and stagnation are not allowed in the middle. These three steps are also intertwined. Not only are there differences in the steps between regions, but even within a region, the steps are also different due to different foundations for pest and disease elimination. The purpose of doing this is to grasp the laws of disease activity and extensively mobilize the masses to carry out persistent and repeated struggles against diseases.

Recently, the thirteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the south have launched a new upsurge in the mass movement to eliminate diseases in a month. Thousands of masses have thrown themselves into battle with doubled spirits. "Don't let mosquitoes and flies overwinter, don't let snails survive" has become a common demand of the masses. Our current task is to further mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, learn from advanced regions and advanced units, and strive to ensure that each province has an advanced county for pest and disease elimination, each county has an advanced commune, each commune has an advanced production team, each industry has an advanced unit, and each level has advanced people. Use the methods of organizing visits and comparisons, holding on-site meetings, and advanced representative meetings to promote the continuous advancement of the movement.

In order to achieve the tasks for the coming year and strive for greater victories in pest and disease elimination work, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, implement putting politics in command, and resolutely implement the general line. This is the fundamental issue for doing a good job in pest and disease elimination work, and it is also the fundamental issue for whether the mass movement for pest and disease elimination can be launched. At present, it is still necessary to prevent the growth of complacency, slackness, and fear of hardship among prevention and control cadres, and further carry out education against right-leaning tendencies and to boost morale. Make the broad masses of cadres and the masses clearly realize that the current winter pest and disease elimination movement is of great significance to the victory of the overall pest and disease elimination movement next year. We must have a commanding and unstoppable communist style, make ambitious aspirations, and be determined to win this battle.

### 除害灭病必须大搞群众运动

　　除害灭病必须大搞群众运动
    南方十三个省、市、自治区的除害灭病工作，已经取得了巨大成绩。现在，五害（钉螺、苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀）四病（血吸虫病、钩虫病、丝虫病、疟疾）已在缩小和消灭过程中。解放前病害流行地区人烟寥落的凄凉情景已经一去不返，代之以“五谷丰登、人寿年丰”的繁荣气象。为了适应明年祖国生产建设事业继续跃进的要求，除害灭病工作还应该继续大搞群众运动，做出更大的成绩。
    当前全国的大好形势，对进一步开展除害灭病工作是十分有利的。在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召下，卫生工作中的“病害除不完”“除害灭病不能搞群众运动”等右倾思想，已受到批判，并得到了纠正。大家干劲十足地投入今冬明春的除害灭病运动。各地在党的领导下紧紧依靠人民公社，来计划和安排除害灭病工作，并为这一工作提供必要的物力和人力。广大群众经过几年来大规模的除害灭病运动，已经积累了丰富经验。今冬明春广大农村开展的大规模兴修水利和积肥运动，正是大搞灭螺和消灭蚊蝇孳生地等防治工作的最好时机。我们必须充分利用今冬明春消灭病害的有利时机，采取有效措施，大干一冬一春，进一步做好除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害最严重的疾病的工作。
    几年来，特别是1958年大跃进和人民公社建立以来除害灭病的经验证明，在人们与自然界病害的这场伟大战斗中，也像其他各种工作一样，必须依靠广大群众的力量，配合生产建设，大搞群众运动，才能取得巨大的胜利。
    消灭病害之所以必须大搞群众运动，是出乎广大群众的迫切要求。在旧中国，由于反动统治者的残酷压迫，劳动人民终年陷于“贫”与“病”的深渊。人们越是贫困，就越没有力量抵抗病害的侵袭，病害就越流行，人们大量死亡和丧失劳动能力，也就越来越无法摆脱贫困。解放后，劳动人民在共产党领导下，为了建设一个富强的社会主义国家，迫切地要求高速度发展生产，要求增强体质，灭除各种病害。人民群众的这种要求，在党的领导下，变成了无穷无尽的创造力量。除害灭病工作必须坚持大搞群众运动，在开展除害灭病的群众运动中要注意些什么呢？
    要妥善解决除害灭病工作和生产的关系问题。从生产出发，配合生产，为生产服务，这是除害灭病工作的坚定不移的方针。除害灭病是广大群众的迫切要求，但是，如果不能很好解决结合生产，为生产服务的问题，那就有可能会妨碍生产，结果，也就不可能搞起群众运动。为卫生而卫生的资产阶级思想应该加以防止。事实证明，各地从生产出发，进行除害灭病工作，因时因地地创造了许多好的办法，有力地支援了生产。仅以治好的几百万血吸虫病人来说，按每个血吸虫病人平均丧失劳动能力40％计算，就相当于向农业战线输送了整劳动力约一百多万人。通过灭螺和爱国卫生运动，还有不少地区结合除害，开垦了大片荒地，发展了鱼副业生产，整修了农田水利，从而增加了群众的收益。事实证明，结合生产开展除害灭病工作，确实可以收到一举数得的效果。
    开展除害灭病运动必须在党的领导下，科学技术人员和广大群众相结合。几年来的经验证明：群众的力量和科学技术的力量结合在一起，就能充分发挥除害灭病的战斗作用。科学技术人员是一支不能缺少的力量，但是，只有同群众运动结合起来，才能发挥威力。广大群众历年与病害的斗争，已经积累起丰富经验，土方土法遍于民间，但是由于还没有经过整理提高，还是比较粗糙的；这就要求科学技术人员密切结合实际，虚心向群众学习，并把他们的丰富的经验加以整理提高，以适应大规模除害灭病运动的需要。党要加强对科学技术人员的领导，坚持政治挂帅，实行土洋并举的方针，既要放手发动群众，搞起轰轰烈烈的运动，又要在普及的基础上日益提高除害灭病的科学技术水平。
    在与病害作斗争的过程中，要针对病害繁殖与传播的规律，坚持突击运动和经常工作相结合的反复斗争，这是一条加速消灭病害的重要方法。因为病害的繁殖和传播很快，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的突击运动，就可以集中地给病害以歼灭性的打击。而深入细致的经常工作，又可以对残余的病害进行追击，巩固与发展突击运动的成果。每个突击运动和突击后的经常工作，都应该根据新的情况，提出新的斗争目标，订出新的作战计划，使运动步步深入，步步提高。为了使突击运动和经常工作坚持到底，就必须大力培养和训练群众中的除害灭病的骨干，组成基本队伍。平时带领群众开展经常性的防治工作，调查掌握病害的变化情况，为突击运动做好各项准备。不论是突击或经常工作，都应该贯彻治本与治标相结合的原则，既要彻底清理病害的孳生场所，消灭病害赖以生存的条件；又要大量歼灭已经成长的各种幼虫和成虫，不使它危害人民。
    开展除害灭病运动，必须有步骤地进行。根据几年来的经验，除害必须首先消灭居民区和居民常到地区的五害。因为人民经常接触到的地区的害物，对于人们危害最大，集中力量首先扑灭这些地区的害物，就能更有效地保障人民健康，保证生产建设和各项事业的发展。然后，想尽办法，逐步把斗争范围扩大开去，直到把五害彻底消灭。根据除害灭病运动的发展过程，一般有控制、缩小和彻底消灭三个步骤。这三步是互相关联的，前一步是后一步的准备，后一步是前一步的巩固和发展，中间不允许放松和停顿。这三步又是互相交错的，不仅在地区与地区间有前后步骤的不同，即便在一个地区中，也因除害灭病基础不同，步骤也有所不同。这样做的目的，就是要掌握病害活动规律，广泛发动群众向病害坚持不懈地进行反复斗争。
    最近，南方十三个省、市、自治区在一个月的时间内，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的消灭病害的群众运动的新高潮。千千万万的群众，精神百倍地投入战斗，“不让蚊蝇过冬，不让钉螺存身”，成为群众普遍的要求。我们当前的任务是要把群众的积极性进一步地发动起来，向先进地区、先进单位学习，努力做到各省有除害灭病的先进县，各县有先进的公社，每个公社有先进的生产队，行行有先进单位，层层有先进人物。用组织参观评比、召开现场会议和先进代表会议办法，来促进运动不断的前进。
    为了实现今后一年的任务，力争除害灭病工作的更大胜利，必须加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，坚决贯彻总路线，这是做好除害灭病工作的根本问题，也是除害灭病群众运动能不能开展起来的根本问题。就目前来说，仍然必须防止防治干部中的麻痹松劲和怕苦畏难情绪的滋长，进一步进行反右倾、鼓干劲的教育。使广大干部和群众清楚地认识到：目前正在进行的冬季的除害灭病运动，对明年除害灭病运动全局的胜利关系极大，必须具有高屋建瓴、势如破竹的共产主义风格，立下雄心大志，决心把这一仗打好。
