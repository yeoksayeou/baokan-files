Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: Following the successful completion of autumn cultivation and plowing in various regions, a winter cultivation and plowing campaign has rapidly unfolded across the country. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture: Currently, the national autumn and winter plowing area has reached over 940 million mu. In addition to the area cultivated for autumn and winter sowing, nearly 40% of the land for next year's spring sowing has already been plowed, an increase of over 210 million mu compared to the same period last year. The quality of plowing generally meets the required standards.

Currently, in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other regions, plowing has basically concluded due to the freezing of the soil. North China and Gansu, among other regions, have entered a stage of intensive effort, striving to complete all plowing tasks before the freeze. In the Yangtze River basin provinces and regions, a high tide of winter cultivation and plowing is surging forward. The southern provinces and regions, where late-autumn crops mature later and land is cleared later, have also vigorously launched a winter cultivation campaign, which is about to reach a high point.

People's Communes have demonstrated unparalleled power in the winter cultivation and plowing campaign. Various regions have made full use of the advantageous conditions of the People's Communes to launch large-scale mass movements. Many provinces and regions' People's Communes, because of the comprehensive arrangements made for various rural tasks, can spare a large amount of labor for plowing. In the process of plowing, People's Communes also organize large-scale assaults involving workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, thus greatly increasing the number of workers involved. In order to accelerate the progress of plowed land, various regions have widely carried out cooperation based on the principles of overall planning and equal value exchange. Mountain areas support plains, grain-producing areas support cotton-producing areas, those with strong labor and livestock support those with weak labor and livestock, and advanced regions, communes, and teams support backward regions, communes, and teams, thereby greatly accelerating the pace of plowing.

People's Communes' farm tool repair and manufacturing plants in various regions have manufactured a large number of improved farm tools for land plowing, thus ensuring fast and high-quality plowing.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning dispatch: Under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, members of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, after more than a month of arduous struggle, had exceeded the winter planting plan for grain crops, vegetables, rapeseed, and green manure crops by 2.1% by November 20th. Now, People's Communes in various regions are taking advantage of their victory to shift to drought resistance and seedling protection, strengthening field management.

Since late September, Guangxi has had very little rain, and some areas have experienced drought. From mid-October to late November, rainfall gradually occurred in the northern regions, and the drought was relieved; however, the drought situation continued to develop in the central and southern regions, seriously threatening the sowing of winter crops. In order to overcome the drought and complete the winter planting plan, commune members in various regions, under the leadership of Party organizations, continued to persist in drought resistance. Winter crops throughout the region are generally subject to two plowing and two harrowing sessions, soil crushing, watering, and fertilization with more than twenty dan per mu.

While combating drought and planting winter crops, various regions have paid special attention to strengthening drought resistance and seedling protection to prevent planted crops from suffering from drought. After the hard work of members of all ethnic groups, the overwintering crops sown throughout the region have emerged one after another, and the early-planted crops are already lush green.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang dispatch: Jiangxi Province has exceeded this year's winter planting plan, and the winter planting work was successfully completed ten days ahead of last year. The quality is also better than last year, generally achieving one plowing and one harrowing or two plowing and two harrowing, deep plowing to five to seven inches, sufficient base fertilizer application, rational close planting, and timely sowing requirements.

This winter, Jiangxi Province conducted in-depth propaganda and education on socialism and the General Line, speaking extensively about the favorable situation and the superiority of the People's Communes. In response to the right-leaning and slackening thinking of some cadres who advocated a "slow and steady" approach, criticism and debate were carried out, which triggered a large-scale drought resistance and rush planting campaign. In more than twenty counties in Jiujiang, Yichun, and other regions with higher terrain, there had been no thorough rain in one hundred and twenty days from the beginning of July to the end of October. Cadres at all levels led commune members to draw water for rush planting in places with water sources, and carry water for rush planting in places without water sources. If planting was truly impossible, they would cultivate seedlings for transplanting and punch holes for spot planting. As a result, more than 1.5 million mu of winter crops were planted in a timely manner. During the winter planting, various regions also carried out major inspections and competitions to accelerate the pace and improve the quality of sowing.

In early November, the entire province experienced widespread welcome rainfall, and various regions immediately launched a campaign to rush planting while taking advantage of the rain. In order to develop and utilize lake fields and island land and expand the winter planting area, counties around Poyang Lake organized a nearly 100,000-strong land reclamation army to reclaim more than 170,000 mu of lake fields and island land, all planted with rapeseed and other winter crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou dispatch: Guangdong Province has achieved significant results in the fight against drought, and the province has basically completed its winter planting plan. Now, efforts are being made to seize the gaps in time after the end of the autumn harvest to strengthen field management of overwintering crops, resist drought by fertilizing and watering.

From mid-to-late September to mid-November in Guangdong Province, except for a few millimeters of light rain in some areas and less than tens of millimeters of moderate rain in individual counties, most areas had basically no rain; from mid-November to now, there has been no rain in all parts of the province, and the drought has continued for more than seventy days. After overcoming the drought and achieving a bumper harvest of late rice, farmers throughout the province continued to fight drought and rush to plant winter crops. In previous years, areas that generally did not start winter planting until early November started planting in October this year. In the fight against drought and rush planting, all regions implemented simultaneous harvesting, plowing, and winter planting, harvesting in the morning, plowing fields at noon, and winter planting in the evening. Many high and dry fields have also been promptly planted with winter crops after water was drawn and carried for irrigation.

In the rush planting, various regions also implemented simultaneous planting and management to promote early germination and growth of winter crops. In many communes in various counties of the Shaoguan region, dedicated personnel are assigned to manage winter crops, drawing water and carrying water to irrigate seedlings. The winter crops planted in various counties on Hainan Island have generally undergone drought-resistant watering and topdressing, and the seedlings are growing evenly and vigorously.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou dispatch: More than 2.3 million people in the coastal areas of Fujian are launching a concentrated effort to combat drought and rush to plant overwintering crops. According to recent statistics from the Jinjiang, Longxi, Minhou, and Fu'an regions and Xiamen City, more than 3.5 million mu of overwintering crops have been sown. The Minhou and Fu'an regions have completed their wheat planting plans. Jinjiang, Longxi, Xiamen, and other regions are still continuing to combat drought and rush to plant.

Since mid-to-late September, the coastal areas of Fujian have been experiencing prolonged drought without rain, and the affected area has reached more than 1.8 million mu, seriously affecting winter planting work. In order to ensure the completion of the winter planting plan, the People's Communes in drought-stricken areas have given full play to their advantages and mobilized the vast number of commune members to universally launch drought resistance and rush planting. In the Jinjiang region, which is more severely affected by drought, the People's Communes organized more than 600,000 people to engage in drought resistance and rush planting, and all drought resistance tools such as pumps, waterwheels, hand buckets, hanging buckets, and water buckets were put into use.

While combating drought and planting winter crops, the People's Communes also organized field management professional teams to plant one plot, check one plot, and manage one plot, ensuring simultaneous planting and management. Ningde County immediately conducted a comprehensive inspection after sowing. Major teams of the Ningde Huotong Commune organized professional teams to strengthen field management of overwintering crops. According to incomplete statistics from the Minhou and Longxi regions and Jinjiang County, more than 400,000 mu of drought-resistant and rushed-planted crops have been irrigated once to three times, and more than 230,000 mu in Minhou and Longxi have also been fertilized once.

    打好明年农业继续跃进的根基
    全国秋冬翻地九亿多亩
    广西江西广东福建抗旱冬种抗旱保苗
    据新华社29日讯　继各地胜利完成秋耕秋翻以后，冬耕冬翻运动已在全国各地迅速展开。据农业部统计：目前，全国秋冬耕翻面积已达九亿四千多万亩，除了秋、冬播耕翻的以外，明年春播地已耕翻近40％，比去年同期多耕了二亿一千多万亩。耕翻质量一般都达到了要求的标准。
    目前，我国东北、内蒙古、新疆、青海等地因土地封冻，耕翻已基本结束。华北和甘肃等地已进入突击阶段，力争封冻前全部完成耕翻任务。长江流域各省区，冬耕冬翻高潮正在澎湃发展。晚秋作物成熟较晚，腾地较迟的南方各省区，也已大力开展冬耕运动，即将形成高潮。
    人民公社在冬耕冬翻运动中，发挥了无比的威力。各地都充分利用人民公社的有利条件，大搞群众运动。很多省区的人民公社因为全面安排了农村各项工作，可以抽出大批劳力进行耕翻；人民公社在耕翻中还组织工农商学兵大突击，所以大大增加了出工人数。为了加快耕翻地的进度，在全面规划、等价交换的原则下，各地公社广泛地开展了协作。山区支援平原，产粮区支援产棉区，劳畜力强的支援劳畜力弱的，先进的地区、社、队支援落后的地区、社、队，因而使耕翻进度大大加快。
    各地人民公社的农具修配制造厂为耕翻地制造了大量改良农具，从而保证了耕得快、耕得好。
    新华社南宁讯　广西僮族自治区各族社员在各级党组织领导下，经过一个多月的顽强战斗，到11月20日，已超额2.1％完成了粮食作物、蔬菜、油菜、绿肥等冬种计划。现在，各地人民公社正乘胜转入抗旱保苗，加强田间护理工作。
    广西自9月下旬以来，就很少下雨，部分地区出现旱情。10月中旬到11月下旬，北部地区陆续降雨，旱象解除；但中部、南部地区旱情继续发展，严重威胁冬种作物的播种。为战胜干旱，完成冬种计划，各地社员在党组织的领导下，继续坚持抗旱。全区冬种作物，一般做到两犁两耙、碎土、浇水，每亩施肥二十担以上。
    各地在抗旱冬种的同时，特别注意加强抗旱保苗，使种下的作物不受干旱。经过各族社员的奋战，全区播种的越冬作物已陆续破土出苗，早种的已一片葱绿。
    新华社南昌讯　江西省已经超额完成今年冬种计划，冬种工作比去年提前十天胜利结束，质量也比去年好，普遍达到一犁一耙或二犁二耙，深耕五至七寸，施足基肥，合理密植，适时播种的要求。
    今冬，江西省深入地开展了社会主义和总路线的宣传教育，大讲有利形势和人民公社的优越性，并且针对部分干部存在的“慢慢来”的右倾松劲思想，开展了鸣放辩论，从而掀起了规模壮阔的抗旱抢种运动。九江、宜春等专区二十多个地势较高的县，从7月初到10月底，在一百二十天中都没有下过透雨，广大干部带动社员采取了有水源的地方车水抢种，没有水源的挑水抢种，实在种不下去的就育苗移种和打洞点种，结果及时地种下了一百五十多万亩冬季作物。冬种中，各地还开展大检查、大评比，加快了速度，提高了播种质量。
    11月初，全省普降喜雨，各地又立即掀起了趁雨抢种运动。为了开发和利用湖田洲地，扩大冬种面积，沿鄱阳湖四周的县组织了近十万垦荒大军，开垦了十七万多亩湖田洲地，都种上了油菜和其它冬季作物。
    据新华社广州讯　广东省各地抗旱斗争取得重大成果，全省已基本完成了冬种计划。现在正抓紧秋收结束的空隙时间，加强越冬作物的田间管理，抗旱施肥、浇水。
    广东省从9月中、下旬到11月中旬，除部分地区下过几毫米的小雨、个别县下过几十毫米以下的中雨之外，绝大部分地区基本无雨；11月中旬到现在全省各地普遍无雨，干旱已延续了七十多天。全省农民在战胜旱患取得晚稻丰收之后，继续抗旱抢种冬季作物。往年一般都是11月初才动手冬种的地区，今年很多都在10月间就开始下种了。在抗旱抢种中，各地都实行了边收、边犁、边冬种，早上收割，中午犁田，晚上冬种。许多高旱田，经过车水、挑水浇灌，也及时抢种下了冬季作物。
    各地在抢种中，还实行了边种、边管，促使冬种作物尽早发芽生长。韶关专区各县许多公社都固定专人负责管理冬种作物，车水、挑水灌溉幼苗。海南岛各县种下的冬作物，已普遍经过抗旱淋水和追肥，幼苗生长整齐、茁壮。
    新华社福州讯　福建沿海地区二百三十多万人突击抗旱抢种越冬作物。据晋江、龙溪、闽侯、福安专区和厦门市最近统计，已播种越冬作物三百五十多万亩。闽侯、福安两个专区已完成小麦播种计划。晋江、龙溪、厦门等地区，目前仍在继续抗旱抢种。
    福建沿海地区，自9月中、下旬以来，久旱不雨，受旱面积达一百八十多万亩，严重地影响着冬种工作。为了保证完成冬种计划，受旱地区的各人民公社充分发挥优越性，动员广大社员普遍展开抗旱抢种。旱情较重的晋江专区，各人民公社组织了六十多万人，投入抗旱抢种，所有的抽水机、水车、戽桶、吊桶、水桶等抗旱工具都运用起来了。
    在抗旱冬种的同时，各人民公社还组织了田间管理专业队，作到种一丘、查一丘、管一丘，随种随管。宁德县在播种结束后，立即全面检查。宁德霍童公社各大队组织专业队，加强越冬作物田间管理。据闽侯、龙溪地区和晋江县的不完全统计，抗旱抢种的作物已有四十万多亩灌水一次至三次，闽侯和龙溪还有二十三万多亩施了一次肥。
