    Excavation Takes the Lead: Black Gold Will Roll in Next Year
    Fuxin Mines Strengthen Stripping, Excavation and Mechanical Maintenance
    Jixi Prepares Eight Months of Mined Reserves for Next Year
    Shandong Fangzi Coal Mine Obtains Coal Volume for More Than Six Months
    (Our report) After completing this year's national plan ahead of schedule on December 5th, the Fuxin Coal Mine is continuing its efforts to increase coal production. At the same time, it is fully mobilizing the masses to prepare for production in the first quarter of next year, vigorously strengthening stripping, excavation, mechanical equipment and roadway maintenance, material and equipment supply, and other production preparations.
    First, the mines have practically arranged the stripping and excavation of open-pit mines and underground coal mining faces for the first quarter of next year, exposing more mineable coal. Since the beginning of December, the personnel and mechanical equipment for stripping and excavation have been strengthened. The number of electric shovels dedicated to stripping at the Haizhou Open-pit Mine has increased from 20 to 26 or 27; the number of electric shovels dedicated to stripping at the Xinqiu Mine's North Open-pit has increased from two or three to five. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the amount of mineable coal obtained by Fuxin's open-pit mines will increase by 400,000 tons compared to the original plan, with a mineable period of more than two months. In terms of underground excavation, in response to the weak links in the past, such as poor main roadway excavation, many new workers, and low excavation efficiency, the mines are currently adjusting the excavation teams, drawing a large number of skilled workers and good tools to strengthen main roadway excavation; adopting the method of "one master with many apprentices" to accelerate the training of new workers, helping them quickly improve their technical level; at the same time, stabilizing the excavation teams and resolutely preventing the phenomenon of arbitrarily drawing people from the excavation teams to engage in coal mining. In this way, by the end of the year, the amount of mineable coal obtained by the mines throughout the bureau can be increased from the current five and a half months to more than six months, reaching the level stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry.
    Second, in terms of mechanical equipment and roadway maintenance, according to past practices, all projects such as mine hoists and transformer substations that cannot be repaired on weekdays and must be shut down for maintenance are being rushed to be repaired during the New Year and Spring Festival holidays. This year, it was decided to advance the above-mentioned maintenance projects. Now, the maintenance projects, maintenance time, technical measures, and personnel training have all been arranged properly, and many proactive measures have been taken to shorten the maintenance time.
    The leaders of the Fuxin Mining Bureau and the mines attach great importance to this strengthening of production preparation work, are determined, start early, and arrange meticulously. As early as August and November this year, the relevant departments of the Mining Bureau, in conjunction with the mines, formulated plans for the production preparation work of the mine coal mining face succession, major coal exposure projects in open-pit mines, and mechanical maintenance for the first quarter and the whole year of next year, and then repeatedly reviewed and revised them, making preparations as early as possible to ensure that the production preparation work is completed on schedule or ahead of schedule.
    While grasping production preparation work, the employees of Fuxin Coal Mines are also carrying out technical innovations and promoting advanced experience to improve production levels and lay the foundation for continued leaps in production next year. The stripping electric shovel workers of Haizhou Open-pit Mine have recently further promoted the advanced experience of quick loading and ensuring the quality of loading, which has greatly shortened the loading time and the locomotive's one-time operation time. The No. 44 electric shovel created the highest record of loading a row of cars in 14 minutes and 3 seconds; the workers of each open-pit mine have also taken many technical innovation measures to address the current obstacle of frozen car bottoms. Excavation workers have universally promoted ten advanced experiences such as multiple blasting at one time, parallel cross-operation of various types of work, and finished sheds, and excavation efficiency has also been significantly improved.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 22nd. While vigorously grasping current coal production, the Jixi Mining Bureau of Heilongjiang Province is vigorously strengthening preparatory work to welcome a good start next year.
    Preparing enough working faces for the coal mining workers is one of the important guarantees for realizing continued leaps forward next year. Therefore, the Mining Bureau started early to strengthen excavation work in various aspects. First, from the Mining Bureau to each mine entrance, the leadership strength of excavation work has been strengthened; second, each mine has determined specific measures to ensure priority supply of train cars and materials needed for excavation; third, advanced experiences such as deep-hole blasting and multi-machine drilling have been universally promoted in each excavation site to improve excavation efficiency. Up to now, the excavation workers of the entire bureau have prepared enough storage for the coal mining workers to mine for eight months.
    In terms of equipment maintenance, each mine, without affecting current production, is taking advantage of the gap in coal mining preparation to implement a rapid maintenance method of disassembling, repairing, and installing simultaneously in cross-operations, ensuring that the thousands of meters of roadways and hundreds of air doors to be repaired are all repaired before the end of the year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 22nd. After comprehensively completing this year's plan thirty-seven days ahead of schedule, Shandong Fangzi Coal Mine is creating conditions for a good start in production next year.
    The mine has initially put forward a production leap forward plan for next year, mobilizing employees to take the method of debating while acting, and actively strengthening production preparation work for next year. They have adjusted the labor organization, established professional teams, promoted advanced experiences such as four-shift cross-operation and deep-hole blasting, and accelerated the excavation progress, so that the obtained coal volume has reached more than six months. At the same time, they have investigated the situation of all working faces, strengthened roadway maintenance and the preparation of coal mining working faces. At present, the roadway maintenance work has all started, and the succession work of the mining and excavation working faces in the first quarter of next year has been arranged properly. For small coal kilns, they are taking measures that are simple and crude, prioritizing indigenous methods before adopting foreign ones, and strengthening technical transformation. Now, five electric scraper conveyors have been manufactured to equip small coal mines.

    掘进一马当先　来年黑金滚滚
    阜新各矿加强剥离、掘进和机械维修
    鸡西为明年准备好八个月的可采储量
    山东坊子煤矿获得煤量达六个月以上
    本报讯　阜新煤矿在12月5日提前完成今年国家计划以后，一面继续努力增产煤炭，一面充分发动群众为明年第一季度生产，大力加强剥离、掘进、机械设备和巷道维修、材料设备供应等项生产准备工作。
    首先，各矿切实安排了明年第一季度露天矿和井下采煤工作面的剥离和掘进，露出更多的可采煤量。从12月初起，剥离、掘进的人员、机械设备都得到了充实。海州露天矿专搞剥离的电铲由二十台增加到二十六、七台；新丘矿北露天专搞剥离的电铲由两、三台增加到五台，预计阜新各露天矿到今年底的可采获得煤量比原计划将增加四十万吨，可采期达到两个月以上。井下掘进方面，根据过去主要巷道掘进差、新工人多、掘进效率低的薄弱环节，目前各矿正在调整掘进队伍，抽出大批技术熟练的工人和好工具去加强主要巷道掘进；采取“一师多徒”的办法加速培训新工人，帮助他们迅速提高技术水平；同时固定掘进队伍，坚决防止随便从掘进队抽人去搞采煤的现象。这样，到年底，全局各矿井的可采获得煤量，可由目前的五个半月增加到六个月以上，达到中央煤炭工业部规定的水平。
    其次，机械设备和巷道维修方面，按照往年的惯例，凡是平日不能检修必须停止生产检修的矿井绞车提升设备、变电所等项目，都赶到新年和春节假期检修。今年决定把上述检修工程提前进行。现在，检修项目、检修时间、技术措施、人员训练已经全部安排妥善，并且采取了许多积极措施缩短检修时间。
    阜新矿务局和各矿领导上对这次加强生产准备工作极为重视，决心大，动手早，安排细致。早在今年8月和11月间，矿务局有关部门就协同各矿对明年第一季度和全年的矿井采煤工作面接续、露天矿的重大露煤工程施工、机械检修等生产准备工作分别制订了计划，随后又反复进行审核和修订，及早作好准备，保证按计划或提前完成生产准备工作。
    在抓紧生产准备工作中，阜新各煤矿职工还大搞技术革新，推广先进经验，以提高生产水平，为明年生产继续跃进打下基础。海州露天矿剥离电铲工人，最近进一步推广了快装和保证装车质量的先进经验，使装车时间和机车一次作业时间大大缩短，四十四号电铲创造了十四分零三秒装一排车的最高纪录；各露天矿工人还针对当前冻车底的障碍，采取了许多技术革新措施。掘进工人们普遍推广了一次多放炮、各工种平行交叉作业、成品棚子等十项先进经验，掘进效率也有显著提高。
    新华社哈尔滨22日电　黑龙江省鸡西矿务局在狠抓当前煤炭生产的同时，大力加强准备工作迎接明年开门红。
    给回采工人准备好足够的工作面，是实现明年继续跃进的重要保证之一。因此，矿务局早就着手从各方面加强了掘进工作。首先，从矿务局直到各井口，都充实了掘进工作的领导力量；第二，各矿都确定了具体措施，保证优先供应掘进方面需要的车皮和材料等；第三，在各掘进场子普遍推广了深孔爆矿、多机打眼等先进经验，以提高掘进效率。到目前为止，全局掘进工人已经为回采工人准备好了足够八个月开采的储存量。
    在设备维修方面，各矿都在不影响当前生产的情况下，乘采煤准备的空隙，实行拆卸、修理、安装同时交叉作业的快速检修方法，保证在年前把要修理的几千米巷道和几百个风门，全部修理好。
    新华社济南22日电　山东坊子煤矿在提前三十七天全面完成今年计划以后，正为明年生产开门红创造条件。
    这个矿已经初步提出了明年的生产跃进计划，发动职工采取边鸣放辩论、边行动的办法，积极加强明年的生产准备工作。他们调整了劳动组织，建立专业队伍，推广了四班交叉作业、深眼爆破等先进经验，加快了掘进进度，使获得煤量达到六个月以上。同时，调查了所有工作面的情况，加强巷道维修和采煤工作面的准备，目前巷道检修工作已全部开始，明年第一季度采掘工作面的接续工作已经安排妥当。对于小煤窑，正采取因陋就简，先土后洋的办法，加强技术改造；现在已经制出五部电溜子装备小煤井。
