New Well-Drilling Tool
    Rocket Cone
    One Mechanized Well in Five Days
    Greatly Saving Labor
    (Our report) A fast, lightweight, safe to operate, simple in technique, low in labor, and material-saving well-drilling tool has been successfully created in Dongcun People's Commune, Changge County, Henan Province. The Changge County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party named it the "Dongcun Rocket Cone." The Henan Provincial People's Committee commended Dongcun People's Commune in a circular on November 26. To promote this advanced tool, Xuchang Special District and Changge County recently convened an on-site meeting in Dongcun People's Commune.

    Using the "Dongcun Rocket Cone," a mechanized well can be drilled in five days, providing water for a ten-horsepower water pump, greatly shortening the well-drilling time. In the same location, with the same soil structure, and wells of the same depth (eight *zhang*), and quality, the "Liaoning Satellite Cone," once hailed as the most advanced manual well-drilling tool in the country, required 131 labor days, with a maximum of twelve people operating it. In contrast, the "Dongcun Rocket Cone" only requires 60 labor days, with a maximum of nine people operating it.

    This winter and next spring, Changge County needs to drill more than 10,000 mechanized wells and renovate more than 4,600 shallow wells. Calculated using the efficiency of the "Liaoning Satellite Cone," completing the task would require 1,945,000 labor days, accounting for 15% of the total labor days required for water conservancy projects in the county. Using the "Dongcun Rocket Cone" would only require 890,900 labor days, accounting for 6.8% of the total labor days required for water conservancy projects in the county, saving more than one million labor days compared to using the "Liaoning Satellite Cone."

    Changge County requires that "wells and canals be doubly insured" this winter and next spring. In order to improve well-drilling tools and speed up well construction, the county committee conducted a pilot project in Dongcun, sending special personnel and allocating special funds to study technical reforms. Under the slogan "Find raw materials yourself, and study hard if your technology isn't high," with Song Zhonghua, a well-drilling technician and Communist Party member, as the backbone, using waste materials and simple equipment from the county machinery factory, after more than twenty days of exploration and research, they finally successfully created the "Rocket Cone."

    Rocket Cone Operating Method

    One, Erecting the Frame

    First, dig four pits, 5.3 meters diagonally from each other, and plant four large wooden poles into them. Then push them diagonally so the tops converge, and tie them with rope. The soil at the base should be tamped firmly. Bind a crossbeam to the center of the top to install the pulley; bind several horizontal bars to the lower part of the frame to facilitate workers' operation on the frame and to stabilize the frame. Then, install the upper and lower pulleys and the capstan, and attach the steel cable. Finally, in the center of the well frame, dig a well pit and install a protective casing.

    Two, Drilling the Well

    (1) Place the cone in the center of the well casing, and tighten the cone rod with a pipe wrench. Six people push and turn the cone to dig downwards. The soil that is dug up rises with the cone head. When the cone has drilled down about 25 to 30 centimeters, the cone rod spins freely without going down, and feels very light, indicating that the cone cylinder is full of soil and should be lifted to empty the mud.

    (2) After drilling three to four cones, water should be poured into the well until it is ten centimeters deep from the ground, and water should be continuously added to maintain the water depth. If encountering soft mud or quicksand layers, add clay to prevent the mud eye from collapsing.

    (3) Under normal soil conditions, push and turn normally. If encountering quicksand or soft mud, two to three more people should be added to increase the pressure and slowly push and turn. If encountering a soft red clay layer, the mud is taken up very quickly, and pushing and turning can be accelerated. If encountering a gravelly clay layer containing 20% to 30% gravel, the cone head will make cracking sounds, and increased thrust is required to take up mud normally. If encountering a gravelly clay layer containing more than 50% gravel, the cone head will only make sounds without taking up mud or takes up very little mud, the cone should be lifted, an appropriate amount of clay should be filled in, and the gravel should be loosened with the cone tip and stirred before lowering the cone to fill it up.

    (4) According to local hydrological and geological conditions and planning requirements, when drilling to the required depth, replace it with a Yuejin enlargement cone to enlarge the drilling until it is completed. (Attached picture)

    打井新利器
    火箭锥
    五天打一眼机井
    大大节省劳动力
    本报讯　一种打井快速，使用轻便，操作安全，技术简单，用劳力少，省物省料的打井工具，在河南长葛县董村公社创造成功，中共长葛县委给它定名为“董村火箭锥”。河南省人民委员会于11月26日通报表扬了董村人民公社。为推广这一先进工具，许昌专区和长葛县最近在董村公社召开了现场会议。
    使用“董村火箭锥”五天就可以打成一眼机井，供十马力抽水机抽水用，大大缩短了打井时间。在同一地点，土层结构相同，井深均为八丈，质量一样的条件下，用曾被誉为全国最先进的人工打井工具——“辽宁卫星锥”，需一百三十一个劳动日，最多时需十二人操作：而用“董村火箭锥”仅用六十个劳动日，最多时九人操作即可。
    今冬明春长葛县需打机井一万多眼，改造浅井四千六百多眼，以“辽宁卫星锥”工效计算，完成任务需一百九十四万五千个劳动日，占全县水利工程需用劳动日的15％；用“董村火箭锥”只需八十九万零九百个劳动日，占全县水利工程需用劳动日的6.8％，比用“辽宁卫星锥”节省劳动日百余万个。
    长葛县要求在今冬明春实现井渠双保险。为了改进打井工具，加快建井速度，县委在董村搞了试点，派专人拨专款，研究改革技术。在“没有原料自己找，技术不高刻苦钻”的口号下，以打井技工、共产党员宋中华为骨干，利用废料和县机械厂的简单设备，经过二十余天的摸索、钻研，终于创造成功“火箭锥”。
    火箭锥的操作方法
    一、搭架
    先挖四个坑，对角五点三米，将四根大木杆栽入，然后推斜，杆顶合拢，用绳捆绑。底脚土要夯实。在顶部中心绑横梁一根，以备安装滑车；架子下部再绑横杆数根，以便工人在架上操作，并使架子稳固；再绑好上下滑车，安好绞关，上好钢丝绳。最后，在井架中心，挖一井坑，下上护筒。
    二、钻井
    （一）在井筒中心下锥，用牙板、管子钎绞紧锥杆。六个人用力锥砖下挖，挖起的土随锥头上顶。当锥下钻约二十五至三十厘米，锥杆光转不下，同时感觉很轻，即锥筒盛满土，应提锥出泥。
    （二）钻眼三至四锥后，即应往井眼灌水，直到离地面十厘米深时为止，并应不断加水，经常保持水深。如遇软泥流沙等土层时，应加胶泥，防止泥眼坍塌。
    （三）一般土质正常推转，如遇流沙软泥，应上二至三人，加大压力，慢慢推转；如遇软质红胶泥层，吃泥很快，可以加速推转；如遇含有百分之二十至百分之三十的礓石泥层时，锥头圪崩响，需加大推力，才能正常吃泥，如遇含有百分之五十以上礓石泥层时，锥头光响不吃泥或吃的很少应出锥，填入适量胶泥，用锥尖别松礓石绞拌后，再下锥即可吃满。
    （四）根据当地水文地质情况及规划要求，钻至需要深度时，再换跃进扩大锥，进行扩钻，直到完成为止。（附图片）
