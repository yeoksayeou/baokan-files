Overcoming Severe Cold, Accelerating Construction
Harbin's Infrastructure Departments Do a Good Job of Cold Protection and Warmth Preservation

(Our newspaper Harbin, 8th dispatch) Harbin's basic construction departments made proper arrangements for cold protection and insulation work early on, ensuring that more than one million square meters of construction area and more than 300 projects in the city are still under construction in the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius.

This winter, Harbin has a large workload in construction, complex engineering technology, and many high-altitude and open-air operations. As early as August, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed the infrastructure departments to make adequate preparations for cold protection and insulation in winter construction as early as possible. Subsequently, each construction company and construction site established special headquarters and work groups to vigorously secure the reserves of materials related to cold protection and insulation, such as straw, reeds, rice husks, lime, and antifreeze; and organized 12,000 workers in key winter construction trades, as well as temperature measurers and insulation workers, to improve their cold protection and insulation operating skills.

In terms of cold protection and insulation technical measures, each construction engineering company adopted the "three-in-one" method of leading cadres, technicians, and workers, based on the spirit of combining indigenous and foreign methods, using local materials, adapting to local conditions, and spending less money to do more things. They launched a mass movement and created many effective cold protection and insulation methods. Many of these new creations and new technologies for cold protection and insulation have been scientifically evaluated by the construction department in conjunction with scientific research institutions and relevant universities, and continue to be promoted throughout the city. For example, Li Shenghua, a plasterer from the City First Construction Engineering Company and a labor model attending the National Hero Conference, successfully created the "cold slurry brushing" method. By adding calcium chloride and salt to the slurry to reduce the freezing point, the difficulty of wall plastering falling off when frozen in winter construction in the past was solved. Harbin's scientific research department is currently conducting a technical appraisal of this advanced technology.

While taking various cold protection and insulation technical measures, Harbin's infrastructure departments also established weather intelligence networks at all levels to grasp climate changes within a week in advance in order to take various preventive measures. In addition, proper arrangements have been made for the cold protection and insulation of workers engaged in winter construction.

### 战胜严寒　加快施工  哈尔滨基建部门防寒保暖作得好

    战胜严寒　加快施工
    哈尔滨基建部门防寒保暖作得好
    本报哈尔滨8日电　哈尔滨基本建设部门对防寒保温工作及早作了妥善的安排，保证全市建筑面积达一百多万平方米，三百多个工程在零下二十度的严寒里照常施工。
    哈尔滨市今年冬季施工的工程量大，工程技术复杂，高空作业及露天作业也很多。早在8月中，中共哈尔滨市委就指示基建部门及早的充分作好冬季施工中的防寒保温准备。接着各建筑公司和各工地，都成立了专门指挥部和工作组，大抓防寒、保温所需的草苇、稻壳、白灰、防冻剂等有关物资的储备；组织冬季施工中关键工种的工人和测温员、保温员等一万二千人进行训练，提高他们的防寒保温操作技术。
    在防寒保暖技术措施方面，各建筑工程公司采取了领导干部、技术人员、工人“三结合”办法，本着土洋结合，就地取材，因地制宜，少花钱多办事的精神，大搞群众运动，创造了许多有效的防寒保温方法。这些防寒保温的新创造、新技术，很多已由建筑部门会同科学研究机关、有关高等学校及时进行科学鉴定，继续在全市推广。如市第一建筑工程公司抹灰工、出席全国群英会劳动模范李升华创造成功
  “冷刷浆”法，在刷浆掺氯化钙、食盐以降低冰点，解决了过去冬季施工中，抹墙遇冻就掉的困难。哈尔滨科学研究部门正在对这个先进技术进行技术鉴定。
    在采取各种防寒保温技术措施的同时，哈尔滨基建部门还层层建立了气象情报网，预先掌握一周内的气候变化情况，以采取各种预防措施。此外，对冬季施工工人的防寒保温也都进行了妥善安排。
