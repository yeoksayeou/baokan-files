Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 3rd: The Czechoslovak government, in a reply to the West German government on December 2nd, pointed out that the recent crash of a West German jet bomber on Czechoslovak territory, as well as repeated violations of Czechoslovak airspace, demonstrate that the Bonn government is determined to continue its "Cold War" policy and attempts to use such provocative actions to maintain and exacerbate tensions in Europe. The Czechoslovak government's reply was in response to the West German government's note of November 30 regarding the aforementioned incidents.

The reply pointed out that the two West German pilots who parachuted to Czechoslovak territory after the crash of the two aircraft would be expelled and handed over to the West German authorities on December 2, once the matter had been dealt with. The reply emphasized that the West German government should draw the necessary conclusions and prevent such violations and provocative incidents from occurring in its relations with other countries.

In view of the fact that the West German government has not only failed to offer the necessary apology and guarantees to take measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again, but has also carried out large-scale anti-Czechoslovak propaganda in newspapers, "the Czechoslovak government has to insist that the West German government fully guarantee that it will no longer violate Czechoslovak airspace." The reply reiterated that the Bonn government should bear a heavy responsibility for similar incidents.

    捷克斯洛伐克政府复照西德政府
    抗议西德侵犯捷领空
    新华社布拉格3日电　捷克斯洛伐克政府2日在一份答复西德政府的复照中指出，最近西德喷气式轰炸机在捷克斯洛伐克领土上坠毁以及再次侵犯捷克斯洛伐克领空的事件说明，波恩政府一意继续奉行“冷战”政策，并企图用这种挑衅性的行动来保持和加剧欧洲的紧张局势。捷克斯洛伐克政府的复照是答复西德政府11月30日关于上述事件的照会的。
    复照指出，在两架飞机坠毁以后用降落伞降落到捷克斯洛伐克领土上的两名西德飞行员，一俟处理完毕，将于12月2日被驱逐出境并移交给西德当局。复照强调说，西德政府应该得出必要的结论，在同怜国的关系中制止这种侵犯和挑衅性事件发生。
    鉴于西德政府不但没有表示应有的道歉、保证采取措施以防止再次发生类似的事件，反而在报纸上大肆进行敌视捷克斯洛伐克的宣传，“捷克斯洛伐克政府不得不坚持要求西德政府充分保证不再侵犯捷克斯洛伐克领空”。复照再次强调，对类似的事件，波恩政府应负重大责任。
