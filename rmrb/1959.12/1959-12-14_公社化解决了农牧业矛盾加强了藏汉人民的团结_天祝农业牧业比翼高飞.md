    (Report from our newspaper) After communization in the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, Gansu Province, the original contradictions between agriculture and animal husbandry were resolved, and the unity between the Tibetan and Han peoples was strengthened. A prosperous situation emerged where Tibetan and Han people supported each other, overcame severe drought, and created a situation where agriculture and animal husbandry soared together.
    In the first year of communization, both agriculture and animal husbandry faced unprecedented difficulties due to prolonged drought. Since last winter, the agricultural areas had experienced little rain and snow, and this year's rainfall and river flow were only 40% to 50% of those in 1958. The soil was dry and the land could not be sown. The pastoral areas encountered severe blizzards in early spring, with snow covering the grasslands and livestock lacking forage. Drought and cold spring weather posed a serious threat to farmers and herders. First, the agricultural areas launched a vigorous campaign to support the pastoral areas in overcoming the spring cold and protecting livestock and lambs. Communes in agricultural areas such as Gulang and Huangyangchuan, and the Manjiatan Farm, dispatched more than 200 carts to transport more than one million jin of fodder to the pastoral areas day and night. The Zhuaxixiulong Grassland Ranch was short of grass and telephoned the Huangyangchuan Commune for help. At dawn, the Huangyangchuan Commune sent more than 7,000 jin of wheat straw from 80 li away, and Manjiatan sent another 5,000 jin of feed to help herdsmen feed the livestock. Eleven agricultural production teams in the Yongfeng Commune sent more than 400 people to help the pastoral teams deliver grass and welcome lambs, overcoming the spring cold. The Gulang, Dajing, and Tumen communes in the warmer northern agricultural areas vacated pastures to welcome the neighboring Haxi Commune to graze livestock, reducing the difficulties caused by insufficient transportation capacity and avoiding the threat of severe cold. The Haxi Commune organized a traveling grazing team, driving bulls and rams to graze in the agricultural areas for 800 li. Wherever they went, farmers vacated houses, lent corrals, sent grass, and lent feed, treating them like honored guests. Although the farmers themselves suffered from the severe threat of drought, they generously sent the water they had painstakingly collected drop by drop in cellars through rain and snow to the pastoral areas to rescue livestock. When lambing began, the agricultural areas selected and dispatched more than 100 experienced farmers to support the pastoral areas.
    While the agricultural areas were supporting the pastoral areas and fighting the spring cold, the pastoral areas also launched a vigorous campaign to support the agricultural areas in combating drought. Herders dug wells and pits on the crisscrossing grasslands, and people and livestock switched to using well water, saving river water to irrigate more farmland downstream. Farmers from the Wuwei Zhangyi Commune went to the Xitan Brigade of the Haxi Commune upstream to build canals. The Tibetan people gave up their forage land to dig canals, provided tents, found firewood, and mobilized livestock to help transport materials. Livestock teams from Yongfeng and Huangyangchuan Communes sent 300 pairs of livestock to support the Tumen Commune in deep plowing the land to enhance soil moisture retention. The Qilian and Haxi Communes, located upstream, helped the Xiying Commune downstream store water for irrigation. The Shiquangou Production Team of the Jinqiang Pastoral Commune supported the Shuangta Brigade of the Gulang Town Commune, which was 150 li away, with 900 carts of pure sheep manure. With the support of the Tibetan herders, not only did the Han agricultural areas in the county receive a large amount of fertilizer, but the neighboring Wuwei County also transported dozens of train cars of fine fertilizer from the Tianzhu pastoral areas. Thanks to the strong support from the pastoral areas, the construction of water conservancy projects by farmers, and the development of a fertilizer accumulation campaign, the water and fertilizer supply in the agricultural areas has greatly improved. This year, the county's cultivated land averaged 35,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, an increase of 5,000 jin compared to last year. Although they encountered severe drought, with rainfall reduced by more than half, the irrigated area increased by 26% compared to last year.
    This kind of mutual support and cooperation between agriculture and animal husbandry has now become institutionalized. When the summer harvest began this year, the pastoral areas dispatched thousands of pack animals to help the agricultural areas rush to harvest and transport crops quickly. As soon as the summer harvest was completed, the agricultural areas, in addition to retaining a large portion of the labor force to protect the autumn crops and harvest them, immediately extracted thousands of laborers, driving carts and pulling wood, to support the pastoral areas in building sheds and storing feed grass as early as possible. This year, the county completed the construction of 13,500 permanent sheds in advance by one month, compared to only simple temporary sheds last year; and stored more than 51.6 million jin of winter grass, an increase of more than 36 million jin compared to last year. Under the severe threat of drought and spring cold, both agriculture and animal husbandry have achieved bumper harvests. This year, the grain yield per mu reached 348 jin, an increase of 46 jin compared to the extraordinarily abundant harvest of 1958 when the weather was favorable; and the net increase in livestock over the past year was more than 100,000 head, with a net increase rate of 13%.

    公社化解决了农牧业矛盾加强了藏汉人民的团结
    天祝农业牧业比翼高飞
    本报讯　甘肃天祝藏族自治县在公社化后，解决了原来的农业和牧业矛盾，加强了藏民和汉民的团结，出现了藏民、汉民互相支援，战胜了严重的干旱，创造出农业牧业比翼高飞的繁荣局面。
    公社化的头一年，由于久旱不雨，使农牧业都面临了空前的困难。农业区自去冬以来一直雨雪稀少、今年的降雨量和河流的流水量只有1958年的40％—50％，土干地旱无法下种；牧业区开春就碰到了特大的暴风雪，雪压草原，牲畜缺草。干旱和春寒给农、牧民带来了严重的威胁。首先，农业区展开了轰轰烈烈的支援牧区战胜春寒，保畜保羔的运动。古浪、黄羊川等农业区公社和满家滩农场出动了两百多辆大车，不分昼夜给牧区运送草料共百多万斤。抓喜秀龙草原牧场牲畜缺草，打电话向黄羊川公社求援。天黎明，黄羊川公社从八十里外送来了七千多斤麦草，满家滩又送来了五千斤料，帮助放牧员饲养牲畜。永丰公社十一个农业生产队，派出四百多人帮助牧业队送草、接羔，战胜春寒。天气较暖的北部农业区古浪、大靖、土门公社，腾出草场，欢迎邻近的哈溪公社将牲畜赶来放牧，以减少运输力不足的困难和避免严寒的威胁。哈溪公社组织了旅行放牧队。赶着公牛、羯羊在农区游牧了八百里。所到之处，农民腾房让圈送草借料，待如嘉宾。农民虽然自己遭受干旱的严重威胁，却慷慨地将自己冒雨踏雪一点一滴收储起来的窖水，送到牧区抢救畜群。产羔开始了，农业区选派了一百多名有经验的农民支援牧区。
    在农区支援牧区和春寒搏斗的同时，牧区也展开了热火朝天的支援农业区的抗旱斗争。牧民在水流纵横的草原上纷纷挖井掏坑，人畜改用井水，节约河水让下游多灌溉农田。武威张义公社农民到上游的哈溪公社西滩大队修渠，藏民把自己的饲料地让出来挖渠，并且给腾帐篷，找烧柴，出动牲畜帮助驮运材料。永丰、黄羊川公社的畜牧队派出三百对牲畜，支援土门公社深翻土地，增强土壤保墒能力。地处上游的祁连、哈溪公社帮助下游西营公社蓄水灌地。金强牧业公社石圈沟生产队给远在一百五十里外的古浪镇公社双塔大队支援纯羊粪九百车。在藏族牧民的支援下，不仅全县汉族农业区得到了大批的肥料，相邻的武威县也从天祝牧区运走精肥几十火车。由于得到了牧区的大力支援和农民兴修了水利工程，开展了积肥运动，农业区水、肥供应情况有很大改善。全县耕地今年每亩平均施肥三万五千斤，比去年增加了五千斤。虽然遇到了严重的干旱，降雨量减少了一半以上，灌溉面积比去年还增加了26％。
    这种农牧业之间的相互支援，互相协作，现在已形成了制度。今年夏收开始，牧区又出动了成千的驮牧，帮助农区抢收快运。夏收一完，农区除留一大部劳力保秋，收秋外，立即抽出数千名劳力，赶着大车，拉着木料，支援牧区及早修搭棚圈和割贮饲草。今年全县提前一月搭成房厦式固定棚圈一万三千五百间，去年还只有简易临时棚；打贮冬草五千一百六十多万斤，比去年增加三千六百多万斤。在严重的干旱和春寒的威胁下，农业牧业均获丰收。今年粮食亩产达三百四十八斤，比风调雨顺特大丰收的1958年还提高了四十六斤；一年来净增牲畜十万多头，净增率达13％。
