Skillful Pig Raising
    Ding Shan

How many pigs can one pig farmer raise? With the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry, should we continuously and massively increase the labor force for pig raising, or should we continuously reform breeding techniques to raise more pigs with as little labor as possible? This is a new question raised under new circumstances.

Currently, a pig farmer generally raises about twenty pigs. Wuxiang County in Shanxi Province once did the math: the county currently has 86,000 pigs in stock, with 4,300 pig farmers, accounting for slightly less than 13% of the county's total labor force; if the efficiency of pig raising is not improved, the county plans to develop 260,000 pigs next year, which would require 13,000 pig farmers, accounting for 40% of the total labor force. The rural labor force is already tight, and with the development of various undertakings, labor shortage remains a widespread problem. If too much labor is used for pig raising, it will inevitably affect the development of other production undertakings. Then, since there is a shortage of labor, can we slow down the development speed of pig raising a bit? We cannot. Whether from the perspective of developing agricultural production or improving people's lives, it is necessary to develop the pig-raising industry at high speed. Only by raising more pigs can we accumulate more fertilizer, increase production, and eat more meat. The Party Central Committee calls on us to vigorously raise pigs, and the masses demand to raise more pigs. Rapidly developing the pig-raising industry is an unshakable policy.

Pigs need to develop at high speed, but there is a shortage of labor. This is the contradiction. The only way to resolve the contradiction is to raise pigs skillfully and seek labor from technology. Continuously reforming breeding techniques and improving breeding efficiency, using fewer people to raise more pigs, is the fundamental way to solve this problem. In this regard, Wujiapo Management Area in Fushan County, Shanxi Province, the pig farm of Gucheng Commune in Wuxiang County, and Suiyang Commune in Meitan County, Guizhou Province, and other units have already set an example and created experience. Because they attach importance to technological reform, the number of pigs raised by each breeder has increased from an average of about twenty to more than forty or even about one hundred, which has increased the efficiency by multiples, even several times. It is for this reason that although the number of pigs raised by Suiyang Commune is currently 83% higher than in February, the number of pig farmers has been reduced from 3,800 in the past to 2,200, saving 1,600 labor forces, and the labor intensity has been reduced, and the quality of breeding has been improved. This is the benefit of skillful pig raising.

Improving breeding efficiency is not a very difficult task. Because the pig-raising industry that has developed in large quantities at present is mainly collective breeding, and the breeding is concentrated, which is convenient for implementing technological reforms. The key to implementing technological reform is to reform tools and use simple machinery to replace manual operations in the breeding process as much as possible. Wuxiang County in Shanxi Province once conducted a survey and found that the most labor-intensive work in pig raising is feed processing, carrying water, padding pens, boiling materials, pulling bellows, and cutting vegetables. However, whether it is processing tools, transportation tools, or stoves, all regions have already made a lot of reforms since the Great Leap Forward last year. We can not only use some of the improved tools that have been effective in agricultural production, water conservancy construction, and people's lives in breeding work, but also use them as a reference and adapt them to the needs of breeding work, making necessary reforms. In the tool reform movement in recent years, all regions have trained a large number of technical teams, and the masses have an urgent demand for tool reform. Now, as long as the leadership raises this issue and fully mobilizes the masses, it will not take too long to widely use simple machinery in the pig-raising process and greatly improve the efficiency of pig raising.

    巧养猪
    丁山
    一个饲养员能养多少头猪？随着养猪事业的高速度发展，我们是不断地、大量地增加养猪的劳动力，还是不断地改革饲养技术，以尽量少的劳动力养更多的猪呢？这是新情况下提出的新问题。
    目前，一般是一个饲养员养二十头猪左右。山西武乡县曾经算过一笔账：全县现有存栏猪八万六千头，有饲养员四千三百人，占全县总劳动力13％弱；如果不提高饲养工效，明年全县计划发展到二十六万头猪，就需要一万三千个饲养员，占总劳动力40％。农村劳动力本来就很紧张，随着各项事业的发展，劳动力不足依然是一个带有普遍性的问题，如果以过多的劳动力来养猪，必然会影响其它各项生产事业的发展。那么，既然劳动力不足，是不是可以把养猪的发展速度放慢一点呢？也不能，无论从发展农业生产还是从改善人民生活的角度看，都需要高速度地发展养猪事业。只有多养猪，才能多积肥、多增产，也才能多吃肉。党中央号召我们大力养猪，群众要求多养猪，迅速发展养猪事业是不可动摇的方针。
    猪要高速度地发展，劳动力又不足，这就是矛盾。解决矛盾的唯一办法是巧养猪，向技术要劳力。不断改革饲养技术，提高饲养工效，用更少的人养更多的猪，是解决这个问题的根本办法。在这方面，山西浮山县吴家坡管理区和武乡县故城公社养猪场，贵州湄潭县绥阳公社等单位已经做出了榜样，创造了经验。他们由于重视技术改革，饲养员已经由平均一人饲养二十头左右提高到四十多头以至一百头左右，比原来的工效成倍、几倍地提高了。正是这个原因，绥阳公社目前养猪数量虽然比2月份增加了83％，饲养员却由过去的三千八百人减到二千二百人，节省了一千六百个劳动力，而且劳动强度减轻了，饲养质量提高了。这就是巧养猪的好处。
    提高饲养工效不是一件很困难的事。因为目前大量发展起来的，是以集体饲养为主的养猪事业，饲养集中，就便于实行技术改革。实行技术改革，关键在于改革工具，尽量用简易机械代替饲养过程中的手工操作。山西武乡县曾经作过调查，养猪工作中浪费劳力最多的，是饲料加工，担水、垫圈和煮料拉风箱、切菜等工作。但是，不论是加工工具还是运输工具和灶具，各地从去年大跃进以来，已经有了大量的改革，我们不仅可以把这些在农业生产、水利建设和人民生活中已经用之有效的一部分改良工具用到饲养工作中来，也可以它们为借鉴，适应饲养工作的需要，加以必要的改革。在近几年的工具改革运动中，各地已经培养了大批的技术队伍，群众对改革工具有着迫切的要求。现在只要领导上把这个问题提出来，充分发动群众，不用太长时间，就可以在养猪过程广泛使用简易机械，大大提高养猪的工效。
