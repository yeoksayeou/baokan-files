Train Flies Across the Yangtze River Second Bridge

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 10th: The Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing has been successfully completed, and the Yu (Chongqing) Gan (Ganshui) section of the northern section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway has also been connected. Today, approximately ten thousand people gathered here to solemnly celebrate the completion of the bridge and the connection of the Sichuan-Guizhou and Chengdu-Chongqing railways.
    Today, the magnificent Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge was decked out in festive attire. The silver-gray bridge was decorated with lanterns and colorful banners. Tall arches were erected at both ends of the bridge, and huge banners were hung on the steel beams of the bridge. On the river, ships with colorful flags sailed back and forth. The Chengdu-Chongqing road, from Caiyuanba Station in Chongqing to Tongguanyi Station, and the stations along the Yugan Line, were all decorated with joy and festive scenes. People from Chongqing City and Jiangjin Prefecture came to participate in the connection and opening ceremony, and rushed from all directions before dawn. The railway lines near the bridge were filled with cheering crowds.
    At 11:10 AM, the ceremony began. Thunderous applause and artillery salutes echoed through the venue. Colorful balloons with slogans such as "Long Live the General Line" and "Celebrating the Great Victory of the Early Completion of the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge" floated slowly into the clear sky. Zhao Cangbi, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, delivered a speech first. He said: In the face of the current excellent situation, and amidst the successive reports of many enterprises in the country and the province that have completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule and exceeded their quotas, the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing has been successfully opened to traffic! At the same time, the newly built section of the Yugan section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway has also been successfully opened to traffic! This is an outstanding achievement among the great achievements made by our country in the basic construction front in 1959, and a great happy event for the people of Sichuan Province and the whole country.
    Sun Xianyu, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said: The opening of the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge and the Yugan Line provides favorable conditions for the development of industrial and agricultural production in Chongqing. After the opening of traffic, materials needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives can be directly transported across the river and quickly to where they are needed.
    Huang Rongchang, Director of the Railway Ministry's Bridge Engineering Bureau, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Chengdu Railway Bureau, and well-known labor model, also spoke at the meeting, warmly congratulating the bridge, the Yugan Line, and the Chengdu-Chongqing Line on their connection and opening to traffic.
    At 11:35 AM, the first train departing from Caiyuanba Station in Chongqing passed through the bridge and headed straight for Ganshui along the Yugan Line.
    The Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing is connected to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in the north and the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, which is about to be completed, in the south, making Chongqing a hub for these two railways. The opening of this bridge will more closely connect China's capital, Beijing, with the remote southwest through the Beijing-Guangzhou, Longhai, Baoji-Chengdu, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Sichuan-Guizhou lines. The opening of this bridge will play a huge role in further connecting the southwest and northwest regions, especially the material exchanges between Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, and promoting economic prosperity. In the past, due to the obstruction of the Yangtze River and the lack of construction of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, the transportation of materials between Sichuan and Guizhou was extremely inconvenient. Steel, machinery, and equipment transported from Chongqing and other parts of Sichuan to Guizhou often had to go through the Chengdu-Chongqing, Baoji-Chengdu, Longhai, and Beijing-Guangzhou railways, or be transported by the Yangtze River, and then be transferred by the Guiqian or Xiangqian railways, taking almost half of China to reach Guizhou. Minerals, coal, coke, pig iron, etc. transported from Guizhou Province and southeastern Sichuan to Chongqing had to rely entirely on manual labor and wooden boats to transport them to the factory area on the opposite bank after they were transported to the south bank of the Yangtze River in Chongqing, often taking several days. After the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge is opened to traffic and the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway is completed, the inconvenient transportation between Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can be greatly changed, the transportation volume can be increased, the transportation time can be shortened, and transportation costs can be saved.
    The Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing is a double-track railway bridge entirely designed and constructed by our country's technical staff. The bridge is 820 meters long and began construction in September 1958, originally planned to be completed in two years. Under the leadership of the Party, our country's bridge experts and bridge workers gave full play to their soaring energy and infinite wisdom, resolutely implemented the general construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and successively realized more than 10,000 technical innovation proposals, so that this bridge was completed in only fourteen months, and the quality was excellent, demonstrating the glorious victory of the Party's general line. After national acceptance, the steel beam deflection, riveting quality, the stability of all pier foundations, and the compressive strength of the pier concrete specimens all meet the design standards. In the design and construction of the bridge, the bridge construction workers did everything possible to save steel, machinery, and various materials, saving the state's investment of 570,000 yuan and reducing project costs by 890,000 yuan.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 10th: At the same time as the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing was successfully opened to traffic, the northern section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway—the newly built section from Chongqing to Ganshui—was also opened to traffic.
    The newly built section of the Yugan section is 32 kilometers long. It is the beginning of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway. It passes through the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge and connects to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in Xiaonanhai, Chongqing.
    After the newly built Yugan Line and the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing are opened to traffic, the rich minerals and coal in southeastern Sichuan can be directly transported to the industrial and mining areas on the north bank of the Yangtze River without hindrance. The south-bound materials no longer need to be moved back and forth several times and carried across the river by boat.
    The Yugan section of the railway started construction in January of this year. It is located in the hilly area of southeastern Sichuan, with intricate mountains and rivers, and the amount of earth and stone work is particularly large. In just a few dozen miles, 5.01 million cubic meters of earth and stone must be excavated and filled, and there are 104 large and small bridges and culverts, and two tunnels. The workers who built this section of the line, under the leadership of the Party, worked selflessly and without fear of difficulties. They completed the construction task with more, faster, better, and more economical results under the conditions of tight schedule, heavy tasks, and few machines. They put forward more than 7,000 rationalization proposals, promoted 42 types of 1,958 small machines, and saved the state more than 1.6 million yuan in construction costs and more than 258,000 labor days.

    重庆万人举行庆祝盛典
    渝赶线建成，川黔成渝两铁路接轨
    火车飞跨长江第二桥
    新华社重庆10日电　重庆市白沙沱长江大桥胜利建成，川黔铁路北段渝（重庆）赶（赶水）线也已接轨。今天约有一万多人在这里隆重举行了庆祝大桥和川黔、成渝两条铁路接轨通车典礼。
    今天，雄伟的白沙沱长江大桥披上了节日的盛装，银灰色的桥上张灯结彩，遍插红旗，两边桥头搭起高大的牌楼，大桥的钢梁上横挂着巨幅标语。大江上，彩旗飘飘的船只，往来行驶。成渝路上从重庆的菜园坝车站到铜罐驿车站，和渝赶线沿途各站，都打扮得喜气洋洋，充满节日景象。从重庆市、江津专区前来参加接轨通车典礼的人们，天不亮就从四面八方赶来，大桥附近的铁路线两旁，到处人群欢腾。
    上午十一点十分，典礼开始举行。会场上掌声雷动，礼炮轰鸣，五彩的气球挂着“总路线万岁”“庆祝白沙沱长江大桥提前完成的伟大胜利”等标语，冉冉飞向晴空。中共四川省委书记处书记赵苍璧首先致词。他说：在目前大好的形势面前，在全国、全省许多企业相继提前超额完成今年国家计划的报捷声中，重庆市白沙沱长江大桥胜利通车了！与此同时，川黔铁路渝赶段新建部分也胜利通车了！这是我国1959年在基本建设战线上所取得的巨大成就中出色的一件，是四川省和全国人民的一件大喜事。
    中共重庆市委书记孙先余在会上讲话。他说：白沙沱长江大桥与渝赶线通车，对重庆市的工农业生产发展提供了有利条件。通车以后，工农业生产建设和人民生活需要的物资，都可以直接过江，很快地运到需要的地方去。
    铁道部大桥工程局局长，成都铁路局党委书记，著名劳动模范黄荣昌等，也在会上讲了话，热烈祝贺大桥和渝赶线、成渝线接轨通车。
    十一点三十五分，由重庆菜园坝车站开出的第一列火车通过大桥，沿着渝赶线直往赶水驶去。
    重庆市白沙沱长江大桥北接成渝铁路，南连即将建成的川黔铁路，重庆成为这两条铁路的枢纽。这座大桥的通车，使我国的首都北京，通过京广、陇海、宝成、成渝和川黔等线路，和边远的西南更紧密地连接起来。这座大桥的通车，对进一步沟通西南和西北地区，特别是四川和贵州两省之间的物资交流，促进经济繁荣，将起巨大的作用。过去，因为大江阻隔和川黔铁路没有修建，四川和贵州之间的物资运输极不方便。由重庆和四川其他地区运往贵州的钢材、机器设备等，往往要经过成渝、宝成、陇海、京广等铁路或由长江水运，再由黔桂或湘黔铁路转运，差不多绕半个中国才能运到贵州。由贵州省和四川东南部运往重庆的矿石、煤焦、生铁等，运到重庆长江南岸后，全靠人力和木船运输，往往要辗转几天才能运到对岸的工厂区。白沙沱长江大桥通车和川黔铁路建成后，就可以大大改变四川、贵州两省之间运输不便的状况，增加运量，缩短运输时间和节约运费。
    重庆市白沙沱长江大桥，完全是由我国的技术员工自己设计和施工的双线铁路桥，大桥全长八百二十米，从1958年9月开始动工，原计划两年建成。我国的桥梁专家和桥梁工人们在党的领导下，充分发挥了冲天干劲和无穷智慧，坚决贯彻了多快好省的建设方针，先后实现了一万多件技术革新建议，使这座大桥只经十四个月就修建完成，而且质量优良，显示出党的总路线的光辉胜利。经过国家验收，大桥的钢梁挠度，铆合质量，所有墩台基础的稳固程度，以及墩身混凝土试件的抗压强度等，都符合设计规定标准。在大桥的设计和施工中，建桥职工千方百计地节约钢材、机具和各种材料，节约了国家投资五十七万元，降低了工程成本八十九万元。
    新华社重庆10日电　在重庆市白沙沱长江大桥胜利通车的同时，川黔铁路北段——重庆到赶水段新建线路也建成通车了。
    渝赶段新建部分全长三十二公里。它是川黔铁路的开端。它通过重庆长江大桥，在重庆的小南海同成渝铁路接轨。
    新建的渝赶线和重庆市白沙沱长江大桥通车后，四川东南部丰富的矿石、煤等物资，就可以畅通无阻地直接运到长江北岸的工矿区；南运的物资，也不必再三番五次地搬运，用船载过江了。
    渝赶段铁路是今年1月动工的。它处于四川东南部的丘陵地带，山脉河流错综，土石方工程量特别大，短短几十里就要挖填土石方五百零一万立方米，还有大小桥梁和涵渠一百零四座，隧道两座。修建这段线路的职工们，在党的领导下，不畏艰难地、忘我地劳动着。他们在工期紧、任务重、机具少的情况下，多快好省地完成了施工任务。他们共提出了七千多条合理化建议，推广了四十二种共一千九百五十八件小型机具，为国家节约了修建费用一百六十多万元，节约二十五万八千多个劳动日。（附图片）
