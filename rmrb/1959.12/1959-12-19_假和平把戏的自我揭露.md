    The Self-Exposure of the False Peace Trick
    Xinhua News Agency commentary

    These past few days, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in Paris has been noisy and clamorous, making people see through the United States ruling group's peace charade even more clearly.

    Just as U.S. President Eisenhower was traveling abroad talking about peace everywhere, U.S. Secretary of State Herter and Secretary of Defense Gates were shouting in secret consultations with allies in Paris that military expansion must be stepped up. Herter presented a new ten-year plan to strengthen the North Atlantic Group at the meeting. The actual goal of this plan, which is touted as seeking so-called "secure peace," is to further tighten the screws on the North Atlantic military machine. The core of this plan is to maintain "a strong military system" that must have both the "deterrent power" to conduct "large-scale wars" and the "full flexibility" to conduct "local wars." The Paris meeting communiqué has already instructed the permanent representatives of the North Atlantic Group to formulate details based on Herter's blueprint, and to make "firm efforts to ensure the necessary strength of the alliance" in the military field.

    The United States recently voted in favor of a disarmament proposal in the United Nations. The Paris meeting communiqué also stated that "universal and supervised disarmament is the goal of the West." However, the North Atlantic aggressive and war machine driven by the United States is planning to greatly expand its armaments in the next ten years. Where is the sincerity of the United States and its followers in their disarmament talks?

    U.S. government leaders have recently repeatedly assured verbally that their deepest desire is to "live in peace" and that they are prepared to establish peaceful "rules of the game." But what about the actual actions of the United States? Seeing its backwardness in intercontinental missiles, the United States is not only concentrating its efforts on developing intercontinental missiles at home, but also attempting to greatly strengthen its strategic deployment in Western Europe at the Paris meeting. Under the slogan of U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates' so-called "modernizing Western defense" and the plan of U.S. General Norstad to establish a "fourth nuclear force" in Western Europe, the United States wants to build more medium-range missile bases in Western Europe, store more nuclear weapons, and equip Western European countries with more atomic missile forces. The United States also insists that the North Atlantic Group achieve the "minimum goal" of building thirty "operationally ready" ground divisions, and insists on the "air force integration plan," requiring Western European countries to provide more ground troops and to hand over their air forces to the United States for unified command. All of this cannot be described as a peaceful competition or the pursuit of peace. It is simply a frantic nuclear arms race and is stepping up preparations for a new war of aggression.

    U.S. government leaders have also recently reiterated that the only message the United States transmits to the world is "peace and friendship in freedom," and that the United States "does not seek territory, selfish interests, or unfair advantages for itself anywhere," and so on. However, at the Paris meeting, the United States was precisely asking Western European countries to provide more territory to house U.S. missiles and nuclear weapons, and to provide more manpower to serve as the front-line cannon fodder in the war for the United States. The United States also wants to spend less money on the North Atlantic's accelerated military expansion plan, while forcing Western European countries to bear a greater "share" of military spending. These are the real messages that the Herter clique brings to Western Europe.

    Before and after the Paris meeting, people heard various armed timetables of the United States. The United States is implementing the "Five-Year Plan" for 1959-1963 in order to accelerate the development of intercontinental missiles. The Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Group is implementing a plan to establish one hundred atomic missile battalions in Western Europe by 1963. The United States insisted at the North Atlantic Conference that the military expansion plan must be completed before 1963, and the West German militarists also declared their determination to fulfill the original goal of completing the army building by 1963. These timetables precisely show that the U.S. ruling group is currently most concerned with buying time to strengthen its strength and prepare for war.

    假和平把戏的自我揭露
    新华社记者述评
    这几天北大西洋集团会议在巴黎开得吵吵嚷嚷，使得人们更加看透了美国统治集团的和平西洋镜。
    正当美国总统艾森豪威尔出国访问到处谈论和平的时候，美国国务卿赫脱和国防部长盖茨在巴黎同盟国秘密会商中大喊大叫必须加紧扩充军备。赫脱在会议上提出了加强北大西洋集团的新的十年计划。这个号称是谋求所谓“安全的和平”的计划，实际目标却在进一步扭紧北大西洋军事机器的螺丝钉。这个计划的核心是保持“一项强大的军事体系”，它既要有进行“大规模战争”的“威慑力量”，又要有进行“局部战争”的“充分灵活性”。巴黎会议公报已经训令北大西洋集团常设代表根据赫脱的蓝图拟订细节，在军事方面“作坚定的努力来保证联盟的必要的力量”。
    美国不久前刚在联合国里投票赞成过裁军提案，巴黎会议公报里也表示什么“普遍的有监督的裁军是西方的目标”，但是，美国驾驭的这架北大西洋侵略和战争机器却要在今后十年内大搞扩充军备，美国及其跟随者裁军谈论的诚意在哪里呢？
    美国政府领导人最近在口头上一再保证他们最深切的愿望是在“和平中生活”，准备订出和平“比赛规则”，但是美国的实际行动又如何呢？美国看到它在洲际导弹上的落后状态，不仅在国内集中力量发展洲际导弹，而且在巴黎会议上企图大肆加强在西欧的战略部署。在美国国防部长盖茨所谓“使西方防务现代化”的口号和美国将军诺斯塔德所谓在西欧建立“第四核力量”的计划下，美国要在西欧建立更多的中程导弹基地，储存更多的核武器，给西欧盟国装备更多的原子导弹部队。美国还坚持北大西洋集团建成三十个“完成作战准备”地面师的“最低目标”，坚持“空军整体化方案”，要西欧盟国提供更多的地面部队，并且要盟国把它们的空军部队也交给美国统一指挥。凡此种种，怎能说得上和平竞赛、追求和平，它只是疯狂的核军备竞赛，是在加紧准备新的侵略战争。
    美国政府领导人最近还再三表示美国传给全世界的唯一信息是“在自由中的和平和友谊”，美国“不想在任何地方为自己寻求领土、自私的利益或者不公平的好处”等等。但是，就在巴黎会议上，美国却正是要西欧盟国提供更多的领土来安置美国导弹和核武器，提供更多的人力来给美国充当战争里的头阵炮灰。美国还想在北大西洋加紧扩军计划里自己少掏腰包，而逼着西欧盟国在军费负担上承担更大的“份额”。赫脱之流带给西欧的真正信息就是这些。
    在巴黎会议前后，人们听到了美国的种种武装时间表。美国为了加紧发展洲际导弹正在执行1959—1963年“五年计划”。北大西洋集团最高司令部正在执行到1963年在西欧建立一百个原子导弹营的计划。美国在北大西洋会议上坚持必须在1963年以前完成扩军计划，而西德军国主义者也宣称决心履行原订在1963年完成的建军目标。这些时间表正好说明美国统治集团目前最关心的是赢得时间，以便加强实力，准备战争。
