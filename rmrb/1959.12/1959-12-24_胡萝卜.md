　　Carrots
　　The carrot is a high-yield, nutritious and succulent feed. Therefore, some people call it "feed ginseng."
　　Carrots are sweet and liked by all kinds of livestock. Carrot leaves are also a good feed. Farmers in Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, make it into fermented feed for pigs, and the effect is also very good.
　　Carrots are relatively resistant to low temperatures, so they can be planted in both the South and the North. In the North, they are generally planted in summer and harvested in autumn, with a yield of about 5,000 catties per mu. In the South, they are planted in late autumn and harvested in late winter or early spring, with a yield of 3,000 to 4,000 catties. (Attached picture)

　　胡萝卜
    胡萝卜是一种产量高，营养好的多汁饲料。所以有人叫它为“饲料人参”。
    胡萝卜味甜，各种牲畜喜吃。胡萝卜的叶子也是很好的饲料，浙江省金华县一带的农民，把它作成醱酵饲料喂猪，效果也很好。
    胡萝卜比较能耐低温，所以不论南方、北方都能种植。北方一般是夏季种秋季收，每亩能产五千斤左右；南方则是秋末种，冬末或次春收获，产量三、四千斤。（附图片）
