    The history of relying entirely on purchasing goods from other places has ended.
    Qinghai produces more than 2,000 kinds of light industrial products this year.
    (Our Newspaper) The nearly 60,000 employees on the light industrial front in Qinghai Province are vigorously opposing right-leaning tendencies and going all out to strive to make most of the main products self-sufficient next year, support industrial and agricultural production, and meet the ever-increasing living needs of all ethnic groups in Qinghai.
    In the ten years since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the face of light industry and handicrafts in Qinghai Province has undergone profound and tremendous changes. Last year, the variety of light industrial and handicraft products in the province increased from more than 30 in the early days of liberation to more than 1,000, and this year it has increased to more than 2,000. Many products that could not be produced in the past, or even dared not be thought of, such as plastic products, rubber products, glass products, machine-made paper, rayon, knitted goods, etc., can now be produced by ourselves. Currently, among the more than 3,700 kinds of daily necessities of light industrial and handicraft products, more than 700 kinds such as matches, soap, and milk powder can be self-sufficient, and more than 1,300 kinds have reached semi-self-sufficiency. The number of employees in the existing light industry and handicrafts industry has increased more than nine times compared with the early days of liberation. Many enterprises have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization.
    Now, more and more light industrial and handicraft products produced in the province are on the market. Qinghai Province has ended the situation in the past where all kinds of light industrial and handicraft products relied entirely on transportation from other places.
    Last year, in the upsurge of vigorously carrying out mass movements and the whole people running industries, people broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and in a very short period of time, more than 4,200 light industrial and handicraft enterprises were built in various parts of the province and in various people's communes, and more than 500 new products were trial-produced and produced. Many products that were previously thought that could not be done without experts, such as solar stoves and rayon, were manufactured by the masses using their own wisdom and hands. The Qinghai Provincial Wool Textile Factory adopted the policy of using indigenous methods and relying on its own efforts in the absence of machinery and equipment, and manufactured several indigenous textile machines by itself. It has now produced products such as woolen cloth for papermaking, which has timely met the needs of the province's papermaking industry.

    全部依靠外地进货的历史结束了
    青海今年自产轻工业品二千多种
    本报讯　青海省轻工业战线上的近六万职工，大反右倾，大鼓干劲，力争主要产品在明年大部分达到自给，支援工农牧业生产，满足青海各族人民日益增长的生活需要。
    解放十年来，特别在1958年大跃进以来，青海省轻工业和手工业的面貌，发生了深刻、巨大的变化。去年，全省轻工业、手工业产品品种由解放初的三十多种增加到一千多种，今年又增加到二千多种。很多过去不能生产甚至连想都不敢想的产品，如塑料制品、橡胶制品、玻璃用品、机制纸、人造棉、针织品等，也都能够自己生产。当前日常必需的三千七百多种轻工业、手工业产品中，能自给的已有火柴、肥皂、奶粉等七百多种，半自给的已达一千三百多种。现有轻工业、手工业的从业人员，已比解放初期增加了九倍多。很多企业已实现了机械化和半机械化。
    现在，市场上本省所产的轻工业和手工业品越来越多。青海省已经结束了以往各种轻工业、手工业品全赖外地运来的局面。
    去年在大搞群众运动、全民办工业的高潮中，人们破除了迷信，解放了思想，在很短的时间内，全省各地、各人民公社即建起了四千二百多个轻工业、手工业企业，试制和生产了五百多种新产品。过去认为没有专家就不能做的太阳灶、人造棉等很多种产品，群众利用自己的智慧和双手制造出来了。青海省毛纺厂在机器设备未到来的情况下，采用了土法上马、自力更生的方针，自己制造了几台土纺织机，现在已经生产出造纸用的毛布等产品，及时满足了本省造纸工业的需要。
