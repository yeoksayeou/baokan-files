With Communes, We Can Climb to the Peak of Happiness
　　Rouzi Tu'erdi, Director of the Wuxing People's Commune, Turpan County, Xinjiang
　　Our Wuxing People's Commune has been established for a year. To say how powerful it is, it is best to use a Uyghur farmer's proverb: "Our hands are very long, and wherever they reach, they can climb." In this year, we have done many things that we didn't even dare to think about in the past. Cotton, grapes, and grain have all achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, and industrial and sideline production have also made great leaps forward. The total income of various productions is nearly 8 million yuan, an increase of a quarter compared to 1958, and more than 95% of the members have increased their income. In the past, Uyghur farmers who yearned for a happy life would pray to the useless "Khuda" (God), but now the members have the people's commune as their backing. They sing well: "The people's commune is a golden ladder, with it, we can climb to the peak of happiness; the people's commune is an invincible strongman, with it, we can turn the world upside down."
　　Wuxing Commune is an economic crop area, rich in cotton and the seedless white grapes and Hami melons famous throughout the country. However, due to the limited labor force of the agricultural cooperatives, large-scale water conservancy projects could not be built, wind and sand could not be controlled, and the land area could not be expanded. For many years, our agricultural production has not received the development it deserved, and we had to rely on supplies from other places for food. I used to be the director of Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative (now a production team). At that time, the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative had only more than 400 laborers. The cooperative was small and had few people, so we always lost sight of one thing while attending to another, grabbing this end and losing that end. Chairman Mao pointed out the road to the people's commune, and our eyes lit up. Forty-three agricultural cooperatives formed the Wuxing People's Commune, and our members are no longer 1,700 people, but more than 32,000 people. In addition to increasing a large number of laborers in agricultural production, the commune has also established a perennial water conservancy professional team, an industrial professional brigade, and a large number of people engaged in collective welfare. In the face of the powerful power of the commune, natural disasters such as wind, sand, and drought seem very small. The biggest problem that threatened our production development in the past was wind and sand. When the wind rises in the Gobi Desert, sand and rocks fly, often engulfing the karez wells and destroying fields, and many farmlands often turn into sand dunes as a result. After having the commune, we are no longer afraid of it. As soon as the commune was established, it mobilized more than 4,700 laborers and launched a battle to reclaim farmland from the wind and sand and to obtain cotton from nature. In the area with the most severe wind and sand, three sandbreak forest belts were built, 2,100 mu of windbreak forest were planted, and many karez wells that had been buried by wind and sand for many years were excavated and repaired. In one year, we opened up more than 14,000 mu of farmland on the sand dunes. This farmland is equal to the total area of cultivated land expanded by 43 agricultural cooperatives in the past eight years. The Yanmoshi and Huangzhuangzi management areas, which had been unable to raise their heads due to the pressure of wind and sand, opened up 4,169 mu of cultivated land in one year with the help of the commune's large collective, an increase of one-third compared to the cultivated land area in 1958. The total output increased by one and a half times, and the total annual income increased by nearly one time compared to 1958.
　　Our commune happens to be located at the bottom of the "big fire pot" of Turpan. Here, the highest temperature in summer reaches more than 48 degrees Celsius, and eggs can be cooked in the hot ground. However, this place has no rain all year round, and farmland relies entirely on underground karez well water for irrigation. Farmers often describe the preciousness of water, saying that a drop of water is a drop of blood. Before liberation, the most important means for landlords to exploit farmers was to rely on their possession of karez wells. With water, our area can develop production. However, it is difficult to build many karez wells that are several miles long and tens of meters deep with the limited strength of an agricultural cooperative. When I was the director of the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative, I planned to build a canal to divert mountain water with the members every year, but at that time, we could only draw out a dozen or so laborers, and it was never completed. After communization, a perennial water conservancy construction team of more than 500 people was immediately established, and in one year, 230 karez wells were repaired, 34 new karez wells were dug, and a small reservoir was built. The canal that we had dreamed of for many years but could not build has been completed, running more than 20 kilometers across the entire commune and irrigating 2,400 mu of farmland. Now, we are building a reservoir that can irrigate 6,000 mu of land. This project alone requires more than 12,000 workdays. Without the people's commune, who would dare to think of doing such a thing! This year, we went all out and used the power of the large collective to win a great victory in agricultural production. While ensuring the development of economic crops such as cotton and grapes, we achieved self-sufficiency in grain and changed the historical situation of people lacking food and livestock lacking feed. This year, the leap forward in industry and sideline occupations in the commune has been even greater than that in agriculture. Now we have more than 150 production units such as agricultural tool repair and assembly, cotton ginning, oil extraction, flour milling, coal mines, and brick making. The total income of the commune's industry and sideline occupations this year has increased by two times compared to 1958. With the great development of production, the lives of the members have also rapidly improved. The various collective welfare undertakings run by the commune are the fundamental guarantee for continuously improving the living standards of the members. A total of 144 public canteens have been established throughout the commune, and 184 nurseries and kindergartens have been set up. All the elderly who had no one to rely on in the past are living happily in the Homes of Happiness. This year, the commune's total agricultural income alone reached 6.5 million yuan. After deducting production expenses, public accumulation, and members' food expenses, the average income of each member (adults and children) from this item alone was 276 yuan for the whole year, an increase of 26% compared to 1958. As income increased, living standards also improved. This year, the total sales of daily necessities in the commune increased by 39.4% compared to 1958.
　　These days, I have been thinking a lot. Whether I am sleeping or walking, my mind is always thinking about the beautiful picture of the commune in the future. In the past, I always regarded the landlord's manor as the best kind of residence. However, compared with our newly built new residential area, it is simply as small as a rat hole. (Attached picture)

　　有了公社，就能攀登幸福的顶峰
    新疆吐鲁番县五星人民公社主任　肉孜·吐尔的
    我们五星人民公社成立一年了，要说他的力量有多大，最好用我们维吾尔族农民的一句谚语：“我们的手很长，他伸到哪里，就能攀到哪里了”来形容。这一年中，我们办了很多过去连想也不敢想的事情。棉花、葡萄、粮食都获得了空前大丰收，工业、副业生产也有了很大的跃进。各项生产总收入近八百万元，比1958年增加了四分之一，95％以上的社员都增加了收入。过去维吾尔族农民向往幸福生活都去祈求毫无作用的“胡大”（上帝），现在社员有了人民公社靠山。他们唱的好：“人民公社是黄金的梯子，有了他，可以攀登幸福的顶峰；人民公社是无敌的力士，有了他，可以翻天覆地。”
    五星公社是一个经济作物区，盛产棉花和驰名全国的无核白葡萄、哈密瓜。可是由于农业社劳力有限，不能大规模兴修水利，不能治服风沙，土地面积不能扩大，多少年来，我们的农业生产得不到应有的发展，吃粮要靠外地供应。我过去担任五星农业社（现在是生产队）的主任，当时的五星农业社劳动力只有四百多人，社小人少，总是顾此失彼，抓了这头丢了那头。毛主席给我们指出了人民公社化的道路，我们的眼睛亮了。四十三个农业社组成了五星人民公社，我们的社员不是一千七百人，而是三万二千多人了。公社除了在农业生产上增加了大批劳动力以外，还建立了常年水利专业队、工业专业大队和大批的从事集体福利的人员。在公社的强大威力面前，风沙、干旱等自然灾害都显得非常渺小了。过去威胁我们发展生产的最大的问题是风沙。戈壁上大风一起，飞沙走石，往往吞没坎儿井，毁坏田园，很多农田也常因此变成沙丘。有了公社以后，我们再不害怕它了。公社刚一成立，就动员了四千七百多劳力，展开了向风沙要田地，向自然要棉花的战斗。在风沙最严重的地区，营造了三个拦沙林带，栽种了二千一百亩防风林，挖修了许多被风沙埋没多年的坎儿井。一年中，我们在沙丘上开出一万四千多亩农田。这些农田等于过去八年来四十三个农业社扩大耕地面积的总和。被风沙压的一直抬不起头的沿磨石和黄庄子两个管理区，在公社大集体的帮助下，一年就开出四千一百六十九亩耕地，比1958年耕地面积增加了三分之一，总产量增加了一倍半，全年总收入比1958年增加了将近一倍。
    我们公社恰好座落在吐鲁番这个“大火盆”的盆底上。这里，夏天最高温度达到摄氏四十八度多，热地里可以把鸡蛋烫熟。偏偏这地方终年无雨，农田全靠地下坎儿井水灌溉。农民形容水的宝贵，常说一滴水，一滴血。解放以前，地主剥削农民最重要的手段，就是靠他占有坎儿井。有了水，我们这地方才能发展生产。可是要修建许多几里路长、数十米深的坎儿井，靠一个农业社的有限力量是有困难的。我担任五星农业社主任的时候，年年都和社员筹划修一条引山水的水渠，可是当时能抽出的劳动力不过十几个人，始终没有修成。公社化以后，马上成立了一支五百多人的常年水利建设大队，在一年里就修好了二百三十道坎儿井，新挖了三十四道坎儿井，兴修了一座小型水库。我们梦想多年也没法修的渠道，已经修成了，横穿全公社二十多公里，灌溉着二千四百亩农田。现在，我们正在修建一个能灌溉六千亩地的水库，光这一项工程就要一万二千多个劳动日，没有人民公社，谁敢想做这样的事情呢！这一年，我们鼓足干劲，运用大集体的力量，在农业生产上打了一个大胜仗，在保证棉花、葡萄等经济作物发展的同时，达到了粮食自给，改变了历史上人缺口粮、畜无饲料的状况。今年，公社的工业、副业的跃进步伐，比农业还大。现在我们拥有农具修配、轧花、榨油、磨面、煤矿、烧砖等生产单位一百五十多个。全社今年工业、副业总收入比1958年增加了两倍。随着生产大发展，社员的生活也迅速提高了。公社兴办的各种集体福利事业，是不断提高社员生活水平的根本保证。全社共建立了一百四十四个公共食堂，兴办了托儿所、幼儿园一百八十四个。所有过去无依无靠的老人，都在幸福院过着幸福的生活。今年，公社仅农业总收入即达六百五十万元，除去生产开支、公共积累和社员伙食费以外，平均每个社员（大人、小人）全年光这项就收入二百七十六元，比1958年增加了26％。收入增多，生活水平也跟着提高了。今年全社日常生活用品销售量比1958年增加了39.4％。
    这些天来，我自己想的很多。无论睡觉走路，脑子里总是想着公社将来的美丽图景。过去，我总是把地主的庄园看作是最上等的住宅。可是，它和我们的开始建设的新居民点一比，简直渺小得像个老鼠洞。（附图片）
　　多大的颗粒、多大的串啊，吐鲁番今年又是一个葡萄丰收年！
