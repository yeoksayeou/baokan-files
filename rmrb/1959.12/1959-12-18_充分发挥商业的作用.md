     Give Full Play to the Role of Commerce

    In the process of social reproduction, production is of course fundamental and decisive; but distribution, exchange, and consumption are not passively determined by production. On the contrary, distribution, exchange, and consumption can influence or promote the development of production. If distribution and exchange are not handled well, they will affect the development of production and the satisfaction of consumption. If distribution and exchange are done well, they can not only promote the continuous development of production, but also meet the growing social needs. The continuous satisfaction of social consumption needs can in turn promote the development of production. Marx said: "Production appears as the starting point, consumption appears as the end point, and distribution and exchange appear as the intermediary." The interdependent and mutually promoting relationship of production, distribution, exchange, and consumption is determined by objective economic laws and is independent of people's will. Therefore, while vigorously grasping industrial and agricultural production, we must also grasp commerce. Otherwise, focusing only on production without paying attention to circulation is actually an incomplete view of production.

    Under the conditions of a commodity economy, the distribution of social products is realized through commodity exchange. Therefore, given the widespread existence and significant development of commodity production in China today, the commercial sector undertakes the task of distributing a portion of the means of production and all the means of subsistence in social products. The commercial sector plays the role of a link and bridge between production and production, and between production and consumption. If commercial work is done well, it can promote the continuous development of social production and ensure that the ever-growing social needs are reasonably met. Conversely, if commercial work is not done well, it will affect the development of production, and the growing social needs will be difficult to meet. Therefore, doing a good job in commerce is of great political and economic significance for supporting industrial and agricultural production and promoting the continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy.

    To organize the continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy, we should vigorously support the continued Great Leap Forward in agriculture. Agricultural development can open up broad sources of raw materials and sales markets for industrial production, supply more grain and non-staple foods to urban and industrial and mining area residents, open up sources of export goods, and increase the accumulation of the state and communes, and increase the income of commune members. At the same time, with the development of agriculture, the commercial sector is increasingly needed to provide agriculture with more means of production and means of subsistence in a timely manner, and the commercial sector needs to purchase agricultural products in a timely manner. Therefore, the development of agriculture can not only directly promote the development of light industry, but also promote the development of heavy industry, commerce, and transportation. Therefore, the commercial sector must implement the policy of starting from production and serving agricultural production, and do everything possible to ensure the continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. First, we must do a good job in the supply of means of production. Because the means of production are the most fundamental material means in production, especially production tools, such as agricultural machinery, farm tools, fertilizers, pesticides, etc., we must actively organize the supply of goods and reasonably allocate the supply. Implement the policy of planned supply by the state and self-reliance. Secondly, it is currently necessary to actively support the upsurge of large-scale water conservancy construction, and actively do a good job in the supply of materials for water conservancy construction, which is the most important task of current commercial work. At the same time, we must actively support the development of commune-run industries and diversified economic production to meet the needs of water conservancy construction and farmers' lives. Thirdly, the commercial sector must also vigorously support the pig-raising and fertilizer accumulation campaign. This can not only further meet the growing social needs for meat and increase the sources of export goods, but more importantly, it can accumulate fertilizer to nourish fields and increase agricultural production. Fourthly, we must do a good job in the supply of means of subsistence and serve the vast number of consumers. Experience has proved that the commercial sector can guarantee the timely satisfaction of the masses' reasonable needs for daily necessities, which is also a strong support for production.

### 充分发挥商业的作用

     充分发挥商业的作用
    在社会再生产过程中，生产固然是根本的，是起决定作用的；但分配、交换和消费并不是消极地被生产所决定。相反的，分配、交换和消费能够影响或促进生产的发展。如果分配、交换搞不好，就会影响生产的发展和消费的满足。分配、交换搞好了，不仅可以促进生产的不断发展，而且也可以满足日益增长的社会需要。社会消费需要能得到不断的满足，反回来又可以促进生产的发展。马克思说：“生产表现为出发点，消费表现为终点，分配与交换表现为中介”。生产、分配、交换和消费这种相互依存、相互促进的关系，是客观经济规律所决定的，是不以人们意志为转移的。因此，我们在大力抓好工农业生产的同时，还必须抓好商业。否则，只抓生产不抓流通，实际上也是一种不全面的生产观点。
    在商品经济存在的条件下，社会产品的分配是通过商品交换的形式来实现的。因此，在当前我国商品生产还广泛存在，并且将有很大发展的情况下，商业部门承担着社会产品一部分生产资料和全部生活资料的分配任务。商业部门在生产与生产之间、生产与消费之间起着纽带和桥梁的作用。商业工作做好了，就能促进社会生产的不断发展，保证日益增长的社会需要得到合理的满足。反之，商业工作做不好，就要影响生产的发展，日益增长的社会需要也难以得到满足。所以，作好商业工作，对支持工农业生产和促进国民经济继续大跃进，有着十分重要的政治意义和经济意义。
    要组织国民经济继续大跃进，就应大力支持农业的继续大跃进。农业发展，就可以为工业生产开拓广阔的原料来源和销售市场，为城市和工矿区居民供应更多的粮食和副食品，开辟出口物资的货源，并可增加国家和公社的积累，增加社员收入。同时，随着农业的发展，愈来愈需要商业部门及时供应农业更多的生产资料和生活资料，并需要商业部门及时收购农产品。所以，农业发展了，不仅能直接促进轻工业的发展，而且也能促进重工业、商业以及交通运输业的发展。因此，商业部门要贯彻执行从生产出发，为农业生产服务的方针，千方百计地保证农业生产的继续大跃进。首先，要作好生产资料的供应工作。因为生产资料是生产中最根本的物质资料，其中特别是生产工具，如农业机械、农具、化肥、农药等，必须积极组织货源，合理分配供应。贯彻执行国家有计划供应和自力更生两条腿走路的方针。其次，当前必须积极支援大规模的水利建设高潮，积极作好水利建设物资的供应，是当前商业工作头等重要的任务。同时，要积极支持社办工业和多种经济生产的发展，以满足水利建设和农民生活上的需要。其三，商业部门还必须大力支持养猪积肥运动。这样不仅可以进一步满足社会日益增长的肉食需要，增加出口货源，更重要的是可以积肥养田，增加农业生产。其四，必须作好生活资料的供应工作，为广大消费者服务。经验证明，商业部门能够保证及时满足群众对日常生活用品的合理需要，对生产同样是种有力的支持。
