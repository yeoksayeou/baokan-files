　　How to Ensure Full Pregnancy in Sows
    Sichuan Jian'ge Junior Agricultural Technical School
    Our school has sixteen sows. In the past, the empty period was at least sixty days or more, which seriously affected the breeding plan. Over the past year, we have taken some measures, and now we have basically shortened the empty period, eliminated the phenomenon of not coming into heat, and achieved five litters in two years. Our measures are:
    I. Strengthen the feeding and management of breeding stock: According to observation, the main reason why sows did not come into heat in the past was: poor feeding and management, long-term confinement without exercise, causing atrophy of the pig's reproductive organs; of course, there were also reasons such as disease or injury during farrowing and uterine inflammation. Therefore, we decided to feed the sows a large amount of green and juicy feed, feed them regularly and quantitatively, ensure two to three hours of appropriate activity every day, and strengthen environmental hygiene and prenatal and postnatal care. In particular, we have strengthened the feeding management during estrus, pregnancy, and lactation, thereby increasing the conception rate.
    II. Artificial induction of estrus: 1. Heterosexual induction method: Put boars and sows together for activities, intentionally bring them closer to promote estrus in sows. 2. Isolation of piglets to induce estrus: Isolate the piglets in a warm pigsty at night, so that the sow cannot hear the piglets' calls; return them to the sow during the day. After three to five consecutive nights of isolation, the sow will come into heat. 3. Mammary gland massage to induce estrus: Every morning after feeding, first let the sow lie down, and the person stands behind the sow and uses the palm of the hand on the sow's mammary gland skin from front to back, and from back to front, constantly massaging back and forth, each time for ten minutes. After three to ten days, estrus can be induced.
    III. Using drugs to induce estrus: In order to promote the postpartum reproductive function of sows, stimulate the sow's reproductive organs, and eliminate the postpartum estrus and delayed conception of sows, we adopted: 1. Using iodine tincture to induce estrus: We applied 2% iodine tincture around the sow's uterus (about five inches deep from the vagina) and the vaginal area. Estrus occurred three to ten days after application. 2. Taking estrus-inducing drugs: Use one tael and five mace of Angelica sinensis, one tael of Yangqi stone (roasted in fire), half a catty of motherwort, and four taels of mugwort leaves, grind them finely and mix them for oral administration. Estrus will occur two to five days after taking the medicine. 3. Using urine of pregnant animals to induce estrus: The urine of pregnant animals contains sex hormones. On March 6, 1959, we tried using the urine of sows in late pregnancy to induce estrus. Three local sows were injected, and all of them came into heat within one to three days, mated and conceived, and gave birth to piglets one after another around the end of June. The number of piglets produced was: one sow produced sixteen piglets, another produced eleven piglets, and another produced eight piglets.
    The above methods have all achieved certain results in our application. According to our experience, the combined use of artificial induction and drug induction has a greater effect.

　　怎样使母猪全配满怀
    四川剑阁初级农业技术学校
    我校有母猪十六头，过去空怀时间至少在六十天以上，严重影响了繁殖计划。一年来我们采取了一些措施，现在基本上缩短了空怀期，消灭了不发情的现象，达到两年五窝。我们的措施是：
    一、加强种畜的饲养管理：据观察，过去母猪不发情的主要原因是：饲养管理差，长期圈养不运动，引起猪的生殖器官萎缩；当然也有因疾病或产仔时受伤、子宫发炎等多方面的原因。因此，我们决定给母猪喂大量的青绿多汁饲料，定时定量喂饱，每天保证有二、三小时的适当活动，加强环境卫生和产前产后的护理。特别是加强了发情期、怀胎期、哺乳期的饲养管理工作，从而提高了受孕率。
    二、人工催情：1、异性诱导法：把公猪与母猪放在一起活动，有意使它们接近，促进母猪发情。2、隔离仔猪催情法：将仔猪夜晚隔离于温暖的猪舍内，不使母猪听到仔猪叫声；白天放回与母猪同处。接连隔离三至五夜，母猪就发情。3、乳房按摩催情法：在每天早晨喂食后，先让母猪睡倒，人站在母猪背后用手掌在母猪乳房皮肤上由前到后，由后到前，来回不断的按摩，每次摩十分钟，经过三至十天，即可引起发情。
    三、利用药物催情：为了促进母猪产后的生殖机能，刺激母猪生殖器官，消除母猪产后发情和受胎延滞的情况，我们采用了：1、用碘酒催情：我们将2％碘酒涂擦在母猪子宫周围（从阴道深入五寸左右）及阴道部分，涂擦后三至十天即发情。2、采取催情药：用当归一两五钱，阳起石一两（火煆），益母草半斤，艾叶四两，研细混合服，服后二至五天即发情。3、用孕畜尿催情：孕畜动物尿中含有性激素。我们于1959年3月6日，试用妊娠后期的母猪尿催情，注射本地母猪三头，均在一至三天内发情，配种受妊，均在6月底左右先后产仔，产仔数量是：一头产仔十六只，另一头产十一只，再一头产八只。
    以上方法，我们在应用上都收到一定的效果。根据我们体会，人工催情和药物催情综合利用效果更大。
