　　Agricultural Cooperativization Basically Achieved in Plain Areas
　　Pilot Work on Merging Small Cooperatives into Large Ones Begins and Achieves Good Results
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 18th—With the exception of high mountain regions, Albania has basically achieved agricultural cooperativization. To date, the cultivated land of agricultural cooperatives accounts for 81.6% of the country's total cultivated land, and the number of farm households joining cooperatives accounts for 70% of the country's total farm households.
　　In the coastal region of Durres, the cooperativized cultivated land already accounts for 94.7% of the region's total cultivated land, while in the plain areas of Tirana, the cooperativized cultivated land already accounts for 98.2% of all cultivated land in this area.
　　This year, in order to further expand collective agricultural production and use agricultural labor and means of production more rationally, Albania also began pilot work on merging small cooperatives into large ones. By the end of November, there were already forty-three large cooperatives merged only in the agricultural regions of Shkoder and Korca. Due to collective labor, as well as timely weeding, fertilization, and the use of machinery, many agricultural cooperatives in Albania have achieved good harvests this year. For example, the Nao Kaka Ku agricultural cooperative in the Fieri district harvested an average of 22 quintals of wheat per hectare on a large area of ​​120 hectares, while the wheat yield per hectare on a small plot of 4 hectares reached 33.8 quintals.
　　In recent years, both new and old cooperatives have fully demonstrated the superiority of cooperativization. The Podgorice agricultural cooperative in the Korca district is a new cooperative established not long ago. This cooperative's wheat production this year increased by more than 1,000 quintals compared with the original plan. At the same time, due to the large number of people and their strength, the cooperative originally planned to reclaim 52 hectares of new land, but as a result, 74 hectares of new land were reclaimed. The Shikendija agricultural cooperative, which was established in 1949, has increased the income of its members sixfold and the fixed assets of the entire cooperative more than tenfold in less than ten years.

　　阿尔巴尼亚农业社耕地面积占全国耕地面积81.6％
    平原地区基本实现农业合作化
    开始小社并大社试点工作并取得良好成绩
    新华社地拉那18日电　阿尔巴尼亚除高山地区外，已经基本上实现了农业合作化。到目前为止，农业合作社的耕地已经占全国耕地总面积的81.6％；入社的农户已经占全国农户的70％。
    滨海地区的都拉斯区合作化的耕地已经占全区耕地面积94.7％，而地拉那区的平原地带合作化的耕地已经占这一地带全部耕地面积的98.2％。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚为了进一步扩大集体农业生产和更合理地使用农业劳动力和生产资料，还开始了小社并大社的试点工作。到11月底，仅斯库台和科尔察两个农业区合并成的大社就已经有四十三个。由于进行集体劳动，以及及时除草、施肥和使用机器，今年阿尔巴尼亚有很多农业社都获得了良好的收成。例如，费里区的瑙卡卡库农业社在一百二十公顷的大面积土地上，平均每公顷收了二十二公担小麦，而在四公顷的小块土地上每公顷的小麦产量则达到三十三点八公担。
    几年来，不管是新社或者是老社都充分地显示了合作化的优越性。科尔察区的波德戈里塞农业社是成立不久的新社，这个社今年的小麦比原计划增产了一千多公担，同时由于人多力量大，这个社原计划开垦新地五十二公顷，但结果开出了七十四公顷新土地。在1949年就已成立起来的希肯迪贾农业社在不到十年的时间内社员收入增加了六倍，全社固定资金增加了十倍多。
