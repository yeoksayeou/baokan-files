“The Old Eighth Route Army's Enthusiasm is Back”
     Chen Futong Wang Xitang
    "The Old Eighth Route Army's enthusiasm is back!" If you come to the Taihang Mountains in this freezing season and see the heroic spirit of the people of southeastern Shanxi in socialist construction, you will definitely have this feeling.
    Take the Zhangze Reservoir construction site as an example. As soon as you arrive at the construction site, you will see two towering billboards with dazzling golden characters:
    Cut off the Zhang River to irrigate the fields of Shangdang;
    Fight hard this winter and spring for the happiness of generations.
    Yes, winter has already arrived, but on this construction site spanning tens of miles, countless red flags are flying, and there are endless crowds of people, carrying baskets, pushing carts, leveling earth, ramming... forming dozens of long dragons without beginning or end, which will dazzle and shock you!
    If you take a look at the construction site of the Huangnian Commune Corps, you will see groups of migrant workers busily digging earth and carrying baskets. The weather is cold, the wind is strong, the yellow dust is rolling, and the sand is blowing in their faces. Although everyone's face is covered with a thick layer of yellow earth, like a mud figure, they are all smiling, talking and singing, their enthusiasm is so high!
    People will definitely tell you about the deeds of Li Zenglan, an old Eighth Route Army soldier: "You said Zenglan? No need to say anything, he's great! When fighting the Japanese devils, he cleverly captured Laoding Mountain, destroyed Shenquan Gully, and captured thirty devils alive, that energy is back again! Look, that flatbed cart like an arrow is pulled by him!"
    He always says:
    "It's nothing, comrades, don't be surprised. This is much better than fighting guerrillas in the Taihang Mountains in those years, rolling in the ice and crawling in the snow, rushing a hundred or two hundred li in one dark night! As long as the reservoir can be completed a day earlier, it's nothing for me to put in more effort, endure more hardship, and run a few more steps!"
    On the construction site of the Nanchui Commune Corps, there is a group of mobile women wearing red and green, which is the most eye-catching. Take Wang Linying, a member of the Communist Youth League, for example. This gentle girl is really good at work. In the whistling north wind, she only wears a pink shirt and carries a load of hundreds of kilograms, always leaving the young men far behind.
    If you come to the construction site at dusk, you will see the beautiful scenery of the construction site bathed in the afterglow of the setting sun. Before the night has even drawn its black curtain, tens of thousands of lights are lit on the construction site. The migrant workers on the night shift are heading to the construction site with full spirits; the people on the day shift are resting happily, some singing ditties, some playing poker, and some talking excitedly about the competition. The flying north wind aroused people's soaring enthusiasm, and the cold night on the construction site also became hot! Look, how happily the comrades erecting power poles under the spotlights are working! More than 120 linesmen are digging holes, erecting poles, and laying lines. You may not know the old electrician climbing on the power pole more than eight meters high! He is Liu Yaowen, the Deputy Mayor of Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, and the General Commander of the Zhangze Reservoir Project. He is not only an excellent commander but also a heroic combatant.
    Ah, the Zhangze Reservoir construction site with the chilling wind, here are blooming heroic flowers everywhere! During the anti-Japanese war, the heroic Taihang people cultivated the revolutionary buds with their own blood; today, during the period of socialist construction, they are irrigating the tree of happiness with endless sweat! If you come to this heroic construction site in person, a magnificent picture of labor will make your blood boil! A great, rich, and happy vision will unfold before your eyes. Only when you face this magnificent scene of socialist construction can you more deeply appreciate the profound meaning of the saying "the enthusiasm of the old Eighth Route Army is back."

    “老八路的干劲又来了”
     陈福同　王喜堂
    “老八路的干劲又来了！”你要是在这数九隆冬的严寒季节来到太行山，见到英雄的晋东南人民在社会主义建设中的磅礴气势的时候，你一定会有这样的感觉。
    就说漳泽水库工地上的情景吧。一到工地，你就会看到两座高耸入云的标语牌，黄灿灿的金字耀眼夺目：
    斩断漳河水，灌溉上党田；
    大战一冬春，幸福万万年。
    是的，时间已经进入了严冬，可是在这方圆数十里的工地上，却飘扬着数不尽的红旗，满布着望不到头的人群，抬筐的、推车的、平土的、打夯的……排开了数十条不见头尾的长龙，真叫你眼花缭乱，惊心动魄！
    你到黄碾公社兵团工地上一瞧，成群结队的民工正忙忙碌碌地在掘土挑筐。天又冷，风又急，黄尘滚滚，风砂扑面，尽管每个人脸上都蒙上了一层厚厚的黄土，活像个泥人，但他们喜笑颜开，有说有唱，干劲是那么足，情绪是那么高！
    人们准会这样告诉你关于老八路李增兰的事迹：“你说增兰吗？没话说，好样的！打日本鬼子时候，智取老顶山，大破神泉沟，活捉三十个鬼子的劲头又来了！你瞧，那辆像脱弦的箭一样的平车，就是他拉的！”
    他总是说：
    “没什么，同志们，不要大惊小怪的。这比起当年太行山上打游击，冰里滚，雪里爬，一黑夜赶上一二百里地，可强得多咧！只要水库能早一天修成，我多出些力气，多吃些苦，多跑几步路，又算得了什么！”
    在南垂公社兵团工地上，有一群流动着的穿红着绿的妇女，最引人注目。就说共青团员王林英吧，这个秉性温柔的姑娘，干起活来却着实不赖。呼呼的北风里也只穿一件粉红色的单衫，担个百把来斤的担子，总把小伙子们甩得老远。
    你要是在黄昏时分来到工地，你会看到浴着夕阳余辉的工地美景。夜晚还没赶上拉开它黑色的帷幕，工地上就亮起了万盏灯火。夜班的民工们精神饱满地走向工地；白班的人们呢，在愉快地休息，有的唱小曲，有的玩扑克，有的在眉飞色舞说着竞赛的事。飞滚的北风激起了人们冲天的干劲，寒冷的工地之夜也变得热气腾腾！你瞧，探照灯下竖立电线杆的同志们干得多欢！一百二十多名架线工，挖坑的挖坑，竖杆的竖杆，放线的放线。你可能不认识爬在八米多高的电线杆上的老电工吧！他就是山西省长治市副市长、漳泽水库工程的总指挥刘耀文。他不但是出色的指挥员，还是英勇的战斗员呢。
    啊，寒风瑟瑟的漳泽水库工地，这里遍开着英雄的花朵！英雄的太行人民在战火纷飞的抗日战争时期，以自己的鲜血培育了革命的花蕾；今天，在社会主义建设时期，又以流不尽的汗水，灌溉着幸福的大树！你要是亲自来到这英雄的工地，一幅雄伟壮丽的劳动画面，将使你热血沸腾！一个伟大、富饶、幸福的远景，将在你眼前展现。也只有当你面临着这社会主义建设的宏伟场景，你才能更深切地体会到“老八路的干劲又来了”这句话的深刻含义。
