What is needed should be reformed.

　　Industrial support for agriculture must precede the agricultural season; this is a very important experience.

　　Agricultural production is seasonal. Each season's production requires different agricultural tools and implements. Preparing early according to needs, producing what is needed, is not only necessary for agricultural production, but also beneficial for the planning of industrial production. Early arrangements are beneficial.

　　In addition to closely grasping seasonality, industrial support for agriculture must also closely grasp the central link of technological transformation. At present, the urgent need to be solved in agricultural production is the technological transformation of agricultural production. Taking production tools as an example, industrial departments should not only supply a sufficient quantity of products, but more importantly, vigorously improve products and provide high-efficiency production tools. To achieve this, industrial departments need to establish organizations that combine leadership, technical workers, and farmers, study and experiment together with farmers according to actual needs, repeatedly appraise and improve products, so that the reformed tools are both highly efficient and practical. For example, a wooden crane can replace dozens of laborers and increase work efficiency by more than seventy times, which is worth popularizing.

　　When the wheat was not yet ripe, the industrial departments of the Xiangyang Special District in Hubei Province rushed to manufacture, repair, and reform summer harvesting tools. When agriculture was still fighting drought, in addition to rushing to manufacture drought-fighting tools, they organized forces to rush to manufacture and reform winter sowing deep plows. Planning ahead, when winter water conservancy projects began, they rushed to manufacture more than 4 million pieces of water conservancy equipment and tools, and sent more than 1,000 mobile repair teams to support water conservancy construction. This proactive approach of staying ahead of the agricultural season and promoting agricultural technology transformation is worth advocating.

    需要什么就改革什么
    工业支援农业要赶在农业季节的前面，是一条十分重要的经验。
    农业生产是有季节性的，每个季节的生产所需要的农具、工具，各有不同，根据需要早作准备，做到需要什么生产什么，这不仅对农业生产十分必要，对于工业的生产计划来说，早作安排也是有好处的。
    工业支援农业，除了紧紧抓住季节性以外，还要紧紧抓住技术改造这个中心环节。当前，农业生产上迫切需要解决的是农业生产的技术改造问题，拿生产工具来说，工业部门不仅要供应足够的产品数量，更重要的是大力改进产品，提供高效率的生产工具。要做到这一点，需要工业部门建立领导、技术工人和农民三结合的组织，根据实际需要，和农民一起研究试验，反复鉴定，改进产品，使改革以后的工具，效率既高而又切合实用。譬如说一台木制起重机，能顶上几十个劳动力，可以提高工效七十多倍，这就值得推广。
    湖北襄阳专区工业部门当麦子还没有成熟的时候，就赶制、修配、改革夏收工具；农业还在抗旱的时候，他们除了赶制抗旱工具以外，就组织力量赶制和改革冬播深耕犁。未雨绸缪，在冬季水利工程开始的时候，他们又赶制水利设备和工具四百多万件，派出了一千多个工地巡回修理组，支援水利建设。这种积极赶在农时前面、促进农业技术改造的做法，值得提倡。
