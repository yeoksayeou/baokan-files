　　The Communist Party's Leadership is Invincible, The People's Commune's Power is Earth-shattering
　　Hundreds of Millions of Heroic Peasants Achieve Great Victory in Fighting Disasters and Guarantee Production and Bumper Harvests
　　This year, natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, and pests were extremely severe, making it the most disaster-stricken year for agriculture in our country since liberation. The disaster area reached over 600 million mu; among them, the drought extended to 20 provinces and regions, which had not been seen for decades. However, the whole party and the entire people exerted their utmost effort, giving full play to the superiority of the People's Commune, and overcame the disasters. Most areas increased grain production, and a great bumper harvest of cotton was achieved.

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: A Xinhua News Agency reporter's commentary: The news of bumper harvests from rural areas across the country shows that China's People's Communes, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, have achieved a brilliant victory in this year's magnificent struggle against severe droughts and other natural disasters.

This year is the year with the most severe agricultural disasters in our country since liberation. Drought and natural disasters such as floods, wind, and pests were extremely serious, with disaster areas reaching over 600 million mu. This year's drought was unseen for decades. This was truly a severe test for the newly established rural People's Communes. However, the whole party and the entire people exerted their utmost effort, giving full play to the superiority of the People's Commune, overcoming the disasters, winning bumper harvests, realizing the heroic slogan of "No drought in the sky, guaranteed bumper harvest without rain," and realizing the continued leap forward in agricultural production in our country.

This year, our country experienced many natural disasters, with a large affected area and a long duration. Moreover, disasters occurred repeatedly throughout the year, with some places experiencing one disaster after another without interruption. The situation of many disasters, large disasters, long duration, and repeated occurrences is rare in history. Taking the most serious drought this year as an example, the country suffered from drought on about 500 million mu of farmland during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, affecting 20 provinces and regions. Before June, the spring drought in Hebei, Inner Mongolia, northern Shaanxi, and the three northeastern provinces was very serious. In western Jilin Province and the Changbai Mountain area in the south, and in western Liaoning Province and the Liaodong Peninsula in the south, most small rivers dried up, the Songhua River's water source was on the verge of depletion, and the Fengman Reservoir lacked water for power generation. During June, July, August, and September, the summer drought that occurred in the main agricultural areas of the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin in central China was unprecedented in many areas for seventy years, and it occurred during the season when crops needed the most water. The total rainfall from July to October in the provinces most severely affected by drought, such as Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu (central), Shaanxi (central and southern), Hunan (northern), Sichuan (eastern), and Shanxi (southern), was generally only about 30% to 65% of the normal rainfall during the same period, and some places even had no rain for more than 100 days. During July and August, the temperature in the area south of the Yellow River and in the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River and the Yangtze River remained at 38 to 40 degrees Celsius. In late July, the daily evaporation near Nanjing increased by 80% compared to the same period last year. In the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, in some severely drought-stricken areas of the four special districts of Wanxian, Daxian, Mianyang, and Jiangjin in Sichuan Province, many small rivers also dried up. In Hubei Province, more than 80% of the ponds and reservoirs dried up by late July, and after mid-August, almost all small river water sources were exhausted. In the swampy area of Gong'an County, more than 190 of the 250 larger lakes dried up. The water level in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River was very low, and only 50 of the 121 sluices and 13 of the 160 open outlets along the river could release water. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the lower reaches of the Huai River experienced the same low water levels as in the driest years in history. In the mountainous areas of Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, more than 149,000 ponds and reservoirs dried up, and more than 4 million mu of rice fields in the province were affected by drought, of which 720,000 mu were so dry that they turned white and cracked. In Guangshan County, Henan, in the upper reaches of the Huai River, more than 16,000 pits, ponds, and small reservoirs were completely dry. In October, serious autumn droughts occurred again in Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and vast areas of South China. In many places, the summer drought and the autumn drought were almost continuous, and the drought in some parts of South China has only recently eased.

Early in the season, heavy rain and floods occurred in South China. In June, the Dongjiang River basin in Guangdong experienced a major flood that occurs only once in a century. When the central region suffered a severe drought in the summer, North China, along the Great Wall, experienced incessant heavy rain. The floods and waterlogging in southern Inner Mongolia, Hebei, northern Shanxi, and Suizhong, Liaoning, both inside and outside the Great Wall, also exceeded the records of the past few decades. The rainfall in the Beijing area from July to October exceeded twice the normal annual rainfall, making it the year with the most rainfall since records began in 1840. This year, pest infestations were severe in drought-stricken areas. Locusts in Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces, and rice borers in Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces were the most damaging. Since the beginning of summer, of the five typhoons that landed in the coastal areas of southeastern China, two had winds of level 12, which is a devastating disaster, with Fuzhou and Xiamen being the most severely affected. In addition, many places in Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Beijing suffered hailstorms in the spring and summer.

Before liberation, China was prone to disasters. At that time, even if the disasters were not large, the damage caused was astonishing. In 1942, Henan only had about fifty days of less rain, with a drought-affected area of more than 50 million mu. The drought was not as severe as this year, but at that time, the land was barren for miles, there was no harvest, more than 10 million people left their homes, sold their children, and 3 million people died of starvation. In 1945, Hunan only had 52 days of drought, and 4 million people died of hunger and disease.

In contrast to the past, this year's disasters in our country were rare in history, but agriculture still achieved a bumper harvest. The national grain production still increased compared to last year, and the cotton harvest was even better than the grain harvest, which was a major bumper harvest. According to preliminary statistics, in Hubei Province, which was the most severely affected by drought, of the more than 54 million mu of major autumn crops that were severely affected by drought, 25 million mu experienced reduced production due to the disaster (of which 15 million mu had basically no harvest, calculated by replanted area), and the remaining nearly 30 million mu all had bumper harvests. In Henan Province, which had the largest drought-affected area, nearly 100 million mu of drought-affected crops achieved "no drought in the sky," and the total output of grain and cotton still exceeded last year's. In Hunan Province, most counties and cities, except for eight or nine, had bumper harvests of double-cropping late rice. In addition, all provinces and regions severely affected by disasters, such as Anhui, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, had increased production compared to last year in most or the vast majority of areas, and some areas had the same output as the great leap forward in production last year. Only a small part or individual counties experienced varying degrees of reduced production compared to last year because they were particularly severely affected by disasters, although they had made great efforts to save the situation. Tang Zhangtao, an 82-year-old commune member of the Tangdukou Commune in Shaoyang County, Hunan Province, vividly summarized the two different major drought years in the old and new societies: "In the year of Jihai before liberation (1899), there was a drought for 80 days, and we ate bark and grass roots and starved to death; in the year of Jihai after communization (1959), there was a drought for 130 days, with a yield of 780 jin per mu, and grain piles were everywhere." As for the Dongjiang River basin in Guangdong, which was the most severely affected by floods, more than 5 million mu of early rice experienced varying degrees of reduced production this year, and more than 1 million mu were lost due to the disaster, but the output of late rice all increased compared to last year. In the Tangshan area of Hebei, which was the most severely affected by waterlogging in the north, the goal of "no reduction in production in severely affected areas and guaranteed bumper harvest in lightly affected areas" was also achieved.

What strength did the Chinese people rely on to overcome such a rare major disaster? Hubei farmers answered well: "This year, we are eating the Communist Party's food and benefiting from the light of the People's Commune." In the severe struggle against disasters, especially against drought, the Party is the leader, organizer, and inspirer of the masses. As soon as the disaster situation emerged in the disaster-stricken areas, under the leadership of the Party, command headquarters for disaster relief were established at all levels, and a large army of labor for disaster relief was organized. Party committee secretaries at all levels led the vast number of cadres to the front line. In Hubei Province alone, more than 100,000 cadres went deep into the fields and worked with the masses to fight the drought. When the drought first occurred in Feicheng County, Shandong, some cadres and the masses had the idea of relying on the sky for rain. The Party organization put forward the slogan of "Man will conquer nature, don't wait for rain"; when the drought was severe and a few people had difficulties and pessimism about fighting the drought, the Party organization criticized this emotion among the cadres, mobilized the masses to speak freely, organized visits to advanced communes and teams in fighting the drought, and established a firm confidence in overcoming the drought. Many areas also put forward the battle slogans of "Fighting the drought until the sky bows its head" and "Guaranteeing production in severely affected areas and increasing production in lightly affected areas." After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the call to oppose right-leaning, boost morale, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, the people in various places became more motivated and further launched a massive movement to fight disasters, guarantee bumper harvests, and increase production. The five-supplement movement carried out in the disaster areas of Shanxi Province—supplementing dry land with watered land, supplementing early autumn with late autumn, supplementing grain with vegetables, supplementing early peaches with late peaches, and supplementing agriculture with sideline occupations—greatly reduced the losses caused by this year's disasters in the region. The Party and the state also organized forces from all aspects to support the disaster relief efforts with materials and labor.

The strength to overcome this year's extraordinary disaster mainly came from the large and public People's Commune and the communist large-scale collaboration of the People's Commune. The commune is large and has more accumulation. The famous Chaya Mountain People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan, bought 12 diesel engines and 5 locomobiles to pump water for irrigation during this year's drought. The Jiaogang Lake Commune in Fengtai County, Anhui, had 700 mu of upland rice affected by drought and no water for irrigation this year. The commune organized a large labor force and, in five days, moved all 700 mu of rice to the lake beach of another production team ten miles away. When floods raged in the Dongjiang River in Guangdong this year, two large dikes protecting more than 10,000 mu of farmland in the Shitan People's Commune of Zengcheng were severely damaged, and six of the seven small and medium-sized dikes were damaged. To repair these water conservancy projects, 650,000 cubic meters of earthwork were needed, and 280,000 cubic meters of earthwork had to be completed in the short period of more than 20 days before the great heat to ensure the transplanting of late rice. The commune unified the arrangement of labor and quickly drew 5,000 to 6,000 people from 29 production brigades to rush to repair the dikes, and quickly and smoothly completed this arduous task. In the fight against drought, many counties and communes in Guangxi extensively carried out large-scale cooperation and large-scale support under the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. They divided the collaboration areas according to drought conditions, water sources, and labor, breaking through the boundaries of teams, communes, and even counties, and jointly fought drought and prevented drought. Xing'an and Laibin counties organized more than 1,000 drought-fighting commando teams to support the production teams that were severely affected by drought and lacked labor. The 140,000 mu of autumn seedlings in the five Guo and Dabao Head communes in the suburbs of Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, were severely affected by drought. The neighboring Changzi Town and Nan Cheng communes immediately drew more than 400 people, 100 head of cattle, and more than 100 waterwheels and irrigation machines to support the fight against drought. More than 30 wells and springs were drilled in five days, and the drought-affected autumn seedlings were watered, so that the autumn seedlings quickly turned from yellow to green. This year, some areas have also experienced reduced production due to severe disasters. However, People's Communes not only operate agriculture, but also have commune-run industries, and the scale of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery is also large, and the income is also high. Lingqiu County, Shanxi Province, reduced grain production by about 4 million jin this year, but the income of the county's People's Communes from mining, collecting mountain goods, operating weaving, transportation, and other sideline occupations has greatly increased this year. Therefore, the average income per farmer in the county still increased by 27% compared to last year. All of this would not be possible without the People's Communes. Even the equipment used for disaster relief in various places this year, in addition to a part supplied by the state, was manufactured by the commune factories themselves.

Water conservancy projects have also played a huge role in this year's fight against drought and waterlogging. Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, and Beijing, which suffered serious waterlogging disasters this year, have stored more than 11.6 billion cubic meters of floodwater (of which the new projects built since the Great Leap Forward stored more than 6.9 billion cubic meters) due to the large, medium, and small water conservancy projects built since liberation, greatly reducing the flood peaks downstream of the reservoirs and mitigating the damage caused by floods. Most of the drought-affected farmland in the country was timely irrigated this year. This summer, the Yellow River irrigation projects downstream of the Yellow River, west from the Taihang Mountains and east to Weishan Lake, and more than 200 siphon projects released water at the same time, ensuring the timely irrigation of 20 million mu of farmland along the river in Henan and Shandong provinces. The Huaihe River network project in northern Anhui also showed great power in the fight against drought, storing 1.5 billion cubic meters more water than last year, greatly enhancing its drought resistance. The Meishan, Baisha, and Foziling reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Huaihe River irrigated a total of more than 1.8 million mu of land this year in the fight against drought. The watermelon vine-style water conservancy irrigation project in the Xiangyang area of Hubei Province diverted and stored 2 billion cubic meters of water this summer, ensuring water use for more than 4.9 million mu of rice fields in the entire area. Many provinces also rushed to build and renovate many large and small water conservancy projects in the fight against drought.

Now, the people in a few areas in South China where the drought has not been completely lifted are still continuing to fight the drought. In addition to strengthening the field management of various overwintering crops, other areas that have suffered serious natural disasters and reduced production this year are focusing on diversified operations to increase income, practicing strict economy, and preparing to overcome the difficulties.

Encouraged by the victory in the fight against disasters, a winter production upsurge centered on water conservancy construction, pig raising, and fertilizer accumulation has recently formed in rural areas across the country. Winter cultivation, winter modification (soil improvement), and winter management (field management) are also in full swing. The vast number of commune members are working hard for the continued leap forward in agriculture next year. (Attached picture)

This summer, the Liulang Commune in Jiangning County, Jiangsu, was threatened by drought. Under the slogan of "Fight the drought until the sky bows its head and guarantee seedlings until grain enters the granary," the commune members rested people but not carts, using water carts to go up the mountain to irrigate the fields.

　　共产党的领导无往不胜　人民公社的威力气吞山河
　　亿万英雄农民抗灾大胜利保产保丰收
    今年旱、水、风、虫等自然灾害十分严重，是解放以来我国农业受灾最严重的一年，受灾面积共达六亿多亩；其中旱灾延及二十个省区，是几十年来没有见过的。但是全党全民鼓足干劲，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，战胜了灾害，绝大部分地区粮食增产，棉花大丰收。
    新华社22日讯　新华社记者述评：各地农村传来的丰收消息表明：我国人民公社在各级党委领导下，今年同严重的干旱等自然灾害进行的一场气壮山河的搏斗，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    今年是解放以来我国农业受灾最重的一年，旱灾和水、风、虫等自然灾害都十分严重，受灾面积共达六亿多亩。今年的旱灾是几十年没有见过的。这对新成立的农村人民公社真是一次严重的考验。但是全党全民鼓足干劲，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，战胜了灾害，夺得了丰收，实现了“天旱地不旱，无雨保丰收”的豪迈口号，实现了我国农业生产的继续跃进。
    今年我国自然灾害很多，受灾面积很大，灾情持续的时间很久，而且一年来灾害反复发生，有些地方几乎是一个灾紧接着一个灾，没有间断。灾多、灾大、持久、反复的情况，这在历史上是少有的。就今年最严重的旱灾说，今年春、夏、秋三季，全国前后受旱农田就达五亿亩左右，延及二十个省区。6月以前，河北、内蒙古、陕西北部和东北三省的春旱就很严重。吉林省西部和南部长白山一带、辽宁省西部和南部辽东半岛都旱得大部分小河断流，松花江水源濒于枯竭，丰满水库缺水发电。6、7、8、9几个月，我国中部黄河流域和长江流域主要农业区所发生的夏旱，很多地区是七十年来所没有的，而且发生在农作物生长最需水的季节。受旱最重的湖北、河南、山东、安徽、江苏（中部）、陕西（中、南部）、湖南（北部）、四川（东部）、山西（南部）等省7至10月的降雨总量，一般都只有常年同期雨量的30％到65％左右，有些地方甚至一百多天无雨。7、8月间，黄河以南淮河和长江中下游地区的气温一直保持摄氏三十八度到四十度。7月下旬南京附近的日蒸发量比去年同期增加了80％。长江上游四川省万县、达县、绵阳、江津四个专区的部分干旱严重地区，也旱得许多小河断流。湖北全省塘堰到7月下旬就干涸了80％以上，8月中旬以后，小河水源也几乎全部枯竭，沼泽地区公安县的二百五十多处较大的湖泊干了一百九十多处。长江中游水位很低，沿江一百二十一个闸和一百六十个明口，能放水的只有五十个闸和十三个明口。长江下游和淮河下游都出现与历史上最旱年相同的枯水位。江苏省镇江、扬州、南京山区的塘堰干了十四万九千多个，全省受旱的稻田四百多万亩，其中有七十二万亩干得发白龟裂。淮河上游河南光山县有一万六千多处坑塘和小型水库完全干枯。10月，河南、安徽、湖北和华南广大地区又发生了严重的秋旱，许多地方夏旱秋旱几乎是延续下来的，而华南部分地区的旱情最近才有缓和。
    暴雨和洪水灾害早期发生在华南，6月间广东东江流域发生了百年一遇的大水。而当夏季中部地区发生大旱的时候，华北长城一线却又暴雨不止。长城内外的内蒙古南部、河北、山西北部、辽宁绥中等地的水灾涝灾同样超过了几十年来的纪录。北京地区7至10月的降雨量超出了平常全年雨量的一倍，为1840年有记录以来雨量最多的一年。受旱地区，今年虫害都很严重。以山东、河南、安徽等省的蝗虫和四川、湖南、江苏、浙江等省的水稻螟虫为害最重。入夏以来，在我国东南沿海地区登陆的五次台风中，有两次风力达到十二级，这是一种带有毁灭性的灾害，福州、厦门一线受灾最重。此外，河北、山西、陕西、河南、山东和北京等省市的很多地方，春夏间还遭受过雹灾的袭击。
    解放前中国是多灾的。那时候即使灾情不大，所造成的灾害也是惊人的。1942年，河南仅五十天左右少雨，受旱面积五千多万亩，旱情没有今年重，但当时，赤地千里，颗粒无收，一千多万人背井离乡，卖儿卖女，饿死了三百万人。1945年，湖南全省只旱了五十二天，死于饥饿病疫的就有四百万人。
    同过去的情况相反，今年我国灾情是历史上少有的，农业却仍然取得了丰收。全国粮食比去年仍然增产了，棉花的收成比粮食还要好，是一次很大的丰收。受灾最重的湖北省，据初步统计，受旱严重的五千四百多万亩大秋作物中，因灾减产的有二千五百万亩（其中按复种面积计算，基本无收的有一千五百万亩），其余的近三千万亩全部丰收。受旱面积最大的河南省，在一百天基本无雨的情况下，近一亿亩受旱农作物作到了“天旱地不旱”，粮棉总产量仍然超过了去年。湖南省双季晚稻除八、九个县市外，其他大部分县市都丰收。此外所有受灾严重的省区，如安徽、山东、江苏、陕西、四川等省都是大部分或者绝大部分地区比去年增了产，一部分地区与去年大跃进的产量相等，只有小部分或者个别县因受灾特重，虽然经过大力挽救，仍然不同程度地比去年减了产。湖南省邵阳县塘渡口公社八十二岁的社员唐章陶生动地总结了新旧社会两个不同的大旱年说：“解放前的己亥年（1899年）天旱八十天，吃树皮草根饿断肠；公社化后的己亥年（1959年），大旱一百三十天，亩产七百八十斤，到处谷子堆满仓。”至于广东水灾最重的东江流域，今年早稻有五百多万亩有不同程度的减产，有一百多万亩因灾失收，但晚稻的产量都比去年增产。北方受涝最重的河北唐山地区，也实现了“重灾不减产，轻灾保丰收”。
    中国人民凭什么力量战胜了这样一次少有的大灾？湖北农民回答得好：“今年吃的是共产党的饭，沾的是人民公社的光。”在抗灾特别是抗旱的严重斗争中，党是群众的领导者、组织者和鼓舞者。受灾地区灾情刚一露头，在党的领导下就建立了各级抗灾的指挥部，组织了抗灾的劳动大军。各级党委书记都率领广大干部亲临前线。仅湖北省就有十多万干部深入田间和群众一道抗旱。山东肥城县在旱情初发生时，部分干部和群众，有靠天等雨思想，党组织就提出了“人定胜天、不要等雨”的口号；当旱情严重，少数群众对抗旱产生畏难和悲观情绪，党组织在干部中批判了这种情绪，发动群众鸣放，组织参观抗旱先进的社队，树立了战胜干旱的坚定信心。不少地区还提出了“抗旱抗到天低头”、“重灾保产、轻灾增产”的战斗口号。党的八届八中全会的反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的号召发出后，各地人民干劲更足，进一步掀起了一个声势浩大的抗灾保丰收的超产运动。山西省灾区开展的五补运动：旱地丢了水地补，早秋丢了晚秋补，粮食丢了蔬菜补，伏桃丢了秋桃补，农业丢了副业补，就大大减轻了这个地区今年受灾的损失。党和国家还组织各方面的力量，以物资，劳力等支援了抗灾斗争。
    能够战胜今年特大灾害的力量，主要来自又大又公的人民公社，来自人民公社的共产主义大协作。公社大，积累多，河南著名的遂平县嵖岈山人民公社在今年抗旱中就买了十二部柴油机和五部锅驼机，抽水灌田。安徽凤台县焦岗湖公社今年有七百多亩岗地水稻受旱无水灌溉，公社就组织了劳动大军，以五天时间，把七百多亩水稻全部移到了十里以外另一个生产队的湖滩地上。今年广东东江洪水泛滥时，增城石滩人民公社两条保护一万多亩农田的大堤围遭到极大破坏、七条中小堤围坏了六条。要修复这些水利工程需要做六十五万土方，而且必须在大暑以前的短短二十多天中做完二十八万土方，才能保证晚稻的插秧工作。这个公社统一安排劳力，迅速从二十九个生产大队抽出五、六千人突击修堤，很快就顺利完成了这项艰巨任务。在抗旱中，广西的许多县、公社在互助互利的原则下，广泛开展了大协作、大支援，他们根据旱情、水源、劳力情况，划分协作区，打破队界、社界以至县界，联合抗旱防旱，兴安、来宾两县组织了一千多个抗旱突击队，支援了受旱严重、劳力不足的生产队。山西长治市郊区的五郭、大堡头等四个公社有十四万亩秋苗受旱严重，邻近的长子镇、南呈等公社立即抽出四百多人、一百头耕畜，一百多部水车和灌溉机械前往支援抗旱，在五天内就打井挖泉三十多处，车水浇灌受旱秋苗，使秋苗迅速由黄转青。今年也有一些地区灾重减产。但是人民公社不仅经营农业，还有社办工业，林、牧、副、渔多种经营的规模也大，收入也多。山西灵丘县今年受灾粮食减产四百万斤左右，但是，全县人民公社今年开矿、采山货、经营编织、运输等副业的收入大大增加，因而全县农民每人平均收入仍比去年增加了27％。所有这些，不是人民公社都办不到。甚至今年各地抗灾所用的器材，除一部分由国家供应的外，也都是由公社工厂自己制造的。
    水利工程对今年抗旱抗涝也发挥了巨大的作用。今年遭到严重水涝灾害的河北、内蒙古、辽宁和北京，由于有解放以来兴修的大量大、中、小水利工程，拦蓄洪水一百一十六亿多立方米（其中大跃进以来所修的新工程蓄水达六十九亿多立方米），大大削减了水库下游的洪峰，减轻了洪水为害。全国大部分受旱农田今年都及时得到了浇灌。今年伏期黄河下游西起太行山、东到微山湖十多处引黄灌溉工程，和二百多处虹吸管工程同时放水，保证了河南、山东等省两千万亩沿河农田的及时浇灌。淮北河网化工程在抗旱中也大显威力，比去年多蓄了十五亿立方米水，大大增强了抗旱能力。淮河上游的梅山、白沙、佛子岭等水库，今年在抗旱中共浇地一百八十多万亩。湖北省襄阳地区的西瓜秧式的水利灌溉工程今夏引蓄水量达到二十亿立方米，保证了全区四百九十多万亩稻田用水。许多省在抗旱中还突击新修、整修了许多大小水利工程。
    现在，华南少数旱情还未完全解除地区的人民还在继续进行抗旱斗争。其他今年遭受严重自然灾害减了产的地区，除加强各种越冬作物田间管理外，正大抓多种经营，增加收入，并厉行节约，准备渡荒。
    全国农村在抗灾胜利的鼓舞下，最近以兴修水利、养猪积肥为中心的冬季生产高潮已经形成，冬耕、冬改（改良土壤）、冬管（田间管理）等工作，也都已热火朝天地开展起来，广大社员正为明年农业继续跃进而努力。（附图片）
