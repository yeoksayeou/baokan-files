　　Machine Planting of Rice: Fast and Bountiful Harvest
    Chahayang Farm Rice Yield Sets New Record for Northernmost Regions

    (Our report) The six thousand workers of the state-owned Chahayang Farm, located in the northernmost part of the country, went all out, giving full play to the superior efficiency of agricultural machinery, and seized time from nature, enabling rice, which requires a growing period of one hundred and twenty days, to mature and achieve a bumper harvest within the one hundred and ten-day frost-free period. This year, the 150,000 mu of rice planted by the Chahayang Farm achieved an average yield of 420 jin per mu. Among them, 3,450 mu of rice achieved an average yield of 800 to 1,400 jin per mu, setting a new record for large-scale high-yield rice production in the northernmost region of the country.

    Chahayang Farm manages 315,000 mu of land, focusing on rice production and is currently the largest rice paddy farm in the country. The Chahayang Farm is equipped with a large number of agricultural machinery, with 85% of the land cultivated using mechanical tools, which is an important factor in the rice's ability to race against time and win. The farm adopted a machine "dry direct seeding" method for planting rice, that is, seeding first and then irrigating. Machine planting of rice is like planting wheat. Once the sowing season arrives, groups of giant tractors pull seeders into the fields. Each tractor pulls five to six seeders, and after running back and forth across the flat and wide rice paddies, 150 mu of rice are planted. One day, one or two thousand mu can be planted. After seeding and compacting the rice fields, tractors pull ridging machines created by farm workers to build field ridges. After the rice matures, the water is drained, and the fields are dried. Combine harvesters are then used to harvest, threshing as they cut, and the rice fields become threshing grounds. Chahayang Farm has an average of only one laborer for every fifty mu of cultivated land. However, powerful agricultural machinery ensures that a large amount of field work is completed effectively in a short period of time.

    After seeding and ridging are completed, the rice fields are irrigated. Chahayang Farm uses gravity irrigation, requiring neither human power nor water pumps, with the annual water cost for one mu of rice paddy being only a few jiao. The large sluice gate at the head of the canal cuts off the tributary of the Nen River, and a large Taiping Lake was built near the head of the canal to prevent both flooding and drought, ensuring the water supply for the rice fields. The amount of water controlled by each large gate can irrigate a total of 4.5 million mu of land, making it one of the four major irrigation areas in Northeast China. Chahayang Farm is located at the foot of the Greater Khingan Mountains, and the entire farm forms a gentle slope that is high in the north and low in the south. When the gate is opened, the water flows along the slope through the canals into the rice fields. Numerous additional water conservancy projects have been established on the canals to ensure smooth gravity irrigation. One type is called the cross bridge, a section of canal made of cement with a bridge hole underneath. Two streams of water, one above and one below, cross east-west and north-south, without affecting each other. The upper stream draws river water to irrigate the rice fields, and the lower stream drains water into the river. At Chahayang Farm, the water depth in each rice paddy, regardless of the terrain, is always maintained between two and a half and three and six tenths of an inch.

    The workers of Chahayang Farm have resourceful ways to overcome unfavorable natural conditions. Before the rice seeds are planted, they are soaked in warm water to promote germination, so that the seed embryos have already begun to sprout when the seeds are planted. As a result, the growing period of the rice in the fields is shortened by about ten days compared to the original time. Specially lengthened and widened canals allow the flowing water to be exposed to the sun for a longer period of time before it flows into the rice fields, which increases the water temperature. When the rice turns yellow and ripens, watering is stopped to ensure a higher ground temperature and promote early ripening of the rice. Before the rice matures, the workers pay attention to the weather day and night. Some production teams measure the temperature every hour. When the temperature drops sharply, they light fires to create smoke on the edges of the low-lying rice fields to protect the rice from frost damage. (Liu Yingbin, Zhang Tiankong)

　　机器种水稻  又快又丰收
    查哈阳农场水稻产量创最北地区新纪录
    本报讯　地处全国最北部的国营查哈阳农场，六千名职工鼓足干劲，充分发挥机械农具的优越效能，从大自然手里夺取时间，使生育期需要一百二十天的水稻在一百一十天的无霜期内成熟而且丰收。今年查哈阳农场种植的十五万亩水稻，平均亩产四百二十斤。其中有三千四百五十亩水稻，平均亩产八百斤到一千四百斤，创造了全国最北地区大面积水稻高产的新纪录。
    查哈阳农场经营土地三十一万五千亩，以水稻生产为主，是目前全国最大的水田农场。查哈阳农场配备有大量的机械农具，85％的土地使用机械农具耕种，这是这里水稻生育和时间赛跑能够取胜的重要因素。农场采取机器“旱直播”种水稻的办法，即先播种，后灌水。机器种水稻就像种小麦一样。播种期一到，成群的巨型拖拉机拉着播种机开入田间。每台拖拉机拉上五个到六个播种机，在平坦广阔的稻田上奔驰一个来回，就种好一百五十亩水稻，一天可以种一两千亩。在种完压镇好的稻田上，拖拉机又拉来农场职工创造的筑埂机打田埂。水稻成熟以后，撤水晒田，联合收割机开来收割，边割边打，稻田又成了脱谷场。查哈阳农场平均每五十亩耕地才有一个劳动力，但是，威力强大的农业机器，保证了大量的田间工作量在短时间有效地完成。
    播种、筑埂完毕以后，稻田才灌水。查哈阳农场都是采取自流灌溉，既不用人戽也不用抽水机，一亩水田一年用水耗费只要几角钱。渠首的大水闸，截断了嫩江支流，并在渠首附近修建了大型的太平湖，使水多不涝，水少不旱，保证了稻田的供水；各个大闸门控制的水量，共可以灌溉四百五十万亩土地，是东北四大灌区之一。查哈阳农场位于大兴安岭的脚下，整个农场形成一个北高南低的缓坡。打开闸门，水顺着坡降的方向，通过渠道流入稻田。渠道上设立了许许多多保证自流灌溉畅通的附加水利工程。有一种叫十字交叉桥，水泥修成的一段渠道，下面开了桥洞，桥洞上下两股流水东西南北交叉通过，互不影响，上流引江水灌溉稻田地，下流排水入江。在查哈阳农场，每块稻田不论地势高低，水深总保持在两寸半到三寸六之间。
    查哈阳农场的职工战胜不利的自然条件的办法是足智多谋的。水稻种子下地以前，先用温水浸种摧芽，种子下地时芽胚已经萌动，因此水稻在田间的生育期就比原来缩短十天左右。特意加长加宽的渠道，使流水灌入稻田以前，有较多的时间曝晒，提高水温。水稻黄熟时，就开始撤水，保证有较高的地温，促使水稻早熟。水稻成熟以前，工人们昼夜注意气象，有的生产队每隔一小时就测量一次温度。当气温急剧下降的时候，就在低洼的稻田边爖火熏烟，保护水稻不受霜冻危害。（刘英斌、张天孔）
