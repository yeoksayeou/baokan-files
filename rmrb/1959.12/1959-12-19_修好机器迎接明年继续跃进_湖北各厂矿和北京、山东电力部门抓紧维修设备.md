Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan dispatch – Factories and mines in Hubei Province are stepping up equipment maintenance to be fully prepared for a flying start next year.

The Provincial Department of Electric Power Industry recently held a meeting to specifically deploy the overhaul tasks of power plants for this winter and next spring. The Provincial Department of Mechanical Industry plans to divide the central, provincial, and municipal-level electromechanical enterprises in the Wuhan area into several collaboration groups to support each other in producing spare parts and accessories. The Wuhan Power Supply Bureau has begun organizing its directly affiliated enterprises to overhaul equipment since November 29, planning to overhaul 670 important pieces of equipment within a month. Wuhan Iron and Steel, Daye Steel Plant, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, Qingshan Thermal Power Plant, and other enterprises have also organized special teams to overhaul equipment and rush to produce spare parts and accessories.

In the process of equipment overhaul, various localities have adopted a method combining the organization of professional teams with the development of mass maintenance activities, using the experience of phased inspection by components and live-line maintenance to accelerate the overhaul speed.

While stepping up equipment maintenance, all factories and mines have strengthened political and ideological work, educating employees to further recognize the consistency between doing a good job in equipment maintenance and increasing production. For example, a few cadres at the Wuhan Automobile Manufacturing Plant believed that "we should rush to complete production tasks now, and maintenance work should be done next year." In response to this idea, the factory's Party committee, combined with the general line education, helped employees recognize the reason that to ensure a sustained great leap forward next year, it is necessary to make full preparations in advance, thereby reversing the idea of not paying attention to equipment maintenance work. Many enterprise Party committees have incorporated equipment maintenance work into the evaluation conditions for team and individual competitions, making the majority of employees more careful in taking care of equipment, and their sense of responsibility for safe production has also been strengthened.

This newspaper reports that more than 2,000 employees of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau, who have already completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule, are actively engaged in the battle of equipment maintenance to ensure safe power supply for the city's production next year.

As of December 14, they have completed the inspection of substations, lines, and peak loads throughout the city, and have also overhauled equipment such as transformers, switches, and porcelain insulators. Currently, they are working intensively on safety maintenance work such as lightning protection and wind protection.

A few days ago, in the midst of heavy fog, many cadres, technicians, and workers from this bureau went out together, climbing mountains and wading through water in the middle of the night, and patrolling lines in the fog to understand the safety of equipment in adverse weather conditions. Employees have also carried out many modifications to historical equipment defects, unreasonable line operation conditions, and some weak links in the equipment. Geng Zijing, a veteran worker in the substation work area, and others, modified a switch to increase the capacity to cut off faults by 50%, solving the problem of insufficient capacity to cut off faults due to the increasing expansion of the power supply system. In the past, testing and repairing distribution transformers were all dismantled and transported to the repair plant, which was inefficient and prone to accidents. Now, employees have created on-site testing vehicles, greatly improving work efficiency and ensuring safety.

This newspaper reports that in order to welcome the "flying start" next year, the Shandong Province's electric power industry system has put forward the slogan of "no equipment that should be overhauled will be left for the New Year," trying every means to overhaul equipment and actively prepare for production next year to support the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. As of December 9, twelve key overhaul projects have been completed, eliminating major equipment defects such as missing turbine discs, broken blades, boiler tube leaks, and poor generator insulation, restoring and improving equipment output. The province has increased its output by more than 20,000 kilowatts, an increase of 18% compared to October.

While carrying out the overhaul of the main units, various localities have also inspected and repaired auxiliary units, such as fans, pumps, and motors. While ensuring the quality of the overhaul, they also promoted the experience of rapid overhaul in Nanding and Boshan factories, and tried to implement non-stop power overhaul on units and equipment with conditions, thus compressing the overhaul time, reducing the number of power outages, and directly supporting industrial production.

### 修好机器迎接明年继续跃进  湖北各厂矿和北京、山东电力部门抓紧维修设备

    修好机器迎接明年继续跃进
    湖北各厂矿和北京、山东电力部门抓紧维修设备
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省各工矿企业抓紧设备维护保养工作，为实现明年开门红作好充分准备。
    省电力工业厅最近召开会议，具体部署了电厂今冬明春的检修任务。省机械工业厅计划把武汉地区中央和省市所属机电企业分片组成若干协作组，互相支援，赶制备品配件。武汉电业局从11月29日起开始组织直属企业检修设备，计划在一个月内检修六百七十台重要设备。武钢、大冶钢厂、武汉重型机床厂、青山热电厂等企业，也都组织专人检修设备，赶制备品配件。
  在设备检修过程中，各地采取组织专业班子与开展群众维护保养活动相结合的方法，运用分部件分期检查和带电检修等经验，加快了检修速度。
    在抓紧设备维护保养中，各厂矿都加强政治思想工作，教育职工进一步认识搞好设备维修和提高生产的一致性。例如武汉汽车制造厂少数干部认为：“现在应该多赶生产任务，维护工作放在明年去搞”。工厂党委针对这种思想，结合总路线教育，帮助职工认清为了保证明年持续大跃进必须提前作好充分准备的道理，从而扭转了不重视设备维修工作的思想。许多企业党委把设备保养工作纳入班组和个人竞赛的评比条件，使广大职工更加爱护设备，安全生产的责任心也加强了。
    本报讯　已经提前完成今年国家计划的北京供电局两千多名职工，积极投入设备维修的战斗，保证为明年全市生产开门红安全供电。
    到12月14日止，他们已将全市的变电站、线路、高峰负荷检查完毕，变压器、开关、磁瓶等设备也都检修了一遍。目前，他们正在紧张地进行防雷、防风等安全维修工作。
    前几天，在漫天大雾中，这个局的许多干部、技术员和工人一起出动，深夜登山涉水，乘雾巡线，了解在恶劣天气中的设备安全情况。职工们还对历史性的设备缺陷、不合理的线路运行情况，以及设备中的某些薄弱环节，进行了许多改造。变电工区老工人耿子敬等改造了一种开关，使切断故障的容量提高50％，解决了供电系统日益扩大而切断故障容量不够的问题。过去试验和检修配电变压器，都是拆下来运到修检厂进行，效率很低，还容易造成事故，现在职工们创造了现场试验车，大大提高了工作效率，也保证了安全。
    本报讯　山东省电力工业系统为迎接明年“开门红”，提出“不让应检修的设备过年”的口号，千方百计检修设备，积极为明年作好生产准备，支援工农业生产的继续跃进。到12月9日止，已有十二项重点检修工程检修完毕，消除了汽轮机缺轮盘、断叶片，锅炉管泄漏，发电机绝缘不良等重大设备缺陷，恢复和提高了设备出力。全省共提高出力二万多瓩，比10月份提高了18％。
    各地在进行主要机组检修的同时，还对辅助机组，如风机、水泵、电动机等进行了检查和修理。他们还在保证检修质量的基础上，推广了南定、博山两厂快速检修的经验，在有条件的单位和设备上，尽量实行了不停电检修，因而压缩了检修时间，减少了停电次数，直接支援了工业生产。
