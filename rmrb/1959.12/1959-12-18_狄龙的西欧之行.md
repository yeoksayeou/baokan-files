Dillon's Trip to Western Europe
Chen Youwei

U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon concluded his trip to Western Europe, which began on December 7, and returned to the United States on the 14th. During these short seven days, Dillon hastily visited London, Brussels, Bonn, and Paris, and held talks with government leaders from Britain, West Germany, and France, as well as representatives from the six-nation (West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) "Common Market" and the seven-nation (Britain, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland) "Free Trade Area." Dillon summarized his trip upon leaving Paris, saying that he "found" "a consensus" everywhere and that his "trip was a great success."

What were the actual results of Dillon's trip? This must first be examined in light of whether he achieved his original objectives. According to Western news agency reports, the purpose of Dillon's "exploratory" visit was to conduct "first-hand inspections" of the situations in the "Six" and "Seven" countries in order to "find ways to eliminate economic differences that endanger European unity and the prospects for American trade."

Dillon went to Western Europe against the following backdrop: Due to the sharp increase in overseas military expenditures and capital exports, and the sharp reduction in export trade, the United States' international balance of payments deficit situation has developed to a very serious point. Following last year's $3.4 billion payment deficit, the United States' deficit will reach $4 billion this year. U.S. exports to Western Europe account for more than a quarter of total U.S. exports. However, this portion of exports decreased by a quarter last year and further decreased in the first half of this year. It is precisely under these circumstances that the economic split in Western Europe has formally formed due to the recent British-led establishment of the seven-nation "Free Trade Area" aimed at countering the six-nation "Common Market." In the United States' view, this is an "extremely serious matter." "Newsweek" wrote that the "trade war" between the "Six" and "Seven" countries "will inevitably cause discrimination against exports to each other and to the United States." Not only that, but the economic split in Western Europe is also bound to affect the so-called political "unity" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is not conducive to the United States' leadership position in this group. In order to avoid a "lose-lose" situation, some Western European countries have recently begun to favor the idea of building "a bridge" between the "Six" and "Seven" countries, seeking some degree of compromise. However, the United States believes that a compromise between the "Six" customs union and the "Seven" customs union is tantamount to the emergence of a thirteen-nation customs union that excludes the United States, which is also detrimental to the dumping of American goods in Western Europe. Therefore, the "New York Times" said that the United States also "frankly opposes any special preferential arrangements made by these two groups."

The United States does not want to see the "Six" and "Seven" countries too divided and confrontational, and it is also worried that they will reach agreements that damage American interests. Its wishful thinking is to have the United States mediate the disputes between the "Six" and "Seven" countries, thereby further inserting the United States into Western European economic affairs and strengthening its control over Western European countries. The main task of Dillon's trip to Western Europe was precisely this.

Even before Dillon set off, American news agencies had already reported that the United States was considering establishing a so-called "Atlantic Community" plan that would link the "Six," the "Seven," and North America. This well-thought-out plan of the United States obviously has the purpose of "killing two birds with one stone": it can both prevent Western Europe from discriminating against American trade and quietly seize the economic leadership of Western Europe from the "Common Market" and the "Small Free Trade Area." For those countries harmed by economic division, this plan of the United States is not without appeal. Therefore, when Dillon went to Western Europe, the list of supporters of the "Atlantic Community" plan already included West German Economics Minister Erhard, Italian Foreign Minister Pella, and the President of the European Commission of the Six, Hallstein. However, Britain and France, which are trying to use economic blocs to compete for hegemony in Western Europe, have no interest in this plan whatsoever. Although they have conflicts with each other, they are unwilling to let their painstakingly built-up advantageous position be replaced by the United States. Therefore, they are united in opposing the American plan. On the eve of Dillon's visit, the London "Times" did its best to express its opposition, arguing that the proposal for an "Atlantic Community" was "merely a fantasy." United Press International said that due to the British government's resistance, this proposal was "shelved" in the US-UK talks. In Paris, Dillon's plan also ran into snags. The French Undersecretary of the Treasury even declared at a banquet in honor of Dillon: "The French government believes that the best way to move towards easing world trade is to consolidate the European Common Market." Britain and France not only do not support the United States' "Atlantic Community" plan, but instead demand that the United States separately support the "Six" and "Seven" groups.

Under these circumstances, the United States had to settle for second best. According to Western news agency reports, the United States is now advocating reorganizing the "European Economic Cooperation Organization," which originally consisted of seventeen European countries, and using this new institution as a venue for negotiations between the two Western European blocs. At the same time, the United States would intervene and manipulate these negotiations as an "active observer," allowing American influence to penetrate into Western Europe. However, even with this lowered plan, the United States still does not have full confidence. A commentary issued by the United States Information Service on the 14th said: "The issue of reorganizing the European Economic Cooperation Organization to handle negotiations" still needs to be "discussed through diplomatic channels" and that "some kind of decision" would not be made until at least January of next year. The news indicates that Britain and France are still taking a reserved attitude towards this insidious intention of the United States. Therefore, even Dillon himself admitted that "there is still much work to be done" after he returns.

Dillon's other two missions were to directly demand that the "Six" and "Seven" countries, especially Britain, France, and West Germany, ease trade restrictions on the United States and share the United States' so-called foreign "aid." In talks with the leaders of these countries, Dillon repeatedly hoped that these countries "would not discriminate against American trade with Europe" and demanded that they adopt free trade policies towards the rest of the world, including the United States. In this regard, it cannot be said that Dillon's demands were not taken into consideration at all. West Germany has already stated that it is willing to "greatly reduce" import quotas for the dollar area. France "intends to do its part to alleviate the difficulties that the United States is currently experiencing in its balance of payments." Prior to this, Britain had also announced that it would ease some trade restrictions on the United States. But even so, Dillon's "harvest" is still very limited. According to Dillon himself, the quota that Western Europe has promised to ease will at most increase American exports to Western Europe by three or four hundred million dollars this year, which is less than a tenth of its total exports to Western Europe. This paltry income is clearly of no help in easing the United States' $4 billion deficit in the international balance of payments crisis this year.

As for the issue of sharing the so-called "aid" to underdeveloped countries, it cannot be said that the views of Western European countries are "consistent" with Dillon's. The United States' plan is not only to have Western Europe take out more "surplus" dollars to reduce the United States' international payment burden, but also to control the foreign "aid" of Western European countries in the hands of the United States, to be handled by an "international institution" dominated by the United States. But in the eyes of Western European countries, foreign "aid" is precisely a means for them to carry out economic expansion. They are absolutely unwilling to use their own funds to serve the interests of the United States. In fact, Dillon ran into a snag at his first stop, London. According to Reuters, the United States and Britain did not make a decision on this issue, but only believed that "more coordination should be carried out in the means and methods of providing assistance." Britain stated in the talks that this "aid" should be carried out through the "Colombo Plan" and "should not establish new international organizations for this purpose." The London "Financial Times" said it more clearly in an editorial welcoming Dillon: "Because Britain currently bears huge overseas investment and military obligations," "British ministers will not be able to provide Mr. Dillon with much direct assistance." In Bonn, West German Foreign Ministry State Secretary Van Scherpenberg, who participated in the talks, stated that the West German government would only "keep it in mind" "whether to establish a new coordinating agency to handle aid to underdeveloped countries." A "Asahi Shimbun" reporter in Washington believed that, on the whole, "Western European countries are not so interested in the ideas of the United States."

From all these situations, it seems that Dillon's so-called "great achievements" must at least be given a "great" discount. The main discovery of Dillon's "exploratory" visit is that the United States' position in Western Europe today is much worse than before. The days when Western European countries obeyed the United States during the "Marshall Plan" period ten years ago are gone. Due to the declining economic position of the United States and the relative increase in the economic strength of Western Europe, the United States today has to send the number two figure in the State Department to Western Europe to urgently seek help. Under these circumstances, it is of course even more difficult for the United States to manipulate the Western European economy and control Western European countries. Therefore, it can be considered that Dillon's trip to Western Europe precisely reflects the intensification of the struggle between the United States and Western Europe, as well as the major Western European countries, for markets under the influence of the law of uneven development of capitalism.

    狄龙的西欧之行
    陈有为
    美国副国务卿狄龙已经结束了他从12月7日开始的西欧之行，于14日回到美国。在这短短七天内，狄龙曾匆匆地访问了伦敦、布鲁塞尔、波恩和巴黎，同英国、西德、法国的政府领导人，以及六国（西德、法、意、比、荷、卢）“共同市场”和七国（英、挪、丹、奥、葡、瑞典、瑞士）“自由贸易区”的代表进行了会谈。狄龙在离开巴黎时总结此行说：他“到处都发现”“一致的看法”，他的“这次旅行获得了巨大的成就”。
    狄龙此行的结果究竟如何？这首先要看他是否实现了自己原定的目的。从西方通讯社的报道中可以看出，狄龙这次“试探性”访问的目的，是为了对“六国”和“七国”情况“进行一次第一手的考察”，以便“设法消除危及欧洲团结和美国贸易前景的经济上的分歧”。
    狄龙是在这样的背景下到西欧去的：由于海外军事开支与资本输出激增和出口贸易锐减，美国的国际收支逆差情况已发展到了十分严重的地步。继去年出现的三十四亿美元支付逆差以后，今年美国的逆差又将达到四十亿美元。美国对西欧的出口占美国出口总额的四分之一以上。但是这部分出口在去年下降了四分之一，今年上半年又有了进一步的下降。而正是在这种情况之下，西欧的经济分裂，由于最近英国带头建立以对抗六国“共同市场”为目的的七国“由自贸易区”正式形成了。在美国看来，这是“极为严重的事情”。美国“新闻周刊”写道，“六国”与“七国”之间的“贸易战不可避免地要造成对彼此间的出口和对美国出口的歧视”。不但如此，西欧经济上的分裂也必然要影响到北大西洋集团政治上的所谓“团结”，而不利于美国在这个集团中的领导地位。为了避免“两败俱伤”的局面，西欧的一些国家最近已开始倾向于在“六国”和“七国”之间搭“一座桥”的主张，寻求某种程度的妥协。但美国认为，“六国”关税同盟与“七国”关税同盟之间的妥协，等于是出现一个把美国摒除在外的十三国关税同盟，这对于美国商品倾销西欧同样是不利的。因此，“纽约时报”说，美国也“直率地反对这两个集团作出任何特别的优惠安排”。
    美国既不愿看到“六国”和“七国”过于分裂对抗，又担心它们之间达成有损于美国利益的协议。它的如意算盘是：由美国来排解“六国”与“七国”的纷争，借此使美国进一步插足于西欧经济事务，加强对西欧各国的控制。狄龙这次西欧之行的主要任务，也正在于此。
    还在狄龙启程之前，美国通讯社就已传出消息说，美国正在考虑建立一个把“六国”、“七国”同北美联系起来的所谓“大西洋共同体”计划。美国这个深谋远虑的计划显然具有“一箭双雕”的目的：既可以防止西欧对美国的贸易歧视，又可以把西欧的经济领导权从“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”那里悄悄地夺过来。对于那些受到经济分裂危害的国家来说，美国的这个计划是不无吸引力的。因此，狄龙前往西欧的时候，在“大西洋共同体”计划支持者名单上，已经列有西德经济部长艾哈德、意大利外长贝拉和六国欧洲委员会主席哈尔斯坦等人了。但是正在力图利用经济集团来争夺西欧霸权的英国和法国，对于这个计划却丝毫也没有兴趣。虽然它们相互有矛盾，但都不愿让自己苦心经营起来的有利地位被美国取而代之。因此它们在反对美国计划这一点上又是共同的。伦敦“泰晤士报”在狄龙访问前夕就竭力表示反对，它认为“大西洋共同体”的主张“仅仅是一种空想”而已。合众国际社说，由于英国政府的抵制，这个主张在美英会谈中“被搁置起来”了。在巴黎，狄龙的计划也遭到碰壁。法国财政部次长甚至在招待狄龙的宴会上宣称：“法国政府相信走向放宽世界贸易的最好办法是巩固欧洲共同市场”。英国和法国不但不支持美国的“大西洋共同体”计划，反倒要求美国分别支持“六国”和“七国”集团。
    在这种情况之下，美国不得不退而求其次了。据西方通讯社报道，美国现在主张改组本来由十七个欧洲国家组成的“欧洲经济合作局”，把这个新的机构作为西欧两个集团之间举行谈判的场所。同时，美国则以“积极观察员”的身分来干预和操纵这个谈判，使美国势力打入西欧内部。然而，即使是这个降低了的计划，美国也还是没有充分的把握。美国新闻处14日发出的一篇评论说：“对于改组欧洲经济合作局处理谈判的问题”，还要“通过外交途径加以讨论”，至少要到明年1月间才能“作出某种决定”。消息表明，英国和法国对于美国这种心怀叵测的意图，仍然是采取保留态度的。因此，连狄龙自己也承认，在他回去之后，“还有许多工作要做”。
    狄龙此行的另外两个使命，是直接要求“六国”、“七国”，特别是英、法、西德放宽对美国的贸易限制，分担美国的所谓对外“援助”。在同各该国领导人会谈中，狄龙一再希望这些国家“不至于歧视美国对欧洲的贸易”，要求它们对包括美国在内的世界其余部分采取自由贸易政策。在这方面，狄龙的要求不能说完全没有得到考虑。西德已经表示，愿意“大大削减”对美元地区的进口限额。法国“打算对减轻美国现在感到的支付平衡的困难尽一分力量”。在此以前，英国也已经宣布了要放宽对美国的若干贸易限制。但即使如此，狄龙的“收获”也仍然是很有限的。据狄龙本人估计，西欧答应放宽的限额，最多不过使美国今年对西欧的出口增加三、四亿美元而已，还不到它对西欧出口总额的十分之一。这笔区区的收入，对于缓和美国今年四十亿美元逆差的国际支付危机，显然无补于事。
    至于说到分担对不发达国家的所谓“援助”问题，那么西欧各国跟狄龙的“看法”更不能说是“一致”的。美国的打算是不仅要西欧拿出更多的“剩余”美元来减轻美国的国际支付负担，而且还想把西欧各国的对外“援助”控制在美国手里，由一个美国所支配的“国际机构”来统筹处理。但在西欧各国看来，对外“援助”正是它们进行经济扩张的一个手段。它们决不愿意用自己的资金来为美国的利益服务。事实上，狄龙在他的第一个落脚点伦敦，就碰了个钉子。据路透社报道，美英两国对这个问题并未作出决定，只是认为，“在提供援助的手段方法上，应该进行更多的协调工作”。英国在会谈中表示，这种“援助”应该通过“科伦坡计划”进行，“而不应为此目的建立新的国际组织”。伦敦“金融时报”在欢迎狄龙的社论里说得更明白：“由于英国目前承担庞大的海外投资和军事义务”，“英国大臣们能够向狄龙先生提供的直接帮助不会很多”。在波恩，参加会谈的西德外交部国务秘书范舍尔彭贝格表示，“对于是否要设立一个新的统筹机构来处理不发达国家的援助的问题”，西德政府只是将把它“放在心上”而已。日本“朝日新闻”驻华盛顿记者认为，整个地讲，“西欧各国对于美国的想法并不那么感到兴趣”。
    从这种种情况看来，狄龙所说的“巨大成就”，至少是要打一个“巨大”折扣的。狄龙这次“试探”访问的主要发现是：美国今天在西欧的地位是大不如昔了。十年前“马歇尔计划”时期西欧国家俯首听命于美国的日子已经过去了。由于美国经济地位江河日下而西欧经济力量却有了相对增强，美国今天已不得不派这位国务院第二号人物亲自出马到西欧去告急求援。在这种情况下，美国再要想操纵西欧经济、控制西欧各国，当然更是力不从心了。因此，可以认为：狄龙的西欧之行正是反映了在资本主义发展不平衡规律的作用下，美国同西欧以及西欧主要国家之间争夺市场斗争的加剧。
