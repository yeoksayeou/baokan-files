Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: Vietnamese Ambassador to China, Chen Ziping, held a reception this evening to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army.

Vice Premier of the State Council, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, attended the reception and extended warm congratulations to the close Vietnamese comrades-in-arms on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said that the Vietnamese People's Army is a well-trained, strong people's army with a glorious revolutionary tradition. For fifteen years, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, it has waged a heroic struggle for the independence, democracy, peace, and unification of its motherland, and for the maintenance of peace in Indochina.

Marshal Nie Rongzhen said that after the restoration of peace in the Indochina region, the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army, following the Geneva Accords, have made unremitting efforts to maintain peace in the region and to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland. However, the American imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have consistently adhered to their war policy, undermined the Geneva Accords, and obstructed the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. In order to escalate international tensions and achieve its goal of gradually turning Indochina into an American military base, American imperialism openly instigated the Lao government of Phoui Sananikone to provoke and expand the civil war. This series of facts proves that American imperialism and its running dogs in Indochina are enemies of peace in Indochina and the biggest obstacle to the realization of peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

Marshal Nie Rongzhen said, but we firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, with the support of the socialist camp and peace-loving people all over the world, will win the final and complete victory in their just struggle to safeguard the Geneva Accords and realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Ambassador Chen Ziping first delivered a speech at the beginning of the reception, introducing the glorious history of the Vietnamese People's Army's struggle and growth. He said that this revolutionary army has shown heroism in battle in the past, and today it is showing diligence and enthusiasm in peaceful labor to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

Ambassador Chen Ziping said that today, North Vietnam is joyfully carrying out socialist construction, while the South is still under the heinous rule of American imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, who intend to divide Vietnam permanently in order to turn South Vietnam into a colony and military base of American imperialism, vainly attempting to threaten and attack North Vietnam and the socialist camp.

Ambassador Chen Ziping said that our army is an army that has fought against imperialist aggressors for independence and democracy. It loves peace and is determined to do its utmost to make beneficial contributions to consolidating the cause of peace.

Among those invited to the reception were General Luo Ruiqing, Senior General Fu Zhong, Senior General Xiao Hua, Senior General Yang Chengwu, Senior General Zhang Aiping, Senior General Li Jukui, Senior General Yang Zhicheng, Senior General Li Zhimin, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Vice Admiral Zhou Xihan of the Navy, Lieutenant General Chang Qiankun of the Air Force, and Lieutenant General Qiu Chuangcheng, and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Also attending the reception were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, Ji Pengfei, and President of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association Yang Xiufeng.

Ambassadors and military attaches of various countries to China and personnel of the Vietnamese Embassy in China also attended the reception.

　　陈子平大使和聂荣臻元帅在庆祝越南建军节招待会上致词
    谴责美国阻挠越南和平统一
    新华社22日讯　越南民主共和国驻华大使陈子平今晚举行招待会，庆祝越南人民军建军十五周年。
    国务院副总理聂荣臻元帅出席了招待会，他代表中国人民解放军全体官兵向亲密的越南战友热烈祝贺。他说，越南人民军是一支久经锻炼的、有着光荣革命传统的、坚强的人民军队。十五年来，它在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，为争取祖国的独立、民主、和平和统一，以及维护印度支那的和平，进行了英勇的斗争。
    聂荣臻元帅说，在印度支那地区的和平恢复以后，越南人民和越南人民军遵循着日内瓦协议，为维护这个地区的和平和为实现祖国的和平统一作了不懈的努力。但是美帝国主义者和吴庭艳集团却一贯坚持他们的战争政策，破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的和平统一。美帝国主义者为了加剧国际紧张局势，实现它逐步把印度支那变为美国军事基地的目的，又公然唆使老挝萨纳尼空政府挑起和扩大内战。这一系列的事实证明，美帝国主义和它在印度支那的走狗们，是印度支那和平的敌人，是越南实现和平统一的最大障碍。
    聂荣臻元帅说，但是我们坚信，越南人民在社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，在维护日内瓦协议、实现祖国和平统一的正义斗争中，一定会赢得最后的、完全的胜利。
    陈子平大使在招待会开始时首先致辞，他向来宾介绍了越南人民军斗争成长的光荣历史。他说，这支革命军队过去在战斗中表现了英雄气概，今天在和平劳动中表现了勤劳积极，来建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南。
    陈子平大使说，今天越南北方正在欢欣鼓舞地进行社会主义建设，而南方还处在美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的罪恶统治下，它们打算长期分割越南国土，以便把越南南方变为美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地，妄图威胁和进攻越南北方以及社会主义阵营。
    陈子平大使说，我们的军队是一支曾经反击帝国主义侵略者，为争取独立、民主而战斗的军队，它酷爱和平，并坚决竭尽自己的力量对巩固和平事业作出有益的贡献。
    应邀出席招待会的有，罗瑞卿大将、傅钟上将、萧华上将、杨成武上将、张爱萍上将、李聚奎上将、杨至诚上将、李志民上将、萧向荣中将、周希汉海军中将、常乾坤空军中将、丘创成中将等中国人民解放军高级将领。出席招待会的还有外交部副部长罗贵波、姬鹏飞，中越友好协会会长杨秀峰。
    各国驻华大使和武官以及越南驻华大使馆人员也出席了招待会。
