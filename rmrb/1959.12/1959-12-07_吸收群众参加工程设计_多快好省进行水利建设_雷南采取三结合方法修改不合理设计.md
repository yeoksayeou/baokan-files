    Absorb the Masses to Participate in Engineering Design
    Build Water Conservancy Projects with Greater, Faster, Better and More Economical Results
    Leinan Adopts a Three-Combination Method to Revise Unreasonable Designs
    (Our Newspaper News) Guangdong's Leinan County, in the design of water conservancy projects, used the working method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and peasant masses, greatly breaking old rules and regulations. Under the premise of ensuring project quality, it saved a large amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and can greatly accelerate the speed of project construction.
    According to preliminary statistics, from the currently revised designs of ten projects with an area of more than 10,000 mu, 20 tons of steel, 3,300 bags of cement, 2.1 million cubic meters of earthwork, 14,550 cubic meters of stonework, and 130 cubic meters of wood have been saved, reducing 950,000 workdays.
    During the previous stage in Leinan County when designing various water conservancy projects, the working method of the mass line of three-combination was not adopted, so some projects did not make good use of the terrain and landforms in the selection of dam sites and canals; in terms of material selection, on-site material acquisition was not achieved, resulting in excessive filling or excavation of earthwork, excessive use of stonework, and excessive use of materials, resulting in waste. After discovering this situation, the county party committee required all localities to not only vigorously mobilize the masses during the construction process, but also mobilize the masses in the design of the project, and listen to the opinions of the masses. Li Zhenxing, the first secretary of the county party committee, Wang Tiancai, the secretary of the county party committee, and Yao Jiaru, the deputy county head, and engineers, etc., immediately formed a working group and went deep into the sites of various major projects, visiting the masses on the one hand, observing the terrain on the other hand, and repeatedly studying and comparing with engineers and technicians, jointly thinking of ways, and even making several plans, asking everyone to choose the plan with the best quality, the most irrigation, and the least manpower and material resources.
    The working group went to the Longmen Reservoir with a water storage capacity of 50 million cubic meters, inspected the site of several key sections of the main canal of the reservoir, and repeatedly solicited the opinions of local people and construction workers, and found that due to the lack of on-site investigation, the design of this project had the error of not basing itself on the terrain and not setting the line from reality. For example, in the Jinbo Lake main canal section of the Pinghu Brigade, there was a huge filling project that required taking soil from high ground 500 meters away, filling 240,000 cubic meters, and at the same time using a large number of materials to build five large reinforced concrete culverts. The entire project required 600,000 workdays and 1,000 bags of cement, 6 tons of steel, 100,000 jin of lime, and 600 cubic meters of sea sand.
    After on-site observation by the working group, careful deliberation one by one, and repeated solicitation of opinions from local construction workers, it was finally decided to use the natural terrain, detour to open the canal, and use excavation instead of filling. Although this plan requires excavating 300,000 cubic meters of soil, it can be excavated and unloaded on the spot, the entire process is only one process; while filling requires four processes: digging, loading, transporting, unloading, and ramming, which is equivalent to four times the amount of work of excavation. Moreover, using excavation instead of filling can also save five concrete culverts, saving the country a large amount of materials, saving 300,000 workdays, and completing the project one and a half months ahead of schedule than originally planned.
    In the process of on-site observation, the working group also found that the original design plan did not use the natural slope position to break ground on the entire main canal line, but uniformly required breaking ground on a straight line, which increased a large amount of workload. After joint research by the working group and the masses, it was decided to make full use of the natural slope to break ground, and promote the method of half-excavation and half-filling or more excavation and less filling. In this way, the canal with a total length of 97 kilometers and an original design of 3 million cubic meters of soil, after revising the design plan, not only strengthened the quality and did not reduce the benefited area, but also saved 1 million cubic meters of soil, and could also be completed one month ahead of schedule.
    The working group arrived at the Dongwu Reservoir in Nanxing Commune, listened to the report, and learned that the 80 million cubic meters of stone required for the reservoir project needed to be transported from 10 kilometers away. Relying on the construction workers at the construction site would require half a year to complete this task, even if all the county's cars were dispatched, it would take ten days of surprise attacks to complete. The working group immediately conducted an investigation and research, deeply visited the masses, studied the materials, and after repeated review of the blueprints and on-site comparison and observation, finally believed that as long as the water-saving wall was built well and the dam body was protected, 220 cubic meters of stone could be saved.
    In the ten major water conservancy sites visited by the working group, due to the full mobilization of the masses and better use of the terrain and landforms, the original design plans of six reservoir projects with an area of more than 10,000 mu have been revised, achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

### 吸收群众参加工程设计  多快好省进行水利建设  雷南采取三结合方法修改不合理设计

    吸收群众参加工程设计
    多快好省进行水利建设
    雷南采取三结合方法修改不合理设计
    本报讯　广东雷南县在水利工程设计方面，运用领导干部、技术人员和农民群众三结合的工作方法，大破陈规旧矩，在保证工程质量的前提下，节约了大批人力物力和财力，并且可以大大加快工程建设速度。
    根据初步统计，从目前已修改的十宗万亩以上的工程设计看来，已经节约出钢筋二十吨、水泥三千三百包、二百一十万个土方、一万四千五百五十个石方、一百三十立方木材，减少了九十五万个工作日。
    雷南县前一段设计各项水利工程的时候，没有采取三结合的群众路线的工作方法，因而有部分工程在坝址和渠道的选择方面，没有很好利用地形地物；在取材方面，没有做到就地取材，造成了多填或多取土方、多用石方、多用器材等等浪费现象。县委在发现这种情况以后，要求各地不仅在施工过程要大力发动群众，在工程设计方面也要发动群众，听取群众的意见。县委第一书记李振兴、县委书记王天才和副县长姚家儒、工程师等立即组成工作组，深入各个主要工程的现场，一面访问群众，一面观察地形，与工程师、技术员再三研究、再三比较，共同想办法，甚至作出几个方案，叫大家选择质量最好、灌溉最多、用人力物力最省的方案。
    工作组到了储水五千万立方米的龙门水库，检查了这个水库主渠的几个关键工段的现场，反复征求当地群众和工地民工的意见，发现由于缺乏实地调查，这个工程在设计上存在不根据地形、不从实际出发定线的错误。例如，在平湖大队的金泊湖主渠工段，有一段庞大的填方工程需要在五百米以外的高地取土，填方二十四万立方米，同时要用大批材料建造五个钢筋混凝土大涵。整个工程需六十万个工作日和一千包水泥、六吨钢筋、十万斤石灰、六百立方海沙。
    经过工作组实地观察，逐一推敲，反复征求当地民工的意见，最后决定了利用天然地形，绕道开渠，以挖方代填方的新方案。这个方案虽然要挖土三十万立方米，但是可以就地挖就地卸，全部过程仅一个工序；而填方则要经过起土、装土、运土、卸土、打夯四个工序，相当四倍于挖方的工作量。而且用挖方比用填方还可以节省五个混凝土大涵，为国家节约大批材料，节省三十万个工作日，比原定完工时间提早一个半月。
    工作组在实地观察的过程中，还发现原设计方案中主渠全线不利用天然坡斜的位置破土，而是千篇一律地要求在一条直线上破土，这就增加了很大的工作量。工作组和群众共同研究后，决定充分利用天然坡斜破土，推广半挖半填或多挖少填的办法。这样，全程九十七公里、原设计为三百万立方土的渠道，经过修改设计方案，不但加强了质量、不减少受益面积，而且节约一百万立方土，还可以提前一个月完工。
    工作组到达南兴公社的东吴水库，听取了汇报，了解到这个水库工程所需的八千万立方石，需要在十公里以外取运。这项任务依靠工地民工就需要半年时间，即便是全县全部汽车出动也需要十天突击才能完成。工作组立即进行了调查研究，深入访问群众，研究资料，经过反复审查蓝图，实地对照观察，最后认为只要做好节水墙，保护坝身，就可以节约石头二百二十个立方米。
    在工作组到过的十大水利工地，由于充分发动了群众，更好地利用地形地物，已有六宗万亩以上的水库工程修改了原设计方案，做到了多快好省。
