    Saigon Dispatch: The Saigon "National Revolution Daily" recently published a document by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique called "The Policy Towards Former Resistance Members," which fabricated and distorted the entire history of the Vietnamese national liberation struggle. It attempts to negate the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party in the Vietnamese national liberation war and, in the name of "anti-communism," further persecute former resistance members.

    The document first distorts the glorious history of the August Revolution led by the Indochinese Communist Party (the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party) in 1945, establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It nonsensically claims that "the August 1945 uprising was isolated and did not receive the sympathy and support of the world" because "the heads of the Viet Minh regime in 1945 were all communists." The document tries to force the Vietnamese people to believe that "the Viet Cong did not resist the war, and Communist Party and Vietnam Workers' Party members are not resistance fighters." The document openly stipulates that "all members, cadres, and leading cadres of the Indochinese Communist Party and the Vietnam Workers' Party cannot be considered former resistance members"; and that everyone who "approached the Communist Party," "whether or not they are Communist Party members," are also "not former resistance members." The document even lists the signing of the Geneva Accords as a major crime, saying that this is "a standard for distinguishing between resistance members and the Viet Cong." The South Vietnamese authorities' document clamors to "severely punish Viet Cong saboteurs" after "distinguishing" between the so-called "former resistance members and Viet Cong saboteurs." In this document, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique even dresses itself up as "anti-Japanese war heroes," shamelessly saying that "the current (South Vietnamese) national government is led by President Ngo and is no longer a puppet government of colonialists like before."

    The Ngo Dinh Diem clique's so-called "Statement on the Policy Towards Former Resistance Members" has been strongly condemned by the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, strongly protested in a letter to the International Commission for Vietnam on November 21 against the South Vietnamese authorities' intensified and frenzied "sweeps" in the western region of the South in recent months. He solemnly pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities' promulgation of the so-called "Policy Towards Former Resistance Members" aims to discriminate against and intensify the persecution of former resistance members. The Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam also issued a statement on December 3 regarding the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's historically falsified document, pointing out that the South Vietnamese authorities' promulgation of the so-called "Policy Towards Former Resistance Members" is a conspiracy to divide the people of South Vietnam, further persecute patriots, especially organizations, groups, and individuals who participated in the war of resistance against French colonialists in the past, and attempt to extinguish the patriotic movement in South Vietnam through brutal actions.

    斥南越当局加紧迫害爱国者
    本报讯　西贡消息：西贡“国家革命报”最近发表了吴庭艳集团的所谓“前抗战人员的政策”的文件，这个文件伪造和歪曲了越南民族解放斗争的全部历史，企图否定越南劳动党对越南民族解放战争的领导作用，并在“反共”的名义下进一步残害前抗战人员。
    文件首先歪曲了1945年印度支那共产党（越南劳动党的前身）领导越南人民发动八月革命，建立越南民主共和国的光辉历史，胡说什么“1945年8月的起义是孤立的，没有得到世界的同情与支持”，因为“1945年越盟政权的首脑都是共产党人”。文件硬要越南人民相信，“越共没有抗过战，共产党和越南劳动党党员不是抗战者”。文件公然规定：“印支共党及越南劳动党的全部党员、干部、首脑干部都不能算是前抗战人员”；而一切“靠近共党”，“不论是否共产党员”也都“不是前抗战人员”。文件甚至把签订日内瓦协议列为一大罪状，说这是“据以分别抗战人员及越共的一项标准”。南越当局的这项文件，大叫要在“分清”所谓“前抗战人员和越共破坏分子以后，严厉惩治越共破坏分子”。吴庭艳集团在这项文件中还居然把自己打扮成“抗战英雄”，恬不知耻地说什么“现在（南越）国家政府得到吴总统的领导，不再像以前那样是殖民者的傀儡政府了。”
    吴庭艳集团的所谓“对前抗战人员政策的声明”发表以后，遭到了越南民主共和国政府和人民的强烈谴责。越南人民军总司令武元甲大将在11月21日写给越南国际委员会的信里强烈抗议南越当局最近几个月来变本加厉地对南部西面地区进行疯狂的“扫荡”，并且严正地指出，南越当局颁布所谓“对前抗战人员的政策”，目的在于歧视和加紧迫害前抗战人员。越南国会常务委员会也在12月3日就吴庭艳集团的这项伪造历史的文件发表声明指出，南越当局颁布所谓“对前抗战人员的政策”，是阴谋分化南越人民，进一步迫害爱国人士，尤其是迫害过去曾经参加过抵抗法国殖民者战争的组织、团体和人士，企图用残暴的行动来扑灭南越的爱国运动。
