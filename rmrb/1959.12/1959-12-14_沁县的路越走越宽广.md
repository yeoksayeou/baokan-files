The Roads of Qin County are Getting Wider and Wider
Shen Luming, First Secretary of the CCP Qin County Committee, Shanxi

It has been over a year since Qin County, Shanxi, organized local industry to serve agricultural production. People want to know: How is Qin County doing?

From Combination to Specialization

People's attention to local industry in Qin County initially focused on the "All-in-One Treasure" - the county's United Processing Factory. Now, what about this "All-in-One Treasure"?

The predecessor of the Qin County "All-in-One Treasure" factory was a specialized egg factory. To meet the needs of development, in 1957 this specialized egg factory developed into a United Processing Factory engaged in multiple industries, operating agricultural machinery repair, power generation, oil pressing, printing, fertilizer production, and flour milling, among other things. At the time, people called this factory the "All-in-One Treasure." After the Great Leap Forward, especially after the people's communes were established, agriculture placed higher and more urgent demands on industry. The countryside needed factories to promptly supply large quantities of means of production and consumer goods, and to process more agricultural and sideline products. Obviously, the original scale and content of the United Processing Factory, as well as its diversified management, were difficult to meet these needs. Thus, the county's United Processing Factory expanded and developed into seven specialized factories (agricultural machinery factory, agricultural product processing factory, chemical fertilizer factory, power plant, printing factory, flour processing factory, egg factory), implementing small-scale combinations within large-scale specializations. As a result, each specialized factory achieved great improvements and developments on the original basis. For example, the machinery repair section, which originally had thirty-four workers and four dilapidated machine tools, has now developed into a medium-sized agricultural machinery factory with more than three hundred and twenty employees and thirty-six indigenous and foreign machine tools. Its products include boiler-camel machines, gas engines, plows, hoes, sickles, axes, and more than seventy other varieties. It not only fully supplies local needs but also supports large factories and mines such as the Huaihai Machinery Factory. Six kinds of products, including artificial rainmaking machines, were even selected for exhibition abroad. After the oil pressing section developed into an agricultural product processing factory, its products, in addition to oils, also include wine, sugar, soy sauce, monosodium glutamate, and water tobacco. Thus, the "All-in-One Treasure" factory in Qin County has gone through four stages from small-scale specialization to large-scale combination (small-scale specialization) to large-scale specialization (small-scale combination) to "joint egg-laying". This is the inevitable trend of local industry developing to a higher stage.

The method of "joint egg-laying" is an important way for local industry in Qin County to achieve great development. For example, when setting up a cotton weaving factory, there was no capital, no equipment, and no workers. So several specialized factories joined together to "lay eggs," transferring accountants, workers, and factory directors from each factory, and also transferring some machinery and tools. The agricultural machinery factory was also responsible for manufacturing machinery and ironware, and the woodworking factory was responsible for repairing and manufacturing wooden tools and utensils. As a result, a cotton weaving factory with thirty machines was put into production in just over twenty days. Through the same method, nine factories, including a machine-made paper factory, a bacterial fertilizer factory, and a pesticide factory, were also built.

The experience of Qin County's "All-in-One Treasure" has not been discarded. Under the active support of the "All-in-One Treasure," commune industries throughout the county have set up many factories, making the "All-in-One Treasure" factories widespread throughout the county.

Advancing in Struggle

The entire process of the development of local industry in Qin County is also a process of struggle against various right-leaning conservative ideas. The focus of this struggle is: should industry be developed in isolation, or should local industry and agriculture develop side by side?

The most acute struggle was this spring. After the issue of strengthening the agricultural front was raised, a gust of "industry downsizing" swept through Qin County. This trend seemed to be a contradiction between labor in industry and agriculture, but in essence, it was a debate over whether industry and agriculture could be developed simultaneously. At this time, the county party committee also considered a series of issues. For example, what position should local industry be placed in? How should the labor problem between industry and agriculture be solved? How should local industry further serve agricultural production? And so on. According to the spirit of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the county party committee conducted a specific and comprehensive analysis of the situation in the county's rural areas. The county party committee believed that the shortage of rural labor required industry to manufacture more and better tools to create favorable conditions for industry and agriculture to improve labor productivity and solve the labor shortage; at the same time, it was necessary to produce more and better commodities to meet the needs of commune members and the market. Therefore, the county party committee put forward the slogan "Oriented towards agriculture, also oriented towards the market, serving the rural economy in an all-round way" to local industry. At the same time, it also spoke extensively about the situation to cadres and masses throughout the county, and organized a major debate on the topic of "whether local industry should be launched or downsized, and how to run local industry." The county party committee conducted pilot projects for the rectification of local industry; party organizations at all levels conducted a comprehensive summary and analysis of the achievements and situations since the establishment of industry. After more than two months of debate, pilot projects, summary, and analysis, the vivid facts refuted the fallacy that local industry "outweighs its benefits" and gave a strong rebuff to various right-leaning remarks. In this series of activities, the county party committee also gained many inspirations and adopted the policy of "specific alignment, adapting to local conditions, building when appropriate, stopping when appropriate" for industry throughout the county, compressing and shutting down twenty-seven small factories that were not urgently needed, wasted labor, and had insufficient raw material supply, reducing labor by three hundred and thirty people and transferring them to the agricultural front; at the same time, according to the urgent needs of production and life and the objective conditions, adjustments were made from the potential of the original factory equipment and labor, restoring and newly building nineteen factories in eleven projects such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and non-staple foods. In this way, the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously was implemented more deeply and practically, the local industrial enterprises were consolidated, production management was also improved, industrial production was developed, and it was done better and more closely to serve agricultural production and the market.

Where Does the Labor Come From?

Qin County lacks mineral resources and coal, has a sparse population, has a weak industrial base, has very low grain yields, has a narrow range of sideline occupations, and its diversified economy is very underdeveloped. It really has no money and no raw materials. In terms of people, out of a population of 120,000, there are only 32,000 laborers, cultivating nearly 500,000 mu of land, and also supporting large-scale industry, building reservoirs, building highways... There is no one, can industry be run? Can it be developed? Many people asked worriedly. However, the development policy of "oriented towards agriculture, also oriented towards the market, serving the rural economy in an all-round way" has strengthened local industry in Qin County, and the future is getting brighter and broader.

So, where does the labor come from? Where do the raw materials come from? Where does the funding come from?

Adhering to the method of solving the labor problem by running industry, first liberating labor for agriculture, can strengthen industry itself. In 1957, there were only 237 employees in local industry in Qin County. They faced agriculture, repairing and renovating machinery and tools for the countryside, self-made and installed small steel mills, irrigation and drainage machinery, and complete sets of equipment for reservoirs, which gave farmers a lot of convenience and greatly improved labor productivity. For example, the created automatic loading and unloading high-altitude soil transport machine used on the reservoir could top the workload of two hundred people. The county calculated a large account, only the transformation and creation of various machines and tools, saved the county more than 800,000 labor days, equivalent to 140% of the total number of man-days invested in water conservancy construction in the county that year. Secondly, the original industry was consolidated. Taking the United Processing Factory as an example, the output value increased by 70.5% compared with the previous year, and labor productivity increased by 79.13%. Third, a large number of laborers saved from agriculture were drawn out to support industry. In this year, the number of workers in the county gradually increased from more than 200 to more than 1,300. However, before the realization of mechanization and electrification, there was always a shortage of labor. The county party committee insisted on using the method of running industry to solve the labor problem. On the two fronts of industry and agriculture, a "red, diligent, and clever competition" movement was widely launched to improve labor productivity in all aspects. The industrial front focused on competing in "cleverness" on the basis of red and diligent, making a big deal on the word "clever," "using the cleverness of industry to promote the cleverness of agriculture." On the one hand, vigorously create, transform and produce a large number of agricultural machinery, as well as tools for canteens and other aspects, give full play to the effectiveness of existing agricultural machinery; on the other hand, vigorously reform the machinery, tools and equipment of industry itself, improve the labor productivity of industry itself; on the other hand, constantly oppose labor waste on the industrial front, tap labor potential, rationally adjust labor organization, and carry out rationalization proposal movement, so that factories are cleverly arranged and cleverly produced.

Where Does the Funding Come From?

Orienting towards the countryside, orienting towards the market, and opening up more ways for agricultural production can raise funds for industrial development. This is the main aspect of Qin County's fund-raising for industry. The Guo Village Commune area lacks labor and is poor. Because it is poor, it has to spend a lot of money every year to add agricultural tools and purchase fertilizers. The purchase of chemical fertilizers alone costs more than 20,000 yuan per year. In 1957, this area spent more than 600 yuan to set up seven small factories such as fertilizer, iron, and woodworking industries. In one year, they strung together villages to repair and build agricultural tools, saving labor and money, not to mention, they produced more than 240,000 jin of chemical fertilizer alone, saving more than 13,000 yuan in investment in purchasing chemical fertilizer. The following year, they had money, and the factory developed to eleven, with an industrial output value of 230,000 yuan. By the third year, that is, 1959, the factory developed to twenty-one, including three fertilizer factories with an annual output of 100 tons of chemical fertilizer, and three water and thermal power stations; not only did the income of commune members increase, but the commune also had money to buy tractors and establish a tractor station. This year, their industrial output value will reach 400,000 yuan.

Where Do The Raw Materials Come From?

Vigorously engaging in diversified operations, establishing raw material bases for industry, and promoting industrial production; establishing commodity bases for commerce, and promoting commodity production; at the same time, increasing commune accumulation and strengthening the commune economy. This is the way Qin County's local industrial development solves the raw material problem. Lacking mineral resources and coal, without steel or iron, with poor mountains and land, and scarce wild resources. However, poor mountains can be turned into treasure mountains, and poor land can be turned into rich land. What's more, poor mountains and poor land always have some things to use. Therefore, the slogan of "industry leading, adapting to local conditions, making full use of mountains, making full use of land, making full use of people's talents, making full use of materials, and developing diversified economy" was put forward. There are hundreds of herbs on the mountains, and the by-products in the fields are corn stalks, hemp stalks, and wheat straw, so machine-made paper factories and various indigenous paper factories are set up; there are wild medicinal materials on the mountains, so medicinal material processing factories are set up; there is peat, so granular fertilizer factories are set up; there is broken glass accumulated for many years in the countryside, so glass factories are set up. In this way, all the past agricultural and sideline products and waste products are used to set up various types of large and small factories. Some local specialties that were produced in the past, such as sweet fruits and milk, have not been able to develop due to the difficulty of transportation. Therefore, sugar factories, milk powder factories, non-staple food processing factories, and various agricultural product processing factories are set up. The establishment of these factories has promoted and driven large-scale planting and breeding. Now, the number of county-run factories in the county has developed from one in 1957 to thirty-seven, and the number of commune factories has developed from "a blank sheet of paper" to one hundred and ninety-seven; the number of employees has increased from more than two hundred in 1957 to three thousand seven hundred and forty-eight. Various large and small factories in Qin County form an urban and rural industrial network centered on the county agricultural machinery factory and with the commune united processing factory as the backbone, and have initially formed six major industrial systems serving the rural economy in an all-round way, including machinery, electricity, chemical industry, agricultural product processing, daily sundries, and building materials. The industrial output value in 1958 increased by 37.7% compared with 1957. As of the end of October this year, the completed output value has reached 4,886,000 yuan, an increase of 71.5% compared with the full-year output value in 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward. It is estimated that the full-year output value will account for 33.6% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the county.

It is hard to imagine that if it were not for serving the rural economy in an all-round way, local industry would have achieved such development in a small county with a severe shortage of labor, a lack of mineral resources and coal, and poor mountains and land. More importantly, this local industrial network, which has taken initial shape and has six major systems, has laid a preliminary foundation for realizing the technological transformation of agriculture and realizing agricultural modernization.

    沁县的路越走越宽广
    中共山西沁县县委第一书记　申鲁明
    山西沁县组织地方工业为农业生产服务至今一年多了，人们希望知道：沁县究竟搞得怎么样了？
  　从联合到专业
    人们注意沁县地方工业，首先是沁县的“万宝全”——县联合加工厂。现在，这个“万宝全”怎么样了呢？
    沁县“万宝全”工厂的前身，是一个专业蛋厂。为了适应发展的需要，1957年这个专业蛋厂发展成了多种行业联合经营的联合加工厂，经营着农业机械修配、发电、榨油、印刷、化肥、磨面等六种业务。当时，人们称这座工厂是“万宝全”。大跃进以后，特别是人民公社化以后，农业对工业提出了更高更迫切的要求。农村需要工厂及时供应大量的生产资料和生活资料，需要加工更多的农副土特产品。显然，原有联合加工厂的规模和内容，以及多种经营的形式，就很难适应需要了。这样，县联合加工厂便扩大发展为七个专业工厂（农业机械厂、农产品加工厂、化学肥料厂、发电厂、印刷厂、面粉加工厂、蛋厂），大专业中实行小联合。因此，各专业厂在原来的基础上，都获得了大提高、大发展。如原有三十四个工人和四部破烂机床的机械修理工段，现在已发展成为拥有三百二十多个职工、三十六部土、洋机床的中型农业机械厂了；产品有锅驼机、煤气机、犁、锄、镰、斧等七十多种。不仅充分供应本地需要，而且还支援淮海机械厂等大厂矿，还有人工降雨机等六种产品被选出国参加展览。榨油工段发展为农产品加工后，产品除油类外，还有酒、糖、酱油、味精、水烟等。这样，沁县的“万宝全”工厂就从小到大经历了“小专业——大联合（小专业）——大专业（小联合）——联合下蛋”四个阶段。这是地方工业向更高阶段发展的必然趋势。
    联合下蛋的办法，是沁县地方工业得到大发展的重要方法。如在办棉织厂的时候，一无资金，二无设备，三无工人。于是几个专业厂联合起来“下蛋”，从各厂抽调会计、工人、厂长，又从各厂抽调了一些机具；农业机械厂还负责制造机械和铁器，木工厂负责修制木制工具和木制器皿。结果一座拥有三十台机器的棉织厂，只花了二十多天就投入了生产。通过同样的办法，还建成了机制纸厂、细菌肥料厂、农药厂等九座工厂。
    沁县“万宝全”的经验并没有丢掉，全县公社工业在“万宝全”的积极扶植和支持下，办起了许多工厂，使得“万宝全”工厂遍及全县。
        在斗争中前进
    沁县地方工业发展的整个过程，也是和各种右倾保守思想斗争的过程。这个斗争的焦点是：是孤立地发展工业呢？还是地方工业和农业并肩发展呢？
    斗争最尖锐的是今年春天。在加强农业战线的问题提出以后，沁县就刮起了一股“工业下马”的歪风。这股歪风从形式上看好像是工农业的劳力有矛盾，而实质上是工农业能不能并举之争。就在这个时候，县委也考虑了一系列的问题。比如地方工业应该摆在什么位置上？工农业之间的劳力问题应如何解决，地方工业应如何更进一步为农业生产服务？等等。县委根据党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的精神，对全县农村的形势进行了具体全面的分析，县委认为：农村劳力紧张，这就要求工业制造更多更好的工具，为工农业提高劳动生产率、解决劳力不足创造良好的条件；同时要生产更多更好的商品，供应社员和市场需要。于是，县委向地方工业提出了“面向农业，也面向市场，为农村经济全面服务”的口号。同时，还向全县干部和群众大讲形势，并以“地方工业是上马还是下马、如何办地方工业”为题组织了一次大辩论。县委对地方工业的整顿进行了试点；各级党组织对办工业以来的成绩和情况，进行了全面的总结和分析。经过两个多月的辩论、试点、总结分析，活生生的事实，驳倒了地方工业“得不偿失”的谬论，给各式各样的右倾言论以有力的回击。在这一系列的活动中，县委也获得了许多启示，对全县工业采取了“具体排队，因地制宜，该办则办，该停则停”的方针，将并不迫切需要、劳力有浪费、原料供应不上的二十七个小工厂进行了紧缩、停办，缩减劳力三百三十人，放到农业战线上去；同时根据生产、生活急需，客观条件又可能的，从原有的工厂设备和劳力的潜力中进行调整，恢复和新建了化肥、农药、副食等十一个项目的十九个工厂。这样一来，就更深入更实际地贯彻了工农业并举的方针，使地方工业企业巩固了，生产管理也提高了，工业生产发展了，做到了更好更密切地为农业生产和市场服务。
        劳力哪里来？
    沁县少矿无煤、地广人稀，工业基础薄弱，粮食产量很低，副业门路不广，多种经济很不发达。真是要钱没钱，要原料没原料。说人，十二万人口中只有三万二千个劳力，耕种着近五十万亩土地，还要支援大工业、修水库、修公路……要人没人，办工业行吗？能发展吗？不少人担心地提出疑问。然而，“面向农业，也面向市场，为农村经济全面服务”的发展方针，使沁县地方工业壮大了，前途越来越光辉远大。
    那么，劳力从何而来？原料又从哪来？经费从哪来？
    坚持用办工业的办法解决劳力问题，先为农业解放劳力，就能壮大工业自己。1957年，沁县地方工业只有职工二百三十七人，他们面向农业，为农村修配、改制机械和工具，自制与安装小钢磨、排灌机械和水库的整套设备，给农民许多方便，大大提高了劳动生产率。如创制的自动装卸高空运土机在水库上使用，一部就顶二百人的工作量。全县算了一笔大账，仅是改制、创制的各种机具，就为全县节省了八十多万个劳动日，等于当年全县全年水利建设投工总数的140％。其次，使原有的工业巩固了。以联合加工厂为例，产值比上年增长了70.5％，劳动生产率增长了79.13％。第三、农业节省下来的大批劳力，抽出来支援工业。这一年中，全县工人由二百多人陆续增加到了一千三百多人。但是，在未实现机械化、电气化之前，劳力总是不足的，县委坚持了用办工业的办法来解决劳力问题。在工农业两条战线上，广泛开展“红勤巧竞赛”运动，从各方面提高劳动生产率。工业战线，在红勤的基础上集中赛“巧”，从“巧”字上大作文章，“以工之巧，促农之巧”。一方面大力创制、改制和大量生产农业机械，以及食堂等各方面的工具，充分发挥现有农业机械的效力；另一方面大力改革工业本身的机械、工具和设备，提高工业本身的劳动生产率；再一方面是，在工业战线上不断地反劳力浪费，挖掘劳动潜力，合理调整劳动组织，开展合理化建议运动，使厂厂都是巧安排、巧生产。
        经费哪里来？
    面向农村，面向市场，为农业增产广开门路，就能为工业发展筹集资金。这是沁县筹集工业资金的主要方面。郭村公社地区既缺劳力，又穷。穷，每年得拿出许多钱来添置农具，购买肥料，仅每年购买化肥，就得花两万元以上。1957年这个地区用六百多元办起了肥料、铁、木业等七个小工厂，一年中串村修打农具，省下工和钱不说，光化肥就生产了二十四万多斤，省下购买化肥投资一万三千多元。第二年他们有了钱，工厂发展到十一座，工业产值达到二十三万元。到了第三年，也就是1959年，工厂发展到二十一座，其中有年产百吨化肥的三个肥料厂，还有三处水、火电站；不仅社员的收入增加了，而且公社还有钱买了拖拉机，成立了拖拉机站。今年他们的工业产值将达到四十万元。
        原料哪里来？
    大搞多种经营，为工业建立原料基地，促进工业生产；为商业建立商品基地，促进商品生产；同时增加了公社积累，壮大了公社经济。这是沁县地方工业发展解决原料问题的途径。少矿无煤，无钢无铁，山穷地贫，野生资源贫乏。然而，穷山可以变宝山，贫地可以变富地，何况穷山、贫地总有几物可用。于是，提出了“工字领先，因地制宜，山尽其利，地尽其力，人尽其才，物尽其用，发展多种经济”的口号。山上有百草，地里副产物有玉米秆、麻秆、麦秸，就开办机制纸厂和各种土制纸厂；山上有野生药材，就办药材加工厂；有草炭就开办颗粒肥料厂；乡村有多年积存的破碎玻璃，就开办玻璃厂。这样把以往的农副土特产品及废品等全部利用起来，开办各种类型的大小工厂。一些过去生产的如甜果、牛奶等土特产品，由于调运困难，一直发展不起来。于是就开办糖厂、奶粉厂、副食品加工厂和各种农产品加工厂，这些工厂的开办，又促进和带动了大种大养。现在，全县县营工厂由1957年的一座发展到三十七座，公社工厂由“一张白纸”发展到一百九十七座；职工由1957年的二百多人增加到三千七百四十八人。各种大小工厂在沁县组成了一个以县农业机械厂为中心、公社联合加工厂为骨干的城乡工业网，并且已经初步形成了为农村经济全面服务的机械、电力、化学、农产品加工、日用杂品、建筑材料等六大工业体系，1958年的工业产值比1957年增长了37.7％。今年截至10月底，已完成产值四百八十八万六千元，比大跃进的1958年全年产值增长了71.5％。预计全年产值将占全县工农业总产值的33.6％。
    很难想像，如果不是为农村经济全面服务的话，在这样一个劳力奇缺、少矿无煤、山贫地穷的小县，地方工业会得到这样的发展。更重要的是这个初具规模具有六大体系的地方工业网，为实现农业技术改造、实现农业现代化奠定了初步的基础。
