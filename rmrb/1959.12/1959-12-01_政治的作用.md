Editorial Notes

The Role of Politics

The news of the Caishikou Department Store learning from and catching up with Tianqiao Department Store vividly tells people that putting politics in command is a huge driving force for the progress of all work.

The Tianqiao Department Store is a red flag in commercial work. More than a year ago, the Caishikou Department Store put forward the slogan of "learning from Tianqiao and catching up with Tianqiao," but it never learned well or caught up. After the anti-Rightist struggle, it truly implemented putting politics in command in its business operations. In just over a month, it accomplished what it had not been able to do in the past year. What a clear contrast this is.

We often say that politics is the commander, and ideology is the soul. Some comrades also acknowledge the correctness of these two sentences in principle, but they often neglect this principle in specific business operations. Therefore, various confused ideas cannot be clarified, the work enthusiasm is not sufficiently boosted, and naturally, the positive factors in all aspects cannot be mobilized. As a result, although plans for learning from advanced units and catching up with advanced units are made, they still cannot be realized, and the work of the unit either remains stagnant or gets worse. What happened in the Caishikou Department Store in the past is a good illustration.

Now, under the leadership of the Party branch, all the employees of the Caishikou Department Store have found a broad path from exploration. We hope that they will advance victoriously and head towards a more distant future. We also hope that other enterprises and institutions with situations similar to the Caishikou Department Store will also conscientiously implement the principle of putting politics in command in their work and push their work to a new height.

    政治的作用
    菜市口百货商场学天桥、赶天桥的新闻，用显明的事实告诉人们：政治挂帅是一切工作前进的巨大动力。
    天桥百货商场，是商业工作中的一面红旗。一年多以前，菜市口百货商场就提出了“学天桥、赶天桥”的口号，可是始终学不好、赶不上。经过反右倾，真正在业务工作中实行了政治挂帅。仅仅一个多月的时间，就做到了过去一年多所没有做到的事情。这是多么显明的一个对比。
    我们常说，政治是统帅，思想是灵魂。有些同志原则上也承认这两句话的正确性，但在具体业务工作中却又往往忽视了这条原则。因此，各种糊涂思想不能澄清，工作干劲鼓得不足，自然就不能将各方面的积极因素调动起来。结果是尽管订下了学先进、赶先进的计划，仍然不能实现，而本单位的工作，或者仍旧是踏步不前，或者作得更坏了。菜市口百货商场过去发生过的事情就是一个很好的说明。
    现在，菜市口百货商场的全体职工在党支部领导下，已经从摸索中找到一条宽广的道路。希望他们乘胜前进，奔向更远大的前程。更希望其他与菜市口商场有类似情况的企业单位，也认真地在自己的工作中贯彻政治挂帅的方针，把工作推向一个新的高度。
