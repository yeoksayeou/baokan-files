　　High-Yielding Sow
　　One Litter of Thirty Piglets
    A sow at the Pingtou Commune Livestock Farm in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, gave birth to thirty piglets in one litter on September 20th. Each one is healthy, lively, and very adorable.
    This March, the Pingtou Commune Livestock Farm selected eight sows with strong builds, plentiful milk, good temperaments, and high conception rates from forty-two sows, as "leap forward experimental fields" for high-yield piglet production. They adopted new breeding methods such as compound mating and heat mating to increase the conception rate of the sows. The litter of thirty piglets is a "satellite" of high yield released by the "experimental field." Because there were too many piglets after the sow gave birth, and too few teats (at most sixteen), the farm distributed the remaining fourteen piglets to other sows to nurse. (Attached picture)

　　高产母猪
　　一胎三十仔
    山西陵川县平头公社畜牧场的一头母猪，在9月20日一胎就生下三十头仔猪，个个健壮活泼，非常可爱。
    今年3月，平头公社畜牧场从四十二头母猪中挑选了体格壮、奶汁多、性情好、受胎率高的八头母猪，作为多产仔猪的“跃进试验田”，采用了复配、热配的新配种方法，提高母猪的受胎率。一胎产仔猪三十头，就是“试验田”放出的一颗高产“卫星”。这头母猪分娩后因仔猪多、奶头少（最多十六个），牧场即把剩余的十四只仔猪分给了别的母猪代奶。（附图片）
