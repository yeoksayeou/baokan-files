Everlasting Combat Friendship
Wang Weizhou, Head of the Chinese Delegation of Demobilized Soldiers Visiting the Soviet Union
Guo Bingkun, Deputy Head

　　The Chinese delegation of demobilized soldiers arrived in the great friendly nation of the Soviet Union on October 15 for a visit. During its time in the Soviet Union, the delegation visited the Soviet capital of Moscow, Leningrad, the birthplace of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and Stalingrad, the heroic city of anti-fascism. During the visit, the delegation received a warm welcome and cordial reception from the Soviet Old Revolutionaries Committee, Soviet old revolutionary soldiers, and relevant parties. Party and government leaders and old revolutionary soldiers from various cities met with us amidst their busy schedules, providing us with detailed introductions to the peaceful construction of their respective cities, accompanying us on tours of the Kremlin, visiting the large-scale All-Union Economic Exhibition, viewing the full-scale models of cutting-edge scientific and technological cosmic rockets, artificial satellites, and artificial planets, touring the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station and the Lenin Canal, renowned as the world's crown jewels, paying homage to the life and legacy of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin, and visiting numerous factories, schools, shops, subway systems, historical sites, and workers' cultural palaces.
    Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, the Soviet people and old revolutionary soldiers are realizing the Seven-Year Plan with unparalleled enthusiasm, and production and construction are developing by leaps and bounds. In Moscow, we visited the "Moskvich" small car factory. In 1947, the factory's annual output was only 1,500 vehicles, but by 1958, it had reached 55,000 vehicles, with increasingly innovative models and continuously improving products. This year, production has further increased. All factory workers are working hard with full confidence to achieve even higher production targets. With the development of production, the people's material and cultural living standards are constantly improving. In Moscow, Leningrad, and Stalingrad, in the city centers and suburbs, steel tower cranes stand everywhere, constructing multi-story residential buildings, schools, sports fields, kindergartens, and other welfare facilities. A comrade from the Leningrad Municipal Party Committee told us that this year's plan is to build eight million square meters of housing, which will be provided to the people free of charge. The natural gas coming from the North Caucasus is expected to increase to 64 million cubic meters. Among Leningrad's 3.3 million people, there are 41 universities and colleges, with 100,000 students, and 457 middle schools, with 400,000 students. There are 39,000 medical workers. This fully demonstrates that the Soviet people universally enjoy a happy material life and a high level of cultural life.
    Through visits and tours, we witnessed the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union's great communist construction and the infinite wisdom and strength of the heroic Soviet people under the socialist system. The world-famous Stalingrad was once reduced to scorched earth under the fascist artillery fire of Hitler, and 1.5 tons of shrapnel were picked up per square meter in Mamaev Kurgan. Many people in capitalist countries believed that Stalingrad could not be rebuilt. But now, Stalingrad stands tall again with a brand-new and majestic appearance, with Lenin Avenue stretching 68 kilometers along the Volga River. The massive hydroelectric station and the river dam of the Lenin Canal are five kilometers long, shining brightly as the Volga River surges, millions of machines spin, and tens of thousands of tons of giant ships float. On the other side of the Volga River, just ten kilometers from Stalingrad, a brand-new industrial city has emerged, and its name is Volga. In the hands of the heroic Soviet people and old revolutionary soldiers, Stalingrad and Volga are like handsome young men and beautiful young women, radiating the light of communist youth.
    In addition to labor and study, the cultural and artistic life of the Soviet people and old revolutionary soldiers is also rich and colorful. Theaters and cinemas receive their masters with clean and magnificent appearances. The grand Labor People's Cultural Palace attracts tens of thousands of amateur enthusiasts. There we saw amateur singing groups, drama troupes, ballet troupes, dance troupes, indoor swimming pools, gymnasiums, and so on. It fully demonstrates that under the socialist system, people work happily and live happily.
    What makes us grateful is the brotherly, sincere, and noble friendship of the great Soviet people towards the Chinese people. Marshal Meleshko, Chairman of the Soviet Old Revolutionaries Committee, met with us while ill; General Khrushchev and Executive Chairman Nikitin repeatedly cared about our visits and tours; the world-famous legless flying general and current Secretary-General of the Old Revolutionaries Committee, Comrade Meresjev, took time out of his busy schedule to come to the Economic Exhibition to have meals and conversations with us; and we are also grateful to Vice Admiral Azarov and Major General Kolchikov, two old generals over sixty years old, decorated heroes, and Lieutenant Commander Rygalov from Leningrad and Colonel Selyov, Hero of the Golden Star from Stalingrad, who have always been with us. They cared about what to see, what to eat, and how to rest in a meticulous and detailed manner. Comrade Pavlichenko, the female sniper who killed 350 fascist bandits, and Comrade Litvinova, the female pilot who dropped countless tons of bombs on Hitler's bandits, cordially inquired about and cared for the situation of the old revolutionary female soldiers of China.
    From the first day the delegation arrived on Soviet soil, it was immersed in the embrace of friendship and deeply felt the warmth of the socialist family. The delegation became the distinguished guests of the Soviet people and Soviet old revolutionary soldiers wherever they went in Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, in factories, in schools, in theaters, and on the roadside. When the delegation walked on the streets, the Soviet people and Soviet elementary school students often waved and smiled at us. Like the Chinese people, the Soviet people and Soviet old revolutionary soldiers cherish the unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union and between the old revolutionary soldiers of the two countries, believing that this is a reliable guarantee for defending the socialist system and world peace. When the delegation met with Soviet old revolutionary soldiers, Soviet workers, and Soviet students, friendship, unity, and peace became a common language.
    The Soviet people and Soviet old revolutionary soldiers attach great importance to the magnificent achievements of China's construction, regarding our victory as their victory and our tenth anniversary as their important festival. When the delegation went abroad, it carried the deep affection of China's seven million demobilized soldiers for the Soviet people and Soviet old revolutionary soldiers, and when the delegation returned, it brought back the deep affection of the Soviet people and Soviet old revolutionary soldiers for the Chinese people and Chinese demobilized soldiers.
    Soviet comrades often said to us: "Great Marxism-Leninism makes us one direction, one heart. In the great cause of communism, we have formed an unbreakable friendship." Yes, in the meetings between the old revolutionary soldiers of China and the Soviet Union, we deeply recalled that on the long revolutionary journey, the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union fought against common enemies for a common revolutionary ideal, even fighting side by side on the same battlefield, and forged a combat friendship with blood. This friendship is as solid as a rock and will last forever. Under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought, the people and old revolutionary soldiers of China and the Soviet Union will forever advance side by side along the road of socialism and communism.
    Long Live the Unity of Old Revolutionary Soldiers of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship between the People of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long Live the Great Unity of the Peace-Loving People of the World! (with pictures)
    Soviet hero, legless pilot Malesiev (right) and Chinese revolutionary soldier Li Laicai meet intimately. Li Laicai also lost his legs on the Korean battlefield and is now driving a tractor and has become a labor model.
    During the Chinese delegation of demobilized soldiers' visit to Moscow, Young Pioneers in Moscow tied red scarves for them. The children shouted "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!" in Chinese! The picture shows Wang Weizhou holding a Young Pioneer.

    战斗友谊万古长青
    中国复员军人访苏代表团团长　王维舟  副团长　郭炳坤
　　中国复员军人代表团，于10月15日到了伟大的友邦苏联进行访问。代表团在苏联期间，参观访问了苏联首都莫斯科、伟大十月社会主义革命诞生地列宁格勒和反法西斯的英雄城市斯大林格勒。在访问期间，代表团受到了苏联老革命军人委员会、苏联老革命军人和有关方面的热烈欢迎和亲切的接待。各市的党政领导同志和老革命军人，在百忙中接见我们，为我们详细的介绍了各该城市和平建设的情况，陪同我们游览了克里姆林宫，参观了规模宏大的全苏经济展览会，参观了尖端科学技术宇宙火箭、人造卫星和人造行星的实体全型，参观了称为世界之冠的斯大林格勒水电站和列宁运河，瞻仰了伟大革命导师列宁的生平遗迹，以及许多工厂、学校、商店、地下铁道、文物古迹、劳动文化宫。
    苏联人民和老革命军人在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，正以无比高涨的热情，实现七年计划，生产建设飞跃发展。在莫斯科，我们参观了“莫斯科人”小型汽车工厂。1947年，这个工厂年产仅是一千五百辆，而1958年即达到五万五千辆，型号日益革新，产品精益求精。今年产量更有进一步增长。全厂职工正在信心百倍地为实现更高的生产指标而努力。随着生产的发展，人民的物质文化生活水平在不断提高。在莫斯科、列宁格勒和斯大林格勒的市内和城郊，到处钢塔吊车林立，修建着多层高楼的宿舍、学校、运动场、幼儿园等福利场所。列宁格勒的市委同志告诉我们，今年计划要新建八百万平方米宿舍，这些宿舍都是无偿的供应人民居住的。从北高加索通来的天然煤气预计要增到六千四百万立方米。在列宁格勒三百三十万人口中，有四十一座大专学校，学生达到十万人，有四百五十七座中学，学生达四十万人。有三万九千个医务工作者。这充分说明，苏联人民普遍享受着幸福的物质生活和高度的文化生活。
    通过参观和访问，我们看到了苏联伟大共产主义建设的辉煌成就和英雄的苏联人民在社会主义制度下无穷的智慧和力量。举世闻名的斯大林格勒曾在希特勒法西斯的炮火下，变成一片焦土，在玛玛耶夫冈，每平方米曾拣起一吨半炮弹片。许多资本主义国家的人，都认为斯大林格勒不可能再建设什么。可是现在的斯大林格勒，以崭新雄伟的姿态又耸立于大地，列宁大街沿伏尔加河长达六十八公里。庞大的水电站和列宁运河的河闸大坝长达五公里，随着伏尔加河的汹涌奔流，光芒万丈，千百万机器旋动，万吨巨轮浮游。在伏尔加彼岸离斯大林格勒不过十公里的地方，出现一座全新的工业城，它的名字就叫伏尔加。在英雄的苏联人民和老革命军人的手里，斯大林格勒、伏尔加，活像英俊的少年，美丽的少女，放射着共产主义青春的光芒。
    在劳动学习之余，苏联人民和老革命军人的文化艺术生活，也是丰富多彩的。戏院、电影院以整洁富丽的姿态接待着他们的主人。宏大的劳动人民文化宫，吸引着成千上万的业余爱好者。在那里我们看到了业余的歌咏团、话剧团、芭蕾舞团、舞蹈团、室内游泳场、体操场等等。充分显示了社会主义制度下人们劳动得愉快、生活得幸福。
    使我们感激的是伟大的苏联人民对中国人民那种兄弟般的真诚崇高的友谊。苏联老革命军人委员会主席米列茨科夫元帅，在病中接见了我们；赫鲁辽夫大将，尼基金执行主席数度关照我们的参观访问，举世闻名的无脚飞将军、现在任老革命军人委员会秘书长的密列席耶夫同志，在百忙中赶到经济展览馆，陪我们进餐交谈；还有使我们感激的是海军中将阿扎洛夫同志和陆军少将柯尔奇科夫同志，这两位年逾六旬的老将军、功绩累累的老英雄，和列宁格勒的海军上校略盖鲁同志、斯大林格勒金星英雄谢略夫上校，都一直是陪伴着我们。参观什么？吃什么？怎样休息？关照得细致入微。曾经击毙过三百五十名法西斯匪徒的女射击手巴甫里琴科同志，和曾向希特勒匪徒投掷过无数吨炸弹的女飞行员里脱维诺娃同志，亲切地询问和关怀着中国老革命女军人的情况。
    代表团从到苏联国土的第一天起，就投入了友谊的怀抱，深深感到社会主义大家庭的温暖。代表团在莫斯科，在列宁格勒，在斯大林格勒，在工厂，在学校，在剧院，在路旁，所到之处都成为苏联人民和苏联老革命军人的贵宾。代表团在街上行走时，苏联人民，苏联的小学生，常常招手示意，付以微笑。和中国人民一样，苏联人民，苏联老革命军人，非常珍视中苏两国人民和两国老革命军人之间的团结，认为这是保卫社会主义制度和世界和平的可靠保证。代表团在和苏联老革命军人、苏联工人、苏联学生会见时，友谊、团结、和平成为共同的语言。
    苏联人民和苏联老革命军人很重视中国建设的宏伟成就，把我们的胜利当作他们的胜利，把我们的十年大庆，当作他们的重要节日。代表团出国时，带了中国七百万复员军人对苏联人民和苏联老革命军人的深情厚意出去，代表团回来时，又带来了苏联人民和苏联老革命军人对中国人民和中国复员军人的厚意深情回来。
    苏联同志不时地对我们说：“伟大的马克思列宁主义使我们一个方向，一条心，在伟大的共产主义事业中，我们结成了牢不可破的友谊”。是的，在中苏老革命军人的会晤中，我们深切的回忆了在漫长的革命征途上，中苏两国人民和军队为着共同的革命理想，打击过共同的敌人，甚至是在一个战场并肩作战，用鲜血凝成了战斗友谊。这种友谊，坚如磐石，万古长青。中苏两国人民和两国老革命军人，在马克思列宁主义的思想指导下，永远沿着社会主义、共产主义的道路，并肩前进。
    中苏老革命军人团结万岁
