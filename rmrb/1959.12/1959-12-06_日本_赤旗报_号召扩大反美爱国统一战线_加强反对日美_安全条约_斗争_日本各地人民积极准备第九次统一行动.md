Xinhua News Agency, December 5th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's organ newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today, calling on the Japanese people to strengthen unity, expand the anti-American patriotic united front, and further expand the just struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that the eighth unified action set off a high tide of struggle across the country. During the struggle, the slogans "Immediately stop the Japan-U.S. negotiations for revising the Security Treaty" and "Oppose Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States and the signing of a new treaty" were emphasized, which was appropriate. These demands should continue to be put forward in the ninth unified action. At the same time, slogans such as "Oppose suppression" and "Oppose laws restricting demonstrations" must be added to fight to the end to safeguard the legitimate rights of the people.

"Akahata" demanded vigilance against Trotskyites using provocative "left-leaning" adventurism to undermine the unity of the democratic movement.

The editorial pointed out that Eisenhower, in a statement on the 2nd, openly expressed the U.S. attitude toward revising the "Security Treaty." At present, the United States has many bases in Japan, occupies Okinawa, and attempts to force Japan to assume the obligation of participating in the U.S.-launched wars of aggression by revising the "Security Treaty." Under these circumstances, it is completely wrong to evade the struggle against U.S. imperialism or to regard the struggle against it as secondary. When launching the ninth unified action, we must not only express opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, but also to U.S. imperialism and its agencies stationed in Japan, demanding the abolition of this treaty and the cessation of Japan-U.S. negotiations.

"Akahata" said that in order to hold the ninth unified action, political propaganda should be carried out among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life, combining the current central slogans and action slogans, and common struggle organizations against revising the "Security Treaty" should be established in smaller units and throughout the country.

The editorial emphasized that the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" is a just struggle for world peace and the interests of the Japanese nation and people. Therefore, as long as we adhere to the basic line of the national democratic united front against U.S. imperialism and Japanese traitorous monopoly capital, and carry out appropriate mass actions on this basis, we can promote the rapid advancement of democratic forces and force the U.S.-Japan reactionaries into a more unfavorable position.

"Akahata" pointed out that no matter what difficulties the just struggle of the Japanese people will encounter, as long as they work hard to develop the unity of the people as indicated by the Japanese Communist Party - the national democratic united front - no force can stop the Japanese people from achieving final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, December 5th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party held a rally at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo this afternoon to resolutely prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma, and advisor Tetsu Katayama delivered speeches to 1,500 people at this grand and enthusiastic gathering, calling for preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty," opposing the enactment of laws prohibiting demonstrations, and demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

Mosaburo Suzuki pointed out that while countries are discussing comprehensive disarmament, attempting to revise the "Security Treaty" to strengthen the Japan-U.S. military alliance is completely contrary to the trend of the world. He pointed out that Foreign Minister Fujiyama's remarks showed that the new "Security Treaty" would, under the guise of "peace in the Far East," make Japan undertake the obligation of fighting alongside the United States in the Taiwan, Vietnam, and Korean regions.

He said that opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty" is a matter of concern to Japan's country, people, and territory. We intend to go to every place in the country, every gathering, no matter how small, to make these things clear to the people.

Suzuki also condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party for enacting laws restricting demonstrations near the Diet. He said that Kishi Nobusuke once said to me that he shivers when he sees demonstrations, which clearly shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government is pursuing an anti-people policy.

Suzuki condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for adhering to a hostile policy toward China. He said that Kishi Nobusuke's insistence on not recognizing China is merely taking China as a hypothetical enemy, and in order to please the United States, he insists on maintaining the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which was forced upon Japan by the United States when the Korean War was at its most intense.

Suzuki pointed out that the Socialist Party is in the minority in the Diet, and relying solely on the forces inside the Diet cannot defeat the conservative and reactionary ruling party. Only when the masses outside the Diet rise up to fight can the ruling party be defeated.

Suzuki called on the Japanese people to strengthen their confidence, unite, and fight to the end to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty." He said, "We are determined to move forward bravely to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. The final judge is the people."

Inejiro Asanuma said in his speech that the Socialist Party will submit a resolution to the House of Representatives on the 10th, demanding the cessation of negotiations on the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Tetsu Katayama emphasized the importance of restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China. He said that in order to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, it is necessary to prevent the concrete manifestation of the hostile policy toward China - the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and further strive to abolish this treaty.

Jotaro Kawakami, an advisor to the Japan Socialist Party, said at the meeting that the Soviet Union and China have expressed their agreement that the neutrality of Japan should be guaranteed by the Soviet Union, the United States, and China. We should fight to urge the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the United States to change their foreign policy. Also speaking at the meeting were Yuzuru Akamatsu, Ritsuko Tobe, and Michiko Fujiwara of the Socialist Party. They called on the people to unite and fight against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, Tokyo Dispatch: The people of various parts of Japan, regardless of the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression, are preparing to hold the ninth national unified action against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" on the 10th. The "Central Joint Struggle Council of Youth and Students to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty" decided at its executive committee meeting today that youth and students will hold strikes and class boycotts on that day.

They also decided to protest the government's adoption of suppressive measures and demanded that member organizations strongly oppose the government's attempt to enact laws prohibiting mass demonstrations around the Diet Building.

The reports continuously received by the Central Joint Struggle Council from various places show that local organizations of joint struggle by youth and students are being rapidly established. A spokesman for the Central Conference said that joint struggle conferences have been established in five prefectures, including Nagano and Tochigi, and joint struggle conferences are also being established in cities, towns, and villages in these prefectures.

In Osaka, the Osaka Local Trade Union Council has decided to hold a conference and demonstration in the ninth unified action to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The unions of 36 private railway companies in the Kansai region have decided to mobilize 20% of the personnel on duty that day to participate in conferences and demonstrations in various places.

In Kyoto, 20,000 citizens will hold rallies at eight venues in the afternoon of the 10th, and then hold demonstrations from each venue to the Kyoto City Government.

    日本“赤旗报”号召扩大反美爱国统一战线
    加强反对日美“安全条约”斗争
    日本各地人民积极准备第九次统一行动
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本人民加强团结，扩大反美爱国统一战线，进一步扩展反对日美“安全条约”的正义斗争。
    社论指出，第八次统一行动在全国各地掀起了斗争高潮。在斗争中着重强调了“立即停止日、美为修改安全条约而举行的谈判”、“反对岸信介访问美国和签署新条约”的口号，这是合适的。这些要求在第九次统一行动中应该继续提出，同时必须加上“反对镇压”、“反对限制示威游行法律”等口号，为维护人民正当权利而斗争到底。
    “赤旗报”要求警惕托洛茨基分子以挑衅性“左倾”冒险主义来破坏民主运动的统一。
    社论指出，艾森豪威尔在2日发表谈话，公开表示了美国对修改“安全条约”的态度。目前，美国在日本拥有许多基地，霸占冲绳，并且企图通过修改“安全条约”迫使日本承担参加美国发动的侵略战争的义务。在这种情况下，如果躲避对美帝国主义的斗争，或把对它的斗争看做是次要的，这是完全错误的。在展开第九次统一行动的时候，我们不仅对岸信介内阁，而且必须对美帝国主义和它驻在日本的机关，表示反对修改“安全条约”，要求废除这项条约和停止日美谈判。
    “赤旗报”说，为了举行第九次统一行动，应该结合当前的中心口号和行动口号，向广大工人和农民以及各阶层人民展开政治宣传，在更小的单位、在全国各处都成立反对修改“安全条约”的共同斗争组织。
    社论强调指出，阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争是为世界和平以及日本民族和人民利益的正义斗争。因此，只要坚持反对美帝国主义与日本卖国垄断资本的民族民主统一战线的基本路线，并在这个基础上展开合适的群众行动，这样就能够促使民主力量迅速前进，也能够迫使美日反动派陷入更加不利的地位。
    “赤旗报”指出，不论日本人民正义的斗争将碰到怎样的困难，只要努力发展日本共产党指明的人民的团结——民族民主统一战线，任何力量都阻挡不住日本人民获得最后胜利。
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天下午在东京日比谷公会堂举行了坚决阻止修改日美“安全条约”的演讲大会。
    日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎、书记长浅沼稻次郎和顾问片山哲等人在这个盛大而热烈的集会上对听众一千五百人发表演说，呼吁阻止修改“安全条约”、反对制订禁止示威游行的法律和要求恢复日中邦交。
    铃木茂三郎指出，当各国正在商讨全面裁军的时候，企图修改“安全条约”来加强日美军事同盟的外交，是完全与世界潮流背道而驰的。他指出，藤山外务相的谈话表明，新“安全条约”将假借“为远东和平”的名义，使日本担起在台湾、越南、朝鲜地区同美国共同作战的义务。
    他说，反对修改“安全条约”，是关系到日本的国家、国民和国土的问题。我们打算到全国的每一个地方，每一个无论多么小的集会，把这些事情向人们说清楚。
    铃木还谴责岸信介政府和自由民主党制定限制在国会附近举行示威游行的法律。他说，岸信介曾经向我说，他看到游行就要发抖，这番话清楚地表明岸信介政府在执行反人民的政治。
    铃木谴责岸信介政府坚持敌视中国政策。他说，岸信介坚持不承认中国只不过是以中国为假想敌国，为了美国而要坚决维持在朝鲜战争进行最激烈的时候由美国强迫签订的日美“安全条约”。
    铃木指出，社会党在国会内是少数，光靠国会里面的力量是不能战胜保守反动的执政党的，只有国会外的群众都起来进行斗争才能战胜执政党。
    铃木号召日本人民坚定信心，团结起来为阻止修改“安全条约”而斗争到底。他说，“我们决心为打倒岸信介内阁而勇往直前。最后的审判者是国民。”
    浅沼稻次郎讲话时表示，社会党将在10日向众议院提出要求停止修改“安全条约”谈判的决议案。
    片山哲强调恢复日中邦交的重要性。他说，为了争取恢复日中邦交，必须阻止敌视中国政策的具体表现——修改日美“安全条约”，并且进一步争取废除这个条约。
    日本社会党顾问河上丈太郎在会上说，苏中两国已表示同意由苏中美三国保障日本的中立，我们应该为促使岸信介内阁和美国改变外交政策而斗争。在会上讲话的还有社会党的赤松勇、户叶里子和藤原道子。他们呼吁人民团结起来，为反对修改“安全条约”而斗争。
    据新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本各地人民不顾岸信介政府的镇压，纷纷准备在10日举行反对日美“安全条约”的第九次全国统一行动。日本“青年和学生阻止修改安全条约中央共同斗争会议”在今天举行的执行委员会会议上，决定青年和学生将在那一天举行罢工和罢课等活动。
    他们还决定，抗议政府采取镇压措施，并且要求各会员组织强烈反对政府企图制订禁止群众在国会大厦周围举行示威游行的法律。
    中央共同斗争会议不断收到的各地的汇报表明，各地目前正在迅速建立青年和学生共同斗争的地方组织。中央会议发言人说，包括长野和櫔木在内的五个县里已经建立了各县的共同斗争会议，这些县里还正在建立市、镇、村的共同斗争会议。
    在大阪，大阪地方工会评议会已经决定在第九次统一行动中举行大会和示威游行，反对修改日美“安全条约”。
    关西地区的三十六个私营铁路公司的工会决定，要动员当天出勤人员的20％参加各地的大会和示威游行。
    在京都，二万市民将在10日下午在八个会场举行奋起大会，然后由各会场向京都市政府举行示威游行。
