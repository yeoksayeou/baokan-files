Comprehensive Utilization of Wood, Development of Forest Chemical Industry
Fujian Xiqin Forest Chemical Factory Uses Indigenous Methods to Produce Various Industrial Raw Materials

Fuzhou, December 8th (Reported by our newspaper) The Xiqin Forest Chemical Factory in the suburbs of Nanping City, Fujian Province, is vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of wood with local equipment and methods. From March of this year to the present, it has produced 37.6 tons of aromatic oils, tannin extract, fiberboard, synthetic petroleum, and activated carbon.

The Xiqin Forest Chemical Factory was built last autumn. Its main products are tannin extract, fiberboard, aromatic oils, activated carbon, synthetic petroleum, synthetic cotton, and calcium acetate. These products all utilize raw materials comprehensively. For example, the aromatic oil workshop tears off pine needles from pine branches and twigs, and extracts aromatic oil (pine needle oil) through distillation; the branches and twigs stripped of needles are sent to the fiberboard workshop, chopped, soaked in lime water for a period of time, and then ground into pulp. After pre-pressing and hot-pressing, it becomes fiberboard. In the pine root comprehensive utilization workshop, pine roots are dry-distilled and fractionated to extract synthetic petroleum and wood vinegar liquor, which is processed into calcium acetate; the pine root residue, carbonized after dry distillation, can be used to make activated carbon.

The production technology of the Xiqin Chemical Factory is simple, with processes such as cutting, boiling, steaming, burning, grinding, and pressing. Of the factory's 103 employees, 34 learned plywood and fiberboard manufacturing techniques in Shanghai, and the rest were transferred from nearby state-owned logging yards, mostly family members of workers. After joining the factory, these female workers generally only need seven days to half a month to independently master the production process of one product. All the factory's equipment is very simple. The factory buildings are built with bark, bamboo, thatch, and wooden boards, costing only more than 3,000 yuan in total. They use large pots and wooden buckets to make distillers, and stone mills and water-powered pestles to replace pulping machines. In the process of learning by doing, the technical force has grown rapidly. Now, more than 80% of the factory's 113 employees can skillfully master the production technology of one to three products; at the same time, it has trained more than 300 technicians for various parts of the province.

This factory is now transitioning from indigenous to foreign, becoming a "small foreign-style group" factory. After expansion, the production capacity will reach 600 tons of fiberboard, 200 tons of tannin extract, 25 tons of activated carbon, and 5,000 tons of particleboard per year. At the same time, a lumber mill and a furniture workshop with a capacity of 15,000 cubic meters will also be newly built. The expansion and new construction projects are being accelerated, and machinery and equipment have been successively transported to the site. The main workshop – the fiberboard workshop – will be completed by the end of this year, and the rest will also be put into production next year. (Attached picture)

    综合利用木材　发展林产化学工业
    福建西芹林产化工厂用土法生产多种工业原料
    本报福州8日电　福建省南平市郊西芹林产化工厂，用土设备土办法大搞木材综合利用，从今年3月到现在，已经生产了芳香油、栲胶、纤维板、人造石油、活性炭等三十七点六吨。
    西芹林产化工厂是去年秋天建成的，主要产品是栲胶、纤维板、芳香油、活性炭、人造石油、人造棉和醋石等产品。这些产品都是实行原料综合利用的。如芳香油车间从松树枝桠上撕下松针，经过蒸馏提取芳香油（松针油）；脱净了针叶的枝桠则送到纤维板车间，切碎后用石灰水浸渍一段时间，然后磨烂成浆，经过预压和热压，就成为纤维板。在松根综合利用的车间里，把松根进行干馏和分馏，提取了人造石油和木醋液加工制成醋石；经过干馏化成炭的松根渣，又可拿去制成活性炭。
    西芹化工厂生产技术简便，有切、煮、蒸、烧、磨、压等工序。厂里的一百零三个职工，除了三十四名是在上海学习过胶合板和纤维板的制造技术外，其余都是由附近国营采伐场转调来的，大部分是工人家属。这些女工来厂后，一般只要七天到半个月，就可独立掌握一种产品的生产过程。工厂的一切设备都很简单，厂房是利用树皮、竹子、茅草和木板搭盖起来的，整个厂房一共只花了三千多元。他们用大锅和木桶制成蒸馏器，用石磨和水碓代替了打浆机。在边作边学的过程中技术力量很快成长起来了，现在全厂一百一十三个职工中已有80％以上的人能够熟练地掌握一种到三种的产品生产技术；同时还为全省各地培训了三百多个技术工人。
    这个厂现在正由土到洋过渡成为一个“小洋群”工厂。经过扩建后的生产能力将达到年产纤维板六百吨、栲胶二百吨、活性炭二十五吨、刨花板五千吨，同时还将新建一万五千立方米的制材车间和家具车间。扩建和新建工程正在加紧进行，机器设备已陆续运到现场，主要车间——纤维板车间在今年底就可建成，其余也都将在明年投入生产。（附图片）
