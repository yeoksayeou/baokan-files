An Example of Raising Pigs Quickly, Well, and Economically
—The Breeding and Management Experience of the Zhonglianchuan Production Team Pig Farm in Gongjing Commune
Tan Jingzhong, Xie Wenqun

Since its establishment in December 1956, the Zhonglianchuan Production Team Pig Farm in Gongjing People's Commune, Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, has increased its pig population from sixty to five thousand two hundred and forty-three, an increase of eighty-six times. Due to effective breeding management, this farm has not experienced any infectious diseases. Over the past three years, this pig farm has not only accumulated a large amount of fertilizer but also provided the state with more than four thousand commercial pigs, with a net income of over 27,000 yuan, becoming a red banner in the collective breeding and reproduction of pigs in Yuzhong County.

What are the experiences of the Zhonglianchuan Production Team Pig Farm in breeding and raising pigs?

Selecting Breeds, Breeding, and Raising Themselves

Strictly select good breeding pigs. The pig breeds at the Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm include three types: Zhonglianchuan pigs (also known as Erba Mei), Da Ba Mei, and Soviet Large White pigs. Among these three pig breeds, the Zhonglianchuan pig is the most suitable for local conditions, so this breed is mainly used for self-breeding and self-raising.

The requirements for selecting breeding boars are: large body size, straight back, wide back, thick snout, large ears, straight legs, two testicles of the same size, fast eating, good spirit, and strong libido. For selecting breeding sows, the standards are also large body size, long body, many and normal nipples (twelve), long and straight tail, sparse hair, easy walking, and good eating. To ensure that the pig breeds are healthy, the farm does not allow mating of sows under seven months, boars under eight months or one year, or those weighing less than sixty pounds. On average, one boar is kept for every twenty sows. The best sow started producing piglets in 1957 and has now produced seven litters, with its offspring reaching one hundred and eighty-four.

When breeding mature sows, the farm uses advanced breeding methods such as double mating, continuous mating, and heat mating. After two months of pregnancy, sows are kept in separate pens; otherwise, pregnant pigs will bite other pigs to protect their fetuses. When piglets are about to be born, the sow will start digging a nest and looking for grass; at this time, more grass should be placed in the nest. When the sow is giving birth, the breeders should be present to attend it. Each piglet is wiped clean as it's born and then placed in the sow's embrace to nurse in sequence.

If there are more piglets than milk after the sow gives birth, other sows with fewer piglets can be used to nurse them, but the farrowing dates of the two sows should not differ by more than ten days. If no other sow can be found to provide milk, the breeders should let the piglets take turns nursing from the sow. The piglets are weaned at thirty to forty days old and then raised in separate pens.

By adhering to the principle of selecting superior breeds and implementing a "self-breeding and self-raising" approach, the Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm has prevented the occurrence of infectious diseases from the breeding perspective.

Scientific Management and Careful Feeding

1. Manage Pens Separately and Feed in Groups. During the pig-raising process, the Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm found that when various types of pigs were kept in the same pen, phenomena such as estrous sows biting pregnant pigs, castrated pigs (feeder pigs) biting fattening pigs, large pigs压小猪 (crushing smaller pigs), and strong pigs bullying weak pigs often occurred. This not only caused injuries and deaths or diseases due to lacerations, but also affected the growth and fattening of the pigs. To solve this problem, they separated sows, pregnant pigs, piglets, feeder pigs, and fattening pigs for feeding and also grouped them into troughs of ten to fourteen according to size, strength, and eating speed. In this way, the phenomena of bullying, biting, crushing, and miscarriage were greatly reduced and eliminated, allowing each pig to eat well, rest well, and grow quickly.

2. Implement Five-Fixeds, Four-Cleans, and Six-No-Feeds. The pigs at the Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm not only grow fast and well, but are also managed in an orderly manner. Based on the habits of pigs, they have established a set of scientific feeding management methods:

"Five-Fixeds" means fixed person, fixed place, fixed time, fixed quantity, and fixed position.

Fixed Person: This is one of the most important measures in feeding management. Each pig, from birth to departure, is assigned to a specific person for feeding, which makes it easier for the breeder to understand and grasp the entire situation and characteristics of each pig and to manage it practically.

Fixed Place: The pig farm's feeding troughs are located in fixed places outside the pens. Feeding pigs outside the pens not only keeps the pens clean, but also increases the amount of exercise as the pigs go back and forth.

Fixed Time: The time for feeding the pigs in each pen and each trough is fixed and unchanged. This cultivates the habit of pigs automatically going out to eat in order, trough by trough, which is convenient for management and allows the pig's digestive system to function regularly.

Fixed Quantity: One of the characteristics of this pig farm's feeding is that, except for sows nursing piglets and piglets under two months old, which are fed twice a day, all other types of pigs are fed once a day, with a fixed quantity. The benefit of feeding once a day is that it can enlarge the pig's belly, promote rapid growth, and save labor. The pigs they raise are mainly fed coarse feed, and the quantity is gradually increased from less to more according to the different stages of growth and different feed intakes of various types of pigs, as follows:

         Daily Concentrated Feed  Daily Coarse Feed  Feeding Days
   Piglet  1.5 liang [75 grams]    1 jin [500 grams]    120 days
 Feeder Pig  3 liang [150 grams]    2 jin [1 kg]        120 days
Fattening Pig 1 jin [500 grams]    3 jin [1.5 kg]       60 days
 Pregnant Pig 1 jin [500 grams]   3 jin [1.5 kg]
Unpregnant Pig 4 liang [200 grams]  3 jin [1.5 kg]
    Boar  1 jin [500 grams]   3 jin [1.5 kg]

Fixed Position: When piglets start eating, they are trained to line up and position themselves according to the trough (a narrow, long wooden trough where the pig can only stick its head in). After they grow into feeder pigs, they are re-arranged and positioned according to size, strength, and eating speed, one next to the other, with fixed positions. When pigs are eating, one breeder adds and mixes feed, while correcting pigs that do not eat in their designated positions; another breeder blocks the pigs from behind, preventing them from running around or messing up the positions. After more than ten days, the pigs develop the habit of eating in their designated positions. The benefits of doing this are: the pigs do not run around or fight, they only focus on eating, saving time and not wasting feed. Before implementing fixed positions, each trough only fed three or four pigs. After fixed positions, each trough fed up to twenty or more pigs, and generally more than ten; the time was reduced from more than forty minutes per feeding to more than twenty minutes; and the breeders also felt that it was easier than before.

The so-called Four-Cleans means keeping the water clean, the troughs clean, the feed clean, and the pigs clean.

The so-called Six-No-Feeds means not feeding when it is too hot; in summer, feeding is generally done in the morning or evening; not feeding when it is too cold; in winter, feeding is changed to noon; not feeding too late, because if the feeding interval is too long, the pigs will be too hungry, eat too much, and have difficulty digesting; not feeding too early, because if you feed them before it's time, the pigs won't be hungry and will eat less; not feeding if the feed is too dry, because if it is too dry, the pigs will have difficulty digesting it; and not feeding if the feed is too thin, because if it is too thin, it won't be filling and the pigs won't gain weight.

At the Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm, pigs are re-arranged for feeding starting from the feeder pig stage. First, a portion of the feed is mixed with water into a paste, and the breeders then shout out a pleasant-sounding pig call. The pigs eat in order, trough by trough. As the pigs eat, the breeders add dry feed, mix it, and call out to them. The more evenly and quickly the mixture is stirred, the faster the pigs eat. The pig feed is generally thin at first and then thick, which ensures that the pigs eat well and are full. After the pigs have finished eating their allotted quantity, the breeders tap the mixing mallet a few times and shout, and the pigs immediately turn around and return to the pens, without lingering at the troughs or running around.

Feeding should also vary according to seasonal weather changes: in spring and autumn, the feed should be changed from thin to thick, with some dry feed added; in summer, more thin feed should be eaten and less dry feed; in winter, less thin feed should be eaten and more dry feed should be added, and the feed should be mixed with warm water after it has been boiled, so that the pigs feel warm after eating it. In spring, when the green grass grows to two inches high, the pig farm drives all the pigs except the fattening pigs and pregnant pigs to the mountains for grazing. The pigs are released from the pens every day at dawn, rest at noon, and are given a full drink of water; they can then graze for another three hours in the afternoon before being brought back to the pens. Each herd has a maximum of one hundred and twenty pigs, requiring two people, one to lead the way and the other to shout and drive them, to prevent the pigs from running too fast and to avoid too much road running. Grazing continues every year until the grass seeds mature.

3. Master the Pig's Life Cycle, Exercise Appropriately, and Pay Attention to Rest. Based on the pig's life cycle, the Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm allows the pigs to engage in necessary exercise every day. This can enhance the pig's digestive capacity, make the pig strong, and overcome the shortcomings of the "Erba Mei" pig, which has soft hooves and is not good at walking. The Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm has a walled area, and in spring and autumn, the pigs are driven to the field to exercise freely after eating. In winter, every three days, the breeders drive the pigs to walk two or three li [one to one and a half kilometers] on the road in the early morning to exercise their bodies; after returning and eating, they are driven to the upper field to bask in the sun.

Attention should also be paid to the pig's rest. In the hot summer, the pigs should not be allowed to lie together to avoid heatstroke; in the cold winter, the pigs should be allowed to squeeze together in the troughs, turning over each other to keep warm. In order to make the pigs turn over to sleep, the breeders had to direct them every night in the beginning, and after more than ten days, they became accustomed to it.

Pay Attention to Hygiene and Prevent Epidemics

In order to prevent pigs from developing infectious diseases, the Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm has implemented the prevention-oriented, treatment-assisted" and "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay" prevention and control principles. Every spring and autumn, they inject each pig with a rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine and a swine fever vaccine once each. Each breeder is an epidemic prevention worker, who understands general epidemic prevention knowledge and has also learned injection techniques, knowing the general patterns of onset and prevention of diseases. The livestock epidemic prevention departments at all levels from the county to the commune also regularly send people to help with epidemic prevention and control work. Diseased pigs are immediately isolated; imported pig breeds are also first quarantined and fed separately, and are only combined with the herd after one to two weeks of proving that there are no epidemic diseases. Pig sheds are generally located in sunny, dry, ventilated, and spacious places, swept once a day, disinfected (sprinkled with plant ash) once a week, and the nest soil is changed once a month. The size of each cave should be suitable for housing ten to fifteen pigs. The nests do not contain firewood or grass, but are covered with seven inches of fine, dry soil, which is convenient for the pigs to nest in; a circle is built outside the cave, with a pot-shaped pit dug in the middle of the circle. Every morning, the breeders wake the pigs up and drive them to the pit to urinate and defecate. This is not only convenient for cleaning the pen and field, making the pigs develop the habit of not urinating and defecating randomly, but also allows for good manure accumulation, preventing fertilizer loss.

Solve Feed Problems in Many Ways

Feed is the material basis for developing pig production. In addition to receiving some chaff grains, potatoes, oil residue, powder residue, oats and other concentrated feed, and coarse feed that can be fed to pigs from the production team, the Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm solves the bulk of its feed on its own. The main methods for solving feed are as follows:

1. Actively and effectively utilize the large quantity and variety of wild plants. The Zhonglianchuan area is vast, and wild vegetables and wild grasses are everywhere. The leaves, stems, seeds, etc. of many wild plants are not only eaten by pigs, but some pigs especially like to eat them. The pig farm harvests these wild grasses and vegetables every year, which can solve more than five months of pig feed.

2. Establish feed bases and produce high-yield crops and concentrated feed. From 1957, the production team allocated one hundred and thirty-five mu [9 hectares] of idle land and three donkeys for the pig farm to produce its own feed. This year, the breeders planted potatoes and buckwheat, etc., and have harvested more than 98,000 jin [49,000 kg] of concentrated feed and 61,000 jin [30,500 kg] of coarse feed. Recently, the team has allocated another four hundred mu [26.7 hectares] of land and seven livestock to the pig farm, preparing to expand the feed base.

3. Vigorously engage in processing. Drying, chopping, and grinding buckwheat stalks, sesame stalks, and bean stalks is a very good feed. Last year, this method was used to solve two months of pig feed.

According to the experience of the Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm, coarse feed is best烫好 (scalded) with boiling water, add a handful of concentrated feed, put it in a jar and cover tightly, and after twenty-four hours of fermentation, add concentrated feed and feed it to the pigs, who like to eat it very much. Various grass seeds are first stir-fried in a pot and then ground up to feed the pigs; otherwise, the pigs will have difficulty digesting them, and weeds will easily grow on the ground. Potatoes should be boiled (steamed), mashed, mixed into coarse feed, and then fed. Pigs are best watered with alkaline water, which not only saves sweet water (as it is dry and short of water here), but also helps digestion. If sweet water is used to water the pigs, one qian [5 grams] of salt should be added to each pig every week, so that they do not get pig lice and grow strong and healthy.

Implement "Three Guarantees" and Run the Farm Frugally

In order to strengthen the breeders' sense of responsibility and give play to their enthusiasm, the pig farm has implemented a three-guarantees-one-reward system. "Three Guarantees" means ① Guarantee the survival of piglets: the annual survival rate of piglets for sows in the current year should be fourteen, and the annual survival rate of piglets for adult sows should be eighteen; ② Guarantee the fattening quotient: it is stipulated that 114 jin of concentrated feed and 540 jin of coarse feed should produce 200 jin [100 kg] of meat (live weight); ③ Guarantee fertilizer: calculated according to the number of heads raised per month, the average annual fertilizer accumulation per pig is 12,500 jin [6,250 kg]. "One Reward" means that a reward is given for each item that exceeds the target, with a reward of 30% of the excess; those who reduce production will compensate 15% of the reduced production, and whichever item is reduced will be compensated.

The Zhonglianchuan Pig Farm's operation and management is semi-independently accounted for. Except for the breeders' work points and the labor force involved in the pig farm's capital construction participating in agricultural production dividends, all income and expenses in the farm are cost-accounted. A financial section has been established in the farm, and a financial management system has been established. The approval authority for various expenses is stipulated according to the size of the amount. Various accounts are maintained on a daily, monthly, and quarterly basis, so that nothing is missed.

This farm has consistently adhered to the principle of running the farm frugally. In production, coarse feed is used as much as possible to replace concentrated feed, and wild feed is used to replace cultivated feed; non-productive expenditures are compressed; the two farm directors participate in production and lead production; and basic construction such as sheds are carried out by the breeders in their spare time as much as possible. In the nearly three years since the establishment of the farm, the net income has reached more than 27,000 yuan. According to the statistics for the first ten months of this year, 13,800 yuan in profits have been turned over to the production team. However, their management fee expenditure for the past three years has been only 62 yuan, accounting for only 0.12% of the total income.

    多快好省养猪的一个范例
    ——贡井公社中连川生产队养猪场的饲养管理经验
    谈精忠　谢文群
    甘肃省榆中县贡井人民公社中连川生产队养猪场，从1956年12月建场以来，猪由六十口发展到五千二百四十三口，增加了八十六倍。由于饲养管理得法，这个场没有发生过传染病。三年来，这个养猪场不仅积了大量的肥料，还给国家提供了四千多口商品猪，猪场纯收入达到二万七千多元，成为榆中县集体饲养繁殖生猪事业中的一面红旗。
    中连川生产队养猪场饲养、繁殖猪的经验是什么呢？
    选种育种自繁自养
    严格选择良种种猪。中连川猪场的猪种有三种：中连川猪（又名二巴眉），大巴眉，苏联大白猪。这三种猪种中，以中连川猪最适合当地条件，因此主要采用这种猪自繁自养。
    选种公猪的要求是：体大、腰直、背宽、嘴粗、耳朵大、腿直、两蛋（睾丸）一样大、吃食快、精神好、性欲强。选留母猪，同样以体大、体躯长、奶头多而且正常（十二个）、尾巴长直、毛稀、走路自如、吃食好为标准。为了保证猪种健壮，场里对母猪不到七个月，公猪不到八个月或一年，体重不到六十斤的，不让交配。平均每二十口母猪留公猪一口。最好的一口母猪1957年开始产仔，现在已产了七窝，它的子孙已达一百八十四口。
    适龄母猪繁殖时，场里采用双重配、连续配、热配等先进配种方法。母猪怀孕两个月后，单独圈养，否则孕猪为护胎，会咬坏别的猪。快下小猪时，母猪开始挖窝和寻草，这时应给窝里多铺草。母猪在产仔时，饲养员要在旁守候，生一个小猪，擦干净一个，然后顺序放到母猪怀里吃奶。
    母猪产仔后，要是小猪多奶少，可让其它小猪少的母猪奶育，但这两个母猪的产期不能相差十天以上。如果找不到其它母猪代奶，饲养员要让小猪轮换着吃母猪的奶。小猪长到三十天到四十天的时候断奶，断奶后即分圈喂养。
    中连川猪场由于坚持了选择优良品种，实行“自繁自养”为主的方针，因而从繁殖上防止了传染病的发生。
    科学管理精心饲养
    一、分圈管理，分群喂养。中连川养猪场在养猪过程中，发现各种猪圈在一个圈里，常发生发情母猪和孕猪咬别的猪，克郎猪（架子猪）咬肥猪，大猪压小猪，强猪欺弱猪等现象，不但造成伤亡或因破伤而发生疾病，还影响猪的发育增膘。为了解决这个问题，他们把母猪、孕猪、小猪、克郎猪、育肥猪等分开喂养，又按大小、强弱及吃食快慢，每十至十四口编一槽。这样一来，就大大减少和消灭了欺咬、压死、流产等现象，使每个猪都能吃好、休息好，迅速成长。
    二、实行五定、四净、六不喂。中连川猪场的猪不但长的快，长的好，而且把猪管理得井然有序。他们根据猪的习性，建立了一套科学的喂养管理办法：
    “五定”，即定人、定地方、定时、定量、定位置。
    定人：这是饲养管理中最重要的措施之一。每口猪从出生直到离场时止，固定专人喂养，便于饲养员了解和掌握每一口猪的全部情况和特点，切合实际地进行管理。
    定地方：猪场的食槽，设在圈外固定的地方。在圈外给猪喂食，既可保持圈内清洁，猪来回往返还可增加运动量。
    定时间：那个圈那一个槽的猪什么时候吃食，都有一定的先后次序和时间，固定不变。这样，养成猪自动按次序一槽一槽出去吃食的习惯，既便于管理，又可使猪的消化系统有规律的活动。
    定量：这个猪场喂食的特点之一，就是除正在奶小猪的母猪和二个月以下的小猪每天喂两次食外，其余各类猪每天喂食一次，定量供应。喂一次的好处是：可把猪的肚子撑大，生长快，又能节省人力。他们喂养的猪，以粗饲料为主，按各类猪生长的不同阶段和不同食量，由少逐渐加多，定量如下：
          每日精饲料　每日粗饲料  喂养天数
    小猪　1.5两       　1斤　    120天
  克郎猪　3两         　2斤　    120天
  育肥猪　1斤         　3斤　     60天
  怀孕猪　1斤　         3斤
  未孕猪　4两         　3斤
  公猪　1斤　3斤
    定位：当小猪一开始吃食时，就按槽（窄长的木槽，小猪仅能把头伸进去）训练排队定位。到长成克郎猪后，按大小、强弱、吃食快慢等重新排队定位，一个挨一个，位置都固定起来。猪吃食时，一个饲养员一面添料搅拌，一面纠正不按位置吃食的猪；另一个饲养员在后边堵猪，不让猪来回乱跑或乱了位置。经过十几天后，猪就养成了按位置吃食的习惯。这样做的好处是：猪不乱跑，不咬仗，只顾低头吃食，省时间，不浪费饲料。在未实行定位置以前，每槽只喂三、四口猪。定位置以后，每槽最多喂到二十多口，一般的也喂到十多口；时间由原来每顿四十多分钟缩短到二十多分钟；饲养员还感到比原来省劲。
    所谓四净，即做到了水净、槽净、料净、猪体净。
    所谓六不喂：即太热的时间不喂，夏天喂食时间一般在早上或晚上；太冷的时间不喂，冬天喂食时间改在中午；时间太迟了不喂，喂食时间隔的太久了，猪饿的厉害，吃的多，不容易消化；时间太早了不喂，不到时候就喂食，猪不饿，吃的少；食太干了不喂，太干了猪吃了不易消化；食太稀了不喂，太稀了不耐饥，不长肉。
    中连川猪场，从克郎猪开始，就重新排队喂食。先把食料倒一部分用水拌成糊状，饲养员即吆喝起悦耳动听的唤猪声，猪按次序一槽一槽的吃，猪边吃，饲养员边添干料边搅拌，边呼唤；搅拌的越匀越快，猪也吃的越快。猪食一般是先稀后稠，这样可保证猪吃的好，吃的饱。当猪吃完定量以后，饲养员把拌食的榔头敲几下，随声一喊，猪即转身回圈，不留恋食槽或到处乱跑。
    喂食还要根据四季气候的变化而有不同：在春秋两季，吃食由稀到稠，搭些干食；夏天要多吃稀食，少吃干食；冬天少吃稀食，多搭干食，并要用开水晾温后拌食，猪吃了暖和。春天青草长到二寸高的时候，猪场除肥猪、孕猪外，把其余的猪都赶到山上放牧。每天天亮出圈，中午休息，给猪饱饮一次水；下午再放牧三小时即可收圈。放牧时每群最多一百二十口，需两人，前面一人压梢，后头一人吆赶，免得猪跑的太快，路也不宜跑的太多，每年放牧到草籽成熟时止。
    三、掌握猪的生活规律，适量运动，注意休息。中连川猪场根据猪的生活规律，每天让猪进行必要的运动。这样，可以增强猪的消化能力，使猪健壮，并可克服“二巴眉”猪蹄腿软，不善走路的缺点。中连川猪场设有用墙围起的场所，在春秋两季猪吃食后，就赶到场里让它们自由运动。冬季，每隔三天，饲养员在清晨把猪赶到大路上走两三里路，让猪活动身体；回来吃过食，再赶到上场去晒太阳。
    对猪的休息也要十分注意。夏季天热，不让猪挤在一起卧，以免中暑；冬季天冷，按槽让猪挤在一起，彼此颠倒睡，可以互相取暖。为了让猪做到颠倒睡，开始时，饲养员每天晚间要去指挥，经过十多天，也就习惯了。
    注意卫生预防疫病
    为了防止猪发生传染病，中连川养猪场贯彻了“预防为主，治疗为辅”、“土洋结合、以土为主”的防治原则。每年春季和秋季，他们给猪注射兔化弱毒疫苗和猪肺疫疫苗各一次。每个饲养员就是防疫员，都懂得一般防疫常识，也学会了注射技术，知道一般疾病的发病规律和防治方法。从县到公社的各级畜牧防疫部门，也经常派人帮助进行疫病的防治工作。发现病猪，即行隔离；引进猪种，也先进行隔离喂养，经过一至二星期，证明无疫病后再合圈。猪的棚圈一般设在向阳、干燥、通风、宽敞的地方，一天一扫除，一周一消毒（撒草木灰），每月换一次窝土。每孔窑洞的大小，以能卧十至十五口猪较为合适。窝里不放柴草，铺七寸多厚的细干土，便于猪偎窝；窑外打圈，在圈当中挖一个锅形的大坑。每天早晨饲养员把猪唤醒，赶到坑里大小便。这样，不但便于清扫圈场，使猪养成不乱便溺的习惯，而且，可以很好的积肥，免得肥料散失。
    多方下手解决饲料
    饲料是发展生猪的物质基础。中连川养猪场除从生产队领到一部分秕粮食、洋芋、油渣、粉渣、燕麦等精饲料，及可供猪食用的粗饲料外，大量的饲料还是自己解决。解决饲料的办法，主要有以下几种：
    一、积极把数量大、种类多的野生植物充分有效地利用起来。中连川地区广阔，野菜、野草到处都有，许多野生植物的叶、茎、籽等猪不但吃，而且有的猪还特别喜欢吃。养猪场每年收割这些野草、野菜，可以解决五个多月的猪饲料。
    二、建立饲料基地，生产高产作物和精饲料。从1957年起，生产队即拨出一百三十五亩闲散土地和三头驴，由猪场自己生产饲料。今年饲养员们种植了洋芋和荞麦等，已收获精饲料九万八千多斤，粗饲料六万一千多斤。最近，队里又拨给猪场四百亩地和七头牲畜，准备扩大饲料基地。
    三、大搞加工。把荞麦秆、胡麻秆和豆秆晒干铡碎后，再用磨磨细，就是很好的饲料。去年采用这个办法，解决了两个月的猪饲料。
    根据中连川猪场的经验，粗饲料最好用开水烫好，加一把精饲料，放到缸里盖严，经过二十四小时发酵后，再加精饲料喂猪，猪很喜欢吃。各种草籽在锅里先炒一下，再磨碎喂猪；否则猪吃了不容易消化，粪上到地里，也容易生杂草。洋芋要煮（蒸）熟捣烂，掺到粗饲料里再喂。猪最好饮碱水，不但可节省甜水（按这里干旱缺水），而且可以帮助消化。如果用甜水饮猪，每周也要给每口猪加食盐一钱，这样不生猪虱，而且生长健壮。
  实行“三包”勤俭办场
    为了加强饲养员的责任心，发挥饲养员的积极性，猪场实行了三包一奖制度。“三包”就是①包仔猪繁殖成活：当年母猪全年需成活小猪十四口，成年母猪全年需成活小猪十八口；②包膘分：规定每一百一十四斤精饲料、五百四十斤粗饲料产肉二百斤（活重）；③包肥料：按每月饲养头数计算，每年每口猪平均积肥一万二千五百斤。“一奖”就是超产一项奖励一项，奖给超产部分的30％；减产者赔偿减产部分的15％，哪一项减产，赔偿哪一项。
    中连川猪场的经营管理是采用半独立核算的办法，除饲养员的工分和猪场基建的劳力参加农业生产分红外，场里各项收支都进行成本核算。场内成立了财务股，建立了财务管理制度。各项开支根据数目大小，都规定了批准权限。各种账项坚持日清、月结、季公布，做到笔笔不遗，项项不漏。
    这个场一贯坚持勤俭办场的原则。生产上尽量用粗饲料代替精饲料，用野生饲料代替家生饲料；压缩非生产性的开支；两个场长都参加生产，领导生产；棚圈等基本建设，尽量由饲养员抽空进行。在建场将近三年的时间内，纯收益达二万七千多元。据今年十个月的统计，已上交生产队利润一万三千八百元。但是，三年来他们的管理费支出才六十二元，只占总收入的0.12％。
