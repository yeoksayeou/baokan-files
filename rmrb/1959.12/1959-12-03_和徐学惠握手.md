    Shaking Hands with Xu Xuehui
    Li Xue'ao
    Who says you have no hands?
    Only two arms,
    and empty sleeves.
    Who says you have no hands?
    Only bare wrists,
    skin and bones.
    Ah, you have hands!
    You have hands!
    I shook them tightly three times,
    in this most激动 (jīdòng - excited/stirred-up) moment.
    Your hands,
    as firm as steel.
    Big as a dou (斗 - traditional measuring container, about a peck).
    Gun stocks can't break them!
    Bayonets can't cut through!
    Your hands,
    as firm as steel.
    Big as a dou (斗 - traditional measuring container, about a peck).
    What are six bandits?
    The person is with the money box!
    Who dares to steal national property!
    Ah, your hands,
    everywhere on the financial front.
    I see you:
    counting banknotes with both hands,
    like water flowing smoothly;
    I see you:
    recording accounts under the lamp,
    every character so clear and neat;
    I see you:
    sliding the abacus beads on the table,
    like playing with golden balls in a silver dish.
    Ah, your hands,
    your hands,
    everywhere in the 600 million divine land.
    I see you:
    holding a gun patrolling the border,
    not letting go of a single suspicious sign;
    I see you:
    holding a pen studying in the classroom,
    every lesson getting excellent grades;
    I see you:
    flying across "1960" in the factory,
    becoming a glorious Red Banner Holder!
    Ah, the Party's good daughter,
    you have a thousand hands!
    You have ten thousand hands!
    Every pair harder than steel.
    Every pair bigger than a dou.
    I hold them tightly,
    a thousand words surging in my throat!

    和徐学惠握手
    李学鳌谁说你没有手？只有两只胳臂，和空空的袖口。谁说你没有手？只有光秃秃的腕子，皮包骨头。啊，你有手！你有手！我紧紧地握了它三次，在这最激动的时候。你的手，坚如钢。大如斗。枪托砸不破！刺刀砍不透！你的手，坚如钢。大如斗。六个匪徒算什么？人在钱箱在！谁敢把国家财产抢走！啊，你的手，金融战线上处处有。我看见你：双手点着钞票，像水一样顺流；我看见你：在灯下记着账簿，字字那么清秀；我看见你：在桌上拨着算子，像银盘中拨弄金球。啊，你的手，你的手，六亿神州处处有。我看见你：握枪在边防线上巡逻，不把一点疑象放走；我看见你：握笔在课堂上学习，课课都得优秀；我看见你：在工厂里飞跨“1960年”，当了光荣的红旗手！啊，党的好女儿，你有千双手！你有万双手！双双比钢硬。双双大过斗。我紧紧握着它，千言万语涌嗓口！
