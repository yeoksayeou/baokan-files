Xinhua News Agency, London, 23rd: The British Communist Party issued a statement on the 21st regarding the proposal by the heads of government of the four Western countries to hold a top-level East-West meeting, stating: "In order to make the top-level meeting a success, we need vigilance and action."
	The statement pointed out that this was a "step taken after a long delay." The statement said, why did it take so long? Because those who oppose peace and peaceful coexistence have been and still are working to hinder this step. The statement pointed out that just before the Western summit, the North Atlantic Group countries also held a meeting in Paris to prepare a ten-year plan to intensify the Cold War and expand nuclear weapons bases.
	The statement said that Macmillan may have talked about the desire to ease international tensions; but when his Defense Minister Watkinson flew to Paris to talk about negotiations only from a position of strength, he used the familiar language of the Cold War.
	The statement pointed out that while proposing to convene a summit meeting, the heads of the three Western countries, in accordance with Adenauer's wishes, adopted an unyielding attitude on the Berlin issue.
	Most importantly, West Germany is being rearmed with nuclear weapons. This is a great threat to peace. This is especially dangerous for Britain.
	The statement said that in the four months from now until the summit meeting is held, the issue of rearming West Germany with nuclear weapons may become a fait accompli.
	The statement emphasized the urgency of preventing the rearmament of Nazism with nuclear weapons and stopping further nuclear tests. The statement then said: "These urgent outstanding issues show that now is not the time to relax vigilance, but to increase vigilance and take action."
	The statement called on the people to step up actions such as rallies, marches, and petitions to promote a result of the summit meeting that is conducive to peace and disarmament.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd: "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today on the results of the Western countries' summit in Paris, saying that the strong demands of the people of the world have forced the leaders of Western countries to agree to hold a summit meeting between East and West, but at the Paris meeting they "clearly showed that they still want to conduct talks from a position of ‘strength’, they do not want to take off the shell of outdated policies, and... they are insidiously planning to obstruct the success of the meeting."
	The commentary said: "The most important purpose of the Western countries' meeting this time is to ‘strengthen’ their position before the East-West summit, first of all to ‘adjust’ the contradictions between them and take ‘unified steps’."
	The commentary concluded by saying that from the "summit meeting of Western countries, it can be seen that peace-loving people must be vigilant against the 'Cold War' clamorers and must firmly grasp the cause of peace in their own hands."
	A commentary in "Democratic Korea" said: "Whether the East-West summit meeting to be held in the future can achieve success depends entirely on how the Western powers treat reality with a rational stance and how much sincerity they show in ending the ‘Cold War’ and fulfilling peaceful coexistence. The peace-loving people of the world will never be intimidated by the bluster of the Western powers, nor can they allow the vicious plots of the imperialist warmongers who clamor for the 'Cold War'."

　　英共就西方同意举行东西方高级会议发表声明
    必须警惕西方加紧备战的阴谋
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”斥西方策划阻挠高级会议取得成就
    新华社伦敦23日电　英国共产党21日就西方四国政府首脑关于举行东西方最高级会议的建议发表声明说：“为了使最高级会议开得成功，我们需要警惕和行动”。
    声明指出，这是一个“迟迟才采取的步骤”。声明说，为什么要这么久呢？因为反对和平和和平共处的人一直在而且仍然在努力阻碍采取这个步骤。声明指出，就在西方首脑会议之前，北大西洋集团国家也在巴黎举行会议，准备制订一个加紧冷战和扩大核武器基地的十年计划。
    声明说，麦克米伦可能谈到缓和国际紧张局势的愿望；可是当他的国防大臣沃金森飞往巴黎谈到只能从实力地位出发进行谈判的时候，用的却是人们熟知的冷战语言。
    声明指出，在提出召开最高级会议的建议的同时，西方三国首脑按照阿登纳的意愿在柏林问题上采取了顽固不化的态度。
    最重要的是，西德正在用核武器重新武装起来。这是对和平的极大威胁。这对英国说来尤其危险。
    声明说，从现在起到召开最高级会议时的今后四个月中，以核武器重新武装西德的问题就可能成为既成的事实。
    声明着重指出阻止用核武器重新武装纳粹主义和阻止继续进行核试验的迫切性。声明接着说：“这些急迫的悬而未决的问题说明，现在不是放松戒备的时候，而是提高警惕和采取行动的时候。”
    声明号召人民加紧采取集会、游行和请愿等行动，以促使最高级会议获得有利于和平和裁军的结果。
    新华社平壤23日电　“劳动新闻”今天就在巴黎举行的西方国家首脑会议的结果发表评论说，全世界人民的强有力的要求使西方国家领导人不得不同意举行东西方首脑会议，但是，他们在巴黎会议上“明显地表明，他们仍然要站在‘实力地位’的立场上来进行会谈，不想脱掉陈旧政策的外壳，……为阻挠会议取得成就进行着阴险的策划。”
    评论说：“这次举行的西方国家会议的最主要的目的是为了在东西方首脑会议之前，‘加强’他们的立场，首先要‘调整’他们之间的矛盾，采取‘统一步骤’。”
    评论最后说，从“西方国家首脑会议可以看出爱好和平的人民必须对‘冷战’叫嚣者提高警惕，必须把和平事业牢固地掌握在自己手里。”
    “民主朝鲜报”的评论说：“今后召开的东西方首脑会议能否取得成就，完全在于西方大国如何以理智的立场对待现实，对结束‘冷战’、履行和平共处表示多少诚意。全世界爱好和平的人民决不会被西方大国的虚张声势所吓倒，也决不能容许叫嚣‘冷战’的帝国主义好战分子的恶毒的策划。”
