    New Uses for Slag
    In the past, when our factory used indigenous iron to make steel, the slag was discarded because the indigenous iron had a high sulfur content, and we used the soda ash external desulfurization method. Later, everyone discovered that the slag had a high alkalinity, so, encouraged by the Party branch, we studied its recycling. After continuous experimentation, it was indeed turned into a "treasure" for the textile and paper industries. For example, the Tangshan Chemical Plant uses it to recover soda ash, with a recovery rate of over 80%. The paper mill has used it to replace caustic soda for bleaching, and the Tangshan Textile Mill also uses it, after slight causticization, to replace caustic soda for scouring white cloth. This not only reduced costs, but also increased the efficiency of dyeing cloth by more than double; the whiteness is even better than using pure caustic soda, which is very popular with workers. At first, everyone called it "indigenous alkali," but now everyone calls it "universal penetrating agent."

    炉渣的新用途
    过去我厂使用土铁炼钢的时候，由于土铁含硫较高，就采用碱面炉外脱硫办法，炉渣都被扔掉。后来，大家发现渣中含碱度很高，于是就在党支部的鼓励下研究回收，经过不断地试验，果然把它变成了纺织、造纸工业的“宝贝”了。例如唐山化工厂用它回收碱面，回收率达到80％以上，造纸厂已用它代替了火碱脱色，唐山纺织厂还用它稍加苛化后代替火碱煮炼白布。这样做，不但降低了成本，而且提高了染布的工作效率一倍以上；洁白度比起使用纯火碱来还白，很受工人的欢迎。起初大家叫它为“土碱”现在大家称它为“万能渗透剂”了。
