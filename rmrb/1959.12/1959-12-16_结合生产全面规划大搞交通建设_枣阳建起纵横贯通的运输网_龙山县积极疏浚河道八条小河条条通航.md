Combining Production with Overall Planning to Vigorously Develop Transportation Construction
    ZaoYang Builds a Transportation Network Running Through and Through
    Longshan County Actively Dredges River Channels, All Eight Small Rivers Navigable
    (Reported by this newspaper) Hubei Province's ZaoYang County closely integrates with agricultural production, mobilizing the masses to vigorously develop transportation construction. Over the past year, the county has built 6,134 highways and avenues, totaling 7,112 kilometers in length. Currently, all 14 communes, 76 management districts, and 569 production teams in the county have basically achieved access to automobiles for each team, horse-drawn carriages for each village, and handcarts for the fields, forming a transportation network running through and through. This not only facilitates current short-distance transportation but also prepares favorable conditions for future agricultural mechanization.
    ZaoYang County is located in a hilly area. In the past, except for a highway from Qingtan Town to the county seat that could barely accommodate automobiles, most of the other roads were narrow paths, making transportation very inconvenient. Starting in the autumn of last year, the ZaoYang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, while striving for a bumper harvest in agricultural production, mobilized the masses to comprehensively reform transportation, integrating transportation construction with garden-style fields, agricultural mechanization, and the long-term vision of new rural construction, considering both the present and the future. They divided road construction into four levels: main lines, branch lines, field operation roads, and pedestrian paths. Highways from communes to the county seat and between communes were designated as main lines, and highways from communes to management districts as branch lines. These highways serve as the baselines of the transportation network, allowing the passage of automobiles. Field operation roads allow for the smooth passage of ox carts and horse-drawn carriages. Field operation roads and pedestrian paths are perpendicular or parallel to the baselines. The areas between the four lines are connected to form continuous fields. The ZaoYang County Committee also centrally arranged transportation construction with agricultural production as the center, first determining transportation routes, reserving the roadbed for main lines during deep plowing, and carrying out comprehensive construction in conjunction with large-scale land consolidation and garden-style fields. The close integration of transportation construction and agricultural production not only did not affect agricultural production but also promoted it.
    ZaoYang County has gained greatly through comprehensive planning and vigorous development of transportation construction. First, it has saved land and expanded the planting area. In the past, Taiping Commune had more than 3,900 roads of various sizes, occupying more than 20,000 mu of land. After comprehensive planning, it built eight highways, 96 avenues, and 93 field operation roads, occupying only more than 12,000 mu of land. The county saved a total of more than 40,000 mu of land. Second, it has saved labor. Last year, the task of storing 124 million jin of grain in the warehouse was carried out by manual labor, taking five months. This year, the task of storing 152 million jin of grain in the warehouse was completed in 40 days because there were highways and the realization of vehicle transportation, saving more than one million labor days compared to manual labor. Third, it has accelerated the turnover of materials and supported industrial and agricultural production. In July of this year, when cotton was growing vigorously, more than 20,000 mu of cotton fields in Taiping Commune suffered from insect pests, and more than 3,000 mu of third-class seedlings urgently needed pesticides and fertilizers. Due to convenient transportation, the commune transported back more than 36,000 jin of pesticides and fertilizers in one day, ensuring a bumper cotton harvest. Fourth, shortening the mileage of roads after comprehensive planning has saved a lot of material and financial resources. The distance from the county seat to the commune has been generally shortened by 10% to 30% after comprehensive planning. This year, a large amount of gasoline has been saved by transporting grain by car.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 15th) Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the people of Longshan County, Hunan Province, have overcome various difficulties to dredge six small rivers, changing the backward face of transportation in the mountainous area. Now, all eight small rivers within the county, totaling 185 kilometers in length, are navigable. The county has established a shipping professional team with 250 boats, and nearly half of the communes have access to boats.
    Since the Great Leap Forward last year, industrial and agricultural production has developed rapidly, and the volume of transportation has greatly increased. Automobiles could not transport everything, and the county had an inventory backlog of tens of thousands of tons. According to this situation, the Longshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan "Materials go down the river," and extracted the deputy director of the Industry and Transportation Work Department of the County Committee, the deputy county head, and the transportation section chief to form a river repair leading group, established a river repair office, and led the masses to repair and dredge river channels on a large scale using a method of public-private partnership. During the winter of last year and the summer drought this year, the method of repairing and transporting simultaneously, repairing one section and opening one section was adopted, making the six Xiaoxi Rivers with narrow riverbeds, many rocks, and dry water, totaling 130 kilometers in length, navigable one after another. The commune members along the river enthusiastically praised: "Chaotic rock ditch, chaotic rock ditch, it used to be a snake-raising ditch; today we have the Communist Party, and the rock ditch has become a dragon boat ditch. In the past, there was no boat to cross the river ditch, and it was hard to carry it on shoulders and backs; today, the river ditch is connected to boats, and there is no need to worry about transporting goods and grain."
    Longshan County followed the characteristics of mountainous areas, fully utilized small river shipping, and received a number of benefits: because small rivers are widely distributed, traffic dead ends were eliminated, and the task of short-distance concentration and transportation was completed; the burden of highway transportation was reduced; because of the large-scale repair of small rivers and the construction of dams to block water, water conservancy construction was promoted, and the irrigated area was expanded. In addition, sixteen oil presses and mills were established along the river using hydropower. (Attached image)

    结合生产全面规划大搞交通建设
    枣阳建起纵横贯通的运输网
    龙山县积极疏浚河道八条小河条条通航
    本报讯　湖北省枣阳县紧密结合农业生产，发动群众大搞交通建设。一年来，全县兴修了六千一百三十四条公路和大道，全长七千一百一十二公里。现在，全县十四个公社、七十六个管理区、五百六十九个生产队，基本上实现了队队通汽车，庄庄通马车，田间通板车，构成了纵横贯通的交通网。这样既便利了当前的短途运输，又为以后农业生产机械化准备了有利条件。
    枣阳县地处丘陵地带，过去除清潭镇到县城有一条公路勉强通行汽车外，其他道路大部分是羊肠小道，交通非常不便。中共枣阳县委从去年秋天开始，在夺取农业生产大丰收的同时，就发动群众着手全面改革交通运输，把交通建设同园田化、农业生产机械化和新农村建设远景一并规划，既考虑现在，也考虑将来。他们把道路建设划分为四个等级，即：主干线，支干线，田间作业道，人行道。公社到县城、公社和公社之间的公路为主干线，公社到管理区的公路为支干线，这些公路作为交通网的基线，可以通行汽车。田间作业道，能畅通牛车、马车。田间作业道和人行道同基线垂直或平行。四线交叉之间田园连片。枣阳县委还以农业生产为中心来统筹安排交通建设，先确定交通路线，在深翻地时就留出主干线路基，在大搞土地连片园田化时就结合进行全面施工。交通建设和农业生产的紧密结合，不但没有影响农业生产，还促进了农业生产。
    枣阳县通过全面规划大搞交通建设，收获很大。第一，节约了土地，扩大了播种面积。太平公社过去大小道路三千九百多条，占地两万多亩，全面规划以后，修了八条公路、九十六条大道、九十三条田间作业道，只占地一万二千多亩。全县共节约土地四万多亩。第二，节约了劳力。去年全年粮食入库任务一亿二千四百万斤，肩挑人担，前后花费了五个月的时间。今年粮食入库任务一亿五千二百万斤，因为有了公路，实现了运输车子化，前后四十天就完成了任务，比肩挑人担节约了一百多万个劳动力。第三，加速物资周转，支援了工农业生产。今年7月棉花生长正旺时，太平公社有两万多亩棉田遭受虫害，同时有三千多亩三类苗，急需农药、化肥。由于交通方便，一天这个公社就运回农药、化肥三万六千多斤，保证了棉花的丰收。第四，道路缩短里程以后，节约了大量的物力、财力。县城到公社的路程，经全面规划以后，普遍缩短10％到30％。今年汽车运粮就节约了大量汽油。
    据新华社长沙15日电　湖南省龙山县人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，战胜种种困难疏通六条小河，改变了山区的交通闭塞的面貌。现在，全县境内长达一百八十五公里的八条小河已条条通航。这个县目前已建立起一支拥有二百五十条船只的航运专业队，约有半数的公社都通船了。
    去年大跃进以来，工农业生产飞跃发展，运输量大大增加，汽车运不过来，全县积压物资达十来万吨。中共龙山县委根据这种情况，提出了“物资下河”的口号，并且抽出县委工业交通工作部副部长、副县长、交通科长组成修河领导小组，成立修河办公室，以民办公助的办法，领导群众大规模地修浚河道。在去年冬季和今年夏季抗旱的时候，采取边修边运、修一节通一节的办法，使河床狭小、岩多水枯的六条长达一百三十公里的小溪河，先后通航。沿河一带的社员热情地歌颂道：“乱岩沟来乱岩沟，过去是个养蛇沟；今天有了共产党，岩沟变成龙船沟。过去河沟无船渡，肩挑背驮苦到头；今天河沟通了船，运货运粮不要愁。”
    龙山县按照山区特点，充分利用小河航运，收到了一举数得的好处：由于小河分布面广，消灭了交通死角，完成了短途集运任务；减轻了公路运输负担；由于大修小河、筑坝堵水，促进了水利建设，扩大了灌溉面积。此外，沿河一带还利用水力建立了油榨、碾坊十六座。（附图片）
