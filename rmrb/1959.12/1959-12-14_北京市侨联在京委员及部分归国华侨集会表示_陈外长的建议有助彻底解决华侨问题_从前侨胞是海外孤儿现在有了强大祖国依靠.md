Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The Beijing Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Members and some returned Overseas Chinese, totaling more than 30 people, gathered on the 12th to firmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's proposal on comprehensively resolving the Overseas Chinese issue. They expressed extreme indignation at Indonesia's rampant anti-Chinese activities and heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the Indonesian Overseas Chinese who have been subjected to unwarranted persecution. They also expressed their welcome to those Overseas Chinese who are displaced or unwilling to continue residing in Indonesia to return to the powerful motherland and participate in socialist construction.

The attending members and returned Overseas Chinese unanimously believed that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's proposal fully demonstrates the Chinese government's major effort, proceeding from the desire to safeguard the friendly aspirations of China and Indonesia, to thoroughly resolve the Overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries once again. They believed that only with a strong motherland can this reasonable and comprehensive solution to the Overseas Chinese issue be proposed. Huang Pizhen, who resided in Indonesia for more than 30 years, returned to the motherland at the beginning of this year, and is now working in the Ministry of Agriculture, said that he and some other Overseas Chinese had been persecuted more than once in Indonesia. Their schools were forcibly requisitioned as barracks, and students were ordered to stop attending school, which severely affected the students' studies and the teachers' lives. He said with great emotion that in the past, Overseas Chinese were overseas orphans, and only the motherland under the leadership of the Communist Party can become the reliance of Overseas Chinese. The third point of the proposal in Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter is sufficient to show that the thriving motherland has opened its warm embrace to those Overseas Chinese in Indonesia who have no means of livelihood.

Wu Shihuan, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia and a lecturer in the Department of Eastern Languages at Peking University, pointed out that the current anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia are being carried out under the pretext of "developing the national economy." In fact, the Overseas Chinese economy has been formed along with the development of the Indonesian national economy, and it has become an integral part of the Indonesian economy, which is beneficial to the development of the Indonesian economy. Huang Fukun, a member of the Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a worker at the Beijing Comprehensive Instrument Factory, and Li Mei, a member of the Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a returned Overseas Chinese from Jakarta, both used their personal experiences to illustrate the flesh-and-blood friendship between the Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people and the contributions made by the Overseas Chinese to Indonesia's economic development. Huang Fukun said that in Indonesia, the Overseas Chinese worked hard with the Indonesian people to open up barren mountains and made effective contributions to the construction of this country. He said that even the small vendors who are now being persecuted play a positive role in supplying the needs of the local people and enlivening local commodity circulation with their labor and small-scale businesses. Li Mei said excitedly: I have lived in Indonesia for more than 40 years and deeply understand that there is a long history of cooperation between the Indonesian people and the Overseas Chinese. The sorrows and joys of the Overseas Chinese working people are also the sorrows and joys of the vast Indonesian people. Now, a small number of elements in Indonesia who are hostile to the friendship between China and Indonesia are actually slandering the Overseas Chinese as a "fifth column" and slandering the Overseas Chinese economy as a "colonial economy," which is really intolerable. Xie Nanguang, a deputy to the National People's Congress and a member of the Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said: The result of Indonesia's forced relocation of Overseas Chinese small vendors can only be to shoot themselves in the foot. According to reports, the exchange between urban and rural areas in some parts of Indonesia has been greatly affected, and prices have risen several times a day. He said that if they are really for the development of the national economy, then why not make good use of the Overseas Chinese economy to develop national industry and commerce, and why don't they dare to touch the imperialist colonial economy that seriously affects the Indonesian national economy?

At the forum, the members excitedly talked about the fact that today Indonesia is rampant in its anti-Chinese activities, but the powerful motherland has the full power to solve the Overseas Chinese issue. They said that in the past, the working people under the reactionary government could not live and had to leave their homes and seek a living abroad; now the motherland is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, and socialist construction needs more labor. Everyone unanimously expressed their welcome to the displaced Overseas Chinese or those who are unwilling to continue residing in Indonesia to return to the embrace of the motherland. Luo Haocai, a member of the Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a student in the Department of Law at Peking University, said that 200 Overseas Chinese students at Peking University expressed great indignation at Indonesia's rampant anti-Chinese activities. He said that we must never tolerate our compatriots being persecuted overseas. The Overseas Chinese want to return, and the country needs construction talents in all aspects. Luo Haocai used the example of Peking University to powerfully illustrate that the returned Overseas Chinese are full of bright prospects in the motherland. He said that some of the 200 Overseas Chinese students at Peking University had no opportunity to study in the past, but now they are studying in a nationally renowned university, and students with economic difficulties have also received state scholarships to help them study with peace of mind. He said that in the past few years, returned Overseas Chinese students have made rapid progress in politics and studies. In this year's "May Fourth" period alone, 19 Overseas Chinese students were commended by the school. Luo Haocai said that we returned Overseas Chinese warmly welcome the displaced Overseas Chinese or those who are unwilling to continue residing in Indonesia to return to the motherland and participate in the socialist construction of the motherland with us.

    北京市侨联在京委员及部分归国华侨集会表示
    陈外长的建议有助彻底解决华侨问题
    从前侨胞是海外孤儿现在有了强大祖国依靠
    新华社13日讯　北京市侨联在京委员及一部分归国华侨共三十多人12日集会，坚决拥护陈毅外交部长关于全面解决华侨问题的建议，对于印度尼西亚猖狂的排华活动表示十分愤慨，对于遭到无端迫害的印度尼西亚华侨表示衷心的同情和慰问，并表示欢迎那些流离失所或不愿继续在印度尼西亚居留的华侨，回到强大的祖国参加社会主义建设。
    到会的全体委员和归国侨胞一致认为，陈毅外交部长的建议充分表明我国政府从维护中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好愿望出发，为彻底解决存在于两国之间的华侨问题，又一次作出了重大的努力。他们认为，只有祖国强大，才能提出这合情合理的全面解决华侨问题的办法。侨居印度尼西亚三十多年、今年年初回到祖国现在在农业部工作的黄丕振说，他在印度尼西亚时和其他一些华侨曾经不止一次地受到过迫害。他们的学校被强征做了兵营，学生被限令停止上学，致使学生的学习和教师的生活都受到严重的影响。他十分激动地说，过去我们华侨都是海外孤儿，只有共产党领导下的祖国才能成为华侨的依靠。陈毅外交部长信中所提出的第三点的建议，足以说明欣欣向荣的祖国向那些在印度尼西亚无以为生的侨胞们敞开了温暖的怀抱。
    印度尼西亚归侨、北京大学东语系讲师吴世璜指出目前印度尼西亚的排华活动，是在所谓“发展民族经济”的借口下进行的。事实上华侨经济是随同印度尼亚西民族经济的发展而形成的，它已经成为印度尼西亚经济的一个组成部分，对印度尼西亚经济的发展是有益的。市侨联委员、北京市综合仪器厂工人黄福昆和市侨联委员、雅加达归侨李梅等都以切身的经历来说明华侨与印度尼西亚人民的血肉友谊和华侨对印度尼西亚经济发展所作的贡献。黄福昆说，在印度尼西亚华侨是和印度尼西亚人民一起开辟荒山、辛勤劳动，为这个国家建设作出了有效的贡献。他说，就是现在受着迫害的小商小贩，他们的劳动和小本经营对于供应当地人民需要、活跃当地商品流通也起着积极作用。李梅激动地说：我侨居印度尼西亚四十几年，深深了解印度尼西亚人民和华侨之间有着长期合作的历史。华侨劳动人民的悲哀、喜悦也就是印度尼西亚广大人民的悲哀、喜悦，现在印度尼西亚少数敌视中国和印度尼西亚友谊的分子竟然诬蔑华侨是“第五纵队”，诬蔑华侨经济为“殖民主义经济”，实在令人不能容忍。全国人民代表大会代表、市侨联委员谢南光说：印度尼西亚逼迁华侨小商小贩的结果，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。据报载，现在印度尼西亚部分地区的城乡交流已经受到很大的影响，货价也一日数涨。他说，如果他们真正为发展国民经济，那又为什么不好好利用华侨经济，来发展民族工商业，为什么不敢触动真正严重影响印度尼西亚民族经济的帝国主义的殖民经济呢？
    在座谈会上，委员们兴奋地谈到，今天印度尼西亚猖狂排华，然而强大的祖国完全有力量来解决华侨问题。他们说，过去反动政府统治下劳动人民无法生活，不得不离乡背井，出外谋生；现在祖国日益繁荣富强，社会主义建设需要更多的劳动力。大家一致表示欢迎流离失所或不愿继续留居印度尼西亚的侨胞回到祖国的怀抱。市侨联委员、北京大学法律系学生罗豪才说，北京大学二百名华侨学生，对印度尼西亚猖狂的排华活动表示十分愤慨。他说，我们决不能容忍我们的同胞在海外遭受迫害，华侨要回来，国家正需要各方面的建设人材。罗豪才以北大的例子有力地说明了华侨回到祖国是充满着光明的前途的。他说，北大二百名华侨学生，有的过去根本没有书念，现在却在全国有名的大学就学，经济困难的同学还得到了国家的助学金，使他们安心学习。他说，几年来，归国华侨学生在政治上、学习上，都有了很快的进步，仅今年“五四”时，学校就有十九个华侨同学受到表扬。罗豪才说，我们归侨十分欢迎流离失所或不愿继续留居印度尼西亚的侨胞回到祖国，和我们一起参加祖国的社会主义建设。
