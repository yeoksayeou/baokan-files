Mutual Assistance Becomes a Habit
Yi Qin

Dear readers, let us carefully read the news about the prevailing atmosphere of mutual assistance on all fronts in Gansu Province! This is an inspiring ode to communist spirit. Through it, we see that the millions of people in Gansu Province are truly united. They support each other, promote each other, and everyone has only one common belief: "For the common cause."

"The common cause," this noble phrase, with the development of our entire socialist construction, has increasingly become a driving force to encourage the broad masses to move forward. Countless facts in the Great Leap Forward have made it increasingly clear to people that any work we are doing is a link in the entire chain of cooperation. Each link is not only working for itself, but also working for other links and for the entire chain. The better each link works, the better the entire chain works. At the same time, people have also seen that in the continuous Great Leap Forward, the relationship between links, and between links and the chain, has become closer. Because, with the continuing leap forward, production requirements are getting higher and higher, the scope of production is getting wider and wider, the division of labor is getting more and more detailed, and there are more and more links. With higher requirements and more links, the cooperative relationship between links and links, and between links and the chain, must have new developments. That is to say, the scope of cooperation will become wider and wider, the number of cooperative projects will increase, and the forms of cooperation will become more diverse. Isn't this the case in Gansu Province? They not only have a prevailing atmosphere of mutual assistance on all fronts of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military, unfolding comprehensive large-scale cooperation that is unafraid of difficulties and regardless of compensation, but also provide support for any item, regardless of its size. Taking the industrial construction system as an example, from machinery and equipment, human resources and technology, raw materials, to blueprint design, they have whatever is needed, and give whatever is asked for.

According to the experience of Gansu Province, this cooperative relationship must be built on the basis of communist consciousness. The party organizations in Gansu Province always pay attention to conducting socialist and communist ideological education to the people at any time and any place, and commend advanced units with communist spirit in mutual support at various meetings. While carrying out positive education, they also waged a struggle against departmentalism. Only through such profound ideological education can people's communist consciousness be continuously improved, and people's overall concept be continuously strengthened. In this way, the policy of "the whole country as a chessboard" is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, achieving the subordination of local interests to overall interests, and the subordination of temporary interests to long-term interests. In this way, a prevailing atmosphere of mutual assistance has emerged throughout the province, pushing our socialist construction forward at a faster speed.

    互助成风

    亲爱的读者，让我们仔细读一读甘肃省各个战线互助成风的消息吧！这是一篇振奋人心的共产主义风格的赞歌。通过它，我们看到了甘肃省千万人民的千万颗心真正连成了一条心。他们互相支援，互相促进，大家只有一个共同的信念：“为了共同的事业”。
    “共同的事业”，这个高尚的词句，随着我们整个社会主义建设事业的发展，越来越深刻地成为鼓舞广大群众前进的动力。大跃进中的无数事实，使人们越来越清楚地看到：我们在进行的任何一项工作，都是整个协作链条上的一个环节，每一个环节不仅是为自己工作，同时也都在为别的环节工作，也在为整个链条工作。每个环节工作得越好，整个链条也就工作得更好。同时，人们也看到了：在不断跃进当中，环节和环节，环节和链条之间的关系也更加密切起来。因为，随着继续跃进的形势，生产要求越来越高，生产范围越来越广，分工越来越细，环节越来越多。要求高了，环节多了，环节和环节、环节和链条之间的协作关系必须要有新的发展。也就是说协作范围就会越来越广，协作项目越来越多，协作形式也更加多种多样。甘肃省不就是这样的吗？他们不仅在工、农、商、学、兵各个战线上互助成风，展开了不怕困难，不计报酬的全面大协作，而且在支援的项目上也是不管巨细，都在支援之列。以工业建设系统为例，从机械设备、人力技术、原材料，直至图纸设计，要啥有啥，要啥给啥。
    根据甘肃省的经验，这种协作关系必须建立在共产主义觉悟的基础上。甘肃省党的组织随时随地注意向人们进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育，在各种会议上表扬了在互相支援问题上具有共产主义风格的先进单位。在进行正面教育的同时，又对本位主义思想进行了斗争。只有经过这样深刻的思想教育，才会使人们的共产主义觉悟不断提高，才会使人们的整体观念不断加强。这样，就使得“全国一盘棋”的方针深入人心，做到局部利益服从整体利益，暂时利益服从长远利益。这样，就在全省范围内出现了互助成风的局面，把我们的社会主义建设事业以更快的速度推向前进。
