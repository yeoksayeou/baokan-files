　　Innovation Knows No End, Potential is Limitless
    Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory Launches Technical Innovation Drive to Ensure an Active and Reliable Plan for Next Year
    (Our newspaper Chongqing, 28th dispatch) The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, in its ongoing production preparation work, is launching a mass technical innovation and revolution campaign focusing on "Three-izations" (high-speed, mechanization, automation) and "Four Improvements" (improving processes, improving tools, improving designs, improving equipment) to address the difficulties of labor shortages, raw material shortages, and insufficient transportation capacity due to the return of apprentices trained for other factories to their original positions, resulting in a significant reduction in personnel. This is to ensure a strong start to the new year and to achieve continued overall leap forward.
    The factory's production target for next year is 46.5% higher than this year without increasing personnel. Completing this task presents considerable difficulties. After careful analysis of the situation in the enterprise, the factory's Party committee proposed a large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution campaign, actively embarking on mechanization, automation, and high-speed operations, and vigorously improving tools, designs, and equipment. In early December, the factory established a Technical Revolution Committee, headed by the Party Secretary, and included veteran workers, advanced producers, and engineering and technical personnel. The committee established "three-way combination" groups for automation, mechanization, high-speed cutting, and transportation "one-network four-izations" to specifically organize all factory employees to carry out this work in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    In terms of mechanization and automation, based on the principle of easy first, difficult later, the processing and production lines for bearings, gear machines, wood screws, micrometer calipers, and other products that will be produced in large quantities next year will be converted to automation. The factory has already begun designing and reforming six automated production lines. Among them, the automated screw processing production line has recently been successfully tested. Previously, the production of wood screws required fifteen machine tools and thirty-two workers; after automation, the production of the same number of wood screws only requires three workers and five machine tools. The remaining automated production lines are currently accelerating the design drawings and adjusting machine tools, striving to put most of them into production in the first quarter of next year.
    Regarding the adoption of new processes, the factory is vigorously promoting advanced technologies such as precision casting, hollow forging, and electrolytic hydraulic polishing. Recently, the workers have successfully tested the processing method for 800,000 machine parts that will be produced next year. It can be officially put into production at the beginning of next year. At the same time, advanced processing methods for eleven other major machine parts are being stepped up. After machine parts are converted to precision casting, not only will working hours be saved, but also raw materials, manpower, and equipment will be greatly saved. According to preliminary estimates, steel alone can save about 1,000 tons next year; save more than 200 workers and save 100 machine tools.
    In terms of adopting advanced high-speed cutting technology, the factory mobilized the workers to extensively check the performance and potential power of the machines. It has been found that 80.1% of the machine tools in the factory only need to be slightly adjusted or improved to increase work efficiency by one to five times. There are some automated special machine tools with high precision in the factory. For five years, they have only maintained a quota of seventy pieces per day. In the past, no one had thought about moving their brains on the speed issue of these machine tools. This time, after bold experiments by the workers, the original speed of 3,000 revolutions per minute was increased to 4,000 or 5,000 revolutions per minute, and the product quality still met the requirements.
    In terms of transportation, the factory is establishing a transportation network throughout the factory to achieve "one-network four-izations." At present, they are using the terrain of the river bank to build cable car lines to eliminate the phenomenon of shoulder carrying and human lifting. The light railway, which is more than 27,000 meters long, has also begun construction. After these railways are completed, dozens of workshops throughout the factory can be connected in all directions. In this way, the factory can easily transport thousands of tons of raw materials and semi-finished products to various relevant workshops every day next year, and quickly transport the products out. In addition, the factory is using the uneven terrain to start building aerial cableway transportation between production workshops; converting the factory's cargo trucks into dump trucks; and actively carrying out the installation of cranes for loading and unloading goods to ensure that transportation within the factory is more convenient and reasonable.

　　革新无止境　潜力无穷尽
    重庆建设机床厂大闹技术革新保证明年计划积极可靠
    本报重庆28日电　重庆建设机床厂在进行的生产准备工作中，针对代外厂培训的徒工大批返回原岗位，因而人员大大减少的特点，发动职工群众，大搞“三化”（高速化、机械化、自动化）“四改”（改进工艺、改进工具、改进设计、改进设备），以解决劳动力、原料材料、运输能力不足的困难，确保明年开门红，并实现继续全面跃进。
    这个厂明年的生产任务在不增加人员的前提下，比今年增加46.5％。要完成这个任务，就存在着不少的困难。这个厂的党委认真分析了企业里的形势以后，提出了大搞技术革新和技术革命，积极着手进行机械化、自动化、高速化，和大力改进工具、改进设计和设备的口号。12月初厂里专门成立了技术革命委员会，由党委书记挂帅，并吸收了老工人、先进生产者和工程技术人员参加。委员会下设自动化、机械化、高速切削化、运输“一网四化”等“三结合”小组，具体组织全厂职工有计划有步骤地开展这几方面的工作。
    在机械化和自动化方面，根据先易后难的原则，首先将明年要大宗生产的轴承、齿轮机、木螺钉、分厘卡尺等产品的加工生产线改为自动化。全厂已经着手设计和改革六条自动化生产线。其中螺钉加工自动化生产线最近已试验成功。在此以前，生产木螺钉需要十五部机床，三十二个工人；实现自动化以后，生产同样数量的木螺钉，只要三个工人、五部机床。其余的几条自动化生产线，目前正在加速设计图纸和调整机床，争取大部分在明年一季度内投入生产。
    在采用新工艺方面，这个厂正在大抓精密铸造、空心锻造、电解液压抛光等先进技术。最近职工们已经把明年要生产八十万件机器零件的加工方法试验成功。明年一开年，就可以正式投入生产。同时还有十一种主要机器零件的先进加工方法，正在加紧进行。机器零件改为精密铸造以后，不仅节约了工时，而且还可大大节省原料材料，节省人力和设备。据初步估算，明年仅钢材一项，便可节约一千吨左右；节约劳动力二百多人，节省机床一百台。
    在采用高速切削的先进技术方面，这个厂发动了职工群众广泛检查机器的性能和潜在力量。目前已发现全厂有80.1％的机床，只需要稍加调整或改进以后，工效可提高一倍至五倍。厂里有一些精度很高的自动化专用机床，五年来，每天只保持七十件的定额，过去谁也没有想在这些机床的速度问题上动过脑筋。这次工人们经过大胆试验，将原来三千转的速度再提高到开四千转、五千转，产品质量仍然符合要求。
    在运输方面，这个厂正在全厂范围内建立运输网，以实现“一网四化”。目前，他们正在利用江岸地势，修建缆车道，以消灭肩挑人抬现象。长达两万七千多米的轻便铁道，也已开始修建。这些铁路建成后，全厂几十个车间都可四通八达，联成一气。这样一来，这个厂明年每天就可把上千吨的原料材料和半成品很方便地输送到各个有关车间，并迅速把产品运出。此外，这个厂正利用高低不平的地形，着手在生产车间之间建立空中索道运输；将厂里装运货物的卡车改成翻斗式；并积极进行设置起卸货物的吊车等工作，以保证厂内运输更加便利更加合理。
