　　To Prepare Seeds and Store Water for Spring Planting
　　Shandong Strengthens Inspection and Storage of Improved Varieties; Hebei Fully Utilizes Reservoirs and Ponds for Water Storage

Xinhua News Agency report: Shandong is strengthening the inspection and storage of improved varieties to prepare for continued leaps forward in agricultural production next year.

In recent years, Shandong has cultivated and promoted more than 120 improved varieties of crops, including wheat Bimayi No. 1 and No. 4, corn Golden Queen and Andong Mayazi, sweet potatoes Victory No. 100 and Huadong No. 117, and multi-spike sorghum. These improved varieties generally increase production by 10% to 30% compared to local varieties. They have played a significant role in achieving bumper harvests in agricultural production. Since the people's communes were established, the work of breeding improved varieties in various places has undergone new developments, and disease-free and pest-free improved seed bases have been universally established. This autumn, when sowing wheat, the improved seed bases established throughout the province accounted for 12% of the total sown area. Dedicated personnel were assigned to manage and carefully cultivate these bases, striving to fully meet the need for improved wheat varieties next year. The province has also established more than 1,100 improved seed breeding and testing bases for crops such as corn, sorghum, and sweet potatoes.

In order to effectively prepare improved varieties for spring and summer crops next year, in October this year, the provincial grain, agriculture, and commerce departments organized a group of cadres to conduct an in-depth inspection of the selection and storage work. People's communes have adopted methods such as separate harvesting, separate threshing, dedicated warehouse storage, dedicated personnel responsibility, and storage according to varieties to select and store improved seeds.

Xinhua News Agency report: Hebei is making full use of existing water conservancy projects to launch mass water storage activities to prepare water for next year's broadcasting of paddy fields and spring irrigation. Many existing projects such as large reservoirs, depressions, and rivers have stored large amounts of water. According to calculations from three reservoirs, Gangnan, Guanting, and Douhe, and more than ten depressions such as Baiyangdian, approximately 4.85 billion cubic meters of water have been stored. Small and medium-sized reservoirs in mountainous areas have also stored water. The remaining ponds and channels with conditions for water storage are actively strengthening embankments and sub-dams to store water. Many places have filled the ponds by the villages and the channels by the fields with water.

This year's water storage activities are being carried out in conjunction with the construction of projects and winter irrigation. Many counties have adopted the method of building and using water conservancy projects simultaneously, using them as soon as they are built. Many newly built small and medium-sized reservoirs in the Shijiazhuang area have stored 200 million cubic meters of water after more than 20 days of effort by the construction workers, which can provide five or six irrigations for 650,000 mu of wheat. After Xinle County launched mass winter irrigation and water storage activities, by December 5th, the winter-irrigated wheat accounted for 94% of the sown area, and the winter-irrigated fallow land accounted for 70% of the total fallow land. The water stored in the multi-irrigated small reservoirs, in addition to ensuring water for winter irrigation, can also provide four to six irrigations for 290,000 mu of farmland next spring.

Many regions are comprehensively arranging existing water sources, according to the spirit of "first canals, second wells, and third reservoirs," and are first using river water and groundwater for winter irrigation to save reservoir water for irrigation next year.

　　为春播备种蓄水
    山东加强良种检查保管工作  河北充分利用水库坑塘蓄水
    据新华社讯　山东各地加强良种检查保管工作，为明年农业生产继续跃进作准备。
    几年来，山东各地培育和推广的良种有小麦碧蚂一、四号，玉米金皇后、安东马牙，地瓜胜利百号、华东一百一十七号和多穗高粱等共一百二十多种，这些农作物优良品种一般比当地品种能增产10％至30％以上。对实现农业生产丰收起了很大作用。人民公社化以后，各地良种繁育工作有了新的发展，普遍建立了无病虫害良种基地。今秋播种小麦时，全省建立的良种基地占播种总面积的12％，并固定专人管理，精心培植，争取充分满足明年小麦良种的需要。全省还建立了一千一百多处玉米、高粱、地瓜等作物的良种培育试验基地。
    为了切实作好明年春夏作物的良种准备工作，今年10月，省粮食、农业、商业部门就曾经组织一批干部深入检查了选贮工作。各人民公社都采取单收、单打、专仓保管、专人负责、按品种分别存放的方法选留和保管良种。
    据新华社讯　河北各地充分利用现有水利工程，展开群众性的蓄水活动，为明年广播稻田和春播灌溉准备用水。许多大型水库、洼淀、河道等现有工程已大量地蓄水，据岗南、官厅、陡河等三个水库和白洋淀等十多个洼淀计算，约已蓄水四十八亿五千万立方米。山区中小型水库有的也已经蓄水。其余有条件蓄水的坑塘、渠道等正积极加固围堤、子埝，进行蓄水。很多地方把村边坑塘、地边渠道都蓄满了水。
    今年的蓄水活动是结合兴建工程和冬灌进行的。许多县采取了水利工程边建边用，建一处用一处的方法。石家庄专区许多新修的中小型水库，经过工地民工二十多天的努力，已蓄水二亿立方米，可供六十五万亩小麦普浇五、六遍。新乐县开展群众性冬灌、蓄水活动后，到12月5日，冬灌的小麦已占播种面积94％，冬灌的空茬地已占空茬地总数70％。多灌小型水库所蓄的水，除了保证冬灌用水以外，还可供明春二十九万亩耕地普浇四至六次水。
    许多地区全面安排现有水源，根据“一渠、二井三水库”的精神，首先用河水和地下水进行冬灌，节约库水，以备明年灌溉。
