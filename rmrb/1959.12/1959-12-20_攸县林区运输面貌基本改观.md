The eastern part of You County, Hunan Province, is a region of towering mountains and lush forests. Originally, timber transportation in this forest area was extremely difficult. During the Great Leap Forward last year, under the leadership of the county party committee, forestry workers carried out massive tool reforms and transportation infrastructure construction, fundamentally changing the backward state of transportation.

Now, this forest area has erected 146 skidding chutes, totaling 133 li in length; built 12 earth railway lines (a type of wooden track) and one double track, totaling 94.5 li in length; and also built a high-altitude bamboo rail flatcar line, dredged four river channels, blasted more than 4,000 cubic meters of reefs, and built five large dams and more than 30 small dams. This has fundamentally changed the transportation situation in the forest area. In the Caobo and Baishi forest areas, where forest resources are concentrated, dragging paths and earth railway lines crisscross from the mountains to the small streams. Various skidding chutes, dragging paths, and earth railway lines are connected like a spider web, forming a complete timber transportation network. People proudly call Muze, the transportation center of the Caobo forest area, "Little Zhuzhou." Dangerous areas where timber could not be transported in the past, and large trees that could not be transported down in several years, are now being transported out smoothly. Streams that have never been used for timber floating can now be used for "herding sheep" floating. By the end of August this year, 99% of the annual transportation task had been completed.

Due to the large-scale tool reforms and basic construction of transportation, more than 98% of manual carrying on the mountains has been eliminated for land transportation, which improved work efficiency, and costs have also been reduced. Taking the Caobo logging site as an example, the average land transportation distance from the mountains to the streams is 38 li. Manual carrying of each cubic meter of timber required 14.5 workdays and cost more than 20 yuan. After the earth railway line was built, the timber could be transported directly from the mountains to the streams, requiring only seven workdays per cubic meter of timber, with a transportation cost of more than nine yuan, reducing the cost by 40%. Due to opening roads through mountains and building bridges over water, and the construction of earth railway lines and skidding chutes, the timber transportation distance has been greatly shortened compared to manual carrying. The Baishi logging site built seven earth railway lines; the shoulder-carrying distance was 325 li, while the cart-transport distance was only 25 li. With these transportation tools, the labor intensity has been greatly reduced, and safe production has been ensured. The workers composed a song: "For thousands of years, timber transportation relied on carrying on the back, today timber transportation relies on pushing carts; it saves effort and is safe, and work efficiency is increased several times." Xiang, a 53-year-old veteran worker, sang while pushing the cart: "I push the cart with joy in my heart, the cart transports timber with unmatched power; in the past, I could only carry one log, now the cart pushes one meter."

    攸县林区运输面貌基本改观
    湖南省攸县东部是一个崇山峻岭，林木葱郁的地区。原来这个林区的木材运输十分困难，去年的大跃进，林业职工在县委的领导下，进行了巨大的工具改革和运输基建工作，基本上改变了落后的运输面貌。
    现在，这个林区架设了一百四十六条滑道，总长一百三十三华里；修建十二条土火车道（一种木轨道）和一条复线，共长九十四华里半；还修了一条高空竹轨平车道，疏浚了四条河道，炸掉礁石四千多立方米，修大坝五座和小坝三十多座。这样就根本改变了林区的运输面貌。在森林资源集中的漕泊、柏市两个林区，从山上到小溪边，拖道和土火车道纵横交错，各种滑道、拖道和土火车道如同蛛网相连，形成了完整的木材运输网，人们自豪地把漕泊林区运输中心木泽称之为“小株洲”。过去无法运材的险要地带和几年运不下来的大树，现在都顺利地运了出来。从来没有流送过木材的溪流，也可以进行赶羊流送了。今年到8月底，就完成了全年运输任务的99％。
    由于大搞工具改革和运输的基本建设工作，在山上的陆运98％以上消灭了肩运，提高了工作效率，成本也有所降低。以漕泊采伐场为例，从山场到溪边的陆运里程，平均是三十八华里，人工肩运，每立方米木材需要十四个半工，运费是二十多元，修了土火车道，从山上一直运到溪边，运每立方米木材只需要七个工，运费九元多，成本降低40％。由于逢山开路、遇水架桥，修了土火车道、滑道，运材里程比人工肩运里程大大缩短。柏市采伐场，修了七条土火车道，肩运里程是三百二十五里，而车运里程只有二十五里。有了这些运输工具以后，劳动强度大大减轻，安全生产有了保证。职工们编了一首歌：“千年运材靠肩背，今日运材车子推；既省力来又安全，工效提高好几倍”。五十三岁的祥工老工人边推车边唱歌：“我推车子心中喜，车子运材力无比；过去只能背一根，现在车子推一米”。
