　　Harbin, December 26th (report from this newspaper) Under the leadership of the Party, the workers of the Fifth Construction Engineering Company of Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, adhering to the spirit of building the basic construction industry in a faster, better, and more economical way, have successfully experimented with using furnace ash to build large buildings and hot air for heating. In collaboration with the Harbin City Design Institute, they have recently completed a three-story civilian building with an area of 896 square meters – the New Technology Experimental Building.

　　This New Technology Experimental Building is a new development based on the "Four No's" building built in Harbin last year. All of its building materials do not use bricks, tiles, sand, stone, wood, steel, or cement, but instead uses precast silicate blocks made from raw materials such as furnace ash, ore residue, and pumice as the main body of the building, and artificial fiberboard made from straw as door and window frames. 70% of the building materials for the entire building are furnace ash. At the same time, instead of using boilers, cast iron pipes, and radiators to deliver heat for heating, a hot air furnace made of red bricks is used to heat the air, which is then sent through underground earthenware pipes into the wall ducts, and heat is radiated through heat sinks for heating. This breaks away from the constraints of commonly used materials in the history of construction and opens up a wide range of material sources for the construction industry.

　　The New Technology Experimental Building built in Harbin City has five advantages: (1) In terms of the use of building materials, it saves a large amount of building materials by utilizing industrial and agricultural production waste such as furnace ash, ore residue, and straw. Compared with the same mixed-structure building, this building can save 7.4 tons of steel, 40 tons of cement, 12.85 tons of cast iron pipes, boilers, and radiators, 26 cubic meters of wood, 310 cubic meters of rubble and river stone, 210 cubic meters of sand, 200,000 red bricks, and 5,600 tiles. (2) Using furnace ash and other raw materials to prefabricate silicate blocks as the main body of the building achieves lightweight and high strength. Since this building uses porous lightweight materials such as furnace ash, ore residue, and pumice to replace heavy aggregates such as river stone, and adopts hollow components in the structure, the weight of the entire building is reduced by one-third compared with ordinary mixed-structure buildings. The compressive strength of the building has been repeatedly tested and proven to exceed design requirements. Its thermal insulation performance is also strong; when the outdoor temperature is minus 15 degrees Celsius, the indoor temperature is often maintained at around 15 degrees Celsius above zero by releasing hot air every other day. (3) The use of silicate blocks prefabricated from furnace ash and other raw materials as building materials creates good conditions for mechanized hoisting and assembly-style rapid construction, saving a lot of labor. Therefore, this building was built in only ten days, and the maximum number of construction workers used was only 28. (4) Using industrial and agricultural production waste as building materials greatly reduces construction costs compared with ordinary brick-wood mixed structures. The cost per cubic meter of silicate blocks is 14% lower than that of red brick masonry, and 11% lower than that of concrete masonry, while the cost of using straw artificial fiberboard is 50% lower than that of wood. (5) Using hot air radiation for heating not only saves 24% of fuel, but also balances the indoor temperature. The coal smoke burned in its air heating furnace is recovered by a filter bag to collect carbon black, and then the remaining waste gas is sent into the exhaust pipes of the residential bathroom to be discharged outside the house. This eliminates the need for large chimneys and is of great benefit to improving urban sanitation. The indoor heating of the building uses clean air heated by an air heating furnace.

　　This New Technology Experimental Building is the product of implementing the General Line and achieving the Great Leap Forward under the leadership of the Party. The Harbin Municipal Party Committee attaches great importance to the growth of this new thing. From the groundbreaking of this building, some people doubted whether furnace ash could be used to build a building. During the trial production of silicate blocks, more than a dozen attempts failed. At this time, some people advocated "don't build a three-story building," "build a small bungalow for testing." In response to this situation, the Party committee of the company put forward the slogan to the workers that "we will not give up until the experiment is successful." After sixty experiments, they finally successfully trial-produced silicate blocks. After the building was built, according to the original design, during on-site research and experiments, the hot air could not reach the room, so the design department and the construction department had little confidence in the experiment. In response to this situation, the Harbin Municipal Party Committee decided that the leading comrades of the Ministry of Basic Construction, the Construction Engineering Bureau, and other departments should form a leading group to strengthen the leadership of the experiment. According to Comrade Ren Zhongyi's instructions, the company, combined with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, boosted greater enthusiasm and started the experiment again, and finally delivered the hot air to the room.

　　In the process of construction, the New Technology Experimental Building fully utilized the experience of carrying out mass movements and "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." The company's leaders participated in labor and went deep into the specific key points to solve specific problems. A three-combination group with the participation of veteran technical workers was organized on the construction site, and more than 100 three-combination meetings were held, solving countless technical problems.

### 不用砖、瓦、砂、石、木材、钢材、水泥、暖气片、铸铁管  哈尔滨建成新技术试验楼  用炉灰渣、矿石渣、稻草等作材料，成本低、建设快、经济适用

　　不用砖、瓦、砂、石、木材、钢材、水泥、暖气片、铸铁管
    哈尔滨建成新技术试验楼
    用炉灰渣、矿石渣、稻草等作材料，成本低、建设快、经济适用
    本报哈尔滨26日电　黑龙江省哈尔滨市第五建筑工程公司职工在党的领导下，本着多快好省地进行基本建设事业的精神，用炉灰渣子盖大楼，用热风取暖试验成功。他们和哈尔滨市设计院协作，新近建成一座面积八百九十六平方米三层民用楼房——新技术试验楼。
    这座新技术试验楼是去年哈尔滨市建成的“四不用”大楼的新发展，它的全部建筑材料不用砖、瓦、砂、石、木材、钢材和水泥，而用炉灰渣、矿石渣、浮石等原料制成的预制矽酸盐砌块作建筑物主体，用稻草制成人造纤维板作门窗框，整个大楼70％的建筑材料用的是炉灰渣子。同时不用锅炉、铸铁管和暖气片来送热取暖，而是用红砖砌成空气加热炉，把空气加热后通过地下缸瓦管道送入屋墙孔道里，通过散热板辐射热风取暖。这就摆脱了建筑史上惯用材料的束缚。为建筑事业开辟了广泛的材料来源。
    哈尔滨市建成的这座新技术试验楼有五个优点：（1）在建筑材料使用上，由于利用了炉灰渣、矿石渣和稻草等工农业生产废料，节约了大量的建筑材料。这座楼房和同样的混合结构建筑物比较，可以节约钢筋七点四吨，水泥四十吨，铸铁管、锅炉、暖气片等十二点八五吨，木材二十六立方米，毛石、河流石等三百一十立方米，砂子二百一十立方米，红砖二十万块，瓦五千六百块。（2）用炉灰渣等原料预制矽酸盐砌块作建筑物主体，作到了轻质、高强度。由于这座楼房用炉灰渣、矿石渣和浮石等多孔轻质材料代替了河流石等重骨料，并在结构上采用了空心构件，就使整个建筑物的重量比一般混合结构建筑物减轻三分之一。而建筑物的抗压强度，经反复试验证明超过设计要求。它的保温性能也强，室外气温在摄氏零下十五度时，隔日放一次热空气，室内温度经常保持在摄氏零上十五度左右。（3）由于采用炉灰渣等为原料预制的矽酸盐砌块为建筑材料，为机械化吊装的装配式快速施工创造了良好条件，节省了大量的劳动力。因此，这座楼房只用十多天的时间，施工人数最多时才用二十八名工人就建成了。（4）利用工农业生产废料作建筑材料，比一般砖木混合结构大大降低了建筑成本。每立方米矽酸盐砌块比红砖砌体降低成本14％，比混凝土砌体降低成本11％，而用稻草人造纤维板更比用木材降低成本50％。（5）用热风辐射取暖，不仅节约24％的燃料，而且室内温度均衡。它所用的空气加热炉，燃烧过的煤烟经过过滤袋收回炭黑，然后将剩下的废气送入住宅卫生间的排气管道排出屋外，这样就不用大烟囱，对改善城市卫生有很大好处，而大楼室内取暖，是用空气加热炉加热净洁的空气。
    这座新技术试验楼，是在党的领导下，贯彻执行总路线实现大跃进的产物。中共哈尔滨市委非常重视这一新鲜事物的成长。这座楼房从破土动工，就曾有人怀疑用炉灰渣子能盖起楼房。在试制矽酸盐砌块时，一连十几次都失败了，这时，就有人主张“不要盖三层楼了”，“盖个小平房试验试验吧”。这个公司党委针对这种情况，向职工提出“不试验成功不罢休”的口号。经过六十次的试验，终于试制成功了矽酸盐大块。当楼房盖起来后，按照原设计方案，在现场研究试验中，热风总通不到室内，因而设计部门和建筑部门对试验信心不大。哈尔滨市委针对这种情况，决定由基本建设部、建工局等部门的领导同志组成领导小组，加强试验领导。这个公司根据任仲夷同志的指示，结合八届八中全会的精神，鼓起更大干劲，又开始试验，终于把热空气通到室内。
    新技术试验楼在建设过程中，充分运用大搞群众运动和“两参一改三结合”的经验。这个公司领导干部都参加劳动，深入到具体关键中去解决具体问题。在工地组织了有老技术工人参加的三结合小组，共开了一百多次三结合会议，解决了无数的技术问题。（附图片）
