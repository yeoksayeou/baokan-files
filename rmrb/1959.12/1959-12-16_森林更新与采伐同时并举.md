	Forest Regeneration and Logging Proceed Simultaneously
	Zhang Guangyou
	Since the Great Leap Forward last year, especially this year, China's forest regeneration area has reached and exceeded the logging area amidst the rapid growth of timber production. This is a major event in China's forestry production and a great victory for the Party's forestry production policy of "logging and regeneration proceeding simultaneously."
	Logging and regeneration are the two major tasks of timber production. Logging timber to support socialist construction is in the country's current interests; regeneration and afforestation to develop forest reserve resources are in the country's long-term interests. If we only log without regenerating or regenerate very little, we cannot guarantee the continued production of forests and the timber needed for long-term national construction. Therefore, logging and regeneration is a matter of combining long-term interests with current interests, and both must be taken into account. China's forest area accounts for a small proportion of the total land area. From the perspective of the long-term interests of the people across the country, our regeneration work should not only keep up with logging, but should also exceed logging. Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the rapid development of China's socialist construction, the demand for timber has increased sharply, and the logging area has increased rapidly. Therefore, it is necessary to further and conscientiously implement the policy of "logging and regeneration proceeding simultaneously" to ensure the country's future need for timber in its construction.
	Under the leadership of the Party, China's forest regeneration work has achieved great results in recent years. Especially since 1958, due to the close integration of forest cultivation and utilization, the forest industrial enterprises engaged in timber logging and transportation and the forestry institutions engaged in forest management have been merged into a comprehensive enterprise combining logging and cultivation. Due to the close integration of logging and cultivation, the forest regeneration area achieved greater results this year. Heilongjiang Province, which is responsible for one-third of China's timber production, has overfulfilled its plans for both timber production and forest regeneration area by adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, launching a large-scale mass movement, and conscientiously implementing the policy of logging and regeneration proceeding simultaneously. The forestry bureaus in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have all taken forest regeneration work as an important production task, reversing the long-standing situation in which regeneration lagged behind logging, and proposed that forest regeneration should always keep up with logging in the future.
	In order to ensure that logging areas can be regenerated in a timely manner, in addition to continuing to implement the policy of "logging and regeneration proceeding simultaneously," we must also implement the policy of "artificial regeneration as the main method and natural regeneration as the auxiliary method" in forest regeneration work. Artificial regeneration has the advantages of uniform distribution, fast growth, good material quality, high yield per unit area, and ensuring the rapid restoration of logged areas into forests. Therefore, the proportion of artificial regeneration should be appropriately increased in forest regeneration work; natural regeneration should only be used when various conditions are suitable. Even in areas with natural regeneration, artificial management should be strengthened and measures should be taken to promote natural regeneration with artificial means, so as to ensure the continuous improvement of the quality of forest regeneration work and the faster development of forestry production.

    森林更新与采伐同时并举
    张广友
    去年大跃进以来，特别是今年，我国的森林更新面积在木材生产迅速增长的情况下，达到和超过了采伐面积。这是我国林业生产上的一件大事，是党的“采伐与更新同时并举”的林业生产方针的伟大胜利。
    采伐和更新是木材生产的两大任务。采伐木材支援社会主义建设，是国家当前的利益；更新、造林，发展森林后备资源是国家长远利益。如果只采伐不更新或少更新，就不能保证森林的继续生产和国家长远建设所需木材。因此，采伐和更新是长远利益和目前利益相结合的问题，两者必须兼顾。我国的森林面积在国土总面积中所占比重较少，从全国人民长远利益来看，我们的更新工作不仅要跟上采伐，还应该超过采伐。大跃进以来，由于我国社会主义建设事业迅速发展，木材的需要量急剧增长了，采伐面积迅速增加，因此也就需要更进一步认真贯彻“采伐与更新同时并举”的方针，以保证今后国家建设对木材的需要。
    我国的森林更新工作，几年来在党的领导下，取得了很大的成绩。特别是1958年以来，由于把培育森林和利用森林的工作密切结合了起来，将从事木材采伐运输的森林工业企业与从事森林经营的林业机构合并成了一个采育相结合的综合性的企业。由于采育工作密切结合，今年森林更新面积取得更大成绩。担负我国木材生产任务三分之一的黑龙江省，由于坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，认真贯彻执行采伐与更新同时并举的方针，木材生产和森林更新面积都超额完成了计划。内蒙古自治区各林业局都把森林更新工作作为一项重要生产任务，扭转了长期以来更新落后于采伐的局面，并提出今后让森林更新永远跟上采伐。
    为了保证伐区能够及时更新，除了继续贯彻“采伐与更新同时并举”的方针外，在进行森林更新工作中还必须贯彻“人工更新为主，天然更新为辅”的方针。人工更新具有分布均匀、生长快、材质好、单位面积产量高、确保采伐迹地迅速恢复成林的种种优点，因此，在森林更新工作中应适当增加人工更新的比重；只有在各种条件适宜的情况下，才采用天然更新。就是在天然更新的地区，也要加强人工管理，实行以人工促进天然更新的措施，这样才能保证森林更新工作质量不断提高，林业生产更快发展。
