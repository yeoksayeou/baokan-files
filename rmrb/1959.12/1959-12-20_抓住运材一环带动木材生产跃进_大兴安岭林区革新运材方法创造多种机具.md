    Grasp the Log Hauling Link to Drive the Leap Forward in Timber Production
    Da Hinggan Ling Forest Area Innovates Log Hauling Methods and Creates Various Machines
    (Our dispatch) The Da Hinggan Ling Forest Area in Inner Mongolia, focusing on log hauling, utilizing both indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously engaging in mass-based technical innovation and technical revolution movements, has greatly improved the efficiency of existing machinery. Workers who originally used manual tools are now using indigenous machines or new methods to replace them, promoting a great leap forward in timber production and entering 1960 forty-two days ahead of schedule. As of December 10th, the annual plan was completed by 107.8%, an increase of 28.9% over the same period last year.
    The Da Hinggan Ling Forest Area Party Committee has always attached great importance to technological innovation. Last summer, when the "automobile train" log hauling method appeared in the forest area, the Forest Area Party Committee immediately grasped and promoted it. Soon, log hauling trucks throughout the area became "long dragons" with two to three or four trailers. Most forestry bureaus saw a doubling of truck log hauling volume without increasing truck equipment. A few truck drivers even created records exceeding their original quotas by five to ten times.
    After the great innovation in the log hauling process, the volume of timber handled increased significantly, which in turn drove innovation and leaps forward in the felling and skidding processes. In skidding, new tools and methods emerged, including wooden rail flatcars, wooden rail skids, wooden monorail handcarts, and the use of mountain slopes and ice and snow conditions to create aircraft-style sledges, ice chutes, and snow gully skidding methods. For example, the aircraft-style sledge created by workers at the Ke Yihe Forestry Bureau increased efficiency by about 100%. Felling workers promoted the advanced experience of brother forestry areas—the "May 1st" type curved saw, which is about 30% more efficient than ordinary curved saws. In the loading process, workers Wang Shoutong and Zhang Xiushan created a rolling loading tool, which is one-third to one times more efficient than manual lifting for loading trucks.
    The Party Committee and the Administration Bureau have successively held on-the-spot meetings in the Kudu'er, Genhe, and Tulihe Forestry Bureaus to promote these new tools and new methods.

    抓住运材一环带动木材生产跃进
    大兴安岭林区革新运材方法创造多种机具
    本报讯　内蒙古大兴安岭林区以运材为中心，土洋并举，大搞群众性技术革新和技术革命运动，原来的机械大大提高了效率。原来用手工工具生产的工人纷纷用土机具或新方法来代替，推动了木材生产大跃进，提前四十二天跨进了1960年。到12月10日止，完成全年计划107.8％，比去年同期增长28.9％。
    大兴安岭林区党委对于革新技术一向就很重视。去年夏天，林区出现汽车列车式运材法的时候，林区党委立即抓紧推广，全区运材汽车很快成为带有二节到三、四节拖车的“长龙”。多数林业局在不增加汽车设备情况下，汽车运材量猛增一倍左右。少数汽车司机还创造了超过原定额五倍到十倍的纪录。
    运材工序大革新以后，吞吐的木材大量增加，这就带动了采伐和集材工序也纷纷革新技术，跃进上来。集材中出现了木轨平车、木轨滑扛、木单轨手扶车，和利用山坡、冰雪条件创造飞机式爬犁，和冰槽、雪沟集材法等十多种新工具和新方法。如克一河林业局工人创造的飞机式爬犁，工效提高一倍左右。采伐工人们推广兄弟林区的先进经验——“五一”型弯把锯，比普通弯把锯提高效率30％左右。在装车工序中，工人王守通和张秀山创造的滚动式装车工具，比人抬装汽车提高效率三分之一到一倍。
    党委和管理局曾先后分别在库都尔、根河和图里河林业局召开现场会议，推广这些新工具和新方法。
