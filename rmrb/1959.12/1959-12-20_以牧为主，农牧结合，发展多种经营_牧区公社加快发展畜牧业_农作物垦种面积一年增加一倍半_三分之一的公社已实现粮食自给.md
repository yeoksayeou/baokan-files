    With Animal Husbandry as the Main Focus, Combining Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Developing Diversified Operations
    Pastoral Communes Accelerate the Development of Animal Husbandry
    Arable Acreage for Crops Increases One and a Half Times in a Year; One-Third of Communes Have Achieved Grain Self-Sufficiency
    (Our Newspaper News) Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the broad masses of laboring herdsmen in Qinghai Province, after realizing people's communization in 1958, continue to advance bravely with leaping steps, thereby causing tremendous changes in the appearance of the grasslands.
    Over the past year, thanks to giving play to the superiority of the people's communes, the productive forces in the pastoral areas have been further liberated, opening up a broad road for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. Qinghai's pastoral areas have sufficient grasslands, but in the past, they were mostly divided and occupied by herd owners and headmen, and could not be fully utilized. Now, due to the change in the ownership of the means of production, the grasslands have been more rationally planned and used. After people's communization, herdsmen of all ethnic groups, according to the type, size, male and female of livestock, generally reduced the size of herds and, on the basis of assigning fixed personnel to graze, carried out contracting for work and output and a competition movement for over-production rewards, making this year's livestock fatter than in any previous year, and the survival rate of breeding higher than in any previous year, resulting in a large number of high-yield, bumper-harvest herds. In Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the breeding survival rate of 11,017 ewes in thirty-six bumper harvest herds reached 100% to 130%. Since August, encouraged by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, herdsmen of all ethnic groups, based on the grazing experience of "summer fattening grows meat, autumn fattening grows oil, with fat and oil, there is no worry in winter and spring," further launched a vigorous mass movement, vigorously grasping fattening and protecting fat and breeding work. At the same time, they also started to do winter protection work such as haymaking and storage, repairing sheds and building fences. Up to now, all kinds of livestock are generally fat and strong, most of the breeding-age female animals have basically achieved full mating and pregnancy, most of the livestock have pens, young livestock have sheds, and more than 1.2 billion catties of green grass have been harvested and stored. The work of protecting livestock safely through the winter has been done earlier and better than in previous years.
    While ensuring the high-speed development of animal husbandry production, the people's communes in various places have also implemented the policy of "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations," rationally arranging labor, establishing specialized teams for agricultural production and other sideline production, and actively developing diversified production activities. This year, the various crops cultivated by the communes on the grasslands reached more than 330,000 mu, an increase of one and a half times compared with last year. Of the thirty-five counties (cities) and one hundred and twenty-two communes in the pastoral area, ten counties and forty-one communes have achieved grain self-sufficiency. In Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, more than half of the seven pastoral communes and thirty-four pastoral brigades have achieved grain self-sufficiency or more than self-sufficiency. The crops such as highland barley, wheat, and potatoes planted by herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the prefecture this year can feed more than 8,900 herdsmen households for more than a year. The harvested straw can solve the winter and spring supplementary feeding needs of 200,000 livestock. The more than 33,000 mu of grain and oil crops harvested this year by the three communes of Qieji, Guomaying, and Heka, in addition to retaining enough seeds, rations for commune members, and livestock feed needed for expanding production next year, can also sell 1.05 million catties of surplus grain to the state. Sideline production in pastoral areas has also developed greatly. Since this winter, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has dug up more than 7.1 million catties of rhubarb and other medicinal materials, greatly increasing the income of communes and commune members. In addition, each commune has also established a number of small factories for livestock product processing, agricultural and pastoral machinery repair, biological drugs, sewing and boot making, etc., according to needs and possibilities, further promoting the development of animal husbandry, agriculture, and various sideline productions.
    The communization of the grasslands has also provided a strong guarantee for the long-cherished dream of settled grazing for the broad masses of herdsmen for thousands of years. While realizing communization, herdsmen of all ethnic groups generally implemented settled living in tents and earthen houses. Now, the broad masses of herdsmen have said goodbye to the nomadic life of living by water and grass. Most of the commune members of the Chaka Commune in Ulan County, Qaidam Basin, have moved out of the tents and yurts that have been their homes for generations, which do not block the wind in winter or the rain in summer, and moved into bright and warm houses with glass windows; many elderly people, children, pregnant women, and patients no longer have to move frequently with livestock, ensuring the health and prosperity of the herdsmen. After settling down, the living habits of the herdsmen have also undergone great changes. There are more varieties of food, they generally eat vegetables, and they have developed the habit of paying attention to hygiene. After settling down for grazing, the collective welfare undertakings of the commune have also begun to be established. Now, public canteens have been generally established in the settlements, and nurseries have been established; there are also medical clinics and shops, and the herdsmen do not have to travel dozens or hundreds of miles to buy things. Medical personnel also go to the homes of herdsmen to see doctors.
    With the improvement and increase of the material life of the herdsmen, cultural and educational undertakings have also greatly developed. Now, not only are there fixed schools in the settlements, but also mobile tent schools that move with the livestock have been established in the pastoral production teams. The spare-time cultural activities of the broad masses of commune members are also unusually active. More than 80% of the young and middle-aged commune members of the Chaka Commune in Ulan County have gotten rid of illiteracy. Now, every team has an amateur cultural night school and subscribes to newspapers in its own language; at the same time, a youth amateur dance team has also been organized. Whenever they are free from labor, everyone gathers together to sing and dance happily, or gathers around the loudspeakers to listen to current affairs news and various songs and dramas.
    Now, encouraged by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of herdsmen in the pastoral areas, on the basis of the great victories already achieved, take livestock raising as the key link, tightly grasp the three central links of fattening and protecting fat, lambing and raising young, and preventing freezing and protecting livestock, vigorously carry out mass movements, actively carry out mating and protecting fetuses, preventing and controlling livestock diseases, building water conservancy, and reclaiming wasteland and farming, to ensure that livestock can safely spend the winter, and prepare for the continued leap forward in animal husbandry and agricultural production next year.

    以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营
    牧区公社加快发展畜牧业
    农作物垦种面积一年增加一倍半　三分之一的公社已实现粮食自给
    本报讯　青海省广大劳动牧民，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在1958年实现人民公社化以后，继续迈着跃进的步伐，奋勇前进，从而使草原面貌发生了巨大变化。
    一年来，由于发挥了人民公社的优越性，进一步解放了牧区生产力，为畜牧业生产的高速度发展开辟了广阔的道路。青海牧区有着足够的草原，但过去多为牧主、头人割据和霸占，不能充分利用。现在，由于生产资料所有制的改变，草原得到了更加合理的规划和使用。人民公社化以后，各族牧民按照牲畜的类别、大小、公母普遍地划小了畜群，并在固定专人放牧的基础上，开展了包工包产和超产奖励的评比竞赛运动，使今年的畜膘比以往任何一年都好，繁殖成活率比以往任何一年都高，出现了大量高额丰产畜群。海北藏族自治州三十六个丰产群的一万一千零一十七只母绵羊，繁殖成活率达到100％到130％。从8月份以后，各族牧民在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，根据“夏膘长肉秋长油，有膘有油，冬春不愁”的放牧经验，进一步掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，大抓抓膘保膘和配种工作。同时，并动手做打草储草、修棚打圈等冬季防冻保畜工作。到目前为止，各类牲畜普遍膘肥体壮，适龄母畜基本上达到全配满怀，大部分牲畜有了圈，幼畜有了棚，打储青草十二亿多斤，保护牲畜安全过冬的工作比往年做得既早又好。
    在保证畜牧业生产高速度发展的同时，各地人民公社还执行了“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针，合理安排劳力，建立了农业生产和其他副业生产的专业队，积极发展多种生产活动。今年，草原各公社垦种的各种农作物达到三十三万多亩，比去年增加了一倍半，牧业区的三十五个县（市）、一百二十二个公社，已经有十个县、四十一个公社实现了粮食自给。海南藏族自治州七个牧业公社和三十四个牧业大队，有半数以上实现了粮食自给或自给有余。全州各族牧民今年播种的青稞、小麦和马铃薯等农作物，可供八千九百多户牧民吃一年有余。所收秸草可以解决二十万头牲畜的冬春补饲需要。切吉、过马营、河卡等三个公社今年所收的三万三千多亩粮食、油料作物，除留足明年扩大生产所需的籽种、社员口粮和牲畜饲料以外，还可以向国家交售一百零五万斤余粮。牧业区的副业生产也有很大的发展。果洛藏族自治州今冬以来已经挖到大黄等药材七百一十多万斤，大大增加了公社和社员的收入。此外，各公社根据需要和可能，还建立了一批畜产品加工、农牧机具修配、生物药品、缝纫制靴等小型工厂，进一步促进了畜牧业、农业和各项副业生产的发展。
    草原公社化还给广大牧民千百年来梦寐以求的定居放牧，提供了有力保证。各族牧民在实现公社化的同时，普遍实行了帐房和土房定居。现在，广大牧民已经永远和逐水草而居的游牧生活告别。柴达木地区乌兰县茶卡公社的大部分社员，已经从祖祖辈辈住着冬不挡风、夏不遮雨的帐房和蒙古包里搬出，住进了装有玻璃窗户、明亮暖和的房子；许多老人、小孩、孕妇、病人，再不用随牲畜经常流动，保证了牧民的身体健康和人丁兴旺。定居以后，牧民的生活习惯也起了很大变化，饮食花样多了，普遍吃上了蔬菜，并养成了讲卫生的习惯。定居放牧以后，公社的集体福利事业也开始兴办起来。现在，各地的定居点上普遍建立了公共食堂和成立了托儿所；还有医疗所和商店，牧民群众也用不着跑到几十里或几百里路以外去买东西了，医务人员还跑到家里去给牧民看病。
    随着牧民物质生活的改善和提高，文教事业也有了很大发展。现在，不但在定居点上办有固定的学校，还在牧业生产队里成立了随牲畜流动的帐房学校。广大社员的业余文化活动也异常活跃。乌兰县茶卡公社80％以上的青壮年社员摆脱了文盲状态。现在队队设有业余文化夜校，订有本民族文字的报纸；同时还组织了青年业余舞蹈队，每当劳动之余，大家就聚在一起欢乐歌舞，或者围在扩音器前收听时事消息和各种歌曲戏剧。
    现在牧业区广大牧民，在党的八届八中全会的精神鼓舞下，在已经取得的伟大胜利基础上，以壮为纲，紧紧抓住抓膘保膘、接羔育幼、防冻保畜三个中心环节，大搞群众运动，积极进行配种保胎、防治畜病、兴修水利和垦荒造田等工作，保证牲畜安全过冬，为明年的牧业、农业生产继续跃进作好准备。
