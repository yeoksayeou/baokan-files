　　Reactionary Illusions
    Soviet Union　Ji Mofeiye夫
    The well-known relaxation of international tensions in recent times is being used by bourgeois ideologists and politicians, as well as representatives of opportunism and modern revisionism from the right wing of the Socialist Party, as a pretext for new attempts to "overthrow" Marxism-Leninism. They are particularly zealous in distorting the position of the Communists and misinterpreting the position of the socialist countries on the principle of peaceful coexistence between the two systems.
    The nonsensical talk about the "organic convergence" and "increasing common ground" between socialist and capitalist countries is a favorite argument of the ideological enemies of communism today.
    Aron, one of the most famous bourgeois sociologists in the West, describes the period of peaceful competition between the two major world systems of capitalism and socialism as a period in which the differences between the two systems in terms of socio-economic systems and class nature are somewhat eased and diminished.
    In his article "Marxism and Anti-Marxism" published in "Le Figaro," he states that industrial growth and technological achievements both lead to similar socio-economic results. Aron wants people to believe that all countries, regardless of their current social system, are essentially developing along the same path, which he says is evolving towards "the same type of industrialized society." Similar to the theory of American economics professor Rostow (whose theory of social development and stages of development is now popular in the capitalist world), he attempts to invent substitutes for Marxist concepts of socio-economic structure, class, and class struggle.
    In Aron's article "Coexistence: The End of Ideology," published in an American magazine, the attempt to obscure and obliterate the class contradictions between the two social systems is even more obvious and blatant. The article states that in the realm of world politics, "the era of ideology may be nearing its end."
    In other words, they want to extend coexistence to the realm of ideology as well.
    The general reasoning process of those who advocate this argument is roughly as follows. First, they virtually acknowledge the rationality, and even the inevitability, of the victory of Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet Union and a series of other countries now belonging to the socialist camp. This confirms the well-known "re-evaluation" prevalent in many Western countries. They further argue that the Western monopoly groups cannot forcibly change the existing system in the socialist camp under modern conditions.
    What should the believers in capitalism do under these conditions? Of course, the wisest approach is not to interfere in the internal affairs of socialist countries, but to retain the hope that certain fundamental "changes" may occur in the socio-economic and political life of these countries. At the same time, some modern bourgeois thinkers and politicians draw completely unrealistic and incorrect conclusions based on correct inferences from realistic and objective facts. Aron says, "What methods can the West use to more effectively evolve the Soviet system (?!)? The question remains open…"
    In other words, the believers in capitalism clearly imply that they hope that the Communists can slowly evolve peacefully in "thought and method."
    No, Mr. Aron, this question is no longer "open," it has long been "settled." What settled this question is the entire course of historical progress. It has been thoroughly and forever settled! Now is the time to believe in the complete victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, and to believe that the socio-economic and political reforms that have taken place in vast areas of the earth in recent decades cannot be reversed. It is time to abandon all illusions and unfounded hopes in this matter.
    Some American revisionists are still propagating such theories. For example, Staro bin recently published an article saying that under the conditions of "competitive coexistence" on the world stage, a so-called "process of mutual infiltration" will occur, that is, elements of one social system will gradually infiltrate and merge into another social system.
    If these unfounded "predictions" did not reflect to some extent the views of more authoritative figures in the capitalist world, they could have been ignored. It is no secret that senior officials in some Western countries who formulate and implement foreign policy guidelines tend to understand coexistence as an opportunity for capitalism to win concessions from socialist countries and the leading forces in these countries—Marxist-Leninist parties—on fundamental ideological issues.
    For example, Mr. Burgess, the U.S. representative to NATO, recently took this view when he spoke at the Detroit Economic Club. He placed great hope on "changes in Russia itself," especially the transformations that were said to be taking place in the Soviet Union due to "frequent contact with the West." This U.S. representative to NATO then elaborated on his so-called "Atlantic" interpretation of the principle of coexistence: "We all hope that, over time, due to these phenomena or those phenomena, coupled with broader education of the Russian people, Russia will gradually become truly able to coexist peacefully."
    Look, this is how NATO leaders understand coexistence! It is astonishing how little realism there is in the arguments of these "Atlantic" strategists who put forward certain "preconditions" for peaceful coexistence.
    In general, some people are trying to confuse the issue of international relations with issues of an ideological nature.
    Peaceful coexistence and competition between the two systems by no means implies a weakening of socialist ideology, but rather a continuation and further development of the struggle between socialist ideas and bourgeois ideas under new conditions and in new forms.
    The Soviet Union's position on this issue has been clearly stated by Khrushchev, the head of the Soviet government, in his report to the recent meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He said: "On ideological issues, we have stood firmly on the basis of Marxism-Leninism in the past, and we will continue to stand on this basis like a rock in the future... We must not confuse mutual concessions that are conducive to peaceful coexistence among countries with concessions in principle, with concessions that involve our socialist system, the essence of our ideology. There is absolutely no question of any concession or compromise here."
    It seems the defenders of capitalism cannot, or are unwilling, to understand such a simple fact: peaceful coexistence and competition between the two systems is not the result of anyone's subjective imagination, but an objective reality. No one is asking Burgess and his colleagues whether they "agree" to peaceful coexistence, and they certainly do not intend to discuss any "preconditions" for this coexistence with them. The coexistence of the two major world systems of socialism and capitalism is a practical fact, a lawful phenomenon reflecting the modern balance of power on the international stage.
    The representatives of the capitalist world fantasize that the position of socialism will weaken, and that the political policies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries will change. But it is not socialism that is becoming weaker, but capitalism; therefore, it is not the socialist countries that are forced to change their government policies, but the capitalist countries. This is an obvious fact.
    Even many bourgeois figures in the West who can still soberly assess the situation now admit that the attitude of the US ruling group towards some extremely important international issues (including the issue of US-Soviet relations) in the past was unrealistic. Therefore, the aggressive and provocative claims of "liberation," "deterrence," and "massive retaliation" have been severely criticized. Everyone knows that groundlessly expecting socialist countries to change their existing system, or at least intimidating socialist countries to make concessions in principle in the scope of policies and ideology, are all based on the above claims.
    Therefore, there is little doubt now that this plan, simultaneously brewed by influential figures in the United States and their partners in NATO, is nothing more than a castle in the air. The dream of weakening the socialist camp has been completely shattered by real life. As a result, some people in Washington now have to make a "painful reassessment," in their terms, of their previous policies to adapt their policies to the major changes taking place on the world stage.
    But, one must ask, since it is recognized that the so-called doctrine of "liberation" which the US policy planners have held for the past few years has gone bankrupt, then on what basis do some stubborn believers of this doctrine expect to succeed now? Now the socialist camp is more powerful and stronger, and the "position of strength" policy has suffered repeated failures.
    It seems that the West is now hoping to gain something from socialist countries under the new conditions that they could not get during the "Cold War" years, such as by actively promoting and intensifying the infiltration of "Western ideas" in socialist countries.
    The bourgeois thinkers start from the point that it seems Communists are afraid of competing with capitalism in terms of thought and that bourgeois ideology has "more" successful "opportunities" in the broad masses of the people than socialist ideology. This is a reactionary and empty fantasy. They want to make mankind go backwards, back to a past era that will never return. Does anyone really expect the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals of socialist countries to agree to such reactionary ideas that praise the "wonders" of capitalist enslavement? Nothing could be more absurd and ridiculous than this plan.
    Communist ideas have achieved great victories, and they are gaining more and more supporters around the world. Communists have always believed, and now more firmly than ever, that communist ideology, which represents the fundamental interests of the most advanced class in modern times—the working class—is superior to the ideology of the bourgeoisie, which is already corrupt and historically destined to perish.
    Even bourgeois thinkers, including Lippmann, Toynbee, as well as political activists like Stevenson or Bowles, have had to admit that capitalism is suffering increasing failures in the "battle for hearts and minds." In capitalist countries, increasingly alarming calls about the "decline of the West" and the lack of prospects for ideological competition with socialism are being issued.
    Communists firmly believe that the historical debate about which system—socialist or capitalist—is better, and whose ideas—the working class's ideas or the bourgeoisie's ideas—are more advanced, and thus will achieve final victory worldwide, cannot and should not be resolved by war, but by peaceful means.
    But, believers in capitalism, do not comfort yourselves with the delusion that the Communists' sincere love of peace indicates that the ideological struggle has at least seen a bit of "moderation," and that the Communist parties and workers' parties have at least somewhat "departed" from the fundamental principles of Marxist-Leninist doctrine.
    Here, let us recall how Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, understood the policy of the Communist Party under the conditions of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between the two systems as appropriate. Lenin pointed out, "Since we are engaged in peaceful construction, we must do everything possible to continue it uninterruptedly." Lenin called on the Communists to be vigilant at all times, and he stressed that "we have no right to tolerate even for a second" the weakening of the achievements of workers and peasants.
    The Communists have always followed these principled instructions of Leninism, and will continue to do so in the future.

　　反动的幻想
    苏联　季莫菲也夫
    最近以来众所周知的国际紧张局势的缓和，被资产阶级思想家和政治家们以及社会党右翼的机会主义和现代修正主义的代表人物当作是“推翻”马克思列宁主义的新企图的借口。他们对歪曲共产党人的立场、曲解社会主义国家在两个制度和平共处原则问题上的立场特别卖力。
    关于社会主义制度国家和资本主义制度国家之间“有机的接近”和“日益扩大的相合之点”的无稽之谈，是现在共产主义的思想敌人最爱用的论点。
    西方最有名的资产阶级社会学家之一阿隆，把资本主义和社会主义两大世界体系之间的和平竞赛时期描写成为两个体系在社会经济制度和阶级本质上的分歧有某些缓和和减弱的时期。
    他在“费加罗报”上发表的题为“马克思主义和反马克思主义”的文章中说，工业增长和技术成就都导致相类似的社会经济结果。阿隆要人相信，所有的国家，不管它们现在的社会制度如何，实质上都是沿着一条道路发展的，据他说，都是向“同一类型的工业化社会”进化。和美国的经济学教授罗斯托（他的社会发达和发展阶段的理论现在风行于资本主义世界）的理论相同，他企图为马克思主义的关于社会经济结构、阶级和阶级斗争的概念发明代用品。
    在阿隆发表在一家美国杂志上的题为“共处：意识形态的结束”一文中，掩盖和抹杀两个社会制度之间的阶级矛盾的企图表现得更明显更露骨。文章中谈道，现时代“在世界政治领域内，意识形态的时代可能已接近末日”。
    换句话说，想使马克思列宁主义者把共处也扩大到意识形态的领域。
    鼓吹这种主张的人的一般推论过程大致是这样。首先，实际上承认马克思列宁主义在苏联和一系列其它现在属于社会主义阵营的国家的条件下胜利的合理性，甚至承认其必然性。这证实了大家都知道的在西方许多国家中流行的“重新估价”。进一步论证西方各国垄断集团在现代条件下不能用强制的办法改变社会主义阵营各国的现行制度。
    资本主义信徒们在这种条件下怎么办？当然，最明智的作法是不要干涉社会主义国家的内政，但保留这样的希望：这些国家社会经济生活、政治生活中可能起某些根本“变化”。同时现代资产阶级的一些思想家和政治家根据对现实的、客观的事实的正确推论却得出了完全不现实、不正确的结论。阿隆说，“西方用什么方法可以更有效地使苏维埃制度进化（？！）？问题仍然是悬案……”。
    换句话说，资本主义的信徒清楚地暗示，他们指望共产党人在“思想和方法”上能够慢慢和平进化。
    不，阿隆先生，这个问题已不是“悬案”，它早已“了结”了。了结这个问题的是整个历史进步的进程。已经彻底而永远地了结了！现在是相信社会主义在苏联彻底胜利、相信近几十年来在地球上广大地区发生的那些社会经济的和政治的改革不能倒退的时候了。在这件事上是放弃一切幻想和无根据的希望的时候了。
    一些美国的修正主义者还在宣传这样的理论。如斯塔罗宾不久前曾发表文章说，在世界舞台上“竞争共处”的条件下，似乎将要发生所谓“双方渗透的过程”，即一种社会制度的因素逐渐渗入和融合到另一种社会制度中去。
    如果这些无根据的“预测”不是多少反映了资本主义世界较有权威人士的观点的话，本来可以不去理睬它。一些西方国家制订和执行对外政策方针的高级官员，容易把共处理解为资本主义争取使社会主义国家和这些国家中的领导力量——马克思列宁主义政党在根本性的思想意识问题上让步的某种机会，这也不是秘密。
    例如，美国驻北大西洋公约组织代表伯吉斯先生不久前在底特律经济俱乐部发表演说时，就是这样来看问题的。他对“俄国本身的变化”寄有很大的希望，特别是希望变革，据说，由于“同西方交往频繁”在苏联就要发生这种变革。这位美国驻北大西洋公约组织代表接着把他自己的所谓“大西洋的”对共处原则的解释阐述如下：“我们大家都希望，天长日久，由于这些现象或那些现象，再加上俄国人民更广泛的教育，能使俄国逐渐变得真正能与之和平共处。”
    瞧，北大西洋公约组织领导人就是这样理解共处的！对和平共处提出某种“先决条件”的这些“大西洋”战略家们的论断中，现实主义精神是如此之少，这只能令人惊讶。
    总的说来，有些人企图把国际关系问题同思想意识性质的问题混淆起来。
    两个制度的和平共处和竞赛决不意味着社会主义意识形态的削弱，而是社会主义思想和资产阶级思想的斗争在新的条件下以新的形式继续和进一步发展。
    苏联在这个问题上的立场，在苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃不久以前举行的会议上所作的报告中已经清楚地表明了。他说：“在意识形态问题上，我们过去坚决站在马克思列宁主义基础上，将来仍然像磐石般地站在这个基础上……不能把有利于各国和平共处的相互让步同原则上的让步，同涉及到我们社会主义制度、我们意识形态本质的让步混淆起来。这里根本谈不到任何让步和任何迁就。”
    看来，资本主义的保卫者不能或者是不愿了解这样一个简单的事实：两个制度的和平共处与竞赛不是谁的主观想像的结果，而是一种客观现实性。谁也不去问伯吉斯和他的同事们：他们是否“同意”和平共处，更不打算去同他们讨论这种共处的什么“先决条件”。社会主义和资本主义两大世界体系的共处，这是实际的事实，这是反映着国际舞台上现代力量对比的合乎规律的现象。
    资本主义世界的代表们幻想社会主义的地位会削弱，幻想苏联和其它社会主义国家的政治方针会改变。但是，地位越来越削弱的不是社会主义，而是资本主义，因此迫不得已而改变政府政策的也不是社会主义国家，而是资本主义国家，这是明摆着的事实。
    甚至西方不少还能清醒估计形势的资产阶级人士，现在也承认美国统治集团过去对一些极重要国际问题（包括美苏关系问题）所抱的态度是不现实的。因此，“解放”、“威慑”、“大规模报复”这些侵略性、挑衅性的主张遭到特别严厉的指责，大家都知道毫无根据地指望社会主义各国能改变现有的制度，或者至少是吓唬吓唬社会主义阵营各国，使它们在政策和思想意识范围内作原则性的让步，这些做法都是以上述主张为基础的。
    因此说，现在很少有人怀疑：美国有势力的人物和他们北大西洋公约组织中的伙伴们同时酝酿的这种计划不过是空中楼阁。削弱社会主义阵营的梦想完全被现实生活打破了。结果，华盛顿的一些人现在不得不对他们从前的政策，照他们的术语说，作“痛苦的重新估价”，使他们的政策适应世界舞台上发生的重大变化。
    但是，要问一句，既然公认美国政策策划人过去这些年抱着的所谓“解放”的主义已然破产，那末一些顽固不化的这一主义的信徒们有什么根据指望现在还能成功呢？现在社会主义阵营已更为有力和强大了，“实力地位”政策也遭到接二连三的失败。
    看来，现在西方指望在新的条件下从社会主义国家那里多少得到一些在“冷战”年代里得不到的东西，例如使用在社会主义国家积极宣传和加紧渗入“西方思想”的办法。
    资产阶级的思想家的出发点是：好像共产党人害怕同资本主义在思想方面竞争，似乎资产阶级的思想意识在广大人民群众中比社会主义思想意识有“更多”成功的“机会”。这是反动的、空洞的幻想。他们想使人类走回头路，回到一去不复返的过去时代。难道有人当真指望社会主义国家的工人、农民、劳动知识分子会同意这种赞扬资本主义奴役的“妙处”的反动念头吗？再没有比这种打算更荒唐和更可笑的了。
    共产主义思想取得了伟大的胜利，它在全世界获得越来越多的支持者。共产党人一直相信，而现在比过去任何时候更加深信，代表现代最先进的阶级——工人阶级的根本利益的共产主义思想意识，优越于已经腐朽的、历史注定必将灭亡的阶级——资产阶级的思想意识。
    连资产阶级的思想家，其中包括李普曼、托因比以及史蒂文森或鲍尔斯之类的政治活动家在内，都不得不承认资本主义在“争夺人心的战役”中遭到越来越大的失败。在资本主义国家里越来越多地发出关于“西方的没落”，关于同社会主义进行思想竞赛没有前途的胆战心惊的呼声。
    共产党人深信，关于什么样的制度——社会主义制度还是资本主义制度——更好；谁的思想——工人阶级的思想还是资产阶级的思想——更先进，因而在全世界范围内取得最后胜利这一历史性的争论，不能用而且也不应该用战争的方法，而是用和平的方法来解决。
    但是，资本主义的信徒们不要再用那种似乎共产党人诚心爱好和平表明思想斗争至少有了一点点“和缓”，表明共产党和工人党至少有些“离开”马克思列宁主义学说的根本原则的妄想来聊以自慰吧。
    这里回忆一下苏维埃国家的创始人列宁如何理解共产党人在两个体系和平共处和和平竞赛条件下的政策是合宜的。列宁指出，“我们既已从事和平建设，我们就要全力以赴，以便把它不间断地继续下去”。列宁号召共产党人时刻戒备着，他强调指出，对于工农成就的削弱“我们连一秒钟都无权容忍”。
    共产党人一向遵循了列宁主义的这些原则性的指示，而且今后仍将如此。
