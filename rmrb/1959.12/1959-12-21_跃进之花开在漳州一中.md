　　Leap Forward Flowers Bloom at Zhangzhou No. 1 Middle School

    The Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor has blossomed and borne fruit at Zhangzhou No. 1 Middle School in Fujian. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the school has been full of vitality, the mental outlook of teachers and students has been completely renewed, the quality of teaching has significantly improved, and students' exam results have also improved semester by semester.

    Resolutely Carry Out the Great Revolution in Education
    Zhangzhou No. 1 Middle School underwent a period of ideological struggle in implementing the Party's educational policy. Before last year, teachers and students at this school had varying degrees of misconceptions about the relationship between studying and labor, being "red" and "expert," theory and practice, and teachers and students. The phenomena of being divorced from production, divorced from reality, and neglecting politics were also quite serious. Many teachers only cared about teaching and not about educating people, thinking that teaching students to "understand" the books and get high scores was enough, and they did not pay attention to students' political and ideological education. In terms of teaching, they also rarely connected with reality. Students spent their days coping with homework and exams, and there was a mindset of rote learning, despising labor. When the Party's educational policy began to be implemented last year, although not many people openly opposed it, there were many kinds of resistant thoughts and remarks, such as some teachers saying, "If students participate in labor, they won't have time to do homework, which will affect the quality of teaching." At that time, the school's Party branch and administrative leaders analyzed this situation and realized that implementing the Party's educational policy was a profound revolution in education, a struggle between proletarian educational thought and bourgeois educational thought, and they must resolutely and proactively lead this struggle. Therefore, the school's Party branch led all teachers and students to repeatedly and conscientiously study the Party's educational policy and the Party committee's instructions, implement the Party's policy towards intellectuals, and launch debates on "red and expert," "theory and practice," "studying and labor," "the benefits of work-study programs," and "for whom to study," criticizing the bourgeois educational viewpoints, educational ideas, and teaching methods existing among teachers. Party branch members also went deep among teachers and students to conduct individual heart-to-heart talks, understand the problems existing in teaching and learning, and provide concrete assistance to some teachers who encountered practical difficulties in teaching. For example, some teachers in the science department only recited some outdated textbooks and formulas in the past, lacked practical operational experience, and were afraid of making a "fool" of themselves in on-site teaching. The Party branch encouraged teachers to study hard, boldly learn from workers and peasants, and enhance teachers' confidence in teaching good on-site lessons.

　　Opened Up Ways to Closely Integrate Education with Labor
    Zhangzhou No. 1 Middle School, in implementing the integration of education with production and teaching in connection with reality, went through a period of exploration and finally got on the right track. When the school started running farms and factories last year, it took some detours due to lack of experience. After repeated study, the school leaders finally clarified the difference between ordinary middle schools running farms and state-owned farms and vocational school internship farms, and realized that the task of ordinary middle schools running farms was primarily to improve teaching and improve the quality of teaching, and to cultivate students' labor habits and establish labor viewpoints through productive labor. The second purpose was production. After teachers and students clarified the purpose of running farms and participating in production, in terms of consolidating the farms, they designated the thirty acres of land on campus as a teaching experiment garden and flower and fruit nursery, and the farmland three kilometers from the city as a base for teachers and students to concentrate on rotating labor training. In terms of factories, they adjusted and expanded the carpentry factory, spice factory, and electric car workshop, and supplemented the equipment. This can better meet teaching needs. The time for teaching and productive labor has also been appropriately adjusted. After this improvement, teachers and students are very enthusiastic about labor. School leaders and teachers work with students as ordinary laborers. The principal said, "I am the principal and also the farm manager," and the class teachers said, "We are class teachers and also production team leaders." Now, every day after school in the afternoon, experimental fields, nurseries, breeding farms, etc., can be seen everywhere with teachers and students carrying manure, weeding, tilling, and washing pigsties.

    Various Teaching Methods
    The methods of integrating education with productive labor and connecting theory with practice at Zhangzhou No. 1 Middle School are diverse. They are carried out in the classroom or in the farm or factory, depending on the subject and the class. For example, when the biology department teaches a course on citrus cultivation, in accordance with the teaching requirements of botany, they first take students to the citrus specimen room to explain the economic value of citrus, the types of citrus, and the biological characteristics of citrus. Then, in the citrus seedling propagation area, they explain and demonstrate the cultivation methods of citrus seedlings. Then, using citrus trees of different ages, they explain and calculate the methods of citrus planting and orchard management techniques such as fertilization, soil cultivation, plowing, weeding, pruning, and pest control, so that students not only understand the theory of citrus cultivation, but also learn the entire process of citrus cultivation. Teachers also use specific examples to illustrate how the acquired theoretical knowledge can be applied in daily productive labor to solve problems in production. Students are very interested in this kind of teaching.

    In addition to conducting labor and basic knowledge education in the classroom, this school also uses the time to assign labor tasks or rest in the fields to guide students to review and consolidate the theoretical knowledge learned in the classroom during productive labor. For example, when sowing peanuts, they inspire students to recall the conditions for seed germination and the methods of sowing, so that students understand why peanuts cannot be sown on rainy days, why the soil should be plowed and leveled before sowing peanuts, and why the seeds should be gently trampled after sowing, etc., deepening students' understanding of textbook knowledge.

    Improve Teaching Quality Meticulously
    After the policy of combining education and productive labor was deeply implemented, Zhangzhou No. 1 Middle School leaders concentrated their leadership on meticulously preparing lessons and improving teaching methods in the first half of this year. Many teachers prepare lessons two weeks or even more in advance. Teachers have summarized three principles for lesson preparation: individual study, collective assistance, and teaching each other; and "seven requirements," namely, teaching tasks must be clear, key and difficult points must be mastered, textbook content must be thoroughly understood, student situations must be understood, teaching methods must be flexible, and details must be carefully considered. In addition, teachers should also provide careful guidance and pay attention to guidance methods. Teachers establish their own error card, math problem card, and student learning situation card. Giving full play to the role of activists among students, subject groups, and subject representatives is also an important aspect of doing a good job in tutoring.

    The Party branch of Zhangzhou No. 1 Middle School also attaches special importance to grasping political and ideological education in the classroom. Whenever the language class teaches articles with strong ideological content, such as "The Communist Style in Combat," before teaching, the Party member principal and the political class teacher participate in research and discussion together to specifically analyze the theme, purpose, and requirements. When teaching the article "Promote the Rapidly Growing Communist Spirit," they also invited comrades from the prefectural Party school to explain it. Under the direct leadership of the Party branch, this specific research on the text has greatly strengthened the ideology of the lectures.

    Peasants Praise Students as Good
    Due to the deep implementation of the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, constantly opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and strengthening the political and ideological education of teachers and students, the quality of teaching in this school has been continuously improved, and students have learned more comprehensive knowledge. At present, all students have learned techniques such as weeding, carrying burdens, fertilizing, intertillage, pest control, cutting branches, and layering. The atmosphere of loving science and engaging in scientific research is also very strong. Since last year, teachers and students have made more than 50 items such as universal seeders, wooden barrel pumps, air battery lamps, and daytime microscopic projectors. Some products have also been praised at exhibitions. Through productive labor, the mental outlook of teachers and students has also changed, their labor viewpoints have been enhanced, and their feelings for workers and peasants have increased. For example, teachers and students who go to the farm to work often take time to help farmers learn culture. Once, in the event of a rainstorm, students rushed to help farmers harvest the grain on the drying ground, and everyone was soaked to the skin. When the students returned to school, the whole village of farmers gave a collective send-off, sending the students more than five kilometers. In the manure accumulation movement in the countryside, many students ran to the stinkiest mud ponds to dig manure. They said, "The stinkier the manure, the better the fertilizer." The farmers along the way praised, "This group of students is really good!" Student Tang Yongxing felt that the efficiency of helping farmers shell peanuts was very low, so he designed a peanut shelling machine after returning to school, which helped farmers improve their labor efficiency, and the farmers welcomed it. Because learning is connected with reality, students' academic performance has also improved significantly. In the past, students in the first and second grades were divorced from production and reality, and there was nothing to write about when writing essays. They either wrote about eating and sleeping or copied excerpts from books. After participating in labor and connecting theory with practice, many works full of labor enthusiasm, love for life, and full of ideals appeared in writing. The teaching level of teachers has also been greatly improved. For example, the science teacher who used to be afraid of making a "fool" of himself because he lacked practical operational experience, learned a lot after personally throwing himself into the Great Leap Forward of steelmaking, and revised textbooks such as "Transmission Device" and "Power Machinery" based on his own operational experience, adding a lesson on the combination of indigenous and foreign methods in the chapter on steelmaking.

　　跃进之花开在漳州一中
　　巾章
    党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，已在福建漳州第一中学开花结果。自去年大跃进以来，这个学校一直是生气勃勃，师生精神面貌焕然一新，教学质量显著提高，学生考试的成绩也一学期比一学期好。
    坚决进行教育大革命
    漳州第一中学在贯彻党的教育方针中是经过一段思想斗争过程的。去年以前这个学校的师生对读书与劳动、红与专、理论与实际、师与生的关系等方面都存在着程度不同的错误认识，脱离生产、脱离实际和忽视政治的现象也相当严重。不少教师只管教书不管教人，认为把书教“会”学生考的分数高就行，不注意学生的政治思想教育。在教学方面也很少联系实际。学生天天应付作业，应付考试，存在有死念书，念死书，轻视劳动的思想。去年党的教育方针开始贯彻时，虽然公开反对的人不多，但各式各样的抵触思想和言论却不少，如有的教师说“学生参加劳动没有时间作作业，会影响教学质量”。当时学校党支部和行政领导分析了这个情况，认识到贯彻党的教育方针是教育上的深刻革命，是无产阶级教育思想和资产阶级教育思想的斗争，必须坚决主动地来领导这场斗争。因此学校党支部即领导全体师生反复认真地学习党的教育方针和党委的指示，贯彻党对知识分子的政策，开展了“红与专”“理论与实际”“读书与劳动”“勤工俭学的好处”“为谁学习”等辩论，批判教师中存在的资产阶级的教育观点、教育思想和教学方法。党支部委员还深入师生中进行个别谈心，了解教学和学习中存在的问题，对一些教师在教学中遇到的实际困难，给予具体帮助。如理化科有的教师过去只背诵一些陈旧的教材与公式，缺乏实际的操作经验，怕现场教课会出“洋相”。党支部就鼓励教师认真钻研，大胆向工农群众请教，增强教师教好现场课的信心。
　　开辟了教育紧密结合劳动的途径
    漳州第一中学在贯彻执行教育结合生产，教学联系实际方面，经过了一番摸索，终于走上正常轨道。去年学校开始办农场、工厂时，由于没有经验，曾走过一些弯路。学校领导经过反复学习，终于明确了普通中学办农场同国营农场和专业学校的实习农场的区别，认识到普通中学办农场的任务首先是为了改进教学、提高教学质量，通过生产劳动培养学生劳动习惯，树立劳动观点。第二个目的才是生产。师生明确举办农场和参加生产的目的以后，在整顿农场方面，把在校内的三十亩地作为教学实验园地和花果苗圃地，把距城三公里的农田作为师生集中轮流劳动锻炼的基地。在工厂方面调整和扩大了木工厂、香料厂和电机小车间，并充实了设备。这样就能更好地满足教学需要。教学和生产劳动的时间也作了适当的调整。经过这样改进后，师生劳动的劲头很大，学校领导和教师都以普通劳动者的身分和学生一起劳动，校长说“我是校长也是农场场长”，班主任说“我们是班主任也是生产队长”。现在每天一到下午课余时间，实验场、苗圃、饲养场等到处可以看到教师和学生在挑粪、除草、整地和洗扫猪栏。
    教学方式多种多样
    漳州第一中学教育与生产劳动结合、理论联系实际的方式是多样化的。他们根据不同的科目、不同的班级，有时在课堂上进行，有时在农场、工厂里进行。如生物科讲柑桔栽培课，按照植物学的教学要求先带学生到柑桔标本室，讲解柑桔的经济价值，柑桔的种类，柑桔的生物学特征，接着在柑桔育苗繁殖区讲解和演示柑桔苗木的培育方法，然后用不同树龄的柑桔讲解演算柑桔定植的方法和施肥、培土、中耕、除草、修剪、防治病虫害等果园管理技术，使学生既通晓柑桔栽培的理论，又学会柑桔栽培的整个过程。教师还通过一些具体事例来说明获得的理论知识如何应用在日常生产劳动中，以解决生产上的问题。这样的教学，学生很感兴趣。
    这个学校除了在课堂中进行劳动和基础知识教育外，在生产劳动中也利用布置劳动任务或田头休息时间引导学生复习巩固课堂所学过的理论知识。如在播种花生的时候启发学生回忆种子的萌发条件、播种的方法，使学生懂得为什么雨天不能播种花生，播种花生的时候为什么要先把地犁松耙平，种子播下以后为什么还要用脚轻轻踩实等道理，加深学生对书本知识的理解。
    精雕细刻地提高教学质量
    教育和生产劳动相结合的方针深入贯彻以后，今年上半年漳州第一中学领导上就把领导力量集中在精雕细刻地备好功课和改进教学方法方面。不少教师提前备好两周甚至更多时间的功课。教师们总结出备课的三个原则：个人钻研、集体帮助、教学相长；和“七要”，即教学任务要明确，重点难点要掌握，教材内容要熟透，学生情况要了解，教学方法要灵活，细节考虑要周到。此外教师还要认真辅导，注意辅导方法。教师自己建立错别字卡片、数学习题卡片、学生学习情况卡片。充分发挥学生中的积极分子，学科小组和科代表的作用，也是作好辅导工作的一个重要方面。
    漳州第一中学党支部还特别重视抓课堂上的政治思想教育。语文课每讲到思想性较强的课文，如“战斗中的共产主义风格”等的时候，在教学之前，党员校长和政治课教师都一起参加研究讨论，对主题思想、目的、要求进行具体分析。在讲“发扬正在飞速成长着的共产主义精神”一文时，还请地委党校的同志来讲解。在党支部直接领导下这种对课文的具体研究，使得讲课的思想性大大加强了。
    农民纷纷夸奖学生好
    由于深入贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，不断反右倾，鼓干劲，加强师生的政治思想教育，因此，这个学校的教学质量不断提高，学生学得的知识更加全面。目前所有学生都学会了锄草、挑担、施肥中耕、除虫、插枝压条等技术。热爱科学，大搞科学研究的气氛也十分浓厚。去年以来师生制成的东西有万能播种机、木筒式抽水机、空气电池灯、白天显微幻灯机等五十多件。有的产品在展览会上还得到好评。通过生产劳动师生的精神面貌也发生了变化，劳动观点增强了，对工农群众的感情增长了。如到农场劳动的师生经常抽空帮助农民学文化。有一次遇到暴雨，学生蜂涌而上帮助农民抢收晒场上的谷子，个个被雨淋得全身都湿透了。当学生回校时全村农民集体欢送，一直把学生送了五里多路。在农村的积肥运动中，不少学生跑到最臭的泥塘中去挖粪，他们说“愈臭肥愈好”，沿途农民赞扬说“这批学生真是好！”。学生汤永兴帮助农民剥花生，感到效率很低，回校后设计出一部剥花生机，帮助农民提高了劳动效率，农民很欢迎。由于学习联系了实际，学生的学习成绩也有显著提高。一二年级学生过去脱离生产，脱离实际，作文时没有什么可写，不是写吃饭睡觉，就是抄摘书本上的现成句子。经过参加劳动、理论联系实际后，写作中出现了不少充满劳动热情、热爱生活、富有理想的作品。教师的教学水平也有很大的提高。如过去怕没有实际操作经验会出“洋相”的理化教师，他亲身投入大炼钢铁运动后，学到许多东西，并根据自己的操作经验改编了“传动机”“动力机械”等教材，增加了炼钢一章中的土洋结合的一课。　　（附图片）
