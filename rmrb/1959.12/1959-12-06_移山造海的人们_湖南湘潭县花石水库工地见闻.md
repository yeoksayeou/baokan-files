The People Who Move Mountains and Create Seas
—A Glimpse of the Huashi Reservoir Construction Site in Xiangtan County, Hunan

Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Maoxing, Hu Jian

Several miles away from the Huashi Reservoir construction site, the clamor of voices and the rumbling of explosions could already be heard. Upon entering the construction site, we were deeply moved by the earth-shattering spirit of the commune members and the miracles they were creating by moving mountains and creating seas.

We followed a newly opened winding canal towards the reservoir construction site. In the past, reservoirs were built by first constructing the dam and then opening the canals. However, this reservoir is being built with the main dam and canals being constructed simultaneously this year, progressing side by side. Our guide said: This large canal, with a total length of fifty-two li, was originally planned to be completed in two months, but the entire commune mobilized, attacking it section by section, and it was completed in just eight nights. Now, all eight small reservoirs and more than 1,200 ponds and dams in the entire commune are connected in series. The entire commune's melon-on-a-vine-style irrigation network was formed even before the dam was completed.

In the command post on the hill to the right of the reservoir, we met Cheng Binghui, the first secretary of the commune's Party committee. He has been living on the construction site. The command post is on a small hill, from which you can see the tense and magnificent scene of semi-mechanized construction across the entire site. In the construction area, which is less than two li wide and long, three to four thousand people are working around the main dam. The main dam is already seven or eight meters high, and roads for vehicles and sidewalks have been opened on both sides. Trucks carrying earth come and go, dumping load after load of soil there. Then, large stone rollers weighing seven or eight thousand catties immediately roll over it, replacing the heavy labor of ramming the earth that used to require a lot of manpower. The earth rolled by the large stone rollers is very solid.

On the hillside to the left of the main dam, there are two dirt railway tracks. Twenty carriages run up and down, back and forth. These earth-carrying carriages only require four people to load the earth, and they transport more than 400 cubic meters of earth per day, increasing work efficiency by more than twenty times compared to carrying it by shoulder. Near the command post on the hill, three aerial cableways have also been erected. "Flying cars" loaded with mud shuttle back and forth in the air, operating more than a hundred times per hour, increasing work efficiency by more than ten times compared to carrying it by shoulder. Seeing these moving scenes, we are reminded of how much power tool reform has unleashed this year under the superior system of the people's commune. It is no wonder that the progress of water conservancy construction in various places is so rapid.

Suddenly, a bugle call sounded on the opposite mountain. This was the signal for earthwork blasting. The cadre in charge of safety at the construction site was already standing on the hill waving a red flag, asking people to evacuate to safe areas. After a while, with a loud bang, the ground shook, and mud and soil shot into the air. After the smoke cleared, it was clear that a solid earth hill had been blasted away for the most part. People loaded the shattered mud and soil onto trucks and transported it to the dam foundation.

Earthwork blasting is carried out here every day, and they have already used more than five tons of homemade explosives. Because the safety work on the construction site is well done, no personal injury accidents have ever occurred. The blasting team, composed of Communist Party member Hu Jianquan, demobilized soldier Peng Songru, and others, is specifically responsible for earthwork blasting and construction site safety. They can blast three to four hundred cubic meters of earth with one shot, increasing work efficiency by dozens of times compared to manual digging. Originally, there were three very large earth hills near the main dam, but now they have all been blasted into flat ground, and the mountain soil has been moved to the dam foundation.

The thatched shed of the command post on the hill suddenly shook, as if an earthquake had occurred. Upon inquiry, it turned out that the stonemasons in the culvert were blasting stone again. Originally, the reservoir's drainage culvert was to be made of reinforced concrete. Because the supply of reinforced concrete was temporarily unavailable, someone came up with a good idea: to excavate this stone mountain to make a culvert, which would save materials and be stronger than reinforced concrete. This is a large stone cave, eighty-seven meters long and nearly two meters in diameter, which has now been opened. Next to the stone cave is a temporary small power plant on the construction site, which is controlled by demobilized soldier Zhao Shugen with three pumping machine operators. Although this is a twelve-horsepower small generator, it can light more than a hundred electric lights, ensuring round-the-clock construction on the site.

In the stone cave, we interviewed Communist Youth League member Peng Shulin. This son of a poor peasant only learned to chisel stone and blast in last year's Great Leap Forward in steelmaking. However, he studied diligently and worked hard, and made rapid progress. After arriving at the construction site, he and veteran stonemasons Hong Fushi, Su Jiecai, and others studied how to improve work efficiency. They adopted methods such as deep-drilling boreholes and horizontal tunneling, and first created a high work efficiency of 1.2 meters per day, driving the work efficiency of the entire culvert construction area to increase by more than two times compared to before. When there was no fuse, he used leather wire threaded through small bamboo tubes as a primer, which was both moisture-proof and waterproof, and the effect was very good. Everyone praised him as a "blasting expert."

Who is the "mountain-moving strongman"? Secretary Cheng told us: It is the commune member Xu Xianhe, who pushes the cart and transports earth on the dam. As soon as the reservoir started construction, he invited five commune members to form a heroic team. Within a distance of 230 meters, they have maintained a high work efficiency of transporting an average of 17 cubic meters of earth per person per day for more than twenty days. Xu Xianhe's highest daily work efficiency in pushing the cart and transporting earth reached 20 cubic meters. The basket on his cart was large and full, and a pile of soil dumped on the dam foundation was a large pile. Because he led more than 300 people to move a small earth hill in more than twenty days, the glorious title of "mountain-moving strongman" spread throughout the construction site.

When we went to visit Xu Xianhe, he was eating lunch on a hillside outside the dam foundation. The vegetables were very plentiful, a large bowl of cabbage mixed with taro, and a bowl of tofu jerky fried with chili peppers. The laborers happily told us that there were enough vegetables to eat this year on the construction site, and they constantly praised the commune Party committee for grasping the life of the construction site early and well. It turned out that as early as two months before the start of the reservoir construction, the commune transferred more than 500 people to grow more than 300 mu of vegetables on the construction site, and also prepared enough firewood to burn for half a month. Living such a life on the reservoir construction site was something that many laborers had not originally expected.

During the rest time after the meal, we had the opportunity to chat with Xu Xianhe. Old Xu is not tall, but he is full of energy when he works, and he speaks decisively: "If you do your own thing, how can you not work hard?" He said: "Repairing the pond in winter and enjoying the coolness in summer. We are most afraid of drought here. This year, we watered the fields for a full fifty-seven days to save the seedlings." He stood up and pointed to the valley and said to us, "In the winter of 1957, they wanted to build a small reservoir in this valley. They only planned to use 30,000 workdays, but at that time, the agricultural cooperative only had more than 100 households, and the strength was small, so they did not dare to do it. Now that the people's commune has been established, there are many people in the commune, and a large reservoir with more than 500,000 workdays can be built with just one shout."

The lights on the construction site lit up, and the laborers taking the night shift continued to fight on the construction site. They are as numerous as the laborers on the day shift. Although it is early winter and the late night air is biting, they are all hot and steaming. At this time, some of the laborers on the day shift are watching movies, and some are still insisting on working. Hu Qingfan, a Communist Party member from the Malong Brigade, and his wife Jiang Ruiying are in full swing carrying out a high-efficiency competition between husband and wife. The secretary of the brigade's general branch came and gave an order, and the couple stopped working and went to watch a movie on the earthen dam together.

    移山造海的人们
    ——湖南湘潭县花石水库工地见闻
    新华社记者　张茂兴　胡坚
    离花石水库工地还有几里路，就听到人声喧嚷和阵阵轰鸣的爆破声。进入水库工地，看到社员们那种气吞山河的气概和他们创造的移山造海奇迹，更是深深地被感动了。
    我们沿着新开的弯弯曲曲的渠道走向水库工地。过去，修水库都是先修大坝后开渠道的，但是这座水库今年却是主坝与渠道同时动手，齐头并进。领我们参观的人说：这条全长五十二里的大渠道，原计划两个月修成，结果全社动员，分段突击，八个晚上就修好了。现在全公社范围的八个小型水库、一千二百多处塘坝通通串连起来。全公社长藤结瓜式的灌溉网，就在大坝尚未完工的时候，已经形成了。
    在水库右侧山头指挥所里，我们会见了公社党委第一书记成炳辉。他一直住在工地上。指挥所在一个不很高的小山上，站在山上正好看到整个工地半机械化施工的紧张而雄伟的场面。在宽、长不到两里路的工区里，有三、四千人围绕着主坝劳动，主坝已有七、八米高了，它的两边都开辟了一条条的车子道和人行道，运土的车子一来一去地来回奔驰着，把一车一车的泥土倒在那里。接着，七、八千斤重的大石碾马上压过来，代替了过去要许多劳力夯土的繁重劳动，大石碾压过的土非常结实。
    在主坝左边山坡上，有两条土火车道。二十个车厢一上一下，来回奔驰。这种运土车厢只需要四个人装土，每天运土四百多立方米，比肩挑工效提高二十多倍。在山头指挥所的附近还架设了三道高空索道，装泥的“飞车”在空中来往穿梭，每小时运转一百多次，比肩挑工效高十多倍。看到这些动人的情景，我们联想到今年在人民公社的优越制度下工具改革发挥了多么巨大的威力。对于各地水利施工进度为什么那么神速，也就毫不奇怪了。
    忽然，对面山上吹起了号角。这是土方爆破的信号。负责工地安全的干部已站在山头上招展着红旗，要人们到安全地带去回避。不一会，轰的一声，地动山摇，泥土冲到半空。烟幕消失后，才清楚地看到结实的土山头已给炸掉大半边，人们把炸碎的泥土装上车子，运到坝基上去了。
    这里每天都要进行土石方的爆破，光是他们自己造的土炸药已经用了五吨多，因为工地安全工作做得好，工地从未发生过人身事故。由共产党员胡鉴泉、转业军人彭松如等组成的爆破小组，专门负责土方爆破和工地安全工作。他们一炮要炸三、四百方土，比人力挖土的工效要提高好几十倍。原来主坝附近有三个很高大的土山头，现在都炸成平地，把山土搬到坝基上去了。
    山头指挥所草棚忽然震得摇晃晃的，仿佛发生了地震，一打听原来是涵洞里的石工们又在放炮炸石了。本来水库的放水涵洞是要用钢筋水泥的。因为钢筋水泥一时供应不上，有人想出一个好主意：打通这座石山来做涵洞，既省材料，又比钢筋水泥坚固。这是一条八十七米长，将近两米直径的大石洞，现在已打通了。石洞旁边有一个工地的临时小发电厂，由转业军人赵树根带着三个抽水机手在掌握，虽然这是十二马力的小发电机，但能点一百多盏电灯，保证了工地日夜轮班施工。
    在石洞里，我们访问了共青团员彭树林。这位贫农的儿子，是在去年大炼钢铁运动中才学会凿石放炮的。可是他勤学苦干，进步很快。来到工地后，他就和老石工洪富十、苏界成等研究如何提高工效，他们采取深挖炮眼和打横洞等办法，首先创造了日进一点二米的高工效，带动整个涵洞工区工效都较原来提高两倍多。在没有导火线的时候，他用皮线穿在小竹筒子里作引子，既不怕潮又不怕水，效果很好。人人夸他是位“爆破能手”。
    “搬山大力士”是谁呢？成书记告诉我们：就是在大堤上推车运土的社员徐先和。水库一开工他就邀集了五个社员成立了一个英雄小组，在二百三十米的运距内，二十多天来一直保持着每天每人平均运土十七立方米的高工效，徐先和推车运土的日工效最高达到二十立方米。他车子上的车箩大、装得满，一车土倒到坝基上就是一大堆，因为他带动三百多人在二十多天中就搬掉了一座小土山，“搬山大力士”的光荣称号，就在工地上传开了。
    我们去访问徐先和的时候，他正在坝基外面一个山坡上吃午饭。蔬菜很丰盛，一大钵白菜拌芋头，还有一碗辣椒炒豆腐干。民工们高兴地告诉我们，今年工地上蔬菜真够吃个饱，他们不断称赞公社党委对工地生活抓得早、抓得好。原来早在水库开工前两个月，公社就抽调五百多人在工地种菜三百多亩，还准备了足够烧半个月的柴火。在水库工地上过到这样的生活，这是许多民工原来没有想到的。
    在饭后休息的时间里，我们才有机会和徐先和攀谈起来。老徐个子不高，干起活来却浑身是劲，讲起话来斩钉截铁：“做自己的事，那能不发狠干”。他说：“冬天修塘，夏天乘凉。我们这里最怕干，今年整整车了五十七天水，才救出禾苗”。他站起来指着山谷对我们说，1957年冬天，他们就想在这山谷里修个小水库，只计划用三万个工，但是当时农业社只有一百多户，力量小，不敢动手。现在办起人民公社，社大人多，五十多万个工的大水库，一声喊叫就修起来了。
    工地上电灯亮起来了，接晚班的民工继续在工地战斗着。他们和日班的民工一样多，虽然是初冬深夜，寒气逼人。可是他们一个个都是热气腾腾。这时，做日班的民工有的看电影，有的还是坚持着干活。马龙大队共产党员胡庆凡和他的爱人姜瑞英开展夫妻高工效竞赛正在劲头上，大队总支书记赶来下了命令，夫妻俩才收了工，双双到土坝上看电影去了。
