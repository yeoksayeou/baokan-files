There's a folk saying that goes, "The harvest depends on the sowing; next year depends on this winter." This saying means that a good harvest is first determined by good sowing, and next year's bumper harvest depends on this year's preparations. The facts of agricultural production development over the past two years have further proven the correctness of this saying. Last year's Great Leap Forward and this year's continued leap forward both began with the bumper harvest of summer crops. The reason why summer crops have been able to continuously improve and leap again and again is because a solid foundation was laid for the second year's bumper harvest starting from the previous winter. This year's winter wheat is not only sown in a timely manner, with an area and progress that greatly exceed last year, but also the sowing quality exceeds any previous year. The most prominent feature is that various localities have planned a large number of "high-yield plots," high-yield areas, and high-yield fields. The area of ​​high-yield plots, high-yield areas, and high-yield fields in various places generally accounts for 20% to 30% of the wheat field area, and some are even more. For example, Taiqian People's Commune in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, has established four 10,000-mu "high-yield plots" this year, requiring the output to reach 80% of the total wheat output of the entire commune. High-yield fields drive ordinary fields. This year, the measures for ordinary fields are also more specific and thorough than last year. The masses reflect that "there are no third-class seedlings to be seen in this year's wheat," and the strong wheat seedlings are gratifying. The current slogan should be "Looking to next year by observing this winter." We must manage the wheat well this winter, seize the time for winter irrigation and fertilization, and create conditions for next year's wheat bumper harvest.

Why is it that this year's winter wheat sowing work can be done so much, so fast, so early, and so well? The most fundamental reason is that it has fully utilized the superiority of the people's commune, rationally arranged labor, and taken the initiative in everything. The Party leadership organs in various localities have adhered to the spirit of continuous revolution. During this year's summer harvest, they discussed the issue of striving for a greater bumper harvest of summer crops next year. In this way, the leadership has more time to consider and formulate a production plan for next year's summer harvest crops, and the vast number of grassroots cadres and the masses can also fully deliberate and discuss, revise the production plan for summer harvest crops, and formulate specific measures. The more adequate the preparation, the more in-depth the mass work, the more meticulous the sowing work. Another reason is that the yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing and close planting adopted during this year's summer crop sowing are all based on local successful experiences and have been formulated after careful observation for the past two years. Therefore, they are more reasonable, and the yield-increasing effect will be even greater. This year's winter wheat fields are generally deeply ploughed to a depth of six inches to one foot, with 5,000 to 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and a seeding rate of 15 to 20 jin per mu. The standards for high-yield fields are even higher. Various localities have comprehensively implemented the Eight-Character Charter in accordance with local specific conditions and experience. This is the basic guarantee for next year's wheat bumper harvest.

However, to achieve next year's wheat bumper harvest, a series of tasks must be done. Among them, the most important is wheat field management. Therefore, earnestly doing a good job in winter field management of wheat has become an urgent task for current agricultural production.

This year's wheat is well planted. Generally, deep plowing, the use of improved varieties, increased fertilization, and rational close planting have been implemented in ordinary wheat fields. Rational close planting facilitates intertillage, soil cultivation, and pest control; the ridge and furrow system in wheat fields and large-scale high-yield plots facilitate centralized management and the adoption of new measures and new technologies. We must fully utilize these good conditions and adopt more rigorous and meticulous management methods than in the past. We must pay attention to the growth of wheat seedlings at all times, and solve problems immediately upon discovery. For example, if a certain area has an outbreak of pests and diseases, we must immediately organize forces to thoroughly eliminate them; otherwise, if they spread, it will cause losses. For example, this year, due to early sowing, sufficient base fertilizer, and the implementation of close planting, wheat has more tillers before winter, which is good, but it is also prone to the phenomenon of "winter lushness." It can be seen that with the favorable conditions of good sowing, there must also be corresponding good management methods, so that the good conditions can be fully utilized and the goal of a good harvest can be achieved.

How to do a good job in field management? Anguo County in Hebei Province has put forward such a slogan: "Revolution for eight months, battle for sixteen seasons." This slogan reflects a spirit of continuous revolution and tenacious struggle. They regard wheat field management as a revolutionary struggle in which advanced ideas defeat backward ideas. They propose "battle for sixteen seasons," which means to start from winter, seize every season in the wheat growth process, and carry out careful and meticulous management until the wheat is harvested. That is to say, to enable all cadres and the masses not to be satisfied with certain achievements already made, but to be able to always maintain soaring enthusiasm, and at the same time, according to the objective laws of wheat growth, carry out ideological work and management work in different stages. This is a very good method of ideological work.

In addition to grasping ideology, it is also necessary to grasp measures. Grasping measures means fully utilizing the people's commune's experience in organizing production and arranging labor, establishing a responsibility system in wheat field management, and ensuring that tasks are assigned to teams, measures are assigned to fields, and responsibilities are assigned to people. At the same time, in addition to regular management by dedicated personnel, when necessary, cooperation can also be organized under the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit to carry out blitz management, so as to combine regular professional management with blitz cooperation management.

With sufficient enthusiasm of the masses and concrete measures, the task of the leadership is to summarize and promote advanced experience in a timely manner, establish pacesetters, and carry out mass movements of appraisal and competition. Specific struggle slogans and tasks should be put forward at each stage, and inspections should be carried out regularly. Not only should inspections be carried out at a certain stage or a critical point in wheat growth, but also the people's thoughts should be constantly concerned. Good thoughts should be encouraged; bad thoughts should be criticized and helped to be corrected. In addition, it is also necessary to check whether the measures are practical and feasible, and whether some measures are adapted to the new situation. Corresponding modifications or supplements should be made to some measures according to the actual situation. Only by grasping inspection and supervision can wheat field management work be done better and better, and more and more meticulously.

This year's wheat seedlings are growing better than any previous year. We must seize this great opportunity, mobilize the masses, and use the winter to manage it even better, so as to lay the foundation for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year.

### 明年看今冬

    明年看今冬
    民间流传着这样一句话：“收获看耕种，明年看今冬。”这句话的意思是说，收获的好坏首先决定于耕种的好坏，明年的丰收决定于今年的准备工作。两年来农业生产发展的事实，更加证明了这句话的正确性。去年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进，都是从夏收作物大丰收开始的。夏收作物所以能够连年提高、一跃再跃，就是因为从头一年的冬天就为第二年的丰收打下了结实基础。今年的冬小麦不但播种适时，面积和进度大大超过了去年，而且播种质量也超过了以往任何一年。最突出的一个特点是各地规划了大批的“丰产方”、丰产片、丰产田。各地丰产方、丰产片、丰产田的面积一般占麦田面积的20％到30％，有的更多。如山东寿张县台前公社，今年搞了四个万亩“丰产方”，要求产量达到占全社小麦总产量的80％。丰产田带动了一般田，今年，一般田的措施也比去年具体、周密，群众反映，“今年麦子看不到三类苗”，麦苗茁壮是可喜的。现在的口号应当是“明年看今冬”，一定要在今年冬天把麦子管好，及时抓紧冬灌和施肥，为明年小麦丰收创造条件。
    为什么今年冬小麦的播种工作能够做到又多又快又早又好呢？最根本的原因是充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，合理安排了劳动力，事事提前，步步主动。各地党的领导机关坚持了不断革命的精神，在今年夏收的时候，就讨论了争取明年夏季作物更大丰收的问题。这样，领导上就有比较多的时间来考虑拟定明年夏收作物生产计划，广大基层干部和群众也能够充分酝酿、讨论，修订夏收作物生产计划，制定具体措施。准备工作愈充分，群众工作愈深入，播种工作就愈细致。另一个原因是，今年夏收作物播种时所采取的深耕、密植等增产措施，都是根据当地的成功经验，并且经过两年来细心观察的结果而拟定出来的，因而更加合理，增产的效果也将更大。今年冬小麦田普遍深耕六寸到一尺，基肥每亩五千到一万斤，播种量每亩十五斤到二十斤。丰产田标准更高一些。各地按照当地具体条件和经验全面地执行了八字宪法。这是明年小麦丰收的基本保证。
    但是要实现明年小麦丰收，还得做一系列的工作。其中最主要的是麦田管理工作。因此，认真做好小麦冬季田间管理工作，就成为当前农业生产的紧迫任务。
    今年麦子种得好，一般麦田实行了深耕、选用良种、增施肥料和合理密植。密植合理便于进行中耕、培土、治虫；麦田的畦田化和大面积的丰产方，更便于进行集中管理，便于采用新措施、新技术。我们要充分运用这些好条件，采取比过去更严密、更细致的管理方法。时时刻刻注意麦苗的生长情况，一发现问题就要立即解决。例如有一块地方发生了病虫害，就要立即组织力量彻底扑灭；否则，蔓延开来，就会造成损失。又如今年由于播种早，底肥足，实行了密植，小麦冬前分蘖多，这是好的，但是也容易发生“冬旺”现象。可见，有了播种得好的有利条件，还必须要有相应的好的管理方法，好条件才能充分发挥作用，才能达到收得好的目的。
    怎样做好田间管理工作呢？河北省安国县提出了这样一个口号：“革命八个月，战斗十六节”，这个口号反映出一种不断革命、顽强战斗的精神。他们把麦田管理看作是一场先进思想战胜落后思想的革命斗争。他们提出“战斗十六节”，就是要从冬天作起，抓住小麦生长过程中的每一个节令，加以认真、细致的管理，直到麦子收上场为止。就是说，要使所有的干部和群众不因某些既得的成就而满足，都能够经常保持冲天的干劲，同时，按照小麦生长的客观规律，分别不同的阶段进行思想工作和管理工作。这是一种很好的思想工作的方法。
    除了抓思想以外，还需要抓措施。抓措施，就是要充分利用人民公社在组织生产、安排劳力方面的经验，在小麦的田间管理上建立责任制，做到任务到队、措施到田、责任到人。同时，除了经常性的专人专责管理以外，必要时还可以在互助互利的原则下，组织协作，进行突击性管理，做到经常性的专业管理和突击性的协作管理相结合。
    群众干劲足，措施又具体，领导的任务就是要及时总结推广先进经验、树立标兵、开展评比竞赛的群众运动。应当在每个阶段提出具体的斗争口号和任务，要经常进行检查。不仅每到小麦生长的一定阶段或一个关口，进行检查，同时也要经常关心人们的思想，对于好的思想，要鼓励；对于不好的思想，要批判、帮助纠正。此外，还要检查措施是否切实可行，有些措施是否适应新的情况？要根据实际情况对一些措施作相应的修改或补充。只有抓紧了检查和督促，才能使麦田管理工作愈做愈好、愈做愈细。
    今年的麦苗比以往任何一年都长得好。我们要抓住这个大好形势，发动群众，利用冬季把它管理得更好，为明年农业生产的继续跃进打下基础。
