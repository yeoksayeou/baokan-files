Since the establishment of the Third Red Flag People's Commune in Tekes County, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Kirgiz and Kazakh nomads who have lived nomadic lives all year round have all settled down. This is a great happy event on the grassland.

After liberation, with the development of cooperatives and the increase in production, many herdsmen have moved out of the deep mountains and settled down. However, because the cooperatives were small, the planning of production and the organization of nomadic life were restricted. Only after the establishment of the people's commune was the problem of settling nomads fundamentally solved.

The settlement of nomads has promoted the development of production, and the lives of nomads have also been improved. Now that the autumn harvest and winter preparations have ended, a winter production upsurge is being set off in the residential areas. (Attached pictures)

    Lambing in the harsh winter is something that has never happened here before. Since the beginning of winter, the commune has prepared sufficient forage and good sheds for ewes that produce three litters in two years and two litters in one year. This is a group of pregnant ewes from the animal husbandry brigade.
    Female commune members are very concerned about the lambs and are artificially feeding weak lambs.
    After settling down, such large cabbages grew for the first time on the land of the pastoral area. The commune canteen has stored hundreds of thousands of catties of vegetables in preparation for the winter.
    Telephones have been installed in the settlements of each production brigade of the commune; concentrated residence is more conducive to directing production and organizing the lives of commune members. This is Mukasi (Kyrgyz), the secretary of the Third Red Flag People's Commune, conveying to the production team the instructions from the higher authorities on winter production.
    The settlement of nomads has promoted the development of production and the improvement of life. This year, the commune's agricultural production has achieved a bumper harvest, and it has changed from a grain-deficient commune to a grain-surplus commune. The lives of the herdsmen are stable, and the enthusiasm of the commune members for production is even higher. This is the commune member of the Third Production Brigade, braving the severe cold to split mountains and dig canals, and build water conservancy projects.
    A iron and wood factory has been set up in the settlement to repair farm tools for the commune members. In the past, even the simplest farm tools would have to be taken to the county town, more than 60 miles away from the commune, for repair.

    牧民定居以后

    新疆维吾尔自治区伊犁哈萨克族自治州特克斯县第三红旗人民公社成立以来，常年过着游牧生活的柯尔克孜族和哈萨克族牧民已经全部定居了。这是草原上的一件大喜事。
    解放后，随着合作社的发展和生产的提高，已有不少牧民搬出深山定居下来。但因为合作社规模小，规划生产和组织牧民定居生活受到限制。只是在人民公社建立以后，牧民定居问题才从根本上解决了。
    牧民定居促进了生产的发展，牧民生活也得到改善。现在，秋收和过冬准备工作已经结束，居民点里正在掀起冬季生产高潮。（附图片）
     在严冬接育小羔是这里过去从没有过的事情。入冬以来，公社已为两年三产和一年两产的母羊准备了充足的草料和良好的圈棚。这是畜牧大队的一群待产母羊。
    女社员对小羊羔十分关心，正给瘦弱的小羔进行人工哺乳。
    定居以后，在牧区的土地上第一次长出了这样大的洋白菜。公社食堂已经储存了几十万斤蔬菜准备过冬。
    公社各生产大队的定居点里都安上了电话；居住集中更加便于指挥生产和组织社员生活。这是第三红旗人民公社的秘书木卡西（柯尔克孜族）正在向生产队传达上级对冬季生产的指示。
    牧民定居促进了生产的发展和生活的改善。今年公社农业生产获得丰收，由缺粮社变成了余粮社。牧民生活安定，社员生产情绪更高。这是第三生产大队的社员，正冒着严寒劈山凿渠，兴修水利。
    定居点里办起了铁木工厂替社员检修农具。过去这里连最简单的农具坏了，也要拿到离公社六十多里的县城去修。
