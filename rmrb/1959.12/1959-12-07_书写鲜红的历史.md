    Writing a Vivid Red History
    Wei Wei
    In our country of emerging heroes, a new bright star has appeared: this is Du Fengrui. He is an outstanding example of the People's Air Force soldier.
    What kind of person can be a good air force soldier? In my opinion, he must first have extraordinary courage. A weak and fearful person will not be a qualified soldier in any military branch, and even more so in the air force, in our ranks of iron eagles. Just imagine, in the vast sea of clouds, a sudden burst of thunder and lightning for ten thousand miles, away from the supervision of superiors, if there is no heroic spirit, no real courage, it is difficult to complete the people's trust. On October 10th last year, in the fierce battle over Longtian, Fujian, we saw what kind of brave warrior Du Fengrui was. When his lead plane was attacked, he fearlessly rushed into the enemy formation, killing an enemy plane. Subsequently, his plane was seriously damaged. In this critical moment, he did not hesitate, driving the smoking war eagle, swiftly pursuing the enemy, and finally shot down the enemy plane, causing it to explode in mid-air. Only when his plane could no longer be controlled did he decide to parachute. What a brave and fearless warrior! The martyr's words and deeds before his death prove that this courage comes from a high degree of awareness, from a high degree of hatred for the enemy, and from infinite love for the Party, the people, and his comrades. Only courage built on this ideological foundation can be called true courage, and it is also the most solid and firm.
    Secondly, we see that the martyr's most prominent spiritual characteristic is his great collectivist spirit, to the point of the noble character of sacrificing himself to save others. Collectivist spirit is so necessary for our air force eagles! We not only need hunters who are good at fighting, but especially a flock of eagles armed with the spirit of communism, capable of winning every battle!
    In learning from Comrade Du Fengrui, everyone unanimously pointed out his firmness and loyalty to the Party's line. He not only practiced it himself, but also constantly advised and encouraged his family to take the socialist road. This shows that Comrade Du Fengrui did not stay at the level of a liberated peasant's consciousness, but was already a firm fighter with communist consciousness and proletarianized. Some comrades were brave and decisive during the democratic revolution, but when the revolution became more in-depth, when the socialism we had longed for for many years arrived, they became flustered, hesitant, and wavered, and even could not pass the threshold of socialism. Comrade Du Fengrui, on the other hand, was a clear example of wholeheartedly supporting the General Line.
    In the history of our people's revolution, in our revolutionary army, how many heroic figures have emerged! Their heroic spirit of overwhelming all enemies was simply like the courage of giants. Their selfless heart was as transparent as crystal. Every time we hear about their deeds and talk about their qualities, we are always deeply moved. Now, let us think about how these heroic figures, their noble moral qualities, were forged. Is their giant-like height forever unattainable? Can we ordinary people acquire their qualities and become like them?
    There are no born heroes in the world. Heroic figures like Dong Cunrui, Liu Hulan, Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, Xiang Xiuli, An Yemin, Du Fengrui, etc., are all ordinary people, our companions of yesterday. Their noble moral qualities are not innate, but are created by various objective and subjective reasons. The so-called objective reasons include the class soil that nurtured him, the environment he was in, the education and influence he received; the so-called subjective reasons are the attitude he took and the efforts he made towards the influence of this objective environment. There is no doubt that the influence of the objective environment is extremely important. For example, Comrade Du Fengrui, if he had not participated in the revolutionary struggle, if he had not had the Party's teachings, if the ideal of communism had not ignited the spark in his heart, he would never have grown into the hero he is now. Perhaps he might have become a hero, but only a farmer-type hero, not a proletarian-style heroic figure. Taking ourselves as an example, it is the same. If it were not for the Party's teachings, the influence of the revolutionary army's style, and the help of comrades, we would still be living in the mire of the old society, and we ourselves would find it hard to imagine what kind of person we would have become now. Therefore, we say that the objective environment and its influence play a decisive role in general; however, under the same environment, whether a revolutionary progresses or falls behind depends on the individual's subjective efforts. Look at many people who come from roughly the same background, have roughly the same environment, and participate in the revolution at roughly the same time, they receive the same Party education, why are there such great differences after several years? Why have some people become so strong and so loyal, while others remain the same? Why are some people's revolutionary positions becoming more and more firm, while others' "rebellious bones" are becoming harder and harder, even becoming right-wing elements? Is it that the Party's education is biased? No, the Party treats each of her children like a biological mother, and cherishes every soldier in her ranks like the all-illuminating sun. The reason why this situation occurs is a matter of the revolutionary's personal subjective efforts, that is, the attitude each of them takes towards the Party's teachings.
    Comrade Du Fengrui's history can help us find this answer. He wrote in his diary: "I deeply realize that in doing every task, completing every mission, even in carrying out every study, it is very necessary to listen to the Party, listen to the leaders, and strive for the leaders' help and support. Whatever the Party and the leadership tell me to do, I will do it without reservation according to the instructions of the Party and the leadership." He also said: "What is the reason why some people are slow to make ideological progress and have poor work performance? I think there is only one reason, and that is that they think they are right, do not get close to the leadership, do not listen to the leadership, and cannot correct their own wrong views, and cannot sincerely accept the correct opinions of the leadership. I deeply realize that I can only make progress by relying on the Party, otherwise I will fall behind." This is the attitude Comrade Du Fengrui took towards the Party's teachings. With the Party's leadership and his loyalty to the Party, he was able to ride the wind and waves and move forward bravely on the road of life, being a good soldier in the army, a good student in school, and finally growing into a great communist fighter.
    Our mature and wise Party is constantly caring for and teaching us; the excellent qualities of the working people are constantly influencing us; the heroic and model deeds of our partners are constantly encouraging us; socialist construction and the socialist revolutionary movement are unfolding before us like waves; the poisonous remnants left over from the old society, although still have a great influence, but they have long become despised and illegal things: is such an environment not a good environment? Are such conditions not good objective conditions? The problem is that even if the road is good, we still need to walk it with our own feet. Even if communist thought is good, it will not fly into our minds and take root on its own. There will be no physical or chemical method that will make the individualistic filth in our minds disappear all at once. In a word, subjective effort is an important issue. We see that Comrade Du Fengrui has such a serious attitude towards life practice. He wrote in another diary entry: "Everyone's life from adulthood to the moment of stopping breathing, for decades, constitutes each person's own history. As for whether the color painted on the historical picture of each person is white, gray, pink, or bright red, although objective factors play a certain role, subjective factors play a decisive role. Everyone is writing their own history every moment. Every Party member and Communist Youth League member should think carefully about how to write their own history. Every Party member and Communist Youth League member should always use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to their own thoughts and actions, and truly achieve consistency between words and deeds. I want to always maintain the bright red color of my own history." How well said! It is truly awakening and inspiring! From these words, we seem to see a great image, a warrior with an exceptionally clear and firm mind walking the road of life seriously with big strides. Now we can comfort the martyr's spirit and say: Dear comrade, you have completely fulfilled your vow before your death. Your history is a page of bright red history! Your life is a red life! It is as red as flowers, as red as raging fire, as red as the blood you shed in the blue sky of the motherland, loyal to the Party and loyal to the people!
    Comrades! Let us think about what kind of colors are painted in our history? Is it bright red, or is it a light pink color? Or is it mixed with some white and gray spots? I don't know how everyone will answer this question. Perhaps in retrospect, you will feel excited, or perhaps you will feel ashamed. But discouragement and sighing are of no help, the past days have passed like flowing water. Only by making up your mind, sincerely and conscientiously, can you write bright red chapters in the future with your sincerity and loyalty. However, if the fundamental problem is not solved, even if you make up your mind, those white and gray spots may still tarnish our history. This fundamental problem is the issue of outlook on life. That is to say, in the depths of our hearts, are we living for ourselves and for a few people? Or are we living for the collective, for the majority of people, for our great people's cause? Is it better for our brains to be transformed into "state-owned"? Is it better to be transformed into "privately owned"? Or is it better to turn it into a "public-private partnership" small grocery store? Comrades! Only when we firmly establish a communist outlook on life can the ship of life have the correct direction, and even if there is a pervasive mist, it will not lose its course. Only then can our history be written in bright red. Let every red revolutionary warrior write a vivid red history with the great pen of loyalty! This is the conclusion that should be drawn from learning from Martyr Du Fengrui.

    书写鲜红的历史
    魏巍
    在我们英雄辈出的国家里，出现了一颗新的亮星：这就是杜凤瑞。他是人民空军战士的卓越榜样。
    什么样的人才能做一个好的空军战士呢？据我想，他首先必须具有非凡的勇敢。一个软弱怕死的人，在任何兵种里都不会是一个合格的战士，而在空军里，在我们铁鹰的战列中，就更是这样。试想，在那云海茫茫的高空，一刹时风雷万里，离开上级的监督，如果没有英雄的气概，没有真正的勇敢，就决难完成人民的信托。去年10月10日，在福建龙田上空的激战中，我们看到杜凤瑞是一位怎样的勇士。当他的长机遭到攻击，他奋不顾身地冲入敌阵，扑杀了一架敌机，随后他的飞机负了重伤。在这危急的时刻里，他毫不犹豫，驾驶着冒烟的战鹰，迅猛地追迫敌人，终于将敌机打得凌空爆炸。直到他的飞机再也不能操纵的时候，他才决定跳伞。这是多么勇敢无畏的战士！烈士生前的言行证明，这种勇敢，来源于高度的觉悟，来源于对敌人高度的憎恨与对党、对人民、对战友的无限热爱。只有建立在这种思想基础上的勇敢，才称得起真正的勇敢，也才是最坚实、最牢固的。
    其次，我们看到，烈士最显著的精神特征，就是他那伟大的集体主义精神，以至舍己救人的崇高品德。集体主义精神，对于我们的空军鷙鹰们是多么必要！我们不仅需要善于搏击的猎手，而尤其需要被共产主义精神所武装的百战百胜的鹰群！
    在向杜凤瑞同志学习中，大家一致指出他对党的路线的坚定和忠诚。他不但自己身体力行，而且时刻劝导、鼓舞自己的家庭走社会主义道路。这说明杜凤瑞同志没有停留在翻身农民的觉悟水平，而已经是具有共产主义觉悟的、无产阶级化了的坚定战士。有些同志，在民主革命阶段，是勇敢坚决的，但是当革命更加深入的时候，当我们多年渴望的社会主义到来的时候，却反而张皇失措，犹疑动摇，甚至过不了社会主义这道关口。而杜凤瑞同志则与此相反，他是满腔热忱拥护总路线的鲜明榜样。
    在我们人民革命的历史上，在我们的革命军队里，曾经出现了多少英雄人物！他们那压倒一切敌人的英雄气概，简直像巨人一般的勇敢。他们那毫无自私自利的心，简直像水晶石一般的透明。每当我们听到他们的事迹，谈起他们的品质，总给人以深深的感动。现在，让我们来想一下，这些英雄人物，他们那种崇高的道德品质，究竟是怎样铸成的呢？难道他们那种巨人般的高度是永远不可企及的吗？我们一般人能不能获得他们那样的品质，也成为像他们那样的人呢？
    世界上并没有天生的英雄。像董存瑞、刘胡兰、黄继光、丘少云、向秀丽、安业民、杜凤瑞等等英雄人物，他们都是普通人，是我们昨天的伙伴。他们那种崇高的道德品质，也不是生来就具有的，都是由种种的客观原因和主观原因所造成。所谓客观原因，这里包括生长他的阶级土壤，他所处的环境，他所受到的教育和影响；所谓主观原因，就是他对这种客观环境影响，所采取的态度，所作的努力。客观环境的影响，毫无疑问，关系是异常巨大的。例如杜凤瑞同志，假若不是他参加了革命斗争，假若没有党的教导，假若不是共产主义的理想煽起了他心灵的火花，他决不可能成长为现在这样的英雄。也许有可能成为英雄，但只能是农民类型的英雄，却不会是无产阶级式的英雄人物。拿我们自己作比，也是一样。假若不是党的教导，革命部队作风的影响，同志们的帮助，仍然是生活在旧社会的泥淖中，到现在我们自己都难以想像会变成一个怎样的人。因此，我们说，客观环境及其影响，从总的方面说是有决定作用的；但是，在同样的环境之下，一个革命者进步与落后，却取决于个人的主观努力。请看许多出身大体相同，环境大体相同，参加革命早晚也差不多的人们，他们同样受到党的教育，为什么若干年后会有极大的差异呢？为什么有些人变得那么坚强，那么忠心耿耿，而另一些人却是依然故我呢？为什么有些人革命立场愈来愈坚定，而另一些人的“反骨”也愈来愈硬，甚至成为右派分子呢？难道党的教育是厚此薄彼吗？否，党是像亲生母亲一样对待她的各个儿女的，是像普照的阳光一样爱抚着她行列里的每一个战士的。其所以发生这种情况，这是革命者个人主观努力的问题，也就是他们每个人对党的教导采取什么态度的问题。
    杜凤瑞同志的历史，可以帮助我们找到这种答案。他在日记里写道：“我深刻认识到，做每一件工作，完成每一项任务，那怕是进行每一次学习，都十分需要听党的话，听领导的话，争取领导的帮助和支持。党和领导上叫怎样去做，就不折不扣地按党和领导上的指示去做。”他又说：“有些人思想进步慢，工作成绩差，是什么原因造成的呢？我认为，原因只有一个，这就是自以为正确，不靠拢领导，不听从领导，明明自己看法错了也不能改正，明明领导的意见正确也不能诚恳接受。我深深体会到，依靠党才能进步，否则就要落后。”这就是杜凤瑞同志对党的教导采取的态度。有了党的领导，有了他对党的忠诚，因此，他在生活的道路上，才乘风破浪勇猛直前，在陆军中是好战士，在学校是好学员，最后成长为一个伟大的共产主义战士。
    我们成熟的、英明的党，时时刻刻在关怀和教导着我们；劳动人民的优美品质，时时刻刻在影响着我们；伙伴们的英雄模范事迹，不断地在鼓舞着我们；社会主义建设和社会主义的革命运动，在我们面前像波浪一般地展开；旧社会遗留的污毒，纵然还有很大的影响，但它们早已成为被蔑视的不合法的东西：难道这样的环境不是很好的环境吗？难道这样的条件不是很好的客观条件吗？问题是道路虽好，还要我们自己的双脚来走。共产主义思想虽好，也不会自己飞到我们的头脑里扎根。不会有任何一种物理、化学的方法，会一古脑儿地使我们头脑里的个人主义的污垢消失。一句话，主观努力是一个重要问题。我们看杜凤瑞同志，在生活实践中是抱着多么严肃的态度。他在另一篇日记里写道：“每个人从成年以后一直到停止呼吸的时候，几十年的生活，就构成各人自己的历史。至于各人自己的历史画面上所涂的颜色是白的、灰的、粉红的或者是鲜红的，虽然客观因素起一定作用，但主观因素却起决定性的作用。每个人每时每刻都在写自己的历史。每个党员和共青团员都应当好好地想一想，怎样来写自己的历史。每个党员和共青团员时时刻刻都要以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来作自己的思想行动的指导，真正做到言行一致。我要永远保持自己历史的鲜红颜色。”这段话说得多好！真是叫人惊醒，叫人振奋！从这段话里，我们仿佛看到一个伟大的形象，一个头脑异常清醒和坚定的战士迈开大步严肃地走着人生的道路。现在我们可以告慰烈士的英灵说：亲爱的同志，你已经完全实现了你生前的誓言。你的历史，是一页鲜红的历史！你的一生，是红色的一生！它红得像鲜花，红得像烈火，红得像你在祖国的碧空洒下的忠实于党忠实于人民的热血！
    同志们！让我们想一想，我们的历史是涂了些什么样的颜色呢？是鲜红的呢，还是颜色浅淡的粉红的呢？或者是还夹杂着一些白色和灰色的斑点呢？我不知道每个人将怎样来回答这个问题。也许在回忆中，会感到兴奋，也许会感到惭愧。但是沮丧和叹息都无补于事，过去的日子已经像流水般地逝去。只有下定决心，诚诚恳恳，兢兢业业，用自己的赤诚和忠心来书写今后鲜红的篇章。但是，如果不解决一下根本问题，纵然下了决心，那些白色和灰色的斑点，也许还会玷污我们的历史。这个根本问题，就是人生观问题。也就是说，在我们的内心深处，究竟是为个人、为少数人而生活呢？或者是为集体、为大多数人、为我们伟大的人民事业而生活？我们的脑瓜，究竟是让它变做“国营”的好呢？变做“私营”的好呢？或者是弄成一个“公私合营”的小杂货店好呢？同志们！只有我们牢固地树立起共产主义的人生观，生命的航船才算有了正确的方向，纵然有弥漫的云雾，也不会迷失航路。我们的历史也才能写得鲜红。让我们每个红色的革命战士，都用赤胆忠心的大笔来书写鲜红的历史吧！这就是向杜凤瑞烈士学习中应该得到的结论。
