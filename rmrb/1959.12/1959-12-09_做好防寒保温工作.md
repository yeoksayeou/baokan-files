    Do a Good Job in Cold Protection and Warmth Preservation
    In another fourteen days, it will be the winter solstice. Every winter, the severe cold weather brings certain difficulties to production, while production tasks are even heavier than before. We must both complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule and exceed the quota, and also achieve a "good start" in the new year's production. This makes winter the most crucial moment on the production front.
    At this most crucial moment, how can we make the final battle and the opening battle on the production and construction front even more beautiful than the year before? We believe that, in addition to the vigorous spirit and soaring drive of every soldier in every post, all departments must also have appropriate measures for cold protection and warmth preservation. For example, furnaces and pipelines in metallurgy, oil refining, and other industries in cold areas need to increase necessary anti-freeze and heat preservation equipment; concrete projects on basic construction sites need necessary warm sheds and steam; highway transportation lines need to strengthen line maintenance and increase vehicle insulation tarpaulins, etc. All of these require early arrangements and preparations based on the winter production situation. The Greater Khingan Range forest area has built animal-powered and mechanical ice roads in advance to ensure the normal progress of timber collection and transportation when the mountains are blocked by ice and snow; the Tonghua Iron and Steel Plant in Jilin Province has made early preparations for the heat preservation of blast furnaces to ensure that the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces does not decrease; the Sujiatun Station and Locomotive Depot of the Shenyang Railway Bureau have actively made arrangements for winter shunting operations, and in mid-November, when snow was flying, they created a record of shortening the shunting operation time by 0.2 hours compared with the first ten days of the month; employees of the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department improved operating methods in driving, loading, and unloading according to the characteristics of winter transportation, ensuring smooth transportation. It can be seen that making early preparations for cold protection and warmth preservation is an important guarantee for normal production.
    The northern provinces of our country are the earliest regions to enter winter. Before the winter solstice, some places become a world of "thousands of miles of ice, tens of thousands of miles of snow." After the winter solstice, the temperature will become lower and colder. Whether all departments and all links on the industrial production, construction, and transportation fronts can do a good job in cold protection and warmth preservation is directly related to the continued improvement of production. If the temperature of the blast furnace drops, the utilization coefficient will also decrease accordingly; if the oil nozzles in the oil field are waxed, crude oil production will be stopped; if the power machinery or pipelines on the drilling site are frozen, drilling and stuck drilling accidents will occur; if the cold protection and warmth preservation work on the basic construction site is not done well, it will directly affect the progress and quality of the project; if the transportation work cannot keep up, the supply of raw materials to all departments of the entire industrial production will be affected. Therefore, cold protection and warmth preservation work is a major event related to the overall leap forward of all departments of the national economy, and cannot be taken lightly.
    In order to safely survive the winter and ensure the continuous rise of winter production, in addition to ensuring that production equipment must be well protected from the cold and kept warm, the lives of employees must also be properly arranged. For example, prepare enough gloves, rain gear, and other winter construction cold protection supplies for workers working in the open air; repair houses in a timely manner, and do a good job in the supply of winter food, vegetables, and daily necessities, so that workers can eat well, sleep well, and rest well. Machines and equipment are operated by people. Only by doing a good job in the cold protection and wintering of people can we better ensure the normal operation of machines in the cold winter season. The production enthusiasm of employees is improved, accidents and diseases are reduced, the attendance rate is high, and the production efficiency is also high. Of course, in doing a good job in cold protection and warmth preservation, we must pay attention to simplicity and adapt to local conditions, and strive for economy. We must fully mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out technological innovation, and solve the problem of cold protection and wintering equipment through self-reliance. If extravagance and waste are practiced in the cold protection work, it will also be detrimental to production.

### 做好防寒保温工作

    做好防寒保温工作
    再过十四天就是冬至了。每年冬天，严寒的气候给生产带来了一定的困难，而生产任务却比以前更加繁重，既要提前和超额完成今年的生产计划，又要做到新年生产“开门红”，这就使冬季成为了生产战线上最关紧要的时刻。
    在这个最关紧要的时刻里，怎样才能把一年之中生产建设战线上的最后一仗和开头一仗打得更漂亮呢？我们认为，除了每个岗位上的战士要保持蓬勃的朝气和冲天干劲而外，各个部门在防寒保温工作上，也要有妥善的措施。比如，在寒冷地带的冶金、炼油等工业的炉子和管道，需要增加必要的防冻保温设备；基本建设工地的混凝土工程，需要必要的暖棚和蒸气；公路交通线路上需要加强线路的维护和增加车辆的保温帘布等等。这些，都需要根据冬季生产的情况，早作安排，早做准备。大兴安岭林区提早修建了畜力和机械冰道，保证了冰雪封山时木材集运工作的正常进行；吉林通化市钢铁厂及早做好了高炉的保温工作，保证了高炉利用系数不降低；沈阳铁路局苏家屯车站和机务段积极作好了冬季调车作业的安排，在大雪纷飞的11月中旬，创造了调车作业时间比上旬还缩短零点二小时的纪录；鞍钢运输部门职工根据冬季运输特点，在行车、装卸等方面改进操作方法，保证了运输畅通无阻。可见及早作好防寒保温工作，是正常生产的重要保证。
    我国北方各省是最早进入冬季的地区。冬至以前，有些地方就变成“千里冰封，万里雪飘”的世界了。冬至以后，气温将会变得更低，更加寒冷。工业生产，建设和交通运输战线的各个部门的各个环节，能否做好防寒保温工作，直接关系到生产的继续提高。高炉的温度下降，利用系数也就会随之下降；采油场的喷油嘴结蜡，就会造成原油停产；钻井场上的动力机械或管道冻结，就会发生停钻、卡钻事故；基本建设工地的防寒保温工作搞不好，就直接影响到工程的进度和质量；交通运输工作跟不上去，整个工业生产各部门的原材料供应都会受到影响。因此，防寒保温工作是关系到国民经济各个部门全面跃进的大事，不可等闲视之。
    为了安全过冬，确保冬季生产不断上升，除了生产设备必须做好防寒保温工作以外，对职工的生活也必须妥善地安排。比如，给露天作业的工人准备好足够的手套、雨具等冬季施工防寒用品；及时地修补房舍，作好冬季食品、蔬菜及日用品的供应，使工人们吃好、睡好、休息好。机器设备是要人来操纵的。只有作好了人的防寒过冬工作，才能更加保证机器在严冬时节正常运转。职工的生产情绪提高了，事故疾病少了，出勤率高了，生产效率也就高了。当然，在作好防寒保温工作中，一定要注意因陋就简，因地制宜，力求节约。要充分发动群众，大搞技术革新，自力更生地解决防寒过冬设备。如果在防寒工作中铺张浪费，对生产也是不利的。
