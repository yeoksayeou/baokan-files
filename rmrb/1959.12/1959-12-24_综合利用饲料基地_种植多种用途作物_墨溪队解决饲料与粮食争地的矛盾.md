　　Comprehensive Utilization of Feed Bases, Planting Multi-Purpose Crops
    Moxi Team Solves the Contradiction Between Feed and Grain Land

    (Our report) The Moxi Production Team of Bangdong People's Commune in Jinping County, Guizhou Province, which averages 21.8 pigs per household and 2.3 pigs per mu of land, has been making great efforts to comprehensively utilize feed bases, which not only meets the needs of pig feed but also increases the yield of economic crops and grain crops.
    The Moxi Production Team has gone through a period of exploration from solving the problem of pig feed to vigorously developing the comprehensive utilization of feed bases. This production team began to raise a large number of pigs when it established an advanced cooperative in 1956. The first difficulty they encountered at that time was the lack of feed, especially in winter. How to fundamentally solve the problem of pig feed? After they started by collecting wild feed and establishing perennial feed bases, this problem was better solved. However, as the pig raising industry further developed, new problems emerged: feed bases conflicted with grain crop arable land. The team's total cultivated land area was only 773 mu. After setting aside more than 280 mu as feed bases, the area of agricultural cultivation decreased, averaging just over one mu per person. After the establishment of the People's Commune, pig raising greatly developed in the team. Based on the calculation that each pig needs 0.2 mu of feed land, the team needed more than 400 mu of feed land. The contradiction between feed and grain crops competing for land became even more acute. How to solve this contradiction? When Party Branch Secretary Yang Guodong visited the masses, he was greatly inspired when he heard the villagers talk about how they used to grow green hemp, which yielded both hemp fiber and a large number of hemp leaves to fatten pigs. The Party Branch immediately led the villagers in discussions. Everyone ranked various feed crops and agreed that the leaves and vines of green hemp, sweet potatoes, and potatoes were all good feed; these crops themselves were also grain or economic crops. For example, green hemp can grow in spring, summer, and autumn, and can be harvested four times a year. One mu of hemp field can yield 4,800 jin of hemp leaves each time. Harvesting four times a year can yield 19,200 jin. Based on the calculation that each fat pig eats 25 jin per day and 9,000 jin per year, one mu of hemp field can feed more than two fat pigs per year. More importantly, in addition to hemp leaves, each mu of hemp field can generally yield 50 jin of hemp per harvest. Harvesting four times a year can yield 200 jin. At 7 jiao per jin, the annual income is 140 yuan. After this calculation, the villagers and breeders were all elated, believing that the comprehensive utilization of feed bases and the large-scale cultivation of multi-purpose crops was indeed a good method. Wang Zhenghe, director of the Moxi pig farm, said: "In the past, we worried that planting feed would take up farmland, reducing agricultural income; now that we do this, our feed problem is solved, the pigs are fattened, and there is even greater extra income to come. The socialist road is really getting wider and wider!" Since the beginning of this year, the team has planted more than 40 mu of green hemp, more than 100 mu of potatoes, and 510 mu of sweet potatoes (including intercropping in non-feed bases). They have also used the edges of fields to plant a large number of red amaranth, pumpkins, old *dou shao*, banana trees, etc.
    By widely collecting wild feed and comprehensively utilizing feed bases to cultivate multi-purpose crops, the Moxi Production Team has solved the contradiction between establishing feed bases and agricultural production, achieving a double leap forward in pig raising and agricultural production this year. In terms of pig raising, the team produced more than 15.8 million jin of various feeds this year, which not only met the needs of the team's large-scale pig raising, but also provided more than 80,000 jin to support the Shiheng, Gaohe, and Kaifa production teams. By the end of November, the team's pig inventory reached 1,788, of which more than 90% were raised collectively. The team averaged 21.8 pigs per household and 2.3 pigs per mu of land, an increase of nearly 100% compared to the same period last year. In terms of agricultural production, the comprehensive utilization of feed bases and the large-scale cultivation of multi-purpose crops did not affect the area of agricultural planting. On the contrary, the great development of pig raising provided a large amount of organic fertilizer to agriculture, greatly increasing grain production: this year, the team's total grain income increased by 20.2% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, with rice yield reaching 1,020 jin per mu, an increase of 13% compared to last year. The total income from pig raising and agriculture reached 46,894.52 yuan, averaging 571.89 yuan per household, an increase of 66% compared to last year. (Attached chart)

### 综合利用饲料基地  种植多种用途作物  墨溪队解决饲料与粮食争地的矛盾

　　综合利用饲料基地  种植多种用途作物
    墨溪队解决饲料与粮食争地的矛盾
    本报讯　平均每户有猪二十一点八头、每亩地有猪二点三头的贵州锦屏县邦洞人民公社墨溪生产队，大搞猪饲料基地的综合利用，既满足了猪食需要，又增加了经济作物和粮食作物的产量。
    墨溪生产队从解决猪饲料问题到大搞综合利用饲料基地，走过了一段摸索的道路。这个生产队在1956年成立高级社时，开始大量养猪。当时他们遇到的第一个困难，就是饲料不足，尤其是到了冬天困难更大。怎样从根本上解决猪的饲料问题？他们从采集野生饲料和建立常年饲料基地两个方面入手以后，比较好地解决了这个问题。可是，当养猪事业进一步发展以后，新的问题出来了：饲料基地和粮食作物耕地发生矛盾。这个队的田土面积，总共不过七百七十三亩，抽出二百八十多亩作了饲料基地后，农业耕作面积就少了，按人口平均每人才一亩多地。成立人民公社以后，这个队养猪大发展，以每头猪需要两分饲料地计算，全队需要的饲料地达四百多亩。饲料和粮食作物争地的矛盾更加尖锐了。如何解决这个矛盾？党支部书记杨国东同志在深入访问群众时，听到社员谈起了过去有人种青麻，既收了皮麻又得到大量麻叶喂肥猪的事，受到很大的启发。党支部随即领导社员们进行了讨论，大家把各种饲料作物排了一次队，认为青麻、红薯、洋芋等的叶子、藤蔓多，都是好饲料；这些作物本身又是粮食或经济作物。如青麻，春夏秋三季都可以生长，每年可以收割四次，一亩麻地一次可以收得麻叶四千八百斤，一年收四次就可以得到一万九千二百斤。以每头肥猪每天吃食二十五斤、全年吃食九千斤计算，每亩麻地的麻叶一年可以喂肥猪两头多。更重要的是，除了麻叶外，每亩麻地收割一次，一般可以收得麻五十斤，一年割四次，就可以收得二百斤，以每斤七角计算，一年就可以收入一百四十元。这样一算，广大社员和饲养员无不欢欣鼓舞，认为综合利用饲料基地、大种多种用途作物，确是好办法。生产队的墨溪养猪场场长王政和说：“过去我们愁种饲料占用了田土，农业要减少收入；现在这样搞，我们的饲料问题解决了，猪喂肥了，还有更大的额外收入在后边。社会主义的道路真是越走越宽啦！”今年以来，全队共种了青麻四十多亩，洋芋一百多亩，红薯五百一十亩（包括非饲料基地的套种），还利用田边地角种了大量的红米菜、南瓜、老兜苕、芭蕉树等。
    墨溪生产队由于在广泛采集野生饲料的同时，综合利用饲料基地、大种多种用途作物，解决了建立饲料基地与农业生产争地的矛盾，实现了今年的养猪、农业生产双跃进。在养猪方面，今年全队共生产了各种饲料一千五百八十多万斤，不但满足了本队大量养猪的需要，还拿出八万多斤支援了石硬、高车、开发等生产队。到11月底，全队猪的存栏数达到一千七百八十八头，其中集体饲养的占90％以上，全队平均每户有猪二十一点八头，平均每亩地有猪二点三头，比去年同期增加了近一倍。在农业生产方面，由于综合利用饲料基地、大种多种用途作物，并没有影响农业的播种面积。相反的，养猪事业的大发展，给农业提供了大量的有机肥料，使粮食作物大增产：今年全队粮食的总收入比大跃进的1958年增长了20.2％，其中水稻单产达到一千零二十斤，比去年增加13％。养猪和农业两项总收入，共达四万六千八百九十四点五二元，平均每户收入达五百七十一点八九元，比去年增加了66％。（附图表）
