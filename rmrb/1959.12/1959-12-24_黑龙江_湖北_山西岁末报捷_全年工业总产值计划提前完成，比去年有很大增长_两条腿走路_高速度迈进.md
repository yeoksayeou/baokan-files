Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 23rd: Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, all workers and staff on Heilongjiang Province's industrial front have completed this year's province-wide industrial output value plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. As of December 20th, the province's industrial output value exceeded the state plan by 7.1%. The output of fifty-one major products, including steel, pig iron, raw coal, logs, machine tools, cotton fabrics, and cigarettes, all exceeded the plan, and the output of all products increased significantly compared to last year. Among them, raw coal alone increased by 40.5% compared to last year.

This year, Heilongjiang Province's industrial production achieved an all-around leap forward in high yield, high quality, low cost, and safe production. The quality of major products has reached and exceeded the requirements stipulated by the state. The ash content of raw coal from January to October this year was reduced by 0.35% compared to the plan; the qualification rate of pig iron increased month by month, averaging 70% in the first half of the year, and reaching 98.5% in November. The quality of sixty-one products in light industry and the chemical industry reached advanced national levels. Product costs have been greatly reduced, with comparable product costs reduced by 10.67% compared to 1958.

Heilongjiang Province's industrial production continued to leap forward this year, providing a large amount of materials for economic construction across the country. This year, the province's support for power station equipment nationwide increased by 1.6 times compared to last year. These power generation equipments have been equipped in hydroelectric power stations in Xin'anjiang, Zhejiang, Xinfengjiang, Guangdong, Dahuo, Liaoning and many other provinces and cities. Heilongjiang Province’s support for wood to various parts of the country this year increased by nearly half compared to last year; a third of the coal produced in the province also supported the needs of Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei and other provinces, cities and autonomous regions.

The tremendous achievements of Heilongjiang Province's industrial production this year are the result of the continuous anti-Rightist and encouragement of efforts by all workers and staff in the province under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. At the beginning of this year, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee pointed out at the meeting of the first secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees that 1959 was a situation of "high tide after high tide, leap forward and leap forward" following the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In May of this year, the Provincial Party Committee issued instructions on launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all workers and staff in the province launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, which made the production level rise sharply; the total industrial output value increased by 9.89% in August compared with July, 30.5% in September compared with August, and 3.04% in October compared with September. The production upsurge surpassed each other every ten days, and each month was higher than the previous month, breaking the conventional pattern of being loose at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month. In November, the Provincial Party Committee held an on-site industrial conference in Jiamusi to promote the experience of automatic production lines created by factories such as the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, as well as the "production games" experience created by the Jiamusi Textile Factory, pushing the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement to a new high. By December, forty automatic production lines had appeared in the province, which generally increased production efficiency by more than two times and saved more than one-third of the labor force.

People's Daily, Wuhan, 23rd: By the end of November, Hubei Province had overfulfilled the annual industrial output value plan by 2.63%. As of December 15th, the output of forty-one products in the province had completed the state plan, including pig iron, steel, raw coal, cement, metal cutting machine tools, printed and dyed cloth, rubber shoes, etc.

Hubei Province's industrial production this year, following 1958, has achieved high-speed development. The output of metal cutting machine tools and raw coal has increased several times compared to last year; products that could not be produced in the past or produced very little, such as sulfuric acid, chemical fertilizers, high-efficiency pesticide phosphorus preparations, antibiotics, etc., can now be produced or produced in large quantities.

This good situation in Hubei Province's industrial production is a great victory for the Party's General Line and a great victory for the implementation of a complete set of policies for walking on two legs. This year, while the production of large-scale enterprises has flourished, the small blast furnaces and small coal kilns built during the large-scale steelmaking campaign last year have basically developed into "small foreign groups" and have exerted tremendous power. In the province's coal production, the output of 200 small mines produced by semi-native and semi-foreign and native methods accounted for half of the province's coal production this year. These small enterprises are also continuing to carry out technological transformation, and the technical level is constantly improving.

Over the past year, industrial enterprises in Hubei Province have adhered to the policy of strengthening scientific management on the basis of vigorously launching mass movements, and have extensively carried out technological innovation and technological revolution. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of workers, after opposing Right-leaning tendencies and encouraging efforts, were all high-spirited and full of fighting spirit. Enterprise leading cadres went deep into the front line, attacked key problems and solved key problems. Production was higher every ten days and higher every month. After opposing Right-leaning tendencies, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company extensively mobilized the masses and promoted the Anshan Iron and Steel technical performance competition experience and the Daye Iron Mine key problem tackling experience. The production of the ironmaking plant, steelmaking plant, and coking plant was thriving. The entire company completed the total output value plan nine days ahead of schedule. Daye Steel Plant continuously organized five key problem tackling campaigns focusing on smelting, successively breaking through twenty major key problems and adopting one hundred and ninety-one major measures. The entire plant completed the annual steel and steel materials plan ahead of schedule on December 20. Many local industries have also improved their technical level. For example, in Shashi, more than 70% of the factories and enterprises have realized mechanization and semi-mechanization operations, and more than two thousand new varieties have been successfully trial-produced.

At present, the broad masses of workers and staff in the province are seizing the last few days to prepare for a good start in the first quarter of next year, and are striving for a good start next year and fighting for a continuous leap forward.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd: This year, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers and staff on the industrial front of Shanxi Province have deeply carried out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and have achieved tremendous results in the comprehensive leap forward of industrial production with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. As of December 20th, the total industrial output value of the province (including commune industry, excluding management area industry) exceeded the state plan by 8.56%; ninety-six industrial products had completed the annual output plan ahead of schedule, and the output of products such as steel, pig iron, steel materials, and coal all increased compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Up to now, 739 county-run and above enterprises in the province have completed this year's state plan. The main economic and technical indicators of many industrial sectors have also improved this year compared to 1958. For example, the utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces in the metallurgical industry increased from 6.961 tons last year to 7.362 tons, and the qualification rate of steel increased from 92.94% last year to 97.7%. From January to early December, a total of 106 new products were successfully trial-produced in the province.

The reason why Shanxi Province's industrial production front has achieved tremendous achievements this year is mainly because since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, industrial enterprises throughout the province have carried out the struggle against Right-leaning tendencies and conducted education on the Party's General Line for all workers and staff, which has greatly increased the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff, making the production level higher month by month. Taking the total industrial output value as an example, it increased by 15.63% in August compared with July, 29.61% in September compared with August, 0.63% in October compared with September, and 6% in November compared with October. The output of major products also increased month by month. Steel increased by 21.35% in August compared with July, 28.73% in September compared with August, and 13.66% in October compared with September; the output of pig iron, steel materials, and raw coal increased month by month.

The local small-scale enterprises that were established during the Great Leap Forward last year have become an important force on the industrial front in Shanxi Province. The "small native groups" iron smelting plants that were developed last year have transitioned to "small foreign groups" after rectification and technological transformation. There are currently ninety-six such enterprises, and their pig iron production this year accounts for 59.63% of the province's pig iron production. Not only has the output of these small-scale iron smelting enterprises continued to increase, but the cost has also decreased month by month. For example, the pig iron cost of "small foreign groups" iron smelting enterprises in October decreased by 2.3% compared to September, and the quality of pig iron has also greatly improved.

Vigorously launching mass movements centered on technological innovation and technological revolution has powerfully promoted the development of production. This year, the industrial front of the province has continuously carried out socialist labor competitions with the goal of "three highs" (high output, high quality, high efficiency) "one low" (low cost) and "one guarantee" (guarantee safe production). From January to October, industrial production workers and staff in the province put forward more than 770,000 technical innovation proposals, and more than 380,000 have been realized. For example, the top-blown converter steelmaking without stopping the wind and adding materials and the converter steelmaking without baking the furnace created by Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, and the coal loading machine created by Xishan Mining Bureau, have all played a significant role in production.

　　黑龙江  湖北  山西岁末报捷
    全年工业总产值计划提前完成，比去年有很大增长
    两条腿走路　高速度迈进
    新华社哈尔滨23日电　黑龙江省工业战线全体职工，在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，已经提前超额完成今年全省工业总产值计划。到12月20日止，全省工业总产值超过国家计划7.1％。钢、生铁、原煤、原木、机床、棉织品、卷烟等五十一种主要产品产量，都超额完成了计划，各项产品产量都比去年有很大增长。其中，仅原煤一项就比去年增长40.5％。
    黑龙江省今年工业生产实现了高产、优质、低成本和安全生产的全面跃进。主要产品的质量都达到和超过了国家规定的要求，原煤的灰分今年1月到10月份就比计划降低0.35％；生铁合格率逐月上升，上半年平均为70％，到11月份就达到98.5％。轻工业和化学工业有六十一种产品的质量达到了全国先进水平。产品成本大大降低，可比产品成本比1958年降低10.67％。
    黑龙江省今年工业生产继续跃进，为全国各地经济建设提供了大量的物资。今年，这个省支援全国的电站设备比去年增长了一点六倍。这些发电设备已经装备了浙江的新安江、广东的新丰江、辽宁的大伙房等地的水电站，以及许多省市的新建火力发电厂。黑龙江省今年支援全国各地的木材，比去年增加将近一半；全省生产的煤炭也有三分之一支援了辽宁、吉林、河北等省、市、自治区的需要。
    黑龙江省工业生产今年获得这样巨大的成绩，是全省职工在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，不断反右倾、鼓干劲的结果。今年年初，中共黑龙江省委在地、市委第一书记会议上就指出，1959年是继1958年大跃进之后，“高潮又高潮，跃进再跃进”的形势。今年5月，省委又发出了开展增产节约运动的指示。党的八届八中全会以后，全省职工更加轰轰烈烈地展开了以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，使生产水平直线上升；工业总产值8月份比7月份提高9.89％，9月份比8月份提高30.5％，10月份又比9月份提高3.04％。生产高潮一旬超过一旬，一月高过一月，打破了过去月初松、月末紧的常规。11月份省委又在佳木斯召开全省工业现场会议，推广哈尔滨量具刃具厂等工厂创造的生产自动线经验，以及佳木斯纺织厂创造的“生产运动会”经验，把群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的高潮。到12月份，全省已出现了四十条生产自动线，使生产效率一般都提高两倍以上，节约劳动力三分之一以上。
    本报武汉23日电　湖北省到11月底止，已超额2.63％完成今年的工业总产值计划。到12月15日止，全省已有四十一种产品的产量完成了国家计划，其中包括生铁、钢材、原煤、水泥、金属切削机床、印染布、胶鞋等等。
    湖北省今年的工业生产，继1958年之后，又获得了高速度的发展。金属切削机床和原煤的产量比去年成倍地增长；过去不能生产或产量很少的硫酸、化学肥料、高效农药磷制剂、抗菌素等等，现在都能生产或大量生产了。
    湖北省工业生产的这种良好形势，是党的总路线的伟大胜利，是贯彻一整套两条腿走路方针的伟大胜利。今年，在大型企业生产蓬勃发展的同时，去年大办钢铁中建起来的小高炉、小煤窑等，已经基本上发展为“小洋群”，发挥了巨大的威力。在全省的煤炭生产中，如半土半洋和土法生产的二百个小型矿井今年的产量就占全省煤炭产量的一半。这些小型企业还在继续进行技术改造，技术水平在不断提高。
    一年来，湖北省的工业企业，坚持了在大搞群众运动的基础上加强科学管理的方针，广泛地开展技术革新和技术革命。在党的八届八中全会以后，广大职工经过反右倾、鼓干劲，个个都是意气风发，斗志昂扬，企业的领导干部纷纷深入第一线，攻关键、破关键，生产一旬高一旬，一月高一月。武汉钢铁公司在反右倾后，广泛地发动群众，推行了鞍钢的技术表演赛经验和大冶铁矿攻关经验，炼铁厂、炼钢厂、焦化厂的生产蒸蒸日上，全公司提前九天完成了总产值计划。大冶钢厂连续组织以冶炼为重点的五次攻关运动，先后攻破二十个重大关键，采取了一百九十一项主要措施，全厂在12月20日提前超额完成了全年的钢和钢材计划。许多地方工业也都提高了技术水平，如沙市有70％以上的工厂企业实现了机械化和半机械化操作，试制成功两千多种新品种。
    目前，全省的广大职工正抓紧最后几天为明年一季度的开门红作好准备。力争明年开门红，为持续跃进而斗争。
    新华社太原23日电　山西省工业战线上的广大职工，今年在党的领导下，深入开展增产节约运动，获得了工业生产多快好省全面跃进的巨大成果。到12月20日止，全省工业生产总值（包括公社工业，不包括管理区工业）超额8.56％完成了国家计划；有九十六种工业产品提前完成了全年产量计划，钢、生铁、钢材、煤等产品的产量，都比大跃进的1958年增长。到目前为止，全省已有七百三十九个县营以上的企业完成了今年国家计划。许多工业部门的主要经济技术指标，今年比1958年也有提高。如冶金工业的平炉利用系数由去年的六点九六一吨提高到七点三六二吨，钢的合格率由去年的92.94％提高到97.7％。从1月到12月上旬，全省共试制成功一百零六种新产品。
    山西省工业生产战线今年所以取得巨大的成就，主要是由于从党的八届八中全会以来，全省工业企业开展了反右倾斗争，对全体职工进行了党的总路线教育，广大职工干劲倍增，使生产水平一月高过一月。以工业生产总值为例，8月比7月提高15.63％，9月比8月提高29.61％，10月比9月提高0.63％，11月比10月份提高6％。主要产品产量也逐月上升，钢8月比7月提高21.35％，9月比8月提高28.73％，10月比9月提高13.66％；生铁、钢材和原煤产量逐月上升。
    在去年大跃进中办起来的地方小型企业，已经成为山西省工业战线上的一支重要力量。去年发展起来的“小土群”炼铁厂，今年经过整顿和技术改造，已经过渡到“小洋群”。这类企业目前共有九十六个，它们今年所产的生铁，占全省生铁产量的59.63％。这些小型炼铁企业不仅产量不断提高，而且成本逐月下降，如10月份“小洋群”炼铁企业的生铁成本比9月份下降了2.3％，生铁质量也有很大提高。
    大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，有力地促进了生产的发展。今年全省工业战线持续地开展了以“三高”（高产量高质量高效率）“一低”（低成本）“一保证”（保证安全生产）为目标的社会主义劳动竞赛。1至10月份，全省工业生产职工提出的技术革新建议达七十七万多件，已经实现的有三十八万多件。比如太原钢铁公司创造的转炉炼钢不停风加料、转炉不烘炉炼钢，西山矿务局创造的装煤机等重大的技术革新，都在生产上发挥了显著的作用。（附图片）
