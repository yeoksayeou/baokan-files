　　A Good Form of Combining Education with Productive Labor
    Taiyuan Secondary Schools and Factories Establish Fixed Cooperation - Guaranteeing Students' Participation in Productive Labor According to Plan
    There are three forms of cooperation: 1. Large factories establish affiliated factories in schools, with raw materials, machinery, equipment, and technology provided by the factory, and products delivered to the large factory; 2. Large factories assist schools in running their own factories, processing for large factories, with equipment and funds solved by the school; 3. Small factories are merged into schools.
    (Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch) To further implement the Party's education policy, Taiyuan City's secondary schools have been persisting in running factories through factory-school cooperation. Over the past year, they have produced a large number of products needed for national economic construction and people's lives, and students' academic levels have also improved significantly, with their mental outlook completely renewed.
    Currently, thirty ordinary middle schools and secondary vocational schools in Taiyuan City have established sixty-one school factories in cooperation with relevant factories and mines. These include metallurgy, machinery, chemical, automobile repair, and light industry factories. There are often four thousand students working in these factories. These factories actively process products for large industries and produce many products urgently needed by the market, meeting market needs. Most of the light switches, light bulb sockets, and plastic buttons on the Taiyuan market are produced in these school factories.
    The school factories' ability to maintain normal production ensures that students can participate in productive labor regularly according to plan. In production, students apply the knowledge they have learned from textbooks to production practice, deepening their understanding of the text, consolidating their memory, and learning a lot of production knowledge. Taiyuan No. 3, No. 5, and No. 12 Middle Schools have also moved the classroom to the factory for "on-site teaching," making the lectures that students originally found boring in the classroom concrete and vivid, and students can easily understand them. According to a recent teaching quality survey by Taiyuan No. 12 Middle School, the academic performance of 132 third-year junior high school students who participated in factory production has improved significantly compared to before labor. The percentage of students scoring four or more in the three basic courses of mathematics, Chinese, and physics increased from 40% in 1958 to 74.8%.
    Students going to factories for labor regularly, on the one hand, have been tempered by collective production, and on the other hand, have been directly educated by veteran workers. Their ideological awareness has been greatly improved, and labor has brought a new atmosphere of hard work, discipline, love of labor, and concern for the collective to the schools.
    The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has always paid attention to the specific leadership of school-run factories and has continuously criticized various erroneous ideas, which is an important guarantee for the ability of secondary schools to persist in running school factories well. In February of this year, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered that factory-school cooperation was a good way to consolidate and improve school factories, so it promptly summarized and promoted it and included it as one of the contents of the city's major national economic cooperation. In order to enable this form to develop healthily, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China further determined that the school factory's policy should be based on improving teaching quality, so that production serves large industry, agriculture, and people's lives, pointing out that school factories must gradually develop from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, and from simple to perfect; criticized the ideas of some factories being afraid of trouble, some schools seeking perfection and being overly ambitious, and simply relying on factories. In addition to grasping ideological work, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also carried out large-scale organizational work in this work, and successively held two factory-school cooperation meetings, organizing fourteen factories and mines and more than twenty secondary schools to establish fixed cooperative relationships.
    The practice of running factories by schools in Taiyuan City proves that the fixed and regular cooperation and assistance of large factories to schools is a major experience for schools to overcome difficulties and persist in running factories well. At present, there are three forms of school-run factories in Taiyuan City, the most common of which is that large factories go to schools to establish affiliated factories, with raw materials, machinery, equipment, and technology provided by the factory, and products delivered to the large factory; another form is that large factories assist schools in running their own factories, processing for large factories, with equipment and funds solved by the schools themselves. This form is mainly adopted by secondary vocational schools and a few ordinary middle schools with better conditions, and the least used form is to merge small factories of ten or twenty people into schools. The fixed cooperation form of large factories with schools has many advantages. In the past, school-run factories had difficulties in raw materials, equipment, and technology, which were not easy to solve, and sometimes they had to stop work, affecting the original labor plan. After schools and large factories established fixed cooperative relationships, the large factories not only allocated some machines to support the schools, but also dispatched 314 veteran workers and excellent technicians to the schools. In addition to imparting technology, they also regularly conducted labor appraisals for students and told students about their experiences, conducting class education for students. After factory-school cooperation, the products of school factories are also included in the national plan through large factories, making students' labor a part of social labor.
    After factory-school cooperation, school factories are becoming increasingly well-equipped and production is becoming normal, which makes it easier for schools to actively arrange teaching and labor according to different grades and different levels of knowledge, so that students' labor is fully incorporated into the teaching plan.

　　教育与生产劳动相结合的好形式
    太原中等学校和工厂固定协作  保证学生按计划参加生产劳动
    协作形式有三种：一、大工厂在学校建立附属工厂，原料、机器、设备、技术由工厂帮助解决，产品交给大工厂；二、大工厂协助学校自己办工厂，给大工厂加工，设备资金由学校解决；三、小工厂合并到学校里去。
    本报太原讯　太原市各中等学校通过厂校协作，坚持学校办工厂，进一步贯彻了党的教育方针。一年多来，生产了大量国民经济建设和人民生活中所需用的产品，也使学生的学业水平有了显著的提高，学生的精神面貌焕然一新。
    目前，太原市三十个普通中学和中等专业学校，和有关厂矿协作办起来的学校工厂有六十一个。其中有冶炼、机械、化工、汽车修理和轻工业等工厂。经常在这些工厂里劳动的学生有四千名。这些工厂积极为大工业加工产品，生产了很多市场急需的产品，满足了市场的需要。太原市市场上的电灯开关、电灯灯头、塑料钮扣等，大部分是从这些学校工厂里生产出来的。
    学校工厂能坚持正常生产，就保证了学生能按计划定期参加生产劳动。学生在生产中，把课本上学到的知识，运用到生产实践中去，加深了对课文的理解，巩固了记忆，还学到不少生产知识。太原市三中、五中、十二中还把课堂搬到工厂“现场教学”，使原来学生在课堂上感到枯燥的讲课变得具体生动，学生听了很容易理解。据太原市第十二中学最近的一次教学质量调查，初中三年级的一百三十二名参加过工厂生产的学生，学业成绩比劳动前有显著提高。数学、语文、物理三门基础课考试成绩在四分以上的学生，由1958年的40％，上升到74.8％。
    学生定期到工厂劳动，一方面经受了集体生产的锻炼，一方面直接受到了老工人的教育，思想觉悟有了很大提高，劳动给各个学校带来了努力学习、遵守纪律、热爱劳动、关心集体的新风尚。
    中共太原市委一贯注意对学校办工厂的具体领导，和不断批判各种错误思想，是各中等学校能把学校工厂坚持办好的重要保证。今年2月，中共太原市委发现了厂校协作是使学校工厂巩固、提高的好形式，就及时总结和推广，并把它列为全市国民经济大协作的内容之一。为了使这种形式能得到健康的发展，中共太原市委还进一步确定了学校工厂的方针是从提高教学质量出发，使生产服务于大工业、农业和人民生活，指出学校工厂必须通过由小到大、由土到洋、由简陋到完善逐步向前发展的道路；批判了一部分工厂怕麻烦，一部分学校求全求大和单纯依赖工厂的思想。中共太原市委在这一工作中，除了抓紧思想工作外，还进行了大规模的组织工作，曾连续召开两次厂校协作会议，组织了十四个厂矿和二十多个中等学校建立了固定的协作关系。
    太原市学校办工厂的实践证明，大工厂对学校固定的、经常的协作和帮助，是学校能够克服困难，坚持把工厂办好的一条主要经验。目前，太原市学校办工厂的形式有三种，最多的是大工厂到学校里去建立附属工厂，原料、机器、设备、技术，由工厂帮助解决，产品交给大工厂；另一种形式是由大工厂协助，学校自己办厂，给大工厂加工，设备、资金自己解决，采取这种形式的主要是中等专业学校和少数条件较好的普通中学，采用最少的一种形式是把一二十人的小工厂合并到学校里去。大工厂对学校固定协作的形式，好处很多。过去学校自办工厂，原料、设备、技术困难，都不好解决，有时就不得不停工，影响原来的劳动计划。学校和大工厂建立了固定的协作关系以后，各大工厂不仅抽出了一部分机器，支援了学校，而且抽出了三百一十四名老工人和优秀的技术工人到学校里去。他们到学校除了传授技术以外，还定期给学生作劳动鉴定，给学生讲自己的经历，对学生进行阶级教育。厂校协作以后，学校工厂的产品，还通过大工厂纳入了国家计划，使学生劳动成为社会劳动的一部分。
    学校工厂经过厂校协作，装备日益完善，生产走向正常，这就更便于学校主动按照不同年级和不同的知识水平安排教学和劳动，使学生的劳动完全纳入了教学计划。（附图片）
