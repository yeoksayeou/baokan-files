Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 4th -- The Fuzhou Boiler Factory has achieved an all-round leap forward in production this year: high output, excellent quality, many varieties, low cost, and good safety. The factory's total output value plan for this year was overfulfilled by 0.7% on November 15, an increase of 123% over the same period last year. The production of 143 large and small products, including sugar machine parts, boiler accessories, alkali tanks, steelmaking converters, and cupola furnaces, also exceeded the annual plan ahead of schedule. Among them, the main product, the complete set of equipment for three 500-ton sugar mills per day, was delivered 86 days ahead of schedule, and five more boilers were manufactured than originally planned. All of the dozen or so new products manufactured by the factory this year met the design standards, and no defective products have appeared. The quality of other old products has also improved significantly compared to last year. Product costs have been decreasing month by month. From January to mid-November this year, the total cost of the factory's products was reduced by 14.4% compared to the plan. Due to improved labor efficiency, the average output value completed by each worker in the factory this year increased by 157% compared to the same period last year.

The main reason why the Fuzhou Boiler Factory was able to achieve an all-round leap forward this year is that they constantly criticized right-leaning thoughts, established the idea of ​​a multi-fast, good and economical all-round leap forward, and launched a socialist labor competition centered on "high output, high quality, low consumption and safety" among all employees. After the Party Central Committee put forward the great call to oppose the Right, exert greater effort, and launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy in August, the workers' enthusiasm was even more increased. The output value in August increased by 27.6% compared with July, the output value in September increased by 28.4% compared with August, and the output value in October increased by 17.3% compared with September. During the campaign to increase production and practice economy, all the factory employees focused on the key to production and carried out technical innovations and technical revolutions in depth. There were difficulties in the supply of bituminous coal. The workers boldly and successfully promoted the experience of using anthracite coal. After using anthracite coal to replace bituminous coal, they saved 252 tons of bituminous coal in a few months. During the rush to manufacture sugar machines in August and September, all the factory employees concentrated their efforts and carried out technical innovation activities around the key to sugar machine production. When manufacturing the third set of sugar machine parts this year, Wang Wei, a technical innovation expert, worked hard for seventeen days and created a "universal tube expander," which enabled the factory to complete the original workload of 60,000 man-hours with only 30,000 man-hours. The three sets of sugar machines produced by the factory this year have saved a total of 120,000 man-hours. The continuous improvement of labor efficiency and the saving of raw materials have continuously reduced the total cost of the factory's products. The product cost in the third quarter was reduced by 10.2% compared to the plan, and it was reduced by 15% in October.

Combining the vigorous mass movement with strengthening enterprise management, so that economic work becomes more and more meticulous, is an important condition for the factory to achieve an all-round leap forward this year. This year, the factory resolutely implemented the "two participations, one reform and three combinations" system, and established many rules and regulations to adapt to the leap forward in production, such as stipulating that the factory's technical personnel should regularly go deep into the workshops to work and provide on-site guidance to production; workshop directors should divide up the management of each work section to solve the difficulties encountered in production in a timely manner. A series of strict regulations have been made to ensure product quality. From the drawing of blueprints to the entire process of actual production, the entire factory conscientiously implemented the "five nots" (unqualified drawings shall not be constructed, unqualified materials shall not be used, unqualified blanks shall not be processed, unqualified parts shall not be assembled, and unqualified products shall not leave the factory) and "three inspections" (worker self-inspection, group mutual inspection, and factory special inspection) regulations, and were responsible for the quality of all products. In order to implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, the factory leaders reduced non-production expenses of the factory department and workshops by 30% and 25% respectively at the beginning of the year. The factory leaders grasped production with one hand and safety with the other. Production safety committees were established from the factory to the workshops and work sections, and safety inspectors were also set up in the groups to continuously conduct safety education for employees.

    全年各项指标提前实现
    福州锅炉厂全面跃进
    产量高  质量好  品种多 成本低  安全好
    新华社福州4日电　福州锅炉厂今年生产实现了高产、优质、多品种、低成本、安全全面跃进。全厂今年的总产值计划，已在11月15日超额0.7％完成，比去年同期增长123％；全年生产的糖机部件、锅炉配套、碱桶、炼钢转炉、冲天炉等一百四十三项大小产品产量，也分别提前超额完成全年计划，其中主要的产品三套日榨五百吨糖机的配套制造任务提前八十六天交货，锅炉比原计划多制了五台；今年这个厂制造的十几种新产品，全部符合设计标准，没有出现过一件废品，其他老产品的质量比去年也有显著提高；产品成本逐月下降，今年1月至11月中旬，全厂产品总成本比计划降低了14.4％。由于提高了劳动效率，今年全厂每个工人完成的产值，平均比去年同期增长157％。
    福州锅炉厂今年能够取得全面跃进的成就，主要原因是他们不断批判右倾思想，树立了多快好省全面跃进的思想，并在全厂职工中开展了以“高产优质低耗安全”为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛。今年8月，党中央提出反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的伟大号召后，职工们更是干劲倍增。8月份产值比7月份增长27.6％，9月份比8月份增长28.4％，10月份又比9月份增长17.3％。在增产节约运动中，全厂职工围绕生产关键，深入地开展了技术革新和技术革命。烟煤燃料供应有困难，职工们大胆地成功地推广了使用白煤的经验，用白煤代替烟煤后，几个月内就节约了二百五十二吨烟煤。8、9月间突击制造糖机时，全厂职工又集中力量，围绕糖机生产的关键，展开技术革新活动。在制造今年第三套糖机部件时，技术革新能手王媄苦战了十七天，创造出“万能扩管机”，使得全厂原来需要六万个工时的工作量只用三万个工时就完成了。今年以来全厂生产的三套糖机一共节省了十二万个工时。由于劳动效率的不断提高和原料材料的节约，使全厂产品总成本不断降低，第三季度产品成本比计划降低了10.2％，10月份又降低了15％。
    把大搞群众运动和加强企业管理结合起来，使经济工作越作越细致，是这个工厂今年获得全面跃进的重要条件。今年来，全厂坚决贯彻了“两参一改三结合”的制度，建立了许多适应生产跃进的规章制度，如规定厂的技术人员要经常深入车间办公，对生产进行现场巡回指导；车间主任分工管理各工段，及时解决生产中遇到的困难问题。对保证产品质量作出一系列严格的规定。从绘制图纸到实际生产的整个过程，全厂上下都认真贯彻了“五不”（不合格的图纸不施工、不合格的材料不使用、不合格的毛坯不加工、不合格的零件不装配、不合格的产品不出厂）和“三检”（工人自检、小组互检、厂部专检）规定，对各项产品的质量负责到底。为了贯彻执行勤俭办企业的方针，厂的领导方面在年初就把厂部和车间的非生产费用分别削减30％和25％。厂的领导方面一手抓生产，一手抓安全，从工厂到各车间、工段都成立了生产安全委员会，小组也设有安全检查员，不断对职工进行安全教育。
