The year 1959 has been a year of further intensification and deepening of domestic class contradictions in the United States. The class struggle between a handful of monopoly capitalists on one side and the broad working class and laboring people on the other has unfolded extensively and deeply. Even the right-wing leaders of the AFL-CIO, who have always advocated "class peace," now have to admit: "American workers are forced to wage a class war."

Since the beginning of 1959, the struggle of the American working class against the monopoly capitalists has been relentless. The struggle has flourished mainly around three aspects:

(1) Opposition to unemployment. Mass anti-unemployment and anti-hunger demonstrations began in Detroit on January 12, with more than 1,500 unemployed people marching, holding up signs that read: "We demand work, we don't want subsidies!" "It's not our fault that the crisis occurred, why should we suffer?" "Eliminate the deadly system of exploitation!" Subsequently, the United Auto Workers Union proposed that unemployed workers petition Washington in protest. Amid the rising momentum of mass struggles by unemployed workers across the United States, the American Unemployed Workers Conference was held in Washington on April 8. This conference was the largest anti-unemployment demonstration by American workers since the 1929-1933 capitalist world economic crisis. The 10,000 delegates who attended the conference made angry accusations against the disasters brought to the working class by the capitalist system. This conference became the climax of the anti-unemployment struggle of American workers this year.

(2) Demanding higher wages, sickness benefits, and pensions, and shorter working hours without wage cuts. This year is the period for the revision of collective contracts between labor and management in many industrial sectors in the United States, such as the rubber industry (April), the garment manufacturing industry (May), the steel and mining industries (June), the aluminum manufacturing industry (July), the packaging industry (August), the canning industry (September), and the railroads (November). Collective contracts are the fruits of the American workers' long-term struggle, but the monopoly capitalists are trying their best to turn them into tools to bind workers' freedom and force workers to produce more profits for the capitalists within the validity period of the collective contracts. This year's series of strike struggles in the United States, such as: the strike of 13,000 workers at the Pittsburgh Glass Company, which ended in February after starting in November last year; the strike of workers at 665 bakeries in New York in February; the strike of workers at 226 asphalt mines in March; the strike of 59,000 rubber workers in April; the great strike of 500,000 steel workers in mid-July; the strike of 30,000 copper miners in August; and the strike of 100,000 dockworkers on the East Coast in October, were almost all caused by the capitalists' attempts to extend the term of collective contracts, freeze wages, and other benefits. The steel workers' strike was a major struggle of the American working class against monopoly capital this year. This strike was actually a contest of strength between the American working class and the monopoly capitalists.

(3) Defending trade unions and the democratic rights of the working class is also a more prominent aspect of the American workers' struggle this year. On July 17, "The New York Times" nakedly exposed the ferocious face of the steel monopoly capitalists in dealing with the steel workers' strike, saying: "The United Steelworkers of America has too much power or is demanding too much power. Therefore, the company is not so much refusing to increase monetary benefits as it is trying to weaken this power." "The Wall Street Journal" also said: "In the recent strike, far more than wages were at stake. The fundamental reason for the strike is that the steel bosses are determined to regain greater say in the formulation of labor rules." American workers expressed great resentment over the so-called "Labor Reform Act" passed by Congress. On September 7, Labor Day, 105,000 union members in New York City held an eight-hour demonstration march to protest the new anti-labor law passed by Congress.

The main features of the American workers' struggle this year are:

(1) The strikes are long-lasting and the struggle is very fierce. Many strikes have lasted for several months, such as the steel workers' strike, which lasted for nearly four months. This was completely beyond the expectations of the steel monopoly capitalists, and it was also unprecedented in the history of steel workers' struggles. This strike was longer than the strike struggle of 360,000 steel workers in 1919, which lasted for three and a half months; the workers of the Street Railway Company in Massachusetts struck for nearly seven months; the textile workers in North Carolina struck for more than seven months; the workers of the Phillips Petroleum Company in Oklahoma struck for 97 days; and the workers of the West Virginia Paper Company struck for more than four months. During the strike, the workers were seriously threatened by the capitalists' starvation policy, lost their wages, and the monopoly capitalists also played various tricks to create conspiracies and provocations. In addition, the American government openly and blatantly interfered in the strikes (such as the strikes of steel and dock workers), and even resorted to armed suppression (such as the strikes of textile workers in North Carolina and coal miners in Kentucky). But despite the enormous difficulties, the workers showed a spirit of tenacious struggle and heroic unyielding. After arduous struggles, the striking workers won certain gains. In the first half of this year, more than 90 million American workers forced the capitalists to increase welfare benefits and agreed to increase wages by an average of more than eight cents per hour. Although some strikes have not temporarily achieved their intended goals, the workers have expressed their determination not to give up until they reach their goals. For example, steel workers generally stated that if the workers' demands cannot be met within the 80 days of forced resumption of work, they will "shut down the factory" again on January 26 next year.

(2) The unity and mutual support of the working class in the struggle is one of the most important reasons why the strikes can last for a long time. The American Communist Party gave firm support to the workers' just struggle. The American Communist Party and its honorary chairman, Comrade Foster, have issued statements calling on the American working people to unite and fully support the strike struggle of the steel workers. Under the pressure of the workers, the AFL-CIO also passed a resolution to support the steel workers' strike and launched a national worker donation strike fund. When the textile workers in North Carolina went on strike, the National Executive Committee of the Textile Workers Union allocated $100,000 as a fund to support the striking workers, and other industrial unions allocated $75,000. The National Maritime Union sent protests to President Eisenhower, the Governor of North Carolina, and the commander of the National Guard, opposing the use of troops to suppress the workers. During the steel workers' strike, workers in other industries in the United States, such as copper, shipbuilding, and seamen, also launched strikes, creating a situation of mutual response, making the momentum of the strike struggle even more magnificent.

(3) The workers' struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the American ruling group and its reactionary policies. It is precisely because of this that President Eisenhower had to tear off the mask of "democracy and freedom" and use extremely vicious means to suppress the workers' just struggle. The dockworkers' strike caused more than 200 ships to stop sailing, and the American government, fearing that the prolonged strike "would cause devastating damage to the American economy," brazenly interfered in the strike. During the steel workers' strike, the basic steelmaking capacity of the United States decreased by about 87%, and the output value of steel was lost by about 5 billion US dollars. The profits of American monopoly capital and the tax revenue of the government were lost by a total of 3.1 billion US dollars. The US economy fell by about 4% in the third quarter, and some economic sectors were paralyzed as a result. In particular, this strike directly hit the US policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war. Eisenhower had to admit in a statement on the steel workers' strike in October that the US missile program and all other defense plans had been delayed due to the steel workers' strike, and he felt very "annoyed" about this. Eisenhower, fearing the strength of the socialist camp and the peace and democratic forces around the world, sometimes had to release a smokescreen of "peace," but when the steel workers' strike affected the war plans of the American ruling group, he revealed his true colors and invoked the reactionary Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to forcibly force the steel workers to resume work.

The development of class contradictions in the United States this year is not accidental. The monopoly capitalists' offensive against the living and political rights of the working class is more rampant than at any time in the past, and the situation of the working class is further impoverished and politically more disenfranchised. These factors cannot but arouse the due resistance of the working class.

While intensifying the enslavement of the people of the world, the American monopoly capitalists are shifting the consequences of the economic crisis to the American working class to a greater extent than in the past. Automation, quick work systems, and expansion of armaments and war preparation are the three main magic weapons for the ruling class to exploit the American people. In order to maintain the maximum rate of profit, the American ruling class is increasingly extracting profits from the domestic working class. The expansion of the scope of automation in the production process has made long-term mass unemployment one of the most acute problems of American capitalism. Although the cyclical crisis of overproduction in 1957-1958 has passed, the phenomenon of unemployment has not been eliminated. Even according to official statistics, the proportion of unemployment in the labor force has been rising continuously during the several "prosperous" years in the United States after the war: the number of unemployed accounted for 2.9% in 1953, 4.2% in 1956, and is now close to 5%. In addition to the serious unemployment problem, currency devaluation has also become an important tool for capitalists to attack the living standards of the working class. The cost of living in the United States rose to a new high in October. For example, with the price level in 1947-49 as 100, it reached 125.5 in October, which is the sixth peak in the past seven months. Due to the accelerated implementation of the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, exorbitant taxes are even more overwhelming for the American working people. In the year beginning on July 1 this year, the US government's various taxes increased sharply by more than 13 billion yuan, totaling 113 billion yuan. This figure does not include the 13.3 billion yuan of "social security tax." Each taxpayer will bear 63 US dollars more this year than last year, an increase of more than one-tenth. Another important phenomenon reflecting the deepening impoverishment of the American working people is the rapid increase in American private debt. In 1950, Americans owed 21.3 billion US dollars in "consumer credit," but today it has soared to 47.9 billion US dollars. In contrast to the impoverishment of the broad masses of the American people, the profits in the pockets of the monopoly capitalists are growing day by day. In the first half of 1959, the profits of American monopoly capitalists were 48 billion US dollars, which is half more than the same period last year, of which the profits of the textile industry increased by 340% compared with last year, the automobile industry increased by 200%, and the steel industry increased by 153%.

The American monopoly capitalists' offensive against the rights of the working class and trade unions has today reached an almost unparalleled degree of madness. President Eisenhower said in his State of the Union address in January this year in a murderous tone that "inadequate measures will not solve the problem" in order to suppress the American workers' movement. On September 14, he signed the so-called "Labor Reform Act" passed by the joint session of both houses of Congress. This is a new and rampant attack on the workers' movement since the American ruling group formulated the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. This decree stipulates that the government has the right to forcibly supervise the internal financial power of trade unions, the government has the right to control the internal organizational work of trade unions, strictly restricts various means of struggle of trade unions, stipulates that state authorities also have the right to undermine trade unions, and stipulates that enterprises may not hire union members. In addition, as mentioned above, the American ruling group also used a series of high-pressure methods to suppress strikes and force the working class to submit. The reactionary nature of the American ruling group in dealing with the workers' movement has been fully exposed, as the draft political resolution of the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of the United States, which will be held in New York on December 10, says: "The fierce attack launched on trade unions is unprecedented since the Hoover era."

The persecution and sabotage of the American workers' movement by the American reactionaries cannot only not prevent the American working class from moving forward, but also enable the American working class to receive education and training from the opposite side. From this year's personal struggles, the broad masses of American workers have further experienced that: the American capitalist system is not a good system; the so-called "democracy and freedom" in the United States is just a guise for the ruling group to oppress the people; the American state machine is just a tool for the ruling class to implement class oppression on the American working class and people; the monopoly capitalists are the most ferocious enemies of the American working class and people. The American working class's struggle against monopoly capitalism can never be subdued by violence. Looking at next year from this year, the American workers' movement has broader prospects. According to a Kyodo News reporter in New York, even the American bourgeoisie is worried that the American strike movement will flourish next spring: because the steel and dockworkers' "strikes were forcibly ordered to stop, it is very likely that strikes will be held again after the buffer period has passed;... It is believed that the Railway Workers Union (700,000 members) will inevitably start a strike in early February next year. ... If this continues, the US economy will be paralyzed next spring." The American working class, with a tradition of struggle, will never be in a suppressed and disenfranchised position for a long time.

    美国阶级矛盾的发展
    杨重光
    1959年是美国国内阶级矛盾进一步激化和深刻化的一年。以一小撮垄断资产阶级为一方和以广大的工人阶级和劳动人民为另一方的阶级斗争，有了广泛深入的展开。连一向鼓吹“阶级和平”的美国劳联—产联右翼领导者们，现在也不得不承认：“美国工人被迫进行阶级性的战争”。
    1959年年初以来，美国工人阶级反对垄断资产阶级的斗争，真是一波未平，一波又起。斗争主要环绕在三个方面蓬勃开展：
    （一）反对失业。群众性的反失业、反饥饿示威，1月12日在底特律首先开始，一千五百多名失业者举行游行，他们高举着标语牌，上面写着：“我们要求工作，我们不要补助金！”“产生危机并不是我们的过错，为什么我们应该受害？”“消灭致人死命的榨取血汗的制度！”接着，美国联合汽车工人工会提出要求失业工人向华盛顿进行抗议性的请愿。在美国各地失业工人群众性斗争高涨的声势下，4月8日在华盛顿召开了美国失业工人大会。这次大会是1929至1933年资本主义世界经济大危机以来美国工人规模最大的一次反失业大示威。参加大会的一万名代表，对资本主义制度带给工人阶级的灾难，作了愤怒的控诉。这次大会成为今年美国工人反失业斗争的高潮。
    （二）要求提高工资、疾病补助金和养老金，缩短工作时间而不减工资。今年是美国很多工业部门劳资双方改订集体合同的时期，如橡胶工业（4月）、衣服制造工业（5月）、钢铁和采矿工业（6月）、制铝工业（7月）、包装工业（8月）、制罐工业（9月）、铁路（11月）等都须改订合同。集体合同是美国工人经过长期斗争得来的胜利果实，但是垄断资本家却千方百计把它变成为束缚工人的自由、迫使工人在集体合同生效期限内为资本家生产更多利润的工具。今年美国一系列的罢工斗争，如：从去年11月到今年2月结束的匹茨堡玻璃公司一万三千工人的罢工、2月份纽约六百六十五家面包房工人的罢工、3月份二百二十六家沥青矿工人的罢工、4月间五万九千橡胶工人的罢工、7月中五十万钢铁工人的大罢工、8月份三万铜矿工人的罢工、10月份东海岸十万码头工人的罢工等，几乎都是由于资方企图延长集体合同期限、冻结工资和其他福利所引起的。钢铁工人大罢工，是今年美国工人阶级反对垄断资本的一场主要斗争，这次罢工实际上是美国工人阶级和垄断资产阶级力量的一次较量。
    （三）保卫工会和工人阶级民主权利，也是今年美国工人斗争中比较突出的内容。7月17日“纽约时报”就赤裸裸地暴露了钢铁垄断资本家对待钢铁工人罢工的狰狞面目，说：“美国钢铁工人工会权力太大了或是要求的权力太大了。因此，与其说公司拒绝增加金钱方面的福利，还不如说是要削弱这种权力。”“华尔街日报”也说：“在最近的罢工中，发生争执的远不止工资问题。罢工的根本原因是钢铁业老板们决心要在制定劳动规则时重新获得更大的发言权。”美国工人对于国会通过的所谓“劳工改革法”，更是表示极大愤恨。9月7日美国劳工节，纽约市有十万五千工会会员举行了长达八小时的示威游行，反对国会通过新的反劳工法。
    今年美国工人的斗争的主要特点是：
    （1）罢工时间持久，斗争十分激烈。很多罢工都长达好几个月，如：钢铁工人罢工接近四个月，这完全出于钢铁垄断资本家的意料之外，也是钢铁工人斗争史上所没有的，这次罢工比1919年三十六万钢铁工人坚持三个半月的罢工斗争时间还要长；马萨诸塞州斯特里特铁路公司工人罢工了将近七个月；北卡罗来纳州纺织工人罢工了七个月以上；俄克拉荷马州菲立普石油公司工人罢工了九十七天；西弗吉尼亚造纸公司工人罢工了四个多月。工人们在罢工期间，受到资方饥饿政策的严重威胁，丧失了工资，垄断资本家并玩弄各种手段进行阴谋挑拨，加上美国政府明目张胆地对罢工进行粗暴干涉
  （如对钢铁、码头工人罢工），甚至采取武装镇压（如对北卡罗来纳州的纺织工人和肯塔基州的煤矿工人罢工）。但尽管困难是巨大的，工人们却表现了顽强战斗、英勇不屈的精神。经过艰苦的斗争，罢工工人赢得了一定的成果。今年上半年有九千多万美国工人迫使资方增加了福利费，并答应了每小时平均增加工资八分多钱。有些罢工虽然暂时没有达到预期的目的，但是工人们已表示不达目的，誓不罢休。如钢铁工人就普遍表示：如在被迫复工的八十天内不能满足工人的要求，他们将于明年1月26日，再度“使工厂关门”。
    （2）工人阶级在斗争中团结一致，并且相互支援，这是罢工能够长期坚持的一个最重要的原因。美国共产党对工人们的正义斗争作了坚定的支持。美共和它的名誉主席福斯特同志都曾发表声明，号召美国劳动人民团结一致，全力支持钢铁工人的罢工斗争。劳联—产联出于工人群众的压力，也通过决议支持钢铁工人罢工，并发动全国工人捐献罢工基金。当北卡罗来纳州纺织工人罢工时，纺织工会全国执行委员会拨了十万美元作为支援罢工工人的基金，其他产业工会拨了七万五千美元。全国海员工会向艾森豪威尔总统、北卡罗来纳州州长和国民卫队司令发出了抗议，反对利用军队镇压工人。在钢铁工人罢工时，美国其他行业如铜业、造船、海员等工人也发动了罢工，造成相互呼应的局面，使罢工斗争的声势更加壮阔。
    （三）工人的斗争给予美国统治集团和它的反动透顶的政策以沉重的打击，正因如此艾森豪威尔总统才不得不撕下“民主自由”的假面具，用穷凶极恶的手段镇压工人的正义斗争。码头工人的罢工使二百多艘船只停驶，美国政府怕罢工持久“将使美国经济遭受毁灭性的打击”而悍然干涉罢工。钢铁工人的罢工期间，美国的基本炼钢能力减少约87％，钢的产值损失五十亿美元左右，美国垄断资本的利润和政府的税收一共损失三十一亿美元。美国第三季度的经济因此而下降约4％，某些经济部门因而陷于瘫痪。特别是这次罢工直接打击了美国的扩军备战政策，艾森豪威尔在10月就钢铁工人罢工发表的声明中不得不承认：美国的导弹计划和其他一切国防计划都因钢铁工人的罢工而受到耽搁，他对此感到非常“恼火”。艾森豪威尔慑于社会主义阵营和全世界和平民主力量的壮大，有时不得不施放“和平”的烟幕，但是当钢铁工人的罢工影响美国统治集团的战争计划时，他就原形毕露，援用反动的塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法，强制迫使钢铁工人复工。
    今年美国阶级矛盾的发展不是偶然的。垄断资产阶级对工人阶级生活权利和政治权利的进攻，比过去任何时期都更加猖狂，工人阶级的处境进一步贫困化，在政治上更加处于无权的地位，这些因素不能不激起工人阶级应有的反抗。
    美国垄断资产阶级在加紧奴役全世界人民的同时，比过去在更大程度上把经济危机的后果转嫁到美国工人阶级身上。自动化、赶快制度和扩军备战是统治阶级榨取美国人民的三个主要法宝，美国统治阶级为了维持最大限度的利润率，就日甚一日从国内工人阶级身上榨取利润。生产过程自动化范围的扩大，使长期的大量失业成为美国资本主义最尖锐的问题之一。1957—1958年生产过剩的周期性危机尽管已经过去，但是失业现象并未消除。在战后美国几个“繁荣”的年代里，即使根据官方统计，失业在劳动人口中的比重也是不断上升的：1953年失业人数占2.9％，1956年占4.2％，而现在是接近5％。除了严重的失业问题外，货币贬值也成为资本家进攻工人阶级生活水平的重要工具。美国的生活费用到10月份上升到新的高峰，如以1947—49年的价格水平为一百，10月份达一百二十五点五，这是过去七个月中第六个高峰。由于扩军备战政策的加速推行，苛捐杂税更是压得美国劳动人民抬不起头来，在今年7月1日开始的年度中，美国政府的各种税收猛增一百三十多亿元，总数达到一千一百三十亿元，这个数字还不包括一百三十三亿元的“社会保险税”。每一个纳税人今年要比去年多负担六十三美元，即增加十分之一以上。反映美国劳动人民贫困化日益加深的另一个重要现象是，美国私人债务迅速增加，1950年美国人在“消费者信贷”方面欠下二百一十三亿美元，今天却猛增到四百七十九亿美元。同美国广大人民贫困化相对照的是，垄断资本家的钱囊里利润正在日涨夜大。1959年上半年美国垄断资本家的利润为四百八十亿美元，这比去年同期增加一半，其中纺织业的利润比去年增加340％，汽车业增加200％，钢铁业增加153％。
    美国垄断资产阶级对工人阶级和工会权利的进攻，今天几乎达到无以复加的疯狂的程度。艾森豪威尔总统在今年1月的国情咨文中就杀气腾腾地说，为了镇压美国工人运动，“不彻底的措施是解决不了问题的”。9月14日他签署了由国会两院联席会议上通过的所谓“劳工改革法”。这是1947年美国统治集团制定塔夫脱—哈特莱法以来对工人运动一次新的猖狂的进攻。这个法令规定：政府有权对工会内部的财政权加以强制监督，政府有权控制工会内部的组织工作，对工会的各种斗争手段加以严格限制，规定州当局也有权破坏工会，规定企业可以不雇佣工会会员等。此外，如上所述，美国统治集团还用一系列高压手段，镇压罢工，逼使工人阶级就范。在对待工人运动上，美国统治集团的反动性已经暴露无遗了，正如12月10日将在纽约举行的美国共产党第十七次代表大会政治决议草案所说：“对工会展开的猛烈进攻，是胡佛时代以来所未有过的。”
    美国反动派对美国工人运动的迫害和破坏，不仅不能阻止美国工人阶级的前进，反而使美国工人阶级可以从反面受到教育和锻炼。美国广大工人群众从今年亲身斗争中进一步体验到：美国资本主义制度并不是好制度；美国的所谓“民主自由”不过是统治集团欺压人民的一个幌子；美国的国家机器不过是统治阶级对美国工人阶级和人民实行阶级压迫的工具；垄断资产阶级是美国工人阶级和人民最凶恶的敌人。美国工人阶级反对垄断资本主义的斗争决不是暴力可以压服的。从今年看明年，美国工人运动有着更加广阔的前景，据共同社纽约记者报道，连美国资产阶级都担心明春美国罢工运动将蓬勃展开：由于钢铁、码头“罢工是被强制命令停止的，很有可能在缓冲期间过去以后再次举行罢工；……人们认为铁路工会（七十万会员）明年2月初必然会开始罢工。……这样下去，美国经济将会在明年春天陷于瘫痪状态。”具有斗争传统的美国工人阶级，他们决不会长期处于被压制和无权的地位。（附图片）
    失业者从美国各地乘火车云集到华盛顿，参加四月八日的失业工人大会，抗议当局的制造失业的政策，要求把对外“援助”的款项用来改善退休老工人的境遇和增加工资、缩短工作时间和扩大就业。
