    Milk Tree
    In the Amazon region of South America, there is a tree that local residents call the "Milk Tree." As soon as the trunk is slightly cut with a knife, a thick white liquid immediately flows out. The taste of this liquid is very similar to milk. However, because its aftertaste is a bit bitter, it is considered poisonous and not used as food.

    Botanists have done a chemical analysis of this liquid, and according to its chemical composition, it is definitely suitable to be used as milk. If the liquid is diluted with water, boiled, and the bitter taste is removed, it will become a beneficial food. Each tree can yield two to four liters of milk per "milking."

    奶头树
    南美亚马逊河流域有一种树，当地居民叫它为“奶头树”。只要用刀子稍微割开树干，立刻流出一股浓稠的白色浆液。这种浆液的味道非常像牛奶。不过，因为它的余味有点苦，被人们认为有毒而不当作食物。
    植物学家把这种浆液作了化学分析，照它的化学成份来说，确定很可以当作牛奶。要是掺水冲稀浆液，用火煮沸，去掉苦味，则将成为一种有益的食物。每棵树“挤一次奶”可得二到四公升乳汁。
