Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 11th: Abdul Rahman Mohamed, Secretary-General of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, who is currently visiting Cairo, stated in a statement today that if the people of Zanzibar are not given freedom by 1960, they will take active action to oppose British rule. This decision was made at a mass rally attended by ten thousand people in Zanzibar on December 6.

Abdul Rahman Mohamed said that the British colonial authorities have taken repressive measures to deal with the decision made at the mass rally. Immediately after the rally, it arrested fourteen Zanzibar nationalists, including the wife of Zanzibar Nationalist Party leader Ali Mohsin. The British colonial authorities arrested them on the absurd "charge" of "wearing clothes of their own choosing."

He said that the people of Zanzibar will never yield until they gain freedom.

The Isle of Cloves

Zanzibar is the world-renowned "Isle of Cloves," producing over nine million kilograms of cloves annually, accounting for 80% of the world's total production. This historically rich Muslim sultanate, located in the Indian Ocean off East Africa, was once a powerful nation on the East African coast during the Middle Ages. However, it was invaded by Portuguese colonialists in the early 16th century. In 1890, Britain and Germany concluded a treaty on the division of East Africa, declaring Zanzibar a British "protectorate."

The 300,000 people of Zanzibar cannot tolerate their beautiful and fragrant land being trampled on by colonialists for a long time and have waged a long struggle. In 1955, the people of Zanzibar held demonstrations and boycott movements to protest the British appointment of members to the Legislative Council. At the end of 1957, representatives of the people of Zanzibar denounced British oppression at the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. Earlier this year, 75,000 people participated in the struggle against the colonial education bill. (Jin)

    桑给巴尔人民决不屈服
    万人集会要求明年获得自由
    据新华社开罗11日电　正在开罗访问的桑给巴尔国民党总书记阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·穆罕默德在今天发表的一项声明中说，假如到1960年还不给桑给巴尔人民自由的话，他们就将采取积极行动来反对英国的统治。这个决定是12月6日在桑给巴尔举行的有一万人参加的群众大会上作出的。
    阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·穆罕默德说，英国殖民当局采取镇压措施来对付在群众大会上作出的这项决定。在这次群众大会举行以后，它立即逮捕了十四名桑给巴尔民族主义者，其中包括桑给巴尔国民党领袖阿里·莫辛的妻子在内。英国殖民当局是以“穿着自己选择的服装”这样荒谬的“罪名”逮捕他们的。
    他说，桑给巴尔人民决不屈服，直到获得自由为止。
    丁香之岛
    桑给巴尔是世界闻名的“丁香之岛”，年产丁香九百多万公斤，占世界总产量的80％。这个位于东非印度洋上的一个历史悠久的穆斯林酋长国，在中世纪时曾是东非海岸的一个强国。但是，十六世纪初受到葡萄牙殖民者的侵入，1890年英国同德国订立关于东非的分脏条约，把桑给巴尔宣布为英国的“保护国”。
    三十万桑给巴尔人民不能容忍他们的美丽芳香的国土长期受殖民主义者践踏，进行了长期斗争。1955年，桑给巴尔人民举行示威和抵制运动，抗议英国任命立法会议的成员，1957年底桑给巴尔人民代表在亚非人民团结大会上控诉英国的压迫。今年初，七万五千人参加了反对殖民教育法案的斗争。　（金）
