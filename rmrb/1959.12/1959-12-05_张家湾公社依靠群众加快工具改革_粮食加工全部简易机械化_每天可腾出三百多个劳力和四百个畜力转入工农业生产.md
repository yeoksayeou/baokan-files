    Zhangjiawan Commune Relies on the Masses to Accelerate Tool Reform
    Grain Processing Entirely Simple Mechanization
    More Than 300 Laborers and 400 Animal Power Can Be Freed Daily to Transfer to Industry and Agriculture Production
    (By Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that the grain processing work of more than 43,000 people in the Zhangjiawan People's Commune in Tongzhou District, Beijing, has been entirely mechanized using relatively simple methods. More than 369 laborers and 400 animal power can be saved every day.
    In the past, the grain processing of this commune relied entirely on human and animal power. Among the more than 8,500 male and female laborers and more than 1,900 livestock in the entire commune, an average of one person out of every 21 people pushed a mill, and one animal out of every five livestock pulled a mill. Four hundred people and four hundred livestock were engaged in grain processing every day. After mechanization, only 31 management personnel are needed. The entire commune can save more than 134,000 man-days and more than 146,000 animal-days a year, which is equivalent to increasing the commune's labor force by 5% and its animal power by 20%.
    In the technical innovation movement to realize the mechanization of grain processing, this commune extracted several technicians from the commune-run iron factory, farm tool factory, and carpentry factory to form a technical research team, went out to visit and study, and studied the transformation of grain processing tools, while mobilizing commune members to carry out technical innovations on a large scale. After repeated experiments, the technical research team transformed the old stone mills into powered flat mills, and the commune members also dug pits, made cement, built bricks, and installed electrical equipment by themselves, and transformed the manual stone rollers into powered stone rollers.
    The raw materials for reforming these tools were all solved by mobilizing commune members to tap potential. In the transformation of six old stone mills into powered flat mills, each one needed 50 jin of copper to make copper tiles. The commune members took out broken copper utensils to melt and use. The commune-run factory also used waste copper powder to re-melt into copper, and used waste wood and iron materials to make various parts. The powered flat mills for processing the main grains of corn and wheat were all successfully transformed in this way. Together with the three powered steel mills purchased that were suitable for processing rice and sorghum, and some small steel mills that were set up shortly after the establishment of the commune, the entire commune now has six flat mills, one stone roller, three steel mills, and 22 small steel mills. Because there is electricity after the communization, and the power supply is convenient, these mills and rollers are all driven by electricity. According to the technicians of the grain processing mechanization technical research team of this commune, in the absence of electricity, boiler engines, gas generators, etc. can be used to drive them. In mountainous areas and places with fast-flowing channels, water power can also be used to drive them. These powered mills and rollers currently process an average of more than 45,000 jin of grain in actual production, which fully meets the needs of all commune members to eat rice and noodles. The total investment in this technical transformation work was only 20,000 yuan, and the manpower and animal power saved can recover it all in one month.
    When carrying out the mechanization of grain processing, this commune made reasonable arrangements for various mills and rollers according to their production capacity, the size of the management area, the number of people, and the distance of the villages. Generally, one management area is set up with one point, which is set up in a village with a central address and convenient transportation. For management areas with large areas and scattered villages, several points are set up to facilitate production and convenience the masses. Each processing point adopts a graded management and separate accounting, enterprise management method. Management personnel are given work points by the production team or management area. The processing fee is reasonably calculated according to the cost to remain self-sufficient. Each processing point has a dedicated person in charge of management, and many of them are women. For example, next to the newly made powered flat mill, only one woman can easily add materials, and the milled flour can be automatically screened in a wooden cabinet, which saves labor and is clean and hygienic. Due to the implementation of a dedicated person responsibility system, the responsibility of the management personnel has been strengthened, their technical level has been continuously improved, and the maintenance of the machines has been strengthened.
    Now, the labor and animal power saved by the entire commune have been transferred to agriculture, industry, sideline occupations, and transportation work respectively.
    The competent departments of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee recently held an on-site meeting in this commune to promote their experience to the people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing, and called on all people's communes in the suburbs with the conditions to take immediate action and take effective measures to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of grain processing.

### 张家湾公社依靠群众加快工具改革  粮食加工全部简易机械化  每天可腾出三百多个劳力和四百个畜力转入工农业生产

    张家湾公社依靠群众加快工具改革
    粮食加工全部简易机械化
    每天可腾出三百多个劳力和四百个畜力转入工农业生产
    本报讯　北京市通州区张家湾人民公社四万三千多人的粮食加工工作，已用比较简易的办法全部实现了机械化，每天可以节省出三百六十九个劳动力和四百个畜力。
    过去，这个公社的粮食加工全靠人力和畜力进行，在全社八千五百多个男女劳动力和一千九百多头牲畜中，平均每二十一人有一人推磨，每五头牲畜有一头牲畜拉磨，每天有四百人和四百头牲畜从事粮食加工工作。实现机械化后，只需要三十一个管理人员就行了。全社一年可以因此节省人工十三万四千多个，畜工十四万六千多个，等于给公社增加了5％的劳动力和20％的畜力。
    这个公社在实现粮食加工机械化的技术革新运动中，从社办铁工厂、农具厂和木造厂抽出几个技术人员，组成技术研究小组，出外参观学习，研究改造粮食加工工具，同时发动社员大搞技术革新。经过反复试验，技术研究小组把旧石磨改造成动力平磨，社员们也自己动手挖坑子、打洋灰、砌砖和安装电力设备，把人工石碾改制成动力石碾。
    改制这些工具的原材料，都是发动社员挖潜力解决的。在利用六台旧石磨改制动力平磨中，每台需要五十斤铜做铜瓦，社员就把破旧铜器拿出来熔化使用，社办工厂也利用废铜末重新化成铜，并且利用废旧的木料和铁料，制成各种部件。加工主要粮食玉米和小麦的动力平磨，就这样全部改制成功了。连同买来的三台适宜于加工稻谷、高粱的动力钢磨，以及公社成立后不久就搞起来的一些小钢磨，现在全社已拥有六台平磨、一台石碾、三台钢磨和二十二台小钢磨。由于公社化后有了电力，电源方便，因此这些磨、碾都是用电力带动。据这个公社粮食加工机械化技术研究小组的技术人员说，在没有电力的情况下，锅驼机、煤气机等都可以带动。在山区和有流量较急的渠道的地方还可以用水力带动。这些动力磨、碾目前平均实际加工粮食达四万五千多斤，充分满足了全体社员吃米吃面的需要。这项技术改造工作所花的投资，总共只两万元，节省出的人力和畜力一个月就能把它全部收回。
    在搞粮食加工机械化时，这个公社根据各种磨、碾的生产能力和所属管理区的范围大小、人口多少、村庄远近等情况，对各种磨、碾作了合理布点。一般是一个管理区设一个点，设在地址适中、交通便利的村庄。面积大、村庄分散的管理区，为便利生产和便利群众，就设立几个点。各加工点都采取分级管理、单独核算，企业经营方式。管理人员由生产队或管理区记工分。加工费按成本合理计算，保持自给自足。各加工点都有专人负责管理，其中有不少是妇女担任这一工作。例如在新制成的动力平磨旁边，只要一个妇女就能轻松地加料了，磨出来的面还能自动筛在一个木柜里，既省力又干净卫生。由于采取专人负责制，加强了管理人员的责任心，不断地提高了他们的技术水平，加强了机器的保养维护。
    现在，全社节省下来的劳动力和畜力，已分别转到农业、工业、副业和运输工作上去了。
    中共北京市委和市人民委员会的主管部门最近在这个公社召开了现场会议，向北京市郊区各人民公社推广了他们的经验，号召全郊区一切有条件的人民公社，立即行动起来，采取有效措施，实现粮食加工的机械化和半机械化。（附图片）
