Glass Harder Than Steel

　　Nanjing Glass Factory has recently successfully trial-produced and started small-scale production of a new product - crystalline glass. Its hardness is greater than that of quenched high-carbon steel, and it can withstand high heat, with a softening point above 1,000 degrees Celsius.

　　This type of glass has a large thermal conductivity and a small expansion coefficient. Therefore, it has good thermal stability, and will not undergo any changes or cracking even with rapid heating and cooling.

　　This type of glass can be used to manufacture special mechanical parts, as well as cutting tools and bearing parts.

    玻璃比钢硬
    南京玻璃厂最近试制成功并开始小批生产一种新产品——结晶玻璃，它的硬度比淬过火的高碳钢的硬度还大，能耐高热，软化点在摄氏一千度以上。
    这种玻璃导热系数大、膨胀系数小，因此，热稳定性很好，即使急冷急热也不会发生任何变化和破裂。
    这种玻璃可以用来制造特殊机械部件，也可以制造切削工具和轴承零件。
