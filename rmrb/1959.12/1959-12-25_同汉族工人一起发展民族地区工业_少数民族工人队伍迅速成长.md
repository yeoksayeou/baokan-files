Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: Under the cordial concern of the Party and the state, the ranks of the minority nationality working class have grown rapidly and become stronger. The number of minority workers has increased from more than 40,000 in 1949 to more than 800,000 now. Together with the Han workers, they are actively developing industry in the minority regions and are a new force in building the country's socialist industry.

The young first generation of minority workers have grown rapidly in recent years. Especially during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, hundreds of thousands of minority farmers and herdsmen joined the ranks of the working class, and the total number of minority workers more than doubled compared to 1957. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 200,000 minority workers in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has more than 170,000 minority workers. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the number of minority workers reached more than 59,000 in 1958. The number of minority workers in Liaoning Province has increased more than six times since 1949, reaching more than 110,000. In Guizhou, there are more than 130,000 workers from the Miao, Buyi, and Dong ethnic groups, accounting for about 14% of the province's total number of workers. In the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the number of Hui workers alone has increased from 79 in 1949 to more than 20,000. After gaining liberation, many serfs and slaves in Tibet have continuously entered industrial, mining, and transportation departments, becoming a vital force in developing Tibetan industry. Now, some minority groups that previously had no workers at all have a considerable number of industrial workers. Ethnic groups such as the Oroqen, Kazakh, Lisu, and Kawa, who used to engage solely in hunting, nomadic herding, or lived semi-primitive lives, have also formed their own worker ranks. Many minority groups that originally only had handicraft workshops are now training their own people in modern factories and mines such as iron and steel, petroleum, and machinery. This change is an important sign that the minority groups with previously lower levels of development are gradually moving towards modern nations.

Party organizations in various regions attach great importance to the training of minority workers. Before building factories and mines, many minority areas have established various professional training courses and selected outstanding minority youth to study technology in factories and mines in the interior. Many factories and mines also regularly hold forums for minority workers, and leading cadres go deep into construction sites, workshops, and dormitories to talk and visit, understand the needs and difficulties of minority workers in production and life, and provide assistance. A large number of Han workers follow the instructions of the Party to conscientiously take on apprentices and teach all their skills to their minority brothers. In just over a year, steel plants in Anshan, Chongqing, Daye, and Ma'anshan have trained 660 workshop directors, foremen, and technicians for the Duyun Iron and Steel Plant in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. Minority new workers sent to Sichuan by the autonomous prefecture's ramie mill to study, can each watch twelve cloth looms after returning to the factory, and some can watch twenty-four.

In the wave of technological innovation, many red banner bearers and advanced collectives have emerged in the ranks of minority workers. The workers in Ningxia are spreading the heroic deeds of the Hui youth worker Ma Yuan in manufacturing electric motors. Ma Yuan saw that the Wuzhong Machinery and Agricultural Implement Repair Factory was seriously affected by the lack of motors, so he wanted to manufacture motors himself. With the support and help of the Party, he worked hard for twenty-eight consecutive days and finally trial-produced a three-horsepower motor using iron sheets instead of silicon steel sheets, and produced forty-five motors in less than a year. The twenty workers of various ethnic groups in the ethnic youth team's drilling machine of the Hydrological Team of the Xinjiang Geological Bureau, each contributed ideas and suggestions, and jointly created a high record of 2,100 meters of hydrological drilling per month. Because they improved their work efficiency, they are already doing the work for August 1960.

　　同汉族工人一起发展民族地区工业
    少数民族工人队伍迅速成长
    据新华社24日讯　在党和国家的亲切关怀下，少数民族工人阶级的队伍迅速成长壮大。少数民族工人已由1949年的四万多人增加到现在的八十多万人，他们和汉族工人一起，积极发展民族地区的工业，是建设祖国社会主义工业的新生力量。
    年轻的少数民族第一代工人，在近几年里成长很快。特别是在大跃进的1958年，几十万少数民族农牧民走进了工人阶级的行列，少数民族工人的总数比1957年猛增一倍以上。根据不完全统计，目前广西僮族自治区的少数民族职工已达二十万人。新疆维吾尔自治区有十七万多名少数民族职工。内蒙古自治区少数民族职工在1958年即达五万九千多人。辽宁省少数民族职工比1949年增长六倍多，已有十一万多人。贵州的苗、布依、侗等族工人，有十三万多人，约占全省工人总数的14％。在宁夏回族自治区，仅回族职工就从1949年的七十九人增加到两万多人。西藏有很多的农奴、奴隶在得到翻身以后，不断进入工矿和交通部门，成为发展西藏工业的生力军。现在，一些过去根本没有工人的少数民族，都有了相当数量的产业工人；以前光是单一经营狩猎、游牧或者过着半原始生活的鄂伦春、哈萨克、傈僳、佧佤等民族，也组成了本民族的工人队伍；许多原来只有手工作坊的少数民族，已经在钢铁、石油、机械等现代厂矿中培养自己的子弟。这种变化，是原来发展水平较低的少数民族逐步走向现代民族的一个重要标志。
    各地党组织十分重视培养少数民族工人的工作，有不少民族地区在建厂建矿以前，就开办了各种专业训练班，并挑选优秀的少数民族子弟到内地厂矿学习技术。许多厂矿还经常召开少数民族工人座谈会，领导干部深入工地、车间、宿舍谈心访问，了解少数民族工人在生产和生活中的要求和困难，进行帮助。大批汉族工人按照党的指示认真带徒弟，把自己的全部技术都教给少数民族兄弟。仅一年多的时间内，鞍钢、重钢和大冶、马鞍山等地钢铁厂就为黔南布依族苗族自治州的都匀钢铁厂培养出车间主任、工长、技术工人六百六十名。自治州麻纺厂派到四川学习的少数民族新工人，回厂后每人能看十二台布机，有的能看二十四台。
    在技术革新的浪潮里，少数民族工人行列中涌现出很多的红旗手和先进集体。宁夏的工人们，传颂着回族青年工人马元制造电动机的英雄事迹。马元看到吴忠机械农具修造厂因缺马达严重影响生产，便想自己动手制造马达。在党的支持帮助下，他一连苦战二十八天，终于用铁皮代替矽钢片试制成了一台三马力电动机，不到一年就生产出电动机四十五部。新疆地质局水文大队民族青年号钻机的二十名各族工人，个个献计献策，共同创造台钻月进尺二千一百米的水文钻探高纪录。由于他们提高了工作效率，现在已经在做1960年8月份的工作。
