　　——Experiences in Improving Mechanical Irrigation Efficiency in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang

    Since the establishment of the communes, agricultural mechanical irrigation in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang, has developed by leaps and bounds. The average irrigation capacity of water pumps in the county has reached 166 mu per horsepower, an increase of more than nine times compared to the pre-liberation level of 16 mu per horsepower, and an increase of 61% compared to last year's 103 mu per horsepower. It is also more than 60% higher than the average of over 90 mu per horsepower in Zhejiang Province, becoming the highest record of mechanical irrigation efficiency over a large area in the province. Due to the improved efficiency of mechanical irrigation, the irrigated area in the county this year has expanded by 460,000 mu compared to 1958. To date, the mechanical irrigation area in Jiaxing County has reached 1.23 million mu, accounting for 87.3% of the total paddy field area in the county, basically achieving the mechanization of agricultural irrigation.
    In the past year, Jiaxing County's main experiences in improving the utilization rate of water pumps are as follows:
    First, the Party Committee has strengthened its leadership over this work. The Jiaxing County Party Committee has a secretary specifically in charge of agricultural mechanical irrigation, and the Party Committees of each commune and the Party branches of production teams also implement special personnel management, forming a strong front from top to bottom. In order to improve work efficiency, irrigation experimental fields were established at all levels throughout the county, from top to bottom. Model pumping stations were vigorously promoted, and on-site visits were frequently used as a way to learn from schools and use model pumping stations as teaching materials, launching a red flag competition for high efficiency between stations, between pumping stations, and between individuals, learning, catching up, surpassing, and helping each other. Throughout the county, there were four pumping stations with an average irrigation capacity of more than 400 mu per horsepower, and twenty-one pumping stations with more than 300 mu.
    Water pumps are modern, large-scale production tools, and can only fully exert their effectiveness when used on larger areas of land. During the period of advanced cooperatives, due to the small scope and dispersed land, water pumps were used separately, which limited the effectiveness of the water pumps. Jiaxing County has given full play to the superior conditions of the people's communes, such as their large organizational scale and wide range of activities, and established water pump management stations with the commune as the unit. All water pumps of the production teams were organized together according to the principles of voluntary mutual benefit, equivalent exchange, and benefit to production. Management methods such as unified management, unified planning and allocation, unified repair and protection, unified distribution of machine parts, and unified innovation and experimentation were adopted. The irrigation area and machine arrangement were adjusted according to the size of the plots, crops, water demand time, and water demand. This overcame the imbalance in the number of water pumps between teams and overcame the contradiction that machines were limited by the scope of the economy. At the same time, because the commune's mechanical management station has full-time cadres and technicians, it can strengthen the ideological education of water pump operators and water release personnel, provide timely technical guidance, and facilitate the exchange and promotion of good experiences in technological innovation. According to statistics, the average irrigation area per horsepower of water pumps used by the water pump management station is generally more than twice as high as that used by production teams separately.
    Second, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and actively promoting advanced experiences without increasing mechanical equipment is also a major measure to rapidly improve mechanical efficiency. In the technical innovation movement, the focus is on increasing the water output per unit of time, but it also includes aspects such as safe operation of machines and reducing costs. In the movement, the Jiaxing County Party Committee vigorously launched mass movements, set up pacesetters, grasped advanced elements, and promptly summarized and promoted advanced experiences. In the spring of this year, the County Party Committee specifically summarized and promoted the advanced experience of the Jiaxing Water Pump Station, a local state-owned enterprise, in irrigating 204 mu per horsepower last year, and called on all water pump stations and communes throughout the county to tap the potential of equipment and vigorously carry out technical innovations centered on increasing water output, striving to expand the irrigation area without adding equipment. Soon, a wave of innovation in which everyone was striving to innovate and create emerged throughout the county, and the potential of machinery and equipment was increasingly tapped. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the staff of the Jiaxing Water Pump Station, a local state-owned enterprise, boldly created and adopted methods such as reducing elbows and modifying the canal head, creating the experience of "using a small machine to pull a large pump" using a 12-horsepower machine to pull a 14-inch water pump, which doubled the efficiency. The staff of the Gaoqiaobei Pumping Station of the Chezha Commune used a 7-kilowatt electric motor. After shortening the pipeline and other measures to reduce the horsepower load, they dragged two centrifugal water pumps, one 12-inch and one 10-inch, creating the experience of "one machine with two pumps," which increased the water output efficiency by more than two times. Jiaxing County has successively promoted 288 advanced measures to increase water output, such as "small machine towing large pump," "one machine towing two pumps," and "water pump falling into the cabin, reducing the head," which can irrigate more than 200,000 mu of farmland. Calculated at an average of 100 mu of irrigation per horsepower, it is equivalent to increasing more than 2,000 horsepower of water pumps.
    Third, repair irrigation and drainage canals and do a good job in water management. Canalization of irrigation and drainage is an inseparable whole with mechanization of irrigation and drainage, and it is also the basis for giving full play to the efficiency of mechanical irrigation. Jiaxing County, in response to the new situation of past canals used for human and animal-powered water carts being unsystematic and not in line with the use of mechanical irrigation and drainage, used the favorable conditions of contiguous land after communization. Before the spring plowing, a large-scale basic construction of irrigation and drainage canals was carried out, using more than 300,000 man-days to repair relatively complete irrigation canals, with a total length of 1,200 kilometers, benefiting more than 420,000 mu of farmland, ensuring smooth irrigation of farmland. Now the main, branch, and capillary-level canals in the county have initially taken shape. At the same time, the county has vigorously promoted planned water use and rotational irrigation systems, and water management committees have been generally established with the water pump station as the unit, equipped with full-time water release personnel, and water use covenants have been formulated. This is very beneficial to saving water, using water rationally, and expanding the irrigation area. (Attached picture)

　　让抽水机发挥更大威力
　　——浙江嘉兴县提高机械排灌效率的经验
　　朱学亿
    浙江嘉兴县农田机械排灌事业，在成立公社一年来，获得了飞跃发展。全县抽水机灌溉能力平均每马力已达一百六十六亩，比解放前每马力灌田十六亩增加九倍多，比去年每马力灌田一百零三亩提高了61％，比浙江全省平均每马力灌田九十多亩提高了60％以上，成为全省大面积机械排灌效率最高纪录。由于机械排灌效率提高，今年全县排灌面积比1958年扩大了四十六万亩。到目前为止，嘉兴全县农田的机械排灌面积已经达到一百二十三万亩，占全县水田总面积的87.3％，基本上实现了农田排灌机械化。
    一年来，嘉兴县在提高抽水机利用率方面，主要有如下三点经验：
    第一，党委加强了对这项工作的领导。嘉兴县委有一个书记专门领导农田机械排灌工作，各公社党委和生产队的党支部也实行专人专管，从上到下形成了一条强有力的战线。为了提高工效，在全县范围内从上到下层层建立排灌试验田，大搞标兵机埠，经常以现场参观为学校、标兵机埠作教材的办法，展开站与站、埠与埠、人与人之间的学、赶、超、帮高工效红旗竞赛。全县出现了平均每马力灌田四百亩以上的有四个机埠，三百亩以上的有二十一个机埠。
    抽水机是现代化的大型的生产工具，只有在较大面积的土地上使用，才能充分发挥效能。高级社时由于范围小，土地比较分散，抽水机又都各自分散使用，限制了抽水机效能的发挥。嘉兴县充分发挥了人民公社组织规模大、活动范围广等优越条件，以公社为单位建立了抽水机管理站，把生产队所有的抽水机，根据自愿互利、等价交换和有利生产的原则，组织在一起，并采取了统一管理、统一规划调配、统一修理保护、统一机件配货、统一革新试验等经营管理的办法。按田块大小、作物、需水时间和需水量，调整灌区和安排机器。这样就克服了队与队之间抽水机数量上存在的不平衡现象，并克服了机器受经济范围限制的矛盾。同时，因为公社机械管理站有专职干部和技工，可以加强对抽水机手和放水员的思想教育，及时进行技术辅导，又便于交流和推广技术革新中的好经验。据统计，抽水机管理站使用的抽水机，平均每马力灌田面积，一般比由生产队各自分散使用高一倍以上。
    第二，在不增加机械设备的前提下，大闹技术革新，积极推广先进经验，也是迅速提高机械效能的主要措施。在技术革新运动中，中心是提高单位时间的出水量，同时也包括机器安全运转、降低成本等方面。嘉兴县委在运动中，大搞群众运动，立标兵、抓先进，及时总结推广先进经验。今年春天，县委专门总结和推广了地方国营嘉兴抽水机站去年创造的每马力灌田二百零四亩的先进经验，并号召全县各抽水机站、各公社大挖设备潜力，大闹以提高出水量为中心的技术革新，力争不添设备扩大排灌面积，很快就在全县范围内形成了一个你追我赶的人人闹革新、个个搞创造的浪潮，机器设备潜力越挖越大。地方国营嘉兴抽水机站职工，在党支部领导下，大胆创造，采取减少弯管，改装渠首等办法，创造了用十二马力机器拖十四寸水泵的“小机拖大泵”的经验，效率成倍提高。车栅公社高桥北机埠职工，用七瓩电动机，经过缩短管路等措施，减轻了马力负荷，拖了十二寸和十寸离心水泵各一台的“一机带双泵”的经验，出水效能提高二倍多。嘉兴县先后在全县范围内推广了“小机拖大泵”、“一机拖双泵”、“水泵落舱、降低扬程”等增加出水量的先进措施二百八十八项，增加的出水量可以多灌溉农田二十多万亩。如以平均每马力灌田一百亩计算，等于增加了二千多马力的抽水机。
    第三，大修排灌渠道，做好用水管理工作。排灌渠道化是与排灌机械化不可分割的整体，也是充分发挥机械灌溉效率的基础。嘉兴县针对过去以人、畜力车水用的渠道不成系统、不符合机械排灌使用的新情况，利用公社化后土地连片的有利条件，在春耕前夕，大规模地进行了排灌渠道的基本建设工作，用了三十多万个人工，修理了比较完整的灌溉渠道，长达一千二百公里，受益农田达四十二万多亩，保证了农田灌溉通畅无阻。现在全县干、支、毛级渠道已初具规模。与此同时，全县还大力推广了计划用水和轮灌制度，普遍以抽水机站为单位建立了用水管理委员会，配有专职放水员，制定了用水公约。这对节约用水、合理用水、扩大灌溉面积很有好处。（附图片）
