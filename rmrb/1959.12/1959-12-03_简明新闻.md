　　Cultivating Earthworms for Feed

　　The Hemei Production Team of Zhaoxiang Commune in Qingpu County, Shanghai, artificially cultivates earthworms as poultry feed. Their method is: choose fertile, moist land and deeply till it six inches, cut the earthworms into segments and scatter them on the ground, then cover them with three inches of decaying grass, watering them two or three times a day, and applying diluted human manure appropriately. Earthworms can be cultivated in about twenty days, yielding 800 jin of earthworms per mu.

　　Successful Bee Keeping on the Qinghai Plateau

　　The Fourth Farm of the Jiemen United Enterprise Company in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, has successfully experimented with beekeeping on the plateau. This farm is located on the Sujitan Plateau in northern Qinghai Province, at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters, where the lowest winter temperature is minus 20 degrees Celsius. This factory purchased 60 colonies of improved bee breeds this year, and after careful breeding, it has now grown to 70 colonies.

　　Winter Fish Farming

　　The Sanhebao Management Area of Tianjiaz Commune in Kangping County, Liaoning Province, is vigorously developing winter fish farming. More than 300 young people in the management area have used their spare time to build four large fish ponds, covering a total area of 1,500 square meters, and have now stocked more than 300,000 fish fry. The young people's fish farming activities have been praised by the commune members, some of whom said: "In the past, the water flowed away, the river dried up, and the fish were gone, yielding nothing; this year, we are building ponds, storing water, and raising fish, increasing our income."
