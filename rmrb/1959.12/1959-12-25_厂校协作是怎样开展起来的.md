　　How Factory-School Collaboration Developed
　　By the Cultural and Education Department of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　Schools running factories is a product of implementing the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. It is the result of the struggle between two lines in the educational revolution.

　　After the call for part-work study was sounded throughout the country last year, students and some teachers in Taiyuan's secondary schools, after studying the Party's educational policy, raised their awareness and quickly plunged into this revolutionary torrent. They appeared in droves and vying with each other at construction sites, workshops, shops, and streets; some dug and transported earth, some cleaned machine tools, some sold goods, some sold newspapers... They were determined to temper themselves and transform themselves in the most arduous labor. After a period of sustained labor, as expected, many people were transformed in the labor, and tremendous changes took place in their thinking and feelings. Moreover, the frequent appearance of large numbers of students and teachers in workplaces greatly changed the social atmosphere. The traditional concept of the exploiting class that "all occupations are mean except for studying" began to be replaced by the understanding that "all occupations are valuable, but labor is the most noble."

　　During this stage of part-work study, we consciously educated the younger generation through productive labor not to become detached from reality because of studying, and not to put on the airs of intellectuals because of studying. At the same time, through labor practice, we explained that the purpose of our socialist education is to cultivate conscious and cultured laborers, not to lead students down the wrong path of deviating from politics, deviating from production, deviating from reality, and despising manual labor and manual laborers, as bourgeois education does. We used practical actions to promote the policy of socialist education and demonstrated the fundamental difference between proletarian education and bourgeois education.

　　During the period of part-work study, those who insisted on the bourgeois view of education either openly opposed it or subtly criticized it, saying that students participating in labor "disrupted school order" and "affected the quality of education," and so on. Faced with these erroneous arguments, we launched debates on the two lines among teachers and students, and at the same time, resolutely carried out part-work study activities in accordance with the Party's policy. This enabled the vast majority of teachers and students to not only enrich their knowledge and strengthen their physique through labor, but also to transform from despising labor to loving labor, turning productive labor from a burden into a joy. After the vast majority of teachers and students improved their understanding, the bourgeois educational viewpoint was isolated, and their position was greatly reduced.

　　Adopting the above forms for part-work study was essential. However, many inconveniences also arose in combining it with teaching. Generally speaking, the labor places were far from the schools, there were many contradictions between labor time and study time, and teachers had certain difficulties in providing tutoring on site. This raised a new question: Under the premise of focusing on education, what form of labor is more appropriate? Based on the experience of part-work study and in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee, the Municipal Party Committee promptly put forward the instruction of schools running factories and farms, and the movement of schools running factories on a large scale was launched like a huge wave, thus advancing part-work study to a new stage. In the month of July alone last year, secondary schools established a large number of factories, and at that time, there were truly forests of factories, and the atmosphere was ever changing. All these factories showed the characteristics of being small, indigenous, diverse, fast, effective, and economical: small scale, indigenous methods, many varieties, fast speed, good results, and saving money.

　　The reason why schools running factories can develop at high speed is mainly because the Party's general line and educational policy have deeply penetrated people's hearts, enabling the vast majority of teachers and students to liberate their minds, break superstitions, dare to think and dare to act, and unleash their soaring drive. At the same time, schools running factories is also a form of closely combining productive labor with teaching and scientific research, which further improves the quality of teaching. Also, because the products of these factories directly serve social needs, the factories run by schools can not only be consolidated, but also gradually develop forward.

　　After schools ran factories on a large scale, the appearance of the schools took on a completely new look, and the vast majority of teachers and students further recognized the correctness of the Party's educational policy. In the face of the new situation, people with bourgeois ideas, although there were fewer and fewer people who openly opposed it, the clamor did not subside, but changed to another tune. They believed that if factories were to be run, they should be large, and if factories were to be run, they should be modern. This seemed to be a struggle between two methods, but in essence it was still a reflection of the struggle between two lines. We criticized this erroneous view, protected the enthusiasm of the masses, and protected the growth of new things.

　　The factories run by schools have been improved after rectification, but some new problems have also emerged, such as insufficient supply of raw materials, lack of equipment, and insufficient technical strength, which resulted in production not being able to proceed normally. After studying these problems, the Municipal Party Committee, at the city-wide collaboration meeting in February this year, put forward the policy that schools running factories must serve the needs of large industries, agriculture, and people's lives under the premise of combining with teaching. At the same time, it pointed out that factory-school collaboration, with factories setting up workshops in schools, is a good form that is both beneficial to teaching and beneficial to production, and is a good form for implementing the combination of education and productive labor. This approach was approved and supported by everyone, and then twenty middle schools and more than thirty factories and mines established collaborative relationships. However, new problems were encountered in implementing the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, namely: schools required the collaborating factories to first help them equip a small factory or workshop in order to better combine teaching and productive labor; while factories were eager to require schools to support a large amount of labor and cultural instructors, and were concerned about the requirements of schools to establish small factories or workshops, worrying that "technical strength is lacking and production tasks cannot be completed." It is conceivable that the requirements and concerns of both sides are reasonable, and the question is where to start to solve them. According to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, we first linked up factories and schools as a preparatory stage for building factories. The schools first dispatched a large number of students to the collaborating factories to carry out labor according to the factory's plan. Some of them operated on machine tools, some acted as handymen, and some helped workers learn culture. After a period of time, many of these cultured young laborers initially mastered more complex technologies, cultivating a certain amount of technical strength for the factory to set up workshops in schools. The original contradiction existing in factory-school collaboration was also resolved through this method. Immediately afterwards, in a very short period of time, more than ten factories established mechanical processing, chemical and other production workshops in more than ten middle schools. In these workshops, some started from casting, and after processing, completed the manufacture of parts, and some directly produced chemical products, and the quality of the finished products basically reached the quality standards stipulated by the state.

　　Facts have proved that after these workshops were established, they are both satellite factories of the collaborating factories, undertaking some scattered production tasks, so that the collaborating factories can draw out the main strength to engage in the main production. More importantly, it enables the collaborating factories to achieve the requirements of increasing production without increasing people. At the same time, it has become a school's practice factory. Under the premise that the collaborating factory solves the supply of raw materials and technical guidance, the school organizes students to participate in productive labor nearby, which makes it easy to properly arrange teaching and production time according to the teaching plan, and facilitates the combination of theory and practice, combining book knowledge with production practice, making the factory a teaching site for science and engineering, and effectively improving the quality of education. Factory-school collaboration has benefited both sides and satisfied both sides. Many people happily and humorously called the entire process of factory-school collaboration: factory-school linkage is "love," factory-run workshops is "marriage," and the manufactured accessories and finished products are "babies."

　　Looking back at the development path from part-work study through large-scale factory building to factory-school collaboration, the main reason is that we have unswervingly implemented the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and we have made the implementation of this policy the task of the whole Party and the whole people, widely and deeply carried out propaganda and education, and obtained the approval and support of all aspects. The implementation of the Party's educational policy is a great revolution in the cause of education. In the process of carrying out this revolution, some people agree, but some people oppose it. No matter what arguments the opponents adopt, their essence is the struggle between the two lines of proletarian education and bourgeois education. In this struggle, on the one hand, we systematically criticized various erroneous viewpoints in theory, and at the same time, we boldly mobilized the masses, adopted the method of vigorously carrying out mass movements, and actively carried out productive labor activities, which combined education and productive labor, improved the quality of education, and shattered the slanders of the bourgeoisie with facts. All these victories were achieved under the absolute leadership of the Party. Facts have proved that strengthening the leadership of the Party and adhering to putting politics in command is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve all victories.

　　厂校协作是怎样开展起来的
　　中共太原市委文教部
    学校办工厂是贯彻党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的产物。是在教育大革命中进行两条道路斗争的结果。
    去年勤工俭学的号角在全国响起之后，太原市中等学校的学生和部分教师，经过对党的教育方针的学习，提高了觉悟，迅速地卷入了这一革命的洪流。他们成群结队、争先恐后地出现在工地、车间、商店和街道；有的挖运土方，有的擦洗机床，有的售货，有的卖报，……他们决心在最艰苦的劳动中锻炼自己，改造自己。经过一段持续地劳动之后，果然，有很多人在劳动中得到了改造，思想感情上发生了巨大的变化。不仅如此，成批的学生和教师经常在劳动场所的出现，也大大地改变了社会的风气。那种“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的剥削阶级的传统观念，开始被“万般皆可贵，劳动最为高”的认识所代替。
    在勤工俭学的这一阶段，我们有意识地通过生产劳动，教育青年一代不要因为念书而脱离实际，不要因为念书而摆起了知识分子的架子。同时，通过劳动实践，说明我们社会主义教育的目的，就是为了培养有觉悟有文化的劳动者，而不是像资产阶级的教育那样，把学生引导到脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际，轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者的错误道路上去。我们用实际行动，宣传了社会主义教育的方针，用实际行动表明了无产阶级教育与资产阶级教育的根本区别。
    在勤工俭学时期，坚持资产阶级教育观的人，有的公开反对，有的旁敲侧击，说什么学生参加劳动“打乱了学校秩序”“影响了教育质量”等等。面对这些错误论调，我们一方面在师生中开展了两条道路的辩论，同时，坚决地按照党的方针进行了勤工俭学活动。使广大师生通过劳动，不仅丰富了知识，增强了体质，而且从轻视劳动转变为热爱劳动，把生产劳动从一种重负变为一种快乐。在广大师生提高了认识之后，资产阶级教育观点就被孤立了起来，他们的阵地也随之大大缩小了。
    采取上述形式进行勤工俭学是十分必要的。但在结合教学方面，却也发生了许多不便。一般说，劳动场所距离学校较远，劳动时间和学习时间的矛盾较多，教师跟班辅导也有一定困难。这就提出一个新的问题：在以教育为主的前提下，采用什么形式进行劳动较为合适？市委在总结了勤工俭学经验的基础上，根据中央精神，及时地提出了学校办工厂和农场的指示，学校大办工厂的运动，就像巨浪一样地掀了起来，从而把勤工俭学推进到一个新的阶段。仅在去年7月份一个月内，中等学校就办起了大批工厂，那时真是工厂林立，气象万千。所有这些工厂又都表现了规模不大、土法上马、品种繁多、速度很快、效果很好、花钱很少的小、土、多、快、好、省的特点。
    学校办工厂之所以能够高速度地发展起来，主要是由于党的总路线和教育方针深入人心，使广大师生解放了思想，破除了迷信，敢想敢干，发挥了冲天的干劲的结果。同时，学校办工厂，也是使生产劳动和教学和科学研究密切结合起来的一种形式。进一步提高了教学质量。也还由于这些工厂的产品又都直接服务于社会需要，这就使学校办的工厂不仅能够巩固，而且能够逐步地向前发展。
    学校大办工厂之后，学校面貌焕然一新，广大师生进一步认识了党的教育方针的正确。具有资产阶级思想的人，在新的形势面前，公开反对的人虽然越来越少了，但是叫嚣之声并未敛迹，只是换上了另一种曲牌，他们认为要办工厂就办大的，要办工厂就办现代化的。看来是一个两种方法的斗争，但实质上还是两条道路斗争的反映。我们针对这种错误观点进行了批判，保护了群众的积极性，保护了新生事物的成长。
    学校办的工厂，经过整顿之后有了提高，但也出现了一些新的问题。如原材料供应不足，缺乏设备，技术力量不足等，以致生产不能正常进行。市委研究了这些问题之后，在今年2月全市协作会议上，提出了学校办工厂必须在结合教学的前提下，服务于大工业、农业和人民生活需要的方针，同时指出了厂校协作，工厂在学校设置车间，是既利于教学又利于生产，是贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的一种良好形式。这一办法得到了大家的赞成和拥护，随即有二十个中学和三十多个厂矿建立了协作关系。但是，在贯彻执行市委的指示中又碰到了新的问题，即：学校要求协作厂首先帮助自己装备一个小厂或车间，以便更好地把教学和生产劳动结合起来；而工厂却又急于要求学校支援大量的劳力和文化教员，对于学校建立小厂或车间的要求抱着“缺少技术力量，完不成生产任务”的顾虑。可以想见，双方的要求和顾虑都是合理的，问题在于从那里着手解决。我们根据市委的指示，首先使厂校双方挂起钩来，做为建厂的准备阶段。学校首先派遣大批学生到协作厂按照厂里的计划进行劳动。其中有的在机床上操作，有的当杂工，有的帮助职工学习文化。经过一段时间之后，这批有文化的青年劳动者有许多人初步掌握了较为复杂的技术，为工厂在学校附设车间培养了一定的技术力量，原来存在于厂校协作中的矛盾，也就通过这种办法获得解决。紧接着，在很短的时间内，就有十多个工厂在十多个中学中建立了机械加工、化学等生产车间。在这些车间中，有的从铸造开始，经过加工，完成了部件的制造，有的直接制成了化学产品，而成品质量也都基本上达到了国家规定的质量标准。
    事实证明，这些车间建立以后，它既是协作厂的卫星厂，承担一些零星的生产任务，使协作厂可以抽出主要力量从事主要的生产，更重要的是使协作厂能在不增人的情况下达到增产的要求；同时，它又成为学校的实习工厂，学校在协作厂解决原料供应和技术指导的前提下，就近组织学生参加生产劳动，这就便于根据教学计划妥善地安排教学和生产的时间，便于理论联系实际，把书本知识和生产实践结合起来，使工厂成为理工科教学的现场，有效地提高教育质量。厂校协作做到了双方有利，双方满意。很多人高兴地把厂校协作的整个过程诙谐地叫做：厂校挂钩是“恋爱”厂办车间是“结婚”，制做的附件和成品是“婴儿”。
    回顾从勤工俭学经过大办工厂到厂校协作的发展道路，主要是我们坚定不移地贯彻执行了党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，并把这一方针的贯彻做为全党全民的任务，广泛深入地进行了宣传教育，取得了各方面的赞成和支持，党的教育方针的贯彻是教育事业中的一场大革命，在进行这一革命过程中，有人赞成，但也有人反对。反对者不管采取什么论调，但其实质都是无产阶级教育和资产阶级教育两条道路的斗争，在这场斗争中，我们一方面从理论上系统地批判了各种错误观点，同时，放手地发动群众，采取大搞群众运动的办法，积极地开展了生产劳动的活动，使教育和生产劳动结合了起来，提高了教育质量，用事实粉碎了资产阶级的诽谤，所有这些胜利，都是在党的绝对领导下取得的。事实证明，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，这是我们取得一切胜利的根本保证。
