Rising Prices苦害 the People
Consumer Goods Prices Rise Seven Times in Eight Months
According to an announcement by the U.S. Department of Labor on the 22nd, the cost of living in the United States continued to rise in November.

The Labor Department said that the U.S. consumer price index rose to 125.6 in November (with 1947-1949 as 100). In October, the index was 125.5.

This is the seventh increase in the last eight months. The prices of many commodities have risen, and transportation costs and rents have also increased. Clothing prices are the highest in nearly thirty years.

According to materials from the U.S. Department of Labor, the average wages of factory workers decreased in October, and their purchasing power also declined. The Labor Department predicts that prices will continue to rise, especially the prices of steel products.

This increase in the cost of living indicates that the trend of inflation in the United States continues to develop. Huge military expenditures are one of the main causes of inflation.

The rise in the cost of living has a fatal impact on the situation of people with meager incomes. American farmers are also harmed by rising prices. In the third quarter, their cash income was 28% lower than in the same period last year.

The rise in food prices primarily benefits large companies and monopolistic trading organizations that process agricultural raw materials.

For example, while farmers' incomes decreased, the profits of Safe Trading Company increased by 13.6% in the third quarter, and the profits of two other trading companies—General Foods Corporation and Beatrice Foods Company—increased by 20%.

The increase in the cost of living leads to a decline in the real wages of the working people. This is a major reason for the increasing struggle of strikes in the United States. In the first nine months of this year, 3,225 strikes occurred in the United States, with a total of 1.77 million workers participating in the strikes. After September, the surging strike wave not only did not stop, but on the contrary, it intensified day by day. Large-scale strikes not only occurred in the steel industry sector with 500,000 workers, but also in the mining, automobile, and meat canning industries. Dockworkers and many other workers in the United States have also held strikes. There are still many strikes in the United States now. A railway workers' strike is about to break out, because wage reductions and extremely poor working conditions are threatening them.

### 物价上涨　害苦人民  八个月内消费品价格上升七次

　　物价上涨　害苦人民
    八个月内消费品价格上升七次
    据美国劳工部22日宣布，美国的生活费用在11月份继续上涨。
    劳工部说，美国消费品价格指数在11月份上涨到一百二十五点六（以1947—1949年为一百）。在10月份，这个指数是一百二十五点五。
    这是最近八个月来第七次上升。许多商品的价格上涨了，交通运输费和房租也增加了。服装的价格是近三十年来最高的。
    根据美国劳工部的材料，10月份工厂工人的平均工资减少了，他们的购买力也下降了。劳工部预测物价还会上涨，特别是钢制品的价格。
    这次生活费用上涨表明，美国通货膨胀的趋势在继续发展。军费的庞大开支是通货膨胀的主要原因之一。
    生活费用的上涨对收入微薄的人的境况有致命的影响。美国农民也受到物价上涨的损害。在第三季度，他们的现金收入比去年同时期低28％。
    食品价格的上涨首先对加工农业原料的大公司和垄断贸易组织有利。
    例如，在农民的收入降低的同时，安全贸易公司的利润在第三季度增加了13.6％，另外两家贸易公司——通用食品公司和比阿特里斯食品公司的利润增加了20％。
    生活费用的提高，造成劳动人民的实际工资的下降。这是美国的罢工斗争日益加强的一个主要原因。在今年头九个月内，美国发生了三千二百二十五次罢工，参加罢工的工人共有一百七十七万。9月以后，汹涌澎湃的罢工浪潮不仅没有停止，相反却日益高涨了。大罢工不仅发生在有五十万工人的钢铁工业部门中，而且也发生在采矿、汽车、肉类罐头等工业部门中。码头搬运工人和美国其他许多工人也举行过罢工。现在美国仍然有不少的罢工。铁路员工罢工大有一触即发之势，因为工资降低和十分恶劣的劳动条件在威胁着他们。
