Suggestion

　　Seize the Time to Repair Field Ridges
    Combining water conservancy construction with field ridge repair is a win-win situation. In this regard, Yanglousi Commune in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, has done a very good job. First, they formed a professional field ridge repair team and adopted the methods of "adding" (raising the low ones, widening the narrow ones), "building" (compacting loose soil and loopholes), "supplementing" (thickening the thin ones), and "constructing" (building new ones where there are no field ridges). They repaired more than 34,000 field ridges and built more than 8,500 new ones. In this way, the entire commune achieved water retention in every plot, preventing leakage, resistance to large floods, and water storage during droughts.
    Compared with other production tasks, repairing field ridges is a "small" task that is easily overlooked. However, if field ridges are not well repaired, water and fertilizer loss will inevitably occur, affecting next year's increased production.

　　抓紧时机修整田塍
    把兴修水利和修整田塍结合起来，是一举两得之事。在这一点上，湖南临湘县羊楼司公社做得很好，他们首先是组成了一支专业修田塍的队伍，采用了“加”（矮的加高、窄的加宽）、“筑”（松土漏洞筑坚固）、“补”（单薄的补厚）、“建”（没有田塍的新建）的办法，共修补田塍三万四千多条，新建田塍八千五百多条。就这样，全社做到了丘丘有水不漏，大水冲不垮，天旱能蓄水。
    修整田塍和其他生产任务比较，是一件“细小”的工作，容易被人忽视；但是田塍不修整好，必然会造成水肥流失，影响明年增产。
