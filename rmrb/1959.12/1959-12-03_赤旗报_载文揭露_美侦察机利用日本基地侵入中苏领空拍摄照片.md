Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th. An article published in today's "Red Flag" newspaper reveals that a type of black aircraft frequently seen in Japan recently – US military reconnaissance planes – with the tacit approval of the Nobusuke Kishi government, takes off daily from the Atsugi base in Japan, secretly intruding into the airspace of China and the Soviet Union at an altitude of 20,000 meters, using its high-performance cameras to photograph the situation in China and the Soviet Union.

According to the revelation, these aircraft are equipped with radar countermeasures to detect enemy radar, infrared imagers, weather testing equipment and other reconnaissance devices.

According to "Red Flag," on September 24th, a black aircraft landed at the Fujisawa airport. Civilians who were conducting glider training at the airport at the time thought the aircraft had crashed and wanted to rush to rescue it, but they were driven away at gunpoint by US soldiers who arrived by helicopter.

According to reports, the magazine "Aviation Information" published a photograph taken by Koji Matsuzaki at Atsugi Airport last year of this type of black aircraft. Subsequently, he was summoned for questioning by the US military.

According to Japanese radio reports, the Kanagawa Prefectural Federation of the Japan Socialist Party today submitted a letter of inquiry to the Commander of the US Naval Air Force, Nelson, and the Commander of the Atsugi Base, Hulmark, regarding the incident of the US military's black aircraft. The letter of inquiry stated that these black jet aircraft have no nationality markings or markings of the air wing to which they belong, which is an act that disregards international law.

According to the Kanagawa Prefectural Federation of the Socialist Party, if the mission of the US military's black aircraft cannot be clarified, thorough questioning will continue in the Japanese Diet and other institutions.

    “赤旗报”载文揭露
    美侦察机利用日本基地侵入中苏领空拍摄照片
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天发表的一篇文章揭露，最近以来在日本常常被发现的一种黑色飞机——美军侦察机，在岸信介政府默许下，每天从日本厚木基地起飞，以二万米的高度偷偷侵入中国和苏联的领空，用它装备的高性能照像机拍摄中苏两国的情况。
    据揭露，这种飞机装有探知对方雷达的反雷达装置、红外线透视机和气象测验机等等性能侦察装置。
    据“赤旗报”报道，9月24日曾经有一架黑色飞机降落在藤泽机场，当时在那个机场进行滑翔机训练的民间人士以为这架飞机失事，想前往抢救，但是却被坐着直升飞机赶来的美军士兵持枪赶走。
    据报道，“航空情报”杂志去年曾经刊登了松崎幸治在厚木机场上拍摄的这种黑色飞机的像片。随后，他就被美军叫去讯问。
    据日本电台报道，日本社会党神奈川县联合会今天就美军的黑色飞机事件向正在日本活动的美国海军航空队司令官尼尔逊和厚木基地司令官赫尔马克提出质问书。质问书说，这种黑色喷气式飞机没有国籍标帜和它所属的航空队的标帜，是无视国际法的行为。
    据社会党神奈川县联合会说，如果不能弄清楚美军黑色飞机的任务等问题，今后还要在日本国会和其他机构中进行彻底的追问。
