    The Song on the Kunlun Mountains
    Zhang Fujie
    One morning, I took a jeep from Golmud to the construction site of the Kunlun Hydropower Station. What appeared before me was a vast and boundless Gobi desert. Kazakh herdsmen drove teams of camels, walking leisurely on the sand. Tall drilling rigs stood like giants in the wilderness.
    The car was constantly going uphill. After driving for about forty minutes, we arrived at the Kunlun Mountains. The majestic Kunlun Mountains, like a huge screen, separated us from the outside world; the steep peaks kissed the white clouds, and the snow on the mountaintops sparkled in the sunlight. The Kunlun River, like a sharp sword, split the mountain in half, flowing through it. The mountain valley was a city of white and yellow tents, and melodious songs were sent out from the radio; the rumbling blasting sound echoed like thunder in the mountain valley; the generators sang with a booming sound; drilling rigs were dotted everywhere, and red flags fluttered in the wind.
    Passing through a tent area, we arrived at the bank of the Kunlun River. Here, there are two iron-cable bridges over seventy meters long; the iron wire railings on the bridge are hung with slogans such as "Building power stations on the plateau, man will surely conquer nature!" Stepping on the bridge deck, we felt as if we were thrown into the clouds, floating up and down. Looking down from the iron-cable bridge, the rapid waves are turbulent and surging. Both sides of the river are vertical cliffs, with a dangerous situation. Looking upstream, you can see a lake-shaped depression. The comrade in charge of the construction site pointed to that depression and said to us, "Its exit is only a dozen meters wide. As long as a dam is built there, the water in the Kunlun River can be stored effortlessly." He introduced that this hydropower station was officially started in July of this year and is expected to generate electricity in the first half of next year.
    Passing through the iron-cable bridge, we arrived at the construction site. There were crowds of people everywhere; light railways crisscrossed, and dump trucks ran like flying. Some workers were carrying steel rails, and some were drilling blasting holes. The female comrades with flower towels tied on their heads, carrying cheerful laughter, ran back and forth like shuttles pushing their carts. Some technicians were gesturing with blueprints, and some were carrying theodolites to measure. Many moving slogans were pasted on the cars and telephone poles in red and green. The sounds of songs, shouts, cries of mutual competition, the clanging of hammers, the rumbling of wheels, and the thumping of explosions resounded throughout the construction site, and resounded throughout the silent Kunlun Mountains.
    There were no inhabitants here in the past. Besides the vast sandy wasteland, there were only bare mountains. Some people once used "no birds fly on the mountain, no grass grows on the ground" to describe its desolation. Since the construction of the hydropower station here, wisps of smoke have begun to rise, and there is an atmosphere of life. However, our workers live happily and energetically even in such an environment.
    Besides the tents, there is not even a temporary house here. The staff with families, in order to solve the housing problem, used their spare time to dig pits in the ground, and covered them with tarpaulins and mats, which became "basements." In order to distinguish the household names, everyone numbered them door to door and marked them with wooden signs, one next to the other, continuously for several hundred meters. People smiled and called it "Family Street" and "Underground Palace." The workers said it was more exciting than a building, because it was both windproof and warm.
    The workers piled the transported bricks into a rectangle, covered them with a few tarpaulins, which rattled in the wind. Inside, there were only some bricks piled up haphazardly, empty without a table or a bench. Light came in through the brick holes - this is their only "cinema." The optimistic workers also erected a wooden sign at the entrance, with the words "Kunlun Cinema" neatly written in red and blue.
    We also saw the basketball court opened up by the workers themselves. The basketball hoop was made by planting a fir pole in the ground and nailing an iron ring on it. A comrade smiled and said to the comrade in charge of the construction site: "This basketball hoop is very interesting, but it would be even better if you could nail some wooden boards on it. Don't you even have these few wooden boards?" The comrade in charge of the construction site replied excitedly: "We do have wooden boards, but these wooden boards are all transported from the remote inland and Tibet, and the workers are reluctant to use them." Here, the workers cherish every screw, every small piece of wood. You can often find on the construction site that some workers, without taking off their shoes and socks, jump into the freezing snow river to rescue a piece of wood or a bamboo sieve that has been washed away by the water. The "Underground Palace", "Cinema" and ball court built by our workers themselves did not cost the country a penny...
    At this time, it was dusk, and the fiery red sunset gave the Kunlun Mountains, which resembled a screen, a golden light. Suddenly, from the "Underground Palace" and the tents came rough laughter and the melodious sounds of the erhu and the transverse flute. This light music, along the Kunlun Mountains and the Kunlun River, spread the joyful mood of the construction heroes on the plateau to all parts of the motherland...

### 昆仑山上的歌声

    昆仑山上的歌声
    张福阶
    一个上午，我从?尔穆坐吉普车前往昆仑水电站工地。眼前出现的是一片茫茫无际的戈壁滩，哈萨克牧民赶着一队队的骆驼，在沙滩上从容地行走。高高的钻塔，像巨人一般屹立在旷野上。
    汽车一直走着上坡路。约莫行驶了四十分钟，我们到了昆仑山。巍峨的昆仑山，像巨大的屏风，把我们和外界隔离开来；陡峭的山峰吻着白云，山顶的积雪在阳光下银光闪闪。昆仑河像一把利剑，把山劈成两半，从中穿流而过。山沟里是一片白色的和黄色的帐篷城，广播器里送出悠扬的歌声；隆隆的爆破声雷鸣般在山峪里回响；发电机在轰隆隆地歌唱；钻塔星罗棋布，红旗迎风招展……。
    穿过一片帐篷，就到了昆仑河边。这里有两座七十余米长的铁索桥；桥上的铁丝栏杆上挂着“高原建电站，人定能胜天！”的标语。踏上桥板，我们仿佛被抛上了云端，飘飘然一起一落。从铁索桥上俯首下望，急浪滔滔，汹涌澎湃。河两岸尽是垂直的峭壁，形势险峻。往上游望去，可以看到一个湖形大洼地。工地负责同志指着那块洼地对我们说：“它的出口处只有十几米宽，只要在那里拦起一道坝，就可以不费力地把昆仑河里的水蓄起来。”他介绍说，这座水电站是在今年7月才正式动工修建的，预计明年上半年就可以发电了。
    通过铁索桥，就到了工地。只见到处人山人海；轻便铁道纵横密布，斗车奔跑如飞。工人们有的在搬运钢轨，有的在打炮眼。头上扎着花毛巾的女同志，带着爽朗的笑声，推着车子穿梭般跑来跑去。技术人员有的拿着蓝图在比划着，有的扛着经纬仪在测量。车子上、电线杆上红红绿绿贴了许多动人的标语口号。歌声、号子声、互相竞赛的叫喊声、叮当的铁锤声、隆隆的车轮声、通通的爆破声，响彻了整个工地，响彻了沉默的昆仑山。
    这里过去没有人烟，除了广漠的沙石荒滩以外，就是光秃秃的高山，曾经有人用“山上不飞鸟，地上不长草”来形容它的荒凉。自从在这里修建水电站以来，才开始飘起了缕缕炊烟，有了生活的气息。然而我们的工人们，就是在这样的环境下，也生活得愉快而有生气。
    这里除了帐篷以外，连一幢临时房屋也没有。带有家属的职工，为了解决住房问题，利用业余时间，在地下挖了一个个的坑，上面盖上篷布和席子，就成了一间间的
  “地下室”。为了区别户名，大家挨户的编了号，用木牌标了出来，一个挨一个，连续好几百米，人们含笑地称它为“家属大街”和“地下宫殿”。工人们说这比楼房还带劲，既避风，又暖和。
    工人们把运来的砖堆成一个长方形，盖上几块篷布，风一刮就哗啦哗啦响，里面除了零乱地堆着一些砖头以外，空洞洞的没有一张桌子，一条凳子，光线从砖窟窿里透进来——这就是他们唯一的“电影院”。乐观的工人们，还在进口处竖了一个木牌子，用红字蓝边规规矩矩写了几个字：昆仑电影院。
    我们还看到工人们自己开辟的篮球场，篮球架是用一根杉杆栽在地下，上面钉了一个铁圈圈做成的。有个同志笑着对工地负责同志说：“这篮球架很有意思，不过，要是能在上面钉上一些木板，那就更好了，难道你们连这几块木板也没有？”工地负责同志兴奋地回答说：“木板倒是有，但这些木板都是从遥远的内地和西藏运来的，工人们舍不得用它。”在这里，工人们对于一颗螺丝钉，一小块木板，都是很珍惜的，你经常可以在工地发现，有的工人同志，不脱鞋袜奋不顾身地跳到刺骨的雪水河里去抢救一根被水冲走的木头或是一个竹簸箕。我们工人自己造的“地下宫殿”、“电影院”、球场，没有花国家一分钱……
    这时，已是黄昏时候，火红的晚霞，给屏风似的昆仑山，镀上了一层金色的光采。忽然，从“地下宫殿”和帐篷里传来粗犷的笑声和悠扬的胡琴、横笛的吹奏声。这轻快的乐声，把高原上建设英雄们的喜悦的心情，沿着昆仑山和昆仑河，散向祖国的四面八方……
