Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch: The Communist International Collective Farm in the Michurinsk District of Tambov Oblast, Soviet Union, has overfulfilled its 1957 meat production target one year ahead of schedule, increasing meat production forty-fold compared to 1953 this year. To this end, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union recently issued a congratulatory letter, expressing warm congratulations. The congratulatory letter pointed out that the Communist International Collective Farm's initiative in increasing meat production is of particularly great significance to all agricultural workers in the Soviet Union.

Prior to 1953, livestock production at the Communist International Collective Farm was very underdeveloped. In that year, it produced an average of only four quintals of meat per hundred hectares of agricultural land. In order to quickly change this backward situation, two years ago, the collective farm proposed to strive to produce an average of 170 quintals of meat per hundred hectares of agricultural land by 1960. As of early December this year, it had produced an average of 171 quintals of meat per hundred hectares of agricultural land. This means that the original target has not only been completed one year ahead of schedule, but has also been overfulfilled.

The Communist International Collective Farm has been able to increase meat production so rapidly due to strengthening the Party's leadership over production. At the same time, all members of the farm have actively worked to increase feed production and improve livestock feeding methods.

    苏联共产国际集体农庄
    六年来肉类增产四十倍
    据新华社莫斯科电　苏联坦波夫州米丘林区的共产国际集体农庄提前一年超额完成了它在1957年提出的肉类生产任务，在今年把肉类生产比1953年增加了四十倍。为此，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议日前曾发出贺信，表示热烈祝贺。贺信中指出、共产国际集体农庄在增加肉类生产方面的创举对苏联全体农业劳动者具有特别重大的意义。
    1953年以前，共产国际集体农庄的畜牧业生产很不发达，这一年，它平均在每一百公顷农业用地上只生产了四公担肉类。为了迅速改变这种落后状况，两年前，这个集体农庄提出，要争取在1960年使每一百公顷农业用地平均生产一百七十公担肉类。而到今年12月初，它平均已在每一百公顷农业用地上生产了一百七十一公担肉类。这就是说，原订目标不但已提前一年完成，并且超额完成了。
    共产国际集体农庄之所以能够如此迅速地使肉类生产增加，是由于加强了党对生产的领导，同时，全体庄员们积极努力增加了饲料的生产，并改善了牲畜的饲养方法。
