　　The Treatment of Book Diseases

　　A book is composed of many materials such as paper, ink, cardboard, cover cloth, binding thread, wire, and glue. Just like the human body, if any part becomes ill, that is, if the physical and chemical properties or mechanical properties of any of these materials change, the book will decay. For example, if the paper loses its mechanical strength, it becomes easily broken; the ink fades and becomes unreadable; the bookbinding staples rust and break, and so on. Therefore, if we want to make books "immortal," we must prevent and treat book diseases.

　　Books are afraid of the ultraviolet and violet rays of sunlight, because they can destroy the fiber structure of the paper. Therefore, the bookshelf or bookcase should be placed perpendicular to the window, and the bookcase should be fitted with glass that diffuses and filters light (i.e., frosted glass or glass coated with yellow paint). Books are afraid of dust, because it absorbs insect eggs and mold spores from the air, causing the book to become infested with insects and mold. Therefore, the room and bookshelves should be cleaned regularly, and the dust on the books should be wiped off. Books are afraid of air that is too humid, because excessively humid air will cause the pages to stick together and the words to fade, and it will also cause the books to mold and rot. Therefore, do not put books in damp rooms, and the indoor air should be changed frequently. These are all methods for preventing book diseases.

　　The staff of libraries and archives are very worried about books that have become diseased and whose words have faded. Just like doctors who actively research new therapies to relieve patients' suffering, they have researched various methods to treat books. The staff of the Lenin Library in the Soviet Union soaked a manuscript written on parchment more than a thousand years ago, whose ink had become illegible, with tannic acid. The text reappeared and became as good as new, as if it had just been written on paper. Italians soaked books in vitamins B2 and B12 and found that the books, like people, immediately "made a miraculous recovery" after receiving vitamins.

　　The therapeutics of books will certainly become richer day by day with the rapid development of science, and the methods of treating book diseases will become more and more numerous and effective.

　　书病的治疗
    一本书刊是由纸、油墨、硬板纸、封面布、装钉线、铁丝、胶等许多物质组成，正如人的身体一样，不管哪一部分患了病，也就是不论哪一种物质的理化性能与机械性能发生了变化，书刊就要腐坏。如：纸丧失了机械坚韧性就变得易折断，油墨字会褪色而看不清；装书钉会生锈而折断，等等。因此，要想使书刊“长生不老”就必须对书病加以预防和治疗。
    书怕太阳光的紫外线和紫线，因为它能破坏纸的纤维组织，因此需要把书架或书橱放在垂直于窗口的位置，并且应该在书橱上装有散光和滤光作用的玻璃（也就是毛玻璃或涂有黄颜色的玻璃）。书怕灰尘，因为它会吸收空气中的虫卵和霉菌孢子使书生虫、发霉，所以应该经常打扫房间和书架，拭净书上灰尘。书怕空气太潮，因为过潮的空气会使书页粘合起来，并且使字褪色，也会使书生霉、腐烂，因此不要把书放在潮湿的房间里，室内应常换空气，这些都是关于预防书病的方法。
    图书馆和档案库的工作人员对已经生病而文字褪色的书非常伤脑筋，他们就像医生积极研究新疗法来替病人解除痛苦一样，研究出种种方法给书治病。苏联列宁图书馆的工作人员对一本一千多年前写在羊皮纸上如今墨迹已看不清的手稿，用鞣酸浸透，文字重复出现而变得像不久以前刚写在纸上那样焕然一新。意大利人把维生素B2和B12浸泡书刊，发现书像人一样得到维生素后立即“妙手回春”。
    书的治疗学随着科学一日千里的发展肯定会一天比一天更丰富起来，治疗书病的办法也会愈来愈多和有效
