Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of Anhui Province have waged a hundred days of arduous struggle against the severe drought and have now achieved a great victory. Of the 86,050,000 mu of autumn harvest crops in the province, 54,010,000 mu were affected by drought. With the exception of 21,870,000 mu which suffered varying degrees of reduced production due to lack of water sources, the remaining 64,180,000 mu all increased production compared to last year or maintained production. This year, the total grain output of the province still increased compared to last year, and the increase in cotton output was even greater than last year.

    The characteristics of this year's drought in Anhui Province are that the affected area is wide, the duration is long, and the degree is severe. The drought-affected area in the province reached 64 counties, with an affected area of 54,010,000 mu. From June 20 to October 26, the average rainfall in the province was only 293.5 mm, which was 234 mm less than the rainfall in the same period in previous years. Especially in July and August, when various crops were in the critical period of flowering and fruiting and required the most water, there was basically no rain in the province. By the end of August and the beginning of September, there was some rain in the province, but because the rainfall was not heavy and the area was not widespread, the drought was still not completely relieved. It was not until the end of October and the beginning of November that there was widespread rain in various parts of the province, relieving the drought. Under such severe drought conditions, the province still achieved a bumper harvest, which is a stark contrast to the drought years in history. In 1934, the most severe drought year in Anhui's history, there was no rain for about two months, and the affected area was only 37 million mu. Whether it was the duration, area, or severity of the drought, it was far less severe than this year. However, at that time, 18,160,000 mu of land in the province yielded nothing, and the number of disaster victims reached 8,710,000, accounting for 38% of the total population at that time.

    Anhui Province made early preparations for drought prevention and drought resistance this year. When there was more spring rain, the Provincial Party Committee promptly instructed all localities to store a large amount of water, filling reservoirs, ponds, and rice fields with water. When the drought first appeared, all localities vigorously grasped the drought resistance struggle. Later, with the development of the drought, a vigorous mass drought resistance struggle was quickly launched throughout the province. During the drought resistance period, the province built a total of 180,000 river dams, deepened 150,000 ditches and ponds, opened 410,000 diversion canals, dug 1,180,000 earthen wells, and searched for 180,000 springs. During the drought resistance period, Party secretaries at all levels personally took charge and directed operations. More than 350,000 cadres at all levels in the province participated in the drought resistance battle.

    In this year's drought resistance in Anhui Province, the water conservancy projects built over the years, especially the river network project, played a huge role. In Huaibei, 24,800,000 mu of land were irrigated with water from the river network. The 5 million mu of rice fields that were converted to rice cultivation this year in the Huaibei area, where the river network has been realized, still achieved a bumper harvest even without rain for 80 to 100 days. Small-scale water conservancy projects in various places have also played a huge role in drought resistance. The water in the 97 small reservoirs in Feixi County was not used up.

    The People's Commune demonstrated unparalleled power in drought resistance. Under the organization and leadership of the People's Commune, extensive cooperation was carried out in terms of water sources, labor, and tools, greatly accelerating the progress of drought resistance and generally improving drought resistance capabilities. For example, nine well-conditioned brigades of the Yanggong Commune in Shouxian County drew more than 1,000 people, carrying 180 waterwheels and more than 1,500 small water-lifting tools, and rushed to support three less well-conditioned brigades. In ten days, they rescued more than 5,000 mu of drought-affected crops in a timely manner. If cooperation had not been carried out, the three brigades could only have rescued about 1,500 mu. The Guanyi Commune in Feixi County made unified arrangements for water sources throughout the commune, adjusted the irrigation system according to the terrain, and fully utilized the existing reservoirs and large dams. The irrigation area of ​​five reservoirs, including Tongwa, expanded from 15,000 mu to more than 20,000 mu.

    In the drought resistance struggle, the province timely irrigated 46,230,000 mu of drought-affected arable land, accounting for 85% of the total drought-affected area, thus ensuring a bumper harvest in a year of severe drought.

### 人民公社力量大  水利工程效益宏  安徽抗旱百天粮棉增产　全省八千多万亩秋收作物中，有五千多万亩受旱，除二千多万亩减产外，其余六千多万亩增产或保产

　　安徽抗旱百天粮棉增产
　　全省八千多万亩秋收作物中，有五千多万亩受旱，除二千多万亩减产外，其余六千多万亩增产或保产
    据新华社合肥19日电　安徽省人民在党的领导下，同严重的干旱进行了一百多天的艰苦斗争，现已取得巨大胜利。全省八千六百零五万亩秋收作物中受旱的有五千四百零一万亩，除二千一百八十七万亩由于缺乏水源有不同程度的减产外，其余六千四百一十八万亩都比去年增产或做到了保产。今年全省粮食总产量仍比去年增产，棉花产量比去年增产幅度更大。
    安徽省今年干旱的特点是受旱面积广、时间长、程度严重。全省受旱地区达六十四个县，受旱面积有五千四百零一万亩。从6月20日到10月26日，全省平均降雨量只有二百九十三点五毫米，比往年同期雨量少二百三十四毫米。特别是7、8两个月，当各种农作物正开花结实、需水最多的紧要关头，全省基本上没有下雨。到8月底9月初，全省才下了一些雨，但是由于雨量不大，而且地区不普遍，旱象仍然没有全部解除。一直到10月底11月初，全省各地才普遍下雨，解除了旱象。在这样严重干旱的情况下，全省仍然获得了丰收，与历史上干旱年是个鲜明的对比。1934年是安徽历史上最严重的旱年，两个月左右没有下雨，受旱的面积只有三千七百万亩，不论受旱的时间、面积、或是受旱的程度，都远远不如今年这样严重。但当时全省颗粒无收的有一千八百一十六万亩，灾民达八百七十一万人，占当时总人口的38％。
    安徽省今年的防旱抗旱工作准备得很早，在春雨较多的时候，省委就及时指示各地大量蓄水，将水库、水塘、稻田都灌满了水。当旱象一露头，各地就大力抓抗旱斗争。以后随着旱情的发展，很快在全省掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性抗旱斗争高潮。在抗旱期中，全省共打拦河坝十八万处，挖深沟塘十五万处，开引水渠四十一万条，打土井一百一十八万眼，下泉找泉十八万眼。在抗旱期中，各级党委书记都亲自挂帅，指挥作战。全省参加抗旱战斗的各级干部达三十五万多人。
    安徽省在今年抗旱中，历年来兴修的水利工程，特别是河网化工程起了极大的作用。淮北用河网里的水灌溉的土地达二千四百八十万亩。淮北地区已经实现河网化的地方今年改种的五百万亩水稻，在八十天到一百天不下雨的情况下，仍然获得了丰收。各地的小型水利工程在抗旱中也发挥了巨大的作用。肥西县九十七个小水库的水都没有用完。
    人民公社在抗旱中显示了无比的威力。在人民公社组织领导下，广泛地开展了水源、劳力、工具等方面的大协作，大大加快了抗旱的进度，普遍提高了抗旱的能力。如寿县阳公公社条件较好的九个大队在抗旱中抽出一千多人，携带一百八十部水车和一千五百多件小型提水工具，赶到三个条件较差的大队去支援，十天中就及时抢救了五千多亩受旱作物，如果不开展协作，三个大队只能抢救一千五百亩左右。肥西县馆驿公社在全社统一安排水源，按照地形调整灌溉系统，充分发挥了现有水库和大塘坝的作用，童洼等五个水库的灌溉区由一万五千亩扩大到二万多亩。
    在抗旱斗争中，全省及时浇灌了受旱耕地四千六百二十三万亩，占全部受旱面积的85％，因而保证了在大旱之年仍然获得了丰收。
