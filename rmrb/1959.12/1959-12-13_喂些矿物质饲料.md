In the winter and spring, pigs cannot graze, eat green grass, or get enough sun exposure. The feed is relatively simple, and pigs, especially piglets, are prone to lacking certain minerals in their bodies. Pigs lacking minerals may lightly exhibit behaviors such as drinking urine, rooting in manure, gnawing at feed troughs, and eating soil; severely affected pigs may develop lameness, lie on the ground, shiver all over, and have convulsions. To prevent this, bone meal or lime powder, eggshells, and precipitated calcium carbonate should be added to the feed regularly. You can also place wood charcoal powder, chalky soil, and red clay, as well as trace amounts of copper sulfate and ferrous sulfate, in the pen for them to eat freely. Regularly feeding salt and silage, allowing appropriate exercise, and getting more sun exposure can also prevent this situation.

    喂些矿物质饲料
    冬春两季，猪得不到放牧，吃不上青草，不能很好晒太阳，喂的饲料比较单纯，猪，特别是小猪很容易使体内缺乏某些矿物质。缺乏矿物质的猪，轻的爱喝尿、拱粪、啃饲槽、啃泥土等；重的发生腿跛、卧地、浑身打寒战、抽筋。为了防止这种情况发生，平时在饲料内应加入骨粉或石灰粉、鸡蛋壳、沉淀炭酸钙。也可以在圈内放置有木炭末、白垩土和红粘土以及微量的硫酸铜、硫酸铁，任其采食。常喂食盐、青贮饲料，让它适当运动，多晒太阳，也可以防止这种情况发生。
