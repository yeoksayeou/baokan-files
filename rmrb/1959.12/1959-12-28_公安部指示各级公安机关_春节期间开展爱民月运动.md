Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: The Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China recently issued instructions to public security organs at all levels regarding the launch of a "Love the People Month" campaign within the public security system during the 1960 Spring Festival.

The instructions pointed out that public security organs at all levels launched a "Love the People Month" campaign during the 1959 Spring Festival, which achieved remarkable results. During the campaign, public security personnel in various regions did more than four million good deeds for the masses, and many models of loving the people and moving deeds of self-sacrifice emerged. The masses also loved the public security personnel and supported public security work even more. Actual circumstances show that the "Love the People Month" campaign is a very good way to strengthen the ties between public security organs and the people and promote the mass line in public security work.

The instructions required public security organs in various regions to carry out the "Love the People Month" campaign more deeply and extensively during the 1960 Spring Festival. This movement should be popularized to every corner. During the "Love the People Month" campaign, public security organs in various regions should fully mobilize the masses, carry out extensive mass propaganda activities, greatly commend good people and good deeds, and at the same time do a great deal of good things for the masses during the campaign. The instructions pointed out that in the 1960 "Love the People Month" campaign, good deeds should be closely integrated with the current socialist production and construction, such as winter plowing and fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy construction, short-distance transportation, afforestation and road construction, and good deeds should be closely integrated with various public security and defense work. After the "Love the People Month" campaign, we must continue to uphold the glorious tradition of doing good deeds for the masses.

    新华社27日讯　中华人民共和国公安部最近向各级公安机关发出了关于1960年春节期间在公安系统内开展爱民月运动的指示。
    指示指出，1959年春节期间各级公安机关开展了爱民月运动，取得了显著成绩。运动中各地公安人员共为群众办好事四百多万件，涌现出许多爱民模范和舍己救人的动人事迹。群众也更加热爱公安人员和支持公安工作。实际情况表明，爱民月运动是密切公安机关同人民群众的联系，推动公安工作大走群众路线的一个很好的形式。
    指示要求各地公安机关，在1960年春节期间，要更加深入、更加广泛地开展爱民月运动。要把这次运动普及到各个角落。各地公安机关在爱民月运动中，要充分发动群众，大搞群众宣传活动，大大表扬好人好事，同时在运动中要为群众大办好事。指示指出，在1960年的爱民月运动中，应当紧密结合当前的社会主义生产建设，例如冬耕积肥、兴修水利、短途运输、造林筑路等去办好事，紧密结合各项治安保卫工作去办好事。在爱民月运动以后，还要把为群众办好事的光荣传统，经常地坚持下去。
