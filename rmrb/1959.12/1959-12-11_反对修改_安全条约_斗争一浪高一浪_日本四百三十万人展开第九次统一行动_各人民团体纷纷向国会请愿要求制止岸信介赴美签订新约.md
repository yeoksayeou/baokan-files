Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th -- News: Four million three hundred thousand Japanese people launched a massive ninth unified action in 750 locations across the country today, resolutely opposing the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" by the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke government.

Participating in the unified action were people from all walks of life, including workers, farmers, students, cultural figures, and ordinary citizens, who launched a struggle against the "Security Treaty" in various forms such as strikes, rallies, demonstrations, and petitions to the National Diet.

A spokesperson for the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" pointed out that the scale of the ninth unified action is the largest mass action in recent times.

The focus of the ninth unified action was the struggle by the working class at their posts. National railway workers held workplace rallies. Coal miners launched a 24-hour strike. Unions in most private enterprises, such as private railways, steel, metal, chemicals, printing, and temporary workers, held several-hour strikes and workplace meetings. Postal workers held workplace meetings at 138 post offices nationwide. Teachers stopped teaching for several hours.

In Tokyo, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Employees' Union Council held a rally of 50,000 workers, opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty" and demanding increased wages. Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, Iwama Masao, member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and others spoke at the rally. The rally passed a resolution demanding that the government immediately halt negotiations on the revision of the "Security Treaty." After the meeting, participants marched in three columns in downtown Tokyo.

In addition, 10,000 students held a rally in Tokyo to protest the revision of the "Security Treaty." Student representatives from five prefectures, including Hokkaido and Gunma, came to Tokyo to participate in the rally.

After the meeting, the students held a demonstration in the streets. They shouted slogans: "Oppose the revision of the 'Security Treaty'," "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke government," "Don't sell the blood of youth to U.S. imperialism," "We don't want to die for the United States."

The Kishi Nobusuke government dispatched thousands of armed police in Tokyo for "guard duty."

In Osaka, workers in national railways, postal departments, and municipal governments, as well as teachers, and workers in private railways, steel, synthetic chemicals, and hardware enterprises held strikes or workplace meetings during working hours. In the afternoon, a total of about 23,000 workers, intellectuals, women, and other people from all walks of life held a rally against the revision of the "Security Treaty." This rally, attended by representatives from 60 groups, passed seven resolutions demanding the immediate cessation of negotiations on the revision of the "Security Treaty" and opposing the conspiracy to ban demonstrations near the National Diet.

The unified action not only took place in large cities such as Kyoto and Nagoya, but also spread to remote areas such as Hokkaido and Kyushu. In Kyushu—Japan's coal mining area—41 mine unions held a 24-hour strike together. In Omuta City, the site of the most intense struggle by Kyushu coal miners against layoffs, 15,000 people from all walks of life held a rally. The rally issued a declaration opposing the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and passed a resolution against unemployment. Participants in the rally also held a demonstration with 4,000 torches and lanterns. Four thousand people in Fukuoka City also held a mass rally and lantern parade against the "Security Treaty."

    另外，一万名学生在东京举行大会，抗议修改“安全条约”。来自包括北海道和群马等五个县的学生代表来到东京参加了这个大会。
    会后，学生们在大街上举行了示威游行。他们高呼口号：“反对修改‘安全条约’”，“打倒岸信介政府”，“不要把青年的鲜血出卖给美帝国主义”，“我们不愿为美国送死”。
    岸信介政府在东京出动成千名武装警察“戒备”。
