Shanghai Railway Bureau Achieves Double Success in Passenger and Freight Transport

　　This newspaper reports that the Shanghai Railway Bureau had already overfulfilled the state-assigned freight transport task by 15 days on the 16th. The freight volume increased by 72.7% compared with the same period last year. The bureau's passenger transport task was completed 68 days ahead of schedule, and it has now transported more than 6 million additional passengers, an increase of 36.3% compared with the same period last year.

　　While achieving double success in passenger and freight transport, the main quality indicators have also improved significantly compared to last year. The static load reached 42.6 tons, an increase of 4.5 tons compared with the same period last year, of which more than 2.5 million tons were completed by way of mixed or "piggyback" transport, an increase of more than 200 times compared with last year. The vehicle turnaround time has been shortened to 1.59 days, a decrease of 0.14 days compared with the same period last year. Other indicators, such as average traction tonnage and daily output, have also greatly improved compared to last year's actual performance. Due to the continuous improvement of various key indicators, compared with last year's actual results, more than 338,000 vehicle trips have been saved.

　　Under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, the Party Committee of the Shanghai Railway Bureau mobilized the masses and did a lot of work to complete this year's heavy transportation tasks. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, after the struggle against right-leaning tendencies, a new upsurge of mass-based production increase and economy drive was even more surging, and the red flag competitions on all fronts were in full swing. In the competition, technical innovation and technical revolution were vigorously carried out, and the employees of the entire bureau strived to advance toward the "Four Modernizations" (mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, overhaul, road and bridge maintenance, and construction), achieving tremendous results. Up to now, mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading have accounted for 30.9% of the total workload; mechanization and semi-mechanization of locomotive overhaul have accounted for 80% of the total workload; mechanization and semi-mechanization of vehicle overhaul have reached 65%; mechanization and semi-mechanization of road maintenance have accounted for 54.4% of the total workload; mechanization and semi-mechanization of bridge maintenance account for more than 50%. In terms of semi-mechanization of construction, 2,969 labor vehicles and 26 tamping machines have been added this year. All of these have further reduced the labor intensity of workers and improved labor productivity. The bureau has also vigorously promoted a style of cooperation from within the railway to outside the railway, and has obtained assistance and support from all aspects. (Attached picture)

　　跃进列车高速驶入1960年
    上海铁路总局客运货运双双奏捷
    本报讯　上海铁路总局已经在16日提前十五天完成了国家规定的货运任务，货运量比去年同期增长72.7％。这个局的客运任务已提前六十八天完成，现又超额运送了六百多万人，比去年同期增长36.3％。
    在客货运输双双奏捷的同时，主要质量指标也比去年提高很多。静载重达到四十二点六吨，比去年同期提高四点五吨，其中捎脚运输完成二百五十余万吨，比去年增加二百多倍。车辆周转时间缩短到一点五九天，比去年同期缩短零点一四天。其他如平牵、日产等指标，实际成绩也比去年大大提高。由于各项主要指标不断提高，与去年实绩比较，就节约了运用车三十三万八千余辆。
    上海铁路总局党委在上级党委的领导下，发动群众，为完成今年繁重的运输任务做了很多工作。特别是党的八届八中全会后，经过反右倾的斗争，群众性的增产节约新高潮更加汹涌澎湃，各条战线上的红旗竞赛如火如荼。在竞赛中，大闹技术革新和技术革命，全局职工奋力向“四化”（装卸、检修、养路养桥、施工机械化和半机械化）大进军，取得了巨大的成绩。到目前为止，装卸机械化、半机械化已占总作业量的30.9％；机车检修机械化、半机械化已占总工作量的80％；车辆检修机械化、半机械化已达65％；养路机械化、半机械化已占总作业量的54.4％；养桥机械化、半机械化占50％以上。在施工半机械化方面，今年又增添二千九百六十九辆劳动车和二十六套捣固机。所有这些，都进一步减轻了工人的劳动强度，提高了劳动生产率。这个局还从路内到路外大兴协作之风，取得了各方面的协助和支援。（附图片）
