    Resolutely Oppose Right-Leaning Thought, Defend the Party's Literary and Art Policy
    Zhang Junxiang
    After liberation, the Party regarded film art as one of the powerful weapons for propaganda and education, and the film industry has developed rapidly by leaps and bounds. Under the education and care of the Party, and after a series of political movements, as well as the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun", the rectification movement in literary and art circles, the study of the anti-Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and the study of socialist realism creation methods, the vast majority of film workers have made great progress in their political and ideological thinking and creative thinking. However, since many film workers came from the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, the bourgeois worldview and literary and artistic viewpoints are deeply rooted in the minds of some film workers. Therefore, when the rightists in 1957 beat the so-called "film gongs and drums" and frantically attacked the Party, negating the Party's leadership over the film industry, opposing the Party's policy of serving workers, peasants and soldiers in literature and art, and attempting to drag the film industry back to the old road of capitalism, some creative personnel were shaken to varying degrees, and even lost their way on certain issues.
    The anti-Rightist struggle is like a mirror. Many creative personnel saw these erroneous things in their thinking and aroused the vigilance of the vast majority of people, who urgently demanded to be freed from the shackles of these bourgeois ideological viewpoints as soon as possible. In 1958, under the strong leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, Shanghai's film studios launched a rectification movement, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, making great breakthroughs. In response to the serious phenomena of creative personnel being divorced from politics, reality, and the masses, it was proposed that creation must put politics in command, creative personnel must go deep into life, and the mass line must be followed in the creative process. At the same time, specific and effective measures were taken to organize creative personnel to go to factories and the countryside, and a group of documentary art films reflecting the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1958 were quickly created and filmed. Taking the two feature film studios as an example, in just six months in the second half of 1958, they produced thirty-three documentary art films. These films reflected the Great Leap Forward, the current political struggle, and the communist style embodied by the working class and the broad masses of working people in actual struggle, and therefore had high ideological value. Because the film staff went to factories and the countryside and came into contact with workers and peasants, the situation where actors playing workers did not look like workers and actors playing peasants did not look like peasants began to change, and they started to resemble them a bit. However, the more significant gain was that the creative personnel were infected by the soaring enthusiasm and high morale of the workers and peasants, and were excited by their ever-changing labor achievements, thus inspiring the enthusiasm to reflect workers and peasants, and to praise workers and peasants; they began to be dissatisfied with their past creative thinking and creative methods, and demanded to break with them, demanding to find new methods of expression and establish new styles; at the same time, they also began to truly realize that only by going deep into life, sharing weal and woe with the broad masses of working people, and earnestly transforming their thinking and improving their political awareness, can these problems be solved.
    We must have a sufficient estimate of the achievements of 1958, and we must see the role and influence of the practice of 1958 on the thinking of creative personnel. This role and influence is far-reaching. As long as we persevere, the face of film workers will progress with each passing day, and the film industry will become more prosperous and developed.
    However, has bourgeois literary and artistic thought been completely eliminated from our film staff? Is it that we can now relax and no longer need to fight against right-leaning thought? Absolutely not! Such a view is not only inconsistent with the facts, but also dangerous. The facts show that right-leaning thought and right-leaning literary and artistic viewpoints among film workers have not been completely eliminated, and have shown varying degrees of resurgence in 1959. Aren't there people emphasizing artistic laws again, shouting about "the director having supreme power in art," intentionally or unintentionally negating the Party's leadership over art and negating putting politics in command? Aren't there people unilaterally and isolatedly emphasizing quality, attempting to take the road of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive"? Aren't there people doubting whether film creation and film production can follow the mass line? Aren't there people intentionally or unintentionally underestimating the achievements of 1958, falsely claiming that grasping politics meant losing art?
    We must wage an uncompromising struggle against these right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning literary and artistic viewpoints, we must summarize and accept the good experiences of 1958, overcome some shortcomings in the work process with full confidence, and move forward in big strides; we must adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to the mass line, and adhere to doing more, faster, better, and more economically. This is a struggle between two roads. Compromising with right-leaning thought and right-leaning literary and artistic viewpoints, and abandoning the struggle, will inevitably mean abandoning the progress we have made in ten years, and returning to the old, dead, and hopeless road of bourgeois literary and artistic thought. Shanghai's film workers are determined to make a complete break with bourgeois literary and artistic thought, and resolutely take the correct, healthy, and broad road pointed out by the Party. Because only in this way can we truly let a hundred flowers bloom in the film garden, and achieve the goal of serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and serving socialism. And only in this way can we truly unite and strengthen our ranks. The experience of the past ten years has proven this, and the double harvest of film thought and production in 1958 has also proven this. The achievements of Shanghai's studios in this year's National Day film exhibition month further prove this. Taking the eight feature films as an example, they not only reflect the major themes of the current reality struggle, but also have very broad themes and very rich styles: there are industry, agriculture, children's lives, minority themes, historical biography films, musical films, dance films... It is particularly gratifying that several films take outstanding children of the Party as protagonists, and have more successfully shaped the image of Party members: Zhan Changhe in "The Veteran's New Story," and Fang Qun, the hospital Party committee secretary in "Spring Fills the World," and others. It should be admitted that although these films still have this or that shortcoming and deficiency in terms of ideological height and artistic treatment, generally speaking, they have broken through the past level. It is hard to imagine that without the foundation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, so many films with relatively good ideological, artistic, and technical levels could have been made simultaneously in such a short period of time. It is even harder to imagine that without ten years of the Party's meticulous and patient political and ideological education, today's achievements could have been obtained, and today's level could have been reached.
    We must never be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. It should be admitted that we are still very inadequate in all aspects. Due to our low political level, we are not good at grasping the essence of things and the main contradictions in life, so in our creations we often either commit the fault of formalism and conceptualization, or commit the fault of naturalism. Because of the lack of perceptual knowledge of the lives of workers and peasants, and not being familiar with their thoughts, feelings and language, our works are often either boring and tasteless, or wrongly indulge in the vulgar tastes of the bourgeois and petty bourgeoisie, and the result of being divorced from politics and life often makes us blind to the major changes of the current era, and we do not deeply feel the experience and achievements of the Party in applying Marxism-Leninism in the actual struggle of revolution and construction, and therefore we cannot enthusiastically and skillfully reflect these themes, which should have been the most important in film. For example, the people's commune movement, like the rising sun, has not yet been reflected on the screen, and there is no script that well introduces the rich experience of education serving proletarian politics and the integration of education and productive labor. Finally, our professional skills are also still very inadequate, and are even uneven. We have not studied enough, from general literary and artistic cultivation and aesthetic theory to the special laws of film, and we also lack research on national traditional forms. The ideology, artistry, and style of our works still need to be further improved. Therefore, we have no reason to be proud and complacent, or to be slack and relaxed. We must strive to overcome these shortcomings and forge ahead bravely.
    We have absolute confidence because we have the guidance of our beloved Party. As long as we listen to the Party, resolutely follow the Party's literary and art direction, implement the Party's literary and art policy, study hard, go deep into life, transform our worldview, wage an uncompromising struggle against right-leaning thought, and exert our efforts to continue the leap forward, we will surely achieve greater victories on the basis of victory.

    坚决反掉右倾思想，保卫党的文艺方针
    张骏祥
    解放后，党把电影艺术作为宣传教育的有力武器之一，电影事业一日千里飞速发展。广大电影工作者在党的教育与关怀下，经过一系列的政治运动，又经过影片“武训传”的批判，文艺整风，反对胡风反革命集团的学习与社会主义现实主义创作方法的学习，绝大多数电影工作者在政治思想上和创作思想上都有了很大的进步。但是，由于不少电影工作者出身于资产阶级和小资产阶级，资产阶级的世界观和文艺观点在某些电影工作者的头脑里是根深蒂固的。因此，当1957年右派分子敲起所谓
  “电影的锣鼓”，向党猖狂进攻，否定党对电影事业的领导，反对党的文艺为工农兵服务的方针，企图把电影事业拉回资本主义的老路上去的时候，有些创作人员在不同程度上发生了动摇，以至在某些问题上迷失了方向。
    反右派斗争像一面镜子一样，不少创作人员从中照见了自己思想上的这些错误的东西，引起了绝大多数人的警惕，迫切要求尽快从这些资产阶级的思想观点的束缚中解放出来。1958年，上海各电影制片厂在市委的坚强领导下，又开展了整风运动，兴无灭资，大破大立。针对着创作人员严重的脱离政治脱离实际脱离群众的现象，提出了创作必须政治挂帅，创作人员必须深入生活，创作过程中必须走群众路线。同时采取了具体有效的措施，组织创作人员下厂下乡，很快地创作并摄制了一批反映1958年工农业大跃进的纪录性艺术片。以两个故事片厂为例，仅仅在1958年下半年六个月的时间内，就摄制了三十三部纪录性艺术片。这些影片反映了大跃进，反映了当前的政治斗争，表现了工人阶级与广大劳动人民在实际斗争中体现出来的共产主义风格，因此具有较高的思想性。由于电影工作人员下了厂下了乡，接触了工人农民，过去演工人不像工人、演农民不像农民的情况开始扭转了，有点像了。但是，更重大的收获还在于：创作人员为工人农民的冲天干劲和昂扬的斗志所感染，为他们的日新月异的劳动成果所激动，因而激发了反映工农、歌颂工农的热情；开始不满意自己过去的创作思想与创作方法，并要求与之决裂，要求找寻新的表现方法与树立新的风格；同时，也开始真正体会到只有深入生活，与广大劳动人民同甘苦、共呼吸，认真地改造自己的思想，提高政治觉悟，才能够解决这些问题。
    我们必须对1958年的成绩有足够的估计，更必须看到1958年的做法在创作人员的思想上所起的作用与影响。这个作用与影响是深远的，只要坚持下去，电影工作者的面貌，就会日新月异地进步，电影事业就会更加繁荣发展。
    但是，是不是资产阶级文艺思想已经在我们的电影工作人员中彻底肃清了呢？是不是从此就风平浪静、不再需要和右倾思想作斗争了呢？决不是的！那样的看法不但是不符合事实，而且是危险的。事实说明，电影工作者中的右倾思想和右倾文艺观点并未彻底消灭，而且在1959年又有了不同程度的抬头。不是又有人在强调艺术规律，喊什么“艺术大权归导演”，有意无意地否定党对艺术的领导，否定政治挂帅吗？不是又有人在片面地孤立地强调质量，企图走少慢差费的回头路吗？不是有人怀疑电影创作、电影生产能否走群众路线吗？不是又有人有意无意地低估1958年的成绩，诬蔑说是抓了政治丢了艺术吗？
    我们必须对这些右倾思想右倾文艺观点作不妥协的斗争，必须总结接受1958年的好经验，信心十足地克服一些工作过程中的缺点，大踏步前进；必须坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，坚持多快好省。这是两条道路的斗争。对右倾思想右倾文艺观点妥协，放弃斗争，就必然是抛弃我们十年所取得的进步，退回资产阶级文艺思想老路、死路、绝路。上海的电影工作者决心与资产阶级文艺思想作彻底决裂，坚决走党所指引的正确的健康的宽广的道路。因为只有这样，我们才能使电影园地中真正百花齐放，达到为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的目的。也只有这样，我们才能真正团结与壮大自己的队伍。十年来的经验证明这一点，1958年的电影思想生产双丰收也证明这一点。今年庆祝建国十周年影片展览月上海各厂的影片的成就更证明这一点。就以八部故事片来说，不但反映了当前现实斗争的重大题材，而题材又十分广阔，样式也十分丰富：有工业，有农业，有儿童生活，有少数民族题材，有历史传记片，有音乐片，有舞蹈片……特别可喜的是，有好几部影片是以党的优秀儿女为主角，比较成功地塑造了党员的形象：“老兵新传”中的战长河、“春满人间”里的医院党委书记方群等。应该承认，这些影片尽管在思想高度上和艺术处理上还存在着这样那样的缺点和不足，一般说来，是突破了过去的水平的。很难设想，没有1958年大跃进的基础，能在短短的时期内同时摄成这样多思想、艺术、技术水平都比较好的影片。更难设想，没有十年来党的细致的耐心的政治思想教育，能够获得今天的成就，达到今天这样的水平。
    我们绝不能满足于已经取得的成就。应该承认，我们在各方面都还是很不够的。由于政治水平不高，我们还不善于抓事物的本质和生活中的主要矛盾，因而在创作中常常不是犯公式主义、概念化的毛病就是犯自然主义的毛病。由于缺乏工农群众的生活的感性知识，不熟悉他们的思想感情和语言，因此作品常常不是枯燥乏味就是错误地搬弄资产阶级小资产阶级的庸俗趣味，而脱离政治脱离生活的结果，更常常使我们对于当前的重大变化熟视无睹，对党在革命和建设的实际斗争中运用马克思列宁主义的经验与成果感受不深，因而不能热情洋溢地、得心应手地反映这些本来应该是电影最主要的题材。例如像旭日东升一般的人民公社运动到今天还没有在银幕上得到反映，也还没有一个剧本很好地介绍教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的丰富经验。最后，我们的业务能力也还很不到家，更是参差不齐，从一般文艺修养美学理论到电影的特殊规律都钻研不足，对民族的传统形式也缺乏研究。我们作品的思想性、艺术性、作品的风格都还需要作更进一步的提高。因此我们没有任何理由可以骄傲自满，可以懈怠松劲。我们一定要努力克服这些缺点，奋勇前进。
    我们有绝对的信心，因为我们有亲爱的党在指引我们。只要我们听党的话，坚决遵循党的文艺方向，贯彻党的文艺方针，努力学习，深入生活，改造自己的世界观，和右倾思想作不妥协的斗争，鼓足干劲继续跃进，我们就一定能在胜利的基础上取得更大的胜利。
