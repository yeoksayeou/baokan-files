    Static Load Capacity of Freight Cars
    Static load capacity of freight cars is an important economic indicator used by the railway to calculate the efficiency of freight car loading in a static state. It refers to the tonnage of goods loaded in each car.
    The railway transports a wide variety of goods, which can generally be divided into two major categories: heavy goods and light goods. Heavy goods such as steel, iron, coal, ore, and gravel are easily loaded to the freight car's specified load capacity (marked load). Another type, light goods, such as cotton, hay, empty barrels, automobiles, etc., only reach 30% to 70% of the marked load when a car is full. If railway staff adopt the method of skillful loading to fill the cars to capacity, by combining some heavy goods in the same car, the load capacity can be greatly increased.

    货车静载重
    货车静载重，是铁路计算货车在静止状态下载重效率高低的一项重要经济指标。它指的是每一个车皮所装的货物吨数。
    铁路运送的货物品类繁多，一般可以划分为体重货物和体轻货物两大类。体重货物像钢、铁、煤、矿石、砂石等，很容易达到货车规定的载重量（标记载重）。另一种体轻货物，像棉花、谷草、空桶、汽车等，装满一车只达标记载重的十分之三到十分之七。如果铁路部门职工采取巧装满载的方法，在同样一个车皮里，配上部分体重货物，就能大大提高载重量。
