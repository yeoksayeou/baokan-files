Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 27th. Many rare animals have been discovered in Yunnan Province, providing valuable research data for scientific study.

The primeval forests of subtropical Yunnan are extremely rich in animal resources. Since the beginning of this year, the Zoological Institute of the Yunnan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, through preliminary collection and investigation in Mengla and Menglun, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, has compiled 220 species of animal specimens, numbering more than 1,500. These include gibbons, highly economically valuable sika deer, precious double-horned hornbills, the ancestor of chickens - the red junglefowl, and special amphibians such as flying lizards and flying frogs. In tropical and subtropical rivers, various unique fish species found only in the country, such as Burmese loaches, fragrant loaches, and barbels, have also been discovered.

Since July this year, herds of wild cattle have also been discovered in the large forests around Mengyuan in this autonomous prefecture. Researchers at the Zoological Institute have captured four of them, three of which have since died. The remaining one, after more than three months of specialized care, has gradually acquired the habits of domestic animals.

　　云南发现多种稀有动物
    已整理出二百二十种一千五百多号标本
    新华社昆明27日电　云南省发现许多种稀有动物，为科学研究提供了宝贵的研究资料。
    云南亚热带地区的原始森林里，动物资源极为丰富。今年以来，中国科学院云南分院动物研究所仅在西双版纳傣族自治州的勐腊、勐仑等地，经过初步采集调查，已经整理出二百二十种一千五百多号动物标本，其中有长臂猿，经济价值很高的水鹿，珍贵的双角犀鸟，鸡类的祖先——原鸡，特殊的两栖动物飞蜥和飞蛙等。在热带和亚热带的河流中，还发现了缅瓜鱼、香瓜鱼和鲃鱼等多种全国仅有的鱼类。
    今年7月以来，这个自治州的勐远一带的大森林里，还发现有成群的野牛。动物研究所的研究人员先后捕获了四条，其中三条已经死去。目前剩下的一条经过专人饲养三个多月后，已经逐渐具有家畜的习性。
