"Voice of the Republic of Algeria" Radio Announces
    Algerian Military and Civilians Determined to Persist in Armed Struggle
    People's Liberation Army Launches Offensive, Breaking Through French Defenses in Multiple Locations
    Xinhua News Agency, December 24th dispatch from Cairo: "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" radio broadcast on the 22nd that the Algerian people and the heroic National Liberation Army are determined to resolutely wage the armed struggle for independence until final victory.
    The radio said that the Algerian national independence war has been fought for more than five years. The Algerian military and civilians throughout the country have made huge sacrifices and experienced arduous days. We must never abandon our principles of struggle. Whoever tries to persuade us to accept conditional independence is betraying our martyrs and all our military and civilians.
    Referring to De Gaulle's verbal expression of recognizing the Algerian people's right to self-determination, the radio pointed out that this is due not to other reasons but to the fact that the heroic Algerian National Liberation Army has grown stronger and intensified its attacks on the enemy over the past five years. To think that French policy has changed is to fail to see the necessity of armed struggle and the achievements of the people and the National Liberation Army over the years.
    The radio station said that the Algerian people want freedom and independence. Now that victory is closer to us than at any time in the past, our people will resolutely abandon those who emphasize difficulties and harm national interests. The people and the National Liberation Army will not allow people to change the program of struggle and the principles of struggle.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 21st: According to a military communique issued here today by the Supreme Command of the Algerian National Liberation Army, since the Algerian National Liberation Army launched an offensive against the French army's "Morice Line" and "Challe Line," which are equipped with electric fences, starting on November 26th, a total of 800 French soldiers have been killed and 70 armored vehicles destroyed.
    The communique said that since the launch of the offensive (which is still ongoing), the Algerian National Liberation Army has broken through the "Morice Line" and the "Challe Line" several times, and has destroyed French barbed wire in Mounier, Lamy, and Kouif, where the breaches occurred.
    The communique revealed that the French aggressor troops had used suffocating poisonous gas three times in an attempt to stop the Algerian National Liberation Army's offensive, but they failed.

　　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台宣告
    阿尔及利亚军民决心坚持武装斗争
    解放军发动攻势突破法军防线多处
    新华社24日讯　开罗消息：“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台22日广播说，阿尔及利亚人民和英勇的民族解放军决心坚决地进行争取独立的武装斗争，直到最后胜利。
    电台说，阿尔及利亚民族独立战争已经打了五年多了，阿尔及利亚全国军民付出了巨大的牺牲，经历了艰苦的日子，我们绝不能背弃我们的斗争原则。谁要说服我们接受有条件的独立，谁就出卖了我们的先烈和全体军民。
    电台在谈到戴高乐口头上表示承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权时指出，这不是由于其他原因，而是由于英勇的阿尔及利亚民族解放军五年来日益壮大、日益加紧打击敌人。如果认为法国的政策改变了，就是看不到武装斗争的必要性，看不到人民和民族解放军几年来的成就。
    这家电台说，阿尔及利亚人民要自由，要独立。现在当胜利比过去任何时刻都更加接近我们的时候，我国人民会坚决抛弃那些强调困难和损害民族利益的人。人民和民族解放军不容许人们改变斗争纲领和斗争原则。
    新华社开罗21日电　据阿尔及利亚民族解放军最高司令部今天在这里发表的一项军事公报说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军从11月26日开始对法军设有电网的“莫里斯防线”和“夏耳防线”发动攻势以来，共打死了八百名法军，击毁七十辆装甲车。
    公报说，发动攻势（现在还在进行中）以来，阿尔及利亚民族解放军曾经几次突破了“莫里斯防线”和“夏耳防线”，并且在突破缺口的默尼埃、拉米和库伊夫等地，摧毁了法军铁丝网。
    公报揭露，法国侵略军曾经三次使用窒息性毒气，企图阻止阿尔及利亚民族解放军的进攻，但是他们失败了。
