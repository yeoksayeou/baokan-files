Talking About Preparation
　　Jing Yu

　　One must prepare for everything. There is preparation for performances, and preparation for production. If the preparation work is done well, things will be much easier; if the preparation work is not done well, one will inevitably be in a temporary rush and feel inadequate. At present, while many production departments are working hard to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule, they are actively and meticulously preparing for next year's production, especially the production in the first quarter of next year. The iron and steel industry department in Hunan is doing a relatively good job in this regard.

　　Whether the production preparation work is done well depends on whether the preparation work is active and meticulous. Active and meticulous preparation can lead to good preparation work. If one is active but not meticulous, even if some preparation work is done well, and other preparation work cannot keep up, it will still affect production. Taking steel production as an example, if the preparation for blast furnace production is ready, but the preparation for ore production cannot keep up, it will affect blast furnace production; if the preparation for ore production is ready, but the internal and external transportation of the factory cannot keep up, it still cannot meet the needs of the blast furnace in time. Therefore, to do a good job in preparation, one must have an active attitude, as well as careful consideration and comprehensive arrangements. One must grasp both the previous process and the next process; one must grasp both the left link and the right link. The upper, lower, left, and right processes and production links constitute the entire production, just like an orchestra, where various instruments cooperate to play a harmonious symphony.

　　A month ago, the iron and steel production departments in Hunan Province deployed ten major preparation tasks, making a series of arrangements from ideological preparation, organizational measures, technical measures, and the front, back, left, and right of steel production; after the arrangements were made, they also mobilized the masses of workers to conduct a comprehensive mass inspection, striving for a good start and a complete success next year. It seems that this kind of preparation is both proactive and meticulous. It is said to be proactive not only because they started early, but also because they timely organized a large-scale mass inspection, which may truly implement the preparation work. It is said to be meticulous not only because they considered the upper, lower, left, and right, but more importantly because they grasped ideological preparation, organizational measures, and technical measures. This makes the work more proactive.

　　We continued to leap forward this year, and we will continue to leap forward next year. What about our ideological preparation? To be full of energy, strive for the top, and always act as a promoter is one kind of ideological preparation. To be passive and conservative, willing to be at the bottom, and bowing to difficulties everywhere is another kind of ideological preparation. Whether the ideology is negative or positive, conservative or progressive, middle-of-the-road or top-notch, determines the pace of progress. The vast majority of comrades are ideologically prepared to continue to leap forward, and their slogan is: further develop the mass movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, tap potential from within the enterprise, and continuously improve labor productivity and production levels. Some people lack this kind of ideological preparation. In their view, after years of leaping forward, we are almost at the top. The people are the same people, the equipment is the same equipment, how much more can we leap forward next year? The implication is a lack of confidence. They do not think of tapping potential from people's wisdom and from the innovation of equipment.

　　Without the idea of a leap forward, there is no pace of a leap forward. For the continued leap forward next year, we must have meticulous preparation, including ideological preparation, material preparation, and organizational preparation. Here, ideological preparation is more important. This is to establish a firm ideological concept: strive for the top and tap the potential of production through technological innovation to do a good job in various preparation tasks.

　　谈准备

    做任何事情都得要有准备。演出有演出的准备，生产有生产的准备。准备工作做好了，事情就好办得多；准备工作没有做好，就不免临时仓皇，捉襟见肘。现在，许多生产部门在抓紧提前完成全年计划的同时，积极而又周密地为明年的生产特别是明年第一季度的生产做好生产准备工作。湖南钢铁工业部门就是做得较好的一个。
    生产准备工作做得好不好，关键在于准备工作是否积极、周密。积极而又周密，准备工作就可能做好。积极而不周密，尽管有一部分准备工作做好了，而另一部分准备工作跟不上去，仍然要影响生产。拿钢铁生产来说，高炉的生产准备好了，矿石的生产准备工作跟不上去，就要影响高炉的生产；矿石的生产准备好了，厂内外的交通运输跟不上去，仍然不能及时满足高炉的需要。所以，要做好准备工作，既要有积极的态度，又要有周密的考虑和全面的安排，既要抓住上道工序，也要抓住下道工序；既要抓住左边的环节，也要抓住右边的环节。上下左右各个工序和生产环节构成了生产整体，像管弦队一样各种乐器互相配合才能奏出合拍的交响曲。
    一个月以前，湖南省的钢铁生产部门就布置了十大准备工作，从思想准备、组织措施、技术措施以及钢铁生产的前后左右，做了一系列的安排；在安排停当以后，还发动职工群众进行一次全面的群众性的大检查，争取明年开门红、满堂红。看来，这种准备工作是主动的也是周密的。说它是主动的，不仅仅是因为他们抓得早，还因为他们及时地组织了群众性的大规模的检查，这就可能使准备工作真正落实。说它是周密的，不仅仅是因为他们考虑了上下左右，更重要的还因为他们抓住了思想准备、组织措施和技术措施。这就使工作更加主动。
    今年继续跃进，明年还要继续跃进，思想准备怎么样？鼓足干劲，力争上游，永远充当促进派，这是一种思想准备。消极保守，甘居下游，处处向困难低头，这又是一种思想准备。思想究竟是消极的还是积极的，是保守的还是促进的，是中游的还是上游的，这决定着前进步伐。绝大多数的同志是有着继续跃进的思想准备的，他们的口号是：进一步开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，从企业内部挖掘潜力，不断提高劳动生产率，提高生产水平。也有人是缺乏这种思想准备的。在他们看来，年年跃进，差不多已经到顶了，人是原来的人，设备是原来的设备，明年还能继续跃进多少呢？言下之意，缺乏信心。他们却想不到从人们的智慧里、从设备的革新里去挖掘潜力。
    没有跃进的思想，就没有跃进的步伐。为了明年的继续跃进，我们要有周密的准备，包括思想准备、物质准备、组织准备，这里，更重要的是思想准备。这就是要确立这样一种牢固的思想观念：力争上游、从技术革新中挖掘生产潜力来做好各项准备工作。
