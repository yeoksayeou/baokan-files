    Three-Purpose Chaff Cutter
    Chops 10,000 Catties of Grass Daily
    The Red Flag Machinery Factory in A’fang District, Xi’an City, has manufactured a three-purpose (manual, animal-powered, electric) chaff cutter.
    This type of chaff cutter has a simple structure and is relatively inexpensive, costing about 100 yuan per unit. It can chop 8,000 to 10,000 catties of grass per day, increasing efficiency more than eight times compared to manual labor, while also reducing labor intensity.

    三用铡草机
    日铡万斤草
    西安市阿房区红旗机械厂制成一部三用（人力、畜力、电力）铡草机。
    这种铡草机结构简单，价格也比较低廉，每台约值一百多元。每日可铡草八千到一万斤，比人工提高效率八倍多，同时可减轻劳动强度。
