Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: According to Saigon news, South Vietnamese artists are living impoverished, miserable, and desperate lives under the cruel rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

　　In the two years of 1957-1958, forty theater troupes in Saigon were forced to disband, and three more were disbanded in July of this year. Many other troupes are in dire straits.

　　Because the Ngo Dinh Diem clique places so many restrictions on scripts and performances, many troupes can only perform old plays that audiences don't want to see. As a result, theaters are deserted, and troupes have to disband one after another.

　　Another reason for the disbanding of many troupes is the excessive tax burden. The "entertainment tax" is stipulated to be 33% of the total income, and many troupes are sued by the court for failing to pay the tax. At the same time, Ngo Dinh Diem's henchmen often take advantage of their power to watch plays without buying tickets, and ordinary people are too poor to enjoy the theater, which also contributes to the disbanding of many troupes.

　　Tragic events for South Vietnamese artists are endless. A well-known South Vietnamese actor, Jiu Ming, was fired after falling ill and, driven to despair, hanged himself in a theater toilet in Saigon. Many artists are forced to change careers, some to sell beer, and some to drive pedicabs. A South Vietnamese "People's Daily" article at the end of May this year stated that the fate of most South Vietnamese artists is: "They have, and will, die miserably in charity hospitals, under the stage, on the sidewalk, or at the entrance of the theater."

### 穷困、凄惨、绝望、自杀  南越艺人走投无路

    穷困、凄惨、绝望、自杀
    南越艺人走投无路
    新华社河内讯　据西贡消息，在吴庭艳集团的残酷统治下，南越艺人正过着穷困、凄惨、绝望的生活。
    在1957—1958年的两年中，西贡有四十个剧团被迫解散，今年7月份又有三个剧团被解散。另外还有不少剧团处于困境中。
    由于吴庭艳集团对剧本和演出的限制特别多，许多剧团只能上演一些观众们不想看的旧剧，因此，剧院门前冷落，剧团不得不纷纷解散。
    许多剧团解散的另一个原因是赋税过重。“游戏税”规定为总收入的33％，许多剧团因为交不出税而被法院起诉。同时，吴庭艳的爪牙经常仗势不买票看戏，普通人民则生活贫困，无力去欣赏戏剧，也是促使许多剧团解散的原因。
    南越艺人的悲惨事件层出不穷。南越著名演员九明因病被解雇后，走投无路而吊死在西贡一家戏院的厕所里。许多艺人被迫改行，有的去卖啤酒，有的去蹬三轮车。南越“民众报”今年5月底在一篇文章中说，南越大部分艺人的命运是：“已经、并且将要在济贫医院、在舞台下面、在人行道上或在戏院的门口凄惨地死去”。
