Comprehensive Planning, Multi-Level Management, Breeding and Fattening, Each with its Own Focus
Baiquan County Builds a Pig Raising Base Network

Harbin, December 25th (Our Newspaper) – Baiquan County has built a pig-raising base network and is raising a large number of pigs, becoming a model county with the most pigs in Heilongjiang. The proportion of collective pig raising in the county has reached 71%. The number of sows in collective pig farms has surged from 17,000 to 94,000 in just over a year. The county's pig inventory has reached 300,000, more than double that at the beginning of the year, averaging 1.3 pigs per person.

The pig-raising base in Baiquan County was gradually established after the communization. Previously, the county had less than 100,000 pigs, and the proportion of publicly raised pigs was only 2%. After the communization, the county, taking grain as the key and pig raising as the focus, conscientiously implemented the Party Central Committee's pig-raising policy of "giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production" and "giving priority to public raising and combining public and private raising." Through comprehensive planning, relying on the masses to select locations with higher terrain, better sunshine, and suitable for epidemic prevention, state-owned and people's commune-level commodity pig production bases were established in a planned manner. The division of labor for these bases is as follows: one of the five state-owned pig and livestock farms is a breeding farm, and four are large-scale pig farms providing commodity pigs; the eighteen people's commune's comprehensive livestock farms mainly focus on pig breeding; the 272 management area's pig farms focus on both breeding and fattening; and the 1,500+ production team's pig farms mainly focus on fattening. The widespread establishment of pig-raising bases has created extremely favorable conditions for planned large-scale selection and retention of sows, breeding of piglets, careful feeding of fattening pigs, and vigorous development of the pig-raising industry.

When the pig-raising base in the county was just set up, some difficulties were encountered in terms of feed and feeding management. At this time, some people with right-leaning ideas called for dismantling the pig farms of the people's communes and management areas. The Baiquan County Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this situation and immediately mobilized the masses to express their opinions and debate, criticizing the capitalist viewpoint that large collective pig raising was not as good as small collective pig raising, and small collective pig raising was not as good as individual pig raising. The county committee also sent down a group of cadres to strengthen the leadership of the bases, and members of the county committee also took charge of specific areas for inspection and guidance. The livestock farms at all levels also carried out the "three fixings" work of "fixing leaders, fixing personnel, and fixing remuneration," and established various systems and feed bases for the pig farms, so that the pig-raising bases were further consolidated and developed ideologically and organizationally. The Zhongxing People's Commune strengthened the leadership of the base and mobilized the masses to adopt feed crops such as intercropping gourds in potato fields, opening wineries and flour mills, and comprehensively utilizing raw materials such as potatoes and gourds, greatly reducing the cost of pig raising. In the past ten months, the number of pigs has increased tenfold. Thanks to the professional institutions managing pig breeding in pig-raising bases throughout the county and the promotion of methods such as double mating, heat mating, artificial insemination, and drug-induced estrus, the rate of pig reproduction is very high. The county's breeding farm's pigs have increased twenty-two times this year. Currently, 60% of the county's pigs are improved breeds after hybridization. The proportion of publicly raised pigs in the county has rapidly increased from 28% at the beginning of the establishment to 71%.

While vigorously developing the collective pig-raising industry, Baiquan County also attaches great importance to individual pig raising. This year, the county's pig farms allocated more than 50,000 piglets to the commune members for raising, making full use of labor potential and family feed potential. 98% of the county's farmers raised fattening pigs.

The development of the pig-raising industry in Baiquan County, coupled with the People's Commune's full play of the power of agricultural machinery, has resulted in a nearly 20% increase in grain production this year compared to last year's bumper harvest. The procurement task for commodity grain in the county exceeded the plan by 250,000 tons. The number of pigs supporting industrial and mining and forestry areas also increased by more than 31,000 compared to last year, and 17,000 piglets, boars, and sows were transferred from pig farms to support the development of the pig-raising industry in other areas. The total output value of pigs sold this year reached 5.25 million yuan, an average increase in income of 90 yuan per household. The people's communes in the county used the funds accumulated from pig raising to buy more than 80 tractors.

　　全面规划　多级经营　繁殖育肥　各有重点
    拜泉县建成养猪基地网
    本报哈尔滨25日电　拜泉县建成了一个养猪基地网，大量养猪，已成为黑龙江养猪最多的标兵县。现在这县集体养猪的比重已经达到71％，集体养猪场的母猪，一年多来从一万七千头猛增到九万四千头；全县存栏猪达三十万头，比年初猛增一倍多，平均一人一点三头。
    拜泉县的养猪基地是在公社化以后逐步建立起来的。以前，全县养猪不足十万头，公养的猪比重只占2％。公社化以后，全县以粮为纲，以养猪为重点，认真贯彻执行党中央关于“自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举”，“以公养为主，公养私养并举”的养猪方针，全面规划，依靠群众挑选地势较高、日照较好、适宜防疫的地点，有计划地建立了国营和人民公社各级的生猪商品生产基地。这些基地的分工是：五个国营养猪畜牧场中有一个良种繁殖场，四个是提供商品猪的大型猪场；十八个人民公社的综合畜牧场主要以繁殖生猪为主；二百七十二个管理区的养猪场则以繁殖和育肥并重；一千五百多个生产队的养猪场主要以育肥为主。养猪基地的广泛建立，为有计划地大量选留母猪、繁殖小猪、精心饲养肥猪，大力发展养猪事业创造了极为有利的条件。
    当这个县的养猪基地刚搭起架子，在饲料和饲养管理方面一时曾遇到一些困难。这个时候，有些思想右倾的人就叫喊拆散人民公社和管理区的养猪场。中共拜泉县委发现这个情况，立刻发动了群众鸣放辩论，批判了这种大集体养猪不如小集体养猪、小集体养猪不如个体养猪的资本主义的观点。县委还下放一批干部加强了基地的领导，县委委员也分片包干巡回指导。各级畜牧场也进行“定领导、定人员、定报酬”的三定工作，建立了养猪场的各项制度和饲料基地，使各个养猪基地从思想上、组织制度上进一步得到巩固和发展。中兴人民公社加强了基地的领导，发动群众采取土豆田混种角瓜等饲料作物，开酒坊、粉坊，综合利用土豆角瓜等原料，大大降低养猪成本，今年十个月来猪增殖了十倍。全县各养猪基地由于有专业机构管理猪的繁殖工作，推行了双配、热配、人工授精、药剂催情等办法，猪的增殖率很高。县良种繁殖场的猪今年翻了二十二番，目前全县60％的猪都是杂交后的改良品种。全县公养猪的比重迅速从建场时的28％提高到71％。
    拜泉县在大力发展集体养猪事业的同时，对个体养猪也十分重视。今年全县养猪场拨出了五万多头仔猪交给社员饲养，充分利用劳动潜力和家庭饲料潜力，全县98％的农户都养了肥猪。
    拜泉县养猪事业的发展，加上人民公社充分发挥农业机械的威力，今年粮食产量比去年大丰收还增产近二成，全县商品粮的采购任务比计划超额二十五万吨。支援工矿、林区的猪也比去年增加了三万一千多头，并且还从养猪场调出仔、公、母猪一万七千头支援外地发展养猪事业。今年外销的猪总产值达五百二十五万元，平均每户增加收入达九十元。全县各人民公社用养猪积累的资金买了拖拉机八十多台。
