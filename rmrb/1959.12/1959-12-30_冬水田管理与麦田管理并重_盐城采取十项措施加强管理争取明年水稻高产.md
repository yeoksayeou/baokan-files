Equal Emphasis on Winter Water Field Management and Wheat Field Management
Yancheng Adopts Ten Measures to Strengthen Management and Strive for High Rice Yields Next Year

(Our Report) A winter-spring water field management movement, with ten constructions as its main content, is vigorously unfolding in Yancheng County, Jiangsu. The broad masses are determined to make the 1960 rice yield catch up with Suzhou.

Yancheng County has 500,000 mu of single-season rice paddy, accounting for more than 30% of the total cultivated land area. This year's paddy field management work, inspired by the county party committee's battle call to "strive for comprehensive advancement in winter production," has greatly exceeded previous years. Experience over the years has proven that good management of paddy fields during the winter and spring will determine next year's rice yield increase, so this is a strategic measure. In order to achieve the goal of making the 1960 rice yield catch up with Suzhou, the Yancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently criticized the idea of ​​underestimating paddy field management at a meeting of the first secretaries of the commune party committees, and demanded that paddy field management be raised to the same important position as wheat field management. On the basis of raising awareness, the winter-spring paddy field management work was seriously discussed. The general requirements are: one ripeness (thorough rotting), two flatness (harrowing evenly, leveling evenly), three absences (no arrowhead grass, no water chestnut, no clover roots), four modernizations (strip-farming, garden-farming, systematization, archival record-keeping), and five sufficiency (sufficient water, sufficient fertilizer, sufficient seeds, sufficient seedling plots, sufficient management personnel).

The specific ten construction contents are as follows: (1) Establish a professional team to manage paddy fields. One experienced farmer administrator is assigned to every twenty mu of land to implement a "five-fixed" responsibility system of fixed person, fixed field, fixed task, fixed time, and fixed remuneration to ensure consistent management from beginning to end; (2) Multiple tilling and deep plowing. Early and mid-season rice stubble fields are generally plowed four times, and late rice stubble fields are generally plowed twice in winter, and then plowed four times in spring for transplanting, maintaining a depth of six to eight inches to achieve fields as flat as a mirror and mud as rotten as soup; (3) Seize the favorable opportunity in winter to organize continuous assaults, eliminating all noxious weeds such as arrowhead, water chestnut, and clover before the winter solstice, removing one piece at a time and cleaning one piece at a time; (4) Maintain sufficient water to soak the fields, according to the requirements of deep irrigation in winter and watering in spring, constantly ensuring no water shortage, focusing on the management of arrowhead fields, water chestnut fields, and riverside fields to ensure that not a single mu of land is frozen or dried out; (5) Build fertilizer storage at field heads. A fertilizer storage is set up for every ten mu of land, with a storage capacity of 3,000 dan of mixed fertilizer (quality equivalent to concentrated fertilizer). Vigorously carry out the mass movement of accumulating fertilizer, comprehensively implement the policy of combining coarse and fine, and combining organic and inorganic fertilizers, grasping both pig raising to accumulate concentrated fertilizer and vigorously engaging in "four downs to the south" mud to accumulate coarse fertilizer, and organizing a part of the labor force to collect aquatic plants, cut grass turf, collect fallen leaves, and sweep garbage, mixing them with silt for fermentation to turn coarse fertilizer into fine fertilizer, and at the same time, follow the steps of first coarse and then fine, striving to apply sufficient base fertilizer once in winter and then twice in spring, and then once more with fine fertilizer during transplanting; (6) Repair and replenish agricultural tools. All water-drawing tools are completely repaired in winter, with dedicated personnel for management to meet irrigation needs. At the same time, actively reform deep tillage and deep plowing tools to improve work efficiency; (7) Vigorously carry out land leveling and consolidation, eliminate triangular fields, tofu fields, and sunken fields, basically achieving strip-farming and standardization; (8) Pick up rice roots, clear all weeds from field ridges, roadsides, and graves, preventing any pests from overwintering, and rotting or burning the weeds for fertilizer, so that pests have no offspring; (9) Combine mechanical and electrical irrigation with winter construction of farmland water conservancy to improve saline-alkali soil and eliminate residual alkali fields; (10) Select a good seedling plot base. Establish one mu of seedling plot base for every eight to ten mu of large field, clearly assign dedicated personnel for management, focus on processing, complete deep plowing four to five times in winter, apply base fertilizer one to two times, and then plow twice in spring, striving to apply sufficient three to four times of concentrated fertilizer before sowing seedlings.

At present, the winter-spring paddy field management movement, with ten constructions as its main content, is vigorously unfolding and has achieved preliminary results. The number of professional personnel participating in paddy field management throughout the county has increased from more than 7,000 to more than 18,000. Basically every mu of the 500,000 mu of paddy field has sufficient water, and everywhere there is the sight of "wheat growing a green expanse, and paddy fields rotting into a white expanse." Recently, the county party committee put forward the battle call of "resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate noxious weeds," and leaders at all levels took command and led the troops to launch a large-scale campaign against noxious weeds. The entire county has 25,000 full and semi-labor force participating in the concentrated weeding, and more than 80% of the area that should be weeded has been cleared. The county and communes have held on-site meetings comparing the good and bad of paddy field weeding. Such leadership determination and heroic action this year are unprecedented in history.

　　冬水田管理与麦田管理并重
    盐城采取十项措施加强管理争取明年水稻高产
    本报讯　江苏盐城县以十项建设为主要内容的冬春水田管理运动正蓬勃开展。广大群众决心争取1960年水稻产量赶上苏州。
    盐城县一年一熟的水稻田有五十万亩，占耕地总面积30％以上。今年的水田管理工作，在县委提出的“力争冬季生产全面站上游”的战斗号召鼓舞下，已大大超过往年。历年经验证明，冬春期间对水田管理得好，将决定明年水稻的增产，因此这是一项战略性的措施。为了争取实现1960年水稻产量赶上苏州的奋斗目标，中共盐城县委在最近召开的公社党委第一书记会议上，批判了轻视水田管理的思想，要求把水田管理提高到与麦田管理一样重要的位置上来。在提高认识的基础上，认真的讨论了冬春水田管理工作。总的要求是一熟（沤得熟）、二平（耙得平、整得平）、三无（无彰舌爪、无山狼果、无四叶菜根）、四化（条田化、园田化、制度化、档案化）、五足（水足、肥足、种子足、秧池足、管理人员足）。
    具体的有以下十项建设内容：（1）建立管理水田的专业队伍。按二十亩田设一老农管理员，实行定人、定田、定任务、定时间、定报酬的“五定”责任制，保证自始至终一管到底；（2）多耕深耕。早中稻茬子田普遍耕四遍，晚稻茬子田普耕两遍过冬，春季再耕四遍插秧，深度保持六至八寸，达到田平如镜，泥烂如羹；（3）抓住冬季有利时机组织连续突击，将彰舌、山狼、四叶菜等一切恶草全部消灭在冬至之前，做到除一块，清一块；（4）保持足水沤田，按照冬天深灌，春天浇灌的要求，经常不脱水，对慈菇田、荸荠田、河边田作重点管理，保证不冻沙、不干坏一亩田；（5）建田头肥库。每十亩田设一田头肥料库，每库容积混合肥三千担（质量相当于精肥）。大搞积肥群众运动，全面贯彻粗细并举，有机质肥与无机质肥并举的积肥方针，既抓养猪积精肥，又抓大搞“四下南”泥积粗肥，并组织一部分劳力搞水草、割草皮、收落叶、扫垃圾，同淤泥拌和起来发酵，使粗肥变成精肥，同时按照先粗后精的步骤，力争冬季施足基肥一遍，春季再施两遍，栽插时再施一遍细肥；（6）修添农具。车水工具在冬季全部修好，确定专人管理，适应灌溉需要。同时，积极改革深耕深翻工具，提高工效；（7）大搞平田整地，消灭三角田、豆腐田、凹洼田，基本实现条田化、规格化；（8）拾清稻根，铲清田岸、路旁和坟地上的一切杂草，不让一个害虫过冬，并将杂草沤烂烧毁作肥，要虫害断子绝孙；（9）结合机电灌溉和冬季兴修农田水利，改良盐碱土，消灭尾碱田；（10）选好秧池基地。按每八至十亩大田建立一亩秧池基地，明确专人管理，重点加工，冬季完成深耕四至五遍，基肥一至二遍，春天再耕两遍，力争春季施足三至四遍精肥才下秧。
    目前，以十项建设为主要内容的冬春水田管理运动正在蓬勃开展，并初步取得了成就。全县参加水田管理的专业人员已由七千多人增加到一万八千多人。五十万亩水田基本是亩亩足水，到处出现了“麦子长得一片绿，水田沤得一片白”的气象。最近县委提出“坚决、彻底、全部消灭恶草”的战斗号召，各级领导干部挂帅领兵，向恶草大进军。全县参加突击除草的整半劳动力有二万五千人，已除清的占应除面积80％以上。县和公社都召开了水田锄草的好坏对比现场会议。像今年这样的领导决心和豪壮的行动，都是历史上所没有过的。
