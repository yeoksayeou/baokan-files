The United States Owes the Philippines Nine Hundred Million Dollars
Philippine Authorities Demand Full Repayment from the United States

According to a report in the "Manila Chronicle" on the 15th, the Philippine government has once again requested the United States to reopen negotiations on the Philippine side's claim for a total of nine hundred million dollars in war damages and gold devaluation. This decision was made by President Garcia and Foreign Minister Serrano at a meeting on the 14th in response to the Senate's renewed demand for settlement of unpaid reparations.

According to reports, Serrano said that he had sent a note to the U.S. State Department explaining the Philippines' position and refuting the U.S. arguments attempting to reject the Philippines' demands.

The Philippines has long demanded a resolution to the nine hundred million dollar "package compensation claim." However, the United States only agreed to pay a sum of twenty-three million dollars this February. This sum was compensation for losses suffered by the Philippines due to a dollar devaluation twenty-five years ago. The United States continues to refuse the Philippine claims, including: 1. Illegal taxes levied by the United States on Philippine coconut oil consumption amounting to one hundred and seventy-three million dollars; 2. Wartime arrears in pay for Philippine officers, soldiers, and organized guerrillas amounting to three hundred and forty-five million dollars; 3. Arrears in pay for Filipino soldiers serving in the U.S. regular army amounting to one hundred million dollars.

　　美国拖欠菲律宾九亿美元债款
    菲当局要美国如数偿还
    据“马尼拉纪事报”15日报道，菲律宾政府已再次要求美国就菲律宾方面提出的总数为九亿美元的战时损失和黄金贬值等方面的赔偿问题重开谈判。这个决定是由总统加西亚和外交部长塞兰诺在14日的一个会议上就参议院人士重新要求清算未支付的赔款一事作出的。
    据报道，塞兰诺说，他给美国国务院发了一份照会，说明菲律宾的立场并驳斥美国企图拒绝菲律宾的要求的论据。
    菲律宾长期来一直要求解决九亿美元的“一揽子赔偿要求”。但是美国只在今年2月同意支付两千三百万美元的一笔款项。这一笔款项是赔偿菲律宾由于二十五年前的一次美元贬值而遭受的损失。美国仍然拒绝菲律宾所要求的债款包括：一，美国对菲律宾椰油消费征收的非法税款一亿七千三百万美元；二，菲律宾官兵及有组织的游击部队的战时服役欠薪三亿四千五百万美元；三，在美国正规军中服役的菲律宾的军人的欠薪一亿美元。
