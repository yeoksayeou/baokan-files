Infinite Vitality
    Liu Ziqi
    After seeing a series of paintings on the theme of "starting from scratch," I was inspired with some reflections.

    I think, if there is a kind of flower that can bloom unyieldingly despite wind and rain, then this flower itself must possess infinite and powerful vitality.

    Four demobilized soldiers, empty-handed, accepted the task of producing alloys, starting from a spoon, two pots, and three molds. After nine years, after enduring many setbacks and failures, they finally built a large factory from scratch. Isn't this a vibrant flower that has overcome various difficulties and bloomed without wilting? Then, where does its infinite and powerful vitality lie?

    At first, the four people were indeed "empty-handed"; they had neither any tools nor any technical knowledge. "Empty-handed," of course, they could not produce alloys. But they dared to accept the task assigned by the Party. What did they rely on? They relied on their revolutionary spirit and creative spirit. With this, they could use their "empty hands" to gradually create all the necessary conditions: No tools? They could run around borrowing them. No technology? They could study day and night. No one willing to place orders? They could go "guerrilla," carrying simple production equipment to the customer's door for on-site production. Conditions not good enough? They could use the conditions they had already created to create even better ones: innovate technology, expand equipment, increase workers... Thus, a modern factory "like a city" appeared, with more than two thousand workers, more than three hundred kinds of products, and even foreigners came to place orders.

    A great and vigorous enterprise began with running around borrowing tools. Conditions were constantly improving, but throughout it all, what permeated was their abundant and overflowing revolutionary spirit and creative spirit. The infinite vitality of the "starting from scratch" flower is nothing other than the crystallization of the high integration of this revolutionary spirit and creative spirit.

    This matter gives us a deep enlightenment: People should naturally not be idealists, and therefore cannot think that without the current conditions, they can produce more than three hundred kinds of alloys. However, people should also not be mechanical materialists, and therefore, cannot think that when they are still "empty-handed," they cannot gradually create these conditions at all. People should be dialectical materialists: they must recognize that conditions are necessary, but they are also created by people. We are "empty-handed," but we must also create, using revolutionary spirit to realize this creation, which is the essence of "starting from scratch."

    "Starting from scratch" is not a rootless flower; it is precisely the consistent revolutionary tradition of the Chinese people. Whether it was the establishment of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, or the establishment of revolutionary base areas, which one was not "starting from scratch" under the leadership of the Party? The current socialist construction is an era of "starting from scratch" flowers blooming everywhere. The whole people's mass steelmaking and the whole people's large-scale water conservancy projects, which mass movement is not "starting from scratch"? If we compare our great leaping forward nation to a large garden, then in this garden, there are modern construction flowers and "starting from scratch" flowers everywhere, competing in beauty. The Party's general line for building socialism is precisely to promote the flourishing of these blooming flowers! The "poor and blank" face of our motherland will also be changed more rapidly as a result.

    Under the Party's call to oppose right-leaning conservatism and boost energy, the revolutionary spirit and creative spirit of the Chinese people are being carried forward to a higher degree. Everyone is striving for excellence, fearing to lag behind. "Starting from scratch" flower, facing the east wind and sunshine, further unfold your infinite and powerful vitality! From this, I also thought of two lines of poetry: Flowers must bloom overnight, don't wait for the morning breeze to urge!

    无穷的活力
    刘志启
    看了一组“白手起家”的画，引起了一些遐想。
    我想，如果有一种花，能够在风吹雨打之下盛开不败，那末，这种花本身一定具有无穷的强大活力。
  四个复员军人，赤手空拳地接受了生产合金的任务，由一把勺子、二口锅、三个模子开始生产起，经过了九年时间，经过许许多多挫折和失败的考验，终于从一片白地上建立起了一个大工厂。这不正是战胜了各种困难长开不败的一朵鲜花吗？那末，它的无穷的强大活力又在哪里呢？
    四个人起初的确都是“白手”，一没有任何工具，二不懂一点技术；“白手”自然无法生产出合金。但是他们却敢于接受党交给的这种任务，他们靠了什么？靠了他们的革命精神和创造精神。有了这，他们就能用“白手”去逐步创造各种必需的条件：没有工具吗？可以东奔西跑地去借；没有技术吗？可以不分昼夜地学；没有人肯来订货吗？可以去“打游击”，扛着简单的生产设备，到顾主门上去生产。条件还不够好吗？可以利用已经创造的条件再去创造：革新技术，扩充设备，增加工人……于是“像一座城”一样的现代化工厂出现了，二千多个工人，三百多种产品，连外国人也跑来订货了。
    一番轰轰烈烈的事业，是从东奔西跑着借工具开始的。条件不断在改善着，但贯串始终的却是他们的充沛洋溢的革命精神和创造精神。“白手起家”之花的无穷活力不是别的，正是这种革命精神同创造精神高度结合的结晶。
    这件事给我们深深的启发：人自然不应该是唯心论者，因此不能认为没有目前这样的条件就可以生产出三百多种合金来，但是，人也不应该是机械唯物论者，因此，不能认为，当还是“白手”的时候，便根本无法去逐步创造这些条件。人应该是辩证唯物论者：要认清条件是必要的，但它同时又是由人创造的。我们是“白手”，但又要创造，用革命精神去实现这种创造，这便是“白手起家”的实质。
    “白手起家”，并非无根之花，它正是中国人民一贯的革命传统，党所领导的中国革命，无论是创立工农红军，无论是建立革命根据地，哪一宗又不是“白手起家”的呢？目前的社会主义建设，正是一个遍地盛开“白手起家”之花的时代，全民大炼钢铁，全民大兴水利，哪一种群众运动又不是“白手起家”？如果把我们大跃进的国家比作一个大花园，那末，在这个花园里，到处都是现代化建设之花同“白手起家”之花，竞相斗艳着的。党的建设社会主义的总路线，正是要促使这盛开的鲜花更加欣欣向荣！我们祖国“一穷二白”的面貌，也将因此更加迅速的改观。
    在党的反透右倾大鼓干劲的号召下，中国人民的革命精神和创造精神正在更高的发扬，人人都在争芳斗艳，恐后争先。“白手起家”之花啊，迎着东风和阳光，更加舒展你无穷而又强大的活力吧，由此我也想起了两句诗：花须连夜发，莫待晓风催！
