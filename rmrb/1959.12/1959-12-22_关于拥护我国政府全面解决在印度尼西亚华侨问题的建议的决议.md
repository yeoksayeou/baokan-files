　　Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Resolution of the Enlarged Fourth Plenary Session of the First Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese on Supporting the Chinese Government's Proposal for a Comprehensive Solution to the Overseas Chinese Issue in Indonesia.

　　The Enlarged Fourth Plenary Session of the First Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese listened to the opening speech by Chairman Chen Jiageng, discussed the serious situation caused by the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia, and unanimously passed the following resolution regarding the Chinese government's proposal to the Indonesian government on a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese issue:

　　(1) The meeting firmly supports the three proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi on behalf of the Chinese government to the Indonesian government regarding a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese issue. It unanimously believes that these proposals not only fully demonstrate the consistent position of the Chinese government in protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, but also fully demonstrate the sincere desire of the Chinese government to safeguard the friendship between China and Indonesia. The meeting requests the Indonesian government to immediately appoint representatives to negotiate with representatives of the Chinese government on a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese issue in Indonesia.

　　(2) The meeting unanimously condemns and protests the anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities that have emerged in Indonesia. It believes that this is a complete violation of humanitarian principles and the general international norms for treating foreign nationals. This dangerous behavior has seriously damaged the friendship between China and Indonesia. The meeting demands that the Indonesian authorities immediately stop the persecution of overseas Chinese.

　　(3) The meeting extends cordial greetings to the overseas Chinese who have been persecuted in Indonesia, and warmly welcomes the overseas Chinese in Indonesia who have suffered persecution to the point of having no means of livelihood and those who are unwilling to continue to reside there, to return to the embrace of the motherland, and to join the people of the motherland in participating in the great socialist construction cause of the motherland, and to live a peaceful and happy life together. The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese will do its utmost to assist the government in doing a good job in the reception and resettlement of returned overseas Chinese.

　　关于拥护我国政府全面解决在印度尼西亚华侨问题的建议的决议
    新华社21日讯　中华全国归国华侨联合会第一届第四次全体委员会扩大会议关于拥护我国政府全面解决在印度尼西亚华侨问题的建议的决议
    中华全国归国华侨联合会第一届第四次全体委员会扩大会议听取了陈嘉庚主席的开幕词，讨论了在印度尼西亚发生的反华、排华活动所引起的严重局势，一致就我国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出的关于全面解决华侨问题的建议，通过决议如下：
    （一）会议坚决拥护陈毅外长代表我国政府就全面解决华侨问题向印度尼西亚政府所提出的三点建议，一致认为这些建议不仅充分表明了我国政府保护华侨正当权利和利益的一贯立场，而且也充分表明了我国政府对于维护中国和印度尼西亚两国友谊的真诚愿望。会议要求印度尼西亚政府立即指派代表同中国政府的代表就全面解决在印度尼西亚的华侨问题进行谈判。
    （二）会议一致谴责和抗议在印度尼西亚出现的反华、排华暴行。认为这是完全违反人道主义原则和对待外国侨民的一般国际准则的。这种危险的行为已经严重地损害了中国和印度尼西亚的友谊。会议要求印度尼西亚当局立即制止对华侨的迫害活动。
    （三）会议向在印度尼西亚遭受迫害的侨胞致以亲切的慰问，热烈欢迎在印度尼西亚由于受到迫害以致生路断绝，陷于困境的侨胞和那些不愿意继续居留下去的侨胞，全部回到祖国的怀抱，和祖国人民一道参加祖国的伟大社会主义建设事业，共同过和平幸福的生活。中华全国归国华侨联合会将尽全力协助政府做好归国华侨的接待和安置工作。
