    Seeds Cannot Sprout Without Soil in Henan
    Zhengzhou Jin Ke
    All water conservancy construction sites in Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province, are vigorously engaged in "six factories and eight transformations." "Six factories" refers to the establishment of tool manufacturing and repair factories, cement factories, lime factories, explosives factories, green brick factories, and terracotta pipe factories on water conservancy construction sites. "Eight transformations" refers to the use of blasting for excavation, plows and rakes for crushing soil, docks and funnels for loading soil, carts and rails for transporting soil, automated soil unloading, rope traction for lifting soil and stone uphill, rollers for compaction, and ball bearings for rotating tools during construction. The result of "six factories and eight transformations" is that work efficiency has been improved by half, once, and even thirty times.
    After reading this news, I suddenly thought of sunlight and soil, and the adjective we often use: "like bamboo shoots after a spring rain." Isn't the development of today's technological innovation movement just like the situation of bamboo shoots after a spring rain? The emergence of this new situation should undoubtedly be attributed to the leadership of the Party—it is the sunlight necessary for the growth of new technologies; and to the system of people's communes—it is the soil necessary for the growth of new technologies.
    A peasant poet once described the relationship between technological innovation and people's communes like this: Seeds cannot sprout without soil, melon vines cannot blossom without knots. With people's communes in the countryside, technological flowers bloom all over the world.
    In the early days of communization last year, I visited a commune machinery factory. Less than a month after the establishment of the commune, the number of personnel and equipment in this factory increased dozens of times, and the variety of products increased by more than a hundred. Why did it develop so quickly? It's very simple: Before communization, dozens of skilled craftsmen in the entire township were scattered in various small cooperatives, and the township wanted to transfer them to set up a machinery factory, but each small cooperative was unwilling to let them go. Once communization occurred, everyone became one family, and the contradictions were resolved. More importantly, the collective production and collective life after communization itself put forward requirements for mechanization. For example, in the past, each household cooked their own meals, and no one would create a vegetable cutting machine, rice washing machine, or dumpling making machine. Small-scale production also did not require machines.
    The Party's General Line is warm sunlight, the system of people's communes is the most fertile soil for nurturing new technologies, and the revolutionary vigor of the people is the spring rain. With soil, air, temperature, and moisture, good seeds will definitely sprout. The technological innovation movement in Nanyang Prefecture is like this, and the technological innovation movements in other regions are also like this.

    种籽无土不发芽河南
    郑州　金柯
    河南南阳专区各水利工地正在大闹“六厂八化”。“六厂”是指的在水利工地上建立工具制造修配厂、水泥厂、石灰厂、炸药厂、青砖厂、缸管厂。“八化”是指的在施工当中挖土爆破化，碎土犁耙化，装土码头、漏斗化，运土车子、轨道化，卸土自动化，土石上坡绳索牵引化，夯实磙碾化，转动工具滚珠轴承化。“六厂八化”的结果是：提高工效半倍、一倍直至三十倍。
    看了这条消息，我忽然想起了阳光和泥土，想起了人们所惯用的一个形容词：雨后春笋。今天技术革新运动的发展，不正像雨后春笋的形势一样吗？这种新形势的出现，无疑应当归功于党的领导——它是新技术生长必需的阳光；归功于人民公社制度——它是新技术生长必需的土壤。
    有一位农民诗人曾经这样描写过技术革新和人民公社的关系：种籽无土不发芽，瓜藤无纽不开花，农村有了大公社，技术花开遍天下。
    去年公社化初期，我曾经访问过一家公社机械厂。这个工厂建立公社后不到一个月，人员、设备猛增几十倍，产品种类增加百多种。为什么发展的这样快？很简单：公社化以前，全乡几十名能工巧匠都分散在各个小社，乡里想调来办个机械厂，各个小社都不肯放。公社化一来大家成了一家人，矛盾解决了。更重要的是，公社化以后集体生产、集体生活的本身提出了机械化的要求。例如，过去一家一户做饭吃，谁也不会去创制切菜机、淘米机、包饺子机，小规模的生产也用不了机器。
    党的总路线是温暖的阳光，人民公社制度是孕育新技术的最肥沃的土壤，人民群众的革命干劲，便是那春天的雨水，良好的种籽有了土壤、空气、温度、水分，一定能够发芽。南阳专区的技术革新运动是如此，其他地区的技术革新运动，也是如此。
