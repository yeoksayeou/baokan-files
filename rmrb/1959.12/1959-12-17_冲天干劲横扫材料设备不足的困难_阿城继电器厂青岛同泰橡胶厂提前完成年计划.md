Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 15th: The Acheng Relay Factory in Harbin, by continuously opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting enthusiasm, and by fully mobilizing the masses to engage in technical innovation and revolution, had already comprehensively and overfulfilled its annual production tasks ahead of schedule by December 10th. According to the annual state plan indicators, output exceeded 4.12%, output value exceeded 8%, labor productivity exceeded 6.86%, product qualification rate exceeded 1.42%, costs were reduced by 1.68%, all forty-six varieties stipulated by the state were completed, and forty-seven new products were trial-produced. Safety accidents were also greatly reduced compared to last year.

　　At the beginning of this year, the factory encountered difficulties in production such as insufficient materials, equipment, electricity, and labor. A few cadres had developed sentiments of fear of difficulty and slackening, such as "the Great Leap Forward last year has already squeezed out all the oil and water" and "how can we complete the task with insufficient materials." In response to this ideology, the factory's Party committee launched a debate among all factory employees by talking about the situation and setting tasks, and criticized this right-leaning conservative thinking. Later, a major quality inspection was carried out, further mobilizing the masses to criticize the erroneous arguments of some cadres who emphasized that "high output cannot be of high quality." Especially since August and September, by implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing right-leaning tendencies, and boosting enthusiasm, the production enthusiasm of the workers continued to rise, and the entire factory quickly launched a mass movement to engage in technical innovation and revolution.

　　This year, the factory universally adopted advanced processing methods such as forging, swaging, extruding, punching, and drawing in terms of technology; implemented one mold for four or more (multiple varieties, multiple sequences, multiple pressures, multiple punches) and universal mold frames in terms of molds; simplified product structures and merged similar products in terms of design; and self-reliantly manufactured 158 simple and specialized equipment in terms of equipment. From January to November this year, the factory has implemented more than 3,600 major technical innovations. These innovative suggestions have played a significant role in improving production efficiency and ensuring the comprehensive completion of the annual production plan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, December 16th: The Qingdao Tongtai Rubber Factory has completed the state plan ahead of schedule in a comprehensive and overfulfilled manner. As of December 10th, the total output value had completed 131.46% of the annual plan; the two products included in the state plan (rickshaw outer tires and inner tubes) had completed 143.15% and 133.1% of the plan, respectively; the product quality all met the national standards; labor productivity exceeded the plan by more than 19%; the product cost was reduced by 0.21% compared to the plan, and profits turned over to the state completed 146.5% of the plan.

　　The factory's rapid, efficient, high-quality, and economical completion of the annual production tasks is the result of adhering to the large-scale mass movement and vigorous technical innovation. Under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, all employees contributed ideas and engaged in innovation, innovated more than 480 technologies around the key production areas, which played a decisive role in achieving a comprehensive leap forward.

　　After this factory criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of "waiting for rice to be cooked" in the third quarter and came up with various ways to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, a contradiction arose that the capacity of the rubber milling equipment could not keep up. However, the factory Party committee mobilized the workshop employees to brainstorm together, improved 19 rubber milling processes and operations, and fully tapped the potential of the equipment, thereby resolving the contradiction.

　　In order to further improve product quality, the factory's leaders, workers, and technicians also adopted the method of holding "three-way combination" on-site meetings to improve rubber milling, vulcanization formulas, and operating methods, and solved the long-standing self-vulcanization phenomenon of window cloth rubber, which not only saved a lot of rubber, but also improved the performance of tires.

    冲天干劲横扫材料设备不足的困难
    阿城继电器厂青岛同泰橡胶厂提前完成年计划
    据新华社哈尔滨15日电　哈尔滨阿城继电器厂不断反右倾、鼓干劲，充分发动群众大搞技术革新和技术革命，到12月10日已经提前全面超额完成全年生产任务。按照全年国家计划指标，产量超过4.12％，产值超过8％，劳动生产率超过6.86％，产品合格率超过1.42％，成本降低1.68％，国家规定的四十六个品种全部完成，并且试制了四十七种新产品，安全事故也比去年大为减少。
    今年年初，这个厂在生产上曾经遇到材料、设备、电力、劳动力等不足的困难，少数干部中曾产生“去年大跃进已把油水挖光”、“材料不足怎能完成任务”等畏难松劲情绪。工厂党委针对这种思想，通过讲形势、摆任务，发动全厂职工开展鸣放辩论；批判了这种右倾保守思想。后来开展质量大检查，进一步发动群众批判了部分干部强调“高产不能优质”等的错误论调。特别是8、9月份以来，贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，反右倾、鼓干劲，职工生产热情不断高涨，全厂迅速掀起了大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。
    这个厂今年在工艺方面普遍采用了锻、搓、挤、冲、拉的先进加工方法；在工模具方面实行了一模四多（多种、多序、多压、多冲）和通用模架；在设计方面简化了产品结构，合并了同类产品；在设备方面，自力更生地制造了简易专用设备一百五十八台。全厂从今年1月到11月份，共实现了重大技术革新三千六百多项。这些革新建议，对提高生产效率，保证全面完成年度生产计划，起了重大作用。
    新华社青岛16日电　青岛同泰橡胶厂提前全面超额完成了国家计划。截至12月10日，总产值已完成年计划的131.46％；列入国家计划的两种产品（力车外胎和内胎），分别完成计划的143.15％和133.1％；产品质量全部合乎国家规定标准；劳动生产率超过计划19％以上；产品成本比计划降低0.21％，上缴利润完成计划146.5％。
    这个厂多快好省地完成全年生产任务，是坚持大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新的结果。全厂职工在厂党委的领导下，人人献计策，个个闹革新，围绕生产关键革新了四百八十多项技术，对实现全面跃进起了决定作用。
    这个厂在第三季度批判了“等米下锅”的右倾保守思想，想出多种办法克服了原料不足的困难之后，出现了碾胶设备能力赶不上的矛盾；但是，工厂党委发动车间职工一齐动脑筋，改进了十九项碾胶的工艺操作，充分挖掘了设备潜力，从而解决了矛盾。
    为进一步提高产品质量，这个厂的领导干部、工人和技术人员，还采用召开“三结合”现场会议的办法，改进碾胶、硫化配方和操作方法，解决了长年没有解决的窗布胶自硫现象，既节约了大量橡胶，又提高了车胎的使用效能。
