Bangkok News: According to Thai newspapers, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Nai Thanom told reporters on October 25 that the U.S. government had agreed to increase military aid to the Thai Army, Navy, and Air Force.

Nai Thanom recently went to the United States to beg for U.S. "aid."

According to Thai newspapers, after lengthy negotiations, the Thai government and the American Oriental Oil Company signed an agreement on the 25th, agreeing in principle that the company would build a refinery in Thailand with a daily output of 28,000 barrels of oil. The news said that the investment in this refinery totaled 750 million baht (equivalent to 35 million U.S. dollars).

Thailand's oil industry has always been monopolized by American and British oil companies. According to statistics, Thailand's annual oil consumption is about one million tons or more, and the Thai government spends a total of 1.8 billion baht in foreign exchange to purchase oil each year, which is almost equal to the total value of Thailand's annual rice exports.

    军援到泰国  石油流美国
    曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，泰国副总理兼国防部长乃他侬10月25日向报界发表谈话说，美国政府已经答应增加对泰国海、陆、空三军的军事援助。
    乃他侬最近曾到美国乞求美“援”。
    据泰国报纸报道，经过长期的谈判以后，泰国政府同美国东方石油公司在25日签订了一项协议书，原则上同意这个公司在泰国建立一座日产二万八千桶石油的炼油厂。消息说，这家炼油厂的投资额共达七亿五千万铢（合三千五百万美元）。
    泰国的石油业一直受到美国和英国的石油公司所垄断。据统计，泰国每年石油的消耗量约在一百万吨以上，泰国政府每年花在购买石油的外汇共达十八亿铢，几乎等于泰国大米每年输出的总值。
