    Rational Transportation Can Only Be Achieved Through Collaboration
    I very much support the short commentary "Once Transported, Many Benefits" on page 2 of the People's Daily on November 28th and the report on the grain transportation experience of Henan Province. Now, I will use an example I encountered to illustrate the disadvantages of not doing a good job of one-time transportation. On the night of November 26th, Comrade Shao from our bureau's supply section was rushing to handle urgent official business and had not yet left work when he suddenly received forty-three boxes of telegraph paper sent by the Shanghai Railway Bureau. The consignee on the delivery note was our bureau, but our bureau could not use so much paper and needed to allocate it to the Municipal Telegraph Bureau (we had noted when ordering from the Shandong Paper Mill that part of the shipment should be sent directly to the Shanghai Municipal Telegraph Bureau). After contacting the Telegraph Bureau, we couldn't find anyone, and the Railway Bureau insisted on unloading the goods. Comrade Shao had no choice but to unload the goods into the warehouse. The next morning, we contacted the Telegraph Bureau, and they were in urgent need of the paper. They quickly sent a jeep to pick up the goods, accompanied by seven or eight comrades responsible for loading and unloading. The vehicle made six round trips, taking four hours to transport all the goods, costing more than twenty yuan in labor and gasoline alone, and the goods were also damaged due to being moved around.
    If the Railway Bureau could have notified the consignee a little earlier, giving the consignee some time to make arrangements, wouldn't it have been possible to transport it rationally? If the Shandong Paper Mill, the consignor, could have entrusted the Railway Bureau to transport the part destined for the Shanghai Municipal Telegraph Bureau directly, as noted on our order plan, wouldn't it have also avoided the waste of "multiple transportations"?
    From the above example, I deeply realize that to achieve rational transportation and avoid wasting transportation resources, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, and using units must all understand the benefits of rationally arranging transportation routes and delivering goods in one go. Large-scale collaboration is essential.

### 大家协作才能实现合理运输

    大家协作才能实现合理运输
    我非常拥护人民日报11月28日二版“一次运到好处很多”的短评和河南省运粮经验的报道。现在，我用一个自己遇到的实例，说明没有做好一次运输的坏处。11月26日深夜，我们局供应科邵同志为了赶办急要公事，尚未下班，突然接到由上海铁路局运来的四十三箱电报用纸，送货单上的收货人是我们局，但是我们局用不了这么多纸，需要往市电报局调拨，（我们在和发货的山东造纸厂订货时，曾注明送到上海市电报局一部分）。和电报局联系，没有找到人，铁路局又坚决要卸货，邵同志只好把货卸到库房里。次晨，我们和电报局联系，他们正急用这批纸，很快就派吉普车来取货，随车还跟来七、八位同志负责装卸，车子共往返六次，花费了四个小时，才把这批货运完，光人工和汽油费就多支出二十多元，而且搬来搬去，货物也受损失。
    如果铁路局能够稍早一点通知收货人，给收货人一点预作部署的时间，不是可以合理地运输吗？如果发货的山东造纸厂能够按照我们订货计划上注明的运到上海市电报局的那部分托铁路局直接运输，不是也可以避免“多次运输”的浪费吗？
    从上述的事例中，使我深深地体会到：要实现合理运输，避免浪费运输力量，必须订货、承制、运输、用货等单位都能理解合理摆布运程、一次运到的好处，大搞协作才行。
