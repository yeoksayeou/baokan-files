Xinhua News Agency, December 7th, Geneva Dispatch: The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "L'Unità" published on December 1st a communiqué regarding the meeting of representatives from seventeen capitalist countries in Europe held in Rome, along with an appeal to all working people and democratic人士 passed by the meeting. Representatives from the Communist Parties of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, San Marino, Sweden, and the Swiss Labour Party participated in the meeting.

The communiqué stated that, at the initiative of the Gramsci Institute, an international conference studying the development of capitalism in Europe was held in Rome from November 21st to 24th. In the following days, the Communist Party representatives from European capitalist countries who participated in this conference broadly exchanged opinions on the issue of unity among the working class and the masses in the struggle for peace, defending and restoring democracy, and striving for the material well-being of working people, and passed an appeal to all working people and democratic人士.

The appeal pointed out that a shift towards easing international tensions has begun. The policies of the Soviet Union and all countries in the socialist camp are based on the advantages already gained in many areas, and are entirely in the service of peace. These positive results show how correct the principles of the declaration made two years ago by sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties, which called on the people of all countries to resolutely and confidently fight for the cause of peace, are.

The appeal highlighted the great significance of the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, and stated that at this historically significant juncture, the working class, working people, and the people of our countries bear a major responsibility.

The appeal said that capitalism has deeply rooted itself in our countries. Aggression aimed at enslaving the people of other continents often originates from our continent. Even today, the ruling classes, backed by the most reactionary groups in the United States, are still attempting to turn this region of Europe into a stronghold of reactionaries, and they continue to cling to the aggressive policies of the Atlantic Pact. Economic groups that directly benefit from the consequences of the "Cold War" and political forces that base their power on maintaining the "Cold War" are hostile to the easing of tensions. The appeal said that imperialism and militarism have now re-established their power in West Germany. After handing over atomic weapons to them, their aggressive forces have become even more dangerous. German revanchists are brewing plans to invade the German Democratic Republic and have territorial ambitions towards various countries. They are a major danger to peace in Europe. Among the ruling groups in the United States, France, Great Britain, Italy and other countries, there are accomplices. This is a criminal act that endangers the security of our countries and all countries in Europe. It is the common task of all countries to make it impossible for German imperialism to do evil.

There are also other imperialist and militarist groups who are unwilling to lose the colonies from which they extract huge profits. The acts of suppression in the Congo, in Black Africa, the actions taken against the newly liberated Asian and African people, and first and foremost the years of war waged in Algeria, are proof of this. War must be stopped immediately through negotiations, and the right of the Algerian people to decide their own destiny must be truly recognized. Only by recognizing the independent rights of the people of colonial countries can new mutually beneficial relations be established between these countries and the former colonial powers.

The appeal calls on all working people and democrats in these countries to take joint action to strive for the earliest possible convening of a summit meeting and to achieve positive results; to resolve the German question through the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two German states, to strive for the recognition of the German Democratic Republic, and to resolve the West Berlin issue; to demand the cancellation of foreign military bases and missile launch sites in Central Europe, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe, and to establish zones in the above-mentioned areas that do not assume military obligations; to demand that the governments of those countries that still refuse to recognize the People's Republic of China recognize it and grant it its legitimate status in international organizations; and to strive for complete and thorough disarmament, first and foremost demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, the complete cessation of atomic weapons testing that poisons the atmosphere, and the cancellation of atomic tests planned in the Sahara that have already been condemned by the United Nations.

The appeal calls for full support for the initiatives of the world peace movement, and points out that the steps taken to ease the situation have shown that our past struggles have not been without effect. There must be no waiting. The struggle must be strengthened. We must gain greater confidence from the achievements we have made, believe in our own strength, in order to completely guarantee international peace and friendship between the people of all countries.

The appeal says that capitalist monopoly organizations and their agents use the "Cold War", and in some countries the spirit of chauvinism and colonialism, to attack the rights and freedoms of the people. Fascist dictatorships still exist in Spain and Portugal; the reactionary regime in Greece is persecuting democrats; and in Adenauer Germany, the Communist Party and other progressive and peace organizations are banned. In France, the authoritarian regime established last year has effectively abolished representative government and eliminated parliamentary democracy. Large banks and trusts everywhere – their strength is constantly growing – are only for their own benefit, and they attempt to strictly control the political life of our countries. The so-called supranational European organizations are new weapons in the hands of monopoly capital, which they use to more cruelly exploit the people of all countries and to limit the freedoms they have won in the course of generations of struggle.

From this it can be seen that the task before us is to make the struggle for democracy on a new and larger scale.

The cause of the people of Spain and Portugal, the cause of the people of Greece, is the common cause of all free people. We must help them in their struggle to establish political freedom and a system of leniency. Launch a broad movement to fight for the release of Manolis Glezos and his comrades, to fight for the restoration of freedom to Simon Sanchez Montero and for the implementation of an amnesty in Spain, to fight for an end to the illegal imprisonment of Alvaro Cunhal and to rescue other Portuguese political prisoners from torture chambers.

The appeal said that political persecution activities must be ended. Strive to get West Germany to revoke the ban on the activities of the heroic German Communist Party. Every political freedom and every right of the working people should be protected one by one, and at the same time, activities to restore democracy and strengthen democracy must be continuously strengthened, regardless of the obstruction of the enemies of democracy.

To this end, the appeal calls for a struggle for the universal democratization of social life in these countries, and says that the struggle for democracy now requires action to effectively limit the power of monopoly capital and prevent them from achieving dominance over the entire economic and political life. The appeal calls for the realization of: nationalization of certain monopolized parts of industry and democratization of the management institutions of the publicly owned part of the economy; giving play to the initiative of the working people and enabling them to participate in all aspects of economic life; implementing democratic supervision of investment in industry and agriculture; implementing land reform and protecting small farmers' ownership and other small and medium-sized producers from the plunder of monopoly organizations. The appeal points out: All these measures do not eliminate the phenomenon of man exploiting man. However, if they can be realized, they will limit the power and means of monopoly groups; they will increase the prestige and political influence of the working class in domestic life; they will help to isolate the most reactionary groups in society and help to forge an alliance between all progressive forces and all social strata who are victims of the activities of monopoly groups.

The appeal says that the struggle for peace and the activities for democratic reform are closely linked to the struggle to defend the vital interests of the working class and the legitimate demands of peasants, intellectuals, handicraftsmen, small businessmen, small industrialists, and other middle strata who are oppressed by the policies of big capital.

Of course, in our countries, living conditions are different, but monopoly organizations in all countries are trying to shift the burden of policies that require high costs to the working people. The privileged classes concentrate vast amounts of wealth in their own hands, while the exploitation of all laborers is becoming increasingly intensified. Although needs are constantly increasing, the material conditions of the broad masses of residents have not only not improved, but have even deteriorated in some cases, which overturns the illusions propagated about capitalism being able to change its own nature.

The appeal said that in our countries, no country guarantees full employment for residents, and in many of them, total and partial unemployment has remained at a very high level. Capitalism has shown that it is incapable of eliminating economically underdeveloped areas. Remnants of feudal-type relations are still preserved in the countryside in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, and other countries. The increasingly fierce penetration of financial capital in various countries has bankrupted more and more vast numbers of small and medium-sized property owners, constantly driving millions of rural laborers out of the land.

The appeal points out that due to the increasing concentration of capital, including on an international scale, this situation may become even more serious. The European Common Market and free trade zones are not only tools used by monopoly organizations to plunder the national economy of each country, but will also cause economic and trade wars between our countries, which are bound to worsen the material conditions of our people.

The appeal says that the working people can only rely on their own heroic struggles and constant resistance to limit the destructive consequences of this policy. The appeal calls on the working class of these countries to further unite their forces and fight for their common demands in the face of the alliance of monopoly organizations' interests.

The appeal points out that the economic division caused by the "Common Market" and the "free trade zone" must be ended. The trade discrimination against socialist countries in capitalist countries must be ended in order to establish genuine economic cooperation for all countries.

The appeal calls on the working people to unite their forces in order to actively fight against unemployment, strive for full employment of residents, strive for increased wages, strive for improved social insurance systems, and strive for equality of rights for women and working youth in various countries and on an international scale.

The appeal says that now more than ever, it is necessary to unite all the strength of the people. In order to ensure that the solution of the economic difficulties of our countries no longer only benefits monopoly organizations at the expense of the interests of the working masses, the working people and democrats must unite in struggle. In order to reject any reactionary solutions, in order to seek democratic solutions to the problems posed by the political development of our countries, it is necessary to unite. In order to make our countries' governments serve the cause of peace and no longer create obstacles to easing international tensions, it is also urgently needed to unite. The appeal calls on all those who firmly believe in progress and freedom, all working people of various faiths, working people who believe in Christianity and yearn to improve their living conditions, and their organizations, social parties and social democrats and their members, trade union members and cooperative members to unite in a common struggle.

The appeal says that now is not the time to make concessions to reactionary forces, now is the time when workers and democratic forces should unite.

The appeal says that the era in which we live is an era in which socialism demonstrates its superiority in all aspects of political, economic, and social life. The Communists firmly believe that under the current new conditions, the majority of the people in each of our countries will be able to find ways and means to unite and carry out the socialist transformation of society, and the prerequisite for socialist transformation is the working class and other working people seizing power.

At a moment of decisive significance for all mankind, our party once again contributes its strength to its own people and its own country.

This strength, they draw it from their loyalty to their own doctrine and the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Their unbreakable cooperation with all Communist Parties in the world, and first and foremost with the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has given them this strength. Our party is the defender of the interests of its own people, and determines its own policies in accordance with the conditions of each country. Our party is united by the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and the Communist and Workers' Parties solemnly reaffirmed this spirit in the declaration passed on the 40th anniversary of the glorious October Socialist Revolution.

The appeal concludes by saying that our party draws strength from the trust and support of its own people, and our party strives to better understand and defend the interests and aspirations of its own people, thereby gaining this trust and support.

Working people and democrats of European capitalist countries, please listen to the call of the Communists:

Let us all unite in the struggle for the victory of the cause of peace, for progress, for the reform of democracy, for the welfare of the working people, and for a happy future!

    西欧十七国共产党代表举行会议
    号召人民团结起来争取和平民主
    以美国为靠山的统治阶级企图把西欧变为冷战堡垒
    工人阶级应为共同利益而斗争决不向反动势力让步
    新华社7日讯　日内瓦消息：意大利共产党机关报“团结报”12月1日刊登了关于在罗马举行的欧洲十七个资本主义国家共产党代表会议的公报和这次会议所通过的告全体劳动人民和全体民主人士的呼吁书。参加这次会议的有奥地利共产党、比利时共产党、丹麦共产党、芬兰共产党、法国共产党、德国共产党、英国共产党、希腊共产党、意大利共产党、卢森堡共产党、荷兰共产党、挪威共产党、葡萄牙共产党、西班牙共产党、圣马力诺共和国共产党、瑞典共产党和瑞士劳动党的代表。
    会议公报说，根据葛兰西研究所的倡议，从11月21日到24日在罗马举行了研究欧洲资本主义发展问题的国际会议。在随后的几天，参加这个会议的欧洲资本主义国家的共产党代表就工人阶级和人民群众在争取和平、保卫和恢复民主、争取劳动人民的物质福利的斗争中的团结问题广泛地交换了意见，并且通过了告全体劳动人民和全体民主人士的呼吁书。
    呼吁书指出，向国际局势缓和的转变已经开始。苏联和社会主义阵营的所有国家的政策是以在许多方面已经取得的优势为依据的，并且完全服务于和平事业。这些良好的结果表明，二年前六十四个共产党和工人党呼吁各国人民坚决地、满怀信心地为和平事业而斗争的宣言的原则是多么正确。
    呼吁书指出了苏联关于全面和彻底裁军建议的巨大意义，并且说，在这个具有历史意义的关头，工人阶级、劳动人民和我们各国的人民负有重大的责任。
    呼吁书说，资本主义在我们各国深深地扎下了根。旨在奴役其他各洲人民的侵略经常是从我们大陆开始的。即使在今天，以美国最反动的集团为靠山的统治阶级还企图把欧洲的这个地区变成反动派的堡垒，他们仍然死死抱着大西洋公约的侵略政策。从“冷战”后果中获得直接利益的经济集团和把自己的政权建筑在保持“冷战”的基础上的政治势力，敌视紧张局势的缓和。呼吁书说，帝国主义和军国主义现在又在西德建立了自己的政权。在把原子武器交给他们之后，他们的侵略力量变得更加危险了。德国复仇主义者正在酝酿侵略德意志民主共和国的计划，并且对各个国家都有领土野心。他们在欧洲是和平的重要危险。在美国、法国、英国、意大利和其它国家的统治集团中，有他们的同谋者。这是危害我们这些国家和欧洲所有国家的安全的罪恶行为。使德国帝国主义没有可能去为非作歹，这是所有国家的共同任务。
    还有另外一些帝国主义和军国主义集团，他们不甘心失掉供他们榨取巨额利润的殖民地。在刚果、黑非洲所出现的镇压行为，对不久前刚获得解放的亚非人民所采取的行动，而首先是在阿尔及利亚进行了多年的战争，便是这方面的证明。必须立即通过谈判的途径停止战争，并且真正承认阿尔及利亚人民自己决定自己命运的权利。只有承认各殖民地国家人民的独立权利，才能在这些国家和前宗主国之间建立起新的互利关系。
    呼吁书号召这些国家的全体劳动人民和民主人士共同行动起来，争取最高级会议尽快召开，并取得积极的成果；争取通过同两个德国缔结和约的途径解决德国问题，争取承认德意志民主共和国，争取解决西柏林问题；要求取消在中欧、北欧和南欧的外国军事基地和火箭发射场，在上述地区建立不承担军事义务的区域；要求现在还拒绝承认中华人民共和国的那些国家的政府承认它，并且给予它在国际组织中的合法地位；争取全面和彻底的裁军，首先是要求禁止原子武器，彻底停止毒化大气层的原子武器试验，取消计划在撒哈拉进行的已经遭到联合国谴责的原子试验。
    呼吁书号召全力支持世界和平运动的倡议，并且指出，在缓和局势方面所采取的步骤已经表明，我们过去的斗争不是没有成效的。决不能等待。必须加强斗争。我们要从已取得的成就中获得更大的信心，相信自己的力量，以便彻底保证国际和平和各国人民之间的友谊。
    呼吁书说，资本主义垄断组织及其代理人利用“冷战”、而在某些国家是利用沙文主义和殖民主义精神来向人民的权利和自由进攻。在西班牙和葡萄牙仍然存在着法西斯独裁；希腊的反动政权在迫害民主人士；在阿登纳德国，共产党和其他进步与和平组织遭到禁止。在法国，去年建立的专权政权实际上是取消了代议制和消灭了议会民主。各地大银行和托辣斯——它们的实力在不断地增长——只是为了自己的利益，它们企图严格控制我们这些国家的政治生活。所谓超国家的欧洲组织是垄断资本手中的新武器，它们用这个武器来更残酷地剥削各国人民，来限制他们在世世代代的斗争过程中所争得的自由。
    由此可见，摆在我们面前的任务就是要使争取民主的斗争具有新的、更大的规模。
    西班牙和葡萄牙两国人民的事业、希腊人民的事业是全体自由人民的共同事业。在他们为争取建立政治自由和宽大的制度而进行的斗争中，我们要帮助他们。为争取释放曼诺里斯·格列索斯和他的同志们，为争取使西蒙·桑切斯·蒙特罗恢复自由和争取在西班牙实行大赦，为争取结束对阿耳瓦罗·库尼亚尔的非法监禁和从刑讯室里救出葡萄牙其他政治犯而展开一个广泛的运动。
    呼吁书说，必须结束政治迫害活动。争取使西德撤销禁止英勇的德国共产党活动的禁令。每一项政治自由和劳动人民的每一项权利都应当逐一地得到保护，同时，必须不管民主敌人的阻挠，不断地加强争取恢复民主和加强民主的活动。
    为此，呼吁书号召为在这些国家实行社会生活普遍民主化而斗争，并且说，争取民主的斗争现在要求行动起来，有效地限制垄断资本的权力，阻止它们实现对整个经济和政治生活的统治。呼吁书要求实现：对工业中某些垄断部分实行国有化和使经济公有部分的管理机构民主化；发挥劳动人民的主动性和使他们参预各方面的经济生活；对工农业中的投资实行民主监督；实行土地改革和保护小农所有制及其他中小生产者，使它们不受垄断组织的掠夺。呼吁书指出：这一切措施并未消除人剥削人的现象。但是，如果它们得以实现，它们就会限制垄断集团的权力和手段；就会提高工人阶级在国内生活中的威信和政治影响；就会促使社会上最反动的集团陷于孤立并有助于作为垄断集团活动的牺牲者的全体进步力量和所有社会阶层结成联盟。
    呼吁书说，争取和平的斗争，争取民主革新的活动是同保卫工人阶级的切身利益和农民、知识分子、手工业者、小商人、小工业家以及受大资本的政策压迫的其他中等阶层的正当要求的斗争紧密相联的。
    当然，在我们这些国家里，生活条件是不同的，但是，各国垄断组织都企图把需要付出高昂代价的政策的负担转嫁给劳动人民。特权阶层把大量财富集中在自己的手中，同时对于所有劳动者的剥削日益变本加厉。尽管需要不断地增长，广大居民阶层的物质状况不但没有改善，在某些情况下反而恶化了，这推翻了所宣扬的关于资本主义能够改变它自己的本质的幻想。
    呼吁书说，在我们这些国家里，没有一个国家保证了居民的全部就业，其中有很多国家的全失业和半失业一直保持在很高的水平上。资本主义表明它没有能力消灭经济上不发达的地区。在意大利、西班牙、葡萄牙、希腊和其他国家的农村中还保留着封建类型关系的残余。各国金融资本日益激烈的渗透使越来越多的广大的中小有产者破产，把千百万农村劳动者不断赶出土地。
    呼吁书指出，由于资本的日益增长的集中，其中包括在国际范围内，这种情况就可能变得更加严重。欧洲共同市场、自由贸易区不仅是垄断组织用来掠夺每个国家的民族经济的工具，而且也将引起我们这些国家之间的经济战和贸易战，这势必使我们人民的物质状况恶化。
    呼吁书说，劳动人民只有依靠自己英勇的斗争，不断的反抗，才能限制这种政策的毁灭性的后果。呼吁书号召这些国家的工人阶级进一步团结自己的力量，在垄断组织利益的联盟面前为自己的共同要求而奋斗。
    呼吁书指出，必须结束“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”所导致的经济分裂。必须结束在资本主义国家对社会主义国家的贸易歧视，以便建立所有国家的真正的经济合作。
    呼吁书号召劳动人民团结自己的力量，以便在各国和在国际范围内积极地为反对失业、争取居民完全就业、争取增加工资、争取改善社会保险制度、争取妇女和劳动青年权利的平等而斗争。
    呼吁书说，现在比任何时候都更需要团结人民的全部力量。为了使我们这些国家的经济困难的解决不再只有利于垄断组织而牺牲劳动群众利益，劳动人民和民主人士必须在斗争中团结起来。为了拒绝任何反动的解决办法，为了使我们国家的政治发展所提出的问题求得民主的解决办法，必须团结起来。为了使我们国家的政府服务于和平事业，不再对缓和国际紧张局势制造障碍，也迫切需要团结起来。呼吁书号召一切坚信进步和自由的人们、持有各种信仰的全体劳动人民、相信基督教而渴望改善生活条件的劳动人民以及他们的组织、社会党和社会民主党及其党员、工会会员和合作社社员们，在共同的斗争中团结起来。
    呼吁书说，现在不是向反动势力让步的时候，现在是工人和民主力量应该团结起来的时候。
    呼吁书说，我们生活的时代，是社会主义在政治、经济和社会生活的所有方面显示出自己的优越性的时代。共产党人坚信，在当前的新条件下，我们每一个国家的大多数人民必能找到团结起来和对社会进行社会主义改造的途径和方式，而社会主义改造的前提是工人阶级和其他劳动人民掌握政权。
    在对全人类具有决定意义的时刻，我们的党再一次为自己的人民和自己的国家贡献自己的力量。
    这种力量，他们是取之于对自己的学说和马克思列宁主义原则的忠诚。它们同世界上所有的共产党实行牢不可破的合作，而首先是同伟大的苏联共产党的合作，给了它们这种力量。我们的党是本国人民的利益的捍卫者，并根据每个国家的条件确定自己的政策，我们的党是由无产阶级国际主义的精神团结在一起的，共产党和工人党在光荣的十月社会主义革命四十周年之际所通过的宣言中庄严地重申了这一精神。
    呼吁书最后说，我们的党从本国人民的信任和拥护中汲取力量，我们的党力求更好地了解和捍卫本国人民的利益和他们的愿望，从而取得这种信任和支持。
    欧洲资本主义国家的劳动人民和民主人士们，请倾听共产党人的号召：
    在争取和平事业的胜利、争取进步、争取革新民主、争取劳动人民的福利和争取幸福的未来的斗争中我们大家团结起来！
