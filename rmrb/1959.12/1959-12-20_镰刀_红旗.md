　　Sickle · Red Flag

　　Sickle
　　Early morning, the mist on the distant mountains has not yet dissipated, the dew on the grass leaves has not yet woken up... The captain leads the sickle back, and a group of young people surround it. In an instant, a burst of noise and laughter, accompanied by the morning breeze, drifted towards the golden fields.
　　What a good sickle, as beautiful as a crescent moon, shining with blue light, the beige handle still exudes the fragrance of new wood, all brand new!
　　This sickle was made by our commune's farm tool factory. Master Zhang in the factory is an old blacksmith! In order to welcome the autumn harvest, he led a blacksmith team and worked hard for three days. This is their most precious gift to the great harvest.
　　Sickle, this contains the sweat of our great steelmaking campaign. At this time last year, we climbed countless mountains for mining and logging, and spent countless boiling nights beside the blazing blast furnaces. Today, the fruits of our labor are blossoming. If you knock on this sickle, how clear the sound!
　　What a good sickle, it encountered a bumper harvest of late rice as soon as it was born. It's time to show off your skills! Take this brand new, sharp sickle and participate in the tense and joyful autumn harvest!

　　Red Flag
　　In the golden sea of rice, a red flag is flying high. How bright! It attracts the eyes of countless harvesters and excites the hearts of every commune member.
　　This is a red flag awarded to the harvesting vanguard team. During the autumn harvest, whichever team harvests the most, the fastest, the best, and the most economically, the red flag will be planted there. This is a symbol of victory, the highest reward, and the greatest honor!
　　Yesterday morning, the red flag was planted in the girls' team. The girls were so happy that they forgot to rest and harvested seven mu of rice in one breath. In less than half a day, the red flag was snatched away by the young men. Now, it is flying in the field harvested by Uncle Zhang's team again. This afternoon, I don't know who will take the red flag away again.
　　Look, this victorious red flag, draped in golden sunshine, dances so happily in the autumn wind mixed with the fragrance of rice! It encourages the enthusiasm of the commune members, boils the blood of the commune members, and, with the joyful hearts of the commune members, accompanied by the rustling sound of the sickle, directs the entire golden field to sing the song of harvest...

    镰刀·红旗
    刘海文　冯志荣
    镰刀
    清晨，远山的薄雾还没有散尽，草叶上的露珠还没有睡醒……队长领镰刀回来了，一群年轻人围了上去。顷刻间，一阵闹声、笑语，伴着晨风向金色的田野飘散开去。
    多好的镰刀呀，像弯月般秀丽，闪着蓝色的光，米黄色的柄子还散发着新木的香气，全是崭新崭新的呀！
    这镰刀是我们公社的农具厂造的。厂里的张师傅是老铁匠啦！为了迎接秋收，他领导一个铁工小组，突击了三天，这是他们献给大丰收的最珍贵的礼物。
    镰刀，这里面凝聚着我们大炼钢铁的汗水。去年这个时候，我们为采矿、伐木，爬过多少高山，又在火光熊熊的高炉旁，度过了多少个沸腾的夜晚。今天，我们的劳动果实，开出花来了。你敲敲这镰刀，声音多么清脆！
    多好的镰刀呀，它一出世就碰上了晚稻的特大丰收。该显显本领啦！拿着这崭新、锋利的镰刀，去参加紧张而又欢愉的秋收吧！红　旗在金色的稻海中，高高地飘着一面红旗。多么鲜艳呵！它吸引着无数收割者的眼，激动着每一个社员的心。
    这是一面奖给收割先锋队的红旗。在秋收中，哪个队割得最多最快最好最省，红旗就插到哪里。这是胜利的象征，这是最高的奖赏，也是最大的荣誉！
    昨天上午，红旗插在姑娘们的小队里，姑娘们乐得忘了休息，一口气割完了七亩禾。不到半天，红旗被小伙子夺去了。现在，它又飘扬在张二叔小队收割的田间。下午，红旗不知又会被谁夺去。
    你看，这胜利的红旗，披着金灿灿的阳光，在掺和着稻香的秋风里，飘舞得多欢！它鼓舞着社员的干劲，烧沸了社员的血液，带着社员们喜悦的心，伴着沙沙的镰声，指挥整个金色的田野唱起丰收之歌……。
