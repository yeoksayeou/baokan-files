　　Cutting Away the Two Minds
　　Ge De

　　Some comrades are often troubled by having “two minds.” One mind is toward the Party, toward the collective and the people, toward socialism and communism. The other mind, however, often comes to entangle them, this mind being toward selfishness and capitalism, and constantly pulling these comrades away from the Party, from the collective, and from socialism. Thus, in these comrades, a situation of "two minds contending" often arises. Their relationship with the Party is sometimes close and sometimes distant, and individualistic emotions appear and disappear intermittently, until the latter mind is cut away, and only one mind is in charge. The mind towards good, it is said, “everyone has it.” Especially those who have already dedicated themselves to the revolution but have failed to cut off the two minds, mostly have the desire to get rid of the suffering of having two minds. However, only this desire is not enough. The question is how to actively cut off the two minds, and what attitude to take towards this?

　　There is a story in *Journey to the West* about "cutting off the two minds": Sun Wukong, because of his pride and arrogance and violating his master's teachings, broke the precepts and killed people twice, thus suffering expulsion. After being expelled, resentment arose, and he had the idea of giving up. As soon as the two minds arose, a Six-Eared Macaque transformed into Sun Wukong, beat Tang Seng, snatched the baggage and official documents, and transformed into a Tang Seng and his disciples, preparing to go to the Western Paradise to swindle the scriptures. Later, Sun Wukong went to subdue him, and after a fierce battle, from heaven to earth, from the South Sea to the Western Paradise, the Buddha revealed the truth: this Six-Eared Macaque was the embodiment of Sun Wukong's two minds. Only then did Sun Wukong kill him.

　　This story gives us the inspiration that we should learn from Sun Wukong's spirit of daring to fight and completely break with the two minds.

　　First, he dares to face mistakes and never avoids struggle. As soon as he sees this "two minds," he immediately wrestles fiercely with it. Even though he is exhausted, he refuses to give up until it is cut off. This is the most important point. If a person has two minds coexisting, it means that the two minds are almost evenly matched. Therefore, in the process of "two minds contending," even with the sharp weapons of Marxism-Leninism and criticism and self-criticism, victory cannot be easily obtained. Because the other mind also has its own "golden cudgel" for protection. Ideological struggle is also a difficult battle, and one must not attempt to stop after a little fight and then easily get through. If so, one will be deceived by the illusion of victory, allowing the two minds to take the opportunity to sneak into the vital organs, making it even more difficult to eliminate. And there are often people who are afraid of hard fighting.

　　Second, because he cannot win alone, he is not afraid to go to heaven and earth, seek Bodhisattvas, and pray to Buddhas, in order to get help from others. The two minds are indeed often intertwined, making it difficult to subdue them with one's own strength alone. Therefore, when mistakes occur, they should be opened up, and regardless of what is "true or false," the whole thing should be shaken out, welcoming everyone to help identify and capture them. More importantly, do not protect the pain. Guanyin Bodhisattva and Tang Seng both recited the "tightening spell" in order to distinguish between the real and fake Sun Wukong. Sun Wukong, who was struggling with the two minds, was willing to endure this headache, because he not only knew Guanyin and Tang Seng's bodhisattva hearts, but also understood that this was very necessary in the process of distinguishing between the real and fake. Most of our comrades can take a welcoming attitude towards sharp criticism in criticism and self-criticism, welcoming everyone to trace the roots and ask the bottom line. But there are also a few people who are heavily guarded against others' criticism, suspecting that others' bodhisattva hearts are malicious, fearing that others will dig up their pain, and even less willing to dig it out themselves. They always hope that criticism can be like scratching an itch through boots, and never like acupuncture. If others can stroke his back and comfort him with gentle words like singing a lullaby, so that he can sleep comfortably and peacefully, and when he wakes up, he will be brand new again, and he will be a perfect person; this is the most ideal. This is a coward's fantasy, and the result can only be to indulge mistakes and harm oneself.

　　Third, once he sees the true face of the Six-Eared Macaque, he "swings the iron rod and strikes it to death," so that the macaque "is extinct to this day." What a decisive break with mistakes. Marxists demand that they dare to break with all old consciousness. Most of our comrades can treat their mistakes so strictly. But some people, even though they know where the mistakes are, still cannot bear to strike. Some people even "hate it when they see it, but miss it when they don't see it." Even if they strike, they only brush it lightly, for fear of killing the species, so they often leave behind evil roots, which can lead to endless trouble.

　　Of course, Sun Wukong cannot be completely regarded as a revolutionary of today. But his attitude towards the two minds is indeed very bold. Under the teaching of the Party and Chairman Mao, many of our comrades are of course far more outstanding than Sun Wukong in their serious and earnest critical attitude towards their mistakes and their thorough break with their mistakes. However, those cowards who take a warm, tolerant, weak, and even protective attitude towards their mistakes should feel ashamed when facing this story. Even if these comrades have a little intention to cut off the two minds, that intention is faint, vague, not thorough and real enough, so they cannot withstand the test of struggle; to put it bluntly, it is because their selfishness is too heavy and they have too many personal plans. They should also use the spirit of Sun Wukong to encourage themselves. As for those who wholeheartedly oppose the Party, they originally harbor another mind, and even "two minds" are not enough to talk about, so they are naturally another matter.

### 剪除二心

　　剪除二心
　　葛德
    有一些同志，常常为“二心”所苦。一条心向着党，向着集体和人民，向着社会主义和共产主义。另一条心却又常常来纠缠，这条心向着自私自利、向着资本主义，而且不断把这些同志从党、从集体、从社会主义的身边拉开去。于是，在这些同志身上，时常出现“二心竞斗”的局面。他们对党的关系若即若离，个人主义情绪时隐时现。直到剪除了后一条心，只由一心主事时为止。向善之心“人皆有之”的吧。特别是已经献身于革命而又未能剪断二心的人，多是有着摆脱二心之苦的意愿的。但是，只有这种意愿还不行，问题在于如何积极地去剪断二心，在于对这采取什么态度？
    西游记上有一个“剪断二心”的故事：孙悟空由于恃功骄傲，违背了师父的教训，两次破戒杀人，因此遭到逐斥，被逐之后又由怨艾产生了撒手不干的念头。二心一生，顿时便有一个六耳猕猴变作孙悟空的模样，打坏了唐僧，抢去了包裹、关文，另化出唐僧师徒四众，准备到西天骗取真经。后来孙悟空去降伏他，经过一场恶斗，从天上打到地下，从南海打到西天，后来如来佛点破了真相，原来这个六耳猕猴就是孙悟空二心的化身，这才由孙悟空把它打杀了。
    这个故事给我们的启发是：应该学习孙悟空对于二心勇于斗争和彻底决绝的精神。
    第一，他敢于面对错误，决不回避斗争。一见这个“二心”之后，立即狠命相扑。尽管打得筋疲力竭，不到剪除时也不肯罢手。这一点最为要紧。一个人如果是二心并存，就说明这二心之间差不多是势均力敌的。所以在“二心竞斗”的过程中，尽管有马克思列宁主义思想和批评自我批评的锐利武器，也不是可以轻易获得胜利的。因为那另一条心也有自己的“金箍棒”作护身。思想斗争，也是艰苦的搏战，决不能企图稍作相搏便罢手，然后就轻轻松松地过关。如果这样，便要被胜利的假象所惑，使二心趁机潜入膏肓，更难剪灭了。而怕作苦搏的人，往往是有的。
    第二，由于独力难胜，他便不怕上天入地，求菩萨，告佛祖，以求得别人的帮助。二心这种东西，的确常是真真假假纠缠不清，仅仅凭自己的力量，是难于降服它的。所以有了错误，就应该敞开来，不管“真真假假”，连底抖出来，欢迎大家来帮助识别擒拿。更重要的是，千万不要护痛。观世音菩萨和唐僧，为了分清真假孙悟空，都曾念过“紧箍咒”。正在与二心苦斗的孙悟空，愿意承受这种头痛，因为他不仅深知观世音和唐僧的菩萨心肠；而且也懂得这在分清真假的过程中是十分必要的。我们的多数同志，在批评自我批评中都能对尖锐的批评采取欢迎的态度，欢迎大家寻根问底的追究。但也有少数人对别人的批评戒备森严，把别人一副菩萨心肠疑作恶意，生怕别人来挖自己的痛处，自己更不肯忍痛自挖。总是希望批评能像隔靴搔痒，千万不要如针刺肤。如果别人能够抚着他的脊背，像唱催眠曲一样来温言劝慰，使他能够舒舒服服地安然睡去，等一觉醒来，便面目一新，又是一个完人了；这就最合理想。这是懦夫的幻想，其结果只能是纵容错误害了自己。
    第三，当他一旦看清六耳猕　的真面目以后，就“抡起铁棒，劈头一下打死”，使那猕猴“至今绝此一种”。这对错误是何等决绝。马克思主义者正是要求自己勇于同一切旧的意识决绝的。我们的多数同志都能这样严格对待自己的错误。但也有些人，虽然已知错误所在，却还不忍下手。甚至有的人是“见了又恨它，不见了反想它”。即使是打，也只是轻拂一二，唯恐打绝了种，因此也就常常留下孽根，后患无穷。
    自然不能把孙悟空完全看成一个今天的革命者。但他对二心的这种态度，的确很有点气魄。我们许多同志，在党和毛主席的教导下，对自己的错误，批判态度之严肃认真，同自己错误决绝之彻底，当然远比当年的孙悟空更为出色。但是，那些对待自己错误采取温情、姑息、软弱，甚而至于护持的懦夫们，面对这个故事，应该是问心有愧的。这些同志，即使有着一点剪除二心的意愿，那意愿也是淡微的，模模糊糊的，不够彻底和真实的，因此便经不起斗争的考验；揭穿来说还是由于他们的私心太重，个人打算太多，他们还应当以孙悟空这种精神来激励自己。至于那些一心一意同党作对的人，他们本来安的是另外一条心，连“二心”也还谈不到，自然是另作别论的了。
