Title: Misty Mountain Rain

The rain fell harder and harder. The verdant mountains and tender green trees were all shrouded in mist. In the rain, a large cart laden with rice bran and fattening pig feed moved forward laboriously. The old man driving the cart kept cracking his whip and shouting at the animals. Two young men followed behind the cart, both carrying Red Cross medicine chests. The rain drenched all three of them, but they continued to gesture and talk and laugh.

Suddenly, from the woods in a mountain hollow ahead, a loud voice rang out:

"You're killing me with worry!"

All three were startled. They looked up and, lo and behold, it was Management Area Director Wang! He was wearing two or three raincoats and rushing over excitedly with a long-handled iron shovel in his hand. The old man was a natural comedian. Seeing Director Wang leap out, he teased him: "Ha! It's you! I thought it was Lu Zhishen, the Flowery Monk who made a scene in the Wild Boar Forest back in the day!"

Director Wang didn't answer, but rushed up and put the raincoats on them one by one. Then he grasped the hands of the two young men, "There's a muddy puddle on the road ahead. I've been filling it in, or I would have come to meet you sooner. You've really worked hard, comrades!"

"Hey," the old man tightened his raincoat, rounded his wet eyes, and looked at the two young men and said: "Lao Qian, Lao Shen, that's him, the two or three hundred...haha, the father of two or three hundred mothers!" Director Wang knew that this comedian must have been talking about him just now, so he simply said, "That's right! What about it?"

It turned out that the management area's thirty-odd sows had given birth to two or three hundred piglets more than ten days ago. Director Wang was overjoyed: The Party calls for vigorously developing animal husbandry, and this time we must take good care of them and keep every single one alive. Director Wang put in a lot of effort, sending a cart specifically to haul feed for the pigs. And, from the day they were born, he mixed with the pigs, providing extra care and feeding. It was because of his concern for the piglets that people often deliberately joked with him.

Last night, he discovered that some of the piglets were sick. But the veterinarian from the management area who had gone out for training had not returned, so he had to ask the old cart driver to invite two veterinarians from the town.

The cart arrived at the muddy puddle. Ha! A large pool of water had been filled with layers of tangled branches and clumps of mud! The old man nimbly jumped onto the cart and cracked his whip. Director Wang, Lao Qian, and Lao Shen all rolled up their trouser legs and pushed from behind. After a flurry of activity, the cart passed safely. The old man jumped off the cart, his face full of smiles, and praised, "This is Director Wang's achievement! Director Wang's achievement!" Director Wang wiped the rain from his face and said, panting, to the two veterinarians: "This is a damn place. It's fine when it's dry, but it's no good when it rains. When I have time in the future, I must build a bridge!"

The rain continued to fall, and the mountains became even more misty. The wheels of the cart turned in the muddy water, splashing mud from time to time.

"Lao Shen, Lao Qian! Look, the scenery in these mountains is so beautiful! Ha? Listen, what's that sound?" Director Wang pricked up his ears and listened.

In the distance, there were faint shouts, the neighing of horses, and the sound of voices. They could only hear fragments:

"...Don't mention it! I searched all morning and couldn't find him. I was so worried! This child has a hard life! He lost his parents when he was five or six years old and was put to herding pigs for that stinky-nosed Zhang. He worked hard from dawn till dusk, scared and crying... Now he's finally made it. But he's too busy, running around all day,... doesn't he know you're sick?"

A woman's faint voice answered, but it was not clear.

In the misty mountain rain, the two carts were very close, and they spoke to each other:

"Which unit's cart is that?" Director Wang asked.

"Red Star! Where are you from?"

"Ah! It's Uncle Sun! Where are you going in such heavy rain?"

"You! Little Wang Gang! You made me search so hard! Quickly, take a look in the cart!" Uncle Sun's face was full of rain, and his black beard moved. Director Wang didn't know what was going on and hurriedly walked to the front of the cart, which had a canopy. Ha, lying inside was his wife! The woman said she had been feeling unwell since early this morning and was going to the town to see a doctor.

Director Wang grabbed Uncle Sun's hand: "Uncle, Uncle! Thanks to you..."

"It's nothing, just take more care of your family in the future."

"I've been really busy these days and haven't been home. Uncle! Why didn't you get treatment at our management area's clinic?"

"I asked the doctor to go to your house to see her. The doctor said that the medicine and equipment were incomplete and she had to go to town."

When Lao Shen and Lao Qian heard that there was a patient, they also hurried over to greet them. The old cart driver grumbled to the side: "You, really! What if something goes wrong? You should accompany her to town to see a doctor."

Director Wang said to Uncle Sun: "How about this, you go ahead and I'll go back and arrange things and then take a shortcut to the town." "Don't worry, I'll be responsible for taking your wife there and taking good care of her." Uncle Sun laughed, cracked his whip, and drove the animals off. Director Wang and the others also hurried back. At this time, the rain stopped. The sun came out, and a colorful rainbow appeared in the sky.

    山雨濛濛
    程俊
    雨越下越大。青翠的山，嫩绿的树，都变得雾蒙蒙的。雨中，一辆大车满载着米糠和肥猪粉吃力地往前移动着。赶车的老头不住地挥着大鞭，吆喝着牲口。车后跟着两个青年人，都背着红十字药箱。雨把他们三人浇的湿透，但他们还在比划着，谈笑着。
    忽然，前面山凹处的树林里，传来了宏亮的声音：
    “你们可把我急死啦！”
    三个人都大吃一惊。抬头一看，呵，原来是管理区王主任！只见他披着两三件雨衣，手里拿把长杆铁锹兴冲冲地奔过来。老头是个天生的滑稽鬼，他见王主任一跃而出，便逗起来：“哈呀！是你！我寻思是当年大闹野猪林的花和尚鲁智深呢！”
    王主任没答话，一个劲奔上来，把雨衣一件一件地披到他们身上。接着握住那两个年青人的手，“前面路上有个洼泥塘，我垫了垫，要不早迎过来了。真是太辛苦啦，同志！”
    “喂”老头紧了紧雨衣，瞪圆了湿呼呼的眼睛，望着那两个青年人说：“老钱、老沈，就是他，那二三百个……哈哈，二三百个的妈妈！”王主任知道方才这滑稽鬼一定在谈论自己，就索性说：“就是！你又怎么着？”
    原来管理区三十多头母猪十多天前下了二三百小猪崽。王主任乐坏了：党号召大力发展畜牧饲养业，这回可得好好侍弄侍弄，下一个活一个才行。王主任下了工夫，派了一挂车专门给猪拉饲料。并且，从下崽那天起，他就和猪混上了，加倍照料和喂养。也就是因为他对小猪这样关切，人们才常常故意跟他逗笑。
    昨天晚上，他发现有几个小猪崽病了。可是管理区出去受训的兽医没有回来，所以，只得叫赶车老头把镇上的两名兽医请来。
    车到了泥塘。呵！好大一片水洼子都被一层乱枝一层泥块垫起来了！老头敏捷地跳上了车，挥起大鞭。王主任和老钱老沈都挽起了裤脚在后面推。一阵忙碌之后，车安稳地走了过去。老头跳下车满面带笑地直夸奖：“这是王主任的功劳！王主任的功劳！”王主任抹了一下脸上的雨水气喘吁吁地对那两个兽医说：“这才是个熊地方呢，干天垫的好好的，一到雨天，就不成了。将来有功夫，一定得修座桥！”
    雨仍下个不止，山变得越发迷蒙起来，车轮在泥水中转动着，不时地溅起泥浆。
    “老沈，老钱！你们看，这山上的景致多美！呵？你们听，什么声音？”王主任竖起耳朵倾听起来。
    远处，传来了隐隐的吆喝声、马嘶声和格楞格楞的说话声，只断断续续地听得：
      “……别提啦！我找了一早晨也没找到他，把我都急坏啦！这孩子命苦啊！五六岁死了爹娘就给张臭鼻子放猪，起早贪黑，连吓带哭…现在可熬出头了。只是太忙了，成天东跑西颠，……他就不知道你病了吗？”
    一个女人的轻微的声音答着话，但听不清楚。
    在蒙蒙的山雨中，两辆车已离得很近了，彼此搭了话：
    “哪的车？”王主任问。
    “红星！你是哪的？”
    “啊！是孙大叔！这么大的雨上那去？”
    “你呀！小王纲！你让我找的好苦！快往车上看看吧！”孙大叔满脸是雨水，黑胡须一动一动的。王主任不知是怎么回事，慌忙走到那搭有车棚的车厢跟前一看，呵，里面躺的竟是自己的老婆！女人说她一早起来就不舒服，现在正要到镇上去看病。
    王主任拉住孙大叔的手：“大叔，大叔！多亏了你”
    “没啥，往后多关照家就是了。”
    “我这几天实在忙，没回家去。大叔！怎么不在咱管理区卫生所治？”
    “我把大夫请到你家去看过啦，大夫说药和器具不全，非上镇不可。”
    老沈老钱听说有病人，也赶忙过来招呼。赶车老头却在一旁咕嘟：“你这人，真是！她要出个一差二错的可咋办？你还是陪她上镇瞧病吧。”
    王主任对孙大叔说：“这样吧，你先送着前边走，我回去安排一下马上抄近道赶到镇上去。”“你放心，我负责把你媳妇送到，负责照护好。”孙大叔哈哈笑着，把鞭子一扬，赶着牲口得得地走了。王主任他们也急急往回赶路。这时，雨停了。太阳钻了出来，天空里出现了一道五光十色的彩虹。（附图片）
