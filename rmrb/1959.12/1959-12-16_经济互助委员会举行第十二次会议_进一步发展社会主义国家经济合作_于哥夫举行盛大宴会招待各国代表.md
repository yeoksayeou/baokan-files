    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 14th December: The twelfth session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) was held in Sofia from December 10th to 14th.

    Delegations from eight member countries of the Council, namely Albania, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, participated in the meeting. Representatives from China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Mongolian People's Republic also attended the meeting as observers.

    The meeting discussed the further development of economic mutual assistance among socialist countries, including further specialization and collaboration in the machine manufacturing sector, the development of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, increasing fruit and vegetable production, and developing rail and sea transportation. The meeting also discussed a draft charter for the Council.

    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 14th December: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria, Yugov, held a grand banquet here on the 14th to entertain the delegates from various countries attending the twelfth session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.

    Present at the banquet were the delegations from the eight member countries participating in the meeting and the representatives from various countries attending the meeting as observers.

    Bulgarian party and government leaders Boyan Bulgaranov, Ivan Mikhailov, Encho Staykov, Georgi Traykov, and others attended the banquet. Diplomatic envoys from socialist countries to Bulgaria also attended the banquet.

    In his speech at the banquet, Yugov said that it must be noted with satisfaction that there was complete agreement on the discussion and resolution of various very important issues at this meeting. This meeting shows that the mutual relations between socialist countries have entered a new stage.

    Yugov said that some of the important issues discussed at the meeting in themselves illustrate the nature of the mutual relations between socialist countries and the role of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. This shows that the division of labor among the countries of the socialist camp is becoming more specific. This division of labor is an important condition for their rapid development along the socialist and communist path.

    Yugov said that it must be pointed out that the issues discussed at the twelfth session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance are not only of great significance for further consolidating the mutual relations between socialist countries, but their significance has gone beyond the scope of the socialist camp. In accordance with the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence, the draft charter of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, which was discussed at this meeting, stipulates that the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is an open organization, and other European countries can also join the organization if they agree with the principles and aims of the Council. This demonstrates the willingness of socialist countries to conduct sincere cooperation with other non-socialist countries on the basis of mutual benefit, equality and non-interference in internal affairs. This particularly reflects the essence of the policy of peaceful coexistence and equal economic cooperation pursued by socialist countries.

    Yugov finally said that the twelfth session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is a contribution to the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, understanding and cooperation.

    The head of the Polish delegation participating in this meeting, Deputy Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers Jaroszewicz, then spoke. On behalf of all the delegates attending the meeting, he expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian government for their warm reception and care.

    经济互助委员会举行第十二次会议
    进一步发展社会主义国家经济合作
    于哥夫举行盛大宴会招待各国代表
    新华社索非亚14日电　经济互助委员会第十二次会议，10日到14日在索非亚举行。
    参加会议的有阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、德意志民主共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联、匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克等八个委员会成员国的代表团。中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和蒙古人民共和国的代表也以观察员身份出席了会议。
    会议讨论了进一步发展社会主义国家间经济互助的问题，其中包括使机器制造业部门进一步专业化和协作、发展黑色和有色冶金业、增加水果和蔬菜生产、发展铁路和海上运输等。会议还讨论了委员会章程草案。
    新华社索非亚14日电　保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫14日在这里举行盛大宴会，招待出席经济互助委员会第十二次会议的各国代表。
    出席宴会的有参加这次会议的八个委员会成员国代表团和以观察员身份出席会议的各国代表。
    保加利亚党和政府领导人博扬·布尔加拉诺夫、伊凡·米哈伊洛夫、恩乔·斯塔伊科夫、格奥尔基·特莱科夫等出席了宴会。出席宴会的还有社会主义国家驻保加利亚的外交使节。
    于哥夫在宴会上讲话时说，必须满意地指出，在这次会议上，讨论和解决各种十分重要的问题时，意见是完全一致的。这次会议表明，社会主义各国间的相互关系已进入了一个新的阶段。
    于哥夫说，会议讨论的一些重要问题本身就说明了社会主义各国间相互关系的性质和经济互助委员会的作用。这表明，社会主义阵营各国间的劳动分工越来越具体了。这种劳动分工是它们沿着社会主义和共产主义道路迅速发展的一个重要条件。
    于哥夫说，必须指出，经济互助委员会第十二次会议讨论的问题，不仅对进一步巩固社会主义各国间的相互关系有重大意义，它的意义已超出了社会主义阵营的范围。根据关于和平共处的列宁主义原则，在这次会议上讨论的经济互助委员会章程草案中规定，经济互助委员会是一个公开组织，如果其它欧洲国家赞同委员会的原则和宗旨，也可以参加这个组织。这就表现了社会主义国家愿意同其它非社会主义国家在互利、平等和不干涉内政的基础上，进行真诚合作的愿望。这特别反映了社会主义各国奉行的和平共处和平等的经济合作政策的本质。
    于哥夫最后说，经济互助委员会第十二次会议是对各国人民争取和平、谅解和合作的斗争的一个贡献。
    参加这次会议的波兰代表团团长、波兰部长会议副主席雅罗谢维奇接着讲话。他代表出席这次会议的全体代表，衷心感谢保共中央和保加利亚政府的热情接待和关怀。
