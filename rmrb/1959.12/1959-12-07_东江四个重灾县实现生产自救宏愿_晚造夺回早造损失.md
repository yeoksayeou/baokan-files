Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 6th: The four counties in the Dongjiang area of Guangdong Province that suffered the most severe flooding in June—Huiyang, Boluo, Zengcheng, and Dongguan—have had a bumper late rice harvest. After the floods, the heroic people of these four counties continuously overcame three instances of waterlogging and two months of drought, realizing the bold slogan of "recovering losses from the early rice harvest with the late rice harvest." Significant achievements have also been made in the reconstruction of homes in the disaster areas, with some villages already "showing new villages instead of traces of disaster."

The total late rice planting area in these four counties this year was 3.2 million mu, an increase of 700,000 mu compared to the same period last year. By mid-November, when the late rice harvest began, except for 90,000 mu that suffered reduced yields or crop failure due to waterlogging and 40,000 mu that suffered severely from drought, the rest achieved a bumper harvest. By the end of November, 2.93 million mu had been harvested, with unit area yields significantly higher than the great leap forward of last year. Huiyang County stood out the most, with an average yield per mu increasing by more than 50% compared to last year's late rice harvest. Dongguan County increased by more than 30%, while Boluo and Zengcheng Counties, while slightly less, also increased by more than 20% and 10% respectively compared to last year. Because the planting area was larger than last year, the total late rice production of the four counties increased by a higher proportion.

The economic crops in these four counties have also recovered to the level of the same period last year; the number of chickens, ducks, and geese has increased nearly twofold compared to before the flood; the number of live pigs has increased by 30,000; and other sideline income has increased by one to two times compared to the same period last year.

In terms of rebuilding homes, the past few months were the busy farming season, not a time for large-scale construction, but great achievements were still made. By the end of November, the four counties had built more than 33,000 new houses and repaired more than 29,000, totaling 63,000 houses, which is about half of the 124,000 houses that should be built. The houses that were washed away by the great flood in June were mud houses, but the new houses being built are brick houses, and most of them are equipped with glass windows.

In mid-June, the Dongjiang River experienced a once-in-a-century flood. Huiyang, Boluo, Zengcheng, and Dongguan counties, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Dongjiang River, suffered severe flooding. At that time, the early rice on 1.3 million mu in these four counties was submerged and lost, 120,000 houses were destroyed, and more than 100 natural villages were turned into ruins; other things such as water conservancy projects, animal husbandry, economic crops, farm implements, and property all suffered extremely serious losses. After July, during the growth period of the late rice, they suffered three severe waterloggings in the early stage, submerging 390,000 mu of late rice, and then suffered a continuous two-month drought in the later stage, affecting 580,000 mu of farmland. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the superior conditions of the people's communes, the masses continuously overcame the disasters of water, waterlogging, and drought, and within five months, they achieved miraculous achievements in restoring production and rebuilding their homes.

"Recovering the losses from the early rice harvest with the late rice harvest" was a fighting slogan put forward by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee after the flood, based on the strong wishes and determination of the people. The more than two million people in the four counties of Dongjiang launched a tenacious struggle to realize this slogan. From the day the flood receded to the latest day for transplanting late rice seedlings, there were only forty days apart. Within forty days, in order to ensure a bumper late rice harvest, the damaged water conservancy projects had to be repaired, at least to the extent that they could resist autumn tides and restore irrigation. The late rice planting area had to be larger than the same period last year, and it was also necessary to adhere to rational close planting and plant all the seedlings on time according to the season to seize high yields. So much work had to be completed within forty days. At that time, according to calculations, repairing the water conservancy projects alone would require all the labor force of the four counties to work for forty days. But with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, with the machinery, vehicles, and ships transferred from the province and brother counties, and especially with the people's communes, these difficulties were overcome one by one. In late July, the four counties completed the task of blocking breaches and restoring embankments, creating conditions for transplanting late rice seedlings. Then, on August 15, according to seasonal requirements, according to close planting requirements, and according to multiple planting plans, the task of transplanting rice seedlings was fully completed. At the same time, the four counties also planted miscellaneous grain crops, restored sideline production, and improved the living conditions of disaster victims.

After the late rice seedlings were transplanted, from August to early September, these four counties were hit by three heavy rains, and the Dongjiang River flood reached the warning level twice. The water level in the river was high, and the accumulated water in the rice fields inside the embankments could not be discharged, and the rice fields were continuously severely waterlogged. At this time, the communes mobilized hundreds of thousands of people to drain water and rescue most of the submerged late rice. For every mu that died, one mu was replanted. More than 200,000 mu of the bumper late rice in the four counties today were submerged three times and replanted three times. From mid-September, when the late rice was in the process of grouting and grain filling and needed a large amount of water, there was a drought without rain, which lasted for more than two months. However, because the water conservancy projects that had been repaired were filled with water during the heavy rains in July and August, the water was supplied continuously. Except for Boluo County, where water conservancy construction was relatively poor, and after the drought resistance struggle, 40,000 mu still died from drought and suffered crop failure, the rest of the late rice did not suffer yield reductions due to drought and achieved a bumper harvest.

The four counties of Dongjiang received strong assistance from the state in restoring and developing production and rebuilding their homes. In five months, the central government and the province allocated 30 million yuan in relief funds, reconstruction funds, and water conservancy funds to the four counties, more than 30 million catties of relief grain and seed grain, more than 20,000 cubic meters of wood, and more than 20,000 tons of coal.

Now, under the leadership of the Party, the people of these four counties are advancing victoriously, striving to fully restore their vitality and accelerate the development of production. (Attached picture)

    东江四个重灾县实现生产自救宏愿
    晚造夺回早造损失
    连续抗击一次洪水、三次内涝和两月干旱后，正在全面恢复元气三百多万亩晚稻单产和总产都比去年显著提高，经济作物恢复到去年同期水平，鸡鸭鹅较水灾前增长近一倍，生猪增加三万头，副业收入比去年同期增加一至二倍。
    据新华社广州6日电　广东省东江地区6月份遭受水灾最重的惠阳、博罗、增城、东莞四县，晚稻大丰收。这四个县的英雄人民，在水灾之后，连续战胜三次内涝和两个月的干旱威胁，实现了“晚造夺回早造损失”的豪迈口号；灾区重建家园的工作也获得了很大成就，有些村庄已经“不见灾痕见新村”。
    这四个县今年共计种植晚稻三百二十万亩，比去年同期多种了七十万亩，到11月中旬晚稻收割时，除九万亩因内涝，四万亩因干旱严重减产或失收外，其余的都获得了丰收。到11月底已经收割二百九十三万亩，单位面积产量都比大跃进的去年有显著提高。惠阳县最突出，平均亩产比去年晚稻增长五成多，东莞县增长三成多，博罗、增城两县差些，也分别比去年增长二成多和一成多。因为种植面积比去年扩大，四县晚稻总产量增长比例更高。
    这四个县的经济作物也恢复到了去年同期水平；鸡、鸭、鹅较水灾前增长近一倍；生猪较灾前增加三万头；其它副业收入比去年同期增加一倍到两倍。
    在重建家园方面，前几个月，是农忙季节，还不是大兴土木的时候，但也取得了极大的成绩。到11月底四个县共新建房屋三万三千多间，修建二万九千多间，共建六万三千间，约等于应建住宅十二万四千间的一半。6月大洪水冲塌了的是泥房，现在新建起的是砖房，大多数还装上玻璃窗。
    东江6月中旬发生了百年一遇的洪水。惠阳、博罗、增城、东莞四县地处东江中、下游，遭受了严重的水灾。当时，这四个县淹死失收的早稻一百三十万亩，毁坏的住房十二万间，一百多个自然村变成了废墟；其它如水利工程、畜牧业、经济作物、农具、财产都遭受了极其严重的损失。7月以后，在晚造生长期间，早期又遭受三次严重内涝，受淹晚稻三十九万亩，后期又发生了持续两月的干旱，受旱农田五十八万亩。但是在共产党的领导下，在人民公社的优越条件下，人民群众连续战胜水、涝、旱灾，不到五个月便在恢复生产和重建家园上获得了奇迹般的成就。
    “晚造夺回早造损失”，是水灾发生后中共广东省委根据人民群众的强烈愿望和决心，向党和人民群众提出的战斗口号。东江四县的二百多万人民，为了实现这个口号展开了顽强的战斗。从洪水退去之日，到晚稻插秧季节最迟的一天，相隔仅仅四十天。四十天内，为保证晚稻大丰收，就必须将被破坏的水利工程，起码修复到能抵抗秋澜和恢复灌溉的程度，晚稻就必须比去年同期多种，还必须坚持合理密植和按季节全部插下，以夺取高产。这么多工作都必须在四十天内完成。当时，据计算，只修复水利工程一项，动员四个县全部劳动力也得做四十天。但是有了人民解放军的大力支援，有了省和兄弟县调来的机器、车船，特别是有了人民公社，这些困难就被逐个克服了。在7月下旬四个县便全部完成了堵口复堤任务，为晚稻插秧创造了条件；接着在8月15日，按季节要求，按密植要求，按多种计划，全部完成了插秧任务。同时，四个县还种植了杂粮作物，恢复了副业生产，改善了灾民的居住条件。
    晚稻插秧后，从8月到9月初，这四个县又遭受了三次大雨袭击，东江洪水又两次达到警戒水位，河流水位高，堤围内稻田中的积水排泄不出，稻田连续遭到严重内涝。这时各公社又出动几十万人排水，抢救出了绝大部分被淹的晚稻。淹死的，死一亩，补插一亩。四个县现在有二十多万亩丰收的晚稻是淹死三次补插三次的。9月中旬起，晚稻正在灌浆结粒，需要大量水源的时候，却又干旱不雨，一直持续两个多月。但是，因为已经修复的水利工程，在7、8月大雨时蓄满了水，水能源源供应，除博罗县水利建设较差，经过抗旱斗争，仍有四万亩旱死失收外，其余的晚稻都没有因旱减产，获得了丰收。
    东江四县在恢复和发展生产以及重建家园中，得到了国家的大力援助。中央和省在五个月中，先后拨给四县救济款、重建家园款、水利款三千万元，救济粮、种籽粮三千多万斤，木材二万多立方米，煤两万多吨。
    现在，这四个县的人民，正在党的领导下乘胜前进，为全面地恢复元气，加速发展生产而努力。（附图片）
