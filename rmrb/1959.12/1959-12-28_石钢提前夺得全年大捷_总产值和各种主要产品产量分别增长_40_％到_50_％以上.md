Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company completed its total output value plan fifteen days ahead of schedule, and its annual production plans for major products such as pig iron, steel, steel products, coke, and cast iron pipes six days ahead of schedule. The total output value and the production of various major products increased by more than 40% to 50% compared with last year. The qualification rates of pig iron, steel, and steel products reached over 97% to 99% respectively. The overall labor productivity increased by more than 6% compared with last year. The costs of steel and iron decreased by 19% compared with last year, and the cost targets for other products were also fulfilled.

Firmly implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and continuously opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously carrying out mass movements centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, were the fundamental reasons for the company's continued leap forward in production this year. At the beginning of the year, in order to ensure the completion and commissioning of the new No. 3 blast furnace, No. 3 coke oven, and sintering plant, all employees of the company tried every means to overcome difficulties such as insufficient equipment and materials. After these new projects were put into production, the workers launched four battles in stages with the goal of increasing pig iron production, vigorously grasping the balanced connection of "before, after, left, and right" in production, and successively implemented five or six hundred technical and organizational measures, creating favorable conditions for increasing the production of steel and steel products. This year, the quality of iron ore at the company was not good enough. In order to ensure that the blast furnace was well-fed, the employees continuously adopted various measures such as strengthening raw material management, processing, and rational use, and during the rainy season, they rushed to build equipment for hydro-separating ore powder, which increased the iron content of the ore powder by 8% and also greatly increased the iron content of the ore, which played a significant role in increasing pig iron production.

After August, due to the thorough implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the masses grew greater and greater, and the company's production showed an excellent situation of increasing every ten days and every month. Compared with August, the average daily output in November increased by 47% for pig iron, 86% for steel, and 90% for steel products.

Now, while seizing the opportunity to overproduce more steel for the country, the company's employees are actively preparing for next year's production. The company's production plans for the first quarter and January of next year have all been issued and discussed by the masses.

　　石钢提前夺得全年大捷
    总产值和各种主要产品产量分别增长40％到50％以上
    新华社27日讯　石景山钢铁公司提前十五天完成总产值计划，提前六天完成生铁、钢、钢材、焦炭、铁铸管等主要产品的全年产量计划。总产值和各种主要产品的产量，分别比去年增长了40％到50％以上，生铁、钢和钢材的合格率分别达到97％到99％以上，全员劳动生产率比去年提高6％以上，钢和铁的成本比去年降低19％，其他产品成本指标也都完成了计划。
    坚决贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线，不断地反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，是这个公司今年生产继续跃进的根本原因。年初，为确保新建的三号高炉、三号焦炉和烧结厂建成投入生产，这个公司全体职工千方百计地克服了设备、材料不足的困难。在这批新工程投入生产之后，工人们又以增产生铁为中心分阶段地掀起了四个战役，大抓“前后左右”的平衡衔接生产，先后实现了大小五、六百项技术组织措施，为增产钢和钢材创造了有利条件。今年，这个公司的铁矿石质量不够好，为了使高炉吃饱、吃好，职工们连续采取加强原料管理、加工处理和合理使用等各种措施，并且在雨季里突击建成了水选矿粉的设备，使矿粉的含铁量提高8％，矿石的含铁量也大大提高，对提高生铁产量起了很大作用。
    8月以后，由于深入贯彻了党的八届八中全会决议，群众干劲越来越大，全公司生产出现了一旬高过一旬、一月高过一月的大好局面，11月份的平均日产量和8月份比较，生铁增长47％，钢增长86％，钢材增长90％。
    现在，这个公司的职工在抓紧时机为国家超产更多钢铁的同时，积极为明年生产作准备。全公司明年第一季度和1月份的生产计划，已经全部下达，并经过群众讨论。
