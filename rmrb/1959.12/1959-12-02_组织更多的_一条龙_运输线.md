Editorial:

    The "One-Dragon" transportation coordination conference, hosted by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Transport, and attended by the five industrial ministries of Metallurgy, Coal, Grain, Petroleum, and Forestry, has concluded. The "One-Dragon" transportation line method originated in Qinhuangdao and is now being promoted nationwide. It is an advanced method for closely linking production, transportation, and sales, comprehensively utilizing various means of transportation, tapping transportation potential, and developing the transportation industry in a faster, better, and more economical way. The transportation coordination conference hosted by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Transport promoted this advanced experience. Following the relatively stable and large-volume cargo flow, they wove a "Dragon Net" comprised of over three hundred "Big Dragons" and "Medium Dragons" between land and water, between production and supply and sales, primarily using railway trunk lines. They transformed the "One-Dragon" transportation lines into advanced lines for completing the national transportation plan. At the same time, numerous local transportation "Small Dragons" have also been organized. From the Songliao Plain in the north to Guangdong and Hainan in the south, from land to rivers, from the interior to the ocean, more and more giant transportation dragons are galloping ahead. This is a new and important development in transportation front's great cooperation.

    "Cooperation is strength," is a truth that everyone now understands, but for a long time in the past, not everyone paid attention to cooperation. When transportation coordination was first organized, the various transportation departments, as well as the transportation departments and the factories, mines and enterprises which were the material consigning departments, mostly relied on signing contracts and stipulating certain clauses to constrain each other. Later, joint offices were implemented, and the content and form of transportation coordination improved a step further, but at this time the scope of cooperation was still relatively narrow. The great rectification movement of 1957 was an important turning point in the development of transportation cooperation. The broad masses of workers raised their communist awareness, broke down departmentalism, and promoted a spirit of cooperation.

    "Leave the difficulties to ourselves and give the convenience to others" became the conscious action of the broad masses of workers. Based on this idea, since the Great Leap Forward last year, the experiences of road-mine cooperation in Fuxin, road-factory cooperation in Benxi, and road-port cooperation in Qinhuangdao have emerged one after another. Among them, Qinhuangdao, in particular, based on road-port cooperation, combined mines, railways, ports, ships, and receiving units to implement the "One-Dragon" transportation cooperation of fast unloading, fast loading, and fast transportation, developing transportation cooperation to a higher stage of comprehensive and large-scale cooperation. After the emergence of the "One-Dragon" transportation line in Qinhuangdao, it attracted the attention of transportation departments and material consigning departments across the country. This experience was quickly promoted in various places and has been further developed. Now, many forms of "One-Dragon" transportation lines have appeared across the country. There are "One-Dragons" for bulk key materials such as steel and coal; there are "One-Dragons" for small and scattered goods such as local specialties; there are "One-Dragons" for water-land combined transportation pioneered by Qinhuangdao and now being promoted at various water and land terminals; there are "One-Dragons" for railway trunk lines spanning several railway bureaus and stretching thousands of kilometers; there are "One-Dragons" for waterways connecting rivers, seas, and rivers being organized in Shanghai Port; there are "One-Dragons" that integrate production, transportation, and sales implemented in Changli County, Hebei; there are "One-Dragons" for short-distance transportation implemented in Licheng County, Shanxi, which combine modern transportation tools and folk transportation tools, and assign fixed points and areas for each to give full play to their strengths. Such a situation of "flying dragons" has greatly changed the face of the transportation industry and greatly improved transportation efficiency.

    The "One-Dragon" transportation line reflects the internal connection between production, transportation, and sales. Any product must go through the transportation process from production to sales, and many products must go through several means of transportation in succession. In this process, due to the many links, disconnections often easily occur. For example, if coal from the north is transported to the south by rail and ship, if it is not well organized, it may initially be a case of coal waiting for cars, and cars waiting for coal, then cars waiting for ships, and ships waiting for cars, and finally ships arriving but the port is congested and the goods cannot be unloaded. This disconnection not only delays the circulation process of materials, but also prevents the country's limited means of transportation from fully exerting their effectiveness. Organizing "One-Dragon" transportation lines fundamentally avoids this disconnection. It not only organizes multiple means of transportation into a unified operation process, forming a transportation line that is connected in a line and interlocked; but also connects factories, mines, and other production units in the front, and receiving departments in the rear, twisting the strengths of all parties into one rope, making the process from production to sales smooth and rapid. Wherever "One-Dragon" transportation lines are organized, transportation is immediately accelerated. The turnover of means of transportation is fast, the circulation of materials is fast, and it can even achieve "coal not landing," being loaded onto the car as soon as it is mined from the ground, and the car going directly to the port to be loaded onto the ship, and the ship sailing all the way to the destination. Many stations and ports that used to shout "congestion" and were afraid of too many cars and ships coming are now calm and unhurried, and are not afraid of more cars and ships coming. Dalian Port, a Northeast sea-land transportation hub, created its highest throughput in the 60 years since the port was built after organizing the "One-Dragon" transportation line in October, and the long-standing problem of timber congestion was fundamentally solved. What a huge change this is! Because it is transported quickly, it is also transported more, and the same transportation equipment can exert higher transportation efficiency. This fully meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

    The continuous leap forward in production has brought an increasing number of tasks to transportation. Transportation has become a relatively weak link in the national economy. Solving this contradiction and increasing transportation equipment is an important way; but in the immediate term, what is more important is to tap transportation potential. Taking railway transportation as an example, in the past year or so, the average number of wagons loaded daily on railways across the country has increased by 13,000, of which only one-quarter was increased by new freight cars, and the remaining three-quarters were increased by tapping transportation potential. And the greatest transportation potential lies precisely in cooperation, especially in comprehensive cooperation. The starting station, the consigning unit, and the transportation department cooperate very well, and the vehicle dwell time is compressed by one hour, which is certainly a great achievement; however, if the receiving unit and the transportation department do not cooperate well at the terminal station, and the vehicle dwell time is extended by one hour, the transportation potential that has already been tapped will be wasted. Only comprehensive and large-scale cooperation can fully tap the transportation potential. Organizing "One-Dragon" transportation lines is organizing comprehensive and large-scale cooperation. It is not the cooperation of certain links in the transportation process, but the comprehensive cooperation of all links from beginning to end throughout the entire transportation process, so it can fully exert the potential of vehicles and ships, enabling the transportation industry to use existing equipment to bear greater transportation tasks.

    Organizing "One-Dragon" transportation lines is organizing a mass movement of great cooperation. Without the selfless communist cooperation spirit and conscious action of the thousands of workers in the various links of consignment, carriage, transit, and receipt in the transportation process, the "Dragon" is difficult to move. The primary condition for organizing "One-Dragon" transportation lines is to carry out thorough and meticulous ideological work, and mobilize the broad masses of workers ideologically with the communist spirit of cooperation. Only with a unified understanding can there be unified action.

    To do a good job in "One-Dragon" transportation lines, it is also necessary to vigorously carry out a mass movement of technical innovation. The purpose of organizing "One-Dragon" transportation lines is to transport goods to their destinations at the fastest speed through the great cooperation of all links in the entire transportation process. How can we achieve this fastest speed? Physical strength alone is limited. "If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools." Only when all links in the entire transportation process vigorously carry out a mass movement of technical innovation, reform transportation tools, and promote new technologies can we strive for the fastest speed. The current focus of technical innovation should be on strengthening the loading and unloading equipment of enterprises. Loading and unloading is the weakest link in the transportation process. Congestion, empty cars not being able to be sent out, and heavy cars not being able to enter the station often occur because loading and unloading cannot keep up. In strengthening loading and unloading equipment, it is still necessary to implement the principle of combining foreign and local methods. On the one hand, it is necessary to increase the necessary loading and unloading machinery, especially in large stations, large ports, and places with heavy equipment entering and exiting; on the other hand, it is necessary to vigorously promote effective measures that combine foreign and local methods, such as high platforms, low cargo positions, and coal storage bins. Only in this way can the problem be solved quickly.

    Organizing "One-Dragon" transportation lines is a new topic in transportation organization work. "One-Dragon" transportation lines connect production, transportation, and sales, and run through the entire transportation process. It is a very large, complex, and meticulous organizational work. Without this strong organizational work, there would be no "One-Dragon". In particular, organizing a "Dragon Net" across the country is a completely new task. This requires party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership, and to mobilize the leaders, planning and scheduling personnel, and the broad masses of workers in the transportation departments to devote more diligent labor to do this work well.

    Only the last thirty days remain in 1959. Currently, it is a very busy and tense time on the transportation front. We must do everything possible to tap transportation potential and transport all kinds of urgently needed materials to their destinations, and the "One-Dragon" transportation line is an effective measure to tap transportation potential. All relevant departments should work together to promote this advanced method, so that transportation work can make greater contributions to completing this year's national economic plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it, and to the continued leap forward next year!

### 组织更多的“一条龙”运输线

    组织更多的“一条龙”运输线
    由铁道部、交通部主持，有冶金、煤炭、粮食、石油、林业等五个工业部参加的“一条龙”运输大协作会议闭幕了。“一条龙”运输线的方法，发源于秦皇岛，现已在全国推行。它是密切产、运、销的联系，综合利用各种运输工具，挖掘运输潜力，多快好省地发展运输事业的先进方法。铁道部、交通部主持的运输大协作会议推行了这个先进的经验。他们按照比较稳定的、数量比较大的货物流向，在水陆之间，生产与供销之间，以铁路干线为主，编织了一个包括三百多条
  “大龙”和“中龙”的“龙网”。把“一条龙”运输线变为完成国家运输计划的先进线。与此同时，许许多多地方运输的“小龙”也组织起来。北起松辽平原，南至两广海南，从陆地到河川，从内地到海洋，正有越来越多的运输巨龙长驱奔驰。这是运输战线上大协作的一个新的重要的发展。
    “协作就是力量”，这是现在大家都体会到的真理，但是在过去很长一段时间里，并不是人人都注意协作的。在开始组织运输协作的时候，各个不同的运输部门之间，以及运输部门和厂矿企业等物资托运部门之间，多半还是靠签订合同，规定一些条款来彼此约束。后来实行了联合办公，运输协作的内容和形式就提高了一步，但是这个时候协作的范围还比较窄。1957年伟大的整风运动是发展运输协作的一个重要转折点。广大职工提高了共产主义觉悟，大破本位主义，大兴协作之风。
    “把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”，成了广大职工的自觉行动。在这个思想基础上，去年大跃进以来，先后出现了阜新路矿协作的经验，本溪路厂协作的经验和秦皇岛路港协作的经验。其中特别是秦皇岛，又在路港协作的基础上，把矿山、铁路、港口、船舶和收货单位结合在一起，实行快卸、快装、快运的“一条龙”运输大协作，把运输协作发展到一个更高的全面大协作的阶段。秦皇岛的“一条龙”运输线出现以后，吸引了全国各个运输部门和物资托运部门的注意，这个经验迅速在各地推广开来，并且得到新的发展。现在，全国已经出现了许多种形式的“一条龙”运输线。有钢铁、煤炭等大宗重点物资的“一条龙”；有土特产等零散货物的“一条龙”；有秦皇岛所首创的，现在正在各个水陆码头推行的水陆联运“一条龙”；有跨越几个铁路局，长达几千公里的铁路干线的“一条龙”；有正在上海港组织的沟通江海河的水上“一条龙”；有河北昌黎县实行的把产、运、销结合起来的“一条龙”；有山西黎城县实行的把现代运输工具和民间运输工具结合起来，定点划片，各展所长的短途运输的“一条龙”。这样一个“群龙飞舞”的局面，大大地改变了运输事业的面貌，大大提高了运输效率。
    “一条龙”运输线反映了产、运、销之间的内在联系。任何产品由生产到销售都要经过运输过程，许多产品还要经过几种运输工具连续运输。在这个过程中，由于环节很多，常常容易发生脱节现象。例如，北方的煤炭经由铁路和轮船运到南方，如果组织得不好，始而可能煤等车、车等煤，继而又可能车等船、船等车，最后还可能船到了，港口堵塞，卸不下货来。这种脱节现象不仅延缓了物资的流转过程，而且使国家有限的运输工具不能充分发挥效能。组织“一条龙”运输线从根本上避免了这种脱节现象。它不仅把多种运输工具组织成一个统一的作业过程，形成一条一线相连、环环紧扣的运输线；而且前接厂矿企业等生产单位，后连收货部门，把各个方面的力量拧成一股绳，使产品从生产到销售的过程畅通无阻、快速流转。凡是组织“一条龙”运输线的地方，运输立即加快了。运输工具周转得快，物资流转得快，甚至可以做到“煤炭不落地”，从地下采出来就装上车，车到港口直接装上船，船一直开到目的地。许多过去喊“堵塞”，唯恐车来多了，船来多了的车站和港口，现在从容不迫，不怕来更多的车，更多的船。东北海陆运输枢纽大连港10月份组织“一条龙”运输线后，吞吐量就创造了建港六十年来的最高纪录，过去长期苦恼的木材堵塞问题得到根本解决。这是多么巨大的变化啊！因为运得快，也就运得多，同样的运输设备能发挥更高的运输效率。这是完全符合多快好省要求的。
    生产的不断跃进，给运输带来日益增多的任务。运输成了目前国民经济中一个比较薄弱的环节。解决这个矛盾，增加运输设备是一个重要途径；但就眼前来说，更重要的，还是靠挖掘运输潜力。拿铁路运输来说，最近一年多来全国铁路每天平均装车数增加了一万三千车，其中靠新的货车增加的不过四分之一，其余四分之三都是靠挖掘运输潜力增加的。而最大的运输潜力，恰恰就出在协作上面，特别是在全面协作上面。起点站，发货单位和运输部门协作得很好，车辆停留时间压缩了一小时，这固然是很大的成绩；但是，如果到了终点站，收货单位和运输部门协作得不好，车辆停留时间延长了一小时，就把已经挖出的运输潜力又浪费掉了。只有全面大协作，才能把运输潜力充分挖掘出来。组织“一条龙”运输线，就是组织全面大协作。它不是运输过程中某几个环节的协作，而是整个运输过程自始至终各个环节的全面协作，因而能够充分地发挥车辆船舶的潜力，使运输业能够利用现有的设备负担更大的运输任务。
    组织“一条龙”运输线，就是组织大协作的群众运动。没有运输过程中托运、承运、接运、收货等各个环节千万职工克己宽人的共产主义协作精神和自觉行动，“龙”是难以行动的。组织“一条龙”运输线的首要条件，就是深入细致地进行思想工作，用共产主义协作精神把广大职工群众从思想上动员起来。认识一致，行动才能一致。
    搞好“一条龙”运输线，还要大力开展技术革新的群众运动。组织“一条龙”运输线的目的，是要通过整个运输过程各个环节的大协作，用最快的速度把货物运送到目的地。怎么才能取得这个最快的速度呢？光凭体力是有限的。“工欲善其事，必先利其器”，只有整个运输过程的各个环节都大搞技术革新的群众运动，改革运输工具，推广新技术，才能争取到最快的速度。当前技术革新的重点应该放在加强企业的装卸设备上。装卸，这是目前运输过程中最薄弱的环节。堵塞、空车发不出去、重车不能进站，常常是由于装卸跟不上去才发生的。在加强装卸设备方面，仍然要贯彻洋土并举的方针。一方面要增加必要的装卸机械，特别是大站、大港和有重型设备进出的地方；另一方面要大力推行高站台、低货位、储煤仓等洋土结合的有效措施。这样才能迅速地解决问题。
    组织“一条龙”运输线，是运输组织工作中一个新的课题。“一条龙”运输线沟通产、运、销，贯穿整个运输过程，是一个很庞大、很复杂、很细致的组织工作。没有这种强有力的组织工作，就没有“一条龙”。特别是要在全国组织一个“龙网”，更是一件全新的工作。这就需要各地党委加强领导，并且发动运输部门的领导人员、计划调度人员和广大职工付出更辛勤的劳动，把这个工作做好。
    1959年，只剩下最后三十天了，目前正是运输战线上十分繁忙紧张的时刻，必须千方百计挖掘运输潜力，把各种急需物资运到目的地去，而“一条龙”运输线，正是挖运输潜力一项有效措施。各有关部门应当同心协力来推广这个先进的方法，使运输工作为提前和超额完成今年国民经济计划、为明年的继续跃进作出更大的贡献！
