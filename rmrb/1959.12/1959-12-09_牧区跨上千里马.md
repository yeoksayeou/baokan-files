    Pastoral Areas Gallop on a Thousand-Li Horse
    The animal husbandry production in pastoral areas such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Gansu has achieved high-speed development after the people's communes were established. This is another proof of the boundless vitality of the people's communes. From the news published in today's newspaper, we can see the prosperous scene of millions of horses, cattle, sheep, and camels being strong and fat on the vast grasslands; we can see that our pastoral areas, like the vast cities and rural areas, are also joyfully galloping and developing at high speed. The high-speed development of animal husbandry in these famous pastoral areas will have a huge impact on the development of animal husbandry in our country as a whole, on the construction of our vast pastoral areas, and on the improvement of the lives of our fraternal ethnic groups.
    Animal husbandry is an important component of our national economy, and it is closely related to both agricultural and industrial production. The high-speed development of animal husbandry in famous pastoral areas such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Qinghai will inevitably support agricultural and animal husbandry production across the country with more draught animals and improved breeds (such as Xinjiang fine-wool sheep and Yanqi horses, which are already famous throughout the country), supply the people of the country with more meat, milk powder, butter, etc., and support industrial production with more hides and wool.
    Why has animal husbandry production in pastoral areas developed so rapidly in the past year? The fundamental and decisive reason is the establishment of people's communes. The people's communes in Xinjiang pastoral areas classify animals according to their type, physique, age, and other conditions, and graze them in groups, dividing the grassland accordingly. In Qinghai, on the basis of communization, the herdsmen have appropriately reduced the size of the herds and fixed the grazing personnel. The herdsmen of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture gave full play to the favorable conditions of the people's communes and implemented rotational grazing by herd, season, and area, and promoted advanced experiences such as daytime grazing and nighttime supplementary feeding. More importantly, the people's communes can better implement the policy of focusing on animal husbandry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations, and can more smoothly implement settled grazing. This will not only ensure the stable and high-speed development of animal husbandry production, but also comprehensively promote the development of the pastoral economy and the improvement of people's lives.
    The instability of animal husbandry production is primarily due to the fact that most herdsmen used to live a nomadic life, relying mostly on natural pastures for grazing. There was no fixed guarantee for livestock feed, and once natural disasters occurred, large numbers of livestock were easily killed. Therefore, to ensure stable and increased animal husbandry production, the implementation of settled grazing is an important measure. In addition, most of the grain in pastoral areas relies on supplies from other places, which is not only uneconomical but also affects the improvement of herdsmen's living standards, and sometimes leads to the slaughter of large numbers of livestock due to insufficient grain, which directly affects the development of animal husbandry. Now, after the establishment of people's communes, it is possible to free up labor to develop agricultural production and establish grain and feed bases, changing the historical situation in which pastoral areas have long lacked food for people and feed for livestock. In this way, the overall construction speed on the grasslands will definitely be greatly accelerated.

    牧区跨上千里马
    内蒙古、新疆、宁夏、青海、甘肃等牧区的畜牧业生产，在人民公社化后获得了高速度发展。这是人民公社生命力无限强大的又一证明。从今天本报刊登的消息中，可以看到在辽阔的草原上，数以百万计的马、牛、羊、骆驼膘肥体壮的丰盛景象；可以看到在我们的牧区也像广大的城市和农村一样，在纵情飞奔、高速度发展的欢腾景象。这些著名牧区畜牧业的高速度发展，对于我国整个畜牧业的发展，对于我国广大牧区的建设和兄弟民族生活的提高，都将发生十分巨大的作用。
    畜牧业是我国国民经济的重要组成部分，无论对于农业生产和工业生产，关系都十分密切。内蒙古、新疆、青海等著名牧区畜牧业的高速度发展，必然能以更多的役畜和良种畜（例如新疆细毛羊、焉耆马等已经誉满全国）支援全国的农牧业生产，能够以更多的肉食、乳粉、奶油等供应全国人民，以更多的畜皮和毛绒来支援工业生产。
    牧区的畜牧业生产，这一年来为什么能发展得这么快呢？根本的有决定性的原因是建立了人民公社。新疆牧区各人民公社根据牲畜的种类、体质、年龄等不同情况，分类编群，划分草原，因草牧放。青海各地牧民在公社化的基础上，适当划小畜群，固定放牧人员。甘南藏族自治州牧民发挥人民公社的有利条件，实行分群分季分区轮牧，推广了昼夜放牧、夜间补饲等先进经验。更加重要的是，人民公社可以更好地执行以牧为主，农牧结合、发展多种经营的方针，可以更顺利地实行定居放牧。这就不仅能够保证畜牧生产稳定地高速度地发展，而且还全面地促进了牧区经济的发展和人民生活的改善。
    畜牧业生产的不稳定性，首先是由于大部分牧民过去游牧为生，多依赖天然的牧场来放牧，牲畜的饲料没有固定的保障，一旦遇到自然灾害，容易遭致畜群的大批死亡。因此要保证畜牧业稳定增产，实行定居放牧是一项重要措施。另外，牧区的粮食绝大部分依赖外地供应，既不经济，也影响牧民生活水平的提高，有时还因粮食不足而宰杀大批牲畜，这就直接影响了畜牧业的发展。现在，建立人民公社以后，就有可能抽出劳力发展农业生产，建立粮食和饲料基地，改变历史上牧区长期人缺口粮、牲畜缺饲料的状况。这样，草原上整个建设速度定然大大加快。
