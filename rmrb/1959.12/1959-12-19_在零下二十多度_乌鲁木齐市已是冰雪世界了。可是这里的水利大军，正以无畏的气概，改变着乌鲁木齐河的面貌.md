    In Temperatures of Minus Twenty Degrees

    Urumqi is already a world of ice and snow. But the water conservancy army here, with dauntless spirit, is changing the face of the Urumqi River…
    Our Correspondent Yang Kexian
    After several snowfalls, Urumqi is a world of ice and snow, draped in white. From the majestic foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, stretching deep into the boundless Junggar Basin, all is a vast expanse of white. Yet, a surge of "heat" is rolling down the Urumqi River. This is a human-made river more than forty kilometers long, interspersed with the sounds of earth ramming, rock striking, singing, and laughter. Tens of thousands of water conservancy workers, braving the severe cold of more than minus twenty degrees, are changing the face of the Urumqi River with dauntless spirit.

    Scale Grows Year by Year

    Like all rivers fed by melting snow and ice, the Urumqi River has an extraordinarily violent character. In summer, large amounts of snow melt in the Tianshan Mountains, causing flood peaks to increase dozens to over a hundred times, bringing endless disasters to the people of all ethnic groups along the banks. But when it comes to the season for agricultural water use, the flow of more than twenty cubic meters per second is largely swallowed up and seeped away by the boundless gravel of the Gobi Desert once it exits the Tianshan canyon. Farmland below the mountains suffers from drought year after year. Urumqi city is only thirty-odd kilometers from the Tianshan canyon, and even tree planting is difficult due to lack of water.

    This was the situation in the past, but it is very different now.

    I walked downstream along the Urumqi River, treading on the loose stones. In winter, the riverbed is already dry. The center of this riverbed, where "horses walk among loose stones, and all four hooves bleed," has now been turned into a flat avenue by the army building canals and the flowing stream of vehicles. Horses, steaming with heat, pull rubber-tired carts, constantly transporting cement, sand, and water conservancy construction materials to the canal construction site from morning till night. Further downstream, along the snow-covered roads beside the river, hundreds and thousands of people use sleds to pull huge flagstones to designated locations.

    Every winter, the people of all ethnic groups in the Urumqi area brave wind, snow, and severe cold to engage in water conservancy construction. Diligent labor is exchanged for large tracts of fertile land. In ten years, the land irrigated by the Urumqi River has increased from 60,000 mu to 420,000 mu, an average increase of more than 36,000 mu per year. This winter's water conservancy plan is even larger, aiming to control all the water flow of the Urumqi River artificially in one go, using it for power generation and irrigation. The Ulabo Reservoir, with a storage capacity of 70 million cubic meters (the first phase being 40 million cubic meters), and the reconstruction of the 35-kilometer-long Heping Canal, which are currently under construction, are two important projects for fundamentally controlling the Urumqi River. Once these two projects are completed, they will increase the irrigated area by 140,000 mu next year and also improve the irrigation conditions for the existing 420,000 mu of land.

            Competing with Each Other to Improve Work Efficiency

    The Urumqi Municipal机关 [Jiguan - lit. "organ" or "institution" - usually meaning "government office" or "administrative department"] Obligatory Labor Army and the Autonomous Region Industrial Transportation 机关 Obligatory Labor Army are two adjacent units. To get ahead of schedule, in late November, they simultaneously received new tasks: to pour concrete at high speed on a section of the canal bottom. This was originally work that only skilled workers could do. According to the quota, each section of canal bottom (26 square meters) should take ninety minutes to pour. However, neither of these obligatory labor armies knew how to pour concrete. Initially, one took a hundred minutes, and the other took a hundred and thirty minutes.

    "Ask if you don't understand, learn if you don't know." In the severe cold of minus twenty degrees, pouring concrete requires warming the sand and water, and adding salt to lower the freezing point. Although these techniques were quickly learned, the pouring time could not be shortened. The crux of the problem was poor labor organization and long transport distances, so they moved all the concrete-making tools to the edge of the canal and dug for stones and sieved sand right there. In less than two days, when the municipal 机关 shortened the time to pour one section of canal bottom to sixty minutes, the Autonomous Region Industrial Transportation unit had already shortened it to fifty-one minutes, and people beat gongs and drums to report the good news to the construction site command.

    The Urumqi Municipal 机关 quickly caught up, surpassing their opponent with forty-one minutes. That afternoon, the other side took the lead again with thirty-two minutes. The Urumqi Municipal 机关 immediately convened a "Zhuge Liang meeting" [a meeting to pool wisdom, named after a famous strategist], looking for tricks and reforming techniques. They changed from two people carrying sand to using a cart, so that they only needed to push one cart instead of carrying seven times; they changed from dry mixing first and then wet mixing, to continuous dry and wet mixing, eliminating the pauses. They also established mass inspection teams and finally created a new record, pouring a section of canal bottom in twenty-seven minutes, with completely qualified quality.

          Overcoming the Cold, Accelerating Project Progress

    "Don't let the project cross the New Year" has become a resounding slogan. The Heping Canal was originally scheduled to complete reconstruction in March next year. Due to everyone's hard work and ingenuity, the project is progressing rapidly. From November 16th to December 10th, approximately 75% of the more than 240,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work has already been completed.

    The frozen soil layer is getting thicker day by day. In the downstream section of the Heping Canal, the Hongqi People's Commune work team in Mi'quan County, the frozen layer has thickened to seventy centimeters. A pickaxe hitting the frozen soil feels like hitting concrete.

    "What to do?" Chen Peng, the commune Party secretary, came to the construction site of the Gaojiahu Production Team and consulted with several experienced farmers. "We're not afraid of any difficulty, we'll just拼上干 [pīn shàng gàn - give it our all]!" "I think we should use explosives!" But if we just拼上干, how long will it take? Every day of delay will increase the difficulties; where will we get explosives? Chen Peng finally thought of the method farmers use to heat their kangs [traditional brick beds], suggesting to use straw and chaff to burn and smoke the frozen soil. Everyone agreed to this method. Every day after work, commune members cleared the snow from the next day's work section, spread straw and chaff, and slowly smoked the soil. The sand and soil loosened, and each person could dig more than ten cubic meters of earth and stone per day. Within five days, they had dug more than 12,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, and it is expected that the dry stone masonry project, which is scheduled to begin next year, can be carried out ahead of schedule.

    在零下二十多度
    乌鲁木齐市已是冰雪世界了。可是这里的水利大军，正以无畏的气概，改变着乌鲁木齐河的面貌……
    本报记者　杨克现
    几度风雪，乌鲁木齐市已是粉装素裹的冰雪世界了。从巍峨的天山脚下，一直伸向无边的准噶尔盆地的深处，全是白茫茫的一片。然而，一股“热浪”正沿乌鲁木齐河滚滚而下。这是一条长达四十多公里的人的河流，其间夹杂着打夯声、击石声、歌声和笑声。成千上万的水利劳动大军冒着零下二十多度的严寒，以无畏的气概，改变着乌鲁木齐河的面貌。
    规模一年比一年大
    像所有承受融化冰雪的河流一样，乌鲁木齐河的性格暴躁异常。夏季，天山大量化雪，洪峰突增几十倍到一百多倍，洪水带给沿岸各族人民无穷的灾难。可是到了农时用水的季节，那每秒二十多公方的流水，一出天山峡谷便被无边的戈壁砾石大量吞没了，渗漏了。山下农田年年受旱，乌鲁木齐市离天山峡谷只有三十多公里，连植树用水也非常困难。
    这是过去的情况，现在已大大不同了。
    我踏着堆满碌石的乌鲁木齐河向下游走去，冬季河床已经干涸了。这条“马走碌石中、四蹄皆血流”的河床正中，如今已被修渠的大军、流水一般的车辆踏成了平坦的大道。浑身冒着热气的骏马，拉着胶轮车，从早到晚，不断地把水泥、砂石和水利建筑材料运向渠道工地。再向下游走去，河旁铺满冰雪的公路上，成百上千的人用雪撬把斗大的片石拉到了预定地点。
    每年冬天，乌鲁木齐地区各族人民都要冒着风雪严寒兴修水利。辛勤的劳动换来大片良田沃土。十年间，乌鲁木齐河灌溉的土地已从六万亩增加到四十二万亩，平均每年增加三万六千多亩。今年冬修水利规划更大，一次就要把乌鲁木齐河流水全部用人工控制起来，叫它发电，叫它灌溉。而正在施工的库容七千万立方的乌拉泊水库（第一期工程为四千万立方）和改建长达三十五公里的和平渠道，便是根治乌鲁木齐河两项重要的工程。这两项工程完工后，明年就可以增加灌溉面积十四万亩，也改善原有四十二万多亩土地灌溉的条件。
            你追我赶，提高工效
    乌鲁木齐市机关义务劳动大军和自治区工业交通机关义务劳动大军是两个相毗邻的单位。为了抢在时间的前面，11月下旬，他们同时接到了新的任务，要高速度地在一部分渠底浇混凝土，这本来是技术工人才能做的工作。按照定额，每浇灌一块渠底（二十六平方米），时间是九十分钟。可是，这两支义务劳动大军都不懂得如何浇灌混凝土工程，最初，他们一个用了一百分钟，另外一个用了一百三十分钟。
    “不懂就问，不会就学”。在零下二十多度的严寒里，浇灌混凝土必须要温砂、热水，同时还要加食盐降低冰点才行。这些技术虽然很快学会了，可是浇灌时间还不能缩短。问题的症结是劳动组织不好，是运距较远，于是他们都把制混凝土的工具全部搬到渠边，就在渠边挖石筛砂。不两天，当市级机关把浇灌一块渠底的工时缩短到六十分钟时，而自治区工业交通单位已缩短到五十一分钟，人们敲锣打鼓向工地指挥部报了喜。
    乌鲁木齐市机关急起直追，刚以四十一分钟超过了对手，当天下午对方又以三十二分钟占先。乌鲁木齐市级机关立即召开了诸葛亮会，找窍门，改革技术。他们把两人抬砂子改为车子推，原来抬七次，现在只要推一车；他们把先干拌后湿拌两次拌搅，改为干拌湿拌流水作业，取消了间歇期，同时还成立了群众检查组，最后终于创造了新纪录，以二十七分钟浇灌了一块渠底，质量完全合格。
          战胜寒冷，加快工程进度
    “不让工程过年”已成为响亮的口号。和平渠原定在明年3月完成改建工程。由于大家的苦干巧干，工程进展很快，从11月16日到12月10日，二十四万多个土石方已完成了75％左右。
    冻土层一天天在加厚。和平渠下游米泉县红旗人民公社工段，冻层加厚到七十厘米了，十字镐打在冰冻的土上，就像碰到了混凝土上。
    “怎么办？”公社党委书记陈鹏来到高家户生产队的工地上，找几个有经验的农民商量。“天大的困难也不怕，我们拼上干啦！”“我看用炸药炸罢！”可是拼上干，干到什么时候去？每迟延一天都会增加更大的困难；用炸药炸，炸药在哪里？陈鹏最后想起了农民烧热炕的办法，提议用稻草稻壳火烧烟熏冻土。大家都同意用这个办法，每天下工，公社社员就扫清了第二天工段的积雪，铺上稻草稻壳，慢火烟熏，砂土疏松了，每人每天能挖十多个土石方。五天之内，便挖完了一万二千多个土石方，预计在明年开始的干砌片石工程能提前进行了。
