　　Listening to the Party, I am Filled with Strength
　　Li Zhenfen, Captain of the "Iron Girls" Production Team, Juren People's Commune, Bin County, Heilongjiang Province
    In 1959, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, our commune achieved another great leap forward on the foundation of the Great Leap Forward of last year, and reaped an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fisheries. Under the leadership and encouragement of the Party, our "Iron Girls" production team vigorously engaged in high-yield experimental fields, and also achieved considerable success. This year, our team of eleven sisters cultivated twenty-five mu of experimental fields, of which fifteen mu of corn yielded 1,010 jin per mu, an increase of 700 jin compared to ordinary fields; five mu of rice and five mu of soybeans, after experiencing more than forty days of drought in the summer, were also hit by severe floods, yet still achieved a bumper harvest. Rice yielded 620 jin per mu, an increase of 120 jin compared to ordinary fields; soybeans yielded 600 jin per mu, an increase of 320 jin compared to ordinary fields. Through this year's Great Leap Forward, we learned a lot of agricultural techniques and explored some experiences in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in Heilongjiang Province, a place with a short frost-free period. These experiences are of considerable value for a greater leap forward next year. In this year, I personally learned various agricultural techniques such as plowing, sowing, harrowing, driving carts, artificial pollination of corn, milking cows, injecting livestock and poultry, artificial insemination of livestock, weather observation, driving tractors, and operating new agricultural tools. I also reformed and manufactured manure spreaders, weeders, corn pollination machines, and well drilling tools.
    In this year, the most unforgettable thing for me, and also the most glorious thing in my life, was my participation in the vanguard of the working class—the great Chinese Communist Party. When I joined the Party, the branch secretary said to me: "Little Li, to be a communist, you must be honest and listen to the Party. You must constantly fight against difficulties and always move forward!" I always remember these words. Whenever I encounter difficulties, these words shine brightly before my eyes, and I am filled with strength. I often think: as a communist, how can I dedicate everything to the Party and the people? How can I do more work for the great ideal—communism? I always feel that I am not doing enough, and I always want to learn more skills and do more work. Wherever the Party points, I will rush there. I learn from old farmers, from books, from advanced units, from tractor drivers and technicians. Whatever difficulties I encounter in production, I study them. I learn and experiment at the same time, and I don't stop until the problem is solved. Every time I solve a problem, I feel that communism is closer to me, and therefore I am even more motivated.
    1960 is coming soon. Recently, our commune has formulated a new plan. In 1960, our commune's production will have greater development, and the face of the countryside will have greater changes. Now all the commune members are working with soaring enthusiasm, vigorously engaging in winter production, and creating conditions in all aspects—materially, financially, and technically—for the Great Leap Forward next year. All the sisters in our team are full of confidence and are determined to create greater achievements in the new year and dedicate them to the cause of socialist construction. The commune Party committee decided that our production team will be increased from the current eleven people to twenty people, and the experimental fields will be increased from twenty-five mu to one hundred mu, striving to achieve an average yield of one thousand jin per mu. Each person will raise one pig, the whole team will raise one hundred chickens, raise forty thousand fish, and vigorously engage in sideline production such as weaving and firewood gathering. In this year's winter production, we will repair 500 meters of canals, repair two machine wells, expand three small reservoirs, accumulate and create seven million jin of fertilizer, and complete water conservancy and fertilizer application before the Spring Festival. I personally must listen to the Party, always be a good daughter of the Party, and always be a vanguard of the Great Leap Forward.

### 听党的话，浑身都是力量

　　听党的话，浑身都是力量
　　黑龙江省宾县居仁人民公社“铁姑娘”生产队队长　李贞芬
    1959年，我们公社在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在去年大跃进的基础上，又实现了大跃进，获得了农林牧副渔全面大丰收。我们“铁姑娘”生产队，在党的领导和鼓励下，大搞高产试验田，也取得了不小的成绩。今年我们全队十一名姐妹，种了二十五亩试验田，其中十五亩玉米亩产一千零十斤，比一般田增产七百斤；五亩水稻和五亩大豆，在夏季四十多天干旱之后，又遭遇了大洪水的侵袭，仍然获得大丰收，水稻亩产六百二十斤，比一般田增产一百二十斤；大豆亩产六百斤，比一般田增产三百二十斤。通过今年的大跃进，我们学到了不少农业技术，摸索到一些在黑龙江省这个无霜期短的地方，贯彻农业“八字宪法”的经验，这些经验，对明年的更大跃进有不小价值。我个人在这一年当中，学会了扶犁、点种、趟地、赶车、玉米人工授粉、黄牛挤奶、畜禽注射、牲畜人工授精、气象观测、驾驶拖拉机、操作新式农具等多种农业技术，还改革制造了摅粪机、除草机、玉米授粉机和打机井工具等。
    在这一年里，使我最难忘的，也是我一生中最光荣的，是我参加了工人阶级的先锋队——伟大的中国共产党。在入党时，支部书记对我说：“小李啊，作一个共产党员，要老老实实，听党的话，要不断向困难作斗争，永远前进！”我时刻都记着这句话，当我一遇到困难的时候，这句话就在眼前闪着金光，浑身都是力量。我经常在想：作为一个共产党员，怎样才算把自己的一切都献给了党和人民？怎样才能为伟大的理想——共产主义多做些工作呢？我总觉着自己干的太少了，总想多学些本领，多干些活。党指向那里，我就奔向那里。我向老农学习，向书本学习，向先进单位学习，向拖拉机手和技术人员学习，生产上遇到什么困难，我就钻研什么，一边学一边试验，不解决问题不算完。每当我解决了一个问题之后，都觉得共产主义和自己更靠近了，因此干劲也就更足了。
    1960年就要到了。最近我们公社制订了新的规划，在1960年，我们公社的生产将要有更大的发展，农村的面貌将要有更大改变。现在全体社员正以冲天的干劲，大搞冬季生产，在物质上、资金上、技术上，在各个方面为明年的大跃进创造条件。我们全队的姐妹们都信心百倍，一定要在新的一年里，创造更大成绩，献给社会主义建设事业。公社党委决定我们生产队由现在十一人增加到二十人，试验田由二十五亩增加到一百亩，争取平均每亩产量达到千斤。每人养猪一口，全队养鸡百只，养鱼四万尾，大搞编织、打柴等副业生产。在今年冬季生产中，我们要修渠道五百米，修理机井两眼，扩大小型水库三处，积肥、造肥七百万斤，春节前作到水利完工粪肥到地。我个人一定要听党的话，永远做党的好女儿，永远作大跃进的尖兵。
