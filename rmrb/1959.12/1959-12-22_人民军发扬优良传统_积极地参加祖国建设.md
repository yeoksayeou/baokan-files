　　人民军发扬优良传统  积极地参加祖国建设
    新华社河内21日电　自从越南停战以来，越南人民军积极参加越南北方的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，创造了巨大的成绩。
    在生产方面，为了保证农作物的收成，全军付出了六百四十万个劳动日，挖掘了四百九十九公里长的灌溉渠，九千四百个池塘和水井，灌溉田地三十二万四千多北越亩，并且以六十万个劳动日修筑了三十万土方的河堤。人民军官兵还付出了上十万个劳动日帮助农民犁田、耙地二万多北越亩，捕捉了三十万吨害虫，帮助农民收割稻田四万多北越亩，供给农民一万吨各种肥料。人民军也踊跃参加工厂和工地的劳动，大大推动了生产。
    在农业合作化运动中，人民军官兵对农民展开宣传教育，大批农民因而提高了觉悟，积极要求加入变工组和合作社。他们协助农民建立了包括有两万农户参加的两千个农业生产合作社，经常支援两万五百三十三个农业社和上千个变工组。
    在文化建设方面，人民军也有许多贡献。人民军动员了十万人参加文化学习，扫除文盲三万人，并帮助培养了二千名扫盲教师。军医部门曾经为五万人医治疾病。
    人民军发扬优良传统，积极参加工农业建设的事迹，获得越南人民的热烈赞扬。
