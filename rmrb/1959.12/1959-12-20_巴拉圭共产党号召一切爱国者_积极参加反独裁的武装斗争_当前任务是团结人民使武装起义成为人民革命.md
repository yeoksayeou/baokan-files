Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, December 18th: A delegation from the Steering Committee of the Paraguayan Communist Party issued a statement here on the current situation in Paraguay, calling on all Paraguayan patriots to actively support and participate in the armed struggle against the Stroessner dictatorship.

The statement said that on December 12th, some Paraguayan patriots held an armed uprising against Stroessner's bloody dictatorship. New armed revolutions are taking place in some parts of Paraguay. The insurgents are fighting against the dictatorship's army, and some insurgents are advancing into forest areas to develop guerrilla warfare. The people are enthusiastically receiving them, and volunteers are requesting weapons to join the fight. Workers have held massive general strikes, and workers and students have fought in the streets. In some places, farmers have taken up arms to fight for land, and the spirit of uprising has been widely promoted. The crisis of the dictatorship is deepening, and the situation foreshadows its collapse as the people's united struggle makes progress.

The statement said, "The current task is to do everything possible to make the armed struggle grow stronger, closely integrate it with the struggles of workers, peasants, students, and all the people, so that the armed uprising becomes a true people's revolution, fighting to destroy and completely eliminate the police-military regime, to fight for democratic land reform, to fight for the eradication of North American control in our country, and to fight for the restoration of national independence."

The statement called on democratic figures and patriots from the ruling National Republican Party and other parties, as well as male and female citizens, to immediately support the insurgents' liberation struggle, join insurgent groups or establish independent groups seeking unity, ensure consistent and militant leadership, oppose any compromise with the dictatorship, oppose the Organization of American States' conspiracy to interfere in favor of the dictatorship, and do everything possible to achieve national democratic unity.

The statement emphasized that the fundamental condition for achieving victory in the struggle is the unity of the entire people, regardless of political and religious beliefs. The statement called on all anti-dictatorial forces to take unified action immediately, strengthen the cooperation committees within the National Liberation United Front, and establish a broad patriotic front nationwide, doing everything possible to fight until the complete overthrow of the Stroessner dictatorship and the establishment of a democratic provisional government.

The statement pointed out that the people must not lay down their arms until the revolutionary democratic goals are achieved. The people must fight back against the dictatorship's mad acts of terror. Terror does not indicate its strength, but its weakness. The people must punish those who torture and murder political prisoners and detainees. The statement called on all the people to carry out a resolute and united struggle for the victory of complete freedom!

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, December 18th: The Central Command of the Paraguayan Anti-Dictatorial Armed Forces announced on the 18th that the anti-dictatorial forces have controlled the highway and railway linking the Paraguayan capital, Asunción, and the southern border city of Encarnación, preventing the movement of government troops.

The anti-dictatorial forces and government troops are still fighting on the eastern and southeastern borders. Argentina's "News Pictorial" quoted passengers on the Asunción-Buenos Aires international train as saying that fierce fighting broke out between the anti-dictatorial forces and government troops in southern Paraguay on the evening of the 18th, and the train was forced to stop a hundred and fifty kilometers outside of Asunción for several hours. According to broadcasts from the anti-dictatorial army radio station, another anti-dictatorial force landed on the banks of the Paraná River, west of Encarnación, on the 18th. The radio station said that the force went straight inland without encountering resistance.

According to Argentina's "Racional Newspaper," a total of twenty-seven columns of anti-dictatorial troops have entered Paraguay so far, and these troops are moving northwest. At the same time, the first batch of women guerrillas also participated in the battle.

According to an earlier announcement by the Anti-Dictatorial Army Headquarters, the Anti-Dictatorial Army has captured eight more towns and occupied Puerto Stroessner, bordering Brazil, and Coronel Oviedo, a city 150 kilometers west of the capital. The anti-dictatorial armed forces have renamed Puerto Stroessner as "May 14th" Port (Paraguay gained independence on May 14, 1811).

It is reported that many volunteers have joined the ranks of the anti-dictatorial army. One hundred workers from a pulp factory in the Argentine border city of Posadas participated in the anti-dictatorial armed forces.

    巴拉圭共产党号召一切爱国者
    积极参加反独裁的武装斗争
    当前任务是团结人民使武装起义成为人民革命
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯18日电  巴拉圭共产党指导委员会代表团在这里就巴拉圭目前的形势发表了一项声明，号召巴拉圭一切爱国者积极支持和参加反对斯特罗斯纳独裁政权的武装斗争。
    声明说，12月12日，一些巴拉圭爱国者举行武装起义反对斯特罗斯纳的血腥独裁统治。新的武装革命在巴拉圭国内的一些地方发生。起义者正在同独裁政权的军队作战，一部分起义者正向森林地带前进以便发展游击战，人民热情地接待他们，志愿人员要求武器以便参加战斗。工人举行了规模巨大的总罢工，工人和学生在街上进行了战斗，有些地方农民已经拿起了武器争取土地，起义的精神已经普遍地发扬起来。独裁政权的危机日益深重，形势预示着它将在人民联合斗争取得进展的情况下垮台。
    声明说，“当前的任务是想尽办法使武装斗争成长壮大，同工人、农民、学生和全体人民的斗争紧密结合起来，以便使武装起义成为真正的人民革命，为争取摧毁和彻底消灭警察军事政权，争取民主土地改革，争取铲除北美在我国的控制，争取恢复民族独立而斗争。”
    声明号召执政党国家共和党和其他各党派的民主人士和爱国人士以及男女公民立即支持起义者的解放斗争，参加起义团体或建立谋求统一的独立团体，保证始终如一的具有战斗性的领导，反对同独裁政权的任何妥协，反对美洲国家组织进行有利于独裁统治的干涉阴谋，竭尽全力，实现民族民主的团结。
    声明强调指出，取得斗争胜利的根本条件是全国人民不分政治和宗教信仰的团结一致。声明号召所有的反独裁力量立即采取统一行动，在民族解放联合阵线之内加强各协作委员会，并成立全国范围的广泛的爱国阵线，竭尽全力进行斗争，直至彻底推翻斯特罗斯纳独裁统治，建成民主的临时政府。
    声明指出，在没有实现革命的民主目标以前，人民决不能放下武器。人民必须还击独裁统治的疯狂的恐怖手段，恐怖手段并不表明它的强大，而是表明它的软弱。人民必须惩处拷打和谋杀政治犯和被囚禁者的那些人。声明号召全体人民为争取彻底自由的胜利而进行坚决的联合斗争！
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯18日电巴拉圭反独裁武装部队中央指挥部18日宣布，反独裁部队已经控制了联结巴拉圭首都亚松森和南部边境城市恩卡尔纳松之间的公路和铁路，阻止了政府军的调动。
    反独裁部队和政府军仍在东部和东南部边境作战。阿根廷“新闻画报”援引乘坐亚松森—布宜诺斯艾利斯国际火车的旅客的话说，18日晚反独裁部队和政府军在巴拉圭南部发生了激烈的战斗，火车被迫在离亚松森一百五十公里以外的地方停了数小时。据反独裁军电台广播，18日又有一支反独裁部队在恩卡尔纳松以西巴拉那河岸的一个小港登陆，电台说，这支队伍直入内地，没有遇到抵抗。
    据阿根廷“理性报”报道，到目前为止，进入巴拉圭的反独裁军一共有二十七个纵队，这些部队正在向西北部移动。同时，第一批妇女游击队也参加了战斗。
    据反独裁军司令部早些时候宣布，反独裁军又攻克了八个城镇，并且占领了与巴西接壤的斯特罗斯纳港和首都西部一百五十公里的科罗内耳奥维多城。反独裁武装已经把斯特罗斯纳港改名为“5月14日”港（巴拉圭在1811年5月14日获得独立）。
    据报道，许多志愿人员加入了反独裁军的队伍。阿根廷边境城市波萨达斯木浆工厂的一百名工人参加了反独裁武装。
