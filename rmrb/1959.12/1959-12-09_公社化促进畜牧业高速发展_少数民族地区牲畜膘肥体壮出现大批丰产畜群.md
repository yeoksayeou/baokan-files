Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Thanks to the efforts of people's communes in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu and other minority areas over the past year, animal husbandry production has embarked on a prosperous road of high-speed development.

Livestock of all kinds in these areas are generally fat and strong, and most areas have done a good job in preparing to protect livestock safely through the winter and spring, and have done so early.

The net increase rate of livestock in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region this year reached 14.51%. In order to strive for greater development of animal husbandry next year, pastoral and rural areas of the autonomous region have launched a new production upsurge of "guaranteeing 100 offspring from 100 mothers." In Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region this year, the survival rate of livestock such as horses, cattle, sheep, and camels reached 83.67%, and the net increase rate increased from 8.63% last year to 12.28%. In Qinghai this year, basically all eligible female livestock on the grasslands are fully bred, and the first-class fatness of livestock has reached more than 90%, an increase of 20% over the same period last year. While grasping the work of protecting livestock through the winter, the people's communes are further arranging labor, continuing to vigorously grasp the protection of fat and pregnancy, lambing and rearing, vigorously carrying out winter breeding, and launching mass movements for high-yield production of ten thousand sheep and ten thousand lambs, ten thousand cattle and ten thousand calves, ten thousand horses and ten thousand foals from eligible female livestock. The existing sheep in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have increased by more than 42% compared with the end of last year, and the famous Tan Sheep and lambskin goats have increased by more than 47%. Gansu Province's activities of mowing grass, repairing pens, and protecting livestock through the winter this year started more than a month earlier than in previous years, and has stored 9 billion catties of feed grass, providing livestock with five to six months of winter and spring fodder. On the vast grasslands of Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, a new scene of unprecedented fatness and strength has emerged. Among the livestock in the state, the first-class fatness accounts for 96.5%; the pregnancy and full-term rate of 716,000 eligible female livestock has reached 91.5%, and a large-scale harvest of animal husbandry has appeared.

This year, a large number of high-yield livestock groups and special zones, counties, state-owned ranches, and people's communes with large-scale high-yield livestock have emerged, which is one of the characteristics of animal husbandry beginning to move towards high-speed development. This year, the number of livestock in Zhaosu County, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang, increased by 38% compared with last year; nine state-owned ranches in various regions have reached "ten thousand sheep and ten thousand lambs"; and many "thousand sheep and thousand lambs" pastoral teams and high-yield groups have emerged in various communes.

Countless facts show that the establishment of people's communes has laid an extremely reliable foundation for the high-speed development of animal husbandry. In the people's communes, land resources, labor force, and funds in pastoral areas have been rationally used, various effective production increase measures have been fully implemented, the level of feeding management has been greatly improved, and grassland construction, which was previously impossible to carry out, can now be done. Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, where the net increase rate of livestock reached 11% this year, gave play to the favorable conditions of the people's communes, measured and comprehensively planned the vast grasslands, implemented rotational grazing by group, season, and region, promoted advanced experiences such as grazing day and night, supplementary feeding at night, grazing in four corners, and patrolling grazing, and adopted various methods to promote fattening and estrus, and to supplement and fatten eligible female livestock. People's communes in the autonomous prefecture have purchased artificial insemination equipment, established breeding stations in every commune, and every team has breeding personnel.

After the realization of people's communes and the implementation of settled grazing in various pastoral areas, the past situation of single-operation animal husbandry economy has been changed. The principle of taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations has been implemented, which not only guarantees the stable and high-speed development of animal husbandry, but also greatly develops various productions. After many places established grain and feed bases, they changed the historical situation of long-term shortage of food for people and feed for livestock. In order to ensure the stable development of animal husbandry, the people's communes in various pastoral areas of Xinjiang have allocated about half of their labor force to form agricultural production teams this year, reclaiming wasteland, building farmland, constructing water conservancy, expanding planting areas, and striving for self-sufficiency in grain and feed. Ten counties in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province have achieved self-sufficiency in grain.

The development of animal husbandry in these famous pastoral areas is playing an increasingly significant role in supporting the socialist construction of the motherland and prospering the economic life of the local people of all ethnic groups. From 1953 to 1958, in the six years, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region supplied more than 5.2 million draft and edible livestock, 80 million catties of wool, 5.25 million animal skins, more than 3,700 tons of frozen meat, and a large number of livestock products such as milk powder, gelatin, lactose, and cream to various places. The animal husbandry economy accounts for a large proportion of the national economy in Xinjiang, and Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, Ili horses, and Yanqi horses produced here have continuously supported agricultural and animal husbandry production in various places. If the various livestock products sold to the state by Qinghai herdsmen in 1950 are taken as 100, this year they sold to the state, wool increased to 218.41; cowhide increased to 362.2; and camel hair increased to 2214.33.

    公社化促进畜牧业高速发展
    少数民族地区牲畜膘肥体壮出现大批丰产畜群
    据新华社讯　内蒙古、新疆、宁夏、青海、甘肃等少数民族地区，各人民公社经过一年多来的努力，使畜牧业生产走上高速度发展的繁荣道路。
    这些地区各种牲畜普遍膘肥体壮，其中大部地区保护牲畜安全过冬过春的准备工作，做得又早又好。
    内蒙古自治区今年的牲畜净增率达到14.51％。为了争取明年畜牧业的更大发展，自治区的牧区、农村都掀起了“百母保百仔”的新的生产高潮。新疆维吾尔自治区今年马、牛、羊、骆驼等牲畜繁殖成活率达83.67％，净增率由去年的8.63％提高到12.28％。青海草原今年各类适龄母畜基本上达到全配满怀，牲畜的一类膘达到90％以上，比去年同期提高20％。各人民公社在抓保畜过冬工作的同时，正进一步安排劳动力，继续狠抓保膘保胎、接羔育幼，大搞冬季配种，掀起了适龄母畜的万羊万羔、万牛万犊、万马万驹等高额丰产的群众运动。宁夏回族自治区现有的羊只，比去年年底净增42％以上，著名的滩皮羊和羔皮山羊净增47％以上。甘肃省今年打草修圈、保畜过冬的活动，比往年提前一个多月，已储备饲草九十亿斤，使牲畜有了五个月到半年的冬春草料。甘南藏族自治州的千里草原上，出现前所未有的满膘全壮的新景象，全州牲畜中，一类膘占96.5％；七十一万六千头适龄母畜，怀胎、满胎率达到91.5％，出现了畜牧业的大面积丰收。
    今年各地出现了大批的丰产畜群和大面积牲畜高额丰产的专区、县、国营牧场和人民公社，这是畜牧业开始走向高速度发展的特点之一。新疆的伊犁哈萨克自治州昭苏县今年牲畜头数比去年净增38％；有九个地区国营牧场达到了“万羊万羔”；各地公社还出现了许多“千羊千羔”的牧业队和高产群。
    无数事实表明，人民公社的建立，为畜牧业的高速度发展奠定了极为可靠的基础。在人民公社里，牧区的土地资源、劳动力、资金都得到合理使用，各种有效的增产措施得到全面地贯彻执行，饲养管理水平有了很大提高，过去没有力量进行的草原建设现在有条件办起来了。今年牲畜净增率达到11％的甘南藏族自治州，发挥人民公社的有利条件，对辽阔的草原进行了测量和全面规划，实行分群分季分区轮牧，推广了昼夜放牧、夜间补饲、四角放牧、巡回放牧等先进经验，并采取各种办法催膘催情，给适龄母畜补饲增膘。自治州各人民公社都购买了人工授精器械，社社建立了配种站，队队都有配种员。
    各牧区实现人民公社化和推行定居放牧后，改变了过去单一经营畜牧业经济的状况，执行以牧为主、农牧结合、发展多种经营的方针，不仅保证了畜牧业稳定的高速度发展，各项生产也得到很大发展。不少地方建立粮食饲料基地后，改变了历史上长期人缺口粮、牲畜缺饲料的状况。新疆各牧区人民公社为了保证畜牧业的稳定发展，今年都抽出一半左右的劳动力组成农业生产队，开荒造田，兴修水利，扩大播种面积，争取粮食饲料自给。青海省牧业区已有十个县实现了粮食自给自足。
    这些著名牧区畜牧业的发展，对支援祖国社会主义建设和繁荣当地各族人民的经济生活起着越来越显著的作用。从1953年到1958年的六年中，内蒙古自治区供应各地五百二十多万头役畜和食用畜、八千万斤绒毛、五百二十五万张畜皮、三千七百多吨冻肉和大量的乳粉、胳胶、乳糖、奶油等畜产品。畜牧业经济在新疆国民经济中占很大比重，这里出产的新疆细毛羊、伊犁马、焉耆马，不断支援了各地的农牧业生产。如果把青海牧民1950年卖给国家的各种畜产品作为100，今年他们卖给国家的羊毛就增加到218.41；牛皮增加到362.2；驼毛增加到2214.33。
