(Xinhua News Agency) Liaocheng City, Shandong Province, is using the methods of large-scale collaboration and mass campaigns for water conservancy construction. From mid-September to late November, in just over two months, it completed over six million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects, six times more than the same period last year.

On the agricultural capital construction front in Liaocheng City, 100,000 people have been concentrated this winter to carry out mass campaigns. Several teams are dividing up the work and cooperating, simultaneously constructing projects such as water diversion, field irrigation, roads, river networks, bridges, culverts, and sluice gates, achieving good results with a streamlined approach. For example, the Zhou Dian branch canal on the fourth main canal of the Weishan Irrigation Area is as long as eighty *li*, a large project requiring a lot of labor. Liaocheng City organized 30,000 commune members to cooperate in the construction, adopting a unified action and section-by-section responsibility approach, leveling the ground and opening up a large canal in just over half a month, completing a total of 1.7 million cubic meters of earthwork. For general field irrigation projects, the commune organizes teams and brigades to jointly construct them. The Donglv and Gougu production brigades of the Douhutun Commune, along with four other production brigades, suffered from drought for a long time due to poor soil quality and difficulty in digging wells. They had long wanted to open a canal to divert water from the Grand Canal in the east to irrigate the land, but the terrain was high in the west and low in the east, and the canal had to be dug one *zhang* and five *chi* deep to divert water. Such a large project was impossible to undertake in the past. After the autumn sowing this year, the commune organized 10,000 people to dig canals, level land, build terraced fields, build pumping stations, etc., and the water was diverted in ten days.

The city also adopted cooperation between communes and several production teams in the form of large collectives and small collectives, or several production teams established a cooperation zone for small-scale cooperation, and adopted the method of "commune-run and office-assisted" to build large-scale projects. These new forms of cooperation have all achieved practical results that are numerous, fast, good, and economical. For example, the Chenkou control gate on the fourth main canal of the Weishan Irrigation Area was invested in by the state last year at 230,000 yuan and completed in just over two months. The Daqiao control gate, which was built this winter, is the same size as the Chenkou control gate, but was built using the method of "commune-run and office-assisted," costing only 130,000 yuan and taking just over a month to complete.

Liaocheng City has a strict organizational structure and specific leadership experience in carrying out large-scale collaboration and mass campaigns for water conservancy:

First, persist in carrying out meticulous political and ideological work. Before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a few people attacked large-scale collaboration, saying that mass campaigns were "disorganized troops" with low efficiency and poor quality. In response to this idea, the Liaocheng Municipal Party Committee held a collaborative on-site meeting in Shazhen. Commune members used a large number of facts to show that places where large-scale collaboration had been done well in the past had achieved bumper harvests. During the autumn sowing this year, all places where collaboration was implemented sowed early and well. In the specific organization of mass campaigns, Party committees at all levels first handed over the plan, requirements, significance, time, and methods to the masses for repeated discussion and unified understanding. Each campaign team established Party and Youth League organizations as the core of the battle.

Second, adhere to the principles of mutual benefit and equal exchange. The collaborative work between communes or between brigades is generally based on the size of the benefit, with people contributing labor and materials accordingly. Some exchange labor, making up the difference with labor; some calculate wages according to labor and make up the difference with money; some exchange human and animal power; some exchange labor for materials and make up the difference with physical goods; some adopt the method of recording work points on account and repaying in installments, or several communes help a poor commune, and several teams help a poor team. The collaborative work between small teams is recorded by the brigade and divided evenly during distribution. The evaluation of work and recording of points for large campaigns is done by some groups contracting work by the piece, with daily evaluation and recording; some grade points according to the strength of the labor force, with fixed points recorded flexibly.

Third, unified planning and overall arrangement. Liaocheng City has adhered to the following four principles in this regard: ① Implement mass campaigns in a planned manner, comprehensively classify and rank agricultural tasks in each period, and determine the scope and plan of mass campaigns based on production needs and the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical. For large and medium-sized water conservancy projects or soil improvement of more than tens of thousands of *mu*, organize large-scale collaboration between communes. Other tasks, such as wheat field management and leveling the ground, are planned and acted upon uniformly by the commune and team, with the small team as the unit of operation. ② Arrange all agricultural tasks in a unified manner, taking care of both the front and the rear. Cadres, labor, animal power, and tools are divided into several groups to ensure that the normal production order of the production team is not affected during large-scale collaboration and mass campaigns. ③ Implement militarized organization, combat-oriented action, collectivized life, and democratized management. The original communes and teams are used as contracting units, and the original small teams are used as operating units, to avoid forming idleness and waste. ④ Adhere to contracted quotas, and implement time, quality, quantity, labor, leadership, personnel, and rewards and punishments for each project, contracting from top to bottom to the group.

Fourth, leaders take action and effectively improve the lives of the masses. The construction site canteen and rest sheds are supervised by dedicated personnel to ensure that the water conservancy army eats well and sleeps well; medical personnel make rounds of the construction site for medical treatment; film teams and song and dance teams also often work at the construction site.

    在互助互利和等价交换的原则下统一安排劳力
    聊城大兵团修水利调度有方
    两个多月完成六百多万土方，比去年同期多六倍
    本报讯　山东聊城市运用大协作和大兵团作战的方法进行水利建设，从9月中旬到11月下旬的两个多月内，共完成了六百多万土方的水利工程，比去年同期多六倍。
    在聊城市农田基本建设战线上，今冬集中了十万人实行大兵团作战。几路人马分工协作，同时兴修引水、田间灌溉、道路、河网、桥涵、闸门等工程，收到了一气呵成的好效果。例如位山灌区第四干渠上的周店分干渠，长达八十华里，工程大，用工多，聊城市就组织各公社三万社员协作修建，并采取统一行动、分段负责的办法，半个多月平地开出一条大干渠，共做了一百七十万土方。又如一般田间灌溉工程，则以社为单位组织队与队联合修建。斗虎屯公社的东吕、垢固等六个生产大队，因为土质不好，打井困难，长期受旱，早就想开一条干渠从东面引运河水浇地，但是地势西高东洼，干渠非开一丈五尺深不能引水。这样大的工程，过去根本没有能力兴修。今年秋种结束后，这个公社组织一万人挖渠、整地、打畦田、修建扬水站等等，十天就把水引过来了。
    全市还采取公社与几个生产队实行大集体和小集体之间的协作，或者由几个生产队建立一个协作区进行小范围的协作，以及采取社办公助的办法，兴建大型工程。这些协作的新形式，都收到了多快好省的实效。例如位山灌区第四干渠上的陈口节制闸，去年由国家投资二十三万元兴修，两个多月修成；今冬兴建的代桥节制闸，规模和陈口节制闸一样大，采取社办公助的办法兴修，只花了十三万元和一个多月的时间就竣工了。
    聊城市修水利实行大协作和大兵团作战，有一套严密的组织工作和具体领导的经验：
    第一、坚持进行细致的政治思想工作。在党的八届八中全会召开以前，曾有少数人攻击大协作，说什么大兵团作战是“乱兵上阵”，工效低，质量差。聊城市委针对这种思想，在沙镇召开了协作现场会议。社员用大量事实说明过去大协作搞得好的地方都得到丰收。今年秋种中，凡是实行协作的地方，都种得早、种得好。在大兵团作战的具体组织上，各级党委首先把计划、要求、意义以及时间、方法，交给群众反复讨论，统一认识；各个兵团都建立了党、团组织，作为战斗的核心。
    第二、坚持互助互利和等价交换的原则。公社与公社之间或是大队与大队之间的协作工，一般是根据受益大小，摊人兑料。有的换工互助，以工找齐；有的是按工计资，用钱找齐；有的是人畜力交换；有的是以工换料，实物找齐；有的是采取记工挂账，分期偿还的办法，或数社帮助一个穷社，数队帮助一个穷队。小队与小队之间的协作工，由大队记账，分配时取齐。大兵团的评工记分，有的小组按件包工，每天评后记账，有的根据劳力强弱分级定分，死分活记。
    第三、统一规划，全面安排。聊城市在这方面坚持执行了四项原则：①有计划地实行大兵团作战，每个时期全面进行农活分类排队，根据生产需要和多快好省的原则，确定大兵团作战的范围和计划。凡是进行大中型水利工程或几万亩以上的土壤改良，都组织社与社之间的大协作。其他如麦田管理、平地整畦等，则以社、队为单位统一计划，统一行动，以小队为单位作战。②各项农活统一安排，前方后方全面照顾。干部、劳力、畜力、工具分成几个班子，保证在实行大协作、大兵团作战时，不影响生产队的正常生产秩序。③实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化、管理民主化，组织时以原来的社队为包工单位，以原来的小队为作战单位，以免形成窝工浪费。④坚持包工定额，每项工程都执行定时、定质、定量、定工、定领导、定人员、定奖惩，从上到下一包到组。
    第四、领导动手，切实搞好群众生活。工地食堂、休息工棚，都设有专人照管，保证水利大军吃好、睡好；医务人员在工地巡回医疗；电影队和歌舞队也常到工地工作。（附图片）
