Forever Crimson
— Excerpts from Du Fengrui's Diary

August 12, 1956

    The Party is the party of the Chinese working class. It is the liberator of the Chinese working people. From the day it was born, it has always fought heroically and unyieldingly for the liberation of all the oppressed. Without the Communist Party, there would be no liberation of the working people, no victory today. … I have the courage to accept the Party's strict test of me, to make myself a strong soldier in the revolutionary ranks. I have a firm determination to fight to the end for the Party's great goal—communism!

August 22, 1956

    Since coming to the ×× Regiment, I have been determined to work and study hard and strive to join the Chinese Communist Party.

    I can complete all kinds of learning tasks conscientiously, but self-study is poor. I have not violated any discipline in the air or on the ground and can do the prescribed actions. Since the accident, my thinking has fluctuated greatly, and I am considering whether causing such a great loss to the Party will affect my future Party membership. I am not careful when speaking, which sometimes affects unity.

    In the future, I should continue to strengthen my organizational discipline, fight against violations of law and discipline, strictly observe air and ground discipline, and obey commands. Do a good job of ground preparation, improve flight quality, ensure safety, and eliminate accidents. Strive to study politics, carry out ideological struggle and criticism and self-criticism. Strengthen unity and learn with humility.

October 17, 1956

    I deeply realize that to do every job, complete every task, and even carry out every study, it is necessary to listen to the Party, listen to the leaders, and seek the help and support of the leaders. Whatever the Party and leaders tell us to do, we should do it unreservedly according to the instructions of the Party and leaders. In this way, no matter how great the difficulties, there are ways to overcome them, and even the most arduous tasks can be completed. Conversely, if we are divorced from the leadership and do not listen to the leaders, and only rely on our personal wishes to do things, and only rely on our personal abilities to do things, we will absolutely not do well, and may even make mistakes. What is the reason why some people are slow to make ideological progress and have poor work performance? I think there is only one reason, and that is that they think they are right, do not rely on the leadership, do not listen to the leadership, and cannot correct their mistakes even when they are wrong, and cannot sincerely accept the correct opinions of the leadership. I deeply realize that relying on the Party can lead to progress, otherwise, one will fall behind.

May 10, 1957

    Every revolutionary, when he enters the revolutionary ranks, must first establish a firm and unwavering revolutionary outlook on life, that is, to clarify what you will do in society in your life? Is it to engage in revolution, or to be a muddle-headed person? That is, to determine the purpose of one's life.

    What we need is the proletarian revolutionary outlook on life, that is, the communist outlook on life. To establish such an outlook on life, we must pay attention to cultivating our ideological and moral qualities, thinking about the interests of the Party and the interests of the people everywhere, and have a selfless and self-sacrificing style. We must have collectivist thinking, put collective interests above personal interests, and be able to sacrifice our own lives for the interests of the Party and the collective. Otherwise, one is an individualist, a bourgeois outlook on life, and not a true communist.

December 29, 1957

    We cannot have a lenient attitude towards rightists outside the Party, and we cannot have a lenient attitude towards rightists within the Party. Everyone knows that fortresses are most easily captured from within. If the core of the Party disintegrates and the leadership of the proletariat is lost, the fortress can be broken without a fight. In order to prevent the Party's body from being corroded by rightists, and to maintain the Party's ideological and political purity, it is necessary to wage a struggle against rightists inside and outside the Party in the same way.

April 8, 1958

    After a person is born into the world, apart from those who die young, they will always live for decades. The decades of life from adulthood until the time of stopping breathing constitute each person's own history. As for whether the colors painted on each person's own historical picture are white, gray, pink, or crimson, although objective factors play a certain role, subjective factors play a decisive role. Everyone is writing their own history every moment. Every Party member and Communist Youth League member should think carefully about how to write their own history. Every Party member and Communist Youth League member should always use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as their guide to thought and action, and truly achieve consistency between words and deeds. I want to always keep the crimson color of my own history.

    永远鲜红
    ——杜凤瑞日记片断
    一九五六年八月十二日
    党是中国工人阶级的党，她是中国劳动人民的解放者，她从诞生那一天起，就始终为着解放一切被压迫者而进行英勇不屈的斗争。没有共产党就没有劳动人民的解放，就没有今天的胜利。……我有勇气接受党对我的严格考验，使自己在革命队伍中成为一个坚强的战士。我有坚定的决心为党的远大目标——共产主义奋斗到底！
    一九五六年八月二十二日
    自从到××团以来，自己就抱定决心，一定要很好地工作、学习，争取加入中国共产党。
    对各种学习任务都能认真完成，但是自学较差。在空中或地面没有违犯过纪律，都能按规定动作去做。自从发生了事故以后，思想波动较大，考虑给党造成这么大的损失对今后入党问题是否有影响。说话不注意，有时影响团结。
    今后我应继续加强组织性纪律性，向违法乱纪现象作斗争，严守空中地面纪律，听从指挥。作好地面准备，提高飞行质量，保证安全，消灭事故。努力学习政治，开展思想斗争和批评与自我批评。加强团结，虚心学习。
    一九五六年十月十七日
    我深刻认识到，做每一件工作，完成每一项任务，哪怕是进行每一次学习，都十分需要听党的话，听领导的话，争取领导的帮助和支持。党和领导上叫怎样去做，就不折不扣地按党和领导上的指示去做。这样就是有再大的困难，也有办法克服，再艰巨的任务也能完成。相反，如果脱离了领导，不听领导上的话，光凭个人的心愿去做事情，光凭个人的本领去做事情，是绝对做不好的，甚至要犯错误。有些人思想进步慢，工作成绩差，是什么原因造成的呢？我认为，原因只有一个，这就是自以为正确，不靠拢领导，不听从领导，明明自己看法错了也不能改正，明明领导的意见正确也不能诚恳接受。我深深体会到，依靠党才能进步，否则就要落后。
    一九五七年五月十日
    每一个革命者，当他一进入革命行列的时候，就首先要确立坚定不移的革命人生观，也就是说要明确，你这一生在社会上要做些什么？是干革命，还是做一个糊涂虫？也就是要确定自己一生的目的。
    我们需要的是无产阶级的革命人生观，也就是共产主义人生观。要树立这样的人生观，就必须注意培养自己的思想道德品质，处处为党的利益和人民群众的利益着想，具有大公无私、舍己为人的风格。要有集体主义思想，把集体利益放在个人利益上面，要能够为了党的利益，为了集体的利益，不惜牺牲自己生命。否则，就是个人主义者，就是资产阶级的人生观，就不是真正的共产主义者。
    一九五七年十二月二十九日
    我们对党外的右派不能有温情主义，对党内的右派分子同样不能有温情主义。谁都知道，堡垒最容易从内部夺取。如果党的核心瓦解了，无产阶级领导权丧失了，堡垒就可以不攻自破了。为了使党的肌体不被右派分子腐蚀，为了保持党在思想上、政治上的纯洁，必须对党内外的右派分子，一视同仁地展开斗争。
    一九五八年四月八日
    一个人出生到世界上来以后，除了早夭的以外，总要活上几十年。每个人从成年一直到停止呼吸的时候几十年的生活，就构成各人自己的历史。至于各人自己的历史画面上所涂的颜色是白的、灰的、粉红的或者是鲜红的，虽然客观因素起一定作用，但主观因素却起决定性的作用。每个人每时每刻都在写自己的历史。每个党员和共青团员都应当好好地想一想，怎样来写自己的历史。每个党员和共青团员时时刻刻都要以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来作自己的思想行动的指导，真正做到言行一致。我要永远保持自己历史的鲜红颜色。
