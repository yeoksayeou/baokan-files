The mess halls have dining rooms, and the dining rooms have stoves. The Yitou Commune has made ample preparations for grain, vegetables, firewood, and coal.

(Reported by our newspaper) As the severe winter approaches, the dining rooms of the public mess halls in the Yitou People's Commune, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, have been renovated. Sufficient fuel and vegetables have been stored, and additional cold-weather and heating equipment has been added for the commune members, ensuring that they can eat hot and nutritious meals.

Currently, the commune has prepared 11,920,000 catties of coal and 3,400,000 catties of firewood for cooking and heating during the winter. This fuel can meet the needs of all 82 public mess halls in the commune for cooking and heating the dining rooms throughout the winter. The more than 3,000 households of commune members have an average of more than 3,000 catties of coal and more than 1,300 catties of firewood stored per household, which is sufficient for winter cold protection and heating. The 375 kitchens and dining rooms of the public mess halls throughout the commune that lacked doors and windows have been universally renovated. Ninety-one new simple dining rooms have been built. In these dining rooms, some have built stoves, and some have built ground-level fires, truly achieving "every hall has a dining room, and every room has a stove." In order to take care of the elderly, children, and lactating women, special heated brick beds have been built for them in the dining rooms. The mess halls have prepared more than 1,000 insulated food buckets and lunch boxes to ensure that some commune members who are temporarily away from work can also eat hot meals. The commune members are very satisfied with these measures.

In order to ensure that there are sufficient potatoes and vegetables even during the cold days, the entire commune has stored more than 2,700,000 catties of various fresh vegetables and wild vegetables, and more than 3,200 vats of pickled vegetables, averaging 848 catties of various vegetables per household of commune members. In order to prevent these vegetables from freezing and reduce spoilage and loss, each mess hall has newly dug more than 1,200 vegetable cellars. When the vegetables were put into the cellars, the commune members carefully sorted them, putting the good ones into the cellars and picking out the damaged or rotten ones for processing.

In arranging the winter work of the public mess halls, the Yitou People's Commune conscientiously implemented the policy of running the mess halls diligently and thriftily, achieving simplicity and making use of local materials, spending less money and accomplishing more. In storing fuel, they made full use of the local natural conditions. The management areas near the coal mines transported coal, those near the mountains gathered firewood, and those in the plains collected thatch, dug up stubble, and gathered leaves, making full use of everything that could be burned. In order to solve the contradiction of insufficient transportation capacity between fuel preparation and various production tasks, they implemented a combination of delivering grain, delivering goods, and hauling coal, a combination of going to the fields to work and bringing firewood home, and a combination of plowing the land and picking up stubble.

    食堂有饭厅　厅内有火炉
    冶头公社粮菜柴煤准备充足
    本报讯　随着严寒冬季的到来，山西陵川县冶头人民公社公共食堂的饭厅都修饰一新，贮备了充足的燃料和蔬菜，为社员们增设了防寒取暖设备，做到饭菜吃热吃好。
    现在，这个公社已经准备了冬季做饭取暖的煤炭一千一百九十二万斤，柴火三百四十万斤。这些燃料可以满足全社八十二个公共食堂一冬做饭和饭厅取暖的需用；全社三千多户社员，平均每户储有煤炭三千多斤，柴火一千三百多斤，足够一冬防寒取暖用。全社公共食堂缺门少窗的三百七十五间厨房、饭厅，普遍进行了整修。新修九十一间简易饭厅，在这些饭厅里，有的盘起了火炉，有的筑下了地火，真正做到了“堂堂有饭厅，室室有火炉”。为了照顾老人、幼儿、哺乳妇女，专门为他们在饭厅内盘上火炕；食堂里准备了一千多个保温的饭桶和饭盒，保证一些因工作临时外出的社员也能吃到热饭。社员们对这些措施都非常满意。
    为了保证在严寒的日子里同样有足够的薯类和蔬菜，全公社共储备了各种鲜菜、野菜二百七十多万斤，腌菜三千二百余缸，平均每户社员有各种蔬菜八百四十八斤。为了使这些蔬菜不受冻，减少腐烂和损耗，各个食堂新挖一千二百多个菜窖。在蔬菜入窖的时候，社员们做了细心的挑拣，好的入窖，有伤的或腐烂的拣出加工处理。
    冶头人民公社在安排公共食堂过冬的工作中，认真贯彻了勤俭办食堂的方针，做到了因陋就简就地取材，少花钱多办事。在贮备燃料中，充分利用当地的自然条件，各管理区靠近煤矿的运煤，靠山的打柴，平川的拾茅柴、刨茬子、树叶，只要能烧的都充分利用起来。为了解决备燃和各项生产之间运输力量不足的矛盾，他们实行了送粮、送货和拉煤炭相结合，上地劳动和回家捎柴相结合、翻地和拾茬子相结合的方法。
