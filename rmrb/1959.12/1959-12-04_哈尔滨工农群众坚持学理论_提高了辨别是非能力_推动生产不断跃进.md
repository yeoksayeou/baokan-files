Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 3rd: The broad masses of workers and peasants in Harbin are actively studying Chairman Mao's works and the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism. Currently, approximately one million workers, peasants, salespersons, and soldiers in the city are participating in the study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the study of basic Marxist-Leninist theory.

In Harbin, 54,000 people have persisted in long-term systematic theoretical study since 1958. There are currently over 3,000 workers' and peasants' study groups for Chairman Mao's works, philosophy, political economy, party history, etc. The Dong Cunrui group at the Harbin Heping Sugar Factory has persisted in theoretical study and reading the newspaper for five years. The philosophy group at the Seventh Department Store has also explored a set of learning methods combining "study, question, think, write, speak, and apply" in their self-study process. Over the past year, they have written more than 80 theoretical articles and given over 90 lectures to schools, factories, residents, and other groups. Recently, they collectively wrote a first draft of a book entitled "Research on Shop Assistant Work" in conjunction with their work.

In the process of workers and peasants studying theory, a number of activists have emerged throughout the city, forming a team of approximately 400 worker-peasant theory instructors. These instructors are able to popularize and explain Marxist-Leninist theory in an easy-to-understand manner. Since the beginning of this year, they have written many theoretical articles, with more than 200 published in central, provincial, and municipal newspapers and magazines alone.

After more than a year of political and theoretical study, the broad masses of workers and peasants in Harbin have raised their socialist consciousness and their ability to distinguish right from wrong on major issues. They are actively applying the theory they have learned to production and work. In the first half of this year, the Third Workshop of the Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory launched a "high quality, high yield" red flag competition. Some people believed that "high quality cannot go hand in hand with high yield." Under the leadership of the Party branch, the workshop workers used philosophical theory to launch a great debate against the above erroneous views, enabling the entire workshop to improve its understanding of the General Line of Going All Out, Aiming High, and Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results in Building Socialism, thereby promoting production.

    哈尔滨工农群众坚持学理论
    提高了辨别是非能力  推动生产不断跃进
    新华社哈尔滨3日电　哈尔滨市广大工农群众积极学习毛主席著作和马克思列宁主义的基础理论。目前，全市大约有上百万工人、农民、营业员和士兵参加了党的八届八中全会文件学习和马克思列宁主义基础理论学习。
    哈尔滨市有五万四千人从1958年起，就坚持了长年的系统理论学习。全市现有毛主席著作、哲学、政治经济学、党史等工农群众学习小组共三千多个。哈尔滨和平糖厂董存瑞小组已经坚持了五年理论学习和读报。第七百货商店哲学小组还在自修过程中摸索出一套“学、问、想、写、讲、用”相结合的学习方法，他们一年来共写了八十多篇理论文章，外出给学校、工厂、居民等讲课九十多次，最近他们又结合业务集体写成了“售货员工作研究”一书的初稿。
    在工农群众学习理论中，全市还涌现出了一批积极分子，形成了一支四百人左右的工农理论教员队伍。这些教员能够通俗地宣传和讲解马列主义理论。今年以来，他们写了很多理论性文章，仅在中央、省、市报刊上发表的就有二百多篇。
    经过一年多时间的政治理论学习，哈尔滨市的广大工农群众提高了社会主义觉悟和辨别大是大非的能力，他们主动地把学到的理论运用到生产、工作中去。哈尔滨第一工具厂三车间今年上半年开展“优质高产”红旗竞赛，有部分人认为
  “优质不能高产”。车间工人就在党支部领导下，运用哲学理论针对以上错误观点展开了一场大辩论，使全车间提高了全面贯彻鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的认识，促进了生产。（附图片）
