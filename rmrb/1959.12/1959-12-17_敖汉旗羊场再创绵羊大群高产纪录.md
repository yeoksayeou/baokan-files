    Aohan Banner Sheep Farm, a national red banner unit for high-yield and high-quality livestock in Inner Mongolia, has set a new record for large-scale high-yield sheep production for two consecutive years. Last year, the survival rate of lambing reached 120.5%, which was rewarded by the Central Ministry of Agriculture. This year, the survival rate of lambing at this sheep farm has further increased to 132.2%, which is about 40% higher than the lambing survival rate of the high-yield sheep flocks in the local people's commune.

    Aohan Banner Sheep Farm is located in the southeast of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. When the sheep farm was established in 1951, it only had 320 Mongolian ewes. In the past eight years, the number of sheep has increased more than 26 times, and sideline production such as cattle, horses, pigs, and chickens has also been developed. This year, the entire farm has achieved breed standardization and complete improvement of sheep breeds.

    In the process of achieving high yield and high quality sheep flocks, the staff of Aohan Banner Sheep Farm have fully demonstrated the communist spirit. Since 1955, the staff has boldly tried to inject pregnant mare serum (used to stimulate estrus in ewes and increase ovulation) into ewes, combined with improved grazing and short-term feeding of concentrated feed, which has gradually increased the lambing rate of ewes. This year, more than 900 ewes on the farm gave birth to twins, triplets and quadruplets; among them, the "high-yield flock" composed of 100 ewes produced 194 lambs, with 191 surviving, an increase of 677% in the lambing rate compared with last year's high-yield flock.

    敖汉旗羊场再创绵羊大群高产纪录
    本报讯　全国畜牧业高产优质红旗内蒙古敖汉旗羊场，连续两年创造绵羊大群高额丰产纪录，去年绵羊繁殖成活率达到120.5％，受到中央农业部奖励。今年，这座羊场的绵羊，繁殖成活率更提高到132.2％，比当地人民公社绵羊高产群的繁殖成活率高出40％左右。
    敖汉旗羊场位于内蒙古自治区的东南部。1951年建立羊场的时候，只有三百二十只蒙古种母绵羊。八年来，绵羊增长二十六倍多，还发展了牛、马、猪、鸡等副业生产。今年，全场绵羊已实现良种定型和全部改良化。
    在实现羊群高产优质过程中，敖汉旗羊场职工们充分发挥了共产主义风格。从1955年开始，职工们大胆地试用给母绵羊注射妊娠马血清（用来刺激母羊发情和使母羊多排卵）结合改进放牧、短期饲喂精料等措施，使母羊产羔率逐步上升。今年全场有九百多只母羊产了双羔、三羔和四羔；其中由一百只母羊组成的“高产群”，产羔一百九十四只，成活一百九十一只，比去年高产群产羔率提高了677％。
