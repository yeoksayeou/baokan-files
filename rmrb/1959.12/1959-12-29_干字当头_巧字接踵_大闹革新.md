Taking "Hard Work" as the Top Priority, "Skill" Following Closely – Vigorously Engage in Innovation
	Wang Feng'en, National Advanced Producer, Engineer of Shenyang Transformer Factory

	1960 has arrived. Now, everywhere are red and green celebratory reports, everywhere are triumphant gongs and drums, truly a flourishing and prosperous scene.

	Under the wise leadership of the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, this year we have once again achieved great victories on the foundation of the Great Leap Forward of 1958. The abundant fruits of the leap forward picked on all fronts are as numerous as the stars in the sky. Take the Shenyang Transformer Factory as an example! We have completed the annual national plan forty-one days ahead of schedule, with high yield, high quality, conservation, and safety blooming luxuriantly. The output of transformers has increased by 49% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

	This achievement is the result of the Party leading us in vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. For example, in the past, our insulation workshop only had four pieces of equipment, and many tasks had to be done with scissors and hand hammers. This year, under the leadership of the Party, we vigorously engaged in technical innovation, transforming the entire workshop from 70% manual operation in the past to 84.2% mechanized production. The workshop saw the emergence of a large number of self-made machines and equipment such as pipe rolling machines, electric oil filtering machines, presses, and combined automatic paper cutting machines, replacing the original manual operations. This year's production capacity has tripled compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. In August, our workshop accepted the important task of manufacturing a batch of 220,000-volt high-voltage bushings. This type of high-voltage bushing requires complex technology and has a very short production period, encountering difficulties such as insufficient equipment, tools, ovens, and manpower. The Party committee led us in vigorously engaging in technical innovation and mechanizing the production of high-voltage bushings. The Party Secretary, Factory Director, Chief Engineer, and other leading comrades personally helped us solve various difficulties encountered in the process of technical innovation, and finally developed an automatic pipe cutting device, completing this task ahead of schedule.

	In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and the help of comrades, I have successively realized more than 230 innovation and creation projects. These achievements are very small. However, the Party and the masses have given me great encouragement and honor, promoting me from a worker to a foreman, technician, and engineer, and also allowing me to serve concurrently as a university professor. Recalling the old society, I was a child laborer kicked onto the streets and unemployed by the capitalists. If it were not for the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, if it were not for our good socialist society, how could there have been all of this?

	Some people asked me, what are my plans for 1960? My answer is very simple: I will do whatever the Party wants me to do. Now that the Party has sent me to lead a technical innovation team, I have already finalized the plan with everyone, focusing on various key production aspects and proposing 500 innovation projects. In the work, although we will encounter some specific difficulties, we will take "hard work" as the top priority, with "skill" following closely, and we are determined to make the difficulties bow their heads. In this year, we are determined to fully mechanize and partially automate the production in the insulation workshop, allowing production to increase and increase again, and the leap forward to leap forward again!

　　干字当头　巧字接踵　大闹革新
    全国先进生产者沈阳变压器厂工程师  王凤恩
    1960年到来了。现在到处是红绿喜报，到处是胜利锣鼓，真是一片欣欣向荣的大好景象。
    在党和伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，今年我们又在1958年大跃进的基础上，取得了伟大的胜利。各个战线上摘下的跃进硕果，多得像天上的星星。就拿沈阳变压器厂来说吧！我们已经提前四十一天完成了全年国家计划，高产、优质、节约、安全四花怒放；变压器的产量比大跃进的1958年提高了49％。
    这个成就是党领导我们大搞技术革新和技术革命的结果。例如，过去我们绝缘车间只有四台设备，很多活要用剪刀、手锤去干。今年我们在党的领导下大搞技术革新，使全车间由过去70％的手工操作，变为84.2％的机械化生产。车间里出现了卷管机、电动滤油机、压力机、联合式自动裁纸机等一大批自己制造的机器设备，代替了原来的手工操作。今年的生产能力比大跃进的1958年提高了三倍。8月间，我们车间接受了制造一批二十二万伏高压套管的重要任务。这种高压套管技术要求复杂，生产期限很短，发生了设备、工具、烘炉和人力不足的困难。党委领导我们大闹技术革新，大搞生产高压套管机械化。党委书记、厂长、总工程师等领导同志，亲自帮助我们解决技术革新过程中遇到的各种困难，终于研究出一种切管自动装置，提前完成了这一任务。
    这几年来在党的领导和同志们的帮助下，我先后实现了二百三十多项革新创造。这些成绩是很微小的。但党和群众却给了我极大的鼓励和荣誉，把我从一个工人提升为工长、技术员、工程师，还让我兼任大学教授。回想在旧社会里，我是一个被资本家一脚踢上街头、流浪失业的童工。要是没有党和毛主席的领导，要是没有我们这个社会主义好社会，又怎么会有这一切呢？
    有人问我，1960年我有什么打算？我的回答很简单：党要我干什么我就干什么。现在党派我带领一支技术革新大队，我已经和大伙把规划都订妥了，对准各种生产关键，提出了五百项革新项目。在工作中，虽然会遇到一些具体困难，但是我们干字当头，巧字接踵，定叫困难低头。在这一年里，我们决心要使绝缘车间的生产全部机械化、部分自动化，让生产提高再提高，跃进再跃进！
