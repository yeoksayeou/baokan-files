Hebei Province Emerges with First Advanced High-Speed Pig Raising County
Xinle County Achieves One Pig Per Mu
All Levels of Secretaries Take the Lead, Vigorously Launching Mass Movements, Establishing Key Points at Each Level, Setting Up Pace-Setters in Every Commune, Conducting Competitions Everywhere; Public Raising as the Mainstay, Combining Public and Private; Widely Seeking Feed, Prevention More Important Than Cure
(Our Newspaper Tianjin, December 17th dispatch) Xinle County, Hebei Province, is raising pigs at high speed, taking the lead in the province to achieve the goal of one pig per mu.
By mid-December, statistics showed that the county had 1,060,521 pigs in pens, an average of 11 per household, 2.3 per person, and 1.04 per mu. The county's current number of pigs has increased by 2.42 times compared to 1958. In the past year, the county also sold 52,200 commodity pigs to the state and supported other areas with 370,000 piglets. The development of the pig raising industry has driven the overall leap forward of the entire animal husbandry industry. Under the slogan of "taking pigs as the key link and vigorously developing ten types of animal husbandry," the county added 45,795 head of large livestock in one year, an increase of 20.5% compared to 1958; poultry increased by 1.6 times, and sheep increased by 1.12 times.

Due to the rapid development of animal husbandry centered on pig raising, the amount of fertilizer accumulated has increased dramatically, and the quality has also improved. This year, each mu of cultivated land has been fertilized with 15 to 20 cartloads of manure, nearly double the amount compared to last year. Coupled with other production increase measures, this year's grain output increased by 25% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, with an average yield of 605 jin per mu; cotton increased by 33%; and peanuts increased by 30%. This county, which has been short of grain for many years, has become a surplus grain county this year. The development of the pig raising industry has increased the public accumulation of communes and teams and the personal income of commune members. From January to the end of November this year, the total income of the county's agricultural and sideline industries was 100,189,000 yuan, of which pig raising income accounted for 29.6% of the total.

Xinle County is a semi-mountainous, semi-plain area, with mountain slopes and sandy land accounting for about three-quarters of all cultivated land. Before liberation, the production level was very low, with an average yield of about 100 jin per mu, and the grain produced in one year was only enough for the county's people to eat for half a year. After liberation, grain output increased year by year, but the situation of grain shortage over the years has not been completely changed. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward last year, the people of the county made a firm determination to quickly change the face of poverty. Under the leadership of the county party committee, it was decided to raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer, improve sandy soil, and increase grain output. After the people's communes were established, the county quickly set off a pig raising upsurge. Last year, the number of pigs reached 310,000, an increase of 30% compared to 1957. This year, the county party committee formulated a leap forward plan for raising 600,000 pigs and mobilized party organizations at all levels to use comparison and accounting methods to conduct propaganda and education among the masses about the benefits of raising pigs for the country, the community, and themselves, to stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs.

In order to quickly push the development of the pig raising industry to a climax, the county vigorously launched a mass movement for pig raising, focusing on key points at each level, setting up pace-setters, and conducting competitions everywhere to catch up with the advanced. In addition to focusing on Anxiang Commune, the county party committee established a red flag for one pig per mu and fattening pigs with coarse feed. Different models were also established in different areas such as mountainous areas, plains, and sandy wasteland. Each commune also actively cultivated pig raising pacesetter teams. The county party committee and the commune party committees held 24 different types of on-site meetings to promote advanced experiences. At the same time, three mobile red flags for pig raising and fertilizer accumulation were made, and competitions were organized throughout the county between communes and communes, teams and teams, and farms and farms to compare development and consolidation, compare breeding and survival, compare feed and storage, and compare epidemic prevention and sanitation, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs.

Xinle County conscientiously implemented the policy of "public raising as the mainstay, private raising as a supplement, and walking on two legs." The county party committee put forward the slogan of "communes building 10,000-pig farms, teams building 1,000-pig farms, 'Fang Fang' (high-yield plots) building pig farms, and organs, groups, and schools all raising pigs." More than 2,000 collective pig farms were established in the county in three months. At present, the number of pigs collectively raised has reached more than 700,000, accounting for 66.5% of the total number of pigs raised. In order to encourage commune members to raise pigs, the county conscientiously implemented the policy of retaining feed land for commune members and helping commune members solve problems such as piglets, and also reserved time for commune members to feed pigs.

In the process of high-speed pig raising, Xinle County insisted on discussing with the masses and relying on the masses to solve various difficult problems. The shortage of piglets was the first problem. Xinle County adopted the method of mobilizing the masses to breed and raise their own pigs to solve it. On the one hand, cadres and party members were mobilized to take the lead in investing to buy some piglets first, and on the other hand, specific measures for the development of sows were formulated. These measures are: educating commune members to raise more sows; promoting double mating and re-mating methods to improve the breeding rate of sows; and appropriately increasing the price of piglets. As a result, the number of sows increased rapidly, reaching more than 259,000 by the end of November, an increase of more than four times compared to 1958.

With more pigs, the lack of feed was the second problem. The county party committee first clarified three bases (pig raising, existing feed, and feed sources), calculated three accounts (agricultural by-products, processing by-products, and how much wild feed can be collected), and summarized and promoted the advanced experience of Anxiang Commune in collecting 100 kinds of wild grass to raise pigs. People's communes were organized to universally adopt methods such as grazing, processing, and collecting to solve the feed problem, and a mass movement to vigorously store feed was also launched. At present, the county has stored more than 629 million jin of coarse feed, with an average of nearly 600 jin stored per pig. With pigs, pig pens and pig houses must be built. Where do the funds and materials come from? After consultation with the masses and the lead of cadres and party members, commune members invested materials worth more than 300,000 yuan in one month, and the number of collective pig farms quickly developed from 312 to 418. The county also conscientiously implemented the policy of "prevention more important than cure" and launched a mass epidemic prevention movement. The county established a veterinary hospital, communes set up veterinary stations, and teams had epidemic prevention personnel and health rooms, forming a complete livestock medical network throughout the county.

The county has particularly strengthened the leadership of the pig raising industry. The county, communes, and production teams have all added secretaries in charge of animal husbandry production. At all levels, the secretaries take the lead, absorbing the participation of relevant departments, and establishing animal husbandry production committees or groups to regularly study the situation and solve problems in a timely manner. From top to bottom, the leadership methods of "five packages" (county cadres package communes, commune cadres package management areas, management areas package teams, teams package farms, party members package households) and "six determinations" (determine leadership, determine tasks, determine time, determine strength, determine division of labor, determine rewards) are universally promoted.

    河北省出现第一个高速度养猪先进县
    新乐县做到一亩一头猪
    各级书记挂帅，大搞群众运动，层层建立重点，社社树立标兵，处处开展竞赛；公养为主、公私并举；广找饲料，防重于治
    本报天津17日电　河北省新乐县高速度养猪，在全省领先实现了一亩地一头猪的目标。
    到12月中旬统计，全县圈存猪达一百零六万零五百二十一头，平均每户十一头，每人二点三头，每亩地一点零四头。全县的现有猪数，比1958年增长了二点四二倍。一年来，全县还卖给国家商品猪五万二千二百头，支援外地仔猪三十七万头。养猪业的发展，带动了整个畜牧业的全面跃进。在以猪为纲，大兴十养的口号下，一年内就增添了大牲畜四万五千七百九十五头，比1958年增加20.5％，家禽增加了一点六倍，羊增加了一点一二倍。
    由于以养猪为中心的畜牧业的迅速发展，积肥量剧增、质量也好，今年每亩耕地施肥十五至二十车，比去年增加了近一倍。加上其他增产措施，今年的粮食产量比大跃进的1958年增长了25％，平均亩产六百零五斤；棉花增长了33％；花生增长了30％。这个历年缺粮的县份，今年变成了余粮县。养猪业的发展，增加了社、队的公共积累和社员个人收入。今年1至11月底，全县农副业总收入一亿零一百八十九万元，其中，养猪收入占总数的29.6％。
    新乐县是个半山、半平原的地区，山坡、沙地约占全部耕地的四分之三。解放前，生产水平很低，平均亩产百斤左右，一年生产的粮食，只够全县人民半年吃。解放后，粮食产量逐年提高，但历年缺粮的情况并未彻底改变。在去年大跃进的形势下，全县人民立下了迅速改变贫困面貌的雄心壮志。在县委领导下，决定养猪积肥，改良沙地土壤，提高粮食产量。人民公社化后，全县很快就掀起了一个养猪高潮，去年猪只就达到了三十一万口，比1957年增长了30％。今年，县委制定了养猪六十万头的跃进计划，并发动各级党组织用对比、算账的方法，向广大群众进行养猪利国、利社、利己的宣传教育，启发群众养猪的积极性。
    为了将养猪业的发展很快推向高潮，全县大搞养猪的群众运动，层层搞重点，树标兵，处处闹竞赛，赶先进。县委除以安香公社为重点，树立了一亩地一头猪和粗饲料育肥猪的红旗外，还在山地、平原、沙荒区不同地带，树起了不同样板。各公社也都积极培养了养猪标兵队。县委和公社党委分别召开了二十四次不同类型的现场会，推广先进经验。同时，还制了三面养猪积肥流动红旗，在全县范围内组织社与社、队与队、场与场开展了比发展看巩固，比繁殖看成活，比饲料看储存，比防疫看卫生的红旗竞赛，大大鼓舞了群众的养猪热情。
    新乐县认真贯彻了公养为主、私养为辅、两条腿走路的方针，县委提出了社建万猪场、队建千猪场、方方（丰产方）建猪场，机关、团体、学校都养猪的口号。全县在三个月中建立了二千多个集体养猪场，目前，集体饲养的猪已达到七十多万头，占养猪总数的66.5％。为鼓励社员养猪，这个县认真执行了留给社员饲料地的政策和帮助社员解决猪秧等问题，还给社员留出了喂猪时间。
    在高速度养猪过程中，新乐县坚持用和群众商量，依靠群众的办法解决各种困难问题。猪秧不足是第一个难题，新乐县采取发动群众自繁自养的办法来解决。一方面发动干部和党团员带头投资先买一些仔猪，一方面制定了发展母猪的具体措施。这些措施是：教育社员多养母猪；推广双重配和复配法，提高母猪繁殖率；适当提高仔猪价格。这一来，母猪迅速增加，到11月底就达到了二十五万九千多头，比1958年增长了四倍多。
    猪多了，饲料缺乏是第二个难题。县委首先摸清了三个底（养猪、现有饲料、饲料来源），算清了三笔账（农业副产品、加工副产品、能采多少野生饲料），并总结推广了安香公社采集百样野草养猪的先进经验，组织各人民公社普遍采取牧放、加工和采集等方法，解决饲料问题，还开展了大搞储备饲料的群众运动。到目前，全县已储备粗饲料六亿二千九百多万斤，每头猪已平均储备近六百斤。有猪就要建猪圈、猪舍，资金、物料哪里来？经过与群众商量和干部、党团员带头，一个月内，社员就投资投物料共折款三十多万元，集体养猪场很快由三百十二个发展到四百十八个。这个县还认真贯彻了“防重于治”的方针，发动群众大搞防疫运动。县建立了兽医院，公社设兽医站，队有防疫员和保健室，全县形成了一个完整的牲畜医疗网。
    这个县特别加强了对养猪业的领导。县、社、生产队都增设了专管畜牧生产的书记。各级都由书记挂帅，吸收各有关部门参加，成立了畜牧生产委员会或小组，定期研究情况，及时解决问题。从上到下，普遍推行了五包（县干部包社、社干部包管理区、管理区包队、队包场、党团员包户）、六定（定领导、定任务、定时间、定力量、定分工、定奖励）的领导方法。（附图片）
