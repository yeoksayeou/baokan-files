Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 26th -- A dispatch from our correspondent: Romania's electricity production by the end of this year will be close to the production level stipulated in the National Ten-Year Electrification Plan for next year (i.e., the final year of the plan). According to materials, Romania's electricity production this year will reach 6.85 billion kilowatt-hours, while the original plan stipulated that the annual electricity production should be 7 billion kilowatt-hours; it is expected that this task will be overfulfilled by 10% by the end of next year.

Achieving national electrification is one of the main goals of Romania's construction of a socialist economic base. The Romanian Workers' Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers, in the National Ten-Year Electrification Plan formulated in 1950, stipulated that the main tasks of electrification were to ensure electricity supply to socialist industry, rationally develop national electricity resources, expand electricity supply to rural areas, and meet the growing needs of residents for electricity. The realization of this plan will lay the foundation for the comprehensive electrification of industry and agriculture.

Since Romania began implementing the National Ten-Year Electrification Plan in 1951, it has achieved remarkable success. Now, the country's electricity production has been able to meet the needs of the industrial sector. The average electricity consumption per worker has increased from 3,089 kilowatt-hours in 1955 to 4,300 kilowatt-hours this year. This year, the average electricity production every sixty days is equal to the total production in 1938 before liberation.

The growth rate of electricity production in Romania is incomparable to that of many capitalist countries. From 1950 to 1959, its electricity production increased by an average of 14% per year; however, the major capitalist countries only increased by an average of 3%-7% per year during this period.

In the process of implementing the Ten-Year Electrification Plan, the clear trend in Romania's development of electricity production is to focus on establishing large-scale power stations. The average power generation capacity of power stations put into production during the First Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) was 25,000 kilowatts, while the power generation capacity of power stations designed and built in recent years is over 100,000 kilowatts in some cases. In order to fully meet the electricity demand of various sectors of the continuously developing national economy, it is necessary to build more and larger power stations in the future. The country's largest "Lenin" Hydropower Station is currently under construction and will be partially put into production next year, with a maximum power generation capacity of 210,000 kilowatts. According to an agreement signed between Romania and Czechoslovakia, the two countries will cooperate in Romania to build a thermal power station with a power generation capacity of 600,000 kilowatts.

Romania has abundant water resources. It is estimated that the country's rivers can be used to build hydropower stations with a total power generation capacity of 5.65 million kilowatts, which can generate 27.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The approximately 1,000-kilometer section of the Danube River flowing through Romania alone can produce 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity for it every year.

Now, Romania has a relatively developed electrical machinery industry, and its production capacity has increased more than fivefold from 1950 to 1959. (Attached picture)

After the completion of this hydropower station, the total power generation capacity will reach 210,000 kilowatts, and 430 million kilowatt-hours of electricity will be supplied annually to industry and urban and rural areas.

### 为实现工农业全面电气化打下巩固基础  罗十年电气化计划将超额完成  今年电力生产将达六十八亿五千万度接近明年计划指标

　　为实现工农业全面电气化打下巩固基础
    罗十年电气化计划将超额完成
    今年电力生产将达六十八亿五千万度接近明年计划指标
    新华社布加勒斯特26日电　本社记者报道；罗马尼亚今年的电力生产到年底将接近国家十年电气化计划为明年（即计划的最后一年）规定的生产水平。根据材料，今年罗马尼亚的电力生产将达到六十八亿五千万度，而原计划规定年的电力生产为七十亿度；预计，这个任务到明年底将超额10％完成。
    实现国家电气化是罗马尼亚建设社会主义经济基础的主要目标之一。罗马尼亚工人党中央和部长会议在1950年制定的国家十年电气化计划规定，电气化的主要任务是保证对社会主义工业的电力供应，合理地开发国家电力资源，扩大对农村的电力供应，满足居民对电力日益增长的需要。这一计划的实现将为工农业的全面电气化打下基础。
    罗马尼亚人民自1951年执行国家十年电气化计划以来，已经获得了显著成就。现在，全国的电力生产已经能够满足工业部门的需要。按工人人数平均计算的用电量已经从1955年的三千零八十九度增加到今年的四千三百度。今年，平均每六十天的电力产量就等于解放前1938年全年的产量。
    罗马尼亚电力生产的增长速度是许多资本主义国家所无法比拟的。从1950年1959年，它的电力生产平均每年增长14％；但是主要资本主义国家在这一时期平均每年只增长3％—7％。
    在执行十年电气化计划的过程中，罗马尼亚发展电力生产的明显趋势是着重建立大型发电站。在第一个五年计划（1951——1955年）期间投入生产的发电站的平均发电能力为二万五千瓩，而最近几年设计建立的发电站的发电能力，有些都在十万瓩以上。为了充分满足不断发展的国民经济各部门对电力的需求，今后还需要建立更多、规模更大的发电站。目前全国最大的“列宁”水电站正在加紧施工，将在明年部分投入生产，它的最大发电能力是二十一万瓩。根据罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克签订的协定，两国将在罗马尼亚合作建立一座发电能力六十万瓩的火电站。
    罗马尼亚有雄厚的水力资源，据估计，全国河流的水力可以用来建立发电能力共为五百六十五万瓩的水电站，每年可以发电二百七十二亿度。单是流经罗马尼亚境内的多瑙河的一段约一千公里的河水，每年就可以为它生产一百亿度电力。
    现在，罗马尼亚已有相当发达的电机工业，它的生产能力从1950年到1959年间就增加了五倍多。（附图片）
