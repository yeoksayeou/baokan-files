A kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization movement in canteens is unfolding in factories, mines, construction sites, people's communes, shops, institutions, and schools in Beijing. This is a good thing and a major event.

There are many benefits to realizing kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization.

First, it can liberate a large amount of labor and support the production front. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the great development of various construction undertakings and the rural people's communes, more and more people are eating in public canteens. Now, there are thousands of canteens in Beijing, with tens of thousands of cooks. The cooking operations in these canteens are generally manual labor, which is relatively inefficient. On average, one cook can only prepare meals for 30 to 40 people. However, after realizing kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization and reforming kitchenware, according to the experience of some units (such as the Broadcasting Equipment Factory and the Huangjunying Canteen of the Heping People's Commune), efficiency can be increased by about 100%, with each cook preparing meals for about 70 people on average. In this way, one-third to one-half of the tens of thousands of cooks can be saved to participate in production, which is a considerable force.

Second, it can create favorable conditions for improving canteen work. Now, most of the working people eat in canteens. Continuously improving canteen work is a very important aspect of caring for the lives of the masses. After realizing kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization, cooks can put more energy into increasing the variety of dishes and improving the quality of food. After the Broadcasting Equipment Factory carried out kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization, manpower became more abundant, and a small shop was set up, and the variety of staple foods was also increased, which was very popular among the employees.

Third, kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization can greatly reduce the labor intensity of cooks, allowing them more time to study politics and culture, and participate in recreational activities. Some female cooks said, "Collectivization was a liberation, and mechanization is another liberation." Many cooks enthusiastically participate in technical innovation, write poems and songs, and cheer for kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization, one of the reasons is this.

It can be seen that kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization is a great thing that can not only change the face of cooking labor but also benefit the leap forward in production. The attitude of those who think that kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization is unimportant and therefore are not active in this work is wrong. We should seriously grasp this work and carry it through to the end, striving to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization in some major processes in all canteens, especially larger ones, within a relatively short period of time, and save a batch of manpower.

In order to make the kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization movement quickly achieve practical results, we must seize the following links:

First, in the manufacturing of kitchen machinery, we must rely mainly on self-reliance. There are many canteens in this city, the number of machines required is large, and the demand is urgent. It is impossible to rely on individual factories to solve the problem. It should mainly be manufactured by each unit itself. In order to save time, all units with the ability to manufacture should imitate some effective kitchen machinery and manufacture it themselves, or unite with other units to cooperate and divide the work, you make one kind, I make another kind. Only in this way can the movement quickly blossom and bear fruit. In this regard, there should be no idea of sitting and waiting for reliance.

Second, in the work of manufacturing kitchen machinery and tools, we must implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods: if we can use foreign methods, we will use foreign methods; if we cannot use foreign methods, we will use indigenous methods or semi-indigenous and semi-foreign methods according to our own conditions; we can engage in both machinery and tools. Some methods seem very simple, but the effect is very practical. In the past, the Huangjunying Canteen of the Heping Commune had three young men carrying more than 100 loads of water a day. Now, they have built a "local tap water" made of brick and cement from the well to the kitchen. One person pushes the water cart, and the water flows into the kitchen, saving two and a half laborers. In this work, we must also carry forward the spirit of hard work and painstaking effort, mobilize the masses, and do everything possible to solve the problems of manpower and materials needed to manufacture machinery and tools.

Third, distinguish between priorities and emergencies, and first attack the links that occupy the most labor. In suburban canteens, we must first solve the problems of rice and flour processing, drinking water, and stoves, and vigorously develop electric mills, vertical mills, water pressure wells, local tap water, exhaust stoves, and backdraft stoves, and then gradually solve the problems of kneading dough and cutting vegetables. In factory, mine, and institutional canteens, we must first solve the problems of kneading dough, washing rice, washing dishes, and cutting vegetables, and then solve other problems.

All units with canteens should seriously grasp the work of kitchen mechanization and semi-mechanization. The experience of many units has proved that as long as the leadership attaches importance to it and deeply mobilizes the masses, practical results can be achieved in a short period of time.

### 炊具改革是一件大事  北京日报社论

    炊具改革是一件大事
    北京日报社论
    一个食堂炊事机械化半机械化运动，正在北京各厂矿、工地、人民公社、商店、机关、学校里展开，这是一件好事情，也是一件大事情。
    实现炊事机械化半机械化的好处很多。
    首先，可以解放出大量劳动力，支援生产战线。大跃进以来，随着各项建设事业的大发展和农村人民公社化，在公共食堂吃饭的人越来越多。现在，北京的食堂数以千计，炊事人员数以万计。这些食堂的炊事操作一般是手工劳动，效率比较低，一个炊事员平均只能做三十人到四十人的饭；而实现炊事机械化半机械化和改革炊具以后，根据一些单位（如广播器材厂与和平人民公社黄军营食堂等）的经验，可以提高效率一倍左右，每个炊事员平均做七十人左右的饭。这样，就可以从数万炊事人员大军中，节约出三分之一到二分之一左右的人员来参加生产，这是一支相当可观的力量。
    第二，可以为改进食堂工作创造有利条件。现在，大部分劳动人民都在食堂里吃饭；不断改进食堂工作，是关心群众生活的一项十分重要的内容。在实现炊事机械化半机械化以后，炊事人员就可以把更多的精力放在增加饭菜品种、提高饭菜质量方面。广播器材厂开展炊事机械化半机械化以后，人力有了富裕，又设立了小卖部，主食的花样也增加了，很受职工欢迎。
    第三，炊事机械化半机械化，可以大大减轻炊事人员的劳动强度，使他们有更多的时间学习政治和文化，参加文娱活动。有的女炊事人员说：“集体化是一次解放，机械化是又一次解放。”许多炊事人员兴高采烈地参加技术革新，写诗作歌，欢呼炊事机械化半机械化，原因之一就在此。
    由此可见，炊事机械化半机械化是一件既可以改变炊事劳动面貌、又有利于生产跃进的大好事；那种认为炊事机械化半机械化无关紧要，因而对这个工作不积极的态度是不对的。我们应当认真地把这个工作抓起来，抓到底，力求在一个较短的时期内，使一切食堂尤其是比较大的食堂，在一些主要工序上实现机械化半机械化，节约出一批人力来。
    要使炊事机械化半机械化的运动迅速收到实效，当前要抓紧几个环节：
    第一，在炊事机械的制造上，要以自力更生为主。本市的食堂很多，需要的机械数量大，要求急，要想依靠个别工厂来解决是不可能的，主要应当由各单位自己制造。为了争取时间，一切有能力制造的单位，应当仿照一些行之有效的炊事机械，自行制造，或者同别的单位联合起来，分工合作，你造一种，我造一种，这样，才能够使运动迅速开花结果。在这方面，不能存有坐等依赖的思想。
    第二，在制造炊事机械和工具的工作中，要实行土洋结合的方针：能洋就洋，不能洋就根据本身条件，搞土的，或者半土半洋的；既可以搞机械，也可以搞工具。有一些办法，看起来很简单，但是效果很实在。和平公社黄军营食堂过去一天三个小伙子挑一百多挑水；现在搞了从水井到厨房的砖砌水泥抹的“土自来水”，一个人推水车，水就流到厨房里来，省下了两个半劳动力。在这个工作中，还要发扬穷干苦干的精神，发动群众，千方百计自己解决制造机械、工具所需要的人力、材料等问题。
    第三，分别轻重缓急，首先进攻那些占用劳动力最多的环节。在郊区食堂里，首先要解决米面加工、吃水、锅灶等问题，大搞电磨、立磨、压水机井、土自来水、抽风灶、反风灶等，然后再逐步解决和面、切菜等问题。在厂矿、机关等食堂里，首先要解决和面、淘米、洗碗、切菜等问题，然后再解决其他问题。
    凡是有食堂的单位，都应当把炊事机械化半机械化的工作认真地抓起来。许多单位的经验证明，只要领导重视，深入发动群众，就可以在短期内收到实效。
