Xinhua News Agency, December 9th. The responsible person of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace today issued a statement regarding the Salazar dictatorial regime of Portugal's conspiracy to further persecute the famous Portuguese patriot and peace fighter, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, Álvaro Cunhal.

The responsible person of the Peace Committee said: "The Portuguese Salazar government's recent conspiracy to further persecute the famous Portuguese patriot and peace fighter, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, Álvaro Cunhal, has aroused increasing indignation among the Portuguese people and just public opinion in various countries. As everyone knows, Cunhal is an outstanding son of the Portuguese people, a resolute opponent of fascism, and a prominent fighter who actively struggles for peace and justice. The Salazar government brutally imprisoned him and repeatedly extended his sentence for ten years. Now, it is plotting to extend his sentence again, preventing him from regaining his freedom. This barbaric act of trampling on human rights and democracy is intolerable to all people who uphold justice and love peace throughout the world." The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace strongly protests and condemns the Portuguese authorities' illegal acts of persecuting Cunhal and other patriots and peace fighters, and demands that the Portuguese authorities immediately release Cunhal and other peace fighters. The Chinese people deeply care about and sympathize with the Portuguese people's struggle for peace and democracy and firmly support the Portuguese people's just movement demanding the release of political prisoners. We firmly believe that, with the support of peace-loving and justice-upholding people in all countries, the Portuguese people's unremitting struggle for democracy, freedom, and peace will surely achieve final victory."

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th. The responsible person of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement today, resolutely demanding that the Portuguese Salazar regime immediately release Álvaro Cunhal, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, and other Portuguese patriots who have waged an unyielding struggle to defend the interests of the working class.

The responsible person of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: In order to save its crumbling dictatorial rule, the Portuguese Salazar regime is stepping up the persecution of patriotic people. The Portuguese Communist Party has become the main target of this brutal persecution. Álvaro Cunhal, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, has been imprisoned for ten years, and his sentence has been repeatedly extended. The new sentence will expire in January next year, but the Salazar regime is still attempting to continue imprisoning him. Other comrades of the Portuguese Communist Party and other patriotic people who are imprisoned with him have also reached the end of their sentences, but the Portuguese authorities are not releasing them either. The Chinese working class feels great anger and expresses strong protest against the Salazar regime's blatant persecution and arbitrary trampling of human rights. The Chinese working class firmly supports the Portuguese people's just struggle against dictatorship and resolutely demands the immediate release of Álvaro Cunhal and other Portuguese patriots.

Xinhua News Agency, December 9th. The responsible person of the Secretariat of the China Political Science and Law Society issued a statement today saying, "In order to uphold justice, defend human rights, and safeguard democracy and freedom, Chinese legal workers express firm support for the Portuguese people's movement to demand the release of political prisoners, and call on all honest legal workers around the world, in accordance with the principle of law serving peace and justice, to unite and fight for the restoration of Cunhal's freedom and the rescue of all persecuted patriots in Portugal!"

    中国人民要求立即释放库尼亚尔
    我国和大、全总和政法学会抗议葡当局迫害爱国者
    新华社9日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会负责人今天就葡萄牙萨拉查独裁政权阴谋进一步迫害著名的葡萄牙爱国者与和平战士、葡萄牙共产党中央委员会书记阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔发表了谈话。
    和大负责人说：“葡萄牙萨拉查政府最近阴谋进一步迫害著名葡萄牙爱国者与和平战士、葡萄牙共产党中央委员会书记阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔，激起了葡萄牙人民和各国公正舆论愈来愈大的愤慨。大家知道，库尼亚尔是葡萄牙人民的优秀儿子，是一位坚决反对法西斯、为和平和正义事业而积极斗争的杰出战士。萨拉查政府残暴地把他监禁并再三延长刑期十年之久，现在又阴谋再度延长他的刑期，不让他恢复自由。这种摧残人权和民主的横蛮行为，是全世界一切主持正义和爱好和平的人民所不能容忍的。“中国人民保卫世界和平委员会强烈抗议和谴责葡萄牙当局迫害库尼亚尔和其他爱国者及和平战士的非法行为，要求葡萄牙当局立即释放库尼亚尔和其他和平战士。中国人民对于葡萄牙人民争取和平和民主的斗争寄予深切的关怀和同情，对于葡萄牙人民要求释放政治犯的正义运动表示坚决支持。我们坚信，在各国爱好和平与主持正义的人民的支持下，葡萄牙人民为争取民主、自由和和平而进行的不懈斗争一定会获得最后胜利。”
    据新华社8日讯　中华全国总工会负责人今天发表讲话，坚决要求葡萄牙萨拉查政权立即释放为保卫工人阶级利益而进行了不屈不挠斗争的葡萄牙共产党中央委员会书记阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔和葡萄牙其他爱国志士。
    全总负责人说：葡萄牙萨拉查政权为了挽救其摇摇欲坠的独裁统治，正加紧迫害爱国人民。葡萄牙共产党更成为这种残酷迫害的主要对象。葡萄牙共产党中央委员会书记阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔被捕入狱已有十年之久，他的刑期被一再延长。新的刑期将在明年1月届满，但是萨拉查政权还企图继续对他进行监禁。同他一起被监禁在狱的还有葡萄牙共产党的其他同志和其他爱国志士的刑期也已届满，但是葡萄牙当局也不释放他们。中国工人阶级对萨拉查政权这种明目张胆任意摧残人权的迫害行为感到极大的愤怒，并表示强烈的抗议。中国工人阶级坚决支持葡萄牙人民反独裁的正义斗争，坚决要求立即释放阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔和其他葡萄牙爱国志士。
    据新华社9日讯　中国政治法律学会书记处负责人今天发表谈话说，“为了伸张正义，保卫人权，维护民主和自由，中国法律工作者对葡萄牙人民要求释放政治犯的运动表示坚决的支持，并呼吁全世界正直的法律工作者，本着法律为和平与正义服务的宗旨，共同起来为恢复库尼亚尔的自由，救援葡萄牙一切受迫害的爱国者而进行斗争！”
