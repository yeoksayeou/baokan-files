Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: China's meteorological work has achieved great success this year by adopting the method of combining large, medium, and small scales and integrating indigenous and foreign methods. At present, the country has formed a weather service network of "stations in every district, posts in every county, sentry posts in every commune, and teams in every production team." They have played a huge role in serving production, especially agricultural production, and have become one of the important weapons for the broad masses of people in fighting natural disasters.

Using the method of combining large, medium, and small scales for weather forecasting is an innovation of the Chinese masses in meteorological work. In 1958, the Zhenxiong County Climate Station in Yunnan Province first summarized the experience of supplementary weather forecasting. This forecasting method is based on listening to the weather forecasts of provincial and district meteorological observatories, combined with local terrain and geographical conditions, mass experience, historical meteorological data, and actual observations of celestial and terrestrial phenomena to make supplementary weather forecasts that are in line with local conditions. In the first half of 1959, the Jinbei District Meteorological Observatory in Shanxi Province summarized the experience of drawing small weather maps of the district on the basis of large-scale weather analysis broadcasts from provincial and higher meteorological observatories, combined with local celestial and terrestrial phenomena, terrain, and geographical conditions, to make weather forecasts for the district, divided by county and area. This organically combined the large-scale weather forecasts of provincial and higher meteorological observatories, the regional forecasts of the district meteorological observatories divided by county and area, and the supplementary forecasts of county meteorological stations and people's commune meteorological sentry posts, and developed into a complete method of combining large, medium, and small scales for weather forecasting. The biggest feature of this forecast is that it is tailored to local conditions, time, and specific needs, the forecast content is specific and timely, it is closely integrated with production needs, it includes the laws of large-scale weather changes, and it takes into account the characteristics of local weather changes, it has both modern meteorological science and technology, and the rich experience of the masses. This is a concrete application of the "walking on two legs" of integrating indigenous and foreign methods and the mass line method in meteorological science.

Facts have proved that the accuracy of weather forecasts has been greatly improved after the method of combining large, medium, and small scales for weather forecasting has been promoted. According to incomplete statistics, from the second half of 1958 to the present, the average accuracy rate of national weather forecasts has increased by more than 10% compared with 1957. Taking the Jinbei District Meteorological Observatory in Shanxi Province as an example, the accuracy rate of precipitation forecasts, which were difficult to report accurately in the past, increased by 16.9% from May to July this year compared with the same period last year.

The rapid establishment of the weather service network and its penetration into rural areas, and the continuous improvement of the accuracy of weather forecasts, have made meteorological work achieve significant results in serving agricultural production. After July this year, a severe drought occurred in the Central China region, the worst in decades. Meteorological observatories (stations) and meteorological sentry posts (teams) at all levels in Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and other provinces actively participated in the drought resistance struggle under the unified leadership of local Party and government authorities. The meteorological observatories, stations, and sentry posts (teams) in Henan Province reported soil moisture, dry soil layer temperature, rainfall, crop growth, and other conditions to the leading organs at all levels every two or three days, and made a forecast that Henan would continue to be dry in August and September, which played a role as a consultant and assistant for the leading organs at all levels in directing the drought resistance struggle. The Nanjing Meteorological Observatory in Jiangsu Province issued a long-term forecast in June this year that a drought would occur in Jiangsu Province in July and August. The Jiangsu Provincial Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters immediately took measures, not only did not lower the water level of Hongze Lake before the flood season as usual, but also blocked the old Jiang Dam, intercepting 3 billion cubic meters of irrigation water, ensuring the bumper harvest of 13 million mu of rice.

Certain achievements have also been made this year in various professional forecasting services. In terms of agricultural meteorological forecasting, more than half of the meteorological observatories and stations in the country have carried out prediction and forecasting of the sowing period, flowering period, harvesting period, and pests and diseases of local major crops, with significant service effects. During the spring sowing period this year, the Suzhou District Meteorological Observatory in Jiangsu Province made a timely forecast of the early rice sowing period, which enabled the entire district to sow early rice ten days in advance, achieving early transplanting and avoiding cold waves, thus avoiding seedling rot. The meteorological departments in Hebei Province cooperated with the agricultural departments to timely release locust forecasts, and the Party committee timely organized the masses to prevent and control locusts, so that the locusts in 114,000 mu of locust-infested areas were eliminated before the third instar.

　　大中小结合和土洋并举的花果
    全国组成气象服务网
    天气预报准确率提高　为农业生产立下大功
    新华社29日讯　我国气象事业采取大中小和土洋结合的办法，一年来获得了巨大成绩。现在，全国已经组成“专区有台、县县有站、社社有哨、队队有组”的气象服务网，它们在为生产服务、特别为农业生产服务方面起了巨大作用，已经成为广大人民群众向自然灾害作斗争的重要武器之一。
    用大中小相结合的方法作天气预报，是我国群众在气象工作中的创举。1958年云南省镇雄县气候站第一次总结出了补充天气预报的经验。这种预报方法，是在收听省和专区气象台天气预报的基础上，结合当地地形地理条件、群众经验、气象历史资料和天象物象等实况观测，做出切合当地情况的补充天气预报。1959年上半年，山西省晋北专区气象台总结出了在省以上气象台大型天气分析广播的基础上，填绘本专区的小天气图，结合当地天象、物象、地形地理等条件，作出本区分县分片的天气预报，这样就把省以上气象台大范围的天气预报、专区气象台区域性分县分片的预报同县气象站和人民公社气象哨的补充预报有机地结合起来，发展成为一套完整的天气预报大、中、小相结合的方法。这种预报的最大特点是：因地、因时、因事制宜，预报内容具体及时，密切结合生产需要，既包括了大范围天气变化的规律，又考虑到地方性天气变化特点，既有近代气象科学技术，又有群众的丰富经验。这是土洋并举“两条腿走路”和群众路线方法在气象科学上的具体运用。
    事实证明：天气预报大、中、小相结合的方法推广之后，准确率有了很大提高。据不完全的统计，从1958年下半年到现在，全国天气预报的准确率平均比1957年提高10％以上。以山西晋北专区气象台为例，过去难以报准确的降水预报，今年5月至7月比去年同期准确率提高16.9％。
    气象服务网的迅速建立和深入农村，天气预报准确率的不断提高，使气象工作为农业生产服务收到显著效果。今年7月以后，华中地区发生了数十年来没有过的大旱灾。湖北、湖南、河南等省的各级气象台（站）和广大气象哨（组），在当地党政统一领导下，积极参加了抗旱斗争。河南全省的气象台站哨（组），每隔两三天向各级领导机关报告土壤湿度、干土层温度、降雨量、作物生长等情况，并且做出8、9两月份河南继续干旱的预报，对各级领导机关指挥抗旱斗争起了参谋和助手的作用。江苏省南京气象台在今年6月份就发布了7、8月份江苏省将出现旱情的长期预报，江苏省防汛抗旱总指挥部随即采取措施，不但没有按照常年的规矩在汛期未来前预降洪泽湖水位，而且把旧江坝堵闭起来，多拦蓄三十亿立方米的灌溉用水，保证了一万三千万亩水稻的丰收。
    在各种专业预报服务方面，今年也获得了一定成绩。在农业气象预报方面，全国有半数以上的气象台站开展了当地主要农作物播种期、扬花期、收获期和病虫害的预测预报，服务效果显著。江苏省苏州专区气象台，在今年春播期间，由于及时做出早稻播种期预报，使全专区早稻提前播种十天，做到了早插、早栽，躲过了寒流，避免了烂秧。河北省气象部门配合农业部门及时发布蝗虫预报，党委及时组织群众防治，使十一万四千亩蝗区的蝗虫消灭在三龄之前。
