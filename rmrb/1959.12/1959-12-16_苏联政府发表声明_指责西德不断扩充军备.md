Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th: TASS reports: The Soviet government recently issued a statement regarding the West German government's continuous expansion of armaments by utilizing its status as a member of the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This statement was delivered by the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to West Germany, Timoshchenko, to the West German Foreign Ministry on the 14th.

The statement points out that the West German government is taking all possible measures to gradually eliminate the few restrictions imposed on it by the Paris Agreements. These actions are in no way consistent with the West German government's statements that it favors comprehensive disarmament.

The statement points out that the West German government should be mindful of the responsibility it bears to its own people and the people of other countries for attempting to accelerate the arms race and obstructing the elimination of the remnants of German militarism, which caused the last world war.

The statement concludes that the West German government's policy does not inspire confidence that the West German government genuinely hopes for a peaceful resolution of post-war issues at the upcoming summit meeting. Otherwise, it would abandon all measures that hinder reaching an agreement.

The Soviet Ambassadors to the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands, as well as the Minister to Luxembourg, also delivered corresponding statements to the governments of these countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn: West German Defense Minister Strauss recently stated at a gathering in Frankfurt am Main that in the future, West Germany will change its past practice of relying as much as possible on "friendly countries" in certain aspects of arms production, such as the aircraft manufacturing industry.

These words indicate that West German monopoly capitalists are unwilling to allow foreign arms dealers to take the huge profits of rearmament and want to put as much as possible into their own pockets.

According to Strauss, so far, 60% of the orders for the West German "Bundeswehr" have been given to domestic enterprises and 40% to foreign countries. In terms of heavy equipment, orders given to domestic and foreign countries each account for half.

Not long ago, the Western European Union had already announced that it would allow West Germany to produce certain missile weapons. With American support, the Bonn government has also formally requested the Western European Union to approve the lifting of restrictions on the tonnage of West German warships. West Germany is building eight 4,000-ton destroyers equipped with missiles and radar equipment.

Strauss also said that certain military orders will certainly promote West Germany's "space flight research."

Strauss indicated that military budgets for the next few years would exceed 10 billion marks annually. He said that in the 1959-60 budget year, the Ministry of Defense would spend 8.3 to 8.4 billion marks.

    苏联政府发表声明
    指责西德不断扩充军备
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府最近就西德政府利用它是西欧联盟和北大西洋公约组织成员国的身分不断扩充军备一事发表了一项声明。这项声明已由苏联驻西德大使馆临时代办铁木辛哥在14日递交给西德外交部。
    声明指出，西德政府正在采取一切手段来逐条取消巴黎协定对它所规定的那些不多的限制。这些行动无论如何也不符合西德政府所发表的关于它赞成全面裁军的声明。
    声明指出，西德政府应该留心由于它力图加速进行军备竞赛和阻挠消除德国军国主义所制造的上次大战的残余而对本国人民和其他国家人民所应负的责任。
    声明最后指出，西德政府的政策无法使人相信，西德政府在实际行动中真的希望在即将召开的高级会议上使战后的问题得到和平解决。否则，它就会放弃一切妨碍达成协议的措施。
    苏联驻英国、法国、意大利、比利时和荷兰大使以及驻卢森堡公使也向这些国家的政府递交了相应的声明。
    据新华社波恩电　西德国防部长施特劳斯最近在美因河畔法兰克福的一次集会上说，今后西德在军火生产的某些方面，例如在飞机制造工业方面，将改变过去尽量依靠“友好国家”的作法。
    这些话表明，西德垄断资本家不甘心把重新武装的巨大利润让给外国军火商，而要尽量多地放入他们自己的腰包。
    据施特劳斯说，到目前为止西德“国防军”的订货有60％交给了国内的企业，40％交给国外。在重型器材方面，交给国内和国外的订货各占一半。
    不久以前西欧联盟已经宣布允许西德生产某些导弹武器。波恩政府在美国支持下还正式请求西欧联盟批准取消西德军舰吨数的限制。西德正在建造八艘四千吨的装有导弹和雷达设备的驱逐舰。
    施特劳斯还说，通过某些军事定货一定能够促进西德的“宇宙空间飞行研究”。
    施特劳斯表示，今后几年的军事预算每年要超过一百亿马克。他说，在1959—60预算年度中国防部将支出八十三到八十四亿马克。
