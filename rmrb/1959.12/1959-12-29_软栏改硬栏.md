Editorial Note:

　　While various localities are vigorously building pig farms near fields for raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, paying attention to renovating existing livestock pens is also a good way to accumulate more manure and an important measure to promote the rapid development of livestock. Many facts prove that hard pigsties have four advantages: First, they accumulate more fertilizer. Due to the reduction of manure loss, hard pigsties generally accumulate more than twice as much fertilizer as soft pigsties. Second, the quality of the fertilizer is better. Hard pigsties prevent pig manure and urine from seeping into the soil, and rainwater will not flow in during rainy days, thus significantly improving the quality of manure. Third, the grass pads in soft pigsties are mixed with manure, which is prone to dampness and breeding of germs, while hard pigsties are easy to clean and flush, keeping the pens clean and hygienic, reducing diseases, and improving the survival rate of piglets and promoting fattening. Fourth, hard pigsties do not require grass pads in summer, and very little padding is needed in winter, saving a large amount of dry grass compared to soft pigsties. In addition, hard pigsties allow manure and urine to flow into the fertilizer pit, which also saves a lot of labor in carrying fertilizer.

　　It is thus clear that paying attention to renovating old pigsties is an important basic construction project for agricultural and animal husbandry production.

　　软栏改硬栏
    在各地大建田头猪场就近养猪积肥的时候，注意改建原有的家畜栏圈，也是多积厩肥的一个好办法，同时又是促进家畜迅速发展的一项重要措施。许多事实证明，硬栏有四个好处：首先是积肥多，由于减少了屎便流失，硬栏积肥一般要比软栏增加一倍以上。其次是肥质好，硬栏不会使猪粪尿渗透入土，雨天也不会流入雨水，因此厩肥质量显著提高；第三，软栏垫的草和厩肥混在一起，容易潮湿和滋生病菌，而硬栏便于打扫、冲洗，保持栏圈清洁卫生，减少疫病，提高仔猪的成活率和促进长膘；第四，硬栏夏天不要垫草，冬天也垫得很少，比软栏可节省大量干草。此外，硬栏由于粪尿可流入肥坑，也节省了很多挑肥的劳力。
    由此可见，注意改建旧栏，是农业和畜牧业生产上一项重要的基本建设。
