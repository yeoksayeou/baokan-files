Annotation of "Twenty-Seven Character Order"
Gong Tongwen

In ci poetry, there is "Sixteen Character Order." Comrade Mao Zedong wrote three "Sixteen Character Order" poems, and the line "Overturning the seas and rivers, rolling up huge waves" is soul-stirring. Recently, members of the Bailizhou People's Commune in Yidu County created a "Twenty-Seven Character Order" (this is the name we gave it), which also contains soul-stirring lines. The full text is as follows:

	"Individual farming resists drought,
		Weeping and wailing;
	Agricultural cooperative resists drought,
		Waterwheels irrigate;
	People's commune resists drought,
		Overturning rivers and seas."

In just twenty-seven characters, there is a great deal to be said. Let's try to annotate it as follows:

Drought is when the sky does not rain, and crops are dry and thirsty, desperately needing water. In the era of our ancestors, "if it does not rain for five days, there will be no wheat... if it does not rain for ten days, there will be no grain, and without wheat and grain, the year will be one of famine" (Su Shi: "Record of the Joyful Rain Pavilion"). "Hoping for clouds and rainbows in a great drought" shows that our ancestors relied on the heavens for food. Even now, some people still follow the old ways. One is the fault of "fatalism"; the other is "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." How heavy is a waterwheel? How much labor does it take to dig a canal? How many hours can a person keep watering in the hot sun?... And so on, for individual farmers, besides "weeping and wailing," they have to "rely on the heavens for food."

Agricultural collectivization has allowed us to cross the era of "weeping and wailing" in the face of natural disasters. We once brought into play the superiority of being organized, built agricultural water conservancy projects, and made it easy to use waterwheels for irrigation. At that time, the strength of most of the agricultural production cooperatives in Xishui County could withstand "fifty days without rain." Compared with the old days of "five days without rain, there will be no wheat" and "ten days without rain, there will be no grain," this is truly one in heaven and one on earth.

Is it that the heavens are deliberately making trouble? When the people's commune was less than one year old, when grain, cotton, oil and other crops most needed water, it just didn't rain, for a hundred days, some places one hundred and thirty or forty days, without a drop of rain. This was a drought unseen in seventy-two years. In the face of such a major drought, "weeping and wailing" is of course absurd, and even "waterwheel irrigation" is useless because the ponds and weirs are dry and there is no water to draw. What to do? "Overturning rivers and seas!" Hubei Province has no "sea" to "overturn," only rivers and lakes to overturn, diverting water uphill, diverting water up mountains, self-flowing irrigation, water pumps and waterwheels, all at once! In this way, we protected the early rice, then the middle rice, and rescued the late rice, snatching huge wealth back from the drought demon.

In just twenty-seven characters, a history of drought resistance is written. Taking drought resistance as the theme, it praises the power of the people's commune with its large size and high degree of public ownership, and makes a clear comparison between the people's commune and the agricultural cooperative, and between the agricultural cooperative and individual farming, describing the path of agricultural production development in our country, and expressing the farmers' love for the people's commune.

These twenty-seven characters can only be said by someone who was once an individual farmer, then a member of an agricultural cooperative, and now a member of a people's commune. Only those who have personally walked the road from individual farming to mutual aid groups, to cooperatives, to people's communes can appreciate the taste. What kind of taste is this? It is "eating sugarcane from the top, the more you eat, the sweeter it gets!" Who can feel the superiority of the people's commune more keenly than the members who love the people's commune?

We are very surprised that some people, who have neither personally experienced the benefits of the people's commune nor conducted serious investigations and research on the people's commune, close their eyes and talk nonsense: "The people's commune was established too early and has been ruined," "The people's commune is not as good as the agricultural cooperative, the agricultural cooperative is not as good as the mutual aid group, and the mutual aid group is not as good as individual farming!" We should advise these people to live in the people's commune for a while, eat, live, and work with the members, talk to the poor and lower-middle peasants, listen to their recollections and comparisons, and look at the "Ten-Year Exhibition" they hold. Then, think about it calmly, and maybe they will become more human.

The people's commune movement is a great revolutionary movement consciously and voluntarily undertaken by more than 500 million farmers. The people's commune has only been established for one year and has already made many meritorious contributions. Resisting the largest drought in seventy-two years is just one of them.

Now, the people's commune is changing the face of agricultural production with the power of "overturning rivers and seas." Take a look at how the people's communes in Yun County and Zaoyang County are comprehensively managing water, mountains, and soil, with water management as the center, turning poor mountains into rich mountains, and transforming hills into plains! Take a look at how the people's communes throughout the province are vigorously engaging in basic construction and technological innovation! The brilliance of the General Line, the experience of the Great Leap Forward, and the superiority of the People's Commune give us unlimited strength. We will not only overturn rivers and seas, but also turn the world upside down.

If someone wants to ask, how great is the superiority of the people's commune? There is no such degree, measure, or weight in the world. If there is, it is time. Only a little over a year has passed, and the superiority of the people's commune is only beginning to show. After this severe drought resistance struggle, especially following the drought resistance struggle, a high tide of large-scale basic construction and technological innovation was launched. People are increasingly feeling the light and warmth of this rising sun. Time is ruthless. Time moves forward according to its own laws, and the superiority of the people's commune will increase with time. It is not time that is lagging behind, nor is it the superiority of the people's commune, but people's understanding. People will improve their understanding of the superiority of the people's commune as practice becomes richer. For example: without this year's drought resistance struggle and a series of production struggle practices, the people of Bailizhou would not have created this "Twenty-Seven Character Order," that is to say, they would not have realized that the people's commune can "overturn rivers and seas."

"Heaven is the chessboard, stars are the pieces." Let us borrow Comrade Mao Zedong's "Three Sixteen-Character Orders" to describe the development of our people's commune.

	"Mountain!
	The fast horse urges its whip without dismounting.
	Startled, looking back,
	Three feet three from the sky."

This is the high speed of production development in the people's commune. The members of the Yunyang Daye Commune Construction Management Area have a poem like this:

	"Terraced fields rise layer upon layer,
	Only nine feet nine from the sky,
	Half of it extends into the clouds,
	White rice will be harvested in the sky."

If our achievements are now "nine feet nine from the sky," in the near future, it will be "three feet three from the sky." Speaking of this, please pay attention to right-leaning opportunists, "nine feet nine" and "three feet three" are figurative expressions, just like the relationship between achievements and shortcomings is nine fingers and one finger. Don't think this is "exaggeration" again! Soviet artificial satellites, space rockets, and automatic interplanetary stations have opened up a new era for mankind to conquer the universe. Even cowards who are afraid of falling to their deaths going upstairs! "How can you see the sky with a basin on your head?"

	"Mountain!
	Overturning the seas and rivers, rolling up huge waves.
	Galloping rapidly,
	Ten thousand horses are still fighting fiercely."

This is the momentum of the large-scale mass movement of the people's commune. "One horse takes the lead, ten thousand horses gallop," "Whipping the fast horse," advancing a thousand miles a day. The people's communes throughout the province have organized an army of 3.6 million (as of November 20th - Editor's note) to go to the water conservancy construction site, and at this moment they are "still fighting fiercely!"

	"Mountain!
	The edge that pierces the blue sky has not been blunted.
	The sky is about to fall,
	Relying on it to prop it up."

This is the strong vitality of the people's commune. The People's Commune is the cornerstone of the socialist system. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "With the social organization of the People's Commune, we have in fact found a way to gradually transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist public ownership in our country under our conditions, and even to gradually transition from socialism to communism in the countryside in the future." At that time, it will be as Comrade Mao Zedong predicted:

	"If the goddess is still well,
	She should be surprised that the world has changed greatly."
		(Water Melody Song "Swimming")

	"A peaceful world,
	The globe shares the same coolness and warmth."
		(Thinking of You at Niannu "Kunlun")

### “二十七字令”注解

    “二十七字令”注解
    龚同文
    在词牌里，有“十六字令”。毛泽东同志写过“十六字令”三首，“倒海翻江卷巨澜”之句，动人心魄。宜都县百里洲人民公社的社员最近创作了一首“二十七字令”（这是我们给它取了这个名儿），其中也有动人心魄之句。全文曰：
    “单干抗旱，
    哭哭哀哀；
    合作社抗旱，
    车水灌溉；
    人民公社抗旱，
    翻江倒海。”
    寥寥二十七字，大有文章。试作注解如下：
    旱，就是天不下雨，庄稼干渴生烟，非喝不可。在我们的老祖宗的时代，“五日不雨则无麦，……十日不雨则无禾，无麦无禾，岁且荐饥”（苏轼：“喜雨亭记”）。“大旱望云霓”，说明老祖宗靠天吃饭。直到现在，还有人照老祖宗的规矩办事。一是“宿命论”作怪；二是“心有余而力不足”。一乘水车有多重？挖一条渠要费多少工？大热天一个人车水能顶住几个钟头？……如此等等，对于单干农民来说，除了“哭哭哀哀”之外，只好“靠天吃饭”。
    农业合作化，使我们跨过了在天灾面前“哭哭哀哀”的时代，我们曾经发挥了组织起来的优越性，兴修了农田水利，便于车水灌溉。当时浠水县的绝大部分农业生产合作社的力量，可以经得起“五十日不雨”。这和“五日不雨则无麦”、“十日不雨则无禾”的旧时代相比，真是一个在天上，一个在地下。
    是老天爷故意捣乱吧。在人民公社还不到一周岁的时候，在粮、棉、油等农作物最需要水的时候，偏不下雨，一直百把天，有的地方一百三四十天，不下透雨，这是七十二年来没有的旱灾。在这样大的旱灾面前，“哭哭哀哀”当然不像话，就是“车水灌溉”，因为塘堰干涸，也无水可车了。怎么办呢？“翻江倒海”！湖北省无“海”可“倒”，只有翻江，翻湖，引水上坡，引水上山，自流灌溉，抽水机、水车，一齐上！就这样，保住了早稻，又保中稻，救晚稻，从旱魔手里夺回了巨大的财富。
    寥寥二十七字，写出了一部抗旱史。以抗旱为主题，歌颂了人民公社一大二公的威力，并且把人民公社和农业社，把农业社和单干，作了鲜明的对比，描述了我国农业生产发展的道路，表述了农民对于人民公社的热爱。
    这二十七个字，只有曾经是单干农民，后来是农业社社员，现在是人民公社的社员才说得出来。从单干，到互助组，到合作社，到人民公社这一段路，只有亲自走过的人，才能领略此中滋味。这是什么滋味？是“从梢上吃甘蔗，越吃越甜”！还有谁比热爱人民公社的社员更亲切的感受到人民公社的优越性呢？
    我们很奇怪，有些人既没亲身体验过人民公社的好处，又没有对人民公社作过认真的调查研究，却闭着眼睛发胡说：“人民公社办早了，办糟了”，“人民公社不如农业社，农业社不如互助组，互助组不如单干”！应当奉劝这些人到人民公社住些日子，跟着社员们同吃、同住、同劳动，同贫农、下中农谈谈心，听听他们回忆对比，看看他们举办的“十年展览”，然后，冷静地想一想，也许会变得通人性一些。
    人民公社化运动是五亿多农民自觉自愿的伟大的革命运动。人民公社建立才一年，就立下了许多汗马功劳，抗住了七十二年来没有的大旱，只不过是其中的一件功劳而已。
    现在，人民公社正在以“翻江倒海”的力量，改变农业生产面貌。看一看郧县和枣阳县的人民公社是怎样以治水为中心全面的治水、治山、治土，变穷山为富山，要岗地赶平原吧！看一看全省的人民公社是怎样大搞基本建设和技术革新吧！总路线的光辉，大跃进的经验，人民公社的优越性，给我们以无限的力量，我们不仅要翻江倒海，而且要翻天覆地。
    如果有人要问，人民公社的优越性到底有多大？全世界没有这样的度、量、衡。如果有的话，那就是时间。时间才过了一年多，人民公社的优越性还只是开始显露出来。经过这一场严重的抗旱斗争，特别是紧接着抗旱斗争之后，掀起了大搞基本建设、大闹技术革新的高潮，人们越来越亲切的感受到这个初升太阳的光明和温暖。时间是无情的。时间按照自己的规律前进，人民公社的优越性将与时俱增。落后的不是时间，也不是人民公社的优越性，而是人们的认识。人们将随着实践的丰富，而提高自己对于人民公社优越性的认识。比如说：不经过今年的抗旱斗争和一系列生产斗争的实践，百里洲的人们创造不出这“二十七字令”，也就是说，认识不到人民公社能够“翻江倒海”。
    “天作棋盘星作子”。借用毛泽东同志的“十六字令三首”来描述我们人民公社的发展吧。
    “山！
    快马加鞭未下鞍。
    惊回首，
    离天三尺三。”
    这是人民公社发展生产的高速度，郧阳大堰公社建设管理区的社员们有一首这样的诗：
    “层层梯田起高楼，
    离天只有九尺九，
    半截伸在云霄里，
    白米要到天上收。”
    如果说，现在我们的成就是“离天九尺九”，在不久的将来，就是“离天三尺三”了。说到这里，请右倾机会主义分子注意，“九尺九”、“三尺三”，是一种形象的说法，像成绩和缺点的关系是九个指头和一个指头的说法一样，你可别以为这又是“浮夸”呀！苏联人造地球卫星、宇宙火箭、自动行星际站，为人类征服宇宙开辟了新纪元。连上楼也怕摔死的胆小鬼！“戴盆何以望天”？
    “山！
    倒海翻江卷巨澜。
    奔腾急，
    万马战犹酣。”
    这是人民公社的大规模的群众运动的声势。“一马当先，万马奔腾”，“快马加鞭”，一日千里。全省的人民公社，已经组织了三百六十万大军（截至11月20日止——本报编者注）开赴水利建设工地，此刻正是“战犹酣”啊！
    “山！
    刺破青天锷未残。
    天欲堕，
    赖以拄其间。”
    这是人民公社强大的生命力。人民公社是社会主义制度的擎天柱石。正像刘少奇同志所说的：“有了人民公社这种社会组织以后，我们在实际上找到了在我国条件下从社会主义集体所有制逐步过渡到社会主义全民所有制，以至将来在农村中由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的道路。”到那时候，将会像毛泽东同志所预言的：
    “神女应无恙，
    当惊世界殊。”
          （水调歌头“游泳”）
    “太平世界，
    环球同此凉热。”
            （念奴娇“昆仑”）
      （原载“七一”杂志）
