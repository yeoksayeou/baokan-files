　　New Fertilizer Source: Lignin

    The Plant Science Institute of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce has proven through experiments that lignin can not only replace chemical fertilizers, but also has better effects than chemical fertilizers. They planted white radishes on two field ridges, using equal amounts of lignin and ammonium sulfate as fertilizers respectively. The results showed that the white radishes fertilized with lignin emerged earlier, with robust and lush branches and leaves. The average weight of the white radishes was 4.2 catties, while the average weight of the white radishes fertilized with ammonium sulfate was 1.18 catties.

    Lignin is a high-molecular-weight hydrocarbon compound in plants, present in both herbaceous and woody plants, and in high content. Therefore, utilizing lignin as fertilizer is a new direction for developing fertilizer sources.

　　新肥源  木质素
    山西省商业厅植物科学研究所试验证明：木质素不仅可以代替化肥，而且效果比化肥高。他们在两块田埂上试种白萝卜，用等量的木质素与硫酸铵分别作肥料，结果用木质素作肥料的白萝卜比用硫酸铵的早出土，枝叶壮肥茂盛，白萝卜平均重四点二斤，而用硫酸铵作肥料的白萝卜平均体重一点一八斤。
    木质素是植物体内一种高分子碳氢氧化合物，草本和木本植物都有，而且含量很高。因此，利用木质素作肥料，是发展肥源的一个新方向。
