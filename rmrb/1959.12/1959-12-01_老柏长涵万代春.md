    Old Cypress Embraces Ten Thousand Generations of Spring
    By Our Correspondent Yu Zhiheng
    In life's long journey, every elderly person has their own unique experiences and encounters. However, the elderly living in New China share a common aspiration: to dedicate their twilight years to the magnificent cause of socialism and communism.
    I interviewed some of these admirable elderly individuals, most of whom had lived through the changes of four dynasties. Dark years like nightmares took away their youth and added streaks of frost to their hair. Yet, today, when you live alongside them, you cannot help but feel a genuine youthful vitality.
    These elderly people, seasoned by life's hardships and vicissitudes, are more profoundly aware of the preciousness of New China than young people who have grown up in cradles of happiness. This is why these elderly people have hearts that burn like those of young people, striving tirelessly day after day to add another brick to the socialist edifice!
    A Veteran of the Xinhai Revolution
    In Beijing, one can often see an elderly lady with snow-white temples attending meetings in a handcart. She inspires a sense of tenacity and vibrant spirit—she is none other than the eighty-two-year-old revolutionary, He Xiangning.
    Not long ago, when reporters visited this elderly woman, she spoke with such excitement and passion about the glorious achievements of New China and the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. She said: "Today's China has not only completed the unfinished tasks of Mr. Sun Yat-sen but has also greatly surpassed his ideals. The Chinese people are no longer called 'the sick men of East Asia.' It is so incredibly honourable to be a citizen of New China!" She repeatedly exclaimed: "New China has a boundless future and limitless beauty. How can elderly people living in this era not work even harder?"
    The elderly woman's enthusiastic words cannot help but bring to mind a past event: In the spring of 1957, when the right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack on the Party and the people, this revolutionary veteran was ill and unable to attend meetings. However, she wrote a written statement and articles such as "The Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Needs Rectification," refuting the absurd arguments of the right-wing elements, despite being ill. At that time, she stood like a huge rock in the torrent, defending the truth, the people, and the cause of socialism. She was so supportive and loving of the Communist Party of China, saying: "Only the Communist Party of China can lead China into socialism and transform the broken, backward old China into a prosperous, strong, and advanced New China!"
    Although He Xiangning is so old, she is full of enthusiasm and works very diligently. In her more than nine years as Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, she has handled an average of more than 1,600 letters from overseas Chinese and domestic relatives of overseas Chinese every year, ensuring that "every case is resolved and every matter is explained." Whenever overseas Chinese came from afar, she would meet with them even when she was ill. She has consistently educated the relatives of overseas Chinese to participate in labor production. Inspired by the great leap forward last year, this elderly woman, whose mobility is limited, also went to inspect silk factories and people's communes in Guangdong at the end of the year.
    In many famous paintings, one can see a famous painting filled with a peaceful atmosphere of a hundred flowers in full bloom and pairs of doves playing in the flowers, entitled "Ode to Peace." This painting is the work of He Xiangning and fourteen other famous Chinese painters, including Qi Baishi, and was presented to the World Peace Congress. Now, the elderly woman continues to paint, saying: "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I painted mostly for charity sales, to rescue wounded soldiers and relieve refugees. Now, when I see the leaping progress of the motherland, I can't help but paint a few strokes. In this wonderful realm, I feel particularly comfortable!"
    An Old Educator with Disciples All Over the World
    In a quiet courtyard, an elderly man with graying hair is sitting by the window, intently sorting through the "Comprehensive Mirror for Governance" and the Old History of the Five Dynasties with a magnifying glass in his hand. He is the old educator Chen Yuan, who has been engaged in education for sixty years.
    Over the decades, countless young people have grown up around him. Some of these young people have just become teachers, some have already taken on leadership roles, some have made great achievements in scientific research, and some, like himself, have become old professors with "disciples all over the world."
    What force has enabled him to persist in the education field for so many years? Before liberation, facing the dark and reactionary rule, Comrade Chen Yuan once harbored deep sorrow and indignation, placing his personal ideals in the education work of cultivating talents for a hundred years, and placing the hope of the motherland in the young generation. However, only after the founding of New China, when he saw that the motherland urgently needed talents everywhere, and that batches of graduates were rushing to the construction posts of the motherland, did he feel for the first time that his ideals and the needs of the motherland were completely integrated, and that he was filled with new strength!
    This elderly man, who once passed the imperial examination in the late Qing Dynasty, is still eager to learn despite being eighty years old. For decades, he has gotten up at four o'clock every morning. When people are still asleep, the lights in his study are already on. He reads from four o'clock to seven o'clock, truly reading through tens of thousands of books. If you were to look at his collection of tens of thousands of books, you could see the imprint of his thoughts on almost every one—marginal notes, annotations, circles, and dots. He has also written many works on history. When he was writing "Corrections and Supplements to Yuan Dian Zhang" and "Explanations of Textual Criticism," the collection of various editions alone took more than twenty years. To write "Chinese-Western Muslim History Calendar" and "Twenty Historical Tables of Leap Months," it took more than three years to write this calendar spanning two thousand years, which is two very valuable works for historical research.
    Everyone who knew him in the past said, "Today's Mr. Chen Yuan is different from the past!" Yes, he has changed, becoming a red elder. Who gave him such a huge change? In Comrade Chen Yuan's own words: "It was the Party that gave me a new life." In the past few decades, he saw the extreme corruption of the ruling class, so he had always been indifferent to politics. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he only went from his home to the school gate, quietly spending eight years in one alley. After liberation, the Communist Party led the people of the whole country to carry out unprecedented construction, which made him truly feel the light and happiness of today. His understanding, admiration, support, and love for the Communist Party grew from not knowing to knowing, from not understanding to admiring, supporting, and loving. From then on, he was determined to dedicate himself to the great cause of the Party and the people!
    On the table in the old man's "Li Yun Study," I found a small piece of paper with the words: "Strive to be a red elder." This was a beautiful wish written by Comrade Chen Yuan during the rectification movement in 1958. The upright strokes of the ink pen contain such exuberant vitality and grand aspirations!
    A Pioneer Exploring the Secrets of the Animal World
    As far back as thirty-nine years ago, when our country did not yet have the science of zoology, it was only when Mr. Bing Zhi taught at Southeast University in Nanjing that he sowed the first seed for zoology in our country.
    It is this seventy-year-old scientist who said that he only truly began systematic scientific research work in the ten years after liberation. In his own words, many scientists were not respected before liberation. Not only did they not have the conditions to conduct scientific research, but sometimes even the basic living conditions were difficult to guarantee. Even if they ran around trying to do some research, it was like "hungry horses rushing to the trough," eating anything without discrimination. Now? The dark rule that weighed on scientists is gone forever, New China has stood up, and the cause of science is also advancing by leaps and bounds. It can be said that in no era have Chinese scientists been able to fully exert their talents and wisdom as they can today.
    "Time waits for no one, opportunity must not be missed." For ten years, Mr. Bing Zhi has felt as if a huge heat is driving him, making him tirelessly explore the secrets of the animal world in the laboratory every day. Like a close friend, he is not only familiar with the appearance and form of various animals, but also understands their internal organs, cells, and even their preferences. He has only one aspiration: to further explore the evolution of the highest animal—man—through the study of the evolution of the animal world, especially the evolution of morality.
    This elderly man is currently studying the morphology of carp. From 1953 to the present, tens of thousands of carp have spent seven years with the elderly man in the laboratory. The crystallization of seven years of hard work is the "Anatomy of Carp" recently completed by the elderly man. This book is the basic theory of zoology, and it is a valuable reference for the work of the aquatic products department in studying carp. This is the first part of his fifteen-year plan. Now he is studying the second part: "Histology of Carp," and the third part: "Embryology of Carp." Mr. Bing is already over seventy years old. How precious are the twilight years of life! He is determined to create more achievements.
    Mr. Bing's passionate enthusiasm for scientific work is touching. He has a disease of hay fever, which recurs every year. Even when he is sick, he refuses to leave the laboratory. No matter how many times he fails, he never gives up. He often uses "three hearts, three fears" to educate his young assistants. The three hearts are: determination, confidence, perseverance. The three fears are: fear of trouble, fear of difficulty, fear of failure. He often says to young people: "Now you young people are too happy, growing up in this new era, with such a good environment and such good conditions. Compared with our years of chaos, when we turned the laboratory into a stable, it is tens of millions of times better. You must not fail the expectations of the Party and the people for you!"
    This old scientist, who passed the imperial examination in the Qing Dynasty, enthusiastically said, I am already over seventy, but my scientific career is just beginning! A poem he recently wrote further expresses his strong will:
      A hundred years of national progress has been plagued by suffering, and suddenly I see the heavens turn and the sun and moon are new.
      The frost on my head in the mirror increases my sigh, and the worm-eaten bamboo slips in front of the lamp hold my spirit.
      The thunder will surely rise from the dormant state of the three winter insects, and the old cypress will always embrace the spring of ten thousand generations.
      I am still working hard all my life, and I will see myself fly out of the dust with vigour.
    An Old Doctor Worried About the People's Health
    Today, how many old Chinese medicine practitioners are inheriting the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and working hard for the health of the people? Just when the epidemic of measles and post-measles pneumonia was prevalent in Beijing last year, and the lives of many children were threatened by death, an elderly man with graying temples and a silver beard hanging down his chest used his decades of rich clinical experience in "epidemic diseases" and worked with Western medicine to jointly prevent the epidemic of this acute infectious disease and rescued more than sixty dying and difficult-to-treat children. This old Chinese medicine practitioner is Mr. Pu Fuzhou.
    Mr. Pu followed his father and grandfather to learn medicine and treat patients since he was a child. He has more than 40 years of clinical experience in "epidemic diseases" (i.e., acute infectious diseases) and gynecology. In addition to his outstanding contributions to the treatment of measles in children, he has also won the praise of the Chinese medicine community for his effectiveness and theory in the treatment of encephalitis B. At present, this old doctor is tackling the world's largest and most difficult disease—esophageal cancer. After his vigorous efforts, he has achieved preliminary results. The medical community believes that this is a valuable gain.
    Seventy-two-year-old Mr. Pu's eyebrows, hair, and beard are all white, as if they have been dyed by frost. When I visited him, he was treating a middle-aged woman for a difficult disease. After liberation, Mr. Pu's spirit became increasingly strong. He often went out for consultations without saying a word of fatigue. I don't know how many people have recovered their health under his treatment. I don't know how many mothers have expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the elderly man because their children were rescued from the brink of death.
    Mr. Pu took a puff of his long leaf tobacco pipe and said with emotion that in the old society, the reactionary government did not pay attention to traditional Chinese medicine, and Chinese medicine practitioners were discriminated against. Before liberation, although he saw many cases in his clinical work, he did not record them, nor did he have the heart to record them. But now? He wants to do his best to sort out his medical experience and pass it on to future generations. Now, the elderly man is leading two Chinese medicine practitioners and three Western medicine apprentices to work. Every week, he also lectures on his clinical experience to Chinese and Western medicine doctors at the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. His more than 40 years of medical experience are also being sorted out by a dedicated person.
    In the old doctor's home, I saw a silk banner with the words: "Breaking Superstition, Liberating Thought, Pioneer of the Technological Revolution in Health and Medicine!" This was awarded to him by the Ministry of Health last year. Now, the elderly man says to people: "We must not only be specialized but also red. We must not be for fame and fortune, but to serve the people well and take the road of being both red and specialized!"
    In our new motherland, there are so many elderly people like He Xiangning, Chen Yuan, Bing Zhi, and Pu Fuzhou! Life is a long river without end, forever surging with waves. The elderly in the new society, like ancient trees, make you full of green branches in spring and gain new life. The magnificent cause of socialism and communism makes you live younger and younger, and you cannot help but dedicate your precious twilight years. Young elders, may you be as evergreen as pine and cypress for ten thousand years!

    老柏长涵万代春
    本报记者　余志恒
    在人生漫长的旅途中，每个老年人都有各自不同的经历和遭遇，但是生活在新中国的老人却有一个共同的心愿：把晚年献给社会主义和共产主义壮丽的事业。
    我访问了这样一些可敬的老人，他们大都经历过四个朝代的变迁。像恶梦一般的黑暗岁月，送走了他们的青春，使他们频添了满头秋霜。然而，今天当你同他们生活在一起的时候，不由得使你感到了一种真正的青春活力。
    这些饱经人世忧患和沧桑的老人，比那些在幸福摇篮里长大的年轻人，是更能够深刻地懂得新中国的可贵的。这就是为什么这些老年人有着一颗像年青人一样燃烧着的心，他们日复一日永无倦容地争取为社会主义大厦再砌上一块砖！
    辛亥革命老人
    在北京，人们经常可以看到一位鬓发霜白的老太太，坐着手推车参加会议，她使人感染到一种坚韧不拔的毅力和焕发的精神，——她就是八十二岁高龄的革命老人何香凝。
    不久以前当记者去访问这位老人时，她从新中国的辉煌成就，谈到共产党和毛主席的英明领导，她是那样的兴奋和激动。她说：“今日之中国，不仅完成了孙中山先生未竟的事业，而且大大的超过了他的理想。中国人不再被称为‘东亚病夫’了，作为一个新中国的国民是多么令人自豪啊！”她一再激动地说：“新中国真是鹏程万里，美景无边，生活在这个时代的老人怎能不更加奋发的工作呢？”
    老人一席兴奋的谈话，不禁使人想起了一件往事：在1957年春天，当右派分子向党和人民猖狂进攻的时候，这位革命老人正值病中，不能参加会议，然而她却抱病写了书面发言和“民革需要整风”等文章，驳斥右派分子的荒谬言论。那时候，她像巨石一样兀立在激流中，维护真理，维护人民和社会主义的事业，她是那样拥护和热爱中国共产党，她说：“只有中国共产党才能领导中国进入社会主义，才能把残破落后的旧中国变成繁荣富强先进的新中国！”
    何香凝老太太虽然这样大年纪了，但是她热情迸发，工作非常认真。她在担任华侨事务委员会主任的九年多时间里，平均每年要处理一千六百多件来自国外华侨和国内侨眷的信件，每封来信都做到“案案有着落，件件有交代”。每当华侨不远千里而来，她纵然病了也要同他们相见。她一直教育侨眷要参加劳动生产。像她这样行动不太方便的老人，去年为大跃进的热潮所鼓舞，年底还去广东的丝厂和人民公社视察。
    在许多名画中，人们可以看到一幅百花盛开、和平鸽双双嬉戏在花丛中的充满了和平气氛的名画“和平颂”，这就是何香凝老太太和齐白石等十四位我国名画家的手笔，这幅画是送给世界和平大会的。现在，老人还不断画画，她说：“在抗战期间，我绘画多是为了拿去义卖，救护伤兵、救济难民。如今，我看到祖国飞跃前进的景象，禁不住要画它几笔，在美妙的境界中，觉得心情格外舒畅！”
    桃李满天下的老教育家
    在一所宁静的四合院里，一位须发斑白的老人，临窗而坐，手拿着放大镜正在专心致意地整理“册府元龟”和旧五代史。他就是从事教育工作六十年的老教育家陈垣。
    几十年来，在他身边成长起无数青年。这些青年有的刚刚作人民教师，有的已担负着领导工作，有的已在科学研究上作出很大成就，有的又和他自己一样，成了“桃李满天下”的老教授。
    是什么力量使他在教育工作岗位坚持了这许多年呢？解放前，面对着黑暗反动统治，陈垣同志曾经怀着满腔忧愤，把个人的理想寄托于百年树人的教育工作，也把祖国的希望寄托于年青的后代。但是，只有在新中国成立之后，当他看到祖国到处都迫切需要建设人才、一批又一批毕业的学生奔向祖国建设岗位的时候，他才第一次感到自己的理想和祖国的需要完全结合在一起，感到浑身都充满新的力量！
    这位曾经作过清末秀才的老人，他虽然已是八十高龄了，却依然好学不倦。数十年如一日，他都是每天清晨四点钟起来，当人们还在熟睡的时候，他的书房里就亮起了灯光。像这样要从四点读书到七点。真是读破了万卷书。如果翻开他所藏的几万册书看一看，差不多每一本都可以看到他思想的烙印——眉批小注，圈圈点点。他在史学方面的著作也很多。在他写“元典章校补”和“校勘学释例”的时候，连搜集各种板本，前后经过二十多年的时间；为了写“中西回史日历”和“二十史朔闰表”二书，曾经用了三年多时间，才把这横贯二千年的历法写成，这是两部对史学研究极有价值的著作。
    凡是过去熟悉他的人，都说：“今天的陈垣先生和过去不一样了！”是的，他变了，变成一位红色老人了。是谁给予他这样巨大的变化呢？用陈垣同志自己的话说：“是党使我获到新的生命”。他在过去的几十年里，看到统治阶级极端腐败，所以他一直不问政治。抗战八年，他只是从家门到校门，在一个胡同里悄悄地度过了八年。解放以后，共产党领导全国人民进行了史无前例的建设，使他真正感到了今天的光明和幸福。他对共产党由不认识到认识，由不了解到钦佩、拥护和爱戴，从此，他决心要把自己献给党和人民的伟大事业！
    在老人的“励耘书屋”的桌上，我发现一个小纸条，那上面写着：“争取做一个红色老人”，这是陈垣同志在1958年整风运动时写的美好的意愿。那端正的一横一竖的墨笔字里，包含着多么旺盛的生命力和宏伟的志向呵！
    探索动物世界秘密的前辈
    远在三十九年前，那时我国还没有动物学这门科学，只有秉志先生在南京东南大学任教时才为我国动物学撒下了第一粒种子。
    就是这位七十多岁的老科学家，他说他自己直到解放后的十年，才真正开始有系统的科学研究工作。用他自己的话来说，解放前许多科学家得不到尊重，不但没有条件进行科学研究，有时连起码的生活条件也难保证。即使东奔西跑想尽办法作些研究，就像“饿马奔槽”，饥不择食。现在呢？压在科学家头上的那种黑暗统治一去不复返了，新中国站了起来，科学事业也在突飞猛进。可以说没有任何一个时代，中国科学家能够像今天这样充分发挥他们自己的才能和智慧。
    “时不可待，机不可失”，十年来，秉志老先生时时刻刻都好像有一股巨大的热力推动着他，使得他每天都孜孜不倦，在实验室里探索动物世界里的秘密。他像一个亲密的朋友一样，不仅熟悉各种动物的相貌、形态，而且也了解它们的五脏六腑、细胞，甚至它们的喜爱。他只有一个宿愿：通过研究动物世界的进化的问题，进一步探索最高级动物——人的进化，特别是道德方面进化的问题。
    这位老人现正在研究鲤鱼的形态。从1953年到现在，成千上万条的鲤鱼在实验室里同老人度过了七个寒暑。七年的心血结晶便是老人最近完成的“鲤鱼解剖学”。这本书是动物学的基础理论，它对水产部门研究鲤鱼的工作很有参考价值。这是他十五年规划中的第一部分。现在他正研究第二部分：“鲤鱼组织学”，还有第三部分：“鲤鱼胚胎学”。秉老先生已经七十多岁了，人生中的晚年时光是多么宝贵呀！他决心要创造出更多的成绩。
    秉老先生对科学事业专注的热情，说来令人感动。他有一种枯草热的疾病，每年都要发作。在发病的时候，他也不肯离开实验室。多少次的失败，他从不灰心，失败了再来。他经常用“三心、三不怕”教育他的青年助手。三心是：决心、信心、恒心。三不怕是：不怕麻烦、不怕困难、不怕失败。他又常常对青年说：“现在你们年轻人是太幸福了，生长在这新的时代里，有这样好的环境，这样好的条件，比起我们那个把实验室变成马槽的乱世之年，不知好了几千万倍。你们不能辜负党和人民对你们的期望啊！”
    这位在前清作过举人的老科学家热情地说，我虽已七十有余，但我的科学事业只不过是才开始哩！最近他写的一首诗，更表达了他的坚强意志：
      百年国步苦遭迍，倏见天回日月新。
      镜里霜头增感喟，灯前蠹简系精神。
      惊雷定起三冬蛰，老柏长涵万代春。
      矻矻毕生今未已，行看健翩出风尘。
    为人民健康操劳的老医师
    今天，有多少中医老先生，继承着祖国医学遗产在为人民的健康而操劳，正当去年北京小儿麻疹和疹后肺炎流行，许多小孩的生命受到死亡威胁的时候，一位鬓发霜白、银须垂胸的老人，运用他几十年来丰富的“瘟病”临床经验，和西医一起共同阻止了这一急性传染病的流行，抢救了六十多个奄奄一息难于治疗的小儿。这位老中医就是蒲辅周老先生。
    蒲老先生从小就跟随他的父亲、祖父学医看病，对于“瘟病”（即急性传染病）和妇科有四十多年的临床经验，除了对治疗小儿麻疹有着卓越的贡献外，在治疗乙型脑炎的疗效和理论上，也博得中医界的赞誉。目前，这位老医师正在攻克世界上最大的疑难病——食道癌，经过他的奋发努力，已收到初步疗效。医学界认为，这是一个可贵的收获。
    七十二岁的蒲老先生，眉毛、头发、胡须像霜染过一样，全都白了，当我去访问他的时候，正逢他给一位中年妇女治疗一个难医之症。解放以后，蒲老先生精神日益旺盛，经常到外面出诊，从不说一声疲劳，不知道多少人在他的治疗下恢复了健康。不知多少母亲的心因为小孩濒于死亡的边缘得救而对老人表示衷心感激。
    蒲老先生一边吸着长长的叶子烟管，一边感慨地说，在旧社会，反动政府不重视祖国医学，中医受到歧视。解放前他虽然在临床工作中所看的病例很多，但都没有记载，也无心记载。而现在呢？他要尽最大努力把自己的医学经验整理出来，留传后代。现在，这位老人正带领着两个中医和三个西医徒弟进行工作，每星期还要向中医研究院的中西医大夫讲授他的临床经验，而他四十多年行医经验也正由专人帮助他进行整理。
    在老医师的家里，我看到一面锦旗，那上面写着：“破除迷信，解放思想，卫生医药技术革命先锋！”这是卫生部在去年奖给他的。现在，这位老人对人说：“不能光专不红，不能为名为利，而是要好好为人民服务，要走又红又专的道路！”
    在我们新生的祖国里，有多少像何香凝、陈垣、秉志、蒲辅周一样的老人啊！漫长的人生，像无止境的长河，永远波涛滚滚。新社会的老人，像古树一样，春天使你绿满枝头，获得了新的生命，社会主义和共产主义壮丽的事业，使你越活越年青，禁不住要把自己珍贵的晚年贡献出来。年轻的老人啊，愿你像松柏一样万年长青！
