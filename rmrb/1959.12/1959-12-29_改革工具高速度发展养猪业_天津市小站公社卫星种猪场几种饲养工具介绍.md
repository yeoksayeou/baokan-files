Editor's Note: On December 13th, this newspaper published news on page two about the Happiness Road Production Team of the Xiaozhan Commune in Tianjin reforming pig farming tools, which has attracted the attention of many readers who have continuously written to request an introduction to the tools they have reformed.

Thanks to the reform of feeding tools, the team's pig inventory has increased from more than 4,000 heads last year to more than 6,000 heads, while saving 104 feeders and 46 livestock; one feeder can feed 200 pigs in 20 minutes.

Now, we are publishing the diagrams of several simple feeding tools from the satellite pig farm of this production team for study by various regions.

	Artificial Milk Feeder
Made of a wooden box with an iron box nested in the middle. Inside the iron box, an iron plate divides it into upper and lower triangular sections from the upper rear to the lower front. The upper half of the iron box holds the milk container, which is connected to the artificial nipple outside the iron box; the lower half contains an appropriate amount of charcoal to keep the milk warm. When in use, lift the lid of the wooden box to expose the nipples, and the piglets can be fed. The current artificial milk feeder at the farm has four nipples, but it can also be fitted with seven or eight nipples, so that many piglets can be fed at the same time, increasing efficiency several times compared to using a glass bottle with one nipple.

	Feed Dryer
The dryer is made from a large iron barrel placed horizontally, with coal burned underneath for heating. A propeller pusher is installed in the middle of the iron barrel, driven by a diesel engine. The feed is loaded from one end, and as the propeller rotates, it mixes the feed while pushing it forward out of the iron barrel. Using this dryer is not only efficient; one iron barrel can dry about 2,000 jin of feed per day. It also saves labor and costs, and the quality of the dried feed is good.

	Automatic Waterer
Previously, piglets drank water from troughs, with water added to the troughs on a regular basis. But sometimes the troughs had water and the pigs didn't drink, and sometimes the pigs wanted to drink but there was no water in the troughs. After much research and experimentation, the farm finally created an automatic waterer. This automatic waterer is based on the principle of scientist Torricelli's atmospheric pressure experiment, using an old iron bucket. The bucket is 50 centimeters high and 30 centimeters in diameter, with a funnel installed at the top for pouring water into the bucket and then sealing it tightly. A piece of iron pipe, about 2 centimeters in diameter, is installed at the bottom of the bucket, extending about 1 centimeter beyond the bucket. The iron bucket is placed in a cement drinking pool and secured with wire. In this way, the water level in the drinking pool can always be maintained at a certain level, flowing as they drink, and not flowing if they don't drink, providing piglets with water to drink freely. To prevent piglets from bathing in the drinking pool, they also divided the area around the drinking pool into several small drinking pools with bricks, so that piglets can only stick their heads in to drink, making it convenient and hygienic.

	Cart and Trough Combined Pig Feeder
In the past, the farm fed pigs by carrying the feed to the pigsties on shoulders and by hand, which was labor-intensive. In addition, the piglets would always scramble and bump around, often knocking over the feed buckets. Based on the above situation, the farm used the two horizontal partitions in the middle of the pig trough as tracks and successfully trial-produced a semi-automatic cart and trough combined pig feeder. When feeding, simply release the rope of the feed cart, and the cart can slide forward automatically by borrowing the slope of the track. An outlet is opened at the bottom of the cart, and the pig feed flows into the trough from here. The characteristics of this tool are: it can save labor and improve efficiency. In the past, feeding pigs with buckets required one person to feed only 40 pigs per day. After using this tool, one person can feed 200 pigs, improving efficiency four times. In addition, it can save feed and facilitate management.

	Farrowing Box
In order to provide a temporary place for newborn piglets to stay before nursing, the farm made a farrowing box. This is a wooden box with a lid, with a hand hole on each side of the box, for easy handling and ventilation. In addition, a small box is attached to each side of the box to store obstetrical supplies and medicines such as scissors, cotton, gray paper, and iodine. After the sow gives birth, the piglets are first placed in the farrowing box, and then called to nurse after the sow has finished giving birth. Using a farrowing box can provide newborn piglets with a warm and comfortable place to stay, improve the survival rate, and prevent the sow from being startled by the piglets' cries, affecting delivery. At the same time, obstetrical tools can be carried with the box, which is convenient and hygienic.

	Pig Trough with Dividers
A divider is added every six inches on the trough, with the lower parts connected. When piglets eat, only their heads can fit in, not their legs, each occupying a small trough. Using this kind of pig trough can avoid wasting feed, keep the feed clean and hygienic, and make the piglets eat evenly and develop in a balanced way.
Water Heating Equipment
Hot water must be used to mix feed in winter, but burning hot water consumes a lot of coal. In order to save expenses and ensure that there is hot water for mixing feed in winter, the farm has created the following three methods of heating water:

	1. Solar Water Heating Pool: This utilizes the heat of the sun to warm the water. Its structure is: the north wall is built of adobe to a height of two meters, and the left and right walls are also built of adobe in a sloped shape, with the upper end meeting the north wall at a 45-degree angle. The empty space between the left and right walls is covered with glass, and the front end reaches directly to the ground. Straw mats are placed on the glass windows, raised at sunrise and covered before sunset. Below the glass windows is a cement pool, which can be used to warm the cold water in the pool using the heat of the sun. A pile of grass and manure one meter deep and one meter wide is placed around the pool to maintain the temperature. A ceramic pipe runs horizontally through the pool, with a chimney leading to the outside, and sawdust can be burned in the stove when necessary, allowing the smoke to pass through the ceramic pipe and escape, increasing the temperature of the water.

	2. Baijiu Lees Water Heating Pool: A lees pool is built in a specially designated room, with six large iron buckets filled with cold water inside the lees pool, and connected to each other internally with iron pipes. The two buckets on the outside are connected to water taps on the outside of the wall for draining water. The buckets are surrounded and covered with baijiu lees, and after one day and night, the water temperature can reach 40 to 60 degrees Celsius, saving one worker compared to burning firewood, and saving 320 jin of firewood. However, baijiu lees can only heat water twice, and the lees must be replaced after two uses, and the replaced lees can still be used as feed.

	3. Stove Back Water Heating Pool: A cement pool one meter wide, three meters long, and one meter deep is built behind the stove, with a ceramic pipe passing through the pool and connected to the stove chimney. In this way, the heat of the smoke and fire is fully utilized, and when 560 jin of cold water are boiled in the pot, the temperature of 3,500 jin of water in the pool can rise to 50 to 70 degrees Celsius.

　　改革工具高速度发展养猪业
    天津市小站公社卫星种猪场几种饲养工具介绍
    编者按：本月13日本报二版发表了天津市郊小站公社幸福之路生产队改革养猪工具的消息，引起了广大读者的重视，不断来信要求介绍他们改革的工具。
    这个生产队由于改革饲养工具，全队存栏猪虽然由去年的四千多头增养到六千多头，却比过去节约了一百零四个饲养员和四十六头牲口；一个饲养员二十分钟就能喂二百头猪。
    现在，我们就把这个生产队卫星种猪场的几种简易饲养工具图刊登出来，供各地研究。
　　人工授乳器
    用木箱一个，中间套一铁盒。铁盒内从后上方至前下方用铁板隔为上下两个三角形部分。铁盒上半部放上盛奶器，并和铁盒外面的代乳器联接一起；下半部放入适量的木炭，使奶温热。使用时将木箱盖掀起，露出乳头，即可给仔猪授乳。该场现有的人工授乳器有乳头四个，也可以安装七、八个乳头，这样可使许多仔猪同时吃奶，比用有一个乳头的玻璃瓶子，能提高效率若干倍。
　　饲料烘干器
    烘干器是用一个大铁桶卧放，下面烧煤加温，铁桶中间安一个螺旋桨推送器，用柴油机带动；自一端装料，螺旋桨转动时，一方面将饲料送进搅拌，另一方面将饲料向前推送出铁桶。使用这种烘干器不仅效率高，一个铁桶一天约可烘干饲料两千斤。而且节省人力和成本，炒的料质量好。
　　自动饮水器
    以前仔猪饮水是用槽子，在槽子里按时添水。但有时槽子里有水猪不喝，又有时猪想喝而槽子里没有水。经过多次研究试验，该场终于创制成功了一种自动饮水器。这个自动饮水器是根据科学家托里拆利的大气压力强度实验原理，利用旧铁桶做成的。桶高五十厘米，直径三十厘米，桶上端装一个漏斗，将水灌入桶内，加盖盖严。桶底安一直径约二厘米的铁管，伸出桶外约一厘米多。将铁桶放在用洋灰制成的饮水池内，用铁丝系牢。这样饮水池内可以永远保持一定的水位，随喝随流，不喝不流，供仔猪自饮。为了不让仔猪到饮水池内洗澡，他们又把饮水池周围用砖分成几个小饮水池，使仔猪只能伸进头去饮水，这样既方便又卫生。
　　车槽联合喂猪器
    该场过去喂猪是用肩担和手提的办法，把饲料运到猪圈里，劳动繁重。再加上小猪总是乱抢乱撞，常把饲料桶撞翻。根据以上情况，该场利用猪槽中间的两道横隔板做轨道，试制成功了半自动车槽联合喂猪器。喂猪时只要把装料车绳子松开，车就能借着轨道的坡度自动向前滑动。车子下面开个出食口，猪食由此流到食槽里。这个工具的特点是：能节省人力，提高效率。过去用桶子挑猪食，一个人一天只能喂四十头猪。使用这个工具以后，一个人可以喂二百头，提高效率四倍。另外，还能节省饲料，便于管理。
    育仔箱
    为了使刚生下来的仔猪在哺乳前暂时有处存放，该场制成了育仔箱。这是一个带盖的木箱，箱的两侧各有一扣手洞，一方面便于搬用，另一方面可流通空气。此外，箱的两侧还各附一小箱，存放剪子、棉花、灰纸、碘酒等接生用具和药品，母猪产仔后，先将仔猪放在育仔箱中，等母猪产完后再叫仔猪吃奶。使用育仔箱可使新生仔猪有温暖舒适的地方存放，提高成活率，并可避免母猪听到仔猪叫唤而受惊，影响分娩。同时，接生工具随箱携带，既方便又卫生。
    带隔板喂猪槽
    在槽上每隔六寸加一隔板，下部连通。小猪吃食时只伸得进头，腿进不去，各占一小槽。使用这种猪槽能避免糟蹋饲料，保持饲料清洁卫生，使小猪吃食均匀，发育平衡。温水设备
    冬天调料必须使用热水，而烧热水费煤很多。为了节省开支，并保证冬天有热水调料，该场创造了以下三种温水方法：
    1、太阳能温水池：是利用太阳的热量将水晒温。它的构造是：北墙用土坯筑成高二米，左右两墙也用土坯筑成坡状，上端与北墙相接处成四十五度角。左右两墙中间的空面铺玻璃，前端直达地面。玻璃窗上设稻草苫子，日出打起，日没前盖上。玻璃窗下为洋灰池，利用太阳的热可将池内的凉水晒温。池的周围放一米深、一米宽的草积粪，以保持温度。池内横穿一缸管，用烟筒引向室外，必要时在灶内烧锯末，使烟通过缸管冒出，以增加水的温度。
    2、白酒糟温水池：在一个特设房间内建一糟池，糟池内设装满凉水的六个大铁桶，内部用铁管互相接通。靠外边的两桶用水龙头通往墙外，以便放水。桶的周围和下边堆满酒糟，经过一昼夜，水的温度可达到摄氏四十至六十度，较用柴烧水节省人工一个，省柴三百二十斤。但白酒糟只能温水两次，使用两次后须换一次糟，换下的糟仍可作饲料。
    3、灶后温水池：在锅灶的后面筑成宽一米五、长三米、深一米的洋灰池一个，用缸管通过池内，缸管与锅灶烟筒接连。这样将烟火的热力充分利用起来，锅内每烧沸五百六十斤凉水时，池内三千五百斤水的温度可上升到摄氏五十至七十度。（附图片）
