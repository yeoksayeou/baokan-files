　　——After Viewing the Exhibition of Fine Arts of the Mongolian People's Republic

    The "Exhibition of Fine Arts of the Mongolian People's Republic" has opened in Beijing. Following the "Exhibition of Fine Arts of the Mongolian People's Republic" held in our country in 1954 and the "Exhibition of Folk Patterns of the Mongolian People's Republic" held in our country in 1958, our people have once again had a good opportunity to appreciate the highly accomplished artistic works of the Mongolian people, which is truly gratifying. Through this exhibition, we can gain a deeper understanding of the Mongolian people's socialist construction and new life, as well as the development of their fine arts.
    In the exhibition, whether it is painting, oil painting, printmaking, propaganda posters, cartoons, or sculptures in traditional forms, all reflect the achievements of Mongolian artists in following the path of socialist realism. Many outstanding works have been warmly welcomed by our people.
    The content of the exhibited works is rich and diverse. Not only is it closely integrated with the lives of the broad masses of people, but it also creatively develops the characteristics of national art. For example, the painter D. Damdinsuren's "Loving Mother" uses traditional forms of expression to reflect the happy life of mothers and children in the socialist era, with a natural and harmonious picture. U. Yadamsuren also successfully used traditional forms to express the image of the Mongolian people in his works "Folk Artist" and "Female Artist."
    The oil paintings are also of a high standard. When I discovered that painters I was familiar with in the past had many successful new works in this exhibition, I couldn't help but sincerely congratulate them. I remember that in the "Exhibition of Fine Arts of the Mongolian People's Republic" held in Beijing in 1954, a portrait of an actress by the painter G. Odon attracted people's attention and was fascinating to see; while this time, his oil paintings "Guerrilla Hasbater," "Miner," and "In the Calf House" vividly and concretely reflect the heroic struggles of the Mongolian people in the past and their current peaceful labor life, with bright colors and vivid and moving images. O. Tsebexjav's "Fighting Stallions" is also a successful work. The author chose the theme of two horses fighting and vividly and realistically depicted the horses' expressions in the picture, which can evoke more associations in people.
    Many works show us the love of the Mongolian people and artists for the happy socialist life, and their love for the beautiful mountains and rivers of their socialist motherland. N. Tsultem is the chairman of the Mongolian People's Republic Artists Association. He is an enthusiastic and energetic artist who is also very diligent in artistic creation. The oil paintings "Clouds," "Foothills," "Weaving Carpet," and "Music Lesson" in the exhibition are all his works, overflowing with the author's love for the motherland and the people. In addition, C. Budabasr's oil painting "Going to Vote," G. Chimiddorj's oil painting "Mountain Peaks," B. Gombosuren's oil painting "A Street," etc., are all outstanding works in this regard.
    From the exhibition, we also saw the creative achievements of Mongolian artists in printmaking, propaganda posters, and cartoons. L. Damba's propaganda poster "Forward to Socialism" gives people a great inspiring force; D. Lobtsanzhamsu's "Soyombo," a symbol of independence and autonomy, is an excellent work with national style.
    Sculpture is also a very prominent part of the exhibition. The eighteen sculptures, including bronze, root carvings, papier-mâché, plaster, wood carvings, and other materials, each have a unique style, demonstrating the sculptors' outstanding talents. Makhabaatar's "Head of a Guerrilla Fighter" vividly portrays the image of a heroic figure from the era of revolutionary struggle; from all sides, we can see that every part has been carefully carved by the author. Duinbala's "Wrestler" not only shows the vigorous physique of the working people, but also emphasizes the people's love for life and joyful emotions through this form. Damdinmaa's "Cow" has a novel shape and humorously and completely depicts the scene of taming a cow. This work, although small, is pleasing.
    I have been to the Mongolian People's Republic and traveled and visited various places. The life and construction achievements of the Mongolian people have left me with an extremely deep impression. Therefore, seeing these works makes me feel even more cordial. I am deeply delighted by the high achievements of the artists of the Mongolian People's Republic. There is no doubt that this exhibition will play an extremely important role in enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples and strengthening cultural and artistic exchanges between the two countries.

　　草原上的花朵
　　——蒙古人民共和国造型艺术展览会观后
    张悟真
    “蒙古人民共和国造型艺术展览会”在北京开幕了。继1954年在我国举办的“蒙古人民共和国美术展览会”和1958年在我国举办的“蒙古人民共和国民间图案展览会”之后，我国人民又得到一次很好的机会来欣赏具有高度水平的蒙古人民的艺术作品，真是令人非常高兴。通过这个展览会，我们对于蒙古人民社会主义的建设事业和新的生活面貌，以及造型艺术事业的发展，都可以得到进一步的了解。
    展览会中，不论是传统形式的绘画、油画、版画、宣传画、漫画或雕塑作品，都体现了蒙古美术家遵循社会主义现实主义创作道路所获得的成就。其中许多出色的作品，受到了我国人民热烈的欢迎。
    展出作品的内容，是丰富多采的。不仅与广大的人民生活有着紧密的结合，而且也创造性地发展了民族艺术的特色。例如画家德·达姆丁苏伦的“慈母”，就是运用了传统的表现形式，反映了社会主义时代的母亲和孩子们幸福的生活，画面自然和谐。乌·亚达姆苏伦在“民间艺人”和“女艺人”两幅作品中，也运用了传统形式表现了蒙古人民的形象，十分成功。
    油画作品，也有很高的水平。当我发现过去所熟识的画家在这次展出中有许多成功的新作品时，不禁衷心向他们祝贺。记得1954年在北京举行的“蒙古人民共和国美术展览会”中，画家格·敖登的一幅女演员肖像曾引起人们的注意，看后令人神往；而这次他的油画“游击队员哈斯巴特尔”、“矿工”、“在小牛房里”则又生动具体地反映了蒙古人民过去英勇的斗争和现在和平劳动的生活，色彩鲜明，形象生动感人。敖·色布格扎布的“公马相斗”也是一幅成功的作品，作者选择了两马相斗为题材并在画面中生动逼真地刻划了马的神态，通过它能引起人更多的联想。
    许多作品，都向我们展示出蒙古人民和美术家对于社会主义的幸福生活的热爱，对社会主义祖国绚丽的山川景物的热爱。纳·楚勒都木是蒙古人民共和国美协的主席，他是一位热情充沛的艺术家，在艺术创作上也很勤奋，展览会中的油画“云”、“山麓”、“织地毯”、“音乐课”等都是他的作品，洋溢着作者对祖国对人民的热爱。此外，车·布达巴斯尔的油画“去参加选举”，格·齐仁敦道格的油画“山峰”，巴·官布苏伦的油画“一条街”等，都是这方面出色的作品。
    从展览会中，我们还看到蒙古美术家在版画和宣传画、漫画等方面的创作成就。勒·丹巴的宣传画“向社会主义前进”给人的巨大的鼓舞力量；德·罗布伦扎木苏所绘的独立自主的标志“苏阳布”，更是具有民族风格的佳作。
    雕塑在展览会中也是很突出的一部分。十八件包括青铜、树根雕刻、纸浆、石膏、木雕等方面材料的雕塑作品，每一件都具有独特的风格，表现了雕刻家们卓越的才能。玛哈保勒的“游击队员头像”，生动地塑造了在革命斗争年代里的英雄人物的形象；从四面来看，我们看出每一个地方都经过作者精心的刻划。都因巴拉的“摔跤手”，不但表现了劳动人民生气勃勃的体魄，同时通过这一造型着重反映出人民对于生活的热爱和欢欣的情绪。达木丁玛的“牛”，造型新颖，富有情趣而幽默地把驯牛的情节完整地刻划出来，这一件作品，虽不大，却引人喜欢。
    我曾到过蒙古人民共和国，曾在各地旅行参观，蒙古人民的生活和建设成就，留给我极其深刻的印象，因此，看到这些作品，更加感到亲切，我深深为蒙古人民共和国的艺术家所达到的高度成就而欢欣，通过这次展览会，无疑对于增进中蒙两国人民的友谊和加强两国文化艺术交流，将起着极其重大的作用。
