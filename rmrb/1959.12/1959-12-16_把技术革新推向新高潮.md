    An important task of current newspaper propaganda is to vigorously promote the mass technological innovation movement, reflect new situations and new experiences in the movement, raise problems to be solved, and promote the continuous development of the movement. In this regard, the Tianjin Daily provides some good experiences.

    For more than a month, in addition to highlighting the reporting and promotion of the advanced experience introduced at the National "Heroes' Conference", the Tianjin Daily also clarified tasks, explained principles, analyzed thinking, and promoted experience through a series of commentaries and news, focusing on the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization. From November 8th to the present, seven editorials have been published, discussing some important issues in technological innovation. These are: the necessity of combining hard work, practical work, and clever work to vigorously engage in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization; only by relying on our own efforts and combining foreign and local methods to vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results; we must take anti-rightism as the key, and only with continuous ideological revolution can technology be continuously innovated; the implementation of mechanization and semi-mechanization is the wish and demand of the broad masses of workers, and it also involves the labor of every worker in factories and enterprises, so we must vigorously engage in mass movements; the masses' technological innovation proposals are new things in production technology, and we must fully support and seize the opportunity to realize these innovation proposals; to carry out technological innovation, we must plan and act simultaneously, and according to the spirit of "combining the near and the far", achieve "immediate results"; on the capital construction front, technological innovation must move towards construction mechanization and factory production.

    It is worth mentioning that when the Tianjin Daily published the above seven editorials, it simultaneously published typical reports on this issue six times, so that discussion and facts were effectively coordinated to strengthen the propaganda effect. For example, the newspaper on November 8th published an editorial discussing the necessity of technological innovation and a report on the sharp monthly increase in production at the Textile Machinery Factory since August. The news stated that this factory only completed 32% of its annual plan from January to July this year. However, since August, it has been anti-rightist, encouraging enthusiasm, and carrying out mass technological innovation and technological revolution movements, and the production outlook has changed rapidly. The factory completed 40% of its annual plan in August, September, and October, and it was completed better month by month; next year, without adding manpower and equipment, production can be doubled again. These facts powerfully proved the viewpoint in the editorial: if we want to increase production without increasing manpower and combine work and rest, we can only combine hard work, practical work, and clever work, vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, and rapidly increase labor productivity. While publishing the above series of editorials and reports, the newspaper also published short commentaries in a timely manner in conjunction with some specific issues in technological innovation; or in commentaries and reports on other production issues and employee technical education issues, it talked about the relationship between these tasks and technological innovation. In this way, it can supplement the shortcomings of the above editorials and typical reports, so that large and small commentaries and reports can cooperate with each other.

    When reporting on technological innovation, the Tianjin Daily paid attention to embodying the spirit of simplicity first and self-reliance; and used facts to illustrate that this can achieve the goal of eliminating heavy labor and saving labor force faster. The report of the Fifth Tool Factory is a vivid example. The workers of this factory put forward a bold slogan in the large-scale technological innovation: "Small factory, poor equipment, few people, great ambition, use small hammers and local methods to make electric hammers mechanized". After more than two months of efforts, 60% of the forging has been mechanized, and more than 60 forgers have "put down the sledgehammer and operated the electric hammer, working without fatigue and with high efficiency". The newspaper has also continuously published reports in this area, such as: the shoe factory uses a combination of foreign and local methods to engage in technological innovation, so that half of the workers stand up from small stools and work on machines; the Jiahe County No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant relies on its own efforts and uses local methods to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization; Wuqing County has carried out innovation in the grain processing industry, which occupies a large amount of labor and animal power, and has achieved mechanized flour milling; the packaging department of the Aluminum Products Factory has changed the handling to use conveyor belts, and the workers of Tiangang No. 1 Factory have put down the carrying poles to make handling mechanized, and so on. When reporting the news of the aluminum products factory and Tiangang No. 1 Factory's innovation in transportation work, the newspaper also pointed out in a short commentary: At present, many units rely on carrying, lifting, and pulling to carry out transportation work, which occupies a lot of manpower. There is great potential for large-scale technological innovation in handling work. Moreover, there are many ways to manufacture handling and loading and unloading machinery, and it is easy to engage in "local" methods, so we must go from local to foreign and gradually go upstairs.

    The Tianjin Daily also paid attention to reflecting the situation of technological innovation in various industries and various examples of technological innovation by employees, to illustrate the mass nature of technological innovation and attract people to the movement. From the scope of innovation, it reported on heavy and light industries such as steel, machinery, chemical, textile, and transportation, as well as technological innovation in production supply and life services such as finance and trade departments, street industries, and public canteens; it reported on both urban and rural areas in the suburbs, such as water conservancy construction, grain processing, and pig and chicken raising in various counties. Moreover, there are both veteran workers and young workers, as well as technicians and management personnel; there are both enterprise employees and street women. In these reports, it can be seen that people in every corner and on various posts are vigorously engaging in technological innovation.

    In this report, the Tianjin Daily adopted a variety of reporting forms to reflect the extensive technological innovation activities. For example, in conjunction with some news, it published the personal brief communication "Farewell, Sledgehammer!" and short articles praising technological innovation written by veteran workers. In the supplement, it published a feature describing the workers' enthusiasm, "Our Innovation Station". A new worker wrote a letter to the editorial department, saying that his technical level was low, how could he talk about innovation; the newspaper publicly answered the reason why "workers with short seniority can also engage in innovation" in the "Mailbox" column.

    把技术革新推向新高潮
    当前报纸宣传的一个重要任务，就是要大张旗鼓地宣传群众性的技术革新运动，反映运动中的新情况新经验，提出问题加以解决，推动运动不断向前发展。在这方面，天津日报提供了一些较好的经验。
    一个多月来，天津日报除了比较突出地报道和推广全国“群英会”上介绍的先进经验之外，还通过一系列的评论和新闻，围绕着以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，来讲清任务，交代方针，分析思想，推广经验。从11月8日到现在，已经发表七篇社论，论述了技术革新中的一些重要问题。这就是：把苦干、实干和巧干结合起来，大搞以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的必要性；自力更生、洋土并举地大闹机械化和半机械化，才能作到又多又快又好又省；必须以反右倾为纲，只有思想不断革命，技术才能不断革新；实行机械化、半机械化是广大工人群众的心愿和要求，也关涉到工厂企业每个工人的劳动，因此必须大搞群众运动；群众的技术革新建议是生产技术上的新事物，必须全力支持和抓紧实现这些革新建议；开展技术革新就要边规划、边行动，根据“远近结合”精神，收到“立竿见影”之效；在基本建设战线上，技术革新要向施工机械化和工厂化迈进。
    值得提到的是，天津日报在发表上述七篇社论的时候，六次都同时发表有关这一问题的典型报道材料，使议论和事实有力地配合，来加强宣传效果。例如，11月8日的报纸，发表了论述技术革新必要性的社论和纺织机械厂8月份以来生产逐月猛升的报道。消息中说明，这个厂今年1至7月份只完成了全年计划的32％。但自8月份起，反右倾、鼓干劲，开展了群众性技术革新和技术革命运动，生产面貌迅速改变，8、9、10三个月完成了全年计划的40％，而且是一月比一月完成的好；明年不添人和设备，生产可以再翻一番。这些事实，有力地证明了社论中的论点：既要增产不增人，又要劳逸结合，就只有把苦干、实干和巧干结合起来，大搞以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命，高速度地提高劳动生产率。报纸在发表上述一系列社论、报道的同时，还结合技术革新中一些具体问题，及时发表短评；或者在其他生产问题和职工技术教育问题的评论和报道中，讲到这些工作和技术革新的关系。这样，就能够补充上述社论和典型报道之不足，使大小评论和报道互相配合。
    天津日报报道技术革新的时候，注意了体现简易为主、自力更生的精神；而且用事实说明，这样才能更快地达到消灭笨重劳动和节省劳动力的目标。第五工具厂的报道就是一个生动的例子。这个工厂的工人在大搞技术革新中，提出了一个豪迈的口号：“厂小设备差，人少志气大，用小鎯头土办法，做成电锤机械化”。经过两个多月的努力，就有60％的锻造实现了机械化，有六十多名锻工“放下大锤操电锤，干活不累效力高”。报纸还连续地登出了这一方面的报道，例如：制鞋厂用洋土结合的办法搞技术革新，使一半工人从小布凳上站起来，到机器上干活去；交河县第一钢铁厂自力更生，用土办法实现机械化半机械化；武清县在占用大量劳力畜力的粮食加工业中搞革新，实现了磨面机械化；铝品厂包装部搬运改用传送带，天钢一厂工人放下扁担使搬运走向机械化，等等。在报道铝品厂和天钢一厂革新运输工作的消息的时候，报纸还在短评中指出：目前许多单位靠背、抬、扛、拉进行运输工作，占用人力很多，在搬运工种大搞技术革新的潜力很大。而且制造搬运装卸机械的门径较多，容易搞“土”的，因此就要由土到洋，逐步上楼。
    天津日报还注意反映各行各业开展技术革新的情况，和各种职工革新技术的事例，来说明技术革新的群众性，吸引人们到运动中来。从革新的范围来说，既报道了钢铁、机械、化工、纺织、交通等重轻工业和交通运输方面的，又报道了财贸部门、街道工业、公共食堂等生产供应和生活服务方面的技术革新；既报道了城市中的，又报道了市郊农村各县水利建设、粮食加工、养猪养鸡中的技术革新。而且，既有老工人和青年工人，又有技术人员和管理人员；既有企业职工，又有街道妇女。在这些报道里，可以看到各个角落和各种岗位上的人们，都在大搞技术革新。
    天津日报在这一报道中，采用了多种多样的报道形式，来反映具有广泛性的技术革新活动。例如，配合一些新闻，发表“别了，大锤！”的人物小通讯，和老工人写的赞扬技术革新的短文。在副刊上，登出了描写工人干劲的特写“我们的革新站”。一个新工人写信给编辑部，说他技术水平低，哪能谈到革新；报纸就在“信箱”栏里，公开解答了“工龄短的工人也能搞革新”的道理。
