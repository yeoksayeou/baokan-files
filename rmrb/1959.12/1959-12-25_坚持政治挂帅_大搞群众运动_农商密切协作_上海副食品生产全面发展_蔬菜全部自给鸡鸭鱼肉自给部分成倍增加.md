　　Adhere to Putting Politics in Command, Vigorously Launch Mass Movements, and Promote Close Cooperation Between Agriculture and Commerce
    Shanghai's Production of Non-Staple Foods Achieves All-Around Development
    Vegetables Completely Self-Sufficient, Self-Sufficiency in Chicken, Duck, Fish, and Meat Increases Many Times Over
    (Our Dispatch) Shanghai's agricultural and commercial departments and suburban people's communes, through joint efforts and the active implementation of the non-staple food production policy of "primarily relying on self-reliance, striving for foreign aid as a supplement," have achieved tremendous results.
    The rapid development of suburban non-staple food production and the continuous increase in the self-supplied portion of market supply commodities is the first significant result of actively implementing this policy. Last year, 30% of vegetables in the fourth quarter needed to be supplied from other places; this year, complete self-sufficiency has been achieved, with an average of about one catty per resident per day. The production quantity of poultry and livestock has grown rapidly. By the end of October, the number of pigs raised in the city increased by 40% compared to the total number raised last year; chickens and ducks increased sevenfold compared to the end of last year; and the number of fish fry released increased even more. In the third quarter, the amount of pigs, poultry, and aquatic products transferred from the suburbs to the urban area exceeded the first quarter by one to dozens of times. The number of dairy cows, geese, sheep, rabbits, bees raised, and fruit trees cultivated in the suburbs has also increased this year. Secondly, the great development of non-staple food production has provided a considerable amount of fertilizer for agricultural production. According to relevant departmental materials, the suburban areas provided more than 65 million dan of livestock and poultry manure this year, equivalent to the output of a chemical fertilizer plant with an annual output of 33,000 tons. Furthermore, self-reliantly developing non-staple food production has greatly promoted the all-around development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the suburban people's communes, enlivened the rural economy, and increased the income of the communes and their members. Many communes have used the increased income from the development of non-staple food production to purchase agricultural machinery needed for expanded reproduction and to establish commune-run industries such as chemical fertilizer plants and feed processing plants. Many poor teams have caught up with the rich teams.
    The reason why Shanghai has achieved such great achievements in non-staple food production in such a short period of time this year is primarily due to the strengthening of the Party's leadership and the establishment of the idea among the vast number of cadres and the masses that the city's non-staple food production can gradually become self-sufficient. Shanghai, a large city with a population of nearly seven million in the urban area, requires a large quantity and variety of non-staple foods. In the initial stage of proposing the policy of "primarily relying on self-reliance, striving for foreign aid as a supplement," some cadres lacked confidence and felt that there were many difficulties; some people opposed agriculture and animal husbandry, believing that raising more poultry and livestock would affect agricultural production. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly educated cadres at all levels and criticized various forms of right-leaning, fear-of-difficulty thinking. The Municipal Committee required all cadres to see the situation clearly, change the old concept of simply relying on other places, make full use of Shanghai's favorable conditions of mild climate and the availability of rivers, lakes, and ponds in the suburbs, and be self-reliant and thorough revolutionaries. The Municipal Committee pointed out that agriculture and animal husbandry are interdependent and promote each other, and that developing suburban non-staple food production is not only a fast, good, and economical way to solve the urban non-staple food supply, but also a good way to promote the all-around development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the people's communes and to prosper the rural economy. In terms of organizational measures, specialized agencies were established or designated personnel were assigned to lead non-staple food production at every level, from the Municipal Committee to the commune production teams. The secretaries of the Party committees at all levels personally took charge, grasping planning, measures, and inspections; cadres went deep into the fields and pig pens to help the masses solve problems in production.
    In the process of developing non-staple food production, some people encountered difficulties such as seed, feed, and shed shortages, which led to feelings of difficulty and even requests to halt production. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees at all levels, on the one hand, adhered to putting politics in command and struggled against these right-leaning thoughts; on the other hand, they mobilized the masses to tap potential, be self-reliant, and advocate "poor" raising. If there were not enough piglets, they adopted the method of keeping every sow that was pregnant, selecting after keeping them. In terms of feed, everyone took action to open up feed sources and widely used green and coarse feed instead of refined feed. If there was not enough material to build poultry and livestock sheds, the Party committees at all levels led the masses to build simple pig sheds by using local materials. Facts have shown that "poor" methods not only overcame various difficulties in practical work, but also enabled non-staple food production to develop at a high speed.
    Shanghai has focused on grasping non-staple food production, with livestock and poultry as the key, and adopted the two-pronged approach of public and private raising, collective and decentralized raising, and urban and rural raising, fully mobilizing the positive factors in all aspects. Actively expanding collective breeding is the main aspect of Shanghai's high-speed development of non-staple food production. Taking pigs as an example, at the end of October, collective breeding accounted for 83.2% of the city's total number of pigs in pens. While developing collective breeding, private breeding by commune members is also encouraged. Utilizing their scattered pigsties and chicken coops, small plots of land in front of and behind their houses, their sporadic labor time, and auxiliary family labor, the amount of poultry and livestock raised in society can be increased.
    Seizing critical periods, launching mass movements, and promoting continuous leaps forward in production—this is an important experience gained by Shanghai in developing non-staple food production. Since the beginning of this year, several production upsurges have been launched in succession. During the spring season of livestock and poultry breeding and reproduction, a movement was launched to ensure that sows were pregnant and to vigorously engage in the hatching of chickens, ducks, and freshwater fish, laying a solid foundation for the great development this year. October is the season when green feed grows vigorously and is easy to store. In order for poultry and livestock to better survive the winter and prepare for a greater leap forward in non-staple food production next year, the method of combining cadres and the masses was adopted to conduct a large-scale inspection and comparison from bottom to top, criticizing the complacency and slackening of some cadres who believed that the development of production was a foregone conclusion, and vigorously engaging in green feed harvesting. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a city-wide pig-raising work conference to summarize the feeding and management experience gained this year and launched a production upsurge for developing pig-raising next year.
    Close coordination and cooperation between agriculture and commerce is another important experience in Shanghai's great development of non-staple food this year. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the two sides jointly established a headquarters to uniformly lead the city's non-staple food production. The agricultural departments not only focused on production but also on procurement; the commercial departments not only did a good job in procurement but also cared about production. It is easier for agricultural departments to discover problems in production and solve them promptly by focusing on procurement. This summer there was a severe drought, and the commercial departments immediately supported more than 100 water pumps to assist in drought resistance, ensuring the normal growth of vegetables; in winter, when communes built vegetable greenhouses, they promptly supplied nearly 10,000 boxes of glass. In addition, the commercial departments widely collected vegetable roots and skins, residents' swill, and rice-washing water in the urban area to supply rural pig-raising; veterinary personnel from their affiliated breeding farms were sent to assist communes in preventing and controlling poultry and livestock diseases.

　　坚持政治挂帅　大搞群众运动　农商密切协作
    上海副食品生产全面发展
    蔬菜全部自给鸡鸭鱼肉自给部分成倍增加
    本报讯　上海市农业、商业部门和郊区人民公社共同努力，积极贯彻“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的副食品生产方针，已经取得巨大成果。
    郊区副食品生产飞跃发展，市场供应商品的自给部分不断增长，是积极贯彻这一方针取得的第一个显著成果。去年第四季度蔬菜30％需要外地供应，今年已经全部自给，平均每天每个居民一斤左右。家禽家畜的生产数量迅速增长。到10月底，全市养猪量比去年全年饲养数增加40％；鸡鸭比去年年底增加七倍；放养的鱼种增加更多。第三季度郊区调入市区的猪、家禽和水产品，超过了第一季度一倍到数十倍。郊区饲养的奶牛、鹅、羊、兔、蜜蜂和栽培的果树，今年也都有增加。其次，副食品生产的大发展，为农业生产提供了相当数量的肥源。据有关部门材料，郊区今年提供的畜粪、禽粪在六千五百万担以上，相当于一个年产三万三千吨化肥厂的产量。再次，自力更生发展副食品生产，大大促进了郊区人民公社农林牧副渔的全面发展，农村经济活跃，公社和社员的收入增加。许多公社由于副食品生产发展，收入增多，添置了扩大再生产需要的农业机械，办起了化肥厂、饲料加工厂等社办工业。许多穷队赶上了富队。
    上海市在今年短短的时间内取得副食品生产上这样巨大的成就，首先是由于加强了党的领导，在广大干部和群众中树立了城市副食品生产可以逐步自给这一思想的结果。上海这个市区人口近七百万的大城市，所需的副食品数量既大，品种又多。在提出“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针初期，有些干部信心不足，感到困难重重；有些人把农业、畜牧业对立起来，认为多养家禽家畜就要影响农业生产。中共上海市委及时向各级干部进行教育，批判了形形色色的右倾畏难思想。市委要求全体干部看清形势，改变单纯依靠外地的旧观念，充分利用上海气候温和、郊区拥有江河湖塘的有利条件，自力更生，做彻底的革命派。市委指出，农业和畜牧业相互依存、促进，发展郊区副食品生产，不但是一条解决城市副食品供应的多快好省的道路，而且是促进人民公社农林牧副渔全面发展、繁荣农村经济的好办法。在组织措施上，从市委到公社生产队，层层建立专门机构或指定专人领导副食品生产。各级党委书记亲自挂帅，抓规划，抓措施，抓检查；干部深入田间、猪棚，帮助群众解决生产中的问题。
    在发展副食品生产中，有些人遇到种苗、饲料、棚舍等困难，产生了畏难情绪，甚至要求下马。中共上海市委和各级党委一面坚持政治挂帅，同这些右倾思想进行斗争；一面发动群众，挖掘潜力，自力更生，提倡穷养。猪苗不够，采取见母必留，先留后选的办法解决。在饲料方面，人人动手开辟饲料来源，广泛采用青粗饲料代替精饲料。建筑禽畜棚舍的材料不足，各级党委就领导群众就地取材自建简易猪棚。事实表明，穷办法不仅克服了实际工作中的各种困难，而且使得副食品生产得到了高速度的发展。
    上海大抓副食品生产，以家畜家禽为重点，采取公养和私养、集体养和分散养、城镇养和农村养等两条腿走路的方针，把各方面的积极因素充分调动起来。积极扩大集体饲养是上海高速度发展副食品生产的主要方面。以猪为例，10月底，属于集体饲养的占全市圈存总量的83.2％。在发展集体饲养的同时，也鼓励社员私养。利用他们分散的猪圈鸡棚、宅前屋后的小块土地和他们的零星劳动时间，以及家庭辅助劳动力，增加社会的家禽家畜饲养量。
    抓住关键性时期，大搞群众运动，推动生产不断跃进。这是上海市在发展副食品生产中取得的一项重要经验。今年以来，连续掀起了好多次生产高潮。在春天禽畜配种繁殖的季节，开展了母猪满怀、大搞鸡鸭和淡水鱼孵化的运动，为今年的大发展打下可靠的基础。10月份是青饲料生长旺盛便于贮藏的季节，为了让禽畜更好地过冬，为明年副食品生产更大跃进作好准备，采取干部和群众相结合的办法，自下而上逐级开展了大检查、大评比，批判了部分干部认为生产发展已成定局的自满松劲情绪，大搞青饲料收割。最近，中共上海市委又召开全市养猪工作会议，总结今年来的饲养管理经验，掀起了为明年发展养猪的生产热潮。
    农商密切协作配合，是今年上海副食品大发展的另一个重要经验。在中共上海市委领导下，双方联合成立指挥部，统一领导全市的副食品生产。农业部门既抓生产，又抓收购；商业部门既做好收购，又关心生产。农业部门抓收购，便于发现生产中的问题及时加以解决。今年夏季严重干旱，商业部门立即支援了一百多台抽水机，协助抗旱，保证了蔬菜的正常生长；公社冬天建造蔬菜暖房，又及时供应了近一万箱玻璃。此外，商业部门还在市区广泛收集菜根菜皮、居民的泔脚和淘米水，供应农村养猪；派出所属饲养场的兽医人员，协助公社防治禽畜疾病。
