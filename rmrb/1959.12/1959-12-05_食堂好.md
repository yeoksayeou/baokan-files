The mess hall is good: "The general line shines brightly, the Party and Chairman Mao are like our parents. In the summer, cool sheds are built to ward off the heat; in the winter, warm jars are made to ward off the cold. Life is getting better and better every day, and the public mess hall is infinitely happy.
