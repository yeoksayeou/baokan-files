Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 30th - Fock Jenő, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, delivered a report on the second item on the agenda, concerning the Second Five-Year Plan for the National Economy, at the Party's Seventh Congress on November 30th.

Fock said that two months before the Party Congress convened, the Party Central Committee published instructions on "Solving Economic Tasks and Formulating the Guidelines for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," stipulating that during the Second Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), our main task is to lay the foundation of socialism and accelerate socialist construction. According to this main task, we will increase industrial and agricultural production by improving productivity and technical level, reorganizing the structure of the national economy, strengthening production economization, and changing ownership in agriculture, and on this basis, continue to improve the people's living standards.

Fock said that in determining the tasks of socialist construction in our country, we proceed from the objective conditions of our national economy and rely primarily on domestic forces. We use the rich experience accumulated by the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies in building socialism in many ways, based on the characteristics of our national economy. We should avoid both exaggerating national characteristics and mechanically copying experience.

Fock pointed out that the Party Central Committee's instructions on the Second Five-Year Plan put forward the main proportions in the development of the national economy. The instructions stipulate that industrial production must be increased by 65% to 70%, agricultural production by 30% to 32%, and national income must increase by at least 50%. In developing heavy industry, we will specialize in developing certain industrial sectors and producing certain products based on our most favorable natural and economic conditions.

According to the instructions, the majority of the increased production must be achieved through increased labor productivity. During this period, industrial labor productivity will increase by 37% to 40%, which means that two-thirds of the increase in production must be guaranteed by improving labor productivity. Due to the growth of the consumption fund, the real income of workers and peasants in 1965 may be 26% to 29% higher than in 1958.

Fock said that we believe that the main way to improve labor productivity in the future is still to continue to implement the economic policies that have already been implemented in the Three-Year Plan at a higher level. To this end, we must fully consider economic principles in the future, study the issue of improving the technical level, and the issue of reorganizing the industrial structure.

He pointed out that during the Five-Year Plan period, coal production will increase by 15% to 20%, oil production will double, gas production will double, and electricity production will be 72% to 75% higher than in 1958.

In the machinery industry, priority should be given to the development of the instrument industry, communication equipment, strong current equipment, chemical industry machinery, and food industry machinery production. More complex and more valuable specialized machine tools and diesel locomotives should be produced. In the steel industry, the quality of products should be improved first, the variety of products should be increased, and the production of high-quality steel, precision steel plates, and cold-rolled steel should be developed. The production capacity of various cold-rolled steel products will increase by 80% compared with 1958.

He pointed out that, according to the instructions of the Five-Year Plan, special attention should be paid to the development of aluminum production, and chemical industry production should be doubled.

Fock also talked about the need to thoroughly replace the machinery and equipment of the light industry and food industry, and improve the technical level of the construction industry and the transportation industry. Fock said that during the Five-Year Plan period, 74% of the state's investment will directly serve production purposes, and 42% to 43% of the production investment will be used for investment in machinery and equipment. When talking about the geographical distribution of industry, Fock said that we will make greater efforts to accelerate industrial development outside the capital.

Fock emphasized that the enthusiasm of the working masses in the technical innovation movement is one of the important factors in improving the technical level, and economic leaders should recognize the rich experience of the working people embodied in innovation and creation and the great power to promote development.

He said: The fruitful work of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, composed of the Soviet Union and other European socialist countries, and the gradually expanding economic cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp, guarantees the development of our national economy, facilitates our formulation of long-term plans, promotes scientific research, and enables us to formulate plans more reliably. Specialization of production and the advanced labor organization resulting from it are the driving force and prerequisite for improving the technical level.

Fock said that in order to continue to develop the national economy in a healthy way, agricultural production should also be greatly increased. At present, large-scale operations are carried out on about 50% of the cultivated land area in Hungary. In the next few years, we will take a big step forward in creating advanced large-scale production. According to the Central Committee's instructions on economic tasks and the formulation of the Second Five-Year Plan, by 1965, the number of tractors will be two and a half times that of 1958, the application of chemical fertilizers will be doubled, and the irrigated area will increase from the current 150,000 hectares to 360,000 hectares.

Fock also pointed out that the socialist agricultural sector should vigorously improve and develop the pig industry and household breeding industry.

He said: We must further develop and consolidate the existing agricultural production cooperatives politically and economically. All necessary conditions must be created to persuade individual farmers, and cooperate with them, to end the socialist transformation of agriculture in the next few years.

Fock said that continuing to improve leadership level is one of the main requirements for further developing the national economy and implementing the plan. The achievements made in the past three years are also due to the fact that the principle of democratic centralism has been implemented more thoroughly in leading the economy than in the past few years. We have strengthened the central leadership on several issues of decisive significance in the development of the national economy, while delegating the power to handle countless affairs to lower-level economic departments. We will continue to do so in the future, and we must simplify unnecessary levels in economic leadership institutions and overcome bureaucratic leadership methods.

He also said that the principle of material benefit has been implemented more correctly than in previous years, which has greatly contributed to this development. However, we oppose the view that these achievements are only dependent on material incentives. There have been many examples in the process of socialist construction that prove that people with socialist conviction of victory and socialist consciousness, in response to the Party's call, can also create miracles and thus be able to give great inspiration to the broad masses of working people, provided that the task has been clearly and unanimously affirmed. It would be an irreparable mistake if someone ignores this enormous force and attempts to handle everything with bonuses.

We have mostly overfulfilled the plans for the first two years of the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960). The realization of this year's plan will achieve the tasks suggested in the Central Committee's March resolution: to complete the main targets stipulated for 1960 in the Three-Year Plan this year, which is a great victory for the people and the Party of our country.

He said that the 1960 plan facing the people is more arduous than this year's plan, but these tasks are achievable. The Three-Year Plan stipulates that industry should grow by 22% compared with 1957. The actual increase in industrial production in 1958 was 12%, and this year will not be less than this number. If it only increases by 8% next year, then industrial production will also increase by 35% compared with 1957, which means that the development speed target stipulated in the Three-Year Plan will be overfulfilled by 50%.

Fock pointed out that the indicators announced in the Party Central Committee's instructions on the Second Five-Year Plan are realistic and guaranteed in terms of manpower and material resources. He emphasized that the Central Committee only stipulated the tasks that can be guaranteed to be achieved today in the instructions, and believes that it is not only possible, but also necessary to overfulfill these indicators. This will be another contribution of our people to defending peace and making the socialist social system win in the peaceful competition between the two world systems.

    福克·耶诺在匈牙利党代表大会上作报告
    新五年计划将奠定社会主义基础
    匈牙利第二个五年计划的主要任务是：奠定社会主义基础，加速社会主义建设。党中央的指示规定五年内工业生产提高百分之六十五到百分之七十，农业生产提高百分之三十到百分之三十二。工业劳动生产率提高百分之三十七到百分之四十。今后几年内将结束农业的社会主义改造工作。
    据新华社布达佩斯30日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记福克·耶诺，11月30日在党的第七次代表大会上就第二项议程作了关于国民经济第二个五年计划的报告。
    福克说，在党代表大会召开的两个月以前，党中央委员会公布的“解决经济任务和制订发展国民经济第二个五年计划的方针”的指示规定，在第二个五年计划
  （1961—1965年）时期内，我们的主要任务是：奠定社会主义的基础，加速社会主义建设。根据这个主要任务，我们将通过提高生产率和技术水平、改组国民经济结构、加强生产经济化、改变农业中的所有制，来提高工农业生产，并在这个基础上继续提高人民的生活水平。
    福克说，在决定我国社会主义建设任务时，我们是从我国国民经济的客观情况出发的，并且首先依靠国内的力量。我们根据我国国民经济的特点，多方面地运用苏联和人民民主国家在建设社会主义中所积累的丰富经验。我们应该既避免夸大民族特点，又避免机械地抄袭经验。
    福克指出，党中央关于第二个五年计划的指示提出了国民经济发展中的主要比例。指示规定必须提高工业生产65％到70％，提高农业生产30％到32％，并使国民收入至少增长50％。在发展重工业时，我们将根据自己最有利的天然条件和经济条件，来专门发展某些工业部门和生产某些产品。
    根据指示，增产的大部分必须通过劳动生产率的提高来实现。在这期间，工业劳动生产率将提高37％到40％，这就是说，生产的三分之二的增长额必须通过提高劳动生产率来予以保证。由于消费基金的增长，1965年职工和农民的实际收入就有可能比1958年提高26％到29％。
    福克说，我们认为，今后提高劳动生产率的主要途径仍然是：在更高的水平上继续执行三年计划中已开始执行的经济政策。为此，今后要充分考虑到经济的原则，研究技术水平的提高问题、工业结构的改组问题。
    他指出，五年计划期间，煤的生产将提高15％到20％，石油生产提高一倍，瓦斯生产提高两倍，电力生产将比1958年提高72％到75％以上。
    在机械工业中首先要发展仪器工业、通讯器材、强电流设备、化学工业机械以及食品工业机械的生产。要生产更多较复杂的、价值较高的各种专门的机床和柴油机车。在钢铁工业方面，首先应改善产品的质量，增加产品的品种，发展优质钢、精密钢板及冷轧钢的生产。各种冷轧钢材的生产能力将比1958年增长80％。
    他指出，根据五年计划的指示，要特别注意发展制铝工业的生产，化学工业生产要提高一倍。
    福克还谈到必须彻底更换轻工业、食品工业的机器设备和提高建筑工业和交通运输工业的技术水平。福克说，五年计划期间，国家投资的74％将直接服务于生产目的，生产投资的42％到43％将用于机器设备的投资。福克在谈到工业地理分布问题时说，我们将以更大的努力来加速首都以外地区的工业发展。
    福克强调指出，劳动群众在技术革新运动中的积极性是提高技术水平的重要因素之一，经济领导人应该认识到在革新创造中所体现的劳动人民的丰富经验和推动发展的伟大力量。
    他说：由苏联和欧洲其他社会主义国家组成的经济互助委员会成效卓著的工作、社会主义阵营各国逐渐扩大的经济合作，保证了我国国民经济的发展，便利于我们制订远景规划，促进科学研究工作，使我们有可能更可靠地制订计划。生产的专业化以及由此而产生的先进劳动组织，是提高技术水平的推动力量和先决条件。
    福克说，为了健康地继续发展国民经济，还应该大大提高农业生产。目前，在匈牙利约50％的耕地面积上进行着大规模的经营，在今后几年中，我们要在创造先进的大规模生产方面大大前进一步。根据中央关于经济任务和制订第二个五年计划的指示，到1965年，拖拉机的数目将增加为1958年的两倍半，化学肥料的施用量将增加两倍，灌溉面积将从目前的十五万霍尔特增加到三十六万霍尔特。
    福克还指出，社会主义农业部门要大力改进和发展养猪业和家庭饲养业。
    他说：我们要在政治上、经济上进一步发展和巩固现有的农业生产合作社。必须创造一切必要条件来说服个体农民，并与他们共同合作，在今后几年内结束农业的社会主义改造工作。
    福克说，继续提高领导水平是进一步发展国民经济和执行计划的主要要求之一。最近三年之所以取得这样的成绩还由于在领导经济方面比过去几年更加贯彻了民主集中制的原则。在发展国民经济方面几个具有决定意义的问题上，我们加强了中央领导，同时把无数事务的处理权划入下级经济部门的职权范围。今后我们还要继续这样做，并且要简化经济领导机构中不必要的层次，克服官僚主义的领导方法。
    他又说，物质利益原则比前几年得到更加正确的贯彻，这在很大程度上有助于这种发展。但是，我们反对那种认为只是依赖于物质鼓励才取得这些成就的见解。社会主义建设过程中有多次事例证实，具有社会主义必胜信念和社会主义觉悟的人们，为响应党的号召，在任务已经明确而一致地肯定下来的情况下，同样可以创造奇迹并从而能够给予广大劳动群众以莫大的鼓舞。如果有人忽视这种巨大的力量而企图以奖金办理一切事情，那将犯不可弥补的错误。
    我们已大部超额完成三年计划（1958—1960年）中的前两年的计划。今年的计划的实现，将达到党中央三月决议中所建议的任务：在今年内完成三年计划为1960年规定的主要指标，这是我国人民和党的伟大胜利。
    他说，摆在人民面前的1960年计划比今年计划的任务更为繁重，但是，这些任务是可以实现的。三年计划中规定工业要比1957年增长22％。1958年工业生产的实际增长量为12％，今年也将不会比这个数目小。假如明年只增加8％，那么工业生产也将比1957年增加35％，这就是说，将超额50％完成三年计划所规定的发展速度指标。
    福克指出，党中央关于第二个五年计划的指示中所公布的指标都是切合实际的，在人力物力方面都有保证。他强调说，中央委员会在指示中只把今天可以保证能够实现的任务规定下来，并认为不但有可能、而且有必要超额完成这些指标。这将是我国人民对保卫和平和在两个世界体系和平竞赛中使社会主义社会制度取得胜利的又一贡献。
