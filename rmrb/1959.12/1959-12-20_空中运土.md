    Aerial soil transportation is truly good,
    Soil baskets run along the steel wire,
    Like swallows flying all over the sky,
    Squeaking back and forth.
    The dam grows with the soil piles,
    Building a丈 (zhàng - a unit of length, approx. 3.3 meters) high in half a day,
    Damming the mountain pass and blocking the river,
    Generating electricity and irrigating, see you tomorrow.

    空中运土
    空中运土真正好，
    土筐顺着铁丝跑，
    好像燕子满天飞，
    一来一回吱吱叫。
    大坝随着土堆长，
    一晌就筑一丈高，
    闸住山口拦住河，
    发电灌溉看明朝。
