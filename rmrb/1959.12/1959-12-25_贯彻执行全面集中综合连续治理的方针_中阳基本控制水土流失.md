Implementing the Policy of Comprehensive, Concentrated, Integrated, and Continuous Governance
Zongyang Basically Controls Soil Erosion

(Our report) Shanxi Province's Zhongyang County, under the policy of focusing on basic farmland construction and implementing comprehensive, concentrated, integrated, and continuous governance, has recently completed 260,000 mu of terraced fields after 20 days of hard work, and comprehensively treated 370,000 mu of soil erosion area. Thus, all 360,000 mu of basic farmland in the county have been terraced, and all 1.82 million mu of soil erosion area have been treated, completing the national agricultural development outline's soil and water conservation task two years and ten months ahead of schedule.

Zongyang County is located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, in the Loess Plateau area, with more mountains than plains and severe soil erosion. Inspired by the Party Central Committee's call to "fundamentally control the Yellow River's flood disasters and develop the Yellow River's water conservancy," the county's people have made great achievements in mountain and water management over the years. However, due to insufficient basic farmland construction, only 100,000 mu of the county's 360,000 mu of basic farmland are flatlands and terraced fields. Encouraged by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the county, based on the principle of "centering on basic farmland construction with terraced fields as the main focus, implementing comprehensive, concentrated, integrated, and continuous governance," launched a mass movement for mountain and water management.

The most important feature of this winter's mountain and water management movement is that the leadership has a clear governance policy in mind. Changing the past piecemeal and fragmented governance into large-scale, comprehensive, integrated, and continuous governance. That is, within the total area of the county, for rocky areas, focus on building large-scale forest farms and pastures, planting trees and grasses; for loess hilly areas, focus on building terraced fields to achieve fruit and flower mountains in remote high mountains, and terraced fields on low and gentle slopes; for the Nanchuan River basin and 162 larger river basins that collect the county's water systems and large volumes of water, flowing directly into the Yellow River, achieve high-standard governance of planting trees and grasses on mountain tops, building terraced fields on mountain slopes, and enclosing fields with water networks on plains. In this way, not only is the threat of soil erosion controlled, but also the benefits of soil, water, grass, and trees in mountainous areas are greatly promoted. So far, in addition to building terraced fields averaging three mu per person, the county has also built 460,000 mu of timber forests, 110,000 mu of fruit and flower forests, and 290,000 mu of pasture bases, and planted another 52.2 million fruit and flower trees, laying the foundation for the development of diversified operations in mountainous areas.

　　贯彻执行全面集中综合连续治理的方针
    中阳基本控制水土流失
    本报讯　山西中阳县在以农田基本建设为中心，全面集中综合连续治理的方针下，最近经过二十天大干，已经完成水平梯田二十六万亩，综合治理水土流失面积三十七万亩。至此，全县三十六万亩基本农田全部实现了水平梯田化，一百八十二万亩水土流失面积已经全部得到治理，提前两年零十个月，胜利完成了全国农业发展纲要规定的水土保持任务。
    中阳县位于黄河中游，地属黄土丘陵，境内山多川少，水土流失严重。在党中央“根治黄河水患，开发黄河水利”号召鼓舞下，历年来，全县人民治山治水获得巨大成就。但是，由于农田基本建设做得不够，全县三十六万亩基本农田，才有十万亩平川地和梯田地。在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞下，全县根据“以水平梯田为主的农田基本建设为中心，全面、集中、综合、连续治理”方针，掀起了全民治山治水运动。
    今年冬季治山治水运动最主要的特征是领导思想上有了明确的治理方针。改过去零碎的、片断的治理为大规模的全面的、综合、连续治理。这就是在全县总面积内，对于土石地区，以建大型林场与牧场为中心，栽种树木和牧草；黄土丘陵地区，以建设水平梯田为主，实现远山高山花果山，低山缓坡水平田；对于汇总全县水系、水量凶猛，直逮黄河的南川河流域和一百六十二个较大河流流域，要实现山顶栽种树木和牧草，山地修水平梯田，平川水网围田的高标准治理。这样，既控制了水土流失之患，又大兴了山区水土草木之利。到目前为止，全县除建成水平梯田，每人平均三亩外，还建成了四十六万亩木材林，十一万亩花果林和二十九万亩牧草基地，另植花果树木五千二百万株，为发展山区多种经营奠定了基础。
