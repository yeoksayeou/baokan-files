Raising More Pigs with Fewer People
--Guangxingzhou Commune Simplifies and Reforms Pig-Raising Tools

With the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry, is it necessary for the number of feeding personnel to increase proportionally?

The Guangxingzhou Commune in Yueyang County, Hunan, proves with vivid facts that as long as the masses are mobilized to vigorously carry out technological reforms of pig-raising tools, a large number of laborers can be saved. Before the tool reform, the commune raised 8,474 pigs, averaging 8 pigs per person, and occupied 1,060 feeders; recently, the commune's pigs have increased to 17,395, averaging 26 pigs per person, because of the vigorous reform of pig-feeding tools, the number of feeders has been reduced to 679.

The Problem is Raised

The Guangxingzhou Commune has a relatively tight labor force, with each laborer responsible for cultivating an average of 20 mu of land. Before communization, the masses raised pigs by free-range feeding (keeping the pigs in the wild all day long), allowing them to find their own food, so raising pigs did not take up labor. After communization, the collective pig-raising industry developed rapidly, and the habit of raising pigs also changed completely, from free-range feeding to stall feeding. Collective pig raising has brought many benefits to the commune members: first, it accumulated more high-quality fertilizer, increasing grain production; second, it increased the income of the commune members, and the consumption of meat by the commune members also increased significantly. However, it also brought a new contradiction, that is, the labor required for collective pig raising increased greatly compared to the past.

How to solve it? If the number of feeders is increased, it will inevitably affect the production of grain and cotton. The result of the commune party committee's research is that the contradiction of tight labor can only be solved by reforming feeding tools, and fewer people must be used to raise more pigs.

Simplifying and Making Use of Local Resources, Self-Reliance

The commune party committee first guided the masses to start with the projects that occupy the most labor, such as cutting feed, using water, and transporting, to reform tools. Since May of this year, the commune has concentrated the wisdom of the masses, and designed, modified, and newly made six kinds of feed crushers.

Deng Guangyuan, the director of the commune's farm tool factory, and the iron and woodworking workers of the whole factory showed great enthusiasm in reforming pig-feeding tools. Deng Guangyuan used an old rice thresher, based on the principle of a Chinese medicine cutter, installed two willow-leaf knives for chopping feed on the left end of the rice thresher drum, and also equipped it with some parts, and finally successfully modified a dual-purpose machine for cutting feed and threshing rice. After the first feed cutter was successfully trial-produced, the secretary of the party committee and the comrades of the animal husbandry and aquatic products department held an on-site meeting, personally operating and explaining it to everyone. After full promotion, the cadres and feeders of each brigade actively used their brains, and successively invented and modified many new tools. Zhang Quanyin, the secretary of the general branch of the Puxing Brigade, and the iron and woodworking workers organized a five-person group for technological innovation of feeding tools, and successfully trial-produced the first "six-knife feed cutter" in the commune, which improved the work efficiency five times compared with manual feed cutting.

In the tool reform movement, the commune party committee clearly pointed out that the tool reform must follow the principles of "from native to foreign, combining native and foreign, using local materials, simplifying and making use of local resources, relying on the masses, and self-reliance," and the reformed tools should have the characteristics of "low cost, high efficiency, simple manufacturing, and easy promotion."

At present, the commune has promoted and used the following tools:

In terms of feed cutting: there are 33 dual-purpose feed cutting and rice threshing machines modified from rice threshers, 3 feed cutting machines modified from cotton gins, 85 drum-type feed cutting machines, as well as three-purpose machines for slicing, shredding, and cutting feed, six-knife feed cutting machines and 13 hand-cranked feed cutting machines, the work efficiency is 5 to 10 times higher than manual labor, and the cost is only 6 yuan for some, and the highest is 82 yuan.

In terms of transporting swill: the commune has used 66 rail-guided and trackless swill transport vehicles, one vehicle can hold 500 to 1,500 jin of pig swill, and one or two people can push it, the cost is only 20 to 30 yuan.

In terms of water use: all pig farms in the commune have installed 94 earthen water taps, each of which can draw 50 dan of water per hour, which improves the work efficiency more than two times compared with manual water carrying (distance of five zhang), and the cost is only 4 yuan.

In other aspects: the commune has also made more than 1,300 sets of pig pen disinfection sprayers, washing pen watering buckets, stirring swill sticks, and three-purpose brooms (washing pens, washing troughs, washing pigs).

Due to the full use of these advanced tools, all collective pig farms in the commune have saved more than 116,000 workdays from May of this year to the present in more than seven months, which has strongly supported agricultural production.

How to Solve the Problem of Raw Materials

In the process of manufacturing feeding tools, the first difficulty encountered was the lack of raw materials, and they solved it in this way:

1. Clean up the warehouse and make full use of accumulated old materials and raw materials that can be used later. The commune farm tool factory alone cleaned out 20 cubic meters of wood and more than 1,000 jin of scrap iron from the warehouse.

2. Purchase from local people. The commune's farm tool factory collected 20 cubic meters of scattered camphor wood from the homes of commune members. The commune's supply and marketing department also purchased more than 3,000 jin of scrap iron from commune members, which strongly supported the farm tool factory's new tool manufacturing work.

3. Regional and departmental cooperation to exchange what each has for what it needs. The seven brigades in the mountainous area of the commune supported 15 cubic meters of pine wood. The Liangting Brigade had iron but no steel for manufacturing tools, while the commune's industrial and transportation department had steel but lacked iron. Through cooperation, the Liangting Brigade took out 1,000 jin of iron in exchange for a part of steel.

4. Make full use of substitutes. In the case of the relative lack of iron and steel locally, the commune resolutely adopted substitutes whenever wood or other things could be used as substitutes when manufacturing various parts of the feed cutter. The feed cutter needs a belt to drive the rollers, and there is a lack of belts locally, so they use gauze belts instead. These gauze belts are woven by the masses with local native yarn, which is very similar to canvas belts and has a good effect.

5. Save raw materials. The drum-type feed cutter initially manufactured by the commune had a longer wooden frame and a higher frame body. Everyone tried to reduce the length and height and adjusted the heavy specifications, so that each feed cutter could save 20 jin of pig iron and a part of wood. The carpenters of the commune also proposed methods to save raw materials such as "making the most of small materials, using every inch of material, making use of waste materials, and changing axes to saws."

Huge Harvest

Now, no matter which brigade or production team's pig farm, there has been an increase in pigs and a decrease in the number of pig feeders. The changes in pigs and labor before and after the tool reform in the pig farms of each production team of Guangxing Brigade are very obvious. After using advanced tools such as feed cutters, earthen water pumps for water diversion, and swill transport vehicles, the number of live pigs in each pig farm in the brigade increased from 1,280 to 1,962, while the number of feeders decreased from 160 to 120. Among them, the labor for cutting feed was reduced from 75 to 42, the labor for carrying water was reduced from 32 to 11, and the labor for cooking swill, transporting swill, and feeding swill was reduced from 28 to 24.

In the feed room of the commune's pig farm, the reporter saw the tense and pleasant labor scene of the feeders: a middle-aged woman sat in the middle of two drum-type crushers, stuffing handfuls of sweet potato vines, cabbage and other feeds into the hopper with both hands, and the already chopped feed fell down from the two funnels, and piles of chopped feed piled up on the ground in a short time. This earthen machine does not require manual pushing at all, but is powered by a cow-powered rotary machine. Wooden rails were laid on the road from the feed cooking house to each pig house. After the pig swill was cooked, the feeder opened the movable gate of the swill cooking pot and let the pig swill flow into the swill truck. Each truck can hold four or five hundred jin of pig swill, and two young women pushed it away very easily. When the feed was pushed to the side of the pig pen, they only needed to lift the live gate on the truck, and the swill flowed into the trough, without anyone needing to scoop it out with a spoon. There are also earthen water pumps installed with bamboo tubes in the pig farm. The water is drawn up from the bamboo tubes and can flow into the swill cooking pot or into the pig house. There are earthen water pipes made of bamboo beside each pig pen in the pig house. Whenever you want to wash the pig pen, pull out the wooden plug and the water will flow out.

    用少量的人养更多的猪
    ——广兴洲公社因陋就简改革养猪工具
    养猪事业高速度发展，饲养人员是不是一定要按正比例增长？
    湖南岳阳县广兴洲公社用活生生的事实证明，只要发动群众，对猪饲养工具大力进行技术改革，就可以节省大批的劳动力。工具改革之前，这个公社养猪八千四百七十四头，平均每人养猪八头，占用饲养员一千零六十名；最近全社的猪已经增加到一万七千三百九十五头，平均每人养猪二十六头，因为大搞喂猪工具改革，饲养员减少到六百七十九名。
    问题的提出
    广兴洲公社的劳力比较紧张，平均每个劳动力要负担二十亩地的耕种任务。公社化以前，群众养猪是敞放敞养（把猪整天放在野地里），任其自找食料，所以养猪并不占用劳力。公社化以后，集体养猪事业发展得很快，养猪的习惯也彻底改变了，由敞放敞养改变为存栏喂养。集体养猪给公社社员带来了许多好处：一是积了更多的优质肥料，增加了粮食产量；二是增加了社员收入，社员吃肉也显著增多了。但是也带来了一个新的矛盾，这就是集体养猪所需要的劳动力比过去大大增多了。
    如何解决呢？如果增加饲养人员，必然要影响粮食、棉花的生产。公社党委研究的结果是，解决劳力紧张的矛盾只有从饲养工具的改革方面着手，要用少量的人养更多的猪。
    因陋就简　自力更生
    公社党委首先引导群众从占用劳动力最多的切料、用水、运输等项目入手，改革工具。从今年5月份以来，公社集中群众智慧，设计、改装、新制的碎料机就有六种。
    公社农具厂厂长邓光远和全厂铁木工人在改革喂猪工具上表现了很大的热情。邓光远利用旧打稻机、根据铡药材机的原理，在打稻机滚筒的左端安装了两把用来铡饲料的柳叶刀，还配上了一些零件，终于改装成功了切料、打稻两用机。第一台切料机试制成功后，党委书记和畜牧水产部门的同志召开了现场会，亲自操作和讲解给大家听。全面推广以后，各个大队的干部和饲养人员都积极开动脑筋，陆续发明改装了很多新式工具。普兴大队总支书记章权银和铁木工人组织了一个饲养工具技术革新五人小组，试制成功了全社的第一部“六刀切料机”，比人工切料提高工效五倍。
    在改革工具运动中，公社党委明确地指出了工具改革必须遵循“从土到洋、土洋结合，就地取材、因陋就简，依靠群众、自立更生”的原则，改革的工具都应该具有“花钱少、工效高、制造简单、推广容易”的特点。
    目前，这个公社已经推广使用了如下一些工具：
    在切料方面：有由打稻机改装的切料、打稻两用机三十三部，利用弹花机改装的切料机三部，滚筒式切料机八十五部，还有切片、刨丝、切料三用机、六刀切料机和手摇切料机十三部，工效比人工提高五倍至十倍，成本有的只花六元，最高的是八十二元。
    在运潲方面：全社已经使用的有轨运潲车和无轨运潲车六十六部，一个车可以装五百到一千五百斤猪潲，一两个人就可以推动，成本只二三十元。
    在用水方面：全社各猪场已经安装了土自来水九十四处，每处每小时可抽水五十担，比人工担水（距离五丈远）提高工效二倍以上。只花四元成本就行了。
    其他方面：全社还做了猪栏消毒喷雾器，洗栏浇水桶，搅潲棍，三用扫帚（洗栏、洗槽、洗猪）等工具共一千三百多套。
    由于充分运用了这些先进工具，全社各集体养猪场从今年5月到目前为止的七个多月时间内，共节省了劳动日十一万六千多个，有力地支援了农业生产。
    原材料怎样解决
    饲养工具制造过程中，首先碰到原材料缺乏的困难，他们是这样解决的：
    一、清理仓库，充分利用积存旧料和暂时可缓用的原材料。仅公社农具厂就从仓库里清理出木材二十立方米，废铁一千多斤。
    二、向本地群众收购。公社农具厂收集的社员家里的零星樟木就有二十立方米。公社的供销部门也向社员收购了废铁三千多斤，有力地支援了农具厂的新工具制造工作。
    三、地区、部门协作，互通有无。这个公社在山区的七个大队就支援了松木十五立方米。凉亭大队制造工具有铁没有钢，公社工业交通部门有钢缺少铁，通过协作，凉亭大队拿出一千斤铁换回了一部分钢。
    四、充分利用代用品。在本地钢铁比较缺乏的情况下，这个公社在制造切料机的各个部件的时候，凡属能用木头或其他东西代用的就坚决采用代用品。切料机要用皮带带动滚轮，本地皮带缺少，他们就用纱带代替。这些纱带都是群众用本地出产的土纱织成的，很像帆布带，效果很好。
    五、节约原材料。这个公社最初制造的滚筒式切料机，木架较长，架身较高，大家想方设法压缩了长度和高度，调整了笨重规格以后，每部切料机能节约生铁二十斤和一部分木材。全社的木工还提出了“小材大用、寸料寸用、废物利用、改斧为锯”等节约原材料的办法。
    巨大的收获
    现在不管在哪一个大队或生产队的养猪场，都出现了增猪又减少了喂猪人的情况。广兴大队各生产队的养猪场，在工具改革前后，猪和劳力的变化非常明显。全大队各个猪场在运用了切料机、土抽水机引水、运潲车运潲等先进工具以后，生猪由一千二百八十头增加到一千九百六十二头，饲养人员却由一百六十个减少到一百二十个。其中切料的劳力由七十五人减少到四十二人，挑水由三十二人减少到十一人，煮潲、运潲和喂潲的由二十八人减少到二十四人。
    在公社养猪场的饲料间里，记者看到了饲养员们紧张而愉快的劳动情景：一个中年妇女坐在两部滚筒式碎料机中间，用双手往车斗里塞上成把薯藤、白菜等饲料，已经切碎了的饲料就从两个漏斗里往下掉，不一会地上就堆起一堆又一堆的碎饲料。这部土机器根本不要人力推动，是用牛力推动转盘机作动力的。在煮饲料的房子通到各栋猪舍的道路上，都铺了木轨道，猪潲煮好以后，饲养员把煮潲锅的活动闸门抽开，让猪潲流到潲车里，每部可装猪潲四、五百斤，两个青年妇女很轻快地就把它推走了。饲料推到猪栏边，她们只要把车上的活闸往上一提，潲就流进了槽里，根本不需要人一瓢瓢的舀了。猪场里还有用竹筒安装的土抽水机，水由竹筒里抽上来，可以流进煮潲锅里，也可以流到猪舍里去，猪舍的每个猪栏边都有用竹子做的土自来水管，什么时候要洗猪栏，拔开木塞，水就流出来。
