    Hazel Grouse
    The hazel grouse, a member of the grouse family, is famous in Changbai Mountain. In China, hazel grouse are only found in the mountainous regions of Jilin and Heilongjiang. They are quite numerous in Changbai Mountain and can be seen throughout the year, especially easily in spring and summer.
    An adult hazel grouse is about forty centimeters long and weighs up to half a kilogram. Its body is brownish-gray and very beautiful. It lives in forests, and mates and reproduces in March and April each year, nesting on the ground. It lays eggs in April and May, with seven to ten eggs in each nest. The incubation period is about twenty days, and the chicks hatch in June.
    Hazel grouse fly very fast, able to fly straight, but they don't go far before landing. They are accustomed to hiding in trees and are also good at walking on the ground. In winter, they form small groups and often wander downstream after snowfall. They mostly live in small bushes and, when the snow is deep, can create tunnels under the snow to spend the night. People often hunt them in winter.
    Hazel grouse meat is extremely tender and is the most delicious wild game. Hazel grouse can also be domesticated for artificial breeding and could be exported in large quantities in the future.

    榛鸡
    长白山有名的榛鸡，属于松鸡科。榛鸡在我国只产在吉林和黑龙江的山区。在长白山数量相当多，全年都能见到，尤以春夏季为易见。
    榛鸡成鸟约长四十厘米，大的有一斤重，身体是棕灰色，很美丽。它生活在森林中，每年3、4月间配对生殖，在地上作巢，4、5月产卵，每窝有七到十枚。孵化期约二十天，6月就孵出幼鶵。
    榛鸡飞行很快，能直飞，但不远就落下。它惯于在树上藏身，又善在地上行走。冬季成小群，降雪后往往向山下游荡；多生活在小丛林中，有时雪深时，能在雪下作通道过夜。人们多在冬季猎取它。
    榛鸡肉极鲜嫩，是最美好的野味。榛鸡也可以作为驯化人工繁殖的对象，将来可以大量出口。
