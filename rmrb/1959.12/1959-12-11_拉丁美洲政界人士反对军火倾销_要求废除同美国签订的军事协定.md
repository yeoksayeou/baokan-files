Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Recently, political figures in Latin American countries have fiercely opposed turning Latin America into a dumping ground for arms, and have demanded the abolition of military agreements signed with the United States in order to break free from U.S. military constraints and seek national independence and economic development.

According to TASS, Chilean President Alessandri recently stated in an interview with a reporter from the American "New York Times" that he opposes an arms race in Latin America. He said that the arms race prevents Latin American countries from using existing funds to develop their economies, "billions of dollars from Latin American countries are spent on markets selling outdated arms." Alessandri said, "Latin America should not become a market for dumping arms."

Alessandri's remarks were made when progressive and democratic individuals in Chile were launching a widespread movement to reduce armaments and military spending. The Chilean Communist Party's Political Committee published a statement in "El Siglo" supporting the Chilean president's remarks. The statement said that, in fact, the military treaties promoted by the United States and the military spending of certain militarist governments have become a heavy burden on the people of Latin America. In Chile's budget, annual military spending amounts to more than one hundred billion pesos. The statement supports the government's proposal that Latin American countries reach an agreement on balancing defense expenditures, and believes that the agreement should be reached by the Latin American countries themselves, rather than through the Organization of American States, because the American groups, who are interested in launching an arms race among these countries, have obvious influence in this organization. The participation of the United States in the discussion will only lead to interference in this admirable initiative.

Responding to Alessandri's proposal, Peruvian President Manuel Prado wrote to Chilean President Alessandri on November 27, suggesting that a conference of Latin American governments be held in the capital of Chile or Peru to discuss the issue of disarmament in the Latin American region.

According to the Brazilian newspaper "Ultima Hora," prominent Brazilian politician Tancredo Neves recently also emphasized the need for Latin American countries to implement disarmament. Many members of the Brazilian parliament have suggested amending or canceling the military agreements signed with the United States.

### 拉丁美洲政界人士反对军火倾销  要求废除同美国签订的军事协定

    拉丁美洲政界人士反对军火倾销
    要求废除同美国签订的军事协定
    本报综合报道　最近拉丁美洲各国政界人士激烈反对把拉丁美洲变为倾销军火的市场，并要求废除同美国签订的军事协定，以摆脱美国的军事束缚，求得民族独立和经济发展。
    据塔斯社报道，智利总统亚历山德里最近对美国“纽约时报”记者发表谈话，表示反对在拉丁美洲进行军备竞赛。他说，军备竞赛妨碍拉丁美洲各国利用现有资金来发展经济，“拉丁美洲国家的亿万美元都耗费在销售过时的军火的市场上”。亚历山德里说，“拉丁美洲不应当成为倾销军火的市场”。
    亚历山德里的这番谈话，是在智利的进步和民主人士正展开争取裁减军备和削减军费的广泛运动时发表的。智利共产党政治委员会在“世纪报”上发表声明，支持智利总统的谈话。声明说，实际上，美国推行的军事条约及某些军国主义政府的军费开支已成为拉丁美洲人民沉重的负担。在智利的预算中，每年的军费开支达一千多亿比索。声明支持政府准备提出的拉丁美洲各国就平衡国防支出的问题达成协议的建议，并且认为，不应该通过美洲国家组织而应由拉丁美洲国家自己来达成协议，因为对在这些国家之间展开军备竞赛感到兴趣的美国集团在这个组织中有着明显的势力。美国参加讨论的结果，只会导致对这个值得赞扬的创议的干涉。
    秘鲁总统曼努埃尔·普腊多响应亚历山德里的主张，在11月27日写信给智利总统亚历山德里，建议在智利或秘鲁首都召开一次拉丁美洲各国政府讨论拉丁美洲地区裁军问题的会议。
    据巴西“最后一点钟报”报道，巴西著名政治家坦特斯最近也强调拉丁美洲国家实行裁军的必要性。巴西有许多议员建议修改或取消和美国签订的军事协定。
