Laying a Solid Foundation for Next Year's Summer Harvest
--Summary of Jiangsu Xinhua Daily Editorial

Jiangsu Xinhua Daily published an editorial on December 8th titled "A Great Revolution in Winter Field Management." The following is a summary:

Strengthening the field management of overwintering crops is one of the important tasks of winter and spring production. Only by managing overwintering crops well can we achieve a bumper harvest of summer crops next year and lay the foundation for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production for the whole year.

Judging from the overall situation in Jiangsu, the situation of field management of overwintering crops is good. But this does not mean that everyone has a sufficient understanding of the importance of strengthening field management of overwintering crops. Some people still act according to the old habit of "not managing in winter, managing after the beginning of the year." They believe that "there is no need to manage the fields in winter, and there is nothing good to manage," or that "there are too many winter production tasks, and field management cannot be managed even if you want to." These arguments are actually a reflection of backward small-peasant thinking and a manifestation of insufficient understanding of the new situation after the people's commune.

In the era of small-peasant economy, due to scattered production by individual households with weak strength, they could only be busy with the present and could not take care of the future. At that time, every year after the autumn harvest and autumn planting ended, half of the winter had already passed, and there was no strength to grasp winter production. Not only were there no conditions to build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, improve the soil, plant trees, etc., even the field management of a single summer crop could not be managed well.

The current agricultural production situation is indeed greatly changed. After the people's commune, a large amount of labor potential has been tapped, coupled with unified planning and comprehensive arrangements, which makes it possible to take care of all aspects of winter production. At the same time, we must also see that winter production projects are not isolated; they can promote and facilitate each other. Taking the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy as an example, it is both a winter repair content and can be said to be a field management content. In this year's autumn planting, Jiangsu has combined the leveling of some land to reorganize a part of the drainage and irrigation system, which can promote the irrigation of more than 10 million mu of wheat fields to achieve garden-like irrigation. Furthermore, with regard to developing diversified operations, after various places actively develop pig raising, they can ensure that overwintering crops have more and better topdressing fertilizer. It can be seen from this that as long as we recognize the new situation and favorable conditions after communization, recognize the internal links between various winter production projects, and adopt the method of unified leadership by the Party committee, comprehensive planning, and division of labor, we can not only grasp winter field management well, but also grasp other production and construction projects equally well.

To do a good job in winter field management, in addition to a great revolution in thinking, there must also be a great revolution in technical measures. First of all, several necessary, practical, and specific yield-increasing measures should be stipulated in the technical measures, specific quotas for various winter field management measures should be formulated, and they should be included in the "three guarantees" plan; otherwise, winter field management will be just empty talk.

The freezing season is approaching, and now is the key period to strengthen the seedling management of overwintering crops. Party committees at all levels must immediately take effective measures to thoroughly check the situation of field management: check indicators, check measures, check quotas, check contract work, check the responsibility system, and check labor arrangements. Through inspection, we should conscientiously summarize and promote advanced experience, discover problems, and solve problems.

### 为明年夏季丰收打好基础——江苏新华日报社论摘要

    为明年夏季丰收打好基础
    ——江苏新华日报社论摘要
    江苏新华日报12月8日以“冬季田间管理来个大革命”为题发表社论。摘要如下：
    加强越冬作物田间管理，是冬春生产重要任务之一。只有把越冬作物管好，才能实现明年夏熟作物的大丰收，才能为明年全年农业生产更好更全面跃进打下基础。
    从江苏当前总的情况来看，越冬作物田间管理的情况是好的。但这并不是说，所有的人都对加强越冬作物田间管理的重要性有了足够的认识。有些人仍然按照“冬季不管，开年再管”的老习惯办事，他们认为“冬季田间不用管，要管也没有什么好管”，或者认为“冬季生产内容太多，田间管理要管也管不上”。这些论调，实际上是落后的小农思想的反映，是对人民公社化以后的新形势认识不足的表现。
    在小农经济时代，由于单家独户分散生产，力量单薄，只能忙眼前，不能顾将来。那时，每年等秋收秋种结束，冬季就已经过去了一半，根本没有力量去抓冬季生产，非但没有条件去修水利、积肥、改良土壤、植树造林等等，就连单一的夏熟作物的田间管理也无法管好。
    现在的农业生产形势，毕竟是大变了。人民公社化以后，挖掘了大量的劳动潜力，加上统一规划、全面安排，这就有可能照顾冬季生产的各个方面。同时，我们还要看到，冬季生产项目并不是孤立的，它们之间可以互相推动、互相促进。以兴修小型农田水利来说，既是冬修的内容，又可以说是田间管理的内容。今年秋种中，江苏各地结合平整一部分土地，整理了一部分排灌系统，就可以促使一千多万亩麦田实现灌溉园田化。再以开展多种经营来说，各地积极发展养猪后，就能保证越冬作物有更多更好的追肥。由此可见，只要认清公社化以后的新形势和有利条件，认清冬季生产各个项目之间的内在联系，采取党委统一领导、全面规划、分线作战的方法，不但可以把冬季田间管理抓好，其他各个生产建设项目都同样能够抓好。
    要搞好冬季田间管理，除了要在思想上来一个大革命，还必须在技术措施上来一个大革命。首先应该在技术措施上规定若干必要的、切实的、具体的增产措施，订出冬季田间管理各项措施的具体定额，并把它们列入三包方案；否则冬季田间管理就等于空谈。
    封冻季节就要到了，现在正是加强越冬作物苗期管理的关键时期，各级党委要立即采取得力措施，彻底检查一下田间管理的情况：查指标、查措施、查定额、查包工、查责任制、查劳力安排，通过检查，认真总结推广先进经验，发现问题，解决问题。
