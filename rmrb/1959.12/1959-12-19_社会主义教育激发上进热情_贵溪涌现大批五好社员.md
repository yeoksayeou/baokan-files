    Socialist Education Inspires Enthusiasm for Progress
    A Large Number of "Five-Good" Commune Members Emerge in Guixi
    (Reported by this newspaper) Since Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, deeply launched the socialist education movement in the countryside, the ideological awareness of the vast commune members has been further enhanced, and thousands of "Five-Good" commune members have emerged, who are good in production, good in loving the commune, good in unity, good in loving cadres, and good in loving the country, as well as more than a thousand advanced communes, advanced production teams, and model collectives. At present, winter production is vigorously carried out throughout the county. More than 140,000 commune members are engaged in red flag competitions on water conservancy construction sites, and more than 40,000 commune members are engaged in field management competitions to compare who applies more fertilizer, weeds more thoroughly, and manages better. In addition, more than 60,000 commune members are climbing mountains and wading through rivers to accumulate high-quality fertilizer for next year's early rice. Since November, the labor attendance rate in each commune has reached more than 98%, and production efficiency has increased by an average of 20% compared with the past.
    In the socialist education movement, the vast commune members personally felt the unparalleled superiority of the commune through recollection and comparison, and loved the commune even more. In the past, some farm tools in the Dipin Brigade of the Zhiguang Commune were left unattended in the fields, and cattle often spent the night outdoors. After the socialist education was carried out, in the past two months, the commune members have cherished the team's farm tools even more, and the feeders have stayed with the cattle during the day and accompanied them at night. In November, 5,000 commune members were selected as "good in loving the commune" in this commune, accounting for 25% of the total number of male and female commune members.
    Another new atmosphere brought about by the socialist education movement is that commune members help each other and are closely united. Commune members Lai Guangxi and Chen Faliang from the Lingshang Brigade of the Xionshi Commune had disagreements in the past and were not united. Socialist education improved their ideological awareness, eliminated prejudices. Lai Guangxi helped Chen Faliang learn the technology of cultivating rapeseed, and Chen Faliang helped Lai Guangxi learn the technology of managing wheat. They taught and learned from each other, and united as one. As a result, both of them were rated as models in winter field management. The Zhoufang Commune in the mountainous area has a large land area but a small population. This winter, it plans to build a large reservoir, but it has been unable to start construction on a large scale for a long time. After learning about this situation, eight brother communes, including Wenfang, Zhangping, Yu'jia, and Heping, immediately took the initiative to cooperate with the Zhoufang Commune and sent more than 8,000 laborers to support the Zhoufang Commune in building the reservoir. As soon as the migrant workers arrived at the construction site, they tried every means to improve work efficiency and engineering quality as if they were building their own commune's reservoir. Now, with the help of brother communes, the Zhoufang Commune has completed 60% of the planned water conservancy project and is expected to be completed ahead of schedule by the end of December.
    After socialist education, the vast commune members of Guixi County love the cadres even more, and the relationship between the cadres and the masses is even closer. The captain of the Tangbian Brigade of the Zhiguang Commune was transferred from the Jiangjia Brigade. When he first arrived there, some commune members said, "The cadres of the Jiangjia Team cannot lead our Tangbian Team." They did not listen to the captain's instructions in production. After socialist education, these commune members corrected their understanding and changed their attitude, and everyone obeyed the captain's command. Because of the close connection between cadres and the masses, their energy was high and they had many methods, and the winter production of the Tangbian Team was very good, ranking among the best in the commune.
    Socialist education has also inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the vast commune members. After carrying out socialist education, the commune members of the Xionshi Commune selected the best grain to send for grain requisition and sell surplus grain, and overfulfilled the commune's grain purchase task within two days. Because the vast commune members have high patriotic enthusiasm, the county completed the grain requisition task in ten days this year, two months earlier than in previous years, and the grain quality was very good.

### 社会主义教育激发上进热情  贵溪涌现大批五好社员

    社会主义教育激发上进热情
    贵溪涌现大批五好社员
    本报讯　江西省贵溪县在农村中深入开展社会主义教育运动以后，广大社员的思想觉悟进一步提高，涌现出成千上万名生产好、爱社好、团结好、爱护干部好、爱国好的“五好”社员，以及一千多个上游社、先进生产队和模范集体。目前，全县冬季生产蓬勃开展，有十四万多名社员在水利工地上开展了红旗竞赛，四万多名社员开展了比追肥多、除草净、管理好的田间管理竞赛，另有六万多名社员登山涉水为明年早稻积造优质肥料。11月份以来，各公社的劳动出勤率都达到98％以上，生产效率平均比过去提高了20％。
    广大社员在社会主义教育运动中通过回忆对比，亲身感受到了公社的无比优越性，更加热爱公社。志光公社低平大队过去有些农具放在野外无人管，耕牛经常夜里在野外露宿。开展社会主义教育以后，两个月来，社员都更加爱护队里的农具，饲养员白天不离牛，晚间伴牛宿。11月份，这个社评选出来的“爱社好”的社员就有五千名，占全社男女社员的25％。
    社会主义教育运动带来的另一个新气象，是社员们相互帮助，亲密团结。雄石公社岭上大队社员赖光喜和陈发亮，因为过去闹过意见，互不团结。社会主义教育提高了他们的思想觉悟，消除了成见，赖光喜帮助陈发亮学习培育油菜的技术，陈发亮帮助赖光喜学习管理小麦的技术，互教互学，团结一心，结果两个人都被评为冬季田间管理的模范。山区周坊公社地多人少，今冬计划兴建一座大型水库，迟迟不能大规模动工。文坊、樟坪、余家、和平等八个兄弟公社，知道这一情况后，立即主动和周坊公社协作，派出八千多个劳动力支援周坊公社兴建水库。民工们一到工地，就像兴建自己社里的水库一样，千方百计提高工效，提高工程质量。现在，在兄弟公社的帮助下，周坊公社已完成这座水利工程计划的60％，预计12月底将提前建成。
    经过社会主义教育，贵溪县广大社员更加热爱干部，干部和群众的关系更加密切了。志光公社塘边大队的队长是从江家大队调来的。刚到那里时，有些社员说：“江家队的干部，不能领导我们塘边队。”他们在生产中不听从队长的指挥。经过社会主义教育，这些社员端正了认识，改变了态度，个个服从队长指挥。由于干部群众联系密切，干劲足，办法多，塘边队冬季生产搞得很好。在全社名列前茅。
    社会主义教育，也激发了广大社员的爱国热情。雄石公社在开展社会主义教育后，社员们选出最好的粮食送征粮、卖余粮，两天内超额完成了全社征购粮任务。由于广大社员爱国热情高，全县今年在十天中，就完成了征购粮任务，比往年提早两个月，而且粮食质量很好。
