Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 27th -- Our correspondent Tian Zhuang reports: The builders of the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub Project victoriously completed the great historical task of cutting off the Han River at 1:00 PM on the 26th. The torrent rushing down from the upstream canyon flowed for the first time through the diversion bottom holes of the right bank dam, which people had arranged. The days when the Han River, which had been difficult to tame for thousands of years, would benefit the people had begun.

On the morning of the 26th, both banks of the Han River at Danjiangkou were completely shrouded in an atmosphere of battle. At 8:20 AM, with a cannon blast at the head of the right bank diversion canal, the Han River split into a torrent, flowing straight towards the diversion bottom holes of the dam. At 9:50 AM, self-dumping trucks carrying stone and precast concrete blocks raced one after another to the left end of the closure gap. In less than a minute, a truckload of ten or twenty-five tons of stone and precast concrete blocks was dumped into the rapid current of the Han River. At the right end and upstream of the closure gap, the builders also waged a fierce battle against the rapids. They threw the prepared bamboo cages and rubble one after another into the water. After three hours and ten minutes of fierce fighting, the twenty-two-meter-wide closure gap was finally closed.

The Danjiangkou Hub Project is the key project for fundamentally controlling and comprehensively developing the Han River and is one of the largest water conservancy projects in China today. Since construction began in September last year, nearly sixteen months of effort by a construction army of 100,000 from seventeen counties in Hubei and Henan provinces has achieved the victory of the river closure.

Currently, the Danjiangkou Hub Project has entered a new stage of comprehensive pouring of the left bank cofferdam and the dam. The builders are striving to build the left bank cofferdam to an elevation of about 125 meters before the arrival of the Han River flood season (June). In this way, the Danjiangkou project can detain 2.6 billion cubic meters of water next year, which will not only reduce the Han River flood peak but also reduce the burden of flood prevention for the people on both banks of the middle and lower reaches.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 27th -- The builders of the Han River Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub Project held a celebration meeting at the construction site on the 26th to celebrate the cutting off of the Han River.

Li Xiannian, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Secretary of the Secretariat, and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke at the celebration meeting. He said that the completion of the first phase of the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub Project and the successful river closure were victories for the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and a series of policies of walking on two legs; it was the result of the selfless labor of the 100,000 workers at the construction site, under the leadership of the Party, with the strong support of the people throughout the country, and with the kind assistance of Soviet experts. He first extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to all the workers at the Danjiangkou construction site and expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the experts.

He went on to say that the Danjiangkou Project is one of the large-scale water conservancy projects currently underway in China. In the early stages of construction, there was a lack of modern construction machinery and transportation, and there were many difficulties. From the beginning of the project, it encountered resistance from right-leaning opportunists, who believed that without various favorable conditions, without mechanization and modern tools, starting with indigenous methods was bound to fail.

However, our view is not like this. We believe that there are difficulties, but the road is always made by people. With the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the broad masses of the working people as our reliance, difficulties can be overcome. The labor army at the Danjiangkou construction site resolutely refuted the right-leaning opportunists with their own practical actions, proving that the Party's line and policies are completely correct. In the past year, relying on the method of "mainly indigenous, combining indigenous and foreign," they completed more than 9.2 million cubic meters of earth, sand, and stone, poured more than 410,000 cubic meters of concrete, and successfully completed the first phase of the cofferdam project; in the arduous and complex struggle, they also trained a technical workforce of more than 10,000 people of various types, who not only have a certain level of technical skill but also have a high level of political awareness and strong organization and discipline; in terms of living conditions, thanks to everyone's efforts and self-reliance, they are now able to supply 75% of their own vegetables and most of their own meat, and the housing problem has also been solved. In the past year, we have achieved one victory after another, and today's closure further illustrates this series of victories.

Li Xiannian said: The victory of the first phase of the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub Project and the river closure is of great significance for the development of our water conservancy construction cause. It further proves from the water conservancy aspect the correctness of an important basic point of the Party's General Line – the simultaneous development of foreign and indigenous methods of production – proving that we can use the method of "starting with indigenous methods, first indigenous then foreign, combining indigenous and foreign, from indigenous to foreign" to build large-scale water conservancy projects, that is to say, we can develop water conservancy construction at a higher speed. In the construction process of the first phase of the project, the Danjiangkou construction site provided some important construction experiences, such as the method of "using earth to control water, combining earth, sand, and stone for cofferdams," which is still an innovation in large-scale water conservancy projects. We should seriously summarize and give full attention to such experiences.

Li Xiannian finally said: The Han River closure is of decisive significance for ensuring the early completion of the entire project. However, the amount of work that has been completed is still only a part compared to the total amount of work, and a large amount of work is still to come. The project has now entered the comprehensive construction stage, so we must redouble our efforts and must complete the future projects with the fastest speed, the best quality, and the most frugal methods. He pointed out that, without a doubt, there will still be many difficulties, and in the face of new difficulties, right-leaning conservative thinking may still appear, and the struggle between the two ideologies and the two lines will continue. He called on all the workers at the construction site to, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, closely rely on the leadership of the Party, hold high the red flag of the General Line, adhere to putting politics in command, oppose right-leaning thinking, boost morale, and launch a mass movement to advance our cause from victory to greater victory.

Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Party Committee of the Han River Danjiangkou Construction Site, also spoke. He said: Our project has entered a new stage, and the people's Han River has entered a new era. This is the result of our following the Party's General Line and overcoming the many difficulties in construction for one year and four months. In the future, we must guard against arrogance and rashness, establish lofty ambitions, and advance victoriously.

Qi Wenjian, Vice Governor of Henan Province, Li Erzhong, Standing Committee Member of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, Lin Yishan, Director of the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office, and Bakseyev, Leader of the Soviet Expert Group of the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office, also spoke at the meeting, congratulating the victory of the high-speed construction of the Danjiangkou Project. Finally, the meeting read out the congratulatory message from the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power. (Attached picture)

　　丹江口水利枢纽工程胜利合龙
    腰斩汉水　为民造福
    李先念副总理在庆祝大会上勉励职工用最快的速度、最好的质量、最勤俭的办法来完成今后的工程
    据新华社武汉27日电　本社记者田庄报道：丹江口水利枢纽工程的建设者们，已在26日下午一时正，胜利地完成了腰斩汉水的伟大历史任务。从上游峡谷奔腾而下的洪流第一次从人们安排好的右岸大坝导流底孔流去，千年难驯的汉水为人民造福的日子开始了。
    26日早晨，丹江口汉水两岸就完全笼罩在战斗的气氛里。八时二十分，右岸引水渠首一声炮响，汉水分出一股巨流，直流向大坝导流底孔。九时五十分，载着石料和混凝土预制块的自卸大卡车，一辆挨一辆地飞驰到龙口的左端，不到一分钟，就有一车十吨或二十五吨的石料和混凝土预制块，倾泻到湍急的汉水急流里。龙口的右端和上游，建设者们也同激流展开了激烈的斗争。他们把事先准备好的竹笼、块石，一个又一个的抛向水底。经过三小时零十分的激战，二十二米宽的龙口终于合龙了。
    丹江口枢纽工程是根治和综合开发汉水的关键工程，是我国目前最大的水利工程之一。从去年9月开工以来，经过来自湖北、河南两省十七个县十万建设大军近十六个月的努力，就取得了截流的胜利。
    目前，丹江口枢纽工程进入左岸围堰和大坝全面浇筑的新阶段。建设者们争取汉水大汛（6月）到来以前，把左岸围堰筑到一百二十五米左右的高程。这样，丹江口工程就可以在明年滞洪二十六亿方水，不仅能够削减汉水洪峰，还可使中、下游两岸人民减轻防汛负担。
    新华社武汉27日电　汉水丹江口水利枢纽工程的建设者们，26日在工地举行了斩断汉水的庆祝大会。
    中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记、国务院副总理李先念在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，丹江口水利枢纽工程第一期工程的完成和胜利截流，是党的社会主义建设总路线和一系列两条腿走路的方针的胜利；是工地十万职工，在党的领导下，在全国各地人民大力支援以及苏联专家的亲切帮助下，以冲天的干劲，进行了忘我劳动的结果。他首先代表中共中央和国务院，向丹江口工地的全体职工表示热烈的祝贺；向各位专家表示衷心的感谢。
    他接着说，丹江口工程是我国目前大型水利工程之一。在施工初期，现代化的施工机械和交通运输工具又很缺乏，困难是不少的。工程一开始，便碰到右倾机会主义分子的抵抗，他们认为没有各种优裕条件，没有机械化和现代工具，用土法上马一定要失败。
    然而我们的看法却不是这样。我们认为，困难是有的，但是路总是人走出来的。有了党和毛主席的正确领导，有了广大劳动群众作依靠，困难是可以克服的。丹江口工地的劳动大军，用自己的实际行动，坚决地批驳了右倾机会主义分子，证明了党的路线方针完全正确。一年来，就靠“以土为主，土洋结合”的办法，完成了土沙石九百二十余万立方米，浇筑混凝土四十一万多立方米，胜利地完成了第一期围堰工程；在坚苦而复杂的斗争当中还锻炼了一支一万多人的各类技术工人队伍，他们不但有一定的技术水平，而且有很高的政治觉悟，有坚强的组织性、纪律性；在生活方面，由于大家动手、自力更生，现在蔬菜已经能够自给75％，肉食大部分能够自给，住房问题也解决了。这一年中间，我们获得了一个胜利又一个胜利，今天的截流合龙又正说明了这一系列的胜利。
    李先念说：丹江口水利枢纽工程第一期工程和截流的胜利，对我们发展水利建设事业有重要的意义。它从水利方面进一步证明了党的总路线的一个重要的基本点——洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针的正确，证明了我们可以用“土法上马、先土后洋、土洋结合、由土到洋”这样的办法兴建大型的水利工程，也就是说，可以用更高的速度大搞水利建设。在第一期工程的施工过程中，丹江口工地提供了一些重要的施工经验，例如“以土赶水，土、沙、石组合围堰”的办法，在大型水利工程中还是一个创举。像这样的经验，我们应当认真地加以总结并且给予充分的重视。
    李先念最后说：汉水的截流对保证全部工程提前完工有着决定意义。但是，目前已经完成的工作量，从全部的工作量比较起来，还只是一部分，大量工程还在后面。今后工程已经进入全面施工阶段，因此更要鼓足干劲，必须用最快的速度，最好的质量，最勤俭的办法来完成今后的工程。他指出，毫无疑问，困难仍会是很多的，在新的困难面前，右倾保守思想可能还要出现，两种思想、两条路线的斗争还要继续进行。他号召工地的全体职工，一定要根据党的八届八中全会的精神，紧紧地依靠党的领导，高举总路线的红旗，坚持政治挂帅，大反右倾、大鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，把我们的事业由胜利推向更大的胜利。
    中共湖北省委书记处书记兼汉水丹江口工地党委书记张体学也讲了话。他说：我们的工程进入了一个新的阶段，人民的汉水进入了一个新的时代。这是我们一年零四个月来，遵循着党的总路线，克服了施工中重重困难的结果。今后，我们必须戒骄戒躁，树雄心，立大志，乘胜前进。
    河南省副省长齐文俭、中共湖北省委常委李尔重、长江流域规划办公室主任林一山、长江流域规划办公室苏联专家组组长巴克塞也夫等先后在会上讲话，祝贺丹江口工程高速度施工的胜利。最后，大会宣读了水利电力部的贺电。（附图片）
