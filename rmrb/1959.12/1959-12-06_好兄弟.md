    Good Brothers
    Yun Shunsheng
    One early morning, a wooden boat sailed under the Victory Bridge in South Street, Huangqiao Town, carrying a diesel pump. The commune member who delivered the boat hurried into the Huangqiao Water Conservancy Machinery Factory and asked the veteran workers to help them repair the diesel engine.
    The countryside was busy with the Great Leap Forward, but the factory was even more enthusiastic! The workers at the Huangqiao Water Conservancy Machinery Factory were rushing to produce parts for one hundred and eighty pumps, and their work was very intense, so they had no time for repairs. When the diesel engine was delivered, people were indeed a little hesitant to accept the repair job. However, if they didn't accept the repair job, the rice paddies of the Fenjie Commune couldn't be irrigated! Comrade Xie Hui, the factory director, decisively told the farmer brothers: "We will definitely repair this machine as quickly as possible."
    In the evening, Comrade Xie Hui personally went to the boat to check the cause of the injector nozzle problem and removed the scale.
    The final step in repairing the machine was to install the oil pump outlet valve assembly. At that time, this kind of accessory was not available on the market, and the Huangqiao Water Conservancy Machinery Factory only had one set of this type of oil pump valve, which was reserved for the factory's sixty-horsepower engine. If it was sold to the Fenjie Commune's pump, and the engine had a problem, the entire factory would have to stop production. However, the rice seedlings in Fenjie Commune had suffered a severe drought. If the seedlings could not be transplanted, it would affect the lives of tens of thousands of people. After consideration, it was decided to install the only spare set of outlet valves in the factory on the Fenjie Commune's pump.
    The machine immediately started running again, and Zhou Kailong, the commune member from Fenjie Commune who brought the machine for repair, said with emotion: "You veteran worker brothers are truly selfless good brothers."

    好兄弟
    恽顺生
    一天清早，黄桥镇南街的胜利桥下驶来了一条木船，船上装着一部柴油抽水机。放船来的公社社员一上岸就急急忙忙走进了黄桥水利机械厂，请求厂里的工人老大哥帮他们修理这部柴油机。
    农村里忙着闹跃进，可是工厂里干的更欢！黄桥水利机械厂的工人们正突击赶制着一百八十台抽水机配件的任务，工作非常紧张，早就没工夫干修理活了。这台柴油机运到时，人们确实有点不敢接受这项修理活，但是，不接受这项修理活，分界公社的秧田就灌不了水！厂长谢辉同志果断地告诉农民兄弟：“一定最快地修好这部机器”。
    晚上，谢辉同志亲自上船检查了机器咬喷油嘴的原因，消除了水垢。
    修理这部机器的最后一关是配装油泵出油阀组。当时，市场上买不到这种配件，黄桥水利机械厂也仅有一套这种油泵阀，是留给全厂六十马力发动机备用的，如果卖给分界公社抽水机用了，万一发动机出了毛病，全厂就得停止生产。但是分界公社的秧苗已经受到严重的干旱，要是秧插不下去，就关系着几万人的生活。考虑结果，还是决定把自己厂里唯一备用的一套出油阀给分界公社的抽水机装上了。
    机器立刻又转动起来了，送机器来修理的分界公社社员周开龙感动地说：“你们工人老大哥真是大公无私的好兄弟。”
