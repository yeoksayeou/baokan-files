Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 6th: The Chongqing Machine Tool Plant had comprehensively overfulfilled this year's national plan by November 29th. The plan completion status is as follows: output at 100.22%; total output value at 100.94%; commodity output value at 109.04%; labor productivity at 102.3%; comparable product cost reduced by 25.49%; all product variety plans completed; parts qualification rate reached 98.16%, and all machine tools leaving the factory were qualified. Safety accidents were reduced compared to last year.

At the beginning of this year, a few cadres in the factory had complacency and slackening emotions, thinking that production had doubled last year, so this year they could take a breather and "make a breakthrough in the second half of the year." The Party Committee mobilized the masses to criticize this emotion, calling on all factory workers to establish the idea of continuous revolution and continued leap forward, so the production plan for the first quarter was completed ahead of schedule. In April, when all factory workers discussed the plan, a few cadres had a fear of difficulty regarding the temporary difficulty of raw material supply not keeping up with production needs, and attempted to implement the plan at a lower level that could be easily completed. Therefore, the Party Committee repeatedly explained to the workers that the implementation of the plan was to implement the reality of advancement in order to continue the leap forward. The workers were mobilized to criticize the fear of difficulty through methods such as accounting and comparison; then, the production plan was completed ahead of schedule for two consecutive months.

In July, when all factory workers further improved product quality, a few cadres opposed high output and high quality, saying that "more and faster cannot be good and economical, good and economical cannot be more and faster." In August, according to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the factory Party Committee led the workers to struggle against this right-leaning thought, pointing out that the view of opposing more, faster, better, and more economical actually cannot strive for high speed and cannot realize the Party's general line for socialist construction. Many workers cited a large number of facts of high quality and high output that had occurred in production, explaining the dialectical relationship between output and quality, and overcoming right-leaning conservative thought. As a result, from August to now, the factory's output and quality have both leaped forward, and are getting better month by month.

While continuously eliminating ideological obstacles, the factory's Party and government leaders mobilized the workers to continuously overcome the weak links in production. The unstable quality of castings was the weakest link in the factory's production. In order to completely solve this problem, the factory Party Committee Secretary took command and established an investigation and research team to analyze the various processes of casting production and find that the main reason was the lack of a complete set of technological regulations. Then, leading cadres, technicians, and workers combined to carefully summarize the advanced operating methods of the workers and formulated operating regulations to ensure the quality of castings, so the quality of castings was rapidly improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 6th: The Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant has comprehensively completed the annual national plan ahead of schedule. By the end of November, the completion of various tasks compared with the annual plan: the total output value doubled, the main products of locomotives exceeded six units, and freight cars exceeded one hundred and forty-five units, all of which met the standards in quality. Profits turned over to the state exceeded 14.9%. Due to cost reduction, 945,800 yuan of funds were saved. Labor productivity increased by 15.4% based on all employees, and 32.1% based on production workers.

The workers of the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant fought hard last year, overcoming difficulties such as outdated equipment and insufficient technical strength, and successfully trial-produced locomotives and freight cars, ending the fifty-year history of the factory of "only being able to repair, not manufacture." This year, the factory Party Committee, in response to the right-leaning thoughts of a few cadres who believed that "the potential of last year's Great Leap Forward was exhausted, there is no way to work cleverly, and the leap forward has reached its peak," launched a large-scale airing of views, debates, and big-character posters by the workers from the beginning of the year, and pointed out the favorable conditions for the leap forward. It organized all factory workers to quickly launch a competition movement of "five highs" (high awareness, high quantity, high efficiency, high quality, high attendance rate), "seven cleverness" (clever planning, clever arrangement, clever design, clever organization, clever management, clever operation, clever use of materials), "three savings" (saving labor, saving materials, saving expenses), and breaking through six barriers (material barrier, technical barrier, quality barrier, transportation barrier, contradiction between reconstruction and production), so that many problems that could not be solved in the past were solved.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 5th: The Tianjin No. 3 Steel Rolling Plant has comprehensively completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule. As of November 30th, the plant's output value exceeded the annual plan by 29%; output exceeded the plan by 26.5%; product variety was completed according to the plan; the first-class product rate increased by 3.48% compared with the plan; production cost was reduced by 1.27% compared with the plan; labor productivity exceeded the plan by 28%; and profit exceeded the plan by 83.6%.

The Tianjin No. 3 Steel Rolling Plant was merged from several small steel rolling plants, with simple equipment and low degree of mechanization. Based on this situation, the factory Party Committee proposed to all factory workers at the beginning of the year to realize "three-izations": automation of steel rolling, multi-nozzleization of steel tapping, and mechanization of handling and packaging. The entire factory and each workshop established technical revolution leading groups composed of administrative leaders, Party organization secretaries, technicians, and veteran workers. Workers innovated everywhere. In the first half of the year, all factory workers put forward more than 8,000 innovation proposals. After the technical revolution leading group studied them, they were summarized into 110 items. By November of this year, 98 items had been realized. Each workshop has fully or partially realized the circular arrangement of steel rolling, mechanization or semi-mechanization of packaging and handling, and improved and added conveying chains, hot cutting machines, lifting platforms, material handling machines, reverse steel troughs, steel shifting frames, conveying rollers, steam sleds, and pressure roller lathes, thereby reducing labor intensity and improving output and labor productivity.

After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the factory, on the basis of opposing right-leaning and boosting morale, successively established and improved 14 production management systems, including production scheduling, inspection, shift handover, post responsibility system, raw material management, and working capital management. Measures were taken to select raw materials carefully and to maintain equipment with a "prevent problems before they occur" approach. The production operation time per shift was increased from the original four or five shifts to seven to seven and a half shifts; product quality was also improved. (Attached picture)

After the No. 3 workshop of Tianjin No. 3 Steel Rolling Plant realized the circular arrangement of steel rolling, the average output per shift increased from about 35 tons to more than 70 tons. Originally, more than 20 people were needed to operate the rolling mill per shift, but now only five people are needed. This is a worker feeding materials.

    思想技术相辅前进
    全年计划提前完成
    重庆机床厂职工树立不断革命的思想
    太原机车厂开展“五高”“七巧”“三省”竞赛
    天  津轧钢三厂技术革新建议开花结果
    南北三厂全面跃进
    据新华社重庆6日电　重庆机床厂到11月29日为止，已经全面超额完成了今年国家计划。完成计划的情况是：产量为100.22％；总产值为100.94％；商品产值为109.04％；劳动生产率为102.3％；可比产品成本降低25.49％；品种计划全部完成；零件合格率达到98.16％，出厂机床台台合格。安全事故比去年减少。
    今年年初，工厂中有少数干部曾产生了自满、松劲情绪，认为去年生产翻了一番，今年可以歇口气了，“要跃进，下半年再来突击一下”。党委发动群众批判了这种情绪，号召全厂职工树立不断革命、继续跃进的思想，因而第一季度提前完成了生产计划。4月份，全厂职工讨论计划时，少数干部对原料材料供应跟不上生产需要的暂时性困难产生了畏难情绪，企图把计划落实在不费力气就可以完成的较低水平上。于是，党委又反复向职工讲清楚计划落实是落先进之实，是为了继续跃进。发动职工用算账对比等方法批判了畏难思想；接着，连续两个月提前完成了生产计划。
    7月份，当全厂职工进一步提高产品质量时，少数干部把高产和优质对立起来，说“多快不能好省，好省不能多快”。8月份，厂党委根据中共八届八中全会精神，领导职工对这种右倾思想作斗争，指出把多快和好省对立起来的观点，实际上就不能力争高速度，不能实现党的社会主义建设总路线。许多工人举出大量生产中出现过的优质又高产的事实，说明产量和质量的辩证关系，战胜了右倾保守思想。结果，从8月份到现在，全厂产量和质量都双双跃进，而且一个月比一个月好。
    在不断扫除思想障碍的同时，工厂党政领导发动职工连续克服生产中的薄弱环节。铸件质量不够稳定是全厂生产中最薄弱的环节，为了彻底解决这个问题，工厂党委书记挂帅，成立调查研究组，对铸件生产的各个工序进行了分析，找出主要原因是缺乏一套完整的工艺规程。然后，由领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合，细致地总结了工人中的先进操作法，并制定了切实保证铸件质量的操作规程，铸件质量因此迅速提高。
    据新华社太原6日电　太原机车车辆厂提前全面完成了全年国家计划。到11月底，各项任务完成的情况和全年计划相比：生产总值翻了一番，主要产品中的机车超过了六台、货车超过了一百四十五辆，质量都合乎标准，上缴利润超过14.9％，由于成本降低节约资金九十四万五千八百元，劳动生产率按全员计算提高15.4％，按生产工人计算提高32.1％。
    太原机车车辆厂职工去年大战一年，克服了设备陈旧和技术力量不足等困难，试制成功机车和货车，结束了建厂五十年来“只能修，不能造”的历史。今年，工厂党委针对少数干部认为“去年大跃进潜力挖光，巧干没门，跃进到顶”等右倾思想，从年初起就发动职工大鸣大放大辩论，并且指出跃进的有利条件，组织全厂职工迅速展开五高（觉悟高，数量高，效率高，质量高，出勤率高）、七巧（巧计划，巧安排，巧设计，巧组织，巧管理，巧操作，巧用料）、三省（省工，省料，省费用）、破六关（材料关，技术关，质量关，运输关，改建与生产矛盾关）的竞赛运动，使许多过去解决不了的问题都得到了解决。
    据新华社天津5日电　天津轧钢三厂职工提前全面完成了今年国家计划。到11月30日止，全厂产值超过年计划29％；产量超过计划26.5％；产品品种按计划完成；一级品率比计划提高3.48％；生产成本比计划降低1.27％；劳动生产率超过计划28％；利润超过计划83.6％。
    天津轧钢三厂是由几个小型轧钢厂合并起来的，设备简陋，机械化程度低，根据这个情况，工厂党委会在年初就向全厂职工提出要实现“三化”：轧钢自动化，出钢多嘴化，搬运包装机械化。全厂和各车间成立了由行政领导干部、党组织书记、技术人员和老工人组成的技术革命领导小组。职工们人人闹革新，处处有革新。在上半年内，全厂职工就提出革新建议八千多件，经过技术革命领导小组研究后，归纳为一百零一项，到今年11月份已经实现九十八项，各个车间全部或部分地实现了轧钢围盘化、包装搬运机械化或半机械化，改进和增设了输送链、热切机、升降台、搬料机、反钢槽、移钢架、输送辊、汽橇和压辊车床等设备，从而减轻了劳动强度，提高了产量和劳动生产率。
    在党的八届八中全会以后，这个厂在反右倾、鼓干劲的基础上，先后建立和健全了生产调度、检验、交接班、岗位负责制、原料材料管理、流动资金管理等十四项生产管理制度，采取了精选原料的措施和“不等发病就先预防”的设备维修办法，每班的生产作业时间由原来的四五个台时提高到七个至七个半台时；产品质量也提高了。（附图片）
    天津轧钢三厂三车间实现轧钢围盘化后，平均每班产量由三十五吨左右提高到七十多吨，原来每班需要二十多人操纵轧钢机，现在只要五个人就行了。这是工人正在投料。新华社记者　田　明摄
