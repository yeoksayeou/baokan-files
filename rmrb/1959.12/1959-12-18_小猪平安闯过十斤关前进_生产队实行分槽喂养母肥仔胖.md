It is often said, "Piglets have a hard time getting past the ten-jin mark." In fact, as long as people are willing to use their brains, this hurdle is easy to overcome. The Qianjin Production Team Livestock Farm in Zhujing Commune, Jinshan County, Shanghai, has a good method, which is to feed the "licking plate" pigs (i.e., piglets) and sows in separate troughs, and their piglets all safely pass this mark. After May of this year, the sows in this livestock farm gave birth to four hundred and twenty-seven piglets (only one died of heatstroke), all of which grew up lively and strong. Therefore, people at the purchasing station all say that the piglets they sell are "branded goods."

In the first month or so after piglets are born, they eat only the sow's milk. As long as the sow's milk is plentiful, the piglets are all well-fed, and the pig sheds are kept clean and hygienic, the piglets are unlikely to get sick. After a month of raising, when the piglets grow to about seven jin, they begin to "lick the plate" and learn to eat feed. At this time, if they are not taken care of properly, problems are most likely to occur.

Before May of this year, the Qianjin Production Team Livestock Farm still used the old method for raising "licking plate" pigs: piglets and sows ate in the same trough. As a result, problems arose. Originally, the piglets were all round and plump, but soon after "licking the plate," their hair stood on end, their backs arched, and they became thin with pointed mouths and buttocks, and bellies as big as drums. The feeders were very anxious, but could not figure out what the reason was. The team's Party branch secretary, the livestock farm manager, and the feeders went to the pig shed to study and observe the pigs eating. They saw that when eating, the sows rushed to eat all the concentrate first, and what was left were all coarse bran and hard grass, which were difficult to digest and had little nutrition. Of course, the piglets would not do well if they ate it. If the piglets were not full, they would spend all day burrowing under the sow's belly to suckle, no wonder the sow did not grow well even after eating the feed. After finding out the reason, they initially wanted to raise the piglets and sows in separate sheds, but it was inconvenient to separate the sheds because the piglets still needed to suckle. What should they do? The three people were in the pig shed, watching and discussing. "Three cobblers are worth more than one Zhuge Liang," and they came up with a good idea: to separate the original pig shed with a fence, with an opening in the middle, so that the piglets could pass through, but the sows could not. The piglets' feed was placed outside the fence, and after the piglets came out to eat, they could crawl back in to suckle the sow's milk. The piglets should eat more concentrate, but the amount of concentrate for the livestock farm each month could not be increased. They decided to lower the feeding standard for sows, reducing the concentrate from the original 25% to 10%, and the saved concentrate was given to the piglets.

After they came up with a solution, they first tested it in one shed. The sow and twelve piglets in this shed were already skin and bones, and four of the piglets also had diarrhea. After separate trough feeding, they cooked the piglets' feed thoroughly and mashed it, and chose only the tender grass for green fodder. After the piglets crawled out of the fence and ate their fill, they went back to sleep soundly and no longer licked the sow's trough. In ten days, the piglets all changed their appearance, their hair shone, and they grew a body of meat. The livestock farm cadres were initially worried that the sows would not be well-raised because they ate less concentrate. But on the contrary, because the piglets were full, they stopped bothering the sows to suckle, the sows suckled less often, and they became fatter day by day, and their estrus period came earlier. Without increasing the concentrate feed, the piglets were raised fat and the sows were plump.

    小猪平安闯过十斤关前进
    生产队实行分槽喂养母肥仔胖

    常言说：“小猪难过十斤关”。其实，只要人肯动脑筋，这个关也是容易过的。上海市金山县朱泾公社前进生产队畜牧场有一个好办法，就是把“舔盘”猪（即小猪）和母猪分槽喂食，他们的小猪都平平安安过了这个关。今年5月以后，这个畜牧场的母猪生了四百二十七头小猪（只有一只中暑死去），都长得活泼健壮。因此收购站的人都说他们出售的小猪是“名牌货”。
    小猪出生以后的个把月里，吃的全是母猪的奶，只要母猪奶水旺，小猪只只吃饱，猪棚讲究清洁卫生，小猪不大会生病。小猪养了一个月，长到七斤左右，就开始“舔盘”，学习吃饲料。这时候如果照料不周到，最容易出毛病。
    今年5月份以前前进生产队畜牧场养“舔盘”猪还是用的老办法：小猪和母猪在一个槽里吃食。结果就出了事情。原来小猪都是长得圆鼓鼓的，“舔盘”不久，毛竖起来了，背也弓起来了，瘦得嘴巴屁股两头尖，肚皮大得像个鼓。饲养员很着急，但是猜不透究竟是什么道理。这个队的党支部书记、畜牧场场长和饲养员就到猪棚去研究，观察猪吃食的情形。他们看到吃食时母猪抢着先把精料吃光，剩下的都是统糠、硬草，很难消化，营养又少，小猪吃了当然不好。小猪吃不饱，就整天钻在母猪肚皮下吃奶，难怪母猪吃了料也不见长好。找出原因以后，他们起初想把小猪和母猪分棚饲养，但小猪还要吃奶，分棚很不方便。怎么办呢？三个人就在猪棚里，一边看一边商量。“三个臭皮匠，顶个诸葛亮”，他们想到了一个好办法：把原来的猪棚用栅栏隔开，中间开一个口，小猪能过去，母猪过不来。小猪的猪食就放在栅栏外面，小猪出来吃食以后，又可以钻回去吃母猪的奶。小猪吃的精料要多些，但畜牧场每月的精料数量不能增加。他们决定把母猪的饲养标准降低一些，精料由原来的占二成五减少到占一成，省下的精料匀给小猪吃。
    他们想出办法以后，先在一个棚里试验。这个棚的一只母猪和十二只小猪原来都已瘦得皮包骨头，有四只小猪还有拉稀屎的病。分槽喂食以后，他们把小猪的猪食煮透、捣烂，青饲料都拣嫩的草。小猪钻出栅栏吃饱以后，回去就呼呼睡觉，再也不去舔母猪的槽了。十天功夫，小猪只只变了样，毛发亮，长起一身肉。畜牧场干部起初还担心母猪吃的精料减少，会养不好。但事实相反，因为小猪吃得饱，就不缠着母猪吃奶了，母猪喂奶的次数减少，一天天胖起来，发情期也提早了。精饲料不要增加，养得小猪肥、母猪胖。
