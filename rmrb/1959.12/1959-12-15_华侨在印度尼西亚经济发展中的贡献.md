The imperialists and reactionary forces in Indonesia, in order to create pretexts for anti-Chinese and anti-China activities, have resorted to distorting facts and equating overseas Chinese with the colonialists who invaded Indonesia. Their intentions are extremely malicious. However, facts cannot be distorted in any way. Overseas Chinese have lived in friendship with the Indonesian people for more than fifteen centuries. Overseas Chinese have never been invaders to Indonesia. On the contrary, they and the Indonesian people have shared weal and woe under Dutch colonial rule, shed blood and sweat to develop Indonesia's beautiful mountains and rivers, and made positive contributions to Indonesia's economic development.

As early as more than 1,500 years ago, overseas Chinese began to immigrate to Indonesia, but it was after the Dutch colonialists occupied Indonesia from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century that they truly settled there on a large scale. In particular, in the past century or so, China has been subjected to the dual oppression and exploitation of imperialism and domestic reactionary rulers. The countryside has fallen into bankruptcy, and a large number of poor farmers (including urban poor) in coastal provinces, mainly Guangdong and Fujian, have drifted to Indonesia to make a living. They left their homes and crossed the oceans, mainly forced by livelihood; they neither invaded Indonesia with guns and warships like Western colonialists, nor did they have any colonial ambitions or desires to plunder wealth in Indonesia. Some of them were even abducted and deceived by Dutch colonialists from the coastal areas of China to serve as hard laborers for land reclamation during the period when the Dutch East India Company was developing colonies in the Indonesian archipelago, the so-called "indentured laborers." Therefore, after the overseas Chinese settled in Indonesia, they naturally suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism together with the Indonesian people, shared weal and woe, jointly developed resources, and developed the economy. Many overseas Chinese intermarried with the local people, learned the Indonesian language, accepted the customs and habits of the Indonesian people, and established close feelings with the Indonesian people.

Indonesia's products are extremely rich, but due to the scourge of imperialism and colonialism, Indonesia has long been in a state of poverty and backwardness. In history, overseas Chinese have played a certain role in developing Indonesia's products, introducing and promoting advanced production technologies. Everyone knows that Indonesia's pepper is famous and its output ranks first in the world. Overseas Chinese have contributed to the increase in pepper production. Overseas Chinese changed the pepper cultivation method to using wooden pillars, so that the pepper vines wrap around the wooden pillars instead of the tree trunks, which can avoid wasting pepper nutrients, and the leaves on the vines are often removed to give it more sunlight. This cultivation method also facilitates rational close planting and increases yield. For example, in the Bangka pepper plantation in Indonesia, this close planting method can plant 2,500 trees per hectare, while in the Lampung pepper plantation, the old method can only plant 1,200 trees, a difference of more than double. Indonesia's tea output ranks fourth in the world. Overseas Chinese have also contributed to the development of Indonesian tea. Indonesian tea seeds were introduced by overseas Chinese. The Indonesian word for tea is "TEE," which is a Hokkien word, fully indicating the origin of Indonesian tea. "Ying Huan Zhi Lue" pointed out: "Garoba (referring to Java) has learned to grow Min tea in recent years, and the taste is quite good." According to the book "Old Batavia," Chinese tea seeds were introduced to Indonesia in 1681. The "Dutch East Indies Encyclopedia" also records that tea-making technicians from Guangdong taught techniques in Java in 1832 and 1833. The world-famous Java sugar was also first created and promoted by overseas Chinese. The book "Old Batavia" pointed out that as early as the seventeenth century, overseas Chinese had established sugar factories in Jakarta, using Chinese sugar refining methods to refine sugar cane, and using hydraulic mills, with a large output. In order to facilitate the transportation of wood from the suburbs of Jakarta into the city as fuel, overseas Chinese Pan Mingyan dug a canal next to Gajah Mada Street (formerly Molenvliet Street). This canal played a good role in the exchange of materials between Jakarta and the suburbs. In addition, the brewing industry (using sugar sauce to make wine) related to the sugar industry was also pioneered by overseas Chinese.

On Indonesia's beautiful and rich land, overseas Chinese and Indonesian people work hard together for generations, using their wisdom and hands to explore the treasures of nature in the jungles, mountains, and oceans. Overseas Chinese workers have become close partners of the Indonesian working masses in Indonesia's economic development. For example, Indonesia's tin output accounts for about 20% of the world's total output, ranking second in the world, and occupies a very important position in Indonesia's export materials. The mining of these tin mines is mainly in Bangka, Belitung, and the Riau Islands. According to statistics in 1917, there were 20,000 Chinese workers in the Bangka tin mines and more than 15,000 Chinese workers in the Belitung mines. At present, the vast majority of tin mine workers in Bangka and Belitung are still Chinese workers. For example, in Indonesia's aquatic products industry, the famous Bagan Siapi-api fishing area was developed by overseas Chinese. Centuries ago, overseas Chinese engaged in fishing in Bagan Siapi-api, a desolate fishing village on the east coast of Sumatra. Overseas Chinese fishermen struggled with nature there year after year, unafraid of wind, sun, rain, and finally developed this desolate village into one of the world's largest fishing grounds (see Sjah Soetopo: Geography of Indonesia), supplying the Indonesian market with more than 50 million kilograms of fish, fish roe, shrimp, and shrimp paste every year. Not far from Bagan Siapi-api, the Riau Islands are the center of Indonesia's sawmill and charcoal industry, producing a large number of wooden boards and charcoal. These two enterprises are also mainly developed by overseas Chinese. In addition, the vast tobacco plantations in the Medan (Deli) area were also reclaimed by Chinese workers. According to statistics, a total of 356,000 "indentured laborers" came to Medan from China between 1888 and 1931. Bersel pointed out in his book "Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia" that the cultivation of Medan tobacco plantations in the first sixty years depended entirely on the labor of overseas Chinese.

Since two-thirds of Indonesia's population is concentrated on the island of Java, while the islands of Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Kalimantan, which have less labor, are rich in mineral and forest resources. Therefore, the Dutch colonialists tried to lure a large number of Chinese workers from the coastal provinces of China to develop these desolate areas. An old overseas Chinese once described the situation of Chinese workers developing these areas at that time: Western capitalists recruited a batch of fifty Chinese workers to develop a plantation, opened roads and advanced, demarcated boundaries, felled trees and cut grass, and leveled the soil. It was originally planned to reclaim and plant within half a year, but in half a year, only two of the fifty Chinese workers survived, and the other forty-eight died of disease, acclimatization, or were killed by poisonous snakes and beasts. The Dutch capitalists had to recruit a second batch of fifty Chinese workers. After another half a year, the reclamation was completed and planting began, and thirty-six more of the second batch of Chinese workers died. In this way, in order to develop a plantation, a hundred Chinese workers were employed, and eighty-four were sacrificed. At that time, many Indonesian laborers from Java were also recruited to work in plantations in other provinces. Under the enslavement of Western colonialists, tens of thousands of Indonesian laborers and Chinese workers even sacrificed their precious lives in the cause of developing Indonesia's resources.

It can be seen that whether in the development of Indonesia's agriculture, mining, forestry, and fishery, overseas Chinese, like the broad masses of Indonesian people, have contributed generations of labor. The early overseas Chinese contributed to the development of Indonesia's resources, the dissemination and introduction of various production technologies, and the production experience they have accumulated over a long period of time in the labor production process, which are all factors in developing Indonesia's social productive forces and promoting Indonesia's economic development. Although in the process of Indonesia's economic development, some overseas Chinese have accumulated capital over time, integrated a sum of capital to operate enterprises, and obtained profits, they have also invested the profits they have obtained in local economic construction undertakings. Like Indonesia's national capitalists, they have promoted Indonesia's economic development, and at the same time, like Indonesia's national capital, they are being squeezed and oppressed by imperialist monopoly capital. As for the overseas Chinese small merchants and peddlers who travel around the villages of Indonesia, they have played a good role in enlivening Indonesia's urban and rural exchanges, which goes without saying. Therefore, how can overseas Chinese be equated with the Western colonialist forces that invaded, plundered, and humiliated Indonesia? The imperialists and the Indonesian forces with ulterior motives want to reverse black and white, distort historical facts, and force the broad masses of Indonesian people to believe that overseas Chinese are their enemies. This is definitely a futile attempt.

    华侨在印度尼西亚经济发展中的贡献
    学仁
    帝国主义者和印度尼西亚的反动势力为了制造排华反华活动的借口，不惜歪曲事实，把华侨同侵略印度尼西亚的殖民主义者相提并论，其用心是十分恶毒的。但是，事实是无论如何也歪曲不了的。华侨同印度尼西亚人民友好相处已经有十五个世纪以上的历史了，华侨对于印度尼西亚来说，从来都不是侵略者，相反，他们和印度尼西亚人民曾经在荷兰的殖民统治下共过患难，为开发印度尼西亚的美好山河流过血汗，对印度尼西亚经济发展有过积极的贡献。
    远在一千五百多年以前，华侨便开始移居印度尼西亚，但是真正大规模的在那里定居下来，还是在十七世纪初至十八世纪中叶荷兰殖民主义者侵占印度尼西亚以后。特别是近百余年来，中国受到帝国主义和国内反动统治者的双重压迫和剥削，农村陷于破产，沿海各省主要是广东福建两省的广大贫苦农民（其中也有城镇贫民），大批地飘泊到印度尼西亚谋生。他们背井离乡，远渡重洋，主要是迫于生计；他们既不像西方殖民主义者用枪炮和军舰侵入印度尼西亚，也没有对印度尼西亚怀有任何殖民和掠夺财富的野心。他们中间还有一部分甚至是在荷属东印度公司到印度尼西亚群岛开拓殖民地时期被荷兰殖民者从中国沿海掳掠和拐骗来充当垦荒的苦工，即所谓“契约工人”。因此，华侨在印度尼西亚定居下来以后，很自然地和印度尼西亚人民都受帝国主义的压迫和剥削，同甘共苦，一起开发资源，发展经济；其中有不少华侨和当地人民通了婚，学会了印度尼西亚的语言，接受了印度尼西亚人民的风俗习惯，同印度尼西亚人民建立了亲密的感情。
    印度尼西亚的物产是极其丰富的，只是由于遭受帝国主义和殖民主义的祸害，才使印度尼西亚长期处于贫困和落后的状态。而华侨在历史上对于开发印度尼西亚的物产，介绍和推广先进的生产技术，起了一定的作用。大家都知道，印度尼西亚的胡椒是遐迩闻名的，产量占世界第一位。华侨对于胡椒的增产，曾经有过贡献。华侨栽培胡椒改用木柱法，使胡椒缠绕在木柱上而不缠绕在树干上，这样可以避免浪费胡椒的养分，并且经常摘除蔓上的叶子，使它多得阳光。这种栽培法，还便于进行合理密植，增加产量。例如在印度尼西亚邦加胡椒园内采用这种密植法，每公顷可种二千五百棵，而在楠榜胡椒园内采用老法种植，只能栽种一千二百棵，相差达一倍多。印度尼西亚的茶，产量占世界第四位。华侨对于印度尼西亚茶的发展也有过贡献。印度尼西亚的茶种是由华侨传入的，印度尼西亚语称茶为“TEE”，这是福建话，充分表明了印度尼西亚茶的起源。“瀛环志略”指出：“噶罗巴（指爪哇）近年学种闽茶，味颇不恶。”据“古巴达维亚”一书的记载，1681年中国茶种传入印度尼西亚。在“荷印（尼）大百科全书”还记载着1832年和1833年广东的制茶技术人员在爪哇传授技术。世界闻名的爪哇糖，也是由华侨首创并加以推广的。“古巴达维亚”一书指出，远在十七世纪华侨已在雅加达建立了蔗糖厂，用中国的炼糖方法提炼蔗糖，并且利用水力转磨，产量很大。华侨潘明岩为了便于从雅加达郊外将木材运入市内作燃料，曾在迦查马达街（旧称摩仑弗力街）旁开浚运河，这条运河对于雅加达和郊区的物资交流曾经起了很好的作用。另外和制糖业有关的酿酒业（用糖酱炼酒），也是由华侨所首创起来的。
    在印度尼西亚美丽富饶的国土上，华侨和印度尼西亚人民一起世世代代辛勤劳动，用他们的智慧和双手向丛林峻岭和海洋探索自然的宝藏。华侨工人在印度尼西亚的经济开发事业中已经成为印度尼西亚劳动群众的亲密伙伴。例如印度尼西亚的锡，产量占世界总产量的20％左右，居世界第二，在印度尼西亚的输出物资中占着极重要的地位。这些锡矿的开采主要是在邦加、勿里洞和寥岛等，据1917年的统计，在邦加锡矿场有二万华工，勿里洞矿场有一万五千多华工。目前在邦加和勿里洞的锡矿工人中，绝大部分还是华工。再如在印度尼西亚的水产事业中，像著名的峇眼亚比渔区就是华侨开辟的。华侨在几世纪以前在苏门答腊东海岸一个荒凉的渔村峇眼亚比，从事捕鱼。华侨渔民在那里长年累月与自然界作斗争，不怕风吹日晒雨淋，终于使这个荒凉的村落发展成为世界最大渔场之一（见斯哈·苏托坡：印度尼西亚地理），每年供应印度尼西亚市场以鱼、鱼卵、虾和虾膏在五千万公斤以上。离峇眼亚比不远的寥岛是印度尼西亚锯木业和木炭业的中心，出产大量的木板和木炭，这两种企业主要也是由华侨发展起来的。此外如棉兰（日里）一带的广大的烟草园，也是由华工开垦的。根据统计，从1888年到1931年之间由中国前来棉兰的“契约工人”总计有三十五万六千人。勃塞尔在“东南亚华侨”一书中指出，棉兰烟草园最初六十年间的垦植，全靠华侨的劳动力。
    由于印度尼西亚人口三分之二集中在爪哇岛，而劳力少的苏门答腊、苏拉威西、加里曼丹等岛各地却有着丰富的矿产和森林。因此，荷兰殖民者当时就设法从中国沿海各省诱骗大批华工到这些荒凉地区进行开发。一位老华侨曾经对当时华工开辟这些地区的情况作过这样的叙述：西方资本家为了开辟一个种植园，招收了一批华工五十名，开路而进，画定界限，伐木割草，平治土壤。原来预定在半年之内就可以垦荒种植，但半年之中五十名华工，幸存者只有二名，其他四十八名则死于疾病、水土不宜，或为毒蛇猛虎所害。荷兰资本家不得不再招收第二批华工五十名。又经半年，才完成垦荒，开始种植，而第二批华工又死亡三十六名。就这样，为了开垦一个种植园，役使百名华工，而牺牲者八十四名。当时也有许多爪哇的印度尼西亚劳工被招收到外省进行开拓种植园的工作。成千上万的印度尼西亚劳动者和华侨工人，在当时西方殖民主义者的奴役下，在开发印度尼西亚资源的事业中甚至牺牲了宝贵的生命。
    由此可见，无论在印度尼西亚的农业、矿业、林业和渔业各个方面的开发上，华侨和广大印度尼西亚人民一样都贡献了世世代代的劳动。早期华侨在印度尼西亚资源的开发，各种生产技术的传播和介绍，他们在劳动生产过程中长期所积累的生产经验，都是发展印度尼西亚社会生产力，促进印度尼西亚经济发展的因素。虽然在印度尼西亚经济发展过程中，也有一部分华侨日积月累，集成了一笔资本经营企业，并取得了利润，但他们也是把所取得的利润投放在当地的经济建设事业上，他们和印度尼西亚的民族资本家一样对印度尼西亚的经济发展有着推进的作用，同时也和印度尼西亚的民族资本一样受着帝国主义垄断资本的排挤和压迫。至于奔波于印度尼西亚乡村的华侨小商小贩，对于活跃印度尼西亚的城乡交流起了良好的作用，这就更不用说了。因此，怎么能够把华侨同侵略、掠夺和凌辱印度尼西亚的西方殖民主义势力相提并论呢？帝国主义者和印度尼西亚的别有用心的势力要想颠倒黑白，涂改历史事实，强使印度尼西亚广大人民相信华侨是他们的敌人，这肯定是枉费心机的。
