Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 9th December: U.S. President Eisenhower concluded his forty-hour visit to Pakistan this morning and left Karachi for Kabul.

In a joint communique issued on December 8th, Eisenhower and Pakistani President Ayub emphasized the need to strengthen the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), two aggressive military blocs.

The communique stated that the two presidents reiterated "the importance of these organizations in maintaining the stability and security of the regions they encompass." The communique stated that the two countries were determined to "continue to vigorously support" these military blocs.

The communique said that Eisenhower and Ayub "generally reviewed political issues worldwide, particularly the relations between the free world and the Sino-Soviet bloc." They also "discussed relations between countries in the region and the urgent desire to find solutions to existing disputes." The communique mentioned the "aid" provided by the United States to Pakistan. The communique stated: "They recognized the heavy financial burden placed on Pakistan by its efforts to implement huge development plans while maintaining armed forces commensurate with national security." According to United Press International, Ayub was eager to know whether the United States would continue to provide Pakistan with more than $250 million in "aid" annually, in addition to military assistance. It was revealed that Eisenhower intended to promise that the United States would continue to give Pakistan "a relatively large amount of aid," but "was unwilling to give a definite answer because the Congressional appropriations for next year have not yet been determined."

Ayub told reporters that he and Eisenhower also discussed the issue of the United States supplying weapons to Pakistan. He said, "We already have a lot of American weapons, so it is best if they are all American weapons."

It is worth noting that the U.S. ruling clique used the opportunity of this visit to openly carry out anti-China planning. According to Eisenhower's press secretary, Hagerty, at a press conference held in Karachi on December 8th, the two presidents reached a complete agreement in their talks to deal with the so-called "strategy of Communist China to seize land" (U.S. Information Service).

Hagerty also said that Eisenhower "asked Ayub to talk in detail about Pakistan's attitude towards Kashmir and Afghanistan" during the talks. Ayub revealed at a press conference on December 8th that he and Eisenhower discussed the Kashmir issue and the so-called "Chinese border intrusion" and "the situation in Afghanistan." He stated that Pakistan hoped that Eisenhower "could use his personal influence on the Indian Prime Minister." He said that Eisenhower "also understands this."

    艾森豪威尔结束对巴基斯坦访问
    强调军事集团的重要性
    新华社9日讯　卡拉奇消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔今天上午结束了对巴基斯坦的四十小时的访问，离开卡拉奇前往喀布尔。
    艾森豪威尔和巴基斯坦总统阿尤布在8日发表的联合公报中，强调要加强东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织这两个侵略性军事集团。
    公报说，两国总统再度强调这两个军事集团在“维护这些组织包括的地区的稳定和安全方面的重要性。”公报说，两国决心“继续大力支持”这两个军事集团。
    公报说，艾森豪威尔和阿尤布“一般地回顾了世界范围内的政治问题，特别是自由世界同中苏集团的关系问题。”他们还“讨论了这个地区的国家之间的关系，以及对现有的争执寻找解决办法的迫切愿望。”公报谈到了美国给予巴基斯坦的“援助”问题。公报说：“他们认识到巴基斯坦努力进行巨大的发展计划、同时保持同国家安全相适应的武装部队而加在巴基斯坦身上的沉重的财政负担。”据合众国际社透露，阿尤布迫切要知道美国是否会继续按照目前的情况，每年除军事援助外给巴基斯坦二亿五千万美元以上的“援助”。据透露，艾森豪威尔打算答应美国将继续给巴基斯坦“比较大量的援助”，但是“由于明年国会拨款还没有定，不肯给以肯定的答允。”
    阿尤布在向记者谈话时说，他同艾森豪威尔还谈到美国供给巴基斯坦武器的问题。他说，“我们已经有很多美式武器，所以最好全部都是美式武器。”
    值得注意的是，美国统治集团利用这次访问的时机，公开进行反华的策划。据艾森豪威尔的新闻秘书哈格蒂8日在卡拉奇举行的记者招待会上说，两国总统在会谈中达成了完全的协议，来对付所谓“共产党中国夺取土地的策略”（美国新闻处）。
    哈格蒂还说，艾森豪威尔在会谈中“请阿尤布详细谈了巴基斯坦对克什米尔和阿富汗的态度”。阿尤布8日在记者招待会上透露，他同艾森豪威尔讨论了克什米尔问题和所谓“中国入侵边境”、“阿富汗局势”等问题。他表示，巴基斯坦希望艾森豪威尔“能对印度总理使用他个人的影响”。他说，艾森豪威尔“也了解到这一点”。
