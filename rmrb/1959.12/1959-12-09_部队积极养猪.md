Troops Actively Raise Pigs

The Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Jinan region troops has raised a large number of pigs this year. Based on the current number of pigs in the pens, there is an average of one pig for every 1.9 people.

The main reasons they have been able to raise so many pigs are the Party committee's emphasis, the leaders taking the lead, and everyone pitching in. Over the past year, the Party committee of the headquarters and all branches have included pig raising and other production activities in their work agenda, with dedicated production committee members. Party groups constantly hold meetings to study how to ensure the completion of production tasks. He Zhucheng, the Political Department's Major General, personally built pig pens and collected feed, and participated in every production meeting, which also promoted the production enthusiasm of all cadres. In a recent production competition, two advanced units and more than thirty production activists were rewarded.

    部队积极养猪
    中国人民解放军济南地区部队政治部今年大量养猪，按现在圈存的头数计算，平均一点九人有一头猪。
    党委重视，首长带头，大家动手，是他们能够大量养猪的主要原因。一年来，机关党委和各支部都把养猪等生产列入工作日程，专设生产委员。党小组不断开会研究保证生产任务的完成。政治部首长何柱成少将，亲自垒猪圈，积饲料，每次生产会议都参加，也推动了全体干部的生产热情。在最近一次生产评比中，有两个先进单位和三十多名生产积极分子受到了奖励。
