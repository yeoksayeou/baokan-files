    U.S. Aggressive Activities in Africa

    Editor's Note: The British "Economist" published a commentary by its special correspondent on September 12, revealing the large-scale intrusion of American forces into Africa and Britain's concerns about American expansion. The following is a translated excerpt:

    The U.S. Department of Commerce has established a high-level committee of business leaders to advise on investment in Africa, just as the State Department has established an African Affairs Division and the Army Quartermaster Corps is conducting long-term research on the central African region.

    It is said that about two hundred American companies have interests in Africa. The United States gives Africa some economic "aid" and has established some political connections. The World Petroleum Congress received a report that investigations showed that Africa's oil reserves have increased twentyfold in the past four years, with 3.5 billion barrels in the Sahara alone, perking up businessmen's ears.

    At the same time, American journalists traveling in Africa are doing their best to introduce the strange and unusual circumstances of Africa to readers in terms familiar to Americans. In the magazine field, two monthly magazines and one weekly magazine have recently devoted entire issues to reporting on various aspects of the African continent.

    Major American foundations have personnel and funds in Africa. The Carnegie Corporation has assisted the London-based International African Institute's publishing program and has set aside funds to study the history of Benin for five years. Since 1928, it has spent more than $3 million in South Africa and colonial areas alone.

    In March of this year, the Carnegie Corporation provided two major grants, one for the Nigerian library and the other for a survey of higher education in Nigeria in cooperation between Britain and Nigeria. The Ford Foundation is investigating elementary education in Nigeria, while the Rockefeller Foundation has been studying yellow fever in Nigeria and Uganda for several years. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund has established a branch in Ghana, advising Africans in Ghana and Nigeria on obtaining funding and other financial assistance. The Twentieth Century Fund is about to publish its three-year African study report on sub-Saharan Africa.

    Some voluntary service committees have less money than foundations, perhaps for this reason, their goals are quite different. For example, the "African Studies Association," with two hundred members, has opened a center for various academic investigations; the American Committee on Africa is mainly concerned with political interests; the American Society of African Culture is an organization of American black intellectuals.

    The attitudes of Britain and the United States are not as different as they appear on the surface; the main purpose of both countries is to develop the political, social and economic strength of African countries.

    But even with these views, this does not mean that no one looks at the aspirations of Africans from the perspective of 1776, and no one is trying to end British rule at any cost.

### 美国在非洲的侵略活动

专栏：外论摘要

    美国在非洲的侵略活动
    编者按　9月12日的英国“经济学家”发表了该刊特派记者的述评，透露美国势力大规模侵入非洲的情况和英国对美国扩张的担忧。现摘译如下：
    美国商务部成立了一个对非洲投资谘询的高级商界人士委员会，正像国务院成立非洲事务司和陆军军需部对非洲中部地区进行长期的研究工作一样。
    据说约有二百家美国公司在非洲拥有利益。美国给予非洲一些经济“援助”，而且建立了某些政治联系。世界石油大会接到报告说，调查的结果表明，非洲的石油储藏量在过去四年内增加了二十倍，仅撒哈拉一地就有三十五亿桶，商人的耳朵都竖起来了。
    同时，在非洲旅行的美国新闻记者也尽力把非洲的奇奇怪怪的情况用美国人所熟悉的字句介绍给读者。在杂志方面，两家月刊和一家周刊最近都曾以整整一期报道非洲大陆各方面的情况。
    美国各大基金会在非洲都设有专人和存有款项。卡尼基公司曾协助伦敦的国际非洲人学会的出版计划，并曾拿出一部分款项用五年的时间研究贝宁历史，它在1928年以来，仅在南非和殖民地区就用了三百多万美元。
    卡尼基公司在今年3月提供了两大赠款，一部分是供尼日利亚图书馆之用，另一部分是在英国和尼日利亚合作之下，调查尼日利亚的高等教育。福特基金会正在调查尼日利亚的初等教育，而洛克菲勒基金会数年内一直在研究尼日利亚和乌干达的黄热病。洛克菲勒兄弟基金会在加纳成立分处，向加纳和尼日利亚的非洲人就取得资金和其他的财政援助提供意见。二十世纪基金会即将发表它在撒哈拉以南的三年非洲研究报告。
    一些义务性质的服务委员会的钱没有基金会多，或许就是为了这个原因，它们的目标完全不同。例如，拥有两百会员的“非洲研究协会”开设了一个进行各种学术调查的中心；美国的非洲委员会主要关心政治利益；美国的非洲文化协会是一个美国黑人知识分子的组织。
    英国和美国的态度并不像外表那样不同；两国的主要目的就是发展非洲国家的政治、社会和经济力量。
    可是纵然有这些看法，这并不意味着没有人再从1776年的角度看待非洲人的愿望，没有人企图不惜一切牺牲急于结束英国的统治。
