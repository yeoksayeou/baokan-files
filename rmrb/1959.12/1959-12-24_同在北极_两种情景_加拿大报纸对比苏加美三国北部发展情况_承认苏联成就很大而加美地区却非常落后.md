Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, December 22nd (TASS): Recent articles in Canadian newspapers have compared the development of Canada's far north with that of the Soviet Arctic, and concluded that in the Arctic, "Canadians and Americans are at least twenty-five years behind the Soviets."

For example, "Maclean's" bi-weekly magazine wrote that the current ratio of people working in the Arctic in Canada and the Soviet Union is one to five hundred; Canada has only cultivated one thousand acres of land north of the 60th parallel, while the Soviet Union has cultivated one million acres. The magazine wrote that "this difference will be even greater after the current Soviet Seven-Year Plan is implemented." The magazine's editor, Fraser, who visited the Canadian Arctic, found that the area remained "as primitive" as when it was first discovered.

Another editor of the magazine, Newman, speaking about the difficult living conditions of the people in the Canadian Arctic, said, "Sixty-four percent of Canadian Eskimo children cannot attend school, and only sixteen out of two thousand five hundred Eskimo children attend secondary school." He wrote that the living conditions of most Eskimos and their families are very poor. He said, "One-quarter of all Eskimo infants who are born alive die in their first year. The average lifespan of Canadian Eskimos is only twenty-nine years."

Newman emphasized that the Soviet Eskimos live in houses built almost entirely at public expense. They work with Russian miners and fishermen, and they are all literate.

"Canadian Business" magazine pointed out that the actual situation in northern Canada proves that "in any aspect, in every area, the Russians have surpassed us in achievements."

　　同在北极  两种情景
    加拿大报纸对比苏加美三国北部发展情况  承认苏联成就很大而加美地区却非常落后
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社渥太华22日讯：最近加拿大报纸刊载的一些文章把加拿大极北部地区的发展同苏联北极地区作了比较，并且得出结论说：在北极方面，“加拿大人和美国人至少比苏联落后二十五年”。
    例如，“麦克林”半月刊写道，目前加拿大和苏联在北极工作的人的比数是一比五百；加拿大在十六纬度圈以北只开垦了一千英亩土地，而苏联则开垦了一百万英亩。这家杂志写道，苏联“目前的七年计划实现以后，这种差别就更大了”。这家杂志的编辑弗雷泽曾去过加拿大的北极地区，他发现这个地方仍然像它刚被发现时“那样原始”。
    该杂志的另一位编辑纽曼在谈到加拿大北极地区人民的生活艰苦状况时说，“百分之六十四的加拿大埃斯基摩族儿童不能入学，两千五百名埃斯基摩儿童中只有十六人上中等学校。”他写道，大多数埃斯基摩人和他们的家庭生活条件十分恶劣。他说，“在所有出生后活着的埃斯基摩族的婴儿中有四分之一在头一年中就死了。加拿大埃斯基摩人的平均寿命只有二十九岁”。
    纽曼着重指出，苏联的埃斯基摩人居住在差不多全用公费建造的房屋中。他们同俄罗斯矿工、渔民一起工作，他们全都识字。
    “加拿大商业”杂志指出，加拿大北部的实际情况证明，“在任何方面，在每一个地区，俄国人在成就上都赶过了我们。”
