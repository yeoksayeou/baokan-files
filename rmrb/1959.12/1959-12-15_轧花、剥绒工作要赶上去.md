    Catch Up on Cotton Ginning and Linting
    The characteristics of this year's cotton picking and purchasing work are large volume, concentration, and rapid progress. This requires that cotton ginning and linting work quickly keep up, so as to supply the purchased cotton to the textile industry in a timely manner.
    Encouraged by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of workers in cotton ginning factories across the country have greatly opposed right-leaning tendencies, greatly boosted their energy, and vigorously engaged in mass movements centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, achieving great results in a very short period of time. As of the end of November, the amount of cotton processed increased by 72% compared to the same period last year, and the amount of short lint removed increased by two and a half times compared to the same period last year. The processed lint cotton is also of good quality and meets the requirements of the textile industry.
    The current problem is that cotton ginning still lags behind purchasing, and linting still lags behind cotton ginning. By the end of November, the lint cotton processed accounted for only 50% of the purchased amount, and the cotton seeds that had been delinted accounted for only about 25% of the cotton seeds that had been ginned.
    How to solve this contradiction?
    First, we must find ways to increase the operating rate of cotton ginning and linting equipment. Currently, some of the cotton ginning machines and linting machines in some cotton-producing areas have not yet been started. A major reason for this situation is that short-distance transportation work in some areas has not kept up, and seed cotton has not been transported to cotton ginning factories in a timely and large quantity, resulting in a few cotton ginning factories being unable to produce normally due to insufficient raw materials. It is hoped that these areas will pay attention to this issue, promptly organize forces from all aspects, rationally arrange labor, vigorously carry out short-distance transportation, and quickly transport seed cotton to cotton ginning factories.
    For cotton ginning and linting equipment that has already been started, we must vigorously improve production efficiency. The key lies in adhering to putting politics in command, fully mobilizing the masses, carrying out technological innovation movements, and carrying out socialist labor competitions. Nanyang Cotton Ginning Factory in Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, has deeply carried out red flag competitions, promptly commended advanced units and model individuals, and the enthusiasm of all employees is high, so cotton ginning and linting have both overfulfilled their plans, and the quality has also been continuously improved. This is a very good example.
    In order to increase cotton ginning capacity, it is necessary to implement the policy of "walking on two legs," paying attention to saw ginning in state-owned factories and roller ginning in people's communes. Party committees at all levels in Sichuan Province have paid attention to organizing commune ginning, and commercial departments have helped communes arrange labor and assist communes in converting manual cotton ginning machines into power and hydraulic machines, greatly improving production efficiency. At present, the amount of lint cotton processed by the commune's roller gins in this province accounts for 90% of the total processing amount. It is hoped that all localities will pay attention to this force.
    All localities should pay attention to achieving a comprehensive leap forward in high yield, high quality, low cost, and safe production in cotton ginning and linting work. We must not neglect quality and conservation because of simply pursuing quantity. Because this year's cotton purchase volume is large and the time is concentrated, we should pay more attention to strengthening storage and ensuring safety. We must carry out a safe production movement with "prevention first," and resolutely prevent fire, theft, and mildew.
    All localities should pay attention to the simultaneous progress of cotton ginning and linting. Cotton short lint is an important raw material for the chemical industry and also an important export commodity. In order to make the linting work develop rapidly, commercial departments at all levels should focus on both cotton ginning and linting, and earnestly achieve ginning, linting, and oil extraction at the same time. We must grasp the production of short lint early, tightly, and meticulously, and promptly solve the problems in the linting work.

### 轧花、剥绒工作要赶上去

    轧花、剥绒工作要赶上去
    今年棉花采摘和收购工作的特点，是量大集中，进度很快。这就要求轧花、剥绒工作迅速跟上去，以便及时把收购到的棉花供应给纺织工业部门。
    全国广大地区轧花厂的职工，在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，大反右倾，大鼓干劲，大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，在很短的时间内取得了很大的成绩。截至11月末加工的棉花，比去年同期增长72％，剥短绒数量比去年同期增加二倍半。加工成的皮棉，质量也很好，符合纺织工业的要求。
    现在的问题是：轧花还落后于收购，剥绒还落后于轧花。到11月底止，加工出来的皮棉仅占收购量的50％，剥过绒的棉籽仅占轧出来的棉籽的25％左右。
    怎样解决这一矛盾呢？
    首先要设法提高轧花、剥绒设备的开工率。现在有些产棉地区的轧花机和剥绒机，有一部分还没有开动起来。造成这种情况的一项主要原因，是有些地区短途运输工作没有跟上，籽棉没有及时大量运到轧花厂，结果少数轧花厂因原料不足，不能正常生产。希望这些地区重视这一问题，及时组织各方面的力量，合理安排劳动力，大力开展短途运输，迅速把籽棉运到轧花厂。
    已经开动的轧花、剥绒设备，要大力提高生产效率。关键在于坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，开展技术革新运动，开展社会主义劳动竞赛。江苏省启东县南阳轧花厂深入开展红旗竞赛，及时表扬先进单位和模范人物，全体职工的干劲高昂，因此轧花、剥绒都超额完成了计划，质量也不断提高。这是一个很好的榜样。
    为了增加轧花力量，要贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，既重视国营厂锯齿机轧花，又重视人民公社皮辊机轧花。四川省各级党委都注意组织公社轧花，商业部门帮助公社安排劳力，协助公社把人力轧花机改制为动力和水力机，大大提高了生产效率。目前，这个省公社的皮辊机加工皮棉的数量，占总加工量的90％。希望各地都能重视这支力量。
    各地在轧花、剥绒工作中，要注意高产、优质、低成本、安全生产全面跃进。不能因为单纯追求数量，而忽视质量和节约。由于今年棉花收购量大而且时间集中，更要注意加强保管，保证安全。要开展以“预防为主”的安全生产运动，切实防火、防盗、防霉。
    各地要注意轧花、剥绒同时并进。棉短绒是化学工业的重要原料，也是重要的出口物资。为了使剥绒工作迅速开展起来，各级商业部门应该一手抓轧花，一手抓剥绒，切实做到随轧花、随剥绒、随榨油。对短绒生产要抓早、抓紧、抓细，及时解决剥绒工作中的问题。
