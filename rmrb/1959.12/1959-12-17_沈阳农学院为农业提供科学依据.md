Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 16th: Teachers and students of Shenyang Agricultural College are conducting scientific research closely integrated with production practice, which has played a certain role in promoting production.

The high-yield technology experiments on crops such as wheat, corn, sorghum, rice, upland rice, sugar beets, and potatoes conducted by teachers and students of the Agronomy Department have not only accumulated a set of experiences in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," but also conducted theoretical analysis on this basis, providing an important basis for Liaoning Province to formulate high-yield technical measures for the above-mentioned crops. Professor Yang Shouren of this department, through distant hybridization breeding methods, used the famous early-maturing indica rice "Nante No. 1" from southern China and the early-maturing japonica rice "Jiaba" from Japan to cultivate a new variety. The results of trial planting of this new type of rice seed in more than ten provinces and cities this year show that it has the advantages of strong growth, large panicles and many grains, good rice quality, and good disease resistance. The "Shennong No. 2" tomato cultivated by teachers of the Horticulture Department to solve the shortage of early spring vegetables in Liaoning Province has the advantages of early maturity, large fruit, high yield, and suitability for dense planting. It is currently one of the best early-maturing tomato varieties in Liaoning Province and has now been promoted in production.

Teachers have also explored long-term theoretical issues and cutting-edge science in production. The research on "converting spring wheat to winter wheat" conducted under the leadership of Professor Gong Jidao has now obtained winter-type materials of eight spring wheat varieties such as "Cooperation No. 4" and "Minnesota 2761," which have transformed these spring wheat varieties, which originally could not overwinter in the Shenyang area at all, into winter wheat that can completely overwinter in the open field, and in terms of cold resistance and high yield, they far exceed the "Da Qingzhi" winter wheat varieties currently used in production. They have also applied cutting-edge scientific technologies such as ultrasonic waves and ionizing radiation to agriculture and have achieved preliminary results.

    沈阳农学院为农业提供科学依据
    新华社沈阳16日电　沈阳农学院师生们密切结合生产实际开展科学研究，对推动生产起了一定的作用。
    这个学院农学系师生合作进行的小麦、玉米、高粱、水稻、陆稻、甜菜和马铃薯等农作物的丰产技术试验，不仅积累了一套贯彻农业“八字宪法”的经验，还在这个基础上进行了理论分析，为辽宁省制定上述作物的丰产技术措施，提供了重要依据，这个系杨守仁教授通过远缘杂交的育种方法，用我国南方著名的早熟籼稻“南特号”和日本早熟粳稻“嘉笠”杂交，培育出新的品种。这种新型稻种今年在十多个省市试种结果，表现出生长力强、穗大粒多、米质优良、抗病性好等优点。园艺系教师为解决辽宁省早春蔬菜缺少培育出的“沈农二号”番茄，有早熟果大、多产和适宜密植的优点，是辽宁省目前早熟番茄中一个最好的品种，现在已经在生产中推广。
    教师们对在生产上有长远性的理论问题和尖端科学也进行了探讨。在龚畿道教授领导下进行的“春麦转化冬麦”的研究，现在已取得了“合作四号”、“明尼二七六一”等八个春麦品种的冬性材料、使这些原来根本不能在沈阳地区越冬的春麦、转化为完全可以在露地过冬的冬麦，并且在抗寒性、高产性等方面都远远超过目前在生产上所应用的“大青芷”冬麦品种，他们还把超声波、电离辐射等尖端科学技术应用到农业上去，并且取得初步成果。
