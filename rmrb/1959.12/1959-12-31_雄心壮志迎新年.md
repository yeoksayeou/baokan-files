Embracing the New Year with Lofty Aspirations
    Make Great Resolutions, Establish Great Ambitions
    "The head can be severed, blood can flow, but the will cannot be bent." The will spoken of here is the goal of struggle. To steadfastly strive for the great goal of communism is the lofty aspiration of the proletariat. "Will is the commander of spirit."
    Indeed, wills are great and small. Different wills result in different spirits.
    One kind of will is the revolutionary will of the petty bourgeoisie. The struggle goal of such idealists, at best, is nothing more than "thirty acres of land, an ox, a wife, children, and a warm brick bed." During the democratic revolution, in order to achieve this goal, they also engaged in revolution and became fellow travelers of the proletariat. After the victory of the democratic revolution, their "will" was realized, and they became "complacent," no longer wanting to "cross the line." Compared with the communist will, how small is this democratic revolutionary will!
    Another kind of will that is "like-minded" with this is the individualistic will. Such people engage in revolution and construction, invariably and repeatedly, only for the sake of "self." If it is beneficial to "me," the enthusiasm will "arise spontaneously." If it is not beneficial to "me," they will "work or not, it's all the same," feeling discouraged and complaining of being "unsuccessful."
    There is also a type of person who may be called "will-less," because they are "sliding wherever the watermelon rind takes them." They show fatigue and slackness towards the revolutionary cause. They do not step on difficulties but rather hang them on their lips. Since the driving force for their "sliding" is still individualism, they slide further and further away from socialism and must "slide" into the capitalist quagmire.
    Such different wills, in the final analysis, are due to different worldviews. Proletarian revolutionaries, starting from the proletarian revolutionary worldview, generate the great ambition to struggle for communism. The individualistic will is precisely a reflection of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois worldviews. Those who are full of food all day long and have nothing to do represent the spiritual state of the declining bourgeoisie. People cannot help but ask: Why is it that some comrades, as revolutionary cadres and Communist Party members, after long-term education and revolutionary struggle by the Party, have not even resolved the issues of revolutionary ambition and worldview? In fact, this is not surprising. Because people's aspirations are a reflection of objective existence. At present, there is still a complex class struggle in our country. Therefore, the consciousness of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will inevitably corrode the wavering comrades in our revolutionary ranks. This is an objective influence. However, the problem does not stop there. Why are many comrades not affected in the same environment? It can be seen that objective influence is one thing, and subjective effort is another. External causes work through internal causes. The reason why some comrades are easily influenced by the petty bourgeoisie or even the declining bourgeoisie is either because they themselves come from non-proletarian backgrounds and lack self-ideological transformation, or because they do not pay attention to personal ideological cultivation and lack "antitoxins" in their thinking. Therefore, to establish the lofty ambition of struggling for communism, one must "change one's bones" to transform one's worldview and change one's position. At this moment of opposing rightism, boosting morale, and implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, it is the best time to settle one's thoughts, transform one's worldview, and establish lofty ambitions. Opportunity knocks but once. Those without great ambitions are advised to make a decisive decision and take care of themselves.

    It is Time to Establish Great Ambitions
    There are all kinds of ambitions. Goujian, King of Yue, tasted gall while sleeping on brushwood, striving arduously to avenge the destruction of his kingdom—this is ambition. Xiang Yu, upon seeing Emperor Qin Shi Huang, said, "He can be replaced"—this is ambition. Capitalists think every day about how to strengthen exploitation, swallow or squeeze out other people's factories, and expand their own factories—this is also ambition. "Thirty acres of land, an ox, a wife, children, and a warm brick bed"—this is also ambition... It is impossible for a person to have no ambition; nor will they have no ambition. The question is what kind of ambition is established.
    What we must establish is the great ambition of the proletariat. What is the great ambition worthy of our proletariat? This is to change the impoverished and backward face of the motherland, to change the face of the earth. This task, apart from the proletariat and the working people under the leadership of the proletariat, no one has the ability (nor is willing) to shoulder. With such a great ambition, people will accomplish many earth-shattering achievements. Barren mountains have become orchards, poor teams have caught up with rich teams, factories have been built on flat ground, and rivers have appeared in high mountains. There are "sky-managing groups" here and sea-taming heroes there.
    Look, among us, the people who have established great ambitions number more than ten thousand! However, among us, there are also some comrades whose enthusiasm is not high enough and whose potential has not been brought into play. This situation cannot continue. The situation puts forward an urgent request to us: everyone must come and establish great ambitions.
    Some people do not dare to establish great ambitions because they are afraid that establishing great ambitions will turn them into individualists. Indeed, some people establish individualistic "great ambitions." They only think about what kind of fame they want to make in order to achieve the goal of gaining both personal fame and wealth. In the eyes of Marxists, this kind of ambition is not only extremely small but also despicable and will definitely run into a wall. We must oppose such "ambitions." However, the first way to overcome individualism is precisely to establish great ambitions—to establish the great ambitions of the proletariat.
    "The sea is wide for fish to leap, the sky is high for birds to fly." The leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the socialist system, are very favorable conditions for us to realize our great ambitions. Every industry and every profession can establish great ambitions, and men, women, old, and young can all establish great ambitions. Because every job position and every individual is closely related to building socialism. Is the job position ordinary? Slicing meat or peeling shrimp shells can be considered ordinary, right? However, Wang Erzhu in Guangzhou used two minutes and ten and a half seconds to slice a pound of shredded meat, and Guo Liying used one minute and eighteen and three-tenths seconds to peel half a pound of shrimp shells. Their achievements are not ordinary. In their minds, speeding up the slicing of meat and peeling of shrimp shells means speeding up the construction of socialism.
    A year is about to pass, and a new and more beautiful year is about to arrive. Such a day is the best day to rethink one's aspirations seriously and to resolve to establish great ambitions!

### 雄心壮志迎新年

专栏：报刊文摘

　　雄心壮志迎新年
    下大决心　立大志气
    “头可断，血可流，而志不可屈”，这里所说的志，就是奋斗目标。坚定的为共产主义伟大目标而奋斗，就是无产阶级的雄心大志。“夫志，气之帅也”。
    是的，志，有大有小。志不同，气亦各异。
    有一种志，是小资产阶级的革命之志，这般志士的奋斗目标，说到顶，也不过是“三十亩地一头牛，老婆孩子热炕头”。在民主革命时期，他们为了实现这个目标，也曾经干过革命，成为无产阶级的同路人。而在民主革命胜利后，他们的“志”实现了，于是就“踌躇满志”起来，再不想“越雷池一步”。这种民主革命之志与共产主义之志相较，该是何等的渺小！
    和这种“志同道合”的另一种志，就是个人主义之志。这种人闹革命、搞建设，万变不离其宗，反来复去，只是为了个“我”字。对“我”有利的，干劲就“油然而生”，对“我”不利的，就来个“干不干，二斤半”，心灰意懒，埋怨“不得志”。
    还有一种人不妨称它为“无志”，因为他们是“脚踏西瓜皮，滑到哪里算哪里”，他们对革命事业表现疲沓、松懈，他们不是把困难踩在脚底下，而是把困难挂在嘴边上。由于作为他“滑”的动力仍是个人主义，那他就越滑离社会主义越远，一定要“滑”到资本主义泥坑中去。
    志如此之不同，归根结蒂，是由于世界观的不同。无产阶级革命家从无产阶级革命的世界观出发，就产生了为共产主义而奋斗的大志。个人主义之志，也正是资产阶级和小资产阶级世界观的反映。饱食终日，无所事事者，更是代表着没落的资产阶级的精神状态。人们不仅要问：为什么有些同志身为革命干部、共产党员，又经过党的长期教育和革命斗争的锻炼，连革命的志向，世界观的问题都没有解决呢？其实，这并不奇怪。因为人的志向是客观存在的反映。当前我国仍然存在着复杂的阶级斗争。因此，资产阶级和小资产阶级的意识必然腐蚀我们革命队伍中不坚定的同志。这是客观的影响。但是，问题不止于此。为什么在同一个环境中，很多同志却未受影响呢？可见，客观的影响是一回事，主观的努力又是一回事。外因通过内因起作用。有些同志所以容易受小资产阶级甚至没落的资产阶级的影响，或者是由于他本身就是出于非无产阶级，而又缺乏自我思想改造，或者是由于他不注意个人思想修养，在思想上缺乏“抗毒素”。因此，要确立为共产主义奋斗的雄心大志，就必须“脱胎换骨”改造自己的世界观，改变立场。当此反右倾、鼓干劲，贯彻八届八中全会精神的时刻，正是清算自己的思想，改造自己的世界观，树立雄心大志的最好时机。机不可失，时不再来，奉劝无大志者当机立断，好自为之。（摘自12月23日辽宁日报王世林、那维群：“立大志展宏图”）
    立大志　此其时
    有各种各样的志。越王勾践卧薪尝胆，艰苦奋斗，要报亡国之仇，这是志；项羽见到秦始皇，说：“彼可取而代也”，这是志；资本家天天想着如何加强剥削，吞掉或挤垮别人的工厂，扩大自己的工厂，也是志；“三十亩地一头牛，老婆娃娃热炕头”，也是志；……。一个人，不可能没有志，也不会没有志。问题在于立的是什么样的志。
    我们要立的是无产阶级的大志。什么才是我们无产阶级当之无愧的大志呢？这就是改变祖国贫困落后的面貌，改变地球的面貌，这个任务，除了无产阶级和在无产阶级领导下的劳动人民之外，谁也没有本领（也不愿意）担负起来。有了这样的大志，人们就会干出许多惊天动地的业绩。荒山变成了花果山，穷队赶上了富队，平地建起了工厂，高山出现了河流，这里有“管天小组”，那里是驯海英雄。
    你看，在我们中间，立下了大志的人何止万千！但是，在我们中间，也还有这样的一些同志，他们的干劲鼓得不够足，他们的潜力还没有得到发挥。这种情况不能继续下去了。形势向我们提出了一个迫切的要求：人人都要来立大志。
    有的人不敢立大志，他们怕立大志会变成个人主义者。的确，有的人立的是个人主义的“大志”。他们只想到自己要干出一些什么名堂来达到个人名利双收的目的。其实在马克思主义者看来，这种志不但极其渺小，而且卑鄙，一定会碰壁的。我们必须反对这样的“志”。但是，要克服个人主义，第一个办法恰好就是立大志——立无产阶级的大志。
    “海阔凭鱼跃，天空任鸟飞”。党和毛主席的领导，社会主义制度，是我们实现大志的非常有利的条件。行行业业都可以立大志，男女老少都可以立大志。因为每一个工作岗位、每一个人都同建设社会主义有着密切的联系。工作岗位平凡吗？切肉丝、剥虾壳，可算平凡了吧？但是，广州的王二珠用二分十秒五的时间切完一斤肉丝，郭丽英用一分十八秒三的速度剥完半斤虾的壳，她们的成绩就不平凡。在她们的心目中，加快了切肉丝、剥虾壳的速度，意味着加快了建设社会主义的速度。
    一年就要过去了，新的，更加美好的一年就要到来了，这样的日子，是重新认真思索一下自己的志愿，并且是决心立大志的最好的日子！
