Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 17th: The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory brilliantly fulfilled its guarantee to comprehensively complete the state annual plan half a month ahead of schedule on the 15th.

This year, the factory not only comprehensively completed the state plan in terms of total output value, product output, profit delivery, and cost; at the same time, the total output value increased by about 40% compared with last year, and the output exceeded the plan by 1,053 grinding machines and instrument machine tools. Great achievements have also been made in developing towards high-level, precision, and large-scale products. The output of large machine tools has doubled compared with last year, and precision grinders have increased by 1.3 times compared with last year. Among the 20 new products successfully trial-produced this year, many are serialized, high-efficiency, and high-precision, as well as large-scale and automated new varieties.

This year, the Party Committee of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, in leading the factory's employees to achieve continuous leaps in production, has continuously armed all employees' minds with the Party's general line for socialist construction, and has carried out unremitting struggles against all kinds of thoughts that violate the general line, so that the mass movement has developed wave upon wave, step by step, persistently, consolidated, and healthily. At the beginning of the year, the factory Party organization first focused on launching a struggle against the fear of difficulty and relaxation. At that time, the supply of certain raw materials was relatively difficult, and some people doubted whether they could continue to leap forward this year. The factory Party committee organized the employees to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, enlightened the cadres to examine their slackening thoughts, and encouraged their confidence in striving for excellence. On this basis, all departments of the factory put forward specific goals. They also relied on their own efforts to overcome the difficulties of raw materials. Subsequently, the factory Party committee led the employees to overcome the phenomenon of declining quality of a few products in a timely manner, so that high output and high quality could take off together.

Since August and September, in accordance with the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the factory Party committee has continuously held meetings from the Party committee to the branches to conduct theoretical discussions, clarify the situation, and set off a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, making the production in the fourth quarter more than 40% higher than that in the third quarter, and supplementing more than 100,000 missing commodity parts in early December, guaranteeing the early completion of the national plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 17th: The Shanghai Boiler Factory, an advanced collective attending the National "Meeting of Heroes," has comprehensively completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule. This factory completed the total output value plan on December 14; completed the total output plan ninety-five days ahead of schedule; the cost of comparable products decreased by 1.84% compared with the state-prescribed indicators; and the quality of the products leaving the factory was 100% qualified after inspection. Other aspects such as product variety and profit delivery have also overfulfilled the plan. This year, the factory also trial-produced 240-ton and 120-ton power station boilers.

The factory's ability to comprehensively complete the national plan ahead of schedule is the result of their adherence to carrying out mass movements on a large scale and carrying out technological innovations. The factory Party committee promptly pointed out the weak links in production, mobilized the masses to grab topics and tackle key problems, so that production records were constantly being refreshed. In September, the factory processed a steam drum for a medium-pressure boiler in a production cycle of three and a half days, breaking the record of half a month required to process a steam drum in the past; in October, after carefully calculating and tapping potential, the employees put forward twenty technical innovation proposals, adopting the method of processing two steam drums at the same time, and as a result, completed four steam drums in three days, greatly shortening the production cycle. In order to ensure the timely and complete supply of products, the factory produced the boiler parts "furnace strips," which were originally commissioned to external factories for processing, themselves. They organized a "three-in-one combination" team of cadres, technicians, and workers, and designed and manufactured their own equipment for producing "furnace strips," ensuring the needs of boiler production throughout the year. The factory also adopted methods such as holding "Zhuge Liang meetings," technical debate meetings, and experience exchange meetings among the same types of work to solve major production keys. Over the past year, employees have put forward more than 12,500 technical innovation proposals, saving 470,000 man-hours and saving more than 4,000 tons of steel.

At present, on the one hand, all employees of the factory are seizing the last ten days of this year to increase the production of new power station boilers; on the other hand, they are preparing for next year's production to ensure a good start next year.

    一个厂用总路线武装思想　一个厂革新技术攻关键
    上海两大厂干劲饱满提前告捷
    据新华社上海17日电　上海机床厂在15日出色地实现了提前半月全面完成国家年度计划的保证。
    今年，这个工厂不仅生产总值、产品产量、上缴利润和成本，全面完成国家计划；同时，生产总值比去年增长了40％左右，产量比计划多生产了一千零五十三台研磨机和仪表机床。在向高级、精密、大型产品方向发展方面也取得了巨大的成就，大型机床比去年增长了一倍，精密磨床比去年增长了一点三倍。在今年试制成功的二十种新产品中，有不少是系列化、高效率和高精度，以及大型的、自动化的新品种。
    上海机床厂党委会今年在领导全厂职工实现生产继续跃进中，不断以党的社会主义建设总路线来武装全体职工的思想，并且同形形色色违反总路线的思想开展了不懈的斗争，使群众运动一浪高一浪，一步深一步，持久巩固和健康地发展。年初，工厂党组织首先集中地对畏难松劲情绪展开了斗争。当时，某些原材料供应比较困难，有的人就对今年能否继续跃进产生怀疑。工厂党委组织职工总结了去年大跃进的经验，启发干部检查了松劲思想，鼓舞了力争上游的信心。在这个基础上，全厂各个部门都提出了具体的奋斗目标。并自力更生，克服原材料困难。接着，工厂党委又领导职工及时地克服了少数产品质量下降的现象，使高产和优质比翼双飞。
    8、9月份以来，工厂党委根据党的八届八中全会的号召，从党委到支部不断召开会议进行务虚，认清形势，掀起了增产节约新高潮，使第四季度的生产又比第三季度提高了40％以上，并且在12月初补齐了十多万只商品缺件，保证了国家计划的提前完成。
    新华社上海17日电　出席全国“群英会”的先进集体上海锅炉厂，已经全面提前完成了今年的国家计划。这个厂在12月14日完成了总产值计划；提前九十五天完成总产量计划；可比产品成本，比国家规定的指标下降了1.84％；出厂产品经过检验，质量台台合格。其他如产品品种、上缴利润也都超额完成了计划。今年，这个厂还试制成二百四十吨和一百二十吨的电站锅炉。
    这个厂能够提前全面完成国家计划，是他们坚持大搞群众运动，开展技术革新的结果。厂党委及时指出生产中的薄弱环节，发动群众抢课题、攻关键，使生产纪录不断被刷新。9月份，这个厂以三天半的生产周期，加工了一只中压锅炉的汽包，突破了过去加工一只汽包需要半个月的纪录；10月份，职工们经过算细账、挖潜力后，提出了二十条技术革新建议，采用二只汽包同时加工的方法，结果在三天的时间里，完成了四只汽包，大大缩短了生产周期。为了确保产品及时成套供应，这个厂把原来委托外厂加工的锅炉零件“炉篾片”，自行生产。他们组织了干部、技术人员和工人的“三结合”队伍，自己设计制造了生产“炉篾片”的设备，保证了全年生产锅炉的需要。全厂还采用召开“诸葛亮会”、技术辩论会、同工种经验交流会等方法，解决重大的生产关键。一年来，职工们提出了一万二千五百多条技术革新建议，节省工时四十七万个，节约钢材四千多吨。
    目前，全厂职工一方面抓紧今年最后的十几天时间，增产新的电站锅炉；一方面为明年生产作准备，保证明年做到开门红。
