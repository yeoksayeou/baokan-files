　　As Long As You Are Bold Enough To Reform Cookware, It Is Not Difficult
　　—An Account of the Mechanization of Liujiaping Canteen in Tunchang County
　　Xie Guocheng, Lian Zhishui

    The Liujiaping Management District Public Canteen of Chengguan Town People's Commune in Tunchang County, Shanxi Province, is a large canteen that feeds 365 people. However, only six people (including management personnel) do the cooking. Moreover, they cook quickly, with a variety of dishes that taste delicious. As a result, this canteen is well-known in the southeast Shanxi region and throughout the province. The commune, county, and special district have held several on-site meetings here.

    Why can six cooks at the Liujiaping Canteen prepare food for more than 300 people? The reason is that this canteen has carried out a major reform of cooking utensils and achieved brilliant results. In the course of a year and a half, they successively created and imitated ten types of cooking tools (twelve pieces in total), including a foot-operated blower, a hand-cranked vegetable cutter, a hand-cranked noodle press, an earthen tap water pipe, dumpling molds, *窝窝头 (wōwōtóu)* molds, a thimble mill, a thimble stone roller, a *餄餎 (héle)* bed (for making a type of thick noodle), and a salt-grinding mill. For just over 140 yuan, the canteen achieved rudimentary mechanization. As a result, the canteen reduced its workforce by six cooks, twelve grain processors, and six milling livestock. This year alone, it is estimated that 4,839 labor days and 2,500 animal labor days can be saved.

     The Foot-Operated Blower Was Successfully Made

    Not long after the canteen was established, a troublesome problem arose. With over 300 people to feed and three large iron pots, three strong laborers were needed to operate the bellows for each of the three daily meals. Even so, nine out of ten meals could not be served on time. The commune members were very dissatisfied with the inability to eat on time, and the cooks complained about the hardship and the bad temper of the diners. After discovering this problem, the management district Party organization promptly convened a branch meeting, a management committee meeting, and a mass meeting, and found a solution: reform the cooking utensils. First, the carpenters, stonemasons, and skillful female cooks in the village, such as Luo Qunying and Shi Qiaohua, formed a research group of seven people to reform cooking utensils. However, these people had no knowledge of machine manufacturing. Some people said, "Manufacturing machines is something only engineers can do." Others said, "We are just uneducated peasants who have seen few machines. If we could make machines, it would be as rare as a rooster laying eggs." After hearing these comments, Xu Baolin, the Party branch secretary, repeatedly explained to everyone the principle that success can be achieved with daring thought and action, and proposed the slogan, "Think boldly, act boldly, and overcome the hurdle of reforming cooking utensils." The members of the research group gained confidence and were full of enthusiasm. Some went out during the day to visit teachers and friends, while others pondered late into the night. After a few days, Luo Qunying came up with the idea of ​​manufacturing a blower based on the principle of a windmill. The Party branch immediately sent people to help her draw a diagram and start working. After repeated experiments by Luo Qunying, Liu Guizhen, Yan Dianming and others, a hand-cranked blower was finally successfully manufactured. However, it still had shortcomings when used: it required a lot of effort and produced little wind. Therefore, everyone changed the hand-cranked to foot-operated based on the principle of a foot-operated cotton gin. This not only increased the wind power, but also made it very easy to operate. Each meal only required one person to step on it for about half an hour to cook the food.

    The news of the successful manufacture of the foot-operated blower not only caused a sensation in Liujiaping, but also caused a sensation in villages within dozens of miles. People came and went every day, either to visit the blower or to hold on-site meetings. Everyone who visited praised it.

　　Everyone Offers Ideas To Improve Cooking Utensils

    The successful manufacture of the foot-operated blower not only inspired Luo Qunying, Liu Guizhen, and others who created the blower, but also educated those who originally did not believe that old farmers could make machines. As a result, a movement of everyone offering ideas and everyone improving stoves formed. After collective suggestions, a vegetable cutter was successfully created in just one day and night. In specific experiments, because the vegetable trough was shallow and the knife was a straight blade, it wasted vegetables when cutting and could only cut slices, not shreds. Everyone conducted careful research again, and finally enlarged the vegetable trough and made three different blades for slicing, cutting into small pieces, and shredding. Since then, the hand-cranked vegetable cutter was officially born. The vegetable cutter is nine times more efficient than manual vegetable cutting. This vegetable cutter only cost four yuan for both labor and materials.

    The Encouragement of the Party Branch Secretary

    After the successful creation of the blower and the vegetable cutter, these pioneers became even more motivated, and they drew up a diagram of the noodle press.

    At first, they imitated the iron noodle presses used in restaurants and tried to create it using wood instead of iron. But they did not realize that wood could only be used for the frame and not for the roller. As a result, they put in a lot of effort, but it could not be used after it was made. At that time, some people were discouraged and thought that they had lost face. After discovering this situation, Party Branch Secretary Xu Baolin specially went to comfort them, encouraging them to persevere, overcome difficulties, and achieve success. They were deeply moved and determined to successfully imitate the noodle press. They said, "If wooden rollers don't work, we can make an iron roller at the foundry." Their words were not in vain, and the iron roller was successfully cast. After using the noodle press, it only took three people five hours to make noodles for more than 360 people, compared to the original six laborers who each spent twelve hours making noodles. The noodle press was more than four times more efficient than manual noodle making, and it also made the noodles evenly and tasted smooth. When Liu Guizhen, Yan Dianming, Huo Lanxiang, Cui Angen and others saw their imitation noodle press showing its power, they said, "We only put in a little effort to imitate the noodle press. If we talk about merit, it must be the Party branch secretary, who acted as a catalyst for us."

    Water Buckets Placed in the Exhibition Hall

    Huo Jizhen, who was specifically responsible for carrying water, saw that the canteen was using machines for blowing, cutting vegetables, and making noodles, so he also came up with an idea about carrying water. He picked up a water bucket and wanted to use a machine to replace human carrying. Later, he reflected his idea to the Party branch. Based on his opinion, the Party branch mobilized the comrades of the cooking utensil reform group to offer plans and strategies, determined to change the heavy labor of carrying water by humans in the past. Under the guidance of the Party branch, everyone researched a method of using wooden troughs to carry water instead of humans. Soon, a wooden water trough several feet long was installed. The water was drawn from the well, poured into the trough, and flowed through the wooden trough to the water tank in the canteen. Now, one and a half laborers can solve the water problem for the entire canteen in half a day, which is more than twice as efficient as carrying water by humans.

    However, this still did not satisfy everyone's requirements. Later, after many studies, a new water well was dug on the west side of the canteen, and a hygienic water mixing pool was installed next to the well. Rubber pipes were inserted into the pool, and ball bearings were installed on the windlass used for drawing water. This was a further step than the wooden trough water flow method. The water was closer to the canteen, the water pipes used rubber bands, and ball bearings were installed on the windlass, so it was light to stir, and the water could flow directly into each pot. Every day, one laborer could stir one or two hundred buckets of water in one hour, which was enough for a day's use. This was more hygienic and easier than the original wooden trough water flow method.

    Modifying Grain Processing Machines

    After the main labor in the canteen was replaced by machines, the Party branch mobilized the masses to study the modification of grain processing machines. However, after studying it over and over again, they could not come up with a good solution. Later, after hearing that the West Gate and Huazhai villages in the county had successfully modified thimble stone rollers and mills, they promptly organized people to visit. They watched the actual demonstrations, asked about the modification process, and finally drew the drawings. Before manufacturing, they also specifically mobilized the masses to put forward more than 400 rationalization proposals. Based on the skills learned from the visit and the ingenious ideas offered by the masses, the Party branch led the masses to start a new manufacturing work. After more than half a month, the thimble stone roller and mill were finally installed in a large building. The thimble mill with automatic sieves was upstairs, and the thimble stone roller with added ball bearings was downstairs. Because these two tools were more advanced than those in other places, they were more efficient to use. With two laborers and two livestock working for one day, the thimble mill could grind 1,500 catties of corn, and the thimble stone roller could roll 2,500 catties of rice. This was twice as efficient as the improved stone rollers and mills in other places, and more than thirteen times as efficient as the old-fashioned stone rollers and mills. Because the thimble mill and the thimble stone roller were successfully manufactured at the same time, the commune members called them "twin sisters."

    A New Battle Begins

    The cooking utensils in the Liujiaping Public Canteen have achieved rudimentary mechanization, and the canteen is getting better and better.

    Recently, they have new plans. They plan to complete water-powered stone rollers, water-powered mills, vegetable washing machines, dumpling wrapping machines, and rice serving machines in the first quarter of 1960, truly achieving one cook being able to cook for 130 people.

　　只要大胆干炊具改革并不难
　　——记屯长县刘家坪食堂实现土机械化的经过
　　谢过成  连治水
    山西屯长县城关镇人民公社刘家坪管理区公共食堂，是一个有三百六十五人吃饭的大食堂，但是只有六个人做饭（包括管理人员），而且他们做得快，饭菜花样多、味道香。因而这个食堂在晋东南地区、在全省很有名声。公社、县、专区，在这里召开过好几次现场会议。
    为什么刘家坪食堂六名炊事员，能作出三百多人的饭呢？原来是这个食堂大闹炊具改革，取得了辉煌的成果。在一年半的过程中，先后创制和仿制成功了脚踏吹风机、手摇切菜机、手搅压面机、土自来水管、圪瘩模、窝窝模、顶针磨、顶针碾、餄餎床、粉碎食盐磨等十种十二件炊事工具，只用了一百四十多元钱，就使食堂实现了土机械化。食堂因此减去了六个炊事员、十二个粮食加工员、六头碾面牲口。今年全年可节省人工四千八百三十九个、畜工两千五百个。
     脚踏吹风机制成了
    食堂成立不久，发生了一个使人头疼的难题。三百几十个人吃饭，三口大铁锅，一天三顿饭就得三个强劳力拉风箱。就这样，还是十顿有九顿不能按时开饭。社员对不能按时吃饭很有意见，炊事员嚷嚷受罪又受气。管理区党组织发现这个问题后，及时召开了支部会、管理委员会和群众会，找到了解决这一问题的门径：改革炊具。首先把村里的木匠、石工和心灵手巧的女炊事员罗群英、史巧花等七人组成了一个改革炊具研究组。但是，这伙人对制造机器都不摸底。有人说：“制造机器是工程师才能干的事。”还有的说：“咱这老粗连机器都见的少，要能造出机器，就好比公鸡下蛋，太稀罕了。”党支部书记徐保林听到这些反映后，向大家反复说明了敢想敢干就能成功的道理，并提出了“大胆想大胆干，闯过改革炊具关”的行动口号。研究小组的人增强了信心，干劲十足。有的人白天出外访问师友，有的黑夜苦思苦想。没有几天，罗群英按风车的原理，想出了制造吹风机的办法。党支部立即派人帮她绘图并动手做。经过罗群英、刘贵珍、阎电明等七个人三番五次的试验，终于制造成功了手摇吹风机。但是使用时还是有缺点：出力大，风力小。于是大家又按脚踏弹花车的原理，改手摇为脚踏。这样，不仅风力大，而且在操作上非常省劲。每做一顿饭只用一个人脚踏半个钟头左右，就能把饭做熟了。
    脚踏吹风机制造成功的消息传出后，不仅轰动了刘家坪，而且把方圆几十里的村庄都轰动了。每天人来客往，不是参观吹风机，便是召开现场会，参观的人都赞不绝口。
　　人人献计改炊具
    脚踏吹风机制造成功后，不仅鼓舞了创造吹风机的罗群英、刘贵珍等人，而且用事实教育了原来不相信老农能够造出机器的人。于是一个人人献计、个个改灶具的运动形成了。经过集体献计，只用一个昼夜，就创制成功了切菜机。在具体试验中，因为菜斗浅，刀又是齐刃，所以切起来糟踏菜，而且只能切片，不能切丝。大家又进行了仔细研究，最后把菜斗加大，并分别做了切片、切小块、切丝的三个不同刀片，从此手摇切菜机正式出世了。切菜机比人工切菜提高工效九倍。这架切菜机连工带本只花了四元钱。
    支部书记的鼓励
    创造成功了吹风机和切菜机以后，这伙闯将们的干劲更大了，他们又绘出压面机的图型。
    开始，他们仿照饭铺里用的铁压面机以木代铁进行创造。但是就没有想到，木料只能做架，不能做磙，结果费了九牛二虎之力，制成后不能使用。当时，有些人灰心丧气了，认为这下可丢了人。党支部书记徐保林发现这种情况后，特别去安慰他们，鼓励他们坚持下去，克服困难，取得成功。他们深受感动，决心要把压面机仿制成功。他们说：“木磙不行我们可以到翻砂厂做个铁磙。”他们的话没有白说，铁磙铸造成功了。压面机经过使用，由原来六个劳力每人赶十二个钟头的面，压面机只用三个人做五个钟头就能把三百六十多人的面条赶出来，比人工赶面提高工效四倍多，而且还赶得均匀，吃着顺口。当刘贵珍、阎电明、霍兰香、崔安根等人，看到自己仿造的压面机大显威风时，他们说：“仿制成压面机，我们只是出了点力，要说功劳，就得数党支书，他对我们起到了催生婆的作用。”
    水担放进展览馆
    专门负责挑水的霍吉珍，眼看到食堂里吹风、切菜、赶面都用上了机器，他也就在挑水问题上打开了主意。他挑起水桶，就想用机器代替人挑。后来他把自己的想法反映给党支部，党支部根据他的意见，又发动炊具改革组的同志们献计划策，决心改变历来人挑水的重劳动。在党支部的指导下，大家又研究出了以木槽流水法代替人挑水。很快几丈长的木水槽安起来了，把水从井里打上来，倒在槽内，水就通过木槽流到食堂的水缸里。现在用一个半劳力半天工夫，就能解决全食堂的用水问题，比原来人挑水提高工效一倍多。
    但是，就这样还没有满足大家的要求。后来又经过多次研究，在靠食堂的西边新打了眼水井，井旁安了一个合乎卫生条件的水混水池，池内插上了胶皮管，打水用的辘轳安上了滚珠，这样比木槽流水法又进了一步。水离食堂近了，水管用上了胶带，辘轳安上了滚珠，因而搅着轻快，水能直接流到每个锅里，每天一个劳力一个钟头，就能搅一百几十担水，足够一天使用，比原来的木槽流水法更卫生，更省劲。
    改制粮食加工机器
    食堂的主要劳动都用机器代替后，党支部又发动群众研究改制粮食加工机器。但是研究来研究去，没想出个好的解决办法。后来听到本县的西关、华寨等村改制成功了顶针碾、磨，便及时组织人去参观。他们看了实际表演，问了改制经过，最后还绘下了图样。在制造前还专门发动群众提出了四百多条合理化建议。党支部根据参观学来的本领结合群众献出的妙计，又领导群众开始了新的制造工作。经过半个多月，终于在一座大楼里安起了顶针碾磨。楼上是顶针磨带着自动箩，楼下是顶针碾上加滚珠。这两件工具，因为比其它地方进了一步，所以使用起来效率更高，用两个劳力和两头畜力劳动一天，顶针磨能磨一千五百斤玉米，顶针碾能碾两千五百斤谷子。比其它地方的改良碾磨提高效率一倍，比原来的老式碾磨提高效率十三倍多。由于顶针磨和顶针碾是同时制造成功的，社员们都叫它两是“双生姊妹”。
    新的战斗开始了
    刘家坪公共食堂，灶具实现了土机械化，食堂越办越好，越办越巩固。
    最近，他们又有了新的打算，计划在1960年的第一季度，完成水打碾、水打磨、洗菜机、包饺子机、打饭机，真正做到一个炊事员能做一百三十口人的饭。
