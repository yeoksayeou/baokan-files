Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 1st: The people of Hunan have overcome an extraordinary drought, and following the bumper harvests of early and mid-season rice, double-cropping late rice has also achieved a bumper harvest. Double-cropping late rice, traditionally regarded as a "low-yield crop," has surpassed the yield of the bumper harvest of early rice this year, catching up with the harvest of a single season of mid-season rice. Of the province's eighty counties and cities, except for eight or nine counties such as Yueyang and Linxiang, the double-cropping late rice in other counties and cities generally reported increased production. Among the counties and cities with increased production, the vast majority of communes and teams achieved bumper harvests. Only a small number of production brigades experienced the same yield as last year or a slight decrease in production due to particularly severe drought. According to investigations in Xiangyin, Dayong, Changsha, and Liuyang counties, where the drought lasted for more than eighty days to nearly one hundred days, among 1,155 production brigades, those with increased production accounted for 92.4% compared to last year's bumper harvest of double-cropping late rice, those with the same production accounted for 5.7%, and those with slightly reduced production accounted for only 1.9%. According to preliminary statistics, among the province's 13 million mu of double-cropping late rice, there are already 42 large teams with a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin, and more than 250,000 mu of fields and plots with a per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin.

This year's drought in Hunan Province is rare in history. The fight against drought began when late rice was transplanted, with summer drought followed by autumn drought. In general, the drought lasted for eighty or ninety days throughout the province, and in many areas, the drought lasted for 120 days. More than half of the 710,000 ponds and dams in the Shaoyang and Hengyang areas and the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture were dried up by mid-September. In counties such as Shaoyang and Luxi, even the leaves on the mountains were withered by the drought. However, a bumper harvest was achieved despite the severe drought, which is fundamentally different from the situation in historical drought years. In 1934 before liberation, there was a drought year, and the record at that time was: "Hunan Province has not rained for more than a month, and the crops in the fields are withering and almost exhausted. There is no autumn harvest, wailing can be heard everywhere, and the starving are on the road." In that year, the number of disaster victims in the province reached 13,150,000. In 1945, the province only experienced a drought for 52 days, and 4 million people died of hunger and disease. Tang Zhangtao, an 82-year-old commune member of the Tangdukou Commune in Shaoyang County, vividly summarized the two different drought years in the new and old societies. He said: "In the year of Ji Hai before liberation (1899), there was a drought for 80 days, and people ate tree bark and grass roots and starved to death; in the year of Ji Hai after the people's commune (1959), there was a drought for 130 days, and the yield per mu was 780 jin, and rice piles were everywhere."

The bumper harvest in Hunan despite the severe drought was created by the people of the province under the leadership of the Communist Party. Over the past ten years, the Party has led the people of the province in building large-scale water conservancy projects, and the province's water storage capacity has increased to 13.8 billion cubic meters, which is 6.4 times that before liberation. Especially in the year after the establishment of the people's communes, the province built 41 medium-sized water conservancy projects with large water storage capacity, which is more than twice the total number of medium-sized reservoirs built in the past nine years. These water conservancy projects played a huge role in this year's drought resistance. More than 10 million mu of rice fields within the reservoir irrigation area have all achieved bumper harvests this year.

The earth-shattering drive of the people of the province in the fight against drought is an important factor in overcoming the drought and winning a bumper harvest. When the ponds and dams were pumped dry, people proposed the slogan "Find all underground water, save ten thousand mu of grain," digging wells and opening canals to find water sources in every possible way. According to incomplete statistics, more than 230,000 dams were blocked throughout the province, and more than 660,000 water sources were found, rescuing more than 3.33 million mu of rice fields that had run out of water. In Yiyang County, all the large and small rivers, except for the Zijiang River, were cut off, and the ponds and dams were dry. 610 canteens in the county had to fetch water from more than ten miles away. Under such a severe drought threat, the people of the county, encouraged by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, put forward the battle slogans "For every increment the drought increases, the drive increases tenfold" and "Fight the drought until there is no drought, ensure a bumper harvest even without rain," and tried every possible means to find water and save seedlings. Commune members throughout the county dug more than 60,000 wells, blocked 357 dams on the Zijiang River, erected 216 aqueducts, and newly opened 963 li of channels, rushing to divert water to irrigate the fields, and finally overcoming the drought.

In the fight against drought, the people's communes in various places vigorously promoted the spirit of cooperation, which played a great role in ensuring this year's late rice harvest. According to statistics from only 25 counties, more than 370,000 laborers and more than 60,000 tools were mutually supported by various communes and brigades, and more than 20,000 water sources were adjusted, irrigating more than 600,000 mu of rice fields. In many places, several communes even crossed county and provincial boundaries to jointly fight, so that some difficulties that could not be solved by one commune alone were easily solved. Five communes, including Anzao in Anxiang County, which is located on the shore of Dongting Lake, jointly organized more than 6,000 people to cut off the Hudu River in three days and nights. At the same time, with the support of the people of Gong'an County in Hubei Province, the Jingjiang South Gate was opened, raising the water level of the outer river by one meter, so that the canals were diverted to irrigate 240,000 mu of drought-stricken late rice, winning this year's bumper harvest.

    旱象增一分　干劲涨一丈　找尽地下水　救活万担粮
    湖南抗旱到底晚稻大部增产
    全省八十个县市中有七十多个县市增产
    干旱严重的公社中少数减产大多数增产
    据新华社长沙1日电　湖南人民战胜特大干旱，继早、中稻丰收之后，双季晚稻又获丰收。历来被人看作“低产作物”的双季晚稻，今年产量超过了丰收的早稻，赶上了一季中稻的收成。全省八十个县、市，除岳阳、临湘等八、九个县外，其他县、市双季晚稻普告增产。在增产的县、市中，绝大部分社、队都获得丰收，只有少数生产大队，因干旱特别严重，产量和去年相同或略有减产。据干旱时间长达八十多天到将近一百天的湘阴、大庸、长沙、浏阳等四个县调查，在一千一百五十五个生产大队中，和双季晚稻大丰收的去年比较，增产的大队占92.4％，平产的占5.7％，略为减产的仅占1.9％。据初步统计，全省一千三百万亩双季晚稻中已出现亩产千斤的大队四十二个，亩产千斤以上的片、丘共有二十五万多亩。
    今年湖南省的干旱是历史上少见的。晚稻插秧时就开始抗旱，夏旱接秋旱，全省一般地区干旱八、九十天，很多地区干旱持续一百二十天。邵阳、衡阳两专区和湘西土家族苗族自治州的七十一万处塘坝，在9月中旬有半数以上干涸见底。邵阳、泸溪等县山上的树叶都旱得开始枯黄。但是，大旱却获得了丰收，和历史上大旱年比较，情况根本不同。解放前1934年是个干旱年，当时的记载是：“湘省月余未雨，田禾枯萎殆尽，秋获全无，哀鸿遍野，饿殍载途。”那一年全省灾民达一千三百一十五万人。1945年全省只干旱五十二天，死于饥饿病疫的有四百万人。邵阳县塘渡口公社八十二岁的老年社员唐章陶生动地总结了新、旧社会两个不同的大旱年。他说：“解放前的己亥年（1899年）天旱八十天，吃树皮草根饿断肠；公社化后的己亥年（1959年）大旱一百三十天，亩产七百八十斤，到处谷子堆满仓。”
    湖南大旱获得丰收，是全省人民在共产党的领导下创造出来的。十年来，党领导全省人民大修水利，全省蓄水量增加到一百三十八亿立方米，为解放前的六点四倍。特别是人民公社化后这一年，全省建成蓄水量较大的中型水利工程四十一座，为过去九年修建中型水库总数的两倍多。这些水利工程在今年抗旱中发挥了巨大的作用。今年水库灌区内的一千多万亩稻田，都获得了丰收。
    全省人民在抗旱斗争中气吞山河的干劲，是战胜干旱赢得丰收的重要因素。塘坝车干了，人们提出
  “找尽地下水，救活万亩粮”的口号，凿井开渠，千方百计地开辟水源。据不完全统计，全省堵坝共达二十三万多处，找出水源六十六万多处，共抢救了已经断绝水源的稻田三百三十三万多亩。益阳县的大小河流，除资江外，全部断流，塘坝干涸，全县有六百一十个食堂要到十里路外挑水吃。在这样严重的干旱威胁下，全县人民在党的八届八中全会的决议鼓舞下，提出“旱象增一分，干劲涨一丈”、“有旱抗到无旱止，无雨也要保丰收”的战斗口号，千方百计，找水救苗。全县社员共计凿井六万多眼，在资江上堵坝三百五十七处，架渡槽二百一十六处，新开渠道九百六十三里长，突击引水灌田，终于战胜了干旱。
    在抗旱中，各地人民公社大兴协作之风，对保证今年晚稻丰收起了很大作用。仅据二十五个县统计，各公社大队之间互相协作支援的劳动力有三十七万多人，工具六万多件，调剂水源两万多处，共灌溉六十多万亩稻田。许多地方几个公社甚至越出县界省境联合作战，使一些非一个公社所能解决的困难，迎刃而解。洞庭湖滨的安乡县安造等五个公社联合组织六千多人，突击三昼夜，斩断虎渡河，同时在湖北省公安县人民的支援下，开放荆江南闸，使外河水位抬高一米，这样开渠引水灌溉了二十四万亩受旱的晚稻，夺取了今年丰收。
