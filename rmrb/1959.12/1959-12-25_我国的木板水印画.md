China's Woodcut Watermark Paintings
　　Guo Weiqu

　　When we walk into the Xinhua Bookstore's picture department or antique shops, we often see many people who love painting and calligraphy standing in front of the paintings of famous artists such as Mr. Qi Baishi and Mr. Xu Beihong, carefully admiring and browsing. Some of those rich in content and brightly colored attractive paintings are original works created by the artists themselves, and some are exquisite prints, among which the replicas of woodcut watermarks from Beijing Rongbaozhai are most appreciated by the audience. Ordinary reproductions printed with copperplate, lithograph, etc., always make people feel that they are printed; while the method of woodcut watermark can achieve a lifelike effect.

　　Woodcut watermark paintings have a fine tradition in our country. As Mr. Lu Xun said, "Our country's woodcut watermark paintings, from the Tang to the Ming dynasties, have had a very decent history." The invention of woodcut watermark paintings in our country can be traced back to a thousand years ago. Among the more than 20,000 scrolls discovered in the Dunhuang scripture cave, there are many exquisitely carved woodblock Buddhist paintings. Among them, the frontispiece of the "Diamond Sutra" published in the ninth year of Xiantong in the Tang Dynasty (868 AD), the "Vaisravana Heavenly King Picture" published in the third year of Kaiyun in the Jin Dynasty (947 AD), and the frontispiece of the "Treasure Chest Seal Dharani Sutra" discovered in the scripture bricks of the Leifeng Pagoda are all precious early remnants in the heritage of Chinese printmaking art.

　　With the comprehensive development of printing in the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, woodcut watermark paintings gradually expanded their scope of use. Moreover, due to the general improvement of the small-scale peasant economy in the Song Dynasty, the commercial handicraft industry at that time was further prospered, which led to the rise of vernacular literature. For a time, books and periodicals such as historical novels and operas were attached with popular illustrations, and woodcut watermark paintings have since gained the love of the broad masses of the society. At that time, the fashion of carving books prevailed in the central, local, and private bookstores. Meishan in Sichuan, a gathering place of men of letters, Jianyang in Fujian, a paper-producing area, and Bianjing and Hangzhou, formed the center of woodblock printing. The Buddhist scriptures, sub-histories, novels, operas, arithmetic books, almanacs, and medicine books published in various places all used a large number of illustrations. The woodblock printing center of the Jin Dynasty was Pingshui (now Linfen, Shanxi). In the 12th century, it published the epoch-making Jin Tripitaka. The woodcut paintings such as the "Sui Dynasty Beauty Showing Her Alluring Appearance" discovered at the site of the Blackwater City in our country are sufficient to represent the exquisite craftsmanship of woodblock watermark paintings in this period.

　　In the Yuan Dynasty, Yu's family in Jian'an published five kinds of "Zhizhi Edition Complete Illustrated Vernacular Romance of the Three Kingdoms" with pictures above and texts below, and published realistic and vigorous line drawings with a simple and powerful knife technique.

　　Woodcut watermark paintings in the Ming Dynasty continued to develop on the solid foundation of the previous generations. Furthermore, due to the participation of great painters at that time, such as Tang Yin, Qiu Ying, Gu Zhengyi, and Chen Hongshou, in the ranks of drawing prints, they cooperated with experienced woodblock carving masters, each giving play to their artistic creativity, thereby enabling woodcut watermark paintings to reach a new prosperity. At this time, the composition and woodblock carving techniques changed from the broad-knife and big-axe style of the Song and Yuan dynasties to a graceful and delicate style. For example, the "Romance of the West Chamber", "Qinglou Rhymes", "Selected Yuan Operas", "Water Margin", and "Bo Gu Yezi" published at that time are all popular works with their own styles.

　　In the mid-16th century, Hu Yuecong of Jinling created the methods of "Douban" and "Gonghua", which led woodcut paintings to a new path of color block printing. The "Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Calligraphy and Painting" and painting manuals produced by Hu established a model for Douban and color printing, laying the foundation for later woodcut New Year pictures.

　　During the Qing Dynasty, the huge productions such as "Ten Thousand Longevity Celebration Pictures" and "Southern Tour Celebration Pictures" by Qing Dynasty painters Wang Hui, Wang Yuanqi, Jiao Bingzhen, and Men Yingzhao catered to the rulers' preferences, but each illustration had hundreds of paintings, each with thousands of characters, and at the same time, the scenery was densely arranged, describing the city pavilions, mountains and rivers, social customs, and the prosperity of the city, expressing the general appearance of social life at that time. The folk carving at this time was also extremely developed. For example, the images of meritorious ministers of Lingyan Pavilion, the paintings of Taiping landscape, the Sui and Tang Dynasties, and some legendary illustrations, the meticulous and vigorous knife skills, can still inherit the mantle of the previous generations.

　　Since the middle of the Ming Dynasty, the branch of woodcut watermark paintings—woodcut New Year pictures—has gradually formed an independent style of national art rich in popular character. The production of woodcut New Year pictures began with simple printing in ink or vermilion, and then fully inherited Hu Yuecong's "Douban" color separation method, enriching the colors of New Year pictures.

　　However, after the 17th century AD, with the import of Western lead and stone printing technology, it gradually declined. Although some relatively representative illustrations appeared in the late Qing Dynasty, there was no new improvement in knife carving technology. It was not until 1933, when Mr. Lu Xun and Zheng Zhenduo jointly published the "Beiping Letterhead Manual," that woodcut watermarks once again attracted people's attention.

　　Today, under the leadership of the Party, woodcut watermark paintings, which have a foundation of realism creation for thousands of years, are moving towards a path of comprehensive development through inheritance and development. Beijing Rongbaozhai has surpassed its predecessors in some aspects of woodcut watermark painting technology. They have printed the works of painters of past dynasties and contemporary painters, and have also copied ancient Dunhuang murals, lacquerware and other patterns. The workers have also given full play to their wisdom and used fifty sets of plates and two hundred impressions to copy the "Hairpin Lady Picture Scroll" by Zhou Fang of the Tang Dynasty. It not only inherited the tradition of Chinese woodcut watermarks, but also presented a brand-new style. (Attached picture)

### 我国的木板水印画

　　我国的木板水印画
　　郭味蕖
    当我们走进新华书店图片部或文物店时，经常可以看到在名画家齐白石、徐悲鸿先生等画幅前面，站着许多喜爱书画的人，在细心的欣赏浏览。那些内容丰富、色彩鲜明的引人的画幅，有的是画家们亲手创作的原作，也有的是精致的印刷品，其中尤以北京荣宝斋木板水印的复制品，最受观众赞赏。普通用铜版、石版等印刷的复制品，总使人感到是印出来的；而木板水印的方法，却可以达到乱真的效果。
    木板水印画在我国有着优良的传统，正如鲁迅先生所说：“我国木板水印画，从唐到明，是有过很体面的历史的”。关于我国木板水印画的发明，可以追溯到一千年以前。在敦煌藏经洞中发见的两万多卷轴里，就有不少的刻制极为精致的雕板佛画。其中刊于唐咸通九年（公元868年）的“金刚经”扉画，刊于晋开运三年（公元947年）的“毗沙门天王图”，和在雷峰塔藏经砖中所发现的“宝箧印陀罗尼经”的扉画，都是我国版画艺术遗产中早期的珍贵遗存。
    木板水印画，随着宋、金、元各时代印刷事业的全面发展，逐步扩大了使用范围。又因着两宋时代社会上小农经济的普遍提高，当时的商业手工业得到了进一步的繁荣，从而兴起了平民文学。一时讲史小说、戏曲一类的书刊，都附有通俗的插图，木板水印画，从此更获得了社会上广大群众的喜爱。当时中央、地方和私人书坊，刻书的风气盛行。以文人区四川眉山，产纸区福建建阳和汴京、杭州等地，形成了雕板的中心。各地出版的佛经、子史、小说、戏曲、算书、历书、药书，无不大量的采用插图。金代的雕板中心是平水（即山西临汾），在十二世纪时，出版了划时代的金藏；在我国黑水城故址发见的“随朝窈窕呈倾国之芳容”图等木板画，都足以代表这一时期雕板水印画的精工。
    到了元代，建安虞氏刊行了上图下文本的“至治本全相平话三国志”等五种，以古朴简劲的刀锋，刊出了质实圆劲的线描。
    明代的木板水印画，在前代稳固的基础上，继续有所发扬。更因当时的大画家如唐寅、仇英、顾正谊、陈洪绶等，参与了绘制版画的行列，同富有实践经验的雕板名手，分工合作，各自发挥了艺术上的创造性，从而使木板水印画，达到了新的繁荣。这时在构图和雕板的技法上，由宋元时代的阔刀大斧，一变而为婉丽细致。如当时出刊的
  “西厢记”、“青楼韵语”、“元曲选”、“水浒传”、“博古叶子”等，都是各具风格脍炙人口的作品。
    十六世纪中叶时，金陵胡曰从又创出了“餖板”“拱花”的方法，使木板画又走上了彩色套板的新路。胡氏制作的“十竹斋笺谱”、画谱，和后来的芥子园画传，树立了餖板、套印的典范，给以后的雕板年画奠定了基础。
    清代画师王翬、王原祁、焦秉贞、门应兆等的“万寿盛典图”、“南巡盛典图”等巨制，虽然这些廊庙作品是迎合统治者的爱好，但每一部插图，多到好几百幅、每幅有千百人物，同时又繁密的布置了配景，其中描写城阁、山河、社会风物和都市繁荣的景象，表达出了当时社会生活的一般面貌。这时的民刻方面，也极发达。如凌烟阁功臣图像，太平山水图画，隋唐演义以及一些传奇插图，刀锋的缜密遒劲，也还能远接前代的衣钵。
    自从明季中叶以来，木板水印画的支系——木板年画，也在逐步形成富于人民性的民族艺术的一种独立风格。木板年画的制作，开始是单纯用墨色或朱色刷印，随后便全面继承了胡曰从的“餖板”套色法，丰富了年画的色调。
    但是，在公元十七世纪以后，随着西洋铅、石印刷术的输入，逐步衰微。清末虽然还出现了一些比较有代表性的插图，但在刀刻技术上，并没有新的提高。直到1933年，鲁迅、郑振铎先生合刊了北平笺谱，木板水印才又重新引起人们的注意。
    今天在党的领导下，拥有千百年现实主义创作基础的木板水印画，通过继承和发扬，已走向全面发展的道路。北京荣宝斋在木板水印画的技术上，有的地方已超过前人。他们刊印了历代画家和当代画家的作品，也摹印了古代敦煌壁画、漆器等图案纹样。工人们更发挥了智慧，用五十套版，二百印次板摹印了唐代周昉的“簪花仕女图卷”。不仅继承了我国木板水印的传统，而且出现了焕然一新的风貌。（附图片）
