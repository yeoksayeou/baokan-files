Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21st: The Shanghai Mining Machinery Plant, an advanced collective attending the National "Heroes' Conference," has comprehensively completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule. The total output value plan was completed seventeen days ahead of schedule; the product variety and output plans were all completed, with an additional 855 sets of mining machinery produced; the production cost from January to the end of November was reduced by 2.5% compared to the state-prescribed target; all products passed inspection, and the quality met the specified standards; the profit delivered to the state and the labor productivity plan were also overfulfilled; in addition, twenty-three new products, such as the 2.5-meter winch, were successfully trial-produced.

This year's output of the factory increased by 45% compared to last year. The factory Party committee, addressing the problem of insufficient processing equipment capacity, organized a "three-way combination" of cadres, technicians, and workers to carry out a technical innovation movement centered on improving labor productivity. They engaged in both large-scale and small-scale innovations, tapping the potential of modern equipment while also creating simple equipment, and actively learning and promoting advanced experiences. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has implemented more than 3,500 technical innovations and promoted 30 advanced experiences.

This newspaper, Qingdao, December 22nd: The Qingdao Vehicle Manufacturing Plant has comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan. As of December 15th, the factory's total output value had reached 106.67% of the annual plan; steel completed 117.57% of the annual plan; rubber-tired handcarts completed 100.55% of the annual plan; and all-wheel dump trucks completed 100.74% of the annual plan; product quality: the qualified rate of steel was 94.32%, an increase of 4.32% compared to the plan; all wheels and parts of rubber-tired handcarts and dump trucks leaving the factory met the national quality standards; costs were reduced by 1.49% compared to the plan; profits and labor productivity increased by 11.48% and 13.95% respectively compared to the plan; the safety production situation was also very good. At the same time, the factory recently also successfully smelted seven new products, including ST52 alloy steel, silicon steel, spring steel, and welding rod steel, using hot air blowing. These steels, after hot rolling, cold rolling, wire drawing, and machining, all demonstrated excellent performance.
