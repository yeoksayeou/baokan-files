    Excavate Transportation Potential to Meet the Needs of Rapid National Economic Growth
    Establish a "One-Stop" Collaborative Transportation Network
    Railways, Communications, Metallurgy, Coal, Petroleum, Grain, and Forestry Reach Agreement
    With the railway as the center, closely link factories and mines, ports, highways, shipping, handling, and receiving and dispatching units

    This newspaper reports that the seven ministries of Railways, Communications, Metallurgy, Coal, Petroleum, Grain, and Forestry recently jointly held a "One-Stop" Transportation Collaboration Conference in Beijing. After exchanging experiences and discussions, the seven ministries reached an agreement to form 378 collaborative transportation lines between production, transportation, and sales, with the railway department as the center. These include collaboration between railways and highways, railways and factories/mines, railways and forestry, railway and inland waterway shipping, railways and seaports, railway and urban transportation, as well as collaboration specifically organized between cargo owners and transportation departments for certain important materials. Some of these lines stretch for thousands of miles, while others are short distances. These collaborative transportation lines crisscross to form a nationwide collaborative transportation network.

    This "one-stop" transportation collaboration is a new experience created by the broad masses of workers during the Great Leap Forward. This experience is: the transportation departments resolutely serve production, the factories and enterprises also create favorable conditions for the transportation departments, and production, sales, and different transportation departments all guarantee production and jointly complete transportation tasks with a spirit of communist cooperation. Based on this principle, systems such as having railway freight dispatchers and dispatchers from the transportation departments of factories and mines working together in the same office and using equipment in a unified way have been established, so that railways are closely linked and closely coordinated with factories and mines, ports, highways, shipping, urban handling, and receiving and dispatching units. In this way, the role of various transportation tools can be fully utilized, the turnover of vehicles and ships can be accelerated, and transportation capacity can be improved. Therefore, the turnover time of goods in transit can be shortened, and the production departments can obtain the necessary material supplies in a timely manner.

    Although the national transportation industry has leaped forward again and again, it still cannot meet the needs of rapid national economic growth. There are more goods and fewer vehicles and ships, and the throughput capacity and loading and unloading capacity of some stations and ports are insufficient. The meeting believed that transportation collaboration is currently the latest and best way to tap existing transportation potential and solve the tense transportation situation. The work of Qinhuangdao, which pioneered the experience of transportation collaboration between stations and seaports, and other places that have promoted collaborative experience, powerfully proves this point. Originally, the Qinhuangdao station and port often failed to complete their tasks due to poor collaboration, resulting in the accumulation of goods and port congestion. After strengthening collaboration, the road and port achieved a unified heart and jointly achieved a Great Leap Forward. From January to September this year, the port's throughput increased by one times compared to last year. The station side transported 650,000 tons more coal simply by shortening the vehicle stay time. In September of this year, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications jointly held a meeting to promote Qinhuangdao's advanced experience. In just two months, the experience of transportation collaboration has bloomed and borne fruit in many places. In the past, each train from Yangquan to Shijiazhuang could only pull 2,200 tons. After the Taiyuan and Beijing bureaus strengthened collaboration, each train could pull 3,200 tons. After the Lianyungang station and port strengthened collaboration, the port's throughput increased by 30% in October. After the Dalian station and port strengthened collaboration, the port's throughput in October created the highest record since liberation, and the vehicle stay time was shortened from 18 hours to 11 hours.

    This meeting focused on introducing the experience of Qinhuangdao and the Shenyang Railway Bureau in organizing transportation collaboration, and also studied how to further promote it nationwide in the future and how to strengthen specific organizational work. (Attached picture)

    Caption: The six departments of industry, commerce, grain, railway, highway, and handling in Changli County, Hebei Province, have formed a "six-in-one" office for production, transportation, and sales, implementing a "one-stop" large-scale collaboration for production, transportation, and sales, which has significantly improved transportation efficiency. 1. The "six-in-one" office personnel study unified collaborative plans based on the current central tasks. 2. In order to improve loading and unloading efficiency and reduce labor intensity, handling workers are using the recently created "native crane" to hoist heavy stone millstones. 3. Under the leadership of the "six-in-one" office, the Zhugezhuang Quarry in Changli County has built a sloping platform of more than 160 meters long with more than 30 chute openings, which has increased the loading efficiency by 30 times. 4. Due to the "one-stop" large-scale collaboration, "door-to-door pickup and delivery" is achieved. Handling workers transport the goods to the fruit wine factory, and the inspectors are checking the goods according to the delivery note. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Xudong photo

    挖掘运输潜力，满足国民经济迅速增长的需要
    建立“一条龙”协作运输网
    铁道、交通、冶金、煤炭、石油、粮食、林业七个部达成协议
    以铁路为中心，把厂矿、港口、公路、航运、搬运和收发货物单位紧密衔接起来
    本报讯　铁道、交通、冶金、煤炭、石油、粮食、林业七个部最近在北京联合举行了
  “一条龙”运输协作会议。经过交流经验和讨论之后，七个部达成协议，以铁路部门为中心，组成三百七十八条产、运、销之间的协作运输线。其中包括铁路和公路、铁路和工厂矿山、铁路和林业之间的协作，有铁路和内河航运、铁路和海港、铁路和城市运输之间的联运协作，也有专为某些重要物资组织货主和运输部门之间的协作，有距离长达几千里的，也有短距离的。这些协作运输线纵横交错，将构成一个全国性的协作运输网。
    这种“一条龙”运输协作，是广大职工在大跃进中创造的新经验。这个经验是：运输部门坚决为生产服务，工厂企业也给运输部门创造有利条件，生产、销售和不同的运输部门之间都本着共产主义协作精神共同保证生产，共同完成运输任务。根据这个原则，建立了铁路货运调度员和厂矿企业运输部门的调度员在一起办公、统一使用设备等制度，使铁路和厂矿、港口、公路、航运、城市搬运和收发货物单位紧密衔接，密切配合。这样就可以充分发挥各种运输工具的作用，使车、船的周转加快，运输能力提高，因而可以缩短货物在中途的周转时间，使生产部门及时得到所需要的物资供应。
    全国交通运输事业虽然一再跃进，目前仍然不能满足国民经济迅速增长的需要，货多车船少，有些车站和港口的通过能力和装卸能力都很不足。会议认为，运输协作在当前正是挖掘现有运输潜力解决运输紧张状况的最新最好的办法。首创车站和海港运输协作经验的秦皇岛和其他已经推广协作经验的地方的工作，都有力地证明了这一点。秦皇岛车站和港口原来因为协作不好，双方经常完不成任务，货物积压，港口堵塞。加强协作后，实现了路、港一条心，共同大跃进。今年1至9月港口的吞吐量比去年提高了一倍，车站方面仅仅由于车辆停留时间缩短，就多运六十五万吨煤。今年9月，铁道部和交通部联合召开会议推广秦皇岛的先进经验。到现在不过两个月的时间，运输协作经验已经在许多地方开花结果。过去阳泉到石家庄每列车只能拉二千二百吨，太原、北京两局加强协作后，每列车能拉三千二百吨。连云港车站和港口加强协作后，10月份港口吞吐量提高了30％。大连车站和港口加强协作后，10月份港口吞吐量创造了解放以来最高纪录，车辆停留时间由十八小时缩短到十一小时。
    这次会议着重介绍了秦皇岛和沈阳铁路局组织运输协作的经验，还研究了今后如何进一步在全国范围推广的问题以及如何加强具体组织工作问题。（附图片）
