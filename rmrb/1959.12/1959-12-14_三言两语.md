	A Few Words

	Wild mushrooms and other fungi can only grow on the decaying matter of rotten tree trunks. But a sturdy tree, whether in fertile soil or on steep cliffs, whether in the gentle rains of the South or the harsh winds of the North, will always be deep-rooted, leafy, and full of life. If a revolutionary loses their revolutionary vigor and enterprising spirit, loses their drive and ambition to strive for the top, and becomes saturated with bourgeois habits in their personal life, then they will become like a rotten tree trunk, with wild mushrooms growing all over them.

	Puddles of stagnant water dry up and disappear most easily. Only the mountain spring, though its flow is not abundant, continues year after year, eventually flowing into a gurgling stream and then into a rushing river. As long as a person sincerely works for the people, even if their ability is not strong, as long as they work steadily and diligently throughout their life, like that spring, they will be very useful to the people's cause.
							(Yu Baichuan)

	Someone said: "I am most reluctant to read, reading gives me a headache."

	That reading and headaches are inextricably linked is not without reason.

	Reading must have political standards, which means standing firmly on the proletariat's position. Reading must have a dialectical materialist viewpoint, which means delving in, emerging out, and combining theory with practice to accept new things. Reading must have perseverance, which means progressing step by step with the ambition and determination to burn one's bridges. Lacking any one of these three, reading will not go well; lacking all three, it will be truly difficult to avoid a headache.

	Someone said: "When faced with difficulties, I am at a loss."

	"At a loss," that is exactly right. Just imagine, "when faced with difficulties," instead of trying every possible way to overcome them, you fold your arms with preconceived notions. Where will the "strategy" come from?

	To have a strategy, you must first loosen your folded hands. And loosening your folded hands must be based on a love for the socialist cause and a complete liberation of the mind.

    三言两语
    野蕈杂菌只能生长在那枯烂树干的腐体上，而壮实的大树，不管是肥土沃壤或者是峭崖陡壁，也不管是江南细雨或者是北国风沙，它永远是那样根深叶茂，生气盎盎。一个革命者如果丧失了革命的朝气和进取心，丧失了干劲和力争上游的精神，在个人生活上浸透了资产阶级的习气，那末，他就会像腐烂的树干一样，遍身都能长出野蕈来。
    泥潭积水，最容易干涸见底；只见那山涧泉眼，虽则涌量不丰，但它长年不断，终于流成潺潺清溪，汇成滔滔江河。一个人只要他诚诚恳恳地为人民做事，虽则能力不强，只要他终生不渝地踏实干，就像那泉眼一样，对于人民的事业是很有用处的。
                                  （余百川）
    有人说：“我最懒于读书，一读书就会头疼。”
    读书和头疼结了不解缘，倒也不无道理。
    读书要有政治标准，那就必须站稳无产阶级立场；读书要有辩证唯物主义观点，那就必须钻进去、钻出来、结合实际地接受新东西；读书要有恒心，那就必须循序渐进地立下破釜沉舟的志愿和决心。三者缺其一，读书读不好，倘或三者都不备，读书要想不头疼，那可真真太难了。
    有人说：“困难当头，我束手无策。”
    “束手无策”，说得太对了。试想，“困难当头”，你不是千方百计地破除困难，而是成见在胸地束起手来，“策”从哪里来呢？
    要想有策，首先必须松开你那束着的手，而松开束着的手，又必须基于热爱社会主义事业，把大脑彻底解放。
                      （胡越）
