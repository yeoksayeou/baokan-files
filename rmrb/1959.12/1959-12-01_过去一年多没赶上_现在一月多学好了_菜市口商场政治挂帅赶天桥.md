    Having Failed to Catch Up in the Past Year, They Learned Well in Over a Month:
    Caishikou Department Store Prioritizes Politics and Catches Up with Tianqiao

    (Our report) Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party branch of the Caishikou Department Store in Beijing, more than 200 employees of the store, holding high the red flag of continued leaps forward, have engaged in the competition to "Learn from Tianqiao, Catch up with Tianqiao." The entire store has seen a lively political atmosphere, and various business operations are flourishing.

    "Learn from Tianqiao, Catch up with Tianqiao" is a slogan that the Caishikou Department Store put forward a long time ago, but it had not been learned well or caught up with in the past year. Was it due to poor conditions or insufficient enthusiasm? During this study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party branch first examined this issue. During the examination, it was discovered that the past "Learn from Tianqiao, Catch up with Tianqiao" simply started from the business aspect and did not prioritize politics. This time, after the Party branch clarified the ideological situation among the employees, it carefully organized everyone to study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and mobilized the employees to present facts, reason things out, and carry out debates. Some people used to think that Tianqiao Department Store was "strong in personnel and well-equipped," had many veteran employees, high business levels, and received leadership assistance and support from all aspects, so it was impossible to "catch up with Tianqiao." Through item-by-item comparisons in the debate, it was found that the objective conditions of Tianqiao Department Store and this store were basically the same. In terms of commodity distribution, the wholesale department did not give special consideration to Tianqiao Department Store. The Party branch also compared several popular commodities distributed by the wholesale department to this store from January to September this year with those of Tianqiao Department Store, proving that the proportion of distribution to this store was larger than that of Tianqiao Department Store in these commodities. Only three kinds of small commodities were relatively fewer, but these three commodities only accounted for less than 1% of their total sales volume, which did not affect the leap forward in business. During the debate, purchasing agent Zhang Rongji also used his personal experience to educate the employees. In the past, Zhang Rongji also believed that the wholesale department gave special consideration to Tianqiao Department Store, so every time he went to the wholesale department to purchase goods, he always followed behind the purchasing agent of Tianqiao Department Store to observe. As a result, he found that not only did they not receive any special consideration, but they also ordered goods according to customer needs and handed over the details of the store's sales to the wholesale department, so that the wholesale department could also actively help organize the supply of goods. And he himself was afraid of revealing information to the wholesale department and rushed to grab fast-selling goods. Through this debate, everyone realized that the reason why Tianqiao Department Store was able to be the first to sound the clarion call for a great leap forward in the national commercial system, always hold high the red flag, and maintain its advanced position was mainly because the employees of this store, under the leadership of the Party, prioritized politics and earnestly implemented the Party's general line.

    The Party branch then began to solve the complacency and inferiority complex among the employees. The Party branch first sent people to Tianqiao Department Store to learn their advanced ideas and advanced deeds, and then reported back to everyone with specific introductions. However, some employees were unconvinced after hearing this, and some felt that they could not catch up. At this time, the Party branch organized some employees to go to Tianqiao Department Store for an on-site "study abroad" experience. Salesperson Li Shixin, who had always thought that there was nothing to learn from Tianqiao Department Store, also changed his mind after returning from his "study abroad" experience. He said: "They are proactive and enthusiastic in treating customers, which is better than us. We really need to learn from them." For those with inferiority complex, the Party branch also promptly organized employees to debate the issue of "What attitude should be adopted when business skills are not high?" Through the debate, some employees with relatively unfamiliar business skills realized that the business skills of the employees of Tianqiao Department Store were not improved all at once, but "nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it." It is precisely because their own business skills are not high that they need to "learn from Tianqiao and catch up with Tianqiao" even more. After such a series of political and ideological work, the employees' ideological understanding was improved, and the mass movement to "learn from Tianqiao and catch up with Tianqiao" was launched vigorously and steadily.

    Now, a new situation has emerged in this store. From management cadres to salespeople, everyone is concerned about the Party's general line for socialist construction and has established a political study system. They are diligent in studying and practicing business skills, often conducting business skill performances, counter experience introductions, and commodity knowledge learning, setting off a mass competition upsurge of "learning from Tianqiao and catching up with Tianqiao." In terms of enterprise management, the system of "two participations and one reform" has also been earnestly implemented, with management cadres participating in sales and salespeople participating in management. At the same time, a fixed quota management of funds is implemented, and the law of commodity sales is clarified according to the characteristics of the mall, so as to avoid out-of-stock and backlog as much as possible. Salesperson Hao Shuzhen reduced the time for bundling four bottles from thirty-eight seconds to twenty-eight seconds, breaking the city's record for bundling bottles by salespeople in the finance and trade system. Advanced worker Li Fenghua made another leap and created a new record of bundling four bottles in just twenty-three seconds. After hard work, new employee Wang Qingping increased the amount of cloth measured every thirty seconds from forty-one feet to sixty feet. Many salespeople have been praised by customers.

    过去一年多没赶上　现在一月多学好了
    菜市口商场政治挂帅赶天桥
    本报讯　北京市菜市口百货商场二百多职工，在这个商场的中共党支部领导下，高举继续跃进的红旗，在“学天桥，赶天桥”的竞赛中，全商场出现了生动活泼的政治局面，各项业务蓬勃发展。
    “学天桥，赶天桥”，是菜市口百货商场很久以前就提出的口号，但过去一年多没有学好，也没有赶上。是条件不好，还是干劲不足？在这次学习党的八届八中全会文件时，党支部首先检查了这个问题。在检查中，发现过去“学天桥，赶天桥”，只是单纯从业务方面着手，没有政治挂帅。这次，党支部摸清了职工群众中的思想情况后，认真组织大家学习党的八届八中全会的文件，并且发动职工摆事实，讲道理，开展辩论。有些人过去认为天桥百货商场“人强马壮”，老职工多，业务水平高，又受到领导的帮助和各方面的支援，因此无法“赶天桥”。在辩论中经过逐一对比，发现天桥百货商场和本商场的客观条件都基本相同，在商品分配上，批发部门对天桥百货商场也并无特殊照顾。党支部又把今年1至9月批发部门分配给本商场的若干种畅销商品，和天桥百货商场作了对比，证明本商场在这些商品方面分配的比例比天桥百货商场还大，只有三种小百货比较少些，但是这三种商品也只占他们总销货额的1％以下，并不影响业务的跃进。在辩论中，采购员张荣久还以亲身的经历，向职工们进行教育。过去，张荣久也认为批发部门对天桥百货商场有特殊照顾，所以他每次去批发部门采购时，总跟在天桥百货商场采购员的后边观察，结果发现人家不仅没有受到任何特殊照顾，还根据顾客需要进货，把商场销货情况的底子交给批发部门，这样，批发部门也能主动帮助组织货源。而他自己，则怕向批发部门交底，见快货就抢。通过这场辩论，大家认识到天桥百货商场所以能够在全国商业系统中第一个吹起了大跃进的号角，始终高举红旗，保持先进，主要是这个商场的职工在党的领导下，政治挂了帅，认真执行党的总路线。
    党支部接着又开始解决职工中的自满情绪和自卑思想。党支部先派人到天桥百货商场学习他们的先进思想和先进事迹，回来后向大家作具体介绍。但是，有的职工听了后不服气，有的则认为赶不上。这时，党支部又组织部分职工到天桥百货商场去实地“留学”。售货员李世新，一向认为天桥百货商场没什么可学的，“留学”回来后他的思想也有了转变。他说：“人家对待顾客主动热情，就是比自己好，不学真不行。”对有自卑思想的人，党支部又及时组织职工就“业务水平不高，应该采取什么态度”的问题进行辩论。通过辩论，使一些业务比较生疏的职工，认识到天桥百货商场职工的业务那样好，也不是一下子就提高的，但是“世上无难事，只怕有心人”，正是由于自己业务水平不高，才更需要“学天桥赶天桥”。经过这样一系列的政治思想工作以后，职工的思想认识提高了，“学天桥，赶天桥”的群众运动，就轰轰烈烈、踏踏实实地展开了。
    现在，这个商场已经出现了一个崭新的局面。从管理干部到售货员，人人关心党的社会主义建设总路线，并建立起政治学习制度。在业务上勤学苦练，经常进行业务技术表演、柜台经验介绍和商品知识的学习，掀起了“学天桥，赶天桥”的群众性竞赛高潮。在企业管理方面，也认真执行了“两参一改”的制度，管理干部参加售货，售货员参加管理。同时，实行资金定额管理，按照商场的特点摸清商品销路的规律，尽量做到既避免脱销，又不积压。售货员郝淑珍捆四个瓶子的时间由三十八秒降到二十八秒，打破了全市财贸系统售货捆瓶子的纪录。先进工作者李凤华一跃再跃，又创造了捆四个瓶子只用二十三秒的新成绩。新职工王清萍经过苦练，每三十秒钟量布由四十一尺提高到六十尺。许多售货员都受到广大顾客的表扬。
