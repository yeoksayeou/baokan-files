    Mountain Village Animal Husbandry Takes Flight
    One Year of the Songjiagou People's Commune in Wuzhai, Shanxi
    Wang Lintang, Zhang Changzhen, Jin Zhizhong
    The Songjiagou People's Commune in Wuzhai County, Shanxi Province, is a relatively small commune with a small population—eighty-two natural villages, with a total of only seven thousand people; in terms of area, it is a large commune—the entire territory is more than four hundred square kilometers, and it would take at least a week or so to go around the border. This commune is located on the southern foothills of the famous Guancen Mountain in northwestern Shanxi, and the entire territory is mountainous. It is truly "mountains connecting mountains, mountains surrounding mountains, you climb mountains as soon as you leave the door." On these rolling mountains, in addition to nearly 60,000 mu of gentle sloping cultivated land and more than 100,000 mu of forest, there are also grazing slopes, with lush grass, making it a natural large pasture.
    Although the people living in this area started developing animal husbandry a long time ago, they have never seen such a prosperous scene of thriving livestock as they do today. This can be seen from a few figures: In 1949, in the area now belonging to the commune, there were only more than 1,200 head of large livestock such as cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses, more than 4,000 sheep, and nearly 1,000 pigs. By 1958, the number of large livestock had increased to 2,571, an average annual increase of 13%; sheep increased to 16,200, an average annual increase of 36%; and pigs increased to 2,100, an average annual increase of 12.2%. In nine years, the total net increase in the number of large and small livestock was 14,671, an average annual increase of 23.7%. It is said that such a rate of development was already very fast, but in the first ten months of 1959, the total number of large and small livestock increased by more than 60% compared with 1958, and the absolute increase was 12,816, equivalent to 87.3% of the total net increase in the nine years from 1949 to 1958. Calculated based on the 2,108 commune members in the entire commune, each household already has an average of sixteen large and small livestock and fourteen chickens.
    The reason why the Songjiagou Commune was able to achieve such amazing development in animal husbandry in 1959, as the commune members said, is ultimately due to the establishment of the People's Commune. Now let's take a look at the specific situation of this answer.
        Dividing Herds and Slopes for Grazing
    As the saying goes: "People cannot live a day without food, and livestock cannot live a day without grass." Let's first talk about the changes in the grass slopes.
    The Songjiagou Commune has a total of 550,000 mu of grass slopes, accounting for 67% of the total area. In the past, these grass slopes were divided among thirty-one advanced cooperatives. However, the amount of grass slope owned by each advanced cooperative was different, and the speed of livestock development in recent years was also different. By the end of 1958, the large and small livestock of fourteen cooperatives accounted for only 35% of the total number of livestock in the current commune, but the grass slopes accounted for half of the total area of grass slopes in the current commune, which was not fully utilized, and the mountain grass was allowed to grow and wither on its own; however, the other seventeen cooperatives, although the grass slopes also accounted for half of the total area of grass slopes in the current commune, the large and small livestock accounted for 65% of the total number of livestock in the current commune. There were too many livestock and the grass slopes were narrow. Not only did they feel that the road was short and they could not move forward in the continued advance, but also at present, because large livestock and sheep had to graze on the same slope, and goats and sheep, castrated sheep and ewes, large sheep and lambs, and strong sheep and weak sheep could only be grazed in mixed herds, which brought great losses. The cooperatives with more livestock wanted to graze on the vacant grass slopes in other villages, but they also had their own plans: to plant trees and cultivate forests on those mountains.
    After the birth of the People's Commune in September 1958, this contradiction was solved easily. The commune not only connected the original thirty-one small advanced cooperatives into a unified whole organizationally, but also connected people's hearts together. Everyone believed that since they had become a big family, they should share weal and woe and be closely related. The villages that originally felt unable to move freely requested unified use of the grass slopes, and the people in those villages with idle slopes all said with smiles: "As long as it is beneficial to the entire commune, anything is easy to handle." According to people's wishes, the commune party committee divided the grass slopes into eight large areas, each of which was handed over to two or three management areas in close proximity for joint use. When uniformly arranging farmland, woodland, and pastureland, according to the different living habits and other characteristics of various livestock, different usage methods were determined for all grass slopes: 190,000 mu of distant slopes, steep slopes, and slopes with relatively dense thorny bushes were used for grazing goats, 230,000 mu of nearby slopes, gentle slopes, and slopes with fewer thorny bushes were used for grazing sheep, and 130,000 mu of the nearest gentle slopes, sunny slopes, and grass beaches on both sides of the river were used for large livestock and pigs. According to this division, the entire commune universally implemented the method of dividing herds and slopes for grazing. This played a great role in the rapid development of animal husbandry in 1959. Take the Huacha Management Area as an example. In 1958, nearly 900 sheep were divided into three groups, and in 1959, 1,230 sheep were divided into twelve groups, including goat groups and sheep groups; these two categories were further divided into large sheep groups, lamb groups, castrated sheep groups, ewe groups, strong sheep groups, weak sheep groups, etc. In the past, when they were grazed together, goats did not eat low-lying grass, liked to walk on distant slopes and steep slopes, and liked to nibble in thorny bushes, and sheep had to follow them, not to mention not being able to eat enough, the loss of wool was quite serious. After sheep walked on slopes with dense thorny bushes, they simply became "cotton slopes," and some sheep were often "empty on both sides." After dividing herds and slopes for grazing in 1959, the average wool production of each sheep increased from three jin in 1958 to three and a half jin, an increase of 16%. In addition, because large sheep and lambs were separated, lambs were grazed separately, walked less, and ate enough, the mortality rate dropped from 8% in 1958 to 1.2%. Castrated sheep and ewes were separated, and they grew fat and plump. Ewes were concentrated on slopes with the most lush weeds for grazing, and they grew even better, with 98% being first-class, and miscarriages were basically eliminated.
          Large-Scale Construction of Livestock Pens
    Large-scale construction of livestock pens has greatly reduced the number of livestock diseases, miscarriages, and deaths, which is an important reason for the rapid increase in livestock in the Songjiagou Commune in 1959. However, large-scale construction of livestock pens, in Songjiagou, a mountainous area, would have been difficult without the establishment of the People's Commune. The reason is that the wind and sand in this area are very strong, and the construction of livestock pens must be as exquisite in workmanship and materials as the construction of houses for people to live in; if they are built into simple earth houses, they will be covered with scars by the strong wind in the spring, and the top of the pen will be exposed to the sky, not to mention thatched sheds. However, it is indeed not easy to build solid livestock pens. In the past thirty-one advanced cooperatives, twenty-five cooperatives had no wood; seven cooperatives had only one carpenter each; and thirteen cooperatives did not even have a carpenter. Some cooperatives had wood and carpenters, but no bricks and tiles, and some cooperatives lacked funds. In short, either they were short of legs or arms, and no cooperative had everything.
    After the establishment of the commune, the first step was to transfer some people from various management areas to build a brick and tile factory and a lime factory, and then organize the forty-six carpenters and masons scattered in various villages to form a basic construction team for livestock pens. At the same time, wood worth more than 10,000 yuan was transferred from six management areas with established forests to assist the management areas lacking wood. In addition, 1,500 yuan of funds were loaned to poor management areas, and more than 12,000 workdays of labor cooperation were organized. In this way, in just one year, 1,357 old pens were renovated and 526 new pens were built. The Anzi Management Area, which had only laid the foundation for nine rooms in two years, built 36 new livestock pens in one year in 1959. The 65 new livestock pens built in the Huacha Management Area are more than twice the total number of livestock pens they had built in the past few decades. Due to the construction of livestock pens, not only did some "homeless" livestock move into new homes, but they all lived loosely and comfortably, without crowding. The old pens that were originally dilapidated and difficult to protect against the cold and heat have also been transformed from being difficult to protect against the cold and heat to being warm in winter and cool in summer after renovation. The phenomenon of livestock getting sick, having miscarriages, and dying due to wind, sun, rain, and snow has been basically eliminated.
        Universally Improved Reproduction Rate
    The great development of animal husbandry production in the Songjiagou Commune, the unified use of grass slopes mentioned earlier, the implementation of dividing herds and slopes for grazing, and the large-scale construction of livestock pens are all important reasons. However, the most fundamental reason is that the People's Commune has raised the originally very low livestock reproduction rate of some advanced cooperatives to an advanced level.
    In the past, the livestock reproduction rates of the thirty-one advanced cooperatives were uneven and varied greatly. The best was the Huacha Cooperative, which had created the experience of "hot mating" of large livestock (mating the mother animal seven or nine days after giving birth, which makes it easier to conceive) as early as 1956, and the number of calves produced each year accounted for more than 90% of the suitable-age mothers; most of the ewes could guarantee one lamb per year, and some could produce three lambs in two years, and used the methods of "double mating" (collecting semen from two rams and infusing it into the same ewe twice, with an interval of about fifteen minutes) and "re-mating" (using semen from one ram and infusing it into the same ewe twice, also with an interval of about fifteen minutes) to make the strongest ewes give birth to twins in one litter. Except for some empty pregnancies, miscarriages, and deaths, the number of lambs produced each year accounted for more than 100% of the suitable-age ewes. However, most other advanced cooperatives were difficult to compare with. In particular, the livestock reproduction rates of the fourteen cooperatives such as Heshangquan, Mapaquan, and Niuniangou were even lower. Until 1958, the average number of calves produced by their large livestock accounted for only about 40% of the suitable-age mothers, and the number of lambs produced by the sheep accounted for only 52% of the suitable-age ewes. In this way, the high was high, the low was low, and the average level was lowered. However, to be honest, even at that time, these cooperatives with relatively low livestock reproduction rates did not want to learn from advanced experience and change their backwardness. The problem was that their economic strength was weak, which bound their hands and feet. Because to improve the livestock reproduction rate, the mother animals must first have good nutrition. However, the fourteen cooperatives with the lowest livestock reproduction rates were all poor cooperatives. Until 1957, the people's food ration had to be supplied by the state every year, so how could the feed be sufficient? It was precisely because of the lack of feed and the relatively weak mother animals that a large part of the mother animals did not even go into heat and were empty for years, and many of those who were pregnant had miscarriages.
    The situation after the commune was different. Not only did the commune itself have the economic strength to help these poor management areas, but also because these poor management areas gave up part of the vacant grass slopes that originally belonged to them and handed them over to the entire commune for common use, the interests between the poor and rich management areas were more closely linked. The commune members in the relatively rich management areas also realized that even rich places cannot do without the help of others, and only by supporting each other can they become rich together. Therefore, they were all willing to help the poor management areas. In this way, extremely favorable conditions were provided for changing the backwardness of these poor management areas. The commune party committee seized these conditions and quickly launched a movement to help the poor and the advanced to help the backward throughout the commune.
    Why are poor management areas poor? The main reason is that there are few livestock (low grain yield is also directly related to the lack of livestock), especially few mother animals. Therefore, the commune first took out more than 16,000 yuan of interest-free loans from the state and nearly 20,000 yuan of public accumulation to purchase more than 120 cows, donkeys, and horses and more than 1,400 ewes from management areas with more livestock and gave them to nine poor management areas (i.e., the original fourteen poor advanced cooperatives). Those rich management areas also sold more than 1,000 ewes to these nine poor management areas, with thirty from this family and fifty from that family. But in this way, the problem became even bigger. Originally, they did not have enough feed, and now they lacked even more. Considering this, the commune transferred 70,000 jin of feed from management areas with surplus grain and lent it to these nine poor management areas. At the same time, in order to use this "east wind" of helping the poor to enable these poor management areas to get rid of poverty as soon as possible and keep pace with the rich management areas, the commune also sent seven cadres to the poor management areas to serve as party branch secretaries or management area directors, helping them implement a complete set of management systems that had been effective in the Huacha, Piandaogou, and other management areas, improve feeding and management work, establish a professional livestock team of more than 400 people, organize "red, diligent, and skillful" labor competitions, and systematically carry out political and ideological education work. This greatly stimulated the determination of the commune members in these poor management areas to strive for strength and encouraged their confidence in completely getting rid of poverty. In the great pursuit and great leap, the spirit of hard work of the commune members in the poor management areas was developed to an unprecedented height. In particular, the herders, regardless of the cold and heat, regardless of the wind and rain, were dusty all year round, wandering among the high mountains and ridges, working diligently and painstakingly. As a result, in just one year, their livestock reproduction rates quickly caught up with the level of advanced management areas, and some even surpassed the advanced management areas. For example, the sheep reproduction rate in Wujiacha "completely overturned the pot," becoming the management area with the highest reproduction rate in the entire commune. The number of lambs produced in 1959 increased sharply from 79% of the suitable-age ewes in 1958 to 180%, with 45% of the suitable-age ewes producing two litters of lambs per year, and 26% of the suitable-age ewes giving birth to twins in one litter. The total number of sheep increased from 930 last year to 1,810 in one year, the reproduction rate increased by 1.28 times, and the total number increased by 95%. The entire economic outlook of these poor management areas has also fundamentally changed. Their animal husbandry output value increased by an average of 1.3 times compared with 1958, and agriculture also turned over completely, changing from grain shortage to surplus grain. The actual income of the commune members averaged 79 yuan per person (the average for rich management areas was 90 yuan, not including the income from the commune members' household sideline occupations), an increase of nearly 70% compared with 48 yuan in 1958.
      Opened the Door to Comprehensive Production Increase
    Vigorously developing animal husbandry has brought a prosperous and abundant scene to the Songjiagou Commune. First of all, it has greatly increased grain production. Historically, this was a grain-deficient area, with a grain yield of only about 60 jin per mu. In 1957, it was only a little more than 100 jin. The state had to supply them with 500,000 to 600,000 jin of grain every year. However, in the past two years, due to the great development of animal husbandry, the land burdened by each draught animal has been reduced from more than 100 mu in the past to about 50 mu, the depth of cultivated land has been increased from 4 cun in the past to about 8 cun, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of farmland has reached more than 130 dan, and each of the five mu of basic farmland per person in the entire commune has an average of one livestock to accumulate fertilizer. Therefore, the grain yield per mu increased to 134 jin in 1958, and exceeded 200 jin in 1959. The total output reached 8.38 million jin, an average of more than 1,100 jin per person. With more grain, there is sufficient feed. In 1957, there was a total of 520,000 jin of feed, 750,000 jin in 1958, and 1.38 million jin in 1959. The people's food ration has also increased. In 1957, the average person ate 320 jin of grain, 380 jin in 1958, and 450 jin in 1959. The entire commune has changed from a grain-deficient commune to a surplus-grain commune. Last year, 1 million jin of grain was sold to the state, and this year, 1.35 million jin was sold, and 1.2 million jin was reserved.
    The great development of animal husbandry has provided more and more transportation capacity, which has also led to a sharp increase in the income from forestry and sideline occupations. This commune has many mountain products, but because most of the villages are mountain roads, only livestock can travel. When there were few livestock, these mountain products were difficult to transport out in large quantities. This year, the entire commune organized a professional transportation team of more than 300 livestock to transport mountain products and timber to the cities in large quantities, with an income of 191,600 yuan, an increase of 1.4 times compared with last year.
    What the commune members are particularly proud of is that due to the great development of animal husbandry, they can use more livestock products to support the raw materials of the national light industry and supply the people in the cities with meat and eggs. By the end of October this year, the entire commune had sold a total of 165,000 jin of pork, mutton, and beef to the state, 22,100 jin of eggs, 42,000 jin of wool, and 2,825 various hides, with a total value of more than 186,000 yuan, an increase of 2.6 times compared with the total sales value for the entire year of 1957, and an increase of 80% compared with last year.
    The rapid development of animal husbandry has greatly increased the income of the commune and its members. This year, the output value of animal husbandry in the entire commune was 395,000 yuan, an increase of more than three times compared with 1957 and an increase of 1.46 times compared with last year. Its proportion in the total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations in the entire commune increased from 20% last year to 32%, an average of 56 yuan per person. Of the more than 2,000 households in the entire commune, more than 1,700 households have savings in the bank. The total retail sales of daily necessities in the supply and marketing cooperative reached 361,500 yuan, an average of 51.5 yuan per person, an increase of more than 70% compared with 30 yuan last year. As Ren Zilin, the director of the Huacha Management Area, said, how can people's lives now not be in heaven compared with before liberation?

    山乡牧业展翅飞
    山西五寨宋家沟人民公社的一年
    王林堂　张长珍　靳致中
    山西省五寨县宋家沟人民公社，是个人口少和规模比较小的公社——八十二个自然村，一共才有七千人；论面积，则是个大公社——全境有四百多平方公里，绕着边界转一圈，至少也得个把星期。这个公社在晋西北有名的管涔山南麓，境内完全是山。真个是“山连山，山套山，出了门子就爬山”。在这些连绵起伏的群山上，除近六万亩缓坡耕地和十余万亩森林之外，都是一片一片的牧坡，绿草茂密，是一个天然大牧场。
    生活在这一带的人们，虽然在很早以前就开始发展畜牧业了，但从来也没有见过像如今这样六畜兴旺的盛景。这只要举几个数目字，就可以看出这种发展变化的情况来：1949年，属于现在公社的这片地区里，只有一千二百多头牛、驴、骡、马等大牲畜，四千余只羊，近一千口猪。到1958年，大牲畜增加到两千五百七十一头，平均每年增长13％；羊增加到一万六千二百只，平均每年增长36％；猪增加到两千一百口，平均每年增长12.2％。九年内，大小牲畜净增的总数是一万四千六百七十一头，平均每年增长23.7％。按说，这样的发展速度，已经很快了，可是，1959年的头十个月，大小牲畜总数就又比1958年净增60％多，增加的绝对数为一万二千八百一十六头，相当于从1949年到1958年九年净增总和的87.3％。按全社两千一百零八户社员计算，平均每户已经有了十六头大小牲畜，十四只鸡。
    宋家沟公社1959年畜牧业能够获得如此惊人的发展，正像社员们说的，归根到底是有了人民公社。现在我们就看看这个答案的具体情形吧。
        分群分坡进行放牧
    俗话说：“人不可一日无粮，畜不可一日无草。”那就先说草坡的变化吧。
    宋家沟公社共有五十五万亩草坡，占全境总面积的67％。过去这些草坡是分属于三十一个高级社。但是，各个高级社占有草坡的多少不同，这几年来牲畜发展的快慢不一样。到1958年为止，有十四个社的大小牲畜只占现在全公社牲畜总数的35％，而草坡却占着现在全公社草坡总面积的一半，没有充分利用起来，任凭山草自长自枯；可是另外的十七个社，虽然草坡也占现在全公社草坡总面积的一半，而大小牲畜则占现在全公社牲畜总数的65％，牲畜多，草坡窄，不但在继续前进中感到路短迈不开步，就是眼前，因为大牲畜和羊不得不同坡吃草，山羊和绵羊、羯羊和母羊、大羊和羊羔、壮羊和弱羊也只能混群放牧，带来很大损失。牲畜多的社，想到别的村空闲的草坡上去放牧，可是人家也有自己的打算：要在那些山上植树育林。
    1958年9月，人民公社诞生以后，这个矛盾就迎刃而解了。公社不仅把原来的三十一个小型高级社从组织上联结成一个统一的整体，而且把人们的心也连在一起了。大家都认为，既然成了一个大家庭，就应当同舟共济，休戚相关。原来感到伸展不开手脚的村子，要求统一使用草坡，而拥有闲坡的那些村子里的人们也都笑呵呵地说：“只要对全公社有利，怎么也好办。”公社党委根据人们的这种意愿，把草坡划分成八个大片，每一片交给距离相近的两个或三个管理区共同使用。又在统一安排农田、林地和牧地的时候，根据各种牲畜不同的生活习性和其它特点，确定了全部草坡的不同使用办法：十九万亩远坡、陡坡和圪针比较稠密的坡放山羊，二十三万亩近坡、缓坡、圪针较少的坡放绵羊，十三万亩最近的缓坡、阳坡和河流两旁的草滩放大牲畜和猪。按照这种划分，全社普遍实行了分群分坡放牧的办法。这对于1959年畜牧业的飞跃发展，起了很大作用。就拿化岔管理区说吧，1958年近九百只羊分了三群，1959年一千二百三十只羊分成了十二群，有山羊群、绵羊群；这两类中又分为大羊群、羊羔群、羯羊群、母羊群、壮羊群、弱羊群等。过去混在一起放牧的时候，山羊不吃低头草，好走远坡、陡坡，喜欢在圪针丛中啃吃，绵羊也不得不跟上跑，吃不饱姑且不说，毛的损失就相当严重。绵羊在圪针稠密的坡上走过后，简直变成“棉花坡”了，有些绵羊常常是“两肋空空”。1959年分群分坡放牧以后，平均每只绵羊的产毛量由1958年的三斤增加到三斤半，提高16％。此外，因为大羊和羊羔分离。羊羔单独放牧，走的路少，吃的又饱，死亡率由1958年的8％降低到1.2％。羯羊和母羊分群，长的膘满肉肥。母羊集中到野草最茂密的坡上放牧，膘长得更好，一等膘的占98％，流产现象也基本上消灭了。
          大兴土木盖畜圈
    大兴土木盖畜圈，使牲畜得病、流产和死亡的数量大大减少了，这是宋家沟公社1959年六畜猛增的一个重要原因。而大规模地修建畜圈，就宋家沟这个山区来说，要不是建立了人民公社，是很难办到的。原因是这一带风沙又大又猛，盖畜圈要像盖人住的房子一样，也得工料俱精；如果盖成简陋的土房，一春天就会被大风刷得遍体鳞伤，圈顶露天，至于茅棚草舍就更不用说了。然而，要盖坚实的畜圈，的确也不容易。在过去的三十一个高级社里，就有二十五个社没有木料；有七个社每社只有一个木匠；还有十三个社连一个木匠也没有。有些社有木料和木匠，可是又没有砖瓦，有的社还缺乏资金。总之，不是短腿，便缺胳膊，没有一个社样样俱备。
    公社成立以后，首先从各个管理区抽调一些人新建起一座砖瓦厂和一座石灰厂，接着又把分散在各村的四十六个木匠和泥水匠组织起来，成立了一个畜圈基本建设队。同时还从六个有成林的管理区调剂了价值一万多元的木料，援助了缺少木材的管理区。另外又贷给穷管理区一千五百元资金，组织了一万二千多个工作日的劳动协作。这样，短短的一年就整修了旧圈一千三百五十七间，盖成了新圈五百二十六间。两年只砌成九间房地基的安子管理区，1959年一年就盖起三十六间新畜圈。化岔管理区新盖的六十五间畜圈，相当于他们在过去几十年间盖起的畜圈总数的一倍还多。由于修建了畜圈，不但一部分“无家可归”的牲畜搬进新居，而且全都住得松散舒适，不用拥挤了。原来那些破烂不堪的旧圈，经过整修，也由寒暑俱难防变成冬暖夏又凉了。牲畜因风吹、日晒、雨淋而得病、流产和死亡的现象，已经基本消灭。
        繁殖率普遍提高
    宋家沟公社畜牧业生产大发展，前面说过的统一使用草坡，实行分群分坡放牧，以及大规模地修建畜圈等，都是重要的原因。不过，最根本的原因，还是人民公社把原来一部分高级社很低的牲畜繁殖率，提高到先进水平上来了。
    过去，三十一个高级社的牲畜繁殖率，高低不齐，悬殊很大。最好的是化岔社，他们早在1956年就创造了大牲畜“热配”（母畜产后七天或九天就配种，这样做容易受胎）的经验，每年的产仔头数都占到适龄母畜的90％多；绝大部分母羊每年能保产一胎羔，还有一部分两年产三胎，并且用“双配”（采两只种羊的精液，分两次输给同一只母羊，中间相隔十五分钟左右）、“复配”（用一只种羊的精液，给同一只母羊输两次，中间也相隔十五分钟左右）的办法，使最健壮的母羊一胎就生双羔，除过一些空怀、流产和死亡的以外，每年净产羔数都占适龄母羊的100％以上。可是，别的高级社，大多都很难比得上了。特别是和尚泉、马跑泉、牛碾沟等十四个社，牲畜繁殖率更低，直到1958年它们大牲畜的产仔头数平均还只占适龄母畜的40％多，羊只产羔数也只占适龄母羊的52％。就这样，高的高，低的低，高低一背拉，平均水平就降下来了。不过，说实在的，就在那时候，这些牲畜繁殖率比较低的社也并不是不想学习先进经验，改变自己的落后面貌，问题是经济力量单薄，束缚住了它们的手脚。因为要提高牲畜繁殖率，首先必须使母畜有良好的营养。而牲畜繁殖率最低的那十四个社，恰恰都是穷社，直到1957年，人的口粮每年还得国家供应一部分，饲料又怎能充裕呢？正是由于饲料不足，母畜比较瘦弱，所以有很大一部分母畜根本就不发情，连年空怀，怀了胎的，流产的也不少。
    公社化以后的情形就不同了。不仅公社自己有了经济力量，能够援助这些穷管理区；而且由于这些穷管理区让出了原来属于他们所有的一部分空闲草坡，交给全社共同使用，穷富不同的管理区之间的利益更紧密地联系起来。那些比较富裕的管理区的社员们也认识到：就是富的地方，离开别人的援助也不行，只有互相支援，才能共同富裕。因而他们也都乐意帮助穷管理区了。这样，就为改变这些穷管理区的落后面貌，提供了十分有利的条件。公社党委抓住这些条件，很快就在全社发动了一个富帮穷、先进帮落后的运动。
    穷管理区为什么穷？主要原因是牲畜少（粮食产量低，和牲畜少也有直接关系），尤其是母畜少。因此，公社首先拿出一万六千多元国家无利贷款和近两万元公共积累，从牲畜多的管理区购买了一百二十多头母牛、母驴、母马和一千四百多只母羊，给了九个穷管理区（即原来的十四个穷高级社）。那些富管理区也这家三十，那家五十，又卖给这九个穷管理区一千多只母羊。但这样一来，问题就更大了。原来他们饲料就不足，现在缺的更多了。考虑到这一点，公社就又从粮食有富余的管理区，调剂出七万斤饲料，借给了这九个穷管理区。同时为了借助这股富帮穷的“东风”，使这些穷管理区尽快地拔掉穷根，和富管理区并驾齐驱，公社还下放了七个干部，到穷管理区担任了党的支部书记或管理区主任，帮助他们推行了原来在化岔、偏道沟等管理区已经行之有效的一整套经营管理制度，改善了饲养管理工作，建立起一支四百多人的畜牧专业队伍，组织了“红勤巧”劳动竞赛，系统地进行了政治思想教育工作。这样就大大激发了这些穷管理区社员们发奋图强的意志，鼓舞了他们彻底摆脱穷困的信心。在大追大赶中，穷管理区社员们的苦战精神发扬到了空前的高度。特别是牧工们，不问寒暑，不避风雨，终年风尘仆仆，辗转在崇山峻岭之间，辛勤劳动，苦心经营。结果，短短的一年，他们的牲畜繁殖率就都飞快地赶上了先进管理区的水平，有的甚至超过了先进管理区。比如吴家岔的羊群繁殖率就“大翻锅底”，成了全社繁殖率最高的管理区。他们1959年的产羔数由1958年占适龄母羊的79％猛增到180％，有45％的适龄母羊年产两茬羔，有26％的适龄母羊一胎生了双羔，羊只总数由去年的九百三十只，一年就翻到一千八百一十只，繁殖率提高一点二八倍，总头数增加了95％。这些穷管理区的整个经济面貌，也根本改观了。他们的畜牧业产值平均比1958年增加了一点三倍，农业也来了个大翻身，由缺粮变成余粮，社员的实际收入平均每人达到七十九元（富管理区平均九十元，都不包括社员家庭副业收入），比1958年的四十八元增加了近70％。
      打开全面增产之门
    大力发展畜牧业，给宋家沟公社带来了一片繁荣丰盛的景象。首先，它使粮食产量大大提高。历史上这里是个缺粮区，粮食亩产量只有六十斤左右，1957年也不过一百斤稍多一点，国家每年都得供应他们五、六十万斤粮食。但近两年来由于畜牧业的大发展，每头耕畜平均负担的土地由过去的一百多亩降低到五十来亩，耕地深度由过去的四寸加深到八寸左右，每亩农田的施肥量达到一百三十多担，全社每人五亩基本农田，平均每亩就有一头牲畜积肥，因而粮食亩产量1958年提高到一百三十四斤，1959年更超过了二百斤。总产量达到八百三十八万斤，每人平均一千一百多斤。粮食多了，饲料就充裕了。1957年饲料共五十二万斤，1958年是七十五万斤，1959年增加到一百三十八万斤。人的口粮也增多了，1957年平均每人吃粮三百二十斤，1958年是三百八十斤，1959年达到四百五十斤。整个公社已由缺粮社变成余粮社，去年卖给国家的粮食是一百万斤，今年卖了一百三十五万斤，还储备下一百二十万斤。
    畜牧业的大发展，提供了越来越多的运输力，使林业和副业的收入也急剧地增加起来。这个公社山货很多，只因绝大多数村都是盘山小路，只能走牲畜，牲畜少的时候，这些山货就难于大量运出去。今年全社组织了一支三百多头牲畜的专业运输队，把山货和木材大量运入城市，收入达到十九万一千六百元，比去年增加了一点四倍。
    社员们特别引以自豪的，是由于畜牧业的大发展，能够以更多的畜产品支援国家轻工业的原料，供应城市人民的肉食和蛋品。到今年10月底，全社出售给国家的猪、羊、牛共折合肉十六万五千斤，鸡蛋两万二千一百斤，羊毛四万二千斤，各种皮子两千八百二十五张，总值达十八万六千余元，比1957年全年的出售总值增加了二点六倍，比去年增加80％。
    畜牧业的飞速发展，更大大增加了公社和社员的收入。今年全社畜牧业的产值为三十九万五千元，比1957年增加三倍多，比去年增加一点四六倍。它在全社农林牧副各业总产值中的比重，由去年的20％提高到32％，每人平均五十六元。全社两千多户社员，就有一千七百多户在银行里存了款。供销店的生活日用百货零售总额达三十六万一千五百元，每人平均五十一点五元，比去年的三十元提高70％多。正如化岔管理区主任任子林说的，现在人们的生活，要跟解放前比起来，还不就是在天堂上吗？
