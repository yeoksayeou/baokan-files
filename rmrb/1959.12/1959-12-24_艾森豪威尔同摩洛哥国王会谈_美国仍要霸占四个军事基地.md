Xinhua News Agency, Casablanca, December 22nd: U.S. President Eisenhower arrived in Morocco from Madrid on the morning of the 22nd for a visit. He stayed in Casablanca for six hours and held talks with Moroccan King Mohammed V.

It is reported that one of the main topics of the U.S.-Moroccan talks was the issue of U.S. military bases in Morocco. The United States has a total of five air force bases in Morocco, with more than 10,000 troops stationed there.

Morocco has never recognized the status of U.S. military bases established in Morocco under the secret Franco-American military agreement signed in 1950. It began holding multiple negotiations with the United States in May 1957, which lasted for two and a half years without any results. In a recent royal address, the Moroccan King said that the withdrawal of foreign troops is Morocco's "top priority."

According to the joint communique issued after the Eisenhower-Mohammed V talks, the United States only agreed to abandon the Ben Slimane Airport, one of the five air force bases, by the end of March 1960. The other four military bases will not be evacuated until the end of 1963, four years later. It is reported that in the U.S. war preparation plan, the United States will mass-produce intercontinental missiles by 1963, at which time the air force bases in Morocco will lose their importance.

Eisenhower hurriedly took off from the Nouasseur U.S. Air Force Base near Casablanca that afternoon and returned to Washington, thus ending his twenty-day visit to eleven countries.

　　艾森豪威尔同摩洛哥国王会谈
    美国仍要霸占四个军事基地
    新华社卡萨布兰卡22日电　美国总统艾森豪威尔22日上午从马德里到达摩洛哥访问。他在卡萨布兰卡停留了六小时，同摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世举行了会谈。
    据悉，美摩会谈的主要内容之一是美国在摩洛哥的军事基地问题。美国在摩洛哥共拥有五个空军基地，驻军一万多名。
    摩洛哥一直不承认美国根据1950年秘密签订的法美军事协定而在摩洛哥建立军事基地的地位，从1957年5月起就开始同美国举行多次谈判，两年半之久而没有结果。摩洛哥国王在不久前发表的御前演说中说，撤退外国军队是摩洛哥的“首要急务”。
    据艾森豪威尔同穆罕默德五世会谈后发表的联合公报表明，美国只答应在1960年3月底以前放弃五个空军基地之一的本·斯利曼机场。其他四个军事基地要在四年之后在1963年年底才撤出。据悉，在美国的备战计划中，到1963年美国将大批生产洲际导弹，到那个时候，在摩洛哥空军基地将失去它们的重要性。
    艾森豪威尔在当天下午就匆匆地从卡萨布兰卡附近的努瓦塞美国空军基地起飞，返回华盛顿，从而结束他对十一个国家的历时二十天的访问。
