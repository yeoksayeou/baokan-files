    Comprehensive Solution to the Overseas Chinese Issue Existing Between China and Indonesia
    On December 9th, Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country wrote to Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia, representing our government, to propose suggestions for a comprehensive solution to the issue of Overseas Chinese existing between China and Indonesia. It advocates that the two countries immediately exchange the instruments of ratification of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality, so that this treaty can come into effect and be implemented as soon as possible, so that Overseas Chinese in Indonesia with dual nationality can choose Indonesian nationality on a voluntary basis and become Indonesian citizens. It requests the Indonesian government to earnestly protect the legitimate rights and interests of those Overseas Chinese who voluntarily retain Chinese nationality or have not been approved to choose Indonesian nationality. As for those Overseas Chinese who are displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia, our government is prepared, according to their wishes, to arrange for them to return to the country to participate in the construction of the motherland, and hopes that the Indonesian government will repatriate these Overseas Chinese back to the country in batches according to the principle of fairness and reasonableness. At a time when Indonesia has experienced serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, which is extremely detrimental to the friendship between the two countries, Foreign Minister Chen of our country put forward such suggestions, fully demonstrating our government's major effort, out of the desire to maintain the friendship between China and Indonesia, to completely resolve the Overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries. The Chinese people express their firm support and complete support for the suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen.
    Recently, within Indonesia, a portion of influential forces hostile to the friendship between China and Indonesia have used Indonesia's decree prohibiting foreign small retailers from doing business outside the capitals of first- and second-level autonomous regions and states to wantonly infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, forcing them to relocate and cutting off their livelihoods. Local Overseas Chinese have repeatedly appealed to the local government, requesting protection and opposing forced relocation; our government has repeatedly brought the matter to the attention of the Indonesian government, and our embassies and consulates in Indonesia have repeatedly made representations and protests, requesting the Indonesian government to take effective measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese. However, this anti-Chinese current not only has not been stopped, but has intensified and become increasingly fierce. During the forced relocation, even troops were dispatched, firing shots, resulting in bloodshed. Overseas Chinese property has suffered huge losses, personal safety has been seriously infringed upon, a large number of Overseas Chinese have lost their livelihoods, become displaced, and even subjected to inhumane detention and abuse. At the same time, some newspapers and periodicals in Indonesia, in order to incite anti-Chinese sentiment among the Indonesian people to cooperate with their anti-Chinese activities, have disseminated a large number of remarks attacking and slandering our country, and even openly insulted the beloved leaders of the Chinese people. The Chinese people express their heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the Indonesian Overseas Chinese who have been subjected to unwarranted persecution, and cannot but feel serious concern and great indignation at the extremely unfriendly behavior towards our country that has occurred.
    As Foreign Minister Chen Yi pointed out in his letter to Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia: "Our two countries have always been friendly. Since the Bandung Conference, our friendly relations have undergone new and significant development. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between our two countries, but we are both suffering from imperialist aggression and interference, and we are both faced with the enormous tasks of developing the economy and raising the living standards of the people. Therefore, the continued mutual support and strengthening of friendly cooperation between our two countries is in the fundamental interests of the people of both countries, and it is also an important factor in maintaining peace in Asia and the world." This principle cannot be denied by anyone except those with ulterior motives. Therefore, as long as both sides jointly abide by the ten principles of the Bandung Conference and proceed from the constant maintenance and development of the friendship between the two countries, there is no problem between China and Indonesia that cannot be resolved through friendly consultation. Taking the Overseas Chinese issue as an example, our two governments have long reached a consensus, jointly believing that this is an issue left over from long-term historical development. In the new situation where our two countries have successively achieved independence and formed friendly relations, the rational solution of this issue has unprecedentedly favorable conditions. Therefore, the Overseas Chinese issue should also be treated in accordance with friendly principles, seeking a solution that is fair and reasonable to both sides, and absolutely not allowing the adoption of unilateral and rude actions, thereby harming the friendly relations between the two countries.
    In fact, since the founding of New China, our government has consistently adhered to the above-mentioned principles and strived to reasonably resolve the Overseas Chinese issue with the Indonesian government. Our government has always advised Overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia to respect the laws and customs of their country of residence, not to participate in local political activities, and to strive to help the local people develop their economy and culture and live in friendship with the local people. In view of the fact that many Overseas Chinese have resided in Indonesia for generations, and they have been integrated with the local people in economic life, the Chinese government is willing to see these Overseas Chinese choose Indonesian nationality on a voluntary basis. Once they acquire Indonesian nationality, they should of course be loyal to Indonesia, and at the same time they should of course enjoy the rights of citizens of this country, without any discrimination. Therefore, Overseas Chinese joining the nationality of their country of residence is beneficial to themselves and to their country of residence. In order to eliminate the unreasonable phenomenon of Overseas Chinese having dual nationality, our country and the Indonesian government signed a relevant treaty as early as April 1955. Subsequently, the prime ministers of the two countries exchanged letters on June 3, 1955 on the implementation of this treaty. Two months ago, the foreign ministers of the two countries issued a joint communiqué, putting forward clear principles on how to enable the economic strength of Overseas Chinese to continue to play a beneficial role in Indonesia's economic development. If the various principles and methods agreed upon by both parties are effectively implemented and observed, the Overseas Chinese issue could have been gradually resolved reasonably, and the friendly relations between the two countries could have been further developed.
    However, the actual situation is not like this. Recently, not only have anti-Chinese actions appeared on the Indonesian side, but they have turned around and slandered the steps taken by the Chinese government to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese as interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, which is obviously untenable. Everyone knows that China has always been friendly to Indonesia, respects Indonesia's sovereignty and independence, and has always tried its best to provide assistance when Indonesia encounters difficulties. However, Overseas Chinese in Indonesia are now being treated as nationals of hostile countries and subjected to extremely rude and inhumane treatment. May I ask, is this the attitude that friendly countries should take when resolving issues between themselves? Is this in line with the principles of the Bandung Conference?
    As for the economic aspect of the Overseas Chinese issue, everyone knows that the current anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia are being carried out under the pretext of so-called "developing the national economy." Overseas Chinese small vendors are slandered as "remnants of colonial economic" and attacked as hindering the development of Indonesia's national economy, and even venomously cursed as "more vicious than the colonialists." This accusation is obviously inconsistent with historical facts and the current situation. Chinese nationals have resided in Indonesia for more than 1,500 years. From the beginning of the seventeenth century to the middle of the eighteenth century, after the Netherlands occupied Indonesia, a large number of Chinese laborers were abducted by the Dutch colonists to open up colonies for them. In the past hundred years, due to internal and external troubles in our country and the bankruptcy of the countryside, more poor peasants, in order to make a living, did not hesitate to leave their hometowns and wander overseas, thus forming a large population of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The vast majority of these Overseas Chinese are working people, who have long suffered the oppression of the colonialists together with the Indonesian people. Their hard work for generations has made an indelible contribution to Indonesia's economic and cultural development. Speaking of the small vendors who are being persecuted now, their labor and small-scale operations also play an active role in supplying the needs of the local people and enlivening local commodity circulation. May I ask what this has in common with the so-called "colonial economy"? In fact, the Overseas Chinese economy was formed along with the development of the Indonesian national economy, and it has become a component of the Indonesian economy, which is beneficial to the development of the Indonesian national economy. This point is also recognized by Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio. It was clearly mentioned in the joint communiqué of the two foreign ministers that "the economic strength of Overseas Chinese will still play a beneficial role in Indonesia's economic development." President Sukarno also announced in his political declaration on August 17: "Non-domestic forces and funds that have settled down in Indonesia, agree and are even prepared to help implement the program of the working cabinet will receive appropriate status and opportunities in our activities to increase industrial and agricultural production." Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that the current anti-Chinese measures in Indonesia directly violate the joint communiqué of the two foreign ministers and also violate President Sukarno's political declaration. Today, what truly threatens the development of Indonesia's national economy is the monopoly capital of imperialism, not the Overseas Chinese economy. Dare not touch the former, but concentrate on attacking Overseas Chinese small vendors. Will this bring any benefits to Indonesia's economic development?
    The Chinese government and people cannot but express their utmost concern for the current situation of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Everyone knows that in the era of Old China, the vast majority of Overseas Chinese who wandered overseas were forced to do so for a living, and had to rely on others. In their countries of residence, they often suffered discrimination, abuse, and humiliation from imperialists and local reactionary forces, with no one to complain to, no country to return to, and had to swallow their anger. However, this tragic situation has disappeared since the founding of the People's Republic of China. If there are still people who look at the problem with old eyes, thinking that Overseas Chinese are still as helpless as in the past, with no way out except to seek a living in their countries of residence, and thinking that the Chinese government and 650 million Chinese people will sit idly by and watch Overseas Chinese suffer unwarranted discrimination and persecution overseas, then they are greatly mistaken. The three suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country to Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia are all reasonable. Overseas Chinese who are willing to choose Indonesian nationality should acquire Indonesian nationality in accordance with the treaty between the two countries on the issue of dual nationality; Overseas Chinese who are unwilling or unable to acquire Indonesian nationality should be given due protection; Overseas Chinese who cannot survive in Indonesia or voluntarily return to their country should be repatriated in batches. We hope that the Indonesian government can immediately stop the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese and can quickly reach an agreement with our government on Foreign Minister Chen Yi's suggestions. Based on the friendship with the Indonesian people, our people eagerly hope that the Overseas Chinese issue in Indonesia can be resolved satisfactorily in accordance with the first two suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi, and at the same time express a warm welcome to the Overseas Chinese who request to return to their country. In today's China, 650 million people are developing the motherland's boundless resources with unparalleled enthusiasm and building our beautiful and rich homeland. We want to build a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Although we have 650 million people, we still feel that there is a shortage of labor. Since the founding of our country ten years ago, 300,000 Overseas Chinese have returned to their motherland one after another and participated in the socialist construction of the motherland. After returning to the country, they have been warmly welcomed by the people of the motherland and have been properly arranged and cared for in their lives and work. Many of them have become labor models and heroes in socialist construction, establishing glorious feats for their motherland and future generations. Therefore, in the new era of the motherland's prosperity, the motherland is always opening its warm embrace to all compatriots residing abroad who encounter difficulties or are willing to return for other reasons.
    Now, just as Overseas Chinese in Indonesia are being subjected to unwarranted discrimination and persecution, Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country has formally proposed in his letter to Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia that the Chinese government is prepared to arrange for those Overseas Chinese who are displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia to live in the country according to their wishes to return to the country, giving them the opportunity to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. This suggestion is fully in line with the wishes of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia and is also something that the government of any friendly country has no reason to refuse. At the same time, our welcome to Overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in socialist construction fully demonstrates that the Chinese people have never and will never intend to use Overseas Chinese to harm any country, or to use the so-called "excessive" population to "expand" abroad. This fundamentally shatters the lies spread by imperialism and foreign reactionaries that Overseas Chinese are China's "fifth column" for carrying out subversive activities and that China's population growth will become a "threat" to neighboring Asian countries.
    Of course, the repatriation of a large number of Overseas Chinese is still a complex task, and only with the friendly assistance and cooperation of the Indonesian government and people can these Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return be able to return safely and smoothly. Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country specifically mentioned several hopes in his letter to Foreign Minister Subandrio, which are also completely reasonable. First of all, the return of Overseas Chinese should be voluntary. China is willing to accept Overseas Chinese to return to the country, but it must not be used as a pretext for anti-Chinese activities, and there must not be any coercion. For those Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to the country, their wishes should also be respected and should not be hindered. Good relations back and forth will not harm the friendly feelings of the people of the two countries. Secondly, these Overseas Chinese have resided in Indonesia for generations and have of course established industries, which they have acquired through years of hard work. They have shed a lot of blood and sweat for Indonesia and created a lot of wealth. When they are about to leave Indonesia, the only small amount of property they have should naturally be allowed to be sold and the proceeds should be brought back. Thirdly, their safety on the way back to the country should be guaranteed. Especially in the current situation in Indonesia, where there is a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment, the lives of Overseas Chinese are not guaranteed at all, and raising this point is particularly important. Finally, in order to facilitate our government to orderly settle these returned Overseas Chinese, we also hope that the Indonesian government will repatriate them in batches. This will be convenient for organizing ships and carrying out repatriation and reception in a planned manner. At the same time, it is also easy for the Indonesian government to do. Japan is a defeated aggressor country, and China and Japan have not yet concluded a treaty of peace and established diplomatic relations, but the Chinese government has made every effort to make the most thorough arrangements for the repatriation of Japanese nationals in China. We believe that the Indonesian government, whether proceeding from the friendly relations between the two countries or from the principles of humanity and justice, should not object to these reasonable demands of our government.
    The suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country have provided a reasonable basis for a comprehensive solution to the Overseas Chinese issue existing between China and Indonesia. The Overseas Chinese issue can only be resolved through friendly consultation. Any unilateral and rude approach will only add difficulties to the solution of the problem. The anti-Chinese and anti-China activities currently being incited in Indonesia have also aroused the unease and dissatisfaction of the kind people and fair-minded people of Indonesia. The Jakarta "Dawn Daily" editorial on November 20th said it well: For the situation caused by the anti-Chinese movement in Indonesia, "only those who hoped that Indonesia would fall into chaos from the beginning are happy." It loudly called: "Return to the road of the Bandung Conference"! We sincerely hope that the Indonesian government will value the friendship between China and Indonesia and the solidarity of Asian and African countries, carefully consider the suggestions of Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country, and hold negotiations as soon as possible; at the same time, quickly stop the continued anti-Chinese and anti-China activities in order to create an atmosphere conducive to negotiations. We firmly believe that as long as both sides cherish the desire to maintain the friendly relations between the two countries, the Overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries can be resolved reasonably through friendly consultation. And the rational solution of the Overseas Chinese issue will dispel the temporary dark clouds, make the friendship between China and Indonesia further developed, and make the conspiracy of imperialism and its agents to sow discord between China and Indonesia fail.

    全面解决存在于中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的华侨问题
    我国陈毅外长12月9日写信给印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约，代表我国政府提出了全面解决存在于中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的华侨问题的建议，主张两国立即交换关于双重国籍问题的条约的批准书，使这个条约能够早日生效和付诸实施，以便在印度尼西亚具有双重国籍的华侨能够根据自愿的原则选择印度尼西亚国籍而成为印度尼西亚的公民，要求印度尼西亚政府切实保护那些自愿保留中国国籍或者由于选择印度尼西亚国籍而未获批准的华侨的正当权利和利益。至于那些流离失所、无法谋生或者不愿继续居留在印度尼西亚的华侨，我国政府准备根据他们的志愿，安排他们回国参加祖国的建设，并且希望印度尼西亚政府按照公平合理的原则，分期分批地遣送这些华侨回国。当着印度尼西亚发生了严重损害华侨正当权益、极其不利于两国友谊的情况的时候，我国陈外长提出这样的建议，充分表明我国政府从维护中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好愿望出发，为彻底解决存在于两国之间的华侨问题，又一次作出了重大的努力。中国人民对陈外长提出的建议表示坚决拥护和完全支持。
    最近一个时期以来，在印度尼西亚国内，一部分敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的有影响的势力，利用印度尼西亚禁止外国小零售商在一级和二级自治区和州的首府以外地区经商的法令，肆意侵犯华侨的正当权益，强迫他们迁移，断绝他们的生计。当地华侨曾经一再向当地政府发出呼吁，要求保护，反对逼迁；我国政府曾经一再提请印度尼西亚政府注意，我国驻印度尼西亚使领馆也一再经过交涉和抗议，要求印度尼西亚政府采取有效措施，保护华侨的正当权益。但是，这股排华逆流不仅没有被制止，反而变本加厉，愈演愈凶。在迫迁当中，甚至出动军队，鸣枪射击，发生了流血事件。华侨财产遭到了巨大的损失，人身安全受到了严重的侵害，大批华侨丧失生计，流离失所，甚至受到惨无人道的拘禁虐待。与此同时，印度尼西亚的某些报刊，为了在印度尼西亚人民中间煽动反华的情绪，以配合其排华活动，大量散布攻击和污蔑我国的言论，甚而公然侮辱中国人民敬爱的领袖。中国人民对于遭到无端迫害的印度尼西亚华侨表示衷心的同情和慰问，对于在印度尼西亚发生的对我国极不友好的行为，不能不感到严重关切和十分愤慨。
    正如陈毅外长给印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约的信中所指出的：“我们两国从来就是友好的，从万隆会议以来，我们的友好关系又有了新的、显著的发展。我们两国没有根本的利害冲突，却同样遭受着帝国主义的侵略和干涉，同样面临着发展经济、提高人民生活水平的巨大任务。因此，我们两国继续互相支持，加强友好合作，正是两国人民根本利益的所在，也是维护亚洲和世界和平的重要因素。”这个道理除了别有用心的势力之外，是任何人也不能加以否认的。因此，只要双方共同遵守万隆会议的十项原则，从不断维护和发展两国的友谊出发，在中国和印度尼西亚之间，是没有什么问题不能通过友好协商求得解决的。即以华侨问题而论，我们两国政府早就达到一致的认识，共同认为这是一个由于长期历史发展遗留下来的问题。在我们两国相继取得独立并且结成友好关系的新的情况下，这个问题的合理解决就具备了空前有利的条件。因此，对待华侨问题，同样应该本着友好的原则，求得对于双方都是公平合理的解决，决不容许采取片面和粗暴的行动，从而损害两国之间的友好关系。
    事实上，从新中国成立以后，我国政府一贯本着上述的原则，努力争取同印度尼西亚政府合理解决华侨问题。我国政府一向劝勉居住在印度尼西亚的华侨尊重侨居国的法令和习惯，不参加当地的政治活动，努力帮助当地人民发展经济和文化事业，同当地人民友好相处。鉴于许多华侨世世代代居留在印度尼西亚，他们在经济生活中，已经同当地人民融合在一起。中国政府愿意看到，这些华侨能够根据自愿的原则选择印度尼西亚国籍。他们一旦取得印度尼西亚的国籍，就当然应效忠于印度尼西亚，同时也当然应享受这个国家的公民权利，而不受任何歧视。因此，华侨加入侨居国的国籍，不论对于他们自己或者对于侨居国来说，都是有利的。为了消除华侨具有双重国籍的不合理现象，我国和印度尼西亚政府早在1955年4月就签订了有关的条约。接着，两国总理在1955年6月3日就这个条约的实施办法进行了换文。两个月以前，两国外长又发表联合公报，对于如何使华侨的经济力量继续发挥有益于印度尼西亚经济发展的作用，提出了明确的原则。如果双方早已协议的各项原则和办法得到切实的执行和遵守，华侨问题本来可以逐步求得合理的解决，两国的友好关系也可以进一步发展。
    但是，实际情况并不是这样。最近在印度尼西亚方面不仅出现了排华行动，而且反过来却诋毁中国政府为了保护华侨的正当权益所采取的步骤是干涉印度尼西亚的内政，这显然是站不住脚的。谁都知道，中国一贯对印度尼西亚友好，尊重印度尼西亚的主权和独立，并且在印度尼西亚遇到困难的时候，总是尽力给以支援。但是，现在华侨在印度尼西亚却被当作是敌对国家的侨民，受到极其粗暴和不人道的待遇。试问，这是友好国家在解决相互间的问题时应该采取的态度吗？这是合乎万隆会议原则的吗？
    至于谈到华侨问题的经济方面，大家都知道，目前在印度尼西亚的排华活动，是在所谓“发展民族经济”的借口下进行的。华侨小商贩被诬蔑为“殖民主义经济残余”，被攻击为妨碍印度尼西亚民族经济的发展，甚至被毒骂得“比殖民者还穷凶极恶”。这种指责显然是不符合于历史事实和现实情况的。我国侨民旅居印度尼西亚已经有一千五百年以上的历史。从十七世纪初到十八世纪中叶，荷兰侵占印度尼西亚以后，又有大批华工被荷兰殖民者拐骗去为它开拓殖民地。近一百多年来，我国因为内忧外患，农村破产，更多穷苦的农民为了谋求生计，不惜离乡背井，飘泊海外，因而形成印度尼西亚华侨人口众多的情况。这些华侨当中绝大部分都是劳动人民，他们长期和印度尼西亚人民一起受着殖民主义者的压榨。他们世世代代的辛勤劳动，给印度尼西亚的经济和文化发展作出了不可抹杀的贡献。就说现在遭受迫害的小商贩，他们的劳动和小本经营对于供应当地人民需要、活跃当地商品流通也起着积极的作用。试问这和所谓“殖民主义经济”有何共同之处？事实上华侨经济是随同印度尼西亚民族经济的发展而形成的，它已经成为印度尼西亚经济的一个组成部分，对印度尼西亚民族经济的发展是有益的。这一点，印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约也是承认的。在两国外长联合公报中曾经明确地提到，“华侨的经济力量将仍然对于印度尼西亚的经济发展起有益作用”。苏加诺总统在8月17日的政治宣言中也曾宣布：“已经在印度尼西亚安顿下来、同意而且还准备帮助实行工作内阁的纲领的非本国的力量和资金，在我们增加工农业生产的活动中都将得到适当的地位和机会。”因之，不难理解，目前印度尼西亚的排华措施，既直接破坏了两国外长的联合公报，也违反了苏加诺总统的政治宣言。今天真正威胁着印度尼西亚民族经济发展的是帝国主义的垄断资本，并不是华侨经济，对前者不敢触动而集中力量打击华侨小商贩，难道这会给印度尼西亚的经济发展带来任何好处吗？
    中国政府和人民，对于目前印度尼西亚华侨的处境，不能不表示万分关切。谁都知道，在旧中国的时代，绝大多数飘泊海外的华侨都是为生计所迫，不得不寄人篱下，在侨居国往往受尽帝国主义和当地反动势力的歧视、虐待和凌辱，有苦难诉，有国难归，只得忍气吞声。但是，这种悲惨情况，从中华人民共和国成立以后，已经一去不复返了。如果还有谁仍用老眼光来看问题，以为华侨还像过去一样，无依无靠，除了在侨居国谋求生活以外，就别无出路，以为中国政府和六亿五千万中国人民，还会坐视侨胞在海外遭受无端的歧视和迫害，那就大错特错了。我国陈毅外长向印度尼西亚苏班德里约外长所提出的三项建议，都是合情合理的。愿意选择印度尼西亚国籍的华侨，应该根据两国关于双重国籍问题的条约取得印度尼西亚国籍；不愿或不能取得印度尼西亚国籍的华侨，应该受到应有的保护；在印度尼西亚无法生存或者自愿回国的华侨，应该分批分期地得到遣送回国。我们希望印度尼西亚政府能够立即制止对华侨的武力迫迁，并且能够就陈毅外长的建议迅速同我国政府达成协议。我国人民本着同印度尼西亚人民的友谊，热望在印度尼西亚的华侨问题能够按照陈毅外长所提出的前两项建议获得圆满解决，同时对于要求回国的华侨也表示热烈的欢迎。今天的中国，六亿五千万人民正在以无比沸腾的热情开发着祖国无穷无尽的资源，建设着我们美丽富饶的家园。我们要建设一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，我们虽有六亿五千万人口，也还感觉劳动力不足。我们建国十年以来，已经先后有三十万侨胞回到祖国，参加了祖国的社会主义建设事业。他们在回国以后，受到了祖国人民的热情欢迎，在生活和工作上都得到了妥善的安排和照顾。他们之中有许多人已经成为社会主义建设中的劳动模范和英雄，为自己的祖国和后代子孙建树了光荣的功勋。因此，在祖国欣欣向荣的新时代，一切侨居国外的同胞遇到困难或由于其他原因愿意回来的，祖国随时都向他们敞开着温暖的怀抱。
    现在，正当印度尼西亚的华侨处于被无端歧视和迫害的情况下，我国陈外长在致印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约的信中已经正式提出，对于那些流离失所、无法谋生或者不愿意继续留居在印度尼西亚的华侨，中国政府准备根据他们的回国的志愿，安排他们在国内生活，使他们有机会参加祖国的社会主义建设。这种建议是完全符合于印度尼西亚华侨的愿望的，也是任何友好国家政府没有理由拒绝的。同时我们欢迎华侨回国参加社会主义建设，也充分表明了中国人民从来并且永远不打算利用华侨去损害任何国家，或者要利用所谓“过多”的人口向外“扩张”。这就从根本上粉碎了帝国主义和外国反动派所散布的所谓华侨是中国进行颠覆活动的“第五纵队”、以及所谓中国人口的增长将成为亚洲邻国的“威胁”的谰言。
    当然，大批华侨归国还是一桩复杂的工作，只有得到了印度尼西亚政府和人民的友好协助和合作，才能使得这些自愿回国的华侨能够平安、顺利地归来。我国陈外长在给苏班德里约外长的信中具体提到了几点希望，这也是完全合乎情理的。首先，回国的华侨应当出于自愿，中国愿意接受华侨回国，决不能被利用为排华的借口，不能够有任何强制的情况。对于那些自愿回国的华侨，也应当尊重他们的志愿，不要加以阻拦。好来好往，才不至于伤害两国人民的友好感情。其次，这些华侨在印度尼西亚世代居留，当然置下了产业，这是他们多年辛劳所获。他们为印度尼西亚流了不少血汗，创造了不少财富，在他们要离开印度尼西亚的时候，个人仅有的一点财产，自然应该被允许变卖，并且带回所得的资金。再其次，他们归国途中的安全应当得到保证。特别是在目前印度尼西亚国内，正在刮着一片排华反华之风，华侨的生命毫无保障，提出这样一点是特别重要的。最后，为了便于我国政府有秩序地安置这些归侨，还希望印度尼西亚政府分批遣送他们回国。这样做，对于组织船只，有计划地进行遣送和接待，都两得其便。同时也是印度尼西亚政府很容易办得到的。日本是战败的侵略国，中日两国至今尚未订立和约，建立邦交，但是中国政府对于遣送在华日侨，尚且竭尽心力，作了最周到的安排。我们相信，印度尼西亚政府不论是从两国友好关系出发，从人道和正义的原则出发，都不应该对我国政府的这些合理要求表示异议。
    我国陈外长提出的建议已经为全面解决存在于中国和印度尼西亚之间的华侨问题提供了合理的基础。华侨问题只能通过友好协商来解决。任何片面和粗暴的做法都只会给问题的解决增加困难。目前在印度尼西亚被煽起的排华和反华活动，也已引起了印度尼西亚的善良人民和公正人士的不安和不满。雅加达“黎明日报”11月20日的社论说得好：对于由于在印度尼西亚发生排华运动而导致的局面，“只有那些在一开始就希望印度尼西亚陷入混乱的人才感到高兴”。它大声疾呼：“回到万隆会议的道路上来”！我们衷心希望印度尼西亚政府以中国和印度尼西亚两国的友谊为重，以亚非国家的团结为重，慎重考虑我国陈外长的建议，早日举行谈判；同时迅速制止继续未已的排华和反华活动，以创造有利于谈判的气氛。我们坚信，只要双方都怀着维护两国友好关系的愿望，经过友好协商，存在于两国之间的华侨问题是不难可以获得合理底解决的。而华侨问题的合理解决，将会驱散暂时的乌云，使中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的友谊，得到更进一步的发展，使帝国主义和它的代理人挑拨中国和印度尼西亚友谊的阴谋不能得逞。
