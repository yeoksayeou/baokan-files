    Comprehensive Solution to the Overseas Chinese Issue Existing Between China and Indonesia
    On December 9th, Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country wrote to Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia, representing our government, to propose suggestions for a comprehensive solution to the issue of Overseas Chinese existing between China and Indonesia. It advocates that the two countries immediately exchange the instruments of ratification of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality, so that this treaty can come into effect and be implemented as soon as possible, so that Overseas Chinese in Indonesia with dual nationality can choose Indonesian nationality on a voluntary basis and become Indonesian citizens. It requests the Indonesian government to earnestly protect the legitimate rights and interests of those Overseas Chinese who voluntarily retain Chinese nationality or have not been approved to choose Indonesian nationality. As for those Overseas Chinese who are displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia, our government is prepared, according to their wishes, to arrange for them to return to the country to participate in the construction of the motherland, and hopes that the Indonesian government will repatriate these Overseas Chinese back to the country in batches according to the principle of fairness and reasonableness. At a time when Indonesia has experienced serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, which is extremely detrimental to the friendship between the two countries, Foreign Minister Chen of our country put forward such suggestions, fully demonstrating our government's major effort, out of the desire to maintain the friendship between China and Indonesia, to completely resolve the Overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries. The Chinese people express their firm support and complete support for the suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen.
    Recently, within Indonesia, a portion of influential forces hostile to the friendship between China and Indonesia have used Indonesia's decree prohibiting foreign small retailers from doing business outside the capitals of first- and second-level autonomous regions and states to wantonly infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, forcing them to relocate and cutting off their livelihoods. Local Overseas Chinese have repeatedly appealed to the local government, requesting protection and opposing forced relocation; our government has repeatedly brought the matter to the attention of the Indonesian government, and our embassies and consulates in Indonesia have repeatedly made representations and protests, requesting the Indonesian government to take effective measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese. However, this anti-Chinese current not only has not been stopped, but has intensified and become increasingly fierce. During the forced relocation, even troops were dispatched, firing shots, resulting in bloodshed. Overseas Chinese property has suffered huge losses, personal safety has been seriously infringed upon, a large number of Overseas Chinese have lost their livelihoods, become displaced, and even subjected to inhumane detention and abuse. At the same time, some newspapers and periodicals in Indonesia, in order to incite anti-Chinese sentiment among the Indonesian people to cooperate with their anti-Chinese activities, have disseminated a large number of remarks attacking and slandering our country, and even openly insulted the beloved leaders of the Chinese people. The Chinese people express their heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the Indonesian Overseas Chinese who have been subjected to unwarranted persecution, and cannot but feel serious concern and great indignation at the extremely unfriendly behavior towards our country that has occurred.
    As Foreign Minister Chen Yi pointed out in his letter to Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia: "Our two countries have always been friendly. Since the Bandung Conference, our friendly relations have undergone new and significant development. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between our two countries, but we are both suffering from imperialist aggression and interference, and we are both faced with the enormous tasks of developing the economy and raising the living standards of the people. Therefore, the continued mutual support and strengthening of friendly cooperation between our two countries is in the fundamental interests of the people of both countries, and it is also an important factor in maintaining peace in Asia and the world." This principle cannot be denied by anyone except those with ulterior motives. Therefore, as long as both sides jointly abide by the ten principles of the Bandung Conference and proceed from the constant maintenance and development of the friendship between the two countries, there is no problem between China and Indonesia that cannot be resolved through friendly consultation. Taking the Overseas Chinese issue as an example, our two governments have long reached a consensus, jointly believing that this is an issue left over from long-term historical development. In the new situation where our two countries have successively achieved independence and formed friendly relations, the rational solution of this issue has unprecedentedly favorable conditions. Therefore, the Overseas Chinese issue should also be treated in accordance with friendly principles, seeking a solution that is fair and reasonable to both sides, and absolutely not allowing the adoption of unilateral and rude actions, thereby harming the friendly relations between the two countries.
    In fact, since the founding of New China, our government has consistently adhered to the above-mentioned principles and strived to reasonably resolve the Overseas Chinese issue with the Indonesian government. Our government has always advised Overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia to respect the laws and customs of their country of residence, not to participate in local political activities, and to strive to help the local people develop their economy and culture and live in friendship with the local people. In view of the fact that many Overseas Chinese have resided in Indonesia for generations, and they have been integrated with the local people in economic life, the Chinese government is willing to see these Overseas Chinese choose Indonesian nationality on a voluntary basis. Once they acquire Indonesian nationality, they should of course be loyal to Indonesia, and at the same time they should of course enjoy the rights of citizens of this country, without any discrimination. Therefore, Overseas Chinese joining the nationality of their country of residence is beneficial to themselves and to their country of residence. In order to eliminate the unreasonable phenomenon of Overseas Chinese having dual nationality, our country and the Indonesian government signed a relevant treaty as early as April 1955. Subsequently, the prime ministers of the two countries exchanged letters on June 3, 1955 on the implementation of this treaty. Two months ago, the foreign ministers of the two countries issued a joint communiqu√©, putting forward clear principles on how to enable the economic strength of Overseas Chinese to continue to play a beneficial role in Indonesia's economic development. If the various principles and methods agreed upon by both parties are effectively implemented and observed, the Overseas Chinese issue could have been gradually resolved reasonably, and the friendly relations between the two countries could have been further developed.
    However, the actual situation is not like this. Recently, not only have anti-Chinese actions appeared on the Indonesian side, but they have turned around and slandered the steps taken by the Chinese government to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese as interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, which is obviously untenable. Everyone knows that China has always been friendly to Indonesia, respects Indonesia's sovereignty and independence, and has always tried its best to provide assistance when Indonesia encounters difficulties. However, Overseas Chinese in Indonesia are now being treated as nationals of hostile countries and subjected to extremely rude and inhumane treatment. May I ask, is this the attitude that friendly countries should take when resolving issues between themselves? Is this in line with the principles of the Bandung Conference?
    As for the economic aspect of the Overseas Chinese issue, everyone knows that the current anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia are being carried out under the pretext of so-called "developing the national economy." Overseas Chinese small vendors are slandered as "remnants of colonial economic" and attacked as hindering the development of Indonesia's national economy, and even venomously cursed as "more vicious than the colonialists." This accusation is obviously inconsistent with historical facts and the current situation. Chinese nationals have resided in Indonesia for more than 1,500 years. From the beginning of the seventeenth century to the middle of the eighteenth century, after the Netherlands occupied Indonesia, a large number of Chinese laborers were abducted by the Dutch colonists to open up colonies for them. In the past hundred years, due to internal and external troubles in our country and the bankruptcy of the countryside, more poor peasants, in order to make a living, did not hesitate to leave their hometowns and wander overseas, thus forming a large population of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The vast majority of these Overseas Chinese are working people, who have long suffered the oppression of the colonialists together with the Indonesian people. Their hard work for generations has made an indelible contribution to Indonesia's economic and cultural development. Speaking of the small vendors who are being persecuted now, their labor and small-scale operations also play an active role in supplying the needs of the local people and enlivening local commodity circulation. May I ask what this has in common with the so-called "colonial economy"? In fact, the Overseas Chinese economy was formed along with the development of the Indonesian national economy, and it has become a component of the Indonesian economy, which is beneficial to the development of the Indonesian national economy. This point is also recognized by Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio. It was clearly mentioned in the joint communiqu√© of the two foreign ministers that "the economic strength of Overseas Chinese will still play a beneficial role in Indonesia's economic development." President Sukarno also announced in his political declaration on August 17: "Non-domestic forces and funds that have settled down in Indonesia, agree and are even prepared to help implement the program of the working cabinet will receive appropriate status and opportunities in our activities to increase industrial and agricultural production." Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that the current anti-Chinese measures in Indonesia directly violate the joint communiqu√© of the two foreign ministers and also violate President Sukarno's political declaration. Today, what truly threatens the development of Indonesia's national economy is the monopoly capital of imperialism, not the Overseas Chinese economy. Dare not touch the former, but concentrate on attacking Overseas Chinese small vendors. Will this bring any benefits to Indonesia's economic development?
    The Chinese government and people cannot but express their utmost concern for the current situation of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Everyone knows that in the era of Old China, the vast majority of Overseas Chinese who wandered overseas were forced to do so for a living, and had to rely on others. In their countries of residence, they often suffered discrimination, abuse, and humiliation from imperialists and local reactionary forces, with no one to complain to, no country to return to, and had to swallow their anger. However, this tragic situation has disappeared since the founding of the People's Republic of China. If there are still people who look at the problem with old eyes, thinking that Overseas Chinese are still as helpless as in the past, with no way out except to seek a living in their countries of residence, and thinking that the Chinese government and 650 million Chinese people will sit idly by and watch Overseas Chinese suffer unwarranted discrimination and persecution overseas, then they are greatly mistaken. The three suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country to Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia are all reasonable. Overseas Chinese who are willing to choose Indonesian nationality should acquire Indonesian nationality in accordance with the treaty between the two countries on the issue of dual nationality; Overseas Chinese who are unwilling or unable to acquire Indonesian nationality should be given due protection; Overseas Chinese who cannot survive in Indonesia or voluntarily return to their country should be repatriated in batches. We hope that the Indonesian government can immediately stop the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese and can quickly reach an agreement with our government on Foreign Minister Chen Yi's suggestions. Based on the friendship with the Indonesian people, our people eagerly hope that the Overseas Chinese issue in Indonesia can be resolved satisfactorily in accordance with the first two suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi, and at the same time express a warm welcome to the Overseas Chinese who request to return to their country. In today's China, 650 million people are developing the motherland's boundless resources with unparalleled enthusiasm and building our beautiful and rich homeland. We want to build a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Although we have 650 million people, we still feel that there is a shortage of labor. Since the founding of our country ten years ago, 300,000 Overseas Chinese have returned to their motherland one after another and participated in the socialist construction of the motherland. After returning to the country, they have been warmly welcomed by the people of the motherland and have been properly arranged and cared for in their lives and work. Many of them have become labor models and heroes in socialist construction, establishing glorious feats for their motherland and future generations. Therefore, in the new era of the motherland's prosperity, the motherland is always opening its warm embrace to all compatriots residing abroad who encounter difficulties or are willing to return for other reasons.
    Now, just as Overseas Chinese in Indonesia are being subjected to unwarranted discrimination and persecution, Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country has formally proposed in his letter to Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia that the Chinese government is prepared to arrange for those Overseas Chinese who are displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia to live in the country according to their wishes to return to the country, giving them the opportunity to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. This suggestion is fully in line with the wishes of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia and is also something that the government of any friendly country has no reason to refuse. At the same time, our welcome to Overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in socialist construction fully demonstrates that the Chinese people have never and will never intend to use Overseas Chinese to harm any country, or to use the so-called "excessive" population to "expand" abroad. This fundamentally shatters the lies spread by imperialism and foreign reactionaries that Overseas Chinese are China's "fifth column" for carrying out subversive activities and that China's population growth will become a "threat" to neighboring Asian countries.
    Of course, the repatriation of a large number of Overseas Chinese is still a complex task, and only with the friendly assistance and cooperation of the Indonesian government and people can these Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return be able to return safely and smoothly. Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country specifically mentioned several hopes in his letter to Foreign Minister Subandrio, which are also completely reasonable. First of all, the return of Overseas Chinese should be voluntary. China is willing to accept Overseas Chinese to return to the country, but it must not be used as a pretext for anti-Chinese activities, and there must not be any coercion. For those Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to the country, their wishes should also be respected and should not be hindered. Good relations back and forth will not harm the friendly feelings of the people of the two countries. Secondly, these Overseas Chinese have resided in Indonesia for generations and have of course established industries, which they have acquired through years of hard work. They have shed a lot of blood and sweat for Indonesia and created a lot of wealth. When they are about to leave Indonesia, the only small amount of property they have should naturally be allowed to be sold and the proceeds should be brought back. Thirdly, their safety on the way back to the country should be guaranteed. Especially in the current situation in Indonesia, where there is a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment, the lives of Overseas Chinese are not guaranteed at all, and raising this point is particularly important. Finally, in order to facilitate our government to orderly settle these returned Overseas Chinese, we also hope that the Indonesian government will repatriate them in batches. This will be convenient for organizing ships and carrying out repatriation and reception in a planned manner. At the same time, it is also easy for the Indonesian government to do. Japan is a defeated aggressor country, and China and Japan have not yet concluded a treaty of peace and established diplomatic relations, but the Chinese government has made every effort to make the most thorough arrangements for the repatriation of Japanese nationals in China. We believe that the Indonesian government, whether proceeding from the friendly relations between the two countries or from the principles of humanity and justice, should not object to these reasonable demands of our government.
    The suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country have provided a reasonable basis for a comprehensive solution to the Overseas Chinese issue existing between China and Indonesia. The Overseas Chinese issue can only be resolved through friendly consultation. Any unilateral and rude approach will only add difficulties to the solution of the problem. The anti-Chinese and anti-China activities currently being incited in Indonesia have also aroused the unease and dissatisfaction of the kind people and fair-minded people of Indonesia. The Jakarta "Dawn Daily" editorial on November 20th said it well: For the situation caused by the anti-Chinese movement in Indonesia, "only those who hoped that Indonesia would fall into chaos from the beginning are happy." It loudly called: "Return to the road of the Bandung Conference"! We sincerely hope that the Indonesian government will value the friendship between China and Indonesia and the solidarity of Asian and African countries, carefully consider the suggestions of Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country, and hold negotiations as soon as possible; at the same time, quickly stop the continued anti-Chinese and anti-China activities in order to create an atmosphere conducive to negotiations. We firmly believe that as long as both sides cherish the desire to maintain the friendly relations between the two countries, the Overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries can be resolved reasonably through friendly consultation. And the rational solution of the Overseas Chinese issue will dispel the temporary dark clouds, make the friendship between China and Indonesia further developed, and make the conspiracy of imperialism and its agents to sow discord between China and Indonesia fail.
