New Uses for Slag Ash

Steel mill slag, steel residue, power plant furnace slag, fly ash, etc., can be made into blocks using steam curing methods, and then used to replace bricks and tiles, and concrete for building various houses. The Ministry of Construction Engineering has decided to promote this in various industrial cities.

The production method is relatively simple: grind slag, furnace slag, fly ash, etc. into powder, add a small amount of lime and raw gypsum, mix with water and heat with steam, and it will solidify into a silicate solid like ceramic or glass. This material can be made into wall blocks the size of ordinary bricks or tabletops, even half-wall sized wall blocks. With steel bars or fiberglass as reinforcement, it can replace concrete to make building beams and roof panels. After adding gravel and glass slag, it can also be ground into a smooth and beautiful floor like terrazzo, and can also be made into plain or colored tiles.

According to preliminary statistics from relevant departments, if all the furnace slag and fly ash from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Fushun each year were utilized, it could build ten million square meters of civil buildings.

    矿碴炉灰的新用途
    钢铁厂的矿碴、钢碴，火力发电厂的炉碴、烟灰等，采用蒸汽养护的方法制成块以后，可以代替砖瓦、混凝土建造各种房屋。建筑工程部决定在各个工业城市推广。
    它的制作方法比较简易：用矿碴、炉碴、烟灰等磨成粉末，加上少量的石灰和生石膏，用水搅拌和蒸汽加热以后，便凝结成像陶瓷、玻璃般的矽酸盐固体。用这种材料，可以制成像普通砖块或桌面以至半面墙那样大的墙壁砌块，加上钢筋或玻璃丝作龙骨，就可以代替混凝土制成建筑物的大梁和屋面板，加上石子、玻璃碴以后，还可以磨制成同水磨石一样光滑美丽的地面，还可以制成素面或彩面的磁砖。
    据有关部门初步统计，如果把上海、天津、抚顺三个城市每年的炉碴、烟灰全部利用起来，可以建造一千万平方米的民用建筑。
