Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, 10th December: The Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project on the Yellow River completed the task of pouring one million cubic meters of concrete for the whole year ahead of schedule on the 9th, creating favorable conditions for the dam to play a full flood control role during next year's flood season.

To ensure the Sanmenxia Dam achieves full flood control during next year's flood season, the dam body must be raised to an elevation of 340 meters above sea level, requiring a total of more than 1.39 million cubic meters of concrete to be poured. The currently completed concrete pouring project accounts for 78.5% of the total required project volume, thus providing a strong foundation for the dam to play a full flood control role during next year's flood season.

From the very beginning of construction, the builders of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project raced against time with heroic strides. In 1958, they completed the comb tooth project ahead of schedule, preparing a new discharge channel for the Yellow River, enabling the project to cut off the Yellow River one dry season ahead of schedule. This year, in order to pour the dam to an elevation of 310 meters above sea level before the flood season, they broke through the monthly concrete pouring target of 100,000 cubic meters from March, raising the dam step by step and retaining the Yellow River's huge flood peaks seven times during the summer flood season. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the production enthusiasm of the workers became even higher. Under the condition that the dam body was gradually raised and the construction conditions became more difficult, the amount of concrete poured in August increased by 23.9% compared with July, September increased by 45.5% compared with August, and October and November continued to increase. In particular, from November 20 to December 10, the average daily pouring volume was more than 5,000 cubic meters in the 20 days. In order to achieve the goal of completing the annual concrete pouring task ahead of schedule, workers in all links, from mining and transporting sand and gravel to mixing concrete, took active actions. The Lingbao Sand and Gravel Plant completed the task of mining 1.5 million cubic meters for the whole year ahead of schedule at the end of November. Workers in the mixing system adopted many measures under the slogan of "Mix Quickly, Unload Quickly" to ensure the early completion of the concrete pouring task.

While completing the concrete pouring task, the annual installation task of 6,500 tons of metal structures, including water pressure steel pipes, large machinery, and trestle bridges, was also completed ahead of schedule. After inspection, the completed concrete pouring projects and installation projects all meet the design standards.

In response to the call of the Party Central Committee on increasing production and practicing economy, the Sanmenxia workers actively carried out technological innovation while completing the annual concrete pouring project and metal structure installation project ahead of schedule, and reduced project costs under the principle of ensuring project quality. For example, after the workers added admixtures such as fly ash, loess, and plasticizers to the concrete to fill the rubble, they saved more than 30,000 tons of cement by the end of October. The amount of cement used per cubic meter of concrete poured was 17.46% lower than the national quota. They also improved the operation methods of machinery and strengthened maintenance, so that the utilization rate of machinery was continuously improved and the cost was continuously reduced. By clearing warehouses and contributing materials, finding substitute materials, and using waste materials, the employees of the units under the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau saved a total of 9.19 million yuan in material costs by the end of October.

### 争取在明年汛期发挥全部拦洪作用  三门峡大坝日日高升  提前完成百万方混凝土浇筑和设备安装

    争取在明年汛期发挥全部拦洪作用
    三门峡大坝日日高升
    提前完成百万方混凝土浇筑和设备安装
    新华社三门峡10日电　黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程在9日提前完成全年浇筑混凝土一百万立方米的任务，为大坝争取在明年汛期时能起到全部拦洪作用创造了有力的条件。
    争取三门峡大坝明年汛期实现全部拦洪，必须使坝体全线升高到拔海三百四十米高程，共需浇筑混凝土一百三十九万多立方米。目前已完成的混凝土浇筑工程，占所需总工程量的78.5％，因此它为大坝在明年汛期起到全部拦洪作用提供了有力条件。
    三门峡水利枢纽工程的建设者从施工一开始就以豪迈的步伐和时间赛跑。1958年，他们提前完成了梳齿工程，给黄河准备了新的下泄河道，使斩断黄河的工程能提前一个枯水季节实现。今年，为了抢在洪水前面把大坝浇筑到拔海三百一十米高程，他们从3月份起就突破了月浇筑混凝土十万立方的指标，使大坝节节上升，在伏汛期间七次滞蓄了黄河的巨大洪峰。中共八届八中全会以后，职工生产情绪更加高涨，在坝体逐渐升高、施工条件更加困难的情况下，混凝土浇筑量8月份比7月份增长了23.9％，9月份比8月份增长了45.5％，10月份、11月份继续增长。特别是11月20日到12月10日二十天中，平均日浇筑量都在五千立方米以上。为了实现提前完成全年混凝土的浇筑任务，从开采、运输砂石一直到拌和混凝土的各环节职工都积极行动起来。灵宝砂石厂在11月底就提前完成了全年开采一百五十万立方米的任务。拌和系统的工人在“拌得快，卸得快”的口号下采取了许多措施，保证了混凝土浇筑任务的提前完成。
    在完成浇筑混凝土任务的同时，全年包括水压钢管、大型机械、栈桥等金属结构的六千五百吨安装任务也提前完成了。经过检查，已完成的混凝土浇筑工程和安装工程都合乎设计标准。
    响应党中央关于增产节约的号召，三门峡职工们在提前完成全年混凝土浇筑工程和金属结构安装工程的同时，积极开展技术革新，在保证工程质量的原则下降低工程成本。如职工们在混凝土中增加粉煤灰、黄土、塑化剂等掺和料填充毛石以后，到10月底共节约水泥三万多吨。每浇筑一方混凝土的水泥用量比国家定额降低17.46％。他们还改进机械的操作方法，加强维修保养，使机械利用率不断提高，费用不断降低。三门峡工程局所属单位职工通过清仓献料、找代用料、利用废旧料等，到10月底共节约材料费用九百一十九万元。（附图片）
