Actively and Proactively Support Agriculture
Yang Yilin, Secretary of the CPC Yangzhou Prefectural Committee Secretariat

    Yangzhou Prefecture is located in central Jiangsu Province and is a major producer of grain, cotton, oil crops, and various cash crops, being one of the province's famous granaries. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the rapid development of agricultural production, the prefecture's local industries have also developed and strengthened themselves in the process of serving agricultural production. In just over a year, 2,870 new and expanded small and medium-sized factories have been built, basically establishing a network for the manufacturing and repair of machinery and farm implements, a network for the production of indigenous fertilizers and pesticides, and a network for the processing of food grains and animal feed. More than 50% of the prefecture's farmland uses electric irrigation, and machinery is partially used for deep plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, transportation, and manure accumulation. The processing of food grains and animal feed is basically mechanized, greatly saving rural labor and creating favorable conditions for the realization of agricultural technical transformation.

    Resolutely Serve Agricultural Production

    Yangzhou Prefecture had a very weak industrial base. There were only 253 factories in nearly 100 towns, of which 70% were seasonal oil and rice processing plants, which were far from meeting the needs of agricultural production development. Since the Great Leap Forward, especially after the people's communes, agriculture needed a large number of water pumps and required industrial departments to help solve the difficulties in farm implement manufacturing and machinery repair, but we couldn't even solve simple repairs. These situations made us deeply realize that local industries must closely follow the pace of agricultural production and unswervingly implement the policy of serving agriculture.

    Regarding the direction of local industrial development, there were different views among some factory leaders. Some people one-sidedly pursued output value and profit, ignoring the service of local industry to agricultural production. When the rural areas were in a state of severe drought, they did not produce water-drawing tools but instead produced furniture with a higher output value. The Yangzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory had been wavering on the issue of whether local industry should serve agriculture, and the signboard had been changed five times. However, each time it proved that when its production was combined with agriculture, it developed; when it abandoned serving agriculture, it encountered difficulties. After several ups and downs, they finally realized that local industries should closely follow agriculture and serve agricultural production.

    Both Production and Repair

    Over the past year, the overall development of local industries in our prefecture has been rapid. However, the speed of industrial development is very uneven between counties and between communes. Many people believe that to accelerate the development of local industry and support agricultural production, large factories must be established immediately to produce large quantities of mechanical farm implements. In their view, small factories that only repair and assemble are not promising; reforming farm implements in a rustic way cannot play a major role. Some people believe that local industries have low technical levels and can only repair and assemble, and cannot accomplish great things. If we follow these people's opinions, the result can only be that large factories cannot be established, and small factories will not be established. Even if they are established, they will not be well run. We resolutely criticized these erroneous opinions.

    Experience tells us that to enable local industries to meet the needs of agricultural development in a faster, better, and more economical way, in terms of industrial development, we must not only give full play to the role of existing small and medium-sized industries, but also seize all favorable conditions to continuously and actively develop and improve them, so that they can gradually undertake more and more and higher and higher tasks. In terms of production arrangements, we must not only ensure the supply of small and medium-sized farm implements, but also actively improve and upgrade existing farm implements, and at the same time actively manufacture new mechanical farm implements. This is the most realistic and correct path. Jiangdu County vigorously established county, commune, and team farm implement factories, ensuring the supply of small and medium-sized farm implements, and upgraded the iron and wood cooperative into a general machinery factory, repairing diesel engines and manufacturing animal-powered harvesters; at the same time, a farm implement experimental factory was specially established, which trial-produced more than 60 kinds of improved farm implements and semi-mechanized farm implements in one year, becoming a base for trial production, research, and promotion of new farm implements in the county. In this way, the potential of small and medium-sized factories was fully tapped, and the creativity and enthusiasm of all parties were mobilized, quickly organizing a powerful local army to support agriculture.

    Ahead of the Season

    How to ensure that the supply of agricultural production materials can be both ahead of the agricultural season and ensure quality? This is also a very acute question. The solution is that we have put forward to the industrial departments the "task of completing the support for agricultural production one quarter in advance," requiring that the products supporting agriculture must "guarantee quality, quantity, time, and repair." However, some factory leaders, although verbally accepting this requirement, often emphasized objective difficulties in their specific work. Some people say that "advance production will disrupt the plan," "advance production will lead to the accumulation of funds and raw materials"; and others say that "to ensure time, quality cannot be guaranteed." These kinds of thoughts once hindered our timely and effective support for agriculture. Last year, when threshers were promoted, some factories were afraid that they would not be sold after production, so they reluctantly started production when the wheat season had already started. By the time they were manufactured, they had already become a "post-mortem remedy," and these threshers had to sleep in the warehouse. These facts show that if production is not arranged in advance, not only will the purpose of supporting agriculture not be achieved, but it will also disrupt the factory's plan, accumulate funds, and affect quality.

    To achieve timely support for agricultural production, it is necessary to frequently organize factory cadres to go deep into the rural areas to investigate the needs for farm implements and widely solicit farmers' opinions on various farm implements. This is an important method for improving production. For this purpose, it is necessary to adopt a method of dividing areas and assigning responsibility, sending workers to the countryside to teach farmers the technology of using tools and repairing tools; it is necessary to educate industrial, commercial, financial, and transportation departments to establish a strong view of serving agricultural production, and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, divide responsibilities, cooperate closely, ensure the timely supply of raw materials, ensure the timely transportation of raw materials and products, and ensure that industrial products are delivered to farmers in a timely manner. Agriculture is seasonal, and only by comprehensively arranging according to the characteristics of the agricultural season, focusing on the needs of agricultural production, comprehensively arranging, grasping the key points, and launching batch attacks to ensure supply can good results be achieved.

    积极主动  支援农业
    中共扬州地委书记处书记　杨易林
    扬州专区位于江苏省中部，盛产粮、棉、油料和多种经济作物，是全省著名的粮仓之一。大跃进以来，随着农业生产的飞跃发展，全区的地方工业，也在为农业生产服务的过程中，发展和壮大了自己。在短短一年多的时间内，新建和扩建了两千八百七十个中小型工厂，基本上建成了机械、农具制造修配网，土化肥、农药制造网，口粮、饲料加工网。全区50％以上的农田采用电力灌溉，深耕、播种、收割、脱粒、运输、积肥等工作部分地采用了机械，口粮和饲料加工基本上用机械操作，大量地节省了农村劳动力，并且为实现农业的技术改造创造了良好的条件。
    坚决为农业生产服务
    扬州专区原有的工业基础十分薄弱，在近一百个城镇之内只有二百五十三个工厂，其中70％是季节性的油米加工厂，远远不能适应农业生产发展的需要。大跃进以来，特别是人民公社化以后，农业需要大量的抽水机，需要工业部门帮助他们解决农具制造和机械修配的困难，而我们却连简单的修配也不能解决。这些情况，都使我们深刻地认识到地方工业必须紧紧跟上农业生产的步伐前进，坚定不移地贯彻为农业服务的方针。
    对于地方工业发展的方向问题，在我们的部分工厂领导干部中是有过不同的看法的。有的人片面地追求产值和利润，忽视地方工业为农业生产服务。农村抗旱十分紧张的时候，他们不生产戽水工具，却去生产产值较高的家具。扬州农业机械厂，在地方工业要不要为农业服务的问题上，就一直摇摆不定，光招牌就换过五次，但是每一次都证明，当它的生产和农业结合起来的时候，就有了发展；甩开为农业服务的时候，就有了困难。经过几起几落的事实教育，他们终于看清了地方工业应当紧紧跟上农业，为农业生产服务。
    既生产　又修配
    一年多来，我们全区的地方工业，总的来说发展是很快的。但是，在县与县之间、公社与公社之间工业发展的速度却很不平衡。有不少人认为，要加快地方工业的发展速度，支持农业生产，就得马上办起大型工厂，生产大批机械农具。在他们看来，小型工厂，修修配配，没有出息；改革农具，土里土气，起不了大作用。有人认为地方工业技术水平低，只能修修配配，办不出大事来。如果照这些人的意见办事，结果只能是大厂办不起，小厂不去办，即使办了也办不好。我们坚决地批判了这些错误意见。
    经验告诉我们，要使地方工业多快好省地满足农业发展的需要，在发展工业方面，既要充分发挥现有中小型工业的作用，又要抓住一切有利条件，不断地、积极地发展和提高，使它们能逐步担当起愈来愈多、愈来愈高的任务。在安排生产方面，既要保证中小型农具的供应，又要积极改进提高现有的农具，同时还要积极制造新式的机械农具，这才是一条最切合实际的正确道路。江都县大办县、社、队农具工厂，保证了中小型农具的供应，又将铁木业合作社提高为通用机械厂，修配柴油机，制造畜力收割机；同时又专门办了一个农具试验工厂，一年当中就试制了六十多种改良农具和半机械化农具，成为全县试制、研究、推广新式农具的基地。这样，就充分挖掘了中小工厂的潜力，把各方面的创造性和积极性都调动起来，迅速地组织成一支强大的支援农业的地方军。
    赶到季节前面
    农业生产资料的供应，如何做到既能赶在农时季节前面，又能保证质量？这也是一个很尖锐的问题。解决的办法，我们向工业部门提出了“提前一个季度完成支援农业生产任务”，要求支援农业的产品一定要“包质量、包数量、包时间、包修理”。但是，有些工厂的领导干部虽然口头上接受了这个要求，而在具体工作中却常常强调客观困难。有人说“提前生产会打乱计划”，“提前生产就会积压资金，积压原材料”；又有人说“要保证时间就不能保证质量”。这种种思想，曾经妨碍了我们及时有效的支援农业。去年推广脱粒机，有些厂怕生产出来卖不掉，到大、元麦已经登场的时候才勉强动手生产，等到制造出来，已经成了“马后炮”，这些脱粒机只好放在仓库里睡觉。这些事实说明了如果不提前安排生产，不但不能达到支援农业的目的，而且也会打乱工厂的计划，积压资金，影响质量。
    要做到及时支援农业生产，需要经常组织工厂干部深入农村，调查农具需要的情况，广泛征求农民对各种农具的意见，这是改进生产的一个重要方法。为此，必须采取划片包干的办法，派工人下乡向农民传授使用工具的技术和修理工具；需要教育工业、商业、财政、交通等部门树立强烈的为农业生产服务的观点，在党委的统一领导下，分工负责，通力协作，保证原材料的及时供应，保证原材料和产品的及时运输，保证工业产品及时送到农民手里。农业是有季节性的，只有根据农时季节特点，围绕农业生产的需要，全面安排，抓住重点，分批突击，保证供应，才能收到良好的效果。
