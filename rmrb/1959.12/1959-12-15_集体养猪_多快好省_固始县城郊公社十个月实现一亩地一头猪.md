    Collective Pig Raising: More, Faster, Better, Economical.
    Gushi County Suburban Commune Achieves One Pig Per Mu in Ten Months
    (By Our Newspaper) The Chengguan People's Commune in Gushi County, Henan Province, resolutely implemented the policy of collective raising as the primary method, supplemented by private raising, and launched a "Ten Thousand, Thousand, Hundred" pig raising campaign. The total number of pigs in the commune increased from over 20,000 in February of this year to 66,970 by the end of November, achieving one pig per mu of land. Among them, collectively raised pigs accounted for 89.8%.
    In February of this year, when the commune began to implement the policy of collective raising as the primary method, supplemented by private raising, there was a fierce debate. At that time, a few people suggested that "collectively raised pigs do not grow as fast or get as fat as privately raised pigs." "If pig farms are built too large and swine fever occurs, it will be like 'Old Wang selling gypsum, losing both capital and profit'." Therefore, their conclusion was: "Collective raising is not as good as private raising, and raising fewer pigs is better than raising more." Some also emphasized the lack of equipment, pig sources, and feed, making it impossible to build large-scale pig farms. However, the majority opposed these ideas. The commune Party committee organized cadres and the masses to carry out a major debate on the two roads and two lines in pig raising, raising the questions: "Is collective raising better, or is private raising better?" "Is raising more pigs better, or is raising fewer pigs better?" "Are the difficulties in running collective pig farms insurmountable?" The commune Party committee summarized the facts of several brigades that had successfully run collective pig farms in the past, educating cadres and the masses. For example, the Guanmiao Brigade established a hundred-pig farm in the spring of 1958. After the commune was established, the brigade established a thousand-pig farm, and the production team established a hundred-pig farm. The number of pigs increased from 270 at the beginning of the year to 1,143 by the end of the year (excluding privately raised pigs). Because they paid special attention to pig epidemic prevention and hygiene, the collectively raised pigs were safe and sound, and not a single one died, even when swine fever was prevalent at the time. This vivid fact eloquently proved that collective raising, as long as scientific management is strengthened, will not only not cause a large number of deaths, but can also reduce or even eliminate the phenomenon of death. The Yangguan Brigade, due to its strong enthusiasm and reliance on the masses, built thousand-pig farms and hundred-pig farms in a simple and resourceful way, using local materials. The number of pigs increased more than threefold from 370 at the beginning of 1958 to nearly one pig per mu of land by the end of 1958. These facts powerfully criticized various erroneous ideas and summarized the five major advantages of collective pig raising. First, more: more pigs are raised. Hundred-pig farms, thousand-pig farms, and ten-thousand-pig farms have opened up vast space for the large-scale development of collective pig raising. Second, faster: faster breeding of piglets. Communes and brigades raise sows and run breeding farms on a large scale, developing rapidly. Third, better: better feeding. Collective pig raising can be scientifically managed. Fourth, more economical: saving labor, equipment, feed, and funds. Collective pig raising allows one person to feed a hundred pigs, and a pig shed can hold hundreds of pigs. Moreover, with more pigs, there is no worry about food, and feed is not wasted. Fifth, increasing: increasing grain production, increasing collective economic income, and increasing commune members' income. The Wulingsi Brigade used to be a well-known "poor temple team" with very low grain yields per unit area. Before 1958, it had to rely on state unified sales of large quantities of grain and loans for relief every year. This year, after vigorously promoting pig raising and manure accumulation, with more pigs and more manure, the average wheat and rice yields per mu increased from 180 jin and 370 jin last year to 476 jin and 863 jin, respectively. This changed the face of the poor team and caught up with the general rich teams.
    Through this major debate, cadres and commune members further realized the benefits of collective raising and launched a mass movement to build ten-thousand-pig farms, thousand-pig farms, and hundred-pig farms. The first secretary of the commune Party committee personally led this movement. The Party committee established a construction committee, transferred 17,000 laborers, and rushed to build farms in a simple and resourceful way, using local materials. To solve the problem of pig sources, they adopted the method of self-breeding and self-raising. Communes and brigades established a total of thirteen breeding farms, adopting the method of "keeping all females and selecting later" to greatly develop the sow herd. The number of sows quickly increased from 1,400 last year to the current 5,860, producing 35,000 piglets in the first half of the year alone.
    Collective raising initially lacked experience in feeding and management, resulting in some deaths and emaciation. The commune Party committee conducted serious investigations and studies and made specific analyses, finding four reasons: First, large pigs, sows, and piglets were fed together, and piglets and weak pigs were not full, and some piglets were even crushed to death by large pigs. Second, epidemic prevention work was poor, and sick pigs were not isolated and treated in time, leading to mutual infection. Third, malnutrition caused emaciation. Fourth, feeders were not assigned fixed responsibilities, resulting in poor management. Based on these situations, the commune Party committee immediately took a series of effective measures, separating large pigs, sows, and piglets for feeding; feeding according to the characteristics of sows, piglets, medium-sized pigs, and fattening pigs, with fixed quality, quantity, and timing; fixing epidemic prevention personnel in each pig farm, establishing sick pig isolation rooms, and regularly inspecting and injecting each pig with preventive vaccines; fixing personnel for feeding, feed processing, and feed collection, and strengthening political work to enhance their sense of responsibility. After adopting these methods, the pig farms basically eliminated pig deaths, and the survival rate of pigs in the commune reached 98%. Now, piglets generally only take five months to grow into large, fat pigs after weaning.
    As collective pig farms became larger and more numerous, some people shouted that there were too few people to manage them and demanded a large increase in feeding and management personnel. The commune Party committee held an on-site meeting on high-efficiency pig feeding at the Dazhai Brigade's thousand-pig farm, promoting the experience of the brigade in increasing the number of pigs while reducing the number of feeders. This farm raised 1,143 pigs, which initially kept 30 people busy. Later, they established a feed processing plant by the Shahe River, using water power to drive four millstones, which could process 12,000 jin of feed per day, enough to feed the pigs and have reserves. In terms of tools for cooking pig feed, they created the "Double Hall Eight Pot" Great Leap Forward stove, with one person cooking enough feed for more than 1,000 pigs. At the same time, they also realized the motorization of feed transportation and the self-flowing of water. These reforms not only greatly reduced the labor intensity of the feeders but also saved 18 laborers. Now, only 12 people feed more than 1,500 pigs, with each person feeding an average of more than 100 pigs. After the commune promoted this pig farm's experience in vigorously reforming feeding tools, it not only did not increase the number of feeders but also reduced it by 934 compared to last year, despite the great development of pig raising.

    集体养猪　多快好省
    固始县城郊公社十个月实现一亩地一头猪
    本报讯　河南固始县城郊人民公社坚决贯彻执行了以集体饲养为主，私人饲养为辅的方针，开展养猪的“万、千、百”运动，全社的猪由今年2月的二万多头，到11月底发展到六万六千九百七十头，实现了一亩地一头猪。其中集体饲养的占89.8％。
    今年2月，这个公社在开始贯彻执行以集体饲养为主，私人饲养为辅的方针时，曾经有一场激烈的争论。当时有少数人提出“集体养猪没有私人喂猪长得快，喂得肥。”“猪场办大了，发生猪瘟，就‘老王卖石膏，本利一齐消’”。因此，他们的结论是：“集体养不如私人养，多养不如少养。”也有人强调缺设备，少猪源，没饲料，无法大建猪场。但大多数人却反对这些思想观点。公社党委组织干部和群众开展养猪工作两条道路、两条路线的大争大辩，提出“是集体饲养为主好，还是私人饲养为主好？”“是多养好，还是少养好？”“办集体养猪场有困难，能不能克服？”公社党委总结了几个大队过去办好集体猪场的事实，教育了干部、群众。如官庙大队在1958年春办了一个百头猪场；公社化后，大队办了千头猪场，生产队办了百头猪场，猪由年初二百七十头，到年底发展到一千一百四十三头（不包括私养）。由于他们特别注意了猪的防疫卫生，在当时猪瘟流行的情况下，集体饲养的猪，却安然无恙，没死一头。这一生动的事实雄辩地证明：集体饲养，只要加强科学管理，不仅不会造成大量死亡，反而能减少甚至消灭死亡现象。杨关大队由于干劲足，依靠群众，因陋就简，就地取材，大办千头猪场、百头猪场，猪由1958年初三百七十头，到1958年底增加了三倍多，将近达到一亩地一头猪。通过这些事实有力地批判了各种错误思想，并总结出集体养猪有五大优越性。一多：就是养猪多。百头猪场、千头猪场、万头猪场，为大量发展集体养猪开辟了广阔的天地。二快：就是仔猪繁殖快。公社、大队饲养母猪，大办繁殖场，发展迅速。三好：喂养好。集体养猪可以进行科学管理。四省：省劳力、设备、饲料和资金。集体养猪，一人可以喂养一百头，一个猪棚可以关几百头，且猪多不嫌吃，不会浪费饲料。五增加：可以增产粮食，增加社有经济，增加社员收入。五良寺大队原来是个有名的“穷庙队”，粮食单位面积产量很低，1958年前连年要国家统销大批粮食和发放贷款救济。今年大搞养猪积肥后，猪多肥多，小麦、水稻平均亩产分别由去年的一百八十斤、三百七十斤增加到四百七十六斤、八百六十三斤。从而改变了穷队面貌，赶上了一般富队。
    通过这次大辩论，干部、社员进一步看清了集体饲养的好处，掀起了一个大办万头猪场、千头猪场、百头猪场的群众运动。公社党委第一书记亲自领导了这一运动，党委成立了建场委员会，抽调了一万七千个劳力，因陋就简，就地取材，突击建场。在解决猪源问题上，采取自繁自养的办法，公社、大队共建立了十三个繁殖场，采取“见雌必留、先留后选”的办法，大量发展母猪群。母猪就很快由去年的一千四百头发展到现在的五千八百六十头，仅上半年就生产仔猪三万五千头。
    集体饲养，开始饲养管理没经验，出现了一些死亡、瘦弱现象。公社党委认真进行了调查研究，具体分析，有四个原因：一、大猪、母猪、小猪挤在一起喂养，小猪、弱猪吃不饱，甚至有仔猪被大猪压死现象；二、防疫工作做得差，病猪没及时隔离、治疗，以致互相传染；三、营养不良，造成瘦弱；四、饲养员没有固定分工，管理不善。公社党委根据这些情况，立即采取了一系列的有效措施，把大猪、母猪、小猪分群喂养；根据母猪、仔猪、中猪、肥猪的特点，喂食定质、定量、定时；各猪场固定防疫员，建立病猪隔离室，定期给每头猪检查注射防疫针；固定喂养、饲料加工、采集饲料的人员，并加强政治工作，提高责任感。各场采取这些办法后，基本上消灭了猪的死亡现象，全社猪的成活率达到98％；现在，仔猪断奶后，一般只要五个月时间，就可养成大肥猪。
    集体养猪场办大了，办多了，有的人就叫喊人少管不了，要求大量增加饲养管理人员。公社党委在大寨大队千头猪场召开了高工效喂猪的现场会，推广这个大队猪增加了，饲养员反而减少了的经验。这个场养猪一千一百四十三头，原先三十个人还忙不过来，以后他们在沙河边建立了饲料加工厂，利用水力带动四盘碾子，一天可加工饲料一万二千斤，除够猪吃外还有贮备。在煮猪食工具上，创造了“双堂八锅”跃进灶，一人煮饲料，够一千多头猪吃。同时还实现了运送饲料车子化，用水自流化。这些改革不仅大大减轻了饲养员的劳动强度，而且节省十八个劳力。现在全场只十二人，喂着一千五百多头猪，每人平均喂猪一百多头。全社推广这个猪场大搞饲养工具改革的经验后，不但没有增加饲养人员，而且在养猪大发展的情况下，还比去年减少了九百三十四名。（附图片）
