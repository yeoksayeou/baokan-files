Ambitious and Resourceful
Lin Xi

“No daughter should marry into Gaoshanling, for endless suffering will be their fate.” This was the past perception of impoverished high mountain areas. However, there were also those who believed that mountainous areas were "money trees," "treasure troves," and "gold and silver mountains." Heeding the Party's instructions and relying on the masses, they started from scratch and ultimately used the fruits of their own labor to shatter the fatalistic notion that high and cold mountainous areas were "barren mountains and treacherous waters." Hou Tingren, the Communist Party member who led the comprehensive development of the mountainous areas in Zhuxi Comprehensive Farm in Hubei, is one of these heroic model figures. There are many things to learn from heroic model figures, and their ambition and resourcefulness are particularly worthy of study. Sanhe Township, a desolate high and cold mountainous area bordering the three provinces of Hubei, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, is more than 2,000 meters above sea level. People have always migrated from here to the plains, but Hou Tingren accepted the Party's mission and moved here from elsewhere to settle down, determined to raise the banner of mountain construction here. When they started the farm, they had only seven people, fifty or so mu of thin mountain slopes, and four dilapidated thatched huts. At that time, some people said: Without the government providing people and money, nothing can be accomplished in mountainous areas. But Hou Tingren was ambitious, he based his work on self-reliance. They worked hard with their own hands, and cooperated with the local masses for labor exchange. In the second year, in addition to being self-sufficient in grain, they also sold 30,000 jin of grain to the state. With the money from the grain sales, they added farm tools and plowing cattle. After seven years of arduous management, they finally opened the treasure house of the mountainous area, and painted the newest and most beautiful picture on this barren land: The seven people expanded to more than 280 people, the four dilapidated thatched houses became 300 new houses, livestock were in abundance, medicinal materials filled the gardens, and factories were also established. Grain production increased year after year... In this way, they created a large amount of wealth for the country with their bare hands, and built a prosperous and comprehensively developed farm in the high and cold mountainous area.

With ambition comes resourcefulness. "Using the farm to support the farm, using the small to nurture the large, using the near to support the far" is Hou Tingren's key to self-reliantly developing the mountain economy, and also the crystallization of his mountain management experience. "Using the farm to support the farm" means taking materials locally and producing locally, implementing the policy of self-reliance; in terms of steps, first grasp the small and near, and then develop into the large and far, which is "using the small to nurture the large, using the near to support the far." For example, in 1952, they only managed more than fifty mu of mountain land; after two consecutive bumper harvests in 1953, they set up pig farms and livestock farms; with the development of pigs, cattle, and sheep, income increased, and various processing plants were set up one after another... In this way, one nurtured two, two nurtured four, and four nurtured eight, achieving the goal of comprehensive development of the mountainous area. This kind of "using the farm to support the farm" self-reliance method is very good and deserves to be greatly promoted.

Now, Zhuxi Comprehensive Farm has become a red flag for the development of production in the mountainous areas of Hubei, and many farmers are striving to become "Hou Tingren-style" figures. Some areas have basically caught up with Zhuxi Comprehensive Farm. We believe that the more "Hou Tingren-style" figures there are, the faster the face of the barren mountainous areas will change, and the better the lives of the people in the mountainous areas will become.

    有志气　有办法
    林晰
    “有女不嫁高山岭，说起苦情道不尽。”这是过去人们对贫困的高山地区的观念。但是也有那么一些人，认为山区是“摇钱树”、“万宝山”、“金银山”，他们听从党的指示，依靠群众，白手起家，终于用自己双手劳动的成绩，打垮了所谓高寒山区是“穷山恶水”的宿命论调。领导湖北竹溪综合农场全面开发山区的共产党员侯廷仁，就是这些英雄模范人物中的一个。英雄模范人物有许多东西值得我们学习，其中特别值得学习的是他们的志气和办法。三合乡，这个湖北、陕西、四川三省交界荒无人烟的高寒山区，拔海两千多米，人们历来是向平原迁移的，而侯廷仁接受党的任务，却从外面迁到这里来安家落户，立志要在这里竖起山区建设的旗帜。他们开始办场时只有七个人，五十多亩山坡薄地，四间破草屋。当时有人说：不靠政府出人出钱，在山区什么事也办不成。但是侯廷仁有志气，他把工作放在自力更生的基础上，他们用自己的双手勤劳生产，和当地群众协作换工，第二年除去口粮自给，还卖给国家三万斤粮食，用卖粮得的钱，添置了农具、耕牛。经过七年的艰辛经营，终于打开了山区的宝库，在这荒山辟壤画出了最新最美的图画：七个人扩大到二百八十多人，四间破草房变成了三百间新屋，牲畜成群、药材满园、工厂也办起来了，粮食连年增产……。他们就这样赤手空拳地为国家创造出大量的财富，在高寒山区建成了百业兴旺综合发展的农场。
    有志气就有办法。“以场养场、以小养大、以近养远”，是侯廷仁自力更生开发山区经济的钥匙，也是他治山经验的结晶。“以场养场”，就是就地取材，就地生产，实现自力更生的方针；在步骤上，先抓小的、近的，然后发展成大的、远的，也就是“以小养大，以近养远。”例如，1952年，他们只经营了五十多亩山地；1953年后连续两季丰收，这时就办起养猪场、畜牧场；随着猪、牛、羊的发展，增加了收入，先后又办起各种加工厂……。就这样一养二、二养四、四养八，达到了全面开发山区的目的。这种“以场养场”自力更生的办法好得很，值得大大推广。
    现在，竹溪综合农场已经成为湖北山区发展生产的一面红旗，许多农民争当“侯廷仁式”的人物，有的地区已经基本上赶上了竹溪综合农场。我们相信，“侯廷仁式”的人物越多，贫瘠山区的面貌就会改变得越快，山区人民的生活就会越来越好。（附图片）
