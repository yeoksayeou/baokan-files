　　Who is Clever? Who is Foolish?
　　Xu Jiachang
　　Whenever I hear those people in the countryside with "three extra chambers in their hearts" making sarcastic remarks, pointing fingers, and saying "So-and-so is single-minded," "So-and-so's mind is dead," "So-and-so is a silly boy," I get angry. I think to myself: "So you think you're so clever, huh!?"
　　In theory, it is possible to use "clever" and "foolish" to evaluate people. However, the "cleverness" and "foolishness" these people speak of are different from what we mean, despite using the same words.
　　These people believe: whoever has more "chambers in their heart," whoever is more "crafty," is clever; whoever has fewer "chambers in their heart," whoever is more "honest," is a fool. We believe: whoever is wholeheartedly devoted to the collective, works with great enthusiasm, tries every means possible, and is skillful and ingenious, is clever; whoever is half-hearted towards the Party, selfish and self-serving, short-sighted, and cannot see the bright future of socialism, is a fool. True cleverness means taking the collective as one's home, being of one heart with the Party, speaking the truth, upholding justice, working hard and cleverly, contributing to the country, and willingly sacrificing oneself for the public good.
　　Since our views on people are different, our evaluations of them are also different. What everyone sees as good, they say is bad; what everyone sees as "clever," they see as "foolish"; what everyone smells as fragrant, they smell as foul. Just like the right-leaning opportunists within the Party who represent the interests of the bourgeoisie, we say "the Great Leap Forward is very good," and they say "feverish" and "carried away." It's as if no one is as clever as they are.
　　Why do these people with "three extra chambers in their hearts" have different views on people than we do? This is because our stances are different. We look at people from a socialist standpoint, starting from the interests of the collective. They look at people with the old eyes of the private ownership system of the old society, starting from personal interests. Those who are wearing old-fashioned glasses should open their eyes wide and see: today is a socialist society of collective happiness! Old viewpoints should be discarded! You think you are clever, but this is selfishness. If all Chinese peasants were this kind of "clever," only calculating within their own small circles, only caring about the warmth of their own beds, socialism would be undermined. Now society has changed, and people's views on others have also changed. Whoever does not seek personal gain but considers the collective is glorious, is a good person, is clever. Those old viewpoints that look at people from the perspective of personal interests have long been seen by everyone as dishwater, both sour and muddy.
　　We have only one "chamber in our heart," a socialist "chamber in our heart," not as many as your "chambers in your heart," which are multiple capitalist "chambers in your heart"; our "chamber in our heart" is dead, wholeheartedly following the Communist Party, listening to the Party's words, not as lively as your "chamber in your heart," which is always trying to take the capitalist road back. We see far, communism is mankind's paradise of happiness; we see correctly, only with the "Great Leap Forward" can China get rid of its "poor and blank" poverty-stricken face. The collective comes first, then the individual; for the sake of the collective, I also have a share in the collective. Let's work, no matter how we work, it is for our working people, not for the interests of the exploiters. We are the most clever, we put our energy into the socialist collective interest. Putting our strength into the socialist cause without hesitation, this is not foolish, it is concerted effort to accelerate socialist construction, it is a capable and efficient expert, only those who are unwilling to walk on the bright road of socialism, whose minds are confused by the capitalist ghosts, are fools.

　　谁精？谁傻？
　　徐家常
    我在农村一听到那些长着“仨心眼”的人冷言讽语，指指点点地说“谁谁是一个心眼的”，“谁的心眼死”，“谁是傻小子”，我就生气。心里想：“就你精，哼！？”
    论说，是可以拿“精”和“傻”来品论人的。不过，那些人所说的“精傻”和咱们说的“精傻”，可是字同意不同。
    这些人认为：谁“心眼”多，谁“鬼”，谁就是精明；谁“心眼”少，谁“实”，谁就是傻瓜。我们认为：谁一心为集体，干劲大，千方百计，心灵手巧，谁就是精明；谁和党三心二意，自私自利，鼠目寸光，看不到社会主义的光明前途，谁就是傻瓜。真正的精明，是以社为家，跟党一条心，说实话，讲公理，苦干巧钻，为国家出力，甘心舍己为公。
    既然对人的看法不一样，品论起人来也就不一样。大伙看着好的，他说是坏的；大伙看着是“精”的，他看着是“傻”的；大伙嗅着香，他嗅着臭。就像党内代表资产阶级利益的右倾机会主义分子一样，咱说“大跃进好得很”，他们说“狂热”、“冲昏了头脑”。好像谁也不如他们精明。
    这些长着“仨心眼”的人和我们为什么对人的看法不一样呢？这就是立场不同。站在社会主义立场上看人，从集体利益出发。用旧社会私有制度的那一套老眼光看人，从私人利益出发。那些戴着老花眼镜的人，应该睁大眼睛看看：今天是社会主义集体幸福的社会了！老观点应该作废了！你觉得你精明，可这是自私。中国农民要全像这样的“精”，光在自己小圈子打算盘，光顾自己的炕头热，社会主义就要拆台。现在社会变了，人们看人的观点也变了，谁要是不图私利，为集体着想，谁就是光荣，谁就是好样的，谁就是精明。像那号从私人利益看待人的旧观点，早被大家看作是刷碗的泔水，又酸又浑（昏）的了。
    我们就是一个“心眼”，一个社会主义“心眼”，不如你“心眼”多，多个资本主义“心眼”；我们的“心眼”死，死心塌地跟着共产党走，听党的话，不如你“心眼”活，老是活动走资本主义回头路。我们看的远，共产主义是人类幸福的天堂；看的对，只有“大跃进”，中国才能摆脱“一穷二白”的贫困面貌。先有集体，后有个人；为了集体，集体也有我的一份。干吧，无论怎样干，是为了我们劳动人民，不是为了剥削者的利益。我们是最精明的，我们把精力放在社会主义集体利益上。为了社会主义奋不顾身的出力气，这不是傻，是齐心合力的加速社会主义建设，是精明强干的能手，只有那些放着社会主义的光明大道不愿走，被资本主义阴魂迷了心窍的人，才是傻瓜一个。
