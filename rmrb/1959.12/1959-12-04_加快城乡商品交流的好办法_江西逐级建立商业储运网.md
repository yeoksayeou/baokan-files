A Good Way to Speed Up the Exchange of Goods Between Urban and Rural Areas
Jiangxi Establishes Commercial Storage and Transportation Networks Level by Level
Three Major Benefits
Combination of Commerce and Transportation Departments
Combination of Long-Distance and Short-Distance Transportation
Combination of Commodity Storage and Transportation

(Our dispatch from Nanchang, December 3rd) Strengthening transit work and accelerating the circulation of commodities between urban and rural areas - Jiangxi is establishing commercial storage and transportation networks level by level. Currently, nearly one million tons of agricultural and sideline products from all over the province have been rapidly transported to cities and industrial and mining areas inside and outside the province through the transit and distribution of the storage and transportation network, while also delivering more than 800,000 tons of production and living materials from urban industrial and mining areas to the countryside.

Sixty percent of Jiangxi Province is mountainous, and transportation is very inconvenient. For years, large quantities of industrial and agricultural products have had to undergo two or three short-distance aggregations and intermediate transits before they can be sent to urban industrial and mining areas and rural areas. Since the beginning of this year, with the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, larger quantities of means of production and living, as well as agricultural and sideline products, have been concentrated along transportation lines and aggregation points, urgently awaiting distribution and transfer.

In accordance with the rapidly growing needs of urban and rural material exchange, the province's commercial departments have, since last year, drawn more than 4,000 storage and transportation personnel from the business system to go deep into mountainous areas and along major land and water transportation routes to set up commercial storage and transportation institutions to strengthen the transit of material transportation. By July of this year, the province's commercial departments, in accordance with the principles of "centralized leadership, unified planning, hierarchical management, separate accounting, integration of administration and enterprise, and integration of storage and transportation," had established commercial storage and transportation management institutions level by level; and had established 531 storage and transportation stations or storage and transportation groups managed at the provincial, special district, and county (city) levels in transportation hubs, short-distance aggregation points, and transportation checkpoints within the province, and equipped basic-level state-owned stores with cadres to manage storage and transportation work, to jointly carry out the aggregation, transit, and distribution of industrial and agricultural products. The specific division of labor is as follows: Provincial commercial departments have set up ten storage and transportation stations in important material distribution centers throughout the province and in locations responsible for material transit between two or more special districts, responsible for the province-wide or inter-special district material aggregation and transfer, forming the first storage and transportation network; administrative regions and commercial departments of various special districts have set up 23 storage and transportation stations in transit distribution and aggregation points in several counties, responsible for regional or inter-county aggregation and transfer work, forming the second storage and transportation network, and directly contacting the provincial storage and transportation network; county (city) commercial departments have also set up 498 storage and transportation points (groups) in their own aggregation and transfer locations, responsible for county-wide or inter-commune material aggregation and transfer work, and directly contacting the special district storage and transportation network, forming the third storage and transportation network. At the same time, when setting up storage and transportation stations (points) in various places, storage and transportation stations (points) were also set up on five lines: river-sea combined transport, water-land combined transport, transit distribution, long-distance and short-distance connection, and out-of-province receiving, so that they are connected to each other. In this way, a commercial storage and transportation network has been formed with stations in transportation hubs, points in aggregation areas, and vertical and horizontal connections.

The establishment of the commercial storage and transportation network has three main benefits:

Combination of Commerce and Transportation: Through the storage and transportation network, commercial departments and transportation departments have achieved closer links, changing the past phenomenon of temporary arrival of goods, temporary loading and unloading, and temporary distribution and consignment. It is also convenient for both commercial and transportation parties to strengthen planning, ensuring that materials can be quickly loaded, unloaded, and transferred upon arrival, thereby reducing material backlog time. Since the establishment of the storage and transportation network throughout the province, the commodity circulation time has generally been accelerated by one to seven days. Compared to July, the commodity transit volume in October increased by more than 42%.

Combination of Long-Distance and Short-Distance: After the establishment of the storage and transportation network, the provincial, special district, and county-level storage and transportation stations (points) form a whole, with unified command and convenient communication, so that the storage and transportation stations are clear about the long-distance and short-distance transportation, thereby enabling them to rationally organize commodity transfer work and closely connect long-distance and short-distance, avoiding the disconnection of long-distance and short-distance. In just three months and twenty days from August to the present, short-distance transportation has transferred and transported 600,000 tons of agricultural and sideline products through the storage and transportation network, accounting for 60% of the annual transit and transfer task.

Combination of Storage and Transportation: A total of 570,000 square meters of commercial warehouse area have been established in storage and transportation stations (points) throughout the province. This ensures that large quantities of agricultural and sideline products can be stored in warehouses after entering the station, which is convenient for storage and avoids losses such as mold and deterioration of materials due to temporary arrival of goods and temporary arrangement of locations in the past. Warehouses in storage and transportation stations (points) throughout the province often have 300,000 to 400,000 tons of materials stored and transferred, and the loss rate has decreased by 42.42% compared to before the storage and transportation network was built.

    加快城乡商品交流的好办法
    江西逐级建立商业储运网
    三大好处
    商业与交通部门结合
    长途与短途运输结合
    商品储存与运输结合
    本报南昌3日电　加强中转工作，加速城乡商品流转——江西逐级建立商业储运网。目前，全省各地近百万吨农副产品，通过储运网中转分拨，已迅速运往省内外城市和工矿，同时并把城市工矿八十多万吨生产资料和生活资料送到农村。
    江西省60％都是山区，交通很不方便，历年来，大批工农业产品，都要经过两三次以上的短途集并和中间运转，才能分别送到城市工矿和农村。今年以来，随着工农业生产的继续跃进，数量更多的生产资料和生活资料以及农副产品纷纷集中到交通沿线和集并地点，急待分拨转运。
    根据迅速增长着的城乡物资交流的需要，全省商业部门去年以来，即从业务系统抽调了四千多名储运工作人员，深入山区、深入水陆交通要道，设置商业储运机构，加强物资调运的中转工作。到今年7月为止，全省商业部门按照“集中领导、统一规划、分级管理、分别核算、行企合一、储运合一”的原则，逐级建立了商业储运管理机构；并在省内交通枢纽、短途集并点和交通关口，分别建立了五百三十一个省、专、县（市）三级管理的储运站或储运组，在基层国营商店也配备了管理储运工作干部，共同进行工农业产品的集并、中转和分拨调运工作。其具体分工情况是：省级商业部门在全省重要的物资集散地以及担负两个专区以上的物资中转地点，设立了十个储运站，负责全省性的或专区之间的物资集并和转运，组成第一道储运网；行政区和各个专区商业部门，又在若干县的中转分拨和集并点，分别设立了二十三个储运站，负责全区性的或县与县之间的集并、转运工作，组成第二道储运网，并与省级储运网直接联系；县（市）商业部门也在自己的境内集并、转拨地点，设立了四百九十八个储运点（组），负责全县性的或公社与公社之间的物资集并、转运工作，并直接与专区储运网联系，组成第三道储运网。同时，各地在设置储运站（点）时，还在江河联运、水陆联运、中转分拨、长短途衔接、省外接运等五条线上设立了储运站（点），使其互相衔接。这样，便形成了一个交通枢纽有站、集并地区有点、纵横串联、脉脉相通的商业储运网。
    商业储运网的建立，有三个主要好处：
    商交结合：通过储运网，商业部门与交通部门取得了更为紧密的联系，改变了过去临时到货临时装卸、临时分拨托运等现象。同时也便于商交双方加强计划性，保证物资一到即能迅速装卸、转运，从而减少了物资积压时间。全省建立储运网以后，商品流转时间一般都加快了一到七天。以10月份和7月份相比，10月份商品中转调运量就比7月份增加了42％以上。
    长途与短途结合：储运网建立以后，省专县三级储运站（点）就形成了一个整体，指挥既统一，联系也方便，达到储运站对长途、短途运输心中有数，从而能合理地组织商品调运工作，使长途与短途紧密衔接起来，避免长短途脱节。仅8月到现在的三个月零二十天时间，短途运输通过储运网中转调运出来的农副产品即达六十万吨，占全年中转调运任务的60％。
    储存与运输结合：全省各地储运站（点）中，共建立了商业仓库面积达五十七万平方米。保证大批农副产品进站后，都能储存入库，便于保管，避免了过去临时到货，临时安排地点，致使物资霉烂变质等损耗。全省各地储运站（点）的仓库内经常有三四十万吨物资储存转运，而损耗率则比建成储运网前下降了42.42％。（附图片）
