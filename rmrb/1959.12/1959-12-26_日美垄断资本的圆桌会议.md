　　Roundtable Conference of Japanese and American Monopoly Capital
　　Wan Feng
    Following the "trade liberalization" offensive launched by the United States against Japan at the Tokyo meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the "International Commerce" group, an overseas expansion organization of American monopoly capital, launched a new offensive against Japan, holding a secret "International Commerce Japan-U.S. Roundtable Conference" in Tokyo in late November. Japanese newspapers called this meeting the "investment liberalization" offensive launched by the United States against Japan—American monopoly capital demanded the removal of all obstacles and unrestricted entry into the Japanese economy.
    Since the spring of this year, the United States has been constantly demanding that Japan open the door wider for further penetration of Japanese economy by American capital. On May 2 this year, the then Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tatsunosuke Takasaki, said after returning from a visit to the United States: "The United States is unexpectedly vociferous in its call that ‘Japan's capital market must be opened to foreign countries’; they even accuse Japan of cooperating with them in Southeast Asia on the one hand, and strictly restricting American investment in Japan on the other, which is regrettable." On November 5, US Assistant Secretary of Commerce Kearns more bluntly stated in a speech at the Tokyo "American Club": "Japan should more freely import American private capital." According to Japanese newspapers, the issue discussed most at this roundtable conference was American investment in Japan. Representatives of American monopoly organizations made extensive contacts with incumbent officials such as Nobusuke Kishi and leaders of various Japanese monopoly organizations, exerting tremendous pressure on the Japanese side to abolish obstacles restricting foreign investment. The "Asahi Shimbun" said that they "fiercely criticized Japanese laws restricting foreign investment and restricting foreign remittances." There are also reports that the United States not only wants the Japanese government to amend the "Foreign Investment Law" and the "Foreign Exchange Control Law," which have certain restrictive effects on foreign investment, but also to fundamentally revise the "Anti-Monopoly Law" and enact laws prohibiting strikes.
    In recent years, American monopoly capital has increasingly controlled Japan's national economy. According to survey data from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the Bank of Japan cited by the "Asahi Shimbun" on December 15 this year, the total amount of foreign monopoly capital invested in Japan in the ten years from 1949 to October 1959 was 261.7 billion yen, which, at an exchange rate of one to three hundred and sixty, is equivalent to 727 million US dollars. The vast majority of this is American capital. From 1950 to September 1958, in approximately eight years, Japan imported a total of US$450 million in American capital from the World Bank, the US Export-Import Bank, and US commercial banks. If other investments are added, the current estimate is more than US$500 million.
    Although American capital accounts for a large proportion of foreign investment in Japan, in reality, direct American private investment (including shares, joint ventures, and equipment investment, etc.) is not much. This is because the forces of the Japanese people striving for independence, peace, and democracy have developed to a greater extent after the war, and the Japanese people resolutely oppose the policy of the Japanese reactionary ruling group of relying on the United States, which has deterred American private capital. Another reason is that the "Foreign Exchange Control Law" and "Foreign Investment Law" promulgated in Japan around 1950 have played a certain restrictive role in the intrusion of foreign monopoly capital. According to statistics from the United Nations, American monopoly enterprises' direct investment in Japan is not only less than that in West Germany, but even less than that in the Philippines. American private direct investment in West Germany in 1957 was 424.4 million US dollars, but in 1958 it was only 182.2 million US dollars in Japan. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the representatives of American monopoly capital who attended this roundtable conference bluntly stated that they wanted to "enter Japanese enterprises in the form of acquiring 100% of the shares," that is, to comprehensively control Japanese enterprises through large-scale investment. So, why is American monopoly capital now eager to infiltrate the Japanese economy on a large scale?
    Politically speaking, the Wall Street bosses saw that the Kishi Nobusuke government was increasingly intensifying its implementation of a traitorous and pro-American policy, and that the United States would firmly tie Japan with the chain of a new US-Japan military alliance treaty. In the "new era of US-Japan relations" announced by Nobusuke Kishi and Eisenhower, the United States wants to further comprehensively control Japan politically, militarily, and economically, which is greatly conducive to the expansion of American monopoly capital into Japan.
    Economically speaking, in recent years, the strength of Japanese monopoly capital has developed rapidly, and profits are high, attracting American monopoly capital eager to intervene in Japan. According to statistics in September of this year, the profits of more than 300 Japanese companies increased by 41% compared with the same period last year. The net profit of the ten largest companies, such as "Hitachi Manufacturing Co.," increased by an average of 50%, and some increased by 141%. In the United States, due to excess production capacity, difficulty in sales, and low interest rates in the financial and securities markets, "excess capital" has no way out. Moreover, half of the capitalists in the American "investment group" who came to Japan for negotiations this time have investments in Japan or have "cooperative relations" with Japanese manufacturers, and they have a vital stake in the issue of investment in Japan.
    Another important reason in the economic field is that American inflation has led to an increase in production costs, which has weakened the competitiveness of American goods in the international market. American monopoly capital attempts to use Japan's cheap labor and industrial technology to reverse its unfavorable situation in the "international trade war." At the roundtable conference, the American side particularly emphasized the close relationship between "direct cooperation" between Japanese and American enterprises and the establishment of "joint ventures," which is related to such plans. Before this meeting, this kind of collusion between Japanese and American monopoly capital had actually begun. For example, Japan's "Furukawa Electric Industry" company signed a "capital cooperation contract" with American Alcoa Aluminum Company, jointly opening "Furukawa Alcoa Aluminum International Company." Some large American companies sign long-term purchase contracts with large Japanese companies, affixing American trademarks to Japanese goods and selling them on the international market. For example, American Hoover Company signed a fifteen-year long-term purchase contract with Japan's representative bearing manufacturing company "Nippon Seiko Co.," American Hoffman Professional Company also signed a similar contract with Japan's "Toyo Bearing Manufacturing Company," and American International General Electric Company signed a long-term purchase contract worth approximately 1 billion yen per year with Japan's "Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company." It is particularly noteworthy that the United States is using this method to make Japan's industrial technology capabilities serve its military economy of manufacturing missiles. For example, the United States attempts to use semiconductor radios ordered from large Japanese companies to meet civilian needs, while making American-produced semiconductors serve the development of the missile industry. In addition, the United States also plans to produce various parts of missiles in Japan. Japan's "Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company" and "Nippon Electric Company" have completed the trial production of the guidance device for the "Sidewinder" missile, which is a proof. This roundtable conference is that the United States wants to force Japan to affirm these accomplished facts, and through free securities investment and so-called "joint venture" forms in the future, to completely turn the Japanese economy into an appendage of American monopoly capital.
    This roundtable conference also discussed the so-called "Japan-U.S. economic cooperation" issue of "combining American capital and Japanese technology to develop Southeast Asia." Representatives from both Japan and the United States studied the conditions and possibilities for the two countries' monopoly capital to open "joint ventures" in Southeast Asia at the meeting. When reporting on this conference, Kyodo News emphasized that American monopoly capital's enthusiasm for "investment in Japan" and "development of Southeast Asia through Japan-U.S. cooperation" was beyond Japan's expectations. It is remembered that two years ago, Nobusuke Kishi peddled his "Southeast Asia Development Fund Plan" and begged for American aid, but the American government and the American financial industry generally expressed indifference. Now that American politicians are suddenly enthusiastic about the issue of Japan-U.S. "developing Southeast Asia," it certainly cannot be considered that the United States wants to help Japan realize Nobusuke Kishi's "Southeast Asia Development Fund Plan." The United States has its own plans. The United States and Japan are planning to revise the US-Japan "Security Treaty," not only to make Japan take the lead in aggression in the Far East for it, but also to make Japan its "Oriental factory," using Japan's cheap labor and industrial technology to pave the way for its economic expansion in Southeast Asia. Eisenhower said in April of this year that Japan's industrial strength is the "core of any collective effort" by the United States to carry out aggression and expansion in the Far East. Japan's "Economist" magazine once pointed out that whether Japan and the United States carry out "economic cooperation" in Southeast Asia or revise the "Security Treaty," they are based on the same line of the United States reorganizing and strengthening its global strategic system.
    American Secretary of Commerce Mueller, who came to Japan just after the roundtable conference closed, said in his speech that the United States is willing to provide sufficient funds for the "development" of Southeast Asia plan; on the other hand, it threatened Japan that in order to promote trade between the two countries, Japan must agree to the freedom of American capital to invest in Japan. The intention of the United States at the roundtable conference is very clear. The reason why it is willing to provide funds for the "development" of Southeast Asia is to exchange it for Japan's opening the door to American goods and capital.
    Once this plan of the American and Japanese reactionaries is realized, it will not only be a brutal trampling on Japan's national economy, but will also further deprive the Japanese people of their democratic rights and the right to live.
    Precisely because of this, this secret Japan-U.S. roundtable conference has aroused the vigilance of people from all walks of life in Japan. Even some people in the Japanese business community believe that this is a repeat of the atrocities in 1854 when the United States used warships and cannons to force Japan to sign unequal treaties.

### 日美垄断资本的圆桌会议

　　日美垄断资本的圆桌会议
　　万峰
    继美国在关税及贸易总协定东京会议上向日本发动了“贸易自由化”攻势之后，美国垄断资本的海外扩张组织“国际商业”集团又向日本发动了一个新的攻势，于11月下旬在东京召开了秘密的“国际商业日美圆桌会议”。日本报刊把这次会议叫做美国对日本发动的“投资自由化”攻势——美国垄断资本要求排除一切障碍、自由无阻地打进日本经济。
    今年春天以来，美国就不断要求日本为美国资本进一步渗入日本大开方便之门。今年5月2日，当时的日本通商产业相高碕达之助从美国访问回来后发表谈话说：“在美国喊出‘日本的资本市场必须向国外开放’的呼声之高出乎意料之外；他们甚至指责说，日本一方面要求美国在东南亚同它合作，一方面又严格限制美国向日本国内的投资，令人感到遗憾”。11月5日，美国商务部助理部长基恩斯在东京“美国俱乐部”的讲话中更露骨地表示：“日本应该更自由地输入美国私人资本。”据日本报纸透露，在这次圆桌会议上讨论得最多的，就是美国对日投资问题。美国垄断组织的代表同岸信介等当权人物以及日本各垄断组织的首脑人物进行了广泛地接触，对日本方面施加了巨大的压力，要日本取消限制外国投资的障碍。“朝日新闻”说，他们“猛烈地抨击日本关于限制外国投资和限制外国汇款的法律”。还有消息说，美国不仅要日本政府当局修改对外国投资有一定限制作用的“外资法”和“外汇管理法”，而且要根本修改“禁止垄断法”和制定禁止罢工法令。
    近年来，美国垄断资本日益控制着日本的国民经济。据今年12月15日“朝日新闻”引用的日本大藏省、通商产业省和日本银行的调查资料，从1949年到1959年10月止的十年内，外国垄断资本在日本的投资总额共有两千六百一十七亿日元，如按一比三百六十的外汇比价，折合美元是七亿二千七百万。其中绝大部分是美国资本。从1950年到1958年9月大约八年内，日本从世界银行、美国进出口银行及美国商业银行输入的美国资本总计达四亿五千万美元，如果加上其它方面的投资，目前估计在五亿美元以上。
    尽管美国资本在外国对日投资中占巨大的比重，但实际上美国私人资本的直接投资（包括股份、合办企业和设备投资等）并不多。这是因为战后日本人民争取独立、和平、民主的力量有较大的发展，日本人民坚决反对日本反动统治集团投靠美国的政策，使美国私人资本望而却步。再就是因为日本在1950年前后颁布的“外汇管理法”和“外资法”，对外国垄断资本的侵入起了一定限制作用。据联合国的统计材料，美国垄断企业在日本的直接投资不仅比在西德少，甚至也比在菲律宾少。美国在西德的私人直接投资到1957年就有四亿二千四百万美元，但是到1958年在日本却只有一亿八千二百万美元。据“朝日新闻”说，出席这次圆桌会议的美国垄断资本代表，曾露骨地表示要以“取得百分之百的股份的形式打进日本企业”，也就是说要以大规模的投资来全面地控制日本企业。那末，为什么美国垄断资本现在却急于大举渗入日本经济呢？
    从政治上说，华尔街老板看到岸信介政府日益变本加厉地执行卖国亲美政策，美国又将以新的日美军事同盟条约这条锁链牢牢地拴住日本；而在岸信介和艾森豪威尔宣布的“日美关系新时代”中，美国要从政治、军事和经济上进一步全面地对日本实行控制，这大大有利于美国垄断资本的对日扩张。
    从经济上说，近年来，日本垄断资本的实力发展迅速，利润优厚，吸引着美国垄断资本急于在日本插手。据今年9月间的统计，日本三百多家公司利润比去年同期增加了41％，“日立制作所”等十家最大的公司纯利平均增加50％，有的增加141％。而在美国国内，由于生产能力过剩，销售困难，加之金融、证券市场利息低，“过剩资本”没有出路。况且这次到日本谈判的美国“投资团”中，有一半资本家在日本有投资或者同日本的厂商有“合作关系”，他们在对日投资问题上有着切身的利害关系。
    在经济方面的另一个重要原因，是美国的通货膨胀引起生产成本增高，以致削弱了美货在国际市场上的竞争能力，美国垄断资本企图利用日本的低廉劳动力和工业技术力量来挽回它在“国际贸易战”中的不利形势。在圆桌会议上，美国方面特别强调日美企业之间“直接合作”和建立“合办企业”的紧密关系，就同这样的打算有关。在这次会议以前，日美垄断资本的这种勾结，实际上已经开始了。如日本“古河电气工业”公司同美国阿尔考铝业公司签订了“资本合作合同”，合资开办了“古河阿尔考铝业国际公司”。有些美国大公司同日本大公司签订长期购货合同，把日本商品贴上美国商标到国际市场上出售。例如，美国胡佛公司同日本有代表性的轴承制造公司“日本精工公司”签订了十五年的长期购货合同，美国霍夫曼专业公司同日本“东洋轴承制造公司”也签订了同样的合同，美国国际通用电气公司同日本“东京芝浦电气公司”签订了每年约值十亿日元的长期购货合同。尤其值得注意的是美国利用这种办法，使日本的工业技术能力为它的制造导弹的军事经济服务。比如，美国企图利用在日本大公司订制的半导体收音机来满足民用，而使美国生产的半导体为发展导弹工业服务。此外，美国还计划在日本生产导弹的各种部件，日本“东京芝浦电气公司”和“日本电气公司”已经完成了“响尾蛇式”导弹的诱导装置的试制工作，就是一个证明。这次圆桌会议，就是美国要迫使日本肯定这些既成事实，并且通过今后自由的证券投资和所谓“合办企业”形式，把日本经济彻底变成美国垄断资本的附庸。
    这次圆桌会议还讨论了“把美国资本和日本技术结合起来开发东南亚”的所谓“日美经济合作”问题。日美双方代表在会上研究了两国垄断资本在东南亚开设“合办企业”的条件和可能性。日本共同社在报道这次会议时强调说，美国垄断资本想要“对日投资”和“由日美合作来开发东南亚”的热情之高，出乎日本意料之外。人们记得，在两年以前，岸信介曾兜售过他的“东南亚开发基金计划”，并且乞求美国援助，可是美国政府和美国金融实业界普遍表示冷淡。现在美国政界人士忽然热衷于日美“开发东南亚”的问题，当然不能认为美国是要帮助日本实现岸信介的“东南亚开发基金计划”。美国是自有打算的。美国同日本策划修改日美“安全条约”，不仅要使日本替它在远东进行侵略时打头阵，而且要使日本成为它的“东洋的工厂”，利用日本的低廉劳力和工业技术能力替它在东南亚实行经济扩张开路。艾森豪威尔在今年4月间曾说，日本工业力量是美国在远东实行侵略和扩张的“任何集体努力的核心”。日本“经济学人”杂志曾指出，无论日美在东南亚展开“经济合作”或是修改“安全条约”，都是基于美国重新改组和加强其世界战略体制的同一条路线的。
    在圆桌会议刚刚闭幕后就到日本活动的美国商务部长米勒，在谈话中一面表示美国愿意为“开发”东南亚计划提供足够的基金；一面又要挟日本说，为了促进两国的贸易，日本必须同意美国资本对日本国内投资的自由。美国在圆桌会议上的意图是非常清楚的，它之所以愿意为“开发”东南亚提供资金，是为了换取日本对美国商品和资本开门。
    美日反动派的这个计划一旦实现，不仅是对日本民族经济的粗暴蹂躏，而且将进一步剥夺日本人民的民主权利和生活权利。
    正是因为这样，这次秘密的日美圆桌会议已经引起了日本各界人民的警觉。甚至日本实业界中有些人也认为这是1854年美国用军舰大炮强迫日本签订丧权辱国条约暴行的重演。
