　　This newspaper reports from Wuhan on December 1st: The industrial departments of Xiangyang Special District, Hubei Province, are using the experience accumulated over the past year in supporting agricultural production to help water conservancy construction sites reform tools. As of November 15th, the district has rushed to produce more than 4.6 million pieces of various water conservancy equipment and tools; and has universally established water conservancy tool reform groups and on-site factories, which has played a positive role in helping water conservancy construction sites improve work efficiency and save labor.

　　Over the past year, the industrial departments of Xiangyang Special District have accumulated rich experience in serving agricultural production. Starting early, preparing in advance, and rushing ahead of the farming season; implementing the combination of workers and farmers in tool reform, and combining factories and repair stations with the broad masses. This is their main experience. Over the past year, the industrial departments have launched several large-scale climaxes of rushing to produce farm tools in advance according to the seasonal requirements of agricultural production. This approach has not only met the needs of agricultural production in a timely manner, but also greatly improved product quality, reversing the phenomenon of rough quality and product backlog due to temporary rush tasks in some farm tool factories in the past. At present, many farm tool production departments have affirmed "three advances" (advance understanding, advance trial production, advance production) as a system.

　　While rushing to produce farm tools early, various places have also launched several climaxes of farm tool and tool reform according to the needs of each season. All localities have implemented the mass line method in tool reform, paying attention to close integration with the people's communes and members. For example, establishing a tool reform group combining leading personnel, technicians, and farmers, and systematically reforming what is needed according to the seasonal needs, so that agriculture raises the questions and industry answers them; summarizing and improving the innovative creations of the masses at any time, and organizing promotion quickly; adopting experimental appraisal methods, going deep into the fields, deep into the sites, studying and experimenting with farmers, conducting operation demonstrations, repeated appraisals, and improvements. Lishan Farm Tool Factory in Sui County established appraisal cooperation with the production team led by labor model He Shaohe nearby, and successively organized more than 30 mass appraisals of innovative products. One type of deep plowing plow, after 13 appraisals and multiple improvements, achieved stable plowing, deep plowing, high work efficiency, suitability for both dry and wet land, and convenient adjustment of depth, which commune members were very satisfied with.

　　The industrial departments of this district are now using the above-mentioned experience to support large-scale water conservancy construction projects. Xiangyang Special District plans to build more than 70,000 large, medium, and small reservoirs and renovate more than 26,000 reservoirs this winter and next spring. In order to speed up the construction of water conservancy projects, save labor, and reduce heavy physical labor, all reservoir construction sites are vigorously promoting tool reform and technical innovation, and carrying out high work efficiency campaigns. Many county and commune factories began to understand the needs of water conservancy projects from late September, formulated specific plans to support water conservancy construction, and started rushing to produce water conservancy tools. In mid-October, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of industrial secretaries of various counties and branch secretaries of county and commune farm tool factories to review the situation of supporting water conservancy construction from the bottom up based on needs, and further launched a climax of rushing to produce and reform water conservancy tools. In more than a month, more than 4.6 million pieces of various water conservancy equipment and water conservancy tools such as hoists, sluice gates, pound hammers, drill rods, shovels, and tampers have been produced, accounting for more than 90% of the planned production for this winter and next spring.

　　In supporting water conservancy construction, workers are taking tools, going deep into construction sites, and working with commune members to vigorously carry out water conservancy tool reform, carry out high work efficiency campaigns, and further implement the principle of "wherever there is a construction site, there is a factory." According to statistics from Sui County, Zaoyang and other ten counties, workers have gone deep into construction sites to set up 872 factories and tool reform factories, and more than 1,000 on-site mobile repair teams, creating many high-efficiency and labor-saving water conservancy tools. For example, a tool reform factory composed of more than 30 iron and wood workers at the Tangsan Reservoir construction site in Sui County successfully trial-produced ten kinds of tools such as automatic unloading vehicles and tampers, increasing work efficiency by five to six times. The Lishan People's Commune in this county, with the farm tool factory as the core, combined with the masses, and basically realized a series of reforms such as soil pushing, soil unloading, soil digging, and tamping on the water conservancy construction site within half a month. The workers of this commune's farm tool factory also worked with the commune members at the water conservancy construction site to make a rope-pulled soil-digging plow. Four people operate it, digging 200 cubic meters of soil per day, with an average of 50 cubic meters of soil per person, which is 15 times higher than the previous 3 cubic meters per day. The Baokang County Farm Machinery Factory has manufactured a wooden crane that can be used to repair dams, reservoirs, and lift goods. It can lift 1,500 to 2,500 catties at a time, requires only three people to operate, and can lift and unload once every fifteen minutes, lifting more than 72,000 catties per day. One wooden crane is equivalent to 56 laborers, increasing work efficiency by 78 times. The ox-drawn automatic soil dumping machine and ox-drawn tamping machine created by the Zhuangguan People's Commune have saved a lot of labor and greatly reduced physical labor.

    襄阳专区工业部门派人深入工地办工厂当参谋
    帮助水利工地大规模改革工具
    他们支援农业的主要经验是：赶在农时前面提前赶制农具，同农民结合进行工具改革
    本报武汉1日电　湖北省襄阳专区工业部门，运用一年来在支援农业生产中所积累的经验，帮助水利工地进行工具改革。到11月15日止，全区已赶制出各种水利设备和工具四百六十多万件；并在工地上普遍建立起水利工具改革小组、工地工厂，对于帮助水利工地提高工效、节省劳动力起到了积极的作用。
    一年来，襄阳专区工业部门在为农业生产服务方面所积累的经验是丰富的。及早动手，提前准备，赶在农时季节前面；在工具改革中贯彻工人与农民相结合，以工厂、修配站为中心与广大群众相结合。这是他们的一条主要经验。一年来，工业部门根据农业生产的季节要求，掀起了几次大规模提前赶制农具的高潮。这种做法，不仅及时满足了农业生产的需要，而且也大大提高了产品质量，扭转了一些农具厂以往因为临时赶任务，质量粗糙，以及季节已过产品积压的现象。目前，许多农具生产部门已把三提前
  （提前了解、提前试制、提前生产）作为一项制度肯定下来。
    在及早赶制农具的同时，各地还根据每个季节的需要，掀起了几次农具、工具改革的高潮。各地在工具改革中都贯彻了群众路线的方法，注意和人民公社、社员的密切结合。如建立领导人员、技术工人和农民三结合的工具改革小组，有计划地根据季节需要，用什么改革什么，作到农业出题目，工业做文章；随时总结提高群众的革新创造，迅速组织推广；采取实验鉴定的办法，深入田间，深入现场，与农民一起研究、试验，进行操作表演、反复鉴定、改进。随县历山农具厂与附近劳动模范何绍和领导的生产队建立鉴定合作，先后组织了三十多次群众性的对革新产品的鉴定，有一种深耕犁经过十三次鉴定和多次改进后，达到了犁地平稳、犁的深、工效高、水旱适用、调剂深浅方便等，社员非常满意。
    这个区的工业部门现在正在运用上述经验，支援规模浩大的水利建设工程。襄阳专区今冬明春准备新建大、中、小型水库共七万多处，整修水库二万六千多处，为了加快水利工程的建设、节约劳动力和减轻笨重的体力劳动，各水库工地都正在大闹工具改革和技术革新，开展高工效运动。许多县、社的有关工厂从9月下旬便开始了解水利工程的需要，制定支援水利建设的具体规划，并着手赶制水利工具。10月中旬，中共襄阳地委召开了各县工业书记、县、社农具厂支部书记会议，由一社一县自下而上根据需要检查了支援水利建设的情况，进一步掀起了赶制和改革水利工具的高潮。一个多月的时间，已生产启闭机、水闸门、磅锤、炮钎、铁锹、打夯机等各种水利设备和水利工具四百六十多万件，占今冬明春计划生产数的90％以上。
    在支援水利建设中，工人们带着工具、深入工地和社员们一起大搞水利工具改革，开展高工效运动，并进一步实行哪里有工地，哪里就有工厂。据随县、枣阳等十个县的统计，工人已深入工地办起了八百七十二座工厂和工具改革厂，一千多个工地巡回修理组，创造了许多工效高、节省劳动力的水利工具。如随县唐三水库工地一个由三十多名铁木工人组成的工具改革厂，试制成功自动卸土车、打夯器等十种工具，提高工效五至六倍。这个县的历山人民公社以农具厂为核心，与群众相结合，在半个月时间内，就基本上实现了水利工地推土、卸土、挖土、打夯等一系列的改革。这个公社农具厂工人还在水利工地和社员一起制成一种绳索牵引挖土犁，四个人操作，每天挖土二百方，每人平均挖土五十方，比以前日挖三方，提高工效十五倍。保康县农具机械厂制成一种可以用来修坝、修水库、起货物的木制起重机，一次能起重一千五百至二千五百斤，只需三个人操作，每十五分钟起卸一次，每天可起七万二千多斤。一台木制起重机顶五十六个劳动力，提高工效七十八倍。壮关人民公社创造的牛拉自动倒土机、牛拉打硪机，都节省了很多劳动力，而且大大减轻了体力劳动。
