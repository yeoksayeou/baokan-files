Xinhua News Agency report: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a meeting on December 8th and 9th. French Communist Party Political Bureau members Waldeck Rochet and Gustave Ansart delivered reports on the rural situation, the worker-peasant alliance and the tasks of the party, and on the struggle of the working class to win rights, respectively. The meeting passed relevant resolutions.

Rochet's report said that a large number of farmers voted for De Gaulle in the "referendum," but after suffering from personal autocracy, the attitude of the farmers has obviously changed.

Rochet listed some recent peasant demonstrations, saying that the demonstration in Finistère Province was attended by 30,000 people, the demonstration in Le Mans, Sarthe Province, was attended by 15,000 people, and the demonstrations in Nevers and Angoulême were attended by several thousand people. Rochet pointed out that De Gaulle's policies made the farmers "suddenly wake up."

After a detailed analysis of the party's agricultural policy and the tasks of the Communists in the countryside, he pointed out that "the fundamental interests of the peasants lie in uniting with the interests of the working class, both now and in the future."

Rochet said that the main political task of the party in the countryside is to forge an alliance between the broad masses of peasants and the workers in the struggle against capitalist monopolies, to win satisfaction of farmers' demands, to fight for peace and to restore democracy.

Ansart's report pointed out that the basic situation in France today is that the united masses have launched a powerful movement, determined to fight step by step to counter any damage the De Gaulle government inflicts on their living standards.

Ansart said that the policy implemented by De Gaulle after taking office was to solve all the problems caused by the war policy by attacking the working class and forcing the working class to bear all the consequences. In this situation, the workers have adopted the only attitude that is sufficient to make the De Gaulle regime and the capitalists who support this regime restrain themselves, that is, to unite and fight.

Ansart stated that the French Communist Party reiterates its support for and maintenance of the rights and demands of workers, first striving for universal increases in wages, pensions, and retirement benefits, and striving to grant agricultural workers, home workers, Algerian workers, and all immigrant workers and other wage earners the same rights.

Ansart said, "We believe that the basis of the alliance between the working class and the urban and rural middle classes is the struggle to defend common interests and oppose the policies of monopoly capital."

Ansart then talked about the lessons learned from the current struggle and exposed the destructive role played by the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party. He emphasized the need to achieve a united front in the struggle for rights, saying, "We are in a period when the struggle has begun to rise again, and the broad masses will definitely join this struggle. Our task is to do our best to make all the movements converge and embark on the road to fighting for renewed democracy."

The Central Committee meeting passed a resolution on the report made by Waldeck Rochet, pointing out that one of the blunt goals of De Gaulle's agricultural policy is to eliminate hundreds of thousands of small farmers in favor of capitalist agricultural enterprises. The laboring peasant masses are increasingly dissatisfied, and they are opposing the various consequences caused by the government's policies in various ways, especially by holding large-scale demonstrations.

The resolution said: "The current situation requires more than ever a joint struggle of workers and peasants to crush the attack of big capital, to strive for an end to the Algerian war, to strive for a policy of peaceful coexistence, disarmament, and the defense of national independence, to safeguard freedom, and to strive for the restoration and renewal of democracy."

The resolution said that it must be made clear to the laboring peasants that forming an alliance with the working class and taking the socialist road is the only path that can lead to the continuous growth of the welfare of agricultural laborers and the real progress of the countryside.

The resolution finally emphasized that: In order to strengthen activities among the peasant masses, the party's organizations in the countryside must strengthen propaganda and action, further attach importance to the work carried out among agricultural workers, and urge communist party members in the peasants to actively carry out activities in various movements.

The meeting also adopted the report made by Gustave Ansart, calling on all party organizations and all party members to strive to promote the unity of workers, to unswervingly lead them to adopt struggles to improve wages, retirement pensions and family allowances, to lead them to oppose rising living costs, and to oppose other consequences caused by the autocratic government pursuing the disastrous policies of monopoly capital groups.

　　法共中央全会通过决议
    加强工农联合斗争粉碎大资本进攻
    努力促进工人团结反对政府的反动政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：法国共产党中央委员会在12月8日和9日举行了会议。法国共产党政治局委员瓦德克·罗歇和法国共产党政治局委员居斯塔夫·安沙尔分别作了关于农村情况、工农联盟和党的任务、关于工人阶级争取权利的斗争问题的报告。会议通过了有关决议。
    罗歇的报告说，大批农民在“公民投票”时投戴高乐的票，但是在身受个人专权之害以后，农民的态度显然改变了。
    罗歇列举了最近农民的一些示威游行，他说，在菲尼斯太尔省的示威游行有三万人参加、萨尔特省的勒芒地方的示威游行有一万五千人参加、在讷韦尔和昂古列姆的示威游行有好几千人参加。罗歇指出，戴高乐的政策使农民“猛然醒悟”。
    他在详尽分析了党的农业政策和共产党人在农村中的任务之后指出，“农民的根本利益所在，是在目前和将来同工人阶级的利益结合起来。”
    罗歇说，农村中党的主要政治任务是，在反对资本主义垄断组织、争取满足农民要求、争取和平和恢复民主的斗争中，使广大的农民同工人结成联盟。
    安沙尔的报告指出，法国今天的基本形势是，团结起来的群众已经掀起一个强大的运动，决心一步一步地通过斗争来反击戴高乐政府对他们生活水平的任何损害。
    安沙尔说，戴高乐上台后执行的政策是以打击工人阶级、强使工人阶级承担一切后果的办法，来解决战争政策引起的所有的问题。在这样的形势下，工人采取了唯一足以使戴高乐政权和支持这个政权的资本家有所收敛的态度，即团结起来斗争。
    安沙尔表示，法国共产党重申支持和维护劳动者的权利要求，首先争取普遍增加工资、年金和退休金，争取给予农业工人、家庭劳动者、阿尔及利亚工人和一切移民劳动者和其他工资收入者同样的权利。
    安沙尔说，我们认为：工人阶级同城、乡中等阶级的联盟的基础，就是为保卫共同利益和反对垄断资本的政策而斗争。
    安沙尔接着谈到从当前的斗争中得出的教训，并且揭露社会党右翼领导人所起的破坏作用。他强调必须在争取权利的斗争中实现统一阵线，他说，我们正处在斗争又开始高涨的时期，广大的群众定将投入这个斗争。我们的任务是尽力使所有的运动殊途同归而走上争取革新民主的道路。
    中央委员会会议就瓦德克·罗歇所作的报告通过决议指出，戴高乐的农业政策的直言不讳的目的之一，就是要消灭以数十万计的小农，以利于资本主义的农业大企业。劳动农民群众日益不满，他们以各种方式，特别是举行声势浩大的示威游行，来反对政府的政策所造成的种种后果。
    决议说：当前的形势比以往任何时候更加需要工农联合斗争来粉碎大资本的进攻，争取结束阿尔及利亚战争，争取奉行和平共处、裁军和保卫民族独立的政策，维护自由，争取恢复和革新民主。
    决议说，必须向劳动农民明确指出，同工人阶级结成联盟，走社会主义的道路。只有这条道路才能导向农业劳动者的福利的不断增长、农村的真正进步。
    决议最后强调指出：为了加强在农民群众中的活动，党在农村中的各个组织必须加强宣传工作和行动，进一步重视在农业工人中间进行的工作，促使农民中的共产党员在各项运动中积极进行活动。
    会议还通过了居斯塔夫·安沙尔所作的报告，号召一切党组织和全体党员努力促进工人的团结，坚持不懈地领导他们采取提高工资待遇以及退休金和家属补助金的斗争，领导他们反对生活费用上涨、反对个人专权政府奉行垄断资本集团的祸国殃民政策所造成的其它后果。
