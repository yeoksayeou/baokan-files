Do you know the life of child actors?
　　Husheng

　　Children all like to watch performances by the China Children's Theater. One child wanted to befriend the actors of the Children's Theater. At a party, he found his favorite actor, but he was stunned upon meeting him. It turned out that the mischievous little boy on the stage was played by a female actor who looked to be twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, almost the same age as his mother.

　　In the Children's Theater, many female comrades play boys. Some are over twenty years old and still play toddlers in preschools. Everyone has experienced childhood, but it is not easy to authentically represent the image of children on stage after one or two decades. Especially child audiences, they are the most serious and love to "nitpick". If the performance is not realistic, they will shout loudly in the theater: "Fake! That's a woman playing him!" The actors of the Children's Theater must be able to act, sing, and dance, because these are necessary for fairy tales and myths. Children's plays include both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign stories, and actors must have knowledge of all aspects of life and history. It is even more troublesome if they have to play animals like rabbits, birds, and puppies in fairy tales. Actors must often go to the zoo, and sometimes even stand outside the iron cages for one or two hours, observing the expressions and changes of the small animals under conditions such as fright, hunger, satiety, etc., observing how large and small animals caress and help each other. In order to observe carefully, some actors even buy a rabbit or other animal to raise. All of this is to prepare materials for creating animal roles on stage. When rehearsing "Little White Rabbit", in order to allow the actors to experience the atmosphere of the forest, dozens of actors and band members from the Children's Theater took a bus to the forest in Xiangshan, more than thirty miles away from Beijing city, to rehearse the play.

　　Some people ask why the Children's Theater doesn't let children play the roles of children, but instead has adults play them. This is because: the play on stage is continuous and requires great energy and professional skills (unlike child actors in movies, where they are filmed in fragments, and the director can use various inducements to capture the required expressions, and can reshoot if it is not good). Children's plays include both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign stories, and actors must have extensive knowledge in order to create images of children of different personalities from different eras. Although young actors have some advantages in playing children, their knowledge and level of understanding are limited, and it is difficult for them to shoulder the burden of a professional actor. If that were the case, the actors in the Children's Theater would have to be replaced every four or five years, because young actors always grow up, which is not conducive to cultivating actors and improving the quality of children's plays. Many adults play children better than young actors.

　　If adults want to play children realistically, in addition to the actors being familiar with children's lives, understanding children's psychology, having a high degree of control over the tone and volume of their voices, and working hard on physical movements, they can also make up for it from aspects such as makeup, costumes, and the selection of roles. For example, in the selection of adult roles, if the actors playing the parents in the play are taller and fatter, the actors playing the children will appear relatively smaller. Also, if the stage is larger and the props such as tables and chairs in the play are enlarged, the actors can also appear relatively smaller. Some people think that children are simple, so it is easy to play children, unlike playing adults which is so complicated. This is a misunderstanding. Children's theater actors have their own unique and difficult creative process. It is difficult to be an excellent children's theater actor, but it is very honorable, because they shoulder the important responsibility of educating the successors of communism. (Attached picture)

    你知道儿童演员的生活吗？
    沪生
    孩子们都喜欢看中国儿童剧院的演出。有一个小朋友想和儿童剧院的演员交朋友，在一次联欢会上，他找到了自己所喜爱的演员，一见面他却怔住了；原来在舞台上那个调皮捣蛋的小男孩却是一个女演员扮演的，看来她已经有二十七、八岁，快跟自己的妈妈差不多大了。
    儿童剧院女同志演男孩子的可多哩，有的二十多岁了还演学龄前托儿所的娃娃。每个人都经历过童年生活，但是在一、二十年后要把儿童们的形象真实地表现在舞台上，那可不容易。尤其是儿童观众，他们最认真，也最爱“挑毛病”，演得要是有点不像，他们在剧场里就会大声嚷起来：“假的！那是女的演的！”儿童剧院的演员要会演、会唱、会舞，因为这些都是童话剧、神话剧中所必需的。儿童剧，古今中外的都有，演员必须有各方面的生活知识、历史知识。要是遇到在童话剧中演小兔、小鸟、小狗那些动物，就更麻烦了。演员们必须常到动物园去，有的时候，甚至要在铁笼子外面站一、两个小时，观察小动物在受惊、饥饿、饱食……等情况下的表情和变化，观察大、小动物是怎样互相抚爱、帮助等等。为了细心观察，有的演员甚至买一只兔子或别的动物回来养。这都是为在舞台上创造小动物角色准备素材。排“小白兔”的时候，为了使演员感受大森林的气氛，儿童剧院的演员和乐队好几十人乘车到离北京市区三十多里香山的树林里排戏。
    有人问儿童剧院演孩子的演员为什么不让孩子来担任，而要成人来演？这是因为：舞台上的戏是连续进行的，需要很大精力和业务能力，（这不像电影中的小演员，他们是片断拍摄的，导演可用各种诱导拍下所需要的表情，不好还可以重拍）。儿童剧中古今中外的都有，演员必须有多方面的知识，才能创造各个时代不同性格的少年儿童形象。虽然少年演员演孩子有些优越条件，但他们的知识和理解水平有限，要担负起一个职业演员的重担是很困难的。如果真是那样做的话，那儿童剧院的演员每隔四、五年就要换一批，因为少年演员总是要长大的，这对培养演员和提高儿童剧的演出质量都不利。很多成人演孩子比少年演员演孩子还要演得好。
    成人演孩子若要演得像，除了演员要熟习儿童生活，摸透儿童心理，对声音的音色和音量有高度控制能力，形体动作要下苦功练以外，从化装、服装、角色的挑选等方面也可以弥补，如成年角色的挑选，在剧中演父母的演员若高些、胖些，就可使演儿童的演员相对地显得小了；又如舞台大些，剧中的桌子、椅子等道具放大些，也可以使演员相对显小。有人以为小孩子单纯，所以演儿童很容易，不像演成人那样复杂，这可是个误解。儿童剧的演员，有他自己独特的艰苦创作过程。做一个优秀的儿童剧演员是困难的，但却非常光荣，因为他们身负着教育共产主义接班人的重责。（附图片）
