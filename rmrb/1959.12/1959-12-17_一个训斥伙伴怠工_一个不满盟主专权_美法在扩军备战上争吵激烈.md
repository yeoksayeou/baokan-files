Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 15th: On the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Ministerial Council meeting in Paris, a fierce dispute erupted once again between France and the United States because the United States adopted a rude attitude in blaming its allies, especially France, for insufficient arms expansion and war preparations.

This dispute originated from a speech made by U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Twining at a secret meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Military Committee on the 10th, and the deliberate leaking of this speech. According to Western newspapers, Twining, in his "very tough" speech, rebuked most NATO member states for failing to fulfill their "military obligations" to the alliance. These newspapers also said that Twining's accusations were "aimed directly at France, saying it was the culprit, and implicitly accused French President de Gaulle of being responsible." It is reported that Twining's speech caused sharp dissatisfaction on the French side, "like a diplomatic bomb." France was particularly dissatisfied that Twining's secret speech was leaked by the U.S. side specifically summoning several American reporters.

Following this incident, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Permanent Representative Council held an emergency meeting at the request of France to discuss this "leak."

Amidst this public quarrel, U.S. Secretary of State Herter, who arrived in Paris to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Ministerial Council meeting, held talks with French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville yesterday.

The talks between Herter and Couve de Murville did not bring the two sides closer. It was revealed that Herter expressed support for Twining's views. Herter reiterated Twining's statement that NATO countries should accept a reasonable share of the "common defense" burden. Herter also said that the differences between the United States and France on the issue of the unified command of the armies of the member states of the alliance under a central command were profound.

During the talks, Couve de Murville not only expressed great dissatisfaction with Twining's speech, saying that the disclosure of this speech "very surprised" the French government, but also complained that the United States abstained from voting on the Algerian issue in the United Nations General Assembly on the 12th. Couve de Murville believes that it is difficult to understand why the United States supports the de Gaulle plan and yet abstains from voting on the Algerian issue.

It is said that Herter told Couve de Murville that the United States did not vote against it because it did not want to "anger the emerging Asian and African countries." As everyone knows, the United States was criticized by Asian and African countries a few days ago for opposing the proposal of the twenty-two Asian and African countries on the Algerian issue in the Political Committee of the General Assembly.

French newspapers launched a fierce counterattack against Twining's speech. "Combat" said that the policy of "containment," which originally sought to prevent others from sharing secrets and monopolizing all actions under the leadership of the United States, which wields great power, "is now drawing criticism from all European allies."

### 一个训斥伙伴怠工　一个不满盟主专权  美法在扩军备战上争吵激烈

    一个训斥伙伴怠工　一个不满盟主专权
    美法在扩军备战上争吵激烈
    据新华社巴黎15日电　在北大西洋集团部长理事会在巴黎举行会议前夕，由于美国采取粗暴态度责怪它的盟国、特别是法国扩军备战不力，在法国和美国之间再一次发生了激烈争吵。
    这次争吵起因于美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁10日在北大西洋集团军事委员会上的秘密会议上的一次演说以及这次演说的被故意透露出来。据西方国家报纸报道，特文宁在他的这篇“十分强硬的”演说中训斥大多数北大西洋集团成员国没有履行它们对这个集团承担的“军事义务”。这些报纸还说，特文宁的指责的“矛头直接指向法国，说它是祸首，并且隐约地指责法国总统戴高乐是要负责的人”。据报道，特文宁的演说“像投出了一颗外交炸弹”一样引起了法国方面尖锐的不满。法国特别不满的是特文宁的秘密演说是由美国方面专门召见几个美国记者透露出去的。
    在这一事件发生以后，北大西洋集团常任代表理事会在法国的要求下举行了一次紧急会议来讨论这次“泄密”。
    在这种公开吵闹的情况下，到达巴黎准备参加北大西洋集团部长理事会会议的美国国务卿赫脱昨天同法国外交部长德姆维尔举行了会谈。
    赫脱和德姆维尔的会谈并没有使双方意见接近，据透露，赫脱表示支持特文宁的意见。赫脱再度强调了特文宁所谓北大西洋集团国家应接受“共同防务”负担中合理的份额。赫脱还说，美国和法国之间关于这个集团各成员国军队统一在一个中央司令部指挥下这个问题上的分歧是深刻的。
    德姆维尔在会谈中不仅对特文宁的演说表示大为不满，说这篇演说的泄露使法国政府“非常惊讶”，而且还埋怨美国12日在联合国大会表决关于阿尔及利亚问题的投票时弃权。德姆维尔认为，美国既然支持戴高乐计划而又在关于阿尔及利亚问题的投票中弃权，这很难理解。
    据说，赫脱告诉德姆维尔说，美国所以不投反对票是因为不愿“激怒新兴的亚非国家”。大家知道，美国前几天由于在联大政委会中反对亚非二十二国关于阿尔及利亚问题的提案，因而受到亚非国家的指责。
    法国报纸对特文宁的演说进行了猛烈的反击，“战斗报”说，原来想在美国大权独揽的领导下不让别人分享秘密并垄断一切行动来奉行“遏制”政策，“现在引起所有欧洲盟国的抨击。”
