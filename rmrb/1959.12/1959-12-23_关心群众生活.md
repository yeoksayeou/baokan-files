　　Caring for the Masses' Livelihood
    The Southern Daily published an editorial on December 18th titled "The Greater the Enthusiasm of the Masses, the More Important it is to Care for Their Livelihood." The following is a summary:

    Highly concerning ourselves with the masses' livelihood has always been one of the hallmarks of our Party sharing the same fate and breathing the same air as the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong, in his article "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," told us that all practical problems in the lives of the masses are problems we should pay attention to, and scientifically demonstrated the inseparable relationship between caring for the masses' livelihood and completing revolutionary tasks.

    At present, the masses' enthusiasm is indeed very high, the progress of various tasks is getting faster and faster, and the labor efficiency of the masses is getting higher and higher. Taking water conservancy construction as an example, at this time last year, the large-scale water conservancy teams had just entered the construction site, while now Guangdong Province has completed 350 million cubic meters of earthwork, which is equal to half of the planned task for this winter and next spring, and equal to the total earthwork completed from 1950 to 1957. The average daily work efficiency of each worker in the province has also increased from 1.9 cubic meters at the end of November to 3.7 cubic meters. Countless facts prove that this year's winter production campaign is coming more fiercely and more practically, and the mast for continued leaps forward next year is becoming increasingly clear. Precisely because of this, our cadres at all levels are prone to a kind of illusion, believing that caring for the masses' livelihood is merely a trivial daily matter, and therefore only focus on production in their work, and not on livelihood. There are even some comrades who have developed the erroneous view of opposing production and livelihood. Therefore, highlighting the issue of arranging livelihood is very necessary. At present, the people's communes in various places are arranging the masses' livelihood, including thoroughly implementing the grain distribution policy, running collective welfare undertakings well, and implementing a combination of work and rest in production, etc. If these tasks are not done well, it will be detrimental to handling the relationship between people according to socialist principles. Specifically, it will affect the relationship between leaders and the masses, between the collective and the individual, and between this part of the masses and that part of the masses. This kind of interpersonal relationship is an important component of production relations. If the people's communes and production brigades, as organizers of the masses' livelihood, do not handle the masses' livelihood problems well, it will affect the coordination of this relationship, and thus will be detrimental to the development of the masses' enthusiasm, detrimental to the development of productive forces, and detrimental to the consolidation of the people's communes. When the winter production movement is in full swing, the issue of arranging livelihood should be viewed from this principled height. The facts are also like this. Many people's communes and production brigades, by working through livelihood arrangements and correctly handling interpersonal relationships, have achieved extremely good results in current production. For example, some members of the Changkeng Reservoir construction site in Gaohe County initially planned to leave after a few days because they saw that the construction site had thatched huts, slept on straw, and didn't eat well. Later, the leaders of the construction site improved the eating and living conditions, reasonably arranged work and rest time, and carried out recreational activities on the construction site. They resolutely stated that they would not go home until the project was completed, and they doubled their work efficiency. From this, it can be seen that arranging the masses' livelihood well is an important measure to maximize the enthusiasm of all commune members, enabling them to maintain the most vigorous enthusiasm persistently, and therefore is also an important key to promoting the further development of the current production upsurge, and is by no means a "small matter" that can be managed or ignored.

    In order to arrange the masses' livelihood well, we must immediately strengthen the Party's leadership over this work. Party committees at all levels should, as Comrade Mao Zedong instructed in his article "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," discuss, decide, implement, and inspect all issues related to the masses' livelihood. In order to ensure that this work is done well, responsible cadres must be designated to lead this work full-time, form a battle line, and earnestly strengthen specific leadership. Party organizations at all levels must educate all cadres to make them deeply understand the principle that the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more important it is to care for their livelihood, so that everyone in the Party cares about the masses' livelihood, ensuring that every farmer in the province can live a good life, in order to promote the sustained development of the production upsurge.

### 关心群众生活

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

　　关心群众生活
    12月18日南方日报以“群众的干劲越大，越要关心群众生活”为题发表社论。摘要如下：
    高度关心群众生活，历来就是我们党同群众共命运同呼吸的标志之一。毛泽东同志在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中告诉我们，一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题，并且科学地论证了关心群众生活和完成革命任务的不可分割的关系。
    目前群众干劲确实很大，各项工作的进度越来越快，群众的劳动效率越来越高。拿兴修水利来说，去年这个时候，大办水利的队伍只是刚刚进入工地，而现在广东全省已经完成三亿五千万土方，等于今冬明春计划任务的一半，等于1950到1957年完成土方的总和；全省每个民工每天的平均工效，也已经从11月底的一点九方提高到三点七方。无数的事实在证明今年的冬季生产运动来得更猛更踏实，明年的继续跃进的桅杆是越来越看得清楚了。也正是由于这样，我们的各级干部就容易产生一种错觉，认为关心群众生活只不过是一种日常的琐细的事情，因而在工作中只抓生产，不抓生活；也还会有些同志产生了把生产和生活对立起来的错误观点。所以，把安排生活问题突出地提出来，是十分必要的。目前各地人民公社安排群众生活问题，包括把粮食分配方针贯彻到底问题、办好集体生活福利事业问题和生产中实行劳逸结合问题等等。如果这些工作做得不好，就不利于按照社会主义原则来处理人与人之间的关系，具体地说，会影响到领导和群众之间、集体与个人之间、这一部分群众与那一部分群众之间的关系。这种人与人的相互关系，是生产关系的重要组成部分。作为群众生活的组织者的人民公社和生产大队，如果对群众生活问题处理得不好，那就影响到这种相互关系的协调，因而就会不利于群众干劲的发挥，不利于生产力的发展，也不利于人民公社的巩固。在冬季生产运动气势磅礴的时候，安排生活问题是应当提到这一原则高度来看待的。事实也如此。许多人民公社和生产大队，由于通过生活安排工作，正确处理了人与人的关系，对当前生产起到了极为良好的效果。例如，高鹤县长坑水库工地的一些社员，最初看见工地住茅寮、睡禾草、吃不好，打算干几天就走；后来工地领导改善了吃和住的条件，合理安排了作息时间，开展了工地文娱活动，他们便坚决表示工程不完成决不回家，并且成倍地提高了工效。由此可见，安排好群众生活，是最大限度发挥全体公社社员的积极性，使他们持久不懈地保持最旺盛的干劲的重要措施，因而也就是推动当前生产高潮进一步发展的重要关键，绝不是可管可不管的“小事情”。
    为了安排好群众生活，必须立即加强党对这个工作的领导。各级党委要像毛泽东同志在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文所指示的那样，对于凡是有关群众生活的问题，就“应该讨论，应该决定，应该实行，应该检查”。为了保证做好这个工作，必须指定负责干部专职领导这个工作，组成一条战线，切实加强具体领导。各级党组织必须教育所有的干部，使他们深刻懂得群众干劲越大，就越要关心群众生活的道理，以便使全党人人关心群众生活，保证全省每一个农民都能把日子过得很好，以推动生产高潮持久地向前发展。
