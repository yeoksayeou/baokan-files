    Du Fengrui Visits Home
    Wu Shan'ao
    In the spring of 1957, Du Fengrui took advantage of his vacation to visit his hometown, Zhaowa Village in Fangcheng County, Henan Province, which he had been away from for ten years.

    Du Fengrui spent his miserable childhood here. He was born here in 1933. When he was only eight months old, his father carried him in a bamboo basket to flee the famine. The family was scattered. Du Fengrui's three-year-old sister was sold as a child bride, and Du Fengrui and his brother were also sold several times. At the age of ten, Du Fengrui went to work as a cattle herder for the landlord Wang Longxing, suffering enough of the landlord's beatings and insults. It was not until the liberation of his hometown in 1948 that he put down the whip, joined the People's Liberation Army, and embarked on the revolutionary road. Now, after being away from home for ten years, how much he wanted to see the changes in his hometown and see his aging parents!

    As soon as he entered the village, it was as if he had come to a strange place, and he couldn't even find his own door. All he saw was neat and tidy houses in the village. Where was the thatched shed where he had begged for food and worked as a hired hand! He wandered around the village before finally finding his home—four south-facing earthen houses.

    In the past ten years, the face of Zhaowa Village has been completely renewed. In the past, nineteen out of the dozens of families here had fled the famine and begged for food; now, every family has no worries about food or clothing. Seeing this, Du Fengrui jumped and hopped like a child with joy.

    For his first meal back home, his mother brought out a plate of white flour steamed buns and a bowl of scrambled eggs. Du Fengrui felt unspeakable joy in his heart. He thought, "Now is the time when the old crops are exhausted and the new crops are not yet ripe, and my family can still eat such food!" He reached out and took a piece of steamed bun, broke it open and looked at it, but then remained silent, with tears in his eyes. His mother asked him why he was like this. He said, "Mom, I remembered the suffering our family endured in the past, and I feel bad."

    During his ten-day vacation, in addition to visiting relatives and friends, Du Fengrui enthusiastically participated in the labor of the commune. At first, the cadres and villagers didn't let him go to the fields, but he refused to agree, saying, "The Party has given our army two tasks, one is to defend socialism, and the other is to build socialism. I feel so happy to be able to work with everyone when I come home."

    The young people in the village loved to chat with him whenever they had time. Everyone talked and laughed, asking Du Fengrui, "We heard that you are in the air force now and can fly planes. That's not simple!"

    "Yes," Du Fengrui replied, "In the old society, could a poor guy like us do such a thing? Only the Communist Party can lead our people to rule the country, and only the poor can fly planes!"

    "Does flying a plane require a lot of education?"

    Du Fengrui said, "Building socialism requires education in any profession. Take farming, for example, there is a lot to learn to make crops grow well. Like everyone else, I am a roughneck, but I have learned a little culture under the training of the revolutionary army. Our young people listen to the Party, and the future is great."

    Once, while Du Fengrui was happily chatting with everyone, Wang Longxing, the landlord under surveillance in the village, came. As soon as he entered the door, he greeted Du Fengrui obsequiously, "Oh, Cousin is back!"

    Du Fengrui gave him a cold look and said after a long while, "Cousin? Where did the cousin come from? I wasn't your cousin when I was a hired hand for you before; how did I become your cousin now? Sorry, I don't have that kind of luck!..."

    Everyone laughed heartily when they heard this. Wang Longxing was snubbed, and he chuckled falsely, slinking back.

    Du Fengrui said to everyone, "Brothers, be vigilant. The landlord has a knife hidden in his heart. He won't feel comfortable seeing our poor people's lives getting better and better, and he might retaliate against you at any time. We only allow those bad guys to be honest and not to talk or act recklessly."

    One day, the village held a mass meeting to arrange production tasks, and the commune cadres invited Du Fengrui to speak at the meeting. Du Fengrui first introduced the various aspects of life of the comrades in the army, and then talked about the benefits of cooperation. He said, "...More people, more power. The cooperative is stronger than the mutual aid group, and the large commune is stronger than the small commune. Following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao onto the bright road is definitely right! Our comrades in the army are all determined to defend our hometown and defend our motherland, and we will compete with the villagers in enthusiasm!"

    During this home visit, Du Fengrui encountered an unpleasant thing. His brother, Du Fengjia, made some mistakes in implementing the Party's policies, and the masses had bad reactions. Du Fengrui felt very sad when he heard this, and felt that dangerous forgetfulness of his roots had begun to grow in his brother.

    On this day, his older sister, who had been sold as a child bride since she was a child, came back to her mother's house to see her younger brother. Du Fengrui invited the whole family to sit together and held a family meeting. When his parents talked about the past when they were poorly clothed and underfed, their old tears streamed down their faces. Du Fengrui took the opportunity to say to Du Fengjia, "Brother, we can't forget the pain after the wound has healed. Now our family's life is really well-fed and well-clothed. Can't we work hard for the Party?"

    These words hit Du Fengjia's heart, and his face flushed.

    That night, the two brothers talked again under the lamp until the rooster crowed. Du Fengrui repeatedly persuaded Du Fengjia, "Brother, you are a demobilized soldier, you must take out the enthusiasm you had when you joined the army in the past and went south, and work hard for the Party. If you make a mistake, don't be discouraged, you must have the courage to correct it. From now on, when you say a word or do something, you must consider whether it is beneficial to the Party or beneficial to the enemy!..."

    Du Fengjia was very excited and said to Du Fengrui, "Brother, I thank you. I will never fail the Party's education and your hopes!"

    At this time, Du Fengrui took out three books, including "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," from his luggage and handed them to Du Fengjia, saying, "A person must study often, otherwise he will fall behind and make mistakes..."

    The peach orchard in front of Du Fengrui's house was planted by Fengrui himself during his home visit that year. He said to his brother at the time, "Brother, the peach trees bloom red every year, and the Party's kindness is endless. I want to plant the roots of happiness in the bitter land where our family used to build thatched sheds, so that we will never forget it for generations!"

    The peach trees are lush green, they are the embodiment of the martyrs; the full trees of red flowers that bloom in spring are the martyrs' loyalty to the Party. ...

    杜凤瑞探家
    吴善翱
    1957年春天，杜凤瑞趁休假的机会，探望了离别十年的故乡——河南方城县赵洼村。
    在这里，杜凤瑞曾经度过了他苦难的童年。1933年，杜凤瑞出生在这里。生下来八个月，就由老父亲用箩筐挑着出外逃荒去了。一家人五离四散。杜凤瑞三岁的姐姐被卖给人家做童养媳了，杜凤瑞和他的哥哥也几次被卖给别人。十岁的时候，杜凤瑞到地主王隆兴家去放牛，受够了地主的鞭打和辱骂。一直到1948年家乡解放了，他才放下了牛鞭，参加了人民解放军，走上了革命的道路。现在，在离家十年以后，他多么想看看家乡的变化，看看年老的爹娘啊！
    他一进村，就好像来到一个陌生的地方，竟找不到自己的家门了，只见村里家家房舍整齐，哪里还有他要饭、扛活时住过的那所茅草棚！他在村里转了一圈，才找到自己的家——一排向南的四间土平房。
    十年来，赵洼村的面貌已经焕然一新。过去这里的几十户人家，有十九户逃过荒，要过饭；而今家家不愁吃，不愁穿。杜凤瑞看到这些，高兴得像个孩子般地跳跳蹦蹦。
    回家后的第一顿饭，娘端出一盘白面馍和一碗炒鸡蛋。杜凤瑞心里真有说不出的高兴。他想：“现在正是青黄不接的时候，家里居然还吃得上这样的饭菜！”他顺手拿了块馍掰开看了看，却又一声不响，眼圈噙着泪花。娘问他为啥这样。他说：“娘呀，我想起了过去咱们家受的苦难，心里才不好受的。”
    杜凤瑞在十天的假期中，除了探望亲戚、朋友外，还热情地参加了社里的劳动。起初，干部和乡亲们都不让他下地，他哪里肯依，说：“党交给我们军队有两个任务，一个是保卫社会主义，一个是建设社会主义。我回家来能同大家一起劳动，心里可痛快啦。”
    村里的青年人一有空就爱去跟他聊天。大家谈谈笑笑，问杜凤瑞：“听说你现在是在空军，会开飞机，这可不简单啊？”
      “是啊，”杜凤瑞回答说：“要在旧社会，像咱们这样穷哥儿能干这号事？只有共产党领导咱人民坐江山，穷人才能开飞机呢！”
    “开飞机得有很高文化罢？”
    杜凤瑞说：“建设社会主义干哪一行都得有文化。拿种庄稼来说，要让庄稼长得好，学问可不少。我跟大家一样，是个大老粗，在革命部队的培养下，学习了一点文化。咱们青年人听党的话，前途是很大的。”
    有一次，杜凤瑞和大家谈得正高兴，村里的那个被管制的地主王隆兴来了，一进门就谄媚地向杜凤瑞打招呼：“唷嗬，表叔回来了！”
    杜凤瑞冷冷地看了一眼，半天才说：“表叔？哪来的表叔？从前我给你扛长工时不是你表叔；现在怎么变成是你的表叔啦？对不住，我没有那分福气！……”
    大家听了都哈哈乐开了。王隆兴碰了一鼻子灰，就嘿嘿假笑着，贼溜溜地回去了。
    杜凤瑞对大家说：“哥儿们要警惕，地主怀里揣把刀，他看到咱们穷人日子越过越好，心里不会舒服的，说不上啥时候就报复你一下。咱们对那些坏蛋，只许他们老老实实，不许他们乱说乱动。”
    一天，村里召开群众大会，布置生产任务，社里的干部请杜凤瑞在会上讲话。杜凤瑞先给大家介绍了部队同志各方面的生活，接着又谈到合作化的好处，他说：“……人多力量大嘛。合作社比互助组强，大社又比小社强，跟着共产党、毛主席走上阳关道，准不会错的！我们部队同志个个决心保卫家乡、保卫祖国，要同老乡们比比干劲呢！”
    杜凤瑞在这次探家中，遇到了一件不愉快的事情。他哥哥杜凤甲，在执行党的政策上犯了些错误，群众有不好的反映。杜凤瑞听到后，心里很难受，觉得在哥哥的身上已经开始滋长了危险的忘本思想。
    这一天，从小就卖给人家去当童养媳的姐姐，回娘家看弟弟来了。杜凤瑞就请全家老小坐在一起，开了个家庭会议。爹娘说起过去衣不蔽体、食不果腹的生活时，老泪纵横。杜凤瑞乘机对杜凤甲说：“哥呀，咱们不能好了疮疤忘了痛，现在咱家的生活真是丰衣足食了，还能不好好地为党工作？”
    这话说在杜凤甲的心里了，他脸上阵阵发烧。
    当天夜里，兄弟俩又在灯下谈开了，一直谈到鸡叫。杜凤瑞再三劝说杜凤甲：“哥呀，你是个复员军人，要把你过去参加部队南下进军时的干劲拿出来，好好为党工作。犯了错误，不要灰心，要有勇气去改正。以后你每说一句话、每做一件事的时候，都要考虑到对党有利，还是对敌人有利！……”。
    杜凤甲心里很激动，对杜凤瑞说：“弟呀，我感谢你。绝不辜负党的教育和你的希望！”
    这时，杜凤瑞从自己的行李包里拿出了“论共产党员的修养”等三本书，交给杜凤甲说：“一个人要常常学习，不学习就会落后，就会犯错误……”
    杜凤瑞家门前的一片桃树林，是凤瑞那年探家时亲手栽的。他当时对哥哥说：“哥呀，桃树开花年年红，党的恩情说不完。我要把幸福的根，栽在咱家过去搭茅草棚的苦地上，世世代代不忘记！”
    桃树一片油绿，它是烈士的化身；春天开出的满树红花，是烈士对党的一片忠诚。……
