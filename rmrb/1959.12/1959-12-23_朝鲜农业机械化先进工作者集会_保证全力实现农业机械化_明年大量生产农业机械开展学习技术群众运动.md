Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang Electric Dispatch—The North Korean National Conference of Advanced Workers in Agricultural Mechanization was held in Pyongyang from the 17th to the 19th. The conference discussed measures for achieving agricultural mechanization and adopted a resolution guaranteeing all-out efforts to complete the task of agricultural mechanization in northern Korea.

This conference was convened at the direct initiative of Prime Minister Kim Il-sung. More than 1,400 advanced workers in agricultural mechanization participated.

At the beginning of the conference, Park Jung-ae, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, read out the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Labor Party to the conference amidst warm applause. The congratulatory letter emphasized the possibility of agricultural mechanization and pointed out the fighting task of basically realizing agricultural mechanization in the plains areas such as Hwanghae South Province and South Pyongan Province within one or two years, and gradually basically realizing agricultural mechanization in other provinces within three or four years.

The congratulatory letter pointed out that under the current conditions, the realization of agricultural mechanization is an objective requirement for national economic development.

The congratulatory letter said that the party's agricultural policy is to complete agricultural cooperativization under the party's guidance, realize comprehensive water conservancy in rural areas, and make agricultural production leap forward.

The congratulatory letter finally called for launching a technical learning movement nationwide to accelerate the technical revolution.

Minister of Agriculture Kim Man-geum then delivered a report on accelerating agricultural mechanization at the meeting. The report pointed out that North Korea already possesses the material conditions for realizing agricultural mechanization. There are already mechanized base points and a technical foundation in the countryside. At present, there are eighty agricultural machinery rental stations in northern Korea, owning approximately seven thousand tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower), and more than nine thousand drivers and repair workers. Another important condition is that 88% of the ri (townships) in rural northern Korea already have electricity.

Kim Man-geum said that the steps for agricultural mechanization in North Korea are to first complete the agricultural mechanization of South Pyongan Province and Hwanghae South Province in the plains areas in 1960. State-run and provincial-run farms will also fully complete mechanization in 1960 and 1961. Kaesong City, North Hwanghae Province, North Pyongan Province, and South Hamgyong Province will basically complete agricultural mechanization within two or three years, and North Hamgyong Province, Chagang Province, and Ryanggang Province will also basically complete it within three or four years.

The report said that to this end, all machinery manufacturing factories must be mobilized next year to produce agricultural machinery and give priority to supplying the necessary steel, wood, and other materials. The industrial sector will mass-produce and supply tractors and other agricultural machinery.

The resolution adopted by the conference emphasized that all agricultural machinery rental stations must further play their role and be able to take responsibility for completing 80% to 85% of the main farm work in the near future, while leading and helping agricultural cooperatives in rental work. The resolution called on agricultural machinery manufacturing workers to produce four thousand tractors, three thousand trucks, thirty thousand sets of various agricultural implements for traction, and various other power and animal-powered machinery in 1960. The resolution emphasized the necessity of inventing new agricultural machinery suitable for North Korean conditions. The resolution also called on agricultural cooperatives to widely combine the use of modern agricultural machinery and small and medium-sized agricultural machinery to implement agricultural mechanization. The resolution emphasized that it is necessary to launch a mass technical learning movement to accelerate the national technical revolution.

After the meeting, Prime Minister Kim Il-sung awarded medals to 117 advanced workers and prizes to 36 advanced workers.

　　朝鲜农业机械化先进工作者集会
    保证全力实现农业机械化
    明年大量生产农业机械开展学习技术群众运动
    据新华社平壤电　朝鲜全国农业机械化先进工作者大会17日至19日在平壤举行，大会讨论了实现农业机械化的措施并通过决议，保证全力以赴，完成朝鲜北部农业机械化的任务。
    这次大会是在金日成首相直接倡议下召开的，参加大会的有一千四百多名农业机械化方面的先进工作者。
    大会开始时，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱在热烈的掌声中宣读了劳动党中央委员会给大会的贺信。贺信着重指出农业机械化的可能性，并指出了黄海南道和平安南道等平原地区在一两年内基本实现农业机械化、其他各道在三四年内逐步基本实现农业机械化的战斗任务。
    贺信指出，在目前的条件下，实现农业机械化是国家经济发展的客观要求。
    贺信说，党的农业政策是在党的指导下完成农业合作化，实现农村地区的全面水利化，并且使农业生产飞跃发展。
    贺信最后号召在全国范围内发动一个学习技术的运动以便加速技术革命。
    内阁农业相金万金接着在会上作了关于加速农业机械化的报告。报告指出，朝鲜已经具备实现农业机械化的物质条件。在农村中已经有了机械化的基点和技术基础。现在朝鲜北部有八十个农业机械代耕站，拥有约七千台（按十五马力算）拖拉机，有九千多名驾驶员和修理工人。另外一个重要条件是朝鲜北部农村中88％的里（即乡）已经有了电。
    金万金说，朝鲜农业机械化的步骤是首先在1960年完成平原地区的平安南道和黄海南道的农业机械化。国营和道营农场也将在1960年和1961年全面完成机械化。开城市、黄海北道、平原北道和咸镜南道将在两三年内基本完成农业机械化，咸镜北道、慈江道和两江道也要在三、四年内基本完成。
    报告说，为此，明年要动员一切机械制造工厂生产农业机械，并优先供应所需要的钢铁、木材等材料，工业部门将大量生产和供应拖拉机和其他农业机器。
    大会通过的决议着重指出，所有农业机械代耕站必须进一步发挥它们的作用，并且在最近的将来能负责完成80％到85％的主要农活，同时在代耕工作中领导和帮助农业社。决议号召农业机器制造工人在1960年生产出四千台拖拉机、三千辆卡车、三万部供牵引用的各种农业机具以及其他各种动力和畜力机械。决议强调指出了发明适合朝鲜条件的新式农业机器的必要性。决议还号召各农业社广泛地结合使用现代化农业机械和中小型农业机械来实行农业机械化。决议着重指出，有必要开展一个学习技术的群众运动来加速国家技术革命。
    会后，金日成首相授予一百十七位先进工作者奖章，授予三十六位先进工作者奖品。
