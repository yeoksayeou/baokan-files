　　An Epic of People's Struggle
    ——Introducing Dimov's "Tobacco"
　　Jia Xiang
    "Tobacco" is the best novel by the outstanding modern Bulgarian writer Dimitar Dimov, and also the most outstanding prose work in modern Bulgarian literature. In this epic work, with his outstanding ability to artistically generalize and his skill in analyzing the psychology of characters, the author vividly depicts a broad panorama of life in Bulgaria during the fifteen years before liberation.
    Dimitar Dimov is one of the most outstanding novelists in modern Bulgaria. He was born in Lovech, Bulgaria, in 1909. He studied medicine and is still a professor of animal anatomy at the Dimitrov Agricultural University, but he has a great love for literature. He is known for his psychological descriptions and began writing in the late 1930s, publishing two novels, "Lieutenant Bentz" (1938) and "The Guilty Ones" (1945); "Tobacco" is his third novel. Due to the success of this novel, Dimov was awarded the first prize of the Dimitrov Prize, the highest national prize in Bulgaria, in 1952.
  Southern Bulgaria is rich in tobacco production. Before liberation, many workers and peasants depended on tobacco for their livelihoods. They used their blood and sweat to cultivate the tobacco industry and also fattened a small group of tobacco capitalists. The novel reflects the life during the historical period of Bulgaria's liberation from 1929 to 1944. This was a period of intense turmoil in the world situation, and also a turning point in Bulgarian history—the invasion of economic crises; the intensification of domestic class struggle; the vigorous development of the national liberation movement, etc. It is against this historical background that the author vividly exposes the moral decay and corrupt life of Bulgarian tobacco capitalists, while enthusiastically praising the heroic struggle of the Bulgarian proletariat for a free and happy life.
    The main characters in the novel, Boris, Irina, and Kostov, are representatives of the bourgeoisie. They come from different backgrounds and have different personalities, but they are all permeated with the toxins of capitalist society. Boris climbed from a commoner to the position of a capitalist. He pursued money and power, ruthlessly exploited workers, annexed other tobacco companies, and established relationships with international monopoly capitalists, thus becoming a tobacco tycoon, controlling Bulgaria's internal and foreign affairs. He knew the terribleness of the people's power, so he was even more insidious and ruthless in suppressing strikes. He was greedy for money all his life, and finally died for the sake of money. Irina was originally a simple common girl who wanted to live a peaceful life through her own labor, but she also envied the "elegant" life of the "upper class," which is the root of her character's tragedy. After she entered bourgeois society with Boris, she chose the idle, extravagant, and licentious lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, sinking deeper and deeper, and finally committed suicide. Kostov came from the bourgeoisie. He only knew how to squander, gamble, enjoy himself, and play with women all his life. He lived a corrupt life, but he also wanted to pretend to be noble, help Boris exploit workers, and also pretend to be a philanthropist. In the end, he felt depressed and tired of everything, and finally ended his dirty life with suicide. This is a variant of the "superfluous man" produced when capitalist society develops to the final stage.
    Thoroughly exposing the ugliness of the bourgeoisie from a spiritual and moral point of view is an important feature of the novel. In exposing these characters, the author outlines a group portrait of various types of bourgeois characters, showing the author's high skill in digging into the inner world of various bourgeois characters.
    On the other hand, the author also depicts the life of the Bulgarian people and the struggle of the proletariat in the 1930s and the first half of the 1940s with revolutionary passion. Through mass scenes—the tobacco workers' general strike in the first part and the guerrilla warfare in the second part—the author focuses on depicting the noble qualities of the working class and their heroism and unity. Here, the author demonstrates his talent for portraying the collective image of the people.
    The most essential things in a person's character can be expressed in severe moments. It is precisely through such moments that the author shows the fighting character of Simeon, Spasuna, etc. in the strike, and the fighting character of Hristo, Micikin, etc. in the guerrilla warfare.
    Tobacco workers Simeon and Spasuna are Communists. They were responsible for leading the work during the general strike. Long-term struggle and hard life made them deeply realize that only by uniting and carrying out an uncompromising struggle against the bourgeoisie can they achieve a happy future. The struggle they faced was cruel, but for the sake of the communist ideal, they resolutely threw themselves into the battle. Their images are sublime and moving. The political commissar of the guerrillas, Hristo, was one of the earliest generations of Communists in Bulgaria. He participated in the anti-fascist armed uprising in September 1923. Long-term revolutionary activities have trained him into an outstanding proletarian fighter. In the last battle with the Germans, he voluntarily stayed behind to cover the retreat of the guerrillas and dedicated his life. This is a glorious image. The several characters that the author focuses on depicting are outstanding sons and daughters of Bulgaria. They irrigated the flowers of Bulgaria's freedom and liberation with their blood. Although they sacrificed themselves, they will always live in the hearts of millions of people in Bulgaria. In this novel, the author has erected immortal statues for them.

　　人民斗争的史诗
    ——介绍狄莫夫的“烟草”
　　家骧
    “烟草”是保加利亚现代优秀作家季·狄莫夫的最好的长篇小说，也是保加利亚现代文学中最出色的散文作品。作者在这部史诗式的著作里，以其卓越的艺术概括能力和善于分析人物心理的技巧，生动地描绘出保加利亚解放前十五年间广阔的生活画面。
    季·狄莫夫是保加利亚现代最优秀的长篇小说作家之一，1909年生在保加利亚洛维奇城。他是学医的，现在仍担任季米特洛夫农业大学家畜解剖学教授，但他十分爱好文学，以擅长心理描写知名，三十年代末开始写作，发表过“班茨中尉”（1938年）和“有罪的人”（1945年）两部长篇；“烟草”是他的第三部长篇小说。由于这本小说的成功，狄莫夫获得了1952年保加利亚国家最高奖金——季米特洛夫奖金一等奖。
  保加利亚南部盛产烟草，解放前许多工农靠烟草为生，他们用自己的血汗培育了烟草业，也养肥了一小撮烟草资本家。小说反映了1929至1944年保加利亚解放这段历史时期的生活。这是世界局势激烈动荡的时期，也是保加利亚的历史转折时期——经济危机的侵袭；国内阶级斗争尖锐化；民族解放运动蓬勃展开等。作者正是在这个历史背景上，淋漓尽致地揭露了保加利亚烟草资本家的道德堕落，生活腐化，同时满怀热情地歌颂了保加利亚无产阶级为争取自由幸福生活而进行的英勇的斗争。
    小说里的主要人物保利斯、伊利娜和科斯托夫等是资产阶级的代表。他们出身不同，性格各异，但都浸透了资本主义社会的毒素。保利斯从平民爬上了资本家的地位，他追求金钱权势，残酷剥削工人，吞并其他烟草公司，同国际独占资本家拉上关系，从而成了烟草大王，控制着保加利亚的内政外交。他深知人民力量的可怕，因而在镇压罢工时，手段更是阴险而毒辣。他一生贪求金钱，最后还是为贪求金钱而死。伊利娜原是一个朴素的平民姑娘，想靠自己的平静的劳动度日，但又羡慕“上流”社会的“高雅”生活，这是她的性格悲剧的根源。她随着保利斯进入资产阶级社会后，选择了资产阶级游手好闲、骄奢淫佚的生活道路，愈陷愈深，终于自杀了。科斯托夫出身于资产阶级，一生只知挥霍、豪赌、享乐和玩女人，平常生活腐化，还想自命清高，帮助保利斯剥削工人，还要装出一副慈善家的面孔。到头来觉得生活苦闷，厌倦一切，最后还是以自戕结束了肮脏的生命。这是资本主义社会发展到最后阶段时所产生的“多余的人”的一个变种。
    从精神、道德方面彻底揭露资产阶级的丑恶，是小说的一个重要特点。在揭露这些人物时，作者勾勒出各种类型的资产阶级人物的群像，显示出作者善于挖掘各种资产阶级人物内心世界的高度技巧。
    另一方面，作者也满怀革命激情地描写了本世纪三十年代和四十年代前半期保加利亚人民的生活和无产阶级的斗争。作者通过群众性的场面——第一部里烟草工人大罢工和第二部里的游击战争，集中地描绘了工人阶级的崇高品质和他们的英勇和团结。在这里，作者显示出他刻划人民集体形象的才能。
    在严峻的时刻最能表现人的性格中最本质的东西。作者正是通过这样的时刻，展现了在罢工中的西棉思、斯巴苏娜等的斗争性格，展现了在游击战争中的希什科、米奇金等的斗争性格。
    烟草工人西棉思、斯巴苏娜是共产党员，大罢工时担任领导工作，长期的斗争和困苦的生活使他们深刻认识只有团结一致同资产阶级进行不妥协的斗争，才能取得幸福的未来。他们面临的斗争是残酷的，但为了共产主义理想，他们毅然投入了战斗。他们的形象是崇高而动人的。游击队的政委希什科是保加利亚最早一代的共产党员，参加过1923年9月反法西斯武装起义，长期的革命活动把他锻炼成无产阶级优秀的战士，在同德国人最后一战时，他自愿留下掩护游击队撤退而献出自己的生命。这是一个光辉的形象。作者着力描绘的这几个人物是保加利亚的优秀的儿女，他们用鲜血灌溉了保加利亚自由解放的花朵。他们虽然牺牲了，但他们将永远活在保加利亚千千万万人民的心里。在这部小说里，作者为他们树立了不朽的雕像。
