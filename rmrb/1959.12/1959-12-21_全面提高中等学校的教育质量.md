Comprehensively Improve the Quality of Education in Secondary Schools

Secondary education is an important link in China's entire education undertaking. The comprehensive improvement of the teaching quality of secondary schools is extremely beneficial to the development of the entire education undertaking. Secondary schools lay a solid foundation for the all-round development of middle school students. When they enter universities, they can better engage in political and professional studies, thereby cultivating talents who are both red and expert needed for socialist construction. The level of secondary school education quality and the students' academic performance are by no means solely the concern of the schools themselves and individual students, but are major issues related to how to better serve proletarian politics and socialist construction. Therefore, further improving the quality of secondary school education has great political significance.

Under the correct guidance of the Party's education policy, the teaching quality of secondary schools has improved significantly. We should conscientiously summarize and promote the rich experiences created by secondary schools since the Great Leap Forward, oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, and further improve the quality of secondary school education on this basis. The experience of the leaping development of secondary education in Fujian Province under the leadership of the Party, published in today's newspaper, is worthy of attention. This is one of the examples of secondary education implementing the Party's general line and education policy.

To improve the quality of education, the most fundamental factor is to strengthen the Party's leadership over schools and adhere to putting politics in command. The socialist education undertaking is an important component of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and a powerful tool for the proletariat to transform the old society and build a new society. Therefore, the socialist education undertaking must be led by the Party. Many secondary schools have also gained important experience in this regard. That is, the Party's leadership over schools not only manages political and ideological work and production labor, but also manages teaching and professional work. The Party's leadership of teaching and professional work primarily and mainly puts politics in command, grasping the ideological and political direction of teaching, so that teaching work can be carried out in accordance with the Party's education policy. Leading cadres of secondary schools in Jiangsu Province personally teach classes, exploring experience from teaching practice to lead teaching. The Fujian Provincial Party Committee tightly grasped the Party's leadership over secondary schools, clarified the political direction, fully mobilized the enthusiasm of teachers and students, and adopted various measures to improve teaching quality, rapidly changing the face of secondary schools in the province. This shows that only by strengthening the Party's leadership can teaching work be done well. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership, it is also necessary to equip the Party's backbone from the organizational perspective, establish and improve Party organizations, and change the situation where Party organizations in some middle schools are relatively weak. At the same time, the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations in middle schools have played a significant role in promoting youth learning. Party organizations should continue to strengthen their leadership over them, treating them as powerful assistants.

Unswervingly implementing the Party's education policy is the fundamental guarantee for comprehensively improving teaching quality. Some people believe that implementing the education policy will reduce quality, and that politics and professional work, teaching and labor are opposed to each other. This is incorrect. Combining education with productive labor is a profound revolution, and is a struggle between two lines in education. Under the leadership of Party organizations, secondary schools in various regions have criticized all kinds of bourgeois educational ideas, and organized the vast number of teachers and students to conscientiously study the Party's education policies, improving the political consciousness and ideological level of teachers and students. Any shortcomings were promptly corrected, thereby creating a vigorous and united political situation in the schools, and establishing a brand-new socialist educational order. Teaching work, ideological and political work, and production labor must all be arranged in a coordinated manner under the overall policy. For young people who are still young, they should engage in labor within their capabilities, and can combine this with scientific and technological activities in secondary schools. Some people believe that middle school students engaging in labor within their capabilities means that labor can be ignored, which is obviously wrong. The Party's education policy is the fundamental policy of China's socialist education undertaking. Regardless of the type or level of school, it is necessary to unswervingly implement the Party's education policy according to its characteristics.

Secondary education is basic education. Major subjects such as Chinese, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and foreign languages should be grasped tightly. However, it is also necessary to care about the development of students' moral and physical education. Our school education is to cultivate the new generation into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. We must strengthen the communist ideology, style, and collectivist spirit of young people, and also enhance their physical fitness. These are all closely related to production labor. After middle school students participated in production labor, their thinking underwent profound changes, regarding physical labor as a pleasure, and their conduct and moral character greatly improved. In the past year, Zhao'an No. 1 Middle School in Fujian Province saw 720 model figures emerge in labor, study, and other aspects. Jinjiang No. 3 Middle School, standing on the front line of coastal defense, actively supported the front line in the battle to crush the provocations of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek group in the Taiwan Strait last year, braving enemy fire. It was awarded the honorary title of "National Socialist Advanced Collective" by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and was rated as a third-class collective merit by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front. Students in Anhui Province compared the changes before and after participating in production labor to "medicine jars" turning into "iron bullets." Participating in production labor can expand and improve students' knowledge level, enabling them to not only have book knowledge, but also have perceptual knowledge, learning production skills in industry, agriculture, and other fields. They can engage in both mental and physical labor. Doing so will not only not reduce but greatly improve the quality of education. Judging only from students' exam scores, the percentage of students in Fujian Province who passed the college entrance examination this year reached 62.8%, while in 1954, the percentage of students who passed the college entrance examination was only 5.6%; Anhui Province also leaped from a relatively backward situation to one of the better provinces in the country; and the quality of secondary education in Jiangsu Province has also greatly improved. These achievements are the result of resolutely implementing the Party's education policy and comprehensively improving the quality of education.

The improvement of the political and ideological and professional level of the teaching staff plays a direct role in improving the quality of education. School leaders must put politics in command, diligently study professional work, apply the Party's mass line to practical work, correctly implement the Party's policy on intellectuals, care for teachers politically, in their work, and in their lives, and inspire and encourage their enthusiasm. Teachers must constantly improve their political and ideological level, transform their thinking, and establish a class perspective, a mass perspective, a collectivist perspective, a labor perspective, and a dialectical materialist perspective. In addition, they must constantly improve their cultural level and professional ability. In the process of comprehensively improving the quality of secondary education, the Party organizations in Fujian and Anhui tightly grasped the political and ideological work of teachers, while at the same time not relaxing the improvement of teachers' professional level and the quality of teachers, achieving great results. Liaoyang No. 1 High School grasped many teaching links such as teacher preparation, lecturing, and tutoring, and reformed teaching methods based on the principle of theory linking with practice, improving teaching level. Renhuai No. 1 Middle School in Guizhou Province adopted the method of linking new and old teachers, learning while teaching, and carrying out teaching research, improving the teaching ability of new teachers. These are all good experiences. In the work of middle school teachers, the work of class teachers occupies an important position and must be strengthened. All teachers should be role models for young people not only in politics and professional work, but also in daily life.

The experience of Fujian and other places proves that the quality of secondary school education can be rapidly improved. A large number of schools that originally had poor foundations and conditions have now caught up with advanced schools. What are the reasons why they can catch up with advanced schools? An important one is to constantly overcome right-leaning thinking, fully exert people's subjective initiative, and use full revolutionary enthusiasm to bravely overcome difficulties and turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions. Many teachers in Beijing No. 43 Middle School originally believed that the school was small in scale and lacked equipment, and there was no way to run it well. The school's Party organization broke the "theory of conditions" and overcame the fear of difficulties, repeatedly educating teachers on how to correctly treat objective difficulties, and constantly summarized work and encouraged morale. As a result, the teaching quality significantly improved, surpassing many schools with fairly good foundations. This fact illustrates the truth that "everything depends on human effort." People say it well, everything is afraid of being taken seriously, as long as you take it seriously, you can do things well. In teaching, as long as teachers rack their brains and try their best to teach and guide, and students can study diligently and hard, the quality of education will rapidly improve. Isn't the example of Beijing No. 43 Middle School a clear illustration of this point?

The comprehensive improvement of the quality of secondary school education, like other types of schools, is a victory for the Party's education policy and a victory for the Party's mass line. We must continue our efforts, not be arrogant or impetuous, adapt to the situation of the comprehensive leap forward on the education front, thoroughly oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, and rapidly improve the quality of secondary school education by another step.

### 全面提高中等学校的教育质量

　　全面提高中等学校的教育质量
    中等教育是我国整个教育事业的一个重要环节。中等学校教学质量的全面提高对整个教育事业的发展有极大的好处。中等学校为中学生打好了全面发展的底子，他们进入高等学校，就能够更好地进行政治的专业的学习，从而造就出社会主义建设需要的又红又专的人材。中学教育质量的高低和学生成绩的优劣，绝不单是学校本身和学生个人的事情，而是关系到如何更好地为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义建设服务的重大问题。所以，进一步提高中等学校的教育质量，具有重大政治意义。
    在党的教育方针正确指导下，中等学校的教学质量有了显著的提高。我们应当认真总结和推广大跃进以来中等学校所创造的丰富经验，反对右倾保守思想，并在这个基础上进一步提高中等学校的教育质量。今天本报发表的福建省中等教育事业在党的领导下全面跃进的经验，很值得重视。这是中等教育事业贯彻执行党的总路线和教育方针的范例之一。
    提高教育质量，最根本的因素是加强党对学校的领导，坚持政治挂帅。社会主义教育事业，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的重要组成部分，是无产阶级改造旧社会，建立新社会的强有力的工具。所以，社会主义教育事业必须由党来领导。许多中等学校在这方面也取得了重要的经验。那就是，党对学校的领导，不仅管政治思想工作和生产劳动，同时还要管教学业务工作。党领导教学业务工作，首先而且主要的是政治挂帅，掌握教学的思想政治方向，使教学工作能够按照党的教育方针进行。江苏省中等学校领导干部亲自教课，从教学实践中摸索经验来领导教学。中共福建省委紧紧地抓住党对中等学校的领导，明确政治方向，充分调动师生的积极性，采取各种措施提高教学质量，使该省中等学校的面貌迅速改观。这就说明，只有加强党的领导，才能够把教学工作作好。为了加强党的领导，还有必要从组织上配备党的骨干，建立和健全党的组织，改变某些中学党的组织比较薄弱的情况。同时中学的青年团和少先队的组织，在推动青少年学习中，发挥了很大的作用。党组织应当继续加强对他们的领导，把他们作为有力的助手。
    坚定不移地贯彻执行党的教育方针，是全面提高教学质量的根本保证。有人认为贯彻教育方针，就要降低质量，把政治和业务、教学和劳动对立起来。这是不对的。实行教育与生产劳动相结合是一场深刻的革命，是在教育事业上的两条道路的斗争。各地中等学校，在党组织的领导下，批判了各色各样的资产阶级教育思想，又组织广大师生认真地学习党的教育方针、政策，提高了师生的政治觉悟和思想水平。对于某些缺点，及时加以纠正，从而在学校中造成一种生气勃勃、师生团结的政治局面，建立了一种崭新的社会主义的教育秩序。教学工作、思想政治工作、生产劳动等都要在总的方针下作统筹安排。对于年龄尚轻的青少年来说，应当进行力所能及的劳动，并可结合进行中等学校的科学技术活动。有人认为中学生从事力所能及的劳动，就是意味着可以不重视劳动，这显然是错误的。党的教育方针是我国社会主义教育事业的根本方针，不管哪类、哪级学校，都要根据特点，坚定不移地贯彻党的教育方针。
    中等教育是基础教育。主要学科，比如语文、数学、物理、化学、外国语等等应该抓紧。但是，还要关怀学生德育、体育的的发展。我们学校教育，是把新的一代培养成为有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者。要加强青少年共产主义的思想、风格和集体主义的精神，也要增强他们的体质。这些都是与生产劳动密切相关的。中学生参加生产劳动之后，思想上起了深刻的变化，把从事体力劳动视为乐事，操行、道德品质有很大提高。福建省诏安一中一年来，在劳动、学习等方面涌现的模范人物有七百二十人次。屹立在海防前哨的晋江第三中学，在去年粉碎美帝国主义和蒋介石集团在台湾海峡进行的挑衅战斗中，学生冒着敌人炮火踊跃支援前线，曾被共青团中央授予“全国社会主义先进集体”的光荣称号，并被福建前线解放军某部评为三等集体功。安徽省的学生把参加生产劳动前后的变化比喻为：“药罐子”变成了“铁弹子”。参加生产劳动，可以扩大和提高学生的知识水平，使他们不仅有了书本知识，而且有了感性知识，学会了工业、农业等方面的生产技能，他们既能从事脑力劳动，又能从事体力劳动，这样做，不但不会降低而且是大大提高教育质量。只就学生的考试成绩来看，福建省今年报考高等学校考试及格的学生达到62.8％，而1954年报考高等学校及格的学生仅占5.6％；安徽省也由比较落后的状况一跃而为全国较好的省份之一；江苏省中等教育质量，也有很大提高。这些成就是坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针的结果，是全面提高教育质量的结果。
    教师队伍的政治思想和业务水平的提高，对提高教育质量起着直接的作用。学校的领导干部必须政治挂帅，刻苦地钻研业务，要把党的群众路线运用到实际工作中去，正确地贯彻党的知识分子的政策，从政治上、工作上、生活上关心教师，启发和鼓舞他们的积极性。教师要不断提高政治思想水平，改造思想，树立起阶级观点、群众观点、集体主义观点、劳动观点和辩证唯物主义观点。此外，还必须不断提高文化水平和业务能力。福建和安徽的党组织在全面提高中等教育质量的过程中，紧紧抓住教师的政治思想工作，同时又不放松对教师业务水平的提高，对师资质量的提高，取得了很大成绩。辽阳第一高中抓住教师备课、讲授、辅导等许多教学环节，根据理论联系实际的原则进行了教学方法的改革，提高了教学水平。贵州仁怀县第一中学采取了新老教师挂钩，边教边学，开展教学研究的办法，提高了新教师的教学能力。这些都是很好的经验。在中学教师工作中，班主任工作占有重要地位，必须加强。一切教师不仅在政治上、业务上，而且在日常生活中，都要成为青少年的表率。
    福建等地的经验证明，中等学校的教育质量是能够迅速提高的。现在已经有大批的原来基础、条件较差的学校迎头赶上了先进学校。它们能够赶上先进学校的原因是什么呢？重要的一条是不断克服右倾思想，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，以饱满的革命干劲，勇于克服困难，变不利条件为有利条件。北京市第四十三中学，原来许多教师认为学校规模小、设备差，没有办法办好。学校党组织就大破“唯条件论”，克服畏难情绪，反复向教师进行了如何正确对待客观困难的教育，并经常总结工作、鼓舞士气，结果教学质量显著提高，超过不少基础相当好的学校。这个事实说明了“事在人为”的真理。人们说得好，凡事就怕认真，只要认真，就能把事情办好。在教学上，只要教师挖空心思，千方百计的去教去导，学生又能认真刻苦去学，教育质量就会迅速提高，北京市第四十三中学的例子不是清楚的说明这点吗？
    中等学校教育质量的全面提高，同其它各类学校一样，是党的教育方针的胜利，是党的群众路线的胜利。我们一定要再接再厉，不骄不躁，适应教育战线上全面跃进的形势，反透右倾保守思想，迅速把中等学校的教育质量再提高一步。
