Industry, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Sideline Occupations Each Display Their Talents
Peng Ke, Director of Dongfeng People's Commune

The People's Commune has many people and great strength; nothing is too difficult. Take our commune, for example: more than 970 laborers can basically display their respective talents in the fields of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, truly using steel where it is needed most.

All 38 of our commune's good marksmen have gone into the deep mountains and old forests. In the three months of August, September, and October, they hunted more than 2,000 wild animals such as wild donkeys and argali sheep. When the commune members carried these things back, they were truly happy. The commune also sent hundreds of laborers to engage in sideline occupations. From May to November, they have dug up large quantities of medicinal materials such as rhubarb, *chufa* (tiger nuts), and fritillary bulbs, generating an income of more than 594,000 yuan. This has not only supported national construction and medical needs, but has also improved our own lives. A commune member named Gaile has four laborers in his family. From May to August, in just four months, he received more than 430 yuan from sideline occupations, and each month he could also receive 48 *jin* (24 kilograms) of wild game meat. He is even more motivated. One day, he dug up more than 3,000 *jin* (1.5 tonnes) of rhubarb by himself.

Speaking of running industry, we had never even heard of it in the past. Everything made of iron had to be bought from hundreds of *li* (tens of kilometers) away. Now, the commune has iron and wood factories, producing large quantities of agricultural and animal husbandry tools and furniture, which has greatly reduced the difficulties for everyone in production and life.

Looking at agriculture, herdsmen didn't know how to grow crops before, and even to eat a bite, they had to ask from other places. This year, we have reclaimed more than 5,000 *mu* (333 hectares) of wasteland and learned how to grow crops. Next year, in addition to achieving self-sufficiency in grain, we will also sell surplus grain to the state.

Will diverting so many laborers to run factories, cultivate land, and engage in sideline occupations delay animal husbandry production? No. In animal husbandry, we have allocated 326 laborers. The herds are smaller than before, and herding is done in groups, so the livestock are all fat and strong. This year, the preparations for livestock overwintering have been particularly good. Large livestock have pens, and small livestock have sheds. More than 50 folk veterinarians have also been trained, and animal diseases are eliminated wherever they occur. (Attached picture)

    工、农、牧、副各显本领
    东风人民公社社长　彭科
    人民公社人多力量大，干啥事情也难不住。拿我们社来说吧，九百七十多个劳力，基本上都能按照他们自己的擅长，在工、农、牧、副各条战线上各显各的本领，真是把钢用到了刀刃上。
    我们社三十八个好枪手都进了深山、老林，8、9、10三个月中就打了野驴、石羊等野牲两千多头（只），当社员们往回驮这些东西时，真是心里乐得开了花。社里还派出几百劳力搞副业，5月到11月已挖到大批大黄、蕨麻、贝母等药材，收入五十九万四千多元，不但支援了国家建设和医疗方面的需要，我们自己的生活也宽裕了。有个叫盖勒的社员，家里四个劳力，从5月到8月的四个月中，光在副业上就分得了四百三十多元，每月还可分到四十八斤野牲肉。他的干劲更足啦，有一天他一个人就挖到大黄三千多斤。
    提起办工业，我们过去听也没听说过，凡是铁制的东西，都要跑到几百里地以外去买。现在，社里有铁、木工厂，制出大批农、牧工具和家具，给大家在生产上和生活上减少了很多困难。
    再看看农业，以前牧民就不知道种庄稼，吃一口也要伸手往外地要。今年我们开荒五千多亩，并且学会了种庄稼。明年我们除了要达到粮食自给外，还要卖余粮给国家。
    我们分出这么多劳力办工厂、种地、搞副业，会不会耽误了畜牧业生产呢？不会。在畜牧业上，我们放了三百二十六个劳力。畜群比以前划小了，还作到了跟群放牧，牲畜个个膘肥体壮。今年牲畜过冬准备工作搞的特别好，大畜有圈、小畜有棚，还培养了五十多名民间兽医，畜病发生在哪里，就消灭在哪里。（附图片）
