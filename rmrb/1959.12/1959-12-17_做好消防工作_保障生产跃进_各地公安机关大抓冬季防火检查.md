To do a good job in fire prevention and ensure production leap forward, public security organs in various regions vigorously conduct winter fire prevention inspections.

(Reported by this newspaper) In order to strengthen fire prevention work, various regions, under the leadership of the Party committees and relying on the broad masses, have launched safety campaigns centered on fire prevention. Daowai District in Harbin, Xiangtan Power Plant in Hunan, and Taokeng People's Commune in Chaling County, Hunan, have not experienced fires for a long time. Now, public security organs in many places are vigorously carrying out winter fire prevention work to ensure the safety of people's lives and production leap forward.

In order to safeguard the safety of people's lives and production construction, Harbin City launched a safety campaign centered on fire prevention in April this year, which has been very effective. Daowai District in the city has more than 70,000 households, with concentrated housing, mostly old buildings made of earth and wood, which are prone to fire if one is slightly careless. The public security departments in Harbin City launched a fire prevention safety campaign here that combined mobilizing the masses and the fire department. They mobilized more than 18,000 cadres and masses, and after half a month, conducted a comprehensive and thorough inspection of the fire safety situation of residents' use of fire and factories and enterprises. It was found that many residents' chimneys and stoves had cracks and fire, some close to the beams, wooden boards, and ceilings, posing a fire hazard. At the same time, it was also found that many newly established industries, due to starting from scratch and making do with whatever was available, had many problems in the use of fire and electricity in drying rooms, ovens, oil refining, canteens, and other departments. In response to these situations, the public security departments and the masses worked together to carry out repairs, demolitions, and reconstructions, and tightened the regulations on the use of fire and electricity, thus completely eliminating fire hazards. Therefore, from April this year to the present, there has not been a single fire.

Xiangtan County Thermal Power Plant in Hunan Province has been expanded five times over the years, and its power generation has increased dozens of times, but because the plant has always attached importance to fire prevention work, there have been no fires for ten years. They designated cables, oil switches, porcelain bottles, transformers, boilers, calcium carbide barrels, and other places most likely to cause fires as key fire prevention areas, established a complete set of fire prevention systems, and implemented "everyone engages in production, everyone engages in fire prevention," making fire prevention work mass-based and institutionalized. The Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League of the power plant also regard fire prevention work as important as production, incorporating it into regular central work, continuously carrying out publicity and education, inspection and evaluation, and rewarding good practices, so everyone in the plant has a fire prevention concept, ensuring safety.

Taokeng People's Commune in Chaling County, Hunan Province, is full of deep mountains and dense forests, with towering ancient trees. In the past, due to the poverty of the people, they often set fires to burn mountains to drive away animals and reclaim wasteland, causing continuous forest fires and causing losses to the country's forest resources. People also often caused fires in their daily lives, resulting in hardship. Since 1951, the local Party committee and government have vigorously publicized the importance of fire prevention and resource protection to the masses, put forward the slogan "Everyone is responsible for protecting forests and preventing fires," and adopted various methods such as setting up fire prevention propagandists, posting wall newspapers, writing slogans, and setting up fire prevention signs to carry out in-depth publicity and education, changing the habits of the masses and establishing a fire prevention concept. They also universally organized fire prevention groups and fire brigades, and established fire prevention forecast systems, thus eliminating fires. In order to make fire prevention work regular, in 1958, they put forward the slogan "Fire prevention is like preventing the enemy, protecting mountains is like protecting grain," mobilized the masses to calculate loss accounts and income accounts, visited the site, conducted mutual evaluations, and strengthened fire prevention work. On this basis, the masses created more than 5,400 bamboo water guns and carried more than 7,500 loads of sand, ensuring that every household has a bamboo water gun and every household has sandbags in front of the door. Because the publicity and education work is regular and in-depth, Chen Yinggeng, an old man in his sixties, originally took disaster lightly and believed that "everything is determined by heaven, and human prevention is useless," but in recent years, he has been successively rated as a model for forest protection and fire prevention in the county, district, and commune. Chaling County, Hunan, has designated this commune as a forest protection and fire prevention red flag for the entire county to promote their experience.

Recently, the public security departments of many provinces and cities have combined production with winter fire prevention inspections and launched safety campaigns centered on fire prevention to ensure the safety of people's lives and production leap forward.

    做好消防工作　保障生产跃进
    各地公安机关大抓冬季防火检查
    本报讯　为了加强消防工作，各地在党委领导下，依靠广大群众，开展了以防火为中心的安全运动，哈尔滨道外区，湖南湘潭发电厂和湖南茶陵县桃坑人民公社长期没有发生火灾。现在很多地方的公安机关都大抓冬季防火工作，以保障人民生活和生产跃进的安全。
    为了保障人民生活和生产建设的安全，哈尔滨市在今年4月间开展了以防火为中心的安全运动，收效很大。这个市的道外区居住着七万多户，房屋集中，多是土木结构的旧建筑物，稍一不慎就易引起火灾。哈尔滨市的公安部门便在这里展开了发动群众和消防部门相结合的防火安全运动，动员了一万八千多名干部和群众，经过半个月的时间，对全区居民用火和工厂企业的消防情况进行了全面彻底的检查，发现有很多居民的烟囱和炉灶裂缝窜火，有的靠近房梁、木板、天棚，有火险之虞。同时还发现了不少新办的工业，因白手起家，因陋就简，在干燥室、烘炉、熬油、食堂等部门的用火用电上也存在着很多问题。针对这些情况，公安部门和群众一起，进行了修缮、拆除、改建等工作，严密了用火用电的规定，比较彻底地堵绝了火患，因此从今年4月到现在，没有发
  生一起火灾。
    湖南省湘潭县火力发电厂历年来扩建五次，发电量增加了数十倍，但因这个厂一贯重视防火工作，因此十年无火灾。他们对电缆、油开关、瓷瓶、变压器、锅炉、电石桶等最易引起火灾的地方，划为消防重点，建立了一套完整的消防制度，实行“人人搞生产，个个搞消防”，使消防工作群众化，制度化。发电厂的党、政、工、团也把消防工作同生产一样看待，纳入经常的中心工作中去，不断进行宣传教育和检查评比，并对好的实行奖励，因此这个厂人人都有消防观念，保证了安全。
    湖南省茶陵县桃坑人民公社到处是深山密林，古木参天，过去因人民生活贫困，经常放火烧山驱兽，开荒，不断发生森林大火，造成国家森林资源的损失。群众在生活用火中也经常失火成灾，造成生活困难。1951年以来，这个地方的党委和政府就大力向群众宣传防火、保护资源的重要性，提出了“护林防火，人人有责”的口号，采取了普遍设防火宣传员，贴墙报，写标语，设防火牌等各种办法，进行深入宣传教育，改变了群众的习惯，树立了防火观念。并且普遍组织了消防小组、消防队，建立了消防预报等制度，因而消灭了火灾。为了使消防工作经常化，1958年他们又提出了“防火如防敌，保山如保粮”的口号，发动群众算损失账，算收益账，现场参观，互相评比，加强消防工作。在这个基础上群众创造了竹制水枪等防火工具五千四百多支，担沙七千五百多担，做到了户户有竹制水枪，家家门前有沙袋。由于宣传教育工作经常和深入，六十多岁的老人陈应庚原来轻灾麻痹，还认为是“万事由天定，人防没有用”，但近几年来连续六次被评为县、区和公社的护林防火模范。湖南茶陵县已将这个公社作为全县的护林防火红旗，推广他们的经验。
    最近，很多省市的公安部门结合生产进行冬季防火检查，展开了以防火为中心的安全运动，以保障人民生活和生产跃进的安全。
