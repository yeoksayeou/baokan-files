Jinan Huangtai Thermal Power Plant has completed the installation of a 25,000-kilowatt generator unit, which recently officially started generating electricity. This is the first high-temperature and high-pressure generator unit in Shandong Province.

Huangtai Power Plant is a regional power station, large in scale and technically complex. Its coal transportation, water supply, and instrument control systems are all automated. The electricity it generates after being put into production can basically meet the needs of the central Shandong region. The steel mills, cement plants, and capacitor paper workshops of the paper mills that have been built or are about to be built in Jinan City will be able to obtain ample power.

    济南增加新电源
    济南黄台火力发电厂一个二万五千瓩发电机组安装完毕，最近正式发电。这是山东省的第一个高温高压发电机组。
    黄台电厂是座区域性的电站，规模很大，技术复杂。它的运煤、供水和仪表控制系统都是自动化的。它投入生产后发出的电可以基本上满足鲁中区域的需要。济南市已经建成或即将建成的钢铁厂、水泥厂和造纸厂的电容器纸车间都能得到充裕的电力。
