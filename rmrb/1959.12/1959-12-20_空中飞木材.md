    Flying Timber in the Sky
    Recently, employees of the Forestry Bureau of Gaozhou County, Guangdong Province, created a single-line timber transport and automatic return aerial cableway. It is different from ordinary aerial cableways. General cableways have two methods of returning empty: one is to erect two lines, one for transporting timber and one for returning empty; the other is to wait for the transport vehicle to reach the end point, unload the timber, and then return to the starting point to carry timber. This cableway can simultaneously transport timber and return empty on the same line. When the vehicle carrying timber reaches the end point, it automatically unloads the timber, adjusts the vehicle, and returns. At the same time, another pair of vehicles carries timber and slides down, and the vehicles will not collide with each other when they meet midway. This saves a steel cable, which is a new creation.

    空中飞木材
    最近广东省高州县林业局职工创造一种叫单线运材同线自动回空架空索道。它和一般架空索道不同。一般索道有两种回空方法，一是架设两条线，一条运材，一条回空；另一种，是要等运材跑车到达终点卸下木材，再回到起点才能载运木材。这种索道能够在同一条线上同时运材和回空，当载运木材的跑车跑到终点，自动卸下木材后，将跑车调整就可返回，同时另一对跑车又载着木材往下滑行，跑车中途相遇不会互相碰撞。这样就节省一条钢索，这是一个新的创举。
