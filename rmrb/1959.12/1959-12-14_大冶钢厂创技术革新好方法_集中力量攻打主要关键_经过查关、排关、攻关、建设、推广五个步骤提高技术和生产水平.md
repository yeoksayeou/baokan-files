    Daye Steel Plant Creates Good Methods for Technological Innovation
    Concentrating Efforts to Tackle Key Problems
    Improving Technology and Production Levels Through Five Steps: Investigation, Screening, Problem-Solving, Construction, and Promotion
    (Our dispatch) Daye Steel Plant has fully mobilized the masses, organized comprehensive collaboration, concentrated its strength, concentrated its time, and launched a concentrated assault on key problems, which has simultaneously driven overall progress, rapidly ushering in a new upsurge of mass-based technological innovation and revolution, and creating a new situation of greater leaps forward in production. Daye Steel Plant calls this method the "Problem-Solving Campaign."
    From late August to the end of November, the plant organized five "Problem-Solving Campaigns" in just over three months, and production soared. According to incomplete statistics, in fifty-six days, the workers proposed one hundred and eighty-five key measures targeting thirty-three major key problems, of which twenty major key problems have been solved or basically solved, and one hundred and forty-one major measures have been implemented. The first campaign increased steel production by 11.56% and steel output by 19.24%. In August, the first month of the "Problem-Solving Campaign," steel production surged by 31%, and steel output surged by 39%. Subsequently, production increased month by month. Currently, steel and steel products have completed the annual plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. The fifth "Problem-Solving Campaign" is currently underway. Daily output is constantly setting new records. Product quality has been further improved, and the plant's costs have been reduced by an average of 12% in the last three months.
    Daye Steel Plant's steel and steel production doubled last year compared to the year before, and the 1959 production plan is to double again compared to 1958. To solve the contradiction of insufficient equipment capacity, the Daye Steel Plant Party Committee paid attention to taking many measures at the beginning of this year to mobilize the masses to carry out technological innovation and revolution. The predetermined production plan was basically completed in the first half of the year. However, the increase in production was very slow and unstable. In particular, due to the serious conservative thinking of some people, they believed that many of the Daye Steel Plant's equipment were very modern, and it would be very difficult to innovate. Therefore, although the masses had the enthusiasm to innovate technology, there was no unified goal, and they were only making piecemeal efforts, and few major problems were solved. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Daye Steel Plant Party Committee led the masses to criticize various conservative ideas and organized the "Problem-Solving Campaign" to lead the masses forward.
    The "Problem-Solving Campaign" is a good method of grasping major key issues under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, concentrating superior forces to fight a war of annihilation. More than one hundred problem-solving groups were formed throughout the plant, and more than four thousand people participated in the problem-solving shock team. Leading cadres went deep into the front lines to work with technicians and workers to study and solve problems. The whole plant cooperated with each other from top to bottom, left and right, and supported each other; with the main workshop as the mainstay, a variety of corps jointly launched problem-solving campaigns; technicians organized technical visiting teams, took the initiative to find key problems, and brought the technology to the door... Everyone twisted their strength into one rope. Technological innovation and revolution quickly formed a mass movement, and many major key problems were quickly solved. The use of horseshoe-shaped air rings is a major innovation in converters, which can shorten smelting time and extend furnace life. This innovation was proposed last year, but it was delayed for more than a year. In this problem-solving campaign, due to the breaking of conservative ideas and reliance on the masses, the workers of the steelmaking department and the engineering department cooperated greatly and completed this reform in only five days. This measure alone increased converter production by nearly one time. The "Problem-Solving Campaign" has also greatly promoted the in-depth development of the socialist labor competition, and many teams and individuals who have long been considered backward have also caught up. Many heavy manual labor has quickly realized mechanization and semi-mechanization, work efficiency has increased exponentially, and production needs have been met.
    The specific practices of the "Problem-Solving Campaign" of Daye Steel Plant are basically as follows: The first step is "Investigation." That is to mobilize the broad masses to find out the basic problems in production. There are many ways to investigate. Some are to hold worker symposiums, where everyone can make suggestions. Some are to conduct research by combining leading cadres, technicians and workers. Some are to expose problems through performance competitions. The second step is "Screening." The problems raised by the masses in the investigation have both major and minor aspects. This requires further mobilizing the masses to analyze, grasp the major essential problems, and rank them according to their importance and urgency, so as to determine the main direction of attack and specific tasks. In order to screen well, two meetings must be held: one is called the "Decision Meeting," that is, "four decisions" are made according to the key projects - according to the size and difficulty of the key problems, determine the goals, determine the measures, determine the time, and determine the people. The second meeting is called the "Balancing Meeting." The main task of this meeting is to balance the materials, equipment, and construction forces according to the measures proposed by each production unit. This can not only give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, but also accurately determine key issues. The third step is to mobilize the masses to concentrate their efforts on problem-solving. Problem-solving is essentially a stage of mobilizing the masses to engage in technological innovation and revolution. In the process of problem-solving, many old things were broken, but more new things were created. The fourth step is to vigorously promote construction, establish new operating procedures, process regulations, and management systems based on the achievements of technological innovation, consolidate the achievements that have been obtained, and keep management work up to date. The fifth step is to promote new technologies and new experiences and expand the results of the battle. Daye Steel Plant has adopted the method of holding on-site meetings in a timely manner to promote new experiences, and at the same time, many new creations have been formulated into new operating procedures, so that employees can widely adopt them, which makes it possible for various experiences to achieve a large-scale harvest in a timely manner.
    The experience of Daye Steel Plant's "Problem-Solving Campaign" has attracted the attention of various parts of Hubei. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is holding an on-site meeting in Huangshi City to promote the experience of Daye Steel Plant to the industrial front of the entire province.

    大冶钢厂创技术革新好方法
    集中力量攻打主要关键
    经过查关、排关、攻关、建设、推广五个步骤提高技术和生产水平
    本报讯　大冶钢厂全面发动群众，组织全面大协作，集中力量，集中时间，突击解决关键问题，同时带动全盘，迅速掀起了群众性的技术革新和技术革命高潮，使生产出现了更大跃进的新局面。大冶钢厂把这种办法叫作“攻关运动”。
    这个厂从8月下旬到11月底，在三个多月的时间内，共组织了五次攻关运动，生产扶摇直上。据不完全统计，五十六天的时间，职工们就针对三十三个重大关键，提出了一百八十五项关键性措施，已经攻破和基本攻破的重大关键有二十个，实现了一百四十一条主要措施。第一个战役就把钢产量提高了11.56％，钢材产量提高了19.24％。开展“攻关运动”的第一月——8月份，钢产量猛增31％，钢材产量猛增39％；以后，产量又逐月增长；现在，钢和钢材已经提前超额完成了全年计划。目前，正在进行第五次攻关。日产量不断创造新纪录。产品质量进一步提高，全厂成本最近三个月平均降低了12％。
    大冶钢厂去年钢和钢材的产量比前年翻了一番，1959年的产量又计划比1958年翻一番。为了解决设备能力不足等矛盾，大冶钢厂党委在今年一开始就注意采取许多措施，发动群众开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。上半年基本上完成了预定的生产计划。但是产量提高很慢，而且不太稳定。特别是由于部分人保守思想严重，他们认为大冶钢厂的许多设备都很现代化了，要革新十分困难，因此群众虽有革新技术的热情，但是没有统一的奋斗目标，只是零打碎敲，重大问题解决很少。党的八届八中全会以后，大冶钢厂党委领导群众批判了各种保守思想，又组织“攻关运动”领导群众前进。
    “攻关运动”是在党委统一领导下，抓住主要关键问题，集中优势力量打歼灭战的一种好方法。全厂各单位组成了一百多个攻关小组，四千多人参加了攻关突击队。领导干部深入现场同技术人员和工人一起劳动，研究和解决问题。全厂上下左右通力合作，互相支援；以主办车间为主，开展多种兵团联合攻关；技术人员组织技术访问队，主动上门找关键，把技术送上门……大家把力量扭成了一股绳。技术革新和技术革命迅速形成群众运动，许多重大关键很快就解决了。使用马蹄形风圈是转炉的一大革新，它可以缩短冶炼时间，延长炉子寿命。这项革新去年就有人提出过，拖了一年多没有实现。这次攻关运动中，由于打破了保守思想，依靠了群众，炼钢部的工人和工程处大协作，只花了五天的时间就完成了这一改革。仅这一项措施，就使转炉产量提高了将近一倍。“攻关运动”还大大推动了社会主义劳动竞赛的深入开展，许多长期被认为落后的班组和个人也赶上来了。许多笨重的体力劳动很快就实现了机械化和半机械化，工作效率成倍提高，满足了生产需要。
    大冶钢厂“攻关运动”的具体作法，基本如下：第一步是“查关”。就是发动广大群众摸清生产中的基本问题。查关的方法多种多样，有的是召开工人座谈会，由大家提；有的是领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合进行研究；有的是通过表演赛使问题暴露出来。第二步是“排关”。查关中群众提出的问题，有主要的也有次要的，这就要继续发动群众进行分析，抓住主要的本质的问题，并根据轻重缓急等进行排队，确定主攻方向和具体任务。为了排好关，要开好两个会：一个叫“定关会”，即按关键项目进行“四定”——根据关键的大小难易，定指标，定措施，定时间，定人。第二个会叫作“平衡会”。这个会的主要任务是，根据每个生产单位提出的措施要求，进行物资材料、设备和施工力量的平衡。这样就既能充分发挥群众的积极性，又能把关键问题定得准确无误。第三步是发动群众集中力量进行攻关。攻关，实质上就是个发动群众大搞技术革新和技术革命的阶段。在攻关中，破了许多旧的东西，但创造出更多的新东西。第四步就要大抓建设，根据技术革新的成果，订立新的操作规程、工艺规程和管理制度，把已经获得的成果巩固起来，使管理工作跟上去。第五步是推广新技术和新经验，扩大战果。大冶钢厂采取了及时召开现场会议的办法来推广新的经验，同时把许多新创造制订为新的操作规程，使职工们广泛采用，这就使各种经验都能及时得到大面积丰收。
    大冶钢厂“攻关运动”的经验已经引起湖北各地的注意。中共湖北省委正在黄石市召开现场会议，向全省工业战线推广大冶钢厂这一经验。（附图片）
