Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th - The Datong Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province has completed the annual state plan ahead of schedule. As of December 28th, the total output value was 112.39% of the plan, raw coal production was 107.04% of the plan, raw coal costs were 7.85% lower than last year, timber consumption per thousand tons was 18.5% lower than last year, and the tunneling footage reached the annual plan target.

This year, the workers of the Datong Mining Bureau vigorously promoted many new coal mining methods in the large-scale high-yield red flag competition, and implemented the experience of four-shift cross-operation, with an average monthly output of 14,037 tons per working face, achieving large-scale high-yield results. In terms of vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, the workers of the Datong Mining Bureau have also achieved many new achievements this year. They have successfully created and produced in batches coal-loading machines for retreat mining and coal-loading machines for mine cars, changing the situation of insufficient coal loading and unloading capacity.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th - Shouwangfen Copper Mine, one of China's large copper mines, has completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. As of December 25th, copper concentrate production exceeded the state plan by 0.0023%, an increase of 37% over last year; the total output value and the quality of copper concentrate also exceeded the annual plan targets.

The Party Committee of Shouwangfen Copper Mine, in launching a campaign among all mine workers to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, firmly grasped the "three sides" (participating in production, leading production, and discovering and solving problems) leadership method, continuously broke through weak links in production, and promoted production to leap forward again and again. The copper concentrate recovery rate in the flotation workshop of the concentrator was very low, affecting the increase in refined copper production. After the secretary of the mine's Party Committee worked in this workshop, he studied and improved the operating methods with veteran workers and technicians every day, increasing the copper concentrate recovery rate from 80% to 85%. The output of copper concentrate in August increased by 18.6% compared with July, and in September it increased by 33.74% compared with August. Since entering December, the daily output of copper has soared. As of the 24th, the copper output in only twenty-four days was equivalent to 2.5 times the total monthly copper output in July.

While completing this year's production plan ahead of schedule, the workers of Shouwangfen Copper Mine have also made various preparations for a "good start" in production next year. At present, the mine has enough copper ore stored for the first quarter of next year's production.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - Nanjing Chemical Industry Company has completed its annual production tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. As of December 25th, the total output value exceeded the annual plan by 25.3%; the output of various chemical fertilizers and important chemical raw materials included in the state plan has all been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the state plan. The total cost of comparable products was reduced by 3.5% compared with the annual plan, and the labor productivity of all employees increased by 9.5% compared with 1958.

Party organizations at all levels of the Nanjing Chemical Industry Company insisted on carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and mobilized workers to vigorously engage in technological innovation, thereby ensuring the continuous improvement of the production capacity of major production equipment. Under the conditions of using the same raw materials, the daily production capacity of each water-gas furnace for synthetic ammonia increased from 40 tons to 50 tons, ensuring the need for increased synthetic ammonia production. This year, under the condition of basically no increase in major equipment, the daily output of sulfuric acid in the fourth quarter increased by more than 50% compared with the beginning of the year.

Since August, the entire company, under the slogan of "high every ten days, exceeding every month," has launched a vigorous technical performance competition, realizing a continuous leap forward in production and providing a strong guarantee for completing the annual plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 30th - Nanping Paper Mill in Fujian Province, which won the Red Flag Award at the National Conference of Heroes and is one of the three major newsprint mills in the country, has completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule in all aspects. Among them, the total output value was completed 19 days ahead of schedule, the output of newsprint was completed 11 days ahead of schedule, and the output of mechanical wood pulp was completed 14 days ahead of schedule; the product qualification rate exceeded the plan by 3.83%, the labor productivity exceeded the plan by 4.28%, and the average unit cost of paper was reduced by 29.6%.

In the process of completing the annual production tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, the workers of Nanping Paper Mill vigorously engaged in technological innovation, broke through key production bottlenecks, and put forward more than 1,300 innovation proposals, reformed more than 50 tools and equipment, and increased work efficiency by one to fifty times. At the same time, all the workers of the factory also adopted the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and first indigenous and then foreign methods, and successively trial-produced equipment such as AC welding machines, electric winches, gantry planers, and cement grinding stones, creating more than 85,000 yuan of wealth for the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th - Twenty-five large-scale coal mines in Hebei Province have excellently completed various preparatory tasks to ensure a "good start" in production next year.

As early as three months ago, these large-scale coal mines were grasping both production and tunneling. Up to now, they have prepared working faces for more than half a year of coal production for next year's production. Most of the standby working faces to be put into production in January next year have been installed with mechanical and electrical equipment. As long as the coal miners move the electric drill and coal cutting machine, they can start coal mining.

The electromechanical maintenance workers of each mine broke the old practice of stopping production during holidays for centralized maintenance, and began intense equipment maintenance work in early December, and achieved maintenance without reducing production. As of December 30th, the small machinery of large coal mines in the province and 147 key maintenance projects have all been checked, and more than 27,000 sets of winches, electric chutes, electric motors, combines and other coal mining, transportation, and ventilation machinery have been repaired. The efficiency of the machinery and equipment after maintenance has been improved compared with the past. The workers of the machine repair plants in each mine have also rushed to manufacture a batch of mechanical spare parts for next year.

At present, under the leadership of the Party Committee, the workers of each mine are carrying out a mass technical training movement in which everyone summarizes experience and everyone practices their skills.

　　新年前夕捷报纷飞
    大同煤矿、寿王坟铜矿、南京化学工业公司、南平造纸厂喜得全年红
    河北二十五座大型煤矿做好了明年“开门红”的各项准备
    新华社太原30日电　山西省大同矿务局已提前完成全年国家计划。到12月28日止，总产值完成112.39％，原煤产量完成107.04％，原煤成本比去年降低7.85％，坑木千吨消耗比去年降低18.5％，掘进进尺达到了年度计划指标。
    今年，大同矿务局职工在大面积丰产红旗竞赛中，大力推广了许多新的采煤方法，并且推行了四班交叉作业的经验，平均每个工作面月产量达到一万四千零三十七吨，取得了大面积高额丰产成绩。在大闹技术革新和技术革命方面，大同矿务局职工今年也取得了许多新成就。他们先后创造成功并且成批生产了回采装煤机和棚车装煤机，改变了原煤装卸力量不足的局面。
    新华社天津29日电　我国大型铜矿之一——寿王坟铜矿，已提前超额完成了全年生产计划。到12月25日止，铜精粉产量超过国家计划0.0023％，比去年增长37％；总产值和铜精粉质量，也都超过了年度计划指标。
    寿王坟铜矿党委在发动全矿职工开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动中，狠狠地抓住了“三边”（边参加生产、边领导生产、边发现问题解决问题）领导方法，不断突破生产薄弱环节，促使生产一跃再跃。选矿厂浮选车间的铜精粉采收率很低，影响精铜产量的提高，矿党委书记到这个车间跟班劳动后，每天同老工人、技术员研究改进操作方法，使铜精粉回收率由80％提高到85％。8月份铜精粉的产量比7月份提高了18.6％，9月比8月提高了33.74％。进入12月以来，铜的日产量扶摇直上，截至24日止，仅二十四天的铜产量就相当于7月份全月铜产量的二点五倍。
    寿王坟铜矿的职工在提前完成今年生产计划的同时，还为明年生产“开门红”做好了各项准备工作。目前，这个矿储存的铜矿石，已足够明年第一季度生产用。
    新华社南京30日电　南京化学工业公司已经提前超额完成年度生产任务。到12月25日止，总产值比年计划超额了25.3％；各种化学肥料和重要化工原料等列入国家计划的主要产品的产量，都提前超额完成了国家计划。可比产品总成本比年计划降低3.5％，全员劳动生产率比1958年提高9.5％。
    南京化学工业公司各级党组织坚持大搞群众运动，并且发动职工大闹技术革新，从而保证了主要生产设备的生产能力不断提高。合成氨的水煤气炉在使用相同原料的条件下，每座炉的日产能力从四十吨提高到五十吨，保证了合成氨增产的需要。今年在基本上没有增加主要设备的情况下，硫酸日产量第四季度比年初提高50％以上。
    8月份以来，全公司在旬旬高、月月超的口号下，开展了蓬蓬勃勃的技术表演赛，实现了生产的持续跃进，为提前超额完成全年计划提供了有力的保证。
    新华社福州30日电　获全国群英会红旗奖、全国三大新闻纸厂之一的福建省南平造纸厂，提前全面完成了今年的国家计划。其中，总产值提前十九天完成，新闻纸产量提前十一天完成，机械木浆提前十四天完成；产品合格率超过计划3.83％，劳动生产率超过计划4.28％，纸的平均单位成本降低29.6％。
