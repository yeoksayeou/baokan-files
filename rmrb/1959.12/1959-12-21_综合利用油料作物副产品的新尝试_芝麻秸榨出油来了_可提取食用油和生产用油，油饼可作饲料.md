　　New Attempts at Comprehensive Utilization of Oil Crop By-Products
    Sesame Stalks Can Now Be Pressed for Oil!
    Edible and Industrial Oil Can Be Extracted, and Oil Cake Can Be Used as Feed

    (Our dispatch) The extraction of oil from sesame stalks has been successfully tested in many regions. This not only directly increases the country's oil production, but also opens up avenues for the comprehensive utilization of oil crop by-products.

    Regions that have successfully experimented with extracting oil from sesame stalks include Dancheng and Shangcai in Henan, Hengshui, Xinle, Hejian, Yanshan in Hebei, Jieshou, Fuyang, Chuxian, Lai'an, Quanjiao, and Huoqiu in Anhui, Lixian in Hunan, Hancheng in Shaanxi, and Feixian in Shandong. Although the oil yield varies in these regions and the oil quality is generally not very high, their practices have definitively proven that sesame stalks and other oil crop by-products, which used to be burned as firewood, can be widely and comprehensively utilized. It not only increases the supply of edible and industrial oil in rural areas, but also increases the source of pig feed. For example, in Dancheng County, Henan Province, about five jin of relatively low-quality edible oil can be extracted from every hundred jin of sesame stalks. If sesame stalk oil extraction in the entire province of Henan reaches this standard, it can increase oil production by more than 30 million jin per year; even if calculated at three jin of oil extracted per hundred jin, the annual increase could still be more than 18 million jin. After the extraction of edible oil, the remaining crude oil can be refined to remove moisture and used as a lubricant for carts, waterwheels, or agricultural implements. The oil cake left after sesame stalk oil extraction can also be used as feed for pigs and livestock. According to tests conducted by the Henan Provincial Bureau of Light Industry and the Grain Bureau in Shangcai and Dancheng, Henan, sesame stalk oil cake contains 4.92% crude protein, 12.69% nitrogen-free extract, 33.2% crude fiber, and trace amounts of crude fat, phosphorus, iron, calcium, etc. Because the sesame stalks are steamed and stir-fried, the fibers have been softened and have a slightly fragrant smell, making them very palatable to pigs.

    The technology for extracting oil from sesame stalks is not too complicated. Generally, it only requires processes such as material selection, baking and frying, crushing, steaming, and pressing, which can be done using rural-style oil presses. According to existing experience, raw materials should be yellow and fresh, using only the upper part with the pods, while the lower part can be used as fuel; the frying should be done carefully to avoid burning, until it turns a yellowish-brown color; the crushing should be as fine as possible, and it is necessary to screen and remove impurities while crushing. Steaming the material is best done twice, and the temperature should be above 100 degrees Celsius. These technical experiences are not yet fully mature, and various regions are further improving operational methods to improve the quality of the finished oil, so as to make this experience richer and more complete.

　　综合利用油料作物副产品的新尝试
    芝麻秸榨出油来了
    可提取食用油和生产用油，油饼可作饲料
    本报讯　利用芝麻秸榨油已经在很多地区试验成功。这不仅直接为国家增产了油脂，而且为油料作物副产品的综合利用开辟了道路。
    目前已经试验用芝麻秸榨油成功的有河南的郸城、上蔡，河北的衡水、新乐、河间、盐山，安徽的界首、阜阳、滁县、来安、全椒、霍丘，湖南的澧县，陕西韩城，山东费县等地区。这些地区用芝麻秸榨油，虽然出油有多有少，油的质量一般还不够高，但是他们的实践已经肯定地证明，过去当作柴火烧掉的芝麻秸等油料作物副产品，可以广泛加以综合利用。它不仅能增加农村食用和生产用油，而且增加了猪饲料的来源。如河南省郸城县在用芝麻秸榨油时，每百斤芝麻秸一般能提取质量较次的食用油五斤左右，如果河南全省的芝麻秸榨油都达到这个标准，一年就可以增产油脂三千多万斤；如以每百斤提取油脂三斤计算，全年也可以增产一千八百多万斤。提取食用油以后，剩下的毛油经提炼，挥发部分水份还可以用作大车、水车或农具的润滑剂。芝麻秸榨油后的油饼，还可以作为猪及牲口的饲料。据河南轻工业局与粮食厅在河南上蔡、郸城等地化验，芝麻秸油饼中含有粗蛋白质4.92％、无氮浸出物12.69％、粗纤维33.2％以及微量的粗脂肪、磷、铁、钙质等。由于芝麻秸经过蒸炒，纤维已被软化并略带香味，用作饲料，猪很爱吃。
    芝麻秸榨油的技术并不太复杂，一般只要经过选料、烘炒、碾碎、蒸馏、压榨等操作过程，利用农村的土榨就可以加工。根据现有的经验，在选料时原料要色黄新鲜，只用上端带夹的部分，下部可作燃料；炒料要不焦不糊，炒到发焦黄色为好；粉碎要越细越好，必须边碾边筛，除去杂质。蒸料以蒸两次为好，温度要在一百度以上。这些技术上的经验还不够成熟，各地正在进一步改进操作方法，提高成品油的质量，以便使这一经验更加丰富、完整。
