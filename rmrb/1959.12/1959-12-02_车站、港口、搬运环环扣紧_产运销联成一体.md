Stations, Ports, and Handling Tightly Interlocked
Production, Transportation, and Sales Integrated
Changsha South Station, Port, and Handling units achieve great collaboration, reducing vehicle dwell time in the station from 12 hours to 5.1 hours; ship dwell time in the port from an average of 70 hours to 12 hours; handling efficiency increased by 1-3 times.

According to the New Hunan Daily, the "one-dragon" transportation collaboration red line connects the work of Changsha South Railway Station, the First Work Zone of Changsha Port, and the South District Transportation Office of Changsha Transportation Company into one. Every day, coal and manganese ore, accounting for more than 80% of the station's freight volume, are continuously transported by the "three dragons" composed of Red Flag trains and Red Flag fleets, closely combining production, transportation, and sales through station, port, and handling connections, greatly tapping transportation potential and improving transportation efficiency.

Currently, vehicle dwell time in the station has been reduced from 12 hours before collaboration to 5.1 hours, ship dwell time in the port has been reduced from an average of 70 hours to 12 hours, and handling efficiency has increased by 1-3 times. The transportation potential unearthed during this period is equivalent to an increase of 778 railcars and 2,400 ships, which can transport an additional 120,000 tons of goods. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an on-site meeting to promote this experience.

South Station is a key railway and shipping hub in Changsha City, and one of the hubs for water and land transportation of materials inside and outside Hunan Province. More than 70% of the goods arriving at and departing from the station must pass through the port for loading and unloading, and almost all of the port's throughput must be transshipped through the station. Handling is an essential intermediate link in the transportation of both the port and the station, and the three aspects are closely related. In the past, due to insufficient collaboration between the station, port, and handling, port and station congestion and cargo backlog occurred. In order to solve this problem, several parties jointly held a series of collaborative meetings, organizing cargo owners, cadres and workers to criticize departmentalism and establish the communist idea of station, port, and handling as one family. In April of this year, the station, port, and handling parties established a unified command structure - the Changsha South Station Transportation Command Branch, and implemented "five unifications": unification of thought, unification of planning, unification of consignment, unification of labor allocation, and unification of tool and equipment use. Subsequently, the railway station fixed two Red Flag trains running directly from Leiyang and Yongxing to the South Station for coal transportation, and the port fixed the Red Flag fleet running from Tantangzi to the First Work Zone of Changsha Port for manganese ore transportation, implementing direct transshipment between trains and ships.

Since the implementation of the "five unifications", good results have been achieved. First, transportation efficiency has been improved, the turnaround of vehicles and ships has been accelerated, and the tasks have been overfulfilled and completed ahead of schedule every month. Second, equipment potential has been tapped. For example, in the past, the station's electric winches and lighting equipment were only used by the station itself, and the port handling did not have these tools. When needed, they had to borrow from the station and pay electricity fees. After the collaboration, the tools were used jointly, giving full play to the equipment potential. At the same time, it facilitated cargo owners. Before the unification of planning and consignment, cargo owners had to go to several different locations to complete the consignment procedures. Now they only need to complete it once at the command branch, which is very convenient. In addition, due to the participation of personnel from all three parties in unloading, the timely loading and unloading of Red Flag trains and fixed-port and fixed-route fleets was guaranteed.

After the collaboration, due to the strengthening of manpower, material resources, and leadership, all employees quickly launched a high tide of tool innovation, creating many advanced indigenous and foreign tools. They built a 165-meter low-berth coal unloading line, which can save the transportation company 40 laborers per day. They also built a 360-meter-long coal unloading line, and expanded the coal storage yard, so that the station's coal storage capacity increased from more than 7,000 tons in the past to about 100,000 tons. At the same time, some modern electric mechanical equipment was installed. The entire loading, unloading, and handling operation has also basically achieved four modernizations, namely "electric winch for heavy cargo, chute for bulk cargo, carts for packaged cargo, and electric winch for uphill cargo." These measures have basically solved the contradiction of disconnection between trains, ships, and handling.

In order to adapt to the needs of "one-dragon" transportation collaboration, all parties at the station, port, and handling have improved their work. The station strengthened the management of the freight yard and strengthened forecasting and confirmation. A level of dispatching was also added to the station, on the one hand to grasp the operation of the station's trains, and on the other hand to execute the orders of the branch command, specifically allocating labor. In terms of handling, a professional team of about 60 people was fixed, and when there were assault tasks, all parties provided support. For example, on October 11, the station had 190 cars waiting to be loaded and unloaded. According to the station's existing strength, it could only load and unload about 100 railcars. The transportation company immediately transferred more than 150 people, completing the task on time. In terms of port services, special personnel were assigned to carry out collaboration, ensuring that ships were available for cargo arrival and cargo was unloaded upon ship arrival.

Now, the staff of Changsha South Station are striving to realize the mechanization of station, port, and handling transportation in the shortest possible time.

    车站、港口、搬运环环扣紧
    产运销联成一体
    长沙南站站、港、搬三单位大协作，车辆在站停留时间由12小时压缩到5.1小时；船只在港停留时间由平均70小时压缩到12小时；搬运效率提高了1—3倍。
    据新湖南报消息　站、港、搬“一条龙”运输大协作的红线，把长沙火车南站、长沙港第一作业区和长沙市运输公司南区运输处的工作，联成了一体。每天，占车站运量80％以上的煤焦、锰砂由红旗列车和红旗船队组成的“三条龙”，紧密结合产、运、销三方面，通过站、港、搬连接不断地运行，大大地挖掘了运输潜力，提高了运输效率。
    现在，车辆在站停留时间已由协作前的十二小时压缩到五点一小时，船只在港停留时间已由平均七十小时压缩到十二小时，搬运效率提高了一至三倍。这段期间挖掘出的运输潜力等于增加七百七十八个车皮、二千四百只船，可多运十二万吨货物。最近中共湖南省委召开了现场会，推广这个经验。
    南站是长沙市的铁路与航运重点，是湖南省内外物资水陆运输的枢纽之一。车站到发的货物有70％以上要通过港口吞吐，港口吞吐量几乎全部要通过车站转运，而搬运却是港、站的运输必经的中间环节，三方面关系十分密切。过去由于站、港、搬协作不够，造成了港站堵塞、货物积压。为了解决这个问题，几方面联合召开了一连串的协作会议，组织货主和干部职工，批判了本位主义思想，树立了站、港、搬一家的共产主义思想。今年4月，站、港、搬三方面成立了统一的指挥机构——长沙南站运输指挥分部，进行了“五统一”：思想统一、计划统一、托运统一、劳动力调配统一、工具设备使用统一。接着，车站固定了由耒阳和永兴直达南站运煤的两列定点红旗列车，港务固定了由炭塘子至长沙港第一作业区运锰砂的红旗船队，实行车船直接换装。
    “五统一”实行以来，收到了很好的效果。首先提高了运效，加速了车船周转，保证了月月超额、提前完成了任务。其次，挖掘了设备潜力。如过去车站的电动扒杆、照明设备只是车站自己使用，港口搬运没有这些工具，需要用时，要向车站借，交电费；协作以后，工具共同使用，发挥了设备潜力。同时，便利了货主。在计划、托运统一前，货主要分别到几个不同地点办理托运手续，现在只要在指挥分部一次办完，大为便利。此外，由于三方面人力参加卸货，保证了红旗列车和定港定线船队的及时装卸。
    在协作后，由于人力、物力和领导力量的加强，全体职工很快就掀起了一个工具革新的高潮，制造了许多先进的土、洋工具。他们修建了一个一百六十五米的低货位卸煤线，单运输公司每天可节约四十个劳力。还修了一条三百六十米长的卸煤线，并将储煤场扩大，使车站的储煤量由过去的七千多吨增加到十万吨左右。同时安装了部分现代化的电动机械设备。整个装卸、搬运作业也基本上实现了四化，即“笨重货物电动扒杆化、散装货物溜板化、包装货物车子化、起坡货物电动绞车化”。这些措施，基本上解决了车、船、搬衔接不上的矛盾。
    为了适应“一条龙”运输大协作的需要，站、港、搬各方面都改进了工作。车站加强了货场管理，加强了预报确报。还在站上加设了一级调度，一方面掌握车站的火车运行，一方面执行分指挥部的命令，具体调配劳力。在搬运方面，固定了约六十个人的专业队，有突击任务时，由各方面支援。如10月11日，车站有一百九十个待装、待卸的车，按车站现有力量，只能装卸一百个车皮左右，运输公司立即调来了一百五十多人，如时完成了任务。在港务上，派专人搞协作，做到了货到有船运、船到即起货。
    现在，长沙南站的职工们力争在最短时间内实现站、港、搬运输机械化。
