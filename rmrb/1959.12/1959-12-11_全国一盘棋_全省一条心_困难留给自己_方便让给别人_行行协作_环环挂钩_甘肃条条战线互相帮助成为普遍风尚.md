    The whole nation as one chessboard, the whole province as one heart  Leaving difficulties to ourselves, giving convenience to others
    All industries collaborate, every link connected
    A common practice in Gansu: Mutual assistance on all fronts.
    This newspaper reports that in Gansu Province, a communist spirit of cooperation with mutual assistance and support has become widespread across all fronts, creating a strong material foundation for the province's large-scale, high-speed socialist construction.
    The characteristics of this mutual assistance trend are: large scale, high style, with industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military all engaging in large-scale collaboration, unafraid of difficulties, without conditions, and without remuneration. The slogan is: "The whole nation as one chessboard, the whole province as one heart, leave difficulties to ourselves, give convenience to others, provide whatever is lacking and help to the end, mutual assistance becomes the fashion, let us all leap forward together." The industrial and capital construction systems exchange what they have and help each other in all aspects, including raw materials, machinery and equipment, human resources, technology, and design drawings, promoting mutual progress. Between the summer and autumn of this year, factories and capital construction units mutually supported each other with more than 3,000 tons of steel, more than 800 sets (pieces) of machinery and equipment, and more than 1,500 tons of cement. The critical equipment urgently needed by sixteen units was resolved. The Liujiaxia Hydroelectric Engineering Bureau, the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Lanzhou Railway Administration, the Yintao Shangshan Engineering Bureau, and Baiyin City frequently dispatched batches of labor and machinery, bringing their own tools, dry rations, and supplies to help each other in attacking key projects. This year, they completed the salt pot gorge Yellow River Cutoff and the Tao River Cutoff, and rapidly built the Lanzhou Aluminum Plant. The construction of the Lanzhou Aluminum Plant took half the time and cost two-thirds less than the construction of aluminum plants of the same scale in our country. During the Salt Pot Gorge Cutoff, more than 20 units supported it with machinery and manpower, and the technicians sent by various places to assist outnumbered all the technicians of the Salt Pot Gorge Engineering Office by more than double, thus ensuring that the raging Yellow River was cut off within 36 hours. The factories and mines currently engaged in paired competition help each other during the competition and help to the end. During the paired competition between the Lanzhou Glass Factory and the Lanzhou Enamel Thermos Factory, the latter lacked equipment and its furnace temperature was not high enough. The Glass Factory sent its own workshop director and four technicians with rich furnace burning experience, bringing their own melting furnace to support the other party. They helped with the operation for a week, and taught technology and solved problems during the operation, until the other party caught up with their own level.
    This year, the plan for industry to support agriculture has been repeatedly increased. The original plan was to manufacture 5,532 tons of various agricultural machinery, but by the end of October, 7,800 tons had been completed, and it has now been expanded to more than 10,400 tons. Moreover, all of them were prepared in advance during the agricultural season and transported to the countryside. In July and November, more than 2,700 technicians were dispatched in two groups to form rural service teams, going deep into various communes to help install, repair, and teach technology and consolidate commune-run factories. In July alone, they helped repair more than 460,000 pieces of agricultural implements. Many specialized enterprises that did not have the task of supporting agriculture also took the initiative to use leftovers, scraps, and surplus materials to manufacture agricultural machinery to support the countryside. The May 1st Machine Factory has set up eight special sales departments for the countryside. The Provincial Electric Power Industry Bureau provided manpower and materials to help the countryside establish 13 power plants and more than 100 hydroelectric stations, trained 433 commune power workers, and supported the gradual realization of electrification in the countryside.
    Agriculture's support for industry and cities is meticulous, providing whatever is needed. The annual purchase plans for grain, agricultural and sideline products, and livestock products throughout the province have all been completed ahead of schedule under the slogan of "farmers supporting industry to ensure construction." According to statistics from the Tianshui Special District in ten months, the district provided industry with wild fibers, wild starch, wild oilseeds, and wild chemical materials, etc., which increased more than tenfold compared with the same period last year. When the summer harvest arrived, capital construction and light industry lacked bamboo poles and bamboo strips, and some factories stopped work waiting for materials. After the news reached Longnan, the people's communes immediately extracted people from their busy schedules to rush to cut bamboo poles and transport them to Lanzhou.
    Examples of cooperation between special districts, counties, cities, and communes to build water conservancy projects and carry out various large-scale construction projects are even more common. Six ethnic groups in the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture mobilized tens of thousands of troops to help the Dongxiang people build the more than 140-kilometer-long Shangshan Canal - the Nanyang Canal, helping the "dry" Dongxiang people, who live at an altitude of more than 2,500 meters, get rid of the cap of drought.
    Under the guidance of the idea that only by ensuring production can we ensure supply, commercial sector employees have been treating factories as their homes, helping factories find raw materials, improve specifications and quality, and expand product sales. Since the beginning of this year, 213 new raw materials worth 980,000 yuan have been found for industry.
    Teachers and students of universities and middle schools throughout the province and veteran soldiers, in running schools diligently and thriftily and safeguarding and supporting socialist construction, frequently support industrial and agricultural production without remuneration. An air force unit dispatched aircraft to help rush equipment to speed up the construction of the Lanzhou Aluminum Plant, and a certain engineering unit helped the local area build a Yongdeng Iron and Steel Plant. Schools took agricultural leave to help with the harvest during the summer and autumn harvests.
    Mutual assistance has accelerated the socialist construction of the entire province. The basic construction plan of the entire province this year and the production plans of various factories and mines in Lanzhou City have all been overfulfilled 41 days ahead of schedule. After the successful conclusion of the "three autumns," more than 2.6 million laborers throughout the province immediately launched a large-scale water conservancy project. Now, 2.61 million mu of new water fields have been built, and 4.9 million mu of water fields have been renovated. In less than two months, the irrigation area has been expanded by more than 7.5 million mu. Commerce is developing a supply and marketing "one-dragon" service, and transportation is showing a new upsurge in the situation of "one network, five modernizations" and mutual assistance in road-mining cooperation.
    The widespread formation of the communist spirit of mutual assistance is the result of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee's persistent communist and socialist ideological education for the people for more than a year. At various meetings, the Party praised the communist style of the Baiyin City Transportation Administration Bureau and the Dingxi Special District Transportation Administration Bureau for unconditionally supporting the Dunhuang Transportation Company of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry with automobile tires and materials. While conducting positive education, the Party also insisted on fighting against departmentalism, which is the opposite of mutual assistance and cooperation. At the same time, in carrying out the movement to make mutual assistance a common practice, the Party organizations in Gansu adopted the method of large-scale mass movements. When there are difficulties, hand them over to the masses for discussion and mobilize the masses to solve them. Furthermore, in advocating and cultivating the lofty style of communist collaboration, the Party and administrative organizations at all levels have done a lot of specific organizational work. The province has province-wide industrial and agricultural-commercial cooperation meetings and material adjustment meetings, and special districts, counties, communes, and various systems and departments also have regular cooperation meetings. At all levels of cooperation meetings, they all take the abstract as the basis and give prominence to politics.

    全国一盘棋　全省一条心  困难留给自己　方便让给别人
    行行协作  环环挂钩
    甘肃条条战线互相帮助成为普遍风尚
    本报讯　甘肃省各个战线上普遍出现了互相帮助、互相支援的共产主义协作风气，给全省大规模、高速度地进行社会主义建设，创造了雄厚的物质力量。
    互助成风的特点是：规模大、风格高，工农商学兵之间都展开了不怕困难、不讲条件、不计报酬的大协作。人们的口号是：“全国一盘棋，全省一条心，困难留自己，方便让别人，缺啥给啥帮到底，互助成风齐跃进。”工业、基建系统，从原材料、机械设备、人力技术、图纸设计等各方面互通有无、互相帮助、互相促进。今年夏秋之间，各厂矿基建单位之间互相支援的材料就有钢材三千余吨、机器设备八百多台（件）、水泥一千五百多吨。有十六个单位急需的关键设备得到了解决。刘家峡水电工程局、建筑工程部第三工程局、兰州铁路管理局、引洮上山工程局和白银市，经常抽出一批劳力、机械，自带工具、干粮、供给，互相帮助突击重点工程。今年先后完成了盐锅峡黄河截流、洮河截流，高速度地建成了兰州铝厂。兰州铝厂的建设，比我国同样规模的铝厂的建设工期缩短了一半，工程成本降低了三分之二。盐锅峡截流时，二十多个单位支援机械和人力，各地派来援助的技工，比盐锅峡工程处的全部技工多一倍以上，从而保证了在三十六小时内斩断了黄河激流。正在进行对口对手竞赛的各厂矿，赛中有帮，一帮到底。兰州玻璃厂和兰州搪瓷热水瓶厂在对口赛中，后者设备不够，炉温不高。玻璃厂派自己厂里富有烧炉经验的车间主任和四个技术工人，带着自己的熔化炉去支援对方。帮助操作了一星期，并在操作中传授技术，解决问题，直到对方赶上自己的水平为止。
    今年，工业支援农业的计划一再提高。原计划制造各种农业机械五千五百三十二吨，但到10月底就完成了七千八百吨，现在已扩大到一万零四百多吨。而且都在农事季节前提早做好，运送下乡。在7月和11月，先后两次派了两千七百多名技术工人，组成农村服务大队，深入各个公社，帮助安装修配、传授技术和巩固社办工厂。仅7月间一次就帮助修配农具四十六万多件。许多没有担负支援农业任务的专业企业，也主动利用下脚料、边料、节余材料，制造农业机械支援农村。五一机器厂为农村专门设了八个门市部。省电力工业局出人出料帮助农村建立了十三个电厂、一百多座水电站，培养了四百三十三个公社电力工人，支援农村逐步实现电气化。
    农业对工业和城市的支援无微不至，要啥给啥。全省的粮食和农副产品、畜产品的年度收购计划，在农民支援工业保证建设的口号下，都已提前完成。据天水专区十个月统计，全区今年给工业提供的野生纤维、野生淀粉、野生油料和野生化工材料等原料，比去年同期增加了十倍多。夏收时届，基本建设和轻工业缺少竹竿、竹篾，有的厂子停工待料。消息传到陇南后，各人民公社立即在百忙中抽人抢伐竹竿，赶运兰州。
    各专区、县市、公社之间协作兴修水利和进行各种大规模建设的事例，更是到处皆是。临夏回族自治州六个民族，出动数万大军，帮助东乡族人民修成了一百四十多公里长的上山大渠——南阳渠，帮助海拔两千五百米以上的“旱”东乡，摘下干旱的帽子。
    商业部门职工，在只有保证生产，才能保证供应的思想指导下，都以厂为家，帮助工厂找寻原料、改进规格质量，扩大产品销路。今年以来，给工业找到了二百一十三种新原料，价值九十八万元。
    全省大中学校师生和身经百战的子弟兵们，在勤俭办校和保卫、支援社会主义建设中，经常地无酬地支援工农业生产。空军某部派飞机帮助抢运设备加速兰州铝厂的建设，某部工兵帮助地方修建了一座永登钢铁厂。学校在夏收、秋收农忙中，都放农忙假帮助抢收。
    互助成风，加速了全省的社会主义建设。全省今年的基本建设计划和兰州市各厂矿的生产计划，都已提前四十一天超额完成。“三秋”胜利结束以后，全省二百六十多万名劳动大军，立即大兴水利。现已新修水地二百六十一万亩，整修水地四百九十万亩，不到两月就扩大灌溉面积七百五十多万亩。商业在开展供销一条龙，交通在一网五化、路矿协作的互助成风的形势下，都出现了新的高涨。
    共产主义的互助风气的普遍形成，是中共甘肃省委一年多来向人民坚持进行共产主义和社会主义思想教育的结果。党在各种会议上表扬了白银市交通管理局和定西专区交通管理局无条件地支援石油工业部敦煌运输公司汽车轮胎、材料的共产主义风格。在进行正面教育的同时，党还坚持了同互助协作相对立的本位主义思想进行斗争。同时，在开展互助成风的运动中，甘肃地区党的组织采取了大手大脚大搞群众运动的办法。有困难交给群众讨论，发动群众解决。再就是在提倡和培养共产主义协作的崇高风尚中，党和各级行政组织，作了许多具体组织工作。省有全省性的工农商协作会议，物资调剂会议，专区、县、公社和各系统各部门，也都有定期的协作会议。在各级协作会议上，都以虚带实，政治挂帅。
