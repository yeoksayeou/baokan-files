　　Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Performance Competition Achieves New Development at the Northern Repair Plant
    Advanced Experience Packaged, Incorporated into Regulations Promptly
    All Workers in the Plant Participate, Assembling More Than Two Thousand Sets of Advanced Technical Experience in One Month
    (Our Dispatch) Anshan Iron and Steel's Northern Repair Plant workers, in the process of learning and promoting the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Third Steel Plant's technical performance competition, developed the technical performance competition into an "Advanced Technical Experience 'Packaging' Performance Competition." In one month, the entire plant assembled two thousand and sixty-four sets of advanced technical experience.
    In past socialist competitions, the plant's workers had created tens of thousands of valuable experiences. However, because they were not well collected and recorded, many valuable experiences
  were not well promoted. Often, after advanced experience emerged, individuals would record it in their minds or in personal notebooks. Some were forgotten over time, or the experience disappeared when the person left. This time, in the joint technical performance competition, the plant's Party committee raised it to the Party's agenda, made a special study, and proposed not to let any bit of advanced experience slip away, collect it, package it into complete advanced experience, incorporate it into operating methods and process regulations, and turn it into the common wealth of the masses.
    This plant adopted two methods in the packaging of advanced technical experience: one is called "horizontal packaging" or single-item packaging, which is to match different advanced experiences created by workers in the same process to produce the same product; the other is called "sequential packaging" or multi-item packaging, which is to match different advanced experiences created by workers in multiple processes to produce the same product. This consolidated technological innovation and enriched the content of the socialist competition.
    In order to clarify the direction, clarify the requirements, and strengthen organizational leadership, the plant's Party committee secretary, plant director, and other leading cadres all went to the front line of production. In addition to adopting the "three-combination" method, they also put forward the call for "three grasps," "four matchings," and "five simultaneities." The so-called three grasps are: grasp fixed products, grasp key problems, and grasp complete sets of products; the four matchings are: match past experience with current experience, match experience within the plant with experience outside the plant, match large experience with small experience, and match "native" experience with "foreign" experience; the five simultaneities are: simultaneous airing of views, simultaneous debate, simultaneous experimentation, simultaneous formulation, and simultaneous implementation. After successful experimentation, operating regulations and process regulations are formulated and immediately implemented, thereby significantly improving production efficiency. Generally, efficiency is increased by five to ten times, and some have increased by more than a hundred times. For example, Zhang Jiuying, a milling worker in the first processing workshop, in processing 58,800 "inclined shims" for the Dong Anshan Iron Mine, converted a broken press into a semi-native, semi-foreign "punch," which completed the two processes of cutting and drilling in one go, increasing production efficiency by 129 times and completing more than two years' worth of work in five days!
    The extensive development of advanced technical experience packaging has changed the phenomenon of relying solely on a few technicians to manage technology, and implemented everyone's participation in technology management. The plant's products are very complex, and a set of process regulations must be formulated for each type of product processed. The most arduous work for dozens of technicians is to sit in the office year after year and engage in "processes." As a result, some urgently needed spare parts cannot be completed on schedule because the "process" cannot be rushed out; sometimes the processes drawn up are also impracticable and are rejected by the workers; even some "processes" have not yet been drawn up, and the workers have already finished the work. After the technical experience is packaged, the scattered and piecemeal experience is packaged into sets, and a practical and feasible technical operating regulation and process regulation archive is established. In the future, when encountering the same type of product, there is no need to newly compile operating methods and process regulations. Workers can work according to a complete set of advanced technical experience.

　　鞍钢技术表演赛在北部机修厂有了新发展
    先进经验配套  及时纳入规程
    全厂职工一齐动手一个月配成二千多套先进技术经验
    本报讯　鞍钢北部机修厂职工，在学习推广鞍钢第三炼钢厂技术表演赛经验的过程中，把技术表演赛发展成为“先进技术经验‘配套’表演赛”。一个月来，全厂配成了二千零六十四套先进技术经验。
    这个厂过去在历次社会主义竞赛中，群众曾创造了成千上万条宝贵经验，然而由于没有很好搜集、记载下来，许多宝贵经验
  没有得到很好推广。往往先进经验出现后，个人记在脑子里或记
  在私人笔记本上，有的日久就忘掉了，或者是人走经验飞。这次联合技术表演竞赛中，厂党委就把它提到党的议事日程上来，作了专门研究，提出不让点滴先进经验跑掉，搜集起来搭配成完整的先进经验，纳入操作方法和工艺规程，变成群众共同的财富。
    这个厂在先进技术经验配套中采取了两种办法：一种叫“横配”或叫单项配，就是把工人在同一工序制作同一产品中所创造出来的不同先进经验互相搭配起来；另一种叫“顺配”或叫多项配，就是把工人们在多道工序制作同一产品中所创造出来的不同先进经验互相搭配起来。从而巩固了技术革新和丰富了社会主义竞赛的内容。
    为了明确方向，明确要求，加强组织领导，这个厂党委书记、厂长等领导干部都亲临生产第一线，除采用“三结合”的方法外，并提出了“三抓”、“四配”、“五边”的号召。所谓三抓：即是抓固定产品、抓关键问题、抓成套产品；四配是：过去的经验和现在的经验搭配、厂内经验和厂外经验搭配、大经验和小经验搭配、“土”经验和“洋”经验搭配；五边是：边鸣放、边辩论、边试验、边制定、边贯彻。试验成功后，就制定出操作规程和工艺规程，立即贯彻执行，从而使生产效率显著提高。一般的提高效率五至十倍，有的提高达百倍以上。如第一加工车间铣工张久盈，在加工东鞍山铁矿的五万八千八百个“斜垫”中，用一台破压力机改成一台半土半洋的“冲压器”，一回就完成了切割、钻眼两道工序，提高生产效率一百二十九倍，五天完成了二年多的工作量！
    先进技术经验配套的广泛开展，改变了只依靠少数技术人员管理技术的现象，实行人人参加技术管理。这个厂的产品十分复杂，每加工一种产品，就得制订一套工艺规程。几十名技术人员最繁重的工作，就是成年累月地坐在办公室里搞“工艺”。这样，有些急需备品，就因赶制不出“工艺”，而不能按期完成任务；有时划出来的工艺也实行不通，被工人顶了回来；甚至有的“工艺”还没有划出来，工人早已把活干完了。经过技术经验配套，把分散、零星的经验配成套，并建立了切实可行的技术操作规程和工艺规程档案，以后再遇到同类型产品，就不用再新编制操作方法和工艺规程了，工人按着成套的先进技术经验就可以干了。
