Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 13th: The Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party opened here on the 12th. This meeting will focus on discussing and resolving the issue of accelerating the development of agriculture, particularly animal husbandry.

    The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the German Democratic Republic, Hans Reichelt, spoke at the opening session on the development of animal husbandry. He said that at present, the cultivated land area of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide accounts for 43.5% of the total cultivated land area of the German Democratic Republic. Including the cultivated land area of state-owned farms, the cultivated land area of socialist components accounts for 52% of the country's total cultivated land area. In the German Democratic Republic, there are more than 1,100 villages where 80% of the cultivated land has been collectivized.

    Reichelt said that since the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party in July 1958, agricultural production cooperatives have occupied a decisive position in increasing agricultural commodity production. Therefore, in agriculture, exceeding the seven-year plan targets requires further adoption of the policy of socialist transformation of agriculture and increased commodity production.

    Reichelt focused on the tasks and measures to accelerate the increase of pork and milk production. He said that it is currently required to reach the number of cows stipulated in the seven-year plan for 1965 by 1963. Targets for other livestock and crop yields should also be overfulfilled. This requires raising various heifers for breeding and milking, improving cow rearing, and ensuring the feed base. The main potential for planting feed lies in expanding the planting area of ​​maize feed and increasing the yield per unit area of ​​maize. When talking about increasing meat production, Reichelt pointed out that the fattening period of pigs should be reduced to seven to eight months.

    Reichelt then said that in 1960, the target for poultry breeding in 1961 should be completed. By 1960, there should be at least 28 million laying hens, and by 1965, there should be 32 million. In terms of fish production in rivers and lakes, the target set for 1965 will be reached in 1964 or even earlier.

    Reichelt finally emphasized that the key to successfully completing these tasks lies in carrying out the movement of "Socialist Labor Teams" and "Socialist Labor Collectives." The application of scientific and technological knowledge should also be taken as one's own direction. He said that the participation of individual farmers in large-scale socialist production will create prerequisites for better application of scientific knowledge and the use of modern technology.

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 13th: In order to welcome the convening of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, the nationwide rural areas of the German Democratic Republic launched a mass movement to increase commodity production of livestock products such as meat and milk, and to strive to complete the main agricultural production targets stipulated in the seven-year plan two years ahead of schedule.

    This movement was launched after discussing an open letter published by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, at the end of November. The letter pointed out that the current agricultural production of the German Democratic Republic, especially livestock production, cannot yet better meet the growing needs of residents. He called in the letter for strengthening mass political work, organizing socialist labor teams and developing socialist labor collectives in agriculture, tapping potential, so that the commodity output of livestock products per hectare of land exceeds that of West Germany, and making the agricultural production of the German Democratic Republic reach world standards.

    In the process of discussing the open letter, agricultural workers across the country studied how to overfulfill this year's commodity production plan, and set out measures to complete the main agricultural production targets in the 1965 plan in 1963. Some advanced units, such as two milking teams in the Pinnnow state-owned farm near Berlin, have already drawn up plans to exceed the seven-year plan targets in terms of average milk yield per hectare of land and annual milk production per cow in 1962. The "New Life" agricultural production cooperative in Neubrandenburg has formulated measures to achieve the seven-year plan targets in terms of the number of dairy cows per unit area and milk production by 1963. In this mass movement, all localities paid special attention to strengthening political work and summarizing and promoting advanced breeding methods and expanding the experience of feed sources. For example, the Rennersdorf state-owned farm in Potsdam adopted advanced feeding methods, which increased the milk production of cows from 3,570 kilograms per year to 3,800 kilograms. They provided the state with 30,000 kilograms more milk.

    Some advanced state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives across the country also solved the difficulties caused by drought and insufficient feed through mutual adjustment and mutual assistance. Agricultural workers and cooperative farmers in many regions, under the slogan of "maximum savings and highest labor productivity," formulate plans on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis, making full use of feed and striving to complete and overfulfill this year's national livestock product commodity production plan.

    德国统一社会党举行第七次中央全会
    加速发展农业大力提高畜产品产量
    开展群众运动争取五年完成七年计划农业生产主要指标
    新华社柏林13日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第七次全体会议12日在这里开幕。这次会议将着重讨论和解决农业特别是畜牧业加速发展的问题。
    德意志民主共和国农林部长汉斯·赖希尔特在开幕会上就发展畜牧业的问题讲了话。他说，目前，全国农业生产合作社的耕地面积已占德意志民主共和国耕地总面积的43.5％。把国营农场耕地面积计算在内，社会主义成分的耕地面积已占全国耕地总面积的52％。在德意志民主共和国，有一千一百多个乡里，有80％的耕地已经合作化。
    赖希尔特说，自从1958年7月，德国统一社会党第五次代表大会以后，农业生产合作社在提高农业商品生产方面已占有决定性的地位。因此，在农业方面，超额完成七年计划指标，要求进一步采取农业社会主义改造和增加商品生产的方针。
    赖希尔特着重谈到了加速增加猪肉和牛奶产量的任务和措施。他说，目前要求在1963年达到七年计划规定的在1965年达到的母牛的头数。其它牲畜和农作物产量方面的指标也要超计划完成。这要求饲养各种供繁殖和挤乳的小母牛、改善母牛饲养和保证饲料基地。在种植饲料方面的主要潜力，在于扩大玉蜀黍饲料的种植面积和增加玉蜀黍的单位面积产量。赖希尔特在谈到增加肉类产量时指出，应当把猪的育肥期减少到七个月到八个月。
    赖希尔特接着说，在1960年，要完成1961年的家禽繁殖的指标。到1960年，供生蛋的母鸡至少要达到两千八百万只，到1965年应达到三千二百万只。在江和湖的鱼产方面，规定在1965年达到的指标将在1964年或更早一些的时候达到。
    赖希尔特最后着重指出，胜利完成这些任务的关键在于开展“社会主义劳动队”和“社会主义劳动集体”的运动。而运用科学技术知识也应作为自己的方向。他说，个体农民参加大规模的社会主义生产，将为更好地适用科学知识和利用现代技术创造先决条件。
    据新华社柏林13日电　为了迎接德国统一社会党第七次中央全会的召开，德意志民主共和国全国农村开展了一个提高肉类、牛奶等畜产品的商品生产和争取提前两年完成七年计划中规定的农业生产主要指标的群众性运动。
    这一运动是在讨论德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在11月底发表的一封公开信后展开的。信中指出，当前德意志民主共和国的农业生产，特别是畜牧业生产还不能更多地满足居民日益增长需要。他在信中要求加强群众政治工作、在农业中组织社会主义劳动队和发展社会主义劳动集体，挖掘潜力，使每公顷土地的畜产品的商品产量超过西德，并使德意志民主共和国的农业生产达到世界水平。
    全国农业工作者在讨论公开信的过程中，研究了如何超额完成今年的商品生产计划，并且纷纷定出在1963年完成1965年计划中的农业生产主要指标的措施。一些先进单位，像柏林附近的平诺夫国营农场中有两个挤奶队已经订出计划，要在1962年，在每公顷土地平均牛奶产量和奶牛的年产奶量方面，超过七年计划指标。纽勃兰登堡专区的“新生活”农业生产合作社，已经订出到1963年在单位面积奶牛头数和牛奶产量上实现七年计划指标的措施。在这一群众运动中，各地特别注意加强政治工作和总结推广先进饲养方法、扩大饲料来源的经验。例如，波茨坦专区伦内斯多夫国营农场采用了先进的饲养方法，使奶牛的产奶量从每年的三千五百七十公斤增加到三千八百公斤。他们向国家多提供了三万公斤牛奶。
    全国还有一些先进国营农场、农业生产合作社通过互相调剂、互相帮助的办法，解决旱灾带来的饲料不足的困难。许多地区的农业工人、合作社农民都在“最大限度节约和最高劳动生产率”口号下，按月、按旬、按日订出计划，充分利用饲料，为完成和超额完成今年国家畜产品商品生产计划而奋斗。
