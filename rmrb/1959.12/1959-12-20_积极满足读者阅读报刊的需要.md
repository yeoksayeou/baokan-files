    Actively Meet Readers' Needs for Reading Newspapers and Periodicals
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    Newspapers and periodicals are the most important spiritual food in people's lives. They are a powerful weapon for the Party to conduct socialist and communist education among the broad masses of people, and to encourage the people to accelerate socialist construction. They are a powerful tool for the broad masses of people to exchange experiences, promote each other, and improve together. Actively meeting readers' needs for reading newspapers and periodicals, and delivering newspapers and magazines accurately and quickly to readers, is an important task for postal and telecommunications workers.

    In recent years, the distribution of newspapers and periodicals has greatly improved; especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, the postal and telecommunications departments have implemented the principle of "taking newspaper distribution as the key link in postal communications," and the progress of distribution work has been even more significant. Not only have many systems been reformed, procedures simplified, and subscription made easier for readers, resulting in a significant increase in the number of newspapers and periodicals distributed; but also the speed of delivery has been greatly accelerated. Now, 50% of central-level newspapers arrive in the provinces on the same day, 69.1% of provincial newspapers arrive in the counties on the same day, and more than 80% of county newspapers arrive in the communes on the same day. Many production brigades and production teams can also see the county, provincial, and even central-level newspapers on the same day. The leap forward in newspaper and periodical distribution has been deeply praised by the broad masses of readers. As newspaper editors, we must also express our respect to our fraternal postal and telecommunications workers who are constantly striving for the Party's propaganda work on the distribution front. However, we must also see that the demands of the broad masses of people for reading newspapers and periodicals are constantly growing. With the improvement of people's political consciousness, more and more people will inevitably hope to learn about the domestic and international situation and the Party's policies and principles from newspapers and periodicals; with the deepening of the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, more and more people will inevitably hope to learn various advanced experiences from newspapers; with the development of the literacy campaign, more and more people will inevitably become newspaper and periodical subscribers for the first time. We must recognize this inevitable trend of development, constantly improve newspaper and periodical distribution work, and actively meet the needs of the broad masses of readers for reading newspapers and periodicals.

    Doing a good job in newspaper and periodical distribution, like doing other work, the key lies in putting politics in command, resolutely relying on the leadership of Party committees at all levels, relying on the assistance of the broad masses of society, continuing to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, and giving full play to the enthusiasm of distribution workers. There are many kinds of newspapers and periodicals. To distribute these different newspapers and periodicals to different readers, actively meet the needs of readers, and give full play to the actual effect of each newspaper and periodical, there is a lot to learn. Here, the most important links are doing a good job in investigation and research, publicity, subscription, dispatch, and delivery. Investigation and research, accurately understanding the different needs of various reader groups, is the premise for actively meeting readers' needs. Without investigation and research, without understanding what readers need and how much they need, there is no way to talk about "actively meeting readers' needs." However, investigation and research work must be combined with correct publicity and evaluation of newspapers and periodicals, because not every reader is very clear about the content and characteristics of each newspaper and periodical, and therefore can decide on their own preferences. Newspaper and periodical distribution personnel have the responsibility to publicize the content and characteristics of various different newspapers and periodicals, and help readers find newspapers and periodicals that suit their respective needs. As for the importance of subscription and delivery work, this goes without saying. Unreasonable subscription systems and complicated procedures will make readers "feel troublesome." Even if they need to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals, they are unwilling to come to inquire. Slow delivery and frequent errors will cause losses to readers and prevent the Party's newspapers and periodicals from playing their propaganda role in a timely manner.

    Doing a good job in investigation and research, publicity, subscription, dispatch, and delivery requires soaring enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm, without going to investigate and research, without going to publicize, without going to improve subscription and delivery work, and sitting at home "waiting for customers to come to the door," it is fundamentally impossible to meet readers' needs for reading newspapers and periodicals. Since the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of newspaper and periodical distribution personnel have exerted sufficient energy and created many successful experiences in doing a good job in investigation and research, publicity, subscription, dispatch, and delivery, and actively meeting the needs of readers. At the recently held National Newspaper and Periodical Distribution Work Conference, these advanced experiences were widely exchanged, and the representatives attending the meeting also put forward proposals to newspaper and periodical distribution workers across the country, requesting that newspaper and periodical distribution work be done better. We believe that in the new year, newspaper and periodical distribution work will definitely be done better, and more readers will definitely be able to read the newspapers and periodicals they need in a shorter time.

    积极满足读者阅读报刊的需要
    本报评论员
    报刊是人民生活中最重要的精神食粮。它是党向广大人民群众进行社会主义和共产主义教育，鼓舞人民群众加快社会主义建设的强大的武器，是广大人民群众交流经验、互相促进、共同提高的有力的工具。积极满足读者阅读报刊的需要，把报纸杂志准确迅速地送到读者手里，是邮电职工的一项重要任务。
    这些年来，报刊发行工作是有很大的改善的；特别是去年大跃进以来，邮电部门贯彻执行了“邮政通信以报纸发行为纲”的方针，发行工作的进步更为显著。不仅改革了许多制度，简化了手续，便利了读者订阅，因而报刊发行的数量有了很大的增加；而且传递的速度也大大加快了，现在中央级报纸当天到省的已达50％，省报当天到县的已达69.1％，县报当天到公社的已达80％以上。许多生产大队和生产队，也能看到当天的县报、省报甚至中央级报纸了。报刊发行工作的跃进，深受广大读者的称道。作为报纸编辑人员，我们更要向站在发行岗位上为党的宣传工作不断努力的兄弟般的邮电职工表示敬意。但是，我们还必须看到，广大人民群众阅读报刊的要求是不断增长的，随着人们政治觉悟的提高，必然会有更多的人希望从报刊上了解国内外的形势和党的方针政策；随着增产节约群众运动的深入，必然会有更多的人希望从报纸上学习各种各样的先进经验；随着扫盲运动的发展，也必然会有更多的人第一次成为报刊的订户。我们必须认识到这种发展的必然趋势，不断地改善报刊发行工作，积极满足广大读者阅读报刊的需要。
    做好报刊发行工作，也同做好其他工作一样，关键在于政治挂帅，坚决依靠各级党委的领导，依靠广大社会群众的协助，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，充分发挥发行工作人员的积极性。报刊的种类也很多，要把这些不同的报刊发行到不同的读者手上，积极满足读者的需要，使每一份报刊都充分发挥它的实际效果，是有很多学问的。这里，最重要的环节是做好调查研究和宣传、收订、发运、投递工作。调查研究，确切地了解各类读者对象的不同需要，是积极满足读者需要的前提。没有调查研究，不了解读者需要什么、需要多少，就谈不到“积极满足读者需要”。但是调查研究工作又要同对报刊的正确的宣传评介工作结合起来进行，因为并不是每一个读者都十分清楚地了解每一种报刊的内容和特色，因而能自己决定取舍的。报刊发行人员有责任来宣传各种不同报刊的内容和特色，帮助读者物色适合各自需要的报刊。至于收订和投递工作的重要性，这是不用多说的。收订的制度不合理、手续繁多，会使读者“嫌麻烦”，明明需要订阅报刊，也不愿上门问津。投递迟缓，经常发生差错，更会使读者受到损失，使党的报刊不能及时发挥它的宣传作用。
    做好调查研究和宣传、收订、发运、投递工作，都需要有冲天的干劲。没有干劲，不去调查研究，不去宣传，不去改善收订和投递工作，坐在家里“等客上门”，是根本不可能满足读者阅读报刊的需要的。大跃进以来，广大报刊发行人员鼓足干劲，在做好调查研究和宣传、收订、发运、投递工作，积极满足读者需要方面，已经创造了许多成功的经验。最近召开的全国报刊发行工作会议上，广泛交流了这些先进经验，到会代表并向全国报刊发行工作人员提出倡议，要求把报刊发行工作做得更好。我们相信：在新的一年中报刊发行工作一定能做得更好，一定能有更多的读者在更短的时间内读到他们需要的报刊。
