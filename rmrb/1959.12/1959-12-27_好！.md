Good!

What materials are buildings constructed from? Steel, cement, wood, sand, and gravel... This has been the old rule for many years. Now, Harbin has developed the technology of building "four without" buildings from last year and has built a building without steel, cement, wood, or red bricks. This building does not even use cast iron or wood for indoor radiators, doors, and windows. The old rules have been broken.

It is good to break this old rule, and there are three benefits:

First, the earth-shaking socialist construction requires more and more buildings, and therefore more and more building materials. And China is a large country with a large population, and to meet the housing needs of urban and rural people, we must build more public buildings and residences in the future. The situation that building materials cannot meet the needs cannot be resolved immediately. The completion of the new technology building in Harbin has opened up a broad new path for finding more building materials.

Second, using furnace ash and slag as building materials is a very promising thing. Furnace ash is everywhere; now is an era of ubiquitous small blast furnaces, and slag is also everywhere. In the past, people regarded it as waste, and it often took a lot of manpower and material resources to remove it. Now, this inexhaustible waste has become a valuable building material.

Third, the designers and builders of the new technology building have a high style of daring to think and act. Before the new technology building was built, and even during the construction process, many people said that this was impossible. Now, the building is there, and those who said it was impossible are speechless in the face of the facts.

We praise the birth of this new building because it not only shines with the brilliance of new technology but also with the brilliance of a new style of daring to think and act.

　　好！
    楼房是用什么材料建造的？钢筋、水泥、木材、沙石料……这是多年来的老规矩。现在，哈尔滨市发展了去年建筑“四不用”大楼的技术，又建成了一座不用钢材、水泥、木材、红砖的大楼；这座建筑，连室内的暖气片、门窗也不用铸铁和木材。老规矩打破了。
    这条老规矩打破得好，好处有三：
    一好，翻天覆地的社会主义建设事业，需要兴建的建筑物越来越多，建筑材料就需要得越多。而我国又是一个人口众多的大国，要满足城乡人民居住的需要，今后还得建更多的公共建筑和住宅。建筑材料不能满足需要的情况，不是一下可以解决得了的。哈尔滨新技术大楼的建成，就为寻找更多的建筑材料开辟了一条广阔的新道路。
    二好，用炉灰渣、矿渣作建筑材料，这是一件大有可为的事情。炉灰，到处都有；现在是小高炉林立的时代，矿渣也比比皆是。过去，人们把它当成废物，清除起来，往往要用很多人力和物力。现在，这种取之不尽的废物，成了宝贵的建筑材料了。
    三好，是新技术楼的设计者建设者敢想敢干的风格高。在新技术楼修建以前，甚至在施工过程中，许多人都说这是不可能的事。现在，楼房摆在那里，说不可能的人，在事实面前哑口无言了。
    我们歌颂这座新楼的诞生，因为它不仅闪耀着新技术的光辉，而且也闪耀着敢想敢干的新风格的光辉。
