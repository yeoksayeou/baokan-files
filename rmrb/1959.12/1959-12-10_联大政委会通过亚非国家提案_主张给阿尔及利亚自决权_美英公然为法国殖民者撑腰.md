Xinhua News Agency, December 8th dispatch: New York—The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the Algerian question on the 7th. The meeting, with thirty-eight votes in favor, twenty-six votes against, and seventeen abstentions, adopted the proposal on this issue put forward by twenty-two Asian and African countries.

The proposal of the twenty-two Asian and African nations "expresses deep concern over the continued hostilities within Algeria," advocates "recognition of the Algerian people's right to self-determination," and demands that "the parties concerned begin negotiations to determine the necessary conditions for the rapid implementation of the Algerian people's right to self-determination, including a ceasefire."

When the vote was taken, the socialist countries, including the Soviet Union, the twenty-two Asian-African proposing countries, and other nations voted in favor of the Asian-African proposal.

The delegations of colonial countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, and other countries opposed this proposal.

France did not participate in the vote.

During the committee's discussion, representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries publicly opposed the committee passing any resolution on the Algerian issue, saying that this would create "difficulties" for resolving the issue.

On the 7th, before the vote, representatives of various countries continued to speak. At the morning session, Saudi Arabian representative Shukairy accused the United States and the United Kingdom of supporting De Gaulle at the United Nations. Shukairy pointed out that he did not intend to study the records of discussions on all colonial issues since the founding of the United Nations to see where the Western countries stood and where the Soviet Union stood. Shukairy said, but "who is good and who is bad is very clear. The Western countries have always defended colonialism, while the Soviet Union has always stood on the side of the liberation movements. The Algerian issue is a prominent example."

    联大政委会通过亚非国家提案
    主张给阿尔及利亚自决权
    美英公然为法国殖民者撑腰
    据新华社8日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会7日结束了关于阿尔及利亚问题的讨论，会议以三十八票赞成，二十六票反对和十七票弃权，通过了亚非二十二个国家关于这个问题的提案。
    亚非二十二国提案“对阿尔及利亚境内继续进行敌对行动表示深切忧虑”，主张“承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利”，并且要求“有关双方开始谈判，以决定尽快实行阿尔及利亚人民的自决权、包括停火的必要条件”。
    表决时赞成亚非国家提案的有苏联等社会主义国家、亚非二十二个提案国和其他国家。
    反对这一提案的代表团是美英等殖民国家和其他国家。
    法国没有参加投票。
    美国、英国等国家的代表在委员会讨论过程中，曾经公开反对委员会就阿尔及利亚问题通过任何决议，他们说这样会给问题的解决造成“困难”。
    7日，在表决之前，各国代表继续发言，在上午会议上发言的沙特阿拉伯代表舒凯里指责美国和英国在联合国支持戴高乐。舒凯里指出，他不打算研究从联合国成立以来对所有殖民问题的讨论记录，以看看西方国家站在什么立场，而苏联又站在什么立场。舒凯里说，但是“谁好谁坏是很明显的，西方国家一直为殖民主义辩护，而苏联一直站在解放运动的一边。阿尔及利亚问题就是一个突出的例子。”
