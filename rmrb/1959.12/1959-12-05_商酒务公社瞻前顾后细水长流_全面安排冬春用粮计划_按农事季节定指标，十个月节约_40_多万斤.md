Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 4th: The CCP Henan Provincial Committee of Xuchang Prefecture recently held an on-site meeting in Shangjiuwu People's Commune, Baofeng County, to summarize and promote the commune's experience in planned grain consumption, economical grain use, and comprehensive arrangements for commune members' lives this winter and next spring.

	Shangjiuwu Commune is an advanced unit in Henan Province for planned grain consumption and economical grain use, having attended the National Congress of Heroes. They began implementing planned grain consumption and economical grain use in February of this year. By adhering to putting politics in command, strengthening the Party's leadership, and continuously educating commune members to plan ahead, live frugally, and live rich days as if they were poor, based on the principles of eating dry food during busy times, eating semi-dry/semi-liquid food during idle times, refining coarse grains, and combining staple and non-staple foods, they launched a vigorous mass movement. Under these principles, all canteens and commune member families established monthly plans for economical grain use, planning every day and arranging every meal. At the same time, the canteens actively carried out cooking technology innovations, promoted advanced methods for making steamed buns, actively developed non-staple food production centered on vegetables, and established vegetable bases and tofu, sauce, and vinegar workshops. Recently, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the commune formulated a grain consumption plan from now until the next wheat harvest by calculating grain rations and checking canteen inventories. They divided November to February of next year into a slightly busy period, March to May of next year into a moderately busy period, and June into a very busy period, and stipulated the grain consumption targets for each period. The brigades allocated the commune members' grain rations to the canteens at once, and the canteens, according to the principle of "fixed grain ration per person, distributed to households, eating in the canteen, and saving for oneself," calculated and distributed the monthly grain ration per person before the wheat harvest, issuing "Household Grain Collection Certificates," with commune members exchanging the certificates for grain coupons from the canteen each month, controlling their own rations, and saving for themselves. Each canteen also arranged a five-day menu according to the monthly grain consumption plan, with commune members posting daily pre-orders, and cooks planning and measuring rice for cooking. This ensured that there was both thin and thick gruel every day, and the meals were diverse, so that the commune members ate their fill and ate well. Since February of this year, the commune has saved a total of 468,000 jin of grain, which has been welcomed by the vast number of commune members. (Attached picture)

    商酒务公社瞻前顾后细水长流
    全面安排冬春用粮计划
    按农事季节定指标，十个月节约40多万斤
    新华社郑州4日电　中共河南省许昌地委最近在宝丰县商酒务人民公社召开现场会议，总结和推广这个公社计划用粮、节约用粮，全面安排今冬明春社员生活的经验。
    商酒务公社是河南省出席全国群英会的计划用粮、节约用粮的先进单位。他们从今年2月就开始实行计划用粮和节约用粮。由于坚持了政治挂帅，加强了党的领导，不断向社员进行瞻前顾后、细水长流、富日子当穷日子过的教育，本着忙时吃干、闲时吃半干半稀、粗粮细吃、主副食并举的原则，大搞群众运动。在上述原则下，全社食堂和社员家庭都订出了节约用粮的月计划，并且每天打算、每顿安排。与此同时，各食堂还积极进行炊事技术革新，推广了先进做馍法，积极发展以蔬菜为中心的副食品生产，建立了蔬菜基地和豆腐、酱、醋作坊等。最近，这个公社又根据党的八届八中全会决议和省委指示的精神，通过算口粮账、查食堂家底，订出了从现在起到明年麦收以前的吃粮规划。他们把11月到明年2月划为小忙时期，明年3月到5月为中忙时期，6月为大忙时期，并分别规定了各个时期的吃粮指标。大队把社员的口粮一次拨给食堂，食堂按照“口粮依人定量，分配到户，食堂吃饭，节约归己”的原则，把麦收前每月的口粮计算分配到人，发给“分户领粮证”，社员按月向食堂换取粮票，自己掌握，节约归己。每个食堂还根据当月吃粮规划，每五天安排一次饭菜单，社员每天挂牌预报，炊事员有计划地量米做饭。这样，就保证了每天有稀有干，饭菜多样，社员吃的饱，吃的好。从今年2月份以来，全社共节约粮食四十六万八千多斤，受到广大社员的欢迎。（附图片）
