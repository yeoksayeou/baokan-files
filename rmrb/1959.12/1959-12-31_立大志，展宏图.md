　　Aspire to Greatness, Unfold a Grand Vision
　　Wu Chuanqi
    To establish the great ambition of continuous revolution and to unfold the grand vision of transforming the world is the objective requirement of our leaping era and also the great communist style that is vigorously developing among the Chinese people under the education of Comrade Mao Zedong.
    "Heroes vow to reach the clouds, not ceasing until the Yellow River is tamed!" This is the great ambition of our people to resolutely tame the Yellow River. Following the great victory of the Sanmenxia damming project on the Yellow River in 1958, the closure of the Weishan Sluice project in Shandong Province, which cuts off the Yellow River, was also successfully completed this year. For thousands of years, this river, which has been difficult to tame, will thus be gradually subdued by the people and turned into a "giant dragon" at their command. Isn't the myth of Yu the Great taming the floods like stars vying with the sun when compared to the miracles we create today?
    As for the Yangtze River? When the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built in 1956, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "Sails stir, the Tortoise and Snake are still, a grand vision unfolds. With a bridge spanning the river, the natural barrier between north and south becomes a thoroughfare." Not long after, following the successful completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in 1957, the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge has also been completed; the third Yangtze River Bridge will soon begin construction. For the heroic people of our time, the fantastic myths of transforming great rivers and seas can gradually be turned into beautiful realities.
    This communist style of setting great ambitions and unfolding grand visions has gradually developed into a national style since 1958. Leaping forward again and again, a year better than the last, wave after wave, each wave higher than the last, is precisely the great trend of our leaping era moving forward. In the vast countryside, the vigorous mass movement of harnessing mountains, rivers, and land, which began in the winter of 1957, has entered a new climax this year. For example, after the mass movement in various parts of Hubei Province, the speed of agricultural capital construction has been continuously accelerated through large-scale collaboration and major tool reforms. Many rivers, wastelands, and hills have changed their appearance in a few days or dozens of days. Yingshan County and Anlu County in Hubei Province each reclaimed more acres of wasteland in more than a month than the original cultivated land in the two counties. "To make rivers obey our commands, to turn poor mountains into rich mountains, to turn barren land into fertile land" - this grand vision of the Chinese people to transform the world is becoming a great driving force for the Great Leap Forward with the high level of their subjective initiative and the increasing promotion of their heroic style.
    The vigorous development of this great communist style among the broad masses of working people since 1958 signifies that the Chinese people have been liberated economically, politically, and ideologically under the leadership of the Communist Party. Adapting to the objective requirements of the leaping advancement of our country's revolution and construction, Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, timely put forward the great call to promote the communist style. To set great ambitions, unfold grand visions, and be the masters of nature, the masters of culture, science, and technology. For thousands of years, the burden on the spirit of the working people caused by feudal oppression and a century of imperialist oppression, such as superstition, inferiority, disbelief in their own strength, and that repressed mental state, can be said to have been swept away by the soaring enthusiasm of the working people.
    Style is the expression of the spirit of the times, and philosophy is the reflection of the spirit of the times. We are in a leaping era of liberation from the "kingdom of necessity" to the "kingdom of freedom," "the mind of this liberation is philosophy, and its heart is the proletariat" (Marx). Since the world is developing, society is developing, and the times are developing, since Marxist philosophy is a philosophy that guides practice and transforms the world; then, accompanying the leaping development of the people's mass struggle to transform the world, as a philosophy that reflects the spirit of the times, as a style that expresses the spirit of the times, it is of course also developing. This national great communist style that expresses the spirit of our times is unprecedented. Its vigorous development shows that we are experiencing a great era of leaping development in the history of our country. Anyone must have a sufficient assessment of this great new situation. In all our revolutionary and construction undertakings, whether or not we dare to set great ambitions and whether or not we dare to unfold grand visions depends on whether he has a sufficient understanding of the leadership of the Party and the strength of the masses, and depends on whether he has a sufficient assessment of the current developing new situation.
    If a person lacks a sufficient understanding of the current great new situation, if he still superstitiously feels inferior, cannot see his own strength, and dares not think or act, then how can he have any great ambitions or grand visions? Some people have a kind of superstition, they dare not think of things that foreigners have not seen, they dare not do things that "the ancients have not seen before," and they dare not do things that are not recorded in books. If this is the case, how can their ambitions be great? How can their visions be grand? Therefore, to set great ambitions and unfold grand visions, we must continue to break down superstitions, liberate our minds, and correctly understand the current situation; break the slave mentality and establish the communist style.
    For the cause of socialist revolution and construction, those who view problems from the bourgeois standpoint will of course only hinder and not promote, let alone have any great ambitions or grand visions. They have no aspirations to build a strong country, but they are servile to all the old things of the bourgeoisie. They dare not rely on the masses and move forward like a broken bamboo, but are afraid of the masses and move forward with difficulty, worried all day long; they are afraid of revolutionary changes, fearing that changes will "disrupt" the old order, especially afraid of the enthusiasm of the people, fearing that this great revolutionary enthusiasm will destroy the old roots of private ownership. This state of mind is the opposite of the great style of our time, and is a reflection of the decadent feeling of the bourgeoisie on the verge of death, the so-called fin-de-siècle tragic mood.
    Some people have seriously declined in revolutionary will, lack lofty revolutionary ideals, and have no long-term goals. They do not "go all out and aim high," but practice the "doctrine of the mean" and willingly admit defeat. They have no great ambitions and no grand visions. Therefore, they are always procrastinating and encountering many difficulties in everything; this is not possible, that cannot be done, and they really have no ambition of a Marxist-Leninist. This is the worldview of a coward and a lazy person, which can be said to be thousands of miles away from the worldview of a true communist. If anyone is unwilling to lag behind the development of the times, he must completely abandon this worldview of cowards and lazy people.
    In the face of the great cause of socialism and communism, why are there such performances? The main reason is that the roots of individualism are at work. If a person adheres to the humble ambitions of individualism, he cannot have the great ambitions of socialism and communism; if he adheres to the trivial plans of individualism, he cannot have the grand undertakings of socialism and communism. If a person only has "small self-interest" in mind, only knows "worrying about himself," and only has the ambition of "for oneself and private," and has no plan of "for the country and the people"; such a person, if this "ambition" and this "plan" are not broken, how can his great ambitions and grand visions be established, and how can his style be elevated? Therefore, to establish the great ambitions and grand visions of communism, we must break the humble "ambitions" and trivial "plans" of individualism; we must completely abandon the ideological baggage of individualism and liberate ourselves from the heavy shackles of individualistic thinking. Without breaking individualistic thinking, one cannot control one's own destiny and be the master of one's own life.
    A person can take the ambition of 600 million people as his ambition, with a majestic momentum, and his ambition will be great; he can take the plan of 600 million people as his plan, with an irresistible force, and his plan will be grand. When a person can integrate his own personal interests with the interests of the great cause of communism, he will inevitably have unlimited confidence in the revolution, generate infinite power, and explode with soaring enthusiasm. Only by establishing the communist worldview and firmly believing in the leadership of the Party and the strength of the people can we have great ambitions and grand visions, dare to despise all difficulties, put forward advanced goals, and be fearless. In our great era of leaping development, our Party and our country need a large number of new people who dare to think and act.
    Under the education of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and under the light of the Party's general line, a large number of new people with this communist style have emerged since 1958. They dare to uphold the truth, break down superstitions, dare to set great ambitions and unfold grand visions, and establish advanced revolutionary banners. They have the noble qualities of selfless dedication, humble learning, and resourceful bravery. "Learn from the advanced, go to the difficulties, help the backward, and give way to the honors," this is the great style of the new people of our new era. The national Great Leap Forward since 1958 is not only a great leap in production, but also a great leap in thought; it is not only manifested in the great leap in socialist economic construction, but also in the great leap in communist ideological construction. In particular, this great leap in communist ideological construction, this vigorous development of communist style, is a century-long plan of "changing customs and habits," which has an immeasurable, huge, and far-reaching impact on the development of the leap forward situation in the future. To build a completely new society, we must cultivate completely new people; a great era has developed a great style - the communist style.
    This great development trend shows that our revolutionary and construction situation is getting better day by day, the enthusiasm of the people is getting higher day by day, and the communist style is being carried forward day by day. Today, following the Great Leap Forward of 1958, we have successfully gone through the leaping 1959. At the turn of the year, on all fronts of our production and construction, on the basis of completing this year's leap forward plan, we must recognize the great new situation, set great ambitions, make resolutions, unfold grand visions, boost our enthusiasm, further promote the communist style, and welcome the new leaping 1960.

### 立大志，展宏图

　　立大志，展宏图
　　吴传启
    立不断革命的雄心大志，展改造世界的宏图壮举，是我们这个跃进时代的客观要求，也是我国人民在毛泽东同志的教育下正在蓬勃发展着的伟大的共产主义风格。
    “英雄立下凌云志，不治黄河誓不休！”这是我国人民要坚决驯服黄河的雄心大志。继1958年黄河三门峡截流工程的伟大胜利，山东省腰斩黄河的位山枢纽合龙工程，又在今年胜利地完成了。千百年来，这条一直难以驯服的河流，就将这样地逐渐为人民所降伏，变成听人使唤的“巨龙”。大禹治水的神话，比起我们今天所创造出来的奇迹，不是宛如星星与太阳争辉吗？
    至于长江呢？1956年修建武汉长江大桥时，毛泽东同志曾经写道：“风樯动，龟蛇静，起宏图。一桥飞架，南北天堑变通途。”曾几何时，继1957年武汉长江大桥胜利建成以后，重庆的长江大桥又已建成了；第三座长江大桥不久也要动工了。对于我们时代的英雄人民来说，过去关于改造大江大海的幻想的神话，都可能逐步使之变为美丽的现实。
    这种立大志，展宏图的共产主义风格，从1958年以来，已经逐渐发展成为全民的风格了。跃进再跃进，一年胜一年，一浪接一浪，一浪高一浪，正是我们这个跃进时代向前发展的伟大趋势。在广大农村里，从1957年冬就开始的治山治水治土的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，今年又进入了一个新的高潮。如湖北省各地的群众运动起来以后，通过大协作和大搞工具改革，使农业基本建设的速度不断地加快了。许多河流、荒地、山丘，在几天、几十天之间就变了样子。湖北应山县和安陆县，在一个多月内各开荒地的亩数，比两县原有的耕地还多。“要江河听使唤，要穷山变富山，要薄田变良田”——我国人民群众这种改造世界的大志宏图，正在随着他们的主观能动性的高度发挥，他们的英雄风格的日益发扬而变为推动大跃进的伟大动力。
    这种伟大的共产主义风格，从1958年以来在广大劳动人民群众中的蓬勃发展，意味着我国人民在共产党领导下，已经从经济上、政治上和思想上获得了解放。适应我国革命和建设事业向前跃进的客观要求，我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志，及时地提出了发扬共产主义风格的伟大号召。立大志，展宏图，做自然界的主人翁，做文化、科学、技术的主人翁。几千年来，由于封建压迫和百年来帝国主义压迫在劳动人民精神上所造成的负担：如像那种迷信、自卑、不相信自己的力量，那种被压抑的精神状态，可以说是都被劳动人民的冲天干劲一扫而光了。
    风格是时代精神的表现，哲学是时代精神的反映。我们正处在从“必然王国”向“自由王国”解放的飞跃时代，“这个解放的头脑是哲学，其心脏是无产阶级”（马克思）。既然世界是发展的，社会是发展的，时代是发展的，既然马克思主义哲学是指导实践、改造世界的哲学；那末伴随着人民群众改造世界的实践斗争的飞跃发展，作为反映时代精神的哲学，作为表现时代精神的风格，当然也是发展的。表现我们时代精神的这种全民的伟大的共产主义风格，是史无前例的，它的蓬勃发展，说明了我们正经历着我国历史上伟大的飞跃发展的时代。任何人，对于这个伟大的新形势，必须有足够的估计。在我们的一切革命和建设事业中，敢不敢立大志，敢不敢展宏图，就看他对于党的领导和人民群众的力量是否有足够的认识，就看他对于当前这个发展着的新形势是否有足够的估计。
    如果一个人对当前这种伟大的新形势缺乏足够的认识，如果依然迷信自卑，看不见自己的力量，不敢想不敢干，又哪能有什么大志宏图可言？有的人有一种迷信，外国没见过的就不敢想，“前不见古人”的事就不敢干，书无记载的就不敢为，如此等等，则其志安能大？其图安能宏？因此要立大志，展宏图，就得继续不断地破除迷信，解放思想，正确认识当前的形势；破奴隶相，立共产主义风格。
    对于社会主义革命和建设事业来说，那些从资产阶级立场出发看问题的人们，当然是只会促退而不会促进的，更谈不上什么大志宏图了。他们对于国家的建设，无发奋图强之心；对于资产阶级的一切旧东西，却有奴颜婢膝之态。他们不敢依靠群众，势如破竹地一往直前，而是害怕群众，忧心忡忡地寸步难移；他们害怕革命的变革，怕变则“乱”了旧秩序，特别是害怕人民群众的干劲，怕这种伟大的革命干劲冲毁了私有制的老根。这种精神状态，是我们这个时代的伟大风格的反面，是一种资产阶级垂死之际的没落感，即所谓世纪末的悲哀情绪的反映。
    有一些人，革命意志严重衰退，缺乏崇高的革命理想，没有远大的奋斗目标。不是“鼓足干劲，力争上游”；而是“中庸之道”，甘拜下风。心无大志，胸无宏图。因而对于任何事情，总是拖拖沓沓，困难重重；这也不可能，那也办不到，真是半点马克思列宁主义者的雄心壮志都没有。这是一种懦夫和懒汉的世界观，同一个真正共产主义者的世界观，可说是相距十万八千里。如果谁不甘愿落后于时代的发展，就必须彻底抛弃这种懦夫和懒汉的世界观。
    在社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业面前，为什么会有这样一些表现呢？主要原因就是个人主义的根子在作怪。一个人如果坚持个人主义的卑下之志，就不能有社会主义、共产主义的雄心大志；如果坚持个人主义的微末之图，就不能有社会主义、共产主义的壮举宏图。如果一个人心目中只有“小己自私”，只知“忧己忧私”，只有“为己为私”之志，毫无“为国为民”之图；这样的人，此“志”此“图”不破，其大志宏图又怎能立得起来，其风格又怎能高得起来？所以要立共产主义的大志宏图，就必须大破个人主义的卑下之“志”，微末之“图”；就必须彻底抛弃个人主义的思想包袱，从个人主义思想的重重束缚下解放出来。不破除个人主义思想，就不能掌握自己的命运，做自己的生活的主人翁。
    一个人能够以六亿人民之志为志，气吞山河，其志才大；能够以六亿人民之图为图，势如破竹，其图才宏。当一个人能够把自己的个人利益同伟大的共产主义事业的利益融化为一体时，就必然对革命抱无限的信心，产生无穷的力量，爆发出冲天的干劲。只有树立共产主义的世界观，坚决相信党的领导和人民群众的力量，才能有大志宏图，才敢于藐视一切困难，提出先进的奋斗目标，无所畏惧。在我们这个伟大的飞跃发展的时代里，我们的党，我们的国家，需要大批这样敢想敢干的新人。
    在党和毛泽东同志的教育下，在党的总路线的照耀下，从1958年以来，不断涌现出了大批具有这种共产主义风格的新人。他们敢于坚持真理，破除迷信，敢于立大志、展宏图，树立先进的革命旗帜。他们具有大公无私、虚心学习和机智勇敢的高贵品质。“见先进就学，见困难就上，见落后就帮，见荣誉就让”，这就是我们这个新时代的新人的伟大风格。1958年以来的全民大跃进，既是生产大跃进，又是思想大跃进；既表现于社会主义经济建设的大跃进，又表现于共产主义思想建设的大跃进。特别是这种共产主义思想建设的大跃进，这种共产主义风格的蓬勃发展，更是“移风易俗”的百年大计，对今后跃进形势的发展，有着不可估量的巨大而深远的影响。建设全新的社会，必须培植全新的人；伟大的时代，发展了伟大的风格——共产主义风格。
    这种伟大的发展趋势表明，我们革命和建设的形势一天比一天好，人民群众的干劲一天比一天高，共产主义风格一天比一天发扬光大。今天，我们继1958年大跃进以后，又胜利地走过了跃进的1959年。际此岁尾年头，在我们的生产和建设的各个战线上，在完成今年跃进计划的基础上，必须认清伟大的新形势，立大志，下决心，展宏图，鼓干劲，进一步发扬共产主义风格，迎接新的跃进的1960年。
