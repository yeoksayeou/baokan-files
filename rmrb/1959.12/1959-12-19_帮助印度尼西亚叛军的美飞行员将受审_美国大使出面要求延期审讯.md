Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 10th: According to a report by the Indonesian National News Agency, Colonel Siswadi, the Director of the Air Force Intelligence Department, stated that the Indonesian Air Force Central Wartime Authority will transfer the captured American pilot, Pope, to the Jakarta Military Tribunal.

Pope was captured in May 1958. He aided the Indonesian rebel group, piloting aircraft to bomb eastern Indonesia, killing and wounding many Indonesians.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 15th: According to a report by the Indonesian National News Agency, the United States Ambassador to Indonesia, Howard P. Jones, representing the United States government, requested the Indonesian government several days ago to postpone the trial of American pilot Pope, who helped rebel groups bomb peaceful Indonesian residents. He stated that trying Pope at this time would be inappropriate.

The Indonesian National News Agency stated that the Jakarta Military Tribunal had decided to try Pope on December 28th. Pope has been in custody for over a year. Also currently detained are two other Americans with connections to the Indonesian rebel group: Frank Stretter and Hansley Broes. They were arrested in Kalimantan while illegally entering Indonesian territory. In mid-November, they both wrote to members of the visiting U.S. Senate delegation, stating that they came to Indonesia to negotiate surrender terms on behalf of the Indonesian rebel group.

"The Eastern Star" pointed out that the trial of Pope will further expose the desperate efforts of American imperialism to help the rebel group in Indonesia. Therefore, it is not surprising that the U.S. Ambassador is doing his utmost to request a postponement of Pope's trial. This is clearly to cover up American interference in Indonesia's internal affairs.

    帮助印度尼西亚叛军的美飞行员将受审
    美国大使出面要求延期审讯
    据新华社雅加达10日电　据印度尼西亚民族通讯社报道，空军情报处处长西斯瓦迪上校说，印度尼西亚空军中央战时掌权当局将把被俘的美国飞行员波普移交雅加达军事法庭。
    波普是在1958年5月被捕的。他帮助印度尼西亚叛乱集团，驾驶飞机到印度尼西亚东部地区进行轰炸，炸死和炸伤许多印度尼西亚人。
    据新华社雅加达15日电　据印度尼西亚民族通讯社报道，美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯几天前代表美国政府要求印度尼西亚政府延期审讯帮助叛乱集团轰炸印度尼西亚和平居民的美国飞行员波普。他说，在这个时候审讯波普是不相宜的。
    印度尼西亚民族通讯社说，雅加达军事法庭已经决定在12月28日审讯波普。波普被俘已一年多。现在被扣押的还有同印度尼西亚叛乱集团有关系的另外两个美国人。他们是弗兰克·斯塔尔和汉斯莱·布罗斯。他们两人是在加里曼丹偷入印度尼西亚境内时被捕的。他们两人在11月中旬写信给正在访问的美国参议院代表团的团员，说他们来印度尼西亚是为了代表印度尼西亚叛乱集团谈判投降的条件。
    “东星报”指出，对波普进行审讯将进一步揭露美帝国主义竭尽全力想帮助印度尼西亚的叛乱集团。因此，美国大使竭力要求延期审讯波普，这是不奇怪的。这显然是为了掩盖美国对印度尼西亚内政的干涉。
