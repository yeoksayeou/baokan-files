　　Reading Zhang Lei's "Old Tong and the Fruit Trees in Bloom"
　　Hou Jinjing
    The character sketch is a branch of reportage literature. Some novelists and essayists are now paying attention to this aspect and have written a lot. This is a good way for writers, especially novelists, to hone their observational skills of life, prepare materials for grand masterpieces, and practice writing regularly.
    Although character sketches do not necessarily bear the task of creating typical characters, and they cannot encompass deep mountains and vast swamps, only depicting a wave in the great current of life, they have their own strengths: swift, sharp, and timely. They can corroborate and complement political commentaries and essays, capturing a moment that resonates with the pulse of the times from a kaleidoscope of changing and complex life—either as a small interlude of victory in the advance of life, writing about new changes and developments in people, or as a javelin, piercing the decaying social forces and social thoughts, and as a broom, sweeping away the garbage that lies across the socialist road and emits mold.
    Comrade Zhang Lei, the author who once wrote the two long novels "Records of a Changing World" and "Annals of Mountains and Rivers," went to a commune in Huailai County, Hebei Province this year to participate in the Party committee's work. After a period of living there, he originally planned to start writing a long novel immediately, but the ever-changing changes in rural life and the waves of class struggle that rose and fell, these phenomena urged him on. Thus, before this year's National Day, he wrote a batch of character sketches, which were published in several publications.
    Among these pieces, the one that interests me most is "Old Tong and the Fruit Trees in Bloom" (published in "New Observer" No. 20, 1959). It vividly sketches a side view of an old wealthy middle peasant, writing about his great eruption of longing for capitalism and hatred for socialism when the commune is thriving. The work does not touch on his relationship with other peasants, his daily life and labor; the author only describes the moment when Old Tong's emotions boil over—the hateful, painful, and helpless psychological state expressed in the two scathing curses of the fruit trees.
    This description powerfully digs out the roots of a small number of wealthy peasants in the countryside who have spontaneous capitalist tendencies.
    When Old Tong's fruit trees were farmed individually, they did not develop well due to insufficient manpower, and only a few flowers like rusty egg yolks could bloom, so they could not bear much fruit. Later, after collectivization and communization, especially in the second year after the establishment of the commune, which is this year, the collective labor spent over the years bore fruit. The flowers in the orchard bloomed like a snow mountain, densely packed, so that the branches could not be seen. The flowers foretold a bumper harvest of fruits in the autumn of this year. Isn't this a great thing? But facing the sea of flowers like a snow mountain, different classes of people are aroused with different class feelings: those who support socialism are overjoyed, while those who oppose socialism, the lush flowers become thorns in their eyes, they are angry, disgusted, and uncomfortable. Old Tong, the old wealthy middle peasant, is one of them.
    In fact, the higher the degree of collectivization and the larger the scale of production organization, the more it hurts people like Old Tong, because the "hope" of restoration becomes smaller and smaller, to the point of becoming zero. This fruit tree problem is just a fuse. Old Tong, seeing that "his own" (already joined the commune) fruit trees are actually thriving along with the commune, he can't bear it. His hatred for socialism evokes his inseparable thoughts about capitalism, and all the feelings of infatuation with the old system, old traditions, and old habits suddenly surge up in his heart.
    One is cursing. "Damn it, you (referring to the fruit tree - note by the quoter, same below) are shameless. You've been with me for so many years, and you were reluctant to bear a single fruit. In the first year of communization, you bloomed so many flowers. Do you think the commune is good? Huh, shameless cheap thing! You're so cheap, the commune is good? Huh?..." It is truly the sound of gnashing teeth. But don't think that this time he has really broken with the fruit tree, and also with the feelings of the old system, and given up. No, on the contrary, he is not giving in so quickly. It is not so easy to eliminate his feelings of infatuation with capitalism. The feelings of this kind of person will not be so simple.
    Then the second is hatred. "Damn it, you still bloom so beautifully for them (the commune), afraid that they won't like you. At home (when farming individually), you broke branches and pulled on your load every year, but this year you have bloomed so many flowers. What's wrong with you? You don't like me, but I don't have you in my heart!" Here, his feelings are one layer deeper than cursing. He did not completely regard the deeply hated object as an already collectivized object. When he curses, he still firmly remembers that he was once the owner of the fruit tree. The actual private ownership of the fruit tree has been lost, but the concept of private ownership is still attached to the depths of his thoughts and feelings. He feels that he still seems to be the master of private property. This attitude, which we see as ridiculous and contemptible, is a truly "serious" and "sincere" feeling for some wealthy middle peasants like Old Tong. Therefore, he hates the fruit tree as if it were his unfaithful woman, which shows how deep his feelings for private ownership are. His exasperation shows that his old love for the fruit tree is difficult to cut off.
    However, the commune and the socialist system are as solid as a rock. For Old Tong, this is incomparably stronger than the strength of the wealthy middle peasants he represents. Therefore, Old Tong will also realize that the old system and old traditional habits in his heart are already precarious and unable to be maintained. Therefore, he feels more and more that the tragic end is coming. His third act, both crying and laughing, is a portrayal of this feeling. "Haha, I'm here to see you (fruit trees) again! We (Old Tong and the wealthy middle peasants of his type) have no ambition, who can we blame? You bloom so well, bloom so beautifully, ha! The commune treats you well, ha!" After Old Tong issued a hysterical laughter, what followed was a heavy sigh and curse: "You have failed me, they (the commune) have drained all my efforts, and you (fruit trees) are also taking advantage of my wishes." "Let me tell you, no matter how well you bloom, I won't envy you, let's just call it quits, you heartless bad things." The general trend is irresistible, but he is not willing to follow socialism wholeheartedly. The old roots of capitalism, deeply rooted in his heart, cannot be eradicated. When his emotions surge up, he erupts into a hysterical state of crying and laughing.
    Anyone with discerning eyes can understand that the reason why Old Tong scolds the trees is that on the one hand, he is reluctant to part with the old feelings, and cannot help but entrust his attachment to the old society to the fruit trees (which can no longer be entrusted); but more importantly, his subtext is to vent his uncontrollable hatred for the commune and the new society by scolding the fruit trees that grow more and more luxuriantly after communization.
    This kind of person, "his body in Cao Ying, his heart in Han," not only has the stubbornness to resist socialism, but also has a corrosive effect. This kind of person often builds air-raid shelters together with various anti-socialist social forces, releasing cold air and poisonous gas to the communization and the Great Leap Forward, affecting some wavering middle peasants and some wavering elements in society. When our work is advancing victoriously, they may temporarily express obedience, but they cannot be relied on once there is any disturbance. Old Tong's several scoldings are like a small, sinister cloud floating from the junction of the sea and the sky, which portends that a level-nine typhoon is about to come.
    The commune and the progressive members are united with this kind of people, and they have made appropriate arrangements for those who have some production experience and management ability, and some of them have even made them cadres of professional teams (such as orchard teams). The members also feel that this kind of old wealthy middle peasants who are close to the rich peasants are not well-intentioned towards the commune. Because their "one road" (capitalism) has been blocked by us, and their "two major programs" (from buying land to get rich to lending money, hiring workers, and climbing into the old society's ruling class by occupying government offices) have been dispelled by us. Their taking the socialist road is the storm of the times that has swept them over.
    Comrade Zhang Lei's sketch puts forward the roots of the wealthy peasants of Old Tong's type, reveals his emotions that were hidden in peacetime, and puts them on display under the bright sunshine for people to see, telling people to be more wary of this kind of people. This is very beneficial. The language he uses is concise and implicit, and his ridicule of Old Tong is full of bright and cheerful tones, which is inseparable from the author's full confidence in the commune's stride forward and his contempt for those monsters and demons.
    Character sketching is a short form in literature, but like Zhang Lei's article, it acts as a microscope, illuminating the mold hidden in Old Tong's heart, which develops and expands like yeast at a certain temperature, and is contagious among similar people. In this way, this sketch plays a role in improving the reader's understanding within the capacity it can reach. Moreover, it is not limited to this, because while illuminating the mold, it sings a bright and cheerful tune in the work, which is a blow to the molds (I think the author's writing about Old Tong's laughter is a bit excessive, weakening the seriousness of the work, so this blow is not very powerful), which is the combat significance produced by this sketch.

　　读张雷的“老同和果树开花”
　　侯金镜
    人物素描是报告文学的一个支流。现在有一些小说家、散文家注意到这方面，写了不少。这是作家，特别是小说家们锻炼观察生活的敏锐力，为宏篇巨制准备素材和经常练笔的好方法。
    人物素描固然不一定担负创造典型的任务，它不能容纳深山大泽，只描写生活巨流中的一朵浪花；但是它自有长处：迅速、犀利、及时，可以和政论、杂文互相印证，相辅相成，从万花筒一样多变又复杂的生活中抓住与时代脉搏相通的一刹那——或则做为生活前进中每一个胜利的小插曲，写出人的新变化和新发展；或则做投枪，刺向那衰朽的社会力量和社会思想，做为扫帚，扫除那横亘在社会主义道路上，并且散发霉菌的垃圾。
    曾经写出“变天记”、“山河志”两部长篇的作者张雷同志，今年他到河北省怀来县的一个公社参加党委会工作。经过一段生活以后，他本来打算马上着手写长篇的，但是农村生活日新月异的变化，阶级斗争一浪逐一浪、时起时伏地进行，这些现象催促着他，于是，在今年国庆节前，他写出了一批人物素描，发表在好几种刊物上。
    这些篇里最使我感到兴趣的是“老同和果树开花”（发表在“新观察”1959年第二十期上），它火辣辣地勾出一个老富裕中农的侧影，写他在公社欣欣向荣的时候，向往资本主义和仇恨社会主义感情的大爆发。关于他和别的农民的关系，他的日常生活劳动，作品里都没接触，作者只描写了老同感情沸腾起来的一刹那——对果树的两次痛骂中表现出来的仇恨、痛苦而又无可奈何的心理状态。
    这描写有力地挖出了农村中一小部分有自发资本主义倾向的富裕农民的根子。
    老同的果树在单干的时候，因为人手不够，发育不好，锈旦似的开不了几朵花，也就结不了什么果。后来合作化、公社化了，特别是到了公社建立了的第二年，也就是今年，几年来花费的集体劳动有了成果，果园里花开得像一座雪山，密密层层连树枝也看不见了，花预告了今年水果秋的时候将要得到大丰收。这不是大好的事情吗，但是面对着雪山一样的花海，不同阶层的人，所引起的是不同的阶级感情：拥护社会主义的人心花怒放，反对社会主义的人，茂盛的花变成了他们的眼中钉，他们气愤、讨厌、难受，老富裕中农老同就是其中的一个。
    其实，集体化程度越高，生产组织的规模越大，老同这种人的心里就越疼，因为复辟的“希望”越来越小，以至化成零了。这次果树问题不过是导火线儿，老同看着“自己”的（已经入了社的）果树居然跟公社一起欣欣向荣，他忍耐不住了，对社会主义的仇恨，勾起他对资本主义的难分难舍的思想，一切对旧制度、旧传统、旧习惯迷恋的感情，一下子在他心里全部翻腾起来了。
    一则是骂。“妈的，你（指果树——引用者注，下同）就不要脸，你跟我这么多年，一个果子也舍不得结。这公社化头一年，你就开了这么多花。你看着人家公社好？嗯，不要脸的贱玩艺！你可贱哩，公社好？嗯？……”真是切齿之声。可是不要以为他这一下真的就和果树、也就和旧制度的感情决裂了，死了心了。不，恰恰相反，他是不那么快就服输的，要使他那迷恋资本主义的感情消灭，也不那么容易，这种人的感情更不会那么单纯。
    于是二则以恨。“妈悻悻的，你还给人家（公社）开得展展的，只怕人家看不上你罗。在家里（单干）的时候，你年年破枝拉挂的，今年你可开了这么多的花。你咋啦你，你看不上我，我心里还没你呢！”这里，他的感情比破口大骂又深了一层，他把深恨着的对象，并没有完全当做已经集体化了的对象，在诟骂的时候，他仍然牢牢地记着他曾经是果树的所有者。果树的实际的私有权已经失去了，但是私有权观念仍然附着在他的思想感情的深处，他觉着，自己似乎仍旧是私有的主人。这种态度，我们看来是可笑的，可鄙的，而像老同这样的一部分富裕中农们，却是货真价实的“严肃”又“真挚”的感情。所以他把果树当做自己不忠实的女人一样地恨，正说明他对于私有制的感情之深，他的老羞成怒，正说明他和果树的旧情难以割舍。
    但是，公社和社会主义制度像磐石一样巩固，对老同来说，这是比他所代表的那一部分富裕中农们的力量要强大得不可比拟，所以老同也会意识到，旧制度、旧传统习惯在他的心里已经是风雨飘摇，无法维系得住，因而也就越来越感到悲剧的下场已经来临了。他的三则又哭又笑，正是这一感情的写照。“哈哈，我又来看你们（果树）来啦！咱（老同和他同一类型的富裕中农们）没志气嘛，怨人家谁？你们可开得好呵，开得展展的，呵！公社待你好呵！”老同在发了歇斯底里式的笑声以后，接着来的就是沉重的叹息和诅咒：“你可对不起我呀，他们（公社）把我的全份心血都熬干啦，你们（果树们）也来趁我的意。”“咱说吧，你开多好，我不艳羡，咱俩就算完了，你们没良心的坏东西”。大势所趋，无可奈何，可又并不甘心情愿死心塌地跟着社会主义走，深植在内心里的资本主义老根子又拔除不掉，感情翻腾起来，就发作成一股又哭又笑的歇斯底里的样子了。
    明眼人一看就懂，老同之所以骂树，一方面固然是因为旧情难舍，情不自禁，把对于旧社会的依恋寄托在（那已经无法寄托）果树上；但更重要的是他那弦外之音，骂公社化以后生长得越发茂盛的果树，正是借此来发泄对公社和新社会的抑制不住的仇恨。
    这种人，“身在曹营心在汉”，不但有抗拒社会主义的顽固性，而且也发生腐蚀作用。这种人常常和各种反社会主义的社会力量，共同筑成防空洞，对公社化、大跃进放冷气、放毒气，影响一些不坚定的中农和社会上的一些不坚定分子们。在我们的工作乘胜前进的时候，他们可能暂时表示服贴，而一有风吹草动，就靠不住了，老同的几次诟骂，正像从海天交界处飘来的一小块险恶的云朵，它预示着一场九级台风就要来了。
    公社以及进步的社员们对这种人是讲团结的，对他们这种有点生产经验和经营能力的人都做了适当的安排，其中有些人甚至让他们做了专业队（譬如果园队）的干部。社员们也感觉得到，这种挨了富农边的老富裕中农对公社不是善意的。因为他们的“一条道路”（资本主义），给我们堵死了，“两大纲领”（从买地发家到放债、雇工、占衙门爬进旧社会的当权派）被我们打消了。他们走社会主义道路是时代的风暴将他们卷过来的。
    张雷同志的这篇素描提出了老同这一类型的富裕农民的根子，把他在平时隐蔽着的感情给揭发出来，摆在光天化日下面展览给人们看，告诉人们对这种人要多存点戒心。这是很有益处的。他所用的语言简约含蓄，在对老同的嘲讽中充满着明朗欢快的调子，这和作者对公社的阔步前进充满信心，蔑视那些牛鬼蛇神的气魄是分不开的。
    人的素描是文学中的一种短小的形式，可是，像张雷的这一篇，它起了显微镜的作用，照出潜藏在老同心里的霉菌，在某一种温度下面，像酵母一样发展、膨胀，而且在同类人中间有传染性。这样，这篇素描就在它所能达到的容量之内对读者发生了提高认识的作用。而且，还不止于此，因为它在照出霉菌的同时，在作品里唱出明朗欢快的调子，就是对霉菌们的一种打击（我觉得作者对老同的笑声写得过分了些，削弱了作品的严肃性，因而这打击虽然还不是十分有力），这又是这篇素描所产生的战斗意义。
