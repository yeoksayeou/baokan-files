　　Western European Economy in the Last Two Years
　　Chen Zhaoxing
    The Economic Crisis of Last Year and the Economic Situation in the First Half of This Year
    Since the end of World War II, the Western European economy, generally speaking, before the outbreak of the economic crisis of overproduction that swept the capitalist world in 1957-1958, can be roughly divided into three periods: 1945-1951 was the period of Western European economic recovery; 1952 was the period when Western Europe entered an economic crisis; 1953-1955 was the period of Western European economic boom.

    In 1958, an economic crisis broke out in Western Europe. This crisis manifested itself in reduced industrial production, lower operating rates, increased unemployment, decreased orders, and sales difficulties. In that year, although the industrial production of the entire Western Europe still increased by 1.5% compared with 1957, the situation varied from country to country. Industrial production in the five countries of Britain, Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Luxembourg all declined; Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden stagnated at the 1957 level; the annual industrial production index of countries such as France, West Germany, and Italy continued to rise, but the rate of increase slowed down significantly. Moreover, local crises broke out in key sectors such as steel, coal, and textiles. In general, this crisis concentrated on hitting the steel, coal, textile, pulp, shipbuilding, and shipping sectors of all Western European countries. Among them, the industrial decline in the United Kingdom was widespread. During the crisis, the industrial sectors that experienced production cuts accounted for 83% of the total industrial output value of the United Kingdom. Industries with production cuts lasting for half a year and exceeding 10% accounted for one-third of the total industrial output value, making it the country with the widest range of production cuts and the largest reduction among the major Western European countries.

    Another manifestation of the crisis was the general decline in operating rates. In August 1958, the operating rate of the metal processing industry in the United Kingdom fell to 80%, and the general machinery manufacturing industry fell even further to 40%-90%. Before the crisis, the industrial operating rate in West Germany was almost 100%, but it fell to 88.5% in the third quarter of 1958. In Italy in 1958, the steel operating rate was only 78%, and the internal combustion engine manufacturing operating rate even fell to 30%-50%. France lacks complete statistics on the utilization of industrial equipment. In November 1958, eight out of ten French industries experienced insufficient operating capacity, while in the same period in 1957, only four out of ten experienced insufficient operating capacity. The phenomenon of insufficient operating capacity in small Western European countries was also very serious.

    The increase in unemployment was particularly significant. According to United Nations statistics, the average number of unemployed people in thirteen countries, including Britain, France, Italy, and West Germany, was 3.58 million in 1958, an increase of 9% compared with 1957.

    The difficulty in product sales was also quite common, especially in the coal industry. Although coal production in Western Europe was reduced in 1958, coal stocks were still piled up like mountains. The stock of hard coal in the six countries of the Coal and Steel Community and the United Kingdom was much larger than during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

    The reason for the Western European economic crisis in 1958 was that after a period of boom, the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private ownership system had further expanded in the Western European economy. For many years after the war, Western European monopoly capital, in order to pursue maximum profits and enhance competitiveness, plundered surplus value by suppressing wages and blindly expanded production. As a result, as Marx said: "The more productive forces develop, the more they contradict the narrow foundation on which consumption relations are based."① The market problem is difficult to solve, and the economic crisis of overproduction is bound to break out. The situation in Western Europe in 1958 was exactly like this. The scale of fixed capital investment that determines the production of the first category of products was 45 billion US dollars, an increase of only 1.3% compared with 1957, less than one-third of the growth rate in 1957 or one-eighth of the investment boom in 1955. Among them, the investment scale in countries such as Belgium and Finland actually declined. The level of domestic consumption that determines the production of the second category of products has also increased very little in recent years due to the deepening impoverishment of the working people, even if the increase in consumer credit is included. Domestic consumption expenditure in 1958 only maintained the 1957 level, and individual countries such as France even experienced a decrease. Western European exports, which originally had a relatively fast growth rate after the war, also decreased by 0.6% in 1958 due to the impact of the capitalist world economic crisis. The intertwining of shrinking domestic and foreign markets inevitably led to a crisis. However, the maturity of the crisis varies from country to country and from industry to industry. New industrial sectors such as oil, automobiles, and chemicals still have sales, so the conditions for a crisis have not fully matured. However, the conditions for a crisis have matured in many industries. For example, the steel industry stagnated in 1958 and the military production has gradually shifted from conventional weapons to missile production. The coal industry declined due to the reduction in coal consumption as steel production declined and oil gradually replaced industrial coal. The textile and pulp industry declined because of the economic downturn in the underdeveloped countries.

    In the first half of 1959, Western European countries experienced an increase in exports due to the recovery of the US economy and the steel strike; the military orders increased as the countries continued to pursue expansion plans; the sales of durable consumer goods were stimulated by the relaxation of consumer credit in individual countries (such as the United Kingdom); and the industrial production in Western Europe has gradually recovered due to the need to replenish inventories after a long period of production cuts. The industrial production index in Western Europe was 135 in the first quarter of this year (1953 = 100, same below), and 139 in the second quarter, an increase of one point and seven points respectively compared with the same period last year. The United Kingdom, Norway, Belgium, Finland, and other countries that were most severely hit by the crisis have also experienced varying degrees of recovery in industrial production, and the industrial production in the United Kingdom has exceeded the highest level before the crisis. However, from the perspective of specific sectors, except for the steel industry, which saw a significant recovery in steel exports and production due to the US strike②, the other sectors have not improved significantly. The coal industry and the shipping industry are still in a state of depression.

    Although the Economy Has Recovered Slightly, the Prospects are Still Bleak
    Although the Western European economy has recovered slightly, the prospects are still very bleak.

    First, the Western European economic boom has passed. In the future, due to the inability to solve the problem of excess production capacity, monopoly capital cannot greatly expand equipment investment, and therefore the economic development speed will slow down. Since the end of the basic stage of the Western European boom in 1956, the growth rate of fixed capital investment has declined year by year due to excess production capacity. The investment scale in 1958 increased by only 1.3% compared with 1957. The investment figures for 1959 have not yet been published. However, in the past ten years, the total amount of equipment investment in Western Europe has reached 157 billion US dollars, and the industrial equipment in Western European countries is more modern than in the past, and the production capacity is much larger than in the past. Taking West Germany, where investment has grown the fastest, as an example, 48% of the industrial machines used in West Germany in 1957 had been in use for less than five years, while only 18% in 1948. The newer the machine, the less likely it is to need to be updated urgently. In the case of excess equipment capacity, although Western European monopoly capital still has the possibility of continuing to invest in new products, new technologies, and sectors related to military production in order to pursue maximum profits, and despite the intensification of competition after the establishment of the "Common Market," some sectors may continue to expand, excess production capacity is, after all, a powerful restriction on expanding investment. In the recent period, fixed capital investment is unlikely to increase significantly, and the economic development speed will inevitably slow down. This fact cannot be denied even by the British bourgeois mouthpiece, the "Financial Times." The editorial of the newspaper on May 20, 1959, pointed out that the phenomenon of excess production capacity in Western Europe is still quite common, and the investment scale will not increase much in the future, and an economic boom is unlikely to occur.

    Second, the Western European economy will be more unstable in the future, and the economic crisis of overproduction will be more frequent. After the Western European industrial production recovered to the pre-war level in 1948, there was a textile crisis in 1951-1952, a paper industry crisis in 1952, a machine manufacturing crisis in 1952-1953, and a coal and steel crisis in 1953-1954. The local crises that broke out in individual countries are not included. It can be seen that the Western European economic crisis is frequent, one wave is not flat, and two waves are rising again. The 1958 crisis swept across the steel, coal, textile, pulp, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors at the same time, and the scope was the widest after the war. This proves that more and more key production sectors in Western Europe are experiencing market problems. It is only because sectors such as military industry, new products, and new technologies still have sales markets that a comprehensive decline in the economic crisis of overproduction has not broken out. However, the development of these sectors is limited and cannot continue to develop blindly forever without an economic crisis of overproduction. This can be explained by the automobile industry, which plays a considerable role in supporting the Western European economy. The automobile industry is one of the sectors that has developed rapidly in Western Europe after the war. The development of the automobile industry requires a large amount of steel, aluminum, copper, glass, rubber, and machine tools. The consumption of steel alone is more than 10 million tons per year, which plays a great stimulating role in the entire economy. During the Western European economic crisis last year, the export market for automobiles continued to expand due to the US demand for small cars, and the domestic market also continued to grow due to the adoption of installment payment methods. Western Europe produced 3.58 million cars and 880,000 commercial vehicles, an increase of 23% and 10.5% respectively compared with 1957, which eased the economic crisis in 1958. However, the expansion of the automobile industry is ultimately limited. When it is overproduced, it will cause a reduction in steel, non-ferrous metals, and rubber. This chain reaction is bound to deepen the difficulties of the entire economy, thereby causing a series of sectors to experience an economic crisis of overproduction. The automobile industry is like this, and so are other blindly expanding industrial sectors. Obviously, in the case that the basic contradiction has not been resolved and the economic development imbalance continues to deepen, Western Europe will more frequently break out economic crises of overproduction, and cyclical economic crises will eventually break out.

    Finally, the fiscal and financial situation of Western European countries is not good, and fiscal and financial crises, especially foreign exchange crises, may still break out. Except for very few countries, the vast majority are living on debt. After the outbreak of the economic crisis, countries have successively adopted measures such as increasing military spending, increasing investment in state-owned enterprises and public works, cutting taxes, and relaxing credit, which have worsened the fiscal and financial situation of all countries. For example, the national budget of West Germany in fiscal year 1958 had a deficit of 2.852 billion marks, and the deficit in fiscal year 1959 increased to 4.453 billion marks. The federal government's debt also increased from 19.7 billion marks at the end of 1957 to 21.4 billion marks at the end of 1958. France is even more difficult because of the colonial war in Algeria. The budget deficit in fiscal year 1956 was 180 billion francs, 488 billion francs in fiscal year 1957, and increased to 645 billion francs in fiscal year 1958. Government debt increased from 5,754.5 billion at the end of 1956 to 7040 billion francs at the end of 1958. The budgets of the United Kingdom in recent years have all had deficits. The budget deficit in fiscal year 1959 was 236 million pounds, and the government debt is often around 30 billion pounds. The national debt is as high as one and a half times the gross national product of the country in one year, which is more serious than the United States. During the crisis, the money supply in these countries also increased: from the end of 1957 to the end of 1958, West Germany increased by 13.4%, Italy increased by 6.3%, France increased by 6.4%, and the United Kingdom increased by 2.5%. Under the pressure of continuous increases in deficit budgets and money supply, prices continue to rise. The situation in France and Finland is particularly serious. In France alone, wholesale prices rose by 11.6% and retail prices rose by 15.2% in 1958.

    It is particularly noteworthy that the possibility of a foreign exchange crisis breaking out in many countries is particularly high. On the surface, the current gold and foreign exchange reserves of various countries have improved somewhat, and even the United Kingdom, which has experienced foreign exchange crises six times after the war, increased its gold and foreign exchange reserves in 1958 despite the decrease in exports due to the decline in raw material prices. However, the improvement in the foreign exchange situation caused by the decline in raw material prices is not solid. Although the British government has used the temporary improvement in the foreign exchange situation to restore the free exchange of the pound, this is a risky thing. Even the British "Economist" magazine worriedly pointed out that if raw material prices rise by 4% to 5%, the United Kingdom will have to pay an additional 200 million pounds in raw material imports each year, and the balance of payments will change from surplus to deficit. In addition, measures such as lowering the discount rate adopted to stimulate production may also cause foreign exchange to flow back to foreign countries. Therefore, the United Kingdom is also likely to experience a foreign exchange crisis again. If a fiscal and financial crisis breaks out in Western European countries, the ruling class will inevitably re-adopt measures such as raising the discount rate and restricting imports. In this way, production development will be more restricted, and the Western European economy, which has already recovered little and is unstable, will feel more difficult, and may accelerate the outbreak of the economic crisis of overproduction.

    Development of Domestic and International Contradictions in Western European Countries
    Because the production capacity of Western European countries is still surplus, the domestic investment market cannot be greatly expanded. As a result of the increase in unemployment, the reduction in wages, and the increase in the tax burden, the purchasing power of the working people has become even lower, and the domestic consumer market cannot be expanded. In addition, countries still pursue "embargo" policies to varying degrees, the raw material crisis suffered by underdeveloped countries has not yet passed, and the foreign market cannot have greater development. Therefore, domestic and international contradictions in various countries are sharper than before.

    Domestically, the contradiction between Western European monopoly capital and the working class is becoming increasingly acute. For more than ten years after the war, Western European monopoly capital has seized more and more monopoly profits by strengthening labor intensity and suppressing wages. Taking the wages of steel workers as an example, the hourly wages of Italian steel workers are only one-quarter of those in the United States. Although the wages of French and West German steel workers are slightly higher than those in Italy, they are only about three-tenths of the wages in the United States. On the other hand, monopoly profits are particularly high. According to a report in the British "Financial Times" on January 17, 1959, the profits of British monopoly capital did not even decrease in 1958. It is estimated that the profits of 3,326 large companies in the United Kingdom in 1958 were 2.85 billion pounds, an increase of 4.5% compared with 1957. The production of West Germany, France, and Italy increased somewhat in 1958. Due to the decline in raw material prices and the intensification of exploitation of workers, the manufacturing cost has been greatly reduced, and profits have increased even more.

    Recently, monopoly capital in various countries has been vigorously promoting automation and strengthening labor intensity to increase labor productivity, and the unemployment problem is serious. It is estimated that the United Kingdom now has an average number of employees from 1947-1949. Due to the increase in labor productivity, the manufacturing industry has increased by 44%, but the number of employees has decreased by 4%. West Germany and France have similar phenomena.

    In addition, in order to benefit the interests of monopoly capital, the governments of various countries have also adopted measures such as freezing wages, reducing social welfare expenditures, increasing taxes, and abolishing rent control, which directly attack the living standards of the working class, severely weakening the people's purchasing power, further deepening the impoverishment of the working people, and making the domestic market smaller.

    The attack of monopoly capital and its government on the working class has caused a resolute counterattack from the working class. The worker movement has reached a new upsurge, and strike struggles have been launched more widely. For example, the number of strikers in the United Kingdom in 1958 was 425,000, and 3.2 million working days were lost; while in the first nine months of this year alone, the number of strikers was 577,000, and 4.87 million working days were lost. Italy has a more turbulent strike wave because of the particularly low wages and the particularly large number of unemployed people. At present, 3 million people have participated in the strike struggle for rights and interests. At present, the awareness of the working class in Western European countries has been significantly improved, unified action has been further strengthened, and the joint struggle against international monopoly organizations has also had new developments.

    Internationally, new contradictions have arisen between Western Europe and the United States due to changes in the balance of power during the crisis. At the end of World War II, the United States' economic strength absolutely overwhelmed Western Europe. Even in 1948 when Western European production recovered to the pre-war level, the United States' industrial production was still twice that of Western Europe. However, because the United States' economic crisis broke out frequently after the war and the Western European economy has been developing faster, the United States' industrial production in 1956 was only one-third larger than that of Western Europe. This crisis had a greater impact on the United States than on Western Europe, so the United States' industrial production in 1958 was only about one-quarter more than that of Western Europe. The "dollar shortage" in Western European countries for many years has also been eased to a certain extent due to the increase in exports. In recent years, Western European cars, electrical equipment, and chemical products have been exported to the United States in large quantities. The balance of power between the two major industrial centers in the capitalist world has changed in favor of Western Europe. Western Europe's bargaining power when dealing with the United States has increased relatively, which has further intensified the struggle between Western Europe against US control and the United States continuing to control Western Europe. Recently, US monopoly capital is vigorously increasing its investment in Western Europe in order to intensify exploitation, attempting to obtain more profits and greater control from within Western Europe, and Western European countries have carried out strong resistance.

    The contradictions between Western European countries are also very large. Due to the deepening of the imbalance in the economic development of various countries, the balance of power between countries has also changed. When Western Europe entered the boom stage in 1953, the United Kingdom's industrial production was one-third larger than that of West Germany. However, between 1953 and 1958, the United Kingdom's industrial production increased by 14% while West Germany's increased by 52%. At present, West Germany's industrial production has exceeded that of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom and West Germany both mainly export electrical equipment, automobiles, machines, and chemicals, and the struggle between the two countries for market share is the most intense. The recent establishment of the two exclusive groups of the "Common Market" and the "Small Free Trade Area" is a concrete manifestation of the deepening contradictions between the two countries. Even within the same economic group, member states are also fighting each other due to different interests. The collusion between France and West Germany is also a temporary phenomenon, and more contradictions will inevitably arise in the future due to conflicts of interest. After the recent devaluation of the franc, the price of French steel is lower than that of West Germany, and West Germany is dissatisfied with this and has requested France to levy a 4% steel export tax. At present, the two exclusive groups are only in the initial stage of establishment and preparation, but they have already accused each other of disagreements. If tariffs and import quotas are truly implemented in the future, there will be more contradictions and struggles.

    This economic crisis has also deepened the contradictions between Western Europe and Latin America, Asia, and African colonies, as well as other underdeveloped countries. These are all raw material exporting regions. Raw material prices began to fall from the second half of 1956, and the decline was very large, and raw material exporting countries have suffered great losses. In 1958 alone, exports from Latin America, Asia, and African countries decreased by 1.5 billion US dollars as a result. However, Western Europe and other countries raise monopoly prices for industrial products, so raw material exporting countries suffer great losses due to unequal exchange. According to Comrade Varga's estimates, Western European countries received 1 billion US dollars in benefits from unequal exchange in 1958 alone.

    In short, after the economic crisis in 1958, the Western European economy has been weakened. Although it has gradually climbed out of the crisis to varying degrees and the economy has recovered and developed somewhat, the economic prospects of these countries are still extremely bleak in the future due to the sharp domestic and international contradictions. Under the conditions of the further deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, they are now completely unable to get rid of this predicament. Just like the United States, with the continuous crises and shocks, Western European countries will also rot day by day. This is the inevitable trend of capitalist economic and political development.

    ① "Capital", People's Publishing House, 1956 edition, Volume 3, p. 291.
    ② The United States imported 3.03 million tons of steel in the first three quarters of 1959, while only 1.7 million tons in the whole year of last year. Western Europe's steel industry has increased production more significantly in recent years due to the increase in steel exports.

　　两年来的西欧经济
　　陈兆兴
    去年的经济危机和今年上半年的经济情况
    第二次世界大战结束以来，西欧经济总的说来，在1957—1958年资本主义世界普遍地爆发生产过剩的经济危机以前，大致可分为三个时期：1945—1951年是西欧经济恢复时期；1952年是西欧进入经济危机时期；1953—1955年是西欧经济高涨时期。
    1958年，西欧爆发了经济危机。这次危机表现在工业减产，开工率降低，失业人数增加，订单减少和销售困难等方面。这年，整个西欧工业生产虽然仍比1957年增加了1.5％，但是，各国情况不尽相同。英国、比利时、芬兰、挪威和卢森堡五个国家工业生产都已下降；丹麦、荷兰和瑞典三国则停滞在1957年的水平上；法国、西德和意大利等国的年度工业生产总指数仍继续上升，但上升速度已大大减缓。而且在钢铁、煤炭、纺织等关键性部门也爆发了局部性危机。总的说来，这次危机集中打击了西欧所有国家的钢铁、煤炭、纺织、纸浆、造船、航运等部门。其中英国工业下降的部门很广，危机期内先后出现减产的工业部门占英国工业总产值的83％，减产持续半年而减产幅度在10％以上的行业也占工业总产值的三分之一，是西欧几个大国中减产面最广，减产幅度最大的一个国家。
    危机另一表现是开工率普遍降低。英国1958年8月金属加工工业开工率下降到80％，一般机器制造业更下降到40％—90％。西德工业开工率在危机前几乎是100％，但1958年第三季度下降到88.5％。意大利1958年钢铁开工率只有78％，内燃机制造业开工率甚至下降到30％—50％。法国工业设备利用程度缺乏比较完整的统计，1958年11月法国工业十分之八出现开工不足现象，而1957年同期开工不足者不过十分之四。西欧小国开工不足现象也很严重。
    失业人数增加尤为显著。根据联合国统计推算，1958年英国、法国、意大利、西德等十三个国家平均失业人数是三百五十八万人，比1957年增加9％。
    产品销售困难现象也相当普遍，煤炭业尤为突出。1958年西欧煤炭虽已减产，但存煤仍堆积如山，煤钢联营六国和英国硬煤结存量比三十年代大危机时还大得多。
    造成1958年西欧经济危机的原因是西欧经济经过高涨阶段后，生产社会性同私人占有制的矛盾已进一步扩大。西欧垄断资本战后多年来为着追求最大利润和增强竞争能力，通过压低工资的办法来掠夺剩余价值，并盲目扩大生产，结果就正如马克思所说：“生产力越是发展，它就越是与消费关系所借以建立的狭隘基础陷于矛盾”①。市场问题难以解决，生产过剩经济危机就必然爆发。西欧1958年的情况正是如此。决定第一部类产品的固定资本投资规模是四百五十亿美元，比1957年只增长1.3％，还不到1957年增长速度的三分之一或投资高涨的1955年时的八分之一。其中比利时和芬兰等国投资规模却绝对下降。而决定第二部类生产的国内消费水平，也由于劳动人民贫困化加深，即使把消费者信贷增加数计算在内，最近几年增长速度也微乎其微。1958年国内消费开支只维持在1957年水平，个别国家例如法国甚至还有减少现象。战后原来增长速度较快的西欧出口货物，1958年也因资本主义世界经济危机影响而减少0.6％。国内外市场萎缩交织在一起，必然要爆发危机。但各国和各工业部门的危机成熟程度并不一致。新工业部门如石油、汽车和化学等的产品仍有销路，因此危机条件还未完全成熟。但不少行业的危机条件却已成熟。例如钢铁工业因1958年投资规模基本上停滞在1957年水平和军事生产渐由常规武器转到导弹生产等原因，煤炭工业因钢铁减产而耗用煤炭量减少和石油逐渐代替工业用煤等原因，纺织和纸浆因世界经济危机爆发后经济不发达国家采购量减少等原因，先后爆发了生产过剩危机。
    1959年上半年，西欧国家因为美国经济回升和钢铁罢工而出口增加；各国继续奉行扩军计划而军事订货增加；个别国家（如英国）因放宽消费者信贷而刺激了耐用消费品的销路；以及减产历时较久后存货需要补充等原因，整个西欧的工业生产已逐渐回升。西欧今年第一季度工业生产指数是135（以1953年为100，下同），第二季度是139，比去年同期分别增加一点和七点。英国、挪威、比利时、芬兰等是受这次危机打击最重的国家，工业生产也有不同程度的回升，英国工业生产并已超过危机前最高水平。但是，从具体部门来看，除钢铁工业因美国罢工而使钢铁出口增加和生产有显著回升外②，其余各部门都无大起色。煤炭工业和航运业仍处于萧条状态。
    经济虽已回升前景仍暗淡
    西欧经济虽略有回升，但前景仍很暗淡。
    首先，西欧经济高涨阶段已过去。今后一段时期，由于生产能力过剩无法解决，垄断资本不可能大大扩充设备投资，因而经济发展速度将更趋缓慢。西欧自1956年高涨阶段基本结束后，固定资本投资规模增长速度因生产能力过剩已逐年下降。1958年投资规模只比1957年增加1.3％。1959年的投资数字还未发表。但是，最近十年来西欧设备投资总数已达一千五百七十亿美元，西欧各国的工业设备已比过去现代化，生产能力也比过去大得多。以投资增长最快的西德为例，1957年西德工业机器使用年份在五年以下者占48％，而1948年才占18％。机器越新则迫切需要更新的可能性越小。在设备能力过剩情况下，尽管西欧垄断资本为着追求最大利润，对新产品、新技术以及同军事生产有关的部门仍有继续投资可能，尽管“共同市场”成立后竞争加剧，某些部门还可能继续扩充，但生产能力过剩毕竟是扩充投资的一个有力限制。最近期间，固定资本投资难望有较大增长，经济发展速度必然放慢。这一事实，连英国资产阶级喉舌的“金融时报”也不能否认。该报1959年5月20日社论指出：现时西欧的生产能力过剩现象仍相当普遍，今后投资规模增长不大，不可能出现经济高涨。
    其次，西欧经济今后将更不稳定，生产过剩危机将更频繁。西欧工业生产自1948年恢复到战前水平后，曾在1951—1952年爆发纺织危机，1952年爆发纸业危机，1952—1953年爆发机器制造业危机，1953—1954年爆发煤钢危机。个别国家爆发的局部危机还未计算在内。可见西欧经济危机爆发频繁，一波未平，二波又起，1958年的危机更同时席卷钢铁、煤炭、纺织、纸浆、航运和造船等部门，范围为战后最广的，这证明现时西欧已有越来越多关键性生产部门的市场发生问题。只是由于军事工业、新产品和新技术等部门还有销售市场，全面下降的生产过剩危机还未爆发。但是这些部门的发展是有限度的，不可能永远盲目发展下去而不出现生产过剩危机。这点可用对支持西欧经济起着相当大的作用的汽车工业来说明。汽车工业是西欧战后发展较快的一个部门。发展汽车工业需要大批钢材、铝、铜、玻璃、橡胶和机器工具，仅钢材一项每年即耗用一千万吨以上，对整个经济起着很大的刺激作用。去年西欧经济危机时期，汽车的出口市场因美国需要小型汽车等原因而继续扩大，国内市场也因采用分期付款办法而续有增长。西欧生产小汽车三百五十八万辆，商业用汽车八十八万辆，比1957年分别增长23％和10.5％，因而缓和了1958年的经济危机。但汽车工业的扩充终究有限度，当它生产过剩时就会引起钢铁、有色金属、橡胶等减产，这一链锁反应势必加深整个经济的困难，从而使一系列部门发生生产过剩危机。汽车工业如此，其他盲目扩张的工业部门也是一样。显然，在基本矛盾没有解决，经济发展不平衡性继续加深的情况下，西欧将更频繁地爆发生产过剩的经济危机，周期性经济危机最后也将爆发。
    最后，西欧各国财政金融情况不良，财政金融危机特别是外汇危机仍可能爆发。除极个别国家外，绝大多数都是靠借债度日。这次经济危机爆发后，各国相继采用增加军事开支、增加国营事业和公共工程投资、削减税收、放宽信贷等措施，使各国财政金融情况都比前恶化。例如，西德的国家预算1958年度就出现赤字二十八亿五千二百万马克，1959年度赤字更增至四十四亿五千三百万马克。联邦政府的债务也从1957年底的一百九十七亿马克增加到1958年底的二百一十四亿马克。法国因为进行阿尔及利亚殖民战争，情况更困难。1956年度的预算赤字为一千八百亿法郎，1957年度为四千八百八十亿法郎，1958年度增到六千四百五十亿法郎。政府债务则从1956年底的五万七千五百四十五亿增加到1958年底的七万零四百亿法郎。英国最近几年的预算都出现赤字，1959年度预算赤字是二亿三千六百万英镑，政府债务经常在三百亿英镑左右，国债竟达全国一年国民生产毛值的一倍半，情况比美国更为严重。危机期间，这些国家的货币供应量也有增加：从1957年底到1958年底，西德增加13.4％，意大利增加6.3％，法国增加6.4％，英国增加2.5％。各国在赤字预算和货币供应量不断增加的压力下，物价仍继续上升。法国和芬兰情况特别严重，法国仅在1958年批发物价就上涨11.6％，零售物价上涨15.2％。
    特别值得注意的是：不少国家爆发外汇危机的可能性特别大。表面看来，现时各国黄金外汇储备都有些改善，甚至连战后已爆发外汇危机六次的英国，1958年在出口减少的情况下，由于原料价格下降，黄金外汇结存增加了。但因原料价格下跌而造成外汇情况的改善是不牢固的。英国政府虽利用了外汇情况暂时好转来恢复英镑自由兑换，但这是冒险的事。连英国“经济学家”杂志也忧心忡忡地指出，如果原料价格回升4％至5％，英国每年就得在原料进口方面多付出二亿镑，国际收支就会由盈余变为亏损。此外，因刺激生产采用的降低贴现率等措施，也可能使外汇重新流到外国。因而英国也很可能再度出现外汇危机。西欧各国如爆发财政金融危机，统治阶级势必重新采用提高贴现率和限制进口等措施，这样，生产发展将受到更多限制，原已回升不多、动荡不定的西欧经济将更感困难，并可能加速生产过剩危机的爆发。
    西欧国家国内外矛盾发展
    西欧国家因生产能力仍然过剩，国内投资市场不可能大大扩张。而失业人数增加、工资减低、租税负担加重的结果，劳动人民的购买力已更低落，国内消费市场也无法扩充。加以各国在不同程度上仍奉行“禁运”政策，经济不发达国家所受原料危机仍未过去，国外市场也不可能有较大发展。因此各国国内外矛盾比以前更加尖锐。
    国内方面，西欧垄断资本同工人阶级的矛盾日益剧烈。西欧垄断资本战后十多年来通过加强劳动强度和压低工资等措施，攫取了越来越多的垄断利润。以钢铁工人的工资为例，意大利钢铁工人每小时的工资只合美国的四分之一，法国和西德钢铁工人的工资虽比意大利稍高，但也只合美国工资的十分之三左右。另方面，垄断利润则特别高。根据英国“金融时报”1959年1月17日报道，英国垄断资本的利润甚至在1958年也没有降低。据估计，英国三千三百二十六家大公司1958年的利润是二十八亿五千万镑，比1957年增加4.5％，西德、法国、意大利等国1958年生产有些增长，因原料价格下降和加紧剥削工人等关系，制造成本大大降低，利润增长更多。
    各国垄断资本最近大搞自动化和加强劳动强度来提高劳动生产率，失业问题严重。据估计，英国现在同1947—1949年平均数比，由于劳动生产率提高，制造业虽增产44％，但就业人数却减少4％。西德和法国等也有类似现象。
    此外，各国政府为了垄断资本的利益，还纷纷采用冻结工资、削减社会福利开支、增加税收、取消房租管制等直接向工人阶级生活水平进攻的措施，严重削弱了人民的购买力，使劳动人民贫困化进一步加深，也使国内市场更加缩小。
    垄断资本及其政府对工人阶级的进攻已引起工人阶级的坚决回击。工人运动有了新高涨，罢工斗争更广泛展开了。例如英国1958年全年罢工人数是四十二万五千人，损失三百二十万个劳动日；而今年仅头九个月罢工参加人数是五十七万七千人，损失四百八十七万个劳动日。意大利因为工资特别低和失业人数特别多，罢工浪潮就更澎湃。现时有三百万人参加了争取权益的罢工斗争。目前西欧各国工人阶级觉悟已显著提高，统一行动已进一步加强，反对国际垄断组织的联合斗争也有新的发展。
    在国际方面，西欧同美国由于危机期内力量对比变化而产生出新的矛盾。第二次大战结束时美国经济实力绝对压倒西欧。甚至在1948年西欧生产恢复到战前水平时，美国工业生产仍两倍于西欧。但因战后美国经济危机爆发频繁而西欧经济发展速度一直较快，结果1956年美国工业生产只比西欧大三分之一。这次危机对美国的打击比西欧大，因而1958年美国工业生产大约比西欧只多四分之一。西欧多年来的“美元荒”也因出口增加而有一定程度的缓和。西欧国家近年的汽车、电工器材和化学产品已向美国大量出口。资本主义世界两大工业中心的力量对比已起了有利于西欧的变化。西欧跟美国打交道时的讨价能力已相对增加，这使西欧反对美国控制和美国继续控制西欧的斗争进一步加剧。最近美国垄断资本为加紧剥削，正在大力增加对西欧地区的投资，企图从西欧内部取得更多利润和更大的控制权，西欧国家进行了强力的抵抗。
    西欧各国间的矛盾也很大。由于各国经济发展不平衡性的加深，各国之间力量对比也起了变化。西欧在进入高涨阶段的1953年时，英国工业生产比西德大三分之一。但1953—1958年间，英国工业增产14％而西德增产52％，现时西德工业生产已超过英国。英国和西德出口都以电工器材、汽车、机器和化学品等为主，两国为争夺市场而展开的斗争就最激烈。最近“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”两个排他性集团的成立正是两国矛盾加深的一个具体表现。即使在同一经济集团里，各成员国之间因利益不同也勾心斗角。法国和西德的勾结也是暂时现象，将来因利益冲突必然产生更多矛盾。最近法郎贬值后。法国钢材价格比西德低廉，西德对此不满，曾要求法国征收4％的钢出口税。现时两个排他性集团还只在成立初期和筹组阶段，但彼此间已相互指责龃龉。将来关税和进口限额如果真正实施，矛盾和斗争就会更多。
    这次经济危机还加深了西欧同拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲殖民地以及其他地区不发达国家的矛盾。这些都是原料出口地区。原料价格自1956年下半年起开始下跌，下跌幅度很大，原料出口国家无不遭受很大损失。仅仅1958年，拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲国家出口因此就减少十五亿美元。而西欧等国出口工业品却提高垄断价格，故原料出口国由于不等价交换而受到很大损失。据瓦尔加同志估计，西欧国家1958年一年内因不等价交换得到十亿美元的好处。
    总之，经过1958年的经济危机，西欧经济已受到削弱，目前虽已不同程度地逐渐爬出了危机，经济有所恢复和发展，但是由于国内外矛盾仍很尖锐，今后这些国家的经济前景依旧极为暗淡。在资本主义总危机进一步加深的条件下，现在它们已完全无力摆脱这种困境了。正如美国一样，随着不断的危机和震荡，西欧国家也将会更加一天天烂下去，这是资本主义经济和政治发展的必然趋势。
