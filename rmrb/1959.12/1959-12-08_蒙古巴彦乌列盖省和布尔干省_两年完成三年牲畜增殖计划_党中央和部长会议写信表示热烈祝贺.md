Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, December 5th: Mongolia's Bayan-Ölgii Province and Bulgan Province completed the three-year plan (1958-1960) for increasing livestock ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment in two years. The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Council of Ministers recently issued a letter of congratulations, expressing warm congratulations.

　　Bayan-Ölgii Province increased its livestock by 73,000 head this year, overfulfilling this year's plan. The livestock increased by this province in the two years of last year and this year exceeded the target set by the three-year plan by 4%. Bulgan Province also successfully completed its livestock increase plan this year, and overfulfilled the three-year plan by 2.4% in two years.

　　The main reasons why these two provinces overfulfilled the task of increasing livestock are: in practical work, they implemented the resolution of the 13th National Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party on increasing livestock and the instructions of the Third Plenary Session. Herdsmen launched a socialist labor competition and did a good job in lambing, protecting livestock, and feeding.

　　In the congratulatory letter to these two provinces recently, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Council of Ministers requested the working herdsmen of the two provinces to further consolidate the achievements already made, continue to promote advanced experience in production, fully prepare for the wintering of livestock, and make greater achievements in the last year (1960) of the three-year plan.

    蒙古巴彦乌列盖省和布尔干省
    两年完成三年牲畜增殖计划
    党中央和部长会议写信表示热烈祝贺
    新华社乌兰巴托5日电  蒙古巴彦乌列盖省和布尔干省以两年时间提前和超额完成了三年计划（1958—1960年）增殖牲畜的任务，蒙古人民革命党中央委员会和部长会议最近发出贺信表示热烈祝贺。
    巴彦乌列盖省今年增殖牲畜七万三千头，超额完成今年计划。这个省在去年和今年两年间所增殖的牲畜，比三年计划所规定的指标超过4％。布尔干省今年也胜利完成了增殖牲畜的计划，并在两年内超额2.4％完成三年计划。
    这两个省超额完成增殖牲畜任务的主要原因是：在实际工作中，贯彻了蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会增殖牲畜的决议和三中全会的指示，牧民们掀起了社会主义劳动竞赛，做好接羔、保畜、饲养等工作。
    蒙古人民革命党中央和部长会议最近在给这两个省的贺信中，要求两省劳动牧民进一步巩固已经取得的成就，在生产中继续推行先进经验，充分作好牲畜过冬工作，在三年计划的最后一年（1960年）作出更大成就。
