Havana Dispatch: Prime Minister Castro, in a televised address "To the Press" on the evening of December 17, summarized the work of the Cuban revolutionary regime in its first year. He said that defending national sovereignty and carrying out land reform are the most important tasks undertaken by the Cuban government.

Castro said that the Cuban government has defended the fate of the nation, recovered land occupied by foreigners, and protected national industry. He stated that 1960 would be "the year of issuing land certificates." He emphasized that there would be no more unemployed people in the countryside next year, and that 1959 was the last year that Cuban farmers would go hungry.

Castro emphasized the significance of the Cuban government's unprecedented integrity and dedication to public service. He said that the revolution would enter its second year with great momentum, and that it was now better organized and its ranks were clearly defined. He emphasized that the masses supporting the revolution were numerous, resolute, and trustworthy.

The Prime Minister emphasized, "Much has been done in 1959, but even more will be done in 1960." He called for saving foreign exchange to purchase factories and industrial equipment.

Referring to the counter-revolutionary forces' attempts to rely on foreign powers to launch an armed attack against Cuba, Castro said, "No foreign army can occupy our territory." He said that every bomb that falls on Cuban soil will arouse protests from people of all countries and lead them to support Cuba.

On December 20, Prime Minister Castro, at the National Federation of Commercial Employees, condemned the criminal activities of the counter-revolutionaries and called on the masses to actively expose the rumors spread by them. He said that their slander should be countered in barber shops, stores, hotels, restaurants, streets, and everywhere. (Picture attached)

　　卡斯特罗总结古巴政府第一年工作
    保卫主权和土改是首要任务
    必须警惕国内外反革命分子的颠覆阴谋
    哈瓦那消息：卡斯特罗总理12月17日晚在“致报界”的电视演说中总结了古巴革命政权第一年的工作。他说，保卫国家主权和进行土地改革是古巴政府所做的最主要的工作。
    卡斯特罗说，古巴政府保卫了国家的命运，收回了外国人占有的土地，保护了民族工业。他说，1960年将是“颁发土地证的一年”。他强调说，明年在农村中不会再有失业人口了。1959年是古巴农民还吃不饱肚子的最后一年。
    卡斯特罗强调指出了古巴破天荒第一次建立的廉洁奉公的政府的重要意义。他说，革命将气势磅礴地进入第二年，革命已经组织得更好，营垒已经分明。他强调说，支持革命的群众是为数众多的、坚决的和可以信赖的。
    总理强调指出，“1959年做了很多事情，但是，1960年将做得更多。”他号召节约外汇来购买工厂及工业设备。
    卡斯特罗谈到反革命势力妄图依靠外国的力量来发动对古巴的武装进攻时说，“任何外国军队都占领不了我国的领土”。他说，每一个落在古巴土地上的炸弹，都将激起各国人民的抗议和起来支持古巴。
    12月20日，卡斯特罗总理在全国商业雇员联合会上谴责反革命分子的罪恶活动，并且号召群众积极揭穿反革命分子散布的谣言。他说，应该在理发店、商店、旅馆、饭馆、大街上，在一切地方反击他们的诽谤。（附图片）
