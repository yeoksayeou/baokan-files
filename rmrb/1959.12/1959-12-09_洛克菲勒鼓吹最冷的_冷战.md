Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, December 6th: Today's American "Worker's Weekly" published an article by Art Shields, exposing how American oil industry monopolist Rockefeller is doing his utmost to advocate for the "Cold War" in order to continue making a fortune from it.

The article said that the vast majority of the Rockefeller family's $3.5 billion personal fortune is in oil. A large portion of the more than $60 billion in corporate assets controlled by this most powerful American family is also in oil.

Rockefeller's opposition to peaceful coexistence with socialist countries is also for the sake of oil.

The article said that Rockefeller's oil companies profit from the Cold War in two ways. The first is by profiting from oil purchased by the Department of Defense. The second is the Rockefeller family's huge overseas oil investments, which are backed by military might.

Since the beginning of the Cold War, the Pentagon's oil purchases have been steadily increasing. In the 1959 fiscal year, its purchases increased to 290 million barrels of oil. This figure is twice the amount purchased by the Pentagon at the peak of the Korean War in 1952. Since Eisenhower took office, the U.S. government's annual spending on oil purchases has increased to more than $1 billion. The Pentagon's Military Petroleum Supply Agency purchased these 290 million barrels of oil for $1.15 billion in the 1959 fiscal year. Most of the profits went to Mobil Oil, controlled by Rockefeller. The article said that one can therefore understand why, when he cannot get a hot war, the Governor of New York hopes for the coldest Cold War.

### 洛克菲勒鼓吹最冷的“冷战”

     洛克菲勒鼓吹最冷的“冷战”
    据新华社日内瓦6日电　今天的美国“工人周报”发表了阿尔特·希耳德的一篇文章，揭露美国石油业垄断资本家、纽约州州长洛克菲勒竭力鼓吹“冷战”，为的是要继续靠“冷战”发财。
    文章说，洛克菲勒家族的三十五亿美元个人财产绝大部分是石油。这个美国最有势力的家族控制的六百多亿美元的公司资产，很大一部分也是石油。
    洛克菲勒反对同社会主义国家和平共处也是为了石油。
    文章说，洛克菲勒的石油公司在冷战中从两方面获取利润。第一是从国防部购买的石油中获取利润。第二是洛克菲勒家族对海外的巨大石油投资，这种投资是有军事后盾的。
    自从冷战开始以来，五角大楼的石油购买量一直在大大增加。在1959财政年度里，它的购买量已增加到二亿九千万桶石油。这个数字为五角大楼在1952年朝鲜战争最高峰时期购买量的两倍。自从艾森豪威尔上台以来，美国政府每年购买石油的支出已增加到十亿美元以上。五角大楼的军用石油供应局在1959财政年度里用十一亿五千万美元购买了这二亿九千万桶石油。大部分利润归洛克菲勒控制的美孚油公司所得。文章说，因此人们可以理解，为什么纽约州长在得不到热战时，希望有最冷的冷战。
