　　Night
　　Chen Juemin
　　Five-year-old Ju Ying, with her head resting on her grandmother's lap, had her clever eyes closed, but she wasn't asleep. The eyelashes on her eyelids trembled from time to time as she thought about her father and mother. Her father was a nationally renowned steelworker at the Satellite Furnace, and her mother was a trolley driver in the transportation department. Recently, to complete this year's production tasks ahead of schedule, her father and mother had been very busy. Look, it had been dark for a while, and they still hadn't returned.
　　The child knew her grandmother's temper well. If she wasn't closing her eyes and behaving while her older sister was teaching her grandmother to read, her grandmother would definitely get angry. Now, Ju Ying raised her little hand as a shield and secretly glanced at her grandmother and sister sitting cross-legged on the kang facing each other. In front of the grandmother was her sister's large slate, and in her sister's hands was her grandmother's literacy textbook. The sister recited softly, word by word, and the grandmother wrote with a determined effort, stroke by stroke:
　　"Learn culture and open your eyes,
　　These eyes are very useful,
　　Looking at the mountain can know the water in the mountain,
　　Looking at the water can control the dragon in the water."
　　"She's testing Grandma!" Ju Ying thought to herself. When her sister moved the slate with the words her grandmother had written, examined it carefully several times, and then marked it with a "5," little Ju Ying was very happy! However, the test was not over. Her sister turned the slate over and handed it back to her grandmother. Her sister closed the literacy textbook and said softly:
　　"One flower blooming alone does not make spring,
　　A riot of color is what makes spring."
　　The grandmother repeated her sister's words, writing each word carefully. She stopped writing at the word "zi" (紫, purple), probably stumped by the "zi" character.
　　"Girl Yun, these two sentences probably aren't in the literacy textbook; they sound like something your father has been muttering lately!"
　　"That's right!" The sister smiled and nodded: "I bet, Grandma, such good words will definitely be in next year's literacy textbook."
　　"Maybe," the grandmother said, adding, "It's hard to say. If we get rid of illiteracy this year, will we still need to print literacy textbooks next year!"
　　The grandmother then turned her eyes back to the empty space for the "zi" character. After she finished writing "qian hong cai shi chun" (千红才是春, a riot of color is what makes spring), she scratched her gray hair with one hand and tapped the slate lightly with the slate pencil, repeatedly reciting, "Zi," "Zi."
　　Little Ju Ying really couldn't hold back. She bit her lower lip hard to keep from laughing. She thought, "Grandma is not even as good as me; she's stuck on the 'zi' character." So, she closed her eyelids again, moved her little hand on her eyebrow, and used her fingertip to draw the "zi" character on her grandmother's knee.
　　The grandmother turned her head, raised her black-rimmed reading glasses, and looked closely at her little granddaughter's blinking eyelids and the little hand drawing the "zi" character, feeling delighted: "This child is really clever." But she said, "Why aren't you asleep yet? You're such a naughty little girl, not being good while pretending to sleep."
　　The grandmother scolded while gently scratching little Ju Ying's cheek and pushing the slate to her older granddaughter.
　　The sister really had the air of a teacher. She wrote a neat "zi" character in the empty space and marked it with a "4," saying to her grandmother, "I can only give you 4 points!"
　　This made little Ju Ying anxious. She scrambled up and stood on the kang, shouting at her sister:
　　"Give Grandma 5 points!"
　　The grandmother couldn't help but laugh heartily: "Give the one point deducted to little Ju Ying! She's not ashamed and is even helping Grandma cheat!"
　　Little Ju Ying's face turned red. She quickly threw herself onto the kang, closed her eyes, and went to sleep.
　　The night was already late.
　　Little Ju Ying's father and mother were walking side by side. The evening breeze blew against their faces; their cotton-padded boots stepped on the frozen snow, "ka-zhi, ka-zhi" ringing out incessantly, as if keeping time with the middle-aged couple's conversation.
　　"When I passed your factory just now, I heard gongs and drums beating inside. Why?" the mother asked the father.
　　"Reporting good news!"
　　The mother smiled dismissively: "There are only a few days left in 1959; you're just reporting good news now?"
　　The father retorted: "Do you know what kind of good news we are reporting?"
　　"Completing the annual plan, I suppose!"
　　"Don't be so shortsighted! Twenty days ago, we started producing steel for 1960!" The father held up two fingers wearing leather gloves in front of the mother: "Our factory's No. 7 furnace, nicknamed 'Miss Bear,' isn't acting like a bear this time. The gongs and drums just now were to report good news for 'Miss Bear'!"
　　"Oh, that's really interesting."
　　"Of course. Even the biggest bear can't stand it when everyone puts in effort! The advanced lead the backward, and everyone leaps forward, hey! This is really what they call, 'A riot of color is what makes spring.'" The father spoke with more and more energy.
　　"You can't do without that sentence," the mother said with a smile, glancing sideways at the father.
　　"Good words, what's wrong with saying them more?" The father also smiled, looked down at the mother's cotton-padded boots, and asked: "Where are your rubber boots? - It's just asking for trouble wearing hard-soled boots when its this cold."
　　"I just finished rushing to load and unload mineral powder, and the boots were soaked inside and out." The mother explained.
　　"Still rushing?" The father glanced at the mother with eyes accustomed to looking at molten steel. "When will you, the pioneers of transportation, fill the bellies of the steel marshals?"
　　"Bellies, bellies," the mother mimicked the father's words, feeling amused but muttering, "It's like a bottomless pit! One furnace, one utilization coefficient, eating more and more; will it ever be full!"
　　"Admit defeat?"
　　"Who admits defeat!" The mother was provoked, and she tugged at the father's sleeves: "Listen, listen!" and then shook her shoulders, laughing.
　　Nearby, there was a "whoosh—" "whump—" explosion, piercing the night sky and drifting with the wind.
　　It turned out that, to ensure that pig iron and steel materials did not touch the ground and that coal, coke, and mineral powder did not delay the trains, the transportation department was vigorously carrying out technical performance competitions of "more pulling, faster running, full loads, and exceeding axle limits, compressing the time spent in the warehouse." On the other hand, the science and technology organization led by the Party was preparing to experiment with using detonators to load coal, coke, and mineral powder into train cars or stockpiles, using explosive force instead of human labor. The sound just now was from the experiment.
　　The father was a bit at a loss. This astonishing technological innovation attracted him. He held the mother's hand tightly and turned to run towards the site of the explosion, disappearing into the night of the seething steel city....

　　夜
　　陈觉民
    五岁的小菊英，枕在奶奶的膝盖上，闭着一双机灵的眼睛，但她没有睡着。她眼皮上的睫毛时时颤动，正在想爸爸和妈妈。爸爸是全国有名的卫星号电炉炼钢工人，妈妈在运输部当电车司机。最近这些日子，为了提前完成今年的生产任务，爸爸和妈妈忙得很。瞧，已经黑天好一阵了，他们还没回来哩。
    孩子早摸透奶奶的脾气啦，要是在姐姐正教奶奶学文化的时候，还不闭上眼儿乖乖地睡，老奶奶准会生气的。现在小菊英抬起小手打掩护，才偷偷地瞧见了面对面盘坐在炕上的奶奶和姐姐。奶奶的面前放着姐姐的大石板，姐姐的手里捧着奶奶的扫盲识字课本。姐姐一字一句的细声念着，奶奶一笔一划的狠劲写着：
    “学好文化把眼睁，
    这双眼睛大有用，
    看山能知山中水，
    看水能治水中龙。”
    “在考奶奶呢！”菊英的心里在说。当姐姐移过奶奶写好字的石板，认真地审视了几遍，然后划了个“5”字时，小菊英心里可高兴啦！不过，考试还没有结束。姐姐把石板翻了个面，又递给了奶奶。姐姐合上扫盲课本，随口低声念着：
    “一花独放不是春，
    万紫千红才是春。”
    奶奶重复着姐姐的话，一字一字认真地写着。写到“紫”字时就停了笔，大概是被“紫”字难住了。
    “云丫头哇，这两句识字课本上怕没有吧，倒像是你爸近来常叨念的话呀！”
    “可不！”姐姐笑着点了点头：“我敢打赌，奶奶，这么好的话，明年的扫盲识字课本上准能有。”
    “也兴许，”奶奶说着又加了一句：“也难说呀，要是今年把文盲帽子都摘啦，明年还用印扫盲课本吗！”
    奶奶又掉过眼来瞅“紫”字的空位儿。当她继续写完“千红才是春，”后，就一手搔脑袋上花白的头发，一手用石笔轻敲着石板，嘴里反复地念道：“紫”，“紫”。
    小菊英实在憋不住了。她狠劲地咬着下嘴唇，才没笑出声来。心想：“奶奶还不如我呢，叫个‘子’字给考住啦。”于是，又闭合上眼皮，移动了一下眉梢上的小手，用食指尖儿在奶奶的膝盖上划“子”字。
    奶奶侧过头来，抬了一下黑边老花镜，细瞅了一眼小孙女眨巴着的眼皮和正划着“子”字的小手，心里乐滋滋地：“这孩子才机灵呢。”可嘴里却说：“怎么还没睡着？真是个小坏丫头儿，寐着还不老实。”
    奶奶边嚷嚷边用手轻刮了一下小菊英的脸蛋儿，将石板推给了大孙女。
    姐姐真有个当先生的架儿。她在空位上端正地写了一个“紫”字，又划了个“4”分，朝奶奶说：“只能给4分！”
    这可急坏小菊英了。她一骨碌爬起来，站在炕上，向姐姐嚷道：
    “给奶奶5分！”
    奶奶止不住哈哈大笑了：“少划的那一分就给小菊英吧！她不害臊，还帮奶奶作弊呢！”
    小菊英的脸蛋涨红了，她赶快扑到炕上，闭上眼睛，睡了。
    夜，已经深了。
    小菊英的爸爸和妈妈，肩并肩地走着。晚风吹打着他们的脸；棉皮靴踏在已经冻结了的雪层上，“卡之卡之”地响个不停，就像是给这对中年夫妇的谈话声打着拍节。
    “刚才经过你们厂时，听里面锣鼓喧天的，为啥？”妈妈问爸爸。
    “报捷呀！”
    妈妈不以为然地笑了：“1959年就剩这么几天啦，才报捷哇？”
    爸爸反问：“你知道报的啥捷？”
    “完成年计划呗！”
    “别门缝里瞧人！往前数二十天咱们就在生产1960年的钢啦！”爸爸伸出带着皮手套的两个指头儿，在妈妈眼前比划着：“咱们厂那个外号叫‘熊小姐’的七号炉子，这回也不耍熊啦，刚才敲锣打鼓就为的给‘熊小姐’报捷呀！”
    “嗬，真有意思。”
    “当然罗，再熊也架不住大伙儿都使劲呀！先进带后进，大家都跃进，嘿！这真叫，‘万紫千红才是春’呢。”爸爸越说越有劲。
    “又离不了这句话，”妈妈笑着说，朝爸爸也斜了一眼。
    “好话嘛，还怕多说？！”爸爸也笑了，垂头瞅了一眼妈妈脚上的棉皮靴，问道：“棉胶靴呢？——进九天穿硬底靴才是自找苦吃呵。”
    “刚突击装卸矿粉，靴里靴外都湿透啦。”妈妈解释着。
    “还突击呢，”爸爸用瞅惯了钢水的眼睛瞄了妈妈一眼，“你们先行官几时能填饱钢铁元帅的肚子呀？”
    “肚子，肚子，”妈妈学爸爸的话尾巴，心里乐，嘴里嘟囔：“倒像个无底洞！一炉一个利用系数，越吃越多，还有没有个饱呵！”
    “服输了吧？”
    “谁服输！”妈妈被激怒了，她猛拉了两把爸爸的袖子：“你听，你听！”就抖动着肩膀笑开了。
    近处传来了“呼——”“哗——”的爆炸声，划破夜空，随风飘荡。
    原来，为了保证生铁钢材不落地，煤焦矿粉不压车，运输部一方面大力开展“多拉快跑、满载超轴，压缩在库停留时间”的技术表演赛，另一方面党领导的科技组织，正准备试验用雷管爆炸来装满煤焦矿粉的车皮或屯货场，要以爆破力代替人力。刚刚的响声就是在进行试验。
    爸爸有些抓瞎了。这项惊人的技术革新吸引着他，他紧拉着妈妈的手，转身就朝着爆破的地方跑去，消失在沸腾着的钢城的夜里……。
