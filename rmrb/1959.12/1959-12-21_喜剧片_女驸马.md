"Female 驸马" is a traditional Huangmei Opera that was discovered during the Great Leap Forward last year, and was on the verge of being lost. This is a humorous comedy about a girl named Feng Suzhen who is loyal to her love and unwilling to marry the son of a high official. She disguises herself as a man and enters the capital under her lover's name, becoming the top scholar in the imperial examination. Unfortunately, the emperor is attracted to the new top scholar's talent and insists on recruiting him as a驸马 (imperial son-in-law), leading to a series of comedic scenes in the bridal chamber and the imperial court.

The comedy film "Female 驸马" is based on this humorous Huangmei Opera. Audiences who love Huangmei Opera and the film "The Fairy Couple" will once again see the excellent acting skills of Yan Fengying, Wang Shaofang, Pan Jingli, and others, and hear their moving singing voices in this film.

    喜剧片“女驸马”
    “女驸马”是黄梅戏在去年大跃进中发掘出来的、一个快要失传了的传统剧目。这是一出风趣的喜剧，它描写一个名叫冯素珍的女孩子，忠于爱情，不愿嫁给大官的儿子，女扮男装，顶着爱人的名字进京考中状元，不巧皇帝爱这个新状元才华出众，硬要招为驸马，于是引出了洞房和金殿一连串富有喜剧气氛的戏。
    喜剧片“女驸马”就是根据这出风趣的黄梅戏拍制的。爱好黄梅戏，喜欢“天仙配”影片的观众，又将从这部片子里看到严凤英、王少舫、潘璟琍等的优秀演技，听到他们动人的歌喉。
