Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 21st: The Shenyang City machinery industry is seizing the time to prepare for production, ensuring a "red" start in the new year.

The Shenyang City Bureau of the Machine Building Industry had already assigned the preparation work for next year's production to various factories as early as September this year, and successively convened four meetings of enterprise leading cadres to specifically arrange and inspect the work. The Party committees of many machinery factories discussed this work and assigned specific personnel to be responsible. Many factories also prepared work-in-progress and semi-finished products early. Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant started feeding materials for the products to be produced in the first quarter of next year as early as November. Most of the large parts and castings that need to be produced in cooperation with other factories have also been contracted.

The factories are also actively improving equipment and manufacturing indigenous equipment to increase production capacity; they have universally inspected existing equipment and are striving to do a good job in equipment maintenance before the end of the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 22nd: The workers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, who have already completed the national plan for this year ahead of schedule, are determined to manufacture all the parts for the products to be shipped in January next year before the end of this year, striving to produce machine tools on January 2nd, the first day of production in the new year.

This factory fully completed the national plan for this year on December 15th. That evening, the factory's Party committee held a meeting to summarize the experience of achieving a "red" year, believing that the central link to achieve a "red" start next year is balanced production. Then, the Party committee further checked the current production situation to see if there were any areas that did not meet the requirements of balanced production. It was found that by mid-December, more than 2,000 types and more than 100,000 pieces of parts for the products to be shipped in January next year had not yet been manufactured. The factory's Party committee promptly proposed to rush out the parts for the products to be shipped in January next year before the end of the year, so that machine tools could be produced on January 2nd, the first day of production in the new year.

The factory's three advanced groups took the lead in responding to the Party committee's call, jointly proposing a competition proposal to all the factory's employees: "Keep the 'red' going to the end of this year, have a 'red' start next year, and don't let the parts for the products to be shipped in January next year pass the New Year's Day." Immediately, a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy was set off throughout the factory. Production groups of the same type throughout the factory broke the boundaries of the workshops, adjusted manpower and equipment with each other, and carried out comprehensive large-scale cooperation, working together to produce parts for the products to be shipped in January next year. Veteran workers Zhang Xibao, Yao Linbao, and others, in response to the current key problem of insufficient capacity of large-scale parts processing equipment, started to rush out a large-scale indigenous floor-type milling machine to replace the gantry planer to process large parts. The design section transferred some technicians to organize a commando team to help solve technical problems in the trial production of new products in the workshop.

The workers in the smelting workshop have prepared enough coke, ferrosilicon, and ferromanganese for the production in the first quarter of next year. The transportation section decided to modify two three-wheeled dump trucks and one large dump truck before the end of the year, and trial-produce a coal shoveling machine to ensure a steady supply of raw materials needed by the production workshop.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 21st: The Nanjing Machine Tool Plant is seizing the production preparation work from many aspects to ensure a "red" start and a "red" month for next year's production.

As early as October, the Party committee of this factory, while studying and arranging the current production, discussed and arranged the production preparation work for next year. The draft production plan for next year and various technical measures have long been drawn up and handed over to various units for discussion. In terms of production technology management, according to the needs of next year's production, necessary new systems such as work-in-progress management and monthly economic indicators assessment have also been formulated, and the work-in-progress of the entire factory has been comprehensively cleaned up in order to better grasp the parts situation, have a clear picture in mind, and ensure that materials can be successfully put into production in sets and balanced production can be achieved next year.

The factory has also begun to comprehensively overhaul machine equipment to improve the precision of the equipment. The drawing design work and process card preparation work for new products have been greatly accelerated.

    沈阳机械系统具体布置在制品和半成品生产
    上海和南京机床厂抓零件管理保证新年见喜
    据新华社沈阳21日电　沈阳市机械工业抓紧各项生产准备工作，保证明年开门红。
    沈阳市机械工业局早在今年9月就向各厂布置了明年生产准备工作，并且先后召开了四次企业领导干部会议具体安排和检查。许多机械工厂的党委都讨论了这项工作，并且确定专人负责。许多工厂还及早进行了在制品、半成品的准备工作。沈阳矿山机器厂早在11月份就为明年第一季度生产的产品投了料，需要外厂协作生产的大件和铸件，也大部分签订了合同。
    各厂还积极改进设备和制造土设备提高生产能力；普遍检查了现有设备，力争在年前做好设备维修工作。
    新华社上海22日电　已经提前全面完成今年国家计划的上海机床厂职工，决心在今年年底以前制齐明年1月份出厂产品的零件，争取做到明年开工生产的第一天——1月2日就出机床。
    这个厂是在12月15日全面完成今年国家计划的。当天晚上，工厂党委就召开会议，总结了取得今年满堂红的经验，认为要实现明年开门红的中心环节是均衡生产。接着，党委进一步检查了当前的生产情况，看看有什么地方同均衡生产的要求不相符合，结果发现到12月中旬止，明年1月份出厂产品的零件，还有二千多种、十多万件没有制造出来。工厂党委及时提出在年底以前把明年1月份出厂产品的零件赶制出来，做到明年开工生产的第一天——1月2日就出机床。
    厂里的三个先进小组带头响应党委的号召，联合向全厂职工提出“今年红到底、明年开门红，不让明年1月份出厂产品零件过元旦”的竞赛倡议书。顿时，全厂掀起了增产节约的新高潮。全厂同类型的生产小组打破了车间的界限，相互调剂人力、设备，进行全面大协作，同心协力生产明年1月份出厂产品的零件。老工人张锡宝、姚林宝等，针对当前大型零件加工设备能力不足的关键，动手赶制一台落地式大型土铣床，代替龙门刨床加工大型零件。设计科抽调了部分技术人员组织突击队，到车间帮助解决试制新产品中的技术问题。
    冶炼车间的工人们，已经为明年第一季度的生产准备了足够的焦炭、矽铁和锰铁。运输科决定在年底前改装好两辆三轮卡翻斗车、一辆大翻斗车，试制成一辆铲煤机，保证源源不断地供应生产车间需要的原料和材料。
    据新华社南京21日电　南京机床厂从多方面抓紧生产准备工作，保证明年生产开门红、月月红。
    早从10月份起，这个厂的党委在研究布置当前生产的同时，就讨论安排了明年的生产准备工作。明年生产计划草案和各项技术措施，早已订好并交给各单位进行讨论。在生产技术管理工作方面，也根据明年生产的需要，制订了在制品管理、月度经济指标考核等必要的新制度，并全面清理了全厂的在制品，以便更好地掌握零件情况，做到心中有数，保证明年能够顺利地成套投料，均衡生产。
    工厂还开始全面检修机器设备，提高设备的精密度。新产品的图纸设计工作和工艺卡片编制工作都大大加快了。
