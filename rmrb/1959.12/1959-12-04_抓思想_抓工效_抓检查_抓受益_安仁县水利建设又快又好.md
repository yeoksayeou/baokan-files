Anren County's Water Conservancy Construction is Fast and Good

    (Our report) In the midst of the large-scale water conservancy construction, the vast number of cadres and people in Anren County, Hunan Province, vigorously carried out technological innovation and promoted a spirit of collaboration, achieving both high speed and guaranteed quality.
    Starting from November 8th, 60,000 laborers across the county worked on water conservancy projects. By the 23rd, after half a month, 221 new reservoirs were built, including 16 medium-sized reservoirs with dam heights of 10 meters or more, 205 small reservoirs, and 1,158 mountain ponds, and more than 11,700 wells were dug. In addition, three large-scale water conservancy projects have entered the final stage. Among them, the main canal of the Cha'an Reservoir, 50 li long, was successfully completed by 13,000 migrant workers in a seven-day battle. The county's water conservancy project was completed ahead of schedule by 47%, creating a great achievement exceeding the total water conservancy construction in the ten years since liberation by 35%. After these water conservancy projects are completed, the irrigated area will be expanded by 35,000 mu, the drainage and irrigation area will be improved by 140,000 mu, and soil erosion will be prevented on 25,000 mu, greatly improving the irrigation conditions for the county's 55,000 mu of poorly irrigated paddy fields and dry land, creating favorable conditions for the county to achieve increased production next year.
    The experience of Anren County in completing water conservancy projects in large quantities, quickly, and well is mainly due to adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and carrying out mass movements on a large scale. Cadres at all levels went deep into the construction sites, set an example, and participated in the battle with the masses. They closely grasped the following three aspects in their work:
    1. Grasp Ideology. At the beginning of the movement, the county organized a propaganda team of 10,000 people to extensively and deeply carry out ideological education among cadres and the masses on the superiority of the people's communes, the rural prospects, and love for the country, the commune, and the collective, and publicized the importance of working hard and cleverly to complete the water conservancy tasks ahead of schedule, inspiring the soaring enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses and accelerating the construction progress.
    2. Grasp Tool Reform and Improve Work Efficiency. During the construction, various localities put forward the slogan "No people are needed for taking and transporting soil, everyone contributes ideas to carry out innovation, one person should be used as a hundred people, and strive to win the first place in the whole district," setting off a mass upsurge of tool reform. The county organized 12,000 iron, wood, and bamboo workers to rush to make more than 90,000 pieces of human and animal-powered vehicles, wooden rail vehicles, pushcarts, automatic soil compactors, cranes, chutes, aerial cableways, etc., organized commune members to boil explosives, and generally realized four changes (small roads changed to large roads, winding roads changed to straight roads, small hoes changed to large hoes, manure baskets changed to bamboo baskets). After these reforms, the average work efficiency per person per day reached more than nine cubic meters of earth.
    3. Grasp Quality. In order to ensure quality during construction, ideological education for the masses was strengthened, and the slogan "Quality First for the Century-Old Plan" was put forward, calling on everyone to learn technology and ensure quality. A water conservancy headquarters was established from top to bottom, with the Party committee secretary personally serving as the commander, and farmer technicians acting as consultants, responsible for the technical guidance and acceptance of water conservancy construction. Each reservoir project trained 4,000 farmer technicians on the spot and formed technical guidance groups and acceptance groups to carry out mass mutual inspection and supervision. Nine requirements were put forward (the layout should be correct, the foundation clearing should be thorough, the backfilling should be meticulous, the tamping should be flat, the covering soil should be thin, the ramming should be tight, the slope control should be uniform, the slope joints should be seamless, and the culvert gate installation should be firm); four prohibitions (grass, tree roots are not allowed on the dam, sand is not allowed on the dam, stones are not allowed on the dam, and mud is not allowed on the dam), three guarantees (guarantee of tasks, quality, and time); and two guarantees (guarantee of construction in accordance with technical specifications, guarantee of quality) for the project. In terms of execution methods, construction was carried out one step at a time, inspection and acceptance were carried out one step at a time; then construction was carried out again, and then acceptance was carried out again.
    When the water conservancy project was about to end, the county party committee immediately organized an inspection team, led by three county party secretaries, divided into three groups, to check the quality standards of each commune, team, pond, and reservoir, check the comprehensive finishing work, and check whether the water storage capacity meets the needs of planting double-cropping rice, and conduct a comprehensive general inspection and acceptance. The inspection teams of the communes and brigades also proceeded to conduct a re-inspection. Through general inspection and re-inspection, it was found that 63 reservoirs had not opened spillways and canals, 3 culverts did not meet quality standards, and 6 earth dams were of poor quality, which were immediately organized for rework and repair. The earth dams of two reservoirs in the Duhe Brigade of the Huoguanwang Commune were not tightly compacted. After inspection, measures were immediately taken to compact them with rollers in the middle and tamp them with hammers on the sides to ensure quality. The mountain-side ends of the Hulichong Reservoir in Chengping Commune were not well connected, and trenches were immediately excavated for connection. In terms of water conservancy finishing work, it was found that the earth dams of 37 reservoirs had not been completed, 9 reservoirs needed to be raised and thickened, and 30 new mountain ponds had not been completed, and labor was immediately arranged to carry out a blitz. After inspection and repair, all projects met quality standards.
    In order to ensure that the water needs of agricultural production next year are met, the county party committee also conducted a specific accounting of the water storage of existing water conservancy facilities. The county's newly built and expanded 167 reservoirs, 202 mountain ponds, and 292 kilometers of canals have only increased the average water storage per mu by 165 cubic meters compared with last year, totaling only 741 cubic meters per mu on average. According to the calculation of 800 cubic meters of water required per mu for double-cropping late rice, there is still a shortage of 59 cubic meters. Therefore, the county also carried out a top-down survey and put forward a supplementary plan for water conservancy construction. The county planned and acted at the same time, and in less than five days, it built 54 new reservoirs and 620 mountain ponds, increasing and improving the irrigated area by 27,800 mu, ensuring both quantity and quality.

    抓思想　抓工效　抓检查　抓受益
    安仁县水利建设又快又好
    本报讯　在大兴水利建设中，湖南安仁县广大干部群众大闹技术革新，大兴协作之风，既作到了高速度，又保证了质量。
    从11月8日起，全县六万劳力兴修水利，到23日止，经过半月，新建水库二百二十一座，其中坝高十米以上的中型水库十六座，小型水库二百零五座，山塘一千一百五十八处，修井一万一千七百多处。此外三处大型水利工程已进入扫尾阶段。其中茶安水库的总支渠长五十华里，一万三千民工激战七天就胜利地完成了任务。全县水利工程提前超额47％完成计划，创造了超过解放十年来兴修水利总和35％的伟大成绩。这些水利建成后，扩大灌溉面积三万五千亩，改进排灌面积十四万亩，制止水土流失二万五千亩，使全县五万五千亩水利不好的稻田旱土，灌溉条件已大大改善，为明年全县实现增产创造了良好条件。
    安仁县水利工程完成得又多又快又好的经验，主要是坚持了政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。各级干部都深入工地，以身作则，和群众一道参加战斗。他们在工作中紧紧地抓住了以下三个环节：
    一、抓思想。运动开始，全县便组织了万人宣传队伍，广泛深入地向干部和群众进行人民公社优越性、农村远景、爱国爱社爱集体等方面的思想教育，宣传苦干巧干提前完成水利任务的重要性，鼓舞了广大干部群众的冲天干劲，加速了施工进度。
    二、抓工具改革，提高工效。在施工中，各地提出了“取土运土不用人，个个献计搞革新，一人要当百人用，夺取全区第一名”的战斗口号，掀起了群众性的工具改革高潮。全县组织了一万二千个铁木竹工赶制了人畜力车、木轨车、推车、自动压土机、起重机、滑道、高空索道等九万多件，组织社员熬制了炸药，普遍实现了四改（小路改大路，弯路改直路，小锄改大锄，粪箕改箩筐）。经过这些改革，每人每天平均工效达九方多土。
    三、抓质量。在施工中为了保证质量，加强了对群众的思想教育，提出了“百年大计质量第一”的口号，号召人人学技术，个个保质量。自上而下成立了水利指挥部，党委书记亲自担任指挥长，农民技术员当参谋，负责水利施工的技术指导和验收工作。各水库工程就地培养训练了四千名农民技术员，成立了技术指导小组和验收小组，开展群众性的互相检查监督。提出了九要（划样要正，清基要彻底，填土要细，捶土要平，盖土要薄，夯压要紧，掌坡要匀，山坡接头要合口，涵洞闸门安装要坚实）；四不准（草木树根不准上坝，砂子不准上坝，石头不准上坝，烂泥不准上坝），三包（包任务、质量、时间）；两保证（保证按技术规格施工，保证质量）的工程要求。在执行方法上，采取施工一步，检查验收一步；再施工，再验收。
    在水利工程将要结束时，县委立即组织检查团，由三个县委书记亲自带队，分成三个小组，逐社逐队逐塘逐库查质量规格，查全面扫尾，查蓄水量是否适应种双季稻的需要，全面普查验收。各公社大队的检查队，也接着进行复查。通过普查复查，在工程质量方面，发现未开溢洪道和渠道的有六十三座水库，涵洞不合质量的有三座，土坝质量差的有六座，都立即组织了反工补修。火关王公社渡河大队两座水库土坝夯压不紧，检查后立即采取中间用滚筒压，边上用夯捶打，保证了质量。承坪公社的湖里冲水库靠山两端衔接不好，马上进行了挖槽衔接。在水利扫尾工程方面，发现有三十七座水库土坝没有完工，有九座水库要加高培厚，还有三十口新建山塘未完成，也马上妥善安排劳力进行了突击。经过检查和补修，全部工程合乎质量标准。
    为了保证满足明年农业生产的用水需要，县委又对现有水利设备的蓄水情况进行了具体算账。全县新建扩建的一百六十七座水库，二百零二口山塘，二百九十二公里渠道，平均每亩较去年蓄水量只增加一百六十五方，合计每亩平均只有七百四十一方水。按照双季晚稻每亩需水八百方计算，尚缺五十九方。因此，全县又开展了自上而下的摸底工作，提出了水利建设补充规划。全县边规划边行动，不到五天，又新建了五十四座水库，六百二十口山塘，增加和改善灌溉面积二万七千八百亩，既保证了数量，又保证了质量。（安仁县委办公室）
