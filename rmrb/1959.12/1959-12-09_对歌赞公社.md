    Singing in Praise of the Commune (Lyrics)
    Wen Mangyan
	Good to plant rice in the big fields, good to sing on the mountain top, the people's commune is good in every way, happy in the heart, good to sing.
	Singing songs, let's sing songs, yours is not as many as mine, let's compete and compare, test our skills and sing in response.
	You say sing in response, I'll sing a "big" character song today, what's big? The commune is big, the five-in-one is full of energy.
	The ambition is big, the courage is big, taming mountains and subduing rivers is powerful, looking at ten years of great achievements, the future of communism is big.
	You say sing in response, I'll praise a "many" character song today, what's many? Production is many, people are many, fields are many, land is many, all walks of life have many paths.
	Production is many, income is many, prosperous and increasing production year after year, life is happy and joyful.
	Listening to you sing the "many" character song, I'll sing a "good" character song again, what's good? Everything is good, the elderly home, life is good, the nursery, is well-run, the communal kitchen of thousands of families is good.
	The food is good, the dishes are good, the taste is good, everyone is in good spirits for production.
	Listening to you sing the "good" character song, I also have a "ization" character song, what's "ization"? High speed "ization", men and women, learn culture.
	Cultivation is meticulous, the fields are garden "ized", irrigation of large fields is water conservancy "ized", quickly moving towards mechanization, and also striving for electrification.
	You sing in response, I sing in response, let's sing a "high" character song in unison, what's high? Mount Tai is high, the commune banner is higher than the mountain.
	The Great Leap Forward, jumps high, the ladder to heaven goes higher step by step, everyone says the highest thing in the world is the sky, the sky is no higher than the nine heavens, it is not as high as the Party's kindness.
	Good to plant rice in the big fields, good to sing on the mountain top, the people's commune is good in every way, singing endless songs of happiness.
	Singing from the east mountain to the west mountain, thousands of mountains and rivers all harmonize, singing back to Beijing, heaven and earth are full of songs.

    对歌赞公社（歌词）
    文莽彦大丘田里好栽禾，高山顶上好唱歌，人民公社千般好，心里快乐好唱歌。说唱歌，就唱歌，你的没有我的多，赛一赛，比一比，考考本领来对歌。你说对歌就对歌，我今唱个大字歌，什么大？公社大，五位一体干劲大。志气大，胆量大，驯山伏水威力大，眼看十年成绩大，共产主义的前途大。你说对歌就对歌，我今夸个多字歌，什么多？生产多，人多田多土地多，各行各业门路多，生产多，收益多，年年兴旺增产多，生活幸福快乐多。听你唱了多字歌，我又唱个好字歌，什么好？样样好，敬老院，生活好，托儿所，办得好，千家共灶食堂好，饭好菜好味道好，生产个个精神好。听你唱了好字歌，我还有个化字歌，什么化？高速化，男和女，学文化。耕作细，田园化，大田灌溉水利化，快速走向机械化，还要争取电气化。你对歌，我对歌，齐声唱个高字歌，什么高？泰山高，公社旗帜比山高，大跃进，跳得高，上天楼梯步步高，都说世上天最高，天高高不出九重天，比不上党的恩情高。大丘田里好栽禾，高山顶上好唱歌，人民公社千般好，唱不尽的幸福歌。东山唱到西山过，千山万水都来和，唱到北京走回来，天上地下都是歌。
