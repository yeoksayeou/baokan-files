　　How to Build a Building with Slag?

　　The silicate blocks used in the Harbin New Technology Experimental Building, the one with the largest amount used is cinder silicate. The foundation and exterior walls of this building are assembled with it. The material ratio determined after several tests for this silicate block is: to prefabricate each cubic meter of blocks, 1274 kg of cinder, 124 kg of quicklime powder, and 58 kg of gypsum are needed. After crushing these raw materials, high-pressure steam is used if there is a high-pressure steam boiler; if there is no such equipment, only the simple method of producing 90-degree steam is used, and it is put in for 24 hours to obtain lightweight silicate blocks. Compared with red brick masonry, the weight of each cubic meter of red brick masonry is 2,000 kg, while the weight of this block is less than 1,500 kg. Moreover, the thermal insulation performance obtained by assembling it into a 30 cm thick wall is better than that of a 49 cm thick red brick masonry.

　　Another type of block used for arched floor slabs, which is used in smaller quantities but has higher strength, is pumice silicate. The material ratio is: each cubic meter of blocks requires 328 kg of pumice powder, 1.2 cubic meters of ore slag, 140 kg of quicklime powder, and 27.5 kg of gypsum. Its production method is the same as that of cinder silicate.

　　How to Use Hot Air for Heating?

　　The heating equipment used in the New Technology Experimental Building—hot air radiation heat—is created by referring to the principles of modern general heating boiler equipment and ancient palace underfloor heating, creating an air heater.

　　The hot water boilers and steam boilers used for modern general heating use hot water; the ancient palace underfloor heating uses flue gas heat; while what is used here is heated air, which has neither the dangerous risk of scalding people with hot water nor the risk of smoke poisoning.

　　This new type of heating equipment is to build an air heater under the ground near the building with red bricks. Coal is burned on one side of the furnace, and many rows of pipes are installed on the other side. The flue gas passes through the pipes, which heats the air outside the pipes and inside the furnace. Here, a fan is used to force hot air into the underground earthenware pipe channel, and then into the circulation holes of the hollow wall inside the building, and finally circulates back to the air heater, repeatedly circulating endlessly. In this way, the temperature radiated from the surface of the hollow wall of the building to the room is more balanced than the heat dissipated by the radiator. Generally, when maintaining the indoor temperature at 15 to 17 degrees Celsius in cold winter climates, the surface temperature of the radiator is between 70 and 80 degrees, while the surface temperature of the hot air radiation heat hollow wall is 40 degrees. As for the coal smoke burned by the air heater, after passing through the bag-type dust filter, the carbon black is recovered before being discharged from the pipes in the furnace, leaving only waste gas. This waste gas is transferred from the underground passage to the special holes in the bathroom of the building, and then directly discharged from the roof to the outside of the building, so there is no need for chimneys to exhaust smoke, which is also of great benefit to urban sanitation.

　　怎样用炉渣造楼？
    哈尔滨建造新技术试验楼所用的矽酸盐砌块，有一种用量最大的就是炉灰矽酸盐，这座楼的基础和外墙都是用它装配的。这种矽酸盐砌块，经多次试验后确定的用料比例是：预制每立方米砌块要用一千二百七十四公斤炉灰渣，一百二十四公斤生石灰粉，五十八公斤石膏。把这些原料辗压过后，有高压蒸汽锅炉的就用高压蒸汽，没有那样设备的，只用土办法产生九十度蒸汽，把它放进去二十四小时，就可得到轻质矽酸盐砌块。和红砖砌体相比较，每立方米红砖砌体的重量是两千公斤，而这种砌块的重量却不到一千五百公斤。而且，用它装配成三十公分厚的墙壁，得到的保温性能却比四十九公分厚的红砖砌体还要好。
    另一种用作拱形楼板的用量较少、而强度更高的砌块，是浮石矽酸盐。它的用料比例是：每立方米砌块要用浮石粉三百二十八公斤，矿石渣一点二立方米，生石灰粉一百四十公斤，石膏二十七点五公斤。它的制作方法，和炉灰矽酸盐相同。
    怎样用热风取暖？
    新技术试验楼所用的取暖设备——热风辐射热，是参照了现代通用采暖的锅炉暖气设备和古代宫殿地炕采暖的道理，创造了一种空气加热炉而成的。
    现代通用采暖的温水锅炉和蒸汽锅炉，用的都是水热；古代宫殿地炕采暖，用的是烟热；而这里所用的，则是加热后的空气，既没有热水烫人的危检，也不会烟熏中毒。
    这种新式采暖设备，是在建筑物附近地面下边用红砖建造一个空气加热炉。炉膛的一边烧煤，另一边装上许多排管，煤烟在排管里通过，就把排管外边、炉膛里边的空气烧热了。在这里，使用通风机将热空气强制送入地下缸瓦孔道，再转入建筑物内空心墙的循环孔洞，最后循环回转到空气加热炉内，反复循环不已。这样，从建筑物空心墙表面辐射到室内的温度，就比暖气片散发的热量均衡，一般在冬季寒冷气候里保持室内摄氏十五度到十七度时，暖气片表面温度却在七十度到八十度之间，而热风辐射热空心墙表面温度则是四十度。至于空气加热炉燃烧的煤烟，则经过袋式烟尘过滤器，在排出炉膛内的排管以前，就收回了炭黑，只剩下废气，而这种废气由地下道转入建筑物卫生间的专用孔道后，从屋顶直接排出建筑物外，就不用烟囱排烟了，因此对城市卫生也有很大好处。
