　　Rural Railways Can Also Haul More and Run Faster
　　Meng County's rural railway's load capacity reaches 100 tons, with a traveling speed of 30 kilometers per hour
　　(Reported by our newspaper) Meng County, Shanxi Province, the originator of rural railways, continued to improve roadbeds, rail types, and locomotives this year, making the rural railways more complete. Now, the load capacity of Meng County's rural railway has increased from the original 40 tons to 100 tons, and the traveling speed has increased from 10 kilometers per hour to 30 kilometers per hour.
　　The original rural railway was 4.5 kilometers long from the Shidian Coking Plant to Taoyuan (Iron Smelting Plant), and now it has been extended by 3.5 kilometers at both ends. In this way, it connects the newly built Guju Limestone Quarry and the Nanguan Iron Factory located in the county seat. During the reconstruction, the rails were entirely changed from white pig iron to gray pig iron, and the rail type was changed from flat casting to vertical casting, so that the rail joints were changed from the rail surface to the rail side. This can reduce wheel wear and accelerate driving speed. The Shanxi Automobile Manufacturing Plant helped to produce an 80-horsepower diesel internal combustion locomotive, and the number of carriages driven by it also increased from six to ten, and the cargo volume increased from 200 to 300 tons per day to 800 tons.
　　The construction cost of this rural railway is 80,000 yuan per kilometer, which is six-sevenths less than that of ordinary railways. The carrying efficiency is equivalent to 42 cars or 267 horse-drawn carriages. Calculated at a freight rate of 4.4 yuan per ton, all the investment in building this rural railway can be recovered in eight months.

    土铁路上也能多拉快跑
    盂县土铁路载重负荷达一百吨，行车时速三十公里
    本报讯　首创土铁路的山西省盂县，今年继续改造路基、轨型、机车，使土铁路更加完善。现在盂县土铁路的载重负荷已经由原来的四十吨增加到一百吨，行车时速由十公里提到三十公里。
    这条土铁路原来从石店炼焦厂到桃园（炼铁厂）长四点五公里，现在又向两端延伸了三点五公里。这样，就把新建的古咀石灰场和设在县城的南关铁厂连接起来。改建中，道轨由白生铁全部改用灰生铁，轨型由平铸改为立铸，使道轨接缝由轨面改为轨边。这样，既可以减少车轮磨损，又加快了行车速度。山西汽车制造厂帮助制成八十马力柴油机内燃机车头，带动的车厢也由六辆增加到十辆，货运量由每天的二、三百吨提高到八百吨。
    这条土铁路每公里的建设费用八万元，比一般铁路少七分之六。载运效率相当于四十二辆汽车或二百六十七辆马车。以每吨运费四点四元计算，八个月就可以把修建这条土铁路的全部收回投资。
