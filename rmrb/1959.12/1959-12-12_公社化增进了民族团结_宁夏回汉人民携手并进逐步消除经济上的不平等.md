    Communes Promote National Unity
    Ningxia's Hui and Han Peoples Work Together to Gradually Eliminate Economic Inequality
    This newspaper reports that in the vast rural areas of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, many previously impoverished production teams have rapidly transformed into relatively prosperous or average production teams after the establishment of people's communes. This is swiftly eliminating the economic inequalities between the Hui and Han nationalities that had been historically left behind.
    Last autumn, 120 people's communes were established in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, including 425 poor teams, accounting for 28.8% of the region's production teams. These poor teams were mostly purely Hui teams or joint Hui-Han teams with a significant proportion of Hui people. The natural conditions in these poor team areas were relatively poor, farming techniques were crude, and crop yields were very low. In addition, they had long suffered from the oppression and exploitation of religious feudal privileges, and their lives were relatively impoverished. Many teams relied on state relief year after year in the past. After collectivization, under the leadership of the Party and with the vigorous assistance of the government, production greatly increased, and living conditions greatly improved. However, due to the thin foundation and small scale of the agricultural cooperatives, they were greatly limited in conquering nature and carrying out large-scale agricultural capital construction.
    People's communes have created superior conditions for eliminating the differences between poor and rich teams and the economic disparities between the Hui and Han nationalities. After communization, it became easier to organize collaboration on a larger scale, increasing the strength to overcome natural disasters. In the Yellow River irrigation area, many Hui production teams suffered from severe soil salinization. After communization, they used the power of the large collective to vigorously excavate drainage projects, improving the soil. For example, the Luoqu Brigade, where Hui people live in the Wuzhong Commune, is located in a low-lying area and used to suffer from salinization, resulting in low grain yields. This year, under the unified leadership of the commune, the production brigades supported them with more than 300 laborers, and the commune invested 7,200 yuan, spending half a month to help the Luoqu Brigade excavate 13 large and small drainage ditches, realizing a drainage (ditch) network for all farmland. This year, the average wheat yield per mu in this team reached 516 jin, an increase of 51% compared to last year. Last year, the team could not even be self-sufficient in grain, but this year, in addition to self-sufficiency, it sold more than 285,000 jin to the state. Many Hui production teams located in arid mountainous areas had unstable harvests in the past due to water shortages. However, since last year, under the unified leadership of the commune, measures have been taken to focus on water storage and vigorously build reservoirs, fundamentally changing the arid landscape. The Gaoya People's Commune in Haiyuan County used to be a place with much wind and little rain, suffering drought in nine out of ten years. Since last year, with the support of the state and other communes in the county, this commune, with the heroic spirit of moving mountains and creating seas, built a reservoir with a dam 54 meters high. Now, the entire commune can irrigate more than 50,000 mu of land, with an average of more than four mu of irrigated land per person.
    In areas where the Hui and Han people live together, people of all nationalities work together, supporting each other in terms of manpower, materials, and farming techniques, and rapidly improving the production level of the Hui teams. The Chaoyang Brigade, a purely Hui brigade in the Yanghe Commune in Yongning County, could not even set up an iron and wood farm tool factory in the past due to a shortage of manpower, insufficient funds, and technical limitations. When farm tools broke, they had to be repaired in the county town, often delaying production. After communization, the Beiquan Brigade of the Han production team took the initiative to send technicians, bringing a complete set of furnaces and tools, to help them set up a repair shop and help train technicians. When the commune was first established, the Chaoyang Brigade lacked transportation equipment. The Yongfeng and Yanghe Han teams took the initiative to allocate labor, animal power, and large carts to help the Chaoyang Brigade plow more than 160 mu of land. The commune's newly purchased tractors were also first used to plow 600 mu of land for this team. In addition, the state also gave them a loan of 10,000 yuan. With the support of the state, the commune, and fraternal brigades, the agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline production of this team have achieved great development. This year, the spring wheat yield per mu in this team reached 540 jin, an increase of 42% compared to last year, becoming the team with the highest wheat yield in the entire commune.
    The superiority of the people's communes has stimulated the production enthusiasm of the poor team members. They are full of confidence, full of energy, and striving to catch up with and surpass the advanced. The Chaoyang Brigade in Yanghe Commune, Yongning County, has a large population and little land. In order to expand the cultivated area, the team members organized an expeditionary force this spring to reclaim wasteland in the Tonggui River beach, dozens of miles away. Some female team members also brought bedding and went into battle with the male team members. In sixty-six days, they reclaimed 2,400 mu of wasteland and planted crops in time. When there was a shortage of fertilizer, the team members braved the severe cold of minus twenty degrees to dig lake mud. In just over ten days, they dug a total of 300,000 jin of lake mud. The Quyang Brigade of the Baofeng Commune in Huinong County is a Hui team with a relatively poor economic foundation and low living standards for its members. This year, in the high tide of the competition to increase agricultural production, the Party Branch put forward the slogan "Surpass Xinghuo (average teams), catch up with Miaotai (rich teams), the face of poor teams must be changed," leading the team members to bravely advance. In the past year, they have been leading in almost every aspect of production, basically catching up with the level of wealthy teams. In this summer's pre-distribution, 98% of the team members increased their income. Households that increased their income by more than 100 to 200 yuan compared to last year accounted for 65.1% of the total number of households in the team.

    公社化增进了民族团结
    宁夏回汉人民携手并进逐步消除经济上的不平等
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区广大农村，许多原来比较贫困的生产队，在人民公社化以后，迅速变成了较富裕或一般的生产队，使历史上遗留下来的回、汉民族之间的经济上不平等现象，正在迅速消除。
    去年秋天，宁夏回族自治区共建立了一百二十个人民公社，其中有穷队四百二十五个，占全区生产队的28.8％。这些穷队大多是纯回民队，或回民占相当比重的回汉联合队，这些穷队所在地的自然条件都比较差，耕作技术粗放，作物产量很低。再加上过去长期遭受宗教封建特权的压榨和剥削，生活也都比较贫困。有很多队，过去年年依靠国家救济。合作化后，在党的领导和政府的大力扶助下，生产有了很大提高，生活也有很大改善。但由于农业社的家底薄，范围小，在征服自然和大规模的农业基本建设方面，都受到了很大的限制。
    人民公社为消除穷队和富队之间的差别、回汉民族之间经济上的差别，创造了优越条件。公社化后，便于组织更大范围的协作，增加了战胜自然灾害的力量。黄河灌区的许多回民生产队，土壤盐碱化严重，公社化以后，利用大集体的力量，大力开挖排水工程，使土壤得到改良。如吴忠公社回民聚居的罗渠大队，地处低洼，过去经常遭受盐碱化的威胁，粮食产量比较低。今年在公社的统一领导下，各生产大队支援了三百多劳动力，公社投资了七千二百元，用半个月的时间，帮助罗渠大队开挖了十三条大小排水沟，使全部耕地实现了排灌沟（渠）网化。今年这个队的小麦平均亩产达五百一十六斤，比去年提高了51％。去年全队粮食还不能自给，而今年除自给外，还卖给国家二十八万五千多斤。许多处在干旱山区的回民生产队，过去因为缺水，收成极不稳定。但从去年以来，在公社统一领导下，采取以蓄为主，大力兴修蓄水库的办法，从根本上改变干旱面貌。海原县高崖人民公社，原是个风多雨少，十年九旱的地方。去年以来，在国家和全县各公社的支援下，这个社以移山造海的英雄气概，修成了一个坝高五十四米的蓄水库。现在全公社能灌溉的土地有五万多亩，平均每人有水地四亩多。
    在回汉民杂居的地区，各族人民共同携手前进，在人力、物力和耕作技术等方面相互支援，迅速提高了回民队的生产水平。永宁县养和公社纯回民的朝阳大队，过去由于人力少，资金不足，加上技术限制，连一个铁木农具厂也办不起来。农具坏了，要到县城去修理，经常耽误生产。公社化以后，汉民生产大队的北全大队，主动派去技术工人，带上全套熔炉、工具等，帮助他们办起了一个修配厂，并帮助培养技术工人。公社刚成立，朝阳大队运输工具不足，永丰和养和两个汉民队，就主动调配劳力、畜力、大车，帮助朝阳大队翻地一百六十多亩。公社新买的拖拉机，也先给这个队翻了六百亩地。另外，国家还给他们贷款一万元。在国家、公社和兄弟大队的支援下，这个队的农业、牧业、副业都获得巨大发展。今年这个队的春小麦亩产达五百四十斤，比去年增加42％，成为全公社小麦产量最高的队。
    人民公社的优越性，激发了穷队社员的生产积极性。他们信心百倍，干劲冲天，奋起赶先进，超先进。永宁县养和公社朝阳大队人多地少。为了扩大耕地面积，今年春天社员们组织了远征军，到几十里以外的通贵河滩去开荒。有些女社员也带着铺盖，和男社员一起上阵。在六十六天内，他们就开出了两千四百亩荒地，并及时种上了庄稼。肥料不足，社员们就冒着零下二十多度的严寒挖湖泥。十多天内，共挖湖泥三十万斤。惠农县宝丰公社渠羊大队是个回民队，原来经济基础较差，社员生活水平也比较低。今年在开展农业大增产的竞赛高潮中，党总支提出“超星火（一般队），赶庙台（富队），穷队面貌一定要改观”的口号，领导社员奋勇前进。一年来，他们在生产上，几乎样样领先，基本上赶上了富裕队的水平。今年夏季预分中，98％的社员都增加了收入，比去年增加一百元到二百元以上的户，就占全队总户数的65.1％。
