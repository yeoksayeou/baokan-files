Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 8th: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article today commenting on the recent meeting in Tehran of the heads of the three Asian member states of the Central Treaty Organization – Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey. The article said that the meeting was primarily aimed at promoting the "Cold War," preparing for aggression, and opposing peace-loving countries.

The article pointed out that there has been frequent diplomatic activity recently among the Asian countries of the Central Treaty Organization. Of particular note is the recent trip of the President of Pakistan to Iran and Turkey, and the meeting of these countries in Tehran.

The article said that observers especially noted that the Tehran meeting took place on the eve of the U.S. President's visit to Asian countries. The article said that the Karachi "Dawn" newspaper, in a headline of an article, demanded, "Give Turkey, Iran, Pakistan more weapons."

The article said that the participants in the meeting openly declared that now, the Central Treaty Organization is not only limited to preparing for aggression in the Middle East, but also openly threatens the national liberation movements of the African people.

The article pointed out that developments have proven that the governments of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, as before, are prepared to use military adventures to solve internal difficulties. The article said that the active activities of the Central Treaty Organization cannot but cause anxiety. The general public sees here that reactionary forces are preparing to hinder the elimination of the "Cold War."
