Xinhua News Agency Compilation: In order to accelerate agricultural technological transformation, various regions are focusing on both foreign and domestic approaches, creating new agricultural tools and improving old ones by combining indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously promoting their use. The "Tai Gu" wheat harvester, created by the Tai Gu County Farm Implement Vehicle Repair and Manufacturing Plant in Shanxi Province, is five times more efficient than manual harvesting. The Jiangxi Type 59 rice transplanter was developed based on the innovations of the masses during the tool reform movement, and its efficiency is six to eight times higher than manual transplanting. The Shanghai Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute has trial-produced and innovated more than 20 new types of agricultural machinery, and the trial results are good.

The flowers of innovation in agricultural product processing tools are also blossoming. Dongshan County in Fujian Province uses an animal-powered capstan engine to drive sweet potato processing machines, which increases efficiency by more than thirty times compared to manual operation.

Innovating pig-raising tools can greatly improve feeding efficiency. After the Youth Pig Raising Team of the Chongqing China-Soviet Friendship People's Commune mechanized feed processing and transportation, the entire team of five people raised 1,050 pigs, which is more than four times higher than the general feeding level.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th: The "Tai Gu" wheat harvester will be widely promoted in all wheat-producing areas of the country. The National "Tai Gu" Harvester Standardization Conference, recently held in Tai Gu County, Shanxi Province, after detailed research, standardized the blueprints of the "Tai Gu" wheat harvester, drafted instructions for use and product acceptance conditions, for various regions to universally imitate this winter and next spring, to prepare for the wheat harvest next year.

This harvester was researched and created by technician Li Qingzao and workers of the Tai Gu County Farm Implement Vehicle Repair and Manufacturing Plant in Shanxi Province. Its characteristics are easy operation, simple manufacturing, high efficiency, and low cost. The entire machine weighs only 173 kilograms and is inexpensive to manufacture. This harvester is pulled by one ox and operated by two people. It can harvest 3.5 mu of wheat per hour, which is five times more efficient than manual harvesting. It harvests cleanly, lays the wheat neatly, and has a lower loss rate than manual harvesting, with stubble generally left at about 8 to 10 centimeters. After the "Tai Gu" harvester was successfully trial-produced, it participated in four national harvesting tool evaluation meetings in Guangdong, Henan, Beijing, and Heilongjiang, and was exhibited at the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition. It has received good reviews at every evaluation and exhibition.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 7th: The Jiangxi Type 59 rice transplanter has been successfully manufactured. Recently, the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture held a joint appraisal and naming ceremony. Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Jiangxi Province, signed the appraisal certificate after visiting the on-site operation performance of the transplanter.

The Jiangxi Type 59 transplanter is available in both iron and iron-wood structures. The main components include seven categories: striking device, seedling box, transplanting frame, depth adjustment device, seedling box transmission device, seedling claw frame, and machine frame. The structure is relatively reasonable, the operation is quite easy, and it can transplant five rows of seedlings at a spacing of 6x6 plants at a time. One person can transplant 5 to 6 mu of rice per day, which increases the efficiency by 6 to 8 times compared to manual transplanting. The quality of transplanting is also very good, and each process reaches the level of manual transplanting, especially the straightness of the transplanting, the straight rows, the small transplanting holes, the stable seedlings, the level roots, and the uniform depth. This transplanter is suitable for early, middle, and late rice fields, and can transplant rice seedlings of different water levels, drought resistance, maturity, and tenderness.

This transplanter was gradually developed and completed based on the mass creation in last year's tool reform movement. Initially, carpenters in Nancheng and other counties made boat-type transplanters. Although the structure and principle were very good, the working width was narrow, the rows could not be aligned, and the seedling separation was not uniform enough. Later, the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Research Institute designed the Red Flag No. 1 transplanter based on the original foundation of this transplanter. The Red Flag No. 1 still used a saddle-type boat shape transplanting and failed to overcome the shortcomings of small boat bottom, long boat body, and deep sinking, making the operation laborious. After another modification and design, the Red Flag No. 2 transplanter was made, and more than 100 units were manufactured and distributed to various places for testing. In more than a year of on-site use, various places put forward many improvement opinions on the Red Flag No. 2, thereby further overcoming the shortcomings of missed seedlings, hooked seedlings, floating seedlings, injured seedlings, and uneven seedling separation, ditch compression, and mud retention. Finally, the Jiangxi Type 59 transplanter was successfully manufactured.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: The pillar-less, fully automatic, single-motor electric plow successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute has been well received by agricultural experts across the country. In the year since its establishment, this research institute has also preliminarily trial-produced and innovated more than 20 new types of agricultural machinery, such as cultivating, sowing, threshing, fertilizing, and rural transportation tools. These mechanical tools have shown good results after trial use, and some have been promoted and used in people's communes.

When the pillar-less, fully automatic, single-motor electric plow is cultivating, two moving trolleys are placed at the end of the field. The trolleys are equipped with winches, and one of them is also equipped with a motor. The steel cable on the winch extends out and is connected to the two-way plow in the field to form a straight line. When cultivation begins, the staff only needs to press the button on the electrical control mechanism in the workstation, and the motor immediately starts and drives the winch, pulling the two-way plow through the steel cable. Whenever the two-way plow finishes cultivating a row, the moving trolley automatically moves thirty centimeters to the side, allowing the two-way plow to continue cultivating. The electric plow can also cultivate in swampy areas and paddy fields where tractors cannot cultivate. It can cultivate one mu of land per hour, with a deep plowing depth of 7 to 8 inches, which is 3 to 4 times more efficient than plowing with oxen.

Another ditching and ridging machine suitable for cultivation in ridge-cultivated areas in the south can ditch and ridge 5 to 8 mu per hour, and can complete the two processes of soil crushing and ditching in one go. There are also cultivating hoe teeth, liquid fertilizer applicators, rotary plows, and transplanters suitable for vegetable areas. These new types of agricultural machinery have low costs, simple structures, and very high production efficiency. They can generally increase efficiency by 20 to 100 times compared to manual operation with hand tools, which can save a lot of labor and are easy to promote in rural areas. (Attached pictures)

    割麦　插秧　翻地各有新利器
    “太谷号”小麦收割机将在全国产麦区普遍推广
    江西五九型水稻插秧机实地鉴定效率高质量好
    上海无桩自动单马达电犁能耕旱地水田沼泽地
    本报综合消息：为了加快农业技术改造，各地从洋处着眼，从土处着手，由土到洋，土洋结合地创制新农具和改良旧农具，并且大力推广使用。山西省太谷县农具车辆修造厂创制的“太谷号”小麦收割机，比人工收割效率高五倍。江西省五九型水稻插秧机是根据工具改革运动中群众的创造，逐步发展而制成的，比手工插秧工效提高六至八倍。上海农业机械化研究所试制和革新了二十多种新型农业机械，试用效果良好。
    农产品加工工具的革新花朵也正在开放。福建省东山县用畜力绞关动力机带动番薯加工机，比手工操作提高工效三十倍以上。
    革新养猪工具，可以大大提高饲养效率。重庆中苏友好人民公社青年养猪队实现饲料加工和运输机械化后，全队五人养猪一千零五十头，比一般的饲养水平高四倍以上。
    新华社太原7日电　全国各产麦区将普遍推广“太谷号”小麦收割机。最近在山西省太谷县举行的全国“太谷号”收割机标定会议，经过详细研究以后，对“太谷号”小麦收割机做出了图纸标定，起草了使用说明和产品验收条件，供各地在今冬明春普遍仿造，为明年小麦收割提前作好准备。
    这种收割机是山西省太谷县农具车辆修造厂的技工李清藻和工人们一起研究创造出来的。它的特点是，操作容易，制造简便，效率高，成本低。整个机器全重仅有一百七十三公斤，造价低廉。这种收割机用一头牛牵引，二人操作，每小时可收割小麦三亩半，比人工收割提高效率五倍，并且收割得干净，放铺整齐，比人工收割损耗率低，留茬一般在八至十厘米左右。“太谷号”收割机在试制成功以后，曾经参加广东、河南、北京、黑龙江等四次全国收割农具的评比会议，并在全国农具展览会上展出过。在历次评比展览会上，都获得了好评。
    新华社南昌7日电　江西五九型水稻插秧机制造成功，最近中国科学院江西分院和江西省农业厅举行联合鉴定和命名仪式，中共江西省委书记、省长邵式平在参观插秧机实地操作表演后签发了鉴定书。
    江西五九型插秧机分铁和铁木结构两种，主要机件有打击器、秧箱、插秧架、深浅调节器、秧箱传动装置、秧爪架、机架等七类。结构较为合理，操作相当轻便，一次能插六×六株距秧苗五行，一个人操作，一天能插秧五至六亩，比手工插秧提高工效六至八倍。插秧质量也很好，每道工序都达到了手工插秧水平，尤其是插的正，行直，插穴小，秧苗稳定，根部平正，深浅一致。这种插秧机无论早、中、晚稻田都适用，水、旱、老、嫩秧苗都能插。
    这种插秧机是根据去年工具改革运动中的群众创造逐步发展完成的。最初南城等县的木匠们制成了船式插秧机，结构原理虽然很好，但工作幅度较狭，不能靠垅对行，分秧也不够均匀。以后，江西省农业科研所在这部插秧机的原有基础上，设计了红旗一号插秧机。红旗一号仍然采用坐骑式的船形插秧，船底小、船身长、下陷深等缺点仍未摆脱，操作费力。后经再次修改设计，制成红旗二号插秧机，并制造一百多部发给各地试验。各地在一年多的实地使用中，对红旗二号提出了许多改进意见，从而进一步克服了漏秧、勾秧、漂秧、伤秧和分秧不均、压沟拥泥等缺点，最后制造成功了江西五九型插秧机。
    据新华社上海7日电　上海农业机械化研究所试制成功的无桩全自动单马达电犁，得到全国各地农业专家的好评。这个研究所成立一年来还初步试制和革新了二十多种耕作、播种、脱粒、施肥、农村运输工具等新型农业机械。这些机械工具，经过试用效果良好，有些已在人民公社推广使用。
    无桩全自动单马达电犁耕作时有两台移行小车分置在地块的尽头，小车上都装有绞盘，其中有一台上并装有马达，绞盘上的钢丝绳引伸出去与田间的双向犁相连接，形成一条直线，耕作开始时，工作人员只要在工作台室内揿动一下电气控制机构上的电钮，马达立即开动并带动绞盘，通过钢丝绳牵引双向犁耕作。每当双向犁耕完一行时，移行小车就自动地向旁边移动三十厘米，使双向犁继续耕作下去。电犁还可以在拖拉机不能耕作的沼泽地区和水田上耕作。每小时可耕地一亩，深耕七寸到八寸，比牛耕的效率要提高三、四倍。
    另一种适合南方畦作地区耕作用的开沟作畦机，每小时开沟作畦五亩到八亩，碎土、开沟两道工序能一次完成。还有适合蔬菜地区使用的耕耘锄齿、粪液施肥机，以及旋转犁和插秧机等。这些新型农业机械成本低，结构简单，生产效率很高，一般可以比人工用手工工具操作提高功效二十倍到一百倍，可以大量节省劳动力，易于在农村中推广。（附图片）
