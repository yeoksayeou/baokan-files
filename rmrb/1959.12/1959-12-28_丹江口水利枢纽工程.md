　　Danjiangkou Water Control Project

　　The Danjiangkou Water Control Project is a key project for fundamentally controlling and comprehensively developing the Han River.

　　The Han River, with a total length of 1,530 kilometers, has a basin area of 174,000 square kilometers and an average annual runoff of over 60 billion cubic meters (the Yellow River has over 40 billion cubic meters). Because the rainfall in the upper reaches is heavy and concentrated in the summer and autumn seasons (the rainfall from July to October accounts for 65% of the total annual rainfall), coupled with the steep terrain and rapid runoff concentration, while the river channels in the middle and lower reaches are narrow with low discharge capacity, the middle and lower reaches often suffer from flood disasters. According to historical records, the Han River flooded eleven times in the eighteen years from 1931 to 1948. The construction of the Danjiangkou Water Control Project aims to fundamentally control the Han River.

　　This project is located at the confluence of the Han River and its tributary, the Dan River, in a canyon 30 kilometers above Guanghua County, Hubei Province.

　　The entire water control project includes four parts: a concrete dam, a power station, earth and rock auxiliary dams on the left and right banks, and navigation structures. The dam is 3,100 meters long, of which the concrete dam is 902 meters long and 110 meters high, equivalent to more than 30 stories high, making it one of the largest high dams in China. After the entire project is completed, the total reservoir capacity will be 28.3 billion cubic meters, which can control 68% of the water collection area during the flood season of the Han River, thereby completely eliminating the maximum flood disaster (approximately a once-in-a-century event) in the recorded history of the Han River, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of millions of people in the middle and lower reaches.

　　After the reservoir is built, water from the Han River can be diverted to irrigate more than 12 million mu of farmland in twelve counties in Henan and Hubei provinces. Together with the runoff of the Tangbai River itself, the Tangbai River area can be developed into a large-scale irrigation area of more than 15 million mu, which is expected to increase grain production by more than 7 billion jin and cotton production by 2 million dan per year.

　　The installed capacity of the Danjiangkou Hub power generation is 900,000 kilowatts, and the average annual power generation is 4.57 billion kilowatt-hours. If it is connected with power generation in Luoyang, Huangshi, Yichang and other places, it will form a huge power grid in central China.

　　After the Danjiangkou Hub project is completed, ships of 500 to 1,000 tons can travel from Wuhan to Danjiangkou; 300-ton ships can also travel from Wuhan to Baihe in Shaanxi throughout the year. Since the Danjiangkou Reservoir has an area of more than 1,000 square kilometers, the benefits of using it to raise freshwater fish will also be very considerable.

　　After the Danjiangkou Hub is completed, as long as the main canal for diverting water from Danjiangkou to irrigate the Tangbai River irrigation area is extended and a number of river-crossing structures are added, the Han River can be diverted to the Yellow River and the Huai River. This is of great significance for solving the water shortage problem in North China and North Huai areas. At the same time, the main canal can also be used to open up the North-South Grand Canal, which is extremely beneficial to the development of North-South transportation.

　　丹江口水利枢纽工程
    丹江口水利枢纽工程是根治和综合开发汉水的关键工程。
    全长一千五百三十公里的汉水，流域面积有十七万四千平方公里，六百多亿方常年径流量（黄河是四百多亿方）。由于上游雨量大而又集中在夏秋两季（7月到10月的降雨量占全年雨量的65％），加上地势陡峻，径流集中迅速，而中、下游河槽狭窄，泄量很小，中、下游地区经常遭到洪水灾害。根据历史记载，从1931年到1948年十八年中，汉水就泛滥成灾十一次。兴建丹江口水利枢纽工程，就是要从根本上治理汉水。
    这个工程位于汉水上游与支流丹江的汇合处——湖北省光化县以上三十公里的峡谷间。
    整个枢纽工程包括混凝土大坝、发电站、左右两岸土石副坝和通航建筑物等四个部分。坝长三千一百米，其中混凝土大坝长达九百零二米，坝高一百一十米，相当于三十多层楼高，是我国现时最大高坝之一。整个工程完成后，水库总容量为二百八十三亿公方，可以控制汉水洪水期集水面积的68％，从而能够彻底消灭汉水有纪录以来的最大洪水（约为百年一遇）灾害，保障中、下游数百万人民生命财产的安全。
    水库建成后，可引汉水灌溉属于河南、湖北两省十二个县一千二百多万亩农田，加上唐白河本身的径流，可使唐白河区域发展为一千五百多万亩的大型灌溉区，预计每年可因而增产粮食七十多亿斤，棉花二百万担。
    丹江口枢纽发电的装机容量为九十万瓩，年平均发电量为四十五亿七千万度。如果它同洛阳、黄石、宜昌等地发电联系起来，就将构成我国中部的一个巨大的电力网。
    丹江口枢纽工程建成后，五百吨至一千吨的轮船，可以从武汉通到丹江口；三百吨的船舶也能终年从武汉到陕西的白河。由于丹江口水库面积达一千多平方公里，利用来养殖淡水鱼类，收益也将是十分可观的。
    丹江口枢纽建成后，只要把从丹江口引水灌唐白河灌区的总干渠延长，并增加若干过河建筑物，就可以把汉水引到黄河和淮河去。这对解决华北、淮北地区的缺水问题具有重大作用，同时，还可以利用总干渠开辟南北大运河，对发展南北交通极为有利。
