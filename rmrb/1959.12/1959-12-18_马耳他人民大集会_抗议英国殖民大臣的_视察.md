    Maltese People's Rally
    Protests the British Colonial Secretary's "Inspection"
    (Via this newspaper) When British Colonial Secretary Macleod "inspected" Malta Island from the 8th to the 11th of this month, the people of Malta Island "welcomed" him with large-scale mass protest rallies. Under the huge banner "We will fight to our last breath," a protest rally attended by more than 25,000 people was held in Valletta. Malta Labour Party leader and former Prime Minister Mintoff said at the meeting: "Unless Mr. Macleod recognizes our right to self-determination, we will not hold any talks with him."
    Malta
    Malta is a small archipelago in the central Mediterranean Sea with a population of over 300,000. In 1800, Britain occupied the island, and Malta became a British colony. After the Suez Canal opened in 1869, Britain used Malta as a stopover to the East, establishing a huge naval base there, and later an air base.
    During their more than 150 years of rule over Malta, the British colonialists built large-scale naval docks, seriously damaging the economic situation of Malta. The island's annual grain production is only enough for the island's residents to eat for three weeks, and almost all of it relies on imports. Malta's industry is also very backward, with only some light industries such as beer, cigarette, button, glove, and handbag manufacturing. About half of the island's population relies on British docks for a living.
    The people of Malta Island have waged a heroic struggle against the British colonialists for a long time. The British colonialists had to implement a "constitution" (in fact, it only allowed the people of Malta Island the right to elect a legislative assembly and establish a government with certain powers to handle internal affairs), but it could not meet the demands of the people of Malta Island, so the struggle has been going on. In November 1958, a delegation representing three political parties in Malta Island (the Labour Party, the right-wing Nationalist Party, and the left-wing Democratic Nationalist Party) went to London to negotiate the future status of Malta Island and resolutely demanded independence. However, this reasonable demand of the people of Malta Island was rejected by the British colonialists. Moreover, the British government intensified its suppression and brazenly announced the abolition of the current constitution of Malta Island on January 6 this year, with the British Governor ruling entirely.
    This arrogant measure by the British government aroused even greater anger from the people of all walks of life in Malta Island. On February 3, the residents of Malta Island held a "Day of Mourning" throughout the island, despite the British authorities' ban and suppression, to protest the British House of Commons' decision on the 2nd to abolish the Constitution of Malta Island. On April 25, Malta Labour Party leader Mintoff called on all political parties in Malta to organize a "People's Front" to fight against Britain until Britain agreed to hold elections and establish a new, independent and autonomous Maltese government.

    马耳他人民大集会
    抗议英国殖民大臣的“视察”
    本报讯　英国殖民大臣麦克劳德在本月8日到11日到马耳他岛“视察”时，马耳他岛人民以大规模的群众抗议性集会来“欢迎”他。在“我们将战斗到最后一口气”的巨幅标语下面，瓦莱塔举行了有两万五千多人参加的抗议性集会。马耳他岛工党领袖、前总理明托夫在会上表示：“除非麦克劳德先生承认我们的自决权，否则我们决不同他举行什么会谈”。
    马耳他
    马耳他是地中海中部的一个小岛群，岛上有居民三十多万人。1800年，英国占领了这个岛屿，马耳他岛从此沦为英国的殖民地。1869年苏伊士运河通航后，英国把马耳他当作通往东方的中途站，在那里建立了巨大的海军基地，后来又建立了空军基地。
    英国殖民者在统治马耳他岛的一百五十多年里，大规模地修筑海军船坞，严重地损害了马耳他岛的经济情况。这个岛每年所产粮食，仅够全岛居民三个星期食用，差不多全部依靠进口。马耳他岛的工业也十分落后，仅有一些制造啤酒、香烟、钮扣、手套和手提包等轻工业。全岛有一半左右的人口依靠英国的船坞为生。
    马耳他岛人民长期以来同英国殖民者进行了英勇的斗争。英国殖民者不得不实行“宪法”（实际上仅是允许马耳他岛人民有权选举立法议会，并成立有一定权力处理内政的政府）但都不能满足马耳他岛人民的要求，所以斗争一直在进行。1958年11月，马耳他岛三个政党（工党、右翼的国民党和左翼的民主国民党）代表团到伦敦谈判马耳他岛的未来地位问题，坚决要求独立。可是，马耳他岛人民的这种合理要求，竟遭英国殖民者的拒绝。而且，英国政府还变本加厉地实行镇压，在今年1月6日悍然宣布废除马耳他岛现行宪法，完全由英国总督一手统治。
    英国政府的这一蛮横措施，激起了马耳他岛各阶层人民的更大愤怒。2月3日，马耳他岛居民不顾英国当局的禁令和镇压，在全岛举行了“哀悼日”，抗议英国议会下院在2日通过废除马耳他岛宪法的决定。4月25日，马耳他岛工党领袖明托夫号召马耳他各政党组织“人民阵线”，同英国展开斗争，直到英国同意举行选举，成立新的、独立自主的马耳他政府为止。（翁）
