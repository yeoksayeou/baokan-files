Using Wild Plants to Increase Production and Save Resources
    Dalian Jute Bag Factory Uses Wild Fibers Blended with Jute
    Jute Bag Production Increases Significantly, Completing the Annual Plan Ahead of Schedule

    (Our Dispatch) Dalian Jute Bag Factory is using a blend of 50% wild miscellaneous fibers and jute to weave jute bags. From January to October, they utilized 909 tons of wild miscellaneous fibers, increasing jute bag production by over 950,000 bags, enabling them to complete the annual state plan sixty-eight and a half days ahead of schedule.

    After criticizing the "staying at home and waiting for materials to arrive" mentality of dependence, the factory launched a high tide of research and utilization of wild miscellaneous fibers. However, problems such as the source of wild plants, preparations for processing wild miscellaneous fibers, and processing technology needed to be solved. In response, the Party Committee, after discussion, first decided to concentrate all efforts on breaking through the raw material source barrier. In addition to assigning some cadres to travel to various parts of the country to find sources of raw materials, they also actively sought ways to increase the production of degummed fiber. Procurement personnel successively found a batch of wild plants such as cotton stalks, bark, cattails, and wild flax, which basically met the needs of the production at the time. In order to quickly process these wild plants into spinnable fibers, the workers used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, using small pots and jars for degumming experiments. After the experiment was successful, they built a degumming factory with a daily output of three tons in just one month. Even before the equipment was installed and the factory building was completed, they began producing large quantities of miscellaneous fibers and weaving blended jute bags. In the process of spinning, they encountered specific difficulties. Due to the short length and poor strength of wild miscellaneous fibers, the yarn breakage rate was high during spinning and weaving. Under the leadership of the Party, they concentrated the suggestions of workers in various processes, and created an operation method for blending miscellaneous fibers and jute using the "three-in-one" method, which reduced the yarn breakage rate by one-third. The blending ratio gradually increased from 12.5% at the beginning of the year to 40%-50%.

    To enable more and better utilization of wild plants in the future, reduce the area of cultivated jute fields in the country, and support the great leap forward in agriculture, the factory has successively established wild plant processing bases in Hunan Province and San Shi Li Pu in Dalian, creating conditions for continued leaps in jute bag production next year.

### 利用野生植物增产又节约  大连麻袋厂用野生纤维与黄麻混纺  麻袋大量增产提前完成了全年计划

    利用野生植物增产又节约
    大连麻袋厂用野生纤维与黄麻混纺
    麻袋大量增产提前完成了全年计划
    本报讯　大连麻袋厂利用50％的野生杂纤维与黄麻混纺，织成麻袋，1月至10月共利用野生杂纤维九百零九吨，增产麻袋九十五万多条，使全年国家计划提前六十八天半完成。
    这个厂批判“闭门家中坐，单等料上门”的等待依赖思想后，全厂开展了研究利用野生杂纤维的高潮。但是野生植物的来源，加工野生杂纤维的准备，加工技术等问题摆在面前需要解决。党委针对这个情况，经过讨论，首先决定集中全力突破原料来源关。他们除抽调部分干部分赴全国各地寻找原料来源外，并积极想办法增加脱胶纤维的产量。采购人员先后寻找了一批棉秆皮、树皮、蒲草、野胡麻等野生植物，基本上满足了当时生产的需要。为了把这些野生植物迅速加工成可纺纤维，职工们便用土洋结合的方法，利用小锅小罐进行脱胶试验，试验成功后仅一个月就建成一座日产三吨的脱胶厂。在设备安装起来，厂房还没建成的情况下，他们就开始生产大量杂纤维，织出了混纺麻袋。在纺纱的过程中，他们又遇到了具体困难。由于野生杂纤维短，强力差，在纺纱织布时断头率高。在党的领导下，他们集中了各工序职工们的建议，以“三结合”的方法创造出杂纤维与黄麻混纺的操作方法，使断头率减少了三分之一。混纺比例由年初的12.5％逐步扩大到40％—50％。
    这个厂为使今后更多更好地利用野生植物，减少国家种植麻田的占地面积，支援农业大跃进，先后在湖南省及大连市三十里堡等地，建立了野生植物加工基地，为明年麻袋生产继续跃进创造了条件。
