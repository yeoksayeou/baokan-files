Technicians at the French Radio-Television Company announced that they will hold a forty-eight-hour strike on December 31st and January 1st, and a twenty-four-hour strike on January 3rd (Sunday). Therefore, this New Year, French television viewers may have no programs to watch, and radio listeners may only be able to listen to recorded music.
    Radio staff and technicians are protesting the government's failure to meet their demands for increased wages and improved working conditions. They already held their first strike yesterday. Yesterday, the radio station only broadcast records and two five-minute news programs. French Finance Minister Pinay originally intended to deliver a speech on economic issues on television, but was forced to cancel it temporarily.
