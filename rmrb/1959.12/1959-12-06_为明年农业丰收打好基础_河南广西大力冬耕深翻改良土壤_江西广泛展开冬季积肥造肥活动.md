Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th December: Henan Province is vigorously engaged in winter plowing, deep tilling, and soil improvement while earnestly strengthening wheat field management. Currently, the province has deep-tilled 21,710,000 mu of winter fallow land. Among these, 13,350,000 mu have been deep-tilled to a depth of eight inches or more, and 8,420,000 mu have had base fertilizer applied in conjunction with deep tilling. Xuchang Prefecture, which is progressing rapidly, has already deep-tilled 2,740,000 mu, accounting for 80% of the winter plowing area; Dancheng, Yucheng, Luyi, Shangqiu, and other counties and cities have completed their winter plowing tasks. The province has also improved 5,000,000 mu of soil in conjunction with deep tilling.

Currently, all regions are seizing the favorable opportunity before "Major Snow" (a solar term) to organize labor and animal power to carry out a concentrated winter plowing effort, determined to universally deep-plow 40,000,000 mu of winter fallow land once before "Major Snow." Tangyin County has deep-plowed over 288,000 mu of land, accounting for 52.7% of the winter plowing area. The Jiegou Commune in Yucheng County implements a流水作业法 (assembly line operation method) of simultaneously clearing stubble, topdressing fertilizer, winter plowing, and leveling land, with plows in front and cultivators behind, accelerating the winter plowing progress and improving the winter plowing quality; the entire commune has completed 82% of the winter plowing task, with depths all around 1.2 chi (approximately 16 inches).

In winter plowing and deep tilling, all regions have formulated soil improvement plans based on local conditions and adopted various measures to grasp soil improvement work firmly. Counties in the Luoyang Prefecture have built terraces and field ridges in the barren mountain areas to conserve water and soil and increase the application of organic fertilizers to thicken the topsoil, having improved 1,940,000 mu of hilly land. Xin County mixed 200 dan (approximately 20,000 lbs) of rich sandy soil and pond mud per mu into the 35,000+ mu of yellow soil hardened land that was winter plowed. Four counties, including Nanle, Lankao, Minquan, and Changyuan, adopted methods of turning soil, suppressing alkali, building沟洫台田 (ditch-terrace fields), and diverting Yellow River silt for irrigation to improve over 750,000 mu of saline-alkali land.

In order to accelerate the progress of winter plowing and soil improvement, various regions have also rushed to manufacture a large number of deep plowing tools. In Hua County, each people's commune has assigned a Party committee secretary and commune director to lead winter plowing production. The county also organized 2,400 iron and woodworking workers to rush repair and modify more than 10,000 pieces of winter plowing tools. In reforming winter plowing tools in Lingbao County, the commune machinery factory and the production team's repair shop played a significant role.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 5th December: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has winter-plowed over 14,000,000 mu of land, of which about 40% is deep-plowed to a depth of six inches or more.

This year, the Autonomous Region's winter plowing work started early, progressed rapidly, and the quality is also better than in previous years. As early as during the autumn harvest, the people's communes in Liuzhou, Guilin, Yulin, Nanning, and other prefectures implemented simultaneous harvesting, plowing, and winter planting. After the autumn harvest, these regions also organized specialized teams for winter plowing and deep tilling. The start time of deep tilling was generally one month earlier than last year. In some people's communes in counties such as Luzhai and Mashan, the medium and late rice harvests were completed, and deep tilling was basically finished.

In the winter plowing and deep tilling work, many pacesetters and skilled individuals using new-style farm tools have emerged in various places. Lu Xiuyu, a young female commune member of the Longchong Commune in Xincheng County, used two double-wheeled double-share plows, commanding four large water buffalo, creating a new record of plowing 22 mu per day. A few days later, Huang Youfu, a commune member of the Daan Commune in Laibin County, surpassed Lu Xiuyu, plowing 24.5 mu per day. Not long after, this record was broken again by Wei Tianfu, a commune member of the Taiping Commune in Yishan County. Wei Tianfu's record was: plowing 25 mu of land per day. After launching a labor competition of striving to be the best, vying for pacesetter status, and catching up with each other, the Nanxiang Commune in Heng County increased each laborer's average daily deep plowing of land from 0.5 mu to 3 mu.

Various regions have universally adopted methods such as holding on-site meetings and visits, evaluations, and debates to summarize the experience gained in increasing production through deep plowing and soil improvement last year, and repeatedly criticized right-leaning conservative ideas such as "deep plowing stirs up new soil, and thin fields do not increase production." Many communes have also specially established deep plowing command posts, implemented the leadership of the secretary in charge, and established a contract responsibility system to strengthen the leadership of winter plowing and soil improvement work.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 5th December: Commune members in various parts of Jiangxi Province are widely launching winter manure accumulation and fertilizer production activities. By the end of November, the province had accumulated an average of about 40 dan of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, a fivefold increase compared to the same period last year.

In manure accumulation, Party committees at all levels have timely strengthened political and ideological leadership. Addressing the right-leaning conservative ideas existing among some cadres, such as "there is no fertilizer to accumulate" and "accumulating more fertilizer means not accumulating good fertilizer,"座谈会 (symposiums) and mass meetings were held promptly, and宣传教育 (propaganda and education) was carried out starting with publicizing the favorable situation, detailed accounting, and summarizing the experience of bumper harvests, boosting the enthusiasm of the broad masses. More than 100 youth amateur fertilizer accumulation shock teams in Guangchang County used the time during early mornings and evenings to collect more than 300,000 dan of pig and cattle manure.

In order to accumulate "more, faster, and better" fertilizer, various regions have adopted a combination of regular fertilizer accumulation and concentrated fertilizer accumulation, specialized team fertilizer accumulation and mass fertilizer accumulation, and collective fertilizer accumulation and individual fertilizer accumulation, ensuring that everyone, every household, and every team accumulates fertilizer. In terms of fertilizer accumulation methods, activities such as "shoveling, cutting, sweeping, burning, picking up, fermenting, and creating" were carried out based on the principle of "relying on the mountains for what the mountains have, and relying on the water for what the water has." Many places also organized specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, youth shock teams, and expedition teams to set up camps in deep mountains and remote forests and by the lake to concentrate on fertilizer accumulation.

Considering the tight schedule of agricultural work next spring and in order to save manpower for transporting fertilizer and accelerate the transformation of low-yield fields, various regions are vigorously building winter cellars and fertilizer bases by ponds, ditches, fields, and land. Jinxian County dug more than 38,000 fertilizer cellars in the fields. The members of the Tufang Brigade of the Jiaqiao Commune side by side shoveled grass, picked up manure, and fermented the cellars. The entire team has more than 710 manure cellars, accumulating more than 167,000 dan of fertilizer, reaching one manure cellar per mu. The Shangrao Prefecture established more than 10,000 collective pig farms on more than 1,000,000 mu of cultivated land, accumulating a large amount of pig manure.

While accumulating and producing large quantities of fertilizer, various regions have also adopted measures to actively "preserve fertilizer." In order to ensure that manure has cellars, ash has sheds, and livestock has pens, some regions have built toilets, manure pits, fertilizer sheds, etc., so that fertilizer bases are managed by dedicated personnel. Field management of green manure is also highly valued in various regions, and activities such as ditching for drainage, covering grass for frost protection, and applying fertilizer to protect seedlings have been universally carried out.

    为明年农业丰收打好基础
    河南广西大力冬耕深翻改良土壤
    江西广泛展开冬季积肥造肥活动
    新华社郑州5日电　河南省各地在认真加强麦田管理的同时，大搞冬耕深翻地和土壤改良。目前全省已深翻冬闲地二千一百七十一万亩。其中深翻八寸以上的达一千三百三十五万亩，并有八百四十二万亩结合深翻施了底肥。进度快的许昌专区已深翻地二百七十四万亩，占冬耕面积的80％；郸城、虞城、鹿邑、商丘等县市已完成冬耕任务。全省还结合深翻地改良土壤五百万亩。
    目前，各地都在抓紧“大雪”前的有利时机，组织劳、畜力，突击冬耕，决心把四千万亩冬闲地在“大雪”前普遍深耕一遍。汤阴县已深耕土地二十八万八千多亩，占冬耕面积的52.7％。虞城县界沟公社实行边腾茬、边追肥、边冬耕、边平整土地的流水作业法，前犁后套，前耕后刨，加快了冬耕进度，提高了冬耕质量；全社已完成冬耕任务82％，深度都在一尺二寸左右。
    各地在冬耕深翻地中，都因地制宜地制订了土壤改良规划，采取各种措施抓紧土壤改良工作。洛阳专区各县在山岗瘠薄地里修筑梯田、地埂来保持水土，并增施有机肥料加厚土层，已改良丘陵地一百九十四万亩。新县把冬耕的三万五千多亩黄土板结田，每亩都掺了沃沙土和塘泥二百多担。南乐、兰考、民权、长垣等四个县采用翻土，压碱，修筑沟洫台田和引黄淤灌的办法，改良沙碱地七十五万余亩。
    为了加快冬耕和改良土壤的进度，各地还赶制了大批的深耕工具。滑县各人民公社都抽出一名党委书记、社长领导冬耕生产。全县还组织二千四百名铁木工人突击修配和改制冬耕工具一万多件。灵宝县在改革冬耕工具中，公社机械厂和生产队的修配厂起了很大作用。
    新华社南宁5日电　广西僮族自治区已冬耕田地一千四百多万亩，其中深耕六寸以上的约占40％左右。
    今年自治区的冬耕工作开始早，进展快，质量也比往年好。早在秋收期间，柳州、桂林、玉林、南宁等专区的人民公社，就实行边收、边耕、边冬种。秋收结束以后，这些地区又都组织了专业队冬翻深耕。深耕开始的时间大都比去年提前了一个月。鹿寨、马山等县有些人民公社，中稻、晚稻收完，深耕也就基本结束了。
    在冬翻深耕工作中，各地出现了许多使用新式农具的标兵能手。忻城县隆充公社女青年社员陆秀玉，用两架双轮双铧犁，指挥四头大水牛，创造了日犁二十二亩的新纪录。不几天，来宾县大安公社社员黄有福赶过了陆秀玉，日犁二十四亩半。时隔不久，这个纪录又被宜山县太平公社社员韦天福突破了。韦天福的纪录是：日犁地二十五亩。横县南乡公社在开展了争上游、夺标兵、你追我赶的劳动竞赛后，每个劳动力由原来平均每日深耕地五分提高到三亩。
    各地普遍采取了召开现场会和参观、评比、辩论等方法，总结了去年深耕和改良土壤获得增产的经验，反复批判“深耕起新土，田瘦不增产”等右倾保守思想。许多公社还专门成立了深耕指挥部，实行书记挂帅，建立了包工责任制，加强冬翻地和改良土壤工作的领导。
    新华社南昌5日电　江西省各地社员广泛展开冬季积肥、造肥活动。截止11月底，全省已给每亩耕地平均积肥四十担左右，比去年同期增长了五倍。
    在积肥中，各级党委及时加强了政治思想领导。针对部分干部中存在的“无肥可积”、“要多积肥就不能积好肥”等右倾保守思想，及时召开了座谈会、群众大会，从宣传有利形势、算细账和总结丰产经验入手，开展了“粮食是宝，无肥成草”，“今冬多积万担肥，来年多收万斤粮”的宣传教育，鼓起了广大群众的干劲。广昌县的一百多个青年业余积肥突击队，利用早晚休息的时间，拾猪、牛粪肥三十多万担。
    为了“多积、快积、积好”肥料，各地采取了经常性积肥和突击性积肥、专业队积肥与群众性积肥、集体积肥和个人积肥相结合的办法，做到人人、户户、队队都积肥。在积肥方法上，根据“靠山向山要，近水向水要”的原则，开展了“铲、割、扫、烧、拾、沤、造”等活动。许多地方还组织了积肥专业队、青年突击队、远征队等到深山远林和湖边安营扎寨，突击积肥。
    考虑到明春农活紧张，为了节省运肥人力，加速改造低产田，各地在塘边、圳边、田头、地头大搞冬窖子和肥料基地。进贤县在田头挖肥窖三万八千多个。架桥公社土坊大队的队员们边铲草、边拾粪、边沤窖，全队七百一十多个粪窖，已积肥十六万七千多担，达到每亩有一个粪窖。上饶专区在一百多万亩耕地上建立了一万多个集体养猪场，积攒了大量猪肥。
    在大量积肥造肥的同时，各地还采取办法积极“保肥”。有些地区为做到粪有窖、灰有棚、畜有栏，修建了厕所、粪坑、肥棚等，使肥料基地都有专人管理。对绿肥的田间管理各地也很重视，普遍进行了开沟排水、盖草防冻、施肥保苗工作。（附图片）
