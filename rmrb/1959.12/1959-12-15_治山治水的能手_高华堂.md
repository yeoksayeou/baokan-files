A Master of Mountain and Water Management – Gao Huatang
By our reporter Qu Yifan

    Gao Huatang is a red banner leader in mountain and water management and soil conservation in the northwest mountainous region of Hubei. He leads the masses of the Dayan Commune Construction Management District in Yun County, fighting against nature day after day for ten years, turning barren mountains and ridges with poor soil into flower-fruit mountains with green mountains, clear waters, fragrant rice, and sweet fruits.

          Poverty Spurs Change
    Those familiar with Gao Huatang most admire his boundless love for his hometown and his indomitable and tenacious dedication to the cause of constructing mountainous areas and transforming the face of nature. After liberation, Gao Huatang, who was only in his twenties and came from a background as a hired laborer and carpenter, served as the chairman of the township farmers' association. After the land reform, he was very concerned about fundamentally addressing the problems of poor mountains and rivers.

    One day, Gao Huatang and Deputy Township Chief Yang Mingdao walked out of the township farmers' association. The farmers' association was located on a mountain ridge in Fanshanyan, with another high mountain opposite. Between the two opposing peaks was a narrow valley hundreds of feet deep, with the Xiang'er River rushing turbulently. They looked from this mountain to that mountain, seeing rocks and barren slopes everywhere, high mountains and steep slopes, deep ravines and shallow rivers, small forests, withered wild grass, and weak and thin crops. They both grew up in this poor mountain valley and deeply understood the suffering of the mountain people. As they walked down the hillside, they came to an ancient Fanshanyan aqueduct and suddenly their eyes lit up. Below the several-mile-long channel, dozens of acres of terraced fields were laid out, with rice growing luxuriantly and the channel water flowing gently. Barren slopes and terraced fields formed such a vivid contrast! From then on, Gao Huatang made up his mind: under the leadership of the Party, to lead the masses in fundamentally addressing the problems of poor mountains and rivers.

    Gao Huatang was wholeheartedly committed to opening up a new path in the mountainous area. He took the lead in turning the three acres of hillside land newly distributed during the land reform into terraced fields. Soon, under the leadership of the Party, the mutual aid and cooperation movement was launched. At this time, Gao Huatang was the Party branch secretary. He organized the first mutual aid group with only six households. As soon as the mutual aid group was established, he discussed with everyone about first modifying a few acres of terraced fields using the water from the old Fanshanyan. That year, rice was planted, and the yield was several times higher than that of the slope land. The members tasted the sweetness and became even more motivated.

        High Mountains and Flowing Water
    In the winter of 1955, the Party Central Committee issued instructions to strengthen production and construction in mountainous areas, followed by a surge of merging large townships and transitioning to advanced cooperatives. Fanshanyan Township and four and a half neighboring townships were merged to form a large township – Construction Township. Nine advanced cooperatives were established in the township, with more than 90% of the farmers participating. Gao Huatang was elected secretary of the general Party branch of the large township, and Yang Mingdao was the deputy secretary. Lao Gao and his partners said, "This time, there is a way to repair the canals, and we must do it vigorously!" Then they climbed mountains and ridges, crossed gullies and streams, inspected the terrain everywhere, selected the canal routes, and then put forward a preliminary water and mountain management plan at the general Party branch meeting. This plan included building more than fifty winding mountain canals and transforming 1,500 acres of terraced fields in the entire township in one winter and spring. Later, this water and mountain management plan was approved at the township farmers' representative meeting. Then a water conservancy technician was sent from the county water conservancy bureau to assist in measuring the canals. Gao Huatang roughly showed him the surrounding terrain, and the technician shook his head and said, "Lao Gao, it's difficult! This project is huge, the canals are long, the slopes are steep, and there are many gullies. It costs a lot of money, so we can't start blindly!" He readily issued a bill of materials: cement, lime, explosives, steel chisels, iron hammers... all in the thousands and tens of thousands, estimating that it would cost at least ten thousand yuan in investment. The technician left. Gao Huatang ran to the district committee overnight to ask for instructions. The district committee secretary encouraged him, saying, "Is this too difficult? Won't you mobilize the masses and do it yourself!" Gao Huatang returned from the district and found cadres and activists to discuss it together. First, he proposed measuring the canals and doing it himself. Gao Huatang also learned carpentry in his childhood and knew a little about masonry and stringing lines. He and the old carpenter Tu Guobing brought a long ruler, a tool commonly used by carpenters, and dug a groove in the ruler, pouring in a few drops of water to replace the "horizontal measuring instrument." They stood on this mountain and aimed at the mountain opposite, measured a section, and sprinkled lime marks, and a large group of people behind them began to dig the canals. The originally planned cement was replaced by lime burned by the cooperative members themselves. For explosives, they asked the old hunter Li Zhenqing and others to prepare homemade explosives. Steel chisels and iron hammers were brought by the cooperative members themselves if they had them, and if they did not have enough, the blacksmiths in the cooperative opened the furnace to make them themselves... With the support of the broad masses, all difficulties were solved.

    Where should the canal head be located? It also caused a lot of controversy. There was an old Fanshanyan in the township, but the canal head was low, the canal route was short, and the water was insufficient, so it only climbed halfway up the mountain and then plunged straight down. Gao Huatang had walked countless times along the old Fanshanyan, from the tail of the canal to the canal head, and figured out a truth: as the saying goes, "Trees have roots, and water has sources." To manage water, first manage the source. If the water source is high and the canal route is long, the water level can be raised higher and the water can be diverted to high mountains. So he led the masses from the canal head of the old Fanshanyan, against the Xiang'er River, and found the source of the river under Ma'anshan Mountain. They cleared all the twenty-eight springs at the source, the spring water rolled and surged, and the flow of the Xiang'er River suddenly increased greatly. They opened a new fifteen-mile-long canal from the foot of Ma'anshan Mountain, which is more than 1,200 meters above sea level, from the riverbed to the hillside, and from the hillside to climb the mountain ridge, and the canal water flowed onto Jiuligang, which is more than 600 meters above sea level. This is the first winding mountain canal in the entire township.

        Terraces All Over the Mountains
    In the spring of 1957, Cui Mingquan, the first secretary of the Yun County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to Jiuligang and was led by Gao Huatang and others to visit the newly built winding mountain canal and the newly modified terraced fields on the hillside. Secretary Cui praised Gao Huatang and his team for doing a good job, and at the same time encouraged them:

    "Lao Gao! You have so much water and so many mountains, can you further build canals on all the mountains and turn all the slopes into terraced fields?"
    "Yes! We definitely can!"
    "That's right! The vision of a Communist Party member must be broader."

    After Lao Gao sent the county Party secretary away, he immediately convened a general Party branch meeting to discuss a comprehensive plan for large-scale water conservancy and large-scale terraced field modification. From the beginning of winter this year, a new upsurge of water and mountain management, like a prairie fire, was set off in Construction Township.

    At first, they modified the fields by small teams and groups, dividing their forces and occupying each mountain. After working for some days, due to the thin manpower, not many fields were modified, and the masses could not see significant results, so they gradually became lax. The general Party branch discovered this problem and decided to concentrate manpower, make key breakthroughs, and implement large-scale operations. The entire township was divided into several fronts, with Gao Huatang leading a large number of people to specialize in repairing canals. In a few days, they completed a winding mountain canal, and then repaired the second and third...; Yang Mingdao led another large number of people to completely transform one hundred acres of slope land on Sanligang into terraced fields in twelve days, and then modified the second and third mountains.... In this way, one canal in a few days and one mountain in a few days, the people's hearts were uplifted, and the mountains and rivers changed. After everyone's hard work in one winter and one spring, winding mountain canals were built on all twenty-eight mountain ridges in the entire township, and blocking dams and ponds were built in all the ravines. Wherever the canal water flows, the people on that mountain urge their children to quickly modify the fields, and they excitedly say, "The water is gurgling on the mountain ridge, if we don't modify the fields now, when will we wait!" Everywhere on the mountain ridges, gongs and drums are beating, and people are working harder and happier, as if they are celebrating a happy event.

    One day, Gao Huatang climbed from Jiuligang to Yangjiawan on the opposite hillside and saw that there were still more than sixty acres of slope land on this side. Why not quickly turn it into terraced fields? He inquired from the cadres of the production team and found out that this was an isolated mountain with no water in the gully, and the canal water of Jiuligang could not cross the big gully. "Without water, how can we modify the fields?" "Divert the water from the 'May Fourth' long canal on Jiuligang to this mountain!" Now, Gao Huatang is like a water conservancy expert. He personally measured and led the construction of all eighty or ninety canals in the township. He was determined to make the water "cross the valley and fly over the stream." He first used the earthen method to experiment with making a "diversion pipe," using the pressure of the water to pass through a culvert through the bottom of the gully and suck it to the hillside four feet high on the opposite side. The experiment failed three times in a row. Finally, the method of building an aqueduct across the mountain was changed, and finally the aqueduct was built, and sixty acres of slope land was immediately turned into terraced fields. That year, the rice harvest was abundant, and every household in Yangjiawan ate the rice they grew themselves.

      Building a Flower-Fruit Mountain
    In the blink of an eye, it was the autumn of 1958. The masses in the mountainous areas warmly welcomed the people's commune movement, and Construction Township became a management district of the Dayan Commune. Once, Gao Huatang went to the county town for a meeting, and the county Party secretary Ren Hailong warmly greeted him into the room and personally handed the honorary certificate awarded to Construction Township by the State Council to Lao Gao. At this time, Gao Huatang felt a warm rush in his heart, and his face flushed, but he became uneasy, feeling that he had done too little work.

    "Lao Gao, can fruit trees be planted on your big mountain?"
    "Yes!" Gao Huatang, who has always listened to the Party's words, suddenly had his eyes light up after being reminded by the county Party secretary.

    Sure enough, soon, on Jiuligang, which is ten kilometers long and nearly a thousand meters high, another wave of greening barren mountains and building flower-fruit mountains was set off. Under the leadership of the county Party committee and the Dayan Commune Party committee, the "Construction Flower-Fruit Mountain Headquarters" was established. Each management district of the entire commune formed an army of 2,400 people to manage the mountains and build flower-fruit mountains. Within a week, 500,000 fish-scale pits were dug all over the mountains, and more than 10,000 acres of forest were planted, with more than 80,000 fruit trees such as citrus, apples, pears, and peaches. Various local specialties also developed rapidly. Dragon beard grass, tung oil, tea seeds, and tea leaves all grew from scratch, from less to more, making the high mountains even more beautiful. The rapid development of production has also brought about the prosperity of agricultural and sideline product processing industries. Therefore, paper making, oil pressing, wild fruit wine making, wild fiber processing, water-powered processing factories and workshops have been established one after another. With so many things being produced, how can the rugged mountain roads be transported? They concentrated their efforts and rushed for three days and nights to build a new eighteen-kilometer-long mountain road, winding from Jiuligang directly to the old Fanshanyan.

    After this autumn, they once again held high the red banner of mountain and water management and soil conservation, and worked hard for more than a month. By mid-November, the entire management district had built twelve winding mountain canals (main canals) and more than ninety branch canals, and transformed more than 8,000 acres of terraced fields and more than 7,000 acres of terraced land.

    From liberation to this year, the annual grain output of the entire management district has increased twelvefold in ten years. The economic income of the cooperative members has also soared from an average of more than seventeen yuan per person in the early days of liberation to more than one hundred and forty yuan. The historically "poor mountain valley" that lacked food and clothing has now become a "mountain paradise" with abundant food and clothing. (Attached picture)

    治山治水的能手——高华堂
    本报记者　曲一凡
    高华堂，是湖北西北山区的治山治水治土的红旗手。他领导着郧县大堰公社建设管理区群众，十年如一日，向自然开战，把穷山恶水、草木不长的荒山秃岭，变成山青水秀、稻香果甜的花果山。
          穷则思变
    熟悉高华堂的人，最佩服他对自己家乡的无限热爱，对于建设山区改造自然面貌百折不挠、坚韧顽强的事业心。解放以后，年仅二十多岁的雇工和木工出身的高华堂，担任着乡农民协会主席。土改结束，他就十分关心根治穷山恶水的事。
    一天，高华堂同副乡长杨明道从乡农会走出来。农会就扎在翻山堰的一条山梁上，对面也是一座高山。两座对峙的山峰中间，是几百丈深的狭谷，响耳河水在狭谷里湍急地奔流着。他们从这山望到那山，到处是乱石荒坡，山高坡陡，沟深河浅，树林矮小，野草黄瘦，庄稼苗细弱似线。他们都是在这穷山沟里长大的，对山里人的苦难体会最深。当他们走下山坡，来到一条古老的翻山堰水渠跟前，忽觉得眼前一亮，只见在几里长的渠道下面，摆开几十亩梯田，稻谷长得爱人，渠水潺潺流着。荒坡与梯田，这是一幅多么鲜明的对照啊！高华堂从此拿定主意：在党的领导下，带领群众根治穷山恶水。
    高华堂一心一意要在山区打开一条新路。他先带起头，把土改中新分的三亩山坡地，改成了梯田。不久，在党的领导下，开展了互助合作运动。这时高华堂是党支部书记。他组织了第一个只有六户的换工互助组。互助组一成立，他就和大伙商量，先就老翻山堰的水改了几亩梯田，当年栽上水稻，产量就比坡地翻了几番。组员们尝到了甜头，劲头更大了。
        高山流水
    1955年冬天，党中央发布了加强山区生产建设的指示，接着又掀起了并大乡、转高级社的热潮。翻山堰乡和相邻四个半乡合并，建成一个大乡——建设乡。全乡办起了九个高级社，90％以上的农户都参加了高级社。高华堂当选大乡党总支书记、杨明道为副书记。老高同他的伙伴们说：“这一回，修渠的事可有门路啦，定要轰轰烈烈地大干一场！接着他们爬山越岭，穿沟过涧，到处察看地形，选定修渠路线，然后就在党总支会议上提出了一个初步的治水治山规划。这个规划包括修建五十几条盘山大渠，在一个冬春全乡改造梯田一千五百亩。后来这个治水治山规划在乡农民代表会上通过了。接着从县水利局派来一个水利技术员，协助测量渠道。高华堂领他粗粗看了周围的地形，这位技术员摇头说：“老高，难哪！这工程很大，渠长、坡陡、沟多，花钱多，可不能盲目动工哇！”他顺手开出一份工程账单：水泥、石灰、炸药、钢钎、铁锤……等，都是成千上万，估计起码得花万把元的投资。技术员走了。高华堂连夜跑到区委会请示，区委书记鼓励他说：“这就难住了吗？你们不会发动群众，自己动手干起来！”高华堂从区里回来，就找干部、群众积极分子一起商量。首先提出测量渠道，自己动手干。高华堂幼年也学过木匠，砌屋吊线的事也通达点儿。他同老木匠涂国炳一起，带上木匠惯用的长尺杆，在尺杆上挖一道槽，灌上几滴清水，代替“水平测量仪”。他们站在这山，往对面山上瞄准，测一段，撒下石灰印，后面大批人马便开挖渠道。原计划用的水泥，改由社员自烧石灰代替。炸药，请出老猎手李振清等配制土炸药。钢钎、铁锤，凡是社员有的都自带自用，不够的再由社里的铁匠开炉自造……。有广大群众支持，一切困难都迎刃而解。
    渠首安在哪里？也曾引起不少的争论。乡里有条老翻山堰，可是渠首起得低，渠路短，水不足，只爬到半山坡，就直泻而下。高华堂曾经无数次地沿着老翻山堰，从渠尾走到渠首，琢磨出一条道理：俗话说“树有根、水有源。”治水先治源，水源高，渠路长，水位就能抬得高，引水上高山。于是他带领群众从老翻山堰的渠首，逆响耳河而上，找到了马鞍山下的河水源头。他们把源头的二十八口泉全部疏通，泉水翻滚汹涌，响耳河的流量顿时大增。他们就从拔海一千二百多米的马鞍山的脚下，新开一条十五里长渠，由河床到山坡，由山坡爬上山梁，渠水潺潺流上了拔海六百多米高的九里岗上。这是全乡开天辟地第一条盘山长渠。
        遍山梯田化
    1957年春天，中共郧县县委第一书记崔明全来到九里岗，由高华堂等领着参观了新修的盘山长渠，和山坡上新改的梯田。崔书记称赞高华堂他们这件事办得好，同时又鼓励说：
    “老高！你们有这么多的水，这么多的山，能不能进一步把所有的山都修上渠，把所有的坡地都改成梯田呢？”
    “能！一定能！”
    “对！共产党员的眼光，就是要看的更远些。”
    老高送县委书记走后，马上又召开党总支会议，讨论大修水利、大改梯田的全面规划。由这年入冬起，在建设乡掀起了野火燎原、热气腾腾的治水治山新高潮。
    起初，他们是按一个小队、一个小组为单位改田，分兵把口，各占一架山。干了一些日子，由于人力单薄改田不多，群众看不出显著成绩，逐渐有些松气。党总支发现这个问题，决定集中人力，重点突破，实行大兵团作战。全乡分成几条战线，由高华堂率领大队人马专管修渠，几天就突击完成一条盘山渠，接着再修第二条、第三条……；另由杨明道率领大队人马，十二天就把三里岗上一百亩坡地全部改成梯田，接着再改第二架山、第三架山……。就是这样，几天一条渠，几天一架山，人心振奋，山河变样。经大家苦战一冬一春，全乡二十八架山梁，山山都修了盘山渠，沟沟都修了拦冲堰塘。渠水流上哪架山，哪个山上的人就呼儿唤女催着快去改田，他们兴奋地说：“山梁上，水流哗哗响，再不改田，等待何时呀！”到处山梁上锣鼓喧天，人们越干越欢，像是办喜事一样。
    有一天，高华堂从九里岗爬上对面山坡的杨家湾，看见这面坡上还有六十多亩坡地。为啥不快改成梯田呀？他向生产队的干部一打听，原来这是一座孤山，沟里无水，九里岗的渠水隔着大沟也过不来。“没有水，咋改田呢？”“把九里岗上‘五四’长渠的水调过这山头来！”现在，高华堂俨然是一位水利专家了，全乡八、九十条渠都是他一手测量和亲自领导施工的。他决心要叫水“越谷飞涧”。他先用土法试验做“导虹管”，利用水的压力，通过暗渠穿过沟底，吸到对面四丈高的山坡上。连试验了三次都失败了。最后，改用隔山架渡槽的办法，终于把渡槽架成了，六十亩坡地马上改成了梯田。当年稻谷丰收，杨家湾家家户户吃上了自己种的大米。
      建设花果山
    眨眼到了1958年秋天。山区群众热情地迎接了人民公社化运动，建设乡成为大堰公社的一个管理区。有一次，高华堂到县城开会，县委书记任来龙亲热地招呼他到屋里，亲自把国务院奖给建设乡的光荣奖状交给老高。这时，高华堂心里一阵热烘烘的，脸上泛起了红晕，反而不安起来，觉得自己的工作做得太少了。
    “老高，你们那大山上，能不能栽果木树呀？”
    “能栽！”一向听党的话的高华堂，经县委书记一提醒，忽觉得眼前一亮。
    果然不久，在长达十公里、高近千米的九里岗上，又掀起了绿化荒山、建设花果山的浪潮。在县委和大堰公社党委领导下，成立了“建设花果山总指挥部”。全公社各管理区组成二千四百名治山大军，建设花果山。一周内，遍山挖鱼鳞坑五十万个，造林一万多亩，栽柑桔、苹果、梨、桃等果树八万多株。各种土特产也迅速发展了，龙须草呀，油桐呀，茶子呀，茶叶呀，都从无到有，由少到多，把高山装饰得更加美丽了。生产的高速发展又带来了农副产品加工工业的繁荣，于是造纸、榨油、野果酿酒、野生纤维加工、水力加工工场和作坊，都纷纷建立起来。生产这么多的东西，崎岖山路咋个运法呀？他们便集中力量，突击三个昼夜，新修起一条长达十八公里的高山公路，由九里岗蜿蜒直达老翻山堰。
    今年秋后，他们又高举治山治水治土的大红旗，大干一个多月，到11月中旬止，全管理区已修成盘山长渠（干渠）十二条、支渠九十多条，改成梯田八千多亩、梯地七千多亩。
    从解放到今年，十年间全管理区粮食年产量增长了十二倍。社员们的经济收入，也由解放初期平均每人十七元多，激增至一百四十多元。历史上缺吃少穿的“穷山沟”，如今变成了丰衣足食，“山乡乐园”。（附图片）
