    Golden Rice Beside New Village
    You must deeply miss the Dongjiang area, which was flooded this summer. How are the people there living now? If you have seen the long documentary "Man Will Conquer Nature," you will have seen the heroic struggle of the people in the disaster area, under the leadership of the Party, against the floods. Now, go and see the great miracle created by Zengcheng County, one of the worst-hit areas, as depicted in Newsreel No. 68!
    The late rice of the Shitan People's Commune is ripe, and people are harvesting in the golden late rice fields. The joy of harvest shines on everyone's face. In the past four months, under the leadership of the Party, they overcame the flood and then overcame the drought that lasted for forty days without a drop of rain. Finally, they realized the bold assertion that "what the flood took away, we must take back!"
    The Xintang People's Commune, at the same time as the bumper harvest of late rice, also carried out the work of rebuilding their homes. Before the flood, the farmers lived in bungalows, but now they are constantly rebuilding their homes on the ruins destroyed by the flood, and the new buildings are all spacious and bright multi-story buildings. New buildings rise from the ground, and the new buildings welcome the commune members.
    The traces of disaster in Zengcheng County have been eliminated, and before us is a prosperous scene of golden rice beside new villages.

    金稻伴新村
    你一定十分怀念在今年夏天被洪水淹没过的东江地区，那里的人们如今生活得怎样了？如果你看过“人定胜天”这部长纪录片，你就能看到灾区人民在党的领导下，同洪水所作的英勇斗争。现在，你再去看看新闻简报六十八号中描写的重灾区之一、增城县所创造的伟大奇迹吧！
    石滩人民公社的晚稻成熟了，人们在黄金似的晚稻田里收割。丰收的喜悦，闪现在每一个人的脸上。四个月来，在党的领导下，他们战胜了水灾，接着又战胜了四十天没有下一滴雨的旱灾。终于实现了“洪水夺去的，我们一定要夺回来！”的豪言壮语。
    新塘人民公社，就在晚稻大丰收的同时，还进行了重建家园的工作。水灾前，农民住的都是平房，现在他们不断在被洪水毁成的废墟上，重建家园，而且新建的都是宽敞、明亮的楼房。座座楼房平地起，新的楼房迎接了社员们。
    增城县灾害的痕迹被消灭了，眼前是一幅金稻伴新村的兴旺景象。
