　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 18th December - Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, delivered a speech at the National Rural Cultural Work Conference held in Tirana on the 16th.

　　Speaking of the international situation, Hoxha said that the socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, has always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems. Only imperialism does not want peace. The imperialists, headed by US imperialism, began "Cold War" activities as soon as the Second World War ended, supporting German revanchists, establishing aggressive military blocs, engaging in an arms race, and building military bases.

　　Hoxha said that while the imperialists deceptively talk about so-called "peaceful coexistence," they are doing something else. This cannot deceive anyone. Speaking of the fact that the United States is still unwilling to establish normal diplomatic relations with Albania, Hoxha said that this does not matter to us at all. Whether the United States wants to establish normal relations with our country or not, we have existed in the past, exist now, and will always exist and live well in the future. The United States makes shameful statements every year through the State Department against the freedom and sovereignty of Albania. We have long been accustomed to and unafraid of this provocation. The conspiracy of the US ruling class to return Albania to the slavery of them and their loyal servants will never be realized.

　　Hoxha said: For ten years, US imperialism has been conducting a shameless "Cold War" against glorious China, which has already achieved freedom, sovereignty, and is victoriously building socialism. Can this be regarded as peaceful coexistence?

　　Hoxha pointed out that the US imperialist bloc is doing its best to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate status in the United Nations organization, while stubbornly supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He said that during his travels in Asian and African countries, US President Eisenhower made countless provocations against glorious China, attempting to undermine China's enormous peaceful and progressive influence in these countries. However, such provocations against China were also used against the Soviet Union in the past, and the world has long been familiar with them. They have failed in the past and will fail again today.

　　Hoxha said that the provocations against China will suffer a shameful defeat because China is powerful, China is a member of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, and there is a flesh-and-blood connection between us. Great China is victoriously building socialism, and great China is under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong. The Chinese people and the Communist Party of China have fought against the heinous imperialism for decades, and have always maintained close ties with the Soviet Union and our people's democratic countries. The conspiracies of the imperialists and the Yugoslav revisionists can not only not harm great China, but also not harm little Albania.

　　Speaking of peaceful coexistence, Hoxha said that we do not confuse it with ideological coexistence. We will never give up propagating the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, will always expose the corruption and ugliness of imperialism and capitalism, and will always propagate the scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism. We will never make concessions in principle. Then, Hoxha exposed the Yugoslav revisionists who attempted to disguise themselves with the slogan of Marxism-Leninism.

　　Hoxha said that the Yugoslav revisionists understand peaceful coexistence as peaceful cohabitation with capitalist ideology, and open the door for capitalism to wedge into socialism. Their acceptance of dollar checks from US imperialism and their silence in the anti-imperialist struggle prove this. Moreover, they are constantly attacking the socialist camp, the socialist system, and the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They openly slander us as satellites of the Soviet Union, just as the US State Department said, and slander the Soviet Union as a cunning colonialist country.

　　Hoxha said that these incorrigible enemies of socialism should be constantly exposed, and these provocateurs should be thoroughly exposed. They have done everything bad to oppose our country and our party. But they have not succeeded. They should know that the united people and party of our country will never allow them to do whatever they want, and will always vigilantly defend the interests of the people, the party, and the socialist camp.

　　Regarding disarmament, Hoxha said that disarmament is the main issue for all countries and all peoples. He expressed support for the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, believing that this proposal is a new manifestation of the consistent desire of the Soviet Union, the entire socialist camp, and the people of all countries in the world for disarmament and for the establishment and maintenance of lasting peace throughout the world.

　　Speaking of Albania's relations with other countries, Hoxha pointed out that the Albanian government is willing to establish diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with all countries on the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs and respect for freedom, sovereignty, and rights.

　　Speaking of the domestic situation, Hoxha said that soon, the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party will convene a plenary session to discuss the implementation of the first four years of the second five-year plan and put forward the tasks for the last year. He said that in accordance with the tasks put forward by the Third Congress of the Labor Party, the planned industrial output value stipulated in the second five-year plan will be overfulfilled by 8%, the investment and capital construction plan will be overfulfilled by 37%, and the tasks in developing the transportation industry and improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people will also be overfulfilled.

　　In his speech, Hoxha also pointed out the great achievements Albania has made in cultural construction in rural areas.

### 霍查谴责美国敌视阿尔巴尼亚和中国  南斯拉夫修正主义者挑拨社会主义各国团结的阴谋一定失败  阿尔巴尼亚五年计划工业总产值计划将超额完成

　　霍查谴责美国敌视阿尔巴尼亚和中国
    南斯拉夫修正主义者挑拨社会主义各国团结的阴谋一定失败
    阿尔巴尼亚五年计划工业总产值计划将超额完成
    新华社地拉那18日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查，16日在地拉那召开的全国农村文化工作会议上发表了演说。
    在谈到国际形势时，霍查说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营一直主张政治社会制度不同的国家的和平共处。只有帝国主义才不要和平。以美国帝国主义为首的帝国主义者在第二次世界大战一结束就开始进行“冷战”活动，扶植德国复仇主义者，建立侵略性的军事集团，进行军备竞赛和建立军事基地。
    霍查说，当帝国主义者一方面蛊惑人心地谈论所谓“和平共处”时，另一方面却在干着另外的勾当。这是骗不了任何人的。霍查在谈到至今美国不愿同阿尔巴尼亚建立正常的外交关系时说，这对我们说来一点也没有关系，不管美国想不想和我国建立正常的关系，我们在过去、现在和将来永远存在着并且生活得很好。美国每年通过国务院作出反对阿尔巴尼亚自由和主权的可耻声明，对于这种挑衅我们早已习惯了，并且不害怕。美国统治阶级妄想使阿尔巴尼亚回到他们和他们忠诚的仆从的奴役下的阴谋是永远不会实现的。
    霍查说：十年来，美国帝国主义对已经取得自由、主权并正在胜利地建设社会主义的、光荣的中国，一直进行无耻的“冷战”，这难道能认为是和平共处吗？
    霍查指出，美国帝国主义集团竭力阻挠恢复中国在联合国组织中的合法地位，而顽固地支持蒋介石集团。他说，美国总统艾森豪威尔在亚非国家旅行时对光荣的中国进行了无数次的挑衅，企图损伤中国在这些国家中所起的和平和进步的巨大影响。但是，对中国进行的这种挑衅过去也曾被用来反对过苏联，世界上早就熟悉了。他们过去曾遭到失败，今天仍将遭到失败。
    霍查说，对中国进行的挑衅将遭到可耻的失败，因为，中国是强大的，中国是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的一员，我们之间有着骨肉似的联系。伟大的中国正在胜利地建设社会主义，伟大的中国是在以毛泽东为首的光荣的共产党领导下的。中国人民和中国共产党几十年来曾经跟万恶的帝国主义进行过斗争，忠实地跟苏联和我们人民民主国家有着紧密的联系。帝国主义者和南斯拉夫修正主义者的阴谋不仅损害不了伟大的中国，而且也损害不了小小的阿尔巴尼亚。
    在谈到和平共处时，霍查说，我们并不把它和思想共处相混淆起来。我们绝不放弃宣传社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性，永远要揭露帝国主义和资本主义的腐朽和丑恶，并且永远要宣传马克思列宁主义这一科学的真理。我们永远不会作原则上的让步。接着，霍查揭露了企图以马克思列宁主义口号伪装起来的南斯拉夫修正主义者。
    霍查说，南斯拉夫修正主义者把和平共处理解为同资本主义思想的和平共居，并为资本主义楔入社会主义打开大门。他们从美帝国主义那里取得美元支票和他们在反帝国主义斗争中保持沉默，都证明了这一点。不但如此，他们无时无刻不在向社会主义阵营、社会主义制度和以苏联共产党为首的各国共产党和工人党进攻。他们公开地诬蔑我们是苏联的卫星国，就像美国国务院所说的那样，诬蔑苏联是一个狡猾的殖民主义国家。
    霍查说，应当不断地揭露这些执迷不悟的、社会主义的敌人，应当彻底揭露这些挑拨者。他们做尽坏事，反对我国和我们的党。但是，他们都没有成功。他们应当知道，团结一致的我国人民和党永远不会让他们为所欲为，永远警惕地保卫着人民、党和社会主义阵营的利益。
    关于裁军问题，霍查说，裁军是各国人民和各国的主要问题。他表示支持苏联政府关于全面和彻底的裁军建议，认为这项建议是苏联、整个社会主义阵营和世界各国人民一贯渴望裁军、渴望建立和维护全世界的持久和平的新表现。
    在谈到阿尔巴尼亚同其他国家的关系时，霍查指出，阿尔巴尼亚政府愿意本着彼此不干涉内政、尊重自由、主权和权利的原则同一切国家建立外交、经济和文化关系。
    在谈到国内形势时，霍查说，不久，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会将召开全体会议来讨论第二个五年计划头四年的执行情况，并提出最后一年的任务。他说，按照劳动党第三次代表大会提出的任务，第二个五年计划规定的工业总产值计划将超额8％完成，投资和基本建设计划将超额37％完成，在发展运输业和提高劳动人民的物质文化生活水平方面的任务，也将超额完成。
    霍查在演说中还指出了阿尔巴尼亚农村在文化建设方面获得的巨大成就。
