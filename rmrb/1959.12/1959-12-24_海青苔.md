　　Sea Green Algae
　　Its growth and reproduction are very fast. After harvesting, even if only three to seven centimeters of the base remain, it can grow to one to two meters in four or five days. The growing season is from December to June of the following year, with the peak growth period being from January to February.

　　Wash the freshly harvested sea green algae to remove impurities, and cut it into six to nine centimeter lengths. In summer, it can be mixed with cold water or swill for fresh feeding; in winter, it should be mixed with warm rice water, swill, or hot water, or slightly cooked in a pot, and then mixed with other feed to feed the pigs. If it is dried sea green algae, cut it short, knead it into a fine powder, mix it with other feed, and cook it before feeding it to the pigs. (Attached picture)

　　海青苔
    它的生长繁殖很快，经采集后，基部虽只留下三到七厘米，但过四五天后又能长到一到二米。生长期在12月到翌年6月之间，1到2月为生长盛期。
    把捞来的鲜海青苔洗净去杂，切成六到九厘米长，夏天可用冷水或泔水拌和鲜喂；冬天要用温热的米汤、泔水或热水冲，或放在锅中稍微煮熟，然后拌和其他饲料喂猪。如果是晒干的海青苔，则切短揉成细末，混合其他饲料煮熟喂猪，（附图片）
