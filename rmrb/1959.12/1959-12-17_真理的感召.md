The National Exhibition of Labor Reform of Criminals, sponsored by the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China, recently closed. The great achievements of the ten years of labor reform work in New China, as shown in this exhibition, have been warmly praised by Chinese and foreign personages, who generally believe that this is a "miracle" in social reform work and a manifestation of great revolutionary humanitarianism. The emergence of this "miracle" is only possible under the socialist system. Many foreign friends have also pointed out that seeing these achievements in China has brought to light all the slanders of imperialism against China's labor reform of criminals.

Since its official opening on October 2, the exhibition has attracted hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life in China and visitors from more than forty countries. This exhibition reflects the correctness of the Chinese Communist Party's policy of labor reform of criminals and its brilliant achievements. The exhibition tells people that through labor reform and a series of education for criminals, many criminals have turned over a new leaf. A large number of vivid examples show that their mental outlook has changed after reform. Many people who used to live a parasitic life are now able to support themselves and have developed the habit of labor; some counter-revolutionary criminals are now able to stand on the side of the people and help the government expose other hidden counter-revolutionary elements; former habitual thieves and pickpockets are now able to return lost money; and bandits who used to commit crimes are now able to show courage and sacrifice themselves to save others. The exhibition materials also indicate that after reform, most criminals can gradually become useful people. For example, according to the statistics of nine labor reform units, 61.3% of the criminals who originally had no production skills have now learned general techniques; according to the statistics of twenty-five labor reform units, more than 68% of the criminals who were originally illiterate have now shed their illiteracy. These vivid facts have aroused great interest among Chinese and foreign visitors, and many foreign visitors have requested to make the exhibition into a film or photograph to take back to their country as a precious gift.

After visiting the exhibition, many democratic人士parties enthusiastically hailed the victory of the Party's policy of labor reform of criminals. They said: It's great, labor reform work is really not simple, it not only prevents criminals from living idly, but also turns ghosts into people. A well-known overseas Chinese who returned to China for sightseeing wrote at the exhibition: "Visiting the exhibition has further deepened my understanding of the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and the great achievements of the labor reform policy, and I have learned about the true stories of turning ghosts into people. This is a true manifestation of revolutionary humanitarianism, which cannot be achieved in capitalist countries. Overseas Chinese compatriots feel the same glory and pride."

Residents of the capital were very excited after the visit, believing that many bad people have turned into good people after reform, which is a sign of social progress in New China. Yuan Zhiyi, a resident of Beijing Street, said excitedly after visiting the exhibition, "I really didn't expect that the exhibits were produced by criminals. The same two hands created countless disasters for the people in the old society; in the new society, they have done things that are beneficial to the people. I hail the victory of the Party's labor reform policy." An elderly man in his seventies in the capital was moved after watching the exhibition and said: "This is a great reform undertaking that has never happened before. It can only appear under the leadership of the Communist Party. I want to shout long live the Chinese Communist Party, long live Chairman Mao for the achievements of labor reform!"

Some family members of criminals, people who have been released after serving their sentences, and rightists were also deeply moved after the visit. Wu Fufeng from a technical training class in Beijing wrote: "My father is a counter-revolutionary criminal and is undergoing labor reform. The visit has given me a great education. I will definitely write a letter to encourage my father to accept reform well." Zhang Yanqiu, who was released early due to good performance in labor reform and is now working on Beijing Street, wrote more than 2,000 words in the comments book, expressing his gratitude to the government for his reform. He said: I don't know how many sinful people like me have been saved by the Party and the government. In the future, I will use my meager strength to repay the Party and the government. An unnamed rightist left a message after the visit: "I once opposed the Party's anti-counter-revolutionary policy. After the visit, I have a further understanding of my crimes. The exhibition tells me that labor reform is not simply punishment, it is creating new people. I deeply feel that the socialist system guarantees the self-renewal of bad people, and there are saving hands everywhere." A person who called himself a "sinner" wrote such a poem: "The ancients喻compared rotten wood to be不可unable to be carved, but today's criminals are reformed. Political and economic harvests are abundant, everything is used to its fullest and people become better. There has never been such a miracle in history, all due to the leadership of the Party, I am moved to tears and determined to correct evil and return to the right path."

Many foreign friends who visited the exhibition on labor reform of criminals believed that it was an eye-opener and saw a "miracle." Pritt, Chairman of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and his wife said during their visit to the exhibition that this vivid exhibition attracted us and completely clarified the rumors and slanders of Western countries against you. Pritt enthusiastically left a message at the exhibition: "I sincerely admire everything displayed in this exhibition. It embodies great humanitarianism and socialist construction work. The construction you have carried out over the years, including the great work of transforming anti-socialist elements into good citizens, these achievements should indeed be highly praised." Lu Bistriski, secretary of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, said: "Being able to transform a bad person into a good person and let him embark on the right path and live a good life embodies the humanitarianism of socialism." He also said: "It is best to let the imperialists also take a look, because this will be a powerful rebuttal to their defamation."

Reiner Bloom, chairman of the Luxembourg-China Friendship Association who had previously served as the Minister of Justice of Luxembourg, watched the exhibition very carefully. Especially when he saw the examples of bandits reporting bandits and saw that criminals had learned technology, some of whom had reached the level of engineers and technicians, he was even more amazed, believing that the effect of this reform was "very amazing." Bloom became more and more excited as he watched. Finally, he delivered a speech to the staff and visitors in the exhibition hall. He said: "I have seen so many things today that I could not have imagined in the past. When I walked out of this exhibition hall, I felt like I was still in a dream. I saw that these criminals cannot be reformed in capitalist countries, but you have created so many miracles in your country!" He continued: "The only explanation for why you have achieved these achievements is that I have not only seen the great construction achievements of your country, but also how your country is doing the work of transforming people."

Many foreign visitors, when visiting, compared the dark situation of prisons in capitalist countries. Amir Okri, deputy head of the Iraqi People's Delegation, said: It is impossible to reform criminals in capitalist countries. The contradictions between their prisons and prisoners cannot be resolved, but you are unique in this regard. Your prisons are like factories and schools. Dr. Viniata of the New Zealand-China Friendship Association delegation said: "Capitalist countries treat criminals like pigs and lock them up, while your places for reforming criminals are like hospitals, where many bad people have been treated. This is the most just and humane way to treat criminals." Some foreign friends, when they saw that the counter-revolutionary criminal Wang Lun learned architectural design in the reform and has reached the level of an engineer, and also saw many vivid facts such as many former thieves being able to return lost money after labor reform, said with satisfaction: "It is the most difficult thing in the world to reform criminals, but China has solved this problem."

    真理的感召
    新华社记者　赵立森
    中华人民共和国公安部举办的全国劳动改造罪犯工作展览会最近闭幕。这个展览会所显示的新中国十年来劳动改造罪犯工作的伟大成绩，受到了中外人士热烈的赞扬，他们普遍认为这是社会改造工作中的“奇迹”，是伟大的革命人道主义的表现，出现这种“奇迹”只有在社会主义制度下才有可能。许多外国朋友们并且指出，看到了中国的这些成就，使帝国主义对中国劳动改造罪犯工作的一切诬蔑都真相大白。
    展览会从10月2日正式开幕以来，吸引了国内各阶层数十万人以及四十多个国家的来宾前往参观。这个展览会反映了中国共产党劳动改造罪犯政策的正确，及其所取得的辉煌成果。展览会告诉人们，通过对罪犯进行劳动改造和一系列的教育，有不少犯人已经改恶从善。大量生动的事例说明他们经过改造以后精神面貌有了改变，许多长期过寄生生活的人，现在能够自食其力，养成劳动习惯；有些反革命罪犯，现在能够站到人民立场上帮助政府揭露其他暗藏的反革命分子；过去的惯盗惯窃分子现在能够拾金不昧；过去是行凶作恶的土匪，现在能够见义勇为，舍己救人。展览的材料还指明，犯人们经过改造，多数人都能逐渐变成有用的人，例如根据九个劳改单位的统计，原来没有一点生产本领而现在已学会一般技术的犯人占61.3％；据二十五个劳改单位的统计，原来是文盲的犯人，现在已有68％以上摘掉文盲帽子。这些生动的事实，引起了中外来宾极大的兴趣，许多外宾并且要求把展览会拍成电影或照片，当作珍贵的礼物带回国内。
    许多党派民主人士参观以后，热烈地欢呼党的劳动改造罪犯政策的胜利，他们说：好极了，劳动改造工作真不简单，不但使罪犯没有坐吃闲饭，而且把鬼变成了人。一位归国观光的华侨著名人士在展览会上写道：“参观展览会进一步体会了党和毛主席的正确领导和劳动改造政策的伟大成就，了解了把鬼变人的真正事迹。这是真正革命人道主义精神的表现，是资本主义国家无法做到的，海外侨胞同感光荣与骄傲。”
    首都的居民参观以后都非常兴奋，认为许多坏人经过改造变成好人，这是新中国社会进步的一个标志。北京街道居民袁志一参观以后兴奋地说，“我看了展览品真想不到是犯人生产的，同样两只手，在旧社会给人民造下数不清的灾难；在新社会就作出了对人民有利的事情。我欢呼党的劳改政策的胜利。”首都有一位七十多岁的老人看了展览会以后感动地说：“这是千古没有的伟大改造事业，只有在共产党领导下才能出现，我要为劳动改造的成绩高呼中国共产党万岁，毛主席万岁！”
    一些犯人家属、已刑满释放的人和右派分子，参观后也深受感动。北京一个技术训练班的武福逢写道：“我的父亲是个反革命犯，正在劳动改造，参观后使我受到很大教育，我回去一定写信鼓励我的父亲好好接受改造”。由于劳动改造表现好而提前释放、现在北京街道工作的张雁秋参观后，在意见簿上写了二千多字，表示感激政府对他的改造，他说：不知道党和政府挽救了多少像我这样有罪的人，今后我要用我这一生微薄的力量来报答党和政府的恩情。一个未署名的右派分子参观后留言道：“我曾反对过党的肃反政策，参观后对我的罪行有了进一步的认识。展览会告诉我，劳动改造不是单纯的惩办，它是在创造新人。我深深感到社会主义制度保证了坏人自新，到处都有挽救的手。”一位自称为“罪人”的人，写了这样一首诗：“古喻朽木不可雕，今日罪犯竟改造，政治经济双丰收，物尽其用人变好。亘古未有此奇迹，诸因皆由党领导，感此不禁泪双流，决心改邪归正道。”
    许多外国朋友参观了劳动改造罪犯工作展览会以后，都认为是大开眼界，见到了“奇迹”。国际民主法律工作者协会主席普里特和他的夫人在参观这个展览会时说，这个生动的展出把我们吸引住了，展览会完全澄清了西方国家对你们的造谣和诬蔑。普里特在展览会上热情地留言：“我衷心地钦佩这个展览会上所展出的一切，它体现出伟大的人道主义和社会主义建设工作。你们多年来所进行的建设，包括了把反社会主义分子改造成善良公民的这一伟大工作，这些成就的确应当得到很高的评价。”国际民主法律工作者协会书记鲁·比斯特里斯基说：“能够把一个坏人改造为好人，让他走上正路，好好生活，这就体现了社会主义的人道主义。”他还说：“最好让帝国主义者也来看一看，因为这对他们的诽谤将是一个有力的反驳”。
    过去曾任过卢森堡司法部长的卢中友好协会主席雷纳·布鲁姆在展览会上看的很仔细，特别当他看到土匪检举土匪的事例，看到犯人学会技术，有的已达到相当工程师、技术员的水平时，更是感叹不已，认为这种改造的效果“是非常惊人的”。布鲁姆越看越兴奋，他最后在展览馆里向工作人员和观众发表了讲话，他说：“我今天看到了这样多的东西，是过去不能想像的，当我走出这个展览会时，我好像还在梦境中。看到了这些罪犯在资本主义国家里是不可改造的，而在你们国家里却创造了这样多的奇迹！”他接着说：“你们之所以取得这些成就，对我来说只有一个解释，这就是不仅使我看到了你们国家的伟大建设成就，而且也看到了你们国家怎样作改造人的工作。”
    许多外宾在参观时，对比了资本主义国家监狱的黑暗情况。伊拉克人民代表团副团长阿密尔·奥克里说：改造罪犯在资本主义国家是无能为力的，他们的监狱和犯人之间的矛盾不可能解决，而你们在这方面是独特的，你们的监狱同工厂学校一样。新西兰新中友协代表团维尼亚塔博士说：“资本主义国家对待犯人像对待猪一样把他关起来，而你们改造犯人的地方像个医院，使许多坏人在这里得到了治疗，这样对待犯人是最公正最人道的。”有些外国朋友，当他们看到反革命犯王仑在改造中学会建筑设计，并且已经达到工程师水平的时候，又看到很多过去是盗窃犯，经过劳动改造以后能拾金不昧等生动的事实以后，满意地说：“改造犯人在世界上是最难的，但在中国已经解决了这个问题。”
