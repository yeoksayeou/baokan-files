    Variety Simplified, Efficacy Increased:
    Santai County Continuously Improves Quality of Indigenous Pesticides
    Fifty Types Reach High-Efficiency Pesticide Standards After Scientific Evaluation
    Chengdu, 11th (People's Daily) - On the basis of last year's significant development of indigenous pesticides, Santai County, Sichuan, has adopted a policy of combining popularization with improvement this year, continuing to adhere to large-scale small indigenous groups, while strengthening scientific research to continuously improve pesticide quality.
    Santai County won the title of National Red Flag County for indigenous pesticide production last year. During the Great Leap Forward, the people of the county built more than 3,000 indigenous pesticide factories, producing large quantities of indigenous pesticides, which played an active role in preventing and controlling insect pests in crops such as rice and cotton. After consolidation, more than 1,100 indigenous pesticide factories remain in the county. Since the beginning of this year, they have produced more than 90 million jin of indigenous pesticides, enabling the county's summer and autumn crops, such as wheat, rapeseed, rice, sweet potatoes, and cotton, to undergo one to eight rounds of prevention and control, effectively combating pests and diseases. The thorough prevention, control and elimination of rice stem borers on 300,000 mu of rice fields using indigenous pesticides alone recovered 15 million jin of grain from pests, enough to feed the county's one million people for half a month.
    From the beginning of this year, Santai County attached importance to improving the quality of indigenous pesticides, following the spirit of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" to simplify varieties, increase efficacy, and continuously expand the effectiveness of preventing and controlling pests and diseases. Research institutions were successively established from the county to the communes. Focusing on rice and corn stem borers, rice blast, sweet potato tortoise beetle, cotton aphids, spider mites, red bollworms, and fusarium wilt, which have seriously harmed local crops over the years, extensive use was made of local wild herbs and mineral raw materials for prevention and control experiments, followed by batch manufacturing. According to measurements by the Santai Working Group of the Sichuan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, fifty types of indigenous pesticides produced in the county have reached the standards of high-efficiency pesticides.
    In mobilizing the masses to engage in indigenous pesticides production, Santai County summarized experiences and collected samples from the bottom up, and organized promotion from the top down, testing each type discovered and promoting each type that succeeded. In collecting and treating medicinal herbs, they fully relied on social forces such as experienced farmers, herbal medicine doctors, and doctors of traditional Chinese medicine to continuously discover new pesticides. At five symposiums of herbal medicine doctors held in Anju District, more than thirty new folk herbal insect control formulas were obtained, and the experimental results were very good.
    In order to expand the source of raw materials, Santai County adopted measures such as picking and protecting, picking large and leaving small, picking leaves and stems and leaving roots, and picking part and leaving part, when organizing the masses to collect wild pesticide plants; at the same time, for some plant pesticides that are highly effective but not easy to collect, the masses were mobilized to use idle land around fields, houses, hillsides and forests for cultivation, turning wild plants into domesticated plants.

    品种由繁到简　药效由低到高
    三台县不断提高土农药质量
    经过科学鉴定五十种达到高效农药标准
    本报成都11日电　四川三台县在去年土农药大发展的基础上，今年采取普及与提高相结合的方针，继续坚持大搞小土群，同时加强科学研究工作，不断提高农药质量。
    三台县去年曾荣获全国土农药生产红旗县的称号。全县人民在大跃进中，兴建了三千多个土农药厂，制出大批土农药，对防治水稻、棉花等作物的虫害，起了积极作用。全县土农药厂经过整顿巩固，尚有一千一百多个，今年以来，已生产土农药九千多万斤，使全县小麦、油菜、水稻、红苕、棉花等夏秋两熟作物，都普遍经过一次到八次的防治，有效地打击了病虫害。仅以使用土农药彻底防治和杀灭三十万亩水稻螟虫，就从害虫口中夺回了一千五百万斤粮食，可供全县百万人民半月食用。
    三台县今年一开始，就重视提高土农药的质量，本着“土洋结合”的精神，使品种由繁到简、药效由低到高，不断扩大防治病虫害的效果。从县到公社都相继成立了研究机构，针对历年危害本地农作物严重的水稻、玉米螟虫、稻瘟病、红苕金花虫、棉花蚜虫、红蜘蛛、红蛉虫、枯萎病等，广泛利用本地野生草药和矿物性原料进行防治试验，然后成批制造。经中国科学院四川分院三台工作组测定，这个县生产的土农药中，有五十种达到了高效农药的标准。
    三台县在发动群众大搞土农药中，由下而上的总结经验，搜集样品；由上而下的组织推广，发现一种试验一种，成功一种推广一种。他们在采药治药中，充分依靠老农、草药医生、中医师等社会力量，不断发掘新农药。在安居区召开的五次草药医生座谈会上，就获得了三十多种民间草药治虫的新配方，经过试验效果都很好。
    为了扩大原料来源，三台县在组织群众采集野生农药植物时，采取了既采摘又保护，采大留小，采叶茎留根子，采部分留部分等办法；同时对一些效力大，而又不易采到的植物农药，则发动群众利用田边地角、房屋周围、山坡树林等空闲地进行栽培，变野生为家种。
