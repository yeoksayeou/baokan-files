Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: Party organizations in Beijing's factories, mines, enterprises, construction, and transportation departments have strengthened Party building work amidst the excellent situation of continued leaps forward this year. From January to November, they admitted a total of 12,100 outstanding individuals into the Party.

Among this batch of newly admitted probationary Party members, advanced producers and Red Banner holders from the working class accounted for a large proportion. Among the 1,321 new Party members developed in nine factories, mines, and construction departments, 707 were advanced producers or Red Banner holders. They have all undergone the long-term cultivation and education of the Party and the test of various movements, possess a high level of communist consciousness, study diligently and assiduously in production and various tasks, dare to think and dare to act; and can use their exemplary actions to motivate and unite the masses, overcome difficulties, and excellently complete the various tasks assigned by the Party. For example, Ma Xiaoliu, a steelmaking worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's Experimental Plant, goes wherever there are difficulties. Once, the tuyere of a converter was blocked by molten iron and slag, and steelmaking was about to stop. At this time, he immediately climbed onto the converter, which was at a temperature of about 200 degrees Celsius, to rush to repair it. Under his influence, three furnace workers also climbed onto the furnace to participate in the rush repair, which ensured the smooth progress of steelmaking. Ma Xiaoliu has been rated as an advanced producer and Red Banner holder of the entire company for three consecutive times. Not long ago, he was admitted to the Communist Party. Wang Xueli, the captain of the carpentry youth shock team of the Second Construction Site of the Fifth Engineering Department of the Beijing Sixth Construction Engineering Company, and a new Party member, overcame various difficulties with the masses, created and improved more than a dozen advanced operating methods, and put forward more than 20 major rationalization proposals. In order to save raw materials, he often led his team members to find old materials several miles away. Over the past six years, they have saved the country more than 1,400 cubic meters of wood and 19 tons of nails, worth more than 122,000 yuan. The shock team he led won the honorary titles of model team and youth Red Banner team of the entire company and Beijing, and Wang Xueli also represented the entire team at the National Conference of Heroes. Liu Yajun, a lathe operator and new Party member from the Changxindian Communications Factory who attended the National Conference of Heroes, not only took the lead in everything during the Great Leap Forward, but also spread his experience to others to help them leap forward together. Once, when Liu Yajun was making "plug" parts, he increased the output from more than 400 to 700 per day by using a multi-tool, multi-blade method. Later, she introduced her experience to lathe operator Wen Yuzhen, who surpassed Liu Yajun with a score of 760 pieces per day. Peng Houzhi, a conductor from the Third Trolley Team of the Beijing Trolley Company, who attended the National Conference of Heroes, has always loved his work, is considerate to passengers, wins the praise of passengers, has become the "service pacesetter" of the entire factory, and has won the honorary titles of Red Banner holder of the city and National Youth Socialist Construction Activist. He also helped others to leap forward together. Six conductors were rated as "Red Banner holders" of the Third Team with his help.

Before admitting these outstanding individuals into the Party, the Party organizations of various units conducted a series of training and education work for them. For example, they held training classes for activists or absorbed them to listen to Party lectures, educated them on basic Party knowledge, helped them improve their awareness, and assigned them to complete complex and arduous tasks, so that they could be trained in actual work. After being approved to join the Party, this group of activists became even more enthusiastic and played their due role in production.

　　北京万余优秀工人入党
    先进生产者和红旗手占很大比例
    新华社22日讯　北京市厂矿企业、建筑和交通运输部门的党组织，在今年继续跃进的大好形势中，加强了建党工作，从1月至11月共接收了一万二千一百多名优秀分子入党。
    这批新接收的预备党员中，工人阶级中的先进生产者和红旗手占了很大的比例。在九个厂矿、建筑部门新发展的一千三百二十一名党员中，就有七百零七人是先进生产者或红旗手。他们都经过党的长期培养教育和各项运动的考验，具有较高的共产主义觉悟，在生产和各项工作中勤学苦钻，敢想敢干；并能以自己的模范行动带动和团结群众，克服困难，出色地完成党所交给的各项任务。例如石景山钢铁公司试验厂炼钢工人马小六，哪里有困难就到哪里去。有一次，转炉的风眼被铁水和渣子堵塞了，眼看炼钢就要停下来。这时他立即爬到温度在二百度左右的转炉上去抢修，在他的影响下，三个炉前工也爬上炉子参加抢修，结果保证了炼钢的顺利进行。马小六曾连续三次被评为全公司的先进生产者和红旗手，不久以前他被接收参加了共产党。北京市第六建筑工程公司第五工程处第二工地木工青年突击队队长、新党员王学礼，同群众一起克服各种困难，创造和改进了十几种先进操作方法，并提出二十多项重大的合理化建议。为了节约原料材料，他常常带领队员跑到几里以外地方找旧料，六年来他们为国家节省木材一千四百多立方米，钉子十九吨，价值十二万二千多元。他领导的这支突击队，获得了全公司和北京市的模范队和青年红旗队的光荣称号，王学礼并曾经代表全队出席了全国群英会。曾出席全国群英会的长辛店通信工厂车工、新党员刘雅君，不但自己在大跃进中事事打先锋，并把自己的经验传播给别人，帮助别人共同跃进。有一次，刘雅君在做“塞孔”零件时，由于采用了多刀多刃的办法，从原来一天做四百多个提高到七百个。后来她把自己的经验介绍给车工温玉珍，温玉珍以一天做七百六十个的成绩超过了刘雅君。曾出席全国群英会的北京电车公司无轨厂第三车队售票员、新党员彭厚芝，一贯热爱自己的工作，对乘客体贴入微，博得乘客的赞扬，成为全厂的“服务标兵”，并获得了全市红旗手和全国青年社会主义建设积极分子的光荣称号。他并帮助别人共同跃进，先后有六个售票员在他的帮助下被评为第三车队的“红旗手”。
    各单位党组织在接收这批优秀分子入党以前，都对他们进行了一系列的培养和教育工作。如开办积极分子训练班或吸收他们听党课，对他们进行党的基本知识的教育，帮助他们提高觉悟，并分配他们去完成复杂艰巨的任务，使他们在实际工作中得到锻炼。这批积极分子在被批准入党以后，积极性更加高涨，在生产中起到了应有的作用。
