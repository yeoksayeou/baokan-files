Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 9th: Recently, many industrial and mining enterprises in Poland have reported the good news of completing this year's production plans ahead of schedule.

The performance of mining industry workers in completing the plan this year is very outstanding. The first to victoriously enter 1960 were the miners of the "Słupiec" coal mine. They completed this year's coal mining plan two months ahead of schedule. By the end of this year, the miners of this coal mine will have overproduced 70,000 tons of coal. Following them, the workers of the "Mysłowice" coal mine completed this year's coal mining plan one month and ten days ahead of schedule, and by the end of the year, they will increase production by 150,000 tons of coal.

The workers of the Nowy Kościół copper mine not only completed the annual plan forty days ahead of schedule but also made labor productivity exceed that of all enterprises in the mining sector. At the same time, the production cost per ton of copper ore was reduced by 20 złoty (Polish currency) compared to last year.

The lignite mining plan was also completed more than a month ahead of schedule. By the end of the year, lignite mines will overproduce 900,000 tons of lignite, which is 1.7 million tons more than last year.

In the metallurgical industry, the workers of the Dąbrowa Metallurgical Plant completed 102.9% of this year's commodity production plan forty-five days ahead of schedule, an increase of 27.7% compared to the same period last year. Labor productivity per person reached 114.3% of the planned target, an increase of 38.9% compared to last year.

Poland's achievements in production this year are due to the significant improvement in labor productivity in various sectors and the continuously rising labor enthusiasm of workers in various regions. Currently, the workers of industrial and mining enterprises that have already completed this year's full-year production plans are continuing their efforts to produce more wealth for the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 9th: Many factories and mining enterprises throughout Czechoslovakia have completed their production targets for this year ahead of schedule.

The Stalin Coal Mine in the most important Ostrava-Karviná coal region in the country completed its annual target on November 20th. This is the result of effective organization and the widespread development of socialist competition, especially the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team."

After successfully completing this year's targets, the workers of the Bratislava power plant will produce another 40 million kilowatt-hours of electricity by the end of the year.

In terms of capital construction, the workers building new mines in the Bohemian lignite mining area have completed the plan approximately forty days ahead of schedule. The workers in the Ostrava coal mining area have also completed the annual tasks in establishing new mines and renovating existing mines.

Housing construction workers have made particularly great efforts to complete the plan ahead of schedule this year. The Pilsen Construction Company and the construction workers of Ostrava have completed the annual construction plan two months ahead of schedule. A new factory for producing building materials in Slovakia was put into production in early November, a full year ahead of the original plan.

In agriculture, there is also frequent good news about completing plans ahead of schedule. This year, all regions of the country completed the poultry procurement task two months ahead of schedule, which is the highest record since the war. Great progress has also been made in soil improvement work, with the Slovak region exceeding the annual task by more than 10%.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 8th: In the vigorous socialist labor competition, many factories and enterprises in Romania have recently completed this year's production targets ahead of schedule, creating excellent savings achievements, and entering 1960 ahead of time.

The No. 2 Coal and Iron Workshop of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine completed its full-year production plan on the 2nd and improved the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace by 8.55% compared to the original plan. The workers saved 14.65 million lei (Romanian currency) by reducing production costs. The ironmaking workers of the Reşiţa Metallurgical Combine completed the full-year production task thirty-five days ahead of schedule. This year, they improved the loading and smelting work, increasing the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace by 10.68% compared to the original plan. The Roman steel pipe factory also completed the full-year plan one month ahead of schedule, saving raw materials and reducing production costs by 19.65 million lei, and overproducing 15,900 tons of steel pipes.

The country's largest Jiu Valley coal mine saved more than 15.8 million lei in the first ten months of this year by increasing labor productivity and reducing production costs and overproduced more than 19,700 tons of coal in November.

Currently, good news about completing full-year production plans and savings plans ahead of schedule continues to pour in, and workers will bid farewell to 1959 with greater production achievements.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 9th: The broad masses of workers on the Bulgarian industrial front are currently fighting hard to complete and exceed this year's production plans ahead of schedule. Recently, good news has been continuously coming from the industrial production front throughout the country that workers have entered 1960 ahead of time.

By November 26th, 1,134 youth production teams nationwide had entered 1960 ahead of schedule. By the end of the year, they will have overproduced products worth more than 388.8 million leva (Bulgarian currency) for the country. Industrial enterprises in Levski Grad, Plovdiv Oblast, completed all indicators of this year's production plan two months ahead of schedule. By the end of the year, they will overproduce products equivalent to 1.35 million leva.

In the mining and metallurgical industries, the "Roshen" copper mine in Burgas Oblast completed this year's production plan thirty-nine days ahead of schedule. The "Mir" branch of the Lenin Metallurgical Plant in Dimitrovgrad completed this year's production plan forty-five days ahead of schedule. The workers of this factory found methods and tapped potentials, greatly increasing production without adding new equipment. The steel rolled in the first ten and a half months of this year alone reached 33,000 tons, which is ten times more than the annual output in 1948.

In the power industry, the workers of the country's largest thermal power plant, the "Stalin" power plant, began producing next year's products on December 1st.

The workers on the capital construction front are not lagging behind either. The workers of the construction department in Kazanlak, Stara Zagora Oblast, completed this year's plan forty days ahead of schedule, building a total of forty-two capital construction projects.

The main reason why many industrial and mining enterprises in Bulgaria have completed their production plans far ahead of schedule this year is that the Bulgarian Communist Party organizations at all levels and mass organizations have used various forms to conduct political and ideological work extensively and deeply, and to carry out rationalization proposal movements and labor competitions. Three thousand six hundred and thirty-six youth production teams in Bulgaria participated in the competition to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule. 98% of the workers in industrial enterprises in Plovdiv participated in the competition to exceed labor quotas and strive to produce high-quality products. They put forward the slogan "Complete the Second Five-Year Plan in three years and four months." The workers of industrial enterprises in Sofia, which account for about one-quarter of Bulgaria's total industrial output value, carried out rationalization proposal activities in order to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule. In the first nine months of this year alone, they put forward about 8,000 rationalization proposals, of which 2,100 have been adopted, saving the country 21,217,000 leva. The rationalization proposal movements in the machine-building, metallurgy, and power industries have also achieved great results. (Attached picture)

    劳动竞赛加速生产发展　技术革新提高生产效率
    波捷罗保许多企业提前完成年计划
    波兰
    据新华社华沙9日电　最近以来，波兰许多工矿企业纷纷传来提前完成今年生产计划的捷报。
    采矿工业的职工今年完成计划的情况非常出色。首先传来胜利进入1960年的是“斯卢皮奇”煤矿的矿工。他们提前两个月完成了今年的采煤计划。到今年年底止，这座煤矿的矿工们将超计划开采七万吨煤。接着，“梅斯洛维茨”煤矿的职工们提前一个月零十天完成了今年的采煤计划，到年底，他们将增产十五万吨煤。
    诺维科希奥耳铜矿的职工不但提前四十天完成了年度计划，并且使劳动生产率超过了采矿部门的所有企业。同时，使每吨铜矿石的生产成本比去年降低了二十个兹罗提（波币）。
    褐煤开采计划也提前一个多月完成了今年计划。到年底，褐煤矿井将超计划开采褐煤九十万吨，即比去年多开采一百七十万吨。
    在冶金工业中，达巴尔冶金厂的职工们，提前四十五天完成了今年的商品生产计划的102.9％，比去年同期增加了27.7％，每个人的劳动生产率达到了计划规定的114.3％，比去年增长了38.9％。
    波兰今年在生产上所以取得这样的成就，是由于各部门的劳动生产率有很大的提高，以及各地职工的劳动热情不断高涨。目前，已经完成今年全年生产计划的工矿企业的职工们正在继续努力，为国家增产更多的财富而奋斗。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    据新华社布拉格9日电　捷克斯洛伐克全国各地已有许多厂矿企业提前完成了今年的生产指标。
    在全国最重要的俄斯特拉发—卡尔维那煤区的斯大林煤矿已经在11月20日完成了全年的指标。这是由于有效的组织工作和广泛开展社会主义竞赛，特别是开展争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛的结果。
    布拉迪斯拉发发电厂的工人们在胜利地完成了今年的指标之后，到年底，还将生产四千万度电。
    在基本建设方面，在波希米亚褐煤矿区建设新矿的工人们已经大约提前四十天完成了计划。俄斯特拉发煤矿区的工人在建立新矿和改建现有矿井方面，也完成了全年的任务。
    房屋建筑工人今年为提前完成计划作出了特别巨大的努力。比尔森建筑公司和俄斯特拉发的建筑工人，已提前两个月完成了全年建筑计划。斯洛伐克的一个新的生产建筑材料的工厂，已在11月初投入生产，比原计划提前了整整一年。
    在农业方面，也频频传来提前完成计划的喜讯。今年全国所有地区都提前两个月完成了家禽收购任务，这是战后最高的纪录。改良土壤的工作也取得了很大的进展，斯洛伐克地区已经超额10％以上完成了全年任务。
    罗马尼亚
    据新华社布加勒斯特8日电在轰轰烈烈的社会主义劳动竞赛中，罗马尼亚的许多工厂企业最近纷纷提前完成今年生产指标，创造优良节约成绩，提前跨进了1960年。
    洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的第二煤铁车间已于2日完成了全年生产计划，并使高炉利用系数比原计划提高了8.55％。职工们通过降低生产成本节约了一千四百六十五万列伊（罗币）。累希擦冶炼联合企业的炼铁工人提前三十五天完成了全年生产任务。今年，他们由于改进了装料和冶炼的工作，使高炉利用系数比原计划提高了10.68％。罗曼钢管厂也提前一月完成了全年计划，节约原材料和降低生产成本的价值达一千九百六十五万列伊，并超额生产了一万五千九百吨钢管。
    全国最大的纪乌河谷煤矿在提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本以后，今年头十个月已节约了一千五百八十多万列伊，并在11月份超计划生产了一万九千七百多吨煤。
    目前，提前完成全年生产计划和节约计划的捷报还不断传来，职工们将以更大的生产成绩送别1959年。
    保加利亚
    据新华社索非亚9日电　保加利亚工业战线上的广大职工目前正在为提前超额完成今年的生产计划而奋战。最近以来，从全国各地的工业生产战线上不断传来职工们提前跨入了1960年的喜讯。
    到11月26日，全国已经有一千一百三十四个青年生产队提前跨入了1960年。到年底，他们将超计划为国家多生产价值三亿八千八百多万列弗（保币）的产品。普罗夫迪夫州列夫斯基格勒市的工业企业提前两个月完成了今年生产计划的全部指标。到年底，他们将超计划生产相当于一百三十五万列弗的产品。
    在采矿和冶金工业部门中，布加斯州“罗山”铜矿井提前三十九天完成了今年的生产计划。季米特洛夫市的列宁冶金工厂的“米尔”分厂，提前四十五天完成了今年生产计划。这个厂的职工们找窍门，挖潜力，在不增加新设备的条件下，大大提高了生产。仅仅在今年头十个半月内轧出的钢材就达三万三千吨，比1948年全年产量还多十倍。
    在电力工业部门中，全国最大的火力发电站——“斯大林”发电站的职工已在12月1日开始生产明年的产品。
    基本建设战线的工人们也不落后。斯塔拉萨哥拉州卡扎勒克市建筑部门的职工们提前四十天完成了今年计划，共建成了四十二项基本建设工程。
    今年保加利亚许多工矿企业大大提前完成生产计划的主要原因是由于保加利亚共产党各级组织和群众团体利用各种形式，广泛深入地进行政治思想工作，开展合理化建议运动和劳动竞赛。保加利亚全国有三千六百三十六个青年生产队参加了提前完成今年计划的竞赛。普罗夫迪夫市工业企业中98％的职工参加了超额完成劳动定额、争取生产优质产品的竞赛运动。他们提出了“在三年零四个月的时间内完成第二个五年计划”的口号。约占整个保加利亚工业总产值四分之一的索非亚市工业企业的职工们为了提前完成今年的生产计划，开展了合理化建议运动。仅仅在今年头九个月，他们就提出了约八千条合理化建议，其中有二千一百条已被采用，为国家节约了二千一百二十一万七千列弗。机器制造、冶金和电力工业部门的合理化建议运动也取得了很大成效。（附图片）
