Xinhua News Agency, Moscow. After several snowfalls, the cold winter has arrived in the vast Soviet land, and the winter sports season officially began in the Soviet Union on the 4th. Millions of Soviet people will be active in the severe cold and snow to make their bodies healthier.

Even before the sports season started, various preparations were already in place. People built ice rinks themselves, organized sled stations, and built ski jumping platforms.

Moscow has provided more venues for winter sports enthusiasts this year than before. The ski resort in Izmailovo Park, one of Moscow's largest ski centers, has been greatly expanded, and this center can accommodate 5,000 people skiing at the same time. Moscow alone has nearly 1.2 million square meters of ice rinks for skating enthusiasts to use. The famous sled factory in the Transcarpathian region has produced more than 200,000 sleds before the arrival of the winter sports season, and the workers have also used the surplus wood to manufacture small skis for children aged five to eight.

Although the winter sports season officially started now, the Soviet people have been flocking to wear skis or skates since the first snow covered the earth. It is estimated that no less than 300,000 people in Moscow will regularly engage in skiing this year. In the suburbs of Leningrad, people who like fishing have broken the ice and are guarding the ice cellars for fishing. In addition to hoping not to return empty-handed, they also want to breathe more fresh air. In Yakutia, in the northern part of Soviet Asia, the severe cold is often around minus 40 degrees Celsius. Outdoor activities are impossible. The young people of Yakutia have long built many indoor sports fields, and they are now energetically playing basketball, weightlifting, and parallel bars in the indoor sports fields.

    坚冰厚雪正宜锻炼身体
    苏联冬季运动蓬勃展开
    新华社莫斯科电　几番风雪，寒冷的冬天已经降临苏联辽阔的土地上，冬季运动季节4日在苏联正式开始了。千百万苏联人将活跃在严寒和冰雪中把身体锻炼得更健康。
    在运动季节还没有开始的时候，各种准备工作就已经就绪了。人们自己铺设了冰场、组织雪橇站、建造滑雪高台。
    莫斯科今年为冬季运动爱好者们提供了比以前更多的活动场地。莫斯科最大的滑雪中心之一——伊斯马伊罗沃公园中滑雪场已经大大扩大，这个中心可以同时容纳五千人滑雪。仅是莫斯科一地就有近一百二十万平方米的冰场供滑冰爱好者使用。外喀尔巴阡州著名的雪橇制造厂在冬季运动季节到来前已经生产了二十多万副雪橇，工人们还利用多余的木料为五岁到八岁的孩童们制造了小型滑雪板。
    虽然冬季运动季节从现在才正式开始，可是自从初雪复盖大地后，苏联人就已成群结队地穿上滑雪板或冰鞋了。人们预计莫斯科今年经常从事滑雪运动的人将不下三十万人。列宁格勒的郊区，喜欢钓鱼的人敲开了冰块，守在冰窖旁垂钓。他们除了希望不空手而归外，更多的是想多呼吸几口清新的空气。在苏联亚洲部分北部的雅库季亚，严寒经常是在摄氏零下四十度左右。户外运动是没法进行的。雅库季亚的青年人早就造好了许多室内运动场，他们现在已经在室内运动场里精力充沛地打篮球，练举重，玩双杠了。（附图片）
