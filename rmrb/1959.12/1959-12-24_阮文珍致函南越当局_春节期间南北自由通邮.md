Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd: Newspapers here today reported that the Ministry of Transport and Post and Telecommunications of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam released a letter written by Minister Nguyen Van Tran to the Minister of Public Works and Transport of South Vietnam on the 21st. The letter requested that South Vietnam's transportation departments, in accordance with the suggestion made by the General Post Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on November 10th of this year, allow people in both the North and South to freely exchange mail, gifts, New Year's cards, and telegrams from Christmas to the Spring Festival.

However, the relevant departments in South Vietnam have not responded to this reasonable proposal. The South Vietnamese authorities are still restricting the people in the South from mailing letters to the North, and they are unwilling to guarantee the security of letters sent from the North to the South.

　　阮文珍致函南越当局
    春节期间南北自由通邮
    据新华社河内23日电　此间报纸今天报道：越南民主共和国交通和邮电部21日公布了阮文珍部长写给南越公共工程和交通部长的一封信。信中要求南越交通部门根据越南民主共和国邮电总局在今年11月10日提出的建议，从圣诞节到春节期间，让北南两方人民自由通邮、交换赠品、贺年片和电报等。
    但是，南越有关部门对这一合理建议没有作出答复。南越当局仍在限制南方人民向北方邮寄信件，并且对北方寄往南方的信件不肯给予保障。
