Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 13th: The Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, an advanced collective attending the National Congress of Heroes, has completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule and in all respects.

By December 10th, the factory had completed its total output value plan for the year twenty-one days ahead of schedule; it had completed the output plans for diesel engines and diesel engine parts "oil pump tips" twenty-two and twenty-three days ahead of schedule, respectively; all products passed inspection, and the quality met the specified standards; the profit delivered to the state and the labor productivity plan were also overfulfilled; and the production cost from January to October decreased by 0.29% compared with the national target. This year, twelve new products were successfully trial-produced, including a high-efficiency, small-sized high-speed diesel engine specially for rural use, and a complete set of diesel engine generator units with a generating capacity of 50 kilowatts.

An important reason for the factory's achievements is its adherence to large-scale mass movements and technological innovation. The factory's Party committee promptly pointed out the direction of technological innovation, mobilizing the masses to tackle key problems. Since August, the number of technological innovation proposals from employees has increased month by month. The factory has implemented more than 3,800 proposals, which have increased production efficiency by 20% to 45%, and have broken through more than 100 production bottlenecks. Now, the production man-hours per diesel engine have been reduced by thirty-five compared with the beginning of the year, and materials have also been saved by thirty-eight kilograms.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: The Wuhan Oil Factory has completed its annual plan ahead of schedule and in all respects, based on overfulfilling its production plan month by month this year. As of December 9th, the total output value for the year was 112.56%; the output of various products exceeded the plan, with edible oil and furfural, the two main products, reaching 107.12% and 110% respectively; labor productivity reached 114.35%; profit reached 129.07%; cost was reduced by 0.46% compared with the plan; and all products met quality standards.

In the past, the Wuhan Oil Factory's products were simple, and its production potential was not fully realized. In the past year or so, employees have carried out "all-rounder" movements and adopted both indigenous and foreign methods to gradually develop in the direction of a grease chemical factory. They hydrolyze cottonseed hulls to extract furfural; turn furfural waste residue into potash fertilizer or activated carbon; use furfural wastewater and waste steam to extract sodium acetate; and extract fatty acids, industrial oil, and asphalt from waste oil footings after refining crude oil. This has increased the utilization value of cottonseed by 135% and produced a variety of chemical raw materials and medicinal raw materials for the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: The Shanxi Xing'an Chemical Materials Factory has completed its national plan for this year ahead of schedule and in all respects. As of December 8th, the total output value was 110%, the commodity output value was 102.1%, the output was 149.6%, and in addition to completing the eight types of products planned by the state, fifty-two more types were added. The quality of the main products met national requirements, labor productivity reached 109.4%, cost was reduced by 9.2% compared with the plan, the profit delivered to the state was 132.29%, and there were no major accidents throughout the year. The factory also successfully trial-produced 207 new products.

The Xing'an Chemical Materials Factory has carried out a sustained production increase and conservation movement this year. The factory's Party committee led all employees in carrying out technological innovation, continuously overcoming difficulties such as insufficient equipment and materials. From January to November, according to the statistics of 276 major innovation proposals that have been realized, the country's output has increased by 4.89 million yuan, and more than 200 workers have been saved.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang: The Nanchang Rubber Factory has completed its national production plan for this year ahead of schedule and in all respects. According to statistics up to the end of November, compared with the national plan: the total output value exceeded by 3%; the output exceeded by 8.4%; labor productivity exceeded by 28.8%; the profit delivered to the state exceeded by 12.5%; the product qualification rate exceeded by 2.1%; the varieties produced according to the state plan were completed according to plan; and the total cost decreased by 3.21% compared with the plan. Safe production was achieved.

The factory's Party committee has continuously conducted political and ideological education for employees this year. After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the factory's Party committee further led employees to speak out freely and debate, thoroughly criticizing the emotions of a few cadres who were afraid of difficulties and slacking off, and then mobilized the masses to carry out a technological innovation movement. Within two months, the factory implemented more than 40 relatively major innovation proposals, which improved production efficiency and overcame the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. In September, the monthly plan was overfulfilled by 36.72% in one fell swoop, and the average daily output value in October increased by more than 23% compared with September. The total output value completed in September and October was equivalent to four months of output value.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The Wuxi Zhengde Cotton and Wool Weaving Factory has comprehensively overfulfilled its production plan with 13% fewer workers than last year. By the end of November, the total output value was 116.5% of the annual plan, and in terms of output, knitted underwear was 127.9%, socks were 121%, the qualified product rate was 101.13% of the plan, labor productivity was 124.9% of the plan, the cost was reduced by 9.88% compared with the plan, and the profit was also completed according to the plan. The variety of colors and designs has increased from more than 50 to 105. Now, one person can top the labor efficiency of one and a half people last year.

The labor competition in this factory is in full swing. In the competition, the Party branch particularly strengthened the political and ideological education of employees, and put forward the requirements of "learning advanced points without leakage, and helping backward points without reservation." The factory signed 63 pairs of mentor-apprentice contracts and sister contracts, and widely carried out mutual teaching and learning activities. Since late October, the factory has also organized six technical performance competitions in 17 types of work, advocating "who is good, learn from whom, who is poor, help whom." More than 190 people participated in the performance, and advanced experience was widely disseminated.

After the employees were generally mobilized, the factory leaders paid attention to guiding the employees' enthusiasm to technological innovation in a timely manner. A total of 126 major innovation projects have been realized this year. The workers gradually transformed 70 hand-cranked sock knitting machines into semi-automatic sock knitting machines, and also manufactured new equipment such as B-shaped hanging thread rubber mouth sock knitting combined machines, automatic rib cars, universal flower boards, and universal flower rollers, which greatly improved production capacity.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: Due to technological innovation and increased production efficiency, the average output value created by each worker in the Guiyang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in November increased five times compared with January. Now, this factory has comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan for this year.

As of December 7th, the completion of various national plan indicators was as follows: the total output value exceeded by 38%, the output exceeded by 11.71%, the product plan for seven varieties and seventy-four specifications was fully completed, the product qualification rate exceeded the plan by 0.25%, the cost was reduced by 2.38% compared with the plan, labor productivity exceeded by 38%, and the profit delivered to the state exceeded by 16.7%. There have been no major or minor accidents since January.

The Guiyang Dyeing and Weaving Factory was developed from a small factory with more than 200 people during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and the equipment is relatively backward. This year, in order to improve production capacity, the factory's Party branch led employees to carry out a production increase and conservation movement centered on "five comparisons" (high output, high quality, shift time, cost, and labor productivity), while carrying out technological innovation to replace manual operation with machines. From January to November, a total of 245 innovations were realized, which increased work efficiency by one to ten times, and 50 simple machines with iron and wood structures were self-made and created.

    抓紧岁末每一天  全面告捷迎新年
    一批工厂提前全面完成年计划上海柴油机厂
    据新华社上海13日电　出席全国群英会的先进集体上海柴油机厂，已提前全面完成今年国家计划。
    到12月10日，这个厂提前二十一天完成了今年总产值计划；分别提前二十二天和二十三天完成柴油机、柴油机配件“油泵油尖”的产量计划；各种产品台台经过检验，质量都达到规定标准；上缴利润和劳动生产率计划也都超额完成；1月到10月的生产成本，比国家规定指标下降0.29％。今年还试制成功十二种新产品，其中有专门供农村使用的一种效率高、体积小的高速柴油机，和发电能力为五十瓩的成套柴油机发电机组。
    这个厂取得上述成就的重要原因，是坚持大搞群众运动，开展技术革新。工厂党委及时指出技术革新的方向，发动群众抢课题、攻关键。从8月份以来，职工们技术革新的建议一月比一月多，全厂共实现了三千八百多条，使生产效率分别提高20％到45％不等，并且突破了一百多项生产关键。现在，每台柴油机的生产工时比年初缩短了三十五个，材料也节省三十八公斤。武汉油厂
    据新华社武汉电　武汉油厂今年在月月超额完成生产计划的基础上，全年计划已提前全面完成。到12月9日为止，全年总产值完成112.56％；各种产品产量都超额完成计划，其中食用油和?醛两种主要产品分别完成107.12％和110％；劳动生产率完成114.35％；利润完成129.07％；成本比计划降低0.46％；全部产品产质合格。
    武汉油厂过去产品单一，生产潜力没有充分发挥。一年多来，职工们开展多面手运动，采取土洋并举的办法，逐步向油脂化学工厂的方向发展。他们把棉籽壳经过水解，提炼?醛；把?醛废渣制成钾肥或活性炭；利用?醛废水、废汽提炼醋酸钠，从毛油精炼后的废油脚里提炼酯肪酸，以及工业用油和沥青等。这样就使棉籽的利用价值提高135％，为国家生产出多种化工原料和医药原料。山西兴安化学材料厂
    据新华社太原电　山西省国营兴安化学材料厂提前全面完成了今年国家计划。到12月8日止，总产值完成110％，商品产值完成102.1％，产量完成149.6％，品种除了完成国家计划的八种以外，还增加了五十二种，主要产品质量都达到国家要求，劳动生产率完成109.4％，成本比计划降低9.2％，上缴利润完成132.29％，全年没有发生重大事故。全厂还试制成功新产品二百零七种。
    兴安化学材料厂今年持久地开展了增产节约运动。工厂党委领导全厂职工大搞技术革新，连续克服了设备、材料不足等困难。从1月到11月，据已经实现的二百七十六项较大的革新建议统计，为国家增产了四百八十九万元，节约劳力二百多人。南昌橡胶厂
    据新华社南昌电　南昌橡胶厂已提前全面完成今年国家生产计划。据到11月底的统计，与国家计划比较：总产值超额3％；产量超额8.4％；劳动生产率超额28.8％；上缴利润超额12.5％；产品合格率超额2.1％；国家规定生产的品种都按计划完成；总成本比计划下降3.21％。做到了安全生产。
    工厂党委今年不断对职工进行政治思想教育，党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布以后，工厂党委又进一步领导职工鸣放辩论，彻底批判了少数干部的畏难松劲情绪，接着发动群众开展技术革新运动。两个月内，全厂实现了四十多项比较重大的革新建议，提高了生产效率，也克服了原料不足的困难。9月份一举超额36.72％完成了月计划，10月份的平均日产值又比9月提高23％以上，9、10两个月共完成了四个月的产值计划。无锡正德棉毛织造厂
    据新华社南京电　无锡市正德棉毛织造厂在劳动力比去年减少13％的情况下，全面超额完成了生产计划。到11月底，总产值完成年计划的116.5％，产量方面针织内衣完成127.9％、袜子完成121％，正品率完成计划的101.13％，劳动生产率完成计划的124.9％，成本比计划降低9.88％，利润也完成了计划。花色品种从五十多种增加到一百零五种，现在一个人能顶得上去年一个半人的劳动效率。
    这个厂的劳动竞赛搞得热气腾腾。竞赛中，党支部特别加强了对职工的政治思想教育，提出了“学先进点滴不漏，帮后进毫无保留”的要求。全厂签订了师徒合同、姐妹合同六十三对，广泛开展了互教互学的活动。10月下旬以来，这个厂还在十七个工种中先后组织了六次技术表演赛，提倡“谁好向谁学，谁差帮助谁”，有一百九十多人参加表演，广泛传播了先进经验。
    在职工普遍发动起来以后，工厂领导上就注意及时把职工们的干劲引导到技术革新上来。今年共实现重大革新项目一百二十六项。工人们将七十台手摇织袜机逐步改装为半自动化的织袜机，还制成了B字吊线橡口织袜联合机、自动化罗纹车、万能花板、万能花滚筒等新设备，大大提高了生产能力。贵阳染织厂
    据新华社贵阳电　贵阳染织厂由于开展技术革新，提高生产效率，11月份平均每个工人创造的产值比1月份增长五倍。现在，这个厂已全面超额完成今年国家计划。
    到12月7日，各项国家计划指标完成的情况是：总产值超额38％，产量超额11.71％，七个品种七十四种规格的产品计划全部完成，产品合格率超过计划0.25％，成本比计划降低2.38％，劳动生产率超额38％，上缴利润超额16.7％。从1月份以来从未发生过大小事故。
    贵阳染织厂是1958年大跃进中由一个二百多人的小厂发展起来的，设备比较落后。今年，工厂党支部为了提高生产能力，领导职工们一面开展以“五比”（高产、优质、台时、成本、劳动生产率）为中心的增产节约运动，一面革新技术，以机器代替手工操作。从1月至11月共实现了二百四十五项革新，使工效分别提高一倍至十倍，还自制和创造了五十台铁木结构的简易机器。
