Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: A mass technological innovation and technical revolution movement aimed at improving transportation efficiency, reducing labor intensity, and saving labor used in short-distance transportation is vigorously unfolding in transportation departments across the country.

The primary content of this movement is to eliminate the heavy physical labor of carrying by shoulders in short-distance transportation. Various vehicles, ships, tracks, and ropeways are being used locally to equip the transportation teams. To achieve this goal, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are currently vigorously manufacturing vehicles and ships, building roads and opening rivers, and intensifying transportation construction. Within the past two months, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has newly built more than 200,000 various human-powered and animal-powered vehicles, and has also renovated the axles and wheels of existing vehicles to implement animal-powered traction and trailer transportation. After more than 800 small factories and mines in Sichuan Province switched to transportation by various vehicles, ships, tracks, and chutes, transportation efficiency increased five to twenty times.

With the vigorous development of the mass movement for short-distance transportation in various regions, the volume of freight at ports, freight yards, and stations is constantly and rapidly increasing. Loading and unloading work has become a weak link in transportation work. Therefore, another content of the technological innovation and technical revolution movement vigorously carried out by transportation departments in various regions is to realize indigenous mechanization and mechanization of loading and unloading work, and to rapidly improve loading and unloading work. In the past six months, the Luzhou Port in Sichuan Province mobilized workers and masses to build more than 80 indigenous cableways, flatcar tracks, simple ropeway chutes in the port area, and created 19 sets of indigenous hoisting equipment and 900 various loading and unloading vehicles, realizing indigenous mechanization of loading and unloading work at port terminals, increasing transportation efficiency four to ten times, and accelerating the turnaround of vehicles and ships. In terms of loading and unloading in motor vehicle transportation, many regions have used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to set up many loading and unloading platforms, funnels, chutes, conveyors, and indigenous hoisting equipment.

The third important content of the vigorous technological innovation and technical revolution movement in various regions is to begin changing the transportation power from human power to motorized power. The main forms are the motorization of wooden sailboats and the construction of indigenous railways and small foreign railways. This year, the state has allocated to various regions, and various regions have raised their own funds to equip wooden sailboats with small power engines, totaling more than 100,000 horsepower, and various regions are stepping up matching and installation on ships. After realizing motorized towing, ship transport efficiency can be increased by two times, and labor can be saved by 30% to 50%.

The Ministry of Transportation believes that vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technical revolution is the main way for the transportation front to ensure that it can undertake greater transportation tasks with less labor next year, and it is also an effective measure to rapidly improve transportation efficiency.

　　交通部门技术革新声势大
    造车船修索道消灭肩挑人背　装卸车用机械效率成倍提高　木帆船机械化人力大大节省
    据新华社22日讯　以提高运输效率、减轻劳动强度和节约短途运输中所使用的劳动力为目的的群众性技术革新和技术革命运动，正在全国各地交通运输部门蓬勃展开。
    这一运动的首要内容是消灭短途运输中肩挑人背的繁重体力劳动，由各地因地制宜地用各种车辆、船舶、轨道、索道等，把运输队伍武装起来。为了实现这个目的，各省、市、自治区目前正在大力制造车船、筑路开河，加紧交通建设。广西僮族自治区在最近两个月内就新造各种人力、畜力车二十多万辆，并且改造原有车辆的车轴、车轮，以便实行畜力牵引和拖挂运输。四川省八百多个小型厂矿，改由各种车、船、轨道、溜槽运输后，运输效率提高了五倍到二十倍。
    随着各地短途运输群众运动的蓬勃展开，港口、货场、车站的货运量不断地迅速增加，装卸搬运工作成了交通运输工作中的薄弱环节。因此，各地交通运输部门大搞技术革新和技术革命运动的另一个内容，是实现装卸工作的土机械化和机械化，迅速改善装卸工作。四川省泸州港发动职工群众，半年来在港区修建了八十多条土缆车道、平车轨道、简易索道溜槽，创制了十九台土起重设备和九百多辆各种装卸车辆，实现了港口码头装卸搬运工作的土机械化，运输效率提高了四倍到十倍，而且加快了车船周转。在汽车运输的装卸方面，许多地区用土洋结合的办法，已经设置了许多装卸台、漏斗、溜槽、输送机、土起重机等设备。
    各地大搞技术革新和技术革命运动的第三个重要内容是，开始把运输动力从人力改为机动。主要的形式是实行木帆船的机动化和修筑土铁路、小洋铁路。今年已经由国家分配给各地，以及各地自筹的装备木帆船的小型动力机，共计十几万马力，各地正在加紧配套和安装上船。实现机动拖带后，可以增加船运效率二倍，节省劳动力30％到50％。
    交通部认为，大力进行技术革新和技术革命，是交通运输战线上保证明年能以较少的劳动力担负更大运输任务的主要途径，也是迅速提高运输效率的有效措施。
