Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 9th: Lebanese newspapers today strongly condemned the United States' position in the United Nations voting in support of France and against the proposals of Asian and African countries on the Algerian issue. The newspapers believe that this position of the United States is inconsistent with what Eisenhower said about his visit to eleven countries.

　　"Anwar" newspaper said that Eisenhower's visit and his statements and guarantees are of no avail in restoring the reputation of the United States, because it supports French imperialism.

　　The newspaper also said, "It would be better for the US president to spare himself the labor of making long journeys to peddle 'peace and lofty ideals', because the consequences of his government's policies will be to damage peace and ideals every day, and Algeria is not the first victim of this policy, nor will it be the last."

　　This newspaper said that the hostile position of the United States towards the aspirations of the Arabs is nothing new to the Arabs, although they appear in new forms every day.

　　"Al-Hurriya" newspaper, referring to the United States' opposition to the Algerian issue proposal put forward by the Asian-African group in the United Nations, said that this position of the United States "expresses its aggressiveness and imperialist nature and its hatred of the Arab people's firm opposition to imperialism."

　　This newspaper demanded that the Arabs not be deceived by the claim that the United States has changed its policy towards the Arabs. This newspaper pointed out, "The United States will never change its policy, nor can it change its policy, because this policy is established according to the interests of large monopoly capital and the interests of the imperialist system."

　　This newspaper reiterated that the main struggle of the Arabs is still to be directed against imperialism, against the head of world imperialism, the United States. The newspaper talked about the position taken by socialist countries on major events in the Middle East in the past few years. It said that the true friends of the Arabs are the Soviet Union and all socialist countries.

　　"Sawt al-Arab" said, "Eisenhower's attempt today to maintain his country's policy and to gather the people of the East around the American camp will be opposed as they have always been opposed in the past by the tide of freedom, and deceptive propaganda can no longer influence the tide of freedom."

　　"Beirut Evening News" said, "As always, the United States and Britain oppose any resolution or step that is beneficial to the Arabs, especially in the United Nations." This newspaper acknowledged that the Soviet Union and the socialist camp have always stood by the Arabs, and the newspaper also said, "This cannot but have an impact on the hearts of Arabs, Africans, and Asians, regardless of our views on communism."

    黎巴嫩报纸抨击美国在联大支持法国殖民者
    揭露美国坚持帝国主义政策
    新华社贝鲁特9日电　黎巴嫩报纸今天强烈谴责美国在联合国投票支持法国和反对亚非国家关于阿尔及利亚问题的建议这种立场。报纸认为，美国的这种立场是同艾森豪威尔就他到十一个国家访问所说的话不相符的。
    “安瓦尔报”说，艾森豪威尔的访问和他的声明和保证对于挽回美国的声誉是无济于事的，因为它支持法帝国主义。
    报纸还说，“如果免去进行长途跋涉来兜售
  ‘和平和高尚理想’的劳苦，这对美国总统将更有好处，因为他的政府的政策的结果将形成每天对和平和理想进行损害，阿尔及利亚不是这种政策的第一个受害者，并且也不会是最后一个受害者。”
    这家报纸说，美国对阿拉伯人的愿望的敌对立场，对阿拉伯人来说并不是什么新东西，虽然它们每天以新的形式出现。
    “呼声报”在谈到美国反对联合国亚非集团所提出的阿尔及利亚问题的建议时说，美国的这种立场“表示了它的侵略性和帝国主义性质以及它对阿拉伯人坚决反对帝国主义这种立场的仇恨。”
    这家报纸要求阿拉伯人不要受所谓美国已经改变了它对阿拉伯的政策这种说法的欺骗。这家报纸指出，“美国决不会改变它的政策，它也不可能改变政策，因为这种政策是根据大垄断资本的利益和帝国主义体系的利益确立的。”
    这家报纸重申，阿拉伯人的主要斗争仍然是要针对帝国主义，针对世界帝国主义的头子美国。报纸谈到过去几年中社会主义国家对中东重大事件所采取的立场。它说，阿拉伯人的真正朋友是苏联和一切社会主义国家。
    “阿拉伯之声报”说，“艾森豪威尔今天力图维护他的国家的政策和把东方人民集合在美国阵营的周围，这种企图将像它们过去始终遭到自由的潮流的反对一样遭到反对，欺骗宣传再也不能影响自由的潮流了”。
    “贝鲁特晚报”说，“和往常一样，美国和英国反对有利于阿拉伯人的任何决议或步骤，特别是在联合国里。”这家报纸承认苏联和社会主义阵营始终站在阿拉伯人一边，报纸还说，“这不能不在阿拉伯人、非洲人和亚洲人的心灵中产生影响，不论我们对共产主义的看法如何。”
