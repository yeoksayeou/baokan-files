Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 10th: Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant has comprehensively completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule on the 9th. The completion of various indicators of the annual plan is as follows: total output value 111.7%, steel production 111.5%, steel product output 110.5%, profit 142%, labor productivity increased by 11.31% compared to the plan, and costs were lower than the state plan.

This year, Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant has adhered to putting politics in command, vigorously launching mass movements, and carrying out technological innovations. As of the end of November, the entire plant has implemented more than 15,000 technological innovation proposals, creating more than 1,540 new production records. In steel rolling production, the realization of multi-head rapid rolling, steel rolling coiling, and continuous wire drawing has led to leaps forward in both steel product output and quality.

In order to strive for comprehensive over-fulfillment of the state plan, since September, the secretary of the plant's Party committee and the plant director have formed a "three-alongside" leadership cadre group to go deep into the workshops to participate in production, inspect production, and direct production, discovering key problems in production and working with veteran workers and technicians to find solutions. This has increased the qualified rate of steel ingots by 30% and shortened the smelting time per furnace of steel by half an hour.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 10th: The Party committee of Shenyang Rubber Tire Factory led employees to continuously overcome right-leaning sentiments among cadres, continuously carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and successfully completed the annual state plan.

As of December 6th, the factory's actual production compared with the annual state plan: total output value exceeded by 12%; output of outer tires for automobiles, motorcycles, and tractors exceeded by 35.61%, output of inner tubes exceeded by 18.12%; output of outer tires for bicycles and handcarts exceeded by 3.52%, output of inner tubes exceeded by 3.21%; labor productivity exceeded by 16.92%; profits delivered to the state exceeded by 16.12%; total cost of all products was reduced by 2.29% compared with the state plan; the quality of products all met or exceeded the national requirements.

This year, the factory's Party committee adhered to the working method of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements, and continuously organized employees to carry out socialist labor competitions and technological innovations. In November, the factory, just by launching technical performance competitions, enabled more than 88% of production workers to break through production quotas, playing an important role in ensuring the early completion of the annual plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 10th: Jinan Power Plant fully tapped the potential of equipment and completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule. As of December 5th, the plant's total output value was 100.22% of the plan, power generation was 100.02% of the plan, coal consumption was 4.11% lower than the plan, plant electricity consumption was 1.95% lower than the plan, and costs were 3.68% lower than the plan. Excellent work was also done in terms of safe production, with generator units consistently maintaining safe operation.

In order to ensure the early completion of the annual plan, the employees of Jinan Power Plant, focusing on key issues affecting output improvement, vigorously launched technological innovations and technological revolutions, improving equipment output by improving operation and equipment structure and performance. At the same time, the entire plant summarized and promoted the boiler operation methods of "three goods" (good unity, good ignition, good cleanliness), "three stabilities" (stable water level, stable steam pressure, stable flow), and "four responsibilities" (normal combustion during shift handover, ash mixing in proportion during shift handover, preparation for load increase and decrease, no development of boiler coking), which greatly improved the combustion condition of the boiler. In addition, they also improved the generator cooling system and installed a water spray cooling device to lower the intake air temperature of the generator, which played a significant role in improving equipment output.

    全面跃进迎新年
    又一批企业提前完成年计划
    天津第一钢厂
    据新华社天津10日电天津第一钢厂已在9日提前全面完成今年的国家计划。各项指标完成年计划的情况是：总产值111.7％，钢产量111.5％，钢材产量110.5％，利润142％，劳动生产率比计划提高11.31％，成本比国家计划低。
    今年以来，天津第一钢厂坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，开展技术革新。全厂到11月底为止，共实现了一万五千多件技术革新建议，创造了一千五百四十多次生产新纪录。在轧钢生产中实现了多头快轧、轧钢围盘化、拔丝连续化后，使钢材产量、质量双双跃进。
    为争取全面超额完成国家计划，从9月份以来，这个厂的党委书记和厂长就组成了领导干部“三边”小组，深入车间边参加生产、边检查生产、边指挥生产，发现生产中的关键问题，就和老工人、技术人员一起设法解决。使钢锭合格率提高了30％，每炉钢的溶炼时间缩短了半小时。
    沈阳橡胶轮胎厂
    据新华社沈阳电　沈阳橡胶轮胎厂党委领导职工不断克服干部中的右倾情绪，持续开展增产节约运动，出色地完成了全年国家计划。
    到12月6日止，这个厂的生产实绩与全年国家计划比较：总产值超额12％；汽车、摩托车、拖拉机轮胎的外胎产量超额35.61％，内胎产量超额18.12％；自行车、手推车轮胎的外胎产量超额3.52％，内胎产量超额3.21％；劳动生产率超额16.92％；上交利润超额16.12％；全部产品总成本比国家计划降低2.29％；产品的质量都达到或超过了国家要求。
    这个厂的党委今年坚持了集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的工作方法，不断组织职工开展社会主义劳动竞赛和技术革新。11月份，全厂仅在开展技术表演赛中，就使88％以上的生产工人突破了生产定额，对保证提前完成年计划起了重要的作用。
    济南发电厂
    据新华社济南10日电　济南发电厂充分挖掘设备潜力，提前全面完成了年度生产计划。截至12月5日，这个厂的总产值完成计划的100.22％，发电量完成计划的100.02％，煤耗比计划降低4.11％，厂用电比计划降低1.95％，成本比计划降低3.68％。在安全生产方面做得也很出色，发电机组一直保持着安全运行。
    济南发电厂职工为了保证提前完成年计划，他们针对影响出力提高的关键问题，大闹技术革新与技术革命，从改进操作和设备结构、性能等方面提高设备出力。同时，全厂总结推广了“三好”（团结好，引火好，清洁好）、“三稳”（水位稳，汽压稳，流量稳）、“四负责”（交接班燃烧正常，交接班按比例掺灰，做好升降负荷准备，锅炉结焦不发展）的锅炉操作方法，大大改善了锅炉的燃烧状况。此外，他们还改进发电机的冷却系统，加装喷水冷却装置，降低发电机的进风温度，对于提高设备出力都起了很大作用。
