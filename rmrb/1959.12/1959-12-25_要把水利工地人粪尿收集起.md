Suggestion

　　Collect Human Waste and Urine at Water Conservancy Construction Sites
    I am a migrant worker from the Luzhuang Reservoir in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province. The toilets at our construction site are all earthen pits, unable to retain human urine, which results in the loss of valuable fertilizer.

    Currently, there are thousands upon thousands of reservoir projects across the country, and similar situations may exist. Therefore, I suggest that all reservoirs in various regions must find ways to collect all human waste and urine. This will greatly benefit agricultural production increase next year.

　　要把水利工地人粪尿收集起
    我是山西闻喜县吕庄水库的民工。我们工地上的厕所都是土坑，收不住人尿，这就把珍贵的肥料流失了。
    现在全国各地有成千上万的水库工程，也可能有这样的情况。因此，我建议各地水库一定要想方设法把所有的人粪尿收集起来。这对明年农业增产是很有好处的。
