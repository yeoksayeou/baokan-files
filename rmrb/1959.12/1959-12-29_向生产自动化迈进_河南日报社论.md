　　Moving Towards Production Automation
　　Henan Daily Editorial
    A massive mass movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution has fully unfolded in the Luoyang Tractor Factory and the Luoyang Bearing Factory. This movement has developed to a new stage of comprehensively improving the level of mechanization and advancing towards automation. It has found the direction for technological innovation and technological revolution in our modern enterprises, and opened up infinitely broad avenues for further improving the technical level of modern enterprises.
    In the movement to fully carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, some people emphasize that modern enterprises are "all advanced, and there is nothing to innovate." The technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the Luoyang Tractor Factory and Luoyang Bearing Factory tells us that the production potential of modern enterprises is inexhaustible, and there is much to be done in technological innovation. This is because all production technologies and sciences are constantly developing and advancing, and the technological development of industrial production is also endless. The argument that "modern enterprises are already very advanced, and there is nothing to innovate" essentially negates the theory of continuous revolution and views things as static and unchanging. Of course, since the founding of the People's Republic, many of our newly built modern enterprises have world-class technology and equipment, but it should also be recognized that people have not limited the development of technology to a certain stage. Because if we want to build socialism at a high speed, the most important thing is to have higher labor productivity and promote the rapid improvement of the level of social production.
    Why is it said that improving the level of mechanization and then realizing production automation is the direction of technological innovation and technological revolution in modern enterprises? This is determined by the current situation and the conditions of modern enterprises. The Party requires all enterprises to develop production at the fastest speed. To develop production at a high speed, we can only go all out, engage in technological innovation and technological revolution in a big way, and conform to the requirements of the general line of socialist construction. The main task of technological innovation and technological revolution is to transform manual operations into semi-mechanical and mechanical operations, and to further develop from production mechanization to production electrification and automation, and from the automation of one machine tool to the gradual development of overall automation. Such a process of technological innovation and technological revolution is also a process of continuous production development. Modern enterprises have advanced equipment, a relatively high degree of mechanization and automation, relatively reasonable technological regulations and technological routes, and a relatively high level of worker operating skills. These are favorable conditions for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, improving the level of mechanization, and moving towards automation. As long as we can further improve the design and modify the equipment on the basis of the original equipment and original technology, and gradually develop to the overall automation of production, we can greatly improve production efficiency. The fact that the Luoyang Tractor Factory can make batches of parts and products reach and exceed the designed quota in a very short period of time is the result of modifying equipment and innovating technology. In modern enterprises, the widespread adoption of production mechanization and automation can also greatly save labor. The higher the degree of mechanization and automation, the less human labor is required. The automatic line for grinding the inner ring of bearing rings, successfully modified by the Luoyang Bearing Factory, saves more than 70% of labor; due to the improvement of the automation level of machine tools, many machine tools have been upgraded from one person operating one machine to one person looking after multiple machines. Through technological innovation and technological revolution, modern enterprises can improve the level of mechanization and automation, in addition to saving labor and improving labor productivity, but also greatly reduce the labor intensity of workers, thereby gradually narrowing the gap between mental and physical labor; can eliminate many errors that are difficult to avoid in manual operations, and further improve product quality; can ensure personal safety during operation and extend the life of mechanical equipment. Therefore, we say that improving the level of mechanization and automation is the direction of technological innovation and technological revolution in modern enterprises.
    However, at the mention of automation, people always think that this is a matter for the future. In fact, it is no longer a distant matter for modern enterprises to move towards automation. Because the improvement of the level of mechanization and the gradual realization of automation that we are talking about is not to kick away the original set of technological equipment and technological processing routes to start a new set, but to improve the level of production and overcome the weak links in the production process on the existing basis. We all know that revolution is a leap in historical development. But every leap is gradually developed from quantitative change to qualitative change. The same is true of technological revolution. From manual labor to mechanization, to electrification, and automation, it is also the result of continuous technological innovation. Therefore, to make labor productivity develop by leaps and bounds, we must implement technological innovation and technological revolution. A major technological innovation often changes the entire face of production. Many facts in the Luoyang Tractor Factory and Luoyang Bearing Factory prove this point. It is of course unrealistic to not start from the existing production level, to be divorced from production reality, and to imagine and engage in any kind of automation. To carry out technological innovation and technological revolution in modern enterprises, we must launch a mass movement in a big way. Some people think that the masses can only engage in simple innovation, and cannot engage in mechanization and automation. This idea and practice is wrong. It should be believed that the working masses in modern enterprises can not only master modern technology, but also accumulate rich knowledge and experience in production practice; their minds are often pregnant with the seeds of continuous innovation, and technical personnel and intellectuals must stand in the hot mass movement to help workers solve practical problems in technological innovation, so as to enrich their own theories and improve their ideological awareness in production practice.
    There are also some people who think of expensive parts, rare materials, etc. when it comes to mechanization and automation. In fact, the scope of mechanization and automation varies in size, and the degree varies in high and low. Many automatic devices in the Luoyang Tractor Factory are materials found in scrap piles. Some automatic devices only add some iron wires, a hemp rope, and a piece of iron sheet to improve efficiency by several times and replace the labor of several people. Of course, this does not mean that there is no need to engage in some complex, major, and cutting-edge innovation projects, but that they should be appropriately arranged and carried out in a planned and led manner; everything should be tested, and constantly innovate and improve in accordance with the principle of easy first and difficult later, and from low to high. Some equipment is now simple, and after a period of continuous innovation and improvement, it will become advanced.
    Enterprises should have a plan for the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. Factories with a high degree of mechanization such as the Luoyang Tractor Factory and Luoyang Bearing Factory still have "articles to do" in technological innovation. Other modern factories need to carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, improve the technical level, and tap production potential. At present, the modern enterprises in our province can be roughly divided into two types: one is mainly mechanical equipment; the other is mainly automated equipment. These two types of enterprises actually have great production potential. For factories that already use mechanical equipment and have basically achieved mechanization, the direction of technological innovation and technological revolution should be to make the mechanization equipment that is not yet complete complete, and to further improve the degree of mechanization that is not high; highly mechanized factories should gradually move towards production automation. The level of automated production enterprises in our province is generally not very high. Many of them belong to machine tool automation and semi-automation. A truly highly automated enterprise is one in which the production process required from raw material processing to finished product manufacturing only requires human supervision and control, and does not require direct human labor assistance. Automated and semi-automated machine tools in the Luoyang Bearing Factory only account for more than 68% of the total machine tools in the factory. Factories of this type mainly improve the degree of automation, automate the production of some machine tools, and gradually develop to overall automation, realizing one-person multi-machine operation; machine tools that have already been automated should develop to automatic assembly lines, so that labor productivity can be continuously improved. These should be determined according to different circumstances. Through technological innovation and technological revolution, many modern enterprises in our province will gradually develop from the mechanization and automation of single machine tools to the overall automation of the production process, ensuring that our industrial production reaches a higher level.

　　向生产自动化迈进
　　河南日报社论
    一个声势浩大的以技术革新与技术革命为中心的群众性增产节约运动，在洛阳拖拉机制造厂、洛阳轴承厂全面展开了。这个运动已经发展到全面提高机械化程度，向自动化进军的新阶段。它为我们现代化企业的技术革新与技术革命找到前进的方向；开辟了进一步提高现代化企业技术水平的无限广阔的道路。
    在全面开展技术革新和技术革命的运动中，有些人强调现代化企业“一切都是先进的，没有什么可革”。洛阳拖拉机制造厂、洛阳轴承厂的技术革新和技术革命运动告诉我们：现代化企业的生产潜力是挖不尽的，技术革新大有文章可做。因为一切生产技术与科学都是不断发展不断前进的，工业生产的技术发展也是无止境的。那种认为“现代化企业已经很先进了，没有什么可以革新了”的论调实质上是否定了不断革命论，把事物看成是静止的，一成不变的。当然，建国以来，我们有许多新建的现代化企业技术装备是世界上头等的，但是也应该看到，人们并没有把技术的发展限制在某一个阶段。因为我们要高速度地建设社会主义，最重要的是要有更高的劳动生产率，促进社会生产水平迅速提高。
    为什么说提高机械化程度、进而实现生产自动化，是现代化企业技术革新和技术革命的方向呢？这是当前的形势和现代化企业的条件所决定的。党要求所有的企业用最快的速度发展生产。要高速度地发展生产，只有鼓足更大干劲，大闹技术革新和技术革命，才能符合社会主义建设总路线的要求。而技术革新和技术革命的主要任务，就是要变手工操作为半机械和机械化操作，由生产机械化进一步发展到生产电气化和自动化，由一个机床的自动化逐步发展到全盘的自动化。这样一个技术革新和技术革命的过程，也是生产不断发展的过程。现代化企业的设备先进，机械化、自动化程度比较高，工艺规程、工艺路线比较合理，工人操作技术水平比较高，这是开展技术革新和技术革命，提高机械化程度和走向自动化的有利条件。只要能够在原有设备、原有工艺的基础上，进一步改进设计、改装设备，逐步发展到生产全盘自动化，就可以大大提高生产率。像洛阳拖拉机制造厂能够在很短时间内，使成批成批的零件产品达到和超过设计定额，就是由于改装设备和革新技术的结果。在现代化企业里，广泛采用生产机械化、自动化，还可以大大节省劳动力。机械化、自动化的程度愈高，人的劳动量就愈少。洛阳轴承厂改装成功的一条轴承环内圈磨加工自动线，劳动力就节省70％以上；由于提高了机床自动化的程度，很多机床从原来一人操作一台提高到一人看管多台。现代化企业通过技术革新和技术革命，提高机械化和自动化的程度，除了节省劳动力、提高劳动生产率以外，还可大大减轻工人的劳动强度，从而使脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别逐渐缩小；可以消除许多手工操作中不易避免的误差，进一步提高产品质量；可以保证操作中的人身安全，延长机械设备的寿命。所以我们说，提高机械化、自动化的程度，是现代化企业技术革新和技术革命的方向。
    但是，眼前一提起自动化，人们总认为这是将来的事。其实，现代化企业向自动化迈进已经不是遥远的事情了。因为我们所说的提高机械化程度，逐步实现自动化，并不是要踢开原来的一套工艺装备和工艺加工路线，去重新另搞一套，而是在现有的基础上，围绕提高生产水平，克服生产过程中的薄弱环节进行的。我们都知道，革命就是历史发展的一个飞跃。但是每个飞跃都是由量变到质变逐步发展的。技术革命也是如此。从手工劳动到机械化、到电气化、自动化，也是不断地进行技术革新的结果。因此，要使劳动生产率飞跃发展，必须实行技术革新和技术革命。一项重大的技术革新，往往会引起整个生产面貌的改观。洛阳拖拉机制造厂和洛阳轴承厂的许多事实都证明了这个问题。那种不从现有生产水平出发，脱离生产实际，去设想和去搞什么自动化，当然是不现实的。在现代化企业里进行技术革新和技术革命，必须大搞群众运动。有些人认为群众只能搞简单的革新，不能搞机械化、自动化。这种想法和作法是错误的。应该相信，工人群众在现代化企业里不仅可以掌握现代技术，而且在生产实践中积累了丰富的知识和经验；在他们思想上经常孕育着不断革新的萌芽，技术人员和知识分子必须站在火热的群众运动中，帮助工人解决技术革新中的实际问题，以便在生产实践中来丰富自己的理论，提高自己的思想觉悟。
    还有一些人，一提起搞机械化、自动化就想起昂贵的机件，稀有的材料，等等。其实，机械化、自动化的范围有大有小，程度有高有低。洛阳拖拉机制造厂的很多自动化装置，都是在废料堆里找到的材料，有些自动装置只是增加一些铁丝、一条麻绳、一块铁皮就提高效率好几倍，代替若干个人的劳动。当然，这并不是说不需要搞一些复杂的、重大的、尖端的革新项目，而是要适当地安排，有计划、有领导地进行；一切经过试验，本着先易后难、由低到高的原则，不断革新和不断改进。有的设备现在是简陋的，经过一个时期的不断革新和提高，就会变成为先进的。
    技术革新与技术革命运动，各企业都应该有个规划。洛阳拖拉机制造厂和洛阳轴承厂这样的机械化程度较高的工厂，技术革新还有“文章可做”，其他的一些现代化工厂更需要开展技术革新和技术革命，提高技术水平，挖掘生产潜力。当前我省的现代化企业大体可分两种类型：一种是以机械化设备为主；一种是以自动化设备为主。这两种企业实际上都存在着很大的生产潜力。已经使用机械设备、基本实现机械化的工厂，技术革新与技术革命的方向，应该是把机械化装备还不完备的使其达到完备，机械化程度不高的再进一步提高；高度机械化的则应该逐步向生产自动化迈进。我省自动化生产的企业一般的说程度并不太高，很多是属于机床自动化和半自动化。真正的高度自动化企业是从原料加工到制造成品所必需的生产过程，只需要人的监督和控制，而不需要人的直接劳动协助。洛阳轴承厂自动化和半自动化的机床，只占全厂机床的68％以上。像这一类的工厂主要是提高自动化程度，使部分机床生产自动化，逐步发展到全盘自动化，实现一人多机操作；已经自动化的机床，应向自动流水作业线发展，使劳动生产率不断提高。这些都要根据不同的情况而定。通过技术革新和技术革命，将会使我省许多现代化企业由单台机床的机械化、自动化，逐步发展到生产过程的全盘自动化，保证我们的工业生产达到更高的水平。
