Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 15th: The main project of the Weishan Water Control Project on the Yellow River in Shandong Province—the cut-off dam—was successfully closed at 5:00 PM on December 9th. From now on, the Yellow River has once again been cut off in Shandong Province, and the turbulent Yellow River water from upstream is forced to turn into the newly excavated diversion river, flowing calmly eastward under the control of the barrage gate.

The Weishan Hub Project is the key to Shandong's water conservancy construction and an important project for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's water hazards. This project consists of more than forty major projects, including the Dongping Lake Reservoir, which can store 4 billion cubic meters of water, a barrage dam, a barrage gate, a lake entrance gate, a lake exit gate, a Yellow River diversion gate, a sand prevention gate, a ship lock, a power station, and a desilting basin. The barrage dam is built on the Yellow River channel west of Huangshan Mountain in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, and the remaining forty-plus projects are built in Shouzhang and Liangshan counties. The entire hub project is huge in scale and technically complex. The earthwork alone amounts to more than 63.79 million cubic meters. If these earthworks were built into earth walls, each one meter high and wide, they could circle the Earth 1.6 times. This project is the highest-value and most beneficial hub project for comprehensive utilization of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Since construction began in May last year, the 200-li-long embankment and stone revetment of the Dongping Lake Reservoir, the Yellow River diversion gate, the barrage gate, the barrage dam, the lake exit gate, the desilting basin, and corresponding diversion rivers, canals, culverts, and gates have been completed one after another. Currently, the lake entrance gate, the sand prevention gate, and other projects are also under intense construction.

After the completion of this cut-off project, the projects that have been or are about to be built can be brought into full play. The threat of a once-in-a-century flood on the Yellow River to areas below Weishan can be reduced through barrage gates and other projects, and one-third of the province's farmland (more than 40 million mu) can be irrigated perennially. At the same time, the threat of ice jams in the lower reaches of the Yellow River can be completely eliminated. In the future, if ice jams occur, the outflow can be reduced through the control of the Weishan hub project, and the barrage gates can even be completely closed, putting the ice water into the Dongping Lake Reservoir, causing the lower reaches of the Yellow River to dry up for forty days. During the Yellow River's dry season, the water stored in the Dongping Lake Reservoir can be supplied to downstream industrial and agricultural production, navigation, power generation, and other needs at any time.

The success of cutting off the Yellow River fully demonstrates the infinite wisdom and talent of the people. In the construction of this barrage dam, which is 362 meters long and 58 meters wide, people adopted and promoted the "straw bundle advancement and cut-off method" accumulated by the working people of our country in their long-term struggle with the Yellow River. Based on the principle of local material utilization and self-reliance, they built this dam entirely with soil, stones, sorghum stalks, and willow branches, without using a single piece of steel or a single pound of cement. In order to stay ahead of the ice flood, they braved wind, frost, rain, and snow, and everyone was full of energy, vigorously engaging in technological innovation. In the construction process, more than 100 advanced experiences were created and promoted, increasing work efficiency by more than one time. Therefore, this project was completed in a very short period of time, and no accidents occurred during the construction process. The labor days for the entire project were 7.2% less than originally planned, and straw materials were saved by 42%. After acceptance inspection, the quality was very good.

From the beginning of the construction of the Weishan Hub Project, it has received enthusiastic support and assistance from the people of the entire province. The number of migrant workers from all over the country participating in this project often exceeded 100,000. Officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong Province also actively participated in the construction of this project. In the design and construction, the project also received strong support from relevant central departments, Soviet experts, and Henan and other provinces. This kind of large-scale collaboration and support fully demonstrates the great power of the Party's general line for building socialism, the power of the people's communes, and the great power of the selfless communist ideology. This is an important guarantee for the rapid progress of the Weishan Hub Project and the great victory of cutting off the Yellow River in a short period of time.

On the morning of December 12, more than 30,000 migrant worker representatives participating in the construction of this project and nearby farmers held a rally at the construction site to warmly celebrate the great victory of cutting off the Yellow River. At the meeting, Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on behalf of the Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, extended warm congratulations and cordial greetings to all the builders. He expressed sincere gratitude to relevant central departments, Soviet experts, and representatives from Henan and other provinces for their support in the construction of this project. He called on the builders participating in this project to make persistent efforts and, together with other heroes, and together with the farmers participating in water conservancy construction throughout the province, to win even greater victories.

Invited to attend the victory celebration of the Weishan Hub Project cut-off were representatives and guests from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and 19 provinces including Henan.

    山东好汉斩断黄河  位山大坝胜利合龙
    可减轻洪水威胁消灭冰凌危害，可灌溉四千万亩农田
    新华社济南15日电　山东省黄河位山水利枢纽的主体工程——截流拦河大坝，已经在12月9日下午五时胜利合龙。从此，黄河在山东境内又被拦腰斩断了，从上游来的滚滚黄水被迫调头奔向新挖的引河，通过拦河闸的控制平静地东流。
    位山枢纽工程是山东水利建设的重点，也是根治黄河水害的重要工程之一。这个工程是由可以蓄水四十亿立方米的东平湖大水库、拦河坝、拦河闸、进湖闸、出湖闸、引黄闸、防沙闸、船闸、电站、沉沙池等四十余项主要工程构成的。拦河大坝建设在山东寿张县黄山以西的黄河河道上，其余的四十多项工程都建设在寿张和梁山县境内。整个枢纽工程规模巨大，技术也很复杂。单是土方工程就有六千三百七十九万多立方米。如果把这些土方筑成高、宽各一立方米的土墙，可以环绕地球一点六周。这一工程是黄河下游综合利用价值最高，效益最大的一级枢纽工程。自从去年5月开工以来到现在已先后完成了东平湖水库二百余里的围堤、石护坡和引黄闸、拦河闸、拦河坝、出湖闸、沉沙池以及相应的引河、渠道、涵闸等工程，现在进湖闸、防沙闸等也正在紧张施工。
    这个截流工程竣工后，可以使已经或即将建成的工程充分发挥作用。可以通过拦河闸等工程减轻黄河百年一遇的洪水对位山以下地区的威胁，使全省三分之一的农田（四千多万亩）得到常年灌溉。同时，还可以彻底消灭黄河下游的凌汛威胁，今后如果遇到凌汛，可以通过位山枢纽工程的控制，减少下泄流量，甚至可以把拦河闸门完全关闭，把冰水放入东平湖水库，使黄河下游断流四十天；到黄河枯水季节，东平湖水库的蓄水又可以随时供应下游工农业生产和航运、发电等需要。
    腰斩黄河的成功，充分显示了人民群众的无穷智慧和才能。在建设这个长三百六十二米宽五十八米的拦河大坝工程中，人们采取和发扬了我国劳动人民同黄河长期搏斗中积累起来的“秸埽进占截流法”。他们根据就地取材，自力更生的原则，没有用一根钢筋、一斤水泥，完全用泥土、石块、高粱秸、柳枝建成了这个大坝。为了跑在凌汛前头，他们不避风霜雨雪，人人鼓足干劲，个个大闹技术革新，在施工中前后共创造和推广了一百多项先进经验，使工效提高一倍多。因此，这个工程在很短的时间内就全部建成了，在施工中没有发生任何事故。整个工程的劳动工日比原计划节省7.2％，秸料节省42％。经过验收检查，质量很好。
    建设位山枢纽工程一开始就得到全省人民的热烈支援和帮助。来自各地参加这项工程建设的民工经常在十万人以上。中国人民解放军驻山东部队的官兵也积极参加了这个工程的建设。工程在设计和施工中，还得到了中央有关部门和苏联专家，以及河南等省的大力支援。这种大协作、大支援，充分显示了党的建设社会主义总路线的巨大威力，人民公社的威力，大公无私的共产主义思想的巨大威力。这是位山上枢纽工程建设进展迅速，在短时间内取得腰斩黄河伟大胜利的重要保证。
    12月12日上午，参加建设这个工程的民工代表和附近的农民三万多人在工地上举行集会，热烈地庆祝腰斩黄河的伟大胜利。会上，中共山东省委第一书记舒同代表省委、省人民委员会向全体建设者表示热烈的祝贺和亲切的慰问。向支援建设这个工程的中央有关部门、苏联专家和河南等省的代表表示深切的感谢。他号召参加这项工程的建设者再接再厉，和其他各路英雄一起，和全省参加水利建设的农民一起夺取更大的胜利。
    应邀参加位山枢纽工程截流胜利庆祝大会的，还有水利电力部、农业部、黄河水利委员会和河南等十九个省的代表和来宾。
