Nanjing, A World Transformed
Xia Yang

	High on the mountaintop, a series of hemispherical roofs gleam with a silver-white light, attracting much attention. This is the famous Purple Mountain Observatory. People ascend this peak by way of clean, dust-free, flower-lined wide roads or tunnel-like tree-lined avenues. Standing before the observatory, one can look out over the undulating mountains and the rushing river; surrounded by rivers and mountains, a sea of green trees; within the sea of trees, a magnificent city; brand-new houses densely packed, towering chimneys standing tall: this is Nanjing, advancing in step with many cities of the motherland, a greened, beautified, industrialized, and newly born city of Nanjing.

	Nanjing, a city with a history of more than two thousand four hundred years, has had many names: Jinling, Moling, Stone, Jianye, Jianye, Jiankang, Baixia, Shengzhou, Yingtian, Tianjing.... Here are high mountains—Purple Mountain, deep water—Yangtze River, plains—Jianghuai Plain. Here is the "江南 (Jiangnan - South of the Yangtze River) spring scenery of "thousands of miles of orioles singing and green reflected in red". No wonder eight emperors established their capitals here, for a total of three hundred and sixty-six years. Zhuge Liang said: "The terrain of Moling, the dragon coils around Zhongshan, the tiger crouches in Stone City, truly a capital for emperors." Xie Tiao said: "Jiangnan is a beautiful place, Jinling is the state of emperors." Since Sun Wu of the Three Kingdoms, the Eastern Jin, Song, Qi, Liang, Chen, Southern Tang, and Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming Dynasty established their capitals here. After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the Chinese democratic revolution in 1927, he established a counter-revolutionary dynasty here, making Nanjing the center of reactionary rule. During the Japanese imperialist invasion of China, the puppet court of the traitor Wang Jingwei was also set up here. Nanjing, this ancient city, how much bitter history it has!

	The beautiful land of Jiangnan suffered such misfortune, and the great rivers and mountains were occupied by reactionary rulers as the hub of oppression of the people. The exploiting classes enjoyed themselves here, vying for the scenic spots, giving the people endless suffering of war and the city relentless and endless destruction. Countless poets in the feudal era repeatedly chanted here, nothing more than the emotion of changing dynasties, the sorrow of the country's destruction and the city's demise. Li Taibai said: "The Phoenix Terrace is empty, the river flows by itself," "The misty waves on the river make people sad." Wen Tianxiang said: "From today, I bid farewell to Jiangnan, and I will return as a cuckoo crying blood." Sa Dula said: "The leaves fall, the pine path is cold, and the ghost fire flickers high and low." Wu Meicun said: "Pity a piece of moon over the Qinhuai River, once illuminated the surrender flag out of Stone City." We can list countless such poems. The poets are all kinds of people, and it is even more unnecessary to talk about the Emperor Li Yu of the fallen state saying "The old country is unbearable to look back on in the bright moon."

	However, for the masses of the people, they persisted in the revolutionary struggle, advancing wave upon wave. It was the people who truly made "the royal aura of Jinling fade away", and finally made this historical city return to their hands. The people became the masters of Stone City, and will always be the masters here. On April 24, 1949, the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party of China, with the support of the people, crossed the Yangtze River, making Nanjing a world transformed from then on.

	The history of Nanjing should be written by the people. This is a glorious city, a city with a tradition of revolutionary struggle. Is it not? Yue Fei, Liang Hongyu, and Shi Kefa once resisted foreign invaders here. These distant events need not be said much. In the past hundred years, the largest and longest-lasting peasant movement in Chinese history—the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom—wasn't it established here in Tianjing for as long as eleven years? During the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen took office as the provisional president here and also established a provisional capital here. More importantly, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, a long-term, arduous revolutionary struggle with lofty ideals was carried out here. Yuhuatai, this is the historical witness.

	The Kuomintang reactionaries massacred thousands upon thousands of revolutionary martyrs in Yuhuatai. The Yuhua stones, a specialty of Yuhuatai, are stained with the blood of the martyrs. The martyrs wrote countless admirable stories and moving poems with their own blood.

	They shed their heads and spilled their blood, at the cost of their lives. Whenever I stand on Yuhuatai, I always hear the martyrs singing their songs with their spirit of regarding death as home, their passionate voices, and their optimistic and confident feelings:

	Life and death are ordinary,
	We have lofty ideals.
	Willing to cultivate with life,
	Happy flowers, fragrant for centuries.
	Flowers bloom all over Yuhuatai,
	--There will always be that day!

	Brave charge,
	We will have the final success.
	Willing to wash with hot blood,
	The revolutionary flag, eternally bright red.
	The red flag is planted on Nanjing,
	--There will always be that day!

	Break through the prison,
	We want complete liberation.
	Sing with all our loyalty,
	Songs of victory, loud and clear forever.
	Songs of triumph spread all over China,
	--There will always be that day!

	Here it is, this day has come. Nanjing, a world transformed.

	Nanjing, no longer playing mournful horns. Marches forward, leaping songs, resound in every corner. Many factories have been newly built on barren platforms, and the era of "fallen leaves and no one on the cold pine path" will never return. The era of the exploiting class's debauchery and slaughter of the people will never return.

	When we liberated Nanjing, we took over 1,191 units from the Kuomintang government, of which 80% were bureaucratic organs, and only 38 could be considered productive units. The city had 300,000 unemployed prostitutes and unemployed people. According to the Kuomintang's statistics in 1948, out of more than one million people in the city, there were 90,000 "waiters," "maids," and "followers," and only 20,000 industrial workers. A chemical factory took more than three years to build and never opened for a single day. An agricultural machinery company produced two rice milling machines in eight months. A large number of American goods flooded in like a tide. Wasn't this only a distorted "prosperity"!

	In the past ten years, Nanjing has become a people's industrial city. Construction, construction, construction, continuous construction. From nothing to something, from small to large, from few to many, from low to high, completely transforming the mess left by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Here appeared steel factories, chemical factories, machinery factories, automobile factories, instrument factories... The number of factories with more than 100 people has increased eleven times, and the number of factories with more than 500 people has grown from five to more than 100. In Beijing, the heart of the motherland, and Shanghai, the industrial base, in remote Xinjiang and the frontier Hainan, on the water conservancy construction sites of the Yellow River and the newly built northwest oil fields... and in many places abroad, one can see the word "Nanjing" printed on industrial products. There were originally only 74 kinds of products, but now there are more than 4,000: from trucks, tractors, generators, gantry planers, to film projectors, radios, and medical drugs.

	As production developed, the economy prospered, and culture also followed. Twenty-seven new-type institutions of higher learning have replaced the "Central University" and "Central Political University," which used to train young masters and lords, and the "Jinling University" and "Jinling Women's University," which attempted to train American slaves. Today, a "Nanjing University" with more than 6,000 students exceeds the total number of university students in the entire "capital" during the Kuomintang rule by a factor of one.

	The population has increased, and the transportation industry has developed. The large city with a circumference of 33.4 kilometers, which was once a desolate area within the city, is now filled with houses, and new developments have taken place in the suburbs. The railway in the city has been dismantled and moved outside the city. The bridge across the Yangtze River has also begun construction.

	Workers, peasants, staff, students... everyone works actively and lives happily. The scenic spots and historical sites left over from past dynasties have become places to enrich spiritual life and rest. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake, Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Jiming Temple and Linggu Temple, Qingliang Mountain and Qixia Mountain, Bailuzhou and Yanziji, Rouge Well and Qinhuai River, Confucius Temple and Heavenly King's Palace... Every place here has poems, legends, and stories for people to chant and talk about, and the people enjoy a happy life to their heart's content. The scenic areas that have been repaired and renovated are even more beautiful and splendid.

	Nanjing has a history of 2,431 years since its founding, and ten years of liberation is not even a fraction of this history. However, the changes in these ten years have exceeded the past thousands of years. We simply cannot calculate what kind of leap forward speed this is; in thousands of words, we cannot describe even a ten-thousandth of the changes in Nanjing.

	I rushed to Yuhuatai to deliver the good news and flowers to the Martyrs' Monument. I looked at the huge characters inscribed by Chairman Mao: "Long Live the Martyrs!" I said: "Martyrs, your ideals have been realized!"

	Crowds of people like tides often flow to Yuhuatai, where they draw revolutionary strength, and for Nanjing to be even more beautiful, for the motherland to move towards communism, and also for world peace and the liberation of mankind, they struggle and bravely advance!

	Although I am not a poet, I cannot help but feel the excitement in my heart and sing the "Ode to Yuhuatai":

	The Yangtze River flows long and vast,
	Butterflies dance and bees fly, busy in all seasons,
	Recovering the homeland at the Yalu River,
	Washing the execution ground beside Yuhuatai;
	Red flags are planted all over the beautiful rivers and mountains,
	The green blood is always fresh, and the grass and trees are fragrant;
	Even more dyed with Yingying's colorful stones,
	Ten thousand guests cherish and carry them across the ocean.

### 南京，换了人间

专栏：名城赋

　　南京，换了人间
　　夏阳
    高高的山峰上一座座半球形的屋顶，闪耀着银白色的光辉，非常惹人注意。这就是著名的紫金山天文台。人们经过洁净无尘、花木夹道的宽阔的马路或者穿行隧道似的林荫大路攀上这个山峰，站到天文台前，就能放眼眺望起伏的群山，奔流的大江；在江山的环绕之间，一片苍翠青葱的树海；在树海当中，一座雄伟的城池；崭新的房舍密布，高耸的烟囱林立：这就是与祖国许多城市同一步伐前进的南京，绿化了的、美化了的、工业化了的新生的城市南京。
    南京，这个有着两千四百多年历史的城池，有过许多名称：金陵、秣陵、石头、建业、建邺、建康、白下、升州、应天、天京……。这儿有高山——紫金山，深水——扬子江，平原——江淮大平原。这儿有“千里莺啼绿映红”的江南春色。怪不得有八代帝王在这儿建都，先后共计三百六十六年。诸葛亮说：“秣陵地形，钟山龙蟠，石城虎踞，真帝王之都也。”谢眺说：“江南佳丽地，金陵帝王州。”从三国孙吴以来，建都在这儿的有东晋、宋、齐、梁、陈、南唐和明朝朱元璋。蒋介石在1927年叛变了中国的民主革命以后，在这儿建立了反革命的王朝，使南京成为反动统治的中心。日本帝国主义侵略中国期间，也在这儿设立过汉奸汪精卫的傀儡朝廷。南京，这个古老的城池，该有多少辛酸的历史！
    江南佳丽地遭受了如此的噩运，大好河山被反动统治者盘踞着作为压迫人民的中枢。剥削阶级在这儿享乐，在这儿争夺山川形胜，给人民无限的战争苦难，给城池无情无尽的破坏。封建时代的无数诗人，在这儿反复吟咏的，无非是改朝换代的感慨，国破城亡的悲哀。李太白说：“凤去台空江自流”，“烟波江上使人愁”。文天祥说：“从今别却江南日，化作啼鹃带血归。”萨都刺说：“叶落无人松径冷，鬼火高低明灭。”吴梅村说：“可怜一片秦淮月，曾照降幡出石头。”我们可以列举无数的这样的诗篇。诗人是各式各样的，更用着讲亡国皇帝李煜说的“故国不堪回首月明中”了。
    然而，对于人民群众来说，却是坚持了前仆后继革命斗争。是人民真正使“金陵王气黯然收”，终于使这个历史名城最后回到自己的手上。人民做了石头城的主人，并且永远是这儿的主人。1949年4月24日，中国共产党领导的人民解放军，在人民支援下渡过长江，使南京从此换了人间。
    南京的历史，应该由人民来写。这是个光荣的城市，有革命斗争传统的城市。不是吗？岳飞、梁红玉、史可法曾在这里反抗过异族侵略者。这些远事不多说了。一百多年来，中国规模最大历史最久的一次农民运动——太平天国，不是在这儿建立天京共达十一年之久的吗？辛亥革命，孙中山在这儿就任临时大总统，也曾在这儿建立临时首都。更重要的是，这儿在中国共产党领导下，进行了长期的艰苦的有远大理想的革命斗争。雨花台，这就是历史的见证。
    国民党反动派在雨花台屠杀了千千万万革命烈士。雨花台特产的雨花石上，染满了烈士们的鲜血。烈士们用自己的热血，写下了无数可敬可佩的故事，可泣可歌的诗篇。
    他们抛头颅、洒热血，以生命为代价。当我站上雨花台的时候，我总会听到烈士们以视死如归的精神，激昂慷慨的声音，乐观自信的感情，唱着他们的歌：
    生死平常，
    我们有崇高的理想。 
    情愿用生命栽培，
    幸福的花，百世芬芳。
    鲜花开满雨花台，
    ——总有那一天！
    英勇冲锋，
    我们会最后的成功。
    甘心用热血洗染，
    革命的旗，千古鲜红。
    红旗插上南京城，
    ——总有那一天！
    冲破牢房，
    我们要彻底的解放。
    尽情用忠心呼喊，
    胜利的歌，万岁嘹亮。
    凯歌唱遍大中华，
    ——总有那一天！
    来了，这一天来了。南京，换了人间。
    南京，这儿再也不奏哀笳怨角。前进曲，跃进歌，响彻了每个角落。荒台败垒上新建了许多工厂，“落叶无人松径冷”的时代一去不回来了。剥削阶级荒淫无耻、屠杀人民的时代一去不回来了。
    解放南京的时候，我们接受了国民党政府一千一百九十一个单位，官僚机关占80％，算是生产的单位只有三十八个。全市流氓妓女，无业失业的人口三十万。据国民党1948年的统计，全市一百多万人口中，共有九万“茶房”、“阿姨”、“跟班”，产业工人只有两万人。一个化工厂筹建三年多，没有开过一天，一个农业机械公司，八个月生产两部碾米机，大批大批的美国货潮水似的涌来，还不是只有畸形的“繁荣”！
    十年来，南京成了人民的工业城市。建设，建设，建设，不停的建设。从无到有，从小到大，从少到多，从低到高，彻底改造了国民党反动派留下的烂摊子。这儿出现了钢铁厂、化工厂、机械厂、汽车厂、仪器厂……百人以上的工厂，增加了十一倍，五百人以上的工厂，从五个发展到一百多个。在祖国心脏的北京和工业基地的上海，在遥远的新疆和边陲的海南，在黄河的水利工地和新建的西北油田，……还在国外许多地方，都可以看到工业产品上刻印的“南京”字样。原来只有七十四种产品，现在是四千多种了：从载重汽车、拖拉机、发电机、龙门刨、直到电影放映机、收音机和医疗药品。
    生产发展了，经济繁荣了，文化也跟上来了。二十七所新型的高等学校，代替了过去那培养少爷老爷的“中央大学”和“中央政治大学”，以及那企图培养美国洋奴的“金陵大学”和“金陵女子大学”。今天，一所“南京大学”六千多学生，就超过过去国民党统治时期“首都”全部大学生数的一倍。
    人口增加了，交通事业发展了。曾经在城里也是荒凉一片的三十三点四公里周围的大城，填满了房舍，而且在市郊有了新发展。市内的铁道拆除了，移到市外。横跨长江的大桥也已经着手建设了。
    工人、农民、职员、学生……大家积极的劳动，幸福的生活，历代遗留下来的名胜古迹，便成为丰富精神生活和休息的场所。玄武湖和莫愁湖、明孝陵和中山陵、鸡鸣寺和灵谷寺、清凉山和栖霞山、白鹭洲和燕子矶、胭脂井和秦淮河、夫子庙和天王府……这里每个地方都有诗句、传说和故事，供人们吟咏谈说，人民尽情享受欢乐的生活。经过修建整理的名胜之区，山河风景是更美好了，更佳丽了。
    南京建城有二千四百三十一年的历史，解放十年，够不上这段历史的零头。然而这十年的变化，却超过了历史上的几千年。我们简直没法计算这是什么样的跃进速度；万语千言，我们也没法形容南京变化之万一。
    我赶到雨花台去，把喜报连同鲜花送到烈士碑前。我看着毛主席题的巨大的字：“死难烈士万岁！”我说：“烈士们，你们的理想实现了！”
    多少人群潮水似的经常流向雨花台来，他们在这里吸取革命的力量，为南京的更加美好、为祖国向共产主义迈进，还为世界的和平和人类的解放，去斗争，奋勇前进！
    我虽不是诗人，也禁不住心头的激动，唱出了“雨花台颂”：
    滔滔扬子水流长，
    蝶舞蜂飞四季忙，
    鸭绿江边收国土，
    雨花台畔洗刑场；
    红旗遍插河山丽，
    碧血常鲜草木香；
    更染莹莹多彩石，
    万宾珍带过重洋。
