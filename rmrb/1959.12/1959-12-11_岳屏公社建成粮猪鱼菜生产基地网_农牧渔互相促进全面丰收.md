    Yueping Commune Establishes Grain, Pig, Fish, and Vegetable Production Base Network
    Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fishery Promote Each Other for Overall Bumper Harvest
    (Our Dispatch) The Yueping People's Commune in Hengnan County, Hunan Province, has conscientiously implemented the policy of "grain taking the lead, overall leap forward," adopting a method of combining grain, pigs, fish, and vegetables to promote each other, thereby achieving an overall bumper harvest in agricultural and sideline production.
    Yueping Commune, located in the western suburbs of Hengyang City, has always been one of the main production bases for non-staple foods in the city, and the increase in production has been even greater in the year since communization. As of now, the commune has more than 36,000 pigs in stock, an increase of more than 14,000 since the early days of communization, achieving one pig per mu. The area of fish farming has increased from more than 1,700 mu last year to more than 2,900 mu, and the output of fresh fish has reached 19,000 dan, an increase of 7,000 dan compared to the same period last year. The vegetable planting area has expanded 5.9 times compared to last year, reaching more than 19,000 mu, and the output has reached more than 439,000 dan, an increase of more than 234,000 dan compared to last year. The production of other poultry has also increased about twofold compared to last year. This year alone, the total income from pigs, fish, and vegetables reached 3.7 million yuan, accounting for 53.2% of the total annual agricultural and sideline output value.
    The high-speed development of non-staple food production in this commune is primarily due to the full utilization of the superiority of the people's commune. Last winter, the commune party committee made an overall plan based on the soil distribution of the entire commune, making unified arrangements. Without affecting grain production, the production bases for non-staple foods such as pigs, fish, and vegetables were expanded. These bases were organically linked, ensuring that pig farms were near rice fields, vegetable gardens were next to pig farms, and vegetable gardens were close to fish ponds. In this way, pig manure could be used nearby to fertilize fields, raise fish, and grow vegetables, and pond fertilizer water could be used to irrigate fields, water vegetables, and raise aquatic feed, which could then be used to feed pigs. This is effectively on-site production and on-site utilization, achieving mutual promotion. According to statistics, the commune produced 580,000 dan of vegetables this year, of which leafy vegetables accounted for 20%, about 116,000 dan, providing more than 3,000 jin of green and refined feed for each pig. The commune developed 45,000 pigs, producing 1.8 million dan of pig manure annually, ensuring that more than 50,000 mu of farmland (including more than 37,000 mu of rice fields) received an additional 20 dan of refined pig manure and urine fertilizer per mu, and also provided 800,000 dan of pig manure feed for fresh fish. The more than 2,900 mu of fish ponds accumulated 9 million dan of organic pond mud, providing an average of 180 dan of fertilized pond mud per mu of cultivated land, and a large amount of fertilized mud was used to grow vegetables, while the fertilized water in the ponds was used to irrigate fields and water vegetables. Therefore, this year, the per mu yield of the 43,500 mu of early, mid, and late rice planted in the entire commune increased from 624 jin last year to 713 jin; the per mu yield of more than 10,000 mu of vegetables increased by 7,600 jin compared to last year, with an average per mu yield reaching 21,600 jin; and the per mu yield of marketable fish increased by 42% compared to last year.
    The combination of grain, pig, fish, and vegetable production bases makes it easier to concentrate professional management. The commune transferred a total of 6,700 people to organize seven professional teams to grow vegetables, arranged 1,300 people to form fifteen professional teams to raise fish, and established 168 pig-raising professional teams, making the best use of people's talents and land resources, so that the entire production forms a closely connected base network, thereby saving more than 68,000 transportation labor units for transporting fertilizer and feed.

    岳屏公社建成粮猪鱼菜生产基地网
    农牧渔互相促进全面丰收
    本报讯　湖南衡南县岳屏人民公社认真贯彻了粮食带头、全面跃进的方针，采取粮、猪、鱼、菜四结合的办法，互相促进，从而获得农副业生产全面大丰收。
    岳屏公社在衡阳市西郊，历来就是市区主要副食品生产基地之一，特别是公社化后这一年来增产幅度更大。到目前为止，这个公社存栏生猪已达三万六千多头，比公社化初期增加一万四千多头，实现了一亩地一头猪。养鱼水面由去年的一千七百多亩增加到二千九百多亩，出塘鲜鱼已达一万九千担，比去年同期增加七千担。蔬菜种植面积比去年扩大了五点九倍，达到一万九千多亩，已产菜四十三万九千多担，比去年增加二十三万四千多担。其他家禽生产也都较去年增加一倍左右。今年仅猪鱼菜三项的总收入就达三百七十万元，占全年农副业总产值的53.2％。
    这个公社副食品生产的高速度发展，首先是充分发挥了人民公社的优越性。去年冬天公社党委就根据全公社土质分布情况作了全面规划，统一安排。在不影响粮食生产的前提下，扩大了猪、鱼、菜等副食品生产基地。并把这些基地有机地联系起来，做到稻田附近有猪场，猪场旁边有菜园，菜园靠近鱼塘边。这样，可以就近利用猪粪肥田、养鱼、种菜，也可以利用鱼塘肥水灌田、浇菜和放养水生饲料，这些饲料又可用来喂猪。这实际上是就地出产就地利用，达到相互促进的作用。据统计：今年全社产菜五十八万担，其中脚叶菜占20％，约十一万六千多担，为每头猪提供了三千多斤青精饲料。全社发展生猪四万五千头，年产猪粪一百八十万担，保证了五万来亩耕地（其中稻田三万七千多亩），每亩增施了二十担猪粪尿精肥，还为鲜鱼提供了八十万担猪粪饵料。而这二千九百多亩鱼塘又积累了有机质塘泥九百万担，为每亩耕地平均增施了一百八十担肥塘泥，并有大量的肥泥种菜，塘里的肥水又用来灌田、浇菜。因此，今年全公社种植的四万三千五百亩早中晚稻，亩产由去年的六百二十四斤增加到七百一十三斤；一万多亩蔬菜亩产量比去年净增七千六百斤，平均亩产达到二万一千六百斤；成鱼亩产比去年增长42％。
    由于粮猪鱼菜等生产基地的结合，更加便于集中专业管理，全社共抽调六千七百多人组织七个专业队种菜，安排一千三百人组成十五个专业队养鱼，又建立养猪专业队一百六十八个，做到人尽其材地尽其用，使整个生产形成一个密切联系的基地网，从而节省了运肥送料的运输劳力六万八千多个。
