Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta. Mrs. Arudji Kartawinata, wife of the Second Deputy Speaker of the Indonesian Parliament, recently recounted her impressions of visiting China to a reporter from "Republika" newspaper.

Mrs. Arudji pointed out that the people's commune, as a new form of Chinese social organization, is very natural. The people's commune can improve agricultural technology and greatly increase production. In the people's commune, children live very happy lives.

Regarding the issues between China and Indonesia, she expressed the hope that they will be resolved wisely in accordance with friendly principles. She pointed out, "We must strive to avoid disputes that only benefit the enemy."

Indonesian parliamentarian Hong Qianlie, renowned doctor Li Quanxin, and Indonesian-China Friendship Association worker Gani Binadarada reported on their impressions of visiting China at a meeting held by the Indonesian Youth Consultation Association on November 26.

They all praised the superiority of the people's commune and refuted the slander against it. Dr. Li Quanxin pointed out that in the people's commune, men, women, old and young are happy. He also cited an example, "When we took the train in Shenzhen, the railways on both sides were flooded, but a month later, when we returned home, there was no more flooding. What we saw were green crops. This is an example showing the great power of the people's commune."

Hong Qianlie also said that the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people has undergone fundamental changes today. They are all single-mindedly and selflessly building the country for the happiness of the people of the whole country. They are all proud to be able to contribute to the construction of the motherland.

In his report, Gani Binadarada praised the endless energy of Chinese youth in various professions, their rich and colorful lives, and the unity of all ethnic groups in China.

He pointed out that since liberation, ethnic minorities have made great progress in economy, culture and other aspects. They live very happy lives in the big family of the Chinese people. All ethnic minorities in China enjoy equal rights and obligations.

    中国和印度尼西亚应避免发生争端  两国之间的问题本着友好原则解决
    新华社雅加达电　印度尼西亚国会第二副议长阿鲁季·卡塔威纳塔的夫人最近访问中国后对“共和国报”记者叙述了她访问中国的印象。
    阿鲁季夫人指出，作为中国社会组织的新的形式，人民公社是很自然的。人民公社能够改进农业技术，大大增加生产。在人民公社里，儿童过着非常幸福的生活。
    关于中国和印度尼西亚两国间问题，她表示希望，将本着友好的原则，明智地加以解决。她指出，“我们必须努力避免发生只有利于敌人的争端。”
    印度尼西亚议员洪谦烈、著名医生李全信和印度尼西亚—中国友好协会工作人员加尼·比纳达不拉达11月26日在印度尼西亚青年谘询协会举办的会议上报告了他们的访华观感。
    他们都赞扬人民公社的优越性，并且驳斥了对人民公社的诽谤。李全信医生指出，在人民公社里，男女老少都是幸福的。他还举例说，“当我们在深圳上火车时，铁路两旁被洪水淹没，但是一个月以后，在我们回国时，那里已经没有洪水了。我们看到的是碧绿的庄稼。这是表明人民公社巨大力量的一个例子。”
    洪谦烈还说，中国人民的精神面貌今天发生了根本的变化。他们都在为全国人民的幸福，一心一意地、无私地建设着国家。他们都以能够为祖国的建设作出贡献而骄傲。
    加尼·比纳达不拉达在报告中称赞中国各种职业的青年的无穷无尽的精力、他们的丰富多彩的生活以及中国各民族的团结。
    他指出，自从解放以来，少数民族在经济、文化和其它方面已经取得了巨大的进展。他们在中国人民的大家庭中过着非常幸福的生活。中国各少数民族都享有同等的权利和义务。
