Xinhua News Agency report: The Yangdachengzi People's Commune in Huaide County, Jilin Province, has developed its domestic rabbit population to over 100,200, a sixteenfold increase compared to the beginning of the year. Currently, each management area in the commune has an average of six collective rabbit farms, with an average of 18 rabbits per household and 3.2 rabbits per person.

This commune, bordering the grasslands to the west, has historically had many farmers relying on rabbit raising for their livelihood. After communization, the commune's Party committee gave sufficient attention to rabbit raising when comprehensively planning the five sectors of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishing.

The development of domestic rabbit production has not only increased the amount of fur and meat supplied to the country but has also brought significant changes to the commune's economic life. According to calculations by the commune's supply and marketing cooperative, the total value of local and sideline product purchases from January to November this year increased by 65.7% compared to the same period last year, with the value of domestic rabbit purchases accounting for 35.7% of this increase.

    杨大城子公社家兔增加十六倍
    据新华社讯　吉林省怀德县杨大城子人民公社的家兔已发展到十万零两千多只，比年初增加了十六倍。现在，全公社每个管理区平均有六个集体养兔场，平均每户有兔十八只，每人有兔三点二只。
    这个公社西邻草原，历来有不少农民依靠养兔维持生活。公社化后，公社党委在全面规划农林牧副渔五业生产时，对养兔给予了足够的重视。
    家兔生产的发展，不仅给国家增加了大量的皮毛、肉食，而且给这个公社的经济生活带来了很大变化。据公社供销部计算，今年1至11月份的土副产品收购总值比去年同期增加65.7％，其中收购家兔金额即占35.7％。
