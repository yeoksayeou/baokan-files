Xinhua News Agency Report:
    To strive for all large livestock to spend the winter well-fed and pregnant, laying the foundation for great development next year, is one of the important tasks of livestock production nationwide. At present, the winter breeding and livestock protection work of large livestock in various places is being done very well. By the end of November, in provinces and regions such as Henan, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Liaoning, more than 70% of the eligible female livestock were already pregnant. In the special districts of Xiangtan, Shaoyang, Hengyang, and Chenxian in Hunan, and Nanyang and Xinyang in Henan, as well as the counties of Dongzhi in Anhui, Xinghua in Jiangsu, Weinan in Shaanxi, Pingchang in Sichuan, Canshan in Shandong, and Qinshui and Ningwu in Shanxi, the proportion of pregnant livestock to eligible female livestock has reached as high as 80% to 90% or more. The condition of livestock in various places is also generally better than in the same period in previous years, generally having eight or nine parts of fatness.
    Strengthening winter breeding and livestock protection is an important link in the development of large livestock. Large livestock mostly have one calf per year, and under normal circumstances, the vast majority of female livestock must be pregnant through the winter to ensure the great development of livestock in the second year. However, winter is cold and freezing, which can easily cause pregnant livestock to miscarry and large livestock to become weak, injured, or die. In response to this situation, various localities have strengthened winter breeding and winter protection work for large livestock this year.
    Since the beginning of winter, various localities have vigorously broken the conservative idea that breeding cannot be done in winter, and have seized the winter breeding work, requiring all female livestock to be bred and all to be successfully impregnated. This year, Hebei Province successfully bred more than 100,000 female livestock in October alone. The conception rate of large livestock in Qinghai Province reached over 80%. The vast areas south of the Yangtze River have warmer climates and better conditions for winter breeding, and there are more areas with winter breeding habits. In Guizhou and Fujian, more than 60% of eligible female livestock were pregnant in November.
    This year, all provinces and regions have paid special attention to protecting livestock to spend the winter well-fed, and most areas in Northeast and North China have already inspected or are inspecting livestock protection work. Their slogan is: ensure that every livestock is healthy and strong, none are weak, and ensure that every pregnant livestock is safe, none miscarry. To this end, people's communes in various places have generally strengthened the feeding and management of large livestock and have appropriately reserved feed as needed. The communes in Shanxi, Shandong, and Inner Mongolia have generally prepared winter fodder for large livestock. By mid-November in Henan Province, more than 95% of the livestock sheds in the province were basically able to keep out snow from above, prevent dampness from below, and prevent wind from all sides. Recently, the province conducted another in-depth inspection of livestock protection work, plugged the loopholes in livestock protection work, inspected and repaired at the same time, and added stoves, warm water tanks, and windproof door curtains to hundreds of thousands of livestock sheds, and also adjusted some feed among each other according to the surplus and shortage of winter feed in various places.

### 让大家畜满怀满膘过冬  各地人民公社狠抓大牲畜冬配和护养工作

　　让大家畜满怀满膘过冬
    各地人民公社狠抓大牲畜冬配和护养工作
    据新华社讯　力争大家畜满怀满膘过冬，打下明年大发展的根基，这是当前全国畜牧生产的重要任务之一。目前，各地大家畜的冬配保畜工作作得很好。到11月底，河南、甘肃、新疆、辽宁等省区，70％以上的适龄母畜已经怀孕。湖南的湘潭、邵阳、衡阳、郴县和河南的南阳、信阳等专区，安徽的东至、江苏的兴化、陕西的渭南、四川的平昌、山东的苍山以及山西的沁水、宁武等县，孕畜占适龄母畜的比例都已高达80％到90％以上。各地牲畜现在的膘情也大都比往年同期好，一般都有八、九成膘。
    加强冬配和保畜工作是发展大家畜的重要环节。大家畜大都是一年一胎，一胎一仔，在通常情况下，必须有绝大部分的母畜怀胎过冬，才能保证第二年牲畜的大发展。但冬季因天寒地冻，很容易使孕畜流产和大畜瘦弱伤亡。针对着这种情况，今年各地都加强了大家畜的冬配和冬季保护工作。
    入冬以来，各地都大破冬季不能配种的保守思想，抓紧冬配工作，要求母畜全配、全准。今年河北省在10月份一个月就配准了十万多头母畜。青海省大家畜受胎率达80％以上。长江流域以南广大地区气候较暖，冬配条件好，有冬配习惯的地区也较多。贵州、福建11月份适龄母畜怀孕的已占60％以上。
    各省区今年对保护牲畜满膘过冬工作特别重视，东北、华北大部分地区都已经或正在检查保畜工作。他们的口号是：保证牲畜头头健壮，一头不瘦弱，保证孕畜头头安全，一头不流产。为此各地人民公社一般都加强了大家畜的饲养管理工作，按需要适当留了饲料。山西、山东、内蒙古的公社一般都为大家畜准备了过冬的饲草。河南省到11月中旬，全省95％以上的畜舍基本上做到上不漏雪、下不潮湿，四边不透风。最近，这个省又深入地检查了一次保畜工作，堵塞保畜工作的漏洞，边检查、边整修，在几十万处的畜舍中增设了火炉、温水缸、防风门帘，并且根据各地过冬饲料盈缺情况互相调剂了一部分饲料。
