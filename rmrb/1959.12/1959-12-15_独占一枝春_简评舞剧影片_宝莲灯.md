    Alone Possessing a Branch of Spring
    ——A Brief Review of the Dance Drama Film "Lotus Lantern"
    Mei Qian
    The film "Lotus Lantern," adapted from the dance drama, truly stands out among the diverse celebratory films. It is like possessing a branch of spring alone in a splendid garden of flowers, adding a rather unique color to it. Dance drama is a relatively young art form, and "Lotus Lantern" is also China's first color dance drama film. Therefore, its achievements are all the more worthy of cherishing. Its characteristic lies in the merging of dance drama and film, which is a new attempt.

    Commendably, this film, in its use of dance vocabulary, musical melody and rhythm, the selection of film shots, and the creation of special effects, adheres to a common goal: to faithfully serve the development of the plot, the portrayal of characters' thoughts and feelings, and the dramatic conflict. Therefore, these artistic expressions, each with its own independence, can achieve harmonious unity in the entire film. They do not interfere with or cancel each other out in a self-serving way but complement each other, giving a harmonious impression. "Lotus Lantern" is a well-known mythological story. The unwavering love between the Holy Mother of Mount Hua and Liu Yanchang, and the moving story of Chen Xiang splitting the mountain to rescue his mother, are deeply imprinted in the hearts of many viewers. This also represents the bold imagination and creation of the working people in feudal society. The Holy Mother of Mount Hua is an ancient female figure with a rebellious character. Unwilling to accept the coldness and loneliness of the celestial world, she yearns for the happy life of the human world. She and Liu Yanchang fall in love at first sight, and their hearts are in tune. Thus, she breaks through the spiritual shackles imposed upon her by the rulers of divine authority and breaks through the boundaries between humans and gods, fighting unyieldingly to pursue happiness and love. This precisely reflects the positive attitude of the ancient working people towards life and their strong desire for freedom and happiness. Erlang Shen and his henchman, Howling Celestial Dog, as protectors of divine authority, carry out insidious sabotage and brutal suppression against them, thus unfolding a life-and-death struggle between good and evil. The Holy Mother of Mount Hua never surrenders, and she is finally rescued by their son Chen Xiang, who splits open the thousands of towering peaks of Mount Hua. Husband and wife are reunited, and mother and son are reunited. The Holy Mother of Mount Hua, who launched an attack and resistance against feudal divine authority, gains the final victory. This struggle is a reflection of the real class struggle in feudal society and fully demonstrates the working people's firm belief that feudal forces are bound to collapse. This is the most popular core of this traditional mythological story. The film tightly grasps this anti-feudal main line, discarding some of the religious and superstitious dross and superfluous branches mixed in it, weeding out the old to bring forth the new, making it a beautiful myth full of combat significance and romantic color. This adaptation work is effective in bringing forth the new from the old.

    Comrades Zhao Qing, who plays the Holy Mother of Mount Hua, and Fu Zhaoxiang, who plays Liu Yanchang, as well as the actors who play Chen Xiang, Erlang Shen, and Howling Celestial Dog, seem to have worked hard in studying and inheriting the performing arts of traditional opera and have laid a certain foundation. They have absorbed rich dance language from traditional opera and folk dance, and they use it nearly purely and naturally. The advantage is that their dance movements do not only stay at the level of pursuing the beauty of external rhythm or static sculptural modeling, but they use these movements to portray the changes in the characters' moods and to show the inner world of the characters in a relatively delicate way. They do not simply piece together or simply simulate, but they understand and integrate it, making the dance movements an artistic means of expressing specific thoughts and feelings. Originally, from the audience's point of view, people appreciate the "drama," the psychological activities of the characters, rather than the simple "dance," the simple skills. On this point, I think Comrade Zhao Qing's performance is quite original. The several long silk dances of the Holy Mother of Mount Hua have distinct changes, expressing complex emotional content. At the beginning, she walks down from the shrine, dragging these two long streamers. She expresses her depressed, lonely, and melancholy feelings with a slow rhythm and light movements. Her eyes are stagnant, her eyes are deeply frowned, and the gently fluttering streamers seem to be an extension of her emotions. When she opens the window, enjoys the bright spring light outside the window, and reaches out to pick a flower, the exuberant spring spirit fluctuates in her chest, and her face also shows a layer of youthful joy between her eyebrows. At this time, the waving of the long silk is light and floating, as if it is the beating of her pulse. In her and Liu Yanchang's love-making dance, this pair of long streamers is transformed into wings born on both sides of her armpits, allowing her to fly freely, as agile as a swimming dragon and as graceful as a startled swan, fully expressing her exuberant and joyful emotions. This change of dance posture more delicately embodies the ups and downs of the Holy Mother of Mount Hua's inner emotions, giving people a deep infection. This is just one example. In this dance drama film with national style, we not only appreciate its harmony and unity in art, but we also can't help but feel sincere joy for the unique attainments of these young actors in dance art.

    独占一枝春
    ——简评舞剧影片“宝莲灯”
    梅阡
    根据舞剧拍摄的影片“宝莲灯”，在丰富多采的献礼影片中确能别具一格。恰如在灿烂似锦的百花丛中，独占一枝春；并为之增添了一点颇不平常的颜色。舞剧是比较年青的艺术，“宝莲灯”也是我国第一部彩色的舞剧片。因之它的成就就更加值得珍视。它的特点是要把舞剧、电影熔于一炉，这是个新的尝试。
    可喜的是这部影片在舞蹈语汇的运用，音乐的旋律与节奏，电影镜头的选择和特技的创造等等都能遵循着一个共同的目的，那就是围绕着故事情节的发展，忠实地为了刻划人物思想感情的变化和戏剧冲突而服务。因之这些颇具独立性的艺术表现手段在整个影片中能够取得调协的统一，它们并没有各自为政地互相干扰或抵消，而是相辅相成，给人以谐和的印象。“宝莲灯”是个大家熟知的神话故事。三圣母和刘彦昌之间坚贞不渝的爱情，沉香劈山救母动人的情节，在许多观众的心里印象甚深。这也是在封建社会里劳动人民大胆的想像和创造。三圣母是个具有叛逆性格的古代妇女形象。她不甘于神仙世界的冷酷和寂寞，向往着人间的幸福生活。她和刘彦昌一见钟情，心意契合，于是突破神权统治者所加于她精神上的束缚，突破人神之间的界限，百折不挠地为追求幸福与爱情而斗争。这正反映了古代劳动人民对生活的积极态度，对于自由、幸福强烈的渴望。作为神权统治维护者的二郎神和帮凶哮天犬，却对他们进行了阴险破坏和残暴的镇压，从而展开了一场生与死、善与恶的搏斗。三圣母始终不曾降服，最后由他们的儿子沉香劈开那千重万仞的华山救出来。夫妻重合，母子团圆，对封建神权进行冲击和反抗的三圣母获得最后的胜利。这个斗争正是封建社会现实的阶级斗争的一种反映，并充分显示了劳动人民对封建势力必然崩溃的坚定信念。这是这个传统神话故事最具有人民性的核心。影片紧紧抓住了这一条反封建的主线，摈弃揉杂于其中的一些宗教迷信的糟粕和多余的支蔓，去芜存菁，使它成为一个富有战斗意义和浪漫色彩的优美神话，这个编导工作在推陈出新上作得是有成效的。
    扮演三圣母的赵青同志和扮演刘彦昌的傅兆祥同志，以及扮演沉香、二郎神、哮天犬的演员们在学习继承传统戏曲的表演艺术方面，看来都曾经下过勤学苦练的工夫，打下了一定的基础。他们从传统戏曲和民间舞蹈中吸取了丰富的舞蹈语言，而且运用得近于纯熟自然，好处在于他们的舞蹈动作并不仅只停留在追求外在韵律的优美或静止的雕塑造型上，而是用这些动作来刻划了人物的心情变化，比较细腻地展示了人物的内心世界。他们不是生拼硬凑或简单的模拟，而是经过心领神会与融会贯通，使舞蹈动作成为表现具体思想感情的艺术手段。本来，从观众的角度言，人们欣赏的是“戏”，是人物心理的活动；而不是单纯的“舞”，单纯的技艺。在这一点上我觉得赵青同志的表演就颇有独创。在三圣母的几段长绸舞中，就具有鲜明的变化，表达了复杂的情绪内容。开始她从神龛上走下来，拖着这两条长长的飘带，她以缓慢的节奏，轻盈的动作，抒发着她那抑郁孤寂而苦闷的胸怀，目光凝滞，双目深蹙，而那轻轻飘曳的绸带，似乎成为她这种情绪的延伸。当她推开窗子，领略着窗外明媚的春光，并伸手采摘了一朵鲜花之后，盎然的春意在她胸臆间起伏动荡，脸上也眉展眼舒透出一层青春的喜悦，这时长绸的挥舞，轻灵浮动，好像是她脉搏的跳动。在她和刘彦昌定情的双舞中，这一双长长的飘带又转化成生于两腋的翅膀，使她自由地飞翔起来，矫若游龙，翩若惊鸿，充分地表现了她那奔放欢腾的感情。这种舞姿的变化，较细致地体现了三圣母内心情感的起伏，给人以深刻的感染。这不过是其中的一个例子。在这部富有民族风格的舞剧影片里，我们不仅欣赏到它在艺术上的谐和与统一，而且也不禁为这些青年演员在舞蹈艺术上独特的造诣而感到由衷的喜悦。
