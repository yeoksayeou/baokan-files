Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 22nd: "Lao Patriotic News" published on December 16th a statement by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party regarding the current situation in Laos. The statement calls on the people of all ethnicities and strata in Laos to unite and struggle against the conspiracies of US imperialism and its running dogs. The statement demands that the government reorganized by Sananikone strictly implement the existing Constitution, the Geneva Accords, and the Vientiane Agreements, to resolve the Laotian issue through peaceful consultation, so as to build Laos into a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, prosperous, and unified country.

The statement reiterates the Lao Patriotic Front Party's consistent position on the Laotian situation: "Implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, unite all ethnic groups, all social strata, and all patriotic and peace-loving political parties, jointly implement the policy of national harmony and a unified country, and implement a genuine policy of peace and neutrality in building a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos."

Regarding the new Laotian cabinet, the statement points out that although the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" did not participate in the new cabinet, they have not abandoned their attempts to realize the conspiracies of US imperialism. Therefore, the people of all ethnicities and strata in Laos must be vigilant, strengthen unity, and struggle against all their conspiracies.

The statement says that the entire Laotian people are watching the new cabinet, because this new cabinet is still headed by Phoui Sananikone as Prime Minister. Sananikone controls many important departments and has announced that the political line of the new cabinet has not changed in any way. Everyone knows that Sananikone has undermined the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, disrupted national harmony and national unity, and brought war and disaster to the motherland.

The statement points out that, in order to resolve the Laotian issue, it is first necessary to struggle for the realization of the following demands of the Lao Patriotic Front Party: (1) Stop the civil war, abolish the emergency decrees promulgated throughout the country, stop the "sweeps" and persecution of the people, withdraw the Royal Army conducting "sweeps" in various places, and normalize the situation in Laos; (2) Respect the existing Constitution, support the Royal Family, restore the power of the National Assembly, restore the qualifications of the deputies representing the Lao Patriotic Front Party so that they can attend this special session of the National Assembly in a timely manner. Oppose extending the term of government privileges, guarantee the democratic freedoms of the people, oppose conspiracies to amend the Constitution and electoral laws, and oppose the introduction of anti-democratic proposals; (3) Immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party who are being illegally imprisoned; (4) Immediately stop accepting US military aid and demand the withdrawal of US military personnel from Laos; (5) Implement a genuine policy of peace and neutrality. Establish relations with countries with different political systems on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Do not participate in any military alliances. Accept aid from countries willing to help Laos unconditionally.

The statement says that, in the face of the reorganization of the Laotian cabinet and the convening of a special session of the National Assembly, the Lao Patriotic Front Party insists on remaining loyal to the policy of national harmony and a unified motherland for the lofty interests of the motherland and the ardent wishes of the entire people, and is always ready to hold negotiations with the Lao Royal Government to resolve the Laotian issue through peaceful consultation.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the special session of the Laotian National Assembly opened in Vientiane on the 17th. King Savang Vatthana of Laos attended the opening ceremony and delivered a speech.

This special session was held after the reorganization of the cabinet by Laotian Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone. Sananikone submitted the list of the new cabinet to the King on the 14th. The new cabinet does not include members of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests."

The new cabinet has six ministers and five deputy ministers. Phoui Sananikone serves as Prime Minister of the cabinet, concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Veterans Affairs, Rural Affairs, Propaganda, Youth and Sports, and Katay Don Sasorith serves as Deputy Prime Minister, concurrently Minister of Interior, Religious Affairs, and Justice. On the 19th, the Laotian National Assembly passed a vote of confidence in the reorganized Sananikone government.
