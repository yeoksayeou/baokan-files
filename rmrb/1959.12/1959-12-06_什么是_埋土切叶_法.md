    What is the "Bury Soil and Cut Leaves" Method?

    The "bury soil and cut leaves" method is a method adopted by the masses in Shaanxi to prevent and control wheat stripe rust. The specific practice of "burying soil and cutting leaves" is: first cut off and bury the diseased wheat leaves, and then cut off all the leaves of the wheat plants within one foot around the diseased plant. When a rust transmission center is discovered, the diseased wheat leaves at the center should also be buried first, and then all the wheat leaves within a three-foot radius around the center should be cut off. The masses in Shaanxi have summarized the four major benefits of this method from practical application: it eliminates germs and prevents and controls thoroughly; it is simple and easy to master; it is effective quickly; and it does not cost money.

    什么是“埋土切叶”法
    “埋土切叶”法是陕西群众采用的一种防治小麦条锈病的方法。“埋土切叶”的具体作法是：先把发病的麦叶切除埋掉，然后把病株周围一尺以内麦株的叶子全部割下来。发现锈病传病中心的时候，也同样先把发病中心的麦叶埋掉，随后把中心周围三尺范围的麦叶全部割掉。陕西群众从实际运用中总结出这种方法的四大好处：消灭了病菌，防治彻底；方法简便，容易掌握；收效快；不花钱。
