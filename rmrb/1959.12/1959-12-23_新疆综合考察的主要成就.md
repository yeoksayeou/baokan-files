    The Natural Features of Xinjiang and the Achievements of the Comprehensive Survey

    The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region occupies one-sixth of China's land area and is extremely rich in natural resources. It possesses not only superior conditions for developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, but also the huge potential of mineral deposits and power necessary for industrial development. According to preliminary estimates of currently known resources, the region has nearly 100 million mu of arable land, more than 400,000 square kilometers of year-round pastureland for grazing, and original forests on mountain slopes and along major rivers that still hold more than 170 million cubic meters of timber. In terms of mineral resources, petroleum, coal, non-ferrous metals, and rare metals are all of national significance. Xinjiang has a dry climate and relatively few water resources, but the total natural effective annual runoff in the region is still 75 billion cubic meters, which is far greater than the total runoff of the entire Yellow River basin. In addition, there are extremely large reserves of alpine glaciers and underground water sources. As for the heat resources required for crops, they are also quite sufficient in the plains. Therefore, from the long-term perspective of comprehensive development and utilization, all sectors of the national economy have extremely broad prospects for development. Of course, Xinjiang's natural conditions are also very complex. It occupies a large area of 400,000 square kilometers of desert, and the area of arid Gobi is also considerable. Coupled with the exceptionally dry climate and extreme temperature differences, the Turpan Depression, which is below sea level in the region, has recorded the highest absolute temperature in the country (47.8°C), while Fuyun in Altay is the "cold pole" of the country with the lowest absolute temperature (-50.8°C). In addition, there are strong evaporation and seepage, frequent wind and sand, and severe soil salinization. These unfavorable conditions have a great negative impact on production development. It can be said that in our socialist era, Xinjiang is both a place where development and construction have great potential and a major target for transforming nature.

    The purpose of the Xinjiang Comprehensive Survey is to accurately determine the distribution patterns of Xinjiang's unique natural conditions, study the full utilization of various natural resources and the rational allocation of productive forces, with particular emphasis on agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy construction, to provide a scientific basis for the preparation of long-term national economic development plans, and to formulate corresponding outline construction plans.

    For the past four years, the survey team has conducted extensive route surveys and typical investigations throughout Xinjiang, from the Altay Mountains in the north to the Kunlun Mountains in the south, each year according to different regions and key research questions, in the form of comprehensive organizations including relevant disciplines. For major research projects, such as saline-alkali soil improvement, on-site experimental research has also been carried out in conjunction with state farms. Although the survey work has not yet been completed, through such extensive and comprehensive on-site surveys, and comprehensive analysis and research from various disciplines, a large amount of scientific data has been accumulated for areas lacking research, and the nature and distribution patterns of the special natural conditions in Xinjiang's arid areas have been preliminarily identified. New estimates and evaluations have been made of water and soil resources closely related to production development, and a deeper study has been conducted on the soil salinization process and its complex improvement conditions. Comprehensive investigations have also been conducted on runoff regulation, river diversion, and rational development of water and soil resources in several key construction areas in the future. On-site investigations and evaluations have also been conducted on natural feed bases for the development of animal husbandry and the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry. Based on the research on these key issues, combined with the survey team's analysis of the natural conditions and the current status of agricultural production configuration in various regions of Xinjiang, preliminary research on natural regionalization and agricultural regionalization has been further carried out, and suggestions have been made on the direction of agricultural development and major technical measures in different regions of the autonomous region, laying the foundation for future comprehensive scientific summarization and constructive plans.

    Estimates and Evaluation of Water and Soil Resources in Xinjiang

    Xinjiang is located in an extremely dry inland basin with very little rainfall. Not only does 98% of the region's cultivated land rely entirely on irrigation, but water supply is often a key issue for the development of animal husbandry, the establishment of cities and industrial and mining enterprises, and the construction of transportation roads. Therefore, analyzing the formation of runoff, hydrogeological conditions, and accurate estimation and evaluation of water volume in various parts of the autonomous region is of great significance.

    Because Xinjiang has a large area of reclaimable wasteland, the surface runoff is, on the whole, not sufficient. Moreover, the distribution of water and soil resources is very uneven in different regions. For example, the water volume in the Yanqi Basin of the Kaidu River basin accounts for 5.9% of the total water volume in Xinjiang, while the arable land that can be developed accounts for only 1.7% of the total in Xinjiang. Conversely, the water in the Manas River area accounts for 4.8% of the total water volume in Xinjiang, while the arable land that can be developed accounts for more than 11% of the total in Xinjiang. As for the interannual variation of water volume and the coefficient of variation of annual runoff, because the water volume of rivers mainly relies on the melting of alpine glaciers and seasonal snow as the main supply source, it is smaller and more guaranteed than that of rivers in eastern China. However, the amount of snow in winter and the level and stability of temperature before and after spring sowing have a great impact on the amount of water coming, and spring drought is a fairly common phenomenon. Summer floods, especially in southern Xinjiang, come on fiercely, and it is necessary to prevent floods and store water for use. At the same time, due to the wide distribution of coarse-grained alluvial material in the piedmont area, the seepage is very serious. Often, when water diversion channels pass through these gravel Gobi, water loss per kilometer can be as high as 2%-3%. The large amount of seepage loss of surface runoff makes the dynamic reserves of groundwater extremely rich. Through hydrological and geographical river channel surveys, geological and geomorphological structure investigations, hydrogeological key drilling and water quality analysis, the survey team understood the runoff formation process in various places, the transformation relationship between surface water and groundwater, and the distribution patterns of groundwater dynamics and mineralization types. At the same time, based on a comprehensive analysis of moisture data, the flow of major rivers was extended and interpolated by using the correlation between flow and temperature and other methods to meet the requirements of engineering design, and the total runoff of Xinjiang and various regions was calculated. If most of the total runoff in Xinjiang is controlled and utilized, the existing cultivated land area can be expanded by more than twice. As for groundwater resources, a rough estimate was also made based on the investigation and utilization of several hydrological test data. The dynamic reserves in Xinjiang, excluding Altay, Yili and Tacheng areas, amount to 16.3 billion cubic meters, accounting for about one-third of the total surface runoff in Xinjiang. This is a huge wealth that has not yet been developed and utilized. At the same time, it was determined that the Junggar Basin, the Turpan Depression and the Kashgar Delta are artesian basins with better utilization conditions, and the water for many cities and industries in the future can also rely on groundwater.

    The correct estimation and evaluation of land resources is another major issue for rational reclamation. Xinjiang has a large area of reclaimable wasteland and is one of the key areas for large-scale land reclamation in the country. However, because these lands are distributed in closed and semi-closed basins in the interior and have been undergoing their unique geochemical and repeated salinization processes in a dry environment for a long time, not only is salinization common in the soil, but there are also different complex types such as sulfate, sodium chloride, nitrate, and soda, and the salt content is rarely seen in the world. The upper and middle parts of the alluvial fans and deltas, where the salt content is lighter, the groundwater level is low, and the drainage conditions are better, have often been reclaimed and colonized by local farmers. Now the target of newly cultivated land has to face the lower parts of the alluvial fan edge and the alluvial plain with heavier salt accumulation. Since liberation, especially the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, have carried out large-scale reclamation in extremely harsh natural environments and established hundreds of farms, achieving great results in increasing cotton and grain production for the country. In the process of transforming nature through production practice, they encountered many difficulties, especially the struggle against secondary salinization. A small number of farms not only suffered from serious alkali damage, with crop yields declining year by year, resulting in losses, but also had to be forced to abandon large areas of cultivated land that had already been reclaimed. Therefore, a correct evaluation of land resources has become a top priority. If utilization is unreasonable, it will not only hinder the further development of agricultural production, but also damage land resources. Therefore, the survey team regarded saline-alkali soil improvement as a major central issue and carried out a comprehensive land resource evaluation work. According to the complexity of the soil formation process in the plain area of Xinjiang, it is impossible to simply consider the current properties of the soil itself and whether the terrain of the reclamation area is flat or not, but should focus on analyzing the ease of soil improvement in different geomorphic parts and various related factors, especially the groundwater conditions, and fully estimate the changes in soil improvement conditions after reclamation. The relevant disciplines comprehensively classified and graded these factors, with water conservancy and soil improvement as the guiding principle, and divided Xinjiang's land resources into five levels, each of which was further divided into five levels according to different situations. Each level specifically explains the soil properties, the complexity of soil improvement, and improvement measures. The land use coefficient was also proposed for each level of land, the mu of reclaimable land was estimated, and a preliminary zoning of soil improvement was made.

    Kaidu River Diversion and the North-to-South Water Transfer of the Ertix River and Ulungur River

    To rationally develop and utilize Xinjiang's water and soil resources, in addition to studying water regulation and fully utilizing surface water and groundwater sources, it is also possible to consider the issue of inter-regional water transfer to make up for deficiencies with surpluses in some key construction areas in the future. The Xinjiang Comprehensive Survey Team focused on investigating the diversion of the Kaidu River and the north-to-south water transfer of the Ertix River and Ulungur River basins to comprehensively utilize water resources.

    The Kaidu River is located in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in the central section of the Tianshan Mountains, and it and the Kurle area to the southwest will become one of the new bases for industrial and agricultural development in Xinjiang in the future. At present, the water and soil resources are very unbalanced. Bayingolin Prefecture has little land and abundant water, while the Kurle area has abundant land and scarce water. To fundamentally solve this contradiction, it is necessary to carry out the Kaidu River diversion project, so that the Kaidu River does not flow into Bosten Lake, which has an area of 1,000 square kilometers, but flows directly into the Kongque River. This will reduce the huge amount of water evaporation loss (about 1.6 billion cubic meters) from this lake and nearby swamps every year, greatly increasing the flow of the Kongque River downstream, so that it is possible to expand the irrigation area of more than 6 million mu south of Kurle. However, to realize the Kaidu River diversion and comprehensive utilization of water resources, another new contradiction must be solved, that is, the rational allocation and regulation of power generation (total capacity can reach 1 million kilowatts) in the canyon section of the upper reaches of the Kaidu River and irrigation in the lower reaches of the Kongque River in terms of water use time. Such huge power generation and irrigation are of great significance to Xinjiang's national economy, and the planning and design of the entire project is also extremely complex. The local water conservancy department has carried out detailed surveys for several years and has initially proposed several diversion plans, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. On this basis, the survey team conducted comparative research from the aspects of water and soil balance, comprehensive utilization, and economic benefits based on the on-site investigation of the geological and geomorphological and hydrogeological conditions of the basin, and put forward new suggestions on the establishment of anti-regulation reservoirs, the determination of diversion trunk lines, and the combination of temporary and permanent projects, and predicted the new balance of water volume and other natural changes in Bosten Lake after the diversion, providing scientific arguments for future survey and design.

    The Ertix River and Ulungur River basins in Altay are another situation. It is an area that has yet to be developed and has received less investigation and research. Although it also has good natural conditions and abundant water, soil, pasture, forest and mineral resources, and has great potential for development, most of the resources are currently not utilized. For example, the water volume of the Ertix River is second only to the Yili River, but almost all of the 10.1 billion cubic meters of annual runoff flows out of the country. The annual runoff of the Ulungur River is much smaller, only 1.16 billion cubic meters, which is far from enough to develop the farmland and pasture that may be developed for irrigation along the coast, but 80% of the water is evaporated and lost due to flowing into Ulungur Lake. In order to rationally develop the water and soil resources of the two river basins, state-owned farms have been actively expanded in recent years, and it is planned to build a canal to connect the two river systems and bring the water all the way to Xiazijie, 240 kilometers south of the Ulungur River, to develop millions of mu of wasteland. According to the requirements of the local water conservancy and land reclamation departments, the comprehensive survey team conducted a comprehensive survey of agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, transportation, etc., with the development of water and soil resources as the center, and analyzed in detail the natural conditions and production configuration characteristics, engineering measures and economic benefits of the basin, and proposed outline plans for short-term and long-term development. A comprehensive estimate and evaluation was made of water volume, water energy, and land quality, and specific suggestions were also made on the main hydraulic hubs, regulating reservoirs, water diversion canals, channel development, and reclamation area selection. In particular, it was determined that the Baodamay reclamation area and the Shi (Shibadi) Baoda Canal, which have small investments and quick returns, should be the first phase of construction projects, while the originally planned Wuxia Da Canal should be postponed to the later stage of the project, which was adopted by the local government in a timely manner and played a positive role.

    Natural Regionalization and Agricultural Regionalization

    Xinjiang has a vast land area, and its natural and economic conditions are very complex, and the economic formation process of various ethnic groups in history is also inconsistent. It is necessary to carry out natural regionalization and agricultural regionalization work.

    The comprehensive survey team compiled a natural zoning for agricultural production services. This zoning is divided into four levels. Each level focuses on considering natural factors related to agriculture according to certain principles, and briefly reviews the favorable and unfavorable conditions and improvement measures in each level area. For example, the first-level zone is based on the biological climate principle, and the average daily temperature is used. The dividing line between greater than 10°C and annual cumulative temperature of 4000°C divides the temperate desert in northern Xinjiang and the warm temperate desert in southern Xinjiang. The second-level area mainly divides the east-west changes according to aridity and divides it into fifteen regions. The third level is the basic zoning unit. In the plains, the changes in geomorphology, Quaternary sediments, vegetation, especially soil, are used as the leading factors for zoning to connect reclamation conditions. In mountainous areas, the changes in geomorphology combined with slope orientation (mainly reflecting changes in vegetation) are emphasized in connection with forestry and animal husbandry, and it is divided into forty-three large areas. The fourth level is the small area, taking into account the smaller geomorphic units, and at the same time focusing on the factors that have a greater impact on Xinjiang's agriculture and animal husbandry, such as soil salinity and wind.

    Agricultural regionalization was further formulated with reference to natural regionalization. Agricultural regionalization must consider the balance of food supply and demand and the degree of profit and loss in various places, the commodity rate of major agricultural and livestock products, the composition of crops and livestock, the degree of reclamation, the long-term prospects of population growth and the level of food consumption, and the existing technical level of agriculture and animal husbandry in various regions. According to the similarity of natural and economic conditions and the roughly the same agricultural development tasks, without breaking the administrative boundaries of the county, Xinjiang is first divided into two regions, north and south Xinjiang, and then further divided into twenty-eight small areas. Each area explains its scope, characteristics of natural and economic conditions, current agricultural configuration, and proposes the direction of development, the proportion of major crops, and corresponding technical measures. In some areas where the survey is more detailed and the economy is more developed, agricultural specialized small areas and their leading agricultural and animal husbandry sectors are further divided.

    Comprehensive survey is a scientific investigation. In addition to studying major production and construction issues in the region and proposing more comprehensive long-term development suggestions, it also accumulates scientific data and explores scientific issues that need to be explored. The great achievements made by the Xinjiang Comprehensive Survey Team in the surveys north and south of the Tianshan Mountains have greatly enriched the scientific content of China's geography, geology, soil, biology, agronomy and other disciplines. This work may also propose new research topics and promote the growth of new scientific departments, so that the survey task can drive the development of disciplines.

    新疆自然的面貌和综合考察的成就
    新疆维吾尔自治区占有全国六分之一的土地面积，自然资源极为丰富，既具有发展农、林、牧、副、渔的优越条件，也拥有发展工业所必需的矿藏和动力的巨大潜力。就现在已知的资源初步估计，全疆有近亿亩可垦土地，四十多万平方公里可供放牧的四季草场，山坡和大河沿岸的原始森林还蓄积着一亿七千多万立方米的木材。矿产资源方面，像石油、煤、有色金属和稀有金属都具有全国意义。新疆气候干旱，水利资源较少，但全疆天然有效年径流量总计仍有七百五十亿公方，远大于整个黄河流域的径流总量。此外尚有储量极大的高山冰川和地下水源。至于作物所需的热量资源在平原地方也颇为充足。所以从综合开发利用的远景来看，国民经济各部门均有极其广阔的发展前途。当然，新疆自然条件也很复杂。它占有着四十万平方公里的大片沙漠，荒漠戈壁的面积也不小。加以气候异常干燥，寒暑相差极大，全区内低于海平面的吐鲁番洼地出现过全国绝对最高气温（47.8℃），位在阿勒泰的富蕴又是全国绝对最低气温的“寒极”（－50.8℃）。此外蒸发渗漏强烈，风沙频繁，土壤严重盐渍化等，这些不利条件在生产发展上起着很大的不良影响。可以说，新疆在我们社会主义的时代里，既是开发建设大有可为的地方，同时也是改造自然工程的重大对象。
    新疆综合考察就是为了要确切查明新疆独特的自然条件的分布规律，研究充分利用各种自然资源和合理的生产力配置，特别偏重农、林、牧、水利建设方面，提供编制远景国民经济发展计划的科学依据，作出相应的轮廓性的建设方案。
    四年以来，考察队北自阿尔泰山，南迄昆仑山麓，每年按不同地区和重点研究的问题，分别以包括有关各专业的综合组织形式，对全疆作了广泛的路线考察和典型调查。对于重大的研究项目，如盐渍土改良，还配合国营农场进行了定位试验研究。虽然目前考察工作尚未结束，但通过这样广泛而全面的实地考察，从不同学科多方面地加以综合分析研究，不仅对缺少研究的地区积累了大量科学资料，并初步探明了新疆干旱地区的特殊自然条件的性质和分布规律，特别对发展生产密切有关的水土资源作了新的估算和评价，对土壤积盐过程和它复杂的改良条件进行了较深入的研究。对未来若干重点建设地区的径流调节、河流改道与合理开发水土资源还进行了综合调查。对发展畜牧业的天然饲料基地和农牧结合等方面也作了实地考察和评价。在这些重点问题的研究基础上，结合了考察队对全疆各地区自然条件和农业生产配置现状的分析，进一步作了自然区划和农业区划的初步研究，对自治区内不同地区农业发展方向和主要技术措施提出了建议，为今后进行全面科学总结与建设性的方案奠定了基础。新疆水、土资源的估算和
    评价
    新疆位于极端干燥的内陆盆地，降水极少，不仅全疆98％的耕地须全赖灌溉，就是发展畜牧业，建立城市和工矿企业，兴筑交通道路时，供水也常常成一个关键性问题。因此分析自治区内各地径流的形成、水文地质条件以及水量的正确估算与评价，就具有十分重要的意义。
    由于新疆可垦荒地面积较大，总的来说，地表径流还不很够用，再加水土资源在地区分布上又很不平衡，例如开都河流域的焉耆盆地水量占全疆总水量5.9％，而落实可垦的土地只占全疆总数的1.7％；反之，玛纳斯河地区的水占全疆总水量4.8％，而落实可垦土地却占全疆总数11％强。至于水量的年际变化和年径流变差系数，因河流水量大部分依靠高山冰川和季节雪的融化为主要补给来源，所以比我国东部河流为小而较有保证。但是冬季雪量大小，春播前后的气温高低和稳定程度，都对来水量影响很大，而春旱又是相当普遍的现象。夏季洪水，特别是南疆，来势猛骤，又须防洪拦蓄，加以引用。同时由于山麓地带广泛分布着粗颗粒的洪水冲积物质，渗漏很严重，往往引水渠道通过这些砾石戈壁，每公里会损失水量高达2％—3％。地表径流的大量渗漏散失，又使得地下水的动力储量极为丰富。考察队通过水文地理的河道勘查，地质地貌结构的考察，水文地质的重点钻探和水质分析，了解了各地径流形成过程，地表水与地下水转换关系，潜水动态与矿化度类型的一些分布规律。同时根据水分资料的全面分析，利用流量与气温相关及其他方法延长插补了主要河流的流量，使达到工程设计的要求，并计算出全疆和各地区的径流总量。如果把全疆径流总量的大部分控制利用起来，就可以把现有耕地面积扩大两倍以上。对于地下水资源，经过考察和利用若干水文测验的资料也作了粗略的估计，全疆不包括阿勒泰、伊犁和塔城地区就有一百六十三亿公方动力储量，约占全疆地表径流总量三分之一。这是一个尚未开发利用的巨大财富。同时还确定准噶尔盆地、吐鲁番洼地和喀什三角洲是自流水盆地，利用条件更好，未来许多城市和工业用水也都可以依靠地下水来解决。
    土地资源的正确估计和评价，对于合理开垦是另一个重大问题。新疆可垦荒地面积大，是全国大面积开荒造田重点地区之一。但由于这些土地分布于内陆的闭塞和半塞闭盆地里，长期处在干燥的环境中进行着它独特的地球化学和反复的积盐过程，不仅土壤普遍存在着盐渍化，还具有硫酸盐、氯化钠、硝酸盐、苏打等不同的复杂类型，而且含盐量之高也是世界上少有的。而盐份较轻，地下水位低，排水条件较好的冲积扇和三角洲的上部和中部往往都早被当地农民开垦拓殖，现在新辟农地的对象，不得不面向着积盐较重的冲积扇缘和冲积平原的下部地方。解放以来，特别是新疆的军垦部队，从异常艰苦的自然环境中，大规模进行垦殖，建立了成百的农场，为国家增产棉粮取得了很大成绩。他们在改造自然的生产实践过程中，遭遇了许多困难，特别是对次生盐渍化的斗争。有少数农场不仅受严重碱害，作物产量逐年下降，造成亏损，而且不得不被迫放弃成片的已垦耕地。因此对土地资源的正确评价成为当务之急。如利用不合理，不只是阻碍进一步农业生产的发展，还会使土地资源遭受破坏。考察队因此把盐渍土改良作为一个重大的中心问题，进行了全面的土地资源的评级工作。根据新疆平原地区土壤形成过程的复杂性，不能单纯只考虑目前土壤本身的性状和垦区地形平坦与否等少数条件，而应着重分析不同地貌部位的土壤改良难易程度以及相关的各种因素，特别是地下水状况，充分估计到开垦后土壤改良条件的变化。综合了有关各专业对这些因素的分区分级评定，而以水利土壤改良为纲，将新疆土地资源分为五级，每一级又根据不同情况再分为五级。每一级都具体说明了土壤性状、土壤改良的复杂程度和改良措施。还对各级土地提出了土地利用系数，估算了落实可垦的地亩，并作出土壤改良初步区划。
　　开都河改道与额尔济斯河、乌伦古河的北水南调
    要合理开发利用新疆水土资源，除研究水量调节，充分利用地表水与地下水源外，在有些未来重点建设地区还有可能考虑以余济缺的地区间的调水问题。新疆综合考察队对开都河的改道和额尔济斯河与乌伦古河流域的北水南调，综合利用水利资源，作了重点考察。
    开都河位于天山中段的巴音郭楞自治州，它与西南相邻的库尔勒地区将成为新疆未来工、农业发展新基地之一，目前水土资源很不平衡。巴音郭楞州地少水多，库尔勒地区则地多水缺。要从根本上解决这个矛盾，必须进行开都河改道工程，使开都河不注入一千平方公里面积的博斯腾湖，而直接注入孔雀河。这样减少了这个湖面和附近沼泽每年巨大水量的蒸发损耗（约十六亿公方），大大增加孔雀河下游的流量，以便有可能扩大库尔勒以南六百万亩以上的灌溉面积。但是要实现开都河改道和综合利用水利资源又须解决另一个新的矛盾，即开都河上游峡谷地段的发电（总容量可达一百万瓩）和孔雀河下游灌溉在用水时间上的合理分配与调节。这样巨大的发电与灌溉在新疆国民经济上都有很大意义，整个工程的规划设计也异常复杂。地方水利部门已作了数年的详细勘查，并初拟了几个各有利弊的改道方案。考察队在这基础上，根据该流域地质地貌和水文地质条件的实地勘察，从水土平衡、综合利用和经济效益等方面进行比较研究，对建立反调节水库，确定改道干线，临时工程与永久工程结合等方面提出新的建议，并预测了改道后博斯腾湖水量新的平衡与其他自然变化，为今后勘察设计提供了科学论证。
    阿尔泰的额尔济斯河与乌伦古河流域又是另一种情况。那里是一个待开发而调查研究较少的地区。尽管同样具有良好的自然条件和丰富的水、土、草场、森林和矿产资源，极有开发前途，目前却大部分资源均未利用。如额尔济斯河的水量仅次于伊犁河，而几乎全部一百零一亿公方的年径流量流出到国境以外。乌伦古河的年径流量要小得多，只有十一点六亿公方，远远不够发展沿岸可能开发灌溉的农田和草场的需要，但十分之八的水量也由于注入乌伦古湖而被蒸发损失了。为了合理开发两河流域的水土资源，近年已在积极扩建国营农场，并计划修筑运河沟通两河水系，把水一直引到乌伦古河以南二百四十公里的夏子街，开拓数百万亩荒地。综合考察队根据地方水利与农垦部门的要求，以水土资源开发为中心，对农、牧、工业、交通运输等进行了全面考察，详细分析了流域的自然条件和生产配置的特征，工程措施与经济效益，提出了近期和远期开发的轮廓方案。对水量、水能、土地质量都作了全面的估算评价，对主要水力枢纽、调节水库、引水干渠、航道开拓、垦区选择等方面也提出了具体建议。特别是确定了投资小、收益快的包达玛依垦区和什（什巴堤）包大渠为第一期兴建工程，而把原拟动工的乌夏大渠推迟为后期工程，及时被地方政府采纳，起了积极作用。
    自然区划与农业区划
    新疆土地面积既很广，自然与经济条件又十分复杂，而各民族历史上经济形成过程也不一致，有必要进行自然区划与农业区划工作。
    综合考察队编制了为农业生产服务的自然区划。这个区划共分四级，每一级都根据一定原则，着重考虑与农业有关的自然因素，并对每一级区内的有利和不利的条件及改良措施作扼要的评述。如第一级的地带是根据生物气候原则，采用了平均每日气温，大于10℃和年积温4000℃的界线，划分北疆温带荒漠和南疆暖温带荒漠。第二级区主要根据干燥度分划东西方向的变化差别，分成十五个地区。第三级是基本的区划单位，在平原主要以地貌、第四纪沉积物、植被，特别是土壤的变化作为分划的主导因素，以联系农垦条件；而山地则根据地貌结合坡向变化（主要反映植被的变化），偏重联系到林牧业，共分为四十三个大区。第四级是小区，考虑到较小的地貌单位，同时着重对新疆农牧业影响较大的因素如土壤盐分和风等。
    农业区划是进一步参考了自然区划拟定的。农业区划必须考虑各地粮食供需平衡与盈亏程度，主要农畜产品商品率，作物及牲畜构成，开垦程度，人口增长远景与粮食消费水平，各地区农牧业现有技术水平等。按照自然和经济条件相类似，农业发展任务大体相同，以不打破县的行政界线，首先把新疆划分为南北疆两个地区，再进一步分为二十八个小区。每个区都说明了它的范围，自然与经济条件的特征，农业配置现状，并提出了发展方向和主要作物的比重以及相应的技术措施。在某些调查较详经济较发达的区内，还进一步划分了农业专门化小区及其主导的农牧业部门。
    综合考察是一种科学考察，它除研究地区重大的生产建设问题，提出比较全面的远景开发建议外，同时也积累科学资料，发掘有待探索的科学问题。新疆综合考察队在天山南北考察所取得的巨大成绩，大大丰富了我国地理、地质、土壤、生物、农学等学科的科学内容。这一工作还有可能提出新的研究课题，促进新的科学部门的成长，使考察任务带动学科发展。
