    Luo Shengbing, Who Carefully Raises Pigs
    Gansu Daily Reporter

    On December 1, the People's Daily introduced the feeding and management experience of the pig farm in the Zhonglianchuan Production Team of the Gongjing Commune in Yuzhong County, Gansu. However, the creative labor of the feeders there, especially Comrade Luo Shengbing, is even more worthy of introduction to readers. Look at those clumsy pigs, living such a regular life under their management, it is truly admirable!
    Let's start from the beginning.
    Every morning, as soon as it was light, Luo Shengbing and other feeders entered the pigsty in the Zhonglianchuan pig farm. They raised their voices, awakening the sleeping pigs in the cave dwellings and under the sheds with a series of "lao lao..." shouts. They all got up, walked out of the pigsty, and ran to the manure pit in the middle of the yard to defecate and urinate. Soon, following the shouts of Luo Shengbing and the others, the pigs walked out of the pen door and along the rugged mountain road towards the outside of the village. In the fresh air, greedy sows foraged for wild grass, and playful piglets hopped back and forth. Half an hour later, the pigs were driven back to the pig farm. Around ten o'clock, the feeders prepared the feed, and the pigs went to the trough to eat in order. After eating the fixed amount, the feeders tapped the edge of the trough a few times with the mallet used to mix the feed, and the pigs turned around and walked towards the sunny courtyard. There, they either chased and played with each other, or lay in the corners basking in the sun. When night fell, they returned to the pigsty in groups after hearing the shouts. In milder weather, they slept in a scattered manner or huddled together; in the hot summer, the feeders instructed them to sleep separately; when the cold winter arrived, the feeders taught them to squeeze together and sleep upside down in order to keep each other warm.
    Everyone who has visited the Zhonglianchuan pig farm believes that this is a miracle and praises the feeders Luo Shengbing and other feeders for their love of their work, their ingenuity in the pig-raising business, and their creation of a complete set of feeding management methods.
    Zhonglianchuan is located in the mountains, with inconvenient transportation and difficult shipping. Most of the pigs raised in the farm are Zhonglianchuan pigs. These pigs have large skeletons and gain weight quickly, but their disadvantage is that their hooves and legs are weak, they cannot walk long distances, and they easily lose weight when transferred. Luo Shengbing, an expert in pig raising, was very troubled by this. He thought: How much feed is spent, and the pigs are fattened with hard work. If they lose weight or even get sick after a long journey, it would be a loss to the country, the commune, and the people! One day, he suddenly remembered: a person with a weak body will become stronger after long-term morning exercises. As the saying goes: Humans and animals are the same. If the pigs were exercised in the morning, it might be better in the long journey. He told his partners about these ideas, and everyone agreed to give it a try. In this way, the pigs' "morning exercises" began. One day passed, one month passed... Sure enough, pigs that had been exercised for a longer period of time overcame the weakness of their hooves and legs and no longer lost weight during transportation.
    The success of the initial attempt and the encouragement of the Party gave Luo Shengbing even greater strength. He became more diligent in his work, and his heart was completely devoted to the pigs. One snowy night, Luo Shengbing suddenly heard the pigs moaning in the pen from the cold. He couldn't sleep at all. How could he keep the pigs warmer? Suddenly, he remembered his bitter life of driving carts for landlords before liberation: at that time, he had no bedding and couldn't sleep at night because of the cold. In order not to freeze his feet, he and his partners often huddled together upside down to keep each other warm. He thought, what if the pigs could also sleep together upside down? As soon as he thought of this, he turned over, got dressed, and ran into the pigsty in the wind and snow, one by one gathering the pigs together, and letting them squeeze together and sleep upside down. However, the disobedient pigs bit and screamed at each other after sleeping for a while. This was indeed very annoying. Should he ignore it? The pigs would freeze; should he manage it? The pigs wouldn't listen. Luo Shengbing thought over and over again, asking himself, "Will such a small difficulty scare people? No, the pigs must be trained well." So, he cheered up again, patiently coaxing and appeasing them, taking care of this group and then taking care of that group, until the pigs were all sleeping quietly before he went back to rest. In this way, after seven or eight nights of training, the pigs slowly got used to it, and they automatically slept together upside down in order at night. From then on, the pigs no longer moaned even in colder weather.
    The pig farm developed, and there were more and more piglets. Luo Shengbing also trained sows with many piglets and sows with few piglets to lie down in circles, and enclosed the piglets in the middle, adjusting the nursing among themselves. At first, the sows would bite and gnaw randomly when they saw other piglets running to suckle, but after three or five days, they slowly became familiar with each other. The sows not only stopped biting and gnawing randomly, but also automatically lay down in circles, allowing the piglets to crouch freely in the circle to suckle.
    Once, they found that some pigs grew fast, while others grew very slowly. What was the reason? After careful observation, they found that they put all kinds of pigs together in the same pen. When eating, they fought for food, some ate more, some didn't eat enough; in the pen, the strong bullied the weak, and the big suppressed the small. Based on this phenomenon, they grouped the pigs according to their size, fatness, thinness, fast eating, and slow eating, and fed them in separate troughs. In this way, the pigs grew faster, and management was also very convenient.
    When there are many pigs, the most feared thing is the occurrence of infectious diseases. Luo Shengbing thought: Why do pigs get infectious diseases? It is nothing more than poor feeding, too hot or too cold weather; or external infections and insufficient attention to hygiene. Therefore, he concluded that to eliminate infectious diseases, one must start from two aspects: on the one hand, establish a series of systems internally, including five determinations (person, place, time, feed amount, position), four cleans (water, feed, trough, animal body), six no-feeds (too hot, too cold, too late, too early, too thin, too dry), and "one cleaning a day, one disinfection every seven days, one injection every six months, and changing the litter soil every month"; on the other hand, adhere to the "self-breeding and self-raising" of excellent varieties, and subject new pig breeds introduced from the outside to strict quarantine procedures. In this way, for three years, the pigs they raised were fat and healthy, and none died from illness.
    Luo Shengbing's experience in raising pigs has received great attention from the Party. The Party not only summarized his feeding methods and established him as a model, but also promoted his pig-raising experience through various means; it also sent him to various places to study and preach, and to demonstrate on the spot. Now his pig-raising experience has not only "bloomed inside the wall and filled the garden with red" in Gongjing Commune, but has also yielded fruitful results in many places throughout the county.

    精心养猪的罗生炳
    甘肃日报记者
    12月1日，人民日报介绍了甘肃榆中县贡井公社中连川生产队养猪场的饲养管理经验。但是，那里的饲养员，特别是罗生炳同志的创造性劳动，更值得向读者介绍。你看那些笨头笨脑的猪，在他们的管教下，生活得那样有规律，真是使人赞叹！
    我们还是从头说起吧。
    每天早晨，天刚麻亮，在中连川养猪场里，罗生炳和其他一些饲养员走进猪圈，他们扬起嗓子，在一片“唠唠……”的?喝声中，唤醒了熟睡在窑洞里和圈棚下的猪群。它们一个个爬了起来，走出猪圈，跑到院落中间的积肥坑里拉屎拉尿。不久，猪群又顺着罗生炳他们的?喝声，走出圈门，沿着崎岖的山路，向村外走去。在清新的空气里，贪食的母猪寻吃野草，调皮的猪仔蹦前蹦后。半小时后，猪群赶回猪场。十时左右，饲养员们准备好了饲料，猪群按次序到槽旁去吃食。当吃完定量的食以后，饲养员用搅拌饲料的榔头敲几下槽边，猪群就回过头走向阳光充足的场院。在那里，或者互相追逐嬉戏，或者躺在角落里晒太阳。当夜幕降临，听到?喝声才一群一群回到猪圈。在气候比较温和时，它们打花睡或者靠在一起睡；在炎热的夏天，饲养员关照它们分散睡；当严冬到来的时候，饲养员又教会它们挤在一起，颠倒着睡，以便互相取暖。
    凡是参观过中连川养猪场的人们，都认为这是奇迹，都对饲养员罗生炳以及其他的饲养员那种热爱自己的工作，在养猪事业中绞尽了脑汁，创造出了一整套饲养管理方法表示赞扬。
  中连川在万山丛中，交通不便，运输困难。场里所养的大部分是中连川猪。这种猪骨架大，长膘快，缺点是蹄腿软，走不得长路，外调容易掉膘。养猪能手罗生炳很为这事苦恼。他想：花了多少饲料，辛辛苦苦养肥的猪，要是经过长途跋涉而掉膘甚至生病，这对国家、公社和人民都是一种损失啊！有一天，他忽然想起来：一个身体弱的人，经过长期的早操锻炼，身体就会健壮。常言说：人畜一理，要是让猪群早上也锻炼锻炼，在长途跋涉中说不定会好些。他把这些想法讲给了伙伴们听，大家都同意试一试。就这样，猪群的“早操”开始了。一天过去了，一月过去了……果然，经过较长期锻炼的猪，就克服了蹄腿软的缺点，在调运中不再发生掉膘现象。
    初次尝试的成功和党的鼓励，给了罗生炳更大的力量。他对工作更加勤劳了，他的心呀，全贴在了猪身上。是一个风雪交加的夜晚，罗生炳忽然听见猪在圈里冻得呻吟。他怎么也睡不着觉，如何让猪暖和一些呢？忽然，他想起了自己解放前给地主赶车的苦难生活：那时候，他没铺没盖，晚上冻的睡不着觉，为了不把脚冻坏，他和伙伴们经常颠倒偎依在一起，彼此互相取暖。他想，要是让猪儿也能颠倒睡在一起，那该多好。一想到这里，他翻身起来，穿好衣服，就冒着风雪跑进猪圈，把猪一个一个的?在一起，让它们挤着颠倒睡下。可是，不听话的猪，睡下不久，相互乱咬乱叫。这确是很恼火的事。不管吗？猪儿会冻坏的；管吗？猪又不听话。罗生炳想来想去，自己问自己说：“这么一点困难，就吓倒人吗？不行，一定要把猪儿训练好。”于是，他又打起精神，耐心地?这喝那，安顿好这群，又照顾那群，一直等到猪都睡安静了，他才回去休息。就这样，经过七、八个夜晚的训练，猪儿慢慢习惯了，它们晚间自动按次序颠倒睡在一起。从此，再冷的天气，猪儿也不再呻吟了。
    猪场发展了，小猪越来越多了。罗生炳又训练产仔多的母猪和产仔少的母猪围成圆圈躺下，把小猪圈在中间，互相调剂着吮奶。开头，母猪看见别的小猪跑来吮奶就乱啃乱咬，但是经过三天、五天，慢慢也就混熟了，母猪不但不再乱咬乱啃了，而且自动围成圆圈躺下，让小猪蹴在圆圈中自由吮奶。
    有一次，他们发现有的猪长得快，有的长得很慢。这是什么原因呢？经过仔细的观察，原来他们把各种猪圈在一起，吃食时你争我夺，有的吃得多，有的吃不饱；在圈里也是强欺弱，大压小。根据这种现象，他们把猪按大、小、肥、瘦、吃食快、吃食慢等不同情况分别编组，分槽喂养，这样，猪长得又快，管理也非常方便。
    猪多了，最怕的是发生传染病。罗生炳想：为什么猪会发生传染病呢？不外是由于饲养不善，天气太热太冷；或是外界的传染和卫生注意的不够。因此，他得出结论，要消灭传染病，必须从两方面下手：一方面是在内部建立了五定（人、地方、时间、食量、位置）、四净（水、料、槽、畜体）、六不喂（太热、太冷、太迟、太早、太稀、太干）和“一天一扫除，七天一消毒，半年一注射，每月换窝土”的一系列制度；另方面坚持优良品种的“自繁自养”，对外面引进的新猪种，要经过严格的检疫手续。这样，三年来，他们饲养的生猪，膘肥体健，没有一口因病死亡。
    罗生炳饲养生猪的经验，受到了党的极大重视。党不仅总结了他的饲养方法，树他为标兵，并且通过各种方式推广了他的养猪经验；还派他到各地去游学说法，当场示范。现在他的养猪经验，不仅在贡井公社“墙内开花满园红”，而且在全县不少地方也结出了丰硕的果实。
