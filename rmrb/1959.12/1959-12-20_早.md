    "Early"
    Cao Baoming
    In Wuhan Iron and Steel (WuGang), building a world-class blast furnace in one hundred and forty days and a "King of Open Hearth Furnaces" in thirty days has changed the way we measure the construction of such giant projects from "years" to "months" and "days." In Xiangyang Prefecture, during just over a month of autumn plowing, Yun County transformed five thousand eight hundred mountains into six hundred and eighty thousand mu of terraced fields, and Zaoyang connected more than one million three hundred thousand mu of small plots into large fields, bringing about a radical change to the millennia-old landscape. Faced with these heroic achievements, no one can help but applaud and cheer!
    Where does the speed come from? Where does the excellence come from? The common answer is: Launch a large-scale mass movement! "Wherever the Party points, the masses will attack!" However, this answer is not enough; there is another important word: "Early." The construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Blast Furnace only began in late February this year, but they started preparing in the third quarter of last year. The autumn plowing in Xiangyang Prefecture only started at the end of August, but they started preparing from April this year.
    As the old saying goes, "Before the troops move, supplies must go first." If there is no early preparation, when the army moves, the people will be without food and the horses without fodder. If it is not handled well, it will lead to "insufficient supplies, and retreat without a fight." If the masses are mobilized, but there is no equipment or materials, it will affect the enthusiasm of the masses and cause losses to the work. Of course, a large army can also accelerate the completion of material, technical, and organizational preparations. Within the word "Early," the most important thing is ideological preparation.
    People's actions are governed by thought. When understanding is clear, enthusiasm is high, drive is great, and there are more solutions. This is the principle of "putting politics in command and letting ideology lead." Rather than seeing "wherever the Party points, the masses will attack" as the cause of the mass movement, it is better to see it as the result of the Party's insistence on ideological mobilization.
    Ideological deliberation needs to be early because a person's understanding of things always develops from low to high, from shallow to deep, and from one-sided to complete. A true understanding of the task also requires a development process. Some people understand quickly, and some people understand slowly. But to make the masses understand clearly and form a movement, a considerable period of deliberation is needed. In particular, when leaders gather the scattered opinions of the masses, they always concentrate on the advanced thinking among the masses. To transform the advanced thinking of the masses into the actions of the entire masses, and to transform the "spontaneous" demands of the masses into "conscious" actions, an even longer deliberation process is needed. Early deliberation and early preparation can enable leaders and the masses to undergo several repetitions in understanding, further recognizing the essence of things, grasping the common urgent demands of the masses and the main links in the work, and achieving "grasping one link to drive the overall situation."
    Regarding this word "Early," the ancients had some understanding. "It is better to mend the roof before it rains than to dig a well when thirsty" is one example. However, fully grasping the laws of development of things, making advance arrangements based on scientific foresight, and especially fully recognizing the subjective initiative of people and mobilizing people's thoughts early and fully, can only be done by Marxists.
    Grasping this word "Early," and fully utilizing this leadership method of early deliberation and early preparation, considering the next movement while in the midst of the current movement, considering the next season while in the midst of the current season, and considering the next year while in the midst of the current year, can enable the next movement to follow closely after the end of the previous movement, so that large-scale mass movements surge one wave after another, developing continuously. This will also promote the continuous high-speed development of our construction cause, and enable us to build our socialism sooner!

    “早”
    曹葆铭
    在武钢，一百四十天建成一座世界第一流的大高炉和三十天建成一座“平炉之王”，使我们建设这样的巨型工程的时间由以“年”为计算单位变为以“月”“日”为计算单位。在襄阳专区，也只是在一个多月的秋耕当中，郧县便将五千八百架山改造成六十八万亩梯田梯地，枣阳便将一百三十多万亩小块土地连成了大片，使千年山河大变样。在这些英雄业迹面前，无论是谁，都不能不拍手叫快叫好！
    快从何来？好从何来？共同的回答是：大搞群众运动！“党指向哪里，群众就攻到哪里！”但是，这样的回答还不够，还有一个重要的字：“早”。武钢二号高炉今年2月中旬末才动工，但他们去年三季度就开始准备。襄阳专区的秋耕8月底才开始，他们从今年4月起就开始准备了。
    老话说：“兵马未动，粮草先行。”如果没有早早准备，大军行动起来，人无粮，马无料，弄得不好，就会“粮秣不济，不战自退”。群众发动起来了，要设备没设备，要材料没材料，也就会使群众热情受到影响，工作造成损失。当然，千军万马反过来也能使物资的、技术的、组织的准备加速完成。在“早”字里面，更重要的是思想准备。
    人的行动是受思想支配的。认识明确了热情就高，干劲就大，办法也就更多。这也就是“政治挂帅，思想先行”的道理。与其把“党指向哪里，群众就攻到哪里”看做是群众运动的原因，还不如把它看做是党坚持思想发动的结果。
    思想酝酿所以要早，还因为一个人对事物的认识总是由低到高，由浅到深，由片面到完整，有一个发展过程。对任务的真正理解也就需要一个发展过程。有的人理解得快，有的人理解得慢。但要使群众都认识清楚，形成一个运动，就要有相当长的酝酿时间。特别是领导将群众的分散的意见集中起来，总是集中群众中的先进思想，要把群众中的先进思想变为全体群众的行动，要把群众的“自在”要求变为“自觉”的行动，就更得有相当长的酝酿过程。早酝酿，早准备，就能使领导和群众在认识上经过几次反复，进一步认清事物的本质，抓住群众共同的迫切要求和工作中的主要环节，做到“抓住一环带动全面”。
    关于这个“早”字，古人已有所认识，“宜未雨而绸缪，毋临渴而掘井”，就是一例。不过，像这样充分掌握事物发展的规律，能根据科学的预见作出预先的安排，特别是充分认识人的主观能动作用，及早充分地把人的思想发动起来的事，还是只有马克思主义者才能作到。
    抓紧这个“早”字，充分运用这种早酝酿、早准备的领导方法，在上一个运动就考虑下一个运动，在上季就考虑下季，在头年就考虑次年，便能使上一个运动刚结束，下一个运动就紧跟上来，使大规模的群众运动一浪推一浪，持续发展，也就能促使我们的建设事业不断地高速度发展，使我们的社会主义提早建成！
