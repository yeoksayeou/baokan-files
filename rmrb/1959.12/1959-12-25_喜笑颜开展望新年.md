Joyful Smiles Welcome the New Year
Li Shunda, National Model Agricultural Laborer and Director of the Xigou People's Commune, Pingshun County, Shanxi

We bid farewell to the victorious 1959 with joy and welcome the year 1960 with great happiness. In these pleasant days, people always like to look back on the past and look forward to the future. What achievements have we made in the past year? In the past year, our Xigou People's Commune, like many brother people's communes across the country, held high the red flags of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and worked diligently on mountain construction. Our place is advancing by leaps and bounds, just as people say. Previously, people said that our place was "look down, it is a river beach; look up, it is a high mountain." But now it has changed. First of all, in terms of grain, Pingshun has always been a drought-prone area. Last year, it suffered a major drought of seventy days without rain, three hailstorms, two windstorms, and three insect infestations. If these disasters were placed on a small-scale peasant economy, let alone an advanced cooperative, they would be unbearable. However, because we have the People's Commune, with more people and greater strength, our backs are straighter. Last year, our commune mobilized more than 3,000 people and fought for five months, building two large reservoirs and many flood control projects; during the drought, we carried water to irrigate the land, not only overcoming the disasters but also achieving a bumper harvest. This year, our average grain yield was 414 catties per mu, realizing the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. The commune members are all beaming with joy, giving thumbs up and saying, "The People's Commune is great, not only defeating the river god (referring to the large-scale water conservancy projects), but also defeating the god of heaven." Of course, our achievements are not limited to increased grain production. Forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations have all achieved bumper harvests, which we call "vigorously grasping the six treasures." Last year, the entire commune planted 1.38 million walnut trees, which is 1.7 times the total number of walnut trees planted here in history. This year, the commune also renovated 600 mu of land in the 20-mile-long river beach and planted all of them with apple trees; together with the fruit trees planted on the mountains, we now have about 1,000 mu of orchards. In terms of animal husbandry, not only has the quantity increased several times, but also many excellent breeds such as Jinnan yellow cattle, Dutch dairy cows, Swiss dairy goats, and Soviet white pigs have been introduced. In the past, landlords exaggerated that "upon entering the house, one could only hear the chaotic cries of geese and ducks, and it would take half a day to count the donkeys, horses, cattle, and sheep." Now the People's Commune is truly like that!

The biggest change is the great development of industries run by the commune. Our commune has established ten units, including starch factories, agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants, fertilizer plants, and mining plants. Not to mention anything else, just taking the three mining plants run by the commune as an example, more than 300 people labor every day, and the income from mining and transporting one ton of iron ore is more than seven yuan.

What is most encouraging is that three small power plants have been built in the entire commune. At night, the electric lights are shining brightly, and the commune members are indescribably happy. For a long time, people have been looking forward to the wish of "no need for cattle to plow the land, no need for oil to light the lamps," which has begun to be gradually realized. The members of the Xigou Commune, seeing one orchard after another, one factory after another, one road after another, and one herd of cattle and sheep after another, are truly happier and more energetic as they work. Here is just one example: Comrade Shen Jilan led ten women, including Ma Shiguo, to launch the "Ten Fruits Catching Dongguo" (Qinxian pacesetter Wang Dongguo) competition movement. In 1959, each person averaged 675 workdays, creating a value of 1,100 yuan. Of course, this is just one thing among many examples. Facts have proved that it is unfounded for some right-leaning opportunists to say that "the people's commune has deteriorated and the Great Leap Forward has leaped backward."

The brilliant achievements of 1959 encourage the victorious confidence of every commune member, who is determined to greet the new year - 1960 - with more achievements. The commune strives to achieve a grain yield of 500 catties per mu in 1960. The average income per person this year will increase to 150 yuan. In order to completely change the face of the mountainous area, we have seized animal husbandry, with pig raising as the center, to achieve one pig per mu and ten sheep per person. We will also vigorously develop commune-run industries and other enterprises.

Currently, we are working with all the people's communes in the county to build the huge Manhe Reservoir to better serve the people with the Zhanghe River. A large-scale hydroelectric power station will also be built here. With water and electricity, there will be power; with power, heavy physical labor can be replaced, and the face of the mountainous area will be completely renewed. Now it can be said that "Pingshun County has a power station, come and see in a few years, there is rice to eat, there are noodles to eat, and there is no end to eating pork, lamb, and beef, and all kinds of fruits are available." The mountainous area of Pingshun will become more prosperous. Let us hold high the red flags of the General Line, the People's Commune, and the Great Leap Forward, and leap forward, and leap forward again under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

　　喜笑颜开展望新年
    全国农业劳动模范山西平顺县西沟人民公社主任  李顺达
    我们欢欢乐乐送别胜利的1959年，高高兴兴地迎接1960年。在这些愉快的日子，人们总愿意回顾一下过去，再看看将来。过去的一年，我们到底取得了什么成绩呢？一年来，我们西沟人民公社，也和全国许许多多兄弟人民公社一样，高举着党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，辛勤地进行着山区建设。我们这个地方，就像人们所说的，一日千里地前进着。先前，人们说我们这里是“低头看，是河滩；抬头看，是高山。”可是，如今已经变了样。先说粮食，平顺本来就是个干旱地区，去年，又遭受了七十天无雨的大旱灾，三次雹灾，两次风灾，三次虫害。如果把这些灾害，不说是搁在小农经济身上，就是高级社也抵挡不住。可是，我们因为有了人民公社，人多力量大，腰杆子硬了。去年我们公社调了三千多人，大战五个月，修了两个大水库和许许多多防洪工程；天旱的时候，就担水浇地，不但战胜了灾害，而且获得了丰收。今年，我们的粮食平均产量每亩四百一十四斤，提前八年实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的指标。社员们个个喜笑颜开，伸着大姆指说：“人民公社就是行，不仅打败了河神爷（指大搞水利），还战胜了老天爷”。当然，我们的成绩并不只是粮食增了产。林业、牧畜业、副业样样都获得了大丰收，我们叫这是“大抓六宝”。全公社去年只栽核桃树一项，就是一百三十八万株，这个数字相当于我们这里有史以来所栽的核桃树总数的一点七倍。今年，公社又在二十多里长的河滩里，整修了六百亩土地，全部种上了苹果树；加上山上栽的果树，我们现在已有一千亩左右的果园了。在畜牧业方面，不仅在数量上成倍地增长了，而且有了晋南大黄牛、荷兰奶牛、瑞士奶羊、苏联大白猪等许多优良品种。过去地主夸张自己是“进门来只听得鹅鸭乱叫，多半天数不清驴马牛羊”。现在人民公社才真正是这样呢！
    一个最大的变化是公社办的工业大大发展了。我们公社办起来了淀粉厂、农具修配厂、化肥厂、采矿厂等十个单位。不说别的，就以公社办的三个采矿厂来说，每天有三百多人劳动，连采带运，采一吨铁矿就要收入七元多。
    最鼓舞人心的还有，全公社已经兴建了三座小型发电厂。夜晚，电灯照得明晃晃的，社员们心里有说不尽的高兴。长久以来，人们一直在盼望着：“犁地不用牛、点灯不用油”的愿望已经开始在逐步实现了。西沟公社的社员们，看到了一片一片的果木园、一座一座的工厂、一条一条的马路、一圈一圈的牛羊，真是越瞧越高兴，越干越有劲。这里只举一个例子，申纪兰同志领导马是果等十个妇女，开展了“十果赶东果”（沁县标兵王东果）竞赛运动，1959年每人平均做劳动日六百七十五个，创造价值一千一百元。当然，这只是许多事例当中的一件事情。事实证明，有些右倾机会主义分子说“人民公社化坏了，大跃进跃退了”，是毫无根据的。
    1959年的光辉成绩，鼓舞着每个社员的胜利信心，决心要以更多的成就迎接新的一年——1960年。全公社1960年的粮食亩产量力争达到五百斤。今年每人平均收入将要增加到一百五十元。为了彻底改变山区的面貌，我们抓住了以养猪为中心的畜牧业，做到一亩地一头猪，每人十头羊。并要大办公社工业和其它企业。
    目前，我们和全县各人民公社一起，正在修建巨大的满河水库，让漳河更好的为人们服务。在这里，还要修建一座大型水力发电站。有了水，有了电，就有了动力；有了动力，就可以代替笨重的体力劳动，就会使山区面貌变得焕然一新。现在完全可以这样说：“平顺县有了发电站，再过几年你来看，吃米有米，吃面有面，猪羊牛肉吃不完，各种水果样样全”。平顺山区就会更加富裕起来。让我们高举总路线、人民公社、大跃进的红旗，在党和毛主席领导下，跃进，再跃进。（附图片）
