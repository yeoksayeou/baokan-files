Xinhua News Agency Report: In 1959, China's civil aviation conducted a variety of aerial operations in more than 100 counties across 17 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, powerfully supporting the development of agricultural and forestry production. From the skies over the forest sea of ​​the Greater Khingan Mountains, the wheat-waving plains of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, and the cotton-field fertile land on both banks of the Jinghui Canal in Guanzhong; all the way to the desert areas of the Northwest and the barren mountains and ridges of the Liangshan area in Sichuan, civil aircraft have achieved good results in eliminating crop and forest pests and diseases, as well as in sowing, afforestation, and artificial rainfall.

According to statistics, of the cultivated land area in China that suffered from locust plagues this year, 42% was treated by civil aircraft, including locust areas in more than 50 counties and districts in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Gansu, and Xinjiang provinces and regions. When the locusts occurred in Hebei Province, it was the busy season for wheat harvesting and summer planting, and the labor force was relatively tight. At that time, the state dispatched seven aircraft to conduct one month of powder spraying and control in the locust areas of seven counties and cities, eliminating locusts on an area of ​​2.03 million mu. The insecticidal efficiency was generally above 90%, and in some areas, all locusts were killed.

Civil aircraft have also achieved remarkable results in spraying pesticide powder to prevent wheat rust, wheat blossom midge, armyworms, and aphids, to prevent pests during the cotton budding and boll stage, and to prevent rice blast and rice borers. Sanyuan County in Shaanxi Province has two irrigation areas, the Jinghui Canal and the Qinghui Canal, which are rich in cotton. During the budding and boll-forming period of cotton, aircraft were used for 25 days of control based on the growth of pests such as pink bollworm and cotton bollworm, and the insecticidal effect was very good.

Civil aircraft have controlled pests such as pine caterpillars, flower flies, and inchworms in some forest areas of Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Gansu, Henan, and other provinces and regions, and have sown tree seeds and grass seeds in deserts and barren mountains in more than ten counties.

According to various calculations, the use of aircraft for pest control has the following five major advantages: saving labor; saving pesticides; low cost; good effect; fast speed and less loss. For example, the work of using aircraft to control pests during the cotton budding and boll stage in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, treated nearly 100,000 mu of cotton fields. Compared with manual control, it saved more than 30,000 labor days, more than 19,000 jin of pesticides, and more than 30,000 yuan in prevention and control costs; moreover, the pesticide droplets sprayed by aircraft are fine, highly concentrated, and have strong adhesion, and the insecticidal effect of spraying a pesticide once is better than spraying twice manually. In Hebei Province, using aircraft to kill locusts, each aircraft can spray more than 25,000 mu of powder per day, which is equivalent to more than 30,000 manual labor, and the average cost of aircraft locust control per mu is less than one-fifth of the cost of manual locust control.

In order to enable civil aircraft to better serve agricultural and forestry production, this year the number of captains engaged in agricultural aviation in China's civil aviation departments has more than doubled compared with 1958; the civil aviation departments have also refitted an "Ilyushin-14" aircraft specifically for sowing and afforestation.

### 扑灭虫害　播种造林　人工降雨  民用航空为农业林业立功

　　扑灭虫害　播种造林　人工降雨
    民用航空为农业林业立功
    据新华社讯　1959年，我国民用航空在十七个省、市、自治区的一百多个县，进行了多种多样的航空作业，有力地支援了农业、林业生产的发展。从大兴安岭的林海上空、麦浪滚滚的冀鲁豫平原、关中泾惠渠两岸的棉田沃野；一直到西北的沙漠地带和四川大凉山地区的荒山秃岭，民用飞机在扑灭农作物、森林的病虫害，以及播种、造林和人工降雨等方面，都取得了良好的效果。
    据统计，在今年我国发生蝗虫灾害的耕地面积中，有42％是由民用飞机进行防治的，包括河北、黑龙江、江苏、安徽、山东、河南、甘肃和新疆等省、区五十多个县境内的蝗虫地区。河北省在蝗虫发生时，正值麦收夏种的农忙季节，劳动力比较紧张。当时，国家派出了七架飞机，分别在七个县、市的蝗虫区，进行了一个月的喷粉除治，扑灭蝗虫的面积达二百零三万亩，杀虫效率一般都在90％以上，有的地区将蝗虫全部杀死。
    民用飞机在喷撒药粉防治小麦锈病、吸浆虫、粘虫、蚜虫，防治棉花蕾铃期的害虫，防治水稻瘟病、螟虫等方面，也获得了显著的成绩。陕西省三原县泾惠渠、清惠渠两个灌溉区盛产棉花，在棉花吐蕾、结铃的时候，根据红铃虫、棉铃虫等虫害生长情况，使用飞机进行了二十五天的防治，杀虫效果很好。
    民用飞机在内蒙古、湖南、甘肃、河南等省区的一些林区，防治了松毛虫、花蝇、尺蠖等虫害，并且在十多个县的沙漠和荒山播种了树种和草种。
    据各种计算，使用飞机防治虫害，有以下五大好处：节省劳动力；节省药剂；成本低；效果好；速度快，损失少。例如，陕西省三原县用飞机防治棉花蕾铃期害虫的工作，一共防治了近十万亩棉田，它和人工防治比较，节省了三万多个劳动日，一万九千多斤药剂，三万多元防治费用；而且飞机喷洒药剂的雾点细，浓度高，粘着力强，喷洒一次药剂的杀虫效果，比人工喷洒两次还好。河北省用飞机灭蝗，每架飞机每天能喷粉二万五千亩以上，顶得上三万多个手工劳动，而飞机灭蝗费用平均每亩还不到人工灭蝗费用的五分之一。
    为了使民用飞机更好地为农业和林业生产服务，今年我国民用航空部门从事农业航空的机长，比1958年增加了两倍多；民用航空部门还改装了一架专门用来播种造林的“伊尔十四”型飞机。
