    Thoroughly Eliminate Hidden Rice Stem Borers
    You County, Hunan, and Ningbo Special District, Zhejiang, Pull Out Rice Stubble and Dig Up Rice Roots
    (Our Dispatch) You County, Hunan, on the basis of preliminary success in pest control using the "Three Clearances" (clearing rice field stubble, clearing weeds, and plowing the fields), further mobilized the masses to pull up and burn all the rice stubble in green manure seedling fields, thoroughly eliminating overwintering rice stem borers hidden in the stubble. In eliminating overwintering rice stem borers from green manure fields, the county organized more than 60,000 laborers, adopting a method that combined individual responsibility and collective assault. In ten days, they pulled up and burned more than 315,000 mu of rice stubble in green manure fields, accounting for more than 90% of the total area of green manure fields, giving the overwintering rice stem borers a devastating blow. While engaged in pest control, various communes also accumulated a large amount of fertilizer.
    You County's "Three Clearances" pest control campaign this year was launched earlier and more forcefully than in the past. After basically concluding the "Three Autumns" campaign and launching a winter production upsurge centered on water and fertilizer, the county arranged for more than 54,000 laborers to vigorously engage in the "Three Clearances" pest control campaign. All 523,000 mu of rice fields were cleared of weeds around the edges, achieving a smooth surface on all three sides of the field ridges. The rice stubble was universally dug up in more than 150,000 mu of winter fallow fields. However, insufficient attention was paid to pest control in green manure fields, and the stubble inside was not cleared. Yan Mingrun, the first secretary of the county party committee, and comrades from the office inspected eight rice stubbles in the green manure fields of the Jiangkou Brigade in the Caihuaping Commune and found 49 rice stem borer pupae. Using this vivid example, they convened local cadres to calculate three accounts: (1) each stubble contains six rice stem borer pupae, and even with a 50% overwintering mortality rate, more than 60,000 remain per mu. If allowed to reproduce, there could be tens of millions next year, and these pests will cause very serious damage to next year's rice crop; (2) it only takes three to four work points per mu to pull stubble this year, but even if two to three times more work points are spent on repeated pest control in the early and late seasons next year, it will be difficult to eradicate them completely; (3) pulling stubble this winter can also be combined with burning ash to accumulate fertilizer. Leaving pests behind will not only require more labor next year but also the use of much more pesticide. At the same time, pulling up the stubble is very beneficial for the growth of green manure and the plowing and harrowing of fields next year. Through this accounting, the cadres' understanding was improved, and the commune party committee immediately convened a meeting, mobilizing more than 5,000 people to take action overnight. Immediately afterward, the county party committee convened a telephone conference of the first secretaries of the commune party committees, analyzing the habit of rice stem borers generally overwintering inside rice stubble, pointing out that the county had sown more than 390,000 mu of green manure this year, accounting for more than 68% of the paddy field area. Failure to eliminate the stubble in the green manure fields would leave a breeding ground for pests. At the same time, the slogan "Pull up and burn all the rice stubble in the green manure fields, leaving not a single stubble, not a single root, cutting the grass and eliminating the roots, completely annihilating them" was put forward, and another "Three Clearances" pest control campaign lasting ten days was launched, realizing the goal of no rice stubble in any of the green manure fields.
    On the basis of raising awareness and unifying understanding, each production unit rationally arranged labor and put forward specific requirements. More than 65,000 laborers were mobilized throughout the county, forming more than 32,000 pest control groups. Combined with accumulating fertilizer and building water conservancy projects, they launched a concentrated assault on pulling rice stubble, quickly launching a new upsurge in mass pest control. Under the leadership of Liu Yangchun, a member of the county party committee and the first secretary of the Xinshi Commune party committee, the method of concentrating manpower and removing stubble in large areas was adopted, and more than 26,000 mu of rice stubble were pulled up in one night. The Jiubujiang Commune implemented a system of assigning tasks to teams and individuals, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. The number of commune members who went to work to pull stubble at night increased from more than 2,000 to more than 5,000. At the same time, various communes also organized more than 25,000 female semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers to specialize in pulling rice stubble. The Chengguan Commune organized more than 520 auxiliary laborers to pull rice stubble, implementing the "Five Determinations" method of assigning people, fields, time, quality, and remuneration. After this, the work efficiency of pulling rice stubble per person per day increased from 2.4 mu to 3.6 mu.
    In order to thoroughly eliminate pests and ensure the quality of pest control, various places also put forward the quality requirements of "Two Cleannesses and Three Sides," achieving complete removal of stubble and thorough inspection of roots; pulling, collecting, and burning simultaneously, so that the pests would have no descendants. After pulling the rice stubble, the Caihuaping Commune also universally applied an indigenous pesticide, which killed both rice stem borer pupae and controlled pests in green manure, achieving two goals at once and yielding even greater results.
    Various places also universally combined burning ash with accumulating fertilizer when pulling rice stubble. The seven communes, including Zhiyantangpu, used a method of alternating layers of rice stubble, weeds, and dry soil, accumulating more than 3.25 million dan of compost in ten days.
    (Our Dispatch) In the winter pest and disease eradication campaign centered on digging up rice roots throughout the Ningbo area of Zhejiang Province, the focus was tightly grasped on tool reform, which resulted in rapid progress. As of November 24, according to incomplete statistics, more than 723,000 mu of rice roots have been dug up and destroyed throughout the area, and 1,013 production teams have basically dug up and destroyed all the rice roots.
    In the campaign to attack and dig rice roots, various places in the Ningbo Special District, in order to improve work efficiency and ensure that grass seeds were not lost, focused on the link of reforming tools and improving efficiency. Currently, more than 125,000 new-style rice root digging tools such as fishtail shovels, chicken heart shovels, and single-sided quick shovels have been promoted throughout the area, of which more than 100,000 have been used. After trial use in various places, it has been proven that these rice root digging tools have the advantages of low cost, less soil carried, no damage to grass seeds, and convenient manufacturing. Using these tools to dig rice roots, one person can dig up to three mu per day, which is more than twice as efficient as using old-fashioned rice root digging tools. In order to ensure that there were enough tools, handicraft workers in various counties and communes were also urgently mobilized to rush production day and night. For example, the industrial front in Yuyao County specifically arranged 60 stoves, extracted 269 iron workers, and rushed to produce fishtail shovels and chicken heart shovels. By November 18, more than 28,000 had been produced.
    In the rice root digging campaign, leading cadres at all levels personally went to the fields, participated in and commanded the battle, and timely summarized and exchanged experiences in winter pest control. Zhang Zhaowan, secretary of the Ningbo Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, participated in digging rice roots with commune members in the Gulin Commune. Due to the promotion of new-style tools and the assistance of the production team in properly arranging labor, the average work efficiency here increased to three mu dug per person per day. The party committee secretary of the Shangdong Commune in Sheng County promoted the experience of intercropping radishes in grass seedling fields where rice roots had been dug during labor participation. The Huatang Production Team of this commune intercropped a season of radishes in a mu of grass seedling field where rice roots had been dug last year (sown in November, sown in the holes where the rice roots were dug, covered with ash, and harvested 4,000 jin of radishes in February of the following year. The yield of grass seeds was higher than usual). The Shangdong Commune will apply this experience and intercrop 7,000 mu of radishes throughout the commune.

    干干净净消灭潜藏的螟虫
    湖南攸县和浙江宁波专区扯光禾蔸掘掉稻根
    本报讯　湖南攸县在取得“三光”（稻田禾蔸挖光、杂草铲光、田犁光）治虫初步成绩的基础上，又发动群众把绿肥草子田的禾蔸全部扯掉、烧光，彻底消灭藏在禾蔸里的越冬螟虫。在消灭绿肥田越冬螟虫中，全县组织了六万多劳力，采用专人包干和集体突击相结合的方法，十天时间，扯光、烧掉了三十一万五千多亩绿肥田的禾蔸，占绿肥田总面积的90％以上，给越冬螟虫一次毁灭性打击。各公社结合治虫，还积制了大量肥料。
    攸县今年的“三光”治虫运动，比以往抓得早，抓得狠，全县在基本结束“三秋”运动、掀起以水肥为中心的冬季生产高潮时，即安排了五万四千多劳力大搞“三光”治虫运动，五十二万三千亩稻田，全部铲光了田边杂草，做到了田塍三面光。十五万多亩冬闲田，普遍挖光了禾蔸。可是，对绿肥田的治虫却重视不够，没有清除里面的禾蔸。县委第一书记阎明润和办公室的同志在菜花坪公社江口大队的绿肥田里检查了八个禾蔸，即有四十九条螟蛹。他们用这一生动的事例召集当地干部算了三笔账：（1）每蔸有螟蛹六条，越冬死亡50％，每亩还有六万多条，任其繁殖，明年可达几千万条，这些害虫将对明年的水稻带来十分严重的损失；（2）今年每亩扯禾蔸只需要花工三到四分，明年早、晚两季反复治虫尽管多花工二到三倍，也很难彻底扑灭；（3）今冬扯掉禾蔸，还可以结合烧灰积肥。留下虫害，不但明年要多花劳力，而且要多用很多农药。同时，扯掉禾蔸，对绿肥生长和明年的犁耙田地都有很大好处。通过算账，使干部提高了认识，公社党委当即召开会议，发动五千多人，连夜行动。紧接着，县委召开了公社党委第一书记电话会议，分析了螟虫一般躲在禾蔸里面过冬的习惯，指出了全县今年播种绿肥三十九万多亩，占水田面积的68％以上，如不消灭绿肥田的禾蔸，将给害虫留下繁殖基地；同时提出了“将绿肥田的禾蔸全部扯掉烧光，一蔸不留，一根不剩，斩草除根，全部歼灭”的口号，再一次开展了一个以十天为期的“三光”治虫运动，实现绿肥田丘丘无禾蔸。
    在提高思想、统一认识的基础上，各生产单位合理安排劳力，提出具体要求。全县出动六万五千多劳力，组成三万二千多个除虫组，结合积肥、兴修水利，突击扯禾蔸，很快掀起了群众突击治虫的新高潮。新市公社在县委委员、公社党委第一书记刘阳春同志的带动下，采用集中人力、成片拔除的办法，当晚扯光禾蔸二万六千多亩。酒埠江公社实行划片包干任务到组到人，大大调动了群众的积极性，晚上出工扯禾蔸的社员由二千多人增加到五千多人。与此同时，各公社还组织了二万五千多妇女半劳力和辅助劳力专门扯禾蔸。城关公社组织五百二十多个辅助劳力扯禾蔸，实行定人、定田、定时间、定质量、定报酬的“五定”办法后，每人每天扯禾蔸的工效由二点四亩，提高到三点六亩。
    为了干净彻底消灭虫害，保证治虫质量，各地还提出了“二净三边”的质量要求，做到了蔸蔸扯净，根根检净；边扯、边收、边烧，叫虫害绝子灭孙。菜花坪公社在扯了禾蔸以后，并普遍打了一次土农药，既杀了螟蛹又治了绿肥的虫害，一举两得，收效更大。
    各地在扯禾蔸时，还普遍结合烧灰积肥。只鸭塘铺等七个公社运用一层禾蔸、一层杂草、一层干土的办法，十天就积堆肥三百二十五万多担。
    本报讯　浙江省宁波地区在全面开展以掘稻根为中心内容的冬季治虫灭病突击运动中，紧紧抓住了工具改革，因而进展迅速。到11月24日止，据不完全统计，全区已掘毁稻根七十二万三千多亩，有一千零十三个生产队基本上把稻根全掘毁。
    在突击掘稻根运动中，宁波专区各地为了提高工效，保证不损失草子，都抓住了改革工具、提高效率这一环节。目前全区已经推广了鱼尾铲、鸡心铲、单面快铲等掘稻根新式工具十二万五千多把，其中已经使用的有十万多把。经各地试用证明，这几种掘稻根工具都具有成本低、带泥少、不损草子、制造方便的优点。用这些工具掘稻根，一人一天可掘到三亩，比用旧式的掘稻根工具工效高一倍以上。为了保证有足够的工具，各县、社的手工业工人也都紧急动员起来，日夜赶制。如余姚县工业战线就专门安排了六十台炉灶，抽出二百六十九名铁业工人，突击赶制鱼尾铲、鸡心铲，到11月18日，已赶制了二万八千多把。
    在掘稻根的运动中，各级领导干部都亲自下田，参加和指挥战斗，及时总结和交流冬季治虫的经验。宁波市委书记处书记张兆万在古林公社和社员一起参加掘稻根，由于推广了新式工具，帮助生产队妥善安排了劳力，使这里的平均工效提高到每人每天掘三亩。嵊县上东公社党委书记在参加劳动过程中，推广了在掘掉稻根的草子田里套种萝卜的经验。这个公社的华堂生产队去年在一亩掘掉稻根的草子田里套种了一季萝卜（11月播下，播在掘掉稻根的孔里，盖上草木灰，来年2月收萝卜四千斤，草子的产量比一般的还高）。上东公社将根据这项经验，在全社套种萝卜七千亩。
