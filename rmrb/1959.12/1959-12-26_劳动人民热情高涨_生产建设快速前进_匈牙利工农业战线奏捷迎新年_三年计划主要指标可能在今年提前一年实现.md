　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 24th: This reporter reports: The basic situation on Hungary's industrial and agricultural production fronts this year is good. The laboring people have achieved great victories in their struggle to complete the major targets of the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) ahead of schedule.

　　In industry, enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Light Industry have already completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. It is expected that by the end of the year, heavy industrial enterprises will overfulfill their production tasks, labor productivity, and production cost targets by 6%-7%, 6%, and 3% respectively. Enterprises in the metallurgy and machine manufacturing, mining, electricity, and chemical industries sectors had already reached the 1960 level in terms of output value in October, and are rapidly advancing into 1961.

　　An important feature of Hungary's industrial and agricultural production fronts this year is that all economic sectors have continued to maintain or improve the pace of rapid advancement that appeared in the first year of the Three-Year Plan last year. In industry, the Three-Year Plan stipulates that industrial output value in 1960 will increase by 22% compared to 1957, but it increased by 12% last year compared to 1957 (the original plan was 7%). Based on the current progress, it is estimated that industrial output value will increase by at least 12% compared to last year by the end of this year. This means that by the end of this year, this target of the Three-Year Plan will be overfulfilled one year ahead of schedule.

　　In agriculture, the Three-Year Plan stipulates that agricultural output value will increase by 12% during this period. Although grain production suffered a poor harvest last year due to drought, the livestock industry developed significantly, so the total agricultural output value still increased by 5% compared to 1957 (the original plan was 4.7%). This year, the original plan was to increase agricultural output value by 5.2% compared to last year, but due to the bumper grain harvest and the development of the livestock industry, it is expected that the annual plan will be overfulfilled and may reach the 1960 level stipulated in the Three-Year Plan.

　　The level of reducing production costs achieved this year will be higher than the original 1960 target; while labor productivity reached the 1960 target in the fourth quarter of this year.

　　Another feature of Hungary's industrial and agricultural production fronts this year is that the laboring people have shown extremely high political and labor enthusiasm. Since the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party made the decision to accelerate the socialist transformation of agriculture in December last year and issued the battle call to complete the major targets of the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule in March this year, the broad masses of laboring people immediately launched a wave of accelerating socialist construction, and the waves are rising higher and higher. Employees in various regions have successively launched various forms of labor competitions. In the competition, they further exerted their energy, tapped their potential, and constantly pushed production forward. Technological innovation and inventions have formed a broad mass movement. In order to welcome the convening of the Party's Seventh National Congress, employees in various industrial sectors had completed gift tasks worth 3.1 billion forints ahead of schedule in early November.

　　The mood of the broad masses of peasants is also very high. Encouraged by the Party Central Committee's decision last December, the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement reached a climax at the beginning of this year. In just three months, the number of peasant households and land joining cooperatives doubled. The peasants' enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly full, and this year's spring plowing and sowing work was completed the earliest in the past decade. This year, the yield of bread grains per hectare of land in agricultural cooperatives was 10% to 25% higher than that of individual farmers.

　　Based on the achievements already made, the 1960 National Economic Development Plan recently adopted by the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government stipulates that industrial output value next year should increase by at least 8% compared to the level reached at the end of this year, and agricultural output value will increase by 4.9% compared to this year. Now, the broad masses of laboring people in Hungary are confidently heading towards the new year. In order to welcome the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the motherland and to create a higher starting point for the second Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), many factory employees have decided to push the labor competition to a new peak.

　　劳动人民热情高涨  生产建设快速前进
    匈牙利工农业战线奏捷迎新年
    三年计划主要指标可能在今年提前一年实现
    据新华社布达佩斯24日电　本社记者报道：匈牙利今年工农业生产战线的基本形势良好，劳动人民在争取提前完成三年计划（1958—1960年）主要指标的斗争中已经获得了巨大的胜利。
    在工业方面，目前重工业和轻工业部所属企业已经提前完成了年度计划；预计到年底重工业企业将分别超额6％—7％、6％和3％完成生产任务、劳动生产率和生产成本指标。冶金和机器制造、矿业、电力和化学工业部门的企业，还在10月份就在产值方面提前达到了1960年的水平，快马加鞭进入了1961年。
    匈牙利今年工农业生产战线上的一个重要特点是，各经济部门都继续保持或提高了去年——三年计划第一年就已出现的快速前进的步伐。在工业方面，三年计划规定，1960年工业产值将比1957年增长22％，但去年就比1957年提高了12％（原计划为7％）。根据目前已完成的情况来看，预计，今年工业产值到年底至少也将比去年增长12％。这就是说，到今年年底，三年计划的这项指标就将提前一年超额完成。
    在农业方面，三年计划规定，在这期间农业产值将增长12％。去年虽然谷物生产因天旱而歉收，但畜牧业发展较大，所以农业总产值仍比1957年增加5％（原订计划为4.7％）。今年农业产值原订将比去年增加5.2％，但由于谷物的丰收和畜牧业的发展，预计将超额完成年度计划，并且可能达到三年计划规定的1960年的水平。
    今年降低生产成本所达到的水平，将高于原订1960年的指标；而劳动生产率在今年第四季度就已达到了1960年的指标。
    匈牙利今年工农业生产战线上的另一个特点是，劳动人民表现出了十分高涨的政治和劳动热情。自社会主义工人党中央委员会在去年12月作出加速农业社会主义改造的决议，并在今年3月提出提前一年完成三年计划主要指标的战斗号召以后，广大的劳动群众立即掀起了加速社会主义建设的浪潮，而且一浪高于一浪。各地的职工相继展开了各种形式的劳动竞赛。他们在竞赛中进一步发挥干劲，挖掘潜力，把生产不断推向前进。技术革新和发明创造形成了广泛的群众运动。为迎接党的第七次代表大会的召开，各工业部门的职工在11月初就超计划完成了价值三十一亿福林的献礼任务。
    广大的农民的情绪也十分高涨。在党中央去年12月决议的鼓舞下，农业合作化运动的发展在今年年初就达到了高潮，在短短的三个月内，加入合作社的农户和土地就增加了两倍。农民的生产热情空前饱满，今年的春耕春播工作是十年来完成得最早的一次。今年农业合作社每霍尔特土地的面包谷物的产量比个体农民高10％到25％。
    根据已经取得的成就，匈牙利工农革命政府最近通过的1960年国民经济发展计划规定，明年的工业产值至少要比今年年底达到的水平增加8％，农业产值将比今年增长4.9％。现在，匈牙利广大劳动人民正在满怀信心地走向新的一年。为了迎接祖国解放十五周年，为了给第二个五年计划（1961—1965）创造更高的起点，许多工厂职工已经决定要把劳动竞赛推向新的高峰。
