    Photo
    Huang Dongping, an overseas Chinese from Indonesia. A photo sent abroad, parted from the Northeast Forestry Farm, crossed mountains and oceans, and rested in the hands of the old man. In the photo, a big man from the north, in worker's clothes, his eyes shining, his smiling mouth square: Ah, where did this good lad come from, so wonderful! The old man rubbed his eyes and looked again and again, tears of joy sparkling in his eyes: I wouldn't dare to dream that he is my weak and lazy Alang… Waves rose in the old man's heart, and years of gloom suddenly cleared. The truth he admired most is all in the photo: the motherland has forged him from scrap iron into steel! Holding the photo, he thought of these ten years, gazing at the place where the miracle occurred. The motherland, like a huge magnet, has since tightly drawn his heart!

    印度尼西亚华侨　黄东平一张寄往海外的照片，别离了东北林场，越过群山、渡过重洋，停留在老阿伯的手上。照片里一个北方大汉，一身工人装，两眼发光，笑开的嘴巴四方方：啊，哪来的好小子真棒！阿伯揉着眼睛看了又看，欢乐的泪珠在他眼里闪亮：梦里也不敢想望他是我那瘦弱懒散的阿郎……老人的心掀起了一个个波浪，多年的阴云登时开朗。他最折服的真理全在照片上：祖国给他把废铁铸炼成钢！捧着照片想起这十年岁月，遥望着那产生奇迹的地方。祖国，像一块巨大的磁石，从此把他的心紧紧吸上！
