Mechanization of Manual Operations, Jumping Off the Yellow Ox and Riding a Swift Horse
Tianjin Workers Vigorously Create Indigenous and Foreign Machinery
The Labor Productivity of Six Industrial Bureaus in November Increased by More Than 20% Compared to October

(Our Newspaper Tianjin, December 18th, Reporter Huang Jun reports:) In Tianjin, the technical revolution and technical innovation movement centered around mechanization and semi-mechanization is developing in depth in nine major industries, including shoemaking, weaving, sock weaving, glass, paper products, carpets, rubber, salt industry, and small hardware products, and in six major types of work, including porters, pulverizers, forging workers, packaging workers, fitters, and foundry workers. Mechanization of lifting and loading, conveyor belt transportation of products, pipeline transportation of liquids, and specialization, automation, continuity, combination, and high-speed operation of mechanical production are constantly emerging. Mechanization and semi-mechanization have begun to show tremendous power in production. According to statistics from six industrial bureaus, labor productivity in November increased by 20.21% compared to October. Among the 1,800 hand-cranked sock knitting machines in the sock weaving industry, 60% have been converted into electric sock knitting machines, significantly increasing the industry's degree of mechanization, ensuring the early completion of this year's plan, and allowing for the transfer of more than 300 people to support other production departments. In the fourteen machinery factories and nine iron foundries in Hongqiao District, the proportion of foundry workers, forging workers, and ramming machine workers using mechanical operations has increased from 17.8% to 37.7% through vigorous mechanization, greatly reducing labor intensity and doubling production efficiency. Workers sing, "Technical innovation is powerful, physical labor is mechanized, jumping off the yellow ox and riding a swift horse, and the factory blooms with leaping flowers."

At the beginning of November, after the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee issued a call to the vast workers on the city's industrial front to advance towards mechanization and semi-mechanization, from the iron and steel and machinery industries to the light and textile industries, from large factories with a higher degree of mechanization to small factories where manual labor accounted for the vast majority, from direct production departments to auxiliary production departments, the workers were all overjoyed and enthusiastically threw themselves into the battle with unparalleled ambition, quickly setting off a broad-scale technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization. Veteran workers formed "Huang Zhong Teams," young workers formed "Youth Shock Brigades," female workers formed "Mu Guiying Groups," and technical personnel and office cadres formed "Research Groups," vowing to compete in skills and seize projects around the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization, and vigorously develop "amateur processing factories." Forging workers, pulverizers, and porters proposed to put down their hammers and shoulder poles; foundry workers and packaging workers proposed to eliminate heavy physical labor such as pushing, pulling, carrying, lifting, and shouldering; shoemakers proposed to change the manual operation methods of "poking one eye with one awl and hammering one nail with one hammer." Many factories also held mechanization and semi-mechanization exhibitions, on-site meetings, observation meetings, and experience exchange meetings in various forms, forming a vibrant and flourishing scene. The forty factories in Hedong District established 984 "contracting groups," "shock teams," and "amateur processing factories," with more than 18,000 people participating. In a very short period of time, they renovated 989 machines and equipment and manufactured 411 new pieces of equipment.

Strengthening leadership, overall planning, layer-by-layer planning, clear direction, and implementing while planning are the distinct characteristics of Tianjin's industrial front in carrying out the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement. From the city to the district, from the bureau to the factory, Party committees at all levels personally led the effort and established mechanization headquarters or leading groups. The city focused on nine major industries and six major types of work, formulated comprehensive mechanization and semi-mechanization plans, from replacing manual operations with machines, to taking departments with a higher degree of mechanization to the next level, and to eliminating heavy physical labor in auxiliary departments. In order to solve the key problems in completing the annual plan ahead of schedule and actively prepare for continued leaps forward next year, each industrial bureau, industry, and factory formulated specific plans based on the principle of combining long-term goals with current needs, fundamentally changing the backward state of equipment in a planned and step-by-step manner. The chemical, mechanical, textile, metallurgical, electrical, and light industries alone planned 2,075 major measures. After all these plans are realized, the city's degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization will increase from 43% at the beginning of the year to 65%, which can ensure the realization of continued leaps forward next year without increasing or slightly increasing the number of people. Many industries and factories took the approach of combining leading cadres, veteran workers, and technical personnel to take swift action while formulating plans, achieving both planning and implementation. While mobilizing the masses to discuss, supplement, revise, and formulate mechanization and semi-mechanization plans, the First Vehicle Tool Factory mobilized the masses to immediately address the critical projects in production that urgently needed to be solved, adopting a method of assigning responsibilities at different levels to quickly achieve results. The factory level established a "three-way combination" headquarters to arrange major projects; general projects were assigned to workshops and teams to be responsible for implementation. In addition to establishing command teams and assigning specific personnel to be responsible, each workshop also adopted methods of announcing projects and mobilizing employees to "grab topics" and "seize watermelons," implementing while planning, and quickly achieving practical results. The factory proposed ten major measures, such as making automatic grinding machines, hot rolling machines, and handle bending machines for tile rings to replace manual labor and reduce the heavy labor of workers, which were quickly realized by the employees before the plan was even finalized, greatly improving work efficiency. An automatic grinding machine made by workers using waste materials can do the work of four people before.

In vigorously carrying out mechanization and semi-mechanization, all factories adhered to the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods." Many factories did not have equipment, so they manufactured it themselves; they did not understand technology, so they worked hard to study it; if there was a shortage of iron and steel materials, they used bamboo and wood instead. In the First Paper Products Factory, nine of the ten processes for making paper bags were purely physical labor, which was both tiring and slow. It was originally planned to invest 1.05 million yuan to add three automatic tube-making machines, but they could not be bought for more than a year. Recently, the employees successfully manufactured an iron-wood structure automatic tube-making machine using wood and scrap iron, which can replace six manual paper bag making processes. Originally, it took 61 people to operate and produce 36,000 cement bags per day. After using the machine, only five people can produce the same number of paper bags, and the quality qualification rate has also increased from the original 95% to 100%. The molding workshop of the Dazhonghua Rubber Factory originally planned to install a conveyor belt, which required an investment of 100,000 yuan and could not be used until half a year later. Now, in a very short period of time, the workers used waste materials and only spent more than 500 yuan to make six conveyor belts, which basically realized conveyor belt transportation in the rubber rolling and molding workshops, saving more than 12,000 yuan in tool costs and transportation costs per year, and saving 20 laborers.

Mass collaboration between industries and factories, promoting the rapid increase in the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization, is one of the experiences of Tianjin in carrying out this movement. In vigorously carrying out mechanization and semi-mechanization, many industries and factories proposed communist collaboration slogans such as "mutual support, those who are able do more work," "mechanical and electrical help light industry," "large factories help small factories," and "those with good technical conditions help those with poor technical conditions," not only sharing materials, equipment, and manpower, but also complementing each other technically. In November, Hebei District organized factories to cooperate in solving more than 8,500 problems related to equipment, tools, materials, and technical forces. In order to realize the mechanization of iron hammering, eight factories with foundry work divided the work according to the equipment situation. The Locomotive and Rolling Stock Parts Factory and the Medium-sized Machine Tool Factory were responsible for reviewing and drawing drawings, the Iron and Steel Plant was responsible for wood mold manufacturing, and the Machinery Repair Factory was responsible for the casting of the large shaft of the iron hammering machine. As a result, nine iron hammering machines were quickly manufactured, and all factories have realized the mechanization of iron hammering.

    手工操作机械化　跳下黄牛骑骏马
    天津职工大造土洋机械
    六个工业局11月的劳动生产率比10月猛增20％以上
    本报天津18日电　记者黄军报道：天津市工业战线上的制鞋、织布、织袜、玻璃、纸制品、地毯、橡胶、盐业、小五金制品等九大行业和搬运工、粉碎工、锻打工、包装工、钳工、铸工等六大工种以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革命、技术革新运动正在深入发展。起重装卸机械化，产品运输传送带化，液体流程管道化，机械生产专用化、自动化、连续化、组合化、高速化，接连不断出现。机械化和半机械化，在生产上已开始显示出巨大的威力。据六个工业局的统计，11月份的劳动生产率就比10月份提高了20.21％。织袜行业的一千八百台手摇织袜机，已有60％改装为电动织袜机，使全行业机械化程度显著提高，保证了今年计划的提前完成，并抽调出三百余人，支援其他生产部门。红桥区十四个机械工厂和九个铸铁工厂中的铸工、锻打工、捣机工，通过大搞机械化，使用机械操作的人数，由原来的17.8％提高到37.7％，劳动强度大大减轻，生产效率成倍增长。工人们歌颂说：“技术革新威力大，体力操作机械化，跳下黄牛骑骏马，工厂盛开跃进花”。
    11月初，中共天津市委向全市工业战线上的广大职工，发出向机械化、半机械化进军的号召以后，从钢铁、机械行业到轻工、纺织行业，从机械化程度较高的大工厂，到手工劳动占绝大比重的小工厂，从直接生产部门到辅助生产部门，职工们莫不欢欣鼓舞，以无比的雄心壮志紧张投入战斗，迅速掀起了一个规模广阔的以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。老工人们组成了“黄忠队”，青年工人组成了“青年突击队”，女工们组成了“穆桂英小组”，技术人员和科室干部组成了“研究小组”，围绕着实现机械化、半机械化誓师比武、抢课题抱西瓜、大搞“业余加工厂”。锻打工、粉碎工和搬运工提出要放下大锤和扁担；铸工、包装工们提出要消灭推、拉、背、端、扛等笨重体力劳动；制鞋工人提出要改变“一锥子扎一个眼、一鎯头砸一个钉”的手工操作方法。许多工厂还举办了机械化、半机械化展览会、现场会、观摩会、经验交流会，形式多种多样，形成了万紫千红遍地开花的局面。河东区的四十个工厂，就成立了“包打组”、“突击队”、“业余加工厂”等九百八十四个，参加的人数有一万八千多人。在很短的时间内，他们就改装机器设备九百八十九台、制造新设备四百一十一台。
    加强领导，全面规划，层层规划，方向明确，边规划，边实现，是天津市工业战线上开展机械化、半机械化运动的鲜明特点。从市到区，从局到厂，各级党委都亲自领导，成立了机械化指挥部或领导小组。全市以九大行业和六大工种为重点，从手工操作用机器代替、机械化程度较高的部门更上一层楼，辅助部门消灭笨重体力劳动等方面订出了全面的机械化、半机械化的规划。各工业局、行业和工厂为了既解决当前提前完成全年计划中的关键问题，又积极为明年的继续跃进作好准备，有计划有步骤地从根本上改变设备的落后状况，都根据远景和当前结合的方针作出了具体的规划。仅化学、机械、纺织、冶金、电机、经工等工业局就规化出了二千零七十五项重大措施。这些规划全部实现后，全市机械化、半机械化程度将由年初的43％提高到65％，可以在不增人或少增人的情况下保证实现明年的继续跃进。许多行业和工厂在制订规划的同时，采取领导干部、老工人和技术人员结合的办法迅速行动，作到边规划边实现。第一车具厂一边发动群众讨论、补充、修改、制订机械化、半机械化的规划，一边发动群众立即对生产上迫切需要解决的关键项目，采取分级负责的办法，迅速实现。厂级成立了“三结合”指挥部，对重大的项目进行安排；一般的项目分别交给车间和小组负责实现，各车间除成立指挥小组、规定专人负责外，还采取公布项目，发动职工“抢课题”“抱西瓜”的办法，一边规划一边实现，迅速收到实效。这个厂提出制作瓦圈自动磨光机、热卷机和煨把机等代替手工劳动、减经工人笨重劳动的十大项措施，未等规划制订好，就纷纷被职工提前实现，大大提高了工作效率。工人用废料作成的一台自动磨光机，一个人可作以前四个人的活。
    在大搞机械化、半机械化中，各个工厂都坚持了“土洋并举”的方针。许多工厂没有设备，就自己制造，不懂技术就刻苦钻研，钢铁材料不足就利用竹、木代替。第一纸制品厂制作纸袋的十道工序中，有九道是纯体力劳动，又累又慢，原来确定投资一百零五万元，添置三台自动打筒机，一年多也没买成，最近职工们就利用木料和废铁制造成功了铁木结构的自动打筒机，可以代替手工作纸袋的六道工序，原来需要六十一个人操作，日产水泥袋三万六千个，使用机器后，只要五个人就能生产同样数量的纸袋，质量合格率也由原来的95％提高到百分之百。大中华橡胶厂成型车间原计划安装一条传送带，需要投资十万元，而且半年后才能使用。现在工人在很短的时间内，利用废旧物料，只花了五百多元就制成了六条传送带，使轧胶和成型车间基本实现了运输传送带化，一年就可节约工具费、运费一万二千多元，并节约了二十个劳动力。
    行业之间、工厂之间群众性的大协作，促进机械化和半机械化程度迅速提高，是天津市开展这一运动的经验之一。许多行业、工厂在大搞机械化、半机械化中，提出“互相支援，能者多劳”、“机电帮轻工”、“大厂帮小厂”、“技术条件好的帮助技术条件差的”等共产主义协作的口号，不仅从原材料、设备、人力方面互通有无，而且在技术方面互相补充。河北区在11月份组织各厂协作解决设备、工具、材料、技术力量的问题八千五百多起。有铸工工种的八个工厂为了实现砸铁机械化，根据设备情况进行分工，机车车辆配件厂和中型机床厂负责审核、绘制图纸，炼铁厂负责木型制造、机械修造厂负责砸铁机的大轴铸造等，结果很快制造出九台砸铁机，各厂都已实现了砸铁机械化。
