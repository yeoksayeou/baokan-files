Xinhua News Agency, Sofia Electric Dispatch: Bulgarian agricultural laborers are taking various measures to strive for a bumper harvest next year. At present, the autumn planting work has been successfully completed, and great achievements have also been made in the preparation for next year's spring planting. On the land where autumn planting has been completed, strong wheat seedlings have emerged, and many places are lush green. The topdressing and seedling replenishment teams of agricultural production cooperatives are working diligently in the fields.

This year, Bulgaria planted nearly 1.7 million decares of wheat, barley, and rye. As of the end of November, members of agricultural production cooperatives have replenished seedlings for approximately 2.5 million decares of autumn crops.

In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest next year, this year, in autumn plowing and autumn planting, members of agricultural production cooperatives have adopted various measures to ensure increased crop production, such as increasing fertilizer application, water conservancy irrigation, improving varieties, and scientific close planting.

Applying base fertilizer universally is a major measure in Bulgaria's autumn planting. This year, about 80% of the autumn crops were fertilized as base dressing, with an average of 15 to 20 kilograms of phosphate fertilizer applied per decare, and 6 to 8 kilograms of chemical fertilizer were topdressed. Last year, the land fertilized as base dressing accounted for only about 15%, and a total of only 15 kilograms of chemical fertilizer was applied per decare.

By the end of November, the irrigation canals for about 2 million decares of wheat and barley fields had been repaired and were ready to be flooded for irrigation at any time.

The widespread adoption of high-yield varieties is also an important measure to strive for a bumper crop harvest next year. This year, 70% of the wheat area of the national agricultural production cooperatives selected Bulgaria's high-yield variety (301), 20% used Memorial No. (2) and (3), and Italy's high-yield wheat varieties. This year's seed selection work has also been done well. More than 75% of the wheat varieties are clean, large-grained, first-class varieties. Last year, first-class wheat varieties accounted for only 42%.

In order to ensure the density of autumn crops, members of agricultural production cooperatives have changed the previous planting practices. The amount of seeds sown per decare is not calculated by kilogram, but by the number of grains. An average of 500 to 550 wheat seeds were sown per square meter of land.

While carrying out autumn planting, agricultural production cooperatives also carried out preparatory work for next year's spring planting—deep plowing. Up to now, agricultural cooperatives and state farms across the country have plowed about 13 million decares, completing more than 83% of the planned task.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest, more than 80% of the deeply plowed land for spring crops has been fertilized with an average of 15 to 20 kilograms of phosphate fertilizer as base dressing per decare. Among them, 500,000 decares of land has been fertilized with an average of two to three tons of farmyard manure as base dressing per decare.

### 保加利亚农民积极准备明年春播  追肥补苗大军奋战田野

    做好各项准备争取明年丰收
    保加利亚农民积极准备明年春播
    追肥补苗大军奋战田野
    新华社索非亚电　保加利亚农业劳动者正采取各种措施，争取明年丰收。目前，秋种工作已经胜利结束，明年春播的准备工作也获得了巨大成就。在完成了秋种的土地上，茁壮的麦芽已经出土，许多地方一片葱绿，农业生产合作社的追肥补苗的大军正在田野上辛勤劳动。
    今年保加利亚种上了近一百七十万狄卡尔小麦、大麦和黑麦。到11月底为止，农业生产合作社社员已经给约二百五十万狄卡尔的秋种作物补了苗。
    为了争取明年农业丰收，农业生产合作社的社员们今年在秋耕秋种中，采取了增施肥料、水利灌溉、改良品种、科学密植等各种保证农作物增产的措施。
    普遍施底肥是保加利亚秋种中的一大措施。今年秋种作物中有80％左右施了底肥，平均每狄卡尔上了十五到二十公斤磷肥，并且追施了六到八公斤化学肥料。而去年，施底肥的土地只占15％左右，每狄卡尔土地总共才施用了十五公斤化肥。
    到11月底，有二百万狄卡尔左右的小麦田和大麦田的灌溉渠道已经修整，随时可以放水浇地。
    广泛采用高产品种，也是争取明年农作物丰收的一个重要措施。今年全国农业生产合作社的小麦，70％的面积是选用了保加利亚的高产品种（301）、20％采用了纪念（2）号和（3）号和意大利的小麦高产品种。今年的选种工作也作得很好。75％以上的小麦品种是干净、颗粒大的一等品种。而去年用的一等小麦品种只占42％。
    为了保证秋种作物的密度，农业生产合作社社员们改变了以往播种的惯例，每狄卡尔播种的种籽量不是按公斤，而是按颗粒计算的。平均每平方米土地播下了五百到五百五十颗麦种。
    在进行秋种的同时，农业生产合作社还进行了明年的春种的准备工作——深翻地。到目前为止，全国农业社和国营农场已翻了约一千三百万狄卡尔，完成了预定任务的83％以上。
    为了争取丰收，80％以上的深耕了的春种作物地，平均每狄卡尔上了十五到二十公斤磷肥的底肥，其中有五十万狄卡尔土地，平均每狄卡尔土地上了两三吨厩肥的底肥。
