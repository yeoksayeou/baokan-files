According to a recent report in the Shaanxi Daily, the Philosophy and Social Sciences Group of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has held four general meetings since the beginning of October to criticize Comrade Yue Bangxun, Director of the Economic Research Institute of the Shaanxi Branch of the Academy of Sciences and teacher at the Shaanxi Provincial Party School of the Communist Party of China, for his right-opportunist views in economic theory. More than 30 people spoke at the four meetings. They pointed out that Comrade Yue Bangxun's right-opportunist theoretical views are concentrated and systematically reflected in his book "Several Basic Issues in Studying and Teaching Political Economy" (published by Shaanxi People's Publishing House). In this book, the author, like all revisionists, uses the banner of opposing "dogmatism" and Marxist-Leninist phrases as a cover to vigorously deny and confuse the class nature and Party spirit principles of Marxist economic theory; he makes various distortions and slanders of the socialist economy, and applies rouge and powder to the most reactionary force of modern times - monopoly capitalism.

The comrades who spoke first criticized Yue Bangxun's revision and distortion of the class viewpoint of Marxist political economy. They exposed Yue Bangxun's attempt to portray the main object of political economy as something without class content. When discussing the concept of production relations, he avoided the fundamental issue of the form of ownership of the means of production, and said that political economy is the study of contradictions between production, distribution, exchange, and consumption, as well as the laws of motion of these contradictions and the ways to resolve them. He discussed production relations in general terms, divorced from specific economic conditions, precisely in an attempt to blur the class nature of political economy. When discussing the main object of political economy, he did not first emphasize the study of the specific laws of various societies, but regarded general laws as the main object of study. In fact, without first studying the specific laws of various societies, political economy will become empty talk without combativeness. They exposed Yue Bangxun's views of beautifying capitalism and vilifying socialism, which are manifested in the following remarks: When discussing the capitalist economy, he asked readers not to "categorically assert the basic contradiction of capitalist society," and erroneously opposed grasping the basic contradiction of capitalism to analyzing capitalist economic relations in a pragmatic way. He opposed studying the superiority of socialist society, and deliberately believed that socialist public ownership easily "conceals contradictions," urging readers to first focus on studying the contradictions of socialist society. He wrongly believed that the sign determining whether a social system is superior is the level of productive forces, rather than whether the relations of production are suitable for the nature of the productive forces. This is precisely a poisonous arrow used by all revisionists to slander the socialist system.

The comrades who spoke believed that all of this not only demonstrated Yue Bangxun's absurdity and ignorance in economic theory, but also exposed his thorough right-opportunist views in politics. The comrades who spoke pointed out that to study the capitalist economy, one must first grasp the basic contradictions of capitalism in order to reveal the corrupt essence of capitalist production relations and the objective law that it will inevitably move towards death and be replaced by socialism. This is precisely a pragmatic attitude, because the basic contradictions of capitalism are objectively existent, and all revisionists' attempts to deny this objective fact with various lies are futile. To study the socialist economy, we must first focus on studying the superiority of the socialist economy in order to clearly understand the objective nature of socialist production relations in promoting the development of productive forces, as well as the objective conditions it possesses for the rapid development of productive forces, so as to consciously implement the Party's general line for socialist construction. Studying the superiority of the socialist economy does not exclude studying the non-antagonistic contradictions of socialism, but the purpose of studying the non-antagonistic contradictions of socialist society is to resolve the contradictions and enable socialist construction to develop at a higher speed. Everyone also refuted Yue Bangxun's fallacy of praising imperialism in theory and in fact, and proved with a large number of facts that the capitalist economy in the imperialist period is already thoroughly corrupt and has no positive effect, and that the intervention of the imperialist state power in the economy will inevitably lead to a wider and deeper economic crisis.

The comrades who spoke also criticized Yue Bangxun's consistent erroneous proposition of opposing the combination of theory with the current socialist revolution and socialist construction, opposing ideological transformation, and opposing enhancing Party spirit, pointing out the absurdity of his so-called "knowledge" is "Party spirit," and "without rich knowledge, there can be no true Party spirit," which is essentially opposing theory serving political struggle and serving the general line of socialist construction.

### 西安经济学界  批判岳邦珣的右倾机会主义观

    西安经济学界
    批判岳邦珣的右倾机会主义观点
    据陕西日报最近报道，中国科学院陕西分院哲学社会科学组，从10月上旬起召开了四次大会，批判科学院陕西分院经济研究所所长、中共陕西省委党校教员岳邦珣同志在经济理论方面的右倾机会主义观点。在四次大会上，先后有三十多人发了言。他们指出，岳邦珣同志的右倾机会主义理论观点，集中地系统地反映在他所著的“研究与讲授政治经济学的几个基本问题”一书（陕西人民出版社出版）中。在这本书里，作者和一切修正主义者一样，打着反对“教条主义”的招牌，并以马克思列宁主义的词句作为掩饰，极力否定和混淆马克思主义经济理论的阶级性和党性原则；对社会主义经济进行了种种歪曲和丑化，并为现代最反动的势力——垄断资本主义搽胭抹粉。
    发言的同志首先批判了岳邦珣同志对马克思主义政治经济学的阶级观点所作的修正和歪曲。他们揭露岳邦珣同志企图把政治经济学的主要研究对象说成是没有阶级内容的东西。他在论述生产关系这一概念时，对于生产资料所有制的形式这一基本问题避而不谈，而说政治经济学就是研究生产、分配、交换和消费之间的矛盾，以及这些矛盾运动规律和解决这些矛盾的途径的。他离开具体经济条件，泛论生产关系，正是企图模糊政治经济学的阶级性。他在论述政治经济学的主要对象时，不首先强调研究各类社会的特有规律，而把一般规律作为主要研究对象。事实上，不首先研究各类社会的特有规律，便会使政治经济学变成没有战斗性的空谈。他们揭露了岳邦珣同志美化资本主义丑化社会主义的观点，表现在下述言论中：他在论述资本主义经济时，要求读者不要“一口咬定资本主义社会的基本矛盾”，并把抓资本主义的基本矛盾同实事求是地分析资本主义经济关系，错误地对立起来。他反对研究社会主义社会的优越性，并且认为社会主义公有制容易“掩盖矛盾”，别有用心地要读者首先应着重研究社会主义社会的矛盾。他错误地认为，决定一种社会制度是否优越的标志是生产力水平，而不是看生产关系是否适合生产力的性质。这正是一切修正主义者诋毁社会主义制度的一支毒箭。
    发言的同志认为，所有这些，不仅仅说明了岳邦珣同志在经济理论上的荒谬与无知，同时也暴露了他在政治上的彻头彻尾的右倾机会主义观点。发言的同志指出，研究资本主义经济，必须首先抓住资本主义的基本矛盾，才能揭示资本主义生产关系腐朽的本质，以及它必然走向死亡而为社会主义所代替的客观规律，这正是实事求是的态度，因为资本主义的基本矛盾是客观存在，一切修正主义者想用各种谎言否认这种客观存在的事实，是徒劳无益的。研究社会主义经济，必须首先着重研究社会主义经济的优越性，这才能清醒的认识社会主义生产关系推动生产力发展的客观性质，以及它为生产力发展具备了一日千里的客观条件，从而自觉地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线。研究社会主义经济的优越性并不排斥研究社会主义的非对抗性矛盾，但是研究社会主义社会非对抗性矛盾的目的，是为了解决矛盾，使社会主义建设更高速度地发展。大家还从理论上和事实上驳斥了岳邦珣同志颂扬帝国主义的谬论，并以大量事实证明帝国主义时期的资本主义经济已经是腐朽透顶，毫无积极作用，而帝国主义的国家政权干预经济，则必然导致更广更深的经济危机。
    发言的同志还批判了岳邦珣同志一贯反对理论联系当前社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实际，反对改造思想，反对增强党性的错误主张，指出他的所谓“知识”就是“党性”、“没有丰富的知识，就不可能有真正的党性”的荒谬说法，实质上就是反对理论为政治斗争服务，为社会主义建设总路线服务。
