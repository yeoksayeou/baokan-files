　　Supplementing American-Made Aircraft
　　The West German Ministry of Defense announced that this month the West German Air Force will have another jet reconnaissance squadron enter service. The squadron is stationed near Munich and has thirty-six American-made "RF-84F" aircraft capable of firing lightning bombs. With this new squadron, the West German Air Force's current strength will be five fighter-bomber squadrons, three fighter squadrons, two reconnaissance squadrons, and two transport squadrons.

　　Stockpiling Various Munitions
　　According to the West German Social Democratic Party's newspaper "Vorwärts," the northern Eifel plateau in southwestern West Germany is being built into the West German Armed Forces' third-largest munitions storage center. In addition to the existing military buildings, the plan to establish a munitions base in the northern Eifel also stipulates that a training ground covering 12,000 hectares be expanded by 4,500 hectares to link it with a military training ground in Belgium; several central repair plants for the West German Air Force, a munitions factory, a central ammunition depot, and some missile launch pads will be constructed.

　　Inciting Anti-Soviet Sentiment
　　According to a recent report in "Neues Deutschland," during a tank exercise held by the West German Armed Forces last month, Bonn mercenaries dressed in Soviet uniforms and speaking broken Russian, practiced a so-called Soviet "invasion." They barged into public places with machine guns and harassed peaceful residents, attempting to stir up anti-Soviet hysteria.

　　Increasing Military Orders
　　According to the German Press Agency, the West German aircraft industry is preparing to accept military orders worth billions of marks from other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Netherlands intends to purchase two hundred West German-made American "Starfighter" aircraft, and Belgium and Italy also intend to purchase one hundred each. At the same time, arms industrialists from the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and other countries also hope to receive large military orders from West Germany. In the next year's West German budget, the Bonn Ministry of Defense has already earmarked 3.5 billion marks for the purchase of armaments.

　　Constantly Clamoring for Revenge
　　According to the German Press Agency, there are currently twenty reactionary groups in West Germany specializing in so-called "psychological warfare preparation." These groups have various names, such as the "Association for the Rescue of Freedom" and the "Association for Indivisible Germany." These reactionary organizations receive millions of marks in subsidies each year from the Adenauer government's "propaganda fund," constantly clamoring for the use of force to annex the German Democratic Republic and re-occupy the territories of Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria, and other countries.

　　Spreading Nazi Literature
　　The Minister of Education of Lower Saxony, West Germany, recently exclaimed that Nazis are distributing pro-Nazi literature in large quantities among schoolchildren, poisoning the minds of teenagers and children. According to him, at least 70,000 West German children have already joined neo-fascist organizations.

　　Placing SS Officers
　　In addition, the West German Police Union also stated that the vast majority of important positions in the police of North Rhine-Westphalia are occupied by former SS and secret police officers. For example, the senior police officers in the twelve major cities of the Ruhr area are all former SS officers.

    西德军国主义势力张牙舞爪
      补充美式飞机
    西德国防部宣布，本月中旬西德空军将又有一个喷气式侦察机联队参加服役。这个联队驻扎在慕尼黑近郊，拥有三十六架美制“RF—84F”能发射雷光弹的飞机。加上这个新联队，西德现役空军的实力将为五个战斗轰炸机联队、三个战斗机联队、两个侦察机联队和两个运输机联队。
      储存各色军火
    据西德社会民主党机关报“前进报”报道，西德西南部的埃弗尔高原北部正被建成为西德国防军的第三大军火储存中心。除原有的军用建筑物外，在北埃弗尔建立军火基地的计划还规定，把一处占地一万二千公顷的演习场再扩大四千五百公顷，以便使它同比利时境内的一处军事演习场相联接；修建几个西德空军的中心修理厂，一个弹药工厂，一个中心弹药库和一些安置各式导弹的发射台。
      煽动反苏情绪
    据“新德意志报”最近报道，在西德国防军上月份举行的一次坦克部队演习中，波恩雇佣兵竟穿上苏联军装、说着不成句的俄文演习所谓苏军的“入侵”。他们带着机关枪闯入公共场所向和平居民寻衅，企图煽起反苏歇斯底里。
      增加军事订单
    据德意志通讯社报道，西德飞机工业正准备接受来自北大西洋集团其他成员国的成十亿马克的军事订货。荷兰打算购买两百架西德仿造的美国“星式战斗机”，比利时与意大利也打算各购买一百架。在这同时，美、英、法、意等国军火工业家也希望得到西德的大笔军火订货。在下年度的西德预算中，波恩国防部已预定拨出三十五亿马克购买军火。
      成天叫嚣复仇
    据德意志通讯社报道，目前西德有着二十个专门从事所谓“心理作战准备”的反动团体，这些团体名目繁多，什么“拯救自由协会”啦、“不可分割的德国协会”啦等等。这些反动组织每年从阿登纳政府的“宣传基金”中领取成百万马克的津贴，成天叫嚣要用武力吞并德意志民主共和国和重新侵占波、捷、法、荷、意、奥等国的领土。
      传播纳粹读物
    西德下萨克森州教育部长不久前惊呼，纳粹分子正在学校儿童中间大量散发亲纳粹的读物，毒害青少年和儿童的心灵。据他说，目前至少已经有七万西德儿童加入了新法西斯组织。
      安插党卫军官
    另外，西德警察工会也说，北莱因威斯特伐利亚州警察中绝大多数重要职位都由前党卫军和秘密警察军官占据着。例如鲁尔区十二个大城市的高级警官都是前党卫军军官。　（新华社）（附图片）
    在西德屯纳斯堡建立起来一支经过美国训练的“诚实的约翰式”导弹部队。
    前希特勒匪帮的第三十九步兵团的一些军国主义分子，六月六日和七日在杜塞尔多夫举行示威，叫嚷战争。
