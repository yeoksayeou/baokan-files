    Xu Xuehui's Letter to Romanov
    Dear Comrade Romanov,

    Receiving your letter and reading it deeply moved me, and my heart was restless for a long time. I am excited that I may regain a pair of hands that can continue to work for the people. I sincerely thank the Soviet comrades who care for me like brothers and sisters, and I am even more grateful for the help you are about to give me. Dear Comrade Romanov, I will definitely use the hands you install for me to first tightly hold the hands you extend to me, and I must learn from the amazing perseverance you have shown after losing your hands. I have recently been on a journey because, after recovering from my injuries and being discharged from the hospital, I am traveling throughout the province at the invitation of young comrades from various places in our province. Wherever I go, I tell the comrades who welcome me that for the victory of socialism and communism, our young people must, under the leadership of the Party, develop a brave and strong character and must engage in loyal and creative labor. Dear comrade, I thank you for your concern, and I will definitely use more diligent labor to respond to your and other comrades' deep affection.
              Xu Xuehui

    徐学惠给洛玛诺夫的信
    亲爱的洛玛诺夫同志：
    接到你的信，读完以后，使我深受感动，内心长久不能平静，我为自己可能重新得到一双能为人民继续劳动的手而兴奋。我衷心感谢关心我的亲如兄弟姐妹的苏联同志们，我更感谢你们即将给予我的帮助。亲爱的洛玛诺夫同志，我一定要用你替我装上的手，最先紧紧地握着你伸给我的双手，一定要学习你失去双手之后所表现出来的惊人的毅力。我最近是在旅途中，原因是我伤愈出院后，应我们省里各地的青少年同志们的邀请，正在全省各地旅行。我每到一个地方都告诉欢迎我的同志们说：为了社会主义和共产主义事业的胜利，我们青年人必须在党的领导下，养成勇敢坚强的性格，必须进行忠诚的创造性的劳动。亲爱的同志，我谢谢你的关怀，我一定要用更勤奋的劳动来回答你和其他同志们的深情。
