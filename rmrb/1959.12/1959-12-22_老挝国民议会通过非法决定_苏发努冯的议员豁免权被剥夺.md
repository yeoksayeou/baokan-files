Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, December 21st: According to an Agence France-Presse report from Vientiane, the Lao National Assembly, under the manipulation of Lao reactionaries, outrageously passed a resolution on the 19th to strip Prince Souphanouvong and seven other members of the Lao Patriotic Front of their parliamentary immunity. Twelve members voted against this decision, which violates the Lao constitution, while thirty-three members voted in favor.

The Kingdom government's actions of arresting and imprisoning Souphanouvong and others, and this decision made by the Lao National Assembly, are both violations of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements regarding the integration of former Pathet Lao combat forces into national life.

It is reported that during the debate, Quinim Pholsena, chairman of the Lao Committee for the Advocacy of Peace and Neutrality, accused Lao Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone of violating the national constitution, illegally imprisoning members of parliament, and preventing them from attending parliamentary sessions.

    老挝国民议会通过非法决定
    苏发努冯的议员豁免权被剥夺
    据新华社21日讯　据法新社万象消息，老挝国民议会19日在老挝反动派操纵下，竟然通过剥夺苏发努冯亲王和另外七名老挝爱国战线党议员的议员豁免权的决定。表决时有十二位议员投票反对这项违反老挝宪法的决定，三十三名议员投票赞成这项决定。
    王国政府逮捕、监禁苏发努冯等人的行动和老挝国民议会作出的这一决定都是违反日内瓦协议和万象协议关于吸收前寮国战斗部队人员参加国家生活的条款的。
    据报道说，在辩论中，老挝拥护和平中立政策委员会主席贵宁·奔社那指责老挝首相萨纳尼空违反国家宪法，非法监禁议员，并且不让他们参加议会会议。
