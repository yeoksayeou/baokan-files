Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi Telegram: The workers of the Greater Khingan Range in Inner Mongolia are seizing the last month of this year to strive to complete the year's plan for increased timber production and conservation ahead of schedule.

    Not long ago, Yang Zhenqi, Zhang Fengge, and other pacesetters on the forestry production front who attended the National "Meeting of Heroes" returned to the forest area and proposed launching a red flag competition to complete the annual production increase and conservation plan ahead of schedule, driving the entire forest area to a socialist competition upsurge of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and helping the advanced. Workers are racing against time, and enthusiasm has overcome the severe cold and heavy snow. Many party and government leading cadres of forestry bureaus and forest farms have also gone deep into the mountains to participate in and lead production. Workers in all work processes are cooperating more closely. Repairmen follow the vehicles to troubleshoot in time and ensure normal production. The Yitulihe Forestry Bureau is vigorously developing ice road transportation, and workers have rushed to repair five ice roads in the past few days. Family members of the workers also go to the mountains to deliver boiling water and encourage the workers. Liu You, the automobile squad leader of the Daqilaha Forest Farm, pulled long trains on the ice and snow roads, towing five trailers, transporting 98 cubic meters of timber at a time, which is more than double the normal efficiency. Tractor driver Zhao Guofang competed with the automobiles, pulling six sleds on the ice road, transporting 93 cubic meters of timber at a time. This forestry bureau produced more than 6,100 cubic meters of timber on December 1, exceeding the plan by 74%.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Telegram: The Nanjing Automobile Factory, which won the red flag at the National Meeting of Heroes, is redoubling its efforts to ensure the completion of all planned targets for this year ahead of schedule and in an all-round and overfulfilled manner.

    The factory's Party committee recently mobilized the masses of workers to discuss the production plan for December at all levels, and identified one hundred and thirteen major key tasks for comprehensively completing various production plans and increasing the production of automobiles and internal combustion engines, so that all the factory workers clearly defined their goals and worked together from the factory to the workshop and team to vigorously tackle key problems and strictly control progress. At present, under the slogan of "Contributing Achievements, Contributing Experience, and Contributing Ideas to Ensure the Comprehensive and Overfulfilled Completion of This Year's Plan," the factory's workers have launched a vigorous technical innovation upsurge. Workshops, teams, and work sections have vigorously carried out technical performance competitions. By the 2nd, nearly 50% of the workers in each workshop had participated in the performances. The chassis workshop recently promoted seven advanced experiences through technical performance, including two non-stop wheel turning and non-stop center hole punching methods brought back by representatives of the National Meeting of Heroes. After the promotion of these methods, the processing efficiency of turners has generally increased by three to four times. The workers in the foundry workshop generally adopted the advanced shell-shaped centrifugal casting method, which not only accelerated the progress but also ensured the quality. Personnel from various departments also went to the workshops to work with the teams, helping the workshops solve specific problems and ensuring the comprehensive completion of this year's plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Baotou Telegram: The workers of the Baotou Machinery Factory are focusing on equipment matching, striving to ensure that all components of the main products within the annual plan are available, and that each machine can be delivered ahead of schedule or on time, to comprehensively and overfulfill the state plan.

    The Baotou Machinery Factory is a large machinery manufacturing factory in Baotou City, and it undertakes the processing and manufacturing tasks of thousands of tons of non-standard equipment for various newly built large, medium, and small industrial enterprises in Baotou City every year. In December, the factory also needs to process and match tens of thousands of large and small components and parts. In order to ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of the equipment matching task, under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, the factory's workers divided the area into sections, identified the parts that needed to be matched, and vigorously carried out technical innovation around various key points in production. Within the past four days, the factory's workers have put forward 373 technical innovation proposals. In addition, they also conducted technical performances around the weak links in production, so that advanced working methods quickly spread throughout the factory.

    In order to completely eliminate the backlog of work-in-progress, the factory's leading cadres and functional departments have also established a weekly two-day follow-up work system. Together with the workers, they incorporate the various advanced operating methods that constantly appear into the process regulations, and also establish a finished and semi-finished product transfer system to reduce the turnover process of semi-finished products.

    新华社牙克石电　内蒙古大兴安岭林区职工正在抓紧今年最后一个月，争取提前完成全年木材增产节约计划。
    不久以前出席全国“群英会”的杨振起、张凤阁等林业生产战线上的标兵回到林区后，提出了展开提前完成全年增产节约计划的红旗竞赛倡议，带动全林区掀起了学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的社会主义竞赛高潮。职工们争分夺秒地干，热情战胜了大雪严寒。许多林业局和林场的党政领导干部，也深入山场，参加生产领导生产。各工序工人更加密切协作。修理工跟着车走，及时排除故障，保证正常生产。伊图里河林业局大搞冰道运材，工人们近几天已经抢修了五条冰道。职工家属也上山送开水，鼓励工人干劲。大其拉哈林场汽车小队长刘有在冰雪道上拉长列车，牵引五节拖车，一次运材九十八立方米，比平时效率提高一倍多。拖拉机手赵国方和汽车比赛，在冰道上拉了六节爬犁，一次运材九十三立方米。这个林业局12月1日一天生产六千一百多立方米木材，超过计划74％。
    新华社南京电　荣获全国群英会红旗的南京汽车制造厂正在加倍努力，保证提前全面超额完成今年的各项计划指标。
    这个工厂的党委最近发动职工群众层层讨论了12月份的生产计划，排出了全面完成各项生产计划和增产汽车、内燃机的一百一十三项重大关键，使全厂职工人人明确了奋斗目标，从厂到车间、小组，同心协力猛攻关键、狠抓进度。目前，全厂职工在“献成绩、献经验、献计策，保证全面超额完成今年计划”的口号下，掀起了轰轰烈烈的技术革新高潮。各车间、小组、工段大搞技术表演赛，到2日为止各车间有近50％的工人参加了表演。底盘车间在最近两天通过技术表演，推广了七项先进经验；其中两项由全国群英会代表带回的不停车车大圆和不停车打中心孔操作法推广以后，就使车工加工效率普遍提高三倍到四倍。铸工车间职工普遍采用先进的壳形离心浇注法，既加快了进度，又保证了质量。各科室人员也纷纷到车间跟班劳动，帮助车间解决具体问题，保证全面完成今年计划。
