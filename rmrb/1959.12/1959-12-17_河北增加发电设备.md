Hebei Increases Power Generation Equipment

    Recently, power plants in Tangshan, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang and other places in Hebei Province have added a new batch of large-scale generator units with a total capacity of 87,000 kilowatts.

    The expansion projects of these power plants all started between March and April this year. During the construction process, the workers carried out large-scale technical innovations to ensure that the project was completed quickly and well. The workers in charge of the expansion project of Tangshan Power Plant implemented cross-operations of civil engineering and installation, which enabled the first unit to be completed one month ahead of schedule, and the project quality fully met the standards.

    河北增加发电设备
    河北省唐山、天津、石家庄等地发电厂最近新增加了一批大型发电机组，总容量为八万七千瓩。
    这些发电厂的扩建工程都是今年三、四月间动工的。职工们在施工中大搞技术革新，保证工程又快又好。负责唐山发电厂扩建工程的职工，实行了土木建筑和安装交叉作业，使第一机组比计划提前一个月完工，工程质量完全合乎标准。
