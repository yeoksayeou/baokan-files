Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 26th. According to TASS: The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its meeting on the 25th, both in the morning and afternoon, to continue discussing the issue of further developing agriculture.

　　The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a long speech at the afternoon session.

　　After Khrushchev's speech, the plenary session unanimously adopted the corresponding resolution on the issues discussed.

　　Speakers at the morning session included Soviet Minister of Agriculture Matskevich, Academician Lysenko, Fei Kirichenko, a representative from the All-Union Institute of Genetics and Breeding, and Karayev, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Turkmenistan, among others.

　　In his speech, Matskevich pointed out that the collective farms and state farms of the Soviet Union have been strengthened both organizationally and economically. The strengthening of the collective farm economy has made it possible for them to carry out large-scale rural construction in recent years.

　　He emphasized the positive role of collective farms jointly constructing and operating enterprises. He said that the level of development and scope of work of collectively run enterprises raises the issue of establishing institutions to manage these enterprises. He suggested establishing joint collective farm organizations at the district level.

　　Matskevich emphasized that establishing new state farms on wasteland in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union has been fully justified. He said that state farms have greatly increased production.

　　He said that in the past six years, the proportion of grain turned over by state-owned state farms and sold by collective farms to the state has more than doubled, reaching 37.6% in 1959; the proportion of milk and meat has also increased from 17% and 18% respectively to 22% and 24%.

　　Fei Kirichenko, a representative from the All-Union Institute of Genetics and Breeding, said that the Soviet Union has created, for the first time in history, a winter hard wheat suitable for growing in the harsh conditions of the grasslands, in terms of grassland cultivation and breeding. This wheat was given the fine variety name of "Michurin." After experiments over the past three years, "Michurin" can produce 3 to 4 tons of wheat per hectare.

　　Yefremova, a Soviet ordinary peasant woman famous for her excellent organization and leadership of the public economy, aroused great interest among the attendees with her speech at the plenary session. Yefremova is a representative from Ryazan Oblast, and the Kirov Collective Farm she leads sold three and a half times more meat to the state than last year. This farm produced 173 quintals of meat and 346 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land. Karayev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Turkmenistan, said that Turkmenistan plans to increase the production of gray lambskin, which is widely sold on the world market, by at least four times in the next few years. By the end of 1965, there will be an increase of one million lambs, or one-third.

　　Karayev said that during the Seven-Year Plan, ten million hectares of land will be irrigated in the Karakum Desert, which is the best area for developing the lambskin industry.

　　Karayev said that Turkmenistan's cotton production will increase by one-fifth in 1960. The agricultural laborers of this republic have decided to complete the seven-year plan for developing cotton production in six years.

　　At the meeting on the 24th, a total of eighteen people spoke, including: Belshe, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Latvia, Sniečkus, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania, and Demichev, First Secretary of the Moscow Oblast Committee of the CPSU, among others.

　　苏共中央全会继续举行
    通过进一步发展农业的决议
    赫鲁晓夫在会上发表了长篇讲话
    新华社莫斯科26日电　据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议25日上下午继续开会，继续讨论进一步发展农业的问题。
    苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在下午会议上发表了长篇讲话。
    在赫鲁晓夫讲话之后，全会就所讨论的问题一致通过了相应的决议。
    在上午会议上发言的有苏联农业部长马茨凯维奇，李森科院士，全苏遗传育种研究所的代表费·基里钦科和土库曼共产党中央委员会第一书记卡拉耶夫等十人。
    马茨凯维奇在发言中指出，苏联集体农庄和国营农场在组织上和经济上都加强了。集体农庄经济的加强，使它们有可能在最近几年内进行大规模的农村建设。
    他强调指出一些集体农庄联合建设和开办企业的积极作用。他说，集体农庄联合开办企业的发展水平和工作的范围，提出了建立管理这些企业的机构的问题。他建议成立区的集体农庄联合机构。
    马茨凯维奇着重指出，在苏联东部地区的荒地上建立新的国营农场，这个措施已经完全证明是正确的。他说，国营农场大大增加了生产。
    他说，过去六年中，在国家掌握的国营农场上缴和集体农庄交售的粮食总量中，国营农场的比重增加了两倍多，在1959年达到了37.6％；奶类和肉类的比重也分别从17％和18％，增长到22％和24％。
    全苏遗传育种研究所的代表费·基里钦科说，苏联在草原耕作和育种方面有史以来第一次创造了适合在草原的恶劣条件下生长的冬季硬小麦。这种小麦获得了“米丘林号”的良种称号。经过最近三年来的试验，“米丘林号”每公顷能产小麦三十到四十公担。
    以出色地组织和领导公有经济而著名的苏联普通农妇叶弗列莫娃在全体会议上的发言，引起了到会者的巨大兴趣。叶弗列莫娃是梁赞州的代表，她领导的基洛夫集体农庄向国家交售的肉类比去年增加了三倍半。这个农庄的每一百公顷农业用地生产了一百七十三公担肉类和三百四十六公担牛奶。土库曼共产党中央委员会第一书记卡拉耶夫说，土库曼计划在最近几年内将世界市场上销路很广的灰色羔皮的生产至少提高四倍。到1965年年底，羔羊将增加一百万只，即增加三分之一。
    卡拉耶夫说，七年计划期间将在卡拉库姆沙漠灌溉一千万公顷土地，那里是发展羔皮业的最好的地区。
    卡拉耶夫说，土库曼1960年棉花的生产将增加五分之一。这个共和国的农业劳动者决定用六年时间完成发展棉花生产的七年计划。
    在24日的会议上，共有十八人发了言，其中包括：拉脱维亚共产党中央委员会第一书记别尔谢、立陶宛共产党中央委员会第一书记斯涅奇库斯和苏共莫斯科州委第一书记杰米契夫等。
