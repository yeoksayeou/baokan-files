Xinhua News Agency, 15th -- Qi Shifang, a mathematics teacher at Beijing No. 4 Middle School, has achieved an average score of 95 for her students in this year's city-wide and last year's Xicheng District unified mathematics examinations for first-year middle school students.

Since taking on teaching duties in the autumn of 1957, the performance of Qi Shifang's students has consistently been excellent. Her main experiences in teaching are: loving every student, understanding every student, teaching every lesson well, and teaching every student well.

She teaches mathematics to three classes of first-year students, totaling one hundred and fifty students. At the beginning of each new semester, she memorizes the names of the new students and identifies them in class using a seating chart. Through the homeroom teachers, she learns about the students' academic and behavioral performance in elementary school. Later, she uses breaks during teaching to approach and understand the students. She collects every student's homework herself and grades it on the same day. In this way, she gets to know every student within two weeks. After a month or two, she understands each student's learning, thoughts, and family situation.

Based on her love and understanding of the students, Qi Shifang takes various measures to ensure the quality of teaching. Student Rao Jingfu works very hard, but his grades were not good. It turned out that he had been delayed for a year after graduating from elementary school before entering middle school. During this year, he had not learned some of the new knowledge that had been reformed and supplemented in the elementary school mathematics textbook. She immediately took the time to help this student with extra tutoring outside of class to make up for this knowledge, so that he quickly caught up with the class. Student Song Xinlu is a bright and lively boy with a strong understanding, but he is playful and unwilling to do his homework patiently, so his grades are not good. Qi Shifang cooperated with the homeroom teacher, the Young Pioneers organization, and the parents to inspire and cultivate his learning consciousness in many ways. Later, Song Xinlu became more and more interested in doing exercises.

As long as teachers strengthen their sense of responsibility, they can teach every student well. Student Chen Guangcai has weaker calculation skills than the average student, and some people think he is a dull student who cannot keep up with the class. But Qi Shifang has been patiently helping him. In many individual tutoring sessions, she found that this student did not completely not understand what he was learning, but mainly had not clarified some basic concepts. Targeting this weakness, she explained the main problems to him thoroughly, and at the same time cited various types of application problems to allow him to flexibly understand the general rules of the mathematics he was learning. After overcoming the key difficulties, this student's learning situation quickly improved, and finally, in the city-wide unified examination at the end of the term, he obtained an excellent score of 96.

Qi Shifang regards improving the quality of classroom instruction as an important key to improving the quality of teaching. In order to teach every lesson well, she always carefully studies the teaching materials and methods in advance, does a good job of lesson preparation, and clarifies the teaching objectives, key points and difficulties, the most appropriate examples, and the difficult problems that students may raise for each lesson. She has a principle for herself, never pretend to understand what she does not understand, and never teach students wrong or vague concepts. Once, when she was teaching the section on graphs in algebra, she considered in advance that this abstract concept would be difficult for young students to understand. She was not sure how to explain it in a simple and understandable way, so she consulted seven experienced mathematics teachers in a row, until she felt that she was truly confident before going to class.

Two years ago, Qi Shifang was still a housewife. After graduating from the Department of Economics at university in 1945, she stayed at home to manage household affairs and take care of her husband and children. After liberation, seeing that the country's construction was advancing by leaps and bounds, the entire society was progressing, and her relatives and classmates were all working actively, she finally took up a job in 1957. When she first came to No. 4 Middle School, she was very worried that she would not be able to do her job well. The school's Party organization and teachers gave her enthusiastic help, allowing her to study at the Teachers' Continuing Education College, and two experienced and excellent teachers in the school specially gave her individual guidance. The sincere care of the Party organization and the teachers not only allowed her to quickly become familiar with teaching, but also gave her a deep affection for teaching. She worked hard to study her profession and tried every means to improve her teaching level. Her work performance was outstanding, and she has now been selected as an advanced worker in the primary and secondary school system in Xicheng District, Beijing. (Picture attached)

    热爱每个学生　教好每个学生
    漆士芳教学努力学生平均成绩达九十五分
    新华社15日讯　北京市第四中学数学教师漆士芳所教的学生在今年全市和去年西城区举行的中学一年级数学统一考试中，平均成绩达到九十五分。
    漆士芳从1957年秋季担任教学工作以来，所教的学生的成绩一直很好。她在教学上的主要经验是：热爱每个学生，了解每个学生，教好每一节课，教好每个学生。
    她担任一年级三个班一百五十个学生的数学课。每逢新学期开始，她就把新生名单记熟，上课时对照座位表认人，通过班主任摸清这些学生在小学阶段的学习和操行情况，以后又利用教学空隙接近了解学生。学生的作业，她每本都自己收，并且当天批改。这样，两周以内她就认识了每个学生。一两个月以后，她就了解了每个学生的学习、思想和家庭情况。
    在热爱和了解学生的基础上，漆士芳采取了各种办法来保证教学质量。学生饶敬福很用功，可是成绩不好。原来他在小学毕业后耽搁了一年才考上中学。在这一年中，小学数学教材经过改革补充的一些新知识他没有学过。她立即抽出时间帮助这个学生在课外补习了这部分知识，使他很快跟上了班。学生宋心鲁是一个聪明活泼、理解力较强的男孩子，但是贪玩，不肯耐心做功课，成绩不好。漆士芳就和班主任、少先队组织、家长合作，多方面启发培养他的学习自觉性，后来宋心鲁做习题愈做愈感兴趣了。
    只要教师加强责任心，就会教好每一个学生，学生陈广财计算能力比一般学生差，有些人认为他是无法跟上班的笨学生。但是漆士芳一直耐心地帮助他。在多次个别辅导中，她发现这个学生对学的东西并不是完全不懂，主要是没有弄清一些基本概念。针对这个弱点，她就把主要问题给他讲透，同时举出各种类型的应用题让他灵活理解所学数学中的一般规律。在突破困难关键以后，这个学生的学习情况迅速好转了，最后在期终的全市统一考试中，获得了九十六分的优良成绩。
    漆士芳把提高课堂讲授质量作为提高教学质量的重要关键。为了教好每一节课，她总是在事先认真钻研教材教法，做好备课工作，把每节课的教学目的、重点和难点、最恰当的例题、学生可能提出的疑难问题等，都一一琢磨清楚。她自己有一条原则，决不能不懂装懂，决不把错误的或模糊的概念教给学生。有一次她讲到代数中的图象一节，事先考虑到这种抽象的概念很难为年幼的学生理解，怎么讲得深入浅出自己没有把握，就一连请教了七个有经验的数学教师，一直到觉得真正有把握了才去上课。
    两年前，漆士芳还是一个家庭妇女。1945年她在大学经济系毕业后就一直留在家里管理家务，照顾丈夫和孩子。解放后，看到国家建设在突飞猛进，整个社会在进步，自己的亲友同学都在积极工作，终于在1957年她也走上了工作岗位。初来第四中学时，她很耽心做不好工作，学校党组织和教师们给了她热情的帮助，让她到教师进修学院学习，校内两个有经验的优秀教师专门对她进行个别辅导。党组织和教师们的真挚关怀，不但使她迅速熟悉了教学业务，而且对教师工作产生了深厚的感情。她刻苦地钻研业务，千方百计地提高自己的教学水平，工作成绩出色，现在已被评选为北京市西城区中小学系统的先进工作者。（附图片）
