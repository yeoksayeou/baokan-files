　　1960 is Right Before Our Eyes, Don't Delay the Final Sprint
　　One More Lash of the Whip!
　　Wang Dai, Worker in Lanzhou, Gansu
　　Every day I open the newspaper, I see heartening news leaping into view: "A million young workers are marching mightily into 1960!" "The Yang Wanlin Youth Shock Brigade has stepped into 1963!" "Shanghai's young workers launch a general offensive towards 1960!"... Reports of victories, of completing production plans ahead of schedule and in full, of striding ahead of time, and of swiftly entering 1960, fly in from all directions like snowflakes.
　　Marx once said: "All economy ultimately resolves itself into economy of time." To win time is to win victory in all undertakings. After the founding of New China, the primary task facing the people of the whole country was how to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist power in the shortest possible time. Under the correct leadership of the Party, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, the Chinese working class is developing everything rapidly, according to the requirements of high speed. High speed is the inevitable trend of last year's Great Leap Forward and this year's continued Great Leap Forward. High speed fully conforms to the wishes of the people of the whole country to rapidly change the poor and blank state of our national economy.
　　However, the right-leaning opportunists are not satisfied with our high speed. They gesticulate and curse our high speed; they try their best to hold back our progress. The slower we build socialism, the happier they are. They tie themselves to the rear axle of the chariot of the times and shout hoarsely: "Too fast, you are moving too fast! At this rate, won't people be dragged to death? Slow down, the slower the better!" However, they will be wasting their breath even if they shout themselves hoarse! Our high speed of socialist construction will never change because of them! 1960 is coming soon, let us add another lash of the whip, charge forward, and use practical actions to give the right-leaning opportunists a resounding rebuff!

　　"Daredevil's" Words
　　Huo Sen (Huo Sen), Jingnan Mining Area, Zhongliangshan Mining Area, Chongqing
　　In our mine, some people call several outstanding young shock workers "daredevils." These "daredevils" have different work posts and different advanced deeds in production, but they have one thing in common, that is, the "dare" spirit of forging ahead courageously and unstoppably. Under conditions where tools and raw materials are not very abundant, they broke through one difficulty after another; they broke through production quotas one after another. Under the Party's call to strive for high speed, they are now doing the work of 1960, and have already crossed the year-end of 1959.
　　Why were they able to successfully break through? One "daredevil" told me: "Only difficulties are afraid of people, how can people be afraid of difficulties? No matter what the difficulty, big or small, if you are determined to overcome it, there is no reason why you can't overcome it! As long as a person has the determination and drive to overcome the socialist barrier ideologically, then there is nothing that cannot be overcome."
　　These are truly meaningful words. Isn't our Great Leap Forward relying on the guidance of the Party and on the countless daredevils leading everyone to break through? To make our cause develop victoriously, we should constantly examine our own determination and drive. Otherwise, what will we rely on to break through those heavy barriers?
　　There are only twenty-odd days left before 1960. People with great ambitions and those catching up with the advanced, don't be paralyzed and relaxed, add some effort and break through this barrier!

　　Stride
　　Chu Binggeng (Chu Binggeng), PLA stationed in Lushun-Dalian
　　If high speed is compared to a flower in industrial production, then this flower is blooming all over the land, its fragrance wafting across the country. In Lushun-Dalian alone, there are already more than twenty factories and enterprises that have completed their annual output value plans ahead of schedule. Truly: the high tide of the Great Leap Forward surges forward, the red line rises straight up to break through the ninth heaven, 600 million heroes are drumming up their energy, determined to leap forward into 1960.
　　Stride! Stride! Stride! Individuals are striding, collectives are striding, the whole country is striding. The magnificent footsteps of the Great Leap Forward shake the mountains and rivers and resound through the clouds.
　　"Stride" is the revolutionary style, the revolutionary courage, and the glorious tradition of the working class. Those who are conservative, short-sighted, narrow-minded, and afraid of danger and difficulty, dare not even think of this word "stride."
　　"Stride" reflects in a concentrated way the strong desires and great strength of the people of our country. In order to eliminate "poverty and blankness" and win prosperity and strength, the hardworking and brave 600 million Chinese people are fearless, clearing the way through brambles and thorns, overcoming all difficulties, and advancing courageously. If the sky has a handle, they can lift it! If the earth has a ring, they can lift it up.
　　No matter how the gentlemen of Western countries slander and defame; no matter how the right-leaning opportunists injure and oppose, under the guidance of the red flag of the general line, the heroic steps of 600 million people will surely become bigger and bigger, faster and faster, striding mightily into 1960, striding into 1965, striding into 19… and striding into the infinitely bright socialist-communist society.

### 一九六○在眼前  最后冲锋莫迟延

    一九六○在眼前  最后冲锋莫迟延
    再加一鞭！
    甘肃兰州工人  王黛
    每天翻开报纸，总有这些振奋人心的消息跃入眼帘：“百万青工浩浩荡荡地跨入1960年！”“杨万林青年突击队跨入1963年！”“上海青工向1960年展开总攻”……提前全面完成生产计划、大踏步地走在时间前面，飞快地跨入1960年的捷报像雪片似的从四面八方飞来。
    马克思曾经说过：“一切节省，归根到底都归结为时间的节省。”赢得时间，就能取得一切事业的胜利。新中国成立后，摆在全国人民面前的首要任务，是如何在最短的时间内把我国建设成国富民强的社会主义大国。我国工人阶级在党的正确领导之下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，一切都按照高速度的要求，飞快地发展着。高速度，是去年跃进和今年继续跃进的必然趋势。高速度完全符合全国人民要求迅速改变我国国民经济一穷二白的面貌的心愿。
    可是右倾机会主义分子们却不满意我们的高速度。他们指手划脚地咒骂我们的高速度；他们竭力想拖住我们前进的步伐。如果我们建设社会主义的步伐越慢，他们就越高兴。他们把自己系在时代车轮的后轴上声嘶力竭地喊道：“太快了，你们前进得太快了！这样快，岂不要把人拖死吗？慢点吧，越慢越好！”然而他们就是喊破了嗓子也是白费劲！我们建设社会主义的高速度决不会因为他们而有所改变！1960年马上就要到来，让我们再加一鞭，向前猛冲，用实际行动来给右倾机会主义分子一个响亮的回击！
    “闯将”的话
    重庆中梁山矿区井南  霍森
    在我们矿里，有人把几个出色的青年突击手叫做“闯将”。这几个“闯将”的工作岗位不同，在生产上的先进事迹不同，但他们却有共同的一点，就是那股勇往直前，不可阻挡的“闯”劲。在工具、原材料不很充裕的条件下，他们冲破了一重重的难关；接二连三地突破了生产定额，在党的力争高速度的号召下，他们现在已经在做1960年的工作，早已跨过了1959年的年关。
    为什么他们能够胜利地闯关而过呢？一位“闯将”对我谈过：“只有困难怕人，哪有人怕困难的道理？凭它什么难关、大关，居心要过，哪有过不去的道理？一个人只要思想上有过社会主义关的决心和干劲，那就再没有什么过不去的关了。”
    这真是意味深长的话，我们的大跃进，不正是依靠着党的指引，依靠着无数个闯将带动大家闯出来的吗？要使得我们的事业不断胜利地发展，我们就应该时刻检查检查自己的决心和干劲。不然我们将凭什么去闯过那一重重的关呢？
    眼前离1960年只有二十多天了，立大志、赶先进的人们，千万不要麻痹松懈，加一把劲，冲过这个关口吧！
    跨
    解放军驻旅大部队　褚秉耕
    如果把高速度比作工业生产上的花，那末，这花正在遍地开放，香飘全国。仅我们旅大一地，已提前完成今年产值计划的工厂企业就有二十多个。真是：跃进高潮涌向前，红线直升破九天，六亿英雄鼓干劲，决心跃进60年。
    跨！跨！跨！个人在跨，集体在跨，全国在跨。大跃进的雄壮的脚步声震撼山河，响彻云霄。
    “跨”，是革命的风格，革命的胆略，工人阶级的光荣传统。因循守旧，目光短浅，心胸狭窄，畏险惧难的人，连想都不敢想这个“跨”字。
    “跨”，集中地反映了我国人民的强烈愿望和伟大力量。为了消灭“一穷二白”，赢得繁荣富强，勤劳勇敢的六亿中国人民无所畏惧，披荆斩棘，排除万难，勇往直前。天有把，他们举得起！地有环，他们提得起。
    不管西方国家的老爷们怎样诬蔑，怎样毁谤；也不管右倾机会主义者怎样中伤，怎样反对，在总路线红旗的指引下，六万万人的英雄步伐，一定越迈越大，越来越快，浩浩荡荡地跨进1960年，跨进1965年，跨进19……年，跨进无限光明灿烂的社会主义——共产主义社会。
