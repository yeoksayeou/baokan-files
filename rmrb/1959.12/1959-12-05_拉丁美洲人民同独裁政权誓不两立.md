Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd dispatch from Caracas: According to a report in the Venezuelan "El Universal," anti-dictatorial organizations from Nicaragua, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic established the "Alliance of American Peoples Against the Tyrants of Nicaragua, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic" in Caracas in early November, and simultaneously issued the "Declaration of the Alliance of American Peoples Against Tyrants."

This alliance was established to take concerted action in the anti-dictatorial struggle. The alliance declaration stated that the organization will promote the unification of the political, social, and economic forces of the three countries against dictatorship, while promoting the support of the people of various American countries for the anti-dictatorial struggle. The alliance decided to convene a congress to discuss a draft action plan for the alliance. The leadership of the alliance is currently the responsibility of a provisional central committee composed of representatives of the organizations participating in the alliance.

The following signed the alliance declaration: Enrique Lacayo Farfán, leader of the Nicaraguan National Opposition Alliance, and Felipe Augusto Vega, the alliance's representative in Venezuela; Dr. Carlos Pastore, General Rafael Franco, Ricardo Franco, and other members of the Paraguayan Democratic Movement from Paraguay; and Angel Miolan and Americo Lora Camachi, representatives of the Dominican United Liberation Alliance.

    Nicaraguan "Domestic Resistance Front" Formulates Program
    Overthrow the Tyrant and Achieve Democratic Reform

According to the "Central American Nicaraguan Liberation Revolutionary Movement Newsletter" published in early November, the underground organization "Domestic Resistance Front" has been established in Nicaragua. This organization is based on groups of five people, with a designated person in charge. In addition, local leadership committees have been established. These organizations are operating underground. The report said that hundreds of young people have joined the "Domestic Resistance Front," and many groups are composed of women; members of various Nicaraguan opposition parties and patriotic democrats are also participating.

The "Domestic Resistance Front" has formulated a revolutionary program that includes implementing a land policy of distributing land to peasants; improving the living conditions of the working people; implementing trade union freedom; developing Nicaragua's industry; nationalizing national wealth; conducting trade with all countries in the world; abolishing the repressive tools of the dictatorial regime—the current army—and reorganizing it into a people's army.

According to Chester Lacayo, one of the Nicaraguan opposition leaders, who recently told reporters during a visit to the United Nations, there are five columns of armed forces active in the Segovia Mountains in Nicaragua. In early November, due to sabotage by insurgents, the water supply to Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was cut off for fifteen days.

When Chester Lacayo talked about the economic situation in Nicaragua, he pointed out that Nicaragua's industrial production has decreased by 18% in the past three years, and agricultural and livestock production has decreased by 25%. He said, "This is the result of Somoza's tyrannical rule and feudal system."

    Paraguay's Domestic Situation is Deteriorating
    Anti-Dictatorial Struggle Extends at Home and Abroad

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Buenos Aires: According to TASS, the struggle of Paraguayan patriots to overthrow the Stroessner dictatorship and strive for democratic rights and people's freedom has recently intensified. This struggle is not only unfolding domestically but also spreading abroad, especially in Argentina. Hundreds of thousands of Paraguayan citizens have fled here. The intensification of this struggle is due to the continuous deterioration of the situation in Paraguay, the aggravation of hunger and poverty, and the intensification of repressive measures.

Paraguayan priest Talavera said in Buenos Aires that Paraguay is a country where "people have no land, and land has no people." According to materials he provided, 75% of Paraguayan farmers have no land, and they work on other people's fields, but at the same time, eleven companies control more than five million hectares of the best land. Talavera went on to say that the income of the Paraguayan working people is so meager that it cannot even meet one-third of their most basic needs. He emphasized that Paraguay is a "victim of the terrible colonial system advocated by Americans and Britons."

    Representative of Dominican Liberation Movement Declares
    Launch a World Movement to Isolate the Dictator

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Dr. Mejia-Ricart, a member of the Revolutionary Action Committee of the Dominican Liberation Movement, recently told a reporter from the Puerto Rican newspaper "El Mundo" that the Dominican Liberation Movement is organizing a worldwide movement to isolate dictator Trujillo. The current goal of this movement is to have the lowest level of economic, cultural, and political contact between democratic countries and the Dominican Republic. He said that unions are being asked to refuse to load and unload cargo for all ships arriving at Dominican ports, and that the same action is being requested in airlines, banking, wireless telephones, telegraphs, and telephone communications.

Mejia-Ricart said that Dominicans opposing Trujillo have united all their forces and have won the support of many people for their struggle, and they have assumed "major responsibilities." He also said that this is not a simple change of government, but a revolution that will fundamentally change society. He said that in the struggle against Trujillo, exiled Dominicans are united like one person.

    拉丁美洲人民同独裁政权誓不两立
    尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭和多米尼加的反独裁组织
    成立三国反独裁暴君联盟
    新华社3日讯　加拉加斯消息：据委内瑞拉“环球报”报道，尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭和多米尼加三个国家的反独裁组织11月上旬在加拉加斯成立了“美洲人民反对尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭和多米尼加暴君联盟”，同时发表了“美洲人民反对暴君联盟宣言”。
    这个联盟是为了在反独裁的斗争中采取一致行动而建立的。联盟宣言指出，这个组织将促进三国反独裁的政治、社会和经济力量的统一，同时促进美洲各国人民对反独裁斗争的支援。联盟决定召开一次代表大会来讨论联盟的行动计划草案。联盟的领导目前由参加联盟的各组织代表组成的临时中央委员会负责。
    在这个联盟宣言上签字的有：尼加拉瓜全国反对派联盟领袖恩里克·拉卡约·法尔方以及这个联盟驻委内瑞拉代表费利佩·奥古斯托·维加；巴拉圭的卡洛斯·帕斯托雷博士、拉斐尔·佛朗哥将军、理卡多·佛朗哥和巴拉圭民主运动的其他人士；多米尼加统一解放联盟的代表安赫耳·米奥兰和阿梅里科·洛拉·卡马齐。
    尼加拉瓜“国内抵抗阵线”制定纲领
    推翻暴君实现民主改革
    本报讯　据11月初出版的“中美洲尼加拉瓜解放革命运动新闻公报”报道，尼加拉瓜成立了“国内抵抗阵线”的地下组织。这个组织以每五个人为一个小组，指定一个负责人。此外还成立了地方领导委员会。这些组织都是在地下活动的。报道说，几百名青年加入了“国内抵抗阵线”，有很多小组是由妇女组成的；还有尼加拉瓜各反对党的成员和爱国民主人士参加。
    “国内抵抗阵线”制定了革命纲领，这个纲领包括实行把土地分给农民的土地政策；改善劳动人民的生活条件；实行工会自由；发展尼加拉瓜的工业；把民族财富收归国有；同世界各国进行贸易；取消独裁政权的压迫工具——现在的军队，并把它改组成人民的军队。
    据尼加拉瓜反对派领导人之一切斯特·拉卡约不久前在访问联合国时对记者发表谈话说，在尼加拉瓜有五个纵队的武装队伍在塞哥维亚山脉活动。11月初，由于起义者的破坏，使尼加拉瓜首都马那瓜的水源断绝了十五天。
    切斯特·拉卡约在谈到尼加拉瓜的经济情况时指出，尼加拉瓜的工业生产在过去三年来下降了18％，农牧业生产下降了25％。他说，“这是索摩查政权的专横统治和封建制度造成的结果。”
    巴拉圭国内局势日益恶化
    反独裁斗争扩展到国内外
    新华社讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯报道，巴拉圭爱国者推翻斯特罗斯纳独裁制度、争取民主权利和人民自由的斗争近来更加剧烈。这个斗争不仅在国内展开，而且也蔓延到国外，特别是在阿根廷。成千上万的巴拉圭公民流亡到这里。这一斗争的加强是由于巴拉圭局势的不断恶化，由于饥饿、贫困情况的严重化和镇压手段的加强。
    巴拉圭牧师塔拉维拉在布宜诺斯艾利斯说，巴拉圭是一个“人没有土地，土地没有人”的国家。据他提供的材料，巴拉圭75％的农民没有土地，他们在别人的田地上工作，但与此同时，十一家公司却掌握了五百多万公顷最好的土地。塔拉维拉接着说，巴拉圭劳动人民的收入少得可怜，甚至不能满足最基本的需要的三分之一。他强调指出，巴拉圭是“美国人和英国人所提倡的可怕的殖民主义制度下的牺牲品”。
    多米尼加解放运动代表宣告
    发动孤立独裁者的世界运动
    新华社讯　多米尼加解放运动革命行动委员会委员梅希亚—里卡特博士不久前对波多黎各日报“公正报”的记者说，多米尼加解放运动正在组织一个世界规模的运动，以孤立独裁者特鲁希略。这个运动的当前目标是使民主国家和多米尼加共和国之间具有最低水平的经济、文化和政治接触。他说，正在要求各工会拒绝为到达多米尼加港口的一切船只装卸货物，此外也要求在航空公司、银行业务、无线电话、电报和电话通讯各方面采取同样的行动。
    梅希亚—里卡特说，反对特鲁希略的多米尼加人已经团结了一切力量，并且赢得了很多人对他们的斗争的支持，他们已经负起了“重大责任”。他又说，这并不是一个简单的更迭政府的问题，而是一个革命的问题，它将从根本上改变社会。他说，在反对特鲁希略的斗争中，流亡的多米尼加人团结得像一个人一样。
