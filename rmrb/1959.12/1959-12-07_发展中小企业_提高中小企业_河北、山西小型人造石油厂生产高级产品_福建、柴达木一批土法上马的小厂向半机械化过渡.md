Xinhua News Agency report: Hebei Province's small petroleum plants, established during the Great Leap Forward last year, have been reorganized this year and have built a number of simple artificial petroleum plants with annual outputs of 3,000 tons, 1,000 tons, 600 tons, and 300 tons, producing more than 30 kinds of ordinary and high-grade petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and transformer oil.

	In the absence of sufficient equipment, the oil factories in various places have created their own machines. Workers in oil factories in Baoding, Zhuozhou, Chengde, Xinglong, and other places have used large iron drums to make distillation kettles, allowing crude oil to be processed. Many factories have made wooden electric three-layer screening machines and belt conveyors to replace heavy manual labor. Oil factory workers in various places have also continuously improved operating techniques, creating and promoting advanced experiences, so that the province's petroleum extraction rate has generally increased by more than 15 percent, and the dry distillation cycle has been shortened by about 20 hours.

Xinhua News Agency report: Shanxi Province is vigorously developing the coal-to-oil industry in accordance with the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and integrating large, medium, and small enterprises. All cities and twelve counties in the Jinbei Special District have now established coal-to-oil plants. In addition to vigorously running small coal-to-oil factories, the Jin Southeast Special District and Datong City are also concentrating their efforts on building larger coal-to-oil factories.

	Shanxi is rich in coal resources with high oil content. After extracting crude oil from coal, a large amount of semi-coke can still be used as industrial and civilian fuel. The extracted crude oil can be processed into more than ten products such as diesel, gasoline, lubricating oil, kerosene, and by-products such as paraffin and phenols. After comprehensive utilization, the value of one ton of coal can be more than four times higher than before.

Xinhua News Agency report: Fujian Province recently started construction of five enterprises and workshops for manufacturing chemical fertilizers.

	The equipment and raw materials needed for these projects will be solved locally in the province by adapting to local conditions and relying on their own efforts. Some of the non-standard equipment for the synthetic ammonia workshop of the Sanming Chemical Plant is currently being produced by the Sanming Machinery Factory. The Baisha Calcium-Magnesium Phosphate Fertilizer Plant plans to use phosphate rock, serpentine, or dolomite as raw materials, and use the original local iron-smelting earthen blast furnaces, along with some crushers and other equipment, to manufacture calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Qaidam area, which was still a desolate Gobi desert not long ago, now has 28 industries, including coal mining, coking, electricity, machinery, asbestos, mining, chemicals, ceramics, construction, and food, with a total of 194 industrial and mining enterprises above the county level.

	The more than 2,000 products produced by these factories and mines not only timely meet the needs of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production and basic construction in the region, but also vigorously support other regions.

### 发展中小企业　提高中小企业  河北、山西小型人造石油厂生产高级产品  福建、柴达木一批土法上马的小厂向半机械化过渡

    发展中小企业　提高中小企业
    河北、山西小型人造石油厂生产高级产品
    福建、柴达木一批土法上马的小厂向半机械化过渡
    据新华社讯　河北省在去年大跃进中兴办起来的小型石油厂经过今年整顿以后，已经建成一批年产量三千吨、一千吨、六百吨、三百吨的简易人造石油厂，生产出汽油、柴油、煤油、变压器油等三十多种普通和高级石油产品。
    在设备不足的情况下，各地油厂自己动手创造机器。保定、涿县、承德、兴隆等石油厂职工，用大铁桶制成蒸馏釜，使原油得到加工；许多厂制成了木制电动三层筛选机、皮带运输机等，代替了笨重的体力劳动。各地油厂职工还不断改进操作技术，创造和推广了一些先进经验，使全省石油采油率普遍提高了百分之十五以上，干馏周期缩短二十小时左右。
    据新华社讯　山西根据土洋并举、大中小结合的方针，大力发展煤炼油工业。晋北专区一市十二县，现在都已经办起了煤炼油厂。晋东南专区和大同市除了大办煤炼油小型工厂以外，还在集中力量兴建较大的煤炼油工厂。
    山西煤炭资源丰富，含油率高。从煤中提取原油以后，大量半焦仍可供做工业、民用燃料。提取的原油可以加工成柴油、汽油、润滑油、灯油和副产品石腊、酚等十多种产品。一吨煤经过这样综合利用后，价值可以比原来提高四倍多。
    据新华社讯　福建省最近动工兴建五个制造化肥的企业和车间。
    这些工程所需要的设备和原料，都将在省内因地制宜自力更生地解决。三明化工厂合成氨车间的部分非标准设备，目前正在三明机器厂生产。白沙钙镁磷肥厂准备以磷矿石、蛇纹石或白云石作原料，利用当地原有炼铁土高炉，再配备部分破碎机等设备，制造钙镁磷肥。
    据新华社讯　不久以前还是一片戈壁荒滩的柴达木地区，现在已经出现了采煤、炼焦、电力、机械、石棉、采矿、化工、陶瓷、建筑、食品等二十八个行业，共有县级以上的厂矿企业一百九十四个。
    这些厂矿现在所生产的两千多种产品，不仅适时地供应了本地区工、农、牧业生产和基本建设的需要，还有力地支援了外地。（附图片）
