Cixi Eliminates Cotton Bollworm
    County Cotton Warehouses Have Been Cleaned Once
    (Reported by our newspaper) While rushing to pick and sell cotton, Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, is seizing the favorable opportunity to eliminate the main pest that seriously harms cotton production – the bollworm.
    Under the battle cry of "Eliminate every worm, don't let a single one overwinter," the communes in the county are vigorously eliminating pests. Since the beginning of harvesting new cotton in mid-August, the Miaoxi Production Team of Wudongzha Commune has had more than two hundred female commune members catching bollworms in warehouses and drying grounds every day, and picking rotten bolls and diseased cotton bolls in the fields. As of November 9, all cotton warehouses in the county had been thoroughly cleaned once. More than 7,600 warehouses equipped with bollworm killing devices had eliminated more than 67,000 jin of bollworms.
    In the work of eliminating overwintering bollworms, the Cixi County Committee of the Communist Party of China strengthened its leadership over this work, established pest control organizations from the county to the production team level, provided specialized leadership, and followed through to the end. The Party committees of each commune conducted specialized research and clarified division of labor. Various localities also overcame various ideological obstacles through on-site meetings, large-scale debates, recollection and comparison, and detailed accounting. The members of the Miaoxi Production Team recalled the fact that the vigorous pest control last year greatly reduced the rate of damage to green bolls in the fields this year, which explained the effectiveness of pest control, made the members realize the importance of pest control, and overcame complacency. As the young commune member Chen Fangqin said: "Accounting is really alarming, we must eliminate all pests."
    Each commune promptly summarized pest control experience, established model pacesetters, and launched a pest control competition between communes and teams. After Wudongzha Commune put forward a pest control proposal to the entire county, Simen, Changhe, Longshan, Xiaolin and other communes immediately responded. Simen Commune, which had done a better job in pest control, mobilized the masses, summarized last year's experience, and adopted methods such as prevention (establishing pest control equipment), water (soaking), fire (burning), and picking (picking all rotten bolls) to comprehensively encircle and suppress the pests. Now the entire commune has eliminated more than 15,000 jin of pests and picked more than 280,000 rotten bolls. (Cixi County Committee Office Correspondence Group)

    慈溪除治棉花红铃虫
    全县棉仓已清理一遍
    本报讯　浙江慈溪县在突击采棉和售棉的同时，抓住有利时机，扑灭严重危害棉花生产的主要害虫——红铃虫。
    这县各公社在“见虫就除，不让一条越冬”的战斗口号鼓舞下，大力扑灭虫害。五洞闸公社庙西生产队自8月中旬开始收摘新棉到现在，每天都有二百多个女社员在仓库、晒场捕杀红铃虫，在田间摘烂桃僵铃。到11月9日止，全县所有的棉花仓库都进行了一次彻底清理，已装置捕杀设备的七千六百多间仓房，扑灭了红铃虫六万七千多斤。
    在除治越冬红铃虫工作中，中共慈溪县委加强了对这一工作的领导，从县到生产队层层建立了除虫组织，专线领导，一抓到底。各公社党委都作了专门研究，明确分工。各地还通过现场会、大辩论、回忆对比、算细账等办法，克服了各种思想障碍。庙西生产队的社员回忆去年大力除虫，今年田间青铃危害率大大下降的事实，说明治虫的效果，使社员认识到除虫的重要性，克服了麻痹思想。如青年社员陈方琴说：“算了账真惊人，一定要除清虫害。”
    各公社及时总结除虫经验，大树标兵，开展了社与社、队与队之间的除虫竞赛。五洞闸公社向全县提出了除虫倡议之后，泗门、长河、龙山、逍林等公社立即响应。原来除虫搞得比较好的泗门公社，发动群众，总结了去年的经验，采取了防（建立除虫设备）、水（浸）、火（烧）、摘（烂桃摘光）等办法，全面围剿，现在全社已除虫一万五千多斤，摘烂桃二十八万多斤。　　（慈溪县委办公室通讯组）
