Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest 电: Romanian agricultural laborers are actively carrying out various preparatory tasks in order to strive for a bumper harvest next year.

At present, the plowing work for the land for spring planting next year is nearing completion nationwide. As of December 3, a total of 3.65 million hectares of land had been plowed nationwide, completing 91% of the entire plowing plan. Collective farms have completed 98% of the plowing plan.

This year, state farms and machine tractor stations generally deep-plowed the land they cultivated to a depth of 30 to 40 centimeters. It is estimated that by the end of the year, 11,000 hectares of land used for planting grapes and saplings will be deep-plowed to a depth of 70 centimeters to 1 meter.

In recent years, Romanian peasants have not only paid attention to deep plowing, but have also paid special attention to fertilizing the land. Last autumn, 7.7 million tons of organic fertilizer were applied, and this year, more than 8 million tons of organic fertilizer had been applied by mid-November. This autumn, the amount of chemical fertilizer applied was about 40% higher than last year. (Attached picture)

In the past, collective farmers in Seria village, Romania, used cattle to cultivate the land. Now they are using tractors.

    罗马尼亚农民抓紧增产措施
    明年春播土地耕得深施肥多
    新华社布加勒斯特电　罗马尼亚农业劳动者积极进行各种准备工作，争取明年的丰收。
    目前，全国供明年春播的土地的翻耕工作已经接近完成。到12月3日为止，全国已经耕完三百六十五万公顷土地，完成了全部耕地计划的91％。集体农庄已经完成了耕地计划的98％。
    今年国营农场和机器拖拉机站代耕的土地一般都深耕三十到四十公分。预计，到年底将有一万一千公顷用来栽种葡萄和树苗的土地，深翻七十公分到一米。
    近年来，罗马尼亚农民不但注意土地的深耕工作，而且也特别注意对土地施肥的工作。去年秋耕施的有机肥料达七百七十万吨，今年到11月中旬已施了有机肥料八百多万吨。今年秋耕所施的化学肥料比去年增加40％左右。（附图片）
    罗马尼亚塞尔亚村的集体农民过去耕地都用牛，现在用上拖拉机了。
