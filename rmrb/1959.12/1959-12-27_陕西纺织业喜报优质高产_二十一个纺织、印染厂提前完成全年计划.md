　　陕西纺织业喜报优质高产
    二十一个纺织、印染厂提前完成全年计划
    本报讯　陕西省纺织工业管理局所属企业中的二十一个纺织、印染厂，截至20日已经提前全面完成了全年总产值、产量、质量、降低成本、利润、劳动生产率计划。这二十一个厂是：西北国棉一厂、西北国棉二厂、西北国棉三厂、西北国棉四厂、西北国棉六厂、西北国棉七厂筹建处、西安纺织厂、陕西第一棉纺织厂、陕西第二棉纺厂、新秦纺织厂、大华纺织厂、新西北印染厂、黄河棉织厂、大兴织造厂、西安针织厂筹建处、西安帆布厂、西安织布一厂、西安织布二厂、西安织布三厂、西安织布五厂、新中染整厂。这些纺织、印染厂还新增加了两千多种花色品种，如“长安十二景”花布、丝光床单、粘胶人造纤维咔叽等。
    今年以来，纺织工业各厂的党委都大抓小组工作，大抓提高操作技术，发动群众深入开展比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的竞赛。在中共陕西省委发出学习和追赶陈俊德、曹桂芳、康义隆三个标兵小组的指示以后，各厂都更加重视总结小组经验，层层树立标兵，带动大家赶先进。如新秦纺织厂树立了四个标兵组，三十名先进生产者为厂级标兵，开展竞赛，很快就有六十九个小组和一百四十个工人赶上标兵水平。陕西第二棉纺厂结合竞赛开展技术练兵，90％的小组都能按期完成国家计划。
