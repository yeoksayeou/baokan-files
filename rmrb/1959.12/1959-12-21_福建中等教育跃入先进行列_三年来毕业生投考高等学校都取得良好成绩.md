Fujian Secondary Education Leaps into the Advanced Ranks
Graduates Have Achieved Excellent Results in College Entrance Exams for the Past Three Years

(Our dispatch) Fuzhou – Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the Party's educational policy, Fujian Province, where secondary education had a relatively weak foundation, has seen its educational quality leap to the forefront of the country. Since 1957, the province's graduates have consistently achieved some of the best results in college entrance examinations. This year, over 70% of secondary schools across the province have an average score at or above the passing level, and over two-thirds of schools have improved their average score by more than 20 points compared to 1954.

Fujian Province's initial conditions for education were relatively poor. In the early days of liberation, the province had 209 middle schools with over 106,000 students and 2,900 teachers. However, the vast majority of schools suffered from insufficient teachers, low quality, and poor teaching equipment. Currently, the province has 416 full-time middle schools with 240,000 students, more than four times the number in 1949. The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Party committees at all levels attach great importance to secondary education. In recent years, they have transferred a large number of cadres who have been tempered in revolutionary struggles to schools to take on leadership roles. Party committees at all levels place great emphasis on developing Party organizations in schools. Currently, 10% of teachers are Communist Party members, and all state-run full-time middle schools have established Party branches with Party member leading cadres, which powerfully guarantees the Party's leadership over school work.

Starting in 1957, Fujian Province organized teachers and students in secondary schools to earnestly study the Party's educational policy and launched a large-scale socialist education movement centered on the educational policy. Through airing views and debates, the political consciousness of teachers and students was raised. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, secondary schools established many small factories and farms, and teachers and students participated in labor, closely integrating education with productive labor. This overcame the tendency of some schools to be detached from production, reality, and politics, rapidly establishing a new teaching order and enriching teaching content, pushing secondary education in the province to a new stage. After this series of efforts, the originally advanced schools became even more advanced, and some middle schools in mountainous areas with weak foundations also caught up, forming a new situation of comprehensive advancement in school education.

In the process of improving teaching quality, Party organizations in schools in Fujian Province have paid attention to strengthening the political and ideological work of teachers, deeply leading teaching, and giving full play to the enthusiasm of teachers. The method of deeply leading teaching by the Party organization in schools is, first of all, to grasp the unified teaching plan and the organizational arrangements for school work. While grasping teaching work, many Party branch secretaries and committee members have earnestly studied one or two courses and taken on the teaching work of major courses. At the same time, with the teaching and research group as the center, teachers are organized to deeply study teaching materials, carefully prepare lessons, and promptly help solve problems. Many teachers, with the help and impetus of the Party branch, have also changed the past phenomenon of only taking care of classroom teaching, ignoring students' extracurricular activities, and not caring about the quality of review, establishing the idea of "managing both teaching and people."

In the teaching process, schools pay special attention to the review and consolidation of learned knowledge. There is regular review and checking during normal classes, review of chapters and topics, review every half or full semester, review combining the explanation of new lessons with the review of old lessons, and assigning students to conduct independent review outside of class, etc. Through repeated review, students can better understand knowledge. Party organizations in schools also attach great importance to adjusting teacher-student relationships. On the one hand, they respect and support teachers in earnestly exercising their teaching authority and giving play to the leading role of teachers. On the other hand, they pay attention to encouraging students' enthusiasm for learning, collecting students' opinions, and helping teachers continuously improve teaching and improve quality.

Currently, middle schools throughout the province are deeply studying and implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting, comprehensively conducting a mid-term work inspection centered on checking teaching quality, and striving to achieve greater results next year.

　　福建中等教育跃入先进行列
    三年来毕业生投考高等学校都取得良好成绩
    本报讯　原来中等教育基础比较薄弱的福建省，在党的建设社会主义总路线和党的教育方针光辉照耀下，教育质量跃居全国先进行列。从1957年以来，该省各届毕业生投考高等学校考试都是最好的省份之一，今年全省70％以上的中等学校平均成绩都在及格水平以上，三分之二以上的学校平均成绩比1954年提高了二十分以上。
    福建省教育工作的原有条件比较差。在解放初期，全省有中学二百零九所，学生十万六千多名，教师二千九百名，但是绝大多数学校的师资不足、质量不高，教学设备差。目前全省全日制中学已达四百一十六所，在校学生二十四万人，比1949年增加四倍多。中共福建省委和各级党委对中学教育工作都很重视，几年来抽调大批经过革命斗争锻炼的干部到学校去担任领导工作，各级党委很重视发展学校的党组织，目前教师中有10％是共产党员，国家办的全日制中学都建立了党支部，都有了党员领导干部，有力地保证了党对学校工作的领导。
    从1957年起，福建省组织各中等学校广大师生认真学习党的教育方针，开展了以教育方针为中心的大规模的社会主义教育运动，通过鸣放辩论，提高了广大师生的政治觉悟。1958年大跃进中，各中等学校创办了许多小型工厂、农场、广大师生参加了劳动，使教育和生产劳动紧密结合起来，克服了一些学校脱离生产、脱离实际、脱离政治的倾向，迅速建立了新的教学秩序，丰富了教学内容，把全省中等学校教育工作推向新的阶段。经过这一系列的工作以后，原来先进的学校更先进了，原来基础薄弱的一些山区的中学，也赶上来了，形成学校教育全面跃进的新局面。
    福建省在提高教学质量的过程中，各学校党组织都注意加强教师的政治思想工作，深入领导教学，充分发挥教师的积极性。学校党组织深入领导教学的办法，首先是抓统一的教学计划，抓学校工作的组织安排。在抓好教学工作中，许多学校的党支部书记、支委都分别认真钻研一二门课程，担任主要课程的教学工作。同时以教研组为中心，组织教师深入钻研教材，认真备课，发现问题及时帮助解决。许多教师在党支部的帮助和带动下，也改变了过去只管课堂教学、不管学生课外活动、不管复习好坏的现象，树立了“管教又管人”的思想。
    各学校在教学过程中特别重视对已学知识的复习巩固工作，有平时上课的经常的检查复习，有章节和课题的复习，有半学期一学期的复习，有结合新课的讲解联系旧课的复习，有布置学生在课外进行独立的复习等等，通过反复的复习，使学生更好地理解知识。各学校党组织也很重视调整师生关系，一方面尊重和支持教师认真执行在教学上的职权，发挥教师的主导作用，另一方面又注意鼓舞学生的学习积极性，收集学生的意见，帮助教师不断地改进教学，提高质量。
    现在全省各中学正在深入学习和贯彻党的八届八中全会决议、省委扩大会议精神，全面进行以检查教学质量为中心的期中工作大检查，争取明年取得更大成绩。（附图片）
