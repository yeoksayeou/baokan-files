Listen, our brothers!
Ten thousand peacocks fly into Beijing city,
Clusters of colorful clouds surround Tiananmen,
Phoenixes sing in the clouds,
The sun smiles round and round.
Flowers everywhere welcome the sun,
Pick the most fragrant glutinous golden flower,
Offer it to the respected Communist Party,
Sing a song from the bottom of our hearts,
Praising our beloved Communist Party,
Thousands of families raise all their wine bowls,
Wishing our benefactor Chairman Mao boundless longevity.
Sing! Zanha! Sing to your heart's content,
Wake up the earth with your singing,
Light up the forests,
Let the whole world hear our singing.
(Note): Zanha is a folk singer of the Dai ethnic group.

    赞哈的歌〔注〕
    傣族歌手　康朗甩听吧！我们的兄弟！万只孔雀飞进北京城，朵朵彩云绕着天安门，凤凰在云端里歌唱，太阳笑得团团转。遍地鲜花迎太阳，摘一朵最香的糯金花，献给敬爱的共产党，唱一只心底的歌，歌颂我们敬爱的共产党，千家万户举起所有的酒碗，祝恩人毛主席万寿无疆。唱吧！赞哈！尽情的歌唱吧，把大地唱醒，把森林唱亮，让全世界都听到我们歌唱。
  （注）：赞哈系傣族民间歌手
