Is it possible to carry out spare-time cultural education in a collective labor site of several thousand people? Can it be done well? The Gangnan Reservoir in Hebei Province provides a positive answer with facts. While achieving great success in constructing the reservoir project, all the builders of the reservoir have also achieved significant results in cultural learning. Currently, 30,314 people across the entire construction site have graduated from literacy classes and advanced to spare-time elementary school classes, with 10,216 people reaching the level of upper elementary school.

Not long after the reservoir project began, the CCP Gangnan Reservoir Committee established a spare-time cultural education headquarters. Party organizations at all levels included spare-time cultural education on the Party's agenda, and the quality of workers' learning was used as a criterion for evaluating advanced producers.

However, at the beginning of the spare-time cultural education work for the workers, there were different views and debates. Some people believed that the labor on the construction site was too intense, and spare-time education could not be carried out; some cadres believed that failing to complete production tasks was unacceptable, and whether cultural learning was carried out was irrelevant. Faced with this situation, the CCP Gangnan Reservoir Committee organized all workers and cadres to engage in a major debate. During the debate, everyone carefully analyzed the situation on the reservoir construction site, believing that while production on the reservoir construction site was indeed intense, there were many young and middle-aged people who were actively working and eager to learn; production on the reservoir construction site was concentrated, and working hours were unified, making it easy to organize learning. As long as leadership was strengthened and time was properly arranged, it would definitely be possible to learn well. After extensive debate, ideological understanding was unified, and a mass spare-time learning movement was rapidly launched with leadership and organization.

In order to impound and store floodwater ahead of schedule during the flood season this year, each construction unit changed from three shifts to two shifts, and working hours increased, relatively reducing spare time. How to ensure that spare-time learning continued became an important issue. At this time, the Reservoir Party Committee promptly discovered and summarized the "Four Follows and Four Goes" learning experience of Shenxian, Gaocheng, Hengshui and other construction camps, namely: learning follows production, teachers follow students, books follow workers, and classrooms follow the construction site. These experiences properly resolved the contradiction between learning and production. The Reservoir Party Committee convened an on-site meeting and promptly promoted this experience. When implementing this method, each construction camp created many learning formats that were integrated with production, based on the characteristics of their own unit. For example, the Hengshui construction camp created new methods of "Four Squeezes" (squeezing time before and after meals, before and after meetings, before and after work, and during production breaks for learning) and "Five Grasps" (grasping rest time in the morning and afternoon, grasping rest time between night and day shifts, grasping time when meetings are not held, grasping time for assembling and walking, and grasping time for learning the technology related to the work being done). Because the learning formats adapted to the characteristics of construction site production, learning was not interrupted even during the most intense labor days.

Due to the development of spare-time education, the cultural level of the vast number of workers has been raised, which has also promoted the progress of the reservoir project. In more than a year, workers have put forward more than 7,700 major innovation proposals, and production efficiency has increased several times; at the same time, more than 4,800 workers have become technical personnel through learning culture and technology, mastering 43 kinds of technologies such as earthwork machinery, belt transportation, drilling, electrical engineering, and transportation.

### 挤时间抓空隙　学习跟着生产走  岗南水库民工创造许多学习方法

    挤时间抓空隙　学习跟着生产走
    岗南水库民工创造许多学习方法
    本报讯　在几万人集体劳动的工地上能不能开展业余文化教育？能不能开展得好？河北省岗南水库用事实作了肯定的回答。水库的全体建设者在修建水库工程取得巨大成绩的同时，文化学习也获得了显著成绩。目前，全工地已经有三万零三百一十四人在扫盲班结业，升入了业余初小班，一万零二百十六人达到高小水平。
    水库工程开始不久，中共岗南水库党委就建立了业余文化教育指挥部，各级党组织把业余文化教育列入了党的议事日程，民工学习好坏列为评选先进生产者的条件。
    但是在民工业余文化教育工作刚开始的时候，曾有过不同的看法和争论。有些人认为工地劳动紧张，业余教育搞不起来；有些干部认为：生产任务完不成交代不过去，文化学习搞不搞没关系。面对着这种情况，中共岗南水库委员会组织全体民工和干部进行了大辩论。在辩论中，大家认真分析了水库工地的形势，认为水库工地生产是紧张，但是青壮年多，他们劳动积极，迫切要求学习；水库工地生产集中，劳动时间统一，容易组织学习，只要加强领导，妥善安排时间，一定能够学好。经过大争大辩，统一了思想认识，群众性的业余学习运动就有领导、有组织地迅速开展起来。
    为了提前在今年汛期拦洪蓄水，各施工单位都由三班改成两班，工作时间增加，业余时间相对减少，如何使业余学习坚持下去，成了一个重要问题。这时水库党委及时发现总结了深县、藁城、衡水等施工营的“四跟四走”的学习经验，即：学习跟着生产走，教师跟着学生走，书本跟着民工走，课堂跟着工地走。这些经验妥善地解决了学习和生产的矛盾。水库党委召开了现场会议，及时推广了这个经验。各施工营实行这一办法时，又根据本单位的特点，创造了许多结合生产的学习形式。如衡水施工营创造了“四挤”（挤饭前饭后，会前会后，上工前下工后，生产间歇时间学习）、“五抓”（抓上、下午休息时间，抓夜班白班的休息时间，抓不开会的时间，抓整队和走路的时间，抓做啥工学啥技术的时间）的新方法。由于学习形式适应工地生产的特点，即使在劳动最紧张的日子里，学习也没有间断。
    由于业余教育的开展，提高了广大民工的文化水平，也促进了水库工程的进度。在一年多的时间内，民工们提出较大的革新建议七千七百多项，生产效率成倍增加；同时还有四千八百多名民工通过学习文化、技术成了技术人员，分别掌握了土方机械、皮带运输、钻探、电工、交通运输等四十三种技术。
