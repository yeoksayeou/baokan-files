    Reform Feeding Tools to Raise More Pigs and Save Labor
    Wujiapo Management Area, One Person Feeds Nearly 100 Pigs, Achieving Labor and Leisure
    (Our report) The Wujiapo Management Area of Chengguan People's Commune in Fushan County, Shanxi Province, mobilized the masses to reform tools and used a large number of simple machines in the process of raising pigs. The number of pigs fed by each feeder has increased from 20 to nearly 100, greatly promoting the development of pig raising.
    There are 300 households in Wujiapo, raising 4,612 pigs, of which 85% are collectively raised, with 260 laborers responsible for feeding. Recently, when the Party branch of this management area further studied the plan for developing pig raising, it calculated that, based on the current feeding efficiency, the number of feeders would need to be increased to 500. The entire management area has a total of 410 laborers, which would not be enough even if all of them were invested in pig raising. The Party organization of the management area felt that if the current manual operation situation was not changed quickly, the pig raising industry could not develop faster. At the same time, the excessive occupation of labor by pig raising would inevitably affect agricultural production and other production. The solution to this contradiction was to mobilize the masses and engage in large-scale tool reforms.
    Initially, some people with right-leaning conservative ideas did not agree with tool reforms. They said, "It costs too much money and doesn't do any good, just a waste of manpower, material resources, and financial resources." In order to completely solve these ideological problems, the Party branch organized the commune members to launch a great airing of views, a great contending, and a great debate. At the same time, they organized commune members to visit the mechanical paper-making process of the Fushan County Paper Mill, so that the commune members recognized that only by widely adopting simple machines can the further development of the pig raising industry be guaranteed and the labor contradiction between agriculture and animal husbandry be effectively resolved.
    In the reform of feeding tools, the secretary took personal command, absorbed four skilled craftsmen to form a technical guidance group, and extracted some commune members to form a shock team. The two idle diesel engines and one locomotive boiler were used as power. Adhering to the principles of making use of simple resources, self-reliance, and using local materials, they created things themselves. In this way, they tried every means to solve the difficulties of insufficient technical strength and lack of funds and equipment. The commune members fought continuously for seven days and made feeding simple and mechanized.
    The commune members of the Wujiapo Management Area have now established a pig feed processing plant, installed two diesel engines, one locomotive boiler, one steel mill, and one straw cutter. The crushing of pig feed has been changed from animal power to simple mechanical operation. The commune members have also made many improvements to the pig feeding process, connecting the feed processing and pig feeding processes to form an automatic assembly line system. In the past, feed processing alone required sixty people and twenty livestock to work day and night, and the processed feed was very rough. Now, using mechanical processing saves labor and the feed is more delicate. Currently, a total of 67 laborers are used for pig raising in the area, a reduction of 193 people compared to before the simplification and mechanization.
    The quality of feeding has also been greatly improved. In the past, pigs were unwilling to eat corn stalks, cotton boll shells, and other feeds that were chopped with a knife. Now, they are finely crushed with stone mills and stone rollers, and then water and heat are added to make them into a pasty, high-quality feed. After inspection by technicians, pigs can easily digest this feed.

    改革饲养工具多养猪省劳力
    吴家坡管理区一人喂猪近百头做到有劳有逸
    本报讯　山西省浮山县城关公社吴家坡管理区，发动群众改革工具，在养猪过程中大量使用简易机械，饲养员由过去每人喂二十头猪提高到近百头，大大推动了养猪事业的发展。
    吴家坡有三百户人家，养猪四千六百一十二头，其中公养的占85％，用二百六十个劳力负责饲养。最近这个管理区的党支部在进一步研究发展养猪规划时，按照现在的饲养工效计算，饲养员需要增加到五百个。全管区共四百一十个劳力，全部投到养猪事业都不够。管理区党组织感到要不迅速改变手工操作的现状，养猪事业就不能更快发展；同时，养猪占用劳力过多，必然会影响到农业生产和其他生产。而解决这个矛盾的办法就是发动群众，大搞工具改革。
    最初，一部分有右倾保守思想的人不赞同搞工具改革，他们说：“花钱多不顶事，白白浪费人力物力和财力。”党支部为了彻底解决这些思想问题，一方面组织社员展开了大鸣大放大辩论；一方面又组织社员参观了浮山县造纸厂机械造纸操作过程，使社员认清了目前只有广泛采用简易机械，才能保证养猪事业的进一步发展，有效解决农牧业之间的劳力矛盾。
    在改革饲养工具中，书记亲自挂帅，吸收了四名能工巧匠组成了技术指导小组，抽出一部分社员组成突击队，并把闲置的两部柴油机、一个锅驼机用来作为动力，本着因陋就简、自力更生、就地取材的原则，自己动手创造。就这样千方百计地解决了技术力量不足，资金设备缺乏的困难。社员们连续奋战了七天，就使喂养简易机械化。
    吴家坡管理区社员们现在已建立了一座猪食加工厂，安了两部柴油机，一部锅驼机，一部钢磨和一部铡草机。猪饲料的粉碎工作由畜力改用简易机械操作。社员们又对喂猪过程作了许多改进，使饲料加工和喂猪过程连接起来，形成一套自动的流水作业系统。从前光饲料加工就得六十个人和二十头牲口日夜忙碌，而且加工的饲料很粗糙，如今用机械加工，既省人力，饲料又细致。现在全区共使用六十七个劳力养猪，比简易机械化以前减少了一百九十三人。
    饲养质量也大大提高。过去玉米秆、棉桃壳等饲料用铡刀铡的猪不肯吃，现在用石磨和石碾粉碎得很细，又经过加水加热，变成糊状的优质饲料。经过技术人员检验，猪吃了这种饲料很容易消化。
