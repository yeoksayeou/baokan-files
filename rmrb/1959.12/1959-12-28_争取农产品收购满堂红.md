This year's agricultural product procurement work has been done very well. Thanks to the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels, the active efforts of all financial and trade department employees, grassroots cadres, and all peasant masses, the progress of agricultural product procurement has been faster than in any previous year, and great achievements have already been made. The vast majority of provinces and regions have completed and overfulfilled their grain requisition tasks. The national tea and flue-cured tobacco procurement tasks have been overfulfilled. Significant progress has also been made in the procurement of cotton, edible oil, and other major agricultural products. This year, a nationwide "small autumn harvest" campaign was widely launched, and the procurement of wild plant raw materials has greatly increased compared to last year. By the end of November, the state's procurement of wild fibers had increased by about two times compared to the same period last year, wild starch raw materials increased by more than one and a half times, wild oilseeds increased by about two times, and wild tanning materials increased by about four times. While vigorously carrying out agricultural product procurement, Party committees at all levels have paid attention to the internal distribution of agricultural products within the people's communes, and have paid attention to the production arrangements of the communes and production teams and the living arrangements of the members. All of this fully proves the great achievements of agricultural production in 1959, proves the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes not only in production but also in living arrangements and procurement, and proves that the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party played a huge role in ensuring the continued leap forward in 1959.

Now the agricultural product procurement work has entered its later stages. Although the progress of agricultural product procurement is generally fast, the procurement tasks for some varieties, such as cotton, edible oil, and hemp, have not been fully completed. We must advance victoriously, do our work more thoroughly and meticulously, complete and overfulfill the procurement tasks for cotton, edible oil, hemp, and other agricultural products, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the agricultural product procurement work, ensuring that the agricultural product procurement movement starts and ends well.

In the later stages of the procurement work, although the quantity of agricultural products that need to be procured seems to be relatively small, it is still necessary to work hard to complete them. This is because: First, the main force of current rural work, including the leadership and the vast majority of the labor force, has shifted to production and construction movements such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and production, soil improvement, deep plowing and deep turning, and winter field management. Second, the agricultural products that have not yet been procured are generally more scattered and fragmented, and many are still on the stalks not yet picked or threshed. It takes more effort to harvest and procure these things than during the peak period of agricultural product harvesting and procurement. Third, in the later stages, cadres and the masses are prone to slackness and to neglecting the importance of scattered and fragmented agricultural products, and are prone to perfunctoriness and a loosening up after the initial push. All of this shows that to do a good job in the later stages of agricultural product procurement, we must continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost enthusiasm, adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to the mass line, adhere to handling matters in accordance with policies, and we must better coordinate and comprehensively arrange all tasks under the condition of subordinating to the central work of the countryside; we must intersperse the procurement work throughout the entire rural winter production and construction movement, making the procurement work more in-depth, more meticulous, and more down-to-earth.

According to materials reflected by various localities, there are still some agricultural products that should be procured but have not been procured in many areas. Some production teams, production brigades, and commune members still have some agricultural products that should be sold. Some cotton stalks still have cotton bolls that have not been picked, or have been picked but not opened. Thoroughly harvesting these unharvested fruits of labor will not only help to complete the state's procurement tasks and increase social wealth, but also increase the income of communes and production teams. The key to the problem lies in the Party committees at all levels continuing to strengthen their leadership over the harvesting and procurement work, and effectively solving the ideological problems existing among cadres and the masses. The experience of various localities this year once again proves that whether the later stages of agricultural product procurement can be done thoroughly depends on whether the later stages of procurement work continue to be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and whether the leadership, labor, and transportation necessary to complete the agricultural product procurement tasks are arranged in a unified manner; it depends on the Party committee continuing to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the procurement movement in the later stages, and whether it can effectively solve the ideological problems among cadres and the masses. The cadres of the Wangtaigou Brigade of the Daxinzhuang Commune in Penglai County, Shandong Province, originally believed that the procurement task of 430,000 jin of peanut kernels allocated to them could not be completed, but the commune Party committee, under the direct leadership of the county Party committee, effectively strengthened organizational leadership and ideological leadership. The cadres and the masses were in high spirits and full of enthusiasm. After a few days of concentrated effort, they procured 520,000 jin, overfulfilling the procurement task. This is a very vivid example, and such examples are everywhere. However, there are still individual grassroots units where the later stages of procurement work were not carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and the forces were not unified and deployed. Only some personnel from the business departments were carrying it out independently, resulting in slow progress in the procurement work. Therefore, this issue must be taken seriously.

To do a good job in the later stages of agricultural product procurement and quickly complete the procurement tasks, it is also necessary to launch mass short-term shock movements. Currently, the entire rural work is centered on farmland water conservancy and winter production. At this time, the mass movement for procurement work should take the form of short-term shock efforts. Especially for those varieties and regions, communes, and production teams where the procurement tasks have not been well completed but the actual situation is completely capable of completing them, we should, on the basis of effectively solving ideological problems, and under the conditions of strengthening leadership and overall planning, squeeze out manpower, squeeze out time, select the right time, and mobilize the masses to launch one or several short-term shock efforts. This is the most effective way to complete and overfulfill the later stages of agricultural product procurement tasks.

This year, as in previous years, various localities have correctly implemented the state's agricultural product procurement policies, ensuring the smooth progress of agricultural product procurement work in the previous period. Now that we have entered the later stages, various localities must continue to implement state policies. Agricultural products that should be procured must be resolutely procured, and those that should be retained by the communes, production teams, and commune members must be resolutely retained. The practical problems existing in the procurement work should be solved realistically in accordance with the policies. In terms of grain, regions that have not completed their tasks must continue to complete them. The grain that should be retained for the communes and production teams must be retained in accordance with state policies. More importantly, we must continue to do a good job in the internal grain distribution work of the people's communes and arrange the lives of the commune members. For cotton and edible oil, sufficient amounts should be retained according to the standards stipulated by the state, and all other products that should be procured must be procured. Those who can overfulfill the task must resolutely overfulfill it. Other agricultural, sideline, and native specialty products are rarely retained by the communes and production teams. In addition to those that should be retained in accordance with state policies, the commercial portion should be sold to the state in its entirety. In short, under the condition of appropriately arranging the proportion of the commercial portion and the self-sufficiency portion of the products, the communes and production teams selling more agricultural, sideline, and native specialty products to the state is of great benefit to increasing commune income and purchasing industrial products, to developing commodity production and commodity exchange, and to developing the commune economy and the entire national economy.

Striving for a comprehensive victory in agricultural product procurement is an important task on the current economic front. Party committees at all levels must seize the opportunity, mobilize and rely on the masses, strengthen leadership and inspection at all levels, and strive to quickly and comprehensively complete and overfulfill the state's agricultural product procurement tasks, achieving complete success in agricultural product procurement.

### 争取农产品收购满堂红

　　争取农产品收购满堂红
    今年农产品收购工作做得很好。由于各级党委的坚强领导，全体财贸部门职工、基层干部和全体农民群众的积极努力，农产品收购进度比以往任何一年都要快，已经取得了很大的成就。绝大部分省区已经完成和超额完成了粮食征购任务。全国茶叶、烤烟收购任务已经超额完成。棉花、食油和其他主要农产品的收购，也取得了很大成绩。今年全国普遍开展了“小秋收”运动，野生植物原料的收购比去年大大增加，到11月底，国家收购的野生纤维比去年同期大约增加两倍，野生淀粉原料增加一倍半以上，野生油料约增加两倍，野生烤胶原料大约增加四倍左右。在大搞农产品收购工作的同时，各级党委都注意了人民公社内部的农产品分配，注意了公社、生产队的生产安排和社员的生活安排。所有这些都充分证明了1959年农业生产的伟大成就，证明了人民公社不但在生产上而且在生活安排上以及收购上具有无比的优越性，证明了党的八届八中全会决议在保证1959年继续跃进中起了巨大的作用。
    现在农产品收购工作已经进入后期，虽然农产品收购进度一般很快，但是有些品种比如棉花、食油、麻类的收购任务还没有全面完成。我们必须乘胜前进，更加深入细致地做好工作，完成和超额完成棉花、食油、麻类和其他农产品的收购任务，力争农产品收购工作的全面胜利，保证农产品收购运动善始善终。
    在收购工作的后期，看起来需要收购的农产品的数量虽然比较少，但要最后完成，仍然必须努力抓紧，不可放松。这是因为：第一，当前农村工作的主要力量，包括领导力量和劳动力的绝大部分，已经转向兴修水利、积肥造肥、改良土壤、深耕深翻、冬季田间管理等等生产建设运动。第二，还没有收购起来的农产品，一般都是比较分散、零星，不少还在秸子上没有摘下或打下，要把这些东西收打下来和收购起来，所花的力量要比农产品大量登场和收购高潮时期为大。第三，到了后期，在干部和群众中间容易产生松劲情绪，容易产生忽视零星、分散的农产品的思想，容易发生草率了事、前紧后松的情况。所有这些都说明，要做好农产品收购的后期工作，必须继续反右倾、鼓干劲，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，坚持按政策办事，必须在服从农村中心工作的条件下，把各项工作更好地统筹兼顾，全面安排；必须穿插在整个农村冬季生产建设运动中，把收购工作做得更加深入，更加细致和更加踏实。
    根据各地反映的材料，目前许多地区还有一些应当收购的农产品没有收购起来。有些生产队、生产小队和社员手里还有一些应当出售的农产品。有些棉秸上还有些棉桃没有摘下来，或者摘下来而没有剥开。把这些没有收摘的劳动果实彻底收摘下来，不仅有助于完成国家收购任务，增加社会的财富，而且可以增加公社和生产队的收入。问题的关键在于各级党委继续加强对收摘工作和收购工作的领导，切实解决干部和群众中存在的思想问题。今年各地的经验再一次证明，农产品收购后期工作能不能彻底作好，决定于后期的收购工作是不是继续在党委的统一领导下进行，统一安排完成农产品收购任务必不可少的领导力量、劳动力和运输力；决定于收购后期党委继续加强收购运动的政治思想领导，很好地解决干部和群众中的思想问题。山东省蓬莱县大辛庄公社王太沟小队的干部，原来认为分配的四十三万斤花生仁的收购任务不能完成，但是公社党委在县委的直接领导下，切实加强了组织领导和思想领导，干部、群众情绪高涨，干劲十足，经过几天突击，结果收购了五十二万斤，超额完成了收购任务。这是一个很生动的例子，这种例子到处都有。但是也仍然有个别基层单位，后期收购工作没有在党委统一领导下进行，力量没有统一安排和调配，只有业务部门的一些人员在那里单独进行，结果收购工作进展迟缓。因此，这个问题必须引起重视。
    做好农产品收购后期工作，迅速完成收购任务，还必须开展群众性的短期突击运动。目前整个农村工作是以农田水利和冬季生产为中心。在这个时候，收购工作的群众运动，应该采取短期突击的方式。特别是对于那些收购任务完成得不好而实际情况又完全可以完成的品种和地区、公社、生产队，更应当在切实解决思想问题的基础上，在加强领导和统筹安排的条件下，挤出力量，挤出时间，选定时机，发动群众大搞一次到几次的短期突击，这是完成和超额完成后期农产品收购任务的最有效的办法。
    今年像往年一样，各地都正确贯彻执行了国家的农产品收购政策，保证了前一时期农产品收购工作的顺利进行。现在进入后期，各地必须继续执行国家政策，应该收购的农产品必须坚决收购起来，应该由公社、生产队和社员留用的必须坚决留下。对于收购工作中存在的实际问题，应该按照政策实事求是地加以解决。在粮食方面，没有完成任务的地区必须继续完成任务，应该留给公社、生产队的粮食必须根据国家政策留够，更重要的是，必须继续做好人民公社内部的粮食分配工作，安排好社员的生活。对于棉花、食油，应该根据国家规定的标准留够，其他应该收购的必须全部收购起来，能够超额完成任务的要坚决超额完成。其他农副土特产品，因为公社、生产队留用的很少，除了根据国家政策应该留用的留下以外，商品部分应当全部卖给国家。总之，在适当安排产品的商品部分和自给部分的比重的条件下，公社、生产队多卖农副土特产品给国家，对于增加公社收入和购买工业品，对于发展商品生产和商品交换，对于发展公社经济和整个国民经济，都有极大的好处。
    争取农产品收购的全面胜利，是当前经济战线上一项重要任务。各级党委必须抓紧时机，发动群众和依靠群众，层层加强领导和检查，力争迅速全面完成和超额完成国家农产品收购任务，做到农产品收购的满堂红。
