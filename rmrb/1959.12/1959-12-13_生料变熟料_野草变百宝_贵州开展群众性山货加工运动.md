    Turning Raw Materials into Finished Products, Turning Wild Plants into Treasures:
    Guizhou Launches a Mass Mountain Produce Processing Movement
    (Our newspaper, Guiyang, 4th dispatch) Following the "Small Autumn Harvest" high tide, Guizhou Province is now launching a mass movement to process wild raw materials. Currently, more than 250,000 processing plants and workshops have been established throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics from the four special districts/autonomous prefectures of Qiandongnan, Qiannan, Tongren, and Bijie, more than 730,000 dan of products such as fiber, starch, liquor, tannin extract, saltpeter, and alkaline have been processed.
    Guizhou Province has extremely rich wild raw materials. According to a preliminary survey, there are more than 1,000 types of usable wild raw materials, with a total output of more than 18 billion jin. Calculated at a minimum average price of four yuan per dan, this is worth more than 700 million yuan, equivalent to about 25% of Guizhou Province's total agricultural output value last year. To date, more than 2 billion jin of wild raw materials such as *Quercus acutissima* acorns, wild *Rhododendron simsii* flowers, and tea seeds have been collected.
    Many places throughout the province can use earthen basins and pots to produce tannin extract and man-made fiber. The people of all ethnic groups in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture have processed more than 19 million jin of products such as starch, tannin extract, and liquor using indigenous methods. Large quantities of wild fiber processed in Guiding County have been sold to Hunan, Hubei, Qingdao, and other places, and have been well received by users.
    In order to fully utilize wild raw materials, various localities, under slogans such as "multiple uses for one thing" and "making the most of everything," are vigorously carrying out technical innovations and comprehensive utilization. In many areas, in addition to extracting starch from *Quercus acutissima* acorns, they are also using them to brew liquor, extract tannin, and produce nearly ten varieties of other products. In Tongren and Qiandongnan and other regions, every 100 jin of *Quercus acutissima* acorns yields more than 20 jin of starch, 50 jin of 40-proof liquor, and some tannin extract, greatly increasing the income of commune members.

    生料变熟料　野草变百宝
    贵州开展群众性山货加工运动
    本报贵阳4日电　贵州省各地继“小秋收”高潮之后，又掀起一个群众性的野生原料加工运动。现在，全省已建立起二十五万多个加工厂和作坊。据黔东南、黔南、铜仁和毕节等四个专区、州的不完全统计，已加工出纤维、淀粉、白酒、栲胶、火硝和土碱等产品七十三万多担。
    贵州省的野生原料极为丰富，据初步调查，可以利用的野生原料有一千多种，总产量可达一百八十多亿斤。按最低平均价格每担四元计算，可值七亿多元，相当于去年贵州省农业总产值的25％左右。到目前为止，已采集青杠籽、野梦花、茶籽等野生原料有二十多亿斤。
    全省许多地方都能用土盆、土罐生产栲胶和人造纤维。黔东南苗族侗族自治区各族人民，利用土方法加工出的淀粉、栲胶和白酒等产品就有一千九百多万斤。贵定县加工出的大批野生纤维，已远销湖南、湖北和青岛等地。受到用户的欢迎。
    为了充分利用野生原料，各地在“一物多用”、“物尽其用”等口号下，正在大闹技术革新和大搞综合利用。许多地区除了用青杠籽（橡子）提炼淀粉外，还用它来酿酒、提炼栲胶等近十种品种。铜仁和黔东南等地区，每百斤青杠籽提炼出二十多斤淀粉，酿出四十度的白酒五十斤和部分栲胶，大大增加了社员的收入。（附图片）
