Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 18th: Shanghai's urban and suburban areas have formed a film projection network with more than one hundred projection teams. More than two hundred projectionists regularly tour factories and people's communes in various counties, going deep into production teams to show films, enriching the cultural life of the working people and popularizing scientific and technological knowledge and promoting advanced production experiences among them.

About a quarter of the projection teams in Shanghai's urban and suburban areas were developed since the Great Leap Forward last year. Currently, most projection teams are active in the eleven counties in the suburbs. Shanghai, Baoshan, and Pudong counties have an average of one projection team per commune, and each member can watch movies nearly nine times a year on average. Many projection teams have adopted fixed-time and fixed-point methods to deliver movies to the doorstep, making it easier for communes and production teams to arrange cultural and entertainment time in a planned way according to production needs. Since the beginning of this year, nearly two hundred new films have been screened in the eleven suburban counties.

In addition to screening a large number of artistic feature films, the projection teams also regularly screen relevant newsreels and science education films in conjunction with the current central work of the countryside and the farming season, directly serving production and playing the role of the Party's propaganda assistant. Not long ago, in coordination with the "Three Autumns" work, many projection teams concentrated their efforts on screening a batch of films celebrating the harvest and encouraging enthusiasm, such as "Agricultural Great Leap Forward" and "Man Will Conquer Nature".

    一百多放映队巡回工厂公社
    上海形成电影放映网
    新华社上海18日电　上海市区和郊区已形成一个拥有一百多个放映队的电影放映网。二百多个放映员经常巡回各县工厂、人民公社，深入生产队放映电影，使劳动人民文化生活日益丰富，并且在他们中间普及科学技术知识，推广先进生产经验。
    上海市区和郊区现有的放映队中，约四分之一是去年大跃进以来发展起来的。目前，大部分放映队都在市郊十一个县活动。上海、宝山、浦东三个县平均每个公社有一个放映队，平均每个社员每年能看电影近九次。许多放映队采取了定时、定点的办法，把电影送上门去，便于公社和生产队根据生产需要，有计划地安排文化娱乐时间。今年以来，市郊十一个县已经放映了近两百部新影片。
    放映队除了放映大量艺术故事片以外，还经常结合当前农村中心工作和农事季节，放映有关的新闻纪录片和科学教育片，直接服务于生产，起到了党的宣传助手作用。不久以前，配合“三秋”工作，许多放映队集中力量放映了一批庆丰收、鼓干劲的影片，如“农业大跃进”、“人定胜天”等。
