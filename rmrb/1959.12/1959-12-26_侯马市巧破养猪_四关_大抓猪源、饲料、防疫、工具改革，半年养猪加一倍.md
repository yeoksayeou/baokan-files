This newspaper Taiyuan, December 25th: Houma City, Shanxi Province, mobilized the masses to skillfully break through the four barriers of pig sources, feed, disease prevention, and labor, achieving high-speed development in the pig raising industry. At the end of June, the city's pig inventory was only over 62,000 heads, but by the end of November, it had surged to 151,133 heads, an increase of more than double.

This year in June, Houma City launched a large-scale pig raising movement. Initially, the Houma Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the reasons for the slow development of the pig raising industry in the past, and found that the main reason was that some cadres and commune members had ideological concerns about not having pig sources, not having feed, fearing hog cholera, and fearing excessive labor occupation. The Municipal Committee believed that in order to rapidly develop the pig raising industry, it was necessary to first break through the "four barriers" of pig sources, feed, disease prevention, and labor. Therefore, it was decided to carry out the pig raising movement with breaking through the "four barriers" as the center. The First Secretary of the Municipal Committee personally took charge, and pig raising guidance committees and groups were generally established in various communes and management areas, launching head-to-head competitions, and the movement quickly took shape throughout the city.

First, the Houma Municipal Committee, in the spirit of self-breeding and self-raising, vigorously grasped reproduction, calling on the whole party and all people to keep any sow they found, and never castrate a single one. In this way, the number of sows in the city increased sharply from more than 13,000 in June to 33,516. Communes, management areas, and production teams established responsibility systems for mating, pregnancy maintenance, and delivery, implemented separate feeding for pregnant sows, adding flour and feed, and launched mass competitions for "full mating, full pregnancy, full birth, and full survival." By early August, all 13,483 sows in the city had achieved full mating, with a pregnancy rate of 94%.

In July, the Houma Municipal Committee held on-site meetings in Yangdan Management Area of Qucun Commune and Shiwei Management Area of Zhaokang Commune to promote the advanced experience of these two management areas in solving feed problems through "collecting, storing, making, and planting." A new atmosphere of "going to the fields with baskets, and collecting wild vegetables when returning home" quickly emerged in the city. From July to the end of November, the city collected and stored a total of more than 46 million catties of various substitutes such as tree leaves, wild vegetables, straw, and sweet potato vines. At the same time, the city also established feed bases of more than 85,400 mu, expanding the sources of feed. The communes adopted five methods of pressing,沤 (fermenting), boiling, and stir-frying to enable pigs to eat more than 30 kinds of pig feed, achieving coarse feed being finely processed, greatly improving the quality of pig feed.

In terms of disease prevention, the city trained 473 disease prevention personnel with the commune as the unit. They promoted a system of checking every five days, disinfecting every half month, giving preventive injections once a month, and immediately isolating any diseases found. In the treatment of pigs, a combination of indigenous and foreign methods was adopted, absorbing folk prescriptions and producing various medicines such as indigenous chlortetracycline. Due to the strict implementation of the disease prevention and health care system, the transmission and prevalence of various diseases were effectively curbed. In the past five months, no hog cholera had occurred in the city. Some minor diseases in individual areas were quickly treated. Each pig farm also managed to set up warm beds in winter and build cool mats in summer, keeping the pigsty sunny, airy, clean, and hygienic, effectively preventing the spread of diseases.

In order to prevent the pig raising industry from occupying too much labor, Houma City implemented the methods of specialization, public raising, reforming tools, and retaining (retaining a certain number of pig raising workdays for commune members), uniformly and rationally arranging labor. The city selected 4,212 commune members with pig raising experience to form specialized teams. Fifteen pig farms had achieved semi-mechanization in the feeding process, which could save an average of more than 213,500 labor days per month, ensuring both the high-speed development of the pig raising industry and benefiting agricultural production.

　　侯马市巧破养猪“四关”
    大抓猪源、饲料、防疫、工具改革，半年养猪加一倍
    本报太原25日电　山西省侯马市发动群众巧破猪源、饲料、防疫、劳力四关，养猪事业获得了高速度的发展。6月底全市存栏猪仅有六万二千余头，到11月底猛增到十五万一千一百三十三头，增长了一倍多。
    今年6月侯马市掀起了一个大规模的养猪运动。开始，中共侯马市委对全市过去养猪事业发展缓慢的原因进行了分析，发现主要是由于部分干部和社员思想上存在着没有猪源，没饲料、怕猪瘟、怕多占劳力等顾虑。市委认为要使养猪事业迅速发展，必须首先攻破猪源、饲料、防疫、劳力“四关”。因此决定以突破“四关”为中心开展养猪运动。市委第一书记亲自挂帅，各公社和管理区普遍建立了养猪指导委员会和小组，展开了对手赛，运动很快在全市范围内形成。
    首先，侯马市委本着自繁自养的精神，大抓繁殖，号召全党全民见母猪就留，决不阉一头。这样全市母猪头数即由6月份的一万三千余头猛增为三万三千五百一十六头。各公社和管理区，生产队建立了配种、保胎、接产等责任制度，对怀胎母猪实行了分槽喂养，加面加料等办法，并开展了“全配种、全成胎、全产仔、全成活”的群众竞赛。到8月上旬，全市一万三千四百八十三头母猪实现了全配，成胎率达到了94％。
    7月间侯马市委又在曲村公社杨淡管理区和赵康公社史威管理区召开了现场会议，推广了这两个管理区“采、贮、制、种”等解决饲料的先进经验。全市迅速出现了“上地提篮篮，回家采野菜”的新气象。从7月到11月底，全市共采集贮备树叶、野菜、禾秆、薯蔓等各种代食品四千六百余万斤。同时，全市又建立了饲料基地八万五千四百余亩，扩大了饲料来源。各公社采取了压、沤、煮、炒等五种办法，使猪吃到三十余种猪食，做到粗料细作、大大提高了猪食的质量。
    在防疫方面，全市以公社为单位训练了防疫人员四百七十三名。推行了五日一检查，半月一消毒，一月打一次防疫针，发现了疾病立即隔离等制度。在猪的治疗方面，采取了土洋结合的办法，吸收民间土方，制出了土金霉素等多种药品。由于严格地执行了防疫保健制度，有效地制止了各种疾病的传染和流行，五个月以来，全市没有发生过猪瘟，个别地区发过一些小病，也迅速得到了治疗，各猪场，又根据季节作到了冬季设温床，夏季搭凉席，使猪圈保持阳光充足，空气新鲜，清洁卫生，有效地防止了疾病的流行。
    为了使养猪事业不过多的占用劳力，侯马市实行了专（专业化）、公（公养）、改（改革工具）、留（留给社员一定的养猪工作日）方法，统一地合理地安排了劳力。全市选拔了四千二百一十二名有养猪经验的社员组成专业队，有十五个猪场实现了饲养过程半机械化，平均每月可以节省劳动力二十一万三千五百余个，既保证养猪事业的高速度发展，又有利于农业生产。
