　　Wall Street Makes a Fortune Through Military Production
    "Workers' Weekly" Reveals the Reason for America's Enthusiasm for the Cold War
    Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: The American "Workers' Weekly" recently published a series of articles by Daniel Mason, revealing the reasons why the American ruling group is desperately trying to maintain the "Cold War." The article stated that continuing the production of war materials is of great interest to the huge wealth of Wall Street. In 1958, the US government spent 45 billion US dollars on defense, while it spent 180 billion US dollars on all industrial products. The former accounts for a quarter of the basic economic sectors.
    The article quoted "New York Times" reporter Baldwin as saying: "The defense industry, especially the aircraft and missile industry, is a multi-billion dollar business. Thousands of people, several entire cities and regions, and several entire industrial sectors, currently rely entirely or mostly on military orders."
    Mason pointed out that at the end of the war, 250 large companies seized more than two-thirds of all large manufacturing equipment, which was the sum of the US production capacity before World War II. These 250 large companies are controlled by five major consortia - Rockefeller, Morgan, Mellon, DuPont and Cleveland.
    This is the reason why Nelson Rockefeller opposes banning nuclear weapons tests.
    The article said that in the past twelve years, the United States' expenditure on manufacturing military equipment has increased from 11.5 billion US dollars to 45 billion US dollars, making the monopoly capitalists rich.
  Mason pointed out that senior civilian and military officials of the Pentagon play an important role in the manipulation of monopoly capital to maintain and increase this billion-dollar arms trade. They are arms brokers and salesmen, and also agents of Wall Street. Due to their successful promotion, these military personnel receive a share of the spoils after retirement. A Department of Defense report in June of this year showed that 721 retired officers with the rank of colonel or above were employed by 88 of the 100 major companies producing military equipment for the government.
    Mason said that US Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates admitted that companies producing military equipment employed 300 retired naval officers.

### 华尔街靠军事生产发横财  “工人周报”揭露美国热衷冷战原因

　　华尔街靠军事生产发横财
    “工人周报”揭露美国热衷冷战原因
    据新华社25日讯　美国“工人周报”最近几期发表的丹尼尔·梅森的连载文章，揭露了美国统治集团拼命要保持“冷战”的原因。文章说，继续生产战争物资对华尔街的巨富有巨大利害关系。1958年美国政府用在国防上的钱是四百五十亿美元，而用在所有工业产品上的钱是一千八百亿美元。前者占基本经济部门的四分之一。
    文章引“纽约时报”记者鲍德温的话说：“国防工业，特别是飞机和导弹工业是一种数十亿美元的买卖，成千上万的人、若干整个城市和地区、以及若干整个工业部门，目前都完全或者大部分依靠军火订货。”
    梅森指出，大战结束时，二百五十家大公司攫取了一切大制造设备的三分之二以上，为第二次世界大战以前美国生产能力的总和。这二百五十家大公司是受五个大财团——洛克菲勒、摩根、梅隆、杜邦和克利夫兰财团——控制的。
    纳尔逊·洛克菲勒所以反对禁止核武器试验，其原因就在这里。
    文章说，最近十二年来，美国用于制造军备的开支从一百一十五亿美元增加到四百五十亿美元，使垄断资本家大发横财。
  梅森指出，在垄断资本进行操纵以维持和增加这笔亿万美元的军火买卖中，五角大楼的高级文官武将起着重要的作用。他们是军火经纪人和推销员，又是华尔街的代理人。由于推销有功，这些军人退伍后分得一份赃品。今年6月国防部的一份报告表明，有七百二十一名退伍的上校以上的军官受雇于为政府生产军火的一百家主要公司中的八十八家。
    梅森说，美国国防部长托马斯·盖茨承认，生产军火的公司雇用了三百名退伍的海军军官。
