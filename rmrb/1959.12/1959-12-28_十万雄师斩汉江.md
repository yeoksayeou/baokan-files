One Hundred Thousand Strong Army Cuts the Han River
By Our Reporters Cao Baoming, Tian Zhuang

Last June, as soon as the design of the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project in Hubei was formally approved, a problem arose: When should construction begin? Some people analyzed the situation and said: This project will store more than 28 billion cubic meters of water, creating an artificial lake of more than 1,000 square kilometers, larger than Hongze Lake. Its more than 600-meter-long dam is 125 meters high, requiring the pouring of more than 3.2 million cubic meters of concrete, and the installation of giant generators and ship lifts. According to convention, the construction of giant projects has a considerable preparatory stage, requiring the prior construction of railways, the allocation of equipment, and the establishment of construction bases. Thus, the earliest it could officially start would be this winter. Some comrades, led by Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Governor of the province, analyzed another situation based on the provincial Party Committee's policy of "putting politics in command, strengthening leadership, relying on the masses, self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, focusing on indigenous methods, and progressing from indigenous to foreign methods": building the Danjiangkou project one year earlier would relieve the threat posed by the Han River to the people on both banks one year earlier, irrigate 15 million mu of land one year earlier, and generate more than 4.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. They believed that the people on both banks had an urgent need to control the Han River, and that the engineering and geological data were complete. As long as they truly relied on the masses, they could overcome various difficulties in construction. They proposed the idea of "getting started first, then whipping the horse," advocating starting construction early, using the action of starting construction to promote the maturity of various conditions and accelerate the progress of the project.

The key to whether construction could start early lay in what method to use for underwater construction. According to the original construction design, steel sheet piles would be used as cofferdams, and then the foundation pit would be cleaned and concrete poured inside the cofferdams. This would require 2,100 tons of steel sheet piles, which were not produced in large quantities domestically. Ordering from abroad would delay the start of construction by at least one year. Later, it was changed to wooden sheet pile cofferdams, which would require 3,000 cubic meters of fir wood, 10 meters long and 30 centimeters wide. Wuhan could not gather enough in time, and temporary transport from the mountains would not catch up with the dry season for construction, pushing the project back. Comrade Zhang Tixue again convened the heads of the province's ten major water conservancy projects to Danjiangkou for an on-site meeting to find new construction methods. Rao Mintai, Deputy Commissioner of the Jingzhou Special District—a model county head in the construction of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project—and Yang Mingtang, chief engineer of the Zhanghe Reservoir, proposed a "using earth to drive back water" solution of earth, sand, and stone combination cofferdams, based on the traditional water control experience of the motherland. This way, stone could be extracted from Jijiaya and Xiaojiang Village on the left bank of the construction site, earth from Huangtuling on the right bank, and sand from Yulangtan near the downstream area, without using a single steel sheet pile or wooden sheet pile. At the same time, the people on both banks, who had been fighting floods for generations, had rich experience in this construction method, eliminating the need to train technicians from scratch.

Thus, the massive Danjiangkou project started early with indigenous methods, with the support of the Party and the people.

On September 1st last year, the day construction began, there were only a thousand people at the Danjiangkou construction site. Even the 200 jin of explosives used to open the mountain were borrowed from the neighboring Guanghua County. However, a cannon blast echoed like spring thunder across both banks of the Han River and throughout the country. Technical workers were sent to them from the Sanmenxia and Huai River construction sites. Songzi County, south of the Yangtze River, sent more than 500 water control heroes led by Ding Yongshan, the hero of the Hudu River cutoff. The 117 communes in seventeen counties on both banks of the Han River sent thousands upon thousands of outstanding sons and daughters. By early October, more than 20,000 people had gathered at the Danjiangkou construction site, increasing to more than 60,000 in early November, and eventually reaching more than 100,000, forming a one hundred thousand strong army to battle the Danjiangkou project.

In those days, everywhere you could see fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, vying to sign up. The young people said they were strong and could endure hardship; the old people said they had more water control experience. In short, everyone wanted to go to Danjiangkou! Who could stop their enthusiasm? Guo Xinqian, a fifty-year-old member of the Maze Commune in Tianmen County, recalled the scene of being flooded five times in six years from 1935 to 1940: his mother-in-law and uncle were swept away by the flood, his second younger sister starved to death, his remaining three younger sisters were given away as child brides, and he himself wandered to other villages as a laborer, wearing only a single pair of pants for seven consecutive winters. Which family on both banks of the Han River didn't have such a tragic story? They had a folk song that everyone could sing: "The flood waves are raging, nine out of ten years are flooded, sell your son to exchange for rice, sell your daughter to pay taxes, starve the yellow cattle and beat the dog to death, carry your bags and walk to the horizon!" This reflected the disasters suffered by the people at that time. Now, to control the Han River and turn the flood into water conservancy, Guo Xinqian and thousands upon thousands of people carried their bags and tools and converged on Danjiangkou from all directions.

The early construction of the Danjiangkou project reflected the people's urgent need to control the Han River, and ignited the people's revolutionary enthusiasm to fight nature. At that time, there were no sheds on the construction site, so they built them themselves; there were no roads, so they opened them themselves; there were no tools, so they made them themselves. They overcame all kinds of difficulties and set up connected camps in the mountains and valleys on both sides of the turbulent Han River. These migrant workers also spontaneously organized "Rocket", "Flying Tiger", and "Wu Song" shock teams, and launched a heated competition in the mountains and down by the river. On the crowded construction site, everywhere you could see young men and women wearing identical sportswear. Following folk customs, they flew along row by row with earth baskets to the rapid rhythm of suonas and drums. The elderly Wu Mengcheng and Guo Xinqian were not willing to be outdone, and connected the older migrant workers to compete with the young people. They carried more, walked faster, and made some leading cadres come to persuade them: "Danjiangkou cannot be built in one day, we must combine work and rest well!"

It was this fighting-spirited team that leveled Huangtuling, split Xiaojiang Village, and hollowed out Yulangtan in fifty days, pouring more than one million cubic meters of earth, sand, and stone into the river, and building a 1,200-meter-long embankment, 10 meters high and 6 meters wide, forcing the rushing Han River into only one-third of its original channel on the left bank. Immediately afterward, they continued to raise and strengthen the cofferdam while pumping water, clearing the foundation pit, so that the ancient Han River revealed its rock surface, and the millennial abyss revealed its bottom.

In March, the riverbed on the right bank was under intense construction. According to the original plan, the low-water cofferdam in March would only defend against the peach blossom flood with an elevation of 93 meters (calculated from Wusongkou) and a flow rate of 3,700 cubic meters per second. Who knew that the Han River would suddenly launch a peach blossom flood unseen in a century, rising two meters in three days, reaching an elevation of 94.36 meters and a flow rate of 5,590 cubic meters. The flood brought a severe test to the earthen cofferdam! At this time, Comrade Zhang Tixue, who concurrently served as the Secretary of the Party Committee and General Commander of the Danjiangkou Project, along with Deputy Secretary Ren Shishun, Shi Chuan, and many other leading comrades, stayed with the migrant workers on the right bank embankment. The migrant workers who were selected for their rich water control experience patrolled the embankment every fifteen steps, monitoring the rolling and surging river day and night.

On March 31st—this unforgettable day, the sky, which had been raining for days, revealed a ray of sunlight, and the water level began to drop. The leading comrades returned to the left bank headquarters to handle the backlog of official duties, but the cunning Han River took advantage of the unguarded moment and broke a small hole in the earthen dam near the eighteen-span dam. When Comrade Shi Chuan, who was left to guard the right bank, rushed there, it had already turned into a hole, spraying water into the cofferdam like a six-inch water pipe. He quickly jumped over to block the opening with his body, but the intense spray of water pushed him back several feet. Another migrant worker followed and tried to block it with his body, but was pushed even further by the water. At this time, the migrant workers taking earth on the ridge rushed over, the stone-transporting boats in the river rushed over, and the cadres working on the left bank also rushed over. Thousands upon thousands of people rushed to this dangerous section. A 50-meter-long section of the embankment suddenly shook and sank more than one meter deep under the water, and the flood poured in like a waterfall. Should they retreat to grab the machines, or fight the flood to ensure the cofferdam? This was a critical moment! Encouraged by the will to build the project as soon as possible, the heroic sons and daughters had only one desire: to stop the flood! In an instant, everyone formed several layers of "human dams" inside and outside the breach, constantly carrying grass bags and sacks, and filling them into the water. The stone-transporting boats coming from the river also waved their axes to cut off the masts and pierced the cabins, sinking them outside the breach. At this time, someone shouted that they needed cotton to plug the hole, and everyone quickly tore off the cotton clothes they were wearing and took out the cotton quilts they were covering themselves with to stuff into the hole. Needing a large amount of earth and stone, the young men carried large sacks weighing more than 300 jin and ran quickly. In just two or three hours, they drove the unexpected flood out of the embankment! At this time, Comrade Zhang Tixue, who had always insisted on commanding the rescue on the dangerous dam, issued an order: "Raise the cofferdam to an elevation that can resist the largest flood!"

A fierce battle immediately unfolded inside and outside the right bank foundation pit. On May 1st, a concrete dam seven or eight zhang high and nearly one li long rose in the center of the Han River (longitudinal cofferdam). Two huge slogans were written on the city wall-like dam: "Speed First, Quality First, Thrift First!" "Everything for Interception This Winter!" Having overcome four flood peaks and consistently blocking the flood outside the solid high dam, Danjiangkou began pouring the concrete foundation of the right bank dam and preparing for the interception of the left bank.

In this year's construction, other large construction sites used pneumatic drills to drill holes and open mountains, but they did not have pneumatic drills, so they used steel chisels and iron hammers instead. Initially, three people "ding-dang" for a day and couldn't even drill one meter, and the efficiency was very low. Lu Xianming, a migrant worker who was digging the rock layer at the bottom of the river, created the method of chiseling stone with a hammer, which immediately increased the efficiency by six times. Cai Changbai, a migrant worker who was mining boulders, also used large shafts and pulleys to create a drilling machine, which greatly reduced labor intensity and increased efficiency by three times. Other large construction sites used cranes for lifting, and belt conveyors and rail dump trucks for transporting earth and stone, but they did not have them, so they made their own wooden universal booms and pulleys, pulley cars, and bamboo curtain soil turners instead. Wu Mengcheng, a migrant worker known as the "Old General," and Lu Ze Zhou, a commune cadre, also made a "railway skateboard"—laying a railway track from the mountain to the river, and loading a wooden frame with iron shafts with thousands of catties of boulders, which would slide quickly for hundreds of meters. Everyone praised it as "no paddles, no poles, no diesel or coal burning, just put it on the railway and it flies." Under the slogan "ask for speed from technical innovation, ask for time from high efficiency," the entire construction site basically abandoned shoulder poles and achieved cartization and semi-mechanization of earthwork within a few days.

In this year's construction, due to the implementation of the "indigenous methods first" measures, the construction site, which originally had only 30 kilowatts of power generation equipment, successively transferred 13,000 kilowatts of power, nearly 10,000 horsepower of water pumps, four gantry cranes, six sand dredgers, and two hundred vehicles from various places, and built concrete mixing plants, mechanical repair shops, and railways for transporting stone materials. At the same time, it trained more than 10,000 workers, creating conditions for large-scale mechanical construction.

In the first half of December, the construction site had completed 9.2 million cubic meters of earth, sand, and stone, poured 410,000 cubic meters of concrete, and built the right bank dam to the elevation required for interception. The battle to intercept the Han River began on the 25th. This giant water conservancy project, which originally could not have started until this winter at the earliest, will undertake the task of storing more than 2 billion cubic meters of floodwater next year!

　　十万雄师斩汉江
　　本报记者　曹葆铭　田庄
    去年6月，湖北丹江口水利枢纽工程的设计刚作出正式鉴定，便遇到一个问题：什么时候动工兴建？有人分析情况说：这个工程将蓄水二百八十多亿立方米，造起一个一千多平方公里的人工湖，比洪泽湖还大。它的六百多米长的拦河大坝有一百二十五米高，要浇灌三百二十多万方混凝土，并且安装巨型发电机和升船机，按照惯例，修建巨型工程都有个相当长的施工准备阶段，要事先修筑铁路、调集器材，建起施工基地。这样，最早也得在今年冬季才能正式动工。以湖北省委书记、省长张体学为首的一些同志，却根据省委提出的“政治挂帅，加强领导，依靠群众，自力更生，土洋并举，以土为主，从土到洋”的方针，分析了另一个情况：丹江口工程早一年修起来，就能早一年解除汉水给两岸人民带来的威胁，就能早一年灌溉一千五百万亩田地，多发四十五亿多度电。他们认为，两岸人民有根治汉水的迫切要求，而工程和地质资料齐全，只要认真依靠群众，便能战胜施工中的各种困难。他们提出了“先上马，后加鞭”的意见，主张提早开工，用开工的行动来促进各种条件的成熟，加速工程的进展。
    能不能提早开工的关键，还在于用什么方法进行水下施工？按照原来的施工设计，是用钢板桩作围堰，然后在围堰里清理基坑、浇注混凝土。这样就得二千一百吨钢板桩，国内没有大批生产，向国外订货最少也得推迟一年才能开工。后来改为木板桩围堰，也得十米长、三十分米宽的杉木三千立方米，武汉一时凑不齐，临时从山上运来，也赶不上枯水施工季节，要把工程推迟。张体学同志又召集全省十大水利工程的负责人到丹江口开现场会议，找寻新的施工方法。荆州专区副专员饶民太——这个在修建荆江分洪工程中的模范县长和漳河水库总工程师杨铭堂，根据祖国传统的治水经验，提出了“以土赶水”的土沙石组合围堰的方案。这样，从工地左岸纪家崖和小江村开石，从右岸黄土岭取土，从下游附近的鱼浪滩挖沙，不用一块钢板桩和一块木板桩，便能施工。同时，祖祖辈辈就同洪水斗争的两岸人民，对这种施工方法有着丰富的经验，用不着从头培训技工。
    巨大的丹江口工程，就这样在党和人民的支持下，提前用土法开工了。
    去年9月1日开工那天，丹江口工地总共只有千把人，连开山的两百斤炸药也是从邻近的光化县借来的。但是，一声炮响，就像春雷般地响遍了汉江两岸和全国各地。三门峡和淮河工地给他们送来了技术工人。长江南岸的松滋县给他们派来了以虎渡河截流英雄丁永善为首的五百多名治水健儿。汉江两岸的十七个县一百一十七个公社，更派来了千千万万的优秀儿女。丹江口工地在10月初就聚集了两万多人，11月初增加到六万多人，最后更达到十万多人，组成了大战丹江口的十万雄师。
    在那些日子里，到处都能见到父子、兄妹争着报名的事，年轻的说他身体壮能吃苦耐劳；年老的说他治水经验多，总之，都要到丹江口去！谁能阻止他们这种热情呢？天门县麻泽公社的五十岁的社员郭信千回忆起1935年至1940年六年连淹五水的情景：他的岳母和舅哥被洪水冲走了，他的二妹饿死了，他的其余的三个妹妹送给人家当了童养媳，他自己流落外乡帮工，一连七个冬天都只穿条单裤。在汉水两岸的农民，那家没有这样一段辛酸事呢？他们有首人人会唱的民歌：“大水浪滔天，十年倒有九年淹，卖掉儿子把米换，卖掉女儿好上捐，饿死黄牛打死狗，背起包裹走天边！”这反映了当时人民所受的灾难。现在要根治汉水，把水患变为水利，郭信千和千千万万的人们，都背着行囊，带着工具，从四面八方汇合到丹江口来了。
    提前修建丹江口工程反映了人民根治汉水的迫切要求，激发了人民向自然开战的革命热情。工地当时没有工棚，他们就自己盖；没有道路，就自己开；没有工具，就自己造；他们战胜了各种各样的困难，在急湍的汉水两旁的山岭涧谷里安扎下连营寨了。这些民工们还自动组织起“火箭”、“飞虎”、“武松”等突击队，在山上、河下开展起热烈的竞赛。在人群密布的工地上，到处都能见到穿着一色运动服的小伙子和姑娘，他们按照民间的习俗，随唢呐伴着锣鼓的急促节奏，一行行地挑着土筐飞跑。年老的吴孟成、郭信千也不服输，把年岁大些的民工串连起来，跟青年们比赛。他们挑的多，走的快，闹得一些领导干部都来劝说他们：“丹江口不是一天能修起的，要把劳逸结合好啊！”
    就是这支斗志昂扬的队伍，他们在五十天当中，便削平了黄土岭，劈开了小江村，挖空了鱼浪滩，把一百多万土沙石方倒进河里，在河上筑起了十米高、六米宽的围堤一千二百米，把激流的汉水逼到左岸只有三分之一的河槽里了。紧接着，他们又一边加高加固围堰，一边抽水，清理基坑，使万载汉水露出了岩面，千年深渊现出了潭底。
    3月，右岸的河下正在紧张施工。按照原定计划，3月的低水围堰只防御九十三米高程（从吴淞口算起）和三千七百个流量（每秒钟流水多少立方米）的桃汛。谁知道，汉水却突然发起百年未遇的桃汛，三天涨了两米高，升到了九十四点三六米高程、五千五百九十个流量。洪流给土围堰带来了严重的考验！这时候，兼任丹江口工程党委书记和总指挥长的张体学同志、副书记任士舜、石川等许多领导同志，都同民工们一起坚持在右岸围堤上。挑选出来的治水经验丰富的民工，都十五步一人，来回巡守在堤防上，日夜监视着翻滚汹涌的江水。
    31日——这个难忘的日子，连日阴雨的天空露出一丝太阳，水位开始下降。领导同志们才回左岸总部处理积压了几天的公务，狡猾的汉水却乘人不备的时候，在十八跨大坝附近的土堤冲开了一个小洞。当留守在右岸的石川同志赶去时，它已冲成一个窟窿，像一个六寸水管朝围堰里喷水。他连忙跳过去用身子堵口，激烈的喷水一下子就把他冲开好几尺远。另一个民工也跟上去用身子堵，被水冲得更远。这时，在岭上取土的民工赶来了，在河里运石的民船赶来了，在左岸办公的干部也赶来了，千千万万的人群都奔向这个出险地段。五十多米长的一段堤防又突然一声震动，就沉到水下一米多深，洪水像瀑布般地倾泻进来。是撤退下来抢机器，还是同洪水搏斗确保围堤？这是个紧急关头！为早日建起工程的意志鼓舞的英雄儿女，都只有一个意愿：堵住洪水！瞬息间，大家便在缺口内外的水里组成了几层“人堤”，不断地背草包、扛麻包，往水里填塞。从江上赶来的运石船，也挥起斧头砍断桅杆，凿穿船舱，沉在缺口外边。这时候，谁喊了一声需要棉花堵洞，大家就连忙扒下身上的棉衣，拿出盖的棉被，往洞口塞。需要大量土石，小伙子们就一人扛起三百多斤一个的大麻包飞跑。只不过两三个钟头，就把这意外袭来的洪流，赶到堤外去了！这时候，始终坚持在险堤上指挥抢险的张体学同志，又发布命令：“把围堰加高到能抗御最大洪水的高程！”
    在右岸基坑内外，马上展开了一场激战。5月1日，汉水中心就升起了一道七八丈高、近一里长的混凝土大堤，（纵向围堰），城垣般的堤上书写着两个巨大的标语：“速度第一、质量第一、勤俭第一！”“一切为了今冬截流！”战胜了四次洪峰、始终把洪水阻挡在坚固的高堤外面的丹江口，这时开始了浇灌右岸大坝混凝土基础和准备左岸截流的工程。
    在这一年的施工当中，别的大工地都是用风钻打眼开山，他们没有风钻，便用钢钎和铁锤代替。最初，三个人“叮当”一天还钻不进一米，工效很低。开挖河底岩层的民工芦先明创造了钢钎带锤冲石法，立时使工效提高了六倍。开采蛮石的民工蔡昌柏也利用大轴、滑轮制造出一种打眼机，大大地减轻了劳动强度，提高了工效三倍。别的大工地都是用吊机起重，用皮带运输机和铁轨斗车运送土石，他们没有，便自制木质的万能吊杆和滑丝、滑车、竹帘翻土器等代替。被称为“老将军”的民工吴孟成和公社干部吕泽洲还制成一种“铁轨滑板”——从山上铺条铁轨到江边，带铁轴的木架一装上千斤蛮石，便飞速地滑行几百米远。大家称赞它是“不用桨、不用篙，不用柴油炭火烧，架上铁轨就飞跑”。全工地几天之间就在“向技术革新要速度，向高工效要时间”的口号下，基本上丢掉了扁担，实现了车子化和土机械化。
    在这一年施工当中，由于实行了“土法上马”的措施，这个原来只有三十瓩发电设备的工地，也先后从各地调来了一万三千瓩电源、近一万马力的抽水机、四台门式吊机、六艘采砂船和两百辆汽车，建起了混凝土搅拌楼、机械修配厂和运送石料的铁路，同时培训了一万多名工人，为大规模机械施工创造了条件。
    12月上半月，这个工地已经完成九百二十万土沙石方，浇灌了四十一万方混凝土，把右岸大坝筑到了截流所需要的高程。截流汉水的战斗在25日开始了。这个本来最早也得在今年冬季才能开工的巨型水利工程，明年就将担负起滞洪二十多亿方的任务了！（附图片）
