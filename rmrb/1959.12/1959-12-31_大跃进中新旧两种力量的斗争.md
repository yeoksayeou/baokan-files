　　The people of our country, under the correct leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, hold high the bright banner of Marxism-Leninism for continuous revolution and forge ahead courageously, enabling the socialist revolution to deepen step by step and socialist construction to achieve victory after victory. The emergence of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy and the healthy development of the rural people's commune movement fully demonstrate the close relationship between socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    In such an extraordinarily broad and profound revolutionary struggle, everyone's class nature will be fully revealed. Whether one is a warrior or a coward of the socialist revolution; a loyal comrade of the proletarian cause or a temporary fellow traveler of Marxism; a firm defender of the Party's line or a shameful deserter who betrays the interests of the people, the process of struggle will reveal all of this clearly and without omission.
    The following two typical examples prove that there is often a struggle between new and old forces in socialist construction, which is a reflection of the class struggle being carried out in new forms and with new laws under the new conditions. These two typical examples also prove that socialist revolution and socialist construction are absolutely inseparable; socialist revolution is still needed in socialist construction, and in any economic and cultural construction endeavor, there must be a struggle between two roads and two lines, and it is absolutely necessary to implement putting politics in command, that is, strengthening the Party's leadership. In order to consolidate and develop the victories achieved by the socialist revolution on the economic front, it is also necessary to carry out socialist revolution and achieve victory on the political and ideological fronts.
    Both examples occurred in the tide of the Great Leap Forward, and both occurred in rural grassroots organizations in Guizhou. They represent two new and old forces, representing two completely opposite directions. One is the socialist direction, and the other is the capitalist direction. The protagonist in one event is a fighter who resolutely defends the Party's general line and defends the socialist cause; the other fact proves to be a temporary fellow traveler of the people's revolutionary cause.
    In less than a year after its establishment, the Tupi People's Commune in Zheng'an County has often been attacked by a small handful of wealthy peasants. Especially in August and September of this year, they issued fallacies such as "People's communes are not good" and "The present is not as good as the past." This attack angered the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants, and even more so the commune member Liu Shaozhou, who came from a poor peasant background. He stood up on the spot, waving his arm that was chopped off by the landlord before liberation, and told his personal experiences to the public, telling the benefits that the people's commune brought him. Finally, he firmly said: "We must not forget our roots, we must always follow the Communist Party."
    Like thousands of poor peasants, Liu Shaozhou suffered exploitation and oppression in the old society. He rented land from landlords, worked hard all year round, but lived a life worse than that of cattle and horses. He ate ferns and tree bark, wore "seedling felt clothes," and covered himself with "seedling felt quilts." The reactionary government arrested soldiers and levied taxes, forcing his family to flee famine and live in caves from time to time. Even so, he could not escape the disaster. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month in 1936, his family did not even have a handful of rice for the New Year's meal, but the landlord came to press for rent and debt, and wanted to take his daughter as collateral. At that time, Liu Shaozhou stepped forward angrily to stop him and had his right hand chopped off by the landlord with a knife. After liberation, the landlord was overthrown. Liu Shaozhou's family's life got better day by day. Last year, when the people's commune was established, his family's life became even better. Now, his family has three new tile-roofed houses, all three children are in school, and he himself raises pigs for the commune. Based on labor income, the family does not have to worry about food and clothing. Not only do they have cotton quilts, but they also have mosquito nets. People like Liu Shaozhou, as long as they have not "forgotten their roots," how can they not stand up and wage a resolute struggle against those who attack the people's commune system and attack the Party's line?
    Now, under the leadership and support of the commune Party committee and the county Party committee, Liu Shaozhou is carrying his luggage, carrying his past "thousand-patched clothes," "seedling felt clothes," and "seedling felt quilts," and carrying the remains of his arm that was chopped off by the landlord before liberation, to various places to tell the masses about his personal experiences and refute the fallacies of a small number of wealthy peasants who oppose socialism. He went to Zunyi and Guiyang. At least tens of thousands of people have heard his speeches and seen the physical exhibition of the contrast between his new and old lives, and have received a profound political and ideological education, strengthening their determination to follow the socialist road.
    Liu Shaozhou is just one of the thousands of awakened poor people. Like him, there are also tens of thousands of people who consciously stand firm in the class struggle under new conditions and rise up to fight back against the attacks of a small number of wealthy peasants in order to defend the Party's general line and the people's commune system. The emergence of such a group of advanced elements in the countryside is the backbone force that holds high the banner of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune and forges ahead bravely. Any anti-socialist fallacy is refuted by them to the point of being completely untenable. However, in this same era of struggle, we can also see another phenomenon, that is, a very small number of people who hold a bourgeois world outlook and are not firm in the revolution, show cowardice, wavering, and lack of integrity in the face of the attacks of wealthy peasants, become megaphones for the opinions of wealthy peasants, and even directly become vanguards attacking the Party's general line.
    Almost at the same time that Liu Shaozhou stood up to fight back against the attacks of wealthy peasants and resolutely defended socialism, in Ganxi District, Yanhe County, which is connected to Zheng'an County, a township head named Jiang Yuchang took the lead in issuing a challenge to the Party and the people, and put forward a complete set of programs for restoring the capitalist system. His program (which is also his proposal) is very long, and it is impossible to quote the full text here. We only need to mention a few of the main points to discuss it.
    The title of Jiang Yuchang's proposal is "Suggestions on Reconstructing Agricultural Production Management and Commercial Activities." Please see how he wants to "reconstruct" our agriculture and commerce. The basic point of his "reconstruction" of agricultural production is to "rent out" all means of production, including land, forests, water conservancy, infrastructure, and large agricultural tools, "to the production households," and each production household will pay a certain amount of products to the state or collective on an annual or crop-period basis. "Implement independent management by each production household, and each household is responsible for its own profits and losses." Needless to say, this is a thorough proposal to restore individual farming, and to redistribute the already collectivized land, forests, water conservancy, and agricultural tools to each individual for private ownership. However, Jiang Yuchang quibbles that he is not advocating retrogression, nor is he advocating restoring individual farming. As for some other suggestions he made in "reconstructing" agriculture, such as dissolving collective canteens, advocating freedom to hire labor, and demanding changes to the current distribution system, there is no need to go into them here.
    In his suggestions for "reconstructing" commerce, the basic point is to advocate "opening up the free market" and restoring private commerce. According to him, "abolish all restrictions and blockades, and develop retail and wholesale merchants," which will "both promote the enthusiasm of producers and transporters" and "reduce the burden on state-owned commercial departments in the procurement and sales links." In short, he believes that restoring private commerce is infinitely beneficial. He also said that restoring private commerce is to "promote historical traditions and habits, integrating purchase and sales, integrating agriculture and commerce, and integrating industry and commerce." If Jiang Yuchang's suggestions were followed, it would inevitably be, and could only be, a repeat of the old history of man exploiting man.
    From Jiang Yuchang's proposal, we can see a characteristic, that is, although the reactionary program is put forward extremely bluntly, he does not dare to put forward the words of canceling the people's commune or not taking the socialist road head-on. He just exaggerates the shortcomings of the people's commune as much as possible, and tries his best to exaggerate the problems and difficulties in our work, in order to disguise himself as if he is motivated by finding solutions to problems for the Party and the government. This is a new feature of class struggle under new conditions, because the people's commune has received such widespread mass support, the tide of the Great Leap Forward is so unstoppable, and the Party's general line has been so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people that if the people's commune, the Great Leap Forward, and the general line are directly criticized and opposed, they will immediately be "dealt a head-on blow" by the people. The people's socialist and communist consciousness has been further improved, and any tricks and methods of these people are in vain. Since the emergence of the Great Leap Forward and the establishment of the People's Commune, various anti-socialist fallacies and various opinions representing the ideology of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie have been refuted by the broad masses many times.
    The two examples of Liu Shaozhou and Jiang Yuchang are both natural phenomena of class struggle under certain conditions. However, Liu Shaozhou represents the vast majority of peasants and represents the overwhelming majority of people in the countryside who resolutely support socialism, while Jiang Yuchang represents a small part of the wealthy peasants' resistance to socialist transformation and their nostalgia for the capitalist system. Their actions are all strongly colored by their class nature. The difference between Jiang Yuchang and Liu Shaozhou is that he was born into a relatively wealthy family and was originally a small intellectual. Although he has been a cadre for several years and has received many years of education from the Party and the Communist Youth League, his thinking has not been transformed. Therefore, it is not surprising that he has become a representative of a small number of wealthy peasants resisting socialism in the current rural class struggle.
    The above two examples once again illustrate the truth that as long as there are still class differences and as long as there is still the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, class struggle will not stop. Throughout the entire transition period of capitalism to socialism, the ideological and political struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is wave-like, sometimes high, sometimes low, then high again, then low again. Until the ideological and political influence of the bourgeoisie is finally eliminated. August and September of this year were the time when class struggle in our country's rural areas was high after the realization of the people's communes. It is no accident that the two positive and negative representatives, Liu Shaozhou and Jiang Yuchang, appeared at this time.
    Since class struggle is being carried out under a new law and form under the dictatorship of the proletariat and during the period of socialist construction, then we have no reason not to emphasize the role of putting politics in command and the leadership of the Party in all construction undertakings. In fact, no construction work does not have the nature and significance of class struggle. Even things like technical reform cannot be an exception. In recent years, the struggle we have carried out in rural areas to implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" has also illustrated this point. Who are the people who are hindering the implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture"? Who are the people who are against deep plowing, against rational close planting, and against the promotion of new agricultural tools? Upon investigation, in most cases, it is a part of the wealthy peasants. Their purpose in opposing these is to attempt to compete with the Party for the leadership of agricultural production. They are trying to prove that the Party and the People's Government cannot lead agricultural production, and are trying to prove that agricultural production can develop without the leadership of the Party and the government. Of course, the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" put forward by the Party, like all other policies and measures, has been actively supported by the vast majority of peasants and has been seriously implemented in agricultural production. The actual situation is that in recent years, we have achieved great increases in production and great harvests on the agricultural production front year after year, which is the specific result of implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and is also the victorious result of class struggle in agricultural technical reform, and of course, it is also the victorious result of adhering to the Party's leadership over agricultural production and adhering to putting politics in command.
    It can be seen that the class struggle under new conditions revolves around the central issue of strengthening or weakening the role of the Party's leadership and the proletarian dictatorship. Since this is the case, the policy of putting politics in command put forward by the Party is even more important. Since we must implement putting politics in command in all construction undertakings, then strengthening the ideological transformation of intellectuals, emphasizing the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants, and cultivating a new type of intellectual contingent that is both red and expert, loyal to the proletarian cause and loyal to socialism, are of particularly important significance.
    Some comrades seem to think that as long as the socialist transformation of private capitalist economy and individual economy has been carried out, the socialist revolution can be considered a great success. Facts have proved that the problem is not so simple. The victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front is not the final victory of the socialist revolution. We must continue to carry out revolution and achieve victory on the political and ideological fronts in order to ensure the consolidation and development of the victory on the economic front and to enable the socialist construction cause to develop smoothly and at high speed. The Party's general line for socialist revolution and the general line for socialist construction formulated under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as the complete set of policies put forward for implementing these general lines, are undoubtedly a major development of Marxism-Leninism. History has proved and will continue to prove that the significance and influence of the Party's general line and the complete set of policies for implementing the general line, as well as the main experiences we have gained in implementing the Party's general line and these policies, will be very far-reaching. Our entire Party and the people of all nationalities across the country must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, unite under the banner of the Party's general line, and forge ahead bravely to strive for continued leaps forward and greater victories in various construction tasks in 1960.

　　大跃进中新旧两种力量的斗争
　　中共贵州省委第一书记　周林
    我国人民在党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，高举马克思列宁主义不断革命的鲜明旗帜，勇往直前，使社会主义革命步步深入，社会主义建设节节胜利。国民经济大跃进局面的出现和农村人民公社化运动的健康发展，充分证明社会主义革命和社会主义建设的密切关系。
    在这样无比广泛和深刻的革命斗争中，任何人的阶级本质都会充分地显露出来。是社会主义革命的勇士还是懦夫；是无产阶级事业的忠实同志，还是马克思主义的暂时的同路人；是党的路线的坚决卫士，还是背叛人民利益的可耻的逃兵，斗争过程都会将这一切清楚而无遗地揭示出来。
    下面举出两个典型事例，证明在社会主义建设中经常有新旧两种力量的斗争，这是在新的条件下，阶级斗争以新的形式和规律进行着的反映。这两个典型事例也证明，社会主义革命和社会主义建设绝不可分割；在社会主义建设中依然需要不断地进行社会主义革命，任何经济和文化的建设事业中，都一定会有两条道路和两条路线的斗争，都绝对需要实行政治挂帅即加强党的领导。要使社会主义革命在经济战线上所取得的胜利得到巩固和发展，还需要在政治战线和思想战线上进行社会主义革命并取得胜利。
    两个事例都发生在大跃进的浪潮中，都发生在贵州农村基层组织里，它们代表着新旧两种力量，代表着两个完全相反的方向。一个是社会主义方向，一个是资本主义方向。两个事件中的主角，一个是坚决捍卫党的总路线、捍卫社会主义事业的斗士；另一个事实证明是人民革命事业的一个暂时的同路人。
    正安县土坪人民公社，在成立不到一年的时间里，时常遭受一小撮富裕农民的攻击，特别是在今年8、9月间，他们更发出“人民公社不好”、“今不如昔”等谬论。这种进攻，激怒了广大贫农和下中农，更激怒了贫农出身的社员刘绍洲。他当场挺身而起，挥动着他那只在解放前被地主砍断的手臂，当众诉说着他的亲身经历，诉说着人民公社给他带来的好处。最后他坚定地说：“我们不能忘本，我们要永远跟着共产党走”。
    刘绍洲像千千万万的贫苦农民一样，在旧社会里受尽压榨欺凌。他租种地主的田地，终年勤劳不息，却过着牛马不如的生活，吃的是蕨巴、蕨台、树皮，穿的是“秧毡衣”，盖的是“秧毡被”。反动政府抓兵派款，逼得他家时常逃荒，住山洞。即使这样，他也逃不了难。1936年腊月三十，他家连一把年饭米也没有，地主却又来催逼租债了，并要抢去他的女儿作抵押。当时刘绍洲愤然上前阻挡，被地主一刀砍掉了右手。解放后，地主被斗倒了。刘绍洲一家的生活，一天比一天好起来，去年办起人民公社，他家的生活更好了。现在，他家有三间新瓦房，三个小孩都在学校读书，他自己给公社养猪。凭劳动收入，一家人吃穿不用愁，不仅有棉被，也有了蚊帐。像刘绍洲这样的人，只要是没有“忘本”的话，怎能不挺身起来同攻击人民公社制度、同攻击党的路线的人进行坚决的斗争呢？
    现在，刘绍洲正在公社党委、县委的领导和支持下，挑着行囊，挑着他过去的“千疤衣”“秧毡衣”“秧毡被”，带着他在解放前被地主砍掉的手臂残骨，到各地向群众讲述他自己的亲身经历，驳斥一小部分富裕农民反对社会主义的谬论。他到了遵义，到了贵阳，至少已有几万人听到了他的讲演，看到了他的新旧两种生活对照的实物展览，都受到了一次深刻的政治思想教育，坚定了自己走社会主义道路的决心。
    刘绍洲只是千千万万觉悟起来的穷苦人民中的一个。同他一样自觉地在新条件下的阶级斗争中站稳立场，为保卫党的总路线和人民公社制度，奋起反击一小部分富裕农民的进攻的人，也是成千上万的。农村中涌现出这样一批先进分子，是高举大跃进和人民公社旗帜奋勇前进的骨干力量。任何反社会主义的谬论，都被他们批驳得体无完肤。但是，在这同一个斗争的时代里，也能看到另一种现象，那就是极少数的抱着资产阶级世界观对革命不坚定的分子，在富裕农民的进攻面前，表现怯懦、动摇和没有气节，作了富裕农民意见的传声筒，甚至直接成为向党的总路线进攻的急先锋。
    差不多就在刘绍洲挺身而起反击富裕农民进攻、坚决保卫社会主义的同时，和正安县呲连的沿河县甘溪区，有一个乡长叫蒋玉昌，他带头向党向人民下了战书，提出了一整套恢复资本主义制度的纲领。他这个纲领（也就是他的建议书）很长，这里不可能全文引出，只举其中的几个主要点来谈谈就可以了。
    蒋玉昌建议书的题目是“对改建农业生产管理和商业活动的建议”。请看，他是要怎样来“改建”我们的农业和商业的。他“改建”农业生产的基本点，就是将一切生产资料，包括土地、森林、水利、基建和大型农具，“分别租管到生产户”，由各生产户按年或按作物期，向国家或集体交纳一定数额的产品。“实行各生产户经营自治，盈亏自负”。不用说，这是一个彻头彻尾的恢复单干的建议，是要把已经集体化的土地、森林、水利和农具等，重新分归各人私有。但蒋玉昌狡辩地说，他这不是主张倒退，不是主张恢复单干。至于他在“改建”农业方面的其他一些建议中，有解散集体食堂，有提倡雇工自由，有要求改变现行的分配制度等，这里就不必去说了。
    他在“改建”商业的建议中，基本点是主张“开放自由市场”，恢复私营商业。照他说，“取消一切限制、封锁，发展零购、零销商”，“既促使生产者、运输者的积极性”，又“减轻国营商业部门在购销环节上的负担”。总之，他认为恢复私商是好处无穷的。他并说，恢复私商是“发扬历史传统习惯，购销兼营、农商兼营、工商兼营”。如果照蒋玉昌的建议做去，必然是也只能是人剥削人的旧历史的重演。
    从蒋玉昌的建议书中，可以看出一个特点，就是反动纲领尽管提得极为露骨，但他不敢正面提出取消人民公社或不要走社会主义道路的话。他只是把人民公社的缺点尽量夸大，把我们工作中的毛病和困难竭力渲染，借以把自己伪装成似乎是出自为党为政府寻找解决问题的动机。这是新条件下，阶级斗争的一个新的特点，因为人民公社已得到如此广泛的群众支持，大跃进浪潮已是如此势不可挡，党的总路线已是如此深入人心，要是对人民公社、大跃进、总路线正面加以非难和反对，就会立即遭到人民群众的“迎头痛击”的。人民群众的社会主义和共产主义的觉悟更加提高了，这些人的任何花招手法都枉费心机。自出现大跃进局势以来，自建立人民公社以来，各种反社会主义的谬论，各种代表资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想的意见，已被广大群众多次地驳倒了。
    刘绍洲和蒋玉昌这两个事例，都是一定条件下阶级斗争的自然现象。不过，刘绍洲代表着农民的绝大多数，代表着农村占压倒多数的人坚决拥护社会主义的要求，而蒋玉昌则是代表富裕农民中的一小部分对社会主义改造的反抗和对资本主义制度的留恋。他们的行动都带有浓厚的阶级本色。蒋玉昌不同于刘绍洲的地方，是他出身于生活较富裕的家庭，本人原是个小知识分子，虽当过几年干部，受过党和共青团的多年教育，但他的思想没有得到改造，因而他在当前农村的阶级斗争中，成为一小部分富裕农民反抗社会主义的代表，也就不足为奇了。
    上述两个事例，又一次说明了这样一条真理：只要还存在着阶级区别，还存在着资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响，阶级斗争就不会停止。在由资本主义到社会主义的整个过渡时期，无产阶级同资产阶级的思想政治斗争是波浪式的，高一阵，低一阵，再高一阵，再低一阵。直到资产阶级的思想政治影响最后消灭为止。今年8、9月间，正是我国农村在实现人民公社化以后阶级斗争高一阵的时候，刘绍洲和蒋玉昌这两个正面和反面的代表人物，就在这个时候出现决不是偶然的。
    既然在无产阶级专政条件下，在社会主义建设时期，阶级斗争在一种新的规律和形式下进行着，那我们就没有理由不在一切建设事业中强调政治挂帅和党的领导的作用。事实上，没有任何一项建设工作不带有阶级斗争的性质和意义。甚至连技术改革这样的事，也不可能例外。近年来，我们在农村为贯彻“农业八字宪法”而进行的斗争同样说明了这一点。是些什么人阻挠“农业八字宪法”的贯彻呢？是些什么人反对深翻土地、反对合理密植和反对推广新式农具呢？考察起来，绝大多数场合是一部分富裕农民。他们反对这些，其目的是企图同党争夺农业生产的领导权。他们企图证明党和人民政府不能领导农业生产，企图证明农业生产没有党和政府的领导也能够发展。当然，党提出的“农业八字宪法”，也和其他一切政策措施一样，得到了绝大多数农民的积极拥护，并在农业生产中认真贯彻。实际情况是，近几年来我们在农业生产战线上，年复一年地获得大增产、大丰收，就是贯彻“农业八字宪法”的具体成果，也是农业技术改革方面阶级斗争的胜利成果，当然也是坚持党对农业生产的领导、坚持政治挂帅的胜利成果。
    可见，新条件下的阶级斗争，是围绕着加强或削弱党的领导和无产阶级专政制度的作用这一中心问题而展开的。既然如此，党提出的政治挂帅的方针，就更为重要了。既要在一切建设事业中实行政治挂帅，那么，加强对知识分子的思想改造，强调知识分子同工农群众相结合，以及培养一支忠于无产阶级事业、忠于社会主义的又红又专的新型知识分子队伍，就有特别重要的意义了。
    有些同志，似乎以为只要对私人资本主义经济和个体经济进行了社会主义改造，社会主义革命便算大功告成。事实证明问题并不这么简单。社会主义革命在经济战线上取得了胜利还不是社会主义革命的最后胜利，还必须在政治战线和思想战线上不断地进行革命并取得胜利，才能保证巩固和发展经济战线上的胜利，才能使社会主义建设事业顺利而高速度地向前发展。我们党在毛泽东同志领导下，所制定的社会主义革命总路线和社会主义建设总路线，以及为实行这些总路线所提出的一整套方针，无疑地是对马克思列宁主义的重大发展。历史已在证明并将继续证明，党的总路线和实行总路线的一整套方针，以及我们在贯彻党的总路线和这些方针中所取得的主要经验，其意义和影响将是非常深远的。我们全党和全国各族人民必须更紧密地团结在党中央和毛泽东同志的周围，团结在党的总路线的旗帜下，为争取1960年各项建设工作中的继续跃进和更大胜利，奋勇前进。
