    The Lifeline of Crops - Water
    Zhu Xiangyuan
    The emergence of life began with the appearance of water; without water, there would be no life to speak of. Recently, some Soviet scientists speculated that simple life might exist on the moon, one reason being the discovery of active volcanoes on the moon, which may produce water vapor during eruptions.
    Plants and water are even more closely related. A corn plant or a sunflower consumes over four hundred catties of water in its short life; a wheat plant also consumes several liters of water; for every catty of grain harvested, two hundred fifty to two thousand catties of water must first be supplied.
    Water is an important component of plant bodies. Generally, plants are composed of 90% water. Cucumbers and tomatoes are 95% water. When we buy a catty of tomatoes at the market, nine ounces and five mace of it are actually water. Even that dry tree trunk contains 40% water. All life activities of plants, such as seed germination, growth, synthesis of organic matter, and internal transport, cannot proceed without water. Water is also the "skeleton" of plants. When plants absorb enough water, their leaves stand upright; when water is lacking, the leaves wither as if their bones had been removed. Water is also the basic raw material for plants to synthesize organic matter, but it accounts for very little of the total water consumption, about 0.2%, while the remaining 99.8% is consumed in transpiration. In order to maintain a certain body temperature and not be overheated by the sun, leaves must constantly transpire water. Every gram of water transpired consumes 536 calories of heat, lowering the surface temperature of the leaves. This is like people always pouring some water in the yard on hot days to let it evaporate and lower the temperature.
    It can be seen that water is indeed the lifeline of plants. Once there is a lack of water, it will affect growth at best, and cause death at worst. Therefore, water has become the "lifeblood" in agriculture.
    For more than two thousand one hundred years, major agricultural disasters in our country have almost all occurred due to water. There have been one thousand and sixty droughts due to lack of water; there have been one thousand and thirty-one floods due to excessive water. The reason for droughts is very clear, because plants do not get enough water. What about floods? Is it because excessive water swells and damages the plants? No, it is also because the plants die from lack of water. Originally, plants absorb water through the life activities of their roots. For life activities to proceed normally, there must be sufficient oxygen. After a flood, long-term water accumulation in the fields prevents the roots of crops from getting oxygen, thus affecting their life activities and preventing them from absorbing water. Despite the vast expanse of water, crops can only sigh in despair and wither to death. Someone asked: Why can rice grow in water? In fact, rice also needs oxygen to carry out life activities, but its leaves can absorb oxygen and transport it to the roots, so rice will also die if it is submerged too much.

    庄稼的命根子——水
    朱相远
    生命的产生，就是从出现了水以后才开始的，没有水就根本谈不上有什么生命。最近有些苏联科学家推测月球上也可能生活着简单的生命，其中有一个理由，就是发现月球上有活火山，爆发时可能产生水汽。
    植物与水，更是休戚相关。一棵玉米或一株向日葵，在短短的一生中，就要消耗四百多斤水；一棵小麦也要消耗好几升水；每收到一斤粮食，就要先供给二百五十斤到两千斤水。
    水是植物体内的重要组成部分。一般植物体中有九成是水。黄瓜和西红柿有95％是水。我们到市场上买到一斤西红柿，其实里面有九两五钱水。就是那干巴巴的树干，里面也含有四成水。植物的一切生命活动，如种子萌发、生长、有机物质的合成，和体内的运输等等，没有一样可以离开水而进行。水还是植物的“骨头”。植物吸足了水分，叶子就能挺挺的；缺少水，就好像抽了骨头似的，叶子便会萎缩起来。水还是植物合成有机物的基本原料，但它在整个水分消耗中所占极少，约0.2％，其余99.8％的水都消耗在蒸腾上。叶子为了保持一定体温，不致被晒得过热，就要不断蒸腾水分。每蒸腾一克水，就要耗费五百三十六卡热量，使叶子表面温度降低。这就好像在大热天里人们总爱在院子里泼上些水，让它蒸发来降低气温一样。
    由此可见，水确是植物的命根子，一旦缺水，轻则影响生长，重则死亡。因此水在农业中也就成为“命脉”了。
    两千一百多年来，我国农业上的重大灾荒，几乎都是由于水而发生的。因水少而旱的旱灾有一千零六十次；因水多而涝的水灾有一千零三十一次。旱灾，道理很明白，因为植物得不到足够的水分。水灾呢？是不是因水过多而胀坏了植物呢？不是的，同样是因为植物缺水而枯死。原来，植物吸水是靠根的生命活动，若要生命活动正常进行，就必需有充分的氧气。发生涝灾后，田里长期积水，就使作物根部得不到氧气，因此影响了生命活动，也就吸不进水去。尽管一片汪洋，作物也只好望洋兴叹，枯萎而死。有人问：水稻为什么就能生长在水里呢？其实水稻也要靠氧气来进行生命活动，只不过它的叶子能吸收氧气，再把氧气运到根部，所以水稻若被淹过了头，也是活不成的。
