    Grasp Ideology First When Promoting Production; Grasp Politics First When Promoting Technology
    The CCP Changzhou Municipal Committee Adopted This Leadership Method, Expanding the Number of Advanced Factories in the City from Forty-Five to Seventy, and Doubling the Number of Advanced Workshops and Teams
    (Our newspaper, Changzhou, 5th dispatch) Since the in-depth development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the industrial front in Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, has seen ideology and production forming two huge waves, surging forward one after another. At present, the number of advanced factories in the city has increased from the original 45 to 70; advanced workshops have increased from 64 to 188; advanced teams have increased from 163 to 554; and advanced workers have increased from 1,741 to 4,438. The expansion of the advanced ranks has greatly shortened the differences between the advanced, the intermediate, and the backward, raising the city's industrial production to a new level.
    In the in-depth development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the CCP Changzhou Municipal Committee used the leadership method of identifying differences and making comparisons, finding the factors of advancement from the differences between the advanced and the backward, and finding out the reasons for backwardness, so as to more purposefully help the backward catch up with the advanced and encourage the advanced to continuously improve. However, in identifying the differences between the advanced and the backward, a common rule was discovered: advanced units are first and foremost ideologically advanced. They are full of energy, full of confidence, unafraid of difficulties, and forge ahead courageously. The backward units, on the other hand, mainly do a poor job in ideological work. They either emphasize difficulties, are content to be in the middle, not seeking to improve, or are arrogant and complacent, standing still. In order to narrow this difference and continuously expand the ranks of the advanced, the Municipal Committee firmly grasped the link of ideological work, using anti-rightism and boosting morale as the driving force, requiring all units to grasp ideology first before comparing production.
    The iron smelting workshop of the Changzhou Iron and Steel Plant was one of the earliest units built in the city and had the strongest technical force. However, the production of this workshop was once the worst in the city. The leading cadres of the workshop always believed that the workers were mostly new, "lacking both technology and operational experience." Therefore, they did not consult with the workers when they encountered difficulties, and they believed that there was nothing worth learning from the advanced experience of brother factories. As for the experience of large factories, they said that their equipment and technical conditions were poor and "could not afford to climb so high." This time, the Municipal Committee organized the Guanghua Iron and Steel Plant, which was smaller in scale, had poorer conditions, but had very advanced indicators, to compare with them. In comparison, the cadres of the iron smelting workshop of Changgang were finally convinced. Then, using the Guanghua Plant as a mirror, they thoroughly criticized their erroneous thinking of not believing in the masses, changed their leadership style, and finally overcame the long-standing production key, and all major indicators rose linearly, and comprehensively surpassed the Guanghua Iron and Steel Plant, becoming a red flag in the city's iron smelting units.
    After some originally backward factories jumped to become advanced units, some factories in the middle state were greatly shocked. The Dacheng No. 1 Factory was a "middle-level" factory among the five cotton spinning factories in the city. The cadres of this factory always believed that they were "not as good as the best, but better than the rest." They were not convinced by the advanced and looked down on the backward. In this big competition, the Minfeng Factory, which was originally behind it, saw its production soar, and a large number of high-quality yarns appeared continuously. Seeing that it was about to catch up with the Dacheng No. 1 Factory, Dacheng No. 1 Factory was greatly surprised and began to realize that the situation was pressing and the "middle level" could not be maintained for long. The factory Party committee immediately criticized the cadres' thinking of settling for the "middle level," went out the door to learn advanced experience from brother factories, and organized all factory workers to carry out technological innovation to solve production keys. As a result, the decline in cotton yarn quality was quickly reversed, and it won the championship in the factory competition.
    Through the big competition, the always advanced red flag units were also greatly promoted. The Changzhou Color Weaving Factory won the red flag every month in the competition of the city's 23 weaving factories, and always ranked first. This advantage once made the factory's leading cadres produce arrogance and complacency. They looked down on the Jiuhua Cloth Factory, which was linked to them in the competition, saying, "The Jiuhua Cloth Factory is always backward, and it is sure to be easily defeated." As a result, production has not increased significantly. However, the Jiuhua Cloth Factory, which was called "always backward," was working hard to catch up and surpass, and completed the production plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it. This fact was an extremely profound education for the Changzhou Color Weaving Factory. After the Municipal Committee announced the production comparison table of the two factories, the director of the Color Weaving Factory immediately made a self-criticism to all factory workers, examined the arrogance and complacency, and immediately organized workers to go to the Jiuhua Factory to study. Then, it comprehensively surpassed the Jiuhua Factory again and maintained the honor of being advanced.
    This big production competition has given the city's production outlook a new look. The backward have become advanced, the intermediate have kept up closely, and the advanced have become more advanced, thus making the advanced ranks of the city's industrial front increasingly expanded.

    抓生产先抓思想  抓技术先抓政治
    中共常州市委采取这种领导方法，使全市先进厂由四十五个扩大到七十个，先进车间和小组增加两倍
    本报常州5日电　江苏省常州市工业战线在深入开展增产节约运动以来，思想与生产形成两股巨浪，前涌后推，滚滚前进。目前全市先进工厂由原来的四十五家扩大到七十家；先进车间由六十四个扩大到一百八十八个；先进小组由一百六十三个扩大到五百五十四个；先进工人由一千七百四十一人扩大到四千四百三十八人。先进队伍的扩大，大大缩短了先进、中间、落后三者之间的差异，使全市工业生产提到了一个新的水平。
    在深入开展增产节约运动中，中共常州市委运用了排差异、抓对比的领导方法，从先进与落后的差异中，找出先进的因素，查出落后的原因，以便更有目的地帮助落后赶上先进，鼓励先进不断向上。但在排先进与落后的差异中，发现了一个共同的规律：凡是先进的单位首先是思想先进，他们干劲十足，信心百倍，不怕困难，勇往直前。而落后的单位主要是思想工作做得差，他们或者是强调困难；或者是甘居中游，不求上进；或者是骄傲自满，踏步不前。为了缩小这种差异，不断地扩大先进队伍，市委紧紧抓住了思想工作这一环，以反右倾，鼓干劲为动力，要求各单位比生产首先要抓思想。
    常州钢铁厂的炼铁车间是全市兴建最早、技术力量最强的一个单位。但是这个车间的生产，一度却是全市最差的，车间的领导干部总认为工人大都是新手，“既没有技术，又缺乏操作经验”；因此有困难也不去和工人商量，而对待兄弟厂的先进经验，又认为小厂没有什么值得学习的；对大厂的经验，却又说自己的设备技术条件差，“高攀不上”。这次市委组织了规模较小，条件较差，而各项指标都很先进的广化钢铁厂和他们对比。相比之下，常钢炼铁车间的干部这才口服心服。接着便以广化厂为镜子，彻底地批判了自己不相信群众的错误思想，转变了领导作风，终于克服了长期来一直没有解决的生产关键，各项主要指标直线上升，并全面超过了广化钢铁厂，成为全市炼铁单位中的一面红旗。
    一些原来落后的工厂一跃而为先进单位后，一部分处于中游状态的工厂引起了很大震动。大成一厂是全市五家棉纺厂中的“中游”厂。这个厂的干部一向认为自己是“比上不足，比下有余”，他们对先进的不服气，对落后的看不起。在这次大比大赛中，原来比他落后的民丰厂生产扶摇直上，连续出现了成批的优质纱，眼看就要赶上大成一厂，这才使大成一厂大吃一惊，开始意识到形势逼人，“中游”不可久居。工厂党委立即批判了干部中的安居“中游”思想，一面跨出门槛，向兄弟厂学习先进经验，一面组织全厂职工开展技术革新，解决生产关键，因而棉纱质量下降的情况很快得到了扭转，而且夺得了厂际竞赛的冠军。
    通过大比大赛，对一向先进的红旗单位也是一大促进。常州色织布厂在全市二十三家织布厂的竞赛中，月月夺得红旗，始终名列冠军。这种优势，曾使工厂领导干部产生了骄傲自满情绪。他们瞧不起与他们挂钩竞赛的久华布厂，说：“久华布厂是老落后，笃定稳吃。”结果，生产一直没有大幅度的增长。可是，被称为“老落后”的久华布厂，却在鼓足干劲，猛赶直追，提前超额完成了生产计划。这个事实对常州色织布厂是一个极其深刻的教育。市委把他们两个厂的生产对比表公布以后，色织布厂的厂长立刻向全厂职工作了自我批评，检查了骄傲自满情绪，并立刻组织工人到久华厂去学习。接着又全面地赶在久华厂的前面，保持了先进的荣誉。
    这一场生产上的大比大赛，使全市的生产面貌焕然一新。落后的变为先进，中间的紧紧跟上，先进的更加先进，因而使全市工业战线的先进队伍日益扩大。
