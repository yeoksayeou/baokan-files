    Enhancing the Combat Effectiveness of Rural Party Branches
    Zhang Tao
    Recently, the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committees convened working conferences for model production team Party branches in the people's communes. This further implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, enabling the cadres present to further clarify the direction of progress, summarize and exchange advanced experiences, and launch a vigorous revolutionary emulation movement of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced, and helping the backward" throughout the province. This is a good method worthy of promotion.
    The Party branch of a production team in a people's commune is the Party's fighting fortress in the countryside, the leadership core of the production team, and the link and bridge between the Party and the broad masses of commune members. Whether the Party's policies can be implemented, whether the commune's production plans and work tasks can be completed, and whether the opinions and demands of the broad masses of commune members can be promptly reflected, all depend on whether the production team's Party branch can play its due role. Judging from the current situation of the production team Party branches, the vast majority of Party branches have a clear direction and strong combat effectiveness, and also have relatively rich leadership and work experience. They have played a core leadership role in implementing the Party's policies and organizing the great leap in production. According to statistics, such production team Party branches account for more than 80% in Zhejiang Province. However, there are also a few production team Party branches with relatively low leadership levels and insufficient work experience, which cannot fully play their due role on the front lines of rural socialism. Therefore, the leadership responsibility of Party committees at all levels is to regularly take various measures to help those backward branches improve rapidly, and at the same time, to help advanced branches adapt to the new situation of rural development and continue to move forward.
    How can we rapidly improve the leadership level and combat effectiveness of rural Party branches and give full play to their role as fighting fortresses? Party committees at all levels in Zhejiang Province have adopted some very good practices. They help advanced branches summarize their experiences, widely promote these experiences, grasp the advanced, establish models, and carry out the "learn, catch up, surpass, and help" emulation movement. In a word, vigorously carry out the emulation movement of rural Party branch work. And convening working conferences for model production team Party branches organically combines the mass line working methods of summarizing and exchanging experiences from the bottom up, on-site meetings, visits and comparisons, establishing advanced models, and carrying out mass revolutionary emulation movements. This approach is correct. Doing so can enable the experiences of advanced Party branches to be summarized and improved, and the scattered experiences to be concentrated into more comprehensive experiences; it can enable the vast number of rural Party branches to have "models" to learn from, which everyone can see and deeply understand. After seeing the experiences of others, they immediately relate them to their own situations and improve their own work; it can also stimulate the revolutionary enterprising spirit of rural Party branches and Party members to strive for the top, chase each other, with the front waves pushing the back waves, constantly revolutionizing, and constantly improving. As a result, all rural Party branches can be rapidly and universally raised to the level of advanced Party branches, better implement the Party's general line, and become the Party's strong fighting core fortresses in the countryside.

    提高农村党支部战斗力
    张涛
    最近，中共浙江省各地委召开了人民公社标兵生产队党支部工作会议。进一步贯彻了党的八届八中全会的精神，使到会干部进一步明确了前进方向，总结交流了先进经验，在全省范围内轰轰烈烈地展开了“学先进，赶先进，超先进，帮后进”的革命竞赛运动。这是一项值得推广的好方法。
    人民公社生产队的党支部是党在农村中的战斗堡垒，是生产队的领导核心，是党联系广大社员群众的纽带和桥梁。党的方针政策能否贯彻执行，公社的生产计划和工作任务能否完成，广大社员群众的意见和要求能否及时反映上来，都要看生产队党支部是否能发挥它应有的作用。从现在生产队党支部的情况看来，绝大部分的党支部方向明确，有坚强的战斗力，也有比较丰富的领导经验和工作经验，它们在贯彻执行党的方针政策和组织生产大跃进中，起了核心领导作用。据统计，浙江省这样的生产队的党支部占80％以上。但是也有少数生产队的党支部，领导水平比较低，工作经验不够多，在农村社会主义前哨阵地上，还不能充分发挥它们应有的作用。因此，各级党委的领导责任，就是要经常地采取各种措施帮助那些后进的支部迅速提高，同时也要帮助先进的支部适应农村发展的新形势不断前进。
    怎样才能迅速地提高农村党支部的领导水平和战斗力，充分发挥它们的战斗堡垒的作用呢？浙江省各级党委采取了一些很好的做法。他们帮助先进支部总结经验，广泛地推广这些经验，抓先进、立标兵，开展“学、赶、超、帮”的竞赛运动。一句话，大搞农村党支部工作的竞赛运动。而召开标兵生产队党支部工作会议，就把自下而上地总结交流经验、现场会议、参观评比、树先进、立标兵、开展群众性革命竞赛运动等群众路线的工作方法有机地结合起来了。这种做法是正确的。这样做，可以使先进党支部的经验得到总结提高，使分散的经验集中成为比较全面的经验；可以使广大农村党支部有“样子”可学，大家看得见，体会深，看了别人的经验，马上联系自己的情况，改进自己的工作；还可以激发农村党支部和党员的力争上游的革命进取心，你追我赶，前浪推后浪，不断革命，不断提高。这样做的结果，就可以迅速普遍地把所有农村党支部提高到先进党支部的水平上来，更好地贯彻执行党的总路线，成为党在农村中的坚强的战斗核心堡垒。
