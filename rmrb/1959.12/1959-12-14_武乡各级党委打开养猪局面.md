Wu Xiang Levels of Party Committees Open Up Pig Farming Situation

(Reported by this newspaper) Over the past ten months, pig farming in Wu Xiang County, Shanxi Province, has seen rapid development. The county's pig population has increased from over 30,000 head in January this year, averaging 0.7 head per household, to over 100,000 head in November (over 86,000 head in pens), averaging 2.3 head per household, a 150% increase compared to last year, ranking first in Shanxi Province.

The development of pig farming has brought many benefits to production and life. First, it has added a large quantity of high-quality fertilizer. Last year, the county's average fertilizer application was 70 dan per mu; this year, it reached 110 dan per mu, with pig manure accounting for 14% of the total fertilizer. Due to the increase in fertilizer, despite severe disasters such as drought, hail, wind, and pests this year, the county's grain yield per mu still increased by more than 20 jin compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, averaging over 240 jin per mu. Second, it supported the city's need for pork and increased the income of the masses. From January to October, the county sold a total of 14,974 fat pigs, with the income accounting for 8.9% of the total agricultural income. This alone brought an average income of 18 yuan per household in the county. Due to the increase in income, about 40 management districts in the county have changed their impoverished conditions, more than 4,000 households with perennial debts have become depositors this year, and more than 6,000 households have become self-sufficient.

Wu Xiang has abundant land (averaging nearly four mu per person) but lacks fertilizer, relying mainly on natural fertilizer. This year, when the county committee deployed production increase measures, it decided to vigorously promote pig farming for fertilizer accumulation. However, some ideological obstacles were encountered among cadres and the masses. Some people opposed pig farming to production, believing that "production is so busy, how can we take care of pig farming?" Some people lacked confidence in pig farming because they had no habit of raising pigs, and thought that the sources of pigs and feed were difficult. In order to break these ideological obstacles, the Wu Xiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specifically instructed the county party secretary to be the group leader, the county magistrate to be the deputy group leader, and absorbed the heads of relevant units such as the Minister of Agriculture and Industry, Director of Agricultural Construction Bureau, Director of Commerce Bureau, Bank President, Communist Youth League Secretary, and Women's Federation Director to form a pig development guidance group, established a special office, regularly studied the situation, promptly solved problems, and vigorously promoted pig farming experience. It also designated communes, management districts, and production teams, with secretaries at each level as group leaders, to organize pig development guidance groups at all levels. At the same time, it organized more than ten large and medium-sized on-site meetings throughout the county, fully exchanging advanced experiences in pig farming in various places, commended 44 advanced pig farming units, and established more than 300 pig farming pacesetters. Each on-site meeting was also turned into a mutual exchange and adjustment meeting, adjusting more than 3,000 sows, more than 1,000 breeding pigs, more than 20,000 piglets, and more than 20 pig doctors. The county and communes also took out about 100,000 yuan in cash to help management districts establish pig farms; management districts also took out a certain amount of funds to support members in raising pigs, and mobilized members to adjust among themselves to overcome difficulties such as insufficient funds.

High-speed development of pig farming must adhere to the principle of "walking on two legs." Wu Xiang County learned from past lessons and paid attention to collective breeding as the main method and combining public and private breeding from the beginning of this year's pig farming. In 1957, because only members' individual pig farming was emphasized and collective pig farming was neglected, the county had only more than 10,000 pigs in a year; in 1958, only public breeding was emphasized and members' private breeding was not valued, although pig farming developed, it totaled only more than 30,000 heads. This year, Wu Xiang County first established county, commune, management district, and production team (canteen) collective pig farms, based on the long-term plan of growing from small to large and from simple to complex, and established 775 large and medium-sized pig farms, with collective pig farming reaching 53,320 heads, accounting for 62% of the county's total pig population. At the same time, it mobilized members to raise pigs, and the commune and management district pig farms guaranteed the supply of pigs to members; they also left a certain amount of time for pig-raising households to feed pigs and collect feed every day. The commune and management district pig doctors signed contracts with members, responsible for treating privately raised sick pigs. Due to the strong support from the county, communes, and districts, members raised a total of 32,680 pigs, accounting for 38% of the county's total pig population.

The rapid development of pigs from small quantities to large quantities brought new problems such as feeding management, feed sources, and prevention of swine fever. Communes and management districts selected feeders who loved pig farming, had preliminary feeding experience, and were politically reliable, and organized professional feeding teams; they implemented classified management according to the size, male and female of the pigs, and fed them in separate troughs, ensuring that every pig had a pen and every pen had cold-proof, heat-proof, and wolf-proof facilities. At the same time, they implemented the "seven fixings" method for feeding: fixing tasks, fixing investment, fixing work points, fixing personnel, fixing reproduction, fixing meat growth, and fixing fertilizer accumulation, and determined the remuneration and rewards for feeders. Reasonable fat prices were also stipulated for members' pig farming. In this way, the responsibility of the feeders and the enthusiasm of the members were greatly strengthened. On the issue of feed, in addition to retaining a part of the concentrated feed, according to the plan, one point of feed land was reserved for each pig, and the communes were vigorously mobilized to carry out wild vegetable collection activities, and all substitute feeds such as grain husks, corn cobs, and yam vines were used to ensure that pigs had sufficient feed. In order to ensure that pigs were strong and healthy, the county and communes trained more than 1,500 pig doctors and epidemic prevention workers in batches; relying on this backbone force, using the method of contracting and responsibility, they helped the pig farms and member households of the communes, management districts, and production teams to cultivate a large number of "native doctors," basically ensuring that where there were pigs, there were pig doctors; they also regularly inspected and injected pigs for prevention.

Currently, Wu Xiang County is building on the momentum of more than doubling the number of pigs this year compared to last year and is determined to develop the county's pig population to 260,000 heads next year, achieving the goal of two heads per person and half a head per mu of grain land. In order to achieve this goal, the county has begun to solve problems such as pig sources, feed, and the reform of pig farming tools.

### 武乡各级党委打开养猪局面

    层层建立指导组时时召开现场会
    生猪猛增七万头  跃居山西第一位
    武乡各级党委打开养猪局面
    本报讯　十个多月来，山西省武乡县的养猪事业出现了高速度发展的局面。全县养猪数量由今年1月份的三万多头、平均每户零点七头，发展到11月份的十万余头（圈存猪八万六千多头）、平均每户二点三头，比去年增长一倍半，跃居山西省第一位。
    养猪事业的发展，给生产和生活带来了不少的好处。首先，增添了数量多、质量好的肥料。去年全县每亩平均施肥七十担，今年每亩施肥达到一百一十担，猪肥占到整个肥料的14％。由于肥料的增加，今年在旱、雹、风、虫等严重灾害的情况下，全县粮食亩产量比大跃进的1958年还增加了二十多斤，每亩平均达到二百四十多斤。其次，支援了城市对肉猪的需要，也增加了群众收入。1至10月份，全县共卖膘猪一万四千九百七十四头，收入达到农业总收入的8.9％。仅这一项，全县每户平均就收入了十八元。由于收入增加，全县约有四十多个管理区改变了贫困面貌，四千多户连年欠款今年变成了存款户，六千多户变成了自给户。
    武乡土地多（每人平均近四亩地），肥料缺，一向以自然肥为主。今年县委在部署增产措施时，决定大力养猪积肥。但是，在干部和群众中遇到了一些思想障碍。有些人把养猪和生产对立起来，认为“生产这样忙，哪能顾上养猪”。有些群众因为没有养猪习惯，认为猪源和饲料很困难，缺乏养猪的信心。为了打破这些思想障碍，中共武乡县委会专门责成县委书记为组长，县长为副组长，吸收农工部长、农建局长、商业局长、银行行长、共青团书记、妇联主任等有关单位的负责人，组成生猪发展指导组，设立了专门办公室，定期研究情况，及时解决问题，大力推广养猪经验。并指定公社、管理区、生产队，由层层书记为组长，组织各级生猪发展指导组。同时在全县范围内组织了大中型现场会十多次，充分地交流了各地养猪的先进经验，表扬了养猪先进单位四十四个，树立了养猪标兵三百多个。还把每次现场会变成互通有无的调剂会，共调剂了母猪三千多头、种猪一千多头、小猪两万头和猪医生二十多名。县和公社又拿出了约十万元的现款，帮助管理区建立了猪场；管理区也拿出了一定的款项扶助社员养猪，并发动社员之间互相调剂，克服资金不足等困难。
    高速度发展养猪，必须坚持“两条腿走路”的方针。武乡县接受了过去的教训，今年养猪一开始就注意了以集体饲养为主，公养和私养并举。1957年由于只重视社员个人养猪，忽视集体养猪，结果全县一年仅有生猪一万多头；1958年光强调了公养，又不重视社员私养，生猪虽然有发展，但总共也只有三万多头。今年，武乡县首先大办县、公社、管理区、生产队（食堂）集体养猪场，根据由小到大由简到繁的长远打算，共建立了大、中型猪场七百七十五个，集体养猪达到五万三千三百二十头，占全县养猪总数的62％。同时发动社员养猪，公社和管理区的猪场保证供给社员猪源；每天还给养猪户留下一定的时间喂猪和采集饲料。公社、管理区的猪医生和社员订有合同，负责治疗私养病猪。由于县、社、区的大力扶持，社员养猪共达三万二千六百八十头，占全县生猪总数的38％。
    全县生猪由小量迅速向大量发展，带来了饲养管理、饲料来源和防治猪瘟等新问题。公社和管理区挑选了热爱养猪事业、有初步喂养经验和政治可靠的饲养员，组织了专业饲养队伍；按照猪的大小、公母，实行了分类管理，分槽喂养，作到了猪猪有圈、圈圈有防冷、防热、防狼设备。同时对饲养实行定任务、定投资、定工分、定人员、定繁殖、定长肉、定积肥的“七定”的办法和确定了对饲养员的报酬与奖励。对社员养猪，也合理规定了肥价。这样，就大大加强了饲养员的责任心和社员的积极性。在饲料问题上，除留了一部分精饲料外，根据计划，每头猪留了一分饲料地，并大力发动各公社开展采集野菜运动，又把谷糠、玉米轴、山药蔓等代饲料全部利用起来，保证了生猪有足够的饲料。为了保证生猪健壮，县和公社分期分批训练了一千五百多名猪医生和防疫员；依靠这支骨干力量，用包干负责的方法，帮助公社、管理区、生产队的猪场和社员户，培养了大批“土医生”，基本上作到了那里有猪，那里就有猪医生；对生猪还定时进行检查，注射预防。
    目前，武乡县正在今年生猪比去年翻了一番多的基础上乘胜前进，确定明年全县生猪发展到二十六万头，实现每人两头、每亩粮田半头的指标。为了实现这个指标，全县已着手解决猪源、饲料、养猪工具改革等问题。
