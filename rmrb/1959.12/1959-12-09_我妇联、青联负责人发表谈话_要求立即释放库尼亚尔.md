    ACWF and ACYF Leaders Issue Statements
    Demanding Immediate Release of Cunhal

    Xinhua News Agency, December 8th – The person in charge of the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) today issued a statement demanding that the Portuguese authorities release Álvaro Cunhal, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, and all Portuguese patriots who have been unreasonably imprisoned. The person in charge of the ACWF said: “Chinese women are extremely indignant at the brutal persecution by the Portuguese Salazar dictatorial government of Álvaro Cunhal, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, and other patriots who are actively fighting for the cause of peace and justice."

    "In order to seek glory through national betrayal and turn Portugal into a dependency of U.S. imperialism, and in order to save its crumbling fascist rule, the Portuguese dictatorial government has gone so far as to desperately persecute the people, attempting to keep the Portuguese people and women living in humiliation and without rights for a long time. But this cannot but arouse strong resistance from the Portuguese people, who are actively engaged in the struggle against dictatorial rule and for democracy and freedom. In this struggle, the Portuguese Communist Party has always stood at the forefront, and therefore has become a thorn in the side of the reactionary Salazar government."

    The person in charge of the ACWF said that the Portuguese dictatorial government arrested Álvaro Cunhal, a revolutionary leader deeply loved by the masses, in 1949, and unreasonably extended his sentence again and again, so that he is still in prison, having been imprisoned for as long as ten years. She said: "This barbaric act of the Portuguese dictatorial government has aroused widespread protests and condemnations from the Portuguese people and the people of the world. Chinese women, together with the Chinese people, express deep sympathy and concern for the Portuguese people's opposition to the tyranny of the Portuguese dictatorial government, which colludes with U.S. imperialism. In order to uphold justice and protect human rights, we firmly demand that the reactionary Portuguese government release Cunhal and all Portuguese patriots."

    Xinhua News Agency, December 8th – The person in charge of the All-China Youth Federation (ACYF) today issued a statement saying that Chinese youth express great anger and stern protest against the Portuguese fascist authorities' repeated and shameless persecution of Álvaro Cunhal, the unyielding fighter for peace and justice in Portugal and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party. Chinese youth firmly support the powerful movement of the Portuguese people to save Cunhal and other patriots.

    The person in charge said that in order to maintain its precarious rule, the reactionary Portuguese authorities are intensifying their frantic persecution of the Portuguese people, especially the most loyal defenders of the Portuguese people's interests - the Portuguese Communist Party. However, repression will only arouse greater resistance from the people. The tide of the Portuguese people's patriotic and democratic movement has swept the country, and if the fascist rulers of Portugal continue to be obsessed with their own ways, they will surely be submerged in the huge waves of the people's movement. He said: "Today's era is the era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind. The forces of peace, democracy, and progress have far surpassed imperialism and all reactionary forces. Final victory will surely belong to the Portuguese people who are bravely fighting against dictatorial rule!"

    The person in charge said: "Currently, the Portuguese authorities are plotting to continue persecuting Comrade Cunhal. We, 130 million Chinese youth, firmly stand with the Portuguese people and youth, demanding that the Portuguese authorities stop persecuting Cunhal and other patriotic and democratic人士 and immediately restore their freedom."

    我妇联、青联负责人发表谈话
    要求立即释放库尼亚尔
    新华社8日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会负责人今天发表谈话，要求葡萄牙当局释放被无理监禁在监狱里的葡萄牙共产党中央委员会书记阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔和葡萄牙的一切爱国者。全国妇联负责人说：“中国妇女对于葡萄牙萨拉查独裁政府残酷迫害为和平与正义事业而积极斗争的杰出战士、葡萄牙共产党中央委员会书记阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔和其他爱国人士感到极大的愤慨。
    “葡萄牙独裁政府为了卖国求荣，使葡萄牙沦为美帝国主义的附庸，为了挽救其摇摇欲坠的法西斯统治，竟不惜孤注一掷地对人民进行疯狂迫害，企图使葡萄牙人民和妇女长期过着屈辱和无权的生活。但是这不能不引起葡萄牙人民的强烈反抗，积极进行反对独裁统治和争取民主、自由的斗争，在这一斗争中，葡萄牙共产党始终是站在最前列，因而成为反动的萨拉查政府的眼中钉。”
    全国妇联负责人说，葡萄牙独裁政府于1949年逮捕了深受群众爱戴的革命领袖阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔，并且竟毫无理由地一再延长他的刑期，使他至今仍身陷囹圄，竟被监禁达十年之久。她说：“葡萄牙独裁政府的这种野蛮暴行，引起了葡萄牙人民和全世界人民的普遍抗议和谴责。中国妇女和中国人民一道，对葡萄牙人民反对和美帝国主义狼狈为奸的葡萄牙独裁政府的暴政表示深切的同情和关怀。为了伸张正义和保障人权，我们坚决要求葡萄牙反动政府释放库尼亚尔和葡萄牙的一切爱国者。”
    新华社8日讯　中华全国青年联合会负责人今天发表谈话说，中国青年对葡萄牙法西斯当局一再无耻地迫害葡萄牙和平正义事业坚贞不屈的战士、葡萄牙共产党中央委员会书记阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔，表示极大的愤怒和严正的抗议。中国青年坚决支持葡萄牙人民拯救库尼亚尔和其他爱国人士的强大运动。
    负责人说，葡萄牙反动当局为了维持它风雨飘摇的统治，加紧对葡萄牙人民特别是葡萄牙人民利益最忠实的捍卫者——葡萄牙共产党进行疯狂的迫害。但是，镇压只会引起人民更大的反抗。葡萄牙人民爱国民主运动的浪潮已席卷全国，葡萄牙的法西斯统治者们如果继续执迷不悟，就一定要被淹没于人民运动的巨浪之中。他说：“今天的时代是东风压倒西风的时代，和平、民主、进步力量已大大超过帝国主义和一切反动力量，最后的胜利一定属于为反对独裁统治而英勇斗争的葡萄牙人民！”
    负责人说：“目前，葡萄牙当局正阴谋继续迫害库尼亚尔同志，我们一亿三千万中国青年坚决同葡萄牙人民和青年站在一起，要求葡萄牙当局停止对库尼亚尔及其他爱国民主人士的迫害并立即恢复他们的自由”。
