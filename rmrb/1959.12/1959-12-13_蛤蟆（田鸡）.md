    Frog (Field Chicken)
    Frogs from Changbai Mountain are relatively large, with well-developed hind legs, and the meat is crisp and delicious. In particular, the female frog contains fatty bodies in its fallopian tubes, which, when dried, become frog oil.
    Frog oil (field chicken oil) is a tonic medicinal material for treating physical weakness and neurasthenia. Approximately fifty or sixty frogs can yield one catty of oil. Frogs caught between White Dew and Frost's Descent have large, bright yellow oil lumps and are of the best quality. The Tonghua area produces one to two million field chickens annually, which are sold at home and abroad. Now (September to November) is the season for catching field chickens, as they begin to move from land to shallow water in preparation for winter. Farmers use willow branches to weave baskets and place them in the water with the opening facing upwards, containing bait inside, and the field chickens automatically crawl into the baskets. They can also be caught by going into the water and turning over stones. During the peak season, they can also be lured with lights along the riverbanks.

     蛤蟆（田鸡）
    长白山产蛤蟆，体较长大，后肢发达，肉脆嫩可口。特别是雌性蛤蟆，输卵管中含的脂肪体，干燥后即为蛤蟆油。
    蛤蟆油（田鸡油）是治身体虚弱，神经衰弱的滋补药材。大约五、六十只蛤蟆可出油一斤。在白露到霜降期间捕取的蛤蟆，油块大，色黄亮，质量最好。通化专区各县每年产田鸡一百至二百万只，行销国内外。现在（9到11月）正是捕捉田鸡季节，这时田鸡开始自陆地移往浅水，准备越冬，农民们用柳条编筐放水中，口向上，内装食饵，田鸡就自动钻到筐里；也可以下水掀动石缝捉。盛产期，在河沿两旁用灯光也可以诱捕。
