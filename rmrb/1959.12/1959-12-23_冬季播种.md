　　Winter Sowing
    Soviet Union A. Smirnyagina
    Two Soviet inventors have broken with thousands of years of agricultural tradition, creating a new method of winter sowing and manufacturing winter sowing machines. This is a bold technological innovation in agriculture.
    Winter sowing has the following advantages: ① It is one of the best methods of drought resistance. Sowing in frozen soil ensures a good harvest regardless of rainfall; ② It is a good method of combating weeds; ③ The sowing time can be extended from the original few days to several months, thus making full use of various agricultural machinery and manpower; ④ Winter-sown crops mature much earlier than general spring-sown crops; ⑤ Winter-sown crops, because seeds develop earlier, decouple the occurrence of pests and diseases from the crop growth stage, thus almost completely avoiding pest and disease infestation.
    This sowing method, after testing, has achieved great results everywhere, and various winter-sown crops have greatly increased production, with yields as high as 50% to 100%.
    In December, the Soviet Union's land is already covered with ice and snow, and it is rare to see people in the fields. All farming activities have ceased, and the agricultural off-season has arrived. However, on a state-owned farm near Moscow, there is a tractor slowly moving, pulling a sowing machine. As the tractor moves forward, rows of neat black furrows appear in the snow-covered fields... If you ask the staff present what is going on, they will smile and tell you, "Winter sowing!"
    Winter sowing is a bold technological innovation in agriculture, initiated by Sergei Vasilyevich Krylov, Deputy Doctor of Agricultural Sciences of the Soviet Union, and design engineer Nikolai Manuilovich Volf.
    These two innovators have been experimenting with sowing on frozen soil for five years. Initially, their experimental fields were located at the Vegetable Experiment Station affiliated to the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, working under the leadership of Vitaly Ivanovich Edelstein, Honorary Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a famous Soviet scientist. Now, winter sowing has large-scale experimental fields at the Gorky Second Farm near Moscow and some farms distributed in different climatic regions of the Soviet Union.
    This unusual sowing method has achieved amazing results everywhere: seeds sown in frozen soil germinate evenly and densely, crops mature three or four weeks earlier than usual, and yields are 50% to 100% higher.
    This is not only an unusual sowing method, but also a brand-new cultivation method. Sowing seeds in frozen soil, aren't you afraid of ruining them? Isn't this against the laws of nature? No, the seeds of crops' ancestors—wild plants—remain in the soil all winter. Humans taking the seeds from the fields and putting them in granaries is precisely against the laws of nature. Everyone must have seen this phenomenon: once spring arrives, weeds that have successfully overwintered in the soil often take the lead, overwhelming the shy seedlings of spring-sown crops. This is for a reason: weed seeds are preparing for development all winter long. They have endured all kinds of harsh natural conditions and have been tempered by difficult environments, making them stronger and more robust.
    It is well known that autumn-sown crops also need to overwinter in the soil, and they are stronger and more productive than spring-sown crops; it has long been known that spring-sown crops yield higher when sown in late autumn. However, no one has tried winter sowing before, because it is difficult to do so: if sowing is too late, the soil freezes and is not easy to cultivate; if it is too early, the seeds will germinate in the soil and may die after a frost, because not all crops can overwinter anywhere.
    These contradictions caused Krylov a great deal of distress. "If sowing is done in severe cold," he thought, "then the seeds will not be frozen to death due to germination; moreover, in frozen soil, they will undergo complex physiological and biological changes similar to vernalization. Crops grown from such seeds will definitely be stronger, more robust, cold-resistant, and high-yielding than spring-sown crops. But the main difficulty is that frozen soil is as hard as stone, but can Soviet agriculture, which possesses a high level of technology, not overcome this obstacle? A machine must be manufactured that can cultivate frozen land..."
    Krylov's first bold experiment with winter sowing was only a small-scale trial sowing, using ordinary axes to dig furrows in the frozen soil.
    The inventor impatiently waited for the long winter to end, hoping to quickly confirm that his prediction was correct. How happy he was when the first sowing made his wish come true! Now large-scale winter sowing can be carried out. Of course, it is not possible to continue using axes; technology is needed, and special sowing machines need to be created. So design engineer Volf went to help him. Volf was also very interested in winter sowing.
    Extraordinary Sowing Machine
    The two inventors set about creating a winter sowing machine. They knew that it was impossible to cultivate, harrow, or weed the rock-hard frozen soil. All these pre-sowing tasks must be done in the autumn. In winter, it is only necessary to open furrows in the "stone-like" cultivated land. Ordinary sowing machine openers cannot do this. A new type of opener is needed. So the inventor invented a rotary cutter whose teeth could cut into frozen soil.
    The inventors used sowing machines with this type of opener to sow in frozen soil for four years. Last year, the inventor created a sowing machine equipped with a structurally updated opener. Based on the principle of cutting metal, he changed the cutter to a draw knife (a cutting tool, long and narrow, with rows of chisel-shaped teeth on it—editor). The teeth behind the draw knife are always slightly longer than the teeth in front. These teeth cut into the soil one by one, each cutting off a thin shaving.
    The new opener requires much less tractor pulling power than the first type, and it is simple in construction and light in weight. A snow-sweeping baffle is installed in front of the opener. The width of the furrow is eight to ten centimeters, and the depth can be varied depending on the crop. The seeds fall to the bottom of the furrow and are immediately covered with the soil and snow that have been cut off. The opener can be connected to ordinary sowing machines.
    Even with twenty to thirty centimeters of snow, this new type of sowing machine can still be used for sowing. If the snow is deeper, then a snowplow should be installed in front. When the tractor pulling the sowing machine finishes sowing one section and turns back to sow the adjacent section, the snowplow covers the sown fields like a blanket. The sowing machine is versatile and can be used for sowing grains, flax, and vegetables.
    Drought Resistance
　　Winter sowing is one of the best methods of drought resistance. Winter-sown plants emerge very quickly and evenly because they fully absorb the winter and spring moisture in the soil. Winter-sown seedlings quickly cover the land, preventing the soil from drying out and cracking quickly. The roots and stems of the crops develop and grow rapidly, and when the topsoil begins to dry out, the roots of the crops can already penetrate into the deeper soil layers that still retain moisture. This means that sowing in frozen soil can solve a major problem: regardless of whether the area is arid and regardless of rainfall, high and stable yields can be obtained.
    Conquering Weeds
    Winter sowing is also a good method of combating weeds.
    Winter-sown crops themselves can suppress weeds because they have the same developmental preparation as weeds, and their conditions are even better than weeds in early spring, because "weed seeds" are scattered in the compacted soil at different depths, so their germination period is longer; and because they do not belong to the same plant family, they do not germinate at the same time. Crops are different. Their seeds belong to the same family and are sown at a certain depth in furrows close to the topsoil, so they emerge evenly and quickly cover the entire field. Weeds that emerge after this are shaded by the seedlings and cannot grow well.
    Prospects
    Spring is a busy farming season, and plowing and sowing must be done at this time. Since the advent of winter sowing, the sowing time can be greatly extended, not just the short few days in spring, but from November to March of the following year, so various agricultural machinery and manpower can be fully utilized. This is a fundamental reform in agriculture!
    In addition, if sowing is done in spring, many precious warm and humid days will be wasted. Although the snow has melted and the soil has warmed up, the ground is still wet and cannot be mechanically cultivated. However, seeds that overwinter in the soil have already taken advantage of this "moment worth a thousand gold," germinating and emerging. Therefore, winter-sown crops mature much earlier than general spring-sown crops. This means that the boundaries of crop cultivation areas can be expanded and pushed to the far north.
    Seeds collected from winter-sown crops have a new and excellent characteristic: using them for spring sowing can also result in much earlier maturity than ordinary spring-sown crops, and can increase yields by 20%-30%.
    Winter sowing also plays a significant role in protecting crops from pests and diseases. This is due to the earlier development of seeds, which decouples the occurrence of pests and diseases from the crop growth stage. For example, when weevils appear, winter-sown beets are no longer tender seedlings suitable for the insect's taste, but have already become coarse. When flax and mustard are harvested, their pests—flea beetles—only appear then. Due to winter sowing, smut cannot approach grains, and carrot flies cannot approach carrots. Winter sowing almost completely avoids pest and disease infestation.
    Winter sowing has been tested not only in experimental fields but also in fields. Experiments have shown that various crops greatly increase production after winter sowing. "Moscow" spring wheat yields sixteen point seven seven quintals more per hectare when winter-sown compared to spring-sown; "Kamalichskaya" oat mixed seed yields seventeen point five quintals more per hectare; "Kabita" peas yield fifteen quintals more per hectare; and winter-sown "Nanteskaya" carrots yield as much as two hundred and seventy-six point seven quintals more per hectare. This is just the beginning.
    If you walk to the winter sowing experimental site of the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy in early July, you will see spring wheat just heading and flowering, but the winter wheat next to it is almost mature. Although it is only early July, winter-sown oats with heavy ears have grown like a green wall, but spring-sown oats stand next to it like its younger brother. Spring-sown flax is just opening light blue flowers, and winter-sown flax next to it is drooping with mature ears.
    Because of winter sowing, crops mature at different times, so harvesting must be done at different times. This means that winter sowing not only eases the tension during sowing but also eases the tension during harvesting. In this way, the seasonality of agricultural operations is eliminated. Future agricultural operations will be like factory operations, which can be carried out all year round.

    The picture shows the winter sowing machine with a new type of opener structure—a draw knife. The pressure on the draw knife is transmitted by a spring. Lengthening or loosening the spring can change the size of the pressure. The depth of the furrow is controlled by a special limiter.
    The picture shows a comparison of the growth of spring-sown and winter-sown wheat. In early July, at the winter sowing experimental station of the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, wheat sown from November to March is nearly mature, while wheat sown in May is just heading and flowering.

　　冬季播种
    苏联　阿·斯密尔尼亚坚娜
    两位苏联发明家打破了几千年的农业传统，创造了冬季播种的新方法，并制成了冬季播种机。这是农业上一项大胆的技术革新。
    冬季播种具有如下的优越性：①这是最好的抗旱方法之一，在冻土播种，不管雨量多少，都能获得丰收；②这是和杂草斗争的好方法；③播种时间可以由原来的几天延长到几个月，因而能充分利用各种农业机械和人力；④冬播作物要比一般春播作物成熟早得多；⑤冬播作物由于种籽发育较早，使病虫害的发生和作物生长阶段脱节，因而几乎完全避免了病虫害的侵袭。
    这种播种方法，经过试验，到处都获得巨大成果，各种冬播农作物都大大增产，产量高至50％至一倍。
    12月里，苏联的国土上早就到处都是一片冰雪，田野上难得看到人，一切耕作活动都已停止，农闲季节已经到来。可是，在莫斯科近郊的一个国营农场上，却有一台拖拉机，拖着播种机在慢慢地移动着。随着拖拉机向前移动，白雪皑皑的田野上出现一行行整齐的黑色的犁沟……如果你向在场的工作人员打听这究竟是怎么回事，他会微笑地告诉你说：“冬季播种！”
    冬季播种是农业上的一项大胆的技术革新，这是由苏联农业科学副博士谢尔盖·华西里耶维奇·克雷洛夫和设计工程师尼古拉·马努洛维奇·沃尔夫创议的。
    这两位革新家在冻土上试行播种已经有五年了。一开始，他们的试验田设在季米里亚捷夫农学院附属的蔬菜实验站里，在苏联著名科学家苏联科学院名誉院士维达利·伊万诺维奇·爱戴尔斯坦领导下进行工作。现在，冬季播种已经在莫斯科附近的高尔基第二农场和分布在苏联不同气候地区的一些农场里拥有大面积的试验田。
    这种不平常的播种方法，到处都获得惊人的成果：播种在冻土里的种籽，发芽整齐、稠密，作物成熟期比一般早三、四个星期，产量高50％至一倍。
    这不但是一种不平凡的播种方法，也是一种崭新的耕作方法。把种籽播种在冻土里，难道不怕把它们断送了吗？这样做是不是违反自然规律呢？不，作物的远祖——野生植物——的种子整冬都是留在土里的。人类把种籽从田里拿下来，放到谷仓里，正是违反了自然规律。大家一定见过这样的现象：春天一到，在土里顺利越过冬天的野草就往往先声夺人，压倒了羞怯怯的春播作物的幼芽。这是有原因的：野草种籽一冬都在作发育准备，它是经受了种种恶劣的自然条件，从坚苦环境中锻炼出来的，因而更加坚强、茁壮。
    秋播作物也须要在土里过冬，它们比春播作物健壮、高产，这是大家都知道的；春播作物在晚秋播种产量高也是老早就为人所熟知的。可是以前冬季播种就没有人试过，因为这样做有困难：播种晚了，土壤冻了，不容易耕作；早了也不行，种子在土壤里会发芽，往后一经霜冻就可能死亡，因为不是所有的农作物在任何地方都能越冬。
    这些矛盾使克雷洛夫大伤脑筋。“如果在严寒时候播种的话”，他思考着，“那时种籽就不会因发芽而遭冻毙；而且，在冻土里，它们将发生类似春化的复杂生理生物变化。从这样的种籽长出来的作物，一定会比春播作物更加坚强、茁壮、耐寒、高产。但主要的困难是冻土坚硬如石，可是具有高度技术水平的苏联农业难道就不能克服这个障碍吗？必须制造一种能够在冰冻的土地上耕作的机器……”
    克雷洛夫所进行冬季播种的第一次大胆的试验，只是小面积的试种，用普通的斧头在冻土里开掘犁沟。
    这位发明家急不可耐地等待漫长的冬季结束，希望快些证实他的预想是正确的。当第一次播种使他的愿望成为现实的时候，他是多么高兴啊！现在已经可以进行大面积冬播。当然，仍用斧头是不行的，还需要技术，需要创造特种播种机。于是设计工程师沃尔夫就去帮助他了，沃尔夫对于冬季播种也是很感兴趣的。
    不平凡的播种机
    这两位发明家着手创造冬季播种机。他们知道在坚硬如石的冻土上进行耕、耙、耘地是不可能的。所有这些播种前的工作必须从秋天做起，到了冬天只须在“石头似的”耕地上开出一条条的犁沟。普通播种机的开沟器不能够做到这一点。须要有新式的开沟器。于是这位发明家就发明了一种旋转削刀，它的刀齿能够切入冻土。
    发明家用带有这种开沟器的播种机在冻土上播种了四年。去年，这位发明家又创造了一种装有结构更新的开沟器的播种机。他根据切削金属的原理，把削刀改为拉刀（一种切削工具，长条形，上面有成排的凿子形的刀齿——编者）。拉刀的后面一个刀齿总是比前面一个刀齿稍长，这种刀齿一个个地切入土中，每个刀齿各削下一片不太厚的刨片。
    新式的开沟器需要的拖拉机曳引力比头一种小的多，而且构造简单，重量很轻。开沟器前面装有扫雪用的挡板。犁沟的宽度为八—十厘米，可深可浅，看什么作物而定。种子落在犁沟的底部，随即被切削下来的泥土和雪复盖。开沟器可以连在普通的播种机上。
    甚至雪深二十—三十厘米，用这种新式播种机仍可以播种。如果雪还要深，那么就应该在前面装置可以铲雪的铲土机。当拖带着播种机的拖拉机在一个地段播种完毕转回去播种邻近地段的时候，铲土机使雪像毯子一样复盖在播过种的田地上。播种机是万能式的，播种能进行谷物、亚麻和蔬菜的播种。
    抗旱
　　冬季播种是最好的抗旱方法之一。冬播植物出土的萌芽发育非常快速、整齐，因为土壤里的冬春水分都被它们充分吸收了。冬季播种的禾苗迅速遮盖着土地，使土地不致很快晒干、开裂。作物的根系和茎快速发育成长，当表土开始晒干的时候，作物的根已经能够钻到还保持有水份的深层土壤里去了。这就意味着，在冻土里播种可以解决一个重大的问题：不管地区是否干旱，不管降雨量多少，都可以获得高额而稳定的丰收。
    征服杂草
    冬季播种也是和杂草斗争的好方法。
    冬播作物本身就能压制杂草，因为它们在发育准备上和杂草是相同的，而且在早春它们的条件比杂草还要好些，因为“野草种籽”是散落在紧密的土壤里的，深浅不同，因此它们的发芽期间要长些；而且由于它们不是属于同一植物科系，因此不是同时发芽。作物就不同，它的种子属于同一科系，而且是播种在一定深度而又接近表土的犁沟里，因此出芽整齐，很快复盖了整片田野。在这以后出土的杂草已经被禾苗遮住，不能很好成长了。
    展望
    春天是农忙季节，耕耘土地、播种都要在这时进行，自从出现了冬季播种以后，播种时间可以大大延长，不是春天短短的几天，而是从11月到来年3月，所以各种农业机械和人力都能充分利用，这是农业上的根本改革！
    此外，如果在春天播种，就会有许多宝贵的温暖湿润的日子白白地浪费。因为雪虽然已经溶化了，土壤也变暖了，可是地还潮湿，不能进行机械耕作。然而，在土里过冬的种子却已经利用了这“一刻千金”的时机，发芽出土。因此冬播作物要比一般春播作物成熟早得多。这就意味着，作物的耕种区域的界限可以扩大，可以推向遥远的北方。
    从冬播作物收集来的种籽具有一个新的优良性质：用它们进行春播，也能比普通春播作物早熟得多，而且能增产20％—30％。
    在保护作物避免病虫害方面，冬季播种也起了显著的作用。这是由于种籽发育较早。使病虫害的发生和作物生长阶段脱节。例如当象鼻虫出现的时候，冬播甜菜已经不是合乎虫的口味的嫩苗，而是已经变得粗糙不堪了。亚麻和芥菜收成的时候，它们的害虫——跳?才出现。由于冬季播种黑穗病不能接近谷物，胡萝卜蝇子也无法接近胡萝卜。冬播几乎完全避免了病虫害的侵袭。
    冬季播种不但在试验田里试验过，也在田野里试验过。实验证明，各种不同农作物冬播后都大大增产。“莫斯科”种春小麦，冬播比春播每公顷增产十六点七七公担；“卡马立奇斯卡雅”燕麦混合种每公顷增产十七点五公担；“卡必大”豌豆每公顷增产十五公担；而冬播“南特斯卡雅”胡萝卜每公顷竟增产达二百七十六点七公担之多，这还仅仅是开始呢。
    如果在7月初走到季米里亚捷夫农学院的冬播试验站地段，你会看到春小麦刚刚抽穗开花，可是在旁边的冬播小麦已经将近成熟了。虽然只是7月初，带着沉甸甸的大穗子的冬播燕麦已经长得像一堵绿色的围墙，可是春播燕麦却好像它的弟弟一样站在旁边。春播亚麻刚开着浅蓝色的花，旁边的冬播亚麻却低垂着成熟的穗。
    由于冬季播种，庄稼在不同时期成熟，因此须要在不同时期进行收割。这就意味着冬季播种不但缓和了播种时的紧张状态，而且也缓和了收获时的紧张状态。这样一来，就消除了农业作业的季节性。将来的农业作业就像工厂作业一样，一年四季都可以进行。
