Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　Yan Jiujun, a carpenter at the farm tool factory of the Zhaoshui People's Commune in Quanzhou County, Guangxi, has created a "combined lifting, transporting, and unloading machine" made of wood. This machine can lift large stones or mud buckets weighing over 1000 jin from depths of one to four zhang, place them on a load-bearing cart, slide them away quickly and automatically, and then automatically dump them when they reach the end of the wooden track. The entire machine requires only four to eight people to operate, and it can lift, transport, and unload 120,000 jin of earth and stone in ten hours, increasing work efficiency sixteen times compared to manual handling, transportation, and unloading.

　　This combined machine is divided into eleven parts: a lifting tripod, winch, lifting rope, lifting hoist pulley, eagle claw hook, transport trolley, operating rope, load-bearing cart, wooden track, wooden track opening and closing joint, and movable switch. It is made entirely of wood, with a simple structure, and any general carpenter can manufacture it according to the drawings. Currently, it has been promoted and used at the Guanjiang water conservancy construction site, with very good results.

　　In supporting the county-run Guanjiang water conservancy project, the Zhaoshui Commune is responsible for excavating a twelve-li long canal, which includes digging through two rocky mountain ridges, making the project very arduous. In order to accelerate the progress of the project, the commune's Party committee actively led the masses to carry out technological innovations to improve work efficiency. Yan Jiujun, a carpenter working at the water conservancy construction site, under the leadership of the commune's Party committee and with the active support of the masses, demonstrated the communist spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. After seven days of labor, he first created a wooden crane. Operated by four people, it could lift large stones weighing 800 to 1600 jin from the bottom of ditches one to four zhang deep. Later, inspired by responsible cadres of the commune's Party committee, Yan Jiujun assembled this machine with a wooden rail car, and thus the "combined lifting, transporting, and unloading machine" was created.

　　阎九均创制起、运、卸联合机
    能从四丈深低处起卸千斤重物　比人工操作效率提高十六倍
    据新华社讯　广西全州县沼水人民公社农具厂木工阎九均用木料制成“起、运、卸联合机”。这种机器能从一丈至四丈深的低处，将一千斤以上的大石头或大泥桶吊上来，放在承重车上，自动快速滑走，滑到木轨的盘头，又自动倒卸。全部机械只需四人到八人操纵，十小时能起、运、卸十二万斤土石，比人工搬、运、卸提高工效十六倍。
    这种联合机分为起重三角架、绞关、起重绳、起重上吊滑车、鹰爪钩、运输滑车、运转绳、承重车、木轨、木轨启闭接头、活动开关等十一个部分，全用木材制成，构造简单，一般木工就能按照图样制造。目前，已在灌江水利工地推广使用，效果很好。
    沼水公社在支援县办的灌江水利工程中，负责开挖一条十二里长的渠道，其中要开凿两个石山岭，工程十分艰巨。公社党委为了加速工程进度，积极领导群众开展技术革新，提高工效，在水利工地上工作的木工阎九均，在公社党委领导和群众的积极支持下，发挥敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，经过七天的劳动，首先制成一架木制起重机。它由四人操作，能将八百至一千六百斤的大石头从一丈至四丈深的沟底吊上来。后来经过公社党委负责干部的启发，阎九均又把这架机械与木轨车装配在一起，就制成了“起、运、卸联合机”。
