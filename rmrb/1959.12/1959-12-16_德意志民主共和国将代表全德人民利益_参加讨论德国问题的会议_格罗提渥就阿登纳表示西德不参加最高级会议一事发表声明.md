Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 14th: According to the German News Agency today, the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, issued a statement regarding the West German Federal Chancellor Adenauer's declaration that West Germany will not participate in the East-West summit conference.

In his statement, Grotewohl first pointed out that participation in all discussions concerning the interests of the German nation is an inalienable right of the German nation. No one, not even Mr. Adenauer, can waive this right on behalf of Germany.

The statement said that only the representatives of the two German governments participating in all solutions regarding the German question can express the legitimate interests of the German people.

The statement said that if Adenauer wants to give up attending the summit conference (although the conference discusses the German question), then the government of the German Democratic Republic will speak on behalf of the citizens of the German Democratic Republic and the whole of Germany, and will solely represent the national interests of the German people. The German Democratic Republic insists on being able to participate in discussions concerning the German Democratic Republic and the German people.

The statement concluded by pointing out that in order to ease the international situation, to sign a peace treaty with the two Germanies and to eliminate the abnormal situation in West Berlin, the government of the German Democratic Republic will safeguard the national interests of the German people and is prepared to participate in the summit conference.

    新华社柏林14日电　据德意志通讯社今天报道：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥就西德联邦总理阿登纳表示西德不参加东西方最高级会议一事发表了声明。
    格罗提渥在声明中首先指出，参加所有有关德国民族利益的问题的讨论，是德国民族不可被剥夺的权利。任何人，甚至阿登纳先生，也不能代表德国放弃这一权利。
    声明说，只有两个德国政府的代表参加所有有关德国问题的解决，德国人民的合法利益才能表达出来。
    声明说，如果阿登纳要放弃参加最高级会议（虽然这个会议讨论德国问题），那么，德意志民主共和国政府就将代表德意志民主共和国公民和整个德国发言，并且将单独代表德国人民的民族利益。德意志民主共和国坚持要求能够参加有关德意志民主共和国和德国人民问题的讨论。
    声明最后指出，为了缓和国际局势、同两个德国签订和约和消除西柏林不正常状态，德意志民主共和国政府将维护德国人民的民族利益，准备参加最高级会议。
