How to Build Pig Farms in the Fields
Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry

    Since the Hongsheng Production Team of Herong People's Commune in Dangyang County, Hubei Province, popularized the experience of building pig farms in the fields, a high tide of building pig farms in the fields is forming in various parts of Hubei Province.

    Four Major Benefits

    A pig farm in the field means building the pig farm in the field. This can give full play to the role of pig raising in accumulating fertilizer and save a lot of labor for accumulating and transporting fertilizer. Since the Hongsheng Production Team generally built pig farms in the fields, the amount of fertilizer transported by each person per day increased to more than 80 loads. The team saved more than 20,000 labor days in fertilizer transportation this year compared to previous years. The commune members summarized that pig farms in the fields have four major benefits: First, it saves labor for accumulating and transporting fertilizer; Second, it improves the soil and eliminates the white water paddies that are not fertilized and the dead corner fields that are short of fertilizer all year round; Third, it can apply fertilizer in a timely manner to meet the needs of crop growth and development; Fourth, it creates good conditions for human and animal hygiene and village environmental sanitation. This team, due to the construction of pig farms in the fields this year, has more fertilizer and timely fertilization. The average yield of early rice increased by 34.6% compared to last year. Although late rice suffered from a severe drought, the average yield also increased by 18.4% compared to last year. Pig farms in the fields also create favorable conditions for supplying feed, establishing feed bases, and using agricultural by-products as feed.

    The farm construction plan should be linked with the planning of large-scale garden-style farmland, water and soil management, and mountain management, and arranged in a unified manner.

    Site Selection

    The location of the pig farm in the field should be selected near the cultivated area or in the center of the cultivated area, so that it is convenient for transporting and applying fertilizer; farms should also be built in places far from residential areas, with poor soil quality, and chronically short of fertilizer. Several larger pig farms in the fields of the Hongsheng Production Team (as shown in Figure 1) are distributed in four cultivated fields, and pig farms are also reasonably built near the fields on the hills and the fields far from the village. The terrain of the site should be selected on a relatively flat, dry, well-drained slope with a low water table, facing south or southeast. Water source is also an important condition for site selection, because a large amount of water is needed for preparing feed, drinking water, flushing pig houses, and washing breeding tools. It is best to choose a site next to a spring, stream, or large pond that does not dry up all year round. Digging wells to use groundwater is also a way. The site should make full use of wasteland as much as possible to avoid occupying cultivated land. The size of the site depends on the number of pigs raised and the possible conditions for development. Generally, a small farm with more than 100 and less than 500 pigs is appropriate.

    Layout of the Pig Farm

    The layout of the pig farm should be compact and meet the requirements of epidemic prevention and hygiene, and should have a certain area of ​​exercise ground. There should be a certain distance between pig houses. There should be passages inside and outside the farm. Pig houses, feed processing rooms, feed storage rooms, breeders' dormitories, veterinary rooms, haystacks, silage cellars, playgrounds, manure storage pools, water sources, water storage disinfection places, sick pig isolation houses, green areas, etc. should be unified and rationally arranged. Here is an illustration of the layout plan of the pig raising center in the fields of the Hongsheng Production Team (Figure 2) for reference.

    Pig House Design

    The style of pig houses should be determined according to the classification, use, and regional conditions of the pig herd, and should not be the same. The "universal pig house" with double slopes and double rows can be used in the pig farm in the fields to raise more pigs, and the utilization rate of the pig house is higher. Boars, sows, growing pigs, and fattening pigs can all be raised. As shown in Figures (3) (4) (5) for illustration. The roofing material of the pig house can be adapted to local conditions. In mountainous areas with abundant wood, bark can be used. In rice and wheat producing areas, rice straw and wheat straw can be used. In areas with more reeds and reeds on the grassland and lake shore, reeds, reeds, and reed mats can be used. If conditions permit, using tile roofs is more durable. The walls of the pig house should be based on insulation and resistance to damage. Of course, it is good to build walls with bricks and stones, but it is also good to use adobe and filled earth walls plus fences. Or use bricks and stones to build a wall foundation of 0.8 meters to 1 meter high, and then build a mud wall on top. The ground of the pig house should be more than 20 centimeters higher than the ground outside the house. It should be easy to keep dry, flat, and firm, and easy to clean and disinfect. In places with stones, stone blocks can be used to pave the ground, and gray sand can be used to join the seams. In winter, more grass can be added to keep warm. In areas where wood is produced, using wooden boards as flooring is the most ideal. Cement can also be used, and more grass should be added in winter. Laying the ground with clay is soft, warm, and economical, but it is easy to develop depressions and difficult to keep dry, so it must be repaired and filled frequently. The window area of ​​the pig house should be in a ratio of 1:12 to 1:15 to the pig house floor. The windows should be 1.1 to 1.2 meters above the ground. Two small doors should be opened in the pig pen to facilitate the breeder to clean and the pigs to enter and exit. Each pig house should have no less than two large doors. The doors should open outwards, and the door frame should be rounded to prevent pigs from crowding and damaging when entering and exiting. The pig bed floor should be slightly inclined to facilitate flushing of feces and urine. The manure ditch can be made of brick, stone or cement. The manure storage pool should be watertight in principle, and the size should be able to store pig manure for more than one month. In order to prevent fertilizer loss, it should be covered or shed.

　　怎样修建田头养猪场
　　湖北省农业厅畜牧处
    湖北当阳县河溶人民公社红胜生产队大办田头养猪场经验推广以后，湖北省各地兴建田头养猪场正在形成一个高潮。
    四大好处
    田头养猪场，就是把养猪场建在田头上。这样可以充分发挥养猪积肥的作用，节省大量积肥、运肥的劳动力。红胜生产队由于普遍建了田头养猪场，每天每人运肥提高到八十担以上，全队今年运肥劳动力比往年节省两万多个。社员们总结田头养猪场有四大好处：第一、节省了积肥、送肥劳动力；第二、改良了土壤，消灭了不施肥的白水田和常年缺肥的死角田；第三、能及时施肥，满足禾苗生长发育的需要；第四、为人畜卫生和村庄的环境卫生创造了良好的条件。这个队由于今年建了田头养猪场，施肥多，施肥及时，早稻平均单产比去年提高34.6％；晚稻虽然遭受了严重的旱灾，平均单产也比去年提高18.4％。田头养猪还为供应饲料，建立饲料基地，利用农作物副产品作饲料，创造了有利条件。
    建场计划要和大地园田化规划、治水治土治山规划联系起来，统一安排。
    场址的选择
    田头养猪场的位置，应选在靠近耕作区或设在耕作区的中央，这样就便于送肥、施肥；离居住点远、土质差、常年缺肥的地方也要建场。红胜生产队几个较大的田头养猪场（如图一）分布在四个耕作畈中，岗地上的田及离村庄远的田附近也比较合理的建了养猪场。场址的地势应选择比较平坦、高燥、排水条件良好、地下水位较低、面朝南或东南的斜坡上。水源也是选择场址的一个重要条件，因为调制饲料、饮水、猪舍冲洗、饲养工具的洗刷等需要大量的水。最好选有泉水、溪水或终年不干的大池塘旁边。打井利用地下水，也是一个办法。场址应尽量利用荒地，以免占用耕地。场址面积大小，决定于养猪头数和发展的可能条件。一般以养一百头以上五百头以下小型场为宜。
    猪场的布置
    猪场布置既要紧凑，又要符合防疫卫生的要求，要有一定面积的运动场地。猪舍之间要有一定的间隔距离。场内场外有通道。场内猪舍、饲料加工房、饲料贮藏室、饲养员宿舍、兽医室、堆草场、青贮窖缸场、运动场、贮屎尿池、水源、贮水消毒处、病猪隔离舍、绿化地区等都要统一、合理安排。这里介绍红胜生产队田头养猪中心场布置规划示意图（图二）以供参考。
    猪舍设计
    猪舍式样应根据猪群分类、用途、地区情况而定，不能千篇一律。田头养猪场采用双坡式、双列式“万能猪舍”可多养猪，猪舍利用率较高。公猪、母猪、架子猪、肥猪等都可喂养。如图（三）（四）（五）说明。猪舍屋顶材料可因地制宜。山区木材多，可用树皮。稻麦产区可用稻草、麦秸。草滩、湖滨茅草多的地方可用茅草、芦柴和芦席。有条件的用瓦屋顶，比较经久耐用。猪舍墙壁以保温和不易损毁为原则。用砖、石砌墙当然好，用土坯和灌土墙另加围栏也好。或者采用砖石砌建零点八米到一米高的墙基，上面筑土墙也可。猪舍地面应高出舍外地面二十分米以上，要易于保持干燥、平整、坚固，便于打扫和消毒。有石头的地方可用石块铺地，灰沙合缝，冬天冷了可多垫草保暖。出产木材地区采用木板作地板最为理想。用水泥也可，冬天也要多垫草。用粘土铺地面，柔软、保暖、经济，但易发生凹洼，不易保持干燥，必须经常修填。猪舍窗户面积要与猪舍地面成一比十二到一比十五的比例。窗户应距地面一点一到一点二米为宜。猪栏要开两个小门，以便于饲养员打扫和猪的出入。每幢猪舍要不少于两个大门，门向外开，门框应该做成圆角，以防猪出入拥挤损伤。猪床地面应略带倾斜，便于冲洗屎尿。排粪便沟可用砖石或水泥砌成。贮屎尿池以不漏水为原则，大小应能贮存一个月以上的猪屎尿为好。为了防止肥效损失，上面应加盖或搭棚。　（摘自湖北日报）（附图片）
