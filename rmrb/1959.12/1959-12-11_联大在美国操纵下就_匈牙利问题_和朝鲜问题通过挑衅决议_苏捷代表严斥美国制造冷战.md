Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion of the so-called "Hungarian Question" and the Korean Question on the 9th.

The United States, utilizing its voting machine, passed the US proposal interfering in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Hungary with a majority vote. Delegations from socialist countries and Yugoslavia voted against it. Delegations from seventeen countries abstained from voting: Afghanistan, Ceylon, Ethiopia, Finland, Ghana, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Republic, and Yemen.

Czechoslovakian representative Nosek said in a speech after the vote that everyone knows that the so-called "Hungarian question" is a link in the chain of provocations taken by "Cold War" forces, and the purpose of raising this question is to poison the atmosphere of this session of the United Nations General Assembly, thereby deteriorating the international situation.

Nosek emphasized that the resolution imposed on the United Nations is a gross violation of the United Nations Charter.

Subsequently, the United Nations General Assembly discussed the report submitted by the Political Committee on the Korean question and the American proposal adopted by the committee.

Soviet representative Sobolev said in his speech at the meeting that the discussion at the meeting has clearly shown that the method of resolving the Korean question mentioned in this proposal has nothing in common with the spirit of cooperation talked about a lot at this meeting, or the idea that all international disputes should be resolved peacefully through negotiation. This proposal uses the language of coercion and the "Cold War," and it requires the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to unconditionally agree to the conditions of the countries that participated in the war of aggression against Korea. The purpose pursued by the drafters of the proposal is to permanently maintain the division of Korea and to continue to station their troops on Korean territory. The United Nations General Assembly passed the American proposal with a majority vote. Nine delegations from socialist countries voted against it. Seventeen delegations abstained from voting.

    联大在美国操纵下就“匈牙利问题”和朝鲜问题通过挑衅决议
    苏捷代表严斥美国制造冷战
    新华社10日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会9日结束了所谓“匈牙利问题”和朝鲜问题的讨论。
    美国利用表决机器，以多数票通过了干涉匈牙利人民共和国内政的美国提案。社会主义国家和南斯拉夫的代表团投了反对票。十七个国家的代表团在投票时弃权，它们是阿富汗、锡兰、埃塞俄比亚、芬兰、加纳、几内亚、印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、以色列、约旦、黎巴嫩、利比亚、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、阿拉伯联合共和国和也门。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表诺塞克在表决之后发言说，每个人都知道，所谓“匈牙利问题”是“冷战”势力所采取的挑衅的链条中的一环，提出这个问题的目的在于毒化联合国大会这次会议的气氛，从而使国际局势恶化。
    诺塞克着重指出，强加于联合国的这个决议是粗暴地破坏联合国宪章。
    随后联合国大会讨论了政治委员会就朝鲜问题提出的报告和委员会通过的美国提案。
    苏联代表索波列夫在会议上发言时说，会议上的讨论已经明显地说明，这个提案所说的解决朝鲜问题的方法同这次会议上谈论很多的合作精神，或一切国际争端应该用谈判的方法和平解决的思想毫无共同之点。这个提案使用的是强制和“冷战”语言，它要求朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府无条件地同意参加侵朝战争的国家的条件。提案起草人所要追求的目的在于，永久保持朝鲜的分裂和使自己的军队继续驻扎在朝鲜领土上。联合国大会以多数票通过了美国提案。社会主义国家的九个代表团投了反对票。十七个代表团在表决时弃权。
