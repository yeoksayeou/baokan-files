    On the Xiangjiang Embankment
    Gao Gejin
    Suddenly, a strong wind sprang up in the morning, mixed with violent raindrops, hitting people head-on. The temperature plummeted from about ten degrees Celsius to around zero degrees. However, along the boundless Xiangjiang River, it was a scene of bustling activity, with thousands of people fiercely engaged in the vast water conservancy construction site. Some were raising and reinforcing the Xiangjiang levee, while others were digging canals and ponds to facilitate drainage or water storage in the future.
    Why is it that the scale, momentum, and enthusiasm of the peasants in building water conservancy projects are greater this year than in any previous year? I found a very satisfactory answer in Jinggang Commune along the Xiangjiang River. Before communization, they had only thirty-seven water pumps. This year, they used the commune's industrial income to buy more than thirty water pumps and more than a dozen tractors, which is more than the total number purchased by the cooperatives in several years. This summer and autumn, the entire commune suffered a continuous hundred-day drought, but thanks to the full use of machinery for continuous day and night irrigation, more than 14,500 laborers were saved, enabling the entire commune's 79,205 mu of double-season late rice to achieve a particularly bumper harvest, with an average yield of 531 jin per mu, an increase of 63% compared to the per mu yield of double-season late rice in the Great Leap Forward year of last year. If it weren't for the superiority of the commune, which enabled the commune to purchase so many machines, it is estimated that 30,000 mu of the fields with the most difficult water sources would have dried up, resulting in a loss of more than 15 million jin of rice. Now, the Party is leading the people to start water conservancy projects early. In case the Xiangjiang River floods next year, the raised and reinforced levee will prevent breaches and disasters; if there is a severe drought? We won't just rely on manual water wheels and mechanical irrigation, which would cause excessive labor strain, but will have many large ponds and canals working together for self-flowing irrigation. The peasants see the benefits of the people's commune and large-scale water conservancy very clearly, so how can they not seize every minute and second, "grabbing sunny days, seizing cloudy days, and treating windy and rainy days as good days" to work hard, practically, and cleverly?!
    Braving the wind and rain, I walked on the construction site where the Xiangjiang levee was being raised and reinforced. I saw thousands of workers under the levee wearing straw raincoats and barefoot, carrying soil in a race against each other. In a thatched shed, carpenters were rushing to repair old wheelbarrows, repairing a batch and quickly transporting them to the construction site. One slope was particularly high and steep, so several young men installed triangular tree forks on the slope, preparing to tie two large iron wires on them to hoist carts and transport soil, improving work efficiency. Because the water conservancy project had only just begun, there were still many young men and women carrying soil. People were like a torrent on the Xiangjiang River, with the waves of the future pushing the waves of the present. A young man wearing a bamboo hat and with his trouser legs rolled up to his thighs rushed forward with two baskets of soil. A young woman in a large red floral cotton-padded jacket, carrying two overflowing loads of soil on her shoulders, overtook the young man in one stride and rushed ahead. A young man immediately started playing a quick-beat and singing, "The newlyweds are competing as heroes, striving for a good start, everyone follows and leaps forward, water conservancy leads the way to ensure a bumper harvest." It turned out that the young couple were competing!

    湘江堤上
    高歌今
    早晨突然刮起了大风，夹着狂暴的雨点，劈头盖脸地向人打来。气温已从摄氏十来度骤降到零度左右。可是，在一望无边的湘江沿岸，这时却是热气腾腾，千军万马正激战在辽阔的水利建设工地上。有的在加高加固湘江大堤，有的在开渠挖塘，往后好排水或蓄水。
    眼下农民修水利的声势规模和干劲为什么比过去哪一年都大呢？我从湘江沿岸的靖港公社找到了非常满意的答案。他们公社化前才三十七台抽水机，今年拿公社的工业收入就买了三十多台抽水机和十几台拖拉机，比过去合作社几年买的总数还多。今年夏秋全社连续遭到百日无雨的大旱，可是由于充分利用机械日夜不停地排灌，节省了一万四千五百多个劳力，使全社七万九千二百零五亩双季晚稻普遍获得特大丰收，平均亩产五百三十一斤，比大跃进的去年的双季晚稻亩产还增长63％。要不是公社的优越性使社里增购了那么多机器，估计水源最困难的三万亩田将被干死，要损失稻谷一千五百多万斤。现在，党领导着人们及早动手大兴水利。万一明年遇到湘江发大水，大堤加高加固了就不致溃堤成灾；要是碰到大旱呢？也不会光靠人工车水和机械排灌，造成劳力的过分紧张，而有很多大塘水渠自流灌溉相配合。农民把人民公社和大兴水利的好处看得一清二楚，他们怎么会不“抢晴天，抓阴天，刮风下雨当好天”地争分夺秒，苦干、实干和巧干呢？！
    我迎着风雨走在加高加固湘江大堤的工地上。我看到堤下的千百个民工披着蓑衣，打着赤脚，正在你追我赶地运土。在一个茅草棚里，木匠们正在抢修破旧的手推车，修好一批，就赶紧运一批到工地上去。有一个坡又高又陡，几个小伙子就在坡上坡下安上三角形的树杈，准备在上面拴上两根大铁丝，好吊车运土，提高工效。因为水利工程刚开始不久，挑土的青年男女还不少。人们正像一股湘江上的激流似的，后浪推前浪。有个头戴斗笠，裤脚卷到大腿的小伙子挑了两筐土往前冲，跟在后面的一个穿着大红花棉袄的年轻女人，双肩挑了两担冒尖土，一飞步就赶过了那个小伙子，冲到前面去了。有个小青年马上“呱?”、“呱?”打着快板唱起来：“新婚夫妇比英雄，争取来个开门红，大伙跟上齐跃进，水利先行保丰收”。原来是小两口正在竞赛哩！
