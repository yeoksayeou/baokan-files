University Graduates from Three Different Eras
By Our Correspondent Zhou Jianying

    The Great Revolution in Education has been going on vigorously for over a year. Recently, this reporter interviewed three university graduates who studied civil engineering and construction during different periods. They all said in unison, based on their personal experiences: University graduates who have participated in productive labor are good!

    The Youth of a Female Technician
    "Some people" say that it is a "waste of youth" for university students to participate in labor.

    The situation of Song Wanru, a young female technician—the first group of university graduates after the education revolution last year—after starting work answers this question.

    Song Wanru was a student majoring in "Industrial and Civil Architecture" at Taiyuan Institute of Technology. During the Great Leap Forward and the education revolution, she and her classmates began to do things that previous graduates had not done, participating in productive labor. After returning to school, they did their graduation design "for real" with their classmates. In just a few months, they completed architectural designs for a cement plant, an exhibition hall, a barber shop, and a new type of butcher shop. Now these buildings have been completed and put into production or delivered for use.

    Practical training and education received from the working people during labor enabled these university students to understand how to rely on the Party and the masses to solve problems and gain higher independent working abilities. After graduation, Song Wanru was assigned to the Diaoyutai construction site, one of the capital's key construction projects, to be responsible for technical innovation. This task required both theoretical understanding and practical operation skills, as well as organizational and promotional work. Initially, she was a little timid. After "getting started," the real test came. In the work of tiling (white tiles on bathroom walls), the workers here could only lay one tile at a time, while other construction sites used a special wooden board to install the tiles first, allowing them to lay more than a dozen at a time. Song Wanru planned to promote this new method on her construction site. At first, some people were concerned that the new method would affect the quality. With the support of the Party organization, Song Wanru worked with the workers to conduct experiments and held comparison demonstrations of the new and old tiling methods on the construction site. Song Wanru personally worked with the workers in Fu Zuochen's group to lay the tiles using the new method. After careful inspection, the workers found that it was neat and firm, not only faster but also of better quality than the old method. This new method was quickly promoted. Song Wanru then worked with the workers to continue improving the tools, increasing the number of tiles that could be laid at one time to more than forty, and also tried using this method to lay the "facing bricks" on the exterior walls of buildings, which increased efficiency by more than ten times. Later, the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau held an on-site meeting at this construction site to promote the new tiling method, and Fu Zuochen's group was named an advanced collective in Beijing. At this construction site, relying on the masses and her own hands-on operation, Song Wanru promoted, identified, and improved more than twenty advanced experiences created by the workers. The workers felt that today's university students not only understand the principles in books but can also do things practically, so they all liked her very much.

    Soon, Song Wanru was transferred to be responsible for construction organization design work, which required familiarity with the workers' situation and construction procedures on the construction site, which was another step forward in the test for Song Wanru. But she knew how to rely on the masses, so she quickly became competent in this work. In order to enable the floor and roof of a 1,800-square-meter large canteen under construction to be built simultaneously, she also worked with the foreman to design a method using large trusses to accelerate the progress of the project.

    New Engineer Eager to Catch Up
    Cai Rongdu, a young engineer and member of the Communist Youth League, graduated from the Department of Architecture of Peking University in 1951. Although he also did a graduation design before graduation—an ingenious fan-shaped cinema—it could not be used for construction because all the construction conditions and building materials in the design were hypothetically based on his own subjective wishes.

    After starting work and arriving at the construction site, he found that his practical knowledge, and even some tools and equipment, the names learned in books did not match the real objects, and he needed to learn from scratch. He had no choice but to consult workers on the construction site every day, and make up for these important lessons one by one, before his work could move forward step by step.

    Seeing the superiority of the combination of theory and practice in the learning of university students who have interned and labored on construction sites in recent years, Cai Rongdu said: "Today's university students are much better than me." He told me that once on the construction site, some steel plates needed to be welded immediately, but the welder was not there, and he himself didn't know how to do it. Just when he was extremely anxious, a female student from Tianjin University who was interning jumped over and started working.

    This young engineer said: Our production objects are constantly changing, each project is different, and there must be new arrangements each time. The basis for this new arrangement is "practice." It is not only a great thing for university students to participate in productive labor in school, but also to continue to participate in productive labor after taking up work.

    The Heartfelt Words of an Old Engineer
    Huang Qiang, a white-haired old engineer from the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, couldn't help but recall his youth to the reporter as he watched the university graduates around him become more and more capable:

    Twenty-four years ago, Huang Qiang stepped into society with a diploma from the Department of Civil Engineering of Tsinghua University and later went to study in the United States. However, in the long fourteen years before liberation, the total area of ​​buildings he remembered designing was only five or six hundred square meters (equivalent to a small building).

    After liberation, he truly returned to the technical team. In the past ten years, he has been engaged in both design and research work. He began to go deep into reality and conducted a lot of research on the relationship between the characteristics of Chinese loess and gray soil and building foundations. He also learned a lot of advanced knowledge from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, and that's when his career began its youth.

    Today, Huang Qiang is already a member of the Chinese Communist Party, serving as the director of the "Foundation and Foundation Research Office" of the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. He is leading a group of young university graduates to do research work. Now, whenever he sees young people taking over special research projects less than half a year after leaving school; when he admires the towering buildings such as the Great Hall of the People and the Museum in the capital, and remembers that the wisdom and labor of newly graduated university students and even undergraduates are also condensed here, his heart is filled with envy and emotion. He said: The work achievements of the younger generation of university students far exceed those of their predecessors as soon as they start working, which eloquently demonstrates the brilliant victory of the Party's education policy.

    三个不同时期毕业的大学生
    本报记者　周建英
    教育大革命轰轰烈烈地进行了一年多，记者最近访问了三个不同时期学土木建筑工程的大学毕业生。他们以亲身的感受，异口同声地说：参加过劳动生产的大学毕业生就是好！
    女技术员的青春
    “某些人”说，大学生参加劳动是“浪费青春”。
    青年女技术员——去年教育革命后第一批从大学毕业的宋宛如，参加工作后的情形回答了这个问题。
    宋宛如是太原工学院“工业和民用建筑”专业的学生。大跃进和教育革命中，她和她的同学们开始做以前毕业生没有干过的事，参加生产劳动。回校后，又和同班的同学“真刀真枪”作毕业设计，在短短几个月中，完成了水泥厂、展览馆、理发室、新型肉铺等建筑设计。现在这些建筑已经建成投入生产或交付使用了。
    实际的锻练，在劳动中从劳动人民中受到的教育，使这些大学生懂得依靠党和群众解决问题，获得较高的独立工作能力。宋宛如毕业后被分配到首都重点建筑工程之一的钓鱼台工地，担任技术革新工作。这个任务，既需懂理论又要会实际操作，还得进行组织和宣传工作，最初她有点儿胆怯。“上马”以后，真正的考验来了。贴瓷砖（浴室墙上的白瓷砖）的工作，这里工人一次只能贴一块。而别的工地用一种特制木版先装好瓷砖，一次能贴十几块。宋宛如打算把这种新方法推广到自己的工地上来。开始时，有些人耽心新做法影响质量。宋宛如在党组织的支持下，和工人们一起作试验，在工地上举行新旧贴砖方法对比表演。宋宛如亲自和傅左臣小组的工人用新方法把砖贴上去，工人们仔细检查以后，发现又整齐又牢固，不仅速度快，而且质量也比老方法好，这种新办法很快推广。宋宛如接着又和工人们一起继续改进工具，提高到一次能贴四十几块，还和工人一起试用这个方法贴建筑物外墙的“面砖”，效率也提高了十多倍。后来北京市建筑工程局在这个工地召开了推广新法贴砖的现场会议，傅左臣小组被评为北京市先进集体。宋宛如在这个工地上依靠群众和自己亲手操作，推广、鉴定、改进了二十多项工人创造的先进经验。工人们觉得今天的大学生不光懂得书本上的道理，还能动手做，因此都很喜欢她。
    不久宋宛如又调去担任施工组织设计工作，这要求熟悉工地上工人情况和施工工序，对宋宛如的考验又进了一步。可是她懂得依靠群众，因此也很快地胜任了这项工作。为了使兴建中的一座一千八百平方米大食堂的地板和屋顶同时施工，她还协同工长设计用大桁架的办法，加速了工程的进度。
    新工程师赶忙补课
    年轻的工程师、共青团员蔡荣都，是1951年由北京大学建筑系毕业的。他在毕业前虽也作了毕业设计——一座别出心裁的扇形电影院，可是不能拿去施工，因为设计中所有的施工条件和建筑材料都是根据自己主观愿望假想出来的。
    参加工作后一到工地上，就发现实际知识以至有好些工具设备，书上学来的名称和实物都配不上来，需要从头学起。他只好天天到工地上请教工人，把这些重要的课目一节一节补起来，工作才一步一步往前走。
    蔡荣都看到这几年来工地实习和劳动的大学生学习中理论联系实际的优越性，他说：“现在的大学生可比我强多了。”他告诉我，有一次工地上，有些钢板需要立即焊接，当时电焊工不在，而他自己又不会，正急得要命时，天津大学来实习的一个女学生跳过来就干。
    这位年轻的工程师说：我们的生产对象经常变化，一个工程一个样，每次都要有新安排，这新安排的根据就是“实际”。大学生不仅在学校里参加劳动生产是件大大的好事，而且走上工作岗位后，还要不断地参加生产劳动。
    老工程师的肺腑之言
    建筑工程部建筑科学研究院一位双鬓斑白的老工程师黄强，眼看着自己周围的大学毕业生，一批比一批能干，禁不住对记者回忆起他的青年时代：
    二十四年前，黄强捧着清华大学土木工程系的毕业文凭跨进社会，后来，又到美国去留学。可是，在解放前漫长的十四年中，他记忆中所设计的建筑物面积的总和，不过五、六百平方米（相当一座小楼房）。
    解放后，他才真正归了技术队伍。这十年来，又搞设计，又搞研究工作。他开始深入实际，对中国黄土、灰土的特性同建筑基础的关系，作了不少研究，他还学了好些从苏联等兄弟国家来的有关先进学问，这才开始他事业的青春时代。
    今天，黄强已经是中国共产党党员，担任着建筑工程部建筑科学研究院
  “地基基础研究室”主任职务。正在领导着一群年轻大学毕业生做研究工作。现在每当他眼看着年轻人一出校门不到半年，就接手做专题研究；当他瞻仰首都人民大会堂、博物馆等一幢幢巍然矗立的大建筑物，想起这里面也凝结着新毕业的大学生甚至没有毕业的大学生的智慧和劳动时，内心里充满了羡慕、感慨。他说：青年一代大学生一出马的工作成绩就大大超过前人，雄辩地说明了党的教育方针的光辉胜利。（附图片）
