　　Soviet Advanced Pig Farmer Belova
    One Person Raises 1,500 Pigs in One Year
    Valentina Belova, an advanced pig farmer at the "Bolshevik" State Farm in the Kalinin Oblast of the Soviet Union, single-handedly raised 1,000 pigs in seven months during the spring and summer of this year. In July, she added 700 piglets. She pledged to raise 1,500 pigs single-handedly this year. Belova has already delivered 900 quintals of pork to the state and will deliver at least another 300 quintals before the end of the year, totaling 1,200 quintals (i.e., 120,000 kilograms). This figure is equivalent to seventeen years' worth of tasks and exceeds the entire state farm's annual plan by 100 quintals.
    This spring, as the call to march towards communism resounded across the Soviet land, Belova pondered day and night: how could she respond to the Party's call and elevate her state farm to an advanced level of production? Therefore, at the All-State Pig Farmers' Conference, she proposed a bold personal plan: to raise 1,000 pigs alone and complete ten years' quota in one year. Many people were skeptical of her plan. Some said that she might not even be able to manage 500, let alone 1,000. However, Belova's reply was, "I will definitely do it."
    Belova's plan received the active support of the director of her state farm. The director and agronomist helped her arrange how to rationally select the location of the pig farm and how to use some mechanized and automated tools to reduce labor.
    Soon, Belova's pig farm was set up. The pig farm was equipped with automatic feeding and watering equipment, and next to the pig farm were large areas of alfalfa, corn, potatoes, and other feed production areas. Belova scientifically managed her time. She added feed and water on time. At noon, while the pigs were resting, she carefully observed all the pigs. Once she found any that were unhealthy, she immediately separated them from the herd and provided individual care. In this way, after a few months, although Belova raised 1,000 pigs, she still had spare time. So in July, she took on another 700 piglets to raise and made a promise: to raise 1,500 pigs this year. The pigs raised by Belova were not only numerous, but they also grew very quickly. For example, in July, the pigs she raised gained an average of nearly half a kilogram of meat per day.
    In addition to the conditions of communist labor enthusiasm and mechanized and automated equipment, one of the main reasons why Belova was able to raise so many pigs single-handedly was her adoption of a new method of categorized feeding. She divided the pig farm into several areas, with different types of pigs placed in each area. For example, one area was for sows used exclusively for breeding, another area was for sows used as meat pigs after one breeding cycle, and another area was for weaned piglets, and so on. In this way, it was very convenient to care for and feed the pigs according to the characteristics of each category.
    Due to the adoption of the categorized feeding method, Belova saved the state farm 130,000 rubles in the summer alone. The cost per kilogram of pork was reduced to less than five rubles, more than half of last year's cost.
    Belova is very passionate about her work, and she is wholeheartedly committed to contributing more to the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan. She is not satisfied with her achievements and has put forward an even more ambitious plan: to raise 2,800 pigs next year, and during the entire Seven-Year Plan, she plans to raise 10,000 pigs and deliver 7,500 quintals of meat to the state!

### 苏联先进养猪员别洛娃  一人一年喂大一千五百头猪

　　苏联先进养猪员别洛娃
    一人一年喂大一千五百头猪
    苏联加里宁州“布尔什维克”国营农场先进养猪员瓦莲吉娜·别洛娃，在今年一春一夏七个月内一人喂养大了一千头猪，7月份又增加了七百头仔猪。她保证今年一人要喂大一千五百头猪。别洛娃已经交给了国家九百公担猪肉，到年底以前至少还要交三百公担，共计要交一千二百公担（即十二万公斤）。这个数字相当于十七年的任务，比整个国营农场全年计划还要多一百公担。
    今年春天，当苏维埃大地上响遍了向共产主义进军的号角时，别洛娃日夜思考着一个问题：自己用什么来响应党的号召，怎样使自己的国营农场提高到先进的生产水平呢？于是她在全州养猪员大会上提出了一个大胆的个人计划：一个人喂养一千头猪、一年完成十年定额。很多人对她的计划持怀疑态度。有的说，别说一千头了，五百头也不一定有把握。但是，别洛娃的回答是，“我一定要作到”。
    别洛娃的计划得到了她那个国营农场场长的积极支持。场长和农艺师帮助她安排怎样合理选定养猪场的位置，以及如何利用一些机械化和自动化的工具来减少劳动。
    不久，别洛娃的养猪场就安置好了。养猪场里安装了自动喂料和自动给水的设备，猪场旁边就是大片的紫苜蓿和玉蜀黍、土豆等饲料产地。别洛娃科学地支配自己的时间，她按时上料、喂水，中午当猪休息的时候，她就留心察看所有猪只，一旦发现有不健康的，立即把它们和大群分开，进行个别照顾。这样，过了几个月，别洛娃虽然喂养一千头猪，但是仍然有空余时间。于是在7月里她又领了七百头仔猪来喂养，并且提出保证：今年要喂养大一千五百头。别洛娃喂的猪不仅多，而且猪长得也很快，例如，在7月间，她喂的猪每头每日平均长肉将近半公斤。
    除了由于共产主义的劳动热忱和机械化、自动化设备的条件外，别洛娃一个人能够喂养这么多猪的主要原因之一，是她采用了分类喂养的新方法。她把养猪场划分几个区，在每个区里安放不同类的猪。例如，一个区放专供繁殖用的母猪，另一个区专放繁殖一次后即当肉猪用的母猪，再一个区专放断了奶的小猪等等。这样，根据各类猪的特点，很便于照料喂养。
    由于采用了分类喂养的方法，别洛娃仅在今年一个夏天就为国营农场节约了十三万卢布。每公斤猪肉的成本降低到不到五个卢布，比去年下降了一半多。
    别洛娃非常热爱自己的工作，她一心一意想要在提前完成七年计划中贡献出更多的力量。她毫不满足于已得的成就，并提出更豪迈的计划：明年喂养大二千八百头猪，在整个七年计划期间，她准备喂养大一万头猪，交给国家七千五百公担肉！　（菱）（附图片）
