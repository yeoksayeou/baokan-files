Post-edit note:

    Further Improve the Collective Welfare Undertakings of Communes
    The collective welfare undertakings of the people's communes have developed vigorously in response to the urgent demands of the broad masses of commune members, especially women. With the establishment of public canteens, nurseries, and other collective welfare services, the lives of commune members have been guaranteed, a large amount of labor has been saved, and especially women's labor has been liberated, promoting the leap forward in agricultural production. Practice over the past year has proven that the development of collective welfare undertakings in the people's communes is not only conducive to the great leap forward in production, but also conducive to the consolidation and development of the people's communes.
    Some people say: "The conditions in the mountainous areas are poor, and canteens cannot be set up." Facts have proven that this is unfounded. Huangtugui Village in Mentougou District, Beijing, is a remote mountain village with only thirty-nine households. Water has to be carried from several miles away, and firewood has to be gathered from the mountains. The conditions are not good, but their canteen is doing very well. Most of the commune members are very satisfied and say: "Our canteen cannot be blown away by the wind, or split by a knife."
    Some people say: "Production is busy, and there is no time to run canteens and childcare organizations." In fact, this argument is even more untenable. The main purpose of running collective welfare undertakings is to liberate the productive forces and promote the great development of production. If it is not done when production is busy, when will it be done?
    At the recent suburban people's commune welfare work conference held by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the experience of the collective welfare undertakings of the people's communes was summarized based on practice over the past year. These experiences prove that as long as we work hard, we will definitely be able to further improve collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, and sewing organizations.

    进一步办好公社集体福利事业
    人民公社的集体福利事业，是适应广大社员，特别是妇女社员的迫切要求而蓬勃发展起来的。由于举办了公共食堂、托儿所等集体福利事业，保障了社员生活，节省了大量劳动力，特别是妇女劳力得到了解放，促进了农业生产的跃进。一年来的实践证明，人民公社集体福利事业的发展，不仅有利于生产大跃进，也有利于人民公社的巩固和发展。
    有的人说：“山区条件差，不能办食堂”。事实证明，这是没有根据的。北京市门头沟区黄土贵村是一个只有三十九户人家的偏僻小山村，吃水要到几里地以外去驮，烧柴得上山去打，条件并不好，但是他们的食堂却办得很好，绝大多数社员都很满意，说：“我们的食堂风吹不散，刀劈不开。”
    有的人说：“生产忙，没有时间办食堂、托儿组织”，其实，这种论调更是站不住脚的。办集体福利事业的主要目的，就是为了解放生产力，促进生产大发展，生产忙时不办，等到什么时候才办呢？
    在最近中共北京市委召开的郊区人民公社福利工作会议上，根据一年来的实践，总结了人民公社集体福利事业的经验。这些经验证明，只要认真努力，一定能进一步办好公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院、缝纫组织等集体福利事业。
