Over 1,200 employees on the grain front in Tianshui Prefecture, Gansu Province, have launched a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution campaign. As of late November, they had created and imitated 273 types of machinery and tools, totaling more than 990 pieces.

In terms of warehouse storage, some grain stations in Qin'an, Wushan, and Xili use weighing machines, bagging machines, and conveyors for grain receiving and dispatching; drying machines and grain cleaning machines for sorting grain; thermometers and other instruments for inspecting grain; and cranes for handling grain, increasing efficiency by five to ten times and achieving a semi-mechanized, streamlined process for grain entering and leaving the warehouse, sorting, and handling.

In the process of vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, grain stations and granaries throughout the district have implemented the policy of "walking on two legs," combining indigenous and foreign methods, utilizing local materials, and ensuring that technical innovation promotes business, while business practice enriches technical innovation.

    入库、整理、搬运、出仓齐革新
    天水专区保管粮食用机具
    甘肃省天水专区粮食战线一千二百多名职工，大闹技术革新和技术革命。截至11月下旬，已创造和仿制各种机具二百七十三种、九百九十多件。
    在仓储保管方面，秦安武山、西礼的一些粮站，收付粮食使用过磅机、装包机、输送机，整理粮食使用烘干机、净粮机，检验粮食使用量温计等仪器，搬运粮食使用起重机，提高工效五倍到十倍以上，实现了粮食出入库、整理、搬运一条龙的半机械化。
    全区的粮站和粮仓，在大搞技术革新和技术革命过程中，贯彻执行了“两条腿走路”的方针，土洋结合，就地取材，并且做到了以技术革新推动业务，又以业务实践充实技术革新。
