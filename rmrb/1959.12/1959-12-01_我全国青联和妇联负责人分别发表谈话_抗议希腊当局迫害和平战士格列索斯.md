    Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Leaders of the All-China Youth Federation issued a statement regarding the persecution of Greek peace fighter Glezos by the Greek authorities, saying:
    "The Greek authorities, disregarding the strong opposition of the Greek people and world opinion, are stubbornly continuing to persecute the well-known Greek patriot and peace fighter Manolis Glezos. Chinese youth express great indignation at this." "Glezos is a Greek national hero and a famous peace fighter. He has demonstrated a spirit of courage and fearlessness in the struggle against German fascist rule, against the aggression of American and British imperialism, and in defense of world peace. The Greek authorities' brutal persecution of Glezos and other patriots further exposes their reactionary face to the Greek people and the people of the world, and further promotes the Greek people's heroic struggle against their reactionary policy of selling out national interests.
    "At present, just as American imperialism is intensifying its control over Greece, turning Greece into an atomic war base threatening the Balkans and world peace, the Greek government's intensified persecution of democratic and patriotic forces is precisely to suppress the broad masses of people's resistance to its reactionary policy of selling out national interests and throwing itself into the arms of American imperialism. However, the Greek people and youth, with their glorious tradition of struggle against American imperialism and for democracy, will surely win victory. Chinese youth firmly support the righteous struggle of the Greek people and youth, and resolutely demand that the Greek authorities immediately release Glezos and other patriots. Get American imperialism out of Greece!"
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Today, the person in charge of the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China issued a statement regarding the repeated persecution of peace fighter Glezos by the Greek authorities, saying: "Upon hearing that the Greek reactionary authorities, blatantly disregarding the condemnation and protests of the Greek people and world public opinion, the Greek Athens Military Court of Appeals actually announced its rejection of the request to overturn the unjust verdict against Glezos and other Greek patriots, Chinese women feel boundless anger and express the strongest protest against the despicable and vicious conspiracy of the Greek ruling clique to illegally persecute Glezos and the tyrannical act of depriving human rights.
      "The trial of Glezos and other patriotic people by the Greek reactionary authorities was conducted in violation of Greek law. The only decree on which it was based was the so-called '375' law, and everyone knows that this is a reactionary law left over from the former fascist dictatorship in Greece to persecute Greek democratic progressive forces and patriots. The Greek authorities' willingness to invoke this notorious 'law' to persecute Glezos and other Greek patriots fully exposes the hideous features of the Greek reactionary authorities as fascists.
      "The Greek reactionary authorities are persecuting the heroic sons and daughters of the Greek people with fabricated charges, nothing more than to intensify the suppression of Greek patriotic and democratic forces, willingly act as accomplices of American imperialism, and clear the way for Greece to become a base for American imperialist atomic war. This is absolutely intolerable to the Greek people and all peace-loving people in the world. We believe that the Greek people's struggle for democracy, freedom, and peace cannot be stopped by any prisons or shackles. The glorious flag raised by Glezos in the Athens citadel still inspires the Greek people to move forward, and final victory will surely belong to the Greek patriots and the great Greek people.
    "Chinese women, together with peace-loving people and women all over the world, resolutely oppose the illegal persecution of Glezos and other Greek patriotic fighters by the Greek authorities. Once again, we demand that the Greek reactionary authorities immediately release Glezos and other Greek patriots and restore their freedom!"

    我全国青联和妇联负责人分别发表谈话
    抗议希腊当局迫害和平战士格列索斯
    新华社30日讯　中华全国青年联合会负责人就希腊当局迫害希腊和平战士格列索斯发表谈话说：
    “希腊当局不顾希腊人民和世界舆论的强烈反对，一意孤行地继续迫害希腊著名爱国者和和平战士曼诺里斯·格列索斯，中国青年对此表示极大的愤慨。”“格列索斯是希腊的民族英雄和著名的和平战士。他在反对德国法西斯统治、反对美、英帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争中表现出英勇无畏的精神。希腊当局对格列索斯和其他爱国人士的横暴迫害，进一步在希腊人民及全世界人民面前暴露其反动面目，更进一步促使希腊人民对其反动的出卖民族利益的政策进行英勇的斗争。
    “目前，正当美帝国主义加紧控制希腊、把希腊变为威胁巴尔干和世界和平的原子战争基地的时候，希腊政府对民主爱国力量的变本加厉的迫害，正是为了压制广大人民对它所奉行的出卖民族利益、投靠美帝国主义的反动政策的反抗。但是，具有光荣斗争传统的希腊人民和青年反对美帝国主义和争取民主的斗争必将获得胜利。中国青年坚决支持希腊人民和青年的正义斗争，并坚决要求希腊当局立即释放格列索斯和其他爱国人士。美国帝国主义从希腊滚出去！”
    新华社30日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会负责人今天就希腊当局一再迫害和平战士格列索斯发表谈话说：“闻悉希腊反动当局悍然不顾希腊人民和全世界公众舆论的谴责和抗议，希腊雅典军事上诉法庭竟宣布拒绝要求撤销对格列索斯和其他希腊爱国人士的不公正的判决。中国妇女对希腊统治集团这种非法迫害格列索斯的卑鄙毒恶的阴谋和剥夺人权的专横行为，感到无比的愤怒并表示最强烈的抗议。
      “希腊反动当局对格列索斯等爱国志士的审讯是在违反希腊法律的情况下进行的，它所依据的唯一的法令是所谓‘三七五’号法律，而谁都知道，这是希腊前法西斯专政时期遗留下来的迫害希腊民主进步力量和爱国者的反动透顶的法律。希腊当局不惜援引这项恶名昭彰的‘法律’来迫害格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者，这充分暴露了希腊反动当局法西斯的狰狞面目。
      “希腊反动当局以莫须有的罪名对希腊人民的英雄儿女加以迫害，不外是加紧镇压希腊的爱国民主力量，甘心充当美帝国主义的走卒，为希腊变成美帝国主义原子战争的基地扫清道路。这是希腊人民和全世界爱好和平的人民所绝不能容许的。我们相信希腊人民争取民主、自由与和平的斗争，决不是任何牢狱和镣铐所能阻止的，格列索斯在雅典城堡上竖起的这面光辉的旗子，仍然鼓舞着希腊人民前进，最后的胜利一定属于希腊爱国者和伟大的希腊人民。
    “中国妇女和全世界爱好和平的人民和妇女一道，坚决反对希腊当局非法迫害格列索斯和其他希腊爱国志士。我们再一次要求希腊反动当局立即释放格列索斯和其他希腊爱国志士，并恢复他们的自由！”
